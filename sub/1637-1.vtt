01:45.640 --> 01:47.881
Fuck me.

01:48.280 --> 01:51.250
I can't believe
I'm going to die in this place.

01:52.200 --> 01:56.922
But, as far as headstones go,
a man could do a lot worse.

01:59.680 --> 02:01.364
I'm Charlie Wolfe.

02:01.520 --> 02:06.128
And as I lie here, waiting
for death's cold embrace,

02:06.280 --> 02:08.886
I find myself asking the question,

02:09.039 --> 02:12.169
"How the fuck did it come to this?"

02:12.360 --> 02:15.284
I don't die. I thrive.

02:48.200 --> 02:49.645
Fuck.

04:23.880 --> 04:25.211
Fuck!

04:50.880 --> 04:53.884
Yeah? Yeah.

04:55.480 --> 04:57.989
I'm... I'm sorry. Could you
hang on one second?

05:05.200 --> 05:07.395
Yeah, I'll be there in an hour.

06:38.600 --> 06:40.170
Good morning.
Doctor Webb Dental Surgery.

06:40.320 --> 06:43.085
Hi, Lucy. This is Alice.

06:43.240 --> 06:44.401
Hi, Alice.

06:44.560 --> 06:46.608
Do you think Nathan
can see me this afternoon?

06:46.800 --> 06:48.689
I'm actually in a lot of pain.

06:48.880 --> 06:52.521
Sure. I think we can fit you in.

06:52.720 --> 06:54.085
How's 2:00?

06:54.240 --> 06:55.844
Perfect. I'll see you at 2:00.

06:56.000 --> 06:57.604
Alright. See you later.

07:01.160 --> 07:02.161
Nathan!

07:02.280 --> 07:03.327
Come on, mate.

07:03.520 --> 07:05.648
Please just sort me out
this one last time.

07:05.800 --> 07:08.371
Fifty thousand on Silver Tsar to win.

07:10.040 --> 07:12.566
Thanks. You're a saint.

07:13.580 --> 07:15.209
Nathan!

07:16.640 --> 07:18.369
Change of plans. She's coming today.

07:20.080 --> 07:21.366
I'm not ready.

07:21.520 --> 07:22.567
We've got no choice.

07:23.000 --> 07:26.049
Switch my dental records and
let's get my car to the quarry.

07:27.960 --> 07:29.200
Shit.

08:37.240 --> 08:38.287
She's here.

08:38.799 --> 08:41.280
Have you swapped those dental records?

09:09.000 --> 09:10.604
- Hi.
- Hi.

09:10.760 --> 09:12.683
- I'm sorry I'm late.
- It's okay.

09:12.840 --> 09:16.401
- What happened?
- Oh, I hit the door.

09:16.560 --> 09:18.085
Oh, you poor thing!

09:19.120 --> 09:21.282
Nathan, Alice is here!

09:26.280 --> 09:29.250
- Hi, Nathan.
- Hi, Alice.

09:29.400 --> 09:30.401
Okay.

09:30.560 --> 09:33.211
- Yeah, shall we?
- Yeah.

10:13.520 --> 10:15.329
Do I really need an injection?

10:16.120 --> 10:17.849
Yes. But I will be gentle.

10:18.000 --> 10:19.161
I think I...

10:19.320 --> 10:21.448
Now, lie back... and open.

10:49.720 --> 10:51.768
Took you long enough. Is she out?

10:51.960 --> 10:53.121
Cold.

10:53.720 --> 10:55.210
- Grab her jewelry.
- Yeah.

11:12.800 --> 11:15.690
- Did you see something?
- No.

11:16.360 --> 11:17.930
You remember the petrol?

11:19.520 --> 11:20.601
Must I think of everything?

11:20.720 --> 11:22.085
There's a garage on the way.

11:23.160 --> 11:26.164
Don't take forever. I'll be waiting.

11:42.400 --> 11:44.402
Ready to go in the fifth event,
Blacktown...

11:47.600 --> 11:49.364
Silver Tsar's coming up...

12:12.760 --> 12:14.603
Here's Silver Tsar taking to the outside

12:14.760 --> 12:17.001
and the well-tried favorite lights up.

12:17.160 --> 12:19.401
It's Silver Tsar racing
the Blacktown Lad and Daytone.

12:19.560 --> 12:20.891
- He's taken over the running.
- Get up!

12:21.040 --> 12:22.724
And the favorite's looking
really good at the moment.

12:22.880 --> 12:24.211
He raced two lengths in front of...

12:26.840 --> 12:28.649
Not now, not now. Please, not now.

12:32.520 --> 12:34.727
Silver Tsar has the lead
but he's getting tired.

12:34.880 --> 12:37.087
Daytone's coming back
and so is Madison Rose.

12:37.240 --> 12:39.029
Oh, there's a fall! The favorite's down!

12:39.220 --> 12:40.890
- Shit!
- Silver Tsar's fallen.

12:41.040 --> 12:42.280
- You wouldn't believe it.
- Shit!

12:42.440 --> 12:45.564
- Shit, shit, shit!
- Victory in his sights and he's down...

12:53.360 --> 12:56.648
...wonder of the world, and down
he went with only 50m to go.

12:56.800 --> 12:59.565
Que sera. That's racing, I guess.

12:59.720 --> 13:02.564
It's bad luck for the punters
that they lose their money.

14:03.160 --> 14:04.889
Fucking hell!

14:17.880 --> 14:19.041
Fuck!

14:37.400 --> 14:38.481
Nathan, how are you going?

14:38.640 --> 14:41.883
I'm alright.
I've just... just got a flat.

14:42.040 --> 14:43.530
Oh, yeah. Need a hand?

14:43.680 --> 14:46.047
Nah, all good. I got it.

14:46.200 --> 14:47.645
No worries at all, mate.

14:48.000 --> 14:49.081
Thanks.

14:55.920 --> 14:57.126
You still planning on leaving?

14:57.280 --> 14:59.169
I'm way beyond planning.

14:59.680 --> 15:01.728
I'm doing. Today.

15:02.870 --> 15:04.511
Good on you.

15:07.560 --> 15:08.766
Do you need anything else?

15:09.520 --> 15:13.081
Yeah... you got any large waters?

15:14.440 --> 15:16.841
- Yeah, I've got some out the back.
- Thanks.

15:32.720 --> 15:34.051
Are you a tourist?

15:38.680 --> 15:39.920
Something like that.

15:42.080 --> 15:43.320
Here you go.

15:43.840 --> 15:45.763
Sorry it's not cold. Just the one?

15:45.960 --> 15:48.327
Yeah, better give me
$20 worth of petrol.

15:48.560 --> 15:49.641
Yeah, no worries.

15:55.040 --> 15:56.644
You can't smoke in here.

16:04.920 --> 16:07.810
Cheers, Dylan. Good luck.

17:14.119 --> 17:15.884
What kept you this time?

17:16.040 --> 17:17.280
I got a flat.

17:17.440 --> 17:19.282
It's always something with you.

17:19.440 --> 17:20.646
It was an accident.

17:20.800 --> 17:22.801
Come on, then. Let's get on with it.

17:22.960 --> 17:24.689
It's you we should be insuring, not me.

18:05.800 --> 18:07.882
- Oh... shit!
- Oh, fuck!

18:31.400 --> 18:32.731
Nathan!

18:33.760 --> 18:36.206
Don't worry. It'll sink.

18:39.560 --> 18:41.050
Soon.

18:42.440 --> 18:43.521
Get in there!

18:43.720 --> 18:45.370
Alright.

18:59.920 --> 19:01.604
Fuck, Luce, it's really cold.

19:11.920 --> 19:13.160
Let's go.

19:15.720 --> 19:17.085
Fuck me.

20:02.120 --> 20:03.451
Grab the bag.

20:05.800 --> 20:07.928
- Petrol?
- In the back seat.

20:10.920 --> 20:12.490
What the fuck is this?

20:12.640 --> 20:13.641
It's the petrol.

20:13.800 --> 20:15.245
Where's the rest of it?

20:15.440 --> 20:16.566
That'll be enough.

20:24.720 --> 20:25.881
Argh!

20:27.280 --> 20:28.406
Alice...

20:29.120 --> 20:30.281
calm down.

20:33.280 --> 20:34.406
Fuck!

20:35.360 --> 20:37.567
Nathan, get up! She's getting away!

20:37.720 --> 20:39.165
Oh, fuck's sake!

20:46.199 --> 20:47.480
Oi!

20:57.240 --> 20:58.651
Lucy!

21:08.920 --> 21:10.001
Fuck.

21:39.760 --> 21:41.489
- Hey.
- Let's fucking do this.

21:41.640 --> 21:44.041
- Where is she?
- In the back seat.

22:06.960 --> 22:08.803
- Jewelry's on the dash.
- Yeah.

22:10.280 --> 22:11.691
Just get her in.

22:11.840 --> 22:13.365
Not so fucking easy.

22:13.560 --> 22:16.404
Hey, you don't have to be so gentle.
Just get her in there.

22:17.800 --> 22:19.131
Okay.

22:31.480 --> 22:32.845
Sorry, Alice.

22:47.440 --> 22:49.010
Goodbye, Alice.

23:43.040 --> 23:45.566
No, I'm fine. I can't. I'm working.

23:45.720 --> 23:46.926
Great.

23:48.440 --> 23:49.601
Alright, ready?

23:49.760 --> 23:51.000
Cheers!

23:56.360 --> 23:59.210
I agreed to help out but not so
you can sit around on your fucking ass.

23:59.760 --> 24:00.886
I'll be another minute.

24:01.400 --> 24:03.971
- Jack, we need to talk.
- Not now.

24:05.080 --> 24:06.411
Your marriage is a joke.

24:06.520 --> 24:09.285
She's given up
on your whole pathetic act.

24:12.400 --> 24:13.765
Do you know that you're the la...

24:15.080 --> 24:16.411
Enough.

24:16.920 --> 24:18.763
Why don't you and your deadbeat husband

24:18.920 --> 24:20.763
mind your own fucking business?

24:21.960 --> 24:23.689
Jack, you're my brother.

24:23.840 --> 24:26.446
I can't just stand by
and watch this happen.

24:26.600 --> 24:27.965
Are you done?

24:28.120 --> 24:29.770
Have you made that call?

24:31.680 --> 24:34.081
Hire him and have her followed.

24:35.960 --> 24:39.089
If I'm wrong,
then I won't say another word.

25:09.920 --> 25:11.922
Jack, we need to get more tequi...

25:16.960 --> 25:18.530
When did you get a gun?

25:19.520 --> 25:20.851
Is everything okay?

25:31.080 --> 25:32.286
Sit down.

25:53.468 --> 25:54.811
Pick it up.

25:54.920 --> 25:56.331
Please put the gun down.

25:56.480 --> 25:58.130
I said pick it fucking up.

26:03.120 --> 26:05.088
Do you have any idea
how much I love you?

26:17.760 --> 26:19.410
You don't love me.

26:22.480 --> 26:24.244
You just want to control me.

26:34.160 --> 26:35.491
Alice.

26:36.600 --> 26:38.409
Are you seeing someone else?

26:39.360 --> 26:41.362
'Cause I couldn't handle
something like that.

26:43.400 --> 26:45.084
I'd sooner see you dead.

26:46.880 --> 26:48.291
I need to go.

27:23.720 --> 27:25.223
Yeah.

27:26.780 --> 27:28.525
Sorry, just hold on a sec.

27:35.400 --> 27:36.970
Yeah, I'll be there in an hour.

29:38.360 --> 29:40.647
- What are you doing?
- Jack, you're hurting me.

29:42.440 --> 29:43.930
What are you fucking doing
sneaking around?

29:44.080 --> 29:45.286
I wasn't sneaking around.

29:54.880 --> 29:56.484
That's the last time you hit me.

29:58.600 --> 30:00.284
Alice, I'm sorry!

30:49.960 --> 30:51.530
Yeah, your tooth is chipped.

31:07.105 --> 31:08.646
Sorry, it's all I've got.

31:11.320 --> 31:12.731
Thank you.

31:19.240 --> 31:21.288
You'll be okay on your own for a few?

31:21.480 --> 31:24.006
Why? Where are you going?

31:25.040 --> 31:26.405
I'm gonna pay Jack a visit.

31:26.560 --> 31:29.131
Dylan... Dylan.

31:29.320 --> 31:30.526
Dylan!

31:33.320 --> 31:34.685
Come here.

31:38.200 --> 31:39.260
Stay with me.

31:39.360 --> 31:41.283
Somebody needs to sort that prick out.

31:41.560 --> 31:43.210
Stay with me.

31:44.440 --> 31:45.851
Please?

31:49.560 --> 31:50.800
Please.

32:56.400 --> 32:58.402
Jack wasn't always like this.

32:58.720 --> 33:00.688
Doesn't excuse what he does.

33:02.000 --> 33:03.809
You know what he told me earlier?

33:06.200 --> 33:09.443
That he'd sooner see me dead
than with another guy.

33:09.600 --> 33:11.170
He actually said that?

33:11.840 --> 33:13.569
The scariest part...

33:16.320 --> 33:19.961
...is that he was pointing this at me
when he said that.

33:21.960 --> 33:23.200
Fucking hell.

33:23.880 --> 33:25.644
Good thing we're leaving tomorrow.

33:32.600 --> 33:34.170
You sure you want to go?

33:34.800 --> 33:36.768
Of course I'm sure.

33:37.040 --> 33:39.327
But you haven't sold the garage yet.

33:39.480 --> 33:40.845
Things will be tight.

33:41.880 --> 33:44.326
Money's always a problem
when you don't have much.

33:44.560 --> 33:46.722
I'll get a job.

33:48.400 --> 33:50.562
We can make enough for the both of us.

35:29.280 --> 35:31.681
Sure. I think we can fit you in.

35:33.520 --> 35:34.760
How's 2:00?

35:34.920 --> 35:36.331
Perfect. I'll see you at 2:00.

35:36.480 --> 35:37.811
Alright. See you later.

35:41.840 --> 35:43.001
Nathan!

35:54.200 --> 35:55.725
Are you sober?

35:59.760 --> 36:01.046
Mostly.

36:05.480 --> 36:06.606
I'm sorry, Alice.

36:06.760 --> 36:08.091
You're always sorry.

36:21.160 --> 36:23.367
- Yeah.
- This is Charlie Wolfe.

36:23.520 --> 36:24.567
Hang on.

36:24.720 --> 36:26.529
Oi. Shut the door?

36:34.320 --> 36:35.446
Yeah.

36:35.600 --> 36:37.568
I have something you might want to see.

36:38.720 --> 36:40.085
Okay.

36:40.240 --> 36:41.526
Should I drop in?

36:41.680 --> 36:42.920
No.

36:43.880 --> 36:46.167
You know the car park by Merchant Rock?

36:46.320 --> 36:47.845
I'll be there in an hour.

36:51.000 --> 36:52.604
Hey, Bruce.

36:55.360 --> 36:56.805
Where's Jack?

36:56.960 --> 36:58.450
In his office.

37:08.040 --> 37:09.530
You must be tired.

37:09.680 --> 37:11.284
Yeah, a little.

37:11.440 --> 37:13.522
Running around town the way you do.

37:14.600 --> 37:16.409
All hours of the day and night.

37:17.520 --> 37:18.931
Excuse me?

37:19.600 --> 37:22.649
- Bruce.
- Jack. The very man.

37:22.840 --> 37:25.081
Just checking on that
case of whisky you promised.

37:25.240 --> 37:27.322
Is later alright, mate?
I'm just heading out.

37:27.720 --> 37:31.008
Yeah. Long as it's not too much later.

37:32.160 --> 37:33.605
Right?

37:40.080 --> 37:41.844
Give us your car keys.

37:42.000 --> 37:43.081
What's wrong with your car?

37:43.280 --> 37:44.770
It's still at the paint shop.

37:46.520 --> 37:48.090
Will you be long?

37:48.560 --> 37:50.050
As long as it takes.

37:50.240 --> 37:53.323
I have an appointment
with Nathan at 2:00.

38:07.600 --> 38:08.965
Fuck.

38:17.520 --> 38:18.646
Shit.

40:58.360 --> 40:59.725
Wolfe!

41:10.560 --> 41:12.369
I didn't expect your call so soon.

41:12.520 --> 41:14.602
Sometimes they make it too easy.

41:27.320 --> 41:28.560
This was last night?

41:33.800 --> 41:35.165
Jesus.

41:37.280 --> 41:38.520
Do you have something for me?

41:44.160 --> 41:45.366
I'm keeping this.

41:45.800 --> 41:47.006
Be my guest.

41:47.160 --> 41:48.650
I bought it just for you.

41:51.840 --> 41:53.763
You feel like staying on for a few days?

41:54.600 --> 41:56.284
No sense hanging around.

41:56.440 --> 41:58.602
I've got something for you,
if you're interested.

42:00.760 --> 42:01.761
I'm listening.

42:01.920 --> 42:03.410
How does 50 grand sound?

42:04.840 --> 42:06.444
Like a dirty job.

42:06.960 --> 42:08.644
And I'm still listening.

42:10.560 --> 42:12.369
I want you to kill my wife.

42:12.520 --> 42:14.568
Make the bitch disappear.

42:14.760 --> 42:17.730
Jack, you've worked yourself
into a knot over this thing.

42:17.880 --> 42:19.006
Fine.

42:19.160 --> 42:21.401
You're reacting badly to some bad news.

42:21.600 --> 42:24.001
- Just take some time.
- My mind is clear.

42:24.160 --> 42:28.085
What you're talking about is a
one-way street. You understand?

42:28.240 --> 42:31.164
Once you start, there is no going back.

42:36.520 --> 42:38.363
She's had fair warning.

42:38.920 --> 42:42.527
She knew the consequences
and she did it anyway.

42:42.800 --> 42:44.086
So fuck her.

42:44.640 --> 42:46.165
You want my money or not?

42:53.905 --> 42:56.242
Do you have that sort
of cash just lying around?

42:56.400 --> 42:57.606
It's covered.

42:57.800 --> 43:01.490
I mean untraceable. This kind of job
doesn't come with a receipt.

43:01.680 --> 43:03.045
I told you, it's covered.

43:03.200 --> 43:05.567
There is, of course, the issue of trust.

43:05.720 --> 43:06.801
I trust you.

43:06.920 --> 43:08.081
Yes, but how can I be sure

43:08.200 --> 43:09.964
you're not gonna go soft on me, Jack?

43:10.160 --> 43:11.969
Well, we'll have to trust each other.

43:14.200 --> 43:16.202
Did you and your wife
ever trust each other?

43:16.880 --> 43:18.769
You don't want the job? Fine.
Forget I asked.

43:18.960 --> 43:20.644
I don't remember saying no.

43:20.800 --> 43:22.370
So are you saying yes?

43:29.120 --> 43:30.485
Alright, I'll do it.

43:31.320 --> 43:33.209
But not for 50 grand.

43:33.640 --> 43:35.051
How much?

43:35.200 --> 43:36.611
My rate's an even one.

43:36.800 --> 43:38.086
Sixty?

43:38.240 --> 43:40.561
No, 100.

43:41.800 --> 43:43.723
I'm what you call a professional.

43:43.880 --> 43:45.609
Quality always costs.

43:46.400 --> 43:47.970
So are we on?

43:51.640 --> 43:53.847
She has a dental appointment at 2:00.

43:55.920 --> 43:58.161
I'd be fine with her never coming home.

43:59.160 --> 44:00.571
Alright, here's what I want you to do.

44:00.720 --> 44:04.486
Go back to the bar,
and stay there, in plain sight.

44:04.640 --> 44:06.847
Smile for everyone, and don't act funny.

44:07.000 --> 44:08.365
I'll contact you when it's done.

44:08.640 --> 44:10.563
I'll be expecting your call.

44:10.880 --> 44:12.325
Oh, Jack?

44:12.920 --> 44:14.604
Don't go putting that online, now,
will you?

44:18.280 --> 44:19.645
Lucy.

44:19.920 --> 44:21.285
I can't go through with it.

44:22.960 --> 44:24.325
Can't?

44:26.920 --> 44:28.206
Shit.

44:32.640 --> 44:34.005
Whatever he wants, get rid of him.

44:34.120 --> 44:35.326
I'll handle it.

44:42.880 --> 44:44.882
G'day, Bruce. How are you going?

44:50.960 --> 44:54.050
I was up the big smoke last night.
Met a bookmaker we all know.

44:54.640 --> 44:56.369
- Who's that?
- Evan Black.

44:56.520 --> 44:59.126
- You know Evan?
- He's a relative.

45:00.120 --> 45:01.485
I had no idea.

45:02.440 --> 45:04.329
You know how it is around here.

45:04.480 --> 45:06.164
We're all related one way or another.

45:06.640 --> 45:08.927
Yeah. Small world.

45:09.080 --> 45:10.969
Evan says you've been avoiding him.

45:11.840 --> 45:12.921
Says you owe him heaps of money,

45:13.040 --> 45:14.724
and so far you haven't made
good on a single marker.

45:14.880 --> 45:18.089
Look, it's okay. I am gonna pay him.

45:18.240 --> 45:20.208
- I gave him my word.
- Fuck your word.

45:21.000 --> 45:22.286
He wants his money.

45:22.440 --> 45:25.569
And he will get it, on my oath.

45:26.480 --> 45:28.289
You disrespected him.

45:28.600 --> 45:30.648
He arranged for the lads
to come see you.

45:31.800 --> 45:33.370
But I talked him out of it.

45:34.880 --> 45:36.689
I said I'd come see you first.

45:37.120 --> 45:39.361
Promised him I'd collect
everything you owe.

45:39.680 --> 45:40.660
Within the week.

45:40.760 --> 45:43.411
Failing that... I'd kill you meself.

45:47.880 --> 45:50.008
Bruce... we're good for the money.

45:50.160 --> 45:52.481
Well, we will be.

45:53.240 --> 45:55.242
I just need a little bit more time.

45:57.160 --> 45:58.286
How much time?

45:58.480 --> 45:59.720
Couple of months.

46:03.000 --> 46:05.082
- You're taking the piss.
- No.

46:05.760 --> 46:08.843
Where's this money
coming from in a few months?

46:09.800 --> 46:12.804
I can't tell you,
but it is real, okay? I promise.

46:12.960 --> 46:15.088
Don't come the raw fuckin' prawn.

46:15.240 --> 46:16.730
You've got one week.

46:16.880 --> 46:19.167
We're talking about near 250 grand.

46:19.320 --> 46:21.049
That was before.

46:21.200 --> 46:22.884
- Before what?
- Me.

46:23.480 --> 46:24.641
How much now?

46:24.840 --> 46:26.410
Now?

46:26.760 --> 46:29.965
Now we're talking about a figure so close
to $300,000 we may as well call it that.

46:30.120 --> 46:32.043
No, we never agreed to that.
Are you insane?

46:32.200 --> 46:34.089
- Non-negotiable.
- You can't be serious.

46:34.240 --> 46:36.607
Let me show you how serious
I am. Come here.

46:37.760 --> 46:39.046
Nah, it's alright.

46:39.200 --> 46:41.487
- Bruce, please.
- Don't have me ask twice.

46:41.720 --> 46:43.768
Bruce! Bruce!

46:44.560 --> 46:47.040
You've got one week.

46:47.480 --> 46:48.481
Now, say it.

46:50.280 --> 46:51.930
Bruce, stop.

47:00.160 --> 47:01.764
You think he got the message?

47:03.520 --> 47:05.602
- Well?
- Yes.

47:05.800 --> 47:08.007
Bruce, we get it, okay?
We've got a week.

47:08.160 --> 47:09.491
Or else?

47:12.320 --> 47:14.209
I'm asking you.

47:14.880 --> 47:16.006
Or...

47:16.160 --> 47:17.764
You'll kill us.

47:21.640 --> 47:23.085
Have the money in a week.

47:48.680 --> 47:51.160
Lucy, I'm sorry.

47:51.320 --> 47:52.606
Don't touch me!

47:57.120 --> 47:58.724
You just stood there.

47:59.360 --> 48:01.647
I didn't mean for any of this to happen.

48:04.480 --> 48:06.084
We go ahead with it.

48:06.440 --> 48:08.966
We need that insurance money
more than ever now.

48:09.160 --> 48:10.321
Okay.

48:33.920 --> 48:35.410
Where have you been? I'm late.

48:35.560 --> 48:37.005
Went for a drive.

48:37.160 --> 48:38.286
My car keys?

49:17.160 --> 49:18.650
Goodbye, Alice.

49:39.800 --> 49:41.404
Oh, my God!

49:41.800 --> 49:43.609
Shit! No!

50:10.560 --> 50:12.164
How do you like their house?

50:14.040 --> 50:15.963
Are you certain they're overseas?

50:16.120 --> 50:17.690
For the next six months.

50:22.800 --> 50:24.882
You do know the code, don't you?

50:25.320 --> 50:27.527
Max told me there was
an easy way to remember it.

50:27.800 --> 50:29.404
Obviously.

50:31.400 --> 50:32.970
Beethoven.

50:33.120 --> 50:34.690
- What?
- The code.

50:34.880 --> 50:37.770
It's 1812, after the overture.

50:40.360 --> 50:42.840
That's Tchaikovsky, you idiot.

51:37.200 --> 51:38.761
Shit.

51:39.920 --> 51:42.366
Lucy, have you got
any of my contacts here?

51:43.360 --> 51:44.566
Yeah.

51:46.160 --> 51:49.369
In my toiletry bag. I'll get it.

51:54.960 --> 51:56.371
What's that?

51:56.720 --> 51:58.688
I was gonna tell you about it.

51:59.000 --> 52:01.401
I found it in her car when
I was waiting for you earlier.

52:04.800 --> 52:06.643
It just slipped my mind
with all that was going on.

52:06.800 --> 52:08.211
How much?

52:09.440 --> 52:13.206
About...$250,000.

52:14.480 --> 52:16.369
Quarter of a million dollars.

52:17.120 --> 52:18.770
And you just forgot about it?

52:20.360 --> 52:22.203
We didn't have to kill her, did we?

52:22.360 --> 52:23.486
What are you talking about?!

52:23.640 --> 52:24.880
We could have used
that money to pay Bruce.

52:25.040 --> 52:27.771
By the time I found it,
we were already committed.

52:30.800 --> 52:32.290
Very convenient.

52:34.920 --> 52:36.684
Believe me, there is nothing convenient

52:36.880 --> 52:39.008
about this mess that you got us into!

52:40.240 --> 52:41.480
Hey.

52:41.920 --> 52:43.285
Hey.

52:45.120 --> 52:48.727
I'm sick and tired of
having barely enough.

52:49.960 --> 52:51.769
I want more.

52:52.560 --> 52:54.289
So should you.

53:05.160 --> 53:06.366
I'm off.

53:06.520 --> 53:09.524
Why? Why do you have to leave?

53:09.680 --> 53:11.808
I'll come back when I get a chance.

53:13.120 --> 53:14.360
Okay.

53:15.080 --> 53:16.684
Why are you taking that?

53:17.480 --> 53:19.209
I'll keep it safe.

53:49.600 --> 53:50.840
Hello, Jack.

53:51.800 --> 53:54.007
- You.
- Me.

54:00.120 --> 54:01.201
Is it done?

54:01.360 --> 54:02.885
I wouldn't be here if it weren't.

54:03.040 --> 54:04.405
She's dead?

54:06.920 --> 54:09.651
- How'd you do it?
- Oh, easy there, Jack.

54:09.800 --> 54:11.450
The less you know, the better.

54:11.640 --> 54:14.844
That way, if people start
asking questions, you don't have to lie.

54:15.840 --> 54:17.569
- She's...
- Gone.

54:18.480 --> 54:20.005
Forever.

54:33.760 --> 54:36.809
You planning on drinking
yourself to death, Jack?

54:37.760 --> 54:39.125
Maybe.

54:39.560 --> 54:41.289
Your business is your own.

54:43.160 --> 54:44.810
As long as we're square.

54:47.880 --> 54:49.450
You got some proof for me?

54:49.600 --> 54:52.046
Or am I supposed to just take your word?

54:52.800 --> 54:54.165
What, you don't trust me anymore?

54:57.960 --> 54:59.689
I'd have thought you'd be glad
to be rid of her.

55:00.440 --> 55:01.487
Answer to all your problems.

55:01.640 --> 55:03.483
Despite what you think,

55:03.640 --> 55:05.290
I love my wife very much.

55:06.280 --> 55:07.781
Too much.

55:07.931 --> 55:09.927
Well, you've got a crazy way
of showing it.

55:10.320 --> 55:12.322
Nobody makes a fool out of me.

55:13.880 --> 55:15.166
It's gone.

55:18.000 --> 55:19.843
I don't like the sound of that.

55:24.640 --> 55:26.005
Alice.

55:26.560 --> 55:29.928
You wouldn't be playing games
with me, would you, Jack?

55:30.080 --> 55:31.366
What?

55:31.840 --> 55:33.285
No, don't worry. I have more.

55:33.440 --> 55:35.010
Where?

55:35.160 --> 55:38.004
At the safety deposit box at the bank.

55:38.160 --> 55:40.083
Had me worried for a moment.

55:41.760 --> 55:43.603
What time shall I come back tomorrow?

55:45.400 --> 55:46.561
Give me till 3:00.

55:46.720 --> 55:48.131
Let's make it 2:00.

55:52.240 --> 55:54.766
Jack, all this talk of booze
has got me quite thirsty.

55:54.920 --> 55:57.287
You wouldn't know of any good
bars in the area, would you?

57:37.960 --> 57:39.200
Shit.

57:51.160 --> 57:52.400
Hi, Bruce.

57:55.080 --> 57:56.525
Where's Lucy?

57:58.320 --> 58:00.561
Oh, she hasn't showed up for work yet.

58:01.760 --> 58:03.250
You know why I'm here?

58:04.400 --> 58:05.731
Yeah.

58:05.880 --> 58:07.769
You said I had a week,
so that gives me at least...

58:07.960 --> 58:09.485
Don't play games.

58:10.440 --> 58:12.124
I'm here on police business.

58:12.880 --> 58:14.769
You know anything about a crash?

58:15.240 --> 58:16.730
Up on Devil's Rocks Road?

58:17.760 --> 58:19.330
No. Should I?

58:20.160 --> 58:21.764
I didn't think you had the balls, mate.

58:22.000 --> 58:23.161
What are you talking about?

58:23.320 --> 58:26.085
I found Lucy's car,
or what's left of it.

58:27.680 --> 58:30.286
This thing has insurance job
written all over it.

58:34.760 --> 58:36.444
Don't bullshit me.

58:38.480 --> 58:40.767
You got a policy in your wife's name?

58:41.360 --> 58:42.600
Yes.

58:43.560 --> 58:46.245
Well, one word from me
in the wrong man's ear

58:46.400 --> 58:49.483
and that claim won't clear
for a bloody long time.

58:50.160 --> 58:52.208
But I'm also in a position
to make this thing

58:52.360 --> 58:55.364
go your way without a hitch,
open and shut case.

58:56.080 --> 58:59.482
But for these services,
I need to be compensated.

59:02.040 --> 59:03.610
I'm listening.

59:04.360 --> 59:05.964
- I want half.
- Half?

59:06.120 --> 59:09.522
Half of what's left
after you settle your debts.

59:09.680 --> 59:10.966
No way!

59:12.960 --> 59:15.008
Consider your options, Nathan.

59:15.160 --> 59:17.845
Okay? I'm being very generous.
Don't insult me.

59:18.000 --> 59:20.002
You got a copy of your wife's
dental records?

59:20.200 --> 59:22.168
Hey? Save me a trip back here
after I ring this in.

59:22.320 --> 59:23.651
Yes.

59:30.800 --> 59:32.131
Here.

59:34.560 --> 59:36.324
I underestimated you, mate.

59:37.360 --> 59:38.646
Your own wife.

59:40.280 --> 59:42.089
You're a heartless fucker.

01:00:03.600 --> 01:00:05.181
Luce.

01:00:06.240 --> 01:00:07.946
Lucy!

01:00:17.120 --> 01:00:18.281
Lucy!

01:00:42.320 --> 01:00:43.685
Bit of a problem.

01:00:45.920 --> 01:00:47.251
Read this.

01:00:59.720 --> 01:01:01.324
When did you get this?

01:01:01.480 --> 01:01:02.891
Earlier.

01:01:04.720 --> 01:01:06.449
Do you have any idea who sent it?

01:01:06.640 --> 01:01:07.880
No.

01:01:09.480 --> 01:01:10.766
Do you?

01:01:12.680 --> 01:01:15.524
What? Of course not.

01:01:16.160 --> 01:01:18.527
Two hundred and fifty thousand dollars.

01:01:19.680 --> 01:01:21.364
Bit of a coincidence, don't you think?

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.048
The email says he's watching us.

01:01:24.440 --> 01:01:25.441
He?

01:01:25.600 --> 01:01:27.250
Oh, you think it's a she?

01:01:27.400 --> 01:01:28.925
Maybe.

01:01:29.480 --> 01:01:31.562
- You're being ridiculous.
- Am I?

01:01:32.480 --> 01:01:36.041
Well, he or she, all they
mention here is 250 grand.

01:01:36.520 --> 01:01:37.646
So?

01:01:37.800 --> 01:01:39.609
So obviously they don't know
about the insurance policy

01:01:39.760 --> 01:01:41.171
or they'd be after a lot more.

01:01:41.640 --> 01:01:43.404
You think we should pay?

01:01:44.320 --> 01:01:45.757
Fuck.

01:01:48.280 --> 01:01:50.044
I think we have a chance
to end this cheap.

01:01:50.200 --> 01:01:51.645
Cheap?

01:01:52.080 --> 01:01:53.241
In comparison.

01:01:53.680 --> 01:01:55.842
Besides, I don't see too many options.

01:01:57.520 --> 01:01:58.931
Maybe.

01:02:00.040 --> 01:02:01.804
You still have the money, don't you?

01:02:02.680 --> 01:02:03.966
In the car.

01:02:04.120 --> 01:02:05.485
Why?

01:02:07.760 --> 01:02:10.240
Thought maybe you'd
gambled it away already.

01:02:10.400 --> 01:02:11.890
Don't start.

01:02:13.760 --> 01:02:15.603
- You coming?
- Where?

01:02:15.760 --> 01:02:17.489
Where do you think?

01:02:18.160 --> 01:02:19.969
I'm dead, remember?

01:02:48.760 --> 01:02:49.807
Where is she?

01:02:49.960 --> 01:02:51.325
Come here.

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:06.331
Who the fuck do you think you are

01:03:06.480 --> 01:03:08.847
coming in here
accusing me of what, exactly?

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:10.570
I want to know what you did.

01:03:14.640 --> 01:03:16.290
What about what you did?

01:03:22.360 --> 01:03:23.964
I had you followed.

01:03:28.120 --> 01:03:30.407
- I want my money back.
- What money?

01:03:30.640 --> 01:03:33.041
I know she took it,
I know she gave it to you,

01:03:33.280 --> 01:03:34.327
and I want it back.

01:03:34.480 --> 01:03:35.527
I haven't got your money.

01:03:38.560 --> 01:03:40.289
Is that right?

01:03:47.760 --> 01:03:49.842
You looking for this?

01:03:53.640 --> 01:03:54.926
Where is she?

01:03:55.360 --> 01:03:56.725
You gonna shoot me?

01:03:59.720 --> 01:04:01.643
Just tell me where she is.

01:04:04.360 --> 01:04:05.885
Fuck you.

01:04:07.120 --> 01:04:08.690
Argh!

01:04:09.760 --> 01:04:12.286
Argh! Fuck!

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:16.527
You fucking shot me! You fucking prick!

01:04:17.440 --> 01:04:18.805
Where is she?!

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:20.365
I don't know!

01:04:20.520 --> 01:04:22.204
He wouldn't tell me.

01:04:22.360 --> 01:04:23.486
Who?

01:04:23.640 --> 01:04:25.608
The guy I hired.
The one who shot the video!

01:04:25.760 --> 01:04:27.842
- What's his fucking name?
- Wolfe! Charlie Wolfe!

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:29.604
Where can I find him?

01:04:29.800 --> 01:04:31.962
Here, a little later.

01:04:32.920 --> 01:04:34.331
Why?

01:04:35.200 --> 01:04:37.202
He still has to get paid.

01:04:40.720 --> 01:04:42.210
Paid for what?

01:04:45.720 --> 01:04:47.643
Making her disappear.

01:04:58.360 --> 01:04:59.521
How will I recognize him?

01:04:59.680 --> 01:05:01.921
He drives a Toronado.

01:05:03.520 --> 01:05:06.524
- The tourist.
- Yeah, he's no tourist.

01:06:26.760 --> 01:06:28.569
So, how are we gonna do this?

01:06:29.040 --> 01:06:30.485
Well, that's the easy part.

01:06:30.680 --> 01:06:32.648
You just put the money on the ground

01:06:32.840 --> 01:06:35.320
and then get in your car and fuck off.

01:06:38.720 --> 01:06:40.165
Not a chance.

01:06:40.800 --> 01:06:42.882
We do this face-to-face or not at all.

01:06:44.040 --> 01:06:45.930
You don't get to call the shots.

01:06:46.280 --> 01:06:47.964
You consider this a down payment.

01:06:48.120 --> 01:06:49.565
I'll keep the memory card

01:06:49.720 --> 01:06:51.688
until the insurance policy's cleared.

01:06:51.840 --> 01:06:53.205
Over my dead body.

01:06:54.680 --> 01:06:56.330
Isn't that over your wife's dead body?

01:06:56.480 --> 01:06:57.481
You go to hell!

01:06:57.640 --> 01:06:59.927
You've got a bad attitude.

01:07:00.880 --> 01:07:03.121
Look, your money is here,

01:07:03.280 --> 01:07:05.362
and so am I
until you come and collect it.

01:07:05.520 --> 01:07:07.602
Or I could just shoot you
where you stand,

01:07:07.760 --> 01:07:09.489
come and take the money.

01:07:09.640 --> 01:07:12.530
What, and kill the only person
that can claim the insurance policy?

01:07:14.200 --> 01:07:15.531
I don't think so.

01:07:18.360 --> 01:07:19.964
- Yes!
- Fuck!

01:07:36.200 --> 01:07:37.531
Fuck!

01:07:44.520 --> 01:07:47.888
You know, I'd prefer not to kill you.

01:07:50.120 --> 01:07:51.451
But I will.

01:07:52.040 --> 01:07:53.724
Just so we're clear.

01:07:54.960 --> 01:07:56.883
- This ends today.
- Whatever you say.

01:08:11.160 --> 01:08:12.205
God!

01:08:14.720 --> 01:08:16.563
Fuck!

01:08:30.399 --> 01:08:32.050
Do you find something funny?!

01:08:33.840 --> 01:08:35.763
You're a fucking lunatic! You know that?

01:08:38.200 --> 01:08:40.167
- Look in the bag.
- Why?

01:08:42.080 --> 01:08:43.923
'Cause I want to see your face.

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:00.729
That wife of yours.

01:09:02.479 --> 01:09:04.323
She's something, right?

01:09:06.827 --> 01:09:08.002
Leave her alone.

01:09:08.200 --> 01:09:12.363
Tell me where the fucking money
is or she eats this gun.

01:09:12.960 --> 01:09:14.121
If I tell you...

01:09:14.279 --> 01:09:15.645
Then I won't kill her.

01:09:16.920 --> 01:09:18.684
- Give me your word.
- I promise.

01:09:23.240 --> 01:09:25.491
It's in the boot.

01:09:29.439 --> 01:09:32.523
The keys are... in my pocket.

01:10:10.480 --> 01:10:11.891
- Now...
- Yeah?

01:10:12.640 --> 01:10:14.722
...I will be sure to tell your wife

01:10:14.880 --> 01:10:16.564
what you tried to do for her.

01:10:16.720 --> 01:10:18.484
You promised me.

01:10:19.341 --> 01:10:21.528
You promised...

01:10:36.200 --> 01:10:37.645
No.

01:10:40.400 --> 01:10:41.925
No!

01:12:26.640 --> 01:12:27.926
Jack?

01:12:36.360 --> 01:12:37.691
Jack?

01:12:41.040 --> 01:12:42.769
I could murder a drink.

01:12:53.800 --> 01:12:57.964
Despite how this looks,
I had nothing to do with it.

01:14:21.160 --> 01:14:25.563
Hey! Hey! Hey!

01:14:43.040 --> 01:14:44.121
Dylan!

01:17:38.280 --> 01:17:39.975
Boo!

01:17:41.200 --> 01:17:42.486
Fuck!

01:17:45.520 --> 01:17:47.329
What the fuck are you doing here?

01:17:48.720 --> 01:17:50.131
Dammit!

01:18:01.200 --> 01:18:03.009
What happened?

01:18:03.880 --> 01:18:05.325
He fucking stabbed me.

01:18:05.480 --> 01:18:07.084
What, Nathan?

01:18:07.280 --> 01:18:09.521
Yeah. What a complete psycho.

01:18:09.680 --> 01:18:11.409
- But you got the money?
- Oh, I got it.

01:18:11.560 --> 01:18:12.925
Where's Nathan now?

01:18:13.120 --> 01:18:14.770
Yeah, about that.

01:18:15.680 --> 01:18:18.126
What about it?

01:18:23.400 --> 01:18:25.164
Did you fuck this up?

01:18:25.520 --> 01:18:28.126
Honey, I'm having a bad day here.

01:18:28.680 --> 01:18:29.841
You killed him?

01:18:30.040 --> 01:18:31.121
He forced my hand.

01:18:31.280 --> 01:18:32.691
Do you realize what you've done?

01:18:32.840 --> 01:18:35.161
It was him or me, okay? Sorry.

01:18:35.320 --> 01:18:36.651
Dammit, Charlie!

01:18:37.200 --> 01:18:38.326
You wanted him dead.

01:18:38.560 --> 01:18:41.848
- Yeah, after the insurance settlement.
- What can I say? The guy flipped.

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:44.845
Un-fucking-believable. You had
a simple job and you fucked it up.

01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:47.926
Don't try to blame this on me.
You're the one who couldn't wait.

01:18:48.080 --> 01:18:50.686
You wanted the 250 now, so I sorted it.

01:18:50.840 --> 01:18:52.444
Sorted it?

01:18:52.600 --> 01:18:54.841
You weren't meant to kill him,
you idiot!

01:18:55.040 --> 01:18:56.405
Watch your mouth.

01:18:56.560 --> 01:18:59.161
How the fuck do we get the insurance
money without Nathan?

01:18:59.320 --> 01:19:01.402
Thanks to your incompetence,
our plan's utterly ruined.

01:19:01.560 --> 01:19:03.688
That's just great, Charlie.

01:19:05.760 --> 01:19:07.489
Your husband might have
put up with your shit.

01:19:07.640 --> 01:19:09.722
Don't mistake me for him.

01:19:10.960 --> 01:19:13.281
Well, I'd like to say
it's been a pleasure.

01:19:13.440 --> 01:19:14.566
What do you mean?

01:19:14.720 --> 01:19:16.324
I'm leaving.

01:19:17.560 --> 01:19:19.164
Yeah, I'm coming with you.

01:19:20.480 --> 01:19:23.404
- Not in this life.
- You can't just leave.

01:19:23.560 --> 01:19:25.449
What were you expecting?

01:19:27.520 --> 01:19:29.363
- But...
- What, because we fucked?

01:19:29.960 --> 01:19:31.724
Consider it a fringe benefit.

01:19:33.800 --> 01:19:35.689
We split the money first.

01:19:36.280 --> 01:19:37.884
No need to be greedy.

01:19:38.440 --> 01:19:40.522
You're about to inherit the hotel.

01:19:41.160 --> 01:19:42.764
What are you talking about?

01:19:42.960 --> 01:19:44.086
You'll see.

01:19:44.680 --> 01:19:45.920
I'll see what?

01:19:46.080 --> 01:19:47.445
So long, honey.

01:19:48.160 --> 01:19:49.525
- Give me the card!
- What?

01:19:49.720 --> 01:19:51.484
The card! The memory card
from the camera.

01:19:51.680 --> 01:19:53.170
Give it to me!

01:19:55.080 --> 01:19:58.411
You are either the craziest
or the cleverest bitch I have ever met.

01:19:58.800 --> 01:20:00.290
I can't decide.

01:20:09.760 --> 01:20:11.524
What the fuck?!

01:20:11.680 --> 01:20:13.205
Dylan, what are you doing here?

01:20:13.360 --> 01:20:14.771
I could ask you the same thing.

01:20:14.920 --> 01:20:18.129
God, this place is like a
fucking open-air insane asylum!

01:20:20.120 --> 01:20:21.963
- Is this what you did it for?
- Did what?

01:20:22.120 --> 01:20:24.282
Don't play dumb.
Jack filled me in on your deal.

01:20:24.440 --> 01:20:25.930
No, look, you've got it all wrong.

01:20:26.080 --> 01:20:28.560
- Don't fucking lie.
- I didn't touch her.

01:20:28.760 --> 01:20:31.889
He's lying. He did it. He killed Alice.

01:20:32.040 --> 01:20:33.565
You fucking snake!

01:20:33.760 --> 01:20:35.603
And he killed Nathan.

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:39.447
Look, if you want to know
who killed Alice, she did.

01:20:40.080 --> 01:20:41.605
Dylan, I swear to God...

01:20:41.760 --> 01:20:43.125
Look, I can prove it.

01:20:43.280 --> 01:20:45.442
- He's lying!
- Shut the fuck up!

01:20:49.520 --> 01:20:51.045
I know you killed her.

01:20:51.240 --> 01:20:53.083
She's dead, and so are you.

01:20:58.284 --> 01:20:59.845
Nice shot!

01:21:00.977 --> 01:21:02.491
I...

01:21:20.400 --> 01:21:21.845
Fuck's sake.

01:21:27.880 --> 01:21:29.370
Time we put you out of your misery.

01:21:35.960 --> 01:21:38.645
No, no! No! No!

01:22:14.760 --> 01:22:16.364
I took the money.

01:22:16.520 --> 01:22:17.965
I know.

01:22:30.280 --> 01:22:31.611
What?

01:23:34.040 --> 01:23:35.326
Yeah?

01:23:37.400 --> 01:23:38.925
I'll be there in an hour.

01:23:43.200 --> 01:23:44.690
Better make that two.

01:23:46.720 --> 01:23:48.370
