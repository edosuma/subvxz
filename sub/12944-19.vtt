10:12.166 --> 10:14.333
Hey, that's a great idea, Lanny.

10:14.400 --> 10:17.066
We'll play odds and percentages
at school.

10:17.133 --> 10:19.133
But with other people's candy.

10:19.200 --> 10:21.266
[CHUCKLES] Sweet.

10:26.533 --> 10:29.467
This is the longest I've ever gone
without talking to Gordo,

10:29.533 --> 10:32.367
since he deliberately smushed
my brownie in the third grade.

10:32.433 --> 10:34.233
How long did your fight last then?

10:34.300 --> 10:35.767
Till the bus ride home.

10:35.834 --> 10:38.400
Well, maybe this is what happens
when your best friend's a boy.

10:38.467 --> 10:39.800
Things get complicated.

10:40.500 --> 10:41.967
I guess I just miss him.

10:42.066 --> 10:43.433
You can try talking to him.

10:43.600 --> 10:46.100
I hear he waits for Brooke
at her locker between classes.

10:46.166 --> 10:48.033
Gordo waits at her locker?

10:48.100 --> 10:50.100
He's in a relationship now.

10:50.233 --> 10:51.467
It's sort of required.

10:51.533 --> 10:53.066
Tomorrow night? Coolie.

10:53.166 --> 10:55.133
But first I have to help Brooke
get ready for her hot date.

10:55.200 --> 10:57.734
It's at the Holy Rigatoni.
Isn't that romantic?

10:58.100 --> 10:59.266
Hot date?

10:59.433 --> 11:00.867
Gordo's her boyfriend.

11:00.934 --> 11:02.767
Wrap your mind around it.

11:02.834 --> 11:05.767
Hot date and Gordo are never used
in the same sentence.

11:05.834 --> 11:07.767
Especially by Claire.

11:08.100 --> 11:10.133
Brooke's date is obviously
with someone else.

11:10.200 --> 11:12.800
So, Gordo, I'm really sorry
about what I said

11:12.867 --> 11:15.333
and I've decided to be totally
supportive of you and Brooke.

11:15.400 --> 11:17.300
-You have?
-Yes,

11:17.367 --> 11:19.367
because it seems
you really like each other

11:19.433 --> 11:22.600
and I'm sure when you two
are together, it's very

11:22.667 --> 11:24.166
-cool.
-Only, not cool.

11:24.467 --> 11:26.367
More on the warmer side?

11:26.467 --> 11:28.433
Even warmer than warm

11:28.500 --> 11:31.433
What's warmer than warm?
What are you guys talking about?

11:31.500 --> 11:33.734
David, hurry!
We're gonna be late for science.

11:33.834 --> 11:35.266
Mmm, I gotta go.

11:36.367 --> 11:37.967
There, you happy now?

11:38.033 --> 11:40.000
No, Miranda, I'm not.

11:40.066 --> 11:42.533
Gordo had no clue
about this "hot date".

11:42.600 --> 11:45.800
Well, I wouldn't either with the way
that conversation was going.

11:45.867 --> 11:49.033
[SIGHS] I was right,
Brooke is two-timing Gordo.

11:49.133 --> 11:51.133
This is gonna totally destroy him.

11:51.200 --> 11:53.934
Lizzie, unless you actually
go to the Holy Rigatoni,

11:54.000 --> 11:56.066
spy on Brooke,
and get pictures of her date,

11:56.133 --> 11:57.533
then you have nothing.

11:57.600 --> 12:00.967
That's it! We'll spy,
we'll do it for Gordo [SQUEALS]

12:01.000 --> 12:02.734
Brilliant idea, Miranda. Yay!

12:02.800 --> 12:04.500
Uh, that's not what I meant

12:04.567 --> 12:06.600
and we are not spying.

12:06.667 --> 12:07.967
Yes, we are. Come on.

12:12.967 --> 12:14.800
Come on, Miranda.

12:16.767 --> 12:19.367
Why am I the one dressed like a boy?

12:19.767 --> 12:21.200
'Cause your voice is deeper.

12:21.266 --> 12:23.433
Besides, you know, this was your idea.

12:23.500 --> 12:24.633
No, it wasn't.

12:24.700 --> 12:26.800
And I'm having a really big problem,
Lizzie.

12:26.900 --> 12:28.367
I have to go to the bathroom.

12:28.600 --> 12:31.066

-Yeah, which one?

Wait, he's getting up.

12:44.166 --> 12:45.800
-Who?
-Her date.

He's going to the men's room.
Go follow him.

12:49.734 --> 12:50.767
In there?

12:50.834 --> 12:53.333
You said you had to go,
so go.

12:53.400 --> 12:57.000
I can't go in there. They have those
weird fountain thingies on the wall.

And I also can't believe
that you guys spied on me.

19:38.300 --> 19:40.700
-You just said that, Gordo.
-I know.

19:41.300 --> 19:44.333
On the one hand, I'm really insulted.
But on the other,

19:45.200 --> 19:48.200
I realize that you guys did it
because you care a lot about me.

19:49.266 --> 19:50.934
Yeah, that's the one.

19:51.133 --> 19:53.767
Well, for your information,
Brooke and I broke up.

19:54.367 --> 19:55.367
What?

19:55.533 --> 19:57.433
Is it because of what we did
last night?

19:57.734 --> 20:00.734
Gordo, I'm really sorry.
A-And you've got to get her back.

20:01.533 --> 20:03.467
If she won't listen to you,
I'll try talking to--

20:03.533 --> 20:05.667
Wait, wait, I broke up with her.

20:06.100 --> 20:08.300
In a lot of ways,
Brooke's really great.

20:08.367 --> 20:10.300
-She's smart.
-Told you.

20:10.367 --> 20:13.033
She smells good,
she's easy to be around.

20:13.100 --> 20:14.300
So, what's the problem?

20:15.100 --> 20:16.500
It's kinda conceptual.

20:16.967 --> 20:19.667
But, I guess, I just like the idea
of having a girlfriend

20:19.767 --> 20:21.700
a lot better than
I actually having one.

20:21.967 --> 20:23.800
Yep, he's back.

20:23.867 --> 20:25.500
Look, the kissing was cool,

20:25.567 --> 20:27.700
and getting notes was kinda fun.

20:27.767 --> 20:29.834
I'm just not ready
for that kind of commitment.

20:30.066 --> 20:31.834
I had to wait for her by her locker,

20:31.900 --> 20:33.433
I had to pay for her lunches,

20:33.500 --> 20:35.367
I had no time for myself anymore.

20:35.867 --> 20:38.600
-Bummer.
-I also had no time for you guys.

20:39.100 --> 20:40.333
I really missed that part.

20:40.600 --> 20:42.500
[CHUCKLES] So did we.

20:42.700 --> 20:43.967
I knew he'd come back.

20:44.467 --> 20:46.600
-They always do.

20:47.200 --> 20:50.100
So, uh, interesting wardrobe choice
last night, Miranda.

20:50.333 --> 20:52.800
Oh, I'm sorry,
I-I should say, Mirando.

20:52.967 --> 20:54.967
-[LAUGHS]
-Ugh! I said it once

20:55.000 --> 20:58.433
and I'll say it again,
it wasn't my idea.

20:59.567 --> 21:02.100
So, Gordo, one thing
that you haven't told us.

21:02.166 --> 21:04.200
-What?
-How was the lip-lock?

21:04.266 --> 21:06.333
I'm sorry,
I-I don't kiss and tell.

21:06.600 --> 21:08.567
-[BOTH SCOFF]
-Come on, spill.

21:08.633 --> 21:10.834
-I'm not gonna do it.
-Dish, dude.

I'm getting a hole in my thing.

-Defective gloves? [LAUGHS]
-What if it leaks through?
