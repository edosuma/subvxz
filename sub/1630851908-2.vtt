00:15.933 --> 00:17.685
[knocking]

00:18.728 --> 00:19.812
- Hey. What's up?
- Hi.

00:19.854 --> 00:20.980
- How's it going?
- Good.

00:21.021 --> 00:23.023
- Just chilling.

00:25.192 --> 00:26.986
[Mack]: Love that.

00:27.027 --> 00:28.362
I was thinking.

00:28.404 --> 00:31.991
We would just like talk
and like catch up.

00:32.032 --> 00:33.492
So when it comes to like
a group of friends.

00:33.534 --> 00:35.828
I think especially
like lesbians...

00:35.870 --> 00:37.288
...there's always drama.

00:37.329 --> 00:39.623
The Y2K party was lit.
It was a good time.

00:39.665 --> 00:42.001
But towards the end it got
really like crazy.

00:42.042 --> 00:44.837
So I feel like I'd rather
just talk about it.

00:44.879 --> 00:46.589
The battle of the couples...

00:46.630 --> 00:48.299
...it was a little much.

00:48.340 --> 00:49.759
The party was, I loved it.

00:49.800 --> 00:51.552
I feel like it
was a really good time.

00:51.594 --> 00:54.138
But I feel like there was a
point at the end of the night,

00:54.180 --> 00:55.723
everything kind
of like changed.

00:55.765 --> 00:57.558
They were chugging
from a Rumplemintz bottle...

00:57.600 --> 00:59.560
- ...and then they flipped out.
- Yeah

00:59.602 --> 01:00.978
- We were all actually
chilling I thought we were

01:01.020 --> 01:01.979
- having a good conversation
- It was so...

01:02.021 --> 01:03.230
- I thought we were cool.

01:03.272 --> 01:04.648
[Haley]: It was really
like honestly...

01:04.690 --> 01:06.108
- it was spontaneous.
- It was out of the blue.

01:06.150 --> 01:07.151
[Mack]: It was so petty,
it was so childish.

01:07.193 --> 01:08.569
I thought it was very weird.

01:08.611 --> 01:10.154
[Haley]: Summer and Marissa...

01:10.196 --> 01:11.906
...have only been to our house
like a few times.

01:11.947 --> 01:15.201
I tried for like a while to
get them to come to our parties.

01:15.242 --> 01:18.287
- Woo!
- Damn, I need a drink.

01:18.329 --> 01:20.039
[Brianna]: I feel like everyone
was having an awesome time.

01:20.080 --> 01:21.081
We were having some drinks.

01:21.123 --> 01:23.209
[Cuppie]: Rumpies.

01:23.250 --> 01:25.461
[Brianna]: And all of a sudden
I hear Summer trying to get

01:25.503 --> 01:28.172
everybody to fucking leave
and go somewhere else.

01:28.214 --> 01:29.173
[Summer]: Let's go out.

01:29.215 --> 01:30.674
You wanna go get a drink?

01:30.716 --> 01:32.343
[Cuppie]: Go out where?

01:32.384 --> 01:34.470
- White Lie, asshole.
- White Lie.

01:34.512 --> 01:36.013
I'm very heavy.

01:36.055 --> 01:38.307
Bye y'all.

01:38.349 --> 01:40.059
- Okay, adios amigos.

01:40.100 --> 01:42.728
[Brianna]: Once we kinda
realized that what was
transpiring

01:42.770 --> 01:45.481
is that everybody was heading
to the bar after all of that,

01:45.523 --> 01:47.733
you know, herding
of the people.

01:47.775 --> 01:49.193
I went outside and I saw

01:49.235 --> 01:51.111
like half the party out
in the driveway.

01:51.153 --> 01:53.656
[Jordan]: Everybody!
An Uber XL...

01:53.697 --> 01:55.366
Is six people.

01:55.407 --> 01:56.367
[Brianna]: I'm like, "Well what
the fuck is at the bar?"

01:56.408 --> 01:58.077
"What am I missing?"

01:58.118 --> 01:59.620
[Brianna]: Marissa, don't make
the mistake of driving

01:59.662 --> 02:00.996
with, like, a drink in your
system.

02:01.038 --> 02:02.623
- Oh, my god.
[Summer] She didn't fucking
drink!

02:02.665 --> 02:03.874
[Marissa]: I didn't go and get
fucking thrashed.

02:03.916 --> 02:05.251
[Summer]: Back off.

02:05.292 --> 02:07.253
[Brianna]: She just started
going off on me.

02:07.294 --> 02:08.546
When you're having a party and
you're putting in all that work.

02:08.587 --> 02:10.339
And then somebody
just comes in

02:10.381 --> 02:12.383
and they're like "Alright guys,
let's all go to the bar."

02:12.424 --> 02:13.968
You know,
it's just kind of rude.

02:14.009 --> 02:15.719
Summer and Marissa were
sitting right here on the thing.

02:15.761 --> 02:19.098
And Summer was laughing and
like having us like fucking pour

02:19.139 --> 02:21.016
shots in her mouth and was
having a grand old time.

02:21.058 --> 02:23.269
Then 30 minutes later she's
flipping out and screaming.

02:23.310 --> 02:26.564
I need to leave, I need to go
to the bar, like, I don't know.

02:26.605 --> 02:29.024
- I mean I know you guys
heard about the car ride.

02:29.066 --> 02:30.734
- Obviously.
- Yeah.

02:30.776 --> 02:33.070
[Mack]: We get in the Uber,
Summer is yelling in my ear.

02:33.112 --> 02:37.116
Shiva's in the backseat
recording without telling me.

02:37.157 --> 02:38.325
[Mack]: You want me to shut the
fuck up

02:38.367 --> 02:39.535
and not say
nothing back?

02:39.535 --> 02:41.120
[Mack]: You have gotten very
hostile.

02:41.161 --> 02:42.830
[Cuppie]: It's not hostile
at you.

02:42.872 --> 02:44.707
[Mack]: So I feel like right
now, right now...

02:44.748 --> 02:46.083
[Mack]: I haven't disrespected
nobody.

02:46.166 --> 02:47.751
[Mack]: I haven't
crossed a line

02:47.793 --> 02:49.295
[Summer]: Will you shut the
fuck up for one sec?

02:51.088 --> 02:53.924
- I don't know, I feel like
Shiva in that situation...

02:53.966 --> 02:57.344
it was weird that
she recorded me

02:57.386 --> 03:00.723
and didn't tell me. I had
to find out from other people.

03:00.764 --> 03:02.391
- But only recorded you
and didn't record all that shit

03:02.433 --> 03:03.934
- from all of them.
- Didn't record anyone else.

03:03.976 --> 03:05.769
- That's kinda fucked...
or maybe she clipped it.

03:05.811 --> 03:08.480
So that fact that Shiva
only recorded the part of the

03:08.522 --> 03:12.067
conversation where I was like
pretty much defending myself,

03:12.109 --> 03:16.822
and then sends it to Jordan,
who wasn't even there.

03:16.864 --> 03:19.116
I don't need to spell out
what the intentions were.

03:19.158 --> 03:21.368
But they were,
they weren't pure.

03:21.410 --> 03:25.039
And they weren't genuine
so, who does that?

03:25.080 --> 03:29.168
Summer was really upset, by
that point I was just like...

03:29.209 --> 03:31.003
Okay I don't even know
what you're mad about.

03:31.045 --> 03:32.796
She's mad she drove
to our house to come to a party

03:32.838 --> 03:34.590
that she wanted to come to?

03:34.632 --> 03:36.175
- Sorry.
- She's upset.

03:36.216 --> 03:37.843
[Haley]: Then all of a sudden
it was too far for her.

03:37.885 --> 03:39.595
- Sorry you drove here, chugged
Rumplemintz and then decided

03:39.637 --> 03:42.640
you wanted to leave so bad and
go to a fucking bar.

03:44.224 --> 03:46.560
- Hello, hello.
- Hi.

03:46.602 --> 03:48.395
- Hey guys?
- What's up?

03:48.437 --> 03:49.438
- What's up man?

03:49.480 --> 03:50.856
- How do you guys feel?

03:50.898 --> 03:52.066
- I don't know.
- I'm still recovering.

03:52.107 --> 03:53.317
- Honestly, like,
we were like

03:53.359 --> 03:55.194
wondering how it
was gonna go down but...

03:55.235 --> 03:57.446
Bri literally got
in your guys' face.

03:57.488 --> 04:00.366
[Summer]: Every time something
happens between the four of us,

04:00.407 --> 04:02.785
Haley always wants to defend
Murphy and come at me.

04:02.826 --> 04:04.495
Don't know why. Look.

04:04.536 --> 04:06.288
- This is Haley, or?
- Yeah, this is from Haley.

04:06.330 --> 04:08.374
Whom I hadn't even
spoken to that night.

04:08.415 --> 04:10.417
I actually, the last thing I
said to her when I left is

04:10.459 --> 04:11.961
"Thank you so much
for having us."

04:12.002 --> 04:13.379
[Jordan]: "Brianna was just
looking out for you guys

04:13.420 --> 04:15.589
as friends. Clearly you both
feel otherwise

04:15.631 --> 04:17.633
and have a lot of fake shit
to say to our face.

04:17.675 --> 04:19.635
And a lot of other things
to say behind our back.

04:19.677 --> 04:21.637
Run like you
always do, fake as fuck."

04:21.679 --> 04:24.640
♪♪

04:24.682 --> 04:26.517
[Haley]: So after I texted
Summer and Marissa,

04:26.558 --> 04:28.727
all of a sudden like,
maybe 30 minutes later.

04:28.769 --> 04:32.481
She, Marissa, texts
Brianna and she's like,

04:32.523 --> 04:34.984
"You better get your bitch
before I tell her why

04:35.025 --> 04:36.402
Summer doesn't fuck with you!"

04:36.443 --> 04:37.945
[Brianna]: Anymore, yeah.
What does that mean?

04:37.987 --> 04:39.029
I said "What the fuck are you
talking about?"

04:39.029 --> 04:40.531
[Haley]: Yeah, I would love
to know.

04:40.572 --> 04:42.366
- Between me and them
she had nothing to say

04:42.408 --> 04:44.201
So they're clearly trying to
make some shit up at this point.

04:44.243 --> 04:45.327
- She's trying to act
like there's something sinister.

04:45.369 --> 04:47.037
- Wait, wait.
- Going on.

04:47.079 --> 04:49.039
"You better get a hold
of you're bitch, before I tell

04:49.081 --> 04:50.749
her why Summer does
not fuck with you!"

04:50.791 --> 04:52.710
And she said, "What the fuck
you talking about?"

04:52.751 --> 04:54.378
and I said, "Nothing."

04:54.420 --> 04:56.922
Because I want you to sit and
brew and think about

04:56.964 --> 04:58.590
all the times that
you grabbed her ass.

04:58.632 --> 04:59.842
I hope she's smart enough
to think about

04:59.883 --> 05:01.552
what I'm talking about.

05:01.593 --> 05:04.179
- So I don't like Murphy.
I don't care for Murphy.

05:04.221 --> 05:08.892
She hits on me and grabs me
around the waist and shit

05:08.934 --> 05:10.686
every single time
I'm out with her.

05:10.728 --> 05:13.147
- Although, I'm livid
that fucking Bri has done that,

05:13.188 --> 05:15.065
- Uh, I don't wanna...
- It just wasn't even...

05:15.107 --> 05:16.817
- Haley is a nice girl and...
- They're not worth it.

05:16.859 --> 05:18.485
I don't wanna do it...
Exactly, it's not worth it,

05:18.527 --> 05:21.697
and not the first time we
fucking heard that story.

05:21.739 --> 05:24.074
There's not a really
good reputation surrounding

05:24.116 --> 05:25.826
Haley and Brianna's
relationship.

05:25.868 --> 05:29.872
I know a lot of people in
Tampa aren't huge fans of them.

05:29.913 --> 05:32.666
And I'm somebody where I kinda
just keep my distance.

05:32.708 --> 05:35.252
And you're a party friend, you
know, your relationship

05:35.294 --> 05:38.672
isn't really going to affect me.
But I do know that...

05:38.714 --> 05:41.592
There are talks, I have
personally seen and witnessed

05:41.633 --> 05:47.264
things and heard things that,
um aren't... exactly loyal.

05:47.306 --> 05:49.058
- Wasn't she crying
to you about the fact that

05:49.099 --> 05:50.392
everybody thinks they're
in an open relationship?

05:50.434 --> 05:52.102
'Cause that makes
perfect sense.

05:52.144 --> 05:53.604
- I just wonder what their
relationship really is like

05:53.645 --> 05:54.980
behind closed doors.

05:55.022 --> 05:56.356
[Summer]: I never have even
seen them kiss.

05:56.398 --> 05:58.108
I mean I haven't been around
them, I really don't...

05:58.150 --> 05:59.401
Exactly have you ever seen them
be affectionate with each other?

05:59.443 --> 06:00.652
- I've known them
for four years.

06:00.694 --> 06:02.279
- Have you ever seen
them kiss once?

06:02.321 --> 06:03.781
I've known them for
four years, I've...

06:03.822 --> 06:04.782
now that you say that,
I've legitimately

06:04.823 --> 06:06.575
never seen them kiss.

06:06.617 --> 06:08.535
- It's like a business
relationship. It's weird.

06:08.577 --> 06:10.287
- I don't know. I wanna know why
Summer doesn't fuck with you.

06:10.329 --> 06:11.455
- It really makes no sense.
- I wanna know why, honestly.

06:11.497 --> 06:13.040
- In my opinion.
- Yeah, me too.

06:13.082 --> 06:14.208
- She's just trying to act
like there's

06:14.249 --> 06:16.376
an underlying, like, secret.

06:16.418 --> 06:18.962
[Marissa]: So where do you go
from, where do you go from here?

06:27.471 --> 06:29.473
♪♪

06:37.147 --> 06:38.816
- Hey.
- Hi.

06:38.857 --> 06:40.275
- What'd you bring me?

06:40.317 --> 06:42.027
- Do you want coffee,
or do you want alcohol?

06:42.069 --> 06:44.071
[laughter]

06:45.989 --> 06:46.949
Which one?

06:46.990 --> 06:48.075
- I guess maybe coffee.

06:48.117 --> 06:49.660
- What are you
working on?

06:49.701 --> 06:51.370
One of the pieces for
the show I told you I was doing.

06:51.411 --> 06:53.372
- Shit, that's awesome.
- Thank you.

06:53.413 --> 06:54.915
- How many more pieces
do you have for that

06:54.957 --> 06:56.500
show to work on?

06:56.542 --> 06:57.584
- I'm going to try and
do about three more.

06:59.002 --> 07:01.630
I met Olivia,
last Cinco De Mayo.

07:01.672 --> 07:04.633
We got really, really
close instantaneously.

07:04.675 --> 07:06.718
I just got out of
a relationship.

07:06.760 --> 07:09.847
She just got out of like a
seven year long relationship.

07:09.888 --> 07:12.141
So we both really bonded.

07:12.182 --> 07:14.268
I think when she started
finding herself, and

07:14.309 --> 07:16.061
she was like oh my God,
I can have all this fun,

07:16.103 --> 07:18.021
like I'm allowed
to do these things.

07:18.063 --> 07:21.483
Alcohol is so great,
she took full advantage.

07:21.525 --> 07:24.111
- Are you ready to take a break,
'cause I'm a little hungover.

07:24.153 --> 07:25.737
I'm a little starving.

07:25.779 --> 07:28.198
- Yeah, honestly I could
really, I could really use food.

07:28.240 --> 07:30.450
- I got you a bagel.
- I love you!

07:30.492 --> 07:32.744
- I'm a very thoughtful
best friend.

07:32.786 --> 07:36.874
Olivia is very fun,
wild, passionate.

07:36.915 --> 07:39.001
Very loving and protective.

07:39.042 --> 07:41.420
And I love
everything about her.

07:41.461 --> 07:43.755
- So, alcohol is later right?

07:43.797 --> 07:45.632
I guess it's later.

07:45.674 --> 07:47.176
- I haven't seen
you a lot lately.

07:47.217 --> 07:49.303
- What have you been up to?
- Elly is like what did,

07:49.344 --> 07:50.304
what did Auntie Olivia
bring me?

07:50.345 --> 07:51.680
- Sorry Elly.

07:51.722 --> 07:53.056
- Honestly, just really
like focusing on myself.

07:53.098 --> 07:54.808
- Yeah?

07:54.850 --> 07:57.436
Trying to get all my art
together, I feel like the next

07:57.477 --> 07:59.229
couple of months are going
to be really crazy for me.

07:59.271 --> 08:01.273
I feel like you haven't
been hanging out as much lately.

08:01.315 --> 08:03.609

drink!

to go fuck themselves.

30:26.659 --> 30:28.536
They also have a past,
they also have a history.

30:28.577 --> 30:30.079
There's a lot of things
stemming from that.

30:30.120 --> 30:31.580
Summer and Marissa
came to the party because

30:31.622 --> 30:33.249
it was our birthday and they're
my best friends.

30:33.290 --> 30:34.917
Right.

30:34.959 --> 30:36.585
Obviously, you know,
thankful to Brianna and Haley

30:36.627 --> 30:38.963
for having that whole
thing, 100 percent,

30:39.004 --> 30:41.173
but I think everything that
happened at the end of the night

30:41.215 --> 30:43.926
was because of the history.

30:43.968 --> 30:47.304
In Tampa there
is some competing.

30:47.346 --> 30:50.683
There's a culture of
"Who knows who?"

30:50.724 --> 30:52.726
"Who's the cutest couple?"

30:52.768 --> 30:55.521
"Who's the most successful?"
and it's really exhausting.

30:55.563 --> 30:58.649
But I know Summer and Marissa
definitely are not threatened

30:58.691 --> 31:00.150
by Brianna and Haley.

31:00.192 --> 31:02.152
It sucks, it sucks that,
you know,

31:02.194 --> 31:04.029

night in a different way

31:04.071 --> 31:05.155
and actually all gone out
to Ybor and have

31:05.197 --> 31:06.824
- a good time.
- Yeah.

31:06.865 --> 31:09.785
Now we have like this
group of friends that divides

31:09.827 --> 31:12.580
into friends that are closest
to Summer and Marissa.

31:12.621 --> 31:14.790
Then friends, that are obviously
like myself,

31:14.832 --> 31:16.959
who have been close
with Brianna and Haley.

31:17.001 --> 31:20.796
It definitely causes unnecessary
issues and problems.

31:20.838 --> 31:22.006

to pick sides

31:22.047 --> 31:23.424

31:23.465 --> 31:25.551

31:25.593 --> 31:27.344
and whether it benefited me or
not,

31:27.386 --> 31:30.180
I'm clearing the air,
because it was unnecessary

31:30.222 --> 31:32.850
and I again was
not trying to fight.

31:32.891 --> 31:35.686
I was just like,
"We're, we're in a car."

31:35.728 --> 31:37.146

a little bit.

31:37.187 --> 31:38.731

like, out of your name

Yo, like I'm sorry man.

of our conversation.

look bad with that video

- Why not the whole thing?

38:24.553 --> 38:26.304

Shiva's intentions were

with the recording
of Mack in the car.

I know Mack was
super upset about it,

38:32.728 --> 38:35.564
and felt like, deceived
because it just seemed very odd

38:35.605 --> 38:37.149
that she would only record
half the conversation.

38:37.190 --> 38:38.859
- Sketchy.
- Yeah.

38:38.900 --> 38:41.319
I mean know you guys heard
about the car ride.

38:41.361 --> 38:44.156
After the Y2K party, Shiva in
that situation,

38:44.197 --> 38:47.659
it was weird that
she recorded me.

38:47.701 --> 38:49.870
- But only recorded you and
didn't record all that shit from

38:49.911 --> 38:51.413
- Didn't record anyone else.
- all of them.That's kinda
fucked.

38:51.455 --> 38:52.581
Or maybe she clipped it.

38:52.622 --> 38:54.249
Obviously Mack
had our backs,

38:54.291 --> 38:56.752
so we're gonna have her
back in the situation.

38:56.793 --> 38:59.129
But, like,
but the thing is if I really did

38:59.171 --> 39:02.174
have malicious intent with the
video, people would know that.

39:02.215 --> 39:04.801
Because I would have sent it
to someone, saying like,

39:04.843 --> 39:07.345
"She's such a bitch."
Or whatever, but I didn't.

39:07.387 --> 39:09.306
I only sent it to her so...

39:09.347 --> 39:10.724
I didn't hear the video, because
she wouldn't play it for me.

39:10.766 --> 39:12.601
- You want me to play it?
- I heard it.

39:12.642 --> 39:14.269
- Actually I don't want to.
- You can play it if you want.

39:14.311 --> 39:15.771
- You could do whatever
you want, it's your video.

39:15.812 --> 39:17.314
I'm not really sure
why Bri and Haley

39:17.355 --> 39:19.316
want me to play that video.

39:19.357 --> 39:23.570
Unfortunately, I think there's
still some hard feelings

39:23.612 --> 39:27.741
from the Y2K party that
got brought onto the boat.

39:27.783 --> 39:29.618
But me and Mack are cool.

39:29.659 --> 39:31.495
Like, you know, this is
just a misunderstanding.

39:31.536 --> 39:33.205
So I play it for them.

39:33.246 --> 39:34.915
[Mack]: You don't know me and
I don't know you

39:34.956 --> 39:36.374

39:36.416 --> 39:38.001

- Who, who are we talking to?
- Shh.

39:39.711 --> 39:41.421
- That's Sarah.
- [Mack]: And when I say you
have been very hostile...

39:41.463 --> 39:44.549
...and that's just because
my energy is very chill.

Pff. She's a chill person?
Bruh.

39:50.972 --> 39:53.183
- I wouldn't be ashamed of
that video at all. Honestly,

39:53.225 --> 39:54.726
If I was Sarah.

39:54.768 --> 39:56.394
Mack is like one person
that always has my back

39:56.436 --> 39:57.938
and her back and we put
on a party for you guys,

39:57.979 --> 39:59.815
and the night should
have been about you guys,

39:59.856 --> 40:02.025
and they were like, "Let's go,
we're going to the bar."

40:02.067 --> 40:03.360
[Summer]: Let's go out.

40:03.401 --> 40:04.444
You wanna go get a drink?

40:04.486 --> 40:06.238

40:06.279 --> 40:07.823
Okay, adios amigos.

40:07.864 --> 40:09.866
[Cuppie]: Do you want to go out
drinking with us?

40:09.908 --> 40:12.744
[Brianna]: No. I want everybody
to go fuck themselves.

40:12.786 --> 40:13.912
And I feel like that was
almost disrespectful

40:13.954 --> 40:15.705
and a slap to the face to us.

40:15.747 --> 40:17.415
- Summer was screaming in
the car, if you have something

40:17.457 --> 40:18.959
to say, like you shouldn't
be screaming in a car

40:19.000 --> 40:20.836
full of people who barely
know you like that.

40:20.877 --> 40:22.671
Say it to our faces.

40:22.712 --> 40:24.631
- Okay, so this isn't about
me and Sarah anymore?

40:24.673 --> 40:26.383
- [both]: No, it's not.
- Ah, okay.

40:26.424 --> 40:29.010
We basically just moved
on from that conversation

40:29.052 --> 40:32.764
because it's not really my place
to, you know, dig any further.

40:32.806 --> 40:36.268
[Brianna]: Shiva, she's
definitely a little pot stirrer.

40:38.478 --> 40:40.230
- You guys are messy as hell.

40:40.272 --> 40:41.648
- We try to have a nice day,
take you guys out on the boat

40:41.690 --> 40:42.816
and look at you now.

are you guys

40:49.156 --> 40:51.658

40:51.700 --> 40:53.577
- Tie what knot?

40:53.618 --> 40:55.579
- Oh shit.

40:55.620 --> 40:57.831
Brianna, she hates when
people ask about that.

40:57.873 --> 41:00.500
Marriage is really important
to me, but I think that

41:00.542 --> 41:04.462
Brianna might have like, a fear
of getting married.

41:04.504 --> 41:06.882
- I'm gonna sit my...
- I think we're in a good place

41:06.923 --> 41:09.843
and I think everybody
else is in these like

41:09.885 --> 41:11.720
temporary relationships
and I feel like like,

41:11.761 --> 41:14.556
why fuck it up with something
that's like so societally,

41:14.598 --> 41:17.851
like demanded in a way. And I
feel like...

41:17.893 --> 41:19.811
[Jordan]: Haley, you kind of
look like you got a different
opinion on this.

41:19.853 --> 41:21.188
- I do.
- So, we'll do it when

41:21.229 --> 41:22.647
- we're ready to do it.
- What!

41:22.689 --> 41:25.650
- Brianna doesn't believe
in marriage.

41:25.692 --> 41:28.778
- What?
- Yeah.

41:28.820 --> 41:30.405
- So, how long have you
guys been together?

41:30.447 --> 41:31.823
- Six years.
- Six years.

41:31.865 --> 41:33.241
- That's not...

41:33.283 --> 41:35.202
- That is 49 years
in lesbian years.

41:35.243 --> 41:36.578
- I'm different than
other people.

41:36.620 --> 41:37.829
I'm built different.

41:37.871 --> 41:39.956
- So you guys are never
getting married?

41:39.998 --> 41:41.416
- It's not that I don't wanna
get married.

41:41.458 --> 41:43.001
- Don't be popping off.

41:43.043 --> 41:44.586
- It's not
that I don't wanna get married.

41:44.628 --> 41:46.671
I love my girl. I have a better,
stronger relationship than

41:46.713 --> 41:49.299
any lesbian I've ever met
and honestly more than any

41:49.341 --> 41:50.675

This is my best friend.

41:50.717 --> 41:52.302
- I get it.

41:52.344 --> 41:55.263
- When I heard that
Shiva had been recording Mack

41:55.305 --> 41:58.892
in the car, I was wondering
what are her intentions.

41:58.934 --> 42:00.685
Like recording someone without
their knowledge in general

42:00.727 --> 42:03.897
is super shady and then she
comes up and is asking me

42:03.939 --> 42:05.774
about marriage, I just feel
like it's not her place

42:05.815 --> 42:07.984
especially after everything
that transpired.

42:08.026 --> 42:09.861
Like none of
your fucking business.

42:09.903 --> 42:11.821
I don't need anybody
trying to come for me.

42:11.863 --> 42:12.948
What's gonna come out of
my mouth

42:12.989 --> 42:14.199
is gonna come out of
my mouth and

42:14.241 --> 42:15.784
nobody is gonna
try to come for me,

42:15.825 --> 42:16.993
- or else I'm gonna go ten-fold.
- Whoa. Whoa.

42:17.035 --> 42:17.994
[Shiva]: Why are you getting
so upset?

42:18.036 --> 42:19.496
Why are you saying that?

42:19.537 --> 42:20.747
- I'm not upset, why are
you always trying to get

42:20.789 --> 42:22.374
a reaction from everybody
around you?

42:24.459 --> 42:25.502
- All right.
- Me?

42:25.543 --> 42:26.836
- Yeah, I'm talking to you.

42:26.878 --> 42:29.256
I'm talking to Shiva
direct, actually.

42:29.297 --> 42:30.966
- Can you give me an example?

42:31.007 --> 42:32.884
Uh, that you're always
try to jump on any argument

42:32.926 --> 42:34.469
you possibly could to try
to get clout.

42:35.470 --> 42:39.474
[overlapping chattering]

42:40.517 --> 42:42.352
- I'm not, I'm good.

42:42.394 --> 42:45.605
Honestly if somebody's going to
disrespect me or my relationship

42:45.647 --> 42:47.941
and be questioning me
or my friends,

42:47.983 --> 42:49.651
I feel like it's not
anybody's place,

42:49.693 --> 42:50.777
so if they have
a problem with me,

42:50.819 --> 42:52.404
I'm gonna give them the wrath.

42:52.445 --> 42:53.571
If they don't like it,
they can just fuck off.

42:55.740 --> 42:58.743
Don't fucking question me,
because you're literally a joke.

42:58.785 --> 43:00.328
I just don't get why
you're saying that right now.

43:00.370 --> 43:02.080
- Don't question me.

43:02.122 --> 43:04.833
- I've known Haley and
Brianna for quite a while now

43:04.874 --> 43:07.836
and I wasn't trying to upset her
with the question.

43:07.877 --> 43:10.380
It was just a genuine,
like question.

43:10.422 --> 43:12.215
- I asked a marriage
question because honestly...

43:12.257 --> 43:13.925
Dude, what the fuck
are you talking about?

43:13.967 --> 43:15.552
Marriage? You will never be
married because you can't

43:15.593 --> 43:17.554
keep a girl for
five fucking seconds.

43:17.595 --> 43:18.972
- I don't know what's going on.

43:19.014 --> 43:23.018
I can't calm this
down right now.

43:23.059 --> 43:25.228
I'm in the crossfire.

43:25.270 --> 43:27.105
You want a fucking reaction?
You're about to fucking get it.

43:27.147 --> 43:28.773
I don't want a reaction.

43:28.815 --> 43:29.983
- Good. Then fucking
stop talking shit to everybody

43:30.025 --> 43:31.776
you get a chance to.

43:31.818 --> 43:33.320
You're embarrassing.
You're sitting here insulting

43:33.361 --> 43:35.322
my friend, when she was
right trying to defend me.

43:35.363 --> 43:37.198
- Talking about Sarah?
- Yes!

43:37.240 --> 43:39.200
Dude, I didn't insult Sarah.
We just talked about this.

43:39.242 --> 43:41.244
Don't raise your voice to me.
because you will regret it.

43:47.417 --> 43:49.252
[siren]

43:49.294 --> 43:51.087
[Shiva]: I'm just so happy
I'm off that fucking boat.

43:51.129 --> 43:53.673
[Haley]: Shiva is very like
sneaky and kinda like feeds the
drama.

43:53.715 --> 43:55.175
[Olivia]: Yeah.

43:55.216 --> 43:56.760
[Marissa]: They really can't
stand if people

43:56.801 --> 43:58.887
don't like them or like
think they're cool.

43:58.928 --> 44:00.472
[Brianna]: What up?
You guys gonna ignore me?

44:00.513 --> 44:01.473
[Jordan]: Things could
potentially get ugly today.

44:01.514 --> 44:03.266
[Cuppie screaming]

44:03.308 --> 44:06.061
If you and Marissa are up
for it, to be models of mine.

44:06.102 --> 44:07.479
Shut the fuck up.
[whispering]

44:07.520 --> 44:09.189
You want me to have my
titties out on you?

44:11.232 --> 44:13.151
She makes an ass look beautiful,
I'll tell you that.

44:13.193 --> 44:16.863
My grandparents don't
know that I date girls.

44:16.905 --> 44:18.156
What did I just do?

44:18.198 --> 44:19.783
We knew something
was going on.

44:19.824 --> 44:21.326
You didn't say anything
to me?
