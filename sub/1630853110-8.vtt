00:17.809 --> 00:21.021
(in Japanese) Whatever I do,
it's always the same.

00:21.104 --> 00:23.565
They always gang up on me.

00:23.649 --> 00:25.567
Hey, don't be a crybaby!

00:25.651 --> 00:26.818
It's embarrassing.

00:27.444 --> 00:30.948
But the tears just come out.

00:31.031 --> 00:32.824
Next time, they'll be the ones crying.

00:32.908 --> 00:36.537
You always say that, but we never win.

00:38.539 --> 00:41.250
Because you always give up!

00:41.333 --> 00:43.585
I told you, like this…

00:44.837 --> 00:46.004
(in Korean) Noa!

00:47.589 --> 00:50.133
See ya! I have the party today.

00:50.217 --> 00:53.387
Don't forget to bring me
some of your aunt's rice cakes!

00:53.470 --> 00:54.721
Papa!

00:56.974 --> 00:58.725
Move over! You reek of garlic.

01:04.397 --> 01:06.024
Noa, don't be like this.

01:06.608 --> 01:10.112
Today's celebration
is not just about your little brother.

01:12.656 --> 01:14.074
You must understand,

01:14.157 --> 01:17.494
not too long ago, many of our babies died
before their first birthdays.

01:18.161 --> 01:20.247
This celebration, it's for all of us.

01:20.747 --> 01:21.874
I don't know.

01:21.957 --> 01:24.835
It feels like it's always about him.

01:27.337 --> 01:28.422
Noa,

01:29.006 --> 01:30.799
you're the older brother now.

01:30.883 --> 01:33.385
Your brother will count on you
for many things.

01:33.468 --> 01:36.305
But you swear
I had a first birthday party too?

01:40.225 --> 01:42.853
How could I lie about such a thing?

01:44.354 --> 01:46.148
Times were harder for us then,

01:46.231 --> 01:47.941
but you never went without.

01:48.025 --> 01:49.902
You should thank your mother for that.

01:49.985 --> 01:52.905
And you're absolutely sure
I picked the red yarn?

01:52.988 --> 01:55.490
You don't know how happy it made us.

01:55.574 --> 01:58.035
But it's not really an exciting future
for me, is it?

01:59.578 --> 02:02.080
Why couldn't I have picked
the bow and arrow?

02:02.164 --> 02:03.165
Noa,

02:04.041 --> 02:07.294
trust me,
a long life is nothing to scoff at.

02:08.002 --> 02:11.173
Well, Mozasu better pick the coins.

02:11.256 --> 02:14.927
He has a beggar in his belly,
so he needs to be rich.

02:15.719 --> 02:18.555
Papa, why do you keep laughing?
I'm serious.

02:18.639 --> 02:20.349
You really should pray for it.

02:40.369 --> 02:43.121
Thank you all for coming
to celebrate our son's first year.

02:43.914 --> 02:46.583
As you can see, he is clearly flourishing.

02:47.918 --> 02:49.419
The Lord has truly blessed us.

02:52.256 --> 02:54.383
This tradition of the doljabi

02:54.967 --> 02:59.721
binds us not only to you all
but also to those who came before--

02:59.805 --> 03:01.974
Enough words.

03:02.558 --> 03:05.477
Save them for your sermons.

03:07.104 --> 03:10.190
My brother is eager
to meet my son's fortune.

03:10.274 --> 03:11.608
How could I deny him that?

03:13.569 --> 03:17.614
It's time for Mozasu to choose his fate.

03:17.698 --> 03:19.700
Can't I just pick for him?

03:23.203 --> 03:26.790
Mozasu, let's pick!

05:19.486 --> 05:20.612
So,

05:21.196 --> 05:23.156
it's coming.

05:24.992 --> 05:26.076
The end.

05:28.620 --> 05:30.414
I would prepare yourself.

05:37.045 --> 05:41.967
Is she… in much pain?

05:42.050 --> 05:44.386
She won't tell us.

05:46.805 --> 05:47.806
Yes.

05:48.515 --> 05:49.808
Tremendous pain.

05:51.435 --> 05:53.187
We can give her morphine.

05:53.937 --> 05:55.522
But I must inform you,

05:55.606 --> 05:59.401
at the dosage required to stem her pain,

06:00.068 --> 06:01.695
she will be with us in body,

06:01.778 --> 06:04.948
but her spirit might as well be gone.

06:07.451 --> 06:10.662
No. I don't want her like that.

06:10.746 --> 06:13.290
But Etsuko, what's best for Hana--

06:13.373 --> 06:16.960
Stay out of this!

06:26.553 --> 06:28.805
Slow down now!

06:28.889 --> 06:30.265
You'll trample over one another,

06:30.349 --> 06:32.643
and we'll have a body
to pick off the ground.

06:32.726 --> 06:35.812
Too many people here now.

06:35.896 --> 06:36.939
Mama!

06:37.856 --> 06:39.191
Mama!

06:41.068 --> 06:42.986
What is it? Are you hurt?

06:43.070 --> 06:44.613
I waited almost an hour.

06:45.531 --> 06:47.199
Why didn't he come?

06:48.283 --> 06:49.409
What do you mean?

06:49.493 --> 06:51.537
Your father didn't pick you up
from school?

06:53.664 --> 06:54.998
Mama, look.

06:55.082 --> 06:56.416
Something's happening.

06:59.044 --> 07:03.257
Excuse me. Please excuse me.

07:03.924 --> 07:05.801
Did you check in there?

07:05.884 --> 07:08.345
They're saying he's a traitor.

07:12.808 --> 07:13.892
Mrs. Baek!

07:17.145 --> 07:18.605
Where's my husband?

07:21.483 --> 07:23.068
He's been arrested.

07:23.777 --> 07:25.028
Arrested?

07:25.654 --> 07:26.822
Why?

07:26.905 --> 07:29.366
They won't say.

07:29.950 --> 07:32.911
Just that the crime
is of the most serious nature.

07:32.995 --> 07:34.371
Where is he now?

07:34.454 --> 07:36.874
They're questioning him
at the local station.

07:37.541 --> 07:39.751
They must've mistaken him
for someone else.

07:41.003 --> 07:42.963
I must go to him right away.

07:43.046 --> 07:44.131
Child, listen.

07:44.214 --> 07:48.302
Those men came here
specifically looking for Isak.

07:49.011 --> 07:50.679
Do you know what that means?

07:51.680 --> 07:54.850
It means someone named him.

07:55.934 --> 07:58.353
You must be careful,

07:59.021 --> 08:00.606
and you must pray.

08:05.235 --> 08:06.361
Noa,

08:06.445 --> 08:08.447
go find your uncle.
Bring him to the station.

08:09.031 --> 08:10.032
Can you do that?

08:10.866 --> 08:11.867
Go now.

08:40.187 --> 08:41.855
Noa, what are you doing here?

08:41.938 --> 08:44.775
-You must come! Papa has been arrested.
-Arrested?

08:44.858 --> 08:47.194
-He was arrested?
-They took him to the station.

08:47.277 --> 08:48.737
Mama is there now.

08:49.321 --> 08:50.739
I need to tell my boss.

08:52.616 --> 08:54.076
Wait here.

09:06.171 --> 09:07.506
We have an hour.

09:09.049 --> 09:10.467
Let's get your father out.

09:12.678 --> 09:14.388
This makes no sense to me.

09:16.265 --> 09:17.474
How is this possible?

09:18.475 --> 09:21.311
You closed the deal.

09:21.395 --> 09:23.188
Why would they fire you?

09:23.272 --> 09:25.691
She changed her mind at the last minute.

09:26.817 --> 09:27.901
But why?

09:28.569 --> 09:30.571
Because I told her to.

09:31.989 --> 09:33.407
Why would you do that?

09:33.991 --> 09:35.534
I wanted to.

09:40.873 --> 09:43.292
I can't understand this, but enough.

09:44.001 --> 09:46.253
Go back to America, understand?

09:46.336 --> 09:47.588
I can't go back.

09:48.338 --> 09:49.756
I lost my visa.

09:53.802 --> 09:55.012
What do we do then?

09:55.095 --> 09:58.056
America's not the answer.
That's a fantasy.

09:58.140 --> 09:59.516
What are you talking about?

09:59.600 --> 10:03.896
Papa, no one's going to hire me now.

10:05.189 --> 10:07.858
The only one who'll work with me

10:07.941 --> 10:09.443
is Yoshii-san.

10:11.820 --> 10:14.323
He came to see me the other day.

10:15.824 --> 10:17.284
He heard what happened.

10:17.367 --> 10:19.244
I don't care what he's offering.

10:19.328 --> 10:21.330
You will have nothing to do with him!

10:21.413 --> 10:23.332
He wants to open pachinko parlors--

10:23.415 --> 10:24.666
Pachinko? You?

10:24.750 --> 10:27.669
You and Grandmother always say
there's no shame in it--

10:27.753 --> 10:30.047
For me, yes, but for my son?

10:31.423 --> 10:35.302
I know that bullshit Yoshii fed you.

10:35.886 --> 10:38.597
He said it was all legitimate,

10:38.680 --> 10:39.890
didn't he?

10:39.973 --> 10:42.100
You know how I know?

10:43.143 --> 10:45.687
Because his grandfather
once said the same thing to me.

10:50.400 --> 10:55.405
Like you, I wanted too much, too fast.

10:57.241 --> 11:02.371
But thanks to your mother and
grandmother, I was spared that fate.

11:02.454 --> 11:05.541
If it weren't for them,
who knows what would've happened.

11:06.583 --> 11:08.585
That happened a long time ago.

11:08.669 --> 11:10.420
Mamoru Yoshii had nothing to do--

11:10.504 --> 11:12.130
It's the same blood!

11:12.214 --> 11:14.508
The grandfather's blood
runs through his grandson.

11:14.591 --> 11:16.260
That's ridiculous.

11:16.343 --> 11:18.804
I won't allow it!

11:18.887 --> 11:20.639
Even for all the riches in the world--

11:20.722 --> 11:23.809
You sound like it doesn't matter.
The money, the success.

11:26.144 --> 11:28.146
That's not what I'm saying.

11:28.230 --> 11:29.481
I get it,

11:30.148 --> 11:31.233
but your dreams,

11:32.442 --> 11:35.320
they're just not enough for me.

11:47.791 --> 11:50.419
Noa, what are they saying?

11:50.502 --> 11:55.132
Papa is being questioned
by the "higher police" or something.

11:56.842 --> 12:01.096
He says Papa is weak,
so he would die in prison.

12:12.274 --> 12:13.275
What's happening?

12:13.358 --> 12:15.527
Uncle got in trouble.

12:19.114 --> 12:24.453
He's saying Papa can return home
if he is innocent,

12:24.536 --> 12:28.165
but if he is guilty…

12:31.251 --> 12:33.003
Now he said that's enough.

12:34.046 --> 12:36.798
Other people are waiting.

13:00.614 --> 13:02.950
I will go to my boss and explain to him.

13:05.577 --> 13:08.705
He'll be furious
when he hears how I've been treated.

13:08.789 --> 13:11.333
And he'll help us then?

13:12.000 --> 13:15.045
Isak will be able to come home tonight?

13:15.587 --> 13:19.049
My brother will not sleep a single night
in a jail cell.

13:21.760 --> 13:23.637
Not Isak.

13:23.720 --> 13:24.847
Never.

13:29.893 --> 13:31.186
What's this face now?

13:33.105 --> 13:34.982
What did I just say?

13:35.065 --> 13:37.234
You're going to bring Papa home.

13:37.317 --> 13:40.320
Of course. I'll bring him back right away.

13:50.038 --> 13:51.123
Excuse me, ma'am.

13:51.206 --> 13:52.916
A moment.

13:53.000 --> 13:54.543
What do you want?

13:54.626 --> 13:56.837
Have they taken your husband as well?

13:57.713 --> 13:59.464
My brother-in-law.

13:59.548 --> 14:00.799
Three months ago.

14:01.341 --> 14:02.509
Three months?

14:02.593 --> 14:05.137
And you haven't seen him since?

14:05.679 --> 14:06.680
No.

14:07.431 --> 14:09.016
When was your husband arrested?

14:10.350 --> 14:11.852
This morning.

14:12.895 --> 14:15.105
But there's been a terrible mistake.

14:15.189 --> 14:18.525
He's just a pastor.
He's not involved in politics.

14:19.818 --> 14:21.778
You are Pastor Baek's wife.

14:21.862 --> 14:23.197
How…

14:23.697 --> 14:25.699
how do you know my husband?

14:29.578 --> 14:31.163
Not here.

14:33.415 --> 14:35.042
Noa, let's go.

14:50.265 --> 14:52.809
Are there really spies everywhere?

14:52.893 --> 14:55.562
Especially now
that they're gearing for more war.

14:55.646 --> 14:58.649
But isn't there always some war somewhere?

14:58.732 --> 15:00.442
What does it have to do with us here?

15:00.526 --> 15:04.321
Aren't we the ones
who always bear the brunt?

15:04.821 --> 15:08.075
Your husband taught us that.

15:10.786 --> 15:13.163
So, you knew my husband well?

15:13.247 --> 15:15.207
My brother-in-law knew him well.

15:15.290 --> 15:18.210
At first,
he was suspicious of your husband,

15:18.293 --> 15:22.172
as were the other men
at the factories around here.

15:23.215 --> 15:28.053
But the Pastor earned their trust,
their love even.

15:29.263 --> 15:33.851
He taught the men
that there is power in numbers.

15:34.685 --> 15:37.980
We weren't used to
hearing such power in words.

15:39.815 --> 15:41.859
He made us feel proud.

15:43.151 --> 15:44.862
My husband did all that?

15:46.071 --> 15:47.406
He did.

15:48.031 --> 15:50.450
And even as our bellies cried in hunger,

15:50.534 --> 15:53.495
we fed off his hope.

15:54.705 --> 15:56.331
But now what will we do?

16:04.506 --> 16:05.757
How old are you?

16:06.842 --> 16:08.510
Seven.

16:10.137 --> 16:13.265
A boy should have a father.

16:15.893 --> 16:16.935
Now come.

16:17.019 --> 16:19.021
We must tell Hasegawa-san what's happened.

16:19.605 --> 16:23.108
-Who is that?
-You don't even know Hasegawa?

16:26.778 --> 16:29.323
Apparently, I know nothing.

16:30.407 --> 16:33.368
Then it's time for you to meet.

16:39.958 --> 16:41.376
Mama!

16:42.961 --> 16:44.505
What did they arrest him for?

16:45.172 --> 16:46.673
I wish I knew.

16:47.257 --> 16:49.760
The police wouldn't say why.

16:49.843 --> 16:52.179
Normally they tell someone
why they're being arrested.

16:52.262 --> 16:55.390
I knew you'd understand, Shimamura-san.

16:55.891 --> 16:57.935
The whole thing is ridiculous.

16:58.018 --> 17:00.479
To lump my brother in
with those unpatriotic persons--

17:00.562 --> 17:02.648
What is it that you say? Unpatriotic?

17:03.148 --> 17:05.943
Yes, it makes no sense, right?

17:06.026 --> 17:09.363
My brother would never get involved
in anything like that.

17:09.863 --> 17:13.157
You never mentioned
it was a political crime.

17:14.367 --> 17:16.662
But my brother's innocent--

17:16.744 --> 17:18.789
-That's not what the police believe.
-I swear to you--

17:18.872 --> 17:21.708
You're his family.
Of course that's what you say.

17:23.836 --> 17:25.753
You're putting me in a difficult position.

17:26.755 --> 17:29.383
The other workers respect you.

17:30.008 --> 17:33.011
But they say you can't fight blood.

17:34.471 --> 17:39.017
The blood that runs in your brother
courses through you as well.

17:39.643 --> 17:43.272
Please, I need this job.
My family depends on me.

17:43.856 --> 17:47.609
I'm sorry, but I have to let you go.

18:25.731 --> 18:27.065
Say…

18:30.569 --> 18:32.821
I need you to do something for me.

18:33.322 --> 18:35.115
Anything.

18:39.745 --> 18:42.623
After I'm gone,

18:45.417 --> 18:49.922
take care of her for me. My mother.

19:02.267 --> 19:03.560
Hana.

19:08.815 --> 19:10.484
Are you scared?

19:12.236 --> 19:14.196
I'm scared.

19:17.783 --> 19:22.579
I never dreamed it would end like this.

19:24.248 --> 19:25.874
Here,

19:26.917 --> 19:29.878
in this shitty room.

19:32.130 --> 19:35.467
But Hawaii.

19:35.551 --> 19:38.929
That would've been a glorious death.

19:40.973 --> 19:44.017
My feet sinking into the warm sand.

19:45.060 --> 19:47.938
The sound of waves holding me close.

19:51.275 --> 19:54.361
But I guess it's all the same in the end.

19:56.655 --> 19:58.782
Death is death.

20:03.912 --> 20:10.085
I ran away, Solomon. I squandered it all.

20:12.171 --> 20:15.674
I don't want that for you.

20:18.677 --> 20:20.095
I'm sorry.

20:21.597 --> 20:23.682
Why are you apologizing?

20:29.188 --> 20:32.149
I left you behind. I'm sorry.

20:35.444 --> 20:39.489
I'm sorry I didn't look for you sooner.

20:40.240 --> 20:42.951
I always played by their rules.

20:45.787 --> 20:50.459
I did everything they asked of me.

20:59.092 --> 21:02.262
And they made a fool out of you,
didn't they?

21:04.139 --> 21:05.432
Yes.

21:06.016 --> 21:08.519
They made a fool out of me.

21:33.001 --> 21:34.711
Solomon,

21:34.795 --> 21:38.674
it's time to stop feeling sorry
for yourself.

21:38.757 --> 21:40.300
Enough.

21:41.468 --> 21:45.305
Whatever it takes, grab it all.

21:46.014 --> 21:48.851
Show them no mercy.

21:50.644 --> 21:56.066
Because what mercy did they ever show us?

22:00.404 --> 22:02.239
Fuck them.

22:07.286 --> 22:09.121
Do it for me.

22:20.132 --> 22:23.510
Our pastor has been taken.

22:29.641 --> 22:35.022
Hasegawa and his daughter have been hiding
since the arrests started.

22:35.606 --> 22:39.693
Go, talk to him. He'll have your answers.

22:43.280 --> 22:45.449
He says come in and sit.

22:55.459 --> 22:58.086
He says I look like Papa.

23:09.973 --> 23:12.142
Papa talked about you so much,

23:12.226 --> 23:14.436
she says you feel like a sister.

23:15.270 --> 23:16.939
I see.

23:18.023 --> 23:20.859
But you are both strangers to me.

23:22.277 --> 23:23.987
He never mentioned either of you.

23:32.829 --> 23:35.415
Papa didn't want us to know about them.

23:45.634 --> 23:47.177
To protect us,

23:47.261 --> 23:49.847
he had to split up the two worlds.

23:49.930 --> 23:51.849
Something like that.

23:52.432 --> 23:54.560
But what is this place?

23:55.143 --> 23:57.396
Who are you really?

24:09.867 --> 24:13.036
He is a professor, and…

24:13.120 --> 24:18.166
a… Communist-something?

24:33.390 --> 24:38.604
He and Papa dreamed of bringing together
workers from other countries.

24:39.479 --> 24:43.984
To fight for peace and fair wages.

24:45.944 --> 24:48.363
Then it's true.

24:48.906 --> 24:51.491
You were both working against the emperor.

24:57.581 --> 25:00.250
"It's the emperor
who fights against them."

25:02.419 --> 25:04.296
So,

25:04.880 --> 25:07.174
what happens to us now?

25:07.257 --> 25:09.635
While you men were growing heavy
with these dreams,

25:09.718 --> 25:11.220
who is to put food on our tables,

25:11.303 --> 25:13.722
or clothes on my children's back?

25:16.808 --> 25:20.103
Were we ever a thought to either of you?

25:24.733 --> 25:27.444
She says Papa did it for you and me.

25:34.368 --> 25:37.120
How dare you talk to me like that?

25:38.413 --> 25:40.165
Look at your hands.

25:41.667 --> 25:45.879
They've never seen a day's work.

25:45.963 --> 25:47.589
Who are you

25:47.673 --> 25:50.259
to tell me my fears are meaningless?

25:55.389 --> 25:57.641
We don't have time for this.

25:57.724 --> 26:00.227
We need to get your father home.

26:02.020 --> 26:03.355
He says we won't find him.

26:11.738 --> 26:13.824
He's lying!

26:14.658 --> 26:16.952
He says Papa won't ever come home
because he was betrayed!

26:19.288 --> 26:21.164
Mama, it's the police!

26:34.136 --> 26:35.596
I'm pleased.

26:35.679 --> 26:37.806
We'll be good partners together.

26:38.473 --> 26:41.894
I didn't come here to talk about pachinko.

26:43.270 --> 26:46.023
Colton Hotels, they're still a player.

26:59.995 --> 27:02.581
I'm guessing you have a plan?
Let's hear it.

27:03.582 --> 27:05.334
Between Colton and Abe-san,

27:05.417 --> 27:08.545
nearly ten billion yen
have already been sunk into the project.

27:09.046 --> 27:12.132
But it won't be easy for them to liquidate
the surrounding properties so quickly.

27:12.216 --> 27:14.426
Not with that crucial piece
of land missing.

27:15.052 --> 27:17.721
There's an opportunity here,
a lucrative one.

27:18.222 --> 27:21.850
Because whoever gets that woman's land
can ask for anything.

27:21.934 --> 27:24.269
And what makes you think
she'll sell to you this time?

27:24.811 --> 27:26.438
She won't. I know that.

27:26.522 --> 27:29.107
But you…

27:32.236 --> 27:33.862
you have your ways, don't you?

27:37.241 --> 27:38.450
You get her to sell.

27:39.201 --> 27:41.078
I'll handle the sale
to Colton and Abe-san.

27:42.579 --> 27:45.332
And I'll make them bleed for it.
That's the point.

27:53.340 --> 27:54.424
You see all that?

27:55.801 --> 27:57.386
What if I told you, in two years,

27:57.469 --> 28:00.389
all that land will be worth
a quarter of what it is now?

28:00.472 --> 28:01.765
Not possible.

28:02.349 --> 28:04.893
What do you think the collateral
on all that is, out there?

28:04.977 --> 28:06.645
Usually some other company assets.

28:09.606 --> 28:12.943
And if I said the banks have been taking
the land itself as collateral?

28:13.944 --> 28:15.279
That's crazy.

28:16.113 --> 28:17.531
And yet, it's true.

28:18.156 --> 28:19.867
Everyone's lost their minds.

28:19.950 --> 28:23.453
Too busy gorging themselves off
the feast they think will never end.

28:24.580 --> 28:25.747
But it will.

28:26.331 --> 28:30.752
As soon as the first bank calls in a loan,
it all comes crashing down.

28:35.966 --> 28:37.551
So we better be quick about it.

28:56.445 --> 28:58.363
There's one more thing.

28:59.281 --> 29:02.492
But this one is personal.

29:03.660 --> 29:06.914
I want to do something for a friend.

29:10.042 --> 29:14.004
Don't you think you should

29:14.087 --> 29:17.549
wait to see how you feel in a day or two?

29:22.888 --> 29:23.931
That way--

29:24.014 --> 29:25.599
Mama.

29:27.601 --> 29:33.315
I'm not getting any better.

29:36.860 --> 29:41.073
I'm just… so tired.

29:45.744 --> 29:49.581
I'm ready for a long sleep.

30:06.765 --> 30:09.351
I'll go tell the doctor.

30:12.396 --> 30:13.689
Mama.

30:25.534 --> 30:28.078
I know.

30:30.122 --> 30:31.456
I know.

30:42.092 --> 30:43.677
I just don't understand.

30:43.760 --> 30:45.304
How did it all go so wrong?

30:46.680 --> 30:50.017
Keep it together.
Don't feel sorry for yourself.

30:50.100 --> 30:51.518
It's not over yet.

30:52.060 --> 30:53.854
But Mother--

30:54.479 --> 30:56.315
A girl is dying.

30:56.398 --> 30:58.066
Have some perspective.

30:58.150 --> 30:59.860
I know,

30:59.943 --> 31:02.070
but aren't you concerned at all?

31:02.154 --> 31:04.615
After all these years,

31:04.698 --> 31:07.034
why are those people
barging back into our lives?

31:08.619 --> 31:10.746
Solomon is a good boy.

31:11.705 --> 31:12.706
We raised him right--

31:12.789 --> 31:14.791
But wasn't Noa raised right?

31:14.875 --> 31:16.293
Look what happened to him.

31:18.086 --> 31:23.050
Just because we love them
doesn't mean we know them.

31:29.139 --> 31:31.558
Were you aware
of your husband's involvement

31:31.642 --> 31:34.228
with the General Council
of Labor Unions of Japan?

31:34.978 --> 31:35.979
What is that?

31:43.278 --> 31:47.533
Have you read or written
any anti-government literature?

31:47.616 --> 31:49.576
I…

31:52.663 --> 31:55.874
don't know how to read or write.

32:04.007 --> 32:09.388
Have you been to any meetings
with negative views against the emperor?

32:10.347 --> 32:12.140
I've never been to a meeting.

32:12.224 --> 32:14.726
Until today, I've never even heard
these kinds of words before.

32:19.189 --> 32:22.276
And yet you are married to an agitator.

32:27.197 --> 32:29.533
The man I know…

32:31.368 --> 32:33.495
is a husband,

32:33.579 --> 32:35.289
a father,

32:35.372 --> 32:36.957
a pastor…

32:40.627 --> 32:42.546
a good man.

32:51.597 --> 32:53.515
I'm sorry.

32:54.975 --> 32:57.227
I don't know why I'm saying these things.

32:58.812 --> 32:59.813
Mother?

32:59.897 --> 33:03.025
You think
I would let that happen to Solomon?

33:03.108 --> 33:04.860
Are you crazy?

33:08.238 --> 33:10.449
Solomon is not your brother.

33:10.991 --> 33:13.243
And what happened then,

33:14.161 --> 33:17.247
I won't let it happen again.

33:50.280 --> 33:52.241
Let's go.

34:07.130 --> 34:09.007
It will take effect soon.

34:10.634 --> 34:12.219
In five to ten minutes.

34:12.761 --> 34:14.263
If you need me, please call.

34:16.849 --> 34:19.810
You can't catch it just by looking at me.

34:21.770 --> 34:23.938
She meant no harm.

34:30.654 --> 34:33.614
You will feel the effects
in five or ten minutes.

34:34.408 --> 34:36.159
I will check on you then,

34:36.243 --> 34:38.620
but if you need anything, press this.

34:39.288 --> 34:41.123
I'll come right away.

34:41.915 --> 34:43.292
Is there anything else?

34:44.458 --> 34:45.710
Thank you.

34:50.757 --> 34:52.801
Solomon…

34:52.885 --> 34:53.886
where is he?

35:01.351 --> 35:03.187
When will he come?

35:23.123 --> 35:24.333
Noa.

35:25.459 --> 35:26.460
Papa!

35:27.503 --> 35:29.129
-Noa!
-Enough!

35:31.548 --> 35:33.467
-Papa!
-Shut up!

35:33.550 --> 35:35.594
-Noa!
-Papa!

35:35.677 --> 35:37.554
Let go of my daddy!

35:40.224 --> 35:41.225
Noa!

35:41.892 --> 35:45.020
Papa! Papa!

35:46.980 --> 35:50.025
Don't take my father away!
He can't leave us!

35:54.488 --> 35:57.449
Papa, don't go!

35:57.533 --> 35:59.034
You can't leave us!

35:59.117 --> 36:00.494
Papa!

36:14.424 --> 36:15.759
Papa!

36:37.197 --> 36:42.244
…it's been nearly 50 years
since the last asteroid came this close.

36:42.327 --> 36:45.706
On its trajectory toward the sun,

36:45.789 --> 36:51.587
this asteroid came
within 500,000 miles to Earth.

36:52.713 --> 36:55.841
Scientists estimate that the asteroid

36:55.924 --> 36:58.594
is traveling at 46,000 miles per hour…

36:58.677 --> 37:00.846
What are you doing?

37:00.929 --> 37:04.516
You have the paperwork
signed by the director of this hospital.

37:04.600 --> 37:05.809
Yes, but how did you--

37:05.893 --> 37:07.227
That doesn't matter.

37:08.061 --> 37:10.147
You're going on a trip. Ready?

37:10.772 --> 37:13.442
-I wanna go.
-Where are you going?

37:13.525 --> 37:14.860
What are you saying?

37:17.279 --> 37:18.864
Be careful!

37:20.115 --> 37:23.035
What's he doing? Slow down!

37:23.118 --> 37:24.745
You're going too fast!

38:07.204 --> 38:08.205
Hawaii.

38:23.136 --> 38:24.137
Mama!

38:57.754 --> 38:59.089
Mama,

39:00.215 --> 39:02.176
I'm going to sleep now.

39:08.056 --> 39:09.099
Sweet dreams.

39:10.642 --> 39:12.811
My little Hana.

39:20.110 --> 39:21.612
Sweet dreams.

40:47.281 --> 40:49.741
I'm going to take care of everything now.

40:50.909 --> 40:52.327
Don't worry.

41:53.680 --> 41:56.558
I used to think this watch was a curse.

41:58.477 --> 42:00.854
But I realize now,

42:02.606 --> 42:05.526
this watch saved our family.

42:20.123 --> 42:23.043
Perhaps it will do that for you as well.

42:24.837 --> 42:26.880
That is my hope.

42:40.018 --> 42:41.436
MATH THE 6TH GRADE
SOCIAL STUDIES

43:18.891 --> 43:20.434
What's with those dogs?

43:21.185 --> 43:22.811
Take them away!

43:22.895 --> 43:24.479
You're waking the street.

44:05.854 --> 44:06.855
Sunja,

44:06.939 --> 44:08.232
what is this?

44:12.194 --> 44:13.820
You're making kimchi?

44:13.904 --> 44:15.489
But why so much?

44:16.073 --> 44:17.866
I'll ferment one half

44:17.950 --> 44:19.826
and take the other half to market.

44:21.245 --> 44:24.164
I'm hoping there will be
those who like fresh kimchi.

44:28.168 --> 44:30.170
He won't be happy.

44:31.421 --> 44:33.382
What choice do we have?

44:42.724 --> 44:44.810
Please understand.

44:50.816 --> 44:52.693
You don't think I'll find another job?

44:53.485 --> 44:55.237
That's what this is about, isn't it?

44:56.738 --> 44:59.491
Just so you know,
I got a lead over at the tire factory.

44:59.992 --> 45:01.910
Of course, we know you'll get another job.

45:01.994 --> 45:04.955
I'm sure Sunja means
for this just to be temporary.

45:06.456 --> 45:09.293
I mean no disrespect. You must know that.

45:09.877 --> 45:12.296
But we have no money coming in,

45:12.379 --> 45:14.882
and our savings will run out
in a few days.

45:15.674 --> 45:17.676
I must think of the boys now.

45:17.759 --> 45:19.344
And you think I don't?

45:19.428 --> 45:21.889
You don't think it kills me to know

45:21.972 --> 45:23.557
my baby brother is in a prison somewhere?

45:25.392 --> 45:27.144
He's in prison!

45:31.899 --> 45:35.819
Whether I have to beg or borrow,
those boys will never go hungry.

45:36.320 --> 45:38.071
Not in my house.

45:39.615 --> 45:41.867
Then let me help you.

45:43.577 --> 45:45.829
Because if I don't do something…

45:48.040 --> 45:50.709
This helplessness, I can't bear it.

46:33.335 --> 46:35.379
What's with the face?

46:37.297 --> 46:39.716
Aren't you going to school?

46:44.429 --> 46:46.098
When I was your age,

46:46.890 --> 46:49.101
we couldn't afford school.

46:51.353 --> 46:55.274
This is a privilege.
Don't take it for granted.

46:56.859 --> 46:58.443
Who are you?

47:00.445 --> 47:01.697
Why do you walk this path?

47:01.780 --> 47:03.574
There's a shorter route.

47:04.241 --> 47:07.035
How do you know where my school is?

47:07.619 --> 47:09.204
I know many things.

47:10.080 --> 47:12.082
It's what protects me.

47:13.500 --> 47:15.502
Remember that.

47:19.423 --> 47:21.884
My father preferred this way.

47:22.551 --> 47:24.344
And why is that?

47:24.428 --> 47:28.432
There's an old woman down the street
who has a piano.

47:29.183 --> 47:32.436
She plays every morning
on our way to school.

47:33.353 --> 47:36.106
My father liked to hear the music.

47:43.238 --> 47:45.490
Have you heard of the Kanto earthquake?

47:48.035 --> 47:50.120
You should answer
when addressed by an adult.

47:50.829 --> 47:52.039
No.

47:52.539 --> 47:54.208
It was before you were born.

47:54.875 --> 47:56.710
A terrible earthquake.

47:59.588 --> 48:03.091
So bad it split our world
into a before and after.

48:06.637 --> 48:08.222
I lost my father then as well.

48:08.931 --> 48:11.642
How did you know my father is gone?

48:15.562 --> 48:18.315
Right, protection.

48:20.108 --> 48:21.109
That's right.

48:21.193 --> 48:22.653
You learn quickly.

48:24.154 --> 48:25.447
And so, learn this.

48:26.949 --> 48:28.408
Noa,

48:29.159 --> 48:30.953
it's not good enough to just survive.

48:31.537 --> 48:33.956
People will tell you otherwise,
but ignore them.

48:34.748 --> 48:35.958
Think about it.

48:36.583 --> 48:38.627
Cockroaches can just survive.

48:39.211 --> 48:41.296
Should that be good enough for us?

48:52.474 --> 48:54.935
Be better than everyone around you.

48:56.937 --> 48:59.439
Not just the Koreans,
but the Japanese as well.

48:59.523 --> 49:02.234
Be so good
that they can't deny you what you're owed.

49:02.317 --> 49:03.819
Make no mistake.

49:06.196 --> 49:08.740
They'll hate to see you rise.

49:10.117 --> 49:13.579
But even with their hate,
they'll have no choice but to respect you.

49:14.955 --> 49:16.999
Do you understand what I am saying?

49:18.500 --> 49:19.877
Yes.

49:21.753 --> 49:22.838
One more thing.

49:23.422 --> 49:24.965
Never look back.

49:26.008 --> 49:27.593
Forward.

49:28.719 --> 49:30.554
Always forward.

49:46.820 --> 49:49.364
Now go to school
and wipe that glum look off your face.

49:49.448 --> 49:51.033
Tomorrow, take the short way.

49:51.909 --> 49:53.994
Only fools would choose otherwise.

49:55.996 --> 49:57.539
Noa,

49:58.749 --> 50:00.000
don't live like a fool.

50:19.603 --> 50:22.064
I hate that you're going alone.

50:23.273 --> 50:26.360
Who's going to watch Mozasu
or have dinner ready?

50:27.110 --> 50:28.529
Don't worry.

50:28.612 --> 50:29.738
I'll be fine.

50:35.410 --> 50:36.245
And you,

50:36.328 --> 50:39.748
no troublemaking today, understand?

50:44.461 --> 50:47.339
Looking at his face,
I think this is the hardest part of all.

50:47.422 --> 50:50.092
But he'll grow up
knowing you do this for him.

50:50.175 --> 50:52.636
That his mother worked so hard
to raise him.

51:18.245 --> 51:19.288
Excuse me.

51:19.371 --> 51:20.414
Excuse me.

51:22.040 --> 51:23.333
Sorry.

51:26.378 --> 51:27.379
Excuse me.

51:30.716 --> 51:31.925
What do you think you're doing?

51:32.009 --> 51:33.427
Move it!

51:34.678 --> 51:38.015
Go on. Get outta here! You'll chase away
the customers with that stink.

51:38.098 --> 51:39.141
Hurry and get outta here!

51:39.808 --> 51:41.852
I'm sorry. It's my first day.

51:48.192 --> 51:49.526
Don't even try!

51:49.610 --> 51:51.486
Get your stinky cart out of here!

51:51.570 --> 51:55.157
Want my son to piss on it?

52:24.269 --> 52:25.270
Excuse me.

52:25.854 --> 52:27.231
Excuse me.

52:29.942 --> 52:31.109
Excuse me.

52:32.361 --> 52:35.197
Young lady, over here!

52:38.075 --> 52:39.076
Over here.

52:43.664 --> 52:45.415
You can sell here.

52:46.208 --> 52:48.919
Thank you! Please come again.

52:49.837 --> 52:51.380
Come, look!

52:51.463 --> 52:53.966

53:02.850 --> 53:03.976

55:35.460 --> 55:37.963
Best kimchi in the world!

55:38.839 --> 55:40.757
My mother's special recipe!

55:40.841 --> 55:42.968
This is my country's food!

56:59.044 --> 57:04.341
I think I came here when I was about 18.

57:04.424 --> 57:07.761
I was 13 years old.

57:08.262 --> 57:10.389
We came by boat.

57:11.139 --> 57:13.183
It wasn't a plane.

57:16.061 --> 57:19.064
I'm 22 years old here, so I'm young.

57:19.982 --> 57:23.318
I came to Japan at 20 years old,
after I got married.

57:23.402 --> 57:25.571
I came here alone from Korea.

57:25.654 --> 57:27.781
I was all alone.

57:27.865 --> 57:32.452
I cried and cried. I cried a lot.

57:33.954 --> 57:39.543
I came here at 11
and started working at 13.

57:40.252 --> 57:46.675
I grew up in sadness.

57:47.176 --> 57:50.721
So it's hard for me to be kind
to other people.

57:50.804 --> 57:53.348
I do wonder

57:53.432 --> 57:57.936
if that's because of how I grew up.

57:59.354 --> 58:01.857
I suffered so much after I got here.

58:03.275 --> 58:07.696
I don't like thinking about
those things now, but you know…

58:10.365 --> 58:13.118
I do think about so many things.

58:13.744 --> 58:17.122
I saw people who had died.

58:17.206 --> 58:20.209
I was still a little girl.

58:20.292 --> 58:22.586
It was during the war.

58:22.669 --> 58:29.676
The military police came and grabbed
the ponytails of those who had long hair,

58:29.760 --> 58:33.889
and dragged them off by their hair.

58:33.972 --> 58:35.933
I saw them do that.

58:36.725 --> 58:40.938
We were lucky
if we had some cabbage to eat.

58:41.021 --> 58:47.277
But they ordered us to give it to them
because it all belonged to the emperor.

58:47.361 --> 58:51.240
Nothing you owned
actually belonged to you.

58:51.323 --> 58:55.202
So we all ate kimchi.

58:55.285 --> 58:57.412
We didn't have anything to eat,

58:57.496 --> 59:00.082
so we ate a lot of kimchi.

59:00.666 --> 59:02.626
There was very little food
in our rice bowls,

59:02.709 --> 59:04.461
so we never felt full after we ate.

59:04.545 --> 59:09.258
We'd turn our rice bowls upside-down
to check if there was anything left.

59:09.341 --> 59:11.844
That's how we lived.

59:11.927 --> 59:14.221
Now life is too luxurious.

59:15.472 --> 59:18.600
I couldn't speak any Japanese.

59:18.684 --> 59:20.853
So I really struggled.

59:21.728 --> 59:24.147
I don't like saying this,

59:24.231 --> 59:29.736
but my children couldn't live in Korea.

59:29.820 --> 59:33.490
So I made sure they assimilated
into Japanese society.

59:34.366 --> 59:38.078
Have you gotten used to life in Japan?

59:38.787 --> 59:41.248
I'm used to it now.

59:41.915 --> 59:43.750
It was hard.

59:46.753 --> 59:48.589
This is my hometown now.

59:49.298 --> 59:54.052
I can't go to Korea.
I can't go to my country.

59:54.136 --> 59:57.014
So this is my hometown now.

59:59.308 --> 1:00:01.351
It's all a dream.

1:00:01.435 --> 1:00:03.103
This one's a dream. That one's a dream.

1:00:03.187 --> 1:00:05.522
They're all dreams now.

1:00:10.360 --> 1:00:13.822
I was so young then.

1:00:26.376 --> 1:00:28.962
Well…

1:00:29.922 --> 1:00:32.966
this was the best time of my life.

1:00:33.050 --> 1:00:35.010
What makes you think that?

1:00:35.093 --> 1:00:37.679
Because everyone was close by.

1:01:02.120 --> 1:01:03.580
How old are you?

1:01:04.706 --> 1:01:06.750
I'm 98 years old.

1:01:06.834 --> 1:01:09.294
I'm 85 years old.

1:01:10.712 --> 1:01:13.131
I'm 80--

1:01:13.215 --> 1:01:14.258
No, 90.

1:01:14.341 --> 1:01:15.634
Am I 98?

1:01:15.717 --> 1:01:16.718
Maybe 99?

1:01:16.802 --> 1:01:18.345
I'm 93 years old.

1:01:18.428 --> 1:01:19.555
When were you born?

1:01:19.638 --> 1:01:22.724
In 1917.

1:01:22.808 --> 1:01:24.768
I'm 92.

1:01:24.852 --> 1:01:29.690
I turned 100 years old the other day,
so they had a celebration for me.

1:01:29.773 --> 1:01:31.942
That's why I'm like this.

1:01:32.025 --> 1:01:34.486
I think I'm 95 years old.

1:01:34.570 --> 1:01:36.029
Born in the year of the cow.

1:01:37.489 --> 1:01:42.953
There were no hardships for me
in the life I chose for myself.

1:01:43.036 --> 1:01:47.916
I made my own way, my own path,
so I have no regrets whatsoever

1:01:48.000 --> 1:01:51.587
about the path I chose and walked down.

1:01:51.670 --> 1:01:55.674
My son works very hard.

1:01:55.757 --> 1:01:59.761
I have a good daughter-in-law
and good grandchildren.

1:01:59.845 --> 1:02:04.641
Everyone calls me grandma,
so I'm thankful.

1:02:04.725 --> 1:02:08.604
Your smile is very bright.

1:02:10.147 --> 1:02:15.444
Do you think someone will take me
as his bride?

1:02:15.527 --> 1:02:20.407
My smile, you say. My smile…

1:02:21.950 --> 1:02:28.081
I'm sure it must have been boring,
but thank you for listening.
