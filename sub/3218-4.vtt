WEBVTT

00:02.431 --> 00:05.557
Look, Dad's gone now.
We have to carry out his legacy.

00:05.732 --> 00:09.655
And that means hunting down as many
evil sons of bitches as we possibly can.

00:14.468 --> 00:15.715
What just happened?

00:15.888 --> 00:18.848
That's a Devil's Gate.
A damned door to hell.

00:19.022 --> 00:22.280
How certain
are you that what you brought back...

00:22.450 --> 00:25.124
...is 100 percent pure Sam?

00:30.683 --> 00:32.595
Tell me who you are.
Doesn't matter.

00:32.772 --> 00:35.352
Just tell me who you are.

00:35.531 --> 00:38.074
- You're a demon.
- I wanna help you from time to time.

00:38.247 --> 00:41.088
- Why would you help me?
- I could help save your brother.

00:41.256 --> 00:44.180
Back in 1835,
Samuel Colt made a special gun.

00:44.349 --> 00:46.180
This gun can kill anything.

00:48.000 --> 00:54.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:35.253 --> 01:36.631
One more.

01:39.516 --> 01:41.097
That's all for tonight, Sister.

01:41.271 --> 01:43.981
Come on. Let me walk you
to your car.

01:45.367 --> 01:47.030
Father?

01:48.083 --> 01:51.043
- Andy?
- Father...

01:51.217 --> 01:52.680
...God's not with us.

01:54.603 --> 01:56.766
- Not anymore.
- Andy, of course he is.

01:57.528 --> 02:00.952
- Why would say that? What's wrong?
He can't help us.

02:01.248 --> 02:03.245
And if he can...

02:03.421 --> 02:05.216
...he won't.

02:07.308 --> 02:08.473
Andy, wait!

02:31.551 --> 02:33.678
Hey.
- Hey, what's up?

02:33.850 --> 02:37.938
Might've found some omens in Ohio.
Dry lightning, barometric pressure drop.

02:38.112 --> 02:39.490
That's thrilling.

02:39.658 --> 02:43.450
Plus, guy blows his head off in a church
and another goes postal in a hobby shop.

02:43.629 --> 02:46.006
- Might be demonic omens.
- Or it could be a suicide...

02:46.178 --> 02:49.020
...and a psycho scrapbooker.
- But it's our best lead since Lincoln.

02:49.188 --> 02:50.305
- Where?
- Elizabethville.

02:50.483 --> 02:52.729
It's a half-dead factory town
in the rust belt.

02:52.907 --> 02:54.570
There's gotta be a demon
in South Beach.

02:54.745 --> 02:57.207
Sorry, Hef, maybe next time.

02:57.379 --> 03:00.053
- How's it going, Bobby?
- Slow.

03:00.221 --> 03:02.978
Man, I tell you,
it's sad seeing the Colt like that.

03:03.147 --> 03:05.642
Only thing it's good for
is figuring out what makes it tick.

03:05.821 --> 03:06.938
So, what makes it tick?

03:10.962 --> 03:13.921
So if we wanna go check out
these omens in Ohio...

03:14.096 --> 03:16.557
...think you can have
that ready by this afternoon?

03:18.902 --> 03:22.859
Well, it won't kill demons by then,
but I can promise you it'll kill you.

03:23.667 --> 03:26.543
- Come on. We're wasting the daylight.
- See you, Bobby.

03:26.717 --> 03:31.306
Hey, you boys run into anything,
anything, you call me.

03:46.569 --> 03:48.899
There's not much left
for the insurance company.

03:49.076 --> 03:51.037
It was a suicide. Saw it myself.

03:51.208 --> 03:53.704
Well, this shouldn't take long, then.

03:56.850 --> 03:58.513
That's where Andy did it.

03:58.688 --> 04:02.529
It's the first time I'd seen him in weeks.
He used to come every Sunday.

04:02.701 --> 04:04.448
When did he stop?

04:04.623 --> 04:07.417
Oh, probably about two months ago.

04:07.591 --> 04:10.051
Right around the time
everything else started to change.

04:10.224 --> 04:12.018
Change how?

04:12.313 --> 04:15.855
Oh, let's just say this used to be a town
you could be proud of.

04:16.702 --> 04:19.541
People cared about each other.

04:21.089 --> 04:22.291
Andy sang in the choir.

04:22.469 --> 04:25.392
And then one day he just
wasn't Andy anymore.

04:25.561 --> 04:27.058
It was like he was...

04:27.234 --> 04:28.897
Possessed?

04:29.950 --> 04:31.447
You could say that.

04:31.622 --> 04:35.758
Gambled away his money, cheated
on his wife, destroyed his business.

04:35.927 --> 04:37.554
Yes.

04:37.723 --> 04:40.398
- Like a switch had flipped.
- Father, did you know the man...

04:40.565 --> 04:42.693
...who killed those folks
in the hobby shop?

04:42.864 --> 04:44.278
- Sure, Tony Perkins.
- Tony Perkins.

04:44.452 --> 04:45.652
Good man.

04:47.043 --> 04:50.800
Would you say that his personality
suddenly changed one day too?

04:50.972 --> 04:53.384
I never thought about it that way...

04:53.563 --> 04:55.190
...but, yes.

04:55.359 --> 04:57.903
About the same time as Andy,
about two months ago.

05:00.751 --> 05:04.044
Well, thank you, Father.
Appreciate your time.

05:06.978 --> 05:08.939
Two months ago,
we opened up the Devil's Gate...

05:09.109 --> 05:12.533
...all of a sudden this town turns into
Margaritaville? It's no coincidence.

05:29.630 --> 05:30.878
Richie.

05:31.469 --> 05:35.177
- I don't believe it.
- Hey, Dean Winchester, right?

05:35.356 --> 05:37.067
Yeah.
- Yeah.

05:37.236 --> 05:38.865
Oh, um.

05:39.034 --> 05:41.411
This is my sister, uh...

05:41.583 --> 05:42.830
...Cheryl. Heh.

05:43.004 --> 05:44.584
Hey.
- Hi, Cheryl.

05:44.759 --> 05:46.257
Here.

05:51.947 --> 05:54.705
Well, you know, stepsister.

05:55.500 --> 05:57.247
Come on in. This is my brother, Sam.

05:57.422 --> 05:59.253
Hey, how you doing?
Not too bad.

05:59.429 --> 06:01.675
Yeah.
- How do you two know each other?

06:01.853 --> 06:05.109
- You were in school.
- It was that succubus in Canarsie, right?

06:05.279 --> 06:06.563
- Yeah, yeah.
- Oh, man.

06:06.743 --> 06:08.870
You should have seen the rack
on this broad.

06:09.041 --> 06:10.954
Frigging tragedy
when I had to gank her.

06:11.130 --> 06:13.091
Whoa, whoa, wait. Who...?
Who killed her?

06:13.555 --> 06:15.848
I remember your ass was toast
until I showed up.

06:16.020 --> 06:17.648
I forgot what a comedian
this guy was.

06:17.817 --> 06:19.647
Richie, I told you then,
I'll tell you again.

06:21.161 --> 06:23.871
You're not cut out for this job.
You're gonna get yourself killed.

06:24.044 --> 06:25.422
Talk to me.

06:25.591 --> 06:27.635
FYI, Winchester. Words hurt.

06:27.806 --> 06:31.811
Yeah. No, it's not
a good time, baby. Later.

06:31.985 --> 06:33.780
So you find anything
in town anyway?

06:33.949 --> 06:35.946
Oh, no, I got nothing.

06:36.541 --> 06:38.252
Wait, you mean
as in demons and whatnot?

06:38.421 --> 06:40.334
- Yeah.
- Yeah. No, I got nothing.

06:41.012 --> 06:42.094
Typical.

06:42.267 --> 06:44.893
- What about your sister back there?
- Oh, honestly?

06:45.066 --> 06:47.063
She definitely had the devil in her.

06:47.239 --> 06:50.247
But she wasn't no demon.
You know what I'm saying?

06:51.043 --> 06:52.540
Right.

06:52.714 --> 06:56.340
Seriously, church guy, hobby-shop guy,
they were lunch meat...

06:56.518 --> 06:59.691
...by the time I got there. Maybe they
were possessed, but I can't prove it.

06:59.861 --> 07:01.524
Yeah, that's where we are too.

07:01.699 --> 07:05.622
Let's say that demons are possessing
people in town, you know, raising hell...

07:05.796 --> 07:07.626
Why would demon blow
his brains out?

07:07.801 --> 07:10.298
For fun? You know, he wrecks
one body, moves to another.

07:10.477 --> 07:13.817
- Like taking stolen car for a joyride.
- Anybody in town that fits the profile?

07:13.987 --> 07:16.661
- Nice guy turned douche, still breathing?
- There's Trotter.

07:16.828 --> 07:19.408
- Who's that?
- He used to be head of the rotary club.

07:19.587 --> 07:21.964
Then people say he turned bastard
all the sudden.

07:22.136 --> 07:25.310
Brought in the gambling, the hookers.
He practically owns this whole town.

07:25.480 --> 07:29.105
- You know where we could find him?
- Oh, he'll be at his bar in a few hours.

07:45.289 --> 07:47.786
I thought this was some
boarded-up factory town.

07:47.965 --> 07:50.757
It is. Or at least it's supposed to be.

07:50.931 --> 07:53.511
Well, what are we waiting for?
Let's do some research.

08:29.632 --> 08:31.427
Richie, look at you.
- Hey.

08:31.596 --> 08:33.390
- Bringing satin back.
- Oh, you like this?

08:33.559 --> 08:35.605
Try Thai Silk. Canal Street.

08:35.775 --> 08:37.818
You have to pay $300
for threads like these, easy.

08:37.991 --> 08:39.736
Of course, to me? Forget about it.

08:39.913 --> 08:42.789
- How much is "forget about it"?
- Ah, forget about it.

08:42.964 --> 08:44.246
That's Trotter over there.

08:44.427 --> 08:47.683
- He sits there all night. Can't touch him.
- So, what do we do now?

08:47.853 --> 08:50.814
Don't know, but I'm gonna do a little
investigating with that bartender.

08:50.988 --> 08:55.208
Easy. Me and her, we got a little
something-something lined up for later.

08:55.376 --> 08:57.457
- Yeah, right.
- Stings, don't it?

08:58.845 --> 09:02.720
All right, I gotta hit the head.
Release the hostages.

09:02.899 --> 09:04.100
Be back in a few.

09:05.741 --> 09:08.701
No way he gets a girl like that.
I mean, look at her.

09:08.875 --> 09:12.584
- You could fit that ass on a nickel.
- You think so?

09:13.682 --> 09:16.142
Oh, ha, ha. Sorry, Padre.

09:16.314 --> 09:19.357
Knew you boys would find
your way here. They all do.

09:19.533 --> 09:20.994
No offense...

09:21.162 --> 09:23.919
...but what are you doing here,
Father?

09:24.087 --> 09:26.251
Like it or not,
you go where your flock is.

09:26.429 --> 09:28.758
- Plus the clergy drinks for free.
True.

09:28.936 --> 09:31.693
And a certain bartender
owes me a confession.

09:31.862 --> 09:34.108
Not in this lifetime, Father.

09:34.829 --> 09:37.586
I better see your butt on Sunday.

09:39.593 --> 09:42.054
Nickel or no nickel.

09:42.895 --> 09:45.521
- What can I get you boys?
- What's your specialty?

09:45.694 --> 09:47.073
I make a mean hurricane.

09:47.534 --> 09:49.780
I guess we'll see about that.

09:53.887 --> 09:56.097
- You drink hurricanes?
- I do now.

10:00.824 --> 10:02.487
- Hi, John.
Reggie.

10:02.663 --> 10:04.873
- Everything okay with you?
I don't know.

10:05.045 --> 10:08.005
- I'm just not feeling myself today.
- Hey.

10:17.917 --> 10:19.997
Help! Unh.

10:22.640 --> 10:24.683
What are you doing?

10:25.941 --> 10:27.938
He slept with my wife.

10:28.114 --> 10:33.119
- The bastard slept with my wife.
- Somebody call 911.

10:42.240 --> 10:44.036
Behind your back.

10:45.208 --> 10:48.915
- Too many cops here, I say we bolt.
- Just be cool.

10:49.094 --> 10:53.267
Poor jerk. Only thing possessing him
was a sixer of Pabst.

10:53.441 --> 10:56.401
So, what's the deal, then?
People getting possessed or not?

10:56.575 --> 10:59.998
I don't know. Maybe it is just what it is.
A town full of scumbags.

11:00.170 --> 11:03.842
- Yeah, maybe.
You boys ready for your mug shots?

11:05.185 --> 11:09.903
Photographer's gonna be here in a few
and take your picture for the local paper.

11:10.074 --> 11:12.036
Be an honor, officer. What a thrill.

11:14.254 --> 11:16.167
Yup, time to go.

11:16.385 --> 11:18.964
- Wait a second. Wait a second.
- What?

11:19.144 --> 11:20.939
Where's Richie?

11:23.657 --> 11:25.868
So how's a bartender
afford a place like this?

11:26.040 --> 11:28.536
My parents left it to me.

11:29.801 --> 11:32.047
I don't come out here much.

11:32.225 --> 11:34.602
Mostly when I wanna be alone.

11:41.336 --> 11:44.010
Wow, this is, uh, charming.

11:46.225 --> 11:49.102
You sure you wouldn't be
more comfortable in a bedroom?

11:49.276 --> 11:51.237
Or, uh, my motel room?

11:51.407 --> 11:54.284
I mean, not for nothing.
But, you know, I got oils.

11:54.459 --> 11:56.336
But I have toys.

11:58.638 --> 12:01.645
Yeah, no, toys trump oils.

12:05.993 --> 12:08.954
You don't, uh, get scared down here
all by yourself?

12:09.128 --> 12:13.050
Of course not. Not when I've got
a hunter to protect me.

12:33.659 --> 12:35.536
Thanks.

12:36.543 --> 12:39.716
You do realize there's red meat
within striking distance, right?

12:39.886 --> 12:42.596
How many times I gotta tell Richie
he's gonna get in trouble?

12:42.769 --> 12:44.850
Dean, you're assuming he's missing.

12:45.361 --> 12:47.571
- I mean, maybe he just bailed.
- He's a moron.

12:47.743 --> 12:50.535
He's a sweet moron, but he's not
a coward. He wouldn't just bail.

12:50.711 --> 12:52.208
- I gotta go find him.
All right.

12:52.382 --> 12:54.628
Meanwhile, I think I'm gonna trail
this Trotter guy.

12:54.806 --> 12:55.887
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

12:56.059 --> 12:58.936
I don't know. Something about the way
he looked at me last night.

12:59.111 --> 13:01.273
Maybe there is something
going on here.

13:28.909 --> 13:30.240
Cute piece.

13:30.915 --> 13:32.792
- Who are you?
- Won't stop a demon...

13:32.962 --> 13:35.174
...if that's what you think.
- How would you know?

13:35.345 --> 13:37.923
Oh, I don't know.

13:41.196 --> 13:43.240
Call it an educated guess.

13:43.704 --> 13:45.081
Well, ain't I lucky, then?

13:45.835 --> 13:47.416
Found a subject for a test fire.

13:47.925 --> 13:50.635
Luck had nothing to do with it.

13:50.808 --> 13:55.064
But, hey,
by all means, take your best shot.

14:00.128 --> 14:03.968
Are you gonna stand there like
a pantywaist or are you gonna shoot...?

14:06.397 --> 14:07.562
Ouch.

14:09.239 --> 14:10.653
This smarts a little.

14:11.955 --> 14:12.989
What do you want?

14:13.460 --> 14:14.791
Peace on earth.

14:16.804 --> 14:18.349
A new shirt.

14:18.517 --> 14:22.474
Now, do you want me to help you out
with that gun or not?

14:22.654 --> 14:24.152
Hmm?

14:40.709 --> 14:41.992
<i>- Dean.
Sammy.</i>

14:42.171 --> 14:44.252
- Yeah, I can't talk right now.
- You okay?

14:44.429 --> 14:46.591
Yeah, I'm fine.
Just meet me at the bar in 20 minutes.

14:47.981 --> 14:49.098
Sam?

15:07.874 --> 15:09.252
I gotta tell you...

15:09.880 --> 15:12.007
...every woman in this place...

15:12.178 --> 15:14.592
...they wanna eat you up.

15:15.606 --> 15:18.862
Well, hey.
Anybody could've tackled that guy.

15:19.033 --> 15:20.697
And wrestled the gun away.

15:20.872 --> 15:23.165
Prevented mass murder.

15:24.842 --> 15:27.136
Here's what I'm gonna do.

15:27.308 --> 15:29.685
Normally, I charge 400 a night.

15:32.281 --> 15:36.584
Why don't we call it an even deuce
and get the hell out of here?

15:38.843 --> 15:40.007
What do I look like?

15:41.058 --> 15:43.269
What do I look like?

15:43.482 --> 15:45.443
Cheapskate.

15:50.378 --> 15:52.956
Did I just see you strike out
with a prostitute?

15:53.136 --> 15:55.383
- How's that work?
- Told her I had a thing...

15:55.560 --> 15:57.723
...for the bartender.
It was pretty easy.

15:57.900 --> 15:59.897
Who says the bartender's available?

16:00.408 --> 16:01.608
That's a good question.

16:01.787 --> 16:03.618
Got something going with some guy...

16:03.793 --> 16:06.170
...about yay tall, wears a sweat suit?
- Who?

16:06.969 --> 16:08.002
No.

16:08.181 --> 16:11.105
My mistake. What do you say you
and me grab a drink after your shift?

16:11.274 --> 16:13.187
I say, why wait...

16:13.364 --> 16:15.324
...when we can go right now?

16:56.619 --> 16:59.412
What are you doing here?
- I think maybe you know.

16:59.587 --> 17:02.510
Yeah?
Well, I think I'm calling the cops.

17:04.142 --> 17:06.270
- Cops?
- Breaking and entering, assault.

17:06.441 --> 17:08.069
You're in a peck of trouble, my friend.

17:08.238 --> 17:11.446
Uh, well, I think
I could probably explain.

17:11.623 --> 17:13.085
All right, back up.

17:13.503 --> 17:15.464
- Get back.
- Money's in the safe. Take it and go.

17:15.635 --> 17:17.346
I don't want your money.

17:17.515 --> 17:19.512
I just gotta be sure.

17:23.282 --> 17:26.409
- What kind of psycho are you?
- Oh, God.

17:26.584 --> 17:29.260
Uh, I'm sorry. Ha.

17:30.054 --> 17:32.680
I think that this was just a minor
misunderstanding.

17:32.853 --> 17:34.399
Yeah, okay. Um.

17:34.568 --> 17:37.110
How about I just...?
I just leave, because...

17:38.287 --> 17:40.081
I'll take these.

17:40.251 --> 17:43.543
Okay, I'II, uh... I'll leave this for, uh...

17:44.054 --> 17:45.931
...you.

17:46.603 --> 17:48.065
Have a nice day?

18:00.604 --> 18:01.935
Looks like the maid's day off.

18:05.954 --> 18:07.499
Everything okay?

18:14.437 --> 18:16.649
Make yourself comfortable.

18:23.632 --> 18:26.009
Oh, I forgot to mention.

18:26.265 --> 18:28.642
Richie was a friend of mine.

18:31.907 --> 18:37.042
When I realized I could track the GPS
in his cell phone, I swung by earlier.

18:37.214 --> 18:39.295
Gave him a proper burial.

18:39.472 --> 18:42.431
It's better than rotting
in some skank's basement.

18:47.705 --> 18:49.416
Oops.

18:51.340 --> 18:52.719
Isn't that a buzz kill?

18:54.392 --> 18:55.770
Sorry, sister...

18:56.314 --> 18:59.072
...but you're going back
to where you came from.

19:00.911 --> 19:02.112
I don't think so.

19:42.119 --> 19:44.496
What are you laughing at, bitch?
You're still trapped.

19:44.668 --> 19:47.794
So are you. Bitch.

20:07.611 --> 20:08.644
Lose something?

20:12.208 --> 20:13.754
You demons have such smart mouths.

20:13.922 --> 20:15.834
- It's a gift.
- Yeah, well.

20:17.097 --> 20:19.677
Let's see if you're smiling
when I send your ass back to hell.

20:19.856 --> 20:21.353
Without your little exorcism book?

20:21.779 --> 20:23.525
Hey, go ahead.

20:27.504 --> 20:29.085
Having a little trouble there, sport?

20:36.657 --> 20:39.867
Nice try, but I think
you just ordered a pizza.

20:41.714 --> 20:43.960
Guess you should've paid
more attention in Latin class.

20:44.138 --> 20:46.385
I don't know
what you're smiling about.

20:46.562 --> 20:47.810
You're not going anywhere.

20:47.983 --> 20:51.109
And apparently, neither are you.

20:51.284 --> 20:55.956
Yeah, but I got somebody coming for me
and, uh, he did pay attention in class.

20:56.133 --> 20:57.844
Oh, right, Sam.

20:58.013 --> 21:00.307
Everyone says
he's the brains of the outfit.

21:01.984 --> 21:05.156
- Everyone?
- Sure, you Winchester boys are famous.

21:05.327 --> 21:09.000
- Not Lohan famous, but, you know.
- Well, that's flattering.

21:09.172 --> 21:11.299
I'll be sure to let Sam know
when he gets here.

21:12.097 --> 21:13.380
If he shows up first.

21:15.734 --> 21:18.229
What, you thought I was flying solo?

21:18.408 --> 21:21.831
Shouldn't underestimate, Dean.
It might be the death of you.

21:22.588 --> 21:24.299
You can give me hard eyes
all you want...

21:24.468 --> 21:28.058
...but the fact remains, we just have
to wait and see who shows up first.

21:28.229 --> 21:30.856
The cavalry or the Indians.

21:44.821 --> 21:46.984
You look kind of tense.

21:47.788 --> 21:48.905
You know...

21:49.418 --> 21:51.462
...I know a sure-fire way to relax.

21:52.010 --> 21:53.091
Maybe later.

21:54.809 --> 21:56.057
Excuse me?

21:56.230 --> 21:57.478
- Hi.
- What can I get for you?

21:57.652 --> 22:01.954
Um, you remember the guy I was with
last night? We sat right here. Um...

22:02.123 --> 22:05.582
- The big hero who jumped on Reggie.
- Yeah, yeah. The...

22:05.760 --> 22:09.432
The big hero, right. Um, have you
seen him around at all today?

22:09.604 --> 22:12.528
- Maybe, depends.
- Depends on what?

22:14.703 --> 22:15.903
Oh, my...

22:16.082 --> 22:17.960
Does everyone here
have their hand out?

22:19.886 --> 22:22.726
- He left with Casey about an hour ago.
- Any idea where they went?

22:22.894 --> 22:25.937
- Her place, for Bible study.
- All right, you got an address?

22:26.113 --> 22:29.285
What's wrong with you? Think I'm gonna
give you a coworker's address...

22:29.456 --> 22:32.416
...so can you go and get your freaky,
peeping-Tom rocks off?

22:32.591 --> 22:34.837
Corner of Piermont and Clinton.

22:35.014 --> 22:36.726
Have fun.

22:56.078 --> 22:58.121
- Why don't you relax?
- Why don't you kiss my ass?

22:58.293 --> 23:00.421
Why, Dean, you're a poet.
I had no idea.

23:01.511 --> 23:03.923
Look, we won't have any effect
on the outcome of this.

23:04.102 --> 23:05.267
We might as well be civil.

23:07.697 --> 23:10.906
Civil, huh? Killing Richie,
that was...? That was civil?

23:11.082 --> 23:13.208
- Guy was harmless.
- That knife he pulled on me...

23:13.380 --> 23:15.543
...didn't look harmless.
- Wouldn't hurt you.

23:15.721 --> 23:18.098
No, but it would damage this body.

23:18.270 --> 23:20.848
And Casey has such a fine body.
I wouldn't wanna see it ripped.

23:22.366 --> 23:24.327
A demon with a heart. Ah.

23:24.497 --> 23:28.087
Well, there's a bunch of dead people
in town that might disagree with you.

23:28.258 --> 23:31.599
- Hey, I didn't pull any triggers.
- You did something.

23:31.769 --> 23:35.061
You wanna know what I did?
What I really did?

23:36.952 --> 23:39.079
- I had lunch.
- Lunch?

23:39.250 --> 23:42.506
Me and Trotter. He had a cheeseburger.
I had a salad.

23:42.676 --> 23:44.888
And I just pointed out
the money that could be made...

23:45.059 --> 23:47.900
...with a few businesses
that cater to harmless vice.

23:48.068 --> 23:51.325
So Trotter built it
and, man, did they come.

23:51.495 --> 23:57.712
Supposedly God-fearing folk,
waist-deep in booze, sex, gambling.

23:57.890 --> 24:00.220
- I barely lifted a finger.
- That's it?

24:00.397 --> 24:02.060
You don't get it. All you gotta do...

24:02.236 --> 24:04.233
...is nudge humans
in the right direction.

24:04.410 --> 24:06.656
Some whiskey here, a hooker there.

24:06.833 --> 24:10.339
And they'll walk right into hell
with big, fat smiles on their faces.

24:11.765 --> 24:14.891
Your kind is corrupt, Dean. Weak.

24:15.066 --> 24:17.063
Our will is stronger.

24:17.365 --> 24:19.446
That's why we'll win.

24:21.252 --> 24:22.998
And that's how it ends?

24:23.174 --> 24:25.753
No, that's how it begins.

24:42.942 --> 24:44.570
Dean?

25:03.713 --> 25:04.746
Sulfur.

25:04.925 --> 25:07.421
So demons take over?
I thought the meek inherit the earth.

25:07.599 --> 25:09.763
According to your Bible.

25:10.902 --> 25:12.363
It's only a book, Dean.

25:12.531 --> 25:14.943
- Not everyone would agree.
- Because it's God's book?

25:15.959 --> 25:20.677
Do you believe in God, Dean?
I'd be surprised if you did.

25:22.228 --> 25:24.938
I don't know. I'd like to.

25:25.111 --> 25:29.163
Well, I don't see how you and your God
have done such a bang-up job.

25:29.333 --> 25:32.874
War, genocide,
it's only getting worse.

25:33.052 --> 25:35.844
In this past century, you people
racked up a body count...

25:36.019 --> 25:38.562
...that amazed even us.

25:39.195 --> 25:41.026
It's our turn now.

25:41.201 --> 25:43.614
And we're gonna do it right this time.

25:47.930 --> 25:49.593
Don't be hopeful, Dean.

25:49.768 --> 25:51.315
You're not delivered.

25:51.483 --> 25:53.360
It's only the wind.

25:55.118 --> 25:58.791
Bobby, it's Sam. We got a problem.
I found sulfur and now I can't find Dean.

25:58.964 --> 26:02.173
Call me as soon as you get this.
Excuse me. They weren't there.

26:02.683 --> 26:06.439
I guess you gotta catch your jollies
another night. Here.

26:06.612 --> 26:08.822
Why don't you have a drink...

26:08.994 --> 26:11.704
...and relax?
- Yeah, I don't want to relax.

26:11.878 --> 26:16.845
- What is it with the people in this town?
- Suit yourself, princess.

26:28.051 --> 26:29.679
Father.
- Yes?

26:29.848 --> 26:32.855
Um, could I...?
Can I talk to you for a sec?

26:33.025 --> 26:36.234
You're piling it pretty high, sweetheart.
I'm not sure I'm buying.

26:36.410 --> 26:38.037
Why would I lie?

26:38.207 --> 26:39.918
- Demons lie.
- Some do.

26:40.548 --> 26:44.303
- Some are true believers.
- Believers in what?

26:44.476 --> 26:47.852
What, you think humans
have an exclusive on a higher power?

26:50.076 --> 26:52.536
- You have a god?
- Sure. His name's Lucifer.

26:52.709 --> 26:54.504
- You mean the devil?
- Your word, not ours.

26:55.760 --> 26:58.933
Lucifer actually means "light bringer. "
Look it up.

26:59.103 --> 27:02.230
Once, he was the most beautiful
of all God's angels.

27:02.405 --> 27:04.698
But God demanded
that he bow down before man.

27:04.871 --> 27:06.617
And when he refused,
God banished him.

27:07.211 --> 27:10.088
Tell me, Dean, how do you like bowing
before lesser creatures?

27:10.262 --> 27:13.388
- Lucifer's really real?
- Well, no one's actually seen him.

27:13.563 --> 27:16.904
They say that he made us into what
we are. They say that he'll return.

27:17.074 --> 27:20.497
Oh, yeah? And, uh, you believe that?

27:20.668 --> 27:22.415
- I've got faith.
- Mmm.

27:22.591 --> 27:26.846
So you see? Is my kind
really all that different than yours?

27:27.731 --> 27:33.449
- Well, except that, uh, demons are evil.
- And humans are such a lovable bunch.

27:33.624 --> 27:35.121
- Dick Cheney.
- He one of yours?

27:35.296 --> 27:39.718
Not yet. Let's just say he's got a parking
spot reserved for him downstairs.

27:41.439 --> 27:43.566
Hey, speaking of downstairs.

27:45.452 --> 27:47.495
What's it like down there?

27:49.087 --> 27:50.252
What, hell?

27:51.094 --> 27:52.639
Yeah.

27:53.267 --> 27:56.689
That's right. You booked
a one-way ticket with that deal.

27:58.408 --> 27:59.905
You're not gonna like it, Dean.

28:00.706 --> 28:03.713
And, um, judging
from the trouble you've caused...

28:03.882 --> 28:07.008
...I don't think you'll be getting
the presidential suite.

28:08.438 --> 28:10.184
No, it's a pit of despair.

28:10.360 --> 28:12.357
Why do you think
we want to come here?

28:14.039 --> 28:17.082
So the bartender
the other night, Casey.

28:17.257 --> 28:20.800
- You know her pretty well?
- Since she was in pigtails.

28:20.977 --> 28:24.816
Well, um, she and my brother,
they, uh...

28:26.160 --> 28:27.823
They...

28:27.998 --> 28:29.281
...left tonight.

28:30.171 --> 28:31.834
- Together.
- Ahh.

28:32.135 --> 28:33.598
Well...

28:33.766 --> 28:36.523
...not that I approve,
but they are consenting adults.

28:36.983 --> 28:39.526
- Right.
- I'm sorry, you said "brother. "

28:39.700 --> 28:42.279
I thought the two of you
were insurance investigators.

28:42.459 --> 28:46.214
Right. Right, well, we are.
Um, it's like a family business.

28:46.387 --> 28:47.421
You know?

28:47.599 --> 28:51.307
Anyways, um, so I went to Casey's
apartment and they weren't there.

28:51.486 --> 28:53.981
Um, I... I just have
this feeling that they...

28:54.161 --> 28:56.323
That they might be in trouble.

28:56.752 --> 28:59.842
- What kind of trouble?
- Just trouble.

29:00.011 --> 29:01.889
Look, please, Father, I need your help.

29:02.060 --> 29:04.983
Is there anything you can tell me
about Casey? Any place she'd go...?

29:05.152 --> 29:07.065
Yes. There is a place.
Let me get my jacket.

29:07.241 --> 29:09.405
No. I don't wanna put you out.
I can do this.

29:09.582 --> 29:12.958
Son, if Casey's really in trouble,
then there's nothing to talk about.

29:22.914 --> 29:24.577
Shall we go?

29:32.062 --> 29:34.058
Kind of funny, don't you think?

29:34.235 --> 29:36.481
You and me sitting here
like a couple of regular folk.

29:36.658 --> 29:40.664
Yeah, it's hilarious. You know,
in that apocalyptic sort of way.

29:42.509 --> 29:44.006
You're all right, Dean.

29:44.181 --> 29:46.309
The others don't describe you
that way.

29:46.940 --> 29:49.233
But, you know, you're... You're likable.

29:49.405 --> 29:51.402
A demon likes me.

29:51.662 --> 29:55.252
- I don't know how to respond to that.
- You could say thanks.

29:57.220 --> 29:58.848
That deal you made to save Sam?

29:59.938 --> 30:03.693
A lot of others would mock you for it,
think it was weak or stupid.

30:04.116 --> 30:05.779
I don't.

30:10.176 --> 30:12.969
It's been kind of liberating, actually.

30:13.477 --> 30:15.939
And what's the point
in worrying about a future...

30:16.111 --> 30:17.656
...when you don't have one, huh?

30:17.824 --> 30:19.452
Still...

30:19.621 --> 30:21.369
...a year to live.

30:21.544 --> 30:23.541
- You're not scared?
- No.

30:23.717 --> 30:27.140
- Not even a little?
- Of course not.

30:32.494 --> 30:36.084
So insurance investigating, hmm?

30:36.255 --> 30:37.633
You enjoy the work?

30:38.972 --> 30:42.680
Yeah, yeah, I like being able
to help people.

30:42.859 --> 30:45.021
- Ever think about doing anything else?
- Like what?

30:45.199 --> 30:46.779
Hmm, anything.

30:48.667 --> 30:50.331
You seem like a pretty smart kid.

30:50.966 --> 30:54.223
Somehow, I see you out
in front of the pack.

30:55.563 --> 30:57.941
You could do some great things.

31:00.954 --> 31:02.666
I don't know.

31:02.960 --> 31:06.883
- I like doing what I'm doing, I guess.
- Well, it's your life.

31:08.561 --> 31:10.438
Does, um...?

31:10.609 --> 31:11.810
- Dean?
- Yeah, Dean.

31:11.988 --> 31:17.754
- Does he find trouble often?
- Yeah. Yeah, Dean finds his fair share.

31:19.177 --> 31:23.514
Well, it's a good thing he has you.
His brother's keeper.

31:33.428 --> 31:37.730
Why, Dean, if I didn't know better,
I'd say that was lust in your eyes.

31:38.735 --> 31:40.982
Well, that would be one way
to spend the time.

31:41.159 --> 31:43.916
But I don't think you'd respect me
in the morning.

31:44.085 --> 31:46.926
That's okay. I mean, hey,
I barely respect you now.

31:50.813 --> 31:53.144
Hey, can I ask you a question?

31:53.698 --> 31:55.694
I'm an open book.

31:56.790 --> 31:58.703
So the gate opened.

31:58.921 --> 32:02.012
The demon army was let out.
What now? Huh?

32:02.181 --> 32:05.771
- I'm not seeing a big honking plan here.
- Honestly?

32:05.942 --> 32:07.654
There was a plan.

32:07.824 --> 32:09.237
Azazel was a tyrant...

32:09.704 --> 32:12.877
...but he held us all together.

32:13.256 --> 32:14.588
- Azazel?
- What, you think...

32:14.761 --> 32:17.887
...his friends just called him
"Yellow Eyes"? He had a name.

32:18.062 --> 32:21.403
After you did him in, it all fell apart.

32:21.573 --> 32:22.655
Sorry about that.

32:24.290 --> 32:27.166
- So, what, no chain of command?
- There was.

32:27.382 --> 32:29.296
It was Sam.

32:30.015 --> 32:32.975
Sam was supposed to be the
Grand Pooh Bah, lead the big army.

32:33.149 --> 32:37.025
But he hasn't exactly stepped up
to the plate, has he?

32:37.914 --> 32:38.995
Thank God for that.

32:40.254 --> 32:43.797
Again with God?
You think this is a good thing?

32:43.974 --> 32:47.266
Now you've got chaos,
a war without a front.

32:47.443 --> 32:50.320
Hundreds of demons,
all jockeying for power.

32:50.494 --> 32:52.537
All fighting for the crown.

32:52.709 --> 32:54.254
Most of them gunning
for your brother.

32:57.557 --> 32:59.387
For the record...

32:59.813 --> 33:01.525
...I was ready to follow Sam.

33:16.614 --> 33:18.028
Dean!

33:19.874 --> 33:20.955
Looks like you win.

33:23.719 --> 33:25.300
Dean!

33:31.534 --> 33:33.330
Check that way.

33:34.627 --> 33:36.422
Sam.
Dean!

33:36.591 --> 33:38.504
Sammy, down here!
The basement caved in!

33:38.680 --> 33:40.393
Dean, hey, hold on, okay?
We're coming.

33:40.562 --> 33:43.236
- Who's "we"?
- I'm here with the Father.

33:44.448 --> 33:45.731
Sammy, be careful.

34:20.014 --> 34:22.556
Bobby, you all right?

34:22.813 --> 34:24.476
- How did you know where we...?
- Go.

34:29.543 --> 34:31.623
You heard the man. Go.

34:51.275 --> 34:52.391
Stop.

35:21.617 --> 35:22.947
You two?

35:23.121 --> 35:24.534
For centuries.

35:25.546 --> 35:27.875
We've been to hell and back. Literally.

35:28.053 --> 35:29.550
Leave him be.

35:34.113 --> 35:35.776
Don't kill him. Let's just go.

35:39.211 --> 35:40.543
Please.

35:54.341 --> 35:56.004
Sam, wait.

36:18.244 --> 36:19.408
Well, what do you think?

36:19.581 --> 36:22.504
About what we did here.
Do you think it made a difference?

36:22.673 --> 36:24.801
Two less demons to worry about.

36:24.972 --> 36:27.813
- That's not nothing.
- Yeah, but Trotter's still alive.

36:27.981 --> 36:30.394
Humans ain't our job.

36:31.994 --> 36:33.740
You think anything's gonna change?

36:33.916 --> 36:36.875
I mean, maybe these people
do just wanna destroy themselves.

36:37.050 --> 36:39.927
Maybe it is a losing battle.

36:40.603 --> 36:44.775
- That you or that demon girl talking?
- Oh, it's me.

36:44.950 --> 36:48.622
The demon is dead. And so
is that hot girl it was possessing.

36:49.128 --> 36:51.125
Well, had to be done.

36:51.302 --> 36:53.263
Sam was saving your life.

36:53.433 --> 36:55.477
But you didn't see it, Bobby.
He was cold.

36:56.275 --> 36:58.854
- Bobby.
- Yeah.

37:00.078 --> 37:03.454
Back in Wyoming, uh,
there was this moment.

37:03.630 --> 37:05.544
Yellow Eyes said something to me.

37:06.306 --> 37:07.387
What'd he say?

37:11.153 --> 37:13.067
That maybe when...

37:13.243 --> 37:16.701
...Sam came back from...
Well, wherever.

37:18.467 --> 37:20.262
- That maybe he came back different.

37:20.641 --> 37:22.637
- Different how?
- I don't know. Whatever it was...

37:22.814 --> 37:24.608
...it didn't sound good.

37:25.321 --> 37:27.033
You think...?

37:27.787 --> 37:30.117
You think something's wrong
with my brother?

37:31.882 --> 37:35.425
No. Demons lie.

37:35.686 --> 37:37.313
I'm sure Sam's okay.

37:39.447 --> 37:41.194
Yeah.

37:41.746 --> 37:43.159
Yeah, me too.

37:53.071 --> 37:54.188
Leaving so soon?

37:55.454 --> 37:57.784
We haven't even had a chance
to celebrate.

37:58.713 --> 38:00.460
Well, you can celebrate without me.

38:00.636 --> 38:03.560
You're not gonna get
all pouty on me now, are you?

38:03.729 --> 38:06.141
Come on.

38:06.320 --> 38:08.363
You killed two demons today.

38:08.534 --> 38:11.031
Maybe you don't care,
but I killed two humans too.

38:11.210 --> 38:15.084
Sam, you know what happens
when demons piggyback humans.

38:15.263 --> 38:18.187
They leave them rode hard
and put up wet.

38:18.649 --> 38:22.321
Chances are those two would've died
a slow, sticky death.

38:22.493 --> 38:25.287
- You probably did them a favor.
- Did them a favor?

38:26.422 --> 38:27.539
You're a cold bitch.

38:27.718 --> 38:32.473
Yeah, and this cold bitch has saved
your ass a couple of times now.

38:32.649 --> 38:35.359
Some respect might be nice.

38:35.533 --> 38:39.622
Especially if you want me to help
you out with Dean and his little problem.

38:39.796 --> 38:43.967
You know, you keep dangling that, but
last I checked Dean's still going to hell.

38:44.142 --> 38:46.853
Everything in its own time, Sam.

38:47.026 --> 38:49.736
But there's a quid pro quo here.
We're in a war.

38:49.909 --> 38:51.323
Right. But for some reason...

38:51.497 --> 38:54.339
...you're fighting on our team.
Tell me, why is that again?

38:54.507 --> 38:56.170
- Go screw yourself, that's why.
- I see.

38:56.346 --> 38:58.508
I don't have to justify
my actions to you.

38:58.686 --> 39:00.648
If you don't want my help...

39:00.818 --> 39:02.065
...fine.

39:02.239 --> 39:06.079
Then give me the gun, and I'll pass it on
to someone who will use it.

39:06.251 --> 39:07.499
Maybe I'll just use it on you.

39:11.140 --> 39:13.851
Go ahead, if that makes you happy.

39:14.442 --> 39:17.199
It's not gonna do much
for Dean, though.

39:20.252 --> 39:23.592
So, what's it gonna be? Hmm?

39:25.809 --> 39:27.771
Ahh.

39:28.318 --> 39:29.863
That's my boy.

39:31.493 --> 39:33.205
This won't be easy, Sam.

39:33.374 --> 39:37.082
You're gonna have to do things that go
against that gentle nature of yours.

39:37.261 --> 39:40.053
There'll be collateral damage.

39:41.147 --> 39:43.441
- But it has to be done.
- I don't have to like it.

39:43.906 --> 39:45.569
No.

39:46.204 --> 39:48.784
You wouldn't be Sam if you did.

39:50.551 --> 39:52.714
But on the bright side...

39:52.891 --> 39:54.638
...I'll be there with you.

39:56.110 --> 39:58.867
That little fallen angel
on your shoulder.
