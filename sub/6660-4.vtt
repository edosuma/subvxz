00:16.951 --> 00:19.287
Why on earth am I spending
my lunch break

00:19.288 --> 00:21.055
at the great governor
Chung's book launch?

00:21.056 --> 00:23.124
Because it's better
than watching Gary drip

00:23.125 --> 00:25.126
that fucking noodle juice
down his chin.

00:25.127 --> 00:27.495
God, I'm gonna snort
a line of tzatziki and go.

00:27.496 --> 00:30.331
I am so mired in filibuster reform,
I've got no conversation.

00:30.332 --> 00:32.533
- Do you know Chung?
- Not really.

00:32.534 --> 00:34.635
- Heh-hey!
- Dan, my man.

00:34.636 --> 00:36.804
Governor.
Good to see you, my friend.

00:36.805 --> 00:38.272
- How are you, sir?
- I'm very well.

00:38.273 --> 00:40.041
- Oh, and you must be Amy.
- Yes.

00:40.042 --> 00:42.076
So, Dan, how's it working
out with the V.P.?

00:42.077 --> 00:44.413
'Cause if you ever wanna step
several rungs down the ladder,

00:44.414 --> 00:46.214
I could always use help
from a fellow Daniel.

00:46.215 --> 00:48.082
Dan only climbs up ladders.

00:48.083 --> 00:51.752
Yes, but sometimes you
have to go down to go up.

00:53.155 --> 00:55.090
I assume the vice president
would be too busy.

00:55.091 --> 00:56.592
Yes. She sends
her apologies.

00:56.593 --> 00:58.527
<i>- She's prepping for "Meet the Press."
- Ah.</i>

00:58.528 --> 01:00.297
I'll be on
"Face the Nation."

01:00.298 --> 01:03.233
But everyone will be watching her,
so I guess I can just wing it.

01:03.234 --> 01:05.468
- Shall I sign a book for her?
- No... 'kay.

01:05.470 --> 01:08.172
I'd better be
going around myself,

01:08.173 --> 01:10.809
make sure everyone gets to
touch the hem of my garment.

01:10.810 --> 01:12.644
Dan, the man.

01:12.645 --> 01:14.679
All right.

01:14.680 --> 01:16.414
"You have to go down
to go up."

01:16.415 --> 01:18.918
<i>- What a jerk.
- I'm gonna steal that,</i>

01:18.919 --> 01:22.287
because he who speaks
in maxims.

01:22.288 --> 01:24.289
Can sound wise.

01:24.290 --> 01:26.958
This is good.
This is like cornbread.

01:26.959 --> 01:28.793
Hello, children.

01:28.794 --> 01:32.230
- Hello, senator.
- You looking for some fresh backs to stab?

01:32.231 --> 01:35.166
Oh, senator Doyle,
it's all part of the game.

01:35.167 --> 01:37.569
Yeah, well, I'll tell you,
you wanna play a game, Danny?

01:37.570 --> 01:40.973
Why don't you try working
an iPad with your dick?

01:40.974 --> 01:43.943
No, he's already got
carpal tunnel in that area.

01:43.944 --> 01:46.579
You have nothing constructive
to say to me, Amy?

01:46.580 --> 01:48.181
Is this about clean jobs?

01:48.182 --> 01:51.051
Oh, is that what they call it
still with two oil guys on it?

01:51.052 --> 01:55.122
Wow, you're gonna have to buy a lot of
spray cans to paint that turd gold.

01:55.123 --> 01:58.325
Everyone has limits to their power,
senator, even the vice president.

01:58.326 --> 02:01.295
Yeah, and I have
the power to withdraw,

02:01.296 --> 02:05.966
which is what
I'm gonna do right now.

02:05.967 --> 02:08.134
When he said withdraw,
he's... he's not talking about

02:08.136 --> 02:10.204
withdrawing from filibuster
reform, though, right?

02:10.205 --> 02:12.639
- No! No!
- What do you think he's talking about?

02:12.640 --> 02:15.409
I assumed it was withdraw
from the conversation.

02:15.410 --> 02:16.977
Who uses withdraw
as a fuckin' verb

02:16.978 --> 02:18.713
besides catholics and butlers?

02:18.714 --> 02:20.681
Maybe the Israeli military
every once in a while.

02:20.682 --> 02:22.517
Yeah, you think I don't know?
You're fucking with me.

02:22.518 --> 02:24.520
No. Come on,
let's just head back.

02:24.521 --> 02:26.522
Oh, no, no. No way.
I'm staying right here.

02:26.523 --> 02:28.290
You gotta network
to get work, baby.

02:28.291 --> 02:29.959
All right?
Chung for change.

02:32.296 --> 02:34.831
Thank you.
Thank you so much.

02:34.832 --> 02:36.566
<i>We've got jobs.</i>

02:36.567 --> 02:37.968
- Clean jobs.
- Clean jobs.

02:37.969 --> 02:39.736
Filibuster reform.

02:39.737 --> 02:41.571
- Yeah, hit that hard.
- Right. You know what we need?

02:41.572 --> 02:43.535
We need some normal,
regular-people stuff.

02:43.536 --> 02:44.708
I got an idea.

02:44.709 --> 02:46.710
You could talk about
how you always get

02:46.711 --> 02:48.746
a sweaty upper lip
underneath studio lights.

02:48.747 --> 02:50.147
That shows you're normal.

02:50.148 --> 02:53.151
I'm really talking about a
different kind of normal, Gary.

02:53.152 --> 02:54.244
Oh, okay.

02:54.245 --> 02:55.687
Small talk's gonna happen
at the end, right?

02:55.688 --> 02:57.189
- Right.
- Gregory's a redskins fan.

02:57.190 --> 02:59.292
- He'll probably bring up football.
- Football.

02:59.293 --> 03:01.928
And I am a...

03:01.929 --> 03:04.130
Ravens fan, so...

03:04.131 --> 03:06.666
Madam vice president, how are
your Ravens doing this year?

03:06.667 --> 03:09.169
My Ravens are gold
and I'll tell you why.

03:09.170 --> 03:12.473
Because we have Joe Flacco
as our quarterback.

03:12.474 --> 03:14.408
<i>- Yes, yes.
- And...</i>

03:14.409 --> 03:16.476
<i>Well, the redskins have
a great running game this year</i>

03:16.477 --> 03:18.511
and, honestly, that
receiving corps over there,

03:18.512 --> 03:21.081
Anquan Boldin,
not looking good for you.

03:21.082 --> 03:22.816
Anquan?

03:22.817 --> 03:24.251
A receiver on the Ravens.

03:24.252 --> 03:26.386
Okay, well, I'm not
gonna remember that.

03:26.387 --> 03:27.854
<i>- That's not good.
- It doesn't matter.</i>

03:27.855 --> 03:29.855
You wanna bet a beer
that the Ravens will win.

03:29.856 --> 03:32.758
- Beer makes me so gassy.
- You can talk about that...

03:32.759 --> 03:34.259
about how it always
bloats you, beer.

03:34.260 --> 03:36.362
- Uh-huh!
- Uh-huh!

03:36.363 --> 03:38.197
- That's a good one.
- How was Chung?

03:38.198 --> 03:40.033
Did he do this thing
where you don't know

03:40.034 --> 03:41.968
if you're supposed to
hug him or crucify him?

03:41.969 --> 03:43.804
Which, by the way,
makes me wanna crucify him.

03:43.805 --> 03:45.906
- I did not stay for his speech.
- Let me see this.

03:45.907 --> 03:47.475
"The Good Fight."

03:47.476 --> 03:50.311
- I know. The title...
- Puh-lease! Sue?

03:50.312 --> 03:51.646
- Yep.
- Handle this for me.

03:51.647 --> 03:53.281
<i>- Do you want me to shred it?
- Yeah.</i>

03:53.282 --> 03:55.149
- Should I fire up the shit eater?
- Yeah.

03:55.150 --> 03:56.584
No, no.
Wait a second.

03:56.585 --> 03:58.786
He scrawled something
in the front for you.

03:58.787 --> 04:03.024
"To vice president
Salina Meyer"...

04:03.025 --> 04:06.460
with an "a"...
"from an admiring wannabe."

04:06.461 --> 04:09.062
What an e-hole.

04:09.063 --> 04:10.497
Changed the "a"
to an "e."

04:10.498 --> 04:12.566
What a bunch of Washington
bullshit that is.

04:12.567 --> 04:15.602
I am so tired of...
hey, Gary, I...

04:15.603 --> 04:18.072
I mean, wannabe?

04:18.072 --> 04:19.940
He's obviously
making a joke, right?

04:19.940 --> 04:21.809
He doesn't really think
that he's some sort

04:21.810 --> 04:24.311
of credible vice
presidential candidate.

04:24.312 --> 04:26.548
Mm, charismatic war hero.

04:26.549 --> 04:29.017
Yeah, but,
I mean, the president

04:29.018 --> 04:31.119
always sticks with
the incumbent veep.

04:31.120 --> 04:34.556
Plus, he doesn't wanna look like he
made a massive error picking you.

04:34.557 --> 04:37.626
Well, that was lovely.

04:37.627 --> 04:39.828
- He's stuck with me... is that what...
- I don't mean it like that.

04:39.829 --> 04:43.098
I meant good stuck, like if your
marriage lasts or whatever.

04:43.099 --> 04:44.632
The president's
not gonna ditch you.

04:44.633 --> 04:47.102
Would you be quiet?
What...?

04:47.103 --> 04:49.704
Want me to have Scott put
together a file on Chung,

04:49.705 --> 04:51.740
- given the noise?
- No. No, no, no, no.

04:51.741 --> 04:54.075
Do not let him know that you're
worried, do not make it a thing.

04:54.076 --> 04:56.777
- Yeah, Amy, don't make it a thing, okay?
- Okay.

04:58.313 --> 05:00.681
Ame?

05:00.682 --> 05:05.085
Although, if those wheels
are in motion anyway,

05:05.086 --> 05:08.055
then I would say
go ahead and, you know,

05:08.056 --> 05:11.825
put a file together, you know.

05:11.826 --> 05:13.393
You know what I'm sick of?

05:13.394 --> 05:16.730
That stupid story of Chung supposedly
pulling some guy out of a burning tank.

05:16.731 --> 05:20.768
Come on, why do guys in the army
get a medal for doing their job?

05:20.769 --> 05:22.203
The guy still had severe burns.

05:22.204 --> 05:24.539
If anything,
Chung was too late.

05:24.540 --> 05:26.708
Whoa, whoa.
Your desk is in the back.

05:26.709 --> 05:29.845
- This is neutral territory.
- Yep. So I'm claiming it.

05:29.846 --> 05:31.747
Sue, would you like to tell him
about the encroachment rules?

05:31.748 --> 05:33.949
Do I look like a kindergarten
teacher to you, Mike?

05:33.950 --> 05:35.651
- Actually, yes.
- Excuse me?

05:35.652 --> 05:38.287
Uh, no, you don't.
Okay, go ahead.

05:38.288 --> 05:41.322
- I'm gonna use your desk in the back.
- As what, a pantry?

05:41.323 --> 05:44.125
Oh, here we go.

05:44.126 --> 05:47.695
Look who it is, everybody!
It's your favorite Jonah.

05:47.696 --> 05:50.330
<i>You're not even your
mom's favorite Jonah, Jonah.</i>

05:50.331 --> 05:52.866
Don't be changing the talking points
for my "Meet the Press" thing.

05:52.867 --> 05:54.632
Okay? I am prepped.

05:54.633 --> 05:57.270
I come bearing a very minor request
from the president.

05:57.271 --> 05:59.906
Does he want to operate me
by remote control?

05:59.907 --> 06:03.311
No. That's not
technologically possible.

06:03.312 --> 06:05.880
Um, potus would appreciate it

06:05.881 --> 06:07.949
if you didn't go too hard
on filibuster reform.

06:07.950 --> 06:09.551
What are you talking about?

06:09.552 --> 06:11.787
That's my defining
vice presidential crusade.

06:11.788 --> 06:15.158
The administration is totally
focused on the economy.

06:15.159 --> 06:16.692
- Have a great weekend, okay?
- Ma'am.

06:16.693 --> 06:18.093
<i>- Ma'am, you, too.
- Yeah, thank you very much.</i>

06:18.094 --> 06:19.762
- Ma'am.
- I need to gather my things.

06:19.763 --> 06:21.463
I'll tell you something else...
these need water, okay?

06:21.464 --> 06:22.898
<i>- Got it.
- Okay.</i>

06:22.899 --> 06:25.900
So, ma'am, potus would like
your new chosen subject

06:25.901 --> 06:27.669
to be immigration reform...

06:27.670 --> 06:29.938
Americans losing jobs
to illegals, et cetera.

06:29.939 --> 06:33.375
I spoke in favor
of immigration amnesty

06:33.376 --> 06:34.910
all during my primary campaign.

06:34.911 --> 06:36.945
- Hey, how's it going?
- Well, with respect, ma'am,

06:36.946 --> 06:40.248
do you think anybody's gonna
remember your primary campaign?

06:40.249 --> 06:41.950
Ooh.

06:41.951 --> 06:44.619
In spite of your preface,
I did not detect

06:44.620 --> 06:46.688
a whole lot of respect
in that question.

06:46.689 --> 06:50.758
You know, I meant that
more as a slight against

06:50.759 --> 06:52.527
the power of recollection
of the electorate

06:52.528 --> 06:54.795
and not as an attack on the
potency of your campaign.

06:54.796 --> 06:56.563
Well, why didn't
you say that, then?

06:56.564 --> 07:00.234
Oh, because you have the social skills
of someone who was raised by wolves.

07:00.235 --> 07:03.337
Oh, and pump up China
as a trading partner.

07:03.338 --> 07:05.706
We gotta keep nudging
that one along.

07:05.707 --> 07:07.875
I gotta get back
to the White House.

07:07.876 --> 07:09.977
God, I love saying that.

07:09.978 --> 07:13.547
Well, God bless
the president, you know.

07:13.548 --> 07:15.149
I mean, he's really
a great man,

07:15.150 --> 07:18.386
but he is busting
my fuckin' lady balls here.

07:18.387 --> 07:21.322
And pump up China?

07:21.323 --> 07:24.292
Is that some sort
of dig about Chung?

07:24.293 --> 07:26.194
Okay, so I guess
we're not going home.

07:26.195 --> 07:27.796
<i>- Yeah. Sue?
- Yep.</i>

07:27.797 --> 07:30.332
- We're staying.
- Aw.

07:30.333 --> 07:31.934
Whew.

07:33.970 --> 07:36.871
- Did you have a good Saturday night?
- It was okay.

07:36.872 --> 07:39.174
My zipper
on my Leviathan broke,

07:39.175 --> 07:41.776
so I had to drive around
trying to find a replacement.

07:41.777 --> 07:42.794
What did you do?

07:42.795 --> 07:45.046
You know what I did?
I went to bed at 7:00 P.M.

07:45.047 --> 07:47.214
- Ooh.
- 7:00 P.M. on a Saturday night.

07:47.215 --> 07:49.550
Even people who are dying of
malaria stay up later than that.

07:49.551 --> 07:51.885
Well, they can't sleep
because they're coughing.

07:51.886 --> 07:54.054
Hi, guys. I'm all set.
I'll be there in just a second.

07:54.055 --> 07:55.622
- Okay, yeah. Yeah, yeah.
- All right.

07:55.623 --> 07:57.024
I gotta go, but you know what?

07:57.025 --> 07:58.558
Hang out here
as long as you like

07:58.559 --> 07:59.726
<i>and I'll call you
afterwards, okay?</i>

07:59.727 --> 08:01.095
<i>Can't I just
leave now with you?</i>

08:01.096 --> 08:02.763
<i>No, I don't
want them to see you.</i>

08:02.764 --> 08:04.198
All these extra rules...
it's kind of weird.

08:04.199 --> 08:06.100
I know, but I am
the vice president.

08:06.101 --> 08:08.070
<i>Oh, yes, you are.</i>

08:08.071 --> 08:11.740
<i>Hearing you say that
gives me a massive hard-on.</i>

08:11.741 --> 08:14.677
<i>Oh.
I am the vice president.</i>

08:14.678 --> 08:19.281
Oh, baby,
I'm ready to launch.

08:19.282 --> 08:21.416
And I'm ready to eat you up.

08:21.417 --> 08:22.817
<i>Oh, second breakfast.</i>

08:22.818 --> 08:24.318
<i>I didn't know
you had it in you.</i>

08:24.319 --> 08:26.787
<i>Oh, God.
Oh, I want it in me.</i>

08:26.788 --> 08:28.355
<i>- All right.
- Bye.</i>

08:28.356 --> 08:30.456
Yeah. I'm gonna watch
your ass move.

08:30.457 --> 08:31.724
Yeah.

08:31.725 --> 08:33.525
<i>- Hi, you guys.
- Hey.</i>

08:33.527 --> 08:36.261
- You look pretty.
- Oh, thank you.

08:36.263 --> 08:38.331
<i>- How are you guys?
- Great.</i>

08:38.332 --> 08:41.001
- All set? You got everything?
- Oh, yes.

08:41.001 --> 08:44.038
- I just have to get my stuff.
- How was your Saturday night?

08:44.039 --> 08:45.506
Um, it was fine.

08:45.507 --> 08:47.475
- Here, I'll get that.
- Thank you.

08:49.412 --> 08:51.880
- Mike!
- Oh, hey.

08:51.881 --> 08:55.117
Just visualizing you kicking
ass on "Meet the Press."

08:55.118 --> 08:57.920
Why are you so tired?
You don't do anything.

09:01.291 --> 09:04.961
Here's the research
Scott pulled on Chung.

09:04.962 --> 09:06.828
Check out page one.

09:06.829 --> 09:09.965
He was born back in China before
his dad got his citizenship,

09:09.966 --> 09:12.901
so he can't be president
or vice president.

09:12.902 --> 09:14.969
<i>- Really?
- Mm-hmm.</i>

09:14.970 --> 09:16.537
Well, that's good news.

09:16.538 --> 09:18.606
- More good news for "Meet the Press."
- Oh, yeah?

09:18.607 --> 09:20.241
<i>David Gregory is ill.</i>

09:20.242 --> 09:23.711
<i>- Sam Finnegan is the fill-in.
- Ho ho, a virgin.</i>

09:23.712 --> 09:27.114
Oh, God, I'm gonna eat him up.

09:27.115 --> 09:28.983
What?

09:28.984 --> 09:32.921
<i>- Well, that changes the sports stuff.
- No panic.</i>

09:32.922 --> 09:35.924
We'll just change the redskins
to whatever Finnegan's team is.

09:35.925 --> 09:38.227
- What is Finnegan's team?
- I'm pretty sure he's a Bears fan.

09:38.228 --> 09:40.162
- Pretty sure?
- Mike, you're pretty sure?

09:40.163 --> 09:41.764
Exactly.
That doesn't help.

09:41.765 --> 09:43.400
It doesn't matter because you're
gonna talk about the Ravens.

09:43.401 --> 09:45.302
I know that I'm a Ravens fan,

09:45.303 --> 09:48.972
but, like, what if Finnegan
is a Ravens fan, too, you know?

09:48.973 --> 09:51.075
A team can't
play itself, can it?

09:51.076 --> 09:52.843
You can in video games.

09:52.844 --> 09:56.480
Some people say
your immigration policy

09:56.481 --> 09:58.349
is at odds
with your jobs program.

09:58.350 --> 09:59.750
How would you respond to that?

09:59.751 --> 10:01.752
Well, I would
respond like this...

10:01.753 --> 10:05.421
I would say that the economy
has changed a great deal

10:05.422 --> 10:07.924
since I made those statements

10:07.925 --> 10:09.925
and the president and I agree

10:09.926 --> 10:12.894
that Americans
have to come first.

10:12.895 --> 10:15.029
That's my girl.
Olympic-style backflip.

10:15.030 --> 10:17.065
And I believe very strongly...

10:17.066 --> 10:20.035
- That's sweat. That's lip sweat.
- That's shimmer.

10:20.036 --> 10:23.906
You haven't spoken much today about
the Senate filibuster reform.

10:23.907 --> 10:27.376
Well, I'll say this...
in order to reform,

10:27.377 --> 10:29.445
you have to perform.

10:29.446 --> 10:31.213
She got the filibuster in!

10:31.214 --> 10:32.915
Just waiting for Jonah.
Here he is.

10:32.916 --> 10:34.484
Oh, yeah?

10:34.485 --> 10:36.719
Hello, penis
enlargement clinic.

10:36.720 --> 10:38.755
Mike, who is incompetent,
you or her?

10:38.756 --> 10:41.057
Because she just talked
about filibuster reform.

10:41.058 --> 10:42.458
He asked her.

10:42.459 --> 10:46.329
My message is simple,
my message is this... Yes.

10:46.330 --> 10:48.531
<i>- Thank you, madam vice president.
- Absolutely.</i>

10:48.532 --> 10:50.500
Sam, I just have to ask you...
you're a Bears fan.

10:50.501 --> 10:52.102
- Is that right?
- Guilty.

10:52.103 --> 10:53.970
- She do the sports yet?
- She's doing it now.

10:53.971 --> 10:56.907
We're not nervous at all.
With Flacco... forget about it.

10:56.908 --> 10:59.442
I'll bet you a beer
that we win by a T.D.

10:59.443 --> 11:01.912
What about Ray Rice?
Hell of a lead runner.

11:01.913 --> 11:05.347
Ray Rice, Ray Rice, Ray...

11:05.348 --> 11:08.851
Well, he, uh...
Ray Rice, he play nice.

11:08.852 --> 11:10.419
Ooh.

11:10.420 --> 11:11.887
<i>- Vice president.
- Thank you so much.</i>

11:11.888 --> 11:13.823
We'll be back next week,

11:13.824 --> 11:16.692
because if it's Sunday,
it's "Meet the Press."

11:18.494 --> 11:20.729
Will you be watching Danny Chung
on "Face the Nation"?

11:20.730 --> 11:23.232
Uh, you know, I would,

11:23.233 --> 11:25.200
but I've got a game
of solitaire going on,

11:25.201 --> 11:26.868
so I think I'll give
that a skip.

11:26.869 --> 11:28.971
Long-term beltway
money's on him

11:28.972 --> 11:30.973
<i>- as presidential material.
- Oh, really?</i>

11:30.974 --> 11:34.711
Well, I'd be surprised because
technically he's not an American.

11:34.712 --> 11:38.014
I mean, because he
wasn't, um, born here,

11:38.015 --> 11:41.418
you know, not because
he's half Chine...

11:43.354 --> 11:45.089
- You know, 'cause his parents...
- Well, I've gotta go.

11:45.090 --> 11:46.657
- Okay.
- But it was a pleasure talking to you.

11:46.658 --> 11:48.860
Thank you so much.
Did you get it?

11:48.861 --> 11:51.296
- I got it.
- Oh...

11:51.297 --> 11:53.064
Um...

11:53.065 --> 11:54.966
Listen, they wouldn't
have recorded that, right?

11:54.967 --> 11:56.901
I had the mic on, but I
don't think it was hot.

11:56.902 --> 11:59.136
- Do you think that it was on?
- I hope to God they didn't.

11:59.137 --> 12:02.906
I didn't say he was bad
because he's part Chinese.

12:02.907 --> 12:05.008
- No, no.
- It's not bad to be Chinese.

12:05.009 --> 12:06.476
Can you go speak
to the sound guy?

12:06.477 --> 12:08.678
I can't do it because it'll
make it look like a thing.

12:08.679 --> 12:10.613
I don't wanna make it
look like a thing,

12:10.614 --> 12:12.414
- so maybe I can...
- I'll do it.

12:12.415 --> 12:13.582
No, no, no.
Gary, Gary, Gary.

12:13.583 --> 12:15.751
- Gary, come.
- I'll do it.

12:15.752 --> 12:18.154
I think actually he should
go talk to the sound guy.

12:18.155 --> 12:19.589
- Yeah.
- Okay.

12:19.590 --> 12:21.257
Do you have any ideas
on what I should say?

12:21.258 --> 12:23.426
You offered to do this.
What was your plan?

12:23.427 --> 12:25.596
My plan was to go over there and
get some ideas on what to say.

12:25.597 --> 12:28.166
Gary, Gary, just give
it a light touch.

12:28.167 --> 12:30.268
- No import to it.
- Okay.

12:30.269 --> 12:32.838
- What does that mean?
- Just talk to him

12:32.839 --> 12:35.073
like working guy
to working guy.

12:35.074 --> 12:37.809
<i>- It's casual.
- Got it. Mano a mano.</i>

12:37.810 --> 12:40.445
- Okay.
- Oh, Jesus Christ.

12:40.446 --> 12:44.382
Even in Spanish, you know, it
doesn't sound like it's gonna work.

12:44.383 --> 12:47.017
It totally might have
just been me,

12:47.018 --> 12:50.220
but kind of... didn't it
sound a little glitchy

12:50.221 --> 12:51.788
in the end
or anything like that?

12:51.789 --> 12:55.391
- You saying I can't do my job?
- No. Oh, God, no.

12:55.392 --> 12:56.486
It's bad?

12:56.487 --> 12:59.095
Well, he just went from a smiley guy
to a frowny guy.

12:59.096 --> 13:01.731
I just need to know if
everything's okay, you know.

13:01.732 --> 13:05.236
Working guy to working
guy, you know.

13:05.237 --> 13:07.905
- Listen, working girl.
- Okay.

13:07.906 --> 13:10.175
Yeah. I didn't hear
any glitches.

13:10.176 --> 13:14.512
All I heard was the sound
of a fuckup, okay?

13:14.513 --> 13:16.948
- Sending Gary over there was crazy.
- Yeah.

13:16.949 --> 13:18.883
- He was completely out of his element.
- Yeah.

13:18.884 --> 13:21.786
I agree.
I agree.

13:21.787 --> 13:23.955
Hey, we're getting some press
interest in this already.

13:23.956 --> 13:25.924
- Oh, God.
- Where? Where?

13:25.925 --> 13:27.725
<i>It's still non-narrative.
No momentum yet.</i>

13:27.726 --> 13:30.394
Ma'am, I thought you might want me in
the office, given the circumstances.

13:30.395 --> 13:32.729
<i>- How do you know about the circumstances?
- Well, I'm Sue.</i>

13:32.730 --> 13:34.431
It's my job to know
everything, Amy.

13:34.432 --> 13:35.932
So it's definitely
out there out there?

13:35.933 --> 13:37.300
No, no, it's not
out there out there.

13:37.301 --> 13:39.402
I heard about it, Dan, so it
sort of is out there out there.

13:39.403 --> 13:41.104
That's why I'm in here
in here, Dan.

13:41.105 --> 13:42.772
- Jonah's coming. Jonah's coming.
- Oh, fuck!

13:42.773 --> 13:44.641
- Shh!
- All right, what do I do?

13:44.642 --> 13:46.543
What if he doesn't know that it's
not definitely out there out there?

13:46.544 --> 13:47.573
Should I tell him that?

13:47.574 --> 13:49.112
You don't wanna give a loaded gun
to that walking silo.

13:49.113 --> 13:51.015
- Don't make it a thing until it's a thing.
- Do you have any...

13:51.016 --> 13:53.265
Bad news, everyone.

13:53.266 --> 13:55.237
This hasn't hit the mainstream media
yet...

13:55.238 --> 13:56.187
It was out of context.

13:56.188 --> 13:59.190
But a crane has collapsed onto
a ship at Portsmouth, Virginia.

13:59.191 --> 14:00.892
Oh, thank...

14:00.893 --> 14:02.493
God, how horrible.

14:02.494 --> 14:03.928
Wait, what was out of context?

14:03.929 --> 14:05.831
Um, we thought you were gonna

14:05.832 --> 14:07.799
give me shit about
filibuster reform.

14:07.800 --> 14:10.236
Oh, well, the White House
is very much under the moon

14:10.237 --> 14:12.405
about that, but let's reboot.

14:12.406 --> 14:14.407
The president is stuck
in economic talks.

14:14.408 --> 14:17.042
- We need a V.P.V.P.
- A what?

14:17.043 --> 14:18.643
A vice presidential
visual presence.

14:18.644 --> 14:20.612
You can't just make up
acronyms, Jonah.

14:20.613 --> 14:22.147
- Somebody has to, Mike.
- No, they don't.

14:22.148 --> 14:24.182
Uh, okay, well, then,
we should head on down there.

14:24.183 --> 14:26.284
- Let's get the ball rolling.
- Thank you. Thank you.

14:26.285 --> 14:28.252
Yeah,
we've got it handled.

14:28.253 --> 14:30.987
Oh, Jonah,
that's a good look for you.

14:30.988 --> 14:32.789
What do you call that?
Bi-casual?

14:32.790 --> 14:34.757
Thanks, Mike, but it's Sunday.

14:34.758 --> 14:36.693
I work hard, I work fast,
and I get hot legs.

14:36.694 --> 14:38.428
I say let the whale hang loose.

14:38.429 --> 14:40.397
- Who am I offending?
- Show of hands.

14:40.398 --> 14:41.865
Right here.

14:41.866 --> 14:46.036
O-kay, well, I think
that worked out pretty good.

14:46.037 --> 14:47.872
Just confirmed...

14:47.873 --> 14:50.307
Two fatalities,
24 injured so far.

14:50.308 --> 14:52.676
I didn't mean it like that.

14:52.677 --> 14:54.478
Dan, we're going to a hospital.

14:54.479 --> 14:56.346
Do you have a suit
you can change into?

14:56.347 --> 14:57.948
- I have five.
- Okay.

14:57.949 --> 14:59.716
Do you have something
that can fit

14:59.717 --> 15:03.186
the McClintock shape
that's not a Santa suit?

15:03.187 --> 15:04.588
I got something.

15:04.589 --> 15:06.390
We're going to a hospital.

15:06.391 --> 15:08.525
We're not going
trick or treating.

15:15.700 --> 15:17.067
Hi, Ashley.
Mike McClintock,

15:17.068 --> 15:18.268
- vice president's office.
- Oh, hi.

15:18.269 --> 15:19.803
- Madam vice president...
- Yes.

15:19.804 --> 15:21.939
This is Ashley,
the hospital administrator.

15:21.940 --> 15:24.274
Thank you so much for coming.
It really means a lot.

15:24.275 --> 15:26.010
- Thank you.
- Well, let me tell you something...

15:26.011 --> 15:27.177
being here for
the American people

15:27.178 --> 15:28.778
is one of the privileges
of this job.

15:28.779 --> 15:30.347
- It's a sad privilege, of course...
- Yes.

15:30.348 --> 15:32.516
But it's a privilege
nonetheless.

15:32.517 --> 15:34.685
Ma'am, I don't know if all
these people are bereaving,

15:34.686 --> 15:37.136
- so just converse generally, okay?
- Right.

15:37.137 --> 15:39.174
Converse generally? What about?
The weather?

15:39.175 --> 15:40.190
Not about the weather.

15:40.191 --> 15:43.026
It is unseasonably warm,
though, okay?

15:43.027 --> 15:45.428
So, madam vice president,
if you'll just come with me,

15:45.429 --> 15:47.131
I'll show you
to some of our families.

15:47.132 --> 15:48.966
Oh, well, however
I can be of service.

15:48.967 --> 15:50.000
How do you do, sir?

15:50.001 --> 15:52.103
Oh, my goodness,
you got so hurt.

15:52.104 --> 15:54.171
- Well, it's a great hospital, isn't it?
- Yes, ma'am.

15:54.172 --> 15:55.773
Oh, dear, look at your neck.

15:55.774 --> 15:58.076
<i>Hi, sir.
Don't turn your head.</i>

15:58.077 --> 16:00.212
I'll give you a little
squeeze on your hand.

16:00.213 --> 16:03.049
- Well, you seem just fine.
- I'm not really.

16:03.050 --> 16:06.086
- Internal.
- Internal. Hmm.

16:06.087 --> 16:08.688
This is a family... they're
waiting to hear about their son.

16:08.689 --> 16:10.624
- Oh.
- Hold on. No, no, not yet.

16:10.625 --> 16:12.693
This is a private moment.
This is not a photo op.

16:12.694 --> 16:15.562
- It's amazing how the world changes.
- Mm.

16:15.563 --> 16:19.099
One minute, you're enjoying
this amazing sunshine...

16:19.100 --> 16:22.269
Well, it's unseasonably warm.

16:22.270 --> 16:25.305
And the next, your whole
world's gone to pieces.

16:25.306 --> 16:27.774
- Oh, gosh.
- This is his surgeon.

16:27.775 --> 16:30.143
- How do you do, sir?
- Dr. Graber.

16:30.144 --> 16:31.812
Any news, doctor,
about our son?

16:31.813 --> 16:34.280
Sam's going to make it.

16:34.281 --> 16:37.350
Okay, guys, I got a little sound bite
for y'all to nibble on right here.

16:37.351 --> 16:40.186
<i>- Oh, that is just fantastic.
- Very good.</i>

16:40.187 --> 16:41.988
Doctor, we appreciate
your hard work.

16:41.989 --> 16:45.492
<i>- Good news.
- I just wanna say how grateful we are</i>

16:45.493 --> 16:49.530
to all of our most capable
doctors and nurses.

16:49.531 --> 16:51.233
So grateful.

16:51.234 --> 16:53.502
And I'd also like to say

16:53.503 --> 16:55.604
if, for some reason,
we find out

16:55.605 --> 16:59.073
that there was negligence
that caused this accident,

16:59.074 --> 17:02.143
those who are responsible

17:02.144 --> 17:05.145
are gonna have the White House
to answer to.

17:05.146 --> 17:06.747
- Yeah!
- That's right.

17:06.748 --> 17:09.215
<i>Thank you for being
here, madam vice president.</i>

17:09.217 --> 17:12.018
- You are a good woman.
- Yeah!

17:12.019 --> 17:14.119
And you're not afraid
to say what's on your mind.

17:14.121 --> 17:15.755
<i>- Oh.
- Danny Chung...</i>

17:15.756 --> 17:19.425
I... I always try to speak
as honestly as I can.

17:19.426 --> 17:21.828
<i>I heard what you
said about those people.</i>

17:21.829 --> 17:23.696
<i>You'd get my vote.</i>

17:23.698 --> 17:25.598
<i>'Cause technically
he's n an American.</i>

17:25.599 --> 17:28.068
<i>I mean...</i>

17:28.069 --> 17:30.571
They're taking over our ports.
It's like they've invaded us.

17:30.572 --> 17:33.241
<i>Yeah, and now they
think they can be president?</i>

17:33.242 --> 17:35.243
<i>- No way!
- Come on, this is the White House,</i>

17:35.244 --> 17:37.011
not the Yellow House.

17:37.012 --> 17:38.712
Come on, Selina!

17:38.713 --> 17:42.382
U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.!

17:46.086 --> 17:48.788
You have to get Chung
on the phone right away, Amy.

17:48.789 --> 17:50.922
<i>- Shut this thing down, Amy.
- Yeah, dialing now.</i>

17:50.923 --> 17:52.023
Here, he's picking up.

17:52.024 --> 17:54.259
<i>- What? I...
- Oh. Hello.</i>

17:54.260 --> 17:56.394
Hi. Yes, I have
the vice president for you.

17:57.830 --> 18:01.266
Governor?
Hi. How are you?

18:01.267 --> 18:05.237
I don't... I don't know
if you saw the footage today

18:05.238 --> 18:09.174
from "Meet the Press,"

18:09.175 --> 18:11.977
but, you know,
that is not what I meant

18:11.978 --> 18:13.779
and it certainly
isn't what I think.

18:13.780 --> 18:15.981
- Gary, the belt can wait.
- Let's just put it this way...

18:15.982 --> 18:19.519
what I was trying
to say was... Jesus Christ!

18:19.520 --> 18:21.420
Oh, my God!

18:21.421 --> 18:22.789
- Oh!
- Oh, God.

18:22.790 --> 18:25.358
Gary, that was my fucking
flesh that you just...

18:25.359 --> 18:27.527
- Hello?
- ...trapped in there.

18:27.528 --> 18:29.796
<i>- Voice mail. Keep trying.
- I'm so sorry.</i>

18:30.932 --> 18:33.400
- All right, that's enough.
- Okay.

18:33.401 --> 18:36.203
All I am saying is that if senator
Doyle pulls that meeting,

18:36.204 --> 18:40.074
there is not gonna be a lot
of availability for a while.

18:40.075 --> 18:43.043
Jennifer, quite frankly, I had
more windows in my first apartment

18:43.044 --> 18:44.979
than the V.P. currently has
in her schedule.

18:44.980 --> 18:47.281
- What's going on?
- Well, you know what?

18:47.282 --> 18:48.949
If governor Chung
doesn't call back,

18:48.950 --> 18:51.085
I can just take him down
for disrespecting the office.

18:51.086 --> 18:52.820
- How about that?
- Yes.

18:52.821 --> 18:55.222
We just lost the numbers
on filibuster reform.

18:55.223 --> 18:56.991
- What did you just say?
- Yeah, yeah.

18:56.992 --> 18:59.660
Senator Doyle has
just withdrawn his support.

18:59.661 --> 19:01.896
Something Amy said
at Chung's book launch.

19:01.897 --> 19:04.266
He was still upset
about clean jobs,

19:04.267 --> 19:07.202
which is on you, Dan, because you put
Sidney Purcell on the task force.

19:07.203 --> 19:09.872
Oh, sure! You know what?
I blame George Washington.

19:09.873 --> 19:12.074
If he hadn't started this whole form
of government, then we wouldn't...

19:12.075 --> 19:16.245
Okay, okay, stop squabbling!
What am I supposed to do now?

19:16.246 --> 19:17.746
Tell me that.

19:17.747 --> 19:21.549
I'm supposed to call Doyle
and beg him to come back?

19:21.550 --> 19:23.151
I'm the vice president
of the United States,

19:23.152 --> 19:25.553
you stupid little fuckers!

19:25.554 --> 19:27.589
These people
should be begging me!

19:27.590 --> 19:29.424
That door should be
half its height

19:29.425 --> 19:31.359
so that people can
only approach me in my office

19:31.360 --> 19:33.094
on their goddamn,
motherfucking knees.

19:33.095 --> 19:34.895
I can't lose Doyle.

19:34.896 --> 19:36.730
Who else has
a bucketful of senators?

19:36.731 --> 19:38.899
Cut Doyle loose, all right?
Call his bluff.

19:38.900 --> 19:40.300
We reach across the aisle

19:40.301 --> 19:42.335
- to the immigration reform caucus.
- What?

19:42.336 --> 19:44.637
You want to break out the white,
pointy hoods, too, ma'am?

19:44.638 --> 19:46.772
Look, we throw them a few
commitments to their cause

19:46.773 --> 19:49.141
in exchange for support
on filibuster reform.

19:49.142 --> 19:50.209
- This is easy.
- Ugh.

19:50.210 --> 19:51.610
Once you go down
that dark country road,

19:51.611 --> 19:53.612
the lights go out and the
scarecrows come to life.

19:53.613 --> 19:55.247
Yeah, anyone hear
the banjo music?

19:55.248 --> 19:57.515
Look, Mike, that's what you
always hear because mentally

19:57.516 --> 19:58.983
you're in a fuckin' hammock
on a back porch.

19:58.984 --> 20:00.618
Dan, this isn't
fantasy politics.

20:00.619 --> 20:02.186
Stop it!
Stop it!

20:02.187 --> 20:04.421
This is a win for you
on Senate reform

20:04.422 --> 20:06.056
and it's also
another big win for you

20:06.057 --> 20:07.858
with the president
on immigration, all right?

20:07.859 --> 20:08.892
Win big, win big.

20:08.893 --> 20:11.228
I don't know...
maybe you and Dan

20:11.229 --> 20:12.829
should go down and talk to...

20:12.830 --> 20:16.266
J... God damn it...
the senator from Arizona.

20:16.267 --> 20:18.802
The one who wants to random
search people in ponchos?

20:18.803 --> 20:19.970
- Oh, Bill.
- O'Brien.

20:19.971 --> 20:21.572
<i>- Yeah.
- Yeah.</i>

20:21.573 --> 20:24.074
He's got a lot of sway
with the pro-Caucasian caucus.

20:24.075 --> 20:25.809
All right, so we get O'Brien,

20:25.810 --> 20:27.377
who brings us McCaulay
and Cunliffe.

20:27.378 --> 20:29.479
Is McCaulay the one
with the nose hair problem

20:29.480 --> 20:31.282
like he's got two raccoons
in his nostrils?

20:31.283 --> 20:32.816
That's seven to Doyle's five.

20:32.817 --> 20:34.885
I mean, this is
a filibuster slam dunk.

20:34.886 --> 20:36.787
- Chung is on TV live.
- What?!

20:36.788 --> 20:38.422
- Get it on. Get it on.
- Where's the remote?

20:38.423 --> 20:40.291
It's in the bowl.
The remote's in the bowl.

20:40.292 --> 20:42.159
Sue, where's the clicker?

20:42.160 --> 20:45.462
- Where's the clicker?
- Guys, it's in the credenza.

20:45.463 --> 20:46.729
Get it.
Quick, quick, quick.

20:46.730 --> 20:48.564
- What channel? Channel?
- Any live TV.

20:48.565 --> 20:50.399
Mike... no, Mike.
Don't touch that remote.

20:50.400 --> 20:51.800
You're gonna launch
a nuke or something.

20:51.801 --> 20:53.969
- Sue?
- A few brief words about the comments

20:53.970 --> 20:55.538
that were made earlier today.

20:55.539 --> 20:58.942
Despite what is said in some
dark corners of the Internet,

20:58.943 --> 21:01.478
when I was born,
both my parents

21:01.479 --> 21:04.581
<i>were fully naturalized
American citizens.</i>

21:04.582 --> 21:06.917
What? He's Captain
fuckin' America?

21:06.918 --> 21:09.120
- What's happening here? Good job, Amy.
- It's not...

21:09.121 --> 21:12.623
That is not the information
I was given by Scott.

21:12.624 --> 21:14.425
A quiet word
with one of her staff

21:14.426 --> 21:16.861
regarding the thoroughness
of their research techniques.

21:16.862 --> 21:18.496
<i>What did Scott use
as a research tool,</i>

21:18.497 --> 21:20.097
<i>the fuckin' drudge report?</i>

21:20.098 --> 21:21.666
Second-generation
Chinese American...

21:21.667 --> 21:23.301
<i>That and bathroom walls.</i>

21:23.302 --> 21:24.935
Proud enough to risk
my life for this country.

21:24.936 --> 21:26.670
<i>I've got a purple heart
on my chest,</i>

21:26.671 --> 21:28.639
but the one that beats
inside of me

21:28.640 --> 21:30.574
is red, white, and blue.

21:30.575 --> 21:33.810
- No, he didn't. He didn't say that.
- He is seizing his moment.

21:33.811 --> 21:36.379
<i>And that's why this is the
greatest country on earth.</i>

21:36.380 --> 21:39.450
I am gonna throw up a leg.

21:39.451 --> 21:41.352
And then I'm gonna
take that leg

21:41.353 --> 21:44.088
and I'm gonna beat Scott
to death with it.

21:44.089 --> 21:45.690
- Scott!
- Ah!

21:45.691 --> 21:47.492
I'm gonna go draft
a letter of apology

21:47.493 --> 21:49.995
to the king of Minnesota,
governor Chung.

21:49.996 --> 21:51.596
<i>Here's what we're gonna do...</i>

21:51.597 --> 21:53.765
Mike, big fat apology to Chung;

21:53.766 --> 21:55.801
Amy, fuck Doyle.

21:55.802 --> 21:57.569
I want this bill.

21:57.570 --> 22:01.440
You guys talk to O'Brien
and get that border caucus.

22:01.441 --> 22:03.708
- Okay.
- Amy, put on your dancing shoes

22:03.709 --> 22:05.243
and head for
the border right now.

22:05.244 --> 22:07.645
- Go on.
- No, I'm not doing it.

22:07.646 --> 22:09.180
Get a move on.

22:11.516 --> 22:13.750
This is them.

22:13.751 --> 22:15.852
Here we go.

22:15.853 --> 22:17.387
Hi, senator O'Brien.
I'm Dan Egan.

22:17.388 --> 22:19.189
We spoke on the phone.
A pleasure to meet you, sir.

22:19.190 --> 22:21.124
Well, I have no idea
who you are,

22:21.125 --> 22:23.360
so I don't know whether
it's a pleasure or not.

22:24.729 --> 22:26.997
- Okay.
- This is Jack.

22:26.998 --> 22:28.532
- Hi, Jack.
- Hi.

22:28.533 --> 22:30.634
Amy Brookheimer, vice
president's chief of staff.

22:30.635 --> 22:32.436
Chief?

22:32.437 --> 22:33.571
Shouldn't that be chiefess?

22:34.773 --> 22:36.873
Relax, missy.
I'm just yanking your chain.

22:36.874 --> 22:39.575
Absolutely.

22:39.576 --> 22:41.407
This place looks nice, huh?

22:41.408 --> 22:43.779
Looks like they do a mighty
fine plate of ribs,

22:43.780 --> 22:45.915
but before we do any ordering,

22:45.916 --> 22:48.685
I'd like to know
if you're going to offend us

22:48.686 --> 22:50.386
with some chickenshit deal

22:50.387 --> 22:52.755
that means we have to leave
before the food comes.

22:52.756 --> 22:55.225
You're fine to order.

22:56.193 --> 22:57.994
I feel so horrible.

22:57.995 --> 23:00.998
You know, it's like I've
ordered a hit on somebody.

23:00.999 --> 23:04.300
I'm just waiting for the call
to say that it's done.

23:04.301 --> 23:06.836
It's done.

23:06.837 --> 23:08.638
Do you want a glass of wine?

23:08.639 --> 23:10.874
You want some water?
You want some hand sanitiz...

23:10.875 --> 23:12.643
- I want quiet.
- Quiet?

23:12.644 --> 23:15.112
So long, Scott.
You are professionally dead.

23:15.113 --> 23:17.015
Have a nice evening.

23:17.016 --> 23:19.550
Up here on
the eastern seaboard,

23:19.551 --> 23:24.122
it's easy to forget what a big slice
of our country rubs shoulders

23:24.123 --> 23:28.894
with a failed state
by the name of Mexico.

23:28.895 --> 23:33.465
Now, if you had bad neighbors who
came into your yard every night

23:33.466 --> 23:39.104
to crap a buttful of drugs
and beans on your flowers,

23:39.105 --> 23:40.539
you might think about
building a fence.

23:40.540 --> 23:43.642
You're not gonna get a
border fence, all right?

23:43.643 --> 23:45.577
You're talking about
a 3,000-mile-long fence.

23:45.578 --> 23:47.145
Great for
the construction industry.

23:47.146 --> 23:49.614
Yeah, but ironically,
the only affordable option

23:49.615 --> 23:51.116
would be immigrant labor.

23:51.117 --> 23:54.119
Well, my constituents
are fed up

23:54.120 --> 23:57.022
with feeling outnumbered
in their own country.

23:57.023 --> 23:59.591
Fellas, we shouldn't
have a problem

23:59.592 --> 24:03.362
working to preserve a certain
kind of American identity.

24:03.363 --> 24:05.531
Yes.

24:05.532 --> 24:07.533
<i>Now you keep talking
like that, sweetheart,</i>

24:07.534 --> 24:09.702
and we'll be having cigars
at the end of this dinner.

24:09.703 --> 24:11.104
Just not Cuban ones.

24:13.574 --> 24:15.275
Hey.

24:15.276 --> 24:16.709
Oh, my God,

24:16.710 --> 24:20.046
<i>- I am having the shittiest day.
- Yeah?</i>

24:20.047 --> 24:21.881
You got anything
to make me feel better?

24:21.882 --> 24:23.249
I do indeed.

24:23.250 --> 24:25.218
<i>- What is it?
- Well...</i>

24:25.219 --> 24:28.553
It's about seven inches,
hangs between my legs...

24:30.223 --> 24:31.590
The thing.

24:31.591 --> 24:33.758
I like to call him
sergeant Ted.

24:33.759 --> 24:36.961
<i>Okay, well,
you tell sergeant Ted</i>

24:36.962 --> 24:39.898
I would like him very much

24:39.899 --> 24:43.702
to drill me in my oval office.

24:43.703 --> 24:46.639
<i>In fact, I need him
to put the finger</i>

24:46.640 --> 24:48.174
on the button

24:48.175 --> 24:51.245
and come into my rose garden.

24:51.246 --> 24:53.914
The sergeant is standing
at attention.

24:53.915 --> 24:57.517
You know what... I'm coming
over there, like, right away.

24:57.518 --> 25:00.053
<i>Uh, you know,
when you come over,</i>

25:00.054 --> 25:01.721
can you try
and sneak in incognito?

25:01.722 --> 25:03.490
I got Korean neighbors
and I don't think

25:03.491 --> 25:05.192
<i>they'd like the idea
of me dating you.</i>

25:05.193 --> 25:07.194
Is that some kind of a joke
or something?

25:07.195 --> 25:09.262
<i>It's not funny at all.
Fuck off, Ted.</i>

25:09.263 --> 25:11.898
I mean, I don't
know why you would s...

25:15.202 --> 25:17.770
<i>- You were... you were on the phone?
- Mm-hmm.</i>

25:17.771 --> 25:20.406
- Oh, I didn't hear anything.
- You better not have heard anything.

25:20.407 --> 25:21.907
I didn't say anything.

25:21.908 --> 25:23.910
Oh, my God.

25:24.979 --> 25:27.181
Oh, for fuck sakes.
Hey, Jonah.

25:27.182 --> 25:28.783
What happened
to your hot pants?

25:28.784 --> 25:31.118
Oh, the hot pants picked up
some negative traction.

25:31.119 --> 25:33.288
I realize now they're unbecoming
of my office.

25:33.289 --> 25:35.824
I'm just coming in to see
if the misunderstanding

25:35.825 --> 25:37.525
with governor Chung
has been resolved.

25:37.526 --> 25:41.119
Yeah.
It's all fine and dandy and fabulous.

25:41.120 --> 25:43.932
Excellent. Well, then, I'm gonna go enjoy
what's left of my Sunday.

25:43.933 --> 25:46.134
I got the latest Grisham on
the go and it's just awesome.

25:46.135 --> 25:47.702
You should read...

25:47.703 --> 25:49.437
As well as the funding request,

25:49.438 --> 25:52.107
we can offer a commitment that the
vice president will oppose immunity

25:52.108 --> 25:56.311
for any illegal immigrants who have
been here for more than five years.

25:56.312 --> 26:00.148
Well, now you're singing
a tune that we may dance to.

26:00.149 --> 26:02.584
- Well, we just...
- And she will lobby the president

26:02.585 --> 26:05.053
and express public support
for your position.

26:06.389 --> 26:09.291
All right, I'm going home.

26:09.292 --> 26:10.659
I'm getting fucked
every which way.

26:10.660 --> 26:13.995
<i>- Sue, did the president call?
- No.</i>

26:13.996 --> 26:18.367
If you can deliver that, I will
appear to love filibuster reform

26:18.368 --> 26:21.337
as much as I appear
to love my idiot son.

26:21.338 --> 26:22.972
And for my wife's sake,

26:22.973 --> 26:26.142
I appear to love
that wretched shitnia lot.

26:27.811 --> 26:29.812
Good night.
Let's go, Jack.

26:29.813 --> 26:33.082
Good to see you guys could learn
a new word today... compromise.

26:33.083 --> 26:35.351
What do you say?
Meet me halfway?

26:42.959 --> 26:44.359
Whew.

26:44.360 --> 26:46.160
I'm not gonna be able
to sleep tonight.

26:46.161 --> 26:47.529
That was fuckin' dark.

26:47.530 --> 26:49.630
You've gone up 10 levels
in my estimation, by the way.

26:49.631 --> 26:51.199
Which means I've gone
down 100 in my own.

26:51.200 --> 26:54.401
Sometimes you've gotta
go down to go up.

26:54.402 --> 26:57.171
Eh... I am taking
the credit for this.

26:57.172 --> 26:59.173
I tunneled through the shit,
I get the dirty glory.

26:59.174 --> 27:00.975
It is me who tells
Selina the good news.

27:05.213 --> 27:06.681
Where is the vice president?

27:06.682 --> 27:08.850
She has gone home
for the evening.

27:08.851 --> 27:10.307
Why?

27:10.308 --> 27:12.921
Something about "getting fucked
every which way."

27:12.922 --> 27:14.255
Direct quote.

27:14.256 --> 27:16.190
Oh, God, yeah.
I heard something on the phone.

27:16.191 --> 27:18.125
Oh, God.
Oh, God.

27:18.126 --> 27:20.595
How many times can
she be underneath that?

27:20.596 --> 27:24.098
She's got such a little body
and he seemed like a big man.

27:24.099 --> 27:25.362
Who? Who's he?

27:25.363 --> 27:27.802
Hey, hey, somebody talk about
something else?

27:27.803 --> 27:28.687
Anything.

27:28.688 --> 27:29.670
Yeah, I gotta get these images
out of my head.

27:29.671 --> 27:31.105
Can we talk about...
I don't know...

27:31.106 --> 27:32.706
our favorite band
or something, please?

27:32.707 --> 27:35.009
Yes. Who else are you into,
Mike, apart from the Eagles?

27:35.010 --> 27:36.610
Uh, grateful dead.

27:36.611 --> 27:38.646
Oh, that's the name of your
favorite whorehouse, too, right?

27:38.647 --> 27:41.583
Ugh, can't wait to get home
and burn my clothes.

27:41.584 --> 27:43.318
Don't fuck up that suit, Mike.

27:43.319 --> 27:46.588
- All right, good night, Sue.
- Good night, Gary.

27:46.589 --> 27:48.290
Good night, Dan.

27:48.291 --> 27:50.226
Jesus Christ.

27:52.430 --> 27:54.031
<i>Dan, you have
about 10 seconds</i>

27:54.032 --> 27:55.499
<i>to stop distracting me,</i>

27:55.500 --> 27:56.834
or the next thing
that they'll find

27:56.835 --> 27:58.936
at the back of that couch
are your remains.

27:58.937 --> 28:01.639
If you like, I can go sit
in the vice president's office.

28:01.640 --> 28:03.341
<i>Excuse me?</i>
