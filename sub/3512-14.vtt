00:04.000 --> 00:05.470
[ sighs ]
did you see that tunic

00:05.470 --> 00:08.170
Professor jablonski
was wearing yesterday

00:08.170 --> 00:10.540
In advanced draping?
I know.

00:10.540 --> 00:12.640
It was very "sad cat lady
meets david bowie."

00:12.640 --> 00:15.980
This is what it's come to --
dumpster-diving to find fabric

00:15.980 --> 00:18.080
For our midterm
haute couture project.

00:18.080 --> 00:19.650
Well, you know
what they say.

00:19.650 --> 00:21.580
One man's trash
is another man's --
[ gasps ]

00:21.580 --> 00:24.620
I think I found something.
Oh! Me too!

00:24.620 --> 00:26.490
Ooh!
It's stuck.

00:26.490 --> 00:28.190
That's because
we're both tugging on it.

00:28.190 --> 00:30.660
Let go.
I had it first.

00:32.159 --> 00:35.660
Oh, this fabric
is just to die for.

00:35.660 --> 00:37.000
The lace, the décolletage --

00:37.000 --> 00:39.230
This would look stunning
on you -- just stunning.

00:39.230 --> 00:45.000
Mother, what are you trying
to force on my lovely fiancée?
No, no, no, no, no.

00:45.010 --> 00:46.970
I am just trying
to expose katherine

00:46.980 --> 00:50.210
To the glorious world
of wedding magazines.

00:50.210 --> 00:53.680
They are all very girly,
with a lot of gauzy photos

00:53.680 --> 00:56.250
Of love-struck brides
looking off into the distance.

00:56.250 --> 00:59.020
Perhaps they're contemplating
the 50% divorce rate.

00:59.020 --> 01:02.520
You need to get beyond
the fairytale-treacle aspect

01:02.520 --> 01:05.060
Of these magazines and see them
for what they are --

01:05.060 --> 01:08.090
A source of ideas
as you plan your wedding.

01:08.100 --> 01:09.160
Yeah.

01:09.160 --> 01:11.830
Like this place.

01:11.830 --> 01:13.100
The cordova house?

01:13.100 --> 01:16.200
Uh, "a landmark
spanish revival mansion

01:16.200 --> 01:19.610
With an elegant
carriage-house exterior."

01:19.610 --> 01:21.010
"it was built
at the turn of the century,

01:21.010 --> 01:22.640
"remains an enduring legacy
of architectural beauty

01:22.640 --> 01:24.210
In the heart of manhattan."

01:24.210 --> 01:27.910
Aha.
I remember the cordova house.

01:27.920 --> 01:31.050
It was like a cultural venue
for the arts in the '70s.

01:31.050 --> 01:36.020
Of course, it was the '70s,
so I can't be sure.

01:36.020 --> 01:38.260
And they've started
to book weddings.

01:38.260 --> 01:40.060
I love it.
It's gorgeous.

01:41.630 --> 01:43.700
Could it be that we've
stumbled upon a venue

01:43.700 --> 01:47.300
Yeah! I mean, I'm good with it.
Are you?

01:48.270 --> 01:50.840
[ giggles ]
[ chuckles ]

01:50.840 --> 01:52.040
[ sighs ]

01:52.040 --> 01:53.170
You're welcome.

01:53.170 --> 01:54.840
Ah! Thank you.
Yeah, thank you.
Sorry.

01:54.840 --> 01:57.910
I'm gonna make, um...
Some inquiries right now.

01:57.910 --> 02:00.780
Uh, you're gonna have to do it
while we're working a case.

02:02.680 --> 02:04.980
Okay. Thank you.
I appreciate it. All right.

02:04.990 --> 02:06.790
Apparently, we aren't the only
ones who read that article.

02:06.790 --> 02:08.350
The event planner
at the cordova house

02:08.360 --> 02:09.919
Said they've been
swamped with calls.

02:09.919 --> 02:11.320
Okay. When's their next
available date?

02:11.330 --> 02:12.960
She said
she's gonna call me back.

02:12.960 --> 02:14.690
Hey, espo,
what have we got?

02:14.700 --> 02:16.360
A body found
by two fashion students

02:16.360 --> 02:17.830
Dumpster-diving
for fabric.

02:17.830 --> 02:19.730
Victim's name is ella hayes.
She's 26.

02:19.730 --> 02:21.700
According to her
driver's license,

02:21.700 --> 02:24.670
What's she doing down here
in the garment district?

02:24.670 --> 02:29.310
Her business card says that
she works for <i>modern fashion.</i>

02:29.310 --> 02:30.980
She's an assistant
to the editor-in-chief.

02:30.980 --> 02:32.650
Yeah, that would be
matilda king.

02:33.980 --> 02:35.950
Okay.
Seriously?

02:35.950 --> 02:37.750
You've never heard
of matilda king?

02:37.750 --> 02:39.690
I'm betting
that most <i>real</i> men haven't.

02:39.690 --> 02:42.290
Mm, yes, if by "real"
you mean "uninformed."
whatever.

02:42.290 --> 02:44.360
Matilda king is a legend
in the fashion industry.

02:44.360 --> 02:47.290
Or infamous --
depends on your point of view.

02:47.300 --> 02:50.330
Yes. Former assistants
of hers have written books
about how tough she is.

02:50.330 --> 02:53.200
A dragon lady -- chews people up
and spits them out.

02:53.200 --> 02:54.330
Does she also
strangle 'em?

02:54.340 --> 02:56.170
'cause that's how lanie said
our vic died.

02:56.170 --> 02:57.940
Hey, lanie.
Hey.

02:57.940 --> 03:01.370
So, the murder weapon was
a scarf, a sash, or something.

03:01.380 --> 03:06.050
Okay.
When did this happen?
Based on lividity,
between 12:00 and 2:00 a.M.

03:06.050 --> 03:08.250
I also recovered some blue hairs
on her neck

03:08.250 --> 03:09.980
Left by the attacker.

03:09.980 --> 03:11.380
Castle:
Blue hairs?

03:11.390 --> 03:12.950
So she was killed
by a little old lady?

03:12.950 --> 03:15.090
Or...Katy perry.

03:16.660 --> 03:19.690
Animal hairs
that were died blue, castle.

03:19.690 --> 03:21.930
Or...
A dr. Seuss character.

03:21.930 --> 03:24.300
I don't recall any of them
being homicidal.

03:24.300 --> 03:26.900
That's true.
I need a new theory.

03:26.900 --> 03:27.800
Well, I've got one.

03:27.800 --> 03:31.440
And he or she was able to lift
the body into the dumpster.

03:31.440 --> 03:32.810
Espo, can you get uniforms

03:32.810 --> 03:34.370
To canvass the area
for any witnesses?

03:34.380 --> 03:35.840
Castle and I
will go to her work.

03:35.840 --> 03:37.240
You and ryan head off
to her place --

03:37.250 --> 03:40.880
That'll indicate
why she was here last night.
Esposito: Right on.

03:43.950 --> 03:45.850
Ella and I
went to parsons together.

03:45.850 --> 03:49.160
And then we've been roommates
for the past two years.

03:49.160 --> 03:50.990
I still
can't believe this.

03:50.990 --> 03:54.330
[ sighs ]
when was the last time
you saw her?

03:54.330 --> 03:58.730
She was up at 5:00, like always,
and then out the door

03:58.730 --> 04:00.970
To get matilda's coffee
and cranberry scone

04:00.970 --> 04:03.770
What about after work --
did you see her then?

04:03.770 --> 04:07.140
I'm a buyer at saks,
so I don't get home till late.

04:07.140 --> 04:10.280
Did ella have a boyfriend
or a relationship?

04:10.280 --> 04:11.340
[ scoffs ]
no.

04:11.350 --> 04:12.950
She was on call
for matilda 24/7,

04:12.950 --> 04:15.310
So she didn't have time
for relationships...

04:15.320 --> 04:18.050
Or for the one thing
that she really wanted to do.

04:18.050 --> 04:20.850
Which was what?
Design.

04:24.420 --> 04:26.060
She hoped
working at <i>modern fashion</i>

04:26.060 --> 04:30.800
Was ella having any problems
that you know of?

04:30.800 --> 04:32.200
Um...
She had been stressed lately,

04:32.200 --> 04:33.130
A little more than usual.

04:33.130 --> 04:37.170
She said it was work,
but she didn't go into details.

04:37.170 --> 04:38.940
Lilian,
if you don't mind,

04:38.940 --> 04:40.970
I'd like to have an officer
come by and take your statement.

Of course.
Anything I can do to help.

04:44.450 --> 04:46.350
Oh, we don't get
cell reception in here.

04:46.350 --> 04:49.850
You can use my landline
if you like.
Thanks.

04:49.850 --> 04:51.420
Here's my card.

04:51.420 --> 04:53.020

anything else,

okay?

05:05.170 --> 05:09.000
The big leagues for anyone
who wants to work in fashion.

05:09.000 --> 05:10.440
Wow. Apparently,
you have to be a total hottie

05:10.440 --> 05:13.810
And I'm saying that
as a completely detached,

05:13.810 --> 05:15.170

05:15.180 --> 05:17.280
It's okay, castle.
Stare all you want.
Really?

05:18.280 --> 05:20.780
Actually, no.
But it's kind of hard not to.

05:20.780 --> 05:22.310
I mean,
matilda only hires people

05:22.320 --> 05:25.350
That fit the magazine's brand.
You have to...Look the part.

05:25.350 --> 05:28.220
You seem to know a lot
about matilda king.
[ sighs ] yeah, well,
I've picked up a thing or two.

Hi. Nypd. We need to speak
with matilda king.

the part about the nypd.

05:35.030 --> 05:36.200
Please.

05:36.200 --> 05:40.930
She's going to freak out
if I add you to the schedule.

05:40.940 --> 05:42.800
Do you have any idea what
happened to the last assistant?

05:42.800 --> 05:44.440
Yes. She's dead.

05:44.440 --> 05:46.870
Dead?
What do you mean?

05:46.870 --> 05:49.280
Matilda: No, no, no, no.
Oh, god. Here she comes.

05:49.280 --> 05:50.880
I won't take no
for an answer.

05:50.880 --> 05:53.280
You must join us
on the yacht.

05:53.280 --> 05:55.880
Giorgio will show
his new collection.

of style --

06:02.260 --> 06:04.290
No doubt, in the wrong
direction. [ chuckles ]

06:04.290 --> 06:06.860
So, let me know.

06:06.860 --> 06:09.160
New assistant.
It's carrie.

06:09.160 --> 06:11.330
I'll learn your name
when you've earned it. Here.

Oh, uh,
these are your messages,

06:13.370 --> 06:16.040

You modeled
for <i>modern fashion?</i>

was on the cover.

06:43.100 --> 06:44.630

to ever tell me no.

Uh, get ready
to be told no again.

About your assistant,

06:55.940 --> 06:56.640
It cannot wait.

06:57.640 --> 06:58.910
We'll talk in my office.

06:58.910 --> 07:03.420
By the way,
ella is my <i>former</i> assistant.

07:09.420 --> 07:11.420
Be right with you,
julian.

07:11.430 --> 07:13.560
Okay.

07:13.560 --> 07:15.960
Uh, so,
what do you mean by "former"?

07:15.960 --> 07:17.260
I fired her
yesterday afternoon,

07:17.270 --> 07:19.500
After she made
a scheduling mistake

07:19.500 --> 07:22.300
And I showed up
to a board meeting late.

07:22.300 --> 07:25.240
And that was after her mistake
last week,

07:25.240 --> 07:29.040
When I kept the new owner of our
magazine waiting for 45 minutes.

07:29.040 --> 07:32.410
Matilda, have you seen
the proofs from the
"fab five" photo shoot?

07:32.410 --> 07:33.550
They are divine.

07:33.550 --> 07:35.380
They'd better be, julian.

07:35.380 --> 07:37.280
So far,
everything you've submitted

07:37.290 --> 07:41.220
Oh, matilda, these designers
are barely out of diapers.

07:41.220 --> 07:42.490
E-excuse me. Sorry.

07:42.490 --> 07:46.330
We're investigating
a murder here.

07:46.330 --> 07:48.190
Murder?

07:48.200 --> 07:49.300
Of whom?

07:49.300 --> 07:51.400
Your former assistant,
ella.

07:51.400 --> 07:54.270
El-- ella's dead?
How?

07:54.270 --> 07:55.570
That's what we're trying
to figure out.

07:55.570 --> 07:57.470
Now, do you know
if she had any problems?

07:59.610 --> 08:01.340
You don't think
this had anything to do

08:01.340 --> 08:02.680
With that incident
with grace?

08:02.680 --> 08:03.980
What incident?

08:03.980 --> 08:05.240
And who's grace?

08:05.250 --> 08:09.010
Grace is my other assistant,
whom I fired

08:09.020 --> 08:11.950
Because she allowed the
scheduling mistakes to happen.

08:11.950 --> 08:13.290
And what was
the incident?

08:13.290 --> 08:15.390
Well, apparently, yesterday,
when ella and grace

08:15.390 --> 08:17.420
Were escorted out of
the building by security,

08:17.430 --> 08:18.590
They literally
got into a brawl,

08:18.590 --> 08:20.330
Right in the middle
of a photo shoot.

08:20.330 --> 08:22.290
The photographer, serge,
had to break it up.

08:22.300 --> 08:24.630
Serge: Yeah. The two of them
really went at it.

08:24.630 --> 08:26.670
I mean,
it was a full-on catfight.

08:26.670 --> 08:28.330
It was actually
kind of sexy.

08:28.340 --> 08:30.140
What exactly
was the fight about?

08:30.140 --> 08:34.409
I overheard grace blame ella
for -- for getting her fired.

08:34.409 --> 08:35.440
Yumi: Serge!

08:35.440 --> 08:38.510
I'm up against a deadline
to finish my design.

08:38.510 --> 08:40.750
You'll be here as long as it
takes to make matilda happy.

08:40.750 --> 08:42.350

08:43.350 --> 08:45.450
The mantra
we all live by.

08:45.450 --> 08:47.750
Uh, did you remember any other
details about the fight?

08:47.760 --> 08:49.990
I can do better than that.
I can <i>show</i> you something.

08:49.990 --> 08:53.990
And got a few frames
with them in the background.

08:56.300 --> 08:57.460
There. Check it out.

08:57.470 --> 08:59.670
Can...You zoom in on that?

08:59.670 --> 09:00.630
Sure.

09:01.330 --> 09:03.400
Check out grace's scarf.

09:03.400 --> 09:06.340
Lanie said she found blue hairs
on ella's neck

09:06.340 --> 09:07.540
From being strangled.

09:07.540 --> 09:09.440
Looks like grace
was dressed to kill.

09:20.650 --> 09:24.290
Look, I grew up
reading <i>modern fashion.</i>

09:24.290 --> 09:26.290
Working for matilda king,
that was my dream.

09:26.290 --> 09:28.760
But when matilda fires someone,
people remember,

09:28.760 --> 09:31.200
Which means my career in fashion
is pretty much done,

09:31.200 --> 09:34.530
Because you believed it was
her fault that you got fired.

09:34.540 --> 09:38.640
She started making mistakes
because she was so busy

09:38.640 --> 09:40.510
Sucking up to designers
like yumi

09:40.510 --> 09:43.140
And showing off her sketches,
and I paid the price.

09:43.140 --> 09:44.680
Which is why
you killed her.

09:44.680 --> 09:46.210
What are you even
talking about?

09:46.210 --> 09:47.680
We got in a fight.
That was it.

09:47.680 --> 09:50.280
Okay, okay.
Then explain this.

09:50.280 --> 09:53.820
This blue alpaca scarf
was found at your apartment.

09:53.820 --> 09:55.490
It's an exact match
to the hairs

09:55.490 --> 09:57.790
Found on ella's neck
after she was strangled.

09:57.790 --> 09:59.560
[ sighs ] come on.
Other people have that scarf.

09:59.560 --> 10:01.630
Yeah, but you're the only one
with motive.

10:01.630 --> 10:03.760
It was the christmas gift
from <i>modern fashion.</i>

10:03.760 --> 10:08.570
Maybe ella was wearing hers
and someone choked her with it.

10:10.270 --> 10:13.070
Where were you between
12:00 and 2:00 a.M., grace?

10:13.070 --> 10:14.340
I'd just gotten fired.

10:14.340 --> 10:16.340
Some friends took me out
and got me drunk.

10:16.340 --> 10:17.680
You can ask them.
I will.

10:17.680 --> 10:19.650
In the meantime,
let's talk about ella.

10:19.650 --> 10:21.750
Her roommate thought
that she was having trouble

10:21.750 --> 10:24.620
You worked with her.
You know what it was?

10:24.620 --> 10:28.320
Actually,
there was something else.

10:28.320 --> 10:30.520
A few days ago,
at lunchtime,

10:30.520 --> 10:32.830
I saw her arguing with this guy
outside the building.

10:32.830 --> 10:34.660
Did you recognize him?

10:34.660 --> 10:36.160
I'd never seen him before.

10:36.160 --> 10:38.430
But I overheard them,
and he was threatening her.

10:38.430 --> 10:41.470
He said she had something
he wanted and he wouldn't
take no for an answer.

10:41.470 --> 10:44.170
And what was her reaction?
She said she was gonna
call the police

10:44.170 --> 10:47.540
If he didn't leave her
the hell alone, and
then he stormed off.

10:47.540 --> 10:49.270
I-I tried to ask her
what it was all about,

10:49.280 --> 10:52.680
Do you remember him well enough
to help us with a sketch?

10:52.680 --> 10:54.250
I think so.

10:54.250 --> 10:56.680
Okay, this is the guy
who threatened ella.

10:56.680 --> 10:58.550
So, you believe
grace's story?

10:58.550 --> 11:03.720
And unis found two witnesses
that saw him arguing with ella.

11:03.720 --> 11:05.790
Ella was basically
a glorified assistant.

11:05.790 --> 11:08.560
What could she possibly have had
that this man wanted?

11:08.560 --> 11:10.230
Well, think about it,
castle.

11:10.230 --> 11:12.530
Matilda king is the most
influential person in fashion,

11:12.530 --> 11:14.570
And ella had direct access
to her world.

11:14.570 --> 11:17.340
So you're saying this man
leveraged ella

11:17.340 --> 11:21.570
To find out what direction
hemlines are going next season?

11:21.580 --> 11:23.610
Ooh! I just came up
with a new title.

11:23.610 --> 11:25.510
"murder is the new black."

11:25.510 --> 11:26.680
Does that even make sense?

11:26.680 --> 11:31.850
Did you guys find something
at ella's apartment?
You could say that.

11:31.850 --> 11:34.590
I went to use the landline,
and I noticed some static
when I got near a lamp.

11:34.590 --> 11:36.660
When we popped that lamp open,
look what we found inside.

11:36.660 --> 11:37.690
A bug?

11:39.230 --> 11:40.690
Why would someone bug
ella's apartment?

11:40.690 --> 11:43.560
Because...She is
"la femme nikita,"

11:43.560 --> 11:46.500
And her job at <i>modern fashion</i>
<i>is just a cover.</i>

11:46.500 --> 11:48.200
She's not
"la femme nikita."

11:48.200 --> 11:51.670
Still, wiretaps, threats
from mysterious men, murder --

11:51.670 --> 11:53.570
Whatever's going on here,
it's bigger than fashion.

11:53.570 --> 11:54.740
Okay, see if you can get
a serial number.

11:54.740 --> 11:56.440
Let's figure out
who bought that bug.

11:56.440 --> 11:57.780
Yeah.

11:59.910 --> 12:01.680
All right.
Thank you very much.

12:01.680 --> 12:02.950
Hey.

12:02.950 --> 12:05.380
That was the event planner
at the cordova house.

12:05.390 --> 12:07.720
They said they still have
a few spots open in the fall.

12:07.720 --> 12:09.420
She can give us
a tour tonight.

12:09.420 --> 12:11.290
Whoo-hoo!
Let's do it.

12:11.290 --> 12:13.660
So, where are we
on watergate?
So, the plot thickens.

12:13.660 --> 12:15.560
The building manager
at ella's apartment

12:15.560 --> 12:17.400
Remembers letting
an exterminator into her place

12:17.400 --> 12:20.800
Usually, exterminators
get <i>rid</i> of bugs.

12:20.800 --> 12:22.530
Only this one didn't.

12:22.540 --> 12:24.540
The company that he worked for
doesn't exist.

12:24.540 --> 12:26.570
I mean, what is this about,
castle?

12:26.570 --> 12:28.240
Why would someone
target ella?

12:28.240 --> 12:30.710
Well, you already heard
and rejected my theory.

12:30.710 --> 12:32.950
Yeah, but your theory doesn't
explain the little detail

12:32.950 --> 12:34.810
That lanie just found out.

12:34.820 --> 12:36.880
There's black coral
on the sole of ella's shoe,

12:36.880 --> 12:38.480
And it wasn't
from the dumpster.

12:38.490 --> 12:39.720
Well, that doesn't make
any sense.

12:39.720 --> 12:41.450
Black coral is found
in the tropics.

12:41.460 --> 12:43.320
Exactly. So how did this
end up on her shoe?

12:43.320 --> 12:45.260
Yo, beckett.
And castle.

12:45.260 --> 12:46.430
Sure.

12:46.430 --> 12:50.660
But we got a hit off the canvass
of the crime scene.

12:50.660 --> 12:51.760
A seamstress
coming off the late shift

12:51.770 --> 12:54.470
Right near the alley
where ella was killed.

12:54.470 --> 12:55.630
We get a description?

12:55.640 --> 12:57.700
Yeah, and he matches
our sketch.

12:58.670 --> 13:00.610
Yes. That's him.

13:00.610 --> 13:03.840
Outside the broadway
coffee shop when I walked by.

13:03.840 --> 13:04.910
And what time
was this?

13:04.910 --> 13:08.650
Do you recall how tall he was,
what he wore?

13:08.650 --> 13:10.950
Fabric is my business.

13:10.950 --> 13:13.790
He wore a dark suit --
nice quality, wool blend.

13:13.790 --> 13:16.360
Oh, and he had
a distinctive striped tie --

13:16.360 --> 13:19.990
Crimson and navy with gold
triangles across the stripes.

13:19.990 --> 13:21.830
That sounds like
a club tie.

13:21.830 --> 13:23.530
Crimson and navy --
yes, I know that one.

13:23.530 --> 13:25.960
Gold triangles.
That's the carlton club tie.

13:25.970 --> 13:28.870
If we can match that
sketch to one of its
members, we got our I.D.

13:28.870 --> 13:32.840
Are notoriously protective of
keeping their members' privacy.

13:32.840 --> 13:35.010
They're not just gonna
hand over that information.

13:35.010 --> 13:38.810
The club won't, no,
but one of its members might.

13:39.980 --> 13:43.620
After a tough negotiation
that involved my knicks tickets

13:43.620 --> 13:45.780
And naming a character
in my next book after his nana,

13:45.790 --> 13:48.390
My friend came up
with a name -- marcus conway.

13:48.390 --> 13:52.360
Okay, so, what do we know
about him?
He is a lawyer
at kellerman goodfriend.

13:52.360 --> 13:55.630
That's one of the city's
biggest law firms.

13:55.630 --> 13:57.760
Why is a high-powered lawyer
going after ella?

13:57.770 --> 13:59.670
Maybe it has to do
with her work.

13:59.670 --> 14:03.040
Is general counsel
for <i>couture chick</i> magazine.

14:03.040 --> 14:04.670
That's "chic,"
and not that you would know,

14:04.670 --> 14:07.740
But they are <i>modern fashion's</i>
<i>biggest competitor.</i>

14:07.740 --> 14:09.780
Call conway's firm.
I want to know where he is.

14:11.480 --> 14:13.650
Detective,
I would think very carefully

14:13.650 --> 14:15.880
Before making these kinds
of accusations.

14:15.880 --> 14:18.520
Mr. Conway, I am not making
any accusations.

14:18.520 --> 14:19.850
I am simply stating fact.

14:19.850 --> 14:22.650
We have a witness that heard you
threatening ella hayes

14:22.660 --> 14:24.620
And another one that saw you
near where she was killed.

14:24.630 --> 14:26.860
Right about the same time
she ended up that way.

14:26.860 --> 14:28.660
You need
to explain yourself.

14:28.660 --> 14:30.530
Gloria: Marcus,
I heard the police are here.

14:30.530 --> 14:31.760
What's going on?

14:31.770 --> 14:32.600
Who are you?

14:32.600 --> 14:35.800
I'm editor-in-chief
of <i>couture chic.</i>

14:35.800 --> 14:39.470
They think I murdered
ella hayes.
What?
That's ridiculous.

14:39.470 --> 14:43.610
This is obviously
one huge misunderstanding.
Then clear it up.

14:43.610 --> 14:45.080
Tell me what you know
about ella hayes.

14:47.450 --> 14:50.750
We approached ella
and attempted to...

14:50.750 --> 14:52.450
Engage her services.

14:52.450 --> 14:54.120
So, basically,
you tried to hire her

14:54.120 --> 14:56.590
To get inside information
on <i>modern fashion.</i>

14:56.590 --> 14:58.590
I wouldn't put it that way.
Well, I'm pretty sure
she would,

14:58.590 --> 14:59.990
Which is why
she turned you down.

14:59.990 --> 15:01.690
And you wouldn't take no
for an answer.

15:01.700 --> 15:02.990
Look, this is
a competitive business

15:03.000 --> 15:04.800
With everyone looking
to get an edge.

15:04.800 --> 15:06.570
Yes, I was aggressive
in trying to make a deal,

15:06.570 --> 15:09.970
I accepted that,
and I never contacted her again.

15:09.970 --> 15:11.740
Then why were you
less than a block away

15:11.740 --> 15:14.540
From where she was killed
at about the time she died?

15:14.540 --> 15:16.110
Because <i>she</i> called <i>me.</i>

15:16.110 --> 15:18.380
She asked me to meet her
last night.

15:18.380 --> 15:19.850
Why would she do that?

15:19.850 --> 15:21.810
Probably because
matilda just fired her.

15:21.820 --> 15:23.650
The bottom line is,
she said she had

15:23.650 --> 15:25.480
Bombshell information
on <i>modern fashion --</i>

15:25.490 --> 15:27.990
Information that, if it got out,
it would destroy the magazine.

15:31.920 --> 15:36.800
Mr. Conway, I took a look
at ella's cellphone records.

15:36.800 --> 15:38.530
She never called you
last night.

15:38.530 --> 15:40.930
She did call,
and I can prove it.

15:40.930 --> 15:42.100
She left me a message.

15:42.100 --> 15:43.100
[ cellphone beeps ]

15:43.100 --> 15:45.770
<i>I changed my mind</i>
<i>about your offer.</i>

15:45.770 --> 15:48.840
<i>Something that'll</i>
<i>ruin</i> modern fashion,

<i>Take down the whole operation.</i>

15:50.680 --> 15:52.880
<i>Meet me at the broadway</i>
<i>coffee shop in an hour.</i>

15:52.880 --> 15:56.150
I waited around for two hours,
but she never showed.

15:56.150 --> 15:58.420
What information
did she want to share?

15:58.420 --> 16:02.490
What were you trying
to hire her to find out?

16:02.490 --> 16:04.620
As you may have heard,

16:04.630 --> 16:07.490
A tech-venture capitalist
named glen carter

16:07.490 --> 16:09.590
Bought <i>modern fashion</i>
<i>last month.</i>

16:09.600 --> 16:11.060
Glen has big plans

16:11.060 --> 16:13.100
To drag matilda's
precious little magazine

16:13.100 --> 16:17.570
Which are?
Well, that's what
we wanted to know,

16:17.570 --> 16:18.870
Since our website
has failed to generate

16:18.870 --> 16:20.170
New subscription business.

16:20.170 --> 16:22.640
If we could get
modern fashion's new playbook,

16:22.640 --> 16:26.550
It could help us strategize
and stay one step ahead.

16:26.550 --> 16:28.450
So, you wanted to hire ella

16:28.450 --> 16:30.550
So that she could tell you
about the new direction

16:30.550 --> 16:33.220
The magazine was taking,
and when she turned you down,

16:33.220 --> 16:34.920
That was the extent
of your contact?

16:34.920 --> 16:36.190
Until she called
last night.

16:36.190 --> 16:37.920
And what about
the eavesdropping?

16:40.030 --> 16:42.230
W-what are you
talking about?

16:42.230 --> 16:44.460
We found a listening device
in ella's apartment.

16:44.470 --> 16:47.230
That wasn't us.
We had nothing to do with that.

16:47.230 --> 16:50.500
So, these records explain
why we missed ella's phone calls

16:50.500 --> 16:51.800
To marcus conway.

16:51.810 --> 16:53.970
She phoned him
using her roommate's landline.

16:53.970 --> 16:57.240
So, she told conway to meet her
in the coffee shop in an hour.

16:57.240 --> 16:59.540
It would take her about
20 minutes to get there
from her apartment,

16:59.550 --> 17:02.080
So she must have been killed
on the way there.

17:02.080 --> 17:06.650
Looking at her designs,
ella actually had talent.

17:06.650 --> 17:09.619
Yeah, well, the question
is, what did she know,

17:09.619 --> 17:11.589
And did someone kill her
to keep her quiet?

17:11.589 --> 17:12.819
Ryan: Well,
I can't help you out there,

17:12.829 --> 17:14.960
But I can tell you
that marcus conway

17:14.960 --> 17:17.800
Was telling the truth
about not planting that bug.

17:17.800 --> 17:19.260
Yeah, the serial number
led us to a distributor

17:19.270 --> 17:20.670
Named alternate intelligence

a month ago.

When we found out he
was former special forces and,

17:30.210 --> 17:32.740
Not to mention, the head of
security at <i>modern fashion.</i>

17:32.750 --> 17:35.750

and he identified you

18:12.990 --> 18:16.190
As the exterminator
he let into her apartment.

18:16.190 --> 18:18.890
I had nothing to do with
what happened to ella hayes.

18:18.890 --> 18:21.690
You broke into her place,
you wired it for sound,

18:21.700 --> 18:22.760
And now she's dead?

18:22.760 --> 18:23.930
James?

18:23.930 --> 18:25.800
Think about
how that looks, bro.

18:25.800 --> 18:28.570
Your best bet is to tell us
exactly what you know.

18:28.570 --> 18:33.200
All I did was bug her place,
okay?

18:33.210 --> 18:36.270
I mean, once glen carter
bought the magazine,

18:36.280 --> 18:39.240
Home monitoring
got to be a common practice.

18:39.250 --> 18:41.680
So, glen carter
ordered the surveillance?
No.

18:41.680 --> 18:44.120
No, he didn't know
anything about it.

18:44.120 --> 18:45.720
It was ordered
by matilda king.

18:47.850 --> 18:50.160
Matilda king.

18:50.160 --> 18:52.720
You sure about that?
Yes, I'm sure.

18:52.730 --> 18:56.330
She got all freaked out about
someone coming after her job,

18:56.330 --> 18:59.000
So she said she didn't know
who she could trust anymore.

18:59.000 --> 19:01.930
Okay, so, who monitored the
audio from ella's apartment?

19:01.940 --> 19:04.200
Matilda had me set it up

19:04.200 --> 19:07.640
So that it fed directly
to her computer.

19:07.640 --> 19:08.770
You realize what this means?

19:09.780 --> 19:11.940
Yeah.

19:11.950 --> 19:14.750
Ella called marcus conway
on the landline,

19:14.750 --> 19:17.080
Told him she could take down
the magazine,

19:17.080 --> 19:18.280
And matilda heard
the whole thing.

19:18.290 --> 19:21.320
Okay.
Thank you very much.

19:21.320 --> 19:24.160
So, the guard in the lobby
of the <i>modern fashion</i> building

19:24.160 --> 19:26.930
Saw matilda leave there
last night at 11:30,

19:26.930 --> 19:28.260
And she was in
a big hurry.

19:28.260 --> 19:32.930
Well, that's right after
ella called marcus conway.

19:32.930 --> 19:34.330
Matilda knew that ella
was about to spill the beans

19:34.330 --> 19:35.230
And bring down the magazine.

19:35.240 --> 19:38.270
So matilda went to stop her.

19:38.270 --> 19:40.410
She's our killer.

19:50.150 --> 19:51.920
Wait, wait, wait.
She's on a call.

19:51.920 --> 19:52.820
She can call back.

19:54.950 --> 19:59.420
Matilda:
Glen, this magazine is not about
tweets or likes on facebook,

19:59.430 --> 20:00.730
For god's sake!

20:00.730 --> 20:02.130
For 57 years,

this magazine for the fashion!

at work or at home,

We are their escape!
We are their fantasy!

20:14.270 --> 20:17.140
It's the clothing
that stitches it all together.

It's not temper.
It's frustration.

Glen carter, our new owner,

20:41.130 --> 20:43.270
Cares more about money
than fashion.

20:43.270 --> 20:46.140
Is that why you were paranoid
he was gonna replace you?

I don't know what you've heard,
but I'm matilda king.

20:51.180 --> 20:55.150
My name is synonymous
with this magazine.

20:55.150 --> 20:57.880
He wouldn't dare replace me.

20:57.880 --> 20:59.450
So then why did you order
the monitoring

20:59.450 --> 21:01.790
Of all of your employees'
conversations

21:13.300 --> 21:18.200
Since the purchase,
rumors have been swirling.

21:18.210 --> 21:20.140
I'd like to think
that they're just rumors,

21:20.140 --> 21:21.910
But I can't afford
to take that chance.

21:21.910 --> 21:24.440
I need to know
my people are loyal.

21:24.440 --> 21:27.150
By bugging their homes?

21:28.350 --> 21:31.850
With their permission.

21:31.850 --> 21:34.090
We've had
some loyalty issues,

21:34.090 --> 21:36.250
So my lawyers added
some fine print

21:36.260 --> 21:37.760
To their
employment agreements.

21:37.760 --> 21:41.930
Do you actually believe
that's gonna fly in court?

21:41.930 --> 21:45.130
My lawyers
seem to think so.

21:45.130 --> 21:48.900
Now, what does this have to do
with your investigation?

21:48.900 --> 21:50.800
Look, given the rumors
about your job,

21:50.800 --> 21:53.100
It must have been disconcerting
to find out ella

21:53.110 --> 21:55.070
Was taking damaging information
on <i>modern fashion</i>

21:55.080 --> 21:58.840
To what are you referring?
What information?

21:58.850 --> 22:04.780
But what we do know is moments
after she made the arrangements

22:04.790 --> 22:06.220
To sell that information,

22:06.220 --> 22:08.250
You were seen
running out of here.

that you're desperate to defend.

22:26.110 --> 22:28.140
That's motive
and that's opportunity.

22:28.140 --> 22:30.180
I ran out of my office
last night

22:30.180 --> 22:33.310
Because I was late for drinks
with oscar de la renta.

22:34.280 --> 22:36.550

to the magazine,

I never heard her say that.

22:42.820 --> 22:45.390

She was having drinks with oscar

to the competition.

something on these audio files

shed light on that.

of inane conversations

28:44.780 --> 28:46.620
[ inhales sharply ]

28:49.350 --> 28:50.920
Well, t-this probably
would have

28:50.920 --> 28:53.260
Looked better on the model
that didn't show up.

28:53.260 --> 28:56.930
No, don't be silly.
It's perfect on you.

28:56.930 --> 28:58.260
Trust me.
I'm an expert.

28:58.260 --> 29:00.230
[ chuckles softly ]

29:00.230 --> 29:04.870
This is exactly the kind
of dress I would want for her.

29:04.870 --> 29:08.540
You are gonna make
a beautiful bride someday.

29:08.540 --> 29:09.540
Thank you.

29:09.540 --> 29:13.740
We're ready for the accessories
spread in the conference room.

29:13.750 --> 29:17.250
Excuse me.
I'll be back in five minutes.

29:22.620 --> 29:24.690
Wow.

29:26.630 --> 29:28.390
[ chuckles softly ]

29:40.740 --> 29:42.310
[ cellphone rings ]

29:50.020 --> 29:52.350
[ cellphone beeps ]

29:52.350 --> 29:56.290
Hey.
How's the venue.

29:56.290 --> 29:58.790
[ chuckles ] amazing.
Yeah, <i>so</i> amazing.

29:58.790 --> 30:02.890
And they didn't have any spots
open until fall of 2015,

30:02.900 --> 30:08.330
And their unfortunate misery
can be our lifelong joy.

30:08.330 --> 30:12.540
We can take their spot
for the spring.

30:12.540 --> 30:15.810
The spring. Wow.

30:15.810 --> 30:18.740
I know. And there's a lot
of couples who want it.

30:18.750 --> 30:22.410
But if I put down a deposit
tonight, it's ours.

30:24.280 --> 30:26.350
So, what do you say?

30:31.760 --> 30:32.820
Beckett, are you there?

30:34.890 --> 30:36.960
Yeah.

30:42.900 --> 30:46.540
Okay, but I-I thought we agreed
that the venue was amazing.

30:46.540 --> 30:49.440
Yeah, we did. It's just
I started thinking
about the details

30:49.440 --> 30:51.780
And the planning that we
have to do, and I just --

30:51.780 --> 30:53.440
I don't want to rush
any of this.

30:53.450 --> 30:54.780
Okay.
If you're sure that's it.

30:54.780 --> 30:55.980
Yeah. Yeah, it is.

30:55.980 --> 30:57.450
I -- [ sighs ]

30:57.450 --> 30:59.380
I mean, we're gonna find
another venue, castle.

31:02.650 --> 31:04.920
So, a tech was able
to track down that I.P. Address.

31:04.920 --> 31:07.860
Whoever changed that
calendar did it from a
design studio in soho.

31:07.860 --> 31:09.790
Is there any connection between
the studio and <i>modern fashion?</i>

31:09.800 --> 31:11.400
As a matter of fact,
there is.

31:11.400 --> 31:13.460
It belongs to one
of the designers being featured

31:13.470 --> 31:16.970
In <i>modern fashion's</i>
<i>"fab five" spread -- yumi.</i>

31:16.970 --> 31:17.970
Yumi what?

31:17.970 --> 31:21.410
I guess if you don't have a last
name, you can charge more.

31:21.410 --> 31:24.840
So, why would he
or someone from his studio

31:24.840 --> 31:26.040
Be changing
matilda's calendar?

31:26.050 --> 31:27.910
I don't know,
but I can tell you this.

31:27.910 --> 31:29.950
It looks like ella
may have been there
the night she was killed.

31:29.950 --> 31:32.350
How do you know that?
Yumi's website.

31:32.350 --> 31:34.820
The current design line
being produced at his studio

31:34.820 --> 31:37.360
Features dresses
embellished with coral,

31:37.360 --> 31:39.990
And, in addition to the fact
that this model is hot,

31:39.990 --> 31:41.790
She's wearing black coral.

31:41.790 --> 31:43.930
The same kind of coral
that lanie found

31:43.930 --> 31:46.400
Stuck to the bottom
of ella's shoe.
Let's go.

31:46.400 --> 31:48.830
I'm probably gonna have to call
her in for an interrogation.

31:48.840 --> 31:49.830
Yumi:
No, sweetie.

31:49.840 --> 31:51.600
You tell
little miss all that

31:51.600 --> 31:53.440
Yumi says there's only one diva
in this room.

31:53.440 --> 31:55.370
If she doesn't want to wear
the pink louboutins,

31:55.380 --> 31:56.910
She is out of the show.

31:56.910 --> 31:58.810
[ sighs ]
models.

31:58.810 --> 32:01.050
The lack of food makes them
so very fraught.

32:01.050 --> 32:04.480
Uh, mr. Yumi --
please, just yumi.

32:04.480 --> 32:06.980
Okay. Yumi.

32:06.990 --> 32:08.820
When was the last time
you saw ella hayes?

32:08.820 --> 32:10.420
Ella hayes?

32:10.420 --> 32:12.720
Matilda's assistant --
the girl who was killed?

32:12.730 --> 32:14.630
Yes, of course.

32:14.630 --> 32:16.960
Well, we have reason to believe
that she was here last night.

32:16.960 --> 32:19.560
Yes. She was.

32:19.570 --> 32:21.870
Why was she here?

32:21.870 --> 32:23.600
She, uh, she came to ask me
for a job.

32:23.600 --> 32:24.770
Really?

32:24.770 --> 32:26.070
I told her
I wanted to help,

32:26.070 --> 32:27.840
But there was absolutely
nothing I could do.

32:27.840 --> 32:32.580
When matilda king fires someone,
they are radioactive.

32:32.580 --> 32:34.180
Do you have any idea
why she was fired?

32:34.180 --> 32:35.880
No.

32:35.880 --> 32:37.480
I think you do.

32:37.480 --> 32:40.520
Someone changed matilda king's
calendar.

32:40.520 --> 32:42.150
Matilda thought it was ella,
but it wasn't ella.

32:42.160 --> 32:44.090
It was someone
from your studio.

32:44.090 --> 32:46.190
We traced
the I.P. Address.

32:46.190 --> 32:48.960
That's what she was doing here
last night.

32:48.960 --> 32:51.800
She wasn't asking
for a job.

32:51.800 --> 32:55.000
She was looking to find
who made those changes --

32:55.000 --> 32:56.630
Who ruined her career.

32:56.640 --> 32:58.000
And given the fact
that you just lied to us,

32:58.000 --> 32:59.840
I am guessing it was you.

32:59.840 --> 33:01.840
Me?
[ laughs ]

33:01.840 --> 33:04.780
Do you have any idea
how powerful matilda king is

33:04.780 --> 33:06.110
In the fashion industry?

33:06.110 --> 33:08.880
My design
is a "fab five" winner.

33:08.880 --> 33:10.980
Matilda's about
to make me famous.

33:10.980 --> 33:13.820
Messing with her
would be career suicide.

33:13.820 --> 33:16.820
What could possibly
be my motive?

33:16.820 --> 33:17.820
Oh, it's simple.

33:17.820 --> 33:20.220
You needed
to get her fired.

33:20.230 --> 33:22.130
You needed
to discredit her.

33:22.130 --> 33:24.900
Why on earth
would I do that?

33:24.900 --> 33:27.530
Because your winning
"fab five" design...

33:29.130 --> 33:32.100
...Isn't yours.

33:32.100 --> 33:34.740
From ella's sketchbook.

33:34.740 --> 33:36.040
They're exactly the same.

33:36.040 --> 33:38.580
Ella was
an aspiring designer.

33:38.580 --> 33:39.940
She must have copied me.

33:39.950 --> 33:41.150
No. Ella's roommate

33:41.150 --> 33:43.550
Saw her making those sketches
months ago.

33:43.550 --> 33:44.820
Okay, then.

33:44.820 --> 33:46.680
If you found it
in her sketchbook,

33:46.690 --> 33:47.920
Then how did I get it?

33:47.920 --> 33:49.890
Well, matilda's other assistant,
grace,

33:49.890 --> 33:52.860
Confirmed seeing ella
give you copies of her sketches.

33:52.860 --> 33:54.490
Apparently,
you had them on you

33:54.490 --> 33:56.590
When you went in on your
"fab five" pitch meeting.

33:56.600 --> 33:59.030
And from there,
the story writes itself.

33:59.030 --> 34:00.930
You showed your designs,

34:00.930 --> 34:02.870
And they just weren't
good enough to make the cut,

34:02.870 --> 34:05.900
But then the artistic director
sees these in your bag --

34:05.910 --> 34:08.540
The fresh, stunning,
raw talent --

34:08.540 --> 34:10.040
Perfect for the "fab five."

34:10.040 --> 34:11.880
Except they weren't
<i>your</i> designs.

34:11.880 --> 34:14.610
Only two people knew that --
you and ella.

34:14.610 --> 34:16.780
And being
a "fab five" designer

34:16.780 --> 34:18.020
Could literally
make your career,

34:18.020 --> 34:20.920
Once you were chosen
for the "fab five,"

34:20.920 --> 34:25.190
You realized that ella would
know you had stolen her designs.

34:25.190 --> 34:27.590
You had to discredit her so
that no one would believe her.

34:30.929 --> 34:32.900
I want a lawyer.

34:35.770 --> 34:38.670
Ella must have confronted yumi
at his studio.

34:38.670 --> 34:41.270
If she threatened to
expose the whole scandal,
his career would be over.

34:41.270 --> 34:44.070
He had to kill her
to hide the truth.
Yeah.
That all makes sense.

34:44.080 --> 34:45.980
Now we just have to connect him
to the crime scene.

34:45.980 --> 34:48.110
Only one problem --
you can't.

34:48.110 --> 34:49.179
Yumi didn't kill ella.

34:49.179 --> 34:50.710
How do you know?

34:50.719 --> 34:52.880
Multiple employees
saw ella confront yumi,

34:52.889 --> 34:55.790
But after she took off, he
was at the studio till 3:00 a.M.

34:55.790 --> 34:57.990
Wait. Are you --
are you sure?

34:57.990 --> 35:01.760
But we know someone
changed matilda's calendar

35:01.760 --> 35:02.730
From that studio.

35:02.730 --> 35:04.160
He has to be involved somehow.

35:04.160 --> 35:05.830
I think someone else was,
too.

35:05.830 --> 35:07.300
I went through yumi's
phone records,

35:07.300 --> 35:09.130
And after ella left,

35:09.140 --> 35:12.340
He made half a dozen phone calls
to <i>modern fashion.</i>

35:18.780 --> 35:21.310
Such beautiful designs.

35:21.310 --> 35:24.580
After all this time,
I had no idea.

35:24.580 --> 35:26.950
If she knew these designs
had been stolen,

35:26.950 --> 35:29.950
Maybe she didn't think
you would listen --

35:29.960 --> 35:32.020
At least, not to someone
like her.

35:32.020 --> 35:33.960
Maybe she just wanted
revenge.

35:33.960 --> 35:39.860
If   <i>couture chi</i> exposed that
our "fab five" list was corrupt,

35:39.870 --> 35:41.030
It would have cost me
my job.

35:41.030 --> 35:43.030
Who else stood to lose?

35:43.040 --> 35:45.640
Everyone involved,
I suppose.

35:45.640 --> 35:47.340
Well, just after ella
left yumi's studio,

35:47.340 --> 35:49.340
He made a series
of phone calls

35:49.340 --> 35:51.610
To someone here
at <i>modern fashion.</i>

35:51.610 --> 35:54.080
Someone who must have known
yumi's secret --

35:54.080 --> 35:55.810
Who was helping him
cover it up.

35:55.820 --> 35:57.380
Someone who knew that
if the truth got out,

35:57.380 --> 35:58.920
It could destroy them both.

35:58.920 --> 36:00.650
[ sighs ]

36:00.650 --> 36:03.920
There's only one person
it could be.

36:03.920 --> 36:05.860
Who?

36:09.830 --> 36:11.800
We go to print in one week
on this issue,

36:11.800 --> 36:13.900
And I'm still not happy
with the cover options.

36:13.900 --> 36:17.300
And we're still not there
with the "fab five" spread!

36:17.300 --> 36:19.300
Now, go, please,
make it better!

36:21.810 --> 36:23.840
Julian, a word.

36:25.280 --> 36:26.710
[ door closes ]

36:26.710 --> 36:28.680
What was your
first reaction

36:28.680 --> 36:30.650
When you saw yumi's
design submission?

36:30.650 --> 36:31.950
Blown away.

36:31.950 --> 36:34.350
I mean,
that's why I nominated him.

36:34.350 --> 36:37.420
Now, is there a reason
why you didn't come to me

36:37.420 --> 36:39.390
And tell me
when he confessed to you

36:39.390 --> 36:42.130
That he stole ella's design?

36:42.130 --> 36:43.790
What do you mean?

36:43.800 --> 36:45.830
I had a word with yumi
this morning.

36:45.830 --> 36:47.900
He told me you've known
for a while.

36:47.900 --> 36:51.670
And he also said it was your
idea to change my calendar.

36:51.670 --> 36:53.270
He's lying.

36:53.270 --> 36:56.440
Then I spoke to mr. Carter,

36:56.440 --> 36:59.710
And he confirmed
my suspicion.

36:59.710 --> 37:01.450
You've been gunning
for my job.

37:02.920 --> 37:07.420
It proves that you tried to kill
two birds with one stone.

37:07.420 --> 37:10.390
You changed my calendar
in order to discredit ella

37:10.390 --> 37:16.060
You don't know
what you're talking about.
Don't even.

37:16.060 --> 37:17.290
You're fired.

37:20.100 --> 37:24.270
I can walk out of here and
get hired at any magazine I want

37:24.270 --> 37:26.700
By the end of the day.

37:28.940 --> 37:32.180
You won't be applying for
a new job anytime soon, julian.

37:32.180 --> 37:33.010
[ scoffs ]
oh, my...

37:33.010 --> 37:35.880
This is ridiculous.

37:35.880 --> 37:37.410
Matilda king --

37:37.420 --> 37:40.850
She takes pleasure
in torturing people like this.

37:40.850 --> 37:45.920
Fact is, her story
is as crazy as she is.

37:45.930 --> 37:49.130
Except we searched the dumpsters
around your apartment,

37:49.130 --> 37:51.130
And we found
ella's scarf --

37:51.130 --> 37:53.460
The one that you used
to strangle her.

37:53.470 --> 37:57.270
The lab also found two sets
of dna on that scarf --

37:57.270 --> 37:59.340
Ella's and yours.

38:01.810 --> 38:04.510
I'm not gonna say another word
until my lawyer's present.

38:08.980 --> 38:10.750
Ryan:
So, what did the d.A. Say?

38:10.750 --> 38:13.350
[ sighs ] that julian's
gonna plead not guilty,

38:13.350 --> 38:18.120
The good news is yumi cut a deal
to avoid charges.

38:18.120 --> 38:20.990
I guess murder
is not his type of accessory.

38:20.990 --> 38:23.760
Yeah. He confessed
to telling julian

38:23.760 --> 38:27.460
And julian told him
that he would take care of her.

38:27.470 --> 38:28.770
So, I guess the "fab five"

38:28.770 --> 38:32.340
I always thought the fashion
industry seemed glamorous.

38:32.340 --> 38:33.900
Turns out,
mobsters are more ethical.

38:33.910 --> 38:35.470
Oh, my gosh.
Why do you think I quit?

38:35.470 --> 38:37.240
I'll take murderers over models
any day.

38:37.240 --> 38:39.510
If only murderers
were this hot.

38:40.810 --> 38:42.510
I got a bit of paperwork
to do.

38:42.520 --> 38:44.880
Ah! Boring paperwork.

38:44.880 --> 38:46.380
That is my cue to leave.

38:46.390 --> 38:50.820
Yeah. Yeah, I'll see you
when I'm done.

38:50.820 --> 38:52.090

Hey.
Shall I pour you a glass?

40:18.240 --> 40:21.110
Uh, no.
Not right now.

40:21.110 --> 40:23.080
Everything all right?

40:26.250 --> 40:28.120
Babe, we have to talk.

40:30.460 --> 40:33.620
Wow. That's something people say
before they deliver bad news.

40:34.590 --> 40:36.390
Um...

40:39.200 --> 40:43.530
...You know when you called
last night about the venue?

40:43.540 --> 40:46.670
I was with matilda, and she
wanted me to model a dress.

40:49.340 --> 40:51.170
And it was
a wedding dress.

40:54.010 --> 40:56.010
And when I saw myself in it,
I just --

40:56.020 --> 40:57.510
I started to think
about my mom.

40:57.520 --> 41:00.320
She would have loved to have
been a part of all of this,

41:00.320 --> 41:05.290
To help pick out the flowers
and try on the dresses and...

41:05.290 --> 41:07.520
When I looked at myself
in the mirror, I just --

41:07.530 --> 41:11.130
I-I halfway expected
to see her right behind me...

41:11.130 --> 41:15.230
And, just for a moment,
I thought to myself,

41:15.230 --> 41:17.970
"I don't know if I can do
all of this without her."

41:19.540 --> 41:23.170
And that's why I said no
when you asked about the venue.

41:23.180 --> 41:25.540
I'm so sorry.
It was so stupid.

41:25.540 --> 41:28.110
No.

41:28.110 --> 41:30.180
No, not stupid.

41:30.180 --> 41:31.980
Human.

41:35.350 --> 41:39.360
Do you know what else I wish
she could experience?

41:39.360 --> 41:40.260
You.

41:40.260 --> 41:42.130
Really?
Yeah.

41:42.130 --> 41:44.560
She would have loved you.

41:48.600 --> 41:51.070
You know, kate...

41:51.070 --> 41:52.300
If you need more time --

41:52.300 --> 41:55.240
No. No, I don't --
I don't need any more time.

41:55.240 --> 41:57.540
I don't even want us
to wait until the fall.

41:57.540 --> 41:59.440
I think we can find
a new venue in the spring.

42:00.980 --> 42:02.410
You think
we can pull it off?

42:02.410 --> 42:04.380
Yeah.

42:04.380 --> 42:05.720
I mean,
I already have the dress.

42:06.305 --> 42:12.532
