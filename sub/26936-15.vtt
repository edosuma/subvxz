WEBVTT

00:00.890 --> 00:02.490
Tonight on The Curse of Oak Island...

00:03.199 --> 00:04.510
MARTY:
It's time to re-do

00:04.510 --> 00:05.540
the dye test.

00:05.540 --> 00:07.410
We're gonna get everybody lined
out here real quick.

00:07.410 --> 00:09.150
see if that red dye
comes out and where

00:09.150 --> 00:10.790
-We're ready to begin.
-Let's do this.

00:10.790 --> 00:12.420
MARTY:
Here comes the water.

00:12.420 --> 00:13.420
Whoa!

00:13.420 --> 00:14.420
TERRY:
Cut! Cut!

00:14.420 --> 00:15.420
Kill it! Kill the pump!

00:15.420 --> 00:17.619
RICK: There's no treasure
in the world

00:17.619 --> 00:19.640
-worth anyone getting hurt.
-JACK: There's some

00:19.640 --> 00:22.320
weird anomaly in the water.
-TONY: We're on our way.

00:22.320 --> 00:23.920
-JACK: What is that?
-MARTY: If we've got red dye

00:23.920 --> 00:24.920
in Smith's Cove,
I might become a believer.

00:24.920 --> 00:27.630
-GARY: Here it is! Look!
-Oh, I think I see it.

00:27.630 --> 00:30.380
GARY:
That's the red, guys.

00:30.380 --> 00:33.050
NARRATOR:
There is an island

00:33.050 --> 00:35.210
in the North Atlantic

00:35.210 --> 00:42.010
where people have been looking
for an incredible treasure

00:42.010 --> 00:43.010
for more than 200 years.

00:43.010 --> 00:44.789
So far, they have found
a stone slab

00:44.789 --> 00:47.329
with strange symbols carved
into it,

00:47.329 --> 00:50.760
mysterious fragments
of human bone,

00:50.760 --> 00:54.289
and a lead cross whose origin
may stretch back

00:54.289 --> 00:56.699
to the days
of the Knights Templar.

00:56.699 --> 01:01.320
To date, six men have died
trying to solve the mystery.

01:01.320 --> 01:03.320
And, according to legend,

01:03.320 --> 01:06.320
one more will have to die

01:06.320 --> 01:18.270
before the treasure
can be found.

01:18.270 --> 01:24.760
NARRATOR: It is a morning of
grave concern on Oak Island...

01:24.760 --> 01:25.850
-Morning.
-Morning.

01:25.850 --> 01:28.290
...as Rick Lagina
and Craig Tester

01:28.290 --> 01:31.850
investigate the extent
of the damage caused

01:31.850 --> 01:33.420
by a large sinkhole

01:33.420 --> 01:35.549
that developed
in the Money Pit drill site

01:35.549 --> 01:36.549
two days ago.

01:36.549 --> 01:41.680
-How's it lookin'?
-Vanessa is in there with Irving

01:41.680 --> 01:43.799
discussing exactly how
we're gonna move forward.

01:43.799 --> 01:44.990
-Okay.
-So...

01:44.990 --> 01:46.180
-Is there...

01:46.180 --> 01:48.880
another problem that
has reared its head, or...?

01:48.880 --> 01:52.180
No, she just told me not to...
not to do anything just yet

01:52.180 --> 01:55.110
until they get some stuff
worked out with the engineer

01:55.110 --> 01:57.000
and all that other stuff.

01:57.000 --> 02:00.600
-Yeah, it don't look any worser.
-Okay.

02:00.600 --> 02:02.659
DANNY:
Oh, hell no.

02:02.659 --> 02:06.409
See how the ground's gone?
It's caving.

02:06.409 --> 02:08.470
The sinkhole occurred
while the team

02:08.470 --> 02:11.920
was excavating the borehole
known as H-8,

02:11.920 --> 02:14.360
which many suspect
could be the location

02:14.360 --> 02:16.680
of the original
Oak Island Money Pit.

02:16.680 --> 02:18.930
So we can definitely
continue to dig

02:18.930 --> 02:20.790
-with the hammer-grab, but..
-Oh, really?

02:20.790 --> 02:23.060
...we want to go forward
with caution.

02:23.060 --> 02:26.200
Although at first it wasn't
considered serious enough

02:26.200 --> 02:27.970
to threaten the operation...

02:27.970 --> 02:30.840
-Oh, baby.
-CHARLES: Be careful.

02:30.840 --> 02:33.599
...within 24 hours,
the ground surrounding

02:33.599 --> 02:35.360
the 50-inch-wide caisson

02:35.360 --> 02:39.680
-collapsed much further.
-RICK: What the hell is...?

02:39.680 --> 02:40.680
-(rumbling)
-Oh, no, no!

02:40.680 --> 02:41.680
-Whoa, whoa!

02:41.680 --> 02:42.680
...to the point
where it may no longer

02:42.680 --> 02:43.680
-be safe to continue.
-MARTY: One of these days,

02:43.680 --> 02:44.680
we're all

02:44.680 --> 02:47.630
gonna be standing here
and just disappear.

02:47.630 --> 02:48.980
RICK:
We'll see what

02:48.980 --> 02:50.100
their concerns are.

02:50.100 --> 02:51.100
-CRAIG:
Yep.

02:51.100 --> 02:52.340
-Obviously, there may be a...

02:52.340 --> 02:53.720
a new issue or two.

02:53.720 --> 02:54.909
-Hello.
-Hi, Craig.

02:54.909 --> 02:55.909
-Morning.

02:55.909 --> 02:57.690
MARK:
Have a seat, guys.

02:57.690 --> 03:01.750
Have you guys had a chance to
discuss our problem out there?

03:01.750 --> 03:04.870
Yeah. Didn't like
coming to that this morning.

03:04.870 --> 03:05.870
Yeah.

03:05.870 --> 03:08.640
RICK:
It was a...

03:08.640 --> 03:09.660
-serious concern, right?
-VANESSA:

03:09.660 --> 03:10.660
Yeah.

03:10.660 --> 03:11.660
We don't know what's happening.

03:11.660 --> 03:13.390
You know, uh...

03:13.390 --> 03:14.940
huge safety concerns.

03:14.940 --> 03:17.099
But we're hoping
that we can mitigate

03:17.099 --> 03:21.159
the problem and-and address it
and move on, but...

03:21.159 --> 03:23.640
obviously, we're gonna defer
to both of you.

03:23.640 --> 03:25.420
-Sure.
-So having said that,

03:25.420 --> 03:27.069
what have you come up with?

03:27.069 --> 03:28.420
Really, now,
we're gonna be monitoring

03:28.420 --> 03:30.400
the whole area
of the ground, right?

03:30.400 --> 03:33.739
Because this area has been
so heavily excavated

03:33.739 --> 03:36.680
and compromised and, um,
I kind of use the analogy

03:36.680 --> 03:38.489
it's been Swiss-cheesed,
you know?

03:38.489 --> 03:41.290
So we're really not sure
what's going on in there.

03:41.290 --> 03:43.450
Um, and that makes us concerned.

03:43.450 --> 03:46.739
NARRATOR:
For more than two centuries,

03:46.739 --> 03:48.519
hundreds of Oak Island
treasure hunters

03:48.519 --> 03:51.459
have dug dozens
of shafts and holes

03:51.459 --> 03:53.260
in an attempt
to reach the bottom

03:53.260 --> 03:54.939
of the so-called Money Pit.

03:54.939 --> 03:58.019
Because of this--
and the fact that the area

03:58.019 --> 04:00.220
has been further compromised
by water

04:00.220 --> 04:03.159
from underground
flood tunnels--

04:03.159 --> 04:04.159
the ground
beneath the Money Pit

04:04.159 --> 04:08.260
is susceptible to cave-ins.

04:08.260 --> 04:11.810
I guess as a starting point,
um, you know,

04:11.810 --> 04:13.920
there is quite a...
quite a hole there.

04:13.920 --> 04:17.510
Um, we need to fill that back
in, but we want to do it right.

04:17.510 --> 04:18.720
One of the suggestions
that came up

04:18.720 --> 04:21.160
was to put the vibro hammer
on the H-8,

04:21.160 --> 04:23.040
-Mm-hmm.
-um...

04:23.040 --> 04:26.250
shake it up a little bit,
and, uh, and see what happens

04:26.250 --> 04:27.980
-from there.
-Okay.

04:27.980 --> 04:32.110
A vibro hammer is
a massive hydraulic tool

04:32.110 --> 04:33.230
which will literally shake

04:33.230 --> 04:36.160
the giant,
50-inch-wide steel caisson.

04:36.160 --> 04:39.300
Although this will cause
more earth to cave in,

04:39.300 --> 04:42.260
the hope is that it will
eventually cause the ground

04:42.260 --> 04:46.840
around the H-8 shaft to settle
and become stabilized.

04:46.840 --> 04:49.720
However, there is also a chance

04:49.720 --> 04:51.750
that this process
could cause the sinkhole

04:51.750 --> 04:53.730
to become much larger

04:53.730 --> 04:56.260
and possibly trigger
a catastrophic cave-in.

04:56.260 --> 04:59.040
(rumbling)

04:59.040 --> 05:02.180
The one thing that
is helping me not...

05:02.180 --> 05:04.490
completely telling you guys,
"Hey, we're outta here,"

05:04.490 --> 05:06.750
(laughs): is that
this seems to be a very

05:06.750 --> 05:08.050
isolated collapse.

05:08.050 --> 05:09.980
-Okay.
-We're not seeing crowning.

05:09.980 --> 05:11.000
We're not seeing spiders.

05:11.000 --> 05:12.740
We're not seeing indication that

05:12.740 --> 05:14.840
there's something bigger
going out underneath.

05:14.840 --> 05:17.890
It doesn't mean something bigger
is not brewing.

05:17.890 --> 05:19.360
-Okay.
-So we're really gonna have

05:19.360 --> 05:20.360
to monitor this

05:20.360 --> 05:21.810
and take lots
of safety precautions.

05:21.810 --> 05:23.810
-Sounds good to me.
-Yep.

05:23.810 --> 05:28.000
All right.
So the next step is vibrate.

05:28.000 --> 05:29.180
-Yep. And we're ready.
-Okay.

05:29.180 --> 05:30.180
-Thank you very much.
-Thanks, guys.

05:30.180 --> 05:31.180
-Thank you.

05:31.180 --> 05:32.180
RICK: They have
some serious concerns,

05:32.180 --> 05:34.670
because they do not understand
what's happening underground.

05:34.670 --> 05:36.210
I've gone on record as saying

05:36.210 --> 05:39.060
there's no treasure
in the world worth, uh,

05:39.060 --> 05:40.920
anyone getting hurt.

05:40.920 --> 05:44.180
"Can we continue?"
is the greater question,

05:44.180 --> 05:47.110
and that,
I still have hope for H-8.

05:47.110 --> 05:51.140
Are we good to go?

05:51.140 --> 05:53.560
-Tickle it.
-Okay.

05:53.560 --> 05:55.170
(switch clicks)

05:55.170 --> 05:59.230
RICK:
Look at that thing.

05:59.230 --> 06:06.770
-CHARLES: Wow.
-CRAIG: There's a lot

06:06.770 --> 06:07.820
of loose material

06:07.820 --> 06:09.890
-coming out of there.
-CHARLES: Yeah.

06:09.890 --> 06:12.650
VANESSA:
We could open it up some more.

06:12.650 --> 06:14.380
He's got it wide open.

06:14.380 --> 06:15.760
RICK:
There she goes.

06:15.760 --> 06:16.760
Oh!

06:16.760 --> 06:18.440
NARRATION: As the team
from Irving Equipment Limited

06:18.440 --> 06:22.090
begins their efforts
at the Money Pit site,

06:22.090 --> 06:24.520
Marty Lagina, Dave Blankenship,

06:24.520 --> 06:28.260
Jack Begley and metal detection
expert Gary Drayton

06:28.260 --> 06:31.160
meet with heavy equipment
operator Billy Gerhardt

06:31.160 --> 06:33.190
to plan the team's next steps

06:33.190 --> 06:37.120
in their massive search
operation at Smith's Cove.

06:37.120 --> 06:38.790
What is the agenda today, Billy?

06:38.790 --> 06:39.790
-Because...
-Well...

06:39.790 --> 06:42.070
...I would like
to cut trenches over there,

06:42.070 --> 06:43.670
'cause that's probably my focus,

06:43.670 --> 06:45.160
is switching to look for,
you know,

06:45.160 --> 06:47.310
-the box drain if it's there.
-BILLY: If we cut

06:47.310 --> 06:48.310
some deep trenches,

06:48.310 --> 06:49.350
we may intersect
something that's outside.

06:49.350 --> 06:51.830
You just leave enough room,
just leave enough room

06:51.830 --> 06:54.650
-to cut trenches there.
-On... Yeah.

06:54.650 --> 06:56.190
NARRATOR:
Since the Oak Island team

06:56.190 --> 06:59.180
began excavating Smith's Cove
just two months ago,

06:59.180 --> 07:02.310
they have unearthed
a number of incredible

07:02.310 --> 07:06.930
and potentially important
man-made structures.

07:06.930 --> 07:10.180
In addition to finding
both wooden and concrete walls,

07:10.180 --> 07:13.970
they have uncovered the massive
U- and L-shaped structures

07:13.970 --> 07:16.030
first discovered
by Dan Blankenship

07:16.030 --> 07:18.720
in the 1970s.

07:18.720 --> 07:21.340
They have also unearthed
a wooden slipway

07:21.340 --> 07:24.090
which may have been constructed
more than two centuries ago

07:24.090 --> 07:28.580
in order to allow sailing ships
to be hauled onto the island

07:28.580 --> 07:31.000
from the shore.

07:31.000 --> 07:34.190
But perhaps the team's
most exciting discovery so far

07:34.190 --> 07:36.960
has been the finding
of what could be

07:36.960 --> 07:39.970
one of the five
stone box drains

07:39.970 --> 07:42.860
which were built to feed
seawater into the Money Pit

07:42.860 --> 07:46.280
as part of an elaborate
booby trap flooding system.

07:46.280 --> 07:49.550
MARTY: Every structure
out there in Smith's Cove,

07:49.550 --> 07:50.880
you surmise it has

07:50.880 --> 07:53.900
something to do
with the supposed flood tunnel

07:53.900 --> 07:57.680
and the... finger drains,
or box drains.

07:57.680 --> 07:59.220
It's pretty clear
from what we're finding

07:59.220 --> 08:02.760
that massive efforts went on
to build something.

08:02.760 --> 08:05.780
So, what's the plan?

08:05.780 --> 08:06.990
To get rid of this.
We want to clear

08:06.990 --> 08:09.610
from the wall all the way back.

08:09.610 --> 08:11.950
We're looking for the so-called
convergence point.

08:11.950 --> 08:14.430
Okay. Well,
I'm gonna be your eyes.

08:14.430 --> 08:15.700
-I'll stay out of the way
-Oh, all right, okay.

08:15.700 --> 08:17.840
-but be looking
from another direction.

08:17.840 --> 08:18.840
-Okay.

08:18.840 --> 08:20.240
Sounds good.

08:20.240 --> 08:21.910
NARRATOR:
When the box drains

08:21.910 --> 08:24.680
were first discovered in 1850,

08:24.680 --> 08:26.440
members of the Truro Company

08:26.440 --> 08:29.120
reported that
the five finger-like drains

08:29.120 --> 08:30.960
appeared to converge
at the beach

08:30.960 --> 08:33.580
into a single tunnel.

08:33.580 --> 08:36.080
It is Marty's hope that,
by digging a trench

08:36.080 --> 08:38.679
west of the possible
box drain location,

08:38.679 --> 08:41.360
they will be able to find
the convergence point

08:41.360 --> 08:43.860
and then follow the shaft
to the location

08:43.860 --> 08:46.480
of the original Money Pit.

08:46.480 --> 08:50.110
TERRY: Just looking for
an opening beneath these rocks.

08:50.110 --> 08:52.300
That's what we're,
uh, we're hoping for.

08:52.300 --> 08:54.330
Just to see
if we can see any opening

08:54.330 --> 08:57.180
into the, uh, the drains,
the box drains.

08:57.180 --> 09:00.370
-Mm-hmm.
-That's what I'm thinking.

09:00.370 --> 09:04.200
JACK: We're just
scratching the surface.

09:04.200 --> 09:06.120
JACK:
So, Marty,

09:06.120 --> 09:07.550
any box drains yet?

09:07.550 --> 09:09.960
Nope. What I'm
probably gonna do

09:09.960 --> 09:12.740
-is position there
and dig the rest of this up.

09:12.740 --> 09:13.740
-Okay.

09:13.740 --> 09:15.800
NARRATOR:
At Smith's Cove, Marty Lagina,

09:15.800 --> 09:18.320
along with members
of the Oak Island team,

09:18.320 --> 09:21.220
are searching for the remains
of what were reported to be

09:21.220 --> 09:24.560
five stone box drains
that were first discovered

09:24.560 --> 09:28.670
by members
of the Truro Company in 1850.

09:28.670 --> 09:32.900
Marty, I don't think
we ever did fully expose

09:32.900 --> 09:34.080
the bottom of the trench

09:34.080 --> 09:36.670
that was right in front
of Billy's wall,

09:36.670 --> 09:38.290
so we should be sure
to get that deep, at least.

09:38.290 --> 09:39.290
It's right here.

09:39.290 --> 09:45.650
Marty believes that
if they can find more of them,

09:45.650 --> 09:48.260
they might find
a convergence point,

09:48.260 --> 09:51.370
which could lead them directly
to the original Money Pit,

09:51.370 --> 09:54.290
and hopefully, a vast
underground treasure vault.

09:54.390 --> 09:57.860
You got me some gold to find?

09:57.860 --> 10:00.340
-Oh. Hopefully.
-For you, Gary.

10:00.340 --> 10:05.060
-Gary, you want to detect that?
-Yeah.

10:05.060 --> 10:08.070
Going down.

10:08.070 --> 10:12.590
-(rapid beeping)
-Hey!

10:12.590 --> 10:18.220
-GARY: Yeah, that's a good...

10:18.220 --> 10:19.220
that's a good hit, just here.

10:19.220 --> 10:20.220
Fingers crossed.

10:20.220 --> 10:22.150
Is that ferrous, Gary?

10:22.150 --> 10:25.310
Yeah, there's
a big metal target here.

10:25.310 --> 10:28.541
So far, it's registering
as nonferrous, as well.

10:28.541 --> 10:30.560
-That's a good sign.
-That'd be cool.

10:30.560 --> 10:31.700
You want me
to try and pick it up

10:31.700 --> 10:32.850
and dump it
where you can find it?

10:32.850 --> 10:34.640
Yeah, I think
that's the best bet.

10:34.640 --> 10:37.920
It's just too difficult
to recover in the water.

10:37.920 --> 10:44.220
JACK:
You're good, you're good.

10:44.220 --> 10:46.740
Oh, look.

10:46.740 --> 10:49.260
He's on...

10:49.260 --> 10:53.720
Oh. Hopefully he got it.

10:53.720 --> 10:56.420
JACK:
What's this?

10:56.420 --> 10:59.120
GARY:
That's it.

10:59.120 --> 11:00.920
TERRY:
Whoa.

11:00.920 --> 11:01.920
What is it?

11:01.920 --> 11:02.920
-It's a bucket.
-MARTY: A bucket?

11:02.920 --> 11:03.920
GARY:
Yeah, it looks like

11:03.920 --> 11:04.920
a big metal bucket.

11:04.920 --> 11:06.180
JACK:
What's that doing down there?

11:06.180 --> 11:08.440
You want more
dug out of there, Terry?

11:08.440 --> 11:13.150
Uh, yeah. We're not quite to
bottom, but we're getting close.

11:13.150 --> 11:17.610
TERRY:
Yeah.

11:17.610 --> 11:26.520
That's definitely the bottom.

11:26.520 --> 11:33.200
We're on bottom!

11:33.200 --> 11:37.660
NARRATOR:
Unfortunately,

11:37.660 --> 11:39.760
although the team located
what they believe to be

11:39.760 --> 11:42.490
one of the box drains
five weeks ago,

11:42.490 --> 11:45.230
they have, so far,
been unsuccessful

11:45.230 --> 11:46.830
in finding more of them.

11:46.830 --> 11:50.800
-Should we keep digging this?
-No.

11:50.800 --> 11:52.330
When you pulled away,
you couldn't see.

11:52.330 --> 11:54.990
It was mostly sea horizon.
I think we're at the bottom.

11:54.990 --> 11:55.990
Okay.

11:55.990 --> 12:00.140
There might be something
in the spoils, you never know.

12:00.140 --> 12:01.140
-Yeah.
-MARTY: Well, Rick said

12:01.140 --> 12:02.140
there would be answers

12:02.140 --> 12:04.560
in Smith's Cove-- instead,
there are more questions

12:04.560 --> 12:06.050
in Smith's Cove.

12:06.050 --> 12:07.050
TERRY:
Exactly.

12:07.050 --> 12:09.640
MARTY:
Where's the answers?

12:09.640 --> 12:16.240
NARRATOR:
The following morning...

12:16.240 --> 12:18.490
and as efforts to repair
the cave-in surrounding

12:18.490 --> 12:21.830
Borehole H-8 continue
at the Money Pit site...

12:21.830 --> 12:23.750
-MARTY: Hey, Craig.
-Hey, guys.

12:23.750 --> 12:24.900
-Hey, Craig.
-Craig.

12:24.900 --> 12:27.120
NARRATOR:
...Rick and Marty Lagina

12:27.120 --> 12:30.440
call a meeting
in the Oak Island war room.

12:30.440 --> 12:32.130
What we want
to talk about today is,

12:32.130 --> 12:34.820
you know, with Smith's Cove
all excavated,

12:34.820 --> 12:37.640
we could think
about rerunning the dye test.

12:37.640 --> 12:40.140
Because it's
actually possible that...

12:40.140 --> 12:43.170
not only might we see
where it comes out,

12:43.170 --> 12:45.740
we might see
where it doesn't come out.

12:45.740 --> 12:49.100
You know, in other words,
what if we actually blocked off

12:49.100 --> 12:51.310
the entrance
with that big cofferdam?

12:51.310 --> 12:53.029
-Right.
-When we did it

12:53.029 --> 12:55.140
several years ago,
we didn't see anything.

12:55.140 --> 12:56.140
Nowhere.

12:56.140 --> 13:00.279
That's why we want
to redo it, David.

13:00.279 --> 13:01.930
Everybody's got to keep
their heads in the game today,

13:01.930 --> 13:04.420
because we're only gonna have
one shot at this.

13:04.420 --> 13:07.400
NARRATOR: Four years ago,
the Oak Island team

13:07.400 --> 13:10.550
conducted a test
at Borehole 10-X,

13:10.550 --> 13:12.840
one that was first conducted
by veteran treasure hunter

13:12.840 --> 13:15.770
Dan Blankenship
back in the 1970s.

13:15.770 --> 13:20.200
The test involves
putting a colored dye

13:20.200 --> 13:22.760
down an exploratory borehole

13:22.760 --> 13:24.970
and then pumping
air and water into it

13:24.970 --> 13:26.500
to see if the dye
can be spotted

13:26.500 --> 13:29.450
coming out in various places
around the island.

13:29.450 --> 13:32.790
If so, then the test
could reveal the presence

13:32.790 --> 13:35.980
of underground tunnels,
most likely man-made,

13:35.980 --> 13:38.040
which, in turn, could lead back

13:38.040 --> 13:40.670
to the original
Money Pit treasure vault.

13:40.670 --> 13:43.820
RICK:
Here we go.

13:43.820 --> 13:46.670
Unfortunately, the test
the team conducted earlier

13:46.670 --> 13:49.520
used bright green dye.

13:49.520 --> 13:55.540
Because it was hard to spot,
even from the air...

13:55.540 --> 13:58.339
CHARLES: No, man, we don't see
a thing out here at all.

13:58.339 --> 14:01.680
...no underground flood tunnels
were detected.

14:01.680 --> 14:04.710
MARTY:
We all had a consensus back then

14:04.710 --> 14:05.860
that we could have done it
different.

14:05.860 --> 14:08.380
We could use
a different color dye.

14:08.380 --> 14:12.100
And I happen
to have with me here today...

14:12.100 --> 14:13.460
red dye...
(chuckles)

14:13.460 --> 14:15.400
...which we should
be able to see.

14:15.400 --> 14:16.810
-Fluorescent red.
-Yeah.

14:16.810 --> 14:18.930
-Yeah.
-MARTY: We might see it seep out

14:18.930 --> 14:20.150
right into Smith's Cove
somewhere

14:20.150 --> 14:21.430
and then be able
to follow it back

14:21.430 --> 14:23.680
-while we got excavators.
-Yeah.

14:23.680 --> 14:25.940
I think it might be
well worth doing.

14:25.940 --> 14:28.460
-Yeah.
-CHARLES: And Dan Blankenship

14:28.460 --> 14:29.460
has always believed

14:29.460 --> 14:31.070
that there was some type
of hydraulic connection

14:31.070 --> 14:33.510
between Smith's Cove
and the Money Pit area.

14:33.510 --> 14:37.260
So, maybe that will connect
to one of the flooding systems.

14:37.260 --> 14:38.270
Yes.

14:38.270 --> 14:40.450
The goal of the dye test

14:40.450 --> 14:42.020
is to try and shed
a little light

14:42.020 --> 14:44.950
on the constant question
that's in my mind

14:44.950 --> 14:47.800
between artificial
or natural introduction

14:47.800 --> 14:50.200
of seawater
into the Money Pit area.

14:50.200 --> 14:52.470
See whether that flood tunnel
really exists.

14:52.470 --> 14:54.650
And that's what
this endeavor's all about.

14:54.650 --> 14:58.450
Look, if we find
the flood tunnel system,

14:58.450 --> 15:00.890
it proves that
the old story's true.

15:00.890 --> 15:04.430
And how are we
gonna look for the dye?

15:04.430 --> 15:06.589
Out on boats,
or are we gonna just go

15:06.589 --> 15:09.550
to some high points
around Smith's Cove?

15:09.550 --> 15:10.730
That's another good question.

15:10.730 --> 15:12.490
We got a drone,
so we can fly it

15:12.490 --> 15:13.890
-up both sides and see.
-GARY: Yeah,

15:13.890 --> 15:14.890
that makes sense, a drone.

15:14.890 --> 15:17.340
-MARTY: Well, let's get a drone.
-Yeah, I would say so.

15:17.340 --> 15:19.690
RICK: And we're gonna need
a boat, because if we see it

15:19.690 --> 15:22.300
at two separate locations,
we may want to confirm that.

15:22.300 --> 15:24.250
-MARTY: Yeah, I'm all for it.
Let's do it.

15:24.250 --> 15:25.250
-Sounds good.

15:25.250 --> 15:26.871
Okay, I think we've decided
what what we need to do.

15:26.871 --> 15:28.610
Now we need to do it.
Thanks for punching in, Craig.

15:28.610 --> 15:29.610
-Yep.
-We're gonna get after it.

15:29.610 --> 15:31.390
-RICK: See you, Craig.
-CRAIG: Good luck, guys.

15:31.390 --> 15:33.420
-RICK: Thanks, Craig.
-Yep.

15:33.420 --> 15:35.450
NARRATOR:
Later that day...

15:35.450 --> 15:39.180
-MARTY: Here we are.
-PETER: I think this is it.

15:39.180 --> 15:41.690
NARRATOR:
...Marty and Alex Lagina,

15:41.690 --> 15:44.750
along with Jack Begley
and Peter Fornetti,

15:44.750 --> 15:47.700
travel some 60 miles east
of Oak Island

15:47.700 --> 15:50.370
to the city
of Lawrencetown, Nova Scotia.

15:50.370 --> 15:52.130
They are eager to meet

15:52.130 --> 15:55.680
with members of the Centre
of Geographic Sciences,

15:55.680 --> 15:57.560
also known as COGS,

15:57.560 --> 16:01.230
to follow up on the results of
a comprehensive perimeter scan

16:01.230 --> 16:04.420
they recently conducted of the
waters surrounding Oak Island.

16:04.420 --> 16:07.470
JACK: I hope they have
good information for us.

16:07.470 --> 16:10.399
In concert with
the team's upcoming dye test,

16:10.399 --> 16:12.040
they are hoping the results

16:12.040 --> 16:14.080
will help them pinpoint
the location

16:14.080 --> 16:18.110
of a secondary flooding system
which is believed to originate

16:18.110 --> 16:20.420
somewhere off
the island's southern shore.

16:20.420 --> 16:22.710
-Hey, guys.
-Hey. How's it going?

16:22.710 --> 16:23.710
-Hey, guys.

16:23.710 --> 16:25.380
Hey, how are you doing?

16:25.380 --> 16:26.860
MARTY:
We're very excited

16:26.860 --> 16:28.890
about working with this group

16:28.890 --> 16:32.500
to try and add some data
to our search.

16:32.500 --> 16:34.560
We understand that
the offshore data,

16:34.560 --> 16:36.690
the ocean data,
has now been processed,

16:36.690 --> 16:38.680
and they've got
some things to show us.

16:38.680 --> 16:41.210
Okay.
Well, let's see what you found.

16:41.210 --> 16:44.850
So, we'll start off with the
lidar scans that we collected.

16:44.850 --> 16:49.279
We were able to create
a larger point cloud.

16:49.279 --> 16:52.720
If we look at it in 3D...

16:52.720 --> 16:53.720
This is looking down

16:53.720 --> 16:57.839
from the area you guys
are currently investigating.

16:57.839 --> 17:01.430
These two yellow columns
coming up out of the sea floor,

17:01.430 --> 17:04.679
based on coordinates
provided to me by MGO,

17:04.679 --> 17:07.869
are possible vent locations.

17:07.869 --> 17:09.750
NARRATOR:
Vents?

17:09.750 --> 17:11.359
Located on the ocean floor

17:11.359 --> 17:14.559
just off Oak Island's
southern shore?

17:14.559 --> 17:19.520
Could these vents be the cause
of the so-called "ice holes"

17:19.520 --> 17:21.439
which Dan Blankenship believed

17:21.439 --> 17:24.089
were evidence
of a second flood tunnel system

17:24.089 --> 17:25.589
leading to the Money Pit?

17:25.589 --> 17:28.160
DOUG:
So, you picked up

17:28.160 --> 17:32.770
-two possible vents?
-That's right.

17:32.770 --> 17:36.510
To see that the data picked up
that there is something

17:36.510 --> 17:39.520
just south of the swamp that's
producing these ice holes,

17:39.520 --> 17:40.620
it's really cool.

17:40.620 --> 17:43.429
They can't tell at this point
if it's man-made,

17:43.429 --> 17:44.510
but it's worth investigating.

17:44.510 --> 17:47.081
Anyway, keep going.
It's very interesting.

17:47.081 --> 17:50.240
-So, what are all the triangles?
-ALISON: Those are...

17:50.240 --> 17:52.070
-points of interest
we can go through, yeah.

17:52.070 --> 17:53.100
-Points of interest. Okay.

17:53.100 --> 17:54.440
So, this is really interesting.

17:54.440 --> 17:56.040
It's contact ten.

17:56.040 --> 17:59.290
It's located
along the left there.

17:59.290 --> 18:03.670
So, there's
two features here that are...

18:03.670 --> 18:05.280
pointed...

18:05.280 --> 18:07.680
and they're not in the shape
of most of the rocks

18:07.680 --> 18:08.680
that we're seeing.

18:08.680 --> 18:10.530
So if you look
at that really bright fellow,

18:10.530 --> 18:12.360
he's casting
a triangular shadow.

18:12.360 --> 18:13.360
Whoa.

18:13.360 --> 18:17.120
NARRATOR:
A "triangular shadow"?

18:17.120 --> 18:19.800
Might this be an indication
of a connection

18:19.800 --> 18:20.960
between the shadow...

18:20.960 --> 18:24.880
and the triangle-shaped swamp,
as well as other

18:24.880 --> 18:28.110
mysterious triangle-shaped
carvings and symbols

18:28.110 --> 18:30.929
found throughout Oak Island?

18:30.929 --> 18:34.240
ALISON: It's something that's
laying along the seafloor,

18:34.240 --> 18:35.809
but is also shaped
kind of like this.

18:35.809 --> 18:36.809
-Like this?
-Yeah.

18:36.809 --> 18:38.740
-It's vertical,
more or less. Yeah.

18:38.740 --> 18:39.740
-It is. Yeah.

18:39.740 --> 18:41.170
Why is it so bright?

18:41.170 --> 18:43.610
It's something
that's really hard.

18:43.610 --> 18:46.980
-BRIAN P.:
Possibly man-made?

18:46.980 --> 18:47.980
-Yeah.

18:47.980 --> 18:49.760
What's it pointing at?

18:49.760 --> 18:51.059
What's that compass direction?

18:51.059 --> 18:52.830
It is a north-south line.

18:52.830 --> 18:55.080
Yeah, well,
interestingly enough,

18:55.080 --> 19:00.720
that would be pointing,
more or less, at the Money Pit.

19:00.720 --> 19:02.470
The data the students created,
I believe,

19:02.470 --> 19:04.670
is gonna be very valuable to us.

19:04.670 --> 19:09.490
There were targets identified
as mysterious anomalies.

19:09.490 --> 19:11.330
Always worth looking at
on Oak Island.

19:11.330 --> 19:14.260
The data's great.
I want more. More data.

19:14.260 --> 19:15.451
MARTY:
Excellent. Thank you

19:15.451 --> 19:17.050
for all the hard work.

19:17.050 --> 19:19.760
BRIAN P.:
Absolutely.

19:19.760 --> 19:23.730
RICK:
Today, to me, is about

19:23.730 --> 19:25.640
information confirmation,

19:25.640 --> 19:28.920
i.e., you know, we're trying
to prove the old stories,

19:28.920 --> 19:30.940
the legend,
if you will, correct.

19:30.940 --> 19:32.990
NARRATOR:
As a new day dawns,

19:32.990 --> 19:37.250
brothers Rick and Marty Lagina
prepare for the operation

19:37.250 --> 19:39.390
that they hope
will lead them directly

19:39.390 --> 19:43.130
to whatever it is
that's buried on Oak Island.

19:43.130 --> 19:46.140
There's a possible
man-made connection

19:46.140 --> 19:48.630
from the ocean to the Money Pit.

19:48.630 --> 19:49.720
Look, I'm open-minded.

19:49.720 --> 19:52.270
This test has never been run
with Smith's Cove

19:52.270 --> 19:54.220
-both blocked from the sea...
-Right.

19:54.220 --> 19:55.810
...and partially excavated.

19:55.810 --> 19:58.560
-Right.
-So, if we see this dye come out

19:58.560 --> 20:01.580
into Smith's Cove, then we
could maybe follow it back,

20:01.580 --> 20:04.610
and then maybe I become
a believer in a flood tunnel.

20:04.610 --> 20:07.180
The objective
of this whole search--

20:07.180 --> 20:09.549
by "search,"
I mean injecting the red dye--

20:09.549 --> 20:12.890
is to prove or disprove,
or at least shed light

20:12.890 --> 20:16.190
on the existence
of a flood tunnel.

20:16.190 --> 20:19.570
And also help, probably,
locate where it's going,

20:19.570 --> 20:21.840
which means
where the Money Pit is.

20:21.840 --> 20:23.809
NARRATOR:
Now that the drill site

20:23.809 --> 20:25.030
around Borehole H-8

20:25.030 --> 20:27.740
has been stabilized
and reinforced

20:27.740 --> 20:30.080
with the help
of a massive vibro hammer tool,

20:30.080 --> 20:33.610
the team can conduct
today's dye test

20:33.610 --> 20:35.679
without fear
that the Money Pit site

20:35.679 --> 20:36.900
will be further compromised.

20:36.900 --> 20:38.630
Hey, powder man.

20:38.630 --> 20:40.940
That's me, I think.

20:40.940 --> 20:44.400
-This is it?
-That's all it.

20:44.400 --> 20:47.250
-That's why you got to...
-The magic powder?

20:47.250 --> 20:49.010
Magic. I'll tell you what.
One touch of that,

20:49.010 --> 20:50.380
you will turn red as a beet.

20:50.380 --> 20:52.620
All right. Well,
we'll be a little bit careful.

20:52.620 --> 20:53.620
-Here's the thing, Terry.
-Yep.

20:53.620 --> 20:55.380
I think you're a perfect guy
for this.

20:55.380 --> 20:56.580
What you really want to do, too,

20:56.580 --> 20:58.130
you want to put this in
ten minutes

20:58.130 --> 21:00.000
-after the water starts.
-Ten minutes after. Got it.

21:00.000 --> 21:01.000
MARTY:
Remember, this is

21:01.000 --> 21:02.000
a different introduction point.

21:02.000 --> 21:03.830
-Mm-hmm.
-MARTY: If this is more tied

21:03.830 --> 21:05.030
to the flood tunnel,

21:05.030 --> 21:07.080
I would be excited
if it comes out

21:07.080 --> 21:09.050
-in Smith's Cove only.
-TERRY: Absolutely.

21:09.050 --> 21:14.049
Oh, I... Don't even let that
get in the wind, okay?

21:14.049 --> 21:17.120
NARRATOR:
Unlike their previous dye test,

21:17.120 --> 21:18.120
which was conducted

21:18.120 --> 21:20.179
in Borehole 10-X
four years ago,

21:20.179 --> 21:24.410
the Oak Island team has decided
to base today's operation

21:24.410 --> 21:27.370
inside Borehole C-1.

21:27.370 --> 21:28.380
This was the place

21:28.380 --> 21:31.040
originally chosen
by Charles Barkhouse

21:31.040 --> 21:32.900
and where he and Rick Lagina

21:32.900 --> 21:36.750
found evidence of both
an enormous underground void...

21:36.750 --> 21:41.250
...and also a glittering,
gold-colored object.

21:41.250 --> 21:44.630
-What the hell is that?
-RICK: It's your gold color.

21:44.630 --> 21:46.830
CHARLES:
Yeah, there it is, David.

21:46.830 --> 21:49.150
We've chosen C-1 because

21:49.150 --> 21:52.870
we know C-1 has salt water
in it, which is good.

21:52.870 --> 21:53.870
Means it's connected

21:53.870 --> 21:55.380
to the complex hydrology

21:55.380 --> 21:56.840
that exists
at the Money Pit area.

21:56.840 --> 21:59.222
So that's where
we're gonna put the dye in.

21:59.222 --> 22:01.080
NARRATOR:
Using a six-inch pump,

22:01.080 --> 22:04.220
the team will force
600 gallons of water per minute

22:04.220 --> 22:06.350
down the C-1 shaft.

22:06.350 --> 22:09.160
Once a consistent water flow
has been established,

22:09.160 --> 22:13.250
the team will start adding
a nontoxic, red-colored dye

22:13.250 --> 22:16.520
which, if the test is
successful, will make its way

22:16.520 --> 22:19.021
through any existing
underground flood tunnels

22:19.021 --> 22:20.870
and out into the ocean.

22:20.870 --> 22:21.870
Gentlemen.

22:21.870 --> 22:24.549
-JACK: Hey, Marty. Hey, Rick.
-Hey, guys.

22:24.549 --> 22:26.850
-JACK: Good morning.
-Good morning.

22:26.850 --> 22:28.990
Well, things are happening.
This is exciting.

22:28.990 --> 22:31.400
I'm actually amazingly excited
about this.

22:31.400 --> 22:32.500
Yeah, I'm excited.
I think it's gonna

22:32.500 --> 22:33.920
actually work this time, though.

22:33.920 --> 22:34.920
MARTY:
Good. Guys, look, we're gonna

22:34.920 --> 22:36.460
get everybody lined out here
real quick.

22:36.460 --> 22:38.150
The drone guys will be here
in a minute.

22:38.150 --> 22:39.600
We got this.
We got this covered.

22:39.600 --> 22:41.200
You're in the boat.
Charles, why don't you

22:41.200 --> 22:42.200
-go with him?
-Okay.

22:42.200 --> 22:43.840
Gary, why don't you be
Smith's Cove guy?

22:43.840 --> 22:45.530
-Okay.
-See if that red dye comes out

22:45.530 --> 22:46.530
and where.

22:46.530 --> 22:47.530
Rick and I
will be on the monitors

22:47.530 --> 22:48.809
-with you, Jack.
-Okay.

22:48.809 --> 22:51.900
So, I think, everybody,
we're ready to begin.

22:51.900 --> 22:54.220
NARRATOR:
Because Rick and Marty

22:54.220 --> 22:57.070
don't know when
or where the dye might appear,

22:57.070 --> 23:00.640
they have arranged an extensive
monitoring operation

23:00.640 --> 23:02.240
across both the eastern

23:02.240 --> 23:04.380
and the southern areas
of the island.

23:04.380 --> 23:06.340
In addition
to having team members

23:06.340 --> 23:08.760
stationed on land
at Smith's Cove

23:08.760 --> 23:11.750
and in boats just off
the island's southern shore...

23:11.750 --> 23:13.730
TONY:
May everything we see be red.

23:13.730 --> 23:16.490
...there will also be
three drones

23:16.490 --> 23:19.390
equipped with
high-definition video cameras

23:19.390 --> 23:21.559
scouring the waters
from high above.

23:21.559 --> 23:25.090
They have also set up
a remote viewing area

23:25.090 --> 23:27.220
allowing them
to see the live feeds

23:27.220 --> 23:29.230
from each drone camera.

23:29.230 --> 23:31.750
Hey, Bill.

23:31.750 --> 23:34.380
We're ready up top if you are.

23:34.380 --> 23:35.630
Yeah.

23:35.630 --> 23:37.320
You all right?

23:37.320 --> 23:39.070
You're gonna leave
your drain open?

23:39.070 --> 23:42.910
We're ready to...
ready to start.

23:42.910 --> 23:45.470
RICK:
Start it up.

23:45.470 --> 23:46.470
Okay.

23:46.470 --> 23:48.670
Here comes the water.

23:48.670 --> 23:51.870
Oh, (bleep). Look at that.

23:51.870 --> 23:52.870
Whoa!

23:52.870 --> 23:55.080
Kill it! Kill it!

23:55.080 --> 23:58.920
-TERRY: Cut! Cut!
-MARTY: Kill it!

23:58.920 --> 24:02.120
Kill it! Kill the pump!

24:02.120 --> 24:03.400
Kill it!

24:03.400 --> 24:05.960
MARTY:
Kill the pump!

24:05.960 --> 24:09.160
Kill it! Kill the pump!

24:09.160 --> 24:14.290
-(walkie-talkie beeps)
-Kill the pump. Kill the pump.

24:14.290 --> 24:16.169
NARRATOR:
It is a tense moment

24:16.169 --> 24:18.030
on Oak Island.

24:18.030 --> 24:20.169
Just as Rick,
Marty and the team

24:20.169 --> 24:22.820
began pumping water
down Borehole C-1

24:22.820 --> 24:25.430
to begin
a large-scale dye test,

24:25.430 --> 24:28.440
the six-inch-wide hose
has suddenly become twisted.

24:28.440 --> 24:32.370
If not covered,
it could explode with the force

24:32.370 --> 24:35.200
of 1,500 pounds
per square inch.

24:35.200 --> 24:36.830
What the hell?

24:36.830 --> 24:38.860
We got 40 twists in it.

24:38.860 --> 24:40.920
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait.

24:40.920 --> 24:43.530
Let that dissipate a little.

24:43.530 --> 24:44.530
Because that's gonna...

24:44.530 --> 24:45.650
As soon as you take that off,
it's gonna twist.

24:45.650 --> 24:47.030
Go down and break it down there

24:47.030 --> 24:50.120
-so we can drain it off.
-Yeah, I know. I'll let that...

24:50.120 --> 24:51.670
-I'll let
that little valve open.

24:51.670 --> 24:52.670
-Okay.

24:52.670 --> 24:53.670
Yeah, it won't take much

24:53.670 --> 24:57.520
'cause we're at the very
high point here, but...

24:57.520 --> 25:03.860
(chuckling):
...look at that.

25:03.860 --> 25:10.300
All right,
an inauspicious beginning.

25:10.300 --> 25:12.870
I hate to say
typical Oak Island,

25:12.870 --> 25:14.510
but I'm gonna say
typical Oak Island.

25:14.510 --> 25:15.790
RICK:
You should just break it

25:15.790 --> 25:16.790
at the pump

25:16.790 --> 25:18.040
and drain all the water out.

25:18.040 --> 25:19.040
It's the emotional
roller coaster of Oak Island.

25:19.040 --> 25:20.040
You just move forward.

25:20.040 --> 25:21.040
I can't believe
that didn't blow.

25:21.040 --> 25:22.040
RICK:
That looks good.

25:22.040 --> 25:23.040
TERRY:
Ready to start.

25:23.040 --> 25:24.040
(machine whirring)

25:24.040 --> 25:26.380
There's the hot air.

25:26.380 --> 25:39.620
NARRATOR: Now that the hose
has been straightened

25:39.620 --> 25:42.220
and a steady flow of water
has been established in C-1,

25:42.220 --> 25:45.970
the Oak Island team
will now begin to introduce

25:45.970 --> 25:48.929
nontoxic red dye
into the shaft.

25:48.929 --> 25:51.980
It is the team's hope
that they will soon see dye

25:51.980 --> 25:54.850
seeping out
from one or more locations

25:54.850 --> 25:56.680
along the island's shoreline.

25:56.680 --> 25:58.809
If they can trace
the dye backwards,

25:58.809 --> 26:02.500
it should theoretically
lead them to the place

26:02.500 --> 26:05.500
that the flood tunnels
were designed to protect:

26:05.500 --> 26:07.220
the Money Pit treasure vault.

26:07.220 --> 26:09.210
MARTY:
Be a little heavy

26:09.210 --> 26:11.990
on the first ones, and then go

26:11.990 --> 26:14.370
with the plan. Thank you. Over.

26:14.370 --> 26:15.560
TERRY:
Roger that.

26:15.560 --> 26:17.750
NARRATOR:
As geologist Terry Matheson

26:17.750 --> 26:20.280
and veteran treasure hunter
Dan Henskee

26:20.280 --> 26:21.390
continue to pour dye

26:21.390 --> 26:22.730
down C-1...

26:22.730 --> 26:24.970
TERRY:
Look at that.

26:24.970 --> 26:26.770
Drones in the air, please.
Let's go.

26:26.770 --> 26:28.110
We're gonna release this.

26:28.110 --> 26:30.730
...Rick and Marty will monitor

26:30.730 --> 26:32.230
the live video feeds

26:32.230 --> 26:34.120
of three aerial drone cameras

26:34.120 --> 26:37.010
that are hovering above
the eastern part of the island.

26:37.010 --> 26:39.460
JACK:
How long do you think, Marty,

26:39.460 --> 26:41.700
until we see
the first little bit of dye?

26:41.700 --> 26:42.700
MARTY:
Uh, you know,

26:42.700 --> 26:44.240
despite my healthy skepticism,

26:44.240 --> 26:46.010
if there really is
a flood tunnel,

26:46.010 --> 26:47.790
and if it's really packed
with rocks

26:47.790 --> 26:49.820
and it's really
about the size they said,

26:49.820 --> 26:55.520
it should show up over here
in about half an hour.

26:55.520 --> 26:58.010
NARRATOR:
Meanwhile, in the waters

26:58.010 --> 27:00.429
just off the island's
southern shore,

27:00.429 --> 27:03.600
Charles Barkhouse
and diver Tony Sampson

27:03.600 --> 27:05.320
are searching by boat.

27:05.320 --> 27:07.910
If they see any dye
in the water,

27:07.910 --> 27:11.350
they will pinpoint the source
with GPS coordinates.

27:11.350 --> 27:14.360
It is quite remarkable
how technology has changed

27:14.360 --> 27:17.380
in the sort of ten years
we've been at this.

27:17.380 --> 27:19.630
Other times when we wanted
to look at the island

27:19.630 --> 27:21.820
from the air,
we had to rent a helicopter.

27:21.820 --> 27:23.970
Now we're gonna have three
or four eyes

27:23.970 --> 27:25.250
in the air all the time.

27:25.250 --> 27:29.419
It's gonna be
a very well-covered observation

27:29.419 --> 27:31.080
to see where that dye comes out.

27:31.080 --> 27:35.340
(over walkie-talkie):
The dye has been cast.

27:35.340 --> 27:37.480
CHARLES:
Copy that.

27:37.480 --> 27:41.059
We'll be expecting South Cove

27:41.059 --> 27:43.720
to turn red at some point.

27:43.720 --> 27:44.720
Hey, Rick.

27:44.720 --> 27:45.780
Still going in?

27:45.780 --> 27:47.430
TERRY:
Yeah. Very constant,

27:47.430 --> 27:48.430
very steady.

27:48.430 --> 27:51.070
We're loading
this charge point here.

27:51.070 --> 27:52.940
There's...
We've got to have plug flow

27:52.940 --> 27:56.330
all the way down this caisson
and then out into...

27:56.330 --> 27:58.100
We know there's a tunnel
down there,

27:58.100 --> 28:00.420
and it's got to come out
some way.

28:00.420 --> 28:03.280
We just keep eyes on it.

28:03.280 --> 28:09.559
Got to happen, Rick.

28:09.559 --> 28:17.400
JACK:
Now, what is that?

28:17.400 --> 28:18.520
There's something there.

28:18.520 --> 28:22.100
(over walkie-talkie):
Hey, Tony. Are you there? Over.

28:22.100 --> 28:23.440
Tony receive. Over.

28:23.440 --> 28:25.679
JACK:
Can you go over

28:25.679 --> 28:28.330
to, uh, where
the bald spot's at?

28:28.330 --> 28:30.540
There's some weird anomaly
in the water

28:30.540 --> 28:31.900
I'd like you to look at.

28:31.900 --> 28:35.600
Copy that.
Uh, heading that way now.

28:35.600 --> 28:37.720
Tony, this is Jack.

28:37.720 --> 28:40.710
Do you have eyes on the drone?

28:40.710 --> 28:42.809
TONY:
There's the drone

28:42.809 --> 28:43.850
right off the bow, Charles.

28:43.850 --> 28:46.480
Oh, I see it. Yeah.

28:46.480 --> 28:48.780
You guys see anything?

28:48.780 --> 28:49.980
CHARLES:
I don't see anything.

28:49.980 --> 28:51.669
TONY (over walkie-talkie):
Affirmative, Jack.

28:51.669 --> 28:54.890
We're right underneath it.
We don't see any discoloration

28:54.890 --> 28:56.640
in the water. Over.

28:56.640 --> 28:57.970
JACK:
Okay.

28:57.970 --> 28:59.590
Thanks for checking, Tony.

28:59.590 --> 29:01.730
NARRATOR:
As the team waits

29:01.730 --> 29:02.790
with anticipation

29:02.790 --> 29:04.930
for signs of the dye to appear,

29:04.930 --> 29:07.070
they receive a surprise visit

29:07.070 --> 29:09.410
from Rick,
Marty and Craig's partner,

29:09.410 --> 29:10.410
Dan Blankenship.

29:10.410 --> 29:12.070
Well, look who's here.

29:12.070 --> 29:14.680
-Daniel.
-What do you say, Marty?

29:14.680 --> 29:15.760
Been a while.

29:15.760 --> 29:18.160
-(chuckles)
-How are you, partner?

29:18.160 --> 29:21.880
-Can't stay away.
-Yeah, you can't stay away.

29:21.880 --> 29:24.890
Back to your old
stomping grounds.

29:24.890 --> 29:28.270
NARRATOR:
At the age of 95,

29:28.270 --> 29:30.990
Dan Blankenship has spent
the last five decades

29:30.990 --> 29:33.260
working to solve

29:33.260 --> 29:36.250
the 223-year-old
Oak Island mystery.

29:36.250 --> 29:39.309
It is from Dan
that Rick, Marty and Craig

29:39.309 --> 29:42.120
have learned much
of what they know now

29:42.120 --> 29:44.050
not only about the history
of the island,

29:44.050 --> 29:46.580
but where searches
have been conducted

29:46.580 --> 29:51.000
and what search methods
have proved successful.

29:51.000 --> 29:54.419
In 1988, Dan and his son Dave

29:54.419 --> 29:55.850
conducted a dye test

29:55.850 --> 29:58.750
similar to the one
being attempted today.

29:58.750 --> 30:01.400
Using Borehole 10-X,

30:01.400 --> 30:04.700
the 235-foot-deep shaft
Dan dug by hand,

30:04.700 --> 30:08.620
the veteran treasure hunter
noticed red dye seeping out

30:08.620 --> 30:11.809
not only at Smith's Cove
but also in the waters

30:11.809 --> 30:15.470
just off the island's
northern and southern shores.

30:15.470 --> 30:19.590
Unfortunately, Dan lacked
the financial resources

30:19.590 --> 30:24.220
that would have enabled him
to follow up on his findings.

30:24.220 --> 30:26.179
Nice to see you, Dan.

30:26.179 --> 30:27.179
How's everything going? Good?

30:27.179 --> 30:30.600
-Oh, yeah. Yeah.
-Yeah. What do you think?

30:30.600 --> 30:33.460
We made quite a mess,

30:33.460 --> 30:35.169
didn't we?
(chuckles)

30:35.169 --> 30:36.309
Your words.

30:36.309 --> 30:38.300
(chuckles): Yeah.
They're my words.

30:38.300 --> 30:39.590
-You're right.
-(laughs)

30:39.590 --> 30:41.309
Well, we got-- we got dye

30:41.309 --> 30:44.049
-going in again, you know.
-Yeah.

30:44.049 --> 30:46.830
When you did it, where did it
come out? You remember?

30:46.830 --> 30:49.440
Came out right here
to the left-hand side

30:49.440 --> 30:50.980
of-of your... what-you-call-it,

30:50.980 --> 30:53.150
and it came out
on the south shore.

30:53.150 --> 30:56.230
How long did it take?
Do you rember that?

30:56.230 --> 30:59.130
Depending upon how long
you were pumping.

30:59.130 --> 31:01.390
On the average,
I would guess

31:01.390 --> 31:02.630
about three-three, four days.

31:02.630 --> 31:04.330
Three, four days?

31:04.330 --> 31:07.720
Depending upon h-how many
gallons a minute you're pumping.

31:07.720 --> 31:08.720
600.

31:08.720 --> 31:10.580
-That's a lot.
-You know,

31:10.580 --> 31:12.370
this is all sealed off,
so-- I don't know--

31:12.370 --> 31:14.690
that might change the dynamic.

31:14.690 --> 31:16.850
Maybe. You want to come
over here and see the monitors?

31:16.850 --> 31:17.960
-Yeah, sure.
-Okay.

31:17.960 --> 31:19.330
MARTY:
It's always a pleasure

31:19.330 --> 31:20.380
when Dan comes out.

31:20.380 --> 31:23.480
I mean,
he's still amazingly fit.

31:23.480 --> 31:26.289
He's 95 years old, and-and

31:26.289 --> 31:28.650
it's apparent
that that's significant.

31:28.650 --> 31:31.480
We're all sort of getting
keenly aware of Father Time.

31:31.480 --> 31:34.330
And, yeah, it's time.
It's time to-to solve this,

31:34.330 --> 31:35.950
for him and for us.

31:35.950 --> 31:38.159
We got three drones up, Dan.

31:38.159 --> 31:39.159
They're live.

31:39.159 --> 31:42.470
Marty to Tony.
Do you read me?

31:42.470 --> 31:43.909
Tony, receive. Over.

31:43.909 --> 31:45.820
Just checking in, Tony.

31:45.820 --> 31:48.700
Have you guys spotted
anything yet?

31:48.700 --> 31:49.700
Negative, Marty.

31:49.700 --> 31:53.130
Nothing on the southern side.
Over.

31:53.130 --> 31:56.520
MARTY: Okay, Tony, thanks.
Why don't you head back

31:56.520 --> 31:58.130
over to, uh, the other side

31:58.130 --> 31:59.130
off the swamp.

31:59.130 --> 32:01.520
TONY:
Going over to the swamp area.

32:01.520 --> 32:02.520
Copy, Marty. Over.

32:02.520 --> 32:03.520
MARTY:
Thank you, Tony. Over.

32:03.520 --> 32:04.520
JACK:
Still have eyes

32:04.520 --> 32:06.320
on the south shore beach,

32:06.320 --> 32:12.230
but we haven't seen

32:12.230 --> 32:18.140
any dye yet. Over.

32:18.140 --> 32:22.570
Oh, my God.

32:22.570 --> 32:27.000
Look at that.

32:27.000 --> 32:29.950
Holy schmoly.

32:29.950 --> 32:43.250
Rick, uh, this is Gary.
Can you come down

32:43.250 --> 32:45.640
into the basin?

32:45.640 --> 32:51.630
I've got something interesting
to show you.

32:51.630 --> 32:53.340
Say again?

32:53.340 --> 32:57.610
GARY:
Why don't everybody come?

32:57.610 --> 32:59.320
It's interesting.

32:59.320 --> 33:02.360
If we're looking for red, guys,

33:02.360 --> 33:04.490
I'd say
that's reddy-brown there.

33:04.490 --> 33:07.080
-JACK: Oh, what?
-NARRATOR: While conducting

33:07.080 --> 33:10.000
a dye test
at the Money Pit site in search

33:10.000 --> 33:13.290
of the source
of the legendary flood tunnels,

33:13.290 --> 33:15.919
treasure hunter Gary Drayton
has just found

33:15.919 --> 33:19.049
where dye may be seeping out
at Smith's Cove.

33:19.049 --> 33:21.409
GARY:
And this is all new.

33:21.409 --> 33:24.770
It's-it's all started
flowing out since this morning.

33:24.770 --> 33:27.240
-This was all dry before.
-JACK: Oh, this is what

33:27.240 --> 33:28.710
-what we're looking for.
Great job, Gary.

33:28.710 --> 33:29.710
-Yeah.

33:29.710 --> 33:30.799
Yeah, okay, I don't want to be

33:30.799 --> 33:34.030
the dog in the manger,
but I will.

33:34.030 --> 33:36.730
I think
that's just rust-colored, Gary.

33:36.730 --> 33:39.960
MARTY:
Honestly, I-I didn't think

33:39.960 --> 33:41.110
the dye test would work.

33:41.110 --> 33:43.140
And I have my doubts, but...

33:43.140 --> 33:46.130
it's hard
not to get enthusiastic

33:46.130 --> 33:48.470
in spite of all the setbacks
on this island.

33:48.470 --> 33:50.590
So I'm hoping
the rust color means something.

33:50.590 --> 33:51.820
GARY:
If a dye goes through

33:51.820 --> 33:53.210
a certain matrix

33:53.210 --> 33:54.640
and a certain material,

33:54.640 --> 33:57.010
is it possible if it would go,
like, a reddy-brown?

33:57.010 --> 33:59.880
Right. It kind of gets filtered
out to that color.

33:59.880 --> 34:01.510
-It's certainly
pretty interesting.

34:01.510 --> 34:02.510
-GARY: Yep.

34:02.510 --> 34:04.809
Look at-- look at that.
There's the stuff

34:04.809 --> 34:06.000
coming out from shoreward.

34:06.000 --> 34:11.270
Is it shoreward or is it
running from that same...

34:11.270 --> 34:13.210
-source, that same stream?
-It's coming--

34:13.210 --> 34:14.210
-It's coming from yours.
-Oh, right.

34:14.210 --> 34:15.210
-That's what I'm trying to say.

34:15.210 --> 34:16.210
-GARY: Okay, yeah.
-That's what I'm trying to say.

34:16.210 --> 34:17.210
That's coming

34:17.210 --> 34:19.129
-from up-upland.
-Yeah.

34:19.129 --> 34:21.998
NARRATOR:
Although a sudden flow of water

34:21.998 --> 34:23.949
is evidence
of a possible connection

34:23.949 --> 34:26.869
between Smith's Cove
and the Money Pit,

34:26.869 --> 34:30.219
until the team can confirm
that dye is coming out here,

34:30.219 --> 34:32.079
they cannot be sure.

34:32.079 --> 34:35.159
We've been checking this area
out, Rick.

34:35.159 --> 34:36.399
I've never seen it

34:36.399 --> 34:38.260
-that vid orange before.
-RICK: No.

34:38.260 --> 34:41.330
GARY: And I also noticed the
flow of the water's increased.

34:41.330 --> 34:43.119
It seems to be getting faster.

34:43.119 --> 34:47.018
So it's flowing faster, and it's
definitely getting more orange.

34:47.018 --> 34:49.429
MARTY: Bleeding out
right by the crane pad.

34:49.429 --> 34:50.549
LAIRD:
Yeah.

34:50.549 --> 34:53.109
So, they'll want to test
a little bit of this.

34:53.109 --> 34:56.159
I mean, it really, really is
a good deep color.

34:56.159 --> 34:58.920
-Yes, that wouldn't hurt.
-Look at it.

34:58.920 --> 35:00.430
Gary, I'm prepared to be wrong.

35:00.430 --> 35:02.039
JACK:
Here. Here, I'll...

35:02.039 --> 35:03.730
I'll recover a sample.

35:03.730 --> 35:05.799
You want me to just go up
this thing?

35:05.799 --> 35:07.619
GARY:
Yeah, there is some red there

35:07.619 --> 35:09.380
on the left-hand side.

35:09.380 --> 35:10.420
Now.

35:10.420 --> 35:14.109
In order to confirm
the presence of dye,

35:14.109 --> 35:16.700
the team is collecting
water samples

35:16.700 --> 35:19.019
to test
for the nontoxic chemical.

35:19.019 --> 35:21.969
GARY:
So we got two samples to test

35:21.969 --> 35:27.509
and-and see if that is the dye
that's making that color.

35:27.509 --> 35:34.710
-Yeah.
-Okay. Let's do it.

35:34.710 --> 35:37.589
(thunder rumbling)

35:37.589 --> 35:40.369
NARRATOR:
As a sudden rainstorm

35:40.369 --> 35:42.229
threatens to wash away
all evidence

35:42.229 --> 35:44.499
gained
by this morning's dye test...

35:44.499 --> 35:46.930
-Hey, Jack.
-I brought the water samples

35:46.930 --> 35:48.730
-from the dye test.
-Okay, perfect.

35:48.730 --> 35:52.109
...Jack Begley joins
island historian Paul Troutman

35:52.109 --> 35:54.609
at the Oak Island
Research Center to test

35:54.609 --> 35:58.859
water samples that were
collected at Smith's Cove.

35:58.859 --> 36:00.950
Did you just put

36:00.950 --> 36:02.630
some of the dye we actually used

36:02.630 --> 36:04.249
-into the vial?
-Yes, I put some

36:04.249 --> 36:06.079
of the-the dye into the vial.

36:06.079 --> 36:07.670
That's our primary sample.
I'll also need

36:07.670 --> 36:09.039
to prepare a blank sample

36:09.039 --> 36:11.670
with this electrically neutral
water.

36:11.670 --> 36:13.660
So that we'll know
what it looks like with

36:13.660 --> 36:16.349
high concentrations of dye
and then also without

36:16.349 --> 36:19.920
-any dye in it.
-Mm-hmm. Correct.

36:19.920 --> 36:22.140
Using a device known
as a fluorometer,

36:22.140 --> 36:25.740
Jack and Paul will be able
to detect any traces

36:25.740 --> 36:29.960
of the nontoxic red dye
in concentrations as small

36:29.960 --> 36:31.769
as one part per trillion.

36:31.769 --> 36:33.349
PAUL:
Now I'm just gonna get

36:33.349 --> 36:36.729
a base reading
to see what the sample reads as.

36:36.729 --> 36:40.140
We're getting 9.689.

36:40.140 --> 36:43.769
PAUL:
That'll be our base reference

36:43.769 --> 36:45.059
for fully saturated.

36:45.059 --> 36:46.979
-All right.
-About 9.7.

36:46.979 --> 36:48.579
Yeah,
anything that's one or above

36:48.579 --> 36:51.760
would be a positive indicator
of the actual dye.

36:51.760 --> 36:54.050
Okay, so now that we have
those two,

36:54.050 --> 36:57.660
what we're gonna do is go ahead
and pour the first sample in.

36:57.660 --> 37:00.089
This is Smith's Cove 1,

37:00.089 --> 37:02.210
for the stream
that was leaching out

37:02.210 --> 37:06.160
-by the crane pad.
-Okay. Gotcha.

37:06.160 --> 37:07.160
Um...

37:07.160 --> 37:09.579
PAUL:
That's good enough.

37:09.579 --> 37:14.420
Okay, we're gonna read
the sample here right now.

37:14.420 --> 37:17.539
Come on.

37:17.539 --> 37:25.749
Let's see what we got.

37:25.749 --> 37:30.769
: Okay, we're gonna read
the sample here right now.

37:30.769 --> 37:32.349
Come on.

37:32.349 --> 37:35.989
NARRATOR: After gathering
water samples at Smith's Cove,

37:35.989 --> 37:39.369
Jack Begley and Oak Island
researcher Paul Troutman

37:39.369 --> 37:42.099
are conducting
a fluorometer test

37:42.099 --> 37:46.079
in hopes of finding traces
of red dye.

37:46.079 --> 37:48.229
If they get a reading
above a one,

37:48.229 --> 37:50.739
they will have proven
the possible existence

37:50.739 --> 37:53.039
of a flood tunnel
directly linking

37:53.039 --> 37:55.329
the Money Pit to Smith's Cove.

37:55.329 --> 38:02.619
JACK:
Let's see what we got.

38:02.619 --> 38:04.680
-Yeah!
-That's a good

38:04.680 --> 38:05.740
positive indication.

38:05.740 --> 38:07.739
JACK:
That's awesome.

38:07.739 --> 38:10.630
Since we've been successful
so far, I'm gonna call Rick.

38:10.630 --> 38:12.650
-He's gonna want to hear
the good news.

38:12.650 --> 38:14.480
-Yeah, he will.

38:14.480 --> 38:15.700
(line ringing)

38:15.700 --> 38:18.140
-Hello?
-JACK: Hey, Rick.

38:18.140 --> 38:20.630
Paul and I are testing
the water samples right now

38:20.630 --> 38:23.049
that we collected
during the dye test,

38:23.049 --> 38:27.589
and we got some results we think
that you should come see.

38:27.589 --> 38:29.390
PAUL:
Okay.

38:29.390 --> 38:32.979
See you, Rick. Bye.

38:32.979 --> 38:34.660
The positive dye test results

38:34.660 --> 38:36.970
means that there was
a really strong connection

38:36.970 --> 38:40.109
between Smith's Cove
and the Money Pit.

38:40.109 --> 38:42.609
It's just amazing information,
and it's

38:42.609 --> 38:45.450
a huge breakthrough
for our team this year.

38:45.450 --> 38:48.079
-Hey, Rick.
-Hey, Rick.

38:48.079 --> 38:51.359
Okay, I see Jack smiling.

38:51.359 --> 38:53.799
-I see Paul smiling.
-(chuckling)

38:53.799 --> 38:54.799
Doug.

38:54.799 --> 38:56.440
-It's interesting.
-It's interesting?

38:56.440 --> 38:58.980
-PAUL: Yeah.
-JACK: From the samples

38:58.980 --> 39:02.059
that we obtained,
so far, the Smith's Cove

39:02.059 --> 39:04.670
dye tests that we got...

39:04.670 --> 39:05.670
Mm-hmm.

39:05.670 --> 39:07.040
...it tested positive.

39:07.040 --> 39:08.140
-Smith's Cove?
-Yeah.

39:08.140 --> 39:09.329
-PAUL: Smith's Cove.

39:09.329 --> 39:11.779
Yeah, right underneath
the crane pad,

39:11.779 --> 39:12.859
where the water was coming out.

39:12.859 --> 39:14.049
-Oh, really? Right there?
-JACK: Mm-hmm.

39:14.049 --> 39:15.049
-Yeah.

39:15.049 --> 39:16.509
-Right at that spot.
-You know what, Gary said

39:16.509 --> 39:18.249
-that water changed color.
-Mm-hmm.

39:18.249 --> 39:19.640
So that's a positive indication

39:19.640 --> 39:22.180
that he was actually right,
from what he saw.

39:22.180 --> 39:24.990
Exactly. Exactly.
My brother said--

39:24.990 --> 39:28.690
and I concur--
that, out in the ocean,

39:28.690 --> 39:30.539
it's still interesting.

39:30.539 --> 39:31.950
But in Smith's Cove,

39:31.950 --> 39:33.750
that's
a totally different ball game.

39:33.750 --> 39:34.920
RICK:
This could be part

39:34.920 --> 39:37.490
of a flood tunnel connection
to the Money Pit.

39:37.490 --> 39:39.910
There's so much we don't know
about the Money Pit

39:39.910 --> 39:41.329
and the work
that the searchers did.

39:41.329 --> 39:43.710
We don't even know
what the original peoples did,

39:43.710 --> 39:46.670
the original depositional work
that was done.

39:46.670 --> 39:48.960
We could retest this
while you're here so you can see

39:48.960 --> 39:51.930
-for yourself.
-Go for it.

39:51.930 --> 39:55.369
I think we're closer than ever
to unraveling

39:55.369 --> 39:56.369
the Money Pit.

39:56.369 --> 39:57.369
JACK:
Yeah!

39:57.369 --> 39:58.890
-It's even higher!
-PAUL: Yeah. Yeah.

39:58.890 --> 40:00.680
JACK:
That means, even though

40:00.680 --> 40:03.700
-we can't see the dye in here,
it's definitely

40:03.700 --> 40:04.700
-Yeah,

40:04.700 --> 40:05.700
-in the water.
-there-there's some--

40:05.700 --> 40:06.700
there's some concentration

40:06.700 --> 40:07.700
that it's detecting.

40:07.700 --> 40:08.700
-It's exciting.
-It's exciting, yes.

40:08.700 --> 40:09.700
JACK:
'Cause if there wasn't

40:09.700 --> 40:10.700
a flood tunnel,

40:10.700 --> 40:11.700
I can't think
of any other way that

40:11.700 --> 40:13.829
this dye would have made it
to Smith's Cove.

40:13.829 --> 40:14.839
Exactly. Exactly.

40:14.839 --> 40:18.989
You know, I fall back
on what Fred told me long ago:

40:18.989 --> 40:21.339
duplication, duplication,
duplication.

40:21.339 --> 40:23.450
Retest, remeasure, reaffirm

40:23.450 --> 40:24.989
that the data is accurate.

40:24.989 --> 40:27.209
And what it says is,

40:27.209 --> 40:28.739
all the more reason to dig under

40:28.739 --> 40:30.920
the crane pad
and try to follow this back.

40:30.920 --> 40:32.720
We'd be foolish
not to follow up.

40:32.720 --> 40:34.760
-PAUL: Yes.
-MARTY: There's a trail

40:34.760 --> 40:35.760
to follow.

40:35.760 --> 40:36.880
And if this leads us to it,

40:36.880 --> 40:38.789
it would be
a big eye-opener for me.

40:38.789 --> 40:41.170
It's significant.
It's very, very significant.

40:41.170 --> 40:43.900
Great job.
The dye showing up

40:43.900 --> 40:45.130
in Smith's Cove is-is...

40:45.130 --> 40:47.900
I mean, I don't--
I don't know what to--

40:47.900 --> 40:50.030
what to say,
other than it's great news.

40:50.030 --> 40:51.230
-Okay.
-Mm-hmm.

40:51.230 --> 40:54.240
RICK:
All right. Thanks, guys.

40:54.240 --> 40:55.779
NARRATOR:
For the Laginas

40:55.779 --> 40:56.809
and their partners,

40:56.809 --> 41:01.469
a week that began with a major
setback in the Money Pit area

41:01.469 --> 41:04.319
has ended with one of
their greatest breakthroughs.

41:04.319 --> 41:07.489
They may have proven once
and for all

41:07.489 --> 41:09.140
that the legends and stories

41:09.140 --> 41:12.730
about a network of man-made
flood tunnels are true.

41:12.730 --> 41:16.299
But if the team
has finally found a direct path

41:16.299 --> 41:18.420
to the Money Pit
treasure vault,

41:18.420 --> 41:20.680
what will they find there?

41:20.680 --> 41:22.499
Something of incredible value?

41:22.499 --> 41:26.269
Or will they learn that,
with each new discovery,

41:26.269 --> 41:36.119
they are only getting closer
and closer to a deadly trap?

41:36.119 --> 41:37.930
Next time
on The Curse of Oak Island...

41:37.930 --> 41:39.480
28 feet of water, lads!

41:39.480 --> 41:40.730
ALEX:
These are targets

41:40.730 --> 41:41.730
that we've identified.

41:41.730 --> 41:43.520
MARTY:
I don't think that's a rock.

41:43.520 --> 41:44.589
What is this?

41:44.589 --> 41:46.010
RICK:
There it is!

41:46.010 --> 41:47.010
Finally, we've exposed

41:47.010 --> 41:49.049
the entire slipway structure.

41:49.049 --> 41:50.063
It's the biggest mystery,
isn't it?

41:50.063 --> 41:51.063
They want to keep things secret.

41:51.063 --> 41:53.200
Ooh! Look at that!
That looks like

41:53.200 --> 41:55.789
it's off
a substantial treasure chest.

41:55.789 --> 41:57.829
-MARTY: Hello!
-We're gonna find out

41:57.829 --> 41:59.920
from a blacksmith
how old the hinge is.

41:59.920 --> 42:01.940
That is early 1600s.

42:01.940 --> 42:02.940
This could be pre-Money Pit.
