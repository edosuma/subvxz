00:06.214 --> 00:09.983
[Breathing heavily]

00:15.942 --> 00:18.410
It's too hot! I can't!

00:19.096 --> 00:21.898
I'll just take the blast.

00:26.886 --> 00:29.722
Okay, I got a Dora the
Explorer backpack.

00:29.823 --> 00:30.856
No, strike that.

00:30.957 --> 00:33.792
The eyes are too small,
and the haircut's wrong.

00:33.893 --> 00:36.695
Laura the Adventurer.

00:36.796 --> 00:39.732
It's a knock-off!

00:44.558 --> 00:46.058
I got movement!

Freeze. Put your hands on your head.

01:08.962 --> 01:11.063
Oh, right.

01:11.164 --> 01:12.798
Guys, do you mind?

01:12.899 --> 01:15.334
[All grumbling]

01:16.469 --> 01:19.238
Okay, go ahead.

â™ª

01:26.880 --> 01:29.348
â™ª Angie Tribeca

01:31.484 --> 01:33.418
You're shining that right in my eye.

01:33.520 --> 01:34.586
How is she doing?

01:34.687 --> 01:36.522
Post-traumatic stress, hypothermia,

01:36.623 --> 01:38.190
possible case of the Mondays.

01:38.291 --> 01:40.759
I'm just glad I had extra
workout clothes in my locker.

01:40.843 --> 01:41.890
Ma'am, what's your name?

01:41.968 --> 01:43.204
I don't remember.

01:43.305 --> 01:45.874
Do you have any idea who could
have put you in that backpack?

01:45.899 --> 01:46.827
No.

01:46.852 --> 01:48.186
Name all three Bee Gees.

01:48.212 --> 01:50.013
Barry, Robin, and...

01:50.863 --> 01:51.936
and...

01:52.238 --> 01:53.772
It's like her mind's been erased.

01:53.873 --> 01:55.808
This is a textbook case of amnesia.

01:55.909 --> 01:57.509
You can see here on the back of her head

01:57.534 --> 01:58.868
where someone hit her with a textbook.

01:59.045 --> 02:00.312
Ma'am, I'm gonna say some key words

02:00.413 --> 02:01.513
to try and jog your memory.

02:01.614 --> 02:03.649
Let me know if anything sounds familiar.

02:03.750 --> 02:04.817
Ceviche.

02:04.918 --> 02:06.118
Galapagos.

02:06.219 --> 02:07.853
Almond butter.

02:08.297 --> 02:09.430
Saddle bags.

02:09.519 --> 02:10.931
Lupita Nyong'o.

02:10.957 --> 02:12.124
This is hopeless.

02:12.225 --> 02:13.625
Let's just put her in the
asylum and be done with it.

02:13.726 --> 02:15.093
Asylum.

02:15.195 --> 02:17.896
The... The... The lunatics
are taking over the asylum.

02:17.997 --> 02:19.698
Oh, good, she knows who she is.

02:19.799 --> 02:22.301
You're free to go, ma'am.
Have a nice day.

02:22.402 --> 02:23.936
Good job, Geils.

02:24.419 --> 02:25.519
Wait.

02:25.628 --> 02:27.358
Where'd you get that tattoo?

02:27.383 --> 02:28.783
I have a tattoo?

02:28.808 --> 02:31.009
It's a walk/don't walk sign.

02:31.406 --> 02:32.473
What? Seriously?

02:32.832 --> 02:34.433
That's terrible.

02:34.620 --> 02:37.822
Do you think they could turn it
into a dolphin or a yin-yang?

02:38.957 --> 02:40.715
Yeah, probably.

02:42.064 --> 02:43.865
Something's wrong here.

02:43.890 --> 02:45.524
No, we were just telling
her it could be changed

02:45.549 --> 02:46.816
into something else so
she wouldn't get upset.

02:46.993 --> 02:48.493
We need to figure out who she is

02:48.595 --> 02:49.862
and who put her in that bag.

02:49.963 --> 02:51.630
Showing up naked in a
backpack is not a crime,

02:51.731 --> 02:52.931
and without crimes to solve,

02:53.032 --> 02:54.766
we're just two people in businesswear.

02:54.868 --> 02:56.735
What are we supposed to do,
drop her off at the bus stop,

02:56.836 --> 02:58.725
where she has to turn
tricks to buy a candy bar?

02:58.912 --> 03:02.574
Guys, you aren't far away
enough where I can't hear you.

03:04.897 --> 03:06.430
Look, it was exciting

03:06.455 --> 03:07.841
when she crawled out of the backpack,

03:07.866 --> 03:09.490
but now she's eating up our whole day.

03:09.668 --> 03:11.168
She's all alone.

03:11.849 --> 03:13.016
Dr. Scholls?

03:13.717 --> 03:15.963
Can you pack her up for me?
I'm gonna take her home.

03:16.027 --> 03:18.795
Let me grab her food and her toy.

03:18.999 --> 03:21.600
â™ª

03:22.695 --> 03:24.496
How you doing?

03:25.352 --> 03:28.421
I'm just glad I had an
extra set of pajamas.

03:28.522 --> 03:30.656
Why are you being so nice to me?

03:30.757 --> 03:34.927
I guess I can relate to someone
who doesn't know who they are.

03:35.080 --> 03:37.215
But we're gonna have to come
up with something to call you.

03:37.240 --> 03:38.993
Oh, I remember my name. It's...

03:39.044 --> 03:40.178
How about Deirdre?

03:40.968 --> 03:42.969
Okay, sure.

03:43.070 --> 03:45.104
Anyway, you know where the towels are,

03:45.205 --> 03:47.106
and help yourself to anything else.

03:47.222 --> 03:48.556
Just try to get some rest.

03:48.642 --> 03:49.614
Thanks.

03:49.639 --> 03:52.073
Good night.

04:01.021 --> 04:03.422
It's a one-bedroom.

04:08.402 --> 04:10.436
[Air rushing]

04:10.764 --> 04:12.598
[Muffled] Night-night.

04:21.678 --> 04:23.373
Are either of you familiar
with the murderer

04:23.398 --> 04:24.584
Edward Stracciatelli?

04:24.788 --> 04:27.023
[Buzzer] Uhh...

04:27.296 --> 04:28.452
Uhh...

04:28.477 --> 04:29.577
[Bell dings] Geils!

04:29.710 --> 04:31.211
He's one of the Stracciatelli brothers.

04:31.236 --> 04:33.608
They ran a pyramid scheme
about five years ago

04:33.633 --> 04:34.827
based around an energy drink

04:34.852 --> 04:37.100
- that promised to make you immortal.
- Oh, yeah!

04:37.125 --> 04:39.626
Didn't one of the brothers rat
out Edward, so he killed him?

04:39.651 --> 04:40.885
Yes, and then the third brother

04:40.910 --> 04:42.506
ratted out Edward for the murder.

04:42.531 --> 04:45.433
In any case, he was in Huggies
Maximum Security Prison

04:45.458 --> 04:47.660
until this morning, when
his cell was found empty

04:47.685 --> 04:48.818
by prison authorities.

04:48.916 --> 04:50.217
I thought nothing gets out of Huggies.

04:50.318 --> 04:53.553
Your job is to catch
him and put him back.

04:53.654 --> 04:56.856
Hopefully by this Saturday
because I'm planning a little...

04:56.958 --> 04:58.658
engagement party for me and Wiedner.

04:58.759 --> 05:00.193
- Wow, lieutenant!
- Oh-ho!

05:00.294 --> 05:02.462
I don't want to make a
big deal out of it.

05:02.487 --> 05:03.752
- It is a big deal!
- That's great!

05:03.855 --> 05:04.949
What are you talking about?!

05:04.974 --> 05:08.977
I said I do not want to
make a big deal of it!

05:12.525 --> 05:13.892
[Door opens]

05:14.275 --> 05:15.275
Thanks for the clothes.

05:15.376 --> 05:16.676
I'm just glad I had an extra suit.

05:16.777 --> 05:19.613
But maybe we could also stop at a store.

05:19.714 --> 05:20.880
You're welcome.

05:20.982 --> 05:23.016
I think I remember what happened.

05:23.117 --> 05:25.805
My parents, they left me at home,

05:25.830 --> 05:28.375
and then these two burglars,
they tried to break in,

05:28.400 --> 05:30.501
but I set all of these elaborate traps.

05:30.526 --> 05:32.627
We watched "Home Alone" last night.

05:34.291 --> 05:36.559
Oh.

05:36.831 --> 05:39.299
Don't worry. You'll figure it out.

05:39.931 --> 05:41.398
How's your head?

05:42.803 --> 05:45.238
Where'd you learn to do that?

05:47.072 --> 05:49.165
I don't know.

05:56.651 --> 05:57.817
What?

05:59.052 --> 06:01.420
Oh!

06:02.255 --> 06:04.423
Ah!

06:04.524 --> 06:07.492
Ah, no knife training. Got it.

06:09.720 --> 06:11.421
We've gone through Edward's
cell top to bottom. one throl

06:11.522 --> 06:14.090
No clue how he escaped.

06:14.191 --> 06:15.492
Great. Okay.

06:15.593 --> 06:18.528
Well, thank you for your help... Guard.

06:18.629 --> 06:21.865
It's pronounced "Gward."

06:23.933 --> 06:26.200
Okay, I'm Edward Stracciatelli.

06:26.225 --> 06:28.727
I'm in my cell, and I'm gonna escape.

06:28.752 --> 06:30.052
How do I do it?

06:30.153 --> 06:34.256
I don't see nothing out of the ordinary.

06:36.426 --> 06:37.993
Geils.

06:42.166 --> 06:44.701
Baloney sandwich. Of course.

06:45.587 --> 06:49.080
Every day, Stracciatelli gets
a baloney sandwich for lunch.

06:49.105 --> 06:51.369
He sustains himself on
the bread and chips

06:51.394 --> 06:53.696
but starts stockpiling the Baloney.

06:53.789 --> 06:57.925
Pretty soon, he'll have enough
Baloney to get down to business.

06:58.026 --> 07:01.262
[Whirring]

07:01.800 --> 07:03.167
Baloney key.

07:04.875 --> 07:08.478
Baloney clothes.

07:08.860 --> 07:09.827
[Engine revs]

07:09.852 --> 07:12.287
And a Baloney ride.

07:12.648 --> 07:15.388
That all makes sense
except for one thing.

07:15.413 --> 07:18.882
What'd he put in the gas tank?
Baloney doesn't burn.

07:23.009 --> 07:24.210
He had help.

07:24.383 --> 07:28.252
This is where we found you.
Anything ring a bell?

07:28.353 --> 07:31.856
I don't know. It's all so foggy.

07:38.697 --> 07:40.434
Where'd you learn to do that?

07:40.459 --> 07:41.661
I don't know.

07:41.862 --> 07:44.564
Hey, you. [Chuckles]

07:45.272 --> 07:47.307
Oh, my gosh. How are you?

07:47.408 --> 07:50.043
Sorry. I have no idea who you are.

07:50.136 --> 07:51.303
Scott. Yeah, remember?

07:51.412 --> 07:52.979
We had a great time, and you told me

07:53.004 --> 07:54.805
you were gonna call me, but
I never heard from you.

07:55.289 --> 07:56.523
Good thing I saw you. You know what?

07:56.548 --> 07:58.127
This time, I'm gonna
get your phone number.

07:58.152 --> 08:01.187
I don't mean to be rude,
but I have amnesia,

08:01.288 --> 08:03.623
so I don't remember anything.

08:03.724 --> 08:04.891
I'm really sorry.

08:04.992 --> 08:07.135
Amnesia? That's what you're going with?

08:07.205 --> 08:09.006
Wow. That's a new one.

08:09.076 --> 08:12.145
What is it about old Scotty
that makes women "get amnesia"

08:12.223 --> 08:13.423
or "move to Colorado"

08:13.714 --> 08:15.782
or "get cast in a Bolivian
Cirque du Soleil"?

08:15.883 --> 08:17.869
Sir, she really does have amnesia.

08:18.004 --> 08:19.805
You know, all I did was like you,

08:19.830 --> 08:21.305
and it wasn't just because you were

08:21.330 --> 08:22.978
the only person that matched
with me on the website.

08:23.003 --> 08:24.170
I liked the real you.

08:24.195 --> 08:26.063
I liked the person I sat
across from at the table

08:26.201 --> 08:27.435
who paid for my dinner.

08:27.623 --> 08:29.357
Good luck with your amnesia.

08:29.630 --> 08:30.897
Now, if you'll excuse me,

08:30.998 --> 08:33.299
I have to go get my
model trains repaired.

08:35.068 --> 08:36.602
I am so sorry.

08:36.703 --> 08:38.804
It seems like people
just don't understand

08:38.905 --> 08:41.039
what you're going through,
but I'm here for you,

08:41.140 --> 08:43.042
and we will get your memory back.

08:43.143 --> 08:45.278
No, I totally remember that guy.

08:45.379 --> 08:46.913
Really small pinkies.

08:47.014 --> 08:50.650
I remember when he picked me up
at my house in his mom's car.

08:50.751 --> 08:51.703
Your house?

08:51.728 --> 08:54.997
Oh, my God. I-I remember my house.

08:55.265 --> 08:59.135
Gray Craftsman with a-a big front porch,

08:59.393 --> 09:03.529
a chimney on the roof,
knobs on the doors,

09:03.631 --> 09:05.198
grass on the lawn,

09:05.299 --> 09:07.800
a sidewalk just beyond
the grass, and a curb...

09:07.901 --> 09:11.404
9285 Basil Drive. I know that house.

09:11.505 --> 09:12.672
L.A.P.D.

09:12.697 --> 09:13.931
We want to ask you some questions

09:13.956 --> 09:15.590
about the Baloney
motorcycle parked outside.

09:15.647 --> 09:17.531
Yeah, it's been parked out
there for eight hours.

09:17.635 --> 09:18.863
We're gonna have it towed.

09:18.888 --> 09:21.223
Any chance your cameras caught
the guy who rode it in here?

09:21.248 --> 09:22.945
It's possible, but the
manager doesn't let me

09:22.970 --> 09:24.270
mess with the security footage.

09:24.618 --> 09:25.752
Can we speak with the manager?

09:25.777 --> 09:27.878
That's me. How can I help you?

09:27.903 --> 09:29.871
We were wondering if you had
any surveillance footage

09:29.896 --> 09:31.596
of the guy who rode in on
that Baloney motorcycle.

09:31.714 --> 09:33.649
Let's take a look.

09:33.913 --> 09:35.878
Okay.

09:36.016 --> 09:37.460
Oh, check out this lady.

09:37.485 --> 09:39.124
She doesn't even buy anything.

09:39.225 --> 09:40.959
She just wants directions.

09:40.984 --> 09:42.084
[Laughs]

09:42.425 --> 09:43.825
[Laughter]

09:44.009 --> 09:46.203
Oh, this guy. You got to see this guy.

09:46.228 --> 09:48.477
He comes up, he's got two hot dogs.

09:48.502 --> 09:50.469
Suddenly, he buys a pen!

09:50.558 --> 09:52.392
Like, what?

09:52.493 --> 09:53.860
[Laughs]

09:53.961 --> 09:55.361
[Chuckles]

09:55.462 --> 09:56.362
Okay.

09:56.387 --> 09:57.621
Oh, my God. Check this out.

09:57.646 --> 10:00.515
Listen to how this guy says "nachos."

10:02.064 --> 10:03.390
We can't hear anything.

10:03.415 --> 10:06.422
Uh, uh, hang on a second.
Let me start it over.

10:07.023 --> 10:11.277
He's like, "Ooh, do you
guys have any nay-chos?"

10:11.378 --> 10:12.712
Nay-chos?

10:12.813 --> 10:17.784
I was like, "We have
some nachos over there."

10:17.809 --> 10:18.876
Random!

10:18.912 --> 10:19.845
[Laughs]

10:20.032 --> 10:22.534
Okay, Baloney motorcycle guy. Boring.

10:22.690 --> 10:23.890
Wait. Go back!

10:23.991 --> 10:25.391
You want to see the
nacho guy again, huh?

10:25.492 --> 10:27.460
Me too.

10:28.892 --> 10:30.662
This is it.

10:30.687 --> 10:34.590
My house definitely had an outside.

10:34.615 --> 10:38.218
How do you know how to do that?

10:38.243 --> 10:41.111
I just do.

10:50.851 --> 10:53.319
Absolute silence. Wait for my signal.

10:54.700 --> 10:56.501

Geils: L.A.P.D.! Drop the weapon!

11:01.289 --> 11:02.355
- Tribeca.
- Tanner?

11:02.457 --> 11:03.356
Christie.

11:03.458 --> 11:04.191
Deirdre?

11:04.292 --> 11:05.192
Tribeca?

11:05.293 --> 11:06.293
Geils.

11:06.898 --> 11:08.265
What are you guys doing here?

11:08.290 --> 11:10.191
We tracked an escaped
convict to a gas station

11:10.292 --> 11:12.627
where surveillance footage
showed him leaving a vehicle

11:12.728 --> 11:14.228
- registered at this address.
- To who?

11:14.329 --> 11:15.796
Christie Ripley, the prison guard.

11:15.898 --> 11:18.833
Who helped Edward Stracciatelli escape.

11:18.934 --> 11:20.701
And she lived here?

11:20.802 --> 11:22.737
She was forced to help him.

11:22.838 --> 11:25.206
He... He threatened her. He hurt her.

11:25.307 --> 11:27.375
We got to find this Ripley.

11:27.400 --> 11:28.500
She's right here.

11:30.083 --> 11:32.113
I get it.

11:32.357 --> 11:35.052
Christie Ripley! Los Angeles police!

11:35.077 --> 11:36.577
Geils: Tribeca.

11:39.200 --> 11:41.101
Right.

11:41.390 --> 11:43.157
We're gonna need you to step outside

11:43.258 --> 11:45.526
while we search the house
for Christie Ripley.

11:48.490 --> 11:50.748
He wanted to get revenge on his
brother for ratting him out.

11:51.123 --> 11:52.524
Geils: Theodore testified
against Edward,

11:52.549 --> 11:54.516
then he got put in the
Witness Protection program,

11:54.541 --> 11:55.466
so he should be safe.

11:55.491 --> 11:57.292
Edward said that he had
a way to find him.

11:57.304 --> 11:58.538
Impossible.

11:58.639 --> 12:00.615
I wouldn't even be able
to get his location.

12:01.436 --> 12:02.896
Oh, scratch that. It's all here.

12:02.920 --> 12:04.163
We have to go now.

12:04.188 --> 12:05.498
Edward's on the move, and the minute

12:05.523 --> 12:06.951
he kills his brother,
he's gonna disappear.

12:06.976 --> 12:08.591
Also, we could prevent the killing.

12:08.616 --> 12:09.646
I want to come.

12:09.671 --> 12:11.471
I made this mess. I
should help clean it up.

12:11.842 --> 12:12.808
Absolutely not.

12:12.909 --> 12:14.510
The location of the protected witness

12:14.611 --> 12:16.946
is one of the most
closely guarded secrets

12:17.047 --> 12:18.547
in all of law enforcement.

12:18.648 --> 12:21.183
Now, I need you to cover your
ears while I tell it to them.

12:21.697 --> 12:23.273
Sir, with all due respect,

12:23.406 --> 12:25.287
I feel like I've known Deirdre...
Christie.

12:25.388 --> 12:26.522
...for my entire life.

12:26.623 --> 12:28.424
She is a trained prison guard.

12:28.525 --> 12:30.960
She would be an enormous
asset to this investigation.

12:31.061 --> 12:33.362
Tribeca, you are asking too much.

12:33.463 --> 12:36.031
Lieutenant, I just have a
feeling about this woman.

12:36.132 --> 12:38.667
I know that she's gonna
be pivotal in this case.

12:38.768 --> 12:41.971
And if I have to stake my
entire career on it, so be it.

12:42.072 --> 12:43.172
Geils, what about you?

12:43.273 --> 12:44.807
Your career is actually promising.

12:44.908 --> 12:49.044
If Tribeca vouches for her,
then I'll vouch for her, too.

12:49.145 --> 12:52.848
Well, now I'm gonna look like
an asshole if I don't vouch.

12:52.949 --> 12:55.751
Fine, I vouch for her.
You guys are annoying.

12:55.852 --> 12:58.821
All right. She's clear
for this operation.

13:03.144 --> 13:05.779
But we are gonna need this back.

13:08.331 --> 13:11.867
â™ª

13:16.784 --> 13:18.285
You guys should go to Theodore's house.

13:18.379 --> 13:20.647
We're gonna walk through town
and see if anybody's seen him.

13:20.753 --> 13:22.042
- You be careful.
- Will do.

13:22.067 --> 13:24.369
Tribeca, remember. You're in Ratenberg.

13:24.752 --> 13:27.253
This place is known for their taffy.

13:29.556 --> 13:30.590
Let's go, Deirdre.

13:30.691 --> 13:32.892
Just a second.

13:32.993 --> 13:34.160
Ed?

13:34.261 --> 13:36.729
I'm here.

13:52.172 --> 13:54.726
Good afternoon, gentlemen.
How can I help you?

13:54.751 --> 13:58.171
Hello, ma'am. Are you Mrs., uh, Crocker?

13:58.515 --> 14:00.216
- Betty.
- I'm Detective Geils.

14:00.317 --> 14:02.084
This is Detective Tanner, L.A.P.D.

14:02.186 --> 14:04.669
We just have some questions
about your husband, uh...

14:04.694 --> 14:05.928
What was his fake name?

14:05.953 --> 14:07.187
Joe Crocker.

14:07.510 --> 14:09.144
Do you have any identification?

14:09.169 --> 14:10.336
Yes, we do.

14:10.435 --> 14:12.336
Please, come in.

14:14.858 --> 14:16.725
I am so sorry.

14:16.826 --> 14:20.229
I'm in the middle of making
dinner, and Joe is at work.

14:20.330 --> 14:22.498
Is there anything I can help you with?

14:22.599 --> 14:25.121
We believe your husband is in danger.

14:25.146 --> 14:26.580
How much do you know about his past?

14:26.870 --> 14:29.238
Joe and I met when he
got back from Haiti

14:29.339 --> 14:30.706
building churches,

14:30.731 --> 14:33.630
and we fell in love and have
been married ever since.

14:33.839 --> 14:35.844
There's fruit in that bowl
if you guys are hungry.

14:35.945 --> 14:38.680
Your husband's real name
is Theodore Stracciatelli.

14:38.782 --> 14:41.183
He put his brother Edward away for life.

14:41.284 --> 14:42.985
This morning, Edward escaped from prison

14:43.086 --> 14:44.953
and is on his way here to seek revenge.

14:45.055 --> 14:46.455
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

14:46.556 --> 14:50.392
So? They gonna assign me
a new husband or what?

14:50.493 --> 14:52.728
Wouldn't you be sad if
somebody killed your husband?

14:52.905 --> 14:55.340
He's not my husband,
and I'm not his wife.

14:55.365 --> 14:57.166
We were assigned to each other.

14:57.191 --> 14:58.491
I'm Loretta Sanchez.

14:58.668 --> 15:01.203
I found two pounds of
diamonds in the woods,

15:01.304 --> 15:03.439
and, like an idiot, I went to the cops.

15:03.540 --> 15:06.041
So, you're in Witness Protection, too?

15:06.142 --> 15:07.276
The whole town is.

15:07.453 --> 15:09.888
Why do you think it's called Ratenberg?

15:09.913 --> 15:12.214

finger-pointers,

15:14.250 --> 15:16.051
Oh, that's just the dog.

15:16.152 --> 15:18.420
Don't worry. He doesn't bite.

15:18.521 --> 15:20.155
Where can we find your husband now?

15:20.256 --> 15:22.458
He's always drinking
down at John O'Doe's.

15:22.559 --> 15:24.860
He thinks I don't know
that he hangs out there,

15:24.961 --> 15:26.628
but somebody ratted him out.

15:26.729 --> 15:27.663

- Your dad's cover is blown.

Witness Protection, too?

No, no. Are you?

15:56.643 --> 15:57.577
[Normal voice] Yes.

own twin brother, Randy,

15:59.743 --> 16:00.939

16:00.964 --> 16:03.198
Then they gave me a
new name, Tony Fudge,

16:03.604 --> 16:04.871

- No.

16:48.516 --> 16:49.818
You asked for whipped cream,
