WEBVTT

00:15.974 --> 00:19.853
-<i>We're going to sing and have some fun…</i>

00:36.202 --> 00:37.287
You smell good.

00:37.370 --> 00:38.997
Oh, it is the Hellmann's.

00:40.040 --> 00:41.624
Was that a car door?

00:43.001 --> 00:44.919
That was a car door. I got it. I got it!

00:45.503 --> 00:46.921
I got it! I got it!

00:47.005 --> 00:49.591
I got it! I got it! I got it!

00:49.674 --> 00:51.718
Oh my God. Mom, I didn't even knock.

00:54.387 --> 00:55.513
Mom.

00:55.597 --> 00:57.265
Mom, you're motorboating me.

00:58.433 --> 00:59.267
Dad.

00:59.350 --> 01:00.602
Son.

01:00.685 --> 01:01.519
Hug?

01:02.437 --> 01:04.105
Nah.

01:04.689 --> 01:06.274
Hey, Grandma. Hey, Grandpa.

01:06.357 --> 01:09.652
Leia. My grandbaby.

01:09.736 --> 01:13.281
Hey, kiddo.
Boy, you sure have gotten tall.

01:13.364 --> 01:16.826
Oh, and congratulations.
Those buds are blooming.

01:17.660 --> 01:19.287
Yours… look good too?

01:20.288 --> 01:23.208
Why, I bet you're a holy terror
on the basketball court.

01:23.291 --> 01:26.795
I hear you got your mom's jump shot
and your dad's

01:26.878 --> 01:27.879
last name.

01:29.756 --> 01:32.133
-I'm gonna take a bathroom break.
-Hey, hey, hey.

01:32.717 --> 01:36.471
Just be careful with the faucets.
The water comes out, like, scalding hot.

01:36.554 --> 01:39.808
It's a normal temperature, Eric.

01:40.600 --> 01:42.894
You've just got that sensitive baby skin.

01:44.062 --> 01:45.438
You know,

01:45.522 --> 01:49.067
I am so excited
about this Fourth of July weekend.

01:49.150 --> 01:52.570
We are gonna grill weenies,
watch the fireworks…

01:52.654 --> 01:54.405
I even rented <i>The Little Mermaid</i>.

01:54.489 --> 01:57.200
Oh. Thanks, Mom,
but she's not really into that anymore.

01:57.283 --> 01:59.661
Our little mermaid… got her period.

01:59.744 --> 02:01.371
-God, Eric!

02:03.164 --> 02:04.874
Don't worry, honey. I got it.

02:16.177 --> 02:18.388
<i>Hello, Wisconsin!</i>

02:19.013 --> 02:21.891
Who wants a warm snickerdoodle?

02:21.975 --> 02:25.353
I do. It's a little weird
that you're smelling my hair, Mom.

02:26.146 --> 02:30.024
I haven't seen you since Christmas,
so I will smell you however I want,

02:30.108 --> 02:31.860
and you're fine with it.

02:31.943 --> 02:36.489
So, Donna, Eric sent us
the review of your new book.

02:36.573 --> 02:37.490
We read it.

02:37.574 --> 02:38.825
Oh, you read my book?

02:38.908 --> 02:40.618
No, the review.

02:42.120 --> 02:43.163
Thanks, Mrs. F.

02:43.246 --> 02:44.372
Aww…

02:44.455 --> 02:47.375
-I wish you'd call me Mom, you know?
-I know.

02:48.668 --> 02:49.502
Okay.

02:49.586 --> 02:50.503
Someday.

02:50.587 --> 02:51.963
This weekend.

02:53.256 --> 02:55.466
So, Eric, how are things
at the university?

02:55.550 --> 02:57.844
Going great. I'm an adjunct professor now,

02:57.927 --> 03:00.013
which means I got
a permanent parking space

03:00.096 --> 03:01.264
for my bicycle.

03:02.432 --> 03:04.767
That's what happens
when your course is super popular, Dad.

03:04.851 --> 03:06.728
"The Religion of <i>Star Wars</i>"?

03:06.811 --> 03:08.188
Oh yeah.

03:08.271 --> 03:10.523
This country's gonna lose the next war.

03:11.107 --> 03:13.902
Not if it's an intergalactic battle
between good and evil.

03:15.028 --> 03:17.155
Hey, I'm gonna go shoot some hoops.

03:17.238 --> 03:19.657
Hey, Leia, tell your grandparents
what we're doing this summer.

03:19.741 --> 03:20.575
Oh, we're going to--

03:20.658 --> 03:23.661
We're going to Huntsville, Alabama,
for a little father-daughter Space Camp.

03:24.871 --> 03:27.498
Just the two of us… for two weeks.

03:27.582 --> 03:29.959
Houston, permission to have fun, over.

03:31.252 --> 03:33.296
Houston, do you read me, over?

03:34.756 --> 03:37.175
-Permission granted.
-Yeah!

03:38.092 --> 03:39.636
But you… you didn't say "over."

03:39.719 --> 03:42.013
-Mom?
-Okay, Leia, go shoot some baskets.

03:42.096 --> 03:44.015
I don't need you
to see your dad get any nerdier.

03:45.308 --> 03:46.684
Space Camp.

03:47.769 --> 03:50.563
Do you get to put on
a Buck Rogers costume?

03:50.647 --> 03:54.025
Nah. Only if you buy
the Command Module experience.

03:54.525 --> 03:55.777
Which I did!

03:57.528 --> 03:59.697
Leia doesn't seem like she wants to go.

03:59.781 --> 04:03.201
I think she might be
at that age where she needs space.

04:03.284 --> 04:05.787
I'm giving her space… camp.

04:07.789 --> 04:10.667
-Space Camp.
-Eric's having a hard time with Leia.

04:10.750 --> 04:12.919
It's a tough age… 38.

04:13.002 --> 04:14.212
Okay. Okay.

04:14.295 --> 04:19.217
All I know is that I'm going to love her
and stand behind her, no matter what.

04:19.300 --> 04:21.010
That is a great idea.

04:21.678 --> 04:25.348
Because when you stand
behind your kids, it's easier--

04:25.431 --> 04:27.016
To put your foot in their ass.

04:27.100 --> 04:28.393
We got it, Dad. Thanks.

05:00.008 --> 05:00.967
Hello.

05:01.843 --> 05:03.386
What are you doing, creeper?

05:03.469 --> 05:04.762
Oh, nothing weird!

05:04.846 --> 05:07.181
I was just standing outside your window
and watching you sing

05:07.265 --> 05:10.768
and wondering
what it would be like to… be you.

05:11.936 --> 05:13.438
I'll go now.

05:13.521 --> 05:16.441
Unless you want to hear
a cool bootleg I got in Chicago.

05:16.524 --> 05:17.775
Oh, I'm listening.

05:17.859 --> 05:19.485
Yeah, it's, uh, pretty major.

05:20.570 --> 05:21.571
Big-time bootleg.

05:22.238 --> 05:24.115
The bootiest of legs.

05:25.074 --> 05:25.908
Just go get it.

05:25.992 --> 05:26.868
On it.

05:27.910 --> 05:29.620
Please be here when I get back.

05:32.582 --> 05:36.753
So this was your mom's old room,
and your dad lived next door?

05:37.378 --> 05:39.630
I bet they boned in here all the time.

05:40.923 --> 05:41.883
Explains a lot.

05:42.675 --> 05:43.760
Sometimes,

05:43.843 --> 05:44.969
late at night,

05:45.636 --> 05:47.221
when everything's quiet,

05:48.097 --> 05:49.390
I can still hear the…

05:52.727 --> 05:55.688
Sorry. I love making people
feel uncomfortable.

05:56.397 --> 05:57.774
You're really good at it.

05:59.484 --> 06:02.278
Anyway, tell me about Chicago.
What are you into?

06:02.362 --> 06:04.280
Me? Uh, a lot of stuff.

06:05.740 --> 06:06.741
School.

06:07.867 --> 06:08.785
School's a big one.

06:09.911 --> 06:11.788
And I'm a pretty big deal in Debate Club.

06:12.288 --> 06:13.706
<i>That's </i>not up for debate.

06:14.582 --> 06:16.000
Yeah, I'm not popular.

06:17.460 --> 06:18.503
Good.

06:18.586 --> 06:19.712
Popular people suck.

06:20.588 --> 06:21.672
Yeah, they really do.

06:21.756 --> 06:23.049
Ooh, this part's dope.

06:27.845 --> 06:28.805
Damn it, Gwen!

06:28.888 --> 06:31.349
Turn that crap down. I'm trying to shave.

06:32.683 --> 06:35.478
Older brother. Different dads. He's cool.

06:35.561 --> 06:37.980
Mostly 'cause he has a van,
and he's fun to mess with.

06:38.064 --> 06:40.066
-Watch this.

06:40.149 --> 06:43.027
Seriously, Gwen. I almost nicked my nerps.

06:43.111 --> 06:46.072
This whiny vagina music is bumming me out!

06:46.155 --> 06:47.782
-Oh yeah, Nate?

06:47.865 --> 06:50.868
Me and my new friend are gonna
start a band and call it Whiny Vagina.

06:50.952 --> 06:53.955
I'm gonna start a band
and call it That's Stupid.

06:55.289 --> 06:56.332
Nice.

07:00.002 --> 07:01.254
Damn it, Gwen!

07:03.089 --> 07:05.341
I love having the house full again.

07:05.425 --> 07:07.510
It just… It fills me with joy.

07:08.094 --> 07:10.221
And then you leave, and it's sad.

07:11.472 --> 07:13.057
And then winter comes.

07:14.142 --> 07:16.060
And I visit Mom's grave.

07:16.811 --> 07:20.314
And I tell her how much fun it was
when the house was full.

07:24.068 --> 07:26.195
-So can I have the syrup now?
-Oh, of course.

07:27.196 --> 07:28.197
Morning. Bye.

07:28.281 --> 07:30.533
Whoa. What the hell is that thing
in your nose?

07:30.616 --> 07:31.492
Uh, a nose ring?

07:32.660 --> 07:33.911
Your move, baby skin.

07:36.122 --> 07:37.999
-How did this happen?
-Gwen gave it to me.

07:38.082 --> 07:40.710
Oh! Okay, it was Gwen.
Cool. I didn't know it was Gwen.

07:40.793 --> 07:42.003
Question before you leave.

07:42.086 --> 07:44.589
Who is Gwen, and why is she
poking holes in your perfect face?

07:46.424 --> 07:49.010
She lives next door,
which is where I'm going right now.

07:49.093 --> 07:51.429
-Are her parents home?
-No, but her older brother is.

07:51.512 --> 07:54.348
Honey, you're really
not helping your case.

07:56.267 --> 07:58.060
Dad, I'll be 20 feet away.

07:58.936 --> 08:01.397
Okay, you can go, but you have to be
home in time for fireworks.

08:01.481 --> 08:02.440
-Okay?
-I'll try.

08:02.523 --> 08:03.441
Ah, ah, ah, ah!

08:03.524 --> 08:04.609
As Master Yoda said--

08:04.692 --> 08:05.818
-Why?

08:05.902 --> 08:10.865
As Master Yoda said,
"Do or do not. There is no try."

08:10.948 --> 08:15.286
Master Yoda was a puppet from a fake
world with some guy's hand up his butt.

08:16.954 --> 08:18.706
Now you're just being hurtful.

08:18.789 --> 08:20.708
Ah, teenagers!

08:20.791 --> 08:22.293
I feel for you, son.

08:23.753 --> 08:25.296
But, on the other hand,

08:25.963 --> 08:27.840
payback's a bitch.

08:35.640 --> 08:36.474
Uno.

08:38.226 --> 08:40.311
I think you're only allowed
to drop one card.

08:40.394 --> 08:41.395
Excuse me?

08:43.940 --> 08:44.857
Cool basement.

08:44.941 --> 08:45.775
It's a dump.

08:46.984 --> 08:48.194
No offense.

08:49.028 --> 08:51.155
Ozzie and I met last year in detention.

08:51.239 --> 08:52.323
Tell her what you did.

08:52.406 --> 08:55.076
I told my math teacher
his wife was cheating on him.

08:55.159 --> 08:57.078
She was making out with some dude at IHOP.

08:57.161 --> 08:59.121
-That's horrible.
-I know.

08:59.205 --> 09:00.456
IHOP.

09:00.540 --> 09:01.916
Show some class.

09:03.167 --> 09:06.045
You're not gonna believe what happened.
It's the best thing ever!

09:06.128 --> 09:08.756
That's what you said
when the McRib came back.

09:08.839 --> 09:10.466
I thought it was gone forever, Nik.

09:10.550 --> 09:12.468
Aww! You were scared?

09:13.135 --> 09:14.804
Oh, babe.

09:21.394 --> 09:22.228
Hey, new girl.

09:23.604 --> 09:24.939
Hey, boy.

09:26.899 --> 09:27.733
Man…?

09:28.859 --> 09:31.237
I don't know how
the whole puberty thing is going for you.

09:31.320 --> 09:32.697
Probably great.

09:33.447 --> 09:34.574
Leia, this is Jay.

09:35.074 --> 09:38.786
Please place all your zippers and buttons
in their upright and locked positions.

09:38.869 --> 09:42.582
Hey, not cool, Gwen. I'm just doing
a little get-to-know-you chitchat.

09:43.833 --> 09:44.667
So,

09:45.918 --> 09:47.003
are you spiritual?

09:48.337 --> 09:49.171
I am.

09:50.423 --> 09:52.049
You're making a face.

09:52.133 --> 09:54.135
But that would have worked on me.

09:55.428 --> 09:57.138
Can I tell my awesome story now?

09:57.638 --> 09:59.849
So we were just chilling in my van.

10:00.349 --> 10:03.269
-Why does he always get to sit in front?
-I called shotgun.

10:03.352 --> 10:05.896
-But I'm your girlfriend.
-Yeah, but he's my <i>best </i>friend.

10:07.648 --> 10:09.317
-Bro.
-Bro.

10:10.359 --> 10:11.360
Bro.

10:13.112 --> 10:14.113
Bro.

10:15.948 --> 10:18.284
Oh my God. I turned down a senior for you.

10:19.035 --> 10:21.495
I'm sorry, babe,
but you're both important to me.

10:21.579 --> 10:23.748
But Jay's had my back
for the past 12 years,

10:23.831 --> 10:27.293
and you've had my front
for the last six months. I can't choose.

10:27.376 --> 10:30.463
Hey. Are you here to pick up the keg
from Mama's Discount Liquors?

10:33.090 --> 10:34.091
-Yes.
-Yes.

10:34.175 --> 10:35.426
And you prepaid, right?

10:37.386 --> 10:38.220
-Yes.
-Yes.

10:38.304 --> 10:39.430
Sweet.

10:44.810 --> 10:45.728
Happy Fourth.

10:48.773 --> 10:50.149
-Bro!
-Bro!

10:50.650 --> 10:51.567
-Bro.
-Bro.

10:51.651 --> 10:53.027
-Bro. Bro!
-Bro. Bro!

10:53.110 --> 10:53.986
-Bro!
-Bro.

10:54.070 --> 10:54.987
-Bro.
-Bro.

10:55.071 --> 10:56.697
They were like this the whole ride.

10:57.865 --> 11:00.868
Come on, babe.
It's a Fourth of July miracle.

11:01.369 --> 11:02.203
With beer!

11:02.286 --> 11:05.956
Why are we still talking?
Let's tap that keg and get stupid!

11:06.040 --> 11:07.667
-Yeah.
-Oh no.

11:09.001 --> 11:10.211
We don't have a tap.

11:10.961 --> 11:13.673
And, without a tap,
the beer is… is trapped.

11:14.465 --> 11:18.386
-Would a kiss make it better?
-Not unless you have a mouth full of beer.

11:20.471 --> 11:22.098
-Do you?
-No, I don't.

11:28.145 --> 11:29.271
This feels weird.

11:30.606 --> 11:32.692
Very different.

11:33.484 --> 11:35.027
Well, I'm having fun.

11:37.279 --> 11:38.781
Why is it so smoky?

11:39.699 --> 11:41.325
Oh God, the popcorn!

11:42.702 --> 11:44.995
Enjoying yourselves, kids?

11:45.955 --> 11:48.040
You're upstairs people now.

11:49.417 --> 11:50.918
I knew it would happen.

11:51.419 --> 11:52.753
Just not this soon.

11:54.630 --> 11:57.049
Quit worrying, Eric. Leia will be fine.

11:57.758 --> 11:59.343
So now you can tell the future?

11:59.427 --> 12:01.929
Where were you when I bought
those slippery brown shoes?

12:02.012 --> 12:03.931
I couldn't get up the ramp at the airport.

12:04.014 --> 12:05.099
Okay, Eric.

12:08.144 --> 12:09.395
No more Zima for you.

12:10.604 --> 12:12.898
Yeah, you're right. I'm… I'm flying.

12:14.108 --> 12:15.609
I saved most of it.

12:15.693 --> 12:16.861
Ah. Thanks, Mom.

12:17.820 --> 12:18.654
"Mom."

12:19.155 --> 12:21.157
You see how easy it is, Donna?

12:22.742 --> 12:24.744
Can't you just say it?

12:25.828 --> 12:27.830
Nah. Feels forced.

12:28.581 --> 12:30.082
Come on, Mom, just drop it.

12:30.958 --> 12:31.876
Nah.

12:32.376 --> 12:33.586
Feels forced.

12:41.093 --> 12:42.344
Kids versus beer.

12:43.095 --> 12:44.722
It's a tale as old as time.

12:45.306 --> 12:48.809
It happened to our parents
and our parents' parents.

12:48.893 --> 12:50.269
The kids on the Mayflower.

12:50.770 --> 12:54.356
Ozzie. You're killing me, man.
I'm trying to think here.

12:54.440 --> 12:56.484
I know. I can smell it.

12:57.818 --> 13:01.530
Wait, why can't we just
go back to Mama's and get a tap?

13:02.114 --> 13:04.658
We've all tried to buy from her,
but she's tough.

13:04.742 --> 13:06.702
I mean, I even hit her with the,

13:08.120 --> 13:09.121
"Hey, girl."

13:10.039 --> 13:10.873
Nothing.

13:12.124 --> 13:15.127
-What if we get a laser?
-We're not getting a laser.

13:16.086 --> 13:18.214
Well, I guess that's it.
We tried everything.

13:18.297 --> 13:20.549
You said one idea, and it was stupid.

13:20.633 --> 13:21.592
You're stupid!

13:21.675 --> 13:24.595
You're all stupid!
You hate beer and you hate America.

13:24.678 --> 13:25.971
-Baby?
-Yeah?

13:26.055 --> 13:27.556
Are you feeling frustrated?

13:27.640 --> 13:28.474
Yeah.

13:28.557 --> 13:31.894
-Is this why you're lashing out at others?
-Yeah.

13:33.479 --> 13:37.525
How about tomorrow we go into the woods,
and I watch you do karate on a tree?

13:37.608 --> 13:38.859
-I'd really like that.
-Oh.

13:40.528 --> 13:41.987
Are you dill weeds finished?

13:42.071 --> 13:45.324
Leia, you should buy the tap.
Mama doesn't know you.

13:45.407 --> 13:47.201
Oh yeah. You totally could.

13:47.284 --> 13:50.120
Plus, your eyes are crazy pretty,
which won't really help get the tap,

13:50.204 --> 13:51.789
but it's something I noticed.

13:53.207 --> 13:54.750
-Hey, girl.

13:55.709 --> 13:58.587
Leia, it would be so badass.

13:59.171 --> 14:01.340
I guess I have done
some pretty crazy things.

14:01.423 --> 14:04.301
One time at the beach,
a seagull stole my sandwich,

14:04.385 --> 14:08.055
and, under my breath,
I… called her "bitch."

14:10.891 --> 14:12.309
You know what? I'm in.

14:12.893 --> 14:14.478
All right. New girl is sick.

14:14.562 --> 14:16.105
-To the van!
-Pause.

14:17.398 --> 14:18.774
This isn't gonna work.

14:18.858 --> 14:21.443
I'm pretty sure OshKosh B'gosh here
is gonna get carded.

14:22.987 --> 14:23.988
Good point.

14:25.072 --> 14:26.073
I have an idea.

14:31.662 --> 14:33.956
You sure you want to be drinking
in your condition, hon?

14:34.039 --> 14:35.457
Oh, it's…

14:35.541 --> 14:38.961
It's for my husband.
He… He got a keg for the baby shower.

14:39.837 --> 14:41.380
Oh, fancy.

14:43.632 --> 14:45.968
-That'll be $39.50.
-Okay.

14:50.014 --> 14:53.559
I'm no lady doctor, but I think
something's wrong with the baby.

14:55.352 --> 14:56.186
Nice try.

14:56.270 --> 14:58.480
I'm sick of you kids.
I'm calling the cops.

14:59.523 --> 15:01.483
Put the phone down, Mama.

15:01.567 --> 15:02.693
Shut up.

15:02.776 --> 15:04.570
Fine, but when the cops get here,

15:04.653 --> 15:08.240
how are you gonna explain to them
why you gave a keg to a bunch of kids?

15:08.324 --> 15:09.909
It wasn't me. It was Wade.

15:09.992 --> 15:10.868
Mama!

15:12.828 --> 15:15.539
Either way, you lose your liquor license.

15:15.623 --> 15:20.961
So put the phone down, sell me the tap,
and we all have a nice Fourth of July.

15:24.214 --> 15:26.050
What are you, some sort of lawyer?

15:26.133 --> 15:29.303
Debate Club.
First place, junior regionals.

15:29.386 --> 15:31.013
It was over before it started.

15:36.685 --> 15:39.313
To Leia, the Mama slayer!

15:39.396 --> 15:40.773
To Leia!

15:40.856 --> 15:43.317
And to Mrs. Zapolski.

15:43.400 --> 15:46.111
My Debate Club coach,
for pushing me so damn hard.

15:46.195 --> 15:48.489
To Mrs. Zapolski!

15:49.698 --> 15:53.327
Wow. Look, Nik, a shooting star.
Make a wish.

15:53.410 --> 15:54.745
That's a firework, babe.

15:56.205 --> 15:59.792
Man, you were such a badass tonight.
I didn't know you had it in you.

16:00.292 --> 16:04.254
Neither did I, but I love this feeling.

16:04.338 --> 16:08.968
I feel free and happy.
Wish I could stay for the summer.

16:10.135 --> 16:11.136
Then stay.

16:11.220 --> 16:13.305
My dad will never let me.

16:14.014 --> 16:15.599
When my parents split up,

16:15.683 --> 16:19.478
the school shrink basically told me
that everything was gonna suck forever,

16:19.979 --> 16:23.357
and I was like, "Nope. Not this girl."

16:23.440 --> 16:26.402
So I went home, bleached my hair
over the washing machine,

16:26.485 --> 16:29.071
cut up my jeans
and decided that this is <i>my</i> life,

16:29.154 --> 16:30.489
and it's <i>never </i>gonna suck.

16:32.866 --> 16:34.827
This is gonna sound so dorky,

16:34.910 --> 16:38.247
but… I'm interested in
us becoming best friends,

16:38.330 --> 16:39.707
so how do we make that happen?

16:40.582 --> 16:41.792
Stay for the summer.

16:42.710 --> 16:45.337
And you can drop the dorky disclaimer.
It's implied.

16:46.964 --> 16:48.257
Oh great.

16:48.340 --> 16:50.968
Now she's missed the fireworks
and the weenies.

16:51.051 --> 16:55.305
Now they're sitting on a plate
all cold and shriveled just like my heart.

16:55.806 --> 16:57.933
Oh, Eric.

16:58.017 --> 17:00.269
The hair thing,
it's still a little weird, Mom.

17:00.811 --> 17:03.355
Know what the worst part is?
I should be treasuring time with Leia.

17:03.439 --> 17:06.066
Instead, I mean,
I… can't wait for it to end.

17:06.650 --> 17:07.985
Oh, sweetie.

17:08.068 --> 17:09.987
It ends when you die.

17:13.532 --> 17:15.784
Leia Tatooine Forman.

17:16.660 --> 17:19.329
-Her middle name is Anne.
-Know what? I never agreed to that.

17:19.830 --> 17:22.332
Where have you been?
Oh my God. Is that beer?

17:22.416 --> 17:25.419
Yeah. And I spilled the rest
coming down the water tower.

17:25.502 --> 17:27.671
The… water tower? What the hell?

17:27.755 --> 17:29.089
Eric, let me handle this.

17:29.173 --> 17:30.799
The water tower? What the hell?

17:30.883 --> 17:33.302
Now, this is <i>my </i>kind of fireworks.

17:35.637 --> 17:37.097
Yes, the water tower.

17:37.181 --> 17:40.017
And I had a great time
and I don't want it to end.

17:40.517 --> 17:42.394
So I know you're not
gonna like me saying this,

17:42.478 --> 17:44.980
but… I want to stay in Point Place
for the summer.

17:45.564 --> 17:47.983
This is my life,
and I'm done letting it suck.

17:48.067 --> 17:49.276
-Leia.
-Yeah, go.

17:49.359 --> 17:51.403
Just unload, baby. Both barrels. Go.

17:52.780 --> 17:55.032
-That took courage. I'm impressed.
-What?!

17:55.115 --> 17:56.950
Th-This is a ridiculous idea.

17:57.034 --> 17:59.369
-Leia.
-Mom, just go, preach.

17:59.453 --> 18:02.498
You are welcome to stay here
if that's what you want.

18:02.581 --> 18:04.249
Oh my God! What's happening?

18:04.333 --> 18:05.167
Kitty.

18:06.585 --> 18:08.712
I guess that's what we want.

18:11.381 --> 18:13.133
Dad, you guys always talk about

18:13.217 --> 18:15.219
the amazing times
you had with your friends.

18:15.302 --> 18:17.262
I want that. I want amazing.

18:17.346 --> 18:19.264
Listen, pal. In the space of one day,

18:19.348 --> 18:22.017
you've gotten pierced, you've gotten beer,
and you've gotten

18:22.643 --> 18:24.311
extremely snippy.

18:24.978 --> 18:27.272
You've turned into someone
that I don't know anymore.

18:27.356 --> 18:29.024
So no. You know what? You can forget it.

18:29.108 --> 18:30.859
I knew you were gonna be like this.

18:30.943 --> 18:32.903
I'm not getting in that car tomorrow!
You can't make me!

18:32.986 --> 18:35.614
Oh, you're getting in that car
or my foot is getting in your ass!

18:38.826 --> 18:41.620
-Oh, Eric.
-So bad.

18:42.663 --> 18:45.207
I have never been prouder.

18:46.542 --> 18:50.170
It's like watching you hit
your first home run.

18:51.296 --> 18:52.589
If you had ever done that.

19:01.181 --> 19:02.182
You okay?

19:03.267 --> 19:04.393
I can't believe it.

19:04.476 --> 19:07.187
I study <i>Star Wars</i> my entire life,
and in my moment of truth,

19:07.271 --> 19:09.523
I turn into my evil father.

19:12.818 --> 19:13.986
I've thought about it.

19:14.486 --> 19:17.781
Leia staying isn't the craziest idea.
Your parents can watch her.

19:17.865 --> 19:19.700
Were you not here with me in the '70s?

19:19.783 --> 19:21.410
They are not the best watchers.

19:22.494 --> 19:23.662
She's a great kid.

19:25.956 --> 19:26.832
Yeah, I know.

19:26.915 --> 19:28.167
We can trust her.

19:28.250 --> 19:29.293
I know.

19:29.793 --> 19:31.044
So what, then?

19:31.128 --> 19:32.296
I just…

19:32.379 --> 19:35.174
I mean, I can't stand this feeling.
She doesn't need me anymore.

19:36.091 --> 19:38.510
I mean, she was my little buddy,
and now she's like

19:39.428 --> 19:40.596
a stranger.

19:40.679 --> 19:44.308
She's not a stranger.
She's just… growing up.

19:45.726 --> 19:46.560
I don't like it.

19:46.643 --> 19:49.688
What? But you're so good
at hiding your emotions.

19:52.983 --> 19:54.610
Eric, it's gonna be okay.

19:55.777 --> 19:56.820
We have our whole lives

19:56.904 --> 19:59.323
because your parents
gave us the space to find each other.

20:01.408 --> 20:02.409
Really?

20:02.492 --> 20:05.913
You lived 20 feet away. I'm pretty sure
we would have found each other.

20:19.801 --> 20:20.802
Hey.

20:21.637 --> 20:22.638
What?

20:23.347 --> 20:25.891
-Oh, what happened to the nose ring?
-It was a magnet.

20:25.974 --> 20:27.976
I sneezed and it went down the drain.

20:28.060 --> 20:29.061
Ah.

20:30.270 --> 20:31.980
Well, I'm… I'm heartbroken.

20:33.273 --> 20:34.399
Back when I was your age,

20:34.483 --> 20:36.860
my friends and I pretty much
lived down in this basement.

20:36.944 --> 20:41.073
We'd kill time, listen to music,
do… other things.

20:42.449 --> 20:46.119
Sitting on those stairs right there
when I fell in love with your mom.

20:47.120 --> 20:49.456
Oh God. Did you do it on those stairs too?

20:49.539 --> 20:50.499
No.

20:53.877 --> 20:54.878
No.

20:56.713 --> 20:58.757
Look, I've been thinking about it, and…

21:01.343 --> 21:03.303
You should stay… for the summer.

21:04.805 --> 21:06.473
-Are you for real?
-Yeah.

21:07.224 --> 21:11.395
If anyone deserves some… amazing,
it's you.

21:11.979 --> 21:15.774
Oh my God, Dad. Thank you.
Sorry I was kind of a jerk.

21:15.857 --> 21:18.151
Well, you were
surprisingly good at it.

21:19.486 --> 21:20.737
But, you know, you're…

21:22.698 --> 21:23.699
You're good at everything.

21:27.703 --> 21:28.829
I'll miss you, pal.

21:30.080 --> 21:31.581
I love you so much, okay?

21:34.418 --> 21:36.003
Are you smelling my hair?

21:36.086 --> 21:37.421
No.

21:38.505 --> 21:40.632
'Cause that would be weird.

21:42.384 --> 21:43.677
Okay.

21:50.851 --> 21:54.062
So just remember
our phone number hasn't changed, okay?

21:55.480 --> 21:57.774
Don't worry, honey. I got it.

21:58.400 --> 21:59.234
Again.

22:00.569 --> 22:01.570
Okay, babe.

22:03.405 --> 22:05.073
My baby boy.

22:05.574 --> 22:07.909
Oh, uh… Mom.

22:07.993 --> 22:09.745
Shh!

22:09.828 --> 22:11.872
I'm listening to your heartbeat.

22:13.165 --> 22:14.166
Look. Okay.

22:21.715 --> 22:22.632
Love you, Le-Le.

22:22.716 --> 22:23.633
Bye, Mom.

22:24.760 --> 22:27.888
Don't worry. We're gonna have fun.

22:27.971 --> 22:29.306
You ever cleaned an oven?

22:30.432 --> 22:31.433
Good luck.

22:32.309 --> 22:35.187
And one more thing, Leia.
This one's… really important.

22:35.270 --> 22:38.607
With your new friends, I want you
to hang out in Grandpa's basement

22:38.690 --> 22:40.192
as much as possible.

22:40.275 --> 22:42.361
No. Uh-uh. No way.

22:42.444 --> 22:44.154
It is the safest place for her.

22:44.237 --> 22:47.240
That's right, Mom. That's so right.

22:47.324 --> 22:48.950
Nicely played, son.

22:49.034 --> 22:50.327
I learned from the best.

22:50.410 --> 22:51.870
Nobody likes an ass-kisser.

22:54.206 --> 22:55.123
I love you too, Dad.

22:57.584 --> 22:58.585
Bye, Mom.

23:01.546 --> 23:03.215
She said "Mom."

23:05.175 --> 23:06.343
I win.

23:07.511 --> 23:09.721
That's why you don't mess with a pro.

23:15.227 --> 23:17.771
Well, I have to make a shopping list.

23:17.854 --> 23:19.606
The kids are gonna want snacks.

23:19.689 --> 23:21.441
Don't feed them, Kitty.

23:21.525 --> 23:23.819
That's how it started the first time.

23:24.403 --> 23:26.571
Hey. Me and my friends
are going up to the lake.

23:26.655 --> 23:27.489
Hold on.

23:28.281 --> 23:30.117
-Who are you?
-I'm Jay.

23:31.576 --> 23:32.953
-Jay Kelso.
-No!

23:33.912 --> 23:35.038
Uh-uh!

23:35.122 --> 23:36.164
No way!

23:36.248 --> 23:38.375
Buuuurn!

23:42.295 --> 23:43.296
Ahh!

23:43.380 --> 23:45.757
See you met my boy here, huh?
Look at this guy. Look at him.

23:45.841 --> 23:48.301
Look, he's got his dad's looks
and his mom's brains.

23:48.385 --> 23:49.719
Straight A's last year.

23:49.803 --> 23:51.888
Sweet Lord, it's evolving.

23:53.807 --> 23:55.809
Hey, you kids. You have fun now, okay?

23:55.892 --> 23:58.061
Oh, and if you jump off that cliff,

23:58.145 --> 23:59.187
do it naked.

23:59.271 --> 24:01.731
Okay? 'Cause when you hit the water
at the right angle,

24:01.815 --> 24:03.275
it's like doing it with a lake.

24:07.654 --> 24:08.697
Hello, Michael.

24:08.780 --> 24:09.656
Hey, girl.

24:11.575 --> 24:13.285
Beautiful!

24:15.912 --> 24:19.666
-Well, that felt… toned and warm.
-Oh.

24:21.084 --> 24:21.918
So, Red,

24:22.502 --> 24:25.672
we need to talk about your granddaughter's
intentions with my boy.

24:27.174 --> 24:29.801
No, I'm just kidding ya.
Come on. Let's hug it out.

24:29.885 --> 24:31.136
What do you think?

24:32.012 --> 24:33.472
Michael, let's go!

24:35.056 --> 24:35.974
Hi, Kitty.

24:37.017 --> 24:40.020
Damn, Jackie, will you just
give me a minute to enjoy this?

24:40.103 --> 24:41.021
Oh my God.

24:41.521 --> 24:44.107
The vein on Red's forehead
is about to explode.

24:45.484 --> 24:49.488
Gross! I don't want old guy blood
all over my wedding outfit.

24:49.571 --> 24:50.906
You're getting married?

24:50.989 --> 24:52.407
Remarried.

24:52.491 --> 24:54.409
-Yeah, it's our second remarriage.
-Mm-hmm.

24:55.702 --> 24:57.537
-This one's gonna stick, right?
-Yeah.

24:59.372 --> 25:00.707
Jackie.

25:00.790 --> 25:01.958
White, honey?

25:03.668 --> 25:04.836
Really?

25:04.920 --> 25:06.838
It's before Labor Day.

25:07.339 --> 25:10.467
And, if people think it's our first time,
we'll get better gifts.

25:10.550 --> 25:14.095
Oh! FYI, we're registered
at Bloomingdale's,

25:14.179 --> 25:15.222
and I will judge.

25:15.305 --> 25:17.724
-Let's go, Michael!
-Oh God!

25:26.691 --> 25:28.693
Well, let's just make the best of it.

25:28.777 --> 25:30.278
I am heading to the market

25:30.362 --> 25:34.783
'cause I'm going to get Fritos,
Tostitos, Doritos. All the "itos."

25:34.866 --> 25:36.493
I am back, baby!

25:42.666 --> 25:44.251
Son of a bitch.

25:47.837 --> 25:51.550
Okay, kids, the basement is all yours.

25:51.633 --> 25:54.344
Lights on, shirts on, and no dancing.

25:55.595 --> 25:58.139
No dancing.
You're like the guy from <i>Footloose.</i>

26:00.433 --> 26:01.476
No dancing, you guys.

26:02.644 --> 26:06.481
Babe, you can fit three of your basements
in this basement.

26:07.399 --> 26:09.526
That sounds like a lot of work, Nik.

26:09.609 --> 26:11.319
Let's just use <i>this </i>basement.

26:13.196 --> 26:15.073
Don't you love all this old furniture?

26:15.156 --> 26:18.577
Yeah, all we need are some throw pillows
and a tetanus shot.

26:19.077 --> 26:22.956
Mrs. Forman, your home is so warm
and inviting.

26:23.039 --> 26:26.710
I mean, I can't wait to spend
all summer inside of it.

26:28.253 --> 26:29.921
What is wrong with you?

26:32.340 --> 26:33.592
Anyway… Okay.

26:33.675 --> 26:39.681
Now, if you kids get bored, I found
some old records and games of your dad's,

26:39.764 --> 26:43.018
and a few magazines
that I don't think he wanted me to see,

26:43.101 --> 26:44.561
but I got rid of them.

26:44.644 --> 26:45.812
They were all redheads.

26:45.895 --> 26:47.689
He sure has a type!

26:48.940 --> 26:50.734
Anyhoo, you guys have fun.

26:54.487 --> 26:57.824
Whoa, this must be from a Nintendo Zero.

27:01.202 --> 27:02.454
No way.

27:03.330 --> 27:05.206
Your grandma just hooked us up.

27:05.790 --> 27:07.334
-No way.
-Hell yeah.

27:07.417 --> 27:08.627
Totally.

27:10.253 --> 27:11.087
What is it?

27:11.796 --> 27:14.132
Best summer ever!

27:15.634 --> 27:16.843
Sign me up!

27:18.094 --> 27:19.596
But seriously, what is it?

27:23.475 --> 27:24.517
<i>One, two, three, four!</i>

27:24.601 --> 27:28.813
It's the summer. Let's have fun.
We should do whatever we want. Right?

27:28.897 --> 27:29.981
Wrong.

27:30.065 --> 27:32.442
-You know what I want?
-Don't say Jay.

27:32.525 --> 27:33.526
Jay.

27:34.778 --> 27:37.947
-You are banned from this house. Get out.
-No!

27:38.531 --> 27:41.576
Donna, it's Kitty!
Your daughter is about to have sex!

27:41.660 --> 27:42.535
Where is she?

27:42.619 --> 27:45.080
Wait, so Dad wasn't as smooth
as he says he was?

27:45.747 --> 27:47.415
Let's just say you're lucky you exist.

27:47.916 --> 27:49.793
Hey, which one of you yelled at my kids?

27:49.876 --> 27:52.170
I don't know which ones are yours,
but they deserved it.

27:52.253 --> 27:54.089
That's Gwen and Nate, and thanks.

27:54.172 --> 27:55.965
I was pregnant with him for ten months.

27:56.049 --> 27:58.635
The doctor said it was okay,
but I don't think it was.

27:58.718 --> 28:02.263
I think you might be having
a reaction to one of my Lip Smackers.

28:02.764 --> 28:03.682
Really?

28:04.599 --> 28:08.103
-I want to come out to your grandmother.
-I have an interview tomorrow.

28:08.186 --> 28:11.439
-Do you have any references?
-Oh, my bosses all loved me.

28:11.523 --> 28:12.482
But they are dead.

28:15.151 --> 28:17.237
I'm gaaaay!

28:18.780 --> 28:19.948
I said, good day.
