00:34.076 --> 00:35.919
Welcome to Speakerz Music.

00:35.911 --> 00:38.130
Can I help you find something?
Yes.

00:38.121 --> 00:40.123
I have discovered
this new singer.

00:40.123 --> 00:43.127
His name is Michael Buble.

00:43.126 --> 00:44.423
He's a crooner.

00:44.419 --> 00:46.547
Huh. I always
assumed that

00:46.547 --> 00:48.424
people who wanted
to buy that type of music

00:48.423 --> 00:51.142
would do it anonymously online.

00:51.134 --> 00:53.478
You can buy music online?

00:55.138 --> 00:57.732
Ooh... I, I need the cassette.

00:57.724 --> 00:59.101
Cassette?

01:00.477 --> 01:02.445
Hey, do you have
that song that goes:

01:06.149 --> 01:08.698
I'm sorry,
I got to... yeah.

01:13.156 --> 01:15.158
If you ask me, people gave up

01:15.158 --> 01:17.081
on cassingles much too quickly.

01:21.123 --> 01:24.047
Huh. Remember that old
polygamist compound?

01:24.209 --> 01:26.086
Looks like they turned
it into a restaurant.

01:26.253 --> 01:28.301
I had no idea.

01:28.297 --> 01:30.391
I realized something
today, Hank.

01:30.382 --> 01:33.431
I don't move and shake
the way I used to.

01:33.427 --> 01:35.304
I'm just not as plugged in
anymore.

01:35.304 --> 01:36.931
Well, sure you're plugged in.

01:36.930 --> 01:39.308
You're the one who told us
about aloe vera.

01:41.143 --> 01:43.145
Am I just going to listen
to the same cassettes

01:43.145 --> 01:45.898
and wear the same clothes
until the day I die?

01:45.897 --> 01:47.865
Well, not if they wear out.

01:49.151 --> 01:51.745
Hank, I don't want to be
one of those people

01:51.737 --> 01:54.160
who still writes checks
at the grocery store,

01:54.156 --> 01:56.375
or wears sweatpants to the mall.

01:56.366 --> 01:58.118
Not yet.

01:58.118 --> 02:00.962
You know, from the dates
on these tapes,

02:00.954 --> 02:05.300
I lost touch 12...
Nope, 13 years ago.

02:05.292 --> 02:06.589
I wonder what happened to me.

02:06.585 --> 02:08.086
Hey, guys.

02:08.086 --> 02:09.713
Hmm, I guess we'll never know.

02:12.299 --> 02:13.471
Hey, Dad?

02:13.467 --> 02:14.719
I was thinking.

02:14.718 --> 02:17.096
One of the things
I like most about you

02:17.095 --> 02:19.848
is that you have
such good manners.

02:19.848 --> 02:21.145
Thank you.

02:21.141 --> 02:24.020
There's this class I can
take that could teach me,

02:24.019 --> 02:26.113
well, to be more like you.

02:26.271 --> 02:29.070
What kind of class is that?

02:29.066 --> 02:30.659
It's called cotillion.

02:30.651 --> 02:31.948
"Cotillion."

02:31.943 --> 02:34.162
Isn't that where
the girls learn to curtsey

02:34.154 --> 02:36.907
and wave their
handkerchiefs and whatnot?

02:36.907 --> 02:39.035
The girls do that, and the boys

02:39.034 --> 02:41.036
learn to be little gentlemen.

02:41.036 --> 02:43.630
And it only takes six Saturdays.

02:43.622 --> 02:45.044
Uh...

02:45.207 --> 02:49.007
you know, Bobby, ROTC has
an after-school program.

02:49.002 --> 02:51.881
They'll teach you manners
and military history.

02:51.880 --> 02:53.598
I think that's a better option.

02:54.966 --> 02:56.309
Here's the deal, Dad.

02:56.301 --> 02:58.144
I'm in a dating rut.

02:58.136 --> 03:00.138
Because of all my comedy bits,

03:00.138 --> 03:02.015
I'm in the friend zone

03:02.015 --> 03:03.358
with the girls at school.

03:03.350 --> 03:06.695
Kids from all over Arlen take
cotillion classes.

03:06.687 --> 03:09.987
It'll give me a chance
to meet new girls.

03:09.981 --> 03:12.154
If this is just an elaborate way

03:12.150 --> 03:14.994
for you to get to dress up
and parade around...

03:14.986 --> 03:16.533
I'm not going
to lie to you, Dad.

03:16.530 --> 03:18.783
I am going to love it!

03:18.782 --> 03:21.376
But this girl problem is real.

03:21.368 --> 03:25.123
Well, your handshake
could use a firmer grip,

03:25.122 --> 03:27.124
and a faster upswing.

03:27.124 --> 03:28.592
Thanks, Dad!

03:31.378 --> 03:33.096
Yee-ah!

03:40.095 --> 03:43.099
Wow! A whole new
crop of girls.

03:43.098 --> 03:44.771
And not one of them has seen my

03:44.766 --> 03:47.736
"flatulent monkey visits
the post office" routine.

03:47.728 --> 03:48.980
You know, Bobby,

03:48.979 --> 03:51.152
I think the drunks say it best.

03:51.148 --> 03:54.869
Sometimes you have to accept
the things you cannot change.

03:54.860 --> 03:57.033
Sure, you used to be
up on things,

03:57.028 --> 03:59.247
and maybe those days
are behind you,

03:59.239 --> 04:02.163
but you still have value.

04:02.159 --> 04:03.251
Huh?

04:05.036 --> 04:08.540
Hun Chin Ko.
Hun Chin Ko!

04:10.959 --> 04:13.087
She can't wait to get started.

04:21.553 --> 04:23.931
Rafters.

04:23.930 --> 04:25.352
What can I get for you today?

04:25.348 --> 04:29.353
Uh, I think I'll try
the meat loaf sandwich.

04:29.352 --> 04:31.150
You think or are you sure?

04:31.146 --> 04:33.524
'Cause once I enter it in,
they start making it.

04:33.523 --> 04:36.868
Yes, one meat loaf
sandwich, please.

04:42.324 --> 04:46.374
Uh, what's the procedure
to get a table?

04:46.369 --> 04:49.122
Well, you just sit wherever
there's an open chair.

04:49.122 --> 04:51.966
We're not "shee-shee"
here, it's a barn.

04:51.958 --> 04:54.882
Oh, oh, there's, uh,
room at the big table.

04:56.922 --> 04:59.050
Uh, I, I-I don't think
you understand.

04:59.216 --> 05:01.310
See, I'm not with those people.

05:01.301 --> 05:03.850
No one's a stranger
at the Arlen Barn!

05:12.354 --> 05:13.822
Oh, did you hear?

05:13.814 --> 05:15.691
With the new birth
control pills,

05:15.690 --> 05:18.910
you only have to have
one period a year.

05:18.902 --> 05:20.449
That's good, 'cause that patch

05:20.445 --> 05:22.823
makes my boobs really sensitive.

05:26.743 --> 05:29.462
Hm.

05:29.454 --> 05:32.128
Mmm...
How is it?

05:32.123 --> 05:33.591
Well, let me put it this way.

05:33.583 --> 05:36.006
This table smells like a diaper,

05:36.002 --> 05:39.472
and this is still the best meal
I've had in years.

05:42.509 --> 05:44.978
She loves chips.

05:51.560 --> 05:53.153
Anyone have an aspirin?

05:53.144 --> 05:54.487
All this clinking.

05:54.479 --> 05:55.901
You know, for a while now,

05:55.897 --> 05:58.525
there's been something
in the bottom of my purse.

05:58.525 --> 06:00.368
It's either an aspirin
or a breath mint.

06:00.360 --> 06:03.159
Here it is... it's covered
in lint, but you can have it.

06:03.154 --> 06:04.326
I have some French aspirin.

06:04.322 --> 06:05.539
It's amazing.

06:05.532 --> 06:07.205
Cute!

06:07.200 --> 06:08.793
Where did you get that?

06:08.785 --> 06:11.129
This thing?
It was in the gift bag backstage

06:11.121 --> 06:12.839
at the Gwen Stefani concert.

06:12.831 --> 06:13.957
There's separate compartments

06:13.957 --> 06:16.130
for Eastern
and Western remedies.

06:16.126 --> 06:17.423
Gwen thought of everything.

06:17.419 --> 06:18.762
Ooh! Really? Wow!

06:18.753 --> 06:19.970
Oh, I don't know her.

06:19.963 --> 06:21.340
I had to take
my daughter Michael.

06:21.339 --> 06:24.309
Oh, I think you meant
your son Michael.

06:24.301 --> 06:25.518
You just said daughter.

06:25.510 --> 06:27.103
I-I think you meant son.

06:29.639 --> 06:30.606
Oh.

06:32.142 --> 06:34.144
Your bag is delicious!

06:34.144 --> 06:36.112
I've been looking
for one just like it.

06:36.104 --> 06:37.526
I know, right?

06:37.522 --> 06:39.991
It's made out of vintage
Star Wars bedsheets.

06:39.983 --> 06:41.155
My friend makes these.

06:41.151 --> 06:42.323
Well, she did,

06:42.319 --> 06:44.492
before she got cast
on <i>Saturday Night Live.</i>

06:44.487 --> 06:46.615
Wow.

06:47.949 --> 06:50.168
And that is the proper way

06:50.160 --> 06:52.128
to remove a lady's coat.

06:52.120 --> 06:53.417
Do not yank!

06:55.790 --> 06:57.007
Whew!

06:57.000 --> 06:58.547
Here we go.

06:58.543 --> 07:00.966
May I take your coat, miss?

07:00.962 --> 07:02.714
Eye contact!

07:02.714 --> 07:03.966
Yes, you may.

07:03.965 --> 07:06.889
Do not yank!

07:08.637 --> 07:10.139
Introductions!

07:10.138 --> 07:11.105
I'm Michael.

07:11.264 --> 07:13.892
What if I told you
my name was Amanda?

07:13.892 --> 07:16.145
It's not.
It's Bobby.

07:16.144 --> 07:17.942
You're funny.

07:17.938 --> 07:19.155
That's major.

07:19.147 --> 07:20.569
"Major"?

07:20.565 --> 07:22.363
Sorry, they use it in Britain.

07:22.359 --> 07:24.361
It means, you know, "cool."

07:24.361 --> 07:26.159
Like perfume that
smells like dirt

07:26.154 --> 07:27.952
or numbers used as letters.

07:29.407 --> 07:33.128
Sure it's snake poison,
but it lasts longer than Botox.

07:33.119 --> 07:35.713
Judging by
how long it took them

07:35.705 --> 07:37.628
to learn how to eat soup,
this junkhausen

07:37.624 --> 07:39.877
could go on forever.

07:39.876 --> 07:42.174
Who wants to go to this new wine
bar a block over?

07:43.797 --> 07:45.094
Oh, that sounds great.

07:45.256 --> 07:48.135
There is nothing like
an afternoon Chardonnay.

07:48.134 --> 07:51.058
Uh... I'm not sure
if they still have that.

07:51.054 --> 07:54.149
They've got mostly Gruner
Veltliner and Spanish Duero.

07:54.140 --> 07:55.562
Oh, well, whatever.

07:55.558 --> 07:58.152
Pour it in a glass and throw
an ice cube and I'm happy.

07:59.312 --> 08:00.438
You're fun.

08:00.438 --> 08:01.610
You say what you think,

08:01.606 --> 08:02.858
like you're already drinking.

08:05.986 --> 08:07.158
Now, I got
to warn you...

08:07.153 --> 08:09.531
The DJ spins tons
of Danish prog rock,

08:09.531 --> 08:11.204
but usually it's stuff
you haven't heard.

08:11.199 --> 08:14.123
It seems like people who
already know about this place

08:14.119 --> 08:15.917
are the only ones
who could ever find it.

08:15.912 --> 08:18.665
Secrets are fun, huh, ladies?

08:18.665 --> 08:20.133
Yeah, about that.

08:20.125 --> 08:23.095
Can I get y'all to, um,
look away?

08:23.086 --> 08:25.384
It's also a secret
where the doorbell is.

08:35.265 --> 08:37.938
He's trained
to remove the uncool.

08:37.933 --> 08:39.150
I'm a goner.

08:39.144 --> 08:42.523
Okay, Peggy, reject them
before they reject you.

08:42.522 --> 08:44.365
Uh, I just saw my ex!

08:44.357 --> 08:45.654
I can't go in!

08:52.282 --> 08:54.284
We're in.

08:54.284 --> 08:55.911
You bet I'm in.

08:55.910 --> 08:58.504
And I am never leaving.

09:06.880 --> 09:08.553
Michael is the coolest girl.

09:08.548 --> 09:10.846
She uses words we know

09:10.842 --> 09:13.140
in ways that you'd never expect.

09:13.136 --> 09:14.604
And her mother Katt!

09:14.596 --> 09:16.098
She is so hip!

09:16.097 --> 09:19.146
She walks with this interesting
straight-legged saunter.

09:19.142 --> 09:20.985
I think I should start
doing that.

09:22.562 --> 09:23.814
Stop that.

09:23.813 --> 09:26.157
Your gait is fine the way it is.

09:26.149 --> 09:28.447
I want Michael to be
my girlfriend.

09:28.443 --> 09:30.992
And I want Katt
to be my girlfriend.

09:32.155 --> 09:33.873
Oh, I know it sounds silly,

09:33.865 --> 09:36.038
but I need a friend like
Katt right now.

09:36.034 --> 09:38.457
How great would it be
to have doors open for me

09:38.453 --> 09:41.627
and people ask me what <i>I</i> like,
so they know what to like.

09:41.623 --> 09:43.546
I would never be out
of the loop again.

09:43.541 --> 09:46.090
I'm excited for all of us!

09:49.506 --> 09:51.725
Hank, I'm honored
that you'd want

09:51.716 --> 09:53.389
to spend a weekend meal with us.

09:53.384 --> 09:55.057
Uh, no offense, Bill,

09:55.220 --> 09:57.939
but I just need you
guys as a buffer.

09:57.931 --> 09:59.353
The only table that's ever open

09:59.349 --> 10:02.148
is the big table, and I
want to be surrounded.

10:02.143 --> 10:04.111
Still honored.

10:05.355 --> 10:06.402
Go! Grab it!

10:09.400 --> 10:11.698
Thank God.

10:11.694 --> 10:13.446
That pregnant woman was fast,

10:13.446 --> 10:15.073
but we wanted it more.

10:17.158 --> 10:18.535
Your surname "Babcock"?

10:18.535 --> 10:20.879
No, it's Dauterive.

10:20.870 --> 10:22.588
Huh. You look like
you're a kin

10:22.580 --> 10:23.877
of the Lubbock Babcocks.

10:23.873 --> 10:25.671
Tell me about them.

10:25.667 --> 10:27.044
Well, there's Johnnie Babcock.

10:27.210 --> 10:28.462
He's a racist.

10:28.461 --> 10:29.678
Then there's Donita.

10:29.671 --> 10:31.673
She works for
the water department.

10:33.133 --> 10:34.806
How was school
today, Ms....

10:34.801 --> 10:36.144
Good-bye.

10:36.136 --> 10:38.104
Hun Chin Ko, it's improper

10:38.263 --> 10:40.140
to say "good-bye"
unless the end

10:40.140 --> 10:43.110
of the conversation
is mutually reached.

10:43.268 --> 10:45.646
May we have
the next pair, please?

10:51.151 --> 10:52.698
Hey!

10:56.114 --> 10:58.412
Hello, this is Robert Hill

10:58.408 --> 11:00.706
calling for
Ms. Michael Savage.

11:00.702 --> 11:02.750
Is she available, please?

11:02.745 --> 11:04.998
You are speaking
to Ms. Savage.

11:04.998 --> 11:06.420
Hello, Mr. Hill.

11:06.416 --> 11:08.384
Oh, Mr. Hill is my father.

11:08.376 --> 11:10.504
My friends call me Bobby.

11:10.503 --> 11:13.552
You should call me Robert.

11:16.134 --> 11:18.762
I, I know we just
met the other day,

11:18.761 --> 11:21.139
but I feel like
I've known you forever.

11:21.139 --> 11:23.141
I bet in no time we will be

11:23.141 --> 11:26.145
completing each other's...

11:26.144 --> 11:27.316
Hi, again.

11:27.312 --> 11:28.689
I want to say Penny.

11:28.688 --> 11:30.110
Peggy.

11:30.106 --> 11:31.153
I must ask:

11:31.149 --> 11:33.902
What is a contemporary woman
like yourself

11:33.902 --> 11:35.700
doing in this class?

11:35.695 --> 11:37.789
I mean, cotillion
hasn't been cool for,

11:37.780 --> 11:39.157
you know, five years.

11:39.157 --> 11:40.374
I know.

11:40.366 --> 11:42.164
Cotillion isn't even retro.

11:42.160 --> 11:45.084
But Michael wants me to throw
her a fancy birthday party.

11:45.246 --> 11:47.624
So she's going to learn
grace and poise

11:47.624 --> 11:49.092
and all that "biz-naz."

11:49.083 --> 11:51.757
Really? You know who loves
birthday parties?

11:51.753 --> 11:53.096
My son Bobby.

11:53.254 --> 11:55.882
He pins the tail on the donkey
like a surgeon.

11:55.882 --> 11:57.134
We both do.

11:57.133 --> 11:59.977
You know, I still haven't
filled up my last table,

11:59.969 --> 12:02.017
and the invites are being
delivered tomorrow.

12:02.013 --> 12:04.107
I should totally invite
some of you guys.

12:10.480 --> 12:13.108
Hey, you know what
would make me happy?

12:13.274 --> 12:15.447
A meal at the Arlen Barn

12:15.443 --> 12:19.118
with my family strategically
placed around me.

12:19.113 --> 12:21.957
Now, I warn you,
people will try to talk to you,

12:21.950 --> 12:24.123
and that's fine,
just don't pull me in.

12:24.118 --> 12:25.836
We cannot go.
We're waiting to see

12:25.828 --> 12:27.125
if we scored an invite

12:27.121 --> 12:29.089
to the children's
party of the decade!

12:29.082 --> 12:30.129
;
Okay,

12:30.124 --> 12:31.876
Well, I guess I could just

12:31.876 --> 12:33.878
cover my ears with my hands,

12:33.878 --> 12:36.051
but then how would I...

12:36.047 --> 12:37.640
Headphones!

12:38.716 --> 12:41.139
Mom, we have to get invited.

12:41.135 --> 12:43.558
It... would be... the best!

12:43.554 --> 12:44.305
It's true!

12:44.305 --> 12:45.648
Oh, my God!
I know!

12:47.684 --> 12:49.857
You two have lost your minds.

12:56.150 --> 12:58.118
Oh, it's just some box.

13:00.363 --> 13:01.865
Wait a minute.

13:06.119 --> 13:07.462
Whoo!
Whoo!

13:07.453 --> 13:08.796
See, you are cool.

13:08.788 --> 13:11.587
Hey, let's go celebrate
with a sandwich, superstar!

13:11.582 --> 13:12.799
Oh, no.

13:12.792 --> 13:15.591
I have a long way
to go before I am cool.

13:15.586 --> 13:17.088
But I will get there.

13:19.799 --> 13:22.143
Now, Bobby, we have to find out

13:22.135 --> 13:25.685
what's "in," and
do/buy/read/hear/wear it.

13:25.680 --> 13:29.480
We have got to "ba-ring" it
to this party!

13:34.522 --> 13:35.523
Those are great.

13:35.523 --> 13:36.615
It's nice to see someone

13:36.607 --> 13:38.075
not want the clear frames.

13:38.067 --> 13:40.115
I can't tell you how many people
come in and get those.

13:40.278 --> 13:41.871
They're so trendy.
I mean...

13:41.863 --> 13:43.865
I'll take the clear frames!

13:43.865 --> 13:46.243
According to a gadgets blogger

13:46.242 --> 13:49.462
named "Quaalude,"
this is the "it" vacuum.

13:49.454 --> 13:50.797
Are you sure?

13:50.788 --> 13:52.961
This one seems more space-agey.

13:52.957 --> 13:56.427
Oh, no. Seeing the dust
swirl around is so over.

13:58.713 --> 13:59.965
"Frittatas."

13:59.964 --> 14:01.136
Nope.
Never tried them.

14:01.132 --> 14:03.476
Bill, the question is
not if you have

14:03.468 --> 14:06.392
tried them or not,
just if you have heard of them.

14:06.387 --> 14:07.388
Sure, I've heard of them.

14:09.265 --> 14:10.107
"Cuddle parties."

14:10.266 --> 14:11.734
No.
Dang 'al nope.

14:11.726 --> 14:12.978
I have never heard of those.

14:14.771 --> 14:16.114
"Julia Roberts' niece."

14:16.272 --> 14:19.071
Nuh-uh. Does she also laugh
when she's startled?

14:19.067 --> 14:20.364
This is asinine.

14:20.360 --> 14:22.613
Don't you think people should
like you for yourself,

14:22.612 --> 14:25.161
and not because you know
all this nonsense?

14:25.156 --> 14:27.158
I cannot be myself, Hank.

14:27.158 --> 14:29.456
I like socks and Chardonnay.

14:32.121 --> 14:33.964
Son, son, your
pants are falling down.

14:33.956 --> 14:34.957
Here, I'll cover you.

14:36.834 --> 14:38.632
This is the style, Dad.

14:38.628 --> 14:41.472
Don't worry, I'm wearing
two pairs of underwear.

14:41.464 --> 14:44.968
Think of this outer underwear
as part of the pants.

14:44.967 --> 14:46.514
How about you wear pants

14:46.511 --> 14:49.060
and I'll think
about them as pants?

14:49.055 --> 14:51.683
Bobby, we are ready
for this party.

14:51.682 --> 14:54.606
I've even invented a word
for how ready we are.

14:54.602 --> 14:56.696
We're "rizzidy."

15:03.444 --> 15:05.742
This is so exciting!

15:05.738 --> 15:07.160
This'll be the first time

15:07.156 --> 15:10.126
I've ever seen
Michael's bare hands!

15:10.118 --> 15:13.713
And I am just four marble
stepping stones away

15:13.704 --> 15:15.547
from being Katt's BFF.

15:15.540 --> 15:18.089
That is "a friend
one is very loyal to."

15:19.877 --> 15:21.129
Ladies and gentlemen,

15:21.129 --> 15:23.131
making her grand entrance,

15:23.131 --> 15:27.102
the birthday girl,
Michael Savage!

15:28.386 --> 15:29.683
Hills in the crib!

15:29.679 --> 15:31.352
Aw, yeah!

15:31.347 --> 15:33.065
Heavens!

15:43.067 --> 15:46.162
Aah! My party is ruined!

15:46.154 --> 15:47.872
My life is over!

15:47.864 --> 15:50.037
Michael! Come back here!

16:01.127 --> 16:03.471
Oh, this is so awful.

16:03.463 --> 16:05.431
Maybe nobody noticed.

16:06.549 --> 16:09.098
Erase them!
Erase them!

16:09.093 --> 16:10.140
Violet!
Cayden!

16:10.136 --> 16:11.809
Check everybody's cell phone.

16:15.808 --> 16:18.152
Oh, Katt, I am so sorry.

16:18.144 --> 16:21.148
I thought this was
the appropriate attire.

16:21.147 --> 16:24.071
Look, I know you didn't mean
to show up and wreck

16:24.066 --> 16:26.114
everything I worked
ten months for.

16:26.277 --> 16:28.154
Honestly, if it wasn't this,

16:28.154 --> 16:30.248
she'd freak out
about something else.

16:30.239 --> 16:33.209
Still, I... I regret
that we were the cause

16:33.201 --> 16:34.418
of her freak out.

16:34.410 --> 16:35.957
And there she goes.

16:35.953 --> 16:38.923
I got to go coax Michael down
from the tree house again.

16:40.666 --> 16:43.385
Y'all way ruined
Michael's party!

16:44.670 --> 16:46.047
This was supposed to be

16:46.047 --> 16:48.049
the sickest party in the world!

16:48.216 --> 16:49.968
If this is a joke,

16:49.967 --> 16:52.095
it isn't funny, like, at all!

16:52.261 --> 16:54.355
It is totally obstructive!

17:01.145 --> 17:02.397
I'd like to order

17:02.396 --> 17:04.773
a meat loaf sandwich, please.

17:04.773 --> 17:06.151
That won't be necessary.

17:06.150 --> 17:07.992
I'd like it to go.

17:07.984 --> 17:09.487
Sure. If you'll
just have a seat,

17:09.487 --> 17:11.114
we'll bring it right out to you.

17:16.117 --> 17:18.212
Never mind.

17:21.915 --> 17:23.964
We have got to get out of here.

17:23.960 --> 17:25.803
I have never been
that humiliated

17:25.795 --> 17:27.468
in front of that many people.

17:27.463 --> 17:29.056
I definitely have.

17:29.048 --> 17:31.676
But still, that was pretty bad.

17:32.843 --> 17:34.140
Someone's coming!

17:34.136 --> 17:35.934
Quick! In here.

17:38.057 --> 17:39.559
I don't hate Kendice,

17:39.559 --> 17:42.233
I'm just saying her
mother's a belly dancer.

17:44.105 --> 17:46.233
Whew!

17:50.152 --> 17:51.119
Oh, my God.

17:51.279 --> 17:53.156
What is this place?

17:53.155 --> 17:56.455
It looks like the lair
of a crazy human

17:56.450 --> 17:58.748
or a smart animal.

17:58.744 --> 17:59.961
I know, right?

17:59.954 --> 18:01.001
Aah!
Oh, Lord!

18:00.997 --> 18:02.749
Oh, I swear,
we were not snooping,

18:02.748 --> 18:05.092
we, we were just trying
to find a way out.

18:06.794 --> 18:09.092
I never wanted anyone
to see this.

18:09.088 --> 18:11.136
I don't know, maybe I did,

18:11.132 --> 18:12.884
since I didn't keep it locked
or anything.

18:12.883 --> 18:15.762
You're not going
to lock it now, are you?

18:15.761 --> 18:18.139
Ah, being as cutting edge
as I am,

18:18.139 --> 18:20.608
it's a full-time job.
Seriously.

18:20.600 --> 18:23.570
I wake up when it's still dark
to watch the European news.

18:23.561 --> 18:25.404
Then I check in
with the club kids

18:25.396 --> 18:26.648
just before they go to bed.

18:26.647 --> 18:30.151
I read 142 blogs a day,
every day, every hour.

18:30.151 --> 18:32.370
And look at me,
I'm texting right now.

18:32.361 --> 18:34.580
Huh. Wristbands are out.

18:34.572 --> 18:37.166
Sure, all of this seems crazy.

18:37.158 --> 18:40.128
But I don't know, I guess that's
the price you pay for glamour.

18:40.119 --> 18:42.372
I mean, look at this bag.

18:42.371 --> 18:44.373
Mm, that's an Uchi Tomagoi.

18:44.373 --> 18:46.125
It's not coming out
for three months.

18:46.125 --> 18:47.126
I believe it.

18:47.126 --> 18:48.924
It looks like
it's from the future.

18:48.919 --> 18:50.296
I want this bag,

18:50.296 --> 18:52.594
that collage, your life!

18:52.590 --> 18:54.513
Trust me, you don't.

18:54.508 --> 18:57.136
See, I follow trends.

18:57.136 --> 18:58.763
All of them,
no matter what...

18:58.763 --> 19:00.140
Piercings, colonies,

19:00.139 --> 19:02.392
trendy surgeries,
online affairs.

19:02.391 --> 19:04.143
I've even done some
street fighting.

19:04.143 --> 19:06.441
You think Katt Savage
is my real name?

19:06.437 --> 19:07.484
It's not.

19:07.480 --> 19:08.777
It's Barb Davis.

19:12.276 --> 19:13.778
And now...

19:13.778 --> 19:14.995
I'm free.

19:18.157 --> 19:19.909
I-I do not understand.

19:19.909 --> 19:22.503
I knew I was drawn to you
for a reason.

19:22.495 --> 19:24.122
I must've had
a subconscious need

19:24.121 --> 19:26.044
to break away from all this.

19:26.040 --> 19:29.044
Oh... so, I am so "uncool,"

19:29.043 --> 19:31.091
I snapped you
out of your hip trance?

19:31.253 --> 19:33.096
Exactly.

19:33.255 --> 19:36.099
Peggy, you aren't
driven by trends

19:36.092 --> 19:38.515
or fashion or snarky Web sites.

19:38.511 --> 19:40.104
You don't need to be.

19:40.262 --> 19:42.560
You are your own person.

19:42.556 --> 19:44.479
And I think that's way cool.

19:46.644 --> 19:49.363
Well, come
to think of it, so do I.

19:49.355 --> 19:52.529
So, what are regular people
into these days?

19:52.525 --> 19:54.744
For starters,
we buy all our makeup

19:54.735 --> 19:56.032
at the grocery store.

19:57.905 --> 19:59.452
What about me and Michael?

19:59.448 --> 20:01.450
Are we, uh...?

20:04.120 --> 20:05.212
We are not.

20:06.872 --> 20:08.966
I had a nightmare
I was being chaste.

20:08.958 --> 20:10.801
Who was chasing you?

20:10.793 --> 20:11.919
No "chaste."

20:11.919 --> 20:14.138
As in "no intercourse."
It was horrible.

20:14.130 --> 20:15.632
What's "intercourse"?

20:15.631 --> 20:17.133
Is that like a car race?

20:23.055 --> 20:24.648
Hill residence.

20:24.640 --> 20:27.109
May I speak
to "Mr. Robert Hill?"

20:27.268 --> 20:28.861
This is he.

20:28.853 --> 20:32.153
"I am calling
because I would like

20:32.148 --> 20:33.866
to ask you out on a date."

20:33.858 --> 20:35.656
Yes!

20:35.651 --> 20:38.120
May I ask who's calling?

20:43.784 --> 20:45.752
It's done.

20:47.913 --> 20:49.130
Ah! Great.

20:49.123 --> 20:50.090
Money first.

20:58.132 --> 20:59.475
What the...?

20:59.467 --> 21:00.764
Uh, they gave it to me

21:00.760 --> 21:02.854
and it had a bite
out of it, you know.

21:12.146 --> 21:15.741
Mmm-mm-mm!

21:53.229 --> 21:56.199
Do not yank!

21:59.500 --> 22:07.500
