WEBVTT

00:04.433 --> 00:07.867
We're trying to look for
a better way to get up
to Nugget creek.

00:10.734 --> 00:12.500
I don't have a way in
right now.

00:14.400 --> 00:18.467
The water is getting too deep
for the army truck to
make it through.

00:18.467 --> 00:20.634
It's gonna be deep,
but it's not as deep as this.

00:22.500 --> 00:26.667
Can't take a helicopter
'cause fuel and cost are
just outrageous.

00:27.533 --> 00:29.700
$2,400 an hour?

00:30.767 --> 00:32.066
Thank that was our last trip.

00:33.734 --> 00:35.934
Right now, I'm running out
of options.

00:39.033 --> 00:41.634
Either way, I'm gonna learn
to drive an airboat today.

00:44.433 --> 00:46.033
Everybody keeps telling me
I'm gonna die,

00:47.433 --> 00:49.734
just because I've never
actually driven one before.

00:51.433 --> 00:52.467
Here goes nothing.

00:53.834 --> 00:55.934
- Whoo-wee. Holy money, dude.
- Whoo!

00:55.934 --> 00:57.433
That's what I'm talking about,
right here.

00:59.700 --> 01:00.767
It's on loan,

01:00.767 --> 01:03.700
and if this work for us,
this could be the answer

01:03.700 --> 01:06.233
to us getting to and from
the dig site.

01:07.500 --> 01:08.333
All right.

01:09.100 --> 01:09.900
You ready?

01:10.600 --> 01:12.333
- Yeah!
- Here we go.

01:13.233 --> 01:14.800
An old timer
once told me,

01:14.800 --> 01:17.000
airboats up the
Syracuse is deadly.

01:18.300 --> 01:19.934
Well, I don't know.

01:19.934 --> 01:21.867
I think once we learn
how to drive it,
it might be all right.

01:22.634 --> 01:24.367
Sink or swim.

01:24.367 --> 01:26.900
This is not a test
of how to drive up a river.

01:26.900 --> 01:29.066
I need to find out how
this boat drives.

01:33.834 --> 01:37.667
It's almost like you're taking
your dad's car out
the first time

01:37.667 --> 01:40.066
in the parking lot, you know?

01:40.066 --> 01:42.967
It's about time
I learn how to drive
one of these things.

01:42.967 --> 01:44.967
You know what I'm most
worried about?

01:44.967 --> 01:47.266
You can't let off the gas
in the corner
'cause you won't turn.

01:47.266 --> 01:49.200
- Yeah.
- Zero power, zero steering.

01:49.200 --> 01:51.233
That's what you
gotta remember.

01:51.233 --> 01:52.433
So, y'all,
I'm a little nervous.

01:52.433 --> 01:54.634
So, let's just do this before
I lose my nerve.

02:02.433 --> 02:03.600
Oh, man.

02:10.500 --> 02:13.333
- Whoo-hoo-hoo! Yeah!
- Yeah!

02:13.333 --> 02:14.533
Yeah!

02:17.634 --> 02:18.834
Holy moly.

02:20.433 --> 02:24.967
Damn.
I don't think it likes, these.

02:24.967 --> 02:27.500
That's not on top of water
as much as I thought
it would be.

02:30.500 --> 02:34.200
No, no, no, no! No!

02:34.200 --> 02:36.634
- Do you see that?
It was dipping into the water.
- But... I know.

02:37.500 --> 02:38.967
I can't believe I just
did that.

02:45.367 --> 02:49.233
It's way harder than
I thought it was gonna be.

02:49.233 --> 02:51.333
It didn't play like
I thought it was going to.

02:51.333 --> 02:55.767
All right. That did not
instill confidence into me
at all.

02:55.767 --> 02:57.367
No, I agree. 100 percent.

02:57.367 --> 02:59.533
With the nose diving in like
that, it'll be treacherous.

03:00.500 --> 03:01.967
As it's running
right now,

03:01.967 --> 03:06.467
I think it's impossible for me
to bring an entire crew
of people

03:06.467 --> 03:08.767
up the river
without killing everybody.

03:13.900 --> 03:14.767
Here we go.

03:14.767 --> 03:16.166
Yeah, James!

03:16.166 --> 03:17.467
There's a will,
there's a way.

03:17.467 --> 03:20.100
Damn it.

03:20.100 --> 03:22.100
I got hit really hard, man.

03:24.867 --> 03:26.734
That's a grand entrance.

03:26.734 --> 03:29.567
Yee-hoo! [bleep] damn,
I made it!

03:32.233 --> 03:35.233
Bubbles, the Dozer,
might be a little crazy,

03:35.233 --> 03:38.634
but I'm pretty sure I heard
Bubbles say, "I love Dustin."

03:38.634 --> 03:42.200
All the experience in the past
is going to come to bear
right now.

03:45.433 --> 03:47.467
I think this
too dangerous.

03:47.467 --> 03:49.834
- Holy [bleep].
- That's a damn good sign.

03:49.834 --> 03:52.266
Hey! Hey!

03:52.266 --> 03:56.300
- Oh, look at that!
- Dustin! I've got some
gold, man!

04:09.033 --> 04:11.266
Nugget Creek
turned out to be,

04:11.266 --> 04:13.166
well, a lot damn harder
than I thought.

04:14.767 --> 04:17.100
In the wilds
of Southeast Alaska,

04:17.100 --> 04:20.433
Dustin Hurt is gambling
his entire life savings

04:20.433 --> 04:23.567
on a new and remote claim.

04:23.567 --> 04:27.100
Did not expect
a whole bunch of snow
to still be there.

04:27.100 --> 04:29.700
More than we expected.

04:29.700 --> 04:32.600
Two weeks ago,
Dustin moved his operation

04:32.600 --> 04:34.634
deep into
the chill-capped mountains

04:36.066 --> 04:40.066
in search of a monster payday
the old timers couldn't reach.

04:40.066 --> 04:42.200
I know there's much larger
gold here.

04:42.200 --> 04:45.367
It seems like McKinley
on steroids.

04:45.367 --> 04:50.567
But he was blocked
by a 20-foot deep wall of ice

04:50.567 --> 04:52.634
that covers the entire creek.

04:52.634 --> 04:53.967
It's under that ice!

04:54.934 --> 04:56.734
It's solid snow up there now.

04:56.734 --> 04:58.834
That's a lot of snow!

04:58.834 --> 05:01.900
But nothing he did
would melt it.

05:01.900 --> 05:04.333
Right now, it feels like this
place is out of my league.

05:09.367 --> 05:12.467
We definitely can't dig
at our spot yet because of
all the snow.

05:12.467 --> 05:14.033
We can't do that.

05:14.033 --> 05:17.066
Nugget Creek's looking
real rough, but I'm not giving
up on it.

05:17.066 --> 05:19.700
Be really nice to see some
gold in the meantime, though.

05:20.700 --> 05:22.734
While we're working on
the snow melting,

05:22.734 --> 05:26.100
Mark said that he wanted
a dredge crew.

05:26.100 --> 05:30.500
But I don't know exactly what
he wants us to do yet.

05:30.500 --> 05:32.734
To keep his
operation running,

05:32.734 --> 05:36.200
Dustin must find a way
to make some money.

05:36.200 --> 05:38.600
Every time I see you,
I'm looking for something...

05:38.600 --> 05:40.433
...in my doggone
shed here.

05:41.266 --> 05:42.767
How are things going
in your world?

05:43.967 --> 05:45.600
At the start of
this season,

05:45.600 --> 05:50.834
legendary miner, Mark Sebens,
offered Dustin an opportunity.

05:50.834 --> 05:53.800
You had mentioned
there was something here
that maybe we could dig.

05:53.800 --> 05:55.700
Oh, well yeah, come on.
You wanna take a walk?

05:55.700 --> 05:57.000
Sounds great, man.

06:02.367 --> 06:04.200
So, here's what we got.

06:04.200 --> 06:08.233
The flume was 30-feet wide,
eight feet tall,

06:08.233 --> 06:10.166
sitting on pilings, and...

06:10.166 --> 06:13.367
they took all of that creek,
ran it through the flume.

06:15.266 --> 06:16.934
100 years ago,

06:16.934 --> 06:20.166
old timers built a massive
wooden flume

06:20.166 --> 06:22.433
to divert Porcupine Creek,

06:22.433 --> 06:27.200
so they could mine
the riverbed for thousands
of ounces of gold.

06:27.200 --> 06:31.266
Mark believed the miners
couldn't dig beneath
the flume.

06:31.266 --> 06:34.300
So, the area around
the pilings could contain

06:34.300 --> 06:37.300
the massive payday
Dustin desperately needs.

06:40.567 --> 06:44.000
Last season, Mark started
excavating this ground.

06:45.033 --> 06:48.834
So, like, it could be
for a small support.

06:48.834 --> 06:52.600
But the pit
constantly fills with
creek water,

06:52.600 --> 06:55.000
stopping him from reaching
bedrock gold.

07:00.967 --> 07:03.533
I know that I can get
a decent amount of
the material

07:03.533 --> 07:04.900
with the excavator.

07:04.900 --> 07:07.600
But I also just know that
I could be leaving...

07:08.934 --> 07:11.000
- ounces and ounces of gold
on the bottom.
- Yeah.

07:11.934 --> 07:13.533
Do you have any
experienced dredgers?

07:13.533 --> 07:17.200
Oh, believe me,
we definitely have
experienced dredgers.

07:17.200 --> 07:18.900
Maybe we could make
a deal here.

07:20.066 --> 07:21.266
So, are you interested
in this?

07:21.266 --> 07:23.467
Because it would be you
and your crew out here.

07:23.467 --> 07:25.233
It's better than just
sitting around,

07:25.233 --> 07:28.200
- waiting for the snow to
melt at Nugget Creek.
- Yeah.

07:28.200 --> 07:30.834
What do you think about
the idea of like, 20 percent?

07:33.300 --> 07:35.500
- Just throwing it out there.
- Um...

07:37.700 --> 07:39.100
It seems a little low.

07:40.867 --> 07:42.934
We meet at like,
25 or something,

07:42.934 --> 07:44.734
it might be a little
more worthwhile.

07:46.000 --> 07:47.400
Okay, let me think about this.

07:48.333 --> 07:49.800
You know, what are my
other options?

07:52.266 --> 07:55.400
I'd like to be there
for the clean ups. Okay?

07:55.400 --> 07:57.867
- Of course, yeah. That's fair.
- You know?

07:58.667 --> 07:59.634
25.

08:01.734 --> 08:03.233
All right, Kayla.

08:03.233 --> 08:04.367
- Well, it sounds good to me,
if that works for you.
- Sounds good.

08:05.066 --> 08:06.734
All right.

08:06.734 --> 08:09.000
Mark and Kayla
came up with a deal.

08:10.166 --> 08:12.533
And if it's only a week
or two of work,

08:13.333 --> 08:15.834
25 percent of a lot of gold,

08:17.367 --> 08:18.667
that's a lot of payday.

08:28.066 --> 08:30.500
So, this is where
we're gonna be digging at.

08:32.734 --> 08:34.433
I see why the flume was here.

08:34.433 --> 08:37.600
Gives you a straight line
right down the creek.

08:37.600 --> 08:40.634
Those are some of
the timbers from
the old flume...

08:40.634 --> 08:41.967
- No [bleep].
- Yeah.

08:43.033 --> 08:45.367
Oh, wow. This is gonna
be awesome.

08:47.300 --> 08:49.433
Yeah, I thought it was gonna
be a lot smaller pond
than this.

08:49.433 --> 08:52.300
- This is actually huge.
- Yeah, it's good.

08:52.300 --> 08:54.500
He seems to think that
it's been untouched.

08:54.500 --> 08:58.533
So, if that's true, I mean,
there's potential for
really good gold here.

08:58.533 --> 09:01.900
Before Kayla sets
to dredge in the water,

09:01.900 --> 09:05.734
she samples the dry section
that was also under the flume.

09:07.333 --> 09:10.400
Trying to get that
seam where they
meet each other.

09:10.400 --> 09:13.367
And hopefully,
there'll be a little bit
of gold in the pan.

09:15.300 --> 09:17.133
I'd like to see several flakes

09:18.100 --> 09:19.800
in a pan to consider it good.

09:19.800 --> 09:22.200
If I just see one
or two specks,

09:22.200 --> 09:24.100
I don't really get
excited over that.

09:24.734 --> 09:25.734
We good?

09:27.667 --> 09:31.000
Ah, no way.
Holy, [bleep]!

09:31.000 --> 09:33.800
Holy [bleep]!

09:33.800 --> 09:37.467
Do you realize that last year,
it was,

09:38.700 --> 09:41.467
what, two months later than
it is right now,

09:41.467 --> 09:44.033
before we saw gold like that.

09:44.033 --> 09:46.900
Well, I mean, that
gives us a good idea of what

09:46.900 --> 09:49.533
- could possibly be on
the bedrock there.
- Yeah!

09:49.533 --> 09:52.567
Yep, that's a damn
good sign.

09:52.567 --> 09:55.700
Seeing that in
the test pan, I got a feeling
that when we run a full day,

09:55.700 --> 09:57.233
there should be some pretty
good gold in the box.

09:57.233 --> 10:00.400
- This is gonna be fun.
- This is exciting. This is
gonna be [bleep] sweet.

10:00.400 --> 10:03.533
Damn, now I'm ready
to get the dredge together
and get in the water.

10:03.533 --> 10:07.567
As Kayla crew
prepares for the first time
of this season,

10:07.567 --> 10:10.700
nine miles south,
at Nugget Creek,

10:10.700 --> 10:13.467
Dustin has a big problem.

10:13.467 --> 10:16.066
...there better be
a lot of gold here.

10:16.066 --> 10:18.867
The only safe way
to access his claim,

10:18.867 --> 10:21.000
is completely unsustainable.

10:23.333 --> 10:26.133
Just that flight here
cost us $1,200.

10:26.767 --> 10:28.233
Gotta make some changes.

10:28.233 --> 10:30.634
Gotta take some risk 'cause

10:30.634 --> 10:32.266
this isn't gonna
work out anymore.

10:33.266 --> 10:34.934
Just not gonna work.

10:34.934 --> 10:38.300
After nearly
killing himself trailing
an airboat,

10:38.300 --> 10:40.634
Dustin has an ambitious
Plan B.

10:45.266 --> 10:47.500
We have to get a way
in and out of here.

10:47.500 --> 10:51.767
So, next step is,
I gotta build an airstrip.

10:51.767 --> 10:55.800
To stand any chance
of running an effective
mining operation,

10:55.800 --> 10:59.100
Dustin needs a supply line
for equipment and crew.

11:00.600 --> 11:01.700
Yeah!

11:06.400 --> 11:07.400
Little sketchy.

11:09.233 --> 11:12.400
Right now, we're looking for
an area for a runway.

11:12.400 --> 11:16.834
There's this hill right here,
and I cannot get up on top
of it,

11:16.834 --> 11:19.367
but that's where we wanna be.

11:19.367 --> 11:22.066
And all the maps say
there is the best spot.

11:24.333 --> 11:26.367
Dustin and his
D-4 dozer

11:26.367 --> 11:29.500
face dense vegetation
in the hunt for an airstrip.

11:30.433 --> 11:32.100
[bleep] ...

11:33.500 --> 11:35.200
Do you see another way?

11:35.200 --> 11:38.000
I can try to do some hiking
and see what I can find.

11:39.333 --> 11:40.934
- All the way out that way?
- Yeah.

11:42.667 --> 11:45.967
Wes scouts ahead
for suitable ground.

11:45.967 --> 11:48.533
Well, I wish I had
a freaking machete.

11:48.533 --> 11:52.634
A flat area,
at least 200 by 1000 feet.

11:53.800 --> 11:56.000
At this rate,
we keep going like this,

11:56.000 --> 11:58.967
we're gonna have to find
ten times as much gold as
we have in the past

11:58.967 --> 12:00.834
just to cover our expense
to get out here.

12:02.734 --> 12:03.900
Holy [bleep]!

12:07.000 --> 12:08.100
Short alders,

12:09.600 --> 12:12.066
probably a mile
of clearing there.

12:12.066 --> 12:13.767
It couldn't be any better
than this.

12:13.767 --> 12:16.166
This is a perfect place
for our new runway.

12:19.734 --> 12:21.700
It looks good up here.

12:21.700 --> 12:23.266
If you could just
get here, yeah.

12:24.433 --> 12:26.000
I may not make it
up there.

12:27.200 --> 12:29.100
But I'm gonna [bleep] try.

12:32.066 --> 12:32.934
Come on, baby.

12:38.166 --> 12:39.166
You can make it.

12:42.867 --> 12:44.367
They have tracks.

12:45.867 --> 12:47.133
That dozer is a beast.

12:52.133 --> 12:54.200
I got hit really hard, man.

12:54.934 --> 12:57.667
Yeah.

12:58.767 --> 13:01.500
Some of these plants is just
trying to take me out.

13:03.066 --> 13:05.033
Got a little loopy there
for a little while.

13:06.767 --> 13:11.266
, yeah!

13:11.266 --> 13:12.834
Yeah!

13:12.834 --> 13:15.800
I found the perfect
way! Yeah!

13:16.967 --> 13:18.734
This is awesome up here.

13:21.000 --> 13:24.600
Dude, we found it.
We're here.

13:26.200 --> 13:29.433
- So, you think we can get
a 1000 feet out of this?
- Yep.

13:29.433 --> 13:32.033
- Oh, wow. It just
keeps going, huh?
- Yeah, look right here.

13:33.300 --> 13:35.467
- How beautiful is that?
- Oh, that is nice.

13:35.467 --> 13:38.634
There's only like,
that tree there,
couple of them on the side.

13:39.533 --> 13:41.033
I think we should
do this.

13:41.033 --> 13:43.734
- Let me get on it and let's
just start tearing it up.
- Yeah.

13:46.700 --> 13:48.433
Whoo-hoo!

13:48.433 --> 13:51.567
I know it's a lot of work
but I think it's gonna be
worth it.

13:52.734 --> 13:56.333
The hell do I know about
landing an airplane?

13:56.333 --> 13:58.700
I mean, it's good,
but I guess it's supposed
to be flat.

13:58.700 --> 14:00.166
But I don't know how flat.

14:06.467 --> 14:08.166
Back at
Porcupine Creek...

14:08.166 --> 14:09.767
I need you to get
this dredge fired up,

14:09.767 --> 14:11.867
- I'm gonna go get dressed.
- Okay.

14:11.867 --> 14:14.867
After finding
the first nugget
of this season,

14:14.867 --> 14:20.533
Kayla has high hopes for
a huge deposit at the bottom
of the pilings pond.

14:20.533 --> 14:22.500
We've been here for
so long without dredging.

14:22.500 --> 14:26.433
I'm excited to get
in the water and, hopefully,
see some gold today.

14:27.333 --> 14:28.500
That would be ideal.

14:36.533 --> 14:37.967
How are you feeling
for your first dive?

14:38.867 --> 14:40.367
Hopefully, we'll see
some gold.

14:45.300 --> 14:48.900
Can you hear me, Kayla?
Loud and clear.

14:48.900 --> 14:49.934
Yep, loud and clear.

14:50.967 --> 14:51.767
There you go.

14:54.734 --> 14:56.233
Just be careful,
you're weighed down.

14:56.934 --> 14:57.900
Okay.

15:01.934 --> 15:03.200
Oh,
what the [bleep]?

15:04.467 --> 15:07.867
There's so much sludge
down here, it feels like

15:07.867 --> 15:10.467
when you're stuck in
a giant pile of dog [bleep].

15:10.467 --> 15:13.834
Like, the biggest pile of
dog [bleep] I've ever felt
in my life.

15:15.400 --> 15:17.900
Silt, made of
quartz and shale,

15:17.900 --> 15:21.100
gives the pond
near zero visibility.

15:21.100 --> 15:23.233
Can't even touch
a [bleep] thing.

15:27.867 --> 15:29.500
There's logs sticking out.

15:31.900 --> 15:37.066
There's [bleep] sticks
sticking out of the side
everywhere, to get tangled on.

15:37.066 --> 15:38.900
And if she gets
wrapped around,
it is gonna be hard

15:38.900 --> 15:40.000
to try to get her
out of there.

15:44.300 --> 15:46.900
[bleep] Damn it.

15:49.600 --> 15:52.667
My [bleep] stuck on something.

15:52.667 --> 15:54.266
Man, she's hung up
on something now.

15:54.266 --> 15:56.000
That's what I was
worried about.

15:56.000 --> 15:57.300
Can't see nothing.

15:58.700 --> 16:01.133
This is too dangerous.

16:01.133 --> 16:03.533
I think we need to figure out
a different way to do this.

16:13.300 --> 16:15.100
There's
sticks sticking out

16:15.100 --> 16:17.367
of the side everywhere,
to get tangled on.

16:18.367 --> 16:20.200
Man, she's hung up
on something now.

16:20.200 --> 16:21.233
I was worried about that.

16:22.200 --> 16:24.233
At
Porcupine Creek...

16:24.233 --> 16:27.500
I think this
is too dangerous.

16:27.500 --> 16:31.300
Kayla experiences
every diver's worst nightmare.

16:33.066 --> 16:36.266
Yeah, you can't see.
With your hand right here,
you can't even see.

16:38.967 --> 16:40.100
Coming up.

16:44.667 --> 16:45.867
You want your
mask off?

16:47.967 --> 16:51.400
- Even with white like this...
- ...you
can't see nothing.

16:52.000 --> 16:53.567
It goes black.

16:53.567 --> 16:56.100
I'm okay with
the low visibility,

16:56.100 --> 16:58.634
- but not when there's
to get tangled on.
- Exactly.

16:58.634 --> 17:01.667
I think we need to regroup.

17:08.934 --> 17:11.066
I'm the bulldozer...

17:11.066 --> 17:13.734
Across
the mountain,
at Nugget Creek...

17:13.734 --> 17:16.567
Plowing through the alders...

17:16.567 --> 17:19.500
...Dustin makes
headway on an airstrip,

17:19.500 --> 17:22.467
a vital supply line for
his mining operation.

17:25.033 --> 17:27.433
I'm a bulldozer!

17:28.066 --> 17:29.467
Here I come!

17:30.433 --> 17:33.066
His goal,
to build a runway

17:33.066 --> 17:36.834
to allow bush planes to bring
in essential mining supplies.

17:52.734 --> 17:54.734
The airstrip
is useless

17:54.734 --> 17:59.166
unless Dustin can unlock
Nugget Creek from the 20-foot
blanket of ice.

18:00.900 --> 18:02.200
Last week...

18:02.200 --> 18:05.400
- Hey, Fred.
- What's
going on?

18:05.400 --> 18:07.033
Having a whole bunch
of trouble.

18:07.033 --> 18:10.200
...Dustin reached
out to his father, Fred,
for a solution.

18:10.200 --> 18:11.700
Yeah, man.
I need some help.

18:13.266 --> 18:15.867
Now, Fred
races north,

18:15.867 --> 18:18.066
but he's sent ahead
a secret weapon

18:18.066 --> 18:20.333
to tackle the ice.

18:20.333 --> 18:23.900
Fred came up with
an idea to use a heater
to try to melt the ice.

18:24.800 --> 18:26.667
There it goes, right there.

18:26.667 --> 18:28.934
I guess it weighs almost
500 pounds,

18:28.934 --> 18:30.533
so we had to fly it up there.

18:36.600 --> 18:38.166
10-4.
Thanks, man.

18:45.600 --> 18:49.767
Fred's idea is to take this
and melt the snow with it.

18:50.533 --> 18:51.834
I think he's onto something.

18:53.800 --> 18:58.700
Fred's plan,
repurpose a diver
hot water system

18:58.700 --> 19:01.533
to melt the snow and ice
from above,

19:01.533 --> 19:05.066
clearing a path so they can
dive for bedrock gold.

19:09.433 --> 19:11.667
But all the gear they need
to run it

19:11.667 --> 19:14.100
is 500 feet down the creek.

19:15.667 --> 19:18.100
Without this
generator, we have no power.

19:18.100 --> 19:19.934
With no power,
we have no hot water.

19:19.934 --> 19:24.867
With no hot water, we still
have two football fields
of snow and ice

19:24.867 --> 19:26.667
between us and gold.

19:28.900 --> 19:31.033
To move
the 80 pound generator...

19:31.834 --> 19:33.500
There we go.

19:33.500 --> 19:37.634
...a portable
cap stand winch will be used
to pull the gear

19:37.634 --> 19:39.533
up the step bear trail.

19:42.233 --> 19:43.667
Mountain goat today.

19:46.033 --> 19:47.867
You have to do
in stages, man.

19:47.867 --> 19:50.400
And then, tie off
up there and go straight
from there.

19:50.400 --> 19:52.066
Yep. It's a good idea.

19:57.233 --> 19:58.433
Hopefully, this works.

19:58.433 --> 20:00.266
You know, this is a lot
of work and effort.

20:00.266 --> 20:02.700
It has to work.
All right, James?

20:02.700 --> 20:04.567
- There's a will,
there's a way.
- Sure.

20:06.000 --> 20:09.533
Come on, baby.
Give me some love.

20:16.033 --> 20:17.166
Ooh, here we go.

20:22.166 --> 20:23.967
You're good. It's working.

20:26.700 --> 20:27.700
Phew!

20:34.266 --> 20:35.700
Yeah, James!

20:41.533 --> 20:43.200
I just got a mouthful
of that lettuce.

20:45.600 --> 20:47.967
Yeah! This is just
the first part, man.

20:47.967 --> 20:51.734
We still have, like, a
marathon to go, dude.

20:51.734 --> 20:54.033
Now, from the top
of the hill,

20:54.033 --> 20:56.967
the cap stand is no use.

20:56.967 --> 21:00.467
Lowering the generator
is the toughest part
of the mission.

21:11.333 --> 21:13.734
I think, just with
the generator alone, right,

21:13.734 --> 21:15.667
- smaller and everything.
- Smaller, we can
maneuver easier

21:15.667 --> 21:17.400
- without tripping.
- Yeah.

21:17.400 --> 21:18.700
On three!

21:22.200 --> 21:24.600
We're literally
rappelling with a generator.

21:24.600 --> 21:26.834
Yeah! We're rappelling
with a generator, dude.

21:26.834 --> 21:29.000
Holy [bleep], man. Ha!

21:29.600 --> 21:31.367
Grab it. Whoo!

21:32.867 --> 21:35.200
Hey, fellas.
How's it going, man?

21:36.900 --> 21:38.800
You guys are getting
your ass kicked over here,
that's what it looks like.

21:38.800 --> 21:39.934
Pretty much.

21:41.166 --> 21:43.533
- You can set it
right there for a sec.
- All right.

21:43.533 --> 21:45.834
Good?

21:47.000 --> 21:47.967
Uh, grab that rope.

21:49.600 --> 21:51.300
Come with me.

21:54.900 --> 21:56.367
Slow down. Yep.

21:56.367 --> 21:57.300
Keep going.

21:58.533 --> 21:59.634
- Letting go.
- Yep.

22:00.634 --> 22:01.500
Atta boy.

22:03.233 --> 22:04.900
Ooh, well, we got it.

22:15.700 --> 22:17.166
So, this is it, huh?

22:18.200 --> 22:21.867
- This looks fancy, man.
- Yeah.

22:21.867 --> 22:25.300
Fred's hot
water heater is Dustin's
Hail Mary attempt

22:25.300 --> 22:28.433
to melt last season's snow.

22:28.433 --> 22:31.800
This is a Cadillac,
man, for hot water heaters.

22:31.800 --> 22:35.834
If it doesn't work,
they could be locked out
of Nugget Creek for good.

22:37.000 --> 22:39.433
Well, fellas, this looks too
complicated for me.

22:39.433 --> 22:40.800
- You guys gonna set this up?
- Yeah.

22:40.800 --> 22:43.567
I gotta get back
to my airstrip.

22:43.567 --> 22:45.266
You guys okay with me
leaving you with this?

22:45.266 --> 22:47.300
- Yeah.
- All right, guys,

22:47.300 --> 22:48.166
get it going, man.

22:50.734 --> 22:53.233
I got this nice
plastic water hose

22:53.233 --> 22:55.166
and I drilled holes
all through it,

22:55.166 --> 22:56.700
so it makes like,
a little sprinkler.

22:59.700 --> 23:01.533
There you go! Oh!

23:01.533 --> 23:04.200
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
That's perfect.

23:04.200 --> 23:05.867
- Is that where you want it?
- Yep.

23:07.200 --> 23:09.433
- That's pretty far.
- That is pretty far.

23:10.433 --> 23:11.900
We get warm water
going on that,

23:11.900 --> 23:14.266
that's gonna open up
a big hole, I think.

23:14.266 --> 23:15.300
Let's turn this
baby on.

23:17.166 --> 23:19.567
I just wanna make sure
we've got water coming out
of the...

23:20.166 --> 23:21.367
...this hose, here.

23:23.200 --> 23:25.700
We got water.
Lots of it.

23:26.967 --> 23:28.300
Look at that.

23:31.300 --> 23:34.233
That's [bleep] gonna
steam pretty good.

23:34.233 --> 23:36.166
We got water pressure.

23:36.166 --> 23:40.033
The question is, is it gonna
get enough heat to melt
the snow?

23:43.000 --> 23:46.300
As the hot water
sprinkler system is left to do
it's work,

23:48.066 --> 23:49.266
at the airstrip,

23:50.133 --> 23:52.233
the pressure is now on Dustin

23:52.233 --> 23:54.634
to open up the much needed
supply line

23:54.634 --> 23:55.734
for his operation.

23:57.567 --> 23:59.367
This stuff is awful.

24:00.934 --> 24:02.567
A couple alders aren't
a problem.

24:03.367 --> 24:05.133
Hundreds of thousands
of alders,

24:05.800 --> 24:07.667
that is the damn problem.

24:10.467 --> 24:11.433
Come on, baby.

24:16.300 --> 24:18.634
Whoo! Feeling crazy.

24:21.500 --> 24:23.734
Oh, ... light came back on.

24:23.734 --> 24:25.266
It didn't like that [bleep].

24:33.367 --> 24:34.166
What was that?

24:38.000 --> 24:39.600
I don't know what these mean.

24:39.600 --> 24:42.467
I know that one's oil. I don't
know what that one means.

24:43.567 --> 24:44.834
Dozer doesn't work.

24:55.734 --> 24:56.900
Up ahead...

24:56.900 --> 24:58.300
This is Justin.

24:58.300 --> 25:00.300
I heard you got a lot of
mining experience.

25:01.100 --> 25:03.300
After the rock smashed it,

25:03.300 --> 25:04.834
I was stuck there
for two hours.

25:15.333 --> 25:19.767
Where we're working right now
isn't necessarily our norm.

25:19.767 --> 25:23.233
It's not gonna be our normal
dredging that you get
introduced to.

25:24.066 --> 25:25.400
All I wanna see is the gold.

25:26.467 --> 25:27.700
At Porcupine Creek,

25:29.367 --> 25:32.734
after an aborted first dive
into the pilings pond...

25:33.200 --> 25:34.600
Hey, guys.

25:34.600 --> 25:37.367
...Kayla adds
much needed manpower
to the operation.

25:38.266 --> 25:39.600
This is Justin.

25:39.600 --> 25:42.033
- Justin, Paul and Scott.
- How you doing, Justin? Paul.

25:42.033 --> 25:43.367
- Hello, Paul.
- Nice to meet you.

25:43.367 --> 25:47.333
She has called in
an experienced mining contact.

25:47.333 --> 25:49.133
I heard you got a lot
of mining experience.

25:50.333 --> 25:51.967
Yeah, I've been
mining for almost 30 years.

25:52.600 --> 25:54.266
Most of my life,

25:54.266 --> 25:55.767
since my first pan at
nine years old.

25:58.033 --> 26:01.734
Justin Peterson,
a welder from Wasilla, Alaska,

26:03.133 --> 26:05.333
and a power lifter,

26:05.333 --> 26:08.700
is no stranger to the risks
of gold mining.

26:08.700 --> 26:11.734
He lost his finger
to a boulder.

26:11.734 --> 26:15.934
After the rock had landed
on my finger and smashed it,

26:15.934 --> 26:17.667
I was stuck there
for two hours.

26:17.667 --> 26:20.133
It actually damaged these two
as well.

26:20.133 --> 26:24.133
And... But they were able to
save those two fingers.

26:24.133 --> 26:26.433
And now, only things slip
through my pinky.

26:31.600 --> 26:35.133
Let's just look at it
real quick and figure it out.

26:35.133 --> 26:40.266
The extra set
of muscles allows Kayla to
change up her mining strategy

26:40.266 --> 26:43.033
ahead of her second dive
in the dangerous conditions.

26:45.834 --> 26:49.834
This whole location thing,
this isn't ideal.

26:49.834 --> 26:53.100
I think we're gonna have to
revert to putting
the dredge over here.

26:54.467 --> 26:57.867
We can almost hang
a ladder off that platform.

26:57.867 --> 26:59.300
That'd be kind of
awesome to have a little

26:59.300 --> 27:00.767
floating island out there
with it.

27:05.400 --> 27:06.634
On their last dive,

27:06.634 --> 27:09.934
the crew used the upstream
bank to enter the pond,

27:11.500 --> 27:14.300
but disturbed the loose
material on the bottom

27:14.300 --> 27:17.867
and got dangerously tangled
on the remains of the pilings.

27:18.767 --> 27:20.367
Kayla's new plan,

27:20.367 --> 27:23.133
move the dredge into
the middle of the pond

27:23.133 --> 27:27.600
to gain clear access and dive
directly down to bedrock gold.

27:29.533 --> 27:30.734
I'll clear the rocks.

27:33.066 --> 27:35.000
- Can you hold this
in place for me?
- I sure can.

27:39.800 --> 27:41.834
- Let's see if that works.
- Yeah.

27:45.100 --> 27:46.300
So, hopefully,

27:47.100 --> 27:49.500
today goes a lot smoother.

27:49.500 --> 27:52.133
I would love to say that
we're gonna find gold today.

27:52.133 --> 27:53.333
I really hope we do.

28:08.100 --> 28:10.767
You gotta lower that
nozzle all the way down.

28:10.767 --> 28:14.000
I'd come over there
and help you,
but I might tip the boat over.

28:14.000 --> 28:15.867
I got it.

28:16.567 --> 28:18.033
Okay.

28:18.033 --> 28:21.700
This time,
Kayla's also prepared
for the bad visibility.

28:21.700 --> 28:22.834
Turn my light
on for me?

28:24.767 --> 28:25.567
Thank you.

28:26.400 --> 28:27.333
See you later.

28:33.367 --> 28:35.934
How is your visibility with
having that light on?

28:35.934 --> 28:37.433
Um,
not that great.

28:42.000 --> 28:43.767
I can't see the rocks but...

28:43.767 --> 28:46.133
Like, I can see the light
on my hand, maybe.

28:46.133 --> 28:47.700
But I can't see any rocks.

28:49.834 --> 28:52.066
Copy that.

28:52.066 --> 28:55.300
I'm still, like,
feeling my way around
to get to the bottom.

28:55.300 --> 28:58.634
There's like, so much
sludge in the bottom of
this hole.

29:00.967 --> 29:02.567
One's stuck to my wrists.

29:05.133 --> 29:07.333
In this pond,
we stir stuff up,

29:07.333 --> 29:08.834
it spreads around everywhere,

29:08.834 --> 29:10.834
and then, we're just diving in
a cloud of silt.

29:11.834 --> 29:13.867
It's gonna be frustrating
for the diver.

29:13.867 --> 29:17.867
Who knew that a pond would
create so many problems?

29:24.767 --> 29:27.066
Need a little
section of that sludge
cleared off.

29:29.333 --> 29:31.100
I feel like there's
a block up.

29:33.266 --> 29:37.266
I'll check and see.
There is water coming,
but it looks low.

29:37.266 --> 29:41.166
Dredging blind,
Kayla senses a blockage
in her hose.

29:43.166 --> 29:44.800
Thank you.

29:44.800 --> 29:48.567
So, Kayla's water flow
has slowed down and...

29:48.567 --> 29:51.333
we used the cable to try
and snake

29:51.333 --> 29:54.000
to see if we can get
the plug up and the hose out.

30:04.333 --> 30:05.700
- Feel something?
- Yeah.

30:09.166 --> 30:10.767
How deep and down
is it?

30:13.367 --> 30:14.934
Oh, I see it
right there.

30:23.166 --> 30:25.600
Um, you know what?

30:25.600 --> 30:28.567
If we pull the hose
over the ladder
and drape the nozzle over,

30:28.567 --> 30:31.166
that way it'll fall back out,
instead of getting
wedged again.

30:31.166 --> 30:32.667
- Gotcha.
- That's right. That's right.

30:33.467 --> 30:34.400
All right.

30:38.634 --> 30:40.100
Ah, it's a stick.

30:43.166 --> 30:47.100
That should be it.
I think that's it.

30:47.100 --> 30:50.400
With that murky water
down there, you cannot see
what goes in your nozzle.

30:51.400 --> 30:54.467
So, you end up taking a stick,

30:54.467 --> 30:57.000
it gets wedged,
rock wedges against it,

30:57.834 --> 30:59.700
and then you got a plug up.

30:59.700 --> 31:01.433
But being underwater
with no visibility,

31:01.433 --> 31:03.500
you can't find where
the plug up is in your hose.

31:03.500 --> 31:06.934
So, no visibility
is definitely a...

31:07.634 --> 31:09.033
It's gonna slow us down a lot.

31:11.266 --> 31:13.900
Despite
the challenges of
the pilings pond...

31:15.867 --> 31:17.166
Did you find
the nozzle?

31:17.166 --> 31:18.934
Yeah,
I'm trying to unhook it
right now.

31:18.934 --> 31:22.033
...Kayla is
straight back to
hunting bedrock.

31:22.033 --> 31:23.600
There's a deeper
section here.

31:25.400 --> 31:26.700
I exposed that rock bed.

31:26.700 --> 31:29.200
But you could feel, like,
there's some ridges in it.

31:29.200 --> 31:31.333
But there's still
good sized rocks.

31:33.467 --> 31:35.333
You think you're clearing off
bedrock now?

31:36.433 --> 31:38.734
Well, I cleared off
the section.

31:38.734 --> 31:40.934
I cleaned off the mid-section
of the sludge,

31:40.934 --> 31:43.500
at the bottom of that is
a bunch of rocks that
I went through.

31:43.500 --> 31:47.367
And now, it feels like I might
be cleaning off bedrock.

31:47.367 --> 31:49.900
But, you know,
with no visibility,
it's hard to see. But...

31:50.533 --> 31:51.767
that's what it feels like.

31:54.333 --> 31:57.033
Kayla's getting
after it.

31:57.033 --> 31:59.967
She knows how to work.
She set the bar high for me
being the new guy.

32:02.300 --> 32:05.567
If you have a bad start
to a day, but at the end,
there's gold in that pot,

32:05.567 --> 32:07.834
you forget about that
bad start for the day.

32:07.834 --> 32:11.567
- Yeah, the problems all
are worth it.
- Exactly.

32:11.567 --> 32:13.834
I'm hoping to get
a good amount of
material moved,

32:13.834 --> 32:16.734
and I hope that we can ...

32:20.734 --> 32:21.800
Up ahead...

32:21.800 --> 32:23.900
Whee-hoo!

32:24.567 --> 32:25.900
Yeah!

32:25.900 --> 32:27.734
damn, I made it!

32:27.734 --> 32:31.567
All the experience in the past
is going to come to bear
right now.

32:31.567 --> 32:34.367
Come see! I've got some
gold, man!

32:34.367 --> 32:35.734
Hell yeah!

32:35.734 --> 32:37.600
Right there.
Right there.

32:37.600 --> 32:39.600
- Oh, yeah!
- Whoo-hoo!

32:44.300 --> 32:45.600
At Nugget Creek,

32:47.533 --> 32:50.233
as Fred's hot water
sprinkler system attempts

32:50.233 --> 32:52.600
to melt Dustin's
ice-covered claim,

32:54.767 --> 32:57.634
1,500 feet down creek,

32:57.634 --> 33:00.133
his dream of constructing
an airstrip,

33:00.133 --> 33:03.767
a vital supply line,
hangs in the balance.

33:03.767 --> 33:06.467
Does this come
off, too? Is there a way
to get in here?

33:06.467 --> 33:08.800
If I can't keep
this thing running,

33:08.800 --> 33:12.567
my guys will have to look
for another job.

33:15.967 --> 33:17.066
We're at a standstill, guys.

33:19.033 --> 33:21.467
Until we get this fixed,
this is done.

33:23.567 --> 33:24.634
Is that dirty?

33:24.634 --> 33:26.834
Look how dirty that is
on the bottom.

33:27.700 --> 33:28.967
Well, cool.

33:28.967 --> 33:30.767
So, radiator's
plugged up.

33:30.767 --> 33:33.734
30 years of dirt
on the radiator fins

33:33.734 --> 33:35.900
has caused the dozer
to overheat.

33:36.700 --> 33:38.834
That could be the problem.

33:38.834 --> 33:41.300
Hopefully, that is
what's killing us right now.

33:42.333 --> 33:45.133
So, we're gonna pressure wash
these fins off.

33:48.433 --> 33:50.100
We've been working this
thing pretty hard.

33:50.834 --> 33:52.200
I've been on it
almost everyday.

33:56.166 --> 33:58.800
Without
this dozer, we're in trouble.

34:06.000 --> 34:08.900
- Holy, [bleep].
Look at that [bleep].
- ...all that grit.

34:08.900 --> 34:10.333
That'll make it heat up, dude.

34:11.066 --> 34:12.233
I hope this works.

34:13.533 --> 34:14.800
I'm starting to see
through it.

34:14.800 --> 34:16.100
- You see the difference?
- Nice.

34:16.100 --> 34:17.900
- I see
the difference, dude.
- Yeah.

34:17.900 --> 34:19.367
- I thought that was normal.
- Holy smokes.

34:19.367 --> 34:21.200
- Do you see where
it stopped?
- Yeah.

34:21.200 --> 34:23.634
Thank that's it, man.
What do you think?

34:23.634 --> 34:26.300
Dude, you can see
right through it, man.
It's tissue paper now.

34:29.867 --> 34:31.600
You guys wanna see
if this thing runs?

34:31.600 --> 34:32.433
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

34:33.033 --> 34:34.266
All right. Power on.

34:35.133 --> 34:36.066
Come on, baby.

34:46.066 --> 34:47.834
Guarantee it wouldn't
be blowing bubbles.

34:50.367 --> 34:52.066
Hey, the oil light
went out.

34:52.066 --> 34:53.266
Awesome.

34:53.266 --> 34:55.200
I think that's
gonna do it.

34:55.200 --> 34:58.767
There's only one real way
to find out, I gotta go work
it hard.

35:03.867 --> 35:07.333
Holy, [bleep]. I thought this
was gone.

35:08.066 --> 35:08.900
Wow.

35:10.867 --> 35:12.400
It hasn't overheated yet.

35:13.533 --> 35:15.667
Think our little
pressure washer trick worked.

35:17.066 --> 35:19.834
The radiator was stopped up
and now it's not.

35:23.734 --> 35:25.200
Bubbles, the Dozer,

35:26.233 --> 35:27.400
it might be a little crazy,

35:27.400 --> 35:29.767
you might've sucked up
a little too much
exhaust fumes.

35:29.767 --> 35:32.834
I'm pretty sure I heard
Bubbles say,
"I love you, Dustin."

35:34.867 --> 35:39.667
Bubbles, the Dozer,
and her spring cleaned
radiator limp on

35:39.667 --> 35:42.467
in an attempt to
salvage a season

35:42.467 --> 35:44.467
that is slowly slipping away.

35:45.033 --> 35:46.467
Whoo!

35:50.333 --> 35:52.333
Ah, [bleep].

35:52.333 --> 35:53.533
We got 'em done!

35:54.800 --> 35:56.967
No more trees in the way.

35:56.967 --> 35:59.600
I can't believe
this dozer did that.

36:00.834 --> 36:03.433
That, right there, is the last
of the vegetation.

36:05.166 --> 36:07.500
All I have is dirt work left.

36:07.500 --> 36:10.033
This should be no problem
after this.

36:16.233 --> 36:17.667
She's on
the bottom, man.

36:17.667 --> 36:19.100
Yeah. Yeah.

36:19.100 --> 36:22.033
There's more
material down here
than I thought.

36:22.033 --> 36:23.467
Back across
the mountain,

36:23.467 --> 36:25.800
at Mark Seben's
Porcupine claim...

36:26.533 --> 36:27.700
Lot of material.

36:29.734 --> 36:33.166
Kayla's three hours
into her zero-vis dive,

36:33.767 --> 36:35.734
dredging on bedrock.

36:35.734 --> 36:40.333
Both crews are banking on
the piling's pond delivering
fast gold

36:40.333 --> 36:43.967
to keep Dustin's
operation afloat.

36:43.967 --> 36:47.433
I was
kind of curious if Mark said
he just barely touched bedrock

36:47.433 --> 36:49.700
and he was getting gold
out of what he was running,

36:51.000 --> 36:53.834
that means, he left a lot of
good material down there.

36:55.634 --> 36:57.567
Feels like
I don't have good suction.

36:59.266 --> 37:01.433
All right.
I'll try running a snake
down it real quick.

37:06.900 --> 37:08.400
Oh, now it
feels better.

37:09.600 --> 37:12.433
- You got it.
- Whatever it was,

37:12.433 --> 37:14.500
it must've come loose.

37:14.500 --> 37:17.200
No, there was a big rock that
was stuck on this and
We got it out.

37:17.200 --> 37:18.900
Gotcha. Thank you.

37:21.367 --> 37:24.266
Yeah, so every time we
encounter those green rocks,

37:24.266 --> 37:25.934
we usually find gold.

37:25.934 --> 37:28.734
That's one of
the most common signs
of serpentine or

37:28.734 --> 37:31.266
the dense, green stones,
the heavy, green ones.

37:31.266 --> 37:32.533
Yeah.

37:32.533 --> 37:34.967
It's always been a good thing
for me on my gold encounters.

37:34.967 --> 37:36.600
I take it as a good sign.

37:36.600 --> 37:38.166
And the history of this place
right here,

37:38.166 --> 37:40.934
all the old timers,
when the hit bedrock,

37:40.934 --> 37:42.767
that's when they hit
the paystreak.

37:42.767 --> 37:44.767
- That's when they did
jazz hands?
- Yeah.

37:44.767 --> 37:46.433
So, I kind of expect to see
some gold in the box

37:46.433 --> 37:48.400
if she's actually
cleaning up bedrock.

37:49.033 --> 37:51.200
It might be... a good dive.

37:53.066 --> 37:57.000
I feel like
a dog chasing its own tail.

37:57.000 --> 37:58.834
I can't see [bleep] down here.

37:59.500 --> 38:00.867
I'm coming up.

38:00.867 --> 38:03.300
After four hours
diving blind,

38:04.233 --> 38:05.533
Kayla calls time.

38:06.467 --> 38:08.233
Grab my, this hand,
right here.

38:08.233 --> 38:09.667
Pull me up.

38:09.667 --> 38:13.433
Now, she's eager
to see if the risk will
earn a reward.

38:21.934 --> 38:23.700
I'm not
seeing anything.

38:23.700 --> 38:25.467
- Nothing obvious.
- No.

38:26.300 --> 38:27.233
That sucks.

38:29.567 --> 38:32.667
Struggling,
all for nothing.

38:32.667 --> 38:34.634
I'm ready to go back
to the creek.

38:34.634 --> 38:36.100
If we're completely
wasting our time,

38:36.100 --> 38:38.800
I'm not gonna spend much more
time in this hole.

38:38.800 --> 38:40.834
I think it's just, like,
a death trap.

38:41.500 --> 38:42.400
I'm gonna call it.

38:55.533 --> 38:57.567
- It has been a rough week.
- Yeah, it has.

38:59.367 --> 39:01.433
I got so much done
on that dozer.

39:04.467 --> 39:07.200
- What's that?
- Ooh,
that's the fast one.

39:07.200 --> 39:10.333
At Nugget Creek,
Dustin's new airstrip

39:10.333 --> 39:11.767
is open for business.

39:14.333 --> 39:15.967
Hope he lands right.

39:15.967 --> 39:17.333
Holy [bleep]!

39:18.834 --> 39:20.166
Of course he did.

39:20.166 --> 39:22.233
I think that's what Fred's
coming in.

39:22.233 --> 39:23.867
Wonder what he'd think
about Nugget Creek.

39:27.834 --> 39:31.200
- Yee-hoo!
- That's a grand entrance
you made there.

39:31.200 --> 39:32.934
damn, I made it!

39:32.934 --> 39:36.500
It's been 17 years since
I've been up this canyon.

39:36.500 --> 39:38.600
- Yeah? What'd you think?
- Beautiful.

39:38.934 --> 39:40.500
Beautiful.

39:40.500 --> 39:42.934
Dustin's father,
Dakota Fred,

39:42.934 --> 39:45.066
could not have come
at a better time.

39:46.233 --> 39:47.166
All right.

39:48.066 --> 39:49.867
- Hey, fellas!
- How's it going, Fred?

39:49.867 --> 39:51.500
How y'all doing?

39:51.500 --> 39:53.734
- damn, Carlos.
- Nice to see you, man.

39:53.734 --> 39:55.400
- ..., Fred.
- Yeah. Yeah.

39:55.800 --> 39:56.900
Whoa!

39:58.033 --> 39:59.600
Well, welcome to camp, Fred.

39:59.600 --> 40:03.166
- Well, good.
- This is our new life for now.

40:03.166 --> 40:05.567
What do you think about our
new site, Nugget Creek, here?

40:05.567 --> 40:09.033
Well, one of the most
beautiful spots on the world.

40:09.033 --> 40:11.867
Problem what we're
dealing with right now is,
there is

40:11.867 --> 40:14.233
lots of ice and snow
right now,

40:14.233 --> 40:15.233
tons of it.

40:15.233 --> 40:17.467
But we're trying that heater
that you sent up,

40:17.467 --> 40:21.233
and everything we can
to melt snow.

40:21.233 --> 40:25.300
This has been the hardest to
get to place we've ever been,
I think.

40:25.300 --> 40:27.533
- It's dangerous.
- I can imagine.

40:27.533 --> 40:30.934
Up here, it's white water.
A lot of white water, man.

40:30.934 --> 40:32.100
- Wow.
- It's way different.

40:33.000 --> 40:34.100
Tell you what...

40:34.100 --> 40:37.367
...all
the experience in the past

40:37.367 --> 40:39.500
is gonna come to bear
right now.

40:40.433 --> 40:42.567
Oh, Lord.

40:42.567 --> 40:45.934
I'm stoked to get out there
and take a look at that thing

40:45.934 --> 40:48.433
and give it
a critical eyeball.

40:48.433 --> 40:50.600
- Yeah.
- And see if I got any ideas.

40:50.600 --> 40:52.433
Let's go find out what
we gotta do.

40:52.433 --> 40:53.600
All right.

40:55.000 --> 40:57.033
Dustin bit off more
than he could chew?

40:57.033 --> 40:58.400
I don't think so.

40:58.400 --> 41:00.967
But we're gonna have
to do a lot of figuring
to figure out

41:00.967 --> 41:03.000
how to make this doable.

41:03.000 --> 41:06.333
I'm gonna try to give him
just as much advice,

41:06.333 --> 41:08.533
even if it irritates
the [bleep] out of him.

41:11.834 --> 41:14.200
The first 500 yards
to the creek

41:14.200 --> 41:16.767
are quickly covered in an ATV.

41:17.634 --> 41:19.367
There's no snow here.

41:19.367 --> 41:22.367
I don't see a damn piece
of snow anywhere.

41:22.367 --> 41:24.967
There's a ton of snow
up there.

41:24.967 --> 41:27.834
I mean, 20 plus feet.

41:27.834 --> 41:29.834
So, there's a hike that
goes up and over.

41:29.834 --> 41:32.734
If you want, we could put you
in weights and walk
you straight up the creek.

41:32.734 --> 41:33.800
There's some ropes for you.

41:33.800 --> 41:36.667
- I... I decline that.
- Okay.

41:36.667 --> 41:38.567
Well...

41:38.567 --> 41:42.967
This goes up 500 feet,
straight up and down.

41:42.967 --> 41:45.066
- Where's the elevator?
- Yeah.

41:45.066 --> 41:46.400
Let's see what
you think?

41:47.500 --> 41:49.767
- Be careful, Fred.
- I'll go up last.

41:50.400 --> 41:51.800
No, I need to be...

41:51.800 --> 41:54.567
- If you fail, I need to
be there. So...
- Uh...

41:54.567 --> 41:56.800
You guys head up
and we'll catch up to you.

41:56.800 --> 41:59.634
- All right.
- All right, I'll just
follow you guys up.

42:07.967 --> 42:12.100
78-years old Fred
starts a 500-foot climb.

42:13.700 --> 42:15.367
Been hiking
much, Fred?

42:16.200 --> 42:18.033
Nope.

42:18.033 --> 42:20.033
Unfortunately.

42:22.133 --> 42:24.567
Man, if you don't
come hang out with me more,
you're gonna get old.

42:25.266 --> 42:26.834
Bull [bleep].

42:36.266 --> 42:38.867
- Give me two.
- Yeah, take your
time, man.

42:40.700 --> 42:43.000
- Holy cow.
- That's
beautiful, man.

42:43.900 --> 42:45.000
Wow.

42:47.266 --> 42:49.200
- Intimidating.
- Oh, man.

42:49.200 --> 42:51.367
Look, we got here,

42:51.367 --> 42:54.834
and I gotta tell you,
I've been in over my head
the entire time.

43:02.066 --> 43:05.533
You couldn't have
picked any easier place to go?

43:05.533 --> 43:09.900
Fred's hot water
sprinkler has been running
across the clock.

43:09.900 --> 43:13.333
I hope that that
heater that you sent up
worked for us to melt snow.

43:14.600 --> 43:16.400
If the ice
hasn't melted,

43:16.400 --> 43:18.600
Dustin's season will be over

43:18.600 --> 43:20.200
before it's even begun.

43:21.400 --> 43:22.433
Check it out.

43:33.000 --> 43:35.734
- Dustin
and his crew...
- Check it out.

43:35.734 --> 43:39.900
...are about to
find out if Fred's plan to
melt the ice has worked.

43:41.500 --> 43:43.867
Holy [bleep], y'all did it!

43:45.934 --> 43:47.266
It worked.

43:47.266 --> 43:49.767
All the snow has melted.

43:54.100 --> 43:56.300
- So, Fred.
- Yeah?

43:56.300 --> 43:59.367
The ice was out to here,
when we got here.

43:59.367 --> 44:01.233
- Wow.
- This is where
the ice was,

44:01.233 --> 44:03.133
right here, Fred, look.

44:03.133 --> 44:06.133
And it was ten to 12
to 20 feet thick in places.

44:06.133 --> 44:08.600
Yep, huge!

44:08.600 --> 44:11.066
- It was all the way across
here, Fred.
- Right here.

44:11.066 --> 44:12.500
Holy [bleep].

44:12.500 --> 44:14.934
Whoo-hoo-hoo! It's going!

44:15.467 --> 44:17.600
It's go-time.

44:17.600 --> 44:20.433
Good job, guys.
I didn't know what we
did here, but we're here.

44:20.433 --> 44:22.333
Yeah. [bleep] Yeah!

44:22.333 --> 44:23.634
- Dude.
- Good job, dude.

44:23.634 --> 44:26.667
- Look a that [bleep] boulder.
- I see it.

44:26.667 --> 44:28.967
Just seeing that boulder
by itself

44:28.967 --> 44:31.767
makes me think of how much
gold's underneath it.

44:33.967 --> 44:36.200
It's stuck
in the gates,
is what I call that.

44:36.200 --> 44:39.100
It's stuck right in between
these two gates.

44:39.100 --> 44:40.700
- Yeah.
- Look at this.

44:40.700 --> 44:46.233
- Golden Gates.
- We call it the Golden Gates.

44:46.233 --> 44:50.333
- Look at that.
- Our new dig site
is the Golden Gates, boys.

44:50.333 --> 44:53.066
This is where we're
gonna be for the season, guys.

44:53.066 --> 44:54.700
This is it, right here.

44:58.133 --> 44:59.533
Hey, let's go panning.

45:00.300 --> 45:02.667
Okay. Do what you do.

45:02.667 --> 45:04.900
Fred's immediately
on a mission

45:04.900 --> 45:07.600
to see if the newly christened
Golden Gate

45:08.266 --> 45:09.834
lives up to its name.

45:11.667 --> 45:13.900
Let's see what y'all
got in here. Anything?

45:18.000 --> 45:20.900
The fellows brought up
a bunch of dirt.

45:20.900 --> 45:24.233
Maybe they think there's
a little bit of gold in it.

45:24.233 --> 45:27.133
I think we go ahead
and find out if there is.

45:27.133 --> 45:29.300
Pan full of paydirt
for you.

45:30.266 --> 45:31.066
There you go, Fred.

45:32.200 --> 45:33.133
Thank you.

45:45.867 --> 45:48.467
Hey! Hey, Dustin!

45:50.767 --> 45:54.667
- Hey!
- Oh! Look at that.

45:54.667 --> 45:56.533
No way!

45:56.533 --> 45:58.467
Ya got some gold, man!

46:00.533 --> 46:02.934
Right there. Right there.

46:04.033 --> 46:06.300
- That's chunky gold.
- Wow!

46:06.300 --> 46:08.634
This ain't nothing like
the stuff at Porcupine.

46:09.533 --> 46:11.233
I see five.

46:11.233 --> 46:13.600
Five entire pieces.

46:13.600 --> 46:15.333
Holy cow.

46:15.333 --> 46:18.033
That's good
gold, dog!

46:18.033 --> 46:21.066
This is means for celebration
right here.

46:21.066 --> 46:23.333
So far, this is my
best day here.

46:23.333 --> 46:25.033
I finally have hope.

46:26.266 --> 46:29.033
- Go, let it!
Hell yeah!
- Wow!

46:29.033 --> 46:31.367
I think you're
in for a bonanza.

46:31.834 --> 46:32.834
I'm telling you.

46:32.834 --> 46:35.200
This is exciting, Fred.

46:35.200 --> 46:37.333
A test pan coming up
with that much color,

46:38.900 --> 46:40.233
in this?

46:40.233 --> 46:41.934
Holy moly.

46:41.934 --> 46:44.700
Everybody needs to
switch gears

46:44.700 --> 46:48.367
to get in that damn dredge
in the water right here
behind Fred.

46:48.367 --> 46:51.000
Let's move some rocks.

46:51.000 --> 46:53.934
- Let's dig some holes,
let's find some gold, man.
- Yep.

46:55.800 --> 46:58.867
Today is
an amazing day for me.

46:58.867 --> 47:01.033
I was getting worried that
we were gonna run out of cash.

47:02.300 --> 47:03.300
We're gonna find gold.

47:03.734 --> 47:04.533
Real soon.

47:05.066 --> 47:07.300
This is exciting.

47:07.300 --> 47:11.166
I have no doubt that there is
a bunch of gold here.

47:12.500 --> 47:14.400
I think it's a crew that
could do it.

47:19.333 --> 47:22.834
Next time
on Gold Rush White Water...

47:22.834 --> 47:25.266
This is what White Water's
all about.

47:25.266 --> 47:26.934
My wife would kill me.

47:26.934 --> 47:29.567
Three, two, one!

47:29.567 --> 47:31.367
- Watch out!
- Whoa! Whoa!

47:31.367 --> 47:32.700
Get ready to jack.

47:34.266 --> 47:36.433
Dump it out.
Just dump it out.

47:36.433 --> 47:38.867
It's hell to know stuff

47:38.867 --> 47:41.000
and not be able to pass it on
to people.

47:41.000 --> 47:43.700
Once we get around this grass,
there's land right here.

47:43.700 --> 47:45.567
It takes crazy to
find the gold.

47:45.567 --> 47:47.467
I'm just a little bit crazy.

47:47.867 --> 47:49.333
Whoa, snap.

47:49.333 --> 47:50.400
We gotta get
to digging.

47:50.400 --> 47:52.367
Let's get a diver
in the water, man.

47:53.800 --> 47:57.300
They're gonna be
dredging up gold.
I'm kind of betting on it.

47:57.300 --> 48:00.367
- This material
feels great.
- That is a good find.

48:00.367 --> 48:02.600
- It's been a long
dry spell but...
- Somebody had to break it.
