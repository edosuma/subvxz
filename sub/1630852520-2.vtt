WEBVTT

00:00.760 --> 00:02.296
The gunfire detection software

00:02.331 --> 00:04.296
ShotTipper is saving
time and money.

00:04.331 --> 00:08.494
Yeah, but ShotTipper registers
every loud noise as gunfire.

00:09.760 --> 00:10.989
Keegan?

00:11.024 --> 00:12.428
I ain't got nothing
to say to you.

00:12.463 --> 00:14.296
You're not loyal to him,
you're not loyal to us.

00:14.331 --> 00:15.824
Who are you loyal to, Kelly?

00:15.859 --> 00:18.428
- Here we go.
- Oh, my God, Mom!

00:18.463 --> 00:20.164
Put your clothes on,
you dirty dogs!

00:20.199 --> 00:21.824
The curtains aren't even closed.

00:21.859 --> 00:24.098
I know,
I'm bad at relationships.

00:24.496 --> 00:27.527
- Len Grierson?
- There was that one good one.

00:28.430 --> 00:30.428
Nathan.
- Hmm. And where he at?

00:30.463 --> 00:31.791
Nathan?

00:31.826 --> 00:33.032
I want to end it
with Gabrielle.

00:33.067 --> 00:34.791
She's great.

00:34.826 --> 00:35.923
It's never going anywhere

00:35.958 --> 00:37.164
as long as
you're in the picture.

00:37.199 --> 00:38.923
You dated DS Michaels?

00:38.958 --> 00:40.395
I still haven't told Nathan.

00:40.430 --> 00:42.857
Honestly, it's the first time
I've felt hopeful about--

00:56.562 --> 00:58.395
Duff?

00:59.430 --> 01:00.890
Duff?

01:02.463 --> 01:03.626
Hey.

01:04.199 --> 01:05.791
Are you okay?

01:07.826 --> 01:10.824
You couldn't take two minutes
to put some pants on?

01:12.991 --> 01:15.131
You're okay.

01:19.826 --> 01:21.725
Gabrielle...

01:23.793 --> 01:26.131
She was right in the middle
of telling me something.

01:26.166 --> 01:28.758
I don't think we'd spoken
that much in our lives.

01:29.529 --> 01:31.494
Wait, does Nathan know?
Someone needs to call Nathan.

01:31.529 --> 01:33.626
He's on his way
to the hospital.

01:33.661 --> 01:35.758
Okay, but did you tell him
I tried to go with her?

01:35.793 --> 01:38.329
Yes. And I also told him
that we needed to get you

01:38.364 --> 01:40.131
to the station,
do a full interview.

01:40.166 --> 01:42.362
Okay. But I didn't
see anything.

01:45.331 --> 01:47.197
We came into the courtyard,
it was empty.

01:47.232 --> 01:49.362
There was no kids, nothing.

01:49.397 --> 01:51.593
I saw the casings
from the fireworks,

01:51.628 --> 01:53.527
assumed that's what
set off the ShotTipper,

01:53.562 --> 01:55.131
same as yesterday,
same as the day before.

01:55.166 --> 01:57.032
You didn't have
your gun drawn?

01:57.397 --> 02:00.164
No. I don't go
into neighbourhoods

02:00.199 --> 02:02.395
with my gun drawn
unless I have to.

02:03.166 --> 02:05.131
It was my third time
there in two days.

02:05.430 --> 02:07.395
And afterwards,
you saw nothing?

02:07.430 --> 02:10.593
I was focused
on Sergeant Beauchamp.

02:10.628 --> 02:11.791
As you can see.

02:15.595 --> 02:18.659
Uh, Sam, can you please drive
Kelly back to the station

02:18.694 --> 02:21.659
so we can take her clothes
and get her statement?

02:21.694 --> 02:25.725
And I will let you know as soon
as Gabrielle is out of surgery.

02:25.760 --> 02:27.593
Okay? Kelly...

02:28.232 --> 02:30.395
This is not your fault.

02:32.463 --> 02:33.791
I know.

02:37.793 --> 02:39.890
Stealing chips from
convenience stores now?

02:39.925 --> 02:42.164
No, dummy. Who do you
take me for, Ma Barker?

02:42.199 --> 02:43.626
I don't even know who that is.

02:43.661 --> 02:46.098
She's like a ruthless criminal
mastermind from the 1930s.

02:46.133 --> 02:48.263
Actually, you know,
there's a debate about...

02:51.199 --> 02:52.824
You're okay.

02:53.232 --> 02:55.131
You're okay.

03:15.430 --> 03:17.395
Morning, Mom.
Did you sleep well?

03:17.430 --> 03:20.098
No. I heard you
coming and going.

03:20.133 --> 03:22.362
What's a grown woman
doing up at 1:00 a.m.?

03:22.397 --> 03:24.758
Oh, one of my colleagues
got shot last night.

03:24.793 --> 03:26.461
- Dead?
- No.

03:27.694 --> 03:30.296
Okay, sorry to disappoint you.

03:31.826 --> 03:34.999
Hmm, that bed is like
sleeping on rocks.

03:35.529 --> 03:39.131
I'll adjust, I suppose.
It's only for two months.

03:39.166 --> 03:40.395
Maybe three.

03:40.826 --> 03:43.032
Okay, well, listen, um...
I've gotta get to work.

03:43.067 --> 03:44.296
There's a ton of food
in the fridge.

03:44.331 --> 03:45.923
Oh, don't worry about me.

03:45.958 --> 03:47.824
I can look after myself.

03:48.958 --> 03:50.362
Wait...

03:50.397 --> 03:52.065
Do you have rubber gloves?

03:52.397 --> 03:54.461
I have to give this kitchen
a proper scrub.

03:54.496 --> 03:57.164
There is grit
around the sink.

03:57.199 --> 03:58.626
Okay, no, there's not, Mom,

03:58.661 --> 04:00.659
because I keep
my house spotless.

04:00.694 --> 04:03.098
You keep it Samantha-spotless.

04:03.133 --> 04:04.890
I like things Judy-spotless.

04:06.133 --> 04:07.164
What time will you be home?

04:07.199 --> 04:09.263
I will be home
as soon as I can.

04:09.298 --> 04:10.791
Alright.

04:11.199 --> 04:12.857
When you get home,
I want to talk to you

04:12.892 --> 04:14.230
about this Naz character.

04:14.265 --> 04:16.461
- Well, I'd rather not.
- Oh...

04:16.496 --> 04:19.890
I don't want to see you
get hurt, he's too young.

04:20.364 --> 04:23.098
He's never gonna stick around
during menopause.

04:23.133 --> 04:25.098
Oh, geez, well, I...

04:25.133 --> 04:26.989
I'm like, years away
from menopause, so...

04:27.024 --> 04:28.197
Oh...

04:28.232 --> 04:31.032
You think you are,
but you're not.

04:31.529 --> 04:33.494
You should've stuck with Steve.

04:33.529 --> 04:36.230
He's tall and just the right
amount of handsome.

04:36.265 --> 04:38.230
You don't think that Naz
is too handsome?

04:38.265 --> 04:39.296
Is there such a thing?

04:39.331 --> 04:40.725
I mean, for you.

04:41.694 --> 04:45.659
It's fine. I don't mean
to put doubts in your mind.

04:45.694 --> 04:48.890
You go, you go. It's okay.
- Okay.

04:48.925 --> 04:51.131
But if you're gonna keep
a younger man, know this,

04:51.166 --> 04:52.989
it's a bad idea to go around

04:53.024 --> 04:54.131
with your hair
looking like that.

04:54.166 --> 04:56.395
Thank you. Thanks.

04:56.430 --> 04:57.923
Okay, have a great day.

04:57.958 --> 04:59.692
You too, sweetie.

05:11.100 --> 05:13.527
Uh... hey, could you
give these

05:13.562 --> 05:16.461
to Officer Gabrielle Beauchamp
in room 311?

05:16.496 --> 05:17.824
Hey!

05:19.694 --> 05:21.923
Hey! How is she?

05:21.958 --> 05:23.659
She's, uh, stable.

05:24.595 --> 05:27.791
I mean, she's not awake yet,
but, uh...

05:28.859 --> 05:30.494
Looks like she's gonna be okay.

05:30.529 --> 05:32.494
Good. That's really good.

05:32.529 --> 05:35.560
Um, I just...
wanted to drop these off.

05:35.991 --> 05:37.725
Thanks. Hey, hey...

05:37.760 --> 05:40.758
What I was saying before--
- I'm glad she has you.

05:42.024 --> 05:43.758
She's gonna need you.

05:45.364 --> 05:47.461
- You--
- Yeah, I gotta go.

06:05.925 --> 06:07.692
Kelly, Kelly, Kelly.

06:07.727 --> 06:11.263
I need you to fill out this IOD
for Sergeant Beauchamp.

06:11.298 --> 06:13.098
Injured on Duty report?

06:13.133 --> 06:15.890
And I want you to go see
the therapist.

06:15.925 --> 06:18.923
I don't need to see that doc
again, boss. I'm good.

06:18.958 --> 06:20.230
You are no good to me

06:20.265 --> 06:21.659
if you're all in your head
about this.

06:21.694 --> 06:24.593
I'm fine. Can't you see?
Don't I look good?

06:24.628 --> 06:27.131
I mean, I'm just gonna
throw myself back in my work,

06:27.166 --> 06:28.065
like I always do.

06:28.100 --> 06:30.461
No. You know that you can't

06:30.496 --> 06:31.725
investigate this shooting,
right?

06:31.760 --> 06:34.065
I know. I know.

06:35.760 --> 06:38.428
Kelly, your colleague was shot
right next to you last night.

06:38.463 --> 06:41.164
And you're going to have
some feelings about that.

06:41.199 --> 06:43.296
So go see the shrink, or don't,

06:43.331 --> 06:45.791
but just don't hide
from those feelings.

06:45.826 --> 06:47.527
Who said anything
about hiding?

06:47.562 --> 06:50.461
Work, fine. Talk it out, good.

06:50.496 --> 06:52.131
Scream and yell,
that's okay too.

06:52.166 --> 06:54.428
Just... do it in your car.

06:56.364 --> 06:58.230
I never pegged you
for a car-screamer.

06:58.265 --> 06:59.890
Every lunch hour.

06:59.925 --> 07:01.362
Where'd you think
I was going? The spa?

07:07.331 --> 07:09.494
It's pointless.

07:11.364 --> 07:13.395
Hey, partner.
Have I got something for you.

07:13.430 --> 07:14.989
Look, I got this map
of Marshall Court.

07:15.024 --> 07:18.362
All these tabs,
where the security cameras are--

07:18.397 --> 07:20.032
Ah, uh... No.
We're not allowed

07:20.067 --> 07:22.230
to investigate, remember?
Wish I could, but...

07:22.265 --> 07:23.494
I was a witness.

07:23.529 --> 07:25.296
True. But you know what,
we are Guns and Gangs,

07:25.331 --> 07:27.164
so we're allowed
to investigate... guns.

07:27.595 --> 07:29.626
- Also true.
- Mm-hmm.

07:29.661 --> 07:31.626
Alright. So what do you got?
Did the gun turn up?

07:31.661 --> 07:33.263
No. But in order
to find the gun,

07:33.298 --> 07:34.593
we gotta look into
the shooting, right?

07:34.628 --> 07:37.164
So, I asked Naz to get
the ballistics on the bullet,

07:37.199 --> 07:38.923
and I looked at the security
footage from the courtyard.

07:38.958 --> 07:40.923
And judging from the angle
where the bullet shot Gabrielle,

07:40.958 --> 07:42.857
we have a pretty good idea
of where the shooter

07:42.892 --> 07:43.758
was standing.

07:43.793 --> 07:45.956
And it's the only place
on that block

07:45.991 --> 07:47.659
that isn't visible
by the security camera.

07:47.694 --> 07:49.230
So it's making me think
the shooter knew

07:49.265 --> 07:50.659
exactly where
those cameras were.

07:50.694 --> 07:52.758
Yeah, I gotta talk to Keegan.

07:52.793 --> 07:53.791
What? Why?

07:53.826 --> 07:56.131
Because him and Crystal
were giving me grief

07:56.166 --> 07:57.395
about the ShotTipper
the other day.

07:57.430 --> 07:58.824
Said I was begging for trouble.

07:58.859 --> 08:01.362
You don't actually think
that Keegan shot Gabrielle.

08:01.397 --> 08:03.692
Alright...
It wasn't Keegan, alright?

08:03.727 --> 08:07.197
But if someone in Marshall Court
has a hate-on for cops,

08:07.232 --> 08:08.791
he'll know about it.

08:09.430 --> 08:10.560
Do you think
it was targeted?

08:10.595 --> 08:12.659
Well...

08:14.024 --> 08:16.329
I feel like we were lured there.

08:16.826 --> 08:18.626
And that someone
set off fireworks,

08:18.661 --> 08:20.098
got all the kids to clear out,

08:20.133 --> 08:22.956
and... waited for us to show up.

08:24.199 --> 08:26.164
Is that... crazy?

08:26.199 --> 08:27.428
No. Not really.

08:27.463 --> 08:30.758
Hey, I got
the forensics report

08:30.793 --> 08:33.032
on the casing retrieved
from the scene.

08:33.067 --> 08:34.133
There's no prints on it.

08:34.168 --> 08:36.065
Ballistics came in on the bullet
that hit Gabrielle.

08:36.100 --> 08:39.230
It's a 9 mm. So we're probably
looking for a semi-automatic.

08:39.859 --> 08:42.164
Girl, what is wrong with you?
What are you doing?

08:42.199 --> 08:43.626
Oh, nothing. I just...

08:44.024 --> 08:46.164
Look, it's a ponytail headache.

08:46.199 --> 08:48.758
- Ponytail headache?
- Yeah, it's like when your...

08:48.793 --> 08:50.560
...hair is too tight.

08:50.595 --> 08:52.527
And it's fine now.

08:53.562 --> 08:54.593
- Okay.
- Okay.

08:54.628 --> 08:56.725
Well, uh, keep me posted.

08:56.760 --> 08:58.857
I mean, not about the hair.

08:58.892 --> 09:00.725
You can keep me posted
about the hair thing too,

09:00.760 --> 09:02.395
if you want to, um...

09:02.430 --> 09:05.494
but I meant about the...
well, the gun.

09:05.529 --> 09:07.329
So...
- Yeah.

09:07.364 --> 09:09.197
Okay, uh...

09:09.232 --> 09:11.824
Uh... Bye, Sam.
- Bye.

09:11.859 --> 09:13.725
This is... great.

09:16.463 --> 09:18.263
So, what's up between you two?

09:18.298 --> 09:20.131
Did you guys finally do the...

09:20.529 --> 09:25.065
You did, didn't you?!

09:25.100 --> 09:27.362
You finally dusted off
that beaver tail, huh?

09:27.397 --> 09:28.791
Let me see it. Let me see it.

09:28.826 --> 09:30.164
It's nothing.
It's well dusted, okay?

09:30.199 --> 09:31.791
It's a well-oiled pelt.
- Girl, please. That thing

09:31.826 --> 09:33.692
is dry as hell.
How many cobwebs you got?

09:33.727 --> 09:35.296
- None. No cobwebs.
- Let me count. One...

09:35.331 --> 09:37.065
Stop counting my vagina!
Don't count my vagina, please.

09:37.100 --> 09:38.593
I'm just saying.
You probably got a volleyball

09:38.628 --> 09:40.593
shoved up in there
with a face painted on it.

09:40.628 --> 09:41.989
And like Tom Hanks,
you're just so happy

09:42.024 --> 09:43.692
to have a human
interaction again.

09:43.727 --> 09:45.758
Okay, first of all, my vagina
is not a desert island,

09:45.793 --> 09:48.065
and also nothing happened.

09:49.331 --> 09:51.626
- Why not?
- Because!

09:54.232 --> 09:55.758
My mother walked in.

09:57.265 --> 09:58.692
Don't... Don't!

09:58.727 --> 10:00.626
I'm sorry, I thought you just
said your mother walked in,

10:00.661 --> 10:02.956
like you were in high school
or something. I'm sorry.

10:02.991 --> 10:04.362
Yeah, did you see him?

10:04.397 --> 10:05.725
So awkward.

10:05.760 --> 10:07.890
God, he's probably like,
turned off of me for like ever.

10:07.925 --> 10:08.758
Okay, so...

10:08.793 --> 10:10.032
Back it up for a second.
- Yeah?

10:10.067 --> 10:11.956
Why was your mother there
in the first place?

10:11.991 --> 10:13.494
Surprise bunionectomy!
It's really great.

10:13.529 --> 10:15.296
I'm super excited
to have a roommate

10:15.331 --> 10:16.362
for the next eight weeks.

10:16.397 --> 10:18.296
- Eight weeks?
- Eight weeks.

10:18.793 --> 10:21.758
Oh, your thing is definitely
gonna dry up now.

10:23.364 --> 10:25.758
Keegan's not answering.

10:27.298 --> 10:28.725
Hey!

10:29.298 --> 10:31.395
Richie, what's up?

10:32.595 --> 10:34.758
You've been staying
out of trouble, right?

10:35.430 --> 10:37.626
Yeah. You?

10:37.661 --> 10:39.527
Ah, I wish.

10:40.133 --> 10:42.791
But as you know, a friend
of ours got shot last night.

10:42.826 --> 10:45.164
So... if any of y'all
saw anything or heard anything,

10:45.199 --> 10:47.527
we could really use your help.
- Okay, guys, move it along!

10:47.562 --> 10:49.065
Richie, Dane, let's go.

10:49.892 --> 10:51.560
Now! Come on!

10:52.496 --> 10:55.197
Hey, Crystal, come on...

10:55.232 --> 10:56.395
I was talking to them.

10:56.430 --> 10:58.263
Well, they're not
talking to you.

10:58.298 --> 10:59.626
Okay, then.

10:59.661 --> 11:01.999
Has anyone asked you about
your whereabouts last night?

11:02.595 --> 11:04.197
So now you think
I shot that cop?

11:04.232 --> 11:05.659
No, I'm just asking.

11:05.958 --> 11:08.989
I've been trying to reach
Keegan. Were you with him?

11:09.024 --> 11:10.164
I was.

11:10.199 --> 11:13.461
And my sister and her husband,
out to dinner.

11:13.496 --> 11:15.890
With many witnesses
who could verify.

11:16.958 --> 11:18.791
Is there anything else
you wanna try to pin on us?

11:18.826 --> 11:21.164
You drank Keegan's Kool-Aid,
I get it.

11:21.694 --> 11:23.230
But if you really want
to know the facts,

11:23.265 --> 11:24.362
just gimme a call, okay?

11:24.397 --> 11:25.824
In the meantime,
can you tell the kids

11:25.859 --> 11:28.296
who live around here to be
a little bit more cooperative?

11:28.331 --> 11:29.692
Why would I do that?

11:29.727 --> 11:31.692
Because I don't think last
night's shooting was random.

11:31.727 --> 11:32.956
I think we were targeted.

11:32.991 --> 11:36.824
And these kids, Crystal,
might have seen something.

11:36.859 --> 11:38.725
Okay, well, you know what?
I don't have to drink

11:38.760 --> 11:40.989
anyone's Kool-Aid to know
that cooperating with the cops

11:41.024 --> 11:42.098
leads to trouble.

11:43.562 --> 11:45.758
Oh, and Keegan?

11:45.793 --> 11:47.494
Doesn't want to talk to you.

11:47.529 --> 11:49.560
Stop calling.

11:55.232 --> 11:57.197
Hey, you okay?

12:03.067 --> 12:04.857
Hey, uh...

12:05.595 --> 12:07.230
Give me a minute.

12:09.067 --> 12:10.362
Hey.

12:15.727 --> 12:17.560
If I tell you something,

12:17.595 --> 12:19.131
can you keep me out of it?

12:19.166 --> 12:20.131
And Crystal too.

12:20.166 --> 12:21.857
She don't got nothing
to do with this.

12:21.892 --> 12:23.791
Yeah, of course. Hey...

12:23.826 --> 12:26.032
I'm not gonna let anything
happen to you, okay?

12:26.067 --> 12:27.593
What is it?

12:28.760 --> 12:30.329
I think I know
where the gun is.

12:30.364 --> 12:32.593
The one that shot your friend.

12:33.595 --> 12:35.098
Okay.

12:38.364 --> 12:41.362
Are you sure that he said
it was this dumpster?

12:41.397 --> 12:42.725
Yes.

12:48.133 --> 12:50.692
Okay. Okay.

12:52.496 --> 12:54.032
Okay, okay, okay, okay!

12:54.067 --> 12:56.890
I swear to God, I swear to God
if this is a prank...

13:00.199 --> 13:02.362
Ah! Fart!

13:06.463 --> 13:07.527
- Got it!
- What?!

13:07.562 --> 13:09.065
Got it.

13:14.364 --> 13:16.362
Oh, my God.

13:16.397 --> 13:18.263
That's a ghost gun.

13:18.298 --> 13:19.692
Duff.

13:19.727 --> 13:21.923
It's 3-D printed.
- I know.

13:21.958 --> 13:24.428
No serial, untraceable.

13:24.760 --> 13:27.263
Perfect thing to use
if you wanna kill a cop...

13:27.661 --> 13:29.494
and get away with it.

13:36.628 --> 13:39.065
Looks like a toy,
but as you know,

13:39.100 --> 13:42.197
fires like a gun and inflicts
damage like a real gun.

13:42.925 --> 13:44.593
We discussed this.
You're not supposed

13:44.628 --> 13:46.032
to be looking
into this shooting.

13:46.067 --> 13:48.197
She's not. I am. It's just me.
I found the gun, all alone,

13:48.232 --> 13:49.692
knee-deep in garbage.
Can you smell me?

13:49.727 --> 13:50.758
Can you smell this?

13:50.793 --> 13:51.890
That is bad.
That's like, egg salad.

13:51.925 --> 13:53.725
Oh my gosh, that's a diaper.

13:53.760 --> 13:54.923
Get your hand outta my face.

13:54.958 --> 13:56.428
How'd you know the gun
was in the trash?

13:56.463 --> 13:58.857
My source disposed of it
after finding it in the alley.

13:58.892 --> 14:00.857
- Why?
- So it wouldn't be used again.

14:00.892 --> 14:02.494
What a Good Samaritan!
Who's your source?

14:02.529 --> 14:05.098
She would rather not say.
Isn't that right, Wazowski?

14:05.133 --> 14:06.956
That's exactly right,
but what I can tell you

14:06.991 --> 14:08.857
is that forensics found
two sets of prints.

14:08.892 --> 14:10.494
The one on the outside
of the gun belongs

14:10.529 --> 14:12.659
to the source, on the inside,
to an unknown person.

14:12.694 --> 14:14.659
- No AFIS matches?
- No. Nothing in the system.

14:14.694 --> 14:16.230
But we think they belong
to the manufacturer,

14:16.265 --> 14:18.758
which is why I'm gonna
find who the manufacturer is,

14:18.793 --> 14:20.164
and find out
who they sold the gun to.

14:20.199 --> 14:22.725
And voila.
We have Gabrielle's shooter.

14:22.760 --> 14:25.197
Yeah. And by "we"
she means me. Two peas in a pod.

14:25.232 --> 14:27.296
Or you could just pull in
your source and ask them.

14:27.331 --> 14:30.065
Pull in anyone who was
in the area for questioning.

14:30.100 --> 14:32.296
And fingerprint an entire
neighbourhood

14:32.331 --> 14:34.593
until we find a match? No!

14:34.628 --> 14:36.527
Shanks, guys,

14:36.562 --> 14:37.923
we're already treating
this community

14:37.958 --> 14:38.956
like they're a bunch
of criminals.

14:38.991 --> 14:40.395
If we start accusing them,

14:40.430 --> 14:41.923
it's only going to make our
relationship with them worse.

14:41.958 --> 14:44.098
This is a cop shooting.
We have a job to do.

14:44.133 --> 14:45.593
We can't be afraid
to step on toes.

14:45.628 --> 14:46.923
I agree with Kelly.

14:46.958 --> 14:48.791
We shouldn't cast a net.
We should be more targeted.

14:48.826 --> 14:51.659
Give Wazowski,
and only Wazowski,

14:51.694 --> 14:53.263
a beat to find the gunmaker.

14:53.298 --> 14:55.065
She's right. We find them,
we find the shooter.

14:55.100 --> 14:57.263
I'm sorry, you hired me
to get this department in shape

14:57.298 --> 14:59.263
and you're trusting this
to someone who smells

14:59.298 --> 15:00.857
like sweaty cold cuts.

15:01.232 --> 15:02.395
Brad.

15:03.199 --> 15:04.132
Here's a beat.

15:04.167 --> 15:07.362
But in 24 hours,
I'm doing this my way. Okay?

15:10.430 --> 15:13.131
That does smell like salami.
It does, it's really bad.

15:14.232 --> 15:16.197
You need to change.

15:16.232 --> 15:17.296
Okay, great.

15:17.331 --> 15:19.593
And you're sure
that's what he ordered?

15:19.628 --> 15:22.296
Right. Okay, thank you.

15:22.331 --> 15:24.131
Thank you very much.

15:24.628 --> 15:26.659
I got something.
I got something.

15:27.331 --> 15:30.032
Okay, okay, do you remember
how the forensics report

15:30.067 --> 15:31.758
said that the gun barrel
and the butt were made

15:31.793 --> 15:33.593
of the same heat-resistant
ABS plastic?

15:33.628 --> 15:35.296
- Like Legos.
- Yeah. Well, it turns out

15:35.331 --> 15:37.626
that the trigger assembly

15:37.661 --> 15:39.428
A biocompatible
polyurethane resin.

15:39.463 --> 15:40.857
In specific, a proprietary brand

15:40.892 --> 15:42.923
called Actinate
by Sendyne Polymers.

15:43.595 --> 15:45.032
- So?
- Okay, okay.

15:45.067 --> 15:47.659
So, Actinate is used
to make dental aligners.

15:47.694 --> 15:50.494
And it turns out that Sendyne...

15:50.529 --> 15:52.164
only sells that specific polymer

15:52.199 --> 15:53.758
to three orthodontists
in the city,

15:53.793 --> 15:55.032
and one of them,
Dr. John Bockner,

15:55.067 --> 15:56.395
at Blueline Orthodontics,

15:56.430 --> 15:57.593
was buying an excess amount,

15:57.628 --> 15:59.296
considering the number
of clients he has.

16:00.991 --> 16:02.362
I wonder what he's using
all that plastic for.

16:02.397 --> 16:04.560
- Yeah.
- Alright. Looks like one of us

16:04.595 --> 16:06.230
is gonna have to go in
for a consult.

16:06.265 --> 16:07.428
Yeah, I wonder who.

16:07.463 --> 16:08.560
Not it.

16:08.595 --> 16:09.923
Yeah, that's you.

16:10.793 --> 16:12.263
I said
I wasn't it.

16:12.298 --> 16:13.956
I did. I said, "Not it!"

16:13.991 --> 16:15.956
How does that make me it?

16:16.529 --> 16:18.065
Oh, God.

16:18.100 --> 16:20.494
Oh, I hate the orthodontist.

16:20.991 --> 16:23.164
Didn't you already
have braces?

16:23.760 --> 16:24.890
<i>This should be a cinch.</i>

16:31.199 --> 16:32.593
Oh...

16:38.562 --> 16:39.956
Hey.

16:39.991 --> 16:41.395
What's up?

16:41.430 --> 16:43.758
Can I ask you something?
Shoot.

16:43.793 --> 16:46.263
Do you think Naz
is like, too hot for me?

16:46.826 --> 16:48.692
<i>Like, he's too cool?</i>

16:48.727 --> 16:51.395
"Cool" is not how
I would describe Naz.

16:51.430 --> 16:52.560
How would you describe...

16:52.595 --> 16:54.999
- Samantha?
- Yeah, that's me.

16:59.265 --> 17:03.461
So, what do you think?

17:03.496 --> 17:05.461
Well, you had braces as a kid.

17:05.496 --> 17:07.395
And your retainer didn't work.

17:07.991 --> 17:10.098
So we'd just be correcting
some drifts.

17:10.133 --> 17:12.857
<i>Some rotation, angulation.</i>

17:13.496 --> 17:14.692
<i>You wanna see how you'd look?</i>

17:14.727 --> 17:16.329
I could take a few pictures
and show you.

17:16.364 --> 17:17.296
Oh, uh...

17:17.331 --> 17:19.362
Yeah, sure.
- I'll just grab the camera.

17:24.562 --> 17:25.890
Oh, wow, okay.

17:25.925 --> 17:27.560
<i>This thing is obtrusive.</i>

17:27.595 --> 17:29.527
Uh, ask about his colleagues.

17:30.199 --> 17:33.065
Oh, you orthodontists
must be really busy,

17:33.100 --> 17:35.989
just like, running a practice,

17:36.024 --> 17:37.923
and then all
the administrative stuff...

17:37.958 --> 17:40.989
My daughter handles
the administrative stuff.

17:41.024 --> 17:43.692
Oh, yeah. What does she do?

17:43.727 --> 17:46.527
Schedules appointments,
orders supplies,

17:46.562 --> 17:47.857
<i>that sort of thing.</i>

17:47.892 --> 17:50.725
Oh, supplies,
like, for the printer?

17:50.760 --> 17:53.791
I saw them out there. I thought
all aligners were factory-made?

17:53.826 --> 17:57.098
But you make yours in-house?
- We do now.

17:57.133 --> 18:00.131
<i>Actually, my daughter, Vicky,
set up the 3-D printer for us.</i>

18:00.166 --> 18:01.461
<i>It's so much faster.</i>

18:01.496 --> 18:03.197
Oh, wow,
that's fantastic.

18:03.232 --> 18:05.725
All that tech stuff is really
just such a mystery to me.

18:05.760 --> 18:07.131
How does she know
so much about it?

18:07.166 --> 18:09.791
She went
to Engineering school...

18:09.826 --> 18:11.527
<i>- Oh.
- ...for a while.</i>

18:11.562 --> 18:13.098
Oh, right.

18:13.793 --> 18:16.197
What... Not anymore?

18:17.232 --> 18:18.263
Oh...

18:19.694 --> 18:21.857
You know, I'm... I'm so sorry.

18:21.892 --> 18:24.164
I don't mean to pry.
- It's okay.

18:24.199 --> 18:27.164
Uh, she had to leave.
Ran into some problems.

18:27.199 --> 18:29.626
<i>I'm trying to get her
interested in dentistry.</i>

18:30.331 --> 18:31.956
Find out more
about Miss Vicky.

18:31.991 --> 18:33.791
I think I see her
coming in right now.

18:34.562 --> 18:36.131
God, I know
all about problems.

18:36.166 --> 18:38.197
I have a teenage son.
He can be a handful.

18:38.232 --> 18:40.362
Girls are so much easier.
I mean, not to diminish, like,

18:40.397 --> 18:41.626
what's happening
with you and your daughter.

18:41.661 --> 18:45.197
Anyway, enough about me.
This... is the new you

18:45.232 --> 18:46.626
in 20 weeks.

18:46.661 --> 18:47.791
Oh, wow.

18:47.826 --> 18:49.164
I could even accelerate
the transformation

18:49.199 --> 18:51.164
if you use this device
to help with circulation.

18:51.199 --> 18:53.593
You just stick it
in your mouth twice a day

18:53.628 --> 18:54.725
while you're watching TV.

18:54.760 --> 18:57.626
Right, okay.
Uh, that's... that's fine.

18:57.661 --> 18:58.791
Let me know what you decide.

18:58.826 --> 18:59.956
You can book your impressions
with Vicky.

18:59.991 --> 19:01.527
Okay, thanks.

19:06.397 --> 19:09.626
Hi, um, could I have
a toothbrush? One of those?

19:09.661 --> 19:11.230
Yeah, sure.

19:13.562 --> 19:15.065
Thank you.

19:19.892 --> 19:23.230
Got you, Vicky,
you devious little turd.

19:23.265 --> 19:25.098
I can't believe your dad
gives you a second chance

19:25.133 --> 19:26.395
and you make guns?

19:26.430 --> 19:29.032
Well, at least we know
she didn't pull the trigger.

19:29.067 --> 19:30.659
Unless she can eat
ribs across town

19:30.694 --> 19:32.758
and shoot cops
at the same time.

19:32.793 --> 19:34.263
Alright, then,
why don't we pick her up

19:34.298 --> 19:36.131
and find out who did?
- No, let's wait.

19:36.166 --> 19:36.932
Why?

19:36.967 --> 19:38.329
One fingerprint
isn't gonna prove

19:38.364 --> 19:39.923
that she's manufacturing
these things.

19:39.958 --> 19:41.197
- Mmm.
- Between her alibi

19:41.232 --> 19:42.956
and a good lawyer,
she's gonna be out in an hour,

19:42.991 --> 19:44.593
and we're never gonna find out
who the shooter is.

19:44.628 --> 19:47.197
Alright, so we get a tracking
warrant for her phone.

19:47.232 --> 19:49.890
Get solid proof that she's been
manufacturing and selling.

19:49.925 --> 19:51.263
Yes! And then, we pull out

19:51.298 --> 19:53.824
our patented
Skelly one-two punch...

19:55.958 --> 19:57.659
And then, we're gonna
get her to roll over

19:57.694 --> 19:58.824
on whoever bought it.

19:58.859 --> 20:00.395
Yes!
- Excuse me. Skelly?

20:00.430 --> 20:01.626
Skelly.

20:01.661 --> 20:03.428
Well, we could say "Kam".

20:03.463 --> 20:05.956
But I really don't feel
it has a zing.

20:05.991 --> 20:07.197
Yeah, I'll be there
in five.

20:07.232 --> 20:09.362
Okay, I've got her location
tracking up.

20:09.397 --> 20:11.164
So far, she's been to a gym,
a nail salon,

20:11.199 --> 20:12.692
and a tanning salon.

20:12.727 --> 20:14.692
It's like Jersey Shore
over here.

20:16.958 --> 20:18.197
Marc, hey.

20:18.232 --> 20:20.725
Hey.
I need 10 of your best.

20:20.760 --> 20:21.791
<i>Can you make that happen?</i>

20:23.595 --> 20:27.230
<i>Fine, I can do 10,
- but it's gonna be 2
- K each.</i>

20:27.265 --> 20:29.824
- She's making a deal.
- 20
- K?! Nah.

20:29.859 --> 20:31.494
<i>How about 10?
Shark...</i>

20:31.529 --> 20:33.329
Who the hell is Shark?
Price is 20.

20:33.364 --> 20:35.263
- Can you get the number?
- Uh, no.

20:35.298 --> 20:36.725
It must be a sat phone.
- Wait, she said...

20:36.760 --> 20:38.395
Meet me at
your Wednesday spot. 10 a.m.

20:38.430 --> 20:41.263
Marc, right?
Marc "The Shark" Tremblay.

20:41.298 --> 20:42.989
One of the Sons of Jupiter.

20:43.024 --> 20:44.857
So, Vicky's selling guns
to bikers now.

20:44.892 --> 20:46.428
I know that guy.

20:46.463 --> 20:48.362
One of his biker boys
got popped on Cherry Beach,

20:48.397 --> 20:52.098
Marc was the prime suspect.
- Oh, no. Oh, God.

20:52.133 --> 20:54.527
Guess which homicide
detectives investigated him?

21:21.991 --> 21:25.494
So... to what do we owe
this very impromptu,

21:25.529 --> 21:27.032
disruptive visit?

21:27.067 --> 21:29.296
It's about
Gabrielle's shooter.

21:29.694 --> 21:31.164
Sergeant Gabrielle Beauchamp?

21:31.199 --> 21:32.791
She works in 44?
She was shot.

21:32.826 --> 21:34.395
- Dead?
- Nope, not dead.

21:34.430 --> 21:36.758
- Then it's not our problem.
- Geez, come...

21:36.793 --> 21:38.999
Okay. Um...

21:41.661 --> 21:45.164
Okay, what do you know
about Marc "The Shark" Tremblay?

21:45.199 --> 21:48.890
He's a dangerous guy.
Not to mention, a beast.

21:48.925 --> 21:50.428
Like, physically.

21:50.463 --> 21:54.395
Are you sure
that we're talking about
the same guy, 'cause...

21:55.265 --> 21:57.197
He was puny when we first
looked at him,

21:57.232 --> 22:01.659
but then, as our
investigation progressed,
so did his mass.

22:01.694 --> 22:04.395
He gained 10 pounds
of lean muscle every month.
It was incredible.

22:04.430 --> 22:06.098
Yeah, now even his hands
have muscles.

22:06.133 --> 22:07.824
- All hands have muscles.
- Not Chase's.

22:07.859 --> 22:10.461
Look. See? No muscle.

22:10.496 --> 22:13.329
That is actually...
That's a bit...

22:13.364 --> 22:15.032
Okay, can we get back
to Marc, please?

22:15.067 --> 22:16.923
Yes, uh, we just need to know

22:16.958 --> 22:18.230
what he does
on a Wednesday morning.

22:18.265 --> 22:21.065
If I'm reading you right,
he is a... he's a gym rat.

22:21.100 --> 22:22.560
Probably hangs out there a lot?

22:22.595 --> 22:24.461
Maybe he goes there
on Wednesdays?

22:25.298 --> 22:27.329
I don't think we know, do we?

22:27.364 --> 22:30.329
No, we definitely don't know
anything about his schedule.

22:30.364 --> 22:32.362
Or his work.
Or his favourite food.

22:32.397 --> 22:34.131
Hint, it's boiled chicken.

22:34.166 --> 22:36.461
I tried his diet.
It was crazy.

22:36.496 --> 22:38.329
- He got protein poisoning.
- That's not a thing.

22:38.364 --> 22:39.824
It's a thing,
he was very sick.

22:39.859 --> 22:40.956
You tried his workouts?

22:40.991 --> 22:43.263
I bet he didn't.
Couldn't hack it.

22:43.298 --> 22:46.098
Chase definitely tried
his workouts.

22:46.133 --> 22:48.362
Uh, yeah. I even spent $500

22:48.397 --> 22:50.263
on four personal training
sessions at Marc's gym.

22:50.298 --> 22:53.098
Wow. That was overpriced.
Someone ripped you off.

22:53.133 --> 22:54.890
- It's standard.
- Nope!

22:54.925 --> 22:56.362
My gym charges
60 bucks a session.

22:56.397 --> 22:58.230
Well, you obviously don't
workout at Cyrus Gym.

22:58.265 --> 23:01.098
- Oh!
- Oh! Wazowski!

23:01.133 --> 23:02.527
What do you know?!

23:02.562 --> 23:04.494
Looks like we're going
to Cyrus Gym tomorrow!

23:04.529 --> 23:06.725
I would like to thank you
both very much

23:06.760 --> 23:08.098
for your cooperation.

23:08.133 --> 23:10.197
It was lovely chatting with you.

23:20.298 --> 23:22.527
Hey.
Hey, I'm sorry I'm late.

23:22.562 --> 23:24.263
Sorry I'm late, 'cause my mom,
you won't believe it--

23:24.298 --> 23:26.395
- What are you wearing?
- Workout clothes.

23:26.430 --> 23:28.659
My God, you look
like a popsicle.

23:29.024 --> 23:32.098
- I do?
- Yes. Stay back, stay back.

23:32.133 --> 23:33.461
Stay back.

23:33.496 --> 23:35.032
I don't want
to be seen with you.

23:35.067 --> 23:36.131
Like a grape one?

23:36.166 --> 23:37.527
You go that way,
I'mma go this way.

23:37.562 --> 23:39.131
- I hope it's strawberry.
- Ugh.

23:45.958 --> 23:47.989
I don't see him,
do you?

23:48.024 --> 23:51.263
No. He's not here.

23:52.793 --> 23:55.230
You think I can do more squats
than her? Check this out.

23:55.265 --> 23:57.197
Hey, do you mind if I...?

23:57.232 --> 23:58.428
No, go ahead.

24:00.595 --> 24:02.824
Yeah, only 'cause
your outfit scared her away
from the equipment.

24:02.859 --> 24:05.461
Seriously, I can't believe
you spent money on that thing.

24:05.496 --> 24:07.428
Yes, I did. I paid a lot
of money, like two...

24:07.463 --> 24:09.791
...two hundred dollars.

24:10.595 --> 24:11.791
How's my form?

24:13.859 --> 24:14.857
Duff.

24:16.166 --> 24:17.758
<i>Is that him?</i>

24:18.199 --> 24:21.065
I don't know.
Let me get a closer look.

24:21.100 --> 24:23.824
Alright, I'm confirming
that it's him.

24:23.859 --> 24:27.560
Well, it is 10 a.m.,
so one of them's gotta be him.

24:28.265 --> 24:31.923
But if you see Vicky,
do not let her see you.

24:31.958 --> 24:33.659
I won't.

24:40.430 --> 24:42.890
Hey, Marc, looking good.

24:47.067 --> 24:49.362
Yup, that's him.

24:49.397 --> 24:50.824
Alright, I'm going in.

24:54.024 --> 24:58.296
Hey, do you mind if I work in
with you while you rest?

24:58.331 --> 25:01.263
Sure, if I can spot you.

25:01.298 --> 25:04.956
Be my guest.
I'm Kelly, by the way.

25:04.991 --> 25:07.956
Marc. Friends call me Shark.

25:18.100 --> 25:20.296
Oh, wow, you're really strong.

25:20.331 --> 25:22.857
I've never seen you
around the gym before.

25:22.892 --> 25:26.230
Ah, I'm looking for a new gym.

25:26.760 --> 25:29.692
Well, if you need a trainer,
I got the best one in the city.

25:31.892 --> 25:35.296
Nah! No way!

25:35.925 --> 25:37.362
Kelly Marie?

25:38.166 --> 25:40.659
Come here, girl!
Give me a hug!

25:41.265 --> 25:44.626
Hey...

25:45.628 --> 25:48.527
I'm undercover,
alright? Do not blow this.

25:48.562 --> 25:50.890
Ditto, and he's my mark.

25:51.958 --> 25:54.890
God, you look good!
- Wow.

25:55.430 --> 25:57.065
I'm guessing you two
know each other?

25:57.100 --> 25:58.890
Yeah, he used
to train me.

25:59.397 --> 26:01.395
Took a lot of years
to undo his bad habits,

26:01.430 --> 26:03.362
but maybe he's changed.

26:03.793 --> 26:07.230
Ask this guy.
All good habits now.

26:12.463 --> 26:14.527
I gotta go
and handle something.

26:16.991 --> 26:18.197
Hey.

26:18.628 --> 26:21.890
Uh, Shark.
We gotta leave, now.

26:21.925 --> 26:23.791
Something doesn't feel right.

26:24.958 --> 26:27.659
Duff, who's that guy?

26:28.166 --> 26:31.263
It's my ex-boyfriend, Len.

26:32.397 --> 26:35.494
Len? Like, Beretta Len, Len?

26:35.529 --> 26:38.164
What's he doing with Marc?
- I don't know.

26:39.166 --> 26:42.527
But if he's working
an undercover case,
he shouldn't.

26:42.562 --> 26:44.527
Last time he went UC,
it was disastrous.

26:44.562 --> 26:47.362
God, that guy's easy to spook.

26:47.397 --> 26:50.032
Makes my job easier.
- Excuse me?

26:50.067 --> 26:51.659
What are you doing here?

26:51.694 --> 26:53.725
What does it look
like I'm doing?

26:53.760 --> 26:56.560
I told Marc I had to change,
so we got two minutes

26:56.595 --> 26:58.725
to talk about why you're trying
to bust up my op.

26:58.760 --> 27:00.626
- Your op?
- Hey, wow. No thanks!

27:00.661 --> 27:02.131
Okay, that's gonna happen!

27:02.166 --> 27:04.230
Listen, I draw the line at
the shoes, the shoes stay on.

27:04.265 --> 27:05.461
No bare feet in the car.

27:05.496 --> 27:07.758
You ever try taking
shorts off over kicks?

27:07.793 --> 27:09.296
Doesn't work.

27:09.331 --> 27:10.791
I'm Len, by the way.

27:10.826 --> 27:13.164
Detective Samantha Wazowski,
Guns and Gangs.

27:13.199 --> 27:14.890
Please exit the vehicle.

27:14.925 --> 27:17.626
Nice to meet you.
Do you always talk like
you're at a stop and frisk?

27:17.661 --> 27:19.395
Why are you looking into
Marc Tremblay?

27:19.430 --> 27:21.527
'Cause he's at the centre
of my case.

27:22.100 --> 27:23.395
Big one.

27:23.958 --> 27:25.494
My turn.

27:26.100 --> 27:28.362
Why you blocking my number?

27:28.925 --> 27:30.428
You know why.

27:31.463 --> 27:32.857
Tell me about
your investigation.

27:32.892 --> 27:36.065
All I can say is I'm working
with RCMP. Project Voltage.

27:36.100 --> 27:39.230
Been embedded for two months.
The rest is classified.

27:39.265 --> 27:41.098
You're investigating
Sons of Jupiter?

27:41.133 --> 27:43.593
- Are you?
- We want Vicky.

27:43.628 --> 27:45.989
A gun she made
nearly killed a cop.

27:46.024 --> 27:48.857
I heard about that.
You were there, right?

27:49.364 --> 27:50.560
You okay?

27:52.430 --> 27:54.791
You haven't slept.
- I'm fine.

27:54.826 --> 27:58.164
I just need to find Vicky,
and find out who she sold to.

27:58.199 --> 28:00.131
Okay, okay, okay.

28:00.166 --> 28:01.824
How about...

28:03.496 --> 28:06.824
I step in for Marc,
meet Vicky, finish the deal.

28:06.859 --> 28:09.263
You make your arrest,
and I keep Marc in the clear.

28:09.298 --> 28:11.329
And why would we
trust you with this?

28:12.331 --> 28:14.461
Do you have another option?

28:15.199 --> 28:17.461
Look, Marc's spooked.

28:17.496 --> 28:20.428
Do this with me,
or don't do it at all.

28:21.496 --> 28:24.362
So, get the cash, call me,

28:24.397 --> 28:26.890
and we'll get this
done today. Okay?

28:30.294 --> 28:33.626
But you're gonna have
to unblock me if you want me
to call you back.

28:38.892 --> 28:41.098
Duff... We can't.

28:41.133 --> 28:42.362
- I know.
- We can't.

28:42.397 --> 28:43.791
There's no way
I'm working with him.

28:43.826 --> 28:46.626
I mean, who does
he think he is anyway?

28:47.463 --> 28:49.890
"Unblock me."

28:53.133 --> 28:55.362
We may have lost Marc,
but Vicky will sell again.

28:55.397 --> 28:57.131
We'll just keep monitoring
her phone, and--

28:57.166 --> 28:58.527
Duff, that's gonna
take a while.

28:58.562 --> 29:00.428
I... Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What the hell?

29:00.463 --> 29:01.923
Hey! Hey!

29:01.958 --> 29:04.197
What are you doing?
- Sorry, Duff. DS orders.

29:04.232 --> 29:07.164
You're a liar!
You said you wouldn't tell!
I didn't do anything!

29:07.199 --> 29:11.131
I know. Wait! I'mma handle
this, Richie! I promise!

29:15.694 --> 29:18.131
What is this?
You said that we had time.

29:18.166 --> 29:20.857
Well, your time is up. So,
I'm gonna question your source.

29:20.892 --> 29:22.527
How did you even
find out about him?

29:22.562 --> 29:24.725
You're not the only person
in this office who has access

29:24.760 --> 29:26.395
to Marshall Court
security footage,

29:26.430 --> 29:27.527
and I saw you talking to him

29:27.562 --> 29:28.659
yesterday before you
and Wazowski

29:28.694 --> 29:30.131
went head first
into a dumpster.

29:30.166 --> 29:31.395
Oh, so now
you're spying on us?

29:31.430 --> 29:34.395
Okay. Can you not
make me the bad guy here?

29:34.430 --> 29:36.197
You're holding back an important
piece of the puzzle.

29:36.232 --> 29:37.659
I had to get it myself.

29:37.694 --> 29:39.692
Thankfully, I didn't have
to roll around in garbage
to do so.

29:39.727 --> 29:41.032
Oh, God forbid, you know,

29:41.067 --> 29:42.494
'cause you wouldn't want
to ruin your outfit.

29:42.529 --> 29:44.329
What makes you even think
Richie did this?

29:44.892 --> 29:47.296
His fingerprints
are all over the gun.

29:47.331 --> 29:50.560
You can't be so naïve
to assume he had nothing
to do with it.

29:50.595 --> 29:53.131
Naïve? We're actually
doing the work.

29:53.166 --> 29:55.098
We're on the brink of finding
out who bought the gun.

29:55.133 --> 29:57.758
I only care about the shooter.
And now I have him.

29:57.793 --> 30:00.890
And now, maybe Sergeant
Beauchamp can get some justice.

30:00.925 --> 30:01.691
Remember her?

30:01.726 --> 30:04.131
Listen, this kid
didn't do it.

30:04.595 --> 30:07.428
Good. Prove it.

30:15.727 --> 30:17.791
Remember what I said
about not using Len?

30:17.826 --> 30:21.527
- No take-backs.
- Yes! Take-backs.

30:22.166 --> 30:23.560
It's the only way to catch Vicky

30:23.595 --> 30:26.032
before this ass-hat
ruins Richie's life.

30:32.496 --> 30:33.626
<i>We got your prints...</i>

30:33.661 --> 30:35.692
I just wrote
a very short description

30:35.727 --> 30:37.329
of what we're going
to ask for in there.

30:37.364 --> 30:38.362
It's a quick read.

30:38.397 --> 30:39.593
Listen, just take my lead,
alright?

30:39.628 --> 30:41.923
She listens to me
better than you. Alright?

30:41.958 --> 30:43.091
Let's go.

30:43.126 --> 30:46.296
I will keep you
posted. Okay, thank you, bye.

30:46.331 --> 30:49.032
The superintendent
is having a conniption

30:49.067 --> 30:50.329
over this shooting.

30:50.364 --> 30:51.857
Please tell me you
have some answers.

30:51.892 --> 30:55.758
We might, but it'll take
a little investment
from our part.

30:55.793 --> 30:56.857
Mm-hmm?

30:58.529 --> 31:00.626
Twenty thousand dollars
from the flash fund.

31:00.661 --> 31:04.098
Twenty thousand dollars?!
For what?

31:04.133 --> 31:06.692
Uh, that's how much
Vicky Bockner needs

31:06.727 --> 31:07.890
for 10 of her ghost guns.

31:07.925 --> 31:09.725
And you can't push
for a smaller buy?

31:09.760 --> 31:11.857
No. We have to match the deal
with the original buyer.

31:11.892 --> 31:13.626
It'll look weird
if we reduce the order.

31:13.661 --> 31:16.593
But look, she's ready
to move on this today

31:16.628 --> 31:19.692
with an... associate of ours.

31:20.232 --> 31:21.362
Associate?

31:23.991 --> 31:25.494
Len Grierson.

31:26.166 --> 31:27.659
Len, Len?

31:27.694 --> 31:29.890
Are you sure about this?

31:30.364 --> 31:32.230
Well, he knows Vicky
through Marc,

31:32.265 --> 31:33.791
who he's investigating.

31:33.826 --> 31:37.032
Something about a Project
Voltage. It's an RCMP thing.

31:37.067 --> 31:37.899
Okay...

31:37.935 --> 31:39.626
We already checked into it,
and I...

31:39.661 --> 31:41.758
I just took the liberty
of filling out

31:41.793 --> 31:44.626
the, um... the flash fund form.

31:45.496 --> 31:47.857
Yeah, and I...

31:47.892 --> 31:50.461
took the liberty
of providing a pen.

31:53.397 --> 31:56.527
Like... she's ready to go.
- Wait!

31:57.024 --> 31:58.791
But she's waiting now.

31:59.760 --> 32:01.890
Time is running out.

32:10.892 --> 32:11.791
Thank you.

32:17.298 --> 32:20.659
Okay.
- Target's here.

32:21.496 --> 32:23.527
Here you go.

32:25.397 --> 32:28.494
- Testing.
- Alright, I got you.

32:29.166 --> 32:30.791
I know you do.

32:31.562 --> 32:33.824
Meet me in the alley
after the buy.

32:49.463 --> 32:52.032
So,
Marc couldn't be here.

32:52.067 --> 32:53.824
Don't care.

32:55.694 --> 32:57.428
<i>So you got the cash?</i>

32:57.463 --> 32:58.626
<i>Hand it over.</i>

32:59.991 --> 33:02.461
<i>Not until I see you assemble
one of these guns.</i>

33:02.496 --> 33:05.164
<i>Why? Marc has
the instructions.</i>

33:05.199 --> 33:06.365
What is he doing?

33:06.400 --> 33:08.593
Well, I want to make sue
that everything's there,

33:08.628 --> 33:10.461
<i>you're not ripping us off.</i>

33:10.496 --> 33:14.263
<i>Put it together, load it,
or I walk.</i>

33:14.298 --> 33:16.692
Should we go over?
I can't see anything. Len!

33:16.727 --> 33:18.527
Len, you gotta move over.

33:18.562 --> 33:22.560
Will you stop bugging him?
He'll move, alright?

33:22.595 --> 33:24.032
Just let him do his thing.

33:24.067 --> 33:25.362
What are you
looking at?

33:25.397 --> 33:26.593
That's what I'd like to know.

33:26.628 --> 33:27.758
You can never be
too careful.

33:27.793 --> 33:29.999
Yeah,
whatever you say. Here.

33:31.331 --> 33:32.890
<i>Give me the money.</i>

33:33.892 --> 33:35.956
I'll give you 10 grand.
No more.

33:35.991 --> 33:37.857
That wasn't the deal.

33:37.892 --> 33:40.890
Well, that was the deal
you had with Marc this morning.

33:41.727 --> 33:43.956
<i>Now he wants you to reconsider.
Whoa. Hey, man.</i>

33:43.991 --> 33:46.593
<i>Take it easy!
- Take it or leave it.</i>

33:47.024 --> 33:47.989
<i>Fine...</i>

33:48.024 --> 33:49.461
Len,
what are you doing?

33:49.496 --> 33:50.989
You had your chance.

33:51.024 --> 33:52.857
- No! Hey!
- What the hell is he doing?!

33:52.892 --> 33:55.164
Don't do this to me again!

33:55.199 --> 33:58.692
No, stop! Len, stop!

33:59.529 --> 34:03.098
No!
- I got her! Get the buyer!

34:03.133 --> 34:06.098
Len! Stop! Argh!

34:16.133 --> 34:19.032
So, you don't have
the guns you think my client
manufactured.

34:19.067 --> 34:21.296
You don't have the money
you said she received
for these guns.

34:21.331 --> 34:23.857
It's only a matter of time
before we apprehend the buyer,
who has both.

34:23.892 --> 34:25.923
And your client here will be
arrested for manufacturing

34:25.958 --> 34:28.395
10 prohibited firearms.
- It's eleven, actually.

34:28.430 --> 34:30.890
Another gun you made
shot a cop in Marshall Court.

34:30.925 --> 34:32.593
You fingerprints are on it.

34:32.628 --> 34:36.098
Listen, Vicky. We know
you tried to sell to Marc,
and to his associate.

34:36.133 --> 34:38.428
But I'm not interested
in those guns.

34:38.463 --> 34:41.494
We can work out a deal
if you tell us who
you sold this gun to.

34:41.529 --> 34:44.560
- I didn't--
- Tell us, Vicky!

34:44.595 --> 34:46.362
Or you'll be charged
as an accessory

34:46.397 --> 34:48.428
in the attempted murder
of a cop.

34:55.694 --> 34:58.065
I didn't sell a gun
to anyone in Marshall Court.

34:58.100 --> 35:00.527
I only ever sold to Marc.
I swear.

35:01.166 --> 35:02.692
If a gun got
into Marshall Court,

35:02.727 --> 35:03.923
it was through Marc Tremblay.

35:03.958 --> 35:06.065
He must have brokered the deal.

35:10.298 --> 35:12.131
Len, where are you?

35:12.166 --> 35:14.131
I need you to call me back
right now!

35:14.166 --> 35:16.395
Kelly. Len's gone.
He played us.

35:16.430 --> 35:18.065
No, he didn't.
He's an ass,

35:18.100 --> 35:20.263
and he plays by his own rules,
but he's a good cop.

35:20.298 --> 35:21.564
Are you sure about that?

35:21.600 --> 35:25.032
I decided to look
a little further into
this Project Voltage

35:25.067 --> 35:27.527
that your boy Len is
involved with. And guess what?

35:27.562 --> 35:29.956
It is an RCMP investigation...

35:29.991 --> 35:33.527
into stolen copper wire
with a connection
to the Russian Mafia

35:33.562 --> 35:35.230
that was wrapped up
five years ago!

35:35.265 --> 35:37.065
How did you find that out?
That project was classified.

35:37.100 --> 35:39.164
What can I say,
I have friends in high places.

35:39.199 --> 35:41.032
Unfortunately, I can't say
the same thing for Len,

35:41.067 --> 35:43.230
because it turns out he's not
even on the force right now!

35:43.265 --> 35:45.131
Yeah, because
he's working for the RCMP!

35:45.166 --> 35:49.923
No, because he's registered
at a rehab in Burlington.

35:51.265 --> 35:53.230
You two had better find
that money,

35:53.265 --> 35:55.659
or you will never
work undercover again.

35:55.694 --> 35:57.527
It's okay, we're on it.

36:00.727 --> 36:02.890
We swabbed
Richie's hoodie for GSR.

36:02.925 --> 36:05.395
It came back positive.
- It's a misunderstanding.

36:05.430 --> 36:08.791
Listen, those kids over there,
they play this stupid game
with fireworks.

36:08.826 --> 36:10.098
He's probably covered
in residue,

36:10.133 --> 36:11.857
it can look exactly
the same as gunshot particles.

36:11.892 --> 36:14.857
He doesn't have an alibi,
and he knew exactly where
the weapon was hidden.

36:14.892 --> 36:16.956
Then why would he
tell us about it? Huh?

36:16.991 --> 36:19.989
His prints were all over
that gun, he's not that stupid!

36:20.024 --> 36:21.659
Lots of people
are that stupid.

36:21.694 --> 36:23.395
You're a cop.
You should know that by now.

36:24.067 --> 36:26.329
Or maybe he's not stupid at all,

36:26.364 --> 36:28.131
and he just grew a conscience.

36:28.760 --> 36:30.999
I hear that happens.

36:38.100 --> 36:39.263
Duff?

36:41.826 --> 36:44.131
Hey, Duff, you want
to talk about this?

36:46.562 --> 36:48.428
No, I don't want to talk.

36:54.364 --> 36:55.824
Goodnight, Sam.

37:02.628 --> 37:06.395
<i>♪ Don't ask me where to
I don't know where ♪</i>

37:06.430 --> 37:07.791
- Hey.
- Hey.

37:07.826 --> 37:10.362
Um... You've been
avoiding me today.

37:10.397 --> 37:11.659
Oh, no. Oh gosh, no.

37:11.694 --> 37:13.758
I thought that you
were avoiding me.

37:15.133 --> 37:16.296
Come here.

37:19.265 --> 37:20.890
It's quiet in here.

37:20.925 --> 37:23.164
Yeah, yeah.
It's kinda nice, right?

37:23.199 --> 37:25.989
- Yeah.
- Uh, no, I'm not avoiding you.

37:26.024 --> 37:27.032
Good.

37:27.067 --> 37:28.593
I was just giving
you some space,

37:28.628 --> 37:29.626
I thought that maybe you--

37:29.661 --> 37:31.692
My mother says that, um...

37:31.727 --> 37:33.527
you're too young for me.

37:33.562 --> 37:34.791
Really?

37:34.826 --> 37:37.197
Yeah. Like, you're too young,
too handsome,

37:37.232 --> 37:39.659
basically,
kind of too everything.

37:39.694 --> 37:41.131
Do you always listen
to your mother?

37:41.166 --> 37:42.725
- Yes, I do.
- Well, you shouldn't,

37:42.760 --> 37:44.395
'cause she's wrong.

37:44.430 --> 37:47.197
Also, you look great today.

37:48.232 --> 37:50.692
Really? Thanks.

37:50.727 --> 37:53.263
I didn't do anything different.
Oh, I did.

37:53.298 --> 37:55.923
Um, I went to the gym,

37:55.958 --> 37:57.659
I did a bit of a work...
like, workout.

37:57.694 --> 37:59.065
- Okay.
- Doing some squats,

37:59.100 --> 38:00.692
like intense, really low...

38:00.727 --> 38:04.065
You c-could call...
call me the Queen Squat,
if you-- Maybe not.

38:04.100 --> 38:06.263
- How low, Queen Squat?
- Pretty--

38:15.826 --> 38:17.032
Need a minute?

38:17.562 --> 38:20.923
- No, no, we were just, uh...
- Saying goodnight.

38:21.562 --> 38:23.098
Yeah.

38:23.727 --> 38:26.164
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Cool.

38:37.661 --> 38:40.197
Excuse me, Gabrielle?
You awake?

38:43.496 --> 38:45.362
Right, um...

38:49.727 --> 38:51.263
Okay, um...

38:52.661 --> 38:53.989
I don't know if you
can hear me,

38:54.024 --> 38:57.197
but I need to get
something off my chest.

38:59.133 --> 39:02.428
I don't know why
you were being so open
with me the other night,

39:02.463 --> 39:04.263
you know, sharing those secrets.

39:04.298 --> 39:07.131
A-And I know I didn't
take the ShotTipper
call seriously,

39:07.166 --> 39:11.263
and I know you were
following my lead, and...

39:17.727 --> 39:21.263
Listen, now I'm worried
that all of this is my fault.

39:29.529 --> 39:30.857
God...

39:36.133 --> 39:38.230
That should be me laying there.

39:41.991 --> 39:43.362
Okay...

39:43.397 --> 39:47.923
So, you told me a secret,
about DS Michaels.

39:47.958 --> 39:51.857
Alright, so, how about
I give you one back? Right?

39:53.529 --> 39:54.824
Okay?

39:59.529 --> 40:01.461
My sisters are having babies.

40:05.232 --> 40:08.032
And I'm not a jealous person.

40:08.067 --> 40:10.890
My God, I'm just
so not a jealous person,
but I am burning.

40:10.925 --> 40:13.395
I am green.

40:17.331 --> 40:20.164
Babies, my gosh.

40:21.892 --> 40:25.725
I would love to have
some babies of my own.

40:25.760 --> 40:27.857
And I want them so bad.

40:27.892 --> 40:31.164
I can't swallow right now.

40:32.529 --> 40:34.032
I'm worried, that...

40:35.133 --> 40:37.230
What if it doesn't
happen for me?

40:37.661 --> 40:39.197
What if I waited too long?

40:39.232 --> 40:41.758
What am I waiting for, right?
I don't know!

40:41.793 --> 40:43.659
I'm waiting to get
my life together!

40:53.529 --> 40:58.692
I don't know why...
that happens for some people

40:58.727 --> 41:00.263
and it doesn't happen
for others.

41:00.298 --> 41:02.164
And I'm not just talking
about babies, right?

41:02.199 --> 41:05.758
I'm talking about life,
like the life stuff.

41:05.793 --> 41:08.098
You know, staying
on top of your bills,

41:08.133 --> 41:11.230
knowing when to change
dead batteries,

41:11.826 --> 41:15.593
having healthy
relationships, which...

41:15.628 --> 41:17.362
Mm-mm.

41:20.397 --> 41:23.065
I don't even think
I deserve Nathan.

41:26.991 --> 41:28.956
I think you deserve him
more than me,

41:28.991 --> 41:30.659
and I don't even know
anything about you.

41:34.496 --> 41:37.494
But... I promise,
if you pull through this,

41:37.529 --> 41:40.329
and I need you to pull
through this, Gabrielle...

41:42.595 --> 41:46.428
I think I would like to take you
out to dinner, and...

41:46.463 --> 41:49.428
I don't know, we can talk
about all that...

41:49.463 --> 41:51.428
life stuff.

41:54.100 --> 41:58.593
And maybe if
we become friends,

41:58.628 --> 42:01.956
then I'll forget about him.

42:05.628 --> 42:06.725
Okay?

42:08.166 --> 42:11.659
So, dinner on me, alright?

42:14.826 --> 42:17.263
Excuse me...
Did you follow me?

42:17.298 --> 42:19.824
No, I was just on my way home,
and then I was thinking

42:19.859 --> 42:21.923
about my mother, and then I was
thinking about running away,

42:21.958 --> 42:23.395
and I just found myself here.
- Liar.

42:23.430 --> 42:25.692
You came looking for me,
but I don't wanna talk.

42:25.727 --> 42:27.329
Well, to me,

42:27.364 --> 42:29.527
because you were just
chopping it up with Gabrielle
two seconds ago.

42:29.562 --> 42:32.428
Yeah, yeah, until you
rudely interrupted.

42:33.232 --> 42:36.131
I don't know, Wazowski.

42:37.024 --> 42:39.395
I got a bad feeling
about this one.

42:39.430 --> 42:43.626
And I don't know if it's
because I'm tired, or hungry.

42:43.661 --> 42:44.956
Wanna grab a bite to eat?

42:45.397 --> 42:49.428
Cafeteria's right there.
- Oh. You eat hospital food?

42:49.463 --> 42:51.296
The rice pudding
is very nice.

42:51.331 --> 42:53.626

42:56.463 --> 42:58.824
so then I can eat
and yell in my car.

42:58.859 --> 43:00.626
