[theme music playing]

00:31.898 --> 00:35.067
Tonight on our<i> Celebrity Chefs,</i>
<i>Sports Edition,</i> we have...

00:35.102 --> 00:39.738
former college basketball star
and broadcaster
Rosalyn Gold-Onwude,

00:39.773 --> 00:43.275
three time NBA champ
Bruce Bowen,

00:43.310 --> 00:46.645
and former Heavyweight Champion
of the World, Mike Tyson.

00:46.680 --> 00:50.082
Rosalyn, please tell us
what charity
you'll be playing for.

00:50.117 --> 00:52.617
I'm playing for
the Rosalyn Gold-Onwude
Foundation.

00:52.652 --> 00:55.554
We offer scholarships
to help disadvantaged youths

00:55.589 --> 00:57.656
who want to pursue
a career in sports.

00:57.691 --> 01:00.092
Oh, that's terrific.
Bruce Bowen,

01:00.127 --> 01:03.595
if you win tonight,
what charity
will receive $10,000?

01:03.630 --> 01:06.364
My foundation.
The Bruce Bowen Foundation.

01:06.399 --> 01:08.233
It's an educational
organization

01:08.268 --> 01:12.604
dedicated to transforming
US public education
for under-served youth.

01:12.639 --> 01:15.107
Hm... That...
That is so important.

01:15.142 --> 01:18.243
Mike Tyson, what charity
are you playing for?

01:18.278 --> 01:21.546
The Mike Tyson Foundation.

01:21.581 --> 01:24.583
Can you tell us
a little bit about
the Mike Tyson Foundation?

01:24.618 --> 01:26.551
Oh, it's just
a standard foundation.

01:26.586 --> 01:30.489
Just a typical foundation.
Just like these
two other foundations.

01:30.524 --> 01:32.724
No further questions
and no, thank you.

01:32.759 --> 01:37.429
Uh-huh. Okay, chefs,
let's open your baskets.

01:37.464 --> 01:39.798
We have baby octopus.

01:40.433 --> 01:42.267
Plantains.

01:42.302 --> 01:44.269
Smoked kippers.

01:44.304 --> 01:46.872
And cream of mushroom soup.

01:47.841 --> 01:51.110
Your 30 minutes begins now.

01:53.046 --> 01:55.213
[rock music playing]

01:55.248 --> 01:56.515
Behind!

01:57.250 --> 01:58.783
I just froze. I mean...

01:58.818 --> 02:02.053
I had a plan for
the baby octopus
and the plantains,

02:02.088 --> 02:04.689
but when I pulled out
those smoked kippers,

02:04.724 --> 02:07.125
man, it was like
my head exploded.

02:07.160 --> 02:08.827
Behind!

02:08.862 --> 02:11.263
Those guys were flying around
that kitchen like jackrabbits.

02:11.298 --> 02:12.998
I was just
paralyzed by the clock.

02:13.033 --> 02:16.001
And also, I wish
jackrabbit was one of
the ingredients.

02:16.036 --> 02:17.969
I would have had
a plan for that, too.

02:18.004 --> 02:21.006
Chefs, you have 18 minutes
remaining on the clock.

02:21.041 --> 02:24.409
Looks like Rosalyn
is grilling the octopus,
which is--

02:24.444 --> 02:26.444
Oh, God!
Mike, are you okay?

02:26.479 --> 02:29.047
I'm good, I'm good.
This is just
a tricky can-opener.

02:29.082 --> 02:31.316
I'm good.
How much time did you say?

02:31.351 --> 02:34.753
-Uh...
A little under 18 minutes.
-[beeping]

02:34.788 --> 02:37.656
Okay, okay, I'm gonna
focus on the protein.

02:37.691 --> 02:40.992
Baby octopus. Baby octopus.
Maybe I toast it?

02:41.027 --> 02:44.396
Gee! Bruce is already
using the toaster
to toast a baguette.

02:44.431 --> 02:46.064
Which he got from the pantry.

02:46.099 --> 02:47.999
Which is not even
part of the basket.

02:48.034 --> 02:50.802
And I knew he was
gonna lose points for that.

02:50.837 --> 02:53.972
So I was feeling
pretty confident at this point.

02:54.007 --> 02:55.007
Behind!

02:56.176 --> 02:57.042
Behind!

02:57.844 --> 02:58.944
Behind!

02:58.979 --> 03:01.012
-[beeping]
-[host] Five...

03:01.047 --> 03:02.814
four, three,

03:02.849 --> 03:04.549
two, one.

03:04.584 --> 03:06.785
Chefs, your time is up.

03:08.622 --> 03:10.555
Oh, damn.
I must have cut myself.

03:10.590 --> 03:12.591
I hope I didn't get
any on the food.

03:12.626 --> 03:14.693
[knives snipping]

03:14.728 --> 03:17.829
Let's see whose dish
is on the cutting board.

03:18.632 --> 03:21.600
[tense music playing]

03:23.670 --> 03:26.037
What? Aw...

03:26.072 --> 03:29.274
Mike Tyson, I'm sorry,
I'm afraid you're going home.

03:29.309 --> 03:32.711
-Judges.
-Mike, you didn't cook
any of the ingredients.

03:32.746 --> 03:35.280
You didn't open the soup.
Nothing's been transformed.

03:35.315 --> 03:38.149
You've simply put everything
in the blast chiller and--

03:38.184 --> 03:40.452
-Yeah, to get it cold.
-Can I finish?

03:40.487 --> 03:42.220
Yes, ma'am. Sorry.

03:42.255 --> 03:45.056
But most importantly,
the dish is covered
in your blood.

03:45.091 --> 03:47.292
So, for these reasons,
you're going home.

03:47.327 --> 03:48.660
Damn.

03:51.965 --> 03:54.933
Thank you, judges.
Go, get 'em, guys.

03:54.968 --> 03:56.868
<i>Of course I'm disappointed.</i>

03:56.903 --> 03:59.938
<i>The Mike Tyson Foundation</i>
<i>needed that $10,000.</i>

03:59.973 --> 04:04.376
But this just means that
I have to try harder.
And I'll be back.

04:04.411 --> 04:07.112
<i>And this isn't</i>
<i>the last you'll see of me.</i>

04:07.147 --> 04:09.614
[knives snipping]

04:09.649 --> 04:11.716
Where the [bleep]
is the car, Deezy?

04:11.751 --> 04:13.618
I told the driver
to take the team sightseeing.

04:13.653 --> 04:16.354
I thought for sure
you were gonna make it
to that dessert round.

04:16.389 --> 04:19.124
Okay, hold on, Mike.
I'll call the driver right now.

04:19.159 --> 04:21.626
To your left, uh,
Lady Liberty.

04:21.661 --> 04:23.428
To your right,
Lower Manhattan.

04:23.463 --> 04:25.563
You know, I was gonna
open up a bar
with a buddy of mine.

04:25.598 --> 04:26.965
Right there.

04:27.000 --> 04:28.967
You see where
the little corner market is?

04:29.002 --> 04:31.403
That would've been our bar.

04:31.438 --> 04:34.639
We were all set
to sign the paperwork
and then...

04:34.674 --> 04:36.341
9/11 happened.

04:36.376 --> 04:38.943
We needed an inspection
to get the loan,

04:38.978 --> 04:41.313
but the whole city
was shut down.

04:41.348 --> 04:42.981
Then six months later,

04:43.016 --> 04:45.317
my buddy falls off
a fishing boat
right off Montauk.

04:45.352 --> 04:46.718
They never found the body.

04:47.587 --> 04:49.121
So, no bar for me.

04:50.323 --> 04:51.657
What are you gonna do?

04:53.693 --> 04:55.760
[honking]

04:55.795 --> 04:58.763
Signal! Signal, please!

04:58.798 --> 05:01.199
In America, we use signals!

05:01.234 --> 05:03.335
-[cell phone ringing]
-[beeps]

05:03.370 --> 05:07.039
Hello.
Regal Luxury Transportation.
Burt speaking.

05:08.174 --> 05:09.041
Mm-hmm.

05:10.543 --> 05:12.177
He's already outside waiting?

05:13.380 --> 05:15.880
Okay, uh, lemme...

05:15.915 --> 05:17.882
I'm gonna take
the West Side Highway.

05:17.917 --> 05:19.484
Tell him I'll be there
in 30 minutes.

05:19.519 --> 05:21.319
He doesn't need
to stand outside
and catch a cold.

05:21.354 --> 05:23.688
I'll text him when I'm there
and he can come back out.

05:23.723 --> 05:25.090
[Marquess] Well, this is fun.

05:25.125 --> 05:27.258
Okay, Mike,
he'll be there in 30 minutes.

05:27.293 --> 05:29.761
Cool, cool, then he can
just take us back to the hotel.

05:29.796 --> 05:33.598
Well, Mike, when I booked
the Presidential Suite
at the Waldorf Astoria,

05:33.633 --> 05:35.967
I assumed you were
gonna win $10,000.

05:36.002 --> 05:37.869
I think the prudent thing,
financially,

05:37.904 --> 05:39.237
<i>is for you to come home.</i>

05:39.272 --> 05:41.039
No way, Deezy.

05:41.074 --> 05:43.975
<i>All I want right now</i>
<i>is to plonk myself</i>
<i>in that big bathtub</i>

05:44.010 --> 05:46.911
<i>in the Presidential Suite</i>
<i>at the Waldorf Astoria,</i>

05:46.946 --> 05:49.347
<i>and wash off all this</i>
<i>blood and octopus juice.</i>

05:49.382 --> 05:51.282
Okay, Mike, then at least
do me a favor.

05:51.317 --> 05:53.385
We can make this whole trip
tax-deductible

05:53.420 --> 05:55.220
if you were to do a mystery
while you were there.

05:55.255 --> 05:58.056
<i>That way, it's a business trip.</i>
<i>You know, a write-off.</i>

05:58.091 --> 05:59.891
Well, you're the brain,
Deezy, okay?

05:59.926 --> 06:02.026
<i>So, go dig around</i>
<i>in the pigeon coop</i>

06:02.061 --> 06:06.030
<i>and find a mystery that</i>
<i>takes place in New York City,</i>

06:06.065 --> 06:07.866
[Marquess]
Was there anything cream-based
in the basket?

06:07.901 --> 06:11.703
Like a... Like a cream
of mushroom soup?
Michael! You could have--

06:11.738 --> 06:13.705
[Bleep] you,
Monday morning quarterback.

06:13.740 --> 06:15.840
It looks easy on television,
mother[bleep].

06:15.875 --> 06:18.543
[Sal] Hey!
Mike Tyson Mystery Team.

06:18.578 --> 06:20.345
I'm Sal DeBenedetto.

06:20.380 --> 06:23.148
Follow me.
I'll take you to Mr. Russo.

06:28.254 --> 06:29.121
[door creaking]

06:31.024 --> 06:33.058
[instrumental music playing]

06:50.343 --> 06:52.944
[muffled chatter]

07:02.355 --> 07:03.555
Who the hell are you?

07:03.590 --> 07:07.225
They call me
the exterminator.

07:07.260 --> 07:09.994
Tell Mr. Russo he should
let this office air out

07:10.029 --> 07:11.563
for the next
two or three hours.

07:11.598 --> 07:13.298
[gunshot]

07:13.333 --> 07:16.401
Nobody tells Sal DeBenedetto
what to do.

07:17.337 --> 07:19.103
Except for Mr. Russo.

07:19.138 --> 07:19.971
Come on.

07:20.006 --> 07:21.906
I bet I know where he is.

07:21.941 --> 07:25.043
His favorite pizza joint
in all of New York City.

07:27.247 --> 07:30.582
[Mr. Russo] Thank you
for coming
to see me, Mr. Tyson.

07:30.617 --> 07:33.284
You and your mystery team.

07:33.319 --> 07:34.719
Here, sit down.

07:34.754 --> 07:36.588
Sit.

07:36.623 --> 07:39.858
Sal, get everyone a chair.

07:39.893 --> 07:42.494
You get one
for the [bleep] bird.

07:42.529 --> 07:44.028
Yes, sir, Mr. Russo.

07:44.063 --> 07:47.432
Show some respect to the bird,
you [bleep] gamooch.

07:47.467 --> 07:48.967
So, what's your mystery?

07:49.002 --> 07:50.835
Please, please...

07:50.870 --> 07:52.670
First we eat.

07:52.705 --> 07:54.172
Have a slice.

07:54.207 --> 07:57.242
You never tasted
anything like this.

07:57.277 --> 07:59.511
It's like my mama used to make.

07:59.546 --> 08:00.946
In Sicily.

08:01.848 --> 08:05.717
Huh? Huh?
It's good, huh?

08:05.752 --> 08:07.085
It's pepperoni.

08:07.120 --> 08:08.786
Mmm.

08:08.821 --> 08:11.122
But they got
other toppings, too.

08:11.157 --> 08:14.592
This place is...
It's incredible.

08:14.627 --> 08:17.595
Now I...
I need your help.

08:17.630 --> 08:19.697
It's a personal matter.

08:19.732 --> 08:22.500
My son Carmine is...

08:22.535 --> 08:24.068
He's disappeared.

08:24.103 --> 08:27.438
With $32 million of my money.

08:27.473 --> 08:29.140
I want you to find him

08:29.175 --> 08:32.710
and find out
why he broke my heart.

08:32.745 --> 08:36.347
And then, I want you
to bring him back home to me

08:36.382 --> 08:38.016
so I can kill him.

08:39.452 --> 08:40.385
[door beeps]

08:41.287 --> 08:43.121
Hey, Jason.

08:43.156 --> 08:45.990
You made
an excellent pie tonight.

08:46.025 --> 08:48.293
One of your very best.

08:48.328 --> 08:50.095
<i>Arrivederci.</i>

08:53.232 --> 08:55.400
All right, let's go
find this Carmine Russo.

08:55.435 --> 08:57.702
Dad, he just said
he was gonna kill him.

08:57.737 --> 09:00.772
Deezy says the only way
to make this trip a write-off
is to solve a mystery.

09:00.807 --> 09:03.575
[man]
Hey, this one's not marked.
Large pepperoni?

09:04.344 --> 09:05.310
Oh, here.

09:05.345 --> 09:09.447
35147, Hester.
Apartment 22.

09:09.482 --> 09:11.016
Carmine Russo.

09:12.518 --> 09:13.385
[man] What?

09:14.787 --> 09:16.821
[sniffing]

09:16.856 --> 09:18.656
You're gonna pair very nicely.

09:18.691 --> 09:19.657
[doorbell ringing]

09:19.692 --> 09:21.526
With that large pepperoni.

09:22.228 --> 09:23.227
Huh?

09:23.262 --> 09:25.330
Did you say delivery
or DiGiorno?

09:25.365 --> 09:27.565
-[Yung Hee] Dad!
-[Marquess] Michael!

09:27.600 --> 09:30.969
Why did you steal $32 million
away from your father
and break his heart?

09:31.004 --> 09:33.137
My father
doesn't have a heart.

09:33.172 --> 09:36.107
I discovered that
his waste management company

09:36.142 --> 09:38.509
is just a front for the mob.

09:38.544 --> 09:40.545
He's a despicable person.

09:40.580 --> 09:42.914
And that $32 million
is blood money,

09:42.949 --> 09:45.083
so I'm gonna
donate it to charity.

09:45.118 --> 09:47.352
I was just about
to transfer the money

09:47.387 --> 09:50.521
but I couldn't decide
what charity
I wanted to give it to.

09:50.556 --> 09:53.224
I was leaning towards
the Bruce Bowen Foundation.

09:56.195 --> 09:59.530
Hey, Mike!
Over here. Hey, team.

09:59.565 --> 10:02.133
So how was
the rest of your trip?
You solved that mystery?

10:02.168 --> 10:05.103
I got good news
and I got bad news, Deezy.

10:05.138 --> 10:07.672
The bad news is that
we did not solve the mystery.

10:07.707 --> 10:10.875
But the good news
is that we received
a very generous donation

10:10.910 --> 10:12.744
to The Mike Tyson Foundation.

10:12.779 --> 10:14.178
$32 million!

10:14.213 --> 10:16.114
Holy shit, Mike!
Is this for real?

10:16.149 --> 10:17.715
-[honking]
-Deezy, watch out!

10:17.750 --> 10:18.816
[tires screeching]

10:18.851 --> 10:20.752
[screaming]

10:20.787 --> 10:21.920
[crashing]

10:24.257 --> 10:26.424
Oh, my goodness!
They got one of
these here, too?

10:26.459 --> 10:29.761
Deezy,
you're not gonna believe
how good this place is.

10:29.796 --> 10:32.364
Deezy?
Oh, damn! Deezy is dead.

10:32.899 --> 10:34.666
[groaning]

10:34.701 --> 10:37.468
Oh, damn! Deezy's alive!

10:37.503 --> 10:40.505
[theme music playing]
