00:01.420 --> 00:04.689
<i>Previously on Transformers Prime.</i>

00:04.691 --> 00:08.092
Shockwave...
I thought you'd perished on Cybertron.

00:08.093 --> 00:11.028
The patch failed to
yield any new information

00:11.030 --> 00:13.974
on the whereabouts of the Autobots.

00:16.545 --> 00:20.681
I'd know the hum of that
engine anywhere. Jackie!

00:20.683 --> 00:24.018
- We can't just give up!
- Then tell me what we can do!

00:24.020 --> 00:26.687
We know Starscream had
access to a groundbridge.

00:26.689 --> 00:28.489
<i>He'd clearly
been using the Harbinger.</i>

00:28.491 --> 00:30.758
It could be full of Cybertronian tech.

00:30.760 --> 00:36.630
Resources won't be of much use,
not without someone to lead us.

00:36.632 --> 00:37.875
The Forge.

00:37.877 --> 00:42.079
If you had the Forge,
you could fix yourself up!

00:45.517 --> 00:46.850
Meet Ultra Magnus.

00:46.852 --> 00:54.491
I present to you, my liege,
the ultimate Autobot hunter.

00:56.000 --> 01:02.074

01:17.151 --> 01:18.679
A Predacon.

01:18.679 --> 01:23.179
They've been extinct since the
beginning of Cybertronian history.

01:23.179 --> 01:25.999
Indeed.

01:26.159 --> 01:30.942
But the specimen you see before you
was bred in the laboratory,

01:30.942 --> 01:35.152
cloned from fossilized remains,
which I discovered on Cybertron.

01:35.152 --> 01:40.052
Shockwave, it does my spark
good to see you once again

01:40.052 --> 01:42.252
tampering with creation.

01:42.252 --> 01:46.122
Master, please!
Keep your distance!

01:46.132 --> 01:51.932
No need for alarm. The beast
is completely under my control.

01:53.275 --> 01:56.775
Such primal magnificence.

01:56.785 --> 02:01.045
A sample of Energon, from Wheeljack,

02:01.055 --> 02:06.055
spilled during the Autobot's
failed interrogation.

02:14.835 --> 02:17.339
Let the hunt begin.

02:35.568 --> 02:38.958
<i><font color="cyan">sync & correction by f1nc0

03:12.716 --> 03:15.964
Guys, you know I'm all for
blowin' the scrap outta stuff,

03:15.964 --> 03:18.784
but what does flattening a
Decepticon mine have to do with

03:18.784 --> 03:21.604
getting the band back together
and taking down Megatron?

03:21.604 --> 03:27.174
Simple. When we light up this place,
the blast'll be big and unmistakable.

03:27.174 --> 03:31.344
Any Autobot within 500 klicks will
see the sky glowin' with Energon,

03:31.344 --> 03:35.997
- and come runnin'.
- Then bring the rain.

03:39.527 --> 03:41.437
Mainframe's up and running.

03:41.437 --> 03:44.237
But I'll need help hacking
the operating codes.

03:44.237 --> 03:48.127
Even if the groundbridge proves
functional, it will be next to worthless

03:48.127 --> 03:52.007
without a means of pinpointing the
current locations of our compatriots.

03:53.377 --> 03:55.617
Use your head, Bumblebee.

03:55.617 --> 03:59.390
If the Decepticons had the ability
to track Autobot signals,

03:59.400 --> 04:03.260
we'd have all been at Megatron's mercy
here on Earth a long time ago.

04:03.270 --> 04:06.370
Back where we started.

04:06.370 --> 04:11.310
But not if I can reconfigure
these Decepticon frequencies.

04:11.310 --> 04:15.840
At the very least, we may be
able to access their comm-link.

04:16.850 --> 04:20.510
<i>No one's seen or heard
from you since Cybertron went dark.</i>

04:20.519 --> 04:22.157
How did you find your way to Earth?

04:22.166 --> 04:27.393
Soldier, we may not be on Cybertron,
but military protocol remains.

04:27.403 --> 04:31.133
- My apologies, Sir.
- Sir?

04:31.133 --> 04:36.073
Advise the native life-form
to watch its tone as well.

04:36.073 --> 04:38.243
What? Who is this guy?

04:38.243 --> 04:42.543
Ultra Magnus was Optimus' key Lieutenant
during the war back on Cybertron.

04:42.553 --> 04:45.283
Very "by the book."
Just go with it.

04:45.283 --> 04:47.468
As for your broader question,

04:47.468 --> 04:51.296
my story is that of all
Autobots since the exodus.

04:51.296 --> 04:55.966
I wandered the spaceways in search
of others, reuniting with some,

04:55.976 --> 04:59.976
often only to see them fall
at the hands of the Decepticons.

04:59.976 --> 05:02.906
Until you detected the Omega
beam, and followed it here.

05:02.916 --> 05:05.046
If you are referring to
the massive energy burst

05:05.046 --> 05:09.316
originating from Cybertron,
that would be affirmative.

05:09.316 --> 05:13.359
Upon my arrival, it became evident
that this planet had been invaded.

05:13.369 --> 05:16.299
My scanners also detected
Autobot life signals,

05:16.299 --> 05:19.999
yours being in closest
proximity to my position.

05:20.009 --> 05:22.839
Signals? As in plural?

05:24.009 --> 05:26.839
- Sir.
- Five total.

05:26.849 --> 05:27.909
Out of seven.

05:27.909 --> 05:31.179
Jack, that doesn't necessarily
mean what you're thinking.

05:31.179 --> 05:35.219
Autobot signals can't be detected
when they're shielded.

05:36.758 --> 05:39.762
Cozy little place you built
for yourself, Megatron.

05:39.772 --> 05:43.732
Finding the Forge in
there may take awhile.

05:44.072 --> 05:50.242
Then, again, maybe you still keep
your valuables in the usual place.

06:13.015 --> 06:14.745
I won't let you down, Optimus.

06:14.745 --> 06:20.085
<i>I'm sorry, "overreacting?"
Easy for you to say, Knockout.</i>

06:20.085 --> 06:23.685
Nobody here wants your post.
I, on the other hand, hold

06:23.685 --> 06:27.348
the most coveted position
within the Decepticon ranks.

06:27.348 --> 06:29.238
And no matter what he may claim,

06:29.238 --> 06:33.038
I know that Shockwave
is plotting to usurp me!

06:33.038 --> 06:34.838
<i>Did you see the smug look in his eye</i>

06:34.838 --> 06:39.308
<i>when he unveiled that vile
beast to lord Megatron?</i>

06:57.771 --> 07:00.781
You don't scare me, ugly.

07:07.821 --> 07:11.021
Hello, beautiful.

07:23.474 --> 07:27.544
- Munitions planted.
- Let's get this party started.

07:27.714 --> 07:29.284
Company.

07:29.284 --> 07:34.324
- Megatron?
- Nah. Bigger.

07:37.424 --> 07:41.748
And I don't remember seeing that
move in buckethead's repertoire.

08:07.091 --> 08:10.740
A dragon?
Where'd the 'Cons get a dragon?

08:10.740 --> 08:12.220
- What's a dragon?
- What's a dragon?

08:12.250 --> 08:15.850
Giant flying fire-breathing lizard.

08:17.360 --> 08:18.420
<i>Whoa!</i>

08:54.193 --> 09:00.046
- Bulkhead, you okay?
- Easy, I may be hot to the touch.

09:00.646 --> 09:03.646
Why isn't it coming after us?

09:04.416 --> 09:09.586
Lookin' for me, beast?
I'm right here.
