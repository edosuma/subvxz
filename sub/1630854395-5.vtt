- The pain medication
might make Mr. Furley

00:09.092 --> 00:12.429
a little woozy, so don't let
him text any ex-girlfriends.

00:15.849 --> 00:18.852
- When are you going to retire
that corny-ass joke?

00:18.893 --> 00:22.397
- When it stops making
everyone's frickin' day.

00:22.439 --> 00:24.315
- I saw on the security camera,

00:24.357 --> 00:27.527
we got another compliment.

00:27.569 --> 00:30.238
[sighs] I love feeling
like I'm part of the team

00:30.280 --> 00:33.616
without actually having
to interact with anyone.

00:33.658 --> 00:36.286
- Dr. Pocha,
it's creepy that you watch us

00:36.327 --> 00:37.537
on the cameras.

00:37.579 --> 00:39.622
I usually charge people
for that.

00:41.374 --> 00:43.626
- Another one for Mayan.

00:43.668 --> 00:46.171
They love
that cat texting joke.

00:46.212 --> 00:47.672
Never retire it.

00:49.841 --> 00:50.967
- That means so much

00:51.009 --> 00:52.761
coming from such
a great friend and mentor.

00:52.802 --> 00:55.513
It's like I'm Oprah,
and you're Gayle.

00:55.555 --> 00:58.767
I mean, you're Oprah,
and I'm Gayle.

01:01.728 --> 01:03.563
- What do you want?

01:03.605 --> 01:05.732
- A 5% raise,
my photo on the website,

01:05.774 --> 01:08.026
and Brookie's parking spot?
- [gasps]

01:08.068 --> 01:09.694
- I'll give you the raise.
- Yes.

01:09.736 --> 01:11.780
- But that's actually
my parking spot.

01:11.821 --> 01:13.782
I gave it to Brookie
because I want customers

01:13.823 --> 01:16.826
to think my license plate says
"Bad Bitch."

01:20.455 --> 01:21.915
- [squeals]
- [laughs]

01:21.956 --> 01:23.708
Congratulations on the raise,

01:23.750 --> 01:25.585
and nice try
stealing my parking spot,

01:25.627 --> 01:27.796
but a bad bitch
doesn't walk three blocks.

01:45.730 --> 01:46.690
- Mayan.

01:46.731 --> 01:48.274
- Hey, how'd
the T-ball game go?

01:48.316 --> 01:49.609
- Amazing.

01:49.651 --> 01:51.611
Two parents thought I was
Chance's mom,

01:51.653 --> 01:53.822
and they were reading books
during the game,

01:53.863 --> 01:55.657
so you know they're smart.

01:57.367 --> 02:00.245
- I meant how did the game go
for Chance?

02:00.286 --> 02:02.372
- Oh, it was a bloodbath.

02:04.290 --> 02:07.335
- I need a beer
and a tequila chaser,

02:07.377 --> 02:10.171
and maybe if I black out,
I can forget that game.

02:11.756 --> 02:14.300
- Same.
I'll take a milk in my room.

02:14.342 --> 02:16.219
Actually,
let's do chocolate milk,

02:16.261 --> 02:18.638
and make it a double.

02:18.680 --> 02:20.306
- Where does he get this stuff?

02:22.100 --> 02:23.351
- Was the game that bad?

02:23.393 --> 02:25.437
- [sighs]
It's not about the scoreboard.

02:25.478 --> 02:28.273
Okay, as their coach,
I am teaching these kids

02:28.314 --> 02:30.942
about courage
in the face of defeat.

02:30.984 --> 02:34.112
- All you're teaching them
is how to lose,

02:34.154 --> 02:36.823
and after losing
14 games in a row,

02:36.865 --> 02:39.576
I think they got it.

02:39.617 --> 02:41.828
- You know, it doesn't matter
what you say, George,

02:41.870 --> 02:44.039
'cause as long
as I got this hat on,

02:44.080 --> 02:45.665
I'm the boss.
- Milk!

02:45.707 --> 02:48.001
- Yep.

02:48.043 --> 02:51.379
<i>- Ay,</i>it's a shame you keep
missing Chance's games.

02:51.421 --> 02:54.174
You need to ask your boss
to let you off work early.

02:54.215 --> 02:55.675
- I just asked for a raise.

02:55.717 --> 02:57.469
I can't ask
to leave early, too.

02:57.510 --> 03:00.847
- Just do what I do.
Use one of the three Ds--

03:00.889 --> 03:04.434
death, discrimination,
or diarrhea.

03:05.935 --> 03:08.772
- As a mom,
your kid looks up to you.

03:08.813 --> 03:10.273
You don't want
to let them down.

03:10.315 --> 03:13.234
So you have to do whatever
it takes to be there for them.

03:13.276 --> 03:15.111
- I know, Mom.
You were perfect.

03:15.153 --> 03:17.530
- Oh, your words, not mine.

03:17.572 --> 03:19.741
I always had a full-time job,

03:19.783 --> 03:22.160
and I still managed to be
at your T-ball games,

03:22.202 --> 03:25.413
your dance recitals,
and your OB-GYN appointments.

03:26.915 --> 03:31.294
- That was last week,
and I told you to stop coming.

03:31.336 --> 03:32.712
- I'm telling you, Mayan,

03:32.754 --> 03:34.631
you don't want to regret
not being there for Chance

03:34.673 --> 03:38.051
the way someone wasn't there
for your T-ball games.

03:38.093 --> 03:39.427
- I was at those T-ball games.

03:39.469 --> 03:42.305
- You were passed out
in your car.

03:42.347 --> 03:45.183
- If a tree falls in the woods

03:45.225 --> 03:47.519
and nobody's there
to hear it...

03:47.560 --> 03:49.354
it's still in the woods.

03:51.606 --> 03:54.317
It's just laying there...

03:54.359 --> 03:56.319
sleeping it off.

04:00.532 --> 04:02.742
- Dad, we need to talk.

04:04.619 --> 04:06.996
- An open dialogue?
That's so mature.

04:07.038 --> 04:09.833
My little man's growing up!

04:09.874 --> 04:11.084
- The team voted,

04:11.126 --> 04:13.253
and we don't want you
to be our coach anymore.

04:13.294 --> 04:16.006
- You're a baby, and you don't
know what you're talking about.

04:17.507 --> 04:18.800
- I'm sorry.

04:18.842 --> 04:22.095
Nobody gets into T-ball
to fire their dad.

04:22.137 --> 04:24.931
- I-I have the coach's hat.

04:24.973 --> 04:28.560
- Yeah, and I'm gonna need
that back for the new guy.

04:28.601 --> 04:30.103
- Aw, man!
Did we miss it?

04:30.145 --> 04:32.022
Shoot!

04:32.063 --> 04:33.148
- Wait, wait, wait.

04:33.189 --> 04:34.733
Your--your grandpa
is taking my place?

04:34.774 --> 04:38.028
- And me.
I'm the third-base coach.

04:38.069 --> 04:41.865
My first rule is no more
overly positive cheers like,

04:41.906 --> 04:46.327
"Losing isn't hard to do when
we lose to friends like you."

04:47.871 --> 04:50.331
- It's catchy, and it makes
everyone feel good.

04:50.373 --> 04:52.667
- We've been faking it!

04:56.588 --> 04:59.591
Grandpa and tío Oscar promised
to make us champs!

04:59.632 --> 05:02.510
I want a trophy, dog!

05:05.764 --> 05:08.475
- Are you sure, Chance?

05:08.516 --> 05:11.353
As in maybe give
your old man a second one.

05:11.394 --> 05:15.357
- Sorry, just like me,
you only get one.

05:20.945 --> 05:24.199
<i>* *</i>

05:24.240 --> 05:25.992
- Hi, Mom.
Why are you mopping?

05:26.034 --> 05:27.660
I just cleaned
the floors this morning.

05:27.702 --> 05:29.746
- I see you think that's true.

05:31.164 --> 05:33.041
- At least it's the kitchen,
not the bedroom.

05:33.083 --> 05:36.878
I feel really weird about you
organizing my sex toys.

05:36.920 --> 05:39.964
- Oh, no, don't worry.
I disinfected them first.

05:40.006 --> 05:42.842
They're cooling off
on the stove.

05:42.884 --> 05:44.511
What are you doing here anyway?

05:44.552 --> 05:45.845
Shouldn't you be
at Chance's game?

05:45.887 --> 05:47.847
Did you ask your boss
for the time off?

05:47.889 --> 05:50.975
- No, because like I told you,
she just gave me a raise.

05:51.017 --> 05:52.894
I'm not gonna leave her
to close by herself.

05:52.936 --> 05:55.480
- That's sweet, how you're
bending over backwards

05:55.522 --> 05:56.815
for a total stranger.

05:56.856 --> 05:59.651
If only you had
the same level of dedication

05:59.693 --> 06:02.237
to your own child.

06:02.278 --> 06:04.906
- Mommy, we won!
I hit a home run!

06:04.948 --> 06:06.658
- Yeah, it was a great night
for everyone.

06:06.700 --> 06:08.034
They won their game,

06:08.076 --> 06:11.663
and I was nominated
to run the snack booth.

06:11.705 --> 06:13.707
- You don't miss
being the coach?

06:13.748 --> 06:16.584
- No, I am loving
the opportunity to show Chance

06:16.626 --> 06:18.253
how to bounce back
from rejection

06:18.294 --> 06:22.090
with grace
and a mandatory hairnet.

06:22.132 --> 06:25.218
- Get ready
to bounce again, bro...

06:25.260 --> 06:28.596
'cause the kids hated
your figs in a blanket,

06:28.638 --> 06:31.391
- Okay, let's get you
upstairs, papa.

06:31.433 --> 06:33.018
- Damn, I'm exhausted, man.

06:33.059 --> 06:34.436
Those kids don't listen.

06:34.477 --> 06:37.897
They complain, and when you
need 'em, they disappear.

06:37.939 --> 06:39.941
- It makes sense
they made you their leader.

06:41.860 --> 06:45.071
You know, Mayan knows the game,
and she's great with kids.

06:45.113 --> 06:46.906
If she was there,
she could help you,

06:46.948 --> 06:50.201
and Chance could have
a parent at the games.

06:50.243 --> 06:51.453
- I'm there.

06:53.246 --> 06:56.124
- Stick to the figs there,
Snack Efron.

06:58.126 --> 07:00.503
I'd love Mayan to help,
but she can't get off work.

07:00.545 --> 07:02.964
- She only thinks
she can't get off work.

07:03.006 --> 07:04.341
Come here.

07:04.382 --> 07:09.012
Just like she thinks
that these floors are clean.

07:09.054 --> 07:12.098
It takes a village
to raise a perfect mom,

07:12.140 --> 07:14.351
and I am that village.

07:14.392 --> 07:15.852
- She just took the dog.

07:15.894 --> 07:19.064
You think that's something
we need to worry about?

07:19.105 --> 07:21.691
- I think we should be worrying
about what's for dinner.

07:27.280 --> 07:31.785
- Now, who can tell me what's
wrong with this sentence?

07:32.952 --> 07:37.207
"Always play fair
unless you're losing,"

07:37.248 --> 07:38.917
which is why
I want to introduce you

07:38.958 --> 07:41.419
to your newest teammate,
Robbie,

07:41.461 --> 07:44.339
AKA the Mexicutioner!

07:46.216 --> 07:47.384
- Yo.

07:48.968 --> 07:51.429
- We work out at the same gym.

07:51.471 --> 07:53.223
- Robbie mostly plays football.

07:53.264 --> 07:54.641
- How does that help us?

07:54.683 --> 07:56.643
- Okay, imagine Coach Oscar

07:56.685 --> 07:58.603
is the first baseman
on the other team.

07:58.645 --> 07:59.771
Robbie comes up at bat.

07:59.813 --> 08:02.273
He gets a hit,

08:02.315 --> 08:05.276
and I yell,
"Send 'em home, Robbie!"

08:05.318 --> 08:07.779
And boom!

08:07.821 --> 08:10.740
Out for the rest of the season!

08:13.868 --> 08:16.579
Look who it is.
- I know, I know.

08:16.621 --> 08:18.373
I'm Betty Cracker.

08:20.667 --> 08:23.503
- You can say that, not me.

08:23.545 --> 08:25.296
- I just wanted
to show the team

08:25.338 --> 08:28.675
that when life gives you
lemons, you make lemon bars.

08:29.843 --> 08:31.803
- You know what?
I know you're upset.

08:31.845 --> 08:33.138
You can drop the act, okay?

08:33.179 --> 08:36.182
There aren't any kids around
to hear you.

08:36.224 --> 08:38.601
- One of these days,
when you least expect it,

08:38.643 --> 08:42.814
I will find something you love
and ruin it for you.

Hey, Churro.

08:55.326 --> 08:57.412
What brings you in today?

08:58.747 --> 09:00.331
That's your cue.

09:00.373 --> 09:03.752
- Oh, I thought you read
their minds or something.

09:03.793 --> 09:06.087
I'm worried
about her bad breath.

09:06.129 --> 09:07.255
- Oh.

09:08.798 --> 09:12.344
Well, given that they lick
their butts throughout the day,

09:12.385 --> 09:16.181
you got to cut 'em
a little slack.

09:16.222 --> 09:17.390
Hmm, looks good.

09:17.432 --> 09:19.017
I'll give you
some dental treats.

09:19.059 --> 09:20.727
Anything else I can do for you?

09:20.769 --> 09:22.687
- Yes, you can start
treating my daughter

09:22.729 --> 09:24.314
with a little respect.

09:24.356 --> 09:25.982
- I'm sorry.

09:26.024 --> 09:29.194
I respect you, Churro.

09:29.235 --> 09:31.988
- No.
My daughter is Mayan.

09:32.030 --> 09:34.032
- Your Mayan's mom?
- Oh, I know.

09:34.074 --> 09:37.160
We look like
we could be sisters.

09:37.202 --> 09:39.454
And I need you
to let her off work early

09:39.496 --> 09:42.123
so she can attend her son's
T-ball games on Thursdays.

09:42.165 --> 09:44.751
[door opens]
- Hey, Dr. Pocha, I--

09:44.793 --> 09:47.337
Mom? Oh, my God,
what's wrong with Churro?

09:47.379 --> 09:49.381
- Nothing.
Your mom just came down

09:49.422 --> 09:53.176
to ask if you can leave early
for your son's T-ball games.

09:53.218 --> 09:54.803
- She what?

09:56.054 --> 09:57.722
I'm so sorry, Dr. Pocha.

09:57.764 --> 10:01.976
Her brain's been pickled by
huffing Jean Nate and Fabuloso.

10:03.770 --> 10:05.730
I'll take care of this.
- Okay.

10:05.772 --> 10:07.315
I'll let you two talk.

10:07.357 --> 10:10.026
This mother-daughter dynamic
is why I came in one weekend

10:10.068 --> 10:12.112
and spayed myself.

10:12.153 --> 10:14.823
[chuckles] I didn't.
[both laugh]

10:14.864 --> 10:16.491
Or did I?

10:19.119 --> 10:21.371
- I can't believe
you showed up at my work

10:21.413 --> 10:23.915
and confronted my boss--
I'm so embarrassed.

10:23.957 --> 10:26.376
- What? You weren't going
to do it, so I did.

10:26.418 --> 10:27.836
I'm a doer.

10:27.877 --> 10:29.754
- This isn't double-mopping
my floors

10:29.796 --> 10:33.425
or asking my gyno
to look a little deeper.

10:33.466 --> 10:35.802
This is my place of work.

10:35.844 --> 10:38.013
How is my boss supposed
to respect me

10:38.054 --> 10:41.433
when my own mother doesn't?
- Okay.

10:41.474 --> 10:43.059
It's not even my fault.

10:43.101 --> 10:45.270
If you want to blame someone,
blame your father.

10:45.311 --> 10:46.938
- Ho-ho, I will.

10:46.980 --> 10:48.982
Wait, for what?
- Yeah.

10:49.024 --> 10:51.317
He was complaining
like always, saying,

10:51.359 --> 10:53.486
[imitates George] "Oh, coaching
these kids--it's too hard.

10:53.528 --> 10:54.779
"I'm overwhelmed.

10:54.821 --> 10:56.156
"I don't know
how to be a husband,

10:56.197 --> 10:58.366
"a father, a lover, a coach.

10:58.408 --> 11:00.201
<i>Orale."</i>

11:03.788 --> 11:06.958
And then he asked me to come
speak to your boss, so I did.

11:07.000 --> 11:09.836
It could've been
so much worse, Mayan.

11:09.878 --> 11:13.131
- Okay, so you were trying
to respect me,

11:13.173 --> 11:15.342
but Dad put you
in a bad situation.

11:15.383 --> 11:17.635
I'm sorry, Mom.
- [groans]

11:17.677 --> 11:19.804
All is forgiven--

11:19.846 --> 11:22.640
not forgotten but forgiven.

11:22.682 --> 11:25.477
<i>* *</i>

11:25.518 --> 11:28.104
- Coach Grandpa,
I'm so uncomfortable.

11:28.146 --> 11:30.398
Why do I have to sleep
on my glove?

11:30.440 --> 11:32.817
- Quickest way to break it in
is to sleep on it

11:32.859 --> 11:34.027
with a baseball inside.

11:34.069 --> 11:35.153
- You should do it.

11:35.195 --> 11:38.490
You weigh, like,
five times more than me.

11:38.531 --> 11:41.409
- All right, first,
no body-shaming,

11:41.451 --> 11:45.038
and, second, you're higher up,
so gravity makes you heavier.

11:47.040 --> 11:49.000
- Dad, I need to talk to you.

11:49.042 --> 11:52.837
- If this is about his weight,
don't go there.

11:52.879 --> 11:55.215
Someone's delicate tonight.

11:56.841 --> 11:58.218
- Chance,
put on your headphones.

11:58.259 --> 12:01.179
- Ooh, you're in trouble.

12:01.221 --> 12:03.223
- Mom, said you sent her
to tell my boss

12:03.264 --> 12:04.516
to let me leave early.

12:04.557 --> 12:06.601
- What? I didn't tell her
to do anything.

12:06.643 --> 12:08.144
And even if I had,

12:08.186 --> 12:10.438
name one time that that
woman's ever listened to me--

12:10.480 --> 12:13.692
even when we used
our safe word, "chorizo."

12:13.733 --> 12:16.194
- Gross, and don't gaslight me.

12:16.236 --> 12:20.198
- I would never gaslight you.
Gas is way too expensive.

12:20.240 --> 12:21.658
You know what?
I can prove that she's lying.

12:21.700 --> 12:23.910
Quinten, get in here.

12:25.120 --> 12:27.414
Presenting my star witness--
Gringo Starr.

12:28.915 --> 12:30.291
- What's going on?

12:30.333 --> 12:31.960
- Uh, hey, you were there
when I was talking to Rosie.

12:32.002 --> 12:34.462
Did I tell her to go to Mayan's
work and talk to her boss?

12:34.504 --> 12:38.216
- No, Rosie made some ominous
comments and kidnapped the dog.

12:38.258 --> 12:40.427
I was gonna stop her,
but I did not want to offend

12:40.468 --> 12:42.721
the only person
who can get our floors clean.

12:42.762 --> 12:44.347
[clears throat]

12:44.389 --> 12:46.224
- Yeah, you see?
Innocent.

12:46.266 --> 12:47.684
- I don't know
what's more shocking--

12:47.726 --> 12:50.437
that you told the truth
or that Mom lied to me.

12:50.478 --> 12:52.397
- Well, she probably
gaslit you, too.

12:52.439 --> 12:56.067
I mean, she's got a good job.
She can afford many gallons.

12:56.109 --> 12:57.652
The good thing is
that I'm here now,

12:57.694 --> 13:00.822
you know, to defend myself
against those lies.

13:00.864 --> 13:03.324
- Wow, you think
she's done this before--

13:03.366 --> 13:05.410
blamed you for things
that she's done?

13:05.452 --> 13:07.245
- Uh, yeah.

13:07.287 --> 13:09.247
She wanted me
to seem worse than I am.

13:09.289 --> 13:11.166
I'm bad enough.
I don't need her help.

13:11.207 --> 13:14.169
- Ooh, Grandma's in trouble.

13:14.210 --> 13:16.171
- You're not supposed to hear
with those on.

13:16.212 --> 13:18.465
- Ooh, now I'm in trouble.

13:23.636 --> 13:24.888
- I'm here.

13:24.929 --> 13:26.431
Where did Churro vomit?

13:26.473 --> 13:28.808
I brought my special blend
of Fabuloso and lighter fluid.

13:30.560 --> 13:32.520
- The only thing
we'll be cleaning up today

13:32.562 --> 13:33.772
are your lies...

13:35.231 --> 13:37.108
Menti-Rosie.

13:39.444 --> 13:41.029
- What's the <i>viejo</i>
talking about?

13:41.071 --> 13:42.530
- Mom, there's no Churro vomit.

13:42.572 --> 13:44.616
I lied to get you over here

13:44.657 --> 13:47.535
because I know Dad didn't ask
you to show up at my work,

13:47.577 --> 13:48.828
and we need to talk about it.

13:48.870 --> 13:51.206
- Did he tell you this?
And you believed him?

13:51.247 --> 13:53.249
He's a liar.
He fakes his diarrhea.

13:53.291 --> 13:56.211
There, we talked about it.

13:56.252 --> 13:58.922
- Quinten confirmed it.

13:58.963 --> 14:01.424
- [sighs]

14:01.466 --> 14:04.135
You're never gonna clean
our floors again, are you?

14:05.845 --> 14:08.765
- I got out my diaries
because now I need to know

14:08.807 --> 14:10.934
what childhood traumas
you blamed on Dad

14:10.975 --> 14:12.811
and which ones were you.

14:12.852 --> 14:15.397
- So buckle up, <i>bruja!</i>

14:18.274 --> 14:21.611
Because all your gas
is coming to the light!

14:24.155 --> 14:25.657
- When we're done here,

14:25.699 --> 14:29.285
we really need to explain
gaslighting to you.

14:29.327 --> 14:31.371
Just keep score,
Vanna Whiteboy.

14:33.915 --> 14:38.420
- Here's my top-ten traumas
from the early aughts.

14:38.461 --> 14:40.296
Trauma number one--

14:40.338 --> 14:42.841
the time nobody showed up
to drive me home,

14:42.882 --> 14:46.219
and I was left at Ross
for five hours.

14:46.261 --> 14:47.470
Mom or Dad?

14:47.512 --> 14:49.639
- Surprise, your dad.

14:49.681 --> 14:52.684
- I thought Ross
was the babysitter.

14:54.310 --> 14:56.688
- Okay, that's one for George.

14:56.730 --> 14:57.814
- Number two--

14:57.856 --> 15:02.152
the Easter egg hunt
with no eggs.

15:02.193 --> 15:05.739
Mom said you used all of them
to make an Easter eggnog.

15:05.780 --> 15:08.158
- Not possible--
I spent every Easter in Vegas

15:08.199 --> 15:10.827
with Bunny Perez.

15:10.869 --> 15:14.247
And she assured me
that she didn't have any eggs.

15:14.289 --> 15:18.626
- I forgot to put them out.
- Okay, that's a Rosie one.

15:19.794 --> 15:21.755
- Dead hamster?

15:21.796 --> 15:26.092
Let legally blind grandma
cut my hair?

15:26.134 --> 15:28.928
Deported uncle?

Dead hamster number two?

15:37.395 --> 15:39.439
Girl Scout scam?

15:42.442 --> 15:44.819
I think we could use
a little snack break.

15:46.196 --> 15:47.572
- Two dead hamsters?

15:47.614 --> 15:50.241
We got to keep your parents
away from Churro.

15:52.410 --> 15:56.247
- I'm gonna post this
on my Instagram.

15:56.289 --> 15:59.459
Rosie <i>la reina</i>is to blame-a.

16:00.752 --> 16:03.046
- Yeah, you're really having
fun with this, huh?

16:03.088 --> 16:05.382
- I always knew you were
poisoning Mayan against me.

16:05.423 --> 16:06.800
- Congratulations.

16:06.841 --> 16:09.678
You finally have proof
that I am not the perfect mom.

16:09.719 --> 16:12.931
But guess what.
I've known that for years.

16:13.723 --> 16:17.644
- Why are you agreeing with me?
Is this what gaslighting is?

16:20.897 --> 16:22.649
- [sighs] <i>Ay.</i>

16:22.691 --> 16:25.694
You remember that summer that
Mayan stayed at my sister's,

16:25.735 --> 16:26.861
and I told you that it was

16:26.903 --> 16:28.530
because I needed
bunion surgery?

16:28.571 --> 16:30.281
- Yeah, yeah,
you went to Mexico.

16:30.323 --> 16:31.741
- I never went to Mexico.

16:31.783 --> 16:34.285
I dropped Mayan off,
went back home,

16:34.327 --> 16:36.121
pulled down the shades,
got in bed,

16:36.162 --> 16:37.914
and cried
for three weeks straight.

16:37.956 --> 16:42.002
Later, I found out
I had a nervous breakdown.

16:42.043 --> 16:44.546
- Wow, I'm--I mean, is that
what the doctor said?

16:44.587 --> 16:46.339
<i>- Ay,</i>doctor?
I couldn't afford a doctor.

16:46.381 --> 16:48.967
I saw that on "Grey's Anatomy."

16:50.385 --> 16:53.596
- I mean, uh,
how come you never told me?

16:53.638 --> 16:56.558
- Because you being gone
was part of it.

16:58.309 --> 17:00.603
[sighs]
I was working three jobs,

17:00.645 --> 17:02.605
trying to start a new business,

17:02.647 --> 17:05.817
raising a kid who was
heartbroken after we split up.

17:07.360 --> 17:09.821
I was just trying
to hold it together

17:09.863 --> 17:11.906
until I couldn't.

17:13.491 --> 17:16.369
- Wow, I mean,
you never said anything.

17:16.411 --> 17:18.747
Every time I saw you,
you looked hot.

17:18.788 --> 17:20.081
- Thank you.

17:20.123 --> 17:21.541
I know.

17:24.169 --> 17:25.962
- Mayan never said anything.

17:26.004 --> 17:27.422
- Oh, Mayan didn't know.

17:27.464 --> 17:29.507
I wanted to be perfect for her

17:29.549 --> 17:32.594
because everything
in her life wasn't.

17:32.635 --> 17:34.304
But I just couldn't keep it up.

17:34.346 --> 17:36.806
So, yeah...

17:36.848 --> 17:40.935
sometimes
I threw you under the bus...

17:40.977 --> 17:42.687
when I screwed up.

17:44.647 --> 17:47.150
That's how I survived.

17:47.192 --> 17:48.943
- [softly] Wow.

17:48.985 --> 17:51.654
- Let's move
to the middle-school years.

17:57.077 --> 17:58.995
- Yeah, we don't have to go
through this.

17:59.037 --> 18:00.413
I recognize this.

18:00.455 --> 18:03.333
These were
all the mescal years.

18:03.375 --> 18:06.878
Yeah, you know what?
Those are all me.

Winner, winner!
Pollo Loco dinner!

18:13.385 --> 18:16.680

you want to win.

18:16.721 --> 18:18.598
- I'm okay with that.

all the mescal years

mescal.

- [chuckles]

18:45.667 --> 18:50.505
You know, a lot of that stuff
on that last list was my fault.

18:50.547 --> 18:52.590
Why'd you take the blame?

18:52.632 --> 18:54.634
- You did a great job
raising Mayan,

18:54.676 --> 18:56.970
despite everything
that I threw at you.

18:57.012 --> 18:59.139
And maybe
you weren't the perfect mom,

18:59.180 --> 19:02.517
but...you were the perfect mom
for Mayan.

19:02.559 --> 19:05.103
- You really think so?
- Yeah.

19:05.145 --> 19:07.480
And the proof is in
that firecracker out there

19:07.522 --> 19:10.275
in the living room.
- [chuckles]

19:10.316 --> 19:12.318
- And I understand
why you did what you did.

19:12.360 --> 19:13.820
I mean, let's face it.

19:13.862 --> 19:15.905
If we played that game
listing all the wrongdoings

19:15.947 --> 19:19.743
I did to you,
we'd run out of ink.

19:19.784 --> 19:21.703
- Is that an apology?

19:21.745 --> 19:23.747
- I'm starting to learn

19:23.788 --> 19:27.083
that a little <i>"lo siento"</i>
goes a long way.

19:27.125 --> 19:29.753
- Okay, so we don't have
to break out my old diaries

19:29.794 --> 19:32.505
and read through them?
- No.

19:32.547 --> 19:34.341
Only the dirty parts.

to ask to leave early.

20:45.412 --> 20:46.705
- I didn't have to.

I told the league
it was discrimination

20:48.540 --> 20:51.042

to have games before 5:00 p.m.
