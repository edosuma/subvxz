Good. Got it?

00:42.459 --> 00:44.794
- "Selena,
grab a large stock pot,

00:44.878 --> 00:48.548
fill with water
and heat to a boil."

00:48.631 --> 00:50.467
The water's already
placed in here.

00:50.550 --> 00:53.803
- Okay, on boil?
- Well, on high for it to boil.

00:53.887 --> 00:54.888
- Perfect.
- There you go.

00:54.971 --> 00:56.347
- Okay.
- On boil.

00:56.431 --> 00:58.183
- I'm so interested in this.

00:58.266 --> 01:00.518
What is this?
[all gasp]

01:00.602 --> 01:04.355
Oh, my God. Oh.
- Oh, my God.

01:04.439 --> 01:05.565
- I can't do this.

01:05.648 --> 01:07.233
- What do we do?
- Oh, my God!

01:07.317 --> 01:08.985
- Wait, what are we
supposed to do?

01:09.068 --> 01:10.445
- I can't.

01:10.528 --> 01:13.490
- Wait. Let's just do this.
Okay, close it up.

01:13.573 --> 01:15.492
- Oh, my gosh.
Okay.

01:15.575 --> 01:16.701
Oh, no.

01:16.785 --> 01:18.536
I wanted to name
one of them Fred,

01:18.620 --> 01:20.497
and then I got
emotionally attached.

01:20.580 --> 01:22.081
- Aw.
- No.

01:22.165 --> 01:23.333
We just can't name them.

02:35.655 --> 02:37.073
Okay?
- Okay.

02:37.156 --> 02:39.450
- So now that we have
this boiling pot of water,

02:39.534 --> 02:41.953
let's add some seasoning 'cause
it's gonna need that flavor.

02:42.036 --> 02:43.288
It's gonna need
that love, right?

02:43.371 --> 02:45.415
- Yes.
- So, let's add

02:45.498 --> 02:47.083
some Cajun seasoning.

02:47.167 --> 02:49.752
- Got it.
- Be very generous with it.

02:49.836 --> 02:52.255
So let's use
about half of that.

02:52.338 --> 02:53.464
- Eh-heh.

02:53.548 --> 02:55.091
- Now, this is where
you can have fun.

02:55.174 --> 02:57.760
<i>You can put any kind of citrus</i>
<i>you really want,</i>

02:57.844 --> 02:59.888
<i>but I'm gonna go ahead</i>
<i>and put one lemon in there.</i>

02:59.971 --> 03:01.431
So let's take half a lemon.

03:01.514 --> 03:03.975
- Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hang on.

03:04.058 --> 03:07.854
- What happened?
- I just got the seasoning in.

03:07.937 --> 03:09.272
What do I do?
- Okay.

03:09.355 --> 03:11.733
Let's take one lemon.
- Okay. Thank you.

- I'm sorry, 'cause I'm like,
on that chef mode,

03:14.068 --> 03:15.403
and sometimes I go fast.

03:15.486 --> 03:18.781
- No, no, that's good.
I'm--I'm just not.

03:18.865 --> 03:19.949
- [laughs]

03:20.033 --> 03:21.451
All right, so let's cut one
in half.

03:21.534 --> 03:23.244
- Okay, yes. Let's do that.

03:23.328 --> 03:25.371
Done.
- Now to the pot.

03:25.455 --> 03:28.249
Squeeze it and
drop it in there.

03:28.333 --> 03:31.210
- Yep.
- Oh, that's a juicy lemon.

03:31.294 --> 03:33.046
- Do you happen to have
any bay leaf?

03:33.129 --> 03:35.298
- Yes, I sure do.
- Oh, my gosh.

03:35.381 --> 03:39.052
- [gasps]
- Good catch.

03:39.135 --> 03:42.805
- All right, let's add
a couple bay leaves in the pot.

03:42.889 --> 03:45.975
- Boom.
- Last step, some salt.

03:46.059 --> 03:48.394
A generous little heaping.
- Got it.

03:48.478 --> 03:50.730
- Now, this is the part
that's gonna break your hearts.

- Now, just pull them out
and put them on a tray.

03:59.072 --> 04:00.740
No big deal.

04:00.823 --> 04:02.450
- Oh.
<i>- Yes, indeed.</i>

<i>Look at those little fellas.</i>

<i>- Come on, we can do it.</i>

<i>- Love this.</i>
- Oh, my God.

04:16.422 --> 04:19.926
- Okay. Now, here's the deal.
Take some scissors

04:20.009 --> 04:22.095
and just kind of take off
those rubber bands.

04:22.178 --> 04:23.763
- Oh.
- [exhales deeply]

04:25.765 --> 04:28.017
<i>- Okay, there we go.</i>
<i>This is great.</i>

04:28.101 --> 04:29.435
- Look at legs.
<i>- You're doing fantastic.</i>

04:29.519 --> 04:30.895
- We've seen a lot
on this show.

04:30.979 --> 04:32.271
We've never seen this.

04:32.355 --> 04:33.856
<i>- There's a first</i>
<i>for everything.</i>

04:33.940 --> 04:35.441
- Taking the blazer off.

04:35.525 --> 04:37.694
- You're doing great, Selena.
I'm very proud of you.

04:37.777 --> 04:39.320
- Thank you.
- It's all good.

04:39.404 --> 04:42.365
Let's grab our shrimp, okay?
- Okay.

04:42.448 --> 04:44.200
- These little bad boys have
been dispatched,

04:44.283 --> 04:45.201
<i>so don't worry.</i>

04:45.284 --> 04:46.911
Now, what we're gonna do

04:46.995 --> 04:50.123
is just put your little sort
of scissors down the middle.

04:50.206 --> 04:52.208
And what we're trying to do
is just devein them

04:52.291 --> 04:53.751
but keep them in the shell.

04:53.835 --> 04:58.464
- So I just cut the middle,
and the poop is gone?

04:58.548 --> 05:00.591
- Yeah, the poop sac is what
we're trying to get out of.

05:00.675 --> 05:04.137
- And the shell's on.
<i>- With the shell on, exactly.</i>

05:04.220 --> 05:06.180
'Cause when you leave
the shell on,

05:06.264 --> 05:09.183
it actually reinforces
the flavor of the shrimp.

05:09.267 --> 05:12.353
And by the way, we're very
blessed to live in Louisiana,

05:12.437 --> 05:15.398
where we have the best shrimp
in the whole world,

05:15.481 --> 05:17.525
<i>as well</i>
<i>as beautiful crab meat,</i>

05:17.608 --> 05:19.819
which will be all part
of this seafood soirée.

05:19.902 --> 05:22.405
- In the nicest like, way,
endearing way,

05:22.488 --> 05:23.865
you remind me of my dad.

05:23.948 --> 05:26.576
- Aw, you're so sweet.
<i>Gracias.</i>

05:26.659 --> 05:28.202
- Of course.
<i>- Well, you know,</i>

05:28.286 --> 05:30.580
you and I are both
Texas kids, right?

05:30.663 --> 05:32.081
I'm from El Paso.

05:32.165 --> 05:35.293
- Oh, I'm from Grand Prairie,
outside of Dallas.

05:35.376 --> 05:36.878
- Oh, wonderful.

05:36.961 --> 05:39.338
I think it might be time to put
our little guys in there.

05:39.422 --> 05:40.840
- Oh, my God.
<i>- I believe in you.</i>

05:40.923 --> 05:42.383
<i>It's gonna be easy.</i>
- Paige?

05:42.467 --> 05:43.926
<i>- All right, just grab them.</i>
- What?

05:44.010 --> 05:45.720
- The water's boiling.
We're fine. Come on.

05:45.803 --> 05:47.764
- Oh...
- Together we will conquer.

05:47.847 --> 05:49.140
Ready?
- Whoo!

05:49.223 --> 05:51.851
- Just drop them in there
very softly, okay?

05:51.934 --> 05:53.311
Headfirst.
- Headfirst.

05:53.394 --> 05:55.396
- And then cover it
with the lid, ladies.

05:55.480 --> 05:57.106
- Oh, my God.
- Aah!

05:57.190 --> 05:58.524
<i>- All right, cover it</i>
<i>with the lid.</i>

05:58.608 --> 05:59.984
<i>Lid, lid, lid on.</i>
- Oh, my God.

06:00.068 --> 06:02.320
<i>- It's all good, ladies.</i>
<i>All right, cool.</i>

06:02.403 --> 06:03.905
- That was crazy.

06:03.988 --> 06:05.782
- Very proud of you,
very proud of you.

06:05.865 --> 06:07.950
- RIP, Fred.
<i>- Okay.</i>

06:08.034 --> 06:10.495
So, basically, it takes
about seven to eight minutes

06:10.578 --> 06:12.580
to get them
in a happy place, okay?

06:12.663 --> 06:13.873
- Great. We're timing it.

06:13.956 --> 06:15.541
<i>- So, as our lobster's</i>
<i>cooking,</i>

06:15.625 --> 06:17.126
<i>let's address the salsas,</i>

06:17.210 --> 06:18.753
<i>which I think</i>
<i>will be a gentler subject.</i>

06:18.836 --> 06:20.296
[laughter]
<i>All right, so...</i>

06:20.379 --> 06:21.881
you should have some tomatillos

06:21.964 --> 06:23.966
and some beautiful
Roma tomatoes.

06:24.050 --> 06:25.176
- Okay.

06:25.259 --> 06:26.803
- Everyone say "tomatillos"
with me.

06:26.886 --> 06:29.138
all: Tomatillos.
- Oh, wow.

06:29.222 --> 06:31.724
<i>- So both of these salsas</i>
<i>have the same ingredients,</i>

06:31.808 --> 06:33.810
with the exception
of the tomato and tomatillo.

06:33.893 --> 06:35.269
One's green and one's red.

06:35.353 --> 06:37.313
<i>Selena, can you take</i>
<i>those tomatillos</i>

06:37.396 --> 06:38.940
<i>and peel the shells off?</i>
- Yes.

06:39.023 --> 06:41.234
- And then maybe get, like,
a little bowl of water

06:41.317 --> 06:43.319
<i>just to kind of get</i>
<i>some of that little funk off.</i>

06:43.402 --> 06:44.654
- Yeah. It's sticky.

06:44.737 --> 06:46.739
- And then, take those
Roma tomatoes

06:46.823 --> 06:48.950
and slice them right in half.
- Okay.

06:49.033 --> 06:51.160
- Put them on this tray,
flesh side up.

06:51.244 --> 06:53.371
Let's do four,
and let's go ahead

06:53.454 --> 06:55.123
and do the same thing
with the tomatillos.

06:55.206 --> 06:57.583
'Cause they're smaller,
I would do all the same amount

06:57.667 --> 06:59.502
<i>that you have there</i>
<i>cleaned, ladies.</i>

06:59.585 --> 07:00.711
- Okay.

07:00.795 --> 07:02.213
- Let's go ahead
and get some onion.

07:02.296 --> 07:03.506
- Red onion or white onion?

07:03.589 --> 07:05.007
- White onion.
- Okay.

07:05.091 --> 07:06.884
<i>- We're gonna take</i>
<i>some cloves and garlic.</i>

07:06.968 --> 07:09.053
- Oh, they're in the fridge.

07:09.137 --> 07:11.472
- And then get
those chili serranos.

07:11.556 --> 07:13.474
- Serranos.
<i>- Or jalapeño.</i>

07:13.558 --> 07:15.434
- Oh, we got a
new garlic container.

07:15.518 --> 07:17.520
- That's what you broke?
- Yeah.

07:17.603 --> 07:19.438
- Oh, this is a new--

07:19.522 --> 07:21.691
[glass shatters]
Oh.

07:21.774 --> 07:22.817
- Oh, my God.

07:22.900 --> 07:24.152
- She broke that.

07:24.235 --> 07:27.029
- So let's do one onion,
ladies, quartered.

07:27.113 --> 07:28.865
Look at you, Selena.
Go.

07:28.948 --> 07:30.116
<i>You go, girl.</i>
- Selena, go.

07:30.199 --> 07:31.284
- Thank you.

07:31.367 --> 07:33.744
- Selena Go...mez.
- No.

07:33.828 --> 07:35.079
- [laughs]

07:35.163 --> 07:37.248
- So each one of those trays

07:37.331 --> 07:39.041
is gonna get
the same ingredients.

07:39.125 --> 07:40.918
- And how many cloves?

07:41.002 --> 07:43.546
- Four or five cloves of garlic
for each tray.

07:43.629 --> 07:45.214
- Okay.
- Are we making salsa?

07:45.298 --> 07:47.216
- Yeah, he said that
in the beginning.

07:47.300 --> 07:49.177
- Where have you been?
- I just want to make sure.

07:49.260 --> 07:50.887
- Okay.
- Now, this is where it's gonna

07:50.970 --> 07:52.180
get interesting, okay?

07:52.263 --> 07:54.015
For the tomatillo,
for the green one,

07:54.098 --> 07:56.976
I'ma do one jalapeño
and one serrano.

07:57.059 --> 08:00.229
But you can do one serrano--
[all gasp]

08:00.313 --> 08:01.856
- It's okay, it's okay.
It's okay.

08:01.939 --> 08:03.566
- Oh, my God,
we've got an injury.

08:03.649 --> 08:05.610
- It's okay, it's okay.
- I'm gonna get a Band-Aid.

08:05.693 --> 08:07.403
- Are you okay?
- Totally.

08:07.486 --> 08:09.405
- She cut herself.
- Made my heart drop.

08:09.488 --> 08:11.324
- But also, she was so calm.

08:11.407 --> 08:12.950
- Take your time.
Take your time, mama.

08:13.034 --> 08:14.410
- Yeah, it's fine.

08:14.493 --> 08:16.621
<i>- You okay, honey?</i>
- Yes, I'm perfect.

08:16.704 --> 08:18.623
- So now that we have
our serranos,

08:18.706 --> 08:20.124
this is what
my tray looks like.

08:20.208 --> 08:22.043
<i>Can you see that, Selena?</i>
- Yes.

08:22.126 --> 08:24.086
<i>- You have the little fingers</i>
<i>tucked back?</i>

08:24.170 --> 08:25.421
- Yeah, I was trying.

08:25.504 --> 08:28.216
Do you mind?
<i>- Wonderful. Okay, cool.</i>

08:28.299 --> 08:31.594
<i>So now all we're gonna simply</i>
<i>do is let's season this, okay?</i>

08:31.677 --> 08:33.095
- Okay.

08:33.179 --> 08:36.265
- Take a little bit
of olive oil, salt and pepper.

08:36.349 --> 08:38.059
- Pepper I think
is right there.

08:38.142 --> 08:39.769
<i>- All right, wonderful.</i>

08:39.852 --> 08:43.773
And now, Selena, we're gonna go
into the oven with this--

08:43.856 --> 08:46.275
500 degrees,
rock and roll time.

08:46.359 --> 08:49.570
- ♪ How many people does it
take to open an oven? ♪

08:49.654 --> 08:51.072
- That's why
I've been sitting down.

08:51.155 --> 08:52.573
- So here's one thing
that we need to do

08:52.657 --> 08:54.951
to finish up
one of our salsas, okay?

08:55.034 --> 08:58.120
You should have these dried
chilies, these chili árbols.

08:58.204 --> 08:59.789
<i>Can you find those?</i>
- Yes.

08:59.872 --> 09:02.333
- Can you put, like,
a little small pot of water

09:02.416 --> 09:03.709
<i>and just get it boiling?</i>

09:03.793 --> 09:06.170
- I got you.
- I got my--

09:06.254 --> 09:07.838
What is it? Sous chef.

09:07.922 --> 09:09.423
- Sous chef.
- Sous chef.

09:09.507 --> 09:11.217
<i>- Sous chefs, exactly.</i>

09:11.300 --> 09:13.636
<i>So, while we're waiting</i>
<i>for that water to boil,</i>

09:13.719 --> 09:15.304
we're gonna revisit
our buddies, okay?

09:15.388 --> 09:17.557
- Oh, our buddies.
<i>- Let's grab them out</i>

09:17.640 --> 09:19.267
and put them
on that tray, okay?

09:19.350 --> 09:21.352
<i>You're doing great.</i>
- Oh, my gosh.

09:21.435 --> 09:24.397
- Good job, guys.
- Oh, my goodness.

09:24.480 --> 09:26.941
<i>- And right into the fridge,</i>
<i>ladies--or freezer, freezer.</i>

09:27.024 --> 09:29.527
- Go, go, go, go, go.
- Aah!

09:29.610 --> 09:30.820
Nice, Paige.

09:30.903 --> 09:32.780
- Now let's do
the same thing, ladies,

09:32.863 --> 09:34.323
with the shrimp.
- Yes.

09:34.407 --> 09:35.825
<i>- But be careful, Selena.</i>

09:35.908 --> 09:37.660
<i>Throw them in gently.</i>
<i>Don't splash it.</i>

09:37.743 --> 09:39.328
- You got it.

09:39.412 --> 09:42.456
- Now, these are gonna take
three to four minutes to cook.

09:42.540 --> 09:44.542
<i>Probably about five,</i>
<i>just to be safe.</i>

09:44.625 --> 09:45.793
- Bye, guys.

09:45.876 --> 09:48.296
- Let's start making
our ravigote,

09:48.379 --> 09:50.423
<i>which is this</i>
<i>really cool dressing</i>

09:50.506 --> 09:52.508
<i>that goes with crabmeat.</i>

09:52.591 --> 09:53.926
So, let's pull out a bowl.

09:54.010 --> 09:56.804
- I heard we're making
rabid goat salsa.

09:56.887 --> 09:59.974
- Let's pull out mayonnaise.
Let's pull out some mustard.

10:00.057 --> 10:02.351
- Yellow mustard
or spicy mustard?

10:02.435 --> 10:04.061
- The spicy mustard,
the creole mustard.

10:04.145 --> 10:05.813
<i>While you're fishing</i>
<i>for all that,</i>

10:05.896 --> 10:07.023
let's take out the shrimp.

10:07.106 --> 10:08.441
Shall we?
- Yes.

10:08.524 --> 10:10.109
- And they're gonna go right
into the freezer.

10:10.192 --> 10:12.278
- Aarón, when did you
start cooking?

10:12.361 --> 10:13.988
- I come from a cooking family.

10:14.071 --> 10:16.532
My mom had a restaurant
in New York City.

10:16.615 --> 10:19.493
<i>And I came to Louisiana</i>
<i>when I was very young</i>

10:19.577 --> 10:22.079
to learn from a very famous
chef named Paul Prudhomme.

10:22.163 --> 10:25.124
And he sort of formed
my opinions about food

10:25.207 --> 10:26.625
and life very much.

10:26.709 --> 10:28.669
You know, cooking has been
a fabric of my life,

10:28.753 --> 10:29.879
my whole time.

10:29.962 --> 10:31.380
I love taking care
of other people.

10:31.464 --> 10:33.341
<i>That's my jam.</i>
<i>It's my love language.</i>

10:33.424 --> 10:35.009
- I love that.
<i>- You know what I mean?</i>

10:35.092 --> 10:37.887
Now, Selena, I need you
to help me out and tell me

10:37.970 --> 10:40.723
<i>when that small pot</i>
<i>is boiling, okay?</i>

10:40.806 --> 10:42.433
- So it is baby boiling.

10:42.516 --> 10:45.227
- All right. Let's take
about four of those chilies

10:45.311 --> 10:47.646
and add it to
that water really quickly.

10:47.730 --> 10:49.065
- Three.
<i>- Turn off the heat</i>

10:49.148 --> 10:50.900
and just let them soak
with the lid on,

10:50.983 --> 10:52.902
'cause they're gonna get soft,
they're gonna get pliable

10:52.985 --> 10:55.154
<i>and it's gonna be easier</i>
<i>to make our salsa.</i>

10:55.237 --> 10:57.239
Now, let's work
with our ravigote.

10:57.323 --> 11:00.910
Let's do about 1/2 cup of mayo.

11:00.993 --> 11:02.703
- I'm totally eyeballing.

11:02.787 --> 11:04.830
- Now, two tablespoons
of mustard,

11:04.914 --> 11:06.665
one tablespoon of vinegar.

11:06.749 --> 11:09.085
And then your favorite
hot sauce.

11:09.168 --> 11:11.420
Add a couple sprinkles
of that in there.

11:11.504 --> 11:13.756
And now we're gonna add
a couple cracks of pepper.

11:13.839 --> 11:15.257
- Okay.

11:15.341 --> 11:17.426
- Some salt, lemon.

11:17.510 --> 11:19.095
This always works well.

11:19.178 --> 11:21.555
If not, you can use your hands.

11:21.639 --> 11:23.641
So now let's take some chives.
- Okay.

11:23.724 --> 11:25.726
- Slice them
as thin as you can.

11:25.810 --> 11:27.144
So maybe, like,
two tablespoons.

11:27.228 --> 11:29.021
- Ooh, nice.
- Good job.

11:29.105 --> 11:31.607
Look at that little wave.
- Thanks, guys.

11:31.690 --> 11:34.860
- At this point,
let's do a nice little mix.

11:34.944 --> 11:37.321
- This is so much fun.
<i>- Taste it.</i>

11:37.405 --> 11:39.448
<i>Tell me what you think.</i>

11:39.532 --> 11:41.492
- It's, like, good.

11:41.575 --> 11:43.160
both: It's really good.
- Yeah.

11:43.244 --> 11:45.871
- Oh, yeah.
We're in a good place here.

11:45.955 --> 11:48.082
<i>So let's take</i>
<i>some crabmeat, ladies.</i>

11:48.165 --> 11:49.291
- Ooh, crabmeat.

11:49.375 --> 11:52.128
- Mmm.
Sweet and beautiful.

11:52.211 --> 11:53.796
<i>Louisiana's in the house.</i>

11:53.879 --> 11:55.965
Put it all into that bowl.
- Oh.

11:56.048 --> 11:57.341
<i>- All of it in that bowl.</i>

11:57.425 --> 11:59.635
You want to gently
fold it in there

11:59.718 --> 12:01.429
and make sure
that wonderful ravigote

12:01.512 --> 12:03.597
is in every little crevice,
okay?

12:03.681 --> 12:04.682
- Ooh.
- All right.

12:04.765 --> 12:05.975
So let's put this to the side.

12:06.058 --> 12:07.643
Now, let's look
at our vegetables

12:07.726 --> 12:09.478
in the oven, shall we?
<i>- Yes.</i>

12:09.562 --> 12:10.938
- They should be nice
and charred.

12:11.021 --> 12:12.440
[smoke alarm beeping]

12:12.523 --> 12:14.150
<i>I'm gonna show you</i>
<i>what mine look like.</i>

12:14.233 --> 12:15.609
<i>So you can see</i>
<i>what you're trying to go for.</i>

12:15.693 --> 12:17.319
- So sorry.
The alarm's going off.

12:17.403 --> 12:20.489
- Oh, no.
- Help!

12:20.573 --> 12:23.075
<i>- This gets better</i>
<i>by the minute.</i>

12:23.159 --> 12:24.743
[beeping continues]
- Where is it?

12:24.827 --> 12:27.163
- I think it's coming
from when we opened the oven.

12:27.246 --> 12:29.999
[beeping continues]
- What am I doing with this?

12:30.082 --> 12:32.168
Like, what is this gonna do?

12:32.251 --> 12:34.503
- Oh, did we not turn the--

12:34.587 --> 12:37.006
- Oh, it stopped.
- You bring a pillow?

12:37.089 --> 12:40.092
- It's gonna do more--
- Ay.

12:40.176 --> 12:42.011
- [laughs]
Selena, you're doing great.

12:42.094 --> 12:43.596
- I feel like I need
a drink after that.

12:43.679 --> 12:45.139
- Yes, and I'll join you.

12:45.222 --> 12:46.724
- Perfect.
- Great.

12:46.807 --> 12:48.476
- 'Cause we're getting to
the finish line very shortly.

12:48.559 --> 12:50.186
- We're gonna have mimosas.
That's what we having.

12:50.269 --> 12:51.437
- Ooh, okay.

12:51.520 --> 12:53.063
- We'll have some orange juice
for Sel.

12:53.147 --> 12:54.523
- Should we put it in these?
- Yeah.

12:54.607 --> 12:56.358
- So let's take
those vegetables out.

12:56.442 --> 12:57.902
What do you think, Selena?
- Yes.

12:57.985 --> 12:59.653
<i>- They look great, guys.</i>
- Nice.

12:59.737 --> 13:01.197
<i>- While those</i>
<i>are cooling down,</i>

13:01.280 --> 13:03.365
let's take our lobster
out, okay?

13:03.449 --> 13:06.368
So make sure you guys
get your little mimosas on.

13:06.452 --> 13:08.787
<i>I'm gonna get ready for</i>
<i>the next little batch here.</i>

13:08.871 --> 13:11.582
<i>All right, so, we're gonna</i>
<i>make a sauce</i>

13:11.665 --> 13:13.250
<i>for the lobster ceviche.</i>

13:13.334 --> 13:16.212
We should need agave nectar...
- I got it.

13:16.295 --> 13:19.215
- Mango nectar or mango puree.

13:19.298 --> 13:21.133
- Oh, that's in the--
Yeah, in the jar.

13:21.217 --> 13:24.386
- We should need that mustard
again, that little Dijon.

13:24.470 --> 13:25.721
- Dijon.

13:25.804 --> 13:26.931
- Aji amarillo,

13:27.014 --> 13:28.557
which is
that chili puree from Peru.

13:28.641 --> 13:30.226
- We're missing
the chili paste.

13:30.309 --> 13:33.479
- That's it.
- This is yellow hot pepper.

13:33.562 --> 13:35.731
<i>- Yeah, that's it. That's it.</i>
- Oh, got it.

13:35.814 --> 13:38.692
- No one ever listens to me.
- There's a reason.

13:38.776 --> 13:40.819
<i>- Salud.</i> Wait till you see
how we put this together.

13:40.903 --> 13:42.780
<i>You're gonna be so impressed.</i>
- We're very excited.

13:42.863 --> 13:44.073
<i>- Hey.</i>
- All right, here we go.

13:44.156 --> 13:46.242
Yellow Peruvian chili paste.

13:46.325 --> 13:49.245
Let's do one nice
heaping spoonful.

13:49.328 --> 13:50.663
<i>Órale.</i>

13:50.746 --> 13:53.123
Same amount of mustard.

13:53.207 --> 13:55.543
And then we're gonna do
the same amount

13:55.626 --> 13:58.379
with the agave nectar.
- Okay.

13:58.462 --> 14:01.549
- We're gonna add
a little bit of salt.

14:01.632 --> 14:03.217
- Okay.

14:03.300 --> 14:05.261
- And then mix those
ingredients and start to add

14:05.344 --> 14:07.763
half of the amount
of mango nectar

14:07.846 --> 14:09.598
that you have there.

14:09.682 --> 14:11.976
Not too much. That's good,
that's good, that's good.

14:12.059 --> 14:14.728
Perfect.
Let's get one lime, ladies.

14:14.812 --> 14:17.773
And we're gonna use one of
these little contraptions here,

14:17.856 --> 14:20.276
<i>the microplane or zester.</i>
- Mm-hmm.

14:20.359 --> 14:23.821
- Just 1/3 amount. Okay?
- Okay.

14:23.904 --> 14:26.490
- Let's take that same lime

14:26.574 --> 14:29.577
and squeeze
all that juice into that sauce.

14:29.660 --> 14:31.954
Okay?
Now we're cooking with gas.

14:32.037 --> 14:34.290
So I'm gonna show something
that's very old school,

14:34.373 --> 14:36.250
which is called "supreming"

14:36.333 --> 14:38.544
or cutting segments
out of an orange.

14:38.627 --> 14:39.795
- Okay.

14:39.878 --> 14:41.589
- So just cut one end
of the orange--

14:41.672 --> 14:46.135
same thing on the other side,
so you have two flat ends.

14:46.218 --> 14:47.678
- Yes.

14:47.761 --> 14:52.600
- Now, run your knife right
on the outside of the skin

14:52.683 --> 14:54.977
but without going too much
into the actual citrus.

14:55.060 --> 14:56.437
- Okay.

14:56.520 --> 14:58.772
- Take your small knife,
and you're gonna literally

14:58.856 --> 15:02.985
just run your knife in between
those little segments.

15:03.068 --> 15:05.613
You see those little lines
in between each part of that?

15:05.696 --> 15:07.656
- Yes.
<i>- And it should come loose.</i>

15:07.740 --> 15:09.491
- Oh.
<i>- All right.</i>

15:09.575 --> 15:11.452
Once you get
a good amount of that done,

15:11.535 --> 15:14.121
kind of just chop them up
into smaller pieces, okay?

15:14.204 --> 15:15.998
- Okay.
- And then...

15:16.081 --> 15:18.834
add that to our mixing bowl.
- Okey-dokey.

15:18.917 --> 15:23.756
- And then to that, we're gonna
start to introduce the lobster.

15:23.839 --> 15:25.007
- Oh.

15:25.090 --> 15:26.800
And then we're gonna
finish our salsas,

15:26.884 --> 15:28.886
