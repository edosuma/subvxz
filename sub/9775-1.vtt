[ Narrator ]
My name is Chance.

00:32.272 --> 00:36.299
I know it sounds odd, but most names
do if you think about 'em long enough...

00:36.400 --> 00:38.343
maybe even yours.

00:38.448 --> 00:40.718
I was abandoned
when I was very young.

00:40.817 --> 00:44.265
I lived on the streets, scrounging
for food, sleeping wherever I could.

00:44.369 --> 00:46.377
That seemed like fun at first...

00:46.481 --> 00:48.653
but pretty soon
it landed me behind bars.

00:48.753 --> 00:52.201
- [ Gate Slamming Shut ]
- But I don't like to talk about that.

00:52.306 --> 00:55.787
Let's talk about after that
when I got my second chance...

00:55.890 --> 00:57.713
and my name.

00:57.811 --> 01:00.080
You see, this family came along...

01:00.179 --> 01:02.219
and, I guess you could say,
they rescued me...

01:02.323 --> 01:05.837
'cause they adopted me and brought me
to live with them at their house.

01:05.939 --> 01:08.874
But it was their home, not mine.

01:08.980 --> 01:12.842
Still, it sure was an improvement over,
well, over that other place.

01:12.949 --> 01:16.081
Lots of space, fresh air...

01:16.181 --> 01:18.603
plenty of interesting things
to explore...

01:18.710 --> 01:21.525
and all the underwear
I could eat.

01:25.110 --> 01:26.932
- [ Female Voice ] Chance.!
- Sassy?

01:27.030 --> 01:29.998
You've just woke me up
from a very deep catnap.

01:30.102 --> 01:32.852
What's the matter, Sassy? You get up
on the wrong side of the litter box?

01:32.951 --> 01:36.661
Even a very great beauty
needs her beauty sleep!

01:36.759 --> 01:40.142
Beauty sleep? You'd have
to sleep for like... a month.

01:40.247 --> 01:42.287
Oh, you are such
a typical dog.

01:42.392 --> 01:46.321
[ Chance ] Indeed. The house was
full of new clothes to be shredded...

01:46.424 --> 01:48.726
on account of
the family was growing.

01:48.825 --> 01:51.793
You see, Bob was joining
the family by marrying Laura.

01:51.897 --> 01:55.378
- Her little girl was Hope.
Hope belonged to Sassy.
-Jamie!

01:55.481 --> 01:59.606
The little boy,Jamie,
was supposed to belong to me,
but I didn't need anyone else.

01:59.706 --> 02:01.877
- I was a loner.
- Ew!

02:01.978 --> 02:04.367
[ Hope ]
Ew.!

02:04.474 --> 02:08.086
[ Chance ] Still, I had to admit it,
he did have a lot of very good ideas.

02:08.187 --> 02:10.195
He was the one
who named me Chance.

02:10.299 --> 02:13.366
Laura's older boy was Peter.

02:13.467 --> 02:16.021
He belonged to Shadow.
Shadow was faithful.

02:16.123 --> 02:18.906
Shadow was loyal.
Shadow was a chump.

02:19.004 --> 02:21.971
Hejust sat down there while
I had all the fun upstairs.

02:22.077 --> 02:25.558
Chance, stop!
The blouse is dead.

02:25.661 --> 02:27.734
That's right,
but I gotta shred it...

02:27.837 --> 02:32.028
into teeny, tiny little pieces,
and I really--

02:32.126 --> 02:34.133
[ Gulp ]
I swallowed a button.

02:34.238 --> 02:37.402
Oh, what a shame!
Too bad it wasn't a zipper.

02:37.502 --> 02:40.983
Hey, you better beat it, powder puff,
or you're gonna end up dog meat.

02:41.086 --> 02:44.283

to a petite dewdrop?

03:44.550 --> 03:46.689

an alfresco thing.

'cause I smelled it first.

mean anything to you?
- No. Why?

- [ Barking ]
- All right!Just wanted to smell it.

04:20.137 --> 04:23.783

Hey, gimme that Frisbee!
Here. Good boy, Chance.

11:35.900 --> 11:38.934
- How far can you throw that Frisbee?
- Pretty far.

11:39.037 --> 11:43.739
- Can you throw as far
as that field over there?
- Maybe you better do it.

11:46.333 --> 11:49.530
[ Growling ]
Hey! Hey! Hey!

11:49.630 --> 11:53.907
Hey.! Now look what you did.
You let it escape.

11:56.254 --> 11:59.451
[ Chance ] Don't worry.
I'll wrestle it to the ground...

11:59.551 --> 12:03.130
and chew it up so good it'll
never fly away again.
[ Chuckles ]

12:03.231 --> 12:07.804
I hope he doesn't
forget me.

12:07.904 --> 12:10.752
Okay!

12:14.209 --> 12:17.951
- I'm gonna miss you so much.
- I know.

12:18.049 --> 12:20.897
I know you're sad.
I wish I knew why.

12:20.993 --> 12:25.052
We'll be back to visit
next week, okay? I promise.

12:25.154 --> 12:27.674

What's wrong?

12:27.778 --> 12:30.047
[ Laura ]
Peter! It's time!

12:32.259 --> 12:35.456
[ Shadow ] Don't worry, Peter.
I'm here to protect you.

12:36.867 --> 12:39.006
Be a good dog.

12:39.107 --> 12:42.424
- Stay.
- [ Shadow ] Stay?

12:46.020 --> 12:48.835
- [ Sassy ] Hope, where are you going?
- Good-bye, Hope. Bye-bye.

All right, all right, all right.
Easy on the fur coat.

12:51.973 --> 12:56.480
I got it! I got it! It was crafty,
all right, but I--Jamie?

Peter. Wait.

13:03.079 --> 13:05.250
Stay.

Oh, no, not this.

Come on, guys. We're gonna be back
for a visit in a couple weeks.

13:41.259 --> 13:43.680
I thought we'd
be back next week.

13:43.787 --> 13:46.438
Yeah, Mom. I told Shadow
I'd see him next weekend.

13:46.540 --> 13:49.606
- Oh, honey, they don't
know the difference.
- Yes, they will.

13:49.708 --> 13:52.643
- You know we can't
come back every weekend.
- Two weeks then.

13:52.748 --> 13:54.658
It can't be any
longer, okay?

13:54.764 --> 13:56.837
Okay. Two weeks.
It's a deal.

13:56.941 --> 14:00.738
- Cross your heart?
- Cross my heart.

14:00.844 --> 14:03.365
I just don't understand.

14:03.470 --> 14:06.699
Who are you gonna get
to watch over you?

14:06.798 --> 14:10.475
Who's gonna wait for you
to come home from school?

Who's gonna sleep
at the foot of your bed?

14:13.423 --> 14:15.911
You'll come back.

it's your turn. Okay.

- You're supposed to warm it up.
- Come on, girl. I'm so sorry.

- Come on. Okay, come on.
- It's cold.

Well, don't expect
a big tip from me.

I feel I'm going
to be sick.

Excuse me, but I'm
the new chicken monitor here.

the weird stuff they got around here.

They got this bird the
size of a Rottweiler.

ran over his head.

how little you know.

- A cat would know better.

to be faithful, loyal and true.

might as well humor them.

That's peculiar.

19:33.619 --> 19:36.402
[ Whining ]

19:38.003 --> 19:40.524
Locked in.
I hate being locked in.

19:40.628 --> 19:43.148
This is just like it was
back at the pound.

19:43.252 --> 19:45.772
- Chance, calm down.
- You don't get it, do ya?

19:45.877 --> 19:48.495
The pound is where humans lock you up
when they don't want you anymore.

19:48.597 --> 19:51.761
- Not want me? Impossible.
- Don't listen to him.

19:51.861 --> 19:53.684
He's just makin' it up
to scare you.

19:53.781 --> 19:57.295
Oh, yeah. You two pampered pets haven't
been out on the streets like I have.

19:57.398 --> 20:01.196
I've been to the pound, remember?
Don't tell me there's no pound.

20:01.302 --> 20:03.506
I know about the pound.

20:03.607 --> 20:07.983
Something doesn't smell right.
They've been gone way too long.

20:08.087 --> 20:11.436
Much longer than they should've been.
Something's really wrong.

20:11.544 --> 20:15.025
- Wake up and smell the kibble.
They dumped us.
- No! It isn't true!

20:15.128 --> 20:17.943
- They love you, and they dump you.
- Not Peter!

20:18.040 --> 20:22.645
You could be right, Shadow.
It's-- It's been too much time,
way too much time.

20:22.745 --> 20:25.876
Something is keeping Peter from coming
to me, so I'm gonna go to him.

20:25.977 --> 20:30.484
- You guys kill me. She
locked the gate, remember?
- I don't care about gates.

20:32.154 --> 20:33.813

- No way!

It's too far.
You don't know the way.

What if they come back here
looking for us?

20:48.572 --> 20:51.507
It's time to go, Sassy.
I'm going home.

It's crazy!
Who'll feed you?

20:53.852 --> 20:57.944

and take you to the pound!

We'll be there before dark.

21:33.537 --> 21:36.571
How do you figure?
It took us ages to get this far.

21:36.673 --> 21:40.536
That was the long way.
We'll take the shortcut,
straight up and over.

21:40.641 --> 21:44.024
Hey! Wait up!
Hey, guys, wait up!

21:44.130 --> 21:48.025
- Here I am.
- I thought you were gonna stay, pup.

21:48.130 --> 21:51.000
I thought I better come along
in case you two needed protection.

21:51.107 --> 21:55.264
[ Sassy ] My hero.
Guess I'm gonna have to stare
at your butt the whole way.

I'll race you to the trees.

22:05.381 --> 22:07.999
to over 250 miles
north and south...

and to over 50 miles
east and west.

22:11.141 --> 22:15.201
This makes them the second
largest mountain range in
the Western United States.

22:19.782 --> 22:23.525
- [ Sassy ] Ow.! I broke a nail.!
- Not much further now.

22:23.623 --> 22:26.471
I think Little Miss Fur Ball
needs a rest, don't you think?

22:26.567 --> 22:29.797
What's the matter, pup?
Too much for a tough guy like you?

22:29.896 --> 22:33.638
What are you talkin' about?
I'm just sick of hearin' her whine.

22:33.736 --> 22:36.998
This ground isn't nearly
soft enough. Ah! Ah!

22:37.096 --> 22:41.919
- Almost there, Sassy.
- I hate these package tours.

23:00.747 --> 23:03.169
That's funny.

You gotta be kiddin' me.

23:25.582 --> 23:29.194
- [ Braying ]
- Okay, okay. I know
you're hungry. I'm comin'!

23:30.831 --> 23:35.206
I wanna be home where the tallest thing
I have to climb is a bookshelf.

23:35.311 --> 23:39.468
Top's just ahead. You'll be able to see
our house from there. Keep marching.

23:39.568 --> 23:43.113
Don't worry. I'm gonna be glad
to put this place behind me.

23:43.216 --> 23:45.966
First of all, there's way too many
new smells to learn.

23:46.064 --> 23:50.342
Not to mention, I got about
ten million trees to mark,
and I am running on empty.

23:50.449 --> 23:52.489
Finally.

23:52.593 --> 23:56.270
Oh, Shadow.

23:56.369 --> 23:59.086
Whoa!
Get a load of this.

24:05.330 --> 24:08.048
You could see everything
from up here.

24:08.146 --> 24:11.376
Except the house. I don't see
the house. Where's the house?

24:11.475 --> 24:14.126
[ Sassy ]
Well, thank you, Shadow.

24:14.227 --> 24:16.562
It's been simply
a divine vacation...

24:16.660 --> 24:19.889
but I think I'll just stay here
and wait for the bus.

24:19.988 --> 24:22.192

01:04:07.591 --> 01:04:10.242
- [ Sassy ] Well, that may be, but--
- Hey, hang on just a minute.

01:04:10.343 --> 01:04:12.131
- Come on. Let's go, guys.
- No, wait.

01:04:12.231 --> 01:04:17.087
- What is it, Shadow?
- I don't know. I got a
funny feeling all of a sudden.

01:04:17.192 --> 01:04:21.535
Like something's telling me
to go back the other way.

01:04:21.640 --> 01:04:25.503
- Strange, huh?
- What, back to the pound?
What is he, crazy?

01:04:25.608 --> 01:04:27.583
[ Shadow ]
Yeah, you're right.

01:04:43.915 --> 01:04:47.396
[ Narrator ]
Shadow and Sassy had
risked their lives for me.

01:04:47.499 --> 01:04:50.249
I never knew I'd
have friends like that.

01:04:50.348 --> 01:04:53.315
The feeling was all
very new to me.

01:04:53.420 --> 01:04:57.577
I liked it.

01:04:57.677 --> 01:05:00.612
[ Thunderclap ]

01:05:00.716 --> 01:05:04.164
I'm sorry this worked
out this way, sir.

01:05:04.269 --> 01:05:06.790
Yeah, me too.
Thanks.

01:05:08.942 --> 01:05:11.812
Let's keep looking, Mom.
They werejust here.!

01:05:11.918 --> 01:05:13.926
Honey,
that was hours ago.

01:05:14.030 --> 01:05:17.326
I mean, they could be
miles away by now.

01:05:17.423 --> 01:05:22.093
Listen to me, the people here have
promised to do everything they can.

01:05:22.192 --> 01:05:25.967
And, and they'll call us
the minute they get word.

01:05:27.792 --> 01:05:30.313
We came so close
to gettin' 'em back.

01:05:30.416 --> 01:05:33.581
[ Bob ]
At least we know they're alive.

01:05:33.680 --> 01:05:38.732
If the animals made it this far,
they might make it all the way home.

01:05:38.833 --> 01:05:43.023
- [ Peter ] Shadow.!
- We can't give up.

01:05:44.402 --> 01:05:48.177
Shadow!

01:05:48.274 --> 01:05:50.576
Shadow!

01:05:56.563 --> 01:06:00.720
[ Chance ] We goin' in circles?
That tree smells familiar.

01:06:00.820 --> 01:06:03.373
- Of course it does. It's pine.
- Oh.

01:06:06.580 --> 01:06:08.947
[ Gasp ]
Hurry up!

01:06:09.044 --> 01:06:13.201
Oh, look, you guys.
We made it!

01:06:19.382 --> 01:06:24.784
Wow! Shadow, this is incredible.
You were right all along.

01:06:24.887 --> 01:06:27.636
Oh, isn't that the most
beautiful sight you ever saw?

01:06:27.734 --> 01:06:31.696
Come on, you two,
let's go home.

01:06:36.183 --> 01:06:39.861
[ Narrator ] Even now I don't
really know how he did it.

01:06:39.961 --> 01:06:42.165
But there we were,
finally...

01:06:42.264 --> 01:06:45.974
looking down at the road
that would lead us home.

01:06:52.730 --> 01:06:56.025
[ Shadow ]
Home is just beyond these tracks.

01:06:56.122 --> 01:06:58.065
We should be there
before dark.

01:06:58.170 --> 01:07:00.920
- [ Sassy ] I've heard that before.
-Just be very careful.

01:07:01.019 --> 01:07:04.500
[ Train Horn Blowing ]

01:07:07.707 --> 01:07:10.009
[ Train Horn Blowing ]

01:07:10.108 --> 01:07:14.134
Come on, you two.
Watch carefully where
you're going. Look both ways.

01:07:15.900 --> 01:07:18.267
- Stay with me. Hurry up.
- Not so fast.

01:07:18.365 --> 01:07:21.529
Come on, hurry up.

01:07:21.629 --> 01:07:24.084
Come on! Come on!

01:07:24.189 --> 01:07:26.164
I'm coming!
Wait up!

01:07:28.414 --> 01:07:30.586
You all right, Sass?

01:07:30.686 --> 01:07:33.108
Me? I laugh at danger.

01:07:33.215 --> 01:07:36.564
Me too, but I'll laugh later.
Let's get outta here.

01:07:36.670 --> 01:07:38.940
I'm so sick of nature
I could puke.

01:07:39.039 --> 01:07:41.177
After this I intend to live
indoors on a velvet cushion...

01:07:41.279 --> 01:07:44.891
filled with bird feathers and be served
filet of mouse on a silver platter--

01:07:44.992 --> 01:07:48.702
All right, Sassy.
We're nearly home. Come on--

- Are you okay?

01:08:21.764 --> 01:08:26.237
Yeah. My leg hurts
pretty badly.

01:08:26.340 --> 01:08:31.229
- Is it broken?
- I don't know. It's hard to move it.

01:08:31.332 --> 01:08:35.938
Hey, hey, look at this.
It's not as steep over here, Shadow.

01:08:36.037 --> 01:08:39.267
- Maybe you can climb out here.
- I'll try.

- Yeah, that's it.

That's it.
Great, keep comin'.

- Come on. If you can jump
in a river to save me...

01:08:56.392 --> 01:08:59.207
this should be easy.!

01:08:59.304 --> 01:09:01.792
Yeah, that's right. And after outrunning
a mountain lion! Come on.

- That's good.!

you need, Chance.

is how to say good-bye.

found out that sacrifice...

and friendship
and even love...
