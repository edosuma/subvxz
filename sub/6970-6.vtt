00:07.440 --> 00:09.533
Miss Holland, l'm Nurse Waite.

00:09.609 --> 00:12.339
l'll be assisting in your procedure.

00:12.979 --> 00:14.378
Will it hurt?

00:14.614 --> 00:16.878
You won't feel a thing. There's no blood.

00:16.950 --> 00:19.942
Dr Lloyd's done over a thousand
lipo procedures.

00:20.387 --> 00:22.378
You're in good hands.

00:25.025 --> 00:27.016
OK, here we go.

00:33.700 --> 00:36.567
l'm going to give you a tranquilizer now,

00:36.636 --> 00:40.834
then the doctor will give you injections
of saline and anesthetic.

00:40.907 --> 00:44.570
All you have to worry about
is buying a new wardrobe.

00:50.984 --> 00:53.919
Your liposuction patient is prepped
and in room five.

00:53.987 --> 00:56.615
Fine. What else am l scheduled for?

00:56.689 --> 00:59.817
You've got a scalp reduction
and a blepharoplasty.

00:59.959 --> 01:01.824
Are they prepped?

01:01.995 --> 01:05.590
- No. Would you like...?
- Get them ready, please.

01:05.665 --> 01:08.031
l'd like to move right along today.

01:08.101 --> 01:10.035
Yes, doctor.

01:12.000 --> 01:18.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:13.933 --> 02:15.867
How are you doing?

02:15.935 --> 02:21.202
ls the doctor going to be much longer?
l think my tranquilizer's starting to wear off.

02:21.274 --> 02:24.004
l'm sorry. l don't know where...

02:57.443 --> 02:58.967
Dr Lloyd!

03:01.648 --> 03:05.277
l think this patient is finished.

03:52.999 --> 03:55.194
What else do you call it?

03:55.268 --> 03:58.635
When you're in your body
and out of it at the same time,

03:58.705 --> 04:01.435
unable to control your actions,

04:01.507 --> 04:05.705
to stop yourself from doing
what l did to that poor man?

04:06.846 --> 04:10.907
- What else do you call it?
- Spirit possession or demon possession?

04:12.185 --> 04:15.916
While these mental states
have been well documented,

04:15.989 --> 04:21.928
they've been much maligned and haven't
held up in court well as a criminal defense.

04:22.028 --> 04:25.464
l have advised my client
against speaking to you.

04:25.531 --> 04:30.230
l'd appreciate it if you would direct
any legal discussion to counsel.

04:30.870 --> 04:34.203
Dr Lloyd, are you taking
any kind of medication?

04:34.274 --> 04:38.233
The odd sleeping pill
and a prescription antacid for my stomach.

04:38.311 --> 04:40.939
Would you mind
if l check the dosage and which ones?

04:41.014 --> 04:42.572
No, l really...

04:42.649 --> 04:45.277
l would like to know why...

04:45.952 --> 04:48.648
You've got a clear picture
of my client's story

04:49.055 --> 04:52.752
and his willingness to go along
with your investigation.

04:54.394 --> 04:56.021
Yes, l believe we have.

04:57.563 --> 05:00.691
Dr Lloyd,
you say that you've taken sleeping pills.

05:00.933 --> 05:03.026
How much sleep
did you get the night before?

05:08.341 --> 05:11.174
l can't recall.

05:21.187 --> 05:24.020
The sleeping pill he was taking
was called Somanil.

05:24.090 --> 05:25.057
l've heard of it.

05:25.124 --> 05:30.721
lt works directly on the central nervous
system and it isn't stored in body tissue.

05:30.797 --> 05:35.734
But it's controversial for its addictiveness
and its effect on long-term behavior.

05:35.968 --> 05:39.699
What was the date of Dr Lloyd's prescription?

05:40.673 --> 05:43.904
He started taking it five years ago,
and went through...

05:43.976 --> 05:47.605
He took a lot of it: 19 100-tablet refills.

05:57.323 --> 06:00.986
- That's more than a pill a day.
- An addiction, in other words.

06:01.060 --> 06:05.360
An addiction which very well could have
altered his ability to do his job.

06:05.431 --> 06:08.457
How many of these procedures
would you say he's performed?

06:08.534 --> 06:11.059
Judging from his schedule
the day of the accident,

06:11.137 --> 06:13.503
hundreds, and probably thousands.

06:13.573 --> 06:15.598
And not one fatality.

06:15.675 --> 06:20.078
You're missing my point, Mulder.
This place is a veritable factory.

06:20.146 --> 06:26.107
Cosmetic surgery is a boom industry.
ASU wards like this are a gold mine.

06:26.652 --> 06:29.086
Everybody's doing it, so l hear.

06:29.155 --> 06:33.785
A brand-new, state-of-the-art facility like this
can support an entire hospital.

06:36.028 --> 06:38.895
- What do you suppose these are?
- What?

06:38.965 --> 06:42.492
These five marks on your brand-new,
state-of-the-art floor.

06:42.568 --> 06:46.504
They look like they were made
by the coasters from an OR table

06:46.572 --> 06:48.540
or some kind of equipment.

06:48.608 --> 06:51.668
They look to me
like they were burned or scorched.

07:00.186 --> 07:02.882
lt's the shape of a pentagram.

07:07.026 --> 07:10.894
lf you want to connect the dots here,
you should look at the facts.

07:10.963 --> 07:17.596
latrogenic deaths or deaths due
to doctor error are upwards of 80,000 a year.

07:17.670 --> 07:21.902
Dr Lloyd was pushing his limits.
He was an accident waiting to happen.

07:21.974 --> 07:27.378
l'm not a doctor, but you've got to be pushing
hard to mistake a beer belly for a bald head,

07:27.447 --> 07:30.041
not to mention door number three.

07:37.623 --> 07:40.558
lt's amazing that no one saw him
in time to stop him.

07:40.626 --> 07:42.719
Maybe they were all possessed.

07:42.795 --> 07:45.229
l don't think it's a simple possession.

07:45.298 --> 07:50.031
l think it's more like sorcery
or black magic or something like that.

07:50.102 --> 07:52.935
Excuse me.
What kind of procedure is that up there?

07:53.005 --> 07:55.496
lt's a rhinoplasty. l'm sorry, who are you?

07:55.575 --> 07:59.011
We're with the FBl.
l'm Agent Scully and this is Agent Mulder.

07:59.078 --> 08:01.410
We're investigating a patient's death here.

08:02.682 --> 08:03.671
Yes.

08:04.050 --> 08:07.918
You're Rebecca Waite. You were
the attending nurse at the time?

08:07.987 --> 08:08.851
Yes.

08:08.921 --> 08:13.358
Can you explain what happened,
how a mistake like this could happen?

08:13.893 --> 08:16.453
No. No, l can't really.

08:16.996 --> 08:22.400
l wasn't in the OR at the time and...
it's difficult for me in my position.

08:23.336 --> 08:26.863
Did you observe Dr Lloyd at all
before the accident?

08:27.273 --> 08:30.731
l helped prep the patient.
l was supposed to assist.

08:30.810 --> 08:32.744
l did my job as a nurse.

08:33.846 --> 08:38.749
Are you aware that Dr Lloyd is claiming
he was possessed during the incident?

08:41.921 --> 08:45.220
l guess it's cheaper
than malpractice insurance.

08:48.761 --> 08:52.925
Give him 500ccs of Ringer's wide open
before he goes to Recovery.

08:52.999 --> 08:56.025
- l need you to keep up with me.
- Right away, Dr Shannon.

08:56.102 --> 08:58.366
Dr Shannon, can we have a word, please?

08:58.437 --> 09:01.372
l've got a patient who can't wait.

09:06.579 --> 09:09.480
There's magic going on here, Mulder,

09:09.916 --> 09:14.319
only it's being done with silicone,
collagen and a well-placed scalpel.

09:26.599 --> 09:31.764
What we have to do here is keep calm
and do nothing out of the ordinary.

09:31.837 --> 09:37.707
The appearance of any impropriety
will only deepen the FBl's probe,

09:37.777 --> 09:40.473
on top of Dr Lloyd's insurance investigation.

09:40.546 --> 09:43.071
Dr Lloyd has made us a target.

09:43.149 --> 09:46.016
The last thing we need
is to be caught up in an exposÃ©.

09:46.085 --> 09:48.019
Then they look at our books again.

09:48.087 --> 09:52.353
lt's bad enough we have to explain why
buttock liposculptures cost 4,000 a pop.

09:52.425 --> 09:55.690
We look greedy, therefore we look guilty.

09:56.095 --> 09:59.587
We haven't done anything wrong, Dr lllaqua.

09:59.665 --> 10:04.693
lf we give any credence or credibility to
Dr Lloyd's story, they'll burn us at the stake.

10:04.770 --> 10:09.571
What about the other personnel?
They were talking to the nurse, Waite.

10:10.409 --> 10:12.604
She can't tell them anything

10:13.679 --> 10:16.341
because she doesn't know anything.

10:19.185 --> 10:21.415
l can't feel my feet.

10:22.855 --> 10:25.221
l'm having a skin peel,

10:26.025 --> 10:28.220
but l can't feel my feet.

10:28.294 --> 10:29.659
lt's OK. lt's OK.

10:29.729 --> 10:33.130
Your feet are still there.
They aren't goin' anywhere.

10:33.199 --> 10:35.565
lt's, it's just...

10:35.901 --> 10:38.734
l'm afraid to be put to sleep.

10:39.205 --> 10:41.639
What if l don't wake up?

10:41.707 --> 10:44.403
Not to worry. Not to worry.

10:44.477 --> 10:46.741
l want you to relax

10:46.979 --> 10:51.075
and think about your beautiful new face.

10:51.150 --> 10:54.244
You're in good hands.

11:00.092 --> 11:01.957
We're going to protect you.

11:13.339 --> 11:16.968
- You wanted to show me something?
- Yeah, a videotape.

11:18.678 --> 11:22.876
This video shows that
the five marks delineating the pentagram

11:22.948 --> 11:26.042
were in evidence prior to the patient's death.

11:26.118 --> 11:27.449
Stop it a second.

11:28.954 --> 11:32.549
My God, he basically
stabbed the man to death in his sleep.

11:32.625 --> 11:34.388
Which underscores the strangeness.

11:34.460 --> 11:38.396
A sane man acting under his own volition
could never perform such an act.

11:38.464 --> 11:39.863
Look.

11:41.434 --> 11:42.628
There.

11:42.702 --> 11:45.728
Presuming that has anything to do with this,
who put them there?

11:45.971 --> 11:49.134
l don't know. A pentagram
is meant to be a symbol of protection,

11:49.208 --> 11:51.142
used to control the elemental forces.

11:51.210 --> 11:54.373
- Then it doesn't make sense.
- But it makes sense that witchcraft

11:54.447 --> 11:58.975
would find a theater in a place like this,
preying on the weak and vainglorious.

11:59.051 --> 12:02.179
But there's no other evidence
of witchcraft taking place here.

12:02.788 --> 12:06.519
Maybe there is. What was that prescription
that Dr Lloyd was taking?

12:06.592 --> 12:08.992
- The sleeping pills?
- No, the stomach antacid.

12:09.061 --> 12:11.052
Read me what it's made from.

12:12.498 --> 12:16.366
''An antispasmodic - active ingredients
include belladonna alkaloids...''

12:16.435 --> 12:20.872
Belladonna - also known as witch's berry.
That's an herb used in hexing rituals.

12:20.940 --> 12:24.341
Do you know how many pharmaceuticals
contain belladonna?

12:24.410 --> 12:26.935
Yeah, just the one Dr Lloyd was taking.

12:27.012 --> 12:31.881
lf it's that simple, why don't you put out
an APB for someone riding a broom?

12:33.519 --> 12:38.456
You jest, but there's a good chance
that this hex or ritual may not be finished.

12:44.697 --> 12:49.066
The FBl seems to have backed off,
at least for the time being.

12:49.135 --> 12:50.261
Yes.

12:50.336 --> 12:52.930
- Are you finished for the day?
- Yes.

12:53.005 --> 12:56.406
l've got a laser peel. Then l'm outta here.

12:57.009 --> 13:02.106
We're gonna get through this, Eric. All we
have to do is keep our heads on straight.

13:03.682 --> 13:06.879
The patient's prepped.
ls there anything l can do?

13:06.952 --> 13:10.581
Yes, l'm gonna need
a clean pair of scrubs from the laundry.

13:10.656 --> 13:12.590
l'll get them now.

13:12.658 --> 13:15.183
ls there anything you need, Dr lllaqua?

13:15.261 --> 13:17.525
No, thank you.

13:37.750 --> 13:42.210
- Am l prepped in another room?
- No, your patient's in OR two.

13:42.288 --> 13:44.222
Who's that?

13:46.625 --> 13:50.254
That's Dr lllaqua.
What the hell is he doing with my patient?

13:52.097 --> 13:53.462
Dr lllaqua!

13:53.866 --> 13:56.027
Open this door!

13:56.602 --> 13:59.867
Eric, open this door immediately!

14:00.539 --> 14:02.666
Dr lllaqua, do you hear me?

14:02.908 --> 14:05.342
You've got to stop this now!

14:05.411 --> 14:07.675
This is wrong! What are you doing?

14:10.683 --> 14:13.345
Eric! Open this door immediately!

14:13.419 --> 14:15.683
This is Dr Shannon!

14:15.754 --> 14:19.417
l said stop this now! Stop!

14:22.928 --> 14:25.954
You don't remember anything, Dr lllaqua?

14:26.031 --> 14:29.865
How you got in the room
or what compelled you to do such a thing?

14:30.169 --> 14:32.899
No. l was on my way home.

14:35.941 --> 14:38.409
Do you realize what you've done now?

14:39.245 --> 14:40.212
Yes.

14:46.852 --> 14:47.784
May l?

14:56.228 --> 14:58.321
l'll be right back.

15:25.524 --> 15:27.458
Did you examine the victim?

15:27.526 --> 15:30.290
No, just Dr lllaqua. Why?

15:30.362 --> 15:32.694
l found something else on the videotape.

15:45.077 --> 15:46.772
Right there.

15:49.114 --> 15:50.342
What are they, bruises?

15:50.416 --> 15:55.649
l don't know, but the orientation of
the points describes a pentagram again. See?

15:57.256 --> 16:00.157
Well, l found something too.

16:01.226 --> 16:03.353
That's the same prescription as Dr Lloyd.

16:03.429 --> 16:06.364
You think it's just a coincidence?

16:06.432 --> 16:08.423
Yeah.

16:10.002 --> 16:12.436
Any change in scheduling or workload

16:12.504 --> 16:15.632
is going to give the appearance
of covering guilt.

16:15.708 --> 16:18.609
We can't compromise our position on this.

16:20.346 --> 16:23.110
Sorry to barge in,
but this is a matter of urgency.

16:23.182 --> 16:27.619
No, please. l'm Dr Jack Franklin.
May we ask you to sit down?

16:27.920 --> 16:30.582
lt appears we've interrupted a gathering.

16:30.656 --> 16:32.317
Gathering?

16:32.391 --> 16:36.919
Sir, can you imagine this group's concern
about what's happened,

16:36.996 --> 16:39.521
and our urgency to resolve this

16:39.598 --> 16:43.432
and to finally bring
the person responsible to justice?

16:43.936 --> 16:44.834
Finally?

16:48.807 --> 16:51.298
l don't know how much of this you know,

16:51.877 --> 16:54.107
but ten years ago,

16:54.179 --> 16:58.673
there were several deaths
at this hospital, here in the ASU,

16:58.751 --> 17:01.276
and, like the recent deaths,

17:01.353 --> 17:03.548
they were all ruled accidental.

17:03.622 --> 17:07.455
- Were any of you here at the time?
- A few of us, yes, but

17:08.594 --> 17:10.585
more importantly,

17:11.030 --> 17:13.828
there's a nurse, Rebecca Waite.

17:13.898 --> 17:16.992
She was on the ward during those incidents.

17:17.502 --> 17:21.233
Six weeks ago,
she transferred back here to the ASU.

17:21.839 --> 17:24.900
Do you have any other reasons
to suspect her?

17:24.977 --> 17:27.877
She's the only person who had some contact

17:27.945 --> 17:31.279
with each of the victims
and the doctors involved.

17:31.884 --> 17:35.115
- Have you spoken with her?
- No, she left early,

17:35.187 --> 17:37.519
and no one's been able to find her.

19:34.940 --> 19:36.840
Probable cause.

19:36.909 --> 19:39.139
Under suspicion of being a witch?

20:07.339 --> 20:09.034
Mulder.

20:18.250 --> 20:20.548
What could she have been doing in here?

20:20.619 --> 20:23.213
Probably not tax returns.

22:59.344 --> 23:03.246
You have reached the 911 emergency line.
Please stay on the line.

23:23.068 --> 23:26.560
You don't know what you're doing.
Let me go! They don't understand.

23:26.638 --> 23:28.936
- You have to tell them.
- l want to speak to her.

23:29.007 --> 23:31.202
- Tell them!
- Mulder, don't.

23:31.276 --> 23:33.608
l tried to stop him, but it's too powerful.

23:33.678 --> 23:35.669
Someone has to stop...

23:45.157 --> 23:47.057
Get the paramedics over here.

23:48.660 --> 23:51.288
Get the paramedics over here now!

24:03.074 --> 24:06.168
She swallowed straight pins
and is bleeding internally.

24:06.244 --> 24:08.508
Get her into surgery immediately.

24:08.580 --> 24:10.445
There you go.

24:13.018 --> 24:15.179
l'm going with her to the ER.

24:35.640 --> 24:35.774
l would have done it myself,

24:35.774 --> 24:38.038
l would have done it myself,

24:39.077 --> 24:40.874
but l'm still a little shaky.

24:41.079 --> 24:44.310
Jack, you're a lot cooler
than l'd be if it'd been me.

24:47.118 --> 24:49.109
Well, the important thing is

24:50.088 --> 24:51.578
it's over now.

24:51.656 --> 24:53.556
Dr Franklin?

24:56.294 --> 24:57.318
Agent Mulder.

24:57.395 --> 25:01.991
- l came to see if you were OK.
- Yes, l'm fine. Thank you.

25:02.801 --> 25:06.567
That woman broke in.
She was in here waiting for him.

25:06.638 --> 25:10.734
- Looks like she took a good shot at you.
- Yes, apparently.

25:12.010 --> 25:16.379
Nothing that a little plastic surgery
won't fix up, though, huh?

25:16.448 --> 25:19.611
Do you have any idea
why she might have attacked you?

25:20.252 --> 25:23.016
l'm the one who voiced suspicion about her.

25:23.722 --> 25:27.419
- She wouldn't have known that.
- lt could've been any of us. She's mad.

25:27.492 --> 25:30.950
We have reason to believe
she's a practitioner of ritual magic.

25:31.029 --> 25:33.554
- Ritual magic?
- A practicing witch.

25:35.100 --> 25:38.866
She's responsible
for Dr Lloyd and Dr lllaqua?

25:38.937 --> 25:42.373
Witchcraft caused them
to kill those patients?

25:42.774 --> 25:45.709
l think a lot remains to be proven.

25:46.411 --> 25:48.379
l'm sorry.

25:48.446 --> 25:52.542
This evening has been a bit much,
and l really need to get some rest.

25:53.051 --> 25:56.214
l think all of us would like to get some rest,

25:56.288 --> 25:58.552
get back to work and

25:59.024 --> 26:00.719
put this behind us.

27:02.420 --> 27:05.412
- Mulder, it's me.
- Come in. lt's open.

27:09.928 --> 27:13.364
- God, you look tired.
- l do?

27:15.900 --> 27:20.337
l was at the hospital. Our suspect, Rebecca
Waite, was pronounced 20 minutes ago.

27:20.405 --> 27:21.929
Cause of death?

27:22.407 --> 27:25.308
Massive blood loss due to hemorrhaging

27:25.377 --> 27:29.177
caused by the expulsion
of hundreds of straight pins.

27:29.247 --> 27:31.545
You ever see anything like that?

27:31.616 --> 27:35.643
Well, in med school l saw some weird stuff.

27:36.054 --> 27:39.251
There's a psychiatric disorder called pica,

27:39.324 --> 27:44.660
which is characterized by the craving
for nonfood objects like clay, rocks, glue.

27:45.664 --> 27:49.691
- But if she swallowed...
- She would have died long before that.

27:49.768 --> 27:55.331
Unless she didn't ingest them, which would
fit with a phenomenon called allotriophagy.

27:56.408 --> 28:00.174
- Allotriophagy?
- Spontaneous vomiting or disgorgement

28:00.245 --> 28:04.648
of foul or strange objects, usually
associated with someone possessed.

28:04.716 --> 28:08.049
l won't refute that this woman
was practicing the occult,

28:08.119 --> 28:10.815
but what comes out must first go in.

28:10.889 --> 28:13.949
According to this book,
people have coughed up things

28:14.025 --> 28:17.688
from cue balls to knives with
no explanation of how they got there.

28:17.929 --> 28:20.557
- Where'd you get this from?
- Rebecca Waite's house.

28:20.632 --> 28:22.623
lt's the same place l got this.

28:25.070 --> 28:29.268
This calendar was open at April.
The 30th is marked by a familiar symbol.

28:29.340 --> 28:31.399
What's the significance of the 30th?

28:31.476 --> 28:34.468
lt's one of the four greater witches' sabbaths.

28:34.546 --> 28:39.006
lt's also known as Roodmas.
lt's also the birth date of the first victim.

28:40.552 --> 28:42.486
Now, July 31st

28:44.422 --> 28:46.890
is also marked with a pentagram.

28:46.958 --> 28:50.086
This coincides with Lammas,
another witches' sabbath.

28:50.161 --> 28:52.391
lt's the birth date of the second victim.

28:52.464 --> 28:54.989
She was choosing victims
based on their birthdays?

28:55.066 --> 28:58.558
No, no. Remember,
l said the pentagram is a protective symbol.

28:58.636 --> 29:02.299
l think Rebecca Waite was trying to save
them. l think she knew they were in danger.

29:02.373 --> 29:06.275
- Which made her attack Dr Franklin.
- She knew something about him,

29:06.344 --> 29:10.303
and we should find out what that is
before he goes back to work.

29:13.518 --> 29:15.850
- l just got a disturbing call.
- From whom?

29:15.920 --> 29:20.289
The FBl. They were asking
about patients' birth dates.

29:21.159 --> 29:22.626
They're on their way over.

29:22.694 --> 29:25.925
- l thought this was over.
- Apparently not.

29:25.997 --> 29:29.694
You have a good thing going, you can bet
somebody will try and take it away.

29:29.934 --> 29:33.131
l'm beginning to understand
why a man becomes a conservative.

29:33.204 --> 29:35.468
He's got something to conserve.

29:39.811 --> 29:43.144
- Are you all right, Jack?
- l didn't get much sleep last night.

29:43.214 --> 29:45.512
- Of course you didn't.
- l'll be fine.

29:51.990 --> 29:55.448
Gail, push my osteoplasty back half an hour.

29:55.527 --> 29:56.516
Yes, doctor.

29:56.594 --> 29:58.960
l'm taking your chem peel.
You're going home.

29:59.030 --> 30:03.160
- l said l'll be fine.
- Take a look at yourself.

30:04.836 --> 30:06.770
You look like hell, Jack.

30:06.838 --> 30:09.500
Look, l appreciate the offer.

30:09.574 --> 30:14.477
Don't get me wrong.
l am not being magnanimous here.

30:14.546 --> 30:18.141
We just can't afford
to make any more mistakes right now.

30:24.155 --> 30:25.417
Yes, thank you.

30:26.191 --> 30:28.557
Dr Franklin's left, but his office confirms

30:28.626 --> 30:31.754
one of his patient's birthdays
corresponds with one of the sabbaths.

30:31.830 --> 30:35.095
- When is that patient scheduled?
- She's already in pre-op

30:35.166 --> 30:37.726
and one of the other doctors is filling in.

30:41.072 --> 30:43.063
ls Dr Franklin OK?

30:44.108 --> 30:46.633
He's just not feeling very well.

30:48.279 --> 30:51.373
l suppose this is one of those procedures

30:51.449 --> 30:57.183
- that all doctors here can do, isn't it?
- Yes.

30:58.122 --> 31:00.147
Yes, Dr Franklin said

31:00.225 --> 31:03.888
that a chemical skin peel is safe,

31:04.762 --> 31:07.356
almost... risk-free.

31:20.178 --> 31:22.146
We're looking for Dr Shannon.

31:48.273 --> 31:53.404
Our practice has been affiliated
with Greenwood for 13 years.

31:53.478 --> 31:57.972
Now the ASU accounts for over 50Âº/o
of this hospital's revenue.

31:59.817 --> 32:02.047
Do you understand what that means?

32:02.120 --> 32:05.283
That doctors in other fields
have seen their earnings fall

32:05.356 --> 32:08.621
because of managed health care,
and you've all become wealthy.

32:08.693 --> 32:11.856
We fill a need. We didn't create it.

32:15.266 --> 32:17.257
Everyone wants to be beautiful.

32:19.737 --> 32:22.604
But our success made us arrogant.

32:22.674 --> 32:26.474
l'm willing to accept responsibility
for certain of our... mistakes.

32:26.544 --> 32:29.877
Mistakes? Like those patient deaths
ten years ago?

32:33.217 --> 32:38.655
That any of us could be capable of such
gross negligence was inconceivable.

32:38.723 --> 32:43.683
- So you covered it up.
- lf we did, it was with the hospital's blessing.

32:45.096 --> 32:47.121
They conducted the investigation.

32:50.034 --> 32:52.969
We had become too valuable an asset,

32:53.037 --> 32:57.337
something they had to protect,
even at the cost of five lives.

32:58.843 --> 33:02.244
- There were five deaths?
- Yes, four patients.

33:03.047 --> 33:08.212
The fifth was a colleague of ours who,
for all intents and purposes,

33:08.286 --> 33:11.687
worked himself to death.
He died of a drug overdose.

33:11.756 --> 33:16.159
- What was his name?
- Dr Cox. Clifford Cox.

33:16.227 --> 33:18.525
- Do you have a file on him?
- ln the computer.

33:18.596 --> 33:21.793
l'll need that and the files
on the deaths ten years ago.

33:21.866 --> 33:24.061
Why? What are you thinking?

33:26.104 --> 33:29.232
Dr Clifford Cox. Birthday: July 7, 1939.

33:29.307 --> 33:33.505
Can you take that photo and run it through
the cosmetic-surgery program l saw?

33:33.578 --> 33:37.036
lt will take me a few seconds
to load up the software.

33:39.150 --> 33:42.085
l'm still not sure where you're going with this.

33:42.153 --> 33:44.314
Ten years ago, four patients died.

33:44.389 --> 33:49.725
Like recent victims, their birth dates matched
the witches' sabbaths, except Dr Cox.

33:49.794 --> 33:54.424
But Cox was a doctor. Nothing about his
death matches up except its coincidence.

33:54.499 --> 33:56.490
Maybe, maybe not.

33:56.868 --> 33:58.301
l'm online here.

34:06.244 --> 34:10.647
This software gives patients
an idea of their projected result, right?

34:10.715 --> 34:15.344
Within the limits of what the patient comes
in with, we approach that aesthetic ideal.

34:15.420 --> 34:18.981
The program is based upon
a matrix of relative proportions.

34:19.056 --> 34:20.786
Vanity.

34:22.126 --> 34:24.458
Vanity, all is vanity.

34:26.630 --> 34:27.460
Here it is.

34:29.199 --> 34:32.931
Can you move the eyes further apart
and strengthen the forehead?

34:33.004 --> 34:37.168
- That's beyond our surgical capabilities.
- l know.

34:43.281 --> 34:45.215
l don't understand.

34:47.251 --> 34:48.775
lt looks like Jack Franklin.

35:36.467 --> 35:39.163
- Where else could he be?
- l don't know.

35:39.237 --> 35:42.001
l'll check the OR. Maybe he's there.

35:42.707 --> 35:45.232
- He's not answering his pages.
- Did you try his home?

35:45.309 --> 35:47.300
Answering machine.

35:47.378 --> 35:52.042
Are you thinking Dr Cox murdered these
patients and then became Dr Franklin?

35:52.116 --> 35:55.916
l think he murdered those patients
so he could become Dr Franklin.

35:55.987 --> 35:58.615
This transformation is medically impossible.

35:58.689 --> 36:01.556
lt's not medicine, Scully. lt's blood sacrifice.

36:01.626 --> 36:04.026
- Blood sacrifice?
- The most potent offering in black magic.

36:04.095 --> 36:06.859
What if, having reached
the limits of medical miracles,

36:06.931 --> 36:08.865
he decided to stage a miracle of his own?

36:08.933 --> 36:12.960
So he committed these murders
in order to make himself beautiful?

36:13.037 --> 36:15.597
Everybody wants to be beautiful, Scully.

37:02.253 --> 37:03.584
Jack!

37:06.424 --> 37:08.551
What are you doing?

37:08.626 --> 37:10.958
l'm so glad that you're here.

37:14.031 --> 37:16.499
Jack, stay right where you are.

37:30.448 --> 37:35.044
l hope those instruments
were properly sterilized.

37:46.464 --> 37:48.659
Dr Franklin?

38:11.789 --> 38:13.780
Scully, come over here.

38:21.399 --> 38:25.062
Stop right there.
Look what you're standing on.

38:27.772 --> 38:29.763
This one's different.

38:31.042 --> 38:33.033
lt's been inverted.

38:34.011 --> 38:36.605
See these two upright points here?

38:36.681 --> 38:41.175
They represent the goat of lust,
attacking heaven with its horns.

38:41.252 --> 38:45.518
He's inscribed all the names
of the patients who were killed.

38:48.125 --> 38:50.150
lncluding Dr Shannon.

38:53.030 --> 38:55.362
Clear the way! Moving through!

38:56.367 --> 38:58.358
What did you swallow?

38:58.969 --> 39:01.767
- What did you swallow?
- She didn't say.

39:01.839 --> 39:04.501
l'm going in
to do an exploratory laparotomy.

39:06.344 --> 39:08.244
Please... don't.

39:09.213 --> 39:12.979
Give her two units blood, stat. Someone
get a 16-gauge lV in and open it wide.

39:13.050 --> 39:15.041
l'll get the lV, doctor.

39:17.254 --> 39:19.722
No. Please, no.

39:21.625 --> 39:24.560
No. No, please, don't.

39:43.447 --> 39:48.111
Where's Dr Shannon? They said
she was brought here in an emergency.

39:53.958 --> 39:55.289
Mulder, here.

39:59.463 --> 40:02.591
Don't let them operate.
Hold them off until you hear from me.

40:02.666 --> 40:05.362
- Where are you going?
- To find Dr Franklin.

40:30.861 --> 40:32.795
- More snaps.
- Here you go.

40:32.863 --> 40:34.194
Sponge it.

40:34.432 --> 40:36.400
- Suction.
- Suction.

40:39.170 --> 40:41.104
- Flush.
- Saline.

40:41.172 --> 40:43.436
- More sponge.
- Lap.

40:44.241 --> 40:47.540
- You have to stop this procedure!
- Whoever that person is, get her out now!

40:47.611 --> 40:50.079
l'm Special Agent Dana Scully, FBl.

40:50.147 --> 40:53.116
- Get out of here now!
- Listen to me! l'm a doctor!

40:54.385 --> 40:56.945
- What the hell's going on?
- l'm a federal agent.

40:57.021 --> 41:00.115
l don't care who you are.
You can't interrupt a surgery.

41:00.191 --> 41:03.627
- This woman could die.
- That's what l'm trying to prevent.

41:47.505 --> 41:50.702
- What happened?
- They saved her life.

41:51.175 --> 41:56.408
They just pulled a whole rack of surgical
instruments out of her intestinal tract.

41:56.480 --> 41:58.471
God knows how they got there.

41:59.984 --> 42:01.110
Then it failed.

42:01.185 --> 42:03.346
Code blue team to the ER, stat.

42:13.797 --> 42:16.698
l tried to stop him! He just went crazy!

42:16.767 --> 42:18.758
We're losing her! Fast!

42:18.836 --> 42:21.168
What is this patient's birth date?

42:26.076 --> 42:28.067
October 31st.

42:28.879 --> 42:32.906
- Halloween.
- And Samhain, the fourth witches' sabbath.

42:50.000 --> 42:51.763
l can't tell you how happy we are

42:51.835 --> 42:54.895
that you've decided to join us, Dr Hartman.

42:54.972 --> 42:57.964
Well, l like what l've seen so far.

42:58.876 --> 43:02.039
The truth is,
l've always been drawn to Los Angeles.

43:02.112 --> 43:05.707
With your credentials,
l'm sure you had plenty of options.

43:07.318 --> 43:10.879
l've been reviewing your patient portfolio.

43:10.955 --> 43:14.686
Your work is among
the most impressive l've ever seen.

43:15.059 --> 43:19.792
l like to say whoever God didn't get around
to creating in his own image,

43:19.863 --> 43:22.195
it's ourjob to recreate in ours.
