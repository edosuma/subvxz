00:03.875 --> 00:06.542
(ominous music)

00:46.816 --> 00:48.933
- [Woman] If you go back
far enough I reckon everyone

00:48.933 --> 00:50.491
must be related to a witch.

00:50.491 --> 00:52.891
- Don't call her a witch.

00:52.891 --> 00:54.627
- Why not, everyone else does.

00:54.627 --> 00:58.504
- In any case, witches were
just poor demented women

00:58.504 --> 01:00.240
that got persecuted.

01:00.240 --> 01:01.162
- You think.

01:01.162 --> 01:02.162
- Of course.

01:03.444 --> 01:07.277
It's not like they could
actually do anything.

01:08.782 --> 01:11.704
- You don't believe in spells then?

01:11.704 --> 01:13.037
- Of course not.

01:15.961 --> 01:20.044
- So, it wouldn't bother
you if I was to do this?

01:23.608 --> 01:27.376
- Stop it.
(cat meowing)

01:27.376 --> 01:28.709
That's horrible.

01:29.824 --> 01:31.672
- Cassie please that's not funny.

01:31.672 --> 01:34.325
- It can't hurt it, can
it, it's not real, is it.

01:34.325 --> 01:35.992
- Stop it!
- Cassie!

01:38.703 --> 01:42.870
(car horn honking)
(blood splattering)

02:28.969 --> 02:31.386
(rock music)

02:36.519 --> 02:38.019
Have you seen Esther?

02:38.019 --> 02:41.102
- Christ, Lindsey, nearly died there.

02:42.534 --> 02:45.169
- Oh sorry, have you though?

02:45.169 --> 02:48.163
- Have we what?
- Seen Esther?

02:48.163 --> 02:51.588
- Hello Esther, did Lindsey
leave the door open again?

02:51.588 --> 02:53.142
- Come on I'd better take
you back, they'll be worried

02:53.142 --> 02:54.326
about you.

02:54.326 --> 02:58.185
- Nevermind, she can't
have gone far, bless her.

02:58.185 --> 03:00.400
- You shouldn't be on your own
you know, there's no telling

03:00.400 --> 03:04.567
what might happen to a
girl on her own after dark.

03:06.016 --> 03:06.849
No thanks.

03:06.849 --> 03:09.516
(ominous music)

03:12.667 --> 03:16.870
- Do you want us to help?
- No, no, no, we'll find her.

03:16.870 --> 03:21.037
She's a sweetie really,
just a little bit confused.

03:22.363 --> 03:25.280
(frolicking music)

03:28.682 --> 03:30.671
- Are you sure you don't want us to help.

03:30.671 --> 03:32.195
- She's sure.

03:32.195 --> 03:35.218
- Don't worry, don't worry we'll find her.

03:35.218 --> 03:37.661
It's the third time this
week, we ought to have

03:37.661 --> 03:39.925
a tracking device set into her nighty.

03:39.925 --> 03:41.288
- Yeah...

03:41.288 --> 03:43.871
- It's okay, she's here.
- Ah...

03:44.769 --> 03:47.352
Esther whatever were you doing?

03:50.959 --> 03:53.292
What are you doing in there?

04:00.862 --> 04:03.112
(groaning)

04:06.391 --> 04:09.891
- I can't do this, I can't we're not kids.

04:10.973 --> 04:14.390
We should have a place of our own by now.

04:16.144 --> 04:18.059
- We could go back to mine.

04:18.059 --> 04:22.226
(giggling)
(anticipatory music)

04:29.264 --> 04:30.431
- [Amy] Sorry.

04:34.842 --> 04:37.509
- I thought I heard you come in.

04:38.673 --> 04:40.233
- I thought you said you were going out.

04:40.233 --> 04:42.215
- We decided not to
bother, your dad's got one

04:42.215 --> 04:46.382
of his tummies.
- (laughing) Right.

04:49.089 --> 04:50.502
- See you in the morning then.

04:50.502 --> 04:53.889
- Yeah night, Mom.
- Night, night Amy.

04:53.889 --> 04:55.389
Night, night Ryan.

05:00.830 --> 05:03.287
(laughing)

05:03.287 --> 05:04.120
- Ah shit.

05:08.894 --> 05:09.769
- [Mother] I keep telling him it's all

05:09.769 --> 05:11.852
the brownies he's eating.

05:13.938 --> 05:16.244
- Mom, about last night.

05:16.244 --> 05:20.411
- It can't be any good for
him but he won't listen.

05:22.180 --> 05:23.013
- Mom.

05:24.614 --> 05:26.531
Mom, I was wondering...

05:28.202 --> 05:32.343
When I'm in my room,
do you think you could?

05:32.343 --> 05:34.194
Do you mind knocking,

05:34.194 --> 05:36.293
I'm not trying to be funny or anything.

05:36.293 --> 05:38.732
- Here he is now, Amy
and I were just saying

05:38.732 --> 05:40.909
you'd be much better off
with a proper breakfast.

05:40.909 --> 05:43.326
- This is a proper breakfast.

05:44.610 --> 05:47.223
- Mom, I was trying to say--

05:47.223 --> 05:51.751
- You'd never guess this
was non-stick, would you?

05:51.751 --> 05:54.418
- Or we can talk about it later.

05:57.865 --> 05:59.041
- See ya later love.

05:59.041 --> 06:01.458
(rock music)

06:30.929 --> 06:32.786
- Morning, all right?
- Good morning.

06:32.786 --> 06:34.018
Yeah that looks great.

06:34.018 --> 06:36.073
- It does, isn't it?
- Yeah.

06:36.073 --> 06:38.156
- See you later.
- See ya.

06:44.930 --> 06:47.281
Morning Simon.
- Oh morning Amy.

06:47.281 --> 06:49.915
Hah, PC Summers, if you don't mind.

06:49.915 --> 06:51.279
- Sorry.
- I'm on duty now.

06:51.279 --> 06:52.512
In my official capacity as

06:52.512 --> 06:54.621
a police community support officer.

06:54.621 --> 06:55.922
- Right.
- I know some people

06:55.922 --> 06:57.784
might find it petty, but,
I believe it's important

06:57.784 --> 07:01.951
to maintain the dignity of the
police service, at all times.

07:02.827 --> 07:04.910
- Of course, sorry Simon.

07:06.456 --> 07:09.419
♫ In the kingdom of fairies and dragons

07:09.419 --> 07:11.811

07:11.811 --> 07:14.324
♫ There was a light princess
and an evil dark lord

07:14.324 --> 07:17.198

(humming)

07:36.894 --> 07:38.227
- Sorry!
- Sorry.

07:39.106 --> 07:40.331
- Are you all right?

07:40.331 --> 07:41.164
- Yeah.

07:44.807 --> 07:45.890
No I'm not...

07:47.205 --> 07:48.438
- What's happened?

07:48.438 --> 07:52.235
- It's Nathan, he stood me up last night,

07:52.235 --> 07:55.096
I thought he loved me.
- Nathan?

07:55.096 --> 07:57.338
He wouldn't do that.

07:57.338 --> 08:00.754
- He was supposed to be at
the pub after work last night,

08:00.754 --> 08:03.909
then we had to look for Esther,
and I forgot to text him

08:03.909 --> 08:05.512
to say I'd be late.

08:05.512 --> 08:08.610
- And he didn't show, have you called him?

08:08.610 --> 08:10.413
- I'm trying but he's not answering,

08:10.413 --> 08:13.329
I've left messages but nothing.

08:13.329 --> 08:17.751
- That's weird, maybe
he's had his phone nicked.

08:17.751 --> 08:19.161
- You think?

08:19.161 --> 08:21.197
- Don't worry he'll turn up.

08:21.197 --> 08:24.075
If I see I'll ask him to call you.

08:24.075 --> 08:24.908
- Okay...

08:29.198 --> 08:32.765
(elevator music)

08:32.765 --> 08:36.549
- I'm not implying
anything, it just seems like

08:36.549 --> 08:38.370
an awful lot of products.

08:38.370 --> 08:40.080
- Well maybe that's
because I've been dealing

08:40.080 --> 08:42.496
with an awful lot of clients.

08:43.477 --> 08:46.281
- Really, only the incoming
for this quarter doesn't

08:46.281 --> 08:48.544
seem to have gone up at all.

08:48.544 --> 08:51.426
- Well that's probably because
you've had to cut your prices

08:51.426 --> 08:54.182
so low to get anyone in here at all.

08:54.182 --> 08:56.099
- Why is that I wonder?

08:56.099 --> 08:58.491
If the customers were
happy with the service,

08:58.491 --> 09:00.734
if they walked out that
door feeling pampered

09:00.734 --> 09:03.002
and beautiful, with gorgeous hair,

09:03.002 --> 09:04.860
I wouldn't have to rely on special offers

09:04.860 --> 09:06.464
to drag them in, would I?

09:06.464 --> 09:08.936
- So you're saying there's
something wrong with my cutting?

09:08.936 --> 09:11.865
- Well would you want to face the world

09:11.865 --> 09:14.913
with a bob like that?
- It's the way she likes it!

09:14.913 --> 09:16.996
(scoffs)

09:19.251 --> 09:20.751
- And what's this?

09:24.159 --> 09:26.492
- What it says, kennel fees.

09:28.077 --> 09:31.390
It was my week off remember,
I was supposed to be on

09:31.390 --> 09:34.354
holiday until you begged me to come in.

09:34.354 --> 09:36.373
- It was an emergency.

09:36.373 --> 09:38.308
- Oh only so you could go on a freebie

09:38.308 --> 09:40.488
on one of your council trips.

09:40.488 --> 09:43.700
- This has nothing to do
with my work as a councilor.

09:43.700 --> 09:46.587
I'm asking why you have put down 68 pounds

09:46.587 --> 09:48.101
for kennel fees.

09:48.101 --> 09:51.270
- Because I agreed to
look after my sister's cat

09:51.270 --> 09:54.146
during my holiday, what
was I supposed to do,

09:54.146 --> 09:57.373
leave it to fend for itself.
- It's a bloody cat!

09:57.373 --> 09:59.727
That's what they do!

09:59.727 --> 10:02.358
- Right, that's it, I'm leaving,

10:02.358 --> 10:05.095
I've put up with your
crap for long enough.

10:05.095 --> 10:07.853
It's your bloody salon,
you cut the bloody hair!

10:07.853 --> 10:08.686
- Fuck!

10:10.085 --> 10:11.502
Fuck, fuck, fuck!

10:15.075 --> 10:17.627
Where's the appointments book?

10:17.627 --> 10:20.627
- Here.
- I don't have time for this.

10:23.292 --> 10:25.241
I'll put out an emergency call,

10:25.241 --> 10:27.712
there must be a stylist somewhere.

10:27.712 --> 10:29.626
- I have finished my training now--

10:29.626 --> 10:33.220
- The next one is due at 10:15,
you'd better start phoning.

10:33.220 --> 10:34.993
There's a couple of kids due in later.

10:34.993 --> 10:36.942
I'm sure you could cope with them.

10:36.942 --> 10:38.275
- What about me?

10:51.668 --> 10:55.335
- Come back tomorrow,
until then, try a hat.

10:58.458 --> 11:00.625

11:07.286 --> 11:09.869

11:30.109 --> 11:34.867
♫ She's going out with birthdays

11:34.867 --> 11:39.034
♫ I wanna be with you
night and day, so swag

11:40.505 --> 11:44.088
(singing incomprehensibly)

11:51.120 --> 11:52.991
- Don't you ever shut up?

11:52.991 --> 11:54.908
- Music is my life man.

11:57.287 --> 11:59.954
- They sound better than you do.

12:00.844 --> 12:05.591
♫ I, I want you tonight,
want you tonight, come on

12:05.591 --> 12:06.841
- Jesus.
- Yeah!

12:07.875 --> 12:09.458
Enjoy, guitar solo!

12:21.066 --> 12:23.715
- I'm starving, I haven't
stopped all morning.

12:23.715 --> 12:27.088
- Really, lucky you, I've done bugger all.

12:27.088 --> 12:27.921
- Oh?

12:31.557 --> 12:33.550
- He's had me trailing around behind him,

12:33.550 --> 12:35.555
putting up for sale signs.

12:35.555 --> 12:37.410
- I guess someone's gotta do it.

12:37.410 --> 12:39.721
- Yeah but why me?

12:39.721 --> 12:40.792
- Maybe he likes to keep you close

12:40.792 --> 12:42.772
so he can teach you things.

12:42.772 --> 12:45.036
- Amy I still haven't found him.

12:45.036 --> 12:46.660
There's something wrong there
must be, he wouldn't worry

12:46.660 --> 12:49.115
me like this.
- What is it now?

12:49.115 --> 12:52.976
- It's Nathan, he's vanished,
I can't find him anywhere.

12:52.976 --> 12:55.483
- He's probably avoiding you.

12:55.483 --> 12:56.600
- He can't have just disappeared.

12:56.600 --> 12:58.251
- Well where could he be then?

12:58.251 --> 12:59.563
- Well it's obvious,
he hasn't got the guts

12:59.563 --> 13:01.455
to dump you to your face.

13:01.455 --> 13:02.446
- Ryan!

13:02.446 --> 13:05.006
- Oh I'm just saying.
- Well don't.

13:05.006 --> 13:07.594
- Nathan is not like
that, he's kind and sweet.

13:07.594 --> 13:09.458
- Oh yeah, check your texts.

13:09.458 --> 13:10.953
- Zip it Ryan she's worried.

13:10.953 --> 13:13.888
Sorry Lindsey he doesn't
mean to be a prat.

13:13.888 --> 13:15.163
- What?

13:15.163 --> 13:16.517
- It's okay Amy I forgive him,

13:16.517 --> 13:18.850
I know he can't help anyway.

13:20.207 --> 13:23.223
Dillon, have you see Nathan,
has he been on the beach?

13:23.223 --> 13:25.120
- Nah, he's probably
gone over to East Point,

13:25.120 --> 13:27.618
they've got some massive surf over there.

13:27.618 --> 13:30.501
- I don't understand he always
lets me know where he is.

13:30.501 --> 13:31.555
I should be very disappointed if he's--

13:31.555 --> 13:34.555
- Check your texts it will be there.

13:41.532 --> 13:43.377
- You guys making Scareycrows this year?

13:43.377 --> 13:45.088
- You seem to be forgetting
Dillon the rest of us

13:45.088 --> 13:46.433
grew up years ago.

13:46.433 --> 13:47.717
- I'm supposed to be
doing one for the salon,

13:47.717 --> 13:50.033
for the winter display.

13:50.033 --> 13:51.661
- I used to love making Scareycrows.

13:51.661 --> 13:53.603
- Then make one, there's no rule that says

13:53.603 --> 13:55.038
it's only for kids.

13:55.038 --> 13:56.979
- I just hope it goes
better than last year.

13:56.979 --> 14:00.775
- Ah, me too, oh my God, all
I remember about last year

14:00.775 --> 14:02.821
was getting bundled into an
ambulance until my appendix

14:02.821 --> 14:05.834
had burst, look I thought I was dying.

14:05.834 --> 14:07.783
- You missed out on all the action.

14:07.783 --> 14:10.963
Ryan doing his hero act and
dragging Cassie of the sea.

14:10.963 --> 14:13.186
I still say she was lucky he was there,

14:13.186 --> 14:15.783
most people I know
would've left her to drown.

14:15.783 --> 14:17.928
- Dillon, that's a terrible thing to say.

14:17.928 --> 14:21.778
- What it's true, she's
a bitch, she always was.

14:21.778 --> 14:25.150
- Even so, you shouldn't
be horrible about her.

14:25.150 --> 14:28.907
It's like, well, speaking ill of the dead.

14:28.907 --> 14:30.686
- She's not dead, she's
just in a wheelchair.

14:30.686 --> 14:32.246
- It's a bit more than that.

14:32.246 --> 14:34.240
- Have any of you actually seen her?

14:34.240 --> 14:35.557
Since the accident I mean.

14:35.557 --> 14:36.755
- Well didn't you know she's back.

14:36.755 --> 14:38.532
- Really?
- Hmm-mm.

14:38.532 --> 14:40.140
- I was kind of hoping
we'd never see her again.

14:40.140 --> 14:41.463
- Well her dad's got her.

14:41.463 --> 14:43.368
- Hmm, that's all we need.

14:43.368 --> 14:46.118
Cassie causing trouble again.

14:46.118 --> 14:49.642
- I don't think there's
much chance of that.

14:49.642 --> 14:52.142
(eerie music)

15:23.203 --> 15:24.978
- What?
- ID please.

15:24.978 --> 15:26.728
- So who the fuck do you think I am then?

15:26.728 --> 15:28.930
- I have no idea mate, no ID, no entry.

15:28.930 --> 15:31.449
If you can't prove your
age, you're not coming in.

15:31.449 --> 15:33.616
- Ah Jesus.
- Please, Sean.

15:34.700 --> 15:36.617
He's your cousin.
- So?

15:38.494 --> 15:40.720
- So you fucking well know I'm over 21.

15:40.720 --> 15:44.356
- Passport, driving license
or photographic ID card.

15:44.356 --> 15:48.051
- Have we got a problem?
- Hey, good to see you mate!

15:48.051 --> 15:49.927
- You all right?
- Hello Steph!

15:49.927 --> 15:50.760
- Hi Ryan.

15:51.618 --> 15:52.451
- We going in?

15:52.451 --> 15:54.415
- Not without IDs you're not.

15:54.415 --> 15:57.248
- Oh God, nothing changes does it?

16:02.810 --> 16:03.643
Happy now?

16:05.451 --> 16:06.284
Come on.

16:18.123 --> 16:19.841
- I'll pay you back mate
I'm just a bit short.

16:19.841 --> 16:22.727
- That's all right, forget
about it, it's good to see you.

16:22.727 --> 16:23.927
- So are you back for the summer?

16:23.927 --> 16:26.024
- Oh God no, I'm doing
a placement in Paris

16:26.024 --> 16:28.466
with an aeronautics company
for a couple of months,

16:28.466 --> 16:31.023
and then I'll be back at uni in October,

16:31.023 --> 16:32.868
so I thought I'd better
pop down and see the family

16:32.868 --> 16:34.652
before I head off, you know.

16:34.652 --> 16:36.094
So watch about you?

16:36.094 --> 16:37.558
- You're were working
in that grotty little

16:37.558 --> 16:40.145
estate agents the last time we came back,

16:40.145 --> 16:42.578
what are you up to now.

16:42.578 --> 16:43.411
- Well--

16:43.411 --> 16:46.429
- He's still in the grotty
little estate agents,

16:46.429 --> 16:48.737
doing very well there, actually.

16:48.737 --> 16:50.685
- That's great, it's always
busy in the property market

16:50.685 --> 16:52.102
isn't it?
- Yeah.

16:54.159 --> 16:56.549
- Oh I'll be with you in a minute.

16:56.549 --> 17:00.065
- And how about you Amy, what
keeps you busy with your days?

17:00.065 --> 17:02.125
- Still in hair and beauty,
I could make the most

17:02.125 --> 17:04.458
ordinary girl look stunning.

17:06.133 --> 17:08.012
You should call in sometime.

17:08.012 --> 17:10.531
- I'd love to, but my
aunt's got me a place

17:10.531 --> 17:13.540
in a short history of art
course at the Sorbonne.

17:13.540 --> 17:15.255
So I'll be flying out with Alex.

17:15.255 --> 17:16.827
- You won't be here for long then.

17:16.827 --> 17:19.982
- Afraid not.
- Right, what can I get you?

17:19.982 --> 17:22.871
- Cranberry vodka.
- Pint of cider.

17:22.871 --> 17:24.646
- I'll have a pint of (mumbling).

17:24.646 --> 17:25.993
- And I'll have a lager please.

17:25.993 --> 17:27.875
- Okay, (muttering), yes.

17:27.875 --> 17:29.366
- And how's life with your Josh?

17:29.366 --> 17:30.888
- Good thanks.
- Still working hard?

17:30.888 --> 17:32.081
- He never stops.

17:32.081 --> 17:33.461
- I have to raise money somehow.

17:33.461 --> 17:35.484
- For what?
- Equipment!

17:35.484 --> 17:38.742
Amplifiers, speakers, lighting.

17:38.742 --> 17:40.095
- Really, what for?

17:40.095 --> 17:41.743
- Oh to launch myself, I was gonna go on

17:41.743 --> 17:43.864
Britain's Got Talent, but
I've lost faith in them now,

17:43.864 --> 17:46.695
so, I've decided to self-promote,
I've got the website,

17:46.695 --> 17:48.704
YouTube channel, all I
need now is recordings

17:48.704 --> 17:50.449
from a few gigs, so I can
start selling my music

17:50.449 --> 17:52.593
direct to the public.

17:52.593 --> 17:57.024
- That's impressive, how have
the gigs been going then?

17:57.024 --> 18:00.549
- Well I haven't actually had any yet.

18:00.549 --> 18:02.258
But I do have my first
booking lined up though.

18:02.258 --> 18:04.142
- Really?
- Yeah, come if you like!

18:04.142 --> 18:07.071
- We'd love to but, we're
only back for a few nights.

18:07.071 --> 18:08.213
- Well that's okay, it's tomorrow.

18:08.213 --> 18:09.497
- Great, where are you playing?

18:09.497 --> 18:11.282
- On the lawn, I'm the
official entertainment

18:11.282 --> 18:13.032
for Scareycrow Night.

18:16.166 --> 18:19.345
- Oh dear God.
- Brilliant, we'll be there.

18:19.345 --> 18:20.178
- Cool.

18:22.097 --> 18:24.764
- Oh look it's Jules and Marvin.

18:26.553 --> 18:28.931
- Oh right, we'll see you then.

18:28.931 --> 18:31.848
Bring it to the table Josh.
- Cool!

18:34.569 --> 18:37.402
- Pretentious stuck-up little cow.

18:39.315 --> 18:41.206
- Why does he get to work
in Paris for the summer

18:41.206 --> 18:43.762
when I'm stuck in this dump?

18:43.762 --> 18:47.188
- Because his father owns
a construction company

18:47.188 --> 18:48.688
and yours doesn't.

18:55.050 --> 18:58.036
- I bet they don't have to
creep around the park benches.

18:58.036 --> 18:58.869
- No...

19:03.076 --> 19:05.816
- It's all about opportunity
thought isn't it,

19:05.816 --> 19:08.079
he's had 'em all of his life.

19:08.079 --> 19:10.055
- Here guys.
- Thanks.

19:10.055 --> 19:11.222
- Cheers mate.

19:12.948 --> 19:15.994
I'm never gonna get any though, am I?

19:15.994 --> 19:18.260
Not unless I go out
and find it for myself.

19:18.260 --> 19:19.760
- How do you mean?

19:21.478 --> 19:24.893
- I can do so much more with my life Amy.

19:24.893 --> 19:25.976
I know I can.

19:27.279 --> 19:28.757
Do you know how I spent this afternoon?

19:28.757 --> 19:29.826
- No.

19:29.826 --> 19:32.019
- Dusting a house.

19:32.019 --> 19:34.552
I'm not joking, some old
lady dies and she's got this

19:34.552 --> 19:37.609
cottage as a holiday let,
so he had me over there

19:37.609 --> 19:40.526
all afternoon tidying it up.
- Hmmm.

19:43.264 --> 19:44.431
- Shit.
- What?

19:45.439 --> 19:49.198
- Oh, I've gotta bring the key back.

19:49.198 --> 19:50.031
- Will you get in trouble?

19:50.031 --> 19:52.136
- Only if he finds out.

19:52.136 --> 19:53.786
- You said it's empty?

19:53.786 --> 19:56.036
(laughing)

19:58.078 --> 20:00.745
(ominous music)

20:08.091 --> 20:08.924
- You!

20:17.123 --> 20:18.912
- I still don't see how
he can just sack you.

20:18.912 --> 20:21.257
- Really, because he just did.

20:21.257 --> 20:23.190
- Yeah but you could've apologized.

20:23.190 --> 20:24.180
- No.
- Oh sure.

20:24.180 --> 20:25.993
- No, I don't like begging.

20:25.993 --> 20:26.826
- But you--

20:26.826 --> 20:28.247
- And do you know why because
I don't want his crappy

20:28.247 --> 20:29.164
little job.

20:30.330 --> 20:31.921
I haven't meant it to happen like this

20:31.921 --> 20:34.400
but how would you feel about

20:34.400 --> 20:36.621
moving to London?

20:36.621 --> 20:37.823
- What?

20:37.823 --> 20:39.170
- I know it's a bit sudden, but sometimes

20:39.170 --> 20:42.044
you have to take an
opportunity when it comes.

20:42.044 --> 20:43.627
- What opportunity?

20:44.884 --> 20:46.784
- If this hadn't have happened,
we might have gone on for

20:46.784 --> 20:50.324
years, never daring to make the break.

20:50.324 --> 20:51.482
- What are you on about?

20:51.482 --> 20:53.046
- It's what we want isn't it?

20:53.046 --> 20:56.134
A real life somewhere with prospects.

20:56.134 --> 21:00.017
- I'm not going anywhere, I've
still got a job, remember.

21:00.017 --> 21:02.036
- I thought you loved me.

21:02.036 --> 21:05.826
- I do, well I'm not just
gonna throw everything out

21:05.826 --> 21:07.243
and go to London.

21:08.336 --> 21:11.217
- What so what, you're saying we're over?

21:11.217 --> 21:14.930
- No, you're the one who's
talking about leaving not me.

21:14.930 --> 21:17.682
- But if you won't come with
me then it's the same thing.

21:17.682 --> 21:19.496
- Jesus Ryan you're unbelievable.

21:19.496 --> 21:21.726
- Make your mind up Amy!
Are you coming or not?

21:21.726 --> 21:23.976
(groaning)

21:36.674 --> 21:39.257
(upbeat music)

21:52.655 --> 21:54.667
- Where is it?
- Pardon?

21:54.667 --> 21:57.173
- The Scareycrow you were
supposed to have done

21:57.173 --> 21:58.292
the window display.

21:58.292 --> 21:59.690
- I'm sorry I was on my own.

21:59.690 --> 22:02.406
- And, Christ Almighty.

22:02.406 --> 22:03.239
- I'm sorry.

22:03.239 --> 22:06.081
- You do realize that
I am supposed to show

22:06.081 --> 22:09.912
the judges around all
the Scareycrow displays?

22:09.912 --> 22:13.698
What the hell are they going
to think if my own salon

22:13.698 --> 22:16.832
doesn't even have a Scareycrow, hmm?

22:16.832 --> 22:17.683
- I did try.

22:17.683 --> 22:21.850
- Not hard enough, I want
that window done by lunchtime

22:24.824 --> 22:27.741
and it had better look spectacular.

22:29.566 --> 22:32.669
Now where the hell is this stylist?

22:32.669 --> 22:36.836
Oh Jesus, why do I always
have to deal with idiots hmm?

22:39.637 --> 22:43.828
Just for once, for once, why
can't they send me someone

22:43.828 --> 22:46.798
efficient and professional.

22:46.798 --> 22:50.965
- Someone hardworking, talented
and stunningly creative?

22:52.815 --> 22:55.482
Your prayers have been answered.

23:00.485 --> 23:03.568
Hmm, shabby chic meets rural neglect.

23:05.125 --> 23:06.042
Very 1970s.

23:07.532 --> 23:10.544
- Are you?
- Yes, Declan Villers,

23:10.544 --> 23:13.754
formerly of Cuts 'n
Quiffs on the King's Road.

23:13.754 --> 23:15.687
Of course that was before
I went into exile in

23:15.687 --> 23:17.126
the provinces.

23:17.126 --> 23:19.543
- Right, well, I'm Donna Bex.

23:23.609 --> 23:26.125
- And this must be Cinderella?

23:26.125 --> 23:28.625
- It's Amy the junior stylist.

23:29.604 --> 23:33.489
- Excellent, I always
like to have a slave.

23:33.489 --> 23:35.406
Now show me the basics.

23:41.241 --> 23:42.074
- Ahem.

23:43.429 --> 23:44.752
- Can I help you, madam?

23:44.752 --> 23:45.752
- I hope so.

23:47.106 --> 23:49.177
- There was a bit of a
problem with her cut.

23:49.177 --> 23:52.010
- They told me to come back today.

23:56.721 --> 23:59.054
- Oh my God that's terminal.

24:01.118 --> 24:02.974
I'm sorry sweetie, but
this is an emergency.

24:02.974 --> 24:05.557
- But you've only just started.

24:12.217 --> 24:14.884
- Was it a punishment?
- A what?

24:21.980 --> 24:25.494
- It's okay, I think we
can salvage something.

24:25.494 --> 24:29.661
I know a place that does an
excellent range of wigs, joking.

24:30.664 --> 24:32.983
Don't worry, we'll have you
fixed to face the world again

24:32.983 --> 24:33.900
in no time.

24:40.336 --> 24:41.579
- Would you like a cup of tea?

24:41.579 --> 24:43.397
- I'd rather have my hair cut.

24:43.397 --> 24:45.325
- Well I would do it
but Donna will kill me

24:45.325 --> 24:49.408
if this isn't finished by
the time she gets back.

25:00.790 --> 25:02.348
Why did you leave London?

25:02.348 --> 25:06.608
- Long story, big city, but a small world.

25:06.608 --> 25:09.079
All those millions of
people and wherever I went

25:09.079 --> 25:11.912
I kept bumping into my ex.
- Oh...

25:13.007 --> 25:15.032
- I got quite paranoid in the end.

25:15.032 --> 25:16.649
I even confronted him
once and asked if he was

25:16.649 --> 25:19.363
stalking me.
- And was he?

25:19.363 --> 25:21.554
- No but it got a bit nasty.

25:21.554 --> 25:25.141
That's when I decided I had to
do something, Declan I said,

25:25.141 --> 25:26.912
time for desperate measures.

25:26.912 --> 25:28.861
You've gotta get away for a while.

25:28.861 --> 25:32.061
It doesn't matter where,
just get on a train and go.

25:32.061 --> 25:33.783
- Just like that?

25:33.783 --> 25:38.042
- It's the Irish in me,
always been impulsive.

25:38.042 --> 25:41.490
- Aren't those things
supposed to go in fields?

25:41.490 --> 25:45.288
- You're thinking of scarecrows,
this is a Scareycrow.

25:45.288 --> 25:46.875
- And the difference is?

25:46.875 --> 25:48.873
- Also a long story.

25:48.873 --> 25:51.180
More of legend really.

25:51.180 --> 25:53.930
- Oh go on, I love a good legend.

25:55.660 --> 25:57.691
- Well it all started
hundreds of years ago

25:57.691 --> 25:59.625
when we were at war with the French.

25:59.625 --> 26:02.239
Sidcombe was just a little
fishing village back then.

26:02.239 --> 26:04.763
All the men had been
press-ganged and taken away

26:04.763 --> 26:07.326
to join the navy, that
meant the women and children

26:07.326 --> 26:10.125
were left alone with
no one to protect them,

26:10.125 --> 26:13.402
and one day a French ship approached.

26:13.402 --> 26:15.006
Of course they were
terrified, because they knew

26:15.006 --> 26:17.321
they couldn't defend themselves,
and the French raiders

26:17.321 --> 26:20.123
had been burning villagers
all along the coast.

26:20.123 --> 26:23.417
It was looking bad but one
of the women had an idea.

26:23.417 --> 26:26.478
She told the others to gather
scarecrows from the fields

26:26.478 --> 26:28.824
and stand them up along the key side,

26:28.824 --> 26:32.325
as the French got closer, they
saw the scarecrows lined up

26:32.325 --> 26:35.742
thought they were troops and sailed away.

26:36.699 --> 26:38.199
- Ah that's sweet.

26:39.121 --> 26:42.259
- And every year since then, there's been

26:42.259 --> 26:45.176
a Scareycrow Festival to celebrate.

26:47.433 --> 26:49.016
- Better?
- Oh yes!

26:50.395 --> 26:53.062
Thank you so much.
- My pleasure.

27:01.526 --> 27:02.394
(gasps)

27:02.394 --> 27:05.311
My God those things are everywhere.

27:09.778 --> 27:11.611
What's it doing there?

27:13.821 --> 27:17.821
Oh I can't cope with that
staring at me all day.

27:18.880 --> 27:23.047
- They're personal friends
of mine of course, yes.

27:23.964 --> 27:27.176
Here it is, and look at
that, that's a fine piece

27:27.176 --> 27:30.135
of weaponry wouldn't you say,
a fine piece of weaponry.

27:30.135 --> 27:32.297
- Highly dangerous.

27:32.297 --> 27:35.113
- Well you know, a Scareycrow
is supposed to be dangerous

27:35.113 --> 27:35.946
aren't they?

27:35.946 --> 27:38.279
(muttering)

27:39.894 --> 27:43.996
(groaning)
(laughing)

27:43.996 --> 27:44.996
- Your face!

27:48.240 --> 27:50.715
- What is it with you people,
I thought the stereotype

27:50.715 --> 27:55.537
(mumbling) not trying to
give everyone heart attacks.

27:55.537 --> 28:00.051
- Friendly, Scareycrows
aren't friendly, they're evil.

28:00.051 --> 28:01.992
- Aren't you ever gonna grow up?

28:01.992 --> 28:06.486
- You said I should make a
Scareycrow, what do you think?

28:06.486 --> 28:08.486
- I think you're a twat.

28:09.515 --> 28:11.662
- How can Scareycrows be evil?

28:11.662 --> 28:13.108
I thought they saved the village.

28:13.108 --> 28:17.312
- Oh they did, but I bet you've
only heard the PC version.

28:17.312 --> 28:19.665
- You mean there's a non-PC version?

28:19.665 --> 28:23.163
- Oh yeah, there's the
true version, you know

28:23.163 --> 28:27.581
a long time ago when Sidcombe
was a small fishing village,

28:27.581 --> 28:29.224
it happened once all the
men were press-ganged

28:29.224 --> 28:31.450
into joining the navy, there were a lot of

28:31.450 --> 28:33.052
French raids going on back then.

28:33.052 --> 28:37.219
(guns firing)
(screaming)

28:45.589 --> 28:49.756
But it just happened one
of the women was a witch.

28:51.485 --> 28:53.670
Next thing you know there's
an army of Scareycrows

28:53.670 --> 28:56.543
with pitchforks and scythes
that are slapping the French

28:56.543 --> 29:00.710
into the pieces until the
beach was red with blood.

29:09.001 --> 29:11.721
- Oh no, I don't like that at all.

29:11.721 --> 29:14.638
I much prefer the prettier version.

29:17.189 --> 29:20.856
Anyway Amy's version
is far more believable.

29:22.677 --> 29:26.344
They are stuck in the
Dark Ages around here.

29:27.865 --> 29:29.711
You don't seriously believe in witches?

29:29.711 --> 29:32.461
(cheerful music)

29:46.541 --> 29:48.840
- What are you doing with
that, that's one of the prices.

29:48.840 --> 29:50.289
- All right, all right.
- Playing with that,

29:50.289 --> 29:53.037
you'll spoil it, I
thought agreed to help me.

29:53.037 --> 29:55.930
- Okay, okay I'll sort these things out.

29:55.930 --> 29:58.211
- I'll (mumbling).
- Yup.

29:58.211 --> 30:00.378
(humming)

30:13.913 --> 30:17.032
- Look, it's Cassie and her dad.

30:17.032 --> 30:20.089
- It's horrible, I had
no idea she was so bad.

30:20.089 --> 30:21.453
- We should go over and talk with him.

30:21.453 --> 30:25.179
- No, I mean what's the point
it's not like we can help her.

30:25.179 --> 30:27.028
- But it's so tragic.

30:27.028 --> 30:29.278
- Yeah but we don't have...

30:31.028 --> 30:33.454
- Hi Mr. Rundle, we were
just saying how glad we are

30:33.454 --> 30:36.131
now that Cassie is back.

30:36.131 --> 30:36.964
- Really?

30:37.936 --> 30:40.203
- We were hoping we could
look after her for a while,

30:40.203 --> 30:41.453
weren't we Amy?

30:44.202 --> 30:47.369
We could show her the window displays.

30:56.164 --> 30:56.997
- Okay.

31:08.241 --> 31:11.241
- And now the highlight of our tour.

31:13.272 --> 31:14.772
Please, after you.

31:28.179 --> 31:29.179
- Oh my God.

31:37.549 --> 31:38.632
Who did that?

31:42.256 --> 31:44.089
- Much friendlier now.

31:52.954 --> 31:54.954
- Let's get out of here.

31:56.830 --> 31:58.507
♫ I wanna be with you

31:58.507 --> 32:00.674
(humming)

32:04.867 --> 32:07.700
♫ I wanna see you

32:08.978 --> 32:11.145
♫ Oh yeah

32:12.354 --> 32:15.200
- Oh hello girls, do
you want a to have a go.

32:15.200 --> 32:16.401
We've got some lovely prizes.

32:16.401 --> 32:17.734
- No thanks Mom.

32:19.369 --> 32:21.557
- I will I can't resist a little flutter.

32:21.557 --> 32:22.557
- Oh lovely.

32:32.619 --> 32:33.662
Nevermind.

32:33.662 --> 32:37.289
- Oh what a shame, oh do
you want to try again?

32:37.289 --> 32:38.888
- No thanks.

32:38.888 --> 32:41.868
- Are you sure, we've
got some (mumbling) left.

32:41.868 --> 32:42.826
- Have you?

32:42.826 --> 32:45.802
- Tell you what, how
about five for a fiver?

32:45.802 --> 32:46.635
- Mom.

32:48.159 --> 32:50.091
- Sure to win.

32:50.091 --> 32:51.711
- Go on then.

32:51.711 --> 32:54.281
- These are out of date.
- Ssshht you!

32:54.281 --> 32:58.493
- What is this, 2010,
you can't give that away!

32:58.493 --> 33:00.879
- It's for a very good cause.

33:00.879 --> 33:01.965
- Mom!

33:01.965 --> 33:05.632
- I told her myself,
she won't listen to me.

33:09.826 --> 33:11.184
- Not my lucky day.

33:11.184 --> 33:12.417
- Do you want to try again?

33:12.417 --> 33:13.750
- No, no.

33:13.750 --> 33:16.500
(cheerful music)

33:22.263 --> 33:24.416
- [Lindsey] There we are,
I hope that's comfortable.

33:24.416 --> 33:27.285
- She can't hear you.
- How do you know?

33:27.285 --> 33:29.515
She might know everything
that's going on, it can

33:29.515 --> 33:31.273
happen sometimes, I read about it.

33:31.273 --> 33:34.482
- You're joking?
- No seriously.

33:34.482 --> 33:36.872
Wouldn't it be awful, can
you imagine being trapped

33:36.872 --> 33:39.040
like that, unable to
move but still conscious.

33:39.040 --> 33:42.790
- Oh shut up, I don't
want to think about it.

33:45.563 --> 33:47.610
What happened to her anyway.

33:47.610 --> 33:52.162
- No one knows exactly she must
have fallen off the seawall.

33:52.162 --> 33:54.741
It happened this day last
year, it was late at night and

33:54.741 --> 33:57.574
apparently she had a lot to drink.

33:58.752 --> 34:01.502
- You don't think she was pushed?

34:03.324 --> 34:04.907
- No of course not.

34:06.158 --> 34:10.527
I mean, I could she could be
a, a bit of a cow sometimes,

34:10.527 --> 34:14.444
but surely no one would
really try to kill her?

34:19.295 --> 34:21.629
- Oh look it's the comedian.

34:29.141 --> 34:30.473
- Hey did you see that?

34:30.473 --> 34:31.371
- What?

34:31.371 --> 34:34.838
- Well that Scareycrow just moved.

34:34.838 --> 34:36.359
- One of your friends was it?

34:36.359 --> 34:38.025
- No, no, seriously.

34:39.694 --> 34:42.080
- Wasn't it over there just now?

34:42.080 --> 34:43.112
- Wasn't what?

34:43.112 --> 34:45.952
- Well that Scareycrow
in the green trousers,

34:45.952 --> 34:48.119
I swear it was over there.

34:49.060 --> 34:52.234
- I don't know they're everywhere.

34:52.234 --> 34:54.567
- Geez, there's another one.

34:58.764 --> 35:01.282
- I don't know about you
lot but after all this

35:01.282 --> 35:03.699
entertainment I need a drink.

35:05.363 --> 35:06.198
- Good plan.

35:06.198 --> 35:08.948
(cheerful music)

35:22.252 --> 35:25.502
(high-pitched singing)

35:31.426 --> 35:34.093
(ominous music)

35:42.018 --> 35:43.435
- Oh hey you two.

35:45.732 --> 35:47.380
We're heading to the pub, you coming?

35:47.380 --> 35:48.996
- Yeah sure.
- Yeah.

35:48.996 --> 35:50.996
I could do with a drink.

35:51.946 --> 35:53.196
- Oh, how cute.

35:59.849 --> 36:00.986
- It's watching us.

36:00.986 --> 36:02.301
- Oh Dillon it's not funny.

36:02.301 --> 36:05.143
- I'm not joking.
- Give it a rest okay?

36:05.143 --> 36:07.939
- We should tell someone.
- Has he been on drugs again?

36:07.939 --> 36:10.790
- Oh don't panic Dillon,
we'll protect you.

36:10.790 --> 36:13.229
They're only made out of
straw after all, here.

36:13.229 --> 36:15.896
(ominous music)

36:20.296 --> 36:21.129
See?

36:22.607 --> 36:24.912
(neck snapping)
(screaming)

36:24.912 --> 36:27.995
(anticipatory music)

36:39.678 --> 36:42.180
- Shit.
- There's no signal!

36:42.180 --> 36:45.263
- We can use the landline in the pub!

36:54.367 --> 36:56.316
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

36:56.316 --> 36:57.993
- You've got to let us in!
- ID please!

36:57.993 --> 37:00.203
- We need your phone, it's an emergency.

37:00.203 --> 37:02.626
- Passport, driving
license or photographic ID.

37:02.626 --> 37:05.559
- My boyfriend is dead,
you have to let us in.

37:05.559 --> 37:06.976
- Coming through.

37:08.279 --> 37:10.159
(screaming)

37:10.159 --> 37:11.893
- We need your phone!
- 999!

37:11.893 --> 37:13.143
- Now!
- Please!

37:18.038 --> 37:19.038
- It's dead.

37:22.193 --> 37:23.076
- That's weird.

37:23.076 --> 37:24.224
- Are there any other phones?

37:24.224 --> 37:26.205
- No.
- What are we gonna do?

37:26.205 --> 37:29.253
- The Scareycrows,
they're all on the lawn.

37:29.253 --> 37:31.102
- We have to warn everyone.

37:31.102 --> 37:32.376
- What about her?

37:32.376 --> 37:33.698
- We'll have to leave her here.

37:33.698 --> 37:36.916
- You can't do that.
- It's fine, she's over 21.

37:36.916 --> 37:39.999
(anticipatory music)

38:06.370 --> 38:07.705
- Go home it's not safe!

38:07.705 --> 38:10.027
- But we caught something!

38:10.027 --> 38:12.360
(screaming)

38:18.554 --> 38:22.348
- Piss off mate, it's not
Halloween, don't think

38:22.348 --> 38:25.629
you're coming in dressed like that.

38:25.629 --> 38:27.879
(groaning)

38:33.178 --> 38:35.187
- No she was on the lawn
earlier, I haven't seen her

38:35.187 --> 38:36.020
since then.

38:36.020 --> 38:38.103
- All right okay, thanks.

38:42.037 --> 38:44.667
- Thank you so much everbody for coming,

38:44.667 --> 38:47.758
(mumbling), so we have
our third prize winner...

38:47.758 --> 38:49.661
(shouting over each other)

38:49.661 --> 38:51.166
Look at this, look at
this, the weapon and...

38:51.166 --> 38:51.999
- What is it?

38:51.999 --> 38:53.124
(shouting over each other)

38:53.124 --> 38:54.121
One at a time!

38:54.121 --> 38:55.941
- Our second prize is...

38:55.941 --> 38:56.840
- You first!

38:56.840 --> 38:58.700
- My boyfriend's been attacked he's dead.

38:58.700 --> 38:59.606
- You're driving me on.

38:59.606 --> 39:01.332
- Our first prize winner...

39:01.332 --> 39:03.410
- And my Nathan, he was
missing and now they've just

39:03.410 --> 39:05.069
fished his head out of the brink.

39:05.069 --> 39:07.373
- Thank you so much, all of you.

39:07.373 --> 39:09.683
(applauding)

39:09.683 --> 39:10.962
- Listen, I don't know what you--

39:10.962 --> 39:11.905
(screaming)

39:11.905 --> 39:13.095
- Look!

39:13.095 --> 39:14.335
- I'm calling for backup.

39:14.335 --> 39:16.293
Code red, this is Summers, control...

39:16.293 --> 39:18.293
- What's she doing here?

39:20.469 --> 39:24.636
(screaming)
(anticipatory music)

39:32.515 --> 39:35.598
- Stop, I'm gonna have to detain you!

39:37.596 --> 39:39.096
Stop now, come on!

39:40.429 --> 39:43.512
(anticipatory music)

39:46.318 --> 39:48.818
- Mom, Mom, listen, go!
- What?

39:50.923 --> 39:53.590
- Listen to me, go, move it, go!

39:57.767 --> 39:58.600
Ryan!

40:20.924 --> 40:21.757
Josh!

40:22.645 --> 40:24.085
(eerie music)

40:24.085 --> 40:28.252
(shushing)
(screaming)

40:41.419 --> 40:43.918
(car engine stalling)
(anticipatory music)

40:43.918 --> 40:45.345
- Start you bastard!

40:45.345 --> 40:47.031
- What's wrong?

40:47.031 --> 40:48.600
- I don't know, it's dead.

40:48.600 --> 40:50.706
- We've gotta find somewhere safe.

40:50.706 --> 40:51.539
- Where?

41:04.325 --> 41:05.574
(church organ music)

41:05.574 --> 41:06.788
- You can't do that.

41:06.788 --> 41:08.073
- Why not.

41:08.073 --> 41:10.747
- This is the house of God,
it's open for everyone.

41:10.747 --> 41:14.914
- Not today it's not, it's
every woman for herself.

41:18.143 --> 41:21.226
(anticipatory music)

41:24.946 --> 41:26.196
- What's wrong?

41:29.053 --> 41:30.553
Take your top off.

41:31.871 --> 41:33.202
- Why?

41:33.202 --> 41:35.307
- They'll see it.

41:35.307 --> 41:38.140
- Mother, if you could see me now.

41:50.044 --> 41:52.044
- Run, come on let's go!

42:00.827 --> 42:02.654
- Do you think they're gone?

42:02.654 --> 42:04.214
Do you think they'll come back?

42:04.214 --> 42:07.212
- I don't know, I don't know.

42:07.212 --> 42:09.767
We'll be safer in a building.

42:09.767 --> 42:11.517
- But they'll see us.

42:14.706 --> 42:17.373
- They must be somewhere nearby.

42:19.232 --> 42:21.982
(peaceful music)

42:26.066 --> 42:28.041
- Please forgive me for the
mean thoughts I had about

42:28.041 --> 42:32.208
my poor Nathan, I had no
idea he had his head cut off.

42:35.724 --> 42:38.079
I suppose that's why he didn't meet me.

42:38.079 --> 42:41.925
I should have known he
wouldn't have just gone off.

42:41.925 --> 42:44.970
He was such a lovely person.

42:44.970 --> 42:47.645
Such a lovely, lovely person.

42:47.645 --> 42:48.728
- Get a grip.

42:50.021 --> 42:54.188
(screaming)
(eerie music)

43:04.341 --> 43:05.174
- Dillon!

43:07.009 --> 43:07.842
- Ryan!

43:09.437 --> 43:13.604
(scuffling)
(anticipatory music)

43:14.683 --> 43:15.623
- Get the ax.

43:15.623 --> 43:16.943
- Right.

43:16.943 --> 43:17.776
- Hit it.

43:20.485 --> 43:21.318
Hit it!

43:24.663 --> 43:25.496
Harder!

43:26.375 --> 43:28.458
Cut his fucking head off!

43:39.373 --> 43:42.540
Not so tough now are you Mr. Strawman?

44:02.606 --> 44:04.606
- Wait someone's coming.

44:06.495 --> 44:09.578
Look it's the guys, come on let's go.

44:38.053 --> 44:39.136
- It's Simon.

44:41.851 --> 44:45.768
Let us in you dickhead
we know you're in there.

44:47.100 --> 44:48.157
- Yes?

44:48.157 --> 44:51.408
- Let us in.
- Get back, get back!

44:51.408 --> 44:53.490
This building is only open
during office hours and--

44:53.490 --> 44:55.407
- Scareycrow invasions.

45:08.179 --> 45:10.344
Why are you here?

45:10.344 --> 45:14.634
- Me, I thought the
station, someone should--

45:14.634 --> 45:15.671
- Because he's hiding.

45:15.671 --> 45:17.642
- No I'm not, I made a
strategic withdrawal until

45:17.642 --> 45:18.892
backup arrives.

45:19.960 --> 45:21.148
- Good plan.

45:21.148 --> 45:22.082
- Help's on the way then?

45:22.082 --> 45:24.974
- No I'm afraid not,
(mumbling) radio is dead.

45:24.974 --> 45:26.086
- Why?

45:26.086 --> 45:27.253
- It's Cassie.

45:28.117 --> 45:30.024
I know it is.

45:30.024 --> 45:31.298
- But how?

45:31.298 --> 45:33.768
- I don't know, but it's her.

45:33.768 --> 45:36.239
It must be, she's
blocking all the signals.

45:36.239 --> 45:38.045
- It's not just phones, it's cars too.

45:38.045 --> 45:39.738
- Yeah it's true, nothing's moving.

45:39.738 --> 45:42.916
- So no communication, no way out,

45:42.916 --> 45:46.087
and a town full of homicidal Scareycrows?

45:46.087 --> 45:47.047
Perfect.

45:47.047 --> 45:48.714
- What do we do now?

45:51.709 --> 45:53.354
- In the circumstances I
think there's only one thing

45:53.354 --> 45:54.187
we can do.

46:01.123 --> 46:03.560
- But if it is Cassie
then why is she doing it?

46:03.560 --> 46:06.581
- Because she's evil.
- She always hated everyone.

46:06.581 --> 46:09.992
- And now she's found a
way of killing people.

46:09.992 --> 46:13.246
- But it's not everyone is it?
- How do you mean?

46:13.246 --> 46:15.620
- Because it wasn't just
random, the Scareycrows,

46:15.620 --> 46:17.352
they're targeting people.

46:17.352 --> 46:18.425
- Do you think?

46:18.425 --> 46:21.522
- Nathan disappeared first,
then Alex was attacked,

46:21.522 --> 46:24.078
then Josh, then Ryan.

46:24.078 --> 46:27.773
- All guys, strange but if you'd ask me,

46:27.773 --> 46:29.742
I would've thought that
Cassie was hating girls

46:29.742 --> 46:30.751
more than guys.

46:30.751 --> 46:32.809
- Well there must be a
reason, what have they all

46:32.809 --> 46:33.976
got in common?

46:35.058 --> 46:36.058
- Thank God!

46:37.441 --> 46:38.579
I'm safe!

46:38.579 --> 46:39.696
- Why?

46:39.696 --> 46:42.871
- Oh you don't get it, that's
all the guys she screwed.

46:42.871 --> 46:44.829
Alex, Nathan, Josh, Ryan.

46:44.829 --> 46:46.079
- [Group] What?

46:47.592 --> 46:48.425
- What?

46:50.451 --> 46:52.201
- Forget I said that.

46:54.781 --> 46:56.031
- Is that true?

46:58.956 --> 47:01.063
- Listen it wasn't like that.

47:01.063 --> 47:03.896
- Really, then how was it exactly?

47:05.217 --> 47:07.800
- Please just listen all right?

47:08.679 --> 47:10.346
Amy it was ages ago.

47:12.387 --> 47:14.280
Long before I started seeing you honestly

47:14.280 --> 47:16.699
you gotta believe me.

47:16.699 --> 47:17.782
- Keep going.

47:19.170 --> 47:20.920
- It was just a once.

47:23.742 --> 47:27.909
I didn't wanna have anything
to do with her after that.

47:29.056 --> 47:33.056
But last year on Scareycrow
night, she was drunk

47:33.917 --> 47:36.239
and she would not leave me alone.

47:36.239 --> 47:37.989
- Oh really?
- She works there.

47:37.989 --> 47:38.993
- She was battered.

47:38.993 --> 47:41.243
(laughing)

47:43.270 --> 47:45.079
- That's so romantic.

47:45.079 --> 47:46.220
- I'm still in love
with her you know that?

47:46.220 --> 47:48.344
- Yeah, oh really?

47:48.344 --> 47:49.177
- Ryan.

47:50.221 --> 47:51.296
- Cassie please.

47:51.296 --> 47:52.538
- Oh come on baby.

47:52.538 --> 47:54.996
(laughing)

47:54.996 --> 47:55.959
Let's get together.

47:55.959 --> 47:57.204
- Cut it out.

47:57.204 --> 47:58.745
- Sorry love I don't
think he's interested.

47:58.745 --> 48:00.662
- Yeah well he will be.

48:01.824 --> 48:03.468
I know what he likes.

48:03.468 --> 48:06.941
- No, no, no, no, no, I'm with Amy now.

48:06.941 --> 48:08.858
- What do I have to do?

48:09.878 --> 48:11.876
Put a spell on you?

48:11.876 --> 48:14.043
- Look just fuck off okay?

48:28.618 --> 48:30.868
Then I saw her watching us.

48:31.934 --> 48:33.951
And it was just after
that when you collapsed.

48:33.951 --> 48:38.118
(groaning)
(giggling)

48:39.540 --> 48:41.807
I wanted to get into
the ambulance with you,

48:41.807 --> 48:44.618
but your parents were there.

48:44.618 --> 48:46.285
I was just helpless.

48:48.660 --> 48:50.478
And so the others tried to calm me down

48:50.478 --> 48:53.478
and they took me to the seawall and,

48:55.424 --> 48:57.757
that's when it all happened.

49:01.794 --> 49:05.549
- Look, don't worry Ryan, she'll be okay.

49:05.549 --> 49:06.799
- No she won't.

49:12.067 --> 49:14.734
Just forget her, she's gone now.

49:17.896 --> 49:19.896
- What the hell is that?

49:21.954 --> 49:22.787
- Hey!

49:24.314 --> 49:25.429
You're evil.

49:25.429 --> 49:29.450
- No I am strong and you
are weak, all of you!

49:29.450 --> 49:31.133
- She's mental.

49:31.133 --> 49:33.383
(groaning)

49:34.365 --> 49:36.930
- You're all too scared
to have what you want now,

49:36.930 --> 49:37.930
but I'm not.

49:38.962 --> 49:40.212
- Hey, stop it.

49:41.930 --> 49:44.122
Look I said stop it.

49:44.122 --> 49:47.205
(anticipatory music)

49:49.469 --> 49:51.802
(screaming)

49:52.799 --> 49:53.632
Shit!

50:00.620 --> 50:02.620
- You should've told me.

50:03.962 --> 50:06.446
- I didn't think you'd understand.

50:06.446 --> 50:08.446
- No you're right there.

50:10.367 --> 50:14.280
- As soon as I saw what had happened,

50:14.280 --> 50:17.746
when she landed on the rocks
I went in and pulled her out.

50:17.746 --> 50:20.338
- And let everyone
believe you were a hero.

50:20.338 --> 50:22.688
- No I didn't want that.

50:22.688 --> 50:25.105
- You could've told me, Ryan.

50:27.625 --> 50:29.375
You could've told me.

50:33.409 --> 50:34.409
- I'm sorry.

50:36.286 --> 50:39.536
- I thought I could trust him.
- I know.

50:41.614 --> 50:43.031
I trusted Nathan.

50:45.488 --> 50:49.655
It's hard when you realize
your boyfriend's an asshole.

50:54.058 --> 50:58.225
- Sometimes it's hard to
see any purpose in anything.

51:09.771 --> 51:13.113
- There's one good thing
to come of all of this.

51:13.113 --> 51:14.013
- Really?

51:14.013 --> 51:16.980
- Yes at least we know who's she after.

51:16.980 --> 51:19.953
She's probably not interested
in the rest of us at all,

51:19.953 --> 51:21.691
if that, I'm going home.

51:21.691 --> 51:23.231
- You can't do that.

51:23.231 --> 51:27.428
I can't guarantee your safety
if you leave these premises.

51:27.428 --> 51:30.477
- Simon, you couldn't guarantee my safety

51:30.477 --> 51:33.948
crossing the road, think about it.

51:33.948 --> 51:37.572
If all these Scareycrows
are out to kill him,

51:37.572 --> 51:41.739
the best I can do is get as
far away as possible from him.

51:43.915 --> 51:45.649
- But they may be outside.

51:45.649 --> 51:48.774
- So, why would they
want me, I've never had

51:48.774 --> 51:52.941
any issues with Cassie, I
never tried to kill her.

51:54.295 --> 51:56.581
- I always try to be positive, try to

51:56.581 --> 52:00.748
look for a silver lining, to
see the best in people but...

52:05.692 --> 52:09.359
I guess we have to think
about other people.

52:10.559 --> 52:12.309
About their problems.

52:14.044 --> 52:16.711
About what it's like to be them.

52:20.526 --> 52:22.836
- What do you mean?

52:22.836 --> 52:24.836
- Cassie she's so alone.

52:28.599 --> 52:31.635
She's never had any real friends.

52:31.635 --> 52:34.635
Maybe she's never felt truly loved.

52:40.474 --> 52:42.724
- So, who's coming with me?

52:44.472 --> 52:45.555
Not you Ryan.

52:48.678 --> 52:51.687
Right, stay here and
be victims if you like,

52:51.687 --> 52:54.687
I'm going home for a nice warm bath.

52:58.870 --> 52:59.865
See you later.

52:59.865 --> 53:02.532
(ominous music)

53:04.943 --> 53:06.360
- I need to pray.

53:08.682 --> 53:12.849
(screaming)
(blood splattering)

53:18.032 --> 53:20.282
(groaning)

53:21.763 --> 53:24.596
- Oh my God, what are we gonna do.

53:45.656 --> 53:49.284
That's not enough, you're
the policeman, do something!

53:49.284 --> 53:52.567
- Like what?
- Anything, protect us!

53:52.567 --> 53:53.923
- With what?

53:53.923 --> 53:56.537
- How should I know, you're the machoman!

53:56.537 --> 54:00.013
- Listen, I bleed just as
much as you do remember?

54:00.013 --> 54:01.619
When I signed up the
training covered all sorts of

54:01.619 --> 54:04.883
situations but there was
no mention of being impaled

54:04.883 --> 54:06.791
by rampant Scareycrows.

54:06.791 --> 54:09.234
- But somebody has to do something.

54:09.234 --> 54:10.234
- All right.

54:16.980 --> 54:20.230
- It's okay Amy, I can see clearly now.

54:22.006 --> 54:24.062
- Clearly this is an emergency situation

54:24.062 --> 54:25.895
so I'm taking control.

54:27.937 --> 54:30.950
You'll all do exactly
as I say, we don't know

54:30.950 --> 54:32.728
how long this is gonna
last, so it's important

54:32.728 --> 54:36.895
that we all stick together
and support each other.

54:38.295 --> 54:40.545
- I need to speak with her.

54:42.001 --> 54:44.975
- It's time we take action,
we're gonna find the other two,

54:44.975 --> 54:46.872
move to the most secure
part of the building

54:46.872 --> 54:49.122
and barricade ourselves in.

54:51.212 --> 54:53.441
(door buzzer buzzing)

54:53.441 --> 54:54.858
No no, come back!

54:55.795 --> 54:57.462
- Lindsey!
- Lindsey?

55:00.470 --> 55:03.082
What the hell is she doing.

55:03.082 --> 55:04.865
- Praying.
- Lindsey!

55:04.865 --> 55:06.948
Get back in here at once!

55:08.156 --> 55:11.324
- I've come to share God's
love with you Cassie.

55:11.324 --> 55:12.986
Would you like to pray with me?

55:12.986 --> 55:16.069
(anticipatory music)

55:22.362 --> 55:24.362
- I think that was a no.

55:26.446 --> 55:29.548
(anticipatory music)

55:29.548 --> 55:31.913
- [Summers] We need to barricade.

55:31.913 --> 55:33.663
Move everything down!

55:35.721 --> 55:37.872
Come on everybody, come on!

55:37.872 --> 55:38.705
- Oh shit!

55:39.644 --> 55:43.811
(scuffling)
(groaning)

56:35.100 --> 56:35.933
- Now what?

56:35.933 --> 56:37.350
- Run!
- No, bike!

56:40.182 --> 56:41.709
- [Dillon] Where are we heading anyway?

56:41.709 --> 56:44.591
- (mumbling), I've got
the keys to Dad's unit.

56:44.591 --> 56:45.424
Amy, Amy!

56:47.940 --> 56:50.139
- Like I'm the gay guy
with the girl's bike.

56:50.139 --> 56:52.222
- Then leave it, come on!

56:54.912 --> 56:57.995
(anticipatory music)

57:17.449 --> 57:18.782
Declan, come on!

57:20.995 --> 57:22.578
- Coming!
- Come on!

57:34.059 --> 57:36.996
- Amy I need to talk to you.

57:36.996 --> 57:38.661
- Let's not now, Ryan.

57:38.661 --> 57:41.160
- Do you still love me?

57:41.160 --> 57:42.327
- No.
- Really?

57:44.753 --> 57:46.529
- Listen this really isn't the time to--

57:46.529 --> 57:50.747
- Look if I'm gonna die then
I need to know do you love me.

57:50.747 --> 57:51.881
- You're not gonna die.

57:51.881 --> 57:53.131
- Just tell me.

57:57.034 --> 57:58.617
- Okay, I love you.

58:00.199 --> 58:01.032
- Yes!

58:14.392 --> 58:16.826
- What is this place?

58:16.826 --> 58:18.599
- My dad works here.

58:18.599 --> 58:20.291
- And you have a key because?

58:20.291 --> 58:21.708
- Does it matter?

58:22.597 --> 58:25.014
- No, I'm not going in there.

58:26.603 --> 58:30.103
- Fine stay out here with the Scareycrows.

58:33.094 --> 58:34.427
Okay, follow me.

58:35.640 --> 58:37.307
- It's not that bad.

58:39.764 --> 58:43.724
- No I can't, it smells like
(speaking foreign language).

58:43.724 --> 58:46.724
- My mom got me that last Christmas.

58:47.989 --> 58:50.156
- Can't we just stay here?

58:51.520 --> 58:54.853
This is ridiculous where are the lights?

58:58.879 --> 59:01.129
- Oh no, I don't like this.

59:07.474 --> 59:09.024
- So what are we gonna do?

59:09.024 --> 59:10.971
- Nothing.
- Nothing?

59:10.971 --> 59:13.359
- You mean just wait
for Cassie to find us?

59:13.359 --> 59:16.079
- Yeah this place is like a
bunker we'll be safe here.

59:16.079 --> 59:17.858
- That's what they told Hitler.

59:17.858 --> 59:20.695
- Nowhere safe, Cassie's
cut out the phones,

59:20.695 --> 59:24.862
she stopped the cars, God
knows what else she can do.

59:27.366 --> 59:29.033
- Yeah you're right.

59:31.232 --> 59:34.555
Look I'm sorry Amy guys
this was a mistake.

59:34.555 --> 59:36.121
- What do you mean?

59:36.121 --> 59:38.454
- Well it's me Cassie wants.

59:39.722 --> 59:41.288
Running away is not gonna solve anything,

59:41.288 --> 59:42.941
I might as well just go
out there and face her.

59:42.941 --> 59:43.774
- No.

59:46.399 --> 59:51.256
- Look, I love you, and I
would do anything for you.

59:51.256 --> 59:53.484
- You're not going anywhere.

59:53.484 --> 59:56.121
- Look if he wants to be a hero.

59:56.121 --> 59:58.954
- Shut it Declan, I've had enough.

01:00:00.247 --> 01:00:02.564
From now on, we're doing this my way.

01:00:02.564 --> 01:00:03.588
- No but there is no--

01:00:03.588 --> 01:00:05.462
- It's not about you anymore.

01:00:05.462 --> 01:00:09.129
Cassie killed Lindsey
didn't she, and Simon.

01:00:10.163 --> 01:00:12.746
We have to start fighting back.

01:00:16.245 --> 01:00:18.604
Ryan is right about one thing,

01:00:18.604 --> 01:00:21.187
he's the one that Cassie wants.

01:00:22.218 --> 01:00:24.594
So I think we should let her have him.

01:00:24.594 --> 01:00:25.427
- What?

01:00:25.427 --> 01:00:27.677
- Makes sense to me.
- Listen.

01:00:27.677 --> 01:00:31.776
If Cassie has these weird
powers, she's gonna find us.

01:00:31.776 --> 01:00:34.953
But if we're lucky, it
won't be for a while,

01:00:34.953 --> 01:00:37.510
I think we should be ready.

01:00:37.510 --> 01:00:39.825
- You mean set a trap?

01:00:39.825 --> 01:00:42.606
- What with me as the bait no way.

01:00:42.606 --> 01:00:44.494
- Whatever happened to I love you Amy,

01:00:44.494 --> 01:00:45.695
I'd do anything for you Amy.

01:00:45.695 --> 01:00:47.710
- If we surprise her, maybe
we can catch her on her own.

01:00:47.710 --> 01:00:49.519
- Look, if I'm supposed to be the bait

01:00:49.519 --> 01:00:50.908
then who the hell is
gonna take out Cassie?

01:00:50.908 --> 01:00:53.557
- And with what, we
don't have any weapons.

01:00:53.557 --> 01:00:56.386
Unless we're supposed to
batter her with spanners.

01:00:56.386 --> 01:01:00.571
- Oh, batter a girl in
a wheelchair, bad karma.

01:01:00.571 --> 01:01:03.488
- She's not a girl in a wheelchair.

01:01:05.379 --> 01:01:09.129
She's the bitch that
murdered my best friend.

01:01:11.952 --> 01:01:13.952
I'll do it, for Lindsey.

01:01:14.981 --> 01:01:18.064
(anticipatory music)

01:01:35.402 --> 01:01:37.402
- Cassie, you've got me.

01:01:38.496 --> 01:01:42.329
I'm all on my own, there's
no one else around.

01:01:47.731 --> 01:01:52.212
It's what you wanted
though wasn't it Cassie?

01:01:52.212 --> 01:01:53.545
Just you and me?

01:01:57.429 --> 01:01:58.654
- Now!

01:01:58.654 --> 01:02:02.821
(anticipatory music)
(scuffling)

01:02:10.461 --> 01:02:11.294
- Hit her!

01:02:27.911 --> 01:02:29.244
- [Dillon] Shit!

01:02:38.180 --> 01:02:39.013
- Amy!

01:02:45.711 --> 01:02:48.044
(scuffling)

01:02:58.344 --> 01:02:59.261
- One down.

01:03:03.827 --> 01:03:04.910
Are you okay?

01:03:07.564 --> 01:03:09.814
(sneezing)

01:03:12.005 --> 01:03:13.338
- No, hay fever.

01:03:15.351 --> 01:03:19.518
(screaming)
(scuffling)

01:03:27.863 --> 01:03:31.246
(ominous music)

01:03:31.246 --> 01:03:32.079
- Cassie.

01:03:34.159 --> 01:03:35.159
Let them go.

01:03:36.798 --> 01:03:39.798
They've got nothing to do with this.

01:03:41.610 --> 01:03:42.610
Let them go.

01:03:47.098 --> 01:03:48.681
I said let them go.

01:03:50.675 --> 01:03:51.925
Let him go now.

01:03:53.927 --> 01:03:56.827
- Yeah you're not helping.

01:03:56.827 --> 01:03:58.160
- Please Cassie.

01:04:01.252 --> 01:04:02.169
- Bad move.

01:04:03.555 --> 01:04:05.472
Never beg a psychopath.

01:04:12.940 --> 01:04:15.273
(screaming)

01:04:20.343 --> 01:04:22.593
(laughing)

01:04:32.646 --> 01:04:36.839
- Okay, okay we get it,
you've got the power here,

01:04:36.839 --> 01:04:40.013
you just do not need to kill anybody else.

01:04:40.013 --> 01:04:42.096
- [Declan] Oh my fingers!

01:04:43.136 --> 01:04:44.553
- Please, please.

01:04:46.785 --> 01:04:47.618
Cassie?

01:04:50.288 --> 01:04:53.705
- [Declan] I can't style without fingers!

01:04:56.614 --> 01:04:58.031
- Just calm down.

01:05:02.665 --> 01:05:06.832
(screaming)
(sudden sting)

01:05:10.885 --> 01:05:11.931
Come on!

01:05:11.931 --> 01:05:13.882
- Not without my fingers!

01:05:13.882 --> 01:05:15.206
- Are you joking?

01:05:15.206 --> 01:05:17.111
- (mumbling) with those fingers!

01:05:17.111 --> 01:05:18.220
- Not anymore!

01:05:18.220 --> 01:05:21.470
- Nonsense, surgeons can work miracles.

01:05:23.639 --> 01:05:25.556
Oh my God, there's one.

01:05:33.293 --> 01:05:34.460
Come to daddy.

01:05:36.237 --> 01:05:40.317
- Okay, now (muttering), come on.

01:05:40.317 --> 01:05:43.400
(anticipatory music)

01:06:05.290 --> 01:06:07.623
(screaming)

01:06:31.910 --> 01:06:34.243
(screaming)

01:06:54.597 --> 01:06:58.764
(weeping)
(shushing)

01:07:03.838 --> 01:07:07.005
(anticipatory music)

01:07:33.290 --> 01:07:35.540
(groaning)

01:07:48.184 --> 01:07:50.517
(screaming)

01:08:59.203 --> 01:09:02.453
- Yeah, yeah okay thanks I'll tell him.

01:09:03.385 --> 01:09:05.475
Hey, the ambulance is on
its way, they say they got

01:09:05.475 --> 01:09:08.464
a surgeon waiting for you.

01:09:08.464 --> 01:09:10.546
- Oh good, a perfect end.

01:09:13.419 --> 01:09:15.002
To the perfect day.

01:09:17.390 --> 01:09:18.792
(sad music)

01:09:18.792 --> 01:09:19.625
- Ryan?

01:09:20.776 --> 01:09:22.301
- Yeah?

01:09:22.301 --> 01:09:24.450
- Are you still going?

01:09:24.450 --> 01:09:25.283
- What?

01:09:26.912 --> 01:09:31.078
- To London and if you are I
think I might come with you.

01:09:32.702 --> 01:09:34.952
(laughing)

01:09:42.162 --> 01:09:45.828
I think I've had enough
of Sidcombe for now.

01:09:49.349 --> 01:09:52.182
(soft rock music)

01:10:29.411 --> 01:10:33.407
♫ Well, you know he was
standing out from the crowd

01:10:33.407 --> 01:10:37.986
♫ Asking himself why I'm
not feeling his sound

01:10:37.986 --> 01:10:41.095
♫ Sleeping off (mumbling)

01:10:41.095 --> 01:10:43.281
♫ Here's how dreams are made

01:10:43.281 --> 01:10:45.775
♫ That's why you've been sold

01:10:45.775 --> 01:10:47.933
♫ (mumbling) begins to flame

01:10:47.933 --> 01:10:52.100
♫ Now it's easy and much
better, I'll never do it

01:10:57.814 --> 01:11:00.313
♫ You're a wayward country boy
