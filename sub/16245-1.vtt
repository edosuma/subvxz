03:52.879 --> 03:57.213
Well, old faithful,
that's your shooting
for the day.

03:57.284 --> 04:00.151
If we haven't rung up
at least two rabbits,

04:00.220 --> 04:02.745
we deserve
to go home empty-handed.

04:02.822 --> 04:07.452
Yeah.
Still, blessed are they
who expect nothing...

04:07.527 --> 04:09.757
for they shall not
be disappointed.

04:09.829 --> 04:15.563
Mmm. Fewer things in life
give a man more pleasure
than hunting.

04:15.635 --> 04:18.331
It satisfies
his primitive nature-

04:18.404 --> 04:21.738
striding through the woods,
picking up his kill.

04:21.808 --> 04:24.777
Well, come on,
old faithful.

04:24.844 --> 04:28.644
There's plump rabbits
waiting for the frying pan.

04:55.141 --> 04:59.134
If this can
had four legs and a tail,
we'd be eating it tonight.

Cor.

05:40.920 --> 05:45.414
A harmless potshot at a rabbit
and I'm a murderer- a killer.

05:45.492 --> 05:48.427
Mother always said
I'd come to a bad end.

05:48.495 --> 05:51.055
What in Hades were you
doing here anyway?

05:52.399 --> 05:56.426
I can't say that
I've seen you
around here before.

05:56.503 --> 06:00.462
No. If you're going
to get yourself shot,
do it where you're known.

Well, Worp,
you're a long way
from home.

06:20.226 --> 06:23.195
With the looks of it,
you won't get back
for Christmas. No.

06:25.932 --> 06:28.662
We're going to have
a cold, hard winter.

06:28.735 --> 06:32.398
Mmm. You might keep here
a long time-
an awful long time.

06:32.472 --> 06:34.633
Too long for me, Harry.

06:34.708 --> 06:36.642
Yes.

06:50.690 --> 06:52.681
Yes, ma'am?

06:56.296 --> 06:58.696
What seems to be
the trouble, Captain?

06:58.765 --> 07:03.498
Well, it's what
you might call
an unavoidable accident.

07:03.570 --> 07:06.801
He's dead.
Yes.

07:09.542 --> 07:13.706
I would say that he was.
Of course, that's
an unprofessional opinion.

07:13.780 --> 07:17.113
Yeah. Did you, uh-
Did you know him,
Miss Gravely?

07:17.183 --> 07:20.550
No. Doesn't live
around here?

07:20.620 --> 07:24.613
Well, he died around here.
That's what counts now.
Embarrassing.

07:24.691 --> 07:28.457
What do you plan
to do with him, Captain?

07:28.528 --> 07:33.864
Miss Gravely, without
cutting the hem off
truth garment,

07:33.933 --> 07:36.993
I'm gonna hide him,
cover him up,

07:37.070 --> 07:40.164
forget him.

07:42.041 --> 07:45.204
Are you never going
to inform the police,
Captain?

07:45.278 --> 07:48.441
No.
Forget you saw me,
Miss Gravely.

07:48.515 --> 07:50.449
Chase it out
of your mind,
for heaven's sake.

07:50.517 --> 07:53.179
It was an accident.
He was poking
around the clearing...

07:53.253 --> 07:56.313
and I thought
he was a rabbit
or something.

07:56.389 --> 08:00.086
It was a human error.
Ah, now, please, don't-

08:00.160 --> 08:03.459
Don't say anything
to anybody,
Miss Gravely.

08:05.131 --> 08:07.793
Do as you think best,
Captain.

08:07.867 --> 08:10.893
I'm sure you must have met
many similar situations...

08:10.970 --> 08:13.234
in your travels
in foreign lands.

08:13.306 --> 08:15.570
Yeah. I've seen
much worse things.

08:15.642 --> 08:17.576
I certainly won't
say anything.
Much worse things.

08:17.644 --> 08:19.771
I remember when
I was on the Orinoco.

08:19.846 --> 08:21.780
We had a Turk, a great,
big Turk there...

08:21.848 --> 08:23.782
running amuck
with a machete.

08:23.850 --> 08:26.546
Captain, if I were going
to hide an accident,
I shouldn't delay.

08:26.619 --> 08:31.420
Oh. Oh.
You're right as rain,
Miss Gravely.

08:31.491 --> 08:35.222
Yes.
You know something?
I'm glad I met you today.

08:35.294 --> 08:38.230
I feel better
for telling
somebody as warm,

08:38.298 --> 08:42.735
tender, understanding
as yourself.

08:42.802 --> 08:46.966
Well, on the contrary,
Captain. It-

08:47.040 --> 08:52.376
It- I'm certainly glad
if I helped you, Captain.

08:52.445 --> 08:55.573
Perhaps you would care
to come over for
some blueberry muffins...

08:55.648 --> 08:59.015
and coffee later on-
high-bush blueberries?

08:59.085 --> 09:01.645
Ah, well. This is
certainly something of
an interesting surprise.

09:01.721 --> 09:04.417
And perhaps a touch
of elderberry wine.
Oh.

09:04.490 --> 09:08.654
After all,
we've been neighbors
for nearly three years now...

09:08.728 --> 09:10.719
and we've never exchanged
social calls.

09:10.797 --> 09:13.823
You're right.
It's high time
I paid a call.

09:13.900 --> 09:17.768
What time?
Oh, say,
early this afternoon?

09:17.837 --> 09:21.534
I'll be there
with a clean shirt
and a hungry face.

09:21.608 --> 09:25.874
Do that.
You better be
going along now.

09:25.945 --> 09:27.879
Don't want to be
an accessory
after the fact.

09:29.249 --> 09:32.946
You are a considerate man,
Capt. Wiles.

09:36.589 --> 09:38.853

What did I
tell ya, Mommy?
Don't touch it, Arnie.

10:10.456 --> 10:15.052
There he is.
No. It can't be!
Harry!

10:17.530 --> 10:19.828
Harry.
Thank Providence,
the last of Harry.

10:19.899 --> 10:23.528
- <i>Who's Providence, Mommy?</i>
- A very good friend.

10:23.603 --> 10:26.163
Don't you know
who it is?
You said Harry.

10:26.239 --> 10:29.970
Can't you remember, Arnie?
Why don't he get up
and do something?

10:30.043 --> 10:33.809
He's asleep.
He's in a deep sleep-

10:33.880 --> 10:37.748
a deep, wonderful sleep.
How'd he hurt his head?

10:37.817 --> 10:40.149
Putting it where
it wasn't wanted
would be my guess.

10:40.219 --> 10:43.154
- <i>Will it get better?</i>
- Not if we're lucky.

10:44.891 --> 10:47.451
Let's run home
and I'll make you
some lemonade.

10:47.527 --> 10:51.054
<i>Will lemonade put me</i>
<i>in a wonderful, deep,</i>
<i>deep sleep, Mommy?</i>

10:51.130 --> 10:54.896
- <i>No, Arnie, but it's better</i>
<i>than no lemonade.</i>
- I don't understand that.

10:54.968 --> 10:57.061
Never mind.
Now, you just forget
you ever saw this man.

10:57.136 --> 10:59.070
Is there a special way
to forget?

10:59.138 --> 11:02.539
Just think of something else.
I think I'll try not
to see him tomorrow, Mommy.

11:02.608 --> 11:06.374
That's a good boy, Arnie.
Now, let's run home
and get that lemonade.

11:08.581 --> 11:11.482
She won't care
what I do with him.

11:27.033 --> 11:30.025

to pay their last respects.

15:11.023 --> 15:13.082
All my pictures

15:13.159 --> 15:15.889
So few cars.
They don't seem to-

15:15.962 --> 15:18.294
I guess the cider
takes their attention.
Cider?

15:18.364 --> 15:20.298
Cider, indeed.
Throw it away!
Drink it!

15:20.366 --> 15:23.961
No, I hate cider.

Well, I'm sorry, Mr. Marlow.
Let's get a look at

15:26.138 --> 15:29.938
- Hold it up.
- What good would it do

You don't deserve

Well, it might be better then.
But what sort
of people, Wiggy?

15:52.565 --> 15:56.296
What breed?
I'll tell you.
They're little people-

15:56.369 --> 15:59.532
little people

He sells 'em. Mechanical

Hmm. Doesn't he get paid
for being deputy sheriff?

17:45.177 --> 17:47.941
- Nope.
- Well, I did.

17:48.013 --> 17:50.140
And there shouldn't be
any shootin' around here.
<i>Why?</i>

17:50.216 --> 17:52.150
It's posted land,
that's why.

17:52.218 --> 17:56.154
Why's that?
<i>'Cause I posted it.</i>

17:56.222 --> 17:59.419
What you got against people
doing a little shooting now and
then- let off a little steam?

17:59.492 --> 18:02.120
Bullets and guns
are dangerous.
They kill things.

18:02.194 --> 18:05.391
No one around here
could hit a freight car
with a cannon.

18:06.866 --> 18:10.165
I guess you're right, Sam.
All the same,
the law's the law.

18:10.236 --> 18:13.399
And I got a good mind
to scout around and find out
who's doin' the shootin'...

18:13.472 --> 18:15.667
and level a little fine.

18:15.741 --> 18:17.675

19:42.294 --> 19:45.855
You sing it so beautifully.
You wrote it yourself,
of course.

19:45.931 --> 19:48.058
What do you want
to borrow?
Oh, dear.

19:48.133 --> 19:51.296
I just think people need
encouragement sometimes.
Don't you, Mr. Marlow?

19:51.370 --> 19:54.567
How'd you know my name?
Well, it's on
the pictures, isn't it?

19:54.640 --> 19:56.574
It's not supposed
to be readable.

19:56.642 --> 19:58.872
Oh, you can tell
it's not supposed to be.
They're very professional.

19:58.944 --> 20:01.139
Don't you think,
Mrs. Wiggs?

20:01.213 --> 20:05.206
Well, Miss Gravely,
all I know is
nobody buys them.

20:05.284 --> 20:08.481
Thank you for
<i>your</i> encouragement,
Miss Gravely.

20:08.554 --> 20:10.522
Well, now I wonder
how you know my name?

20:10.589 --> 20:12.955
Easy.
Wiggy just said it.
Wiggy.

20:13.025 --> 20:15.585
What a perfectly ridiculous
little nickname.

20:15.661 --> 20:18.152
Do you mind if I call you
Wiggy, Mrs. Wiggs?

20:18.230 --> 20:22.496
Not if you pay
all your bills on time.
All right, Mr. Marlow.

20:22.568 --> 20:28.165
Bacon, beans, cabbage,
sugar, salt, tea,
oleo margarine.

20:28.240 --> 20:31.471
$1.95.
Don't forget half
a package of cigarettes.

20:31.544 --> 20:34.604
Ah, yes.
Ten cents- two five.
That much?

20:37.516 --> 20:40.644
I don't seem to be able
to find the-
I know, Mr. Marlow.

20:40.719 --> 20:42.914
As soon as we sell
some of your paintings.

20:42.988 --> 20:44.922
<i>[Dog Barking]</i>

20:47.993 --> 20:50.723
Just a minute, Mr. Marlow.
Well, let me make
my position clear.

20:50.796 --> 20:52.730
Shh.

21:03.142 --> 21:06.908
- What do you think?
- I think it'll hold coffee.

21:08.814 --> 21:11.442
Will you try it,
Mr. Marlow?

21:19.091 --> 21:21.685
Put your finger
through the handle, please.

21:26.999 --> 21:29.559
How about the size?
What about the handle?

21:29.635 --> 21:32.468
Hmm?
I mean,
does it fit?

21:32.538 --> 21:37.168
Is it the right
finger size?
It's my finger size.

21:45.451 --> 21:47.783
- I'll take it.
- Fifteen cents.

21:47.853 --> 21:50.014
<i>And the saucer?</i>
Ten.

21:50.089 --> 21:52.080
<i>That seems</i>
<i>a fair price.</i>

21:52.157 --> 21:54.182
What's the finger size
got to do with it?

21:54.259 --> 21:59.162
Um, I wanted to be certain
it would fit a man-
a certain size man.

21:59.231 --> 22:01.165
A man?

22:01.233 --> 22:04.896
A certain somebody is
coming over to my cottage
this afternoon...

22:04.970 --> 22:08.098
Not really?
For coffee
and blueberry muffins.

22:08.173 --> 22:10.232
Why, you old
social butterfly, you.

22:10.309 --> 22:14.006
- Old?
- <i>That was figuratively</i>
<i>speaking, Miss Gravely.</i>

22:14.079 --> 22:17.742
<i>[Mrs. Wiggs]</i>
<i>I think we've got</i>
<i>a nearsighted cider customer.</i>

22:17.816 --> 22:20.341
<i>[Miss Gravely]</i>
<i>How old do you think</i>
<i>I am, young man?</i>

22:20.419 --> 22:25.288
Mmm. Fifty.
How old do you think
you are?

22:25.357 --> 22:29.794
Forty-two. I can show you
my birth certificate.
I'm afraid you're gonna...

22:29.862 --> 22:33.093
have to show more than
your birth certificate
to convince a man of that.

22:33.165 --> 22:36.464
What do you mean?
I mean you have
to show your character,

22:36.535 --> 22:39.527
the inner self,
the hidden qualities,

22:39.605 --> 22:42.665
the true Miss Gravely-
sensitive, young in feeling,

22:42.741 --> 22:45.539
timeless with love
and understanding.

22:45.611 --> 22:47.545
I can do it!

22:48.814 --> 22:51.942
- At least, I think
I can do it.
- Do what?

22:52.017 --> 22:53.951
Well, I think I'll just
go out and see what
that gentlemen wants.

22:54.019 --> 22:57.250
At a time like this?
Where are your scissors?
Outside.

22:57.322 --> 23:00.814
- We're going
to cut her hair.
- Hair?

23:00.893 --> 23:04.989
<i>We'll cut it short,</i>
<i>bring it up-to-date,</i>
<i>make a nice, romantic styling,</i>

23:05.064 --> 23:07.430
take ten years off
your birth certificate.

23:07.499 --> 23:10.161
How are you fixed for ribbon?
Should be some
around somewhere.

23:10.235 --> 23:12.430
Powder, rouge, lipstick?
I think so.

23:12.504 --> 23:15.200
Nothing cheap,
shoddy or obvious.

23:15.274 --> 23:18.675
Just youth,
gentility, character.

23:18.744 --> 23:21.042
I'll go out
and get the scissors.
You find the other things.

23:23.215 --> 23:26.150
<i>[Doorbells Jingling]</i>

23:26.218 --> 23:28.914
<i>[Door Closing]</i>

23:30.656 --> 23:32.590
[Humming]

23:35.661 --> 23:38.721
Ah, here they are.
Excuse me, young man.
L-

23:41.233 --> 23:43.167
Oh, well.

23:45.270 --> 23:47.500
All right, Ernest.
Let's go.

24:03.388 --> 24:07.552
Well, always grow back,
I guess.

24:07.626 --> 24:10.493
<i>[Horn Honking]</i>

24:10.562 --> 24:14.157
There's Calvin.
Is he alone?

24:14.233 --> 24:17.134
Yep. Guess he didn't
sell his car.

25:13.892 --> 25:16.588
<i>Hey! Would you mind</i>
<i>getting out</i>
<i>of my picture?</i>

26:17.489 --> 26:20.322
Next thing you know,
they'll be televising
the whole thing.

26:40.345 --> 26:42.279
Huh.

26:47.052 --> 26:48.986
This your body,
little man?

26:49.054 --> 26:52.546
Oh, don't turn me in.
It was an accident-
an accident pure and simple.

26:52.624 --> 26:54.717
I thought he was
a rabbit or a pheasant
or something.

26:54.793 --> 26:57.887
It could've happened to you.
Suppose we straighten
this whole thing out.

26:57.963 --> 27:00.158
Well, I guess that's
the only way out.

27:00.232 --> 27:02.860
First thing I seen
when I rolled out
this morning...

27:02.935 --> 27:08.100
was a double-breasted robin
drunk as a hoot owl from eating
fermented chokecherries.

27:08.173 --> 27:10.107
Right away I knew
somebody was in trouble.

27:10.175 --> 27:13.440
<i>What I didn't know</i>
<i>was that it was me.</i>
<i>[Scoffs]</i>

27:13.512 --> 27:16.879
<i>Well, the larder was empty</i>
<i>and I got to thinking about</i>
<i>a tooth full of fried rabbit.</i>

27:16.949 --> 27:19.213
<i>[Church Bells Ringing]</i>

27:19.284 --> 27:21.218
It stands to reason that
they can't touch you
for it.

27:21.286 --> 27:23.777
Nothing these days
stands to reason.

27:23.855 --> 27:26.915
It was accidental.
An act of God, perhaps.

27:28.860 --> 27:31.158
In a way you should be
grateful that you were able
to do your share...

27:31.229 --> 27:34.665
<i>in accomplishing</i>
<i>the destiny</i>
<i>of a fellow being.</i>

27:36.335 --> 27:38.803
Suppose, for instance,
it was written
in the Book of Heaven...

27:38.870 --> 27:40.804
that this man
was to die...

27:40.872 --> 27:43.864
at this particular time,
at this particular place.

27:43.942 --> 27:49.141
And suppose for a moment that
the actual accomplishing of
his departure had been bungled-

27:49.214 --> 27:51.148
something had gone wrong.

27:51.216 --> 27:53.912
Uh, perhaps it was meant
to be a thunderbolt...

27:53.986 --> 27:56.011
<i>and there was</i>
<i>no thunder available, say.</i>

27:56.088 --> 27:59.080
<i>Well, then you come along,</i>
<i>and you shoot him...</i>

27:59.157 --> 28:04.356
and heaven's will is done
and destiny fulfilled.

28:04.429 --> 28:07.523
Your conscience is quite clear.
You've got nothing
to worry about.

28:07.599 --> 28:09.999
Sammy, I haven't got
a conscience.

28:10.068 --> 28:12.059
And it's not heaven
that's worrying me...

28:12.137 --> 28:14.264
because I don't expect
I'll ever have to face it.

28:14.339 --> 28:16.773
And it's none of those
noble things you were
talking about. No.

28:16.842 --> 28:19.936
<i>Nothing like that.</i>
Then what is it?

28:20.012 --> 28:23.175
<i>[Sighs]</i>
<i>It's me. It's me that's</i>
<i>worrying me-</i>

28:23.248 --> 28:25.182
me and my future life.

28:25.250 --> 28:27.241
Oh, I know the police
and their suspicious ways.

28:27.319 --> 28:29.583
You're guilty until
you're proved innocent.

28:29.654 --> 28:31.849
And I want nothing more
to do with them.

28:31.923 --> 28:33.857
Bury him, I say,
and have done with him.

28:33.925 --> 28:37.088
He's no good to anyone now.
Lay him to rest.

28:37.162 --> 28:40.222
Put him under the sod.
Forget him.

28:40.298 --> 28:43.028
I never did it
and you never saw him.

28:43.101 --> 28:45.331
Yes. What about
all those other people
who saw him?

28:45.404 --> 28:48.396
How about the woman
and the little boy,
Miss Gravely and the tramp...

28:48.473 --> 28:51.135
and the man who was
reading the book-
Dr. Greenbow?

28:51.209 --> 28:55.942
<i>How about all of them?</i>
Well, nobody was interested,
I tell you.

28:56.014 --> 28:58.107
Nobody ever cared
until you came along.

28:58.183 --> 29:02.643
Ah, that's what you think.
Suppose someone starts to care
after you've buried him?

29:02.721 --> 29:05.781
I can't wait for people
to start caring whenever
they feel like it.

29:05.857 --> 29:08.382
I don't want
a little accident
to turn into a career.

29:08.460 --> 29:11.452
Suppose that woman
who called him Harry-

29:11.530 --> 29:13.555
Suppose she decides
she loves him after all.

29:13.632 --> 29:18.160
She was downright hysterical
with delight.
<i>Hmm? What was she like?</i>

29:18.236 --> 29:22.036
Pretty as a rainbow.
Wish I was
two years younger.

29:22.107 --> 29:24.598
<i>And with a little boy?</i>
Yeah, about four or five
years of age.

29:24.676 --> 29:27.611
Yeah. It's got to be
Mrs. Rogers and her son.

29:27.679 --> 29:30.671
Sammy, what do you say
we slip him underground...

29:30.749 --> 29:32.683
now that you've finished
drawing him, eh?

29:32.751 --> 29:35.049
We could discuss
the smaller details later.

29:35.120 --> 29:40.353
I don't like it.
The authorities like
to know when people die.

29:40.425 --> 29:44.156
All right, Sammy.
Forget it.

29:44.229 --> 29:46.322
You cut off home.

29:46.398 --> 29:48.764
I killed him
and I'll look after
his remains.

29:48.834 --> 29:51.564
What'll you do?
Drag him around the countryside
the rest of the day?

29:51.636 --> 29:55.868
Oh, I'll do my best.
That's all a man can do.

29:55.941 --> 29:58.842
If you're not careful,
you will get
a murder charge lined up.

29:58.910 --> 30:01.174
Matter of fact,
I'm beginning to suspect
something myself.

30:01.246 --> 30:05.046
There you are then. See?
If you, an artist,
suspect the worst,

30:05.117 --> 30:07.585
what are they,
the police,
going to think?

30:07.652 --> 30:10.143
What about that envelope
with his name
and address on it?

30:10.222 --> 30:12.588
By rights, you should
mail him back home.

30:12.657 --> 30:18.493
Sammy, have you forgotten
who carries the mail down
to the station every night?

30:18.563 --> 30:21.657
Calvin Wiggs,
deputy sheriff.

30:21.733 --> 30:27.569
Oh, yes. You're right.
I'll tell you what we'll do.
Tell you what.

30:27.639 --> 30:30.335
We'll find out how well
Mrs. Rogers knows this man,

30:30.408 --> 30:32.899
and whether she intends
to notify the police
of his death.

30:32.978 --> 30:36.379
What good will that do?
Why, a lot of good.

30:36.448 --> 30:38.382
If she's just
a distant friend of his...

30:38.450 --> 30:41.749
and doesn't intend
to notify the authorities,

30:41.820 --> 30:44.584
then I, personally,
will help you
bury Harry.

30:44.656 --> 30:48.592
Oh, Sammy!
You've signed on
for the cruise.

30:48.660 --> 30:50.594
[Chuckles]
What time is it?

30:53.064 --> 30:55.089
About noon.
Good heavens.

30:55.167 --> 30:57.601
I've got to go home
and spruce up. I've got
a date with Miss Gravely.

30:59.371 --> 31:02.738
Not you.
You are not the one.

31:02.807 --> 31:07.676
Oh, Sam. She could do
a lot worse, you know?

31:07.746 --> 31:10.909
Couldn't do any better.
Just think.

31:10.982 --> 31:14.975
You'd be establishing
a precedent.
I'm not establishing nothing.

31:15.053 --> 31:19.683
I am going over for some
blueberry muffins and coffee
by her own invitation,

31:20.959 --> 31:23.860
and possibly some
elderberry wine.

31:23.929 --> 31:26.193
Do you realize that you'll be
the first man to, uh,

31:27.432 --> 31:29.366
cross her threshold?

31:29.434 --> 31:35.066
Oh. Oh, it's not
too late, you know.
It's-

31:35.140 --> 31:38.735
She's a
well-preserved woman.
I envy you.

31:38.810 --> 31:41.278
Yes, very
well-preserved.

31:41.346 --> 31:45.009
And preserves have
to be opened someday.

31:45.083 --> 31:47.017
Hmm? Yes.

31:47.085 --> 31:49.679
Now, you just trot down
and see what Mrs. Rogers
has to say.

31:49.754 --> 31:53.121
How about hiding
Harry first?
Holy smoke!

31:53.191 --> 31:56.319
Forgetting a little detail
like that could hang a man.

31:56.394 --> 31:58.328
[Chuckles]
Yes.

32:23.955 --> 32:25.889
[Mumbling]

32:27.525 --> 32:29.459
[Grunting]

32:34.532 --> 32:37.558
Oh. Oh, I beg
your pardon.

32:37.636 --> 32:39.570
[Speaking Indistinctly]

32:48.713 --> 32:51.978
[Captain]
I hope I never have to be
operated on by Dr. Greenbow.

32:52.050 --> 32:53.984
Come on.
Let's get going.
Yeah.

33:54.612 --> 33:58.104
Good afternoon.

33:58.183 --> 34:00.447
You're beautiful,
wonderful.

34:00.518 --> 34:03.351
You're the most wonderful,
beautiful thing
I've ever seen.

34:03.421 --> 34:05.412
I'd like to paint you.

34:05.490 --> 34:09.620
Was there something else
you wanted, Mr. Marlow,
isn't it?

34:11.161 --> 34:14.962
You certainly are
a lovely woman.
I'd like to paint you nude.

34:15.033 --> 34:16.967
Some other time,
Mr. Marlow.

34:17.034 --> 34:20.664
I was about to make
Arnie some lemonade.
Oh, yes. Yes, of course.

34:20.739 --> 34:22.797
Perhaps I've come
at an awkward moment.

34:22.873 --> 34:25.672
If you want
to undress me,
you have.

34:25.744 --> 34:27.678
Well, it wasn't
exactly that.

34:27.746 --> 34:31.842
I came here to talk to you
about something, but after
I saw you, it slipped my mind.

34:31.916 --> 34:34.407
It couldn't have been
very important then.
Guess you're right.

34:35.920 --> 34:37.888
Why don't you sit down
on the porch?

34:37.956 --> 34:40.322
I'll get you a lemonade
and maybe you'll
think of it.

34:40.391 --> 34:42.724
You're not only beautiful,
you're considerate too.

34:44.728 --> 34:47.129
Arnie!
Hello, Mr. Marlow!

34:47.197 --> 34:49.132
Hi.
What do you got?
A rabbit?

34:49.199 --> 34:52.328
Dead.
What have you got?

34:52.404 --> 34:57.637
Oh, I got me a little frog.
[Yells]

34:57.709 --> 35:00.837
There he is.
It's hungry.
It needs a mother.

35:00.912 --> 35:02.777
[Yells]

35:04.215 --> 35:06.149
[Laughing]

35:06.217 --> 35:09.311
- <i>[Mrs. Rogers, Giggling]</i>
- I'll trade ya.

35:09.387 --> 35:12.481
Your mother
for mine?
The rabbit for the frog.

35:12.557 --> 35:18.086
It's yours, Arnie.
I think you got
the best deal.

35:18.163 --> 35:20.097
Dead rabbits don't eat.

35:20.165 --> 35:23.726
Well, I'll just take it
in the kitchen and
give him some lemonade.

35:31.409 --> 35:35.140
Four rabbit's feet,
and he got killed.

35:35.213 --> 35:39.479
He should've carried
a four-leaf clover too.
And a horseshoe.

35:39.551 --> 35:42.349
Say, how do rabbits
get to be born?

35:43.455 --> 35:46.356
Same way
elephants do.
Oh, sure.

35:46.424 --> 35:49.086
How come you
never came over
to visit me before?

35:49.160 --> 35:51.094
Didn't know you had such
a pretty mother, Arnie.

35:51.162 --> 35:55.189
If you think she's pretty,
you should see my slingshot.

35:55.266 --> 35:59.532
Hmm, perhaps I'll
come back tomorrow.
When's that?

35:59.604 --> 36:03.199
The day after today.
That's yesterday.
Today's tomorrow.

36:03.274 --> 36:07.938
It was.
When was tomorrow yesterday,
Mr. Marlow?

36:09.314 --> 36:12.249
Today.
Oh, sure.
Yesterday.

36:12.317 --> 36:15.218
<i>You'll never make sense</i>
<i>out of Arnie. He's got</i>
<i>his own timing.</i>

36:20.658 --> 36:22.751
Thank you.

36:22.827 --> 36:25.421
Lemonade, Arnie?
I already swiped
two glasses.

36:25.497 --> 36:29.866
I would've given you
two glasses.
It's more fun swiped.

36:29.934 --> 36:32.630
Can I borrow your rabbit,
Mr. Marlow?
Sure, Arnie.

36:32.704 --> 36:34.638
What are you gonna
do with it?

36:34.706 --> 36:37.334
You never know
when a dead rabbit
might come in handy.

36:39.477 --> 36:42.742
It already got me
one frog.

36:46.684 --> 36:51.621
<i>Arnie! Where are you</i>
<i>going now?</i>
To make some more trades!

36:51.689 --> 36:54.920
Arnie, come home
in time for supper.
<i>I'll try.</i>

36:54.993 --> 36:57.518
<i>[Horn Honking]</i>
What's your given name?

36:57.595 --> 37:03.227
If you don't want to tell me,
just make one up.
Jennifer. Jennifer Rogers.

37:03.301 --> 37:09.001
Nice.
Um, who's the man
up on the path?

37:09.073 --> 37:12.304
What man?
You know, Harry,
the dead man.

37:12.377 --> 37:17.371
Oh, him.
That's my husband.

37:17.448 --> 37:19.382
Your husband's
dead then?

37:22.720 --> 37:25.086
Is your lemonade
sweet enough?
Seems to be.

37:25.156 --> 37:29.855
I like it tart.
Harry is
Arnie's father then?

37:30.995 --> 37:33.190
No, Arnie's
father's dead.
So is Harry.

37:35.099 --> 37:38.000
Thank goodness.
He was too good
to live.

37:38.069 --> 37:40.902
From his looks,
he didn't appear to me
to be the kind who was too good.

37:40.972 --> 37:43.497
Well, he was.
Horribly good.

37:43.575 --> 37:48.069
I like your mouth too,
especially when
you say good.

37:51.282 --> 37:55.048
Will you have
some more lemonade?
Maybe later. Thanks.

37:55.119 --> 37:57.053
Where'd Arnie get
the rabbit?

37:58.590 --> 38:01.821
He found it. I think
Capt. Wiles shot it.

38:02.193 --> 38:06.186
I'd like to hear more
of your life story,
if you don't mind.

38:06.264 --> 38:08.198
You see, we don't know
quite what to do with Harry.

38:08.266 --> 38:10.427
<i>Thought you might have</i>
<i>some suggestions.</i>

38:10.501 --> 38:12.867
Hmm. You can stuff him
for all I care.

38:12.937 --> 38:15.963
<i>Stuffhim and put him</i>
<i>in a glass case,</i>

38:16.040 --> 38:18.907
only I'd suggest
frosted glass.

38:20.612 --> 38:23.513
What did he do to you,
besides marry you?

38:25.783 --> 38:30.220
Look, I've wanted to explain
about Harry a lot of times,

38:30.288 --> 38:35.555
<i>[Church Bells Ringing]</i>
But nobody would understand,
least of all Harry.

38:37.195 --> 38:42.132
But you-
You've got an artistic mind.
You can see the finer things.

38:42.200 --> 38:45.260
When I'm lucky.
Go on.
Tell me everything.

38:45.336 --> 38:48.931
Let it all out.

38:49.007 --> 38:52.534
It was a long time ago
and I was in love.

38:52.610 --> 38:55.135
I was too much
in love.
What was his name?

38:55.213 --> 38:57.147
Robert.

38:57.215 --> 39:00.241
We'd agreed to overlook
each other's families
and everything and get married.

39:00.318 --> 39:02.252
Did you?
Oh, yes.

39:04.522 --> 39:08.322
And then Robert
got killed.
Oh?

39:08.393 --> 39:12.454
I was heartbroken
for six weeks.

39:12.530 --> 39:15.499
Then I discovered
little Arnie
was on the way.

39:15.566 --> 39:18.967
Must have been a shock.
Well, that's where
Harry came in.

39:19.037 --> 39:23.701
Harry the handsome hero.
Harry the saint.

39:23.775 --> 39:26.676
Harry the good.
I didn't catch
his last name.

39:26.744 --> 39:29.679
Harry Worp,
Robert's brother-
his older brother.

39:29.747 --> 39:31.681
And he fell in love
with you?

39:31.749 --> 39:34.741
If he'd have fallen
in love with me,
I wouldn't have minded.

39:34.819 --> 39:38.346
He wanted to marry me
because he was Robert's brother
and felt noble.

39:38.423 --> 39:40.948
But you thought he was
in love with you?

39:41.025 --> 39:44.859
And I decided to let him
love me because of Arnie.

39:44.929 --> 39:47.591
It was on
my second wedding night
that I learned the truth.

39:49.567 --> 39:52.263
You didn't learn
on your first?

39:52.336 --> 39:57.603
<i>[Dog Barking]</i>
This was a terrible truth-

39:57.675 --> 40:01.042
the truth about Harry.
<i>Just what happened?</i>

40:02.947 --> 40:06.439
- How old are you,
Mr. Marlow?
- About thirty.

40:09.887 --> 40:13.482
This is what happened.

40:13.558 --> 40:18.325
I was in the hotel room alone.
I put on my best nightie.

40:18.396 --> 40:20.864
- You understand?
- Perfectly.

40:22.734 --> 40:24.759
Although I had
no true feeling for Harry,

40:24.836 --> 40:29.034
I had worked myself
into a certain enthusiasm
because I thought he loved me.

40:29.107 --> 40:31.041
<i>Must have been</i>
<i>hard work.</i>

40:32.443 --> 40:35.207
There was a full moon,
and I sat by the window...

40:35.279 --> 40:38.305
because I thought it would
show off my new nightie
to advantage.

40:38.382 --> 40:44.048
- Naturally.
- I don't know why
I'm telling you all this.

40:44.122 --> 40:46.488
You a perfect stranger too.
I'm not boring you,
am I?

40:47.959 --> 40:49.893
No. No.
Not at all.

40:51.629 --> 40:54.689
How about some
more lemonade?
Uh, soon. Soon.

40:56.601 --> 41:00.560
Oh, where was I?
You were sitting by the window
because there was a full moon,

41:00.638 --> 41:03.232
and you'd worked yourself up
to a certain enthusiasm.

41:03.307 --> 41:06.572
I said all that?

41:06.644 --> 41:09.807
<i>Uh, when does</i>
<i>Harry come in?</i>

41:09.881 --> 41:12.782
He doesn't.
He never came in.

41:12.850 --> 41:17.014
He called
the following morning.
<i>The following morning?</i>

41:17.088 --> 41:20.182
In the hotel lobby
the night before,
he had bought a magazine.

41:20.258 --> 41:22.351
- His horoscope was
in it.
- Bad?

41:22.426 --> 41:25.725
It said-
He was a Taurus.

41:25.797 --> 41:28.789
It said, " Don't start
any new project that day.

41:28.866 --> 41:31.232
It could never
be finished."

41:31.302 --> 41:35.568
<i>And what did you do?</i>
I left him on the spot,
and went home to Mother's.

41:35.640 --> 41:39.838
- The end.
- What a poignant story.

41:39.911 --> 41:44.439
I knew you'd understand.
Nobody else does.
Not even Mother?

41:44.515 --> 41:47.348
Well, she thought
I should live with him,
but I wouldn't.

41:47.418 --> 41:50.979
He pestered me to go back,
but I always refused.

41:51.055 --> 41:54.513
Well, suppose some night
I wanted him to do something...

41:54.592 --> 41:57.254
like the dishes,
for example.

41:57.328 --> 41:59.387
His horoscope just
wouldn't let him.

41:59.463 --> 42:04.298
You're absolutely right.
There are some things I just
don't like to do by myself.

42:04.368 --> 42:07.963
And no one with any
true understanding
would blame you for it.

42:09.907 --> 42:13.968
As soon as Arnie was born,
I moved away to where I thought
Harry could never find me.

42:14.045 --> 42:16.639
I changed my name and-

42:16.714 --> 42:19.649
But he
was persistent?

42:19.717 --> 42:22.117
This morning there was
a knock on the door.

42:22.186 --> 42:24.984
Before I opened it,
I knew he was standing
on the other side.

42:25.056 --> 42:30.517
What did he want?
Me! He wanted me
because I was his wife.

42:30.595 --> 42:34.531
He wanted me because,
as he put it, he suddenly
felt some basic urge:

42:34.599 --> 42:36.590
Loneliness.
What'd you feel?

42:36.667 --> 42:40.933
I felt sick.
Did you see his mustache
and his wavy hair?

42:41.005 --> 42:42.939
<i>Yeah, but when</i>
<i>I saw him,</i>
<i>he was dead.</i>

42:43.007 --> 42:46.636
Yeah, he looked exactly
the same when he was alive,
except he was vertical.

42:46.711 --> 42:49.737
<i>So he entered.</i>
<i>What'd you say?</i>
Nothing.

42:49.814 --> 42:52.339
I hit him over the head
with a milk bottle
and knocked him silly.

42:52.416 --> 42:57.149
- Silly?
- Bats. Tappy.

42:57.221 --> 43:00.349
He went staggering up
towards the woods saying
he was gonna find his wife...

43:00.424 --> 43:02.289
and drag her home
if it killed him.

43:02.360 --> 43:04.487
Apparently it did.

43:07.365 --> 43:10.562
<i>[Horn Honking]</i>
Have some more lemonade.

43:51.976 --> 43:55.503
Why, Capt. Wiles.
What a surprise.

43:55.579 --> 43:58.013
But you invited me,
Miss Gravely.

43:58.082 --> 44:00.949
At least that's how
I remember it.
Of course I did, Captain.

44:01.018 --> 44:03.953
But somehow,
it's still a surprise.

44:04.021 --> 44:07.889
Oh, yes.
You certainly know how
to make a man feel wanted.

44:07.959 --> 44:09.984
Won't you
come in, Captain?

44:10.061 --> 44:14.020
Oh, thank you.
I've-I've looked
forward to it.

44:30.081 --> 44:33.141
Takes a real cook to make
a good blueberry muffin-

44:33.217 --> 44:35.151
to keep the blueberries
from sitting on the bottom.

44:35.219 --> 44:38.655
High-bush blueberries.
That's the secret.

44:38.723 --> 44:43.854
I picked 'em up
near where you shot
that unfortunate man.

44:49.000 --> 44:51.594
A real handsome man's cup.

44:52.670 --> 44:55.264
It's been in
the family for years.

44:55.339 --> 44:58.137
My father always used it
up until he died.

45:01.979 --> 45:05.107
I trust he died peacefully-
slipped away in the night.

45:05.182 --> 45:08.083
He was caught
in a threshing machine.

45:11.155 --> 45:14.352
Hope I haven't
distressed you, Captain.
Oh, not at all, Miss Gravely.

45:14.425 --> 45:18.452
Not at all.
I'm used to looking
on the rough side of things.

45:18.529 --> 45:20.759
I am man who's
faced death many times.

45:21.866 --> 45:25.324
- Rather recently too.
- Yeah.

45:30.374 --> 45:34.003
- Arnie. What are you
carrying there?
- A rabbit.

45:34.078 --> 45:36.273
<i>[Captain]</i>
<i>A rabbit?</i>

45:38.115 --> 45:41.346
- What do you call it?
- Dead. It ain't mine.

45:41.419 --> 45:44.946
Well, whose is it?
Yours. You shot it
with your gun.

45:45.022 --> 45:47.047
You must've
killed it today.

45:47.124 --> 45:49.251
- It should make
a nice stew for ya.
- A rabbit!

45:49.326 --> 45:52.193
I finally killed a rabbit!
Where did you find it?

45:52.263 --> 45:54.197
In the blueberry muffins.

45:54.265 --> 45:57.530
- What?
- Out in the woods.

45:57.601 --> 46:01.298
Oh, here you are.
One muffin for one rabbit.
Fair enough?

46:01.372 --> 46:03.306
That was
a two-muffin rabbit.

46:03.374 --> 46:05.308
<i>[Chuckles]</i>

46:05.376 --> 46:07.867
- I gotta go now.
- Oh.

46:13.484 --> 46:16.681
[Sighs]

46:16.754 --> 46:18.688
Hmm.

46:20.458 --> 46:25.259
It's, uh, certainly
a nice afternoon,
Miss Gravely.

46:25.329 --> 46:28.230
Isn't it?
Mmm.

46:28.299 --> 46:32.292
Yes, and you're-
You're a nice woman.

46:32.369 --> 46:35.861
And I think
you're awfully nice,
Capt. Wiles.

46:35.940 --> 46:41.242
Um, um. Let's get back
to our little problem:
Harry.

46:41.312 --> 46:44.611
What's going to become of him?
Oh, now, now.
Don't you worry about Harry.

46:44.682 --> 46:46.980
He'll be comfortably
underground before nightfall.

46:47.051 --> 46:51.750
All that digging and work.
Couldn't you just...

46:51.822 --> 46:54.757
let him slide off
the end of your boat pier
into the pond?

46:57.027 --> 47:00.087
And have him
pop up like a cork?
No, sir.

47:00.164 --> 47:02.564
Nobody ever popped up
from under four feet of ground.

47:02.633 --> 47:06.296
<i>No. Besides, they'll be</i>
<i>cutting ice there this winter.</i>

47:06.370 --> 47:09.305
Now wouldn't it be
a nice thing if they were
cutting blocks of ice and-

47:09.373 --> 47:12.240
Never mind, Captain.
You're right.

47:14.178 --> 47:16.510
Yes. Underground is
the best place
for Harry.

47:42.940 --> 47:46.467
He seems comfortable, Sam,
very comfortable and snug.

47:46.544 --> 47:49.069
We better find a place
and get it dug
and the sooner the better.

47:49.146 --> 47:51.944
If what you're telling me
about Mrs. Rogers
and her husband is right,

47:52.016 --> 47:53.984
I agree with you,
Sammy.

47:54.051 --> 47:56.519
Well, let's
find a place.

47:56.587 --> 47:58.521
No use making
hard work out of it.

47:58.589 --> 48:00.523
We need a place
where the earth is soft.

48:00.591 --> 48:04.186
Yeah, and a place where
the whole town won't
stumble over us as we work.

48:04.261 --> 48:08.197
Mmm. A place with
a certain character
and attractiveness.

48:08.265 --> 48:11.564
Facing west so that
Harry can watch
the setting sun.

48:11.635 --> 48:14.763
Where it'll be cozy
in winter.
And cool in the summer.

48:14.838 --> 48:18.433
You know,
I'm half envying Harry.

48:18.509 --> 48:21.501
It wouldn't take
much longer to dig it
twice as wide.

48:21.579 --> 48:24.377
Well, thanks for
your kindness,
but some other time.

48:29.987 --> 48:32.888
Here. This looks like
a good place.
Ah.

48:32.957 --> 48:35.221
You're a lucky fellow,
Harry Worp.

48:40.864 --> 48:43.560
Come on, Captain.
Off with your coat.
What, me?

48:43.634 --> 48:45.568
Certainly you.
It's your body,
isn't it?

48:45.636 --> 48:47.831
Oh, I'm not much
of a hand at grave digging.

48:47.905 --> 48:51.136
You should've thought
of that before you went
hunting this morning.

48:51.208 --> 48:54.268
<i>[Car Engine Rewing]</i>

48:54.345 --> 48:57.610
Calvin Wiggs.
What'll we do now?

48:57.681 --> 48:59.979
Think up
the best story
he's ever heard.

49:03.254 --> 49:05.313
<i>[Car Engine Recedes]</i>

49:24.642 --> 49:28.408
Lay down
your shovel, Sam.
What's the trouble?

49:28.479 --> 49:33.473
- I'm dead beat.
- Good. I was dead beat
ten minutes ago.

49:33.550 --> 49:36.144
I wanted to keep digging
until you gave up.

49:42.726 --> 49:45.593
Gives me the creeps.
Yeah?

49:45.663 --> 49:48.359
Come on.
Let's get Harry
and pop him in.

49:55.172 --> 49:57.106
With hasty reverence.

50:05.015 --> 50:08.610
Would you like to say
a few words, Captain?
That I would.

50:08.686 --> 50:12.053
Harry Worp, don't
ever show your face
around here again!

50:12.122 --> 50:16.684
<i>[Car Approaching]</i>

50:16.760 --> 50:19.456
Let's finish this job
and get out of here.

50:19.530 --> 50:23.398
Captain,
I think Calvin Wiggs
is looking for something.

50:23.467 --> 50:25.401
Do you suppose he knows
that Harry Worp
came up here?

50:25.469 --> 50:28.666
Sammy, that's as horrible
a thought as you've ever had.

50:28.739 --> 50:31.003
And that he wonders
what happened to Harry
or where he is?

50:31.075 --> 50:35.842
My only answer is
to keep on scraping,
and fast.

50:35.913 --> 50:39.849
You know if, if you must
kill things from now on,
I wish you'd stick to rabbits.

50:39.917 --> 50:42.818
The body's smaller.
Rabbits! I didn't tell you,
did I, Sammy?

50:42.886 --> 50:47.380
I shot a rabbit today!
Don't shout.
I know you did.

50:47.458 --> 50:50.359
I was up atJennifer Rogers'
when Arnie showed me
the rabbit.

50:50.427 --> 50:54.124
Jennifer, eh?
Didn't waste
much time, did you?

50:54.198 --> 50:56.132
Well, I don't
blame you, Sammy.

50:56.200 --> 50:58.794
A very nice widow
she'll make. Very nice.

50:58.869 --> 51:01.099
Let's discuss her
when we've finished
with Harry, huh?

51:01.171 --> 51:03.901
No need to get huffy.
I don't want to talk
about your affairs.

51:03.974 --> 51:06.374
I've got affairs
of my own.

51:06.443 --> 51:08.377
You mean my protege?

51:08.445 --> 51:10.709
Come again?
Miss Gravely.

51:10.781 --> 51:14.012
The lady that I renovated
down at Mrs. Wiggs'
this afternoon.

51:14.084 --> 51:16.985
A most remarkable
reversion to femininity.

51:17.054 --> 51:19.454
I don't quite get you,
Sammy boy.

51:19.523 --> 51:22.048
She came into the Emporium
in rather high excitement.

51:22.126 --> 51:25.323
Wanted a new cup and saucer,
lots of other things.

51:25.396 --> 51:29.127
<i>I gave her a new makeup</i>
<i>and hairdo.</i>

51:29.199 --> 51:31.531
Don't tell me
you didn't notice.

51:31.602 --> 51:34.730
She's a very nice lady,
Sam. Very nice.

51:34.805 --> 51:38.400
We're all nice. I don't see
how anyone could help
but like us.

51:38.475 --> 51:40.670
[Sighs]
That's just how I feel today.

51:40.744 --> 51:43.110
I don't know whether I've
grown rose-colored glasses
or if-

51:43.180 --> 51:45.114
Or, uh,
if you're in love?

51:45.182 --> 51:47.309
Aha!
[Chuckling]

51:47.384 --> 51:50.512
There's nothing like
finding yourself in love.

51:50.587 --> 51:53.078
No, it adds zest
to your work.

51:53.157 --> 51:55.557
Zest! Zest!

51:55.626 --> 51:58.823
I think I've had
enough zest for a while.

51:58.896 --> 52:02.923
Let's sit down
and rest, huh?
<i>Why not? We've earned it.</i>

52:06.103 --> 52:11.006
Tell me, Sam,
what did Jennifer
think of my shooting?

52:11.074 --> 52:13.008
You mean Mrs. Rogers?
Oh, I think by now...

52:13.076 --> 52:15.340
I'm entitled to be
on a first-name basis
with her.

52:15.412 --> 52:18.210
After all, I brought her
a happy release
with one bullet.

52:18.282 --> 52:21.251
One bullet? How 'bout
that "No Shooting" sign
that I found?

52:21.318 --> 52:24.287
Well, that. One bullet
for the "No Shooting" sign,

52:24.354 --> 52:27.255
one for the beer can
and one for Harry.

52:27.324 --> 52:30.020
How about the rabbit?
And one for the ra-

52:34.965 --> 52:36.933
What's the matter?

52:37.000 --> 52:38.934
<i>What's wrong?</i>
<i>What's bitten you?</i>

52:39.002 --> 52:41.596
I only fired three bullets.
Three!

52:41.672 --> 52:44.334
One for the shooting sign,
one for the beer can-

52:44.408 --> 52:46.638
And one for the little man
who's lying in the grave.

52:46.710 --> 52:49.338
No, Sammy, no.
That's just it.
One for the rabbit.

52:49.413 --> 52:51.813
If I shot the rabbit,
I didn't shoot Harry.

52:51.882 --> 52:54.851
Oh, Sammy boy, what have you
tried to make me do?

52:54.918 --> 52:56.852
Tried to make
a murderer out of me.

52:59.022 --> 53:03.186
Well, don't sit there.
Help me!
You helped bury him.

53:03.260 --> 53:05.626
Even if you didn't kill him,
why go digging him up...

53:05.696 --> 53:07.789
now that he's
so beautifully planted?

53:07.865 --> 53:10.459
<i>I've promised Jennifer</i>
<i>that we'd bury him.</i>

53:10.534 --> 53:13.526
<i>Keep my word,</i>
<i>he should stay buried.</i>

53:13.604 --> 53:16.437
Besides whether
you killed him or not,
you've incriminated yourself.

53:16.507 --> 53:20.841
<i>You'll have more of a job</i>
<i>explaining away a body</i>
<i>you didn't kill and buried...</i>

53:20.911 --> 53:23.846
than a body that you killed
accidentally and buried.

53:23.914 --> 53:26.815
Right, Captain?

53:30.454 --> 53:32.888
You're not supposed
to bury bodies
whenever you find them.

53:32.956 --> 53:34.890
It makes people suspicious.

53:34.958 --> 53:37.449
Supposed to tell the police
or advertise or something.

53:37.528 --> 53:41.487
Oh, Sammy, you don't understand.
You don't comprehend one bit.

53:41.565 --> 53:44.898
You wouldn't like me to go
through my life not knowing if
I killed him or not, would you?

53:47.571 --> 53:49.732
Very inconsistent.

53:49.806 --> 53:51.831
First you tell me
you've got no conscience.

53:51.909 --> 53:54.571
Now you talk about something
that sounds remarkably
like a conscience.

53:54.645 --> 53:56.636
Oh, Sammy, come on.
Help me.

53:56.713 --> 53:59.841
I don't care if I killed him
or not, for all that matters.

53:59.917 --> 54:04.877
But I'll get the shakes
whenever I see a policeman,
and it's no good saying I won't.

54:04.955 --> 54:06.923
All right.

54:06.990 --> 54:10.619
If I had my choice,
I'd rather be thought
a murderer than proved one.

54:10.694 --> 54:14.960
With two of us digging,
we'll have Harry out of here
in nothing flat.

54:22.873 --> 54:24.864
Can't see much from here.

54:24.942 --> 54:26.967
I'd better get in down there
and look at him.

54:27.044 --> 54:30.707
Let me do the honors.
All right.
You've got good eyes.

54:32.649 --> 54:35.812
Hey. That isn't
a bullet wound.

54:35.886 --> 54:37.945
"Isn't
a bullet wound"?
No.

54:38.021 --> 54:39.955
What d'ya know?

54:40.023 --> 54:42.787
That's what they call a blow
with a blunt instrument.

54:42.859 --> 54:45.555
Huh? What are you
thinking, Sammy?

54:47.331 --> 54:51.392
I think, Capt. Wiles,
we're tangled up
in a murder.

54:51.468 --> 54:55.370
Murder. If it's murder,
who done it?

54:55.439 --> 54:59.136
- Who "did" it?
- That's what I say:
Who done it?

54:59.209 --> 55:02.736
Apart from Jennifer Rogers,
who else'd want to kill him?

55:04.147 --> 55:06.081
"Apart from Jennifer"?

55:06.149 --> 55:08.083
<i>Yeah. Do you think</i>
<i>that she would-</i>

55:08.151 --> 55:10.085
Oh, it's ridiculous.

55:10.153 --> 55:12.678
You said she was
surprised to see the body
when she came up here.

55:12.756 --> 55:15.316
<i>You said she hit him</i>
<i>on the head.</i>

55:15.392 --> 55:17.883
Coming home
from Madagascar once,
we had a fireman on board...

55:17.961 --> 55:20.725
who hit his head
on a brick wall
and died two days later.

55:20.797 --> 55:23.231
Where could he find
a brick wall on board a ship?

55:23.300 --> 55:26.292
That's what we always wondered.

55:27.671 --> 55:31.300
[Sighs]
Couldn't have been
Jennifer. No.

55:31.375 --> 55:33.741
Besides, what's it matter
who did it?

55:33.810 --> 55:36.244
It'll be better for all of us
if he's buried
and out of the way.

55:36.313 --> 55:40.181
Nothing doing.
I'm not burying
someone else's bad habits.

55:40.250 --> 55:42.775
Hmm? Suppose
it was Miss Gravely?

55:42.853 --> 55:46.152
What?
[Laughing]

55:46.223 --> 55:48.714
No, it's not as funny
as all that.

55:48.792 --> 55:51.158
You said yourself she wasn't
particularly startled...

55:51.228 --> 55:53.162
to see you dragging Harry
up the path.

55:53.230 --> 55:56.324
You artists have got
no idea of etiquette.

55:56.400 --> 55:58.891
Miss Gravely is a lady
of gentle habits
and upbringing.

55:58.969 --> 56:01.938
A lady to hide her feelings.
If I hadn't been holding Harry
by the ankles,

56:02.005 --> 56:04.132
I don't suppose she'd have
mentioned him at all.

56:04.207 --> 56:07.472
- Really?
- Nah! When she said,

56:07.544 --> 56:10.035
"What seems to be the trouble,
Captain?"

56:10.113 --> 56:12.547
It was nothing more
than a pleasantry,
so to speak.

56:12.616 --> 56:16.677
Like, "Nice day, isn't it?"
"I'm sure, yes."

56:16.753 --> 56:18.687
Or something like that.

56:18.755 --> 56:21.155
<i>Going to help me</i>
<i>bury him again?</i>

56:21.224 --> 56:24.887
Um- I don't know.

56:24.961 --> 56:28.362
'Course, it might have been
Dr. Greenbow or the tramp or-

56:28.432 --> 56:32.664
<i>OrJennifer?</i>
I told you it couldn't-

56:32.736 --> 56:36.137
Well, no point in arguing
about it. Let's get rid of him.

56:38.175 --> 56:43.078
All right. You've helped me
in my hour of need. I guess
it's up to me to help you.

56:43.146 --> 56:45.944
We'll file Harry away
once and for all.
Yeah.

56:46.016 --> 56:47.950
No more nonsense
about it.

57:13.810 --> 57:16.608
Come aboard, Miss Gravely,
come aboard.

57:16.680 --> 57:19.376
It's just an old salt's
snug anchorage.

57:19.449 --> 57:23.180
Small,
not palatial like yours.
But homely, very home-

57:39.136 --> 57:41.127
Won't you sit down,
Miss Gravely?

57:41.204 --> 57:43.138
Thank you.

57:45.342 --> 57:50.279
It's funny, you know.
Funny how we got to be
so friendly in one afternoon.

57:50.347 --> 57:54.545
I knew you weren't as prim
and starchy as they made out.

57:54.618 --> 57:56.609
<i>[Chuckling]</i>
<i>Not by a long shot.</i>

57:56.686 --> 57:58.620
Really?
<i>No.</i>

57:58.688 --> 58:01.816
I'm a man who can recognize
the human qualities
in a woman.

58:01.892 --> 58:04.292
When I first saw you
down where Harry was-

58:04.361 --> 58:06.659
Capt. Wiles.
<i>Yes, ma'am?</i>

58:06.730 --> 58:09.927
Before you make
your kind thoughts
known to me, I...

58:10.000 --> 58:13.697
should like to
offer you some explanation
of my sudden invitation...

58:13.770 --> 58:16.500
to coffee and blueberry muffins
this afternoon...

58:16.573 --> 58:19.736
and my- and my sitting
with you here now.

58:19.810 --> 58:21.971
No, ma'am, you don't
have to explain anything.

58:22.045 --> 58:26.141
You came to my aid
at a moment of crisis,
for which I'm truly grateful.

58:26.216 --> 58:30.516
Thank you, but it's just
that I owe you some reason.

58:30.587 --> 58:33.021
No, no, no.
I won't hear a word of it.

58:33.089 --> 58:36.456
You saw the predicament
I was in with that body
on my hands and all,

58:36.526 --> 58:40.189
and you shut your eyes to it
in a most sporting fashion,
if I may say so.

58:40.263 --> 58:42.595
Capt. Wiles.
<i>Yes, ma'am?</i>

58:42.666 --> 58:46.659
I'm trying to tell you that
the reason I asked you to
coffee and blueberry muffins...

58:46.736 --> 58:49.170
was because... I felt-

58:49.239 --> 58:51.434
Sympathy.
<i>Gratitude.</i>

58:51.508 --> 58:54.443
Gra- But I'm the one
who should be grateful.

58:54.511 --> 58:59.448
No, I was grateful.
L- I am grateful.

58:59.516 --> 59:03.646
I'm grateful to you
for burying my body.

59:08.925 --> 59:10.859
<i>Your</i> body?

59:10.927 --> 59:13.521
The man you
thought you killed...

59:13.597 --> 59:18.000
was the man I hit over the head
with the leather heel
of my hiking shoe.

59:18.068 --> 59:20.332
You?

59:20.403 --> 59:23.634
- And with a metal cleat
on the end of it.
- But why?

59:25.542 --> 59:27.476
He annoyed me.

59:27.544 --> 59:30.138
I was walking towards home
when he...

59:30.213 --> 59:32.738
suddenly came at me
with a wild look in his eye...

59:32.816 --> 59:35.979
and insisted...
we were married.

59:36.052 --> 59:38.350
Oh, then you'd known
each other before.

59:38.421 --> 59:41.481
Believe it or not, I had never
seen him before in my life,

59:41.558 --> 59:45.494
and... if I ever had, I never
would have married <i>him.</i>

59:45.562 --> 59:48.053
He must have mistaken you
for someone else.

59:48.131 --> 59:52.090
No, he definitely...
pulled me into the bushes.

59:52.168 --> 59:54.261
Yes?

59:54.337 --> 59:58.535
- I came out again.
- Go on.

59:58.608 --> 01:00:02.169
He pulled me back.

01:00:02.245 --> 01:00:04.179
Twice.

01:00:04.247 --> 01:00:07.774
He swore at me-
horrible, masculine sounds.

01:00:07.851 --> 01:00:09.785
I didn't understand them,
of course.

01:00:09.853 --> 01:00:12.845
Of course you didn't.

01:00:12.923 --> 01:00:15.448
- We fought.
- Then what?

01:00:16.893 --> 01:00:21.853
I won. My shoe had come off
in the struggle, and I hit him.

01:00:21.932 --> 01:00:25.459
I hit him as hard
as ever I could.

01:00:28.638 --> 01:00:30.572
You killed him.

01:00:32.042 --> 01:00:36.206
I must have done it.
I was annoyed, Captain.

01:00:37.347 --> 01:00:39.542
<i>Very annoyed.</i>
Naturally.

01:00:39.616 --> 01:00:42.881
I don't think I've
ever been so annoyed.

01:00:42.953 --> 01:00:47.822
Consequently, I, I didn't
realize my own capabilities.

01:00:47.891 --> 01:00:51.258
Whew! Seems to me...

01:00:51.328 --> 01:00:54.320
Mrs. Rogers knocked him silly,
and you finished him off.

01:00:54.397 --> 01:00:57.389
Why should Mrs. Rogers
knock him silly?

01:00:57.467 --> 01:00:59.799
<i>She was really his wife.</i>

01:00:59.869 --> 01:01:04.465
Poor woman.
I thought she had better taste.

01:01:06.142 --> 01:01:08.076
You know, Captain,

01:01:08.144 --> 01:01:12.137
when I ran away I decided
I would never tell a soul
what happened.

01:01:12.215 --> 01:01:14.843
<i>Then I met you,</i>
<i>and I thought...</i>

01:01:14.918 --> 01:01:20.254
how convenient it was
that you should think
that you had shot him.

01:01:20.323 --> 01:01:23.690
- You must forgive me
for thinking that.
- Only natural.

01:01:23.760 --> 01:01:28.390
That's why I felt- I still
feel under an obligation to you.

01:01:28.465 --> 01:01:31.366
<i>Oh, not at all.</i>
<i>Let's forget it.</i>

01:01:31.434 --> 01:01:35.302
No, we mustn't do that.
It would hardly be fair to you-

01:01:35.372 --> 01:01:40.366
<i>I mean, for you to go through</i>
<i>life knowing that you had buried</i>
<i>a man you didn't kill.</i>

01:01:40.443 --> 01:01:42.934
You would have my crime
on your conscience.

01:01:43.013 --> 01:01:45.948
It's a pleasure,
[Hiccups]
I'm sure.

01:01:46.016 --> 01:01:48.143
But no.

01:01:48.218 --> 01:01:52.154
Now I realize that Harry man
was out of his mind, and...

01:01:52.222 --> 01:01:54.884
my action was justifiable,

01:01:54.958 --> 01:01:57.950
there's no reason
we shouldn't let
the authorities know about it.

01:01:58.028 --> 01:02:01.589
The authorities?
<i>Then everything will be</i>
<i>cleared up nicely.</i>

01:02:01.664 --> 01:02:04.497
<i>I'm sure Calvin Wiggs</i>
<i>and the police...</i>

01:02:04.567 --> 01:02:07.127
<i>won't make a fuss about it</i>
<i>when we explain.</i>

01:02:07.203 --> 01:02:10.502
<i>Perhaps it needn't get</i>
<i>into the papers at all.</i>
Don't you believe it, ma'am.

01:02:10.573 --> 01:02:12.939
They love it, the papers,
this kind of thing.

01:02:13.009 --> 01:02:15.500
Murder and passion.

01:02:15.578 --> 01:02:18.206
You let Harry be.
Just forget it ever happened,

01:02:18.281 --> 01:02:22.115
the same as Sammy and me
and Jennifer Rogers
are going to do.

01:02:22.185 --> 01:02:26.815
Oh, but- but it
isn't your body.

01:02:26.890 --> 01:02:31.418
After all, I killed him,
so it's only fair that
I should have the say-so.

01:02:31.494 --> 01:02:33.621
Yes, but-
Well, in a way-
<i>Don't you agree?</i>

01:02:33.696 --> 01:02:37.223
I thought you would.
I tell you what, Captain.

01:02:40.270 --> 01:02:42.704
We'll go and
get a spade now.
But, ma'am-

01:02:42.772 --> 01:02:45.639
And after we've dug him up,
we'll go back to my place...

01:02:45.708 --> 01:02:48.176
and I'll make you
some hot chocolate.

01:03:28.852 --> 01:03:32.185
Arnie's so tired
he'll sleep all day
and half the night.

01:03:32.255 --> 01:03:34.917
I think you've got
a pretty house, Jennifer.

01:03:34.991 --> 01:03:38.290
It's the best I could do
on Robert's insurance.

01:03:38.361 --> 01:03:40.659
Sugar?
No, black, thanks.

01:03:51.241 --> 01:03:53.175
It's funny, but...

01:03:53.243 --> 01:03:56.679
I feel awful comfortable
with you, Sam.

01:03:58.948 --> 01:04:01.382
You know, I feel
the same way too.

01:04:01.518 --> 01:04:03.509
It's a good feeling,

01:04:03.586 --> 01:04:07.022
feeling comfortable with someone
who feels that way too.

01:04:10.994 --> 01:04:13.519
There is one thing
I feel uncomfortable about.

01:04:13.596 --> 01:04:16.963
Tell me what it is,
and I'll take care
of it for you.

01:04:17.033 --> 01:04:18.967
It's Harry?
What about Harry?

01:04:19.035 --> 01:04:21.799
Harry? Don't you
think about Harry.

01:04:21.871 --> 01:04:25.136
Harry's part of the earth.
He's with eternity,
the ages.

01:04:25.208 --> 01:04:27.438
Take my word for it.
Harry's ancient history.

01:04:27.510 --> 01:04:29.444
<i>[Knocking At Door]</i>

01:04:29.512 --> 01:04:31.707
Come in,
whoever it is.

01:04:35.185 --> 01:04:37.153
What happened?
[Sighs]

01:04:37.220 --> 01:04:39.711
Sam, I've got
Something to tell you.

01:04:39.789 --> 01:04:43.350
No, Captain, I have
something to tell him.

01:04:43.426 --> 01:04:45.860
Now who's
going to tell what?

01:04:45.929 --> 01:04:47.863
[Sighs]

01:04:47.931 --> 01:04:51.799
I killed Harry Worp
with the leather heel
of my hiking shoe.

01:04:54.938 --> 01:04:58.237
- So it was you.
- We're on our way
to get Calvin Wiggs,

01:04:58.308 --> 01:05:01.641
and have him call
the state police.
I keep
telling her there's no need.

01:05:01.711 --> 01:05:05.875
He's right and, uh,
besides, it'd be indecent.
Harry's dead and buried.

01:05:05.949 --> 01:05:08.179
Sam, I've got
something to tell you.

01:05:09.385 --> 01:05:11.319
You haven't
dug him up again.

01:05:11.387 --> 01:05:13.480
Well, l-

01:05:20.296 --> 01:05:22.696
<i>I insisted, Mr. Marlow.</i>

01:05:22.765 --> 01:05:25.131
Don't you understand?

01:05:25.201 --> 01:05:29.501
<i>You have nothing to fear.</i>
<i>It's my concern entirely.</i>

01:05:29.572 --> 01:05:33.872
As soon as Capt. Wiles told me
the full circumstances
of his being here,

01:05:33.943 --> 01:05:35.911
I knew there was
nothing for me to hide.

01:05:35.979 --> 01:05:38.140
You know all about Harry?

01:05:38.214 --> 01:05:40.614
I'm afraid I do,
Mrs. Rogers, and-

01:05:40.683 --> 01:05:44.483
and after all,
nobody could possibly gossip
about a lady and a maniac.

01:05:44.554 --> 01:05:46.488
You'd be surprised.

01:05:46.556 --> 01:05:49.423
You don't quite understand
what murder involves,
Miss Gravely.

01:05:49.492 --> 01:05:52.086
It'd be hours and hours
of questioning and photographs,

01:05:52.161 --> 01:05:55.153
and the whole of
your private life spread
indecently in the newspapers.

01:05:57.433 --> 01:06:00.664
What makes you think
my private life is indecent?

01:06:00.737 --> 01:06:03.900
I didn't mean that. I meant
that the way they pry
is indecent.

01:06:03.973 --> 01:06:08.637
They'll hound you to death.
There'll be newspapermen,
photographers, detectives.

01:06:08.711 --> 01:06:11.942
- I've made up my mind.
- She certainly has.

01:06:12.015 --> 01:06:14.813
<i>It was Capt. Wiles here</i>
<i>who persuaded me to call...</i>

01:06:14.884 --> 01:06:17.944
<i>and tell Mrs. Rogers</i>
<i>what I proposed to do.</i>

01:06:18.021 --> 01:06:22.117
After all, she is
most closely connected
with the business.

01:06:22.191 --> 01:06:25.024
What do you think about it,
Mrs. Rogers?

01:06:25.094 --> 01:06:28.086
I can't see why you're all
making such a fuss about Harry.

01:06:28.164 --> 01:06:31.759
If he was buried, I don't see
why you had to dig him up.

01:06:31.834 --> 01:06:35.099
But since you have,
I guess you'd better do
what you think best.

01:06:35.171 --> 01:06:38.629
I don't care what you do
with Harry, as long as you
don't bring him back to life.

01:06:40.310 --> 01:06:43.837
- I have a free hand, then.
- Free as a bird.

01:06:43.913 --> 01:06:46.347
As far as I'm concerned,
it's ancient history.

01:06:46.416 --> 01:06:48.577
Wait a minute, Jennifer.

01:06:48.651 --> 01:06:50.983
I think we've
forgotten something.

01:06:51.054 --> 01:06:54.148
Do you realize if this thing
comes out, that all the details
of your marriage...

01:06:54.223 --> 01:06:56.418
<i>will be public property?</i>

01:06:58.227 --> 01:07:03.028
- Oh.
- I must confess, I hadn't
thought of that, either.

01:07:03.099 --> 01:07:06.762
- Where'd you put Harry
this time?
- Over by the big oak tree.

01:07:06.836 --> 01:07:08.929
I'll get my shovel.

01:07:09.005 --> 01:07:11.667
I'm afraid I'm causing you
rather a lot of hard work.

01:07:11.741 --> 01:07:13.709
I'm sorry.
Not at all,
not at all.

01:07:13.776 --> 01:07:16.745
Well, let's all
go up there.

01:07:18.147 --> 01:07:21.207
You know, I've never been
to a homemade funeral before.

01:07:21.284 --> 01:07:24.811
[Chuckles]
I have.

01:07:24.887 --> 01:07:27.617
This is my third.

01:07:27.690 --> 01:07:30.022
All in one day.

01:07:30.093 --> 01:07:32.391
[Sighing]

01:07:32.462 --> 01:07:34.896
<i>[Clock Chiming]</i>

01:07:36.299 --> 01:07:39.735
<i>[Sam]</i>
<i>Well, let's</i>
<i>get it over with.</i>

01:07:39.802 --> 01:07:41.736
Yes.

01:07:53.816 --> 01:07:56.011
[Captain]
I think we ought to
cement it over.

01:07:56.085 --> 01:07:59.543
[Miss Gravely]
Next spring I'll set out
some blueberry bushes.

01:07:59.622 --> 01:08:02.352
[Captain]
Couldn't you make it
something else? Lilacs maybe?

01:08:02.425 --> 01:08:04.359
[Sam]
I think nature'll
take good care of it.

01:08:04.427 --> 01:08:08.386
How about a little service?
[Sam] I can't think
of anything to say.

01:08:08.464 --> 01:08:11.592
Besides, my arms ache.
[Jennifer]
It's too late to say prayers.

01:08:11.667 --> 01:08:15.000
Besides, wherever he was going,
he's there now.

01:08:15.071 --> 01:08:17.163
Bye, Harry.
I forgive you.

01:08:20.710 --> 01:08:25.807
<i>[Trumpeting]</i>

01:08:25.881 --> 01:08:28.316
[Captain]
Trumpets welcoming Harry.

01:08:28.384 --> 01:08:31.785
You didn't know Harry.
I'd like to paint you
like that, Jennifer.

01:08:31.854 --> 01:08:34.084
You look beautiful,
glistening in the moonlight.

01:08:34.157 --> 01:08:36.091
<i>[Trumpeting]</i>

01:08:36.158 --> 01:08:38.093
[Captain]
Sounds as if it's coming down
from near the village.

01:08:38.161 --> 01:08:40.095
[Miss Gravely]
I know what it is.

01:08:40.162 --> 01:08:42.154
It's the call
of the phantom stagecoach...

01:08:42.231 --> 01:08:46.634
that used to pass by here
each night 200 years ago.
Phantom coach?

01:08:46.702 --> 01:08:49.933
The old turnpike used to
run across those foothills
over there.

01:08:50.006 --> 01:08:52.839
[Sam]
Oh, to be a highwayman
on a night like this.

01:08:52.908 --> 01:08:55.173
[Jennifer]
Listen. Somebody's running.
<i>[Indistinct Shouting]</i>

01:08:55.243 --> 01:08:57.974
Horses?
If it's a horse,
it's learned how to shout.

01:08:58.046 --> 01:09:01.278
What's she saying?
We'll know in a minute.
She's coming this way.

01:09:01.317 --> 01:09:06.185
<i>Sam Marlow!</i>
It's Wiggy. Old Wiggy.

01:09:07.323 --> 01:09:12.350
Mr. Marlow!
Mr. Marlow!

01:09:12.428 --> 01:09:16.023
Wiggy, what on earth
do you want?
L- He-You-Wants-

01:09:16.098 --> 01:09:18.292
Catch your breath.
He's a millionaire.

01:09:18.367 --> 01:09:21.495
Who?
He wants to buy
your pictures, Mr. Marlow.

01:09:21.571 --> 01:09:23.801
Which pictures?
All of'em
and more besides.

01:09:23.872 --> 01:09:26.136
He says you're a genius.

01:09:26.209 --> 01:09:29.474
He's right, but it's hard
to believe he wants to buy
all my pictures.

01:09:29.545 --> 01:09:32.139
[Miss Gravely]
I'd be too curious to refuse
at least to talk to him.

01:09:32.215 --> 01:09:34.706
[Wiggy]
Don't turn down
a good chance.

01:09:34.783 --> 01:09:37.218
All right,
I'll talk to him.

01:09:39.087 --> 01:09:41.955
We're digging sassafras root.
[Wiggy] Sassafras tea's
mighty good for you.

01:09:42.024 --> 01:09:45.288
Mr. Wiggs always swore
it cured his arthritis
just before he died.

01:09:45.361 --> 01:09:47.295
[Captain]
How much does the millionaire
want to pay?

01:09:47.363 --> 01:09:52.265
I asked seven dollars for that
one looks like a lot of blobs
of color in a thunderstorm.

01:09:52.335 --> 01:09:54.462
[Sam] And?
Said he couldn't think of it.
Said they were priceless.

01:09:54.537 --> 01:09:57.665
[Captain]
Sounds like something
I painted in kindergarten.

01:09:57.740 --> 01:10:00.538
[Sam] I'll have you know
that picture's symbolic
of the beginning of the world.

01:10:00.610 --> 01:10:04.102
[Captain]
That's where I first heard
of the world, at kindergarten.

01:10:04.747 --> 01:10:08.945
Yes, and my friend here,
art critic for
the Modern Museum-

01:10:09.018 --> 01:10:12.215
Don't think I'm rude,
but it doesn't matter to me
what an art critic says.

01:10:12.288 --> 01:10:15.746
Is that so?
I know my paintings are good.

01:10:15.825 --> 01:10:19.261
He doesn't want them; you do.
So all that matters
is what you think.

01:10:19.328 --> 01:10:23.526
I think they are
works of genius,
and I want to buy them all.

01:10:25.134 --> 01:10:27.534
Too bad.
Why?

01:10:27.603 --> 01:10:31.266
Just decided I can't
sell them. Besides,
you couldn't afford them.

01:10:31.340 --> 01:10:33.331
Oh.

01:10:33.409 --> 01:10:36.344
Uh-
Money.

01:10:36.412 --> 01:10:40.371
Sammy. Don't be a fool.
Make him pay through the nose.

01:10:40.449 --> 01:10:43.441
Go ahead, Mr. Marlow.
Be reasonable.

01:10:43.519 --> 01:10:45.612
Be unreasonable,
if you want.

01:10:45.688 --> 01:10:47.622
What do you say?

01:10:50.893 --> 01:10:53.384
It's your genius.
It's up to you.

01:10:57.233 --> 01:11:00.566
All right then.
What do you like most
in the whole world?

01:11:02.805 --> 01:11:05.968
I don't know.
Strawberries, I guess.

01:11:07.009 --> 01:11:08.943
Strawberries.
Write that down.

01:11:09.011 --> 01:11:12.777
Two boxes of fresh strawberries,
first of each month,
in and out of season...

01:11:12.848 --> 01:11:14.782
<i>from now on.</i>

01:11:14.850 --> 01:11:17.250
<i>Well, it's simple.</i>
<i>What else?</i>

01:11:17.320 --> 01:11:19.481
What would Arnie like?

01:11:20.823 --> 01:11:22.757
A chemical set.

01:11:22.825 --> 01:11:26.317
<i>What kind?</i>
Whatever smells the worst.

01:11:26.395 --> 01:11:28.829
Got that?
Right.

01:11:28.898 --> 01:11:31.492
One smelly chemical set.

01:11:31.567 --> 01:11:33.660
Wiggy. Wiggy,
what would you like?

01:11:33.736 --> 01:11:36.466
Cash register.
Chromium plated.
One that rings a bell.

01:11:36.539 --> 01:11:39.007
<i>Got room for one?</i>
I'll find room.

01:11:39.075 --> 01:11:41.839
<i>Cash register.</i>
Chromium plated.
One that rings a bell?

01:11:41.911 --> 01:11:43.845
Check.

01:11:43.913 --> 01:11:46.882
Miss Gravely,
a beauty parlor,
fully equipped?

01:11:46.949 --> 01:11:49.179
What for?

01:11:49.251 --> 01:11:53.950
A hope chest... filled
with the things I should have
put in it and didn't.

01:11:54.023 --> 01:11:57.686
A hope chest,
full of hope.

01:11:57.760 --> 01:12:00.092
<i>Captain?</i>

01:12:00.162 --> 01:12:03.393
A good shotgun,
plenty of ammunition,

01:12:03.466 --> 01:12:08.768
some corduroy britches,
a plain shirt and a hunting cap,
a brown one.

01:12:10.072 --> 01:12:12.336
Davy Crockett-
the works.

01:12:12.408 --> 01:12:16.037
Well, that's it, I guess.
The paintings are yours.

01:12:16.112 --> 01:12:18.046
Yes, but what about you?

01:12:18.114 --> 01:12:20.674
Yes, Sam, you've gotta
ask for something.

01:12:20.750 --> 01:12:22.684
Well, let's see.

01:12:26.055 --> 01:12:28.888
That's it.

01:12:28.958 --> 01:12:31.586
- What's it?
- Pardon me.

01:12:36.532 --> 01:12:38.466
What do you think?

01:12:41.137 --> 01:12:44.231
Yes, I think that can be
easily arranged.

01:12:47.143 --> 01:12:49.304
Well.
That's it, then.

01:12:49.378 --> 01:12:52.347
I'll come back in the morning
for all these paintings.

01:12:52.415 --> 01:12:55.350
Mr. Marlow,
this has been a night...

01:12:55.418 --> 01:12:57.648
that I shall remember
the rest of my life.

01:12:57.720 --> 01:13:00.814
Come back again.
Have some more paintings
for you next month.

01:13:00.890 --> 01:13:03.984
And you'll have
a steady customer in me,

01:13:04.060 --> 01:13:06.654
even if you raise
your prices.

01:13:06.729 --> 01:13:08.788
Well, good night,
everyone.

01:13:08.864 --> 01:13:10.798
Good night.
<i>Good night.</i>

01:13:10.866 --> 01:13:12.925
All right, young man.
[Millionaire Clears Throat]

01:13:17.840 --> 01:13:20.172
<i>[Captain]</i>
<i>Congratulations, Sammy.</i>
<i>Good boy.</i>

01:13:20.242 --> 01:13:23.973
<i>Did I do the right thing?</i>
You did just
the right thing, Sam.

01:13:24.046 --> 01:13:27.311
<i>Good.</i>

01:13:27.383 --> 01:13:29.908
Because it's important to me
that you think so.

01:13:29.985 --> 01:13:31.919
Why?

01:13:31.987 --> 01:13:34.421
Because I love you.
I want to marry you.

01:13:36.625 --> 01:13:38.616
Oh!
[Chuckling]

01:13:42.298 --> 01:13:45.028
You want to marry me?
Um-hmm. Why not?

01:13:47.470 --> 01:13:50.439
Because- Because I just
got my freedom today.

01:13:50.506 --> 01:13:52.997
Easy come, easy go.

01:13:53.075 --> 01:13:55.942
Besides, if you married me,
you'd keep your freedom.

01:13:58.247 --> 01:14:00.772
You must be
practically unique, then.

01:14:00.850 --> 01:14:04.980
I respect freedom.
More than that,
I love freedom.

01:14:05.054 --> 01:14:08.148
We might be the only
free married couple
in the world.

01:14:11.994 --> 01:14:14.428
This is very sudden,
Sam.

01:14:18.634 --> 01:14:21.467
You'll have to give me
a little time
to think about it.

01:14:21.537 --> 01:14:25.473
Only fair. I'll give you
until we get back
to your house.

01:14:31.914 --> 01:14:35.441
- What's goin' on here
this time of night?
- <i>The most wonderful thing.</i>

01:14:35.518 --> 01:14:38.112
Mr. Marlow sold
all his paintings
to a millionaire.

01:14:38.187 --> 01:14:40.678
Got more'n I ever
figured he'd get.
Money?

01:14:40.756 --> 01:14:44.248
Well, not exactly money.

01:14:44.326 --> 01:14:47.227
I always knew they weren't
worth the space.

01:14:47.296 --> 01:14:50.629
I found these on a tramp
hangin' 'round here.

01:14:50.699 --> 01:14:54.032
<i>Said he found 'em.</i>
<i>On a... dead man.</i>

01:14:55.838 --> 01:14:58.033
<i>Took me to where</i>
<i>he said he found him, and...</i>

01:14:59.341 --> 01:15:01.275
I didn't see any body.

01:15:01.310 --> 01:15:04.302

<i>[Wiggy]</i>
<i>That's the state police number.</i>
Uh-huh.

01:15:10.386 --> 01:15:13.446
I think, uh, we'd
better get going.

01:15:13.522 --> 01:15:16.047
<i>Thank you, Mr. Marlow,</i>
<i>for the cash register.</i>

01:15:16.125 --> 01:15:18.059
It was a pleasure.
Good night.

01:15:18.127 --> 01:15:20.288
Good night. Good night.
<i>Good night.</i>

01:15:20.362 --> 01:15:22.296
Good night.

01:15:22.364 --> 01:15:24.332
Good night.
Good night, Captain.

01:15:27.136 --> 01:15:30.731
<i>[Door Closes]</i>
This is
Deputy Sheriff Calvin Wiggs.

01:15:30.806 --> 01:15:32.740
Yeah, I'll wait.

01:15:49.658 --> 01:15:52.752
Ma?

01:15:52.828 --> 01:15:56.696
- Yes?
- This picture
here on the floor.

01:15:56.765 --> 01:16:00.792
It's a new one.
He did it today,
but it isn't for sale.

01:16:00.870 --> 01:16:03.964
<i>Why not?</i>
You'll have to ask him that.

01:16:04.039 --> 01:16:07.668
He left it on his way
over toJennifer Rogers' house.

01:16:07.743 --> 01:16:10.678
<i>Guess he didn't have time</i>
<i>to take it home.</i>

01:16:12.781 --> 01:16:15.215
You suddenly
got interested in art?

01:16:16.352 --> 01:16:19.150
No.

01:16:19.221 --> 01:16:22.486
It's just that it matches
the description of-

01:16:22.558 --> 01:16:25.288
Oh, hello, Sergeant.

01:16:25.361 --> 01:16:27.295
Calvin Wiggs.

01:16:27.363 --> 01:16:30.025
Got something that might
interest you a little.

01:16:30.099 --> 01:16:34.195
It seems I picked up this tramp
with a pair of stolen shoes...

01:16:34.270 --> 01:16:36.738
and a wild story
about a corpse.

01:16:57.459 --> 01:17:00.553
What do you think?
Him walking in
with Harry Worp's shoes...

01:17:00.629 --> 01:17:03.757
in his hand and then
that phone call to the police.

01:17:03.832 --> 01:17:06.323
Don't know.
I may be wrong,

01:17:06.402 --> 01:17:08.461
but I don't think he's
tied us into it yet.

01:17:08.537 --> 01:17:10.835
Oh, the way
he looked at me.

01:17:10.906 --> 01:17:13.374
If he'd known anything,
he'd have kept us there.

01:17:13.442 --> 01:17:18.004
But modern police methods
are all psychological now,
Sammy. Psychological.

01:17:18.080 --> 01:17:22.881
They just wear you down
and wear you down until...

01:17:22.952 --> 01:17:25.921
you're almost grateful
to get into that gas chamber.

01:17:27.489 --> 01:17:32.324
The police'll probably
tell him, if the shoes fit,
to keep them.

01:17:32.394 --> 01:17:34.988
Oh, well.

01:17:44.940 --> 01:17:48.239
I've decided, Sam.
Decided what?

01:17:48.310 --> 01:17:50.244
I will marry you,

01:17:50.312 --> 01:17:52.746
if you haven't forgotten
about asking me.

01:17:54.817 --> 01:17:58.014
I'm- I'm very fond
of you and,

01:17:58.087 --> 01:18:00.487
I think you'd make
a good father for Arnie...

01:18:02.224 --> 01:18:06.558
and for some other reasons
best left unsaid.

01:18:07.863 --> 01:18:09.854
Marriage is the comfortable way
to spend the winter,

01:18:09.932 --> 01:18:13.925
<i>but right now we should be</i>
<i>working on some good story</i>
<i>to satisfy the state police...</i>

01:18:14.003 --> 01:18:16.938
<i>if they should turn up.</i>

01:18:17.006 --> 01:18:21.102
Would you believe it?
I'd almost forgotten
that proposal.

01:18:21.176 --> 01:18:24.737
I have witnesses, Sam.
Oh, I remember now.

01:18:24.813 --> 01:18:28.772
All right, you've
got yourself a husband.

01:18:28.851 --> 01:18:31.046
I think I'll kiss you now
to prove it.

01:18:38.827 --> 01:18:42.661
Lightly, Sam.
I have a very short fuse.

01:18:52.141 --> 01:18:54.701
What a pretty sight.

01:19:01.683 --> 01:19:05.483
Sam, what did you ask
the millionaire for?

01:19:08.490 --> 01:19:12.324
[No Audio]

01:19:12.394 --> 01:19:14.328
That's very practical.

01:19:18.734 --> 01:19:21.100
Congratulations, my dear.

01:19:21.170 --> 01:19:24.606
You're a lucky man, Sammy.
I think you'll both
be very happy.

01:19:24.673 --> 01:19:26.607
Thank you.
If I grumbled too much...

01:19:26.675 --> 01:19:30.338
at my share of the work
in burying Harry, I'm sorry.

01:19:30.412 --> 01:19:32.539
I can see now
it was well worth it.

01:19:32.614 --> 01:19:36.414
And if I can do
anything else-
Hold it, hold it, hold it.

01:19:40.122 --> 01:19:44.582
- What's wrong, Sam?
- Harry. We're not quite
finished with him yet.

01:19:44.660 --> 01:19:48.426
Sam, if anybody's through,
it's Harry. He's been
buried three times.

01:19:48.497 --> 01:19:50.897
Before we can get married,
you're gonna have to prove
that you're free.

01:19:50.966 --> 01:19:54.959
To prove you're free, you'll
have to prove that Harry-
Is dead.

01:19:56.371 --> 01:20:01.434
- What a horrible complication.
- Oh!

01:20:01.510 --> 01:20:04.775
I don't know that it is.

01:20:04.847 --> 01:20:07.111
What are you
looking at me for?

01:20:10.219 --> 01:20:12.881
Sammy, I'll do anything
to help you, but please,

01:20:12.955 --> 01:20:15.719
please don't ask me
to dig up Harry again!

01:20:15.791 --> 01:20:19.124
- Oh, come, come now, Captain.
- No, we can't.

01:20:19.194 --> 01:20:22.129
If you're thinking
of the bad publicity-
<i>No, I'm not.</i>

01:20:23.499 --> 01:20:27.367
I think Sam would be
worth just about anything.

01:20:27.436 --> 01:20:29.836
I'm thinking of you,
Miss Gravely.

01:20:29.905 --> 01:20:34.968
Murder is murder,
no matter how exonerating
the circumstances and-

01:20:35.043 --> 01:20:37.341
It just wouldn't
look nice at all for you.

01:20:37.412 --> 01:20:40.313
That's right!
Better let him
stay where he is.

01:20:40.382 --> 01:20:44.216
You won't
have to wait seven years
to presume death, anyway.

01:20:44.286 --> 01:20:46.220
Seven years!
I'll be an old man.

01:20:46.288 --> 01:20:49.348
Don't be silly.
You waited far longer
than seven years already.

01:20:49.424 --> 01:20:52.757
Yes, but now I know
what I'm waiting for.

01:20:52.828 --> 01:20:54.989
<i>I insist that you dig</i>
<i>the wretched man up.</i>

01:20:55.063 --> 01:20:57.691
I don't care a hoot
what they say.

01:20:57.766 --> 01:21:00.929
They'd only have to know me
to realize the man
must have been mad.

01:21:01.003 --> 01:21:05.406
I disagree! Huh!
Really, Capt. Wiles.

01:21:07.176 --> 01:21:09.269
<i>Well-</i>

01:21:09.344 --> 01:21:11.539
I'll dig him up.

01:21:11.613 --> 01:21:14.013
But we'd better get it done
before Calvin Wiggs...

01:21:14.082 --> 01:21:16.744
gets the state police
snooping around here.

01:21:23.559 --> 01:21:26.323
[Jennifer]
I've been thinking.

01:21:26.395 --> 01:21:30.559
I've been thinking
maybe we could forget
the way it really happened.

01:21:30.632 --> 01:21:33.567
I could tell how Harry
visited me and went off
in such a rage today,

01:21:33.635 --> 01:21:37.196
and that's all we'd need to know
about his being there.

01:21:37.272 --> 01:21:39.331
No, somebody else
might get the blame.

01:21:39.408 --> 01:21:43.469
And somebody else
might not have
such a good reason as I did.

01:21:43.545 --> 01:21:46.912
What do you mean
"somebody else"?

01:21:46.982 --> 01:21:50.941
I can think of at least
two people with a good reason
for having killed Harry.

01:21:51.019 --> 01:21:55.183
First you,
because you married him.
And now Sam.

01:21:55.257 --> 01:21:58.624
Me? Why would I
want to kill him?
I never met him before.

01:21:58.694 --> 01:22:01.185
<i>You could still have a reason</i>
<i>for killing him.</i>

01:22:01.263 --> 01:22:03.390
She means me.
Yes.

01:22:03.465 --> 01:22:06.992
I didn't fall
in love with Jennifer
until after Harry was dead.

01:22:07.069 --> 01:22:09.128
Try telling that
to the police.

01:22:09.204 --> 01:22:12.469
She's right,
Sammy boy.

01:22:12.541 --> 01:22:17.103
Well, on second thought,
we'd better stick to the truth,
what there is of it.

01:22:23.418 --> 01:22:27.548
We'll have to think up
a reason why the police
weren't informed before now.

01:22:27.623 --> 01:22:31.081
Yes, then there's
the condition he's in.
That'll take some explaining.

01:22:31.159 --> 01:22:33.787
We'll just
clean him up a bit.

01:22:33.862 --> 01:22:36.695
It's horrible, but there's
nothing else we can do.

01:22:36.765 --> 01:22:39.359
We can't risk complicating
Miss Gravely's confession.

01:22:39.434 --> 01:22:42.267
And as for the delay, I can
explain that I was so upset...

01:22:42.337 --> 01:22:45.932
by the occurrence that...
I went straight home and rested.

01:22:46.008 --> 01:22:49.671
Only natural.
They'll think you rested
rather a long time.

01:22:49.745 --> 01:22:52.839
Sam, I'd rather not spend
the whole night debating.

01:22:52.914 --> 01:22:55.246
Let's get Harry someplace
and clean him up.

01:22:55.317 --> 01:22:59.686

<i>If this be error</i>
<i>and upon me proved,</i>

01:23:21.109 --> 01:23:25.239
I never writ,

01:23:34.923 --> 01:23:39.223
I, uh, I think he met
with a bit of an accident,
Dr. Greenbow.

01:23:39.294 --> 01:23:41.228
<i>He certainly did.</i>

01:23:42.964 --> 01:23:44.898
<i>Which of you</i>
<i>found him?</i>

01:23:44.966 --> 01:23:47.935
Well-
He was my husband, Doctor.

01:23:48.003 --> 01:23:51.666
Oh, Mrs. Rogers. I didn't
know you had a husband.

01:23:51.740 --> 01:23:54.038
I'm awfully sorry.

01:23:54.109 --> 01:23:57.272
It's all right, Doctor.
It's just life, I guess.

01:23:57.346 --> 01:23:59.940
What happened to him?
Well, he-

01:24:00.015 --> 01:24:04.884
That's what we'd like to know.
Could you tell us what caused
his death? It was so sudden.

01:24:04.953 --> 01:24:07.478
In this light, my opinion
would be little more
than a guess.

01:24:07.556 --> 01:24:10.423
In that case, we could
take him someplace
where you could see better.

01:24:10.492 --> 01:24:14.087
All right,
but I need my bag.
Where shall we meet?

01:24:14.162 --> 01:24:16.596
I'll take Harry
home to my house.

01:24:19.968 --> 01:24:23.460
Going home
for the last time.

01:24:28.143 --> 01:24:30.373
Better be
the last time.

01:24:30.445 --> 01:24:33.881
Come on, Sam. I've got
about one more trip left in me.

01:24:33.949 --> 01:24:36.144
I'll get your coats.

01:25:30.906 --> 01:25:32.840
I'll get the suspenders on.

01:25:39.881 --> 01:25:43.248
I can't wait
for this to be ready.
I'll have to iron it dry.

01:25:45.120 --> 01:25:47.054
Isn't it odd?

01:25:47.122 --> 01:25:51.855
After refusing
for so long, here I am
finally doing Harry's laundry.

[Whispers]
Look.

01:26:15.050 --> 01:26:17.644
It's nothing to get
excited about, Captain.

01:26:17.719 --> 01:26:20.688
It's only a closet door.

01:26:20.755 --> 01:26:23.451
Oh. I thought
it was Harry.

01:26:23.525 --> 01:26:26.255
Relax, Captain.
Nothing to worry about.

01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:35.299
What about the cut
I made on his head
with my hiking shoe?

01:26:35.370 --> 01:26:38.464
[Jennifer]
Hmm. I'll put
some adhesive tape on it.

01:26:38.540 --> 01:26:40.531
They'll think it was done
before he died.

01:26:40.609 --> 01:26:43.544
After the shirt's finished,
it should be just about
everything.

01:26:43.612 --> 01:26:45.546
<i>[Car Approaching]</i>

01:26:45.614 --> 01:26:48.412
If that who
I think it is-
Calvin Wiggs' car.

01:27:01.563 --> 01:27:04.031
<i>[Door Buzzer Buzzing]</i>

01:27:09.271 --> 01:27:11.831
<i>[Buzzing]</i>

01:27:11.907 --> 01:27:14.068
<i>[Jennifer]</i>
<i>Just one second.</i>

01:27:18.914 --> 01:27:21.576
<i>[Buzzer]</i>

01:27:23.752 --> 01:27:26.516
Well, Calvin Wiggs.
What a surprise.

01:27:26.588 --> 01:27:29.455
Sam here?
Yes, yes, yes,
he's here.

01:27:29.524 --> 01:27:32.516
Can I see him
a minute?

01:27:32.594 --> 01:27:34.528
Sam!
<i>Yeah?</i>

01:27:34.596 --> 01:27:36.928
Calvin Wiggs
is here to see you.

01:27:36.998 --> 01:27:38.932
<i>Tell him I'll be right out.</i>

01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:42.492
He says he'll be right out.
Why don't I just go on in?

01:27:48.143 --> 01:27:50.111
Evening, Calvin.

01:27:50.178 --> 01:27:53.579
Evening, Capt. Wiles.
Miss Gravely.

01:27:53.648 --> 01:27:55.775
We've got 'em on the run
in four spades.

01:27:55.850 --> 01:27:59.013
[Chuckling]
They should have been
in diamonds.

01:27:59.087 --> 01:28:01.954
Play much bridge?
Never play it.

01:28:02.023 --> 01:28:05.925
- That's what I thought.
- Something you wanted, Calvin?

01:28:05.994 --> 01:28:09.361
- Where were you today, Sam?
- Working, as usual.

01:28:09.431 --> 01:28:13.595
Somewheres down
by Mansfield Meadows?

01:28:13.668 --> 01:28:16.000
Possibly. I do quite a bit
of sketching around. Why?

01:28:19.507 --> 01:28:21.941
Is that where, uh-

01:28:23.878 --> 01:28:26.312
Where you painted this?

01:28:28.683 --> 01:28:31.049
I left that portrait
with your mother.

01:28:31.119 --> 01:28:33.553
What right do you have
to carry it around with you?
It might be damaged.

01:28:33.622 --> 01:28:37.649
Huh. It could be priceless,
and Sam would lose a sale.

01:28:37.726 --> 01:28:41.389
Oh, I'll send him
a box of blueberries
the first of every month.

01:28:41.463 --> 01:28:44.489
<i>Sam, what I wanna know is</i>
<i>where'd you paint it</i>
<i>and who is it?</i>

01:28:44.566 --> 01:28:47.933
First of all,
it's not a painting.
It's a drawing.

01:28:48.003 --> 01:28:50.301
Matter of fact,
it's a pastel and...

01:28:50.372 --> 01:28:54.274
as for the model,
just came to me
out of the blue.

01:28:54.342 --> 01:28:58.403
- You don't say.
- Why are you acting
like a deputy sheriff?

01:28:58.480 --> 01:29:01.244
That tramp I picked up,
the one with the stolen shoes?

01:29:01.282 --> 01:29:04.046
<i>Said he got 'em</i>
<i>off a dead man?</i>

01:29:04.119 --> 01:29:08.112
<i>He described him very carefully.</i>
<i>The description fits</i>
<i>this picture to a "T."</i>

01:29:08.189 --> 01:29:12.125
A tramp who probably
can't keep his job
and drinks too much-

01:29:12.193 --> 01:29:14.684
I wouldn't think his word
was very reliable.

01:29:14.763 --> 01:29:18.096
Got him locked up
in the schoolhouse.

01:29:18.166 --> 01:29:20.657
I took this painting
down to show him-
Drawing, if you don't mind.

01:29:20.735 --> 01:29:23.670
I took the drawing
down to show him.
He almost fainted.

01:29:23.738 --> 01:29:26.866
<i>Said it was the same face.</i>
<i>Where'd you paint it, Sam?</i>

01:29:29.144 --> 01:29:31.908
From my vast subconscious.

01:29:31.980 --> 01:29:35.882
<i>Sam, I hate to say this,</i>
<i>but I don't believe you.</i>

01:29:35.950 --> 01:29:37.884
With all this talk,
I've lost interest
in the game.

01:29:37.952 --> 01:29:40.512
If you'll forgive me,
I'll just run along home.

01:29:40.588 --> 01:29:43.853
<i>I'll see you all</i>
<i>tomorrow.</i>

01:29:45.794 --> 01:29:48.194
What do you mean,
you don't believe me?

01:29:48.263 --> 01:29:53.428
What I mean, Sam-
I ain't educated
in fancy art,

01:29:53.501 --> 01:29:57.301
but I do know the face
of a dead man when I see one,
and this is it.

01:29:57.372 --> 01:30:01.206
Calvin, perhaps I can
educate you to, um, "fancy art."

01:30:02.377 --> 01:30:06.006
See this?
Portrait of a sleeping face.

01:30:06.081 --> 01:30:10.916
A man, relaxed, far removed
from earthly cares.

01:30:10.985 --> 01:30:15.149
It was conceived out of memory
and half-forgotten impulse,

01:30:15.223 --> 01:30:17.714
<i>and it emerged from the shadows</i>
<i>of abstract emotions,</i>

01:30:17.792 --> 01:30:22.957
<i>until it was born full-grown</i>
<i>from the mechanical reality</i>
<i>of my fingertips.</i>

01:30:23.031 --> 01:30:25.761
Oh, now Sam, don't-
<i>I don't have to have</i>
<i>a model to draw from.</i>

01:30:25.834 --> 01:30:28.530
Instead of creating
a sleeping face,
I could have, um,

01:30:28.603 --> 01:30:31.936
chosen an entirely different set
of artistic stimuli.

01:30:32.006 --> 01:30:36.238
My subconscious is peopled
with enough faces
to cover the earth.

01:30:36.311 --> 01:30:40.748
And the construction
of the human anatomy alone
is so infinitely variable...

01:30:40.815 --> 01:30:43.784
as to lie beyond the wildest
powers of calculation.

01:30:43.852 --> 01:30:47.982
Now, a raised eyelid,
perhaps.

01:30:51.059 --> 01:30:54.551
A line of fullness
to the cheek.

01:30:54.629 --> 01:30:57.325
Lip that bends
with expression.

01:30:59.200 --> 01:31:01.134
There.

01:31:02.403 --> 01:31:05.566
Sam, do you-
Do you know what you just did?

01:31:05.640 --> 01:31:09.838
<i>Certainly.</i>
<i>Just showed you how clearly</i>
<i>you misinterpreted my art.</i>

01:31:09.911 --> 01:31:13.108
You just destroyed
legal evidence.

01:31:14.415 --> 01:31:18.249
Calvin, it appears to me
you still don't understand.

01:31:18.319 --> 01:31:21.288
I understand you made
kind of a fool out of me.

01:31:21.356 --> 01:31:24.689
But I still got enough evidence
to know something funny's
goin' on around here.

01:31:24.759 --> 01:31:27.660
I ain't goin' to sleep
till I find out what it is.

01:31:30.532 --> 01:31:33.126
<i>[Jennifer]</i>
<i>Good night, Calvin.</i>

01:31:36.971 --> 01:31:39.633
Hey! What's he doin'
in our bathtub?

01:31:42.677 --> 01:31:45.771
- <i>That's where frogs belong.</i>
- <i>[Arnie] Oh.</i>

01:31:45.847 --> 01:31:49.613
- Back to bed, Arnie.
- <i>State troopers'll be up</i>
<i>in the mornin'.</i>

01:31:49.684 --> 01:31:52.949
I'm gonna want 'em
to have a talk with you,
so be around.

01:31:53.021 --> 01:31:56.047
- [Whispering]
I said back to bed.
- You can find me at my studio.

01:31:56.124 --> 01:32:00.220
Just make sure-
<i>[Knocking At Door]</i>

01:32:03.398 --> 01:32:05.332
Where is he?

01:32:07.402 --> 01:32:09.563
He-He's in the bathroom
playing with his frog.

01:32:12.207 --> 01:32:16.143
- Oh?
- I'm-This way, please,
Doctor.

01:32:17.979 --> 01:32:20.140
It's Arnie.
He's not very well.

01:32:20.215 --> 01:32:23.742
<i>[Car Horn Honking]</i>

01:32:23.818 --> 01:32:25.877
Someone must be
foolin' around with my car.

01:32:37.131 --> 01:32:40.692
What are you playin'
with the horn for?
It ain't your car.

01:32:40.768 --> 01:32:43.601
Well, things are funny,
you know?

01:32:43.671 --> 01:32:47.004
Me and Miss Gravely
might be in the car market.
We're looking for a car.

01:32:47.075 --> 01:32:50.272
Yes. Had a look at this one.
It's a beauty.

01:32:50.345 --> 01:32:52.336
I want to keep it
that way.

01:32:52.413 --> 01:32:55.678
Now, now,
that's not the way to talk
to a prospective customer.

01:32:55.750 --> 01:32:59.083
You're no prospective customer.
You can't afford this car.

01:33:11.599 --> 01:33:13.533
He's gone.

01:33:13.601 --> 01:33:17.264
I put the little-
I put Arnie back to bed.

01:33:17.338 --> 01:33:20.239
What'd the doctor say?
He said for me to get out.

01:33:20.308 --> 01:33:24.335
I didn't like the look
in his eye, either. Something
seems to be bothering him.

01:33:26.881 --> 01:33:30.612
<i>Well, Captain.</i>
<i>Did you get over</i>
<i>being frightened?</i>

01:33:31.786 --> 01:33:34.311
Frightened?
[Laughing]

01:33:34.389 --> 01:33:37.051
Oh, no.
That's not why I left.

01:33:37.125 --> 01:33:40.652
No. I'm not easily frightened,
you know. No.

01:33:40.728 --> 01:33:44.664
Why, after all those years
sailing the four corners
of the globe,

01:33:44.732 --> 01:33:48.224
<i>strange ports, a lot</i>
<i>of rough men and-</i>

01:33:50.939 --> 01:33:55.035
Miss Gravely,
what would you say...

01:33:55.109 --> 01:33:57.168
if I told you...

01:33:57.245 --> 01:34:00.237
I was only the captain
of a tugboat...

01:34:00.315 --> 01:34:02.249
on the East River...

01:34:02.317 --> 01:34:05.878
and never got more
than a mile or so off shore?

01:34:12.493 --> 01:34:15.189
Well, I would say that,

01:34:15.263 --> 01:34:18.027
that you were the
handsomest tugboat captain...

01:34:18.099 --> 01:34:20.329
that ever sailed
up the East River.

01:34:22.203 --> 01:34:24.831
[Chuckling]
Oh, maybe not. No.

01:34:24.906 --> 01:34:28.069
You want to see something?
Here.

01:34:30.311 --> 01:34:32.245
Captain.
Where'd you get those?

01:34:32.313 --> 01:34:35.578
Calvin Wiggs' car.

01:34:35.650 --> 01:34:37.584
I figured you were handling
half the evidence, Sammy,

01:34:37.652 --> 01:34:39.847
so it was up to me
to take care of the rest.

01:34:39.921 --> 01:34:43.049
You're the sweetest, old
tugboat captain I ever kissed.

01:34:43.758 --> 01:34:46.090
What's he doing
in the bathtub?

01:34:46.160 --> 01:34:48.958
Well, uh-
What'd you find out,
Doctor?

01:34:49.030 --> 01:34:53.399
Oh, that.
It was his heart.
He had a seizure.

01:34:53.468 --> 01:34:56.198
His heart?
<i>Yes, but-</i>

01:34:56.270 --> 01:34:59.364
A seizure!
Well, I'll take a trip
to the Philippines.

01:34:59.440 --> 01:35:02.432
Death from natural causes.
<i>Well, certainly.</i>

01:35:02.510 --> 01:35:06.640
But will somebody tell me
what he's doin' in the bathtub
half undressed?

01:35:08.583 --> 01:35:11.518
Frankly, we didn't want
Calvin Wiggs to see him.

01:35:13.621 --> 01:35:16.112
Besides, he was awful dirty
after we dug him up.

01:35:16.190 --> 01:35:18.590
"Dug him up"?

01:35:18.659 --> 01:35:21.389
I'd better explain, Doctor.
You see,

01:35:21.462 --> 01:35:24.454
Harry's been buried and dug up
on and off all day long.

01:35:24.532 --> 01:35:26.466
What?

01:35:26.534 --> 01:35:28.798
Finally, he caused
so many complications that...

01:35:28.870 --> 01:35:32.203
we decided to clean him up
and put him back
where we found him.

01:35:32.273 --> 01:35:34.798
<i>I don't understand you.</i>
<i>What complications?</i>

01:35:34.876 --> 01:35:37.436
Well, for example,

01:35:37.512 --> 01:35:40.913
he upset Capt. Wiles
because the captain
thought he had shot him.

01:35:40.982 --> 01:35:44.713
<i>The hole in the head,</i>
<i>you know. But as it turned out,</i>
<i>it wasn't the captain.</i>

01:35:44.786 --> 01:35:48.017
It was the blow he got from
the heel of Miss Gravely's shoe
after he attacked her.

01:35:48.089 --> 01:35:50.819
Capt. Wiles
attacked Miss Gravely?

01:35:50.892 --> 01:35:53.759
Oh, no, Doctor. Harry.

01:35:53.828 --> 01:35:56.422
He dragged her into the bushes,
thinking it was me.

01:35:56.497 --> 01:36:00.729
<i>He was dazed, I supposed,</i>
<i>after I hit him on the head</i>
<i>with a milk bottle.</i>

01:36:00.802 --> 01:36:03.100
[Sighing]

01:36:04.772 --> 01:36:07.605
The captain and Sam
buried him first.

01:36:07.675 --> 01:36:10.337
[Giggles]
The captain was so scared.

01:36:10.411 --> 01:36:14.814
Then he accounted
for all his bullets,
so up Harry came.

01:36:14.882 --> 01:36:17.442
Then Miss Gravely thought
her shoe was responsible
for it so-

01:36:17.518 --> 01:36:21.716
- Shoe?
- So the captain-
rather gallantly, I thought-

01:36:21.789 --> 01:36:23.723
pushed him back in again.

01:36:23.791 --> 01:36:27.022
Then he was out and back-
I can't remember why.

01:36:27.095 --> 01:36:30.155
But anyway, he's out again now
because Sam and I
wanna get married.

01:36:30.231 --> 01:36:33.359
Yeah. But why did you-

01:36:33.434 --> 01:36:35.368
<i>Hit him on the head?</i>

01:36:35.436 --> 01:36:38.769
That wouldn't interest you.
It's purely personal
and nonmedical.

01:36:38.840 --> 01:36:42.435
Besides, it's awfully late,
so if you'll just keep quiet
about all this,

01:36:42.510 --> 01:36:44.774
we'll put Harry back
in the morning, nice and clean,

01:36:44.846 --> 01:36:46.780
and no one will be
any the wiser.

01:36:46.848 --> 01:36:49.373
And then we'll be
rid of all these
sticky complications.

01:36:49.450 --> 01:36:51.748
Put him back.
Put him back, that's all.
Just put him back.

01:36:51.819 --> 01:36:55.118
This is the first nightmare
I've had in 25 years.

01:36:59.127 --> 01:37:00.992
He's kinda strange,
isn't he?

01:37:07.268 --> 01:37:11.398
[Chuckling]
Well, um, hadn't we better
get Harry dressed?

01:37:11.472 --> 01:37:13.440
[Sam] Yes, yes.

01:37:20.581 --> 01:37:23.106
Wouldn't it be nice
if Arnie found him
all over again?

01:37:23.184 --> 01:37:26.153
Then he'd run home and tell me,
and then I'd phone Calvin Wiggs.

01:37:26.220 --> 01:37:29.383
Yes! Arnie could explain
quite clearly to Calvin-

01:37:29.457 --> 01:37:33.359
That he found Harry
tomorrow.
You mean today.

01:37:33.427 --> 01:37:35.827
But to Arnie,
tomorrow is yesterday.

01:37:37.698 --> 01:37:39.723
Let's go get Harry.
Come on, Captain.

01:37:51.946 --> 01:37:54.244
<i>[Birds Chirping]</i>

01:37:54.315 --> 01:37:56.249
Here he comes.

01:38:15.903 --> 01:38:17.837
Go on, Arnie.
Run home and tell me about it.

01:38:17.905 --> 01:38:19.839
Don't touch him.

01:38:19.907 --> 01:38:22.398
Please, Arnie, run home
and tell your mother.

01:38:22.476 --> 01:38:24.569
Beat it,
you little creep.

01:38:24.645 --> 01:38:28.274
I mean,
hurry home, son.

01:38:37.425 --> 01:38:39.916
Captain, you never told me
your first name.

01:38:39.994 --> 01:38:41.928
Albert.
What's yours?

01:38:41.996 --> 01:38:46.194
Ivy.
Albert, let's go.

01:38:46.267 --> 01:38:48.201
Just a minute, ma'am.
I want to ask Sam something.

01:38:48.269 --> 01:38:51.238
Sam, what did you
ask the millionaire
to bring you?

01:38:59.747 --> 01:39:01.681
Albert,
what was it?

01:39:03.017 --> 01:39:05.508
[Whispering]
A double bed.
<i>[Laughing]</i>

01:39:06.305 --> 01:39:12.774
