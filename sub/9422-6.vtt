It's certainly been enough
for kiki.

I'm not going to get together

02:34.788 --> 02:36.788

giddy to drink in

(Engine revs, tires squeal)

02:54.608 --> 02:57.442
(Lisa) So, Simon,
what exactly brings you here?

02:57.444 --> 02:59.444
I heard you had opened
a gallery,

02:59.446 --> 03:02.014
so I just wanted to stop in
and take a look,

03:02.016 --> 03:03.849
and then I saw this.

03:03.851 --> 03:06.852
Though he's a little too obvious
with his derivations

03:06.854 --> 03:08.854
without being really clear
about his intentions,

03:08.856 --> 03:11.390
I-I just--I keep
coming back to it.

03:11.392 --> 03:14.393
Best kind of art is the kind you
can't make up your mind about.

03:14.395 --> 03:15.894
Ambivalence.
Exactly.

03:15.896 --> 03:18.497
We both know
a lot about that, hmm?

03:18.499 --> 03:19.998
I'm sorry?

03:20.000 --> 03:24.570
I mean, we're both with people
who can't make up their minds.

03:24.572 --> 03:27.873
I thought you said
you came here for the art.

03:27.875 --> 03:29.841
I did. I did.
I'll take the painting.

03:29.843 --> 03:34.546
And while I'm here, Lisa,
I'll also give you this.

03:34.548 --> 03:38.517
It's a conversation between
my Karen and your Nick

03:38.519 --> 03:40.719
captured by
my security cameras.

03:40.721 --> 03:43.422
It's worth watching,
even if...

03:43.424 --> 03:45.424
Just to clear up
a few ambiguities.

03:45.426 --> 03:48.594
Yeah? Well, let me
clear up some of yours.

03:48.596 --> 03:51.663
I'm not sure what kind
of thing gets you off,

03:51.665 --> 03:54.833
but I'm not the kind of woman
who spies on my husband.

03:54.835 --> 03:56.368
(Thud)

03:56.370 --> 03:58.870
Will that be cash
or charge?

03:58.872 --> 04:01.974
(Patrick) Well, let me
spell it out for you.

04:01.976 --> 04:04.943
Everyone you recommended, dad,
to be my chief of staff--

04:04.945 --> 04:06.945
every one of them--
in one way or another,

04:06.947 --> 04:09.615
belongs to you,
and I need someone

04:09.617 --> 04:12.584
who will be working for me,
ergo nola.

04:12.586 --> 04:15.354
She prosecuted your mother.
Exactly.

04:15.356 --> 04:18.757
What better way to demonstrate
that I don't hold a grudge

04:18.759 --> 04:20.625
and that I'm someone
who's willing

04:20.628 --> 04:22.894
to reach across
the aisle and--
oh, paddy.

04:22.896 --> 04:25.430
Mr. darling,
perhaps your hearing

04:25.432 --> 04:27.933
isn't what it used to be.
I beg your pardon.

04:27.935 --> 04:31.036
(Loud voice) Your son
has already given me the job.

04:33.440 --> 04:35.941
Now let's
get down to business.

04:35.943 --> 04:39.478
What do you suggest, nola?
Committee assignments. We hear
you folks have thoughts.

04:39.480 --> 04:42.848
I fish in Hampshire
in england...

04:42.850 --> 04:45.951
Every year with the chairman
of foreign affairs.

04:45.953 --> 04:48.304
He can get you a seat.

04:48.305 --> 04:50.656
That's great, dad,
except we were thinking--
you're not listening, Patrick.

04:50.658 --> 04:52.090
Foreign affairs.

04:52.092 --> 04:54.960
It positions you perfectly

04:54.962 --> 04:56.962
for a first-term run
at the white house.

04:56.964 --> 04:59.765
We've got a different idea.
Oh, but of course you do.

04:59.767 --> 05:01.750
Mm.

05:01.751 --> 05:03.734
Well, let's--
let's hear them out, Tripp.

05:03.737 --> 05:06.371
With all
the recent controversy--

05:06.373 --> 05:10.709
you know, the death, the fire,
the transsexuality of it all--

05:10.711 --> 05:13.945
we think avoiding
the spotlight would be best.

05:13.947 --> 05:17.115
Show we're serious.
We're thinking agriculture.

05:17.117 --> 05:18.917
Agriculture?

05:18.919 --> 05:21.953
You heard it right, dad.
Agriculture.

05:21.955 --> 05:23.989
Patrick wants to <i> not</i> exploit
his family connections

05:23.991 --> 05:26.124
too avidly
right out of the gate.

05:26.126 --> 05:28.660
All right. Okay.

05:28.662 --> 05:33.598
You've obviously come here
with your minds made up.

05:33.600 --> 05:36.735
I profoundly regret
that pretending to respect me

05:36.737 --> 05:38.904
has taken up so much
of your precious time.

05:38.906 --> 05:40.906
It was really nothing.

05:40.908 --> 05:43.909
I couldn't agree more.

05:43.911 --> 05:46.578
Your father doesn't like
strong women, does he?

05:46.580 --> 05:47.879
He likes mom.

05:47.881 --> 05:49.581
I said strong,
not murderous.

05:49.583 --> 05:51.583
Hey! What are you
doing here?

05:51.585 --> 05:53.885
What the hell?
What is she doing here?

05:53.887 --> 05:56.154
She's my chief of staff.

05:56.156 --> 05:58.123
We've got a meeting
in the mayor's office

05:58.125 --> 06:00.659

Absolutely not.

Nick George, family lawyer.

08:01.982 --> 08:05.083
Oh, of course.
Um, Wrenn Darcy.

08:05.085 --> 08:07.118
Nice to officially meet you.

08:07.120 --> 08:09.988
Don't worry. I'm not planning
on suing anyone.

08:09.990 --> 08:12.991
Well, whether you decide to sue
or not is entirely up to you.

08:12.993 --> 08:15.994
I'm just here to make sure
you have everything you need.

08:15.996 --> 08:18.597
Well, then you're good
at your job.

08:18.599 --> 08:20.599
I have an on-call nurse
and a maid

08:20.601 --> 08:22.934
and this person who just
keeps fluffing my pillow.

08:22.936 --> 08:24.936
Welcome to life
with the darlings.

08:24.938 --> 08:27.239
Is there anyone
I should call,

08:27.241 --> 08:29.808
let 'em know you're okay?

08:29.810 --> 08:31.810
Um, no. My family
is all up in Maine.

08:31.812 --> 08:33.812
Mm.
Besides, they don't really
worry about me.

08:33.813 --> 08:35.981
Believe it or not,

08:35.982 --> 08:38.082
working the fragrance counter
at Bendel's

08:38.085 --> 08:41.152
makes me the success
of the family.

08:43.289 --> 08:45.757
I should probably go.

08:45.759 --> 08:47.893
No, wait. The doctor wants us
to watch you for a while

08:47.895 --> 08:49.961
and make sure you don't have
a concussion.

08:49.963 --> 08:52.898
Trust me, I'm--
I'm completely sound.

08:52.900 --> 08:55.600
So please thank the darlings
for their hospitality.

08:55.602 --> 08:59.104
Tell them if they ever need
a house sitter...

08:59.106 --> 09:00.338
Just...

09:00.340 --> 09:03.375
Oh. You a little dizzy?
A little.

09:03.377 --> 09:07.212
All right. Well, just, uh,
just rest, okay?

09:07.214 --> 09:09.648
What?

09:09.650 --> 09:14.119
Uh, you're just not my idea
of a family lawyer.

09:14.121 --> 09:16.187
Get some rest.

09:16.189 --> 09:18.924
Okay, counselor.

09:18.926 --> 09:21.192
(Siren wails)

09:21.194 --> 09:23.828
It's worse than I thought.

09:23.830 --> 09:25.697
At this stage, unfortunately,

09:25.699 --> 09:28.967
the only treatment
with any real odds of success

09:28.969 --> 09:31.002
would be continuous rounds
of high-dose chemotherapy.

09:31.004 --> 09:33.838
And so what are
those odds?

09:33.840 --> 09:37.008
Optimistically, about 10% chance
of surviving 12 months.

09:37.010 --> 09:38.810
(Andrea) In bed...

09:38.812 --> 09:42.647
Sick,
in never-ending pain?

09:42.649 --> 09:45.216
So what, are you just
gonna give up?

09:45.218 --> 09:48.219
I want to spend the time
that I have left

09:48.221 --> 09:50.989
teaching our son
how to live, Brian,

09:50.991 --> 09:53.058
not how to die.

09:53.060 --> 09:56.061
I can't say that I would
recommend your choice,

09:56.063 --> 09:57.963
but I certainly understand it.

09:57.965 --> 10:01.733
So what about
the good stuff?
The good stuff?

10:01.735 --> 10:05.103
The N.I.H. Trial I read about
at this hospital, quackenbush.

10:05.105 --> 10:08.006
The waiting list to get into
the next run of that trial

10:08.008 --> 10:10.075
is over a year long.

10:10.077 --> 10:12.010
I'm sorry.

10:13.447 --> 10:15.981
Hey, grim reaper,

10:15.983 --> 10:18.984
I know how this works,
so how much is it gonna take

10:18.986 --> 10:20.986
to get her into that trial?

10:20.988 --> 10:23.288
I'm gonna pretend we're not
having this conversation.

10:23.290 --> 10:25.991
Good. I'm gonna pretend
I'm talking to a human being.

10:25.993 --> 10:28.693
There's a woman in there
with an 8-year-old son.

10:28.695 --> 10:30.695
The sad truth, Mr. darling,
is that there are

10:30.697 --> 10:32.931
thousands of women with
equally life-threatening cases

10:32.933 --> 10:37.002
who actually <i> want</i>
the treatment.

10:37.004 --> 10:39.070
You want to play rough?
Let's play rough.

10:39.072 --> 10:42.073
You know that building
you're about to break ground on,

10:42.075 --> 10:44.976
the $100-million
children's cancer wing,

10:44.978 --> 10:46.978
the one bearing
your stupid name?

10:46.980 --> 10:49.381
What if I prevent my family

10:49.383 --> 10:52.083
from signing the check
they promised?

10:52.085 --> 10:54.986
It's Andrea's decision,
Mr. darling.

10:54.988 --> 10:58.223
My family's putting up
half the jing for that wing.

10:58.225 --> 11:02.894
You make it happen.
I'll take care of Andrea.

11:05.399 --> 11:06.998
She's gonna be okay.

11:07.000 --> 11:10.068
And she's not looking
to make any trouble.

11:10.070 --> 11:12.303
Thank God.
But I think for her sake

11:12.305 --> 11:14.472
and for the sake
of avoiding a scandal,

11:14.474 --> 11:17.842
you're going to have
a house guest for a while.

11:17.844 --> 11:21.813
Nicky, do you honestly think
it's safe having her here?

11:21.815 --> 11:24.983
As long as you don't
take her for a drive.
(Laughs) Letitia...

11:24.985 --> 11:28.920
Whatever the girl needs,
she shall have.

11:28.922 --> 11:31.089
She's the injured party.
That's how it should be.

11:31.091 --> 11:34.859
Shades of Lucy Tennbrook.
(Sighs)

11:40.367 --> 11:42.067
You're kidding me, right?

11:42.069 --> 11:44.069
You say you want me
out of your life,

11:44.071 --> 11:46.471
and then you get a job
working for my brother?
I fell on hard times.

11:46.473 --> 11:49.407
Or should I say
I was pushed?
Or maybe it's neither one.

11:49.409 --> 11:52.277
Maybe you are just obsessed
with all things darling.

11:52.279 --> 11:54.813
I mean, if you're not
prosecuting a darling,

11:54.815 --> 11:56.147
you're sleeping with one.

11:56.149 --> 11:59.484
If you're not
sleeping with a darling...

11:59.486 --> 12:01.386
What exactly are you doing
for my brother?

12:01.388 --> 12:04.823
Patrick, unlike some people to
whom he's related, has guts.

12:04.825 --> 12:07.025
He was generous enough
to give me a second chance

12:07.027 --> 12:10.061
when my career fell into
the crapper thanks to you.

12:10.063 --> 12:13.465
Oh, so this is your way
of getting back at me, right,

12:13.467 --> 12:16.434
by cozying up to Patrick?
Get over yourself, Jeremy.
I have.

12:16.436 --> 12:18.503
You should, too, pronto.

12:20.540 --> 12:22.307
(Tires squeal)

12:23.944 --> 12:27.312
You look pretty.
Thank you.

12:27.314 --> 12:29.314
Kiki and I spent
an hour and a half

12:29.316 --> 12:32.283
picking out this outfit.
(Laughs)

12:32.285 --> 12:35.186
Can you imagine? Being nervous
for a date with my husband.

12:35.188 --> 12:38.456
Not to say this is a date,
because I...

12:38.458 --> 12:41.059
(Exhales deeply)

12:42.295 --> 12:44.095
How are you doing?

12:44.097 --> 12:45.964
Honestly?

12:45.966 --> 12:47.065
Mm-hmm.

12:47.067 --> 12:48.566
It's weird

12:48.568 --> 12:50.869
after all these years
to wake up alone every day.

12:50.871 --> 12:53.571
(Chuckles) I guess I'd feel
pretty weird, too,

12:53.573 --> 12:55.573
if I was actually sleeping.

12:55.575 --> 12:58.042
You know,
you could move back in?

12:58.044 --> 13:00.044
(Piano music playing)

13:00.046 --> 13:02.046
I want
to make this work, Lise.

13:02.048 --> 13:04.015
I do, too,

13:04.017 --> 13:06.084
completely,

13:06.086 --> 13:08.052
but I...

13:08.054 --> 13:09.254
But?

13:09.256 --> 13:12.190
Simon elder stopped by
the gallery today.

13:12.192 --> 13:15.026
What the hell did he want?
He bought a painting,

13:15.028 --> 13:16.961
a very expensive one,

13:16.963 --> 13:19.931
and he mentioned something
about Karen,

13:19.933 --> 13:22.600
about a conversation you had--
I did speak with Karen recently.
I told her not to marry Simon.

13:22.602 --> 13:25.603
Okay.
The only reason that Simon wants
to marry her is to get control

13:25.605 --> 13:27.822
of darling enterprises stock.

13:27.823 --> 13:30.040
I had to tell her not to do it.
I was doing my job.

13:30.043 --> 13:32.043
I want us to work,

13:32.045 --> 13:35.046
but we--we can't if Karen is
always going to be lingering

13:35.048 --> 13:37.115
on the edge of our lives.

13:37.117 --> 13:38.983
We can't.

13:38.985 --> 13:40.652
She's not.

13:40.654 --> 13:42.353
Promise me...

13:42.355 --> 13:45.356
Karen darling will no longer
be a part of your life--

13:45.358 --> 13:48.092
or ours--anymore.

13:48.094 --> 13:51.396
I promise you,
Karen darling and I are done.

14:04.911 --> 14:07.178
(Woman) Nick George
is here to see you.

14:07.180 --> 14:08.680
Okay, send him in.

14:08.682 --> 14:11.616
That's all for now, gentlemen.
Thank you.

14:11.618 --> 14:13.985
Well... (Sighs)

14:13.987 --> 14:16.154
Hello, Nick.

14:16.156 --> 14:18.990
You don't seem too happy.
What's the problem?

14:18.992 --> 14:21.960
The problem is that you need
to stay away from my wife.

14:21.962 --> 14:23.461
(Laughs)

14:23.463 --> 14:25.163
Um...

14:25.165 --> 14:27.165
Okay,
I can't speak for you,

14:27.167 --> 14:30.001
but usually,
when I'm this angry,

14:30.003 --> 14:32.003
it's from
a lack of perspective.

14:32.005 --> 14:35.106
So...

14:35.108 --> 14:37.141
So let me help you out.

14:37.143 --> 14:40.478

(Simon) See?

15:14.547 --> 15:18.049
You mess with my lady,
you mess with my stuff,

15:18.051 --> 15:20.385
I mess with yours.

15:20.387 --> 15:22.553
Just consider it
a life lesson.

15:22.555 --> 15:24.555
I mean, you can't learn
everything you know

15:24.557 --> 15:26.724
from Tripp darling.

15:26.726 --> 15:28.693
Oh...

15:28.695 --> 15:30.194
I'd show you out,

15:30.196 --> 15:33.331

by now, you know the way.

15:51.618 --> 15:55.019
So... what do you think?

15:55.021 --> 15:58.690
I think I'm a lucky man,
able to look at someone I love

15:58.692 --> 16:01.326
and know she feels
exactly the same way for me.

16:01.328 --> 16:05.797
That's the most precious thing
in the world. (Chuckles)

16:05.799 --> 16:08.166
(Laughs)
Let me take you out tonight.

16:08.168 --> 16:11.102
Oh, I'm sorry. I can't.
I have a family dinner.

16:11.104 --> 16:14.105
With the same family
that disowned you?
Well, yeah, mommy made me
promise I'd come

16:14.107 --> 16:17.041
so she'd have somebody
to gossip with

16:17.043 --> 16:18.710
while daddy and Patrick argue

16:18.711 --> 16:20.378
over what senate committee
he's gonna be on.
(Chuckles)

16:20.380 --> 16:23.781
So that's what goes on
at these darling family dinners?

16:23.783 --> 16:25.783
Yeah.
"Page six" would be
very disappointed.

Relax.

I told you, Patrick's ready
to go with agriculture.

17:03.723 --> 17:05.723
Tripp gave in.
Okay, don't be fooled.

17:05.724 --> 17:08.092
One thing Tripp darling
doesn't do is give in.

17:08.094 --> 17:09.861
I can't launch
my bio-fuel next quarter

17:09.863 --> 17:11.863
without some high-profile
political support.

You're in.

17:32.552 --> 17:34.752

The trial.

17:34.754 --> 17:37.722
The experimental cancer drug--
I pulled some strings.

I told you
I didn't want treatment,

experimental or otherwise.

Let me guess, Brian.

17:47.801 --> 17:49.267
Money?

17:51.304 --> 17:53.371
You amaze me.

17:53.373 --> 17:54.906

Because I have values?

when you should be
taking medicine--
I am proving

18:03.850 --> 18:05.850
that there is more to life
than avoiding death.

18:05.852 --> 18:08.586
Listen to me,
you willful bitch.

18:08.588 --> 18:13.257
You're gonna take the meds
and thank me.
You are such an idiot.

18:13.259 --> 18:15.159

Mm.

It's a good sign.

19:04.210 --> 19:06.410
And truth be told,

19:06.412 --> 19:09.447
it's been refreshing
to have you in the house,

19:09.449 --> 19:12.350

the circumstances

very much.

19:26.833 --> 19:30.601

19:30.603 --> 19:31.969
It's admirable,

19:31.971 --> 19:34.338
standing so faithfully
beside someone

19:34.340 --> 19:36.340
who's been
less than faithful to you.

19:42.348 --> 19:43.848
Uh, no, hardly.

19:43.850 --> 19:46.017
Simply a man who...

19:46.019 --> 19:48.386
40-some years ago...

19:48.388 --> 19:50.988
Found the girl of his dreams.

19:50.990 --> 19:56.027

19:56.029 --> 19:57.962
I hope
that wasn't out of line,

19:57.964 --> 19:59.964

No.

19:59.966 --> 20:02.700
I just--
on the contrary,
I... I appreciate it.

20:02.702 --> 20:04.435
I have friends.

20:04.437 --> 20:06.437

have yet to mention it.

20:16.282 --> 20:20.017
Can afford to take
a million second chances,

20:20.019 --> 20:24.422
but you still hold on
to the first one.

20:26.759 --> 20:29.060

I might even wait forever.

21:05.632 --> 21:09.500
(Telephone rings)

21:09.502 --> 21:11.002
Nick George's office.

21:11.004 --> 21:13.070
(Lisa) Is he in?

21:13.072 --> 21:15.606
He's in
a closed-door meeting.

21:15.608 --> 21:16.907
With whom?

21:16.909 --> 21:19.043
I'm not sure.

21:19.045 --> 21:22.380
Daisy, it's me.
You can tell me.

21:22.382 --> 21:24.415
I can't do it.

21:26.886 --> 21:28.819
Is it Karen darling?

21:28.821 --> 21:32.490
Yes. Do you want
to leave a message?

21:32.492 --> 21:36.594
Is that your final answer?
(Laughs)

21:36.596 --> 21:39.997
No. There'll be no message.

21:39.999 --> 21:41.832
Final answer.

21:41.834 --> 21:45.770
I wish I could say
I'm surprised.

21:45.772 --> 21:47.972
Look, I have to make
things work with Lisa.

21:47.974 --> 21:50.374
I owe it to her.
I owe it to kiki.

21:50.376 --> 21:53.377
Mm-hmm. And what about you?
I want to do the right thing.

21:53.379 --> 21:55.613
Oh.

21:55.615 --> 21:57.615
Of course you do.

21:57.617 --> 22:01.052
And I love Lisa.
I love you, too.

22:01.054 --> 22:03.921
I always have,
and you know that.

22:03.923 --> 22:06.691
But I just--she's my wife,
and look, I can't apologize

22:06.693 --> 22:08.392
for doing the right thing.

22:08.394 --> 22:10.828
Mm.

22:12.965 --> 22:14.432
(Sighs)

22:14.434 --> 22:17.468
(Keypad beeps)

22:17.470 --> 22:19.603
(Telephone rings)

22:19.605 --> 22:23.441
Hi, Simon? Lisa George.

22:23.443 --> 22:26.610
I want to see
what's on that disc.

22:34.787 --> 22:36.887
(Metal clinks on glass)

22:36.889 --> 22:38.956
Everybody.

22:38.958 --> 22:41.926
Everybody.

22:41.928 --> 22:45.963
We are
gathered together tonight

22:45.965 --> 22:49.433
to celebrate our perseverance

22:49.435 --> 22:52.002
and to remind ourselves

22:52.004 --> 22:55.573
that we must never
take for granted

22:55.575 --> 22:58.976
our hard-earned...
Second chances.

23:02.648 --> 23:04.115
To Letitia's freedom.

23:04.117 --> 23:06.817
I'll drink to that.

23:06.819 --> 23:09.787
And to my princess Karen...
(Gasps)

23:09.789 --> 23:14.592
With a fifth
and, it is hoped, not final...

23:14.594 --> 23:16.794
Tripp.
Wedding forthcoming.

23:16.796 --> 23:18.896
Thanks, daddy.

23:18.898 --> 23:20.531
And to Patrick,

23:20.533 --> 23:23.534
who has weathered
this exceedingly difficult year

23:23.536 --> 23:26.937
and has found himself
in the United States senate.

23:26.939 --> 23:28.906
(Metal clinks on glass)

23:28.908 --> 23:31.208
You're one step closer
to Pennsylvania Avenue,

23:31.210 --> 23:34.512
and you're gonna get there
if you play your cards right.

23:34.514 --> 23:36.514
My cards
are my business, dad,

23:36.516 --> 23:39.116
but thanks
for the vote of confidence.

23:40.653 --> 23:41.952
To family.

23:41.954 --> 23:44.155
To family.
To family.

23:44.157 --> 23:46.123
To family.

23:47.860 --> 23:49.493
(Letitia) Nicky.

23:49.495 --> 23:50.995
(Nick) Yeah.

23:50.997 --> 23:53.697
Where's Lisa? I thought
you two were making a go of it.

23:53.699 --> 23:55.699
We are. She's moving
back in on Monday.

23:55.701 --> 23:57.701
But she and kiki are...

23:57.703 --> 24:00.037
Well, they're having
a girls' night.

24:00.039 --> 24:03.240
Oh. I can't tell you
how pleased I am to hear that.

24:03.242 --> 24:06.010
I wish my husband
had your same willingness

24:06.012 --> 24:08.212
to forgive and forget.

24:08.214 --> 24:11.949
Unfortunately, he's just
a little too enchanted

24:11.951 --> 24:15.519
by our... little con artist

24:15.521 --> 24:18.222
to realize
what he could lose,

24:18.224 --> 24:20.558
financially...

24:20.560 --> 24:22.893
And otherwise.

24:22.895 --> 24:25.029
(Elevator bell dings,
doors open)

24:27.233 --> 24:28.933
(Laughs)

24:28.935 --> 24:32.603
Oh, hello, Boris, Natasha.

24:32.605 --> 24:35.072
Say hello to Gabby
and portia.

24:35.074 --> 24:38.542
Back-up singers for the new song
J.T. And I just wrote.

24:38.544 --> 24:40.911
It's called "moving on."
(Chuckles)

24:40.913 --> 24:42.746
(Chuckles)

24:42.748 --> 24:45.216
You should get
the ring tone.

24:47.553 --> 24:50.020
Hey, Uncle Jeremy.
Hey, muchacho.

24:50.022 --> 24:51.989
Whoa, whoa. What do you
think you're doing?

24:51.991 --> 24:53.691
There's no alcohol for you.

24:53.693 --> 24:55.826
Excuse me?
Sorry. Not my rules.

24:55.828 --> 24:58.662
But the medical trial
has very strict requirements.

24:58.664 --> 25:01.031
You think
because I had sex with you,

25:01.033 --> 25:03.667
that means I changed my mind?

25:03.669 --> 25:05.669
You may find this
hard to believe, Brian,

25:05.671 --> 25:07.838
but the sex wasn't
<i> that</i> mind-altering.

25:07.840 --> 25:10.608
Well, then you tell our son
that you have the big "C"

25:10.610 --> 25:13.677
and that you're doing
nothing about it.

25:13.679 --> 25:15.946
And then afterwards, you two
can go coffin shopping.

25:15.948 --> 25:18.983
(Indistinct conversations)

25:18.985 --> 25:21.952
And here she is,
Ms. chief of staff.

25:21.954 --> 25:24.855
I wish Patrick
had given me more notice.

25:24.857 --> 25:26.757
I wasn't expecting that

25:26.759 --> 25:29.059
you'd attend a family dinner.

25:29.061 --> 25:30.961
Professional hazard.

25:30.963 --> 25:33.931
Despite what you <i> think,</i>
Ms. lyons,

25:33.933 --> 25:36.934
I harbor no ill will
towards you,

25:36.936 --> 25:39.637
and I hope you perform
your tasks for Patrick

25:39.639 --> 25:41.639
with the same...

25:41.641 --> 25:45.643
Single-mindedness with which
you prosecuted me.

25:45.645 --> 25:47.845
That's very gracious
of you.

25:47.847 --> 25:49.313
Oh, and I...

25:49.315 --> 25:53.150
I just hope that there
are no hard feelings

25:53.152 --> 25:57.154
about your...
Doomed relationship

25:57.156 --> 25:59.256
with my son...

25:59.258 --> 26:01.125
Jeremy.

26:01.127 --> 26:04.695
Yeah.<i> That</i> was my mistake.

26:04.697 --> 26:06.297
Oh, no, dear.

26:06.299 --> 26:10.000
That was <i> no</i> mistake,

26:10.002 --> 26:13.137
not at all.

26:21.080 --> 26:24.214
Agriculture?
It'll set you back years.

26:24.216 --> 26:27.084
I c--I can't believe
you're even considering it.

26:27.086 --> 26:29.386
I'm doing more
than considering, dad.

26:29.388 --> 26:31.889
I've made up my mind.

26:31.891 --> 26:34.325
It's that woman.

26:34.327 --> 26:37.895
That woman's influence
is destroying you.

26:37.897 --> 26:41.765
It has nothing to do
with her.

26:41.767 --> 26:44.001
Have you asked yourself

26:44.003 --> 26:47.738
exactly what it is
she wants from you?
Maybe she's the only one

26:47.740 --> 26:49.740
that doesn't want something
from me, dad.

26:49.742 --> 26:51.141
Ever consider that?

26:51.143 --> 26:53.844
Now I like
what you just said in there

26:53.846 --> 26:55.245
about second chances.

26:55.247 --> 26:58.148
Why don't you take
your own advice

26:58.150 --> 27:00.951
and support me for a change?

27:00.953 --> 27:04.021
(Door closes)

27:06.859 --> 27:08.158
Hey there.

27:08.160 --> 27:10.227
Look at you.
Hey.

27:10.229 --> 27:11.929
How's the boarder?

27:11.931 --> 27:13.931
Far from bored.

27:13.933 --> 27:17.901
Karen lent me this dress.
I think it goes for 10 grand.

27:17.903 --> 27:19.303
Nice.

27:19.305 --> 27:22.306
It must be strange for you.

27:22.308 --> 27:24.108
How so?

27:24.110 --> 27:27.144
Just being around this
all the time.

27:27.146 --> 27:31.015
Yeah, yeah.
Definitely strange.

27:31.017 --> 27:32.383
You're married, right?

27:32.385 --> 27:34.084
(Elevator bell dings)

27:34.086 --> 27:35.753
I am, yeah.

27:35.755 --> 27:37.054
So where's your wife?

27:37.056 --> 27:40.224
She's right here.
Lisa, what are you doing here?

27:40.226 --> 27:42.993
Simon showed me the disc.
Look, Lisa, I can't do this
right now.

27:42.995 --> 27:45.229
You can and you will.
Lisa. Just--I was--I was--

27:45.231 --> 27:46.930
you lied to me.
Keep it down.

27:46.932 --> 27:48.932
You said you were working
when you went to see Karen?

27:48.934 --> 27:52.002
You went out there to see
if she was still

27:52.004 --> 27:53.303
pathetically waiting for you.

27:53.305 --> 27:56.140
Was she?
Are you two finally on?
Calm down.

27:56.142 --> 27:58.142
Because if that's what you
want--that slut, that rich,

27:58.144 --> 28:00.277
disgusting string bean
made of money, then have her.

28:00.279 --> 28:02.513
She's waiting for you.
She is wide-open.

28:02.515 --> 28:05.482
Hi, Lisa. I smell trouble.
Or is that your perfume?
Karen.

28:05.484 --> 28:07.351
Hmm?
Walk away.

28:07.353 --> 28:10.888
Sweetie, if I do that,
he's just gonna look at my ass.

28:10.890 --> 28:12.990
(Laughs)
You can't resist.

28:12.992 --> 28:15.526
You will not be happy until
you see our relationship die,

28:15.528 --> 28:18.128
will you?
Well, he certainly won't.

28:18.130 --> 28:21.098
You stupid, slutty bitch.

28:21.100 --> 28:22.866
(Gasps)
Lisa, what the hell?!

28:22.868 --> 28:25.869
Oh, no, no, no. You and I have
never been in the same class,

28:25.871 --> 28:28.872
but I'm not afraid
to fight above my weight.

28:28.874 --> 28:31.341
Oh, honey, I'll kick your ass
if I can find it.
Hey.

28:31.343 --> 28:33.043
Oh, bring it.

28:33.045 --> 28:35.112
<i>Now</i> it's family night.

28:35.114 --> 28:37.181
I've always wanted
to do this.

28:37.183 --> 28:38.482
Oh!

28:38.484 --> 28:40.818
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Lisa.
Oh, hell, no!

28:40.820 --> 28:42.953
Whatever you think happened,
it was not her fault!

28:42.955 --> 28:46.090
I know what I saw, Nick!
Why don't you back off
and listen to her for once?!

28:46.092 --> 28:48.859
Hey, why don't you back off,
fauntleroy?

28:48.861 --> 28:51.395
This is none of your business.
You know what? I think it is!

28:51.397 --> 28:54.031
Lisa's been pretty cool
with all your little head games,

28:54.033 --> 28:57.334
but even an art chick
has got limits.
Who the hell are you
to talk to me that way?

28:57.336 --> 29:00.137
(Jeremy)
I'm your worst nightmare.
Shut the hell up, both of you!

29:00.139 --> 29:02.139
Just let the bitch be.

29:05.177 --> 29:07.211
(Indistinct conversations)

29:07.213 --> 29:08.946
Lisa...

29:08.948 --> 29:11.448
When we first moved back
to New York,

29:11.450 --> 29:14.351
and your father, he offered
to help us out, you said no.

29:14.353 --> 29:18.355
No. We were gonna make it
on our own.

29:18.357 --> 29:20.357
Is this what you had in mind?

29:20.359 --> 29:22.426
Because I think...

29:22.428 --> 29:25.129
This is...
Where you were meant to be,

29:25.131 --> 29:27.131
<i>who</i> you were meant to be
all along,

29:27.133 --> 29:29.967
and now I am just a reminder
of that time you spent

29:29.969 --> 29:33.003
pretending to be
something else.

29:33.005 --> 29:35.072
I'm done.

29:35.074 --> 29:37.141
It's over.

29:40.246 --> 29:43.580
I know.

29:52.024 --> 29:54.558
(Nola)
Talk about your setups.

29:54.560 --> 29:57.427
So your mother was behind
our entire relationship?

29:57.429 --> 29:59.263
No, I'm telling you,

29:59.265 --> 30:02.065
she found out
we were seeing each other,

30:02.067 --> 30:05.202
and she told me
to keep it going.
Yeah, and you just
went along with it?

30:05.204 --> 30:08.205
You were trying to send her
to the electric chair.
She used you.

30:08.207 --> 30:10.307
That's part
of being a darling,

30:10.309 --> 30:13.010
which you seem to have
pretty down yourself.
What? What are you
talking about?

30:13.012 --> 30:15.979
You're using Patrick.
For what?

30:15.981 --> 30:18.215
To get close to me
because you still love me.

30:18.217 --> 30:21.618
Okay, you know, whatever
you need to tell yourself.

30:21.620 --> 30:23.620
Tell me you don't
think about me...

30:23.622 --> 30:25.622
When you take your dress off

30:25.624 --> 30:27.624
at the end of a long,
boring day

30:27.626 --> 30:31.061
or when you're in the shower
with no one to soap your back

30:31.063 --> 30:33.063
or in the early morning
when you're all sleepy

30:33.065 --> 30:37.100
and you roll over.

30:37.102 --> 30:39.169
(Clears throat)

30:39.171 --> 30:40.671
Ready to go?

30:40.673 --> 30:43.006
Yes.

30:43.008 --> 30:45.008
I am ready.

30:46.946 --> 30:48.645
Night.

30:54.019 --> 30:55.986
(Laughs)

30:55.988 --> 30:58.488
You picked out
your soft P.J.S, huh?

30:58.490 --> 31:00.190
(Chuckles) Yeah.

31:00.192 --> 31:02.192
So you have fun tonight?

31:02.194 --> 31:05.028
Uh-huh.
Uncle Jeremy's funny.

31:05.030 --> 31:06.997
(Chuckles) Yeah.

31:11.270 --> 31:14.037
You know I love you...

31:14.039 --> 31:16.173
So very much?

31:16.175 --> 31:20.077
(Kisses)
You're my sweet angel.

31:22.114 --> 31:24.715
Sweet dreams, baby.

31:35.995 --> 31:37.995
I thought
you were gonna tell him

31:37.997 --> 31:40.297
instead of just talking about
my brother's comedic chops.

31:40.299 --> 31:44.067
I changed my mind, Brian.
I'm gonna do the trial.

31:44.069 --> 31:46.069
Since when?

31:46.071 --> 31:48.038
Since tonight.

31:48.040 --> 31:50.540
After that dinner,
I realized there is no way

31:50.542 --> 31:55.612
I can leave my son alone
with you and your family.

31:55.614 --> 31:57.748
I actually <i> have</i> to live.

31:57.750 --> 32:01.084
(Pinback's "loro" playing)

32:04.590 --> 32:09.026
♪♪

32:10.362 --> 32:12.162
Hey.

32:12.164 --> 32:13.163
Hey.

32:13.165 --> 32:14.564
You all right?

32:14.566 --> 32:16.066
Believe it or not,

32:16.068 --> 32:18.068
this is pretty much

anyone like that.

I grew up just assuming

Life, I guess.

Karen broke off
our engagement,

35:01.333 --> 35:05.202
and I went back to college,
where I met Lisa.

35:05.204 --> 35:09.206
And I have spent the rest of
my life caught between them--

35:09.208 --> 35:11.641
Lisa, Karen, Karen and Lisa--
and now...

35:11.643 --> 35:13.844
You think you've lost
both of them.

35:13.846 --> 35:15.545
Yeah.

35:15.547 --> 35:17.180
Well, I doubt that.

35:17.182 --> 35:20.784
You're not the kind of guy
women get over easily.

35:20.786 --> 35:24.221
Even just knowing you two days,
I can see that.

35:30.896 --> 35:34.464
I think I'm gonna go to bed.

35:34.466 --> 35:36.466
It's, uh,
probably my last night

35:36.468 --> 35:37.934
on 1,000-count sheets, so...

35:37.936 --> 35:39.803
Yeah,
you gotta take advantage.

35:39.805 --> 35:41.839
Yeah.

35:41.840 --> 35:43.874
Did it ever occur to you
that neither Karen nor Lisa

35:43.876 --> 35:46.476
were the right person
for you?

35:46.478 --> 35:49.546
The crazy truth is, no.

35:49.548 --> 35:51.548
I have never thought that.

35:51.550 --> 35:53.817
Well, that's too bad.

35:53.819 --> 35:56.653
'Cause there might be
other options.

36:16.542 --> 36:21.011
I feel like I can breathe
for the first time in years.

36:21.013 --> 36:22.712
Must be nice.

36:22.714 --> 36:24.281
Oh, yeah.

36:24.283 --> 36:27.017
You have
no idea what it's like

36:27.019 --> 36:29.019
to be under someone's thumb.

36:29.021 --> 36:31.855
(Sighs) Look, I'm, uh,
I'm grateful to you

36:31.857 --> 36:34.691
for wanting to be
my chief of staff,

36:34.693 --> 36:37.627
even though...

36:37.629 --> 36:41.498
I know
why you're doing this.

36:43.302 --> 36:46.369
You want to be close
to Jeremy.

36:46.371 --> 36:48.004
It's okay.

36:48.006 --> 36:51.441
Neither of us can be with
the person we really want.

36:51.443 --> 36:55.011
(Chuckles) That's one thing
we have in common.

36:55.013 --> 36:56.513
Uh, this is me.

36:56.515 --> 36:58.014
Good night.

36:58.016 --> 37:01.451
Good night.
And thank you.

37:01.453 --> 37:02.953
For what?

37:04.656 --> 37:06.856
For being you.

37:13.765 --> 37:15.966
That's a surprise.

37:15.968 --> 37:17.934
Little paddy
stuck up for himself.

37:17.936 --> 37:19.970
(Laughs)
Yep.

37:19.972 --> 37:22.973
And he's taking the open seat
on the agricultural committee.

37:22.975 --> 37:24.674
Nicely done.

37:24.676 --> 37:26.977
Simon...
I can't go through with this.

37:26.979 --> 37:28.979
Hmm?

37:28.981 --> 37:33.617
It's just that I'm getting...
Too involved--

37:33.619 --> 37:35.619
oh, don't tell me
you're having regrets

37:35.621 --> 37:36.987
about your little boyfriend.

37:36.989 --> 37:38.989
Look, Patrick is already
completely dependent on me,

37:38.991 --> 37:41.625
Letitia is evil,
and your girlfriend Karen is,

37:41.627 --> 37:44.094
you know, part psychopath,
and if they find out--
oh, you know, I...

37:44.096 --> 37:47.964
I'm sorry. I forgot. I-I had
something I had to show you.

37:47.966 --> 37:48.999
What?

37:49.001 --> 37:50.900
Come here.
Nola, come here.

37:50.902 --> 37:52.769
Don't.
Come here!

37:52.771 --> 37:54.971
Don't!
Now!

38:06.084 --> 38:08.752
<i> Hi, Simon.</i>

38:08.754 --> 38:10.720
They tell me...

38:10.722 --> 38:12.722
That when he wakes up
in the morning,

38:12.724 --> 38:17.694
there's still only one person
he asks for.

38:17.696 --> 38:20.830
Isn't that something?

38:20.832 --> 38:22.866
<i> Simon, they're fishes.</i>

38:22.868 --> 38:26.002
<i> Tell my sister</i>
<i> I made them for her</i>

38:26.004 --> 38:28.004
<i> and give her my kisses. Bye!</i>

38:28.006 --> 38:30.874
Just tell me.
Where's my brother?

38:30.876 --> 38:33.877
He's fine.
He's well taken care of.

38:33.879 --> 38:37.681
When is this done?
When is this gonna be done?
Listen, don't you ever forget

38:37.683 --> 38:41.084
all the things I've done
for you, nola lyons.

38:41.086 --> 38:42.619
Hey.

38:45.424 --> 38:47.157
Hey, hey, hey.

38:47.159 --> 38:48.992
Hmm?

38:48.994 --> 38:51.695
Who's my little soldier?

38:51.697 --> 38:53.697
Don't touch me.

38:56.001 --> 38:58.668
(Simon laughs)

38:58.670 --> 39:00.970
(Tripp) Nick.

39:00.972 --> 39:03.440
You're leaving
without saying good-bye.

39:03.442 --> 39:05.075
Hey, Tripp.

39:05.077 --> 39:06.943
Quite a night, huh?

39:06.945 --> 39:08.812
Oh, yeah, always.
Uh-huh.

39:08.814 --> 39:11.114
How's Karen?
Oh, well...

39:11.116 --> 39:14.517
She's licked her wounds,
and she's resting comfortably.

39:14.519 --> 39:17.921
My ferocious little girl.

39:17.923 --> 39:21.124
And--and Wrenn,
how's Wrenn?

39:21.126 --> 39:24.861
Well, I don't think she's gonna
tell anybody about the accident.

39:24.863 --> 39:27.864
As soon as she's feeling better,
we'll send her on her way.

39:27.866 --> 39:30.600
Probably tomorrow.
She's a lovely girl,
isn't she?

39:30.602 --> 39:32.502
She is.

39:32.504 --> 39:35.905
You know, my whole life...

39:35.907 --> 39:39.175
I thought of Letitia

39:39.177 --> 39:42.746
as the only woman that I
could ever be happy with.

39:44.983 --> 39:48.852
Perhaps I was mistaken.

39:48.854 --> 39:50.887
(Elevator bell dings)

39:50.889 --> 39:52.922
Good night, Tripp.

39:52.924 --> 39:54.591
Good night, Nick.

39:54.593 --> 39:56.526
Thank you.

40:10.175 --> 40:12.242
So what
can I do for you now?

40:12.244 --> 40:16.146
Are you here
to see Karen... again?
I'm here for you.

40:16.148 --> 40:19.516
You recording this in case
you want to watch it later?

40:19.518 --> 40:22.085
I know that's your thing.
What's up, Nick? It's late.

40:22.087 --> 40:24.087
When I first
started working for Tripp,

40:24.089 --> 40:26.222
he told me you were the enemy.

40:26.224 --> 40:29.092
And I thought, no,
he's not such a bad guy.

40:29.094 --> 40:31.694
He just does things differently,
you know, old money, new money.

40:31.696 --> 40:33.696
But after seeing
what you're willing to do

40:33.698 --> 40:35.765
to get what you want,
I've learned something.

40:35.767 --> 40:38.034
No one has to pay me
to destroy you.

40:38.036 --> 40:40.270
I'm more than happy
to do it for free.

40:40.272 --> 40:42.238
Wow. Did you rehearse that?

40:42.240 --> 40:44.841
I mean, 'cause I like it.

40:44.843 --> 40:47.143
I like this new Nick
'cause he's waking up.

40:47.145 --> 40:49.946
He's starting to think
for himself.

40:49.948 --> 40:52.515
Soon
you'll start to realize,

40:52.517 --> 40:54.551
we're not that different,
you and me.
Oh, yes, we are.

40:54.553 --> 40:57.720
And I just want you to know,
Nick, if this <i> is</i> about Karen,

40:57.722 --> 41:00.723
don't worry. You can
have her back when I'm done.

41:00.725 --> 41:02.926
You son of a bitch!
(Man speaks Russian)

41:02.928 --> 41:04.961
(Speaks Russian)

41:04.963 --> 41:06.696
Nick...

41:06.698 --> 41:09.032
I've got no problem
with you.

41:09.034 --> 41:11.267
You didn't.

41:11.269 --> 41:14.971
But you do now.

41:16.775 --> 41:19.042
(Scoffs)
