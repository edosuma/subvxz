00:42.280 --> 00:44.200
Wouldn't it be great to be a police witch?

00:44.480 --> 00:46.080
I can see you in the flying squad.

00:47.120 --> 00:49.800
And how would you describe
your mum's celebrity lifestyle?

00:50.120 --> 00:53.080
It's fabulous, exciting...

00:53.400 --> 00:54.400
Trashy.

00:55.040 --> 00:58.280
I still can't believe the famous
Narcissus Nightshade's going to be here

00:58.560 --> 00:59.880
at our Careers Evening.

01:00.680 --> 01:03.120
You shouldn't confuse fame with success.

01:03.360 --> 01:06.800
- Enid's mother has one, mine the other.
- Put a cork in it, Ethel!

01:07.520 --> 01:10.320
Is that everything, Felicity?
Only I promised I'd give my mum a call.

01:10.400 --> 01:12.560
That's fantastic. Thanks, Enid.

01:12.880 --> 01:15.120
I'll post this on <i>The Daily Bubble</i>
straightaway.

01:16.880 --> 01:18.720
You should interview me, Felice.

01:20.120 --> 01:22.840
My mother's got the most impressive CV.

01:23.240 --> 01:28.080
Education Minister at the Magic Council,
wife, mother, Hallow.

01:28.560 --> 01:31.800
I thought she wasn't speaking to you
after what happened with Esmerelda?

01:31.880 --> 01:34.080
Yes, well, that's about to change.

01:34.600 --> 01:37.640
I'll introduce her on stage tomorrow,
say how proud I am,

01:37.720 --> 01:39.960
how I can't wait to follow
in her boot steps.

01:40.520 --> 01:42.360
Then it's time for phase two.

01:48.680 --> 01:50.640
<i>Enid! It's great to see you.</i>

01:51.640 --> 01:53.640
- Where are you?
<i>- Backstage.</i>

01:53.720 --> 01:55.520
<i>Preparing for tomorrow night's show.</i>

01:55.880 --> 01:56.880
Tomorrow night?

01:57.160 --> 02:00.920
<i>"Narcissus and Nathaniel Nightshade,
everyone's preferred poison".</i>

02:01.000 --> 02:02.280
But it's my Careers Evening.

02:02.840 --> 02:04.960
<i>No, that's not tomorrow, sweetheart,
that's next week.</i>

02:05.040 --> 02:08.919
Then why have I been decorating
the school, getting everything ready?

02:10.039 --> 02:13.400
<i>I'd forget my head
if it wasn't screwed on.</i>

02:13.480 --> 02:15.040
<i>I'm so, so sorry.</i>

02:16.960 --> 02:19.640
- So, your mum's definitely coming?
- Yep.

02:20.320 --> 02:21.840
She took a lot of persuading.

02:21.920 --> 02:24.800
She's convinced no one's interested
in her non-magical career.

02:25.320 --> 02:28.080
- That's daft. She's brilliant at her job.
- I know.

02:28.840 --> 02:30.200
I can't wait to show her off.

02:37.200 --> 02:40.280
Enid? What's the matter?

02:41.280 --> 02:43.400
My mum's got a show booked
for tomorrow night.

02:44.200 --> 02:45.200
She can't come.

02:45.840 --> 02:47.960
- You're kidding!
- Do I look like I'm kidding?

02:49.360 --> 02:50.880
She's always busy working.

02:51.760 --> 02:54.760
Don't worry,
I'm sure you'll be in trouble again soon.

02:55.120 --> 02:56.680
Then she'll have to come and visit.

02:56.880 --> 02:59.840
Yeah. She never misses an opportunity
to tell me off.

03:18.360 --> 03:20.000
Hurry up, girls!

03:20.080 --> 03:23.800
That includes you, Maud Spellbody.

03:26.960 --> 03:29.360
- Is it breakfast time already?
- Nowhere near.

03:29.720 --> 03:30.720
Another fire drill?

03:31.320 --> 03:32.760
No fire without smoke.

03:33.920 --> 03:35.760
There's Enid.
Maybe she knows something.

03:36.920 --> 03:38.920
Single file, ladies!

03:47.040 --> 03:49.080
I've brought you all here today

03:49.160 --> 03:52.240
because I wanted you to see this vile

03:52.320 --> 03:56.320
and despicable act for yourselves.

04:00.760 --> 04:04.720
Not only was this a childish
and pointless prank,

04:05.080 --> 04:06.920
but Miss Tapioca was so shocked

04:07.000 --> 04:10.600
that she dropped
her prized porridge-making pot.

04:10.680 --> 04:12.560
Alas, poor Percy.

04:13.560 --> 04:14.800
I knew him well.

04:16.160 --> 04:17.760
Is there something funny, Beatrice?

04:18.240 --> 04:19.959
No, Miss Tapioca.

04:20.040 --> 04:22.000
No, indeed.

04:23.200 --> 04:26.720
Perhaps the guilty party
would care to step forward

04:26.920 --> 04:29.120
and take responsibility for the...

04:31.960 --> 04:34.160
Enid Nightshade.

04:34.600 --> 04:37.920
I might have known you'd be behind
this half-witted jape.

04:38.200 --> 04:41.200
Do you have anything to say for yourself?

04:41.800 --> 04:43.000
No, Miss Hardbroom.

04:43.320 --> 04:45.120
No excuses?

04:45.200 --> 04:48.000
- No grovelling apology?
- Nope.

04:50.480 --> 04:56.600
All second-years, get dressed
and return to clear up this mess.

04:57.120 --> 05:00.320
And you are to report
to Miss Cackle's office

05:00.400 --> 05:02.480
the moment you've finished.

05:03.360 --> 05:06.480
Prepare for the worst.

05:13.160 --> 05:17.080
Enid Nightshade's so brave,
so daring, so...

05:17.160 --> 05:18.360
Stupidly silly.

05:18.440 --> 05:20.120
She's not in the slightest bit silly.

05:20.200 --> 05:22.680
But what's the point of toilet papering
the Great Hall?

05:23.560 --> 05:24.560
There isn't one.

05:24.800 --> 05:28.040
It's a prank, a trick, a practical joke.

05:28.120 --> 05:29.360
It's hardly practical.

05:29.440 --> 05:32.120
Haven't you ever pulled a prank before?
It's funny.

05:33.400 --> 05:35.800
I'd rather do something constructive
with my time.

05:36.280 --> 05:37.280
You mean boring.

05:37.680 --> 05:39.400
Only boring people get bored.

05:42.160 --> 05:44.560
- I hope you're pleased with yourself.
- Yes, thanks.

05:44.640 --> 05:48.520
This has got to be the dumbest prank ever.
Completely pointless.

05:49.400 --> 05:51.040
Touchy or what?

05:51.320 --> 05:53.040
I don't know. I sort of agree.

05:53.520 --> 05:55.560
- Come on, Millie. It was your idea.
- Was it?

05:56.720 --> 05:58.360
I don't remember.

05:58.440 --> 06:01.680
You said I'd be in trouble again soon
and Mum would have to visit.

06:02.760 --> 06:03.840
Right, but...

06:03.920 --> 06:07.320
So I got in trouble just in time
for Careers Night and now she has to come.

06:07.400 --> 06:09.160
Aren't you worried
what Miss Cackle will say?

06:09.240 --> 06:12.760
My folks will just sign a few autographs,
pay for any damage,

06:12.920 --> 06:14.840
then they'll be the shining stars
of the evening.

06:15.160 --> 06:16.960
- Do you really think so?
- Absolutely.

06:17.040 --> 06:18.680
Everything's going totally to plan.

06:22.680 --> 06:26.440
The girl thinks she can coast through life
on a silver broomstick.

06:26.720 --> 06:27.840
She makes no effort.

06:28.160 --> 06:31.760
She's selfish, irresponsible...

06:32.520 --> 06:34.160
Be firm, Ada.

06:35.280 --> 06:36.280
I intend to be.

06:40.560 --> 06:41.560
Enid.

06:42.800 --> 06:43.800
Have a seat.

06:46.360 --> 06:48.800
We've just been speaking
to your mother and father.

06:50.880 --> 06:53.520
They were very disappointed
when they heard what you'd done.

06:53.600 --> 06:56.000
- Are they coming?
- They are not.

06:56.760 --> 06:59.560
The same applies
to your classmates' parents.

07:00.320 --> 07:02.600
I'm sorry, Miss Hardbroom,
I don't understand.

07:02.680 --> 07:05.360
As a result of your actions,

07:05.440 --> 07:07.920
tonight's Careers Event
has been cancelled.

07:08.320 --> 07:10.136
Oh, no, Miss Hardbroom.
Please, please don't do that.

07:10.160 --> 07:11.376
Everyone will be so disappointed.

07:11.400 --> 07:13.240
It's been decided.

07:14.000 --> 07:17.720
If you could make the necessary calls
and announcements, Miss Hardbroom?

07:23.440 --> 07:25.840
Every choice you make has a consequence.

07:26.600 --> 07:29.200
Today, you've shown
a lack of respect for me,

07:29.840 --> 07:32.880
for the school, for your fellow witches.

07:33.520 --> 07:36.280
I'm so sorry, Miss Cackle.
I can do better. I know I can.

07:37.760 --> 07:39.720
I'm making today an Assessment Day,

07:40.520 --> 07:45.120
and I'll be asking the teachers to pay
particular attention to your performance.

07:45.200 --> 07:46.240
If you fail to impress,

07:47.880 --> 07:49.800
then I'll have to consider
your future here.

07:50.720 --> 07:51.720
What do you mean?

07:52.720 --> 07:56.160
I cannot and will not tolerate
wilfully wayward witches

07:56.240 --> 07:57.320
at Cackle's Academy.

07:59.160 --> 08:01.480
Mum was bringing
homemade shortbread.

08:01.760 --> 08:03.320
I cleared my tuck box already.

08:04.200 --> 08:05.720
I should probably speak to my mum.

08:05.920 --> 08:08.960
She's so paranoid, she'll think
it's just her they're disinviting.

08:09.600 --> 08:11.040
Did Miss Hardbroom speak to you?

08:12.360 --> 08:15.240
No Careers Evening
and an Assessment Day.

08:15.600 --> 08:17.320
With no time to revise.

08:18.160 --> 08:19.440
Does everybody hate me?

08:20.840 --> 08:22.560
I really wanted Mum to shine.

08:23.840 --> 08:26.840
- Some witches are so selfish.
- I didn't mean for this to happen.

08:26.920 --> 08:28.200
It's so unfair!

08:28.280 --> 08:30.160
Why are we being punished
for something you did?

08:30.240 --> 08:32.000
If it helps, I'm being punished more.

08:32.080 --> 08:33.280
Yeah? How?

08:33.360 --> 08:36.400
Miss Cackle said she's going to expel me
if I don't pass today's assessments.

08:36.480 --> 08:39.280
Good. I'm glad.
I hope you don't.

08:39.600 --> 08:40.600
Come on, Felicity.

08:44.320 --> 08:45.800
I'd better go and talk to Mum.

08:51.200 --> 08:52.960
She's really upset, isn't she?

08:54.400 --> 08:55.400
We all are.

08:59.160 --> 09:03.520
I once gave my brother
a toffee onion instead of a toffee apple.

09:03.840 --> 09:06.400
- Ugh!
- How completely absurd.

09:06.800 --> 09:09.080
My friend Tempest
taught her parrot to say,

09:09.360 --> 09:11.280
"Help! I've been turned into a parrot!"

09:13.120 --> 09:14.960
How utterly featherbrained.

09:16.080 --> 09:17.080
What am I missing?

09:17.440 --> 09:21.120
A sense of humour.
Sorry, Clarice, you just don't get it.

09:21.720 --> 09:24.800
That's not possible, I get everything.
Even fractions.

09:28.600 --> 09:32.800
So, no Narcissus Nightshade interview.
Your readers will be disappointed.

09:33.040 --> 09:34.720
They'll probably think you made it all up.

09:34.800 --> 09:36.800
I'd better not lose any followers
over this.

09:37.120 --> 09:38.760
And what about your mum's introduction?

09:38.840 --> 09:41.320
Enid's ruined everything for both of us.

09:41.640 --> 09:43.320
She deserves to be punished.

09:43.400 --> 09:44.440
What can we do?

09:45.440 --> 09:47.560
We can make sure she fails
all her assessments.

09:48.440 --> 09:51.280
I've got the perfect potions
for a pitiful performance.

09:54.000 --> 09:55.080
Did you hear that?

09:56.440 --> 09:57.440
It came from up there.

10:09.120 --> 10:11.560
Mildred Hubble!
You weren't earwigging, were you?

10:13.240 --> 10:16.440
Not on purpose,
but I heard everything you said,

10:16.520 --> 10:18.480
and you'd better leave Enid alone!

10:19.040 --> 10:20.840
I'm sorry, I can't do that.

10:21.240 --> 10:24.800
And I can't have you warning her
about our little plan either, so...

10:27.000 --> 10:30.640
Door hinges obey this spell,
stick fast, stick well!

10:33.040 --> 10:34.280
Let me out!

10:34.680 --> 10:36.000
Ethel! Felicity!

10:36.080 --> 10:38.680
If you can't stir with the big girls,
stay away from the cauldron.

10:38.720 --> 10:40.080
Don't do this!

10:40.480 --> 10:41.480
Stop! Wait!

10:41.760 --> 10:46.880
In my opinion, creativity should never be
graded or assessed, but...

10:48.800 --> 10:51.640
let's make today "Inspiration Day."

10:52.080 --> 10:58.240
I want you to paint, or draw, or sketch,
or etch something important to you.

10:58.320 --> 11:00.560
Something that inspires you.

11:01.320 --> 11:05.800
But before you mini maestros begin,
we're missing Mildred Hubble.

11:07.080 --> 11:09.920
- Uh, she's on her way.
- Well...

11:10.320 --> 11:13.080
better late than never,
but never late is better.

11:14.200 --> 11:16.560
Would it be okay if I drew my mother,
Miss Mould?

11:17.040 --> 11:19.520
She's my biggest inspiration, you see.

11:19.880 --> 11:22.040
Of course. Good idea, Ethel.

11:22.640 --> 11:25.440
We all thought we'd be seeing
our parents this evening.

11:26.000 --> 11:27.040
Yes, indeed.

11:27.840 --> 11:28.840
Such a pity.

11:29.760 --> 11:34.480
Now, if you want to impress me,
think bold, think bright, think big!

11:35.120 --> 11:36.120
Well, let's begin.

11:39.560 --> 11:40.560
What should I draw?

11:41.880 --> 11:43.880
That's up to you.
Just do the best you can.

11:46.600 --> 11:48.120
Help, somebody!

11:49.400 --> 11:50.400
Anybody!

11:54.840 --> 11:57.840
Oh, Tabby, I've got to get out
and warn Enid about their plan.

12:14.040 --> 12:15.040
Of course.

12:18.000 --> 12:21.360
That's it, painters.
Time to put down your brushes.

12:23.280 --> 12:25.320
Gosh, is it the end of class already?

12:25.880 --> 12:27.400
Time flies when you're having fun.

12:29.080 --> 12:30.560
I hope Mildred's okay.

12:30.640 --> 12:33.280
I suppose you'll have to report
her absence to Miss Cackle.

12:33.840 --> 12:36.240
Oh, right. Yes, I suppose so.

12:37.800 --> 12:40.680
Perhaps you could add
a little more colour next time, Ethel.

12:43.080 --> 12:47.040
If she thinks that's bad,
wait till she sees Enid's abomination.

12:47.120 --> 12:49.320
Glorious, Maud! Regal.

12:49.400 --> 12:52.440
Eye of newt and guppy's gill.
Paint tumble, paint spill.

12:56.120 --> 12:58.240
Now, then, Miss Nightshade...

12:58.320 --> 12:59.800
I'm so sorry, Miss Mould.

12:59.880 --> 13:00.880
Goodness me.

13:01.120 --> 13:02.200
I... It's...

13:02.560 --> 13:05.240
That is completely and utterly...

13:05.800 --> 13:06.800
original!

13:07.440 --> 13:11.000
The sunset here at Cackle's
is so wonderfully inspiring, isn't it?

13:17.120 --> 13:21.320
Wings like a bird, body of a rat.

13:22.280 --> 13:24.640
No longer human, now a bat!

13:26.040 --> 13:27.320
No, no. That's not right.

13:27.800 --> 13:31.000
Come on, Mildred. Think! Think!

13:33.680 --> 13:38.640
Body of a mouse, wings of a gnat.

13:38.720 --> 13:40.960
No longer human, now a bat!

13:42.640 --> 13:44.240
I can fly! Whoops!

13:44.320 --> 13:45.760
I can fly!

13:46.120 --> 13:48.600
Shh! The others are sleeping!

13:49.160 --> 13:50.160
Sorry!

13:50.240 --> 13:52.520
What part of "shh" don't you understand?

13:53.000 --> 13:55.080
I've got to go. Come on!

13:56.600 --> 13:59.040
Why are we going outside?
It's daytime.

13:59.960 --> 14:02.760
- Oh, well. Wait for me!
- Now, where was I going?

14:04.840 --> 14:05.880
Millie!

14:05.960 --> 14:07.520
- Mildred?
- Millie?

14:07.600 --> 14:08.640
- Mildred!
- Millie!

14:10.120 --> 14:12.160
Where is she?
We've looked everywhere.

14:13.040 --> 14:14.640
She said she had to talk to her mum.

14:16.040 --> 14:19.000
- Maybe she meant face-to-face?
- Millie wouldn't do that.

14:19.400 --> 14:21.096
She was really looking forward
to seeing her.

14:21.120 --> 14:23.280
She might have sneaked out
and gone home.

14:23.600 --> 14:26.600
- Ember Toadflax?
- Here, Miss.

14:28.800 --> 14:30.880
Well, we're still one witch wanting.

14:31.680 --> 14:32.960
Where's Mildred Hubble?

14:33.040 --> 14:34.880
- She's got a cold.
- She's got a cough.

14:34.960 --> 14:35.960
Right, I see.

14:36.000 --> 14:38.600
We'll just mark her as absent for now,
shall we?

14:39.840 --> 14:44.560
I want you front and centre today,
Miss Nightshade.

14:45.880 --> 14:49.120
Let's kick off with a protection chant.

14:49.760 --> 14:53.160
Exactly what we need
if the flu is flying around.

14:54.400 --> 14:56.040
I'll just find my music.

15:02.240 --> 15:06.960
Puerile prankster, the class clown,
remember this chant upside down!

15:11.640 --> 15:15.000
<i>- ♪ Skies and birds above my head ♪
- ♪ Birds and skies head my above ♪</i>

15:15.720 --> 15:16.960
Let's try that again.

15:18.280 --> 15:22.000
<i>- ♪ Skies and birds above my head ♪
- ♪ Birds and skies head my above ♪</i>

15:22.560 --> 15:25.840
On your own, Enid Nightshade.

15:26.200 --> 15:30.120
<i>♪ Birds and skies head my above ♪</i>

15:30.200 --> 15:33.280
Why do you insist on chanting it
back to front?

15:33.600 --> 15:35.400
I'm sorry, Miss Bat. I can't help it.

15:35.480 --> 15:36.480
Is that so?

15:37.880 --> 15:40.080
In that case, I can't help but fail you.

15:46.080 --> 15:47.440
Bea! She's over here.

15:49.920 --> 15:51.800
Do you want to play bat's cradle with us?

15:51.880 --> 15:53.640
- I can't. I'm busy.
- With what?

15:54.480 --> 15:56.120
Just homework and stuff.

15:57.080 --> 16:00.480
We've been looking for you for ages.
Don't you just want to hang out with us?

16:01.080 --> 16:02.520
I do. It's just, I'm busy.

16:03.520 --> 16:05.680
A busy, busy bee, that's me.

16:08.720 --> 16:10.640
Whoo-hoo! Whoops.

16:10.720 --> 16:13.720
You should go back inside.
You're supposed to be asleep.

16:13.800 --> 16:16.000
Sleep is for sissies! Whee!

16:16.080 --> 16:19.000
- Right. We can nap later.
- Whee-hee!

16:19.080 --> 16:23.320
- Wait! Was I going somewhere?
- Upside down and downside up!

16:23.400 --> 16:25.760
There was definitely something
I needed to remember.

16:25.840 --> 16:28.080
- Remembering isn't what we do.
- Why not?

16:28.160 --> 16:29.520
Because we're batty!

16:29.600 --> 16:32.320
We rock and we ramble,
our minds are a shamble.

16:32.400 --> 16:35.360
We're bat-brained
and our brains are scrambled.

16:38.080 --> 16:40.600
I thought you'd be up here
feeling sorry for yourself.

16:40.680 --> 16:41.680
Can you blame me?

16:42.120 --> 16:43.120
I can, actually.

16:43.600 --> 16:45.920
I don't know what happened
in chanting, but I promise...

16:46.000 --> 16:48.440
Mildred's heartbroken
because of what you did.

16:49.080 --> 16:51.800
- You could both end up getting expelled.
- What?

16:51.880 --> 16:54.280
If Miss Cackle finds out
she left the grounds.

16:54.360 --> 16:55.920
I recognise that sound.

16:56.000 --> 16:59.160
What if I don't get to see her again?
What if I don't get to say goodbye?

16:59.240 --> 17:03.920
That is not going to happen
because you're not going anywhere.

17:04.960 --> 17:06.240
But I failed chanting.

17:06.599 --> 17:09.280
And got away with it in art,
so you're 50-50.

17:12.440 --> 17:14.119
- Bye!
- See you.

17:14.200 --> 17:16.160
- Come on.
- What about Mildred?

17:16.760 --> 17:17.760
Don't worry.

17:17.800 --> 17:19.920
Mildred works in mysterious ways.

17:20.640 --> 17:21.520
I'm not a bat.

17:21.599 --> 17:25.079
I'm Mildred Hubble and I need
to transform back to stop Ethel.

17:25.720 --> 17:28.000
But I'm already too bat-brained
to remember how.

17:32.280 --> 17:33.920
What were you doing in there?

17:34.480 --> 17:35.480
Nothing.

17:35.800 --> 17:39.360
We did the candle, the cat's eye,
the fish in a dish...

17:39.440 --> 17:41.240
And the tangled mess?

17:42.680 --> 17:44.200
We've been having a laugh.

17:44.280 --> 17:45.280
Me, too.

17:46.840 --> 17:48.040
Or I will be.

17:50.040 --> 17:53.000
Oh, I do hope Mildred gets better soon.

17:56.560 --> 17:57.560
Right.

17:57.640 --> 18:01.600
Today, I am going to test your grasp

18:01.680 --> 18:04.640
on the physics of flying.

18:05.200 --> 18:06.840
- Hoo! Where do I begin?
- Felice.

18:09.720 --> 18:10.720
Um...

18:11.920 --> 18:13.480
Felicity Foxglove!

18:13.560 --> 18:18.080
Can you tell me
why witches ride broomsticks?

18:21.480 --> 18:23.120
Because it's easier than walking.

18:24.960 --> 18:28.800
Because it's easier than walking!
Oh, I couldn't resist that. It's...

18:29.440 --> 18:30.760
No, you don't, Ethel!

18:32.920 --> 18:34.520
Stray bat!

18:34.800 --> 18:36.360
Shouldn't it be asleep?

18:38.040 --> 18:40.600
It's probably got rabies or something.

18:43.880 --> 18:44.880
You've got it? Oh...

18:50.720 --> 18:53.600
Well, that got me noticed,
but not in a good way.

18:56.600 --> 18:58.520
- Eek!
- Now, look what you've done.

18:58.600 --> 19:00.360
Whoops! Sorry!

19:01.760 --> 19:04.360
Although that does give me another idea.

19:06.960 --> 19:09.440
So, that's a minimum witch-power of six
for take-off.

19:09.520 --> 19:11.760
Excellent, Miss Spellbody.

19:12.280 --> 19:16.440
Now, last but not least,
Enid Nightshade.

19:17.880 --> 19:22.920
Can you give me three reasons why
the broomstick is the best way to travel?

19:30.200 --> 19:31.760
It can be controlled.

19:35.960 --> 19:37.680
It has no fuel consumption.

19:37.760 --> 19:40.080
Good. Very good. And?

19:43.560 --> 19:46.160
- And it can furnish a familiar!
- Correct!

19:48.000 --> 19:50.080
Keep up the good work, everybody.

19:51.960 --> 19:54.840
- You're on track. What's up next?
- Potions.

19:55.160 --> 19:56.760
You'll be fine. Just...

20:01.040 --> 20:02.840
"Help. Not hat."

20:03.480 --> 20:04.480
What does that mean?

20:05.600 --> 20:08.320
I think it says "bat".

20:10.400 --> 20:11.840
Speaking of which...

20:21.040 --> 20:24.600
No Enid Nightshade, I see.

20:26.840 --> 20:30.520
No, Miss Hardbroom.
And Mildred and Maud are missing, too.

20:31.760 --> 20:34.240
I do hope they won't all get expelled.

20:39.520 --> 20:41.800
Let's play a quick round
of the Yes or No game.

20:41.880 --> 20:44.240
That's one squeak for "yes," two for "no."

20:44.720 --> 20:47.240
You say you're not a bat.
Are you a witch?

20:48.600 --> 20:52.040
- Wait. You don't think...?
- Are you Mildred?

20:53.080 --> 20:56.160
So, did somebody do this to you?

20:59.800 --> 21:01.120
What's the matter?

21:01.200 --> 21:03.240
Bats are notoriously short on brain cells.

21:04.000 --> 21:06.080
She won't be able to remember
the reversal spell.

21:06.160 --> 21:08.880
- Then we'll teach it to her.
- If it's not already too late.

21:08.960 --> 21:10.120
Come on, then, quick!

21:10.200 --> 21:11.960
You've got to get to Potions.

21:12.040 --> 21:14.920
I'm not going anywhere
until I know Millie's okay.

21:17.240 --> 21:21.600
A disguise potion is important for when
a witch wishes to travel incognito,

21:22.240 --> 21:25.520
to be camouflaged amongst hoi polloi.

21:26.080 --> 21:28.080
A little gaudy, Felicity.

21:29.440 --> 21:31.440
Nicely done, Ethel.

21:32.160 --> 21:33.840
Very twirly.

21:41.880 --> 21:44.720
- Fingers and toes...
- Hair black as pitch.

21:45.600 --> 21:46.680
Let's try this again.

21:47.800 --> 21:49.840
- Fingers and toes...
- Hair black as pitch.

21:51.800 --> 21:54.640
- You're going too fast.
- It won't work if it's any slower.

21:54.720 --> 21:57.240
Having a little party, are we?

21:57.320 --> 21:59.240
I'm sorry, Miss Hardbroom.
We just need a minute.

21:59.600 --> 22:02.920
- Fingers and toes, hair black as pitch.
- No wonder Miss Cackle reprimanded you

22:03.000 --> 22:05.800
- with insolence like this.
- No longer a bat. Make me a witch!

22:07.160 --> 22:08.960
- Millie!
- I didn't think I'd get to say bye.

22:09.040 --> 22:10.840
- I'm so sorry!
- Silence!

22:11.880 --> 22:16.200
Save your apologies for Miss Cackle.

22:19.680 --> 22:23.960
Wait right here.

22:30.160 --> 22:32.160
What happened, Millie?
Why were you a bat?

22:32.240 --> 22:34.160
Ethel and Felicity trapped me in my room

22:34.240 --> 22:36.320
when I heard them planning
to sabotage Enid.

22:36.400 --> 22:37.680
What? How?

22:38.120 --> 22:41.760
Something about perfect potions
for a pitiful performance.

22:42.520 --> 22:45.120
The paint, the chanting...

22:45.200 --> 22:47.481
And they were about to do something
in Spell Science, too.

22:47.560 --> 22:51.400
Until bat-you stopped them.
It was those two all along.

22:51.480 --> 22:52.840
We should tell Miss Cackle.

22:52.920 --> 22:53.840
What's the point?

22:53.920 --> 22:56.640
- I failed Potions, so I'm going home.
- Yeah, but...

22:56.720 --> 22:58.160
I let Felicity down

22:58.240 --> 23:00.800
and Ethel's angry
because she didn't get to see her mum.

23:01.440 --> 23:03.040
I know how that feels.

23:04.160 --> 23:05.600
I shouldn't have done what I did.

23:09.040 --> 23:13.280
Miss Cackle would like to see
Enid on her own.

23:16.320 --> 23:17.360
Thanks for everything.

23:24.160 --> 23:25.160
Both of you.

23:29.440 --> 23:31.800
It's time, Miss Nightshade.

23:37.520 --> 23:40.800
Whatever happens,
you'll always be my very best friends.

23:48.480 --> 23:50.760
You two, follow me.

23:55.680 --> 24:00.840
One thing I cannot abide
is an eavesdropper.

24:00.920 --> 24:03.240
- There's something I want to show you.
- What is it?

24:04.320 --> 24:06.600
You'll see.
It's just right through this door.

24:07.000 --> 24:08.320
- Watch it!
- Get out of the way!

24:08.680 --> 24:09.840
Wait! No!

24:23.160 --> 24:27.600
What is the meaning of this?

24:27.680 --> 24:30.240
Revenge is best served covered in slime.

24:36.840 --> 24:37.840
Right, Enid.

24:38.360 --> 24:42.600
I've spoken to your teachers,
and the feedback was mixed.

24:42.680 --> 24:44.920
I'm so sorry I let you down, Miss Cackle.

24:45.640 --> 24:46.640
Can you tell me why?

24:47.720 --> 24:49.000
There was something I had to do.

24:50.320 --> 24:53.600
You mean helping a certain Mildred Hubble
out of a spot of bother?

24:54.360 --> 24:55.360
Please, Miss Cackle.

24:55.440 --> 24:57.640
She shouldn't get
any of the blame to this.

24:57.720 --> 24:59.760
She became a bat because of me.

25:00.600 --> 25:03.480
I just... I had to make sure
she was all right.

25:04.200 --> 25:07.720
So, you sacrificed your place here
to help her?

25:12.800 --> 25:13.800
I'm impressed.

25:14.760 --> 25:17.160
You've shown you can be selfless,
make an effort...

25:17.800 --> 25:19.640
- be responsible.
- I have?

25:20.280 --> 25:21.280
Indeed you have.

25:22.920 --> 25:26.840
I told you earlier that every choice
you make has a consequence.

25:27.640 --> 25:30.040
And loyalty and kindness
do not go unnoticed,

25:32.440 --> 25:33.640
not at Cackle's Academy.

25:37.000 --> 25:40.680
<i>"I must try very hard not to be so silly.</i>

25:41.240 --> 25:43.120
<i>I must try very hard... ".</i>

25:45.120 --> 25:46.360
What was all that about?

25:46.920 --> 25:48.680
You were supposed to be my targets.

25:49.200 --> 25:51.720
I was trying to show you
that I do have a sense of humour.

25:52.160 --> 25:54.360
I'm not sure my sister and Felicity
would agree.

25:55.240 --> 25:58.160
Although, they did look pretty funny.

25:59.800 --> 26:01.520
I really messed up, didn't I?

26:02.720 --> 26:04.280
You don't have to be good
at everything.

26:05.280 --> 26:06.480
- Don't I?
- Nope.

26:07.040 --> 26:08.880
We think you're brilliant
just the way you are.

26:09.000 --> 26:10.800
Come on, give us some paper.
We'll help.

26:22.040 --> 26:23.720
Miss Cackle said you wanted
to speak to me.

26:24.040 --> 26:27.680
<i>I was so disappointed
with your behaviour this morning.</i>

26:29.000 --> 26:31.320
<i>But I'm glad you managed
to turn things around.</i>

26:31.880 --> 26:33.960
<i>I'm sorry about Careers Night.</i>

26:35.080 --> 26:37.520
<i>The truth is it's hard
being a working witch.</i>

26:38.400 --> 26:43.840
<i>I miss out on so much,
including watching my daughter growing up</i>

26:44.200 --> 26:47.560
<i>and turning into the great witch
that I know she will be.</i>

26:50.440 --> 26:51.440
<i>I'd better go.</i>

26:52.160 --> 26:53.320
<i>I'm proud of you, Enid.</i>

26:54.000 --> 26:56.280
Thanks, Mum. Break a broom!

27:04.000 --> 27:06.520
- Miss Cackle told us the news!
- It's so fantastic!

27:06.600 --> 27:07.480
Isn't it?

27:07.560 --> 27:09.640
And look what Mum sent!
My shortbread!

27:12.520 --> 27:14.240
- Did you speak to your mum?
- She's fine.

27:14.320 --> 27:16.960
Glad to have more time to practice
her speech for next time.

27:17.400 --> 27:18.960
I'm so happy I'm staying!

27:19.480 --> 27:20.400
I've learnt my lesson.

27:20.480 --> 27:22.360
I'll be steering clear of trouble
from now on.

27:22.440 --> 27:23.720
I don't know about that.

27:23.800 --> 27:26.040
Yeah. I thought Trouble
was your middle name.

27:26.120 --> 27:29.440
- Actually, it's Elvira.
- Elvira? Seriously?
