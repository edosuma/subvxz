00:17.500 --> 00:18.800
Nobody move ! 

00:23.900 --> 00:25.700
Let's go...

00:25.700 --> 00:27.000
Hey ! I can't get down ! 

00:32.800 --> 00:33.700
Get back in ! 

00:34.600 --> 00:36.200
Yo get back in.

00:46.500 --> 00:47.300
Damn it.

00:50.000 --> 00:51.500
Come on out of there, punk ! 

00:54.200 --> 00:55.100
I'm warning you ! 

01:01.300 --> 01:03.500
Aah ! Aah ! Ohh ! 

01:03.500 --> 01:05.200
Ah ! Ah ! Ohh ! 

01:20.800 --> 01:22.500
This is houston's fifth ward.

01:22.500 --> 01:26.200
It accounts for a large percent
of the city's growing homicide rate,

01:25.600 --> 01:29.100
Due to gang violence
And a bustling narcotics trade.

01:29.300 --> 01:31.300
Although in the last 48 hours,

01:31.300 --> 01:34.500
There have been
3 distinctive murders in the ward.

01:34.700 --> 01:35.600
Distinctive ? 

01:35.600 --> 01:38.600
3 men, 3 different
socioeconomic groups,

01:38.600 --> 01:41.000
All killed on the street
with their necks snapped.

01:41.500 --> 01:43.200
There appears to be
no other injury,

01:43.200 --> 01:46.200
And there's no apparent
connection between the victims

01:46.400 --> 01:47.300
Or motive.

01:58.200 --> 02:01.200
The ward's detectives
are inundated with homicides.

02:01.200 --> 02:03.500
Gang violence is a big problem.

02:04.100 --> 02:05.400
Shootings,

02:05.400 --> 02:07.000
Armed robberies,
it's an everyday occurrence,

02:07.000 --> 02:08.800
But this type
of street attack

02:08.800 --> 02:09.800
Is new to them.

02:10.100 --> 02:11.600
Could it be gang related,

02:11.600 --> 02:13.700
Maybe some new type
of initiation rite ? 

02:14.100 --> 02:16.200
The gangs in the ward use guns.

02:16.500 --> 02:19.400
In fact, no known gangs
exhibit this type of m.O.

02:19.400 --> 02:20.300
What about dope ? 

02:20.700 --> 02:22.200
These guys come up with
pretty freaky ways

02:22.200 --> 02:24.100
Of killing the competition
to get their message out.

02:24.400 --> 02:27.100
Yeah, but there just
doesn't seem to be any connection

02:27.100 --> 02:29.100
Between the victims
and the drug world.

02:29.300 --> 02:30.300
Homeless man,

02:30.300 --> 02:31.700
A construction worker...

02:33.100 --> 02:34.400
Security guard.

02:34.600 --> 02:37.000
Just 3 dead men and no witnesses.

02:37.000 --> 02:39.100
We're looking for
a homicidal serial criminal

02:39.100 --> 02:40.400
In a neighborhood
populated by criminals.

02:40.400 --> 02:42.400
The challenge will be
separating him from the rest.

02:42.600 --> 02:45.800
We have no evidence, no apparent
interaction between the unsub

02:45.800 --> 02:47.400
And the victims
pre- Or postmortem,

02:47.400 --> 02:49.500
And an indistinguishable M.O.

02:49.700 --> 02:50.800
Should be simple.

03:07.400 --> 03:10.000
"Criminal minds" 217

03:39.400 --> 03:41.600
"our life is made
by the death of others."

03:42.400 --> 03:43.600
Leonardo Da Vinci.

03:44.500 --> 03:45.800
We got a construction worker...

03:46.700 --> 03:47.900
Outsider in the community.

03:48.800 --> 03:50.000
We got a security guard...

03:50.200 --> 03:51.200
That's an authority figure.

03:51.200 --> 03:52.200
And then we got a homeless man.

03:53.100 --> 03:54.700
That's a powerless victim
that no one would notice missing.

03:54.700 --> 03:55.800
So who's he targeting ? 

03:56.500 --> 03:59.600
Let's see if any of the victims
frequented the same stores or sites.

04:00.000 --> 04:01.500
He used blitz attacks,

04:01.500 --> 04:04.000
Which means he most likely lacks
the interpersonal skills.

04:04.200 --> 04:06.300
He needed to coerce his
victims into coming close.

04:06.300 --> 04:08.100
And he also used
the element of surprise,

04:08.100 --> 04:10.700
Which means he may have stalked
his victims prior to killing them.

04:11.000 --> 04:12.900
Well, if that's the case,
i want to go to the last crime scene

04:12.900 --> 04:14.300
To see where
he may have been hiding.

04:14.300 --> 04:15.800
I want to see
the neighborhood for myself.

04:15.800 --> 04:16.800
Good.
I'll go with you.

04:16.800 --> 04:18.600
The rest of us will go to
the precinct and set up shop.

04:19.100 --> 04:21.399
I'll map out the area
and see if i can find any places

04:21.399 --> 04:23.100
The victims would have
visited in the neighborhood.

04:23.100 --> 04:25.800
Good. Maybe we can find
a connection between them.
I'll help you with that.

04:25.800 --> 04:26.700
I can handle it.

04:28.100 --> 04:29.500
I wasn't suggesting
that you couldn't.

04:29.500 --> 04:30.600
You know what "i'll help you
with it" means ? 

04:30.600 --> 04:34.600
Reid. Prentiss will help you
with the geographical profiling

04:34.700 --> 04:35.700
And victimology.

04:36.200 --> 04:37.000
Fine.

04:44.300 --> 04:45.900
Remember, this is a high-Crime area.

04:46.100 --> 04:48.100
Be vigilant.
Nobody goes anywhere alone.

05:27.500 --> 05:28.600
FBI, right ? 

05:29.500 --> 05:30.400
Agents Morgan,

05:30.400 --> 05:31.200
Gideon.

05:31.200 --> 05:32.100
Hi, how are you ? 
Nice to meet you.

05:32.100 --> 05:33.400
We really do
appreciate your help.

05:33.400 --> 05:34.500
Oh, we're glad to assist.

05:34.800 --> 05:36.000
The vic, the security guard,

05:36.000 --> 05:38.300
Was patrolling construction sites
in the neighborhood.

05:38.700 --> 05:40.200
Some equipment was vandalized.

05:40.200 --> 05:41.300
You think
the murder's related ? 

05:41.600 --> 05:43.200
The damage was kind of
unspecific,

05:43.200 --> 05:45.000
More like something
kids would do.

05:45.400 --> 05:47.800
The guard had a pistol,
which is now missing.

05:48.100 --> 05:49.900
This whole area,
it's empty ? 

05:49.900 --> 05:52.300
Except for a liquor store
around that corner

05:52.300 --> 05:53.900
And the locksmith on this end.

05:54.400 --> 05:55.700
And what about this
building right here ? 

05:56.000 --> 05:57.300
Oh, empty for years.

06:01.200 --> 06:02.100
Where's he going ? 

06:03.700 --> 06:05.100
Find out when he comes back.

06:09.100 --> 06:10.200
Detective Fuller ! 

06:11.900 --> 06:13.600
Let me see
what this here's about.

06:18.700 --> 06:20.600
Her son was at
the community center last night.

06:21.000 --> 06:22.800
I've lived in this
neighborhood all my life.

06:23.000 --> 06:24.100
So has my son.

06:24.500 --> 06:26.400
I didn't raise him to be a vandal.

06:26.600 --> 06:28.000
Yes, ma'am,
i'm sure you didn't.

06:29.000 --> 06:29.900
Kelvin ! 

06:31.400 --> 06:32.900
Well, i was...

06:33.600 --> 06:35.000
We was up here last night.

06:35.000 --> 06:36.600
We messed up some of
the equipment over there.

06:36.800 --> 06:38.900
I found some spray paint
on his clothes,

06:38.900 --> 06:41.600
And i knew he was up to trouble
with his no-Good friends.

06:42.000 --> 06:45.100
He will not be vandalizing
his own neighborhood again.

06:46.100 --> 06:47.200
Will you, son ? 

06:47.400 --> 06:48.200
No, ma'am.

06:48.900 --> 06:50.800
I was gonna drive him
to the police station,

06:51.100 --> 06:52.500
But i saw you already here.

06:54.200 --> 06:55.600
How much damage was done ? 

06:56.000 --> 06:58.700
Actually, we're here because
there was a murder last night.

06:59.000 --> 06:59.900
Murder ? 

07:00.100 --> 07:00.900
What murder ? 

07:01.300 --> 07:02.500
Security guard.

07:02.500 --> 07:03.500
Oh, my god.

07:03.500 --> 07:05.200
No. No.
He chased us,

07:05.400 --> 07:07.300
But i lost him.
I swear, i ain't touch him.

07:07.300 --> 07:08.600
Don't say another word, Kelvin.

07:08.800 --> 07:12.400
Kelvin... I only have one question
for you and then you can go.

07:12.900 --> 07:15.100
Did the security guard
fire his weapon at you ? 

07:15.300 --> 07:18.200
No. He, like,
shot into the air to scare us.

07:18.200 --> 07:19.200
And that's why we ran.

07:19.800 --> 07:21.100
Thanks. You can go.

07:23.600 --> 07:24.600
We can go ? 

07:25.000 --> 07:25.800
Yes, ma'am.

07:30.000 --> 07:32.700
You just sent away the last person
to see our victim alive.

07:34.000 --> 07:36.100
A boy that frightened
of his mother and that slight

07:36.700 --> 07:38.500
Doesn't have the skill,
courage, or size

07:38.500 --> 07:39.900
To kill the way
this unsub does.

07:39.900 --> 07:40.700
Hey, guys.

07:53.100 --> 07:53.900
Over here.

07:54.900 --> 07:56.000
Someone was living here.

07:58.900 --> 08:00.000
There, you got
a dirty blanket,

08:00.000 --> 08:01.700
Hamburger wrappers,
and soda cans.

08:03.200 --> 08:05.200
Those kids weren't
the only ones here last night.

08:10.600 --> 08:11.700
What's that ? 

08:11.900 --> 08:14.100
One of the detectives' wives
made us cookies.

08:14.900 --> 08:16.800
Wow. Homemade cookies ? 

08:16.800 --> 08:20.100
Yeah, I guess that's what
they mean by southern hospitality.

08:20.100 --> 08:21.000
What are you saying ? 

08:21.000 --> 08:22.600
Southern hospitality ! 

08:22.600 --> 08:23.600
I need to concentrate...

08:25.000 --> 08:27.300
How can anybody hear
with all this work going on ? 

08:27.500 --> 08:29.100
Well, you're gonna
have to get used to it.

08:29.100 --> 08:30.700
Construction crews
are working around the clock.

08:31.000 --> 08:32.000
Saw it on the way in.

08:32.500 --> 08:34.400
City's trying to return
to its splendor,

08:34.400 --> 08:36.100
And that means that
houston's poorest

08:36.100 --> 08:37.500
Are being kicked out
of their homes.

08:39.700 --> 08:40.900
Unsub might be homeless.

08:41.799 --> 08:43.200
Appears to have been
living in a building

08:43.400 --> 08:45.600
Next to where the security
guard was attacked.

08:45.600 --> 08:48.400
These are the locations of the last
3 murders, all near abandoned buildings.

08:48.500 --> 08:50.800
I noticed the neighborhood.
Maybe he was recently displaced.

08:51.000 --> 08:52.300
Could be a motive.

08:52.500 --> 08:55.200
Construction worker,
security guard at a construction site.

08:55.400 --> 08:56.200
Payback ? 

08:56.200 --> 08:57.100
What about the homeless man ? 

08:57.100 --> 08:59.100
We get a lot of beefs down
there among the homeless.

08:59.100 --> 09:01.400
That one could have just been
a fight about space or food.

09:01.900 --> 09:05.200
Let's get a list of residents Who've been
kicked out of their homes by the gentrification.

09:06.100 --> 09:07.200
You and Reid
check the shelters ? 

09:07.200 --> 09:08.000
Yeah, we're on it.

09:08.600 --> 09:10.800
Unless...
you ok with that, Reid ? 

09:11.700 --> 09:12.500
I'm fine with that.

09:14.500 --> 09:17.200
We should check to see if there are
any mental hospitals in the area,

09:17.200 --> 09:19.100
Maybe someone who was recently
released into the streets.

09:19.100 --> 09:20.100
Mm-Hmm. Got it.

09:20.100 --> 09:22.400
Morgan, can you cover
the police records for the last week ? 

09:22.400 --> 09:24.300
If it's someone
who's been recently made homeless,

09:24.300 --> 09:27.200
He might have stolen food,
comfort items, blankets,

09:27.200 --> 09:29.500
Toiletries... We might be able
to track a pattern of theft.

09:29.500 --> 09:30.700
Thanks.
Done.

09:45.800 --> 09:48.000
Are you lonely
in the lone star state ? 

09:48.400 --> 09:49.500
Are you wearing chaps ? 

09:50.400 --> 09:52.000
Only in your dreams, Garcia.

09:52.200 --> 09:54.100
Oh, not necessarily.

09:54.400 --> 09:55.500
I have photoshop.

09:55.800 --> 09:57.000
Hey, hey, behave.

09:57.600 --> 09:59.900
Focus your little
twisted mind for me, ok ? 

10:00.400 --> 10:02.100
I need police records
from the fifth ward...

10:02.100 --> 10:03.800
Small thefts and burglaries.
Can you do that ? 

10:04.100 --> 10:05.900
Aren't you at that
very station right now.

10:05.900 --> 10:07.500
Yeah, but it's a small precinct

10:07.500 --> 10:09.300
And these guys are stretched. Trust me.

10:09.600 --> 10:10.400
Got it.

10:11.100 --> 10:11.900
Oh, Garcia.

10:12.300 --> 10:15.500
See if you can find before and after
pictures of demolitions in the area.

10:15.500 --> 10:18.200
Maybe we can nail down a building where
the unsub may have worked or lived in.

10:18.400 --> 10:19.500
How far back ? 

10:19.900 --> 10:20.800
A week.

10:23.000 --> 10:23.700
And Garcia...

10:24.200 --> 10:26.500
I better not ever find
any photoshop pictures of me...

10:26.500 --> 10:28.600
Oh, trust me, my vision.

10:29.200 --> 10:30.600
You will never find them.

11:11.800 --> 11:12.700
Get out ! 

11:43.700 --> 11:45.800
Victim's name is Travis Overby.

11:46.000 --> 11:47.200
That's his buddy over there.

11:47.200 --> 11:49.500
He was working
a jackhammer on a new trunkline.

11:50.200 --> 11:52.600
He said one second
travis was going down the sewer,

11:52.600 --> 11:54.900
The next second
he was down at the bottom dead.

11:55.300 --> 11:56.800
From one second to the next.

12:01.100 --> 12:02.200
Someone has to go down.

12:02.900 --> 12:04.200
Aw, see, this ain't cool.

12:11.300 --> 12:12.700
I'm putting in for hazard pay.

12:13.400 --> 12:14.300
Good luck with that.

12:40.200 --> 12:41.900
It's pretty clean for a sewer ! 

12:43.000 --> 12:44.700
The trash is pretty much
cleared away.

12:45.500 --> 12:46.900
Yeah, i got a dirty blanket...

12:48.900 --> 12:50.700
Something else rolled up
in the corner.

12:51.800 --> 12:54.000
It's obvious he made himself
a place to sleep, but...

12:55.000 --> 12:56.200
He cleared it all away.

12:59.500 --> 13:01.300
It looks a lot like
the last place he was in.

13:01.600 --> 13:02.400
Huh.

13:03.200 --> 13:04.600
A new temporary home.

13:12.500 --> 13:14.200
Guys, it looks like
the jackhammer

13:14.200 --> 13:15.800
Must have knocked
some of the ceiling loose.

13:16.700 --> 13:19.200
It fell down all around him.
I'd be pretty scared, too.

13:19.700 --> 13:20.800
It's about survival.

13:22.400 --> 13:23.800
Carved out a place of his own,

13:23.800 --> 13:25.000
Saw a threat, he attacked.

13:26.300 --> 13:27.900
That's got to be why
the victims were so random.

13:28.700 --> 13:30.100
He didn't have
a relationship with them.

13:30.500 --> 13:32.100
They just happened to be
intruding on his home.

13:33.500 --> 13:35.100
We'll need to see
the other crime scenes.

13:35.100 --> 13:36.400
Sure ! Let's go ! 

13:38.100 --> 13:38.900
You all right ? 

13:38.900 --> 13:40.300
Yeah. You owe me.

13:47.600 --> 13:49.200
You all are looking
for someone in charge ? 

13:49.200 --> 13:50.700
I'm angie, one of
the administrators.

13:50.700 --> 13:52.900
Hi. I'm Agent Prentiss.
This is Agent Reid.

13:52.900 --> 13:54.000
We're with the fbi.

13:54.600 --> 13:55.800
Really ? 
Really.

13:57.300 --> 13:58.600
It looks like
you have your hands full.

13:59.000 --> 14:01.400
With the demolitions in the projects
and the abandoned buildings,

14:01.400 --> 14:03.100
There's no place else
for people to sleep.

14:03.100 --> 14:05.300
Well, thank god there are people
like you who take the time...

14:05.300 --> 14:06.700
Do you have a list of everyone
who comes through here ? 

14:06.700 --> 14:08.000
Angie: uh, we have
a sign-In sheet,

14:08.000 --> 14:10.100
But we don't force
anyone to sign if they don't want to.

14:10.100 --> 14:12.200
Some who do don't even
use their real names.

14:12.500 --> 14:14.100
Elvis eats here a lot.

14:14.300 --> 14:15.900
We would appreciate
any lists you have.

14:16.300 --> 14:17.100
Why ? 

14:17.100 --> 14:18.400
Have you noticed anyone who acts

14:18.400 --> 14:20.600
Unusually aggressive
towards the other residents ? 

14:20.900 --> 14:21.800
What's this about ? 

14:21.800 --> 14:23.700
A series of murders in the area.

14:23.700 --> 14:25.700
The perpetrator
may be a homeless man.

14:25.700 --> 14:27.100
Maybe someone who stays here.

14:27.100 --> 14:29.100
He may even be in this room
as we speak.

14:29.100 --> 14:30.300
My god, Reid.

14:30.300 --> 14:32.700
Have you noticed anyone
who acts paranoid or displays

14:32.700 --> 14:35.100
Explosive, unprovoked
bursts of violence,

14:35.100 --> 14:36.300
More than just
pushing and shoving ? 

14:36.300 --> 14:38.600
I mean, someone who really
tries to harm others.

14:38.600 --> 14:41.700
There are territorial fights
over food and places to sleep.

14:42.000 --> 14:44.300
The nurse treats people
for minor injuries all the time,

14:44.300 --> 14:46.000
But no one's seriously hurt.

14:46.200 --> 14:49.800
If anyone does come to mind,
give us a call.

14:49.800 --> 14:50.600
Thank you.

14:54.000 --> 14:55.000
A murderer ? 

14:55.000 --> 14:57.100
I'm sorry. Uh--Um...

14:58.200 --> 14:59.700
This investigation is still...

15:00.200 --> 15:02.600
No one's actually
been hurt in a shelter.

15:03.000 --> 15:05.300
We're just... We're acting with
an abundance of caution.

15:05.900 --> 15:07.700
So, please, let the police know

15:07.700 --> 15:09.100
If anything unusual occurs.

15:10.300 --> 15:11.200
Thanks.

15:20.300 --> 15:23.000
There's a high presence
of mental disorders with the homeless.

15:23.100 --> 15:23.900
Yeah.

15:24.200 --> 15:25.600
What the hell
was that in there ? 

15:25.600 --> 15:26.300
What ? 

15:26.300 --> 15:28.700
"He may even be in this room as we speak" ? 

15:28.700 --> 15:30.300
We have nothing to support that.

15:30.300 --> 15:32.200
We're investigating
a serial homicide.

15:32.200 --> 15:33.800
Should i have pretended
there's no danger ? 

15:33.800 --> 15:36.400
We just left that woman
potentially afraid

15:36.400 --> 15:38.300
Of every man who walks
into this shelter.

15:38.300 --> 15:40.900
Again, until we find
this unsub, how is that a bad thing ? 

15:42.200 --> 15:43.500
What is the matter with you ? 

15:44.300 --> 15:45.900
What do you mean,
what's the matter with me ? 

15:45.900 --> 15:47.700
I have never seen you act like this.

15:48.300 --> 15:50.000
Oh, really ?  Oh, in the months
that you know me,

15:50.000 --> 15:51.200
You've never seen me
act this way ? 

15:51.200 --> 15:52.600
Hey, no offense,
Emily, but...

15:53.000 --> 15:54.700
You don't really know what
you're talking about, do you ? 

15:59.800 --> 16:01.100
Good. Thanks.

16:01.300 --> 16:02.300
Just got back from
the local homeless shelter.

16:02.300 --> 16:05.100
The administrator hasn't noticed anyone
new displaying aggressive behavior.

16:05.100 --> 16:06.200
He's not in
a homeless shelter.

16:06.200 --> 16:07.300
I just talked
to Gideon and Morgan.

16:07.300 --> 16:08.400
They think that he's killing

16:08.400 --> 16:10.200
To protect some makeshift
shelter of his own.

16:10.200 --> 16:11.400
So are we ready
for a profile yet ? 

16:11.700 --> 16:12.700
We're missing something.

16:13.300 --> 16:15.500
How did this homeless man
learn to kill so efficiently ? 

16:15.700 --> 16:16.500
You know what we need ? 

16:16.900 --> 16:17.800
We need to get lucky.

16:18.100 --> 16:19.400
We need him to make a mistake.

16:35.200 --> 16:36.000
Hey.

16:37.700 --> 16:39.000
Come on, man, get out of there ! 

16:41.400 --> 16:42.700
I see you right there ! 

16:44.100 --> 16:45.300
Iaqui tengo mi tienda ! 

16:45.300 --> 16:47.100
There's a shelter
a couple of blocks from here.

16:56.200 --> 16:57.300
Vayase...

17:00.800 --> 17:02.100
Papa ! 

17:20.000 --> 17:21.200
Please help my daddy ! 

17:21.500 --> 17:23.099
I need help !  I was attacked ! 

17:23.500 --> 17:24.800
Can i get some help here, please ? 

17:24.800 --> 17:28.400
Please... Call my house
to come get my daughter. Please.

17:29.800 --> 17:30.600
Maria...

17:34.900 --> 17:36.800
Is my papa gonna be ok ? 

17:37.400 --> 17:38.200
Yes.

17:41.700 --> 17:45.000
Maria, could you answer
a few questions for us ? 

17:45.300 --> 17:47.300
It would really help us
find the bad guy.

17:51.200 --> 17:53.900
Did he say anything
to your papa ? 

17:54.800 --> 17:55.700
No.

17:59.100 --> 18:01.800
What were you and your papa
doing before the bad guy came ? 

18:06.900 --> 18:08.700
Papa took out the garbage.

18:10.200 --> 18:11.900
And then he jumped out...

18:12.700 --> 18:14.200
And he hit my papa.

18:17.700 --> 18:19.000
I was screaming at him.

18:19.000 --> 18:20.900
Don't hurt my papa ! 

18:21.900 --> 18:23.700
I thought he was gonna
hit me, too.

18:25.100 --> 18:26.400
But then he stopped...

18:28.900 --> 18:30.400
And he looked at me funny.

18:32.700 --> 18:34.000
What do you mean by "funny" ? 

18:35.800 --> 18:37.200
He looked...

18:38.000 --> 18:39.100
Sad.

18:42.900 --> 18:44.400
He did say something.

18:45.300 --> 18:46.700
Not to my papa.

18:46.700 --> 18:47.900
To me.

18:49.000 --> 18:49.900
What was it ? 

18:51.600 --> 18:53.000
He said...

18:53.600 --> 18:54.700
Are you ok ? 

18:55.300 --> 18:56.300
Why are you crying ? 

18:56.300 --> 18:59.400
And then we ran.
Go away !  Go away ! 

19:10.500 --> 19:11.300
Maria...

19:13.600 --> 19:15.200
What you did was very brave.

19:17.900 --> 19:19.600
Can you help us
with one more thing ? 

19:19.600 --> 19:21.400
Can you tell us
what the man looked like ? 

19:23.500 --> 19:24.800
He was white.

19:25.900 --> 19:27.000
And tall.

19:27.800 --> 19:28.800
And dirty.

19:33.100 --> 19:35.300
And he had a ring like yours.

19:35.300 --> 19:36.300
Like that ? 

19:39.900 --> 19:41.300
I remember his ring.

19:42.800 --> 19:43.700
Thank you.

19:47.600 --> 19:48.800
Iabuela ! 

19:58.300 --> 19:59.200
Gracias.

20:04.700 --> 20:06.900
He asked if she was ok
and why was she crying.

20:06.900 --> 20:09.100
He wasn't aware of what
he was doing to her.

20:09.500 --> 20:10.700
Garcia's on line one.

20:11.500 --> 20:12.800
Go ahead, Penelope.

20:13.400 --> 20:14.900
All right, cowgirls and boys.

20:14.900 --> 20:15.700
Hey.

20:15.700 --> 20:17.500
I've got the comparison
satellite images

20:17.500 --> 20:19.500
Of the before-And-After
pictures, and i found something.

20:19.500 --> 20:20.300
Check it.

20:21.100 --> 20:21.900
Do you see it yet ? 

20:22.100 --> 20:22.900
Yeah.

20:23.100 --> 20:24.100
Yeah, an s.O.S.

20:24.600 --> 20:27.000
Yeah, it's made of debris
and other rocky bits of gobbledygook.

20:27.000 --> 20:28.900
This is the building
where the security guard got killed.

20:29.500 --> 20:30.700
He's asking for help.

20:31.100 --> 20:32.400
Wait, guys. Listen outside.

20:35.700 --> 20:38.300
Chaos. S.O.S.

20:38.800 --> 20:40.200
He's a war veteran.

20:41.500 --> 20:42.900
He thinks he's in a war zone.

20:44.700 --> 20:47.200
He left a distress signal
on the roof of one of the buildings.

20:47.700 --> 20:50.400
The quick strikes
are consistent with trained military

20:50.900 --> 20:52.000
He must have served in a place

20:52.000 --> 20:53.500
That looked or sounded like this ward.

20:53.900 --> 20:55.900
Well, we were right
about him being homeless, in a sense.

20:56.700 --> 20:59.500
Wherever he is, in his mental state,
he's certainly not at home.

20:59.500 --> 21:01.600
He may not even be aware
he's killing.

21:01.600 --> 21:02.700
Now, how's that ? 

21:02.800 --> 21:04.600
When soldiers suffered
from anxiety, depression,

21:04.600 --> 21:07.000
And flashbacks in world war i,
it was called shell shock.

21:07.000 --> 21:09.000
In world war ii,
battle fatigue.

21:09.000 --> 21:10.900
Now we refer to it as ptsd,

21:10.900 --> 21:12.900
Post-Traumatic
stress disorder, war related.

21:12.900 --> 21:15.900
A side effect of which
is slipping into dissociative states.

21:16.200 --> 21:18.200
The mind divorces itself
from reality

21:18.200 --> 21:19.900
So it can cope
with the trauma.

21:19.900 --> 21:21.300
He's reliving a memory.

21:21.300 --> 21:23.400
He's trapped in his head
in some war zone.

21:23.400 --> 21:25.500
Hiding and defending himself
from the enemy.

21:26.100 --> 21:29.200
Ok, so how do we find
a man who's trapped inside his head ? 

21:29.200 --> 21:30.300
He's got a wedding ring.

21:30.700 --> 21:31.800
Someone's missing him.

21:32.100 --> 21:34.400
Good. I'm with detective Fuller.

21:34.400 --> 21:36.500
Morgan has last crime scene to check.

21:36.800 --> 21:38.600
J.J., check
missing persons reports,

21:38.600 --> 21:40.300
See if anyone matches
the description.

21:40.300 --> 21:41.500
It would have been
filed recently,

21:41.500 --> 21:43.100
The last 2 or 3 days.
Ok.

21:43.100 --> 21:44.000
Thanks.

22:08.000 --> 22:08.900
Hey.

22:09.600 --> 22:10.900
You shouldn't be out here.

22:11.400 --> 22:12.600
It isn't safe.

22:17.800 --> 22:18.900
It isn't safe.

22:35.000 --> 22:38.600
Dana Woodridge and Max Weston...
Her husband and his best friend.

22:38.600 --> 22:41.100
Roy Woodridge
has been missing since tuesday.

22:42.500 --> 22:44.300
He was on his way home from work.

22:45.100 --> 22:46.800
He called before
he left the office

22:46.800 --> 22:50.400
And said we needed to talk
when he got home.

22:51.900 --> 22:53.400
He sounded upset.

22:55.400 --> 22:57.200
That was the last
I heard from him.

22:57.500 --> 22:59.300
What was he upset about ? 

23:00.400 --> 23:01.600
He didn't say.

23:02.200 --> 23:04.000
Dana called me that night

23:04.000 --> 23:05.500
When Roy didn't show up.

23:05.900 --> 23:06.700
So...

23:07.200 --> 23:09.800
The next morning we filed
a missing persons report.

23:10.400 --> 23:12.400
Mrs. Woodridge, where
does your husband work ? 

23:13.300 --> 23:16.000
He's a consultant
at a security firm downtown.

23:16.500 --> 23:18.800
Did your husband
ever serve in combat ? 

23:18.800 --> 23:19.700
Excuse me ? 

23:20.200 --> 23:21.500
Is he a war veteran ? 

23:23.700 --> 23:24.800
Yeah.
Uh...

23:24.800 --> 23:25.700
We both are.

23:25.700 --> 23:27.100
We were in
special ops.

23:27.100 --> 23:28.500
75th ranger regiment,

23:28.500 --> 23:30.400
Bravo company, 3rd battalion.

23:31.500 --> 23:32.700
But Roy...

23:33.200 --> 23:36.600
He retired shortly after
things went bad in Mogadishu.

23:36.700 --> 23:38.400
That was back in 1993.

23:38.700 --> 23:41.400
Let me ask you this... Does he display
any sort of, uh...

23:41.700 --> 23:44.000
Behavioral tics...
Certain everyday things,

23:44.000 --> 23:46.000
They make him jumpy or startled ? 

23:46.600 --> 23:47.400
Why ? 

23:48.500 --> 23:49.500
Does he ? 

23:49.800 --> 23:51.800
Is this going to help find him ? 

23:52.100 --> 23:53.800
Mrs. Woodridge, please.

23:53.800 --> 23:56.200
We need to know everything
we can about your husband.

23:57.000 --> 24:00.000
We all had a...
hard time over there,

24:00.000 --> 24:02.900
You know... you bring
some things home with you.

24:03.500 --> 24:04.500
Like what ? 

24:07.000 --> 24:09.500
He has a hard time
with loud noises.

24:11.600 --> 24:13.200
He can't be in crowds.

24:15.100 --> 24:16.400
He has nightmares

24:16.400 --> 24:18.900
And wakes up in cold sweats.

24:21.700 --> 24:23.400
The smells are the worst.

24:23.800 --> 24:24.600
He...

24:25.400 --> 24:27.400
If he smells
something burning,

24:27.400 --> 24:30.800
Like a barbecue or gas or fire...

24:32.100 --> 24:33.300
He gets sick.

24:35.600 --> 24:38.400
It really only got bad
about a year ago.

24:39.900 --> 24:41.600
What happened to him in Somalia ? 

24:42.500 --> 24:43.400
Nothing.

24:45.900 --> 24:47.200
Combat happened.

24:49.500 --> 24:50.600
What does that mean ? 

24:56.800 --> 24:59.400
I'm gonna get a drink of water.

25:11.100 --> 25:14.300
You knew your friend
was suffering from symptoms of ptsd ? 

25:16.100 --> 25:17.700
He was a changed man, wasn't he ? 

25:18.700 --> 25:20.000
He was anxious,

25:20.700 --> 25:22.100
Paranoid, distant.

25:23.600 --> 25:25.000
He was far away in his head.

25:25.000 --> 25:27.600
I tried to get him
into a vet center to talk to somebody,

25:27.600 --> 25:29.000
But he said he was all right.

25:29.400 --> 25:30.800
What happened
in Somalia ? 

25:30.800 --> 25:32.000
What's he reliving ? 

25:36.500 --> 25:38.100
You can't tell Dana.

25:38.800 --> 25:40.500
Roy never wanted her to know.

25:44.000 --> 25:45.000
Thank you.

25:46.800 --> 25:49.100
Could somebody please
tell me what's going on ? 

25:49.500 --> 25:51.700
There have been some
people hurt recently,

25:51.700 --> 25:55.000
And we think that there
may be someone lost on the streets.

25:55.300 --> 25:57.400
Someone who thinks
that he's still at war.

25:58.100 --> 26:00.900
But Roy would never hurt
innocent people.

26:02.700 --> 26:04.900
Well, why would he even
be in this neighborhood ? 

26:07.100 --> 26:10.000
Hey, Garcia. We have
Mrs. Woodridge here with us.

26:10.400 --> 26:11.600
Oh, uh, well,

26:11.600 --> 26:14.300
I found an '02
white ford f150 pickup truck.

26:14.300 --> 26:16.300
Oh, my god. That's his truck.

26:16.300 --> 26:17.500
It was impounded.

26:17.500 --> 26:20.000
Uh, it had a flat tire
and was picked up on Lyon street

26:20.000 --> 26:22.100
About a quarter of a mile
from highway 59.

26:22.600 --> 26:25.100
He takes the east tex freeway
to work every day.

26:27.600 --> 26:29.400
Mrs. Woodridge,
I'm very sorry...

26:30.200 --> 26:32.200
But this is definitely
your husband.

26:33.200 --> 26:34.100
What  ? 

26:45.700 --> 26:46.800
Roy and I...

26:47.700 --> 26:51.100
We were escorting
a u.N. Aid caravan to a refugee camp.

26:52.000 --> 26:54.000
Our convoy was ambushed.

26:54.700 --> 26:56.200
The front received heavy fire,

26:56.200 --> 26:57.300
But we were in the rear,

26:57.300 --> 26:59.000
So we managed to escape.

27:00.500 --> 27:04.900
We hid for 2 days
in and out of abandoned buildings that...

27:04.900 --> 27:06.800
Insurgents were looking for us.

27:10.500 --> 27:13.300
One night I was sleeping,
Roy kept watch.

27:14.800 --> 27:17.700
When I woke up, there was
an ak-47 pointed right at me.

27:48.700 --> 27:49.800
A child.

27:51.000 --> 27:51.700
Yeah.

27:52.500 --> 27:54.500
They were all babies
back in Mogadishu,

27:54.500 --> 27:55.700
But this one...

27:56.000 --> 27:58.300
He couldn't have been
more than 11 or 12.

27:59.200 --> 28:00.400
Then what happened ? 

28:00.400 --> 28:02.500
We finally found a radio...

28:03.700 --> 28:05.900
Fixed it,
called for an extraction.

28:07.200 --> 28:09.100
Did you put out an S.O.S. ? 

28:10.000 --> 28:11.000
Yeah, we...

28:11.100 --> 28:14.100
We used rocks to put
an s.O.S. In the dirt

28:14.100 --> 28:15.900
So the blackhawks
could locate us.

28:15.900 --> 28:17.200
How did you know that ? 

28:18.300 --> 28:19.300
Look,

28:19.400 --> 28:21.900
If this is roy,
you're not gonna find him.

28:21.900 --> 28:23.500
He's trained and skilled
at survival.

28:23.500 --> 28:24.900
He knows how to hide.

28:25.300 --> 28:26.700
We think he has a gun.

28:29.000 --> 28:30.500
Well, he doesn't miss.

29:00.700 --> 29:02.200
We need to put
a s.W.A.T. Team together,

29:02.200 --> 29:04.000
Plan a grid search
and go building to building.

29:04.000 --> 29:05.600
He's reliving the war, isn't he ? 

29:05.600 --> 29:08.000
A specific incident
in which he killed a child.

29:08.300 --> 29:10.500
Guys, the s.W.A.T. Team's
gonna have guns, right ? 

29:10.800 --> 29:12.700
What happens if he tries
to fight them ? 

29:33.100 --> 29:35.200
Can I get you something,
Mrs. Woodridge ? 

29:35.200 --> 29:36.900
Those men are going
after Roy ? 

29:39.000 --> 29:40.400
Do they need so many guns ? 

29:40.400 --> 29:41.800
He's just one man.

29:41.800 --> 29:43.700
It... It's protocol, ma'am.

29:43.700 --> 29:45.200
How badly were they hurt ? 

29:47.100 --> 29:49.400
Y'all said
that people were hurt.

29:52.400 --> 29:54.000
Some people were murdered.

29:55.200 --> 29:56.200
Murdered ? 

30:01.400 --> 30:03.600
Mrs. Woodridge...
He never really came home.

30:06.400 --> 30:08.400
I lost him 14 years ago.

30:10.100 --> 30:12.100
It's been like
living with a ghost.

30:16.300 --> 30:17.300
Help him.

30:18.300 --> 30:19.600
Please, help him.

30:22.300 --> 30:24.000
We'll do everything we can.

30:24.800 --> 30:25.700
Ok ? 

30:31.600 --> 30:32.900
Reid, what are you working on ? 

30:33.400 --> 30:35.100
3 days ago police shut down
the freeway

30:35.100 --> 30:37.200
At 5 p.M. For 10 minutes.

30:38.100 --> 30:41.500
Cars were stalled and Roy must have
tried to exit on the surface streets.

30:42.000 --> 30:45.300
Sadly, he ended up in an unfamiliar
area with a flat tire.

30:45.600 --> 30:47.800
He was changing that tire
when an 8-Story building

30:47.800 --> 30:50.200
On market imploded
5 blocks away.

30:52.000 --> 30:53.900
He heard the explosion
and reacted

30:53.900 --> 30:55.900
Like a mortar bomb
had landed nearby.

30:56.500 --> 30:59.200
This explosion is what
triggered his dissociation.

30:59.200 --> 31:01.100
And since then,
he's been stuck in that state.

31:01.200 --> 31:03.400
Running when he needed to,
sleeping when he could,

31:03.400 --> 31:05.200
Camouflaging himself
into his surroundings,

31:05.200 --> 31:07.400
And hiding from
his perceived enemies.

31:11.300 --> 31:13.200
He's relieving
the worst moment of his life.

31:13.500 --> 31:14.900
He's gotta be
terrified.

31:15.000 --> 31:16.000
Yeah.

31:22.600 --> 31:23.600
Yeah, what do you have ? 

31:23.600 --> 31:25.000
Why isn't Derek
answering his phone ? 

31:25.100 --> 31:26.700
He's probably stuck
underground somewhere.

31:26.700 --> 31:27.600
Underground ? 

31:27.900 --> 31:29.200
I'll explain later.

31:29.200 --> 31:31.200
Oh. Ok. So,
I finally got through

31:31.200 --> 31:32.800
All those recent police reports
he asked me to check,

31:32.800 --> 31:34.800
Which, by the way,
it was no hopscotch through the park,

31:34.800 --> 31:36.000
Because that precinct you're at

31:36.000 --> 31:38.600
Is kind of tragically behind
on their paperwork.

31:38.600 --> 31:39.700
Yeah, they're undermanned.

31:39.700 --> 31:40.800
Oh, Jeez, really ? 

31:40.800 --> 31:42.300
I can't imagine
what that feels like.

31:42.400 --> 31:44.600
Oh, no, wait.
Yes, I can, 'cause...

31:44.600 --> 31:46.200
Garcia, do you have
anything for me ? 

31:46.600 --> 31:49.500
Well, he told me to look
for anything unusual,

31:49.500 --> 31:51.300
And it's all usual.

31:51.300 --> 31:53.800
Minor break-Ins,
apartment burglaries,

31:53.800 --> 31:56.500
Televisions, stereos,
car thefts, and smash and grabs.

31:56.500 --> 31:58.100
Common stuff in the world
of burgling.

31:58.100 --> 31:59.400
Nothing a guy
lost in the streets

31:59.400 --> 32:00.900
Might use for survival ? 

32:00.900 --> 32:02.400
No, nothing reported.

32:02.400 --> 32:04.200
It... like I said,
it's all petty.

32:04.200 --> 32:05.000
There's a...

32:05.100 --> 32:07.500
Some vandalism
at construction sites.

32:07.600 --> 32:09.300
Communications radio
missing from one of them.

32:09.300 --> 32:11.100
Wait... Did you say radio ? 

32:11.100 --> 32:13.500
Yeah. Construction Foreman
reported that one of their

32:13.500 --> 32:16.400
Trucks had been broken into
and a hand-Held radio was stolen.

32:16.700 --> 32:18.800
Yesterday.12 hours ago.

32:20.200 --> 32:21.400
Is that what you're looking for ? 

32:22.600 --> 32:23.400
Reid ? 

32:27.100 --> 32:28.200
This is Roy Woodridge,

32:28.200 --> 32:30.000
6'1", 195 pounds,

32:30.000 --> 32:31.000
44 years old.

32:31.700 --> 32:33.700
Brown hair,
former army ranger.

32:34.800 --> 32:37.000
It's imperative
you don't try to apprehend him alone.

32:37.500 --> 32:39.100
He won't understand
what's happening.

32:39.600 --> 32:41.400
He may try
to defend himself.

32:41.900 --> 32:44.300
He's armed, and he's an excellent
marksman.

32:45.000 --> 32:46.300
He may have stolen a radio,

32:46.300 --> 32:47.700
A walkie-Talkie.

32:51.200 --> 32:52.000
We were right.

32:52.000 --> 32:54.400
He had a nest of sorts
right near every murder scene.

32:54.500 --> 32:56.600
There was a burglary
of a two-Way radio

32:56.600 --> 32:58.400
From a construction site
recently.

32:58.400 --> 32:59.400
That could be Roy.

32:59.400 --> 33:01.300
We only used uhf
back then.

33:01.300 --> 33:02.500
He's looking for help.

33:03.000 --> 33:06.100
And he'll keep trying to
contact operations command.

33:06.200 --> 33:08.700
Detective, can we get a dozen uhf
radios set up in this room,

33:08.700 --> 33:11.700
And each of them tuned
to each of the preset channel frequencies ? 

33:11.700 --> 33:12.600
Right away.

33:12.600 --> 33:13.700
Wait a minute.

33:13.700 --> 33:15.600
When he calls,
we need to be very careful

33:15.600 --> 33:17.000
With the communication,

33:17.000 --> 33:19.900
Because we set up
specific responses to contact op com

33:19.900 --> 33:22.000
So we could avoid
hostile interception

33:22.000 --> 33:24.400
And to establish
"no danger" signals.

33:24.400 --> 33:27.800
And we had specific names
to identify our squad to the operator.

33:27.800 --> 33:29.500
Do you remember
the language you set up ? 

33:29.500 --> 33:30.700
I couldn't forget it.

33:30.800 --> 33:32.000
Roy and I wrote it.

33:32.000 --> 33:35.200
The callout was, "this is John Doe
looking for mark rippen."

33:35.200 --> 33:37.200
Rippen was our hero
at the time...

33:37.200 --> 33:40.200
Number 11, quarterback
for the redskins in 1993.

33:40.200 --> 33:41.600
Now we know where he is
in his head.

33:42.700 --> 33:44.600
He calls in, we'll be
on the other end when he does.

33:44.600 --> 33:45.900
What if he doesn't call ? 

33:46.200 --> 33:48.100
What if he just
kills someone else ? 

33:48.100 --> 33:50.000
Well, we'll deal
with that if it happens.

33:50.000 --> 33:51.700
Kind of easy for you to say.

33:51.700 --> 33:53.900
This guy may be messed up,
but that doesn't change the fact

33:53.900 --> 33:56.000
That he has killed
4 innocent people.

33:56.000 --> 33:58.100
Now, why don't we
just do the grid search ? 

33:58.100 --> 33:59.200
If you set up
a grid search

33:59.200 --> 34:00.800
And he confronts
one of your men,

34:00.800 --> 34:02.100
You'll be planning a funeral.

34:03.300 --> 34:05.500
I can guarantee you we're
right about his profile.

34:05.500 --> 34:06.600
This man wants to get rescued.

34:06.600 --> 34:09.400
All i'm asking is that you just
give us a chance to bring him in.

34:12.699 --> 34:13.900
It's channel 11.

34:14.400 --> 34:15.400
Are you ready Garcia ? 

34:15.400 --> 34:17.900
I've got nat recon
satellites all over the ward.

34:19.699 --> 34:20.600
Stand by.

34:22.699 --> 34:24.900
This is John Doe
looking for mark rippen.

34:27.400 --> 34:28.500
Can you help us ? 

34:29.500 --> 34:31.199
You know how to do this
better than we do.

34:34.100 --> 34:36.199
Roger that.
This is number 11, all clear.

34:36.699 --> 34:39.199
Maxey, boy, am I happy
to hear from you.

34:39.300 --> 34:40.600
I'm taking heavy fire.

34:40.600 --> 34:42.400
Request immediate extraction.

34:42.699 --> 34:44.000
What are your coordinates ? 

34:44.000 --> 34:47.300
Unknown. I lost my land
navigational aids.

34:47.699 --> 34:50.699
I went high, but i don't
recognize anything.

34:50.800 --> 34:53.100
I don't have a fix
on my grid coordinates.

34:53.100 --> 34:55.199
Any other way for him
to signal his location ? 

34:56.000 --> 34:57.600
Did you put up any flags ? 

34:57.900 --> 35:00.100
Yeah, you bet
your ass I did.

35:00.100 --> 35:01.700
I'm holding cover here.

35:02.300 --> 35:03.700
Roger that.
Hold your position.

35:05.800 --> 35:09.400
He triangulated. We need to look
for 3 large, colored flags,

35:09.800 --> 35:11.000
Maybe on rooftops.

35:11.000 --> 35:13.400
They'll be identical
in size and shape.

35:13.400 --> 35:15.100
Did you get that, Garcia ? 
Yeah, I got it.

35:17.600 --> 35:19.700
Number 11,
do you still read me ? 

35:19.700 --> 35:22.100
Garcia.
I'm working as fast as I can.

35:22.100 --> 35:23.400
I can still read you
loud and clear.

35:23.400 --> 35:24.300
Stay put.

35:27.900 --> 35:29.500
I found one.
I found one.

35:29.500 --> 35:30.800
I got them.
I see...

35:30.800 --> 35:32.300
Housing projects
and a courtyard.

35:32.300 --> 35:33.900
We need street names,
Garcia.

35:36.800 --> 35:38.100
Farmer and Capron ! 
Farmer and Capron ! 

35:38.100 --> 35:39.100
I know where that is.

35:39.100 --> 35:40.500
There's some abandoned
buildings right there.

35:40.500 --> 35:43.300
I'll have construction sites
to halt work and secure the streets.

35:43.300 --> 35:46.100
He's gonna expect
men in fatigues and a chopper as cover.

35:46.100 --> 35:47.400
I can take care
of the choppers.

35:47.400 --> 35:49.800
We're in black suvs. Tell him
we're security executives.

35:49.800 --> 35:51.500
You're coming with us.
We need to do this fast.

35:51.500 --> 35:53.200
Tell him to stay there,
we're coming to him.

35:53.900 --> 35:55.400
Roy, we're coming to you, buddy.

36:14.200 --> 36:14.900
Let's go ! 

36:42.100 --> 36:43.100
Thank you, god.

36:57.500 --> 36:58.900
Sergeant Woodridge ? 

37:00.000 --> 37:00.800
Got him.

37:01.300 --> 37:02.300
Where's Max ? 

37:03.600 --> 37:04.400
Roy.

37:04.700 --> 37:06.700
It's all right.
It's time to come in.

37:17.800 --> 37:19.000
He's got a weapon ! 

37:24.900 --> 37:27.800
No ! No ! Stop ! 

37:27.800 --> 37:29.100
Stop

37:45.400 --> 37:46.400
Look, it's all right.

37:46.800 --> 37:47.800
It's all right.

37:54.000 --> 37:54.600
No ! 

37:55.600 --> 37:56.400
It's not safe ! 

37:56.400 --> 37:58.900
It's a boy, sergeant,
it's just a boy.

38:16.700 --> 38:17.500
Roy ! 

38:20.700 --> 38:21.900
It wasn't safe.

38:22.300 --> 38:23.300
I know.

38:25.600 --> 38:27.000
Is the boy all right ? 

38:30.800 --> 38:31.600
Yes.

38:32.900 --> 38:33.900
Yes, sergeant.

38:35.000 --> 38:36.200
The boy's all right.

38:36.800 --> 38:37.900
That's good.

39:32.600 --> 39:34.200
Folks. Uh...

39:35.100 --> 39:37.400
Thank you so much for coming here.

39:37.700 --> 39:39.800
No one ever makes this place
a priority.

39:40.300 --> 39:41.500
We're grateful to you.

39:41.500 --> 39:43.200
I wish it had ended
differently.

39:43.700 --> 39:44.800
Yeah. Me, too.

39:44.800 --> 39:46.400
Hey, has anyone seen Gideon ? 

39:46.400 --> 39:48.000
Agent Gideon
left some time ago.

39:48.000 --> 39:49.600
Said he meet you all
at the airport.

39:49.600 --> 39:51.100
Did he say
where he went to ? 

39:53.000 --> 39:54.500
I think I know where he is.

40:06.900 --> 40:07.500
Hey.

40:13.700 --> 40:14.700
It's quiet.

40:15.000 --> 40:17.900
Construction's taking
the rest of the day off to honor the victims.

40:21.600 --> 40:23.500
You know, the first
reported war was...

40:24.500 --> 40:26.200
2700 b.C.

40:28.000 --> 40:29.600
Probably earlier wars, but...

40:31.400 --> 40:33.300
Writing hadn't been
invented yet.

40:36.600 --> 40:39.300
Almost 5,000 years
of killing each other.

40:41.700 --> 40:44.900
One thing human beings
have been consistently good at.

40:51.000 --> 40:53.100
We did everything we could
for him, you know.

40:54.800 --> 40:55.700
Yeah.

40:58.300 --> 41:00.700
Sometimes knowing that
just isn't good enough.

41:04.200 --> 41:05.300
I know.

41:14.200 --> 41:15.400
"if there
must be trouble,

41:15.400 --> 41:17.100
"Let it be in my day,

41:17.100 --> 41:19.200
That my child
may have peace."

41:19.500 --> 41:20.500
Thomas Paine.
