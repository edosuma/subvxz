Yeah, of course.

10:01.810 --> 10:04.688
You know what? I will text you.
We will figure it out. No pressure.

10:04.688 --> 10:05.522
None at all.

10:06.982 --> 10:08.275
- I'll text you.
- Okay.

10:13.739 --> 10:15.073
Amy?

10:17.075 --> 10:18.577
I want to hear you say it, okay.

10:18.577 --> 10:20.996
I want you to say
that you don't like Jessie.

10:21.955 --> 10:24.124
- What are you talking about?
Of course, I like Jessie.

10:24.124 --> 10:26.210
- Then why won't you--
What are you wearing?

10:26.210 --> 10:27.628
Onion goggles.

10:27.628 --> 10:30.506
- Oh. Then why won't you ask her
to do your hair for the wedding?

10:30.506 --> 10:32.883
- Mm. I really did not want
to have to say this,

10:32.883 --> 10:35.344
but the reason I'm not asking Jessie
to do my hair for the wedding

10:35.344 --> 10:37.930
is because I'm not so sure
she'll be at the wedding.

10:38.972 --> 10:39.973
What?

10:39.973 --> 10:42.643
- Because I'm not so sure
you two will still be together.

10:43.602 --> 10:45.312
- We've been together
since high school, Amy.

10:45.312 --> 10:46.605
No, Ben.

10:46.605 --> 10:49.024
You were together in high school,
but then you broke up

10:49.024 --> 10:50.442
because you wanted to see
what else was out there.

10:50.442 --> 10:52.236
And then you were together in college.

10:52.236 --> 10:53.237
- Mm-hmm.
- But then she broke up

10:53.237 --> 10:55.113
because she wanted to see
what else was out there.

10:55.113 --> 10:58.158
Plus, who knows what's going
to happen between you and--

11:00.077 --> 11:01.453
Santa?

11:01.453 --> 11:03.038
No, Ben. Maggie.

11:03.038 --> 11:05.666
She lives upstairs from you.
I was gesturing upstairs.

11:05.666 --> 11:07.000
- Maggie and I are just friends.
- Mm.

11:07.000 --> 11:08.752
- Alright. That has nothing
to do with this.

11:08.752 --> 11:12.005
- All I am saying is,
what if my wedding lands

11:12.005 --> 11:14.466
during one of the breakup portions
of your relationship?

11:14.466 --> 11:16.635
Okay, what if the sky explodes

11:16.635 --> 11:19.012
and pieces of planet fall
all over your reception?

11:19.012 --> 11:20.514
- Well, that's what
the tents are for, Ben.

11:20.514 --> 11:21.473
Okay, got it.

11:21.473 --> 11:23.684
- Okay, I'm sorry that you are
so upset about this.

11:23.684 --> 11:26.436
If I wasn't wearing these onion goggles,
I would be sobbing right now.

11:26.436 --> 11:28.355
Fine. Do your own hair.

11:28.355 --> 11:29.898
- I would literally never do
my own hair.

11:29.898 --> 11:31.191
I'm going to hire someone. Obviously.

11:31.191 --> 11:32.985
That's what we're fighting about
in the first place.

11:37.948 --> 11:39.199
Oh. Hey.

11:39.199 --> 11:40.200
Hi.

11:40.200 --> 11:41.785
Sorry. I can come back.

11:41.785 --> 11:44.496
- No, no, no. Don't go.
Just finishing up here.

11:45.706 --> 11:47.749
- Guess I'll have
to get used to folding

11:47.749 --> 11:49.334
a fitted sheet
in front of somebody.

11:49.334 --> 11:50.794
It's a lot of pressure.

11:50.794 --> 11:52.713
Oh, there's a trick to it.

11:52.713 --> 11:54.923
You just ball it up,
and then you shove it

11:54.923 --> 11:57.092
in the back of the closet
and make sure no one sees it.

11:58.260 --> 12:00.053
- I hear that's a good thing
to do with problems.

12:00.053 --> 12:01.096
Yeah.

12:04.516 --> 12:05.475
Are you okay?

12:06.018 --> 12:07.019
Yes, I am.

12:07.019 --> 12:08.645
Really? Because you just put

12:08.645 --> 12:10.981
all your folded laundry
back into the dryer.

12:12.191 --> 12:13.317
Yes, I did.

12:14.067 --> 12:17.029
Let's just say I wish
I was an only child for one day.

12:17.613 --> 12:19.448
Preferably Christmas,
because, you know, the gifts.

12:19.448 --> 12:20.616
But today would be nice too.

12:23.243 --> 12:24.828
Well, honestly, it's not that much fun.

12:24.828 --> 12:26.580
I never got a bunk bed,

12:26.580 --> 12:28.540
and there was nobody there
to turn to and say,

12:28.540 --> 12:30.751
"Hey, Dad's wearing
a woman's blazer, right?"

12:35.672 --> 12:38.550
- So how do you...
fold a fitted sheet?

12:38.550 --> 12:41.553
- Uh, slowly, and with a crippling fear
of making a mistake.

12:42.012 --> 12:42.763
Oh.

12:43.555 --> 12:46.183
That's another good way
to tackle problems.

12:47.684 --> 12:49.311
- See you.
- See ya.

12:55.651 --> 12:56.902
Hey, your door was open.

12:56.902 --> 12:58.862
- Hi, Mags.
- Hi.

12:58.862 --> 13:00.989
- Look who's here.
We got back together.

13:00.989 --> 13:02.783
Wow, that's great.

13:02.783 --> 13:06.036
- Uh, yeah, those last couple days
without Louise were so rough.

13:06.995 --> 13:09.706
Now I know how you felt
after we broke up.

13:10.249 --> 13:11.625
Yes.

13:11.625 --> 13:14.336
Anyway, I'm so happy for you two.

13:14.336 --> 13:15.712
Aww, thanks.

13:15.712 --> 13:18.131
And I can tell by the look
on your face that you really mean it.

13:18.966 --> 13:20.634
Get in here, Mogg.

13:20.634 --> 13:22.344
- He's got fun nicknames
for everybody.

13:22.344 --> 13:23.136
Oh.

13:26.557 --> 13:30.102
- I'm sorry, Logg,
but it's just not going to work.

13:31.353 --> 13:32.437
It's you.

13:33.313 --> 13:34.314
Not me.

13:39.319 --> 13:40.946
<i>Je m'appelle</i> Mogg.

13:45.993 --> 13:48.245
- Okay. <i>Oui, oui, oui!</i>

13:52.833 --> 13:55.586
♪

13:55.586 --> 13:58.797
♪

13:59.923 --> 14:02.676
- Who keeps texting?
- Hmm? Oh, nobody.

14:03.218 --> 14:05.095
Hmm. Nobody sounds interesting.

14:05.554 --> 14:07.431
Why aren't you texting Nobody back?

14:07.431 --> 14:09.558
Oh, I really want to.

14:09.558 --> 14:11.268
But, you know, that's a losing game,

14:11.268 --> 14:14.688
because I text him back
and then he texts me back again,

14:14.688 --> 14:17.441
and then I text back again
and then, boom, carpal tunnel. So--

14:17.441 --> 14:20.402
- Well, it sounds like somebody
is textually frustrated.

14:22.487 --> 14:24.990
Hey. What's wrong?
That was hilarious.

14:26.658 --> 14:29.077
- I had a vision of Louise
getting dumped,

14:29.077 --> 14:31.163
and I obviously can't tell her.

14:31.163 --> 14:32.539
I don't know what to do.

14:32.539 --> 14:33.790
Well, that's nothing new.

14:33.790 --> 14:36.335
I mean, you have a no visions policy
with your friends.

14:36.335 --> 14:38.837
- Yeah, but maybe I was
giving her signals on purpose.

14:38.837 --> 14:41.590
Like, I wanted her to know
what was going to happen.

14:41.590 --> 14:42.549
Yeah.

14:42.549 --> 14:44.718
Like when mom tells me
to change my jacket

14:44.718 --> 14:47.054
because I'm accidentally
wearing her blazer.

14:47.763 --> 14:49.264
Mmm, no.

14:49.806 --> 14:53.101
I just feel horrible because I know
how sad Louise is going to be,

14:53.101 --> 14:54.645
and she doesn't even see it coming.

14:55.562 --> 14:57.481
- Well, welcome to parenthood,
sweetheart.

14:57.481 --> 14:59.691
- What does that mean?

14:59.691 --> 15:02.277
- Well, don't you think, as parents,
that we can see the mistakes

15:02.277 --> 15:03.904
you're going to make before you make them?

15:03.904 --> 15:07.407
Like when you thought it was a good idea
to paint on a beauty mark every day

15:07.407 --> 15:08.992
because you thought
nobody would notice.

15:08.992 --> 15:10.953
Why did you let that happen?

15:10.953 --> 15:12.496
How else would you have learned?

15:13.413 --> 15:15.499
No. We have to just let you make
your own mistakes.

15:16.542 --> 15:19.628
For instance, I might think
it's a mistake to get texts

15:19.628 --> 15:22.673
from somebody you clearly like
and not respond,

15:22.673 --> 15:24.591
but I'm not going to say anything.

15:26.260 --> 15:30.931
Okay. Are you smiling
because of my very sage advice

15:31.306 --> 15:33.934
or because you have a good hand?

15:43.610 --> 15:44.695
No.

15:44.695 --> 15:47.406
No. You got something.
I can tell. I fold.

15:48.866 --> 15:50.409
- I got nothing.
- Ah!

15:54.204 --> 15:56.874
- You know, I'm really
not looking forward to dinner tonight.

15:56.874 --> 15:58.959
Ben's just going to make me
feel guilty the whole time.

15:59.626 --> 16:01.545
- Don't you think
you should feel guilty?

16:01.545 --> 16:05.174
I mean, you basically told your brother
you don't believe in his relationship.

16:05.174 --> 16:06.884
Well, that's not really fair.

16:06.884 --> 16:09.261
Ben doesn't understand
the position he put me in.

16:09.261 --> 16:11.638
- Look, if someone in my family
didn't fully accept you,

16:11.638 --> 16:14.892
it would be like they killed my spirit
and dimmed my inner light.

16:15.350 --> 16:17.186
Oh no, not your inner light.

16:17.686 --> 16:19.688
- When you first introduced me
to Ben,

16:19.688 --> 16:22.858
I was like some rando you met
in a tent, right?

16:22.858 --> 16:23.483
Yeah.

16:23.483 --> 16:26.862
- But he accepted me right away.
No questions asked.

16:26.862 --> 16:28.780
That's what family does.

16:28.780 --> 16:30.699
- Thank you for always
keeping me grounded.

16:31.283 --> 16:32.284
That's what I'm here for.

16:40.542 --> 16:42.085
Um... Oh.

16:43.420 --> 16:45.130
- Hey, what's wrong?

16:46.381 --> 16:48.383
- I'm sorry. I thought I could do this,
but I just can't.

16:49.426 --> 16:50.511
What do you mean?

16:50.511 --> 16:52.721
- You broke up with me
out of nowhere,

16:52.721 --> 16:54.806
and it really triggered
my abandonment issues.

16:55.307 --> 16:57.851
Now, I'm constantly afraid
you're going to break up with me again.

16:58.977 --> 17:01.230
I'm like a rescue dog
that pees when you touch it.

17:01.230 --> 17:02.856
Aww, John.

17:04.525 --> 17:07.402
But, you know, that was
a total misunderstanding.

17:07.402 --> 17:10.531
Like, I didn't even really want
to break up with you.

17:10.531 --> 17:13.367
- That just makes it
even more confusing.

17:13.367 --> 17:15.118
And I'm hardly ever confused.

17:16.328 --> 17:18.330
Look, I can't eat, I can't sleep,

17:18.330 --> 17:20.165
I can't write my music at all.

17:20.165 --> 17:21.917
Even when I take my shirt off.

17:21.917 --> 17:24.711
Nothing. I mean, the muse is gone.

17:24.711 --> 17:26.713
And my shirt's gone, too,

17:26.713 --> 17:28.590
because I can't remember
where I put it.

17:29.132 --> 17:31.927
John, we're so good together.

17:31.927 --> 17:34.513
You know, I mean, I love it
when you pick me up

17:34.513 --> 17:35.764
and carry me around.

17:35.764 --> 17:37.558
Do you want to do that?
Maybe that would help.

17:39.101 --> 17:40.435
No. No, no, no.

17:40.435 --> 17:43.939
My, my dojo bros warned me to be
more cautious with my heart.

17:44.398 --> 17:46.859
They said we were stuck
in a pursue-withdraw cycle.

17:48.151 --> 17:50.028
You're breaking up with me?

17:50.529 --> 17:54.074
- I'm sorry, Logg,
but it's just not going to work.

17:55.951 --> 17:58.579
It's you. Not me.

18:01.456 --> 18:03.166
I'm blindsided.

18:04.168 --> 18:06.837
- Is that the one where you
can't see far or close up?

18:08.088 --> 18:09.173
Both.

18:19.349 --> 18:21.810
- Great work on the engagement
announcement, Ben.

18:21.810 --> 18:23.145
Thank you.

18:23.145 --> 18:25.606
- I really liked
all the champagne emojis.

18:25.606 --> 18:26.815
- Oh, that was all me, babe.
- Oh.

18:29.234 --> 18:32.613
So, Jessie, I hate that this is,
like, out of the blue,

18:32.613 --> 18:35.407
but I've been wanting
to ask you something.

18:35.407 --> 18:36.992
JESSIE:
Oh, Amy, it's okay.

18:36.992 --> 18:38.744
It's really fine if you want
to have someone else do your hair.

18:38.744 --> 18:41.330
- No, it's not that.
I actually wanted to know

18:41.330 --> 18:44.416
if you'd be
one of my bridesmaids.

18:44.833 --> 18:47.336
- What? Really?
- Uh-huh.

18:47.336 --> 18:50.047
You're like my family,
and I want you there by my side.

18:50.047 --> 18:52.549
- Oh my god, Amy,
I would love to!

18:52.549 --> 18:53.717
Thank you.

18:54.635 --> 18:57.387
- And also, yes, I would love it
if you would do my hair.

18:57.387 --> 19:00.182
Of course. And maybe
the other bridesmaids' hair, too.

19:00.182 --> 19:01.391
And my mom's.

19:01.391 --> 19:03.227
Oh, wow.

19:03.227 --> 19:04.603
I mean, while I'm there,

19:04.603 --> 19:06.104
I might as well just do
the groom's side, too, right?

19:06.104 --> 19:07.314
- Oh my gosh, would you?
- Hmm, that'd be great.

19:07.314 --> 19:09.024
That'd be so awesome.
I didn't want to ask, but--

19:09.024 --> 19:11.318
♪

19:16.823 --> 19:17.699
Hi.

19:18.283 --> 19:19.409
John broke up with me.

19:20.035 --> 19:22.663
- I know.
- You know?

19:22.663 --> 19:24.623
But you didn't make a weird face

19:24.623 --> 19:26.542
or swallow a fly or anything.

19:26.542 --> 19:28.627
- Oh my god,
how many times have I done that?

19:28.627 --> 19:30.504
- Just the once.
But it really stuck with me.

19:31.213 --> 19:32.631
Oh, Lou.

19:33.257 --> 19:35.384
I, I didn't make a face
because I've been working

19:35.384 --> 19:37.052
on hiding my tells.

19:37.052 --> 19:40.055
- What? No, no, no, no.
You can't do that. I need those.

19:40.055 --> 19:42.641
- You don't.
- Yes, I do.

19:42.641 --> 19:45.727
I can't go through life acting solely
on my own instincts.

19:45.727 --> 19:48.564
- They suck.
- Lou, it's okay to make mistakes.

19:49.022 --> 19:50.440
In fact, it's right to.

19:50.941 --> 19:52.693
Yeah, but I don't wanna.

19:52.693 --> 19:54.862
I mean, can't you just keep
feeding me fish

19:54.862 --> 19:56.780
instead of trying to teach me how to fish?

19:56.780 --> 19:58.240
That sounds really hard.

19:58.240 --> 19:59.825
You're doing better than I am.

19:59.825 --> 20:01.326
At least you go for it.

20:01.326 --> 20:03.996
I've got a real catch,
and I'm afraid to reel him in.

20:04.955 --> 20:07.374
- Well, if there's anything
that John taught me,

20:07.374 --> 20:10.752
it's that you don't want to be
in a pursue-withdrawal cycle.

20:10.752 --> 20:11.461
Hmm.
