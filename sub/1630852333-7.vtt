Oh, come on!

00:11.678 --> 00:13.013
[phone rings]

00:13.054 --> 00:14.222
- This is Kernst.

00:14.264 --> 00:16.016
- Major, it's MacGruber.

00:16.057 --> 00:17.559
You seeing this Ecuador shit?

00:17.600 --> 00:20.311
- You son of a bitch!
- What?

00:20.353 --> 00:22.313
- Oh, cut the crap.
You played me.

00:22.355 --> 00:23.857
- Sir, the only thing
I've been playing

00:23.898 --> 00:25.942
is with Vicki's beautiful
breasts and vagina

00:25.984 --> 00:28.737
for ten straight hours,
minus bathroom breaks.

00:28.778 --> 00:31.281
So you mind telling me what
the hell you're talking about?

00:31.322 --> 00:32.407
- You sold us down the river.

00:32.449 --> 00:33.658
This raid on Queeth's compound

00:33.700 --> 00:34.826
was supposed to be
the end of this thing.

00:34.868 --> 00:36.911
You said Brimstone
was contained.

00:36.953 --> 00:38.705
- Uh, yeah, I thought it was.

00:38.747 --> 00:40.707
But clearly someone
is still behind it!

00:40.749 --> 00:43.918
Someone terribly evil.
Someone who has to be stopped.

00:43.960 --> 00:46.796
- Oh, yeah.
I'm talking to him right now.

00:46.838 --> 00:50.050
- Oh, thank God.
Okay, Kernst, listen carefully.

00:50.091 --> 00:51.593
You have to keep him
on the line

00:51.634 --> 00:53.303
and trace that telephone call

00:53.345 --> 00:54.804
so we can find out
exactly where--

00:54.846 --> 00:57.349
- MacGruber!
I'm talking about you.

00:57.390 --> 00:59.309
- Oh, you're fucking insane!

00:59.351 --> 01:02.354
- Special agents in Ecuador
found DNA

01:02.395 --> 01:03.688
on a dispersal device,

01:03.730 --> 01:05.899
and it's a presumptive match
to you!

01:05.940 --> 01:08.443
- Come on, this is clearly
a frame job.

01:08.485 --> 01:10.695
Queeth's final fuck you
from the grave.

01:10.737 --> 01:13.156
You gotta believe me.
I'm one of the good guys.

01:13.198 --> 01:14.783
I got nothing to hide.

01:14.824 --> 01:17.035
- If that's true, then come
turn yourself in right now.

01:17.077 --> 01:19.412
- You know I can't do that.

01:19.454 --> 01:22.457
- Well, I guess we both know
how this is gonna end.

01:22.499 --> 01:24.501
- Yeah, with you putting
a medal around my neck.

01:24.542 --> 01:26.127
- Or a bullet in your head.

01:26.169 --> 01:27.754
- Tomato, "toe-ma-toe."

01:27.796 --> 01:30.965
- MacGruber, I'ma give you
one last chance.

01:31.007 --> 01:33.426
Every law enforcement officer
in the country

01:33.468 --> 01:34.719
will be looking for you,

01:34.761 --> 01:36.554
and the orders
will be shoot to kill.

01:36.596 --> 01:38.682
- Major, Queeth may be
dead now,

01:38.723 --> 01:41.226
but someone is keeping
his plan in motion,

01:41.267 --> 01:43.395
and you're seriously
asking me to stand down?

01:43.436 --> 01:45.522
- I'm not asking.

01:45.563 --> 01:49.818
- Well, in that case,
catch me if you can.

Oh, watch out

on that thing.

because I have some big news.

what are you guys doing here?

- Haven't you been
watching the news?

03:30.001 --> 03:32.587
The poisonous cloud
over Ecuador?

03:32.629 --> 03:34.589
Somehow Queeth's plan
is still on.

03:34.631 --> 03:36.841
- That's impossible.

03:36.883 --> 03:39.135
- Tens of thousands of people
have been reported dead,

03:39.177 --> 03:40.637
and we can only assume

03:40.679 --> 03:42.681
that number is going to rise
in the coming days.

03:42.722 --> 03:45.141
- Holy shit.
But I thought Queeth was dead!

03:45.183 --> 03:46.518
I thought this was over.

03:46.559 --> 03:48.520
- Checkers, the only thing
that's over

03:48.561 --> 03:50.897
is the amount that
this motherfucker is not over.

03:50.939 --> 03:53.274
I mean, we are
in grave danger here!

03:53.316 --> 03:55.568
Ooh, can I play with your baby?

03:55.610 --> 03:57.487

for this man--

03:57.529 --> 03:59.781
former military officer
MacGruber.

03:59.823 --> 04:02.033

there's Uncle MacGruber.

04:02.075 --> 04:03.785
- Jesus, you're wanted?

04:03.827 --> 04:06.287
- Oh, yeah, super wanted.
Like, shoot to kill.

04:06.329 --> 04:07.664
Hell, I mean, for all I know,

04:07.706 --> 04:09.249
they could have their scopes
on me right now.

Huh? Oh, that's so cute.
I'm jealous, and I'm an adult.

04:15.547 --> 04:16.923
Huh? Is that--

04:16.965 --> 04:19.801
Oh, what? No. Aww.

04:19.843 --> 04:22.679
Now, let's focus up.
We got a terrorist to catch.

04:22.721 --> 04:24.514
Now, I won't go as far
as to say that

04:24.556 --> 04:26.266
this is a
"Mission: Impossible,"

04:26.307 --> 04:29.310
but at the very least,
it's a "Mission: Very Hard."

No clues, no leads.

I stole from the NSA,

a little bit.

04:51.833 --> 04:54.085
So don't worry. We got this.

04:54.127 --> 04:55.628
- ID, please.

05:02.469 --> 05:04.137
So your name is Sharold?

05:04.179 --> 05:07.807
- Of course my name is Sharold.
Sharold Kernst.

05:09.434 --> 05:11.269
- Interesting name.

05:11.311 --> 05:12.771
- It's a family name.

05:12.812 --> 05:16.649
My grandmother was Sharold,
her mother and her aunts,

05:16.691 --> 05:21.821
and most of her sisters,
and some of her sons.

05:21.863 --> 05:25.325

Both the S and the H
are capitalized.

05:35.377 --> 05:37.462
- Yeah.

05:37.504 --> 05:40.757
Uh, That's because
it's S. Harold Kernst.

05:40.799 --> 05:43.176
- And the S stands for Sharold?

05:43.218 --> 05:44.719
- Stands for Sharold.

05:44.761 --> 05:48.765
- So your name
is Sharold Harold Kernst.

05:50.266 --> 05:51.726
- Yep.

05:56.773 --> 05:59.609

we should be leaving, so.

- Well, I don't know.
We got a little bit of time.

06:25.635 --> 06:28.596

need me in there?

this is something

06:49.617 --> 06:51.202
I need to do on my own.

The harder way?

I'll tell you everything!

- Thank you.

09:35.658 --> 09:38.411

09:38.453 --> 09:42.332
there was someone working
on the inside with Queeth.

09:42.374 --> 09:43.958
I never knew who it was.

09:44.000 --> 09:46.961
I only knew them
as the Architect.

09:48.421 --> 09:52.133
But they controlled everything.
Everything.

09:52.175 --> 09:55.970

this "The Architect."

09:56.012 --> 09:58.682
- I don't know much.
[sniffles]

09:58.723 --> 10:00.183
They covered their tracks
very well,

10:00.225 --> 10:03.228
so I was never able to piece
the whole thing together.

10:03.269 --> 10:07.816
But what I do know
is in my computer,

10:07.857 --> 10:09.859

10:11.027 --> 10:14.406
Sorry.
Wish I could tell you more.

11:16.885 --> 11:19.304
Thank you. Are you going up?

11:19.346 --> 11:24.225

[suspenseful music]

11:51.711 --> 11:53.963
* *

11:54.005 --> 11:56.299
- Shit. We'll never find it.

11:56.341 --> 11:59.219
- They're alphabetized.
- What?

11:59.260 --> 12:00.845
- Got it.
- [gasps]

12:00.887 --> 12:02.597
- Nice job, Piss.

12:06.017 --> 12:08.728
[dramatic music]

12:08.770 --> 12:15.610
* *

12:32.502 --> 12:35.130
- Who is this guy?

12:35.171 --> 12:36.881
- Hurry up, Vic.
This computer might be

12:36.923 --> 12:39.300
our only shot to find out
who the Architect is.

12:39.342 --> 12:41.678
- I know, I'm sorry,
it's just going so slow!

12:41.720 --> 12:43.221
Come on! Come on!

12:43.263 --> 12:44.931
- Checkers, how we doing
with the 5-0?

12:44.973 --> 12:46.850
- All doors are locked,
there's no movement

12:46.891 --> 12:48.893
in Stairwell 6, so that's
our best bet for escape.

12:48.935 --> 12:50.645
We make it to
the parking structure

12:50.687 --> 12:51.813
and drive out the front gate

12:51.855 --> 12:53.231
before anyone knows
we were here.

12:53.273 --> 12:54.441
That's probably not
what'll happen,

12:54.482 --> 12:55.859
but it's always good
to have a plan, I guess.

12:55.900 --> 12:57.444
- Loud and.

12:57.485 --> 12:59.738
[computer beeps]
- Shoot, shoot, shoot.

12:59.779 --> 13:02.407
Guys, we have a problem.
We need his password.

13:02.449 --> 13:04.367
- Oh, shit, shit, shit! Shit!

13:04.409 --> 13:05.869
Okay, relax, Vicki.

13:05.910 --> 13:08.830
Last thing we need
is a major freak-out right now.

13:08.872 --> 13:09.789
Okay, so don't panic.

13:09.831 --> 13:11.207
We'll get through
this together.

13:11.249 --> 13:12.667
So try this. You ready?
- Yeah.

13:12.709 --> 13:16.129
- Type in six, nine, six, nine,
six, nine, six, nine.

13:16.171 --> 13:17.422
- Okay.

13:17.464 --> 13:19.257
Six, nine, six, nine,
six, nine, six.

13:19.299 --> 13:20.592
- Nine.
One final nine in there.

13:20.633 --> 13:22.802
- Nine.
[computer beeps]

13:22.844 --> 13:24.054
- Fuck.

13:24.095 --> 13:26.222
Okay. Okay. Okay. No worries.

13:26.264 --> 13:28.558
Let's just change it up
a little bit and go with this.

13:28.600 --> 13:32.645
Six, nine, six, nine,
six, nine, six, nine,

13:32.687 --> 13:33.688

[computer beeps]

13:36.941 --> 13:40.445
Shit fuck! Okay. Okay.

13:40.487 --> 13:43.156
Six, nine, six, nine,
six, nine, six, nine,

13:43.198 --> 13:45.408
six, nine, six, nine.

13:45.450 --> 13:46.785
[computer beeps]

13:46.826 --> 13:48.912
Oh, God! Oh, God. Oh, God.
What do we do here?

13:48.953 --> 13:51.498
Okay, okay, how about
just six, nine, six, nine?

13:54.250 --> 13:55.543
Fuck!

14:27.575 --> 14:28.618
Okay, try that.

14:28.660 --> 14:31.454
No! Wait, wait, wait. Wait.

14:31.496 --> 14:33.331
Six, nine.

14:36.751 --> 14:38.128
Shit!

14:38.169 --> 14:41.297
Well, it's official:
we're never gonna get in.

14:41.339 --> 14:43.508
- Let me try something.

14:44.843 --> 14:45.844
[computer beeps]

14:45.885 --> 14:46.970
Oh, we're in!

14:47.012 --> 14:50.140
- Nice on, Vic!
How many 69s was that?

14:50.181 --> 14:51.349
- Uh, none.

14:51.391 --> 14:52.976
He used
our wedding anniversary.

14:53.018 --> 14:55.979
- Oh, your wedding anniversary.
- Yeah.

14:56.021 --> 14:59.065
- Oh, what a fucking goober.
[laughs]

14:59.107 --> 15:00.400
That's so dumb.

15:00.442 --> 15:02.193
Jesus.

15:02.235 --> 15:04.654
Ugh, just makes me barf
in my mouth a little bit.

15:04.696 --> 15:06.114
I mean, anybody
could look that up.

15:06.156 --> 15:07.323
It's public record.

15:07.365 --> 15:09.325
That's the stupidest thing
I've ever seen.

15:09.367 --> 15:10.952
So fucking dumb.

15:10.994 --> 15:13.663
Okay, now do a search
for "architect" or "Queeth"

15:13.705 --> 15:15.540
or maybe the word "plan"

15:15.582 --> 15:17.334
or the phrase
"miscellaneous evil."

15:17.375 --> 15:18.668
- On it.

15:18.710 --> 15:20.253
- We're running out of time!

15:20.295 --> 15:21.713
- Just a few more seconds!

16:21.981 --> 16:23.650
Son of a bitch.

16:28.196 --> 16:29.739
- Got it!
- Yes!

16:29.781 --> 16:30.990
- It might take me a while
to crack it, though.

16:31.032 --> 16:32.784
It's encrypted.
[phone buzzes]

16:32.826 --> 16:35.453
- Go for Grubs.
- Son, are you okay?

16:35.495 --> 16:37.038
Your face is all over the news.

16:37.080 --> 16:39.374
- I promise you, Dad,
it's all horsepucky.

16:39.416 --> 16:40.667
- I know.

16:40.709 --> 16:42.043
You could never
do something like this.

16:42.085 --> 16:44.754
- Thanks, Dad.
But I think I know who did.

16:44.796 --> 16:47.090
Have you ever heard
of an "The Architect?"

16:47.132 --> 16:49.843
- Can't say I have.
Where'd you get that intel?

16:49.884 --> 16:52.178
- Stopped by the pen today
and had a little chat

16:52.220 --> 16:53.680
with Barrett Fasoose.

16:53.722 --> 16:55.765
We're at the NSA right now
working his lead.

16:55.807 --> 16:57.517
- No, you gotta
get out of there!

16:57.559 --> 17:01.354
Don't you see? This is a trap.
Fasoose is setting you up!

17:01.396 --> 17:04.190
- I appreciate your concern,
but we're right on the verge

17:04.232 --> 17:05.859
of blowing this thing
wide open.

17:05.900 --> 17:08.570
Then we can go to Kernst
and get back on the mission.

17:08.611 --> 17:11.489
- Wait, Kernst is
running things now?

17:11.531 --> 17:14.117
- Yeah.
- God.

17:14.159 --> 17:17.954
MacGruber, that's your guy.
Kernst is your Architect.

17:17.996 --> 17:19.581
- Daddy, I seriously
doubt that--

17:19.622 --> 17:22.167
- Trust me, son.
It has to be Kernst.

17:22.208 --> 17:24.252
Now, listen,
you gotta get out of there.

17:24.294 --> 17:25.628
You're in real danger.

17:25.670 --> 17:27.255
- Guys, I think we got
some movement over here.

17:27.297 --> 17:28.798
- Shit. Dad, hold on.

17:28.840 --> 17:29.883
- Okay, I'm gonna copy
the files to the drive,

17:29.924 --> 17:31.509
but they're really big ones.

17:31.551 --> 17:33.428
- Please go!
- Hang on, Dad. Hang on.

17:33.470 --> 17:34.929
- Okay.

17:34.971 --> 17:38.641
Just gotta drag,
drop this one over here.

17:38.683 --> 17:43.146
Drag it. Drop it.

17:43.188 --> 17:44.397
Drag it.

17:44.439 --> 17:46.983
- Hang on, she's just
dragging and dropping.

17:47.025 --> 17:49.569
- Drag it. Whoop.

17:49.611 --> 17:52.489
Drag it. Drop it.

17:52.530 --> 17:54.032
- Shit.

17:54.074 --> 17:55.825
[tense music]

17:55.867 --> 17:56.951
- Shit, we got company.

17:56.993 --> 17:58.703
- Okay, sorry, Dad, gotta jump.

17:58.745 --> 18:00.580
The pigs are porking it
up over here.

18:00.622 --> 18:02.499
- MacGruber!

18:02.540 --> 18:03.875
- Just a few more seconds!

18:03.917 --> 18:05.418
- We don't have
a few more seconds!

18:05.460 --> 18:06.628
- Okay. But the flash drive!

18:06.670 --> 18:08.254
- Just leave it!

18:09.798 --> 18:11.716
This will buy us some time.

18:11.758 --> 18:13.385
[alarm blaring]

18:13.426 --> 18:14.803
Go! Go!

Oh, my leg! Oh, fuck!

Good call on the water thing,
Piper.

Always playing checkers.

18:36.241 --> 18:37.534
Oh, fuck! Go, go, go!

18:37.575 --> 18:40.578
I'll meet you at the SUV!
Go, Vicki! Go!

18:40.620 --> 18:44.082
- MacGruber!
- Oh, fuck!

18:44.124 --> 18:46.126
[groaning]

18:46.167 --> 18:47.252
Ahh!

18:47.293 --> 18:50.213
[dramatic music]

18:50.255 --> 18:54.384
* *

18:54.426 --> 18:56.386
- MacGruber, stop.

18:56.428 --> 18:58.221
I said stop!

18:58.263 --> 18:59.973
[gunshot]

19:01.725 --> 19:03.810
Don't move a muscle.

19:07.230 --> 19:08.690
- Well, Major...

19:10.191 --> 19:12.527
I guess you caught me
if you could.

19:12.569 --> 19:15.238
- I guess I did,
Colonel Jebblidoo.

19:15.280 --> 19:18.867
- You son of a bitch.
My dad warned me about you.

19:18.908 --> 19:20.660
You're nothing
but a silver-tongued

19:20.702 --> 19:22.120
snake oil salesman,

19:22.162 --> 19:24.664
saying whatever it takes
to keep up the fucking grift.

19:24.706 --> 19:28.043
You know what, I wish I had a
fucking sledgehammer right now

19:28.084 --> 19:30.420
so I could splatter your brains
against the fucking wall

19:30.462 --> 19:31.796
in a million pieces,

19:31.838 --> 19:33.256
one for each of those
innocent people

19:33.298 --> 19:36.051
who lost their lives
in Ecuador because of you!

19:37.218 --> 19:38.178
- Are you done?

19:38.219 --> 19:40.305
- Oh, I haven't even
started yet.

19:42.307 --> 19:44.893
- Well, let me know
when you are,

19:44.934 --> 19:46.186
so I can give you this.

19:47.645 --> 19:49.064
- Vicki's hard drive.

19:50.523 --> 19:52.776
I-I don't understand.

19:52.817 --> 19:54.694
- Found it
in our evidence room.

19:54.736 --> 19:57.822
We can't crack the files,
but maybe you can.

19:57.864 --> 20:00.408
[heartfelt music]

20:00.450 --> 20:04.245
Come on, Mac.
We're on the same team here.

20:04.287 --> 20:10.669
* *

20:14.506 --> 20:15.965
- Why are you doing this?

20:17.133 --> 20:21.054
- I, um, I lost my mom too.

20:23.181 --> 20:25.392
- I'm sorry.

20:25.433 --> 20:26.685
What was her name?

20:27.644 --> 20:29.062
- Elizabeth.

20:31.064 --> 20:32.816
- Darcy.

20:34.651 --> 20:35.985
What was her middle name?

20:36.027 --> 20:37.070
- Look, Mac,
you don't have much time.

20:37.112 --> 20:38.571
- Yes, no, you're right.
Yes.

20:38.613 --> 20:42.325
- You take that, and you go
find that son of a bitch.

20:42.367 --> 20:43.910
- I will.

20:43.952 --> 20:51.084
* *

21:09.019 --> 21:11.271
- Are you okay?

21:11.312 --> 21:13.398
- It just doesn't
make any sense.

21:13.440 --> 21:17.318
I mean, my dad was so sure
that Kernst was the Architect.

21:17.360 --> 21:21.322
And my dad is just like me--
he doesn't make mistakes.

21:22.490 --> 21:25.285
Hell, maybe Kernst
is just playing me.

21:25.326 --> 21:28.621
Maybe this is all just
one big long con.

21:28.663 --> 21:30.915
But why?

21:30.957 --> 21:34.544
[sighs]
Something just doesn't add up.

21:34.586 --> 21:38.173
What's the play here?
What's the fucking play?

21:43.428 --> 21:45.096
- Oh, my God.

21:46.222 --> 21:48.850
- MacGruber! Did you just toot?

21:48.892 --> 21:51.269
- Nice try, Vic,
but you know as well as I do

21:51.311 --> 21:53.396
that whoever smelt it
dealt it.

21:53.438 --> 21:56.316
[mysterious music]

21:56.358 --> 21:58.401
Whoever smelt it...

21:59.861 --> 22:01.946
Dealt it.

Oh. My. God.

22:10.080 --> 22:11.581
[dramatic music]

22:11.623 --> 22:14.584

Whoever smelt it dealt it.

Whoever smelt it dealt it.
