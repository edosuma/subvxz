00:01.919 --> 00:04.630
Previously

00:01.919 --> 00:04.630
on  Malcolm in the Middle...

00:01.919 --> 00:04.630
I love you.

00:04.672 --> 00:05.840
I want to break up.

00:05.881 --> 00:08.300
DRILL SERGEANT:

00:05.881 --> 00:08.300
Welcome to the US Army!

00:08.342 --> 00:09.718
You are not

00:08.342 --> 00:09.718
going to lie

00:09.760 --> 00:12.053
to put someone in jail

00:09.760 --> 00:12.053
who might be innocent.

00:12.095 --> 00:13.848
Can't he at least

00:12.095 --> 00:13.848
put some pants on?

00:13.889 --> 00:17.058
Just as soon as we

00:13.889 --> 00:17.058
get a good perp walk

00:13.889 --> 00:17.058
out of him.

00:17.100 --> 00:18.644
MAN:

00:17.100 --> 00:18.644
Your court order says you have

00:18.686 --> 00:20.103
to stay within

00:18.686 --> 00:20.103
a 50-foot radius.

00:20.145 --> 00:22.731
My drill sergeant's breath

00:20.145 --> 00:22.731
is not my concern!

00:22.773 --> 00:23.691
I know you're innocent,

00:23.732 --> 00:24.859
and I can prove it.

00:24.900 --> 00:25.526
Just make sure you stay

00:25.567 --> 00:26.861
within 30 feet of this backpack.

00:26.902 --> 00:28.654
I want you to explain

00:26.902 --> 00:28.654
to these recruits

00:28.696 --> 00:30.155
how the worst soldier

00:28.696 --> 00:30.155
in the unit

00:30.197 --> 00:32.073
has managed to put

00:30.197 --> 00:32.073
them all to shame.

00:32.115 --> 00:33.868
I just stopped thinking.

00:33.909 --> 00:35.243
I'm the world's

00:33.909 --> 00:35.243
happiest tool.

00:35.285 --> 00:38.079
Mom, you've been in

00:35.285 --> 00:38.079
there for three hours!

00:38.121 --> 00:40.081
LOIS:

00:38.121 --> 00:40.081
In a minute. I'm in the shower!

00:40.123 --> 00:41.959
I think we got a bomb here.

00:42.001 --> 00:43.084
Sir, I need you to step away

00:43.126 --> 00:45.004
to a distance

00:43.126 --> 00:45.004
of at least 150 feet.

00:45.044 --> 00:46.087
I can't do that.

00:46.129 --> 00:48.256
I'm... I'm...

00:48.298 --> 00:50.718
I'm in the bomb squad.

OFFICER (over bullhorn):

01:31.174 --> 01:32.342
You're not alone.

01:32.384 --> 01:35.178
We've called every

01:32.384 --> 01:35.178
available police officer

01:35.220 --> 01:38.306
in the Tri-County area.

01:38.348 --> 01:40.183
Are you sure

01:38.348 --> 01:40.183
you don't need

01:38.348 --> 01:40.183
any equipment?

01:40.225 --> 01:42.185
We've got some

01:40.225 --> 01:42.185
needle-nose pliers.

01:42.227 --> 01:44.145
No! Stay away!

01:44.187 --> 01:45.814
Everyone has to stay away!

01:45.856 --> 01:49.651
This thing is picking up

01:45.856 --> 01:49.651
a lot of vibrations right now.

01:49.693 --> 01:51.152
I said get back.

01:51.194 --> 01:52.529
Do you have a death wish,

01:51.194 --> 01:52.529
Officer?

01:52.571 --> 01:54.322
I'm Lieutenant Sortino

01:52.571 --> 01:54.322
with the bomb squad.

01:54.364 --> 01:56.241
I'm here to help.

01:54.364 --> 01:56.241
What's your name?

01:56.283 --> 01:57.952
No time for introductions.

01:57.993 --> 01:59.244
We've got a level five explosive

01:59.286 --> 02:02.623
with a gravity timer

01:59.286 --> 02:02.623
and a percussion fuse.

02:02.664 --> 02:05.667
What bomb squad

02:02.664 --> 02:05.667
did you say you were with?

02:05.709 --> 02:06.961
Millbrook.

02:07.002 --> 02:07.753
I'm off duty.

02:07.795 --> 02:09.170
Came by to return

02:07.795 --> 02:09.170
a library book.

02:09.212 --> 02:10.338
You've got a better

02:09.212 --> 02:10.338
selection here.

02:10.380 --> 02:12.549
And they charge 50 cents a day

02:10.380 --> 02:12.549
back home.

02:12.591 --> 02:14.217
Now, I know the fines help pay

02:14.259 --> 02:16.177
for the place,

02:14.259 --> 02:16.177
but that's really

02:16.219 --> 02:17.638
a very small part of the budget.

02:17.679 --> 02:20.975
Now, if we are finished

02:17.679 --> 02:20.975
playing 20 questions,

02:21.016 --> 02:23.268
I've got lives to save.

02:24.436 --> 02:27.773
Since you guys seem

02:24.436 --> 02:27.773
more up to date in Millbrook,

02:27.815 --> 02:30.067
I'm just going to go call

02:27.815 --> 02:30.067
your supervisor,

02:30.109 --> 02:31.276
see if he can send

02:30.109 --> 02:31.276
some backup.

02:31.318 --> 02:33.361
Hoo-hoo! Sure.

02:33.403 --> 02:36.782
If you can find him.

02:33.403 --> 02:36.782
(chuckling)

02:36.824 --> 02:39.660
(indistinct police radio

02:36.824 --> 02:39.660
transmissions)

02:39.701 --> 02:45.833
Okay, I'm going to try

02:39.701 --> 02:45.833
to detach the coaxial...

02:47.167 --> 02:48.209
(screeches):

02:47.167 --> 02:48.209
Oh, no!

02:48.251 --> 02:49.837
I cut the wrong wire!

02:51.046 --> 02:52.131
It's gonna blow!

02:52.171 --> 02:54.424
Tell my wife I love her!

02:55.174 --> 02:56.217
Five!

02:56.259 --> 02:57.218
Four!

02:57.260 --> 02:58.720
Three!

02:58.762 --> 02:59.596
Two!

02:59.638 --> 03:01.306
One!

03:13.986 --> 03:16.864
See? You don't need

03:13.986 --> 03:16.864
grocery money if

03:13.986 --> 03:16.864
you're creative.

03:16.905 --> 03:19.407
I wish I had better

03:16.905 --> 03:19.407
news for you, Hal,

03:16.905 --> 03:19.407
but the prosecution

03:19.449 --> 03:21.827
has 30 eyewitnesses

03:19.449 --> 03:21.827
that can all avoid

03:21.869 --> 03:24.955
going to prison themselves

03:21.869 --> 03:24.955
by fingering you.

03:24.997 --> 03:26.623
How about my mystery guy?

03:26.665 --> 03:28.249
He's only got

03:26.665 --> 03:28.249
six months to live.

03:28.291 --> 03:30.293
He doesn't want to die

03:28.291 --> 03:30.293
with a guilty conscience.

03:30.335 --> 03:32.253
He's gonna completely

03:30.335 --> 03:32.253
exonerate me.

03:32.295 --> 03:33.714
And he's not imaginary.

03:33.755 --> 03:35.256
This is pretty much

03:33.755 --> 03:35.256
how things

03:35.298 --> 03:37.258
have been going

03:35.298 --> 03:37.258
around here lately.

03:37.300 --> 03:38.635
Dad's trial starts tomorrow,

03:38.677 --> 03:40.637
we still have no idea

03:38.677 --> 03:40.637
where Reese is,

03:40.679 --> 03:42.764
and Mom kind of had

03:40.679 --> 03:42.764
a breakdown.

03:42.806 --> 03:45.642
It's okay. She's slowly

03:42.806 --> 03:45.642
working her way back.

03:45.684 --> 03:48.311
I think her new hobby's

03:45.684 --> 03:48.311
helping her.

03:50.939 --> 03:53.274
This one's name

03:50.939 --> 03:53.274
is Sam Gundlebumps.

03:53.316 --> 03:57.278
He grew up on a farm

03:53.316 --> 03:57.278
where he was friends

03:53.316 --> 03:57.278
with a turkey and a duck.

03:57.320 --> 04:00.448
He can't see very well, so

03:57.320 --> 04:00.448
he's always getting lost.

04:00.490 --> 04:01.533
It'll be okay, Lois.

04:01.575 --> 04:03.284
We're gonna find Reese.

04:03.326 --> 04:05.495
(gasps):

04:03.326 --> 04:05.495
Look, he picked flowers.

04:05.537 --> 04:08.415
He's going a-courtin'.

04:09.416 --> 04:11.292
Right face!

04:11.334 --> 04:12.293
Left face!

04:12.335 --> 04:14.295
About face!

04:14.337 --> 04:15.214
Right arm windmill!

04:15.255 --> 04:17.298
Hop on your left foot!

04:17.340 --> 04:19.885
Teapot!

04:19.927 --> 04:21.302
About face!

04:21.344 --> 04:23.513
Forward march!

04:27.142 --> 04:28.894
He'll do that all day.

04:28.936 --> 04:31.563
He's got no more

04:28.936 --> 04:31.563
thought than a bug.

04:31.605 --> 04:33.314
It's almost enough

04:31.605 --> 04:33.314
to restore my faith

04:33.356 --> 04:34.315
in the future of this army.

04:34.357 --> 04:36.818
I guess those subliminal ads

04:34.357 --> 04:36.818
are working after all.

04:36.860 --> 04:39.196
The army doesn't

04:36.860 --> 04:39.196
use subliminal ads.

04:39.238 --> 04:41.990
(Reese bumping wall repeatedly)

04:42.032 --> 04:43.575
At ease!

04:45.368 --> 04:47.328
Now, in a few days

04:45.368 --> 04:47.328
we have some

04:47.370 --> 04:49.497
very important

04:47.370 --> 04:49.497
field training exercises,

04:49.539 --> 04:52.333
and I want  you

04:49.539 --> 04:52.333
to be my number two,

04:52.375 --> 04:53.961
because you will obey

04:52.375 --> 04:53.961
my every command

04:54.002 --> 04:56.713
like some kind of beautiful,

04:54.002 --> 04:56.713
brainless zombie robot.

04:56.755 --> 04:58.339
I'd be honored, Drill Sergeant.

04:58.381 --> 04:59.716
Now let's go make

04:58.381 --> 04:59.716
some bets

04:59.758 --> 05:01.969
and march you

04:59.758 --> 05:01.969
into the electric fence.

05:03.303 --> 05:05.346
WOMAN:

05:03.303 --> 05:05.346
I saw the defendant

05:05.388 --> 05:07.515
hack through

05:05.388 --> 05:07.515
the proxy server's firewall,

05:07.557 --> 05:10.727
and delete the SPE files

05:07.557 --> 05:10.727
without leaving any tracks.

05:10.769 --> 05:12.562
I didn't totally understand it,

05:12.604 --> 05:13.981
but he said the

05:12.604 --> 05:13.981
dummy corporation

05:14.022 --> 05:17.025
could be used to launder

05:14.022 --> 05:17.025
all the money we siphoned off.

05:17.985 --> 05:20.154
You can threaten

05:17.985 --> 05:20.154
my children all you want!

05:20.195 --> 05:21.238
I don't care!

05:21.280 --> 05:23.198
I have to tell the truth!

05:25.867 --> 05:30.371
(mouthing)

05:31.414 --> 05:33.374
For God's sakes,

05:31.414 --> 05:33.374
do something.

05:33.416 --> 05:34.542
Just be patient.

05:34.584 --> 05:37.378
There's such a thing

05:34.584 --> 05:37.378
as too much evidence.

05:37.420 --> 05:40.257
Eventually they'll get bored.

05:40.299 --> 05:42.217
The prosecution

05:40.299 --> 05:42.217
calls Gordon Walker.

05:45.304 --> 05:47.097
That's him.

05:45.304 --> 05:47.097
That's my guy.

05:51.601 --> 05:53.979
I was worried about what

05:51.601 --> 05:53.979
I would say when I got up here,

05:54.021 --> 05:55.189
but deep down, I knew

05:55.230 --> 05:57.398
I would have to tell the truth.

05:57.440 --> 05:59.860
There's a conspiracy

05:57.440 --> 05:59.860
going on here,

05:59.901 --> 06:01.987
and it's all been orchestrated

06:02.029 --> 06:03.322
by that man.

06:03.362 --> 06:05.866
(gallery murmuring)

06:05.907 --> 06:09.870
(whispering):

06:05.907 --> 06:09.870
Is he pointing at someone

06:05.907 --> 06:09.870
directly behind me?

06:11.038 --> 06:13.332
And after he shredded

06:11.038 --> 06:13.332
the last of the documents,

06:13.372 --> 06:14.415
he delivered the punch line

06:14.457 --> 06:16.877
to yet another

06:14.457 --> 06:16.877
racist joke.

06:17.669 --> 06:18.837
PROSECUTOR:

06:17.669 --> 06:18.837
No further questions.

06:21.631 --> 06:23.342
Turns out I'm gonna live.

06:23.382 --> 06:25.719
They had the wrong X ray.

06:25.760 --> 06:27.637
Boy, when you've had

06:25.760 --> 06:27.637
a scare like mine,

06:27.679 --> 06:29.472
you realize what's

06:27.679 --> 06:29.472
really important--

06:29.514 --> 06:31.099
staying out of jail.

06:31.141 --> 06:32.433
Good luck.

06:44.487 --> 06:46.365
MALCOLM:

06:44.487 --> 06:46.365
With this many people lying,

06:46.405 --> 06:48.825
we've got to be able

06:46.405 --> 06:48.825
to find something

06:46.405 --> 06:48.825
to trip one of them up.

06:48.867 --> 06:50.660
Let's not get

06:48.867 --> 06:50.660
our hopes up.

06:52.371 --> 06:54.081
Mom, I know you've

06:52.371 --> 06:54.081
had a rough time

06:54.122 --> 06:57.625
and that your little

06:54.122 --> 06:57.625
projects are very

06:54.122 --> 06:57.625
therapeutic for you,

06:57.667 --> 06:59.627
but Dad is in very big trouble.

06:59.669 --> 07:01.462
You have to start helping.

07:01.504 --> 07:02.964
Honey, I know this is a crisis,

07:03.006 --> 07:05.633
and believe me,

07:03.006 --> 07:05.633
I'm doing everything I can.

07:05.675 --> 07:08.469
I spent extra money

07:05.675 --> 07:08.469
on quick-drying glue,

07:08.511 --> 07:11.056
so no matter how you shake it,

07:08.511 --> 07:11.056
the sequins won't fall off.

07:11.098 --> 07:12.473
After what happened

07:11.098 --> 07:12.473
at Compulsories,

07:12.515 --> 07:16.311
Rebecca's really got to nail

07:12.515 --> 07:16.311
her long program.

07:23.235 --> 07:25.904
Those flour bombs

07:23.235 --> 07:25.904
just don't do it for me.

07:25.946 --> 07:28.489
I miss the old days

07:25.946 --> 07:28.489
when we got to use

07:25.946 --> 07:28.489
live ordnance.

07:28.531 --> 07:30.367
That looked like the movies.

07:31.243 --> 07:32.286
Tell your men advance

07:32.327 --> 07:33.328
northwest, 20 meters.

07:33.370 --> 07:35.747
Advance northwest, 20 meters!

07:35.789 --> 07:37.498
North-northeast,

07:35.789 --> 07:37.498
five meters!

07:37.540 --> 07:39.793
North-northeast, five meters!

07:41.544 --> 07:44.505
(beeping)

07:41.544 --> 07:44.505
Crap. I'm hit!

07:44.547 --> 07:46.507
I'm gonna go die

07:44.547 --> 07:46.507
over here in the shade.

07:46.549 --> 07:47.884
Get to the rendezvous point!

07:47.926 --> 07:50.178
Bravo, lay down cover fire!

07:47.926 --> 07:50.178
Alpha, flank right.

07:50.220 --> 07:53.307
Get to the rendezvous point!

07:50.220 --> 07:53.307
Bravo, lay down cover fire.

07:53.348 --> 07:54.766
Alpha, flank right!

07:54.808 --> 07:55.683
You are really showing

07:55.725 --> 07:57.394
leadership, soldier!

07:57.436 --> 07:59.271
I am really

07:57.436 --> 07:59.271
showing leadership!

08:00.605 --> 08:02.357
(man screaming)

08:02.399 --> 08:04.401
I'm allergic to wheat products!

08:05.568 --> 08:06.694
This is going

08:05.568 --> 08:06.694
to be awesome.

08:06.736 --> 08:07.779
You've got

08:06.736 --> 08:07.779
to watch this.

08:07.821 --> 08:09.114
He swells up

08:07.821 --> 08:09.114
like a balloon.

08:09.156 --> 08:10.573
Hey!

08:10.615 --> 08:12.951
We got a vehicle

08:10.615 --> 08:12.951
from Blue Team approaching.

08:12.993 --> 08:13.701
Squad Leader!

08:13.743 --> 08:15.120
Intercept that vehicle!

08:15.162 --> 08:16.663
Yes, Sergeant!

08:20.000 --> 08:21.376
Oh, no!

08:22.836 --> 08:26.673
Oh, my God, are you okay?

08:29.592 --> 08:31.261
God, I  love  that boy.

08:31.303 --> 08:34.806
More Blue Team vehicles

08:31.303 --> 08:34.806
approaching-- should we run?

08:35.807 --> 08:38.435
Sergeant! Sergeant!

08:38.477 --> 08:39.560
Forget the sergeant!

08:39.602 --> 08:40.728
Just say we can run!

08:40.770 --> 08:42.481
Sergeant? Sergeant?

08:42.563 --> 08:44.565
Idiot! Move!

08:44.607 --> 08:45.942
Reese! Come on!

08:45.984 --> 08:47.361
Can we go?!

08:47.402 --> 08:49.279
Sergeant? Sergeant?

08:52.615 --> 08:54.784
Sergeant? Sergeant?

08:59.622 --> 09:00.999
Sergeant?

09:06.338 --> 09:09.424
Ladies and gentlemen, you have

09:06.338 --> 09:09.424
heard a staggering amount

09:09.466 --> 09:10.758
of evidence

09:09.466 --> 09:10.758
against the defendant.

09:10.800 --> 09:12.760
Let me clarify what we now know.

09:12.802 --> 09:14.637
Three members of

09:12.802 --> 09:14.637
the board of directors

09:14.679 --> 09:16.056
testified that the defendant

09:16.097 --> 09:19.767
submitted altered financial

09:16.097 --> 09:19.767
statements on August 9.

09:19.809 --> 09:20.977
The Senior VP of Finance

09:21.019 --> 09:23.063
heard the defendant plot to hide

09:23.104 --> 09:26.607
company assets offshore

09:23.104 --> 09:26.607
on December 6.

09:26.649 --> 09:27.984
The Chief Operations Officer

09:28.026 --> 09:29.777
saw him shredding documents

09:28.026 --> 09:29.777
in a stairwell

09:29.819 --> 09:31.612
on February 21.

09:31.654 --> 09:34.991
And on June 27,

09:31.654 --> 09:34.991
the Director of IT Services

09:35.033 --> 09:36.910
testified that the defendant

09:36.951 --> 09:39.454
showed him pictures

09:36.951 --> 09:39.454
of his new yacht

09:39.496 --> 09:42.916
which he named  Above the Law.

09:43.666 --> 09:45.460
And, on July 11,

09:45.502 --> 09:48.004
you heard the Senior Analyst

09:48.046 --> 09:50.048
break down in tears

09:48.046 --> 09:50.048
as he revealed

09:50.090 --> 09:51.216
(snoring)

09:50.090 --> 09:51.216
the defendant's scheme

09:51.258 --> 09:52.633
to bilk the company

09:51.258 --> 09:52.633
out of millions...

09:52.675 --> 09:54.428
What are you

09:52.675 --> 09:54.428
doing?

09:54.469 --> 09:56.679
Shh. I'm awake.

09:56.721 --> 10:00.517
I'm trying to get you

09:56.721 --> 10:00.517
grounds for an appeal.

10:00.559 --> 10:01.851
(snoring)

10:06.273 --> 10:08.649
Mom?

10:06.273 --> 10:08.649
Are you coming out for dinner?

10:08.691 --> 10:10.902
I'm just taking

10:08.691 --> 10:10.902
Penelope's temperature.

10:10.944 --> 10:13.321
I think she caught

10:10.944 --> 10:13.321
Ambrosia's cold.

10:13.363 --> 10:15.656
Is Penelope

10:13.363 --> 10:15.656
the foreign correspondent

10:15.698 --> 10:17.658
or the candy striper?

10:17.700 --> 10:20.661
No, she's just

10:17.700 --> 10:20.661
a homemaker,

10:20.703 --> 10:22.038
but a big candy

10:20.703 --> 10:22.038
company's

10:22.080 --> 10:24.583
interested in her

10:22.080 --> 10:24.583
taffy recipe.

10:24.624 --> 10:25.666
Can I have the potatoes?

10:25.708 --> 10:28.044
You can have anything

10:25.708 --> 10:28.044
you want, son,

10:28.086 --> 10:30.464
if you're willing

10:28.086 --> 10:30.464
to work for it.

10:30.505 --> 10:32.382
Just reach

10:30.505 --> 10:32.382
for the stars

10:32.424 --> 10:33.467
and never let go.

10:33.508 --> 10:35.927
I should have told you that

10:33.508 --> 10:35.927
a long time ago.

10:35.969 --> 10:38.679
And when you write

10:35.969 --> 10:38.679
an angry letter,

10:38.721 --> 10:40.056
hold onto it

10:38.721 --> 10:40.056
for a day.

10:40.098 --> 10:41.766
You might not feel the

10:40.098 --> 10:41.766
same in the morning.

10:41.808 --> 10:43.602
And never invest

10:43.643 --> 10:45.686
in a friend's

10:43.643 --> 10:45.686
restaurant. Never.

10:45.728 --> 10:47.314
You know what?

10:47.355 --> 10:48.356
I'm not hungry.

10:48.398 --> 10:49.690
Come on, Dewey,

10:48.398 --> 10:49.690
let's go teach you

10:49.732 --> 10:50.775
how to shave.

10:52.319 --> 10:53.694
Great!

10:53.736 --> 10:55.696
When you

10:53.736 --> 10:55.696
tip a valet,

10:55.738 --> 10:57.491
always fold your

10:55.738 --> 10:57.491
dollar up real tight.

10:57.532 --> 10:59.618
That way, by the time

10:57.532 --> 10:59.618
he sees what he's got,

10:59.659 --> 11:00.743
you're down

10:59.659 --> 11:00.743
the block.

11:02.329 --> 11:03.913
(sobbing)

11:03.955 --> 11:04.789
Dad?

11:04.831 --> 11:06.583
I made coffee. You want some?

11:06.625 --> 11:07.708
Oh, hi.

11:07.750 --> 11:08.960
I was just singing.

11:09.002 --> 11:11.463
Always have a song

11:09.002 --> 11:11.463
in your heart, son.

11:12.755 --> 11:14.424
Thanks.

11:14.466 --> 11:15.800
(sighs)

11:15.842 --> 11:17.718
You know what

11:15.842 --> 11:17.718
the worst thing is?

11:17.760 --> 11:20.514
I have always

11:17.760 --> 11:20.514
hated that job.

11:20.555 --> 11:21.306
I wanted to quit

11:21.348 --> 11:22.974
ten years ago

11:21.348 --> 11:22.974
when they started

11:23.016 --> 11:24.559
deducting for sick days.

11:24.601 --> 11:25.726
I wanted to quit

11:24.601 --> 11:25.726
a year ago

11:25.768 --> 11:26.936
when they started making us

11:26.978 --> 11:28.729
vacuum out our own cubicles.

11:28.771 --> 11:30.190
If I'd have

11:28.771 --> 11:30.190
done that,

11:30.231 --> 11:31.899
they would have

11:30.231 --> 11:31.899
found another patsy

11:31.941 --> 11:33.734
and I wouldn't have been

11:31.941 --> 11:33.734
in this mess.

11:33.776 --> 11:35.654
They should have just fired me.

11:36.695 --> 11:38.573
I was a terrible employee.

11:38.615 --> 11:39.824
I never read a memo,

11:39.866 --> 11:42.410
I came in late,

11:39.866 --> 11:42.410
I blew off Fridays.

11:42.452 --> 11:45.372
What the hell is wrong

11:42.452 --> 11:45.372
with those people?

11:46.498 --> 11:47.915
Just promise me

11:47.957 --> 11:50.001
that you'll learn

11:47.957 --> 11:50.001
from my mistakes.

11:50.043 --> 11:52.753
Don't ever settle, Malcolm.

11:52.795 --> 11:54.506
I won't.

11:56.715 --> 12:01.179
I'm going to go make love

11:56.715 --> 12:01.179
to your mother one last time.

12:02.305 --> 12:05.642
I probably wasn't going

12:02.305 --> 12:05.642
to sleep tonight anyway.

12:06.809 --> 12:08.186
Malcolm, we have to talk.

12:09.646 --> 12:10.813
We've been avoiding

12:09.646 --> 12:10.813
this, but it's

12:10.855 --> 12:12.357
time to face the facts.

12:12.399 --> 12:14.775
We need you to forge Dad's

12:12.399 --> 12:14.775
signature on this document

12:14.817 --> 12:16.653
declaring Mom

12:14.817 --> 12:16.653
mentally incompetent.

12:16.695 --> 12:17.778
That way, when Dad

12:16.695 --> 12:17.778
goes to jail,

12:17.820 --> 12:18.863
you can get emancipated

12:18.905 --> 12:21.491
and I'll take custody

12:18.905 --> 12:21.491
of Dewey and Jamie.

12:21.533 --> 12:23.034
It's funny.

12:23.076 --> 12:26.413
I always figured Mom for jail

12:23.076 --> 12:26.413
and Dad for the loony bin.

12:26.454 --> 12:27.706
Life, huh?

12:27.746 --> 12:29.790
I can't fake

12:27.746 --> 12:29.790
Dad's signature.

12:29.832 --> 12:32.210
I do Mom.

12:29.832 --> 12:32.210
Reese does Dad.

12:32.252 --> 12:33.086
What?

12:33.127 --> 12:34.795
You should each

12:33.127 --> 12:34.795
be able to do both.

12:34.837 --> 12:36.214
What did I tell you

12:34.837 --> 12:36.214
about building

12:36.256 --> 12:37.882
a little redundancy

12:36.256 --> 12:37.882
into the system?

12:37.924 --> 12:40.009
Wait a second.

12:40.759 --> 12:41.928
Oh, my God.

12:41.969 --> 12:44.055
What is it?

12:41.969 --> 12:44.055
I need to talk to Dad right now.

12:47.016 --> 12:49.810
Maybe I'll wait 20 minutes.

12:49.852 --> 12:52.188
What were your

12:49.852 --> 12:52.188
orders, Private?!

12:52.230 --> 12:53.814
I don't know.

12:52.230 --> 12:53.814
Ask the sergeant.

12:53.856 --> 12:55.816
Tell us your call signs

12:53.856 --> 12:55.816
and frequencies!

12:55.858 --> 12:57.736
I don't know.

12:55.858 --> 12:57.736
Ask the sergeant.

12:57.776 --> 12:58.903
We don't have

12:57.776 --> 12:58.903
to do this

12:58.945 --> 13:00.071
the hard way.

13:00.113 --> 13:01.864
Let's all take

13:00.113 --> 13:01.864
a break

13:01.906 --> 13:03.658
and relax

13:01.906 --> 13:03.658
a little.

13:03.700 --> 13:06.077
You want a glass

13:03.700 --> 13:06.077
of water?

13:06.119 --> 13:08.622
I don't know.

13:06.119 --> 13:08.622
Ask the sergeant.

13:08.663 --> 13:09.830
Stop saying that!

13:09.872 --> 13:11.416
This may not be a real war,

13:11.458 --> 13:13.293
but I got an extra day's leave

13:11.458 --> 13:13.293
riding on this,

13:13.334 --> 13:15.128
and a girlfriend

13:13.334 --> 13:15.128
who is in model school.

13:15.712 --> 13:17.088
Model school!

13:17.130 --> 13:19.882
Now you will talk or I will make

13:17.130 --> 13:19.882
your life a living hell!

13:19.924 --> 13:21.342
You don't think I want to?!

13:21.384 --> 13:22.843
This sucks!

13:21.384 --> 13:22.843
I've been a good soldier!

13:22.885 --> 13:25.430
I shut off my brain

13:22.885 --> 13:25.430
like the Army wanted.

13:25.472 --> 13:27.641
Everyone said I was

13:25.472 --> 13:27.641
doing great, but I'm not!

13:27.682 --> 13:28.891
I have to help my squad.

13:28.933 --> 13:30.435
The guys are depending on me,

13:28.933 --> 13:30.435
but I can't!

13:30.477 --> 13:32.562
You know what?

13:30.477 --> 13:32.562
I don't care what the Army says.

13:32.604 --> 13:34.021
I'm sick of this!

13:34.063 --> 13:35.523
I'm turning my brain back on!

13:39.902 --> 13:41.362
Did it happen?

13:42.530 --> 13:43.657
Did what happen?

13:43.698 --> 13:44.865
Wait...

13:44.907 --> 13:46.493
I think it's...

13:46.534 --> 13:48.869
No, it's not.

13:48.911 --> 13:50.871
Yes, it is.

13:50.913 --> 13:52.248
Is it?

13:52.290 --> 13:54.292
Damn, I wish there was

13:52.290 --> 13:54.292
more of a difference.

13:54.334 --> 13:56.127
Look, you can act

13:54.334 --> 13:56.127
as crazy as you'd like,

13:56.169 --> 13:57.796
'cause I got nothing but time.

13:57.836 --> 13:59.172
And no one's coming

13:57.836 --> 13:59.172
to rescue you.

13:59.213 --> 14:00.881
Not your sergeant,

13:59.213 --> 14:00.881
not your squad,

14:00.923 --> 14:02.175
and your mama's

14:00.923 --> 14:02.175
not going to come

14:02.216 --> 14:04.302
and wipe your nose

14:02.216 --> 14:04.302
and change your diaper.

14:07.305 --> 14:08.807
Mom.

14:08.847 --> 14:10.809
Mom. Of course.

14:10.849 --> 14:13.102
(inhales deeply)

14:15.563 --> 14:16.606
Freak held

14:15.563 --> 14:16.606
his breath

14:16.648 --> 14:18.733
until he turned blue

14:16.648 --> 14:18.733
and then passed out.

14:22.654 --> 14:24.280
Yeah! Whoo!

14:24.322 --> 14:25.906
Haven't done that in a while.

14:25.948 --> 14:27.784
You okay?

14:25.948 --> 14:27.784
I'm fine.

14:27.826 --> 14:29.577
I know how to get us

14:27.826 --> 14:29.577
out of here.

14:29.619 --> 14:32.079
That's impossible. Look around.

14:29.619 --> 14:32.079
We're in prison, man.

14:32.121 --> 14:35.291
Wrong. We are not in prison.

14:32.121 --> 14:35.291
We're grounded.

14:35.333 --> 14:37.502
And there's always a way

14:35.333 --> 14:37.502
to get out of being grounded.

14:37.544 --> 14:39.170
You can pry up

14:37.544 --> 14:39.170
some floorboards...

14:39.962 --> 14:41.130
set your bed on fire.

14:41.172 --> 14:43.257
There's only two things

14:41.172 --> 14:43.257
you have to remember.

14:43.966 --> 14:45.092
You need a diversion

14:45.134 --> 14:47.345
and the little guy

14:45.134 --> 14:47.345
gets screwed.

14:47.387 --> 14:48.722
But that's okay.

14:48.763 --> 14:50.931
He's too little to do

14:48.763 --> 14:50.931
anything about it.

14:50.973 --> 14:51.932
You're going to have

14:51.974 --> 14:53.560
to eat some dirt-- about

14:51.974 --> 14:53.560
three pounds of it.

14:53.601 --> 14:55.228
What good's a diversion

14:53.601 --> 14:55.228
going to do? We're tied up.

14:55.269 --> 14:57.230
I guess your brothers

14:55.269 --> 14:57.230
never tied you up

14:57.271 --> 14:59.148
and left you in a Dumpster

14:57.271 --> 14:59.148
on trash day.

15:02.151 --> 15:03.361
Okay,

15:02.151 --> 15:03.361
start eating.

15:03.403 --> 15:05.946
It's not fatal,

15:03.403 --> 15:05.946
it only looks like it.

15:05.988 --> 15:06.947
(vomiting)

15:06.989 --> 15:07.948
We need more shovels!

15:07.990 --> 15:10.368
And just get every

15:07.990 --> 15:10.368
bucket you can find!

15:16.249 --> 15:17.958
You might want

15:16.249 --> 15:17.958
to hike up your pants.

15:18.000 --> 15:19.878
He's got another

15:18.000 --> 15:19.878
half hour of this.

15:22.589 --> 15:24.340
Good news, sir.

15:24.382 --> 15:26.217
It looks like Red

15:24.382 --> 15:26.217
Team's about to fold.

15:26.259 --> 15:27.761
Two squads have

15:26.259 --> 15:27.761
been captured,

15:27.802 --> 15:30.764
the others are pinned down

15:27.802 --> 15:30.764
here, here, and here.

15:30.805 --> 15:35.643
Okay, now we've just got to

15:30.805 --> 15:35.643
sneak the keys out of his purse.

15:35.685 --> 15:38.062
(clears throat)

15:43.401 --> 15:44.611
Test, test.

15:46.613 --> 15:47.906
Test, test.

15:49.031 --> 15:49.990
(blows)

15:50.032 --> 15:50.991
The microphone works.

15:51.033 --> 15:51.992
The chair

15:51.033 --> 15:51.992
is perfect,

15:52.034 --> 15:52.993
and your hair

15:52.034 --> 15:52.993
looks fine, sir.

15:53.035 --> 15:54.287
Can we proceed?

15:55.747 --> 15:57.791
Now then, Hal, we've heard

15:55.747 --> 15:57.791
a lot of testimony

15:57.832 --> 16:00.167
from people about what

15:57.832 --> 16:00.167
you've done at this company.

16:00.209 --> 16:02.629
Why don't you tell us

16:00.209 --> 16:02.629
in your own words

16:02.670 --> 16:05.089
what kind of

16:02.670 --> 16:05.089
an employee you were.

16:06.048 --> 16:07.550
Marginal.

16:09.969 --> 16:11.387
At best.

16:11.429 --> 16:12.597
Would you care to elaborate?

16:12.639 --> 16:16.684
When you work for a big,

16:12.639 --> 16:16.684
impersonal corporation

16:16.726 --> 16:17.894
like this...

16:17.936 --> 16:19.437
You know those nature shows

16:19.479 --> 16:22.064
where a wasp paralyzes

16:19.479 --> 16:22.064
a caterpillar,

16:22.106 --> 16:24.024
then injects it full of larvae?

16:24.066 --> 16:25.819
It stays alive for weeks,

16:25.860 --> 16:28.321
completely aware,

16:25.860 --> 16:28.321
feeling every little bite

16:28.362 --> 16:31.031
as the larvae

16:28.362 --> 16:31.031
devour it from the inside.

16:32.074 --> 16:34.034
I sat in a cubicle every day

16:34.076 --> 16:36.036
envying that caterpillar

16:36.078 --> 16:38.957
'cause at least

16:36.078 --> 16:38.957
he got to be on TV.

16:39.958 --> 16:41.751
I hated that job.

16:41.793 --> 16:44.044
I was a crappy employee.

16:44.086 --> 16:45.045
And yet countless

16:45.087 --> 16:47.757
eyewitnesses paint you

16:45.087 --> 16:47.757
as a man at the center

16:47.799 --> 16:49.049
of an ingenious conspiracy.

16:49.091 --> 16:50.677
(soft crying)

16:50.718 --> 16:53.053
Shh-shh...

16:53.095 --> 16:54.931
Time and time again

16:53.095 --> 16:54.931
you were placed

16:54.973 --> 16:56.056
at a crucial event.

16:56.098 --> 16:59.560
Do you have any way

16:56.098 --> 16:59.560
of refuting these claims?

16:59.602 --> 17:00.687
Well, I didn't.

17:00.728 --> 17:01.855
Who could remember

17:01.896 --> 17:04.064
what they were doing

17:01.896 --> 17:04.064
on January 25, 2002

17:04.106 --> 17:06.317
or March 14, 2003?

17:06.359 --> 17:09.069
But my son

17:06.359 --> 17:09.069
figured something out.

17:09.111 --> 17:10.697
Stand up,

17:09.111 --> 17:10.697
Malcolm.

17:11.990 --> 17:13.199
I know he

17:11.990 --> 17:13.199
looks normal,

17:13.240 --> 17:15.075
but my son is a freaky genius

17:13.240 --> 17:15.075
with numbers.

17:15.117 --> 17:16.870
I'm telling you,

17:15.117 --> 17:16.870
his head should be

17:16.911 --> 17:18.078
the size of a medicine ball.

17:18.120 --> 17:19.539
You give him

17:19.580 --> 17:21.081
any day of any year,

17:19.580 --> 17:21.081
and he can tell you

17:21.123 --> 17:22.082
what day

17:21.123 --> 17:22.082
of the week it is.

17:22.124 --> 17:23.710
And what does that have

17:22.124 --> 17:23.710
to do with anything?

17:23.751 --> 17:28.088
Well, he figured out

17:23.751 --> 17:28.088
that every date on the board

17:28.130 --> 17:29.089
is a Friday.

17:29.131 --> 17:31.258
Every one.

17:29.131 --> 17:31.258
You can check the calendar.

17:31.300 --> 17:32.176
DENNIS:

17:31.300 --> 17:32.176
I'm sorry,

17:32.218 --> 17:33.260
I don't understand

17:33.302 --> 17:34.971
why that would be

17:33.302 --> 17:34.971
so important.

17:37.974 --> 17:43.897
I haven't shown up for work

17:37.974 --> 17:43.897
on a Friday in 15 years.

17:43.938 --> 17:47.441
He didn't show up on Fridays

17:43.938 --> 17:47.441
for 15 years!

17:48.943 --> 17:50.987
That isn't going to be

17:48.943 --> 17:50.987
on the record, is it?

17:51.029 --> 17:52.488
Do you have any evidence

17:52.530 --> 17:54.574
to back up this wild assertion?

17:54.615 --> 17:56.743
Well, yeah, once I knew

17:54.615 --> 17:56.743
what to look for,

17:56.784 --> 17:58.494
I realized I had almost

17:56.784 --> 17:58.494
everything I need

17:58.536 --> 18:00.038
right here in my memory box.

18:01.455 --> 18:03.123
The prosecution maintains

18:03.165 --> 18:05.125
that you handed

18:03.165 --> 18:05.125
the board of directors

18:05.167 --> 18:07.294
a set of cooked books

18:05.167 --> 18:07.294
on August 9.

18:07.336 --> 18:11.424
Yes, that's when I went

18:07.336 --> 18:11.424
to Bavaria Land.

18:15.762 --> 18:16.512
And when

18:15.762 --> 18:16.512
you were

18:16.554 --> 18:18.014
supposed to be hiding money

18:18.056 --> 18:19.139
offshore on December 6?

18:19.181 --> 18:20.808
I went to  The Nutcracker.

18:20.850 --> 18:23.728
Pretty good for a community

18:20.850 --> 18:23.728
college production.

18:23.770 --> 18:25.187
DENNIS:

18:23.770 --> 18:25.187
February 21.

18:25.229 --> 18:26.522
My driver's

18:25.229 --> 18:26.522
license

18:26.564 --> 18:28.399
from Grand Prix Go-Carts.

18:29.191 --> 18:31.151
June 27.

18:31.193 --> 18:33.029
Pilgrim Village.

18:33.071 --> 18:34.655
July 11.

18:34.697 --> 18:37.157
There was a ghost

18:34.697 --> 18:37.157
in my car.

18:37.199 --> 18:40.244
Right in my car.

18:41.203 --> 18:43.163
And finally,

18:43.205 --> 18:44.248
August 22.

18:44.290 --> 18:45.332
Well, I was chosen

18:45.374 --> 18:47.710
to be a junior trainer

18:45.374 --> 18:47.710
at Oceanland.

18:50.421 --> 18:53.466
He did all the work.

18:50.421 --> 18:53.466
I just stood there.

18:54.425 --> 18:56.176
(laughing and cheering)

18:56.218 --> 18:58.012
Congratulations,

18:56.218 --> 18:58.012
Hal.

18:59.097 --> 19:01.181
Sorry about my little

18:59.097 --> 19:01.181
outburst there at the end.

19:01.223 --> 19:02.349
But they really

19:01.223 --> 19:02.349
should say

19:02.391 --> 19:04.184
"Innocent" instead

19:02.391 --> 19:04.184
of "Not guilty."

19:04.226 --> 19:05.937
It's confusing.

19:07.897 --> 19:10.524
Lois, we won the case.

19:11.109 --> 19:12.151
Now we can get

19:12.192 --> 19:13.486
our lives back

19:12.192 --> 19:13.486
to the way they were.

19:13.527 --> 19:18.032
You didn't work

19:13.527 --> 19:18.032
on Fridays?

19:18.074 --> 19:19.199
After all

19:18.074 --> 19:19.199
the sacrifices

19:19.241 --> 19:21.869
I made for this family.

19:21.911 --> 19:23.203
For 15 years

19:23.245 --> 19:25.123
I worked double shifts,

19:25.164 --> 19:27.458
drove carpool,

19:25.164 --> 19:27.458
cleaned the house

19:27.500 --> 19:30.128
while you were

19:27.500 --> 19:30.128
feeding Shamu!

19:30.169 --> 19:31.545
Actually, it's Keiko 2.

19:31.587 --> 19:33.506
He's smaller, but you get

19:31.587 --> 19:33.506
just as wet in the front row.

19:33.547 --> 19:34.924
It's a really good show.

19:33.547 --> 19:34.924
Let's...

19:34.966 --> 19:36.134
We should see it

19:34.966 --> 19:36.134
sometime.

19:38.136 --> 19:40.013
All right, let's

19:38.136 --> 19:40.013
get this over with.

19:40.054 --> 19:41.221
Red Team surrenders.

19:41.263 --> 19:42.222
Come on, Hendrix,

19:42.264 --> 19:43.808
you can put a little

19:42.264 --> 19:43.808
feeling into it.

19:43.850 --> 19:44.851
Yes, sir.

19:44.892 --> 19:47.227
That leaves us with

19:44.892 --> 19:47.227
the matter of the wager.

19:47.269 --> 19:48.521
I believe I can

19:47.269 --> 19:48.521
expect to see you

19:48.562 --> 19:50.314
bright and early

19:48.562 --> 19:50.314
tomorrow morning

19:50.356 --> 19:52.025
marching on the

19:50.356 --> 19:52.025
parade grounds

19:52.066 --> 19:54.694
wearing patent leather

19:52.066 --> 19:54.694
pumps and a bustier.

19:54.735 --> 19:55.695
Now, I've always

19:55.736 --> 19:57.446
favored red, but

19:55.736 --> 19:57.446
far be it from me

19:57.488 --> 19:59.239
to tell a lady

19:57.488 --> 19:59.239
how to dress.

19:59.281 --> 20:02.076
(engine rumbling)

20:09.876 --> 20:10.918
Captain,

20:10.960 --> 20:12.252
I suggest you surrender.

20:12.294 --> 20:13.504
If not, I have enough flour

20:13.546 --> 20:14.839
packed in this

20:13.546 --> 20:14.839
barrel to bake

20:14.881 --> 20:16.423
500 cakes.

20:16.465 --> 20:19.259
All right, don't fire.

20:19.301 --> 20:21.303
We hereby surrender.

20:24.306 --> 20:26.100
Ah, what the hell.

20:33.315 --> 20:35.068
Things are finally

20:33.315 --> 20:35.068
back to normal.

20:35.109 --> 20:38.278
Well, except for the fact

20:35.109 --> 20:38.278
that Reese is still missing,

20:38.320 --> 20:40.156
Mom and Dad both

20:38.320 --> 20:40.156
don't have jobs,

20:40.198 --> 20:42.282
and we're

20:40.198 --> 20:42.282
$20,000 in debt.

20:42.324 --> 20:43.951
It's a letter from Reese.

20:45.327 --> 20:47.287
Oh, my God,

20:45.327 --> 20:47.287
he's joined the army.

20:47.329 --> 20:49.373
"Dear family, I'm fine.

20:49.415 --> 20:51.667
"I waited till I was

20:49.415 --> 20:51.667
a success to write to you.

20:51.709 --> 20:53.920
"I finished basic

20:51.709 --> 20:53.920
training at the top

20:53.961 --> 20:54.962
"of my class.

20:55.004 --> 20:56.296
"My drill sergeant told me

20:56.338 --> 20:59.299
I've earned some

20:56.338 --> 20:59.299
sort of reward."

20:59.341 --> 21:00.300
All right, gentlemen.

21:00.342 --> 21:02.220
We've entered

21:00.342 --> 21:02.220
Afghani airspace.

21:02.261 --> 21:03.303
We expect

21:02.261 --> 21:03.303
both hostile

21:03.345 --> 21:04.722
and friendly fire.

21:04.764 --> 21:06.557
The better you remember

21:04.764 --> 21:06.557
your training,

21:06.599 --> 21:08.184
the longer you will survive.

21:08.226 --> 21:09.227
On your feet!

21:09.268 --> 21:11.311
How soon do we land?

21:11.353 --> 21:12.730
Well, that's

21:11.353 --> 21:12.730
up to you.

21:14.065 --> 21:17.068
Remember, pull the green cord

21:14.065 --> 21:17.068
before the light green cord.
