\h\hheld her...

\h\h\h\h\h\hHis mother
wept as she screamed.

14:49.491 --> 14:51.097
And-- and what?

14:51.097 --> 14:53.594
\h\h\hYou think he was
some sort of messiah?

14:55.200 --> 14:57.103
\h\h\h\hHe was
a wife beater.

14:57.103 --> 14:59.006
That poem
\h\hDomestic Abuse.

14:59.006 --> 15:00.337
Is that what
my student called it?

15:01.701 --> 15:03.340
\hHe called it
Backward Rainbow

15:03.340 --> 15:04.671
because that is what this guy
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hlooked like

15:04.671 --> 15:06.310
after his mom died.

15:06.310 --> 15:08.345
\h\h\h\h\hJust as his dad
picked him up to hug him,

15:08.345 --> 15:11.348
\h\h\h\hjust as-- the same dad
who hugged his burning mother,

15:11.348 --> 15:14.549
the same dad whose own skin
\h\h\h\h\hwas blemish-free.

15:16.287 --> 15:17.420
And you saw that?

15:17.420 --> 15:18.652

15:18.652 --> 15:21.424
\h\h\hand there was
not one burn on him.

15:22.623 --> 15:25.593
\h\h\h\hI saw his son
scared to death of him

15:25.593 --> 15:28.431

\h\hwhen they came to court.

15:28.431 --> 15:31.566

15:40.641 --> 15:41.983

18:29.513 --> 18:30.910
\h\h\h\h\h\hit’s not
where you wanna be.

18:32.846 --> 18:34.782
\h\h\h\hAnd if you
do wanna be alone,

18:34.782 --> 18:36.685
\h\h\hthen you better
get used to this room,

18:36.685 --> 18:38.918
\hbecause this is as close to
them as you’re ever gonna get.

18:42.625 --> 18:44.165
Why do you bother?

18:44.792 --> 18:45.925
Why don’t you just...

18:48.433 --> 18:49.599
Leave?

18:54.934 --> 18:56.540
-We made a pact.
\h\h\h\h\h-Pact.

19:00.544 --> 19:01.677
Was it worth it?

19:05.384 --> 19:06.517
\h\h\hI used
to think so.

19:10.422 --> 19:11.951
\h\h\hI’ve never been
the sentimental type.

19:11.951 --> 19:14.492
\h\h\h\h\hYou know,
birthdays, holidays.

19:14.492 --> 19:15.790
\h\h\h\h\hI really
could give a shit.

19:20.564 --> 19:21.862
When I was a kid...

19:23.336 --> 19:25.404
when I met them,
\h\h\h\hI was...

19:26.603 --> 19:27.901
\h\hI was going
through a lot...

19:29.540 --> 19:30.673
with my mom.

19:35.480 --> 19:36.943
\h\h\h\hI ran away
a couple of times.

19:39.847 --> 19:41.288
Anyway, it got bad.

19:41.288 --> 19:45.886
\h\h\hGot to a point where I-- I
didn’t even wanted to be found.

19:49.461 --> 19:50.792
\h\h\h\h\h\h\hBut when
that lot showed up...

19:53.762 --> 19:55.599
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hI realized
you can still be alone...

19:58.701 --> 19:59.834
even when you’re not.

20:01.770 --> 20:02.936
And to me...

20:05.510 --> 20:06.643
at the time...

20:07.644 --> 20:09.943
\h\hin some weird,
screwed-up way...

20:13.650 --> 20:15.553
it felt a lot better
\hthan being alone.

20:23.528 --> 20:24.760
So, you stayed?

20:27.796 --> 20:28.929
I stayed.

20:30.601 --> 20:31.767
So, does it still...

20:33.505 --> 20:34.638
feel better?

20:38.906 --> 20:40.039
\h
You tell me.

20:44.483 --> 20:45.781
\h\h\h\h-
-What happened with your ma?

20:53.855 --> 20:54.988
\h\h\h\h
So, you’re coming?

21:02.468 --> 21:03.964
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hI think
I’m gonna wait it out too.

21:09.970 --> 21:12.038

I didn’t.

30:48.955 --> 30:51.188
Did you take anything?

30:51.188 --> 30:54.587
It seems like the only one
\h\hwho’s doing stuff here

30:54.587 --> 30:56.094

57:05.926 --> 57:09.501
I was just gonna, uh,
\h\hgo to the bathroom.

57:10.997 --> 57:12.471
Me too.

57:12.471 --> 57:13.802
\h\h\h\hI’ve always
wanted a girlfriend.

57:13.802 --> 57:16.574
You’ve never had
\ha girlfriend?

57:16.574 --> 57:19.038
I’ve never
really had friends.

57:29.719 --> 57:32.524
So that’s one hell
of a date you got there.

57:32.524 --> 57:34.086
Hm, yeah.

57:34.086 --> 57:36.187
\h\h\h\h\h\hWait,
what do you mean?

57:36.187 --> 57:39.190
Well, you know, I mean,
\h\h\h\hit’s just not...

57:40.631 --> 57:41.962
It’s not what you
\h\hreally go for.

57:41.962 --> 57:46.769
\h\hWell, I mean,
that’s the point.

58:17.030 --> 58:20.132
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h
So what did you see, loser?

58:20.132 --> 58:22.266
Nothing
I already didn’t know.

58:23.674 --> 58:24.741
\h\h
I don’t even lie.

58:25.742 --> 58:27.271
\h\h
All right. Okay.

58:28.272 --> 58:29.977
There. Done.

58:32.309 --> 58:35.015
-Surprise, surprise.
\h-Yeah.

58:35.884 --> 58:37.787
Ray, it’s hard to start.

59:21.699 --> 59:22.997
Oh, lambchop.

59:22.997 --> 59:26.297
Lambchop.

59:26.297 --> 59:28.299
Is that mine?

59:35.845 --> 59:39.277
\hYou fucking
little freeloader.

59:39.277 --> 59:42.885
\hAll up in my shit,
tripping on my shit.

59:42.885 --> 59:45.250
What fucking good
\hare you anyway?

59:45.250 --> 59:46.790
Hey?

59:50.827 --> 59:54.765
\h\h\h\h\hDid I tell you
why I call you Lambchop?

59:54.765 --> 59:58.131
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h-Yeah, Ma.
-Shut your fucking mouth!

59:58.131 --> 1:00:00.067
\h\h\hDid I say
you could speak?

1:00:00.639 --> 1:00:01.970
Sit down!

1:00:04.137 --> 1:00:08.273
\hI said sit down!
Sit your ass down!

1:00:17.183 --> 1:00:19.691
This is my story.

1:00:19.691 --> 1:00:20.824
My story.

1:00:21.660 --> 1:00:23.057
One night,

1:00:23.057 --> 1:00:26.390
one shitty fucking night,

1:00:26.390 --> 1:00:30.130
while I was walking home
\h\h\h\hfrom university,

1:00:30.130 --> 1:00:32.033
walking down this

1:00:32.033 --> 1:00:35.003
this shitty ass street...

1:00:40.338 --> 1:00:42.681
...when I heard you,

1:00:42.681 --> 1:00:47.180
\h\h\h\ha tiny, tiny
little baby crying.

1:00:47.180 --> 1:00:50.986
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h
No, no, wailing, wailing.

1:00:50.986 --> 1:00:55.221
\h\h\h\h\hI heard you wailing
like a lamb being slaughtered.

1:00:56.090 --> 1:00:58.059
\h\hAnd-- and
what did I do?

1:00:59.225 --> 1:01:00.831
What did I do?

1:01:05.330 --> 1:01:08.333
\h\h\h\hI asked you
a goddamn question!

1:01:09.972 --> 1:01:11.270
What did I do?

1:01:13.745 --> 1:01:15.010
You took me in.

1:01:19.113 --> 1:01:20.785
That’s right.

1:01:20.785 --> 1:01:22.347
I...

1:01:22.347 --> 1:01:25.185
took you in.

1:01:33.292 --> 1:01:36.867
Every inch of your life,

1:01:36.867 --> 1:01:40.200
every ounce of your being

1:01:40.200 --> 1:01:44.941
\h\h\h\h\h\h\his only there
because I allowed it to be.

1:01:58.515 --> 1:02:00.352
Don’t you forget that.

1:02:20.504 --> 1:02:23.782
\h\hI should have left you
where I fucking found you.

1:02:24.948 --> 1:02:27.852
They don’t pay me enough
\h\h\h\h\hfor this shit.

1:02:28.545 --> 1:02:31.790
\h\h\hRaised you
on my own dime.

1:02:31.790 --> 1:02:33.517
No one helped me.

1:02:33.517 --> 1:02:37.059
\h\h\h\hThat’s what you get
for trying to help somebody.

1:02:37.059 --> 1:02:38.423
Fuck off!

1:02:38.423 --> 1:02:39.556
Nothing.

1:02:40.161 --> 1:02:41.965
Nada...

1:02:41.965 --> 1:02:44.033
is what I should have
\h\h\h\h\h\hnamed you.

1:02:44.033 --> 1:02:46.101
\hI tried to name you
after someone great.

1:02:46.101 --> 1:02:48.268
\h\hTried to give you
a chance, that’s all.

1:02:50.875 --> 1:02:53.075
\h\h\h\h\h\hBut nada’s
what you’ll always be.

1:02:55.275 --> 1:02:57.112
I can’t change
\hyour destiny.

1:03:02.546 --> 1:03:04.284
Not yet anyway.

1:03:39.121 --> 1:03:42.520
\h\h-

1:04:06.115 --> 1:04:07.919
\h\h\hYour mom’s
out on the couch again.

1:04:13.958 --> 1:04:15.927
\hShe can’t move
much these days.

1:04:15.927 --> 1:04:19.931
\hCircle of life, huh?
The mother becomes the baby?

1:04:19.931 --> 1:04:22.934
-Soon, you’re wiping her ass.
\h\h\h\h\h\h-I don’t think so.

1:04:23.594 --> 1:04:25.002
Tell my cousin that.

1:04:26.201 --> 1:04:27.499
It happens to all of us.

1:04:28.269 --> 1:04:29.402
No, not me.

1:04:29.402 --> 1:04:31.371
\h\h\h\h\hI-- I think
that’s enough of that.

1:04:32.174 --> 1:04:33.945
So fucking Lincoln.

1:04:33.945 --> 1:04:36.178
\h\h\h\h\h\hAlways thinks
he’s above everyone else.

1:04:38.411 --> 1:04:40.479
-No, that’s not true.
\h\h\h\h\h-No?

1:04:41.084 --> 1:04:42.217
No.

1:04:43.922 --> 1:04:45.616
I just don’t want to be
\h\hlike everyone else.

1:04:45.616 --> 1:04:47.420
\hOh, so you don’t want
special treatment, then?

1:04:49.587 --> 1:04:51.259
Guess you wouldn’t want
\h\h\hthese test answers

1:04:51.259 --> 1:04:52.623
for next week’s final.

1:04:52.623 --> 1:04:55.131
Guess you wouldn’t
\h\h\hwant these.

1:05:04.173 --> 1:05:06.538
\h\h-You know the deal.
-It’s all on the table.

1:05:06.538 --> 1:05:09.178
-It’s all I have.
-It’s not enough.

1:05:11.147 --> 1:05:13.215
I can get you more

1:05:13.215 --> 1:05:15.250
at a party tonight.

1:05:17.989 --> 1:05:20.453
So, you’re coming or what?

1:05:23.060 --> 1:05:25.392
\h\h\hHon, it wouldn’t
be a party without me.

1:05:54.454 --> 1:05:55.653
Are you okay?

1:05:59.426 --> 1:06:01.197
You don’t gotta do
\h\ha taste test.

1:06:01.197 --> 1:06:03.298
\h\h\h\h\h\hYou should not
gonna know the difference

1:06:03.298 --> 1:06:04.629
after half a 12-pack.

1:06:04.629 --> 1:06:08.732
\h\h\hBut unless you wanna
prolong your pain in hers,

1:06:08.732 --> 1:06:11.141
\h\hI would recommend doing
a different type of poison.

1:06:17.444 --> 1:06:20.414
An entire pharmacy
at your fingertips.

1:06:23.186 --> 1:06:26.156
\h\h\h\h\h\h\hWhy plan a murder
when you’ve got a suicide note?

1:06:28.026 --> 1:06:29.357
Apathetic.

1:06:30.424 --> 1:06:32.096
Go with the benzos.

1:06:32.096 --> 1:06:34.626
They’re perfect for a drunk
\h\h\h\h\hwith a death wish.

1:07:40.593 --> 1:07:41.759
I missed you.

1:07:41.759 --> 1:07:43.596
I missed you too.

1:07:55.509 --> 1:07:56.708
It doesn’t matter.

1:07:56.708 --> 1:07:58.677
Yes, it does.

1:08:00.448 --> 1:08:01.713
Why won’t you tell me?

1:08:05.255 --> 1:08:06.553
There’s nothing to tell.

1:08:09.292 --> 1:08:10.656
You’re sick, Corey.

1:08:13.692 --> 1:08:14.891
Do I look sick?

1:08:34.416 --> 1:08:35.780
\h\h\h\h\h\h\hOh!

1:08:37.254 --> 1:08:39.355
\h\h\h\h\hTrying to keep
all the fun to yourself.

1:08:39.355 --> 1:08:40.521
Are you?

1:08:48.298 --> 1:08:49.497
Two tickets...

1:08:51.565 --> 1:08:53.171
to Wonderland, my lady.

1:08:55.899 --> 1:08:57.406
Whoa! Wait up.

1:09:02.180 --> 1:09:03.313
So, where’s the snow at?

1:09:04.710 --> 1:09:05.942
You’ve got it.

1:09:05.942 --> 1:09:09.484
Nah, this is that heavy shit
\h\hwe did at Linc’s place.

1:09:09.484 --> 1:09:12.355
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hI want them
Winter Wonder Dreams, baby.

1:09:13.455 --> 1:09:14.687
Oh, baby.

1:09:14.687 --> 1:09:17.855
\h\h\h\h\hYou and the clink
over there may rule your...

1:09:17.855 --> 1:09:19.923
\hwhatever shithole
you guys are from.

1:09:19.923 --> 1:09:22.530
When you’re in my house,

1:09:22.530 --> 1:09:23.696
know when to shut up.

1:09:24.829 --> 1:09:26.435
\h\h\h
This is the one?

1:09:28.800 --> 1:09:30.769
Yeah,
\h\h\hwould that be?

1:09:30.769 --> 1:09:32.672
\hYou really
don’t know, do you?

1:09:32.672 --> 1:09:34.476
You’re really that cliché?

1:09:34.476 --> 1:09:37.743
You daddy’s boys
\h\hare all the fucking same.

1:09:37.743 --> 1:09:40.515
\h\h\h\h\hFancy and empty,
just like this sweet pad.

1:09:43.320 --> 1:09:44.717
Isn’t this supposed to be
\h\h\h\ha birthday party?

1:09:44.717 --> 1:09:48.490
Pretty sweet birthday party.
\h\h\hNo family, no friends.

1:09:48.490 --> 1:09:50.492
He has friends. He has us.

1:09:50.492 --> 1:09:51.724
Does he really?

1:09:53.627 --> 1:09:54.892
Are you really?

1:10:02.306 --> 1:10:03.736
So, prove it.

1:10:06.002 --> 1:10:09.247
\h\h-A game of True Blue.
-No, I don’t do that shit.

1:10:09.247 --> 1:10:12.613
You was about to do that shit
with your missus just before.

1:10:12.613 --> 1:10:14.516
\h\h\h\h
That was different.

1:10:14.516 --> 1:10:18.256
\h\h\h\h\h\hWhy? Because your
shithole is shinier than ours?

1:10:18.256 --> 1:10:19.554
\h\h\h\h\h\hYou think
you’re better than us?

1:10:19.554 --> 1:10:21.457
He didn’t say that.

1:10:21.457 --> 1:10:24.262
Nah, but he meant it, though.
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hHe meant it.

1:10:24.262 --> 1:10:26.594
\h\h\h\hThere’s always
exceptions to you lot.

1:10:26.594 --> 1:10:27.859
Rules to suit you.

1:10:27.859 --> 1:10:28.992
\h\h\h\h\h
And so, what if we do?

1:10:29.762 --> 1:10:31.269
What’s it to you, huh?

1:10:31.269 --> 1:10:33.271
\h\h\h\hDo I tell you
how to live your life?

1:10:33.271 --> 1:10:35.438
Do I get in your face
and remind you of all

1:10:35.438 --> 1:10:38.034
the shit that you were born
\h\h\hwith and wanna forget?

1:10:38.034 --> 1:10:39.442
\h\h\h\h\h
I think I remember you

1:10:39.442 --> 1:10:40.641
doing exactly that.

1:10:49.881 --> 1:10:51.322
Give me the snow.

1:11:01.057 --> 1:11:02.696
\h\h\h\h-It’s yours.

1:11:03.631 --> 1:11:04.764
Ladies first.

1:11:12.871 --> 1:11:14.411
One for me.

1:11:28.656 --> 1:11:29.789
Any day?

1:11:29.789 --> 1:11:31.758
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hSorry,
I didn’t see you there.

1:11:34.596 --> 1:11:35.927
Sweet dreams.

1:11:45.706 --> 1:11:47.576
Shoot. Candles.

1:11:49.105 --> 1:11:51.008
\h\h\h\hCan’t have
a birthday without a wish?

1:11:53.483 --> 1:11:54.880
I recommend the milk.

1:11:55.683 --> 1:11:57.047
Takes care of the booze.

1:11:57.817 --> 1:11:59.115
Then, no, thanks.

1:12:18.673 --> 1:12:20.136
I must have left one in.

1:12:21.742 --> 1:12:22.875
Must have.

1:12:31.917 --> 1:12:34.117
-I’m not wearing pants?
\h\h\h\h\h\h-Oh, sorry.

1:12:44.963 --> 1:12:46.899
\h\hThis night has brought
a lot of things to light,

1:12:46.899 --> 1:12:48.065
don’t you think?

1:12:50.441 --> 1:12:51.640
Sorry.

1:12:54.742 --> 1:12:55.941
Um...

1:12:55.941 --> 1:12:58.647
you-- you-- you see
things differently.

1:12:59.945 --> 1:13:01.111
I can tell.

1:13:02.948 --> 1:13:04.917
\h\hYou see things
that others don’t.

1:13:08.822 --> 1:13:10.725
\h\h\hYou get like that
when you grow up alone.

1:13:10.725 --> 1:13:12.727
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hYou have
a lot of time to watch.

1:13:13.794 --> 1:13:14.927
Watch what?

1:13:15.895 --> 1:13:17.061
Others live.

1:13:22.704 --> 1:13:25.036
\h\h\h\h\h\hHad any joy
they feel, that freedom.

1:13:25.036 --> 1:13:27.775
\hThat freedom
of being carefree.

1:13:32.142 --> 1:13:33.550
I used to envy them.

1:13:34.683 --> 1:13:35.816
I wanna be them.

1:13:37.455 --> 1:13:38.654
Pretend to be them.

1:13:40.755 --> 1:13:42.823
\h\hBut I knew deep down
to be really like them,

1:13:42.823 --> 1:13:44.528
that would come
\hwith a price.

1:13:51.766 --> 1:13:53.702
\h\h\hWho would have thought
you and I would be so alike?

1:13:54.197 --> 1:13:55.605
Right?

1:13:56.837 --> 1:13:57.937
Clare?

1:14:04.009 --> 1:14:06.484
\h\h\h\hYou and I
are nothing alike.

1:14:09.685 --> 1:14:16.593
♪

1:14:27.835 --> 1:14:28.968
Sweet dreams.

1:14:33.269 --> 1:14:34.743
Core?

1:16:16.878 --> 1:16:19.045
\h\h
Big boys don’t cry.

1:16:19.045 --> 1:16:21.212
\h\hDon’t cry.
Don’t cry. Don’t cry...

1:16:30.254 --> 1:16:31.761
Where’s the cake?

1:16:37.063 --> 1:16:39.230
You can’t have a birthday
\h\h\h\h\hwithout a wish.

1:16:41.199 --> 1:16:43.201
\h\h\h\h\h\hNot that
there’s much point.

1:16:43.201 --> 1:16:45.940
\h\h\h\hWe all know
what you’d wish for.

1:16:47.942 --> 1:16:49.141
\h\h
And what’s that?

1:16:49.141 --> 1:16:50.780
To be like me.

1:16:53.409 --> 1:16:56.280
