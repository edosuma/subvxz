00:23.624 --> 00:25.393
<i>Previously on</i> Ghost...

00:25.426 --> 00:26.727
So you really did
kill your father?

00:26.761 --> 00:28.696
<i>He might not be here
no more, but...</i>

00:28.729 --> 00:30.264
Ghosts never die.

00:30.297 --> 00:31.799
I need a legitimate paycheck.

00:32.032 --> 00:33.267
I'll have my lawyers
draw up the papers.

00:33.300 --> 00:34.402
<i>All you'll need
is someone to sign on</i>

00:34.435 --> 00:35.436
<i>as president
of the corporation</i>

00:35.469 --> 00:37.271
- <i>and a 30
- K down payment.</i>

00:37.304 --> 00:39.073
<i>The Sweeney thing.</i>

00:39.106 --> 00:41.208
<i>I was really kinda hoping
you'd given up on that dream.</i>

00:41.242 --> 00:42.576
<i>You hoped wrong.</i>

00:46.781 --> 00:48.149
Nice work.

00:48.182 --> 00:49.583
With him out the way,
I'm counting on you.

00:49.617 --> 00:50.618
I got you.

00:50.651 --> 00:51.819
First order of business,
whip out

00:52.052 --> 00:53.320
that little cell phone
and call your pops.

00:53.354 --> 00:55.055
We gotta tell him
that we don't have any product

00:55.089 --> 00:57.057
on account of us
getting robbed and all.

00:57.091 --> 00:58.292
Get my fucking weight back.

00:58.325 --> 00:59.593
I'll try, Papi,
but it's probably

00:59.627 --> 01:00.628
already up at Stansfield.

01:00.661 --> 01:03.664
Dru, get my fucking drugs.

01:03.697 --> 01:05.566
<i>Maybe I can help.</i>

01:08.402 --> 01:10.504
<i>Where is my fucking bag?</i>

01:10.538 --> 01:11.539
What the fuck
you talking about?

01:11.572 --> 01:12.673
I know you stole
my drugs, Cane,

01:12.706 --> 01:13.707
but I let that shit slide.

01:13.741 --> 01:14.842
Not this bag, though.

01:19.547 --> 01:21.549
<i>You ratted on some of
the biggest heads in the game.</i>

01:21.582 --> 01:23.417
You're, like, the GOAT
of global snitching.

01:24.852 --> 01:26.253
What do you want?

01:26.287 --> 01:27.321
I want two million.

01:27.354 --> 01:28.522
<i>I need hard evidence</i>

01:28.556 --> 01:30.324
against Tariq St. Patrick,
and I need it now.

01:30.357 --> 01:31.525
<i>Brayden, you're the one
on the tape.</i>

01:31.559 --> 01:33.360
<i>You're implicated
by this evidence,</i>

01:33.394 --> 01:35.129
and I think you could give me
Tariq St. Patrick on a platter.

01:35.162 --> 01:37.264
You can testify,
or I can indict you.

01:37.298 --> 01:39.300
What if Trace testifies?

01:39.333 --> 01:41.669
Tariq's chick wore a wire.
She got us both on tape.

01:41.702 --> 01:43.471
<i>She talks, we both go down.</i>

01:43.504 --> 01:44.605
Get the fuck in the car!

01:44.638 --> 01:46.640
You do not wanna do this.

01:46.674 --> 01:49.276
<i>Lorenzo came after us.
He came after Zeke.</i>

01:49.310 --> 01:51.712
<i>He won't rest until he takes
everything away from me.</i>

01:51.745 --> 01:53.147
We need to kill his ass.

03:54.501 --> 03:56.670
Thank you.

03:56.704 --> 03:59.406
So you thought this
all the way through, didn't you?

03:59.440 --> 04:01.675
A goal without a plan
is just a wish, right?

04:01.709 --> 04:03.777
Yeah, I've been planning this
ever since I lost you.

04:03.811 --> 04:06.547
You turned yourself into Mecca,
and you lied to me.

04:06.580 --> 04:08.582
No, I turned myself into Mecca

04:08.616 --> 04:11.785
to do whatever it took
to find my way back to you.

04:11.819 --> 04:13.520
The last thing I ever wanted
was for the game

04:13.554 --> 04:15.589
to get between us again,
Nae-Nae.

04:16.523 --> 04:18.926
And that's why we gotta be real
careful getting rid of Lorenzo.

04:18.959 --> 04:20.594
What?

04:20.628 --> 04:23.030
You was down last night.
Why you backing out now?

04:23.263 --> 04:25.499
I'm just saying
we need to be careful.

04:25.532 --> 04:27.434
Look, Lorenzo goes missing,
turns up dead,

04:27.468 --> 04:29.436
what's our cover, hmm?

04:29.470 --> 04:31.772
If Cane does it,
we can establish our alibi

04:31.805 --> 04:33.040
at my penthouse.

04:33.273 --> 04:34.475
It's perfect.

04:34.508 --> 04:35.943
No one will ever suspect
either one of us

04:35.976 --> 04:37.978
had anything to do
with that shit.

04:39.279 --> 04:42.016
Unless, of course,
Cane ain't 100

04:42.049 --> 04:43.550
and we have a bigger problem.

04:43.584 --> 04:44.952
Cane does whatever I say.

04:44.985 --> 04:46.887
Hmm.
Like when he stole your coke?

04:46.920 --> 04:49.356
Tricked you
into working with me?

04:53.827 --> 04:54.828
You're right.

04:56.830 --> 04:59.333
Cane should kill Lorenzo.

04:59.366 --> 05:00.901
I'll tell him myself.

05:03.370 --> 05:04.972
Okay.

05:05.005 --> 05:06.874
I'm gonna go tell
the captain we're ready.

05:06.907 --> 05:08.542
All right.

05:22.356 --> 05:23.957
<i>You've reached Lauren Baldwin.</i>

05:23.991 --> 05:25.559
<i>Please leave a message.</i>

05:25.592 --> 05:29.063
Shit, fuck. Where are you?

05:30.597 --> 05:31.899
Who are you calling?

05:35.102 --> 05:36.503
Boy, if it's another girl
on that phone,

05:36.537 --> 05:37.638
you ain't gotta do
all that, okay?

05:37.671 --> 05:38.906
Just leave a message.

05:38.939 --> 05:40.107
You buggin'.

05:43.510 --> 05:44.712
I gotta go early.

05:44.745 --> 05:47.047
I'm meeting Davis before court.
And I was just...

05:49.116 --> 05:52.386
...I was just calling to see
if Lauren got out of town safe.

05:53.587 --> 05:57.858
I-I'm sure she did.
You don't have to worry.

05:57.891 --> 05:59.593
I mean, she's not
answering no calls,

05:59.626 --> 06:00.994
no texts, nothing.

06:01.028 --> 06:03.731
She probably ditched her phone.

06:03.764 --> 06:06.467
Yeah, but I still
gotta worry, though.

06:06.500 --> 06:09.636
Tate held it down, yes,
but I never know

06:09.670 --> 06:11.605
what the fuck is coming
for me next.

06:13.774 --> 06:16.810
Well, whatever it is, I'm here
every step of the way, okay?

06:20.547 --> 06:22.516
I gotta ask you something.

06:24.785 --> 06:28.422
My sister's adoption
is about to be final,

06:28.455 --> 06:30.824
and my dad made it
so once it is,

06:30.858 --> 06:34.428
her records are sealed, and...

06:34.461 --> 06:36.864
I'll never be able
to see her again.

06:39.900 --> 06:42.903
Effie, if I go inside,
would you...

06:42.936 --> 06:44.638
would you find her for me?

06:46.473 --> 06:48.776
Uh, you-you would
trust me to do that?

06:50.577 --> 06:51.879
Other than my mom,
you the only person

06:51.912 --> 06:53.914
I can trust at all.

06:58.652 --> 06:59.853
Tate bought us some time,

06:59.887 --> 07:01.789
but he may have done
more harm than good.

07:01.822 --> 07:03.657
Jenny checked out
the witness Tate mentioned

07:03.690 --> 07:05.159
on the stand--bogus.

07:05.192 --> 07:07.060
So she found one that wasn't.

07:07.094 --> 07:09.463
Trace Weston.

07:09.496 --> 07:10.531
The fuck?

07:10.564 --> 07:12.766
Yeah.

07:12.800 --> 07:14.701
Any idea what Trace knows?

07:17.171 --> 07:19.039
Cane.

07:19.072 --> 07:20.974
All right, Cane gave--

07:21.008 --> 07:23.043
gave Brayden
some pills to sell.

07:23.076 --> 07:24.545
Trace stole them,
and when Cane found out,

07:24.578 --> 07:26.880
he took them both
to the hood to scare them.

07:26.914 --> 07:28.749
Ramirez gave them a ride
back to Stansfield.

07:28.782 --> 07:30.684
Where were you
when this happened?

07:30.717 --> 07:32.152
You know, you should know, Saxe.

07:32.186 --> 07:34.521
I was actually in my dorm
with snitchin'-ass Riley.

07:34.555 --> 07:36.990
Um, that's great news.
We can put her on the stand.

07:37.024 --> 07:38.592
No, no.

07:38.625 --> 07:41.495
Riley's mom, my sister,
still doesn't talk to me.

07:41.528 --> 07:43.063
I can't-I can't
rope her into this.

07:43.096 --> 07:44.798
You're absolutely right.

07:44.832 --> 07:46.934
And you should have thought
of this moment

07:46.967 --> 07:48.635
before you put her in play.

07:48.669 --> 07:50.470
Look, if I have to burn you
and Riley

07:50.504 --> 07:52.840
to defend my client,

07:52.873 --> 07:54.174
so be it.

08:00.981 --> 08:05.252
Look, um, once Trace names Cane
in open court,

08:05.485 --> 08:07.788
Cane'll think you put Trace
up to it.

08:07.821 --> 08:09.189
We both know why.

08:09.223 --> 08:11.525
Yes, to get him back for
putting the badge in my room.

08:11.558 --> 08:12.960
Yeah.

08:12.993 --> 08:14.962
How long have you known?

08:16.196 --> 08:17.531
He'll be looking for you.

08:17.564 --> 08:19.566
Look, let me go talk to Saxe.

08:30.677 --> 08:32.512
<i>Yo, yo, yo, this is Brayden.</i>

08:32.546 --> 08:34.915
<i>If this is about a party
or a date, hang up--</i>

08:39.987 --> 08:41.188
So what you think?

08:43.290 --> 08:46.126
Ah, these cars is dope as hell.

08:46.159 --> 08:49.129
Aw, shit you got a jet, too?

08:49.162 --> 08:50.797
Mm-hmm.

08:50.831 --> 08:52.866
Speaking of which,
have you decided

08:52.900 --> 08:54.001
if you're coming with us?

08:55.269 --> 08:57.938
I mean, Zeke,
what's left for you here, hmm?

08:57.971 --> 09:00.540
You dropped out of Stansfield.
The Kings are reconsidering.

09:00.574 --> 09:02.576
Yeah, but here
I know where I stand.

09:02.609 --> 09:03.944
With Monet, I never do.

09:05.579 --> 09:07.314
And, honestly, if you trust her,

09:07.547 --> 09:08.916
I'm not sure
if I can trust you.

09:08.949 --> 09:10.884
Whoa, hold on.
I never lied to you.

09:10.918 --> 09:13.620
When Monet said she was
with you the night Carrie died,

09:13.654 --> 09:14.788
was that the truth?

09:14.821 --> 09:17.224
Zeke, what looks like
lies and betrayal,

09:17.257 --> 09:20.894
I'm telling you, it's nothing
but unconditional love.

09:20.928 --> 09:23.163
Now, maybe you'll understand that
when you have kids of your own,

09:23.196 --> 09:25.265
but Monet would do anything for you.

09:27.034 --> 09:28.568
You can trust me on that.

09:30.704 --> 09:32.606
You see this one right here?

09:34.775 --> 09:36.176
She's yours.

09:37.311 --> 09:38.312
For real?

09:38.345 --> 09:41.615
Yes. All yours.

09:43.083 --> 09:44.351
Thanks.

09:44.584 --> 09:46.119
There's an open seat
on that plane

09:46.153 --> 09:48.221
when we dip out
the night after tomorrow.

09:48.255 --> 09:50.624
Only you choose
if you're on it.

09:56.630 --> 09:57.731
You was fine last night.

09:57.764 --> 09:58.966
What's the problem?

09:58.999 --> 10:01.635
I said that shit because
that's what you told Mecca

10:01.668 --> 10:03.036
or Dante or whatever
you wanna call him.

10:03.070 --> 10:05.072
I lied.

10:05.105 --> 10:07.207
We both know Lorenzo
didn't rob him.

10:07.240 --> 10:09.343
Look, I lied to save yo' ass.

10:09.376 --> 10:11.011
Still don't change
our plans with Mecca.

10:11.044 --> 10:12.312
It don't, huh?

10:12.346 --> 10:13.947
That's because he want me
to do it, right?

10:13.981 --> 10:15.082
He does.

10:17.684 --> 10:19.186
You ask me to do
some crazy shit, Ma,

10:19.219 --> 10:20.854
and I've done everything
you ever asked me to do,

10:20.887 --> 10:22.889
but I can't believe you want me
to kill my own fucking father.

10:22.923 --> 10:24.324
Why?

10:24.358 --> 10:26.193
I'm the one scheming
and scraping

10:26.226 --> 10:28.228
to keep your ass out of jail,
not him.

10:29.863 --> 10:32.299
What does 'Renzo mean to you
at this point, Cane?

10:32.332 --> 10:34.768
You ain't running the business.

10:34.801 --> 10:36.103
He gave it to Dru.

10:37.371 --> 10:39.172
And when he shut us down,
we had to go behind his back

10:39.206 --> 10:41.141
to feed ourselves.

10:41.174 --> 10:42.709
And don't forget how he got
the prison guards

10:42.743 --> 10:45.779
to beat you down
when you got out of line.

10:45.812 --> 10:47.347
He rockin' that Jesus piece
you got him,

10:47.381 --> 10:49.182
but he don't even respect you.

10:49.216 --> 10:50.417
What kinda shit is that?

10:50.650 --> 10:51.885
That's my fucking father.

10:51.918 --> 10:53.153
I got his name.

10:53.186 --> 10:55.155
More of a reason
for you to be next in line.

10:56.923 --> 10:58.959
Yo, if this was
any other nigga in the street

10:58.992 --> 11:00.193
disrespecting you
like this, Cane,

11:00.227 --> 11:02.095
you would've been put
his ass in the ground.

11:05.098 --> 11:07.734
Your father shot at me.

11:07.768 --> 11:09.236
You gonna stand for that?

11:11.204 --> 11:14.174
It's him or me, Cane. Choose.

11:16.977 --> 11:19.146
I do this shit,

11:19.179 --> 11:20.747
Dru and Diana
will never forgive me.

11:20.781 --> 11:22.082
You know that, right?

11:22.115 --> 11:23.683
I'll deal with Dru and Diana.

11:27.220 --> 11:30.323
Here. It's clean.

11:37.397 --> 11:39.766
Where the fuck is Tariq?

11:39.800 --> 11:41.068
Where is this nigga
when I need him?

11:41.101 --> 11:43.003
I don't need Tariq for shit.

11:43.036 --> 11:44.438
And that motherfucker
not touching Pops.

11:44.471 --> 11:47.040
Maybe not, but maybe
he can help you

11:47.074 --> 11:48.442
wrap your mind around it.

11:49.976 --> 11:51.845
Look, this nigga killed
his own father.

11:53.313 --> 11:55.415
Wait, you telling me this
pussy-ass nigga offed his pops?

11:55.449 --> 11:56.783
Yeah.

12:01.254 --> 12:02.956
Fuck it. I'll do it.

12:12.766 --> 12:13.934
I told Mecca
he could trust you.

12:18.438 --> 12:21.041
In summation, the Brady
violation that Mr. MacLean

12:21.074 --> 12:23.110
was so worried about
didn't occur, Your Honor.

12:23.143 --> 12:24.344
<i>Glad to hear it.</i>

12:24.377 --> 12:26.947
I see you've submitted
a revised witness list

12:26.980 --> 12:30.016
with a Robert "Trace" Weston III added.

12:30.050 --> 12:31.051
I have.

12:31.084 --> 12:33.520
Unfortunately, I was told
this morning that Trace is ill.

12:33.753 --> 12:36.490
Since his testimony is crucial
and to not delay us further,

12:36.523 --> 12:38.125
I'd like to call
another witness

12:38.158 --> 12:40.093
that can testify
to the same set of facts.

12:40.127 --> 12:42.262
The defense wouldn't need
additional preparation.

12:42.295 --> 12:44.297
Um, Your Honor, the prosecution

12:44.331 --> 12:48.034
can't just sub in witnesses
like an NBA roster.

12:48.068 --> 12:49.803
We've delayed long enough
as it is.

12:49.836 --> 12:52.539
<i>I'll allow it with a stern warning,
Ms. Sullivan.</i>

12:52.772 --> 12:54.107
This is your last chance.

12:54.141 --> 12:55.542
Thank you, Your Honor.

12:55.775 --> 12:58.078
I'd like to call
Brayden Weston to the stand.

12:59.346 --> 13:00.447
What?

13:18.999 --> 13:20.834
What about
Professor Reynolds?

13:20.867 --> 13:23.103
Professor Reynolds
wasn't supposed to die.

13:23.136 --> 13:24.804
He just started doing too much.

13:24.838 --> 13:26.072
Once the kid died in the pool,

13:26.106 --> 13:27.908
he wanted to help the cops
with their investigation,

13:27.941 --> 13:29.910
and he wanted to write
a book about my life.

13:29.943 --> 13:32.212
<i>Do you solemnly swear
to tell the truth,</i>

13:32.245 --> 13:33.547
the whole truth,
and nothing but the truth,

13:33.580 --> 13:34.981
so help you God?

13:35.015 --> 13:36.516
I do.

13:38.418 --> 13:42.122
Mr. Weston, are you familiar
with the defendant?

13:42.155 --> 13:45.492
Tariq? Yeah, we're friends.

13:45.525 --> 13:47.494
We met at Choate.
We were roommates--

13:47.527 --> 13:49.496
But Tariq wasn't
at Choate for long.

13:49.529 --> 13:51.998
Do you recall
why he transferred?

13:52.032 --> 13:54.868
Yeah, somebody
was selling drugs on campus.

13:54.901 --> 13:56.503
The dean found a stash
in our room,

13:56.536 --> 13:58.138
<i>assumed it was Tariq's.</i>

13:58.171 --> 14:00.840
A student
selling drugs at school.

14:00.874 --> 14:03.076
Just like in
Professor Reynolds' novel.

14:03.109 --> 14:05.245
And at Stansfield, you're also
roommates with Tariq

14:05.278 --> 14:08.281
even though it appears he was
assigned to Ezekiel Cross?

14:08.315 --> 14:10.317
I asked Tariq to switch.

14:10.350 --> 14:13.520
We had extra room
in my father's old dorm, so...

14:20.527 --> 14:24.164
Which is why I know
Tariq didn't kill

14:24.197 --> 14:26.032
Professor Reynolds
and Officer Ramirez.

14:27.434 --> 14:29.369
Your Honor.

14:29.402 --> 14:31.004
Mr. Weston, keep your answers

14:31.037 --> 14:32.906
within the scope
of the questions

14:32.939 --> 14:34.474
Ms. Sullivan asks you.

14:34.507 --> 14:36.042
I apologize, Your Honor,

14:36.076 --> 14:40.280
but I just want her to know
that I was the one

14:40.313 --> 14:43.049
that was dealing drugs
at Choate and Stansfield,

14:43.083 --> 14:44.351
<i>not Tariq.</i>

14:44.384 --> 14:46.152
- Objection.
- You object?

14:46.186 --> 14:47.887
Your Honor,
this is her witness.

14:47.921 --> 14:50.023
Mr. Weston, one more misstep,

14:50.056 --> 14:53.260
and you and I have a problem,
do you understand?

14:53.293 --> 14:54.928
I understand.

14:54.961 --> 14:57.264
Permission to treat the witness
as hostile, Your Honor.

14:57.297 --> 14:58.431
Permission granted.

14:58.465 --> 15:00.166
<i>Mr. Weston,
you say you're the one</i>

15:00.200 --> 15:02.035
selling drugs at Stansfield.

15:02.068 --> 15:03.436
Your proof?

15:03.470 --> 15:05.605
My proof is CourseCorrect.

15:05.639 --> 15:07.507
It's an app that I built.

15:07.540 --> 15:11.111
Designed for tutoring, but it's
actually a front for drugs.

15:11.144 --> 15:14.014
But how do we know that
you're the one behind the app?

15:14.047 --> 15:15.115
I mean, you just admitted

15:15.148 --> 15:16.616
you're friends
with the defendant.

15:16.650 --> 15:19.286
You could be covering for him.

15:19.319 --> 15:22.522
Here is paperwork
from Stern Enterprises

15:22.555 --> 15:26.626
that shows that I am
the president of CourseCorrect.

15:31.131 --> 15:33.633
- May I approach, Your Honor?
- Um, us too, Your Honor?

15:33.667 --> 15:35.535
Yes, all of you.

15:41.541 --> 15:43.410
That's about right.
Here you go, Judge.

15:43.443 --> 15:44.978
Right there.

15:45.011 --> 15:48.615
This is yet another piece
of exculpatory evidence

15:48.648 --> 15:52.385
that Ms. Sullivan failed
to bring forward or find.

15:52.419 --> 15:55.989
She-she built her entire case
on a motive

15:56.022 --> 15:59.592
which Mr. Weston just skewered
with concrete evidence.

15:59.626 --> 16:03.630
He's the campus drug dealer
in the victim's novel.

16:03.663 --> 16:05.031
I move to dismiss.

16:05.065 --> 16:07.367
I don't have to prove motive,
Your Honor.

16:07.400 --> 16:08.468
That is true, but do you think

16:08.501 --> 16:10.370
you have any chance
of a conviction

16:10.403 --> 16:11.404
with this jury?

16:24.417 --> 16:27.020
Could you move to dismiss
without prejudice, Your Honor?

16:27.053 --> 16:28.655
Allow the district attorney
the opportunity

16:28.688 --> 16:30.690
to re-present
with new evidence.

16:30.724 --> 16:32.192
Jeopardy's attached,
Your Honor.

16:32.225 --> 16:34.494
He's right, Ms. Sullivan.

16:34.527 --> 16:36.563
Based on this recent
turn of events,

16:36.596 --> 16:39.232
I would like to thank the jury
for their service.

16:39.265 --> 16:40.467
This case is dismissed.

16:40.500 --> 16:42.669
What? It's over?

16:42.702 --> 16:45.305
Mr. St. Patrick,
you are free to go.

16:50.110 --> 16:51.778
I told you, boy.

17:00.620 --> 17:02.622
I can't believe you did that.

17:06.159 --> 17:07.761
My client has no comment.

17:10.797 --> 17:12.599
Yup.

17:12.632 --> 17:15.402
We did it, kid.
You are free to go.

17:38.391 --> 17:40.260
Tough break. I was thinking--

17:40.293 --> 17:41.494
Nope.

17:47.300 --> 17:49.502
To our prison-free
future together.

17:51.070 --> 17:53.440
You know, now that
my charges are dropped,

17:53.473 --> 17:55.809
I need to stop
my sister's adoption.

17:55.842 --> 17:59.078
I'ma try to get custody.
Once I do, that means I'm out.

17:59.112 --> 18:02.449
Tariq, uh, since the day
we met, you've been hustling.

18:02.482 --> 18:07.387
I mean, first Natasha,
then your sister.

18:07.420 --> 18:11.658
But today you get
a fresh start, my friend,

18:11.691 --> 18:15.728
and in a few years,
flush with cash,

18:15.762 --> 18:17.630
you're done with Stansfield.

18:17.664 --> 18:19.766
Focus on your sister then.

18:19.799 --> 18:22.135
Nah, I ain't doing that.

18:22.168 --> 18:24.137
All right, that's some shit
that my father would do.

18:24.170 --> 18:25.472
I ain't built like that nigga.

18:25.505 --> 18:27.740
And since I can't speak
to my mother,

18:27.774 --> 18:29.542
I need to think about
what she would want me to do,

18:29.576 --> 18:32.345
and I think she would want me
to take care of Yasmine.

18:32.378 --> 18:34.681
For real.
Your charges were just dropped.

18:34.714 --> 18:36.416
I know Jenny Sullivan's
not gonna

18:36.449 --> 18:38.151
let the Cane Tejada
evidence go,

18:38.184 --> 18:40.653
and if it backs up on Cane,

18:40.687 --> 18:42.355
it backs up on us.

18:42.388 --> 18:45.391
I ain't gonna lie, that shit
backs up on you, okay?

18:45.425 --> 18:47.260
And to be honest,
you owe me a refund,

18:47.293 --> 18:48.328
'cause Brayden's the one

18:48.361 --> 18:49.562
that got my charges dropped,
not you.

18:49.596 --> 18:51.464
Excuse me. A-a refund?

18:51.498 --> 18:52.632
Yes.

18:52.665 --> 18:54.400
You done lost
your rabid-ass mind, son.

18:54.434 --> 18:56.903
You know it's against the rules
for attorneys to double-dip.

18:57.136 --> 18:58.538
You got paid for Cane too.

19:01.307 --> 19:02.475
My nigga.

19:02.509 --> 19:04.244
You know who dropped
that badge in my room,

19:04.277 --> 19:05.645
and you ain't say shit.

19:05.678 --> 19:07.647
Only one reason not to.

19:07.680 --> 19:10.316
I was protecting you.

19:10.350 --> 19:12.752
Hey, I still am.

19:12.785 --> 19:15.188
I should let you go
to the, uh, bar committee

19:15.221 --> 19:19.592
and file your little complaint
about my conflict of interest.

19:20.827 --> 19:23.396
Ooh, but then you'd have
to admit you and Cane

19:23.429 --> 19:25.698
were both guilty
in order to make it stick.

19:27.834 --> 19:30.370
We both know you ain't
gon' do that, killer.

19:30.403 --> 19:33.540
So I'ma keep my money...

19:33.573 --> 19:35.475
and you gonna hustle.

19:35.508 --> 19:36.943
The Tejadas ain't gonna just

19:37.176 --> 19:38.878
let you walk away, son.

19:41.848 --> 19:43.449
Yeah, whatever. I gotta dip.

19:43.483 --> 19:44.851
Make sure Warren
stops this adoption.

19:44.884 --> 19:47.587
Once I get my sister back,
we done, a'ight?

19:47.620 --> 19:48.955
You know what, kid?

19:50.924 --> 19:52.959
You might make
a decent lawyer someday.

19:54.527 --> 19:55.762
Nigga, you know there's
no such thing

19:55.795 --> 19:57.497
as a decent lawyer.

20:13.279 --> 20:14.847
- <i>What's up?</i>
- Cane.

20:14.881 --> 20:18.384
My brother, great news.

20:26.459 --> 20:27.794
Cooper.

20:28.761 --> 20:30.430
Jenny. Hey.

20:30.463 --> 20:32.465
Uh, how'd you find me?

20:32.498 --> 20:35.735
I, uh--you used to come here
after every win

20:35.768 --> 20:36.970
when you were on our side.

20:38.471 --> 20:39.872
Ah.

20:39.906 --> 20:41.441
Lauren Baldwin is dead.

20:43.943 --> 20:45.278
It's all my fault.

20:45.311 --> 20:47.614
No, no, Jenny.

20:47.647 --> 20:48.915
Come here.

20:48.948 --> 20:50.650
You?

20:54.454 --> 20:56.356
I, um...

20:56.389 --> 20:58.324
I removed
Lauren's protective custody

20:58.358 --> 21:00.426
when Carrie Milgram
took her place.

21:00.460 --> 21:02.729
Well, you did it
by the book.

21:02.762 --> 21:04.597
How could you have known?

21:06.866 --> 21:08.668
Any leads on a shooter?

21:10.436 --> 21:12.038
A shooter?

21:12.271 --> 21:14.574
No, a car accident.

21:15.708 --> 21:19.445
Locals found her late last night
just outside the city.

21:19.479 --> 21:22.949
Her parents thought she was
in D.C. visiting a friend.

21:24.751 --> 21:29.389
Car had no plates.
Bag full of cash.

21:29.422 --> 21:31.858
Lauren was running.

21:31.891 --> 21:35.995
She was afraid for her life,
and Carrie warned me.

21:37.630 --> 21:41.000
And thanks to your client,
they're both dead.

21:42.568 --> 21:45.405
Normally I'd be happy
to throw Tariq under the bus.

21:46.839 --> 21:50.376
Until today,
he had an ankle monitor.

21:50.410 --> 21:51.878
Did it go off last night?

21:53.513 --> 21:54.781
No.

21:54.814 --> 21:56.349
And thus far,

21:56.382 --> 21:58.518
evidence points to Carrie
committed suicide.

21:58.551 --> 22:00.353
Isn't that suspicious?

22:00.386 --> 22:02.655
It's too perfect
to actually be a suicide.

22:02.689 --> 22:05.725
Or a career-driven woman
overcome by her feelings

22:05.758 --> 22:09.529
of anger, guilt, shame
felt powerless

22:09.562 --> 22:12.498
and took matters
into her own hands.

22:12.532 --> 22:13.900
Like I almost did.

22:16.102 --> 22:17.770
What are you talking about?

22:23.609 --> 22:25.111
James St. Patrick.

22:27.980 --> 22:30.817
Every witness or colleague
I lost,

22:30.850 --> 22:32.618
the more I wanted to nail him.

22:35.722 --> 22:39.592
I planted evidence against him,

22:39.625 --> 22:41.394
and I got caught.

22:41.427 --> 22:43.429
Tameika told me
I was going to jail...

22:45.431 --> 22:48.034
...so I grabbed a fucking gun.

22:50.937 --> 22:54.407
But I got lucky.
Someone got him first.

22:55.842 --> 22:58.911
Jesus, I...

22:58.945 --> 23:00.780
I had no idea.

23:02.882 --> 23:05.017
Never said it out loud before.

23:07.120 --> 23:08.554
But you...

23:13.693 --> 23:16.496
...you-you should take the L.

23:17.463 --> 23:18.965
Now, you go after Tariq again,

23:18.998 --> 23:22.068
another loss could derail
your career as a prosecutor.

23:22.101 --> 23:24.604
Isn't that what really matters?

23:24.637 --> 23:28.040
Just walk away.

23:28.074 --> 23:30.510
Just walk away
while you still can.

23:31.944 --> 23:34.781
You know, at some point, Saxe,

23:34.814 --> 23:37.583
walking away means
becoming an accomplice.

23:38.851 --> 23:41.821
And you wonder why
we can't be a real thing.

23:43.189 --> 23:44.724
It's because of this.

23:49.829 --> 23:51.798
<i>Thanks for the drink.</i>

23:54.100 --> 23:56.803
Keeping white boy
around worked out for you.

23:58.037 --> 23:59.572
Congratulations.

23:59.605 --> 24:01.908
Yeah, good looking, but I know
that's not why you called.

24:01.941 --> 24:03.876
You owe me a favor.

24:03.910 --> 24:05.144
I need you to help me
kill Mecca.

24:05.178 --> 24:06.546
Wait, if you wanna
kill the connect

24:06.546 --> 24:07.547
after we just robbed him,

24:07.547 --> 24:08.848
that don't seem too good
for business.

24:08.881 --> 24:10.550
Mecca's not just a connect.

24:10.583 --> 24:12.718
I knew him back in the day,
but I didn't know who he was

24:12.752 --> 24:14.954
'cause I knew him
as somebody else.

24:14.987 --> 24:16.622
Dante Spears, right?

24:18.624 --> 24:19.959
Yeah, he paid me a visit.

24:19.992 --> 24:22.195
I know Cane probably told you.

24:22.228 --> 24:23.663
You know, that bag
that we stole from him

24:23.696 --> 24:24.964
had a tracker in it
'cause there was something

24:24.997 --> 24:27.633
more important than just
a fucking diamond in there.

24:27.667 --> 24:29.869
It was papers
with his real name

24:29.902 --> 24:32.738
and the name of his son,
Ezekiel Cross.

24:32.772 --> 24:35.708
You knew all that?
Why keep you breathing?

24:35.741 --> 24:38.010
Hid the bag before
he could get to me.

24:38.044 --> 24:40.513
Plus, I'm the only one
that knows where the bag is.

24:40.546 --> 24:43.616
I mean, he made me
hold his tracker shit, but...

24:43.649 --> 24:46.118
once I give up that bag,
I'm just as good as dead.

24:51.157 --> 24:52.525
You know them papers also said

24:52.558 --> 24:54.227
that Mecca was a federal
informant too, right?

24:54.260 --> 24:55.928
A fucking snitch?

24:57.263 --> 24:58.898
Nah, fuck Mecca.
Fuck this nigga.

24:58.931 --> 25:01.667
He deserve every bullet
I'ma put in his ass now.

25:01.701 --> 25:03.736
Mecca think Lorenzo
stole his product.

25:03.769 --> 25:05.271
I'm sure that's what
you told him.

25:05.504 --> 25:07.540
What the fuck else
was I gonna tell this nigga?

25:07.573 --> 25:08.741
He believed me,
but he don't believe

25:08.774 --> 25:10.009
that he could trust Cane.

25:10.042 --> 25:11.210
So he want Cane to do Lorenzo

25:11.244 --> 25:13.846
on some
"test of loyalty" bullshit.

25:13.880 --> 25:17.016
Look, I need you to help Cane

25:17.049 --> 25:19.118
come up with a plan
to kill his father.

25:19.151 --> 25:21.921
Then I need you to help Cane
follow that plan long enough

25:21.954 --> 25:24.090
for me to kill Mecca first

25:24.123 --> 25:26.125
so I can save Lorenzo's life.

25:30.563 --> 25:33.966
A'ight, I'll help you,

25:34.000 --> 25:35.601
but I gotta keep it
a buck with you.

25:37.069 --> 25:38.938
I asked Mecca for some cash
in exchange for that bag,

25:38.971 --> 25:40.873
and I need him alive
long enough

25:40.907 --> 25:43.609
so I can get that money,
a'ight?

25:43.643 --> 25:44.911
Once I get that money,
you can do

25:44.944 --> 25:46.746
whatever the fuck
you wanna do with Mecca.

25:46.779 --> 25:48.915
And I'ma be outta
this game completely.

25:50.583 --> 25:51.651
I see.

25:55.554 --> 25:57.089
Okay, Tariq.

25:57.123 --> 26:00.226
Once Mecca's dead...

26:00.259 --> 26:01.727
you're free to go.

26:06.866 --> 26:09.101
Yeah, a'ight.

26:09.135 --> 26:12.571
A quarter shipment will work.
I got a new delivery spot.

26:12.605 --> 26:16.709
Plus, Mecca gets
his payment on time.

26:19.879 --> 26:20.980
So we got a audience

26:21.013 --> 26:23.115
listening to our
marital problems, Lorenzo?

26:25.718 --> 26:26.886
<i>McVey, Carlito,</i>

26:26.919 --> 26:28.888
why don't y'all go outside,
guard the door?

26:41.167 --> 26:42.768
You think I shot
at you and Zeke?

26:42.802 --> 26:45.004
I know it wasn't you.
It was Dante.

26:45.037 --> 26:47.206
He's the fucking connect,
Mecca.

26:47.239 --> 26:48.741
Been playing us the whole time.

26:48.774 --> 26:49.842
Bullshit.

26:49.875 --> 26:52.678
I wish it was.
Cane's in danger.

26:52.712 --> 26:53.813
Mecca thinks I'm down for him,

26:53.846 --> 26:56.882
but I'm only going along with this shit
to keep him from killing our son.

26:56.916 --> 26:58.117
When I spoke to Cane,
I asked him

26:58.150 --> 26:59.618
to come home;
he said he couldn't.

26:59.652 --> 27:00.653
Mecca won't let him
out of his sight

27:00.686 --> 27:01.854
unless it's to see me.

27:01.887 --> 27:05.658
That fucking soldier McVey,
he's Mecca's.

27:05.691 --> 27:07.159
I thought that nigga
was doing me a favor.

27:07.193 --> 27:08.828
He's been keeping tabs on us?

27:08.861 --> 27:11.063
Look, our whole family's
in danger.

27:11.097 --> 27:13.232
Do you believe I'll do whatever
it takes to save our children?

27:13.265 --> 27:14.834
Yeah, even when
shit's going bad for us,

27:14.867 --> 27:16.235
you always put them first.

27:16.268 --> 27:18.137
Well, thank you
for giving me that.

27:18.170 --> 27:20.973
Now, Mecca wants you dead,
and he wants Cane to do it.

27:21.007 --> 27:24.043
But we gotta make him believe
that Cane will.

27:24.076 --> 27:25.878
I got Tariq helping us.

27:25.911 --> 27:27.880
You gotta get Dru
and Diana on board.

27:27.913 --> 27:30.049
Tariq has a plan,
and he's gonna need their help.

27:31.717 --> 27:34.653
So you got all this shit
figured out, huh?

27:34.687 --> 27:36.856
When do I put
the bullet into Mecca?

27:36.889 --> 27:38.991
You don't. I am.

27:39.025 --> 27:41.093
Nah, that's my job, Mon.

27:41.127 --> 27:42.361
I protect the family.

27:42.395 --> 27:44.397
Look, fuck all that.

27:44.430 --> 27:46.999
You go to Mecca's,
his soldiers put a bullet

27:47.033 --> 27:48.768
in Cane, Dru, and Diana.

27:48.801 --> 27:49.969
You want that?

27:53.239 --> 27:55.408
- Trust Monet?
- Lie to Cane?

27:55.441 --> 27:57.043
And Tariq's part of this too?

27:57.076 --> 27:58.444
Papi, that sounds sus.

27:58.677 --> 28:00.379
We all need to put
our personal shit

28:00.413 --> 28:02.214
with Monet aside, okay?

28:03.449 --> 28:06.085
If Monet wanted Pops dead,
she'd have shot him already.

28:06.118 --> 28:08.687
Yeah, well, maybe there's
something else she needs.

28:08.721 --> 28:11.791
Yes, there is--to save Cane.
We all need to.

28:11.824 --> 28:14.093
You think Monet's gonna let
something bad happen to Cane?

28:14.126 --> 28:16.162
Fuck, no, but, Papi,
what if the plan don't work

28:16.195 --> 28:17.863
or Mecca finds out
what we're doing?

28:17.897 --> 28:19.432
Well, let's just hope
it doesn't get to that, right?

28:22.435 --> 28:24.870
Family always first.

28:24.904 --> 28:26.172
Remember that.

28:27.873 --> 28:29.842
So what's up?

28:29.875 --> 28:31.277
We ready to do this or what?

28:32.945 --> 28:34.046
I'm in.

28:36.348 --> 28:38.150
Me too.

28:38.184 --> 28:40.386
I'ma hit up Tariq and find out
what he needs from me and Di.

28:40.419 --> 28:42.822
Good. And keep me posted.

28:51.730 --> 28:52.898
Bro, did you empty
the dead drop?

28:52.932 --> 28:54.867
Fuck you talking about?

28:54.900 --> 28:56.368
When would I even
have time to do that?

28:57.269 --> 28:58.871
Where you going?

28:58.904 --> 29:00.806
My dad's pulling me
out of school.

29:00.840 --> 29:02.174
Looks like you'll be
booked here running shit

29:02.208 --> 29:05.978
while I'm sitting in a fucking cubicle
at my family's hedge fund.

29:06.011 --> 29:09.849
CourseCorrect's dead,
but our publicity's fire, bro.

29:09.882 --> 29:11.517
I mean, all we would need to do
is just get some more product

29:11.750 --> 29:12.785
and we're good,
we're back in the--

29:12.818 --> 29:14.186
Yo, listen.

29:14.220 --> 29:16.388
Was my card used to open
any lockers recently?

29:18.290 --> 29:20.426
Yeah, last two times.

29:23.529 --> 29:25.931
Fucking Diana.

29:25.965 --> 29:28.300
She was here the other day.
She probably swiped my code.

29:28.334 --> 29:29.902
Diana, what a fucking savage.

29:31.770 --> 29:33.539
Whatever, listen.

29:33.772 --> 29:36.375
Yesterday, man,
you held that shit down, bro.

29:36.408 --> 29:39.145
I really can't even
repay you for that.

29:39.178 --> 29:42.414
But you gotta know that I'm...

29:42.448 --> 29:43.816
I'm outta this shit, B.

29:43.849 --> 29:45.784
- 'Riq, come on.
- Bro, I'm out.

29:45.818 --> 29:47.920
A'ight, this is my chance
to hold it down for Yasmine,

29:47.953 --> 29:50.089
just like you
held it down for Trace.

29:50.122 --> 29:51.824
Yes, I know Trace wasn't sick.

29:51.857 --> 29:54.260
I know he was supposed
to testify, but it's all good.

29:54.293 --> 29:57.029
I ain't tripping.
You handled it.

29:57.062 --> 29:58.964
We just can't let
Cane find out.

29:58.998 --> 30:00.266
Facts.

30:02.034 --> 30:04.837
Uh, yo, how'd it go
with Lauren?

30:04.870 --> 30:08.207
I've given her a few calls,
but she-she's not answering.

30:09.141 --> 30:10.976
Lauren drove off without me.

30:11.010 --> 30:14.847
Um, I told her no phone,
so she's laying low.

30:15.981 --> 30:18.317
Yeah, she's smart.
She'll be fine.

30:18.350 --> 30:20.452
It's probably better we don't know
where she went, anyways, right?

30:22.454 --> 30:23.889
Yeah, I guess.
Yeah, you're right.

30:25.157 --> 30:27.226
Ooh, see y'all still
ain't locking this door,

30:27.259 --> 30:28.827
huh, Dumb and Dumber?

30:29.995 --> 30:31.297
What the fuck
are you doing here?

30:31.330 --> 30:33.532
Mm...

30:33.566 --> 30:35.301
you's a free man now.

30:35.334 --> 30:37.870
Heard Casper here kept it
ten toes down.

30:37.903 --> 30:39.338
Took care of all
that shit, right?

30:40.906 --> 30:43.976
Yeah, I took care of it all,
everything.

30:44.009 --> 30:45.144
We're all good.

30:46.912 --> 30:49.915
All right, I'ma head out.
Catch you later, bro.

30:49.949 --> 30:50.950
Mm-hmm.

30:52.184 --> 30:53.285
That's cute.

31:05.898 --> 31:08.434
I know why you're here.
Monet sent you.

31:11.937 --> 31:13.505
Hey, Mecca wants you
to do this shit alone,

31:13.539 --> 31:15.608
so I'ma ditch this.

31:15.641 --> 31:18.010
<i>I forwarded the calls,
and if he tracks me,</i>

31:18.043 --> 31:19.311
<i>it'll look like
I'm still on campus.</i>

31:21.113 --> 31:23.282
And what if he comes
looking for you?

31:23.315 --> 31:24.516
Your mom'll handle it.

31:25.884 --> 31:28.287
Yo, you sure you ready
to do some shit like this?

31:28.320 --> 31:31.156
- Kill Lorenzo?
- Nigga, know who the fuck I am?

31:31.190 --> 31:32.558
Get the fuck outta here.

31:32.591 --> 31:34.927
Now's not the time to act like you know
what the fuck you doing, a'ight?

31:34.960 --> 31:36.562
'Cause I know you don't.

31:36.595 --> 31:40.933
Listen, I killed my dad
to save my family.

31:40.966 --> 31:41.967
A'ight?

31:42.001 --> 31:44.603
Dru, Monet, Diana--

31:44.637 --> 31:47.606
Mecca'll go after all of them
if you don't kill Lorenzo.

31:47.640 --> 31:49.241
And he'll make sure
you're the last one alive

31:49.275 --> 31:51.510
so you can see all of them die
right in front of your face.

31:51.543 --> 31:53.512
You know what type
of nigga he is.

31:57.283 --> 31:59.285
You don't have a choice.

31:59.318 --> 32:01.954
Just like I ain't
have a choice.

32:01.987 --> 32:06.025
So just get ready, man,
'cause after this shit,

32:06.058 --> 32:08.360
you ain't never
gonna be the same, Cane.

32:31.016 --> 32:33.385
Ezekiel Cross,
this is a surprise.

32:35.421 --> 32:37.122
May I help you?

32:37.723 --> 32:39.458
Uh...

32:39.491 --> 32:41.260
Carrie--I mean...

32:43.362 --> 32:44.663
...Professor Milgram.

32:46.365 --> 32:47.666
You got her case, right?

32:49.968 --> 32:52.004
Y'all still think
it's a suicide?

32:55.240 --> 32:57.376
You found her body, Zeke.

32:57.409 --> 32:59.345
Medical examiner confirmed it.

33:01.280 --> 33:02.614
But if you've got something
you'd like to share,

33:02.648 --> 33:04.717
we have an open-door
policy around here.

33:06.185 --> 33:07.653
Is there something
you need to tell me?

33:09.288 --> 33:10.656
I was just making sure.

33:12.758 --> 33:14.026
Thank you.

33:26.205 --> 33:28.340
Hey, look,
I'd like to say I'm surprised,

33:28.374 --> 33:30.209
but I actually
knew you back then.

33:30.242 --> 33:31.443
Okay, this is
when I was in college.

33:31.477 --> 33:32.711
It was a long time ago.

33:32.745 --> 33:34.580
I mean, how the hell
did you even get this?

33:34.613 --> 33:36.281
<i>Your finest scotch, please.</i>

33:39.451 --> 33:42.488
And guilty as charged.

33:45.791 --> 33:47.326
Okay, Steven, I mean, come on.

33:47.359 --> 33:49.128
You're not caving in
to this BLM bullshit.

33:49.161 --> 33:50.462
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- I mean, you know,

33:50.496 --> 33:51.797
this is ancient history;
it's a fucking Halloween party.

33:52.030 --> 33:53.732
"Blackface Leaves Black Mark

33:53.766 --> 33:56.268
as Disgraced Congressman
Vacates Office."

33:56.301 --> 33:59.171
A headline like that
certainly goes viral.

33:59.204 --> 34:00.639
What, and you're okay
with this, Steven?

34:00.672 --> 34:03.375
No, but I'd like to avoid
that headline,

34:03.409 --> 34:06.078
which is why we're gonna
control the narrative.

34:06.111 --> 34:08.480
Listen to me,
we schedule a press conference.

34:08.514 --> 34:10.048
I don't know,
a family member got cancer.

34:10.082 --> 34:12.818
You found God, whatever
the excuse, you give it.

34:13.051 --> 34:15.754
You step down, you endorse
Rashad as your replacement,

34:15.788 --> 34:17.823
and that's how it's gonna go.

34:18.056 --> 34:21.260
Hey, look, you had a good run,
you know, until you didn't.

34:21.293 --> 34:23.629
My record is spotless.

34:23.662 --> 34:25.431
I mean, I survived
this "Me Too" bullshit.

34:25.464 --> 34:26.732
I mean, surely you can't--

34:26.765 --> 34:28.434
Yeah, just go easy
on the bronzer.

34:28.467 --> 34:29.768
You know, for the cameras.

34:29.802 --> 34:32.504
- You smug, arrogant--
- <i>Nigga?</i>

34:32.538 --> 34:34.506
Hmm?

34:34.540 --> 34:36.542
That's about
to take your fucking job.

34:38.844 --> 34:41.713
Go ahead. Publish the photo.

34:41.747 --> 34:43.816
In six months, the public
will have forgotten

34:43.849 --> 34:45.717
about this nonsense
all on their own.

34:45.751 --> 34:49.588
I wouldn't say that,
but perhaps...

34:49.621 --> 34:53.392
...after six months
and some much-needed time off,

34:53.425 --> 34:55.828
you decide to, uh,
run for Senate

34:55.861 --> 34:57.763
with the backing of a solid
freshman Congressman

34:57.796 --> 35:00.132
and, of course,
our mutual friend here.

35:00.165 --> 35:01.700
Exactly, by which time,
we could easily

35:01.733 --> 35:03.635
put in a good word
for a cabinet position.

35:03.669 --> 35:05.838
I don't know, Interior,
maybe HUD?

35:05.871 --> 35:08.307
Shit, if Ben Carson can do it.

35:08.340 --> 35:12.211
So what do you say,
Rick, my boy?

35:14.213 --> 35:15.647
Fuck you, Rashad.

35:23.722 --> 35:27.125
Yeah. I'll do it.

35:31.463 --> 35:33.131
Good luck with him, Steven.

35:34.666 --> 35:35.868
You're gonna need it.

35:41.773 --> 35:43.542
We need to end
this beef right now.

35:44.743 --> 35:46.912
Lorenzo and Tariq set up GTG.

35:47.145 --> 35:48.914
They stole my product.

35:49.147 --> 35:50.415
They're our enemy.

35:50.449 --> 35:52.618
Me and you,
we need to start over,

35:52.651 --> 35:53.685
rebuild trust.

35:55.187 --> 35:57.823
You want me to dead Lorenzo
so we can rebuild trust?

35:57.856 --> 36:00.926
It's an opportunity for you to show me
what you're really made of.

36:01.159 --> 36:03.328
Now I have arranged to have
a small shipment

36:03.362 --> 36:05.197
delivered to Lorenzo
tomorrow night.

36:05.230 --> 36:06.832
You could do it then.

36:06.865 --> 36:09.434
He will never see you coming.

36:09.468 --> 36:11.570
If you want the top spot,

36:11.603 --> 36:14.373
killing Lorenzo shows me
that you're ready to be me.

36:14.406 --> 36:16.408
And who the fuck are you, again?

36:16.441 --> 36:18.911
'Cause I thought you were the connect,
but you're also Zeke's pops.

36:18.944 --> 36:20.445
You lied to me.

36:20.479 --> 36:22.514
I move weight.

36:22.548 --> 36:23.782
Drugs and guns.

36:23.815 --> 36:25.884
I'm part of an international
distribution chain.

36:25.918 --> 36:28.453
Ain't shit changed
in that regard.

36:28.487 --> 36:30.255
Neither has my offer to you.

36:31.390 --> 36:34.593
So I do this, I take over
your business in New York?

36:35.961 --> 36:38.430
You don't sound convinced.

36:38.463 --> 36:41.867
I wish I could prove it to you,
but the proof is in the bag

36:41.900 --> 36:43.602
that Tariq is holding
for ransom.

36:46.271 --> 36:47.773
Why don't we just dead Tariq?

36:47.806 --> 36:49.575
I know all his hiding spots.

36:49.608 --> 36:51.910
We can check those after I put him
in the fucking ground.

36:51.944 --> 36:53.812
We will, but not right now.

36:53.845 --> 36:56.815
I got eyes on Tariq.
I'll get my bag.

36:56.848 --> 36:57.983
Either way, you right.

36:58.216 --> 36:59.818
Tariq has overstayed
his fucking welcome.

37:00.919 --> 37:02.754
What are y'all talking about?

37:02.788 --> 37:04.423
<i>You spoke to Zeke?</i>

37:05.290 --> 37:06.925
Zeke ain't coming with us.

37:06.959 --> 37:08.260
And after speaking to 'Renzo,

37:08.293 --> 37:09.995
Dru and Diana
ain't coming either.

37:10.228 --> 37:12.564
Hmm, maybe we should delay
our departure,

37:12.598 --> 37:13.899
give Zeke some time
to reconsider.

37:13.932 --> 37:15.567
Look, he needs some space.

37:15.601 --> 37:17.636
If we leave,
I think he'll follow us.

37:19.004 --> 37:20.739
Yeah.

37:34.252 --> 37:35.287
Fuck you want?

37:35.320 --> 37:36.788
<i>I see you're at school.</i>

37:36.822 --> 37:37.823
Yep.

37:37.856 --> 37:39.625
Look, meet me tomorrow night
at my hangar.

37:39.658 --> 37:40.926
I'll have what you want.

37:40.959 --> 37:43.962
All right, bet.
See you tomorrow.

37:43.996 --> 37:45.497
Mr. St. Patrick,

37:45.530 --> 37:47.399
thanks for meeting me out here.

37:47.432 --> 37:49.801
Well, uh, it's official.

37:49.835 --> 37:51.770
Yasmine's adoption
has been stopped,

37:51.803 --> 37:54.840
and custody is reverting
back to you.

37:54.873 --> 37:56.642
I know this has been
quite a journey

37:56.675 --> 37:59.277
for you and your sister.

37:59.311 --> 38:02.814
Are you absolutely sure that
this is what's best for her?

38:02.848 --> 38:04.416
I am.

38:04.449 --> 38:06.351
Understood.

38:06.385 --> 38:09.955
Uh, by the way,
I am very sorry, Tariq.

38:09.988 --> 38:11.723
About?

38:12.891 --> 38:14.292
What the fuck is he doing here?

38:14.326 --> 38:15.527
Mr. Saxe called me.

38:15.560 --> 38:19.831
He said he had
some news for you, so, um...

38:19.865 --> 38:21.867
I'll leave you to it.

38:21.900 --> 38:23.368
Thank you.

38:25.437 --> 38:27.773
This better not be
some bullshit, Saxe.

38:27.806 --> 38:28.840
What is it?

38:30.375 --> 38:32.944
Lauren Baldwin is dead.

38:37.649 --> 38:39.618
You didn't know?

38:39.651 --> 38:41.853
No, no. How?

38:41.887 --> 38:43.455
What, you think I had
something to do with it?

38:43.488 --> 38:44.856
That's why you came over here?

38:44.890 --> 38:47.359
I wasn't sure.

38:47.392 --> 38:50.462
I'm sorry.
I knew you two were close.

38:50.495 --> 38:52.597
I haven't told Davis yet.

38:52.631 --> 38:54.433
She died in a car accident.

38:54.466 --> 38:55.767
Are you sure
it was an accident?

38:55.801 --> 38:57.069
That's what the locals think.

38:57.102 --> 38:59.571
My question is, do you?

39:01.606 --> 39:04.876
Tariq, if you know something,
tell me.

39:04.910 --> 39:07.446
I told Lauren to get
out of town for her safety.

39:07.479 --> 39:09.114
That's all I know.

39:09.347 --> 39:11.483
Are you the only person
that knew she was leaving town?

39:12.651 --> 39:14.052
Cane Tejada know?

39:15.654 --> 39:17.489
I gotta go.

39:27.766 --> 39:28.867
Saxe.

39:30.035 --> 39:31.436
Impressive, huh?

39:31.470 --> 39:33.605
Ah.

39:33.638 --> 39:36.975
Can we talk? In private?

39:37.008 --> 39:39.945
Uh, Crystal, give us a moment.

39:47.052 --> 39:48.520
What now?

39:49.955 --> 39:51.556
We have blood on our hands.

39:53.058 --> 39:55.727
You let Tariq hear the wire.

39:55.761 --> 39:57.395
Did you let Cane hear it too?

39:57.429 --> 39:59.064
Get the fuck outta here, man.
You stupid?

39:59.097 --> 40:01.767
No. Lauren Baldwin is dead.

40:03.135 --> 40:05.437
Yeah, and Carrie,

40:05.470 --> 40:07.606
who you said wasn't the type
to commit suicide.

40:07.639 --> 40:09.674
Both were tied up
in that recording.

40:10.776 --> 40:12.544
And you think I'm responsible?

40:14.746 --> 40:17.516
After I told you I knew Carrie.

40:17.549 --> 40:20.051
Oh, what, you-you saying
you had feelings for her?

40:20.085 --> 40:21.987
Come on, after what you did
to her on the stand?

40:22.020 --> 40:23.622
Especially then, hmm?

40:23.655 --> 40:25.924
Not that it's any
of your business,

40:25.957 --> 40:29.494
but I would never have
put Carrie in danger.

40:29.528 --> 40:32.464
You took money
from Cane Tejada.

40:32.497 --> 40:35.834
And you framed
James St. Patrick for murder.

40:35.867 --> 40:37.936
Don't come in here
waving your sanctimonious

40:37.969 --> 40:40.705
self-hatred at me.

40:40.739 --> 40:43.742
I've accepted who I am.

40:43.775 --> 40:45.811
Survival of the fittest.

40:45.844 --> 40:49.147
That's what I do, survive.

40:51.983 --> 40:55.620
And so do you.
We're the fucking same.

41:02.060 --> 41:03.995
You got that other case
I left you?

41:05.163 --> 41:07.966
Oh, Theo Rollins?

41:07.999 --> 41:11.803
I could tell you, unlike Tariq and Cane,
Rollins is innocent.

41:13.605 --> 41:14.906
You're sure?

41:14.940 --> 41:16.908
Yeah, someone else clearly
committed the manslaughter.

41:16.942 --> 41:18.743
The prosecutor
suppressed evidence

41:18.777 --> 41:20.478
that indicated
the actual assailant

41:20.512 --> 41:23.582
was at least four inches taller
than Theo Rollins.

41:26.218 --> 41:28.186
Then why is he still inside?

41:29.187 --> 41:30.822
I'm working on it.

41:30.856 --> 41:33.191
Well, work harder.

41:33.225 --> 41:35.727
This is the most important case
at this firm,

41:35.760 --> 41:38.930
and...

41:38.964 --> 41:41.066
I'm trusting you.

41:45.570 --> 41:47.272
This shit
is all my fucking fault.

41:47.505 --> 41:49.574
Hey, don't do that, okay?

41:49.608 --> 41:50.709
You did everything you could

41:50.742 --> 41:51.810
despite her
wearing a wire on you.

41:51.843 --> 41:53.778
Effie, Lauren would've
still been alive

41:53.812 --> 41:55.513
if she hadn't met me, a'ight?

41:55.547 --> 41:56.882
Everyone around me
either ends up dead

41:56.915 --> 41:58.550
or has to go away
because of my shit,

41:58.583 --> 41:59.851
and that's exactly
why I'm all on my own.

41:59.885 --> 42:01.586
That's not true.

42:01.620 --> 42:03.655
You have me, Brayden.

42:03.688 --> 42:05.056
You have people.

42:05.090 --> 42:07.659
And I really fuck with you.

42:07.692 --> 42:09.694
You're not alone, okay?

42:10.695 --> 42:13.632
I know I got people, Effie,
it's just...

42:15.667 --> 42:17.602
...I don't want Yasmine
to end up like Raina.

42:20.639 --> 42:23.041
You know, maybe me
being around her

42:23.074 --> 42:24.709
isn't the best way
to protect her.

43:36.014 --> 43:37.916
<i>Vanessa Edwards.</i>

43:41.386 --> 43:44.889
Vanessa Edwards,
special delivery.

43:53.198 --> 43:54.265
Who is it?

43:55.800 --> 43:57.235
Tasha, it's me.

44:11.049 --> 44:13.651
Tameika,
what are you doing here?

44:13.685 --> 44:14.719
Did something happen?

44:14.753 --> 44:16.254
Not what you think.

44:19.024 --> 44:20.825
Mommy!

44:20.859 --> 44:23.128
Yasmine! Oh, my baby.

44:23.161 --> 44:24.863
Oh, come here.

44:26.164 --> 44:30.068
Oh, I can't believe it.
Are you okay?

44:30.101 --> 44:31.269
I missed you.

44:33.671 --> 44:36.374
Thank you. Thank you.

44:36.408 --> 44:38.009
You're welcome.

44:39.677 --> 44:42.213
Start packing.
You're about to be on the move.

44:42.247 --> 44:43.882
Grab her stuff.

44:52.090 --> 44:54.793
So where's Tariq?
Did he do this?

44:55.894 --> 44:58.430
I'm not familiar
with that name, Vanessa.

44:59.898 --> 45:01.066
I'm only gonna say this once,

45:01.099 --> 45:03.968
so I need you both
to hear me well.

45:04.002 --> 45:07.105
Whoever this Tariq person is,
he can't be here.

45:07.138 --> 45:10.208
I pulled a lot of strings
just to get you Olivia.

45:11.276 --> 45:13.778
<i>Tell your mother what
we talked about in the car.</i>

45:14.779 --> 45:16.881
My name's
Olivia Nicole Edwards.

45:16.915 --> 45:20.452
I was born July ninth
in Fort Wayne, Indiana.

45:20.485 --> 45:22.053
I have no brothers or sisters,

45:22.087 --> 45:24.889
but I really want
a cocker spaniel.

45:24.923 --> 45:26.825
Here's her paperwork.

45:32.197 --> 45:34.065
I just need to know
if he's okay.

45:34.099 --> 45:35.733
I understand.

45:35.767 --> 45:38.803
But my advice to both of you
would be to move on.

45:38.837 --> 45:40.405
You have a chance
to build a new life

45:40.438 --> 45:42.107
for yourselves together.

45:42.140 --> 45:44.142
And I suggest
you focus on that.

45:45.110 --> 45:49.747
As for anyone who is not here,
I wouldn't get your hopes up.

45:54.152 --> 45:57.021
Don't underestimate my son,
Tameika.

45:57.055 --> 46:00.024
That boy will surprise you.
I promise you that.

46:00.058 --> 46:02.360
He's already surprised me.

46:08.299 --> 46:11.102
Oh, missed you so much.

46:21.212 --> 46:22.914
<i>Hey, hey.</i>

46:22.947 --> 46:24.849
You know the deal, Tariq.

46:24.883 --> 46:26.417
They can't see you.

46:26.451 --> 46:29.320
As far as they're concerned,
you don't exist.

46:31.856 --> 46:34.259
Yeah, as long as I'm not around,
they'll be safe, right?

46:36.194 --> 46:39.030
Yo, you know someone
named Dante Spears?

46:39.063 --> 46:40.331
Well, shit, yeah.

46:40.365 --> 46:43.134
High-level federal informant.
You know him?

46:43.168 --> 46:46.004
I just found out he's the reason
y'all went after Lobos.

46:46.037 --> 46:48.106
Lobos, Jimenez.

46:48.139 --> 46:49.440
He racked up so much bad blood,

46:49.474 --> 46:51.509
he was sanctioned
from reentering the U.S.

46:51.543 --> 46:54.012
for his own safety.

46:55.847 --> 46:59.384
Without Dante, Eastern District
would've never mounted

46:59.417 --> 47:01.886
an investigation
into your father.

47:03.221 --> 47:06.357
Angela and him, who knows?

47:09.994 --> 47:11.362
That's what I thought.

47:24.042 --> 47:26.844
Shit is identical.
They're perfect.

47:26.878 --> 47:28.580
Okay, Detective.
What are we doing with these?

47:30.215 --> 47:31.516
You ever play Three Card Monte?

47:33.117 --> 47:35.253
As a kid, yeah.

47:35.286 --> 47:37.222
Lost every time.

47:37.255 --> 47:39.190
Usual thing, three cards.

47:39.224 --> 47:41.993
I had to pick the money card
to win, but it was a hustle.

47:42.026 --> 47:44.596
There was never any money card
'cause Cane would distract me

47:44.629 --> 47:46.464
and use D to steal the card
when I wasn't looking.

47:46.497 --> 47:49.033
See, you ain't notice
because all the cards

47:49.067 --> 47:50.902
on the back
look exactly the same

47:50.935 --> 47:52.337
and you underestimated
your baby sister.

47:53.871 --> 47:55.907
Look, basically, our plan
is the same shit, all right,

47:55.940 --> 47:58.576
except Mecca's bag,
that's the real money card.

47:58.610 --> 48:00.511
He got all his eyes
on us, a'ight?

48:00.545 --> 48:02.413
So we gotta use that
to our advantage.

48:02.447 --> 48:05.617
We use ourselves as bait
so Mecca has to follow us.

48:05.650 --> 48:07.518
Exactly.
We spread out his manpower.

48:07.552 --> 48:09.020
While he's too busy
watching us,

48:09.053 --> 48:10.888
Diana goes and grabs
the real bag.

48:12.957 --> 48:15.093
But how's Diana gonna know
where you hid the bag?

48:16.060 --> 48:18.496
Same place you motherfuckers
stole my drugs from.

48:21.266 --> 48:23.001
Shit.

48:25.136 --> 48:26.271
All right, look, man,
about that--

48:26.304 --> 48:27.939
I don't give a fuck, a'ight?

48:27.972 --> 48:29.374
It's all right.

48:29.407 --> 48:32.577
Look, by the time
Diana gives me the real bag,

48:32.610 --> 48:33.978
Mecca's men will be
cleared out,

48:34.012 --> 48:35.513
and he'll think Cane
finished Lorenzo.

48:36.614 --> 48:39.484
<i>Once I get the real bag from Diana,
I'll meet Mecca at the hangar,</i>

48:39.517 --> 48:41.953
and I'll help Monet
finish the job.

48:41.986 --> 48:44.322
It's just in case
anything goes south,

48:44.355 --> 48:46.090
we gotta make sure
Diana does not look

48:46.124 --> 48:47.625
into that real bag, a'ight?

48:47.659 --> 48:49.394
It gives her
plausible deniability.

48:51.162 --> 48:52.330
I got you.

48:52.363 --> 48:54.132
A'ight.

49:13.951 --> 49:15.320
- Got your piece?
- In the glove box.

49:15.353 --> 49:17.055
Good.
I gotta get to the warehouse.

49:17.088 --> 49:20.325
I'll meet you there later, Dru.
Both of you, watch your backs.

49:20.358 --> 49:22.660
<i>- Sí,</i> Papi.
- Bet.

49:23.728 --> 49:25.463
I gotta keep moving.

49:25.496 --> 49:28.266
Promise me, do not look
in the bag, all right?

49:28.299 --> 49:29.500
I won't.

49:29.534 --> 49:31.235
Di, promise me.

49:31.269 --> 49:34.072
Dru, I said I won't, okay?

50:06.571 --> 50:09.173
McVey, you were right.

50:09.207 --> 50:11.776
<i>Stay close to Lorenzo.
He has the bag.</i>

50:12.009 --> 50:14.045
<i>I'll follow Dru.
Something's up.</i>

50:18.783 --> 50:20.718
That was taken
from a traffic cam

50:20.752 --> 50:22.620
the night of Carrie's suicide.

50:23.554 --> 50:26.023
That fits within the coroner's
window of time of death.

50:26.057 --> 50:28.559
And it's just blocks
from her apartment.

50:28.593 --> 50:31.162
Is this what you wanted to talk
to me about the other night?

50:33.531 --> 50:36.200
Uh, my Aunt Monet was--

50:36.234 --> 50:37.635
She was coming to pick me up.

50:39.270 --> 50:42.073
I was a few blocks away.

50:42.106 --> 50:44.542
This is before you found Carrie's body
in her apartment?

50:45.777 --> 50:48.079
Yeah.

50:48.112 --> 50:51.649
I ended up changing my mind

50:51.682 --> 50:53.718
and decided to go see Carrie.

50:58.689 --> 51:00.758
Okay, well,

51:00.792 --> 51:04.629
if that's the best you can do
for Carrie Milgram, then...

51:04.662 --> 51:05.830
thanks for your cooperation.

Mecca's delivery
should arrive any minute now.

52:15.633 --> 52:17.435
A'ight, so we wait.

52:24.342 --> 52:26.377
Hey, yo, you know
my girl, Lauren?

52:28.713 --> 52:32.183
I thought you was, um,
smashing that Effie chick.

52:32.216 --> 52:33.484
She bad as fuck.

52:33.518 --> 52:35.486
Yeah, well, you can keep
your eyes to yourself, nigga.

52:36.521 --> 52:38.689
Yeah, whatever, nigga. Fuck.

52:40.691 --> 52:43.494
Hey, what's up with that bag
we stole from Mecca?

52:43.528 --> 52:44.529
What else was in there?

52:44.562 --> 52:45.563
I don't know,

52:45.596 --> 52:47.465
and I don't give a fuck,
a'ight?

52:47.498 --> 52:49.500
Seems cap now that you do
all of a sudden.

52:49.534 --> 52:50.835
Nigga, you cap.

52:50.868 --> 52:52.670
You ain't risking your life
for some shit you don't know.

52:52.703 --> 52:54.906
Nigga, why are you
always worried about me

52:54.939 --> 52:57.875
when you need to worry about what it is
that you need to do?

53:00.711 --> 53:02.280
They're here.

53:11.289 --> 53:13.591
A'ight, don't overthink.
Just do it.

53:13.624 --> 53:15.192
You never know
what the fuck I think.

53:44.388 --> 53:45.556
Looks good.

54:02.406 --> 54:04.642
Cane, stop.
He knows we're here.

54:10.815 --> 54:12.316
What?

54:13.584 --> 54:15.686
Come here.

54:15.720 --> 54:17.254
Go check the bag.

54:18.556 --> 54:19.890
<i>Make sure it's Mecca's.</i>

54:29.000 --> 54:30.534
Monet's killing Mecca, a'ight?

54:30.568 --> 54:32.670
She just had to Mecca think
you was killing your pops

54:32.703 --> 54:34.705
so that Mecca could trust you.

54:34.739 --> 54:36.607
So I'm not killing Lorenzo?

54:36.641 --> 54:38.409
Nah.

54:38.442 --> 54:39.677
Monet lied to me.

54:40.778 --> 54:42.413
Yeah, we're here
to kill Mecca's people.

54:51.022 --> 54:52.857
The bag's a fake.
It's a setup!

55:44.475 --> 55:45.743
You stole my fucking drugs.

55:45.776 --> 55:47.778
You had that shit coming
for a long time, Tariq.

55:47.812 --> 55:49.113
What the fuck is going on?

55:49.346 --> 55:51.582
Now is not
the fucking time, Cane.

55:51.615 --> 55:53.484
Our shit we talk about at home.

55:54.852 --> 55:56.687
Yo, where's Dru?

55:56.721 --> 55:57.955
Oh, shit.
I think I know where he is.

55:57.988 --> 55:59.356
Let's go get him.

56:00.825 --> 56:02.493
Nigga, you coming?

56:02.526 --> 56:04.662
I gotta get Diana.
She picked up the real bag.

56:04.695 --> 56:06.697
She in on this too?

56:06.731 --> 56:08.499
Shit. Cold world.

56:13.904 --> 56:16.807
He done. Go.

56:45.169 --> 56:47.071
Hey, I think my cover's
been compromised.

56:47.104 --> 56:50.074
I'll be in touch,
but I thought you should know.

57:02.186 --> 57:04.588
<i>There's been a delay
in refueling the jet.</i>

57:04.622 --> 57:06.123
Let's have Tariq meet us here
to save time.

57:06.157 --> 57:07.591
Can you text him?

57:07.625 --> 57:08.959
Yeah, I'll text him.

57:11.495 --> 57:14.698
Any word from Cane?
He should be done by now.

57:14.732 --> 57:16.700
He's probably
chopping up the body.

57:18.469 --> 57:19.570
Yeah.

57:30.514 --> 57:32.817
Look, when security
issued me a new student ID,

57:32.850 --> 57:34.652
they asked if I went
into a restricted building

57:34.685 --> 57:35.820
I hadn't even heard of.

57:35.853 --> 57:38.122
- You think that it was me?
- Well, was it?

57:38.155 --> 57:39.690
You said you would never
lie to me.

57:39.723 --> 57:40.925
Me?
You said this was an emergency.

57:40.958 --> 57:42.026
A school ID ain't it.

57:42.059 --> 57:44.562
My ability to trust you
is an emergency.

57:45.629 --> 57:46.864
Unless you disagree.

57:50.167 --> 57:53.537
Oh, shit, I gotta go.
I'm late for practice.

57:53.571 --> 57:56.740
Okay, we'll talk
about this later, all right?

57:56.774 --> 57:58.676
I promise.

58:10.621 --> 58:12.623
Hey!

58:12.656 --> 58:14.158
Have a good practice.

58:26.070 --> 58:28.272
Hey, yo, Dru!

58:28.505 --> 58:30.975
Carlito? What you doing here?

58:33.010 --> 58:34.011
My man.

58:39.617 --> 58:41.819
<i>Check the bag.</i>

58:50.661 --> 58:52.229
It's empty.

58:52.263 --> 58:54.832
That means Lorenzo's bag
is probably empty too, huh?

59:01.071 --> 59:04.575
BSK motherfuckers.
Stabbed us in the back.

59:05.776 --> 59:07.778
You working for Mecca now?

59:07.811 --> 59:09.246
Why work for the distro

59:09.280 --> 59:11.849
when you can work
for the connect?

59:11.882 --> 59:15.853
Plus, the way your pops did Kino,
that was dirty.

59:15.886 --> 59:17.121
Payback's a mother.

59:20.791 --> 59:22.660
Where's the real bag, Dru?

59:23.928 --> 59:26.196
It'll be over soon
if you just tell us.

59:31.001 --> 59:32.970
What's the fun in that?

1:00:10.207 --> 1:00:11.842
Wait, wait.

1:00:11.875 --> 1:00:13.677
<i>No, no, no. Whoa.</i>

1:00:16.680 --> 1:00:18.615
Not right here.

1:00:18.649 --> 1:00:20.284
Let's put this motherfucker
in the trunk.

1:00:20.317 --> 1:00:22.019
Pops gonna make an example
out of him.

1:00:30.995 --> 1:00:32.329
Glad you're a'ight.

1:00:32.363 --> 1:00:34.732
Nice to have you back
saving my ass.

1:00:42.706 --> 1:00:44.241
Where's Dru?

1:00:44.274 --> 1:00:45.676
Cane checked in with Dru.
They're good.

1:00:45.709 --> 1:00:46.910
Already on the way back.

1:00:46.944 --> 1:00:48.145
And Tariq has the bag.

1:00:48.178 --> 1:00:49.780
And Monet?

1:00:49.813 --> 1:00:51.181
Did you hear
if her part's going okay?

1:00:54.284 --> 1:00:57.287
You know what, um, let me
fix you a sandwich, Papi.

1:00:57.321 --> 1:00:59.223
I-I know you gotta be starving.

1:01:04.928 --> 1:01:07.297
So, what did you see in the bag?

1:01:08.932 --> 1:01:10.434
I wasn't supposed to look in it.

1:01:10.667 --> 1:01:11.668
Remember?

1:01:11.702 --> 1:01:14.304
<i>Mamita,</i> I know you.

1:01:16.840 --> 1:01:19.910
So everyone thinks I'm
the untrustworthy one, right?

1:01:19.943 --> 1:01:22.780
A snitch, Papi?

1:01:22.813 --> 1:01:25.015
You know, that's not fair.
That's fucked up.

1:01:25.049 --> 1:01:28.252
No daughter of mine
is a snitch.

1:01:28.285 --> 1:01:29.453
Don't you ever say that.

1:01:31.722 --> 1:01:33.690
You're always a step ahead,

1:01:33.724 --> 1:01:36.326
and you make sure
we see what's coming.

1:01:36.360 --> 1:01:40.030
Looking in that fucking bag
makes you smart.

1:01:42.032 --> 1:01:44.835
I only read a few pages.

1:01:44.868 --> 1:01:47.004
Papi, they're bank accounts.

1:01:47.037 --> 1:01:51.075
Some are for Zeke, me,
Dru, Cane,

1:01:51.108 --> 1:01:52.242
and Monet.

1:01:57.781 --> 1:01:59.283
Make sure you
and your brothers stay here.

1:01:59.316 --> 1:02:02.953
Don't go out for anything.
I'll be back.

1:02:12.029 --> 1:02:14.098
Yeah, the penthouse.
They expecting me.

1:02:29.113 --> 1:02:30.380
Right on time, Tariq.

1:02:31.915 --> 1:02:33.117
Let him up.

1:02:34.918 --> 1:02:36.954
<i>Let him up and step aside.</i>

1:02:39.857 --> 1:02:41.024
It's over, Mecca.

1:02:48.999 --> 1:02:50.767
You betrayed me, Nae-Nae.

1:02:50.801 --> 1:02:52.469
But I am not pointing
a gun at you.

1:02:52.503 --> 1:02:56.039
Me? You fucking ruined my life.

1:02:56.073 --> 1:02:58.876
You ruined Zeke's life.
You shot at us, and you lied.

1:02:58.909 --> 1:03:01.311
How is that any different
than what you did?

1:03:01.345 --> 1:03:05.115
You stole my product, hmm,
and you lied about it.

1:03:06.283 --> 1:03:08.018
Nae-Nae, we are perfect
for each other.

1:03:08.051 --> 1:03:10.087
<i>Don't you fucking move.
Don't you come any further.</i>

1:03:10.120 --> 1:03:12.990
<i>I will do whatever
it takes to have you, Nae-Nae.</i>

1:03:14.091 --> 1:03:15.292
Zeke already hates you.

1:03:15.325 --> 1:03:17.961
You killed his girlfriend, Carrie,
and you lied about it, right?

1:03:17.995 --> 1:03:19.296
Because you love him.

1:03:45.889 --> 1:03:47.157
Mecca.

1:03:48.825 --> 1:03:50.494
No passenger.

1:03:51.428 --> 1:03:52.996
I love you.

1:03:54.064 --> 1:03:55.532
I have only ever loved you.

1:03:57.234 --> 1:03:59.203
But if you do this to Zeke,
you kill his father,

1:03:59.236 --> 1:04:02.439
he's gonna hate you
for the rest of his life.

1:04:04.174 --> 1:04:07.244
You ain't getting away, Mecca.

1:04:10.847 --> 1:04:13.417
Where the fuck you think
you're going, motherfucker?

1:04:17.054 --> 1:04:19.923
Oh, my God. Hey. Hey!

1:04:22.960 --> 1:04:24.928
Fuck you.

1:04:24.962 --> 1:04:26.196
Zeke will get over it.

1:04:39.376 --> 1:04:41.511

You got this nigga?

1:04:41.545 --> 1:04:43.213
Mecca figured that shit out.

1:04:43.247 --> 1:04:44.948
He was gonna shoot you
soon as the doors came open,

1:04:44.982 --> 1:04:46.149
then turn around and kill me.

1:04:46.183 --> 1:04:49.019
- I had no choice.
- Fuck.

1:04:49.052 --> 1:04:50.387
A'ight, we gotta clear
these cameras.

1:04:50.420 --> 1:04:52.155
- Effie showed me how.
- <i>Wait, hold on, Tariq.</i>

1:04:53.323 --> 1:04:56.260
Look, you kept your word to me,
so now I'ma keep my word to you.

1:04:56.293 --> 1:04:58.161
If you want out the game,
I won't stop you.

1:05:00.163 --> 1:05:02.032
Well, I'm not about to get
my money from this nigga,

1:05:02.065 --> 1:05:03.634

so...

1:05:03.667 --> 1:05:05.369

1:05:46.243 --> 1:05:48.245
Yeah, Ma, we good.

1:05:56.186 --> 1:05:57.187
You're here.

1:05:57.220 --> 1:05:59.456
Of course I am.
Just like I said.

1:06:00.457 --> 1:06:02.492
Ma, Papi, come look at this.

1:06:11.301 --> 1:06:12.703

<i>Breaking news
that Dante Spears,</i>

1:06:14.671 --> 1:06:17.207
international businessman,
was found shot dead

1:06:17.240 --> 1:06:19.509
at his penthouse
earlier this evening.

1:06:19.543 --> 1:06:22.512
The NYPD is working
with the DEA and FBI,

1:06:22.546 --> 1:06:24.414
who have no leads at this time.

1:06:24.448 --> 1:06:26.550

1:06:32.022 --> 1:06:33.156
You did it, Ma.

1:06:35.225 --> 1:06:37.260
Anybody hear from Zeke?

1:06:37.294 --> 1:06:39.296
- No.
- I haven't.

1:07:01.785 --> 1:07:04.688
You called me
a little late, Dante.

1:07:04.721 --> 1:07:06.156
<i>Agent Rodriguez?</i>

1:07:07.224 --> 1:07:09.526
My condolences on your CI.

1:07:09.559 --> 1:07:11.061
I'm still interviewing
the doorman,

1:07:11.094 --> 1:07:12.696
but he doesn't remember
anyone suspicious.

1:07:12.729 --> 1:07:15.399
That's convenient.
And the cameras?

1:07:15.432 --> 1:07:17.701
The-the system seems
pretty high-tech.

1:07:17.734 --> 1:07:19.636
Wiped. All of them.

1:07:19.669 --> 1:07:21.505
We recovered stills
from a long shot in the lobby,

1:07:21.538 --> 1:07:23.473
but it's pretty grainy.

1:07:31.148 --> 1:07:32.482
Thanks, Detective.

1:07:45.128 --> 1:07:47.130
Tariq St. Patrick.

1:07:48.632 --> 1:07:51.334
We meet again.

White boy hasn't found
anything yet,

1:07:58.475 --> 1:08:00.544
but we're still working on it.

1:08:02.279 --> 1:08:04.347
Davis, I talked to the doctor,

1:08:04.381 --> 1:08:07.484
and, uh, the news isn't good,
little bro.

1:08:08.752 --> 1:08:12.355
Little brother? Shit.

1:08:13.523 --> 1:08:14.858
I'm at least...

1:08:17.260 --> 1:08:19.796
...four inches taller than you,
motherfucker.

1:08:19.830 --> 1:08:21.431
And you gonna joke
while I'm trying to--

1:08:22.532 --> 1:08:24.134
Look.

1:08:24.167 --> 1:08:27.170
Don't go pushing that white boy
too hard, a'ight?

1:08:27.204 --> 1:08:30.207

than have you take my place.

<i>We do whatever it takes

1:08:35.779 --> 1:08:39.249
I think Davis is working
as the Tejadas' consigliere.

1:08:40.584 --> 1:08:44.654
If it means getting justice
for Lauren and Carrie...

1:08:44.688 --> 1:08:45.822
I'll help you.

1:08:48.158 --> 1:08:50.460

1:08:53.396 --> 1:08:56.233
It's-it's not
about my law license.

1:08:56.266 --> 1:08:58.368
It's about my life.

1:08:58.401 --> 1:09:01.705
