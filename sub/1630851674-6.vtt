12:53.554 --> 12:55.687
the warlord in the photo
with Mandy?

12:55.730 --> 12:57.688
Prior to being snatched up
by SGS,

12:57.732 --> 13:00.214
he was a player in regional
arms smuggling.

13:00.256 --> 13:03.173
He commandeered a couple
of small gold mines.

13:03.216 --> 13:04.870
You're telling me a guy
that's dressed up

13:04.913 --> 13:08.525
like an extra from the Predator
owns a bunch of gold mines?

13:08.570 --> 13:10.572
DAVIS: It's a plentiful
resource in the area.

13:10.615 --> 13:12.703
It's often used to support
illicit activities

13:12.748 --> 13:15.576
like arms sales
and money laundering.

13:15.620 --> 13:17.621
That explains why SGS is
keeping him prisoner

13:17.666 --> 13:20.059
instead of executing him
when they swept through.

13:20.102 --> 13:23.279
Force him to run the mines,
adds to their war chest.

13:23.323 --> 13:25.239
And the fact that they kept
Mandy captive, too,

13:25.282 --> 13:26.630
means she has value to them.

13:26.674 --> 13:28.197
Some reason to keep her alive.

13:28.241 --> 13:30.331
DAVIS:
Mandy's smart.

13:30.374 --> 13:31.811
She knows how to
make herself useful.

13:31.854 --> 13:33.551
CLAY: You know, if they know
that she's CIA,

13:33.595 --> 13:36.076
they'll want the intel
that she can offer.

13:36.119 --> 13:38.251
I don't see Mandy
giving that up.

13:38.294 --> 13:40.601
She was trained for that.

13:40.644 --> 13:42.385
She knows how to walk that line.

13:42.429 --> 13:44.605
Give 'em just enough,
buy herself another day.

13:44.649 --> 13:46.956
Protecting the Agency when
no one's lifting a finger

13:47.000 --> 13:48.870
to help her.

13:48.914 --> 13:51.394
Well, let's see where we get
with these cell phone IPs.

13:58.576 --> 14:00.796
Yo. Hey.

14:00.840 --> 14:03.277
Held my questions long enough.
You need to fill me in.

14:03.320 --> 14:04.668
You heard Davis. We're nowhere.

14:04.712 --> 14:06.846
Let me guess,
Boukare wasn't talking. Huh?

14:06.889 --> 14:09.979
So you took a gamble
on the other Tango.

14:10.023 --> 14:11.284
Gave him a chance to escape.

14:11.327 --> 14:13.634
Used a crash grenade?
He squirts,

14:13.677 --> 14:15.636
you have Davis track his
cell phone in the hopes that

14:15.679 --> 14:17.378
he contacts Sankara's captors.

14:17.421 --> 14:19.946
Lets them know some
angry Americans are

14:19.989 --> 14:23.210
hunting down their prisoner.
You get real lucky,

14:23.253 --> 14:24.254
that might give you
his location,

14:24.298 --> 14:25.865
which also might be Mandy's.

14:31.347 --> 14:33.741
[sniffs] Had to put
a show on for Remington.

14:33.784 --> 14:36.658
Yeah, and leave me watching
from the cheap seats again.

14:36.701 --> 14:38.268
There's way too many eyes
on you right now.

14:38.312 --> 14:39.835
I don't need you getting
caught up in all this.

14:39.879 --> 14:41.053
So you knew it was reckless
and you did it anyway.

14:41.096 --> 14:42.142
Look, I had to do something,
okay, Ray?

14:42.184 --> 14:43.011
That something could
get us kicked

14:43.056 --> 14:44.578
from the Teams, Jace.

14:44.621 --> 14:47.538
Letting a terrorist loose
on some desperate long shot?

14:47.581 --> 14:50.498
A long shot is all I had, Ray.

14:51.542 --> 14:54.719
We're all messed-up
over Mandy, man.

14:54.763 --> 14:56.330
And knowing what
she's going through,

14:56.373 --> 14:58.722
I would give anything
to rescue her from

14:58.767 --> 15:01.378
the pain and sorrow
she's feeling, but...

15:01.422 --> 15:02.770
doesn't mean we get stupid,
Jason.

15:02.813 --> 15:04.642
Look, I had to make a call,
okay?

15:04.686 --> 15:06.905
-You weren't there.
-Yeah, because you sent me off.

15:06.948 --> 15:08.168
We gonna do this again?

15:08.211 --> 15:09.778
Are we really gonna
do this again?! Stop.

15:09.821 --> 15:13.042
You understand me?
Mandy needs our help. Right?

15:13.086 --> 15:16.350
I am not gonna sit back
and do nothing about that.

15:16.393 --> 15:17.741
She needs someone
to fight for her.

15:17.786 --> 15:19.961
I'm gonna fight for her.
Got it?

15:37.631 --> 15:40.982
Need to talk about what happened
on target last night.

15:41.027 --> 15:43.463
Bagged an HVT we missed
three times before.

15:43.506 --> 15:45.205
Enjoy the victory.

15:45.248 --> 15:46.770
You telling me you don't have
any concerns about

15:46.815 --> 15:48.337
the terrorist Jason let go?

15:48.381 --> 15:50.340
That shitbird was a nobody.

15:50.384 --> 15:51.514
All right?
Boukare was a dead end.

15:51.558 --> 15:52.995
We needed a clear path to Mandy.

15:53.038 --> 15:55.084
Look, I know why the decision
was made, Clay.

15:55.128 --> 15:56.476
It doesn't make it a good one.

15:59.567 --> 16:03.004
Look, with-with Jason leaning
on you more now,

16:03.048 --> 16:04.485
it means it's your
responsibility

16:04.528 --> 16:06.052
to talk him out of
his bad ideas.

16:07.879 --> 16:09.576
You mad because
Jason went rogue,

16:09.620 --> 16:10.926
or that he did it without you?

16:10.970 --> 16:12.318
I'm mad because my team
is acting like

16:12.361 --> 16:13.450
a bunch of roided-up
Neanderthals

16:13.494 --> 16:15.017
not using their heads.

16:15.061 --> 16:17.932
You worried about a personal
blowback from Command?

16:17.976 --> 16:19.803
What the hell does Command
have to do with anything?

16:19.847 --> 16:22.981
Well, your track record as OIC

16:23.024 --> 16:24.634
isn't the cleanest.

16:24.678 --> 16:26.681
My track record has
nothing to do

16:26.724 --> 16:29.857
with you and Jason's
sloppy work.

16:29.900 --> 16:34.341
What you call sloppy, okay,
I call a calculated risk.

16:35.471 --> 16:38.213
[laughs softly]
It was your idea.

16:38.258 --> 16:40.825
Look, Jason was desperate, and
this was the least bad option.

16:40.869 --> 16:42.479
And if it fails,
he's more desperate.

16:42.523 --> 16:44.654
What's your plan then?

16:45.917 --> 16:48.789
Hmm. If you are gonna be
his right hand,

16:48.832 --> 16:50.835
you have got to anticipate
every single...

16:50.879 --> 16:52.576
Look, I know all about
looking out for Bravo 1,

16:52.620 --> 16:54.013
all right, Ray?

16:54.056 --> 16:55.491
I've been watching him
like a hawk

16:55.536 --> 16:56.841
since we got home
from last deployment,

16:56.884 --> 16:59.669
-and you weren't around.
-Why is that?

16:59.713 --> 17:00.932
Because 20 years of combat

17:00.975 --> 17:02.673
is eventually gonna catch up
with him.

17:02.716 --> 17:04.066
I just want to make sure
we can clock it

17:04.109 --> 17:06.721
before it's too late.

17:06.763 --> 17:08.766
You think he's falling off?

17:11.073 --> 17:14.119
Just... with everything
that happened,

17:14.163 --> 17:16.512
I... I just felt like you
could use an extra hand

17:16.557 --> 17:18.558
watching Jason's six.

17:20.343 --> 17:23.912
Yeah, well, Bravo couldn't ask
for a better hall monitor.

17:31.310 --> 17:33.922
[door opens, slams]

17:33.964 --> 17:36.229
Okay.

17:36.271 --> 17:37.925
Anything on the squirter?

17:37.969 --> 17:40.058
Looks like he
turned off his cell.

17:40.102 --> 17:41.711
Can't you use the Stingray?
Put that on

17:41.756 --> 17:43.105
and see if you can ping
his location?

17:43.148 --> 17:45.325
Anything to get us off
our asses here. Come on.

17:45.367 --> 17:48.067
Look, we alert him to
our control over his device,

17:48.109 --> 17:50.721
he sends word and shuts
the whole network down.

17:50.765 --> 17:53.159
Patience is our ally right now.

17:53.201 --> 17:56.204
Yeah, right, and time
is in short supply, right?

17:56.249 --> 17:57.641
Mandy is tough.

17:57.684 --> 17:59.512
Whatever they throw at her,
she can handle.

17:59.556 --> 18:00.688
Yeah, she's tough.

18:00.730 --> 18:01.950
Let's just hope that
she's still alive,

18:01.992 --> 18:03.385
'cause we both know
the longer this goes on,

18:03.430 --> 18:05.387
that's not good for the person
who's in captivity.

18:05.432 --> 18:07.825
The squirter is going to
turn on his cell sooner

18:07.868 --> 18:10.132
rather than later.

18:10.175 --> 18:13.221
This will work.

18:13.266 --> 18:15.833
Let me know when he does.

18:26.974 --> 18:28.628
[buzzing]

18:28.672 --> 18:31.021
-[Leanne laughing]
-Yo, you got a minute?

18:31.066 --> 18:34.113
Yeah, my baby girl's only
a few months old,

18:34.155 --> 18:38.290
and it is pure hell
being away from her.

18:38.334 --> 18:41.031
Got any secrets
how to get through this?

18:42.643 --> 18:45.427
All that missing is what makes
going home so great.

18:45.471 --> 18:48.387
Yeah, that's if home
and the kid

18:48.431 --> 18:49.911
are in the same place.

18:49.953 --> 18:51.520
Leaves me screwed.

18:51.565 --> 18:54.959
You know, we can use a satellite
to guide a missile

18:55.002 --> 18:56.613
to a toad's ass wart,

18:56.656 --> 18:59.834
and I can't get a damn signal.

19:02.183 --> 19:05.099
You need me for something?

19:05.144 --> 19:08.582
Yeah, um... last night,

19:08.625 --> 19:10.800
on the op, with the squirter.

19:10.845 --> 19:13.326
What'd you think of all that?

19:13.368 --> 19:15.196
Well, Clay's plan fit the bill,

19:15.240 --> 19:17.590
and Jason saw that. Why?

19:17.634 --> 19:19.896
I just noticed Jason's
relying on Clay a lot.

19:19.941 --> 19:21.769
I'm not-not saying Clay
can't handle it.

19:21.811 --> 19:24.205
I just want to make sure
his ambition,

19:24.250 --> 19:26.251
along with Jason's rage,

19:26.295 --> 19:28.210
doesn't put us in the middle
of a shit sandwich.

19:28.253 --> 19:29.471
Lord knows I've had my issues

19:29.516 --> 19:30.994
with Clay's ambition
in the past,

19:31.038 --> 19:34.520
but I don't doubt
that his head's right

19:34.564 --> 19:37.698
when it comes
to the team anymore.

19:37.740 --> 19:40.569
He took a bullet for me
on the Marsden letter.

19:42.136 --> 19:44.748
-Maybe he's thinking
better of it now.
-What you talking about?

19:44.791 --> 19:49.362
Someone tipped Command
to my behavior on deployment.

19:49.404 --> 19:50.927
Someone ratted on you?

19:50.971 --> 19:52.494
That's not the word I'd use.

19:52.538 --> 19:54.584
I practically invited
the team to do it.

19:54.627 --> 19:57.107
Yeah, but not behind
your back like this.

19:57.152 --> 20:00.634
And nobody would do you dirty
on Bravo like that.

20:00.676 --> 20:02.026
Especially not Clay.

20:02.069 --> 20:05.464
You know, this isn't easy
for me neither.

20:05.508 --> 20:07.944
You know, having Bravo 1 and 6

20:07.989 --> 20:10.296
finish each other's
sentences.

20:10.338 --> 20:12.776
I mean, I thought Stella was
my only competition

20:12.819 --> 20:16.171
competing for Clay's other half.

20:17.999 --> 20:20.653
But you and Jace, you--
you have that.

20:20.696 --> 20:22.263
For much longer.

20:22.307 --> 20:25.310
So I wouldn't... I wouldn't
beat yourself up over this.

20:25.354 --> 20:29.663
You saying I should get used to
the way things are now?

20:29.705 --> 20:32.535
It's not like it's new.

20:32.578 --> 20:35.145
You know,
when you were in captivity,

20:35.190 --> 20:38.061
Jason turned to the next man,
and Clay stepped up.

20:38.105 --> 20:41.631
He filled in for you
as Jiminy Cricket,

20:41.674 --> 20:43.807
and he kept J from
crossing a line

20:43.851 --> 20:45.417
that he couldn't uncross.

20:45.461 --> 20:48.724
Clay was in J's ear that day,

20:48.769 --> 20:51.250
and kept him from
tanking his career.

20:55.165 --> 20:57.907
Clay had his back
when I couldn't.

20:58.692 --> 21:01.259
I guess he's earned
Jason's trust.

21:01.303 --> 21:03.086
I tell you what.

21:03.131 --> 21:05.960
Change can sting like
a honeybee on cocaine,

21:06.002 --> 21:10.616
but I don't see
what other choice you have.

21:19.886 --> 21:23.064
All right. Okey doke.

21:23.106 --> 21:24.847
Get some rest, all right?
Love you.

21:24.892 --> 21:26.414
SONNY:
Are you kidding me?

21:26.459 --> 21:28.808
Not one person
up here right now

21:28.852 --> 21:30.027
can get a signal
to save their ass,

21:30.070 --> 21:34.554
and Blondie 5-G here
is calling home.

21:35.684 --> 21:37.425
You want to use
my connection?

21:37.470 --> 21:40.037
No, no. My-my window passed.

21:40.080 --> 21:41.691
I just wanted to check in
and see

21:41.734 --> 21:44.346
how, uh, the "Mommy and Me"
music class went.

21:44.390 --> 21:46.086
[scoffs]

21:46.130 --> 21:48.045
I'm impressed by
how dialed in you are.

21:48.088 --> 21:50.308
Well, I sense surprise
in your voice.

21:50.352 --> 21:53.311
Just, uh, you know,
thinking back to your reaction

21:53.355 --> 21:55.009
when you first heard
that Hannah was pregnant.

21:55.051 --> 21:57.532
Oh, yeah, I was sweating
like a germophobe

21:57.576 --> 21:59.099
in a public toilet.

21:59.143 --> 22:02.058
-But you kept operating
like normal.
-Yeah.

22:02.103 --> 22:05.061
Yeah, I guess I was just
more concerned

22:05.105 --> 22:06.586
about how I was gonna
tell Davis,

22:06.628 --> 22:09.806
and what business did I have

22:09.849 --> 22:11.894
being a father
in the first place?

22:11.939 --> 22:13.375
What about now?

22:13.419 --> 22:16.900
Now, uh, now I just
keep thinking about

22:16.943 --> 22:19.207
how this job could
take me away from Leanne,

22:19.250 --> 22:21.817
and how that would
unleash a flood

22:21.862 --> 22:24.298
of biblical proportion.

22:25.169 --> 22:26.779
What's up with the inquisition?

22:26.823 --> 22:29.608
[exhales sharply]

22:31.306 --> 22:32.873
Stella's pregnant.

22:32.915 --> 22:35.483
What? You serious?

22:35.528 --> 22:36.789
My man, look at you.

22:36.833 --> 22:39.009
You got some strong
swimmers there.

22:39.052 --> 22:41.316
[laughs]
I knew you could do it.

22:41.359 --> 22:43.186
Why'd it take you
so long to tell me?

22:43.230 --> 22:46.538
Aw, it's just, uh,
it's still early.

22:47.626 --> 22:49.890
I didn't want to be
insensitive to your situation.

22:49.932 --> 22:53.284
[laughs] Insensitive
to my situation. What?

22:53.327 --> 22:55.590
What, you don't think
I could handle the fact

22:55.634 --> 22:57.723
that your life is
Norman Blondewell,

22:57.767 --> 23:00.248
and I'm the After School
Special?

23:00.290 --> 23:03.337
-Is that it?
-That's not what I meant.

23:30.451 --> 23:32.453

-Yep.

23:32.498 --> 23:34.107
Good work bringing Boukare in.

23:34.151 --> 23:37.327
Well, Bravo's all about
mission success.

23:37.372 --> 23:39.853
I'm just happy that
we're here to assist.

23:39.895 --> 23:41.984
Well, even a Master
of the Universe can

23:42.028 --> 23:43.377
admit when he's wrong.

23:43.422 --> 23:45.641
All right, so, being
the Master of the Universe,

23:45.684 --> 23:47.295
where do we stand
with Mandy Ellis?

23:47.337 --> 23:49.297
What are we gonna do about that?

23:49.339 --> 23:51.167
I remember advising you
on where

23:51.211 --> 23:53.387
the Agency stands
on that front.

23:53.432 --> 23:55.738
But because you brought
Boukare to justice,

23:55.781 --> 23:57.653
I can share that
I've devoted resources

23:57.697 --> 23:59.786
-to looking for her.
-And?

23:59.828 --> 24:01.961
No leads to report.
Unfortunately,

24:02.005 --> 24:03.484
with the manpower shortage,

24:03.528 --> 24:05.051
I can't dig in
as deep as I'd like.

24:05.095 --> 24:08.446
Well, Bravo can help with
the manpower problem.

24:08.490 --> 24:10.099
Sadly, you can't.

24:10.144 --> 24:11.492
Bravo's accomplished
its mission

24:11.537 --> 24:13.016
of cutting the head
off the snake here.

24:13.059 --> 24:15.061
Your work is done.

24:28.857 --> 24:31.121
Hey, Dryden's sending us
back to Vah Beach.

24:31.164 --> 24:33.471
So anything you have, you better
give it to me right now.

24:33.515 --> 24:34.777
I'm working on it.

24:34.820 --> 24:36.431
Squirter finally turned
back on his cell,

24:36.474 --> 24:38.172
pinged one of Sankara's
gold mines.

24:38.214 --> 24:40.869
Okay, so that's probably where
they're holding Sankara.

24:40.913 --> 24:42.045
You got any intel
oh his phone?

24:42.088 --> 24:44.221
Nothing that connects
to Mandy.

24:44.265 --> 24:45.875
[exhales sharply]

24:45.919 --> 24:47.355
Then we go get this guy Sankara.

24:47.397 --> 24:49.226
We rescue him
and ask him questions.

24:49.269 --> 24:50.531
Sankara means nothing
to Dryden.

24:50.576 --> 24:51.881
He's not gonna authorize
the op.

24:51.924 --> 24:52.969
Don't you understand?
This is the only thread

24:53.012 --> 24:54.404
that we have;
we gotta follow it.

24:54.449 --> 24:56.406
Look, I can count
my close hands on one hand.

24:56.451 --> 24:57.844
I don't want to lose
Mandy either.

24:57.886 --> 24:59.976
Besides, looking for her,
it kind of helps

25:00.019 --> 25:02.195
quiet all questions.

25:06.721 --> 25:08.419
I actually believed her.

25:08.462 --> 25:10.900
Believed her when she told me
she was leaving the Agency.

25:10.943 --> 25:12.554
It's kind of hard to swallow,
thinking all this

25:12.597 --> 25:13.990
might be a lie.

25:14.034 --> 25:16.644
I mean, have all the postcards
that she sent me

25:16.689 --> 25:19.952
from surf retreats been
part of her cover story?

25:21.084 --> 25:24.218
I can't even be sure that
our friendship was real.

25:27.916 --> 25:29.440
None of that matters, though.

25:29.483 --> 25:31.442
-Not when she's in danger.
-Yeah, she's in danger.

25:31.486 --> 25:34.054
And we have to do everything
we can in order to save her.

25:34.096 --> 25:36.622
And the gold mine,
that's our best lead.

25:36.664 --> 25:39.363
It is our only lead.
That doesn't make it a good one.

25:39.406 --> 25:41.974
Look, I'm on a plane
in 12 hours, you got it?

25:42.018 --> 25:44.586
You have to pull a rabbit
out of your hat here,

25:44.630 --> 25:46.500
like you did for Ray in Tunisia.

25:47.720 --> 25:50.461
If there's any way to make
this gold mine a target

25:50.505 --> 25:54.290
that Dryden will approve...
I'll find it.

26:08.174 --> 26:11.178
-Hey.
-Oh, you got it up there, huh?

26:11.221 --> 26:12.266
Oh, yeah.

26:16.530 --> 26:18.968
Hate leaving with
unfinished business.

26:19.011 --> 26:20.622
You weren't in the barracks
all night.

26:20.665 --> 26:22.798
Making any headway on Mandy?

26:22.842 --> 26:24.538
No.

26:25.758 --> 26:28.325
Hmm-mm. Nothing.

26:28.368 --> 26:30.066
I can't even bring
myself to pack.

26:30.109 --> 26:32.415
Even though Dryden's put up

26:32.460 --> 26:35.244
the, uh,
"mission accomplished" banner.

26:35.288 --> 26:38.640
At least it clarifies
what the real mission was.

26:38.683 --> 26:40.555
You know, less about catching
bad guys and more about

26:40.598 --> 26:42.164
securing a foothold
here in Africa

26:42.209 --> 26:44.079
to compete with China
and Russia.

26:44.124 --> 26:45.994
Hate thinking Mandy's
paying the ultimate price

26:46.038 --> 26:47.431
for nothing more than
a land grab.

26:47.474 --> 26:49.172
Oh, that's more than
a land grab.

26:49.215 --> 26:52.653
Clearing out SGS,
that's just the start.

26:52.698 --> 26:56.788
Afghanistan 2.0. Right?

26:56.832 --> 27:01.183
Look, Jace, I, uh...

27:01.228 --> 27:03.359
I know how much
you want to find her.

27:03.403 --> 27:05.188
I didn't mean to add
more weight to your shoulders

27:05.231 --> 27:07.538
by complaining about the team's
new dynamics.

27:08.757 --> 27:12.194
It's just gotta suck knowing
that, uh, one of our brothers

27:12.239 --> 27:14.153
dropped a dime on you
to Command.

27:17.679 --> 27:19.942
Thought I was solid.

27:19.986 --> 27:21.422
Maybe they were right
for speaking up.

27:21.464 --> 27:25.034
You're solid, bro.
You're good, you're solid.

27:25.077 --> 27:27.689
You know,
I-I value Clay's input.

27:27.732 --> 27:31.387
As much as I hate to admit it,
he's our best shooter right now.

27:31.432 --> 27:33.390
I just want to do
my part for Bravo.

27:33.433 --> 27:37.046
Yeah. It's why you became
a frogman.

27:37.089 --> 27:38.656
That's why you can't
sit on your ass

27:38.700 --> 27:41.442
knowing Mandy's out there.

27:44.792 --> 27:48.275
Hey! I think
I got something.

27:53.759 --> 27:56.718
Okay, so, I have been
trying to figure out

27:56.761 --> 27:59.460
where SGS has been manufacturing
their explosives.

27:59.502 --> 28:01.854
Based on the S-vests
we recovered from the train,

28:01.896 --> 28:04.247
several chemicals were used.

28:05.944 --> 28:08.556
But the propellant agent
stood out to me:

28:08.598 --> 28:09.904
the diesel fuel.

28:09.949 --> 28:11.124
Diesel's common in HME.

28:11.166 --> 28:12.951
Correct.
But I was able to identify

28:12.994 --> 28:17.130
the specific brand of diesel:
Confederated Petroleum.

28:17.173 --> 28:20.220
I tracked the supply chain
of large-scale deliveries

28:20.262 --> 28:24.267
of Confederated diesel
to this local gold mine.

28:24.310 --> 28:26.704
Well, the diesel was purchased
in bulk, along with other

28:26.748 --> 28:28.750
chemicals commonly used
in mining.

28:28.794 --> 28:30.751
That's why it didn't
raise any flags at the border.

28:30.796 --> 28:33.058
DAVIS:
Exactly. And I wouldn't have
caught it either except

28:33.102 --> 28:34.756
I discovered that
even though this mine

28:34.799 --> 28:36.365
has been defunct for months,

28:36.410 --> 28:38.717
the Confederated shipments
continued.

28:38.759 --> 28:40.457
So SGS is using the diesel
in the mine

28:40.500 --> 28:41.632
to assemble their weapons.

28:41.675 --> 28:42.981
And if you dismantle
this facility,

28:43.025 --> 28:45.548
it's gonna give you
a foothold in the region

28:45.593 --> 28:48.290
that you've been
trying to control.

28:50.641 --> 28:52.861
I agree.

28:52.904 --> 28:55.690
Does this target have anything
to do with Mandy Ellis?

28:57.257 --> 28:59.259
It's not enough that
SGS weapons get destroyed,

28:59.301 --> 29:01.347
and the U.S. recovers the mine
instead of Russia or China?

29:01.391 --> 29:03.523
Sounds like a win-win to me.

29:12.924 --> 29:14.361
Approved.

29:18.365 --> 29:21.715
This gold mine utilizes trenches
rather than caves,

29:21.759 --> 29:24.674
so explosives assembly
isn't underground.

29:24.719 --> 29:26.721
It makes clearing
the area easier.

29:26.765 --> 29:28.722
Be easier just
to level the whole thing.

29:28.767 --> 29:31.813
Except we're not just
taking out the explosives.

29:33.858 --> 29:36.338
IMAGEINT shows diesel deliveries
are being moved

29:36.383 --> 29:38.689
into these Conex boxes.

29:42.432 --> 29:44.173
Bet this is the assembly site.

29:44.217 --> 29:45.826
How many Tangos on target?

29:45.871 --> 29:49.221
Pings confirm there are five
cell phones currently on-site.

29:49.265 --> 29:51.354
Could be more Tangos there,
but it won't be an army.

29:51.397 --> 29:53.748
Based on a conversation
I recorded through the Stingray,

29:53.791 --> 29:55.270
they're only running
a skeleton crew

29:55.315 --> 29:56.316
since we took down the train.

29:56.358 --> 29:58.099
Our first order of business

29:58.144 --> 30:00.015
will be dismantling
the weapons facility.

30:00.058 --> 30:01.407
Then we move on

30:01.451 --> 30:04.237

30:06.281 --> 30:08.762
Hoping Mandy's still there
with him.

30:08.807 --> 30:10.199
We do not have confirmation

30:10.242 --> 30:11.896
there are any prisoners
on target.

30:11.940 --> 30:14.376

who worked with Sankara.

37:05.918 --> 37:09.269
I helped him move arms
up through North Africa

37:09.313 --> 37:10.532
and into Europe.

37:10.576 --> 37:13.099
He had a younger sister.

37:13.143 --> 37:16.538
She was my asset, but...

37:16.581 --> 37:18.583
[sighs] We got close.

37:18.626 --> 37:20.237
So...

37:20.280 --> 37:22.456
when I learned
she was in trouble...

37:22.501 --> 37:23.980
It was personal.

37:25.242 --> 37:26.983
She always did right by me.

37:28.681 --> 37:30.769
My conscience wouldn't let me
leave it alone.

37:30.813 --> 37:32.161
What kind of trouble?

37:32.206 --> 37:35.077
Her brother was going
to kill her

37:35.121 --> 37:37.777
if she didn't marry
one of his foot soldiers

37:37.820 --> 37:40.648
and pledge her allegiance
to the family.

37:42.347 --> 37:44.130
And you chose to help.

37:44.173 --> 37:46.175
There was no choice.

37:48.266 --> 37:51.356
After all the assets I burned
when I was in, I thought maybe

37:51.398 --> 37:53.182
this would help balance
the scales a little.

37:53.226 --> 37:55.489
But if you were
under official cover,

37:55.534 --> 37:57.884
why'd the CIA disavow you?

37:57.927 --> 37:59.755
MANDY: I was allowed
to reactivate my cover,

37:59.798 --> 38:04.019
but the Agency wouldn't
fully sanction the mission.

38:04.063 --> 38:06.980
Said it was too hot
in the region

38:07.023 --> 38:08.721
for such a "low priority."

38:08.764 --> 38:13.639
Basically, I was on my own
once I was in-country.

38:13.681 --> 38:15.858
But you went anyway.

38:16.684 --> 38:19.253
I take no for an answer
about as well as you do.

38:20.994 --> 38:24.389
I managed to get her out,
I just...

38:24.431 --> 38:26.434
My exit got stalled

38:26.478 --> 38:28.871
when SGS wrapped up her brother.

38:28.914 --> 38:31.612
Do we even want to know
how you survived?

38:31.657 --> 38:34.007
Well, I am--

38:34.050 --> 38:35.835
I waspretty good at my job.

38:35.878 --> 38:38.489
So I proved my worth
by sharing my knowledge

38:38.532 --> 38:40.927
of Sankara's trade routes.

38:41.927 --> 38:45.018
So you showed you were
more valuable than him.

38:45.061 --> 38:46.541
[scoffs]

38:46.585 --> 38:48.717
I sold him out to save my ass.

38:50.197 --> 38:53.242
Karma's a bitch-- he had it
coming one way or another.

38:53.286 --> 38:55.027
You spooks

38:55.070 --> 38:57.509
sure know how to spin that yarn,
don't you?

38:57.552 --> 38:58.639
I'll give you that.

38:58.684 --> 39:00.554
[scoffs]

39:03.644 --> 39:05.994
It's the truth. I swear.

39:07.300 --> 39:09.172
All of it.

39:20.619 --> 39:22.228
[helicopter whirring]

39:22.271 --> 39:24.579
[indistinct chatter]

39:24.623 --> 39:26.233
I have to commend you,
Master Chief.

39:26.275 --> 39:28.322
Your team's work here
was incredibly fruitful.

39:28.365 --> 39:30.193
Yeah, well, that's...
Tell you what,

39:30.237 --> 39:31.891
I'm just glad that we were able
to move the pieces

39:31.934 --> 39:33.588
around the chessboard for you.

39:33.632 --> 39:35.851
The foothold
you've helped establish

39:35.894 --> 39:37.853
extends the blast radius
in the region.

39:37.896 --> 39:40.681
Pay dividends
for years to come.

39:40.726 --> 39:44.903
Well, victories in this, uh, war

39:44.947 --> 39:47.820
are getting harder to come by,
that's for sure.

39:47.862 --> 39:49.735
But I'll savor this one.

39:51.476 --> 39:53.391
Well, as Chief of Station,

39:53.434 --> 39:56.610
I look forward to
Bravo's next rotation through.

39:56.655 --> 39:58.047
That's right.

39:58.090 --> 40:01.094
No operational malpractices.

40:01.137 --> 40:02.835
-Maybe a little bit.
-[chuckles]

40:02.878 --> 40:05.793
SONNY:
All right, listen,
next time you miss

40:05.838 --> 40:08.753
hanging out with us,
just swing by Vah Beach

40:08.797 --> 40:10.146
so we don't got
to run through this again.

40:10.190 --> 40:12.148
-You can count on it.
-All right. Be good.

40:13.715 --> 40:16.588
You sure you don't want to fly
back with us like old times?

40:16.630 --> 40:19.329
Gotta jump through
some CIA hoops

40:19.373 --> 40:21.070
before they'll let me leave.

40:21.114 --> 40:24.246
Yeah. Take care.

40:25.945 --> 40:28.599
Drinks at the Bulkhead
whenever you're ready.

40:28.643 --> 40:30.297
Yeah.

40:35.128 --> 40:38.043
I hear he's pleased
you delivered him a gold mine.

40:38.086 --> 40:40.438
Well, SGS took it
from the Warlord

40:40.481 --> 40:41.612
who took it from locals

40:41.655 --> 40:43.179
who took it
from Burkina Faso, so...

40:43.222 --> 40:45.355
It really should go back
to the state.

40:45.398 --> 40:46.487
[sighs]

40:46.530 --> 40:48.054
Same as 20 years ago
in Afghanistan.

40:48.097 --> 40:50.925
CIA comes in, stirs the pot,
lets the chips fall.

40:50.969 --> 40:52.536
Mm-hmm.

40:52.579 --> 40:55.277
Well, good luck
on your debrief.

40:55.322 --> 40:57.018
[clears throat]

41:03.590 --> 41:07.202
I think you may be taking
this "man of few words" thing

41:07.246 --> 41:08.248
a little far.

41:08.291 --> 41:10.684
I'm just happy you're safe.

41:10.728 --> 41:12.469
Really?

41:16.690 --> 41:19.606
Look, Sonny's right.

41:19.650 --> 41:21.869
I am a professional liar.

41:21.914 --> 41:24.438
But I have never lied to you.

41:24.481 --> 41:26.135
Uh-huh.

41:31.489 --> 41:35.492
I'll... I'll let you know
when I'm back stateside.

41:37.885 --> 41:40.235
Hey, I got stabbed for you,

41:40.280 --> 41:42.150
so none of
this texting bullshit.

41:42.195 --> 41:44.980
I want a phone call.

41:45.023 --> 41:47.547
[laughs softly]

41:47.592 --> 41:49.985
Yeah, I'll call you. I promise.
