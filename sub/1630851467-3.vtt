What's with the sudden rampage?

33:24.600 --> 33:27.320

he's worried Yu-mi would date that guy.

33:27.560 --> 33:29.560

as her rejecting him.

45:57.240 --> 45:58.800
It feels nice to shave it off.

45:58.880 --> 46:01.320
You grew it out for a while.
Why did you shave it all of a sudden?

46:01.520 --> 46:03.080
-Just because.
-Just because?

46:04.120 --> 46:07.200
You once said that a beard
is a sign of a man's pride.

46:07.280 --> 46:08.400
Did I?

46:09.360 --> 46:10.320
I'm going to go.

46:15.920 --> 46:18.480
He shaved because of Kim Yu-mi.

46:18.920 --> 46:19.800
What?

46:19.880 --> 46:22.480
He was so upset
because she didn't text him back,

46:22.560 --> 46:25.120
so I said it was because of his beard.
Then he really shaved it off.

46:25.720 --> 46:27.760
What a fool. Did he get rejected?

46:28.800 --> 46:31.640
If he got rejected, he got rejected.
Why would he shave because of it?

46:31.720 --> 46:33.760
But she texted him back.

46:34.800 --> 46:36.600
I guess he really liked her.

46:41.560 --> 46:47.640
[Yu-mi]

46:41.880 --> 46:44.000
[I had a lot of fun last night too.]

46:44.080 --> 46:47.240
[Get to work safely,
and I hope you have a good day.]

47:03.240 --> 47:08.200
[Goo Woong]

47:03.640 --> 47:05.120
[Oh, I see.]

47:05.200 --> 47:07.920
[I hope you get to work safely too.
Have a nice day!]

47:12.760 --> 47:15.560
[Goo Woong]

47:13.120 --> 47:14.240
[Oh, by the way,]

47:15.640 --> 47:19.120
[Goo Woong]

47:15.920 --> 47:17.240
[I shaved off my beard.]

47:19.200 --> 47:21.120
[I shaved off my beard.]

47:21.720 --> 47:22.760
His beard?

47:27.160 --> 47:30.240
"I shaved off my beard."
What do you think this means?

47:30.480 --> 47:31.680
It's so random.

47:31.760 --> 47:34.120
Who cares if he shaved?
Why would he tell her that?

47:34.200 --> 47:36.680
Why did he shave? I liked his beard.

47:36.760 --> 47:40.760
Guys, do you think that "beard"
is slang for something?

47:40.840 --> 47:41.840
Slang?

47:41.920 --> 47:44.080
I think it means something bad.

47:44.680 --> 47:46.200
I'm nervous.

47:49.640 --> 47:51.360
Yu-mi must have low blood sugar again.

47:51.440 --> 47:54.400
What should we do?
All she did was text him back.

47:54.480 --> 47:56.960
-I can't see anything. I'm scared.
-My gosh.

47:57.040 --> 48:00.200
This won't do. I'll go out and check
to see how things are outside.

48:00.640 --> 48:02.320
Reason, wait for me.

48:04.440 --> 48:05.520
Yu-mi!

48:06.520 --> 48:08.520
Yu-mi, how did your blind date go?

48:09.440 --> 48:10.800
I can't believe it.

48:10.880 --> 48:13.440
You guys looked great together
in the photo.

48:13.840 --> 48:15.720
How did Ugi come up with that idea?

48:17.400 --> 48:18.840
How was it?

48:18.920 --> 48:21.520
Can you tell me? Ruby is curious!

48:27.160 --> 48:28.200
No.

48:28.440 --> 48:31.960
It's a stress minefield!
Everything must be stressing her out!

48:32.320 --> 48:35.320
Are you going to meet with him again?
Did he ask you out on a second date?

48:35.840 --> 48:37.240
Why isn't it coming?

48:37.840 --> 48:39.680
Did he ask you out on a second date?

48:39.760 --> 48:40.920
I don't know.

48:41.160 --> 48:45.000
How could you not know?
Ruby is so curious!

48:45.080 --> 48:47.600
I'm going to take the stairs,
so take your time coming up.

48:49.720 --> 48:51.400
What? Wait...

48:52.920 --> 48:54.960
It's going to take forever
to get to the seventh floor.

48:57.240 --> 48:58.880
Hold on.

48:59.960 --> 49:01.120
Hello.

49:29.520 --> 49:32.960
Are you just getting here?
The elevator came shortly after you left.

49:33.080 --> 49:36.640
Hey, Yu-mi.
I heard your blind date went really well.

49:36.880 --> 49:37.920
Who said that?

49:38.400 --> 49:40.600
Ruby. She said she knows him.

49:40.840 --> 49:42.520
I heard he was really handsome.

49:42.600 --> 49:44.120
He's totally, completely handsome.

49:44.200 --> 49:46.960
-What are you--
-Who's totally, completely handsome?

49:47.480 --> 49:49.040
The guy Ms. Kim went on a blind date with.

49:49.120 --> 49:52.400
Really? You left in such
a hurry yesterday. Did it go well?

49:52.600 --> 49:53.960
It's not that...

49:54.080 --> 49:56.880
Yes, sir. I know him, and he's great.

49:58.720 --> 50:00.040
Gosh.

50:11.320 --> 50:13.440
Ruby. Can you just shut your mouth?

50:13.520 --> 50:15.840
Stop pouring gas on the fire!

50:16.280 --> 50:17.680
She's doing that on purpose, right?

50:17.760 --> 50:19.800
So that everyone finds out
she went on a blind date!

50:19.880 --> 50:23.080
That fool. Does she think that
she could have Ugi then?

50:26.160 --> 50:28.120
These are the documents
for Dongguk Steel Mill Company.

50:28.360 --> 50:29.400
Okay.

50:30.480 --> 50:32.840
Want me to see how compatible
you and Woong are with your names?

50:33.840 --> 50:34.880
What?

50:35.000 --> 50:36.440
Don't you know what that is?

50:37.120 --> 50:40.520
You can write the name of the couple,

50:40.920 --> 50:45.360
[Kim Yu-mi, Goo Woong]

50:44.160 --> 50:45.880
Kim Yu-mi. Goo Woong.

50:46.960 --> 50:49.360
Kim is five.

50:49.440 --> 50:51.160
Goo is...

50:51.480 --> 50:52.680
What are you doing?

50:52.720 --> 50:54.320
[Kim Yu-mi, Goo Woong]

50:54.480 --> 50:56.120
Mi is three.

50:59.960 --> 51:02.440
No way. How is this possible?

51:02.920 --> 51:04.440
It says you're perfect for each other!

51:06.760 --> 51:08.000
-You...
-Ruby?

51:08.720 --> 51:09.920
Can you come here for a second?

51:10.120 --> 51:11.120
Okay.

51:11.360 --> 51:14.840
It says you guys are
a match made in heaven!

51:26.680 --> 51:28.680
At this rate, the entire village
will end up blowing up!

51:28.760 --> 51:30.040
We have to try something!

51:30.160 --> 51:31.960
What can we possibly do?

51:32.080 --> 51:34.880
We don't even know if Love
is dead or alive.

51:37.640 --> 51:41.800
I'm hungry, but I don't want to eat.

51:42.640 --> 51:46.640
Hunger must be dying.

51:47.040 --> 51:49.080
She needs to eat something to gain energy,

51:49.160 --> 51:50.800
but she's not eating anything.

51:51.680 --> 51:53.000
Is there another way?

51:53.080 --> 51:55.200
You know what will happen
if we leave Yu-mi alone like this.

51:55.280 --> 51:56.320
That's...

51:58.440 --> 52:00.840
[There's a deep valley called
the Ravine of Subconscious]

52:00.920 --> 52:02.600
[in everyone's heart.]

52:06.240 --> 52:09.040
[Hysterius lives here all alone,]

52:09.280 --> 52:12.680
I'm almost done collecting all of it.
I'm almost done.

52:12.760 --> 52:16.200
[and he gathers all of Yu-mi's stress
to create weapons.]

52:17.680 --> 52:21.080
[Once it reaches the limit, he comes into
the village and causes a scene.]

52:22.360 --> 52:24.280
I'm going to raze everything
to the ground!

52:26.320 --> 52:31.000
[When Hysterius takes over the village,
this happens.]

52:31.800 --> 52:34.520
Yu-mi. Have a macaron. It's from Ms. Yoon.

52:35.480 --> 52:37.320
You can have it. I don't have an appetite.

52:37.400 --> 52:38.880
[She loses her desire to do anything.]

52:38.960 --> 52:41.520
Really? You didn't even have lunch--

52:42.720 --> 52:46.120
Oh, are you on a diet
because you just started dating?

52:47.280 --> 52:50.240
Gosh, I can't believe Kim Yu-mi
is refusing to have a macaron.

52:50.960 --> 52:52.480
Dating must be nice.

52:52.680 --> 52:55.360
[Every little thing someone says
to her makes her mad.]

53:09.560 --> 53:11.440
I said, wait!

53:21.160 --> 53:24.320
[Her worst memories keep replaying
in the theater,]

53:25.960 --> 53:27.800
[and she falls into a swamp of
negative thoughts.]

53:28.200 --> 53:29.280
[In the end,]

53:31.920 --> 53:33.720
[her heart becomes empty,]

53:35.600 --> 53:38.520
[and her body begins to fall apart too.]

53:42.920 --> 53:43.960
What's wrong?

53:44.440 --> 53:47.480
My head is killing me.
Do you have any medicine on you?

53:47.840 --> 53:49.920
There should be some in the lounge.
Want me to get some?

53:50.000 --> 53:51.440
No, it's fine. I'll get it.

54:17.640 --> 54:19.960
Why does my head hurt so badly?

54:33.040 --> 54:38.720
[Goo Woong]

54:33.440 --> 54:34.960
[Did you have lunch?]

54:35.040 --> 54:36.720
[What are you doing after work?]

54:41.880 --> 54:44.440
Yu-mi. Reply to his message.

54:50.760 --> 54:53.640
Yu-mi! You can't lose to Hysterius!

54:53.720 --> 54:56.360
Right! Goo Woong didn't do anything wrong!

54:56.440 --> 54:58.120
You had fun yesterday!

54:58.200 --> 54:59.880
Let's meet with him one more time. Please?

54:59.960 --> 55:02.280
You might not end up getting hurt again!

55:03.160 --> 55:05.840
[You might regret losing him.]

55:22.240 --> 55:25.760
[Ms. Kim Yu-mi]

55:23.680 --> 55:25.560
[I have no plans.]

55:27.320 --> 55:28.760
[Then...]

55:27.960 --> 55:30.920
[Then shall we have dinner together?]

55:31.040 --> 55:32.960
[I'll meet you near your office, Yu-mi.]

55:41.320 --> 55:43.080
[What time will you be done?]

55:46.200 --> 55:48.440
Oh, I'm sorry. Hold on.

55:51.200 --> 55:52.240
What was that?

56:02.400 --> 56:05.040
What is this? Is her phone broken?

56:05.120 --> 56:08.040
Why now? No, this can't be happening!

56:20.400 --> 56:22.240
Nothing is going my way today.

56:27.960 --> 56:32.320
It's not just the screen that's broken.
The LED inside is broken too.

56:32.640 --> 56:34.720
The inner parts
are completely unsalvageable.

56:35.040 --> 56:37.360
If you leave it here to get fixed,
it'll take a day.

56:37.440 --> 56:38.880
-A day?
-Yes.

56:39.240 --> 56:42.080
You won't be able to use your phone.
Will that be okay?

56:48.880 --> 56:49.960
Yu-mi.

56:53.800 --> 56:54.840
What happened to your phone?

56:56.560 --> 56:57.920
He said it'll take a day.

56:59.760 --> 57:01.880
You won't have a phone for a day?
That must be frustrating.

57:03.320 --> 57:05.960
It's okay. It's not like
I'm waiting for urgent calls.

57:06.560 --> 57:09.240
But you have that guy. The handsome one
you met on the blind date.

57:09.840 --> 57:10.960
He'll contact you.

57:11.320 --> 57:13.800
Message him on social media
and tell him that your phone's broken.

57:16.160 --> 57:17.480
No, forget it.

57:19.560 --> 57:20.720
I shouldn't see him again.

57:20.800 --> 57:21.800
Why not?

57:25.080 --> 57:26.200
I don't know.

57:27.000 --> 57:28.120
I just

57:29.040 --> 57:31.360
replied because he texted me back.

57:33.040 --> 57:34.360
I'm just not sure.

57:35.840 --> 57:37.520
I was thinking of seeing him,

57:37.880 --> 57:40.040
but I have no reason to meet him again.

57:40.120 --> 57:42.080
Why? You said he was a nice guy.

57:42.440 --> 57:44.080
Yes, he is.

57:45.600 --> 57:48.240
But he's not exactly a great catch.

57:48.400 --> 57:49.640
-What?
-Gosh.

57:49.880 --> 57:52.200
And you know what it's like.

57:52.440 --> 57:55.640
Even the ones who seem nice
always end up being such jerks.

57:57.160 --> 57:59.560
Still, it might be different this time.

57:59.880 --> 58:01.160
No, forget it.

58:03.440 --> 58:05.760
I'm sick of being hopeful every time
only to be let down again.

58:06.240 --> 58:08.080
I shouldn't even start.

58:08.160 --> 58:09.200
But still...

58:09.280 --> 58:11.000
Now, even my phone is broken.

58:11.720 --> 58:13.720
The universe is telling me
that I should stop here.

58:14.800 --> 58:17.040
I feel much better now that
I've decided not to see him again.

58:22.640 --> 58:23.720
It's raining.

58:26.520 --> 58:27.600
It is indeed.

58:32.320 --> 58:34.040
"Did you get home safely?"

58:34.120 --> 58:37.280
"Thanks to you, I had so much fun today."
Smiley face.

58:37.400 --> 58:38.600
"Oh, I see."

58:38.680 --> 58:41.720
"I hope you get to work safely too.
Have a nice day!"

58:42.160 --> 58:43.640
"Oh, by the way,"

58:44.000 --> 58:46.360
"I shaved off my beard." After this,

58:46.440 --> 58:47.680
she didn't reply.

58:48.920 --> 58:50.200
But you sent her another text?

58:50.320 --> 58:51.440
Yes.

58:51.640 --> 58:52.960
"Did you have lunch?"

58:53.120 --> 58:54.720
"What are you doing after work?"

58:54.800 --> 58:56.240
"I have no plans."

58:56.320 --> 58:57.680
"Then shall we have dinner together?"

58:57.760 --> 58:59.360
"I'll meet you near your office, Yu-mi."

58:59.440 --> 59:00.880
"What time will you be done?"

59:01.480 --> 59:03.400
You sent this message at 2 p.m.

59:03.480 --> 59:06.240
It's past 4 p.m., but she hasn't replied
when she already read your message.

59:08.160 --> 59:09.160
Then it's over.

59:10.600 --> 59:12.600
-"Over"?
-This conversation is over.

59:13.320 --> 59:15.360
Had she wanted
to carry on the conversation,

59:15.440 --> 59:17.920
she would've asked you questions

59:18.000 --> 59:19.160
about your commute this morning

59:19.360 --> 59:20.800
or told you details

59:20.920 --> 59:22.400
about what she enjoyed yesterday.

59:23.640 --> 59:26.520
Besides, she didn't use a single emoticon.

59:26.600 --> 59:28.040
You're right. She used none.

59:28.160 --> 59:29.280
Are emoticons important?

59:29.360 --> 59:30.640
They are, of course.

59:31.320 --> 59:33.280
Look at the texts she sent you
before the blind date.

59:33.360 --> 59:34.760
She used many emoticons.

59:34.960 --> 59:36.680
It means that she usually uses emoticons.

59:36.760 --> 59:38.920
But here, there's none.

59:40.400 --> 59:41.800
Here, the smiley eyes.

59:41.880 --> 59:44.800
She sent that
because you sent the smiley eyes first.

59:45.320 --> 59:47.320
No tildes or exclamation marks.

59:47.400 --> 59:48.600
And not a single emoticon.

59:48.760 --> 59:51.440
Here, look. "Have a nice day."

59:51.800 --> 59:55.080
The period here shows that
she wanted to end the conversation here.

59:55.160 --> 59:57.520
But you didn't pick up the hint
and replied to this message.

59:58.000 --> 1:00:00.400
Gosh, and you even told her
about your beard.

1:00:00.480 --> 1:00:01.640
I bet it made her uncomfortable.

1:00:02.800 --> 1:00:05.920
When you asked her
what she was doing this evening,

1:00:06.000 --> 1:00:08.080
she could already tell
that you're dangerous.

1:00:08.160 --> 1:00:09.640
That's why she's not texting you back.

1:00:09.880 --> 1:00:11.320
She's figured you out.

1:00:11.640 --> 1:00:13.360
She knows
that you'll cling onto her forever

1:00:13.440 --> 1:00:15.400
if she continues to text you back nicely.

1:00:17.280 --> 1:00:19.520
Sae-yi, you're so good
at explaining the situation.

1:00:19.600 --> 1:00:21.400
That was very succinct
and easy to understand.

1:00:21.520 --> 1:00:22.960
Clear and concise.

1:00:23.520 --> 1:00:24.680
"Concise"?

1:00:26.680 --> 1:00:29.000
I think I know
what kind of woman Yu-mi is.

1:00:29.320 --> 1:00:32.480
Gentle, kind, and pure-hearted.
That's how she is, right?

1:00:33.200 --> 1:00:35.480
Yes, some women are just like that.

1:00:35.560 --> 1:00:38.600
They're so nice
that they can't say no to anyone.

1:00:39.160 --> 1:00:42.560
If she takes this long to texts you back
or never replies,

1:00:42.640 --> 1:00:44.200
just take that as a no.

1:00:44.400 --> 1:00:45.960
She was like this yesterday
but eventually replied.

1:00:46.040 --> 1:00:47.440
"Eventually replied"?

1:00:47.520 --> 1:00:49.560
That means she had no choice but to reply.

1:00:49.880 --> 1:00:52.440
If you make another move at this stage,

1:00:52.560 --> 1:00:53.960
what does that make you?

1:00:55.400 --> 1:00:57.200
A clingy guy.

1:00:57.280 --> 1:00:58.280
What? "Clingy"?

1:00:58.360 --> 1:01:00.240
Do you now know what you should do?

1:01:01.360 --> 1:01:03.840
You know how blind dates work.

1:01:04.440 --> 1:01:05.720
Cheer up, okay?

1:01:05.960 --> 1:01:08.160
You're making me feel even worse.

1:01:10.040 --> 1:01:11.920
Well, since it's raining,

1:01:12.000 --> 1:01:14.200
how about we go for some fritters?

1:01:14.440 --> 1:01:15.960
-It's on me.
-Let's go.

1:01:16.440 --> 1:01:17.560
Let's go, okay?

1:01:18.040 --> 1:01:20.880
Let's go! Nice, let's go!

1:01:21.040 --> 1:01:23.440
♫ I love fritters ♫

1:01:23.520 --> 1:01:25.200
♫ I love fritters ♫

1:01:25.960 --> 1:01:27.440
Let's have some rice wine too.

1:01:27.560 --> 1:01:29.520
Sure. Just one bottle though.

1:01:29.600 --> 1:01:30.840
Nice, one bottle.

1:01:32.720 --> 1:01:34.080
What's taking him so long?

1:01:37.120 --> 1:01:39.080
Hey, Woong. What are you doing?

1:01:39.640 --> 1:01:40.720
Let's go.

1:01:41.440 --> 1:01:42.520
The thing is,

1:01:44.720 --> 1:01:46.920
you know that I always do the opposite
of what I'm told to do.

1:01:47.440 --> 1:01:48.560
What are you talking about?

1:01:49.720 --> 1:01:51.200
I'm slow-witted on top of that.

1:01:51.280 --> 1:01:53.240
Yes, you are slow-witted.

1:01:53.760 --> 1:01:55.120
But that's how I am.

1:01:56.360 --> 1:01:57.840
This is just how I am.

1:01:59.120 --> 1:02:00.200
You want to leave early?

1:02:00.880 --> 1:02:02.560
Yes, I'm not feeling well.

1:02:03.040 --> 1:02:05.960
I should go see a doctor.

1:02:06.160 --> 1:02:09.040
Gosh, okay. Go home and get some rest.

1:02:09.400 --> 1:02:10.600
I'm sorry.

1:02:18.040 --> 1:02:19.240
Are you all right?

1:02:19.600 --> 1:02:20.960
Your face is flushed.

1:02:21.280 --> 1:02:22.680
Do you have a fever?

1:02:23.280 --> 1:02:24.400
I think so.

1:02:24.800 --> 1:02:26.640
Hold on. Shall I call a cab for you?

1:02:27.800 --> 1:02:29.000
No, it's okay.

1:02:30.160 --> 1:02:31.360
Go home and get some rest.

1:03:17.480 --> 1:03:18.600
I didn't bring an umbrella.

1:03:28.720 --> 1:03:29.800
Yu-mi!

1:03:35.240 --> 1:03:36.480
Are you going home?

1:03:37.160 --> 1:03:39.360
-Yes.
-I heard your phone is at the repair shop.

1:03:39.560 --> 1:03:41.280
What if Woong texts you?

1:03:42.840 --> 1:03:45.240
Use my phone. I have his number.

1:03:46.200 --> 1:03:47.480
I'll figure it out.

1:03:48.280 --> 1:03:51.040
Taking too long to respond
could tire the other person out.

1:03:52.120 --> 1:03:53.120
I'll decide what to do.

1:03:53.200 --> 1:03:54.800
Come on. It's rude.

1:03:56.200 --> 1:03:57.560
Are you the one dating him?

1:03:58.000 --> 1:04:00.040
Why are you so nosy?

1:04:00.400 --> 1:04:02.280
I'm just trying to help you. That's all.

1:04:02.720 --> 1:04:04.760
Shall I call him and tell him
you're not feeling well?

1:04:06.280 --> 1:04:07.440
Enough, okay?

1:04:09.040 --> 1:04:11.280
If I tell him you're not feeling well,
he'll come running.

1:04:11.400 --> 1:04:12.560
I said, enough.

1:04:12.800 --> 1:04:14.560
Don't do anything, please.

1:04:14.920 --> 1:04:16.760
My job and my personal life...

1:04:18.000 --> 1:04:19.720
Please stop being so nosy.

1:04:24.040 --> 1:04:25.600
Are you mad at me?

1:04:26.280 --> 1:04:28.080
I really was only trying to help

1:04:28.160 --> 1:04:29.800
because you two looked so cute together.

1:04:30.440 --> 1:04:33.560
I just think Ugi made such a good call
setting you two up.

1:04:33.640 --> 1:04:34.720
"A good call"?

1:04:34.960 --> 1:04:36.000
Yes.

1:04:38.000 --> 1:04:39.720
Sure, maybe for you.

1:04:49.320 --> 1:04:52.560
Yes. All the things you couldn't stand
but have been keeping inside.

1:04:52.640 --> 1:04:54.680
Let it all go, Yu-mi!

1:04:54.920 --> 1:04:57.920
Let's wipe them up once and for all!

1:05:03.240 --> 1:05:04.400
Am I wrong?

1:05:08.720 --> 1:05:10.280
I was just trying to help you.

1:05:10.360 --> 1:05:11.440
Why would you help me?

1:05:11.520 --> 1:05:13.840
You're not feeling well.
If you go home alone, I'll be worried.

1:05:14.000 --> 1:05:15.960
If we call Woong,
he'll come and pick you up.

1:05:16.840 --> 1:05:17.960
There's no need.

1:05:18.040 --> 1:05:19.880
But you'll be alone at home. Don't be--

1:05:19.960 --> 1:05:21.200
I don't care.

1:05:23.200 --> 1:05:24.840
I was always alone.

1:05:26.200 --> 1:05:27.680
I can go to the hospital alone

1:05:28.400 --> 1:05:29.720
and go home by myself.

1:05:33.560 --> 1:05:34.760
What's wrong with that?

1:05:37.600 --> 1:05:39.280
I'm so used to it.

1:05:43.760 --> 1:05:45.440
I'm comfortable with this.

1:05:46.440 --> 1:05:48.120
So please...

1:05:57.040 --> 1:05:58.200
Yu-mi...

1:06:21.520 --> 1:06:23.400
Why are you getting soaked in the rain?

1:06:29.080 --> 1:06:30.640
You'll catch a cold.

1:07:26.320 --> 1:07:28.760
[Yumi's Cells]

1:07:30.840 --> 1:07:31.960
Excuse me!

1:07:32.640 --> 1:07:34.120
Please help this emergency patient.

1:07:34.200 --> 1:07:36.160
[Your boyfriend left it here.]

1:07:36.720 --> 1:07:37.960
My boyfriend?

1:07:38.080 --> 1:07:39.960
Hi, Yu-mi's love cell.

1:07:40.280 --> 1:07:42.360
[You went to see a girl
who wouldn't even text you back?]

1:07:42.440 --> 1:07:43.680
I just followed the algorithm.

1:07:43.760 --> 1:07:46.240
He's fallen head over heels for Kim Yu-mi.

1:07:48.000 --> 1:07:49.320
Must be nice.

1:07:49.920 --> 1:07:51.320
I have to go. Just eat without me.

1:07:51.400 --> 1:07:53.960
-Look at this.
-Wow, this is great news.

1:07:53.360 --> 1:07:54.400
[Another date tomorrow!]

1:07:55.160 --> 1:07:56.400
[I want to go now.]
