WEBVTT

02:08.197 --> 02:10.820
Nana! Nana!
Hurry up, I need a pee.

02:15.652 --> 02:17.102
Hurry, hurry.

02:17.965 --> 02:19.725
- Come on, Nana.

02:19.725 --> 02:22.694
Let me see you.

02:23.660 --> 02:25.904
God knows what
she's come up with this time.

02:25.904 --> 02:27.595
Ma, we've been here ages.
Come on.

02:27.595 --> 02:29.666
- Ma, he's going to wet himself.

02:29.666 --> 02:32.290
Would you's ever wait?
I'm trying to do me hair.

02:32.876 --> 02:34.119
We've been waiting.

02:34.568 --> 02:36.811
- Would you hurry up?
I'm bursting.

02:36.811 --> 02:38.330
We want to see you.
Come on out.

02:40.815 --> 02:42.990
- Are you's ready now?
Yes!

02:52.896 --> 02:54.691
- Jesus!
- What?

02:57.556 --> 02:58.833
Whoo-whoo!

03:03.769 --> 03:05.219
Open up, you bastard.

03:20.855 --> 03:22.409
I'll put it back,
God, I swear.

03:36.492 --> 03:37.458
Hiya, son.

03:40.323 --> 03:41.359
Hiya, Rosie.

03:43.188 --> 03:45.052
Are you hiding?
Where did Rosie go?

03:45.673 --> 03:47.054
Daniel, where's Rosie?

03:47.779 --> 03:50.195
- Jeez, give us a look at you.
- Wash your hands.

03:58.238 --> 03:59.239
George...

04:00.688 --> 04:02.103
have you any money?

04:02.103 --> 04:04.416
Why do you need it?
- Pilgrimage.

04:04.796 --> 04:06.038
What bleeding pilgrimage?

04:06.038 --> 04:07.799
We're entering
a talent contest.

04:08.696 --> 04:10.077
The winner gets two tickets

04:10.077 --> 04:11.665
to go to Lourdes
with the parish.

04:12.321 --> 04:15.116
Dolly, I don't care
what you do, win or lose,

04:15.116 --> 04:16.359
you're not taking
him to Lourdes.

04:16.359 --> 04:18.258
- Why not?
- Because I'm out there

04:18.258 --> 04:19.604
every day, breaking me bollocks

04:19.604 --> 04:21.157
and you want to give
our money to the church?

04:21.433 --> 04:23.332
- They have loads.
- We've been to all the doctors

04:23.332 --> 04:25.265
in Dublin, and they don't
know what's wrong with him.

04:25.265 --> 04:27.094
And some faker in Lourdes
is going to know?

04:27.094 --> 04:29.269
Miracles happen there, George.

04:30.925 --> 04:32.064
He could speak.

04:33.273 --> 04:34.274
That's all we want.

04:40.487 --> 04:41.902
We can't just give up on him.

04:42.661 --> 04:44.007
Look, maybe he doesn't
want to talk.

04:44.974 --> 04:46.251
That's fine with me.

04:48.667 --> 04:52.084
- Where's Rosie? Find Rosie.

04:56.744 --> 04:58.090
You going to feed the meter?

05:02.371 --> 05:05.132
Oh, Maureen,
the things I do for you.

05:05.719 --> 05:08.618
You're probably up there
in stitches, laughing at me.

05:10.517 --> 05:14.728
Let's see
if Tommy can do that.

05:32.884 --> 05:34.782
<i>And he said
"I heard you the first time."</i>

06:14.201 --> 06:16.686
Right. Here you are,
love. Mind how you go.

06:43.506 --> 06:44.645
Chrissie Aherne?

06:46.509 --> 06:48.269
- Father Dermot.
- Yeah.

06:50.479 --> 06:51.445
Thank you...

06:52.860 --> 06:53.965
for contacting me.

06:55.518 --> 06:58.487
I'm sorry I was too late.
My flight was cancelled.

06:58.487 --> 06:59.591
- I...
- You're here now.

07:00.212 --> 07:01.766
That's all that matters.

07:04.113 --> 07:06.391
Let me offer you
my heartfelt condolences.

07:06.874 --> 07:08.738
The death of a parent
is a terrible loss.

07:11.465 --> 07:12.432
I'm fine.

07:17.471 --> 07:20.716
- Big turnout for the vigil.
- Well now, you see,

07:21.302 --> 07:23.960
we have the Holy Cross All Stars
Talent Contest tonight.

07:23.960 --> 07:25.306
It's been planned for months.

07:26.273 --> 07:29.069
It's a-- it's a
fundraiser for Lourdes.

07:30.242 --> 07:31.554
Your mother was on the committee

07:31.554 --> 07:33.556
and she worked so hard
to make it a success

07:33.556 --> 07:36.628
and everyone felt that she'd
want us to go ahead with it.

07:37.042 --> 07:39.597
We kind of feel it's sort
of like Maureen's wake.

07:41.978 --> 07:43.704
I hope you don't think
we're being insensitive.

07:44.533 --> 07:45.603
It's fine.

07:49.158 --> 07:50.780
May I have the keys
to the house, please?

07:51.160 --> 07:52.851
I'm sorry, yeah, of course.

08:01.653 --> 08:03.655
-  There you go.
-  Thank you.

08:06.555 --> 08:08.004
- A lot of flowers.
- Hm.

08:10.248 --> 08:12.250
Let me know how much it cost.
I'll pay you back.

08:12.250 --> 08:13.734
The parish didn't pay
for the flowers.

08:15.287 --> 08:16.288
Who did it?

08:16.910 --> 08:19.844
Your mother's friend, Lily Fox.

08:23.572 --> 08:25.194
- Tommy.
Yeah.

08:25.194 --> 08:28.853
Would you, would you give
me a hand with this zip?

08:28.853 --> 08:30.026
- I can't...
- Yeah.

08:30.786 --> 08:33.513
God be with the days
when somebody died,

08:33.513 --> 08:35.584
the whole street went dark.

08:36.170 --> 08:40.002
Now, look at us. We're off
to do a bloody cabaret.

08:43.868 --> 08:45.041
How do I look?

08:45.594 --> 08:47.527
You look lovely.

08:52.566 --> 08:56.708
I went to visit Declan today,
asked him to bring us luck.

08:57.502 --> 08:59.228
You're not visiting
our son,

08:59.711 --> 09:01.886
you're visiting
a pile of bad memories

09:01.886 --> 09:05.061
stuffed with rocks and statues
that don't mean anything.

09:05.579 --> 09:08.927
I asked him to watch
over me tonight.

09:09.894 --> 09:11.896
What do you want to be
going to Lourdes for anyway?

09:13.794 --> 09:17.108
I've always wanted
to go there, all my life.

09:18.661 --> 09:22.631
And look, look, I'm
running out of chances.

09:26.980 --> 09:29.154
Can't catch me.
- I'll get you, Patrick.

09:29.154 --> 09:30.466
You're finished with him.

09:30.466 --> 09:32.606
Get back here.
- He's a waster, that fella.

09:32.606 --> 09:35.402
The sooner you get rid of him,
the better.

09:35.402 --> 09:36.955
I don't want to get
rid of him, Ma.

09:36.955 --> 09:38.370
Besides, where are you
going to live?

09:38.785 --> 09:40.269
Not here. We're bursting.

09:40.683 --> 09:42.305
We've put our names
down for a house.

09:42.582 --> 09:44.169
Maybe we'll get
Auntie Maureen's.

09:44.169 --> 09:47.207
Christ on a bike!
Can we bury her first?

09:49.623 --> 09:51.176
Where the hell are you going?

09:51.176 --> 09:52.971
Out.
You are on your arse.

09:53.420 --> 09:55.422
- I'm going to the pub.
- No, you're bloody-well not.

09:55.422 --> 09:56.768
You're minding
them kids for once.

09:57.251 --> 09:58.632
I'm going to the charity show.

09:59.115 --> 10:01.255
Sure, why do you want to win
a trip to bleeding Lourdes?

10:01.601 --> 10:02.774
I'm going out.

10:02.774 --> 10:04.500
One of these days
you'll come home,

10:04.500 --> 10:06.329
and I won't be
shagging-well here.

10:06.329 --> 10:08.262
Promises, promises.

10:09.367 --> 10:12.128
- You're minding them kids.

10:12.128 --> 10:13.854
- I'm not minding them.
- Oh, yeah, you are.

10:13.854 --> 10:15.994
Now, stop your whinging
and do my hair.

and then second prize

Oh, my nerves are rattling.

12:26.193 --> 12:27.298
What's wrong with you?

12:27.677 --> 12:30.404
Oh, just a little bump,
just a little one.

12:30.404 --> 12:33.407
- Is it, is it sore?
- Sore?

12:33.407 --> 12:35.962
- When you, when you touch it.
- I don't think so.

12:36.652 --> 12:40.449
Oh, well, that's a good sign,
isn't it?

12:40.449 --> 12:41.553
If it's not sore.

12:43.107 --> 12:46.006
There you go,
that's a great sign.

12:46.006 --> 12:47.042
How come?

12:47.490 --> 12:49.044
Well, if it was
the other way round,

12:49.044 --> 12:50.597
you'd should be in trouble.

12:50.597 --> 12:52.495
I thought if it's not sore,
you have it.

12:52.841 --> 12:54.014
Hm.

12:54.877 --> 12:57.328

I think we have this one.

- Oh, Jesus!

13:11.376 --> 13:12.861

14:49.854 --> 14:51.649
Absolutely brilliant, ladies.

14:51.649 --> 14:53.996
- Well done. Enjoy your night.
- Thank you.

14:53.996 --> 14:56.343
Yes, yeah, thank you.

14:56.792 --> 15:01.797
That was great, honestly.
We'll win. I know it.

15:05.939 --> 15:07.078
I don't believe it.

15:08.424 --> 15:09.632
Mother of God.

15:10.426 --> 15:11.462
Who is it?

15:11.980 --> 15:13.843
Auntie Maureen's daughter.

15:13.843 --> 15:15.604
- Mrs. Aherne had a daughter?
Yeah.

15:15.604 --> 15:16.743
Risen from the dead.

15:20.609 --> 15:21.886
I wouldn't have recognized you.

15:22.956 --> 15:26.270
Okay, 40 years will do that
to you.

15:28.099 --> 15:29.583
It'll do a lot of things to you.

15:31.654 --> 15:35.451
Well, I'm sorry for your loss.

15:40.008 --> 15:42.976
Eileen, hi.

15:45.668 --> 15:46.842
Mm.

15:46.842 --> 15:49.362
Oh, you remember me. I was--
I was sure you wouldn't.

15:49.362 --> 15:51.812
- Yeah, who forgets family?
- Yeah, who does that?

15:58.785 --> 16:02.237
I'm Dolly Hennessey,
one of the neighbors.

16:02.996 --> 16:05.792
Very sorry for your loss.
Your Ma was a great neighbor.

16:06.620 --> 16:07.621
Thank you.

16:08.484 --> 16:10.072
It's very nice
to meet you, Dolly.

16:10.072 --> 16:13.041
- You were very good up there.
- Thank you.

16:13.489 --> 16:16.285
How much were the flowers?
I want to pay you back.

16:16.976 --> 16:18.874
I bought them for your mother.

16:19.840 --> 16:21.981
She didn't think you'd be here.

16:26.019 --> 16:27.434
Why would she think that?

16:27.434 --> 16:29.333
Have you ever come back
in 40 years?

16:34.476 --> 16:35.511
For the flowers.

16:41.241 --> 16:43.485
I don't need that.

16:45.107 --> 16:48.524
It was an honor.
Your mother was a saint.

17:02.883 --> 17:05.714
Well now, who'd have thunk it?

17:06.611 --> 17:08.544
Maureen's daughter,
and coming all this way.

17:09.269 --> 17:11.271
And only a little bit late.

17:12.410 --> 17:14.240
Yes, but it's great
to have her back.

17:14.240 --> 17:17.381
Marvelous,
absolutely bloody marvelous.

17:25.078 --> 17:26.424
<i>We all thought
she was dead.</i>

17:27.046 --> 17:29.496
<i>She kept her figure
all the same though, didn't she?</i>

17:29.496 --> 17:31.533
I didn't notice a ring. Did you?

17:31.843 --> 17:33.052
Who'd have her, Lily?

17:33.742 --> 17:35.330
She's sour milk, that one.

17:35.330 --> 17:37.159
I can't believe
you's are badmouthing her

17:37.159 --> 17:38.333
and her mother only dead.

17:38.781 --> 17:41.129
She never cared about
her mother, Dolly.

17:41.129 --> 17:44.546
Coming back 40 years later
when the poor woman's gone.

17:44.546 --> 17:45.892
She was a friend.

17:46.962 --> 17:51.725
Eileen, Eileen was everything
for Chrissie.

17:52.899 --> 17:54.176
Being an only child,

17:54.487 --> 17:57.628
Eileen looked out for her,
protected her.

17:58.629 --> 18:01.425
They were cousins
and best friends.

18:02.426 --> 18:04.324
You never mentioned this before.

18:04.669 --> 18:07.534
Eileen, Chrissie and my Declan,

18:07.534 --> 18:11.297
you couldn't put a couple
of cigarette paper between them.

18:11.607 --> 18:15.439
- But why did she go to America?
-  She had to leave.

18:16.371 --> 18:17.924
- What do you mean?
-  Dolly,

18:18.166 --> 18:21.652
some things are best
left unsaid. Now, leave it.

18:23.447 --> 18:28.176
<i>♪ It be on the 23rd of June</i>

18:28.176 --> 18:31.765

18:58.033 --> 19:00.794
Dolly, Peter wants you
to have the tickets...

19:01.692 --> 19:04.315
- so Daniel can go to Lourdes.
- So, he can learn to talk.

19:06.386 --> 19:08.630
Thank you, Peter.

19:08.630 --> 19:10.045
Oh, oh. My heart.

19:11.426 --> 19:14.325
- What a boy you are.

19:15.119 --> 19:17.121
That is so good of him.

19:17.708 --> 19:21.677
- Daniel.
- You're going to Lourdes.

19:22.437 --> 19:25.716
We're going to Lourdes.

19:26.510 --> 19:29.996
- We're going with Lily.
It's wonderful.

20:16.905 --> 20:19.218
And I heard a loud voice
from the throne saying,

20:19.770 --> 20:22.669
"Look, God's dwelling place is
now amongst the people,

20:22.669 --> 20:23.877
and he will dwell with them.

20:24.568 --> 20:25.741
They will be his people

20:25.741 --> 20:28.088
and God himself will be
with them and be their God.

20:28.779 --> 20:30.712
He will wipe every tear
from their eyes.

20:32.507 --> 20:34.750
There will be no more death
or mourning

20:35.095 --> 20:36.545
or crying or pain...

20:39.824 --> 20:42.102
for the old order
of things has passed away."

21:04.504 --> 21:07.680
Is Mrs. Fox going to Lourdes
to grow her leg back?

21:08.439 --> 21:09.613
No, my love.

21:09.613 --> 21:11.270
Her leg is not going
to grow back.

21:11.270 --> 21:12.961
She's going to help Dolly
and Daniel.

21:21.970 --> 21:23.178
Wonderful service, Father.

21:24.317 --> 21:27.803
It came to me all of a sudden,
Maureen's ticket to Lourdes,

21:28.114 --> 21:30.185
it's terrible for it
to go to waste.

21:32.808 --> 21:35.742
I have this lump on my breast.

21:36.122 --> 21:38.262
I see. And have you been
to the doctor with it?

21:38.262 --> 21:39.332
Oh, no.

21:39.712 --> 21:41.265
I want to go to Lourdes.

21:42.404 --> 21:44.303
Since poor Maureen is gone,

21:44.303 --> 21:46.719
she'd want her ticket put
to good use.

21:48.962 --> 21:50.516
I'll see what I can do.

21:51.482 --> 21:52.656
Bless you, Father.

21:58.662 --> 22:00.319
I'm sorry for your loss.

22:01.078 --> 22:05.116
Your Ma asked me to give you
this in case you came home.

22:17.577 --> 22:20.235
<i>"Dear Chrissie,
if you are reading this,</i>

22:20.235 --> 22:21.961
<i>it means you came
for my funeral,</i>

22:22.720 --> 22:24.135
<i>so thank you for that.</i>

22:25.551 --> 22:27.760
<i>I remember you
saying when you left</i>

22:27.760 --> 22:30.210
<i>that you'd only come
back when I was dead.</i>

22:31.211 --> 22:32.247
<i>Welcome home.</i>

22:33.628 --> 22:36.631
<i>I don't know the pain
and the joy that you've known.</i>

22:37.183 --> 22:38.978
<i>I guess I don't really know
you at all,</i>

22:39.427 --> 22:42.395
<i>not the you
that is reading this today.</i>

22:43.431 --> 22:46.675
<i>But you're here,
and that tells me everything.</i>

22:48.367 --> 22:50.438
<i>I've been saving
for a very long time</i>

22:50.438 --> 22:54.062
<i>to come and see you in America.
I always wanted to see Boston.</i>

22:57.065 --> 22:58.860
<i>We are more alike
than you think.</i>

22:59.378 --> 23:02.208
<i>We both carry our pain
too proudly.</i>

23:04.244 --> 23:06.937
<i>I know you have no love
for Lily Fox or Eileen.</i>

23:07.627 --> 23:11.562
<i>I don't blame you for that,
but it's a heavy load to carry.</i>

23:15.290 --> 23:16.671
<i>I've left something for you</i>

23:16.671 --> 23:18.880
<i>in the top drawer
of my dressing table.</i>

23:28.959 --> 23:33.412
<i>I'm sorry for what I said.
I'm sorry for what I did.</i>

23:45.078 --> 23:47.218
<i>The last words you hear
from a mother</i>

23:47.667 --> 23:49.393
<i>shouldn't be angry ones.</i>

23:51.360 --> 23:54.847
<i>I love you, Chrissie,
with all my heart.</i>

23:56.849 --> 23:57.953
<i>God bless."</i>

23:59.161 --> 24:01.612
- Hello, hello?

24:14.556 --> 24:15.695
How are you, Chrissie?

24:17.179 --> 24:18.491
My mother is dead,

24:18.491 --> 24:21.183
I'm in a place I swore
I would never come back to,

24:21.183 --> 24:23.669
everyone is happy
as ever to see me,

24:23.669 --> 24:28.501
so overall, I'd
say, yeah, mixed.

24:29.744 --> 24:31.366
You seem a little cross, maybe.

24:32.436 --> 24:33.437
You think?

24:45.587 --> 24:46.899
- From my mother.
- Thank you.

24:48.556 --> 24:51.490
Put it to good use.
Just do not give it to the nuns.

24:55.908 --> 24:57.530
This is your mother's voucher
for Lourdes.

24:58.600 --> 25:00.878
Give it to someone who needs it.
I don't need a cure.

25:01.258 --> 25:03.225
Not everyone goes to Lourdes
for a cure.

25:05.400 --> 25:06.401
No?

25:08.368 --> 25:09.853
What was she looking for, then?

25:12.131 --> 25:13.201
Reconciliation.

25:17.067 --> 25:18.931
I think she'd like you
to go in her place.

25:22.210 --> 25:23.245
Take the voucher.

25:25.213 --> 25:26.525
I don't need it.

25:55.899 --> 25:57.176
Chrissie wanted you to have it.

26:00.973 --> 26:02.630
You didn't tell her
about my lump, did you?

26:02.630 --> 26:04.632
No, no, no, no, no.
Strictly between ourselves.

26:05.840 --> 26:08.774
Congratulations.
You're coming to Lourdes.

26:12.294 --> 26:13.744
It's a service of gratitude

26:13.744 --> 26:15.090
to God and Our Lady.

26:15.090 --> 26:17.230
Service of gratitude
to my bleeding arse.

26:17.610 --> 26:20.406
It's one big gimmick
to squeeze my money out of me.

26:20.406 --> 26:21.890
Do you not know
the "Song of Bernadette"?

26:21.890 --> 26:22.995
No.

26:22.995 --> 26:26.067
- How does it go again?
- It's not a song, it's a film.

26:26.308 --> 26:28.000
It's about St Bernadette

26:28.345 --> 26:30.312
and how she saw
the Blessed Virgin at Lourdes.

26:30.589 --> 26:32.418
You're not going
to no bleeding Lourdes.

26:32.418 --> 26:33.937
I have to go, Frank, please.

26:34.316 --> 26:35.663
You got something
all of a sudden?

26:36.008 --> 26:37.009
Course not.

26:40.529 --> 26:44.188
You're not going on any holiday
in the French Riviera

26:44.188 --> 26:48.503
with Father Too Good-looking
for his own bleeding good.

26:49.159 --> 26:50.781
You think I can't see
what's going on?

26:51.161 --> 26:54.578
I'll be helping Dolly and Daniel
and the other poor unfortunates.

26:54.578 --> 26:56.718
Unfortunate,
that's a good one.

26:56.718 --> 26:58.306
What about me?
I'm the unfortunate one.

26:58.306 --> 27:00.826
Who's going to have to do the
cooking and the cleaning

27:00.826 --> 27:02.172
and minding the children?

27:02.172 --> 27:04.346
Not me, I can tell you.
That's your job.

27:04.346 --> 27:05.416
Will you go
and sell that ticket?

27:05.865 --> 27:07.522
I'm not selling it.

27:07.522 --> 27:10.698
Sell it! Sell it
to some poor unfortunate.

27:54.673 --> 27:57.192
- Joe, how are you?
Good morning, Father.

27:57.192 --> 28:00.506
There's nobody here yet
but they'll be along anon.

28:01.093 --> 28:02.542
Right, I better go
in and get my bag.

28:02.957 --> 28:05.269
You can't go. I won't allow it.

28:05.269 --> 28:07.893
- I'm going.
- What'll I do on me own?

28:08.479 --> 28:10.689
I'll be back before you know it.

28:12.035 --> 28:14.762
Now, will you stop
making me feel bad?

28:14.762 --> 28:17.937
- What if something happens?
- Go back to bed, Tommy.

28:17.937 --> 28:19.559
You'll be safe there.

28:24.668 --> 28:27.809
Oh, Jimmy, Jimmy,
will you tell Mr. Dunne

28:27.809 --> 28:31.192
we've got a leak.
Would he call over right away?

28:31.433 --> 28:33.056
- Yes, Mrs. Fox.
Good lad.

28:34.920 --> 28:36.507
I didn't see a leak.

28:36.749 --> 28:39.338
Well, it's all wet
in the bathroom.

28:40.097 --> 28:42.859
- Just a mo.

28:58.253 --> 29:00.117
I think it's the lav.

29:00.635 --> 29:02.602
I've got to hurry,
I've got to hurry.

29:04.432 --> 29:06.089
I'm going to Tom
and Lily's house.

29:07.469 --> 29:08.470
They have a leak.

29:09.644 --> 29:13.130
- Oh, I hope it's not too bad.

29:19.861 --> 29:22.174
Tommy?

29:23.451 --> 29:25.142
Don't burn
your father's sausages,

29:25.142 --> 29:26.143
whatever you do.

29:26.523 --> 29:28.767
And remember
Patrick's asthma medicine.

29:28.767 --> 29:32.667
And look, if you still want
to marry your sweetie pie

29:33.047 --> 29:35.497
after you've cooked and cleaned
and scrubbed for a week

29:35.877 --> 29:38.362
while he sits in the pub
and talks shite with the lads,

29:38.707 --> 29:41.055
who am I to stand
in the way of true love?

29:41.331 --> 29:43.505
- Do you mean that, Ma?

29:48.856 --> 29:50.167
Now, be good to them.

29:51.513 --> 29:53.205
- What are you doing?

29:53.205 --> 29:54.344
Kissing you goodbye.

29:55.794 --> 29:57.519
It's not like I'm going
down to the shops.

29:57.865 --> 29:59.970
I'm going abroad. To France.

30:01.834 --> 30:02.835
To France?

30:03.491 --> 30:05.286
I thought you were going
to Lourdes.

30:07.633 --> 30:10.947
- But you are coming back, Ma?
- Maybe, maybe not.

30:15.054 --> 30:17.194
Eileen,
you made it. Show me that bag.

30:18.092 --> 30:20.301
- I'll put it in the back.
-  Thank you, Father.

30:26.894 --> 30:29.620
- Hello, hello.
Come and sit down.

30:29.862 --> 30:32.313
- You are here.

30:38.802 --> 30:40.804
- Where's Dolly?
- I don't know.

30:40.804 --> 30:42.530
She should be here, surely.

30:50.538 --> 30:52.989
Sorry, son,
you're going nowhere.

30:56.682 --> 30:58.995
Jesus, Dolly, don't start.

31:02.032 --> 31:03.206
What's that?

31:04.552 --> 31:07.106
- We're going to Lourdes.
- You are, me bollocks.

31:07.106 --> 31:09.384
Ruth in Number 45

31:09.384 --> 31:11.870
said she'd mind Rosie
while you're at work.

31:12.525 --> 31:14.596
Dolly. Dolly!

31:15.943 --> 31:17.047
If you go out that door,

31:17.047 --> 31:18.497
don't bleeding bother
coming back.

31:23.536 --> 31:25.159
Oh, oh, no!

31:25.159 --> 31:27.471
Father, no, we can't go,
we can't go.

31:27.471 --> 31:30.889
- We can't. Dolly is not here.
- We can't wait any longer

31:30.889 --> 31:32.304
otherwise we won't make it
to the ferry.

31:32.891 --> 31:34.547
- Fire ahead there, Joe.
A catastrophe!

31:35.410 --> 31:36.791
On, no, I can't believe it.

31:37.965 --> 31:40.312
Wait, wait, wait!

31:40.622 --> 31:42.245
- Wait a minute.
- There they are.

31:42.245 --> 31:44.903
- Stop, stop!
- She has to sit here.

31:45.248 --> 31:47.077
- Thank God, they're here.
- Oh, my God.

31:47.802 --> 31:50.115
My dear girl,
where were you?

31:50.391 --> 31:52.082
The skin
of your teeth, Dolly.

31:52.082 --> 31:53.566
Oh, yeah, as yours.

31:53.566 --> 31:56.742
- Oh, come on in.
- Daniel, come along.

31:57.018 --> 31:58.054
Hello, Father.

32:02.644 --> 32:05.130
- There we go.
- Thank you.

32:05.509 --> 32:07.960
- Oh!
- You can go ahead now.

32:08.374 --> 32:09.928
Thank you.

32:28.118 --> 32:31.328
- Holy Mary, Mother of God.
- I don't shagging believe it.

32:40.199 --> 32:42.305
Welcome, Chrissie.
There's a place here

32:42.305 --> 32:44.376
if you don't mind
sitting alongside me.

32:47.275 --> 32:48.449
Excuse me.

33:04.775 --> 33:06.191
To Lourdes, driver.

34:19.609 --> 34:20.610
Hi.

34:23.440 --> 34:24.476
What's your name?

34:27.099 --> 34:28.307
- Daniel.
-  Wow.

34:29.722 --> 34:32.070
Hi, Daniel. I'm Chrissie.

34:35.038 --> 34:36.384
He doesn't talk yet.

34:38.490 --> 34:40.768
My Ma says he'll talk
when he's something to say.

34:42.597 --> 34:43.702
Isn't that right, Daniel?

34:47.361 --> 34:48.569
Very sensible.

35:00.995 --> 35:02.652
Look, Daniel.

35:03.687 --> 35:05.827
Daniel, look,
there's the Basilica.

35:58.501 --> 36:00.158
- Welcome to Lourdes.
- Oh.

36:00.848 --> 36:03.885
Oh, Father, I can't believe it.

36:03.885 --> 36:07.475
We're here, we're really here.

36:09.719 --> 36:11.030
- Ah!
<i>- Bonjour.</i>

36:11.341 --> 36:14.793
I've always wanted
a bellboy to carry my bags.

36:16.726 --> 36:20.557
Isn't it gorgeous?
Hotel de Bernadette.

36:31.396 --> 36:34.019
Chrissie, I have you
in room number eight.

36:34.019 --> 36:36.055
- Hm.
- See you later.

36:38.989 --> 36:40.198
You, number 14.

36:42.476 --> 36:43.546
Please, this way.

36:52.486 --> 36:53.625
Isn't this lovely?

36:56.144 --> 36:58.043
Don't you get talking
to that one at all, Dolly.

36:58.595 --> 37:00.079
Who? Chrissie?

37:00.563 --> 37:02.081
What the hell
is she doing here?

37:03.255 --> 37:04.912
I think she just wanted a break

37:04.912 --> 37:06.741
with her Ma passing
and all that.

37:06.741 --> 37:07.949
I'll tell you what she's up to.

37:08.847 --> 37:09.848
What?

37:10.124 --> 37:12.126
Father Dermot,
that's what she's after.

37:18.891 --> 37:20.617
It appears
I am sharing with you.

37:22.895 --> 37:27.072
And look, the Basilica.
Isn't it beautiful?

37:28.625 --> 37:29.799
Is there only one bed?

37:31.283 --> 37:32.974
Your Ma wouldn't have fussed.

37:32.974 --> 37:36.254
Well...
I am not my mother.

37:36.599 --> 37:38.048
Ain't that the truth.

37:39.498 --> 37:40.499
What does that mean?

37:43.226 --> 37:45.055
Show some respect, Chrissie.

37:45.918 --> 37:47.920
This is a holy place.

37:52.062 --> 37:53.616
Father's taking us
to the grotto,

37:54.030 --> 37:55.583
and he's booked the baths
for tomorrow.

37:56.515 --> 37:57.758
See you downstairs, Lil.

37:58.448 --> 37:59.415
Right.

38:03.936 --> 38:05.524
Whatever the reason you came,

38:05.524 --> 38:07.595
it wasn't to sit
in a hotel room.

38:22.023 --> 38:23.922
I wasn't
expecting all this.

38:24.854 --> 38:26.476
All what?

38:26.476 --> 38:27.995
- Selling.
- Selling.

38:28.823 --> 38:29.824
Yeah.

38:30.894 --> 38:33.276
You'd think it was
Liberty Market back in Dublin.

38:33.828 --> 38:34.829
I suppose.

38:36.141 --> 38:38.005
I thought
our Lord hated all that

38:38.005 --> 38:39.386
when he chased them
out of the temple.

38:40.525 --> 38:41.871
Hard to believe though,
isn't it?

38:43.355 --> 38:46.979
Her coming after having Jesus
to coming here to Lourdes?

38:48.187 --> 38:49.568
And France, like.

38:49.568 --> 38:50.569
I mean...

38:51.225 --> 38:53.883
Why did she suddenly show up
after all these years?

38:58.128 --> 38:59.854
I'm asking myself
the same thing.

39:04.134 --> 39:05.308
What you got there, Daniel?

39:10.313 --> 39:11.349
Look!

39:14.352 --> 39:16.837
Ah. It's so pretty.

39:18.183 --> 39:20.979
I'll treat you, Daniel.
Not a word to Frank, you hear?

39:23.361 --> 39:25.880
And I'll have 12 of them
miraculous medals.

39:26.812 --> 39:28.780
Let's go and have
a look at those rosary beads.

39:29.401 --> 39:30.782
We could get one for Grandma.

39:55.358 --> 39:56.808
Mother of God!

39:59.949 --> 40:01.571
I can't believe it.

40:02.745 --> 40:05.782
Our Blessed Lady in Heaven.

40:06.093 --> 40:07.405
There's where
she appeared,

40:08.406 --> 40:10.925
right there on that spot.

40:10.925 --> 40:13.307
When you think of all
she went through...

40:14.860 --> 40:16.552
watching her poor son...

40:17.898 --> 40:19.209
crucified.

40:20.521 --> 40:23.317
She's picked a good place
to stand, all the same.

40:24.145 --> 40:27.148
- What?
- So, we could all see her.

40:28.149 --> 40:29.288
Oh.

40:34.017 --> 40:35.847
Do you believe
she really came here?

40:37.538 --> 40:41.162
The Virgin Mary picked this spot
and that girl?

40:42.819 --> 40:44.925
Yes, yes, I do.

40:47.030 --> 40:49.999
Whether she did
or not, is unimportant.

40:51.449 --> 40:53.278
You might want to keep that
to yourself.

41:04.807 --> 41:06.671
Wonder what that
one came here for.

41:07.879 --> 41:09.812
Well, maybe
our Lady brought her.

41:10.191 --> 41:13.816
I think she's nice.
So is her clothes.

41:33.042 --> 41:35.044
Would you stop staring?

41:36.770 --> 41:38.530
People hate to be stared at.

41:43.052 --> 41:45.710
Look, isn't it beautiful?

41:46.607 --> 41:49.610
See, that's where
all the crutches used to hang

41:49.610 --> 41:51.405
from all the miracles.

41:53.718 --> 41:56.203
We'll find a miracle
for you, Daniel.

41:56.514 --> 41:58.205
Daniel, Lily's talking to you.

41:58.792 --> 42:00.414
It's all right, love,
never mind.

42:00.932 --> 42:02.485
God, imagine though.

42:02.830 --> 42:03.866
What?

42:04.556 --> 42:08.008
If we seen one happening
right in front of our eyes,

42:08.595 --> 42:09.975
a miracle like.

42:10.355 --> 42:12.322
I think I'd die
if I seen people get up,

42:12.702 --> 42:14.773
throw their crutches away
and walk.

42:14.773 --> 42:16.568
But it might not
be crutches, Eileen.

42:18.363 --> 42:20.054
Other things get cured, too.

42:20.952 --> 42:22.712
Tumors and things
you can't see.

42:24.749 --> 42:25.784
Now, that's right.

42:26.751 --> 42:29.270
How do we know there wasn't
hundreds of them cures?

42:30.237 --> 42:31.859
Sure, look at Lily over there.

42:33.516 --> 42:35.518
What about Lily over there?

42:35.967 --> 42:37.865
Well, you don't need a crutch.

42:38.797 --> 42:40.005
Excuse me?

42:40.696 --> 42:43.630
For your leg.
You don't need a crutch to walk,

42:43.630 --> 42:45.183
so if you got a cure now

42:46.011 --> 42:48.117
you wouldn't have a crutch
to put up on the wall.

42:48.117 --> 42:52.949
I didn't come here looking
for my leg to grow longer,

42:52.949 --> 42:54.261
for God's sake.

42:54.261 --> 42:56.021
I wouldn't know
what to do with myself.

42:56.435 --> 42:59.611
In fact, I'd probably lose
my balance.

43:04.236 --> 43:06.307
Jesus!

43:18.250 --> 43:21.944
How in the name of Jesus
am I supposed to do this?

43:22.600 --> 43:24.325
Do what your wife
does every day.

43:24.671 --> 43:28.226
- What's that?
- Give us your hand.

43:32.610 --> 43:34.508
Oh. Hmm.

43:34.888 --> 43:36.959
Did your poor wife
pass away on you?

43:36.959 --> 43:38.167
What? Jesus, no.

43:39.306 --> 43:41.170
- She's in Lourdes.
- Lourdes?

43:42.620 --> 43:44.794
Well, there's a miracle
for her now.

43:45.692 --> 43:47.279
You, shopping.

43:48.591 --> 43:51.318
Best of luck to you.

43:54.804 --> 43:56.841
Oh.
- Jesus, poor Ma.

43:57.600 --> 43:59.222
Don't know why
she hasn't left you already.

43:59.222 --> 44:01.949
On, sorry, I forgot.
She has left you.

44:01.949 --> 44:02.985
What?

44:04.158 --> 44:05.159
Kathy...

44:06.885 --> 44:08.231
Is she not coming back?

44:08.231 --> 44:10.820
Well, ask yourself, Da,
why would she?

44:13.823 --> 44:15.135
- Rosie, hold still.

44:18.448 --> 44:20.278
- Rosie, Rosie.

44:21.900 --> 44:23.488
-  Stop it.

44:24.454 --> 44:25.663
- Come on, Rosie.
Mama.

44:26.353 --> 44:27.526
No, Mama's not here.

44:27.526 --> 44:29.321
- There you go.

44:31.565 --> 44:33.291
I think we have it.

44:34.499 --> 44:38.158
- Yeah.

44:38.537 --> 44:39.642
Yeah.

44:56.694 --> 45:00.939
<i>♪ Blue shoes, blue nails</i>

45:01.560 --> 45:05.219
<i>♪ A blue dress
That never fails ♪</i>

45:05.219 --> 45:08.533
<i>♪ There's no color
In the rainbow ♪</i>

45:08.533 --> 45:10.742
<i>♪ That my girl can't be</i>

45:10.742 --> 45:15.022
Mm.  Mm.

45:42.429 --> 45:43.810
"She'll ruin your life."

45:45.604 --> 45:46.605
What?

45:48.711 --> 45:50.230
Isn't that
what you said to Declan?

45:52.404 --> 45:55.407
-"She'll ruin your life"?
- Not now, Chrissie.

45:57.824 --> 45:59.549
I was 17.

46:01.172 --> 46:04.313
I was pregnant.
We were so happy.

46:04.692 --> 46:07.626
We were so-- How was I going
to ruin his life?

46:07.626 --> 46:09.836
I thought you were
trying to trap him.

46:11.044 --> 46:13.978
He was my son, my only son.

46:18.223 --> 46:20.778
I wanted him to have
a better life than I had.

46:22.124 --> 46:23.090
We would have.

46:27.785 --> 46:28.924
How did you manage it?

46:30.684 --> 46:32.479
How did you convince her
to shut me out?

46:35.827 --> 46:37.691
Your mother did her best,

46:38.381 --> 46:42.558
but with your father dead
there was no-one to reel you in.

46:42.558 --> 46:45.354
There was no talking to you.
You were wild.

46:46.907 --> 46:48.219
Your mother forgave me.

46:49.151 --> 46:52.602
God punished me, didn't he?
Taking my boy like that.

46:53.983 --> 46:55.295
He punished all of us.

47:34.575 --> 47:38.510
No tea, no eggs, no sausages.

47:38.752 --> 47:40.512
It's no breakfast at all.

47:41.444 --> 47:43.274
Must be what
it's like in a convent.

48:03.259 --> 48:04.882
Here, I'm gonna take
this up to Daniel.

48:06.884 --> 48:08.299
Blackberry.

48:09.438 --> 48:10.611
Not like there is at home.

48:12.406 --> 48:13.407
Want to taste?

48:18.792 --> 48:20.276
We used to pick blackberries.

48:21.691 --> 48:22.727
You and me, and Declan.

48:24.315 --> 48:27.007
We'd lie on the grass,
and we'd eat them,

48:27.318 --> 48:28.975
and we'd brag
about our future, and...

48:29.630 --> 48:32.461
...oh, God.
We were so full of ourselves.

48:34.601 --> 48:35.602
Declan and you...

48:38.777 --> 48:40.538
- and me.

48:43.506 --> 48:45.301
I never heard
you come in last night.

48:45.301 --> 48:46.268
You must have been late.

48:47.579 --> 48:49.064
Well, I'm glad
I didn't wake you.

48:50.651 --> 48:51.929
Talking to Father Dermot?

48:54.207 --> 48:55.587
A priest.

48:56.934 --> 48:58.314
You always did
love a challenge.

49:04.182 --> 49:05.459
Declan could swim like a fish.

49:07.772 --> 49:10.568
Makes you wonder how he,
of all people...

49:12.328 --> 49:13.467
- would drown.

49:29.345 --> 49:30.312
Where's Lily?

49:31.002 --> 49:32.590
Her leg was hurting
this morning.

49:44.498 --> 49:46.535
Are you coming
to the baths?

49:46.535 --> 49:48.502
-  No.
- You okay?

49:49.434 --> 49:51.747
It's just me leg. You go ahead.

49:51.747 --> 49:53.818
I'll catch up
with you's all later.

49:54.888 --> 49:55.993
So, it's...

50:00.963 --> 50:03.897
- You look pale.
- I must have overdone it.

50:09.385 --> 50:11.663
You seem to know
what you're doing.

50:16.737 --> 50:19.706
Chrissie, Chrissie, the baby.
What happened?

50:35.446 --> 50:36.516
Your pulse is normal.

50:41.762 --> 50:43.661
I think we need to get you
a wheelchair.

50:46.905 --> 50:49.874
Now, you need to take it
easy on that leg today.

50:51.427 --> 50:52.463
I'll go fetch a chair.

50:55.362 --> 50:56.363
Yeah.

51:25.772 --> 51:29.327
Now, is everyone set?
Everyone ready?

51:29.741 --> 51:33.159
Well, here we go.
This is what we came for.

51:35.816 --> 51:40.166
Now, be strong.
Whatever you might see,

51:40.959 --> 51:44.170
the heartbreak of the world
is upon us.

51:52.695 --> 51:55.733
- Is that someone dying?
- It's the water.

51:56.561 --> 51:58.770
- They say it's bitter cold.

51:58.770 --> 51:59.771
Jesus.

52:00.634 --> 52:02.464
They're not stepping
in the same water as us,

52:02.464 --> 52:04.362
- are they?
- Oh, of course, they are.

52:04.673 --> 52:05.984
But that's a bit much.

52:07.089 --> 52:08.711
We'll be catching infections.

52:08.711 --> 52:10.403
Oh, no,
you won't catch a thing.

52:10.403 --> 52:12.991
This is Lourdes.
It's another miracle.

52:12.991 --> 52:15.994
Our Lady told everyone
to come and bathe...

52:15.994 --> 52:18.687
- ...in the miraculous water.

52:20.516 --> 52:21.828
- That's the man!

52:21.828 --> 52:23.554
It's a miracle.
He's after walking.

52:23.554 --> 52:24.727
It is a miracle.

52:24.727 --> 52:26.695
- Get him in, get him in quick.

52:27.005 --> 52:29.422
- Her Lady is here.
Oh, come on Daniel.

52:29.422 --> 52:33.150
We're only here five minutes
and there's one already.

52:33.633 --> 52:34.634
Get Daniel in.

52:35.290 --> 52:38.085
- I touched him, I touched him.

52:38.085 --> 52:39.708
Get him
in the same bath.

53:04.836 --> 53:06.700
<i>Tres bien,</i> come on down.

53:11.740 --> 53:12.741
Come on.

53:14.915 --> 53:15.916
Come down.

53:32.278 --> 53:34.590
Jesus! Jesus! Jesus!

53:37.628 --> 53:38.629
It's nice.

53:40.665 --> 53:42.357
Come on, Daniel, please.

53:45.429 --> 53:47.638
I'm serious now, come on.

53:50.468 --> 53:52.470
Jesus!

53:59.443 --> 54:02.066
Jes--

54:03.964 --> 54:05.207
- Daniel.
Jesus!

54:10.419 --> 54:11.386
We're ready.

54:12.214 --> 54:13.250
I'm not.

54:16.839 --> 54:18.669
I believe you had
a miracle today.

54:19.256 --> 54:21.050
The poor crippled man
who ran out.

54:21.637 --> 54:24.744
Ah, no, false alarm.
Every day we have one.

54:25.779 --> 54:27.747
- Really?
- Every day.

54:28.644 --> 54:30.991
But only the men.
Always the men.

54:31.958 --> 54:33.131
You know what men are like.

54:35.099 --> 54:38.275
But the real miracles like,
how many a day would you get?

54:57.328 --> 54:58.536
You're all right, Daniel?

55:14.414 --> 55:15.450
Daniel!

55:16.416 --> 55:18.176
Daniel, did you say something?

55:18.176 --> 55:20.075
Say it again. Come on, come on.

55:20.075 --> 55:21.870
Dolly...
- You can do it. I'm listening.

55:21.870 --> 55:23.527
- ...just give him a minute.
- Say, Ma.

55:23.527 --> 55:26.323
- Ma. Ma, Ma, Ma, Ma, Ma.
- Dolly.

55:27.427 --> 55:28.877
We should try again, maybe.

55:29.291 --> 55:30.948
Oh, he only touched the water.

55:30.948 --> 55:32.846
If we could get him
all the way in.

55:32.846 --> 55:34.469
Dolly, just...
just look at him.

55:36.367 --> 55:37.989
Let him tell you
what he's trying to say.

55:42.339 --> 55:44.030
I'm so sorry, my love.

55:45.549 --> 55:46.653
So, sorry.

55:50.692 --> 55:53.453
- I'm a terrible mother.
- Oh.

55:53.453 --> 55:55.559
Stop it.
Dolly, it's just not true.

56:14.888 --> 56:16.925
- Well, that's that then.
- What?

56:18.547 --> 56:20.894
Guess how many miracles
there is after being.

56:20.894 --> 56:22.896
- How many? What?
- Sixty-two.

56:23.966 --> 56:27.763
- Sixty-two.
- That's very good in one day.

56:28.177 --> 56:29.178
Not in a day.

56:30.283 --> 56:32.458
Well, in a week,
that's still very good.

56:32.458 --> 56:33.424
Not in a week...

56:34.183 --> 56:38.360
since she first appeared
in 1858.

56:40.120 --> 56:41.915
1858?

56:43.434 --> 56:44.435
Oh, it couldn't be.

56:45.091 --> 56:48.128
I have to tell you,
I'm very disappointed, Lily.

56:49.371 --> 56:52.132
Frank was right.
It's all a bloody gimmick.

57:07.285 --> 57:08.839
Oh, that looks lovely.

57:09.840 --> 57:11.289
Lovely bit of stew.

57:12.118 --> 57:13.740
There you go. Now, uh...

57:15.155 --> 57:16.502
want a bit more?

57:17.399 --> 57:19.228
No, it's really good for you,
you know.

57:20.678 --> 57:22.680
Oh, boy. Uh, eat.

57:26.097 --> 57:27.167
I said eat.

57:30.447 --> 57:31.448
Mm-hmm.

57:34.554 --> 57:35.521
Well?

57:37.626 --> 57:39.076
- It's good.
- Mm-hm.

57:39.732 --> 57:41.803
It's hardly burnt at all.

57:44.012 --> 57:47.705
Excuse me, you always expect
a certain amount of burn

57:48.016 --> 57:49.189
with the stew.

57:49.189 --> 57:51.951
- Ugh, I can't eat it.

57:52.641 --> 57:54.988
- That was a bit curt.

57:54.988 --> 57:56.127
A little abrupt.

57:58.233 --> 57:59.717
Come on, eat up.

57:59.717 --> 58:01.961
I didn't know
you had it in you, Da.

58:01.961 --> 58:03.203
- Hm.
I... I don't.

58:03.203 --> 58:04.998
I... I made it up
as I went along.

58:06.137 --> 58:07.345
It's not as good as Ma's, anyway.

58:08.657 --> 58:10.866
Well, nothing is as good
as Ma's, you know.

58:41.379 --> 58:45.556

58:56.498 --> 58:59.225
And now, she's St Bernadette
all of a sudden.

59:01.089 --> 59:03.747
I don't give a shite anymore.

59:05.956 --> 59:07.785
Raising six children is,

59:08.199 --> 59:10.443
obviously, not good enough
for some people.

59:11.824 --> 59:14.516
And a nursemaid
to ten grand kids.

59:15.172 --> 59:16.173
Twelve.

59:16.898 --> 59:18.002
Twelve?

59:18.209 --> 59:20.591
<i>♪ You do the hokey pokey

59:21.903 --> 59:23.560
I love them little feckers.

You better go to bed.

59:45.167 --> 59:46.824
- Excellent.
- Thank you, Chrissie.

59:47.411 --> 59:49.309
Goodnight, Daniel.

59:49.309 --> 59:52.761
That was good, Daniel.
Now, off you go to bed.

59:53.106 --> 59:54.142
God bless, hey.

59:55.212 --> 59:56.420
Goodnight, Lily.

59:56.972 --> 59:58.802
Anyone else
have a song for us now?

59:58.802 --> 01:00:02.150
- Oh, Eileen, give us a song.
- Right, you are,

01:00:02.150 --> 01:00:04.773
so I don't have to listen
to Chrissie Aherne anymore.

01:00:07.189 --> 01:00:10.710

01:00:10.710 --> 01:00:14.265

01:00:46.919 --> 01:00:48.886
<i>♪ Down by the River Saile</i>

01:00:48.886 --> 01:00:50.819
That's enough now, Eileen.

01:00:50.819 --> 01:00:54.374
<i>♪ Are you the woman
Who killed a child... ♪</i>

01:00:54.374 --> 01:00:56.169
You can't sing that song here.

01:00:57.481 --> 01:00:59.034
Do you not like it, Father?

01:01:01.588 --> 01:01:04.039
Were you never a child?
We used to skip to it.

01:01:04.557 --> 01:01:06.179
You're in Lourdes now, Eileen.

01:01:07.318 --> 01:01:09.666
Don't you dare
lecture me, laddie.

01:01:10.943 --> 01:01:13.048
Dragging people halfway
around the world,

01:01:14.015 --> 01:01:17.225
only to disappoint them
when there is no miracles.

01:01:18.398 --> 01:01:22.230
It's a con. It's a sham.
You're a conman.

01:01:23.369 --> 01:01:26.406
Come on, its bedtime, Eileen.
Come on.

01:01:26.855 --> 01:01:28.857
Palling around
with Chrissie Aherne.

01:01:30.687 --> 01:01:32.585
If you ladies forgive me,
I'll... I'll... I'll...

01:01:32.585 --> 01:01:34.518
I can't believe you's, Eileen,

01:01:34.760 --> 01:01:38.418
carrying on like a corner boy
in Lourdes.

01:01:38.418 --> 01:01:41.111
I'm sorry. Sorry, Lily.

01:01:42.768 --> 01:01:46.047
-  Lily, I'm sorry.
- Oh, it's all right.

01:01:46.047 --> 01:01:47.220
It's all right.

01:01:47.220 --> 01:01:50.120
- Come on, we'll go to bed.
-  I am sorry, Lily.

01:01:50.534 --> 01:01:52.674
I just want to go home
and be with my kids.

01:01:53.710 --> 01:01:54.711
Come on, now.

01:01:55.884 --> 01:01:57.334
Apologies, Father.

01:01:58.438 --> 01:02:01.062
Why did you leave
and never come back?

01:02:01.062 --> 01:02:02.063
Leave?

01:02:04.134 --> 01:02:05.618
I was banished, Eileen.

01:02:07.137 --> 01:02:09.139
You were there. You remember.

01:02:09.726 --> 01:02:12.107
And who told them
about the pregnancy?

01:02:14.385 --> 01:02:15.870
You were my best friend.

01:02:17.250 --> 01:02:18.700
You were the only one I told.

01:02:19.666 --> 01:02:23.394
Why didn't you give the baby
to the nuns as you was told?

01:02:24.154 --> 01:02:28.572
- Come on, Eileen. Come on.
Don't start with me...

01:02:30.160 --> 01:02:33.232
Pretending all these years
it was an accident.

01:02:34.854 --> 01:02:37.408
It was the guilt
that killed Declan.

01:02:39.790 --> 01:02:42.551
You killed him with the guilt.

01:02:53.735 --> 01:02:56.255
Apologies, Father.
- It's okay.

01:03:01.778 --> 01:03:02.779
Poor woman.

01:03:04.677 --> 01:03:07.024
Her condition at present though,
it's hardly surprising.

01:03:54.002 --> 01:03:55.832
I just can't live
with what I've done.

01:03:57.488 --> 01:03:58.489
Dolly.

01:04:00.871 --> 01:04:02.321
- Dolly, just breathe.

01:04:03.598 --> 01:04:06.083
- Here. Come, come sit.

01:04:19.407 --> 01:04:20.857
I have to make a confession.

01:04:21.512 --> 01:04:22.893
I'll get Father Dermot.

01:04:22.893 --> 01:04:25.378
Oh, I don't think
he'll come after all that.

01:04:26.759 --> 01:04:28.347
Well, I have to confess me sin.

01:04:30.521 --> 01:04:31.729
What sin, Dolly?

01:04:32.523 --> 01:04:34.042
I ruined him.

01:04:35.733 --> 01:04:36.734
What did you do?

01:04:37.839 --> 01:04:40.566
Did you smack him, Dolly?
We all do that.

01:04:41.532 --> 01:04:43.086
- You get overwhelmed.

01:04:43.949 --> 01:04:44.915
No.

01:04:45.571 --> 01:04:47.021
The trauma in the womb...

01:04:48.677 --> 01:04:49.678
what I done on him.

01:04:50.956 --> 01:04:51.922
What did you do?

01:04:54.062 --> 01:04:55.615
I tried to miscarry him.

01:04:58.998 --> 01:05:01.587
Oh, that's old wives' tales,
Dolly.

01:05:02.381 --> 01:05:03.761
None of them work.

01:05:04.555 --> 01:05:07.489
Between ourselves,
I threw myself down the stairs

01:05:07.489 --> 01:05:09.422
more times
than I had hot dinners.

01:05:11.873 --> 01:05:13.806
Thank God,
they came out the same way.

01:05:15.946 --> 01:05:17.568
What one did you do, Dolly?

01:05:21.710 --> 01:05:22.815
I can't.

01:05:22.815 --> 01:05:25.887
Oh, it's best
you get it off your chest.

01:05:25.887 --> 01:05:29.718
You'll see yourself,
it's probably nothing.

01:05:30.650 --> 01:05:33.584
Now, how... how...
how did you try?

01:05:34.620 --> 01:05:36.484
- Just leave her alone.

01:05:37.347 --> 01:05:39.487
- She doesn't wanna say.
- But I want to tell.

01:05:39.487 --> 01:05:42.766
- I have to confess.
- No. No, you don't have to.

01:05:42.766 --> 01:05:45.251
Guilt is killing her,
isn't it, Dolly?

01:05:46.666 --> 01:05:47.667
See?

01:05:48.841 --> 01:05:50.015
Go on, Dolly, love.

01:05:51.395 --> 01:05:55.434
- I filled the bath with water.
- Dolly, don't tell them.

01:05:56.987 --> 01:05:58.126
You can tell us, Dolly.

01:05:59.507 --> 01:06:03.028
You filled the bath up
and then what happened?

01:06:04.719 --> 01:06:07.584
It was freezing,
just like today...

01:06:10.794 --> 01:06:12.382
and then I got the whisky.

01:06:13.797 --> 01:06:14.798
Whisky?

01:06:16.662 --> 01:06:17.766
Five bottles.

01:06:19.837 --> 01:06:21.529
Five bottles?

01:06:22.426 --> 01:06:24.877
You could have killed yourself
drinking five bottles of whisky.

01:06:24.877 --> 01:06:26.016
I didn't drink them.

01:06:27.535 --> 01:06:29.157
What did you do with them then?

01:06:30.503 --> 01:06:31.849
I poured them in the bath.

01:06:35.198 --> 01:06:36.958
- What did you do that for?

01:06:37.407 --> 01:06:40.479
You know why.
I sat in it to make it pass.

01:06:41.273 --> 01:06:44.276
That's how I know
I done it to him.

01:06:44.276 --> 01:06:47.313
You didn't do anything, Dolly.

01:06:49.867 --> 01:06:51.628
Sure, I mean...

01:06:52.560 --> 01:06:54.907
he's perfect, Daniel.

01:06:57.668 --> 01:06:59.049
You didn't do anything, Dolly.

01:07:02.018 --> 01:07:03.536
It has to be boiling water.

01:07:03.536 --> 01:07:05.400
How do you know,
Chrissie?

01:07:06.298 --> 01:07:08.438
Because when I made it
to Boston...

01:07:09.887 --> 01:07:11.027
my landlady...

01:07:14.064 --> 01:07:15.031
she knew.

01:07:17.033 --> 01:07:18.862
She knew I was sick every day.

01:07:20.795 --> 01:07:23.073
I think she was used
to girls like me.

01:07:24.074 --> 01:07:25.524
She told me I couldn't stay...

01:07:26.594 --> 01:07:28.837
and she gave me
a name and an address.

01:07:32.048 --> 01:07:34.360
So, I went
just a few blocks away...

01:07:36.949 --> 01:07:38.847
and this woman...

01:07:40.435 --> 01:07:41.540
she gave me pills.

01:07:42.265 --> 01:07:44.060
She gave me something to drink.

01:07:49.962 --> 01:07:52.275
She did
what she had to do

01:07:53.414 --> 01:07:54.415
and then...

01:07:55.726 --> 01:07:56.969
she put me in a bathtub.

01:08:00.662 --> 01:08:02.147
The water has to be boiling.

01:08:13.192 --> 01:08:14.159
Oh.

01:08:16.333 --> 01:08:17.610
Chrissie.

01:08:22.788 --> 01:08:24.755
Oh, thank you.

01:09:01.413 --> 01:09:02.379
Chrissie?

01:09:04.209 --> 01:09:05.313
Hmm?

01:09:07.039 --> 01:09:10.180
Would you take me
to the baths in the morning?

01:09:12.976 --> 01:09:13.977
Would you?

01:09:43.386 --> 01:09:46.872
Eileen was only doing
what she thought

01:09:46.872 --> 01:09:51.601
was best for you,
same as your Ma and me.

01:09:52.912 --> 01:09:53.913
Declan...

01:09:54.880 --> 01:09:57.158
told us you were...

01:09:57.158 --> 01:09:58.332
...you were leaving.

01:10:00.092 --> 01:10:01.093
He...

01:10:01.852 --> 01:10:03.337
God, he loved you, Chrissie.

01:10:05.235 --> 01:10:06.616
He wanted to marry you...

01:10:07.755 --> 01:10:09.274
have the baby with you.

01:10:13.726 --> 01:10:15.211
I should never have meddled.

01:10:19.076 --> 01:10:20.561
It's because...
it's because of me...

01:10:21.734 --> 01:10:23.736
- he's dead.
- Oh, Lily.

01:10:23.736 --> 01:10:26.291
-  Oh, no.

01:10:26.291 --> 01:10:27.637
We lied to him.

01:10:29.501 --> 01:10:31.123
Yeah, we were ashamed.

01:10:32.642 --> 01:10:33.643
We lied.

01:10:35.127 --> 01:10:36.370
I lied.

01:10:38.268 --> 01:10:39.235
I told him...

01:10:40.650 --> 01:10:44.654
you were going to America
to find a better life...

01:10:46.621 --> 01:10:48.209
and that you'd done with him.

01:10:52.144 --> 01:10:54.664
And it destroyed him.

01:10:57.114 --> 01:11:00.117
I destroyed him
as sure as I gave him life.

01:11:05.053 --> 01:11:07.918
Now, I'm old, Chrissie.

01:11:08.954 --> 01:11:09.955
I'll be dying...

01:11:11.059 --> 01:11:12.129
soon enough.

01:11:13.165 --> 01:11:14.649
If it's a cold as...

01:11:16.513 --> 01:11:19.896
...Eileen says it is,
it'll be very s... soon.

01:11:20.483 --> 01:11:23.934
But I... I couldn't go...

01:11:23.934 --> 01:11:25.936
We're ready for you now,
my darling.

01:11:25.936 --> 01:11:28.939
...without trying
to tell you what...

01:11:50.823 --> 01:11:51.962
- Oh.

01:13:21.362 --> 01:13:22.363
Thank you.

01:13:23.364 --> 01:13:24.952
Oh.

01:13:26.367 --> 01:13:27.437
Oh, Jesus.

01:13:28.818 --> 01:13:32.062
I was hoping
she might come to me.

01:13:33.201 --> 01:13:36.273
- Who? The Virgin Mary?
No.

01:13:36.998 --> 01:13:39.449
No, your mother, Maureen.

01:13:40.761 --> 01:13:41.969
I was hoping she might...

01:13:43.073 --> 01:13:45.213
tell me what to expect,
you know, when I...

01:13:45.835 --> 01:13:47.319
when I got up there.

01:13:48.458 --> 01:13:52.255
If I get there,
I don't suppose I deserve that.

01:13:52.842 --> 01:13:53.843
I mean, I...

01:13:55.603 --> 01:13:57.605
I haven't believed, you know?

01:13:58.503 --> 01:14:03.024
Not properly, not since,
Declan, you know?

01:14:03.024 --> 01:14:06.027
But I... I...
I didn't have the heart

01:14:06.027 --> 01:14:07.684
to say that to your mother.

01:14:09.410 --> 01:14:10.411
No.

01:14:11.101 --> 01:14:12.102
Well...

01:14:13.310 --> 01:14:15.243
you wouldn't have wanted
to take that away from her.

01:14:16.866 --> 01:14:17.832
She loved it.

01:14:19.006 --> 01:14:20.421
All the hocus pocus.

01:14:22.423 --> 01:14:24.908
Well, there's always hope,
isn't there?

01:14:25.219 --> 01:14:28.602
Um, even... even when you don't
completely believe.

01:14:31.259 --> 01:14:32.260
Peace...

01:14:34.297 --> 01:14:35.367
that's what I hope for.

01:14:37.473 --> 01:14:38.474
Peace.

01:14:42.581 --> 01:14:44.894
I'm glad you came home, Chrissie.

01:14:46.067 --> 01:14:49.036
Your mother would
have been so proud.

01:14:51.314 --> 01:14:54.731
I've... I've no right
to ask you this, but...

01:14:55.905 --> 01:14:57.562
can you ever forgive me?

01:15:08.020 --> 01:15:09.366
Thank you.

01:15:12.162 --> 01:15:14.302
Thank you, Chrissie.

01:15:25.866 --> 01:15:27.764
I'm sorry about last night, Father.

01:15:29.386 --> 01:15:30.526
I don't take it back.

01:15:31.734 --> 01:15:33.701
You're, uh,
what do you call it...

01:15:34.909 --> 01:15:36.359
I gather the baths didn't help.

01:15:38.879 --> 01:15:40.743
You don't come to Lourdes
for a miracle, Eileen.

01:15:41.640 --> 01:15:42.745
You come for the strength

01:15:42.745 --> 01:15:43.918
to go on
when there is no miracle.

01:15:49.510 --> 01:15:50.511
Hmm.

01:16:26.616 --> 01:16:27.583
I loved you.

01:16:31.034 --> 01:16:32.898
I loved you and you left.

01:16:38.007 --> 01:16:39.008
So, I hated you.

01:16:43.460 --> 01:16:44.461
I didn't mean to...

01:16:46.429 --> 01:16:47.430
but I did.

01:16:52.159 --> 01:16:53.609
But I never hated you...

01:16:55.576 --> 01:16:56.784
more than I loved you.

01:17:03.066 --> 01:17:06.104
And that is what
God's punishing me for.

01:17:09.797 --> 01:17:12.248
- The hate.
- Punishing you?

01:17:16.873 --> 01:17:17.840
I have a lump...

01:17:19.117 --> 01:17:20.118
in my breast.

01:17:23.190 --> 01:17:24.191
Here.

01:17:29.852 --> 01:17:33.027
- There'll be no miracle for me.
- What does the doctor say?

01:17:36.893 --> 01:17:38.067
Have you been to a doctor?

01:17:46.385 --> 01:17:48.353
Why can't people like us
have miracles?

01:17:52.081 --> 01:17:53.979
Why can't I have a miracle?

01:17:56.741 --> 01:17:57.983
I go to Mass.

01:17:59.260 --> 01:18:01.297
- I come to Lourdes.
- We'll go together...

01:18:03.506 --> 01:18:05.542
to the doctor.
We'll find you the best one.

01:18:10.030 --> 01:18:10.996
I'll go with you.

01:18:22.767 --> 01:18:25.493
- Does it hurt?
- Yeah.

01:18:26.805 --> 01:18:30.326
- And that's bad, isn't it?
- No. That's... that's hopeful.

01:18:33.950 --> 01:18:34.917
Are you losing weight?

01:18:37.471 --> 01:18:39.093
Does it look like
I've lost weight?

01:18:39.093 --> 01:18:40.577
- You cow.

01:18:41.924 --> 01:18:43.788
- Well.

01:18:44.927 --> 01:18:48.137
- That is a very, very good sign.

01:19:28.798 --> 01:19:29.799
Dolly?

01:19:30.627 --> 01:19:32.802
George told me that
if I went to Lourdes

01:19:32.802 --> 01:19:36.426
- I shouldn't bother coming back.
- I'm sure he didn't mean it.

01:19:42.985 --> 01:19:44.814
Okay. Go get him, come on.

01:19:45.988 --> 01:19:46.954
Wish me luck.

01:19:58.863 --> 01:20:00.796
Mama.

01:20:01.486 --> 01:20:02.521
Hello.

01:20:03.799 --> 01:20:06.491
- Hi.  We've missed you.

01:20:06.491 --> 01:20:07.941
It was terrible quiet
without you.

01:20:09.287 --> 01:20:10.288
We missed you.

01:20:12.842 --> 01:20:13.809
Hiya, son.

01:20:15.224 --> 01:20:16.225
Did you enjoy yourself?

01:20:18.883 --> 01:20:19.849
Let me see.

01:20:24.198 --> 01:20:25.165
That is something.

01:20:35.382 --> 01:20:38.212
- Ah, love. Long lost love.
- We missed you.

01:20:39.420 --> 01:20:41.112
- Who is this little man?

01:20:41.112 --> 01:20:42.665
- It's so good to see you.
Hi.

01:20:42.665 --> 01:20:43.942
Hello.
Hi, Nana.

01:20:43.942 --> 01:20:45.979
Oh...  ...darling,
darling, look at you.

01:20:46.289 --> 01:20:47.290
Look at you.

01:20:47.808 --> 01:20:48.844
Hey.

01:20:51.018 --> 01:20:53.400
Ah, let a man at that,
would you?

01:20:54.539 --> 01:20:56.092
Frank, what have you done now?

01:20:56.610 --> 01:20:59.475
- Just trying to make you happy.
- Happy?

01:21:00.372 --> 01:21:01.649
What do you mean, happy?

01:21:02.650 --> 01:21:03.651
Happy.

01:21:07.414 --> 01:21:09.588
- Great to have you back.
- Oh.

01:21:14.421 --> 01:21:15.905
I think I had me a miracle.

01:21:16.975 --> 01:21:17.942
What?

01:21:18.770 --> 01:21:19.944
I actually missed you.

01:21:22.222 --> 01:21:23.257
Aw.

01:21:33.267 --> 01:21:35.960
- Oh, Tommy!

01:21:36.581 --> 01:21:40.136
- You're still alive.
-  Just about.

01:21:40.136 --> 01:21:43.105
Thought I'd hang around,
wanted to see your face.

01:21:43.105 --> 01:21:46.418
- Oh, bless you, Tommy.

01:21:49.076 --> 01:21:50.043
You look...

01:21:51.009 --> 01:21:52.286
different.

01:21:53.115 --> 01:21:54.254
You too.

01:21:56.773 --> 01:21:58.051
Dada.

01:22:02.365 --> 01:22:04.091
Where's Rosie?
Where's she gone?

01:22:04.091 --> 01:22:06.162
Where is she?

01:22:06.162 --> 01:22:07.508
There she is. There's Rosie.

01:22:07.508 --> 01:22:09.683
Where's she gone?

01:22:09.683 --> 01:22:11.098
- There's Rosie.
- Home.

01:22:15.758 --> 01:22:18.588
I'm just got to go and see,
you know...

01:22:18.588 --> 01:22:20.245
I know, I know.

01:22:21.488 --> 01:22:22.765
Thank you. See you.

01:22:23.593 --> 01:22:25.112
I want to show you something.

01:22:26.010 --> 01:22:29.496
Will you come with me?
It's not that far.

01:22:32.154 --> 01:22:33.983
It's a walk
I never thought

01:22:33.983 --> 01:22:34.950
I'd take with you.
