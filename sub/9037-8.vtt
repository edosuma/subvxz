00:02.369 --> 00:06.672
- You know, every night
for five years...Ugh...

00:06.674 --> 00:08.240
"little engine that could,"

00:08.242 --> 00:10.075
"goodnight moon,"
"cat in the hat."

00:10.077 --> 00:12.511
I am sick of them.

00:12.513 --> 00:14.380
- They're not for you.

00:14.382 --> 00:16.715
Right?

00:16.717 --> 00:18.250
What do you want
to read the kids,

00:18.252 --> 00:21.153
Jackie collins?

00:21.155 --> 00:23.655
- No, I was just thinking,
you know,

00:23.657 --> 00:25.057
Maybe I could do that.

00:25.059 --> 00:27.059
Maybe I could write
a children's book.

00:27.061 --> 00:28.060
- Yeah?

00:28.062 --> 00:29.061
- Yeah, you think?

00:29.063 --> 00:31.296
- Yeah, it's great,

00:31.298 --> 00:35.501
If you're looking
for something to do.

00:35.503 --> 00:38.337
- I have things to do, ray.

00:38.339 --> 00:39.605
- Ow!

00:45.445 --> 00:46.678
- All right,
so what do you think

00:46.680 --> 00:48.047
About this book idea?

00:48.049 --> 00:50.049
- Yeah, it's a great idea.

00:50.051 --> 00:51.183
You need any help,
let me know.

00:51.185 --> 00:53.318
- Yeah, that's just what
I was thinking.

00:53.320 --> 00:55.120
- What?
- You could help me.

00:55.122 --> 00:56.422
We could write it
together.

00:56.424 --> 00:57.823
- Oh, wait a minute.
- What? Come on.

00:57.825 --> 00:59.591
You just said,
"if you need any help..."

00:59.593 --> 01:02.361
- You didn't let me finish,

01:02.363 --> 01:04.496
By "help," I meant that
when you're done,

01:04.498 --> 01:05.497
I would read it

01:05.499 --> 01:08.100
And tell you
it's very good.

01:08.102 --> 01:09.701
- Oh, come on.
Come on.

01:09.703 --> 01:11.136
I want to do this
with you.

01:11.138 --> 01:12.136
Wouldn't this be
so much fun

01:12.138 --> 01:14.106
To spend time
together like this?

01:14.108 --> 01:16.275
- No.

01:16.277 --> 01:18.177
Writing is what I do
for a living.

01:18.179 --> 01:19.678
I don't want to spend
my free time writing.

01:19.680 --> 01:21.080
- But you love writing.

01:21.082 --> 01:23.315
- No.

01:23.317 --> 01:26.418
It's--it's torture.
It's excruciating.

01:26.420 --> 01:28.620
- Yeah, but lookit,
I already have an idea.

01:28.622 --> 01:31.223
I just need you to help me
flesh it out, you know?

01:31.225 --> 01:33.692
Because you are such
a good writer, ray.

01:33.694 --> 01:35.127
I respect your talent
so much.

01:35.129 --> 01:36.528
- Oh, don't even
start with that

01:36.530 --> 01:40.866
Unless you're willing
to back it up with sex.

01:40.868 --> 01:44.570
- Don't talk about sex.
We're here.

01:44.572 --> 01:47.673
- Ma, debra's thinking
of writing a book.

01:47.675 --> 01:50.342
- A sex book?

01:50.344 --> 01:52.211
- No, no, no, no.
A children's book.

01:52.213 --> 01:54.446
I was just thinking
of trying it.

01:54.448 --> 01:57.382
- Ooh, I have a wonderful
story for you, debra.

01:57.384 --> 01:59.885
When robert was ten,
he was in little league.

01:59.887 --> 02:01.687
And before
one of his games,

02:01.689 --> 02:03.222
I asked if he had to go
to the bathroom.

02:03.224 --> 02:04.490
And he said no.

02:04.492 --> 02:07.126
So it's his turn
with the bat,

02:07.128 --> 02:09.495
And, sure enough,
he wets his pants.

02:09.497 --> 02:13.799
[chuckling]

02:13.801 --> 02:17.836
- Aw, isn't that charming?

02:17.838 --> 02:20.772
- Hey.

02:20.774 --> 02:25.410
Is this about me?

02:25.412 --> 02:26.778
- Your mother
was just telling the story

02:26.780 --> 02:28.580
About how you
wet your pants at home plate.

02:28.582 --> 02:30.315
- Ma!

02:30.317 --> 02:32.184
- It's for debra's
children's book.

02:32.186 --> 02:33.185
- It's gonna be
in a book?

02:33.187 --> 02:35.154
- Oh, no, marie.

02:35.156 --> 02:37.322
Marie, please, I don't think
I'm gonna use the story.

02:37.324 --> 02:39.258
- That's my story.
You can't use it.

02:39.260 --> 02:40.726
I have the rights
to that story.

02:40.728 --> 02:42.361
- Robert,
I'm not using the story.

02:42.363 --> 02:44.830
- Why not?
It's an important story.

02:44.832 --> 02:49.368
It has a moral about how kids
shouldn't tease other kids

02:49.370 --> 02:50.536
And how you should
listen to your mother

02:50.538 --> 02:54.373
And not hold it.

02:54.375 --> 02:56.241
- I tell you what.
Whatever you do,

02:56.243 --> 02:57.643
I'll do the pictures
for it.

02:57.645 --> 02:58.944
- Pictures?

02:58.946 --> 03:00.412
- I've dabbled
in the visual arts.

03:00.414 --> 03:03.348
I've painted
some bullfighters,

03:03.350 --> 03:06.952
Some nudes.

03:06.954 --> 03:08.387
- You painted naked ladies

03:08.389 --> 03:10.622
Off a deck
of dirty cards.

03:10.624 --> 03:12.391
- I had to.

03:12.393 --> 03:14.526
After robert was born,
you stopped posing for me.

03:14.528 --> 03:16.428
- Frank!

03:16.430 --> 03:19.398
- What?

03:19.400 --> 03:22.701
- Okay, I have
to gouge out my eyes.

03:22.703 --> 03:27.606
- You can't gouge out
your mind's eye.

03:27.608 --> 03:29.541
- So do you want me
to bring over my portfolio?

03:29.543 --> 03:32.344
- I'm gonna be concentrating
on the story.

03:32.346 --> 03:34.413
- Hey, you know, debra,
I got a great story for you.

03:34.415 --> 03:37.950
It's about
a tall crime fighter.

03:37.952 --> 03:39.918
- Does he live
with his parents?

03:39.920 --> 03:41.353
- Could.

03:41.355 --> 03:42.487
- No, no, no.

03:42.489 --> 03:44.289
I have another story for you,
dear.

03:44.291 --> 03:46.291
We were on a long car ride,

03:46.293 --> 03:48.627
And before we leave,
I warn robert--

03:48.629 --> 03:51.530
- Ma!

03:51.532 --> 03:53.432
- Look, mom, dad,
everybody,

03:53.434 --> 03:55.567
Debra--she's already got
somebody who's gonna help her.

03:55.569 --> 03:57.236
Me.
- Really?

03:57.238 --> 03:59.605
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
It'll be fun.

03:59.607 --> 04:01.273
Okay,
so thanks anyway.

04:01.275 --> 04:03.709
Thank you.

04:03.711 --> 04:04.943
- Listen, raymond,

04:04.945 --> 04:06.511
If you're gonna use
the baseball story,

04:06.513 --> 04:07.746
At least put in
that I was the one

04:07.748 --> 04:09.314
Who scored
the winning run.

04:09.316 --> 04:11.250
- Nobody wanted
to tag you.

04:17.857 --> 04:20.525
- Ray, I am so excited.

04:20.527 --> 04:21.560
Come on, hurry up.

04:21.562 --> 04:22.761
We got to fire up
the computer.

04:22.763 --> 04:25.831
- Yeah, don't hurt yourself.

04:25.833 --> 04:27.432
- Okay, it's--

04:27.434 --> 04:28.667
- You're in my chair.

04:28.669 --> 04:29.935
- Oh, sorry.

04:29.937 --> 04:33.505
Here.
You sit, and...Here.

04:33.507 --> 04:36.775
This.
Okay.

04:36.777 --> 04:39.645
This is so great, honey.

04:39.647 --> 04:41.380
All right.

04:41.382 --> 04:43.849
[computer game starts to play]

04:43.851 --> 04:45.317
What are you doing?

04:45.319 --> 04:46.317
- Getting ready.
Getting ready.

04:46.319 --> 04:48.987
I play a little
"galactic defender" first.

04:48.989 --> 04:50.422
- What about the story?

04:50.424 --> 04:51.757
- In a minute.
In a minute.

04:51.759 --> 04:54.960
I just gotta save
the planet krimulac.

05:01.467 --> 05:02.701
Nuh-nuh-nuh-nuh.

05:02.703 --> 05:03.702
- Are you almost ready?

05:03.704 --> 05:04.903
Because I have all these ideas.

05:04.905 --> 05:06.705
- One second. One second.
One second.

05:06.707 --> 05:09.975
Gotcha,
you ugly green bastard.

05:09.977 --> 05:14.579
- Okay, good.
Now here's my idea.

05:14.581 --> 05:15.847
I was thinking--

05:15.849 --> 05:17.849
- Hold it.
Hold it.

05:17.851 --> 05:19.484
- What is that?

05:19.486 --> 05:21.320
- I like to squeeze this
12 times.

05:21.322 --> 05:22.320
- Why?

05:22.322 --> 05:23.922
- You gotta respect
the process.

05:23.924 --> 05:29.027
Gets the juices going.

05:29.029 --> 05:30.429
- Okay, you got
enough juice there?

05:30.431 --> 05:32.331
- Yeah.
- Okay.

05:32.333 --> 05:35.367
So here's what
I was thinking.

05:35.369 --> 05:37.803
Do you remember
that time

05:37.805 --> 05:41.473
When ally wanted
to run away from home,

05:41.475 --> 05:43.375
And we let her
pack her suitcase

05:43.377 --> 05:44.976
With all her toys
and her clothes?

05:44.978 --> 05:47.346
- Oh, yeah, yeah.
- Yeah?

05:47.348 --> 05:49.081
- Then she started
talking about each thing

05:49.083 --> 05:51.416
And where she got it,
who gave it to her.

05:51.418 --> 05:52.884
- Yes, and by the time
she was done packing,

05:52.886 --> 05:55.020
She'd forgotten that she wanted
to run away from home.

05:55.022 --> 05:58.657
- Right, right, because of all
the good memories in the stuff.

05:58.659 --> 06:00.459
- Yeah.
Yeah.

06:00.461 --> 06:02.027
- Yeah, I like that idea.
I really do.

06:02.029 --> 06:05.464
- Oh, good!
- Okay.

06:05.466 --> 06:06.932
- Where are you going?
- Bathroom.

06:06.934 --> 06:08.500
- We just got started.

06:08.502 --> 06:09.634
- I know,
but when a good idea hits,

06:09.636 --> 06:10.836
I have to go
to the bathroom.

06:10.838 --> 06:12.037
- Oh, no, come on.
Ray, come on.

06:12.039 --> 06:13.538
We're on a roll here.

06:13.540 --> 06:15.006
Don't break the momentum.
Please?

06:15.008 --> 06:17.743
- All right.

06:17.745 --> 06:18.877
You know,
it's not good to hold it.

06:18.879 --> 06:21.079
- Yeah.

06:21.081 --> 06:22.881
Okay.

06:22.883 --> 06:25.584
So...

06:25.586 --> 06:26.785
I was thinking,

06:26.787 --> 06:28.754
We make the main
character a bunny.

06:28.756 --> 06:31.089
- Oh, a bunny?

06:31.091 --> 06:32.624
- Why, what's wrong
with a bunny?

06:32.626 --> 06:35.527
- Hasn't the bunny thing
been done, really?

06:35.529 --> 06:37.396
- Well, what did you
have in mind?

06:37.398 --> 06:40.031
- Nothing.

06:40.033 --> 06:41.733
- No, no.
Go ahead, tell me.

06:41.735 --> 06:43.568
If you got something better,
I want to know.

06:43.570 --> 06:45.937
- Okay.

06:45.939 --> 06:49.674
How about a...Dinosaur?

06:49.676 --> 06:51.610
- Ooh, a dinosaur?

06:51.612 --> 06:53.578
- What?

06:53.580 --> 06:54.713
- Eh, I don't know.

06:54.715 --> 06:55.981
I just think
that's a little...

06:55.983 --> 06:58.617
Trendy.

06:58.619 --> 07:01.953
- Well, bunny's hack.

07:01.955 --> 07:04.790
- Hack?
You're calling me a hack?

07:04.792 --> 07:06.992
- I'm not calling you a hack.
Your bunny's a hack.

07:06.994 --> 07:09.594
- No, no, no,
the bunny is classic, ray.

07:09.596 --> 07:11.730
It's the dinosaur that has been
done to death.

07:11.732 --> 07:14.099
- Look, look, it doesn't have
to be the dinosaur.

07:14.101 --> 07:17.068
I just hate the bunny.

07:17.070 --> 07:18.603
- Well, you got nothing,
sweetie,

07:18.605 --> 07:20.772
So it's gonna be a bunny, okay?

07:20.774 --> 07:23.175
- Well,
take my name off it.

07:23.177 --> 07:24.910
- Off of what?
We haven't even started yet!

07:24.912 --> 07:26.445
We spent the whole time

07:26.447 --> 07:28.146
Going through
your satanic rituals.

07:28.148 --> 07:29.881
- Hey, that's how I work.

07:29.883 --> 07:32.117
- Oh, well, let me know when
you're goofing off, okay?

07:32.119 --> 07:34.953
- Well, my "goofing off"
supports this household.

07:34.955 --> 07:38.723
- Oh, and what I do
doesn't support the household.

07:38.725 --> 07:40.625
- I'm just saying
I get paid for what I do.

07:40.627 --> 07:41.625
- And I'm just dead weight?

07:41.627 --> 07:44.529
- No, but you asked me to help,
and this is how I help.

07:44.531 --> 07:46.064
- Well, you know what, ray?
I don't want your help.

07:46.066 --> 07:48.166
- Good, good, good, good.

07:48.168 --> 07:49.968
'cause I didn't wanna help
in the first place.

07:49.970 --> 07:52.804
- Okay, good.
So everybody's happy.

07:52.806 --> 07:53.672
- Good!

08:11.524 --> 08:12.724
Hi.

08:12.726 --> 08:15.727
- Hi.

08:15.729 --> 08:16.895
- Sorry I'm late.

08:16.897 --> 08:18.263
- Yeah.

08:26.272 --> 08:28.773
- Oh, you're workin'
on your thing?

08:28.775 --> 08:32.043
- [sighs]
yes, yes, yes.

08:32.045 --> 08:34.145
- I was wonderin'...

08:34.147 --> 08:37.249
Are we still fighting?

08:37.251 --> 08:39.751
- What?
No, no, no.

08:39.753 --> 08:42.287
- Good.
Good.

08:42.289 --> 08:44.523
I almost bought flowers.

09:01.774 --> 09:04.576
- [muttering]

09:14.720 --> 09:15.320
Whoo!

09:21.160 --> 09:25.230
- So how was your day?

09:25.232 --> 09:27.332
- I can't do this.

09:27.334 --> 09:29.167
It was such stupid idea,

09:29.169 --> 09:31.036
Me trying to write a book.

09:31.038 --> 09:34.039
- Look, it just takes time,
that's all.

09:34.041 --> 09:35.840
Come on.
Come on.

09:35.842 --> 09:37.809
Look, there must be something
good in here someplace--

09:37.811 --> 09:40.145
- No, no! Give--
not one word!

09:40.147 --> 09:43.949
Ugh! I just hate
this freakin' bunny!

09:43.951 --> 09:45.784
- Come on,
you don't hate the bunny.

09:45.786 --> 09:46.918
The bunny's good.

09:46.920 --> 09:49.020
- Hate him, ray.
Hate him.

09:49.022 --> 09:50.589
I would want to run away, too,

09:50.591 --> 09:53.658
If I was stuck in
a piece of crap like...

09:53.660 --> 09:54.659
That!

09:59.031 --> 10:00.231
I don't know
how you do it.

10:00.233 --> 10:02.634
I don't know how you do it.

10:02.636 --> 10:04.736
Every day, writing?

10:04.738 --> 10:07.138
It's hell.
It's hell.

10:07.140 --> 10:09.641
- Well...

10:09.643 --> 10:10.942
Yeah.

10:13.879 --> 10:16.848
I try not
to bring it home.

10:16.850 --> 10:19.050
Guess you've gotten
a little peek there.

10:19.052 --> 10:21.286
I mean, it's not all
hangin' out at the games

10:21.288 --> 10:23.655
With the guys
and the hot dogs

10:23.657 --> 10:28.093
And the
make-your-own sundaes.

10:28.095 --> 10:31.162
- Well...

10:31.164 --> 10:36.001
I suck.
Good night.

10:36.003 --> 10:38.203
- You know,
it's not easy for anybody.

10:38.205 --> 10:40.805
Come on.
I mean, in the beginning--

10:40.807 --> 10:43.208
I remember when I was
just a beat writer

10:43.210 --> 10:46.378
Covering the local
high school games.

10:46.380 --> 10:48.013
I was obviously
pretty talented,

10:48.015 --> 10:52.350
But I was just
a diamond in the rough, really.

10:59.158 --> 11:03.762
We'll pick up on this tomorrow,
all right?

11:03.764 --> 11:05.964
Remind me where I was.

11:38.831 --> 11:41.433
[mumbling]

11:48.074 --> 11:50.408
Oh, still the man.

11:54.046 --> 11:56.347
Morning, everybody.

11:56.349 --> 11:58.049
- Hey.
- Good morning.

11:58.051 --> 11:59.117
- Hey.

11:59.119 --> 12:00.351
- What were you doing
up so late?

12:00.353 --> 12:03.888
I looked at the clock.
It was 4:30.

12:03.890 --> 12:04.956
- Ta-da!

12:04.958 --> 12:07.992
- What's this?

12:07.994 --> 12:13.765
Oh, my gosh.
This is the story.

12:13.767 --> 12:16.067
You did the whole thing.

12:16.069 --> 12:17.168
- I felt bad
'cause you got stuck,

12:17.170 --> 12:18.770
So I rearranged
a couple of things.

12:18.772 --> 12:21.339
I ironed out some
of the rough spots, that's all.

12:21.341 --> 12:24.409
Look, look.
I went with the bunny.

12:24.411 --> 12:26.077
You were right.
The bunny's good.

12:26.079 --> 12:28.046
The bunny's classic.
Kids love the bunny.

12:28.048 --> 12:30.048
- Yeah.

12:30.050 --> 12:32.917
Okay.
Thanks.

12:32.919 --> 12:35.120
- You're welcome.

12:35.122 --> 12:38.356
All right.
I'm gonna grab some sleep.

12:38.358 --> 12:40.525
Enjoy.

12:43.763 --> 12:46.131
- Winky.

12:46.133 --> 12:50.101
Oh, he named
the bunny winky.

12:53.205 --> 12:55.807
- Hey, hey.
Guess who I talked to today.

12:55.809 --> 12:57.509
Gerry ashley.

12:57.511 --> 13:00.211
- Who's that?
- That's my publisher friend.

13:00.213 --> 13:02.080
He's gonna look
at the book tomorrow.

13:02.082 --> 13:04.115
- Oh, honey,
it's not quite done yet.

13:04.117 --> 13:07.152
- What are ya talkin' about?
I finished it.

13:07.154 --> 13:08.953
- Yeah,
well, I mean, you know,

13:08.955 --> 13:10.789
Your version had
some good stuff in it,

13:10.791 --> 13:15.927
But it, uh, it wasn't
quite there yet, you know?

13:15.929 --> 13:17.996
- You're rewriting me?

13:17.998 --> 13:19.864
- No.

13:19.866 --> 13:21.132
No.

13:21.134 --> 13:22.867
It was just minor,
you know?

13:22.869 --> 13:26.805
Minor tweaks.

13:26.807 --> 13:28.873
- You made it rhyme.

13:28.875 --> 13:31.009
- Yeah. Yeah.
Kids love rhymes.

13:31.011 --> 13:32.477
And it came
really easy to me.

13:32.479 --> 13:35.914
- "the bunny hopped here.
The bunny hopped there.

13:35.916 --> 13:40.952
The bunny hop-hopped
to the top of the square."

13:40.954 --> 13:43.321
- What?

13:43.323 --> 13:46.491
- Isn't that a little...
Cutesy?

13:46.493 --> 13:48.359
- Cutesy?

13:48.361 --> 13:53.264
Ah, you're the one that
named your bunny "winky."

13:53.266 --> 13:54.532
- Hey, I didn't even
want the bunny.

13:54.534 --> 13:57.302
I went with the bunny
for you, okay?

13:57.304 --> 13:58.536
And as long as I'm stuck
with a bunny,

13:58.538 --> 14:01.005
Winky's a perfect name
for a bunny.

14:01.007 --> 14:03.374
- It's not better than clive.

14:03.376 --> 14:05.476
- Clive?

14:05.478 --> 14:06.477
Clive?

14:06.479 --> 14:10.448
What, are you
from piccadilly?

14:10.450 --> 14:12.317
[with british accent]
'ello. I'm clive.

14:12.319 --> 14:16.554
I'm 'appy
to be alive.

14:16.556 --> 14:18.489
- First of all, that is
the worst british accent

14:18.491 --> 14:20.258
I have ever heard, all right?

14:20.260 --> 14:23.428
Second of all,
stay away from my story.

14:23.430 --> 14:26.097
- I saved your story.
You had nothin'.

14:26.099 --> 14:27.131
I made it
into something.

14:27.133 --> 14:29.400
- Who asked you?
- You did!

14:29.402 --> 14:32.070
- No, I asked you
to do it with me,

14:32.072 --> 14:34.239
Not for you to do it.

14:34.241 --> 14:36.207
- Well, I'll tell you
what I'm not doin'.

14:36.209 --> 14:39.410
I'm not showing
clive to gerry ashley.

14:39.412 --> 14:40.979
- Okay, fine,

14:40.981 --> 14:43.014
Just forget about your
big-shot publisher friend.

14:43.016 --> 14:44.515
Let's ask ally
which one she likes best.

14:44.517 --> 14:45.617
- Fine!
Wake her up!

14:45.619 --> 14:48.319
- No! We're not gonna
wake her up.

14:48.321 --> 14:50.588
We'll read it to her
over the next couple of days.

14:50.590 --> 14:53.291
I'll read her clive,
and you can read her winky.

14:53.293 --> 14:54.292
- Yeah, good.
You're on!

14:54.294 --> 14:55.560
Huh?
You man enough?

14:55.562 --> 14:57.195
- Yes, I'm man enough.

14:57.197 --> 14:59.264
- Good, good.
'cause clive's goin' down!

15:05.104 --> 15:08.239
And winky was glad
to be home,

15:08.241 --> 15:15.179
Even though she had
never...Really...Left.

15:15.181 --> 15:17.482
The end.

15:20.019 --> 15:24.689
[sighs heavily]

15:24.691 --> 15:26.357
So how do you like that story?

15:26.359 --> 15:28.192
- It was good.

15:28.194 --> 15:29.594
- Yeah?

15:29.596 --> 15:31.095
[clears throat]

15:31.097 --> 15:33.498
So between, uh,
between that story

15:33.500 --> 15:36.301
And the one that mommy
read you last night,

15:36.303 --> 15:39.671
Which one...
Did you like...

15:39.673 --> 15:42.240
Better?

15:42.242 --> 15:43.241
- Better?

15:43.243 --> 15:46.511
- Yeah, between
clive and winky?

15:46.513 --> 15:48.146
- Winky.

15:48.148 --> 15:50.415
- Oh, yeah?

15:50.417 --> 15:52.050
Why?

15:52.052 --> 15:54.085
- Winky was funny.

15:54.087 --> 15:58.256
- How about that?

15:58.258 --> 16:00.124
And you like
winky the best?

16:02.328 --> 16:05.530
I love you.

16:08.167 --> 16:09.734
And...

16:09.736 --> 16:11.636
And you like the name winky,
right?

16:11.638 --> 16:13.271
- Yes.

16:13.273 --> 16:15.406
Oh!

16:21.613 --> 16:23.348
Hey.

16:23.350 --> 16:25.450
- Oh, you done already?

16:25.452 --> 16:27.018
- Yeah.

16:27.020 --> 16:28.586
- Yeah?
Well, is there a decision?

16:28.588 --> 16:30.288
- Yeah!

16:30.290 --> 16:34.425
- Mm-hmm?

16:34.427 --> 16:35.426
Well?

16:39.164 --> 16:41.766
- She picked yours.

16:41.768 --> 16:43.501
- Really?

16:43.503 --> 16:46.137
- Yeah, clive.

16:46.139 --> 16:49.107
Clive all the way.

16:49.109 --> 16:50.241
- No kidding?
- Yep.

16:50.243 --> 16:52.310
- She liked mine better.
- Yep.

16:52.312 --> 16:56.481
- Why are you lying to me?

16:56.483 --> 16:59.117
- What?
- You're lying to me.

16:59.119 --> 17:02.220
- You get that from "yep"?

17:02.222 --> 17:04.222
- No, I listened
outside of ally's door.

17:04.224 --> 17:05.690
- Why would you do that?

17:05.692 --> 17:07.291
- Because I knew
you would lie to me!

17:07.293 --> 17:09.727
- Oh, yeah, I lied,
but the nice way.

17:09.729 --> 17:11.529
- I don't need you
to protect my feelings, ray.

17:11.531 --> 17:13.264
Don't you think
I can handle it

17:13.266 --> 17:14.665
That I write
a children's story

17:14.667 --> 17:16.367
And my own daughter
doesn't even like it?

17:16.369 --> 17:18.069
- No, of course you can.

17:18.071 --> 17:19.103
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

17:19.105 --> 17:20.338
First, you win,
then you rob me

17:20.340 --> 17:22.206
Of the opportunity
to lose with dignity!

17:22.208 --> 17:25.076
- I think you lost that
when you listened at the door.

17:25.078 --> 17:26.444
- Fine, ray, fine.

17:26.446 --> 17:27.444
You know,
I try to do something

17:27.446 --> 17:29.080
To make me feel better
about myself,

17:29.082 --> 17:32.283
And I end up making you feel
better about yourself.

17:32.285 --> 17:36.054
- Thank you.

17:36.056 --> 17:37.188
Look, come on.

17:37.190 --> 17:38.623
You should feel better
about yourself.

17:38.625 --> 17:40.825
You came up with the whole idea
for the story.

17:40.827 --> 17:43.594
I just--I found a way
to make it work, that's all.

17:43.596 --> 17:45.263
- Yeah, great,
so I'm just the idea person.

17:45.265 --> 17:47.398
You're the guy that can
make it all happen.

17:47.400 --> 17:50.468
- Sometimes--sometimes
I'm just the idea person.

17:50.470 --> 17:52.170
Right?
Like with raising the kids.

17:52.172 --> 17:53.471
I think they should eat.

17:53.473 --> 17:56.240
You know how to feed them.

17:56.242 --> 17:58.242
Right?

17:58.244 --> 18:00.144
I think
they shouldn't be naked.

18:00.146 --> 18:03.281
You know what
to do there too, right?

18:03.283 --> 18:05.583
If it was up to me, they'd
be eatin' cereal every day

18:05.585 --> 18:08.586
And wearin' the boxes.

18:08.588 --> 18:10.254
- So great.
I'm a good mother.

18:10.256 --> 18:11.522
I knew that.

18:11.524 --> 18:16.194
I just--I wanted to do
something else.

18:16.196 --> 18:17.695
- You did.

18:17.697 --> 18:19.263
Look, you wanted
to write a children's book,

18:19.265 --> 18:20.298
And you wrote one.

18:20.300 --> 18:22.200
- Yeah, the loser one.

18:22.202 --> 18:24.368
- No, there's no losing.

18:24.370 --> 18:26.104
There wouldn't be
this stupid competition

18:26.106 --> 18:27.872
If you hadn't
asked me for help.

18:27.874 --> 18:29.774
You know what
ruined it for you?

18:29.776 --> 18:32.276
Me.

18:32.278 --> 18:35.680
- That's true.
- Yeah, it is.

18:35.682 --> 18:37.248
You could have
done this on your own.

18:37.250 --> 18:40.485
And I think I remember
asking you not to include me

18:40.487 --> 18:45.156
Five days ago,
remember,

18:45.158 --> 18:47.158
When you didn't hate me?

18:47.160 --> 18:49.894
- Yeah, that's true too.

18:49.896 --> 18:52.630
So I guess, if I want to get
something accomplished,

18:52.632 --> 18:59.604
I should just
stay away from you.

18:59.606 --> 19:00.838
- There you go.

19:00.840 --> 19:03.307
- Yeah, 'cause, like,
what was I thinking,

19:03.309 --> 19:04.675
Asking you to help me?

19:04.677 --> 19:06.511
- That's exactly, uh, right.

19:06.513 --> 19:09.213
- Yeah, because I do
like my story better.

19:09.215 --> 19:10.848
- You should.
It's good.

19:10.850 --> 19:14.318
- Yeah, but who cares
what you think, right?

19:14.320 --> 19:16.220
And ally probably only
liked your story better

19:16.222 --> 19:17.855
Because it's the last one
that she heard.

19:17.857 --> 19:21.159
[laughs]

19:21.161 --> 19:22.793
- I don't know...
I don't know about that.

19:22.795 --> 19:23.928
- Come on, I mean,

19:23.930 --> 19:26.230
You were
really selling your version.

19:26.232 --> 19:29.300
You were, like, makin' all
the goofy faces, weren't you?

19:29.302 --> 19:31.536
- You were outside the door.

19:31.538 --> 19:33.604
- And were you hoppin'
like a bunny too?

19:33.606 --> 19:36.407
- I was...
It served the story.

19:36.409 --> 19:37.275
- Yeah, yeah.
[laughing]

19:37.277 --> 19:40.912
Winky!

19:40.914 --> 19:43.681
[laughing] ray.

19:43.683 --> 19:46.884
- Winky doesn't hop
like a...Drunk.

19:55.761 --> 19:59.430
[in british accent]
'ello, clive.

19:59.432 --> 20:02.700
A spot o' ice cream?

20:02.702 --> 20:04.569
- You know,
that's not an accent, ray.

20:04.571 --> 20:08.306
That's a speech impediment.

20:08.308 --> 20:10.274
- Hey, raymond.
Thought I'd better warn you.

20:10.276 --> 20:11.809
Dad's on his way over
with his favorite portrait.

20:11.811 --> 20:13.377
- Oh, no.
Mom?

20:13.379 --> 20:15.279
- Hey, everybody.

20:15.281 --> 20:17.348
So you don't think
your old man's a painter, huh?

20:17.350 --> 20:18.349
- Dad, dad, dad, dad--

20:18.351 --> 20:20.251
- Look at this!

20:20.253 --> 20:22.954
The greatest bullfighter
of all time,

20:22.956 --> 20:25.756
"el cordobes."

20:25.758 --> 20:28.559
I found him on the back
of a king of spades.

20:28.561 --> 20:30.528
- That's really good, frank.

20:30.530 --> 20:31.729
- Yeah, nice.
- Oh, yeah!

20:31.731 --> 20:33.297
And here's one
of your mother.

20:33.299 --> 20:34.432
[all scream]
