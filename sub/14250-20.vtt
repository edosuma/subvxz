WEBVTT

00:07.300 --> 00:09.900
Let's mark the coordinates
of that trinary star.

00:10.001 --> 00:12.501
It'll be a good reference
point for this sector.

00:12.601 --> 00:16.602
Didn't we already pass
a trinary system like this?

00:16.702 --> 00:18.202
Not that I remember.
Why?

00:19.302 --> 00:20.803
It just seems familiar.

00:20.803 --> 00:22.203
Perhaps you're experiencing

00:22.203 --> 00:24.503
a paradoxical state-dependent
associative phenomenon.

00:26.604 --> 00:27.804
Deja vu.

00:29.604 --> 00:31.805
Yeah, I-I guess so.

00:31.905 --> 00:33.805
Captain, there is
a ship approaching,

00:33.905 --> 00:35.905
bearing 215 mark 8.

00:36.005 --> 00:37.506
On screen.

00:37.506 --> 00:38.606
Their shields are down

00:38.706 --> 00:40.706
and their weapon systems
are unpowered.

00:40.706 --> 00:42.106
They're hailing us.

00:43.307 --> 00:44.807
My respects to you.

00:44.807 --> 00:47.007
I'm Alben,
Captain of the Nerada

00:47.007 --> 00:50.508
Captain Kathryn Janeway of the
Federation Starship Voyager

00:50.508 --> 00:51.808
I thought I was familiar

00:51.808 --> 00:53.509
with every type of ship
in this sector,

00:53.509 --> 00:55.609
but I've never seen
anything like yours before.

00:55.609 --> 00:57.709
We're not from around here.

00:57.809 --> 01:00.010
In that case, let me welcome you
to Nasari territory.

01:00.010 --> 01:02.010
That ship's going to fire.

01:02.110 --> 01:03.110
What?

01:03.210 --> 01:05.111
Captain, we've got
to defend ourselves.

01:05.211 --> 01:07.011
I am detecting no threat.

01:07.011 --> 01:08.811
Tactical control

01:08.811 --> 01:11.012
has been routed
to the Ops station.

01:11.112 --> 01:12.712
Our weapon systems are charging.

01:12.712 --> 01:14.713
Raising shields
and firing phasers.

01:19.213 --> 01:20.214
Direct hit.

01:20.314 --> 01:21.514
They are returning fire.

01:21.514 --> 01:23.314
Red Alert.

01:25.000 --> 01:31.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:17.835 --> 03:18.836
Hall them.

03:18.836 --> 03:20.336
We've got to put
a stop to this.

03:20.336 --> 03:22.336
Captain, I had to act quickly.

03:22.336 --> 03:23.536
You will explain yourself,
Mr. Kim,

03:23.536 --> 03:24.537
but right now, you're relieved.

03:24.637 --> 03:25.637
Commander, you're at Ops.

03:27.137 --> 03:29.638
They are not
responding to halls.

03:31.238 --> 03:34.438
There's pressure building up
in Plasma Conduit G-6.

03:34.438 --> 03:36.439
Ashmore, open up
the emergency vents.

03:36.539 --> 03:38.539
I'll try to reroute
the plasma flow.

03:38.539 --> 03:40.140
Shields are down to 70 percent.

03:41.340 --> 03:42.740
Get us out of here.

03:42.740 --> 03:44.040
Warp engines are down.

03:44.140 --> 03:45.541
They are in pursuit.

03:45.541 --> 03:47.041
Bridge to Engineering.
What's the status

03:47.041 --> 03:48.141
of the warp drive?

03:48.141 --> 03:49.741
The plasma injectors
are off-line, Cap...

03:50.942 --> 03:52.142
We're working on them now.

03:53.142 --> 03:56.343
A plasma conduit
just blew in Engineering.

03:56.343 --> 03:58.743
Propulsion systems are down.

03:58.743 --> 04:00.543
They're reporting casualties.

04:00.543 --> 04:03.544
Target their weapons
array and fire.

04:08.545 --> 04:10.545
They've suffered damage
to their weapon systems

04:10.545 --> 04:11.845
and shield emitters.

04:11.945 --> 04:13.646
They are moving away.

04:18.747 --> 04:21.846
I want to know exactly
what you thought you were doing.

04:21.846 --> 04:22.847
Their weapons were charging.

04:22.847 --> 04:23.948
They were about to fire at us.

04:23.948 --> 04:24.948
We could have been destroyed.

04:24.948 --> 04:26.048
Sensor logs indicate

04:26.148 --> 04:29.149
that their weapon systems
were not powered.

04:29.149 --> 04:31.749
Then they must have fooled
our sensors somehow.

04:31.849 --> 04:34.050
I detected a tetryon surge
coming from their ship.

04:34.150 --> 04:37.650
There are many possible sources
of increased tetryon emissions.

04:37.750 --> 04:40.551
It may have been an irregularity
in their warp field.

04:40.551 --> 04:41.951
No.

04:41.951 --> 04:43.851
It was their weapons.

04:43.851 --> 04:46.052
That whole ''welcome to Nasari
territory'' was a trick.

04:46.152 --> 04:47.452
How could you know that?

04:51.453 --> 04:53.553
I can't explain that.

04:53.653 --> 04:55.754
I just knew.

04:55.854 --> 04:57.754
I was only trying
to protect the ship.

04:57.854 --> 04:59.654
I trust your intentions, Ensign,

04:59.654 --> 05:00.955
but your actions
are going to need

05:01.055 --> 05:02.155
a little more justification.

05:02.155 --> 05:04.355
I want you to analyze
the sensor logs

05:04.455 --> 05:06.656
and see if there's any basis
for Mr. Kim's hunch.

05:06.756 --> 05:07.756
Aye, Captain.

05:07.756 --> 05:10.956
In the meantime,
I'm suspending you from duty.

05:11.056 --> 05:12.757
Go to Sick Bay.

05:12.757 --> 05:14.957
Let the Doctor have
a look at that cut.

05:27.759 --> 05:29.160
Still no respiration.

05:29.160 --> 05:31.060
Her blood pressure is
90/40 and dropping.

05:31.060 --> 05:33.060
She has second-degree
burns on her lungs.

05:33.060 --> 05:35.361
I'll need to do
a pulmonary regeneration.

05:35.361 --> 05:37.261
Her neural tissues are
starting to degenerating.

05:37.361 --> 05:39.162
Oxygen deprivation--
we've got to get her breathing.

05:39.162 --> 05:40.862
Try ten milligrams pulmozine.

05:45.363 --> 05:46.663
No effect.

05:46.663 --> 05:48.063
20 milligrams.

05:53.364 --> 05:54.965
Is she going to be all right?

05:54.965 --> 05:56.265
Yes.

05:56.265 --> 05:58.965
Another patient snatched
from the jaws of death.

06:04.466 --> 06:06.367
Let me take care of that.

06:06.467 --> 06:08.667
B'Elanna almost got killed.

06:08.667 --> 06:09.967
It's my fault.

06:10.067 --> 06:11.168
What do you mean?

06:11.268 --> 06:12.968
I started that fight.

06:12.968 --> 06:15.968
I thought I was doing
the right thing.

06:15.968 --> 06:18.569
For a moment,
I was absolutely sure.

06:18.669 --> 06:20.069
And now you're not?

06:21.569 --> 06:22.870
It's fading.

06:22.870 --> 06:27.171
What I did and how I felt--
it doesn't make any sense.

06:27.271 --> 06:28.671
And it could have been worse.

06:28.671 --> 06:31.071
What if they'd been
more powerful than we were?

06:31.071 --> 06:32.672
I could have
gotten everyone killed.

06:32.772 --> 06:33.772
But none of that happened.

06:33.872 --> 06:36.172
B'Elanna got hurt,
and she'll recover.

06:36.272 --> 06:40.073
Harry, you can't undo
what's been done.

06:41.073 --> 06:42.673
You're right.

06:44.174 --> 06:45.674
Thanks.

06:59.076 --> 07:01.977
Raising shields
and firing phasers.

07:05.078 --> 07:06.478
I can't explain it;
I just knew.

07:06.578 --> 07:08.578
I never wanted you to get hurt.

07:08.578 --> 07:10.779
That's supposed to make me
feel better?

07:10.879 --> 07:11.979
I'm sorry.

07:12.079 --> 07:14.779
Harry, I'm here.

07:14.779 --> 07:16.980
Don't worry.

07:17.080 --> 07:18.980
You'll feel better soon.

07:19.080 --> 07:21.881
I can make some soup for you.

07:21.881 --> 07:23.481
Would you like that?

07:25.581 --> 07:30.382
I won't go anywhere
as long as you need me.

07:30.482 --> 07:33.783
We raised you to be
a responsible boy.

07:33.783 --> 07:35.083
I try to be.

07:35.083 --> 07:37.584
I'm suspending you from duty.

07:37.684 --> 07:38.284
Mom...

08:05.189 --> 08:07.289
Well, the good news is
I won't have to quarantine you.

08:07.289 --> 08:09.690
There's no sign of an infectious
agent anywhere in your body.

08:09.690 --> 08:11.490
And the bad news?

08:11.590 --> 08:13.790
If I don't find
the cause of this rash,

08:13.790 --> 08:15.891
it will be difficult to treat.

08:15.991 --> 08:18.891
Last night, I had a dream
about being sick

08:18.891 --> 08:20.892
with the Mendakan pox
when I was nine.

08:20.892 --> 08:23.092
Do you think this
could be a recurrence?

08:23.092 --> 08:28.393
I've never considered dreams
as a diagnostic tool before.

08:28.393 --> 08:32.894
Your unconscious mind
sensed these developing symptoms

08:32.894 --> 08:35.394
and tried to provide
an explanation?

08:35.394 --> 08:38.495
Hmm. Such recurrences of this
particular illness are rare,

08:38.495 --> 08:41.495
but I will consider
the possibility.

08:41.495 --> 08:43.596
Hmm.

08:43.596 --> 08:44.996
What?

08:44.996 --> 08:46.796
In addition
to your visible symptoms,

08:46.796 --> 08:48.797
your blood chemistry
has been slightly altered.

08:48.897 --> 08:49.797
Is that serious?

08:49.897 --> 08:51.397
No, but it's not consistent

08:51.397 --> 08:53.998
with the symptoms
of the Mendakan pox.

08:53.998 --> 08:58.599
Doctor, you don't think
there could be any, uh...

08:58.699 --> 09:01.099
psychological effects
from this disease, do you?

09:01.099 --> 09:02.899
Such as?

09:04.000 --> 09:07.100
I've been having this
strange d?j? vu feeling.

09:07.100 --> 09:11.401
Then yesterday on the Bridge,
I had this sudden instinct

09:11.501 --> 09:14.001
and I acted on it
by firing without orders.

09:14.001 --> 09:16.802
I'd certainly call that
atypical behavior.

09:16.902 --> 09:20.303
Your scans haven't shown
any neurological abnormalities,

09:20.303 --> 09:22.803
but I will run
a closer analysis.

09:22.903 --> 09:25.704
Doctor, she's
regaining consciousness.

09:28.404 --> 09:29.904
Good morning, Lieutenant.

09:30.705 --> 09:32.605
Morning?

09:32.605 --> 09:35.005
What am I doing here?

09:35.005 --> 09:36.806
There was an accident
in Engineering.

09:36.906 --> 09:38.206
A plasma conduit exploded.

09:38.306 --> 09:40.506
I've treated you for second
and third degree burns

09:40.506 --> 09:41.907
and several broken ribs.

09:42.007 --> 09:43.407
I expect you'll make
a full recovery.

09:45.107 --> 09:46.908
After you've spent at least
one more day in Sick Bay.

09:48.608 --> 09:51.508
This time, Doctor,
I'm not going to argue with you.

09:58.110 --> 10:00.010
Harry.

10:00.110 --> 10:02.410
What happened to your face?

10:02.410 --> 10:04.311
We're still trying
to figure that out.

10:04.311 --> 10:05.611
It's kind of cute.

10:05.611 --> 10:08.112
Makes you look like
a speckled targ

10:10.312 --> 10:13.112
B'Elanna...

10:13.112 --> 10:15.213
I'm really sorry you got hurt.

10:15.313 --> 10:17.213
Hey, it's all part

10:17.213 --> 10:19.614
of the adventure
of space travel, right?

10:19.614 --> 10:21.614
I know, but, um...

10:23.614 --> 10:25.115
What? What is it?

10:26.315 --> 10:27.915
Never mind.

10:28.015 --> 10:30.116
I'm glad you're going
to be all right.

10:30.216 --> 10:32.416
Thanks.

10:32.516 --> 10:35.217
I'm afraid I'm going to have
to cut visiting hours short.

10:35.317 --> 10:36.517
Ensign, you can go.

10:36.617 --> 10:39.517
I'll contact you
with the results of my analysis.

10:39.617 --> 10:41.018
Take care of yourself.

10:42.318 --> 10:44.118
See you later, Spot.

10:56.320 --> 10:57.521
Captain.

10:57.521 --> 11:00.121
I accept full responsibility
for my mistake.

11:00.221 --> 11:01.821
I was completely out of line

11:01.821 --> 11:03.922
even if I believed that other
ship was charging weapons,

11:03.922 --> 11:05.022
which they probably weren't.

11:05.022 --> 11:07.122
Harry,

11:07.222 --> 11:09.523
they were charging weapons.

11:11.123 --> 11:12.223
I was right.

11:12.323 --> 11:14.224
Tuvok has confirmed
that the tetryon surge

11:14.224 --> 11:16.124
matched the energy signature

11:16.124 --> 11:18.825
of that particulate beam
they shot at us.

11:18.825 --> 11:21.425
They would have taken us
completely by surprise.

11:21.525 --> 11:24.526
As soon as I saw their ship,

11:24.526 --> 11:27.226
I felt this sudden...

11:27.326 --> 11:29.927
suspicion and loathing.

11:29.927 --> 11:32.027
I knew we were in trouble.

11:32.027 --> 11:34.528
Which brings us back
to the larger question.

11:34.628 --> 11:36.828
How did I know?

11:39.929 --> 11:42.929
I really wish I could
tell you, Captain, but...

11:42.929 --> 11:44.929
for the past few days,
this area of space

11:45.030 --> 11:47.030
has seemed more and more
familiar to me.

11:47.030 --> 11:49.230
If I didn't know
it was impossible,

11:49.330 --> 11:51.231
I'd swear I've been here before.

11:51.231 --> 11:54.131
We'll have to consider
every possible explanation.

11:54.231 --> 11:56.132
Oh, believe me, I have been--

11:56.132 --> 11:58.432
space-time anomalies,

11:58.432 --> 12:01.433
alien telepathy,
alternate reallties...

12:01.433 --> 12:04.133
The list gets weirder
as it goes on.

12:05.433 --> 12:07.934
Then there's
your sudden illness,

12:07.934 --> 12:10.334
which may not be a coincidence.

12:10.334 --> 12:11.634
Tuvok to Janeway.

12:11.734 --> 12:13.135
There are three ships
approaching

12:13.235 --> 12:15.535
of the same configuration
as the Nasari vessel.

12:15.535 --> 12:17.135
On my way.

12:19.736 --> 12:21.536
They'll intercept in 36 minutes.

12:21.636 --> 12:22.737
Can we outrun them?

12:22.737 --> 12:23.737
I doubt it.

12:23.737 --> 12:25.037
Engineering's still
working on repairs.

12:25.137 --> 12:26.537
We could manage warp 3 at best.

12:28.338 --> 12:30.738
Let me see a star chart
of this region.

12:34.539 --> 12:36.139
Head for this system.

12:36.139 --> 12:37.839
I think we can make it.

12:37.839 --> 12:40.140
Is this another hunch, Ensign?

12:42.640 --> 12:44.441
We'll be safe there.
I'm sure of it.

12:47.041 --> 12:49.441
Tactical status.

12:49.541 --> 12:51.242
The aft shield emitter
is off-line.

12:51.342 --> 12:54.842
Phasers are operational, but
torpedo launchers are not.

12:54.842 --> 12:57.643
I strongly advise
against a confrontation.

13:01.744 --> 13:03.144
Follow Harry's course.

13:03.144 --> 13:06.345
Speed-- as fast as we can go.

13:18.247 --> 13:21.647
The Nasari vessels
will overtake us in two minutes.

13:21.747 --> 13:24.348
We're coming up
on that star system.

13:26.248 --> 13:28.649
We'll pass it
if we stay at warp.

13:28.649 --> 13:30.349
Slow to impulse.

13:30.349 --> 13:32.549
We're making our stand here.

13:33.850 --> 13:36.050
They'll enter weapons range
in a few seconds.

13:43.351 --> 13:44.952
Taresia.

13:45.952 --> 13:47.352
What does that mean?

13:47.452 --> 13:49.253
Do you know this place?

13:49.353 --> 13:50.853
Yes.

13:50.953 --> 13:52.053
It was in my dream.

13:52.153 --> 13:53.853
There is
another ship approaching.

13:53.853 --> 13:54.854
from the third planet.

13:54.854 --> 13:55.754
Is it Nasari?

13:55.754 --> 13:57.954
No, but they're
on an intercept course

13:58.054 --> 14:00.155
and their weapons
are fully powered.

14:00.255 --> 14:02.455
Prepare for evasive maneuvers.

14:02.455 --> 14:03.555
Aye, Captain.

14:03.555 --> 14:04.555
We'll be all right.

14:14.257 --> 14:15.457
The unidentified vessel

14:15.457 --> 14:17.158
has disabled
all the Nasari ships.

14:17.258 --> 14:18.658
They are retreating.

14:18.758 --> 14:21.258
What's your next trick, Harry--

14:21.359 --> 14:23.159
pull a shuttlecraft
out of a hat?

14:24.459 --> 14:26.059
Open a channel to that ship.

14:26.159 --> 14:28.460
They're already haling us.

14:28.460 --> 14:29.860
Allen vessel.

14:29.960 --> 14:32.261
This is the Taresian starship.

14:32.361 --> 14:34.161
There you are.

14:34.161 --> 14:36.961
Our sensors detected you
aboard your ship.

14:36.961 --> 14:39.062
I'm glad to see you're safe.

14:39.062 --> 14:40.462
Do you know me?

14:40.462 --> 14:41.462
In a way.

14:41.462 --> 14:43.563
I know you are one of my people.

14:43.563 --> 14:45.363
What?!

14:45.363 --> 14:47.163
You are Taresian.

14:47.163 --> 14:49.464
Welcome home.

14:58.265 --> 15:02.066
Captain's Log, Stardate 50732.4.

15:02.166 --> 15:04.967
The Taresians have escorted us
back to their homeworld

15:05.067 --> 15:07.467
so we can continue
to investigate their claim

15:07.567 --> 15:10.868
that Ensign Kim
is a member of their race.

15:15.068 --> 15:15.969
Welcome.

15:16.069 --> 15:18.069
We're so glad to have you here.

15:18.069 --> 15:20.770
This is a day of celebration.

15:20.770 --> 15:22.970
Another Taresian has returned.

15:23.070 --> 15:23.970
Welcome.

15:24.070 --> 15:25.670
You're home now, Harry.

15:26.971 --> 15:27.971
Uh, wait a minute.

15:27.971 --> 15:30.371
I still don't understand
how this is possible.

15:30.471 --> 15:33.072
We'd like to ask some questions
before we start celebrating.

15:33.072 --> 15:34.172
Of course.

15:34.172 --> 15:37.173
Our Doctor has found
some genetic fragments in my DNA

15:37.173 --> 15:40.073
which could be part
of an alien genetic structure.

15:40.073 --> 15:42.874
Yes, those are
your Taresian genes.

15:42.874 --> 15:44.774
They're becoming active.

15:44.774 --> 15:46.774
We'd be happy
to provide your Doctor

15:46.774 --> 15:49.575
with some DNA samples
for comparison.

15:49.575 --> 15:51.475
What I want to know is
how I could have gotten them.

15:51.475 --> 15:55.476
You were conceived here,
on this world.

15:55.576 --> 15:57.476
While you were still an embryo,

15:57.476 --> 16:00.177
you were placed in stasis
and taken to Earth

16:00.177 --> 16:02.877
to be implanted in the womb
of an Earth woman.

16:02.977 --> 16:04.078
My mother.

16:04.078 --> 16:05.378
What did you do to her?

16:05.478 --> 16:06.378
She would have been

16:06.478 --> 16:08.778
completely unaware
of the procedure.

16:08.778 --> 16:12.579
After the implantation process,
the child begins to incorporate

16:12.679 --> 16:15.380
some DNA
from the surrogate parent.

16:15.380 --> 16:17.880
You developed physically
as a human,

16:17.980 --> 16:20.881
so she would have thought
you were her natural child.

16:20.981 --> 16:22.681
But you're saying I'm not.

16:22.681 --> 16:25.582
We understand how you feel.

16:25.682 --> 16:28.082
Everyone here was born
on other worlds.

16:28.082 --> 16:30.182
We all found our way
back home, like you,

16:30.282 --> 16:34.083
and discovered we're not quite
who we thought we were.

16:34.083 --> 16:36.184
Harry, maybe you'd
like to sit down.

16:36.184 --> 16:38.284
Why don't you go get him
something to drink?

16:40.484 --> 16:43.385
All of your children are
born to alien parents?

16:43.485 --> 16:44.585
Yes.

16:44.685 --> 16:47.186
And when they return,
each child brings an infusion

16:47.286 --> 16:50.586
of new genetic material,
as well as years

16:50.686 --> 16:52.887
of firsthand experience
about another culture.

16:52.987 --> 16:55.287
But Harry wasn't trying
to return here.

16:55.287 --> 16:57.888
We came to the Delta Quadrant
by accident.

16:57.988 --> 17:01.088
His DNA was encoded
with certain instincts,

17:01.088 --> 17:03.889
including the desire
to explore space.

17:03.889 --> 17:07.789
Your ''accident'' may have
brought him here faster,

17:07.789 --> 17:11.990
but he always would have been
driven to find his way back.

17:12.089 --> 17:17.491
You are the first to return
from such a great distance.

17:19.791 --> 17:21.692
Harry...

17:25.193 --> 17:27.593
That's how Taresians say
thank you, isn't it?

17:30.794 --> 17:33.594
But how could I know so much
about a place I've never been?

17:33.594 --> 17:36.095
It's been coded
into your Taresian genes.

17:36.095 --> 17:37.495
As you've gotten closer to home

17:37.495 --> 17:39.995
and seen familiar sights,
your dormant genetic memory

17:39.995 --> 17:42.096
has been reawakened.

17:42.196 --> 17:44.596
You'll remember more about us
as you spend time here.

17:44.696 --> 17:47.997
I know it all seems strange now,
but you are one of us, Harry.

17:47.997 --> 17:49.697
Can't you feel it?

17:52.498 --> 17:54.098
Yes.

17:54.098 --> 17:56.698
I can.

17:56.799 --> 17:59.199
Then stay with us a while
and celebrate.

17:59.299 --> 18:01.199
Come, have something to eat.

18:07.500 --> 18:10.401
Is this the standard
welcome home reception?

18:10.501 --> 18:12.301
For males, it is.

18:12.401 --> 18:14.102
They're very rare.

18:14.202 --> 18:17.802
Our population is
90 percent female.

18:17.902 --> 18:19.703
Really?

18:20.803 --> 18:21.703
I want to thank you again

18:21.803 --> 18:24.104
for your help
in combating the Nasari.

18:24.104 --> 18:26.904
Do you have any idea
why they tried to attack us?

18:26.904 --> 18:28.804
They probably detected
a Taresian

18:28.904 --> 18:30.405
aboard your ship,
as we did.

18:30.505 --> 18:33.405
For the Nasari, that's
reason enough to destroy you.

18:33.405 --> 18:35.006
Are your people at war?

18:35.106 --> 18:36.906
We have no interest
in fighting with them,

18:36.906 --> 18:39.406
but they seem determined
to destroy us.

18:39.406 --> 18:42.907
Our defense capabilities prevent
them from attacking directly,

18:43.007 --> 18:44.407
but they do
everything in their power

18:44.407 --> 18:46.608
to stop our people
from returning home.

18:46.608 --> 18:48.008
I see.

18:48.008 --> 18:49.108
That might explain

18:49.208 --> 18:51.209
Mr. Kim's instinctively
hostile reaction to them.

18:51.309 --> 18:52.409
It's a defense

18:52.409 --> 18:55.109
mechanism we've programmed
into all our children.

18:55.209 --> 18:57.110
Are the Nasari likely
to attack us again

18:57.110 --> 18:58.410
when we leave your space?

18:58.410 --> 19:01.511
I think eventually they'll tire
of waiting for you to come out.

19:01.511 --> 19:05.511
In the meantime, I'd advise you
to simply stay here for a while.

19:08.812 --> 19:11.412
These are words.

19:11.512 --> 19:12.513
Mm-hmm.
Can you read them?

19:12.613 --> 19:13.613
Almost.

19:13.613 --> 19:16.413
Our written language
is very complicated.

19:16.413 --> 19:19.514
I can teach it to you
if you're interested.

19:19.514 --> 19:20.514
Oh, that looks good.

19:20.514 --> 19:21.514
What is it?

19:21.514 --> 19:22.614
Spiced hatana

19:22.714 --> 19:24.315
I prepared it myself.

19:24.315 --> 19:26.115
Harry, try some.

19:28.115 --> 19:30.416
I'd like to find out
if I have any relatives here.

19:30.416 --> 19:32.816
Maybe talk
to my biological parents.

19:34.117 --> 19:37.517
I'm afraid none of us get the
chance to meet our fathers.

19:37.517 --> 19:39.518
They're the ones who take
the embryos to other worlds.

19:39.618 --> 19:40.718
Your father must have left here

19:40.718 --> 19:42.218
a very long time ago
to make it all the way

19:42.218 --> 19:44.318
to the Alpha Quadrant.

19:44.418 --> 19:46.419
Ensign, we're transporting
back to the ship.

19:49.419 --> 19:51.220
I'd like to stay for a while.

19:51.220 --> 19:52.820
I still have a lot of questions.

19:52.820 --> 19:54.220
Of course, Harry.

19:54.220 --> 19:56.021
Contact us when you're ready.

19:56.021 --> 19:58.021
We'll see you later.

20:06.022 --> 20:07.623
It's a positive match.

20:07.623 --> 20:10.923
These genetic fragments
within Ensign Kim's DNA

20:11.023 --> 20:12.224
are clearly Taresian.

20:12.324 --> 20:14.724
Why haven't they shown up
in his medical scans before?

20:14.824 --> 20:16.724
I went back and checked
his scans carefully.

20:16.824 --> 20:18.725
These fragments have apparently
been disguising themselves

20:18.825 --> 20:21.225
as the recessive elements
which normally exist

20:21.225 --> 20:23.526
within all DNA,
but over the past few days,

20:23.526 --> 20:25.026
they've become
increasingly dominant

20:25.026 --> 20:26.526
over his human genes.

20:26.526 --> 20:28.727
And they provided him
with new knowledge.

20:28.827 --> 20:32.127
Yes, by forming neural
connections in his brain.

20:32.127 --> 20:33.628
All humanoid babies are born

20:33.628 --> 20:35.428
with certain
instinctive knowledge--

20:35.528 --> 20:37.028
how to recognize
the shape of a face,

20:37.028 --> 20:38.529
how to hold their
breath underwater.

20:38.629 --> 20:40.029
It all comes from their genes.

20:40.029 --> 20:42.629
The Taresians must have
found a way to manipulate

20:42.729 --> 20:44.230
genetic material to implant

20:44.230 --> 20:46.630
very specific knowledge
into their children.

20:46.630 --> 20:48.130
It's scientifically plausible,

20:48.130 --> 20:50.231
but quite a feat
of genetic engineering.

20:50.231 --> 20:52.031
So what the Taresians
have been telling us

20:52.031 --> 20:53.031
appears to be true.

20:53.031 --> 20:55.632
Harry is one of their people.

20:55.632 --> 20:58.132
And he's becoming more like them
every day, both physically

20:58.132 --> 20:59.832
and neurologically.

20:59.832 --> 21:01.433
I wonder how that's
going to influence him

21:01.433 --> 21:03.233
when Voyager's ready to leave?

21:03.333 --> 21:05.233
Of course,
when that might happen

21:05.333 --> 21:07.034
is another question entirely.

21:07.134 --> 21:08.634
Are the Nasari still out there?

21:08.734 --> 21:10.234
All three ships
are holding position

21:10.234 --> 21:12.235
just outside
the Taresian system.

21:12.235 --> 21:14.235
Even if we can't wait them out,

21:14.335 --> 21:16.536
we may only be postponing
another conflict.

21:16.536 --> 21:17.636
I'd much rather find a way

21:17.736 --> 21:19.436
to convince them
we're not their enemies.

21:19.536 --> 21:23.337
Apparently, the Nasari only
consider Ensign Kim their enemy.

21:23.337 --> 21:24.837
Perhaps they would
be more receptive

21:24.937 --> 21:27.038
to diplomacy
if he were not aboard.

21:27.038 --> 21:28.238
Contact Harry.

21:28.238 --> 21:29.938
Let him know
we'll be leaving orbit.

21:29.938 --> 21:31.938
With any luck, we'll
be back in a few hours

21:31.938 --> 21:33.839
with this matter resolved.

21:38.040 --> 21:40.040
I joined the merchant fleet
so I could get into space

21:40.140 --> 21:43.141
because I wanted to explore
every corner of the galaxy.

21:43.141 --> 21:45.741
Like me with Starfleet.

21:45.841 --> 21:48.341
All my life that's
all I ever wanted to do.

21:48.441 --> 21:50.642
Now I guess I know why.

21:50.642 --> 21:53.642
Strange to think
that some alien DNA fragments

21:53.742 --> 21:55.243
have been controlling my life.

21:55.243 --> 21:56.643
Not controlling.

21:56.643 --> 21:58.343
Influencing, yes.

21:58.443 --> 22:00.044
You probably inherited
some Taresian traits

22:00.044 --> 22:03.244
like... a talent
for math or music.

22:03.244 --> 22:07.245
Yes. I always wondered
why I loved music so much

22:07.345 --> 22:10.246
when my parents--
my human parents--

22:10.346 --> 22:12.246
were practically tone deaf.

22:12.346 --> 22:14.246
Wait. Wait a minute.
What is that?

22:14.346 --> 22:15.947
Something to make you feel good.

22:15.947 --> 22:18.947
It's just a mild mood enhancer.

22:18.947 --> 22:21.648
No side effects.

22:21.648 --> 22:23.448
You'll like it.

22:23.548 --> 22:25.648
I think I'll pass.
Thanks.

22:25.648 --> 22:28.249
This is Malla.

22:28.349 --> 22:30.249
She's going to be my first wife.

22:30.449 --> 22:31.349
First?

22:31.449 --> 22:32.450
Uh-huh.

22:32.450 --> 22:34.650
You're already planning
on a second?

22:34.650 --> 22:35.950
And a third.

22:36.050 --> 22:38.251
We'll all be joined
with Taymon tonight.

22:38.351 --> 22:42.151
What do humans call it
when a man and women are joined?

22:42.151 --> 22:43.652
It's called marriage.

22:43.652 --> 22:46.052
But it's usually
one woman with one man.

22:46.052 --> 22:47.953
How unusual.

22:47.953 --> 22:51.353
I hope you come to our ceremony.

22:51.353 --> 22:53.053
I wouldn't miss it.

22:57.254 --> 22:59.955
Don't be afraid to indulge
yourself, Harry.

23:00.055 --> 23:02.455
Everybody here wants
you to be happy.

23:02.455 --> 23:05.056
You're important to us.

23:05.156 --> 23:08.556
That's what my human parents
used to say to me--

23:08.556 --> 23:10.557
how special I was.

23:10.657 --> 23:13.557
They'd been trying
to have a baby for years

23:13.557 --> 23:14.958
until I came along.

23:14.958 --> 23:18.858
They called me
their ''miracle child.''

23:18.958 --> 23:20.259
They were right.

23:21.859 --> 23:24.859
They spoiled me rotten,
making sacrifices

23:24.959 --> 23:27.460
so they could give me
everything I wanted.

23:27.460 --> 23:29.060
Sounds like you
were pretty lucky.

23:29.060 --> 23:30.260
They loved you.

23:30.360 --> 23:33.961
But I never felt like I deserved
that kind of devotion.

23:34.061 --> 23:37.462
I didn't see what was
so special about me.

23:40.262 --> 23:44.163
I used to imagine that I
had these hidden powers.

23:44.163 --> 23:46.663
I'd grow up to be
stronger than a Klingon

23:46.663 --> 23:48.464
or able to read people's minds.

23:48.564 --> 23:51.764
Anything to make me more
than just an average kid.

23:51.864 --> 23:53.765
Turns out your parents
were right about you.

23:53.765 --> 23:57.465
You have been special,
all of your life.

23:57.465 --> 24:00.466
Feels pretty good, doesn't it?

24:00.466 --> 24:02.666
Yeah.

24:02.766 --> 24:04.267
It does.

24:04.367 --> 24:07.667
Mmm... let me relax
your muscles for you.

24:09.968 --> 24:11.768
Uh, that would be great.

24:14.469 --> 24:17.669
I think you're going to learn
to like it here, Harry.

24:17.669 --> 24:19.169
I already like it.

24:19.169 --> 24:21.470
Enough to stay?

24:21.570 --> 24:24.570
I don't know about that.

24:24.570 --> 24:27.671
I'm happy where I am,
on Voyager

24:27.671 --> 24:30.772
You could be happy here, too.

24:30.772 --> 24:33.472
It's nothing you have
to decide right now.

24:33.472 --> 24:35.573
Just enjoy yourself

24:35.673 --> 24:37.173
while you're here.

24:38.973 --> 24:42.674
This uniform seems
so restrictive.

24:42.674 --> 24:44.474
Why don't you let me

24:44.474 --> 24:46.475
find you something
more comfortable?

24:46.475 --> 24:48.775
Thanks.

24:48.875 --> 24:49.875
I mean...

24:59.377 --> 25:01.177
I agree
with you completeIy, Captain.

25:01.177 --> 25:04.178
There's no reason for further
hostility between us.

25:04.278 --> 25:05.178
I'm glad to hear it

25:05.278 --> 25:06.878
and I hope you'll
still feel that way

25:06.878 --> 25:08.379
when Ensign Kim
is back on board.

25:08.379 --> 25:10.679
I doubt we'll face that problem.

25:10.679 --> 25:13.079
Your crew member
won't be returning to you.

25:13.179 --> 25:15.080
What do you mean?

25:15.180 --> 25:17.880
No one who ''comes home''
to Taresia ever leaves again.

25:17.980 --> 25:20.381
There are rumors
about those people.

25:20.381 --> 25:22.381
I'm not interested in hearsay.

25:22.481 --> 25:24.182
Are there any facts
you can give me?

25:24.282 --> 25:26.582
I fire on any Taresian I see.

25:26.682 --> 25:28.182
If you take
your crew member back on board,

25:28.282 --> 25:29.583
I will attack your ship!

25:29.583 --> 25:31.883
My best advice to you

25:31.883 --> 25:35.284
is to forget him,
and be on your way.

25:35.984 --> 25:37.384
Do you think
there's any truth

25:37.484 --> 25:38.884
to those rumors he mentioned?

25:38.884 --> 25:40.585
I don't know,
but I'll feel better

25:40.585 --> 25:42.485
when we've got Harry back.

25:42.485 --> 25:43.985
Set a course back to the planet.

25:49.986 --> 25:53.187
Captain, sensors indicate
a high-density polaron grid

25:53.287 --> 25:54.587
surrounding the planet.

25:54.587 --> 25:56.588
A polaron grid?
It wasn't here before.

25:56.688 --> 25:59.488
A network of satellites
was activated to generate it.

25:59.588 --> 26:00.488
Can we get through the grid?

26:00.588 --> 26:03.589
Unlikely.
The polaric density is too high.

26:03.689 --> 26:05.289
Hall them.

26:05.289 --> 26:07.590
Our communications
are being blocked.

26:10.790 --> 26:12.891
I guess we're
not welcome anymore.

26:41.096 --> 26:42.296
Don't worry.

26:42.396 --> 26:44.596
You'll remember
everything you need to know

26:44.596 --> 26:47.097
about the ceremony
once it begins.

27:01.600 --> 27:03.100
Amal ulat

27:03.200 --> 27:04.700
Let us be joined.

27:48.908 --> 27:51.009
The joining is complete.

28:08.612 --> 28:10.912
Why do they tie him like that?

28:11.013 --> 28:13.313
It's tradition.

28:13.413 --> 28:15.613
It symbolizes binding
their lives together,

28:15.713 --> 28:17.514
no longer looking
for anyone else.

28:17.514 --> 28:20.014
Do you find it exciting?

28:21.815 --> 28:24.415
I guess I hadn't really
thought of it that way.

28:26.115 --> 28:28.316
You are going to stay
for the celebration, aren't you?

28:28.416 --> 28:31.616
Actually, I should check in
with Voyager

28:31.616 --> 28:33.317
They're probably back by now.

28:38.818 --> 28:40.818
Kim to Voyager

28:42.918 --> 28:44.819
This is Ensign Kim
calling Voyager

28:44.919 --> 28:45.819
Do you read?

28:49.320 --> 28:52.720
Harry... I'm glad you
could be here for this.

28:52.820 --> 28:54.521
It's been interesting.

28:54.621 --> 28:57.221
I was wondering if there's
been any word from Voyager

28:57.321 --> 28:59.321
Not that I know of.

28:59.321 --> 29:01.722
They probably
haven't returned yet.

29:01.822 --> 29:02.922
It's been a long time.

29:02.922 --> 29:05.423
I hope they didn't run
into trouble with the Nasari.

29:05.523 --> 29:07.123
Oh, try not to worry.

29:07.123 --> 29:08.923
Your Captain may need some time

29:08.923 --> 29:11.324
to convince those people
to see reason.

29:11.424 --> 29:13.924
Hmm, maybe so.

29:14.024 --> 29:17.325
Come... join the
celebration while you wait.

29:17.425 --> 29:20.825
And of course you're
welcome to stay the night.

29:26.727 --> 29:27.827
We've been able
to poke some holes

29:27.927 --> 29:29.027
in the tachyon grid,

29:29.127 --> 29:30.727
but they're too small
to squeeze Voyager through.

29:30.727 --> 29:31.928
Could a shuttle make it?

29:31.928 --> 29:34.528
I doubt it, and even if one
could, there's another problem--

29:34.628 --> 29:37.229
a Taresian ship is patrolling
the other side of the grid.

29:37.329 --> 29:39.029
And we saw what they can do.

29:39.029 --> 29:41.129
Ah, Captain, when you
raised some concerns

29:41.229 --> 29:42.429
regarding the Taresians,

29:42.529 --> 29:45.530
I began questioning their story
about Ensign Kim's birth.

29:45.530 --> 29:48.031
I thought you'd confirmed
that he has Taresian DNA.

29:48.131 --> 29:51.731
I did... and he does...
at least, he does now.

29:51.731 --> 29:54.232
But when I checked his
previous microcellular scans,

29:54.332 --> 29:57.932
I found no traces of the
Taresian genetic fragments.

29:58.032 --> 30:00.633
I can only conclude
that he wasn't born with them.

30:00.633 --> 30:03.433
Their whole story about
embryo implantation was a lie.

30:03.533 --> 30:04.834
He's human.

30:04.934 --> 30:07.734
Yes, although
maybe not for long.

30:07.734 --> 30:11.135
The alien DNA is continuing
to alter his genetic structure.

30:11.235 --> 30:13.135
Within a few days,
he'll be indistinguishable

30:13.135 --> 30:14.535
from a native Taresian.

30:14.535 --> 30:16.636
Do you have any idea
how this new DNA

30:16.736 --> 30:18.136
could have gotten
into his cells?

30:18.136 --> 30:19.636
The most likely
transfer mechanism

30:19.736 --> 30:20.837
would be a retrovirus--

30:20.837 --> 30:23.037
he was probably exposed
during an away mission.

30:23.137 --> 30:26.238
Wouldn't the biofilters pick up
the virus and eliminate it?

30:26.338 --> 30:27.538
They may very well have.

30:27.538 --> 30:31.939
But once the virus transferred
the DNA into his cells,

30:31.939 --> 30:33.839
''killing the messenger''
wouldn't have helped.

30:33.839 --> 30:36.740
Is there any way to determine
exactly when he was infected?

30:36.740 --> 30:38.340
Indeed there is.

30:38.340 --> 30:39.340
The transporter buffer

30:39.440 --> 30:41.840
performs its own version
of a microcellular scan

30:41.840 --> 30:43.341
every time someone uses it.

30:43.341 --> 30:45.541
I reviewed the logs
and found the first appearance

30:45.641 --> 30:47.942
of the alien genes
in his molecular pattern

30:48.042 --> 30:50.342
on stardate 50698.

30:50.342 --> 30:53.743
Our away mission to that planet
where we found the vorillium.

30:53.843 --> 30:55.643
Harry was with us
and he was separated

30:55.643 --> 30:56.943
from the group for a while.

30:57.043 --> 30:59.344
He might have been infected
by something he ate or drank,

30:59.344 --> 31:01.044
even something he touched.

31:01.044 --> 31:04.145
So Harry gets infused
with alien DNA,

31:04.145 --> 31:07.045
which gives him the instinctive
urge to come here.

31:07.045 --> 31:09.346
Then the Taresians tell him
this elaborate story

31:09.346 --> 31:12.646
to make him believe
he was one of them. Why?

31:12.746 --> 31:15.047
Don't forget that welcoming
committee on the planet.

31:15.147 --> 31:17.147
It sounds as if they're
giving him every incentive

31:17.147 --> 31:18.847
to want to stay on Taresia.

31:18.847 --> 31:20.748
And by keeping us away,

31:20.748 --> 31:23.648
they're making the decision
for him.

31:24.848 --> 31:26.849
Here you are.

31:26.849 --> 31:30.650
I hope you'll be
comfortable here.

31:30.650 --> 31:33.550
Is there anything else
that I can get for you?

31:33.550 --> 31:36.451
No. I'll be fine.

31:36.551 --> 31:37.851
Thanks.

31:40.351 --> 31:41.452
Good night.

31:43.152 --> 31:45.052
Get into bed.

31:45.152 --> 31:47.653
You're going to tuck me in?

31:47.653 --> 31:49.953
''Tuck you in''?

31:49.953 --> 31:52.354
It's a human custom.

31:52.454 --> 31:56.654
Parents tuck their children
into bed, tell them a story,

31:56.654 --> 31:59.655
or sing a lullaby to them
to help them get to sleep.

31:59.755 --> 32:01.555
That's sweet.

32:12.457 --> 32:13.558
Lie back and relax.

32:17.158 --> 32:19.259
Lekaria san

32:19.359 --> 32:22.059
Do you understand?

32:22.159 --> 32:24.059
Pleasant dreams.

32:24.059 --> 32:25.360
Mm-hmm.

32:30.161 --> 32:31.461
Now close your eyes.

32:41.763 --> 32:44.063
Mmm. That's smells good.

32:44.063 --> 32:45.663
Mm-hmm.

32:45.663 --> 32:48.364
It's the essence
of rikka flowers.

32:48.364 --> 32:50.064
It's very soothing.

32:59.766 --> 33:01.466
Lekaria san

33:11.568 --> 33:13.269
Good night, Harry.

33:28.671 --> 33:30.372
You're Taresian

33:30.372 --> 33:31.372
Welcome home

33:31.372 --> 33:33.472
l think you'll like it
here, Harry

33:36.573 --> 33:38.473
We've been lucky
to have you, Harry.

33:39.674 --> 33:42.674
You really have been special
all your life.

33:42.674 --> 33:45.475
You know where your
real home is, Harry.

33:45.575 --> 33:47.875
I think you'll like it here,
Harry.

33:47.875 --> 33:50.976
Stay with me.

34:41.385 --> 34:42.485
It's all right.
It's all right.

34:42.585 --> 34:43.585
You were dreaming.

34:45.985 --> 34:48.085
What are you doing here?

34:48.085 --> 34:50.387
We just want to help you relax
and enjoy yourself.

34:50.487 --> 34:55.088
Look, I appreciate the offer,
but I'd really rather be alone.

34:55.088 --> 34:56.288
I don't believe that.

34:56.388 --> 34:58.088
I think you've been spending

34:58.088 --> 35:00.489
too many nights alone,
Harry.

35:00.589 --> 35:02.689
You've got to stop
holding yourself back.

35:02.789 --> 35:05.289
I know you have
the same natural desires

35:05.389 --> 35:06.890
as any Taresian.

35:06.990 --> 35:09.790
Now, you're free to act on them.

35:09.790 --> 35:11.691
You can't fight genetics.

35:11.791 --> 35:13.291
I can try.

35:19.292 --> 35:21.192
I want you to choose me, Harry.

35:21.292 --> 35:22.693
Choose both of us,

35:22.793 --> 35:24.993
then you'll only have
to find one more wife.

35:26.293 --> 35:28.994
I'm not joining with you
or with anybody.

35:29.094 --> 35:31.594
But that's the reason why you
were drawn back home, Harry--

35:31.594 --> 35:33.295
to have children.

35:33.295 --> 35:35.095
Listen to your instincts.

35:35.195 --> 35:36.195
No.

35:37.695 --> 35:41.296
Like I told you before,
I'm going back to Voyager

35:41.396 --> 35:44.597
You could never be as valuable
to them as you are to us.

35:44.697 --> 35:45.797
We need you.

35:45.797 --> 35:47.797
You have a responsibility
to your people

35:47.797 --> 35:50.198
to pass on your genes
to the next generation.

35:50.198 --> 35:52.598
If there's anything your
Taresian genes have given you,

35:52.698 --> 35:54.499
it's a sense
of duty and loyalty.

35:54.599 --> 35:58.399
My loyalty is to my crew
and my family back home.

35:58.499 --> 36:00.300
You don't belong
with them anymore.

36:00.300 --> 36:02.700
This is who you are-- one of us.

36:02.800 --> 36:04.300
Your place is here.

36:06.601 --> 36:09.001
We'll make you glad you stayed.

36:09.101 --> 36:12.902
Think of Taymon,
how happy he's been.

36:12.902 --> 36:15.402
Let yourself be happy.

36:15.502 --> 36:17.803
It's the right choice, Harry.

36:17.903 --> 36:20.503
This is the life
you were always meant to have.

36:38.107 --> 36:42.007
Maybe this life
wouldn't be so terrible.

36:43.308 --> 36:44.908
It will be wonderful.

36:44.908 --> 36:47.908
You'll have everything
you ever wanted

36:48.008 --> 36:50.909
and a place of honor
among your people.

36:50.909 --> 36:53.409
You'll never be alone again,
Harry.

36:53.409 --> 36:55.310
We'll make sure of that.

36:56.810 --> 36:58.210
Three wives?

36:58.310 --> 36:59.211
Mm-hmm.

36:59.311 --> 37:00.311
Hmm.

37:04.211 --> 37:06.212
I've got to think
about my choice.

37:06.312 --> 37:08.212
I know you're attracted to me.

37:08.212 --> 37:10.113
There's been a connection
between us

37:10.113 --> 37:11.713
since the moment you got here.

37:11.813 --> 37:12.913
You're right.

37:12.913 --> 37:14.113
I felt it, too.

37:19.414 --> 37:23.315
I'm definitely considering you
as one of my wives.

37:36.217 --> 37:37.818
What are you doing?

37:37.818 --> 37:42.219
Well, it's like you said before,
this could be exciting.

37:49.720 --> 37:51.620
Remember, you both...

37:53.421 --> 37:54.921
want to make me happy,
don't you?

37:55.021 --> 37:57.821
This is some kind of trick.

38:02.722 --> 38:03.823
Sorry about that.

38:03.823 --> 38:05.123
Shh!

38:33.628 --> 38:34.828
Taymon?

38:36.729 --> 38:38.329
It's Harry.

38:38.429 --> 38:40.329
I really need your help.

38:51.731 --> 38:53.232
Are you in there?

39:27.438 --> 39:29.438
So is this what I should expect
on my honeymoon?

39:29.538 --> 39:31.239
It would have been
much easier for you

39:31.339 --> 39:32.439
if you hadn't seen this.

39:32.439 --> 39:35.240
You mean easier for you
to lead me to the slaughter.

39:35.240 --> 39:36.740
What did you do to Taymon?

39:36.740 --> 39:39.040
We must denucleate
a large number of cells

39:39.040 --> 39:41.641
to collect enough genetic
material for conception.

39:48.042 --> 39:50.642
That's why there
are no men here.

39:50.642 --> 39:53.943
They don't leave
with their embryos in stasis...

39:54.043 --> 39:56.143
they're killed.

39:56.243 --> 39:58.044
Any father should be willing
to sacrifice himself

39:58.144 --> 39:59.844
for the sake of his children,

39:59.844 --> 40:01.744
for the continuation
of his race.

40:01.844 --> 40:03.645
Was anything you told me true?

40:03.745 --> 40:07.145
About Taresians being born
on other worIds...

40:07.245 --> 40:09.746
about my being one of you?!

40:09.746 --> 40:12.146
It's true male children
are very rare here

40:12.146 --> 40:15.847
and that we seek out new DNA
to sustain our race.

40:15.947 --> 40:18.748
We need males of other species--
like you--

40:18.748 --> 40:21.348
who can be transformed
into compatible mates.

40:21.448 --> 40:23.749
Transformed?

40:23.749 --> 40:26.349
That's what these genes
are doing to me?

40:26.449 --> 40:28.749
You'll be celebrated
for your contribution.

40:28.749 --> 40:30.450
Don't count on it.

40:32.650 --> 40:35.251
You're going to take me
to a communications terminal

40:35.351 --> 40:36.951
where I can contact my ship.

40:45.453 --> 40:46.453
Stay out of my way.

40:46.453 --> 40:47.753
This won't work.

40:47.853 --> 40:49.553
You're too important to us.

40:49.653 --> 40:52.654
Whatever happens to me,
they won't allow you to leave.

40:58.055 --> 41:00.455
If we hit the grid here,
we'll have a few seconds

41:00.455 --> 41:02.756
before the patrol ship
can move in to intercept us.

41:02.756 --> 41:04.856
That doesn't give you much time
to get a lock on Harry.

41:04.856 --> 41:05.956
Then I'll have to be quick.

41:05.956 --> 41:07.657
Are the shields ready?

41:07.657 --> 41:09.857
The new configuration is stable.

41:09.957 --> 41:12.157
Set a course
for the target coordinates

41:12.157 --> 41:13.758
and engage at full impulse.

41:13.858 --> 41:14.958
Aye, Captain.

41:21.959 --> 41:24.160
We're disrupting the grid,
but we need more speed

41:24.260 --> 41:25.860
to overcome
the inertial resistance.

41:25.860 --> 41:27.660
Increasing power.

41:34.962 --> 41:36.362
We're clear.

41:36.362 --> 41:38.962
I'm not picking up
Harry's com signal.

41:38.962 --> 41:41.263
Initiating level-1
bio-scans of the surface.

41:41.363 --> 41:44.263
Captain, the Taresian ship
is on an intercept course.

41:44.363 --> 41:46.264
Battle stations.

42:12.869 --> 42:16.169
This could have been
a joyous occasion.

42:16.169 --> 42:18.170
Amal ulat

42:19.570 --> 42:20.870
Now!

42:27.571 --> 42:29.372
I won't let you do this to me!

42:29.472 --> 42:32.472
Harry, there's nowhere to go.

42:37.473 --> 42:38.874
We've got him.

42:40.174 --> 42:41.574
Setting a new course.

42:41.574 --> 42:43.474
The Taresians are in pursuit.

42:43.574 --> 42:44.475
Return fire.

42:44.575 --> 42:45.475
Aye, sir.

42:45.575 --> 42:47.575
Captain, we've got
another problem.

42:47.675 --> 42:49.676
Three Nasari ships
coming straight at us.

42:49.676 --> 42:50.676
Time till intercept?

42:50.676 --> 42:52.576
Less than one minute.

42:55.177 --> 42:56.177
Harry.

42:56.177 --> 42:57.177
Captain.

42:58.577 --> 42:59.777
Welcome back.

42:59.777 --> 43:01.878
We could use your strategic
intuition about now.

43:01.978 --> 43:03.178
I'm counting on the Taresians

43:03.278 --> 43:05.579
not to back off
from those Nasari ships.

43:05.579 --> 43:06.179
They won't.

43:06.279 --> 43:07.179
Good.

43:07.279 --> 43:08.579
Let's hope
they're more interested

43:08.579 --> 43:10.179
in fighting
with each other than with us.

43:10.179 --> 43:11.380
Five seconds to intercept.

43:20.381 --> 43:22.682
We are no longer being pursued.

43:22.682 --> 43:25.682
Let's not give them a chance
to change their mind.

43:34.384 --> 43:36.584
But Odysseus had been warned
that these women,

43:36.584 --> 43:39.285
the sirens,
sang a song so beautiful

43:39.285 --> 43:41.685
that any man who heard it
would be lured to his death.

43:41.685 --> 43:43.986
So how did he get the ship
past them?

43:43.986 --> 43:45.586
He told his crew
to cover their ears

43:45.586 --> 43:47.586
so they couldn't hear
the sirens' song.

43:47.586 --> 43:50.387
But he also had them tie him
to the mast of the ship

43:50.487 --> 43:52.087
so he could listen himself

43:52.087 --> 43:55.088
without being led astray
as they sailed past.

43:55.088 --> 43:57.988
Anyone would have been drawn in
by these... Taresians.

43:58.088 --> 44:00.889
I have never seen so many
beautiful women in my life.

44:00.989 --> 44:02.989
It wasn't just the women.

44:03.089 --> 44:04.089
Oh...

44:06.090 --> 44:07.990
There was also
something exciting

44:07.990 --> 44:09.690
about having a new identity...

44:09.790 --> 44:12.291
being more than just
''young Ensign Kim.''

44:12.291 --> 44:15.391
Well, I, for one, am glad
to have a young Ensign Kim

44:15.391 --> 44:17.692
back with us.

44:17.692 --> 44:18.692
Although I still say

44:18.692 --> 44:20.292
you should have kept
some of those spots.

44:20.292 --> 44:22.393
I thought they were
very distinguished.

44:24.893 --> 44:26.894
I don't see what's so bad
about being you.

44:26.894 --> 44:29.594
You're good at your job,
everybody likes you.

44:29.694 --> 44:31.294
Being likable is fine,

44:31.394 --> 44:33.795
but sometimes I wish
I could be more bold,

44:33.795 --> 44:35.695
confident with women--
more like you.

44:35.695 --> 44:38.196
Like me?

44:40.996 --> 44:42.897
You might want
to reconsider that, Harry.

44:42.997 --> 44:44.697
There could be prison time
involved.

44:47.097 --> 44:50.098
Actually, since I've been
on Voyager,

44:50.098 --> 44:51.398
I've tried to be more like you.

44:53.399 --> 44:54.399
That'll be the day.

44:54.499 --> 44:55.399
I'm serious.

44:55.499 --> 44:57.099
You're my role model.

44:57.099 --> 44:58.499
You're reliable, hard-working,

44:58.600 --> 45:00.100
extremely punctual.

45:00.100 --> 45:01.100
Did I mention polite?

45:01.200 --> 45:02.200
Thanks a lot.
