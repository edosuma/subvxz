You all act like children.

Now you're in charge
of children.

of a chili's waitress

- Oh, hello. Okay.
- Oh, hello to you.

- Let's go.
- Tammy! Tammy! Tammy! Tammy!

16:40.700 --> 16:42.467
- I'm not afraid of you, Tammy.
- What?!

16:42.500 --> 16:44.067
You better put your boy
on a leash

16:44.100 --> 16:46.233
or I'll find all your asses
out in the parking lot.

16:46.267 --> 16:47.900

- You better be.

You three,

16:52.900 --> 16:55.733
Quinn will see you now.
You serve
an invaluable function, Tammy.

your ass up in there, boy.

- Loren, get in here.
- Missed.

Geoffrey: Leave Tammy alone.

17:00.833 --> 17:03.367
So, how long is Bryce
suspended for? Two weeks?

17:03.400 --> 17:05.533
And he can't ever
play lacrosse again, right?

17:05.567 --> 17:06.967
Here's an idea.

17:07.000 --> 17:10.800
How about the three of you
start to focus on yourselves...

17:10.833 --> 17:12.967
Oh, come on.
Rather than Bryce chastain?

17:13.000 --> 17:15.067
Don't tell me he got off,
Geoffrey.

17:15.100 --> 17:17.400
Students' actions have
to have consequences, Geoffrey.

17:17.433 --> 17:19.900
You see what's in my hand here?

17:19.933 --> 17:24.633
This is a check for $5,000
from Bryce chastain sr.

to Reed smoot high school.

I did not take a bribe.

17:30.900 --> 17:32.700
- Yes, you did.
- It's a coincidence.

17:32.733 --> 17:34.500
His dad wanted
to make a donation.

You took it in

17:47.667 --> 17:54.400
I do not think that Bryce
chastain is doing heroin.

17:54.433 --> 17:57.500
And if i were to find out
that three teachers

17:57.533 --> 18:04.200
planted heroin in his locker,
i would have to f-word them.

18:04.233 --> 18:06.500
You're gonna f-word us?

18:06.533 --> 18:08.333
Yes.

18:08.367 --> 18:10.667
I guess if somebody's
got to go first, i can go.

Fire...
The word is fire, fairbell.

18:13.600 --> 18:14.867
God, i didn't now.

18:14.900 --> 18:17.233
I think all three of you
have a class to get to,

18:17.267 --> 18:19.833
so... Let's get to it.

18:22.900 --> 18:26.400
Thank you for not
f-wording us, you coward.

go ahead and take a knee.

18:40.833 --> 18:42.800
Let's have some share time.
[ Sighs ]

18:42.833 --> 18:43.900
I'm sorry for the grumps.

18:43.933 --> 18:45.900
I just came from getting
my a-hole chewed on

18:45.933 --> 18:49.033
by the big man 'cause i tried
to stick up for myself

18:49.067 --> 18:53.033
for once and i failed...
As usual.

18:53.067 --> 18:57.567
I guess the Bryce chastains
of the world win every time.

[ Sniffles ]
I'm sorry.

19:00.500 --> 19:01.876
That was a little bit
of an over share.

19:01.900 --> 19:03.833
I do have some of your drug test
results here.

19:03.867 --> 19:05.067
Thank you for being honest.

19:05.100 --> 19:06.909
None of you are on
performance-enhancing drugs,

19:06.933 --> 19:08.067
but, uh, Cindy, you need

19:08.100 --> 19:10.000
to start drinking
some more water, okay?

19:10.033 --> 19:11.967
That sample was pretty thick.

Okay, eyes up here,
lady tariffs.

19:25.433 --> 19:27.200
