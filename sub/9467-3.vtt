00:01.568 --> 00:01.234
.

00:11.044 --> 00:14.080
'...a bit. I'm Jimmy Carr
and welcome to Drunk History,

00:14.080 --> 00:17.317
the show that brings you
genuine stories from history...'

00:17.317 --> 00:20.887
Come on! '...as told
by blind drunk comedians.'

00:20.887 --> 00:22.489
(hiccups)

00:22.489 --> 00:25.291
'So, get ready
to learn about history

00:25.291 --> 00:29.229
from people who can't remember
what happened five minutes ago.'

00:29.229 --> 00:30.597
I'm so bored.

00:30.597 --> 00:33.666
"That's never gonna happen."
"Can you dig it?"

00:33.666 --> 00:36.269
(laughs) "Yes, I can."

00:36.269 --> 00:39.205
He just wanted to shag.

00:39.205 --> 00:42.442
(burps) Erm... (burps) Erm...

00:54.053 --> 00:55.121
'First up we have

00:55.121 --> 00:58.324
the story of how Prince Edward
gave up the throne for love.'

00:58.324 --> 01:01.728
That's quite a sacrifice.
I have trouble sharing needles.'

01:01.728 --> 01:04.631
'Isy Suttie is in the storyteller
chair for this one.'

01:04.631 --> 01:05.865
(pop)

01:05.865 --> 01:10.203
'After seven glasses of prosecco
and two shots of Sambuca.'

01:11.771 --> 01:15.775
This is a story of Edward VIII
who gave up his throne for love.

01:18.044 --> 01:21.247
Spoiler. Spoiler alert.

01:22.248 --> 01:26.453
Prince Edward was a prince.
He was the Prince of Wales.

01:26.453 --> 01:30.423
Life for Edward in 1920s
was like party after party.

01:30.423 --> 01:32.559
He just loved meeting women.

01:32.559 --> 01:36.162
He didn't care they were married,
single, gay, straight,

01:36.162 --> 01:41.000
conscious, unconscious.
He just wanted to shag!

01:41.000 --> 01:43.837
So his dad, King George V,

01:43.837 --> 01:47.040
he really cared about
the reputation of the royal family

01:47.040 --> 01:50.310
and basically didn't agree
with what Edward was doing.

01:50.310 --> 01:52.312
(hiccups)

01:57.350 --> 01:59.052
(soft jazz music)

01:59.052 --> 02:02.455
They were at a ball and the King
was there in all his finery

02:02.455 --> 02:04.624
and he was watching Edward.

02:04.624 --> 02:08.026
Edward was lying
with women all on top of him.

02:08.026 --> 02:12.832
And George was like,
"You are a big problem."

02:12.832 --> 02:16.736
But the worst thing about Edward,
as far as his father was concerned,

02:16.736 --> 02:19.973
was that he loved having sex
with married women.

02:19.973 --> 02:23.676
George didn't like that because it
gave the royal family a bad name.

02:23.676 --> 02:28.715
So King George turns to his trusted
friend, Alan Lascelles.

02:28.715 --> 02:32.252
But everyone calls him Tommy.
He was like, "What am I gonna do?"

02:32.252 --> 02:35.255
"He's my son and he's
a massive embarrassment to me."

02:35.255 --> 02:37.624
"He's doing all this stuff
under my nose."

02:37.624 --> 02:40.827
"I'm not gonna be alive forever.
I don't know what to do."

02:40.827 --> 02:43.029
Tommy Lascelles was like,

02:43.029 --> 02:47.233
"I think that the best thing would be

02:47.233 --> 02:49.435
if someone looked after him."

02:49.435 --> 02:52.972
So King George was like, "I don't
know what good it's gonna do."

02:52.972 --> 02:55.642
"I'm looking at Edward now
and he's fucked."

02:55.642 --> 02:58.945
Lascelles was like,
"Leave it with me."

03:00.847 --> 03:04.117
So Lascelles becomes
Prince Edward's private secretary

03:04.117 --> 03:06.252
and tries to keep an eye on him.

03:06.252 --> 03:10.056
He basically had to follow Edward
around picking up the pieces,

03:10.056 --> 03:15.962
which consisted of bras, knickers,
sex toys, disgruntled husbands.

03:15.962 --> 03:19.766
He used to cuddle them and say,
"It'll be all right."

03:19.766 --> 03:21.868
The problem was, every time Edward

03:21.868 --> 03:25.371
wanted to have sex with someone's
wife, which was very frequent,

03:25.371 --> 03:27.674
he didn't know what to do with
Lascelles.

03:27.674 --> 03:30.076
Lascelles was always there like,
"Hiya!"

03:30.076 --> 03:34.881
So in the end he decided to put
Lascelles on a chair...

03:34.881 --> 03:36.983
...facing the wall.

03:36.983 --> 03:40.687
Like in Blair Witch Project.
Then Edward would be shagging them.

03:40.687 --> 03:44.624
He'd be like, "I'm so cool, I'm
the Prince, one day I'll be king."

03:44.624 --> 03:47.560
Then Lascelles would be looking
at the wall going,

03:47.560 --> 03:50.229
"Oh, well, that's Edward."

03:50.229 --> 03:54.033
But it wasn't actually working.
If you looked at it from the outside,

03:54.033 --> 03:56.436
Edward was shagging
as much as he was.

03:56.436 --> 03:59.906
Then in 1928 the King got really ill.

03:59.906 --> 04:04.444
And Lascelles got this call
and he was like, "Hiya!"

04:04.444 --> 04:07.046
The King was like,
"Hello, I'm not very well."

04:07.046 --> 04:09.616
Lascelles was like,
"Have you got a cold?"

04:09.616 --> 04:13.052
The King was like,
"No, it's a bit worse than a cold."

04:13.052 --> 04:15.455
"I'm kind of on my deathbed,
actually."

04:15.455 --> 04:18.024
"Have you curbed Edward's wild ways?"

04:18.024 --> 04:22.028
Lascelles was like, "...yeah."

04:22.028 --> 04:26.065
"He's, er, he's really reformed."

04:26.065 --> 04:29.602
Then the King was like,
"I need you to come home."

04:29.602 --> 04:32.071
"I want to see Edward.
He's going to be King."

04:32.071 --> 04:36.242
Lascelles was like,
"OK, I'll go and get him."

04:37.243 --> 04:40.113
So Lascelles had to get
that young prince home.

04:40.113 --> 04:45.451
So he said to him, "Dude, you've had
sex with 18 women tonight."

04:45.451 --> 04:48.755
"I've just had a call from
your father. He's not very well."

04:48.755 --> 04:50.890
Ed was like, "Say my name, bitch!"

04:50.890 --> 04:54.227
Then Lascelles was like,
"This is your dying father."

04:54.227 --> 04:58.231
"Do you not care about him?
I am outta here!"

04:58.231 --> 05:03.469
But Edward didn't even hear cos
he was too busy having sex yet again.

05:03.469 --> 05:05.705
Good old sex.

05:05.705 --> 05:07.707
Our friend and enemy.

05:09.242 --> 05:11.711
Luckily, the King didn't die.

05:11.711 --> 05:14.313
It turned out to just be
a really bad cold.

05:14.313 --> 05:17.050
But Lascelles had gone.

05:17.050 --> 05:22.522
So Edward was left on his own
and he was going fucking mental.

05:22.522 --> 05:26.192
He was shagging anything that moved
AND stuff that didn't move.

05:26.192 --> 05:29.028
Statues, traffic cones.

05:29.028 --> 05:31.130
He was like, "Come on!"

05:31.130 --> 05:33.132
(laughs, hiccups)

05:34.000 --> 05:35.201
Fuck's sake.

05:35.201 --> 05:37.603
And then everything changed
for Edward.

05:37.603 --> 05:43.609
He went to party in 1931 and he saw
someone who changed his very being.

05:44.644 --> 05:47.146
"Oh, my God."

05:52.452 --> 05:55.188
"She's amazing."

05:55.188 --> 06:00.226
She had black hair and red lips
and a nose and two eyes and teeth.

06:00.226 --> 06:01.928
She was like everyone else

06:01.928 --> 06:06.432
but he felt more strongly about her
than he ever had about anyone.

06:06.432 --> 06:08.434
She was the one.

06:09.435 --> 06:13.239
He walked over, it was like five
steps but felt like a million steps.

06:13.239 --> 06:15.041
He got to her and he was like,

06:15.041 --> 06:17.710
"H-h-hello, hello, hello,
my name's Edward."

06:17.710 --> 06:21.147
She was like,
"Hi, my name's Wallis Simpson."

06:21.147 --> 06:25.785
"But I can't talk to you because
you're a man and I'm married."

06:25.785 --> 06:29.889
She was like... (huffs)
"I'm so bored."

06:29.889 --> 06:33.526
He's like...
(laughs awkwardly) "Yeah, me too."

06:34.427 --> 06:36.763
Inside he was like,
"What are you doing?"

06:36.763 --> 06:40.633
"Normally you've got them in bed by
now. What is the matter with you?"

06:40.633 --> 06:44.437
Then he was like,
"Ah-ha-ha! I've just remembered."

06:44.437 --> 06:47.607
"I'm the future King.
I can use this."

06:47.607 --> 06:52.311
He said, "Oh, by the way, I'm going
to be the future King of England."

06:52.311 --> 06:56.282
She was like... (gasps) "The future
King of England, are you sure?"

06:56.282 --> 06:59.919
He was like, "I'm sure. It's just
something that happens to me."

06:59.919 --> 07:04.023
"Are you sure you're sure?"
"Yeah, I'm fucking sure I'm sure."

07:04.023 --> 07:08.427
Her husband, Ernest Simpson,
was like, "Oh, fuck."

07:11.430 --> 07:12.632
And then...

07:12.632 --> 07:15.768
(burps) Erm... (burps) Erm...

07:15.768 --> 07:19.172
Basically, Edward was like,
"I don't want anyone else now."

07:19.172 --> 07:21.073
"I just want Mrs Wallis Simpson."

07:21.073 --> 07:24.644
And for five years
Edward carries on with Wallis.

07:24.644 --> 07:29.248
But she was married
and that was not good.

07:29.248 --> 07:33.119
And then on 20th January 1936,

07:33.119 --> 07:36.255
George passed away!

07:36.255 --> 07:37.623
Died, dead.

07:37.623 --> 07:40.426
Edward was finally free
and he thought,

07:40.426 --> 07:45.031
"All these years I've been trying
to do what my dad wanted me to do."

07:45.031 --> 07:47.867
"He said I couldn't have sex
with traffic cones."

07:47.867 --> 07:50.036
"It doesn't matter now. He's dead."

07:50.036 --> 07:51.704
Finally, he was King.

07:51.704 --> 07:54.640
But he just wasn't that bothered
about being King.

07:54.640 --> 07:58.244
Mrs Wallis Simpson was there
all the time and she was like,

07:58.244 --> 08:02.448
"Come back to bed.
I've made freshly baked croissants."

08:02.448 --> 08:06.252
And he was like, "I've got to think
of a law to do with the people."

08:06.252 --> 08:07.954
"I can't come back to bed now."

08:07.954 --> 08:10.456
"I really love freshly baked
croissants."

08:10.456 --> 08:13.626
"I don't know what to do!"

08:13.626 --> 08:16.495
He was just shagging.

08:16.495 --> 08:20.967
In November 1936, Edward was like,

08:20.967 --> 08:23.836
"I want to marry this lady.
She's the best."

08:23.836 --> 08:27.106
So he goes to the Prime Minister,
who is Mr Stanley Baldwin.

08:27.106 --> 08:30.443
He's like, "I'm going to marry
Mrs Wallis Simpson."

08:30.443 --> 08:33.246
Mr Stanley Baldwin was like,
"No, you're not."

08:33.246 --> 08:34.714
He was like, "Yes, I am."

08:34.714 --> 08:37.717
And Mr Stanley Baldwin was like,
"No, you're not."

08:37.717 --> 08:41.087
And he's like, "Yes, I am."
He's like, "No, you're not."

08:41.087 --> 08:44.924
And in the end,
there was an ulti-fucking-matum.

08:44.924 --> 08:48.527
Mr Stanley Baldwin was like,
"You have three choices."

08:48.527 --> 08:52.565
"One, is that you give up the throne

08:52.565 --> 08:54.634
and you're allowed to marry her."

08:54.634 --> 09:00.406
"Two, you are allowed to marry her
but the government will resign."

09:00.406 --> 09:03.643
"So you'll be left with
no government."

09:03.643 --> 09:08.347
"Three, you don't marry her.
You can remain king."

09:08.347 --> 09:11.651
"We can bring you all
the traffic cones in the world."

09:11.651 --> 09:16.255
Edward was like... (groans)
"Why are you doing this to me, man?"

09:16.255 --> 09:21.027
He was like, "I love Mrs Wallis
Simpson. I've got to marry her."

09:21.027 --> 09:24.430
And so Edward decided to abdicate.

09:24.430 --> 09:26.832
The day came for the King to resign.

09:26.832 --> 09:30.836
And he said, "I can't carry on."

09:30.836 --> 09:32.905
"I love a woman."

09:32.905 --> 09:37.476
"This woman has stopped me from
being the King that I love

09:37.476 --> 09:40.680
and I found it
a burden of responsibility."

09:40.680 --> 09:44.650
"The burden of responsibility
has eked into my bones

09:44.650 --> 09:47.053
and I cannot carry on."

09:47.053 --> 09:48.054
"Amen."

09:50.056 --> 09:52.325
"Yeah, cool."

09:52.325 --> 09:54.193
So Edward had given up the throne

09:54.193 --> 09:57.430
after just 11 months
in charge of the country.

09:57.430 --> 09:58.631
It was a travesty.

09:58.631 --> 10:00.533
But it is a quite nice love story.

10:00.533 --> 10:05.604
It starts sleazy but,
at the end of the day,

10:05.604 --> 10:09.008
he does fall in love with her
and she does fall in love with him

10:09.008 --> 10:12.712
and they do fight for their love
like Cheryl Cole Fernandez-Versini

10:12.712 --> 10:14.814
and I'm happy for them.

10:14.814 --> 10:17.883
To Edward and Mrs Simpson,
may you live long and reign.

10:17.883 --> 10:20.052
Although you're dead, but...

10:20.052 --> 10:22.121
I hope your ghosts are watching this

10:22.121 --> 10:25.224
and you appreciate
what I've done for you.

10:25.224 --> 10:28.828
'I immediately went home and
abdicated after meeting my missus.'

10:28.828 --> 10:31.864
'In fact, I was up all night
abdicating into a sock.'

10:31.864 --> 10:36.135
'Time for a break. Back in a sec
with the Great Escape.'

10:36.135 --> 10:38.104
"What are you talking about?"

10:38.104 --> 10:41.040
'I think that's Steve McQueen
turning in his grave.'

10:41.040 --> 10:42.608
That is the end of the game!

10:44.010 --> 10:44.210
.

10:46.712 --> 10:46.912
.

10:48.314 --> 10:51.283
'Welcome back to Drunk History.
This is the show for you

10:51.283 --> 10:53.986
if you're a fan of Time Team
but are disappointed

10:53.986 --> 10:58.924
at how little time the team spends
pissing against war memorials.'

10:58.924 --> 11:01.594
'It's time for World War Two's
great escape,

11:01.594 --> 11:04.930
the story of 200 men
all crammed into the same tunnel.'

11:04.930 --> 11:07.533
'If you want to know more,
ask your mum.'

11:07.533 --> 11:10.002
'Ed Gamble's in the hot seat
for this one

11:10.002 --> 11:13.873
after 11 double gin and tonics
and seven double vodka Red Bulls.'

11:13.873 --> 11:17.343
'You'll notice he seems incredibly
composed for the first bit

11:17.343 --> 11:21.747
but keep watching, it's an absolute
joy when he finally crumbles.'

11:21.747 --> 11:25.184
This is the story of
the Great Escape.

11:25.184 --> 11:29.522
It is apparently the greatest
escape that has ever happened.

11:29.522 --> 11:31.724
Erm, hopefully you'll agree.

11:33.125 --> 11:36.328
The main guy we need to talk about
is called Roger.

11:36.328 --> 11:39.532
He was a South African gentlemen

11:39.532 --> 11:44.970
and in 1942 was taken
to Stalag Luft III,

11:44.970 --> 11:48.007
which was a concentration camp.
The third of its name.

11:48.007 --> 11:51.043
Roger Bushell was Big Daddy Escape.

11:51.043 --> 11:54.113
(South African accent)
"All right, everyone."

11:54.113 --> 11:57.917
"Here comes Roger Bushell.
Try keeping me in this place, even."

11:57.917 --> 12:01.921
"I escape from everything,
if you don't mind."

12:01.921 --> 12:03.722
That's what he said.

12:03.722 --> 12:07.593
I'd imagine they're cuffing him the
whole time and he'd just be like,

12:07.593 --> 12:11.330
"Tada! Put me in cuffs if you like,
but I'll fucking escape."

12:13.866 --> 12:17.503
So he'd already been warned
that it was his last chance.

12:17.503 --> 12:22.708
(German accent) "OK, you have tried
to escape on two occasions before."

12:22.708 --> 12:26.112
"But that's OK. This time, though,

12:26.112 --> 12:30.916
if you try to escape we are
going to be very angry Nazis."

12:30.916 --> 12:33.953
But Roger, he doesn't give a fuck.

12:33.953 --> 12:39.191
"OK, I won't try and escape this
time. I'll just make this my home."

12:39.191 --> 12:41.293
He doesn't care, does he?

12:41.293 --> 12:42.495
So Roger's in.

12:45.197 --> 12:49.268
When Roger arrives, the escape
committee in the camp was a mess.

12:50.736 --> 12:53.405
They'd all lost focus,
they'd all lost heart.

12:53.405 --> 12:54.874
So they need a leader.

12:54.874 --> 12:58.010
He's like, "Right,
I'm going to rally these guys."

12:58.010 --> 13:00.012
"Gather round. I'm Roger Bushell.

13:00.012 --> 13:02.948
"We're going to escape
from this fucking place."

13:02.948 --> 13:06.785
"Bit rude. Why would he throw
a 'fucking' into that?"

13:06.785 --> 13:08.320
"I've come up with a plan."

13:08.320 --> 13:13.726
"We are going to get 200 people out
to escape."

13:13.726 --> 13:17.463
People were like,
"What are you talking about, mate?"

13:17.463 --> 13:19.999
But Roger was like,
"Don't laugh at me, man."

13:19.999 --> 13:22.067
"People laughed at Jesus."

13:22.067 --> 13:25.771
Someone at the back went,
"Tell us about your new ideas."

13:25.771 --> 13:28.474
"OK, three tunnels."

13:28.474 --> 13:30.809
He'd come up with three tunnels.

13:30.809 --> 13:32.044
"Escape cubed."

13:32.044 --> 13:35.948
Everyone went, "Ooh."
There was a little bobble of noise.

13:35.948 --> 13:39.518
Little bobble of noise.
"Ooh," like that.

13:39.518 --> 13:43.722
They went, "Tell us more."
"OK, I'll tell you more."

13:43.722 --> 13:47.726
"I've got three tunnels.
One of them's called Tom."

13:47.726 --> 13:51.530
"One of them's called Dick,
and one of them's called Harry."

13:51.530 --> 13:53.566
Which is like normal English names.

13:53.566 --> 13:55.534
So you can say whatever you want.

13:55.534 --> 13:57.436
"What were you doing last night?"

13:57.436 --> 13:59.838
"I was really deep inside Tom
last night."

13:59.838 --> 14:02.041
"I was chipping away at
Harry's dirt."

14:02.041 --> 14:05.811
The guards would be like,
"I don't want to hear about that."

14:10.316 --> 14:12.318
So old Roger,

14:12.318 --> 14:17.323
he's all up for sorting out
his Ocean's Eleven-style team.

14:18.123 --> 14:21.327
He's thought, "I'm gonna need
someone good at tunnels."

14:21.327 --> 14:26.131
Someone popped up.
A lad from Canada call Wally Floody.

14:26.131 --> 14:29.001
When I first heard this name,
my first reaction was

14:29.001 --> 14:32.271
this is the world's person to be
in charge of tunnels ever.

14:32.271 --> 14:33.906
Wally is a type of idiot

14:33.906 --> 14:37.509
and Floody is the worst thing
that can happen in a tunnel.

14:37.509 --> 14:43.215
That is the same as Plonker Collapse.
But he claims he's good with a spade.

14:43.215 --> 14:48.921
Roger Bushell was like, "OK,
despite your name, I will trust you."

14:48.921 --> 14:50.723
"Can you dig it?"

14:50.723 --> 14:51.724
And... (laughs)

14:55.327 --> 14:57.396
And he says, "Yes, I can."

14:57.396 --> 14:59.398
(laughs)

15:01.367 --> 15:03.035
So what they need to sort out

15:03.035 --> 15:07.039
is when they're on the other side of
the tunnel what's gonna happen?

15:07.039 --> 15:10.943
They need civilian clothes.
They're gonna need the documents.

15:10.943 --> 15:12.811
How are they gonna get those?

15:12.811 --> 15:17.082
Apparently, there were a lot of
anti-Nazi guards in there.

15:17.082 --> 15:20.519
So you're looking for the lad
with the skull cap on.

15:20.519 --> 15:22.321
He's reading Gay Times.

15:22.321 --> 15:25.724
You say,
"Look, clearly you are not a Nazi."

15:25.724 --> 15:27.726
"But not that loud."

15:27.726 --> 15:32.931
"Come on, help me
and 199 other lads escape."

15:33.932 --> 15:39.104
And they're like, "OK, I will not
listen to what Hitler says

15:39.104 --> 15:43.709
as long as you give me some
cigarettes and some chocolate."

15:45.511 --> 15:47.913
So they've got all they want.

15:47.913 --> 15:50.616
And they're giving out uniforms.

15:50.616 --> 15:53.519
They're giving out documents.

15:53.519 --> 15:56.522
Your old lads from
the escape committee,

15:56.522 --> 15:59.725
they've got everything they need
to get out.

15:59.725 --> 16:04.630
And there were people digging
all of the time.

16:04.630 --> 16:08.634
Dig, dig... dig, dig, dig, dig, dig.

16:08.634 --> 16:10.536
The old Nazi lads,

16:10.536 --> 16:13.906
every one of them's got
six or seven fags in their mouth.

16:13.906 --> 16:16.241
All their lips are covered
in chocolate.

16:16.241 --> 16:19.645
The main boss, Colonel Freddie,
he's looking around going,

16:19.645 --> 16:21.714
"Something's going on here."

16:21.714 --> 16:26.085
"I think someone might be... might...
might be trying to escape."

16:26.085 --> 16:28.487
(laughs) In his porn voice.

16:28.487 --> 16:31.123
Eventually, they discovered a tunnel.

16:31.123 --> 16:34.526
It was Tom, Dick and Harry.
Erm, they found Tom.

16:34.526 --> 16:36.528
They're all smug, the Germans.

16:36.528 --> 16:40.199
Colonel Freddie was like,
"You look like idiots now."

16:40.199 --> 16:43.268
"You're in our prison
and we have found your tunnel."

16:43.268 --> 16:46.472
But they had two more tunnels.
So they had a back-up.

16:46.472 --> 16:51.710
They'd be like, "Oh... Oh, shit.
you f- Oh, you found my tunnel."

16:51.710 --> 16:54.913
"Y- Oh, God.
Ooh, you've got me, you prick."

16:56.315 --> 16:59.985
They were like, "They're onto us.
We need to get out soon."

17:01.920 --> 17:06.925
Bushell's there and he says,
"OK, guys. Tom has been discovered."

17:06.925 --> 17:10.529
"Next we have the choice between
Harry and Dick."

17:10.529 --> 17:14.031
It's a choice between Harry and Dick.
It's Harry all the time.

17:18.704 --> 17:22.708
So after months and months
and months of digging,

17:22.708 --> 17:25.511
Tunnel Harry is complete.

17:25.511 --> 17:28.513
It's 24th of Motch. (laughs)

17:28.513 --> 17:30.516
(laughter)

17:33.118 --> 17:36.922
It's 20...
(man) It's 24th March, 1944.

17:36.922 --> 17:38.924
And the escape is on.

17:41.727 --> 17:44.129
(laughs)

17:44.129 --> 17:46.064
Ed, Ed, Ed.

17:46.064 --> 17:49.034
(laughs) Oh, fuck.

17:50.536 --> 17:53.272
I mean, literally all
don't sit there silent.

17:53.272 --> 17:55.307
Right.
This is - No, no, no.

17:55.307 --> 17:58.210
Fuck off, Tom.
Like, this is what makes me angry.

17:58.210 --> 18:03.415
You all sit there quiet, watching,
like, "Oh, what's happened to Ed?"

18:03.415 --> 18:05.884
You all met me in a bar earlier.

18:07.920 --> 18:11.123
Oh, we'll all be quiet.
This is like A Serbian Film.

18:11.123 --> 18:13.125
(laughter)

18:14.960 --> 18:18.330
It's 24th March, 1944.

18:19.932 --> 18:23.936
There's 200 men all built up
in Tunnel Harry.

18:25.103 --> 18:28.507
They get to the end of
the Tunnel Harry.

18:28.507 --> 18:31.477
And the tunnel is frozen.

18:32.344 --> 18:36.515
We're bashing against the end
and it's all frozen up.

18:36.515 --> 18:39.785
We're all breathing against
the tunnel.

18:39.785 --> 18:43.121
We're all going... (pants)

18:43.121 --> 18:48.727
And that's the only hot... the only
hot way to get out of the tunnel.

18:48.727 --> 18:50.529
Doing all hot breath.

18:50.529 --> 18:54.533
And then one of us does
a really great brig...

18:54.533 --> 18:56.535
...great big hot breath.

18:58.504 --> 19:01.206
And then the whole door comes away.

19:01.206 --> 19:05.277
But, oh, you think they've won.
But they've not.

19:05.277 --> 19:07.913
Because they're ten feet
short of the woods.

19:07.913 --> 19:10.115
Which is the worst. (burps)

19:10.115 --> 19:13.352
Suddenly there is a gunshot.
(gunshot)

19:13.352 --> 19:16.655
And someone had shot
a shot of bullets.

19:16.655 --> 19:18.991
They realise the game is up.

19:18.991 --> 19:21.727
They've been discovered by the Nazis.

19:21.727 --> 19:23.829
They gotta go! They gotta run!

19:23.829 --> 19:27.733
They fucking gotta cane it.
And then we run.

19:27.733 --> 19:31.870
And then we r-
"Oh, God, it feels amazing."

19:33.005 --> 19:35.007
That is the end of the game!

19:38.510 --> 19:43.649
In total, 76 men had escaped.

19:43.649 --> 19:45.117
Out of 200.

19:45.117 --> 19:48.554
Out of 2- OK, altogether.

19:48.554 --> 19:50.522
Out of ten!

19:50.522 --> 19:52.524
(laughter)

19:56.194 --> 19:59.531
So, Ed.
This is all I need from at the end.

19:59.531 --> 20:01.533
Ed, was it a great escape?

20:04.536 --> 20:05.604
Yes.

20:05.604 --> 20:07.673
(laughter)

20:07.673 --> 20:11.310
Cos only three of them died.

20:11.310 --> 20:13.111
No, only three of them made it.

20:13.111 --> 20:16.081
Fuck you, only three of them died.

20:16.081 --> 20:19.918
In actual fact, in realistic fact,

20:19.918 --> 20:24.489
only thwee m... three men escaped.

20:24.489 --> 20:29.294
The rest were either captured
or kilmed.

20:29.294 --> 20:33.532
I have to say, you have to call it
the pretty average escape,

20:33.532 --> 20:38.470
not the great escapes
or the... moderate escapes.

20:39.304 --> 20:41.206
Fuck you, Nazis.

20:41.206 --> 20:43.508
Who said that?

20:43.508 --> 20:44.910
Hitler.

20:44.910 --> 20:46.912
(laughter)

20:47.913 --> 20:51.049
'What a brilliant story.
They should make a film about it

20:51.049 --> 20:53.552
and put it on telly
every fucking Christmas.'

20:53.552 --> 20:56.254
'That's your lot for
this week's Drunk History.'

20:56.254 --> 20:59.524
'Our comedians have to rush off now
and leave 17 voicemails

20:59.524 --> 21:02.728
on an ex-girlfriend's
answer machine. Good night.'

22:00.952 --> 22:01.153
.
