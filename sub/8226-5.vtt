00:02.602 --> 00:04.103
<i>You are about to see</i>

00:04.105 --> 00:04.970
<i>At home.</i>

00:04.971 --> 00:08.841
You heard him.
Don't do it.

00:09.909 --> 00:11.377
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

00:11.379 --> 00:13.746
<i>Welcome to</i>
<i>"Battle of the Sexes 2",</i>

00:13.748 --> 00:16.815
<i>Where Mythbusters pit</i>
<i>men against women...</i>

00:17.485 --> 00:19.051
<i>...To determine myth from fact.</i>

00:19.053 --> 00:21.387
<i>You'll probably disagree</i>
<i>with our results.</i>

00:21.389 --> 00:25.357
<i>So let's get ready to grumble.</i>

00:26.360 --> 00:30.129
Yep. On this controversial
episode of "Mythbusters"...

00:30.131 --> 00:32.765
I think we might be kicking
some male butt.

00:33.634 --> 00:36.101
...There's
a contentious collection

00:36.103 --> 00:37.569
Of classic clichÃ©s.

00:37.571 --> 00:39.204
You throw
like a girl!

00:39.206 --> 00:43.308
First up,
are guys really the fling kings?

00:43.410 --> 00:44.176
Slow down there, cowboy.

00:44.178 --> 00:46.578
Then, when lost...

00:46.580 --> 00:49.148
...Will a man ever ask for help?

00:49.150 --> 00:51.984
This is fantastic.

00:51.986 --> 00:56.588
Next, are women really
the multitasking masters?

00:56.590 --> 00:57.589
Yeah!

00:57.591 --> 01:00.993
And finally,
in a parallel park-off,

01:00.995 --> 01:03.162
It's...Parkageddon!

01:03.164 --> 01:05.464
Do you have
a license?

01:07.434 --> 01:09.635
Who are the Mythbusters?

01:10.437 --> 01:11.537
Adam Savage...

01:11.539 --> 01:12.604
Now I'm ready.

01:12.606 --> 01:14.540
...And Jamie Hyneman.

01:14.542 --> 01:15.641
This is gonna kill you.

01:15.643 --> 01:20.546
Between them, more than 30 years
of special-effects experience.

01:20.548 --> 01:24.049
Together with Tory Belleci...

01:24.051 --> 01:25.184
That was insane.

01:25.186 --> 01:26.919
...Grant Imahara...

01:26.921 --> 01:28.087
Who wants some?!

01:28.089 --> 01:29.455
...And Kari Byron.

01:29.457 --> 01:30.756
The right tool
for the job.

01:30.758 --> 01:33.892
They don't just tell
the myths.

01:34.260 --> 01:36.328
They put them to the test.

01:42.336 --> 01:47.039
Duck, cover, and get ready
to sleep on the sofa,

01:47.041 --> 01:49.241
Because war will be waged.

01:52.246 --> 01:54.246
The last time the team battled

01:54.248 --> 01:55.614
For supremacy of the sexes...

01:55.616 --> 01:57.850
go ladies! Go ladies!

01:57.852 --> 02:01.320
...They debunked
five fractious fables --

02:01.322 --> 02:02.788
Driving, grilling,

02:02.790 --> 02:03.655
Packing the car,

02:03.657 --> 02:06.558
Navigating, and emotional cues.

02:06.560 --> 02:08.594
Is "flirty" an emotion?

02:08.596 --> 02:10.795
Is "blushing" an emotion?

02:10.798 --> 02:14.032
And with two wins apiece
and one myth tied,

02:14.034 --> 02:17.769
The Mythbusters are once again
declaring a war on error.

02:17.771 --> 02:20.105
I can tell from the way
they're driving

02:20.107 --> 02:21.073
That it's probably a woman.

02:21.075 --> 02:26.044
First up --
a pitched battle of the sexes.

02:27.680 --> 02:29.281
Hmm. Well, you probably
heard it.

02:29.283 --> 02:31.450
I definitely heard it
when I was a kid.

02:31.452 --> 02:33.752
It is the classic
schoolyard taunt,

02:33.754 --> 02:35.420
"You throw like a girl!"

02:35.422 --> 02:36.121
I never heard it.

02:36.123 --> 02:38.323
Well, that's 'cause
you never took gym.

02:38.325 --> 02:39.625
I took art class.

02:39.627 --> 02:40.392
Smart.

02:40.394 --> 02:41.560
At any rate,
it's an insult

02:41.562 --> 02:43.295
And a terrible thing
to say to someone,

02:43.297 --> 02:45.097
But it does raise
a genuine question,

02:45.099 --> 02:47.166
And one we think
is worth answering

02:47.168 --> 02:47.866
Here on "Mythbusters."

02:47.868 --> 02:49.434
And this is
the question --

02:49.436 --> 02:51.270
Is there
a measurable difference

02:51.272 --> 02:53.572
Between the way
a man throws a ball

02:53.574 --> 02:55.140
And a woman throws a ball?

02:55.142 --> 02:57.309
Exactly.

02:58.111 --> 02:59.344
I got it!

02:59.346 --> 03:02.314
It's an age-old
playground put down.

03:02.316 --> 03:04.750
When it comes to
playing with balls --

03:04.752 --> 03:06.685
Specifically,
tossing them around --

03:06.687 --> 03:11.590
Girls are purportedly
the paragons of poor pitching.

03:11.592 --> 03:12.391
To find out,

03:12.393 --> 03:16.595
Adam and Jamie are instigating
an intraspecies throw down.

03:16.597 --> 03:18.630
We're about to do something
on this episode

03:18.632 --> 03:20.899
That's a little bit different
than the path

03:20.901 --> 03:21.833
We would
normally take.

03:21.835 --> 03:23.902
Normally, we'd just get
10 men, 10 women,

03:23.904 --> 03:25.737
Take them out
on a baseball diamond,

03:25.739 --> 03:28.040
And start them throwing --
see what happens.

03:28.042 --> 03:30.242
But we've done a ton of research
into this story,

03:30.244 --> 03:32.978
And if it's true that men
and women throw differently,

03:32.980 --> 03:35.013
There are a million
different theories

03:35.015 --> 03:36.882
And questions around the "why."

03:36.884 --> 03:38.951
Is it cultural?
Is it innate?

03:38.953 --> 03:39.518
Is it genetic?

03:39.520 --> 03:41.653
Does it show up
at a certain age?

03:41.655 --> 03:43.322
Let the throwing begin.

03:45.559 --> 03:46.225
Sorry.

03:46.227 --> 03:48.327
It's a multi-faceted question.

03:48.329 --> 03:52.030
What is a good throw?
How do you measure it?

03:52.032 --> 03:53.932
And who does it better?

03:53.934 --> 03:55.801
To zone in on the science,

03:55.803 --> 03:57.436
Adam and Jamie have hit the gym

03:57.438 --> 04:01.073
And set up
a state-of-the-smart lob lab.

04:01.075 --> 04:03.742
So, how do you
qualitatively measure

04:03.744 --> 04:04.743
Someone's throwing ability?

04:04.745 --> 04:06.712
In the jungle,
when you want to kill something

04:06.714 --> 04:07.446
In order to eat it,

04:07.448 --> 04:09.114
You've got to
be both fast and accurate.

04:09.116 --> 04:11.283
So speed and accuracy
are our two metrics.

04:11.285 --> 04:14.653
But when we've researched
other tests similar to this,

04:14.655 --> 04:16.654
It's been said
that when you stress accuracy,

04:16.656 --> 04:20.158
People slow down their pitch
in order to hit the target.

04:20.160 --> 04:20.826
We don't want that.

04:20.827 --> 04:23.395
We want them
throwing as hard as they can.

04:23.397 --> 04:24.429
So what we're telling them is,

04:24.431 --> 04:27.366
"Throw as hard as you can
at the yellow box."

04:27.368 --> 04:31.536
With accuracy best described
as a lottery in motion...

04:31.538 --> 04:34.239
I don't feel like you and I
are very good at throwing.

04:34.241 --> 04:35.007
No, we're not.

04:35.009 --> 04:38.076
...And a less-than-impressive
slow ball,

04:38.078 --> 04:39.745
Adam and Jamie clearly need help

04:39.747 --> 04:41.947
Understanding
the art of throwing.

04:41.949 --> 04:45.584
Cue major-league pitcher
greg reynolds.

04:45.586 --> 04:48.487
If we're gonna spend
the rest of this episode

04:48.489 --> 04:50.289
Assessing
people's ability to throw,

04:50.291 --> 04:52.891
We need a top-level control
to compare them against.

04:52.893 --> 04:54.760
That's where the guy
behind me comes in,

04:54.762 --> 04:57.529
And he's gonna show us
how it's really done.

04:59.399 --> 05:00.399
Yeah, like that.

05:00.401 --> 05:03.568
With his
90-mile-an-hour fast ball,

05:03.570 --> 05:06.305
Greg nails the center
of the target every time.

05:06.307 --> 05:09.241
And when it's slowed down
and analyzed,

05:09.243 --> 05:11.777
It's clear
that the perfect pitch

05:11.779 --> 05:15.213
Is a complicated
biophysical ballet.

05:15.215 --> 05:15.847
It's all about timing

05:15.849 --> 05:17.449
When you're talking
about pitching,

05:17.451 --> 05:18.083
And so, from your feet

05:18.085 --> 05:19.885
All the way to the end
of your fingertips,

05:19.887 --> 05:21.753
You want to start
that chain reaction

05:21.755 --> 05:22.754
And keep them all
on time.

05:22.756 --> 05:25.357
Wow.
It's kind of like a dance.

05:25.359 --> 05:25.791
Yeah.

05:25.793 --> 05:29.094
So, this is
the perfect pitching technique,

05:29.096 --> 05:31.663
And it requires
years of practice

05:31.665 --> 05:33.398
And an elite physical ability

05:33.400 --> 05:38.537
To combine 90-miles-per-hour
speed and pinpoint accuracy.

05:38.539 --> 05:41.106
But do men
naturally do it better?

05:41.108 --> 05:44.242
To find out,
it's time to get it on.

05:44.244 --> 05:46.445
And so, now we pit
the men against the women,

05:46.447 --> 05:48.447
But not in the way
we normally would

05:48.449 --> 05:49.514
Where we just gather a bunch

05:49.516 --> 05:51.049
Of random 20-something
volunteers

05:51.051 --> 05:51.783
Out of the local paper.

05:51.785 --> 05:55.954
This time, we are pitting groups
of people from different ages

05:55.956 --> 05:56.988
Against each other.

05:56.990 --> 05:58.190
This way, we can compare and see

05:58.192 --> 06:01.660
If there's a difference
not only between men and women,

06:01.662 --> 06:04.429
But whether that exists
across every age

06:04.431 --> 06:05.297
Or whether it happens

06:05.299 --> 06:06.665
At certain stages
developmentally.

06:06.667 --> 06:10.402
So, Adam and Jamie
have selected four pairs

06:10.404 --> 06:13.238
Of average joes
and josephines...

06:13.240 --> 06:13.705
Hi, zoe.

06:13.707 --> 06:16.074
...To go head-to-head
in a pitch battle.

06:16.076 --> 06:19.644
We'll be gauging the throwing
ability of our test subjects

06:19.646 --> 06:21.980
According to
two primary metrics.

06:21.982 --> 06:22.647
Mine will be speed.

06:22.649 --> 06:25.917
I'll be behind the net here
with my Savage radar gun,

06:25.919 --> 06:27.886
Logging how fast they throw.

06:28.622 --> 06:29.821
And I'll be back here

06:29.823 --> 06:32.257
Judging the accuracy
of the throw

06:32.259 --> 06:33.925
On a scale of 1 to 5.

06:34.328 --> 06:37.362
Now, we won't be judging anyone
on a single throw.

06:37.364 --> 06:39.231
All we want you to do
is take that ball

06:39.233 --> 06:41.333
And throw it
right at the yellow square

06:41.335 --> 06:42.734
As hard as you can.

06:42.736 --> 06:43.235
Okay.

06:43.237 --> 06:44.603
No. We're actually
gonna let them warm up,

06:44.605 --> 06:47.372
And then we're going to
be averaging their accuracy

06:47.374 --> 06:48.707
And choosing their best speed

06:48.709 --> 06:50.675
From the multiple throws
that they'll do.

06:50.677 --> 06:54.579
With our first
pint-sized pitcher warmed up

06:54.581 --> 06:55.514
And raring to go...

06:55.516 --> 06:57.816
Okay, hold on there.
Slow down there, cowboy.

06:57.818 --> 06:59.951
...Jamie begins
officially scoring

06:59.953 --> 07:03.288
And averaging zoe's accuracy
across five throws.

07:03.290 --> 07:07.359
A bulls eye scores 5,
the inner square, 4,

07:07.361 --> 07:10.729
All the way down to zero
for a complete miss,

07:10.731 --> 07:13.165
Which zoe is not doing.

07:13.167 --> 07:13.665
Excellent.

07:13.667 --> 07:17.969
Meanwhile, Adam monitors
for zoe's single fastest throw.

07:17.971 --> 07:19.571
she's good.

07:19.573 --> 07:23.375
With the girls' first
impressive score on the board,

07:23.377 --> 07:25.143
Thomas steps up, winds up,

07:25.145 --> 07:28.046
And gives it his best shot
for team men.

07:28.048 --> 07:30.148
Excellent.
That's the spirit.

07:30.150 --> 07:32.584
But when he's done
and the numbers are in,

07:32.586 --> 07:34.519
Adam, for one, is surprised.

07:34.521 --> 07:36.822
I love this kind
of counterintuitive result.

07:36.824 --> 07:38.223
We're testing "Throws like a girl",

07:38.225 --> 07:40.225
And it's supposed to
be some kind of insult --

07:40.227 --> 07:41.893
That girls can't throw
as good as boys.

07:41.895 --> 07:43.728
But our very first
test subjects,

07:43.730 --> 07:46.498
While the boy threw
a little bit faster

07:46.500 --> 07:47.065
Than our girl,

07:47.067 --> 07:49.601
She smoked him
in terms of accuracy.

07:49.603 --> 07:50.368
He was all over the map.

07:50.370 --> 07:52.337
She was going
right for the center.

07:52.339 --> 07:52.904
It was great.

07:52.906 --> 07:55.207
Up next are the 12-year-olds,

07:55.209 --> 07:57.843
And kara continues
the impressive start

07:57.845 --> 07:58.977
By the lady lobbers.

07:58.979 --> 08:02.714
Her top speed
of 31 miles per hour...

08:03.182 --> 08:05.016
She throws a heater.

08:05.018 --> 08:08.353
...And an accuracy average
of 3.75

08:08.355 --> 08:10.489
Lays down a mean marker.

08:10.491 --> 08:11.122
Nice.

08:11.124 --> 08:12.224
But when aaron steps up

08:12.226 --> 08:15.994
And flings
a few fearsome fast balls...

08:15.996 --> 08:16.328
Wow.

08:16.330 --> 08:19.231
...It's apparent
that a trend is emerging --

08:19.233 --> 08:23.068
One that continues
with the remaining two pairs

08:23.070 --> 08:24.135
Of age-matched pitchers.

08:24.137 --> 08:25.337
The guys are throwing faster,

08:25.339 --> 08:29.774
But the girls are hitting
the target more accurately.

08:30.109 --> 08:33.979
But only the final tally
will tell the full tale.

08:33.981 --> 08:36.881
The results are in, and they're
really pretty interesting.

08:36.884 --> 08:38.450
The females, as it happens,

08:38.452 --> 08:41.419
Are more accurate
than the males by 17%.

08:41.421 --> 08:43.621
But in the speed department,

08:43.624 --> 08:47.325
The boys were able to throw
15% faster than the girls.

08:47.327 --> 08:50.929
I know. It's like these two
numbers cancel each other out.

08:50.931 --> 08:52.664
But watching them,
it strikes me

08:52.666 --> 08:55.734
That there may be more
than speed and accuracy

08:55.736 --> 08:57.435
To how people throw.

08:57.503 --> 09:01.573
To that end, back when Jamie and
I worked in special effects...

09:01.575 --> 09:03.174
We frequently utilized
a technology

09:03.176 --> 09:07.546
That we think might give us
the best view yet...

09:07.548 --> 09:08.980
Of whether or not
there's a difference

09:08.982 --> 09:11.216
Between the way men throw
and the way women throw.

09:11.218 --> 09:12.450
You ready to
get out of here?

09:12.452 --> 09:15.487
Let's do it.
All right.

09:17.323 --> 09:23.461
Next up, the conflict continues
with an age-old argument.

09:23.463 --> 09:25.664
All right.
First up for us is a classic.

09:25.666 --> 09:28.533
Women are better multitaskers
than men.

09:28.535 --> 09:29.267
Oh. You mean, like,

09:29.269 --> 09:31.570
Juggling many different
activities at once?

09:31.572 --> 09:31.970
Exactly.

09:31.972 --> 09:35.507
When it comes to performing
several tasks at once,

09:35.509 --> 09:38.610
The fairer sex
supposedly has more flair,

09:38.612 --> 09:43.715
But is it scientific fact
or urban folklore?

09:43.717 --> 09:45.383
All right.
This should be cool.

09:45.385 --> 09:47.819
Let's build
the ultimate multitasking test.

09:47.821 --> 09:50.522
We'll get 20 volunteers --
10 men, 10 women --

09:50.524 --> 09:52.591
And we'll have them both
juggle all sorts

09:52.593 --> 09:53.558
Of activities at once.

09:53.560 --> 09:54.492
Maybe we could do
something

09:54.494 --> 09:55.860
Like getting ready
for work --

09:55.862 --> 09:57.562
Making the bed,
getting dressed,

09:57.564 --> 09:58.663
Making lunch,
watching the kid,

09:58.665 --> 10:01.800
And getting out the door
in time to get to work.

10:01.802 --> 10:02.667
It's a good idea.

10:02.669 --> 10:06.004
Welcome to
the multitask assault course --

10:06.006 --> 10:07.606
A set of simultaneous tasks

10:07.608 --> 10:11.876
That will test the volunteers'
chore-juggling skills

10:11.878 --> 10:12.711
To the limit.

10:12.713 --> 10:14.646
So, we've set up a scenario
of getting ready

10:14.648 --> 10:16.548
And getting out the door
as soon as possible.

10:16.550 --> 10:18.483
So, you have to get out of bed,
make the bed.

10:18.485 --> 10:19.985
Then you gonna grab
your clothes.

10:19.987 --> 10:20.719
You're gonna iron them,

10:20.721 --> 10:21.753
And then you're gonna
get dressed.

10:21.755 --> 10:23.989
You're gonna wear your shirt,
your pants, and your shoes.

10:23.991 --> 10:26.291
Then it's time to make breakfast
and get lunch to go.

10:26.293 --> 10:28.827
You've got to toast your toast,
put butter on it,

10:28.829 --> 10:29.628
Make yourself a cup of tea,

10:29.630 --> 10:31.630
All the while
while making yourself a sandwich

10:31.632 --> 10:33.999
That includes lettuce, tomato,
ham, cheese,

10:34.001 --> 10:34.733
Mustard, and mayonnaise,

10:34.735 --> 10:37.569
Put it in a bag,
get it ready to go.

10:38.438 --> 10:39.804
And while you're doing that,

10:39.806 --> 10:40.939
You got to answer the phone,

10:40.941 --> 10:42.474
Answer any questions
we have for you,

10:42.476 --> 10:45.610
And make sure baby buster
doesn't make it out the door,

10:45.612 --> 10:47.879
All before the timer runs out.

10:47.881 --> 10:49.714
With the room ready to roll,

10:49.716 --> 10:52.317
The subjects are introduced
to the format

10:52.319 --> 10:53.652
And thoroughly briefed.

10:53.654 --> 10:54.252
Hello, everyone,

10:54.254 --> 10:57.022
And welcome to the "Mythbusters"
morning challenge.

10:57.024 --> 10:59.791
But crucially,
they're kept in the dark

10:59.793 --> 11:01.326
About the aim of the test.

11:01.328 --> 11:03.695
They're given
instructions on the chores

11:03.697 --> 11:06.097
They have to perform
and nothing more.

11:06.099 --> 11:08.099
However, Kari's in the know.

11:08.101 --> 11:11.536
All right, for this experiment,
we have 20 test subjects.

11:11.538 --> 11:12.937
We have 10 men
and 10 women.

11:12.939 --> 11:15.507
Now, they have to complete
all of their tasks

11:15.509 --> 11:16.207
In a set amount of time,

11:16.209 --> 11:18.410
But they can't do
all of these tests

11:18.412 --> 11:18.977
One at a time.

11:18.979 --> 11:20.445
Some of them have to
be done simultaneously,

11:20.447 --> 11:22.647
Like you have to wait
for the toast to toast,

11:22.649 --> 11:24.449
You have to wait
for the iron to heat up.

11:24.451 --> 11:28.119
This should not be
a very easy task to do.

11:29.188 --> 11:31.756
Especially
if you're Tory.

11:31.758 --> 11:35.260
To score
the tricky Tory-proof test,

11:35.262 --> 11:37.362
Each testee starts with 100

11:37.364 --> 11:39.597
And is penalized 10 points

11:39.599 --> 11:41.599
For every
multitasking infraction.

11:41.601 --> 11:43.968
And first up
and out of bed is linda.

11:43.970 --> 11:45.470
Go.

11:45.472 --> 11:48.006
There's only five minutes
on the clock,

11:48.008 --> 11:51.009
So managing the myriad of tasks
simultaneously

11:51.011 --> 11:52.811
Is the only route to success.

11:52.813 --> 11:56.681
And by immediately turning on
all the appliances,

11:56.683 --> 11:57.982
She's off to a great start.

11:57.984 --> 12:00.051
Oh. It looks
like the baby's awake.

12:00.053 --> 12:01.853
Come here, baby buster.
You're coming with me.

12:01.855 --> 12:04.556
But it's about to
get a lot tougher.

12:04.558 --> 12:06.057
While ensuring baby buster

12:06.059 --> 12:09.160
Never leaves the marked
safety zone unattended,

12:09.162 --> 12:11.696
A sandwich lunch has to be made,

12:11.698 --> 12:12.997
Toast and tea attended to,

12:12.999 --> 12:16.301
And then there's the first
of three calls from Kari.

12:16.303 --> 12:18.236
hello?

12:18.238 --> 12:20.772
10 times 4,
divided by 2?

12:20.774 --> 12:22.607
- 10 times 4 -- 20.
- Well done.

12:22.609 --> 12:24.642
They're not difficult questions,
but they're hard to do

12:24.644 --> 12:26.010
When you're doing,
like, three things at once.

12:26.012 --> 12:28.613
Yep.
It's an all-out mental workout.

12:28.615 --> 12:30.415
The thing that's great
about this test

12:30.417 --> 12:32.183
Is it stimulates so many
different parts of the brain

12:32.185 --> 12:35.120
Using all these
different challenges.

12:35.122 --> 12:36.955
You've got motor skills.

12:36.957 --> 12:38.323
You've got verbal skills,

12:38.325 --> 12:40.792
Communication,
doing math problems --

12:40.794 --> 12:43.728
All different parts
of the brain.

12:43.730 --> 12:45.130
And as the myth would suggest,

12:45.132 --> 12:48.600
Our first lady, linda,
is coping spectacularly well.

12:48.602 --> 12:52.504
Ironing while tending the baby
and tackling the trivia

12:52.506 --> 12:56.141
Is just one of her many
multitasking successes.

12:56.143 --> 12:57.242
Hello?

12:57.244 --> 13:00.245
You have red paint.
You mix yellow and blue paint.

13:00.247 --> 13:02.814
What color is the paint
you originally had?

13:02.816 --> 13:03.481
Red.
Perfect.

13:03.483 --> 13:08.119
And with time in hand, linda
calmly completes the course...

13:08.121 --> 13:09.821
Okay.
Come on, baby buster.

13:09.823 --> 13:10.522
Time to go to school.

13:10.524 --> 13:12.857
...Giving the girls
a great start.

13:12.859 --> 13:15.927
Linda, well done.
Thank you.

13:15.929 --> 13:18.730
You have a perfect score
of 100 points

13:18.732 --> 13:20.532
With three seconds
to spare.

13:20.534 --> 13:24.836
But that single data point
only tells linda's story.

13:25.639 --> 13:27.338
To compare women against men...

13:27.340 --> 13:28.473
Start.

13:28.475 --> 13:31.276
...An average across
a larger sample is needed.

13:31.278 --> 13:33.144
All right.
That's a quick start.

13:33.146 --> 13:34.746
Made the bed right away.

13:34.748 --> 13:37.348
And as the nine remaining
female volunteers

13:37.350 --> 13:41.853
Cope with the confusion
of the concurrent chores...

13:41.855 --> 13:43.354
One thing is clear to Tory.

13:43.356 --> 13:46.591
I'm starting to think there
might be something to this myth.

13:46.593 --> 13:49.194
She got him.
Unbelievable.

13:49.196 --> 13:49.961
She makes the save!

13:49.963 --> 13:54.699
It was so interesting to see how
these women tackled the test.

13:54.701 --> 13:57.769
Yeah, there were variations
in their abilities

13:57.771 --> 13:59.370
And how many mistakes
they made...

13:59.372 --> 13:59.871
Hello?

13:59.873 --> 14:03.041
What is 9 times 3,
plus 3?

14:03.043 --> 14:04.976
I don't know.

14:04.978 --> 14:06.444
But overwhelmingly,

14:06.446 --> 14:10.849
The women were able to
focus while multitasking.

14:10.851 --> 14:11.416
I'm impressed.

14:11.418 --> 14:14.385
Yep. With all
the women successfully dressed,

14:14.387 --> 14:17.455
The team is duly impressed...

14:17.457 --> 14:18.623
Yeah!

14:19.125 --> 14:21.793
...Which just leaves
all 10 of the scores

14:21.795 --> 14:26.898
To be tallied and totaled
into an imposing average of 72.

14:26.900 --> 14:30.969
I think a score of 72 is gonna
be pretty tough to beat.

14:30.971 --> 14:33.805
I mean, I saw a bunch
of competent women

14:33.807 --> 14:34.739
Doing what they do every day,

14:34.741 --> 14:37.208
Handle a ton of stuff
all at once,

14:37.210 --> 14:38.409
And do it with style.

14:38.411 --> 14:39.444
I think we might be kicking

14:39.446 --> 14:43.248
Some stubborn, dogmatic,
linear-thinking male butt

14:43.250 --> 14:44.215
Coming up here.

14:44.217 --> 14:45.850
I'm not biased or anything.

14:45.852 --> 14:47.318
Coming up on "Mythbusters"...

14:47.320 --> 14:48.820
This is the coolest
technology ever.

14:48.822 --> 14:53.491
Adam and Jamie shine
some industrial light & magic

14:53.493 --> 14:56.027
On the myth of the man throw.

15:00.299 --> 15:01.499
If men are from mars

15:01.501 --> 15:03.034
And women from venus,

15:03.036 --> 15:05.503
This episode of "Mythbusters"

15:05.505 --> 15:06.938
Is the war of the worlds,

15:06.940 --> 15:11.009
Where Adam and Jamie are testing
the contentious taunt,

15:11.011 --> 15:12.610
"You throw like a girl."

15:12.612 --> 15:17.215
And so far, the myth is looking
like a misogynist misnomer...

15:17.217 --> 15:18.016
Excellent.

15:18.018 --> 15:20.852
...Because the girls
may have less power,

15:20.854 --> 15:22.287
But they're more accurate.

15:22.289 --> 15:23.588
But the Mythbusters aren't done

15:23.590 --> 15:26.324
With this complicated
controversy just yet.

15:26.326 --> 15:31.129
They're lob laboratory
just got a double-barrel blast

15:31.131 --> 15:32.630
Of motion-picture science.

15:32.632 --> 15:34.432
We're here
at industrial light & magic --

15:34.434 --> 15:38.069
The preeminent visual-effects
company in the world.

15:38.071 --> 15:39.337
Now, over the last 37 years,

15:39.339 --> 15:42.073
They've had their hand
in around 300 films.

15:42.075 --> 15:45.677
Now, Adam and I used to work
here, and we've pulled a favor.

15:45.679 --> 15:47.045
We've asked for access

15:47.047 --> 15:51.482
To some very special
visual-effects technology.

15:51.484 --> 15:52.517
Special, indeed.

15:52.519 --> 15:56.154
It's state-of-the-art
motion-picture technology,

15:56.156 --> 15:56.821
And the guys will use it

15:56.823 --> 15:58.456
To illustrate
the motion of pitching.

15:58.458 --> 16:02.193
This is the industrial light
& magic motion-capture stage.

16:02.195 --> 16:04.796
What is motion capture, you ask?

16:04.798 --> 16:05.730
Well, it is a technology

16:05.732 --> 16:08.299
That allows the digital artists
here at ilm

16:08.301 --> 16:11.769
To take a human's performance
and render it digitally.

16:11.771 --> 16:14.939
All I need to do
is wear a crazy suit...

16:14.941 --> 16:16.240
Wow.

16:16.242 --> 16:18.810
Ooh! I'm iron man.

16:20.313 --> 16:22.013
...And the dots
all over this suit

16:22.015 --> 16:24.349
Are being picked up by cameras
around this room

16:24.351 --> 16:27.418
And turning me into
a 3-d rendered stick frame

16:27.420 --> 16:28.019
Right there.

16:28.021 --> 16:31.289
Look at that.
Whoo, technology!

16:31.291 --> 16:34.025
I am made of full stick frame.

16:34.027 --> 16:35.193
I love this place.

16:35.195 --> 16:38.796
A place uniquely geared
for the next experiment --

16:38.798 --> 16:43.501
A visual and anatomical
analysis of motion.

16:43.503 --> 16:45.503
You look like a ninja.

16:45.505 --> 16:46.537
Let's go.

16:46.539 --> 16:49.107
Each of the throwers
will be rendered

16:49.109 --> 16:50.641
Into 3-d digital skeletons

16:50.643 --> 16:51.442
For an accurate comparison.

16:51.444 --> 16:54.812
What they're doing is putting
these little reflective markers

16:54.814 --> 16:55.713
All over zoe,

16:55.715 --> 17:00.551
And it gives us a very clear,
geometrical understanding

17:00.553 --> 17:01.652
Of the movement of her joints,

17:01.654 --> 17:02.954
Which is what we need to have

17:02.956 --> 17:05.790
To be able to analyze
how she's throwing.

17:05.791 --> 17:07.492
Perfect. High five.

17:07.493 --> 17:09.527
Thanks so much for your help.
You're welcome.

17:09.529 --> 17:12.230
Once Adam, Jamie,
and the ilm team

17:12.232 --> 17:15.299
Capture the action
from the two youngest pitchers,

17:15.300 --> 17:17.635
It's the turn
of the 24-year-olds.

17:17.637 --> 17:22.339
And when they're all transformed
into 3-d digital skeletons...

17:22.342 --> 17:24.375
This is the coolest
technology ever.

17:24.377 --> 17:29.047
...The comparisons can begin,
starting with the 7-year-olds.

17:29.049 --> 17:33.451
We've analyzed the data
we got from the motion capture

17:33.453 --> 17:34.318
Of the 7-year-olds,

17:34.320 --> 17:36.554
And there's already,
even at that age,

17:36.556 --> 17:38.723
A pretty clear difference
in how they throw.

17:38.725 --> 17:42.060
The boy is going more horizontal
with his body,

17:42.062 --> 17:44.228
While the girl
is staying mostly upright.

17:44.230 --> 17:47.598
This difference is much more
clearly exemplified

17:47.600 --> 17:48.266
In the 24-year-olds.

17:48.268 --> 17:51.102
Yep, and a comparison
of the adults in action

17:51.104 --> 17:54.172
Shows the difference
is down to rotation.

17:54.174 --> 17:56.541
The girls bend forward
at the hips,

17:56.543 --> 17:59.377
Whereas the guys
twist aggressively

17:59.379 --> 18:01.879
Through the hips
and shoulders.

18:01.881 --> 18:02.580
Mechanically speaking,

18:02.582 --> 18:05.216
It's a method that delivers
much more momentum.

18:05.218 --> 18:07.552
But where does
the difference come from?

18:07.554 --> 18:09.120
Now, there are
a couple of theories

18:09.122 --> 18:11.989
As to why men would move
differently than the female.

18:11.991 --> 18:14.859
One is that they're just bigger
and more powerful.

18:14.861 --> 18:18.963
The other one is that females
evolved to carry children,

18:18.965 --> 18:22.266
And so they're not gonna move
quite as aggressively.

18:22.268 --> 18:24.936
But in any case,
these are two people

18:24.938 --> 18:27.505
That are not trained
as ball players,

18:27.507 --> 18:29.774
And there's a very distinct
difference

18:29.776 --> 18:30.608
On how they're moving.

18:30.610 --> 18:32.443
That's the crucial point.

18:32.445 --> 18:35.279
Our volunteers have had
no explicit training,

18:35.281 --> 18:37.682
And yet, when seen
in digital detail,

18:37.684 --> 18:40.585
The guys' technique
more closely resembles

18:40.587 --> 18:42.720
That of
our professional pitcher.

18:42.722 --> 18:45.623
The question is,
do boys simply pick it up

18:45.625 --> 18:47.725
By being exposed
to more ball sports?

18:47.727 --> 18:52.797
Adam and Jamie have
one more test to find out.

18:52.799 --> 18:53.297
We got to go.

18:53.299 --> 18:54.832
They're shutting
this building down.

18:54.834 --> 18:55.933
Really?

18:55.935 --> 18:57.435
Told you.

18:57.437 --> 18:58.102
Wow.

19:01.473 --> 19:05.443
Women, supposedly
the master multitaskers,

19:05.445 --> 19:08.312
Have fired
a formidable first shot.

19:08.314 --> 19:09.380
Yeah!

19:09.382 --> 19:13.718
So, we've tested 10 women,
and they've done really well.

19:13.720 --> 19:16.053
They're average is 72 points.

19:16.055 --> 19:17.388
Welcome.

19:17.390 --> 19:18.823
Now it's time for the men

19:18.825 --> 19:22.426
To do the same challenge
and see how well they do.

19:22.428 --> 19:23.427
fight.

19:23.429 --> 19:27.064
And first to fight
like a man is malcom.

19:27.066 --> 19:28.166
But from the get up and go,

19:28.168 --> 19:32.003
It's clear his approach
is distinctly linear.

19:32.005 --> 19:33.538
He's wasting a lot of time

19:33.540 --> 19:35.139
Going from the counter
to the floor.

19:35.141 --> 19:38.142
Yep. He's not so much
multitasking

19:38.144 --> 19:41.779
As tackling each task
sequentially.

19:41.781 --> 19:42.914
Hello?

19:42.916 --> 19:44.882
There are seven colors
in the rainbow.

19:44.884 --> 19:46.517
What is 2 plus 2?

19:46.519 --> 19:48.219
4.

19:48.221 --> 19:51.055
In a test designed
to reward multitasking,

19:51.057 --> 19:54.392
Stopping and taking a phone call
cost precious seconds,

19:54.394 --> 19:58.796
As does a stop-and-start
babysitting technique.

19:58.798 --> 19:59.263
Down you go.

19:59.265 --> 20:01.899
All of which means
he didn't have time

20:01.901 --> 20:04.135
To finish making his sandwich...

20:04.137 --> 20:06.304
Oops. I don't know
how to do that.

20:06.306 --> 20:09.307
...His breakfast,
or get dressed properly...

20:09.309 --> 20:12.009
- Oh, no!
- Two...One...

20:13.346 --> 20:16.247
...A combination
of multiple infractions

20:16.249 --> 20:19.550
That leaves him with a score
of just 50 points --

20:19.552 --> 20:20.985
An ominous sign for the men.

20:20.987 --> 20:24.989
They have to up their game
to get in the game.

20:25.592 --> 20:27.491
That's the farthest
he's gotten.

20:27.493 --> 20:29.460
But as the clock
and cameras roll

20:29.462 --> 20:30.861
For the nine
remaining contestants,

20:30.863 --> 20:33.998
It's clear the guys
are out of their depth.

20:35.201 --> 20:36.033
I'm sorry?

20:36.035 --> 20:37.235
A few perform
as well as the girls,

20:37.237 --> 20:40.571
Juggling obstacles
like the phone and buster.

20:40.573 --> 20:41.072
Hello?

20:41.074 --> 20:43.608
If "A" squared
plus "B" squared

20:43.610 --> 20:44.742
Equals "C" squared,

20:44.744 --> 20:46.744
How do you spell
"green"?

20:46.746 --> 20:50.314
G-r-e-e-n.

20:50.316 --> 20:55.052
Perfect. Yes!
That was fantastic.

20:55.054 --> 20:57.154
Shoes, phone,
saves the baby.

20:57.156 --> 21:01.292
But most are "one thing
at a time" kind of guys.

21:01.294 --> 21:02.660
Hello?

21:02.662 --> 21:03.761
Uh...

21:03.763 --> 21:06.063
Jobs that can be tackled
simultaneously

21:06.065 --> 21:09.600
Become a series
of time-consuming interruptions.

21:09.602 --> 21:13.904
What is 2 plus 2,
times 3?

21:17.810 --> 21:20.978
And with points deducted
for incomplete tasks

21:20.980 --> 21:24.382
And for each time buster escapes
his safe zone...

21:24.384 --> 21:25.983
Oh. That's
an infraction.

21:25.985 --> 21:28.185
Do you have kids?
No, I don't.

21:28.187 --> 21:28.953
Thank god.

21:28.955 --> 21:30.688
...The poor scores
are racking up.

21:30.690 --> 21:34.225
And with buster packed
off for school one last time,

21:34.227 --> 21:37.128
Tory is ready and waiting
with the crunch numbers.

21:37.130 --> 21:39.864
Drumroll, please.

21:39.866 --> 21:40.598
So, the results are in.

21:40.600 --> 21:44.001
The women came away
with an average of 72 points,

21:44.003 --> 21:47.405
While the men came away
with an average of 64 points,

21:47.407 --> 21:49.507
So it looks like
this myth is confirmed.

21:49.509 --> 21:53.411
Ooh. So women can multitask
better than men.

21:53.413 --> 21:55.112
Confirmed.
Totally confirmed.

21:55.114 --> 21:56.380
All right.
Confirmed.

21:56.382 --> 21:58.215
The numbers don't lie.

21:58.217 --> 22:02.586
The average accurately reflects
the girls' multitasking mastery,

22:02.588 --> 22:05.856
Meaning this myth,
just like baby buster,

22:05.858 --> 22:07.858
Has been put to bed.

22:11.330 --> 22:13.097
Next on "Mythbusters"...

22:13.099 --> 22:13.731
I'm so lost.

22:13.733 --> 22:16.233
...Men --
are they really incapable

22:16.235 --> 22:17.802
Of asking for help?

22:19.000 --> 22:25.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

22:27.846 --> 22:33.150
Before Adam and Jamie wrap up
their high-tech tossing tale...

22:33.152 --> 22:35.219
This is the coolest
technology ever.

22:35.221 --> 22:38.889
...They're going to tackle
a marital skirmish

22:38.891 --> 22:40.591
That never fails to escalate.

22:40.593 --> 22:44.962
When the man of the car
is lost and not found,

22:44.964 --> 22:47.431
Suburban folklore
would have us believe

22:47.433 --> 22:51.836
That there's one thing his pride
will prevent him from doing.

22:52.638 --> 22:56.340
Jamie's lost, and he's asking
for directions.

22:56.342 --> 22:58.776
That is the opposite
of what most people think

22:58.778 --> 23:00.411
A man would do
in this situation.

23:00.413 --> 23:02.413
In fact,
there's a prevalent myth

23:02.415 --> 23:05.583
That men bullheadedly refuse
to ask for directions

23:05.585 --> 23:06.283
When they get lost.

23:06.285 --> 23:09.720
It's a myth that we are going to
put to the test

23:09.722 --> 23:10.888
Right in this episode.

23:10.890 --> 23:12.089
Think you know
where we are?

23:12.091 --> 23:14.125
Yep, I'm good.
Excellent.

23:14.127 --> 23:15.593
Here we go.

23:19.231 --> 23:20.097
And after a quick change

23:20.099 --> 23:21.732
Into something
a little more comfortable,

23:21.734 --> 23:25.336
The plan to test
this contentious clichÃ©

23:25.338 --> 23:28.005
Is simple and sneaky.

23:28.007 --> 23:28.773
A bunch of volunteers,

23:28.775 --> 23:31.575
Stripped
of gps technology or maps,

23:31.577 --> 23:33.778
Will be misdirected and lost,

23:33.780 --> 23:36.781
And Adam and Jamie
will monitor them

23:36.783 --> 23:38.549
To see who stops for help.

23:38.551 --> 23:40.084
The volunteers won't know this,

23:40.086 --> 23:42.386
But the test actually starts
right here.

23:42.388 --> 23:43.053
All you have to do

23:43.055 --> 23:45.923
Is follow these directions
to get there.

23:45.925 --> 23:47.625
Now, the first set
of instructions

23:47.627 --> 23:49.427
They'll be getting is correct.

23:49.429 --> 23:51.328
But by the time
they get to this intersection,

23:51.330 --> 23:54.131
We've given them a left turn
that totally doesn't exist.

23:54.133 --> 23:56.967
This is ground zero,
where they're gonna get lost,

23:56.969 --> 23:59.703
And we have seeded
the entire area

23:59.705 --> 24:00.838
with volunteers.

24:00.840 --> 24:02.440
If they ask for directions,

24:02.442 --> 24:03.874
These guys are gonna give them
to them.

24:03.876 --> 24:08.646
So, the driving draftees
will be asked to find their way

24:08.648 --> 24:09.213
From here to here

24:09.215 --> 24:11.449
Using a series
of written instructions.

24:11.451 --> 24:14.518
But one deliberately
false directive --

24:14.520 --> 24:15.986
A nonexistent almond street --

24:15.988 --> 24:19.356
Will ensure that by the time
they hit this intersection,

24:19.358 --> 24:23.627
They'll be lost,
and that's where the fun begins.

24:25.730 --> 24:27.698
Immediately
after they start driving,

24:27.700 --> 24:29.266
I'll be hiding
in this blind corner

24:29.268 --> 24:30.468
Right around the corner

24:30.470 --> 24:32.736
So I can follow them
at a reasonable distance

24:32.738 --> 24:35.406
And see exactly
when they ask for directions

24:35.408 --> 24:36.874
If they ask for directions.

24:36.876 --> 24:41.912
To find out, our first
lady is given her instructions.

24:41.914 --> 24:44.014
And away we go.

24:44.016 --> 24:45.382
As she pulls away,

24:45.384 --> 24:47.885
Adam,
a discreet distance behind,

24:47.887 --> 24:49.587
Drops into position on her tail.

24:49.589 --> 24:52.223
The setup might seem elaborate,

24:52.225 --> 24:53.791
But it's important
that the drivers don't know

24:53.793 --> 24:54.492
They're being tested.

24:54.494 --> 24:58.062
We don't want to affect
their behavior in any way.

24:58.064 --> 24:59.129
I'm chasing our volunteer.

24:59.131 --> 25:01.866
Once they reach
the nonexistent almond street,

25:01.868 --> 25:04.835
We want to see how long
it would naturally take for them

25:04.837 --> 25:06.403
To pull over and ask for help.

25:06.405 --> 25:08.339
And here we go.

25:08.341 --> 25:10.741
Left on almond.

25:10.743 --> 25:13.511
Despite dutifully
following the instructions,

25:13.513 --> 25:17.114
Our willing volunteer
is now officially lost.

25:17.116 --> 25:19.283
Subject has
just passed the intersection.

25:19.285 --> 25:21.752
Subject has passed
the intersection.

25:21.754 --> 25:23.454
We're like secret agents.

25:23.456 --> 25:24.989
Emerald.

25:24.991 --> 25:26.891
Where is almond?

25:28.760 --> 25:30.394
What's...Darn it. Okay

25:30.396 --> 25:34.498
And after a quick u-turn reveals
she really is lost

25:34.500 --> 25:36.834
In deepest, darkest suburbia...

25:36.836 --> 25:39.937
Um...Let's see
if it's the other direction.

25:39.939 --> 25:44.174
...Test subject number one
does the sensible thing --

25:44.176 --> 25:47.411
She pulls over
and asks for help.

25:48.848 --> 25:50.581
Excuse me.

25:50.583 --> 25:51.248
Hi. I'm sorry.

25:51.250 --> 25:53.384
Can you help me, please?
I'm looking for almond.

25:53.386 --> 25:56.186
That's one-zip to the girls.

25:56.188 --> 25:57.288
Now how about the guys?

25:57.290 --> 26:00.658
According to the myth,
they don't give up so easily.

26:00.660 --> 26:03.594
Cat-and-mouse
with test subjects --

26:03.596 --> 26:04.762
My favorite sport.

26:04.764 --> 26:08.532
Once again,
the driver is thrown for a loop.

26:09.702 --> 26:13.871
And the team on his tail
waits to see what he does.

26:14.340 --> 26:17.141
And what he does
is get stressed...

26:17.143 --> 26:17.875
Oh, my god.

26:17.877 --> 26:20.110
I definitely need to
turn around.

26:20.112 --> 26:21.278
Oh,

26:21.280 --> 26:23.614
...Perform several u-turns...

26:23.616 --> 26:26.417
He's going back
to his original route.

26:27.520 --> 26:30.020
Okay, I started over.

26:30.022 --> 26:31.155
On edgehill.

26:31.157 --> 26:32.690
...Gets stressed some more...

26:32.692 --> 26:37.161
oh, god.
This is ridiculous.

26:37.163 --> 26:42.066
...And stubbornly, adamantly
refuses to ask for help.

26:42.068 --> 26:43.867
He is intrepid.
That's for sure.

26:43.869 --> 26:49.773
And he is fulfilling every
stereotype about a man driving.

26:49.775 --> 26:54.111
Got to be -- oh
did I get lost again?

26:55.881 --> 26:57.581
Huh.

26:59.418 --> 27:02.219
It's now been,
like, 13, 14 minutes.

27:02.221 --> 27:03.220
Okay, turning around.

27:03.222 --> 27:07.224
I am -- just ran away
with the "Mythbusters" car.

27:07.226 --> 27:08.325
Awesome.

27:08.327 --> 27:09.627
That was a perfect embodiment

27:09.629 --> 27:11.962
Of what this stereotype
is all about.

27:11.964 --> 27:13.097
Against all reason,

27:13.099 --> 27:14.264
The first guy kept
driving around,

27:14.266 --> 27:16.166
Trying to find a road
that didn't exist,

27:16.168 --> 27:18.969
And didn't want to stop
and ask for help.

27:18.971 --> 27:20.037
After 20 minutes of that,

27:20.039 --> 27:23.140
We put him out of his misery
and called the test.

27:23.142 --> 27:25.142
How you doing, andrew?
Good.

27:25.144 --> 27:27.978
So, how come you didn't ask
for directions?

27:27.980 --> 27:30.748
Well, they said follow
the directions to find you

27:30.750 --> 27:32.049
To get the test,
so I was like,

27:32.051 --> 27:35.419
"Oh, I got to be able to
at least get the test sites."

27:35.421 --> 27:36.120
Look, I have to admit.

27:36.122 --> 27:38.455
I came to this story
with a little bit of bias.

27:38.457 --> 27:40.557
I actually think
it's probably true.

27:40.559 --> 27:42.993
Oh, my god. I am so lost.

27:42.995 --> 27:45.596
So I am not surprised
by these initial results.

27:45.598 --> 27:47.631
But these are not
the final results.

27:47.633 --> 27:49.133
This is just one guy
and one girl.

27:49.135 --> 27:53.037
We're gonna build our conclusion
on testing a lot more people.

27:53.039 --> 27:53.604
I could be wrong.

27:53.606 --> 27:56.040
Coming up on "Mythbusters"...

27:56.042 --> 27:57.174
Oh!

27:57.176 --> 27:59.109
...It's parkageddon.

27:59.111 --> 28:03.614
That didn't sound good.

28:04.716 --> 28:06.617
What you are about to see
could be dangerous.

28:06.619 --> 28:07.551
We're trained
professionals,

28:07.553 --> 28:09.687
So please,
leave the mythbusting to us.

28:09.689 --> 28:12.690
I think
it's your turn to change him.

28:15.194 --> 28:17.928
Up next, a declaration of war

28:17.930 --> 28:18.929
That will surely end

28:18.931 --> 28:23.100
In fender benders
for both genders.

28:24.069 --> 28:24.935
What's with the gloves?

28:24.937 --> 28:26.904
I hear we're doing a battle
of the sexes story.

28:26.906 --> 28:32.176
We are, however, bad news is
it involves you parking cars.

28:32.178 --> 28:33.310
Why is that
a problem?

28:33.312 --> 28:35.045
Because we all know
how you drive.

28:35.047 --> 28:39.349
So, the myth is that women are
better at parking cars than men.

28:39.351 --> 28:41.952
is that ridiculous or what?

28:42.788 --> 28:47.391
At least we're better
at the sucker punch, huh?

28:49.461 --> 28:51.295
It's a controversial claim

28:51.297 --> 28:53.697
Based on an extensive
scientific survey.

28:53.699 --> 28:58.302
It states that women may take
slightly longer to park,

28:58.304 --> 29:00.170
But their calm,
methodical approach

29:00.172 --> 29:00.704
Is more accurate

29:00.706 --> 29:04.975
And they're more adept
at maneuvering into the space.

29:04.977 --> 29:08.345
The team can't wait
to tackle it, and here's how.

29:08.347 --> 29:10.280
For the parallel parking
challenge,

29:10.282 --> 29:12.015
We're bringing in
20 volunteers --

29:12.017 --> 29:13.150
10 men and 10 women,

29:13.152 --> 29:15.486
And this is how we're going
to score them

29:15.488 --> 29:16.987
On their parallel park.

29:16.989 --> 29:17.521
Centering --

29:17.523 --> 29:20.057
The center in between the front
and the back vehicle.

29:20.059 --> 29:24.128
The curb distance -- they must
be at a legal curb distance.

29:24.130 --> 29:24.828
We're going to deduct

29:24.830 --> 29:27.765
If they smash into the car
before or after them.

29:27.767 --> 29:30.567
They will fail if they actually
take off a bumper

29:30.569 --> 29:31.201
Or scrape the car.

29:31.203 --> 29:33.737
And how many times
they need to correct

29:33.739 --> 29:35.405
To get into the space.

29:35.407 --> 29:38.242
Tory and I
are both going to be judges

29:38.244 --> 29:40.711
So that there is no bias.

29:40.713 --> 29:41.912
With the rules revealed,

29:41.914 --> 29:45.082
First to kick off
the park-off is frank.

29:45.084 --> 29:47.684
I am an incredible
parallel parker.

29:47.686 --> 29:49.753
I can do it fast.
I can do it on a dime.

29:49.755 --> 29:50.754
I live
in the big city.

29:50.756 --> 29:51.655
I know
what I'm doing

29:51.657 --> 29:53.023
When it comes
to parallel parking.

29:53.025 --> 29:54.892
He's confident,
that's for sure.

29:54.894 --> 29:57.628
He better be a good parker
after all that talk.

29:57.630 --> 30:00.564
Despite the fact
there's no time limit,

30:00.566 --> 30:03.467
Frank heads for the space
like it's a race.

30:03.469 --> 30:04.434
Wow, he is in a hurry.

30:04.436 --> 30:05.736
He must have to
use the restroom.

30:05.738 --> 30:07.905
He's definitely
somebody from a city.

30:07.907 --> 30:08.639
Whoa!

30:08.641 --> 30:09.807
He's got a good angle,

30:09.809 --> 30:13.577
But his speed and overconfidence
costs him.

30:14.112 --> 30:14.511
Oh!

30:14.513 --> 30:16.446
That's a 10-point deduction...

30:16.448 --> 30:17.748
Okay,
we got a bump...

30:17.750 --> 30:18.282
Okay.

30:19.752 --> 30:20.984
...And an alarm.

30:20.986 --> 30:21.852
Oh!

30:21.854 --> 30:22.753
...And that's another 10.

30:22.755 --> 30:26.456
And with an additional
forward and back correction,

30:26.458 --> 30:27.991
That's 10 more.

30:27.993 --> 30:30.460
I bet you he thinks
that's an amazing park job.

30:32.897 --> 30:33.664
Perfect.

30:33.666 --> 30:34.464
Well, not really.

30:34.466 --> 30:37.367
In addition
to his 30-point deductions,

30:37.369 --> 30:40.704
His centering
isn't particularly centered.

30:40.706 --> 30:44.775
All right.
Front is nine inches.

30:44.777 --> 30:46.543
Perfectly square
would be 20 inches.

30:46.545 --> 30:52.382
So, a further 11-point deduction
leaves frank with a total of 59.

30:52.384 --> 30:54.484
So far, not a good start
for the men, I'm telling you.

30:54.486 --> 30:59.723
Up steps the starting driver
for team women, gwen...

30:59.725 --> 31:01.291
Okay, gwen.

31:01.293 --> 31:02.426
Here we go.

31:02.428 --> 31:04.394
...And she's much more cautious
than frank.

31:04.396 --> 31:06.196
She's doing pretty good.

31:06.198 --> 31:07.898
Maneuvering
with careful precision,

31:07.900 --> 31:10.868
Gwen makes the most
of the angle and space.

31:10.870 --> 31:12.870
She almost touched
but didn't touch.

31:12.872 --> 31:15.005
Look.
She's just readjusted.

31:15.007 --> 31:17.608
The impressive gwen
completes the park

31:17.610 --> 31:20.744
With a single 10-point
correction penalty,

31:20.746 --> 31:22.579
And the tale of the tape...

31:22.581 --> 31:23.180
20 inches.

31:23.182 --> 31:25.749
...Tells us gwen
is perfectly centered,

31:25.751 --> 31:28.352
Scoring an impressive 90 points.

31:28.354 --> 31:31.088
It's a tough act
for scott to follow...

31:31.090 --> 31:32.923
He's driving
very confidently.

31:32.925 --> 31:35.425
...And he carries on
where frank left off.

31:36.562 --> 31:37.194
Oh, we got a bump.

31:37.196 --> 31:39.029
He's also racing
to get into the space,

31:39.031 --> 31:42.299
And doesn't mind
using the cars on either side

31:42.301 --> 31:43.133
To nudge his way in...

31:43.135 --> 31:44.668
oh, geez.

31:44.670 --> 31:45.802
That's not good.

31:45.804 --> 31:48.338
...And with
a poor positioning score...

31:48.340 --> 31:49.840
Eight inches.
You impressed?

31:49.842 --> 31:52.843
...He posts a total
that's very similar to frank's,

31:52.845 --> 31:54.778
Meaning in this battle
of the sexes,

31:54.780 --> 31:57.848
The guys already have
their backs to the wall.

31:57.850 --> 32:00.651
The men seem to be
getting in the space

32:00.653 --> 32:01.418
With less maneuvers,

32:01.420 --> 32:05.455
But they're also crashing
into the cars as they do it,

32:05.457 --> 32:09.092
So really, who's better
at parking so far?

32:09.094 --> 32:11.395
If I'm one of the cars
parked on either side,

32:11.397 --> 32:13.964
I'm going with the women.

32:17.402 --> 32:18.101
Welcome back, passengers.

32:18.103 --> 32:20.837
We are testing the myth
that men are more reluctant

32:20.839 --> 32:22.372
To ask for directions
than women,

32:22.374 --> 32:24.574
And so far,
based on our sample size

32:24.576 --> 32:25.375
Of one man and one woman,

32:25.377 --> 32:27.878
It's looking
pretty good for the myth...

32:27.880 --> 32:29.379
I'm so lost.

32:29.381 --> 32:31.481
...But sample size
is everything in science.

32:31.483 --> 32:33.417
The more you have,
the better your results,

32:33.419 --> 32:34.851
So we're not gonna
leave it there.

32:34.853 --> 32:36.219
We're gonna test
a bunch more men

32:36.221 --> 32:36.954
And a bunch more women.

32:36.956 --> 32:42.859
Yep. With 12 more volunteers
to be led astray and lost...

32:42.861 --> 32:43.393
Hmm.

32:43.395 --> 32:45.662
...The result
is far from decided.

32:45.664 --> 32:47.898
So Jamie, the puppet master,

32:47.900 --> 32:50.233
Reprises
his string-pulling role...

32:50.235 --> 32:52.869
So, here are
the instructions.

32:52.871 --> 32:53.570
...And Adam continues

32:53.572 --> 32:56.707
His comically inept
secret surveillance...

32:56.709 --> 32:58.542
oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.

32:58.544 --> 33:00.410
did he see you?

33:00.412 --> 33:03.547
...But crucially,
after our driving draftees

33:03.549 --> 33:06.283
Hit the bermuda triangle...

33:08.454 --> 33:11.788
...Everyone,
gals and guys alike,

33:11.790 --> 33:12.889
Stop to ask for directions...

33:12.891 --> 33:16.193
Excuse me.
Do you know where almond is?

33:16.195 --> 33:16.760
Excuse me.

33:16.762 --> 33:19.062
Do you know where almond is?
Excuse me.

33:19.064 --> 33:20.864
Is there an almond street
around here?

33:20.866 --> 33:22.065
And...

33:22.067 --> 33:22.733
There she goes.

33:22.735 --> 33:25.836
...If our last
female volunteer, tammy,

33:25.838 --> 33:27.104
Stops and seeks help...

33:28.340 --> 33:31.141
...The girls
will have a clean record,

33:31.143 --> 33:32.209
The guys won't.

33:32.211 --> 33:33.610
Ah! I don't know
where I'm going.

33:33.612 --> 33:39.483
But as the clock ticks on
and tammy circles back again...

33:39.485 --> 33:40.317
Oh, yeah.

33:40.319 --> 33:42.619
...And again...

33:42.621 --> 33:44.454
Ah,

33:44.456 --> 33:45.589
Okay.

33:45.591 --> 33:48.258
...It's clear
that her frustration...

33:48.260 --> 33:50.127
Oh, my god. No.

33:50.129 --> 33:53.597
...Is not going
to turn into a plea for help,

33:53.599 --> 33:55.932
But a plea for candy.

33:55.934 --> 33:56.867
Fudge!

33:56.869 --> 33:58.502
And at the 20-minute mark,

33:58.504 --> 34:01.938
The team terminates
tammy's trauma,

34:01.940 --> 34:04.007
And the score is all tied,

34:04.009 --> 34:05.809
But Jamie has a solution.

34:05.811 --> 34:08.945
With one failure apiece,
we need a tie breaker,

34:08.947 --> 34:09.946
And time might just do it.

34:09.947 --> 34:13.050
If the men have an aversion
to asking for help,

34:13.052 --> 34:16.219
That reluctance
might just translate

34:16.221 --> 34:18.922
To them taking more time
before they stop.

34:18.924 --> 34:20.524
Over to Adam for the breakdown.

34:20.525 --> 34:25.429
Men drove for an average
of four minutes and 11 seconds

34:25.431 --> 34:26.463
Before asking for directions.

34:26.465 --> 34:31.768
Women drove for an average
of five minutes and 11 seconds

34:31.770 --> 34:33.335
Before asking for directions.

34:33.338 --> 34:33.904
That's right.

34:33.906 --> 34:37.741
The men asked for directions
20% sooner than the women.

34:37.743 --> 34:41.344
All that leads us
to call this myth...

34:41.346 --> 34:44.915
Thank you,
my silent friend.

34:49.887 --> 34:52.755
Kari and Tory
have been asking the question,

34:52.757 --> 34:56.326
"Which sex parks in the perfect spot?"

34:56.328 --> 34:58.929
And so far, it's looking good
for the gals...

34:58.931 --> 35:00.630
Oh!

35:00.632 --> 35:01.064
Oh.

35:01.066 --> 35:04.034
...With a commanding lead
on the scoreboard.

35:04.036 --> 35:06.703
But with justine
behind the wheel...

35:06.705 --> 35:07.471
Nope. No. No.

35:07.473 --> 35:09.306
This has all gone wrong.
That's a bump.

35:09.308 --> 35:11.975
...All goes curb up.

35:11.977 --> 35:14.377
Oh!

35:14.379 --> 35:15.946
Hmm, that's really close.

35:15.948 --> 35:17.781
She better
leave a note.

35:18.951 --> 35:20.150
Things get so bad,

35:20.152 --> 35:23.787
Tory even tries his hand
at some encouragement.

35:23.789 --> 35:25.055
You're doing great.

35:25.057 --> 35:26.123
You almost have it.

35:26.125 --> 35:26.957
Really?

35:26.959 --> 35:28.725
That was really nice
of you.

35:28.727 --> 35:29.860
Yeah.

35:30.862 --> 35:31.828
Oh, man.

35:32.798 --> 35:34.264
oh.

35:39.270 --> 35:40.437
Wow. That's --

35:40.439 --> 35:41.938
I'm speechless.
Wow.

35:41.940 --> 35:44.307
Yep. Drive up
on that curb. Do it.

35:45.611 --> 35:46.910
Whoops.

35:51.884 --> 35:54.050
You almost got it...

35:54.720 --> 35:58.188
...And by almost,
I mean miles away.

35:58.190 --> 36:01.691
Um, p.S., we've run out
of points to take away.

36:01.693 --> 36:05.162
Yep, justine's long list
of transgressions

36:05.164 --> 36:06.596
Means she scored zero...

36:06.598 --> 36:07.964
I don't know how to do this.

36:07.966 --> 36:10.767
...And she not so much finishes

36:10.769 --> 36:11.368
As gives up.

36:11.370 --> 36:14.371
Might not be called parallel,
but it's definitely parked.

36:14.373 --> 36:15.539
Uh...Yeah.

36:15.541 --> 36:17.174
I'm in the space, right?

36:17.176 --> 36:18.375
Yeah,
you're in the space.

36:18.377 --> 36:24.548
That was a license-revoking
parking job.

36:24.550 --> 36:26.516
Justine parked on the curb

36:26.518 --> 36:29.252
And may have ruined two cars
in the process.

36:29.254 --> 36:32.889
I stopped marking down her score
when we got to zero.

36:32.891 --> 36:37.827
The women's average took a hit,
and six tests later...

36:37.829 --> 36:38.695
17 inches.

36:38.697 --> 36:41.331
...The status quo
is in much the same state.

36:41.333 --> 36:43.733
The guys aren't
doing a whole lot right...

36:44.503 --> 36:45.535
Oh, big bump.
That was a bump.

36:45.537 --> 36:48.572
...But they're not
doing much wrong, either.

36:48.574 --> 36:49.539
Nice work.

36:49.541 --> 36:50.507
And the girls?

36:50.509 --> 36:53.109
Well, they veer and steer wildly

36:53.111 --> 36:54.477
Between brilliance...

36:54.479 --> 36:55.845
That was awesome.

36:55.847 --> 36:57.614
...And catastrophe.

36:57.616 --> 36:58.615
Oh!

36:58.617 --> 36:59.683
We have another bump.

37:00.919 --> 37:02.752
That didn't sound good.

37:02.754 --> 37:04.154
We're about halfway
through the test,

37:04.156 --> 37:05.889
And I got to say,
this is really interesting.

37:05.891 --> 37:08.525
We have some really great scores
from the women

37:08.527 --> 37:10.961
And some really bad scores
from the women...

37:12.864 --> 37:13.663
Oh, god! Really?!

37:13.665 --> 37:16.366
Can this woman see?

37:17.769 --> 37:19.336
Do you have
a license?

37:19.338 --> 37:19.869
I do.

37:19.871 --> 37:22.572
I-I-I'm terrible
at parallel parking.

37:24.076 --> 37:27.210
...Whereas the men
are kind of consistently

37:27.212 --> 37:27.911
Staying at the middle.

37:27.913 --> 37:31.715
So, when it averages out,
we're at a tie.

37:31.782 --> 37:35.552
After 10 park jobs,
the average is incredibly close,

37:35.554 --> 37:39.923
But there's a clear gender-based
difference in method.

37:39.925 --> 37:41.391
Oh!

37:41.927 --> 37:44.194
The men are generally faster,

37:44.196 --> 37:45.695
Don't mind the odd bump...

37:45.697 --> 37:46.196
Oh.

37:46.198 --> 37:47.931
Ooh!
That was a good bump.

37:48.433 --> 37:52.235
...And as a group, they seem
to have more confidence...

37:52.237 --> 37:53.103
Perfect.

37:53.105 --> 37:57.607
...While the women are more
cautious and methodical...

37:57.609 --> 37:58.508
Whoo-hoo!

37:58.510 --> 37:59.242
The difference

37:59.244 --> 38:00.877
Between their highs and lows...

38:00.879 --> 38:02.679
Oh, this is
a really bad angle.

38:02.681 --> 38:05.248
...Being a lack of confidence.

38:05.250 --> 38:08.518
I'm used to nudging my way in,
but when the alarm went off,

38:08.520 --> 38:10.020
I was a little...
Paranoid, you know,

38:10.022 --> 38:12.689
Someone would come out screaming
with a rake or something.

38:12.691 --> 38:15.158
The rest
of the afternoon speeds by

38:15.160 --> 38:17.294
In a blur of curb crawling,

38:17.296 --> 38:17.961
Car alarms...

38:17.963 --> 38:20.563
Sorry I hit your car.

38:20.565 --> 38:22.432
...And high-fivin'...

38:22.434 --> 38:23.533
Team men.

38:23.535 --> 38:26.870
...Leading
to a final revealing tally.

38:26.872 --> 38:28.438
All right,
so what are the results?

38:28.440 --> 38:31.374
All right, so, the women
came out with an average of 42.5

38:31.376 --> 38:35.412
And the men came out
with an average of 43.6 --

38:35.414 --> 38:36.046
A statistical tie.

38:36.048 --> 38:40.817
Yep, with just 1.1% difference,
statistically speaking,

38:40.819 --> 38:43.119
There's nothing in it,
and that means...

38:43.121 --> 38:46.189
Women being better parkers
than men -- busted.

38:46.191 --> 38:46.790
All right. Let's go.

38:46.792 --> 38:49.125
Oh, should we let Grant out
of the trunk?

38:49.127 --> 38:49.659
Yeah.

38:49.661 --> 38:51.928
That's probably
a good idea.

38:51.930 --> 38:52.429
Hey, wake up.

38:52.431 --> 38:56.566
We'll let you out when we get
back to san francisco.

39:06.477 --> 39:10.013
You may or may not know
that from 1998 to 2003,

39:10.015 --> 39:11.114
I actually worked
in the model shop

39:11.116 --> 39:12.949
Here at
industrial light & magic,

39:12.951 --> 39:14.551
And it's kind of like
a coming home

39:14.553 --> 39:15.352
For me
to be here today.

39:15.354 --> 39:19.856
Yeah! I bet you never saw
a giant baby do this before!

39:19.858 --> 39:21.925
Oh, look! I'm running!

39:21.927 --> 39:23.660
I've run into
a lot of old friends,

39:23.662 --> 39:25.362
Seen a lot of stuff
that I built,

39:25.364 --> 39:26.096
And here's one of them.

39:26.098 --> 39:29.132
This is a carousel that
I actually designed and built

39:29.134 --> 39:30.500
With a crew for the film, "A.I."

39:30.502 --> 39:33.203
You might not recognize it
'cause it is a scene

39:33.205 --> 39:35.338
That got deleted
from the final film,

39:35.340 --> 39:37.941
But I got about
two or three weeks

39:37.943 --> 39:40.110
To design and construct
this entire thing

39:40.112 --> 39:41.911
And then prep it
for being weathered

39:41.913 --> 39:44.247
By our fantastic group
of scenic painters.

39:44.249 --> 39:46.783
It's one of my favorite models
I got to work on,

39:46.785 --> 39:50.553
And I just ran into it
here in the hallway.

39:54.558 --> 39:57.494
Adam and Jamie
are back at the lob lab

39:57.496 --> 40:00.096
With some unfinished business.

40:00.098 --> 40:00.663
All episode long,

40:00.665 --> 40:02.832
We've been testing
"Throws like a girl".

40:02.834 --> 40:05.902
We've been looking
for an experimentally
provable difference

40:05.904 --> 40:09.105
Between the way that men throw
and the way that women throw.

40:09.107 --> 40:12.275
We've pitted eight test subjects
in four different age groups

40:12.277 --> 40:13.076
Against each other,

40:13.078 --> 40:16.446
And we've analyzed their throws
in a motion-capture stage,

40:16.448 --> 40:20.083
But still, still, we can't shake
this cultural generality

40:20.085 --> 40:22.051
That playing catch,
throwing a ball,

40:22.053 --> 40:24.287
Is a boy's game
and not a girl's game.

40:24.289 --> 40:28.258
How do you control for
that inherent cultural training?

40:28.260 --> 40:30.226
With this -- our final test,

40:30.228 --> 40:33.296
In which we are making all eight
of our test subjects

40:33.298 --> 40:34.497
Throw again,

40:34.499 --> 40:37.333
But with their left hand
this time.

40:37.335 --> 40:38.301
Yeah.

40:38.303 --> 40:40.003
Oh, it's gonna be so awkward.

40:40.005 --> 40:41.070
It may be awkward,

40:41.072 --> 40:44.474
But with the same setup
and scoring system as before,

40:44.476 --> 40:48.111
It will get to the heart
of this myth.

40:48.113 --> 40:49.746
We're gonna ask you
to do the same thing,

40:49.748 --> 40:51.080
But with
your left hand.

40:51.082 --> 40:51.581
All right.

40:51.583 --> 40:55.285
And as our eight volunteers
are put through their paces,

40:55.287 --> 40:58.488
It should be noted
that without practice,

40:58.490 --> 41:01.591
It's impossible to transfer
a learned athletic skill

41:01.593 --> 41:04.260
To your non-preferred hand...

41:04.262 --> 41:05.195
Oh, heads up!

41:05.197 --> 41:06.095
...Meaning this test

41:06.097 --> 41:10.700
Effectively cancels out
any subtle cultural training

41:10.702 --> 41:11.835
That may give the boys
an advantage.

41:11.837 --> 41:15.405
It's like they're throwing
a ball for the first time,

41:15.407 --> 41:19.742
And the numbers, when collected
and collated, are conclusive.

41:19.744 --> 41:21.044
This is interesting.

41:21.046 --> 41:23.313
The guys completely reversed
the result

41:23.315 --> 41:24.447
From the preferred-hand test.

41:24.449 --> 41:28.117
They're more accurate
by the girls by about 12%,

41:28.119 --> 41:29.319
But the girls are faster.

41:29.321 --> 41:33.490
It's marginal -- 4% --
but they are faster.

41:33.492 --> 41:34.624
But what about form?

41:34.626 --> 41:36.593
If you look at
our motion-capture data,

41:36.595 --> 41:38.161
It does seem quite clear

41:38.163 --> 41:40.597
That men throw
with a better technique.

41:40.599 --> 41:41.731
They throw with a technique

41:41.733 --> 41:44.067
That looks much more like
that of the pro pitcher,

41:44.069 --> 41:45.268
And when we removed
all that training

41:45.270 --> 41:49.005
And had our "blank slates" throw
with their non-dominant hand,

41:49.007 --> 41:50.073
Males and females threw

41:50.075 --> 41:51.941
With almost identical
techniques.

41:51.943 --> 41:55.411
This suggests strongly
that it is cultural --

41:55.413 --> 41:56.312
That it is training,

41:56.314 --> 41:58.081
And then,
when you remove that training,

41:58.083 --> 42:00.049
You level the playing field.

42:00.618 --> 42:04.387
To test this,
Jamie has one final fling.

42:04.389 --> 42:05.989
Meet jordan taylor.

42:06.691 --> 42:08.791
Jordan is a girl...

42:09.294 --> 42:12.962
...A pitcher
for the u.S. Softball team...

42:13.932 --> 42:15.532
...And jordan can throw.

42:15.534 --> 42:17.500
Her 65-mile-an-hour canons

42:17.502 --> 42:21.404
Hit the target
with unfailing accuracy,

42:21.406 --> 42:24.874
And her form
matches that of greg,

42:24.876 --> 42:26.476
The male pro pitcher.

42:26.478 --> 42:29.112
His larger frame
does mean greater speed,

42:29.114 --> 42:31.848
But in terms of precision
and technique,

42:31.850 --> 42:34.851
Jordan has it nailed.

42:34.853 --> 42:37.887
So, given the training,
there's no reason

42:37.889 --> 42:41.324
Women can't overcome
cultural bias

42:41.326 --> 42:43.793
And throw as well as the guys.

42:43.795 --> 42:44.661
Nice.

42:44.663 --> 42:45.995
How are we gonna
call it?

42:45.997 --> 42:47.096
Well, we set out
on this episode

42:47.098 --> 42:48.598
To see if we could
find a distinctive difference

42:48.600 --> 42:51.935
Between the way men throw a ball
and the way women throw a ball.

42:51.937 --> 42:52.835
And what
did we find?

42:52.837 --> 42:55.605
Well, we found that there is,
in fact, a distinct difference.

42:55.607 --> 42:56.539
Both our data
supported this

42:56.541 --> 42:57.974
And, more importantly,
the motion-capture data.

42:57.976 --> 43:01.044
We were able to clearly see
that, when throwing a ball,

43:01.046 --> 43:04.480
Women tend to stay more vertical
and throw like this,

43:04.482 --> 43:05.915
Whereas men
go more horizontal

43:05.917 --> 43:08.785
And rotate their bodies
more aggressively.

43:08.787 --> 43:09.886
But you know,
we really should deal

43:09.888 --> 43:12.422
With "throws like a girl"
as an insult.

43:12.424 --> 43:14.357
Indeed, we should,
and here's the big news --

43:14.359 --> 43:16.492
"Throws like a girl"
is not an insult.

43:16.494 --> 43:18.027
We did not find
in any of our testing

43:18.029 --> 43:20.196
That women throw
more poorly than men.

43:20.198 --> 43:21.831
Maybe now
we can put to bed

43:21.833 --> 43:24.601
"Throws like a girl"
as an insult.

43:24.603 --> 43:26.002
I surely hope so.

43:26.004 --> 43:26.836
