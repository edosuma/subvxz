WEBVTT

01:16.402 --> 01:20.123
Who's he?

01:22.087 --> 01:26.422
Wait at the bar.
This is no way to greet an old friend.

01:26.631 --> 01:29.097
You kept me waiting here for 2 weeks.

01:29.098 --> 01:34.680
Right! It's Paris. See the sights.

01:36.236 --> 01:37.817
I'm here for work.

01:37.818 --> 01:43.213
There's a lot of ground to cover.
Difficult terrain. Remote.

01:43.224 --> 01:46.656
They want me to send someone with you.

01:49.516 --> 01:52.489
Two men is a security risk.

01:55.267 --> 01:58.417
This is an important job.
There's no room for mistakes.

01:58.454 --> 02:01.763
So don't make any.

02:01.865 --> 02:06.968
It must be very nice for you.
Not to need anyone.

02:09.620 --> 02:14.214
<i>The client is Red Leaf.
A military biotech.</i>

02:14.299 --> 02:18.581
<i>They're after something
extremely rare.</i>

02:19.609 --> 02:21.852
<i>You're to bring back
biological samples.</i>

02:21.888 --> 02:25.869
<i>Blood, skin, hair, organs.</i>

02:28.137 --> 02:32.363
<i>As for the rest, make sure no
one else can ever find it.</i>

02:37.713 --> 02:40.480
<i>What Red Leaf wants
is very valuable.</i>

02:40.890 --> 02:42.352
Tasmanian Tiger.

02:42.353 --> 02:45.860
<i>But only if they have
exclusive ownership.</i>

02:48.126 --> 02:52.394
<i>You are looking for something
most believe is extinct.</i>

02:52.405 --> 02:56.973
<i>The rarest, most elusive
creature on the planet.</i>

02:57.683 --> 03:01.578
<i>The client has evidence
it still exists.</i>

03:01.579 --> 03:05.941
<i>If so, it may be the very last one.</i>

03:48.573 --> 03:53.659
THE HUNTER

04:23.687 --> 04:28.007
<i>The client has reports
from a reliable source.</i>

04:28.018 --> 04:32.225
<i>Two confirmed sightings
in the past year.</i>

04:33.994 --> 04:38.056
<i>Until now, these sightings
have been kept secret...</i>

04:38.092 --> 04:40.283
<i>...but word always gets out.</i>

04:43.043 --> 04:47.775
<i>We have only a couple of
months, maybe less.</i>

04:50.768 --> 04:53.991
<i>After that there will be competition.</i>

04:54.027 --> 04:57.749
Perhaps there already is.

05:47.616 --> 05:49.158
Hello?

05:56.851 --> 05:59.430
<i>Hey! What are you doing?</i>

05:59.466 --> 06:01.294
You can't wake her up.

06:01.295 --> 06:04.136
I'm Martin David, from the University.

06:04.137 --> 06:08.855
Hello, Martin David. My name's
Sass. This is my brother Bike.

06:08.925 --> 06:11.214
Mom said we should take
you to see your room.

06:11.485 --> 06:13.324
Come on.

06:21.998 --> 06:26.402
- Bulb's burned out.
- Nah... No fucking power.

06:27.371 --> 06:31.442
- Excuse me?
- It's the generator. Stopped working.

06:36.875 --> 06:39.038
You gonna fix it?

06:39.074 --> 06:41.877
I got a lot of equipment.
I need power.

06:43.830 --> 06:45.907
Yeh. Used to work, but it stopped.

06:45.944 --> 06:48.029
Dad says the fucken
fucker's completely fucked.

06:59.288 --> 07:02.958
- Where's your father?
- Gone away. Up there.

07:03.203 --> 07:08.242
He'll be back soon though.
He'll fix it if you can't.

07:16.849 --> 07:19.835
There's water in the cold tap.

07:20.971 --> 07:24.453
Oh, and the toilet's outside.

07:55.632 --> 08:00.917
- You right there mate?
- Ah, just need to use the restroom.

08:02.115 --> 08:04.768
You wanna drink first?

08:05.863 --> 08:07.493
Right.

08:07.784 --> 08:12.226
- Beer?
- Sure.

08:20.691 --> 08:24.963
SAVE OUR NATIVE FORESTS
( -- JOBS -- )

08:31.542 --> 08:36.092
- How much to rent a room?
- No vacancies.

08:36.099 --> 08:41.176
- Not even one small room?
- All regulars, mate .. Live-ins.

08:41.177 --> 08:43.058
I can pay double.

08:43.094 --> 08:46.371
Pay triple if you want.
Same difference.

08:47.106 --> 08:50.222
Hey, you!...
Hey, you!

08:51.244 --> 08:54.631
- You wanna room?
- Yeah.

08:54.739 --> 08:58.535
Yeah.
Well, you can't have one.

09:03.684 --> 09:08.731
- You're from overseas, aren't you? Some Uni?
- You got a room? I can pay.

09:08.928 --> 09:12.251
Nuh. The thing is... mate,

09:12.287 --> 09:15.310
We don't really like greenies around here.

09:15.316 --> 09:21.215
So, unless you want to join your mate,
Jarrah fucking Armstrong...

09:21.470 --> 09:23.719
...fuck off.

09:25.142 --> 09:29.409
- You're up Dougie.
- Coming.

09:55.619 --> 10:00.086
I've arrived. The lodging
is... not what I excepted.

10:00.087 --> 10:01.958
The communication may be a problem.

10:01.994 --> 10:05.682
So, I'll call when I have
something to report.

11:01.901 --> 11:04.020
What's she singing about?

11:05.025 --> 11:08.876
She sounds sad. Yelling like that.

11:10.147 --> 11:13.832
She's not yelling.
Don't you ever listen to music?

11:13.834 --> 11:16.275
Sure. My Dad likes "The Boss".

11:16.882 --> 11:18.208
Who?

11:18.220 --> 11:24.027
"The Boss". Bruce Springsteen. He rocks.

12:19.747 --> 12:22.408
Shouldn't come in here without knocking.

12:24.892 --> 12:27.105
You're looking for my dad?

12:27.106 --> 12:31.869
No, I'm researching Tasmanian devils.

12:31.879 --> 12:35.825
But if you see him, you'll
tell him to come home?

12:35.829 --> 12:41.897
I'll be up for twelve days, then I'll come back
for two days to resupply and do my paperwork.

12:41.905 --> 12:46.064
If I'm not back,
Wednesday next week...

12:46.072 --> 12:50.315
Take this, when you go up.

12:50.316 --> 12:52.615
You can keep it for while.

12:52.617 --> 12:58.388
Here's my Dad. We gave him that for
his birthday. It's what he looks like.

13:03.424 --> 13:05.900
Okay.

13:06.461 --> 13:08.974
44.30...

13:08.979 --> 13:13.868
Those are my coordinates. They're
points on the map. Now, listen.

13:13.905 --> 13:18.219
- When your mother wakes up...
- I know. Twelve days.

13:18.220 --> 13:20.806
Jack's here!

13:22.798 --> 13:25.726
- Where are my soldiers?
- Jack!

13:25.958 --> 13:30.460
Hey, little princess. Hi, mate.

13:31.304 --> 13:33.763
There he is.

13:35.376 --> 13:40.104
- G'day, Jack Mindy.
- Martin David. How's it going?

13:40.106 --> 13:42.186
- How's the room, alright?
- Yeah, it's fine, thanks.

13:43.240 --> 13:45.913
Any problems, just let me know,
I'll sort it out.

13:47.146 --> 13:51.649
It's a good spot for you here.
Quiet, convenient.

13:52.788 --> 13:55.707
Now, the blokes from the university
told me you needed a guide.

13:56.170 --> 13:58.671
- Really?
- Yeah. I can take can take you up there...

13:58.777 --> 14:00.967
- No, no, I, I don't...
- No, no, no, it's not problem.

14:01.592 --> 14:05.223
You can get your stuff and follow
me in your truck. Alright?

15:35.821 --> 15:37.750
Who were they?

15:37.891 --> 15:41.190
Blockade? It's Greenies
protesting the logging.

15:41.326 --> 15:45.161
- Jarrah started all that.
- The children's father?

15:45.162 --> 15:49.496
Jarrah, yeah. I've a lot of
time for Jarrah, he's a good bloke,

15:50.113 --> 15:51.617
eco-warrior.

15:54.528 --> 15:57.518
- Where is he now?
- He went missing last summer.

15:57.519 --> 16:02.513
He was out doing his university
work, he never came back down.

16:02.514 --> 16:06.505
- Didn't the university tell you?
- Different university.

16:07.031 --> 16:11.430
Anyway. It was a bloody nightmare
Search & Rescue was out for two weeks...

16:12.358 --> 16:14.344
...not a trace.

16:14.962 --> 16:16.654
And his wife?

16:17.141 --> 16:22.624
Lucy is not doing too good. She's
...um, I do what I can to help.

16:23.347 --> 16:25.852
Your rent money will
go a long way.

16:32.143 --> 16:35.721
This is all earmarked for logging.

16:39.935 --> 16:44.129
- What is it you're studying?
- Devils.

16:44.447 --> 16:46.889
Dunno why, they're pests.

16:46.926 --> 16:50.524
Still, makes a change.

16:52.277 --> 16:53.695
From what?

16:53.732 --> 16:57.613
We get a lot of tourists this way
looking for the Tassie tiger.

16:57.789 --> 17:00.686
They think they can take
a bit of a day trip...

17:00.722 --> 17:03.272
...and find an animal that's
been written off as extinct.

17:04.681 --> 17:08.825
- What do you think?
- I heard one once.

17:11.451 --> 17:14.292
I was a kid. I was up trapping with my dad.

17:14.329 --> 17:17.944
50 years ago but I still remember it.

17:17.944 --> 17:20.317
Every now and again some clown reckons
he sees one but...

17:20.354 --> 17:24.174
...no one can ever prove it.

17:31.468 --> 17:34.301
Not a Sunday stroll up where you
want to go Mr. David.

17:34.338 --> 17:38.045
Part of it is highlands. Never been mapped.

17:38.612 --> 17:43.538
There are satellite maps alright, but it
doesn't mean anyone's ever been there.

17:44.602 --> 17:48.027
What do you think happened
to Jarrah Armstrong?

17:48.031 --> 17:55.355
Slipped, fell, broke
a leg, froze, starved...

17:55.365 --> 17:57.800
And then the devils got him.

17:57.837 --> 18:00.854
Eat you alive if you give 'em a chance.

18:00.920 --> 18:04.252
Odd, though, not to find a trace.

18:04.289 --> 18:07.760
Well, depends if anyone
wanted a trace left.

18:08.257 --> 18:10.420
Made a few enemies, Jarrah.

18:10.738 --> 18:13.264
He was a foreigner, like yourself.

18:13.265 --> 18:16.085
Wanted to save the trees.

18:16.330 --> 18:20.601
Logging trees is the only reason
there's any people here at all.

18:20.602 --> 18:24.984
For a town. So you can imagine
when he arrived a few years back
he was as popular as...

18:25.085 --> 18:27.886
...a snake in a sleeping bag.

18:46.120 --> 18:51.538
- Good Lord!
- Good Lord indeed, Mr. David.

18:54.291 --> 18:57.513
Thank you, Mr. Mindy.
I'll take it from here.

18:57.614 --> 18:59.915
You what?

19:00.627 --> 19:03.950
I'd like to go on alone.

19:04.738 --> 19:09.329
- Are you sure? It's...
- Yes, I'm sure.

19:11.924 --> 19:14.883
Well, suit yourself.

19:16.050 --> 19:21.468
I'll leave you to it then.
See you in a couple of weeks.

19:21.469 --> 19:24.302
And watch your step.

25:17.827 --> 25:22.528
<i>GO HOME GREENIE SCUM</i>

26:15.018 --> 26:17.601
G'day.

26:20.770 --> 26:22.853
You're back then.

26:22.855 --> 26:26.019
- You get what you needed?
- Sort of.

26:28.273 --> 26:31.596
- Seen many "devils"?
- Yes.

26:31.609 --> 26:34.396
Sick or healthy?

26:34.400 --> 26:36.984
Healthy.

26:38.819 --> 26:44.769
Oh well, don't let me stand in your way.
Just brought 'round some supplies.

26:45.572 --> 26:49.192
Your dinner's in the kitchen.

27:10.582 --> 27:16.460
- Is that your father?
- Which? Oh, yeah, he did it.

27:16.669 --> 27:21.039
- Why is scratching his head?
- He's not.

27:21.045 --> 27:26.167
He's looking for something. But
you'd never guess what for.

27:26.172 --> 27:30.042
- A way out of here?
- A tiger.

27:30.049 --> 27:32.884
Really? A tiger?

27:34.301 --> 27:37.767
- What kind of tiger?
- A Tasmanian tiger.

27:37.969 --> 27:40.032
A Tasmanian tiger?

27:40.069 --> 27:45.395
- That's very interesting, but you
know, they don't exist. - Do so.

27:46.598 --> 27:51.469
- They're extinct
- Are not! My dad saw one last summer. It's a secret.

27:51.475 --> 27:57.097
He must have told somebody about it.
Somebody else besides you?

27:57.102 --> 28:02.053
- Have other people seen it?
- I do not know. Ask him.

29:09.841 --> 29:15.764
Hello. I hear you're doing some
research on the plateau, "Devils", right?

29:16.469 --> 29:20.088
- Yes, that's right.
- Very cool.

29:20.095 --> 29:25.263
- I'm Free by the way. This is Simon.
- How's it going?

29:25.265 --> 29:28.732
You should stop by some time.
We'd love to hear about your work.

29:29.033 --> 29:30.834
I'm sorry, but I won't have any time.

29:30.934 --> 29:34.221
You're not using traps up
there, are you? Steel traps?

29:34.222 --> 29:36.633
No. I won't do that.

30:10.950 --> 30:12.908
Thanks.

30:13.826 --> 30:18.151
I bet you helped your dad too.

30:23.331 --> 30:27.280
What is that? A monkey face?

30:45.340 --> 30:48.003
OK. Here goes nothing.

33:54.961 --> 34:00.413
- Where did these come from?
- It's a prescription from a doctor.

34:00.422 --> 34:03.666
Jack Mindy brings them.

34:05.424 --> 34:09.967
Your mother doesn't need
these anymore. So, no more, OK?

34:10.168 --> 34:11.869
OK.

34:14.011 --> 34:17.550
Go run a bath.

34:35.896 --> 34:39.342
Sass, here, help me.

34:39.355 --> 34:41.971
Get her legs.

34:41.981 --> 34:47.649
I have to go back up tomorrow. You're
going to have to take care your mother.

34:47.650 --> 34:50.518
- She's gonna feel sick.
- OK.

34:50.525 --> 34:55.192
Give her lots of tea, and water
and let her rest.

34:56.735 --> 34:59.104
- OK?
- OK.

35:35.754 --> 35:38.541
Out!

35:39.880 --> 35:42.793
You can't come with me.

35:47.050 --> 35:50.715
You know these are
exctint. They're gone.

35:51.719 --> 35:56.886
I don't know what your father told
you but he couldn't have seen one.

35:56.887 --> 35:59.346
Come on.

36:02.099 --> 36:07.549
Ok, if I see one,
you'll be the first to hear.

42:47.102 --> 42:51.177
- Where's your mother?
- In town with Jack Mindy.

42:51.186 --> 42:55.808
She's better now. Did you find anything?

42:59.357 --> 43:02.270
It's not my dad's.

43:44.542 --> 43:46.259
- What are you doing?
- We're going in.

43:46.360 --> 43:49.461
- No, you can't.
- But we always do.

43:49.661 --> 43:53.207
- Wait until I finished.
- No, the water'll be cold.

43:53.777 --> 43:56.953
Besides, my dad says when
we have a bath it's shame...

43:57.054 --> 43:58.254
...to waste all the hot water.

43:58.256 --> 44:02.581
I am not your dad and I do not
think your mom would like this.

44:02.592 --> 44:04.832
- He tells us a story.
- I do not know any.

44:05.033 --> 44:06.234
- None?
- No.

44:06.335 --> 44:08.035
- Not even one story?
- No.

44:08.136 --> 44:13.212
- What she keeps singing about then?
- She's just singing.

44:13.220 --> 44:17.104
'bout what though? People
never sing about nothing.

44:17.229 --> 44:19.906
I've never met someone does it.

44:20.016 --> 44:23.430
She can't sing a song about nothing.

44:23.435 --> 44:27.053
So what's she singing about?

44:29.478 --> 44:33.097
<i>He's back.</i>

44:33.104 --> 44:38.055
- I'll better come in.
- I'll be fine.

44:38.065 --> 44:40.934
I'll see you soon.

44:42.701 --> 44:45.445
Thanks.

45:08.682 --> 45:11.677
Want some water?

45:13.436 --> 45:17.352
- Hi.
- Hi, Mom.

45:18.733 --> 45:23.401
They do not like to waste the hot water.

45:23.403 --> 45:27.149
- You guys hungry?
- Yes.

45:27.156 --> 45:29.571
I'll get dinner ready.

45:48.718 --> 45:51.963
A tiger in the trees.

45:54.641 --> 45:59.889
Which trees? There are
lots of trees out there.

46:07.385 --> 46:11.774
The winters up here are something else,
especially when the snow comes.

46:11.781 --> 46:14.820
- Shiraz? ( Wine? )
- No.

46:14.824 --> 46:17.899
He drinks tea.

46:17.911 --> 46:20.951
- Jamie! Dinner is ready.
- Jamie?

46:20.954 --> 46:26.815
- His new name's Bike.
- Bike? Not a bad name.

46:27.127 --> 46:31.124
What about you, Katie?
Do you have a new name?

46:31.131 --> 46:36.256
- Sass. From "Sassafras".
- That's very pretty.

46:36.261 --> 46:39.882
- Jamie?
- I'll go get him.

46:42.599 --> 46:45.890
Hey... time to eat.

47:05.244 --> 47:08.302
- So, Mr. David...
- Call me Martin.

47:08.303 --> 47:12.473
Martin, how's the study going?
Those Devils giving you much trouble?

47:12.474 --> 47:15.507
No. Not too much trouble.

47:15.544 --> 47:19.380
- I'm getting...
- Oh, Katie, that's disgusting! Sorry.

47:19.382 --> 47:23.333
- He likes it stronger.
- Like Jarrah.

47:23.344 --> 47:26.259
My husband only liked tea
if it was the colour of rust.

47:26.263 --> 47:30.510
- Have you read his book?
- No, I haven't but it's on the top of my list.

47:30.517 --> 47:34.309
Run and get daddy's book.

47:38.440 --> 47:40.692
So, what do they teach in
zoology these days Martin?

47:40.728 --> 47:44.327
Same stuff. Hasn't changed
much in the past ten years.

47:47.240 --> 47:53.073
Do you know Jude Morris? He's from
your neck of the woods,... Columbia, right?

47:54.538 --> 48:00.414
I couldn't find it. I'm Finished.
Can you tell us a story?

48:00.419 --> 48:03.715
- Martin and I will just have to have a little chat.
After that... - You promised.

48:03.716 --> 48:06.903
After we've had our talk...

48:17.601 --> 48:22.225
Katie said that you
washed me. In the bath.

48:22.231 --> 48:24.598
The children helped.

48:31.071 --> 48:34.271
I am not a bad mother.

48:35.492 --> 48:38.407
It's just hard.

48:42.749 --> 48:48.168
What are those speakers in the trees?
Up there.

48:49.754 --> 48:52.015
Umm. Jarrah.

48:52.052 --> 48:55.691
He wanted to have concerts
up here when we first moved.

48:56.803 --> 49:01.928
He had this idea that everyone could gather
here, artists, scientist, town's people...

49:01.932 --> 49:05.303
...like a little Woodstock.

49:05.310 --> 49:08.351
He had lots of ideas.

49:08.355 --> 49:12.682
Too many.
Too many to hold in his head at once.

49:23.868 --> 49:27.444
We're lucky Jack sent you.

54:33.787 --> 54:37.952
Hey everybody, this is Martin David,
like I told you.

54:37.953 --> 54:39.689
Hello.

54:40.931 --> 54:42.418
What happened to your eye?

54:43.410 --> 54:46.835
- Caught a stick in it.
- Gross-ish.

54:46.979 --> 54:51.397
- Where's your mother?
- She's inside. In the kitchen.

54:53.630 --> 54:54.866
What's going on?

54:55.010 --> 54:57.481
- We having a little Woodstock?
- You're back!

54:58.564 --> 55:02.349
- Your eye ...oh god! What happened?
- It's fine

55:02.361 --> 55:04.874
Come and sit down.

55:06.652 --> 55:09.289
Sit down.

55:16.392 --> 55:19.198
It's not too deep.

55:20.932 --> 55:25.631
We got a moratorium... for the logging
in the forest down the road...

55:25.636 --> 55:31.507
Forrestry aren't allowed to touch it for 6 months
not until there's a complete ecologic survey.

55:34.799 --> 55:38.179
- We're celebrating.
- They're friends of yours?

55:38.182 --> 55:43.337
I helped them with their proposal,
interpreted some of their research.

55:46.766 --> 55:50.800
I was doing my PhD in Plant
Science when I met Jarrah.

55:52.998 --> 55:55.838
Ecophysiology.

55:57.703 --> 56:00.835
You look different.

56:00.838 --> 56:04.422
Oh, this? Yeah I had it done in town.

56:04.428 --> 56:09.826
- Do you like it?
- I liked it better before.

56:20.806 --> 56:26.883
And this has all the signs of a tiger kill.
She eats the heart first.

56:29.640 --> 56:32.392
And this is the cave.
She's been there.

56:32.429 --> 56:35.989
She probably has dens all around the
area, and she moved between them...

56:36.000 --> 56:39.334
...but sooner or later
she'll move back here.

56:40.272 --> 56:43.747
I wonder if she's the
last one. Alone. Just...

56:43.759 --> 56:47.217
...hunting and killing, waiting to die.

57:14.199 --> 57:17.506
Go on.
We won't tell the University.

57:18.648 --> 57:20.559
No.
Thanks, I'm fine.

57:22.526 --> 57:26.358
Guess you will be heading home soon
since you got what you wanted.

57:26.395 --> 57:28.950
Nah, got offered a job.
Him 'n me.

57:29.790 --> 57:32.861
- Working for the government.
- Searching for tigers.

57:34.238 --> 57:37.972
- National Parks found a footprint.
- Shhh. It's fucking top secret!

57:39.064 --> 57:40.578
And we know the area, so...

57:41.939 --> 57:43.498
There's no tigers up there.

57:43.535 --> 57:47.809
- You don't know that. You only know what they want you to know. 
- Mmmm, Here we go.

57:49.161 --> 57:54.233
We'd be sitting on a pile of money if you found
one man, I'm telling you. Cloning and shit.

57:54.238 --> 57:59.308
You're a scientist. What would
you do if you found a tiger?

58:00.428 --> 58:01.922
Not my field.

58:02.337 --> 58:05.898
I'd just point his nose due west
and tell him to run like the wind.

58:05.935 --> 58:08.757
That's what Jarrah would've done.

58:08.764 --> 58:11.898
Isn't that right Luce?

58:27.624 --> 58:31.943
- Take the kids inside.
- Come on. Katie. Come on.

58:40.881 --> 58:42.869
Listen, fellows...

58:43.109 --> 58:44.474
It's not personal.

58:45.389 --> 58:47.509
Taking away our jobs is personal mate.

58:47.812 --> 58:50.077
- Come on man, there're women & children here.
- Shut up Feral.

58:50.078 --> 58:51.512
Hey, you don't want to do that mate.

58:52.131 --> 58:53.827
Yeah.

58:54.388 --> 58:56.682
Ah, Run you little fairies.

59:18.313 --> 59:19.595
Come in.

59:19.938 --> 59:21.667
I'm making tea. Would you like some?

59:21.704 --> 59:24.500
- No, thank you.
- You sure?

59:24.503 --> 59:29.892
No. I'm gonna turn it. I got to
go back up early tomorrow morning.

59:31.932 --> 59:34.860
Sorry about tonight.

59:35.151 --> 59:40.593
Do you think those people have
something to do with y... your husband?

59:40.598 --> 59:45.361
No. They're angry that they're out
of work but they wouldn't hurt us.

59:45.545 --> 59:48.831
Their kids go to school with my kids.

59:51.078 --> 59:54.813
Jarrah thought that somebody
was following him though.

59:54.849 --> 59:56.855
Not one of the locals.

59:58.055 --> 01:00:02.133
Well, if not them, who?

01:00:03.213 --> 01:00:06.256
My husband pissed off a lot of people.

01:00:06.266 --> 01:00:11.258
- Did you tell the police?
- Yeah, they said there was no evidence.

01:00:11.260 --> 01:00:17.109
No, uhh, body. Besides, they knew Jarrah,
his theories, what he was like. So, ...

01:00:17.616 --> 01:00:21.610
Do you believe someone was following him?

01:00:21.731 --> 01:00:25.597
I believe he believed it.

01:00:57.960 --> 01:01:00.325
How is it going Mr. Mindy?

01:01:00.949 --> 01:01:03.892
Hear you had a bit of trouble
up at the house last night?

01:01:03.928 --> 01:01:05.405
Everything is under control.

01:01:07.205 --> 01:01:10.276
Maybe I should talk
to the University...

01:01:10.286 --> 01:01:15.698
...find you somewhere else to live,
somewhere with fewer distractions.

01:01:15.700 --> 01:01:21.496
Lucy is better. She is off the
pills and the kids are fine too.

01:01:21.905 --> 01:01:25.316
I don't think you need
to come around so much.

01:02:20.345 --> 01:02:24.582
- Hello?
- This is Jack Mindy from Tasmania.

01:02:24.619 --> 01:02:29.102
- Yes, Jack? - You said to call
if there was any problems. - Go on.

01:02:29.970 --> 01:02:34.687
<i>Well, this scientist of yours,
he's... He's becoming a problem.</i>

01:04:43.284 --> 01:04:44.799
<i>Mum</i>

01:05:42.340 --> 01:05:44.170
Beer, please.

01:05:45.130 --> 01:05:49.200
Didn't think you'd be back in here.

01:05:49.210 --> 01:05:52.085
Why aren't you up there with
all your other greenie mates, ha?

01:05:53.792 --> 01:05:58.533
I know what you're up to mate.
Whole fucking town knows about it.

01:06:00.412 --> 01:06:03.699
It's a bloody waste of taxes.

01:06:08.866 --> 01:06:12.903
You and that fucking Armstrong
bitch deserve each other.

01:06:15.945 --> 01:06:17.900
Let him go!

01:07:56.542 --> 01:08:00.034
'kay. Good boy.

01:08:13.708 --> 01:08:19.247
- My Dad was going to fix those.
- Just helping him out, while he's away.

01:08:19.250 --> 01:08:23.573
- Can I help too?
- Sure.

01:08:58.456 --> 01:09:43.448
# MUSIC: Vivaldi <i>Gloria In Excelsis Deo</i>

01:09:58.417 --> 01:10:00.954
Thank you!

01:10:06.333 --> 01:10:12.659
- What kind of work was your husband doing up there?
- I don't know if you call it work...

01:10:12.667 --> 01:10:16.455
Was he working for Red Leaf?

01:10:17.875 --> 01:10:22.790
I saw their name on the back of
some of the drawings. On the fridge.

01:10:22.792 --> 01:10:28.367
I thought he burnt it all.
He got very paranoid about, umm.

01:10:28.375 --> 01:10:33.369
- Why?
- He was hunting a tiger up there.

01:10:33.375 --> 01:10:40.076
He told me that the tiger had some
unique toxin that paralyzed its prey.

01:10:40.083 --> 01:10:44.577
And that Red Leaf wanted to own it.
The DNA.

01:10:44.583 --> 01:10:47.700
Jarrah was trying to stop them.

01:10:50.458 --> 01:10:54.576
It's probably better off extinct.

01:10:54.583 --> 01:11:00.909
If its alive people would always
want to find it. Hunt it down.

01:11:02.542 --> 01:11:07.866
- Mum? I can't sleep.
- What's the matter Katie?

01:11:07.875 --> 01:11:13.074
- I'm scared, I want to sleep in your bed, with you.
- Okay, I'm coming.

01:11:13.083 --> 01:11:17.430
Listen. If it's a nice day tomorrow,
do you want to go on a picnic?

01:11:17.986 --> 01:11:18.986
Yeah.

01:11:22.083 --> 01:11:24.699
- Good night.
- 'Night.

01:11:36.750 --> 01:11:40.197
- Can we bring the chook?
- No! - Why not?

01:11:40.208 --> 01:11:44.201
Because, ...
I don't even know what a chook is.

01:11:44.208 --> 01:11:47.871
Chooks... the chickens!

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:55.118
Oh, My, Lord. Look at you!

01:11:57.417 --> 01:12:01.330
Are you sure you want to be seen with us?

01:12:12.833 --> 01:12:17.406
Oh, okay, you want him?
It's is for you.

01:12:19.792 --> 01:12:22.659
He's coming...

01:12:24.542 --> 01:12:28.911
<i>- Martin David.
- I'm hearing reports.</i>

01:12:28.917 --> 01:12:33.142
<i>You're attracting too much attention,
getting involved with locals.</i>

01:12:35.458 --> 01:12:40.532
<i>You need to focus on the job,
or someone else will get there first.</i>

01:12:40.542 --> 01:12:46.742
I've found a cave...
a kind of den. I've been there.

01:12:46.750 --> 01:12:50.072
<i>Why aren't you up there now?</i>

01:12:50.083 --> 01:12:53.655
<i>You need a result.</i>

01:12:54.750 --> 01:12:57.822
You'll get your result.

01:13:05.625 --> 01:13:08.116
Exscuse me.

01:13:21.417 --> 01:13:26.036
- What are you doing?
- I have to go back up.

01:13:26.042 --> 01:13:30.706
- I have to finish my work. I have no choice.
- What about the kids?

01:13:30.708 --> 01:13:35.657
- These are my coordinates, if I'm not back...
- Don't bother.

01:18:53.535 --> 01:18:57.133
Get down on your knees,
face away from me.

01:19:08.723 --> 01:19:11.794
Where's the cave?

01:19:11.805 --> 01:19:14.136
What cave?

01:19:17.856 --> 01:19:19.508
Hands by your sides, palms up.

01:19:35.340 --> 01:19:38.661
Where is the cave?

01:19:47.462 --> 01:19:51.283
- Up there.
- How far?

01:19:53.044 --> 01:19:56.615
Two hour climb.

01:20:01.458 --> 01:20:04.495
You're going to take me there.

01:20:13.163 --> 01:20:15.904
Let's go!

01:20:15.912 --> 01:20:19.324
I can't navigate like this.

01:24:06.098 --> 01:24:08.430
Jack!

01:24:09.847 --> 01:24:12.633
Jack?

01:24:13.349 --> 01:24:15.596
You stay there! You stay there!

01:24:18.970 --> 01:24:23.667
- Don't you make me.
- Where are they?

01:24:26.626 --> 01:24:29.477
It was an accident. Police...

01:24:30.454 --> 01:24:31.535
...said it was an accident. All the...

01:24:32.765 --> 01:24:38.441
candles, & lanterns, open fire up at that
place, was bound to happen sooner or later.

01:24:38.477 --> 01:24:40.334
Where are they now, Jack?

01:24:49.885 --> 01:24:53.448
Lucy and the girl... they're dead.
They're. They're dead.

01:25:04.568 --> 01:25:06.327
And the boy?

01:25:07.498 --> 01:25:12.490
They took him away. I couldn't
look after him, not at my age.

01:25:14.163 --> 01:25:17.950
We'll find him a place, somewhere good...

01:25:27.493 --> 01:25:32.190
Was someone paying you to
follow me, to keep an eye on me?

01:25:32.199 --> 01:25:37.022
No. I thought you were
a scientist, like Jarrah.

01:25:37.032 --> 01:25:40.194
No one was paying me.

01:25:41.280 --> 01:25:44.943
You should never've come here.

01:25:44.945 --> 01:25:48.391
What did you tell them, you idiot?

01:25:48.404 --> 01:25:53.067
They sent someone to replace me.
They'll send someone to replace him...

01:25:53.069 --> 01:25:57.515
...and they'll keep on sending people
until they get what they want.

01:34:05.682 --> 01:34:09.628
What you want is gone forever.

01:34:09.639 --> 01:34:14.507
Don't bother looking for me.
I'm going to see the sights.
