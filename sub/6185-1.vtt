WEBVTT

00:02.252 --> 00:04.960
(footsteps pattering)

00:08.467 --> 00:11.880
(suspenseful music)

00:13.889 --> 00:15.630
I got your
text, Rainbow Dash.

00:15.807 --> 00:17.047
Did something come
through the portal?

00:17.267 --> 00:18.803
Is Equestrian
Magic on the loose?

00:19.019 --> 00:20.509
Did Twilight come
back with a problem

00:20.729 --> 00:22.219
that only we can solve?

00:22.439 --> 00:24.225
Has a giant cake monster
covered all the cakes

00:24.441 --> 00:26.148
in the world in cake?

00:26.360 --> 00:28.943
Um, not exactly.

00:29.154 --> 00:30.986
Uh, I don't understand.

00:31.198 --> 00:33.781
Well Sunset, I was just
telling Rainbow Dash here

00:33.992 --> 00:36.780
that a broken guitar string
doesn't really qualify

00:36.995 --> 00:38.110
as an emergency.

00:38.330 --> 00:39.570
It totally does!

00:39.790 --> 00:40.996
Really, Rainbow Dash?

00:41.208 --> 00:42.744
I was in the middle of
sewing a very complex

00:42.960 --> 00:44.542
appliqué on my latest frock!

00:44.753 --> 00:46.539
And I was just about
to tuck everyone in

00:46.755 --> 00:47.916
for the night at the shelter.

00:48.131 --> 00:50.543
Now we'll have to start
stories all over again.

00:50.759 --> 00:53.126
Why would you send all
of us an emergency text

00:53.345 --> 00:54.710
for a guitar string?

00:54.930 --> 00:56.716
Well I was going
to pony up and show

00:56.932 --> 00:58.843
our fans some
awesome guitar licks.

00:59.059 --> 01:01.801
But I kinda need all
six strings to do it.

01:02.020 --> 01:03.306
Got any extra?

01:03.522 --> 01:04.727
(all groan)

01:05.816 --> 01:07.648
Here, but everyone
finished practicing

01:07.859 --> 01:10.271
for the day, I'm pretty sure
all the music rooms are locked.

01:10.487 --> 01:12.774
No problem, the
acoustics in the hallway

01:12.990 --> 01:14.822
are perfect for power chords.

01:15.033 --> 01:16.114
(electric guitar music)

01:16.326 --> 01:17.657
Come on, let's go!

01:19.454 --> 01:20.785
You coming, Sunset?

01:20.998 --> 01:22.739
I'll catch up in a bit.

01:29.715 --> 01:31.547
Dear Princess Twilight,

01:31.758 --> 01:33.294
how's life treating
you in Equestria?

01:33.510 --> 01:35.126
Any cool new magic spells?

01:35.345 --> 01:37.302
It's been pretty quiet
here at CHS since

01:37.514 --> 01:39.596
the Battle of the
Bands; we still pony up

01:39.808 --> 01:42.049
when we play music,
which Rainbow Dash

01:42.269 --> 01:43.680
just loves to show off.

01:43.895 --> 01:45.602
But I still can't quite
grasp what it's all about.

01:45.814 --> 01:47.805
I would love to hear
what you think about it

01:48.025 --> 01:49.015
when you get a sec.

01:49.234 --> 01:50.850
Your friend, Sunset Shimmer.

02:03.915 --> 02:04.825
(screeching)

02:05.042 --> 02:07.704
(suspenseful music)

02:16.803 --> 02:17.713
Hey!

02:19.848 --> 02:21.430
What are you doing?

02:21.642 --> 02:22.473
Wait!

02:22.684 --> 02:24.095
Stop!

02:24.311 --> 02:25.676
(brakes screech)

02:31.068 --> 02:32.229
Who was that?

02:50.754 --> 02:53.712

(electric zapping)

05:29.246 --> 05:31.783

05:56.523 --> 05:58.230
She was definitely
doing something

05:58.441 --> 06:00.023
to the statue, or was going to.

06:00.235 --> 06:02.647
Do you think she came through
the portal from Equestria?

06:02.863 --> 06:05.605
No, I'm pretty sure
I would've noticed that.

06:05.824 --> 06:07.155
I think she was from over here.

06:07.367 --> 06:08.778
Well that's a relief.

06:08.994 --> 06:11.076
The last thing we need is
another magical so-and-so

06:11.288 --> 06:14.076
bent on world domination
coming over from Equestria.

06:15.959 --> 06:17.199
Agreed!

06:17.419 --> 06:18.625
I have no interest in
another fight against

06:18.837 --> 06:20.168
She was definitely
doing something

06:20.380 --> 06:21.620
The wear and tear on my wardrobe

06:21.840 --> 06:23.672
is just too much
to keep up with.

06:23.884 --> 06:26.751
Still, a mysterious figure
snooping around the portal?

06:26.970 --> 06:28.756
Don't you want to know
what she was up to?

06:28.972 --> 06:29.757
(whimpers)

06:29.973 --> 06:31.338
I don't even want to guess.

06:31.558 --> 06:33.720
Well you don't
have to, because

06:33.935 --> 06:35.676
I've totally figured
out who it was.

06:35.896 --> 06:37.887
Oh, a nighttime
statue cleaner?

06:38.106 --> 06:39.767
A magical portal
maintenance maintainer?

06:39.983 --> 06:41.439
A gardner?

06:41.651 --> 06:43.267
Seeing as how
they got off a bus

06:43.486 --> 06:45.568
from the city, and
got back on a bus

06:45.780 --> 06:49.398
headed to the city,
I'll bet they go to...

06:49.618 --> 06:51.609
Crystal Prep.

06:51.828 --> 06:52.693
Yep!

06:52.913 --> 06:54.153
With the Friendship
Games starting tomorrow

06:54.372 --> 06:56.704
they totally tried to
prank us by defacing

06:56.917 --> 06:58.328
Oh, a nighttime
statue cleaner?

06:58.543 --> 06:59.783
Why would anyone take a bus

07:00.003 --> 07:01.664
all the way from
the city for that?

07:01.880 --> 07:03.791
Because the Crystal
Prep Shadowbolts

07:04.007 --> 07:05.088
are our biggest rivals.

07:05.300 --> 07:06.540
Because that's
just what the students

07:06.760 --> 07:07.841
of Crystal Prep would do!

07:08.053 --> 07:10.340
Because even though
they beat us in everything:

07:10.555 --> 07:13.013
soccer, tennis, golf,

07:13.224 --> 07:14.806
they still have to gloat!

07:16.561 --> 07:17.892
Seems kinda silly to me.

07:18.104 --> 07:19.560
Silly?

07:19.773 --> 07:23.016
So I guess you think the
Friendship Games are silly too?

07:23.234 --> 07:24.645
Well it's not like
we'll be fighting

07:24.861 --> 07:26.067
the powers of evil magic.

07:26.279 --> 07:28.020
No, we'll be fighting against

07:28.239 --> 07:29.821
a school full of meanies.

07:30.033 --> 07:32.695
Not everything has to be
magical to be important.

07:32.911 --> 07:34.322
Soccer, tennis, golf,

07:34.537 --> 07:35.902
I know it's a big deal.

07:36.122 --> 07:37.704
Woo, that's putting
it mildly, darling.

07:37.916 --> 07:40.783
They're still revamping the
playing field in preparation.

07:41.002 --> 07:43.790
I just don't understand
why there's this big rivalry.

07:44.005 --> 07:46.042
Aren't the Friendship
Games supposed to be about

07:46.257 --> 07:47.668
our two schools getting along?

07:47.884 --> 07:49.716
Well it's kinda hard
to get along with someone

07:49.928 --> 07:51.510
who beats you at everything.

07:51.721 --> 07:52.836
Not anymore!

07:53.056 --> 07:55.138
This time things are
gonna be different.

07:55.350 --> 07:56.465
What do you mean?

07:56.685 --> 07:58.392
Oh, you'll find out.

07:58.603 --> 08:00.594
(dramatic music)

08:00.814 --> 08:02.725
As I am sure you all know,

08:02.941 --> 08:04.557
tomorrow Canterlot High School

08:04.776 --> 08:05.857
will be hosting
our fellow students

08:06.069 --> 08:07.810
from Crystal Prep Academy

08:08.029 --> 08:09.736
who beats you at everything.

08:09.948 --> 08:11.780
Of excellence, sportsmanship,

08:11.992 --> 08:15.576
and fidelity to compete
in the Friendship Games.

08:15.787 --> 08:18.620
(non-enthusiastic cheering)

08:18.832 --> 08:21.540
Since the games only
happen every four years

08:21.751 --> 08:24.459
I'm sure you're all
curious what goes on.

08:24.671 --> 08:27.254
You mean other
than us losing?

08:27.465 --> 08:30.799
And that is
exactly why I've asked

08:31.011 --> 08:32.626
Rainbow Dash to come
up and give you all

08:32.846 --> 08:35.679
a little, um, context.

08:35.890 --> 08:37.631
Thank you Principal Celestia.

08:37.851 --> 08:39.182
(clears throat)

08:39.394 --> 08:41.179
I know a lot of you might think

08:41.395 --> 08:43.433
there's no way we
can beat a fancy

08:43.648 --> 08:46.436
school like Crystal
Prep at anything.

08:46.651 --> 08:48.813
Unless it's a Losing to
Crystal Prep competition,

08:49.029 --> 08:50.940
because we're
really good at that.

08:51.156 --> 08:52.396
(sighs)

08:52.615 --> 08:54.982
And I know that
CHS has never won

08:55.201 --> 08:57.488
the Friendship Games even once.

08:57.704 --> 08:59.160
Oh dear, I hope
this speech isn't meant

08:59.372 --> 09:00.658
to be motivational.

09:00.874 --> 09:03.662
Crystal Prep students
are super athletic,

09:03.877 --> 09:05.834
super smart, and
super motivated.

09:06.046 --> 09:07.957
But there's one
thing they aren't:

Oh, Rainbow Dash,

11:30.315 --> 11:33.433
that was amazing!

11:33.651 --> 11:35.187
Even I feel like we can win.

11:35.403 --> 11:38.612
I feel like my school
pride is at an all-time high!

11:38.823 --> 11:40.439
Is anybody else
wondering how Dash

11:40.658 --> 11:42.649
ponied up without
playing her guitar?

11:42.869 --> 11:43.654
I know, right?

11:43.870 --> 11:46.487
It's probably because
I'm so awesome!

11:46.706 --> 11:47.616
Maybe.

11:47.832 --> 11:49.493
I mean you are awesome,

11:49.709 --> 11:51.700
but there's gotta be more
to it than that, right?

11:51.920 --> 11:53.911
It just seems so random.

11:54.130 --> 11:55.746
Well it would be
nice if you girls

11:55.965 --> 11:56.955
could get a handle on it.

11:57.175 --> 11:58.791
We'd like to keep
magic as far away

11:59.010 --> 12:00.671
from the Friendship
Games as possible.

12:00.887 --> 12:02.753
We don't want to be
accused of cheating.

12:03.765 --> 12:05.722
We don't need magic to defeat

12:05.934 --> 12:07.766
those hoity-toity
Crystal Preppers!

12:07.977 --> 12:09.763
(cheering, laughing)

12:09.979 --> 12:12.596
Still, the Friendship
Games are serious business.

12:12.815 --> 12:14.522
We don't want any surprises.

12:14.734 --> 12:17.146
Especially the kind that
could cause us to forfeit.

12:17.362 --> 12:19.444
Sunset Shimmer,
you came here from

12:19.656 --> 12:22.273
a world of magic, perhaps
you can get to the bottom

12:22.492 --> 12:24.108
of our magical development.

12:24.327 --> 12:25.692
I'll do my best.

12:27.580 --> 12:29.617
Okay, anybody
have any guesses

12:29.832 --> 12:30.913
what the events are gonna be?

12:31.125 --> 12:32.456
Pie eating? Cake eating?

12:32.669 --> 12:34.660
(gasps) Pie-cake eating!

12:34.879 --> 12:36.119
They won't even let
us see what they're doing

12:36.339 --> 12:38.751
to the field, you'd think
they'd at least tell competitors

12:38.967 --> 12:40.298
what they're competing in!

12:40.510 --> 12:42.342
It could be anything.

12:42.553 --> 12:43.634
Anything?

12:43.846 --> 12:45.678
How will I ever pick
the right outfit?

12:45.890 --> 12:46.880
I really want to help, but

12:47.100 --> 12:48.511
I think I better go focus on

12:48.726 --> 12:50.683
figuring out why
Rainbow Dash ponied up.

12:50.895 --> 12:52.477
See ya later!

12:52.689 --> 12:54.646
Seems like she's got
everything under control.

12:54.857 --> 12:56.723
Nothing to worry about.

13:06.703 --> 13:07.659
(groans)

13:15.712 --> 13:16.793
Hey Twilight,

13:17.005 --> 13:18.336
haven't heard back from you yet.

13:18.548 --> 13:19.583
I guess you must be pretty busy

13:19.799 --> 13:21.460
with your role as Princess.

13:21.676 --> 13:23.337
I could really use
your advice right now.

13:23.553 --> 13:25.544
You see, I've been giving
the job of keeping magic

13:25.763 --> 13:28.721
under control here at CHS,
even though I still haven't

13:28.933 --> 13:31.595
quite wrapped my head around
it, and now after seeing

13:31.811 --> 13:33.722
Rainbow Dash pony
up the way she did,

13:33.938 --> 13:35.724
it makes me think
our magic might be

13:35.940 --> 13:37.226
changing-

13:37.442 --> 13:39.353
Everyone is looking to
me to figure things out

13:39.569 --> 13:41.776
and I really don't
want to let them down.

13:41.988 --> 13:43.604
But I'm not sure I
have enough experience

13:43.823 --> 13:45.689
with friendship
magic to solve this.

13:49.704 --> 13:51.160
(school bell rings)

13:58.588 --> 14:01.751
(upbeat music)

14:05.219 --> 14:06.755
(sighs)

14:07.388 --> 14:08.594
Excuse me.

14:08.806 --> 14:10.092
(bang)
Sorry.

14:12.935 --> 14:13.925
Pardon me!

14:27.533 --> 14:29.149
(dog whimpers)

14:29.369 --> 14:30.325
Spike!

14:30.536 --> 14:31.776
Spike!

14:31.996 --> 14:33.737
(barks)
(giggling)

14:33.956 --> 14:34.661
There you are.

14:35.958 --> 14:37.323
Okay, okay-

14:39.962 --> 14:42.078
Last night's field test
confirmed it, Spike.

14:42.298 --> 14:43.914
With this device I
can track and contain

14:44.133 --> 14:46.295
the bizarre energy coming
from Canterlot High!

14:46.511 --> 14:48.047
(growling, barking)

14:48.262 --> 14:49.844
I know you didn't like
me going over there,

14:50.056 --> 14:51.421
but I just couldn't wait!

14:51.641 --> 14:53.803
And soon I'll have
all the time I need.

14:54.018 --> 14:55.759
All of Crystal Prep
is gonna be there

14:55.978 --> 14:57.013
for the Friendship Games.

14:57.230 --> 14:58.971
I just hope all that
rivalry nonsense

14:59.190 --> 15:00.806
doesn't get in the
way of my research!

15:01.025 --> 15:03.357
If I can collect enough
data on these EM frequencies

15:03.569 --> 15:05.651
I should be able to
extrapolate the waveforms

15:05.863 --> 15:06.819
to determine their origin!

15:07.031 --> 15:08.772
That would practically
guarantee my entrance

15:08.991 --> 15:10.732
into the Everton
Independent Study Program!

15:10.952 --> 15:11.532
(Yelps)

15:11.744 --> 15:13.360
(knocking)

15:16.707 --> 15:19.790
Twilight, you know
the rules against pets.

15:20.002 --> 15:22.585
Well Spike isn't
a pet, Dean Cadance.

15:22.797 --> 15:24.754
He's the focus of
my research project.

15:24.966 --> 15:27.924
Human-canine co-habitation
effects and implications.

15:28.136 --> 15:29.752
If you say so.

15:29.971 --> 15:31.632
But Principal Cinch
is highly allergic,

15:31.848 --> 15:33.464
so I suggest you put
on a clean shirt.

15:33.683 --> 15:34.639
Why?

15:34.851 --> 15:36.182
Because she wants to see you.

15:36.394 --> 15:39.432
Oh, maybe she has news about
my application to Everton!

15:39.647 --> 15:41.638
I've been meaning to
talk to you about that.

15:41.858 --> 15:44.065
Are you sure that's
what you really want?

15:44.277 --> 15:45.688
Why wouldn't it be?

15:45.903 --> 15:47.268
A program that
allows me to focus

15:47.488 --> 15:48.728
all my attention
on my own advanced

15:48.948 --> 15:50.359
math and science projects?

15:50.575 --> 15:51.815
What a dream come true!

15:52.034 --> 15:54.617
But there aren't any
classrooms with other students.

15:54.829 --> 15:56.786
You'll be doing
everything on your own.

15:56.998 --> 15:59.831
Oh, maybe she has news about
my application to Everton!

16:00.042 --> 16:02.033
I just don't want you
to miss out on anything,

16:02.253 --> 16:03.539
that's all.

16:03.754 --> 16:05.665
Being around other
people isn't a bad thing.

16:05.882 --> 16:08.749
Sometimes it's how you learn
the most about yourself.

16:08.968 --> 16:10.083
I guess.

16:10.303 --> 16:11.668
Meet you in
Principal Cinch's office

16:11.888 --> 16:13.629
in a few minutes?

16:13.848 --> 16:15.759
What's she so worried about?

16:15.975 --> 16:18.842
Everton is exactly
what I need right now.

16:19.061 --> 16:22.270
It's not like I have anything
left to learn at Crystal Prep.

16:24.275 --> 16:28.234

Shining Armor?

19:25.039 --> 19:26.245
Why is my brother here?

19:26.457 --> 19:27.913
As an alumni, Principal Cinch

19:28.125 --> 19:30.913
thought he could provide
some unique perspective.

19:31.754 --> 19:32.710
Perspective on what?

19:32.922 --> 19:35.914
Why, the Friendship
Games, of course.

19:36.133 --> 19:39.876
You competed in the games,
did you not Shining Armor?

19:40.096 --> 19:41.427
I did.

19:41.639 --> 19:44.006
And do you happen
to recall who won?

19:44.225 --> 19:45.761
Crystal Prep did.

19:45.976 --> 19:47.717
We always win.

19:47.937 --> 19:50.019
We always win.

19:50.231 --> 19:51.721
Why did you ask to see me?

19:51.941 --> 19:54.273
Twilight, I'll be honest,

19:54.485 --> 19:58.194
it doesn't matter whether or not
Crystal Prep wins or loses.

19:59.365 --> 20:02.357
The important thing is
that we are expected to win

20:02.576 --> 20:05.944
You competed in the games,
did you not Shining Armor?

20:06.163 --> 20:09.576
And it is that
reputation, my reputation,

20:09.792 --> 20:12.910
that is responsible for
everything we have here,

20:13.129 --> 20:16.247
for everything you've clone here.

20:16.465 --> 20:18.627
And you've done quite
a lot, haven't you?

20:18.843 --> 20:22.381
- I don't know. I guess.
- Oh, don't be modest.

20:22.596 --> 20:25.213
You're the best student
this school as ever seen.

20:25.433 --> 20:28.596
What I can't understand
is why my best student

20:28.811 --> 20:30.768
wouldn't want to compete.

20:30.980 --> 20:32.391
In the Friendship Games?

20:32.606 --> 20:35.189
Look Twighly, I know
it's not really your thing,

20:35.401 --> 20:37.984
but representing the school
is kind of a big deal.

20:38.195 --> 20:39.936
Plus, they could
really use your help.

20:40.156 --> 20:42.648
It seems Canterlot High
is undergoing something

20:42.867 --> 20:45.154
of a renaissance;
test scores are up,

20:45.369 --> 20:48.612
grades, even athletics
are on the rise.

20:48.831 --> 20:50.993
You see, they are
developing somewhat

20:51.208 --> 20:53.745
of a reputation.

20:53.961 --> 20:57.329
This cannot happen.

20:57.548 --> 20:59.630
Principal Cinch, I
can't possible participate

20:59.842 --> 21:01.549
in the games, my
work here is very-

21:01.761 --> 21:03.923
Ah, yes. Your work.

21:04.138 --> 21:06.630
Cadance, could you
and Shining Armor

21:06.849 --> 21:07.839
find my contact sheet for the

21:08.058 --> 21:09.890
Everton Independent
Study Program?

21:10.102 --> 21:11.467
Of course.

21:14.064 --> 21:16.681
I understand you've applied.

21:16.901 --> 21:20.360
You see, one of the advantages
of having a reputation

21:20.571 --> 21:24.360
is a certain amount of
influence in such things.

21:24.575 --> 21:28.990
So, let me offer you a deal.

21:29.205 --> 21:33.449
In return for contributing
your agile mind to these games

21:33.667 --> 21:37.501
I will use my influence to
guarantee your application

21:37.713 --> 21:39.499
is approved.

21:39.715 --> 21:42.878
Though, I suppose I
could also have it

21:43.093 --> 21:45.425
denied.
(foreboding music)

21:45.638 --> 21:48.676
What do you think I should do?

21:57.483 --> 22:00.191
(growling)

22:01.737 --> 22:02.852
Come on, Spike.

22:03.072 --> 22:04.654
Is a certain amount of
influence in such things.

22:04.865 --> 22:06.947
For the Friendship Games.

22:07.159 --> 22:09.776
The only difference now
is that I have to compete.

22:09.995 --> 22:12.612
Besides, it's not like
Principal Cinch gave me

22:12.832 --> 22:15.369
much of a choice.
(whimpering)

22:15.584 --> 22:17.746
I know Spike, I
don't like it either.

22:17.962 --> 22:19.327
I probably won't
be able to collect

22:19.547 --> 22:21.333
anywhere near as much
data as I thought!

22:24.426 --> 22:26.758
But maybe I can still get some.

22:29.306 --> 22:31.263
Spike, I wouldn't
leave without you!

22:31.475 --> 22:32.761
Just remember to be quiet.

22:32.977 --> 22:34.763
And try not to shed.

22:37.481 --> 22:38.721
(door creaks)

22:42.736 --> 22:45.819
Dean Cadance, I'm not
really sure where to go.

22:46.031 --> 22:47.817
One second, Twilight.

22:48.033 --> 22:50.240
You could try
the end of the line.

22:51.620 --> 22:52.781
What did you say?

22:52.997 --> 22:56.115
Just that someone
as smart as you

22:56.333 --> 22:58.665
should definitely go first.

22:58.878 --> 23:02.041
I didn't mean to.
I was just asking.

23:02.256 --> 23:03.542
This is the
right bus, Twilight.

23:03.757 --> 23:04.588
Go ahead.

23:04.800 --> 23:06.666
But I didn't mean
to cut in front...

23:06.886 --> 23:08.672
Yeah, well it's too late now.

23:12.266 --> 23:13.802
Are we gonna win?

23:14.018 --> 23:17.852
- I, I don't know.
- Wrong answer, try again!

23:18.063 --> 23:20.270
Are we gonna win?

23:20.482 --> 23:22.268
Um, I guess?

23:22.484 --> 23:24.145
It's just, I mean,

23:24.361 --> 23:26.352
I heard that CHS
is doing well now.

23:26.572 --> 23:27.687
With their reputation.

23:27.907 --> 23:30.114
And, I mean, it's
not better than ours,

23:30.326 --> 23:31.908
of course, but we
can't let them do it,

23:32.119 --> 23:34.406
you know, win I mean, right?

23:37.666 --> 23:39.623
You're gonna
have to take a seat.

23:47.927 --> 23:50.259
- Hi Sugarcoat.
- That was a really bad speech.

23:50.471 --> 23:52.087
You should consider
not speaking in public.

23:55.809 --> 23:58.517
Well Spike, at least
I've got you with me.

23:58.729 --> 24:01.266
(rock music)

24:01.482 --> 24:04.600
Yo, you have gotta hear this!

24:04.818 --> 24:06.855
(whimpers)

24:10.699 --> 24:13.612
(upbeat music)

24:15.245 --> 24:17.987
I hope the Friendship games
have a music competition,

24:18.207 --> 24:20.619
because we would
totally rock it!

24:20.834 --> 24:22.575
Um, we're supposed
to keep magic

24:22.795 --> 24:24.832
out of the Friendship
Games, remember?

24:25.965 --> 24:27.876
Easier said
than done, darling.

24:28.092 --> 24:30.675
I'm sure in Equestria magic
does whatever you want,

24:30.886 --> 24:33.253
- but...
- This isn't Equestria.

24:33.472 --> 24:36.590
Well when it comes to magic
I'm sure you'll figure it out.

24:36.809 --> 24:38.675
And while Sunset works
on keeping the magic

24:38.894 --> 24:41.261
out of the games,
I've been working on

24:41.480 --> 24:42.891
what to put in.

24:43.107 --> 24:46.065
Rarity, what did you go and do?

24:46.276 --> 24:48.813
Well, I had a little
time on my hands

24:49.029 --> 24:50.144
and since we don't know what the

24:50.364 --> 24:51.820
Friendship Games events are,

24:52.032 --> 24:54.615
I made a few options
for uniforms!

24:54.827 --> 24:56.909
You really didn't
have to do that.

24:57.121 --> 24:58.202
I know.

24:58.414 --> 25:01.281
No, you really
didn't have to.

25:01.500 --> 25:02.831
I know! (giggles)

25:06.171 --> 25:07.627
Vice Principal Luna
can help your students

25:07.840 --> 25:09.672
get settled if you'd like
me to show you around,

25:09.883 --> 25:11.373
Principal Cinch.

25:11.593 --> 25:13.630
There have been quite a few
changes since your last visit.

25:13.846 --> 25:16.713
Oh yes, Principal Celestia.

25:16.932 --> 25:19.219
I'm sure that would
be fascinating.

25:20.936 --> 25:24.054
Oh, it's always such a pleasure to
see you, Dean Cadance.

25:24.273 --> 25:26.731
Even if it means another defeat.

25:26.942 --> 25:28.478
Thank you, Vice
Principal Luna.

25:28.694 --> 25:31.652
But I hear it's not going
to be so easy this time.

25:35.784 --> 25:37.570
Coming through!

25:39.872 --> 25:43.786
- Seriously?
- Oh sorry, I didn't mean to.

25:46.795 --> 25:48.081
Oh, sorry.

25:48.297 --> 25:49.833
Why don't you go ahead?

25:50.049 --> 25:53.292
You are such a sweetie!

25:53.510 --> 25:55.126
I am watching you.

25:58.766 --> 26:00.757
Ah, yeah!

26:00.976 --> 26:01.681
(grunts)

26:01.894 --> 26:04.682
(screams)

26:04.897 --> 26:06.558
You are kind of being
a doormat right now.

26:11.695 --> 26:13.606
(suspenseful music)

26:19.661 --> 26:20.867
Hi, Twilight.

26:24.249 --> 26:25.990
Hey, Twilight!

26:29.338 --> 26:31.170
- Hi, Twilight.
- Hi, Twilight.

26:31.381 --> 26:32.871
Hey, you, looking good!

26:33.092 --> 26:34.048
"M, hi!

26:34.259 --> 26:35.249
Hey, what's happening?

26:35.469 --> 26:36.709
Really nice to see you.

26:36.929 --> 26:37.669
Twilight, how you doing?

26:37.888 --> 26:39.470
Twilight, yeah!

26:39.681 --> 26:40.671
Hey, hello.

26:40.891 --> 26:42.222
Uh, good.
(thuds)

26:43.894 --> 26:46.306
Twilight? I almost didn't
recognize you.

26:49.024 --> 26:51.015
When did you start
wearing glasses?

26:51.235 --> 26:53.567
Um, like since forever.

26:53.779 --> 26:55.736
Oh, so how long
are you here for?

26:55.948 --> 26:57.404
Just for the
Friendship Games.

26:57.616 --> 27:00.779
Right, of course!
We'll totally win with you here.

27:05.833 --> 27:06.994
Uh...

27:07.209 --> 27:08.040
I Qotta go.

27:08.252 --> 27:10.163
Uh, okay, bye?

27:16.552 --> 27:17.337
Uh, Rarity,

27:17.553 --> 27:18.918
these outfits are great, but

27:19.138 --> 27:20.720
why would you put so
much time and effort

27:20.931 --> 27:22.717
into clothes we
might not even wear?

27:22.933 --> 27:25.516
You're gonna exhaust yourself
before the games even start!

27:25.727 --> 27:26.762
Oh! (scoffs)

27:26.979 --> 27:28.640
Don't be silly, darling.

27:28.856 --> 27:31.268
Putting effort into
clothes is what I live for!

27:31.483 --> 27:32.973
And spending time on my friends

27:33.193 --> 27:35.776
fills me with energy!

27:41.034 --> 27:43.321
(gasping)

27:43.537 --> 27:45.403
And magic, too, I guess.

27:49.668 --> 27:52.706
(suspenseful music)

28:02.723 --> 28:04.760
Actually Applejack,

28:04.975 --> 28:06.636
now that you mention it...

28:06.852 --> 28:09.640
I suppose I could
use a tiny break.

28:09.855 --> 28:11.641
I told you!

28:14.067 --> 28:15.478
Twilight?

28:15.694 --> 28:17.480
Uh, yes?

28:17.696 --> 28:18.606
Well I'll be!

28:18.822 --> 28:21.109
You should've told
us you were coming!

28:21.325 --> 28:23.362
Darling, those glasses!

28:23.577 --> 28:24.908
What're you wearing?

28:25.120 --> 28:26.610
It's so severe.

28:26.830 --> 28:28.912
My uniform.

28:29.082 --> 28:31.289
Your uniform for what?

28:31.501 --> 28:33.367
For Crystal Prep.

28:33.587 --> 28:35.919
But why does everyone at
this school know who I am?

28:36.131 --> 28:38.668
Did you just
say Crystal Prep?

28:38.884 --> 28:40.045
(barking)

28:40.260 --> 28:41.500
Spike!

28:41.720 --> 28:43.631
You know my dog's name too?

28:44.848 --> 28:48.967
And our music program
has especially taken off.

28:49.186 --> 28:49.971
Twilight?

28:50.187 --> 28:51.894
This is getting ridiculous.

28:52.105 --> 28:55.643
I must apologize for the
curiosity of my prize student.

28:55.859 --> 28:57.145
Your student?

28:57.361 --> 28:59.728
The smart ones
are always curious.

28:59.947 --> 29:03.281
I'll return her to check in
with the rest of her classmates.

29:05.786 --> 29:08.244
I didn't know Twilight
had a twin sister!

29:08.455 --> 29:09.661
She doesn't!

29:09.873 --> 29:10.908
That Twilight is obviously
the Twilight from

29:11.083 --> 29:12.573
this world, since it
couldn't possible be

29:12.793 --> 29:13.908
the Twilight from the pony
world, since the Twilight

29:14.127 --> 29:14.958
from the pony world
doesn't go to Crystal Prep

29:15.170 --> 29:16.376
or wear glasses!

29:17.798 --> 29:19.038
Nevermind.

29:20.968 --> 29:22.709
I'm sorry Principal Cinch.

29:22.928 --> 29:24.635
I was just following
these strange readings.

29:24.846 --> 29:26.883
Actually, they led me
to those girls, and-

29:27.099 --> 29:29.386
Twilight, what you
do in your free time

29:29.601 --> 29:31.808
is of little interest to
me, but while you're here

29:32.020 --> 29:35.638
I, all of Crystal Prep in fact,
require your complete focus.

29:39.444 --> 29:41.856
But why does everyone at
this school seem to know me?

29:42.072 --> 29:43.733
Perhaps they're
trying to confuse you.

29:43.949 --> 29:46.361
Perhaps they're trying
to lure you away.

29:46.576 --> 29:49.113
It didn't feel like
anyone was trying to lure me.

29:49.329 --> 29:50.865
I don't know what
they're playing at,

29:51.081 --> 29:53.618
but I guarantee it
isn't to help us win.

29:56.378 --> 29:58.369
Actually, they led me
to those girls, and-

29:58.588 --> 30:00.329
goes to Crystal Prep!

30:00.549 --> 30:03.291
You're saying that Twilight's
gonna play against us?

30:03.510 --> 30:04.625
She'd never do that.

30:04.845 --> 30:06.631
Our Twilight wouldn't.

30:06.847 --> 30:09.009
Our Twilight is a
princess in Equestria,

30:09.224 --> 30:11.010
and an expert in
friendship magic.

30:11.226 --> 30:13.433
And if she was here we'd
have already figured out

30:13.645 --> 30:15.261
why magic is randomly
popping up during

30:15.480 --> 30:17.266
pep rallies and costume changes!

30:21.445 --> 30:22.230
(sighs)

30:22.446 --> 30:23.652
Sorry.

30:23.864 --> 30:25.650
I'm just frustrated that I
haven't heard back from her.

30:25.866 --> 30:27.823
She's a princess
in Equestria!

30:28.035 --> 30:29.992
Probably got problems
of her own to deal with.

30:30.203 --> 30:31.693
We certainly can't
expect her to drop

30:31.913 --> 30:34.200
everything and pop through
the portal whenever.

30:34.416 --> 30:36.657
Especially if it's to deal
with something as minor

30:36.877 --> 30:38.618
why magic is randomly
popping up during

30:38.837 --> 30:40.669
But they aren't minor!

30:40.881 --> 30:42.747
Magic came into this
world when I stole

30:42.966 --> 30:44.127
Twilight's crown.

30:44.343 --> 30:47.426
It's taken a lot for me
to earn everyone's trust.

30:47.637 --> 30:49.298
If we have to forfeit
the games because I can't

30:49.514 --> 30:51.676
think of a way to keep
it under control...

30:51.892 --> 30:52.802
Oh Sunset,

30:53.018 --> 30:55.180
I'm sure you'll be able
to figure things out.

30:55.395 --> 30:56.851
You're the one who
helped us understand

30:57.064 --> 30:59.101
what was going on with
the Sirens, remember?

30:59.316 --> 31:01.478
I guess, but
Twilight was the one

31:01.693 --> 31:03.730
who really figured out what
we needed to defeat them.

31:03.945 --> 31:05.777
Don't you remember darling?

31:05.989 --> 31:08.572
What we needed to
defeat them was you.

31:10.118 --> 31:10.949
Alright.

31:11.161 --> 31:12.777
(cheering)

31:12.996 --> 31:14.737
Come on guys, let's
see if we can find

31:14.956 --> 31:17.618
any info about the events
and come up with a strategy!

31:18.877 --> 31:20.288
You coming, Sunset?

31:20.504 --> 31:22.711
I'll catch up with
you guys in a bit.

31:29.012 --> 31:30.298
(soft music)

31:30.514 --> 31:31.800
Still no reply.

31:38.980 --> 31:41.642
(suspenseful music)

31:44.236 --> 31:46.068
Maybe there's another
way I could reach her.

31:47.114 --> 31:49.446
L-ley, let g0!

31:52.244 --> 31:53.450
(lap)
(screaming)

31:56.873 --> 31:58.659
What did you do?

31:58.875 --> 32:01.617
Twilight, you have to
check in with the others.

32:05.799 --> 32:07.631
(intense music)

32:07.843 --> 32:09.754
Where's the portal?

32:09.970 --> 32:11.460
Where's the portal?

32:14.141 --> 32:17.054
(upbeat music)

32:21.690 --> 32:23.977
(crack, thuds)

32:26.069 --> 32:27.855
What do you mean
the portal's gone?

32:28.071 --> 32:29.653
I mean it's gone.

32:29.865 --> 32:32.573
It's closed, it's
not there anymore.

32:33.160 --> 32:34.742
How'd that happen?

32:35.328 --> 32:38.195
I don't know, but
it has something to do

32:38.415 --> 32:39.746
with that Twilight.

32:41.835 --> 32:43.792
What in tarnation
is she up to?

32:46.465 --> 32:47.921
Leave this to me.

32:50.135 --> 32:52.672
Twilight, what have
you been up to?

32:52.888 --> 32:53.628
Me?

32:53.847 --> 32:55.212
Oh, I was just-

32:55.432 --> 32:56.297
Who wants to know?

32:56.516 --> 32:57.722
Um, we do!

32:57.934 --> 33:00.642
Alright everyone,
let's not get too competitive

33:00.854 --> 33:02.436
before the games even start!

33:02.647 --> 33:04.183
The games aren't
really competitive

33:04.399 --> 33:05.639
since we've never lost.

33:05.859 --> 33:07.441
That's not a very
nice thing to say.

33:07.652 --> 33:10.610
Sorry dearie, but these
games aren't about being nice.

33:10.822 --> 33:13.234
Well you might
use a little tact.

33:15.076 --> 33:16.658
Hi! I'm Pinkie Pie!

33:16.870 --> 33:18.110
Oh, hi.

33:18.330 --> 33:19.161
I'm Twilight.

33:19.372 --> 33:20.908
(rattling)
I know!

33:21.124 --> 33:22.364
You look just like my friend.

33:22.584 --> 33:23.665
Her name is Twilight, too.

33:23.877 --> 33:25.743
Since we've never lost.

33:25.962 --> 33:27.293
What's that?

33:27.506 --> 33:28.712
It's sort of a spectrometer.

33:28.924 --> 33:30.881
I built it to track
EM frequencies.

33:31.092 --> 33:32.753
But it can also
contain anomalies.

33:34.888 --> 33:37.425
- It measures things.
- Like the party?

33:37.641 --> 33:40.804
Yeah, though it doesn't look
like much of a party to me.

33:41.019 --> 33:44.137
I know!
Something is definitely missing.

33:44.940 --> 33:46.055
Come on!

33:46.691 --> 33:47.977
Hello everyone!

33:48.193 --> 33:50.025
I'd like to take
this opportunity

33:50.237 --> 33:52.945
to greet all of our visitors
from Crystal Prep Academy

33:53.156 --> 33:55.193
and welcome them to CHS.

33:55.408 --> 33:57.775
(grunting)
What in the world

33:57.994 --> 33:58.984
is in these?

33:59.204 --> 34:00.945
Party cannons, of course!

34:01.164 --> 34:03.496
And lastly I would
like to recognize

34:03.708 --> 34:07.576
the 12 students that CHS
has elected to compete.

34:07.796 --> 34:09.581
I don't think we could've
chosen a better group

34:09.797 --> 34:11.914
to represent the
excellence, sportsmanship,

34:12.132 --> 34:14.750
and friendship the
games stand for.

34:23.895 --> 34:26.728
(dance music)

34:29.734 --> 34:31.190
(chatter, laughter)

34:31.402 --> 34:34.020
Um, are you sure
this is a good idea?

34:34.239 --> 34:36.025
Absolutely!

34:54.342 --> 34:56.458
(squeals)
Ooh, floaty!

35:03.768 --> 35:05.850
Aw...

35:06.062 --> 35:07.518
(groans)

35:07.731 --> 35:10.314
I am party POOPED-

35:29.586 --> 35:31.418
(mic feedback)

35:34.799 --> 35:36.585
I'd like to thank
Principal Celestia

35:36.801 --> 35:38.712
for her unconventional welcome.

35:38.928 --> 35:41.135
It's been four years since
the last Friendship Games,

35:41.348 --> 35:43.715
but it feels as though
nothing has changed.

35:43.933 --> 35:47.096
Canterlot High continues
to pick its competitors

35:47.312 --> 35:51.226
in a popularity contest,
and Crystal Prep continues

35:51.441 --> 35:53.773
to field its top 12 students.

35:53.985 --> 35:57.194
It is a comfort to know that
even after so many years

35:57.405 --> 36:02.195
of losses, your school remains
committed to its ideals,

36:02.535 --> 36:05.618
however misguided they may be.

36:05.830 --> 36:08.447
I wish you all the best of luck,

36:08.667 --> 36:11.785
regardless of the
inevitable outcome.

36:15.757 --> 36:16.872
I'm sorry Pinkie.

36:17.092 --> 36:19.709
I thought your party
additions were really swell!

36:19.928 --> 36:21.544
They definitely
broke the ice.

36:21.763 --> 36:23.845
Yes, if only that
Principal Cinch hadn't

36:24.057 --> 36:25.343
frozen it again.

36:25.558 --> 36:27.765
Yeah. She's awful.

36:27.977 --> 36:29.308
Wow Pinkie, what
happened to you?

36:29.521 --> 36:30.727
I don't know.

36:30.939 --> 36:32.725
Everyone started having
fun after Twilight and I

36:32.941 --> 36:35.399
fired the party cannons,
and I ponied up.

36:35.610 --> 36:36.771
Of course you did.

36:36.986 --> 36:39.728
But then the magic just
drained right out of me.

36:39.948 --> 36:43.157
Wait, what do you
mean drained out of you?

36:43.368 --> 36:45.575
Hey, where is
that other Twilight?

36:45.787 --> 36:47.744
Oh, she's right...

36:47.956 --> 36:50.789
Uh, well she was right here.

36:57.132 --> 36:58.588
Good morning students.

36:58.800 --> 37:01.132
I'm sure you're all thrilled
to start the first clay

37:01.344 --> 37:02.584
of the Friendship Games.

37:02.804 --> 37:05.512
Our competitors will
face off in every aspect

37:05.724 --> 37:07.965
of the CHS curriculum,
culminating in the

37:08.184 --> 37:10.300
elimination equation finale.

37:10.520 --> 37:12.602
Welcome to the first event:

37:12.814 --> 37:14.270
the academic decathlon!

37:14.482 --> 37:16.189
You'll be scored on
chemistry, home-ec,

37:16.401 --> 37:17.607
and everything in between.

37:17.819 --> 37:20.402
But remember, only
the six students

37:20.613 --> 37:22.195
from each team with
the most points

37:22.407 --> 37:24.193
will move on to
event number two.

37:24.409 --> 37:25.524
Good luck!

(shutter clicks)

40:10.700 --> 40:13.032
That means the winner
of the Friendship Games

40:13.244 --> 40:17.203
first even is Twilight
Sparkle and Crystal Prep!

40:20.752 --> 40:24.245
- That was awesome!
- Truly amazing.

40:24.464 --> 40:25.625
But we didn't win!

40:25.840 --> 40:28.798
That was as close to winning
as Canterlot's ever been.

40:29.010 --> 40:31.047
After a careful
tally of the points,

40:31.262 --> 40:33.219
we'd like to present
the students moving on

40:33.431 --> 40:35.297
to the Friendship
Games second event.

40:35.516 --> 40:37.473
(applause)

40:37.685 --> 40:40.768
(cheering)

40:45.902 --> 40:47.358
Congratulations.

40:47.570 --> 40:48.776
You were really great.

40:48.988 --> 40:50.820
I'm sorry, excuse me.

40:51.032 --> 40:52.773
Okay then.
(groans)

40:58.831 --> 41:01.698
(mysterious music)

41:08.007 --> 41:10.715
Do you want to
give her a treat?

41:13.179 --> 41:14.465
Guess I'm not the only one

41:14.681 --> 41:16.763
to smuggle her pet into school.

41:16.975 --> 41:19.137
(giggles)
Not just one.

41:20.812 --> 41:23.770
Oh, wow.
All I have is Spike.

41:24.899 --> 41:26.435
It really is uncanny.

41:26.651 --> 41:27.607
Does he talk?

41:27.819 --> 41:30.777
Um, not that I know of.

41:30.989 --> 41:32.775
Congratulations on
winning, by the way.

41:32.991 --> 41:35.574
Though it didn't seem
like anyone on your team

41:35.785 --> 41:37.196
was very excited about it.

41:37.412 --> 41:38.868
No one at my school
gets excited about

41:39.080 --> 41:41.412
anything they didn't
do themselves.

41:41.624 --> 41:43.535
That sounds awful.

41:47.839 --> 41:49.250
Here.

41:49.465 --> 41:51.752
Hold this!

41:51.968 --> 41:53.709
Um, why?

41:53.928 --> 41:56.590
Holding a bunny always
makes me feel better.

41:56.806 --> 41:58.672
Well that's ridiculous.

41:58.891 --> 41:59.847
But...

42:00.059 --> 42:03.472
Oh, it actually kind of works.

42:04.313 --> 42:06.850
I'm on the other team
and you just lost.

42:07.066 --> 42:08.648
Why are you being so nice to me?

42:08.860 --> 42:10.646
You look like you needed it.

42:10.862 --> 42:13.775
(majestic music)

42:15.658 --> 42:16.489
(gasps)

42:16.701 --> 42:19.068
Wow!

42:19.287 --> 42:23.622
(suspenseful music)

42:29.547 --> 42:31.083
Spike!
(barkms)

42:32.508 --> 42:33.748
(whimpers)

42:34.844 --> 42:35.754
Spike!

42:39.724 --> 42:41.806
Spike, are you okay?

42:42.018 --> 42:43.600
Um, I think so.

42:45.063 --> 42:46.770
(screams)

42:46.981 --> 42:48.813
Twilight, wait!

42:49.025 --> 42:50.140
(whimpers)

42:50.359 --> 42:51.520
Bye.

42:52.445 --> 42:53.981
(panting)

42:54.197 --> 42:55.653
Twilight, come on!

42:55.865 --> 42:57.151
Wait for me!

42:59.786 --> 43:01.652
Why did you run away like that?

43:02.663 --> 43:04.324
Um, oh, I don't know.

43:04.540 --> 43:06.372
Maybe it has something to
do with the glowing girl,

43:06.584 --> 43:09.372
or the hole in space,
or my talking dog!

43:09.587 --> 43:10.873
Yeah, weird right?

43:13.382 --> 43:14.247
Are you okay?

43:14.467 --> 43:15.423
How do you feel?

43:15.635 --> 43:16.215
What happened?

43:16.427 --> 43:17.667
Where did you go?

43:17.887 --> 43:19.673
Hey, one question at a time!

43:19.889 --> 43:21.095
This is pretty new to me too.

43:21.307 --> 43:22.593
Sorry.

43:22.809 --> 43:24.675
All I know is I
chased that pointy rabbit

43:24.894 --> 43:27.056
through the glowy thing, and
then I was somewhere else.

43:27.271 --> 43:29.854
Next thing I knew I was back
in that nice girl's arms

43:30.066 --> 43:31.522
and I could talk!

43:31.734 --> 43:33.441
I don't really understand
why I couldn't before.

43:33.653 --> 43:35.189
I mean, it's so easy.

43:35.404 --> 43:36.644
Twilight...

43:38.116 --> 43:40.232
Quick, hide in here!

43:40.451 --> 43:41.566
Who are you talking to?

43:41.786 --> 43:43.276
Um, myself.

43:43.496 --> 43:44.986
It's a nervous habit.

43:45.206 --> 43:46.696
Were you looking for me?

43:46.916 --> 43:47.826
Indeed I was.

43:48.042 --> 43:50.534
Quite a coincidence
that the CHS students

43:50.753 --> 43:52.869
moving on to the next
event are the same nice

43:53.089 --> 43:55.296
girls who were so
interested in you.

43:55.508 --> 43:56.714
Don't you think?

43:56.926 --> 43:58.087
I'm not sure.

43:58.302 --> 44:00.543
Perhaps you should get
to know them after all.

44:00.763 --> 44:02.629
Um, myself.

44:02.849 --> 44:05.511
Let's just say I'm
covering my bases.

44:05.726 --> 44:07.967
Who knows, perhaps
they will reveal to you

44:08.187 --> 44:10.895
the secret to Canterlot
High's newfound success.

44:11.107 --> 44:12.097
I don't know.

44:12.316 --> 44:14.603
Spying feels kind of wrong.

44:16.571 --> 44:18.812
Well, it's your
decision, Twilight.

44:19.031 --> 44:22.444
It's not as if your application
hangs in the balance.

44:22.660 --> 44:25.652
On second thought,
yes it does.

44:27.373 --> 44:30.741
Man, she's awful.
What're you gonna do?

44:30.960 --> 44:33.497
I don't know, Spike.

44:33.713 --> 44:34.828
I don't know.

44:38.384 --> 44:40.546
All I did was hand
Twilight a bunny,

44:40.761 --> 44:42.627
then I ponied up.

44:42.847 --> 44:44.008
I just don't get it.

44:44.223 --> 44:46.635
Rarity's magic came out
when she made us outfits,

44:46.851 --> 44:49.593
Pinkie's when she fixed the
party, and now Fluttershy.

44:49.812 --> 44:52.429
And then Twilight's
pendant thingy just pulled

44:52.648 --> 44:53.979
the magic right out of me!

44:54.192 --> 44:55.978
I couldn't even stand up.

44:56.194 --> 44:57.650
Like me at the party.

44:57.862 --> 44:59.648
Or me right before
we met Twilight.

44:59.864 --> 45:01.605
So she's stealing magic?

45:01.824 --> 45:02.939
I don't know.

45:03.159 --> 45:05.400
She doesn't seem like
the magic stealing type.

45:05.620 --> 45:07.076
Yeah, but she
had something to do

45:07.288 --> 45:08.528
with closing the portal!

45:08.748 --> 45:10.659
If her pendant can pull in magic

45:10.875 --> 45:12.832
maybe it stole the portal too!

45:13.044 --> 45:15.376
- How?
- I don't know.

45:15.588 --> 45:17.750
And the pony, or person, or
princess who could help me

45:17.965 --> 45:21.083
figure this out is
completely unreachable now.

45:21.302 --> 45:23.134
Which is too bad, because
Twilight knows everything

45:23.346 --> 45:25.508
about magic, and portals,
and magical portals,

45:25.723 --> 45:27.589
and portable magics!

45:27.808 --> 45:29.014
(thuds)

45:29.227 --> 45:32.015
with closing the portal!

45:32.230 --> 45:35.768
And as long as this event
puts me in a playing field,

45:35.983 --> 45:38.645
I don't think we've got
anything to worry about.

45:38.861 --> 45:41.728
Oh, it puts you on a
playing field alright.

45:41.948 --> 45:43.063
(screams)

45:43.282 --> 45:47.742
(dramatic music)

45:49.205 --> 45:51.492
Am I the only one who
thinks this is overkill?

45:53.042 --> 45:55.500
I don't suppose you
made motocross outfits?

45:55.711 --> 45:57.952
Oh, don't be ridiculous.

45:58.172 --> 46:00.914
Of course I did!

46:01.133 --> 46:02.589
You will race in pairs.

46:02.802 --> 46:05.510
Indigo Zap, and Sugarcoat
will handle the motocross.

46:05.721 --> 46:06.586
Yes!

46:06.806 --> 46:07.796
Lemon Zest and Sunny
Flare have requested

46:08.015 --> 46:09.426
the short track.

46:09.642 --> 46:11.974
Since archery is a standard
requirement at our school

46:12.186 --> 46:13.802
any of you should
be able to do it.

46:14.021 --> 46:16.183
I don't suppose you
made motocross outfits?

46:16.399 --> 46:18.811
Well that's just marvelous.

46:19.026 --> 46:20.937
If you want to lose
before we even start.

46:21.153 --> 46:24.441
Given that Twilight won
the last event singlehandedly

46:24.657 --> 46:26.443
I have every confidence
that she will be able

46:26.659 --> 46:27.945
to pull her weight here.

46:28.160 --> 46:29.742
Won't you?

46:31.539 --> 46:34.497
(dramatic music, cheering)

46:34.709 --> 46:35.665
(shutter clicks)

46:41.841 --> 46:43.673
Welcome everyone to
the Friendship Games

46:43.884 --> 46:45.670
tri-cross relay!

46:45.886 --> 46:47.468
(cheering)

46:47.680 --> 46:49.591
In this event our
qualifying competitors

46:49.807 --> 46:54.176
will face off in
archery, speed skating,

46:54.395 --> 46:56.762
and finally motocross.

46:56.981 --> 46:58.437
(engines rev)

46:58.649 --> 47:01.482
So if the competitors
are ready...

47:01.694 --> 47:04.482
(foghorn blows loudly)

47:04.697 --> 47:06.608
Each competitor
must hit a bullseye

47:06.824 --> 47:09.737
before their teammates can
start the next leg of the relay.

47:12.830 --> 47:13.661
<i>(thud)!</i>

47:13.873 --> 47:15.830
(cheering)

47:31.474 --> 47:34.683
(dramatic music)

47:36.562 --> 47:38.849
(cheering)

48:06.175 --> 48:08.587
And Canterlot is off
to an early lead!

48:17.520 --> 48:20.888
Well that's just fantastic!

48:22.149 --> 48:24.607
I'm sure glad I don't
go to Crystal Prep.

48:24.819 --> 48:26.059
You said it.

48:29.865 --> 48:31.606
If CPA can't hit
another bullseye soon

48:31.826 --> 48:33.658
they'll be out of this race!

48:37.832 --> 48:40.290
You're really bad at this.

48:40.501 --> 48:42.833
I can't take anymore!

48:43.045 --> 48:44.877
You have to stop
aiming at the target.

48:45.089 --> 48:46.796
Oh, that makes perfect sense.

48:47.007 --> 48:48.213
Don't aim at the target.

48:48.426 --> 48:50.133
Thanks so much.

48:50.344 --> 48:52.802
You have to stop aiming
at where the target is

48:53.013 --> 48:55.471
and aim at where the
target's gonna be.

48:55.683 --> 48:58.471
Yeah, definitely take
advice from the person

48:58.686 --> 48:59.892
you're competing against!

49:00.980 --> 49:02.687
Do you want to hit
the bullseye or not?

49:04.358 --> 49:05.814
Then trust me.

49:06.026 --> 49:07.357
Take a deep breath...

49:09.447 --> 49:12.815
And let the arrow go right...

49:14.827 --> 49:16.317
Don't aim at the target.

49:19.665 --> 49:20.370
(thud)

49:20.583 --> 49:23.041
(cheering)

49:23.252 --> 49:24.959
Yeah, that's my girl!

49:31.802 --> 49:32.587
See?

49:32.803 --> 49:34.089
I was telling you the truth.

49:34.305 --> 49:37.218
(majestic music)

49:43.189 --> 49:46.648
What are you doing?

49:46.859 --> 49:48.190
I don't know!

49:49.820 --> 49:51.106
(zapPin9)

49:58.787 --> 50:01.779
(suspenseful music)

50:03.959 --> 50:05.165
Canterlot only has

50:05.377 --> 50:07.118
two laps to go, but it
looks like Crystal Prep

50:07.338 --> 50:08.624
is making up for lost time!

50:14.011 --> 50:16.673
(cheering)

50:30.778 --> 50:32.109
Come on!

50:38.202 --> 50:39.567
What a finish!

50:40.871 --> 50:42.782
(engines rev)

50:50.005 --> 50:51.712
(screams)

50:52.508 --> 50:54.169
AWESOME!

51:08.524 --> 51:09.685
(growling)

51:11.068 --> 51:12.650
(crowd gasping)

51:34.091 --> 51:34.922
Dash!

51:35.134 --> 51:36.545
You saved me!

51:36.760 --> 51:39.047
I wasn't about to let my
friend become plant food!

51:49.273 --> 51:50.434
We can still win this!

51:54.695 --> 51:57.483
(suspenseful music)

51:59.241 --> 52:01.198
(growling)

52:15.674 --> 52:19.258
(dramatic music)

52:20.721 --> 52:22.052
Canterlot wins!

52:22.264 --> 52:24.881
(cheering)

52:26.727 --> 52:28.309
Attention students.

52:28.520 --> 52:30.261
Please proceed to the gym.

52:33.108 --> 52:35.566
(zapPin9)

52:41.992 --> 52:43.608
Is everybody alright?

52:43.827 --> 52:45.283
Better than alright!

52:45.496 --> 52:46.702
We won!

52:47.790 --> 52:49.701
Yeah, we won, but
somebody could've been

52:49.917 --> 52:51.203
seriously hurt!

52:51.418 --> 52:54.160
The magic is going
haywire and I have no idea

52:54.380 --> 52:55.586
how to fix it!

52:55.798 --> 52:57.334
Um, excuse me.

52:57.549 --> 52:59.085
I didn't mean for any
of this to happen.

52:59.301 --> 53:01.713
I just wanted to learn
about the strange energy

53:01.929 --> 53:03.044
coming from your school.

53:03.263 --> 53:06.130
I didn't know that it was magic
or how it works!

53:06.350 --> 53:08.387
That's okay.
Neither do we.

53:08.602 --> 53:11.060
Oh no!
No, no, no, not again!

53:11.271 --> 53:13.558
(groans)

53:15.776 --> 53:16.857
I'm sorry!

53:17.069 --> 53:18.559
It just started absorbing
energy on its own!

53:18.779 --> 53:20.235
But I'm not sure how!

53:20.447 --> 53:22.609
What do you mean
you don't know how?

53:22.825 --> 53:24.190
(loud zap)

53:24.410 --> 53:27.448
(ominous music)

53:29.665 --> 53:31.702
It also causes these
corresponding rips to appear.

53:31.917 --> 53:33.783
I don't know how
that works either!

53:34.002 --> 53:35.288
Is there anything
you do know?

53:35.504 --> 53:36.915
Like how to get our magic back,

53:37.131 --> 53:39.463
or how to fix the
portal to Equestria?

53:39.675 --> 53:40.585
Equestria?

53:40.801 --> 53:42.758
You're supposed
to be so smart,

53:42.970 --> 53:44.131
but did you ever think
that you shouldn't be

53:44.346 --> 53:46.303
messing around with things
you don't understand?

53:48.142 --> 53:49.803
But I want to understand!

53:50.018 --> 53:51.429
But you don't!

53:51.645 --> 53:53.807
And worst of all, you put
the lives of my friends

53:54.022 --> 53:55.262
in danger!

53:55.482 --> 53:57.769
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to.

53:57.985 --> 53:59.066
(whimpering)

53:59.278 --> 54:01.064
Twilight! Wait!

54:06.452 --> 54:07.738
(clears throat)

54:08.620 --> 54:11.533
You can't possibly
call that a fair race.

54:11.749 --> 54:14.832
Principal Cinch, we
all saw what happened.

54:15.043 --> 54:17.705
You can't think CHS had
some kind of advantage?

54:17.921 --> 54:18.786
Can't I?

54:19.006 --> 54:21.714
Even without your
trained attack plants

54:21.925 --> 54:23.666
your students have wings!

54:23.886 --> 54:25.672
Well the race
certainly had some

54:25.888 --> 54:28.801
extenuating circumstances.

54:29.016 --> 54:30.677
Perhaps we should
end the games now

54:30.893 --> 54:31.849
and declare a tie.

54:32.060 --> 54:33.050
A tie?

54:33.270 --> 54:34.726
Was this your
strategy all along?

54:34.938 --> 54:37.350
To force us into
accepting you as equals?

54:37.566 --> 54:38.806
I think not!

54:39.026 --> 54:40.812
The games will continue,
and Crystal Prep

54:41.028 --> 54:42.644
will prevail despite
your antics and whatever

54:42.863 --> 54:45.195
performance enhancing
regimen your students are on!

54:47.201 --> 54:49.693
I'm sorry I couldn't stop
all this from happening.

54:49.912 --> 54:51.949
It's not your fault, Sunset.

54:52.164 --> 54:53.620
Isn't it?

54:53.832 --> 54:56.540
I should know how to control
the magic I brought here.

54:56.752 --> 54:57.833
But I don't.

54:58.045 --> 54:59.251
I let everyone down.

54:59.463 --> 55:01.625
And now Principal Cinch
thinks we're cheating!

55:01.840 --> 55:04.502
It doesn't matter what
Principal Cinch thinks.

55:04.718 --> 55:05.674
But it does.

55:05.886 --> 55:08.423
The students here at CHS
don't just want to win.

55:08.639 --> 55:09.879
They want to beat Crystal Prep!

55:10.098 --> 55:11.759
It isn't gonna count
if the other side

55:11.975 --> 55:13.511
doesn't really think they lost.

55:13.727 --> 55:15.468
Crystal Prep is
never gonna believe

55:15.687 --> 55:17.473
we won fair and square
if there's magic around.

55:17.689 --> 55:20.101
And that magic is only around

55:20.317 --> 55:21.728
because of me.

55:25.697 --> 55:28.405
(soft music, cheering)

55:28.617 --> 55:30.483
Since the score is tied,

55:30.702 --> 55:32.192
the final event will
determine the winner

55:32.412 --> 55:33.948
of the Friendship Games.

55:34.164 --> 55:36.201
Somewhere on campus a
pennant from each school

55:36.416 --> 55:37.577
has been hidden.

55:37.793 --> 55:39.329
The first team to find
their school's flag

55:39.545 --> 55:40.831
and bring it back wins.

55:41.046 --> 55:42.332
And as soon as
our teams are ready

55:42.548 --> 55:43.583
we'll begin.

55:43.799 --> 55:47.087
I don't feel like
playing these games anymore.

55:47.302 --> 55:48.713
But we have to play!

55:48.929 --> 55:50.761
This is the last event!

55:50.973 --> 55:52.259
It's a little hard
to focus with all the

55:52.474 --> 55:54.715
magic stealing and
portal opening.

55:54.935 --> 55:57.518
And I feel awful about
what I said to Twilight.

55:57.729 --> 56:00.061
Especially since she
obviously didn't mean

56:00.274 --> 56:01.810
to do all the stuff she did.

56:02.025 --> 56:03.686
She's actually really nice.

56:09.032 --> 56:10.739
Let's just get
through this last event

56:10.951 --> 56:12.191
and prove we're not
a bunch of cheaters.

56:12.411 --> 56:14.402
Then you can go
over and apologize.

56:15.831 --> 56:17.822
I know I'm asking you
to beat a team that isn't

56:18.041 --> 56:20.908
playing fair, but Canterlot
High must be made to understand

56:21.128 --> 56:22.618
that even with magic
at their disposal

56:22.838 --> 56:25.751
beating Crystal Prep is
simply not an option.

56:25.966 --> 56:27.456
What if they
grow wings again?

56:27.676 --> 56:29.713
A fair question, though
I believe we can now

56:29.928 --> 56:31.589
fight fire with fire.

56:32.681 --> 56:35.218
I've seen what your
device can do, Twilight.

56:35.434 --> 56:37.596
Containing magical
energy is fine,

56:37.811 --> 56:40.599
but have you considered
releasing it?

56:40.814 --> 56:43.226
But I don't even
understand how it works.

56:43.442 --> 56:45.774
But you'd like to,
and since our opponents

56:45.986 --> 56:47.818
have already used it
to stay competitive

56:48.030 --> 56:49.816
I see no reason why we
shouldn't do the same.

56:50.032 --> 56:53.241
Unless of course you
have no interest in Everton.

56:53.452 --> 56:56.410
Though honestly, I think
there's more knowledge

56:56.622 --> 56:58.784
packed in that little device

56:58.999 --> 57:02.708
than any independent
study program could offer.

games depends on me

♪ And what doors might open

01:00:56.903 --> 01:00:58.485
You were right.

01:00:58.697 --> 01:01:00.654
I didn't understand
magic before.

01:01:00.866 --> 01:01:02.732
But I do now!

01:01:05.912 --> 01:01:07.573
(explosion)

01:01:08.832 --> 01:01:10.163
Equestria!

01:01:33.523 --> 01:01:35.389
Hey, where are you going?

01:01:35.609 --> 01:01:38.727
Anywhere to
avoid that monster!

01:01:38.945 --> 01:01:41.152
And I suggest you do the same.

01:01:44.284 --> 01:01:46.776
Twilight, you can't do this.

01:01:46.995 --> 01:01:47.985
Why not?

01:01:48.205 --> 01:01:49.991
There's a whole other
world right there

01:01:50.207 --> 01:01:52.824
and it's just filled with magic!

01:01:54.920 --> 01:01:57.161
But you're destroying
this world to get it!

01:01:57.380 --> 01:01:58.711
So what?

01:01:58.924 --> 01:02:00.540
There's more magic there.

01:02:00.759 --> 01:02:03.296
And I want to understand it all!

01:02:03.511 --> 01:02:05.627
(whirring, zap)

01:02:05.847 --> 01:02:09.135
(people scream, chatter)

01:02:13.104 --> 01:02:14.765
Don't let go!

01:02:22.113 --> 01:02:23.854
(screams)
Hang on!

01:02:24.074 --> 01:02:25.940
Obviously!

01:02:26.159 --> 01:02:27.900
And it's just filled with magic!

01:02:28.119 --> 01:02:29.655
We've got you!

01:02:41.508 --> 01:02:44.500
(orchestral music)

01:02:51.810 --> 01:02:52.800
This isn't the way!

01:02:53.019 --> 01:02:55.226
I know you feel
powerful right now,

01:02:55.438 --> 01:02:57.429
like you can have
everything you want!

01:02:57.649 --> 01:02:58.810
I've been where you are,

01:02:59.025 --> 01:03:01.608
I've made the same
mistake you're making.

01:03:01.820 --> 01:03:04.027
I put on a crown and
just like you I was

01:03:04.239 --> 01:03:06.731
overwhelmed by the
magic it contained.

01:03:06.950 --> 01:03:09.612
I thought it could get
me everything I wanted.

01:03:09.828 --> 01:03:11.159
Oh, you're wrong.

01:03:11.371 --> 01:03:14.989
Unlike you, I can have
everything I want!

01:03:15.208 --> 01:03:16.824
No you can't.

01:03:17.043 --> 01:03:18.750
Even with all that
magic and power

01:03:18.962 --> 01:03:20.953
you'll still be alone!

01:03:21.172 --> 01:03:24.130
True magic comes from honesty,

01:03:24.342 --> 01:03:27.255
loyalty, laughter,

01:03:27.470 --> 01:03:31.054
generosity, kindness...

01:03:34.686 --> 01:03:36.597
I understand you, Twilight.

01:03:36.813 --> 01:03:40.807
And I want to show you the
most important magic of all!

01:03:41.026 --> 01:03:42.733
(explosion)

01:03:45.780 --> 01:03:48.943
(majestic music)

01:03:52.537 --> 01:03:54.574
The magic of friendship.

01:04:00.253 --> 01:04:02.585
(whirring)

01:04:07.344 --> 01:04:09.585
(loud zap)

01:04:09.804 --> 01:04:12.637
(intense music)

01:04:16.895 --> 01:04:18.135
(maniacal laughter)

01:04:22.317 --> 01:04:23.603
Twilight!

01:04:27.364 --> 01:04:28.729
Spike...

01:04:34.704 --> 01:04:37.287
No!

01:04:43.755 --> 01:04:45.712
Take my hand, Twilight.

01:04:45.924 --> 01:04:48.416
Let me show you
there's another way.

01:04:48.635 --> 01:04:50.717
Just like someone
once did for me.

01:04:56.184 --> 01:04:59.643
(soft orchestral music)

01:05:14.452 --> 01:05:16.159
I'm so sorry.

01:05:16.371 --> 01:05:18.863
I didn't mean for any
of this to happen.

01:05:19.082 --> 01:05:20.072
I know.

01:05:20.291 --> 01:05:22.532
And going by my own experiences,

01:05:22.752 --> 01:05:24.163
they'll forgive you.

01:05:27.799 --> 01:05:29.540
(barking)

01:05:29.759 --> 01:05:31.124
(giggling)

01:05:34.973 --> 01:05:36.463
Principal Celestia,

01:05:36.683 --> 01:05:38.515
on behalf of Crystal
Prep I demand

01:05:38.726 --> 01:05:41.309
that you forfeit the
Friendship Games.

01:05:41.521 --> 01:05:43.979
Clearly CHS has had
unfair advantage

01:05:44.190 --> 01:05:46.727
for quite some time, and
it's certainly obvious

01:05:46.943 --> 01:05:49.150
that your students
have been using magic

01:05:49.362 --> 01:05:50.773
for their own benefit.

01:05:50.989 --> 01:05:52.855
I'd like to think
that saving the world

01:05:53.074 --> 01:05:54.610
benefits us all.

01:05:54.826 --> 01:05:56.237
At least they didn't
manipulate Twilight

01:05:56.453 --> 01:05:58.114
into releasing all the
stolen magic and turning into

01:05:58.329 --> 01:05:59.911
a power-crazed magical
creature that tried to

01:06:00.165 --> 01:06:01.576
rip the world apart
just to win a game.

01:06:03.877 --> 01:06:05.038
Wow.

01:06:05.253 --> 01:06:07.244
That's a lot to take in
when you say it all at once.

01:06:07.464 --> 01:06:09.455
That your students
have been using magic

01:06:09.674 --> 01:06:12.086
Nope, that's pretty
much what happened.

01:06:13.595 --> 01:06:16.804
Actually, we're all to blame.

01:06:17.015 --> 01:06:19.302
Mostly it was her.

01:06:19.517 --> 01:06:22.009
Obviously my students
have been infected

01:06:22.228 --> 01:06:23.639
with your magic!

01:06:23.855 --> 01:06:27.348
I plan on taking all of this
up with the school board!

01:06:27.567 --> 01:06:28.648
Good.

01:06:28.860 --> 01:06:30.442
I'm sure they would
be very interested

01:06:30.653 --> 01:06:33.771
in hearing all about the
magical students with wings.

01:06:33.990 --> 01:06:36.357
Oh, and the portals
to different dimensions.

01:06:36.576 --> 01:06:38.487
And don't forget
to tell them about

01:06:38.703 --> 01:06:40.410
the talking dog.
(chuckles)

01:06:40.622 --> 01:06:43.910
Because that would
never ruin your reputation.

01:06:49.130 --> 01:06:52.748
(orchestral music)

01:06:57.514 --> 01:06:59.425
Well I know these
Friendship Games

01:06:59.641 --> 01:07:01.678
haven't been what
any of us expected,

01:07:01.893 --> 01:07:04.055
but given what we've
all just been through

01:07:04.270 --> 01:07:07.808
I think it's fair to
declare us all winners!

01:07:08.024 --> 01:07:10.140
(cheering)

01:07:18.910 --> 01:07:20.321
I guess that was
one way to finish up

01:07:20.537 --> 01:07:21.868
your time at Crystal Prep.

01:07:22.038 --> 01:07:24.905
Pretty sure Cinch will be
fast-tracking your application

01:07:25.124 --> 01:07:26.580
after all of that.

01:07:26.793 --> 01:07:27.954
I've been thinking
about it, and

01:07:28.169 --> 01:07:29.705
I'm not so sure now is the time

01:07:29.921 --> 01:07:31.286
for me to apply to Everton.

01:07:31.506 --> 01:07:32.541
Really?

01:07:32.757 --> 01:07:34.589
I may know about
a lot of things,

01:07:34.801 --> 01:07:36.587
but friendship isn't
really one of them, and

01:07:36.803 --> 01:07:38.339
I'm definitely not gonna
learn more about it

01:07:38.555 --> 01:07:40.296
by being alone all the time.

01:07:40.515 --> 01:07:43.303
So you're staying
at Crystal Prep?

01:07:43.518 --> 01:07:45.680
Well, it seems the
students here at CHS

01:07:45.895 --> 01:07:47.556
know an awful lot
about the subject.

01:07:47.772 --> 01:07:50.605
I don't suppose...

01:07:50.817 --> 01:07:53.525
You could transfer
to this school instead.

01:07:53.736 --> 01:07:54.726
Really?

01:07:54.946 --> 01:07:57.608
You'd certainly be
missed at Crystal Prep, but

01:07:57.824 --> 01:07:59.781
I think that's a great idea!

01:07:59.993 --> 01:08:01.734
I'll be sure to speak
to Principal Celestia

01:08:01.953 --> 01:08:03.364
about it right away.

01:08:08.751 --> 01:08:10.788
Still no word from
Princess Twilight?

01:08:12.380 --> 01:08:13.495
Not yet.

01:08:13.715 --> 01:08:15.297
But, I think I may
have figured out

01:08:15.508 --> 01:08:17.215
how magic works in this world!

01:08:17.426 --> 01:08:19.509
We pony up when we're
showing the truest part

01:08:19.720 --> 01:08:20.801
of ourselves!

01:08:21.014 --> 01:08:22.675
I was so busy waiting
for someone else

01:08:22.890 --> 01:08:24.631
to give me the answers,
that I gave up

01:08:24.850 --> 01:08:26.716
looking for them myself.

01:08:26.935 --> 01:08:28.596
I'm sure there will be
more magical problems

01:08:28.813 --> 01:08:29.803
that pop up in this world.

01:08:30.023 --> 01:08:32.014
Like Applejack said,
Princess Twilight

01:08:32.233 --> 01:08:34.600
has her own problems to
worry about in Equestria.

01:08:34.819 --> 01:08:37.607
We can't expect her to
always be around to help us.

01:08:37.822 --> 01:08:39.688
But maybe I can be?

01:08:39.907 --> 01:08:42.023
It seems we have
a new Wondercolt

01:08:42.243 --> 01:08:43.654
here at Canterlot High!

01:08:43.870 --> 01:08:45.656
I'm not sure how
much help I could be.

01:08:45.872 --> 01:08:47.408
But I'd like to try!

01:08:47.624 --> 01:08:49.206
If you would all
give me a chance.

01:08:51.961 --> 01:08:53.702
I'm sure I can
count on you girls

01:08:53.921 --> 01:08:55.502
to help her feel at home.

01:08:55.715 --> 01:08:56.830
You sure can.

01:08:57.050 --> 01:09:00.667

01:09:11.898 --> 01:09:14.060

I'm so sorry I
didn't get here sooner.

01:09:23.785 --> 01:09:25.024
I didn't get your messages
until just now because

01:09:25.243 --> 01:09:27.281
I was caught in this time
travel loop, and honestly

01:09:27.497 --> 01:09:29.828
it was the strangest thing
that's ever happened to me!

01:09:33.752 --> 01:09:35.710
(slurping soda)

01:09:37.048 --> 01:09:40.541
Make that the second strangest.
