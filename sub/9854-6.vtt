00:10.488 --> 00:13.490
<i>Previously on
The Pillars of the Earth...</i>

00:13.558 --> 00:16.193
<i>They've captured the king.</i>

00:16.261 --> 00:18.028
We need to hold Stephen's son

00:18.096 --> 00:19.863
<i>until his father
has left the country</i>

00:19.931 --> 00:22.132
<i>and peace has been kept
for 5 years.</i>

00:22.200 --> 00:23.400
<i>We are betrayed!</i>

00:23.468 --> 00:26.637
Does he honestly think
we'll spare his son?

00:26.705 --> 00:29.173
What makes you think
there'll even be a new church?

00:29.240 --> 00:31.041
Because I will build it.

00:31.109 --> 00:33.677
<i>When my chisel hits the rock,</i>

00:33.745 --> 00:36.280
<i>it's a song
of what will be.</i>

00:39.284 --> 00:42.019
I'm a master stonemason.
Send him away, Da, not me.

00:42.087 --> 00:45.155
I burned the old cathedral
so that you would have work.

00:45.223 --> 00:46.356
Get out!

00:46.424 --> 00:48.592
Kingsbridge is planning
a fleece fair.

00:48.660 --> 00:50.594
Let's make your mother proud.

02:41.773 --> 02:43.774
He was my friend.

02:45.043 --> 02:47.477
He gave us this cathedral.

02:47.545 --> 02:49.646
We planned

02:49.714 --> 02:51.849
and argued

02:51.916 --> 02:53.517
and dreamed.

02:56.054 --> 02:58.021
It seems impossible...

02:59.123 --> 03:00.958
that he is gone.

03:03.695 --> 03:05.195
He...

03:14.439 --> 03:17.608
William Hamleigh burned
it down and murdered Tom.

03:17.675 --> 03:21.211
He tried to burn me too,
but Alfred put out the flames.

03:21.279 --> 03:23.347
He should hang for this!

03:23.414 --> 03:24.481
Who will arrest him?

03:24.549 --> 03:26.183
There is no king.
There is no queen.

03:26.251 --> 03:28.051
There is no law in this land!

03:28.119 --> 03:30.153
There will be soon.
The war's over.

03:30.221 --> 03:32.589
Maud and Gloucester
have fled to France

03:32.657 --> 03:34.258
and Stephen is king again.

03:35.426 --> 03:37.594
Oh God!

03:38.730 --> 03:40.364
Oh dear God!

03:40.431 --> 03:41.999
What?

03:42.066 --> 03:44.268
It was Maud who gave
the license for the fair!

03:44.335 --> 03:45.535
It's over.
We're ruined!

03:45.603 --> 03:47.170
There is nothing left!

03:47.238 --> 03:48.639
Nothing?

03:48.706 --> 03:51.475
I... I need money for
a horse and weapons!

03:51.542 --> 03:53.644
All my gold went
to Philip to pay Maud.

03:53.711 --> 03:55.279
And all my wool
went up in flames!

03:55.346 --> 03:57.948
We are poor again, Richard!

03:58.016 --> 03:59.249
I need the money.

03:59.317 --> 04:00.984
I can't buy weapons
and pay men.

04:01.052 --> 04:02.619
I can't fight for Stephen!

04:02.687 --> 04:05.055
- What am I supposed do?
- I can't support myself!

04:05.123 --> 04:06.823
I have done
everything I could do!

04:06.891 --> 04:08.659
I have done enough!

04:31.950 --> 04:33.317
I want to replace him.

04:33.384 --> 04:35.886
I'm a master builder.

04:35.954 --> 04:38.288
Father gave me his tools.

04:38.356 --> 04:40.057
I know the site and the plans.

04:40.124 --> 04:43.193
You don't have the experience.

04:43.261 --> 04:45.896
Neither did he
when you hired him.

04:47.098 --> 04:48.865
I have his ambition.

04:48.933 --> 04:50.334
And I have his skill.

04:50.401 --> 04:53.403
The men listen to me,
and I'm willing to learn.

04:53.471 --> 04:55.072
I need to pray on this, Alfred.

04:55.139 --> 04:57.541
No, you need to
think of the future.

04:58.543 --> 05:00.043
I have.

05:00.111 --> 05:01.945
Let me show you.

05:06.584 --> 05:08.485
I want to vault
the cathedral in stone.

05:08.553 --> 05:09.619
That's impossible.

05:09.687 --> 05:11.588
Tom said that wood
is the only material...

05:11.656 --> 05:13.924
Wood is cheaper, yes,
but it can burn.

05:13.992 --> 05:16.727
That's how you lost
the first cathedral.

05:18.262 --> 05:20.764
Will the walls take the weight?

05:20.832 --> 05:22.599
Yeah, we can reinforce them.

05:22.667 --> 05:24.801
I know more about stone
than he ever did.

05:24.869 --> 05:26.503
It will cost more
and take longer.

05:26.571 --> 05:28.205
But it will last forever.

05:28.272 --> 05:29.773
That's the point, isn't it?

05:29.841 --> 05:31.975
That why you're
building this church.

05:32.043 --> 05:34.211
God's mark on history.

05:37.982 --> 05:40.584
I can do it cheaper than Da.

05:40.651 --> 05:42.686
You can pay me less.

05:52.196 --> 05:54.531
He wanted to tell me something.

05:54.599 --> 05:56.099
Who?

05:56.167 --> 05:58.869
Tom Builder.
But he went away.

06:06.611 --> 06:08.211
What do you think
Heaven's like?

06:08.279 --> 06:09.946
High up.

06:10.014 --> 06:12.015
What else? Who do
you think is there?

06:12.083 --> 06:13.283
My ma.

06:13.351 --> 06:14.618
Yes.

06:14.685 --> 06:17.120
Did Tom Builder go to see her?

06:17.188 --> 06:18.955
Yes. Yes, he did.

06:19.023 --> 06:20.390
He knew her?

06:21.826 --> 06:25.028
Tom Builder had a secret.

06:25.096 --> 06:28.465
He didn't think
I suspected, but, uh,

06:28.533 --> 06:32.202
his daughter, Martha, confirmed
it to me after he went away.

06:33.237 --> 06:34.638
What secret?

06:34.705 --> 06:38.175
Tom loved your mother
very, very much.

06:38.242 --> 06:42.212
And he went to tell her
what a wonderful boy you are.

06:42.280 --> 06:45.415
And he went to build
her a beautiful home.

06:45.483 --> 06:48.318
And there will be a room
in that home for you one day.

06:48.386 --> 06:51.822
Although, you probably won't
need it for a very long time.

06:53.057 --> 06:55.025
All right, go to bed now.

07:08.739 --> 07:11.074
Who are you writing to?

07:12.477 --> 07:13.910
The king.

07:13.978 --> 07:17.881
There's talk of a crusade,
and I want to volunteer.

07:17.949 --> 07:19.616
As a knight?

07:20.885 --> 07:22.819
As a very poor one.

07:36.400 --> 07:38.902
Oh, Alfred. Come in.

07:44.509 --> 07:45.575
Take a seat.

07:51.582 --> 07:54.651
I've just been told
I am to replace my father.

07:54.719 --> 07:57.921
Congratulations.
He'd be proud.

07:58.990 --> 08:01.158
I'll have a steady income.

08:01.225 --> 08:05.095
Not as much as Da,
but more than I made before.

08:07.131 --> 08:09.900
So I've come to ask
for your hand in marriage.

08:12.336 --> 08:13.503
Alfred!

08:13.571 --> 08:14.671
I saved your life.

08:14.739 --> 08:17.507
- And I appreciate that.
- I love you, Aliena.

08:17.575 --> 08:19.276
Yes, but I will never...

08:19.343 --> 08:20.977
I will take good care of you,

08:21.045 --> 08:24.281
help rebuild your business and
support you brother's knighthood

08:24.348 --> 08:26.550
and quest for
the Earldom of Shiring.

08:30.121 --> 08:33.722
You'd have to sell your house
to maintain his position.

08:33.791 --> 08:35.926
I've saved enough
to let you keep the house

08:35.993 --> 08:38.528
and cover his expenses
as knight and future earl.

08:43.601 --> 08:45.702
I'll leave you alone to talk.

08:46.971 --> 08:48.838
Whatever your decision...

08:49.974 --> 08:51.908
I'll abide by it.

09:06.591 --> 09:08.825
You promised Father.

09:35.653 --> 09:37.053
Ow!

09:38.923 --> 09:41.191
I swear that I will not rest

09:41.259 --> 09:43.326
until Richard is
the Earl of Shiring

09:43.394 --> 09:47.631
and lord of the land
that you once ruled.

10:08.419 --> 10:12.389
Welcome to
my poor home, Lord Archbishop.

10:12.456 --> 10:15.458
Still a ruin
with a roof, I see.

10:15.526 --> 10:19.162
Kingsbridge needs
the stone more than I do.

10:19.230 --> 10:23.033
You'll never succeed me
without a proper place to live.

10:26.103 --> 10:28.605
Never mind going to Rome.

10:28.673 --> 10:32.175
Succeeding you is
farthest from my mind.

10:32.243 --> 10:35.278
And Rome, just a dream.

10:40.618 --> 10:42.986
I beg you once again,
dear Lord,

10:43.054 --> 10:45.255
grant me your sweet favor.

10:49.660 --> 10:52.329
<i>Lady Regan,
as you well know,</i>

10:52.396 --> 10:55.865
<i>our political bets
were entirely well-placed.</i>

10:55.933 --> 10:57.767
<i>Maud and Gloucester
lost their battle</i>

10:57.835 --> 10:59.502
<i>and were forced
to flee to France,</i>

10:59.570 --> 11:01.171
<i>where they now
lick their wounds.</i>

11:01.238 --> 11:04.040
<i>Meanwhile, our dear
King Stephen is back in power.</i>

11:04.108 --> 11:05.575
<i>You see, dear Lady,</i>

11:05.643 --> 11:08.411
<i>it was really wise of you
to have sided with me again.</i>

11:08.479 --> 11:10.480
<i>However, I'd like
to remind you</i>

11:10.548 --> 11:13.016
<i>that our alliance is based
on certain conditions,</i>

11:13.084 --> 11:15.985
<i>which I clearly presented
you with at the Lincoln Chapel.</i>

11:16.053 --> 11:18.421
I wish to be named
Archbishop of Canterbury

11:18.489 --> 11:20.990
once Stephen
regains his throne.

11:21.058 --> 11:24.260
<i>The current one will have
to be removed, of course.</i>

11:24.328 --> 11:25.862
<i>My dear Lord Bishop,</i>

11:25.930 --> 11:28.465
<i>the surest way for me to
sequester the Archbishop</i>

11:28.532 --> 11:29.866
<i>is to bring him to Shiring</i>

11:29.934 --> 11:32.135
<i>on the pretext
of performing some ceremony.</i>

11:32.203 --> 11:33.903
<i>Say... a marriage.</i>

11:33.971 --> 11:36.439
<i>I would need the king's
permission for a wedding.</i>

11:36.507 --> 11:38.341
<i>But I assume you have
yet to give him</i>

11:38.409 --> 11:39.909
<i>my father's precious ring,</i>

11:39.977 --> 11:42.612
<i>else I would have heard
from his gracious Majesty.</i>

11:42.680 --> 11:45.348
<i>You haven't spent it
on your palace, have you?</i>

11:45.416 --> 11:48.885
<i>His Majesty would be
most unhappy to hear that.</i>

11:50.755 --> 11:52.455
Oh...

11:55.426 --> 11:57.927
Why so sad, William?

11:57.995 --> 11:59.596
Hmm?

11:59.663 --> 12:01.297
You've hardly left your bed

12:01.365 --> 12:03.400
since the battle
at Kingsbridge.

12:03.467 --> 12:05.568
I'm going to Hell, Mother.

12:05.636 --> 12:09.272
Oh, my sweet William,
I doubt that.

12:09.340 --> 12:10.807
I killed a man.

12:10.875 --> 12:13.676
I'll be hanged
and I'll burn forever.

12:13.744 --> 12:16.646
But Bishop Waleran forgave
you in advance, my dainty.

12:16.714 --> 12:19.582
Besides, it was a war.
You've killed hundreds in war.

12:19.650 --> 12:21.851
It's not a proper war!

12:21.919 --> 12:23.353
It's very proper.

12:23.421 --> 12:26.256
It's your war
to win the title of earl.

12:26.323 --> 12:28.358
A lost war, a useless war.

12:28.426 --> 12:29.959
We're penniless.

12:31.595 --> 12:34.998
Well, that's what I wanted
to talk to you about.

12:36.400 --> 12:38.334
There was a young lady
you were drawn to

12:38.402 --> 12:39.636
<i>at Maud's court.</i>

12:39.703 --> 12:41.504
<i>And now,
with Stephen in power,</i>

12:41.572 --> 12:43.173
her family are in disfavor.

12:43.240 --> 12:46.176
They want a marriage
to an ally of Stephen's.

12:46.243 --> 12:47.844
And Bishop Waleran assures me

12:47.912 --> 12:50.547
we'll soon be back
in the king's good graces.

12:52.416 --> 12:54.984
They have, by the way...

12:57.054 --> 12:59.489
a lot of money.

13:03.194 --> 13:04.594
Who is it?

13:05.629 --> 13:07.197
Is she pretty?

13:08.199 --> 13:09.699
You thought so.

13:11.302 --> 13:14.037
- Is she a virgin?
- Hmm...

13:15.406 --> 13:17.207
She's only 13.

13:21.345 --> 13:24.113
Now tell me...

13:24.181 --> 13:26.916
whom do you hate the most?

13:26.984 --> 13:28.351
Aliena.

13:29.753 --> 13:32.021
She didn't die in the fire
like I wanted her to.

13:32.089 --> 13:33.790
And what would you do to her?

13:33.858 --> 13:36.960
Have my way with her again
and again until she does die.

13:37.027 --> 13:38.461
Mmm...

13:39.463 --> 13:41.397
And so you shall.

13:42.666 --> 13:44.901
And whom do you love the most?

13:45.903 --> 13:47.237
You.

13:48.873 --> 13:50.440
And what would you do to me?

13:51.709 --> 13:53.877
Fight him, Eustace!

13:54.879 --> 13:57.213
Ow! Ow, my finger!

13:57.281 --> 14:00.216
Where's your guts?
Where's your noble blood?

14:00.284 --> 14:01.751
I don't like fighting!

14:01.819 --> 14:03.853
He's too much with his mother.

14:03.921 --> 14:06.789
If it were up to women,
there would be no wars.

14:06.857 --> 14:09.425
Could you stomach that?
Oh, never, Sire.

14:09.493 --> 14:12.695
I feel so much better
when I'm conquering an enemy.

14:14.131 --> 14:15.665
I'm told it was your idea

14:15.733 --> 14:18.801
to substitute the farm boy
with Eustace, by the way.

14:18.869 --> 14:20.803
Oh, I suppose
I should be grateful.

14:20.871 --> 14:23.506
God inspired me, Your Majesty.

14:27.344 --> 14:29.412
He speaks to me directly now.

14:30.781 --> 14:33.016
He appeared to me in prison

14:33.083 --> 14:35.318
and told me in
no uncertain terms

14:35.386 --> 14:38.288
that the sinking of the
White Ship was part of his plan.

14:38.355 --> 14:41.357
It was a terrible
tragedy, Sire,

14:41.425 --> 14:43.593
but it made you king.

14:43.661 --> 14:46.529
God's plans twist at times,

14:46.597 --> 14:49.432
but always end up
in the greater good.

14:50.634 --> 14:52.135
Quite.

14:55.472 --> 14:57.407
And in order to
further that good,

14:57.474 --> 14:59.242
you might grant
2 small requests.

14:59.310 --> 15:01.477
Lady Regan wants
permission for her son

15:01.545 --> 15:03.112
to marry Elizabeth of Weymouth.

15:03.180 --> 15:06.082
A generous fee will be paid
to the Crown, of course.

15:06.150 --> 15:09.752
Hmm! I'll speak
to God about it.

15:09.820 --> 15:12.288
But I expect he'll say yes.

15:13.991 --> 15:16.125
The second favor?

15:16.193 --> 15:20.163
The Archbishop of Canterbury
is failing, Sire.

15:20.230 --> 15:22.966
You'll soon need
to name a successor.

15:23.033 --> 15:24.901
Good!

15:38.749 --> 15:40.249
Hmm!

15:40.317 --> 15:42.518
I didn't know he was ill.

15:42.586 --> 15:44.487
Yeah! Now the right.

15:45.756 --> 15:46.990
That's it, Henry.

15:47.057 --> 15:49.959
Protect your mama
from the evil Stephen!

15:50.027 --> 15:51.961
Ah!

15:54.231 --> 15:56.733
You let me win, Uncle Robert.

15:56.800 --> 15:59.402
No, Henry, on my word of honor.

15:59.470 --> 16:00.937
Your mother's right.

16:01.005 --> 16:04.107
Soon you too will be fighting
Stephen for our crown.

16:09.113 --> 16:12.315
Today, on this
third Sunday in July,

16:12.383 --> 16:15.118
I announce
the banns of marriage

16:15.185 --> 16:17.120
between Alfred,

16:17.187 --> 16:19.922
son of Tom Builder,

16:19.990 --> 16:22.425
and Aliena of Shiring.

16:22.493 --> 16:25.094
They're to be married
in two weeks time.

16:25.162 --> 16:26.696
May God's blessings descend...

16:26.764 --> 16:28.598
No!

16:33.103 --> 16:34.237
She's mine.

16:35.572 --> 16:36.839
You cannot take her.

16:38.976 --> 16:40.777
You will not take her!

16:40.844 --> 16:42.145
Not here, Jack.

16:42.212 --> 16:44.013
Aliena!

16:44.081 --> 16:46.416
Aliena!

16:46.483 --> 16:49.452
No! God help me!

16:55.559 --> 16:57.760
Don't make me chain you, Jack!

16:57.828 --> 17:00.496
I must keep you here,
for your own good,

17:00.564 --> 17:02.865
until the marriage
is performed.

17:04.233 --> 17:07.136
Now, I hope you
can use this time

17:07.204 --> 17:10.006
to decide on whether or not
you wish to remain a monk.

17:10.074 --> 17:11.441
It is my path to God,

17:11.508 --> 17:14.510
but I see now that
it might not be yours.

17:15.512 --> 17:17.613
If you...

17:18.949 --> 17:21.349
decide to leave, I understand.

17:22.920 --> 17:26.823
But you will be banished
from Kingsbridge forever.

17:33.997 --> 17:35.531
<i>My dear Bishop,</i>

17:35.599 --> 17:38.301
<i>knowing of your interest
in Jack Jackson,</i>

17:38.368 --> 17:41.237
<i>I write to inform you
that he's being held in prison,</i>

17:41.305 --> 17:44.006
<i>due to an attachment
he seems to have formed</i>

17:44.074 --> 17:45.608
<i>with Aliena of Shiring.</i>

17:45.676 --> 17:47.643
<i>She's soon to be
married to Alfred.</i>

17:47.711 --> 17:49.645
<i>And Jack Jackson,
now a monk,</i>

17:49.713 --> 17:53.616
<i>has expressed displeasure
in rather violent terms.</i>

17:53.684 --> 17:55.952
<i>He will be kept
in our basement cell</i>

17:56.019 --> 17:58.788
<i>until after
the wedding ceremony.</i>

18:01.892 --> 18:03.726
<i>Brother Remigius,</i>

18:03.794 --> 18:07.830
<i>if what you say is true,
God's wishes are clear.</i>

18:07.898 --> 18:10.199
<i>Jack Jackson's mother
is a witch,</i>

18:10.267 --> 18:12.368
<i>and he's the
Devil's offspring.</i>

18:12.436 --> 18:15.204
<i>His blasphemous stonework
attests to that.</i>

18:15.272 --> 18:18.040
<i>For years, he has been
an irritant to God's plan,</i>

18:18.108 --> 18:21.277
<i>and now God
wants him stopped.</i>

18:21.345 --> 18:23.079
<i>Spice his dinner
with the contents</i>

18:23.147 --> 18:24.413
<i>of the enclosed package.</i>

18:24.481 --> 18:26.949
<i>A pinch should suffice.</i>

18:27.017 --> 18:29.285
<i>And have it delivered
to the prisoner</i>

18:29.353 --> 18:32.822
<i>by a monk he knows
and trusts.</i>

18:32.890 --> 18:36.726
<i>Ego te absolvo.
In the name of Jesus Christ.</i>

18:40.731 --> 18:43.966
You'll be free
this time tomorrow.

18:44.034 --> 18:45.935
You ought to be happy.

18:46.003 --> 18:48.938
She'll be wed this
time tomorrow, Johnny.

18:49.006 --> 18:51.307
I will never be happy again.

18:59.583 --> 19:02.985
I'll be seeing these on
my wedding night, boys. Hey?

19:03.053 --> 19:05.688
Hey, hey!
Get your hands off, hey?

19:05.756 --> 19:07.890
You better get us some of that!

19:07.958 --> 19:09.859
Oh, hey! Hey!

19:09.927 --> 19:11.727
Hey, boys! Hey, boys!

19:11.795 --> 19:15.164
On my wedding night, wait till
she gets ahold of that.

19:46.129 --> 19:47.797
- Shhh, quiet.
- Mother!

19:47.865 --> 19:49.432
The monks will hear you.

19:49.499 --> 19:51.367
- Who told you I was here?
- Martha.

19:51.435 --> 19:54.503
It broke her heart
to hear you were imprisoned.

19:54.571 --> 19:57.273
I think she's
a little taken with you.

19:57.341 --> 19:58.708
How did you get in here?

19:58.775 --> 20:01.410
The water channel
runs under here.

20:01.478 --> 20:04.881
It's how I visited your father
and got pregnant with you.

20:04.948 --> 20:06.315
My father?

20:06.383 --> 20:08.217
Yes, it was here.

20:08.285 --> 20:10.353
The prior who said
he stole the chalice

20:10.420 --> 20:13.222
was the Prior of
Kingsbridge, Prior James.

20:13.290 --> 20:15.558
He died just before
Philip took charge.

20:15.626 --> 20:17.627
Philip was raised
by Prior James.

20:17.694 --> 20:19.729
So that's why you mistrust him?

20:21.331 --> 20:24.567
But he had nothing to do
with Father's death, did he?

20:24.635 --> 20:28.437
Your father was brought here
after they found him.

20:38.982 --> 20:41.717
<i>It was my fault
that he was found.</i>

20:43.887 --> 20:46.055
So I decided to free him.

20:46.123 --> 20:48.491
I left my convent
and traveled here

20:48.558 --> 20:50.226
and bribed one of the monks,

20:50.294 --> 20:52.495
who revealed to me
the secret entrance

20:52.562 --> 20:54.196
from the outside world.

20:56.900 --> 20:58.801
I couldn't free him.

20:59.870 --> 21:01.704
He was chained.

21:03.473 --> 21:05.708
And all I could do was...

21:06.977 --> 21:08.577
love him.

21:42.612 --> 21:45.147
The next week, he was
taken to another cell.

21:45.215 --> 21:48.718
I didn't lay eyes on him
until the day he was burned.

21:49.853 --> 21:52.855
I wanted him to see his son.

21:54.191 --> 21:57.360
Why would Prior James
accuse him falsely?

21:57.427 --> 21:59.628
He was acting
under orders, I'm sure.

21:59.696 --> 22:01.063
Under whose orders?

22:01.131 --> 22:03.232
Whoever wanted
your father silenced.

22:05.268 --> 22:07.670
Whatever he knew,
it died with him.

22:07.738 --> 22:10.740
Unless it was somehow
connected to his ring.

22:12.209 --> 22:14.777
- My ring that Alfred stole?
- Yes.

22:16.680 --> 22:18.147
You love Aliena, don't you?

22:18.215 --> 22:20.783
She doesn't love me, Ma.
She said it was impossible.

22:20.851 --> 22:22.184
Go to her.

22:22.252 --> 22:25.388
Ask her why, then do what
your father and I could not.

22:25.455 --> 22:26.922
Run away together.

22:28.225 --> 22:30.326
Eat something.
You need your strength.

22:31.828 --> 22:33.496
Eat.

24:49.833 --> 24:52.868
I wish this night
could last forever.

24:53.937 --> 24:55.471
I want to marry you.

24:55.539 --> 24:58.073
Shhh! Richard will hear.

24:58.141 --> 24:59.675
We'll run away together.

24:59.743 --> 25:02.077
I've lost my money,
and you have nothing.

25:02.145 --> 25:03.512
I've got my hands.

25:03.580 --> 25:06.282
I can get work on any church
in the world, I'm sure of it.

25:06.349 --> 25:08.284
It's not enough.

25:08.351 --> 25:10.386
I made an oath to my father...

25:11.988 --> 25:15.791
that I would do everything to
help Richard regain his title.

25:16.793 --> 25:18.594
That might be never.

25:20.297 --> 25:22.131
An oath's just words, Aliena.

25:22.199 --> 25:24.934
It's nothing compared to this.

25:26.136 --> 25:27.536
Come away.

25:29.139 --> 25:31.607
I have to marry Alfred.

25:41.218 --> 25:44.687
No. No, I can't
give you up again.

25:44.754 --> 25:46.388
It's my duty, Jack.

25:46.456 --> 25:47.856
No, your duty is to me.

25:47.924 --> 25:49.191
Oh!

25:49.259 --> 25:51.160
- What? What is it?
- Nothing. It's you.

25:51.228 --> 25:53.929
I will go away and
you'll never see me again.

25:53.997 --> 25:56.765
Is that what you want?
Is it what you want?

26:01.705 --> 26:04.106
Jack! Jack!

26:16.086 --> 26:18.921
Drink this! It will
get the poison out of you.

26:18.989 --> 26:20.489
It was Alfred, wasn't it?

26:20.557 --> 26:23.192
He had one of the monks
put something into your food.

26:25.829 --> 26:27.162
Damn him!

26:29.733 --> 26:31.634
Wake up, William.

26:33.236 --> 26:34.603
Wake up!

26:35.639 --> 26:38.507
Today is your special day.

27:21.451 --> 27:24.486
Alfred, son of Tom Builder,

27:24.554 --> 27:26.989
I take you as my husband.

27:27.057 --> 27:29.858
And swear to be
faithful, always.

27:31.261 --> 27:34.530
William and Elizabeth,
you are now married

27:34.597 --> 27:36.865
<i>in the eyes of God.</i>

27:39.969 --> 27:42.237
<i>Alfred and Aliena
are now married</i>

27:42.305 --> 27:43.605
in the eyes of God.

27:43.673 --> 27:45.341
And may God's blessing...

27:45.408 --> 27:46.975
I curse this wedding!

27:52.182 --> 27:55.017
I curse this marriage
with sorrow.

27:55.085 --> 27:57.019
I curse this marriage
with impotence!

27:57.087 --> 27:59.822
With hatred, with regret

27:59.889 --> 28:01.824
and bitterness.

28:43.433 --> 28:45.033
Oh God, you're lifeless!

28:45.101 --> 28:47.269
It's like making love
to a corpse!

28:47.337 --> 28:48.771
What can I do?

28:48.838 --> 28:49.905
Enjoy it!

29:26.142 --> 29:28.877
- Good morning, Archbishop.
- Lady Regan!

29:28.945 --> 29:30.245
What a delight.

29:30.313 --> 29:32.114
You're an early
riser too, I see.

29:33.550 --> 29:35.818
I wanted to speak with you
in private, if I may.

29:35.885 --> 29:38.720
I have a rather troubling
confession to make.

29:38.788 --> 29:40.189
Well, I'm sorry.

29:40.256 --> 29:43.459
Isn't Bishop Waleran
your confessor?

29:43.526 --> 29:45.027
Yes.

29:45.094 --> 29:46.862
But my sin is for the ears

29:46.930 --> 29:50.032
of the Archbishop
of Canterbury himself.

29:50.099 --> 29:52.868
I don't understand.

29:54.237 --> 29:56.505
I have been asked to...

30:00.543 --> 30:03.812
I have been asked
to commit a murder.

30:05.114 --> 30:06.748
Oh, my dear.

30:08.418 --> 30:10.052
By whom?

30:11.087 --> 30:12.855
Bishop Waleran.

30:12.922 --> 30:14.656
Which is why I can't...

30:14.724 --> 30:17.559
Yes... I see.

30:19.095 --> 30:20.829
He mustn't know
that I've told you.

30:20.897 --> 30:23.298
No, my dear.
My lips are sealed.

30:26.870 --> 30:30.506
Whom does he wish
you to murder?

30:34.811 --> 30:36.144
You.

30:55.465 --> 30:57.065
So where will you go?

30:57.133 --> 30:59.001
I don't know.
France, maybe.

30:59.068 --> 31:01.837
Search for Father's family.

31:06.009 --> 31:08.310
Jack! Jack!

31:08.378 --> 31:10.412
I want to come with you!

31:11.447 --> 31:13.148
No, Martha.

31:13.216 --> 31:14.883
He must go alone.

31:51.187 --> 31:54.289
Canterbury's a much nicer
palace and already built.

32:29.592 --> 32:31.093
What do you want now?

32:31.160 --> 32:32.494
My son's title.

32:32.562 --> 32:34.262
I've cleared the path
for your ascent,

32:34.330 --> 32:37.232
and Stephen hasn't confirmed
William as Shiring's earl.

32:37.300 --> 32:39.668
You promised he would.
Promises take time.

32:39.736 --> 32:42.170
I've waited months for
my confirmation as Archbishop.

32:42.238 --> 32:43.905
You've been waiting
all your life.

32:43.973 --> 32:45.307
I doubt it ends at Archbishop.

32:45.375 --> 32:46.508
Patience is a virtue...

32:46.576 --> 32:49.311
I have been patient
with you for 24 years!

32:51.714 --> 32:53.448
You'd burn for it, William.

32:53.516 --> 32:55.417
Nonsense.

32:55.485 --> 32:59.354
You forgave him all
his crimes, remember?

32:59.422 --> 33:00.689
Slit his throat.

33:02.692 --> 33:04.459
I'll talk to the king
Sunday next

33:04.527 --> 33:05.827
when he visits Kingsbridge.

33:05.895 --> 33:07.129
What brings him there?

33:07.196 --> 33:09.364
May Day Philip
dedicates his cathedral.

33:09.432 --> 33:10.966
- It's finished?
- No, not nearly.

33:11.034 --> 33:12.467
But it's been vaulted.

33:15.972 --> 33:17.205
Thank you.

33:24.714 --> 33:26.882
Hold it steady!

33:27.917 --> 33:29.885
That's it!

33:35.525 --> 33:37.025
Mmm...

33:47.904 --> 33:49.771
Please, Alfred mustn't know.

33:49.839 --> 33:51.707
He hasn't noticed.

34:32.849 --> 34:34.716
Oh, the light!

34:37.253 --> 34:38.853
Thank you.

34:40.188 --> 34:42.056
Plenty of place to worship.

34:42.125 --> 34:44.126
It's a miracle
they finished it in time.

34:44.193 --> 34:45.226
They rushed it.

34:45.293 --> 34:47.228
They took down the
falsework this morning.

34:47.295 --> 34:49.431
Like I said, it's a miracle.

34:55.371 --> 34:56.772
Brother.

34:57.940 --> 35:00.208
Is it too late
to ask forgiveness?

35:00.276 --> 35:02.944
Kate. Little sister.

35:03.012 --> 35:05.747
You've prayed for this
for a long time.

35:05.815 --> 35:07.883
It's eating me away.

35:07.950 --> 35:10.218
My life.

35:10.286 --> 35:13.221
I want to serve God, like you.

35:15.558 --> 35:18.994
The consecrated part
of our cathedral is now,

35:19.061 --> 35:20.529
at last, vaulted.

35:21.764 --> 35:23.365
We could not have come this far

35:23.432 --> 35:25.600
without the divinely
guided support

35:25.668 --> 35:27.903
of our good King Stephen.

35:27.970 --> 35:30.472
And our blessed Bishop Waleran,

35:30.540 --> 35:33.575
whose elevation to
Archbishop of Canterbury

35:33.643 --> 35:35.076
we celebrate here today.

35:35.144 --> 35:39.347
But equal honor is due
to a man who is not here.

35:39.415 --> 35:41.783
His name is Tom Builder.

35:41.851 --> 35:45.854
And his death casts
a shadow on this day.

35:47.223 --> 35:51.226
He would have been
so very proud and happy.

35:58.301 --> 35:59.868
Thank you, Prior Philip.

35:59.936 --> 36:02.938
We have another honor
to celebrate today.

36:03.005 --> 36:05.240
I have been speaking
with His Royal Highness,

36:05.308 --> 36:08.844
and he has given me
permission to announce,

36:08.911 --> 36:11.112
with great pride and pleasure,

36:11.180 --> 36:13.481
the confirmation
of William Hamleigh

36:13.549 --> 36:15.417
as Earl of Shiring.

36:16.686 --> 36:18.253
Yes!

36:18.321 --> 36:20.088
Yes!

36:55.691 --> 36:57.092
It's the roof!

37:11.007 --> 37:12.908
My Lord, this way!
This way!

38:54.543 --> 38:56.711
Where is my son?

39:07.124 --> 39:09.225
Sweet Jesus! Why?

39:10.794 --> 39:13.796
She came to You for mercy,
and this is Your answer?

39:14.965 --> 39:16.832
I gave my life to you!

39:18.001 --> 39:19.635
Why did you kill my sister?

39:19.703 --> 39:21.137
Why Kate?

39:21.204 --> 39:23.539
Where's Aliena?

39:23.607 --> 39:25.274
I don't know.

39:27.044 --> 39:28.744
Aliena!

39:31.181 --> 39:32.948
Aliena!

39:35.252 --> 39:37.420
Brother Thomas...

40:07.484 --> 40:09.518
Help me! Somebody!

40:18.328 --> 40:20.296
Brother, help us!

40:30.173 --> 40:31.841
No.

40:57.868 --> 41:00.569
Whore!

41:07.344 --> 41:08.944
How many died?

41:10.046 --> 41:11.480
79.

41:13.483 --> 41:15.584
- And what caused it?
- No one knows.

41:15.652 --> 41:17.052
It was Alfred's fault.

41:17.120 --> 41:18.521
He took down the falsework

41:18.588 --> 41:20.656
before the mortar
had properly dried.

41:20.724 --> 41:22.024
The prior made him rush.

41:22.092 --> 41:24.660
Don't blame Philip!
The walls weren't strong enough!

41:24.728 --> 41:26.162
There'll be an examination!

41:26.229 --> 41:28.497
Silence! Hmm?

41:30.834 --> 41:34.670
It is clear, Prior Philip.
Bad decisions were made.

41:34.738 --> 41:36.739
And the ultimate responsibility

41:36.806 --> 41:38.541
for those decisions
lies with you.

41:38.608 --> 41:41.544
An investigation will
be conducted, Eminence.

41:41.611 --> 41:44.713
And its conclusions will be
weighed by your successor,

41:44.781 --> 41:46.315
when he is chosen.

41:46.383 --> 41:48.484
There will be no successor.

41:48.552 --> 41:51.554
King Stephen took
today's misfortune

41:51.621 --> 41:53.889
as a sign from God.

41:53.957 --> 41:57.693
He is reneging on his promise
to name me Archbishop.

42:00.297 --> 42:01.964
I am sorry.

42:02.032 --> 42:03.832
Are you?

42:03.900 --> 42:06.302
Your pride betrays you, Philip.

42:06.369 --> 42:09.071
It's pride that orders
a roof of stones

42:09.139 --> 42:11.140
and denies culpability
when it collapses.

42:11.208 --> 42:13.509
I order you to resign
as Prior of Kingsbridge,

42:13.577 --> 42:15.077
effective immediately.

42:16.880 --> 42:19.882
With all due humility,
my Lord Bishop,

42:19.950 --> 42:22.218
that must be put to a vote.

42:27.724 --> 42:30.192
May I be heard, Your Eminence?

42:32.329 --> 42:35.731
The vault may indeed
have collapsed

42:35.799 --> 42:38.400
because it was improperly
built and rushed.

42:39.703 --> 42:43.105
But those are merely
material causes.

42:43.173 --> 42:46.475
There is a divine cause too,
as there is in all things.

42:46.543 --> 42:48.110
Oh, get to the point, Remigius.

42:48.178 --> 42:49.645
The statue of St. Adolphus

42:49.713 --> 42:51.714
and the skull it carried
were crushed.

42:51.781 --> 42:52.881
Yes?

42:52.949 --> 42:54.717
This is my point,
Your Eminence.

42:54.784 --> 42:57.720
The vault fell
on Philip's deception.

42:58.922 --> 43:01.590
What are you talking about?

43:01.658 --> 43:03.826
I ask you, Philip,

43:03.893 --> 43:06.695
did the skull belong
to St. Adolphus or not?

43:06.763 --> 43:08.163
Of course it did.

43:08.231 --> 43:09.465
Let the prior speak.

43:12.269 --> 43:14.536
I lied.

43:14.604 --> 43:17.072
The original relic
was destroyed in the fire.

43:18.808 --> 43:20.743
I substituted a skull
from the crypt.

43:20.810 --> 43:22.811
Without the relic,
or something like that,

43:22.879 --> 43:24.513
people wouldn't come to worship

43:24.581 --> 43:27.216
and the cathedral
could not be built.

43:27.284 --> 43:28.684
"Pride goeth

43:28.752 --> 43:30.753
"before destruction
and a haughty spirit."

43:30.820 --> 43:32.821
There haven't been
miracles for 50 years.

43:32.889 --> 43:34.690
The other skull
was probably false too.

43:34.758 --> 43:36.558
That's blasphemy, Prior Philip!

43:36.626 --> 43:39.328
How did you know about this,
Remigius? Were you spying?

43:39.396 --> 43:40.729
Enough!

43:43.500 --> 43:46.435
Philip has deceived us all.

43:46.503 --> 43:48.337
Wasting thousands
of pounds building

43:48.405 --> 43:50.439
a cathedral which
should've been abandoned.

43:50.507 --> 43:52.574
And in the process,
killing 79 people,

43:52.642 --> 43:54.677
including your sister,
the whore.

43:54.744 --> 43:56.679
She came to be shriven,
Your Eminence.

43:56.746 --> 43:58.147
Not in good time.

43:58.214 --> 44:01.216
She will be buried now
in unholy ground.

44:01.284 --> 44:03.118
Philip has sent her to Hell.

44:05.989 --> 44:07.690
These are reasons enough,
I think,

44:07.757 --> 44:10.492
for your monks to
vote you out of office.

44:15.632 --> 44:17.533
Your cathedral is done for.

44:17.600 --> 44:20.903
Your ambition crushed.

44:20.970 --> 44:23.772
This is what comes
of arrogance, Philip.

44:30.714 --> 44:32.047
Get out!

44:32.115 --> 44:33.315
This is my house!

44:33.383 --> 44:34.883
It's mine now!
You married me!

44:34.951 --> 44:36.952
Alfred, please,
I have nowhere else to go!

44:37.020 --> 44:38.854
That is not my affair.

44:45.261 --> 44:47.563
You slept with Jack Jackson!

44:47.630 --> 44:48.931
Before we married.

44:48.998 --> 44:51.333
When were you gonna tell me?

44:51.401 --> 44:55.738
Making love to Jack
was the greatest sin

44:55.805 --> 44:57.906
I've ever committed.

44:57.974 --> 45:00.142
And I ask God and you
for forgiveness.

45:00.210 --> 45:02.678
You are a whore and a liar

45:02.746 --> 45:05.981
and have made me
a cuckold and a fool!

45:13.089 --> 45:15.290
It was also...

45:15.358 --> 45:18.861
the only true good thing
I have done in my entire life.

45:53.930 --> 45:55.230
Ellen!

46:00.103 --> 46:01.770
I hear I have a grandson.

46:07.210 --> 46:08.610
What happened?

46:08.678 --> 46:10.879
Alfred kicked me out.

46:10.947 --> 46:12.581
You'll stay with me then.

46:12.649 --> 46:14.016
Let me see him.

46:16.019 --> 46:18.554
Well... there's no doubt
he's Jack's.

46:19.689 --> 46:21.056
He's small, but tough.

46:21.124 --> 46:22.558
Tough like his grandmother.

46:22.625 --> 46:24.460
May I?

46:28.631 --> 46:29.898
Hey...

46:32.969 --> 46:35.103
You have to find him, Aliena.

46:35.171 --> 46:36.605
My grandson needs his father.

46:36.673 --> 46:38.106
Where did he go?
Do you know?

46:38.174 --> 46:39.741
To seek his own
father's family.

46:39.809 --> 46:41.710
To France?

46:41.778 --> 46:44.346
How... how could I
possibly find him there?

46:45.381 --> 46:46.715
Do you love him?

46:46.783 --> 46:48.550
Yes.

46:49.552 --> 46:51.186
Then you'll find him.
