WEBVTT

00:02.000 --> 00:05.080
'I here present unto you, Queen
Elizabeth, your undoubted queen.'

00:05.080 --> 00:08.320
We'll have no truck with a queen
who thought to rule her husband

00:08.320 --> 00:10.640
and rule England through him.

00:10.640 --> 00:15.600
My Lords! Our one-time king, Henry,
and now, our prisoner.

00:15.600 --> 00:18.640
Your father is asking
King Edward for the royal dukes,

00:18.640 --> 00:21.040
his brothers, to be given
in marriage to the two of you.

00:21.040 --> 00:24.200
Give him something. But not this.

00:24.200 --> 00:27.160
Warwick has betrayed me!
And so has George!

00:27.160 --> 00:30.640
For now I hear he has married
Isabel against my clear command!

00:30.640 --> 00:33.200
My wedding was never for me at all.

00:33.200 --> 00:37.000
It was a sign from Father that men
should rise against the King.

00:37.000 --> 00:40.280
You will be
King Henry Tudor of England.

00:40.280 --> 00:43.120
Ignore what your mother just
said, Henry, for it is treason

00:43.120 --> 00:45.120
and she would surely lose
her head for it.

00:45.120 --> 00:48.640
Our father...and John...
they're dead.

00:48.640 --> 00:51.400
There was no charge,
only the word of Warwick.

00:51.400 --> 00:54.120
He's done it. Father has the King!

00:54.120 --> 00:58.120
Richard Neville, Earl of Warwick.
I curse you.

00:58.120 --> 01:02.000
By my will, you shall die.

01:04.000 --> 01:10.074

02:02.800 --> 02:04.120
There is no word?

02:05.560 --> 02:09.360
Anthony and Richard have ridden
north to test support for Warwick.

02:09.360 --> 02:12.760
They may just be captured and meet
the same fate as John and Father.

02:12.760 --> 02:15.640
Please, Elizabeth, don't even
say that! How can I help it?

02:15.640 --> 02:17.760
Mad King Henry
is safe and in comfort

02:17.760 --> 02:19.240
but what are they doing to Edward?

02:19.240 --> 02:21.920
What are they doing to him,
right now, Mother, as I stand here?

02:21.920 --> 02:23.600
I need him back with me.

02:23.600 --> 02:25.240
(Sssh...sssh... I know.)

02:28.240 --> 02:31.560
"Advise me", Warwick?!

02:31.560 --> 02:33.720
Not lock me up or take away
my throne,

02:33.720 --> 02:36.800
but, no, you would "advise me"?!
Edward, the council feels...

02:36.800 --> 02:38.760
No, it doesn't!

02:38.760 --> 02:41.720
The council feels nothing
but what you tell it,

02:41.720 --> 02:43.760
and you will turn them against me!

02:43.760 --> 02:47.360
Edward, all we ask is that you
take back your old advisors

02:47.360 --> 02:50.040
and dismiss the Rivers family.
Which you know I will never do!

02:50.040 --> 02:52.960
So, the game is that you make
demands on me

02:52.960 --> 02:56.960
you know I cannot agree to, and use
that as your excuse to keep me here

02:56.960 --> 02:59.080
while George rules in my place!

03:01.000 --> 03:04.080
But really, you rule through him.

03:04.080 --> 03:06.400
Edward! The loyalty
that we had to...

03:06.400 --> 03:09.240
No! I am "Your Grace" to you,
cousin!

03:09.240 --> 03:12.400
The Lord's anointed king
and ruler of this kingdom!

03:12.400 --> 03:15.600
And Your Grace needs to understand
that this is a betrayal

03:15.600 --> 03:18.680
and that the Queen's family...
Are loyal to me!

03:18.680 --> 03:22.360
Which is more than can
be said for you and George.

03:22.360 --> 03:25.120
Now, where is the Queen

03:25.120 --> 03:28.160
because if you have harmed
a single hair upon her head...

03:28.160 --> 03:30.600
She would have likely sent
the Devil down upon me!

03:30.600 --> 03:33.080
But she is barricaded in the Tower.

03:33.080 --> 03:36.160
Now that, dear cousin,

03:36.160 --> 03:37.840
is treason!

03:47.240 --> 03:49.120
As is this.

03:50.560 --> 03:53.560
But, if I must hold court
at Warwick Castle,

03:53.560 --> 03:56.800
then you may bring me some venison
and some small ale

03:56.800 --> 03:59.680
so I may eat at your expense
as I run my kingdom!

03:59.680 --> 04:02.480
Is that clear to you?

04:02.480 --> 04:04.040
Ssh...

04:04.040 --> 04:07.160
Yes, and bring me brother George
as I have words to say to him.

04:10.600 --> 04:13.120
Ah! Brother George's
new wife, Isabel,

04:13.120 --> 04:16.120
married without my consent.
(Would you get them in there?)

04:16.120 --> 04:18.279
I do hope you're not expecting
loyalty from him!

04:18.279 --> 04:21.399
Will you get them in there! Go, go!

04:26.640 --> 04:27.920
She's not bled yet?

04:27.920 --> 04:29.640
She's with child.

04:29.640 --> 04:32.880
A wedding night child
shows we have God's blessing.

04:32.880 --> 04:35.560
Is it a boy?
I... How would I know, Father?

04:37.000 --> 04:39.320
I have called a Parliament at York

04:39.320 --> 04:42.640
where we will proclaim George
the king and Isabel his queen.

04:42.640 --> 04:45.640
But, Father! I cannot! Be quiet,
Isabel! It may as well be over with.

04:45.640 --> 04:48.440
He knows full well what we're doing.
You cannot turn back now.

04:48.440 --> 04:51.400
You must stay your course
come hell or glory.

04:51.400 --> 04:53.840
But Parliament will never agree!
They must!

04:55.360 --> 04:57.200
The Rivers woman is so hated.

04:57.200 --> 04:59.200
She has pushed aside your father

04:59.200 --> 05:01.480
and every other noble advisor
England ever had.

05:01.480 --> 05:05.360
And in their place, put scum. You
will not question me. Now get out!

05:09.280 --> 05:13.440
(You may question him when you
are queen... You may do then!)

05:13.440 --> 05:15.160
Husband?

05:17.600 --> 05:20.440
I have word from Jasper Tudor!

05:20.440 --> 05:22.880
Jasper says that Parliament
is sitting at York

05:22.880 --> 05:25.200
and they will decide what
to do with Edward!

05:25.200 --> 05:27.640
They should just cut his head off.

05:27.640 --> 05:31.200
Is that what you'd do, Margaret?
Take a man's life so readily? Hmm?

05:31.200 --> 05:34.560
He has gone against his rightful
king and God. My Lord. Thank you.

05:34.560 --> 05:36.360
I would do it myself
if I were a man.

05:36.360 --> 05:39.320
I would do it myself anyway,
as Joan of Arc would have done.

05:39.320 --> 05:42.320
Perhaps we should be grateful that
it's not your choice to make.

05:42.320 --> 05:45.040
It is not I who choose it,
but the Lord.

05:45.040 --> 05:47.240
He tells me of his will
and I carry out his work.

05:47.240 --> 05:49.520
He has ruled Edward
should lose the throne,

05:49.520 --> 05:52.240
and soon, he will reveal
the way my son shall come upon it.

05:52.240 --> 05:53.640
Or rather, you will decree

05:53.640 --> 05:56.160
whatever action that you take
to be God's will!

05:57.960 --> 06:01.440
Jasper understands all of this.
I did not imagine that you would!

06:01.440 --> 06:05.160
Ah, yes, Jasper Tudor.

06:05.160 --> 06:08.160
Does he share your blood-lust too,
Margaret?

06:08.160 --> 06:11.240
Would he lop off the head of
a king ordained by God?

06:11.240 --> 06:14.120
Jasper and I are one in all things.

06:14.120 --> 06:17.360
No, not all, Margaret.
You're not married to Jasper Tudor.

06:17.360 --> 06:18.600
You are married to me.

06:31.360 --> 06:32.560
George!

06:32.560 --> 06:35.640
You coward! Come and face
me like a man!

06:35.640 --> 06:38.960
Don't hide behind our cousin,
George!

06:38.960 --> 06:42.640
Does our mother know about this?!
Damn you, Edward!

06:42.640 --> 06:44.920
I'll not allow that witch
upon the throne,

06:44.920 --> 06:48.360
and you've been no king since you
first dipped your wick in her!

06:48.360 --> 06:51.080
George?
Off to Parliament, Warwick,

06:51.080 --> 06:53.640
to try and force the crown
on George's head?!

07:06.520 --> 07:09.680
Issy!
Look what they have sent for you!

07:09.680 --> 07:12.720
It is her coronation furs.
Elizabeth's!

07:12.720 --> 07:15.760
They have taken them
from the Palace of Westminster!

07:21.040 --> 07:22.920
They still smell of her perfume.

07:24.440 --> 07:26.720
Only kings and queens
may wear this fur!

07:28.520 --> 07:30.440
You shall be queen, Issy.

07:30.440 --> 07:32.400
Aren't you happy?!

07:34.280 --> 07:37.040
Father has done this for you,
Isabel.

07:37.040 --> 07:39.800
If he had done it for me,
I'd be the happiest girl in England.

07:39.800 --> 07:42.320
There are two queens already, Annie.

07:42.320 --> 07:46.000
One is in exile the other
is cowering in the Tower

07:46.000 --> 07:49.600
with a price upon her head.
I would be the third queen.

07:51.120 --> 07:54.640
So, what if Father turns against us
as he's done both the others?!

07:54.640 --> 07:57.560
He will not turn against you.

07:57.560 --> 08:00.640
You are carrying the prince,
his grandson.

08:02.960 --> 08:05.200
There is no-one else for Father now.

08:05.200 --> 08:07.640
We all said that Edward
was the rightful king.

08:07.640 --> 08:10.240
We said that he
was the Flower of York

08:10.240 --> 08:13.680
and we would walk in the sweet
garden of England with him.

08:13.680 --> 08:16.600
We danced at her coronation.
We said that we loved her.

08:16.600 --> 08:19.720
You and I never said that, Issy,

08:19.720 --> 08:21.320
we did not like her.

08:21.320 --> 08:23.160
Not ever.

08:23.160 --> 08:27.320
Father says we must think of her
as our enemy and so we must.

08:31.360 --> 08:34.159
Look how beautiful this is.

08:34.159 --> 08:37.840
Remember when we used
to play at being queen?

08:39.480 --> 08:43.799
Well, you can be queen in real life.
I don't want to be queen, Annie.

08:47.080 --> 08:50.880
I thought that this marriage
was for me. But it's not.

08:50.880 --> 08:52.880
It's all for them.

08:53.920 --> 08:57.040
We are their pieces
on a board, Annie.

08:58.040 --> 09:00.880
And marriage is a wretched thing.

09:00.880 --> 09:02.640
It's not like it is for her.

09:04.320 --> 09:06.280
We'll never be who she is.

09:07.640 --> 09:10.040
We'll never have what she has.

09:13.800 --> 09:17.080
My Lords!
Parliament is called to order.

09:23.880 --> 09:27.600
..I shall be a strong leader.
The whole country behind me...

09:57.960 --> 10:01.280
..To turn against your own brother.
The throne has the rightful king.

10:07.160 --> 10:10.320
No crown, George?

10:10.320 --> 10:13.320
You clearly couldn't
command Parliament.

10:14.560 --> 10:18.040
So, you must let me go,
or you must kill me.

10:19.520 --> 10:21.800
Because there is no other
end to this.

10:24.440 --> 10:26.440
George... George!

10:50.680 --> 10:52.480
Take it off!

10:53.600 --> 10:56.200
I SAID, "TAKE IT OFF"!

11:05.800 --> 11:10.280
George will not be king.
Parliament would not agree.

11:10.280 --> 11:13.080
Your father has risked everything,
and he has lost.

11:14.680 --> 11:16.360
He has lost.

11:44.000 --> 11:45.640
(Elizabeth!)

11:57.080 --> 11:59.720
Welcome home. King Edward!
King Edward!

11:59.720 --> 12:00.880
They lost their nerve.

12:00.880 --> 12:04.080
George said he would behead me,
but of course, he would not dare.

12:04.080 --> 12:06.240
Not even Warwick has
the stomach for that!

12:06.240 --> 12:08.880
He thought I was still that boy
that he could control.

12:08.880 --> 12:11.960
He tried to make me give you up
but I told him

12:11.960 --> 12:14.680
that I would happily stay
in his house for ever,

12:14.680 --> 12:17.040
but never would
I give up my wife nor who I am.

12:17.040 --> 12:20.200
They are fools to think it.
So, he just released you?

12:20.200 --> 12:22.960
Parliament wouldn't declare
for George and make him king,

12:22.960 --> 12:25.760
so if Edward wouldn't abdicate
and they wouldn't kill him...

12:25.760 --> 12:29.200
Warwick let me out for exercise,
so he could save his pride.

12:29.200 --> 12:31.360
But really, he just let him go.

12:31.360 --> 12:32.960
And now he will be sorry.

12:34.560 --> 12:37.800
You know about my brother John,
and Father?

12:42.960 --> 12:45.880
So, they will pay for it.

12:45.880 --> 12:47.640
You won't like it, but they won't.

12:49.360 --> 12:51.800
We must have peace, Elizabeth.

12:51.800 --> 12:54.920
And I was a fool not to see
that I had shut Lord Warwick out.

12:54.920 --> 12:56.720
But he knows that he has lost

12:56.720 --> 12:59.960
and he will beg for my forgiveness
as will George.

12:59.960 --> 13:03.120
You must not give it! I will.

13:05.240 --> 13:06.920
They are my brother and my cousin.

13:06.920 --> 13:09.040
And this country cannot
stand another war,

13:09.040 --> 13:10.880
especially one within this family.

13:14.240 --> 13:16.920
And I will make Warwick's nephew
Duke of Bedford.

13:18.520 --> 13:21.280
My first husband's title?

13:21.280 --> 13:25.280
He's Warwick's heir and I must give
him some stake in staying loyal.

13:25.280 --> 13:27.200
He is a traitor.

13:27.200 --> 13:30.640
I don't care what his nephew gets,
as long as you execute Warwick!

13:30.640 --> 13:33.560
I can't, my love. And I won't.

13:33.560 --> 13:37.480
And what is more, I will
give our daughter, Elizabeth,

13:37.480 --> 13:41.280
to young Bedford in marriage
to make that alliance firm.

13:41.280 --> 13:43.880
Over my dead body!

13:43.880 --> 13:46.600
We must. For then even Warwick
will have a chance of his blood

13:46.600 --> 13:49.520
being on the throne one day and
he will not come against me again.

13:49.520 --> 13:53.880
I swear to you that she will never
marry Warwick's nephew.

13:53.880 --> 13:56.880
Then forgive me for being worried
out of my wits about you

13:56.880 --> 13:58.400
and trying to keep you safe!

13:58.400 --> 13:59.920
But they would have murdered YOU.

13:59.920 --> 14:02.960
So while I am King of England,
I shall give my daughter in marriage

14:02.960 --> 14:07.200
to anybody I please, and no-one,
including you, shall stop me!

14:11.280 --> 14:14.200
(Our Father, who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name.

14:14.200 --> 14:17.960
(Thy kingdom come, thy will be done,
on earth as it is in heaven...)

14:24.400 --> 14:26.480
I am no longer the King's Sheriff.

14:28.640 --> 14:32.120
And I've been passed over
for my family title by him.

14:32.120 --> 14:36.560
Yes, that's right, the King is free.

14:36.560 --> 14:39.200
And he regrets to inform me

14:39.200 --> 14:41.560
that you and Jasper Tudor wrote
to his brother George

14:41.560 --> 14:43.400
and offered your support.

14:43.400 --> 14:46.920
So my younger brother John
becomes the Earl of Wiltshire

14:46.920 --> 14:48.760
which should have come to me.

14:51.760 --> 14:54.880
For all your hopes of greatness,
you have hurt only yourself

14:54.880 --> 14:57.280
and you will only ever be
Lady Stafford.

14:59.240 --> 15:01.600
I hope that you're happy.

15:05.200 --> 15:06.960
You will write no more letters.

15:06.960 --> 15:09.880
You will write to no-one at all.
Especially Jasper Tudor.

15:09.880 --> 15:12.880
And if I find that you have
I shall take away your books,

15:12.880 --> 15:16.920
your freedoms and your visits to
your son. Is that clear, Margaret?

15:19.120 --> 15:21.160
IS IT CLEAR?!

15:56.280 --> 15:58.360
They're coming here for Christmas?

16:00.160 --> 16:02.400
We're not even out of mourning!

16:05.920 --> 16:07.600
I do not want to be here.

16:10.440 --> 16:12.960
She will know
that I have worn her furs

16:12.960 --> 16:15.120
and she will put her Evil Eye
upon us.

16:15.120 --> 16:17.840
She'll not care about us
any more, Issy.

16:17.840 --> 16:21.960
She will still hate us.
Because of Father.

16:24.120 --> 16:26.600
Maybe with them close to us

16:26.600 --> 16:28.920
our curse can do its work.

16:29.880 --> 16:32.000
I'll make them my ladies-in-waiting.

16:46.280 --> 16:48.080
Welcome to court.

16:50.280 --> 16:52.120
Warwick.

16:52.120 --> 16:53.720
George.

16:56.920 --> 16:58.760
The prodigals return.

17:35.600 --> 17:37.120
Your Grace...

17:43.040 --> 17:44.240
Lady Rivers.

17:47.920 --> 17:49.400
I am sorry for your loss.

17:49.400 --> 17:53.120
By which you mean
the brutal slaying of my father

17:53.120 --> 17:56.800
and my brother who were innocent
of any crime in all their lives

17:56.800 --> 17:59.360
and merely obedient to their Lord
and king?

17:59.360 --> 18:01.160
In the fortunes of war...

18:01.160 --> 18:03.280
It was NOT war.

18:03.280 --> 18:06.800
This was no honourable death
on a battlefield.

18:06.800 --> 18:07.920
It was murder.

18:07.920 --> 18:11.160
And it was treason
in the eyes of God and man.

18:11.160 --> 18:12.840
Your Grace.... Be quiet.

18:18.040 --> 18:20.320
Your Grace, I must return
to my Lord and husband...

18:20.320 --> 18:24.080
You will go whenever I command it,
Countess Warwick.

18:24.080 --> 18:27.120
And all of you will dance
to whatever tune I sing.

19:07.840 --> 19:12.840
Would you like to dance, dear
sister? No, thank you, Anthony.

19:20.960 --> 19:23.880
Anthony's been talking
about his trip to Italy...

19:46.080 --> 19:48.200
I can't...

19:52.960 --> 19:54.680
Your Grace.

19:54.680 --> 19:56.480
You shouldn't even be here!

19:56.480 --> 19:57.920
Thomas!

20:01.240 --> 20:03.240
Ah, such passion(!)

20:03.240 --> 20:06.960
I am only glad that he and his
brother were not with my father

20:06.960 --> 20:08.400
to be butchered by your axe.

20:08.400 --> 20:11.680
So am I! That would have
been too awful for you.

20:11.680 --> 20:16.480
I know that you do not like me
and that you plot against the king.

20:16.480 --> 20:21.320
And while he may forgive you,
I promise I NEVER will.

20:21.320 --> 20:23.000
Never.

20:23.000 --> 20:24.240
Lord Warwick.

20:24.240 --> 20:27.360
My aunt, Duchess Cecily.
Season's greetings.

20:27.360 --> 20:29.880
Another one of us returned to court!

20:29.880 --> 20:32.800
My dear son, George, invited me,

20:32.800 --> 20:35.400
to share his joy
that he is soon to have an heir.

20:36.880 --> 20:40.520
Seems the force that had me
exiled from the court

20:40.520 --> 20:43.480
has lost its power
and Edward is a man again.

20:43.480 --> 20:46.800
He has always been a man.

20:48.960 --> 20:51.360
But it seems that that is not enough

20:51.360 --> 20:54.080
to win the loyalty of those
who are supposed to love him.

21:02.800 --> 21:04.200
Sister.

21:11.640 --> 21:14.080
More land for the traitors?

21:14.080 --> 21:17.160
I wonder that it does not
make you sick.

21:17.160 --> 21:21.160
For the nobles, my love,
and this is what it is to be king.

21:21.160 --> 21:23.040
I give out wealth and favours

21:23.040 --> 21:25.800
or else they may wish that good
old Henry was back on the throne,

21:25.800 --> 21:27.880
or his son, Edward,

21:27.880 --> 21:29.680
or my brother, George.

21:29.680 --> 21:32.160
Or, God forbid, Margaret
Beaufort's son, Henry Tudor,

21:32.160 --> 21:35.320
"Let's have Lancaster back!"
She surely cannot hope for him?

21:35.320 --> 21:37.680
There are too many others
in line before him!

21:39.120 --> 21:42.600
Ah, Warwick! There you are!
I have something for you.

21:58.200 --> 22:00.720
So, how are our newlyweds, hmm?

22:00.720 --> 22:04.040
Is your daughter mad with love
for my troublesome brother George?

22:05.600 --> 22:09.000
They give thanks that God has
blessed them with a child so soon.

22:11.440 --> 22:13.440
They have hopes it may be a boy.

22:15.160 --> 22:17.080
We all pray for sons.

22:35.000 --> 22:37.400
I have to have a son.

22:46.240 --> 22:48.040
Choose.

22:48.040 --> 22:50.120
Choose which one you will draw in.

22:53.720 --> 22:54.960
This one.

22:54.960 --> 22:56.960
Are you sure?

22:56.960 --> 22:58.600
Yes.

22:58.600 --> 23:00.240
Very well then...

23:02.960 --> 23:04.440
Draw it in.

23:04.440 --> 23:06.120
See what you have chosen.

23:15.880 --> 23:17.400
It's a baby's spoon!

23:17.400 --> 23:19.080
Turn it over.

23:24.720 --> 23:26.280
"Edward"!

23:27.400 --> 23:32.480
Oh, Mother! I'm going
to have a boy named Edward!

23:50.440 --> 23:52.160
Come to bed, my love.

24:27.200 --> 24:30.000
Mmm, something's made you
very hungry!

24:32.560 --> 24:33.840
You will wait.

24:37.000 --> 24:38.440
Unlace my dress.

24:48.320 --> 24:49.520
Hurry up.

25:59.720 --> 26:01.800
Ah...

26:01.800 --> 26:05.080
You see how Edward forgives
me anything?

26:05.080 --> 26:08.760
I cannot bear it, Father.
She is too awful to me!

26:08.760 --> 26:12.160
Do not fret, my little moth.

26:14.120 --> 26:16.480
You shall have your moment
in the light.

26:16.480 --> 26:18.240
We are close to the throne...

26:20.160 --> 26:22.440
(But soon, we shall
be closer still.)

26:24.400 --> 26:26.400
A marriage for me?

26:26.400 --> 26:29.160
Richard? No. Not Richard.

26:30.880 --> 26:33.240
He is heart and soul for the King.

26:38.480 --> 26:40.720
Do your duty.

26:40.720 --> 26:42.800
Never forget who you are,

26:42.800 --> 26:45.480
and the great name that you bear.

26:47.240 --> 26:49.400
For a while, we must all
suffer hardship

26:49.400 --> 26:51.800
but it will all be worth it,

26:51.800 --> 26:54.720
for we will have
what we are owed and Edward...

26:58.120 --> 27:00.000
..will never betray me again.

27:21.400 --> 27:22.880
My Lady?

27:24.920 --> 27:27.080
What do you mean,
"another uprising"?

27:27.080 --> 27:29.320
In favour of witless old Henry.

27:29.320 --> 27:31.520
With a leader
who will not announce his name.

27:31.520 --> 27:33.880
A leader with no name? I do not see.

27:33.880 --> 27:35.840
He may be a herald
to Margaret of Anjou,

27:35.840 --> 27:39.280
testing how much support she can
raise before she lands her troops

27:39.280 --> 27:42.640
to free her husband,
so I will make quick work of him.

27:42.640 --> 27:44.160
Can someone else not lead the army?

27:44.160 --> 27:46.440
No, it is my crown.
I must defend it.

27:46.440 --> 27:49.640
I must put my neck on the line
with the men who love me.

27:49.640 --> 27:52.160
Edward, please, don't go.

27:52.160 --> 27:53.680
I'm with child again.

27:54.920 --> 27:58.000
And this time I'm SURE it's a boy.

28:00.160 --> 28:04.360
Oh, I knew it! That's the best news
you could give me!

28:04.360 --> 28:05.960
How are you so sure it's a boy?

28:05.960 --> 28:08.280
Would you pry into
a woman's mysteries?

28:08.280 --> 28:11.280
No, I would not.

28:11.280 --> 28:15.240
Then, please, stay.
This time, to protect us both?

28:15.240 --> 28:18.040
It is all the more reason
I must defend my crown

28:18.040 --> 28:20.600
for my son to inherit.

28:20.600 --> 28:23.240
My prince...

28:23.240 --> 28:25.120
we will call Edward.

28:26.560 --> 28:28.640
Edward.

28:30.480 --> 28:33.240
What about your faithful cousin
Warwick and loyal George?

28:33.240 --> 28:34.720
Will they ride with you?

28:34.720 --> 28:36.560
Hah! My little queen of mistrust,

28:36.560 --> 28:39.200
Warwick is in the north
raising men for me as we speak.

28:39.200 --> 28:42.440
And George will be by my side.
In body perhaps, but not in spirit.

28:42.440 --> 28:45.760
They have promised me their loyalty,
Elizabeth. Truly you must trust me.

28:45.760 --> 28:48.120
I will be home with you by
May Day morning

28:48.120 --> 28:51.880
with peaches and salt cod,
for you and my prince, Edward.

29:09.400 --> 29:11.200
Annie, feel! He's excited.

29:11.200 --> 29:13.640
He is strong! Or she is.

29:23.640 --> 29:28.520
Father, what is it?
A rebellion. Against the King.

29:42.880 --> 29:46.840
Jasper! Jasper!

29:50.080 --> 29:52.680
My Lady Margaret.

29:52.680 --> 29:55.000
You haven't written.

29:55.000 --> 29:58.400
My husband has forbidden me.
What is it?

29:58.400 --> 30:02.520
There is an uprising.
Our time has come at last!

30:08.600 --> 30:10.400
Queen Margaret is sailing?

30:10.400 --> 30:14.480
She is in Calais and will sail once
Edward is engaged in battle.

30:14.480 --> 30:18.560
Oxford brings 10,000 men from
the south, and I have half of Wales.

30:18.560 --> 30:22.280
So, you must arm your tenants
and go. The tide is turning.

30:22.280 --> 30:24.080
It is our moment.

30:26.560 --> 30:29.280
I won't ride out.

30:29.280 --> 30:32.040
And I shall send no-one. What?

30:32.040 --> 30:34.600
These wars have taken too
many men already.

30:34.600 --> 30:36.880
I've lost a brother
and a father to this cause,

30:36.880 --> 30:39.520
and still, it is not won.
I, too, have lost my kinsmen...

30:39.520 --> 30:41.440
and that is exactly
why we must fight on,

30:41.440 --> 30:43.400
so that their sacrifice
is not for nothing.

30:43.400 --> 30:46.640
If we rise up now as one,
we can unseat this York usurper

30:46.640 --> 30:48.760
and return the throne to Lancaster!

30:48.760 --> 30:51.240
Until the next time.
And the next time.

30:52.360 --> 30:55.000
Does King Henry even know that
this war is being fought?!

30:55.000 --> 30:57.080
He barely even knows his name.

31:02.200 --> 31:04.040
And Edward is the better king.

31:04.040 --> 31:07.760
The roads are safe, the nobles'
private armies are disbanded

31:07.760 --> 31:11.120
and brigands have been brought
to justice.
Perhaps that is what matters.

31:11.120 --> 31:14.480
What matters is God's rightful
king upon the throne!

31:14.480 --> 31:17.240
Or do you abandon the Lord
as well as your House?

31:17.240 --> 31:19.880
Oh, no!
Edward is also anointed by God.

31:19.880 --> 31:22.320
So, how should we know which one
to pick?!

31:22.320 --> 31:25.560
Perhaps God is confused
and doesn't know himself?

31:25.560 --> 31:29.080
And now you blaspheme and blame
almighty God for your own shame!?

31:29.080 --> 31:34.320
You are a coward and you fear
for your own neck like a child!

31:34.320 --> 31:38.440
And I ask God, every day, why
I must be married to such a man!

31:38.440 --> 31:42.400
Enough, Margaret! Enough!
No. No, it is not enough!

31:43.560 --> 31:45.360
It is not!

31:45.360 --> 31:48.880
How can I live
with such bitter shame?

31:51.800 --> 31:53.400
I am sorry for you.

31:53.400 --> 31:55.720
He has no backbone and no loyalty.

31:55.720 --> 31:58.120
We will defeat them without him.

31:58.120 --> 32:01.440
I only wish I could ride
with you and fight myself.

32:01.440 --> 32:03.840
You have the courage of any man.

32:03.840 --> 32:06.080
You're a soldier.

32:09.480 --> 32:11.720
Margaret.

32:11.720 --> 32:14.680
The uprising is not called
by Margaret of Anjou.

32:15.800 --> 32:19.600
It is stirred by Warwick
and George, Duke of Clarence.

32:19.600 --> 32:21.760
What do you mean?

32:21.760 --> 32:24.720
George has written that he will
return your son his title,

32:24.720 --> 32:27.640
if we bring men to the field
to fight Edward.

32:27.640 --> 32:32.440
It's a trick to lure Edward
into battle. Once he is engaged,

32:32.440 --> 32:36.000
Warwick and George will turn
their armies on him and kill him.

32:36.000 --> 32:39.000
They need us there
to work the deception.

32:39.000 --> 32:42.280
That's why I need Stafford's men.
They'll put George on the throne?!

32:42.280 --> 32:44.840
Yes, but George is weak and greedy

32:44.840 --> 32:46.920
and men will quickly tire of him.

32:46.920 --> 32:49.640
When they do, they will turn
to Lancaster.

32:51.360 --> 32:54.440
Then we'll make
a chance for your boy.

32:57.200 --> 33:00.480
I will go to my brother, Welles, and
ask him to raise an army for you.

33:00.480 --> 33:02.920
He will do it
if he thinks it is for Lancaster.

33:03.920 --> 33:06.680
Jasper, take this...

33:09.840 --> 33:12.760
..and know that...I'm with you.

33:37.880 --> 33:41.160
Oh, no, Mother, no!

33:41.160 --> 33:44.200
I don't want to be the queen!

33:44.200 --> 33:46.360
I only want my baby!

33:46.360 --> 33:48.160
Why must Father do it?

33:53.160 --> 33:57.080
I do not know why he must.
He is possessed with it.

33:57.080 --> 34:01.240
He risks his life and fortune
and the safety of all four of us.

34:01.240 --> 34:03.480
He says that Edward is not
a king for England.

34:03.480 --> 34:06.040
He's only for the Rivers family.
Oh, Mother! No!

34:06.040 --> 34:08.159
He says that he did not fight
this long

34:08.159 --> 34:11.920
to put Edward's cat's-paw
of a wife upon the throne.

34:11.920 --> 34:14.320
Stop bleating, Isabel! Be quiet.

34:17.480 --> 34:19.560
We must support him.

34:19.560 --> 34:21.880
We must, all of us, stand with him

34:21.880 --> 34:24.360
and just pray to God
he is successful in this venture.

34:25.760 --> 34:27.440
God help us all if he is not.

34:39.320 --> 34:40.600
My Lord.

34:42.199 --> 34:43.960
I owe you an apology.

34:43.960 --> 34:47.920
I spoke to you very wrongly today.
I beg your forgiveness.

34:49.239 --> 34:51.320
What did you give Jasper Tudor?

34:54.440 --> 34:56.199
A necklace.

34:59.400 --> 35:01.680
He gave it to me when
I left Pembroke.

35:01.680 --> 35:04.040
I should not have kept
a trinket from another man.

35:05.680 --> 35:10.200
God has given me a sign that I must
be a good and loyal wife to you.

35:11.320 --> 35:13.400
I wish to make amends.

35:16.160 --> 35:18.160
And to my mother, also.

35:50.120 --> 35:52.600
Will you take me to see my mother?

35:54.760 --> 35:56.840
So I may show contrition?

35:58.080 --> 35:59.600
Very well.

36:45.280 --> 36:48.760
To what do I owe SUCH an honour?

36:50.960 --> 36:52.120
Mwah.

36:52.120 --> 36:54.280
Welles!

36:54.280 --> 36:55.920
Margaret. Lord Stafford.

36:55.920 --> 36:58.680
Richard, will you pray with me?

37:03.280 --> 37:05.680
Richard, I have something
to tell you.

37:05.680 --> 37:07.240
Something wonderful.

37:08.840 --> 37:13.760
God has commanded the nobles
of England to fight his holy war,

37:13.760 --> 37:16.240
to strike down this pretender,
Edward,

37:16.240 --> 37:19.120
who took the throne from his
own righteous king, Henry.

37:24.360 --> 37:26.240
Richard, God has spoken to me...

37:28.200 --> 37:29.680
..of you!

37:32.080 --> 37:35.480
Yes, Richard, you are special,
and you are to do God's work.

37:39.920 --> 37:44.280
What would he have me do?
You are to lead his blessed crusade.

37:46.280 --> 37:47.880
You are to summon the army

37:47.880 --> 37:51.200
that will cast this wicked Edward
from God's throne.

37:53.000 --> 37:57.200
But I have...not ever...
fought in battle!

37:57.200 --> 37:59.840
I do not even know...

37:59.840 --> 38:02.520
Sssh...sssh...sssh...sssh...

38:02.520 --> 38:05.120
All you must do is bring the army.
God will do the rest.

38:05.120 --> 38:08.600
When he does, he will place a new
Lancastrian king upon the throne,

38:08.600 --> 38:11.200
and where do you think
he will look for that king,

38:11.200 --> 38:14.160
if you have led his House
of Lancaster to victory?

38:20.400 --> 38:22.480
Dear God,

38:22.480 --> 38:26.360
please, watch over Edward
in this battle that is coming.

38:26.360 --> 38:28.960
Strike down Edward's enemies

38:28.960 --> 38:32.560
and keep him safe in your love.

38:35.080 --> 38:39.880
Lord, we pray for our father,
for success in his endeavours.

38:39.880 --> 38:43.400
And that he knows what he is doing
and it is your will.

38:45.160 --> 38:47.760
I pray for my husband.

38:47.760 --> 38:50.240
That he comes home safe to me

38:50.240 --> 38:52.800
and for the safety of my baby.

38:52.800 --> 38:55.840
Bring my Lord Warwick
success against his enemies.

38:55.840 --> 38:59.080
Almighty God, strike down Edward
of York in this battle.

39:00.840 --> 39:04.600
Strike down this wicked usurper who
has taken the rightful king's crown.

39:06.960 --> 39:09.880
Bring victory to my brother
and to Jasper Tudor,

39:09.880 --> 39:11.960
who fight for you on the side
of Lancaster.

39:15.520 --> 39:17.200
Please, God, let Edward win.

39:20.240 --> 39:21.720
Let him live.

39:21.720 --> 39:23.480
Please, God, let Edward lose.

39:23.480 --> 39:25.240
Let him die.

39:35.680 --> 39:38.120
Let us hope it is as easy
as they promise.

39:38.120 --> 39:39.600
"Easy"?

39:41.320 --> 39:44.480
Warwick and the Duke of Clarence
will turn on Edward

39:44.480 --> 39:47.040
and kill him in the battle.

39:47.040 --> 39:50.400
We are just here to lure him
to the field.

39:50.400 --> 39:51.720
But... My sister said...

39:53.640 --> 39:56.720
But why would Warwick and the Duke
of Clarence be on our side?

39:56.720 --> 39:59.000
Oh, believe me, they're not!

39:59.000 --> 40:01.640
They will make George the king
if all this goes well.

40:04.400 --> 40:06.240
But... And if it does not...

40:08.120 --> 40:11.240
..then we will all die
a traitor's death

40:11.240 --> 40:14.520
and have our guts spread
outside Westminster.

40:14.520 --> 40:18.200
But... I thought this was God's holy
war to return Lancaster to victory?

40:18.200 --> 40:19.520
Get some sleep.

40:20.880 --> 40:22.960
Your part's nearly over.

40:35.680 --> 40:37.160
God is not to save me?

40:44.760 --> 40:47.320
'God is not to save me?
Is not to save me...'

41:04.960 --> 41:07.600
In the King's name, stop! Guards!

41:08.840 --> 41:10.880
I need to see the King!

41:10.880 --> 41:12.040
Please!

41:21.480 --> 41:23.520
Edward! There is a plot to kill you.

41:23.520 --> 41:25.840
It is Warwick
and the Duke of Clarence!

41:25.840 --> 41:27.760
They mean to turn on you
in the battle.

41:27.760 --> 41:29.720
Please, Edward...

41:31.280 --> 41:33.040
Traitor...

41:58.720 --> 42:01.680
No! No!

42:01.680 --> 42:04.360
No! No, not my boy!

42:07.920 --> 42:11.600
My boy is dead! Lady Beauchamp?
My boy is dead!

42:11.600 --> 42:14.600
Lady Beauchamp, I'm so sorry...
Why did he go?! Why did he go?!

42:14.600 --> 42:19.000
Why did he do it? My boy is dead...

42:19.000 --> 42:21.840
They failed, then?
Edward is not dead?

42:21.840 --> 42:25.800
Go inside.
I'm sorry. I don't understand.

42:25.800 --> 42:28.120
How could God allow this?

42:28.120 --> 42:31.760
Why...why...why did he...

42:38.480 --> 42:42.040
Edward is safe, but it was
all a trap as I feared!

42:42.040 --> 42:45.000
Warwick and George have fled and
Edward is in pursuit.

42:45.000 --> 42:47.520
He knows they would
have murdered him in cold blood!

42:47.520 --> 42:50.440
He murdered Welles who'd only come
to tell him of a plot against him.

42:50.440 --> 42:54.040
He is no longer the Golden Boy of
York. No-one will trust him again.

42:54.040 --> 42:56.600
What should he care? He should care,

42:56.600 --> 42:59.040
because now the Beaufort family
is in mourning

42:59.040 --> 43:02.760
for their kinsman, Welles. Edward
has given his enemies a new cause.

43:02.760 --> 43:05.280
Oh, Richard! My darling boy...

43:05.280 --> 43:09.520
He was a traitor. He betrayed his
House of Lancaster to Edward.

43:09.520 --> 43:13.320
For goodness' sake, Margaret,
the boy is dead.

43:13.320 --> 43:17.040
She does not care, she has no heart!
And she is cursed!

43:17.040 --> 43:19.560
It seems to me it is YOU
who is cursed, Mother,

43:19.560 --> 43:23.200
for you gave birth to a traitor.
Enough, Margaret! That is enough.

43:36.320 --> 43:38.080
Jasper! Jasper's fled!

43:38.080 --> 43:41.560
The King will hunt him down and kill
him, so he's fled to France.

43:41.560 --> 43:43.840
We have to fetch Henry!

43:43.840 --> 43:46.120
As soon as it is safe to do so.

43:46.120 --> 43:48.560
No, no...
Jasper bids me fetch him now.

43:48.560 --> 43:51.000
Jasper's judgment is not the best,

43:51.000 --> 43:53.960
as perhaps you can now see,
since his cause is lost.

43:53.960 --> 43:57.680
He's running for his life to France,
leaving little Henry
with no guardian.

43:57.680 --> 44:01.480
He has no choice! He chose to fight
the King. This is the outcome.

44:07.600 --> 44:09.000
I will fetch the boy.

44:09.000 --> 44:12.600
I will come too.
He is my son. I am not afraid.

44:12.600 --> 44:15.400
I will do as you say
if there are soldiers on the road.

44:15.400 --> 44:18.000
I beg you. I beg you. Please.

44:18.000 --> 44:20.600
Very well, Margaret.

44:20.600 --> 44:23.600
Perhaps now you'll understand
your mother's grief.

44:32.680 --> 44:34.600
I have a pain.

44:35.960 --> 44:38.560
Every time he moves or turns.

44:38.560 --> 44:40.440
I cannot breathe.

44:46.720 --> 44:47.960
Issy!

44:49.400 --> 44:51.080
Father?!

44:51.080 --> 44:53.040
We failed!

44:53.040 --> 44:56.360
We did not "fail", we retreated!

44:56.360 --> 44:59.760
Our error was to trust in Lancaster,
the Beaufort boy betrayed us.

44:59.760 --> 45:02.240
The rightful king is George of York!

45:02.240 --> 45:05.840
And we shall see him anointed
on the throne! God save King George!

45:07.080 --> 45:09.000
King George!

45:09.000 --> 45:11.360
Now, we'll sail to Calais
and raise an army.

45:11.360 --> 45:14.320
We are at war with so-called
"King Edward".

45:14.320 --> 45:16.560
Father, I cannot sail!

45:16.560 --> 45:18.000
I am in my confinement...

45:20.280 --> 45:21.360
Father?!

45:21.360 --> 45:24.600
Warwick and George
are sailing for Calais

45:24.600 --> 45:27.160
and they will bring
the English Garrison against us!

45:27.160 --> 45:29.800
Anthony has ridden to try and stop
them but he may not be in time.

45:29.800 --> 45:32.080
We must act, Mother. Elizabeth.

45:32.080 --> 45:36.280
They killed your husband and your
son. And they have gone unpunished!

46:57.640 --> 46:58.960
We were discovered!

46:58.960 --> 47:01.200
Anthony Rivers rode like a madman

47:01.200 --> 47:03.120
and captured
our fleet at Southampton.

47:03.120 --> 47:06.760
I'll have his head for that!
We sail for Calais! Now!

47:10.360 --> 47:12.880
Midnight knows
there's something wrong.

47:12.880 --> 47:16.400
Don't be silly, Issy.
He's just being naughty.

47:16.400 --> 47:18.120
He doesn't want to go.

47:18.120 --> 47:21.680
Edward is after us! Get on board!
Issy is afraid, Father.

47:21.680 --> 47:23.200
Come on!

47:25.040 --> 47:27.520
See... He's on board now.

47:27.520 --> 47:30.680
You can sleep and we'll be there
in no time, you'll see.

47:36.880 --> 47:39.520
There's a storm brewing.

47:39.520 --> 47:43.080
And if it gets any worse,
we'll have to stop.

47:57.840 --> 48:01.600
Look how we have the best cabin!
We were never allowed it before.

48:01.600 --> 48:05.000
The wind's picking up.

48:05.000 --> 48:07.520
It's just a few big waves, Issy.

48:07.520 --> 48:11.600
WAVE CRASHES, WIND HOWLS,

48:11.600 --> 48:14.560
Annie, it's a storm!
We're going to die!

48:14.560 --> 48:17.280
Take down the sail! Reef in!
Aye, Captain!

48:20.720 --> 48:23.600
Annie! Annie!

48:26.280 --> 48:30.000
Annie! The baby's coming!

48:32.080 --> 48:34.240
Annie!

48:39.160 --> 48:41.400
Margaret?! Margaret.

48:41.400 --> 48:43.880
We must take shelter!

48:43.880 --> 48:45.560
We must take shelter!

48:52.200 --> 48:54.920
Mother! The baby's coming!

48:54.920 --> 48:57.200
We must return to port!

48:57.200 --> 48:59.760
Father says we will run
for the French shore

48:59.760 --> 49:01.680
and take the shelter of the coast.

49:03.000 --> 49:06.440
Get linen for her! Quickly!

49:19.000 --> 49:21.280
You have to light the fire!
My sister is in labour!

49:21.280 --> 49:23.960
It's a witch's wind!
We're cursed with women on board!

49:27.120 --> 49:29.360
I command you to light the fire!

49:29.360 --> 49:32.320
I, Anne Neville,
the Kingmaker's daughter.

49:32.320 --> 49:36.160
What are you doing down here?
Has my son been born?

49:36.160 --> 49:38.640
We need linen, rags! Anything!

49:38.640 --> 49:41.520
And a spoon for Issy to bite on.
In the galley.

49:41.520 --> 49:45.160
And give her this.
God knows she'll need it.

49:54.200 --> 49:56.480
Why have we stopped?

49:56.480 --> 49:59.000
We must make sure the castle
isn't taken. Wait here.

49:59.000 --> 50:01.880
Hup! Hup!

50:03.000 --> 50:05.320
This is too much, Elizabeth.

50:05.320 --> 50:07.720
Once the magic is out,
you cannot call it back,

50:07.720 --> 50:10.040
and it may turn round
and drown us too.

50:17.520 --> 50:19.800
It's just the servants and the boy!

50:31.440 --> 50:33.600
Welcome to Pembroke Castle, my Lady.

50:35.440 --> 50:36.840
Sir.

50:39.480 --> 50:43.160
Where is my Uncle Jasper?
He is with you?

50:43.160 --> 50:45.680
He is safe, but he's not with us,
I'm afraid, Henry.

50:49.440 --> 50:52.680
Will he be back?
I am sure of it.

50:52.680 --> 50:55.160
Henry? I'm...I'm your mother,
I'm Lady Margaret.

50:55.160 --> 50:58.200
I've come to take you home.
I'm safe, thank you, my Lady.

50:58.200 --> 51:01.120
I'm waiting for my Uncle Jasper,
so I cannot leave.

51:01.120 --> 51:03.120
I shall tell the groom
to tend to your horses.

51:03.120 --> 51:06.280
He's seeing to it, so you,
you may stay inside. You...you...

51:09.600 --> 51:11.640
He does not want to come.

51:11.640 --> 51:13.280
He does not know me.

51:15.040 --> 51:17.480
He is Jasper's boy
through and through.

51:21.640 --> 51:24.640
And now, you'll make him yours.

51:30.160 --> 51:33.360
Lady Mother, what is happening?
Why doesn't the baby come?

51:33.360 --> 51:36.320
It's stuck inside her.
She needs a midwife to turn it.

51:36.320 --> 51:38.800
Go ask your father how long
before we reach Calais!

51:45.800 --> 51:48.560
Father? Isabel needs a midwife.

51:48.560 --> 51:52.320
Mother asks how soon we shall be in
Calais? We're sailing into her now.

51:55.160 --> 51:58.680
Isabel shall see the best
physician in France.

51:58.680 --> 52:01.960
What's that noise?

52:01.960 --> 52:06.160
They've raised the harbour chain!
They've stayed loyal to Edward!

52:06.160 --> 52:07.960
Turn the wheel!

52:07.960 --> 52:11.000
Raise the sail! Now! Do it!

52:20.200 --> 52:22.960
Lady Mother, they are firing at us!

52:22.960 --> 52:28.000
You will have to turn it. Annie!
You have the smallest hands. No...

52:28.000 --> 52:31.160
You have to put them inside her
and try and turn the baby.

52:31.160 --> 52:32.840
No, Mother, please! I cannot!

52:32.840 --> 52:36.080
The child is stuck. If you love
your sister, you will do it!

52:36.080 --> 52:39.960
Annie... Please, Lady Mother!
I don't want to die!

52:39.960 --> 52:42.600
Annie! Ann...

52:46.960 --> 52:48.760
(Jasper!)

52:52.000 --> 52:53.440
Jasper!

52:59.240 --> 53:00.680
I'm sorry!

53:00.680 --> 53:02.280
No! No, no... It's me.

53:02.280 --> 53:05.000
I'm so sorry.
My brother betrayed you.

53:05.000 --> 53:07.120
Margaret,

53:07.120 --> 53:08.800
I have to go.

53:10.320 --> 53:13.120
There is a price upon my head
and they're searching for me.

53:14.400 --> 53:16.080
I will go to France,

53:16.080 --> 53:19.560
but I will be back and with an army.

53:19.560 --> 53:24.520
I couldn't tell our boy that
I was here in case he spoke of it,

53:24.520 --> 53:27.720
but I was hiding there
in the hills, waiting for you.

53:29.400 --> 53:32.920
You wanted to be sure my boy
was safe before you sailed.

53:37.240 --> 53:39.280
How will I live without you?

53:47.400 --> 53:49.720
May we come and watch you go?

53:49.720 --> 53:52.520
It will be good for the boy
to see you safely off.

53:54.040 --> 53:55.280
He is close to you.

55:06.520 --> 55:07.800
It was a boy.

55:10.920 --> 55:12.160
A baby boy.

55:29.400 --> 55:33.400
I have to go away. You must live
with your mother now, boy.

55:33.400 --> 55:36.280
You must keep her safe for me.
All right?

55:39.160 --> 55:41.960
Like a Tudor, eh, Henry?

55:43.000 --> 55:44.840
Like a Tudor, sir!

55:57.880 --> 55:59.240
Come here, boy.

56:39.960 --> 56:42.200
Henry, would you like to
pray with me?

56:42.200 --> 56:45.280
We could pray for your Uncle Jasper
together? No, thank you, my Lady.

56:45.280 --> 56:48.120
It's "Mother", Henry.
I'm your La...Lady Mother...

56:59.320 --> 57:01.080
Edward!

57:07.200 --> 57:08.560
Come.

57:14.240 --> 57:15.760
You remembered!

57:15.760 --> 57:21.200
Peaches and salt cod.
Back for May Day as promised.

57:21.200 --> 57:25.480
And now we have our York prince,
Edward, we shall be safe.

57:42.200 --> 57:44.440
I'm sorry for your loss.

57:45.640 --> 57:47.480
OUR loss.

57:50.800 --> 57:52.280
There will be others.

57:53.600 --> 57:57.400
If we had stayed at Warwick Castle,
my baby would have lived.
