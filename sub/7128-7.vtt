WEBVTT

00:00.470 --> 00:03.290
Come on, frank. Old movie,
popcorn--it'll be fun.

00:03.300 --> 00:07.430
ElI, I can't help but notice, we--we seem to
be spending a lot of time together lately and--

00:07.440 --> 00:09.380
are you breaking up with me?

00:09.390 --> 00:11.140
- Look, if you're lonely...
- I'm not lonely.

00:11.150 --> 00:13.670
I have this patient--
fun, great personality...

00:13.680 --> 00:16.790
hey, if I wanted to spend
three hours having a long,

00:16.820 --> 00:18.940
uncomfortable conversation
full of awkward pauses,

00:18.950 --> 00:21.400
I'd go out for a meal with my mother.

00:21.410 --> 00:22.760
What's she seeing you for anyway?

00:22.770 --> 00:25.430
- Acupuncturist/client privilege, dude.
- Come on.

00:25.440 --> 00:28.330
She's trying to quit smoking. Did
I mention she's almost a nonsmoker?

00:28.340 --> 00:29.110
I'm not interested.

00:29.120 --> 00:30.290
Maybe just give her a call.

00:30.300 --> 00:32.870
* Help, I need somebody *

00:32.880 --> 00:36.380
patti? * Help, not just anybody *

00:36.390 --> 00:42.110
* help, you know I need someone help *

00:42.950 --> 00:48.920
* when I was younger so
much younger than today *

00:48.930 --> 00:54.370
* I never needed
anybody's helpin any way *

00:54.380 --> 00:57.350
* but now these days are gone *

00:57.360 --> 01:00.660
* I'm not so self-assured *

01:00.670 --> 01:03.170
* now I find I've changed my mind *

01:03.180 --> 01:05.980
* I've opened up the doors *

01:05.990 --> 01:11.530
* help me if you can I'm feeling down *

01:11.540 --> 01:17.700
* and I do appreciate you being 'round *

01:17.710 --> 01:22.730
* help me get my feet
back on the ground *

01:22.740 --> 01:31.470
* won't you please please help me?*

01:34.250 --> 01:37.840
Eli, she's innocent.

01:37.850 --> 01:40.540
Who's innocent, patti?

01:41.670 --> 01:45.850
- Down in front!
- What?

01:47.130 --> 01:50.220
Yeah, sure thing. I'll tell him.

01:50.230 --> 01:53.690
- The next joint?
- Yeah, sure.

01:54.300 --> 01:55.500
patti, where are you?

01:55.510 --> 01:57.160
I've been trying you all morning.

01:57.170 --> 01:58.440
Don't worry. Everything's fine.

01:58.450 --> 02:00.470
I just--I-I wanted
to ask you something.

02:00.480 --> 02:03.420
I see you're not at your desk.

02:03.430 --> 02:07.860
This is gonna sound peculiar, but I was
wondering if maybe you needed my help.

02:07.870 --> 02:11.440
Hold on. Slow down. What? Come on.

02:11.450 --> 02:14.050
- you're not making any sense.
- Patti. Patti!

02:14.060 --> 02:16.570
well, I'm leaving now.
I'll see you there.

02:18.190 --> 02:20.370
- Is everything all right?
- I'm taking a sick day.

02:20.380 --> 02:22.630
Are you okay? Who were you talking to?

02:22.640 --> 02:24.900
Angela's roommate.

02:24.910 --> 02:26.650
Angela was arrested.

02:26.660 --> 02:28.480
Angela was arrested?

02:28.490 --> 02:31.430
- Another D.U.I.? -
Wh-- another D.U.I.?

02:31.440 --> 02:33.800
Repeat what someone
says one more time...

02:33.810 --> 02:35.980
two weeks ago, angela
got pinched for a D.U.I.

02:36.000 --> 02:37.220
I got it kicked, but apparently...

02:37.230 --> 02:38.320
she got arrested again?

02:38.340 --> 02:39.710
The cops came to her apartment.

02:39.730 --> 02:42.350
They handcuffed her and
dragged her out like a criminal.

02:42.370 --> 02:44.410
Now please, I have got
to get to bryant street.

02:44.420 --> 02:45.530
We're coming with you.

02:45.540 --> 02:47.080
Uh, you asked for my help, so...

02:47.090 --> 02:47.940
no, I didn'T.

02:47.950 --> 02:52.520
Well, obviously you need some help, and you know
two great attorneys who would love to help you,

02:52.530 --> 02:56.650
so we're coming with you, okay? Come on.

02:56.660 --> 02:59.150
Huevos rancheros?

02:59.160 --> 03:02.610
I see your pregnancy cvings have
taken a dramatic turn for the spicy.

03:02.630 --> 03:06.970
Actually, you're the one who was supposed to be eating
them at your breakfast meeting with jorge navarro.

03:06.990 --> 03:07.920
Was that this morning?

03:07.930 --> 03:08.970
Well, now it's tomorrow morning.

03:08.980 --> 03:13.070
Just make sure and mention how painful
it was when your crown fell out.

03:13.090 --> 03:15.580
It's not like you to
forget a meeting, dad.

03:15.590 --> 03:17.740
These days I'm burning
my candle at both ends.

03:17.760 --> 03:20.640
Between a full day of depositions
and financial meetings,

03:20.650 --> 03:25.010
I must put in an appearance at
the osterhagen benefit luncheon.

03:25.400 --> 03:29.650
Could I interest you in a
half-baked speech followed by squab?

03:29.660 --> 03:32.580
couldn't interest
ellen in that one, huh?

03:32.590 --> 03:33.630
No, not this time.

03:33.640 --> 03:35.980
Well, you know how I love a good squab,

03:35.990 --> 03:42.220
but matt and I are going to
find out what's going on in here.

03:42.730 --> 03:44.440
Yes, the sonogram.

03:44.450 --> 03:46.160
Are you gonna find out the sex?

03:46.170 --> 03:49.120
It's a little too early to find out
whether you could buy it a baseball mitt.

03:49.140 --> 03:52.150
It's never too early for that.

03:53.860 --> 03:58.460
case number 0-8-1-2-1-9-7-2,
people V. Scott.

04:02.590 --> 04:03.710
What's he doing here?

04:03.730 --> 04:05.630
Helping you, angie. We both are.

04:05.640 --> 04:09.040
Keith bennett and eli stone of wethersby, stone
& associates for the defendant, your honor.

04:09.060 --> 04:10.370
Waive reading, plead not guilty.

04:10.390 --> 04:13.640
Actually, keith, I think u're gonna
want to hear the charges on this.

04:13.650 --> 04:18.110
Defendant is chargedwith three counts each of
felony drug theft and narcotics trafficking.

04:18.130 --> 04:21.850
The defendant stole
fentanyl, a highly addictive

04:21.880 --> 04:26.650
and powerful synthetic opiate from a teaching
hospital where she is a medical student.

04:26.680 --> 04:28.070
Our plea still tands.

04:28.080 --> 04:30.100
Not guilty on all charges.
Move to release on recognizance.

04:30.110 --> 04:35.790
She's charged with six major drug felonies, for
which she faces very significant prison time.

04:35.810 --> 04:37.600
She's not going anywhere.
I'll vouch for that.

04:37.610 --> 04:39.100
Like you vouched last time?

04:39.110 --> 04:43.030
All right, I'm setting bail
at $500,000 cash or bond.

04:43.050 --> 04:44.730
I'll post the bond myself.

04:44.740 --> 04:46.010
very sporting of you, mr. Stone.

04:46.020 --> 04:47.720
She's innocent, judge.

04:47.750 --> 04:50.150
Save it for your closing.

04:59.330 --> 05:03.450
*****I am not a drug trafficker.

05:03.470 --> 05:06.210
We believe you, angela.

05:08.760 --> 05:09.880
Mom?

05:09.890 --> 05:13.110
Yes, of course, sweetheart.

05:13.120 --> 05:14.530
Why do they think you stole the drugs?

05:14.540 --> 05:16.090
I don't know. It's all lies.

05:16.100 --> 05:18.120
So you've never been in the drug
supply room at your hospital?

05:18.130 --> 05:20.160
Of course I have. I work at a hospital.

05:20.170 --> 05:23.470
It's what I do every day,
at least a dozen times a day.

05:23.500 --> 05:27.470
Do you remember anything about the
night they say you stole the fentanyl?

05:27.480 --> 05:32.220
I checked out 20 milligram-prednisone
tablets for S.Henderson's arthritis,

05:32.230 --> 05:36.880
100 micrograms of levothyroxine
for mr. Flynn's thyroid condition,

05:36.900 --> 05:41.240
and 600 milligrams of l-dopa
for mr. Zachry's parkinson'S.

05:41.260 --> 05:45.310
Those are some pretty specific memories for something
you do every day, at least a dozen times a day.

05:45.320 --> 05:48.390
Gee, keith, maybe a good memory's
one of the reasons I'm a student

05:48.400 --> 05:50.590
at one of the top medical
schools in the country.

05:50.610 --> 05:53.240
It's true. She has a
memory like an elephant.

05:53.250 --> 05:57.120
So the school suspended and investigated
you, the police arrested you,

05:57.140 --> 06:00.060
the D.A.'S prosecuting
you-- all for no reason?

06:00.070 --> 06:02.860
I don't know what their reason is.

06:02.870 --> 06:04.520
I just know I'm not guilty.

06:04.540 --> 06:07.640
It's not your job to figure
out what their case here is.

06:07.660 --> 06:10.270
It's ours.

06:13.120 --> 06:15.820
taylor, hi. Congratulations.

06:15.830 --> 06:17.240
Thanks, dr. Lenz.

06:17.250 --> 06:20.290
And you must be...

06:20.300 --> 06:21.870
who are you?

06:21.880 --> 06:24.060
- A friend.
- Uh, boyfriend.

06:25.010 --> 06:28.160
Our relationship's sort of undefined.

06:28.170 --> 06:31.730
Uh, basically I'm the guy not important
enough to leave on the intake form.

06:31.760 --> 06:33.890
Well, he's the biological father.

06:35.920 --> 06:39.710
- That makes you plenty important.
- Thank you.

06:40.240 --> 06:42.550
ready to see your baby?

06:42.560 --> 06:45.020
Should I turn away if you
guys want to look down...

06:45.500 --> 06:47.660
right.

06:56.240 --> 06:57.760
oh, my god.

06:57.780 --> 07:01.680
See there? That's your baby's heart.

07:02.190 --> 07:04.460
That's unbelievable.

07:04.470 --> 07:07.340
Everything looks perfect.

07:08.350 --> 07:11.360
you two done good.

07:20.200 --> 07:22.200
- perfect timing.
- You wanted to see me, paul?

07:22.210 --> 07:24.910
Maggie dekker, meet ashley cardiff.

07:24.930 --> 07:26.210
Nice to meet you.

07:26.580 --> 07:29.250
As you know, cardiff refineries is
one of our firm's biggest clients.

07:29.270 --> 07:30.990
That's my father and grandfather.

07:31.010 --> 07:35.420
They're the ones who live to crack open the
earth like a piÃ‘ata and steal all its candy.

07:35.430 --> 07:37.610
But ashley doesn't have
the same family sweet tooth,

07:37.620 --> 07:41.250
since she has asked us to set up a
charitable trust for arctic wildlife

07:41.260 --> 07:42.780
damaged by her family's pipeline.

07:42.810 --> 07:46.330
Well, not every woman likes to eat
moose burgers and shoot polar bears.

07:46.340 --> 07:48.740
No. Good for you.

07:48.750 --> 07:51.880
- Paul, could I talk to you for a second?
- Yeah.

07:51.890 --> 07:53.780
Excuse us.

07:55.820 --> 07:58.300
When mr. Posner and ms.Klein
brought me to this firm

07:58.310 --> 08:00.300
and put me in charge of
the pro bono department,

08:00.320 --> 08:02.920
they agreed that I could
prioritize my own cases.

08:02.930 --> 08:04.660
Is it possible we're
sleeping together, ms.Dekker,

08:04.660 --> 08:07.190
- and I don't know it?
- No.

08:07.190 --> 08:10.450
So why would you think I care very
much about what you like or dislike?

08:10.470 --> 08:11.500
I am the assigning partner.

08:11.520 --> 08:15.100
You will do this, and yowill
do this to the best of your...

08:15.110 --> 08:18.850
well, whatever ability
mr. Posner sees in you.

08:19.760 --> 08:21.330
This job sucks.

08:21.350 --> 08:24.080
Cardiff refineries treats the
environment like a port-a-potty,

08:24.140 --> 08:27.520
and now i have to help daughter
warbucks buy her way to a conscience.

08:27.530 --> 08:29.460
I mean, what is it about the
rich that makes them think

08:29.480 --> 08:31.920
that they can just buy their
way into being good people?

08:31.940 --> 08:33.340
Probably the tons of money.

08:33.370 --> 08:35.390
You notice whenever the
press writes about her,

08:35.409 --> 08:37.610
they call her the
"heiress" ashley cardiff?

08:37.620 --> 08:41.539
That's what she does.
That's--that's her job. heiress.

08:43.100 --> 08:45.980
You didn't hear a word of that just now.

08:45.990 --> 08:48.220
Taylor and I went to the doctor today.

08:48.230 --> 08:49.250
Is the baby all right?

08:49.260 --> 08:52.400
Yeah. Yeah. Seeing
the little heart go...

08:53.390 --> 08:54.580
it's really in there.

08:54.600 --> 08:56.330
That's a good day, matt.

08:56.340 --> 08:59.470
Yeah, it should have bee it was...

08:59.500 --> 09:01.050
really strange.

09:01.060 --> 09:02.390
Whatever the hell taylor and I are,

09:02.410 --> 09:05.710
it would have been nice to know before
going in for something like that.

09:05.730 --> 09:08.700
It couldn't have been
more uncomfortable.

09:08.710 --> 09:12.250
Maybe it would help if
you... defined things.

09:12.260 --> 09:14.150
I asked her to marry me.

09:14.170 --> 09:15.750
Don't worry. She said no.

09:15.760 --> 09:18.140
I was trying to do the right thing.

09:18.160 --> 09:20.930
She doesn't need you to
do the right thing, spike.

09:20.950 --> 09:23.260
She just wants you to love her.

09:23.270 --> 09:24.720
That's all any woman wants, really.

09:24.730 --> 09:26.450
That hasn't been my experience.

09:26.470 --> 09:30.260
But I do have the feelings for her.

09:30.270 --> 09:33.810
And in the sense that you've
said the words "I love you"?

09:33.820 --> 09:35.210
Not in so many words...

09:35.220 --> 09:38.350
particularly, those specific words.

09:38.370 --> 09:40.330
Matt, she's having your baby.

09:40.360 --> 09:43.600
Don't you think that she might want
to hear the actual three little words?

09:43.610 --> 09:48.790
Yeah, I know, it's just, those
actual three little words are... big.

09:48.800 --> 09:50.340
You're gonna be a father, matt.

09:50.350 --> 09:53.400
It's all big from here on out.

09:53.610 --> 09:55.220
all right, let's get back to work.

09:55.240 --> 09:57.880
I've told you and eli everything I know.

09:57.890 --> 10:01.270
I'll tell you when you've
told us everything you know.

10:02.120 --> 10:06.630
So did you tell my mom about how you think I
was doing cocaine the night I was pulled over?

10:06.640 --> 10:09.490
All right, for the record, it wasn't
me who suspected you of doing coke.

10:09.500 --> 10:10.620
It was in your bloodorK.

10:10.630 --> 10:14.070
and, no, I didn't tell
patti. Attorney/client.

10:14.080 --> 10:17.370
Plus, what she knows about
you... isn't my business.

10:17.380 --> 10:18.200
Did you tell eli?

10:18.210 --> 10:19.870
What he knows about u
is very much my business.

10:19.880 --> 10:23.470
Did you also tell him that the test
results returned a false positive?

10:23.480 --> 10:25.150
I told him that's what you told me.

10:25.160 --> 10:26.530
- He even believed it.
- It's theruth!

10:26.540 --> 10:30.910
Yeah, well, your denials carried a lot more weight
before you got popped for possession with intent.

10:31.450 --> 10:34.550
So you do think I'm guilty.

10:34.750 --> 10:37.060
I worked ten plus years in
the public defender's office.

10:37.070 --> 10:42.440
Most of my clients were guilty as charged, but not
one of 'em ever got anything less than my "a" game.

10:43.000 --> 10:45.130
well, aren't you a big man?

10:45.140 --> 10:47.910
- I didn't say I was--
- I'm not finished.

10:47.920 --> 10:51.530
I want you to believe in
me, not some principle.

10:51.540 --> 10:55.800
And if you can't do that,
well, then you can go to hell.

11:01.760 --> 11:03.600
I saw you yawn.

11:03.610 --> 11:06.250
There should be no yawning
on my daughter's case.

11:06.260 --> 11:07.560
Ah, don't worry.

11:07.570 --> 11:11.250
I yawned because I'm tired,
not because I'm bored.

11:12.900 --> 11:15.330
How are things looking?

11:15.340 --> 11:17.680
Good.

11:17.990 --> 11:20.050
Shaky.

11:20.060 --> 11:23.100
The D.A.-- Um, she
can make this case.

11:23.110 --> 11:26.510
I-I've seen people go to
jail on a lot weaker evidence.

11:27.050 --> 11:30.900
But their case has holes,
and I'll make them wider.

11:30.910 --> 11:32.630
okay.

11:32.640 --> 11:34.010
How are you holding up?

11:35.220 --> 11:37.720
I went to church...

11:37.730 --> 11:40.910
this morning to pray for angela.

11:40.920 --> 11:44.140
My girl is my reason for being.

11:44.160 --> 11:48.790
Everything in my life has
been for her life, and, um...

11:51.740 --> 11:56.210
now they're saying she's
a junkie, and, um... thief.

12:00.900 --> 12:02.420
I want to believe her.

12:02.430 --> 12:03.710
We're gonna get through this, patti.

12:03.720 --> 12:07.670
Oh, I'm not crying because of that.

12:08.940 --> 12:12.000
I got the message.

12:12.020 --> 12:13.520
What message were you talking about?

12:13.530 --> 12:16.420
From you.

12:16.710 --> 12:20.560
The voice mail asking
me if I needed help

12:20.570 --> 12:23.490
before I found out that
angela was arrested.

12:23.520 --> 12:27.560
You knew I needed help before I did.

12:27.570 --> 12:30.850
Did you get a message, too?

12:30.860 --> 12:35.600
Like-- like with the earthquake
or when you saved jordan?

12:36.230 --> 12:38.730
yeah.

12:39.920 --> 12:42.730
And it told you
to--to help angela?

12:42.750 --> 12:46.020
Not just that, patti, it...

12:46.520 --> 12:51.280
told me... that angela is innocent.

12:53.170 --> 12:55.360
- she is?
- She is.

12:57.110 --> 13:01.490
well, then you get to
work and do as you're told.

13:01.500 --> 13:03.460
Yes, ma'am.

13:08.970 --> 13:14.280
*******Are stored in
automated pyxis machines,

13:14.290 --> 13:16.850
which require a
fingerprint I.D. To open.

13:16.860 --> 13:21.530
Access to the machine and each individual
drug are automatically recorded in a log.

13:21.550 --> 13:26.390
I imagine that the drug the defendant
is charged with stealing-- fentanyl--

13:26.410 --> 13:30.350
is accessed routinely by
many doctors in your hospital.

13:30.370 --> 13:35.640
Yes, but miss scott was the only one
to withdraw fentanyl without a M.A.R.

13:35.680 --> 13:37.300
A medical administration record.

13:37.340 --> 13:38.940
Which means what?

13:38.960 --> 13:42.520
She wasn't accessing the
drug for a specific patient.

13:42.560 --> 13:46.180
Is that the only reason you
had to suspend miss scott?

13:46.210 --> 13:52.190
Angela's behavior had become increasingly
erratic, her grades were in decline,

13:52.220 --> 13:55.150
and she was persistently
stressed and moody.

13:55.170 --> 13:59.540
These are classic signs
of drug dependency.

14:03.420 --> 14:07.710
Angela scott is the only person in
yourntire hospital who is stressed and moody?

14:07.730 --> 14:10.390
It sounds like disneyland is in danger
of losing its distinction of being

14:10.400 --> 14:11.850
"the happiest place on earth."

14:11.860 --> 14:13.130
object to the sarcasm.

14:13.140 --> 14:15.670
I'm sorry, your honor.
I was going for ridicule.

14:15.680 --> 14:20.140
Is it your testimony that angela scott
was the only doctor seen removing fentyl

14:20.150 --> 14:22.450
from the pyxis machine on
the three nights in question?

14:22.460 --> 14:26.620
In point of fact, no one actually
witnessed the fentanyl being removed

14:26.630 --> 14:29.790
sounds like an ironclad case.

14:29.800 --> 14:32.800
That was sarcasm, your honor.

14:33.550 --> 14:35.600
your next witness, miss jarrells.

14:35.610 --> 14:39.300
- The people call S.F.P.D.Officer
jerome sawyer-- - objection.

14:39.310 --> 14:43.860
officer sawyer recently arrested the defendant on
suspicion of driving under the influence of alcohol.

14:43.870 --> 14:45.650
- Objection.
- Move to strike. Move for a mistrial.

14:45.660 --> 14:48.620
Evidence of prior bad acts is
not even remotely admissible.

14:48.630 --> 14:50.430
it is, to establish motive.

14:50.440 --> 14:54.420
We believe that the defendant
traded the fentanyl for cocaine,

14:54.440 --> 14:56.700
which was indicated in
the D.U.I. Blood test.

14:56.710 --> 14:58.740
- Your honor...
- she's saying this crap in front of the jury, your honor.

14:58.750 --> 15:00.000
Move for a mistrial.

15:00.010 --> 15:02.180
I can't do that, mr. Bennett,
because the A.D.A.Is right on this.

15:02.190 --> 15:06.660
The prior charge and the blood test go
to motive and are therefore admissible.

15:08.780 --> 15:11.940
are you doing cocaine?

15:17.510 --> 15:19.940
the night of my D.U.I.

15:19.950 --> 15:24.480
There was a party after
exams, and someone had coke.

15:24.980 --> 15:27.150
I had never tried it before. I know.

15:27.160 --> 15:28.920
I know it was a mistake.

15:28.930 --> 15:31.180
And getting behind the wheel of
a car-- that was another mistake.

15:31.190 --> 15:33.930
I am so sorry, eli.

15:33.940 --> 15:38.620
I know how disappointing this all is,
but it--it was just one time, one night.

15:38.630 --> 15:43.910
It's not who I am, and it doesn't mean
I stole those drugs, which I didn'T.

15:43.930 --> 15:46.590
Please, don't give up on me. Please?

15:46.600 --> 15:48.530
I-I know you didn't do this,

15:48.540 --> 15:51.050
but I also know that
we're gonna lose this trial

15:51.060 --> 15:55.340
unless you stop fighting
us and start fighting back.

15:58.680 --> 16:00.180
Sean binR.

16:00.200 --> 16:01.950
That--that's who
gave me the coke.

16:01.960 --> 16:03.880
Would he have had
access to the fentanyl?

16:03.900 --> 16:06.810
Yes, definitely.

16:08.030 --> 16:10.830
I'll bring h in for a chat.

16:14.590 --> 16:16.960
you don't like me, do you?

16:17.310 --> 16:19.680
At? No. No.

16:19.690 --> 16:24.250
Well, I mean, we--we just met,
but no, you seem... lovely.

16:24.960 --> 16:29.730
Dad said he liked this firm because there
were good lawyers who were good liars.

16:31.170 --> 16:33.560
I'm used to people not
liking me, miss dekker.

16:33.570 --> 16:36.950
um, excuse me. I have
to take this. Hello?

16:36.960 --> 16:42.650
Wealthy heiress, life of leisure, a
father who's been ravaging the environment,

16:42.660 --> 16:47.380
and now she's trying to buy a conscience
by giving away some of her ill-gotten gains.

16:47.400 --> 16:50.560
Truth be told, I
wouldn't like me either.

16:52.220 --> 16:53.790
Sorry.

16:53.800 --> 16:54.830
good news?

16:54.840 --> 16:57.070
Oh, it's just. private.

16:57.080 --> 17:01.940
He's been trying to find the perfect moment to
finally tell his pregnant girlfriend he loves her.

17:01.950 --> 17:05.720
It's just, for taylor,
I need to go epic.

17:05.740 --> 17:09.619
I don't member the last time
a guy wanted to go epic for me.

17:09.630 --> 17:14.359
Her favorite singer's in town for a concert,
but it's completely and predictably sold out.

17:14.400 --> 17:16.700
And I've even been bidding
for a pair of tickets on ebay,

17:16.710 --> 17:20.720
but I have a feeling the guy
with the e-mail "sealtixordeath"

17:20.730 --> 17:22.800
isn't gonna let me just
walk away with them.

17:22.810 --> 17:24.960
- Seal--heidi's
husband? - Yeah.

17:24.970 --> 17:27.030
I could call her for you.

17:27.040 --> 17:28.460
- Heidi klum?
- Yeah.

17:28.470 --> 17:30.610
You--you would
do that for me?

17:31.100 --> 17:33.730
Is this one worth it?

17:35.240 --> 17:38.860
Surprisingly, yes.

17:39.260 --> 17:41.680
If there's one thing I've learned,
you can't buy love, but you can,

17:41.700 --> 17:45.380
at the very least, comp house seats.

17:46.690 --> 17:47.860
start liking her.

17:47.870 --> 17:50.310
Heidi, hi.

17:50.320 --> 17:52.830
This is very awkward.

17:52.840 --> 17:57.540
I got a call from ted broden in accounting,
and since we were tightening our belts,

17:57.560 --> 18:02.630
he cautioned me against using the
company credit card to book a hotel room.

18:03.110 --> 18:09.050
I didn't know what he was talking about at first
until I realized he'd called the wrong wethersby.

18:09.060 --> 18:14.830
And you thought I was using firm money to finance a pied
-? terre for extramarital activities.

18:14.840 --> 18:18.130
Honestly, that was only one of
two possibilities I could think of,

18:18.150 --> 18:20.680
and I was sort of hoping there was A...

18:20.690 --> 18:23.860
third better explanation.

18:24.260 --> 18:26.600
I'm sorry, but there isn'T.

18:26.610 --> 18:29.290
I have been living in a hotel of late.

18:29.300 --> 18:30.190
Daddy.

18:30.200 --> 18:35.450
Your stepmother and I came to the
mutual decision to take some time apart.

18:35.460 --> 18:37.150
I'm so sorry, dad.

18:37.160 --> 18:40.750
After my accident, things were
better than they'd been in some time,

18:40.760 --> 18:46.020
as if we both realized we'd been
given a second chance at marital bliss.

18:46.040 --> 18:51.010
But as I've been-- I hope
the word is "evolving"--

18:51.020 --> 18:55.300
ellen and I have...drifted.

18:55.310 --> 18:58.490
Dad, why don't you come
and stay with me tonight?

18:58.530 --> 19:03.500
It should come as no surprise that I'm not
the sort of man to "crash" at anyone's pad,

19:03.510 --> 19:05.570
but thank you for the offer.

19:05.580 --> 19:08.650
Can I at least offer you a hug?

19:08.660 --> 19:12.090
That would be gratefully accepted.

19:16.120 --> 19:16.990
who are you?

19:17.010 --> 19:18.370
His name's mark young.

19:18.380 --> 19:19.890
Nice offices.

19:19.900 --> 19:21.580
- Where's sean binder?
- We don't need sean binder.

19:21.590 --> 19:22.540
Yes, we
do.Angela--

19:22.550 --> 19:26.440
lied, eli, again, as usual.

19:29.370 --> 19:32.330
So what does he have to
do with angela's case?

19:32.520 --> 19:33.470
Tell him.

19:33.480 --> 19:36.430
This is like attorney/client
secrets time, right?

19:36.440 --> 19:38.830
I had to ask all of five people
on campus how to find you.

19:38.840 --> 19:40.950
You think the D.A.Can't or
won't do the exact same thing?

19:40.970 --> 19:44.120
Or should I ring him up right
now, save him the legwork?

19:44.670 --> 19:46.490
I'm ange's dealer.

19:46.500 --> 19:48.510
At least I was till she ran out of bank.

19:48.530 --> 19:51.360
And I was gonna cut her off, but
then she offered something to trade.

19:51.370 --> 19:52.520
The fentanyl.

19:52.530 --> 19:54.100
Yeah, the stuff's like
gold on the street.

19:54.110 --> 19:56.300
Show him.

20:00.000 --> 20:04.400
angela called him a dozen
times last month. Look.

20:09.610 --> 20:12.100
get outta here.

20:15.170 --> 20:16.290
We need to try and plead this.

20:16.310 --> 20:18.680
What if he's covering for
someone else or setting her up?

20:18.690 --> 20:20.790
- What the hell's the matter with you?
- You don't know her, keith.

20:20.800 --> 20:24.570
She's a drug a eliict,.
No one knows her anymore.

20:25.360 --> 20:28.330
I'm not looking to hurt
angela, all right? I like her.

20:28.340 --> 20:30.550
I thought maybe even we...

20:30.570 --> 20:33.210
look, I know you want her not to
have done this, but as her friend,

20:33.220 --> 20:38.100
as her lawyer, you--you can't ignore the
truth just because you wish it wasn't so.

20:38.110 --> 20:40.340
Why do you still believe her?

20:42.420 --> 20:47.650
it was... revealed to me.

20:49.240 --> 20:51.570
Revealed?

20:52.750 --> 20:56.700
Um, I know you believe certain things,
and--and that's-- that's fine...

20:56.730 --> 21:01.370
so long as it doesn't prevent you from
seeg what's right in front of yo face.

21:01.380 --> 21:07.030
Angela's guilty, and if you can't
see that, then we can't help her.

21:14.150 --> 21:15.720
didn't I tell you not
to show up here again

21:15.730 --> 21:18.850
until you callt gi tharl
whose number I gave you?

21:18.860 --> 21:23.370
Well, sorry. I, uh,
had a lot on my plate.

21:24.490 --> 21:27.960
finding out that patti's daughter
is a drug dealer with a coke habit

21:27.970 --> 21:30.990
hasn't really left me much
time for blind dating, so...

21:31.000 --> 21:33.730
well, I'm sorry, eli,
but you're not gonna like

21:33.740 --> 21:37.830
or even understand every
message you're tasked to deliver.

21:38.220 --> 21:40.540
Well, that sucks.

21:40.550 --> 21:42.160
This is gonna destroy patti.

21:42.170 --> 21:46.100
I swore to her that angela
was innocent, but she's not.

21:46.360 --> 21:48.180
How do I deliver that message?

21:48.190 --> 21:50.110
Patti's strong. She'll persevere.

21:50.120 --> 21:52.380
She has family. She has you.

21:52.390 --> 21:55.320
Yeah, I'm not sure how much
good having me is doing anyone.

21:55.350 --> 21:58.820
Anyone who gets close to me
gets kicked in the spiritual ass.

21:58.850 --> 22:00.050
Wait a second.

22:00.070 --> 22:02.070
Is that why you don't want
to go out on this date?

22:02.100 --> 22:04.780
I-I don't need any more
soul-broken people on my conscience.

22:04.800 --> 22:07.190
Eli, you've helped a lot of
people through some hard times.

22:07.210 --> 22:10.970
What, like, uh, taylor? I helped
her by breaking off our engagement.

22:10.980 --> 22:14.750
Or maybe you meant maggie, who I helped
out of her engagement and the firm.

22:14.810 --> 22:16.910
Or grace, who I helped
out of the country.

22:16.920 --> 22:22.420
You think any of those people think that they're
better off for the full and total eli stone experience?

22:22.460 --> 22:23.940
I do.

22:23.950 --> 22:28.500
Your journey as a prophet is gonna bring
you closer to people, not further from them.

22:28.510 --> 22:29.540
It's about connecting.

22:29.570 --> 22:32.910
I've always been connected to patti.

22:32.920 --> 22:36.280
She hasn't just recently
believed in eli the prophet.

22:36.300 --> 22:40.610
She has ways
believed in just eli--

22:40.620 --> 22:45.050
elI the lawyer, eli the jerk,
eli, the friend who is family.

22:47.320 --> 22:49.910
I violated her trust.

22:54.710 --> 22:56.710
I still can't believe
you got these tickets.

22:56.720 --> 22:59.910
Well, stone's not the only
one who can perform miracles.

22:59.920 --> 23:04.500
besides, I know a guy who
knows a guy who knows seal.

23:04.510 --> 23:07.410
- It's the best gift.
- Thank you. Yeah.

23:07.420 --> 23:10.320
Well, you're most welcome.

23:10.330 --> 23:13.250
I wanted tonight to be special.

23:13.270 --> 23:15.130
And why is that?

23:15.140 --> 23:17.520
To tell you...

23:17.530 --> 23:19.860
every night with you is special.

23:19.880 --> 23:23.240
Careful. That almost sound sensitive.

23:25.310 --> 23:31.010
I know this thing of ours hasn't
unfolded in t recommended... order.

23:32.150 --> 23:34.330
We've skipped some beats.

23:34.350 --> 23:40.870
Pole-vaulted over beats, actually, but,
um, just because it's happened quickly...

23:42.470 --> 23:46.460
doesn't mean it hasn't happened.

23:49.920 --> 23:52.730
I love you, taylor.

23:54.240 --> 23:56.960
ladies and gentlemen, seal.

24:01.710 --> 24:06.730
* I was born by the river *

24:07.440 --> 24:10.010
* in a little tent  *

24:10.020 --> 24:15.500
* and oh, just like that
river,I've been running *

24:15.820 --> 24:22.170
* ever since it's been a long *

24:22.180 --> 24:27.110
* long time comin' but I know *

24:27.790 --> 24:30.140
* a change is gon' come *

24:30.150 --> 24:33.270
* whoa, yes, it will *

24:34.180 --> 24:38.400
* it's been too hard livin' *

24:38.410 --> 24:43.520
* but I'm afraid to die *

24:43.530 --> 24:47.890
* 'cause I don't know what's up there *

24:47.900 --> 24:50.340
* beyond the sky *

24:50.350 --> 24:54.240
* it's been a long *

24:54.250 --> 24:59.490
* long time comin' but I know *

24:59.910 --> 25:04.350

25:05.010 --> 25:10.760
* I know a change is gon' come *

25:10.770 --> 25:16.590
* I said I know *

25:19.530 --> 25:22.240
* a change is gonna come *

25:22.250 --> 25:23.880
what do you want me to say, matt?

25:23.890 --> 25:27.780
Uh, I don't know. I guess I was expecting--
call this crazy-- an "I love you, too."

25:27.790 --> 25:29.990
That's usually how this goes.

25:30.010 --> 25:33.670
It does when the other
person feels it, but I...

25:34.060 --> 25:38.570
I just don't know if I do, and I-I don't
think it's fair to say those words-- even--

25:38.580 --> 25:42.110
even with your child
inside me-- if...

25:42.120 --> 25:44.820
they're not what I feel.

25:46.720 --> 25:49.510
You're the dude.

25:49.520 --> 25:50.910
What?

25:50.920 --> 25:56.260
A hot pregnant dude, sure, but in
our relationship, you're the dude.

25:56.270 --> 25:57.990
Okay, I don't--I don't know
what that's supposed to mean.

25:58.010 --> 26:02.690
I'm actually the mature one
here, whicis another first for me.

26:02.700 --> 26:05.410
But it's you...

26:05.440 --> 26:08.060
you're the one who's afraid
to share her feelings.

26:08.070 --> 26:11.230
U're the one who keeps pushing me away.

26:11.240 --> 26:15.860
Well, surprise, surprise, I'm
in touch with my feminine side.

26:15.870 --> 26:20.100
Maybe you should get in touch with
yours. Hope you liked the concert.

26:20.650 --> 26:21.300
Matt.

26:21.310 --> 26:22.990
what's with the face?

26:23.000 --> 26:26.300
The faces? Who died?

26:28.370 --> 26:30.810
Does this have anything
to do with angela?

26:30.820 --> 26:34.580
Patti, uh, I made a mistake.

26:34.590 --> 26:36.790
- Angela is
not-- - no.

26:36.800 --> 26:38.520
Uh, she stole the
drugs from the hospital.

26:38.530 --> 26:39.150
No!

26:39.160 --> 26:43.860
She gave them to a dealer named
mark young to clear up a drug debt.

26:43.870 --> 26:46.000
Your daughter has a
substance abuse problem.

26:46.020 --> 26:49.320
That's not possible, eli. You told me...

26:49.330 --> 26:52.310
- you said he told
you-- - I'm sorry, patti.

26:52.320 --> 26:54.330
You know, I-I love angie.

26:54.340 --> 26:55.850
I didn't want to believe it either.

26:55.870 --> 26:58.090
Believe what?

26:58.530 --> 27:02.240
You look me in the eye, and you
tell me the truth, so help you god!

27:02.250 --> 27:04.120
Am I on the witness stand now?

27:04.130 --> 27:05.520
Did you talk to sean binder?

27:05.530 --> 27:08.310
- He's the one
who-- - stop lying!

27:08.320 --> 27:14.620
Now you need help, baby, but
first, you need to stop lying.

27:20.130 --> 27:22.550
Okay, mom.

27:22.580 --> 27:25.380
Your daughter's a drug addict.

27:25.410 --> 27:27.920
She loves getting high.

27:27.950 --> 27:31.470
This is not you.
This--this isn't you.

27:31.480 --> 27:33.860
How would you know, mom?

27:33.890 --> 27:36.550
You don't know anything about me.

27:36.560 --> 27:42.090
All you ever saw was what you
wanted me to be, needed me to be.

27:42.120 --> 27:46.480
god, the pressure you
put on me to be perfect!

27:46.500 --> 27:49.440
"I'm not raising ordinaryidS."

27:49.450 --> 27:53.930
Like you're so special.
You're a damn secretary.

27:55.090 --> 27:59.930
yes, I'm a secretary
who worked my ass off,

27:59.940 --> 28:03.540
taking crap year after
year, weekends, nights

28:03.550 --> 28:06.970
so you could get opportunities
I never even dreamed of.

28:07.000 --> 28:08.380
I didn't ask for any of it!

28:08.390 --> 28:10.800
You didn't have to ask
for it. I'm your mother.

28:10.810 --> 28:13.420
I didn't ask for that either!

28:24.670 --> 28:29.120
if you were halfthe
mother you think you are...

28:30.030 --> 28:33.750
you would know how unhappy I am. How...

28:33.760 --> 28:38.120
how unhappy I've been for a long time.

28:39.160 --> 28:43.000
But you didn't want to see it...

28:43.340 --> 28:47.150
because of your own problem, mom.

28:49.100 --> 28:53.580
I guess this apple didn't
fall far from t tree.

29:05.150 --> 29:07.690
Patti...

29:09.830 --> 29:13.010
what'd she mean by...

29:15.810 --> 29:19.910
she meant both of us
never needed you more

29:19.920 --> 29:25.360
and were never more wrong
to put our faith in you.

29:31.800 --> 29:33.220
elI.

29:34.440 --> 29:36.690
I thought I was the only one here.

29:36.700 --> 29:38.470
you're here late.

29:38.490 --> 29:44.280
I prefer the office to be empty before I
indulge in my obsession with internet backgammon.

29:44.570 --> 29:47.640
And why are you burning
the midnight oil?

29:48.380 --> 29:49.910
Patti.

29:49.920 --> 29:53.180
I've been trying her all night,
and she doesn't pick up or won'T.

29:53.200 --> 29:55.480
She has your home number, I'm sure.

29:57.540 --> 30:00.190
Used to think that
nothing could get to her.

30:00.210 --> 30:04.130
But today, she was... she was gotten to.

30:06.820 --> 30:11.220
I'm not in the habit of
breaking confidences, eli,

30:11.230 --> 30:14.760
but you know I love
patti as much as you do.

30:14.770 --> 30:20.110
And given the manner and magnitude
of her daughter's troubles,

30:20.120 --> 30:23.150
you should know something.

30:23.870 --> 30:26.820
- She has a problem, too?
- Yes.

30:26.830 --> 30:28.970
Alcohol was her particular vice.

30:28.990 --> 30:31.880
"Was"--you mean,
uh, past tense?

30:31.910 --> 30:32.930
To my knowledge.

30:32.950 --> 30:37.750
His was years ago, before you joined
the firm, back when she was my secretary.

30:37.760 --> 30:42.390
Her work hadeteriorated,
when she even came to work.

30:42.400 --> 30:45.500
One afternoon, I received a
phone call from a local bar.

30:45.520 --> 30:49.130
Patti had overstayed her welcome.

30:49.140 --> 30:52.380
I went down there and
found her inebriated.

30:52.400 --> 30:55.410
I told her she had to
get help, or I'd fire her.

30:55.440 --> 30:57.320
So she got help then?

30:57.350 --> 31:01.760
I believe the term is "dry, not sober."

31:01.770 --> 31:03.370
She just stopped drinking.

31:03.380 --> 31:08.920
And you think that what's
happening with angela has maybe...

31:08.930 --> 31:11.400
pushed her off the wagon?

31:11.420 --> 31:17.360
I think recovery programs give addicts tools
to rely on to get them through difficult times--

31:17.380 --> 31:21.540
tools...patti may not have.

31:22.280 --> 31:25.630
You don't remember the
name of that bar, do you?

31:32.940 --> 31:35.090
why do I get the feeling...

31:35.100 --> 31:37.050
- you're not just going to the gym?
- T away from me, keith.

31:37.060 --> 31:40.110
You gonna send eli the bond
he'll forfeit when you jump bail?

31:40.120 --> 31:43.850
Or how about at least an address so your--your
mom knows which city morgue to collect ydyr bo at?

31:43.860 --> 31:44.970
I'm not going to prison.

31:44.980 --> 31:47.460
You think that's the worst
thing that can happen to you?

31:47.470 --> 31:51.980
Wrong. You take off, things
are only gonna get worse.

31:51.990 --> 31:54.420
W--your
mom's right.

31:54.450 --> 31:56.940
You are not yourself right now.

31:56.950 --> 31:59.900
so tell me, which
angela do you want to be?

31:59.930 --> 32:04.100
The druggiskell who blames her mother for her
mistakes or the woman with brains and--and spirit,

32:04.110 --> 32:06.920
the woman who scored a-a scholarship
to the best med school in the state,

32:06.940 --> 32:10.630
the woman I know can
find her way through this.

32:11.100 --> 32:14.120
Look, all the lies you
told, I never believed you,

32:14.130 --> 32:17.860
but that's not the same
thing as not believing in you.

32:19.570 --> 32:22.110
this is not court, keith, okay?

32:22.130 --> 32:24.360
A pretty speech is not gonna fix this.

32:24.370 --> 32:27.630
No, and you got a lot to fix.

32:27.660 --> 32:30.580
But I know you can.

32:30.610 --> 32:34.700
Just stop... stop
trying to prove me wrong.

32:43.610 --> 32:45.610
what?

32:54.480 --> 32:57.580
- What can I get for ya?
- Her tab.

33:00.670 --> 33:04.870
Well, it's been a long time
since a man bought me a drink.

33:04.900 --> 33:07.660
How gallant.

33:09.170 --> 33:10.990
so...

33:11.000 --> 33:17.360
did jordan open his big mouth, or did god
send a vision I eded a designated driver?

33:17.380 --> 33:20.720
Billy ocean got that
hit about driving a car.

33:20.750 --> 33:23.590
How many times did I talk
to you about my father?

33:23.600 --> 33:25.160
About his drinking problem?

33:25.170 --> 33:26.810
Why did you think I wouldn't understand?

33:26.820 --> 33:29.450
I am not a drunk, eli.

33:29.470 --> 33:33.400
In case you haven't noticed,
I am having a bad week.

33:33.420 --> 33:37.050
I don't need you coming here
uninvited, trying to make me feel worse,

33:37.060 --> 33:39.210
when all I'm doing is trying to
make myself feel a little better.

33:39.220 --> 33:42.310
So how's that working out for ya?

33:46.300 --> 33:50.480
- my daughter...
- is in trouble, a world of it.

33:50.490 --> 33:54.190
She has a drug problem,
and she may go to prison.

33:54.200 --> 33:58.890
She needs you now. But... not like this.

33:59.290 --> 34:01.850
She was right, eli.

34:02.920 --> 34:06.200
It's--it's--it's
my fault.

34:06.230 --> 34:08.620
I pushed her too much.

34:08.650 --> 34:11.400
And look at me.

34:11.750 --> 34:16.900
I'm a fraud. I am a fraud.

34:18.170 --> 34:22.460
She must have felt so alone.

34:26.670 --> 34:30.170
I left my baby alone.

34:31.090 --> 34:36.630
This isn't her fault,
none of it. It's mine.

34:36.639 --> 34:41.889
eli... she's innocent.

34:51.280 --> 34:56.340
I've been angry
and--and confused...

34:56.370 --> 34:59.440
real angry.

34:59.450 --> 35:03.170
But I'm not anymore, 'cause...

35:03.200 --> 35:05.550
'cause I get it now.

35:05.560 --> 35:10.520
All the people that I've been asked
to help, all those, uh, strangers...

35:13.880 --> 35:17.100
now I get to help someone that I love.

35:17.800 --> 35:21.890
And I really want to help you, patti.

35:22.130 --> 35:25.640
But you--you
gotta want my help.

35:31.020 --> 35:33.970
probation, following rehab.

35:33.990 --> 35:38.790
2,000 hours community service at the free
medical clinic in the mission district.

35:38.820 --> 35:40.020
But no jail?

35:40.030 --> 35:42.100
No jail.

35:43.500 --> 35:45.100
what about medical school?

35:45.130 --> 35:51.150
Golden state won't take her back, but if angela
really wants to be a doctor, she'll find a way.

35:51.160 --> 35:54.930
How did you manage all this, eli?

35:55.960 --> 36:00.920
When I was a public defender, I represented a
bad guy accused of cutting up his girlfriend.

36:00.940 --> 36:05.050
Jarrells was the D.A. The cops couldn't
find the knife. I got the case tossed.

36:05.060 --> 36:08.450
What does that got to
do with angela's case?

36:08.460 --> 36:14.850
The cops recently received an anonymous
tip with the knife's whereabouts.

36:16.320 --> 36:19.810
The D.A.Was grateful.

36:20.260 --> 36:23.530
- So we accept the terms?
- Yes. Yes.

36:23.540 --> 36:26.910
Thank you... both.

36:30.500 --> 36:33.110
thank you.

36:43.800 --> 36:46.810
I'm so sorry for what I said.

36:46.820 --> 36:48.500
I didn't mean those things.

36:48.530 --> 36:52.660
It's okay... even if you did.

36:52.960 --> 36:56.140
Some of it is true.

37:00.170 --> 37:03.010
I love you, angela...

37:03.040 --> 37:07.320
so much that my teeth hurt sometimes.

37:10.130 --> 37:15.930
okay. You're not a child anymore,
and I cannot fix all of your problems,

37:15.940 --> 37:20.380
especially when I have
some big ones of my own.

37:22.720 --> 37:26.960
So... maybe we help each other.

37:29.140 --> 37:32.300
You were right about
angela... the whole time.

37:32.310 --> 37:34.500
I should have trusted your instincts.

37:34.510 --> 37:38.320
Who could blame you? You know, it's
hard to compete with the big guy.

37:38.330 --> 37:42.790
Yeah. Maybe god could be a
little less indirect next time.

37:42.800 --> 37:46.090
Acally, I meant john lennon.

37:47.090 --> 37:53.300
I'll tell you, though, what I wouldn't
give to see what you see just once.

38:02.060 --> 38:05.610
Eli, care to join me for dinner?

38:05.620 --> 38:11.380
Oh, uh, actually, I... I'm
just-- I'm going on a blind date.

38:12.420 --> 38:18.060
Makes sense. I appear to have run out of
daughters and associates for you to romance.

38:20.380 --> 38:21.690
Are you okay?

38:21.700 --> 38:23.690
It's just-- I've--I've
noticed lots of late nights,

38:23.700 --> 38:28.310
and you got nothing better to
do than grab a bite with me.

38:29.200 --> 38:32.840
Ellen and I have separated.

38:36.380 --> 38:39.450
Sorry. I... uh, is
there anything I can do?

38:39.460 --> 38:41.600
A tale of woe for another night.

38:41.620 --> 38:44.220
You have someone waiting.

38:44.230 --> 38:50.640
And, eli, when you and i do grab a bite, it
won't be because I have nothing better to do.

39:01.850 --> 39:05.020
you're speechless.
It's gotta be a first.

39:05.030 --> 39:10.900
I think we've said or not said
all there is to say or not say.

39:10.910 --> 39:14.690
What you said last night-- it--it couldn't
have been easy taking a chance like that,

39:14.710 --> 39:18.800
and I'm sorry, I am so sorry, I
couldn't take that leap with you.

39:18.830 --> 39:21.860
Like you said, you can't
say what you don't feel.

39:21.870 --> 39:25.760
No, but I should have
said what i am feeling.

39:25.770 --> 39:28.860
I should have said that I...

39:28.870 --> 39:32.420
don't know if I love you... yet.

39:33.210 --> 39:38.410
Yeah, there's a reason no one's ever written a
hit song called "I don't know if I love you yet."

39:40.640 --> 39:43.870
I'm my father's daughter, matt.

39:43.890 --> 39:47.980
Sharing my feelings with
someone is very difficult for me.

39:47.990 --> 39:52.390
And the one time I actually did
truly open my heart to someone, he...

39:52.420 --> 39:54.850
broke off our engagement.

39:54.870 --> 39:57.160
And then came
"the dowd"--

39:57.170 --> 40:01.770
a guy I didn't even think I'd give
a drawer to in my apartment, and...

40:04.150 --> 40:07.810
it's taken me a while
to make that switch...

40:08.120 --> 40:10.520
but I'm making it.

40:10.530 --> 40:14.110
I only know one thing,
that you and me...

40:14.120 --> 40:17.010
but especily me...

40:17.030 --> 40:20.720
we're never gonna survive unless...

40:21.540 --> 40:23.740
we get a little crazy.

40:23.750 --> 40:27.130
* And through a fractal
on a breaking wall *

40:27.140 --> 40:33.040
* I see you, my friend
and touch your face again *

40:33.050 --> 40:33.580
how'd you...

40:33.590 --> 40:37.870
I know people who know people who know
maggie, who knows people who know seal.

40:37.880 --> 40:41.340
- Yeah.
- Forget "like." I think I love you.

40:41.350 --> 40:45.870
At's the point of being a disgustingly rich
heiress if you can't do stuff like this, right?

40:45.890 --> 40:48.980
Now this is epic. Thank you.

40:49.820 --> 40:53.540
* Oh, no, we'll never survive *

40:53.550 --> 40:59.180
* you see, unless we get a little bit *

40:59.190 --> 41:06.120
* crazy *

41:10.050 --> 41:14.690
* no, we're never gonna survive *

41:14.700 --> 41:19.570
* unless we get a little crazy *

41:20.200 --> 41:23.850
* no,we'll never survive *

41:23.860 --> 41:27.050
* unless we get a little bit crazy *

41:27.060 --> 41:29.860
are there any newcomers with us tonight?

41:32.510 --> 41:34.740
welcome.

41:37.080 --> 41:39.160
Sorry I'm late. I'm eli.

41:39.170 --> 41:41.910
- I'm ashley.
- Hi, ashley.

41:42.970 --> 41:44.850
- Have you been waiting long?
- No, not at all.

41:44.860 --> 41:46.570
- You look beautiful.
- Thank you.
