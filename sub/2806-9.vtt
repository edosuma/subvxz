WEBVTT

00:06.089 --> 00:07.131
I'm ready.

00:07.298 --> 00:08.632
- You sure?
- Uh-huh.

00:08.800 --> 00:11.468
Okay, let me just straighten out
your helmet there.

00:11.678 --> 00:15.347
- Thanks, Daddy.
- No, no. One daddy, two mommies.

00:17.058 --> 00:20.060
- All right, it's all yours.
- Okay, okay.

00:20.270 --> 00:21.520
There you go, there you go.

00:22.897 --> 00:26.233
Wow, Ben's first big kid's bike.
This is so exciting.

00:26.443 --> 00:28.402
Oh, yeah, I remember mine.

00:28.611 --> 00:31.113
It was my sixth birthday.
My dad took me to the park...

00:31.322 --> 00:34.783
...and I got on it and... it bent.
- Yeah.

00:35.869 --> 00:38.454
- I never had a bike of my own.
- What?

00:38.663 --> 00:40.456
Well, we didn't have a lot of money.

00:40.665 --> 00:43.417
But the girl across the street
had the best bike.

00:43.626 --> 00:48.047
It was pink and it had rainbow-colored
tassels hanging off the handle grips...

00:48.298 --> 00:51.258
...and a bell,
and this big, white wicker basket...

00:51.509 --> 00:54.511
...with those
plastic daisies stuck on.

00:55.055 --> 00:57.306
That sounds like my first bike.

00:58.767 --> 01:00.559
My dad gave me his old one.

01:01.728 --> 01:03.896
- Did the girl ever let you ride it?
- No.

01:04.105 --> 01:06.482
But she gave me the box
that it came in.

01:06.983 --> 01:09.818
It had a picture of the bike
on the front.

01:10.445 --> 01:14.615
So I would sit on it and my stepdad
would drag me around the backyard.

01:15.408 --> 01:17.034
That is so unfair.

01:17.368 --> 01:20.245
Not really, I got to drag him around too.

02:05.208 --> 02:07.042
Hey, what are you guys doing?

02:07.252 --> 02:09.336
Making holiday candy for the neighbors.

02:09.795 --> 02:10.838
I'm sorry, who?

02:12.382 --> 02:14.466
I'm gonna hang this basket on the door.

02:14.676 --> 02:17.636
When the neighbors walk by,
they can all take a piece.

02:19.055 --> 02:21.265
- But we don't know the neighbors.
- I do.

02:21.474 --> 02:24.643
There's, uh, let's see,
the guy with the mustache...

02:24.853 --> 02:28.188
...smokes-a-lot lady,
some kids I've seen...

02:28.439 --> 02:32.442
...and the red-haired guy
who does not like to be called Rusty.

02:33.111 --> 02:35.654
See, this is exactly why
I'm making this candy.

02:35.822 --> 02:37.990
We can learn their names
and get to know our neighbors.

02:38.199 --> 02:40.576
Wouldn't it be easier if we just moved?

02:43.204 --> 02:45.414
Good morning.

02:45.623 --> 02:48.959
- Ah, somebody's in a good mood.
- Well, why shouldn't I be?

02:49.169 --> 02:52.171
I have great friends.
I have a wonderful job...

02:52.380 --> 02:54.131
Where you can make out
with your assistant.

02:55.633 --> 02:56.800
Come on, it's not a big deal.

02:57.010 --> 02:58.844
We stayed up all night
coming up with a plan...

02:59.012 --> 03:01.054
...so that us dating will not be a problem.

03:01.264 --> 03:03.056
Oh, yeah? What's the plan?

03:06.477 --> 03:09.730
We... We are not...

03:10.732 --> 03:12.649
...going to let it...

03:12.859 --> 03:14.526
...be a problem.

03:15.570 --> 03:18.655
Wow. It took you all night
to come up with that plan?

03:18.865 --> 03:20.699
Oh, well, you know,
we did other stuff too.

03:22.577 --> 03:23.660
Did you two?

03:23.870 --> 03:26.455
Oh, Monica, you know I don't
sleep with guys on the first date.

03:26.664 --> 03:29.291
- Matt Wire, Mark Lynn, Ben Wise...
- Anymore.

03:36.257 --> 03:39.635
Hi, Tag, um, I have a conference call
today, is that correct?

03:39.844 --> 03:42.888
- Yes, at 4.
- Okay, thank you, that'll be all.

03:43.598 --> 03:44.640
Wait, wait.

03:49.187 --> 03:50.229
Did you see that?

03:50.438 --> 03:53.565
That mail guy had no idea there was
something going on between us.

04:01.241 --> 04:04.743
- I'd better get back to my desk.
- Okay, hard worker.

04:06.746 --> 04:08.747
I'll remember to put that
in your evaluation.

04:09.249 --> 04:12.042
- My what?
- You've been here for two months now...

04:12.252 --> 04:15.921
...and your boss is required
to hand in a performance evaluation.

04:16.130 --> 04:20.007
But you know, there is one thing
that I have yet to evaluate.

04:26.849 --> 04:30.852
- Are you serious?
- No, I've just always wanted to do that.

04:31.521 --> 04:33.355
Can you help me clean this up?

04:39.195 --> 04:42.281
The basket is totally empty.
My God, the neighbors ate all the candy.

04:42.448 --> 04:44.074
Well, either that or, uh...

04:46.703 --> 04:47.744
Joey.

04:49.956 --> 04:50.998
Yeah?

04:51.207 --> 04:54.334
- Did you eat all the neighbor candy?
- Uh, well, yeah, that was the plan.

04:54.544 --> 04:57.796
But by the time I got to it
there was only a couple pieces left.

04:58.006 --> 05:00.132
Yeah. They've been coming by all day.
They love it.

05:00.800 --> 05:02.968
They love my candy?

05:03.219 --> 05:06.221
- Oh, man, I gotta go make more.
- Hey, Mon.

05:06.431 --> 05:11.393
Make some more lasagna too. Something
might have happened to a huge chunk of it.

05:12.312 --> 05:14.479
Ross, the neighbors ate all my candy.

05:14.689 --> 05:16.273
Mine stole my newspaper.

05:16.482 --> 05:18.066
It's like a crime wave.

05:22.238 --> 05:24.406
Pheebs, you, uh, got a second?

05:24.615 --> 05:26.408
- Sure.
- Yeah.

05:26.576 --> 05:29.036
Ever since you, uh,
told me that story about that bike...

05:29.287 --> 05:31.455
...I couldn't stop thinking about it.

05:31.664 --> 05:35.375
I mean, everyone should have
a first bike, you know? So...

05:39.213 --> 05:42.049
Oh, my God, Ross.

05:42.342 --> 05:44.176
- You like it?
- I love it.

05:44.427 --> 05:46.678
- Yeah?
- Oh. Oh, God...

05:46.929 --> 05:49.181
- And I love you.
- Ah.

05:49.349 --> 05:50.807
Not that way.

05:51.476 --> 05:53.643
- But the bike got you a lot closer.
- Oh.

05:54.312 --> 05:56.104
Well, uh, take it downstairs.

05:56.314 --> 05:58.148
You know, give it a test drive.

05:58.358 --> 06:00.525
Okay. Oh, my God.

06:00.985 --> 06:02.903
My first bike.

06:03.196 --> 06:06.198
Thank you for the best present
I've ever gotten.

06:06.824 --> 06:08.325
You're welcome.

06:10.620 --> 06:12.788
Oh, and Chandler's about to cry.

06:14.999 --> 06:16.249
Am not.

06:20.922 --> 06:22.047
Who is that?

06:22.840 --> 06:26.927
Don't worry, I'm brave.
I am brave. I... I am brave.

06:28.471 --> 06:30.263
No, no, no, no, no.

06:31.557 --> 06:33.809
Can you tell me who is there, please?

06:34.894 --> 06:37.562
My name's Gary. I live upstairs.

06:39.899 --> 06:41.191
- Hi.
- Hi.

06:41.401 --> 06:43.902
- Do you know what time it is?
- It's candy time.

06:45.446 --> 06:48.573
My roommate says that they taste
like little drops of heaven.

06:48.783 --> 06:50.659
Oh, please. Heh.

06:50.993 --> 06:53.829
Did you hear that?
"Little drops of heaven."

06:55.415 --> 06:56.957
Four a.m.

06:57.208 --> 06:59.376
So can I get some candy?

06:59.627 --> 07:03.839
I am sorry, but some of us
have to get up early and go to work.

07:04.340 --> 07:07.592
He does not know
that I am not "some of us."

07:09.720 --> 07:12.722
Um, listen, I'm sorry, but I'll put some out
first thing in the morning.

07:12.932 --> 07:15.308
Well, okay, I'll swing by later.

07:15.560 --> 07:17.394
- You live in this building?
- Mm-hm.

07:17.562 --> 07:20.480
Mm. Seems like I would have
remembered you.

07:22.608 --> 07:25.527
Mm. Night, Gar.

07:37.915 --> 07:40.250
So did you read your evaluation yet?

07:40.460 --> 07:42.836
No, it was marked "confidential."

07:43.087 --> 07:45.088
I just sent it down to human resources.

07:48.509 --> 07:52.387
Okay, please, you're kidding, right?
I wrote that one as a joke for you.

07:52.597 --> 07:54.431
A joke they would appreciate?

07:54.640 --> 07:57.017
I'm thinking no.

07:57.685 --> 08:02.063
- What did you say?
- Um, I said that you were a good kisser...

08:02.273 --> 08:06.610
...and, uh, that I liked
your teeny, tiny tushy.

08:07.570 --> 08:09.779
No, not my tushy.

08:09.989 --> 08:11.114
Well, it gets worse.

08:11.324 --> 08:13.241
When asked if you take initiative,
I wrote:

08:13.409 --> 08:16.995
"Yes, he was able to unhook my bra
with minimal supervision."

08:18.289 --> 08:22.876
And under problems with performance,
I wrote, "Dear God, I hope not."

08:23.461 --> 08:27.547
And then, uh...
And then I drew a little smiley face.

08:27.757 --> 08:30.967
And then a small pornographic sketch.

08:40.269 --> 08:43.188
Ross, that is so sweet of you
to get Phoebe that bike.

08:43.397 --> 08:45.690
When I heard the story, I almost cried.

08:45.900 --> 08:47.400
Almost cried, huh?

08:47.652 --> 08:49.986
Hear that, Chandler? "Almost" cried.

08:51.239 --> 08:54.491
Hey, you cry every time
somebody talks about Titanic.

08:54.867 --> 08:57.285
Those two had only each other.

08:58.454 --> 08:59.871
Phoebe really likes the bike, huh?

09:00.081 --> 09:02.666
Oh, yeah. I saw her
walking it down the street the other day.

09:02.875 --> 09:05.961
She had these flowers in the basket.
It was so cute.

09:06.212 --> 09:08.964
Yeah, I saw her this morning
walking it by the park.

09:09.840 --> 09:13.760
Wait a minute, she was walking the bike?
Both times?

09:15.012 --> 09:17.222
- Hey, Pheebs.
- Oh, hi.

09:17.473 --> 09:21.268
- Hey, so you enjoying the bike?
- Oh, uh-huh, so much. Heh.

09:21.978 --> 09:27.065
Pheebs, you, uh... You do know
how to ride a bike, don't you? Heh.

09:28.859 --> 09:30.277
Of course.

09:32.154 --> 09:33.613
Can we see you ride it?

09:33.948 --> 09:35.448
Okay.

09:49.922 --> 09:51.381
See?

09:59.557 --> 10:02.350
This is why I told you
never get involved with your assistant.

10:02.560 --> 10:05.937
And there's no such thing as keeping
secrets when it comes to having affairs.

10:06.856 --> 10:08.940
Did you hear that, Chandler?

10:09.734 --> 10:11.109
No such thing.

10:12.778 --> 10:15.488
What happened? I'm just eating candy.

10:17.283 --> 10:21.119
Maybe it's not as bad as I think.
Maybe they didn't take it the way I meant it.

10:21.329 --> 10:25.040
Absolutely, you know?
Because "tushy" can mean both ass...

10:25.291 --> 10:26.791
...and good worker.

10:28.628 --> 10:30.712
Ugh, I just gotta get the thing back.

10:30.921 --> 10:32.881
Rach? That sketch you mentioned?

10:33.090 --> 10:35.717
Might it have looked
a little something like this?

10:36.135 --> 10:37.886
Oh, my God, Joey.

10:39.680 --> 10:42.098
- What is the matter with you?
- God.

10:43.684 --> 10:47.062
I tell you, this little talent came in handy
before I could afford porn.

10:52.943 --> 10:57.322
Hi, I'm sorry. I know it's after hours,
but I really need candy.

10:57.782 --> 11:00.825
I'm sorry, I can't help you.
See? Rules are rules.

11:01.035 --> 11:04.037
Please, I have people coming
from out of town today.

11:04.246 --> 11:07.123
- I told them all about your candy.
- You're kidding.

11:07.333 --> 11:10.377
Out-of-towners, huh? Heh.
What did you tell them?

11:10.586 --> 11:14.005
I told them your candy
was absolutely indescribable.

11:14.256 --> 11:19.219
Well, some people have been saying it's
"little drops of heaven," but whatever.

11:19.804 --> 11:23.765
- Please, can't you help me out?
- Hey, Chandler, do we know that lady?

11:23.974 --> 11:28.019
Maybe. Isn't she the woman who lives
below you and has sex really loud?

11:28.229 --> 11:30.438
All right, I'll do it just this once.

11:30.648 --> 11:33.900
- But you can't tell anybody.
- Yes, yes, please, just give it to me.

11:34.151 --> 11:36.319
Yeah, that's her.

11:37.154 --> 11:39.155
- Thank you.
- Unbelievable.

11:39.365 --> 11:41.783
I can't believe that sign didn't work.

11:41.992 --> 11:44.994
You know what would work?
Stop making candy.

11:45.913 --> 11:47.247
But they like it.

11:48.082 --> 11:49.499
You mean they like you.

11:50.793 --> 11:51.835
Maybe.

11:52.211 --> 11:55.463
Is that why you became a chef,
so that people would like you?

11:55.673 --> 11:59.759
Heh. You want to talk about getting
people to like you, huh, funny man?

12:09.437 --> 12:12.689
Okay, now, just remember
everything I taught you and you'll be fine.

12:12.898 --> 12:14.649
Okay? Here we go.

12:14.859 --> 12:16.776
Ready, set...

12:16.986 --> 12:19.904
Wait, this seat is really uncomfortable.

12:20.156 --> 12:23.283
Maybe before we start
we should just get another one.

12:23.492 --> 12:26.911
Perhaps like an airplane seat,
or a beanbag chair.

12:27.830 --> 12:32.000
Phoebe, you can't get out of this, okay?
You have to learn how to ride a bike.

12:32.209 --> 12:35.128
Why? Why do I have to learn?

12:36.130 --> 12:40.508
- Well, in case of an emergency.
- What kind of emergency?

12:40.718 --> 12:45.180
Well, what if a man comes along
and puts a gun to your head and says:

12:45.389 --> 12:48.057
"You ride this bike or I'll...

12:48.350 --> 12:50.769
I'll shoot you."

12:51.187 --> 12:53.521
Okay. I would ring the bell
to distract him...

12:53.731 --> 12:57.400
...and then I would knock the gun out
of his hand with a Chinese throwing star.

12:58.569 --> 13:01.821
Okay, Phoebe, just get on the bike...

13:02.072 --> 13:05.867
...and, hey, I'll hold you up
and push you. Okay?

13:07.244 --> 13:08.745
You won't let go?

13:08.954 --> 13:10.246
- No.
- You swear?

13:10.456 --> 13:11.706
I swear.

13:13.542 --> 13:15.376
- Okay.
- Come on.

13:18.464 --> 13:21.216
- Here we go. All right? All right?
- All right.

13:21.425 --> 13:23.426
Feel good?
All right, try pedaling.

13:23.636 --> 13:26.805
That's it, you're doing great.
Yes, take control.

13:27.014 --> 13:29.307
- Yes, yes, yes.
- Whee! Hey!

13:30.476 --> 13:31.518
Oh, oh!

13:31.685 --> 13:33.520
Oh, no.

13:35.272 --> 13:36.564
You swore.

13:36.774 --> 13:41.444
- I just thought you were doing so well.
- I am shocked. Shocked.

13:46.033 --> 13:48.535
It's a legitimate learning technique.

13:49.703 --> 13:51.037
Wow.

13:58.337 --> 13:59.379
Hey.

13:59.588 --> 14:03.967
There's, uh, some people outside
asking about candy.

14:04.176 --> 14:07.512
They're just gonna have to wait,
aren't they? I only got two hands.

14:07.972 --> 14:11.057
- Need some help?
- No, you don't know the system.

14:11.267 --> 14:13.768
I don't need nobody messing
with the system.

14:14.603 --> 14:18.690
By the way, the week before your wedding,
you may not see a lot of me.

14:29.201 --> 14:31.035
Oh, hello, liar.

14:33.664 --> 14:37.500
Look, I'm really sorry I let go of the bike.

14:37.710 --> 14:39.752
I could've been killed, I hope you know.

14:41.714 --> 14:43.506
I know, I know.

14:45.259 --> 14:47.385
But can we please try it again?

14:47.636 --> 14:49.971
I mean, you were so close, Phoebe.

14:50.180 --> 14:52.765
Well, I would love to...

14:53.517 --> 14:56.769
...but the bike got stolen
and the police have no suspects.

15:03.193 --> 15:04.485
- Phoebe.
- What?

15:07.573 --> 15:09.449
What the hell?

15:10.951 --> 15:11.993
All right, you know what?

15:12.202 --> 15:15.330
If you are not going to learn
how to ride this bike, then I'm sorry...

15:15.539 --> 15:17.707
...I'm just gonna have to take it back.
- What? Why?

15:17.875 --> 15:21.127
Because. Because it's...

15:22.046 --> 15:25.423
It'd be like you having this guitar...

15:25.633 --> 15:27.425
...and never playing it.

15:27.676 --> 15:30.553
Okay, this guitar wants to be played.

15:30.804 --> 15:33.890
And this bike wants to be ridden.

15:34.141 --> 15:36.392
And if you don't ride it...

15:36.644 --> 15:40.688
...you're killing its spirit.

15:42.691 --> 15:43.983
The bike...

15:44.860 --> 15:46.569
...is dying.

15:50.616 --> 15:55.119
All right. If you care enough
to make up that load of crap, okay.

15:55.621 --> 15:56.996
Great.

15:59.583 --> 16:01.626
You're making the bike very happy.

16:01.835 --> 16:03.086
Okay, Ross.

16:06.006 --> 16:07.840
Please don't die.

16:11.428 --> 16:14.013
Okay, I think we can get the evaluation back
before they see it.

16:14.181 --> 16:18.685
We have to get into Mr. Zelner's office.
He doesn't get in until 10, so no problem.

16:18.894 --> 16:22.939
But his assistant, Betty, comes in early
to eat her breakfast at her desk.

16:23.148 --> 16:26.401
- That's kind of sad.
- Yeah, well, Betty's kind of sad.

16:26.819 --> 16:30.571
Which is why I believe I can lure her away
with these chocolates.

16:32.116 --> 16:34.200
Now, while I distract her,
you go in the office.

16:34.410 --> 16:35.785
- Got it.
- Let's roll.

16:37.496 --> 16:39.706
Hello, Rachel. You, uh, got a minute?

16:39.915 --> 16:43.251
Yeah, sure, Mr. Zelner.
For you? Anything. Minute.

16:43.460 --> 16:45.294
Okay, great.

16:45.546 --> 16:47.130
Abort the plan. Abort the plan.

16:47.923 --> 16:50.591
Uh, actually,
I'd like to speak to both of you.

16:51.051 --> 16:52.260
Okay.

16:53.012 --> 16:57.849
Uh, well, can we get you anything,
Mr. Zelner? Maybe some chocolates?

16:58.517 --> 17:02.145
Um, no, thanks,
but I'll give these to Betty.

17:04.147 --> 17:06.858
So I read your evaluation of Tag.

17:07.108 --> 17:10.444
Or, uh, to use his full name,
Tag "Sweet Cheeks" Jones?

17:12.196 --> 17:14.365
Is something going on with you two?

17:15.909 --> 17:19.996
Oh, my God,
can you imagine if there was?

17:21.749 --> 17:25.334
I mean, what would happen exactly?

17:26.502 --> 17:29.005
Well, I'd be forced to file a report.

17:29.214 --> 17:31.924
I'd have to consult
with the legal department.

17:32.134 --> 17:34.677
And your future at the company
would be in jeopardy.

17:36.555 --> 17:38.139
- Well...
- Uh, Mr. Zelner...

17:38.849 --> 17:41.100
...I'm the one
who filled in that evaluation.

17:41.268 --> 17:42.560
- Oh, no...
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

17:42.811 --> 17:44.812
I thought it would be funny.

17:46.106 --> 17:48.983
You wrote that you have a cute tushy?

17:50.527 --> 17:51.569
Yes.

17:51.779 --> 17:54.238
I have a weird sense of humor.

17:54.490 --> 17:56.991
And I'm kind of strangely
proud of my butt.

17:58.452 --> 18:00.661
It's kind of a risky joke, Tag.

18:01.288 --> 18:03.998
And what is this drawing?
I can't figure out what this is.

18:04.208 --> 18:07.543
You're looking at it upside down...
You know what? It doesn't matter.

18:08.962 --> 18:11.464
Hey, it's not like I don't have
a sense of humor, huh?

18:11.673 --> 18:15.259
Hell, I even enjoy a naughty limerick
every now and then.

18:17.888 --> 18:19.514
But there's a time and a place, huh?

18:21.517 --> 18:24.227
Unless you, uh,
have a limerick right now.

18:26.814 --> 18:30.566
No? Okay.
Well, uh, you've got my fax number.

18:38.617 --> 18:41.202
I can't believe you did that.
That was really sweet.

18:41.411 --> 18:44.288
- Ah, don't worry about it.
- No, you could've lost your job.

18:44.540 --> 18:47.750
Are you kidding me?
With a cute butt like this, I'd find work.

18:49.962 --> 18:51.921
Thank you, you're great.

18:54.007 --> 18:55.925
- You know what?
- What?

18:56.218 --> 18:58.010
I feel great.

18:58.637 --> 19:00.513
In fact...

19:05.227 --> 19:06.269
What?

19:06.979 --> 19:10.857
It's just... It took me so long
to get that desk organized.

19:11.233 --> 19:13.025
I'm sorry.

19:14.153 --> 19:16.070
There it is.

19:27.958 --> 19:29.167
What is going on?

19:29.376 --> 19:32.753
We're waiting for the candy.
Bring out the candy.

19:32.963 --> 19:35.339
Yeah, lady, give us candy.

19:36.884 --> 19:37.925
Joey.

19:38.844 --> 19:41.012
- What's up, buddy?
- What are you doing?

19:42.723 --> 19:44.307
Waiting to get candy.

19:44.933 --> 19:46.601
Get in here.

19:46.894 --> 19:50.354
Hey, and you cannot smoke in here.

19:53.859 --> 19:55.234
Merry Christmas.

19:56.445 --> 20:00.656
Okay, guys, the candy is coming. I just
need 15 minutes for the chocolate to cool.

20:02.201 --> 20:06.829
All right, everybody, just be quiet.
Be quiet. Be quiet. Pipe down.

20:07.039 --> 20:09.165
What is the matter with you people?

20:09.374 --> 20:12.501
This woman was trying to do
a nice thing for you.

20:12.711 --> 20:16.172
She was making candy so she could
try to get to know all of you...

20:16.381 --> 20:19.842
...and I'll bet that not one of you
can tell me her name.

20:20.052 --> 20:21.510
Am I right?

20:22.221 --> 20:24.096
Candy Lady?

20:25.390 --> 20:27.725
No, not "Candy Lady."

20:28.477 --> 20:30.853
If we know it, can we have candy?

20:32.022 --> 20:33.773
All right, you know what?

20:34.483 --> 20:36.525
Forget it. All of you, forget it.
You've ruined it.

20:36.735 --> 20:38.778
Go home. You've ruined it.
You've ruined it.

20:38.987 --> 20:42.740
That's all wrong. You guys
ruined everything. You ruined it.

20:49.581 --> 20:52.124
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

20:54.169 --> 20:55.294
Did you smoke?

20:55.963 --> 21:01.384
No, smokes-a-lot lady blew smoke
directly into my mouth.

21:02.386 --> 21:03.761
Uh, are you okay?

21:03.971 --> 21:06.597
I'm fine now, but it was
really scary there for a while.

21:06.807 --> 21:09.892
Someone slipped a threatening note
under the door.

21:10.102 --> 21:14.021
Oh, yeah. Sorry about that.
Mob mentality or whatever. I don't know.

21:24.783 --> 21:27.910
I can't believe it. I did it.
I rode a bike.

21:28.120 --> 21:31.247
I never thought I'd be able to do that.
Thank you, Ross.

21:31.456 --> 21:33.791
Oh, hey, don't thank me.
Thank yourself.

21:34.001 --> 21:37.837
You're the one who faced your fears
and ultimately overcame them.

21:38.046 --> 21:41.924
Don't be so corny, Ross.
It's not an After School Special.
