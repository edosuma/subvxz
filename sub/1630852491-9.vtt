Is this the neighborhood
where they filmed

19:19.810 --> 19:21.203
So I Married an Axe Murderer?

19:21.247 --> 19:23.205
"Look at the size
of that boy's head.

19:23.249 --> 19:25.642
It's like a... an orange
on a toothpick."

19:25.686 --> 19:28.384
-[both laugh]
-N-Not quite.

19:28.428 --> 19:30.256
-Oh.
-I-I wanted you...

19:30.299 --> 19:32.693
-Uh-huh.
-...to see this.

19:36.653 --> 19:40.048
We haven't really mentioned
the elephant in the room,

19:40.091 --> 19:44.008
and I think it's time that we
at least start talking about it.

19:44.052 --> 19:45.706
I miss you.

19:45.749 --> 19:49.231
I miss the kids, and I think,
I think that this would be

19:49.275 --> 19:50.624
perfect for us.

19:52.452 --> 19:53.670
To... buy?

19:53.714 --> 19:56.499
To think about,
if you're willing.

20:00.068 --> 20:01.200
Can I show you?

20:03.289 --> 20:05.116
Come on.

20:05.160 --> 20:08.294
There's three bedrooms upstairs,
each with their own bathroom.

20:08.337 --> 20:10.121
And don't forget
the converted ADU

20:10.165 --> 20:11.558
off the garage for grandma.

20:11.601 --> 20:13.255
-Good to see you, Toby.
-TOBY: How are you, Larry?

20:13.299 --> 20:14.517
Thanks for seeing us.

20:14.561 --> 20:16.040
-This is my wife.
-Kate.

20:16.084 --> 20:18.042
So nice to finally meet you.

20:18.086 --> 20:19.522
-Hi.
-[Larry laughs]

20:19.566 --> 20:22.264
Toby, in answer to your
question, I found out the owners

20:22.308 --> 20:24.179
updated the kitchen and the HVAC

20:24.223 --> 20:25.311
-five years ago.
-Great.

20:25.354 --> 20:26.703
LARRY:
And they'd be open

20:26.747 --> 20:28.749
to leaving the trampoline
for Jack and Hailey.

20:28.792 --> 20:30.707
Yes!

20:30.751 --> 20:32.274
[Toby laughs]

20:32.318 --> 20:34.407
-I'll let you guys explore.
-Thank you.

20:34.450 --> 20:35.495
Oh, yeah, there's a trampoline.

20:35.538 --> 20:37.453
[chuckles]

20:37.497 --> 20:38.976
How many times
have you been here?

20:39.020 --> 20:40.717
Just a couple.
I run by here all the time.

20:40.761 --> 20:42.458
I've always loved this house.

20:42.502 --> 20:44.634
One day, a "for sale" sign
went up, and, I don't know,

20:44.678 --> 20:47.507
it just got me thinking.
The great part is that

20:47.550 --> 20:49.683
the kids' rooms aren't too far
from what would be our room,

20:49.726 --> 20:51.467
so we'd be close but not
right on top of each other.

20:51.511 --> 20:53.295
Come on, I want to show you.

20:58.518 --> 21:01.303
Larry, thank you so much.
I'll call you, okay?

21:01.347 --> 21:03.436
I will. Don't do anything
until I call.

21:03.479 --> 21:05.525
[sighs]

21:05.568 --> 21:08.441
So... so, what'd you think, huh?

21:09.572 --> 21:11.966
I think it's overwhelming.

21:12.009 --> 21:14.925
I'm... I am sure. I know that,
I know that this feels quick,

21:14.969 --> 21:17.145
but don't panic, the owners
aren't accepting offers

21:17.188 --> 21:19.365
until the day after tomorrow,
so we have plenty of time

21:19.408 --> 21:21.715
to think about it and put
together a pros-and-cons list.

21:21.758 --> 21:23.543
Uh, the day after tomorrow
is not enough time

21:23.586 --> 21:25.762
to-to make this...
this huge decision.

21:25.806 --> 21:28.461
I mean, Toby,
can we even afford it?

21:28.504 --> 21:30.332
Yes. We can.

21:30.376 --> 21:32.029
Because I may have
already gotten us

21:32.073 --> 21:33.770
preapproved for a loan

21:33.814 --> 21:35.729
and talked to a real estate
agent back in L.A.

21:35.772 --> 21:37.296
about what we could get
for our house.

21:39.298 --> 21:42.039
Toby, I thought that
we were just, like,

21:42.083 --> 21:44.477
wrapping our heads around the
idea of San Francisco, and...

21:44.520 --> 21:46.348
and now we're making
this big decision

21:46.392 --> 21:47.915
and putting an offer on a house

21:47.958 --> 21:50.570
-that I'm-I'm seeing
for the first time?
-I know.

21:50.613 --> 21:52.528
I'm sorry. I just, I-I didn't,

21:52.572 --> 21:54.748
I didn't want to present you
with hypotheticals.

21:54.791 --> 21:57.490
Kate, trust me, I have put
a lot of thought into this.

21:57.533 --> 22:01.145
There are these
incredible hiking trails

22:01.189 --> 22:03.278
that lead to an awesome park
right on the Bay.

22:03.322 --> 22:05.236
We're near the airport
for easy trips back to L.A.

22:07.630 --> 22:09.632
Kate...

22:09.676 --> 22:12.243
we can do this.

22:12.287 --> 22:14.376
We can make a life up here,

22:14.420 --> 22:16.247
together.

22:19.076 --> 22:21.252
Come on, let me show you where
your mom and Miguel can stay.

22:21.296 --> 22:22.471
Come on. You're gonna love it.

22:27.607 --> 22:30.000
Okay, Katie girl. You ready to
get your face in the water, huh?

22:30.044 --> 22:32.438
Come on, come on. Let's do it
together, let's do it together.

22:32.481 --> 22:34.396
-We'll do it together.
-No, no, no, no, no!

22:34.440 --> 22:36.006
Okay, okay, how about, uh...

22:39.445 --> 22:42.012
How about a new tactic, okay?

22:42.056 --> 22:45.625
How about... how about
we float on your back?

22:45.668 --> 22:48.497
Okay? I'll be right here so
that you don't go under, okay?

22:48.541 --> 22:51.021
All right, here,
just let go, just let go.

22:52.719 --> 22:55.635
Okay, so...

22:55.678 --> 22:57.071
you're in a bad spot,

22:57.114 --> 23:00.422
but that's just for now.

23:00.466 --> 23:02.076
Dad hasn't been gone that long.

23:02.119 --> 23:04.339
-Everything's weird.
-Yeah.

23:04.383 --> 23:06.559
And maybe instead of focusing
on what's not so great,

23:06.602 --> 23:08.561
you can focus on what
you want to happen next.

23:08.604 --> 23:11.041
Like, what do you want to do?
What do you want to be?

23:11.085 --> 23:14.610
God, you guys. Come on.

23:14.654 --> 23:17.352
Guidance counselor's not
a good look on either of you.

23:17.396 --> 23:20.094
If you could dream
of doing anything,

23:20.137 --> 23:22.792
what would it be? Anything.

23:22.836 --> 23:24.881
That is the problem.

23:26.492 --> 23:28.450
I can't think of anything.

23:28.494 --> 23:30.452
Okay, I'm not like you guys.

23:30.496 --> 23:32.454
You know, you want
to be an actor,

23:32.498 --> 23:35.239
and you want
to change the world.

23:35.283 --> 23:37.807
We're the exact same age,
and you guys are

23:37.851 --> 23:40.506
way ahead of me.

23:40.549 --> 23:44.031
Randall, you've already met
the love of your life.

23:44.074 --> 23:45.815
And, Kevin, I mean,

23:45.859 --> 23:47.469
you're so far ahead, you've
already ruined one marriage.

23:52.431 --> 23:53.562
I just...

23:57.566 --> 24:00.613
When I look into my future...

24:02.092 --> 24:04.486
I literally see

24:04.530 --> 24:06.923
nothing.

24:06.967 --> 24:09.535
No job, no family.

24:12.581 --> 24:14.365
Nothing.

24:15.671 --> 24:17.717
TOBY:
You know,

24:17.760 --> 24:20.067
you wouldn't think it would
take this long to get a Lyft

24:20.110 --> 24:21.547
in the town
where the company was started.

24:23.418 --> 24:25.899
Hey, listen, I'm sorry

24:25.942 --> 24:28.379
that I sprung the house thing
on you like that.

24:28.423 --> 24:30.643
I-I meant for it
to be a grand gesture,

24:30.686 --> 24:33.428
and I think it might have been
a grand mistake.

24:33.472 --> 24:35.561
I'm just excited
for you to be up here.

24:35.604 --> 24:38.085
I know. I am, too.

24:38.128 --> 24:41.523
I'm just processing is all.

24:41.567 --> 24:43.569
-Okay. Yeah.
-Yeah.

24:43.612 --> 24:45.571
Everybody at work is really
excited to meet you tonight.

24:45.614 --> 24:47.573
I think we're gonna have
a really good time.

24:47.616 --> 24:49.357
Me, too.

24:49.400 --> 24:53.143
-The driver can cancel?
That's a thing?
-Mm-hmm.

24:53.187 --> 24:54.754
-Okay.
-Can we just walk?

24:54.797 --> 24:58.540
Uh, it...
No, I'll just get another one.

24:58.584 --> 25:01.587
Well, I thought you said
your boss lived close by.

25:01.630 --> 25:04.720
Yeah, it's not far,
but it's... it's...

25:04.764 --> 25:06.722
-You know.
-But what?

25:06.766 --> 25:10.509
It's-it's all up...
uphill, so...

25:14.730 --> 25:18.821
There we go. Casey is gonna
be here in eight minutes.

25:20.083 --> 25:23.043
Why is the car spinning
in circles?

25:23.086 --> 25:25.262
Oh, this is so beautiful.

25:25.306 --> 25:27.656
Yeah, my-my boss
sold his first company

25:27.700 --> 25:30.180
to Google
for a boatload of money.

25:30.224 --> 25:31.747
Like, literally,
that's how he got his boat.

25:31.791 --> 25:34.445
But he's surprisingly down
to earth, as is everyone,

25:34.489 --> 25:35.664
especially for a bunch
of tech weenies.

25:35.708 --> 25:37.666
Oh, and here's a warning.

25:37.710 --> 25:39.799
Do not ask anyone
what they actually do

25:39.842 --> 25:41.452
for work, trust me.

25:41.496 --> 25:43.454
There they are.
The couple of the hour.

25:43.498 --> 25:45.456
Finally, I get to meet
the famous Kate.

25:45.500 --> 25:47.589
-Hi.
-Kate, this is my boss, Amir.

25:47.633 --> 25:49.635
Nice to meet you,
and you are way too young

25:49.678 --> 25:50.940
to be the Amir
that I've heard so much about.

25:50.984 --> 25:52.594
What are you, like, 25?

25:52.638 --> 25:54.509
I love her instantly, Toby.

25:54.553 --> 25:56.076
-I knew you would.
-[Kate laughs]

25:56.119 --> 25:57.947
-Well, thank you
for having us tonight.
-Are you kidding?

25:57.991 --> 26:00.297
I've been wanting to meet you
ever since Toby joined us.

26:00.341 --> 26:03.387
-Come on, I'll give you a tour.
-Okay.
-[Toby sighs]

26:03.431 --> 26:04.780
So you've been with the company
a while, then?

26:04.824 --> 26:08.218
Yupper.
Started here after Facebook,

26:08.262 --> 26:10.786
-and just never left.
-Wow. And what do you do?

26:10.830 --> 26:13.789
Uh, you know how
most businesses can't afford

26:13.833 --> 26:18.011
non-technical managers
ideating unrealistic features?

26:18.054 --> 26:20.317
Mm-hmm.

26:20.361 --> 26:22.842
And your kids are so cute.
Toby showed me the picture

26:22.885 --> 26:25.018
of Hailey wrapped around Jack
like a baby koala.

26:25.061 --> 26:28.064
I called my wife immediately and
told her, "Let's have a baby."

26:28.108 --> 26:30.501
-Oh.
-TOBY: Their cuteness
is powerful.

26:30.545 --> 26:34.288
-Oh.
-It really is. Thank you.

26:34.331 --> 26:36.682
So, whether it's reporting
or machine learning,

26:36.725 --> 26:38.684
I automate tasks for the company

26:38.727 --> 26:40.511
because no one wants
communication

26:40.555 --> 26:42.122
and product inefficiencies
between the engineers

26:42.165 --> 26:43.645
and everybody else, right?

26:43.689 --> 26:45.647
-Right.
-Which is where I come in.

26:45.691 --> 26:47.649
What do you know
about infrastructure platforms?

26:47.693 --> 26:49.520
-Um...
-She thinks they're overrated,
just like Smash Mouth.

26:49.564 --> 26:51.871
Have you tried this? Try this.

26:51.914 --> 26:53.524
-Oh. Thanks. Sure.
-Thanks so much.
Can I borrow her? Hey, come on.

26:53.568 --> 26:54.874
-Enjoy.
-[laughs]

26:54.917 --> 26:56.353
How you doing? You doing okay?

26:56.397 --> 26:58.051
Yeah. Yeah, I really am.

26:58.094 --> 27:01.532
-I mean, Toby,
everybody's really great.
-Yeah.

27:01.576 --> 27:03.883
-Hi, Kate. Sorry to interrupt.
-Hi.

27:03.926 --> 27:05.885
But Warren said you agreed
to trade him Steph Curry.

27:05.928 --> 27:07.887
-What? No!
-Is that true?

27:07.930 --> 27:09.889
Why would I do that? Curry's
like the heart of my team.

27:09.932 --> 27:11.673
Sorry.
This is fantasy basketball.

27:11.717 --> 27:14.067
I'll be back in one
and a half seconds. Bro.

27:14.110 --> 27:15.851
[laughing]:
What are you...

27:15.895 --> 27:18.593
What are you talking about,
I give you Curry?

27:18.637 --> 27:20.160
-WARREN: You said it.
-TOBY: I said it in a bar.

27:20.203 --> 27:22.336
-WARREN: Oh, no.
-I said it in bar.

27:22.379 --> 27:24.904
You can't believe anything
anyone says in a bar.

27:24.947 --> 27:26.906
-WARREN: That counts.
-That does not count.

27:26.949 --> 27:29.038
-Not in the state of California.
-It's happening. I'm sorry.

27:29.082 --> 27:31.650
[indistinct chatter]

27:43.226 --> 27:45.489
I'm so happy you came. [laughs]

27:45.533 --> 27:47.883
Toby's been a lifesaver up here.

27:47.927 --> 27:50.886
Most popular at the company
by multiple degrees

27:50.930 --> 27:53.323
in an office where everyone
genuinely likes each other.

27:53.367 --> 27:56.152
Well, the feeling
is very mutual.

27:56.196 --> 27:58.894
Thank God he turned down
the job offer back in L.A.

27:58.938 --> 28:02.332
Losing him would've been
a huge blow for us.

We got to... We have

Let's just find Amir,

28:56.822 --> 28:58.214
We're not saying goodbye.

28:58.258 --> 28:59.999
We're not going to dinner.
We need to leave.

29:01.740 --> 29:04.133
Okay. I'll just call us a Lyft.

What is...?
what's-what's the matter?

29:10.531 --> 29:11.924
You got a job offer in L.A.?

29:14.927 --> 29:17.799
Y-Yeah, I applied for that job

29:17.843 --> 29:19.801
long before
I got the job up here.

29:19.845 --> 29:21.585
And the official offer came in

29:21.629 --> 29:23.283
two weeks ago,
and it was a joke.

29:23.326 --> 29:25.241
It was, like, a big step-down
in title, and barely any money.

29:25.285 --> 29:26.852
You made a decision
that directly affects me

29:26.895 --> 29:28.854
and our children
without telling me?

29:28.897 --> 29:31.073
-You lied to me.
-I didn't lie to you.

29:31.117 --> 29:32.858
And you made a fool
out of me in there.

29:33.989 --> 29:35.295
Uh...

29:38.341 --> 29:39.995
Can we just talk about this
before we get in this car?

29:40.039 --> 29:41.301
No. I need a minute.

30:09.503 --> 30:11.287
All right, how much?

30:12.593 --> 30:14.029
How much what?

30:14.073 --> 30:15.857
How much more
does the job pay up here?

30:17.250 --> 30:18.947
You want me to give you numbers?

30:18.991 --> 30:20.993
Yeah. Yeah, Toby,
I'd like numbers.

30:21.036 --> 30:23.952
I need to know how much is worth
me giving up my job,

30:23.996 --> 30:26.259
and a house
where Jack feels comfortable,

30:26.302 --> 30:29.523
not to mention being near
my family and my sick mother

30:29.566 --> 30:31.917
in the same city as Hailey has
two cousins the same age

30:31.960 --> 30:34.310
-to grow up with.
-That's not a fair question.

30:34.354 --> 30:36.922
It's not fair that you're not
thinking about our family?

30:36.965 --> 30:38.924
I'm not thinking
about our family?

30:38.967 --> 30:40.969
Wow. That's awesome.

30:41.013 --> 30:42.797
How have you been, then?

30:42.841 --> 30:44.799
What do you think
I have been doing up here?

30:44.843 --> 30:46.801
Living out of a suitcase,

30:46.845 --> 30:48.934
not-not sure
which city I'm waking up in,

30:48.977 --> 30:51.806
spending all these lonely nights
in this antiseptic apartment.

30:51.850 --> 30:54.809
This is all
for our family, Kate.

30:54.853 --> 30:56.942
Do you know
that we have a blind son?

30:56.985 --> 30:58.813
Oh, really?
I-I didn't realize.

30:58.857 --> 31:00.380
I thought he was just clumsy.

31:00.423 --> 31:02.382
He knows every inch
of our house.

31:02.425 --> 31:04.384
We're teaching him a song
to get to the park.

31:04.427 --> 31:06.386
Okay, you think
it's easy to just, like,

31:06.429 --> 31:08.518
uproot him and-and put him
in a new environment?

31:08.562 --> 31:10.825
Okay, you get to ask
a bunch of questions.

31:10.869 --> 31:13.306
Let me ask a few.

31:13.349 --> 31:15.743
Have you penciled out
how expensive it would be

31:15.786 --> 31:18.006
to send Jack to a special school
if he needs one?

31:18.050 --> 31:19.921
Because I have.

31:19.965 --> 31:23.098
Never mind all of the assistive
technology he's gonna need.

31:23.142 --> 31:27.407
Do you know a braille notetaker
alone costs six grand?

31:27.450 --> 31:28.930
And that-that-that...
that's just

31:28.974 --> 31:30.932
when he's living
at home with us.

31:30.976 --> 31:32.325
What if he wants to go off
to college

31:32.368 --> 31:33.892
or live on his own one day?

31:35.241 --> 31:37.765
I have big dreams
for our son, Kate,

31:37.808 --> 31:41.160
and I'm gonna be damn sure
that he has whatever he needs

31:41.203 --> 31:43.771
to live his life
however he so chooses.

31:43.814 --> 31:47.122
And we can't afford any of that
on an assistant teacher salary

31:47.166 --> 31:49.559
and some middling job
in Los Angeles

31:49.603 --> 31:51.822
that doesn't pay me
any real money.

31:51.866 --> 31:54.173
Right. Money. Still haven't
told me the number.

31:58.829 --> 32:00.962
It's not just about the money,
is it?

32:03.660 --> 32:06.533
It's kind of about you. Right?

32:06.576 --> 32:08.535
Watching you up here--
I don't know--

32:08.578 --> 32:11.059
you're pretty much the happiest
you've ever been, aren't you?

32:11.103 --> 32:13.670
Kate, I am away from my family.

32:13.714 --> 32:17.239
I'm-I'm on four planes a week.
I am exhausted.

32:17.283 --> 32:20.155
Yeah, but you're happy, right?

32:20.199 --> 32:22.157
You're happy with your job,
with your stature.

32:22.201 --> 32:23.550
-[laughs]
-Personally, you're happy.

32:23.593 --> 32:25.247
I-I don't know why
you just can't admit it.

32:25.291 --> 32:27.206
Yes, yes, I'm happy!
I'm happy.

32:27.249 --> 32:28.685
And this is gonna sound
like a strange question

32:28.729 --> 32:30.600
to ask my wife,
but don't you want that for me?

32:30.644 --> 32:32.515
Of course I want that for you.

32:34.822 --> 32:36.911
Then why doesn't it
feel that way?

32:39.914 --> 32:42.177
You know,
sometimes I look at you, Toby,

32:42.221 --> 32:46.181
and I don't even know
who you are anymore. I don't.

32:46.225 --> 32:49.358
You drink expensive champagne.

32:49.402 --> 32:51.926
You know how to work a room.

32:51.970 --> 32:55.060
You're not the guy who wore
those terrible Hawaiian shirts

32:55.103 --> 32:57.671
or would make those loud,
inappropriate jokes.

32:57.714 --> 32:59.673
You're not the guy
who'd ask for the wine list

32:59.716 --> 33:01.240
and says,
"Bring me the whole left side."

33:01.283 --> 33:04.373
The goofy guy
from our first date,

33:04.417 --> 33:07.507
the Old Toby, the guy
that I fell in love with.

33:09.074 --> 33:11.119
I miss him.

33:13.252 --> 33:17.038
I miss him so much
that I've been picturing him

33:17.082 --> 33:19.040
this weekend here with me.

33:20.694 --> 33:22.435
So this whole time
that I've been thinking

33:22.478 --> 33:24.393
that we're really connecting,

33:24.437 --> 33:26.830
you've just been
imagining yourself

33:26.874 --> 33:28.963
with a different version of me?

33:29.007 --> 33:31.705
That is not what I said.
That's not what I'm saying.

33:31.748 --> 33:34.055
-Is he... is he here?
-Don't do that.

33:34.099 --> 33:36.231
Is he here now? Oh, you know,
maybe we should just...

33:36.275 --> 33:38.842
we should get him out here.
Hey, let's get Old Toby out here

33:38.886 --> 33:42.237
to join in on this fun! Huh?
Hey, you know...

33:42.281 --> 33:44.109
you know what I'd love
to say to Old Toby, Kate?

33:45.110 --> 33:47.851
He was a mess.

33:47.895 --> 33:51.986
He was miserable
and insecure and self-loathing.

33:52.030 --> 33:54.641
And all-all of that goofiness

33:54.684 --> 33:58.471
and-and the loud jokes--
that was out of self-defense.

33:58.514 --> 34:01.300
Kate, you fell in love
with a coping mechanism.

34:01.343 --> 34:04.651
And FYI, if that guy
hadn't changed,

34:04.694 --> 34:07.306
he would have jumped off a
bridge or died of a heart attack

34:07.349 --> 34:09.090
making a joke
at his own expense.

34:09.134 --> 34:11.092
Wait.
I almost did that last part.

34:15.357 --> 34:18.752
What is so terrible
about me right now?

34:20.145 --> 34:22.538
That I don't want
to dress like a clown?

34:22.582 --> 34:25.063
That I want to buy a nice house
for my family?

34:27.282 --> 34:29.154
I don't know, Toby.

34:29.197 --> 34:30.720
You're just different.

34:32.026 --> 34:34.333
And you're not, Kate?

34:36.335 --> 34:38.119
Why is this conversation
all about me?

34:39.990 --> 34:42.167
When-when...
when we first got together,

34:42.210 --> 34:44.952
it felt like you and me
against the world.

34:44.995 --> 34:48.129
And today, you couldn't go
20 minutes

34:48.173 --> 34:50.175
just us,
without FaceTiming the kids.

34:50.218 --> 34:52.177
After shooting down
an entire day

34:52.220 --> 34:54.614
that I spent weeks planning
for you.

34:54.657 --> 34:56.006
Admit I'm happy?

34:56.050 --> 34:57.921
Kate, what about you?

34:57.965 --> 35:01.360
You love the life
that you are living,

35:01.403 --> 35:05.233
this life that you are building
without me,

35:05.277 --> 35:07.931
where you're the...
you're the working supermom

35:07.975 --> 35:10.369
who gets to live
with her brother again.

35:10.412 --> 35:13.023
You finally get to be
the fully realized

35:13.067 --> 35:15.330
version of yourself,
and all you had to do

35:15.374 --> 35:17.158
was get me out of that house.

35:25.297 --> 35:28.169
When I was younger, I would...

35:28.213 --> 35:30.171
well, I couldn't even think
about the future

35:30.215 --> 35:33.087
because it just was blank.

35:33.131 --> 35:37.047
And... [sighs heavily]

35:37.091 --> 35:39.049
I felt that way for a really...

35:39.093 --> 35:41.226
a long, long time
until I met you.

35:41.269 --> 35:45.795
And you... you took away a lot
of that emptiness.

35:47.275 --> 35:50.974
And so, yeah, Toby,
now I have a full life

35:51.018 --> 35:53.238
that I could have never dreamed.

35:54.674 --> 35:57.764
And I feel healthy,
I feel connected,

35:57.807 --> 36:01.333
I feel like I have a purpose.

36:01.376 --> 36:04.205
I love my life.
I'm-I'm really, really happy.

36:11.604 --> 36:15.347
Except for the one thing that's
making me really, really sad.

36:32.538 --> 36:34.279
Thank you.

36:37.543 --> 36:39.501
We should have talked
about the L.A. offer

36:39.545 --> 36:41.242
even if it wasn't a good one.

36:45.507 --> 36:48.249
We probably
should have also talked

36:48.293 --> 36:50.251
about the fact
that for most of my life,

36:50.295 --> 36:54.473
I have been desperate, desperate
to feel valued at my job,

36:54.516 --> 36:57.302
to not just feel like
I'm taking up space.

36:59.782 --> 37:02.350
I can relate.

37:02.394 --> 37:07.573
And... I'm not just
taking up space here, Kate.

37:08.922 --> 37:11.272
And neither are you.

37:11.316 --> 37:16.408
As wrung out
and as exhausted as I am,

37:16.451 --> 37:19.280
I'm happy for us.

37:19.324 --> 37:21.413
We have both
figured out our worth.

37:23.328 --> 37:25.504
We evolved.

37:25.547 --> 37:28.898
I love you. I love our family.

37:28.942 --> 37:31.901
But there are some real-world
logistics at play here,

37:31.945 --> 37:34.077
and we are gonna have to move
to San Francisco.

37:34.121 --> 37:36.645
That's how these logistics
are gonna play out.

37:36.689 --> 37:39.474
I need you to get on board
because...

37:39.518 --> 37:42.564
moving here is the only way
that we are gonna stay a family.

37:42.608 --> 37:44.566
It is the only option.

37:46.351 --> 37:48.396
[Kate sighs]

37:50.703 --> 37:52.835
I'm gonna go get some air.

37:55.360 --> 37:57.362
Okay.

38:00.016 --> 38:02.280
[door opens]

38:05.021 --> 38:07.328
All right, gang, it's time
to get the hell out of here.

38:07.372 --> 38:08.416
How?

38:10.375 --> 38:11.854
We climb.

38:33.963 --> 38:36.966
Hey, Katie girl, look at me.
Look at me.

38:37.010 --> 38:39.447
I believe you can do it.

38:39.491 --> 38:42.711
Okay, and Mommy,
Randall and Kevin--

38:42.755 --> 38:44.583
they believe you can do it.

38:44.626 --> 38:47.020
Now the only thing
that needs to happen

38:47.063 --> 38:50.240
is that youbelieve
you can do it.

38:52.808 --> 38:54.244
Okay?

39:03.341 --> 39:04.559
I'm gonna go over
to the other side,

39:04.603 --> 39:06.082
and then I'll help you down.

39:08.215 --> 39:10.348
[grunting]

39:15.440 --> 39:16.789
Just...

39:18.617 --> 39:20.314
I'll meet you at the top.

39:27.452 --> 39:31.238
One step at a time, Kate.
No sweat.

39:31.281 --> 39:33.327
[panting]

39:42.467 --> 39:45.252
[breathing deeply]

39:55.480 --> 39:58.483
Okay, Katie girl.
Here's the moment.

39:59.614 --> 40:02.574
Just let go.
Katie, just let go. Let go.

40:02.617 --> 40:05.838
I will never let go, Daddy,
ever!

40:05.881 --> 40:07.100
Yeah? Why not?

40:08.101 --> 40:10.103
Why would I?

40:16.718 --> 40:18.416
RANDALL:
Come on, Kate. Just grab it.

40:20.679 --> 40:22.637
-Guys...
-You got this.

40:22.681 --> 40:24.857
-You got this, Kate.
-You got it.

40:24.900 --> 40:26.467
Okay.

40:31.341 --> 40:33.300
-You got it.
-[grunts]

40:33.343 --> 40:34.475
KEVIN:
You're almost there, Kate.
Let's go.

40:34.519 --> 40:36.521
KEVIN:
Almost there! Oh!

40:36.564 --> 40:38.261
-[gasps, shrieks] No.
-Okay.

40:38.305 --> 40:39.741
-Okay, relax.
-Uh-uh. No.

40:39.785 --> 40:41.526
-We're gonna try it again.
-No, I can't.

40:41.569 --> 40:44.180
I can't, no.

40:44.224 --> 40:45.573
No.

40:52.667 --> 40:54.495
This one.

40:57.193 --> 40:58.717
How'd she do?

40:58.760 --> 41:01.546
[scoffs]
Today is not the day.

41:09.467 --> 41:11.207
[panting]

41:23.263 --> 41:25.395
[laughing]

41:35.014 --> 41:37.407
[line ringing]

41:37.451 --> 41:39.105
PHILLIP:
Hey, Kate. How's Frisco?

41:39.148 --> 41:41.890
Is it foggy and expensive?

41:41.934 --> 41:46.329
Did you, uh,
fill Sheila's job yet?

41:46.373 --> 41:49.202
Uh, no, but we're looking
at applicants.

41:51.596 --> 41:53.380
I'd like to be considered.
