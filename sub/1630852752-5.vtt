17:16.000 --> 17:17.875
[Tuna Sandwich] <i>Erodious.</i>

17:26.541 --> 17:29.375

17:31.791 --> 17:34.416
<i>It healed beings from all over.</i>

17:43.750 --> 17:46.166
<i>Then it was destroyed.</i>

[all gasp]

18:26.416 --> 18:28.916
But there's no trying
to scour the entire galaxy.

18:29.000 --> 18:30.458
You have a better idea?

18:30.541 --> 18:32.250
Portal us out, Jo!

18:32.333 --> 18:34.625
Where? The Earth will still be destroyed.

I've always chalked up
my long healthy life to good luck, but…

19:00.625 --> 19:06.250
looking back, must have been this
Cosmic Healing Stone that's kept me alive.

19:06.333 --> 19:08.916
Papa G, how old are you?

19:09.000 --> 19:10.500
[Papa G] One hundred and eleven.

19:11.875 --> 19:13.458
Nope, one-twelve.

19:13.541 --> 19:17.166
But if that Stone's kept you alive all
this time, what happens if you give it up?

19:18.125 --> 19:20.416
Well, I guess we're gonna find out.
