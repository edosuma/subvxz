IS A DING DONG!

17:59.700 --> 18:02.400
[PHONE HANGS UP]

18:02.900 --> 18:06.867
[CRYING]

18:08.300 --> 18:09.800
[GASPS]

18:09.800 --> 18:11.200
OH, MOSEBY!

18:11.200 --> 18:14.100
I WAS JUST CHECKING
THE CLEAN LINENS.

18:14.100 --> 18:17.500
WHOEVER DOES THE LAUNDRY
SHOULD BE FIRED IMMEDIATELY.

18:17.500 --> 18:21.200
THIS WOULDN'T HAVE TO DO
MORE WITH YOUR FATHER
NOT SHOWING UP

18:21.200 --> 18:23.133
FOR THE FATHER/DAUGHTER
DANCE, WOULD IT?

18:23.133 --> 18:26.200
[VOICE CRACKING]
MAYBE.

18:26.567 --> 18:29.600
I JUST THOUGHT HE MIGHT
ACTUALLY SHOW UP THIS TIME.

18:29.600 --> 18:32.467
MM. I KNOW
JUST HOW YOU FEEL.

18:32.467 --> 18:35.867
IN FACT, IF YOU'RE
NOT DOING ANYTHING,

18:35.867 --> 18:38.800
I WOULD BE HONORED
TO BE YOUR ESCORT

18:38.800 --> 18:40.600
TO THE DANCE
THIS EVENING.

18:40.600 --> 18:43.667
THANK YOU.

18:46.967 --> 18:50.400
YOU <i>ARE </i>GOING
TO CHANGE, RIGHT?

18:51.734 --> 18:55.667
SO...I'M TRYING TO FIT
AN 1/8-INCH WING NUT

18:55.667 --> 18:58.200
ONTO A 2-INCH FLANGE.
CALL ME CRAZY.

18:58.200 --> 19:00.900
YOU'RE A DAREDEVIL!

19:01.400 --> 19:02.400
HOW'S IT GOING?

19:02.400 --> 19:03.767
THIS IS A DISASTER!

19:03.767 --> 19:05.567
ALL HE CAN
TALK ABOUT
IS PLUMBING!

19:05.567 --> 19:08.500
HOW COME HE DIDN'T USE
THE STUFF I WROTE DOWN?!

19:08.500 --> 19:10.600
'CAUSE IT STUNK!

19:10.600 --> 19:12.600
YOU KNOW I CAN
HEAR YOU OVER THERE.

19:12.600 --> 19:14.967
[WHISPERING] I think
our cover is blown.

19:14.967 --> 19:18.133
GREAT,
NOW YOU WHISPER!

19:18.133 --> 19:20.800
ARWIN, MY KIDS
OBVIOUSLY THINK
YOU'RE A GREAT GUY,

19:20.800 --> 19:23.133
SO I FIGURE THEY MUST'VE
TALKED YOU INTO THIS
WHOLE SCHEME?

19:23.133 --> 19:26.400
AND BY THE WAY,
YOU LOOK GREAT.
REALLY.

19:26.400 --> 19:28.500
THANKS.
THANKS.
THANKS.

19:28.500 --> 19:30.700
BUT APPARENTLY
ZACK AND CODY
DON'T LIKE

19:30.700 --> 19:31.767
THE GUY I'M WITH
RIGHT NOW.

19:31.767 --> 19:35.200
THEY SEEM TO THINK
HE ISN'T EXACTLY
TELLING ME THE TRUTH.

19:35.200 --> 19:36.667
[CLEARS THROAT]

19:36.667 --> 19:38.200
ARWIN?
UH...

19:38.200 --> 19:41.033
I'M--I;M THE ONE
WHO HASN'T BEEN
TRUTHFUL.

19:41.033 --> 19:42.767
YOU? ABOUT WHAT?

19:43.000 --> 19:45.667
AS THE WIND WHIPS MY SOUL,
I SHALL NOT TARRY.

19:45.667 --> 19:50.867
TO MY UTTER DESPAIR,
I BID ADIEU TO CAREY.

19:50.867 --> 19:54.100
OH, MY--ARWIN!

19:54.100 --> 19:55.600
IT <i>WAS </i>YOU.

19:55.600 --> 19:58.900
ARWIN, I'M FLATTERED
THAT YOU LIKE ME ENOUGH

19:58.900 --> 20:01.867
TO SEND FLOWERS
AND WRITE BEAUTIFUL POETRY

20:01.867 --> 20:04.500
AND...BATHE, BUT--

20:04.500 --> 20:06.367
BUT?!
NOT THE BUT!

20:06.367 --> 20:07.300
YOU'RE A SWEET GUY,

20:07.300 --> 20:10.300
BUT I DON'T THINK
THIS IS GONNA WORK OUT.

20:10.300 --> 20:12.800
[ALL SIGH]

20:13.033 --> 20:16.467
I SHOULD PROBABLY
STICK TO ADMIRING
FROM AFAR.

20:16.467 --> 20:17.600
IT'S MUCH LESS
PAINFUL

20:17.600 --> 20:21.033
YEAH, BUT NOTHING VENTURED,
NOTHING GAINED.

20:21.033 --> 20:22.700
WHICH IS WHAT
SHE USUALLY SAYS

20:22.700 --> 20:24.734
TO GET US
TO EAT BROCCOLI.

20:24.734 --> 20:27.100
THE POINT IS, JUST 'CAUSE
IT DIDN'T WORK OUT WITH ME

20:27.100 --> 20:29.467
DOESN'T MEAN IT WON'T
WORK OUT WITH SOMEONE ELSE.

20:29.467 --> 20:30.300
THAT'S NICE OF YOU
TO SAY,

20:30.300 --> 20:33.300
BUT I DON'T THINK
IT'LL EVER HAPPEN
FOR ME.

20:33.300 --> 20:37.033
ARWIN...
LOOKIN' GOOD.

20:40.300 --> 20:42.667
NICE PIECE OF BROCCOLI.

20:42.667 --> 20:44.033
NOTHIN' VENTURED...

20:44.033 --> 20:46.100
NOTHING GAINED.
MM-HMM.

20:46.100 --> 20:48.400
HEH HEH HEH HEH.

20:48.400 --> 20:49.367
COME ON, GUYS,

20:49.367 --> 20:50.767
I KNOW YOU
DON'T LIKE SERGE,

20:50.767 --> 20:52.667
BUT I NEED YOU TO TRUST
THAT IF A GUY'S NO GOOD,

20:52.667 --> 20:54.567
I CAN FIGURE IT OUT
ALL BY MYSELF.

20:54.567 --> 20:55.767
BUT YOU DIDN'T
FIGURE OUT

20:55.767 --> 20:57.600
THAT SERGE
WAS A LYING DOOFUS!

20:57.600 --> 20:59.200
NOW, NOW, LET'S NOT
CALL PEOPLE NAMES,

20:59.200 --> 21:01.667
EVEN IF THEY ARE
LYING DOOFUSES.

21:01.667 --> 21:03.767
WE JUST WANTED YOU
TO BE HAPPY.

21:03.767 --> 21:04.734
I AM HAPPY.

21:04.734 --> 21:06.000
THIS WAS OUR
FIRST TIME DATING,

21:06.000 --> 21:07.500
AND NO ONE WAS
SEVERELY INJURED.

21:07.500 --> 21:09.467
I CALL THAT A SUCCESS.

21:10.033 --> 21:12.100
AND IT WAS NICE
GETTING OUT THERE AGAIN.

21:12.100 --> 21:14.867
NOTHING VENTURED...
NOTHING GAINED.

21:14.867 --> 21:17.300
EXACTLY. BROCCOLI?

21:20.600 --> 21:21.467
CAREY,
I'M SO SORRY.

21:21.467 --> 21:23.000
I'VE BEEN RUNNING
ALL OVER TOWN

21:23.000 --> 21:25.700
FOR SOME PRINCESS
BAPA-LAPA
SHAMALAMA DING DONG,

21:25.700 --> 21:28.300
AND IT TURNS OUT
THERE'S NO ONE
AT THE HOTEL

21:28.300 --> 21:29.367
WITH THAT NAME.

21:29.367 --> 21:33.300
THERE'S NO ONE
IN THE WORLD
WITH THAT NAME.

21:33.300 --> 21:35.200
GUYS, GIVE US A MINUTE?

21:36.467 --> 21:41.033
SERGE, YOU KNOW,
THAT POEM YOU WROTE ME
WAS SO LOVELY

21:41.033 --> 21:44.100
I WROTE A LITTLE
SOMETHING FOR YOU.

21:44.100 --> 21:46.834
VIOLETS ARE BLUE,
ROSES ARE RED,

21:46.834 --> 21:51.033
MY BOYS WERE RIGHT--
GO SOAK YOUR HEAD.

21:51.033 --> 21:53.900
YEAH!
YEAH!
