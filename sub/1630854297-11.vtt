WEBVTT

00:15.983 --> 00:18.419
Pep up the step, let's go.

00:20.054 --> 00:21.989
Liam.

00:24.192 --> 00:25.326
Do I know you?

00:25.426 --> 00:27.461
My name's Jamie Reagan.

00:30.198 --> 00:31.965
Officer Jamie Reagan.

00:32.066 --> 00:33.201
Sergeant now, yeah.

00:33.301 --> 00:34.435
I figured you could use a ride

00:34.535 --> 00:35.836
back to the city.

00:35.936 --> 00:37.405
There's no way in hell
I'm catching a ride

00:37.505 --> 00:38.972
with the guy that put me
away in the first place.

00:39.073 --> 00:41.075
I don't see anyone else around
here offering you a ride.

00:42.210 --> 00:43.677
A bus works fine.

00:43.777 --> 00:46.447
Is that bus offering a hot meal
and a couple drinks?

00:47.981 --> 00:49.617
So, come on, you want to ride
that bus

00:49.717 --> 00:52.653
back to the city or hop in?

00:54.021 --> 00:56.056
Come on.

00:58.992 --> 01:01.395
What do we got?
Male, about 60.

01:01.495 --> 01:03.264
Found DOA this morning.

01:03.364 --> 01:05.666
You know those chess hustlers
that hang out around here?
Of course.

01:05.766 --> 01:07.468
Apparently, he
was one of them.

01:07.568 --> 01:09.002
We got a name?
Shawn Hutchins.

01:09.103 --> 01:10.604
According to the guys
that hang around here,

01:10.704 --> 01:12.072
he goes by the
nickname "Shy."

01:12.173 --> 01:14.642
Shy.
Any signs
of a struggle?
None.

01:14.742 --> 01:16.310
All right, we got it from here.

01:16.410 --> 01:17.745
Where is he?
Is that my dad?

01:17.845 --> 01:18.612
Whoa.

01:18.712 --> 01:20.047
Hey, hey.
Who are you?

01:20.148 --> 01:22.015
Eric. Is that my dad?

01:22.116 --> 01:24.084
Please, I got to see him.

01:27.421 --> 01:29.557
Okay.

01:29.657 --> 01:31.792
It's him. Oh, God.

01:31.892 --> 01:32.926
What happened?

01:33.026 --> 01:34.495
We don't know yet.
Was he murdered?

01:34.595 --> 01:35.529
We don't know that either.

01:35.629 --> 01:36.797
Well, he didn't just crawl

01:36.897 --> 01:38.299
into those bushes
and have a heart attack.

01:38.399 --> 01:40.234
Do you know if your
dad ever used drugs?

01:40.334 --> 01:41.602
No, of course not.

01:41.702 --> 01:42.870
Are you sure about that?

01:42.970 --> 01:45.439
Yes. He came here
every day to play chess,

01:45.539 --> 01:47.074
not... shoot heroin.

01:47.175 --> 01:49.042
Can you think of anyone who
would want to hurt your dad?

01:49.143 --> 01:52.580
No. Uh, the way this city
is these days,

01:52.680 --> 01:54.047
could've been anyone.

01:55.082 --> 01:57.385
You got to find
who did this to him.

01:57.485 --> 01:59.220
We'll do our best.

01:59.320 --> 02:00.421
Good to see you.

02:00.521 --> 02:02.290
Thank you so much
for coming.

02:02.390 --> 02:04.325
Come on, I'll see
you next week, okay?

02:04.425 --> 02:05.926
Yes, ma'am. Come on now.

02:06.026 --> 02:07.461
Always styling.
Looking sharp.
Thank you, Pastor.

02:07.561 --> 02:08.762
God bless you,
thank you so much.

02:08.862 --> 02:10.264
Thank you, Pastor.
Excellent sermon.

02:10.364 --> 02:11.532
Talk to you next week. Okay?
All right, sounds good.

02:11.632 --> 02:13.367
Yes, sir. See you.

02:13.467 --> 02:15.603
Madam D.A.

02:15.703 --> 02:19.340
Oh, please, I'm just
a bureau chief, Pastor Clay.

02:19.440 --> 02:20.841
For now.

02:20.941 --> 02:24.011
Well, I-I caught
some of the service.

02:24.111 --> 02:27.014
The sermon and the music
was just beautiful.

02:27.114 --> 02:29.149
Thank you, thank you.
But I can assure

02:29.250 --> 02:31.619
I did not have you come all the
way to Harlem for a compliment.

02:31.719 --> 02:34.087
Walk with me?

02:35.289 --> 02:36.324
I've done my research,
Ms. Reagan.

02:36.424 --> 02:37.825
And I know the one thing

02:37.925 --> 02:42.430
you might value more than
justice and the law is family.

02:43.531 --> 02:45.899
My family needs your help.

02:45.999 --> 02:49.002
Ten months ago,
my nephew Devon was arrested.

02:49.102 --> 02:50.003
For?

02:50.103 --> 02:51.472
The particulars
don't matter.

02:51.572 --> 02:53.407
You'll be able to read
all about it in his file.

02:53.507 --> 02:55.276
What matters is
how the arrest

02:55.376 --> 02:57.345
has been tearing
my family apart.

02:57.445 --> 02:58.779
What are you
asking of me?

02:58.879 --> 03:01.081
To look into it,
give us some clarity.

03:01.181 --> 03:03.584
Clarity? Well, that's
something his defense attorney

03:03.684 --> 03:04.885
should be able to provide.

03:04.985 --> 03:06.987
No, I've asked.
The public defender.

03:07.087 --> 03:09.790
The lawyer we hired
to replace him.

03:09.890 --> 03:12.192
The prosecutor on the case.

03:12.293 --> 03:13.361
Now I'm asking you.

03:13.461 --> 03:16.096
No favors
or preferential treatment.

03:16.196 --> 03:17.631
Just some answers.

03:17.731 --> 03:20.234
And in return, your good deed
won't go unnoticed.

03:20.334 --> 03:22.102
I'm sure you've done
research of your own.

03:22.202 --> 03:23.404
I have, yeah.

03:23.504 --> 03:24.705
And so you know
I shepherd

03:24.805 --> 03:28.108
one of the biggest
congregations in the city.

03:28.208 --> 03:30.244
That comes with
a lot of influence.

03:30.344 --> 03:31.679
You mean voters.

03:31.779 --> 03:33.814
It's not a secret

03:33.914 --> 03:36.016
that you're planning
to run for D.A.

03:36.817 --> 03:40.954
If you can shed some
light on the situation,

03:41.054 --> 03:43.824
I would be more
than appreciative.

03:50.398 --> 03:51.999
Sir, do you have
a minute for Sid?

03:52.099 --> 03:54.302
We already had
our morning briefing.

03:54.402 --> 03:55.603
He say what it's about?

03:55.703 --> 03:58.171
He did not.

03:58.272 --> 04:00.508
He seems a little fidgety.

04:02.075 --> 04:03.511
Oh?

04:04.478 --> 04:07.515
Okay, let's see why.

04:12.420 --> 04:13.554
Hey, Sid.
Hey, boss.

04:13.654 --> 04:15.756
Thanks for seeing me.

04:17.925 --> 04:20.027
By the way, that a new suit?

04:20.127 --> 04:21.529
No.

04:21.629 --> 04:24.465
Oh, well, looks new.

04:24.565 --> 04:26.734
Uh, there's this, uh, thing

04:26.834 --> 04:29.202
I thought maybe you could
help me out with.

04:30.538 --> 04:33.307
It's a woman, actually.

04:33.407 --> 04:35.609
Well, not just a woman,

04:35.709 --> 04:37.711
I mean a detective.

04:37.811 --> 04:40.113
I mean the detective is a woman.

04:41.315 --> 04:43.451
This detective have a name?

04:43.551 --> 04:45.886
Laura Acosta.

04:45.986 --> 04:48.456
I worked with her at the 5-4.

04:48.556 --> 04:51.559
Great detective, tough as nails.

04:51.659 --> 04:54.227
So she's tough as nails and...?

04:54.328 --> 04:57.398
She got hurt on the job
a few years back.

04:57.498 --> 05:00.033
A car crash while
pursuing a perp.

05:00.133 --> 05:02.202
She wakes up in pain
every day now.

05:03.737 --> 05:05.506
I'm sorry to hear that.

05:05.606 --> 05:08.842
Yeah. Thing is,
she needs to retire.

05:08.942 --> 05:11.645
<i>Has</i> to retire,
on account of the pain.

05:14.715 --> 05:16.684
And there it is.

05:17.551 --> 05:20.454
But the medical board
won't give her full disability.

05:20.554 --> 05:23.857
They see her going back to work
as a way of disqualifying her.

05:23.957 --> 05:26.527
Sid, full disability
is only given

05:26.627 --> 05:28.362
under exceptional circumstances.

05:28.462 --> 05:29.597
As you know.

05:29.697 --> 05:31.665
I know, it's like hitting
the lotto.

05:31.765 --> 05:34.935
Six figures a year,
tax-free forever.

05:35.035 --> 05:37.605
But I think this is
one of those circumstances.

05:37.705 --> 05:42.109
And I thought maybe you could
talk to the board on her behalf.

05:45.913 --> 05:48.148
This woman pretty?

05:49.149 --> 05:50.283
Oh, come on.

05:50.384 --> 05:51.719
It's a simple question.

05:51.819 --> 05:55.055
Well, you know, she's easy
on the eyes, yeah.

05:55.155 --> 05:57.958
And just how well
did you know her?

05:58.058 --> 06:01.962
No, no, y-you got it
all wrong, boss, I swear.

06:02.062 --> 06:04.031
Well, then set me straight.

06:06.066 --> 06:07.868
I knew this was a bad idea.

06:07.968 --> 06:10.938
What was a bad idea?

06:13.040 --> 06:17.177
The thing is, the ask
isn't coming from me.

06:18.879 --> 06:22.015
It's coming from Danny Reagan.

07:05.158 --> 07:06.994
This can't be it.

07:07.094 --> 07:08.428
It is.

07:08.529 --> 07:09.463
When I lived here,

07:09.563 --> 07:11.565
this was a liquor store

07:11.665 --> 07:14.167
with bulletproof glass
so thick I had to

07:14.267 --> 07:15.903
yell to get Four Lokos.

07:16.003 --> 07:19.272
Now it's... a gin shop?

07:19.372 --> 07:21.274
Tasting room.

07:21.374 --> 07:23.310
That's even worse.

07:23.410 --> 07:24.678
The neon sign,

07:24.778 --> 07:26.914
the flowers.

07:27.715 --> 07:30.484
Is there someplace else
that I can take you?

07:33.220 --> 07:38.058
So, first you put me away and
now you want to be my chauffeur?

07:38.158 --> 07:39.326
I'm not a charity
case, you know.

07:39.426 --> 07:41.194
I know you're not
a charity case.

07:41.294 --> 07:43.564
But between
you and me...

07:43.664 --> 07:44.998
I always felt
like the sentencing

07:45.098 --> 07:48.335
that you got was harsher
than what you deserved.

07:48.435 --> 07:50.738
You and me both.

07:50.838 --> 07:53.874
I was a rookie cop, you
were one of my first collars.

07:53.974 --> 07:55.809
Second-degree robbery.

07:55.909 --> 07:58.345
So you want a prize?

07:58.445 --> 07:59.613
You were this close
to cooperating

07:59.713 --> 08:02.182
with the investigation.

08:02.282 --> 08:04.184
I should've made sure that
you went through with it.

08:04.284 --> 08:05.886
But instead...

08:05.986 --> 08:10.123
I stood back as you got
railroaded by the prosecutor.

08:10.223 --> 08:12.760
Ten years for being a lookout,
I should've said something.

08:12.860 --> 08:15.162
And instead you racked up
the promotions

08:15.262 --> 08:17.430
while I rotted away
behind bars.

08:17.531 --> 08:19.366
"Rotted away"? You ran
the biggest card game

08:19.466 --> 08:20.467
on your cell block.

08:20.568 --> 08:22.002
And I have it on good authority

08:22.102 --> 08:23.737
that you traded more resources
than the commissary.

08:23.837 --> 08:25.372
Some would say
you ran the place.

08:25.472 --> 08:26.840
Were you keeping tabs on me?

08:26.940 --> 08:28.576
Actually, I was.

08:29.610 --> 08:31.912
So, how about a drink?

08:32.012 --> 08:34.114
Where
you running to, Harry Potter?

08:34.214 --> 08:36.984
You can't move there.

08:37.084 --> 08:39.486
Nope, can't hide there either.

08:43.490 --> 08:44.825
Gotcha.

08:44.925 --> 08:47.360
You played too timid,
you got to take more chances.

08:47.460 --> 08:48.361
I'll see you next time.

08:48.461 --> 08:50.530
All right?

08:50.631 --> 08:52.866
Mind if we get next game?

08:52.966 --> 08:54.267
Have a seat.

08:54.367 --> 08:56.369
Thank you.
So you must be

08:56.469 --> 08:58.538
the legendary Saint Nick.
That's right.

08:58.639 --> 09:00.841
Heard you're the one
who found Shawn's body.

09:00.941 --> 09:01.675
Shy's?

09:01.775 --> 09:03.143
Yes, Shy. Yeah.

09:03.243 --> 09:04.444
It was horrible.

09:04.544 --> 09:07.014
You notice anything
unusual before that?

09:07.114 --> 09:08.481
Other than the body? No.

09:08.582 --> 09:10.083
You seem like
the mayor around here.

09:10.183 --> 09:12.552
Do you know if anybody else
maybe saw something?

09:12.653 --> 09:15.689
Look, Shy got that nickname
for a reason.

09:15.789 --> 09:17.958
He never talked to nobody.

09:18.058 --> 09:19.559
Even the people
he played against.

09:19.660 --> 09:20.994
Hell, I don't even think
he talked

09:21.094 --> 09:23.363
to own son for,
I don't know, years.

09:23.463 --> 09:24.765
He and Eric didn't talk?

09:24.865 --> 09:27.701
No, they was on bad terms.
How bad?

09:27.801 --> 09:30.470
What I hear, Shy wrote
him out of his will.

09:30.570 --> 09:31.471
Really?

09:31.571 --> 09:32.873
That's right.

09:32.973 --> 09:34.842
So when I tell you
that no one really knew

09:34.942 --> 09:37.544
what was going on with him,
that is the truth.

09:37.645 --> 09:41.081
No one saw anything,
no one knows anything.

09:41.181 --> 09:42.549
Okay.

09:42.650 --> 09:44.217
And that's all
I got to say to you.

09:47.420 --> 09:48.956
We'll play you next time.

09:49.056 --> 09:50.724
Mm-hmm.

09:52.525 --> 09:54.194
Detective Acosta, sir.

10:03.503 --> 10:04.872
Commissioner.

10:04.972 --> 10:06.473
Thank you for the invitation.

10:06.573 --> 10:08.508
Thanks for coming up.
Please have a seat.

10:08.608 --> 10:10.343
Lieutenant.

10:10.443 --> 10:11.712
Hey, Laura.

10:29.930 --> 10:31.699
So...

10:33.200 --> 10:34.935
23 years on the job,

10:35.035 --> 10:37.637
made detective five years
out of the academy,

10:37.738 --> 10:41.909
Detective First Grade
ten years after that...

10:42.009 --> 10:45.645
with a pile of commendations
along the way. Well done.

10:45.746 --> 10:47.915
Got lucky with some
good partners, sir.

10:50.483 --> 10:52.886
Could you walk us
through what happened?

10:52.986 --> 10:56.223
Well, I could limp you
through what happened.

10:56.323 --> 10:57.925
She's still got it.

10:59.392 --> 11:02.462
We were pursuing a perp
Queens-bound on the BQE.

11:02.562 --> 11:04.531
When I hit the
lights, he gunned it

11:04.631 --> 11:06.066
and swerved in front
of a tractor trailer.

11:06.166 --> 11:08.035
The truck driver
reacted and turned

11:08.135 --> 11:11.371
into us, sandwiching us between
the truck and the median.

11:11.471 --> 11:13.673
My partner walked
away from it.

11:13.774 --> 11:17.077
But for me it was six months
before I walked again.

11:17.177 --> 11:20.680
And six more months before
I returned to full duty.

11:21.648 --> 11:23.250
And how is the pain now?

11:23.350 --> 11:27.487
Some days bad, some days worse.

11:28.789 --> 11:31.091
I never wanted to retire
this young, but...

11:31.191 --> 11:36.997
even sitting at the desk for
a full tour has become too much.

11:38.398 --> 11:39.867
Sorry to hear that.

11:40.633 --> 11:44.604
Commissioner, can I ask what,
what exactly we're doing here?

11:46.807 --> 11:49.676
Well, you sacrificed
for this department.

11:49.777 --> 11:51.211
I wanted to hear how.

11:51.311 --> 11:54.214
How or how much?

11:55.415 --> 11:57.184
Just how.

11:57.951 --> 12:01.654
You meet with every detective
who gets injured on the job?

12:04.091 --> 12:06.326
Look, this may be out of line.

12:06.426 --> 12:08.295
If it is,
you don't have to answer.

12:08.395 --> 12:10.798
Um...

12:10.898 --> 12:13.233
How well do you know
Detective Reagan?

12:13.333 --> 12:17.570
We've been in the same squad
for the last ten years,

12:17.670 --> 12:21.241
so... pretty well.

12:21.341 --> 12:24.978
I figured it was his guilt
that brought me in here.

12:27.314 --> 12:28.615
What's that mean?

12:29.616 --> 12:33.353
I covered some of Danny's cases
and picked up some of his tours

12:33.453 --> 12:37.090
when he was taking time
after his wife died.

12:38.058 --> 12:43.063
The case I was on the night of
the accident was actually his.

12:45.132 --> 12:48.735
I never blamed him
for a second, but...

12:48.836 --> 12:51.972
I think he always
blamed himself.

12:56.643 --> 13:01.314
So, we spoke to a few of the
chess players at the park.

13:01.414 --> 13:04.551
They told us you haven't
spoken to your dad in years.

13:04.651 --> 13:08.155
Yeah. Seven years at least.

13:08.255 --> 13:09.322
That's a long time.

13:09.422 --> 13:11.291
You two must've had
a real falling out.

13:11.391 --> 13:13.961
Yeah. Yeah, we grew
apart, I guess.

13:14.061 --> 13:16.263
Is that your way of saying that
he wrote you out of his will?

13:16.363 --> 13:18.231
Wait, how did you know
about that?

13:18.331 --> 13:20.500
Well, the chess players
didn't tell us much,

13:20.600 --> 13:22.035
but they told
us that much.

13:22.135 --> 13:24.204
So, what?
That makes me a suspect?

13:24.304 --> 13:26.073
Not necessarily,
but you did show up

13:26.173 --> 13:27.908
to the crime scene
kind of quick

13:28.008 --> 13:29.809
for someone who's not been
in touch for all these years.

13:29.910 --> 13:31.411
One of the guys called me.

13:31.511 --> 13:32.779
Look...

13:32.880 --> 13:35.215
my dad and I had
our differences,

13:35.315 --> 13:36.583
but he was still my dad.

13:36.683 --> 13:38.385
So, what happened
to you two?

13:38.485 --> 13:40.420
He was an immigrant.

13:40.520 --> 13:42.255
And very religious.

13:42.355 --> 13:43.523
I grew up a New Yorker.

13:43.623 --> 13:45.058
When I started
living with my wife

13:45.158 --> 13:46.826
before we were
married, he lost it.

13:46.927 --> 13:51.331
Said all sorts of stuff
about her, and me.

13:51.431 --> 13:52.799
Said we were going to hell.

13:52.900 --> 13:55.135
And the two of you never
tried to reconcile things?

13:55.235 --> 13:56.970
He tried.

13:57.070 --> 14:00.173
He started writing letters
to me a few years back.

14:00.273 --> 14:01.474
I never read 'em.

14:01.574 --> 14:04.377
But you never threw 'em out
either, did you?

14:06.313 --> 14:08.848
Eric, would you mind if we took
a look at the letters?

14:24.831 --> 14:26.266
You sure you don't want
to read them first?

14:26.366 --> 14:29.002
What I want is to help
find who did this.

14:29.102 --> 14:30.370
Okay.

14:30.470 --> 14:32.605
You said those guys in the park
weren't talking?

14:32.705 --> 14:33.806
Right.
Let me try.

14:33.907 --> 14:35.275
No. No way.

14:35.375 --> 14:37.744
I've known them
since I was a kid.

14:37.844 --> 14:39.446
We still speak
the same language.

14:39.546 --> 14:41.048
I can help.

14:41.148 --> 14:43.383
Please.

14:51.558 --> 14:54.194
You want to tell me what's going
on with Devon Clay?

14:54.294 --> 14:58.065
I met his uncle and he thinks
the case is being mishandled.

14:58.165 --> 15:00.000
Pastor Clay's a powerful guy.

15:00.100 --> 15:01.668
You're trying to get
on his good side?

15:01.768 --> 15:02.902
What makes you say that?

15:03.003 --> 15:04.104
'Cause you're not the only one.

15:04.204 --> 15:06.073
I went to pull
the case file

15:06.173 --> 15:08.208
and I saw that someone
beat me to it.

15:08.308 --> 15:09.809
Who?

15:09.909 --> 15:12.212
Manhattan District Attorney
Kimberly Crawford,

15:12.312 --> 15:16.183
aka your soon-to-be
opponent for D.A.

15:16.283 --> 15:18.385
So, whatever game
you're playing,

15:18.485 --> 15:20.020
she's playing it, too.

15:20.120 --> 15:22.289
What can I get you?

15:24.024 --> 15:25.225
A Vesper martini.

15:25.325 --> 15:27.094
Shaken, not stirred.

15:27.194 --> 15:28.861
Same.

15:29.729 --> 15:30.830
Bond martini? Really?

15:30.930 --> 15:31.864
Bond movies were my favorite

15:31.965 --> 15:34.401
to watch on movie nights inside.

15:34.501 --> 15:35.702
I always wanted to try one.

15:35.802 --> 15:37.204
All right.

15:37.304 --> 15:41.208
So, who is this really about?

15:41.308 --> 15:44.311
Washington, Russo or Marshall?

15:44.411 --> 15:45.578
Who said anything
about those...?

15:45.678 --> 15:47.114
My gut.

15:51.484 --> 15:52.919
Russo.

15:53.020 --> 15:54.954
I'm no snitch.

15:58.291 --> 15:59.292
What's wrong?

15:59.392 --> 16:00.727
That ain't right.

16:00.827 --> 16:02.195
Too much vermouth,

16:02.295 --> 16:04.464
not enough vodka,
and no gin whatsoever.

16:05.198 --> 16:07.100
I've seen my fair share
of Bond movies.

16:07.200 --> 16:10.770
Hey, excuse me.
Uh, this drink's wrong.

16:10.870 --> 16:12.405
It's a martini.

16:12.505 --> 16:13.773
We ordered the Vesper.

16:13.873 --> 16:16.209
Yeah, the Bond martini, it ain't
on the menu.

16:16.309 --> 16:17.844
Well, you should've told me that
when I ordered it.

16:17.944 --> 16:19.379
Well, I'm telling you now.

16:20.480 --> 16:21.581
Hey, hey.
We got a problem here?

16:21.681 --> 16:23.050
No, no, there's no problem.

16:24.484 --> 16:25.952
We just want you
to make the drink.

16:26.053 --> 16:27.687
Sit down or I'm gonna
call the police.

16:27.787 --> 16:30.557
Hey, I am the police.

16:33.226 --> 16:35.928
So, can you make
the drink or not?

16:45.438 --> 16:46.839
I can handle myself.

16:46.939 --> 16:48.875
I know you can, but you're
not on the inside anymore.

16:48.975 --> 16:49.976
You think
I don't know that?

16:50.077 --> 16:51.378
Then act like it.

16:51.478 --> 16:53.380
And have a little
faith in simple favors.

17:01.554 --> 17:02.455
I need to
speak with you.

17:02.555 --> 17:03.656
I have exactly one minute

17:03.756 --> 17:05.558
before my next meeting. Uh...

17:05.658 --> 17:09.028
I need the Devon Clay
case file.

17:09.129 --> 17:10.597
Doesn't ring a bell.

17:10.697 --> 17:13.433
Pastor Clay's
nephew, of Harlem.

17:13.533 --> 17:15.135
The Lenox Tabernacle.

17:16.136 --> 17:17.537
Is that so?

17:17.637 --> 17:19.439
Are you really gonna pretend
like you don't know?

17:19.539 --> 17:21.040
What are you doing, Erin?

17:21.141 --> 17:22.842
I'm looking for answers.

17:22.942 --> 17:24.511
Not here.

17:24.611 --> 17:26.579
Then where?
Because you have ignored

17:26.679 --> 17:28.081
my last three phone calls.

17:28.181 --> 17:30.049
I mean, what the hell
is going on here?

17:32.119 --> 17:33.853
What's going on...

17:33.953 --> 17:35.688
is that you've made me
late for my meeting

17:35.788 --> 17:38.158
with the mayor's office.

17:46.699 --> 17:47.700
Mind if I play?

17:47.800 --> 17:49.836
Sure, five bucks, five minutes.

17:49.936 --> 17:52.539
You want white or... black?

17:52.639 --> 17:54.507
I'll take black.

17:54.607 --> 17:57.410
I think you'll need
the advantage.

17:57.510 --> 18:01.514
Wow. Eric.

18:01.614 --> 18:03.116
It's been years.

18:03.216 --> 18:04.751
We thought we'd bring
a more worthy opponent

18:04.851 --> 18:06.753
for a man of your skill set.

18:07.620 --> 18:08.755
These detectives say
you know something about

18:08.855 --> 18:10.323
what happened to my father.

18:10.423 --> 18:12.492
That's funny 'cause I told 'em
I didn't know a thing.

18:12.592 --> 18:13.726
You can lie to
us all you want,

18:13.826 --> 18:14.661
but you're really
gonna sit here

18:14.761 --> 18:16.028
and lie to Shy's son?

18:17.164 --> 18:18.598
Come on, Nick.

18:18.698 --> 18:21.668
If you saw something,
you got to tell me, please.

18:21.768 --> 18:22.735
You're gonna end up getting
somebody else killed,

18:22.835 --> 18:24.171
you know that, right?

18:24.271 --> 18:26.606
Not if you can help us
find whoever did this.

18:32.812 --> 18:36.649
There's been a gang...
hanging in the park recently.

18:36.749 --> 18:37.817
Ace Double Treys.

18:37.917 --> 18:39.319
Shook down one
of the guys last week.

18:39.419 --> 18:40.587
And I seen 'em
out here dealing

18:40.687 --> 18:42.289
more and more frequently.

18:42.389 --> 18:44.157
Shy have any run-ins with them?

18:46.058 --> 18:49.128
Yes. Used to hang out
with one of 'em.

18:49.229 --> 18:50.163
What?

18:50.263 --> 18:51.231
What do you mean by hanging out?

18:51.331 --> 18:52.665
Talk and play chess.

18:52.765 --> 18:54.167
He was the only guy
Shy would talk to,

18:54.267 --> 18:55.468
or else I wouldn't have noticed.

18:55.568 --> 18:57.404
My dad didn't consort
with gangbangers.

18:57.504 --> 18:59.005
How would you know?

19:00.373 --> 19:01.608
Now, I've given you all I got.

19:01.708 --> 19:03.042
No, you haven't.

19:03.142 --> 19:05.512
We need a name
and/or a description.

19:05.612 --> 19:07.447
If they find out
I been snitching,

19:07.547 --> 19:08.715
I'm gonna end up like Shy.

19:08.815 --> 19:11.284
So don't say another word to us.

19:11.384 --> 19:13.620
Just talk to Eric.

19:17.790 --> 19:19.959
Finally gonna tell me
what the hell is going on?

19:20.059 --> 19:22.229
You should know better
than to try to have

19:22.329 --> 19:25.632
that kind of conversation
in the middle of the bullpen.

19:27.667 --> 19:30.537
Pastor Clay offer you
his endorsement?

19:31.871 --> 19:33.906
He offered me one, too.

19:34.006 --> 19:35.141
Smart move.

19:35.242 --> 19:37.510
He's playing us
against each other.

19:37.610 --> 19:41.348
That could be so, but no more
talking about this in public.

19:41.448 --> 19:43.250
Unless you want to sink
both of our prospects

19:43.350 --> 19:44.651
of getting elected.

19:46.152 --> 19:47.687
So now what?

19:47.787 --> 19:50.122
Is it "may the best woman win"?

19:50.223 --> 19:52.525
Or are we gonna
actually work together

19:52.625 --> 19:54.627
and find justice for Devon?

20:00.767 --> 20:03.002
Man, stepping to me,

20:03.102 --> 20:05.505
talking about who killed
his father, whoopty-whoo.

20:05.605 --> 20:08.608
He ain't even talked
to his father for years.

20:08.708 --> 20:10.510
You know what
I'm saying? Like...

20:10.610 --> 20:12.612
Damien Richards.

20:12.712 --> 20:14.180
And who are you?

20:14.281 --> 20:16.883
Detective Reagan. This is
my partner Detective Baez.

20:16.983 --> 20:18.951
Some very nice colors
you gentlemen have on.

20:19.051 --> 20:20.420
Hmm.
Aren't those
the same colors

20:20.520 --> 20:22.489
used by the Ace Double Treys?

20:22.589 --> 20:23.556
Ace Treys?

20:23.656 --> 20:24.624
Yeah.

20:24.724 --> 20:27.294
Nah, we're more like a, um...

20:27.394 --> 20:28.428
a men's group.

20:28.528 --> 20:29.529
A men's group?

20:29.629 --> 20:31.364
You know, like drum circles

20:31.464 --> 20:33.099
and talking about our
feelings, you know?
Mm-hmm.

20:33.199 --> 20:34.434
That sort of thing.

20:34.534 --> 20:35.535
So you don't happen
to know anything about

20:35.635 --> 20:36.836
the death of Shawn Hutchins?

20:36.936 --> 20:38.037
Who?

20:38.137 --> 20:39.572
Shawn Hutchins,
also known as Shy.

20:39.672 --> 20:41.508
Shy.

20:41.608 --> 20:42.675
Yeah.

20:42.775 --> 20:44.076
Hey, you know what?
I did know Shy.

20:44.176 --> 20:45.478
He actually helped me out
with my chess game,

20:45.578 --> 20:47.179
he was a really good dude.

20:47.280 --> 20:49.181
I mean, I don't know
who killed him, though.

20:49.282 --> 20:51.418
But someone did kill him.
Is that what you're saying?

20:51.518 --> 20:53.152
Just a guess.

20:53.252 --> 20:56.956
So you two hung out
and played chess, is that it?

20:57.056 --> 21:00.827
I picked up the game when I was
serving a little time upstate.

21:00.927 --> 21:04.831
So I wanted to get better
at it, and then Shy, he...

21:04.931 --> 21:06.833
I think he just wanted
somebody to talk to.

21:06.933 --> 21:08.200
What'd you talk about?

21:08.301 --> 21:09.669
His son.

21:09.769 --> 21:11.671
You know, I'm guessing
it's just 'cause me and him

21:11.771 --> 21:13.473
were around the same age.

21:13.573 --> 21:15.742
But that dude Eric was nothing
like his father said he was.

21:15.842 --> 21:18.678
Hold on, you... you've met Eric?

21:18.778 --> 21:20.713
Yeah, he came around here
asking questions.

21:20.813 --> 21:21.981
How'd that go?

21:22.081 --> 21:24.050
Well, his dad thought
he was so smart.

21:24.150 --> 21:27.053
Truth is, he was really lucky
that me and my boys understand

21:27.153 --> 21:30.757
that family can make
you act stupid.

21:30.857 --> 21:33.292
But he might not be
so lucky next time.

21:33.393 --> 21:35.061
That a threat?

21:37.330 --> 21:38.431
It's the truth.

21:39.399 --> 21:42.101
Now, if you want anything else,
call my lawyer.

21:42.201 --> 21:43.703
Okay.

21:43.803 --> 21:45.905
We'll let you get back
to your men's group.

21:53.413 --> 21:55.114
Thank you.

22:00.820 --> 22:02.755
Hey.
Hey.

22:02.855 --> 22:05.958
What are we doing here?

22:07.226 --> 22:09.128
Can't a father buy
his soon a beer?

22:09.228 --> 22:12.899
Eh, not this particular father,
this last-minute.

22:14.133 --> 22:16.669
Sid Gormley came to me
for a favor.

22:16.769 --> 22:19.338
Ah. Yeah.

22:20.206 --> 22:22.274
Just trying to do
a good cop a solid, Dad.

22:22.375 --> 22:25.111
There's no trap doors here,
it just is what it is.

22:25.211 --> 22:28.581
Yeah, well, why didn't you
come to me directly?

22:28.681 --> 22:30.983
You kind of have
a very clear policy

22:31.083 --> 22:32.619
against any kind of hook
for any of us.

22:32.719 --> 22:36.423
Well, making Sid your beard
isn't much of a workaround.

22:36.523 --> 22:39.058
No, never had
a good poker face, did he?

22:39.158 --> 22:43.730
Yeah. Hope you didn't
pay him up front.

22:43.830 --> 22:45.798
Look, whatever policy
you think stands

22:45.898 --> 22:49.569
never means that I don't want to
have the conversation with you.

22:49.669 --> 22:52.038
Okay.

22:52.138 --> 22:54.741
So let's have it. Can you make
this happen for her?

22:54.841 --> 22:56.743
What's this? A do-over?

22:56.843 --> 22:59.412
Yeah. I'm taking a mulligan.

23:00.513 --> 23:02.449
Doesn't work that way.

23:03.883 --> 23:06.453
You know, I don't think...

23:06.553 --> 23:10.056
I've ever heard you
mention her before.

23:10.957 --> 23:12.759
She never came up before.

23:15.161 --> 23:18.765
Do you know she thinks you blame
yourself for her accident?

23:18.865 --> 23:20.266
Yeah.

23:20.366 --> 23:25.004
And I may blame myself for a lot
of things, but not that.

23:26.673 --> 23:29.408
There was, uh...

23:31.143 --> 23:34.747
There was a lot of things
going on back then

23:34.847 --> 23:36.983
with Linda and the boys. Yeah.

23:37.083 --> 23:39.952
It's all in
the rearview now, Dad.

23:41.153 --> 23:44.023
Detective Costa, too?

23:45.925 --> 23:48.628
Laura was there for me.

23:48.728 --> 23:51.864
As a friend and as a fellow
detective when Linda died.

23:51.964 --> 23:53.766
There was nothing more to it.

23:53.866 --> 23:55.868
Danny, I'm not saying there was.

23:59.939 --> 24:01.107
I'm just...

24:01.207 --> 24:03.710
trying to do a good cop a solid.

24:03.810 --> 24:06.412
Well, and I believe you 100%.

24:09.381 --> 24:12.885
You, me and Pop...

24:12.985 --> 24:14.821
we have a lot of things
in common

24:14.921 --> 24:16.489
that we worked hard
to make stick.

24:16.589 --> 24:18.424
Mm-hmm.

24:18.525 --> 24:21.494
But one thing...

24:21.594 --> 24:23.863
just...

24:23.963 --> 24:26.933
happened to all three of us.

24:27.033 --> 24:30.302
We lost our wives way too soon.

24:32.572 --> 24:34.473
Yeah.

24:38.110 --> 24:40.146
Me and Pop, we...

24:40.246 --> 24:43.415
Well, we made our peace, but...

24:43.516 --> 24:45.552
you were way younger.

24:50.790 --> 24:54.426
Maybe don't follow
our footsteps that way.

25:08.808 --> 25:10.577
What the hell
are you thinking?

25:11.443 --> 25:14.313
You went and confronted the
Ace Double Treys on your own?

25:14.413 --> 25:15.815
You trying to get
yourself killed?

25:15.915 --> 25:17.717
I had to know if my dad
had fallen so low

25:17.817 --> 25:19.385
as to deal
with criminals.

25:19.485 --> 25:21.688
When we gave you a green light
to come to the park with us,

25:21.788 --> 25:24.123
it wasn't a green light to go
investigating yourself.

25:24.223 --> 25:26.225
You don't get what it's like
to lose someone like this.

25:26.325 --> 25:27.927
Yes, I do.

25:29.161 --> 25:30.529
Look...

25:30.630 --> 25:32.699
I know when you lose
someone unexpectedly,

25:32.799 --> 25:35.534
there's a lot of things
you want to go back and say.

25:35.635 --> 25:36.936
But you can't.

25:39.205 --> 25:40.707
Your father wouldn't
want this for you.

25:40.807 --> 25:42.609
And he certainly wouldn't
want you to end up dead.

25:42.709 --> 25:45.678
I just lost it.

25:45.778 --> 25:47.446
We had our differences,
but I never thought

25:47.546 --> 25:49.816
he would end up hanging
with guys like that.

25:49.916 --> 25:51.651
I mean, my dad, a criminal.

25:51.751 --> 25:53.352
We don't know that. Please.

25:53.452 --> 25:54.587
He starts hanging
with gangbangers,

25:54.687 --> 25:56.188
next thing you know he's gone?

25:56.288 --> 25:57.489
It's obviously connected.

25:57.590 --> 25:59.058
Well, if it is,
we'll find out how.

25:59.158 --> 26:00.660
In the meantime,

26:00.760 --> 26:03.062
you need to stay out of the
way and let me do my job.

26:04.296 --> 26:06.032
Okay?

26:07.399 --> 26:09.736
Look, for whatever's it's worth,

26:09.836 --> 26:12.271
you should know that
your old man really loved you.

26:14.206 --> 26:15.141
You read those letters?

26:15.241 --> 26:17.209
Yes.
And?

26:17.309 --> 26:18.277
Did you find anything?

26:18.377 --> 26:19.511
I didn't find anything

26:19.612 --> 26:21.147
that could help us
with the case,

26:21.247 --> 26:25.117
but maybe there's something
in there that can help you.

26:25.217 --> 26:26.518
You should read them.

26:27.453 --> 26:28.688
Won't matter.

26:28.788 --> 26:29.555
Why?

26:29.656 --> 26:32.591
Because it's too late.

26:34.861 --> 26:37.096
Late last year, a man was
attacked on the subway

26:37.196 --> 26:38.631
by a group of kids.

26:38.731 --> 26:39.966
Aside from the victim,

26:40.066 --> 26:42.401
there were no witnesses,
surveillance or leads.

26:42.501 --> 26:43.836
Until, of course,
when Devon Clay

26:43.936 --> 26:46.338
walked into a precinct
and made a confession.

26:46.438 --> 26:47.840
What else do you have?

26:49.341 --> 26:50.643
Tell us what
you got first.

26:50.743 --> 26:52.111
What, you don't trust me?

26:54.580 --> 26:56.849
Fine.

26:56.949 --> 26:59.451
As you know, Devon was
a first-time offender.

26:59.551 --> 27:02.588
My investigator and I spoke
with members of the community.

27:02.689 --> 27:05.692
They all agree Devon was--
is-- a good kid.

27:05.792 --> 27:08.327
So, you got nothing that
wasn't in the case file?

27:08.427 --> 27:10.329
I reinterviewed the victim.

27:10.429 --> 27:14.100
He said Devon was on the
sidelines for the entire attack.

27:14.200 --> 27:15.634
Apparently in tears.

27:15.735 --> 27:18.838
Well, that's contrary
to what was first reported.

27:20.039 --> 27:24.343
We spoke with the detective
that took his confession.

27:24.443 --> 27:27.113
It was a win for them,
so they never looked back.

27:27.213 --> 27:28.915
Their interrogation questions
were a joke.

27:29.015 --> 27:31.050
They didn't even press the kid
to give up his friends.

27:31.150 --> 27:33.820
Then maybe we should.

27:34.586 --> 27:36.689
Press Devon to give up his crew.

27:36.789 --> 27:39.058
Do you want to play
good cop or bad cop?

27:39.158 --> 27:41.694
I got an idea
which one she'll pick.

27:42.929 --> 27:44.897
I guess I'll see you
at Rikers then.

27:47.099 --> 27:49.501
You've been here
for six months, Devon.

27:50.502 --> 27:51.470
It's time you tell the truth.

27:51.570 --> 27:53.272
I'm not interested.

27:53.372 --> 27:55.441
Come on, kid. This is
your chance to come clean.

27:55.541 --> 27:56.608
And if you don't,

27:56.709 --> 27:57.710
my office will throw
the book at you.

27:57.810 --> 27:58.745
And that's a promise.

27:58.845 --> 28:01.280
Then do it. I'm not scared.

28:01.380 --> 28:03.883
You know, we've asked around.

28:03.983 --> 28:07.186
We know that you've been running
around with a different crowd.

28:07.286 --> 28:08.687
Your mother said

28:08.788 --> 28:10.757
that these kids didn't go
to high school with you.

28:10.857 --> 28:12.658
I'm allowed to have friends.

28:12.759 --> 28:15.127
Are your new friends
part of a gang?

28:16.295 --> 28:17.730
You're a bad liar,
you know that?

28:17.830 --> 28:19.365
That assault looked
a lot like

28:19.465 --> 28:20.767
a gang initiation.

28:20.867 --> 28:23.870
And if it was, we're gonna
add gang assault

28:23.970 --> 28:26.138
to your current charges.
That's five more years.

28:26.238 --> 28:27.774
Five more?

28:27.874 --> 28:30.209
Unless you tell us
exactly what happened.

28:31.577 --> 28:33.512
Even the victim said
you were in tears

28:33.612 --> 28:35.714
at the scene.
We know you regret this.

28:35.815 --> 28:38.550
Tell us what really happened.

28:41.587 --> 28:43.289
They told me...

28:43.389 --> 28:46.725
we were just gonna record
a few pranks for TikTok.

28:46.826 --> 28:48.995
Who did? Give us names.

28:49.095 --> 28:50.396
I can't.

28:50.496 --> 28:52.498
Did they threaten you?

28:52.598 --> 28:53.966
Your family?

28:55.334 --> 28:57.103
My little brother.

28:58.404 --> 28:59.605
We can protect him.

28:59.705 --> 29:02.374
Okay? It's not too late, Devon.

29:02.474 --> 29:04.877
Let us help you.

29:05.677 --> 29:07.113
Great job.

29:07.213 --> 29:08.848
Told you I know my way
around a car.

29:08.948 --> 29:12.318
Let's check out a later model.

29:12.418 --> 29:14.787
This one runs by computers.

29:14.887 --> 29:16.588
Why don't you go ahead
and plug it in?

29:16.688 --> 29:18.257
I got this.
Mm-hmm.

29:30.602 --> 29:31.537
A lot-- a lot has changed...

29:31.637 --> 29:34.306
Since what? I got locked up?

29:34.406 --> 29:35.774
I can figure this out.

29:35.875 --> 29:36.775
Well, let me help you.

29:36.876 --> 29:38.477
I'm not stupid.

29:38.577 --> 29:39.846
We didn't say you were.

29:39.946 --> 29:41.280
Then why do you keep talking
to me like I am?

29:41.380 --> 29:42.214
Liam, we're just...

29:42.314 --> 29:44.250
Hey, I got this.

29:45.717 --> 29:47.219
Hey.

29:52.391 --> 29:55.161
I'm really sorry, I...

29:55.261 --> 29:56.628
I really need your help.

29:57.796 --> 29:59.431
He's a good guy.

29:59.531 --> 30:01.200
I can vouch for him, trust me.

30:02.634 --> 30:03.669
I'll give him a shot.

30:03.769 --> 30:05.137
I got the job?

30:05.237 --> 30:06.405
Apprenticeship.

30:06.505 --> 30:08.240
That's a start.

30:31.097 --> 30:32.731
Well, I had that
drink with Danny

30:32.831 --> 30:33.900
the other night.

30:34.000 --> 30:35.968
So? What'd he say?

30:36.068 --> 30:37.069
Well, you know him.

30:37.169 --> 30:39.071
Not much
you can pin him down on.

30:40.639 --> 30:42.708
Did you expect him
to open up about his love life?

30:42.808 --> 30:45.344
No, not at all.

30:45.444 --> 30:47.313
So what's
bothering you?

30:48.314 --> 30:49.882
Come on.

30:49.982 --> 30:51.984
I've known you since
the day you were born.

30:52.084 --> 30:54.853
I guess maybe what
I said to him.

30:54.954 --> 30:56.956
You guess? Maybe?

30:57.056 --> 31:00.226
Well, I-I gave him
a piece of advice and...

31:00.326 --> 31:01.527
maybe I overstepped.

31:01.627 --> 31:06.132
I told him not
to follow in my footsteps.

31:06.232 --> 31:10.069
Where getting remarried
is concerned.

31:10.169 --> 31:12.804
That'd be <i>our</i> footsteps.

31:12.905 --> 31:14.606
Well, I think I said "our,"
but I...

31:14.706 --> 31:16.808
I-I wasn't trying
to speak for you.

31:16.909 --> 31:18.644
I would've said the same thing.

31:18.744 --> 31:21.047
Actually, I kind of
surprised myself.

31:21.147 --> 31:24.316
I thought I had all
that stuff, you know...

31:24.416 --> 31:27.886
locked deep
in the archives, but...

31:27.987 --> 31:29.956
In the "regret" section?

31:32.324 --> 31:34.360
No, not really.

31:36.028 --> 31:40.532
I just never met the one
I couldn't live without.

31:40.632 --> 31:41.667
Second time.

31:43.369 --> 31:45.237
What about you?

31:46.538 --> 31:50.509
Well, I was cursed
with the roaming eye.

31:50.609 --> 31:53.545
But Betty made all that go away.

31:53.645 --> 31:55.814
Because...

31:55.914 --> 31:57.549
she was one in a million.

31:58.917 --> 32:00.953
As for the rest of the million,
I knew that I'd just go back

32:01.053 --> 32:03.089
to being the way I was.

32:04.756 --> 32:06.125
As nature intended.

32:06.225 --> 32:09.528
Go ahead and laugh,
but I know me.

32:13.365 --> 32:15.267
Toward the end...

32:16.368 --> 32:20.372
Toward the end, Mary made me
promise I wouldn't be alone.

32:21.607 --> 32:23.509
Even served up a list
of candidates.

32:23.609 --> 32:25.911
Sounds just like her.

32:26.812 --> 32:28.247
Wait.

32:28.347 --> 32:30.616
That means you didn't keep
your promise.

32:30.716 --> 32:32.551
No, I did.

32:33.785 --> 32:36.888
Way my life is now...

32:36.989 --> 32:40.059
I'm hardly ever alone.

32:41.327 --> 32:44.663
You're still on the hook
for Danny, though.

32:44.763 --> 32:48.234
He wouldn't have gone to all
the trouble that he has

32:48.334 --> 32:51.337
unless this meant a hell
of a lot to him.

32:52.938 --> 32:55.341
So, what are you gonna be?

32:55.441 --> 32:57.009
His boss or his dad?

33:15.927 --> 33:17.229
Hey, Detective.

33:17.329 --> 33:18.630
What do we got?

33:18.730 --> 33:20.366
Suspect is armed,
holding multiple hostages.

33:20.466 --> 33:21.700
Has he made any demands?

33:21.800 --> 33:22.868
Just one.

33:22.968 --> 33:24.103
To talk to you.

33:25.671 --> 33:27.506
Okay, I'm...
I'm heading in.
Excuse me?

33:27.606 --> 33:28.507
I'm gonna enter
the building.

33:28.607 --> 33:29.508
Absolutely not.

33:29.608 --> 33:30.976
We got multiple hostages

33:31.077 --> 33:32.378
being held up by a guy

33:32.478 --> 33:33.812
who only wants
to talk to me.

33:33.912 --> 33:35.047
This is how I'm
gonna do it.

33:43.289 --> 33:44.556
Hey.

33:46.158 --> 33:47.493
Liam.

33:48.660 --> 33:49.961
Put the gun down.

33:53.632 --> 33:55.301
I messed up, man.

33:55.401 --> 33:56.668
Is anyone hurt?

33:57.903 --> 34:00.706
I just came in
to ask a question.

34:00.806 --> 34:01.940
And he-he was rude to me. Hey.

34:02.040 --> 34:02.841
Hey.

34:02.941 --> 34:03.975
And he wouldn't listen.

34:04.076 --> 34:05.377
Hey.

34:05.477 --> 34:06.845
And you were
wrong, all right?

34:06.945 --> 34:09.648
People do not do
simple favors out here.

34:09.748 --> 34:10.982
It's just like
it was inside.

34:11.083 --> 34:11.983
It's dog eat dog.

34:12.084 --> 34:13.385
Put the gun down, Liam.

34:14.653 --> 34:15.887
It's too late, man.

34:15.987 --> 34:17.523
It's not.

34:17.623 --> 34:18.990
We can work this out.

34:19.091 --> 34:20.126
I can't.

34:21.193 --> 34:23.028
I don't want to shoot you, Liam.

34:23.129 --> 34:24.563
But I will.

34:25.564 --> 34:26.632
You can have a whole new life.

34:26.732 --> 34:28.300
Think about what
you're about to give up.

34:28.400 --> 34:30.602
Give up?

34:30.702 --> 34:32.904
It's what I'm about to get back.

34:34.606 --> 34:37.109
Inside, I know what's what.

34:37.209 --> 34:39.044
Out here...?

34:39.145 --> 34:40.346
I'm lost.

34:40.446 --> 34:41.413
That's not true.

34:41.513 --> 34:43.115
Think about before.

34:43.215 --> 34:45.083
Look around.

34:46.552 --> 34:50.689
There's no "before"
for me anymore.

34:50.789 --> 34:52.958
Put the gun down, Liam.

34:54.092 --> 34:56.595
Okay, so, I held
the gun on the guy

34:56.695 --> 34:58.997
while I emptied the register,
I took the hostages,

34:59.097 --> 35:00.999
that's got to be worth, what,
like five to seven?

35:01.099 --> 35:02.401
I'm not a D.A.

35:02.501 --> 35:05.671
But enough to put me
back inside for a stretch.

35:07.739 --> 35:10.509
I would think so, yeah.

35:36.735 --> 35:38.537
I, uh, I spoke to Damien

35:38.637 --> 35:40.472
from the Ace Double Treys
this morning.

35:40.572 --> 35:42.474
I knew it.
I knew it was him.

35:42.574 --> 35:44.276
No, actually, it wasn't him.

35:44.376 --> 35:45.677
Whatever you
think about him,

35:45.777 --> 35:48.980
Damien really
respected your dad.

35:49.080 --> 35:50.716
In fact, he put his life
on the line

35:50.816 --> 35:53.319
to tell me who it was
that sold your dad fentanyl.

35:53.419 --> 35:55.321
Wait... fentanyl?

35:55.421 --> 35:57.356
Yeah. You should also know

35:57.456 --> 36:00.292
that before he passed, your dad
met with his lawyer again.

36:00.392 --> 36:02.261
To change his will.

36:02.361 --> 36:03.595
What are you saying?

36:05.063 --> 36:06.832
I'm saying...

36:06.932 --> 36:09.268
that your dad knew
he was gonna die.

36:09.368 --> 36:11.903
He intended to.

36:13.472 --> 36:16.141
He... killed himself?

36:16.242 --> 36:18.310
We're not certain.

36:18.410 --> 36:21.580
We're waiting for the
toxicology results to come back

36:21.680 --> 36:22.748
from the M.E.'s office,

36:22.848 --> 36:25.451
but that's the
way it looks.

36:25.551 --> 36:26.485
No.

36:26.585 --> 36:27.453
I'm sorry.

36:27.553 --> 36:29.455
He was alone.

36:29.555 --> 36:31.790
And his last remaining
family member

36:31.890 --> 36:33.659
wouldn't even talk to him?

36:35.661 --> 36:39.064
The guilt will crush you
if you let it.

36:39.164 --> 36:40.566
Trust me, I know.

36:40.666 --> 36:42.834
What am I supposed to do?

36:42.934 --> 36:46.238
Your father changed his will.

36:46.338 --> 36:48.307
To leave
everything to you.

36:48.407 --> 36:49.608
He loved you.

36:49.708 --> 36:51.943
And he didn't blame you
for any of this.

36:52.043 --> 36:53.078
He didn't.

36:53.178 --> 36:55.714
It's all here.

36:57.483 --> 36:59.685
You just got to read it.

37:00.719 --> 37:02.988
I can't.
You can.

37:03.088 --> 37:05.791
Eric, you should.

37:08.226 --> 37:10.061
It's okay.

37:26.412 --> 37:28.146
Based on the information
that Devon provided,

37:28.246 --> 37:31.350
my office is working on a deal
to have him transferred

37:31.450 --> 37:33.051
to a reentry program.

37:33.151 --> 37:33.852
So he's free?

37:33.952 --> 37:35.321
Not yet, but soon.

37:35.421 --> 37:37.756
Thank you so much.

37:39.391 --> 37:40.492
You've changed his life,

37:40.592 --> 37:41.593
my family's life,
for the better.

37:41.693 --> 37:43.362
I just did
what's right.

37:43.462 --> 37:46.231
And what you did is more
than earned my endorsement.

37:46.332 --> 37:47.899
Madam D.A.

37:47.999 --> 37:51.036
Actually, there's someone else
you should be thanking, too.

37:52.538 --> 37:53.472
Surprise.

37:53.572 --> 37:55.073
It's your lucky day.

37:55.173 --> 37:57.309
Two prosecutors
for the price of one.

37:58.444 --> 37:59.811
I don't know what to say.

37:59.911 --> 38:01.179
Well, you can start
with I'm sorry

38:01.279 --> 38:02.314
for using the both of you

38:02.414 --> 38:04.082
in my little game.

38:04.182 --> 38:05.751
It's not a game.

38:06.585 --> 38:08.654
It's politics.
And my endorsement

38:08.754 --> 38:09.655
is worth a lot.

38:09.755 --> 38:10.789
We're not interested.

38:10.889 --> 38:12.558
But we are interested

38:12.658 --> 38:14.125
in the fancy car out front.

38:14.225 --> 38:15.093
Excuse me?

38:15.193 --> 38:16.795
You know that sweet red Ferrari?

38:16.895 --> 38:18.229
That's yours, right?

38:18.330 --> 38:19.465
Yeah.

38:19.565 --> 38:20.899
It's an awfully nice car
for a preacher.

38:20.999 --> 38:22.167
I've been blessed.

38:22.267 --> 38:23.535
Yeah, so you claim.

38:23.635 --> 38:26.271
We've actually opened
a fraud investigation

38:26.372 --> 38:27.305
into your latest charity.

38:27.406 --> 38:29.274
Apparently,
there's been

38:29.375 --> 38:30.742
some evidence about

38:30.842 --> 38:32.043
misallocation of funds?

38:32.143 --> 38:33.345
I don't know what
you're talking about.

38:33.445 --> 38:34.913
Is that so?

38:35.013 --> 38:36.715
'Cause I caught wind
of it after talking

38:36.815 --> 38:38.517
to your congregation
while investigating

38:38.617 --> 38:40.185
your nephew's case.

38:40.285 --> 38:41.887
But we're sure that,
you know, the car and...

38:41.987 --> 38:43.455
And the jewelry you're wearing.

38:43.555 --> 38:45.457
We're sure it's all been
paid for out of pocket.

38:45.557 --> 38:46.958
But don't worry.

38:47.058 --> 38:49.928
We'll do whatever it takes
to uncover the truth.

38:50.028 --> 38:53.365
That's right.
Which you know now quite well.

38:55.734 --> 38:58.670
I'm sure we will be
seeing you around.

39:11.149 --> 39:12.050
Hey.

39:12.150 --> 39:13.619
Hey.

39:13.719 --> 39:15.153
Oof.

39:15.253 --> 39:17.456
Place is a little fancy
for you, isn't it?

39:17.556 --> 39:18.957
Yeah, it's homey.

39:19.057 --> 39:21.259
I almost got stuck
to the floor on the way in.

39:21.359 --> 39:22.961
Yeah, I kind of
dragged some lowlife

39:23.061 --> 39:24.996
out of here before
you walked in.
I bet.

39:25.096 --> 39:27.699
Um, is Manhattan
still your poison?

39:27.799 --> 39:29.234
Sure is.

39:29.334 --> 39:31.036
Steve, can I have
a Manhattan, please?
You got it.

39:31.136 --> 39:32.604
Thanks.

39:32.704 --> 39:34.473
Been a while since we did this.

39:34.573 --> 39:35.707
Yeah.

39:35.807 --> 39:37.275
It's nice to be seen
outside of work.

39:37.375 --> 39:40.812
I thought we should celebrate
your retirement and...

39:40.912 --> 39:42.814
also the fact that
you'll be granted

39:42.914 --> 39:44.750
your full disability pension.

39:44.850 --> 39:46.652
You're serious?

39:46.752 --> 39:48.053
Mm-hmm.

39:50.489 --> 39:52.524
Oh, my God.

39:52.624 --> 39:55.026
Danny, that's...

39:55.126 --> 39:58.229
That's amazing,
I-I don't know what to say.

39:59.097 --> 40:00.866
I can't thank you enough.

40:00.966 --> 40:01.933
You don't have to thank me.

40:02.033 --> 40:03.502
It's what you deserve.

40:04.770 --> 40:07.606
And hopefully it'll help you out
with whatever comes next.

40:07.706 --> 40:10.241
Thanks.
Thanks.

40:11.543 --> 40:12.911
It's going to be so weird
not coming in

40:13.011 --> 40:15.881
to the squad every day,

40:15.981 --> 40:18.016
seeing everyone...
Well, you'll still see us.

40:18.116 --> 40:19.685
This coming from the guy
always juggling

40:19.785 --> 40:20.886
a thousand cases?

40:20.986 --> 40:24.222
I know. Well, you'll see me.

40:24.322 --> 40:26.091
I hope so.

40:29.194 --> 40:31.930
The meatballs are
exceptional today.

40:32.030 --> 40:33.131
Thank you, Sean.

40:33.231 --> 40:34.299
Have mine.

40:35.433 --> 40:36.502
Well, I guess not
everyone agrees.

40:36.602 --> 40:37.869
No, just not hungry.

40:37.969 --> 40:39.771
Yeah, you haven't been
talking much either.

40:39.871 --> 40:41.239
Yeah, you feeling okay?

40:41.339 --> 40:42.841
Yep, fine.

40:42.941 --> 40:44.242
Well, sometimes when
people say they're fine,

40:44.342 --> 40:47.012
what they really mean
is the acronym FINE.

40:47.979 --> 40:49.047
What are you talking about?

40:49.147 --> 40:51.917
F-I-N-E:
freaked out, insecure, neurotic,

40:52.017 --> 40:53.351
and emotional.

40:54.553 --> 40:56.054
Maybe we ought to
leave this alone.

40:56.154 --> 40:57.122
Thanks.

40:57.222 --> 40:58.724
Well, I would say
your Sunday best

40:58.824 --> 41:00.458
looks better than usual.

41:00.559 --> 41:01.527
Erin.

41:01.627 --> 41:02.828
What? I'm just saying that...

41:02.928 --> 41:05.130
Uh...
I...

41:05.230 --> 41:06.865
Yeah, you got a hot date
or something?

41:06.965 --> 41:08.767
Actually...

41:08.867 --> 41:09.768
Oh, my God, he does.

41:09.868 --> 41:11.002
Whoa.

41:11.102 --> 41:12.037
Ooh.

41:12.137 --> 41:13.572
No-- well, I was wondering

41:13.672 --> 41:14.973
why you were glowing.

41:15.073 --> 41:17.408
I'm not glowing, okay?

41:17.509 --> 41:19.077
It's not a big deal,
it's just dinner.

41:19.177 --> 41:20.979
That's why I'm
not eating.

41:21.079 --> 41:22.280
That's great, Dad.

41:22.380 --> 41:23.782
Thank you.

41:24.516 --> 41:25.784
Well, what's her name?
I want to know everything.

41:25.884 --> 41:27.118
20 bucks
she's in law enforcement.

41:27.218 --> 41:28.153
I'll take that action.

41:28.253 --> 41:29.621
I'm going with medical examiner.

41:29.721 --> 41:30.756
Ooh, macabre.

41:30.856 --> 41:31.757
Ooh.

41:32.891 --> 41:34.893
And maybe it's nobody's business

41:34.993 --> 41:36.762
around this table.

41:36.862 --> 41:38.463
Maybe Danny needs
a little privacy.

41:38.564 --> 41:40.732
It's okay, Dad. It's okay.

41:40.832 --> 41:43.602
Her name is Laura Acosta.

41:45.637 --> 41:47.573
Detective Laura Acosta.

41:47.673 --> 41:49.107
20 bucks, please.

41:49.207 --> 41:50.308
Yeah, yeah.

41:50.408 --> 41:51.677
Pay up, buddy.
Yeah, yeah.

41:51.777 --> 41:52.744
Where you taking her?

41:52.844 --> 41:54.012
Manducatis.

41:54.112 --> 41:55.146
Ooh, fancy.

41:55.246 --> 41:57.182
You said it wasn't a big deal.

41:57.282 --> 41:58.049
It's not!

41:58.149 --> 41:59.084
That's a big deal.

41:59.184 --> 42:00.686
Maybe a little.

42:00.786 --> 42:01.820
Want my advice?

42:01.920 --> 42:03.655
No, not particularly.

42:04.289 --> 42:06.457
Strong eye contact.
That's the key.

42:06.558 --> 42:07.693
That's weird.

42:08.560 --> 42:10.095
You have to listen.
I mean, really listen.

42:10.195 --> 42:11.296
And don't drink too much.

42:11.396 --> 42:12.130
Or eat too much.

42:12.230 --> 42:13.364
And stay off your phone.

42:13.464 --> 42:15.033
But mostly just don't think
about it.

42:15.133 --> 42:16.234
Yeah, simple.

42:16.334 --> 42:17.803
Got it.

42:17.903 --> 42:19.605
Any advice from you?

42:19.705 --> 42:21.773
Take your time and be yourself.

42:21.873 --> 42:23.074
And whatever you do,

42:23.174 --> 42:25.777
lie about how crazy
your family is.

42:27.512 --> 42:30.081
Best advice I've gotten
all night. Yeah.
