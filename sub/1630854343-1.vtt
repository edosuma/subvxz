00:38.455 --> 00:42.334
Before Rome, before Babylon,

00:42.417 --> 00:45.170
before the pyramids,
there was kahndaq.

00:52.594 --> 00:54.805
The first self-governing people
on earth,

00:54.888 --> 00:57.766
kahndaq was a center of power
and enlightenment.

00:57.849 --> 00:59.518
For centuries, they thrived.

01:05.440 --> 01:07.776
But then...

01:11.363 --> 01:12.447
Came king ahk-ton.

01:14.241 --> 01:17.953
Using the army to seize power,
ahk-ton became a tyrant.

01:18.036 --> 01:19.621
But he had
even darker ambitions.

01:28.130 --> 01:29.881
Obsessed with dark magic,

01:29.965 --> 01:33.218
ahk-ton's real goal was
to forge the crown of sabbac.

01:38.015 --> 01:39.933
If infused with the powers
of the six demons

01:40.017 --> 01:42.227
of the ancient world...

01:42.311 --> 01:45.188
It would make ahk-ton
invincible.

01:45.272 --> 01:47.190
To make the crown,
he needed eternium.

01:47.274 --> 01:48.942
A rare mineral
of magic properties,

01:49.026 --> 01:51.403
found only in kahndaq.

01:51.486 --> 01:53.071
So he enslaved his own people

01:55.032 --> 01:56.783
and forced them to dig.

02:09.713 --> 02:11.173
Eternium.

02:14.926 --> 02:18.347
Eternium.

02:27.898 --> 02:29.649
Kahndaq was teetering
on the brink.

02:31.318 --> 02:32.944
What they needed...

02:33.028 --> 02:34.946
Get off him! Get off him!

02:35.030 --> 02:37.199
Get off him! Get off him!

02:38.867 --> 02:40.243
Was a hero.

02:40.327 --> 02:43.288
Why are we fighting each other?

02:43.372 --> 02:46.416
Remember who our real enemy is!
Come with me.

02:48.668 --> 02:50.170
Look! Eternium.

02:52.130 --> 02:53.130
Let me see that.

02:58.303 --> 03:01.181
The king thanks you.

03:01.264 --> 03:02.384
He's supposed to reward him.

03:02.432 --> 03:04.142
Is that right?

03:04.226 --> 03:05.477
I want what I'm owed.

03:06.395 --> 03:07.562
Hmm.

03:11.024 --> 03:12.567
You want a reward?

03:16.196 --> 03:17.823
The king thanks you
for your service.

03:26.498 --> 03:28.458
You want the king's reward, too?

03:30.168 --> 03:33.046
No, but my son accepts
the king's mercy.

03:39.136 --> 03:42.389
I won't always be here
to protect you.

03:42.472 --> 03:45.183
I don't need protection.
I want to be free.

03:45.267 --> 03:48.103
If we fight together,
we could overthrow the king.

03:48.186 --> 03:49.563
Let someone else be the hero...

03:49.646 --> 03:51.815
The graveyards are full of them.

03:51.898 --> 03:54.526
Stop dreaming
and go back to work.

03:59.614 --> 04:01.741
Someone to hold
the hopes of the people.

04:04.619 --> 04:06.955
Even when all hope seems lost.

04:08.290 --> 04:11.376
If we had more heroes...

04:11.460 --> 04:14.129
Then maybe our freedom
wouldn't be a dream!

04:17.424 --> 04:19.259
Freedom!

04:41.948 --> 04:43.700
King ahk-ton knew
that this spark

04:43.783 --> 04:45.410
could quickly ignite a fire.

04:45.494 --> 04:48.121
And so, he ordered
that it be snuffed out.

04:52.000 --> 04:53.960
They thought they were
getting a martyr.

04:55.795 --> 04:57.297
Instead...

04:57.380 --> 04:59.180
They got a miracle.

05:09.184 --> 05:10.602
The council of wizards,

05:10.685 --> 05:12.395
the magical guardians
of the earth...

05:12.479 --> 05:14.648
You have been chosen.

05:14.731 --> 05:16.011
Sought to restore the balance.

05:16.066 --> 05:17.651
The stamina of shu!

05:17.734 --> 05:19.712
They empowered him with
the gifts of the ancient gods.

05:19.736 --> 05:20.612
- The swiftness of heru!
- The strength of amon!

05:20.695 --> 05:21.988
And turned a boy...

05:22.072 --> 05:23.490
The wisdom of zehuti!

05:23.573 --> 05:24.449
- The power of aten!
- The courage of mehen!

05:24.533 --> 05:25.200
Into a champion.

05:25.283 --> 05:26.283
Shazam!

05:28.411 --> 05:30.205
Hurry.
Give it to me!

05:30.288 --> 05:31.933
But the crown had
already been completed.

05:31.957 --> 05:33.077
Give it to me!

05:35.752 --> 05:37.104
And when the champion
arrived at the palace

05:37.128 --> 05:39.130
to challenge him...

05:39.214 --> 05:41.341
King ahk-ton summoned
its demonic power.

05:46.137 --> 05:49.766
In the ensuing battle,
the palace was destroyed,

05:49.849 --> 05:52.602
but the champion was victorious.

05:52.686 --> 05:54.563
The wizards hid
the crown of sabbac

05:54.646 --> 05:57.566
so that it would never again
fall into the hands of man.

05:57.649 --> 06:00.527
And the champion
was never heard from again.

06:05.448 --> 06:08.785
Today, kahndaq is occupied
by international mercenaries,

06:08.868 --> 06:11.997
the intergang, the latest
in a series of
foreign invaders.

06:14.583 --> 06:17.586
But legend says,
whenever kahndaq
needs him most,

06:17.669 --> 06:21.590
the champion will return
to restore freedom
to the people.

06:21.673 --> 06:23.925
It has been a long, long wait.

06:37.731 --> 06:38.773
Show me your papers.

06:43.194 --> 06:44.779
Move it along!

06:44.863 --> 06:46.340
Have your documentation ready.

06:48.908 --> 06:50.744
It's all our
three documents, yeah?

06:50.827 --> 06:52.078
Don't judge the picture,

06:52.162 --> 06:53.802
it's after my girlfriend
broke up with me.

06:58.668 --> 07:02.130
Open the back.
Need a look inside.

07:05.133 --> 07:06.551
Yeah, it's unlocked, man.

07:08.428 --> 07:11.222
It's just a bunch of old tvs.
I'm an electrician.

07:18.146 --> 07:20.398
Hey!

07:20.482 --> 07:21.733
Watch where you're going.

07:21.816 --> 07:23.526
You know the drill,
back of the line.

07:23.610 --> 07:25.403
Come on, man,
you see me every day.

07:25.487 --> 07:27.131
And every day I tell ya,

07:27.155 --> 07:28.948
if it's got wheels,
it's a vehicle.

07:29.032 --> 07:30.450
Back of the line, mate.

07:30.533 --> 07:31.618
You're not my mate.

07:32.994 --> 07:35.747
I'm heartbroken.
Now, go on, piss off.

07:35.830 --> 07:39.250
No, what you are
is a Neo-imperialist enforcer,

07:39.334 --> 07:41.127
from halfway around the world,

07:41.211 --> 07:43.672
sent here to steal
my country's natural resources,

07:43.755 --> 07:46.174
strip-mine our sacred lands,
pollute our water,

07:46.257 --> 07:47.592
oppress our heritage,

07:47.676 --> 07:49.302
and make us wait in lines
all day.

07:51.763 --> 07:55.016
Hey, boss man. Can I go?

07:55.809 --> 07:56.809
Hey!

08:01.439 --> 08:02.565
Go on, get out of here.

08:02.649 --> 08:04.109
Yeah, yeah.

08:13.076 --> 08:14.494
Adrianna, we're clear.

08:22.043 --> 08:24.379
Kahndaq isn't safe
for us anymore.

08:24.462 --> 08:25.690
Let's just move the crown first,

08:25.714 --> 08:26.994
and then we can
worry about safe.

08:27.048 --> 08:28.758
I got intergang
watching my house.

08:28.842 --> 08:31.636
I gave up my job
at the university
and moved four times.

08:31.720 --> 08:33.513
It doesn't mean I'm gonna
abandon my country.

08:33.596 --> 08:36.266
I'm just saying, no one stays
a step ahead of them forever.

08:36.349 --> 08:38.435
We can't wait for things
to cool down this time.

08:38.518 --> 08:41.521
If I'm right,
they're days away
from finding it.

08:46.443 --> 08:48.737
- What are you doing?
- I want to come with you.

08:48.820 --> 08:50.155
You know it's too dangerous.

08:50.238 --> 08:51.781
You shouldn't have
gotten involved.

08:51.865 --> 08:54.451
Come on, I want to help you
beat those bastards.

08:54.534 --> 08:56.369
Adrianna,
keep your head down, please.

08:56.453 --> 08:58.288
- You want to be a hero, huh?
- I do, yeah.

08:58.371 --> 09:00.248
Go home, do your homework.

09:00.331 --> 09:04.377
Your time will come one day,
but not today, son.

09:04.461 --> 09:05.462
Go!

09:05.545 --> 09:07.338
Go, little man. You did good.

09:37.660 --> 09:39.829
That would get you a fortune
on the black market.

09:40.914 --> 09:42.457
Is that real eternium?

09:44.042 --> 09:45.460
Show us a little magic.

09:45.543 --> 09:47.670
It doesn't work like that,
it's unrefined.

09:47.754 --> 09:49.255
You guys should get some rest.

09:49.339 --> 09:51.424
I thought intergang
seized all the old relics.

09:51.508 --> 09:52.634
Hey, come on. Stop it.

09:52.717 --> 09:53.986
I'm just curious how she got it.

09:54.010 --> 09:55.804
My grandmother gave it to me.

09:55.887 --> 09:59.390
- How did she get it?
- It's not a museum piece.

09:59.474 --> 10:01.392
It's a family heirloom,
going all the way back

10:01.476 --> 10:03.269
to the days
when kahndaq was free.

10:04.270 --> 10:05.772
You happy now?

10:05.855 --> 10:07.023
Cool story.

10:11.027 --> 10:12.862
And all I inherited
was a sweater.

10:12.946 --> 10:15.573
That's not true. Baba left you
his Van and his bald spot.

10:15.657 --> 10:17.367
You know, some women
like a bald spot.

10:17.450 --> 10:19.911
Curly on the outside,
smooth on the inside. You know?

10:45.019 --> 10:46.604
Are you sure about this?

10:46.688 --> 10:48.528
The inscriptions
we found are clear.

10:48.606 --> 10:51.317
And I'm positive
about that translation.

10:51.401 --> 10:53.319
There is something
inside that mountain.

10:56.406 --> 10:59.284
What if it really
is the crown? Then what?

10:59.367 --> 11:01.327
It's a source of great power.
Who gets to keep it?

11:01.411 --> 11:04.330
No one. We hide it again
someplace else.

11:04.414 --> 11:06.291
Get it out of the country
if we have to.

11:06.374 --> 11:08.710
It is too dangerous
for anyone to have.

11:10.211 --> 11:11.211
This is it?

11:12.088 --> 11:13.088
Not yet.

11:15.592 --> 11:18.386
- Are you coming?
- Eh, bad knee. I'll keep watch.

11:37.280 --> 11:40.241
This way.
Almost there.

11:47.123 --> 11:49.667
"Men were given
the gift of magic,

11:49.751 --> 11:52.629
but their hearts
were too easily corrupted."

11:57.467 --> 11:59.052
Keep reading.

11:59.135 --> 12:01.512
"The ultimate power
was banished from the earth

12:01.596 --> 12:03.765
and hidden... here."

12:05.391 --> 12:07.352
Until now.

12:07.435 --> 12:10.313
This mountain has kept
the crown of sabbac safe
for 5,000 years.

12:10.396 --> 12:13.900
We're 100%, totally,
like, no take-backs

12:13.983 --> 12:16.152
certain that we want to move it?

12:16.235 --> 12:17.235
We don't have a choice.

12:18.821 --> 12:20.490
What happened to ishmael?

12:22.241 --> 12:24.953
Great.
Don't worry, I'll find him.

12:30.083 --> 12:31.417
♪ Baby, come back ♪

12:32.752 --> 12:36.089
♪ oh, baby... on me ♪

12:36.172 --> 12:37.840
♪ I was wrong ♪

12:37.924 --> 12:41.052
♪ and I just can't live
without you ♪

12:41.135 --> 12:44.013
♪ baby, come back... ♪

12:45.765 --> 12:47.141
Samir?

12:51.896 --> 12:53.398
Samir, what happened?

12:53.481 --> 12:55.400
What?

12:55.483 --> 12:57.819
I can't hear you.
What are you saying?

13:00.321 --> 13:02.699
Don't move! Unless you want
to join your mate.

13:02.782 --> 13:05.576
Stay where you are!

13:05.660 --> 13:08.121
Oh, hey. Oh, hey. Hey...

13:12.542 --> 13:13.862
"Turn back."

13:16.087 --> 13:18.131
That's what it says, no?

13:18.214 --> 13:19.716
Yes.

13:19.799 --> 13:20.883
Where is Samir?

13:22.218 --> 13:25.722
Claustrophobic.
Needed some air.

13:25.805 --> 13:27.724
- Is this the way to the crown?
- I think so.

13:42.238 --> 13:43.489
It's a tomb.

13:49.495 --> 13:51.622
"Speak not his power,

13:51.706 --> 13:54.208
so he may suffer
a dreamless sleep

13:54.292 --> 13:56.252
for all eternity." Teth Adam.

13:56.335 --> 13:59.172
The slave who became champion
and defeated the king.

13:59.255 --> 14:00.590
The legend was true.

14:00.673 --> 14:04.844
Kahndaq...
Really did have a hero once.

14:04.927 --> 14:07.638
If he was such a hero,
why'd they Bury him down here?

14:32.497 --> 14:33.873
The crown.

15:18.209 --> 15:19.669
It's over.

15:19.752 --> 15:22.255
Now, give me the crown.

15:22.338 --> 15:23.714
Run, addy! Run!

15:27.093 --> 15:28.779
Hold fire!

15:28.803 --> 15:31.264
Don't hit the crown! Get her!

15:33.766 --> 15:35.828
- Go! Move.
- Circle around!

15:35.852 --> 15:37.562
Get down!

15:42.900 --> 15:45.987
Say goodbye to your brother.

15:46.070 --> 15:48.072
In five...

15:48.156 --> 15:49.782
Four...

15:49.866 --> 15:50.866
Three...

15:51.284 --> 15:52.284
Two...

15:53.244 --> 15:54.287
One...

15:54.370 --> 15:56.581
I'm over here.

15:56.664 --> 15:59.375
One? You let them get to one?

16:16.267 --> 16:17.852
Any last words?

16:20.563 --> 16:22.023
Please tell my son...

16:26.319 --> 16:27.820
"Mightiest of mortals,

16:28.988 --> 16:30.489
god of gods,

16:30.573 --> 16:33.409
- six immortal elders
by name..."
- What?

16:33.492 --> 16:35.745
"Shazam!"

16:46.672 --> 16:48.633
Who the hell is that?

16:48.716 --> 16:51.052
You wouldn't believe me
if I told you.

17:08.819 --> 17:10.238
Check him out.

17:10.321 --> 17:11.739
Boss say you go.

17:11.822 --> 17:13.115
Chief say your turn.

17:26.045 --> 17:28.256
Hey, amigo.
Let me see your hands.

17:53.531 --> 17:54.657
Open fire!

18:00.037 --> 18:01.539
Your magic is weak.

18:08.713 --> 18:10.423
Go.

18:37.575 --> 18:39.869
We need immediate backup!
Send everything you've got!

18:52.298 --> 18:53.298
Ishmael!

19:02.933 --> 19:03.933
Ishmael!

19:30.086 --> 19:31.379
Let's go!

19:31.462 --> 19:32.880
This is as fast as I can go.

20:01.826 --> 20:04.036
Samir! What happened?

20:04.120 --> 20:06.163
What didn't happen!

20:06.247 --> 20:07.873
Samir fell off of a cliff.

20:07.957 --> 20:10.835
I had a gun to my head.

20:10.918 --> 20:12.711
Ishmael is buried
under a mountain.

20:14.213 --> 20:16.048
And you summoned
some flying magic man.

20:16.132 --> 20:18.134
All for what? Nothing!

20:20.010 --> 20:21.053
- Oh.
- Not for nothing.

20:39.405 --> 20:40.405
Light him up.

20:53.210 --> 20:55.671
Shit! Where the hell
did he come from?

20:55.754 --> 20:56.755
Rotor out! Go! Go!

20:58.716 --> 21:00.444
I can't maintain altitude!

21:26.452 --> 21:32.333
♪ I see a red door
and I want it painted black ♪

21:32.416 --> 21:37.087
♪ no colors anymore
I want them to turn black ♪

21:49.225 --> 21:52.728
♪ I wanna see your face
painted black ♪

21:52.811 --> 21:56.190

22:27.763 --> 22:28.764
♪ Yeah ♪

22:28.847 --> 22:29.847
Oh, shit.

22:36.522 --> 22:37.722
Stop! Stop the Van!

23:14.560 --> 23:16.103
Behind you!

23:19.189 --> 23:20.482
Did he just catch a rocket?

23:56.477 --> 23:58.103
God willing,
we won't see him again.

24:11.158 --> 24:13.952
Wait. Hey! Hey!
What are you doing?

24:14.036 --> 24:15.596
Don't touch him,
he's made of lightning.

24:16.747 --> 24:18.040
Good point.

24:18.123 --> 24:19.523
You get him,
you're the electrician.

24:27.466 --> 24:28.926
Raptor team, come in.

24:29.009 --> 24:30.009
What's your status?

24:33.472 --> 24:35.307
Help me.

24:35.391 --> 24:38.977
I told you
to make it look real,
not punch me in the face.

24:41.939 --> 24:43.458
Raptor team, come in.

24:43.482 --> 24:44.692
What's your status?

24:44.775 --> 24:46.860
Status is that everyone is dead.

24:46.944 --> 24:49.488
Ishmael, is that you?
What happened?

24:49.571 --> 24:53.534
The crown wasn't the only thing
waiting for us down here.

24:53.617 --> 24:55.786
- Do you have it?
- No.

24:55.869 --> 24:57.162
But I know who does.

24:57.246 --> 24:59.248
Copy that. We're en route
to your location.

25:01.375 --> 25:03.019
We need immediate backup.

25:03.043 --> 25:04.545
Send everything you've got!

25:04.628 --> 25:05.647
This rare, magical mineral

25:05.671 --> 25:07.381
has been mined for centuries...

25:07.464 --> 25:08.817
Reports
of an eternium blast.

25:08.841 --> 25:10.551
It is unknown who or why...

25:10.634 --> 25:12.153
Decimated
a number of troops.

25:12.177 --> 25:13.887
An unidentified male.

25:13.971 --> 25:15.806
This being is
somehow able to harness...

25:15.889 --> 25:17.391
What do you think?

25:17.474 --> 25:19.935
I think this loose Cannon
needs to be locked down

25:20.018 --> 25:22.020
before innocent people
start getting hurt.

25:22.104 --> 25:23.939
Oh, and good morning
to you, too.

25:24.022 --> 25:25.733
Shove it up your ass, Carter.

25:25.816 --> 25:28.444
He's been asleep
for 5,000 years.

25:28.527 --> 25:31.822
He'll be disoriented at first.
The longer he has to adapt,

25:31.905 --> 25:34.074
the harder it will be
to take him down.

25:35.367 --> 25:36.702
Wheels up in 30.

25:36.785 --> 25:38.537
Who's on the team?

25:47.963 --> 25:49.673
Welcome.

25:49.757 --> 25:51.508
Please state your name
for identification.

25:51.592 --> 25:55.095
Uh, hi. I'm Maxine hunkel.
I'm here to see Mr. Hall.

25:55.179 --> 25:56.805
Confirmed. Welcome, Maxine.

25:56.889 --> 25:58.307
Thanks!

25:58.390 --> 26:00.434
Maxine hunkel, aka cyclone.

26:00.517 --> 26:04.354
Wind manipulation powers,
computer skills, smart as hell.

26:04.438 --> 26:08.150
Basically a tornado
with a 167 IQ.

26:08.233 --> 26:09.693
Sounds delightful.

26:09.777 --> 26:12.070
But please tell me
you found someone

26:12.154 --> 26:13.489
who can pack a punch.

26:13.572 --> 26:15.991
That's where atom smasher
comes in.

26:16.074 --> 26:18.911
Al rothstein, nephew
to the original atom smasher.

26:18.994 --> 26:20.994
Inherited his uncle's powers.

26:22.289 --> 26:24.541
- How's my suit? Does it fit?
- No, yeah. It's perfect.

26:24.625 --> 26:26.251
Thank you again
for letting me borrow it.

26:26.335 --> 26:28.354
You know, I used to watch you
all the time as a kid?

26:28.378 --> 26:31.048
This is literally
the only thing that
I'd ever wanted in my...

26:31.131 --> 26:33.026
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Don't let
anything happen to it.

26:33.050 --> 26:34.510
It's vintage.

26:34.593 --> 26:36.321
And don't let anything
happen to you, either.

26:36.345 --> 26:37.822
Don't do anything crazy.
You listen to Carter.

26:37.846 --> 26:40.307
I'm gonna make you proud,
uncle al. I promise.

26:42.559 --> 26:43.811
They seem green.

26:43.894 --> 26:45.479
That's why I called in Kent.

26:47.815 --> 26:49.983
Kent's been
out of action
for a little while,

26:50.067 --> 26:52.069
but I can't do this without him.

26:52.152 --> 26:53.862
Takes magic to fight magic,

26:53.946 --> 26:56.198
and the man's got
nearly god-level powers.

27:01.578 --> 27:04.164
It might take
a lot more than that.

27:04.248 --> 27:06.124
Are you sure they can take him?

27:06.208 --> 27:09.336
Waller, you find us a cell
that can hold him,

27:09.419 --> 27:11.129
we'll take care of the rest.

27:11.213 --> 27:12.213
Good luck.

27:17.886 --> 27:19.263
This is gonna be fun.

27:35.779 --> 27:38.782
- We're here, sir.
- Hmm? Oh, right.

27:43.120 --> 27:44.621
Was I staring again?

27:44.705 --> 27:46.039
Only half an hour or so, sir.

27:47.541 --> 27:49.001
Maybe next time, honk the horn?

27:49.084 --> 27:50.127
Of course, sir.

28:06.018 --> 28:07.811
So what's the op?

28:07.895 --> 28:09.539
We're headed to
kahndaq to apprehend
and contain

28:09.563 --> 28:11.231
a class-a rogue metahuman.

28:11.315 --> 28:12.816
I didn't bring a passport.

28:12.900 --> 28:16.820
We don't need passports.
We're the justice society.

28:24.286 --> 28:26.914
Is this entirely
made out of nth metal?

28:26.997 --> 28:29.333
Everything down to the screws.

28:29.416 --> 28:31.835
Completely indestructible.

28:31.919 --> 28:33.545
I'll be in the cockpit
if you need me.

28:36.089 --> 28:37.716
It's pretty cool.
You got any snacks?

28:40.552 --> 28:42.471
It takes a lot of energy
to smash atoms.

28:55.984 --> 28:56.985
Here.

28:58.111 --> 28:59.237
Oh! Thanks.

29:01.073 --> 29:02.866
I'm al, by the way.

29:02.950 --> 29:03.951
Maxine.

29:10.040 --> 29:11.040
What do you do?

29:11.083 --> 29:12.960
Wind. You?

29:13.043 --> 29:14.043
I grow.

29:14.962 --> 29:15.962
Cool.

29:44.282 --> 29:45.659
Whoa!

30:01.049 --> 30:02.849
Don't worry about that.
I can get another one.

30:06.722 --> 30:08.265
Uh, my mom's
not much of a doctor,

30:08.348 --> 30:09.975
but you should probably
leave the...

30:12.019 --> 30:13.562
Or do that.

30:17.566 --> 30:19.234
I know you have a lot
to catch up on.

30:19.317 --> 30:21.278
But I was thinking
we could help each other.

30:21.361 --> 30:23.530
- Move.
- I'm amon, by the way.

30:23.613 --> 30:25.198
I didn't ask for your name.

30:25.282 --> 30:26.575
You're teth Adam, right?

30:26.658 --> 30:28.201
Everyone in kahndaq
knows your story.

30:28.285 --> 30:29.995
- I said move.
- My mom said you took out

30:30.078 --> 30:31.830
a bunch of intergang soldiers
in the desert.

30:31.913 --> 30:33.433
Because they wouldn't move
out of my way.

30:33.457 --> 30:35.083
So you can really fly
and stop bullets,

30:35.167 --> 30:36.960
'cause that's really crucial
to my plan.

30:37.044 --> 30:38.521
And is it really you stopping
the bullets or is it the suit?

30:38.545 --> 30:40.172
Wait, what's your top speed?

30:40.255 --> 30:42.295
I'm sure you're fast,
but how fast? Like flash fast?

30:48.847 --> 30:50.807
Wait, did you really
not have mirrors back then?

30:52.684 --> 30:54.811
Wow, I guess a lot does change
in 5,000 years.

30:57.689 --> 30:59.274
Five thousand years?

30:59.357 --> 31:00.793
Yeah, that's how long
you were in the tomb.

31:00.817 --> 31:02.694
Until my mom woke you up.

31:02.778 --> 31:05.322
So you've got stopping bullets,
check, flying, check

31:05.405 --> 31:07.074
and lightning thing,
that's a big check.

31:12.954 --> 31:14.372
I don't know this place.

31:14.456 --> 31:16.041
This is your home.

31:19.795 --> 31:20.921
Then my home is gone.

31:37.187 --> 31:38.313
What happened to the crown?

31:39.356 --> 31:40.982
Too much?

31:44.820 --> 31:46.863
You know it's cursed
with demons, right?

31:56.957 --> 32:01.086
"Life is the...
Only path to death."

32:02.671 --> 32:03.964
No shit.

32:07.551 --> 32:10.929
"Teth Adam was a bronze age
kahndaqi Demi-god.

32:11.012 --> 32:15.058
He defeated king ahk-ton
in approximately 2,600 bc."

32:15.142 --> 32:16.726
There. That's you. See?

32:16.810 --> 32:18.079
That's the statue
they built of you.

32:18.103 --> 32:19.813
And now you're back.

32:19.896 --> 32:21.332
Our country's been oppressed
by one invader after another

32:21.356 --> 32:23.567
ever since you left.

32:23.650 --> 32:26.319
My point is,
kahndaq still isn't free.

32:26.403 --> 32:28.822
We could really use a superhero
right about now.

32:29.614 --> 32:31.449
I'm no hero.

32:31.533 --> 32:33.827
What?
Superman, Batman, aquaman...

32:33.910 --> 32:35.829
You're way more stacked
than any of them.

32:35.912 --> 32:38.206
And they're not coming
to kahndaq to save us.

32:38.290 --> 32:40.500
But you could stop intergang
all by yourself,

32:40.584 --> 32:41.824
just like you did king ahk-ton.

32:41.877 --> 32:43.253
You're our only hope.

33:07.944 --> 33:09.988
Wizards.

33:10.071 --> 33:11.448
I can fix it. Don't worry.

33:13.742 --> 33:15.577
I'm not a wizard.

33:17.078 --> 33:20.040
Hey, mom.
He's awake.

33:20.123 --> 33:21.499
I told you
not to go in your room.

33:22.751 --> 33:23.877
It was you who spoke.

33:26.296 --> 33:28.173
You woke me.

33:28.256 --> 33:30.425
I didn't have a choice.
I'd be dead
if it hadn't worked.

33:30.508 --> 33:32.260
The men in my tomb,
they were your enemies?

33:32.344 --> 33:34.596
- Yes.
- Then your enemies
are vanquished,

33:34.679 --> 33:36.598
condemned to the eternal sleep
of the damned.

33:36.681 --> 33:39.121
Actually, we still have
a lot of enemies
that need vanquishing.

33:39.184 --> 33:40.936
Then destroy them.

33:41.019 --> 33:43.146
Intergang have
guns and flybikes
and eternium rockets.

33:43.230 --> 33:44.230
We have my mom.

33:45.899 --> 33:47.317
Prove your strength.

33:47.400 --> 33:49.040
Destroy your enemy
and all he cares about.

33:49.069 --> 33:50.362
Make him beg for mercy,

33:50.445 --> 33:52.364
but deny it
until his final breath.

33:52.447 --> 33:54.199
Interesting, okay?

33:54.282 --> 33:55.867
I appreciate
what you did for me,

33:55.951 --> 33:59.120
but I do not want you
teaching my son violence.

34:00.413 --> 34:02.123
I understand.

34:02.207 --> 34:04.227
You want his father
to teach him violence.

34:04.251 --> 34:06.091
- Gross, that's my brother.
- That's my sister.

34:06.169 --> 34:08.255
- His father's dead.
- I'm sorry.

34:09.839 --> 34:11.442
Who do you want
to teach him violence then?

34:11.466 --> 34:14.094
Yeah, mom. Who do you want
to teach me violence?

34:14.177 --> 34:15.762
No one.

34:15.845 --> 34:19.724
I want a champion to help
free kahndaq from intergang.

34:20.934 --> 34:22.602
Please, help us.

34:40.912 --> 34:41.913
Wait! Wait.

34:43.540 --> 34:46.376
- Where are you going?
- I shouldn't be here.

34:46.459 --> 34:48.628
You don't feel any loyalty
to us at all?

34:48.712 --> 34:50.130
Not really, no.

34:50.213 --> 34:51.732
You're not seeing
the full possibilities here.

34:51.756 --> 34:53.675
I don't know what it was like
in ancient times,

34:53.758 --> 34:55.820
but having superpowers
is kind of a big deal
in our world.

34:55.844 --> 34:57.404
Maybe clean up your outfit
a little bit,

34:57.429 --> 34:58.638
get a cape, change your name.

34:58.722 --> 35:00.515
Teth Adam is a very strong name.

35:00.598 --> 35:01.933
It's a little outdated.

35:02.017 --> 35:03.411
And you definitely need
a catchphrase.

35:03.435 --> 35:04.978
Something blackout bad-ass
to say

35:05.061 --> 35:07.230
right before you absolutely
cook some dude.

35:07.314 --> 35:08.773
I don't waste words on the dead.

35:08.857 --> 35:10.543
Well, yeah, kind of like that,
but more catchy.

35:10.567 --> 35:12.152
I was thinking, like,

35:12.235 --> 35:14.155
"tell them the man in black
sent you."

35:14.237 --> 35:15.739
- Them?
- You know, gods, demons...

35:15.822 --> 35:17.866
Whoever's waiting for us
in the afterlife.

35:17.949 --> 35:19.802
And you wear a lot of black,
so we should really
lean into that.

35:19.826 --> 35:22.370
My point is,
you could be famous.

35:22.454 --> 35:24.497
Magazines, lunch boxes,
video games.

35:24.581 --> 35:27.500
And the superhero
industrial complex
is worth a lot of money.

35:27.584 --> 35:29.294
I don't need a box for my lunch.

35:29.377 --> 35:31.296
Anyone you've ever known
is dead.

35:34.507 --> 35:36.092
What else are you gonna do?

35:40.722 --> 35:42.557
Wait! Where are you going?

35:58.365 --> 36:01.076
Waller's file needs a bit
to be desired.

36:01.159 --> 36:02.827
Most of this was
considered a myth

36:02.911 --> 36:04.704
until yesterday afternoon.

36:04.788 --> 36:07.582
He's a bad man, Kent.
What else do you need to know?

36:07.665 --> 36:10.210
When you've seen as many
different futures as I have,

36:10.293 --> 36:12.170
you cease to believe
in absolutes.

36:14.422 --> 36:16.299
What are you laughing at?

36:16.383 --> 36:18.760
I'm not laughing.
That was a smirk.

36:18.843 --> 36:21.471
I know. That's how you laugh.

36:21.554 --> 36:22.806
I've missed having you around

36:22.889 --> 36:25.850
to spout old cryptic shit
like that.

36:25.934 --> 36:27.977
Almost as much as I've missed
having you around

36:28.061 --> 36:30.563
to ignore all my advice.
Carter...

36:32.107 --> 36:33.858
This is not a very good plan.

36:37.904 --> 36:39.906
Yeah, well...

36:39.989 --> 36:42.158
A bad plan is better
than no plan at all.

36:44.369 --> 36:45.995
If only there were
a third option.

36:49.874 --> 36:51.594
I wouldn't touch that
if I was you.

36:52.669 --> 36:54.087
Why not?

36:54.170 --> 36:55.689
'Cause that helmet
is from another planet.

36:55.713 --> 36:57.006
It's millions of years old.

36:57.090 --> 36:58.716
It chooses who it lets touch it.

37:00.301 --> 37:01.970
- Like Kent?
- Yeah.

37:02.053 --> 37:05.432
Like, Kent is literally
possessed when he puts it on.

37:05.515 --> 37:06.850
What happens
if I touch it anyway?

37:06.933 --> 37:10.186
Soul crushing terror?
Or... something.

37:10.270 --> 37:12.981
So we should probably
put a towel on it, right?

37:13.064 --> 37:14.357
Coming up on it.

37:14.441 --> 37:16.776
Ready stations in five.

37:16.860 --> 37:19.237
Hey, why is this Adam dude
so pissed off?

37:19.320 --> 37:20.572
He's not some dude.

37:20.655 --> 37:23.783
He's a weapon
of mass destruction.

37:23.867 --> 37:25.869
You don't have to
raise your hand.

37:25.952 --> 37:28.392
Question, if he's so powerful,
how are we supposed
to stop him?

37:28.455 --> 37:31.374
If we can get him
to say the word, "shazam,"

37:31.458 --> 37:33.543
teth Adam will lose his power.

37:33.626 --> 37:34.961
And we're hoping since he's had

37:35.044 --> 37:37.422
a few thousand years
to sleep it off,

37:37.505 --> 37:40.842
we can peacefully negotiate
the terms of his existence.

37:40.925 --> 37:43.028
From the footage you showed us,
he doesn't really seem like

37:43.052 --> 37:44.929
a "peacefully negotiate"
kind of guy.

37:45.013 --> 37:46.264
Correct.

37:46.347 --> 37:47.347
Look alive.

37:50.185 --> 37:51.185
We're here.

38:33.019 --> 38:34.187
Forgive me.

38:48.076 --> 38:49.452
This is a message

38:49.536 --> 38:51.055
- for all intergang soldiers.
- Hey! Stop!

38:51.079 --> 38:53.331
Kahndaq has its own
official superhero now.

39:17.355 --> 39:18.565
Teth Adam!

39:20.692 --> 39:22.694
Please.

39:22.777 --> 39:25.780
There he is! Move!

39:25.863 --> 39:27.532
- Teth Adam!
- Move!

39:28.533 --> 39:29.659
Teth Adam...

39:31.202 --> 39:33.663
Get up! Who's gonna
save you now, mate?

39:36.583 --> 39:37.667
The statue?

39:39.919 --> 39:41.462
That's my son.

39:41.546 --> 39:43.673
He's just a boy.
He doesn't know
what he's doing.

39:44.799 --> 39:45.799
What are you doing?

39:46.759 --> 39:49.387
Hang on. I recognize you.

39:49.470 --> 39:51.097
Where is the crown?

39:52.181 --> 39:53.975
Let's go!

40:08.656 --> 40:09.842
You could've showed up
a bit sooner.

40:09.866 --> 40:10.866
But that was dope.

40:16.664 --> 40:17.664
We need backup down here.

40:58.748 --> 41:00.541
Tell them
the man in black sent you.

41:00.625 --> 41:03.503
Well, yes, but not to me.
Say it to the bad guys.

41:04.462 --> 41:05.672
But before you zap them.

41:05.755 --> 41:07.507
- Catchphrase, then kill.
- Yes.

41:30.279 --> 41:31.155
He's here.

41:31.239 --> 41:32.532
You sense his presence?

41:32.615 --> 41:34.867
No.

41:34.951 --> 41:38.162
I assume he's the only person
in kahndaq that can do that.

41:48.923 --> 41:51.467
Fate and I'll take
the lead. Listen...

41:51.551 --> 41:53.886
Now, you two hang back
till we call you.

41:53.970 --> 41:55.596
We're the anvil,
you're the hammer.

41:55.680 --> 41:57.348
You're ready.

41:57.432 --> 41:59.076
Uh, he just dropped the, um...

41:59.100 --> 42:00.893
Shit!

42:06.899 --> 42:07.984
Be prepared.

42:15.616 --> 42:16.616
Um...

42:28.880 --> 42:30.131
Behind you!

42:43.853 --> 42:45.021
Let us be!

42:46.647 --> 42:48.900
I don't know their crimes,
but whatever they are,

42:48.983 --> 42:50.860
these men should face
due process.

42:55.198 --> 42:56.866
Then let the gods
make their judgment.

42:56.949 --> 42:58.284
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

42:58.367 --> 43:00.578
You don't look like
an intergang.

43:00.661 --> 43:03.122
We're the justice society.

43:03.206 --> 43:06.417
Our mission is to protect
global stability.

43:06.501 --> 43:09.921
We're here to restore peace
to kahndaq.

43:10.004 --> 43:13.049
And we will use force
if necessary.

43:15.176 --> 43:17.011
Force is always necessary.

43:17.094 --> 43:18.638
Teth Adam.

43:18.721 --> 43:22.225
We know who you are
and what you are capable of.

43:22.308 --> 43:24.769
There's no place for you
in the world of man.

43:26.145 --> 43:27.355
You have two choices.

43:28.105 --> 43:29.816
Kneel or die.

43:31.275 --> 43:32.985
I was a slave until I died.

43:34.821 --> 43:36.197
Then I was reborn a god.

43:38.491 --> 43:40.159
I kneel before no one.

43:47.625 --> 43:49.293
Fate, give me a distraction.

44:42.346 --> 44:45.391
Just say, "shazam."
We all go home.

44:47.643 --> 44:49.020
I don't have a home.

45:21.886 --> 45:22.887
Whoo!

45:22.970 --> 45:24.388
Look at that suit. It's cool.

45:24.472 --> 45:26.265
- Thanks. You, too.
- Thank you.

45:26.349 --> 45:28.267
It was a hand-me-down.
It was from my uncle.

45:34.774 --> 45:36.494
Hawkman just
does not give up, does he?

45:36.525 --> 45:37.525
Nope.

45:50.581 --> 45:52.917
Amon, where are you going?
Wait!

45:53.000 --> 45:54.168
To help him!

46:15.064 --> 46:17.608
Cyclone, smasher,
now is your time.

46:17.692 --> 46:19.402
Let's roll!

46:19.485 --> 46:21.005
What are you doing?
Hey! Hey, hey, hey!

47:02.695 --> 47:03.988
No!

47:09.618 --> 47:10.618
I'll be right there!

47:20.296 --> 47:22.048
You have the crown of sabbac.

48:05.424 --> 48:06.984
I can't hold him much longer.

48:12.598 --> 48:13.599
Move!

48:34.870 --> 48:37.057
I'm coming!
I'm zeroing in on your location!

49:09.113 --> 49:12.408
I got him! Guys, I got him.

49:12.491 --> 49:15.661
It's, uh... it's me, al.
In case you didn't
recognize me.

49:15.744 --> 49:17.224
There's something different
about you.

49:17.288 --> 49:18.956
Can't quite put my finger on it.

49:19.039 --> 49:20.809
You know, it's probably because
I'm six stories tall now.

49:20.833 --> 49:22.293
But you, you're like a tornado.

49:22.376 --> 49:24.920
I thought the two of you
did great work.

49:25.004 --> 49:26.922
- First time out...
- Bravo.

49:27.006 --> 49:29.341
Thanks. I mean, I got a little
turned around back there,

49:29.425 --> 49:30.801
but, uh,
it all worked out, right?

49:30.885 --> 49:32.511
You're damn right it did.

49:32.595 --> 49:34.395
Let's hope waller has
that cell ready for him.

49:40.186 --> 49:42.730
You want me
to keep my hand here, right?

49:42.813 --> 49:44.398
You'd better not let him up.

49:45.900 --> 49:48.694
Uh... what do I... what do I do?
Guys?

49:52.823 --> 49:53.823
Woo-hoo!

50:05.669 --> 50:08.005
Long live the champion!

50:08.088 --> 50:10.341
Long live the champion!

50:10.424 --> 50:12.468
Long live the champion!

50:12.551 --> 50:14.762
Long live the champion!

50:22.603 --> 50:25.648
Yeah, he's definitely
still breathing.

50:25.731 --> 50:29.985
Long live the champion!
Long live the champion!

50:48.587 --> 50:50.464
Where are you going?
We need to go after him.

50:50.547 --> 50:52.716
We're not strong enough.

50:52.800 --> 50:55.487
Oh, well, maybe next time
use your powers of prediction
to figure that out

50:55.511 --> 50:57.096
before we get our asses kicked.

50:57.179 --> 50:58.764
I'm working on it.

50:58.847 --> 51:00.266
Miss?

51:00.349 --> 51:01.989
Excuse me, you mind
if I look in your bag?

51:02.017 --> 51:03.269
Yes, I do mind.

51:03.352 --> 51:04.770
Where are you going
with this, Kent?

51:04.853 --> 51:06.272
She's got the crown of sabbac.

51:06.355 --> 51:08.023
One catastrophe at a time.

51:08.107 --> 51:09.542
We can't give him
a chance to regroup.

51:09.566 --> 51:11.360
He's been spotted
entering the palace.

51:11.443 --> 51:13.487
It's safe to say he's not
going there to surrender.

51:13.570 --> 51:15.281
Why do you want
teth Adam to surrender?

51:15.364 --> 51:17.491
He's the champion of kahndaq.
Who are you?

51:17.574 --> 51:19.493
The justice society?

51:19.576 --> 51:21.829
We have been living
under military occupation

51:21.912 --> 51:24.498
for 27 years,
and never seen you before.

51:24.581 --> 51:27.209
You didn't come
when intergang
invaded our country,

51:27.293 --> 51:29.878
when they stole our resources
and killed my husband.

51:29.962 --> 51:32.464
But now, we finally
have our own hero

51:32.548 --> 51:35.801
and you decide
to fly down here
and save us?

51:35.884 --> 51:38.178
Thank you, but...
We're covered.

51:38.262 --> 51:41.849
Go and protect
international stability
someplace else.

51:41.932 --> 51:44.601
Oh, and second,
I don't have the crown.

51:44.685 --> 51:46.603
Let me spell it out for you.

51:46.687 --> 51:48.647
Teth Adam can't be
kahndaq's champion

51:48.731 --> 51:50.190
because he is not a hero.

51:50.274 --> 51:52.401
Tell that...

51:52.484 --> 51:56.405
To all the people
he just liberated.

51:56.488 --> 51:58.824
I know what this looks like.
I... I do.

51:58.907 --> 52:00.200
But I can assure you that my...

52:03.746 --> 52:06.248
I am so sorry.
Was that expensive?

52:07.916 --> 52:10.210
Me and you.
When we get back to the ship...

52:10.294 --> 52:12.212
- Yes, sir.
- Me and you.

52:12.296 --> 52:13.296
I...

52:14.673 --> 52:16.216
Can we please
just see the crown?

52:17.051 --> 52:18.093
I don't have it.

52:36.737 --> 52:38.197
We don't have time for this.

52:38.280 --> 52:40.282
Teth Adam first, then the crown.

52:40.366 --> 52:42.785
You don't have
any authority here.

52:42.868 --> 52:44.078
Teth Adam has done nothing...

52:44.161 --> 52:46.830
Teth Adam is not
who you think he is.

52:46.914 --> 52:48.332
And how would you know?

52:48.415 --> 52:50.000
We have access to ancient texts

52:50.084 --> 52:51.960
that have been kept secret
for centuries.

52:52.044 --> 52:54.630
And what exactly do these
supposed ancient texts say?

52:54.713 --> 52:58.967
They say that his rage
nearly destroyed kahndaq.

52:59.051 --> 53:00.386
And we flew
all the way over here

53:00.469 --> 53:02.763
to stop it from happening again.

53:05.849 --> 53:07.369
You want to go in there alone?

53:07.393 --> 53:09.186
Are you sure?

53:09.269 --> 53:11.855
You want to go in
and fight teth Adam again,
be my guest.

53:11.939 --> 53:14.274
But if you actually want
to resolve things peacefully,

53:14.358 --> 53:16.318
without destroying
the rest of my city,

53:16.402 --> 53:17.402
I'm your only shot.

53:40.676 --> 53:42.511
You brought
the invaders with you.

53:42.594 --> 53:44.721
They only want to talk.

53:44.805 --> 53:48.100
They can talk. I won't listen.

53:50.060 --> 53:52.396
When I was a little girl,
my grandmother
told me the story

53:52.479 --> 53:55.441
of how the champion came
to this exact spot

53:55.524 --> 53:57.276
to free the enslaved people
of kahndaq

53:57.359 --> 53:59.486
by defeating king ahk-ton
in battle.

53:59.570 --> 54:01.572
But according
to the justice society,

54:01.655 --> 54:03.449
that's not really what happened.

54:03.532 --> 54:06.118
They say that you didn't
come here to seek justice.

54:08.787 --> 54:10.707
Hurry. Give it to me!

54:15.169 --> 54:17.379
That you came to exact revenge.

54:33.228 --> 54:34.605
And in your anger...

54:36.690 --> 54:42.154
Don't kill me.
I can give you anything you want.

54:42.237 --> 54:44.031
This is what I want.

54:44.114 --> 54:46.825
Your power grew
until it became uncontrollable.

54:54.041 --> 54:57.127
And the council of wizards
was forced to deem you unworthy

54:57.211 --> 54:59.379
of the gifts that
you were granted.

54:59.463 --> 55:01.465
We have chosen recklessly...

55:01.548 --> 55:03.842
And humanity has paid the price.

55:03.926 --> 55:07.137
And now, teth Adam...
You must pay.

55:27.032 --> 55:29.368
It wasn't your tomb
that I opened, was it?

55:32.454 --> 55:33.914
It was your prison.

55:35.499 --> 55:38.335
And, now, there's
a statue of you.

55:38.418 --> 55:42.089
Out of the hope that
someday kahndaq's champion
would return.

55:42.172 --> 55:43.799
But it's built on a lie,
isn't it?

55:43.882 --> 55:45.884
I never said I was a hero.

55:45.968 --> 55:48.178
I never claimed to be anything.

55:48.262 --> 55:50.722
You may not have been a hero.

55:50.806 --> 55:53.308
But that doesn't mean
that you can't be one now.

56:00.816 --> 56:02.359
I will hear them out.

56:02.442 --> 56:04.570
But if they choose to fight,
they choose to die.

56:10.576 --> 56:12.327
Uncle karim!

56:12.411 --> 56:13.680
I can't believe
you're sitting around
watching TV

56:13.704 --> 56:15.024
when the most epic day ever is...

56:15.080 --> 56:17.332
In here, little man.

56:19.293 --> 56:21.545
Ishmael! My mom said
you got buried in the tomb.

56:21.628 --> 56:22.879
Funny story, he didn't.

56:22.963 --> 56:25.132
Where's Adrianna?

56:25.215 --> 56:26.425
She's back at the square...

56:26.508 --> 56:27.652
We should go bail her out
right now.

56:27.676 --> 56:28.778
But she's the one
who sent me home

56:28.802 --> 56:30.002
to make sure the crown's safe.

56:30.053 --> 56:31.638
It is safe, okay?
Somewhere else.

56:31.722 --> 56:34.224
Definitely not here. Let...

56:34.308 --> 56:35.743
- Put the bag down.
- What are you doing?

56:35.767 --> 56:38.353
Back away.
Put the bag down, now.

56:41.898 --> 56:43.275
Give him the bag.
Give him the bag.

56:45.152 --> 56:46.152
Very good. Back away.

56:47.613 --> 56:49.239
- Back away.
- Okay, i'm...

56:59.207 --> 57:01.376
It's all going
to be okay, little man.

57:01.460 --> 57:03.580
Let me teach you
some history that
you've never learned

57:03.629 --> 57:05.088
in one of your mother's classes.

57:05.172 --> 57:06.840
When we had a powerful king,

57:06.923 --> 57:10.260
kahndaq used to be something
much better than free.

57:10.344 --> 57:11.803
It used to be great.

57:11.887 --> 57:13.430
Run, amon, run!

57:32.240 --> 57:33.408
Crash the building.

57:33.492 --> 57:35.160
I lost the kid.
He has the crown.

57:51.259 --> 57:53.136
We're here
to negotiate the terms

57:53.220 --> 57:55.681
of your peaceful surrender.

57:55.764 --> 57:59.017
I'm not peaceful.
Nor do I surrender.

57:59.101 --> 58:01.311
What have
your powers ever given to you?

58:01.395 --> 58:03.480
Nothing but heartache.

58:03.563 --> 58:05.023
You have no idea.

58:05.107 --> 58:06.733
Then why are you
making this hard on us?

58:06.817 --> 58:08.860
We both know you're not
supposed to be here.

58:08.944 --> 58:11.571
It is you who is not supposed
to be here.

58:11.655 --> 58:13.907
I want you all
to leave kahndaq
and never return.

58:13.990 --> 58:17.828
Gladly,
with you as our prisoner.

58:17.911 --> 58:20.455
How 'bout I rip
your little wings off instead?

58:20.539 --> 58:22.416
I'd like to see you try.

58:22.499 --> 58:23.939
Okay, more fighting
won't solve this.

58:24.000 --> 58:25.502
- I disagree.
- Me, too.

58:25.585 --> 58:27.045
Looks like we found
common ground.

58:27.129 --> 58:28.922
This can only end one way.

58:30.549 --> 58:31.967
- Mom?
- Amon.

58:32.050 --> 58:33.885
I got home and ishmael
was in the kitchen.

58:33.969 --> 58:35.387
Ishmael's dead.

58:35.470 --> 58:37.430
No, he shot uncle karim,
and he's after the crown.

58:38.807 --> 58:40.392
Ground forces...

58:40.475 --> 58:42.395
I'm hiding in our building,
and intergang's here.

58:42.477 --> 58:44.187
They're coming!

58:44.271 --> 58:46.273
Intergang are after my son.

58:46.356 --> 58:49.526
They don't want him,
they want the crown of sabbac.

58:49.609 --> 58:50.819
I know you're not a hero.

58:50.902 --> 58:52.088
But you're not a monster,
either.

58:52.112 --> 58:53.321
I don't care what anyone says.

58:53.405 --> 58:55.741
You saved me in that cave.

58:55.824 --> 58:58.744
You didn't know me
and your first instinct
was to save me.

58:58.827 --> 59:01.455
I'm begging you.
Please, save my son.

59:06.001 --> 59:07.353
Check the whole place clean.

59:07.377 --> 59:09.463
Cover all access points!

59:09.546 --> 59:11.882
Keep looking!

59:19.473 --> 59:20.473
Area's clear.

59:21.767 --> 59:23.351
There! There!
Take him! Take him!

59:23.435 --> 59:24.875
Right there, right there!

59:27.481 --> 59:28.982
Move, move!

59:29.065 --> 59:31.568
Don't shoot him, I need him!

59:40.160 --> 59:41.920
He's going down,
he's going down!

59:49.544 --> 59:50.796
End of the road, kid!

59:58.678 --> 59:59.930
Release the child.

1:00:00.013 --> 1:00:01.431
Whatever you say.

1:00:04.559 --> 1:00:06.394
Yes! Thank you!

1:00:06.478 --> 1:00:09.231
But maybe be more careful
with your word choice
next time.

1:00:12.275 --> 1:00:14.486
Oh! And remember
your catchphrase!

1:00:19.533 --> 1:00:21.326
Time to go, amon.

1:00:28.583 --> 1:00:30.210
- Where's the crown?
- What crown?

1:00:30.293 --> 1:00:32.838
- You want to be brave, eh?
- I want you to go to hell.

1:00:32.921 --> 1:00:34.297
That's the plan, little man.

1:00:34.381 --> 1:00:36.091
We're gonna go for a ride.
Come on.

1:00:50.939 --> 1:00:52.941
Put me down! Put me down!

1:00:53.024 --> 1:00:55.211
You should really be
more careful with
your word choice next time.

1:00:55.235 --> 1:00:56.838
And tell them that
the man in black...

1:01:03.368 --> 1:01:05.453
He's right behind me.
Where the hell is everybody?

1:01:16.006 --> 1:01:17.257
Mom?

1:01:17.340 --> 1:01:20.135
Amon, where are you?
No, no, no. What?

1:01:20.218 --> 1:01:21.928
I'm in one of their bikes.

1:01:22.012 --> 1:01:23.012
What bikes?

1:01:42.198 --> 1:01:43.366
Amon!

1:01:43.450 --> 1:01:44.284
Can you hear me?

1:01:44.367 --> 1:01:45.535
Mom, I'm okay.

1:01:52.250 --> 1:01:53.250
Shit!

1:01:59.799 --> 1:02:01.009
Activate infrared.

1:02:07.140 --> 1:02:08.200
What are you doing?

1:02:08.224 --> 1:02:09.601
Searching for the child.

1:02:09.684 --> 1:02:10.977
No, you're murdering people.

1:02:11.061 --> 1:02:12.687
How else do I find the child?

1:02:12.771 --> 1:02:14.940
I can help you, but no more
extrajudicial killings.

1:02:15.023 --> 1:02:16.775
I don't need any help.

1:02:19.069 --> 1:02:20.546
Smasher, cyclone!

1:02:20.570 --> 1:02:21.988
What are you waiting for?

1:02:22.072 --> 1:02:24.157
- Come on, let's go!
- Uh, okay.

1:02:24.240 --> 1:02:26.326
Okay. I got this. I got this.
On the count of three.

1:02:26.409 --> 1:02:28.078
One, two...

1:02:28.161 --> 1:02:30.288
This feels a lot higher
than last time.

1:02:30.372 --> 1:02:32.415
Whoa!

1:02:32.499 --> 1:02:33.750
Ah! That was not cool!

1:02:42.509 --> 1:02:44.229
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey.

1:02:44.260 --> 1:02:45.804
Hey, guys. Slow down.

1:02:49.349 --> 1:02:51.518
I got you! I got you!

1:03:10.245 --> 1:03:13.248
Hey, careful, dude!
I almost hit you.

1:03:19.254 --> 1:03:20.839
I am so sorry. I just...

1:03:20.922 --> 1:03:22.233
I don't really have
peripheral vision in the mask.

1:03:22.257 --> 1:03:23.925
It's my uncle's.
I'll get it tailored.

1:03:24.009 --> 1:03:25.260
Me and you.

1:03:25.343 --> 1:03:26.469
Roger that.

1:04:11.222 --> 1:04:13.391
- Who are you?
- Call me Dr. Fate.

1:04:13.475 --> 1:04:16.936
How bad is it, doc? Am I dying?

1:04:17.020 --> 1:04:18.605
I'm not that kind of doctor.

1:04:18.688 --> 1:04:20.315
But don't worry,
I can see the future.

1:04:20.398 --> 1:04:22.442
This isn't how you're
going to die.

1:04:22.525 --> 1:04:23.777
How do I die, then?

1:04:23.860 --> 1:04:25.570
Just stay away from electricity.

1:04:25.653 --> 1:04:28.656
Wait, what? I'm an electrician.

1:04:28.740 --> 1:04:30.220
How the hell
am I supposed to do that?

1:05:37.976 --> 1:05:40.436
Oh, god.

1:05:40.520 --> 1:05:42.564
The champion's coming for you.
You know that, right?

1:05:42.647 --> 1:05:43.647
I'm counting on it.

1:05:55.285 --> 1:05:56.953
Please don't.

1:05:57.036 --> 1:05:58.788
Teth Adam. Where are you?

1:05:58.872 --> 1:05:59.873
You followed me?

1:05:59.956 --> 1:06:01.666
My mind and body can exist

1:06:01.749 --> 1:06:03.751
in different places
at the same time.

1:06:03.835 --> 1:06:05.420
Did you find the boy?

1:06:05.503 --> 1:06:07.064
Caught one of the bikes,
but he didn't have the child.

1:06:07.088 --> 1:06:09.591
Bring me the prisoner.
I'll break his mind.

1:06:09.674 --> 1:06:10.675
Uh...

1:06:12.302 --> 1:06:14.137
You killed him, didn't you?

1:06:21.186 --> 1:06:22.187
He didn't make it.

1:06:25.231 --> 1:06:26.471
The bullet's extracted.

1:06:26.524 --> 1:06:28.484
The tissue damage
has been repaired.

1:06:28.568 --> 1:06:32.947
Blood pressure, 120 over 81.
Heart rate's at 74 bpm.

1:06:33.031 --> 1:06:34.471
He'll be back on his feet
in no time.

1:06:36.659 --> 1:06:37.659
That is insane.

1:06:38.995 --> 1:06:40.997
The nanobots did
most of the work.

1:06:41.080 --> 1:06:43.291
No, no, no. I'm not gonna
let you downplay this.

1:06:43.374 --> 1:06:45.376
I literally just witnessed
a miracle.

1:06:45.460 --> 1:06:46.961
Mmm-mmm.

1:06:47.045 --> 1:06:48.713
What? I say something stupid?

1:06:48.796 --> 1:06:51.591
No, it's just you can transform
your molecular structure,

1:06:51.674 --> 1:06:53.384
grow a hundred times
your own size.

1:06:53.468 --> 1:06:55.628
You're an impossibility
and the world still amazes you.

1:06:55.678 --> 1:06:57.180
I don't know, it's...

1:06:58.181 --> 1:06:59.181
It's cool.

1:07:00.391 --> 1:07:02.477
Thank you.

1:07:02.560 --> 1:07:03.853
But it's not as cool
as nanobots.

1:07:06.189 --> 1:07:08.316
That's how you do
your wind thing.

1:07:08.399 --> 1:07:10.985
Well, the "wind thing"
is called aerokinesis.

1:07:11.069 --> 1:07:13.005
And the nanobots were injected
into my bloodstream

1:07:13.029 --> 1:07:14.489
by this really
messed-up scientist

1:07:14.572 --> 1:07:15.949
who kidnapped me when I was 15.

1:07:20.078 --> 1:07:21.663
I'm... so sorry.

1:07:22.872 --> 1:07:24.249
No, you're good.

1:07:24.332 --> 1:07:26.084
It seems like you
really turned it around.

1:07:26.167 --> 1:07:27.502
Found your calling.

1:07:28.920 --> 1:07:29.963
Hoping this is mine.

1:07:36.386 --> 1:07:38.388
There's no point
in dwelling in the past.

1:07:41.140 --> 1:07:42.809
It's already moved on from you.

1:07:47.105 --> 1:07:48.564
Why did you say that?

1:07:48.648 --> 1:07:51.192
You were blaming yourself
for trusting ishmael.

1:07:51.276 --> 1:07:54.445
Your thoughts are better spent
on the things you can change,

1:07:54.529 --> 1:07:55.613
not those you can't.

1:07:56.948 --> 1:07:58.741
You see the future?

1:07:58.825 --> 1:08:00.618
Tell me how I get my son back.

1:08:02.036 --> 1:08:03.204
By trusting us.

1:08:03.288 --> 1:08:06.582
Karim will live.
We will save amon.

1:08:06.666 --> 1:08:07.750
It's what we do.

1:08:12.964 --> 1:08:15.300
I suppose
they didn't have doors
in your day.

1:08:15.383 --> 1:08:18.720
Well, of course we did.
That's how we entered rooms.

1:08:18.803 --> 1:08:20.805
What I did there
is called sarcasm.

1:08:20.888 --> 1:08:23.057
Where is amon?
Did you find him?

1:08:23.141 --> 1:08:24.350
Not yet, but I will.

1:08:24.434 --> 1:08:25.714
The men who took him
will suffer.

1:08:27.520 --> 1:08:28.560
Maybe these guys can help.

1:08:30.732 --> 1:08:33.234
There's an upside
to keeping prisoners.

1:08:33.318 --> 1:08:35.111
They can answer our questions.

1:08:35.194 --> 1:08:36.571
What did you do with my son?

1:08:45.288 --> 1:08:47.832
Adrianna. Adrianna.

1:08:47.915 --> 1:08:49.542
I've learned that
in this modern world,

1:08:49.625 --> 1:08:51.044
we shouldn't hurt our prisoners.

1:08:51.127 --> 1:08:52.807
We should treat them
with dignity, respect.

1:08:54.130 --> 1:08:56.132
No.

1:08:56.215 --> 1:08:58.110
Let's start with
just one simple question.

1:08:58.134 --> 1:09:00.970
Can either of you fly?

1:09:01.054 --> 1:09:02.555
Shit.

1:09:04.307 --> 1:09:05.725
I think I'll sit this one out.

1:09:13.066 --> 1:09:15.693
Tell me what you did with amon.

1:09:15.777 --> 1:09:17.987
You'd better not drop
those prisoners.

1:09:18.071 --> 1:09:19.530
I'm not going to drop them.

1:09:21.616 --> 1:09:23.159
I'm going to drop one of them.

1:09:23.242 --> 1:09:25.620
Whoever answers first lives.
Where is he?

1:09:25.703 --> 1:09:27.288
I don't know.

1:09:33.628 --> 1:09:35.296
He's at our mine in the desert.

1:09:35.380 --> 1:09:36.839
I can show...

1:09:42.220 --> 1:09:44.013
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

1:09:46.432 --> 1:09:48.032
You said you wouldn't hurt
the prisoners.

1:09:48.059 --> 1:09:49.852
That was sarcasm.

1:09:49.936 --> 1:09:52.313
No, technically,
it was just a lie.

1:09:52.397 --> 1:09:53.791
Intergang have a mine
in the desert.

1:09:53.815 --> 1:09:55.108
- Amon is there.
- I know it.

1:09:55.191 --> 1:09:57.402
It's near
the al hadidiyah mountains.

1:09:57.485 --> 1:09:58.486
Let's go.

1:10:00.071 --> 1:10:02.198
I told you, stop killing people!

1:10:02.281 --> 1:10:03.199
They look alive to me.

1:10:03.282 --> 1:10:05.159
Because I saved them.

1:10:05.243 --> 1:10:06.970
Well, that's why I waited
until you were there.

1:10:06.994 --> 1:10:09.038
I got the information I needed,
no one died.

1:10:10.123 --> 1:10:11.416
I did it your way.

1:10:11.499 --> 1:10:12.542
He does have a point.

1:10:14.001 --> 1:10:15.878
I know it got lost
in all the confusion,

1:10:15.962 --> 1:10:18.673
but we still have some issues
to settle here.

1:10:18.756 --> 1:10:20.258
We know where amon is.
We have to go.

1:10:20.341 --> 1:10:21.968
There is no "we" here.

1:10:22.051 --> 1:10:25.096
There are only heroes
and there are villains.

1:10:26.389 --> 1:10:27.932
You think yourself a hero,

1:10:28.015 --> 1:10:29.618
but you would let
these criminals go free,

1:10:29.642 --> 1:10:31.644
knowing that many more
will suffer at their hands

1:10:31.727 --> 1:10:32.812
unless we end them now.

1:10:32.895 --> 1:10:35.565
Heroes don't kill people.

1:10:39.360 --> 1:10:40.360
Well, I do.

1:10:41.904 --> 1:10:42.947
Here we go.

1:11:44.383 --> 1:11:47.386
Is that what I think it is?

1:11:47.470 --> 1:11:49.388
Twenty-three pounds
of pure eternium,

1:11:49.472 --> 1:11:51.891
much denser than
typical artifacts
of the period.

1:11:51.974 --> 1:11:53.726
King must have had
a really strong neck.

1:11:53.809 --> 1:11:55.603
No, it snapped
when I killed him.

1:11:57.813 --> 1:11:59.232
What's that?

1:11:59.315 --> 1:12:00.876
There's writing on the inside
of the rim.

1:12:00.900 --> 1:12:03.027
"Life is the only path
to death."

1:12:04.028 --> 1:12:05.238
That's what it says.

1:12:05.321 --> 1:12:08.491
"Life is the only path
to death."

1:12:08.574 --> 1:12:11.619
Well, that's
surprisingly obvious.

1:12:11.702 --> 1:12:13.371
Could it have another meaning?

1:12:13.454 --> 1:12:15.414
What if it means, like, um...

1:12:15.498 --> 1:12:17.708
"Life is short.

1:12:17.792 --> 1:12:19.192
You gotta hold on
to what you love."

1:12:21.128 --> 1:12:22.128
Stop.

1:12:22.713 --> 1:12:23.839
Deep.

1:12:23.923 --> 1:12:25.508
It doesn't matter what it means.

1:12:25.591 --> 1:12:27.361
It should be buried
under the ocean for eternity.

1:12:27.385 --> 1:12:29.095
That's not far from what
we had in mind

1:12:29.178 --> 1:12:30.596
for you when this is over.

1:12:30.680 --> 1:12:32.098
Or I could Bury you with it.

1:12:33.766 --> 1:12:35.601
We can't get rid of it now.

1:12:35.685 --> 1:12:37.311
It's the one thing
that intergang wants.

1:12:37.395 --> 1:12:40.106
Believe me,
I know more than anyone

1:12:40.189 --> 1:12:41.732
what this crown is capable of.

1:12:41.816 --> 1:12:44.819
But we have to keep it
until my son is safe.

1:12:44.902 --> 1:12:46.112
Adrianna...

1:12:46.195 --> 1:12:47.947
Trust me,
we will get your son back.

1:12:48.030 --> 1:12:50.741
They don't care about him.
They just want to defeat me.

1:12:50.825 --> 1:12:52.034
Hand it over.

1:12:53.911 --> 1:12:57.331
We can't risk letting the crown
fall into the wrong hands.

1:12:58.708 --> 1:13:00.418
We'll find another way.

1:13:01.752 --> 1:13:03.546
No.

1:13:03.629 --> 1:13:06.257
You like to split the world
into good and bad,

1:13:06.340 --> 1:13:09.719
but that's easy to do
when you're the one
drawing the line.

1:13:09.802 --> 1:13:11.679
All I care about is amon.

1:13:11.762 --> 1:13:15.850
And until he is safe,
we're all on the same side.

1:13:15.933 --> 1:13:19.061
And you...
You will work together.

1:13:26.527 --> 1:13:29.322
Set a course
for the al hadidiyah mountains.

1:13:29.405 --> 1:13:30.698
We'll go in at dawn.

1:13:32.074 --> 1:13:33.993
I hope you can be a team player.

1:13:34.076 --> 1:13:36.245
I love teams.

1:13:36.329 --> 1:13:37.913
That was sarcasm again, yes?

1:13:37.997 --> 1:13:38.914
Very much so.

1:13:38.998 --> 1:13:41.334
Good. Just checking.

1:13:51.886 --> 1:13:54.305
A wise man
once told me a bad plan

1:13:54.388 --> 1:13:55.806
is better than no plan at all.

1:13:55.890 --> 1:13:59.060
That was before we had
a very bad plan.

1:13:59.143 --> 1:14:01.062
Let it go.

1:14:01.145 --> 1:14:03.648
I'd rather be fighting with him
than against him.

1:14:03.731 --> 1:14:05.566
He's a murderer, Kent.

1:14:05.650 --> 1:14:09.028
If he turns on us,
that kid is as good as dead.

1:14:09.111 --> 1:14:12.073
You don't get to decide
who lives or dies.

1:14:13.324 --> 1:14:15.409
That's... up to fate.

1:14:15.493 --> 1:14:16.952
What's the helmet telling you?

1:14:18.120 --> 1:14:19.205
Somebody's gonna die.

1:14:20.748 --> 1:14:23.376
Who is it, atom smasher?
It's atom smasher.

1:14:23.459 --> 1:14:24.585
Surprisingly, no.

1:14:25.878 --> 1:14:26.878
Is it me?

1:14:33.177 --> 1:14:36.597
When it's time for you and I
to say goodbye, you'll know.

1:14:39.517 --> 1:14:40.851
All I can tell you is,

1:14:43.145 --> 1:14:45.398
there's still time
to change the future.

1:14:46.649 --> 1:14:47.733
Let's use it.

1:14:48.651 --> 1:14:49.652
Hmm.

1:14:53.406 --> 1:14:56.158
Well, I guess we're sticking
with the very bad plan.

1:15:08.671 --> 1:15:09.964
The al hadidiyah mine

1:15:10.047 --> 1:15:13.592
is intergang's
most valued asset.

1:15:13.676 --> 1:15:15.010
I'm gonna land us right here,

1:15:15.094 --> 1:15:17.221
cut off their access
to reinforcements.

1:15:17.304 --> 1:15:20.307
But the perimeter of the mine
creates a natural fortress.

1:15:20.391 --> 1:15:22.852
There's only one way in,
one way out.

1:15:22.935 --> 1:15:24.663
We'll be an easy target
for their flybike patrol.

1:15:24.687 --> 1:15:26.397
Communication is key.

1:15:26.480 --> 1:15:28.899
We keep in step
or we get outflanked.

1:15:28.983 --> 1:15:31.193
We move through the mine,
inch by inch,

1:15:31.277 --> 1:15:32.778
until we find amon.

1:15:32.862 --> 1:15:34.902
This is where you come in.
Are you ready... damn it.

in that 21st century ♪

1:15:40.619 --> 1:15:42.371

Pure eternium shield.

1:16:09.940 --> 1:16:12.193
Unbreakable,
even with your powers.

1:16:19.742 --> 1:16:21.076
Amon!

1:16:21.160 --> 1:16:22.828
You hurt him,
I will kill all of you.

1:16:22.912 --> 1:16:25.748
Nobody has to die.
We just want the crown.

1:16:25.831 --> 1:16:27.792
We don't have it.

1:16:27.875 --> 1:16:31.837
Believe me, nothing good
will come from that crown.

1:16:33.798 --> 1:16:36.300
No crown, no negotiation.

1:16:37.718 --> 1:16:38.718
I have it.

1:16:40.846 --> 1:16:42.848
It's right here.

1:16:42.932 --> 1:16:45.684
Release my son, you can have it.

1:16:48.729 --> 1:16:50.147
What do you think you're doing?

1:16:51.774 --> 1:16:54.235
Intergang killed my husband.

1:16:54.318 --> 1:16:56.070
I'm not letting them
take my son, too.

1:17:01.742 --> 1:17:04.286
Not your son. Not your country.

1:17:05.913 --> 1:17:07.122
Not your decision to make.

1:17:08.624 --> 1:17:10.084
Stop there!

1:17:10.167 --> 1:17:12.962
It's okay.
Nothing is gonna happen to you.

1:17:13.045 --> 1:17:14.171
Hand it over, now.

1:17:15.422 --> 1:17:16.465
I'm sorry, mom.

1:17:16.549 --> 1:17:17.633
No.

1:17:23.472 --> 1:17:24.890
Now, let amon go.

1:17:31.188 --> 1:17:33.028
I thank you.
And I thank your friends

1:17:33.107 --> 1:17:36.902
for returning the crown
to its rightful owner.

1:17:36.986 --> 1:17:40.656
What kind of
champion of kahndaq
sides with foreign invaders?

1:17:40.739 --> 1:17:41.991
You have what you want.

1:17:43.200 --> 1:17:44.451
Let him go.

1:17:44.535 --> 1:17:45.828
Ishmael, what are you doing?

1:17:45.911 --> 1:17:48.622
Taking back what's mine.

1:17:48.706 --> 1:17:51.584
I'm the last living descendant
of king ahk-ton the great.

1:17:51.667 --> 1:17:54.253
And you have just given me
everything I need

1:17:54.336 --> 1:17:57.882
to become the next
king of kahndaq.

1:17:59.550 --> 1:18:01.510
My family passed
the knowledge on, you know,

1:18:01.594 --> 1:18:03.304
one to the next.

1:18:03.387 --> 1:18:06.599
The crown,
crafted by our ancestors,

1:18:06.682 --> 1:18:09.351
stolen by the wizards
and hidden away.

1:18:09.435 --> 1:18:11.228
But still a source
of great power,

1:18:11.312 --> 1:18:13.856
if only we can wield it.

1:18:19.028 --> 1:18:23.574
They say when hurut died,
you wept like a baby.

1:18:25.075 --> 1:18:26.595
I wonder if you'll
do the same for them.

1:18:26.619 --> 1:18:27.619
Please, ishmael.

1:18:27.661 --> 1:18:28.829
Sorry, amon.

1:18:31.498 --> 1:18:32.999
Fate, get ready.

1:18:33.083 --> 1:18:37.171
Death is the only path to life.

1:18:41.091 --> 1:18:42.426
Amon!

1:19:48.617 --> 1:19:49.785
Amon!

1:19:52.913 --> 1:19:54.707
He's alive.

1:19:54.790 --> 1:19:56.500
But we need to get him
to the medical bay.

1:19:56.583 --> 1:19:58.183
- Where is he shot?
- It wasn't a bullet.

1:19:58.252 --> 1:19:59.252
It was me.

1:20:08.554 --> 1:20:09.554
Come.

1:20:19.314 --> 1:20:21.275
We're going with you.

1:20:21.358 --> 1:20:23.485
Just find the crown.
Get it on the cruiser.

1:20:36.331 --> 1:20:39.209
I found the crown.
But, um... it's not alone.

1:20:50.804 --> 1:20:52.681
How long we gonna
keep doing this?

1:20:56.351 --> 1:20:59.605
There's no point in fighting.
We both know
no one can stop me.

1:21:01.315 --> 1:21:02.441
You're right.

1:21:03.650 --> 1:21:05.944
Only you can.

1:21:06.028 --> 1:21:08.781
Ishmael said you cried
when hurut died.

1:21:13.577 --> 1:21:14.745
Who's hurut?

1:21:20.250 --> 1:21:22.169
Hurut was a true champion
of kahndaq.

1:21:28.175 --> 1:21:30.427
And he was also... my son.

1:21:32.721 --> 1:21:34.949
I won't always be here
to protect you.

1:21:34.973 --> 1:21:38.268
I don't need protection.
I want to be free.

1:21:40.062 --> 1:21:41.271
Freedom is for the birds.

1:21:41.355 --> 1:21:44.316
Let someone else be the hero...

1:21:44.399 --> 1:21:47.319
The graveyards are full of them.

1:21:52.282 --> 1:21:54.094
I tried to protect him.

1:22:01.625 --> 1:22:03.145
But I wasn't strong enough.

1:22:07.756 --> 1:22:11.093
Shazam!

1:22:11.176 --> 1:22:14.930
The wizards
decided that he would be
their champion.

1:22:15.013 --> 1:22:17.349
But after the champion's
many victories,

1:22:17.432 --> 1:22:20.310
the king went after
what hurut loved the most.

1:22:22.354 --> 1:22:24.439
Our family.

1:22:41.874 --> 1:22:45.294
Hold on, father.
Stay with me.

1:22:52.551 --> 1:22:57.181
With my powers...
You'll be safe.

1:22:57.264 --> 1:22:59.183
I couldn't protect your mother.

1:23:00.225 --> 1:23:02.603
Repeat what I say.

1:23:03.562 --> 1:23:04.688
- Shazam.
- Shazam.

1:23:17.784 --> 1:23:19.944
Instead of battling the king...

1:23:20.954 --> 1:23:22.831
Instead of saving kahndaq...

1:23:24.291 --> 1:23:25.959
Hurut chose to save...

1:23:27.336 --> 1:23:28.336
Me.

1:23:45.437 --> 1:23:47.522
But he couldn't save himself

1:23:47.606 --> 1:23:49.983
from the king's assassins.

1:23:52.527 --> 1:23:55.113
The powers were not a gift
from the wizards...

1:23:56.156 --> 1:23:57.156
But a curse.

1:24:07.376 --> 1:24:09.962
Born... out of rage.

1:24:12.923 --> 1:24:14.883
The statue of the champion
isn't you.

1:24:18.136 --> 1:24:19.221
It's hurut.

1:24:22.391 --> 1:24:24.268
My son dreamt of a better world.

1:24:25.727 --> 1:24:27.062
That's why he saved me.

1:24:32.067 --> 1:24:34.152
But the world was only
a better place with him in it.

1:24:50.460 --> 1:24:51.837
Kahndaq needed a hero.

1:24:53.630 --> 1:24:55.215
Instead, it got me.

1:24:58.218 --> 1:24:59.553
All this power...

1:25:01.305 --> 1:25:04.599
And the only thing
I can do with it
is hurt people.

1:25:04.683 --> 1:25:07.185
I will speak the word
my son gave me,

1:25:07.269 --> 1:25:08.687
and I will give up my power.

1:25:11.481 --> 1:25:15.027
And when I do, you must ensure
I never speak it again.

1:25:20.907 --> 1:25:22.200
Shazam.

1:25:30.083 --> 1:25:33.670
Some men
are not meant... to be heroes.

1:26:18.882 --> 1:26:20.217
Hey!

1:26:38.360 --> 1:26:40.362
So beautiful.

1:27:06.805 --> 1:27:08.390
Surprised to see us?

1:27:08.473 --> 1:27:11.476
Surprise is a dirty word
in this business.

1:27:11.560 --> 1:27:13.061
Are you sure you can handle him?

1:27:14.563 --> 1:27:16.040
You're the one who can
see the future,

1:27:16.064 --> 1:27:17.315
you'll tell me if we can't.

1:27:17.399 --> 1:27:19.860
Just be careful with this one.

1:27:19.943 --> 1:27:22.362
You know,
they say the gods created us,

1:27:22.446 --> 1:27:24.865
but we're the ones
who always wind up
burying them.

1:27:26.825 --> 1:27:28.243
Waller sends her regards.

1:27:35.333 --> 1:27:37.294
They'll know
how to deal with him.

1:27:37.377 --> 1:27:40.005
To keep him
from regaining his powers,

1:27:40.088 --> 1:27:41.923
they'll keep him
in suspended animation.

1:27:49.639 --> 1:27:52.893
As long as he's submerged,
he won't be able to speak.

1:27:57.856 --> 1:27:59.524
He'll never say
another word again.

1:28:19.044 --> 1:28:21.505
Hey! There he is.

1:28:21.588 --> 1:28:25.175
Not all heroes wear capes,
but I think you earned this.

1:28:25.258 --> 1:28:26.885
Well, statistically,

1:28:26.968 --> 1:28:29.054
most heroes don't wear capes.
But, yeah, try it on.

1:28:32.682 --> 1:28:34.726
Yeah, looks pretty good.

1:28:37.437 --> 1:28:39.064
That's a nice touch.

1:29:19.604 --> 1:29:20.604
Kent.

1:29:22.274 --> 1:29:23.400
Kent!

1:29:26.736 --> 1:29:27.862
Mission accomplished?

1:29:27.946 --> 1:29:30.240
My vision hasn't changed.

1:29:30.323 --> 1:29:32.492
But teth Adam's
out of the equation.

1:29:32.576 --> 1:29:35.245
Kent, if this isn't over,
I need to know what's coming.

1:29:35.328 --> 1:29:36.955
What is the helmet telling you?

1:29:38.582 --> 1:29:41.876
My vision has always shown me
a great calamity.

1:29:41.960 --> 1:29:44.004
The world in flames.

1:29:44.087 --> 1:29:45.380
We can stop it...

1:29:47.215 --> 1:29:48.216
But you die.

1:29:50.719 --> 1:29:51.970
You should've told me sooner.

1:29:55.348 --> 1:29:57.183
I have no fear of death.

1:29:57.267 --> 1:29:59.269
That's precisely
why I didn't tell you.

1:29:59.352 --> 1:30:01.605
The world needs
the justice society.

1:30:01.688 --> 1:30:03.523
The world needs you.

1:30:03.607 --> 1:30:06.526
But you can't choose
who lives and dies.

1:30:06.610 --> 1:30:07.610
That's fate, right?

1:30:10.989 --> 1:30:12.407
That sounds familiar.

1:30:15.410 --> 1:30:17.287
I remember seeing
my first airplane.

1:30:19.122 --> 1:30:24.044
It was an raf deployment,
headed to the western front.

1:30:24.127 --> 1:30:26.338
Everyone on my street
came out to see them off.

1:30:26.963 --> 1:30:28.673
Mmm.

1:30:28.757 --> 1:30:29.841
But I didn't cheer.

1:30:31.843 --> 1:30:34.512
Even though I was only a boy.

1:30:34.596 --> 1:30:39.100
I knew where they were headed,
and what awaited them.

1:30:39.184 --> 1:30:40.602
Thanks to this,
I've lived longer

1:30:40.685 --> 1:30:42.854
than I could've
ever have hoped for.

1:30:42.937 --> 1:30:44.522
I've seen the world change

1:30:44.606 --> 1:30:46.566
in more ways
than I could've imagined.

1:30:49.819 --> 1:30:51.696
I'm still a sentimental fool.

1:30:53.239 --> 1:30:54.991
And I don't want
my friend to die.

1:31:03.208 --> 1:31:08.088
Ishmael said, "death
is the only path to life."

1:31:08.171 --> 1:31:10.382
But that's not
what the inscription says.

1:31:10.465 --> 1:31:13.760
Right. "Life is
the only path to death."

1:31:13.843 --> 1:31:15.261
Maybe he got it backwards,

1:31:15.345 --> 1:31:17.597
like he read it in a mirror
or something.

1:31:17.681 --> 1:31:19.182
That's it.

1:31:19.265 --> 1:31:21.559
In kahndaqi mythology,
the souls of the damned

1:31:21.643 --> 1:31:23.728
are sent
to the rock of finality.

1:31:23.812 --> 1:31:25.897
The underworld
is a mirror to our own.

1:31:25.980 --> 1:31:27.732
Here, turn the crown around.

1:31:29.401 --> 1:31:30.694
Now mirror the letters.

1:31:30.777 --> 1:31:33.822
See? That's what I missed.

1:31:33.905 --> 1:31:37.909
"Death is
the only path to life."

1:31:41.871 --> 1:31:44.165
He kidnapped amon on purpose,

1:31:44.249 --> 1:31:46.751
because he knew
that teth Adam would kill him.

1:31:46.835 --> 1:31:48.878
And he believed
the champion's magic

1:31:48.962 --> 1:31:50.797
would send him
to the rock of finality.

1:31:50.880 --> 1:31:54.426
As life is the path to death.

1:31:54.509 --> 1:31:58.263
Now your death
is a path to life.

1:31:58.346 --> 1:32:00.432
The wizards have their champion,

1:32:00.515 --> 1:32:02.642
now we have ours.

1:32:02.726 --> 1:32:05.478
You will take
the throne of kahndaq

1:32:05.562 --> 1:32:09.607
and unleash hell on earth!

1:32:09.691 --> 1:32:11.776
Speak our name.

1:32:12.402 --> 1:32:13.402
"Sabbac."

1:32:34.799 --> 1:32:36.801
What the bloody hell is that?

1:32:36.885 --> 1:32:38.645
Readout says
it's the demon, sabbac.

1:32:38.678 --> 1:32:41.014
Get me closer. Now, right now!

1:32:41.097 --> 1:32:42.807
We're 100 miles out,
give me 20 seconds!

1:32:50.315 --> 1:32:55.695
The king has returned!
The throne will be mine!

1:32:58.198 --> 1:32:59.407
Brace yourselves!

1:33:05.371 --> 1:33:06.498
Hold on!

1:33:43.535 --> 1:33:44.845
Now prepare to die.

1:33:51.042 --> 1:33:52.322
Wait, wait, where's uncle karim?

1:34:09.227 --> 1:34:12.230
No matter
what happens, he does not
sit on that throne.

1:34:15.692 --> 1:34:17.336
- Copy that.
- We're on it!

1:34:17.360 --> 1:34:18.360
Heads up!

1:35:03.156 --> 1:35:04.240
Activate infrared.

1:35:08.077 --> 1:35:09.829
Sabbac, show yourself!

1:35:12.248 --> 1:35:15.084
Adrianna! Amon!

1:35:19.464 --> 1:35:20.924
That's for my cruiser.

1:35:59.545 --> 1:36:00.546
This is it.

1:36:02.048 --> 1:36:03.675
We can't win, Carter.

1:36:03.758 --> 1:36:06.761
Yeah, but the world burns
if we don't. Right?

1:36:09.013 --> 1:36:11.265
Bad plan is better than
no plan at all.

1:36:38.251 --> 1:36:40.253
No, no, no. What are you doing?

1:36:40.336 --> 1:36:42.130
Giving us a third option.

1:36:42.213 --> 1:36:43.631
It's supposed to be me.

1:36:43.715 --> 1:36:45.842
I didn't tell you
my whole vision, old friend.

1:36:46.884 --> 1:36:48.302
I did see your death.

1:36:48.386 --> 1:36:50.763
But I also found a way
to prevent it.

1:36:50.847 --> 1:36:52.890
It has been
an extraordinary life,

1:36:52.974 --> 1:36:55.309
but always with one foot
in the future.

1:36:55.393 --> 1:36:58.604
Carter, for the first time
in 100 years,

1:36:58.688 --> 1:36:59.856
when I look ahead...

1:37:02.608 --> 1:37:03.818
I see nothing.

1:37:03.901 --> 1:37:04.902
No, Kent.

1:37:04.986 --> 1:37:05.986
And...

1:37:06.946 --> 1:37:07.947
It's...

1:37:08.948 --> 1:37:09.782
Beautiful.

1:37:09.866 --> 1:37:10.908
Wait, Kent!

1:37:10.992 --> 1:37:12.118
Goodbye...

1:37:12.201 --> 1:37:13.911
Kent!

1:37:13.995 --> 1:37:15.079
My dear friend.

1:37:15.163 --> 1:37:16.247
Kent!

1:37:19.042 --> 1:37:20.418
Hit it from every side.

1:37:22.253 --> 1:37:24.547
Kent!

1:37:27.258 --> 1:37:28.342
No!

1:37:48.071 --> 1:37:53.201
I am Dr. Fate, sorcerer,
agent of the lords of order,

1:37:53.284 --> 1:37:56.329
defender against darkness
and chaos,

1:37:56.412 --> 1:37:58.915
but even my powers
cannot defeat you.

1:38:09.092 --> 1:38:11.385
There's no one
that can defeat me.

1:38:15.807 --> 1:38:19.560
There is one... there is one...

1:38:20.228 --> 1:38:21.312
Teth Adam.

1:38:22.772 --> 1:38:24.315
I know you can hear me.

1:38:26.275 --> 1:38:30.071
The battle your son
was meant to fight is upon us.

1:38:30.154 --> 1:38:32.448
Now you are the only one

1:38:32.532 --> 1:38:34.742
who can defeat
the demon champion.

1:39:00.935 --> 1:39:02.270
You have the power

1:39:02.353 --> 1:39:04.480
to be the destroyer
of this world.

1:39:07.650 --> 1:39:10.403
But you can also be its savior.

1:39:27.420 --> 1:39:30.256
You believe
you are not a worthy champion

1:39:30.339 --> 1:39:32.925
because the wizards
did not choose you.

1:39:33.009 --> 1:39:36.721
But fate does not
make mistakes.
Neither did your son.

1:39:40.892 --> 1:39:42.518
We were wrong about you.

1:39:42.602 --> 1:39:45.855
The world doesn't always need
a white knight.

1:39:45.938 --> 1:39:47.940
Sometimes it needs
something darker.

1:40:04.081 --> 1:40:06.626
Don't you dare
give up on us now.

1:40:06.709 --> 1:40:08.211
The world needs you.

1:41:15.319 --> 1:41:16.319
Kent!

1:41:26.038 --> 1:41:27.081
No!

1:42:31.687 --> 1:42:34.023
Mom? What's happening?

1:42:36.484 --> 1:42:38.235
It's sabbac.

1:42:38.319 --> 1:42:40.363
He commands the legions of hell.

1:42:40.446 --> 1:42:41.447
Whatever happens...

1:42:43.324 --> 1:42:44.658
You stay behind me.

1:42:55.711 --> 1:42:56.837
♪ Baby, come back ♪

1:42:59.256 --> 1:43:01.550
Don't worry,
I die by electricity!

1:43:03.344 --> 1:43:06.138
You want some kahndaq?
Come and get it!

1:43:06.222 --> 1:43:07.890
Come and get it!

1:43:07.973 --> 1:43:09.433
No, no. No.

1:43:09.517 --> 1:43:11.602
- Don't send me home,
I can help.
- I know.

1:43:11.685 --> 1:43:13.521
But you can do better
than swinging a stick.

1:43:52.351 --> 1:43:55.521
The gods
have brought us together again.

1:43:57.481 --> 1:44:00.151
It's not your time, father.

1:44:03.237 --> 1:44:04.237
Hey!

1:44:05.614 --> 1:44:07.054
What are you all
standing around for?

1:44:08.242 --> 1:44:09.285
This is our chance.

1:44:12.913 --> 1:44:15.958
With these hands,
we built kahndaq.

1:44:16.041 --> 1:44:18.127
And with these hands,
we will set it free!

1:44:24.383 --> 1:44:26.093
The people need a hero.

1:44:27.970 --> 1:44:32.141
No, father.
They need to be free.

1:44:36.270 --> 1:44:37.480
What are we waiting for?

1:45:00.628 --> 1:45:02.671
Say the word.

1:45:03.714 --> 1:45:05.174
Shazam.

1:45:15.851 --> 1:45:18.646
The people of kahndaq
rise up against you!

1:45:47.383 --> 1:45:48.383
Yes!

1:45:51.470 --> 1:45:53.556
I got this.

1:45:55.558 --> 1:45:56.558
Go get him.

1:46:14.368 --> 1:46:15.869
You know what I have to do.

1:46:17.705 --> 1:46:19.206
Beat his ass!

1:46:19.290 --> 1:46:21.500
Let the fate of kahndaq
be decided

1:46:21.584 --> 1:46:24.378
by a true battle of champions.

1:46:25.254 --> 1:46:26.254
Let's end this.

1:46:52.865 --> 1:46:54.074
It's a lot of them.

1:46:55.701 --> 1:46:57.661
- It's a bit more
than I thought.
- Yeah.

1:46:58.412 --> 1:46:59.872
Just a bit.

1:47:07.296 --> 1:47:08.296
Hey, mom!

1:47:15.971 --> 1:47:19.016
These are our streets!
Our city!

1:47:20.809 --> 1:47:22.936
Free kahndaq!

1:47:30.611 --> 1:47:33.197
The wizards' powers
were wasted on you.

1:47:33.280 --> 1:47:35.240
You are not a hero.

1:47:37.910 --> 1:47:40.371
No. I'm not.

1:47:41.789 --> 1:47:44.124
But he is.

1:47:55.552 --> 1:47:57.763
You cannot stand against me.

1:47:57.846 --> 1:48:00.057
I am kahndaq's true champion.

1:48:10.109 --> 1:48:12.194
I learned this trick
from an old friend.

1:48:51.859 --> 1:48:53.193
You can control it!

1:48:57.448 --> 1:48:58.782
You have to!

1:49:10.043 --> 1:49:11.587
Tell them
the man in black sent you.

1:49:37.321 --> 1:49:38.906
- Yes!
- Yes!

1:50:02.137 --> 1:50:04.681
I never thought I'd be happy
to see you.

1:50:07.851 --> 1:50:09.186
I'm only here because of him.

1:50:12.564 --> 1:50:14.274
That makes two of us.

1:50:31.708 --> 1:50:33.544
See you around, old friend.

1:50:48.892 --> 1:50:50.372
Think you can keep him
out of trouble?

1:50:50.435 --> 1:50:52.354
As long as no one
comes looking for it.

1:50:52.437 --> 1:50:53.480
Fair enough.

1:50:55.482 --> 1:50:57.317
Just be careful.

1:50:57.401 --> 1:51:00.362
The kind of justice
you dish out
can darken your soul.

1:51:00.445 --> 1:51:02.865
It's his darkness
that lets him do

1:51:02.948 --> 1:51:05.576
what heroes like you cannot.

1:51:07.452 --> 1:51:09.079
I guess we'll find out,
won't we?

1:51:17.713 --> 1:51:20.090
I thought we made
a pretty good team back there.

1:51:20.173 --> 1:51:21.173
Just saying.

1:51:22.885 --> 1:51:23.969
We made a great team.

1:51:30.350 --> 1:51:32.269
- Maybe we could...
- Don't push it.

1:51:32.352 --> 1:51:33.604
Smasher, let's go.

1:51:45.824 --> 1:51:48.201
Long live the champion!

1:51:48.285 --> 1:51:53.332
Long live the champion!
Long live the champion!

1:51:55.751 --> 1:51:56.919
You could lead them.

1:52:30.953 --> 1:52:32.037
How does it feel?

1:52:34.247 --> 1:52:35.247
Wrong.

1:52:46.635 --> 1:52:48.762
So, what now?

1:52:48.845 --> 1:52:51.139
Does this mean you're finally
gonna be our hero?

1:52:51.223 --> 1:52:53.100
Kahndaq has always had heroes.

1:52:54.434 --> 1:52:56.645
And it still does.

1:52:56.728 --> 1:52:59.272
What it needs now
is a protector.

1:52:59.356 --> 1:53:01.108
Thank you, teth Adam.

1:53:01.191 --> 1:53:04.194
Perhaps that name is a little...

1:53:04.277 --> 1:53:05.278
Old-fashioned.

1:53:06.613 --> 1:53:07.693
So what should we call you?

1:56:03.623 --> 1:56:05.417
Okay, "black Adam."

1:56:06.585 --> 1:56:08.670
My name is Amanda waller.

1:56:08.753 --> 1:56:11.423
Congratulations,
you have my attention.

1:56:11.506 --> 1:56:15.427
This is gonna be
your only warning.

1:56:15.510 --> 1:56:18.346
You don't want to stay
in my prison, that's fine.

1:56:18.430 --> 1:56:21.016
Kahndaq is your prison now.

1:56:21.099 --> 1:56:24.811
You step one foot
outside of it, you will
not live to regret it.

1:56:27.063 --> 1:56:29.149
There's no one on this planet
that can stop me.

1:56:29.232 --> 1:56:31.032
I can call in a favor
and send people

1:56:31.109 --> 1:56:32.819
who aren't from this planet.

1:56:34.988 --> 1:56:35.988
Send them all.

1:56:38.074 --> 1:56:39.159
As you wish.

1:56:54.216 --> 1:56:57.636
It's been a while
since anyone's made
the world this nervous.

1:57:03.725 --> 1:57:04.725
Black Adam.

1:57:06.269 --> 1:57:07.270
We should talk.
