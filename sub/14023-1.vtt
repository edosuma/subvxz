00:37.922 --> 00:40.117
Doomed planet.

00:41.159 --> 00:43.150
Servo cells are out. We're dropping.

00:48.366 --> 00:50.960
Desperate scientists.

00:53.338 --> 00:57.069
Approaching photosphere.
Increase stabilizers.

00:59.444 --> 01:01.275
Last hope.

01:02.747 --> 01:04.977
Pressure index, 55 up.

01:10.154 --> 01:12.213
Kindly couple.

01:16.527 --> 01:18.586
Superman.

01:26.804 --> 01:29.568
Gravity shields are failing, Dr. Quintum.

01:29.907 --> 01:31.898
We're falling directly into the sun.

01:32.443 --> 01:36.140
When we hit the convection zone, the
temperature will reach 40 million degrees.

01:36.748 --> 01:39.216
I'm not ready to die just yet.

01:41.719 --> 01:43.346
Pity.

01:52.263 --> 01:53.730
You killed your brother.

01:56.000 --> 01:58.059
- I did.
- That should be impossible.

01:58.236 --> 02:00.101
I genetically engineered you myself.

02:00.271 --> 02:03.138
Your code has been modified
by a superior intellect.

02:03.307 --> 02:05.605
- Now I'm a biological time bomb.
- But...

02:05.777 --> 02:10.372
I'm death, courtesy of Lex Luthor.

02:15.620 --> 02:16.712
How big is it?

02:16.888 --> 02:21.951
From where I'm standing,
one can only hope it's proportional.

02:22.694 --> 02:25.527
"Superman saves mission to the sun"?

02:25.697 --> 02:27.358
We don't know that yet, Lois.

02:27.532 --> 02:30.194
I always write Superman stories
before they happen.

02:30.368 --> 02:32.461
If you don't know how big the sun is,
go away.

02:32.637 --> 02:35.868
It's 333,000 times the size of the Earth.

02:36.040 --> 02:38.031
Uh, uhh... Uh. Wuh.

02:39.711 --> 02:41.804
I looked it up
on my Superman signal watch.

02:41.979 --> 02:43.105
Thanks, Jimmy.

02:43.448 --> 02:46.474
It's like a hundred billion nuclear bombs
exploding every second.

02:46.651 --> 02:48.915
You working undercover on a story?

02:49.087 --> 02:51.282
No, why?

02:52.323 --> 02:54.917
Lex Luthor told the world
he'd reformed.

02:55.093 --> 02:58.256
And despite our best efforts,
the world believed him.

02:58.696 --> 03:00.664
That's not exactly breaking news, chief.

03:01.032 --> 03:02.590
No, but this is.

03:02.767 --> 03:05.497
Luthor's been investing heavily
in water rights.

03:05.670 --> 03:07.399
Kent's boring story.

03:07.572 --> 03:09.733
The devil's in the details, Lombard.

03:09.907 --> 03:13.240
Luthor planned to cash in
on a global water shortage...

03:13.411 --> 03:17.507
a shortage he intended to create
by somehow tampering with the sun.

03:17.682 --> 03:20.014
This is tomorrow's front page.

03:20.184 --> 03:22.652
We finally got that son of a bitch.

03:24.756 --> 03:27.122
I'm approaching critical mass.

03:32.063 --> 03:34.827
Lex, I just got a call
from Media Relations.

03:34.999 --> 03:36.967
The Daily Planet's asking for a comment.

03:38.302 --> 03:40.862
Fusion will occur in 30 seconds.

03:41.038 --> 03:43.802
Are you talking to yourself again?

03:45.476 --> 03:47.808
I'm remote-controlling a weapon.

03:47.979 --> 03:50.140
The signal takes nine minutes
to reach the sun.

03:50.314 --> 03:52.942
I have to coordinate
my transmissions perfectly.

03:53.117 --> 03:54.141
The sun?

03:54.318 --> 03:58.015
You were released from jail to work
for your country, not on your own...

03:59.524 --> 04:03.187
I know I promised not to waste my intellect
on elaborate super deathtraps.

04:04.562 --> 04:05.995
I know that.

04:07.298 --> 04:09.960
Magnetic seals are decoupling.
The ship's coming apart.

04:10.134 --> 04:11.965
I'm approaching critical mass.

04:12.136 --> 04:13.865
Somebody help us.

04:15.873 --> 04:18.899
But I looked in the mirror one morning
and realized something.

04:19.076 --> 04:21.874
I'm getting older, and he isn't.

04:22.046 --> 04:25.482
Something's gotta be done about that.
Don't you think?

04:30.221 --> 04:32.712
Fusion will occur in 30 seconds.

04:32.890 --> 04:34.380
Not in here, it won't.

04:40.698 --> 04:41.995
Quintum, blow the hatch.

05:14.265 --> 05:16.893
- Where's that shield coming from?
- It's Superman.

05:17.068 --> 05:20.970
Somehow, he's extending
his own bioelectric field.

05:39.790 --> 05:41.382
It seems impossible.

05:41.559 --> 05:45.723
But it isn't.
You're lifting 200 quintillion tons.

05:45.897 --> 05:48.161
Even allowing
for the one-sixth normal gravity...

05:48.332 --> 05:51.563
here on my moon base,
that's three times your record.

05:51.736 --> 05:53.226
I feel like I could do more.

05:53.404 --> 05:56.134
No doubt, but that's
the heaviest apparatus known to man.

05:56.307 --> 05:59.470
Add to that the new super-power
you exhibited when you saved me...

05:59.644 --> 06:02.977
and it's obvious
your body is changing radically.

06:04.682 --> 06:07.913
Superman, I'm not sure
how to tell you this.

06:10.254 --> 06:12.085
Tell me straight.

06:12.523 --> 06:16.425
Your trip to the sun overexposed
your cells to solar radiation...

06:16.594 --> 06:19.927
more than even your body
can metabolize.

06:20.932 --> 06:25.369
I see it,
like tiny fireworks beneath my skin.

06:25.670 --> 06:28.662
Your cells are oversaturated with power.

06:28.839 --> 06:31.364
They're bursting from within.

06:35.579 --> 06:36.944
I'm dying.

06:37.615 --> 06:38.775
I'm sorry, Superman.

06:38.950 --> 06:43.114
If I hadn't tried to steal fire from the
sun, none of this would have happened.

06:43.654 --> 06:44.951
Don't apologize.

06:45.122 --> 06:47.386
- You couldn't have known.
- But he knew.

06:47.558 --> 06:49.958
It was his plan all along.

06:50.127 --> 06:52.891
Luthor used me to kill you.

06:56.100 --> 07:01.197
We engineer new forms of humanity here
for the eventual betterment of mankind.

07:01.372 --> 07:03.897
You're our inspiration, Superman.

07:04.075 --> 07:07.511
And I promise,
we'll find a way to save you.

07:08.980 --> 07:11.915
- I need a favor, Dr. Quintum.
- Anything.

07:12.817 --> 07:17.220
My condition. Don't tell anyone, not yet.

07:17.955 --> 07:20.924
There are some things I have to do first.

07:21.225 --> 07:23.022
Great Caesar's ghost!

07:23.194 --> 07:27.324
"Wait," he says.
"Exclusive interview," he says.

07:27.498 --> 07:31.525
If Clark Kent doesn't show up
in the next five seconds, he's fired.

07:31.702 --> 07:36.105
Five, four, three...

07:37.675 --> 07:40.143
two, one.

07:40.311 --> 07:41.710
Hold the presses... Oop!

07:43.514 --> 07:45.448
Where the hell have you been, Kent?

07:45.916 --> 07:48.749
Uh, working on my suntan?

07:52.423 --> 07:55.085
Freeze. Hands above your head.

08:00.164 --> 08:03.133
Lex Luthor, you are under arrest
for attempted murder...

08:03.300 --> 08:04.927
and crimes against humanity.

08:05.469 --> 08:10.429
By all means, boys, take me away.

08:19.817 --> 08:21.785
He was smiling when they nabbed him.

08:22.086 --> 08:24.077
Said something
about friends in high places.

08:24.255 --> 08:27.486
- That does seem odd.
- The Court of International Justice...

08:28.993 --> 08:32.258
is talking about reinstating
the electric chair just for him.

08:32.830 --> 08:34.491
Do you ever think about death, Lois?

08:34.664 --> 08:36.326
Don't be morbid, Smallville.

08:37.735 --> 08:38.962
I'm so sorry.

08:39.135 --> 08:42.572
Idiot. Your boyfriend's an idiot.

08:42.740 --> 08:45.732
How dare you? And he's not my idiot.

08:46.610 --> 08:47.634
Why, thanks, Lois.

08:47.812 --> 08:50.337
I don't know where my self-esteem
would be without you.

08:50.514 --> 08:51.947
Alone, in front of the TV.

08:52.650 --> 08:54.015
Come on, Clark.

09:04.295 --> 09:06.490
Thanks for carrying all this stuff.

09:06.664 --> 09:08.996
Lois, there was something
I wanted to tell you.

09:09.166 --> 09:13.125
If it's about the trial coverage,
it can wait till tomorrow. I've gotta fly.

09:15.639 --> 09:19.370
Lois, I have something to tell you.

09:28.919 --> 09:30.648
You're Clark Kent?

09:30.821 --> 09:32.413
I'm Clark Kent.

09:32.590 --> 09:36.856
Sorry, Superman, but you've
got to admit, that's very hard to believe.

09:49.707 --> 09:52.642
All the years I spent trying to prove
you were Superman...

09:52.810 --> 09:54.903
You almost had me a couple of times.

09:55.079 --> 09:57.843
And you turn around and just tell me?

10:08.993 --> 10:11.461
What happened to that big golden key
you used to have?

10:11.629 --> 10:14.029
Didn't think it was secure enough.

10:18.402 --> 10:21.269
Good afternoon, Superman.
May we be of assistance?

10:21.572 --> 10:26.271
Please bring Miss Lane's car inside
and repair any damage from the flight.

10:30.281 --> 10:31.771
That key can't be safe.

10:32.483 --> 10:34.075
Why don't you give it a try?

10:41.358 --> 10:43.519
I carved it out of a piece
of dwarf star material.

10:43.694 --> 10:45.286
It weighs half a million tons.

10:47.531 --> 10:49.931
So you're the only one who can lift it.

10:50.100 --> 10:52.295
I work pretty hard, Lois.

10:53.370 --> 10:57.101
It's important to have
someplace private to relax.

11:20.664 --> 11:22.097
How's the water?

11:22.266 --> 11:23.927
Mm. Perfect.

11:24.101 --> 11:26.331
- You're not looking, are you?
- Lois.

11:26.503 --> 11:29.267
Well, to be honest,
if the situation were reversed...

11:29.640 --> 11:31.665
I'd never take advantage, Lois.

11:36.614 --> 11:39.082
So is this a date?

11:40.217 --> 11:45.416
I mean, is all this for my birthday,
or are we about to get serious here?

11:46.156 --> 11:48.090
Superman?

11:53.297 --> 11:55.060
These are for you.

11:55.232 --> 11:57.257
I picked them on Alpha Centauri IV.

11:59.670 --> 12:01.501
They sing.

12:08.345 --> 12:10.279
I didn't know you collected modern art.

12:10.781 --> 12:12.942
Actually, I do, but this is the armory.

12:13.284 --> 12:16.412
I've confiscated some incredibly
destructive weapons over the years.

12:16.587 --> 12:22.651
There are things here that can even hurt me,
like this Kryptonite laser or this gravity gun.

12:23.060 --> 12:25.995
I hope none of your enemies
find out about this place.

12:26.163 --> 12:28.131
They'd do anything to kill you.

12:28.299 --> 12:30.563
That's not a problem, Lois.

12:33.170 --> 12:35.900
My fortress
is only for the people closest to me.

12:41.178 --> 12:42.702
Come see my new Time Telescope.

12:47.318 --> 12:48.342
What's it do?

12:48.519 --> 12:51.352
Lets me talk to my descendants
in the far future.

12:51.522 --> 12:54.320
That's Kal Kent,
the Superman of the 84th century.

12:54.758 --> 12:58.558
We fought the mad god Darkseid
in the year 8315.

12:58.996 --> 13:00.623
I'm still working out the bugs...

13:00.798 --> 13:04.598
but someday, I'll be able to use it
to stop threats before they happen.

13:04.768 --> 13:06.531
He looks a little like my dad.

13:06.704 --> 13:09.002
A thousand warriors, valiant and true.

13:09.640 --> 13:11.369
And this is a Sun-Eater.

13:11.542 --> 13:15.979
I found it wandering in orbit near Jupiter.
Poor thing would have starved.

13:16.146 --> 13:18.979
- Ech. What do you feed him?
- Suns.

13:19.149 --> 13:21.845
Little ones I make here
on my Cosmic Anvil.

13:23.554 --> 13:24.578
He's just a baby.

13:32.896 --> 13:34.727
Here you go.

13:40.437 --> 13:42.302
What's in here?

14:14.605 --> 14:16.004
What the hell?

14:17.374 --> 14:20.275
- Lois, stay out of there.
- I didn't mean to.

14:20.444 --> 14:23.072
You can go anywhere in the fortress
except for this room.

14:25.416 --> 14:26.747
It's off-limits.

14:30.154 --> 14:33.248
It's not too early for dinner.
Why don't we eat?

14:36.293 --> 14:39.820
What do you think?
I've been restoring it in my spare time.

14:40.197 --> 14:41.858
It's good to have hobbies, I guess.

14:42.633 --> 14:43.691
What are you wearing?

14:43.867 --> 14:47.530
Traditional Kryptonian formalwear.
I made it myself.

14:48.205 --> 14:52.073
Shipbuilding, fashion design.
You're a man of many talents.

14:52.242 --> 14:54.301
I just feel like trying things.

14:54.711 --> 14:57.202
My trip to the sun,
it not only tripled my strength...

14:57.381 --> 15:01.283
it tripled my curiosity,
my imagination, my creativity.

15:01.452 --> 15:03.511
Did it triple your honesty?

15:03.687 --> 15:07.680
Is that why you're suddenly telling me
the truth about your secret identity?

15:08.358 --> 15:09.791
No, that's not why.

15:09.960 --> 15:11.689
But you are telling the truth.

15:12.362 --> 15:13.795
Yes.

15:14.097 --> 15:16.895
Okay, how do you explain the time
Clark was a witness...

15:17.067 --> 15:19.763
in the Boss Grimaldi trial
and you were his bodyguard?

15:19.937 --> 15:21.529
Batman was standing in for me.

15:21.905 --> 15:24.840
And when Clark presented you
with the key to the city...

15:25.008 --> 15:26.532
that was Batman too?

15:26.710 --> 15:27.734
A robot.

15:27.911 --> 15:30.778
Lois, whenever I misled you,
it was for your own protection.

15:30.948 --> 15:32.973
But now I'm telling you the truth.

15:33.150 --> 15:36.813
Clark Kent and Superman
are one and the same.

15:36.987 --> 15:38.921
If you're telling me the truth now...

15:39.089 --> 15:41.887
doesn't that mean
you've been lying to me for years?

15:54.104 --> 15:56.868
For the first time,
I see our whole freakish relationship...

15:57.040 --> 15:58.473
in stark black and white.

15:58.642 --> 16:03.272
And I have to ask myself,
why would he lie to me?

16:04.147 --> 16:05.808
Thirsty.

16:07.551 --> 16:10.452
All these new powers
and his new super-intellect.

16:10.888 --> 16:13.049
What if he's grown tired
of his little game...

16:13.223 --> 16:15.953
fooling people who love him
just to feel superior.

16:21.098 --> 16:23.430
What if he's brought me here
for some experiment...

16:23.600 --> 16:25.795
that he's planning in that secret room?

16:36.880 --> 16:38.575
I need a weapon.

16:46.990 --> 16:49.151
It all makes sense now.

16:49.326 --> 16:52.386
He's brought me here to be
the mother of a race of super-children.

16:52.563 --> 16:54.258
Can't let that happen.

16:54.431 --> 16:56.422
They'll grow up and lie to everybody.

17:05.175 --> 17:06.608
May I be of service, Miss La...?

17:15.519 --> 17:16.747
He knows I'm here.

17:18.021 --> 17:19.146
Gotta stop him.

17:21.491 --> 17:23.288
God forgive me, I've gotta stop him.

17:41.645 --> 17:44.512
Huh. Tickles.

17:44.915 --> 17:46.314
What have I done?

17:46.483 --> 17:50.249
For one thing, you've confirmed
my suspicion that I'm immune to Kryptonite.

17:50.420 --> 17:53.787
- I'll take that, if you don't mind.
- I don't understand what's happening.

17:53.957 --> 17:57.586
Robot 7 seems to have malfunctioned.
I'll check him out later.

17:57.761 --> 18:01.595
In the meantime, he left the door open
while I was synthesizing some chemicals.

18:01.765 --> 18:04.962
They can cause visual distortion
and paranoia.

18:05.302 --> 18:07.293
I saw a dissection machine.

18:07.471 --> 18:10.338
A sewing machine,
for weaving indestructible thread.

18:10.507 --> 18:12.372
The paranoia should pass momentarily.

18:13.143 --> 18:14.576
I am feeling better.

18:14.745 --> 18:18.203
I'm sorry I kept leaving you alone,
but I was making your birthday present.

18:18.382 --> 18:21.146
And it took me longer than I thought
to read and memorize...

18:21.318 --> 18:23.582
the 8 billion characters
in your genetic code.

18:23.754 --> 18:27.690
- What are you talking about?
- I guess the surprise is already spoiled.

18:28.291 --> 18:30.851
This serum is keyed
to your genetic code.

18:31.028 --> 18:34.327
It will give you powers just like mine
for 24 hours...

18:34.665 --> 18:38.396
without my vulnerability to Kryptonite
or red sunlight.

18:39.236 --> 18:40.897
Happy birthday, Lois.

18:46.343 --> 18:48.038
Well?

18:48.378 --> 18:50.846
I feel different. Better.

18:51.014 --> 18:52.914
Is it working?

18:59.222 --> 19:02.123
Lex Luthor, your insane schemes
have endangered the lives...

19:02.292 --> 19:05.591
of every man, woman and child
on this planet.

19:06.797 --> 19:08.924
Before I deliver the
verdict of this court...

19:09.099 --> 19:11.795
do you have anything to say
in your defense?

19:11.968 --> 19:14.766
Superman made me do it.
He's the one that should be on trial.

19:14.938 --> 19:16.929
- What?
- Superman on trial?

19:19.176 --> 19:20.302
Order.

19:21.311 --> 19:24.940
Get this farce over with,
you pompous, senile toad.

19:25.716 --> 19:28.617
You're an amoral sociopathic predator...

19:28.785 --> 19:32.585
driven by jealousy,
greed and delusions of grandeur.

19:32.756 --> 19:34.383
Alexander Joseph Luthor...

19:34.758 --> 19:38.990
this court finds you guilty on all
counts of crimes against humanity.

19:39.162 --> 19:41.926
- Yes! Justice is served.
- It's about time.

20:01.618 --> 20:03.313
Does the costume I made for you fit?

20:03.720 --> 20:05.654
Only a little better than my own skin.

20:05.822 --> 20:07.983
Funny, I never noticed you
taking my measuremen...

20:09.359 --> 20:11.259
Ah! What's that noise?

20:11.561 --> 20:13.188
It's Jimmy's signal watch.

20:13.363 --> 20:16.059
And I can already see
why he's calling for help.

20:16.233 --> 20:17.359
Sorry, Lois.

20:17.534 --> 20:21.800
The last thing I wanted on your special day
was a reptile invasion from the Earth's core.

20:22.239 --> 20:24.537
I'd have felt cheated
if there weren't monsters.

20:24.941 --> 20:28.104
Come on, let's save Metropolis.

20:32.315 --> 20:33.873
I think we're a little late.

20:45.162 --> 20:49.565
Metropolis, Krull will eat your children.

20:54.871 --> 20:57.339
How about you eat this?

21:01.178 --> 21:04.147
Ha! Look who it is.

21:04.481 --> 21:05.539
Samson.

21:05.849 --> 21:08.841
Superman. Yo-ho.

21:18.962 --> 21:21.658
He won't be bothering Metropolis again
for a while.

21:21.832 --> 21:25.131
His lungs just burst. Excuse me.

21:28.438 --> 21:31.601
Always a joy to see you again.

21:33.543 --> 21:34.976
Why are you here, Samson?

21:35.145 --> 21:38.342
I thought you and your no-necked partner
were busy time-traveling.

21:43.587 --> 21:46.351
That we were, fair Lois.

21:46.523 --> 21:50.482
Only your loveliness could tempt me back
to this backward century.

21:50.660 --> 21:51.752
Atlas too.

21:56.399 --> 21:59.368
- Why are you here?
- They think this is a singles bar.

21:59.703 --> 22:02.194
Sorry, gentlemen, the lady's with me.

22:02.639 --> 22:05.164
That's the lady's decision, is it not?

22:05.342 --> 22:08.539
That's it.
I propose a challenge of the ages.

22:08.712 --> 22:12.079
We'll each perform a super-feat
in the lady's honor.

22:12.249 --> 22:16.345
Yes, and the most incredible feat
wins her.

22:16.519 --> 22:17.543
Wins me?

22:17.721 --> 22:20.884
Single girls with brains,
beauty and super-powers...

22:21.057 --> 22:23.457
are rare in any century, Lois.

22:23.627 --> 22:25.356
My super-feat is obvious.

22:25.528 --> 22:30.158
I defeated Krull in single combat,
foiling his war on Metropolis.

22:30.333 --> 22:32.927
And I subdued his entire army.

22:33.103 --> 22:36.766
There doesn't seem to be much left
for you to do, Superman.

22:37.140 --> 22:39.199
How about we get
these would-be conquerors...

22:39.376 --> 22:41.810
back to the center of the Earth
where they belong?

22:48.752 --> 22:52.381
The subterranosaur people
have ever feared...

22:52.555 --> 22:55.683
and respected you, Superman.

22:55.859 --> 22:59.659
My son will punished be for his crimes.

23:00.130 --> 23:05.090
But Krull speaks of him goaded be
into his attack...

23:05.268 --> 23:07.793
by man Samson.

23:08.238 --> 23:12.641
I suspected as much, Your Highness.
Please allow me to deal with it.

23:19.983 --> 23:21.245
Can you imagine?

23:21.418 --> 23:23.613
A race of dinosaur men
who escaped extinction...

23:23.787 --> 23:25.652
by moving to the center of the Earth.

23:25.822 --> 23:29.849
Come with me, and I'll show you wonders
far beyond what you've seen.

23:31.428 --> 23:33.362
A small token of my affection.

23:33.697 --> 23:37.531
The radioactive crown jewels
of the Ultrasphinx.

23:40.537 --> 23:41.799
Careful, Lois.

23:42.138 --> 23:43.969
Plutonium-240 is lethal.

23:44.140 --> 23:47.371
Not for the next 24 hours it isn't.

23:47.811 --> 23:49.108
Look, guys, I'm flattered.

23:49.279 --> 23:51.873
But you'd have to go a long way
to outdo Superman.

23:52.048 --> 23:56.212
You would spurn my affections
for a dalliance with this...?

23:56.386 --> 23:57.546
Careful.

23:57.887 --> 23:59.354
If I win your heart...

23:59.522 --> 24:03.686
I'll make the Titans kneel before you
and give testimony to your loveliness.

24:03.860 --> 24:08.820
I'll crush diamonds in my mighty fist
and make them into sparkling wine.

24:08.999 --> 24:10.489
Wow.

24:10.667 --> 24:12.760
That's day one.

24:14.771 --> 24:16.966
Lois, a moment, please?

24:18.408 --> 24:19.875
Why are you flirting with them?

24:20.210 --> 24:23.270
Maybe I'm teaching you a lesson
for impersonating Clark Kent.

24:23.446 --> 24:26.938
I'm not impersonating Clark Kent,
I am Clark Kent.

24:27.250 --> 24:29.946
Anyway, you can win any contest
those losers can dream up.

24:30.120 --> 24:33.021
Why don't you humor me?
It's my birthday.

24:38.428 --> 24:42.125
I don't like you much, Samson.
Trouble always seems to follow you.

24:42.298 --> 24:46.029
What do I have to do to make you
keep your hands off of my girl?

24:46.202 --> 24:51.538
I'm a time traveler, and I happen to know
she won't be your girl for much longer.

24:56.846 --> 24:59.212
All's fair in love and war.

24:59.616 --> 25:02.779
Anyway, pretty soon,
you'll be too busy with your challenge...

25:02.952 --> 25:04.886
to even think about dating.

25:05.055 --> 25:06.215
Forget it, Samson.

25:06.389 --> 25:10.416
Lois and I are going to a party in Atlantis
in less than an hour.

25:11.795 --> 25:13.490
I sincerely doubt it.

25:16.066 --> 25:18.626
What's this, Atlas,
part of my birthday surprise?

25:19.002 --> 25:23.302
Since we, uh, borrowed that necklace
from the Ultrasphinx...

25:23.473 --> 25:25.668
he's been hounding us
like one of the Furies.

25:25.842 --> 25:27.742
Chasing us throughout time and space.

25:28.411 --> 25:30.402
Legend has it
that just before your death...

25:30.580 --> 25:33.140
you performed the most amazing feats
of your career.

25:33.316 --> 25:37.514
Some scholars say that among them,
you answered the unanswerable question.

25:37.821 --> 25:40.119
What are you talking about?

25:41.057 --> 25:42.581
The Ultrasphinx is here.

25:45.328 --> 25:48.923
Return what was stolen.

25:49.299 --> 25:50.357
Lois.

25:53.636 --> 25:55.365
Halt.

25:55.905 --> 26:00.069
She exists now
in a condition of quantum uncertainty.

26:00.243 --> 26:02.643
Both alive and dead.

26:03.046 --> 26:07.210
The universe asks you
an unanswerable question.

26:07.383 --> 26:10.978
To answer correctly is life.

26:11.321 --> 26:15.121
Failure to answer correctly is death.

26:15.725 --> 26:18.523
This is my judgment.

26:20.196 --> 26:21.663
You stole that necklace.

26:21.831 --> 26:22.855
Don't you see?

26:23.032 --> 26:27.128
We couldn't fight the Ultrasphinx
without help, so we let it chase us here.

26:27.303 --> 26:30.670
But we meant no harm to Lois,
I swear to living Zeus.

26:31.007 --> 26:32.440
And I swear too.

26:32.609 --> 26:36.238
If she dies,
you're both going to the Phantom Zone.

26:36.880 --> 26:38.507
Ultrasphinx, let's hear it.

26:40.550 --> 26:46.511
What happens when the irresistible force
meets the immovable object?

27:10.780 --> 27:12.042
They surrender.

27:15.351 --> 27:18.286
Response acceptable.

27:24.327 --> 27:26.420
Superman.

27:28.164 --> 27:32.225
I was alive and dead at the same time.
My God.

27:32.402 --> 27:35.599
It's okay, I've got you.
Come on, we're going dancing.

27:35.772 --> 27:38.741
Wait a minute, what about our contest?

27:38.908 --> 27:42.469
Answering a riddle
is hardly what I'd call a feat of strength.

27:42.845 --> 27:46.076
I agree. How about I wrestle you for her?

27:46.249 --> 27:48.683
Or is the mighty Man of Steel a coward?

27:48.851 --> 27:51.820
Even the shield on his chest is yellow.

27:52.422 --> 27:55.289
Okay, that's enough, both of you.

28:02.765 --> 28:03.789
Then we have a deal?

28:04.167 --> 28:07.136
If I win, you both leave
the 21st century right now.

28:07.470 --> 28:13.375
I'll be leaving, all right,
with the beauteous Lois Lane on my arm.

28:13.543 --> 28:15.511
Not if I beat him first.

28:22.151 --> 28:24.619
I'm sorry, have you two already started?

28:43.906 --> 28:48.138
Today was perfect.
We did everything I ever wanted to do.

28:48.311 --> 28:50.609
You know
what I've always wanted to do?

28:50.780 --> 28:52.941
I mean, from the first day we met.

28:53.116 --> 28:54.674
What?

29:22.912 --> 29:25.244
My birthday gift's wearing off.

29:25.715 --> 29:28.240
I can't see radio waves anymore.

29:28.418 --> 29:30.352
I can't hear the stars singing.

29:30.520 --> 29:34.752
I'm tired and sore all over,
like I've been dancing all night.

29:34.924 --> 29:37.825
Thanks for letting me
spend a day in your world.

29:37.994 --> 29:39.859
You know, I do other things.

29:40.029 --> 29:42.259
I mean, besides being Superman.

29:43.299 --> 29:46.132
You do a great Clark Kent imitation.

29:46.302 --> 29:48.497
You almost had me fooled.

29:48.671 --> 29:52.334
Wait till I tell him about all this.

29:54.544 --> 29:56.205
Lois?

30:37.987 --> 30:40.979
I was aware
of your lumbering presence, Kent.

30:41.157 --> 30:45.355
Just finishing work on my Bibliobot,
a roving library.

30:45.528 --> 30:48.258
Read A Tale of Two Cities.

30:48.798 --> 30:51.062
It was the best of times, it was the...

30:51.234 --> 30:52.326
Call it off.

30:52.502 --> 30:56.131
- It was the age of wisdom...
- Watch your step, you clumsy ox.

30:57.807 --> 31:02.506
You write like a poet,
but you move like a landslide.

31:06.149 --> 31:09.550
I'm sure I had my dignity
when I came in here.

31:11.220 --> 31:14.121
Your clumsiness appears
to have saved me from electrocution.

31:14.290 --> 31:15.587
Albeit temporarily.

31:15.958 --> 31:18.188
Probably my rubber-soled shoes.

31:18.561 --> 31:21.052
I saw that "Da Vinci of Crime" headline.

31:21.230 --> 31:25.132
It seems like a compliment,
but there's a sneer behind it.

31:25.601 --> 31:29.401
Reporters don't write the headlines
to their stories, Lex.

31:30.773 --> 31:32.035
Hmm.

31:36.279 --> 31:38.304
You coming, Kent?

31:43.753 --> 31:44.947
He sickens me.

31:45.121 --> 31:48.648
That insipid boyish grin,
the smug self-regard.

31:49.192 --> 31:52.992
Tell the truth.
Doesn't his very existence diminish you?

31:53.162 --> 31:54.493
Diminish us all?

31:55.364 --> 31:57.127
Our jobs don't really overlap.

31:57.300 --> 32:00.497
What are you writing about me?
Give me that.

32:03.372 --> 32:06.170
Code? I'll decipher it
in less than a minute.

32:06.342 --> 32:09.072
- I...
- It's shorthand, Lex.

32:09.245 --> 32:12.976
What kind of ridiculous affectation
is that for a man?

32:14.517 --> 32:16.712
Can you imagine a better world, Kent?

32:18.688 --> 32:20.815
That's all I've ever asked.

32:20.990 --> 32:24.824
In a world without Superman,
the unattainable Lois Lane...

32:24.994 --> 32:28.987
might have noticed good old Clark,
pining away in the corner.

32:29.398 --> 32:32.390
You keep talking about me,
but I'm here to interview you.

32:32.702 --> 32:33.760
I'm just saying.

32:33.936 --> 32:39.465
A strapping farm boy with brains,
integrity, no discernible style of his own?

32:39.642 --> 32:42.509
You're a prize catch
for a cynical city girl.

32:43.679 --> 32:45.306
Why haven't you filed an appeal?

32:45.481 --> 32:48.348
But with him around,
you're a parody of a man.

32:48.751 --> 32:50.946
A dullard, a cripple.

32:53.256 --> 32:56.555
Next to Superman, even Lex Luthor's
greatness is overshadowed.

33:00.730 --> 33:02.357
Are you trying to intimidate me?

33:02.698 --> 33:04.563
I'm trying to educate you.

33:04.734 --> 33:08.431
We all fall short
of his sickening inhuman perfection.

33:09.338 --> 33:10.532
Feel that, Kent.

33:10.706 --> 33:13.937
Real muscle.
Not the gift of alien biochemistry.

33:14.110 --> 33:15.805
The product of hard work.

33:16.312 --> 33:19.076
You don't really act like a man
facing the end of his life.

33:19.749 --> 33:21.239
No, I don't.

33:21.417 --> 33:23.442
So how's Superman these days?

33:24.086 --> 33:26.247
Pale? Tired?

33:26.422 --> 33:28.947
- Weak?
- He seems fine.

33:29.926 --> 33:32.724
Ah. But he's not.

33:41.804 --> 33:44.295
What would you do
if you had his powers?

33:44.674 --> 33:47.734
- Help people.
- You probably would.

33:48.044 --> 33:50.911
You lack the imagination
to see the alternatives.

33:56.452 --> 33:57.476
Alternatives?

33:57.653 --> 34:02.317
To truth, justice and all the other things
you can't weigh or measure.

34:02.959 --> 34:05.894
To every abstract notion he personifies.

34:06.062 --> 34:08.656
I'll kill you, Luthor.

34:08.831 --> 34:11.629
Suck you dry.

34:11.801 --> 34:13.792
Kill you.

34:14.136 --> 34:15.797
You don't scare me, Parasite.

34:15.972 --> 34:18.873
Brain beats brawn every time.

34:19.041 --> 34:20.507
That glass isn't leaded.

34:24.380 --> 34:25.574
Power.

34:25.748 --> 34:28.308
More power than I ever had.

34:30.085 --> 34:31.781
Look out.

35:07.623 --> 35:08.817
What the...?

35:12.094 --> 35:14.426
Find the power.

35:30.346 --> 35:31.813
Fire.

35:43.993 --> 35:45.688
Get them.

35:51.233 --> 35:53.292
Gotta get away from him.

35:54.503 --> 35:58.405
What's the matter, Kent?
Afraid he'll absorb your cowardice?

35:59.108 --> 36:00.735
- Come on!
- Get them!

36:00.910 --> 36:02.741
Let's go!

36:09.218 --> 36:11.243
Incoming!

36:11.687 --> 36:13.917
Find the power.

36:20.096 --> 36:22.223
That's tear gas, you idiot.

37:01.537 --> 37:03.505
There you are.

37:03.773 --> 37:06.708
If you wanna survive this, stay with me.

37:07.743 --> 37:10.576
- Get them.
- Run.

37:22.057 --> 37:24.321
- Yeah, let's go.
- Come on.

37:42.144 --> 37:46.342
I should have left you to those animals,
Kent, but I need you alive.

37:49.051 --> 37:50.814
I need you to tell my story.

37:50.986 --> 37:55.650
The story of a man who refused
to bend his knee to the alien invader.

37:56.025 --> 37:58.357
Look out, he's coming right at us.

37:59.628 --> 38:02.529
Power, like the sun.

38:04.066 --> 38:08.093
That won't stop him, he's absorbing
the kinetic energy of the bullets.

38:12.441 --> 38:15.001
Pray to Einstein for a miracle, Kent.

38:24.220 --> 38:25.585
Earthquake.

38:37.933 --> 38:39.400
Attack me?

38:39.568 --> 38:42.401
You know what happens
when you take on Lex Luthor?

38:52.348 --> 38:54.816
The same thing that's gonna happen
to Superman.

39:00.623 --> 39:02.113
I've always liked you, Kent.

39:02.825 --> 39:06.784
You're humble, modest,
comically uncoordinated.

39:06.962 --> 39:08.088
Human.

39:08.264 --> 39:11.233
In short, you're everything he's not.

39:17.339 --> 39:20.274
I'm going to give you a present.

39:25.281 --> 39:28.773
Did you know that Moby-Dick
can be recited at a frequency so high...

39:28.951 --> 39:32.580
that it becomes a sonic drill
capable of carving through solid rock?

39:33.322 --> 39:34.516
Call me Ishmael.

39:34.690 --> 39:37.318
Some years
ago, never mind how long precisely....

39:38.994 --> 39:40.461
Stop.

39:52.007 --> 39:53.872
You can escape any time you want.

39:54.043 --> 39:55.067
I don't want.

39:55.244 --> 39:59.442
I'm going to the chair fulfilled,
knowing that I killed Superman.

39:59.615 --> 40:01.082
Poisoned him with an overdose...

40:01.250 --> 40:04.151
of the same solar rays
that give him his powers.

40:04.320 --> 40:05.719
You can't prove any of this.

40:05.888 --> 40:07.412
It's the truth, Kent.

40:07.589 --> 40:09.079
My gift to you.

40:09.258 --> 40:11.852
He doesn't want the world
to know he's dying, of course.

40:12.027 --> 40:13.289
So break the news gently.

40:13.462 --> 40:17.228
A tasteful 140-point headline
should suffice.

40:24.773 --> 40:26.365
This is as far as I go.

40:26.542 --> 40:30.444
My lovely niece, Nasthalthia,
will take you the rest of the way.

40:30.612 --> 40:31.670
Mr. Kent.

40:31.847 --> 40:36.910
She's 18, speaks 30 languages
and aspires to someday rule the world.

40:38.854 --> 40:41.652
I may let her, after I'm done with it.

40:42.358 --> 40:45.725
It's such a waste. You and Superman
could have been friends...

40:45.894 --> 40:47.555
and instead you're going to die.

40:47.730 --> 40:49.960
Ah, but he'll die first.

41:04.580 --> 41:07.276
Where to now, Mr. Kent?

41:07.850 --> 41:09.909
Deep space.

41:11.020 --> 41:12.317
Why?

41:12.488 --> 41:13.716
Do you know what this is?

41:13.889 --> 41:15.823
It's the bottle city of Kandor.

41:15.991 --> 41:18.858
One of your enemies stole it
from Krypton, before it exploded.

41:19.028 --> 41:22.589
Brainiac. He used his technology
to miniaturize the greatest city...

41:22.765 --> 41:23.959
of my home world.

41:24.133 --> 41:27.364
I've been trying to restore
the thousands of people who live there...

41:27.536 --> 41:28.867
to regular size.

41:29.038 --> 41:30.972
You've found a way.

41:31.140 --> 41:32.539
No.

41:32.708 --> 41:35.268
But I have found a suitable planet
for them to colonize.

41:35.444 --> 41:36.775
And I'm taking them there.

41:37.946 --> 41:40.813
The thing is, it's very far away.

41:40.983 --> 41:42.575
Even under normal circumstances...

41:42.751 --> 41:45.515
it would take me three weeks
to fly there and back.

41:45.687 --> 41:50.021
In my current condition,
it'll take longer than that.

41:50.192 --> 41:52.285
Maybe longer than I have.

41:52.795 --> 41:54.228
I don't understand.

41:54.830 --> 41:57.560
It's what I've been keeping from you.

41:59.168 --> 42:01.568
I'm dying, Lois.

42:10.179 --> 42:13.080
You won't die.
You'll find a way out of this.

42:13.482 --> 42:16.576
We'll be together. Our children
will go flying in Metropolis Park.

42:16.752 --> 42:17.776
Promise me.

42:18.320 --> 42:23.519
We can't have children.
Our biology is too different.

42:24.693 --> 42:27.685
Whatever happens,
we'll never have more than this.

42:27.863 --> 42:29.592
What do you always say?

42:29.765 --> 42:31.665
"There's always a way."

42:31.834 --> 42:33.096
I'm sorry, Lois.

42:33.268 --> 42:36.669
The work doesn't stop
just because I'm dying.

42:41.343 --> 42:43.334
Take your people to their new home.

42:43.512 --> 42:46.606
When you get back,
I'll be right here waiting.

43:24.653 --> 43:26.746
Look, up in the sky.

43:53.248 --> 43:55.716
Sorry if I startled you.

43:56.718 --> 44:00.745
It's been a long trip
and I'm feeling a bit under the weather.

44:18.207 --> 44:19.731
What happened to Metropolis?

44:24.246 --> 44:25.907
Great Caesar's ghost.

44:26.081 --> 44:28.948
Kent, where have you been
for the last two months?

44:29.117 --> 44:30.243
I went to your funeral.

44:30.719 --> 44:34.416
I was accidentally buried underneath
Stryker's Island during the prison riot.

44:34.856 --> 44:37.791
Lucky for me, there was
a fully stocked bomb shelter down there.

44:37.960 --> 44:41.487
To make a long story short,
Superman heard me calling for help...

44:41.830 --> 44:44.765
Superman's alive? I knew it.

44:45.934 --> 44:46.958
Has he seen this?

44:57.246 --> 44:58.679
Refreshing.

44:58.847 --> 45:00.109
And beautiful.

45:00.282 --> 45:02.842
A fitting spot for the capital
of new Krypton.

45:03.418 --> 45:06.478
I think we could just as easily
clear the apes out of Metropolis...

45:06.655 --> 45:08.122
and build there.

45:08.590 --> 45:11.286
If you prefer, my love.

45:11.860 --> 45:13.760
Hello there.

45:14.363 --> 45:16.831
- Did you hear something?
- The wind?

45:16.999 --> 45:19.524
Bar-El and Lilo. I just read all about you.

45:19.935 --> 45:23.063
Astronauts from Krypton
who were lost in space for decades.

45:23.238 --> 45:26.036
It's an honor to meet you,
I'm from Krypton too.

45:26.208 --> 45:29.109
We know who you are, Superman.

45:29.278 --> 45:31.576
We found Earth
by tracking the warp signature...

45:31.747 --> 45:33.578
of the vessel that brought you here.

45:33.749 --> 45:36.081
I don't know why you bothered to return.

45:36.251 --> 45:38.310
This planet's my home, I was raised here.

45:38.487 --> 45:40.216
But my Kryptonian name is Kal-El.

45:40.389 --> 45:42.482
I'm the son of Jor-El.
We're probably related.

45:43.158 --> 45:46.321
I remember Jor-El. A weak man.

45:46.495 --> 45:48.690
An ineffectual dreamer.

45:48.864 --> 45:51.526
The son follows the father.

45:52.301 --> 45:54.895
You could have built a new Krypton
in this squalor.

45:55.437 --> 45:58.998
I don't have any right
to impose my will over...

46:09.751 --> 46:11.582
You just moved into my fortress?

46:12.054 --> 46:14.022
Shouldn't have left the key lying around.

46:15.190 --> 46:16.384
We had every right.

46:16.792 --> 46:19.420
The powers that we gain
from this world's yellow sun.

46:19.594 --> 46:22.859
The superiority
of our Kryptonian culture.

46:23.332 --> 46:28.497
You were remiss not taking similar
liberties with the rest of the planet.

46:33.809 --> 46:36.369
You tore down the statue of my parents.

46:36.745 --> 46:40.181
We celebrate the life of Krypton,
not her death.

46:40.349 --> 46:43.045
This whole place reeks of morbidity.

46:49.725 --> 46:53.627
Even Krypton's criminally insane,
forever trapped in the Phantom Zone...

46:53.795 --> 46:57.458
evidence more nobility
than the best of the human apes.

46:57.632 --> 46:59.293
You should be ashamed.

47:00.335 --> 47:03.202
I was thinking maybe
you could replace me after I'm gone...

47:04.072 --> 47:07.769
but you don't have the best interests
of this planet's people at heart.

47:07.943 --> 47:11.003
And this is you
puffing up your chest at me, is it?

47:11.179 --> 47:12.737
You've gone native.

47:12.914 --> 47:14.404
It's disgusting.

47:58.627 --> 48:01.152
You've broken the moon.

48:04.299 --> 48:06.494
I think you looked better in the dress.

48:06.668 --> 48:09.330
I didn't realize Kryptonian fashion
was so popular.

48:09.805 --> 48:13.764
Kryptonian everything.
It's a new world, Mr. Kent.

48:20.649 --> 48:24.517
I know you're behind me, Steve.
So whatever you're doing, just sto... Ah!

48:26.521 --> 48:29.820
I missed you, Kent. You're comedy gold.

48:32.594 --> 48:33.822
Your hairpiece is on fire.

48:34.362 --> 48:37.195
I don't wear a... Ah!

48:39.267 --> 48:41.167
That's gotta be a little embarrassing.

48:41.336 --> 48:44.203
So this is where Superman hides.

48:44.372 --> 48:46.135
It's worse than I'd thought.

48:46.308 --> 48:48.367
You choose to disguise your greatness...

48:48.543 --> 48:51.808
and cavort with the apes
as one of their own.

48:51.980 --> 48:53.538
Have you no dignity?

48:54.149 --> 48:56.811
I'm loaded with dignity.

48:57.252 --> 48:59.083
I can see how you'd make the mistake...

48:59.254 --> 49:02.621
but, despite this great bod,
I'm not Superman.

49:02.791 --> 49:04.520
Call Superman with your signal watch.

49:04.726 --> 49:07.217
- Where are you going?
- Nosebleed.

49:07.729 --> 49:08.753
Enough.

49:08.930 --> 49:11.364
This degrading impersonation will cease.

49:11.533 --> 49:14.627
- Reveal your Kryptonian colors or...
- Bar-El.

49:14.803 --> 49:17.704
I feel so... Uh.

49:17.873 --> 49:18.897
No.

49:25.814 --> 49:27.406
I've got her.

49:30.051 --> 49:33.452
Take your naked hands away from her.

49:34.389 --> 49:35.856
I can't fly.

49:36.024 --> 49:38.515
I'm so weak. Why do I feel so weak?

49:39.194 --> 49:42.391
You said you retraced the path
my ship took to get to Earth.

49:42.564 --> 49:45.226
That means you passed through
Krypton's debris field.

49:45.400 --> 49:48.858
The minerals in your bodies
have been slowly turning to Kryptonite.

49:49.037 --> 49:52.302
I don't need help. Not from you.

49:55.911 --> 49:57.139
Bar-El.

49:59.748 --> 50:01.807
I can't see.

50:05.954 --> 50:08.081
I've done what I can
to make her comfortable.

50:08.590 --> 50:11.525
But I can't neutralize
the Kryptonite in your bodies.

50:11.693 --> 50:13.217
Not in time.

50:13.395 --> 50:17.422
After everything we've done,
you still show us kindness.

50:18.033 --> 50:20.729
My Earth parents taught me forgiveness.

50:20.902 --> 50:23.393
Humanity has a lot to teach us.

50:23.872 --> 50:25.237
Perhaps.

50:25.407 --> 50:30.401
Kal-El, son of Krypton,
I'm proud to call you my kin.

50:31.279 --> 50:33.873
Our greatness lives on in you.

50:34.816 --> 50:36.147
We don't have much time.

50:39.020 --> 50:41.181
There's a way to save us both.

50:41.356 --> 50:42.983
Surely you've thought of it.

50:43.825 --> 50:45.417
Yes.

50:45.594 --> 50:47.152
But it has to be your choice.

50:48.129 --> 50:49.756
I'll try to find a way to cure you.

50:50.332 --> 50:52.926
But your own time is short.

50:53.635 --> 50:55.603
Do what you must.

51:02.110 --> 51:05.045
Send us to the Phantom Zone.

51:31.039 --> 51:32.939
Forgiveness.

51:39.481 --> 51:41.244
You win, Luthor.

51:41.850 --> 51:43.408
I'm dying.

51:43.585 --> 51:44.847
The world is yours...

51:45.020 --> 51:48.285
at least for the three weeks
you have left before they execute you.

51:48.456 --> 51:50.321
So here's a challenge.

51:50.492 --> 51:53.689
All the things you said you would have
done to benefit humanity...

51:53.862 --> 51:55.329
if I hadn't been in your way?

51:55.497 --> 51:56.930
Now's the time to prove it.

51:57.966 --> 52:01.197
Lex, I know there's good in you.

52:14.182 --> 52:16.173
You showed me everything
I needed to know...

52:16.351 --> 52:18.285
so I could go on without you.

52:18.753 --> 52:21.347
I just hope I've shown them the same.

52:27.896 --> 52:29.329
Clark?

52:32.767 --> 52:36.100
You weren't going to sneak in and out
without visiting your mother?

52:36.271 --> 52:39.638
Of course not.
I just wanted to leave a flower.

52:39.808 --> 52:42.902
It's Kryptonian, it'll never wither.

52:43.078 --> 52:45.876
You look thin. Are you sick?

52:46.481 --> 52:48.608
Ma, I'm Superman.

52:49.250 --> 52:50.547
And I'm your mother.

52:51.152 --> 52:53.086
You take better care of yourself.

52:53.254 --> 52:55.017
Yes, ma'am.

52:58.793 --> 53:01.057
- Do you miss him?
- Every day.

53:02.030 --> 53:04.863
But his spirit is always with us.

53:05.567 --> 53:09.264
So you have time to eat,
or do you have to go save the world?

53:15.877 --> 53:17.174
I love you, Ma.

53:17.679 --> 53:19.943
I love you too, son.

53:33.628 --> 53:35.960
Ah.

53:41.970 --> 53:43.369
Through this holy anointing...

53:43.538 --> 53:45.870
may the Lord,
in his love and mercy, help you...

53:46.040 --> 53:50.170
Get away from me, Padre.
You stink of the irrational.

53:50.945 --> 53:52.310
Typical.

53:52.480 --> 53:54.471
Superman doesn't even bother to show.

53:55.049 --> 53:57.415
I'd planned for him to be here
to see this.

53:57.585 --> 54:00.145
I'm sure he'll hear all about it.

54:24.245 --> 54:28.306
You knuckle-dragging morons.
It was almost too easy.

54:28.483 --> 54:29.541
My last request?

54:29.717 --> 54:33.881
That cocktail was
a 24-hour super-power serum.

54:47.035 --> 54:48.696
My turn.

54:53.942 --> 54:57.139
I'd be pleased to clean
the Sun-Eater's pen for you, Superman.

54:57.312 --> 54:59.576
Just my way of saying goodbye
to the little fella.

54:59.747 --> 55:02.807
He might be one of the most
dangerous creatures in the universe...

55:02.984 --> 55:05.077
but I'm still going to, mm...

55:05.253 --> 55:08.154
- miss him.
- Are you all right?

55:14.162 --> 55:17.131
Superman's journal, final entry.

55:17.532 --> 55:21.400
My cells are breaking down
at an alarming rate.

55:21.569 --> 55:23.628
I'm running out of time.

55:24.939 --> 55:27.965
I have few regrets.
My life has been a wonder.

55:28.877 --> 55:34.076
I've traveled across space and time,
seen and done things beyond imagination.

55:34.249 --> 55:39.209
I had parents who loved me,
good friends like Pete, Lana and Jimmy.

55:39.387 --> 55:42.413
I got to help people,
while living an incredible adventure.

55:43.091 --> 55:45.059
I loved a good woman.

55:45.426 --> 55:47.087
And she loved me back.

55:48.663 --> 55:50.460
I'm tired.

55:51.165 --> 55:53.827
But I still have one more job to do.

56:02.543 --> 56:03.669
That was uncalled-for.

56:04.178 --> 56:05.304
Couldn't resist.

56:05.480 --> 56:10.349
I've got his super-powers for 24 hours,
courtesy of a serum he created.

56:10.885 --> 56:14.753
- How?
- His fortress is less than entirely secure.

56:15.223 --> 56:17.691
Cool. When do I get my super-powers?

56:17.859 --> 56:20.259
The same day that I can trust you
with the car keys.

56:20.428 --> 56:23.693
On your feet.
I've set the scum on Stryker's free.

56:23.865 --> 56:26.766
They'll keep the police busy
with their rioting.

56:34.776 --> 56:35.834
And so will you.

56:36.711 --> 56:39.111
Remote control for my terror weapons.

56:39.781 --> 56:41.078
Have fun.

56:41.249 --> 56:44.116
If you have all his powers,
why bother with all this?

56:45.620 --> 56:48.384
You wouldn't ask
if you'd ever seen him in a fight.

56:48.556 --> 56:50.581
And I have fought him plenty.

56:50.758 --> 56:54.159
That's why I've made arrangements
for a little extra insurance.

56:55.830 --> 57:00.927
Unlike me, Superman loses his powers
under red sunlight, right?

57:03.137 --> 57:05.503
Friends in high places.

57:06.407 --> 57:08.398
Where is Superman?

57:08.576 --> 57:10.840
Do you fear the tyrant sun?

57:11.579 --> 57:15.345
Face the scourge of worlds.

57:17.752 --> 57:20.915
Luthor's secret ally
has finally revealed himself.

57:21.356 --> 57:24.587
My last adventure is about to begin.

57:24.759 --> 57:27.353
This is Superman, signing out.

57:31.966 --> 57:34.434
You will not stand alone.

57:34.602 --> 57:38.561
One of us will remain behind,
to maintain your fortress for posterity.

57:38.740 --> 57:41.675
The rest of us will fight by your side.

57:42.477 --> 57:44.502
I couldn't ask for greater loyalty.

57:45.313 --> 57:47.941
Solaris is a living solar computer.

57:48.116 --> 57:52.212
He poisons healthy stars, making them emit
blue light that he can metabolize.

57:52.387 --> 57:57.086
Set your receivers to 430 terahertz,
and you'll be able to hear him.

58:03.498 --> 58:07.161
Impossible, I made your sun red.

58:07.335 --> 58:10.327
You should have no powers.

58:11.606 --> 58:12.800
I see now.

58:12.974 --> 58:15.943
Your covering protects you
from red sunlight.

58:16.110 --> 58:19.910
But it cannot long survive this heat.

58:21.049 --> 58:23.711
It should work long enough
for me to take care of you.

58:23.885 --> 58:26.911
No, your sun is dying...

58:27.088 --> 58:30.421
but I kill you first.

58:31.159 --> 58:32.626
Stop this.

58:32.794 --> 58:35.888
Whatever Luthor offered you,
he'll betray you.

58:37.965 --> 58:41.799
I betray Luthor first.

58:46.641 --> 58:50.771
I will eat your sun,
and replace it in the sky.

58:51.946 --> 58:57.350
Your people will pray to me,
or die in the cold dark.

59:07.528 --> 59:10.292
- Save yourselves.
- No.

59:10.465 --> 59:13.957
Solaris overrode Robot 7's program.

59:14.135 --> 59:17.627
Robot 7 stole super-serum for Luthor.

59:19.674 --> 59:21.801
Robot 7 must atone.

59:31.085 --> 59:33.246
Forgive me.

59:44.565 --> 59:46.089
What is this?!

59:46.701 --> 59:49.534
The natural enemy of a rogue sun.

59:51.038 --> 59:52.835
Meet my pet Sun-Eater.

59:53.674 --> 59:58.077
Abomination! Ohhh!

01:00:01.082 --> 01:00:02.208
Give up, Solaris.

01:00:02.383 --> 01:00:04.180
You can't beat him, there's no need...

01:00:09.891 --> 01:00:11.381
You killed him.

01:00:25.606 --> 01:00:26.937
The sky's normal again.

01:00:27.909 --> 01:00:30.343
Superman must have...

01:00:32.547 --> 01:00:35.015
Get out of the car, Miss Lane.
Everybody, now.

01:00:47.328 --> 01:00:50.695
Jimmy Olsen and Lois Lane, right?

01:00:51.566 --> 01:00:54.228
You two are so postmortem.

01:01:07.215 --> 01:01:09.240
Mercy.

01:01:12.119 --> 01:01:14.815
I don't think I have any left.

01:01:28.836 --> 01:01:31.930
Give me one good reason
I shouldn't vaporize you.

01:01:33.241 --> 01:01:37.268
The front-page story we're gonna write
about you for tomorrow's Daily Planet?

01:01:38.312 --> 01:01:39.973
Hmm.

01:01:42.683 --> 01:01:45.777
Kent, what's the matter with you?
You look like hell.

01:01:48.556 --> 01:01:50.615
I saw the whole thing, Perry.

01:01:50.992 --> 01:01:52.983
I've got tomorrow's big story.

01:01:58.966 --> 01:02:01.332
Just finished it.

01:02:03.204 --> 01:02:04.933
Clark.

01:02:08.376 --> 01:02:10.844
- He's not breathing.
- No.

01:02:11.445 --> 01:02:13.936
He doesn't have a heartbeat, Lois.

01:02:19.253 --> 01:02:20.447
Look at that.

01:02:27.395 --> 01:02:29.625
He's the least of your worries.

01:02:29.797 --> 01:02:32.288
You get the hell out of here, Luthor!

01:02:32.466 --> 01:02:35.401
That's no way to talk
to the future savior of the Earth.

01:02:35.569 --> 01:02:38.800
Who, by the way,
you sent to the electric chair.

01:02:38.973 --> 01:02:40.736
The truth sent you to the chair.

01:02:40.908 --> 01:02:42.398
I don't believe in truth.

01:02:42.576 --> 01:02:45.272
You can't measure it
or hold it in your hands.

01:02:45.446 --> 01:02:48.574
I mean, what is truth?

01:02:48.749 --> 01:02:51.377
Lex, stop it.
I know what the power's like.

01:02:51.552 --> 01:02:54.214
It's intoxicating, but there's more to it.

01:02:54.388 --> 01:02:55.980
Use those super-senses.

01:02:56.157 --> 01:02:57.920
Just think for a minute.

01:02:58.893 --> 01:03:01.521
You can stop trying to stall me.

01:03:02.530 --> 01:03:03.554
Ah!

01:03:03.731 --> 01:03:06.666
And you won't be needing
that infuriating signal watch any longer.

01:03:06.834 --> 01:03:09.166
Superman won't be coming
to the rescue.

01:03:09.337 --> 01:03:11.498
Too bad, because without him,
we're screwed.

01:03:11.906 --> 01:03:16.400
Look at these pictures from our
Singapore desk, the sun is turning blue.

01:03:19.347 --> 01:03:22.407
Don't you get it? Solaris double-crossed
you and poisoned the sun.

01:03:22.583 --> 01:03:24.608
You vain, stupid little man.

01:03:24.785 --> 01:03:26.582
Stupid?

01:03:31.425 --> 01:03:33.052
Lois.

01:03:34.595 --> 01:03:38.292
Anyone else feel like acting out
against the most powerful man on Earth?

01:03:38.466 --> 01:03:40.093
I do.

01:03:43.838 --> 01:03:45.965
What are you trying to hide from me?

01:03:46.140 --> 01:03:47.732
Gravity gun.

01:04:04.191 --> 01:04:05.852
Clark?

01:04:06.527 --> 01:04:07.755
I told you, Lois.

01:04:10.598 --> 01:04:12.395
Superman.

01:04:25.479 --> 01:04:28.107
Did you ever think
that it would end like this?

01:04:28.649 --> 01:04:30.617
Me looking down on you?

01:04:30.785 --> 01:04:34.812
Actually, I had the whole thing figured
to end pretty much exactly like this.

01:04:34.989 --> 01:04:38.186
I've been on to you
since Robot 7 first malfunctioned.

01:04:43.597 --> 01:04:44.962
Hard to stay in the air?

01:04:45.132 --> 01:04:48.295
I just increased
your personal gravity 500 times.

01:04:48.702 --> 01:04:51.262
That's not why I used the gravity gun, I...

01:04:51.439 --> 01:04:53.031
No.

01:05:02.650 --> 01:05:05.050
If I die, you die first.

01:06:12.653 --> 01:06:13.779
Look.

01:06:22.863 --> 01:06:25.263
Welcome to the new world.

01:06:31.539 --> 01:06:33.598
Lay down your weapons
and you won't be hurt.

01:06:33.774 --> 01:06:35.969
I'll be moving into the White House
later today.

01:06:36.143 --> 01:06:39.203
I'll make my formal declaration then.

01:06:40.614 --> 01:06:41.672
Ooh.

01:06:41.849 --> 01:06:45.307
Can we have a show trial
before we put these traitors to death?

01:06:50.991 --> 01:06:53.619
- Are you okay?
- Better than okay.

01:06:54.495 --> 01:06:58.261
I can see
the entire electromagnetic spectrum...

01:06:58.432 --> 01:07:04.098
and those must be atoms,
little clouds of possibility.

01:07:04.939 --> 01:07:08.431
Einstein couldn't connect the
gravitational force to the other three...

01:07:08.609 --> 01:07:10.577
but if he could have seen this....

01:07:11.579 --> 01:07:13.444
It's so obvious.

01:07:13.614 --> 01:07:15.081
Uncle Lex?

01:07:15.249 --> 01:07:17.979
The fundamental forces
are yoked by consciousness.

01:07:18.152 --> 01:07:20.245
Everything's connected.

01:07:20.421 --> 01:07:22.912
Everyone.

01:07:23.157 --> 01:07:26.854
And this is how he sees things
all the time.

01:07:27.027 --> 01:07:28.619
Every day.

01:07:28.796 --> 01:07:31.856
I don't know
if I should be worried or mortified.

01:07:32.333 --> 01:07:34.233
It's a cruel joke.

01:07:34.401 --> 01:07:36.494
The mechanistic clockwork of reality...

01:07:36.670 --> 01:07:42.108
hinging on a precious
impossible defiance of entropy, on life.

01:07:42.276 --> 01:07:43.937
And the clockwork doesn't care.

01:07:44.111 --> 01:07:48.673
It's like... Like it's all just us,
in here together.

01:07:49.650 --> 01:07:51.174
We're all we've got.

01:07:51.919 --> 01:07:54.114
You are embarrassing me
beyond therapy.

01:07:54.288 --> 01:07:56.552
You'll have to forgive him, Nasthalthia.

01:07:57.157 --> 01:07:59.489
He just figured out
how everything works.

01:08:00.361 --> 01:08:02.625
Gravity warps time.

01:08:02.796 --> 01:08:05.663
Superman trapped me
in a relativistic conundrum.

01:08:06.100 --> 01:08:12.164
He's trying to say his 24 hours
of super-powers just ran out.

01:08:12.339 --> 01:08:14.273
But it's only been a couple of hours.

01:08:14.441 --> 01:08:15.874
Relative to us.

01:08:16.042 --> 01:08:18.636
The gravity gun sped up his clock a little.

01:08:18.812 --> 01:08:21.406
You think I didn't make more of the...?

01:08:21.582 --> 01:08:23.812
Looking for this?

01:08:24.852 --> 01:08:27.377
Give it back. I saw everything.

01:08:27.554 --> 01:08:29.317
I saw how to save the world.

01:08:34.962 --> 01:08:36.725
I could have made everyone see.

01:08:37.898 --> 01:08:41.459
If it wasn't for you,
I could have saved the world.

01:08:42.403 --> 01:08:44.428
If it had mattered to you, Luthor...

01:08:45.205 --> 01:08:47.435
you could have saved the world
years ago.

01:08:49.576 --> 01:08:50.872
You're right.

01:08:58.551 --> 01:09:00.952
Oh, your poor face.

01:09:02.589 --> 01:09:05.113
No one can repair the sun but me, Lois.

01:09:05.759 --> 01:09:08.421
I'm turning into pure energy...

01:09:11.832 --> 01:09:15.563
and I only have one chance
to save the world.

01:09:16.569 --> 01:09:18.629
That's all you've ever needed.

01:09:20.107 --> 01:09:22.075
I love you, Lois Lane...

01:09:22.943 --> 01:09:25.036
until the end of time.

01:10:54.401 --> 01:10:57.097
Are you sure you don't wanna speak
at the memorial service?

01:10:57.271 --> 01:10:59.967
Thousands of people are there
paying their respects.

01:11:00.140 --> 01:11:01.607
He's not dead.

01:11:01.775 --> 01:11:03.800
He's up there fixing the sun.

01:11:03.977 --> 01:11:06.571
And when he's done, he'll be back.

01:11:07.514 --> 01:11:10.074
And I'll be here waiting for him.

01:11:18.425 --> 01:11:20.290
Doomed planet.

01:11:20.460 --> 01:11:22.758
Desperate scientists.

01:11:22.930 --> 01:11:24.557
Last hope.

01:11:24.731 --> 01:11:26.699
Kindly couple.

01:11:26.867 --> 01:11:28.095
Superman.

01:11:28.735 --> 01:11:30.635
We all know the story, Luthor.

01:11:30.804 --> 01:11:32.533
Why did you ask to see me?

01:11:33.040 --> 01:11:34.507
If this is an escape attempt...

01:11:34.675 --> 01:11:36.609
I'd already be free.

01:11:36.777 --> 01:11:40.508
No, I've already accepted
my imminent execution.

01:11:41.215 --> 01:11:43.513
This is a confession.

01:11:43.684 --> 01:11:47.085
Forgive me, doctor, for I have sinned.

01:11:48.188 --> 01:11:49.678
A lot.

01:11:50.991 --> 01:11:52.515
You killed him.

01:11:52.693 --> 01:11:57.756
And my deathbed claims that I've seen
the error of my ways can't change that.

01:11:57.931 --> 01:12:01.196
But there is one thing that I can do
to honor his memory.

01:12:11.945 --> 01:12:17.645
"A-A-C-C-A-T-T-A"....

01:12:18.352 --> 01:12:22.584
- Is that...?
- A map of Superman's genetic code.

01:12:23.223 --> 01:12:26.454
I reverse-engineered it
from his 24-hour super-serum.

01:12:26.627 --> 01:12:29.755
I also finally figured out
how to replicate it.

01:12:29.930 --> 01:12:31.261
No.

01:12:31.431 --> 01:12:35.765
Of course, it will require an ovum
from a healthy human woman.

01:13:00.727 --> 01:13:03.628
They always said they wanted children.

01:13:10.871 --> 01:13:12.964
He's not dead.

01:13:13.307 --> 01:13:16.003
He's up there fixing the sun.

01:13:17.044 --> 01:13:20.036
And when he's done, he'll be back.
