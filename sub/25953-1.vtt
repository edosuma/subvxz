WEBVTT

00:25.251 --> 00:30.751
Homo!
Are you a boy or a girl?

00:32.209 --> 00:34.292
Get a haircut!

00:36.334 --> 00:38.001
<i>You know the feeling</i> -

00:38.084 --> 00:41.042
<i>when you don't come up
with anything smart to say?</i>

00:45.001 --> 00:47.417
Weirdo homo.
- Yeah!

00:47.876 --> 00:49.834
<i>It happens to me a lot.</i>

00:55.209 --> 00:58.584
<i>"Dickheads."
That's what I should've said.</i>

01:24.917 --> 01:29.001
LOTVONEN SLAUGHTERHOUSE

01:36.417 --> 01:39.001
<i>I'm a metalhead.
And we have a band.</i>

02:01.251 --> 02:02.876
<i>That's Lotvonen.</i>

02:03.042 --> 02:05.334
<i>He's insanely fast.
As a guitar player.</i>

02:05.459 --> 02:08.292
<i>His parents own
this reindeer slaughterhouse.</i>

02:08.417 --> 02:10.209
<i>He also works here.</i>

02:15.001 --> 02:18.209
<i>Pasi is the smartest guy I know.</i>

02:19.459 --> 02:23.084
<i>He might not be totally normal;
he remembers everything.</i>

02:23.334 --> 02:27.001
<i>Like, every song he's ever heard.
- Hi.</i>

02:27.251 --> 02:30.292
<i>Pasi works in the library.
- You have Justin Bieber?</i>

02:30.417 --> 02:34.542
<i>We have Scandinavia's biggest
metal record collection in town.</i>

02:34.667 --> 02:37.001
Excellent choice.

02:38.501 --> 02:40.626
Uruguayan grindcore metal.

02:51.251 --> 02:53.542
<i>Listen to that blast beat.</i>

02:55.417 --> 02:57.251
<i>That's one hell of a beat.</i>

02:57.542 --> 02:59.834
<i>Jynkky is the toughest guy
in our band.</i>

03:00.042 --> 03:01.876
<i>He's not afraid of anything.</i>

03:09.792 --> 03:12.001
What? Did he die again?

03:15.501 --> 03:20.251
Dilated pupils are a sign of
the brain not getting enough oxygen.

03:20.376 --> 03:22.501
Jynkky!

03:25.417 --> 03:30.626
All right.
- Yeah. Let's continue.

03:36.001 --> 03:38.376
<i>Jynkky dives into things headfirst.</i>

03:38.584 --> 03:41.167
<i>That's why he's been
declared dead twice.</i>

03:43.167 --> 03:46.167
<i>He's so eager to gig abroad.</i>

03:46.417 --> 03:49.126
<i>I'm not so sure about performing.</i>

03:58.542 --> 04:01.876
<i>We've known each other
since we were kids.</i>

04:02.001 --> 04:05.001
<i>I guess we were all
some kind of outcasts.</i>

04:05.376 --> 04:07.292
<i>This music is our thing.</i>

04:07.542 --> 04:11.167
<i>Other guys can play hockey
and drive around chasing pussy.</i>

04:11.292 --> 04:13.251
<i>We play metal.</i>

04:31.001 --> 04:35.084
Dinner's ready. You coming to eat?
- Hell yeah.

04:37.334 --> 04:39.084
We're done rehearsing.

04:42.251 --> 04:45.001
Why do we always have reindeer?

04:45.917 --> 04:48.167
I'll eat yours.

04:49.751 --> 04:54.251
Your playing makes the reindeer
want to kill themselves.

04:54.376 --> 04:57.917
Soon I'll be out of work.
- Not funny.

04:59.251 --> 05:03.584
Boys, the meaning of life
is like a clitoris.

05:03.709 --> 05:06.334
You move around it,
but you can never be sure -

05:06.459 --> 05:09.417
you've found it.
- You haven't.

05:10.042 --> 05:13.084
I've tried.
- Quiet. Not in front of the boys.

05:13.251 --> 05:17.417
That was good practice!
- That's right.

05:17.584 --> 05:20.834
We're getting there.
- The sound was perfect.

05:22.459 --> 05:25.376
It would be awesome
to play that cover at a real gig.

05:26.626 --> 05:29.542
If we played that,
people would be floored.

05:29.834 --> 05:33.709
There's a club in Oulu
where they have new bands.

05:33.834 --> 05:36.751
Seriously?
- Yeah. What do you say?

05:36.917 --> 05:39.417
I mean, we've been practicing
12 years.

05:39.542 --> 05:42.001
That would be damn cool.

05:45.001 --> 05:47.751
No gigs before we've written
our own songs.

05:49.834 --> 05:55.001
We're not playing covers.
- Yeah, we need to write songs.

05:55.792 --> 05:59.876
I wonder what it would be like
to be onstage playing.

06:12.251 --> 06:15.334
Morning!
- Morning!

06:49.001 --> 06:52.917
I'm happy you provide the residents
with entertainment.

06:54.167 --> 06:56.667
Kolehmainen in Room 9 shit
his pants again.

06:56.792 --> 06:58.626
Again?
- Again.

06:59.376 --> 07:02.417
Hurry up
before I throw my panties at you.

07:09.376 --> 07:13.542
Better to shit yourself than to be
forever constipated. - Right.

07:13.667 --> 07:16.042
It's his birthday today, -

07:16.167 --> 07:18.876
so please go get flowers
when you have time.

07:23.542 --> 07:27.167
Thank you.
- You're welcome.

07:27.917 --> 07:29.792
Hi, Turo.
- Good morning.

07:31.042 --> 07:34.876
You came to buy flowers?
- Yeah.

07:35.834 --> 07:37.834
Come on in.

07:41.167 --> 07:43.792
I need some kind of a bouquet.

07:44.084 --> 07:47.001
One of our residents
has a birthday today.

07:47.167 --> 07:52.001
How about some roses and
a gerbera? - Sounds good.

07:52.126 --> 07:56.292
How about a blue one like this?
That would be unique. - Sure.

07:56.834 --> 07:58.459
Here we go.

07:59.584 --> 08:02.834
How's the band?
- We're doing okay.

08:04.917 --> 08:09.167
Any gigs coming up?
- We haven't got any yet.

08:09.709 --> 08:13.417
I remember you dreaming about
being in a band already in school.

08:14.001 --> 08:17.334
And you always performed
in school plays.

08:17.626 --> 08:23.626
I played a rock because I was
so shy. - That's rock 'n' roll.

08:29.751 --> 08:31.501
Miia!

08:31.667 --> 08:35.083
Miia. You...
- Oh, hi, Jouni.

08:35.501 --> 08:42.667
You look like an angel today.
- Jouni Tulkku himself.

08:42.876 --> 08:45.417
What brings the entertainer
to our shop?

08:45.542 --> 08:48.626
You know why I'm here.
You wanna go for a drive?

08:48.792 --> 08:53.084
I'm going to Kuusamo;
we could have dinner there.

08:53.251 --> 08:57.167
That would be nice,
but I'm busy here.

08:58.126 --> 08:59.792
Here you are, Turo.
- Thanks.

08:59.917 --> 09:04.251
Let me tie these.
That'll be 20 euros.

09:04.417 --> 09:07.334
Oh, Turo. I didn't notice you.

09:07.459 --> 09:13.334
Miia captures my attention totally.
- Right.

09:14.626 --> 09:17.834
Jouni, you remember
Turo also has a band?

09:18.042 --> 09:19.751
Oh. Really?

09:20.167 --> 09:24.834
That's nice. I mean,
it's nice to meet a fellow musician.

09:25.042 --> 09:28.542
If I can do anything to help you
in the music business, -

09:29.001 --> 09:31.542
<i>just ask.
No questions asked.</i>

09:33.209 --> 09:35.917
Really?
- Anytime.

09:36.042 --> 09:39.417
I gotta go. See you later.

09:39.751 --> 09:42.917
Stay wonderful.
- Right.

09:44.626 --> 09:46.417
Bye!

09:48.834 --> 09:51.417
I gotta go, too.
- Okay.

09:56.167 --> 09:58.834
Come back soon!

10:06.542 --> 10:09.001
We have a heavy metal band.

10:13.334 --> 10:17.126
We've been looking
for a condenser mic... - Listen.

10:17.251 --> 10:22.126
I don't give a pussy hair about
your metalhead faggot band.

10:22.542 --> 10:26.626
You can stick the condenser mic
up your ass for all I care.

10:28.917 --> 10:32.126
One more thing.

10:32.501 --> 10:35.334
In the future, go buy your greens
somewhere else.

10:35.459 --> 10:38.209
I've been warming that chick up
for a long time, -

10:38.334 --> 10:40.084
and you ain't gonna ruin it.

10:41.001 --> 10:44.042
Some might say I work too hard
to get laid, but I say, -

10:44.167 --> 10:46.334
<i>"The chase is better
than the catch."</i>

10:46.459 --> 10:49.584
You know?
No, you don't know a fucking thing.

10:49.792 --> 10:54.667
Go get haircut.
I'll go get laid.

10:54.792 --> 10:58.792
With my dick. A pussy.
A woman's pussy.

11:15.459 --> 11:17.417
Homo!

11:40.876 --> 11:44.417
Moilanen,
are you smuggling drugs?

11:44.542 --> 11:46.792
Jouni said you went
to the flower shop -

11:46.917 --> 11:50.542
to woo my daughter. - I bought
flowers for one of our residents.

11:50.667 --> 11:54.167
What? - I bought
flowers for one of our residents.

11:55.001 --> 11:57.167
I didn't let her move
to the city -

11:57.292 --> 11:59.626
because I didn't want her
to end up -

11:59.751 --> 12:02.001
dating a glue sniffer like you.

12:02.126 --> 12:05.459
She needs a real man.
I know the perfect son-in-law.

12:05.584 --> 12:07.792
Jouni Tulkku?
- He's a good man.

12:08.626 --> 12:12.209
He's a player.
- What? Say that again.

12:13.709 --> 12:16.834
I mean, I play.
In a heavy metal band.

12:17.376 --> 12:19.001
You're a hippie.

12:19.126 --> 12:21.917
Make sure the flowers end up
in a vase -

12:22.042 --> 12:24.417
and not in a pipe
in one of your drug dens.

12:24.834 --> 12:27.751
Or I'll lock all of you up.

12:30.667 --> 12:34.376
Did you call Jouni a player?
- No, I didn't.

12:44.459 --> 12:46.834
Now we're gonna write a song.

12:48.334 --> 12:50.042
Okay, let's do it.

12:51.417 --> 12:54.167
What the hell.
That's what we'll do.

13:00.584 --> 13:03.834
How does the song start?

13:05.501 --> 13:08.084
Lotvonen, you have a riff'?

13:09.501 --> 13:12.542
I have a couple of ideas.

13:16.834 --> 13:19.667
"Walk" by Pantera. 1992.

13:23.001 --> 13:25.084
How about this?

13:28.292 --> 13:33.084
Children of Bodom:
"Everytime I Die." 2000. Laiho.

13:40.292 --> 13:46.334
Mors Subita: "The Sermon."
Finnish melodic death metal.

13:52.334 --> 13:57.751
"Crucified." Necrobutcher
of Infernal Legions. 1989.

14:09.376 --> 14:14.334
Turo,
why don't you write lyrics first?

14:16.001 --> 14:18.501
What should I write about?

14:19.084 --> 14:23.459
Heavy metal lyrics are usually
based on mythology, -

14:23.584 --> 14:28.084
occultism, satanism,
or crappy fantasy literature.

14:28.209 --> 14:33.334
You can also write
about your personal misfortunes.

14:35.667 --> 14:38.126
Those I've got plenty of.
- That's right.

14:39.126 --> 14:40.792
He's right.

15:04.251 --> 15:06.126
What the hell...

15:19.167 --> 15:21.584
What the hell.

15:29.167 --> 15:31.376
Darn!

15:49.709 --> 15:51.584
That's it.

15:53.042 --> 15:55.167
That's it.

15:59.626 --> 16:02.709
Jynkky, this is it.

16:07.751 --> 16:11.626
Are you stupid?
This is our sound!

16:15.167 --> 16:17.542
This is a pure blast beat!

16:18.001 --> 16:21.459
The souls of hundreds of
reindeers screaming in pain -

16:21.584 --> 16:24.209
on their way to reindeer hell.

16:26.292 --> 16:30.501
When we turn this into a song,
grannies will go crazy.

16:33.167 --> 16:36.084
I was thinking
it would go like this.

16:49.584 --> 16:51.584
I've never heard anything like it.

16:52.834 --> 16:57.667
It has a bit of Forced Vomit's
"Vominatorium Excalibur," -

16:58.209 --> 17:00.334
but the sound is unique.

17:02.542 --> 17:06.126
I'll start with the riff.
Then Jynkky and Pasi join in.

17:06.251 --> 17:09.751
Pasi, should we start
on the same beat? - Sure.

17:11.001 --> 17:13.751
Then my solo.
- No solo.

17:14.751 --> 17:17.251
Then we'll all headbang in sync.

17:17.376 --> 17:19.001
One, two, one, two...

17:19.126 --> 17:22.751
Okay, let's go.
- Yeah.

17:23.876 --> 17:29.251
This is "Flooding Secretions,"
meaning "shit on your thighs."

19:08.376 --> 19:13.042
Goddammit! We've never
played as brutally as we just did!

19:13.376 --> 19:15.751
And this was our song.

19:15.876 --> 19:19.001
There's a lot of message
in your lyrics, Turo.

19:19.126 --> 19:21.417
Yeah, a lot of words.

19:21.542 --> 19:25.209
Look at this. Our first demo.

19:25.792 --> 19:27.876
Now we make tons of copies -

19:28.001 --> 19:32.792
and send them to record
companies, agencies and studios.

19:33.501 --> 19:36.292
Turo, I'll write your number on it.
- Mine?

19:36.667 --> 19:41.834
You're the front man,
so you can take care of publicity.

19:46.667 --> 19:48.292
Come help me, son.

19:48.417 --> 19:52.209
Some guy pulled
into the driveway. A foreigner.

19:57.584 --> 20:01.709
What if he's an EU inspector?
I've taken a few liberties -

20:01.834 --> 20:05.584
interpreting the directives.
- Let's go ask.

20:19.459 --> 20:22.917
Who is he?
- I guess he's an EU inspector.

20:24.126 --> 20:25.917
Doesn't look like one.

20:33.917 --> 20:35.709
Does he have money?

20:37.667 --> 20:42.917
We sure as hell have blood.
This ain't no flower shop.

21:02.792 --> 21:05.042
Tell him this is supersharp.

21:44.584 --> 21:46.209
Oh.

22:01.917 --> 22:04.667
<i>Goddammit! Shit!</i>

22:09.084 --> 22:11.001
Goddammit!

22:11.334 --> 22:13.584
I'm sure
I'm gonna lose my permit now.

22:17.834 --> 22:20.834
Isn't that the logo of
the metal festival in Norway?

22:21.001 --> 22:23.917
The biggest one in the Cap
of the North. - Who was he?

22:24.042 --> 22:28.209
"Frank Massegrav,
festival promoter."

22:29.126 --> 22:32.084
Jynkky! What are you doing?

22:45.209 --> 22:48.501
<i>What the hell are you doing?</i>

23:22.417 --> 23:26.001
What did you say to him?
- I gave him our demo.

23:27.417 --> 23:31.167
Guys, we're gonna play
at a festival! - What?

23:31.917 --> 23:33.876
Guys, you know what?

23:34.042 --> 23:37.751
I have a feeling
this could be something.

23:42.834 --> 23:44.626
A gig in Norway.

24:03.751 --> 24:06.376
Oh hi, Turo.

24:07.667 --> 24:10.042
What's up?

24:10.292 --> 24:12.751
We might have a gig coming up.

24:14.417 --> 24:17.042
At a festival in Norway.
- What?

24:17.167 --> 24:20.792
That's huge!
- I don't know about it...

24:20.917 --> 24:23.251
Congratulations!

24:26.584 --> 24:31.001
Miia, dazzling as always.
Turo, looking like you always do.

24:31.084 --> 24:34.292
Guess what? Turo and his band
have a gig in Norway.

24:34.417 --> 24:36.834
It's not that big a deal.
- It is.

24:37.001 --> 24:42.084
That's... great.
Will you play for an audience?

24:42.251 --> 24:45.167
The gig is at a festival.

24:46.376 --> 24:49.917
I'm so happy for you. Fuck.

24:50.584 --> 24:52.251
Why don't we get going.

24:52.376 --> 24:55.084
Turo must be busy
with the upcoming gig.

24:55.209 --> 24:57.126
Hop in.

24:57.292 --> 25:00.542
Turo, that was great news.

25:00.667 --> 25:03.001
Hop in.
- Rock rock.

25:03.084 --> 25:04.917
Rock.
- Awesome news!

25:05.042 --> 25:07.001
Awesome indeed.

25:34.209 --> 25:36.334
Turo, hi!

25:41.751 --> 25:44.042
You want a beer?

25:49.667 --> 25:52.751
A gig in Norway. No frigging way!
That's cool.

25:53.042 --> 25:56.501
The farthest Jouni's band
has been is Kiiminki.

26:03.542 --> 26:07.751
I have to say you rock.

26:10.084 --> 26:12.459
Hats off to you.

26:16.334 --> 26:18.376
Thanks.

26:27.251 --> 26:29.751
We got a new resident
in the closed ward.

26:29.876 --> 26:32.626
A really dangerous one.
Don't go into his room.

26:32.751 --> 26:35.126
Hand the linens over
through the hatch.

26:35.417 --> 26:37.751
Got it?
- Got it.

26:38.834 --> 26:40.584
Or do you want me to do it-

26:40.709 --> 26:44.459
now that you got the gig coming up?
- I'll take care of it.

26:44.584 --> 26:46.209
Sure thing.

27:19.501 --> 27:22.001
Why so scared'?

27:23.876 --> 27:27.167
Huh?
- I've never seen a...

27:28.334 --> 27:31.001
A Laplander?
- Yeah.

27:42.001 --> 27:45.126
I've got linens. Clean ones.

27:45.792 --> 27:50.334
If I come in,
will you take it easy? - Sure.

28:09.126 --> 28:11.501
I'm Turo.
- Oula.

28:26.751 --> 28:30.126
Oula! Calm down, goddammit!

28:51.334 --> 28:54.084
What's that music?
- Metal.

28:54.251 --> 28:56.001
What?
- Metal.

28:56.084 --> 28:58.792
Metal? Well well.

28:59.626 --> 29:04.292
Remember not to shake hands
with him or move abruptly.

29:05.001 --> 29:08.167
It triggers aggression in him.

29:08.376 --> 29:10.459
He was in reform school
in Pello, -

29:10.584 --> 29:14.917
but they couldn't handle him there.
- Yeah, he didn't sound local.

29:15.042 --> 29:16.667
Right.

29:20.626 --> 29:26.251
Imagine, the Northern Damnation
Festival in Norway.

29:26.376 --> 29:28.917
We're on stage.
There's a huge audience -

29:29.042 --> 29:31.834
holding their breath
in anticipation.

29:32.001 --> 29:35.251
More and more people gather
in front of the stage.

29:35.376 --> 29:38.167
They're there to see us.

29:38.917 --> 29:43.209
We walk onstage;
the lights are bright.

29:43.376 --> 29:47.251
A thousand people
stare at us intensely.

29:47.417 --> 29:50.334
Then it's all quiet;

29:50.459 --> 29:53.917
even the audience is
nervous as hell.

29:55.251 --> 29:57.626
I give the beat
with a click of the sticks.

29:57.751 --> 30:01.209
Lotvonen lets out one hell
of an avalanche of riffs.

30:01.334 --> 30:03.292
Pasi beats the bass like mad.

30:03.417 --> 30:07.751
Then Turo lets out a metal growl.
The audience is floored.

30:08.126 --> 30:11.042
This is one hell of a thing.

30:11.334 --> 30:16.126
I knew Frank would call you
right away and offer us a gig.

30:16.834 --> 30:19.626
He must've liked our song.

30:19.834 --> 30:21.626
Jynkky...

30:27.542 --> 30:31.751
Yeah, he mentioned the main stage.
- Main stage?

30:31.876 --> 30:39.001
What the hell. There's gonna be
at least 3,000 people.

30:39.126 --> 30:41.126
Damn.
- Or 10,000.

30:41.251 --> 30:44.084
He really liked our demo.

30:44.209 --> 30:48.001
You gotta like it.
The whole village has gone crazy.

30:48.126 --> 30:50.459
I even got a discount
at the hot dog stand.

30:50.584 --> 30:52.751
How are we gonna get to Norway?

30:53.001 --> 30:56.584
We need a bigger car.
Jynkky's car is too small.

30:56.751 --> 31:00.751
And we need a name. A good one.
- Yeah.

31:00.876 --> 31:02.834
And a logo.
- Yeah.

31:03.584 --> 31:07.376
Jouni's gigging at the hotel.
Wanna go have a laugh at him?

31:08.417 --> 31:10.584
Let's go!
- Let's go.

31:11.459 --> 31:14.834
Guys, you need to help me
get my car started.

31:16.584 --> 31:21.792
The name has to have two words.
In English. Like Forced Vomit.

31:22.084 --> 31:24.001
Fetal Death?

31:24.834 --> 31:26.667
Fetal Death.

31:26.792 --> 31:29.251
Let's not get small kids
involved in this.

31:29.376 --> 31:31.626
How about Blood Poisoning?

31:32.001 --> 31:36.084
Eternal Tears of Sorrow?
- No way.

31:36.209 --> 31:38.626
How about Exorcised Vomit?

31:39.209 --> 31:42.251
Possessed Vomit.
- That's pretty nasty.

31:44.542 --> 31:46.167
Vomit is good.

31:52.376 --> 31:56.251
<i>I'm thirsty
Your spring is a shower</i>

31:56.376 --> 31:59.792
<i>I'm thirsty
The nectar of your flower</i>

32:00.042 --> 32:05.126
<i>My parched lips
Awaiting the rain to start</i>

32:10.626 --> 32:12.917
Look.

32:14.542 --> 32:16.792
The rock stars are here!

32:29.001 --> 32:34.209
<i>Who will extinguish this fire
in my heart</i>

32:35.292 --> 32:37.251
<i>I salute.</i>

32:37.917 --> 32:42.834
We'll have a small break.
We'll continue in a moment.

32:46.542 --> 32:51.709
May I have your attention.
I'd like to say a couple of words.

32:52.626 --> 32:56.917
On behalf of our municipality
and our residents, -

32:57.834 --> 33:00.917
I'd like to present this pennant
to you.

33:04.084 --> 33:06.167
Here you are.

33:06.542 --> 33:12.501
I heard
your band will play a gig -

33:12.709 --> 33:15.251
at a music event in Norway.
ls it true?

33:17.417 --> 33:21.667
Yes. I was actually
supposed to tell you...

33:25.876 --> 33:32.001
Our gig is going to be shown
on Norwegian TV live. - Excellent.

33:32.126 --> 33:34.042
Good luck.

33:37.001 --> 33:39.042
I wish you all luck.

33:45.126 --> 33:48.792
Proud of you. Proud of you.

33:49.084 --> 33:51.001
Goddammit.

33:55.042 --> 33:59.667
Jynkky. Give me
Frank's business card. - Sure.

34:00.209 --> 34:03.084
I need to discuss
some practical things. - Right.

34:03.209 --> 34:06.667
Let him know our rider.
- Yeah.

34:06.917 --> 34:10.833
We need to give him a list
of the things we want backstage.

34:11.001 --> 34:15.583
Tomorrow we'll go buy a van
from Tulkku.

34:15.876 --> 34:19.333
We need space for all of our stuff.
- And we need band photos.

34:20.542 --> 34:22.417
Hi.
- Hi.

34:22.542 --> 34:26.583
I kinda accidentally blurted out
the news about your gig.

34:26.708 --> 34:30.001
It's so great
I just had to tell everyone.

34:30.126 --> 34:32.208
That's okay.
- Good.

34:32.458 --> 34:36.376
It's great you're going all the way
to Norway to play a gig.

34:36.501 --> 34:41.542
Is it your first gig? - Yeah,
we thought we'd start at the top.

34:41.792 --> 34:45.167
Although it wouldn't hurt
to practice as an opening act.

34:45.458 --> 34:48.208
But it's a little hard
to get one around here.

34:48.333 --> 34:50.333
Jouni.

34:51.542 --> 34:54.542
Miia. Should we finally check
the backstage out?

34:54.667 --> 34:57.792
Why don't you take the boys
as your opening act.

35:00.292 --> 35:05.001
Right. Well...
I wonder how that would work out.

35:05.126 --> 35:07.542
Give the boys a chance.

35:08.917 --> 35:13.376
Well, it would be a nice change
to have a comedy act here.

35:14.501 --> 35:17.792
So what do you say, Moilanen?
You wanna open -

35:17.917 --> 35:20.417
for the Star Mustaches
next Saturday?

35:20.792 --> 35:23.126
Say yes!

35:24.001 --> 35:27.334
Sure.
- Yes!

35:27.542 --> 35:31.459
That's awesome! Thanks, Jouni,
that's so nice of you!

35:31.584 --> 35:35.084
My pleasure.
- Yes!

35:39.209 --> 35:42.209
What kind of music
do you retards even play?

35:42.501 --> 35:45.542
Symphonic post-apocalyptic
reindeer-grinding -

35:45.667 --> 35:49.084
Christ-abusing extreme
war pagan Fennoscandian metal.

35:51.126 --> 35:53.417
No wonder
you're not getting any pussy.

35:53.542 --> 35:57.584
And who stuck a pole up his ass?
One of you?

35:58.251 --> 36:00.251
Frigging ghost.

36:04.334 --> 36:07.167
Impaled Ass...

36:15.751 --> 36:18.334
We want the best van
we can get for this money.

36:19.251 --> 36:24.001
That's 260.
- Yeah. What can we get with it?

36:24.084 --> 36:28.751
A snow tire and gonorrhea.
Barely.

36:31.126 --> 36:35.209
Okay, I'll trade my Peugeot 205
for the van.

36:35.334 --> 36:37.167
XL?
- Yeah.

36:38.876 --> 36:44.292
285 euros.
I might have a van for you.

36:52.751 --> 36:56.209
This is it.
It has a beautiful patina.

36:56.626 --> 36:59.209
It's seen a lot of life.
Or actually death.

36:59.376 --> 37:02.584
This van has killed
three large animals and one person.

37:02.709 --> 37:05.667
A dwarf. Chinese, I think.

37:06.001 --> 37:10.001
Then it was buried in a swamp.

37:10.167 --> 37:14.209
It was used
in a bank robbery in Sweden.

37:14.501 --> 37:16.876
And a circus professional,
a clown, -

37:17.001 --> 37:19.584
killed himself
in the passenger seat.

37:23.501 --> 37:25.501
It's the van of death.

37:26.251 --> 37:28.084
<i>The death van.</i>

37:29.459 --> 37:32.417
Yes. We'll take it.

37:35.709 --> 37:37.667
Okay.

37:42.417 --> 37:45.501
Jynkky, why don't you lend me
your old drums.

37:45.626 --> 37:48.084
We'll take them
to the care home. - Why?

37:48.209 --> 37:49.834
For music therapy.

37:50.001 --> 37:54.667
Fuck! It clicked again.
That damn speed camera haunts me!

37:54.792 --> 37:56.667
We could've taken another road.

37:56.792 --> 37:59.126
I've been taking this road -

37:59.251 --> 38:01.542
since before
I got my driver's license.

38:01.667 --> 38:04.334
I ain't taking back roads
because of that cam.

38:04.459 --> 38:06.251
That cost me 100 euros.

38:12.584 --> 38:17.126
Sweet Jesus on a stick!
I never would've believed it.

38:18.001 --> 38:21.251
Take new linens to him.
And then there's Kolehmainen...

38:23.001 --> 38:26.876
I heard you have a gig at the hotel.
- Yeah.

38:27.084 --> 38:30.876
A bunch of the staff
will be there.

39:03.001 --> 39:04.917
This is a great song!

39:07.667 --> 39:09.626
What is it?

39:09.834 --> 39:13.292
My buddies and I have a band.
- Are you famous?

39:14.001 --> 39:16.001
I don't know about that.

39:16.626 --> 39:20.876
We probably have a couple of gigs
coming up, though. - Listen.

39:22.251 --> 39:24.834
I'm sorry about last time.

39:25.917 --> 39:29.292
I sometimes lose it.
You see, I'm crazy.

39:32.459 --> 39:35.001
Just kidding!

39:36.209 --> 39:38.084
Don't you have a sense of humor?

39:38.209 --> 39:41.001
I haven't seen much humor
in anything lately.

39:41.126 --> 39:42.876
Why are you so serious?

39:44.667 --> 39:47.376
This one thing got out of hand.

39:52.459 --> 39:56.292
Everybody's expecting a lot of me.

39:58.584 --> 40:01.334
What if I screw up and
ruin everything?

40:01.459 --> 40:04.751
Boy, the only way to get rid of
your fears is facing them.

40:04.876 --> 40:06.709
You see, -

40:06.876 --> 40:13.251
there's a tribe in Africa
that steals food from lions.

40:13.542 --> 40:15.501
They're fearless young men.

40:15.626 --> 40:20.292
They just walk up to the lions
as if they owned the forest.

40:20.459 --> 40:25.209
The lions are stunned
when someone isn't scared of them.

40:25.334 --> 40:29.876
The warriors just snatch their kill
right in front of them.

40:33.376 --> 40:36.709
Are you from there?
- Nearby.

40:37.001 --> 40:39.501
I'm from Karigasniemi,
Finnish Lapland!

40:40.751 --> 40:45.001
I saw it on TV.
In a nature documentary.

40:46.751 --> 40:49.209
We don't have that many lions
around here.

40:49.417 --> 40:52.667
You don't really get metaphors,
do you?

40:54.001 --> 40:58.417
We all have our lions to face.

41:05.501 --> 41:08.667
What are we doing here?
- I'm hungry.

41:40.459 --> 41:42.459
Pasi.

41:43.042 --> 41:46.292
That's one hell of a costume.

41:52.001 --> 41:54.292
There's no more Pasi.

41:54.542 --> 41:57.167
There's only Xytrax.
- Xytero?

41:57.292 --> 41:59.709
Xytrax.
- Xytero?

41:59.876 --> 42:04.834
It's a pseudonym.
All the legends have pseudonyms.

42:05.126 --> 42:09.167
Trollhorn, King Diamond,
Nuclear Holocausto.

42:09.584 --> 42:11.834
And now Xytrax.

42:15.917 --> 42:18.584
Here's our logo.

42:21.126 --> 42:23.542
Iskender Kebab.
That's cool.

42:23.667 --> 42:27.292
I love iskender kebab.
- No, Impaled Rektum.

42:27.709 --> 42:31.292
That's our name. Impaled ass.
- That's even better.

42:31.417 --> 42:35.251
Impaled Rektum.
That's brutal.

42:36.709 --> 42:39.334
And now we'll take a promo shot.

42:41.417 --> 42:43.626
More.

42:44.251 --> 42:46.001
That's too much.

42:46.292 --> 42:49.001
Turn it towards the swamp.
No...

42:49.167 --> 42:51.251
Which swamp?
- It was good.

42:51.459 --> 42:54.042
Clockwise.
- Your clockwise or mine?

43:10.376 --> 43:12.167
That's it.

43:14.251 --> 43:17.751
How can we get the photo?

43:19.709 --> 43:22.917
From the police station.
- Yeah.

43:25.376 --> 43:28.084
It took a photo. Let's get going.

43:28.334 --> 43:31.042
Jynkky, I need a ride.
I need to do one thing.

43:44.542 --> 43:47.709
I've never been here before.

43:50.209 --> 43:54.917
Wait here; I won't be long.

43:58.626 --> 44:02.084
No. I'm coming with you.

44:02.209 --> 44:05.042
I'm not going to wait here
by myself.

44:05.501 --> 44:07.501
RANUA ZOO

44:08.459 --> 44:11.167
What an amazing place.

44:15.792 --> 44:18.251
Bears are such big animals.

44:18.667 --> 44:21.334
You can't tell
from TV or in photos.

44:21.501 --> 44:25.584
But here you can see
that they're damn big.

44:33.834 --> 44:38.709
Wolves kill for fun, you know?

44:39.001 --> 44:42.001
They practice killing
with reindeers.

44:42.334 --> 44:48.001
There must be a whole pack of them
in the back.

44:58.376 --> 45:00.001
How cute!

45:04.917 --> 45:09.626
Turo, what the hell?
- We all have our lions to face.

45:09.751 --> 45:14.167
That's a wolverine.
- It's a metaphor.

45:14.292 --> 45:16.751
Don't. What the hell...Turo!

46:36.501 --> 46:39.834
We have liver casserole at home.
You could've eaten that.

46:48.501 --> 46:51.834
What in the world happened to you?
- Nothing really.

46:52.001 --> 46:55.792
I've just been wrestling
with a couple of things. - Okay.

46:56.292 --> 46:59.209
Are you coming to see our gig
tomorrow? - Of course.

46:59.334 --> 47:01.126
Good.

47:05.792 --> 47:08.542
You need anything else?

47:10.167 --> 47:11.834
That's it.

47:23.334 --> 47:25.042
I was thinking...

47:25.792 --> 47:28.042
Would you like to have coffee
with me?

47:29.626 --> 47:32.834
Sure, I love coffee. With buns.

47:33.751 --> 47:36.084
Yeah, with buns.

47:36.667 --> 47:38.376
It's a deal.

47:53.917 --> 47:58.251
What did I tell you?
Leave my daughter alone!

47:58.459 --> 48:01.709
Throw that baton back!
You hear me'?

48:01.834 --> 48:04.251
REINDEER AND COUGAR

48:19.417 --> 48:21.792
The place is packed!

48:22.626 --> 48:25.209
What's that?
- Pyrotechnics.

48:25.751 --> 48:27.376
Good idea.

48:27.501 --> 48:29.459
I gotta go to the bathroom.

48:32.084 --> 48:34.001
Fuck!

48:51.792 --> 48:53.542
Turo Moilanen.

49:29.834 --> 49:32.376
Turo, let's go!

49:47.626 --> 49:51.792
Thank you.
Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.

49:51.917 --> 49:55.709
I'm a generous guy, so I'm giving
a group of local boys a shot.

49:55.834 --> 49:59.667
Some wild rock 'n' roll
to kick off the night...

49:59.792 --> 50:03.667
What was the name of your band?
- Impaled Rektum.

50:05.126 --> 50:11.251
Please welcome:
lmpure Recluse!

50:24.167 --> 50:26.709
Oops. Sorry.

50:56.792 --> 50:58.792
Turo!

51:17.001 --> 51:19.876
Oh dear. Oh dear.

51:24.626 --> 51:28.376
No one gets it right every time.

51:28.501 --> 51:33.292
That was great. Your gig in Norway
will be a success.

51:33.459 --> 51:35.209
There will be no gig in Norway.

51:35.334 --> 51:38.126
Turo Moilanen
would like to say something.

51:38.584 --> 51:41.042
There will be no gig in Norway!

51:41.167 --> 51:43.542
What?
- There never was.

51:43.667 --> 51:46.126
What the fuck, Turo?
- Homo!

51:46.251 --> 51:47.917
No frigging Way...

51:48.876 --> 51:50.709
Everything's fine...

52:08.084 --> 52:10.584
What the hell have you done.

52:11.167 --> 52:13.834
Yes...
- Shut up!

52:16.542 --> 52:20.126
You're lucky if the mayor
doesn't press charges against you -

52:20.251 --> 52:24.501
for property damage
or lying through your teeth.

52:25.501 --> 52:33.167
And your so-called car.
I'm confiscating it.

52:33.292 --> 52:35.751
It hasn't been inspected
in two years.

52:36.042 --> 52:40.167
We bought it from Jouni.
- Don't drag him into this!

52:40.542 --> 52:43.376
He said he told you
it hasn't been inspected.

52:43.501 --> 52:47.334
He didn't.
- Shut up!

52:47.501 --> 52:50.167
Give me the keys.

52:56.459 --> 53:00.001
You damn raccoon. What is it?

53:01.042 --> 53:06.417
We recently took a promo shot-

53:07.126 --> 53:08.917
with the speed cam...

53:09.042 --> 53:12.084
Could we get the photo
as soon as possible? - What?

53:12.376 --> 53:15.626
It's a promo shot for the band.

53:15.751 --> 53:20.417
That's what you did?
- Yeah, we did.

53:20.542 --> 53:23.251
No, you can't have it!

53:23.501 --> 53:26.709
The photo is government property.

53:28.459 --> 53:31.292
Make sure you don't leave town.

53:31.876 --> 53:33.542
Miia!

53:34.876 --> 53:36.751
Let's go.

53:43.042 --> 53:45.459
Impaled Rektum.

53:45.792 --> 53:48.917
First gig and
a huge scandal and a lot hate.

53:49.626 --> 53:52.084
Very good.

53:52.417 --> 53:54.917
I should've known
this was going to happen -

53:55.042 --> 53:58.667
when glue-sniffing criminals
are allowed to mingle -

53:58.792 --> 54:00.542
with good citizens.

54:00.667 --> 54:02.792
Dude, you lied.

54:04.084 --> 54:06.292
It got out of hand.
- Shut up!

54:06.584 --> 54:09.001
I'm darn mad.

54:13.417 --> 54:15.376
This isn't working.

54:18.042 --> 54:19.792
I quit.

54:21.584 --> 54:24.501
Turo. You're not going to quit,
are you?

54:26.709 --> 54:29.709
Everything has sucked
the whole time.

54:30.876 --> 54:33.542
We should've
stayed in Lotvonen's basement.

54:33.667 --> 54:37.001
Turo. That's not what bands do.

54:37.542 --> 54:40.542
Bands play for people.
Other people.

54:40.667 --> 54:45.376
Well, what did you think of our gig?
- It was damn impressive!

54:45.501 --> 54:49.126
Not very many bands
have first gigs like that.

54:49.376 --> 54:51.376
Besides, we have a gig in Norway.

54:51.501 --> 54:54.626
There's no gig in Norway.
There never was.

54:54.751 --> 55:00.542
I don't care
if we play in the parking lot.

55:00.667 --> 55:03.376
We made it this far.
I don't want to give up.

55:03.501 --> 55:07.001
I'm going to Norway
even if I'm dead!

55:07.876 --> 55:11.417
We don't even have a car.
- I'll get the van back.

55:11.542 --> 55:14.251
And then we'll go. I'll call you.

55:21.334 --> 55:23.584
Hi.
- Hi.

55:26.501 --> 55:29.376
Have you seen Turo?
- No.

55:29.501 --> 55:34.251
Okay. Where's Jouni?

55:39.876 --> 55:43.501
I've been going
through rough times.

55:43.917 --> 55:47.501
My grandmother is terminally ill,
among other things.

55:47.626 --> 55:50.001
Don't pull on my suit.
I use it onstage.

55:50.126 --> 55:52.667
Hi.
- Yeah.

55:52.834 --> 55:54.584
This doesn't concern you.

55:57.292 --> 55:59.376
Want to have a threesome?

55:59.501 --> 56:01.417
Why don't you go to hell.

56:05.626 --> 56:09.209
I don't know her.
Continue.

56:29.042 --> 56:32.001
POLICE

57:09.126 --> 57:11.001
Shit.

57:56.417 --> 57:59.251
We'll be home soon.

58:39.542 --> 58:41.167
Shitty cam!

59:05.667 --> 59:08.917
We have gathered here
to see Jyrki Kalevi Pätsi off -

59:09.042 --> 59:10.834
on his final journey.

59:11.001 --> 59:16.292
Jyrki managed to experience
many things during his short life.

59:17.042 --> 59:22.001
His wick of life burned
with a big flame.

59:22.834 --> 59:28.667
The water of life flowed
in his heart, clear like a crystal.

59:29.292 --> 59:31.626
Does anyone have anything to say -

59:31.751 --> 59:35.917
before we commit his body
to the ground?

59:42.709 --> 59:45.042
To my best friend.

59:51.001 --> 59:55.876
The Jynkky Special.
Without pickles.

59:56.251 --> 59:58.917
Because you were special too.

01:00:04.667 --> 01:00:09.292
"In the misty morning,
on the edge of time."

01:00:10.792 --> 01:00:13.459
"We've lost the rising sun."

01:00:14.626 --> 01:00:18.209
"We sailed across the air
before we learned to fly.“

01:00:19.917 --> 01:00:22.501
"We thought that it could
never end."

01:00:24.167 --> 01:00:28.084
"We're lost children of the sea."

01:00:29.542 --> 01:00:34.042
Ronnie James, Dio. 1980.

01:00:39.001 --> 01:00:41.501
I have to go to work.

01:00:41.626 --> 01:00:45.167
My dad thinks I should take over
the slaughterhouse -

01:00:45.292 --> 01:00:48.084
while he still has
most of his arms and legs left.

01:00:48.709 --> 01:00:51.792
I also have a lot of work.

01:01:02.667 --> 01:01:06.917
I haven't changed my plans.

01:01:21.417 --> 01:01:24.459
Hi.
- Hi.

01:01:25.042 --> 01:01:27.626
Come on in.

01:01:28.834 --> 01:01:30.876
It's a bit messy here.

01:01:33.126 --> 01:01:34.792
Are you moving?

01:01:35.167 --> 01:01:37.501
No. I'm just packing old junk away.

01:01:38.126 --> 01:01:42.209
Blood motor.

01:01:47.667 --> 01:01:51.001
It's a bit childish to have posters
on the walls at my age.

01:01:52.042 --> 01:01:55.126
How's the band?
- Well...

01:01:56.584 --> 01:01:58.209
I don't know.

01:01:59.501 --> 01:02:01.709
I got pissed.
- What?

01:02:02.334 --> 01:02:04.876
I thought I'd be good.

01:02:05.709 --> 01:02:08.042
I should've known
I'd screw it up -

01:02:08.417 --> 01:02:11.084
if I tried to sing
in front of people.

01:02:12.917 --> 01:02:15.209
I'm glad we quit.

01:02:15.459 --> 01:02:19.709
Goddammit! No way in hell!
Are you gonna give up too?

01:02:19.834 --> 01:02:25.042
Well... I have to move on.

01:02:25.501 --> 01:02:28.501
I have to think about others.
- You can't be serious.

01:02:28.667 --> 01:02:31.376
You're the reason
I've been thinking -

01:02:31.501 --> 01:02:34.501
about going to school in Oulu.

01:02:34.626 --> 01:02:37.417
And now you're giving up!

01:02:37.751 --> 01:02:40.751
There's nothing selfish
about being yourself!

01:02:41.876 --> 01:02:47.042
Greetings from the police station.
You can burn it if you want.

01:03:19.084 --> 01:03:21.126
Jynkky, dammit.

01:03:29.501 --> 01:03:32.167
What the hell. Let's go.

01:03:35.292 --> 01:03:40.084
Hey, Moilanen? Are you gay
because you're so pretty?

01:03:40.209 --> 01:03:42.167
Yeah.

01:03:49.917 --> 01:03:53.417
Gays are real men. Manly men.

01:03:54.667 --> 01:03:57.834
Are your keys in the car?
- Yeah.

01:03:58.001 --> 01:03:59.834
Good.

01:04:04.001 --> 01:04:07.001
Hey!

01:04:07.876 --> 01:04:11.292
This sounded horrible.
As if someone was killing a pig.

01:04:12.292 --> 01:04:14.584
They didn't kill a pig.

01:04:16.084 --> 01:04:18.209
It was a goat.

01:04:42.709 --> 01:04:45.626
They recorded this song
with a microphone -

01:04:45.751 --> 01:04:49.792
that was
in a dead sheep's carcass.

01:04:59.417 --> 01:05:01.042
All right.

01:05:22.542 --> 01:05:24.167
What the hell...

01:05:36.917 --> 01:05:38.542
Goddammit!

01:05:44.417 --> 01:05:46.376
Oula, calm down.

01:05:49.792 --> 01:05:51.542
Pasi.
- It's Xytrax.

01:05:51.667 --> 01:05:55.001
Put our demo on.

01:06:22.084 --> 01:06:25.126
Where are you taking me?
- To Norway.

01:06:25.251 --> 01:06:27.501
What the hell
am I going to do in Norway?

01:06:27.626 --> 01:06:31.251
You'll play symphonic
postapocalyptic reindeer-grinding -

01:06:31.376 --> 01:06:34.709
Christ-abusing extreme war pagan
Fennoscandian metal.

01:06:48.626 --> 01:06:53.001
Border Guard. - This is Police
Chief Kujanpää from Taivalkoski.

01:06:53.126 --> 01:06:56.917
You speak Finnish?
- Yes, a little.

01:06:57.042 --> 01:07:00.834
A gang of Devil worshippers
are on their way to the border.

01:07:01.001 --> 01:07:03.626
They're driving a van.

01:07:03.876 --> 01:07:06.459
They dug up a grave.
Close the border.

01:07:06.584 --> 01:07:11.001
We'll only close the border
if it's something serious, -

01:07:11.209 --> 01:07:13.251
such as a terrorist threat.

01:07:13.376 --> 01:07:15.292
They are terrorists!

01:07:15.417 --> 01:07:19.417
I'm sure they're all funta...
funda...

01:07:19.542 --> 01:07:21.751
Fundamentalists?
- Yes.

01:07:21.876 --> 01:07:26.334
I'll pass your message
onto my superiors. - OK.

01:07:40.001 --> 01:07:41.917
<i>Colonel Dokken.</i>

01:07:43.126 --> 01:07:47.042
<i>Sorry for disturbing you, but I got
an emergency call from Finland.</i>

01:07:47.167 --> 01:07:51.459
<i>A group of Finnish terrorists
are going to cross the border.</i>

01:07:51.709 --> 01:07:53.626
<i>We were asked to stop them.</i>

01:07:55.542 --> 01:07:57.751
<i>I knew this day would come.</i>

01:07:59.792 --> 01:08:03.167
<i>Call the Delta Troops.
- Delta Troops?</i>

01:08:03.292 --> 01:08:05.917
<i>You mean
those voluntary military troops?</i>

01:08:06.042 --> 01:08:08.209
<i>The safety of the country
is at stake!</i>

01:08:08.334 --> 01:08:10.001
<i>We need all the troops.</i>

01:08:10.084 --> 01:08:15.584
<i>We're the last line of defense!
And we won't back down.</i>

01:08:17.417 --> 01:08:21.417
<i>Angelo...
You'll be smokin' hot soon.</i>

01:08:33.792 --> 01:08:39.042
<i>You're here because you're the best
of the best.</i>

01:08:43.251 --> 01:08:47.334
<i>You're here
because your country needs you.</i>

01:08:47.667 --> 01:08:50.001
<i>Because you're fearless.</i>

01:08:50.126 --> 01:08:52.126
<i>Because</i> -

01:08:53.334 --> 01:08:55.084
<i>you live nearby.</i>

01:08:55.459 --> 01:08:57.709
<i>Using force is recommended.</i>

01:08:57.834 --> 01:09:01.626
<i>Let's give these terrorists
a welcome they'll never forget!</i>

01:09:04.084 --> 01:09:07.001
<i>Oh my God, here we go again.</i>

01:09:15.376 --> 01:09:18.751
Judah, sulking is forbidden
at a bachelor party.

01:09:19.376 --> 01:09:21.417
Hey, I can drive us back.

01:09:21.542 --> 01:09:25.167
Jesus and the disciples is
the best idea ever -

01:09:25.292 --> 01:09:27.001
for a bachelor party.

01:09:27.667 --> 01:09:31.334
Look what I got!

01:09:32.001 --> 01:09:36.792
This keeps getting better!

01:09:39.917 --> 01:09:43.459
Judah, turn the music down.

01:10:12.876 --> 01:10:15.667
You missed one hit.

01:10:27.084 --> 01:10:31.834
<i>I assume you understand
the importance of gun safety.</i>

01:10:32.001 --> 01:10:35.751
<i>Don't point it at me.
Oh God.</i>

01:10:38.334 --> 01:10:40.751
<i>Take your finger off the trigger!</i>

01:10:42.542 --> 01:10:44.167
<i>Grenade!</i>

01:11:01.167 --> 01:11:03.542
What the hell?

01:11:07.126 --> 01:11:08.917
What the hell?

01:11:16.209 --> 01:11:19.459
<i>Colonel, with all due respect,
this makes no sense.</i>

01:11:19.584 --> 01:11:23.584
<i>We need to ask headquarters
for backup. - A car!</i>

01:11:33.584 --> 01:11:35.459
<i>Angelo!</i>

01:11:36.167 --> 01:11:38.792
<i>You can't shoot them!
- Just a warning shot.</i>

01:11:54.459 --> 01:11:57.876
<i>Sergeant, arrest those men.</i>

01:12:27.876 --> 01:12:30.126
We better drive nice and slow.

01:12:59.209 --> 01:13:03.084
I'm glad
border control is on the job.

01:13:05.917 --> 01:13:07.876
<i>Say "cheese"!</i>

01:13:29.917 --> 01:13:33.584
You stopped the wrong car!

01:13:35.584 --> 01:13:37.792
<i>We stopped the wrong car.</i>

01:13:44.709 --> 01:13:47.084
Guys, we're in Norway!

01:13:47.417 --> 01:13:52.376
Go, Sweden!

01:14:34.084 --> 01:14:36.334
We're not gonna get stuck here,
are we?

01:14:43.084 --> 01:14:44.834
Brake!
- I am braking.

01:14:45.001 --> 01:14:46.876
Brake better!

01:14:48.667 --> 01:14:51.792
No!

01:14:52.626 --> 01:14:55.876
Shit!
- No!

01:15:15.376 --> 01:15:17.209
<i>The megaphone!</i>
- <i>What the</i> hell?

01:15:17.334 --> 01:15:19.042
You'll stay in the car.

01:15:25.126 --> 01:15:26.876
MY Van!

01:15:28.917 --> 01:15:30.584
Hey!

01:15:34.792 --> 01:15:36.792
Dad!

01:15:58.501 --> 01:16:01.126
What the hell
are they talking about?

01:16:02.542 --> 01:16:04.292
Hey.

01:16:04.834 --> 01:16:06.709
It can't end like this.

01:16:06.834 --> 01:16:10.751
Listen, mop-tops!
It's the end of the road now.

01:16:11.584 --> 01:16:13.834
You'll be locked
away for a long time.

01:16:14.001 --> 01:16:16.584
The longer you wait,
the longer the sentence.

01:16:20.126 --> 01:16:21.834
Guys.

01:16:23.417 --> 01:16:25.376
Listen.

01:16:36.584 --> 01:16:40.001
What are we gonna do?
Are we gonna give up?

01:16:43.334 --> 01:16:45.626
Darn it!

01:16:59.876 --> 01:17:03.001
I say we follow Jynkky.

01:17:25.126 --> 01:17:27.667
And I'm the one
they keep in a closed ward.

01:18:20.501 --> 01:18:24.709
We died and went to hell.

01:18:25.167 --> 01:18:29.167
I'd say
this is either Asgard or Valhalla.

01:18:57.917 --> 01:19:00.334
<i>Wasn't this supposed to be
a fantasy game?</i>

01:19:00.792 --> 01:19:03.376
<i>These guys look
like Finnish metalheads.</i>

01:19:03.501 --> 01:19:07.042
<i>This is a Middle Age SCA,
not fantasy larping.</i>

01:19:07.417 --> 01:19:10.876
<i>Do you always have to play a fairy?
- Yes.</i>

01:19:12.501 --> 01:19:16.876
<i>Damn Legolas.
- Hey! Take us down!</i>

01:19:17.584 --> 01:19:20.751
<i>Next time
it's your turn to be crucified!</i>

01:19:44.001 --> 01:19:45.917
Land ho!

01:19:46.209 --> 01:19:48.167
Northern Damnation!

01:20:58.876 --> 01:21:03.209
<i>Right, boys?
- Damn.</i>

01:21:17.751 --> 01:21:20.417
Hey, where do you think
you're going?

01:21:20.626 --> 01:21:24.001
There are all kinds of bums
ready to cause trouble for you.

01:21:24.792 --> 01:21:27.667
Dad, you can't protect me
for the rest of my life.

01:21:29.376 --> 01:21:33.251
I'm going to the festival.
Try to behave.

01:21:33.584 --> 01:21:36.042
You understand?

01:21:53.001 --> 01:21:54.876
What are you doing?

01:21:56.084 --> 01:21:58.709
This won't feel like mine
if I don't do this.

01:22:05.751 --> 01:22:07.709
I gotta go to the bathroom.

01:22:15.209 --> 01:22:18.584
It'll go well.
- Miia.

01:22:20.459 --> 01:22:22.834
What the hell are you doing here?

01:22:23.001 --> 01:22:25.084
I've seen enough of back home.

01:22:25.251 --> 01:22:27.334
And I wanted to see your gig.

01:22:28.376 --> 01:22:30.834
I'm your number one fan,
after all.

01:22:32.626 --> 01:22:34.542
Show them what you got.

01:22:48.251 --> 01:22:51.042
I've been wanting
to tell you something.

01:23:00.917 --> 01:23:02.709
Rock rock!

01:23:13.876 --> 01:23:15.709
Fuck!

01:23:18.126 --> 01:23:19.751
Yes!

01:23:48.917 --> 01:23:51.209
He got it wrong.

01:23:58.584 --> 01:24:02.751
Jynkky, we're playing
Northern Damnation!

01:26:22.584 --> 01:26:24.584
<i>Shields!</i>

01:26:49.834 --> 01:26:53.084
Let the boys play some more.

01:26:53.334 --> 01:26:55.917
The vocalist might be
my future son-in-law.

01:26:58.209 --> 01:27:01.001
<i>What?</i>
- Son-in-law.

01:27:40.376 --> 01:27:44.251
<i>Sometimes it's better to just
do things and think afterwards.</i>

01:27:44.376 --> 01:27:47.751
<i>Dare to screw up. Or like
our resident Kolehmainen said,</i> -

01:27:47.917 --> 01:27:51.376
<i>"Better to shit yourself
than to be forever constipated."</i>

01:27:51.501 --> 01:27:54.834
<i>We'll do some time. But
that just adds to our street cred.</i>

01:27:55.001 --> 01:27:58.709
<i>Pasi's pleased.
I don't know about Lotvonen.</i>

01:27:59.001 --> 01:28:01.459
<i>I think he'll miss his reindeers.</i>

01:28:01.876 --> 01:28:04.126
<i>Oula doesn't seem to mind.</i>

01:28:04.334 --> 01:28:07.542
<i>At least he got a break
from being locked up.</i>

01:28:10.334 --> 01:28:14.876
<i>But one thing all of us boys
can agree on.</i>

01:28:15.376 --> 01:28:17.876
<i>You'll hear from Rektum again.</i>

01:29:42.709 --> 01:29:45.751
