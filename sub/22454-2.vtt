'I wonder what kind of socks
Sophie wears.

00:28.357 --> 00:32.589
'Do women wear socks? Well, yes,
sometimes is the answer to that.

00:32.637 --> 00:38.473
'Socks before or after trousers, but never
socks before pants - that's the rule.

00:38.517 --> 00:41.236
'Makes a man look scary, like a chicken. '

00:42.477 --> 00:46.993
'He just does not give one solitary shit. '

00:47.037 --> 00:49.267
'Yeah, take that, big Suze.

00:49.317 --> 00:52.036
'Your toilet-seat regime is over.

00:52.077 --> 00:55.069
'Ah, freedom! '

00:55.117 --> 00:58.632
'Brown for first course,
white for pudding.

00:58.677 --> 01:01.794
'Brown is savoury,
white's the treat. '

01:01.837 --> 01:05.432
'I'm the one who's laughing
because I love brown toast. '

01:05.477 --> 01:07.468
'There he is. '

01:07.517 --> 01:10.350
- Dr J!
- Good morning, Mark.

01:10.397 --> 01:13.912
Sorry I didn't hook up
with you and Super Hans...

01:13.957 --> 01:18.826
- 'Wedge of ballast, then bed again. '
- Barbara pops up. "Is the file ready?"

01:18.877 --> 01:22.790
'It's a bit like the crusher in Star Wars
but red hot.

01:22.837 --> 01:25.988
'What if Mum and Dad
were trapped in one

01:26.037 --> 01:30.030
'and I had a hook to rescue one of them -
who would I pick? '

01:30.077 --> 01:33.433
I didn't get a chance to tell you
the good news.

01:33.477 --> 01:37.106
We need a clerical assistant
and I've swung you an interview.

01:37.157 --> 01:39.113
- Uh-huh.
- 'Clerical assistant?

01:39.157 --> 01:42.069
'I can't be a clerical assistant.
I'm a musician.

01:42.117 --> 01:45.632
'You wouldn't ask the Chemical Brothers
to do your laundry. '

01:45.677 --> 01:48.555
So is tomorrow at 11 all right?

01:49.597 --> 01:52.714
Tomorrow at 11.
Yeah, sure. I'll set the video.

01:52.757 --> 01:54.827
- 'Don't joke. '
- 'I'm not. '

01:54.877 --> 01:58.870
It's a damn good company
and it'll be the two of us together -

01:58.917 --> 02:01.385
Jez and Mez, the El Dude Brothers.

02:01.437 --> 02:05.066
It's just the music.
It's really starting to hot up.

02:05.117 --> 02:08.792
You know how much
I respect your music. It's just...

02:08.836 --> 02:12.671
Super Hans got a bass loop
for our track that is so good

02:12.717 --> 02:16.869
that when he tried turning it off,
he physically couldn't do it.

02:16.917 --> 02:21.069
I'm on your side.
Every artist needs his patron

02:21.117 --> 02:23.108
but, you know, there's a limit.

02:23.157 --> 02:25.273
Oh. The rent.

02:25.317 --> 02:29.515
I'm not some kind of land baron
trying to milk his cash cow.

02:29.557 --> 02:32.549
- It's just...
- Don't worry, you'll get your milk.

02:32.597 --> 02:35.430
- This track's a banker.
Somethin' Stupid)

02:35.477 --> 02:38.867
- Everybody needs a Somethin' Stupid.
- Sorry?

02:38.917 --> 02:40.635
The guy who wrote that,

02:40.677 --> 02:45.751
he's probably up to his neck
in penny loafers and blue pool tables.

02:45.797 --> 02:49.585
- Right.
- Blimey, what's God up to?

02:49.637 --> 02:54.074
- 'So let's do just a... '
- Just in case the song doesn't work out,

02:54.117 --> 02:57.746
maybe you'd better fill this out
and fax it over by three.

02:57.797 --> 02:59.515
Hmm.

02:59.557 --> 03:02.594
Think about it.
And have a great day. Yeah?

03:02.637 --> 03:05.834
- See you tonight.
- Yeah, cool. Have a good one.

03:05.877 --> 03:08.152
- You, too, mate.
- Bye, mate.

03:09.997 --> 03:12.386
'Tight-fisted cock-muncher. '

'Next time I have breakfast,
he'll make me sit a fucking exam. '

03:18.917 --> 03:22.671
'I wonder what
Sophie's flirty cartoon will be today? '

03:22.717 --> 03:26.630
- 'I really should ask her out for lunch. '
- Can you hold that?

03:28.677 --> 03:30.668
'You bastard. '

03:31.717 --> 03:34.072
Thanks Third floor?

03:37.157 --> 03:41.389
'I mean, what's the worst
that could happen? She could say no. '

03:41.437 --> 03:46.227
'Actually, that would be terrible.
It would destroy me if she said no. '

03:46.277 --> 03:50.509
There is a notice
about only riding the lift to the first floor.

03:50.557 --> 03:54.630
You're wasting mine and other people's
time, not to mention...

03:54.677 --> 03:57.271
Oh. Er, OK.

03:57.317 --> 04:01.230
'People like him should wear stickers.
Their cars have them.

04:01.277 --> 04:03.347
'Oh, yeah. Great idea, Adolf. '

04:03.397 --> 04:06.036
- Morning, Mark.
- Hey, Sophie.

04:06.077 --> 04:08.910
- 'Go on, ask her! '
- Sophie, are you...?

04:08.957 --> 04:10.106
I mean, would...?

04:10.157 --> 04:14.355
How's your day going thus far?
Have a nice shower or bath?

04:14.397 --> 04:17.036
- Why? Do I smell?
- God, no, you don't.

04:17.077 --> 04:20.274
I mean, you smell nice -
not that I've smelt you.

04:20.317 --> 04:22.308
Oh... See ya.

04:22.357 --> 04:24.348
Later, potater.

04:24.397 --> 04:26.433
'Oh, potater. What have I become? '

04:28.237 --> 04:33.357
'Super Hans said he'll be here
in 20 minutes. Means I've got an hour.

04:33.397 --> 04:36.275
'I bet Mark's got some porn here
somewhere. '

04:36.317 --> 04:39.150
'OK, where's today's cartoon? '

04:39.197 --> 04:41.028
'Mm, not bad.

04:41.077 --> 04:44.149
'No discernible romantic overtones.

'OK, pen, let's flirt with Sophie... '

04:47.677 --> 04:51.272
'Mark's got no conception.
He thinks I'm so...

04:51.317 --> 04:55.151
'But I'm busting my creative balls here,
day in, day out.

"'No, you don't like the attack dog,
do you, Mr Keats?"

'Hold on...
I think I've struck the motherload! '

'What the hell is that?

'I'm giving her a love heart.

'Yes, that's... good.

'No, no, it's not good. It's terrible.

'Think "crazy horse", think
"in your face". What would Jeremy do?

like this cartoon?

- I dunno.

06:35.637 --> 06:38.993
- Yeah, it's zzzhhhh! In your face.
- It's just...

06:40.237 --> 06:43.274
I don't like it.

06:44.197 --> 06:45.710
No, well, I do.

06:45.757 --> 06:48.715
- I just don't.
- Oh, right. This is it, is it?

06:48.757 --> 06:52.545
- The end of the Hair Blair Bunch.
- We are not the Hair Blair Bunch.

06:52.597 --> 06:56.112
- Whatever. Spunk Bubble.
- Momma's Kumquat.

06:56.157 --> 06:59.911
No, it's not. I never agreed to it
being Momma's Kumquat.

06:59.957 --> 07:05.714
Look, if this is John and Paul, 1970,
then I need money for the equipment.

07:06.397 --> 07:09.355
This is like your whole
Balearic bullshit, innit?

07:09.397 --> 07:14.517
One minute, it's all, "I love ya, man,"
the next, it's, "Where's that 50 quid?"

07:14.557 --> 07:17.629
- I'm just saying I need money...
- Listen, mate.

07:17.677 --> 07:19.747
Shit is as shit does, my friend.

07:22.797 --> 07:27.188
Look, this is bullshit.
We can't just let the Hair Blair Bunch go.

07:27.237 --> 07:29.546
We are not the Hair Blair Bunch!

07:29.597 --> 07:34.796
'A bloody swastika. That is
the single worst single bloody idea ever.

'Yeah, perfect plan. "I want
to fax this off. Oh, Toni, I feel tired. "

'Hope she gets out the bong,
not the cafetiere. '

07:57.957 --> 08:01.552
I was wondering.
You're an urban, switched-on lady.

08:01.597 --> 08:04.395
You've probably got
a fax machine, right?

08:04.437 --> 08:07.793
A fax machine?
Right, like I'd have a fax machine.

08:07.837 --> 08:10.067
Have you just come from the 1980s?

08:10.117 --> 08:13.587
It's like The Spaceman And King Arthur,
but in reverse.

08:15.077 --> 08:18.547
Yeah. I've just got
this crappy job application.

08:18.597 --> 08:21.395
Right. OK.

08:22.997 --> 08:25.033
Tell me something, Jeremy.

08:25.077 --> 08:28.956
Have you ever tried washing up
without using washing-up liquid?

08:28.997 --> 08:31.716
What? Has Mark been talking to you?

08:31.757 --> 08:36.467
Could you clean a pot or a pan
without using a scrubbing brush,

08:36.517 --> 08:38.985
a sponge or a scouring pad?

08:39.037 --> 08:41.835
- I don't think so.
- So what you're saying is

08:41.876 --> 08:46.234
these products are essential -
products no one could do without?

08:46.277 --> 08:50.156
Well, you're kind of
making me say that but...

08:50.197 --> 08:55.669
The first thing to say is that this is
definitely not pyramid selling, OK?

08:57.517 --> 08:59.508
Right. Good.

09:00.517 --> 09:02.553
What's pyramid selling?

09:02.597 --> 09:05.634
'Enter the pit of Sarlak,
little crisps.

09:05.677 --> 09:08.145
'She's ignoring me.

09:08.197 --> 09:11.906
'Of course, she's ignoring me.
I sent her a swastika.

'Jesus! This is the worst thing
to happen to anyone ever and...

09:16.317 --> 09:19.150
'Relax, Mark.
You're not Hitler in his bunker.

'He was really under the cosh.

09:21.517 --> 09:25.556
'Mind you, at least he had a girlfriend.
OK, enough mooning.

'Let's strap on the nosebag
and eat some serious work. '

09:28.957 --> 09:31.596
I mean, does that look like
a pyramid to you?

09:31.637 --> 09:34.674
Clearly, it's not a pyramid. It's a pie.

09:34.717 --> 09:40.269
And... it's like a big, lovely club
with free money for everyone?

09:40.317 --> 09:43.832
- It sounds great, but...
- Free money for everyone.

09:43.877 --> 09:48.189
Ha! Look out the window.
That'll never happen in this old world.

09:48.237 --> 09:51.354
No, see, the early birds

09:51.397 --> 09:56.596
are going to find their bird table
covered in money pie.

09:58.237 --> 10:01.274
- Right...
- But the Johnny and Sally Come-Latelys,

10:01.317 --> 10:04.673
they get a slice of the pie
but then they look closer

10:04.717 --> 10:07.595
and - oh, dear - it's only pastry.

10:07.637 --> 10:10.026
Boo-hoo, Johnny and Sally.

10:10.077 --> 10:12.068
Are you with me?

10:13.997 --> 10:16.750
'Blown it with Sophie.
Who's next?

10:16.797 --> 10:18.469
'Big Suze?

10:18.517 --> 10:21.827
'Never met her.
Not necessarily a disadvantage.

'Why don't I ever get
this fucking thing fixed?!

10:25.877 --> 10:29.552
'Every night... Ah, it always comes out
eventually. Fuck it. '

10:31.157 --> 10:36.231
- Hey, Mark. Liked the cartoon.
- Oh, I'm so... You did?

10:36.277 --> 10:40.475
Yeah, it's meant to be me and Barbara
from Personnel, right?

10:40.517 --> 10:43.827
And... she's handing me
this heart of holiday pay

10:43.877 --> 10:47.756
but in the heart, it's just...

10:47.797 --> 10:50.186
- Race hate?
- Exactly.

10:50.237 --> 10:53.274
That's so Barbara. She's such a racist.

10:53.317 --> 10:56.309
Huh, huh. Right. Exactly.

10:56.357 --> 11:00.430
Listen, Sophie, I was wondering
if I could get your home number.

11:00.477 --> 11:05.426
I mean, for work, in case I need to
swap a shift or... That is, if you don't...

11:05.477 --> 11:07.627
No, I don't, if that's what you want.

11:07.677 --> 11:09.668
'She's actually writing it. '

11:11.477 --> 11:13.468
There you go. See you later.

11:14.517 --> 11:17.156
Oh, hang on. This isn't enough numbers.

11:18.197 --> 11:20.188
Oh, no, it is enough numbers.

11:21.237 --> 11:24.354
'Oh, God, I hope she doesn't mind
about my balls. '

11:25.237 --> 11:30.072
'One step out of line. The slightest hint
of maverick behaviour and you're out. '

11:30.117 --> 11:35.350
Exactly. If it's such a bad thing to do
things by the book, there'd be no book.

11:35.397 --> 11:40.949
'Must keep an eye on him if
he gets it. JLB doesn't need a maverick. '

11:40.997 --> 11:44.592
- So anyway, things went rather well -
- I bet he did it.

11:45.637 --> 11:47.946
Oh, what? Just because he's black?

11:47.997 --> 11:49.988
No, I mean, not because...

11:50.037 --> 11:53.825
- He was at the garage at the beginning.
- I know what you meant.

11:53.877 --> 11:57.313
Anyway, in the end,
I got Sophie's number.

11:57.357 --> 12:00.667
We know he's the only one
with the key to the lock-up.

12:00.717 --> 12:04.630
So do you think I should give her a call?
I probably should.

12:04.677 --> 12:07.714
- I don't know if I should.
- Maybe you should.

12:07.757 --> 12:13.275
OK, listen, if God's doing mountains
or sky or water, I'll call.

12:13.317 --> 12:19.870
- If he's doing trees or critters, I won't.
- All right, let God decide. Ready?

12:19.917 --> 12:21.908
Yeah, sky!

12:21.957 --> 12:23.948
Right, here goes.

12:24.877 --> 12:27.835
'And with a large brush,
I'm gonna... '

12:27.877 --> 12:33.907
'The following names were
presented to us by temping agencies. '

12:33.957 --> 12:36.471
- Answerphone.
- Ah, you see!

12:36.517 --> 12:38.747
He did do it, but for a nice reason.

12:38.797 --> 12:41.391
Who's the racist now, Mark?

12:41.437 --> 12:45.828
Er, Sophie. If you heard that,
please ignore it. I'm not a racist.

12:45.877 --> 12:47.868
Far from it.

12:47.917 --> 12:49.908
Anyway...

12:49.957 --> 12:53.791
It's good to hear your voice.
I know it's only a recording

12:53.837 --> 12:57.796
but you have got a bloody nice voice

12:57.837 --> 13:00.192
and...

13:00.237 --> 13:03.786
God, I just called up to say hi and then...

13:04.837 --> 13:09.672
? Then I go and spoil it all
by saying something stupid like...

13:10.717 --> 13:12.708
? I like you?

13:12.757 --> 13:14.748
I mean, not that.

13:14.797 --> 13:17.072
But anyway...

13:17.117 --> 13:22.271
I noticed that the paper in
the photocopier is running a bit low so...

13:22.317 --> 13:24.911
I know it's not really your job but...

13:24.957 --> 13:28.108
You know, so... See you tomorrow.

13:28.157 --> 13:29.875
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck!

13:29.917 --> 13:31.316
- Oh, fuck!
- Oh, my God.

13:31.357 --> 13:34.793
- Jesus!
- I've really fucked it. Have I fucked it?

13:34.837 --> 13:36.634
Maybe it was charming.

13:36.677 --> 13:41.307
- It was the behaviour of an oddball.
- No, not an oddball. A maverick.

13:41.357 --> 13:43.791
You may not play by the rules, but...

13:43.837 --> 13:45.828
by Christ, you get results.

13:45.877 --> 13:49.267
Come on, let's go and have a drink.
Forget about it.

13:49.317 --> 13:52.354
Have you forgotten about
the phone call yet?

13:52.397 --> 13:54.388
- No.
- Right.

13:55.437 --> 14:00.113
How much washing-up do you think
you could do without washing-up liquid?

14:00.157 --> 14:05.185
- I'm sorry?
- Exactly. And friends and colleagues?

14:05.237 --> 14:07.592
Everyone needs cleaning products

14:07.637 --> 14:10.356
and that's never gonna change, right?

14:10.397 --> 14:14.549
- Why are you talking like this?
- Very interesting question.

14:14.597 --> 14:18.192
The first thing to say is
that this is not pyramid selling.

14:18.237 --> 14:21.547
- You're doing pyramid selling?
- Not pyramid selling.

14:21.597 --> 14:27.706
- I can't believe you're pyramid selling.
- Listen, it's not, it's network marketing

14:27.757 --> 14:30.396
and it's a guaranteed money-making...

14:30.437 --> 14:33.076
- I've seen the charts.
- Oh, the charts.

14:33.117 --> 14:38.874
- You didn't tell me about the charts!
- Are you trying to piss on my bonfire?

14:38.917 --> 14:41.226
I'm trying to protect you from...

14:41.277 --> 14:43.108
pissing all over yourself.

14:43.157 --> 14:47.833
I'm not about to piss
all over myself. I'm...

14:47.877 --> 14:50.072
I'm pissing... into the big time.

14:50.117 --> 14:54.030
- You're still coming to the interview.
- Well, I thought...

14:54.077 --> 14:58.992
Listen, Jeremy. You don't understand.
Nothing you want will ever happen.

14:59.037 --> 15:03.986
That's the real world. Your hair isn't red.
People don't walk on stilts.

15:04.037 --> 15:09.111
Maybe somewhere, you can earn a living
drinking margaritas through a straw

15:09.157 --> 15:12.945
but in this world, you've got to turn up,
log on and grind out.

15:12.997 --> 15:14.908
But if you get in early...

15:14.957 --> 15:18.233
Come Friday,
you will owe me three months' rent.

15:18.277 --> 15:20.313
You're coming to the interview.

15:20.357 --> 15:22.427
OK.

15:22.477 --> 15:27.187
'I'll come to the interview,
all right, but I won't be getting the job. '

15:27.237 --> 15:29.228
What?

15:29.277 --> 15:31.268
Er, nothing, just...

15:31.317 --> 15:33.308
something funny.

15:33.357 --> 15:35.348
Can you...?

15:46.037 --> 15:49.552
'Maybe she did find it charming.
Yeah, maybe.

15:49.597 --> 15:55.194
'Just work out her... I could say
Jeremy had a gun and made me sing it

15:55.237 --> 15:58.912
'because he's a crackhead
and he does that all the time.

15:58.957 --> 16:03.314
'Yeah, that sounds great - me in my
crack house. You can be a crack bitch

16:03.357 --> 16:05.154
'and sit on my... Shit!

16:05.197 --> 16:09.952
'Shit, piss, poo, pants, bollocks.
Yes, blitzkrieg! I'm in the Ardennes!

16:09.997 --> 16:14.229
'You can't touch me in the Ardennes,
concealed in the cupboard.

16:14.277 --> 16:18.236
'Everything's OK in the cupboard.
I'm safe in the cupboard. '

16:19.277 --> 16:21.268
Mark?

16:21.317 --> 16:25.310
- You're in the stationery cupboard.
- That's right, Jeff.

16:25.357 --> 16:27.348
OK... Right.

16:28.397 --> 16:30.115
Well...

16:30.157 --> 16:33.513
- I hope you're having a good time.
- Yeah, well...

16:33.557 --> 16:35.548
Hi, Mark.

16:35.597 --> 16:37.588
Hi... Sophie.

16:37.637 --> 16:40.231
I'm just in the cupboard right now.

16:40.277 --> 16:44.748
- About the message, we'll talk later, OK?
- Er, yeah, fine.

16:52.677 --> 16:57.228
'Here we go. Operation Come Over
Like An Unemployable Freak. '

16:57.277 --> 16:58.995
Jeremy Osbourne?

16:59.037 --> 17:02.507
Hi, I'm Barbara.
Do you want to walk this way?

17:02.557 --> 17:04.548
Right you are.

17:04.597 --> 17:08.306
I might wobble
because I'm a bit pissed from last night

17:08.357 --> 17:11.429
and I don't want to get your hopes up
cos I must say...

17:11.477 --> 17:16.392
- I'm only really here because...
- Obviously you know Mark Corrigan.

17:16.436 --> 17:20.112
- 'Oh, shit. '
- Mark would be one of your managers.

17:20.156 --> 17:24.594
'Must be careful. Don't want the job
or to piss off the land baron. '

17:24.637 --> 17:27.310
'He looks like crap. '

17:27.357 --> 17:31.066
We have to make sure
we've ticked all the boxes, so to speak

17:31.117 --> 17:33.711
and kept everything above board.

17:33.757 --> 17:38.877
So if I can outline the basic requirements
of the role you'll be undertaking.

17:38.917 --> 17:43.786
You'll be responsible for updating
and maintaining the filing system.

17:43.837 --> 17:47.830
That may not sound important
but the truth is...

17:47.877 --> 17:51.472
'Shit, what's she talking about?
Nod. Look serious.

17:51.517 --> 17:53.906
'I'm Di, she's Bashir. '

17:53.957 --> 17:56.391
...whole company communicates...

17:56.437 --> 17:59.634
'He'll be able
to pay off the Blockbusters fine,

17:59.677 --> 18:02.237
'plus I'll be able to order him around.

18:02.277 --> 18:06.350
'Not horrible, just...
"Jeremy, could you file this for me?

18:06.397 --> 18:08.865
"'Jeremy, could you take that for me?

18:08.917 --> 18:13.672
"'Jeremy, could you suck this for me... "
Jesus! Where did that come from? '

18:13.717 --> 18:17.312
It's a valuable asset.
Do you have any experience in this field?

18:17.357 --> 18:19.746
Er, I've done quite a lot, actually.

18:19.797 --> 18:23.949
I mean, not formal filing
but alphabeti-pi-cising the videos,

18:23.997 --> 18:26.033
doing the spices...

18:26.077 --> 18:29.752
I'd want to build on that experience
in a professional zone.

18:29.797 --> 18:32.027
Sphere. I meant sphere.

18:32.077 --> 18:36.787
'God, that sounded amazing!
Don't accidentally get the bugger. '

18:36.837 --> 18:40.671
We're doing great.

18:40.717 --> 18:43.595
So, I see you used to be a nurse.

18:43.637 --> 18:46.595
Wouldn't filing be a bit of a step down?

18:46.637 --> 18:49.674
Yeah, I suppose it would, actually,

18:49.717 --> 18:53.596
although I'm looking for something
more relaxing.

18:53.637 --> 18:55.832
Challenging. He means, challenging.

18:55.877 --> 18:59.392
- I expect Jeremy knows what he means.
- Yes, right.

18:59.437 --> 19:01.428
No, challenging is right

19:01.477 --> 19:05.026
but a bit more of a relaxing challenge.

19:05.077 --> 19:09.070
More like doing a crossword
than a tracheotomy.

19:09.117 --> 19:11.108
- Right.
- 'Oh, shit.

19:11.157 --> 19:15.594
'My natural bloody charm's
only swinging it. Got to do something. '

19:17.517 --> 19:19.792
- Are you OK?
- What?

19:19.837 --> 19:22.226
- It's just a thing I have.
- What thing?

19:22.277 --> 19:24.074
Facial spasming.

19:24.117 --> 19:27.268
Facial spa... You do not have...

19:27.317 --> 19:30.229
- I do... sometimes.
- Well, er...

19:30.277 --> 19:35.305
I guess that's everything. Jeremy,
is there anything you'd like to ask?

19:35.357 --> 19:37.348
Yes, Barbara. Yes, there is.

19:37.397 --> 19:42.915
How much washing-up do you think you
could do without any washing-up liquid?

19:42.957 --> 19:45.710
- No, Jeremy.
- Where's this...?

19:45.757 --> 19:49.989
- It's a unique business opportunity.
- It's pyramid selling.

19:50.037 --> 19:52.756
- It's not pyramid selling, Mark.
- It is.

19:52.797 --> 19:55.595
- You're making a fool of yourself.
- You're pissing on my bonfire!

19:55.637 --> 19:58.834
- There is no bonfire!
- Because you keep pissing on it!

19:58.877 --> 20:01.630
Sheesh. This is low. This is really low.

20:01.677 --> 20:05.306
Yeah, well, at least I don't fancy
elves and pixies.

20:05.357 --> 20:10.385
What does that mean? I literally have
no idea what that is supposed to mean!

20:10.437 --> 20:12.428
OK...

20:12.477 --> 20:16.470
Well, thanks for coming in.
We'll be in touch.

20:17.917 --> 20:23.674
'Well, that was a fucking disaster.
I want reparations - brutal reparations!

20:23.717 --> 20:27.710
'I want the Rhineland.
It's going to be 1919 all over again.

20:27.757 --> 20:29.907
'Fuck the inevitable backlash!

20:30.957 --> 20:32.948
'OK. It's OK, Mark. Later.

20:32.997 --> 20:34.988
'Now, calm.

20:35.037 --> 20:37.949
'Calm, honest and mature. '

20:37.997 --> 20:39.715
Hi, Sophie.

20:39.757 --> 20:42.590
Hey, Mark.
I just bumped into your flatmate.

20:42.637 --> 20:45.913
- Oh... yeah?
- He kept talking about washing up.

20:45.957 --> 20:50.428
- Very funny. Like Jim Carrey.
- Huh. Yeah, I know what you mean.

20:50.477 --> 20:52.945
'Get your tanks off my lawn, Jeremy. '

20:52.997 --> 20:54.749
But listen, Sophie...

20:54.797 --> 21:00.349
About the message last night.
I want to kind of come clean really.

21:00.397 --> 21:04.231
It's a bit embarrassing but...

21:05.277 --> 21:06.995
Well...

21:07.037 --> 21:09.028
the thing is...

21:09.077 --> 21:14.151
Jeremy, sometimes, for a laugh,
makes me say things with a bread knife.

21:14.197 --> 21:17.951
- He's obviously not a crackhead but...
- Uh-huh. OK.

21:17.997 --> 21:19.988
Yeah.

21:20.037 --> 21:23.507
Look, you don't have to...
About the phone message,

21:23.557 --> 21:26.435
- you don't have to be embarrassed.
- I don't?

21:26.477 --> 21:30.356
- No, it's just one of those things.
- Is it? It is?

21:30.397 --> 21:32.388
Oh, right. Fantastic.

21:32.437 --> 21:35.554
And... you haven't told anyone about it?

21:35.597 --> 21:37.235
Of course not.

21:37.277 --> 21:42.305
- Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you.
- 'Calm down. She's not Pontius Pilate. '

21:42.357 --> 21:43.836
Yeah, well, you know...

21:43.877 --> 21:45.868
The truth is...

21:45.917 --> 21:47.908
The truth is I suppose...

21:47.957 --> 21:49.948
I like you.

21:49.997 --> 21:53.467
That's why I said the song. I like you.

21:53.517 --> 21:55.508
Is that such a crime?

21:55.557 --> 21:59.789
Should I be hounded to the ends
of the earth just for liking you?

21:59.837 --> 22:03.352
I like you and if you can't handle it,
you can just...

22:03.397 --> 22:05.194
you know...

22:05.237 --> 22:07.228
fuck off.

22:07.277 --> 22:09.996
No, no, I think I can handle you liking me.

22:10.037 --> 22:12.426
Good.

22:12.477 --> 22:14.786
Right, excellent. OK.

22:19.517 --> 22:21.508
Bye.

22:30.077 --> 22:32.796
Hi, Mark. Thanks for bringing in Jeremy.

22:32.837 --> 22:34.828
He was quite the find.

22:34.877 --> 22:36.868
Er, yeah...

22:36.917 --> 22:41.593
Right, I'm really sorry.
I mean, I thought it would be a good...

22:41.637 --> 22:43.628
that he might... but...

22:44.677 --> 22:46.668
Hey! Hey, there!

22:46.717 --> 22:49.834
Feeling better now, are we?
Fully recovered?

22:49.877 --> 22:51.788
Hey, I see you!

22:51.837 --> 22:53.828
I see you!

22:53.877 --> 22:56.266
He used to have a limp!

22:56.317 --> 22:58.592
I mean, he pretended to have a limp.

22:58.637 --> 23:00.628
He's a faking little pegleg!

23:13.317 --> 23:14.909
Hi, Jeff.

23:16.277 --> 23:19.986
'Well, fuck you if you're
not doing small talk. I'm not helping.

23:20.037 --> 23:21.755
'Let's die together. '

23:25.797 --> 23:31.872
? And then I go and spoil it all
by saying something stupid like

23:31.917 --> 23:34.556
? I like you?

23:35.597 --> 23:37.872
? And then I go and spoil it all

23:37.917 --> 23:42.513
? By saying something stupid
like I love you

23:44.917 --> 23:49.274
? I can see it in your eyes
that you despise the same old lies

23:49.317 --> 23:52.070
? You heard the night before

23:54.477 --> 23:57.992
? And though it's just a line to you
For me, it's true

23:58.037 --> 23:59.106
? And never seems so...?
