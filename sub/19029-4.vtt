WEBVTT

00:03.549 --> 00:05.884
I can't believe we're doing this
in a patient's room.

00:06.789 --> 00:08.477
It's about to get hotter.

00:10.601 --> 00:12.272
Yyyyes!

00:12.329 --> 00:15.029
- Turk, you are full of surprises.
- Isn't he though?

00:15.403 --> 00:16.673
And what are you doing here?

00:17.100 --> 00:19.566
- He's here to kill you.
- Kill me?

00:20.351 --> 00:21.678
Elliott won't let you get away with it.

00:22.371 --> 00:23.023
Sure I will.

00:23.447 --> 00:24.809
Turk's letting me raise Izzy.

00:25.633 --> 00:27.710
I'll finally have a baby!

00:28.179 --> 00:30.222
And I can spend the rest
of my life with Turk,

00:30.223 --> 00:32.317
touring the world's greatest waterparks.

00:32.391 --> 00:33.267
Elliott, ready.

00:33.571 --> 00:34.905
<i>[KILL CARLA]</i>

00:36.700 --> 00:37.422
Clear!

00:38.886 --> 00:41.032
Noooooooo!!

00:44.677 --> 00:47.182
- That is a weird dream.
- Yeah, I don't even like waterparks.

00:47.374 --> 00:51.333
I mean, I did, until someone thought it'd be
funny to get down the slide 2 secs after me.

00:51.483 --> 00:53.261
- Dude, the lifeguard told me to go.
- Really?

00:53.550 --> 00:55.394
Did he also tell you to take
your trunks off, Turk?

00:55.647 --> 00:57.952
Because the last thing a guy wants to see
when he's in a splashpool,

00:57.964 --> 01:00.927
is your best friend's junk
headed towards me at 40 mph.

01:01.708 --> 01:03.318
Felt like I got pistol-whipped.

01:03.438 --> 01:06.484
Look, what was weird about this dream,
was that it was in English.

01:07.775 --> 01:09.668
I always dream in Spanish!

01:09.842 --> 01:11.956
Baby, dreams have
nothing to do with reality.

01:12.119 --> 01:13.717
Hey, welcome with little Elliott.

01:14.696 --> 01:17.183
What? We saw Izzy hates it,
down at daycare.

01:17.598 --> 01:20.073
They doodoo down there?
You wanna tell me...

01:20.103 --> 01:23.726
<i>Elliott wasn't the only one trying
to steal babies from the hospital.</i>

01:23.756 --> 01:24.285
Hey!

01:24.711 --> 01:25.852
Don't steal those babies!

01:26.832 --> 01:28.544
Why do you call these babies?

01:29.156 --> 01:31.379
It could be that when I was a kid
I didn't have any toys.

01:31.823 --> 01:32.568
Sure, sure. Yeah.

01:32.676 --> 01:36.635
I used to make my own toys. As a matter
of fact, I would take the toilet paper rolls,

01:36.636 --> 01:39.092
and draw little faces on 'em,
and... name 'em.

01:39.645 --> 01:41.681
I surrounded myself with them
hoping they would protect me.

01:42.258 --> 01:44.531
I, uhm, went up to the side of the
road and try to sell'em one time,

01:44.532 --> 01:46.193
make a little money on my own, you know.

01:46.452 --> 01:50.021
But... no one bought any, and when
I came back home Yvonne was gone.

01:50.591 --> 01:52.976
You know how you and I don't
talk so much?

01:53.732 --> 01:56.856
If you're wondering whether or not
that makes me happy or sad,

01:57.529 --> 01:58.641
it makes me happy.

01:59.392 --> 02:00.641
You love being Angie, don't ya?

02:01.146 --> 02:01.933
I do!

02:02.612 --> 02:05.117
Oh, missed the spot. Sad for you!

02:12.333 --> 02:14.472
Ah, fresh pill of the day!

02:16.214 --> 02:19.314
You just can't seem to get along
with anybody, can't you?

02:19.890 --> 02:23.567
Life is so much easier, if you
just connect with people.

02:24.191 --> 02:25.159
Watch and learn.

02:26.020 --> 02:28.648
Colonel Doctor, I'm loving those new frames.

02:28.725 --> 02:31.864
Oh, Snoop Dogg attending!
Then my ho's hot....

02:32.349 --> 02:35.886
Oh, hey. What are you doing to
that thing? It's fluffy.  I wanna like...

02:36.597 --> 02:38.376
rub my fingers in!
You see?

02:38.553 --> 02:42.042
I connect with them.
Unlike you, I'm a man of the people.

02:45.018 --> 02:48.171
Hey, Teddy! Looking bald and sweaty!

02:48.675 --> 02:50.410
Putting my smile away.

02:50.996 --> 02:52.328
And down with the day.

02:54.192 --> 02:55.668
Yeah, that looks like a healthy bone.

02:56.192 --> 02:57.682
- Speaking of healthy bones...
- Perry...

02:57.683 --> 02:58.710
One sec, ma'am.

02:59.222 --> 03:01.669
I've got one in my pants.
He's all yours.

03:02.004 --> 03:03.604
We'll go with this later. Thanks.

03:04.469 --> 03:06.666
- What have you been doing all day?
- Right up until this very moment,

03:06.667 --> 03:08.396
I've been successfully avoiding you.

03:09.021 --> 03:11.448
I came to tell you I'm taking the kids
to my mother's for the weekend.

03:11.573 --> 03:14.596
And seeing that you're not allowed
to it within 40 feet of our house...

03:14.654 --> 03:17.830
- "The restraining order"!
- Chirstmas memories!

03:18.205 --> 03:19.666
Anywho, you're staying here.

03:20.566 --> 03:22.421
I'm gonna leave you alone, to celebrate.

03:24.913 --> 03:26.631
People!

03:27.118 --> 03:28.867
I expect full partecipation.

03:29.651 --> 03:30.809
Woooo!

03:30.810 --> 03:33.385
Woooooooooo!

03:34.779 --> 03:36.720
- Oh please!
- Oh come on!

03:37.038 --> 03:37.735
Fine.

03:38.269 --> 03:39.658
Wooooooooo!

If they do this an all sporting
event, I'm gonna start going.

04:19.101 --> 04:21.062
Check out my little african princess!

04:21.160 --> 04:23.766
Izzieee!

04:23.788 --> 04:26.296
Tu sabes que tu eres el amor de mi vida!

04:26.394 --> 04:29.184
Baby, when I'm not around, do you
want to speak spanish to Izzie? 'Cause

04:29.305 --> 04:30.659
You know I don't understand that.

04:31.080 --> 04:33.529
- Relax Turk, I speak both to her.
- Good.

04:34.588 --> 04:37.809
- Mhh. Honey, I gotta go to work.
- Ok, say goodbye to daddy.

04:38.546 --> 04:40.453
Now, when he comes back,
the three of us

04:40.830 --> 04:45.214
cenaremos juntos y te daremos
un baneto bien tibio.

04:46.031 --> 04:49.270
- before we put you down to bed.
- Forgot my keys!

04:49.630 --> 04:53.805
And then mommy will sing you a lullaby
just like her mommy used to do...

04:54.549 --> 04:56.066
cuando yo ero una nina

04:56.561 --> 05:00.458
y gozaremos muchisimo...Te gusta? Oh...

05:01.165 --> 05:02.637
Hola, Carla.

05:04.103 --> 05:05.355
As I say Hello, right?

05:07.390 --> 05:08.291
I'll be back.

05:09.872 --> 05:12.517
Well, the cars's here, for some reason
it was half an hour early.

05:12.825 --> 05:14.232
Nooo, that was me.

05:15.261 --> 05:17.536
You know, you're gonna miss me
more than I miss you.

05:17.883 --> 05:21.183
Oh please, I don't need those
four pounds of makeup and,

05:21.195 --> 05:24.814
quarter inches of synthetically paralyzed
skin. There is a fight little drunkgirl

05:24.819 --> 05:27.705
but I can already hear blubbering
on the phone...

05:27.706 --> 05:31.918
Oh... Pe... rry... I... miss...
You... So... Ahhhh!

05:32.435 --> 05:36.956
This is you: (whining)
"Oh Jordan, please come home... Please!"

05:37.684 --> 05:39.201
- Ahhhh!
- Uhhhh!

05:39.202 --> 05:40.673
- Ahhhhh!
- Ahhhh!

05:41.078 --> 05:44.111
See? This is why we're a great couple.
Bag!

05:44.599 --> 05:48.091
- Bet you call me before I call you,
you pathetic wuss! -You're on!

05:48.962 --> 05:52.439
Ah! Alone for the weekend.
Wonder what he's gonna do.

05:59.444 --> 06:01.790
- Hi Perry!
- No, no you can't... get out!

06:01.791 --> 06:02.928
- Well, I tought could be fun.
- No.

06:03.942 --> 06:06.113
- He said no.
- But you told me...

06:06.114 --> 06:07.735
Soon few it'd say yes, I...

06:07.736 --> 06:09.320
I did not invite the Todd.

06:09.573 --> 06:11.137
Fellas, why you wear
such giant underwear?

06:12.182 --> 06:15.050
Sometimes, you just gotta say:
What the fudge.

06:15.358 --> 06:17.487
- That's not the line.
- I saw it on a plane.

06:20.368 --> 06:21.818
Can I have one of these babies?

06:22.257 --> 06:24.979
- Why do you call'em babies?
- Don't know, always have.

06:25.302 --> 06:26.496
I like you, Shirley.

06:27.773 --> 06:32.549
You know something? You look just like a
nurse that used to work here, named Laverne.

06:32.877 --> 06:34.126
- Doesn't she?
- No.

06:34.757 --> 06:37.768
Oh yes, she does. I feel like I'm
looking at Laverne again.

06:39.758 --> 06:41.868
You just got yourself
a new nickname, Missy.

06:42.244 --> 06:44.188
See you in a bit, Lavern-again.
Lavernagain!

06:45.683 --> 06:49.114
Baby, you can't just speak spanish
to my little african princess.

06:49.380 --> 06:51.647
She's not your little african princess. She's

06:51.752 --> 06:54.163
our little half african,
half latina princess.

06:54.619 --> 06:55.851
Baby, that's a little weirdy.

06:56.346 --> 06:59.079
<i>Here we go. Carla and Turk are at it again.</i>

06:59.500 --> 07:01.777
My mother taught me how
important my heritage is

07:01.778 --> 07:05.308
I would do the same for Izzie, and
speaking spanish is a huge part of that.

07:05.428 --> 07:08.167
<i>Just a matter of time before
they rope me in.<i></i></i>

07:08.408 --> 07:10.138
Plus, I wanna take to the homeland.

07:10.367 --> 07:11.766
<i>Any second now...<i></i></i>

07:11.977 --> 07:15.064
Baby you're from Chigago.
Just get her a deep-dish pizza.

07:15.359 --> 07:17.918
Know what? Why don't you
get me a deep dish pizza?

07:18.135 --> 07:20.261
With onions and <i>sausage</i> ?

07:20.544 --> 07:21.602
<i>Here it comes.<i></i></i>

07:21.722 --> 07:23.967
Turk, I was referring
to the Dominican Republic,

07:23.968 --> 07:27.729
and if you say: isn't that where I bought my
wrinkle-free cheenos, I'm gonna kill you.

07:27.985 --> 07:29.539
Where are your ancestors from?

07:31.259 --> 07:33.940
- The motherland?
- You don't even know.

07:34.767 --> 07:38.326
<i>And now, a gentle throat clear,
to let them know I'm ready to speak.<i></i></i>

07:38.634 --> 07:39.873
Ah-Uhm!

07:40.639 --> 07:41.923
JD, drink some water.

07:48.465 --> 07:50.994
- Go to hell Bob.
- I didn't even say anything.

07:52.435 --> 07:56.535
There nowher else to sit, so you can drop
the scary stare, doesn't work on me anymore.

07:58.038 --> 08:00.373
Kickin' me under the table's not
gonna make me leave either.

08:00.696 --> 08:02.784
I did it. You talk too much.

08:03.091 --> 08:05.871
Say it Bob. Sorry about that
"Go to hell" thing earlier.

08:05.872 --> 08:06.606
We're cool.

08:06.952 --> 08:10.391
You're just pissy because Jordan
left. I'mean, I'm in the same boat.

08:10.962 --> 08:14.957
Ever since I broke up my engagement I
live all alone in a big empty house.

08:15.227 --> 08:17.901
Hell, Bob here is living at the
hospital beacuse Enid kicked him out.

08:18.021 --> 08:20.634
Did she just call me
Bob? I would kick her again.

08:21.535 --> 08:23.758
We're like the "Lonely hearts' table".

08:23.983 --> 08:27.280
No. No, actually that's
the "Lonely hearts' table".

08:27.490 --> 08:29.758
<i>Who are you?</i>

08:30.667 --> 08:32.236
<i>Who-who! Who-who!</i>

08:32.238 --> 08:36.179
Ok! We'll never win the "A Cappella
Pulitzer" performing like that.

08:36.224 --> 08:40.219
And if we don't win there's no chance
of us getting laid at the after party.

08:40.924 --> 08:44.597
Barbie. P-lease stop
lumping us in together.

08:44.598 --> 08:49.688
Tomorrow is my day off and I'm
joyous to have my place all to myself.

08:49.689 --> 08:52.045
You see, I'm a lot of things.

08:52.046 --> 08:55.994
I'm a scorpio, a registered indipendent,
a foodie, a parrothead, yes I do love

08:55.995 --> 08:58.773
that Jimmy Buffer though he's have,
all his will, a leg man...

08:58.774 --> 09:00.688
- A right bastard.
- Thank you, Bob.

09:00.689 --> 09:03.448
But I can assure you the
one thing I am not is...

09:03.449 --> 09:04.489
Straight?

09:04.781 --> 09:08.100
Audience participation is now
over. The one thing I'm not

09:08.453 --> 09:10.241
is lonely. Capisc'?

09:11.968 --> 09:14.139
Hey. You should know that new nurse

09:14.432 --> 09:16.091
hates the stupid nickname you gave her.

09:16.361 --> 09:18.299
"Lavernagain"? No way!

09:19.673 --> 09:20.574
I hate it.

09:20.950 --> 09:23.336
Well, you might hate
it now, Lavernagain,

09:23.337 --> 09:26.405
but once you've heard it a few
times, you're gonna love it.

09:27.445 --> 09:28.189
Lavernagain.

09:28.595 --> 09:31.471
You're such a man of the people.
D'you even know anybody's real name?

09:31.802 --> 09:32.831
Of course I do.

09:35.887 --> 09:39.927
- Why the people keep hiding behind you?
- Challenge. What's the real name?

09:41.308 --> 09:43.103
Well, she never told me her real name.

09:43.612 --> 09:44.776
I like Lavernagain.

09:46.375 --> 09:48.809
And, Snoop I... I'd hoped you'd really

09:48.810 --> 09:51.752
change your name, that's... That's
never again around of that? Okay.

09:52.383 --> 09:55.447
Ah. Colonel I have to pass on you.

09:56.558 --> 10:00.317
<i>Okay. You can get this one. I know it's
just like Beardface but not Beardface.</i>

10:00.318 --> 10:02.123
<i>What is it? Oh, right!</i>

10:02.385 --> 10:03.129
Beardmouth.

10:03.392 --> 10:05.780
<i>It's Beardface', damn it!</i>

10:06.757 --> 10:09.325
Man of the people indeed.

10:10.661 --> 10:13.665
<i>It's always surprising to learn
how people close to you really feel.</i>

10:14.806 --> 10:17.352
How can you know nothing
about your own background?

10:17.487 --> 10:20.671
Baby, what do you want me to say?
It just doesn't mean that much to me.

10:23.027 --> 10:26.187
<i>Still the only person's feelings you
can truly hope to know are your own.</i>

10:26.867 --> 10:30.513
<i>Daddy, mommy says you
once peed in the garden.</i>

10:30.538 --> 10:31.349
Guilty!

10:31.582 --> 10:33.883
<i>Hey Perry. This isn't "come in to me" coin.</i>

10:34.033 --> 10:34.911
It does so?

10:34.912 --> 10:37.272
<i>Cause I made your dial and
you and I din't speak.</i>

10:38.426 --> 10:41.856
<i>I just want to tell you I've decided
to stay here for the week. Bye!</i>

10:42.943 --> 10:45.358
<i>Of course, sometimes a phone
call changes everything.</i>

10:48.327 --> 10:51.090
<i>The obvious way to beat loneliness
is with the company of others.</i>

10:51.349 --> 10:54.575
Hey Tedsky! Can I... Can
I maybe help you, here?

10:54.576 --> 10:56.077
- Really?
- That's really a lot of files.

10:56.078 --> 10:57.675
- Thanks!
- No problemo. Oh.

10:57.867 --> 11:01.279
<i>It only gets complicated if you don't
want others to see that you're vulnerable.</i>

11:01.634 --> 11:03.917
So, I've heard Jordan's
staying away the whole week down?

11:03.918 --> 11:04.909
Uh...

11:05.202 --> 11:08.584
Yeah, we're being texting each other a lot
since we both find out we're nervous pooers.

11:09.011 --> 11:11.240
I turned her on to one
soundproofer so talented,

11:11.462 --> 11:14.009
even someone with the ear to your
door, can't hear when you fluffy.

11:14.262 --> 11:15.023
Interesting.

11:15.024 --> 11:18.280
Tell you what. When she gets back you two
other think about having a crazy off.

11:19.583 --> 11:20.827
I'm gonna text her that you said that.

11:24.972 --> 11:27.387
Goodness Gracious Ted, I'm-
I'm sure sorry about that.

11:27.825 --> 11:30.396
It's okay, I'm used to it.

11:31.754 --> 11:35.112
Say Ted... These... These are all
just blank pieces of white paper?

11:35.707 --> 11:37.383
Shhhhh!

11:38.266 --> 11:39.714
I need to look busy!

11:43.049 --> 11:45.121
Hello, tall, dark and...

11:45.675 --> 11:46.414
whatever?

11:46.696 --> 11:47.952
- Handsome.
- No

11:48.468 --> 11:52.079
Well done, "Dr. John I think I am a man
of the people but now thanks to the janitor

11:52.080 --> 11:54.945
everyone knows I'm a fraud now
I have egg on my face Dorian".

11:55.473 --> 11:56.969
That's your clever new nickname!

11:57.473 --> 11:59.798
<i>Oh my God! You finally have a nickname!</i>

12:00.717 --> 12:03.883
I can admit when I'm
wrong, so... Challenge!

12:04.328 --> 12:07.638
I will learn everyone in the
hospital's real name, by the end of the day.

12:07.920 --> 12:10.822
You are gonna learn 310 names in one day.

12:10.900 --> 12:14.522
Hey, the night before my anatomy final
I got drunk of peppermint shnapps,

12:14.523 --> 12:17.604
'cause Turk told me it was a special
new mouthwash, could swallow.

12:18.067 --> 12:22.176
And after I was done crying and dry
heaving and lying in a fetal position,

12:22.177 --> 12:26.364
I still managed to memorize
all 216 bones in the human body.

12:27.006 --> 12:29.235
There's only 206 bones in the human body.

12:29.769 --> 12:31.962
Well, it appears I learned
ten more than I needed to.

12:32.429 --> 12:36.471
So, how about a little wager?
If I win, you have to do my job for a day.

12:36.798 --> 12:37.850
And if I win?

12:37.998 --> 12:39.881
I'll do my job for a day.

12:40.186 --> 12:41.234
How's that fair?

12:41.567 --> 12:43.064
I'll actually do my job for a day!

12:43.274 --> 12:45.581
Ohh! Deal!

12:46.100 --> 12:47.081
D'ya know how?

12:47.479 --> 12:49.929
It's been a while... I can do it.

12:53.545 --> 12:55.966
Well... You look like
you could use some help.

12:56.399 --> 12:58.526
I'm ok. Actually,
I'm just looking for Carla.

13:00.053 --> 13:02.645
Anyone need any... help?

13:04.072 --> 13:05.560
Me! I need help!

13:07.738 --> 13:09.066
You get the hell out of the way.

13:09.960 --> 13:11.438
Hi. Help.

13:14.556 --> 13:18.750
Ok, Dr. John - I think I'm a man of
the people, but now, thanks to the janitor,

13:18.751 --> 13:21.819
everybody knows I'm a fraud
and I've egg on my face - Dorian.

13:21.897 --> 13:22.829
Very funny.

13:22.969 --> 13:26.185
<i>Perfect. Pretend you hate
that nick name so it'll stick.</i>

13:26.715 --> 13:31.424
- Who is this?
- He is a doctor... I think it's Patrick or Paul...

13:31.508 --> 13:34.837
It's Gwen. Although she does have
a mean case of men face.

13:35.678 --> 13:39.919
Dr Cox, I just wantna throw this out there,
it feels good to be your student again.

13:40.508 --> 13:44.346
Take that back, or I'm going to shelve
everyone of these polaroids down your throat.

13:44.694 --> 13:46.334
<i>Back to best friends it is.</i>

13:46.959 --> 13:49.909
You know what you should use?
Mnemonic devices.

13:50.121 --> 13:54.782
Associate the person's name with
something about them. I do it all of the time.

13:54.805 --> 13:58.352
Like... this guy.
Look... at him.

13:58.364 --> 14:01.020
Now, There's no way he's ever
going to make love to a woman,

14:01.043 --> 14:05.546
unless that woman is dead.
And "dead" rhymes with "Ted".

14:06.490 --> 14:07.445
Ted.

14:07.781 --> 14:09.577
That's how most people remember it.

14:12.197 --> 14:14.365
And what were your mnemonic
device for remembering my name?

14:14.617 --> 14:15.632
Do you really wanna know?

14:15.728 --> 14:16.918
- Do i?
- No.

14:18.125 --> 14:18.864
I knew it.

14:19.042 --> 14:21.019
Look at how much
you don't want to be alone.

14:21.020 --> 14:24.165
You're actually open at the guy who
you claim annoys you the most.

14:24.379 --> 14:28.272
Elliot it's been 7 years. I think we
all know I don't annoy him.

14:30.104 --> 14:32.295
<i>Ok, you're in it, now.
Go for broke.</i>

14:32.900 --> 14:37.403
Heck, I bet that Perry would admit that
I'm not just a collegue, I'm a friend.

14:38.821 --> 14:41.068
<i>And arm around him...</i>

14:43.898 --> 14:46.619
<i>Oh, my God!
Is this what heaven's like?</i>

14:47.052 --> 14:51.209
Yep. Just... helping out a friend. There is
nothing to do with me being lonely.

14:52.999 --> 14:55.005
Hey, wait a second.
Isn't today your day-off?

14:59.241 --> 15:02.249
Hey, baby. You know somehing?
You're absolutely right.

15:02.250 --> 15:05.045
I do need to learn more about my
heritee, so I called my mom,

15:05.326 --> 15:10.132
and she said somehow, distantly, I'm
releated to the guy who invented peanuts.

15:10.402 --> 15:12.082
Turk, that's George Washington Carver.

15:12.105 --> 15:15.717
He didn't invent peanuts,
he just thought up uses for them.

15:15.798 --> 15:20.201
I'm talking about the little phone packaging
peanuts. How dumb do you think I am?

15:21.553 --> 15:22.356
Baby!

15:22.566 --> 15:25.882
You... just don't get what's
really bothering me so...

15:26.333 --> 15:27.979
A couple of days ago you dreamed in english.

15:29.447 --> 15:31.451
Three years of marriage and
I'm starting to pay attention.

15:32.119 --> 15:35.651
I feel like I'm losing all connections
to who makes me me, you know?

15:36.102 --> 15:39.274
My best friend is a very very
white girl from Connecticut.

15:39.845 --> 15:41.966
If who I am keeps slipping away from me,

15:41.967 --> 15:44.226
how would I ever be able
to pass it on to Izzie?

15:44.682 --> 15:46.683
It's bad enough then when
people look at my doughter,

15:46.684 --> 15:49.013
they only see your little african princess.

15:49.127 --> 15:51.386
They think she's black,
not half black and half latina.

15:51.600 --> 15:55.326
- That's not true.
- Oh, really? Watch. Sir?

15:55.850 --> 15:57.682
What race would you say this baby is?

15:58.085 --> 16:03.545
Oh... Half black, half latina...
most likely dominican origin...

16:03.780 --> 16:06.147
Than again, I am the new hospital geneticist.

16:07.907 --> 16:09.445
That's just bad luck, baby.

16:10.448 --> 16:11.553
Oh my God.

16:11.746 --> 16:12.791
What the hell is wrong with me?

16:13.440 --> 16:15.393
I used to be an Idle.
I didn't need anybody.

16:15.463 --> 16:18.469
Now I can't function for a week,
without Jordan and the kids.

16:19.039 --> 16:23.383
Well, luckily, you have a lot of very close
special friends to help you through this.

16:23.593 --> 16:25.197
- JD, stop it.
- No, you stop it!

16:26.267 --> 16:27.947
I'm sorry you had to see me like that.

16:28.063 --> 16:32.075
Mostly, God, I... I feel like
I'm losing track of my identity.

16:32.580 --> 16:36.239
<i>And just like that, a lot of people found
themselves asking the same question:</i>

16:37.027 --> 16:38.649
This one's for the ladies.

16:41.375 --> 16:43.460
* Who are you? *

16:44.284 --> 16:45.839
* Who who? Who who? *

16:45.875 --> 16:47.738
* I really wanna know *

16:47.739 --> 16:49.258
* Who are you? *

16:49.919 --> 16:50.736
Who am I?

16:53.056 --> 16:54.432
* Who are you?! *

16:54.690 --> 16:55.627
Who am I?

16:56.134 --> 16:58.793
* Who... are you... You! *
* Are you... who the fudge are.. *

16:59.184 --> 17:00.097
Who the hell is that?

17:00.427 --> 17:02.827
It's Skip, the gynecologist.
Are you honestly whining

17:02.828 --> 17:04.832
because you feel attached
to your wife and kids?

17:05.310 --> 17:06.555
I like the way I was.

17:06.741 --> 17:08.172
Uh, you've been a giant jackass

17:08.173 --> 17:10.382
that nobody can stand to be
around for more than 20 seconds.

17:10.550 --> 17:12.334
- Yes, I love that guy.
- Me too.

17:12.676 --> 17:14.497
Well, guess what... you're still him.

17:14.521 --> 17:17.554
Only, now when you go home there's actually
people there that are happy to see you.

17:18.011 --> 17:19.537
Probably 'cause they don't know any better.

17:24.510 --> 17:26.661
- That won't end well for you.
- Ok...

17:28.631 --> 17:29.208
Buddy.

17:32.361 --> 17:33.743
What is so funny?

17:35.461 --> 17:39.774
I just think it's hilarious that you think
you can stop being a proud lat woman.

17:40.620 --> 17:42.675
Baby, all your ringtones are bachata music.

17:43.402 --> 17:45.942
You're the only nurse in this hospital
who demands that any doctor

17:45.943 --> 17:48.454
who wants a big favor
has to ask you in spanish.

17:48.455 --> 17:50.635
Si, es lo mas mulesto.

17:52.138 --> 17:55.958
So we got a daughter, and our life is moving
out to really really fast pace, but baby...

17:57.189 --> 18:00.758
You're always gonna be a latina with
an outside-down exclamation point.

18:01.425 --> 18:02.260
You promise?

18:06.465 --> 18:08.141
Mas... mas.

18:08.802 --> 18:11.241
Aaand... action.

18:12.455 --> 18:13.104
All right.

18:13.663 --> 18:15.578
He looks like a serial killer,

18:15.579 --> 18:19.508
which is a kind of cereal i'd want
to stay away from, like "All Bran".

18:20.115 --> 18:22.386
- Brandon.
- Hmm. Correct.

18:23.701 --> 18:25.570
Ok, Snoop Dogg Attending.

18:25.894 --> 18:30.436
I saw him without his pants on, and he has crazy skinny legs, like french fries

18:30.688 --> 18:35.194
French fries are sold at McDonald's, whose
founder is Ronald McDonald... Ronald.

18:36.072 --> 18:38.066
You saw him without his pant on, Wats?

18:39.219 --> 18:41.646
That's popcorn magnate Orville Reddenbacher.

18:41.647 --> 18:42.169
Yes.

18:42.740 --> 18:45.534
<i>We all wanto to be appreciated
for our unique identities.</i>

18:46.238 --> 18:48.896
¿Matarme? Elliot no te lo permitira'.

18:49.342 --> 18:53.692
Seguro que lo hare. Turk me deja criar a Izzy. Finalmente tendre' un bebe'.

18:53.848 --> 18:55.881
Y puedo passar el resto de mi vida con el Turk,

18:55.882 --> 19:00.078
corriendo todos los melhoras
waterparks del mondo. ¡Liste, Elliot!

19:02.816 --> 19:04.220
<i> MATA CARLA</i>

19:04.221 --> 19:05.863
¡Despejate!

19:06.415 --> 19:08.069
Naaaaaaaaah!

19:10.337 --> 19:11.496
Bad dream, baby?

19:12.712 --> 19:13.389
No...

19:14.273 --> 19:15.643
It was a great dream.

19:17.112 --> 19:18.613
What are you listening to?

19:19.130 --> 19:22.641
Some boring medical lecture...
go back to sleep.

19:23.251 --> 19:26.413
<i>But bone we decide to change who we
are, for someone we love...</i>

19:27.028 --> 19:29.143
<i>Cuando es? - What time is it?</i>

19:29.330 --> 19:30.662
<i>Cuando es...</i>

19:31.065 --> 19:33.963
<i>we can surprise even ourselves
with who we've become.</i>

19:34.271 --> 19:35.371
Right, Jordan, you win.

19:36.852 --> 19:38.031
I miss you guys.

19:38.032 --> 19:40.850
<i>I miss you too, daddy.</i>

19:42.229 --> 19:44.930
Jordan, wold you... like
to say the same thing?

19:45.805 --> 19:47.715
<i>- I would not.
- She would not.</i>

19:48.247 --> 19:50.597
<i>We'll call you tomorrow... will we?</i>

19:50.598 --> 19:51.765
<i>- No.
- No.</i>

19:56.287 --> 19:58.179
Colonel Doctor. I call him that

19:58.180 --> 20:01.030
because he looks like a freaky
Kentucky Fried Chicken guy.

20:01.221 --> 20:03.421
KFC makes Cole Slaw...

20:04.035 --> 20:05.390
Colman Slosky.

20:05.640 --> 20:07.520
Incidentally my favourite name ever.

20:07.976 --> 20:10.610
That's correct, but you also lost the bet.

20:11.248 --> 20:12.998
- What are you talking about? I won.
- No.

20:14.579 --> 20:15.353
Aah.

20:15.929 --> 20:19.298
- That's not fair, nobody knows your name.
- Ha ha! You know what that means?

20:22.422 --> 20:25.199
- Aye. You win.
- Yep. And you know what that means?

20:26.627 --> 20:30.381
It's like this ammonia is... sipping
into my brain, and making me

20:30.382 --> 20:32.936
violent, and angry, and hateful.

20:32.955 --> 20:34.413
Yep. That's how it starts.

20:34.727 --> 20:36.918
- What the hell are you looking at?
- Nice...

20:37.015 --> 20:37.798
Good.
