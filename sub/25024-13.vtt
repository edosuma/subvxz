01:04.647 --> 01:07.108
Ha! I trained him.

01:09.235 --> 01:11.738
Not as easy as last time, is it?

01:12.989 --> 01:15.492
[Angor Rot] You've made
some improvements, I see.

01:15.700 --> 01:17.619
Stronger, faster.

Ones who couldn't make it
are hiding at school.

01:38.181 --> 01:39.390
[Toby] Why's the eclipse here?

01:39.474 --> 01:41.601
Wasn't Merlin supposed to have
his magic back?

Where is that stupid wizard?

01:43.520 --> 01:46.022
-[blasts popping]
-Ugh! [gasps]

01:54.405 --> 01:56.950
You might've stolen my magic, Morgana,

01:57.033 --> 02:00.245
but there are still a few tricks left
in these old bones.

All right, kiddies,

Go!

02:55.925 --> 02:58.511
-Eh...?
-[chattering]

02:59.053 --> 03:01.347
Oh, I'm doing it wrong, eh?

03:01.431 --> 03:03.892
-What's your bright idea?

So happy. I told you that would work.

03:22.410 --> 03:23.620
Hah! Whoa!

03:26.039 --> 03:28.833

now you share our skin.

05:00.425 --> 05:03.928
-But inside, you will bleed red!

Gunmar's war is at an end.

07:51.429 --> 07:55.057
And you, my dear boy, have ended it.

07:55.600 --> 07:59.770

[laughter echoes]

08:09.739 --> 08:12.158
-[Blinky] But Merlin's plan...
-Not work.

08:12.575 --> 08:13.451
[Blinky] Indeed.

08:14.869 --> 08:19.415
Don't despair, weak ones.
Your lives will soon be over.

08:19.499 --> 08:22.960
She's beautiful. But totally evil.

08:23.336 --> 08:25.421
Yeah, yeah, we have to stop her.

08:25.505 --> 08:27.131
Without Merlin, how can we?

08:29.217 --> 08:30.968
[Morgana] Merlin's champion.

08:31.052 --> 08:35.014

09:27.942 --> 09:30.653
Jeez, lady. What did I ever do to you?

09:30.736 --> 09:34.740
Merlin never told you what he used
to craft your Amulet, did he?

09:34.824 --> 09:36.325
He took my left hand!

09:46.085 --> 09:48.170
-What?
-He said, "Gotcha!"

09:48.254 --> 09:49.797
It's a colloquialism

09:49.880 --> 09:53.259
and a contraction, you vile troglodyte.

Oh, no.

Claire!

14:20.609 --> 14:22.027
[groaning]

14:25.406 --> 14:27.324
[yelling] Give me your hand!

14:34.915 --> 14:35.791
Toby!

14:37.293 --> 14:38.836
Destroy the Staff!

14:43.591 --> 14:46.093
-Wingman!
-Right behind you!

14:46.802 --> 14:48.637
[Toby yells] My turn!

14:50.764 --> 14:51.599
Uh!

14:54.476 --> 14:56.228
[howling]

14:57.313 --> 14:58.480

[screaming]

15:05.529 --> 15:06.530
[Toby gasps]

15:10.326 --> 15:13.370
Morgana's magic has finally been defeated.

15:13.454 --> 15:15.247
-Thanks to you, Claire.
-Yeah.

15:15.915 --> 15:17.708
No. Thanks to all of us.

15:18.834 --> 15:21.253

[Claire gasps]

15:25.633 --> 15:26.592
Jim.

15:29.553 --> 15:31.221
Stay with me, stay with me.

15:32.097 --> 15:33.057
Stay with me.

15:34.224 --> 15:35.935
[sighs] Jim.

15:36.018 --> 15:37.394
[sobs]

15:38.562 --> 15:39.772
[Aaarrrgghh!!!] Jim?

[gasps]

15:42.942 --> 15:43.776
[Claire sobs]

15:45.361 --> 15:49.907
"I shall be much in years
before I again behold my Romeo."

15:49.990 --> 15:52.076
[sniffles] "Oh...

15:52.868 --> 15:55.454
Thinkest thou we shall ever meet again?"

15:55.704 --> 15:56.914
[sighs]

15:57.623 --> 16:00.334
-[Claire] "I doubt it not."
-[sighs]

16:00.542 --> 16:04.588
"And all these woes
shall serve for sweet discourses

16:05.255 --> 16:06.715
in our times to come."

16:07.216 --> 16:08.926
[gasps]

16:09.551 --> 16:10.469
[sobs]

16:15.766 --> 16:17.476
-[Jim] Hey...
-[gasps]

16:17.559 --> 16:18.769
The last line.

16:19.770 --> 16:21.397
-That was mine.
-[chuckles]

16:21.480 --> 16:22.648
-Ah! Jim!
-Whoo!

16:22.731 --> 16:23.732
Oh, Jim!

16:23.816 --> 16:25.234
Jim! [laughs]

16:25.317 --> 16:26.568
[laughing]

16:26.652 --> 16:28.988
Jim! Awesome-sauce!

16:33.242 --> 16:34.284
[yelling]

16:34.368 --> 16:36.787
[chanting]

16:41.000 --> 16:43.043
Oh, now he shows up.

16:54.304 --> 16:56.390
[sighing, grunting]

16:57.891 --> 17:01.729
Hey, hey, hey.
Hey, everybody, lighten up, buttsnacks.

17:01.812 --> 17:06.108
-They're our friends.
-You hear that? Steve and I are friends.

17:06.191 --> 17:07.734
-[yelps]
-[laughs]

17:07.818 --> 17:09.528
-[grunts, laughs]
-[moans] Oh...!

17:09.611 --> 17:10.779
-[troll] Friend!
-[gasps]

17:10.863 --> 17:11.780
[child laughs]

17:16.367 --> 17:20.455
[gasps] Remarkable. Thank you.

17:20.539 --> 17:24.042
[laughing] Ooh! Remarkable.

17:24.626 --> 17:28.088
[giggles]
Well, I do use a leave-in conditioner.

17:28.172 --> 17:29.214
[Ms. Janeth chuckles]

17:29.465 --> 17:31.091
-[all gasp]
-[troll groans]

17:31.175 --> 17:32.259
Come with me.

17:32.342 --> 17:33.886
Let's find some shade.

17:38.390 --> 17:41.602
You have made me proud, Champion.

17:45.522 --> 17:48.108
I am forever in your service.

17:49.193 --> 17:50.027
[Jim grunts]

17:51.862 --> 17:56.158
The Eternal Night is finally over.

17:57.576 --> 18:00.329
Heartstone gone.

18:01.371 --> 18:02.831
[Blinky]  In Deya's name.

18:04.583 --> 18:08.921
Then we'll need to find
a new Heartstone... out there.

18:09.004 --> 18:11.590
I've heard tell of a Heartstone

18:11.673 --> 18:15.677
in a place called New Jersey.

18:16.136 --> 18:19.431
We'll make preparations
and gather what we can from Trollmarket.

18:20.224 --> 18:21.475
We'll leave at nightfall.

18:32.444 --> 18:34.571
-[sighs]
-[bird squawks]

18:36.240 --> 18:37.449
[faint clanking]

18:42.246 --> 18:43.205
[Barbara sighs]

18:44.873 --> 18:47.626
I promised I'd never leave you.

18:47.709 --> 18:48.544
Honey...

18:49.503 --> 18:51.713
I knew this day would come. I just...

18:53.298 --> 18:54.466
never knew when.

18:55.259 --> 18:57.761
[Barbara] I hope you find
what you're looking for.

18:58.262 --> 18:59.555
[Barbara sobs]

18:59.638 --> 19:01.265
Just call often.

19:01.807 --> 19:05.310
Every day. Twice. Text. Now and then?

19:06.478 --> 19:08.605
Of course, Mom. I love you.

19:09.064 --> 19:09.898
[chuckles]

19:10.566 --> 19:12.484
Not more than I love you, kiddo.

19:13.652 --> 19:15.445
Are you ready, Master Jim?

19:16.738 --> 19:18.157
Ready as I'll ever be.

19:18.740 --> 19:20.909
I don't know what tomorrow brings,

19:21.285 --> 19:24.955
but with our Trollhunter by our side,
I don't fear it either.

19:26.081 --> 19:28.417
I really appreciate that, Mr. Blinky.

19:28.500 --> 19:29.376
[Jim gasps]

19:34.381 --> 19:37.843
-Claire, I can't ask you to--
-You didn't ask.

19:39.052 --> 19:40.137
[gasps]

19:40.220 --> 19:42.639
She has enough credits to graduate early.

19:43.182 --> 19:45.267
We're treating this like some time abroad.

19:45.934 --> 19:48.353
As long as she comes back soon.

19:48.937 --> 19:49.771
[laughing]

19:55.652 --> 19:58.280
Good luck, Young Atlas.

19:59.573 --> 20:00.407
[sighs]

20:09.666 --> 20:11.710
You did good raising him, Doc.

20:11.835 --> 20:15.088
-Here's a thousand new babies to raise.
-What?

20:15.172 --> 20:17.925
-Have fun with that, you two.
-Wait!

20:18.008 --> 20:21.136
Wait! Wait for me!

20:21.220 --> 20:23.388
[gasps] Whew!

20:23.764 --> 20:26.183
Boy, these goodbyes are tough, you know.

20:26.266 --> 20:28.435
Nana wanted me to take Mr. Meow Meow P.I.,

20:28.518 --> 20:31.396
but he does not travel well. [chuckles]

20:32.856 --> 20:33.690
What?

20:34.316 --> 20:36.151
[sighs] Tobes...

20:37.236 --> 20:38.612
you have to stay.

20:39.488 --> 20:40.322
What?

20:40.656 --> 20:43.450
You're going on a quest. I love quests.

20:43.533 --> 20:45.035
We go everywhere together.

20:45.702 --> 20:48.789
I'm hurt. Claire lost her Shadow Staff.

20:49.581 --> 20:52.000
You are the only one

20:52.084 --> 20:53.877
who can protect Arcadia.

20:53.961 --> 20:55.837
No, Wingman.

20:56.296 --> 20:59.466
I help. I stay.

20:59.591 --> 21:00.592
[gasps]

21:05.389 --> 21:08.058
So, you're staying with me...

21:09.101 --> 21:11.395
and you're leaving?

21:11.937 --> 21:14.815
But we'll be back. Someday.

21:15.607 --> 21:16.441
[sniffles]

21:17.442 --> 21:19.111
You better. [sniffles]

21:19.194 --> 21:23.115
-And then, we'll get tacos.
-[chuckles] And enchiladas.

21:23.198 --> 21:24.491
-[Jim chuckles]
-[Toby sobs]

21:24.908 --> 21:28.203
We sure found that adventure.
Right, Tobes?

21:28.954 --> 21:31.206
I'm really glad
we took the canal that morning.

21:33.041 --> 21:34.459
Keep Arcadia safe.

21:34.543 --> 21:36.628
You're its only Trollhunters now.

21:37.713 --> 21:39.506
I still don't like you.

21:42.134 --> 21:43.135
I know.

21:51.268 --> 21:52.352
[chattering]

21:56.023 --> 22:00.110
I believe this belongs to you,
Trollhunter.

22:03.155 --> 22:04.072
[rings]

22:08.285 --> 22:11.872
[Jim]  Destiny is... a gift.

22:12.914 --> 22:15.667
Never forget that fear

22:15.751 --> 22:18.920
is but the precursor to valor.

22:19.004 --> 22:21.590
That to strive and triumph

22:21.673 --> 22:24.176
- in the face of fear...
-[rings]

22:24.259 --> 22:28.263
is what it means to be a hero.

22:28.805 --> 22:29.890
Don't think.

22:31.683 --> 22:32.768
Become.
