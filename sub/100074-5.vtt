00:00.100 --> 00:01.790
- Previously,
on "God Friended Me"...

00:01.790 --> 00:03.060
- Your last article is trending

00:03.060 --> 00:04.660
at the top
of the "Catapult" leaderboard.

00:04.660 --> 00:06.170
- So any news on the job hunt?
- Not yet.

00:06.970 --> 00:08.630
- Why do you not work in IT?

00:08.630 --> 00:11.070
It is a technology company,
is it not?

00:11.070 --> 00:13.840
- Yes, um, I don't have
my bachelor's degree.

00:15.240 --> 00:17.780
- We just got word
from the diocese.

00:17.780 --> 00:20.550
Unfortunately, they're going
with Reverend Thompson.

00:20.550 --> 00:22.510
- Bishop Thompson,
what a pleasant surprise.

00:22.510 --> 00:24.050
- I've been looking
for a chief of staff.

00:24.050 --> 00:25.250
What do you say?

00:25.250 --> 00:26.680
- I was just hoping

00:26.680 --> 00:28.790
that this next chapter
of our lives

00:28.790 --> 00:31.020
was gonna be about us together.

00:31.020 --> 00:32.490
- Now that Joy's gone,

00:32.490 --> 00:34.560
maybe that's the last we hear
from the God Account.

00:34.560 --> 00:36.690
- Just got
a new Friend Suggestion.

00:36.690 --> 00:39.560
- ♪ Ooh ♪

00:44.940 --> 00:47.410
- ♪ Baby, I know love ♪

00:47.410 --> 00:49.310
- ♪ Isn't what I thought
it was ♪

00:49.310 --> 00:53.180
- Miles, slow--slow down!

00:53.180 --> 00:55.450
Seriously.

00:55.450 --> 00:56.980
Look, I never thought
I would be the one

00:56.980 --> 00:57.980
catching up to you.

00:57.980 --> 00:58.650
- What can I say?

00:58.650 --> 01:00.150
I'm in a good mood--

01:00.150 --> 01:01.850
especially because we have
our Friend Suggestions back.

01:01.850 --> 01:03.520
- Yeah, speaking of which,
did Rakesh find out anything

01:03.520 --> 01:04.720
about Claire Thompson?

01:04.720 --> 01:05.820
- Not yet.

01:05.820 --> 01:07.390
Her Facebook page is private,
but he said,

01:07.390 --> 01:09.430
"I will have it
hacked by 10:00 a.m."

01:09.430 --> 01:11.030
So it sounds like everything
is going back

01:11.030 --> 01:12.460
to the way that it should be.

01:12.460 --> 01:14.270
- Actually,
you're right about that.

01:14.270 --> 01:16.370
My old boss, Natalie,

01:16.370 --> 01:17.500
got promoted
to editor in chief.

01:17.500 --> 01:18.900
She called this morning

01:18.900 --> 01:20.640
and offered me my job
in features back.

01:20.640 --> 01:21.840
- Congratulations.
That's incredible.

01:21.840 --> 01:22.940
- Thank you.

01:22.940 --> 01:24.210
I came back from Paris
to write stories

01:24.210 --> 01:25.680
that were personal to me.

01:25.680 --> 01:28.080
This just feels right...

01:28.080 --> 01:30.420
and so does this.

01:30.420 --> 01:32.280
I'm glad we finally have time
for us.

01:32.280 --> 01:34.720
- I agree, which is why

01:34.720 --> 01:37.060
I made dinner reservations
for us tonight.

01:37.060 --> 01:38.420
- You did?
- Uh-huh.

01:38.420 --> 01:40.590
8:00 p.m. at Momofuku.

01:40.590 --> 01:42.330
- Sounds great.

01:48.230 --> 01:49.500
- Oh, it's Rakesh.

01:49.500 --> 01:52.340
He got access
to Claire's Facebook page.

01:52.340 --> 01:55.310
- Wait, what is it?

01:55.310 --> 01:57.640
- Do you remember
Reverend Thompson,

01:57.640 --> 01:59.280
the guy who beat my dad
in the election

01:59.280 --> 02:00.610
to become bishop
of New York?

02:00.610 --> 02:02.580
- Yeah, what about him?

02:02.580 --> 02:05.050
- Claire Thompson
is his daughter.

02:08.290 --> 02:10.490
- Not much on her Facebook.

02:10.490 --> 02:13.960
Says she's a registered nurse,
but doesn't say where.

02:13.960 --> 02:15.430
- Wait, you said that
Bishop Thompson

02:15.430 --> 02:17.060
and your dad
were friends, right?

02:17.060 --> 02:18.430
- Yeah, I can give him a call,

02:18.430 --> 02:19.760
see if he can
introduce us to Claire.

02:19.760 --> 02:20.900
- No need.

02:20.900 --> 02:22.570
According to
the church's website,

02:22.570 --> 02:24.300
the bishop and his family
are hosting a celebration

02:24.300 --> 02:25.370
of the new ministry today.

02:25.370 --> 02:26.570
- Well, then, we should

02:26.570 --> 02:27.770
congratulate the bishop
on his win.

02:27.770 --> 02:28.970
- We should.

02:28.970 --> 02:30.510
- You guys are gonna
have to survive without me.

02:30.510 --> 02:32.780
I got a romantic lunch date
with Jaya.

02:32.780 --> 02:35.050
- Nice, where you going?
- Hospital cafeteria.

02:36.610 --> 02:38.720
Okay, it isn't
romantic-romantic,

02:38.720 --> 02:41.220
but Jaya's doing a rotation
at New York General,

02:41.220 --> 02:42.490
and it's keeping her
pretty busy,

02:42.490 --> 02:44.190
so gotta improvise.

02:46.260 --> 02:47.960
- Make sure
to talk to Reverend Martinez

02:47.960 --> 02:50.600
about the divinity
scholarship programs.

02:50.600 --> 02:52.930
- He agreed to come?
- Well, not at first.

02:54.430 --> 02:56.530
- You really are
a miracle worker.

02:56.530 --> 02:59.040
So how'd Trish feel
about this trial run

02:59.040 --> 03:00.510
as chief of staff?

03:00.510 --> 03:02.540
- I haven't told her
about it yet.

03:02.540 --> 03:05.440
Um, I want to be certain
that I can make this work

03:05.440 --> 03:07.280
before I let my family know.

03:07.280 --> 03:10.680
- Understood,
but we can make it work.

03:10.680 --> 03:12.750
I promise.

03:12.750 --> 03:15.020
- Excuse me.

03:15.020 --> 03:17.790
- Miles, Cara.

03:17.790 --> 03:19.760
- So good to see you.

03:19.760 --> 03:21.390
- Welcome home.
- Thank you.

03:21.390 --> 03:22.930
- Dad, what are you doing here?

03:22.930 --> 03:25.700
- Oh, um, Bishop Thompson
asked me to come by

03:25.700 --> 03:27.430
and help with introductions,

03:27.430 --> 03:29.870
ease his transition
as bishop of New York.

03:29.870 --> 03:32.270
But the more important question
is, what are you doing here?

03:32.270 --> 03:35.470
- Actually, we're here to talk
to his daughter, Claire.

03:35.470 --> 03:36.710
- Why, what's going on?

03:36.710 --> 03:39.380
- She's my Friend Suggestion.

03:39.380 --> 03:41.180
After Joy went back
to Chicago,

03:41.180 --> 03:45.080
I started getting them again,
and she's the first one back.

03:45.080 --> 03:46.950
- Is there anything
you can tell us about her?

03:46.950 --> 03:48.920
- I've known Claire
since she was little.

03:48.920 --> 03:50.290
Um, as far as I know,

03:50.290 --> 03:53.320
she's doing really well.

03:53.320 --> 03:55.290
- Wait, what do you mean,

03:55.290 --> 03:57.830
"doing really well?"

03:57.830 --> 03:58.930
Come on, Dad.

03:58.930 --> 04:01.430
Dad, you know
we're here to help.

04:01.430 --> 04:03.330
- She's in recovery.

04:03.330 --> 04:05.500
Two years sober.

04:05.500 --> 04:07.210
- But if the God Account
sent me her name,

04:07.210 --> 04:08.670
maybe something's happened.

04:08.670 --> 04:10.540
- For Claire's sake,
I hope not,

04:10.540 --> 04:12.840
but I'll introduce you.

04:12.840 --> 04:14.580
Claire, a minute?

04:16.150 --> 04:17.920
- Hey.

04:21.390 --> 04:22.890
- This is my son Miles
and his girlfriend, Cara.

04:22.890 --> 04:24.090
- Hey...
both: Nice to meet you.

04:24.090 --> 04:25.590
- You, too.

04:25.590 --> 04:26.890
- Hey, congratulations
on your dad becoming bishop.

04:26.890 --> 04:27.990
- Oh, thank you.

04:27.990 --> 04:30.630
- Um, excuse me.

04:30.630 --> 04:32.630
- So you must have to attend
a lot of these events.

04:32.630 --> 04:34.800
- Yeah, my dad
likes to remind everyone

04:34.800 --> 04:37.300
that he is a family man
as well as a bishop.

04:37.300 --> 04:39.740
- Well, I know what it's like,
growing up as a pastor's kid.

04:39.740 --> 04:41.570
Sometimes they set the bar high

04:41.570 --> 04:43.240
and it's tough when you're not
able to reach it.

04:43.240 --> 04:46.940
- And when you don't,
they won't let you forget it.

04:46.940 --> 04:49.880
Sorry, that sounded
kind of terrible.

04:49.880 --> 04:51.950
I love my dad.

04:51.950 --> 04:53.720
My parents got divorced
when I was four,

04:53.720 --> 04:56.790
and, well, we've been together
ever since.

04:56.790 --> 04:59.560
The relationship's
just a bit complicated.

04:59.560 --> 05:01.360
- Wanna talk about complicated?

05:01.360 --> 05:02.960
I'm an atheist.

05:02.960 --> 05:04.830
- Okay, um, I admit

05:04.830 --> 05:07.330
that's missing the bar
pretty spectacularly.

05:11.300 --> 05:13.540
- Is everything okay?

05:13.540 --> 05:15.410
- Yeah, it's just a friend.

05:15.410 --> 05:18.440
Um, I'm gonna have to go, so...

05:18.440 --> 05:19.540
- Miles, you remember
Bishop Thompson.

05:19.540 --> 05:20.950
- Oh, of course, of course.

05:20.950 --> 05:22.150
It's good to see you again.
- You, too.

05:22.150 --> 05:24.080
- Um, Dad, sorry to cut out,

05:24.080 --> 05:25.750
but, uh, I have to go to work.

05:25.750 --> 05:28.090
- I thought
you had the day off?

05:29.490 --> 05:31.020
- My daughter
is a registered nurse

05:31.020 --> 05:32.190
at New York General.

05:32.190 --> 05:33.790
- Oh, New York General.

05:33.790 --> 05:36.530
We have a friend there.
Do you know Dr. Jaya Desai?

05:36.530 --> 05:38.160
- I'm sure we might have
crossed paths.

05:38.160 --> 05:39.760
It's a pretty big hospital.

05:39.760 --> 05:41.900
But, um, sorry, Dad,
I didn't mean work.

05:41.900 --> 05:43.230
I meant I had to go
to a meeting.

05:43.230 --> 05:44.940
- Oh, okay, good.
Call me later.

05:44.940 --> 05:47.810
- Okay, um,
nice to meet you guys.

05:49.410 --> 05:52.680
- Excuse me, but I have to
make the rounds.

05:52.680 --> 05:54.810
- Well, did you
find out anything?

05:54.810 --> 05:57.320
- No, and something
definitely feels off.

05:57.320 --> 05:58.950
- Yeah, whatever it is,

05:58.950 --> 06:00.590
she doesn't want her father
to know about it.

06:00.590 --> 06:01.720
- Dad, don't worry.

06:01.720 --> 06:04.160
I'm gonna figure out
what's going on.

06:06.260 --> 06:07.460
- You're such a good boyfriend

06:07.460 --> 06:08.830
to have lunch
in between my rounds.

06:08.830 --> 06:10.330
- I mean,
for a hospital cafeteria,

06:10.330 --> 06:12.260
they make a mean burrito.

06:12.260 --> 06:14.270
So, good news:

06:14.270 --> 06:16.370
my parents want
to have dinner with us.

06:16.370 --> 06:18.470
- I'm sorry,
how is that good news?

06:18.470 --> 06:20.240
They don't exactly like me.

06:20.240 --> 06:22.470
- Of course they like you.

06:22.470 --> 06:25.240
Okay, so let's use this
as a chance

06:25.240 --> 06:27.750
to show them
how good you're doing now.

06:28.150 --> 06:30.180
It'll be fine.

06:34.750 --> 06:37.020
- What's in there?
Alien autopsy?

06:37.020 --> 06:38.690
Just pharmacy.

06:38.690 --> 06:39.860
The hospital's cracked down

06:39.860 --> 06:41.690
since someone's been
stealing meds,

06:41.690 --> 06:43.890
so only doctors
are allowed in there now.

06:43.890 --> 06:45.000
I gotta get back to my rounds,

06:45.000 --> 06:48.270
but dinner, 8:00 p.m.

06:48.270 --> 06:50.400
Bring your A game.

07:09.090 --> 07:10.550
- Hey, Miles, it's me.

07:10.550 --> 07:12.220
- Hey, Rakesh,
I've been trying to call you.

07:12.220 --> 07:13.920
You still with Jaya?
- No, but get this:

07:13.920 --> 07:15.860
Claire works
at New York General.

07:15.860 --> 07:17.760
- Yeah, yeah, I know.
She just told me.

07:17.760 --> 07:19.800
How do you know?
- 'Cause I just saw her

07:19.800 --> 07:21.530
sneak
into the hospital's pharmacy,

07:21.530 --> 07:22.700
and according to Jaya,

07:22.700 --> 07:24.270
only doctors are allowed
in there.

07:24.270 --> 07:26.970
- Rakesh,
she's a recovering addict.

07:26.970 --> 07:30.440
- Miles, that's not good,
because I'm pretty sure

07:30.440 --> 07:32.540
she just stole drugs
from the hospital.

07:41.520 --> 07:43.060
- Are you certain
she was stealing?

07:43.060 --> 07:44.960
- Well, it looks that way,
and according to Jaya,

07:44.960 --> 07:47.200
it's not the first time
meds have gone missing.

07:47.200 --> 07:48.860
The hospital's
already investigating.

07:48.860 --> 07:50.870
- Well, i-if she gets caught,
she can go to jail.

07:50.870 --> 07:52.570
I should speak to her father.
Let him know what's going on.

07:52.570 --> 07:54.040
- Wait, Dad.

07:54.040 --> 07:56.270
I need to be absolutely sure
what's going on with her

07:56.270 --> 07:58.270
before involving her father.

07:58.270 --> 08:00.110
- I was there two years ago

08:00.110 --> 08:02.810
when Bishop Thompson had
to intervene in Claire's life.

08:02.810 --> 08:05.780
She almost didn't come through.

08:05.780 --> 08:07.080
- Hey, Rakesh.

08:07.080 --> 08:08.720
Uh, any--any luck
with finding Claire?

08:08.720 --> 08:10.390
- No, but I do have a lead.

08:10.390 --> 08:12.320
It turns out you guys have
a mutual friend on Facebook.

08:12.320 --> 08:13.820
- Who?
- Rachel Blake.

08:13.820 --> 08:15.320
- Who's Rachel Blake?

08:15.320 --> 08:19.030
- Uh, she was
a Friend Suggestion a year ago.

08:19.030 --> 08:21.000
Her sister died
in a car accident

08:21.000 --> 08:22.870
not too far
from Harlem Episcopal.

08:22.870 --> 08:24.730
- Oh, I remember you
telling me about her.

08:24.730 --> 08:26.340
- Well, according
to her Facebook,

08:26.340 --> 08:28.300
she just checked in
to Harlem Community College.

08:28.300 --> 08:29.940
She's teaching art there.

08:29.940 --> 08:31.410
- Let me talk to Rachel.

08:31.410 --> 08:33.810
Maybe she knows how
to get in touch with Claire.

08:33.810 --> 08:35.810
If not, we'll go to the bishop.

08:37.850 --> 08:40.220
- Keep me posted.

08:50.860 --> 08:52.700
- Can I help you?

08:52.700 --> 08:55.600
- Oh, sorry,
this used to be my office.

08:55.600 --> 08:56.670
I'm Cara Bloom.

08:56.670 --> 08:59.030
- Adam Grey.

08:59.030 --> 09:01.240
You know,
I've heard a lot about you.

09:01.240 --> 09:02.570
When I first started here,

09:02.570 --> 09:04.910
everyone said
I had very big shoes to fill.

09:04.910 --> 09:07.140
- Oh, well, I only wear
a size six, so...

09:07.140 --> 09:09.380
- Cara, there you are.
- Hey, Parker.

09:09.380 --> 09:10.850
- I see you met Adam.

09:10.850 --> 09:12.920
He just came over
from "Chatter" six weeks ago.

09:12.920 --> 09:15.250
Been at the top
of the leaderboard ever since.

09:15.250 --> 09:17.250
- Anyways, uh, it was great
to meet you.

09:17.250 --> 09:20.820
If you ever need anything,
my office is always open.

09:22.660 --> 09:24.890
- Come on.
Natalie's tied up in a meeting.

09:24.890 --> 09:27.300
Sent me to show you
to your office.

09:29.770 --> 09:31.570
It's so good having you back.

09:31.570 --> 09:33.440
"Catapult" hasn't felt the same
without you.

09:33.440 --> 09:34.770
- Thank you, Parker.

09:34.770 --> 09:37.270
Yeah, it's good to be back.

09:41.540 --> 09:43.010
- Here we are.

09:43.010 --> 09:45.680
- I know, sorry.

09:45.680 --> 09:48.220
- It's fine.
Gotta work my way back up.

09:48.220 --> 09:49.850
- Knowing you,
I'm sure it won't take long.

09:49.850 --> 09:52.350
Lunch today?
- Yeah, definitely.

10:09.370 --> 10:11.210
Rachel Blake, wow.

10:11.210 --> 10:13.240
So any idea
how she knows Claire?

10:13.240 --> 10:14.310
- No, but hopefully

10:14.310 --> 10:15.640
they're more
than just Facebook friends.

10:15.640 --> 10:17.150
We need to find Claire fast.

10:17.150 --> 10:18.680
- Yeah, well,
knowing the God Account,

10:18.680 --> 10:19.880
Rachel coming into the picture

10:19.880 --> 10:21.180
is more
than just a coincidence.

10:23.090 --> 10:26.490
Hey, how did it go
at "Catapult"?

10:26.490 --> 10:28.720
- Honestly, not great.

10:28.720 --> 10:30.090
You know, I thought going back

10:30.090 --> 10:31.690
would be like picking up
where I left off,

10:31.690 --> 10:34.400
but kind of feels like
I'm starting over.

10:34.400 --> 10:36.900
- Sometimes starting over
isn't such a bad thing.

10:38.830 --> 10:41.100
- Yeah, maybe you're right.

10:41.100 --> 10:42.840
Plus, it'll be
that much more satisfying

10:42.840 --> 10:44.110
when I get back on top
of the leaderboard.

10:44.110 --> 10:46.580
- Yeah.
Hey, that's Rachel.

10:46.580 --> 10:48.210
- I don't know if you're
supposed to be telling me that.

10:48.210 --> 10:50.450
Oh, you know what?
Give me a sec.

10:50.450 --> 10:52.250
Miles!

10:52.250 --> 10:53.150
This is such a surprise.

10:53.150 --> 10:54.780
Aww.
- Good to see you.

10:54.780 --> 10:57.450
This is Cara.
- Rachel, nice to meet you.

10:57.450 --> 10:58.690
- Yeah, you, too.

10:58.690 --> 10:59.760
I know we haven't
actually met,

10:59.760 --> 11:01.220
but I feel like I know you.

11:01.220 --> 11:02.520
- I'm a big fan
of the "Millennial Prophet,"

11:02.520 --> 11:05.330
so I hear your name a lot.

11:05.330 --> 11:06.960
So I'm guessing
running into you guys

11:06.960 --> 11:08.530
isn't a coincidence.

11:08.530 --> 11:09.930
- Not exactly.

11:09.930 --> 11:12.940
We're trying to get ahold
of Claire Thompson.

11:12.940 --> 11:15.040
We were hoping you could help.
- How do you know Claire?

11:15.040 --> 11:18.210
- She is my Friend Suggestion.

11:21.540 --> 11:25.010
- I would never normally talk
about someone from the program,

11:25.010 --> 11:27.680
but if the God Account
sent you Claire's name,

11:27.680 --> 11:28.980
something is clearly wrong.

11:28.980 --> 11:31.190
- "The program"?
You met Claire in AA?

11:31.190 --> 11:34.020
- Last year,
after Miles helped me.

11:34.020 --> 11:35.190
Claire and I became friends.

11:35.190 --> 11:36.830
- Look, we need
to talk to Claire.

11:36.830 --> 11:39.660
We think she may have relapsed.

11:39.660 --> 11:40.660
What is it?

11:40.660 --> 11:41.930
- About a week ago,

11:41.930 --> 11:42.930
we were coming out
of a meeting.

11:42.930 --> 11:44.600
She got some text.

11:44.600 --> 11:47.240
She asked if I could give her
a lift to a duplex

11:47.240 --> 11:48.400
in Jackson Heights.

11:48.400 --> 11:49.810
Said it was urgent.

11:49.810 --> 11:51.470
I tried to ask
what was going on,

11:51.470 --> 11:52.740
but she wouldn't say,

11:52.740 --> 11:54.410
and I was gonna talk
to her about it

11:54.410 --> 11:56.080
at our meeting yesterday,
but she didn't show.

11:56.080 --> 11:57.580
- Any chance
you remember that address?

11:57.580 --> 11:59.180
- Yeah.

11:59.180 --> 12:01.280
But if Claire's in trouble,
I'm coming with you.

12:02.850 --> 12:05.320
- Thank you for making us
dinner, Ms. Desai.

12:05.320 --> 12:06.690
I love the chicken.

12:06.690 --> 12:09.390
It's so moist.

12:09.390 --> 12:10.860
- Thank you, Rakesh.

12:10.860 --> 12:12.630
- Yes, I think
we all appreciate your review

12:12.630 --> 12:14.430
of the chicken.

12:14.430 --> 12:16.570
- Listen, we have something
to talk to you about.

12:16.570 --> 12:17.770
Both of you.

12:17.770 --> 12:19.970
- Wait, could I
say something first?

12:19.970 --> 12:23.010
I know you guys didn't think
much of me when we first met,

12:23.010 --> 12:24.940
but I promise
that if you give me a chance,

12:24.940 --> 12:28.340
I will prove that I am worthy
of your daughter.

12:30.550 --> 12:32.580
W-what'd I say?

12:32.580 --> 12:35.320
- Uh, you have nothing
to be nervous about, Rakesh.

12:35.320 --> 12:37.320
You've just gone
from customer service

12:37.320 --> 12:40.960
to being the head of R&D
at, uh, IdentitySeal.

12:40.960 --> 12:42.930
You finally have
your own apartment now,

12:42.930 --> 12:45.390
and, uh, we know exactly
how well

12:45.390 --> 12:46.730
you've been doing lately.

12:46.730 --> 12:48.100
- Yeah, you know...

12:48.100 --> 12:49.400
I mean,
if you put it like that,

12:49.400 --> 12:50.530
I guess I'm kind of awesome.

12:50.530 --> 12:52.000
- And so humble.

12:52.000 --> 12:55.600
- You'll make an ideal husband
for our Jaya,

12:55.600 --> 12:57.640
which is why we feel it is time

12:57.640 --> 12:59.880
for you two to get engaged.

13:02.180 --> 13:05.250
- Mama, Papa, don't you think
we're moving a little fast?

13:05.250 --> 13:06.750
- Nonsense.

13:06.750 --> 13:09.450
At your age, we'd already
been married three years

13:09.450 --> 13:11.020
and I was pregnant with you.

13:11.020 --> 13:12.690
If anything,

13:12.690 --> 13:15.820
you have some
catching up to do.

13:15.820 --> 13:17.630
- Are we talking about kids
right now?

13:17.630 --> 13:18.860
- Well, of course.

13:18.860 --> 13:20.860
These are the next steps,

13:20.860 --> 13:23.630
and we cannot wait
to have grandchildren.

13:23.630 --> 13:25.400
- A toast...

13:25.400 --> 13:29.340
to the impending union
of Jaya and Rakesh.

13:29.340 --> 13:31.340
A perfect match.

13:38.010 --> 13:40.250
- It's just up the block.

13:40.250 --> 13:41.680
Thanks for helping us.

13:41.680 --> 13:43.520
Cara and I
had to cancel our date.

13:43.520 --> 13:45.490
- Yeah, I hope
we didn't hijack your night.

13:45.490 --> 13:48.060
- No, it's fine.
It's just my birthday.

13:48.060 --> 13:49.760
- What?

13:49.760 --> 13:51.830
That's what we call it
in the program.

13:51.830 --> 13:54.800
I'm one year sober today.
- Hey, congratulations.

13:54.800 --> 13:56.330
- Thanks.

13:56.330 --> 13:58.630
I was planning on celebrating
with a six-pack...

13:58.630 --> 13:59.700
- Huh?

13:59.700 --> 14:01.270
- Of LaCroix
and a Smiths album,

14:01.270 --> 14:03.000
but think
I can rain check that.

14:03.000 --> 14:05.240
This is it.

14:15.380 --> 14:18.620
- Okay, we should split up,
knock on a few doors.

14:24.090 --> 14:25.430
Claire.

14:25.430 --> 14:27.900
- Miles, Rachel,
w-what are you doing here?

14:27.900 --> 14:29.300
- We need to talk.

14:29.300 --> 14:31.130
- My friend saw you
stealing medication

14:31.130 --> 14:32.930
from New York General.

14:32.930 --> 14:36.670
- You've got this all wrong.
- Okay, so explain it to us.

14:44.910 --> 14:46.350
- What is this place?

14:46.350 --> 14:48.050
- It's a free clinic

14:48.050 --> 14:49.880
for patients
who can't afford healthcare.

14:49.880 --> 14:51.620
I didn't relapse.

14:51.620 --> 14:54.690
I've been stealing medication
so I can save lives.

15:01.070 --> 15:02.600
- How long
have you been doing this?

15:02.600 --> 15:06.540
- Well, I opened the clinic
a few months ago...

15:06.540 --> 15:08.670
and, uh, then I started working
on the weekends.

15:08.670 --> 15:10.840
Now I'm here every night.

15:14.450 --> 15:15.750
- Gracias.
- Mm-hmm.

15:15.750 --> 15:17.720
Hey.

15:23.660 --> 15:25.290
Isabel is ten years old.

15:25.290 --> 15:27.490
She has type 1 diabetes.

15:27.490 --> 15:29.260
New York General turned her
and her mother away

15:29.260 --> 15:30.860
because they
don't have insurance.

15:30.860 --> 15:32.500
Most immigrants
in this area don't.

15:32.500 --> 15:34.130
That's why I opened this place.

15:34.130 --> 15:36.400
- There must be
some free clinic

15:36.400 --> 15:37.840
that they can go to.

15:37.840 --> 15:40.040
- Most are overcrowded
and nowhere near this area.

15:40.040 --> 15:42.510
- No one is questioning
your intentions,

15:42.510 --> 15:43.980
but there must be a way

15:43.980 --> 15:46.550
that you can raise funds
to make this legal.

15:46.550 --> 15:48.080
- I've tried.

15:48.080 --> 15:50.320
I have applied for grants,
but nothing has come through.

15:50.320 --> 15:52.590
- Okay, but the hospital
is investigating.

15:52.590 --> 15:54.320
How long
until they figure out it's you?

15:54.320 --> 15:56.960
- They won't.

15:56.960 --> 15:58.820
Half the nurses
at New York General

15:58.820 --> 16:00.260
have the passcode
to the pharmacy.

16:00.260 --> 16:02.860
- But none of them
are stealing.

16:02.860 --> 16:05.400
- It's a risk
I'm gonna have to take.

16:05.400 --> 16:06.730
There's no other way.

16:06.730 --> 16:09.140
- Well, then, let us help you.

16:09.140 --> 16:11.640
Your dad is the bishop
of New York.

16:11.640 --> 16:13.940
There must be something
he can do.

16:13.940 --> 16:16.510
- When I first had the idea
about this place,

16:16.510 --> 16:18.140
I went to him.

16:18.140 --> 16:20.980
He told me that
I should focus on recovery.

16:20.980 --> 16:24.320
Look, I appreciate
your concern...

16:25.720 --> 16:27.550
But I'm gonna ask you
to stay out of this.

16:40.370 --> 16:42.300
- What are we gonna do?

16:42.300 --> 16:44.640
- I don't know.

16:44.640 --> 16:47.470
- Okay, went ahead
and made your usuals.

16:47.470 --> 16:49.810
You're welcome.
What's going on?

16:51.480 --> 16:54.810
What did you do?
- Me? Nothing.

16:54.810 --> 16:56.110
Not me, it's her parents.

16:56.110 --> 16:57.920
They want us to get engaged

16:57.920 --> 17:00.520
and get married and have kids.

17:00.520 --> 17:02.850
- And by the look
on both of your faces,

17:02.850 --> 17:05.190
I am guessing that neither
of you are ready for that.

17:05.190 --> 17:08.190
- No, not even close.

17:08.190 --> 17:10.930
I mean, I love you, but--
- Rakesh, relax.

17:10.930 --> 17:12.400
Of course we're not ready.

17:12.400 --> 17:14.370
My life is crazy
with my residency,

17:14.370 --> 17:15.700
and you're running
a whole department

17:15.700 --> 17:16.840
at IdentitySeal.

17:16.840 --> 17:18.740
And we've only been dating
in the same state

17:18.740 --> 17:20.270
for a few months.

17:20.270 --> 17:21.640
- Well, why don't you just
say that to your parents?

17:21.640 --> 17:24.440
They won't understand.

17:24.440 --> 17:26.350
In our culture,
there are a lot of expectations

17:26.350 --> 17:28.010
parents have for their kids.

17:28.010 --> 17:29.550
Mine have always had
a plan for me,

17:29.550 --> 17:32.220
and after all they sacrificed,

17:32.220 --> 17:34.690
I--I just can't
disappoint them.

17:36.150 --> 17:37.790
- So what are you gonna do?

17:37.790 --> 17:39.360
- No clue.

17:39.360 --> 17:40.760
I mean, who would have thought
that my getting my break

17:40.760 --> 17:43.960
at IdentitySeal
would be our downfall?

17:45.960 --> 17:47.800
Wait, that's it.

17:47.800 --> 17:49.870
- What's it?

17:49.870 --> 17:51.540
- IdentitySeal.

17:51.540 --> 17:54.110
Me becoming the head of R&D
took me from zero to hero

17:54.110 --> 17:55.170
with your family, right?

17:55.170 --> 17:57.140
- Mm-hmm.

17:57.140 --> 17:58.680
- What if I got fired?

17:58.680 --> 18:00.850
- Rakesh, I'm not gonna let you
lose your job over this.

18:00.850 --> 18:02.250
That's crazy.

18:02.250 --> 18:05.150
- No, Jaya, we pretend
that I got fired.

18:05.150 --> 18:06.950
Then I go back to being zero,

18:06.950 --> 18:08.450
and they won't make us
get engaged.

18:08.450 --> 18:11.190
- And we can keep on dating.

18:11.190 --> 18:14.760
Rakesh, you're a genius.

18:18.630 --> 18:22.370
- Wow, Dad,
this place looks great.

18:22.370 --> 18:24.240
Look, I--I know you guys
have only been living here

18:24.240 --> 18:25.570
for a few weeks,
but it looks like

18:25.570 --> 18:26.870
you've been living here
for years.

18:26.870 --> 18:28.240
- Well, I appreciate that.

18:28.240 --> 18:29.540
Um, Trish and I
have worked hard

18:29.540 --> 18:31.310
to make this place
feel like home.

18:31.310 --> 18:34.250
So, uh, were you able
to talk to Claire?

18:34.250 --> 18:37.480
- Yes, and thankfully,
she hasn't relapsed.

18:37.480 --> 18:39.080
- Oh, that's good news.

18:39.080 --> 18:42.320
But, um, what about her
stealing from the hospital?

18:42.320 --> 18:43.490
- It wasn't for her.

18:43.490 --> 18:45.360
She started
an underground clinic

18:45.360 --> 18:47.360
to treat patients
who don't have healthcare.

18:47.360 --> 18:49.490
- Oh, my God.

18:49.490 --> 18:52.200
That's a noble cause, Miles,

18:52.200 --> 18:55.230
um, but it doesn't
excuse her actions.

18:55.230 --> 18:56.640
She's still committing a crime,

18:56.640 --> 18:59.240
one that could land her
in jail.

18:59.240 --> 19:01.710
- I know, but the only way
she is going to stop

19:01.710 --> 19:05.110
is if she gets the funds
to make her clinic legal.

19:05.110 --> 19:07.450
So I thought you could help.

19:09.410 --> 19:12.320
- Well, there are grants
that the church provides.

19:12.320 --> 19:15.020
I mean, that's how
I first opened the soup kitchen

19:15.020 --> 19:17.620
and the shelter
at Harlem Episcopal.

19:17.620 --> 19:21.030
It's a slow process.

19:21.030 --> 19:24.560
But there is one person
who could expedite things.

19:24.560 --> 19:26.360
- Bishop Thompson?
- Mm.

19:26.360 --> 19:28.070
- Dad, Claire doesn't want
to involve him.

19:28.070 --> 19:30.770
She thinks he won't understand.
- Her father loves her.

19:30.770 --> 19:32.740
He--he didn't turn his back
on her two years ago,

19:32.740 --> 19:34.570
and he won't do it now.

19:34.570 --> 19:36.240
You want to help Claire?
- Mm-hmm.

19:36.240 --> 19:38.310
- You should talk to him.

19:44.480 --> 19:46.320
- Love what you've done
with the place.

19:46.320 --> 19:48.750
Very funny, Parker.

19:48.750 --> 19:50.060
What's up?

19:50.060 --> 19:51.390
- Well, now that you're back
at "Catapult,"

19:51.390 --> 19:54.290
I figured we'd do
what we do best: gossip.

19:54.290 --> 19:56.130
- No, no,
that's what you do best.

19:56.130 --> 19:57.330
- True.

19:57.330 --> 19:58.400
What's going on
with you and Miles?

19:58.400 --> 20:00.030
How'd your date go last night?

20:00.030 --> 20:02.100
- Uh, it didn't.

20:02.100 --> 20:03.840
- Let me guess: God Account?

20:03.840 --> 20:06.240
- Yes, but we rescheduled
for tonight.

20:06.240 --> 20:08.270
We are determined
to have a normal dating life.

20:08.270 --> 20:09.780
- Good for you.

20:09.780 --> 20:12.680
So boyfriend and job exactly
where you want them to be.

20:12.680 --> 20:16.280
- Boyfriend, yes.
Job, not so much.

20:16.280 --> 20:18.880
Hey, what can you tell me
about this Adam guy?

20:18.880 --> 20:20.650
- He's a great writer.
- "A great writer"?

20:20.650 --> 20:22.490
Really?
- You haven't read his stuff?

20:22.490 --> 20:23.660
- No!

20:23.660 --> 20:25.420
I've seen his headlines.
They're clickbait.

20:25.420 --> 20:26.930
It's what gossip sites do.

20:26.930 --> 20:28.790
- What do you have
against gossip sites?

20:28.790 --> 20:31.230
- Sorry, I didn't mean it
like that.

20:31.230 --> 20:34.370
- And cue my exit.

20:34.370 --> 20:36.100
- I was kidding.

20:36.100 --> 20:38.300
- So, uh, what brings you
down here?

20:38.300 --> 20:40.970
- Curiosity, I guess.
- About?

20:40.970 --> 20:44.310
- Why you would give up writing
a book about Simon Hayes

20:44.310 --> 20:46.110
to come back to work
at "Catapult."

20:47.550 --> 20:50.080
- Let's just say I wanted
to write my own stories.

20:50.080 --> 20:51.520
- I respect that.

20:51.520 --> 20:53.450
I've read most of them.
They're very good.

20:53.450 --> 20:55.720
- Why do I feel like
there's a "but" coming?

20:55.720 --> 20:57.760
- But they tend to

20:57.760 --> 21:00.190
get a little repetitive.

21:00.190 --> 21:03.530
I mean, they're essentially
variations of the same story.

21:03.530 --> 21:05.760
- Yeah,
because they're a series,

21:05.760 --> 21:07.370
a very successful one

21:07.370 --> 21:11.140
that explores the positive side
of humanity, unlike gossip.

21:11.140 --> 21:12.400
Anyways, this has been
really fun,

21:12.400 --> 21:14.010
but I gotta get back
to writing my story.

21:14.010 --> 21:15.270
You can check it out

21:15.270 --> 21:16.410
when it hits the top
of the leaderboard.

21:16.410 --> 21:18.380
- Sound pretty confident.

21:18.380 --> 21:21.050
Care to make it interesting?

21:21.050 --> 21:22.350
- What do you have in mind?

21:22.350 --> 21:24.580
- Your story beats mine
this week,

21:24.580 --> 21:27.590
and I'll let you have
your old office back.

21:27.590 --> 21:29.550
What do you say?

21:29.550 --> 21:31.620
- I'd say
start packing your stuff.

21:36.530 --> 21:38.360
- I don't know what to say.

21:38.360 --> 21:40.370
Stealing from a hospital?
What was she thinking?

21:40.370 --> 21:43.240
- Well, she was thinking
about helping people.

21:43.240 --> 21:45.500
Look, I--I'm not
defending her actions,

21:45.500 --> 21:48.770
but her heart
was in the right place.

21:48.770 --> 21:49.980
- That may be, Miles,

21:49.980 --> 21:53.180
but her actions
have jeopardized her future,

21:53.180 --> 21:54.650
everything she was working for.

21:54.650 --> 21:56.680
- Edward, we understand
how serious this is,

21:56.680 --> 21:58.450
but there is a solution.

21:58.450 --> 22:00.850
- Claire has been
applying for grants

22:00.850 --> 22:02.520
to make her clinic legal,

22:02.520 --> 22:04.320
and we were hoping
that you could help.

22:04.320 --> 22:05.990
- She was afraid
to come to you,

22:05.990 --> 22:07.590
how you would judge her.

22:07.590 --> 22:10.160
So this is a chance
for you to be there for her

22:10.160 --> 22:12.200
as you always have.

22:13.900 --> 22:15.770
- You're right, Arthur.

22:15.770 --> 22:19.240
My daughter needs me
and I--I can't let her down.

22:19.240 --> 22:21.970
Uh, thank you,

22:21.970 --> 22:23.710
both of you.

22:23.710 --> 22:26.810
I'll, um--I'll go
make some calls.

22:29.580 --> 22:31.720
- Claire's gonna be so relieved
that her father wants to help.

22:31.720 --> 22:34.490
- Yes, and once we tell her
the good news,

22:34.490 --> 22:36.920
we can have that date
that we missed.

22:36.920 --> 22:39.390
Still good for 8:00?
- Yeah, sounds perfect.

22:40.330 --> 22:42.690
- Hey.
Hey, Claire.

22:43.860 --> 22:45.260
- What are you doing here?

22:45.260 --> 22:47.400
- Look, I know you wanted us
to stay out of this,

22:47.400 --> 22:50.900
but we spoke to your dad
and he wants to help.

22:50.900 --> 22:53.170
- Unbelievable.

22:54.810 --> 22:56.540
That explains it.

22:56.540 --> 22:58.510
- What are you talking about?

22:58.510 --> 23:01.680
- My dad just called
the hospital and got me fired.

23:01.680 --> 23:04.950
So thanks to you...

23:04.950 --> 23:06.990
the clinic is over.

23:13.860 --> 23:15.800
- Wait, wait, Claire.
Claire, hold up, hold up.

23:15.800 --> 23:17.530
I'm sorry, that--
that's not what we wanted.

23:17.530 --> 23:19.470
- Tell that to my patients.

23:19.470 --> 23:21.300
- Okay, Claire, look--
Claire, Claire!

23:21.300 --> 23:22.840
We just wanted to help.

23:22.840 --> 23:24.440
- "Help"?

23:24.440 --> 23:26.940
Not only did I lose my job,

23:26.940 --> 23:29.310
I lost access
to the hospital's pharmacy.

23:29.310 --> 23:31.250
You have put a lot of lives
at risk.

23:31.250 --> 23:33.580
- Okay, there must be something
that we could do.

23:33.580 --> 23:35.150
- I don't see how.

23:35.150 --> 23:37.050
- If the hospital knows
you're stealing from them,

23:37.050 --> 23:39.760
why didn't they
get the police involved?

23:39.760 --> 23:41.990
- My dad has friends
on the hospital board.

23:41.990 --> 23:43.690
They agreed
not to press charges.

23:43.690 --> 23:46.260
It's his way of fixing things.

23:46.260 --> 23:48.530
- You know, I'm sure he was
just trying to protect you.

23:48.530 --> 23:50.270
- Please.

23:50.270 --> 23:52.130
He was trying
to protect himself.

23:54.370 --> 23:55.900
He knew that
if the cops got involved,

23:55.900 --> 23:57.810
it would become a scandal,
so he swept it under the rug.

23:57.810 --> 24:00.780
- Okay, well, h-how about
I talk to my dad again, huh?

24:00.780 --> 24:03.350
Your father listens to him.
Maybe he can sort this out.

24:03.350 --> 24:05.450
- Wait.

24:05.450 --> 24:07.880
You told your father
about the clinic.

24:07.880 --> 24:09.620
Let me guess:

24:09.620 --> 24:11.950
he was the one
who wanted to talk to my dad.

24:11.950 --> 24:13.690
- Yeah, why?

24:13.690 --> 24:17.990
- Arthur's working for my dad
as his chief of staff.

24:17.990 --> 24:19.430
You didn't know?

24:19.430 --> 24:20.930
- No.

24:20.930 --> 24:23.300
- Well, I guess having fathers
who put the church first

24:23.300 --> 24:25.100
is something
that we have in common.

24:29.740 --> 24:31.710
- Wait, Miles,
why wouldn't your dad tell you

24:31.710 --> 24:34.940
he was working
for Bishop Thompson?

24:34.940 --> 24:37.580
- I don't know, but believe me,
that's what I'm gonna ask him.

24:43.690 --> 24:45.150
- What was so important

24:45.150 --> 24:48.060
you both had to rush here
to tell us in person?

24:49.360 --> 24:51.560
- Rakesh got fired
from his job.

24:51.560 --> 24:53.530
- W-what?

24:53.530 --> 24:55.400
We thought
you were doing so well.

24:55.400 --> 24:58.170
- Yeah, me, too, but...

24:58.170 --> 25:01.170
I guess I'll probably have
to go back to customer service

25:01.170 --> 25:02.440
and move back in
with my parents.

25:02.440 --> 25:05.170
- That is
very disappointing news.

25:05.170 --> 25:07.310
- Yeah, tell me about it.

25:07.310 --> 25:09.750
I mean, obviously that means
I need to get back on my feet,

25:09.750 --> 25:12.450
and--and prove
that I'm worthy of Jaya

25:12.450 --> 25:15.450
before we get engaged.

25:16.250 --> 25:17.950
- Don't be silly.

25:17.950 --> 25:19.450
There are
more important qualities

25:19.450 --> 25:22.660
in a son-in-law
than just his profession.

25:22.660 --> 25:25.330
- There are?
- Yes.

25:25.330 --> 25:27.560
I mean,
you stuck by our daughter

25:27.560 --> 25:29.630
for all those months
when she was in Minnesota.

25:29.630 --> 25:32.200
We want to stick by you
this time.

25:32.200 --> 25:33.540
- And you heard the whole part

25:33.540 --> 25:34.740
about me moving back in
with my parents?

25:34.740 --> 25:36.270
- Mm-hmm.
- Into their basement.

25:36.270 --> 25:37.340
- Yeah.

25:37.340 --> 25:38.670
I mean, after the wedding,

25:38.670 --> 25:40.610
we'll help you
find a place together.

25:40.610 --> 25:42.610
- Jaya makes
an excellent salary

25:42.610 --> 25:43.610
as a physician.

25:43.610 --> 25:45.610
You'll be fine.

25:47.520 --> 25:49.850
We love you, Rakesh.

25:57.690 --> 25:59.560
- Miles.

26:03.430 --> 26:05.470
I'm, uh--I'm glad
you dropped by.

26:05.470 --> 26:07.170
I was, uh, just about
to call you.

26:07.170 --> 26:09.340
- Is that before or after

26:09.340 --> 26:11.270
your boss had Claire fired
at the hospital?

26:11.270 --> 26:12.940
- So she told you
that I work for her father.

26:12.940 --> 26:14.840
- The question is,
why didn't you?

26:14.840 --> 26:17.110
- Because I haven't decided
if it's something that I want.

26:17.110 --> 26:19.750
-  Wow,
you could have fooled me.

26:19.750 --> 26:21.580
Dad, I came to you for help,
but the only person

26:21.580 --> 26:24.120
you were interested in helping
was your new boss.

26:24.120 --> 26:25.650
You manipulated me.

26:25.650 --> 26:27.890
- I did not manipulate you.

26:27.890 --> 26:29.460
I--I would have
gone to Thompson

26:29.460 --> 26:30.990
whether I was working for him
or not.

26:30.990 --> 26:33.360
He's Claire's father.
Ne needed to know.

26:33.360 --> 26:35.000
- He got her fired.

26:35.000 --> 26:38.030
- She's stealing
from the hospital.

26:38.030 --> 26:39.500
What was he supposed to do?

26:39.500 --> 26:41.640
- Here's a crazy idea:
he could help her.

26:41.640 --> 26:42.940
He could help her clinic.

26:42.940 --> 26:45.570
He could help the people
who depend on her.

26:45.570 --> 26:47.040
Or did I miss something

26:47.040 --> 26:48.810
in those Bible verses
you love to quote

26:48.810 --> 26:50.310
about the meek and the sick?

26:50.310 --> 26:52.410
- Whether you want to see it
or not, he is helping her.

26:52.410 --> 26:54.050
- How?

26:54.050 --> 26:56.920
- By keeping her from
getting arrested, for starters.

26:56.920 --> 26:58.490
Look...

27:00.820 --> 27:03.690
I'm sorry I didn't tell you
about the job.

27:03.690 --> 27:05.860
I'll talk to Thompson
and see if I can try

27:05.860 --> 27:08.560
and find a way
to help her patients legally,

27:08.560 --> 27:11.270
but what Claire was doing
was dangerous,

27:11.270 --> 27:13.000
and you know it.

27:13.000 --> 27:15.470
Trust me on this.

27:20.140 --> 27:22.410
What is it?

27:22.410 --> 27:23.550
- It's Rachel.

27:23.550 --> 27:24.910
Claire just got arrested

27:24.910 --> 27:26.750
for trying to buy painkillers
off of a dealer.

27:26.750 --> 27:29.250
She's at the 98th Precinct.
I gotta go down there.

27:29.250 --> 27:31.350
- I'm coming with you.

27:34.220 --> 27:35.520
- Miles.

27:35.520 --> 27:36.990
- Hey, we came
as soon as we could.

27:36.990 --> 27:39.630
- Her dad's inside.
He just bailed her out.

27:39.630 --> 27:41.460
- Claire, we have to talk
about this.

27:41.460 --> 27:42.830
- I'm not in the mood

27:42.830 --> 27:44.370
for a father-daughter convo
right now.

27:44.370 --> 27:45.600
- You don't want
to talk to me, fine.

27:45.600 --> 27:46.670
You can talk
to one of the counselors

27:46.670 --> 27:47.740
at the intake center.

27:47.740 --> 27:50.040
- I am not going back to rehab.

27:50.040 --> 27:52.240
I'm not using.

27:52.240 --> 27:54.310
- Not yet, but it's clearly
just a matter of time.

27:54.310 --> 27:56.610
- Claire, please, your father's
just here to help.

27:56.610 --> 27:59.450
- This is none
of your business.

27:59.450 --> 28:00.780
I don't need help.

28:00.780 --> 28:03.220
I have been sober
for two years.

28:03.220 --> 28:05.190
I am not headed for a relapse.

28:05.190 --> 28:06.820
- Look around you.

28:06.820 --> 28:09.120
I just bailed you out of jail
for buying painkillers.

28:09.120 --> 28:10.960
- They were for my patients.

28:10.960 --> 28:12.360
- And I believe you,

28:12.360 --> 28:13.930
but how many lines
do you have to cross

28:13.930 --> 28:15.630
before it all
becomes a blur--

28:15.630 --> 28:19.330
- Stop talking like you know
what I went through.

28:19.330 --> 28:21.700
You don't.

28:21.700 --> 28:25.270
You can never understand.

28:25.270 --> 28:27.540
- Claire, wait.

28:27.540 --> 28:30.010
I do understand.

28:31.280 --> 28:34.080
More than anyone.

28:34.080 --> 28:37.020
- No, you don't...

28:38.650 --> 28:41.390
And you never will.

28:45.390 --> 28:47.160
- I'll make sure she's okay.

28:58.110 --> 29:01.440
- So, you still want me
to trust you on this?

29:09.020 --> 29:10.720
What are we gonna do?

29:10.720 --> 29:12.220
I mean, it seems like things
have gotten worse.

29:12.220 --> 29:14.260
- Yeah, and I don't think
Claire is gonna stop

29:14.260 --> 29:15.830
trying to save her clinic,

29:15.830 --> 29:17.860
which means she's gonna keep
putting herself at risk.

29:17.860 --> 29:20.570
- We need to figure out a way
to get through to her.

29:27.170 --> 29:29.210
- May I come in?

29:33.910 --> 29:36.820
I spoke to Thompson
after you left.

29:36.820 --> 29:39.790
He's scared for his daughter.
- Yeah, so am I.

29:39.790 --> 29:41.490
- Then let's figure out
a way to help her.

29:41.490 --> 29:42.920
- Is this coming from you,

29:42.920 --> 29:45.190
or Bishop Thompson's
chief of staff?

29:45.190 --> 29:47.630
- Actually, I don't think
I'm going to stay on

29:47.630 --> 29:48.760
in that capacity any longer.

29:48.760 --> 29:50.560
- Wait, you're stepping down?

29:50.560 --> 29:52.160
- It was a trial run.

29:52.160 --> 29:53.800
I needed to see if I could
juggle something like that

29:53.800 --> 29:55.370
before I spoke to Trish.

29:55.370 --> 29:58.400
Clearly, I have my answer.

29:59.170 --> 30:02.470
I know I'm supposed
to be retired, but...

30:03.910 --> 30:05.610
To feel useful,

30:05.610 --> 30:08.280
to have people rely on you

30:08.280 --> 30:11.550
and then to come through
for them...

30:11.550 --> 30:14.090
I guess...

30:14.090 --> 30:15.950
I miss that.

30:15.950 --> 30:17.560
- Yeah, I know what you mean.

30:17.560 --> 30:20.290
- But, to answer your question,
I'm here as your father,

30:20.290 --> 30:22.790
not as the bishop's
chief of staff,

30:22.790 --> 30:25.300
and I wouldn't want anything
to come between us.

30:25.300 --> 30:27.230
- I'm glad.

30:29.940 --> 30:31.640
- Wait, that's it.

30:33.270 --> 30:35.440
I think we've been looking
at this all wrong.

30:35.440 --> 30:37.640
This isn't about helping Claire
keep her clinic.

30:37.640 --> 30:39.440
I think this about
bringing a father

30:39.440 --> 30:40.750
and daughter back together,

30:40.750 --> 30:42.080
healing the fracture
between them.

30:42.080 --> 30:43.650
- You got that
from watching us?

30:43.650 --> 30:45.280
- I think she's right.

30:45.280 --> 30:46.620
Thompson wants that
more than anything.

30:46.620 --> 30:47.920
I mean, he blames himself

30:47.920 --> 30:49.220
for not being able
to reach her.

30:49.220 --> 30:50.360
- Yeah, he--he does.

30:50.360 --> 30:52.760
I saw it at the precinct.

30:52.760 --> 30:54.290
But I think
there was something more.

30:54.290 --> 30:56.230
He said that he understood
what Claire was going through.

30:56.230 --> 30:58.760
- Then you should
talk to the bishop.

30:58.760 --> 31:01.600
- No, we should talk
to him together.

31:12.140 --> 31:14.110
- Have you heard
from Claire yet?

31:14.110 --> 31:15.350
- Not yet.

31:15.350 --> 31:17.880
- I don't know
how to get through to her.

31:17.880 --> 31:21.120
I know how it looks,
me getting her fired.

31:21.120 --> 31:24.590
I was just trying
to protect her.

31:24.590 --> 31:28.230
- At the precinct, you were
going to tell her something

31:28.230 --> 31:29.490
before she left.

31:29.490 --> 31:31.100
What was it?

31:31.100 --> 31:33.070
She thinks that
you don't understand

31:33.070 --> 31:35.530
what she's going through,
but you said that you did.

31:35.530 --> 31:37.870
What did you mean?

31:40.670 --> 31:42.610
- I'm 20 years sober.

31:45.580 --> 31:47.180
- Why didn't you ever tell her?

31:47.180 --> 31:49.110
- Because then I'd have to
be honest

31:49.110 --> 31:51.080
with how long I've been sober,

31:51.080 --> 31:54.150
and she'd make the connection.

31:55.490 --> 31:56.920
- What connection?

31:56.920 --> 31:59.060
- My drinking
cost me my marriage.

31:59.060 --> 32:02.130
- 20 years ago
is when you got divorced.

32:02.130 --> 32:05.230
- If Claire knew the truth,
then I'd lose her too.

32:05.230 --> 32:07.500
I couldn't risk that.

32:07.500 --> 32:09.000
I still can't.

32:09.000 --> 32:11.370
- If you don't tell her--

32:11.370 --> 32:13.170
if you can't be there for her

32:13.170 --> 32:17.310
in the way that
she needs most right now,

32:17.310 --> 32:19.110
then you already have.

32:28.850 --> 32:31.520
- I can't believe
our plan backfired.

32:31.520 --> 32:33.060
- What do we do now?

32:33.060 --> 32:34.460
- I could start
looking for rings.

32:34.460 --> 32:35.960
- Rakesh, no.

32:35.960 --> 32:37.300
We should get engaged

32:37.300 --> 32:39.300
because it's something
we want to do,

32:39.300 --> 32:42.430
not something we have to do.

32:42.430 --> 32:45.500
- So what now?

32:45.500 --> 32:47.440
- I stand up to my parents.

32:47.440 --> 32:49.640
- Jaya, are you sure?

32:49.640 --> 32:50.940
- Yeah.

32:50.940 --> 32:53.450
Everything they want for us,
we do too.

32:53.450 --> 32:55.780
Just not right now.

32:55.780 --> 32:57.250
I'll make them understand that.

32:57.250 --> 32:58.650
- And what if they don't?

32:58.650 --> 33:01.590
- Then we'll cross
that bridge together.

33:02.950 --> 33:05.190
- Okay.

33:21.370 --> 33:25.010
- No, I'm here to apologize.

33:25.010 --> 33:26.380
- It's a little too late
for that.

33:26.380 --> 33:28.110
- No.
No, it's not.

33:28.110 --> 33:29.780
Trust me.

33:31.780 --> 33:33.550
- You said...

33:33.550 --> 33:36.150
I don't know what
you've been going through...

33:38.060 --> 33:40.530
But I do.

33:46.200 --> 33:48.170
- I...

33:48.170 --> 33:49.730
I don't understand,

33:49.730 --> 33:52.770
how could you
keep this from me?

33:52.770 --> 33:55.310
All this time, I--I thought
you thought that I was weak,

33:55.310 --> 33:57.880
or that you were ashamed of me.

33:57.880 --> 34:00.180
- No, sweetie.

34:00.180 --> 34:02.350
I was ashamed of me.

34:02.350 --> 34:05.250
It took your mother leaving

34:05.250 --> 34:08.050
for me to get help.

34:08.050 --> 34:09.620
- That's why she left?

34:09.620 --> 34:12.520
- That was my rock bottom.

34:12.520 --> 34:16.730
I went to a meeting
the very next day.

34:16.730 --> 34:18.160
I was so afraid

34:18.160 --> 34:21.000
that if you knew
why she really left...

34:22.230 --> 34:25.800
That you'd never forgive me.

34:25.800 --> 34:27.610
- Why are you telling me now?

34:27.610 --> 34:30.480
- Because I don't want you
to stop helping people,

34:30.480 --> 34:33.340
but we need to do it
the right way.

34:33.340 --> 34:34.710
- "We"?

34:34.710 --> 34:37.950
- Your dad was able
to convince the church

34:37.950 --> 34:39.580
to fund your clinic.

34:39.580 --> 34:42.790
- You're gonna be able
to keep helping people.

34:42.790 --> 34:44.660
- You did that for me?

34:44.660 --> 34:47.430
- Yeah, for both of us.

34:47.430 --> 34:49.290
I thought we could
do it together.

34:49.290 --> 34:53.330
After I tell the diocese
how I covered things up

34:53.330 --> 34:57.270
at the hospital,
I'll be stepping down.

34:57.270 --> 34:59.900
- I told him
that retirement isn't all

34:59.900 --> 35:01.310
that it's cracked up to be.

35:01.310 --> 35:05.140
That it's best
if he found a new purpose.

35:06.640 --> 35:08.510
- And I can't think
of a better one

35:08.510 --> 35:10.520
than helping my daughter.

35:14.490 --> 35:16.650
- I love you, Dad.

35:16.650 --> 35:18.720
- I love you too.

35:39.340 --> 35:41.880
- I need to tell you something.

35:41.880 --> 35:43.210
- You're not
having second thoughts

35:43.210 --> 35:45.520
about our wedding centerpieces,
are you?

35:45.520 --> 35:47.590
- No.

35:51.190 --> 35:52.590
- For the last few days,

35:52.590 --> 35:54.230
I've been working
with Bishop Thompson.

35:56.790 --> 35:59.830
You took the job?

35:59.830 --> 36:01.330
- No, no, I just wanted to see

36:01.330 --> 36:02.800
if I could balance
something like that

36:02.800 --> 36:04.740
with everything else
in my life.

36:04.740 --> 36:07.010
I know that you don't want me
getting involved

36:07.010 --> 36:08.670
in the church again,

36:08.670 --> 36:11.310
but there is a part of me

36:11.310 --> 36:14.880
that's feeling a little lost.

36:14.880 --> 36:18.180
- I understand that...

36:18.180 --> 36:20.820
but then, be honest with me
about it.

36:20.820 --> 36:24.020
- I know, and I'm sorry,

36:24.020 --> 36:25.620
but we don't have to
worry about it,

36:25.620 --> 36:28.890
since Bishop Thompson
is stepping down.

36:28.890 --> 36:32.930
So it looks like you have me

36:32.930 --> 36:36.100
all to yourself after all.

36:36.100 --> 36:39.100
- I like the sound of that.

36:41.640 --> 36:46.080
- We all have a million things
going on at once.

36:46.080 --> 36:48.910
Life pulling us
in every direction.

36:48.910 --> 36:50.520
It can be hard
trying to balance

36:50.520 --> 36:52.350
what's important,
what really matters,

36:52.350 --> 36:54.620
but sometimes we need to stop

36:54.620 --> 36:57.690
and mark the occasions
that are meaningful...

36:57.690 --> 37:00.630
- Miles,
what are you doing here?

37:00.630 --> 37:02.330
- I got you something.

37:02.330 --> 37:04.160
Hmm?

37:04.160 --> 37:05.960
You mentioned
you love The Smiths.

Get to keep your office.

over substance, I guess.

37:47.970 --> 37:50.210
- Not quite.

37:50.210 --> 37:52.610
I read your article.
It was good.

37:52.610 --> 37:54.310
Better than good.

37:54.310 --> 37:57.750
Looks like you were right.
I need to shake things up.

37:57.750 --> 37:59.550
- I might have just the thing.

37:59.550 --> 38:01.820
I'm chasing a story right now
that I think could be huge,

38:01.820 --> 38:03.420
and I could use a hand.

38:03.420 --> 38:04.390
So what do you say?

38:04.390 --> 38:07.260
Wanna share
that number one spot?

38:07.260 --> 38:09.060
- I'll think about it.

38:09.060 --> 38:11.860
- And yet, be careful how
you go about changing things.

38:15.700 --> 38:16.800
- They didn't go for it,
did they?

38:16.800 --> 38:18.400
- No.

38:18.400 --> 38:19.870
They said if we weren't ready
to take the next step,

38:19.870 --> 38:22.070
then we weren't serious.

38:22.070 --> 38:25.180
They said we should break up.

38:25.180 --> 38:26.710
- And you told them we would?

38:26.710 --> 38:29.280
- Yes, but we're not going to.

38:29.280 --> 38:32.220
We just need to be careful
for a little while.

38:32.220 --> 38:34.920
Keep our relationship
between us.

38:34.920 --> 38:37.690
- Ah, a fake breakup.

38:37.690 --> 38:39.220
- Exactly.
- Huh.

38:39.220 --> 38:41.860
- And when we're ready
to take the next step,

38:41.860 --> 38:44.730
then we can put all this
behind us.

38:44.730 --> 38:47.470
- It's hard, I get it,

38:47.470 --> 38:49.930
but sometimes
change is necessary

38:49.930 --> 38:51.570
to take a step forward

38:51.570 --> 38:55.270

Look, if we're gonna balance
dating and the God Account,

39:19.530 --> 39:21.030
we can't do things
like everyone else.

39:21.030 --> 39:23.170
Making reservations,
planning ahead--

39:23.170 --> 39:24.870
it's just not gonna work.

39:24.870 --> 39:27.210
- So how do we make it work?

39:27.210 --> 39:28.470
- Well, we take
the opportunities

39:28.470 --> 39:31.780
when they come,
and we embrace them.

39:31.780 --> 39:35.410
- Sounds good.

39:35.410 --> 39:38.750
- ♪ So make
these moments last ♪

39:38.750 --> 39:39.950
- Thanks for coming.

39:39.950 --> 39:42.190
- You said it was important.

39:42.190 --> 39:45.220
- The Council of Bishops
asked for recommendations

39:45.220 --> 39:46.760
on who I think
should take my place.

39:46.760 --> 39:48.990
- Oh, there's some
great choices.

39:48.990 --> 39:50.290
Uh, do you want me
to give you some names?

39:50.290 --> 39:51.430
- No, no, no.
No need.

39:51.430 --> 39:53.900
I gave them one,
and they agreed.

39:53.900 --> 39:54.930
- Who is it?

39:54.930 --> 39:56.870
- It's you, Arthur.

39:56.870 --> 39:58.900
They want you to take my place

39:58.900 --> 40:01.140
as the bishop of New York.
