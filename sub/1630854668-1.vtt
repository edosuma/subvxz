<i>The longer you're in the game,</i>
<i>the more you know what really matters.</i>

00:38.246 --> 00:40.582
<i>Lone wolves don't get far.</i>

00:42.959 --> 00:44.252
<i>You need a crew.</i>

00:52.552 --> 00:54.804
<i>You got to figure out who you can trust.</i>

00:59.809 --> 01:01.936
<i>'Cause there's two sides to every story.</i>

01:11.988 --> 01:14.657
<i>And neither one's really the truth.</i>

01:19.871 --> 01:22.165
-It's okay…
-I'm so sorry.

01:22.248 --> 01:24.459
-Dickens.
-Yeah.

01:24.542 --> 01:26.586
<i>It's hard to know</i>
<i>who deserves your loyalty.</i>

01:26.669 --> 01:29.214
-I'm Kate.
-Laura.

01:38.181 --> 01:39.140
<i>If you're lucky,</i>

01:39.224 --> 01:43.186
<i>you'll find someone else</i>
<i>who sees the world like you see it…</i>

02:02.288 --> 02:05.792
<i>…who wants the same things</i>
<i>in the same ways.</i>

02:15.260 --> 02:16.261
<i>You're a team.</i>

02:19.472 --> 02:21.641
<i>The both of you against the world.</i>

02:38.825 --> 02:39.826
<i>Or so you think.</i>

02:43.329 --> 02:44.539
Have a good one.

02:57.385 --> 02:59.929
<i>Because trust can be earned.</i>

03:01.681 --> 03:02.891
<i>It can be given…</i>

03:12.233 --> 03:14.944
<i>-and it can be stolen.</i>

03:35.131 --> 03:36.424
<i>And once it's gone…</i>

03:37.050 --> 03:38.801
<i>You have reached a number</i>

03:38.885 --> 03:41.554
<i>that has been disconnected</i>
<i>or is no longer in service.</i>

03:47.227 --> 03:50.146
<i>…it's gone forever.</i>

04:03.368 --> 04:04.869
Took as much as I could carry.

04:05.370 --> 04:08.581
If I were stronger, you'd be poorer.

04:09.207 --> 04:11.542
That is about $2 million.

04:12.710 --> 04:14.254
My associate took it from your box

04:14.337 --> 04:16.464
at the Dunne & Company vault
nine days ago.

04:17.340 --> 04:18.883
Did you even know it was gone?

04:20.551 --> 04:23.221
I don't believe we did, no.

04:23.304 --> 04:27.183
You asked me
to evaluate my competitors' security.

04:28.476 --> 04:29.602
I've found it wanting.

04:29.686 --> 04:30.770
Mmm.

04:30.853 --> 04:32.522
And you recommend…

04:32.605 --> 04:36.442
Uh, you and your partners
have specific needs,

04:36.526 --> 04:38.861
a diverse portfolio,

04:38.945 --> 04:41.489
best kept in a certain amount of shadow,

04:41.572 --> 04:45.785
physical assets in danger of theft,
but also at the mercy of the elements,

04:45.868 --> 04:50.707
I would suggest your only real shot
at security and privacy

04:50.790 --> 04:54.085
is the vault that I have built
and perfected here at SLS.

04:54.168 --> 04:55.920
Hmm.

04:56.004 --> 04:58.715
See, Aldritch Dunne is a personal friend.

04:59.924 --> 05:01.926
I've been banking there for 30 years.

05:02.010 --> 05:04.554
-Hmm.
-Loyalty is worthless.

05:04.637 --> 05:05.680
Faith is dead.

05:07.098 --> 05:09.475
At the end of the day,
all it comes down to

05:09.559 --> 05:12.687
is you versus the people
who want what you have.

05:14.063 --> 05:15.815
And the only thing that matters is,

05:16.691 --> 05:21.029
can you manipulate them
better than they manipulate you?

05:57.523 --> 05:59.650
<i>Only way to pull off the impossible?</i>

06:01.235 --> 06:02.904
<i>Crew up with people you trust.</i>

06:13.581 --> 06:16.876
<i>Or at least trust to do it right.</i>

06:32.100 --> 06:36.354
Stan!
Your parrot shit in the kitchen again.

06:36.437 --> 06:38.689
It's not mine.
And it's not a parrot, Barbara.

06:38.773 --> 06:41.317
It's an ariel toucan.
Fifty left in the world.

06:41.401 --> 06:44.737
Why's he got to be in the kitchen?
I got my leggings party at 6:00.

06:44.821 --> 06:46.697
I'm trading the bird
to a guy in Williamsburg

06:46.781 --> 06:48.533
for a case of Cheval Blanc '47,

06:48.616 --> 06:51.953
which I'm going to trade for a Lotus
from that dentist. That's why.

06:52.036 --> 06:55.665
Stan. Stan. I got my eye doctor
appointment at 3:00.

06:55.748 --> 06:57.417
-I'll take you.
-What's a Lotus?

06:57.500 --> 06:59.085
-Last time we were late.
-It's a car.

06:59.168 --> 07:02.422
-Ma, don't come down. We got hours.
-A car? Why do you need a car?

07:02.505 --> 07:06.259
-Doctor don't like it when I'm late!
-It's for a friend! You'll be on time!

07:06.342 --> 07:07.760
Oh. Uh…

07:07.844 --> 07:10.930
Super. Not a fan of the yelling.

07:12.557 --> 07:14.809
Your parrot's going
in the meat grinder, Stan.

07:16.185 --> 07:17.437
The meat grinder.

07:18.354 --> 07:20.940
One, you better check your tone
when you talk to me.

07:21.023 --> 07:23.234
Two, you are definitely
cleaning up this bird shit.

07:23.317 --> 07:25.653
And three,
you're sleeping on the couch, Stan!

07:25.736 --> 07:27.655
-You're sleeping on the couch!

07:27.738 --> 07:28.781
I love you!

07:34.287 --> 07:37.540
Mr. Rossi, Mr. Rossi,
always kind and never bossy.

07:37.623 --> 07:39.292
Got that little item for you.

07:40.668 --> 07:45.756
Now, as far as customs knows,
this is parmesan.

07:46.340 --> 07:49.135
Not into larvae myself,
but to each his own.

07:49.802 --> 07:51.971
You need anything else,
I'm your guy, okay?

07:52.054 --> 07:53.514
-Thank you.
-Thanks, Stan.

07:59.562 --> 08:01.731
How about a kilo of magic mushrooms?

08:01.814 --> 08:03.399
Depends on how long I got to grow 'em.

08:03.483 --> 08:04.400
Two to five.

08:05.776 --> 08:07.153
Time off for good behavior.

08:10.323 --> 08:11.449
C'mere, you fuck.

08:11.532 --> 08:12.700
-Oh!

08:13.701 --> 08:16.412
Ah, what's up, boss? Oh, man.

08:17.038 --> 08:18.831
-How you doing?
-I'm still here.

08:18.915 --> 08:19.999
-You all right?
-Yeah.

08:25.296 --> 08:26.297
So what's the score?

08:26.380 --> 08:30.051
Why's it gotta be about a score?
Maybe I came in for a ribeye.

08:30.134 --> 08:31.552
I'm retired, Leo.

08:33.346 --> 08:36.766
Ma's a mess
and Barbara's on me like a hawk.

08:36.849 --> 08:38.059
Don't get me wrong, man,

08:38.142 --> 08:41.812
I would love nothing more than to
bow out of this shitshow and mix it up,

08:41.896 --> 08:46.234
but whatever you're cooking,
I got to respectfully decline.

08:48.945 --> 08:51.906
Seven billion dollars. Give or take.

09:05.294 --> 09:06.671
So the vault's underground?

09:06.754 --> 09:10.967
Yeah, deep,
cased in steel-reinforced concrete.

09:11.050 --> 09:14.887
That's fun.
You drill through the door?

09:14.971 --> 09:18.558
Three doors, cobalt-plated.
That's just the appetizer.

09:18.641 --> 09:20.268
-Bring on the main, baby.
-Yeah, right.

09:20.351 --> 09:24.105
To even approach the door,
you got to get into a secure subfloor,

09:25.106 --> 09:29.777
past biometric sensors
laid into an uninterruptible power supply,

09:30.570 --> 09:33.447
linked to security teams
with military training,

09:33.531 --> 09:38.536
who are armed, willing,
and ready to use deadly force.

09:38.619 --> 09:40.746
Still waiting for the punchline here, man.

09:41.956 --> 09:43.165
The Triplets.

09:43.249 --> 09:46.210
Oh, you mean the, uh,
the arson brothers from Block D?

09:46.294 --> 09:48.796
Oh, damn, I forgot about those guys.

09:48.879 --> 09:50.840
-Crazy motherfuckers.

09:50.923 --> 09:54.427
Nah. No, The Triplets
are a different breed of criminal.

09:55.303 --> 09:56.596
<i>Cho-Young Woo,</i>

09:57.513 --> 10:01.267
<i>lead shareholder of Jongo,</i>
<i>Korea's biggest private bank.</i>

10:02.268 --> 10:06.731
<i>They say he's Kim Jong-Un's</i>
<i>nephew or cousin.</i>

10:06.814 --> 10:08.024
<i>Nobody really asks.</i>

10:09.317 --> 10:12.737
<i>Suzanne Grosvenor,</i>
<i>Lead Banker at Duncan-Welsh.</i>

10:13.988 --> 10:16.324
<i>Word is the Queen's got her on speed dial.</i>

10:17.617 --> 10:20.536
<i>And Stefan Thiele,</i>

10:21.454 --> 10:23.789
<i>Swiss CEO of Banque Brünner,</i>

10:23.873 --> 10:26.751
<i>started by</i>
<i>his great-great-grandfather in 1898.</i>

10:26.834 --> 10:31.005
<i>Let's just say that their gold</i>
<i>might still have a swastika or two on it.</i>

10:32.340 --> 10:36.510
<i>Between them,</i>
<i>they control half a trillion dollars.</i>

10:37.845 --> 10:39.639
Most of their money's in Europe.

10:40.514 --> 10:41.849
But a few years back,

10:42.683 --> 10:46.187
they took control of a fortune
in unsecured bearer bonds.

10:47.188 --> 10:48.481
Like the <i>Die Hard</i> thing?

10:48.564 --> 10:50.733
Yeah. The <i>Die Hard</i> thing.

10:51.442 --> 10:54.320
With unsecured bonds,
you can't track who owns them.

10:54.403 --> 10:57.740
Which is why people used to use them
for all sorts of illegal shit.

10:57.823 --> 11:02.495
So in 1982, the US government
stepped in and said,

11:02.578 --> 11:04.664
"All bonds got to be registered."

11:04.747 --> 11:09.043
But the pre-'82 bonds that are
still stranded out there in the wild,

11:09.794 --> 11:13.631
they can still be cashed in,
and that is what The Triplets have.

11:14.965 --> 11:17.802
About $7 billion worth.

11:18.678 --> 11:20.554
And they're all down in that vault?

11:20.638 --> 11:22.765
Not yet. They're coming in from Europe.

11:22.848 --> 11:26.894
The Triplets made a deal with the guy
who owns the vault to put them down there.

11:26.977 --> 11:32.566
He guarantees that it's weatherproof,
shockproof, and thief-proof.

11:34.819 --> 11:35.653
Yeah.

11:36.362 --> 11:38.531
In a couple of months,
we're gonna break in,

11:38.614 --> 11:40.658
and take him for everything he's got.

11:41.617 --> 11:42.535
Who's the mark?

11:43.661 --> 11:45.162
<i>Roger Salas.</i>

11:49.333 --> 11:50.167
Okay.

11:52.336 --> 11:53.838
Settle down, everyone.

11:54.588 --> 11:56.924
So it's a big win for the team.

11:57.508 --> 11:58.801
Let's hear it for Hannah,

11:58.884 --> 12:01.846
who did some,
uh, pretty special work for us.

12:02.513 --> 12:06.684
Now, we keep The Triplets happy,
the rest of the town falls into line.

12:06.767 --> 12:08.728
-Screw it up, we're working at Panera.

12:08.811 --> 12:12.356
Carlos will do Level 4 background checks
on all key personnel.

12:12.440 --> 12:16.235
Andrew's team will handle audits
of security protocols.

12:16.318 --> 12:18.195
Anything feels amiss, you come to me.

12:18.279 --> 12:20.281
This is rubber meets the road.

12:20.364 --> 12:21.991
Either we rise or we fall.

12:22.074 --> 12:23.159
Guys.

12:24.243 --> 12:25.619
Hannah, take app vulnerability.

12:25.703 --> 12:28.330
-Rajiv, source code review.
-Piece of cake, boss man.

12:29.415 --> 12:30.458
<i>What do you think?</i>

12:30.541 --> 12:32.001
<i>It's still impossible.</i>

12:32.710 --> 12:35.463
<i>I mean, maybe with somebody</i>
<i>on the inside. Maybe.</i>

12:36.046 --> 12:37.673
Let's assume I got that covered.

12:39.467 --> 12:41.051
Can you source the gear?

12:41.135 --> 12:43.888
Job like this comes to what, like…

12:45.514 --> 12:47.266
half a million in seed money?

12:47.892 --> 12:48.726
You pull that?

12:48.809 --> 12:52.521
Yeah. I got a guy who works security
for OTB in Garden City.

12:52.605 --> 12:54.356
We cut him in,
he'll make it an easy score.

12:54.440 --> 12:56.817
-So we do a job to do a job.
-Yeah.

13:00.946 --> 13:03.282
Not for nothing, man, but…

13:04.742 --> 13:09.705
You never cared about cars,
or yachts, or whatever.

13:11.207 --> 13:12.416
Why chance it?

13:13.209 --> 13:16.378
Are you confused by a billion dollars?

13:16.462 --> 13:18.130
Big win is a big risk.

13:18.714 --> 13:22.468
We got a chance to fix everything
that ever went wrong in our lives.

13:22.551 --> 13:26.430
Look, the way I see it,
all it takes is you, me, a driver,

13:27.097 --> 13:31.310
a forger, security, and maybe a chemist.

13:50.329 --> 13:53.374
If you could, just pick the one
you saw run out of the depot.

13:53.457 --> 13:55.668
I mean, that's a little tricky.

13:55.751 --> 13:59.338
They're all sort of equally flea-ridden,
you know?

13:59.421 --> 14:00.631
Um…

14:00.714 --> 14:02.633
Though I did hear him speak,

14:02.716 --> 14:04.301
Um, I believe he said,

14:04.385 --> 14:06.637
you'll have to excuse my French, um,

14:06.720 --> 14:08.472
"I'm a fucking moron."

14:09.181 --> 14:12.059
Perhaps you could instruct the gentlemen
to say that and I could…

14:14.937 --> 14:18.148
We're going to have you all say,
"I'm a fucking moron."

14:18.232 --> 14:20.359
-Number one?
-Thank you.

14:21.026 --> 14:22.444
I'm a fucking moron.

14:26.699 --> 14:27.575
Number two.

14:28.617 --> 14:30.703
I'm a moron. Fucking moron.

14:32.288 --> 14:33.831
No. Maybe the next one?

14:35.833 --> 14:37.042
Number three?

14:38.085 --> 14:39.086
I'm a fucking moron.

14:39.169 --> 14:42.047
Oh, that was a little fast,
wasn't it? Uh, may I?

14:42.923 --> 14:46.802
Number three, I'd love to really hear you
sell the idiocy.

14:46.886 --> 14:48.596
I want to know that you understand

14:48.679 --> 14:50.598
how irretrievably stupid it was of you

14:50.681 --> 14:53.017
to try to rob a FedEx depot
in broad daylight,

14:53.100 --> 14:56.061
that you should've listened to anyone
who tried to stop you

14:56.145 --> 14:58.272
and that you recognize your own ineptitude

14:58.355 --> 15:01.525
in a deep, meaningful, spiritual way.

15:09.033 --> 15:13.329
I am a fucking moron.

15:17.124 --> 15:19.293
No. Um, number four?

15:21.921 --> 15:22.755
Number four?

15:24.506 --> 15:27.051
I am a fucking moron.

15:33.349 --> 15:36.602
Maybe less
of a fucking idiot next time? Yeah?

15:36.685 --> 15:39.396
Next time you tell the cops
you don't recognize anyone.

15:39.480 --> 15:41.065
-Use your head.
-You know what?

15:41.148 --> 15:44.485
Next time I'll be sitting at home
swiping left on your calls from county.

15:44.568 --> 15:46.987
-You'll be swiping left on my calls…
-This is not…

15:47.988 --> 15:49.823
I can't fucking stand you, Bob.

15:51.909 --> 15:53.035
Come here.

15:58.791 --> 16:00.834
Give me a sec to have
a chinwag with these blokes.

16:01.502 --> 16:02.670
-Are you…
-A second.

16:04.463 --> 16:06.131
-Motherfucker. Yeah.
-I love you!

16:11.595 --> 16:12.680
Hey, Judy.

16:13.639 --> 16:14.556
Stan.

16:16.684 --> 16:17.601
You look amazing.

16:18.978 --> 16:19.812
You…

16:20.854 --> 16:23.816
Earring? It works.

16:26.777 --> 16:28.612
-It's been a while, huh?
-Yeah.

16:31.281 --> 16:33.492
I didn't want to leave things
the way we did…

16:33.575 --> 16:35.244
-It's okay.
-It's just that he…

16:35.327 --> 16:36.161
Really.

16:36.912 --> 16:39.123
-Uh…
-I mean, for a while, it was…

16:40.374 --> 16:42.668
But now it's just so good to see you.

16:42.751 --> 16:44.003
Wowee.

16:45.671 --> 16:47.339
Look who it is, eh?

16:48.173 --> 16:49.758
What a lovely surprise.

16:50.467 --> 16:52.052
Look, it's our old buddy, Stan.

16:52.136 --> 16:53.721
-Hey, Bob.
-Hey!

16:53.804 --> 16:55.681
Did you know Stan was gonna be here?

16:55.764 --> 16:56.890
-I didn't know…
-She didn't.

16:56.974 --> 16:57.808
She didn't know.

16:57.891 --> 17:01.520
This is such a fun surprise
to have you here, mate. Eh?

17:01.603 --> 17:03.856
Especially after that conversation we had.

17:04.565 --> 17:07.609
You remember the one.
Where you should just stay in New York.

17:07.693 --> 17:10.654
And yet, here you are. Huh? What a treat.

17:10.738 --> 17:15.034
In Philly. In our town. My town.

17:15.117 --> 17:16.952
Okay. Yeah. What are you doing here?

17:17.036 --> 17:18.787
I got a guy who wants to see you.

17:19.580 --> 17:20.664
Do I know him?

17:21.874 --> 17:23.625
No, but you're going to want to.

17:30.424 --> 17:32.217
Sure, come along too, Bob.

17:34.678 --> 17:36.096
Dumb motherfucker.

17:42.269 --> 17:44.855
Way I figure it,
we'll need some lock burnouts.

17:45.689 --> 17:47.316
Maybe some gas for the guards.

17:47.399 --> 17:49.818
I've been playing
with some fentanyl derivatives.

17:52.029 --> 17:54.907
-What's the split?
-Even-steven, across the board.

17:54.990 --> 17:55.908
What about Bob?

17:57.201 --> 17:58.035
What about Bob?

17:59.244 --> 18:00.245
What can I get you?

18:00.329 --> 18:04.124
Oh, hey, Jenna. I actually had a question
about the pork chop.

18:04.208 --> 18:07.461
-Is it grass-fed or Niman Ranch--
-He'll have a burger. Same here.

18:08.587 --> 18:10.380
-No, I'm good.
-You're not gonna eat?

18:10.464 --> 18:12.341
-I don't eat lunch.
-What do you mean?

18:12.424 --> 18:13.634
One meal a day, mate.

18:14.593 --> 18:17.096
Keeps me sharp, you know, focused.

18:17.888 --> 18:19.723
Rockets up the testosterone, too.

18:20.390 --> 18:22.518
Well, today's meal is fucking lunch.

18:23.477 --> 18:25.062
Burgers, all around.

18:28.524 --> 18:31.360
Look, we're a package deal,
me and the wifey here, yeah?

18:31.443 --> 18:34.488
But you're in luck. Safes are my thing.
So, tell 'em, babe.

18:35.989 --> 18:37.074
He's very good.

18:37.157 --> 18:40.077
Thank you. But we're all set.
Leo's on safes.

18:40.160 --> 18:41.411
Who, Shamrock Shake?

18:41.954 --> 18:45.082
No offense, mate,
but, uh, would you hire you for this job?

18:45.165 --> 18:46.416
You have no fucking--

18:46.500 --> 18:49.294
That's going to be two shares.
One for her, one for me.

18:49.378 --> 18:51.964
None of this
community property bullshit, okay?

18:52.047 --> 18:54.091
Do your job, you'll get your cut.

18:55.551 --> 18:57.970
What about seed cash?
I'm going to need gear.

18:58.053 --> 19:00.848
Credit card skim I could set up.
Get us a pretty decent score.

19:00.931 --> 19:03.183
I got an OTB job set up for seed.

19:04.893 --> 19:06.478
How do we know you can pull this off?

19:06.562 --> 19:09.189
You don't. So you can stay here in Philly,

19:09.273 --> 19:11.441
pulling off dime jobs
and bailing out this asshole…

19:11.525 --> 19:12.651
Alleged asshole.

19:12.734 --> 19:16.405
…or take a long shot
that puts you on top for good.

19:22.161 --> 19:27.457
So this vault, you say there's biometrics,
uninterruptible power supplies…

19:27.541 --> 19:30.711
And ten other things that
we don't know about. It's a nightmare.

19:30.794 --> 19:32.671
Hell of a sales job, Leo.

19:34.464 --> 19:38.552
But ask yourself, how do I know
the things I do already know?

19:41.597 --> 19:42.931
You've got eyes inside.

19:48.478 --> 19:50.814
Someone
punched through our firewall.

19:50.898 --> 19:53.942
They used an app-suite whitelist
to gain access.

19:54.026 --> 19:55.444
I mean, smart, really.

19:56.528 --> 19:58.405
Could be a grey hat doing it for fun.

19:58.488 --> 20:00.824
Or The Triplets testing our system.

20:00.908 --> 20:03.911
I shuttered the ports
and set alerts in case they try again,

20:03.994 --> 20:06.288
and I'll let you know if anything pops up.

20:06.371 --> 20:09.249
Okay. No time's too late. And good work.

20:09.333 --> 20:10.292
Thank you.

20:10.375 --> 20:14.838
And, uh, that Junior VP position…

20:14.922 --> 20:18.675
We'll have a decision soon enough.
You just keep doing what you're doing.

20:19.259 --> 20:20.093
Okay.

20:25.474 --> 20:27.100
We have eyes on Andrew?

20:27.184 --> 20:29.436
We don't. But we can.

20:36.568 --> 20:38.987
It's not stress, because I'm not stressed.

20:39.071 --> 20:39.947
Clearly.

20:40.030 --> 20:41.448
There's just a lot going on.

20:41.531 --> 20:43.575
They're doing more background checks.

20:43.659 --> 20:45.786
So if you get a call, can you please just…

20:45.869 --> 20:48.121
Oh, I'll just tell them
you committed murder.

20:50.290 --> 20:52.542
No, just please be normal. Thank you.

20:52.626 --> 20:55.295
Okay, fine. But you are a thief.

20:55.379 --> 20:57.881
Hmm? T-shirt? Hot Topic?

20:57.965 --> 21:00.550
And <i>Eomma</i> still brings it up
like, all the time,

21:00.634 --> 21:03.011
which is just… Mwah! So yummy.

21:05.597 --> 21:06.556
Hey, stop it.

21:06.640 --> 21:07.641
Okay?

21:07.724 --> 21:10.727
-You stress me out too.
-I'm not stressed.

21:10.811 --> 21:12.604
You work
18 hours a day for fun?

21:12.688 --> 21:15.148
It's called a job, Liz.
You might want to try it.

21:15.232 --> 21:17.109
I have a job at The Collective.

21:17.192 --> 21:18.568
A job that pays money.

21:19.569 --> 21:20.988
Don't you wanna DJ in Berlin?

21:21.071 --> 21:23.573
An immersive musical
movement experience. Okay?

21:23.657 --> 21:25.784
I'm not gonna explain
the difference again.

21:25.867 --> 21:28.412
Okay, that takes capital nonetheless,

21:28.495 --> 21:31.039
so I can get you a job at the office.

21:31.123 --> 21:33.333
You can put down some real money
and save up.

21:41.550 --> 21:42.384
Well?

21:46.471 --> 21:47.431
Whoa.

21:47.514 --> 21:50.684
Stress? Now, I'm stressed.

22:02.154 --> 22:03.488
There's three of them now.

22:03.572 --> 22:06.992
-Yeah, I know. It's a handful.

22:07.075 --> 22:09.995
Half the time
they're either fucking or fighting.

22:10.078 --> 22:11.371
You allow that?

22:11.955 --> 22:13.248
Why fight nature?

22:16.293 --> 22:19.171
So Salas make the deal?

22:19.880 --> 22:21.214
-About a month from now.
-Mm-hm.

22:21.298 --> 22:23.508
Triplets will be
moving their bonds to SLS.

22:24.926 --> 22:28.013
We need top people
at every position to pull it off.

22:28.597 --> 22:30.265
I just need you to get documents.

22:31.141 --> 22:35.812
Okay. I'll get docs,
set up shell companies,

22:35.896 --> 22:37.356
fence the take.

22:39.191 --> 22:40.984
And I can handle security.

22:43.904 --> 22:46.031
I don't know
if this is your speed.

22:47.324 --> 22:48.992
You want to see something cool?

22:51.661 --> 22:53.413
You want to see something cool.

22:53.497 --> 22:54.331
Come on.

22:55.290 --> 22:56.875
Hey, guys. Let's go.

23:22.818 --> 23:23.652
Wow.

23:24.820 --> 23:25.862
The armory.

23:28.281 --> 23:29.699
You're pretty well-stocked.

23:29.783 --> 23:30.700
Mm-hm.

23:31.410 --> 23:32.619
Hmm.

23:32.702 --> 23:35.455
-We look with our eyes, Leo.
-Uh-huh.

23:37.541 --> 23:40.168
-How many of these are registered?
-Under whose name?

23:41.294 --> 23:42.754
I'm not looking to go in hot.

23:42.838 --> 23:44.464
Of course. Nobody is.

23:45.382 --> 23:50.554
But success is 90% preparation
and 10% ammunition.

23:51.346 --> 23:54.850
Hey, I can outfit the entire crew.

23:57.769 --> 23:59.187
Why do you want to do this?

24:03.275 --> 24:04.109
Why do you?

24:07.696 --> 24:08.989
Bucket list.

24:09.948 --> 24:11.116
A billion dollars.

24:12.742 --> 24:16.079
And a 25-year-old IOU.

24:16.830 --> 24:17.914
Then we'll be square.

24:19.291 --> 24:20.167
We'll be even.

24:23.128 --> 24:24.713
We're gonna need a driver.

24:24.796 --> 24:27.591
-Teddy G got busted last November.
-Okay.

24:27.674 --> 24:30.093
What about
that guy with the, uh, birthmark?

24:30.635 --> 24:31.636
-Clyde?
-Yeah.

24:32.137 --> 24:34.222
-Stage four liver cancer.
-Shit.

24:34.306 --> 24:36.475
-Mm. Yeah.
-Gav Bentley?

24:37.976 --> 24:38.894
Found God.

24:38.977 --> 24:40.520
-Bastard.

24:40.604 --> 24:42.147
-Hallelujah.
-Yeah.

24:44.983 --> 24:47.861
-Um…
-How do you feel about repetitive banging?

24:51.114 --> 24:51.990
Hmm.

25:00.248 --> 25:02.000
How long does he go on for?

25:02.083 --> 25:03.752
Uh, he'll stop if you tell him.

25:04.461 --> 25:05.295
For a bit.

25:06.254 --> 25:09.007
He's a good kid. Works around the shop.

25:09.883 --> 25:11.635
I let him live in the trailer.

25:11.718 --> 25:14.179
Knows his cars, knows his tech.

25:15.138 --> 25:16.473
And you trust him?

25:16.556 --> 25:19.559
I've put him into some jobs.
He'll hold up.

25:24.189 --> 25:25.065
Hmm.

25:32.489 --> 25:35.408
-Oh, shit, sorry. Hey. Uh, whoa.

25:35.909 --> 25:39.412
Hi, my boss isn't here…
isn't here right now,

25:39.496 --> 25:43.166
but, um, if you could maybe
just come… come back at another time, I--

25:43.250 --> 25:45.544
-Settle down, kid. She's with me.
-Oh.

25:46.419 --> 25:47.921
Cool. Hey, Leo. Uh, hi.

25:48.004 --> 25:51.800
Leo tells me you can drive.
Can you drive, RJ?

25:52.425 --> 25:54.135
Yeah, of course, I can drive.

25:54.219 --> 25:57.305
No, but can you <i>drive?</i>

26:02.769 --> 26:06.273
Grew up racing 450s at Millville.
Haven't lost since I was 12.

26:06.356 --> 26:08.108
What about four wheels?

26:08.191 --> 26:11.194
Cars, trucks, ATVs, what… whatever.

26:11.778 --> 26:14.406
How about a van with custom suspension?

26:15.031 --> 26:16.116
Yeah, sure.

26:16.199 --> 26:19.536
How about a van with custom suspension,

26:19.619 --> 26:22.998
overload bump stops, going 90,

26:23.081 --> 26:26.543
loaded up with 4,000 pounds
of loose cargo?

26:27.502 --> 26:28.670
Hmm?

26:30.714 --> 26:32.549
What the hell are you guys planning?

26:33.425 --> 26:35.510
Well, that's a big old clusterfuck.

26:36.386 --> 26:38.346
There's no such thing
as an unbeatable vault.

26:38.430 --> 26:39.556
Never mind the vault,

26:39.639 --> 26:42.267
it's the shit before the vault
we got to worry about.

26:42.350 --> 26:46.104
And the angry men with guns
who don't like when you get too close.

26:47.731 --> 26:49.566
Is anyone gonna tell this kid to shut up

26:49.649 --> 26:51.234
'cause I'd love to have a crack at it.

26:51.318 --> 26:53.153
Just let him be, man. He's thinking.

26:53.737 --> 26:54.571
Hey!

26:56.197 --> 26:58.283
What's the RJ stand for?

26:59.075 --> 27:00.535
Oh, it's, uh, it's Roy Jr.

27:00.619 --> 27:03.079
Your name's Roy Jr. Jr.?

27:03.580 --> 27:05.874
Oh, yes.
It's really nice to meet everyone.

27:05.957 --> 27:08.001
Seems like a nice group, um, and…

27:08.084 --> 27:09.169
Um…

27:09.836 --> 27:11.254
Why is this guy here?

27:11.338 --> 27:13.298
I ask myself the same thing every day.

27:13.381 --> 27:16.134
I'm here to get you inside the vault.
Why are you here?

27:16.968 --> 27:19.804
To keep us from ending up inside a cage.

27:19.888 --> 27:21.097
Where you belong.

27:21.181 --> 27:23.725
Ooh.

27:23.808 --> 27:24.726
Really?

27:24.809 --> 27:26.686
-Bob.
-My God.

27:26.770 --> 27:27.604
Oof.

27:28.438 --> 27:29.564
Salas is arrogant.

27:30.398 --> 27:32.859
He thinks money and technology
will protect him.

27:32.942 --> 27:34.110
That's our in.

27:35.111 --> 27:37.864
He goes high-tech, we go low.

27:37.947 --> 27:41.993
Okay, I'm gonna need a full raft of acids.
Yeah? Aqua regia, Caro's…

27:42.077 --> 27:43.620
You got a list, I'll be your Santa.

27:44.496 --> 27:47.874
Santa? Okay, cool. So, uh,
what's, what's your protocol, Santa?

27:47.957 --> 27:49.125
Do I have to sit on your lap?

27:49.209 --> 27:52.420
-What? No, I mean…

27:53.338 --> 27:55.173
He makes little kids sit on his lap,

27:55.256 --> 27:57.258
but he doesn't make them, 'cause that…

27:57.342 --> 28:01.054
Hey, Santa, how about you worry
about getting me a couple practice safes?

28:03.556 --> 28:04.474
What else?

28:04.557 --> 28:06.810
We'll need cash. A lot of it.

28:06.893 --> 28:08.103
Well, that's easy.

28:08.186 --> 28:09.979
I was talking to my mate Taco yesterday.

28:10.063 --> 28:13.441
Do you guys know
if you slip and fall in a Wawa,

28:13.525 --> 28:14.859
you can get, like, 20K?

28:21.866 --> 28:23.576
-What?
-Hey…

28:23.660 --> 28:24.703
Oh, fuck off.

28:25.286 --> 28:27.997
Everybody make your lists.
We'll take it from there.

28:34.587 --> 28:37.173
Hey, Roger. Do you have a second?

28:37.257 --> 28:38.174
Sure.

28:38.258 --> 28:40.218
I was investigating the security breach

28:40.301 --> 28:43.596
and it looks like
it happened locally in the office.

28:44.431 --> 28:46.766
-Someone who works here?
-Would've shown up in the logs.

28:46.850 --> 28:48.810
But what if someone
adjusted the whitelist data?

28:49.394 --> 28:51.312
You've got a lot of other work to do.

28:51.396 --> 28:53.857
Stay on it, go with your gut.

28:59.154 --> 29:01.072
Does Andrew seem weird today?

29:01.156 --> 29:02.991
No, he's just a dick.

29:06.161 --> 29:07.162
<i>Don't be a dick.</i>

29:07.245 --> 29:08.747
So what do you want me to say?

29:08.830 --> 29:11.708
It was a waste, he got sued for it.
What's the big deal?

29:11.791 --> 29:13.168
What are you talking about?

29:13.251 --> 29:15.128
No one asked him to write it!

29:16.004 --> 29:19.132
-Uh, it's a classic, all right?
<i>-E.T.</i> already had a theme song.

29:19.215 --> 29:21.468
If Neil Diamond
wants to write a theme song,

29:21.551 --> 29:23.470
you take that theme song. Back me up here.

29:23.553 --> 29:26.473
All right, all right,
everybody just settle down.

29:26.556 --> 29:29.851
Where are we on the lists?
What's the number all in?

29:30.435 --> 29:34.147
It's 350K.
A lot to come up with on short notice.

29:38.443 --> 29:39.778
Who's feeling lucky?

29:43.031 --> 29:47.035
<i>Any given day, Garden City Off-Track</i>
<i>Betting takes in about $3 million.</i>

29:47.118 --> 29:48.578
<i>Most of that goes back out.</i>

29:48.661 --> 29:52.165
<i>But the security office</i>
<i>holds a million in reserve at all times.</i>

29:52.248 --> 29:54.459
<i>And I know an easy way in.</i>

29:54.542 --> 29:56.169
<i>There's five parts to the plan.</i>

29:57.003 --> 29:59.005
We'll have to find
that money elsewhere.

29:59.088 --> 30:00.882
Ain't that a bitch.

30:00.965 --> 30:03.176
What the fuck is the world coming to?

30:03.259 --> 30:07.180
If we go bare bones,
I can maybe get the list to 300K?

30:07.263 --> 30:09.265
Nobody's going to front us that money.

30:09.349 --> 30:10.725
-Ava?
-No.

30:10.809 --> 30:14.103
I'm not that liquid. Couple months?

30:14.771 --> 30:16.147
We don't have that kind of time.

30:19.359 --> 30:23.321
So we're going to leave behind $7 billion
'cause we can't raise a quick 300K?

30:23.404 --> 30:24.531
It looks that way.

30:27.867 --> 30:29.577
Well, there's always Diamond Way.

30:33.456 --> 30:35.375
Oh, so now you fuckwits are all ears.

30:37.877 --> 30:40.547
<i>Ninety percent of all diamonds</i>
<i>entering the States</i>

30:40.630 --> 30:43.424
<i>come in at 47th Street</i>
<i>between Fifth and Sixth Avenue.</i>

30:43.925 --> 30:46.010
<i>They call it Diamond Way.</i>

30:46.094 --> 30:47.804
<i>It kicked off during World War II</i>

30:47.887 --> 30:49.597
<i>when the Jews got out of Amsterdam</i>

30:49.681 --> 30:51.516
<i>and brought the business to Midtown.</i>

30:52.225 --> 30:56.312
<i>These days it's Russians,</i>
<i>Hasids, Israelis, South Asians.</i>

30:58.940 --> 31:02.694
<i>Twenty-four billion in revenue a year,</i>
<i>and the balls to back it up.</i>

31:06.281 --> 31:08.616
<i>There's 4,000 security cameras</i>
<i>on street level.</i>

31:10.034 --> 31:13.496
<i>Not to mention, the undercover security</i>
<i>trying to front as tourists.</i>

31:13.580 --> 31:15.915
None of this sounds low-profile.

31:15.999 --> 31:18.877
Well, chief, sometimes you got
to break a few eggs.

31:28.136 --> 31:29.137
Mm!

31:30.138 --> 31:31.514
Fuck, this is good chicken.

31:31.598 --> 31:35.143
<i>It's the white sauce.</i>
<i>Trade secret. Special ingredient is sumac.</i>

31:35.226 --> 31:37.645
Did you just explain
sumac to me, white boy?

31:37.729 --> 31:38.897
Mm.

31:38.980 --> 31:40.315
<i>Eyes on the guards?</i>

31:40.815 --> 31:45.361
Red shirt, not even trying.
Gray jacket, ten feet down.

31:48.406 --> 31:49.407
<i>On the other side?</i>

31:51.409 --> 31:55.038
My guy is standing with his hands
in his pockets, totally chill.

31:55.121 --> 31:56.664
That's how chill people stand.

31:57.332 --> 32:00.710
And his friend's window shopping
with his whole back. That's normal.

32:03.922 --> 32:05.590
Are we sure this is gonna work?

32:05.673 --> 32:07.592
<i>Only one way to find out.</i>

32:15.642 --> 32:19.479
<i>Okay, guys, stick to the plan.</i>
<i>Get in. Get out.</i>

32:19.562 --> 32:20.772
Here goes nothing.

32:54.472 --> 32:56.641
Ninety seconds. Go. Now.

33:15.576 --> 33:17.578
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

33:20.915 --> 33:22.083
<i>Seventy seconds!</i>

33:30.341 --> 33:32.176
Setting up the charges.

33:33.261 --> 33:34.178
Clear!

33:36.639 --> 33:38.057
Clear!

33:46.983 --> 33:48.067
<i>Thirty seconds!</i>

33:54.073 --> 33:55.241
Ten seconds!

33:58.327 --> 33:59.704
Time's up. Everybody out.

33:59.787 --> 34:04.125
Come on. We're done here.
Let's go! Come on, let's go! Come on!

34:04.208 --> 34:05.835
Just give me one fucking second.

34:05.918 --> 34:07.837
<i>Bob. Listen to him. Get out.</i>

34:07.920 --> 34:11.174
<i>Bob! We have</i>
<i>what we came for. Let's go, let's--</i>

34:11.841 --> 34:13.634
-Let's go.
-I got him.

34:13.718 --> 34:15.678
-Stan! Stan!
-I got him.

34:27.273 --> 34:30.026
Come on! We gotta go!
We gotta go! Come on, let's go!

34:30.109 --> 34:31.360
Don't you ever touch me!

34:38.576 --> 34:40.119
-He's there!
-Hold it right there!

34:48.586 --> 34:49.879
Stan, let's leave now!

34:53.466 --> 34:55.384
<i>Hey, this is RJ, I'm heading up Sixth.</i>

35:00.139 --> 35:04.185
<i>Guys, I'm pulling over on 47th.</i>
<i>Can't stay here much longer, guys.</i>

35:05.812 --> 35:08.106
Okay, we're heading into
the subway underpass.

35:08.189 --> 35:09.524
See you on the other side.

35:11.901 --> 35:13.277
Come on, come on.

35:15.363 --> 35:17.532
-They're here!
-Come on!

35:17.615 --> 35:19.242
Let's go! Let's go, come on!

35:19.826 --> 35:22.411
-Come on! Come on! Get in!

35:22.495 --> 35:24.664
-Get in! Move it!

35:24.747 --> 35:26.624
-Come on!
-Baby, come on!

35:26.707 --> 35:28.084
Shit, Bob! Fuck!

35:41.556 --> 35:43.641
He still hasn't answered.

35:43.724 --> 35:45.560
Better not
to have that bastard.

35:46.269 --> 35:49.188
There's a reason
it only lasted a few weeks, right?

35:49.272 --> 35:52.400
It would be nice if he had
an ounce of interest in his child.

35:54.277 --> 35:55.278
So, are you…

35:56.654 --> 35:57.655
going to give birth?

35:58.239 --> 35:59.574
I don't know…

36:00.992 --> 36:02.660
Everything would have to change,

36:02.743 --> 36:05.913
like, a different job, a different life.

36:07.456 --> 36:08.791
Somewhere calm.

36:08.875 --> 36:11.085
<i>We're getting breaking news.</i>

36:11.169 --> 36:14.964
<i>Shots were fired and smoke grenades</i>
<i>were set off in the Diamond District</i>

36:15.047 --> 36:17.800
<i>on 47th Street in Midtown Manhattan,</i>

36:17.884 --> 36:18.968
<i>where a brazen…</i>

36:19.051 --> 36:23.097
That's the right way
to make money.

36:23.181 --> 36:25.016
How about a decent job?

36:26.058 --> 36:27.560
Make a decision on that?

36:28.269 --> 36:30.897
Baby mama's going to be
lecturing me about decisions?

36:31.439 --> 36:33.441
-Is that what's happening here?
-Okay.

36:33.524 --> 36:34.650
-Yeesh!
-Hey!

36:34.734 --> 36:35.776
No, no, no!

36:38.821 --> 36:40.781
I've got it. Got it, I've got it.

36:40.865 --> 36:41.741
Yeah!

36:43.117 --> 36:44.452
Vicodin.

36:44.535 --> 36:47.830
-How we looking?
-Solid. Real solid. Separate it out…

36:47.914 --> 36:49.457
-God, are those tendons?
-Yeah.

36:49.540 --> 36:51.083
I bet they're tendons.

36:51.167 --> 36:52.168
Can you make a fist?

36:52.251 --> 36:54.337
What do you think?
You think I can make a fist?

36:54.921 --> 36:56.297
Not much more I can do.

36:56.380 --> 36:58.299
You said you knew what you were doing!

36:58.382 --> 36:59.592
You want to do it? You do it!

36:59.675 --> 37:01.302
I never said I was a hand surgeon!

37:01.385 --> 37:04.805
We wouldn't be in this position
if he hadn't been such a greedy fuck.

37:04.889 --> 37:07.725
Dollar, dollar bill, y'all!

37:07.808 --> 37:08.643
Ah! Fuck!

37:08.726 --> 37:11.979
-Can he crack a safe with one hand?
-That's the $7 billion question.

37:12.063 --> 37:13.147
Mm-hm.

37:15.983 --> 37:17.068
Ta-da.

37:17.151 --> 37:19.278
You want me to post up here?

37:19.362 --> 37:20.988
"Oh, my God! Thank you, Hannah."

37:21.072 --> 37:23.658
"This is so great.
It's a life-changing opportunity."

37:23.741 --> 37:25.368
Okay. I don't talk like that.

37:25.451 --> 37:27.245
Sort the mail.

37:27.328 --> 37:29.747
Bring any high-volume print documents
down to the office…

37:29.830 --> 37:32.875
So I'm moving paper.
I'm like a paper mover?

37:32.959 --> 37:36.504
That's… that's what's happening.
It's also loud as hell in here.

37:38.547 --> 37:40.508
-Here's your start gift.
-Ooh!

37:41.467 --> 37:43.511
These are the Pros. Okay.

37:45.179 --> 37:46.806
-Oh, my God. Cool.
-Mm.

37:51.978 --> 37:54.146
<i>Hey. Roger wants to see you.</i>

37:57.441 --> 37:58.276
Gotta go.

37:58.693 --> 38:00.361
-I love you.
-I love you.

38:03.864 --> 38:05.616
I'm gonna put this up in 3A.

38:07.493 --> 38:08.494
Good luck.

38:11.706 --> 38:15.918
Okay, no sense beating around the bush.
Rajiv, congratulations.

38:16.002 --> 38:18.337
Hannah, you'll now report to Rajiv.

38:18.421 --> 38:23.301
Now, your first task as Junior VP
is to tell me about rubber duckies.

38:23.384 --> 38:28.431
It's an injectable keyboard.
Usually planted into a USB drive.

38:28.514 --> 38:29.557
What's it used for?

38:29.640 --> 38:32.768
To execute commands automatically
wherever it's plugged in?

38:32.852 --> 38:36.439
Correct. And one of them
was used to pull data off our servers.

38:36.522 --> 38:38.482
We traced the IPv6, cross-referenced it

38:38.566 --> 38:40.151
with the MAC address you found,

38:40.234 --> 38:41.944
the source of the leak that you located.

38:42.028 --> 38:44.280
Rajiv, do you find it interesting
that Hannah,

38:44.363 --> 38:46.741
who is a security penetration expert,

38:46.824 --> 38:48.409
raised the red flag on a device

38:48.492 --> 38:50.619
that she'd be in a position
to program and use?

38:51.203 --> 38:54.457
Now keep in mind you're now her supervisor
so answer accordingly.

38:55.833 --> 38:56.709
Uh, yes?

38:56.792 --> 38:59.086
And yet you were dismissive
of her concerns.

38:59.170 --> 39:02.340
Oh, no. I… I just felt that
caution…

39:02.423 --> 39:03.966
Rajiv couldn't have been involved.

39:04.050 --> 39:05.092
Oh, I'm aware.

39:06.510 --> 39:08.763
I've had Carlos watching you both
for the last week.

39:09.513 --> 39:12.266
What we did is,
we put a poison pill inside the data.

39:12.350 --> 39:14.685
That way,
anyone tried to take anything out,

39:14.769 --> 39:17.396
it'd automatically be back-traced,
and that way we got a name.

39:17.980 --> 39:20.566
I got Carlos
to do a search of the suspect's office.

39:25.988 --> 39:27.073
Empty your bag.

39:28.491 --> 39:31.202
What? I don't understand.

39:32.036 --> 39:33.913
This is ridiculous.

39:34.497 --> 39:36.999
Uh, yep, fine, here.

39:40.252 --> 39:42.129
I don't know what you expect to find.

40:01.107 --> 40:02.608
I've never seen that before.

40:06.362 --> 40:08.823
Your desk is packed,
your belongings are in the lobby.

40:08.906 --> 40:12.159
No, I swear,
I had nothing to do with this.

40:12.243 --> 40:14.078
Hannah, tell them. Rajiv…

40:14.161 --> 40:17.039
We'll tell that
you left to spend time with your family.

40:17.123 --> 40:20.668
You say one word to anyone
about infiltrating our system,

40:21.210 --> 40:23.587
and I'll ruin the lives
of anyone you looked at.

40:31.887 --> 40:35.349
Hannah, a word. Close the door.

40:40.312 --> 40:43.357
-Hell of a week, huh?
-Uh, Andrew, I… I…

40:43.441 --> 40:44.859
Relax, Hannah. Breathe.

40:46.360 --> 40:48.154
How long have we been working together?

40:48.237 --> 40:49.864
Uh, almost eight years?

40:49.947 --> 40:53.951
Well, I think it's about time
for some new responsibilities.

40:54.660 --> 40:56.412
Didn't Rajiv just get the job?

40:56.495 --> 40:58.247
Yeah, as Junior VP.

40:58.330 --> 41:00.291
Now Andrew's gone,
we need a new Senior VP.

41:00.374 --> 41:01.459
Someone I can trust.

41:02.126 --> 41:03.377
Do you not want the job?

41:03.461 --> 41:06.464
No, I… Yes. Yes, I do.

41:06.547 --> 41:09.508
Pregnancy is not an issue.
Not for me. Unless it is for you.

41:11.552 --> 41:12.761
You switched to decaf.

41:13.679 --> 41:15.556
Sakura did the same when she was pregnant.

41:16.765 --> 41:17.808
Um…

41:17.892 --> 41:20.811
No, it will not affect anything.

41:20.895 --> 41:22.229
Family affects everything.

41:22.313 --> 41:24.398
Make sure it doesn't cloud your judgment.

41:24.899 --> 41:27.776
I'll have Carlos set you up
with a new security clearance.

41:28.903 --> 41:29.862
Thank you, Roger.

41:59.308 --> 42:00.684
Looks smaller every time.

42:02.186 --> 42:04.813
And the days go by faster and faster.

42:06.148 --> 42:07.149
Walk with me.

42:09.735 --> 42:11.362
-What's their story?
-Don't.

42:11.445 --> 42:14.949
Oh, come on. You used to love it.
You used to practically beg me--

42:15.032 --> 42:18.494
I'm in. Senior VP.

42:20.704 --> 42:23.707
I can get photos and key cards,
but I won't have full access.

42:24.291 --> 42:25.125
Not a concern.

42:25.709 --> 42:29.088
I can't get alarm specs or the key,
or temperature codes.

42:29.588 --> 42:32.174
-Roger keeps that to himself.
-We got the back door.

42:32.258 --> 42:34.552
You're in the right place
at the right time.

42:35.761 --> 42:38.305
-The timing's wrong.
-No, it's our only shot.

42:38.389 --> 42:39.974
You know whose bonds these are?

42:40.057 --> 42:41.976
There's no sense
in stealing from the poor.

42:42.726 --> 42:45.104
The Triplets aren't people
you can take their stuff

42:45.187 --> 42:46.397
and walk into the night.

42:46.480 --> 42:49.149
They'll find you. They'll kill you.

42:49.817 --> 42:51.569
I'm pretty good at not being found.

42:53.821 --> 42:57.157
Let's say you pull it off
and somehow don't end up dead. Then what?

42:57.241 --> 42:58.492
World's a better place.

42:59.493 --> 43:02.162
-I almost think you believe that.
-What's not to believe?

43:02.246 --> 43:04.290
Roger goes down, SLS collapses…

43:04.373 --> 43:06.750
-That's the idea.
-…along with my career.

43:07.751 --> 43:09.044
I'm not like you. I…

43:09.587 --> 43:12.464
How's it look if the vault gets cracked
after I take the job?

43:12.548 --> 43:13.632
You'll be rich.

43:19.513 --> 43:20.764
I could stop you.

43:22.725 --> 43:23.851
I know your plans.

43:23.934 --> 43:25.894
This ain't about my plans.

43:26.645 --> 43:28.439
This is about our plans.

43:28.522 --> 43:29.565
-Oh.
-Yeah, no, look.

43:29.648 --> 43:32.192
Seven years we've been talking this up.

43:32.276 --> 43:34.445
Seven years, and you don't say boo,

43:34.528 --> 43:37.197
and now we get right here,
right on the edge, and you…

43:40.826 --> 43:43.912
If there is something else going on,
something I need to know…

43:47.082 --> 43:47.916
Mm-mm.

43:48.792 --> 43:49.877
You're doing this.

43:50.878 --> 43:53.172
No, we're doing this.

44:56.026 --> 44:58.070
<i>Loyalty is worthless.</i>

44:58.779 --> 45:00.155
<i>Faith is dead.</i>

45:01.240 --> 45:04.952
<i>At the end of the day,</i>
<i>it will always come down to you</i>

45:05.536 --> 45:07.996
<i>versus the people who want what you have.</i>

45:09.164 --> 45:11.041
<i>And the only thing that matters is…</i>

45:12.334 --> 45:16.964
<i>can you manipulate them</i>
<i>better than they can manipulate you?</i>
