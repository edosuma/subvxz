00:00.648 --> 00:02.215
<i>Previously, on "The Village"...</i>

00:02.252 --> 00:03.338
<i>14 weeks.</i>

00:03.375 --> 00:06.221
How could she possibly
not know until 14 weeks?

00:06.258 --> 00:07.468
- <i>Look at me!</i>
- <i>I don't know</i>

00:07.505 --> 00:08.640
who I'm looking at!

00:08.677 --> 00:09.773
Who's the guy?

00:09.810 --> 00:10.984
Well, have you told him?

00:11.062 --> 00:13.062
Let me guess.
Your mom thinks it's a bad idea.

00:13.152 --> 00:14.886
Please don't conflate this with us.

00:14.953 --> 00:16.200
I mean, you didn't tell me.

00:16.235 --> 00:18.396
- It wouldn't have made a difference.
- <i>You don't know that.</i>

00:18.439 --> 00:20.085
- Anything else?
- Nope.

00:20.188 --> 00:21.883
Are you asking me out?

00:21.920 --> 00:23.141
I need to look like I'm not

00:23.175 --> 00:24.624
catastrophically single tonight.

00:24.663 --> 00:26.756
She's legal.
I know her, she's my neighbor.

00:26.793 --> 00:29.728
My ex-husband arranged
for the translator.

00:29.915 --> 00:31.382
He could have been saying anything.

00:31.417 --> 00:34.014
Bond is granted and set
in the amount of $10,000.

00:34.176 --> 00:35.609
Patricia, what is it?

00:35.694 --> 00:37.528
The cancer's back, Ron.

00:37.790 --> 00:39.874
You made a mistake.
It's what got Cooper killed.

00:39.935 --> 00:41.227
The hell are you talking about?

00:41.293 --> 00:42.967
<i>I don't want to live there, Gabe-y.</i>

00:43.048 --> 00:45.816
<i>Well, what's the alternative?</i>

00:53.296 --> 00:54.763
Oh...

01:01.068 --> 01:03.056
Ugh, I fell asleep.

01:03.372 --> 01:05.272
You fell a lot.

01:05.308 --> 01:07.576
The couch was just the
final landing spot.

01:08.131 --> 01:10.512
- I drank all that?
- Rushed it like a sorority.

01:10.741 --> 01:12.347
Ugh...

01:12.491 --> 01:14.683
Oh, God, my daughter's
going to think I had sex.

01:16.426 --> 01:18.861
- Did I have sex?
- Uh, no. No.

01:19.874 --> 01:21.556
- What time is it?
- 6:30.

01:21.591 --> 01:23.178
Oh, okay. She's still asleep.

01:23.215 --> 01:24.584
No school today or...

01:24.639 --> 01:26.795
Um, she was suspended.

01:26.829 --> 01:28.196
- Oh.
- I have to go.

01:28.231 --> 01:31.867
I'm so sorry.
Those look delicious and...

01:31.901 --> 01:34.202
- and this was fun, I think.
- No, it was.

01:34.237 --> 01:36.071
Maybe you can tell
me about it sometime?

01:36.249 --> 01:38.118
Any time in particular?

01:38.472 --> 01:40.710
Um, tonight. There's a thing.

01:40.843 --> 01:43.250
- I can text you?
- I'd like that.

01:43.746 --> 01:47.082
Oh, wait, wait, wait. You forgot this.

01:47.280 --> 01:49.548
- Thank you.
- And, uh, this.

01:50.586 --> 01:51.991
And this.

01:54.423 --> 01:56.725
- I can't.
- Cleared for takeoff.

01:56.759 --> 01:58.493
See ya.

02:00.000 --> 02:06.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:10.501 --> 02:12.469
Yeah, I can't wait to see.

02:16.905 --> 02:18.580
Hey, you okay?

02:20.341 --> 02:21.709
Yeah.

02:21.851 --> 02:25.383
That's a lie.
You have the same lie face.

02:26.055 --> 02:29.374
Uh, I'm visiting the widow
of one of my teammates today.

02:29.525 --> 02:32.155
Oh. That must be hard.

02:32.811 --> 02:34.462
That your, uh, morning look?

02:35.152 --> 02:38.166
Uh, I'm wearing nighttime clothes

02:38.201 --> 02:41.536
because I fell asleep
at a friend's place.

02:41.626 --> 02:42.726
No judgment.

02:43.183 --> 02:44.359
Nick.

02:44.444 --> 02:47.065
One of us is about to
pee on the floor, so...

02:47.643 --> 02:49.477
Come on, pal.

02:51.413 --> 02:54.180
Sarah, I'm moving my
things up from storage.

02:54.217 --> 02:55.283
Who knew there was room?

02:55.318 --> 02:56.451
There's not.

02:56.485 --> 02:58.249
Less talking and more lifting.

02:58.286 --> 03:00.079
Break's over.

03:06.949 --> 03:08.416
I didn't have sex.

03:08.608 --> 03:10.632
Are you bragging or apologizing?

03:12.335 --> 03:13.961
Hey, where are you going?

03:14.670 --> 03:16.003
Out.

03:17.039 --> 03:19.538
Lip gloss. Katie!

03:20.358 --> 03:21.443
Who's the boy?

03:21.477 --> 03:22.837
I don't know what you're talking about.

03:22.873 --> 03:24.663
It's 7:00 a.m.,
you're wearing lip gloss,

03:24.700 --> 03:26.243
and there's a boy on the stoop.
Is that him?

03:26.280 --> 03:28.416
- Jagger?
- I refuse to call him that.

03:28.451 --> 03:29.818
You don't have to call him anything.

03:29.852 --> 03:30.984
You're not meeting him.

03:31.021 --> 03:33.119
- Hold!
- Easy for you to say.

03:33.156 --> 03:36.391
- Are you going to tell him?
- Mom, there's people.

03:36.525 --> 03:38.750
- Why can't I meet him?
- Because you smell

03:38.787 --> 03:40.270
like a wino.

03:40.307 --> 03:41.774
Proceed.

03:42.326 --> 03:44.450
Put your back into it.

03:45.498 --> 03:47.302
Katie, we need to discuss this.

03:47.339 --> 03:48.873
Gonna find out eventually.

03:48.910 --> 03:50.594
Well, do you know what
you're going to say?

03:50.682 --> 03:52.316
Hey, Jagger, I'm pregnant.

03:52.375 --> 03:53.789
I mean, what you want from him.

03:53.826 --> 03:55.750
You have to understand you're
opening the situation up.

03:55.787 --> 03:58.079
And you have to understand
that I like him.

03:58.114 --> 03:59.309
Like, a lot.

03:59.346 --> 04:01.850
Like, almost as much as
you love being in control.

04:01.884 --> 04:03.466
What I love is you.

04:03.590 --> 04:04.959
I'm afraid he doesn't.

04:05.107 --> 04:07.545
Katie, I heard you say he
wanted to see other people.

04:07.646 --> 04:10.191
Yeah, to know if we're
really right for each other.

04:10.303 --> 04:12.262
Baby, kids say things like that.

04:12.299 --> 04:16.264
I'm not your baby. I'm having a baby.

04:16.369 --> 04:20.146
Okay, and he is not a kid.
He is the father of my baby.

04:24.344 --> 04:26.673
He texted me this morning.

04:27.576 --> 04:29.580
Said he missed me.

04:30.150 --> 04:31.880
You know, maybe, in my story

04:31.914 --> 04:33.777
the guy doesn't leave.

04:34.481 --> 04:36.748
Wouldn't you want that for me?

04:40.470 --> 04:42.624
Great. Thanks.

04:42.790 --> 04:44.424
I'll let you know how it goes.

04:47.191 --> 04:49.681
- Son.
- Son.

04:49.767 --> 04:51.232
Son.

04:51.267 --> 04:53.409
- Son.
- No, no.

04:53.900 --> 05:00.842
Both children. Children.
My son, your daughter,

05:00.876 --> 05:02.944
Daughter.

05:03.158 --> 05:05.800
- Good job.
- Ava Behzadi.

05:08.634 --> 05:09.868
Come with me.

05:24.567 --> 05:26.275
What's going on?

05:26.969 --> 05:28.655
You're coming home.

05:29.252 --> 05:30.619
Mamma!

05:41.254 --> 05:43.284
Given the size and
location of the tumor,

05:43.319 --> 05:46.021
it's best to take an
immediate course of action.

05:46.128 --> 05:47.956
You'll start with a few
rounds of chemotherapy

05:47.990 --> 05:49.557
in the hopes of shrinking the tumor.

05:49.758 --> 05:52.227
If that's successful,
we'll proceed with surgery,

05:52.261 --> 05:54.001
then radiation therapy.

05:54.163 --> 05:55.871
Does all of that makes sense?

05:55.942 --> 05:59.979
A few months of chemo,

06:00.016 --> 06:01.881
surgery,

06:02.342 --> 06:04.310
and radiation.

06:05.908 --> 06:08.176
We're familiar from the last time.

06:08.277 --> 06:09.744
Often the questions come later.

06:09.779 --> 06:11.146
You can call any time.

06:12.855 --> 06:13.970
Thank you, Doctor.

06:14.028 --> 06:16.096
Reception will schedule
your first treatment.

06:16.182 --> 06:18.872
- How soon?
- It's aggressive.

06:19.043 --> 06:20.844
We'll wanna get right on it.

06:22.363 --> 06:25.474
No, no, no,
that was this morning actually.

06:25.746 --> 06:27.941
Yeah, bye. You bet. Bye.

06:28.144 --> 06:29.629
What, are you telling people already?

06:29.754 --> 06:31.366
No, baby, that was my brother.

06:31.400 --> 06:33.043
Who will tell his wife,

06:33.100 --> 06:34.621
who will tell her prayer circle.

06:34.871 --> 06:36.404
People just want to help, Patricia.

06:36.439 --> 06:38.006
They can't. That's why they resort

06:38.040 --> 06:40.275
to sappy affirmations and prayer lists.

06:40.309 --> 06:42.490
Look, the power of prayer

06:42.527 --> 06:44.770
- has been scientifically proven to...
- Ron!

06:45.154 --> 06:48.920
I don't want people to
know until they must.

06:48.957 --> 06:50.992
I just want them to
go on with their lives

06:51.029 --> 06:53.597
and leave me alone to fight this.

06:55.812 --> 06:57.942
Does that include me, too?

06:58.081 --> 07:01.049
I'm gonna take the long way home.

07:17.244 --> 07:19.779
Something about a girl
with a sharp object.

07:19.915 --> 07:22.771
- How you doing, soldier?
- Mm-mm. Civilian.

07:23.283 --> 07:25.250
I'll believe it when I see it.

07:25.488 --> 07:28.256
Hop over here and give a girl a hug.

07:33.893 --> 07:35.193
How's that leg?

07:35.230 --> 07:36.797
I'll spare you the pants drop.

07:38.033 --> 07:39.720
- Does it hurt?
- No.

07:39.869 --> 07:41.102
Only when I overdo it.

07:41.285 --> 07:44.221
So it hurts.

07:44.440 --> 07:46.908
So, what exactly is this place?

07:47.010 --> 07:48.666
- Boxlates.
- Boxlates?

07:48.703 --> 07:49.959
- Boxlates.
- Wow.

07:50.091 --> 07:51.224
Pilates and boxing.

07:51.313 --> 07:52.593
Stretch you out and then kick your ass.

07:52.650 --> 07:55.393
- Wow, where do I sign up?
- I'll kick yours for free.

07:56.752 --> 07:58.657
It's gonna be a minute
until I'm up and running.

07:58.854 --> 08:00.414
You know they have people
that do this, right?

08:00.450 --> 08:01.939
It's too expensive.

08:02.080 --> 08:03.354
Life insurance bought the place,

08:03.399 --> 08:06.901
but sweat equity is gonna
have to renovate it.

08:07.108 --> 08:08.809
How you holding up?

08:09.031 --> 08:10.940
Missing him is nothing new.

08:11.300 --> 08:13.268
I did it half a year, every year.

08:15.923 --> 08:18.535
So I heard a rumor from the guys

08:18.572 --> 08:21.206
that you ran into an old
girlfriend at the VA?

08:21.644 --> 08:23.444
She told you you have a kid?

08:23.509 --> 08:25.596
A daughter. She's seventeen.

08:25.721 --> 08:27.215
Hell of a thing to get sprung on you.

08:29.051 --> 08:30.618
Or not?

08:30.783 --> 08:32.220
Nick.

08:32.346 --> 08:35.940
I've known for a while longer.

08:36.205 --> 08:37.496
Like, weeks?

08:37.533 --> 08:39.115
Seven years?

08:39.880 --> 08:42.148
And mom didn't know you knew.

08:42.331 --> 08:44.966
So she was like,
"Nick, you have a kid,"

08:45.000 --> 08:46.901
and you were like...

08:46.990 --> 08:48.257
"Wow."

08:50.627 --> 08:51.973
Because?

08:54.518 --> 08:56.311
I think I was just scared
she'd change her mind

08:56.392 --> 08:58.426
about telling her that I'm her dad.

08:58.533 --> 09:00.572
You know, I mean, we haven't yet.

09:00.635 --> 09:04.319
We haven't told her,
but, um, I met her.

09:07.018 --> 09:08.488
She's great.

09:09.471 --> 09:11.252
That'll be good for you.

09:12.003 --> 09:13.237
Family.

09:17.690 --> 09:19.330
Amy, um...

09:20.353 --> 09:22.060
there's something I have to tell you.

09:24.330 --> 09:25.861
About how Cooper died.

09:28.041 --> 09:29.444
Look at that. Break's over.

09:29.478 --> 09:31.279
Come on, I'm gonna put you to work.

09:36.367 --> 09:38.820
I mean, my dad's pressing me
to take the early acceptance

09:38.857 --> 09:40.729
to Hunter, but, I mean,

09:40.766 --> 09:42.166
I don't get why I
wouldn't just wait it out,

09:42.202 --> 09:44.259
see if NYU comes through, you know?

09:44.293 --> 09:45.573
I mean, it's more expensive, but...

09:45.610 --> 09:46.877
how cool would that be, right?

09:46.914 --> 09:49.805
Really cool. I was glad you texted.

09:49.844 --> 09:51.599
It's kinda been awhile, so...

09:51.899 --> 09:54.263
Yeah. Emma was totally jealous of you.

09:54.524 --> 09:56.195
- She was?
- Of course she was.

09:56.258 --> 09:57.582
Look at you.

09:58.586 --> 10:01.273
We broke up on Friday.
You knew that, right?

10:01.659 --> 10:03.111
I've been out on suspension.

10:03.231 --> 10:05.713
I... I heard. That's awesome.

10:05.935 --> 10:08.102
Not really.

10:09.585 --> 10:11.947
- Jagger?
- Yeah, hold on.

10:12.809 --> 10:15.535
- Jagger.
- One second, sorry.

10:33.551 --> 10:35.317
<i>Katie.</i>

10:35.555 --> 10:38.086
<i>Please tell me you
didn't track my phone.</i>

10:38.492 --> 10:40.556
That would be a lie.

10:44.147 --> 10:46.782
- Where's the kid?
- He's not a kid.

10:47.067 --> 10:49.444
And I don't want to talk about it.

10:54.090 --> 10:55.930
Good man's hard to find these days.

10:55.966 --> 10:57.178
- Seriously, mom?
- Seems as soon

10:57.215 --> 10:59.389
as you find one, some dame comes along,

10:59.423 --> 11:00.790
flashes her skirt, and poof.

11:00.887 --> 11:04.694
1930's movie heroine
voice is so inappropriate.

11:07.075 --> 11:10.177
Sometimes it makes you smile.

11:15.074 --> 11:17.121
To hell with men, that's what I say.

11:17.176 --> 11:18.613
We women have to stick together.

11:18.650 --> 11:21.089
Why sure, we do.
I'd take a friend like you

11:21.126 --> 11:22.579
over half a man like him any day.

11:23.712 --> 11:25.613
Take a friend like you, too.

11:38.418 --> 11:41.438
Almost like you never left. Oh!

11:42.173 --> 11:44.067
How am I out, Ben?

11:44.921 --> 11:46.789
People came together, you know?

11:47.565 --> 11:49.433
What people?

11:51.493 --> 11:53.329
Policeman's Union has a relief fund.

11:53.366 --> 11:55.333
It's... it's like a loan.

11:55.591 --> 11:58.400
You took out a $10,000
loan to pay my bond?

11:58.437 --> 12:00.016
It's not a big deal.

12:00.087 --> 12:01.327
I wasn't even going to mention it.

12:01.364 --> 12:03.727
Mom, this is for you!

12:04.013 --> 12:06.548
Wow, you made it?

12:08.611 --> 12:10.445
Mm-mm, Ava. Mm.

12:10.480 --> 12:12.189
- Mm.
- It's good, right?

12:12.275 --> 12:13.370
Mm.

12:13.407 --> 12:15.030
Funny thing about salt and sugar.

12:15.785 --> 12:17.519
- Easily confused.
- Mm.

12:17.795 --> 12:20.897
I'm... gonna let you two catch up.

12:22.399 --> 12:25.240
- Mmm.
- I missed you.

12:27.316 --> 12:30.045
Hey, I gotta cut out, boss.

12:30.363 --> 12:32.968
Having a party for
someone in my building,

12:33.071 --> 12:35.170
and I volunteered to help.

12:35.523 --> 12:37.806
Look at you, already making friends.

12:38.053 --> 12:39.374
You should come.

12:39.618 --> 12:41.308
Be nice to get out of the house.

12:41.443 --> 12:43.345
Dust-free environment.

12:43.694 --> 12:46.348
Mingling with strangers
is not really my bag.

12:46.658 --> 12:48.316
Cooper was the social one.

12:49.999 --> 12:52.153
- Amy, uh...
- I don't want to know, Nick.

12:53.924 --> 12:56.133
Unless it's a story that
ends with him alive,

12:56.170 --> 12:58.527
I don't... I don't want to know.

13:02.698 --> 13:04.566
Text me your address.

13:08.232 --> 13:09.701
Great.

13:25.779 --> 13:27.882
<i>I have been of service.</i>

13:29.732 --> 13:32.256
<i>I have tripled my case load.</i>

13:34.122 --> 13:39.401
I have sown love, checked my ego.

13:39.708 --> 13:43.911
I have been an agent for good,

13:44.044 --> 13:48.314
and you've put this
poison back in my body.

13:55.848 --> 13:58.984
This black rot,

13:59.088 --> 14:02.223
blooming in my core.

14:18.205 --> 14:20.241
This was not the deal.

14:22.604 --> 14:25.747
I have held up my end.

14:30.686 --> 14:33.488
How dare you?

14:50.164 --> 14:51.915
Well, why don't I show
them the Park Slope unit

14:51.952 --> 14:53.752
after we hit Dumbo?

14:53.837 --> 14:57.773
Great. Okay, thank you.

14:58.010 --> 14:59.377
Hi!

14:59.477 --> 15:01.594
Hi, I'm Sarah Campbell.

15:01.716 --> 15:03.682
I hope you don't mind.
I found you in the parent directory.

15:03.719 --> 15:05.787
Oh, do our kids go to school together?

15:06.387 --> 15:08.054
They're having a child together.

15:13.814 --> 15:16.839
<i>I'm sorry, my son talks to
me about who he's dating,</i>

15:16.876 --> 15:20.313
<i>and I have not heard that name.</i>

15:20.507 --> 15:23.097
I thought my kid told
me everything, too.

15:24.184 --> 15:26.452
This would have been
about 14 weeks ago.

15:27.854 --> 15:30.122
14 weeks?

15:30.923 --> 15:33.698
Well, he's been with
Emma that whole time,

15:33.735 --> 15:37.830
and before that there was,
a Chantel and a Megan.

15:37.883 --> 15:40.699
Well, in the middle
somewhere, there was a Katie.

15:40.796 --> 15:43.230
Well, I guess she worked fast.

15:44.237 --> 15:47.298
I'm sorry, did you just
list your son's conquests

15:47.335 --> 15:49.508
and then call my daughter a slut?

15:49.633 --> 15:52.111
I'm just saying, they all date around.

15:52.226 --> 15:54.416
- I trust Katie.
- Well, that explains

15:54.453 --> 15:56.954
why you didn't have
her on birth control.

15:57.183 --> 15:58.619
And this explains where your kid

15:58.656 --> 16:00.468
learned to shirk responsibility.

16:00.578 --> 16:02.734
- You listen to me...
- No, I will not.

16:02.922 --> 16:04.430
I will not listen.

16:04.609 --> 16:06.150
I will not be shut down by you

16:06.187 --> 16:08.160
like my daughter was by your son.

16:08.261 --> 16:10.462
My daughter is kind

16:10.601 --> 16:12.836
and she is funny and she is creative,

16:12.898 --> 16:14.914
and despite a world that
is shouting otherwise,

16:14.992 --> 16:17.758
she still believes that
people are fundamentally good.

16:17.874 --> 16:20.718
I will not let your
son take that from her.

16:20.882 --> 16:23.627
Her life is gonna be hard enough.

16:24.110 --> 16:25.677
What are you asking for?

16:27.648 --> 16:30.234
Just that he treat her kindly

16:31.251 --> 16:33.328
and that he own this.

16:36.856 --> 16:38.312
That's it.

16:46.933 --> 16:48.562
How did you get out?

16:48.641 --> 16:50.241
I made bond.

16:50.370 --> 16:52.578
There will be a hearing
to see if I'm deported.

16:52.726 --> 16:53.892
How can I help?

16:53.929 --> 16:55.633
Your help is why they picked me up

16:55.670 --> 16:56.742
in the first place.

16:56.797 --> 16:59.273
I did nothing you did not ask me to do.

16:59.320 --> 17:01.318
Forging documents?

17:02.168 --> 17:03.267
Is it true?

17:03.304 --> 17:05.416
You told me that you were protesting

17:05.451 --> 17:07.125
at the university in Tehran,

17:07.186 --> 17:08.954
that your life was in danger.

17:09.012 --> 17:10.564
You said you would get the evidence

17:10.601 --> 17:11.890
the government required.

17:11.926 --> 17:14.061
Evidence of anonymous
phone calls in the night?

17:14.260 --> 17:15.953
What did you think I would find?

17:16.031 --> 17:20.361
You can stand in court and
say, "I didn't know,"

17:20.397 --> 17:23.734
because I gave you
plausible deniability.

17:28.820 --> 17:32.277
Told you to text me so
I could help you carry.

17:34.393 --> 17:36.022
Dad.

17:36.648 --> 17:38.205
What are you doing here?

17:38.318 --> 17:40.252
Looking for your grandfather.

17:40.320 --> 17:42.406
Got a call from the nursing home.

17:42.689 --> 17:45.179
They told me he was removed
from their care by family,

17:45.250 --> 17:47.292
and I thought, "Well, I'm his family",

17:47.327 --> 17:49.252
- "but I didn't remove him."
- I was gonna tell you.

17:49.289 --> 17:50.796
They gave him this terrible roommate.

17:50.884 --> 17:53.299
- Broke his hip on those stairs.
- Yeah, but he's better now.

17:53.336 --> 17:54.734
Nothing gets better at 80, son.

17:54.797 --> 17:57.750
More things break.
That's why he's in a home.

17:57.875 --> 18:00.272
So they can take care of him
while he falls the hell apart.

18:00.469 --> 18:01.974
I'm gonna take care of him.

18:02.058 --> 18:03.675
You? Come on.

18:03.865 --> 18:05.477
You're two months from
finishing law school,

18:05.511 --> 18:07.646
you're studying for the bar,
and you have an internship

18:07.680 --> 18:09.000
- at my firm.
- Dad.

18:09.054 --> 18:11.783
You don't have the bandwidth.
Don't be stupid.

18:11.818 --> 18:13.818
Something's going to slip,
and if it's not your grandfather

18:13.854 --> 18:15.454
on those stairs,
it's gonna be your future.

18:15.488 --> 18:17.812
Don't you speak to him like that.

18:18.024 --> 18:19.929
- He's my son.
- And you're mine.

18:20.000 --> 18:22.416
I will not have you
disrespect him under my roof.

18:22.453 --> 18:24.218
It's not your roof anymore, Pop.

18:24.310 --> 18:26.085
He lived here 35 years.

18:26.164 --> 18:27.711
And Gabriel lived with me

18:27.748 --> 18:30.335
every time you disrespected your wife.

18:30.468 --> 18:32.351
Wow, what a hero.

18:32.739 --> 18:34.656
Except when it comes to
practical things like,

18:34.739 --> 18:36.840
I don't know, keeping a job?

18:36.976 --> 18:38.750
Food on the table?

18:38.915 --> 18:40.482
Look at this dump.

18:40.580 --> 18:42.648
You didn't even leave
him room to study.

18:43.049 --> 18:45.517
Get the hell out of my apartment.

18:48.500 --> 18:50.355
You wanna blow everything
up for an old man?

18:50.390 --> 18:51.690
Hm?

18:51.724 --> 18:52.958
It's your call.

18:52.992 --> 18:54.603
But your grandfather's a taker, son.

18:54.640 --> 18:58.263
My advice: Don't get took.

19:00.400 --> 19:02.601
Watch your step, huh?

19:13.546 --> 19:15.681
This is beautiful, isn't it?

19:15.715 --> 19:18.083
Sometimes I come up here

19:18.117 --> 19:20.028
and just breathe in the city.

19:20.353 --> 19:24.089
Couple of nights ago, I got an earful.

19:24.273 --> 19:25.991
You and Sarah.

19:27.500 --> 19:29.034
How full?

19:29.085 --> 19:31.212
Your drama is not my business,

19:31.249 --> 19:32.343
and as far as I'm concerned,

19:32.380 --> 19:33.471
it's nobody else's either.

19:33.702 --> 19:35.500
- Well, I appreciate that.
- But, Sarah now,

19:35.754 --> 19:39.100
she is my business, my girl,

19:39.194 --> 19:41.740
and her girl... that's my baby girl,

19:42.116 --> 19:45.421
and if you hurt them, I will fire you

19:46.000 --> 19:48.271
and do other bad stuff.

19:49.303 --> 19:51.950
- I still don't work for you.
- The hell you don't.

19:52.303 --> 19:56.046
First shift is tomorrow.
I got my eye on you, son.

19:56.147 --> 19:59.424
It's gonna be good.
We're gonna be tight.

20:15.351 --> 20:17.352
Any chance you're looking
up a Bungled Negroni?

20:18.014 --> 20:19.587
Enzo just ordered one.

20:20.061 --> 20:22.415
I am texting my daughter and obsessing

20:22.452 --> 20:24.192
over her lack of response.

20:24.272 --> 20:25.997
Huh. That's productive.

20:26.546 --> 20:29.697
Well, here's hoping it
tastes like a screwdriver.

20:32.053 --> 20:33.879
How's your friend's widow?

20:34.203 --> 20:36.511
Putting one foot in front of the other.

20:36.894 --> 20:38.606
And you?

20:39.421 --> 20:41.009
Only one foot.

20:43.835 --> 20:46.741
So, no booze, huh?
Not even your old standby,

20:46.842 --> 20:48.016
Crystal Light and vodka?

20:48.050 --> 20:49.784
No, I have graduated to Chardonnay.

20:49.872 --> 20:50.969
- Ooh.
- Yeah.

20:51.006 --> 20:52.520
Last night I earned a doctorate.

20:52.749 --> 20:54.484
We really don't know
each other anymore.

20:54.863 --> 20:57.025
Either of you know what
a Bungled Negroni is?

20:57.059 --> 20:58.134
You made it.

20:58.171 --> 21:00.575
Yeah, already taking orders apparently.

21:02.395 --> 21:03.998
Hey, pretty sure we
met the other night.

21:04.149 --> 21:05.849
Uh, John. You're the vet?

21:05.918 --> 21:07.402
- Nick.
- Right.

21:07.926 --> 21:09.537
- What's your drink?
- Water.

21:09.932 --> 21:11.873
I... I...
I overdid it a bit last night.

21:12.406 --> 21:13.931
Really?

21:14.743 --> 21:17.005
- Kidding. There you go.
- Thanks.

21:21.510 --> 21:23.217
Uh...

21:23.734 --> 21:26.825
I just spotted a friend,
so I'm gonna go ahead

21:26.862 --> 21:28.425
and leave you two without a chaperone.

21:30.878 --> 21:33.461
- Good to see you, John.
- Yeah, you too.

21:35.080 --> 21:37.317
That guy disappears whenever I show up.

21:37.456 --> 21:39.581
You have something against
being left alone with me?

21:39.684 --> 21:41.936
Only that it hasn't happened enough.

21:44.919 --> 21:45.986
Do I know you?

21:46.023 --> 21:47.885
Everything disappears at
the stroke of midnight.

21:47.986 --> 21:49.932
- Hope you brought a robe.
- Nice.

21:50.018 --> 21:51.779
I'm kidding. You look great.

21:51.953 --> 21:53.401
I'm glad you came.

21:53.510 --> 21:56.607
- So where's the kid?
- Dodging her mother.

21:57.245 --> 21:58.946
And which one's she?

21:59.121 --> 22:00.588
You serious?

22:00.851 --> 22:02.419
You think I came for the appetizers?

22:02.453 --> 22:04.014
Serve me up some drama, Porter.

22:04.104 --> 22:06.705
Um, by the drink table.

22:11.448 --> 22:12.696
Okay, too personal.

22:12.730 --> 22:15.165
Damn. Nice work, young Nick.

22:15.199 --> 22:16.466
Keep your voice down.

22:16.500 --> 22:18.615
- Wait until I get this drink in me.
- Yeah.

22:19.704 --> 22:22.893
Hey. How was your walk?

22:23.454 --> 22:26.055
I shouldn't have snapped
like that earlier today.

22:27.168 --> 22:30.237
I guess I just don't want
to be made the spectacle of.

22:30.354 --> 22:33.278
I should have asked you
before talking to my brother.

22:33.517 --> 22:34.818
I'm sorry.

22:34.852 --> 22:36.928
You're such a good man,

22:37.161 --> 22:38.661
and I am a lucky woman.

22:39.907 --> 22:41.658
I'm gonna mingle until Ava gets here,

22:41.692 --> 22:42.745
and then can we...

22:42.782 --> 22:44.294
can we call it an early night?

22:44.328 --> 22:46.008
Oh, yeah.

22:52.461 --> 22:55.415
Stare all you want,
she's a married woman.

22:55.463 --> 22:56.750
Husband's a monster.

22:56.787 --> 22:58.526
I just can't help myself.

22:58.591 --> 23:01.426
Can you, uh, spare five minutes?

23:01.579 --> 23:03.026
Yeah.

23:08.233 --> 23:10.313
- You told his mother?
- I've been texting you.

23:10.361 --> 23:13.430
Yeah, so has he.
Mostly exclamation points.

23:13.550 --> 23:15.438
How could you do this
without talking to me first?

23:15.475 --> 23:17.446
I couldn't let him
disrespect you like that.

23:17.516 --> 23:19.321
So you disrespect me yourself?

23:19.358 --> 23:20.730
I was standing up for you, Katie.

23:20.765 --> 23:21.860
That's what a mother does.

23:21.897 --> 23:23.313
Well, you know what a friend does?

23:23.350 --> 23:25.118
Gives you a heads-up.

23:27.598 --> 23:29.132
Go, go, go.

23:34.945 --> 23:37.159
Well, it looks like you
might get your drama.

23:37.424 --> 23:39.977
- Let me guess.
- That's the kid.

23:40.727 --> 23:44.641
- Katie, wait, please.
- Do not follow me.

23:46.959 --> 23:49.784
I'm turning location services off.

23:56.750 --> 23:58.399
Place has an echo.

24:01.045 --> 24:02.779
This seat taken?

24:02.899 --> 24:04.213
You'll regret it.

24:04.250 --> 24:06.868
Only when I try to get back up.

24:08.288 --> 24:10.923
Ah. This better be good.

24:12.384 --> 24:15.052
Katie talked to the dad today,

24:15.219 --> 24:18.020
and it went like I assumed it would.

24:18.189 --> 24:20.922
Now I'm bracing for an "I told you so."

24:21.792 --> 24:23.208
From what little I know,

24:23.245 --> 24:26.448
you and he are very different people.

24:27.589 --> 24:30.588
So she's mad at you because...?

24:31.574 --> 24:35.235
I told his mother he's
a terrible human being.

24:36.238 --> 24:37.954
Interesting tactic.

24:38.469 --> 24:40.954
Napalm first, ask questions later.

24:43.561 --> 24:45.362
Well, it could have been a lot worse.

24:47.318 --> 24:50.040
You've been mad at
this kid for 17 years.

24:51.718 --> 24:53.552
At least I know he grows up okay.

24:55.283 --> 24:56.817
Hm.

24:59.897 --> 25:02.907
- I'm glad you sat down.
- Yeah.

25:06.214 --> 25:09.382
- Sorry.
- No, actually, uh, I'm...

25:09.707 --> 25:11.000
- I'm in your sp...
- No, please.

25:11.037 --> 25:13.162
No, really. I was just, um,

25:14.052 --> 25:15.919
grabbing something from downstairs.

25:20.151 --> 25:22.103
- You should, uh...
- Yeah.

25:22.660 --> 25:23.860
Bye.

25:34.126 --> 25:36.260
<i>I wasn't actually grabbing anything,</i>

25:36.294 --> 25:38.428
<i>and, uh, now this is awkward.</i>

25:38.861 --> 25:40.228
- John.
- You don't owe me

25:40.265 --> 25:41.899
an explanation. We've been out twice.

25:41.982 --> 25:45.951
Nick's not here for me.
He's here for Katie.

25:46.102 --> 25:49.622
She thinks her father was
a mistake and he wasn't.

25:51.859 --> 25:53.946
She doesn't know it's him?

25:54.484 --> 25:58.162
I was hurt at first.

25:59.065 --> 26:02.391
Then I found out he was
in Ranger School and...

26:03.635 --> 26:05.602
I didn't want her finding a father

26:05.639 --> 26:07.840
who was just gonna get killed.

26:12.345 --> 26:13.979
Look, Sarah, a couple years ago,

26:14.378 --> 26:16.800
I would have risen to
the challenge here,

26:16.837 --> 26:20.136
because you're awesome and stunning...

26:20.226 --> 26:22.561
He's just my daughter's father now.

26:22.689 --> 26:24.156
Yeah.

26:24.293 --> 26:25.958
When you asked me out the other day,

26:25.992 --> 26:28.160
you said you didn't want to look

26:28.370 --> 26:31.041
catastrophically single.

26:31.598 --> 26:33.175
In front of who?

26:38.598 --> 26:40.265
I think I know where this is headed.

26:40.331 --> 26:42.174
Just trying to learn from my mistakes,

26:42.347 --> 26:44.066
of which there have been plenty.

26:45.712 --> 26:48.651
But thank you. This was fun.

26:49.455 --> 26:50.892
It was.

26:52.719 --> 26:54.152
I'll see you.

27:00.370 --> 27:03.060
We have a strong relationship
with our family priest,

27:03.097 --> 27:06.198
who does a lot of counseling,
and I think it would be helpful

27:06.277 --> 27:08.600
for both of you to sit down with him.

27:08.831 --> 27:12.338
- Mom, she's not Catholic.
- Clearly.

27:12.585 --> 27:15.263
You don't have to be Catholic
to take some good advice.

27:15.300 --> 27:18.544
My sister has two extra
rooms in Staten Island,

27:18.578 --> 27:20.576
and of course,
this would have to be worked out,

27:20.613 --> 27:22.948
but there is a childcare center nearby,

27:22.982 --> 27:25.184
which would allow you to work.

27:25.218 --> 27:27.261
I was planning to live with my mom.

27:27.298 --> 27:29.839
Well, I heard it was a one-bedroom.

27:29.902 --> 27:32.696
Two. We converted the dining room.

27:33.026 --> 27:35.894
- Is there a door?
- French?

27:35.980 --> 27:39.474
Honey, I think that this plan

27:39.511 --> 27:41.152
makes a little bit more sense.

27:41.189 --> 27:44.324
This is all obviously
pending a paternity test.

27:44.493 --> 27:45.737
Justin.

27:45.925 --> 27:48.540
And we will discuss with
Paul about deferring college

27:48.575 --> 27:50.576
for a year so that he can contribute.

27:50.680 --> 27:52.915
Who's Paul?

27:55.712 --> 27:57.651
Your name is Paul?

27:58.519 --> 28:00.687
This isn't happening.

28:00.792 --> 28:03.088
Did you have college plans, sweetheart?

28:03.245 --> 28:05.714
Um, I'm into art.

28:05.792 --> 28:08.668
She does these, uh, yarn

28:08.705 --> 28:10.435
- things.
- Bombs.

28:10.472 --> 28:12.113
No idea what we're talking about.

28:12.150 --> 28:13.310
Justin, dammit, could you just...

28:13.346 --> 28:15.959
I was thinking school of visual arts.

28:16.831 --> 28:19.271
Well, there is plenty of opportunities

28:19.305 --> 28:21.178
to knit with a baby.

28:23.394 --> 28:26.078
I don't mean to be
rude, but my mom and I

28:26.112 --> 28:27.446
are already discussing this.

28:27.480 --> 28:29.748
No offense,
but barking at me about your honor

28:29.783 --> 28:31.216
is a lot easier

28:31.251 --> 28:32.941
than actually handling this mess.

28:32.996 --> 28:36.678
This isn't a mess, okay?
This is a baby.

28:40.519 --> 28:43.214
Katie. Katie, wait.
I have money for a cab.

28:43.316 --> 28:45.785
- Without a paternity test?
- What's that supposed to mean?

28:45.863 --> 28:48.066
You're the only person I've been with.

28:48.101 --> 28:50.269
Okay, well, they don't know that.

28:50.456 --> 28:52.386
- But you do.
- Do I?

28:52.449 --> 28:56.097
Yeah, you do, because I told you so.

28:56.233 --> 28:58.034
Look, they're just trying to
help, okay?

28:58.071 --> 29:00.505
- Well, I don't need it.
- Oh, really?

29:00.647 --> 29:02.972
You have a single mom who
works at a nursing home.

29:03.009 --> 29:05.577
Who isn't trying to dictate
how you live your life.

29:05.614 --> 29:08.850
No, she's just narcing me out
to my parents so they can!

29:08.955 --> 29:10.511
You know what I heard back there?

29:10.623 --> 29:12.777
I heard I could have the family priest

29:12.814 --> 29:14.864
and a room at your aunt's house.

29:15.261 --> 29:18.011
What nobody mentioned
is whether I get you.

29:20.033 --> 29:22.090
You said that you missed me.

29:23.933 --> 29:25.408
But do you want me?

29:26.206 --> 29:28.173
Because I still want you.

29:29.794 --> 29:31.995
I think we should just
do what my mom says.

29:34.637 --> 29:38.173
- You're a kid.
- So are you.

29:50.051 --> 29:51.861
I'm glad I got to see
you taking a break.

29:51.898 --> 29:53.494
Liquid courage.

29:53.666 --> 29:55.973
I told Ava I'd keep
helping her with her case.

29:56.043 --> 29:57.369
You're a good boy.

29:57.403 --> 29:59.465
- We were immigrants too, you know.
- Yeah.

29:59.502 --> 30:01.302
What I don't know how
to do is keep her here.

30:01.339 --> 30:02.640
You'll figure it out.

30:02.777 --> 30:04.832
Come on. I got something to show you.

30:09.660 --> 30:11.066
Look, Gabe-y.

30:11.184 --> 30:13.952
A place to work when
my opera gets too loud.

30:16.113 --> 30:17.523
You did this for me?

30:17.557 --> 30:20.125
Ron moved the desk. I dragged the lamp.

30:22.228 --> 30:23.407
What do you think?

30:23.444 --> 30:25.364
Where do I hang my shingle?

30:32.816 --> 30:37.012
Ah, there she is.

30:37.371 --> 30:39.808
Okay, everybody. Eyes up here.

30:41.879 --> 30:44.675
One of our own has returned home.

30:45.129 --> 30:48.927
Whoo!

30:49.321 --> 30:52.323
Ava, I offer you this.

30:54.684 --> 30:58.191
"What I have shaped
into a kind of life."

30:58.636 --> 31:00.652
"I had no model."

31:01.439 --> 31:03.116
Psst.

31:03.803 --> 31:05.776
"Born in Babylon,"

31:06.582 --> 31:09.574
"both non-white and woman,"

31:09.736 --> 31:13.245
"what did I see to be except myself?"

31:13.395 --> 31:15.465
"I made it up here on the bridge"

31:15.504 --> 31:18.356
"between starshine and clay,"

31:18.738 --> 31:23.789
"my one hand holding
tight my other hand."

31:24.105 --> 31:26.391
"Come celebrate with me"

31:26.879 --> 31:30.738
"that every day something
tries to kill me"

31:30.878 --> 31:32.945
"and has failed."

31:38.184 --> 31:40.036
Go get your mamma back.

31:43.242 --> 31:44.977
Thank you for that. Aww.

31:51.027 --> 31:52.949
What the hell is wrong with you?

32:02.306 --> 32:04.307
You wanna tell me what I did?

32:05.496 --> 32:07.639
Why would you read that poem
to me in front of people

32:07.676 --> 32:10.936
when I told you that I did not
want to be made a spectacle of?

32:11.043 --> 32:12.332
It was for Ava.

32:12.379 --> 32:14.772
"Come celebrate with me that every day"

32:14.809 --> 32:18.180
"something has tried to
kill me and has failed."

32:19.194 --> 32:20.621
Okay.

32:21.600 --> 32:24.102
Maybe a little bit for you.

32:24.418 --> 32:27.753
You know the poet,
Lucille Clifton, had cancer?

32:27.787 --> 32:28.941
Yes, I know.

32:28.978 --> 32:30.365
I also know that she died of it.

32:30.402 --> 32:32.124
The celebration ended.

32:34.627 --> 32:36.728
Of all the poems...

32:38.145 --> 32:40.527
- I'm not gonna let you keep running.
- Get out of my way.

32:40.809 --> 32:44.139
- I said get out of my way!
- Why? Hmm?

32:44.176 --> 32:46.538
So you can leave me again
like you did last time?

32:46.637 --> 32:50.027
I didn't leave you.
I spared you me in the depths

32:50.074 --> 32:52.600
because you couldn't handle my pain,

32:52.637 --> 32:55.082
the puking, the grief, the fear.

32:55.136 --> 32:57.504
- I never asked to be spared.
- Oh, please,

32:57.566 --> 33:00.199
and I didn't ask for
Lucille-damn-Clifton,

33:00.262 --> 33:03.021
the bleach everywhere. The platitudes.

33:03.056 --> 33:04.863
The way you cope, it's...

33:05.934 --> 33:07.592
it's more work for me, Ron,

33:07.629 --> 33:09.965
being in charge of your pain and mine.

33:10.002 --> 33:11.498
I don't have it in me.

33:11.535 --> 33:13.652
But you are stronger than you know.

33:13.730 --> 33:15.197
Stop it.

33:15.501 --> 33:21.373
I feel broken and betrayed and scared.

33:21.407 --> 33:23.675
Well then tell me what
I can do different.

33:23.895 --> 33:27.879
You tell me to just shut
up or fend for my damn self

33:27.965 --> 33:30.182
or just leave you the hell alone,

33:30.254 --> 33:33.855
but I will not abandon ship.

33:34.187 --> 33:35.533
Do you hear me?

33:35.668 --> 33:36.955
You're gonna just have to

33:36.989 --> 33:39.825
suck it up and let me
love you the best I can,

33:39.859 --> 33:42.926
because this is my life at stake, too.

33:45.079 --> 33:47.165
You're an organ in my body, woman.

33:47.430 --> 33:50.016
If you fail, I fail.

33:52.477 --> 33:55.657
Then you better get yourself
right, my love,

33:56.724 --> 33:58.327
because...

33:58.945 --> 34:01.346
I have a bad feeling about this.

34:05.952 --> 34:07.825
Okay...

34:14.570 --> 34:16.071
<i>That party didn't seem appropriate,</i>

34:16.108 --> 34:17.670
<i>given it's a long road,</i>.

34:17.775 --> 34:19.882
but people wanted to
show their support.

34:20.420 --> 34:22.342
I'm touched by it.

34:23.429 --> 34:26.379
- Ben, I need you to take this.
- Okay, what is it?

34:26.647 --> 34:28.940
$3,700.

34:29.476 --> 34:31.851
I'll pay the rest in installments.

34:32.197 --> 34:34.069
I don't understand.
Where'd it come from?

34:35.726 --> 34:37.929
I sold a few things. I sold jewelry.

34:37.991 --> 34:39.525
- It doesn't matter.
- Ava, it's a bond.

34:39.560 --> 34:41.172
I get my money back
after your court date,

34:41.210 --> 34:42.570
but you can't get back
whatever you sold.

34:42.606 --> 34:44.155
You have to take it.

34:46.163 --> 34:50.036
Your generosity is overwhelming, Ben,

34:50.071 --> 34:51.705
but I can't accept it.

34:52.024 --> 34:53.591
That dependent person I've been

34:53.628 --> 34:55.222
is not how I want my son to see me.

34:55.337 --> 34:57.506
Lord knows I want the
best for that boy.

34:57.912 --> 34:59.312
I know.

34:59.671 --> 35:01.047
It means the world to me.

35:02.585 --> 35:05.827
I'm also fond of his
Farsi-singing mamma.

35:05.916 --> 35:08.289
Oh, you like that, huh?

35:09.123 --> 35:11.054
I may have watched a few times.

35:11.163 --> 35:13.406
Just a few?

35:18.015 --> 35:20.066
Your Nonna's mostaccioli.

35:20.101 --> 35:22.235
It's, like, 11:00 at night.

35:22.456 --> 35:24.324
You've gotta keep your strength up.

35:32.980 --> 35:34.414
Pretend I'm not here.

35:40.388 --> 35:42.760
It's good, right?

35:46.400 --> 35:48.507
He's not wrong, your father.

35:49.272 --> 35:51.665
I wasn't always there for
him when he was growing up.

35:53.749 --> 35:55.502
You've always been there for me.

35:55.827 --> 35:57.608
I'm gonna take care of you, Gabe-y.

35:59.640 --> 36:01.508
How about we take care of each other?

36:01.780 --> 36:04.377
Hm? I think Nonna
would have liked that.

36:14.679 --> 36:16.585
There's lots of leftover food.

36:16.741 --> 36:18.413
I'm good.

36:18.893 --> 36:20.319
Are you?

36:23.800 --> 36:25.501
I shouldn't have talked
to Jagger's mother

36:25.538 --> 36:27.210
without telling you.

36:27.499 --> 36:29.163
His real name is Paul.

36:29.343 --> 36:32.358
Secretly a Beatle.
Who would have thunk?

36:33.034 --> 36:34.301
You spoke?

36:34.733 --> 36:36.413
I was spoken to.

36:36.835 --> 36:38.548
His mother said that you

36:38.585 --> 36:41.030
barked at her defending my honor?

36:41.135 --> 36:42.702
She's lucky I had the leash on.

36:47.499 --> 36:49.589
Where do you think I'd be

36:49.623 --> 36:51.324
if you'd given me up for adoption?

36:54.593 --> 36:56.396
I think you'd be loved somewhere.

36:58.452 --> 36:59.866
Where do you think you'd be?

37:04.038 --> 37:06.647
There was this study a few years ago.

37:07.015 --> 37:09.366
They tested all of these old women

37:09.403 --> 37:13.514
and found male cell
tissue in their hearts.

37:14.436 --> 37:15.689
You know why?

37:17.265 --> 37:19.757
They were all mothers of sons.

37:20.686 --> 37:23.022
Turns out we trade cells before birth.

37:25.507 --> 37:27.374
I'm in your bones, girl.

37:29.710 --> 37:32.647
And you are everywhere in me.

37:33.890 --> 37:39.239
So wherever I ended up,
I would still be with you.

37:51.179 --> 37:53.920
Something about a man
who knows his macramé.

37:54.507 --> 37:57.354
Well, I'd say something funny
if I knew what that word meant.

37:57.827 --> 37:59.893
Thank you.

38:00.535 --> 38:01.647
You okay?

38:01.780 --> 38:02.954
Yeah, it just gets a little sore

38:02.991 --> 38:04.564
at the end of the day.

38:04.976 --> 38:06.405
Painkiller?

38:06.538 --> 38:07.967
No.

38:08.265 --> 38:09.636
How's it been?

38:10.155 --> 38:11.696
Well, I'm getting a prosthetic

38:11.733 --> 38:13.312
that I can play basketball on soon,

38:13.349 --> 38:15.917
so I guess that's cool.

38:22.735 --> 38:24.236
Can I touch it?

38:36.004 --> 38:37.638
I'm glad you're safe now.

38:40.226 --> 38:41.527
Home.

38:51.481 --> 38:53.513
- No, we can't do that.
- We're both alone.

38:53.731 --> 38:55.148
You're Cooper's wife.

38:55.973 --> 38:58.618
- Yeah, he's dead.
- Yeah, because of me.

39:00.567 --> 39:02.288
What are you talking about?

39:06.879 --> 39:10.763
We rolled into Helmand on
intel from an interpreter.

39:11.208 --> 39:13.967
Cooper didn't trust him, but...

39:14.379 --> 39:16.436
I pulled rank and I put
him in the same Humvee.

39:19.231 --> 39:20.921
We got hammered from
every direction, Ame.

39:20.958 --> 39:22.542
It was a mess.

39:24.379 --> 39:27.616
It was a mess that the interpreter

39:27.653 --> 39:29.449
that I trusted walked us right into.

39:31.705 --> 39:33.069
How do you know that?

39:34.754 --> 39:37.700
Because as soon as we were hit,
he shot Cooper in the head.

39:38.661 --> 39:40.268
Deacon took him out,
but it was too late.

39:42.692 --> 39:45.131
It was my fault, Ame.

39:45.708 --> 39:48.411
I didn't listen to
him, and now he's dead.
