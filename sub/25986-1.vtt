Subtitles by explosiveskull

01:05.631 --> 01:06.433
Shit.

01:33.358 --> 01:34.457
This way.

01:34.459 --> 01:36.695
Look, he came through here.

01:41.634 --> 01:42.865
- Well?
- Shh.

01:55.180 --> 01:56.445
Come on.

01:56.447 --> 01:57.781
Shit.

02:06.391 --> 02:07.192
Shit.

02:23.709 --> 02:24.740
Well?

02:24.742 --> 02:25.544
Come on.

02:35.987 --> 02:37.554
You then.

02:37.556 --> 02:39.489
Why don't you come
back quietly, Dan.

02:39.491 --> 02:41.427
Save yourself some pain.

02:43.861 --> 02:44.796
Fair enough.

03:06.951 --> 03:08.584
Who else knows?

03:08.586 --> 03:09.923
Who have you told?

03:19.865 --> 03:21.498
Nice of you boys
to finally join us.

03:21.500 --> 03:22.598
Yeah.

03:24.502 --> 03:25.404
Eh?

03:26.572 --> 03:28.371
You...

03:28.373 --> 03:30.374
Hello Danny, you miss me?

03:30.376 --> 03:32.743
Looks like you lost
a tooth there, Danny.

03:36.814 --> 03:37.616
Enough.

03:38.883 --> 03:40.684
Take him back with us.

03:40.686 --> 03:41.486
Fine.

03:58.836 --> 04:00.639
Get him out of here.

04:03.408 --> 04:06.076
How much do you
think he knows?

04:06.078 --> 04:08.377
We'll find out soon enough.

04:51.990 --> 04:53.123
Whoa whoa whoa.

05:12.110 --> 05:13.378
Who are you?

05:16.482 --> 05:18.748
I'm here to take you home.

05:37.769 --> 05:40.103
Yes, Danny-Boy.

05:40.105 --> 05:41.474
Yes.

05:43.875 --> 05:48.480
You know, right now you
look a lot like your Dad.

05:50.048 --> 05:51.617
Or is it maybe it
was your mother?

06:06.432 --> 06:07.764
As you were, Stockwell.

06:07.766 --> 06:09.402
Boss.

06:24.182 --> 06:26.048
Hello Daniel.

06:26.050 --> 06:28.120
You gave my boys quite
a runaround this afternoon.

06:30.189 --> 06:31.788
And I hear you
haven't said a word,

06:31.790 --> 06:33.789
despite all this unpleasantness.

06:33.791 --> 06:37.760
Oh I get it, you're a hard man.

06:37.762 --> 06:40.563
Well you've made your point,
but enough is enough,

06:40.565 --> 06:41.798
so why don't you
just tell me what...

06:41.800 --> 06:45.235
Daniel, Mason, Sergeant.

06:45.237 --> 06:47.637
Two, five, one.

06:47.639 --> 06:49.805
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
I know the routine.

06:49.807 --> 06:53.810
I've been where you are now,
Fallujah, four years ago.

06:53.812 --> 06:55.812
Those rag-heads
introduced me to concepts

06:55.814 --> 06:58.885
of pain I could
never have imagined.

07:00.218 --> 07:02.051
Would've killed me too.

07:02.053 --> 07:04.086
Except these boys
swung in against orders

07:04.088 --> 07:05.625
and got me the
fuck out of there.

07:17.235 --> 07:19.969
You know I served in
the gulf with your old man.

07:19.971 --> 07:21.139
He was a tough old bastard.

07:22.708 --> 07:24.841
You're not fit
to say his name.

07:24.843 --> 07:27.577
You're a disgrace.
All of you.

07:27.579 --> 07:30.049
What happened to
your dad today...

07:32.951 --> 07:34.117
Was regrettable.

07:41.860 --> 07:42.795
Good effort, old man.

07:44.129 --> 07:45.631
And your Mum.

07:47.798 --> 07:48.600
Shh.

07:50.601 --> 07:51.536
Wrong place.

07:55.574 --> 07:56.709
Wrong time.

08:10.988 --> 08:13.188
Dan, for whatever
you believe in,

08:13.190 --> 08:15.892
or just for the sake
of an easy death,

08:15.894 --> 08:17.530
tell me who you're working with.

08:29.107 --> 08:30.639
So are you prepared to die

08:30.641 --> 08:32.775
for your sense of
honor, Sergeant Mason?

08:32.778 --> 08:34.777
Since the day I joined.

08:34.779 --> 08:37.149
So why don't you get on
with it, you piece of shit.

09:14.952 --> 09:17.222
You
have one new message.

09:19.825 --> 09:21.925
Darling,
where's the Cardamon?

09:21.927 --> 09:24.297
I'm on the phone, Ettie my love.
It's in there somewhere.

09:25.364 --> 09:28.931
Hi, John, Dougie here.

09:28.933 --> 09:32.134
Been a while, so I hope to God you
still get your messages, mate.

09:32.136 --> 09:34.170
Douglas, the Cardamon.

09:34.172 --> 09:38.644
Oh do shush Ettie
please, I am on the phone.

09:40.211 --> 09:41.710
Listen, John,
I know it's been a while,

09:41.712 --> 09:44.113
and look,
regardless of how it was

09:44.115 --> 09:47.050
between us last time
you were here,

09:47.052 --> 09:48.384
Dan and I have been
working on something,

09:48.386 --> 09:50.853
and it's all gone very deep end.

09:50.855 --> 09:53.223
I hoped you might come back and
give us a hand for old time's sake.

09:54.759 --> 09:56.825
Oh,
maybe that's Daniel now.

09:58.397 --> 10:00.997
John, we
need your help here now.

10:00.999 --> 10:04.269
Call me...

11:57.249 --> 11:58.915
Ah yes, hello.

11:58.917 --> 12:01.483
I used to serve alongside
Sergeant Daniel Mason.

12:01.485 --> 12:04.320
I believe he is stationed
at your barracks.

12:04.322 --> 12:05.789
I'm actually in
town for a few days,

12:05.791 --> 12:07.293
and I was hoping
to catch up with...

12:14.231 --> 12:17.132
I'm sorry to have to tell
you that Sergeant Mason

12:17.134 --> 12:21.137
was the victim of
a terrible beating

12:21.139 --> 12:24.476
and subsequently he was stabbed
in the back of the neck.

12:31.149 --> 12:32.581
Any leads on who did this?

12:32.583 --> 12:34.819
Nothing that I can confirm.

12:36.020 --> 12:38.320
You local, sir?

12:38.322 --> 12:39.955
Used to be.

12:39.957 --> 12:42.559
The report says his
commanding officers

12:42.561 --> 12:44.426
assumed he'd gone AWOL,

12:44.428 --> 12:46.863
but then the body was found
on the outskirts of town

12:46.865 --> 12:50.400
by a section returning
to the barracks.

12:50.402 --> 12:51.968
Who filed the report?

12:51.970 --> 12:55.271
A Sergeant Hatcher.

12:55.273 --> 12:58.373
One of his men contacted the
emergency services immediately,

12:58.375 --> 13:00.443
but unfortunately Sergeant Mason

13:00.445 --> 13:02.311
was pronounced
dead at the scene.

13:02.313 --> 13:03.912
What about his parents?

13:03.914 --> 13:05.047
What are the police
doing about this?

13:05.049 --> 13:09.118
I believe our local constable

13:09.120 --> 13:10.855
is investigating both incidents.

13:13.625 --> 13:18.493
I'm not sure how
much he's found out

13:18.495 --> 13:21.933
and if I'm honest he's not
exactly the brightest spark,

13:23.268 --> 13:24.870
but here are his details.

13:27.438 --> 13:30.543
Again, my condolences
on your loss.

13:32.009 --> 13:35.277
As I understand
it, Sergeant Mason

13:35.279 --> 13:37.015
and his family were well liked.

13:39.149 --> 13:40.519
Is there anything else I can...

13:43.120 --> 13:44.653
Sir?

13:52.563 --> 13:53.498
Thank you.

14:02.374 --> 14:03.209
Dougie.

14:04.509 --> 14:05.311
Ettie.

14:11.081 --> 14:13.081
I'll take down the
bastards that did this.

14:13.083 --> 14:14.319
Every one of them.

14:16.553 --> 14:17.923
But you knew that already.

14:37.142 --> 14:40.443
Well would you look
at that, a real live ghost.

14:40.445 --> 14:43.015
It's not really him, can't be.

14:45.149 --> 14:46.150
Permission to move in?

14:49.553 --> 14:52.287
He's listed as a priority
target, should we...

14:52.289 --> 14:54.325
Negative, hold positions.

14:57.062 --> 14:58.364
Your orders sir?

15:00.465 --> 15:02.297
What are you even doing here?

15:02.299 --> 15:04.166
Sir, your orders.

15:04.168 --> 15:08.340
Well if I were you, I'd order
in body bags, lots of them.

15:44.442 --> 15:46.608
June the 30th.

15:46.610 --> 15:49.512
Hatcher has more than
20 years' experience.

15:49.514 --> 15:51.314
All the usual theatres.

15:51.316 --> 15:52.250
Highly decorated.

15:53.751 --> 15:56.419
But it is my belief that his men

15:56.421 --> 15:58.554
went rogue on
a job in Afghanistan,

15:58.556 --> 16:01.192
so me and Dan are going
to start digging around.

16:04.062 --> 16:04.730
July the second.

16:06.063 --> 16:07.530
According to Dan, Hatcher and

16:07.532 --> 16:09.699
his men are in a spot of bother.

16:09.701 --> 16:12.200
The RMPs are still
trying to find out

16:12.202 --> 16:14.503
exactly what they were up
to on their last mission,

16:14.505 --> 16:17.373
specifically the two days
that they spent deep inside

16:17.375 --> 16:22.478
Taliban country that Hatcher
still can't account for.

16:22.480 --> 16:24.113
Dan at the moment
is trying to get

16:24.115 --> 16:26.018
something concrete on
what they were up to.

16:30.488 --> 16:33.055
I've told him to
be very careful.

16:33.057 --> 16:35.593
Hatcher is one ruthless bastard.

16:44.168 --> 16:45.437
Alright, thank you, thanks.

16:51.743 --> 16:53.709
Well you haven't
been around lately.

16:53.711 --> 16:56.447
Yeah, sorry. It's just been
really manic round here.

16:59.283 --> 17:01.150
Well you know where we are.

17:01.152 --> 17:04.088
Yeah, sure, better
get back to work.

17:05.490 --> 17:06.290
Bruce.

17:08.291 --> 17:09.193
Round of the usual.

17:21.271 --> 17:22.240
Right then.

17:29.180 --> 17:30.446
I want a Vodka.

17:30.448 --> 17:31.847
I don't think so.

17:31.849 --> 17:34.283
I'm 18 in four months.

17:34.285 --> 17:36.388
Yeah and in four months I'll
buy you a drink to celebrate.

17:38.423 --> 17:39.855
There you go, on
the house of course.

17:39.857 --> 17:41.460
See me reaching for my wallet?

17:45.195 --> 17:46.828
What're you after, pal?

17:46.830 --> 17:49.632
I'm here to find whoever
murdered Sergeant Daniel Mason.

17:49.634 --> 17:51.133
Sorry, come again?

17:51.135 --> 17:53.201
I said, I'm here
to find whoever

17:53.203 --> 17:55.638
murdered Sergeant Daniel Mason.

17:55.640 --> 17:57.606
Well Dan was well
liked around these parts.

17:57.608 --> 17:58.807
Whatever happened to
him was a tragic loss.

17:58.809 --> 18:00.111
You taking the
piss or something?

18:01.346 --> 18:03.613
Something.

18:03.615 --> 18:06.481
If all things work out,
you won't have to work again.

18:06.483 --> 18:08.718
I like
the sound of that.

18:08.720 --> 18:10.786
Looking a bit
harassed there, Lambert.

18:10.788 --> 18:11.855
They run out of nuts again?

18:13.892 --> 18:15.892
Sandra, she's finally told
him about the Chlamydia.

18:15.894 --> 18:17.160
He's been scratching all night.

18:17.162 --> 18:19.394
New face.

18:19.396 --> 18:22.201
Just walked in and announced he's
here to find Dan Mason's killer.

18:24.635 --> 18:26.201
I'll take care of it.

18:26.203 --> 18:29.273
Easy, just point him
out to us, Lambert.

18:31.241 --> 18:32.842
Nothing?

18:32.844 --> 18:35.847
None of you've got anything
to say about Dan Mason?

18:37.248 --> 18:39.649
His parents, Dougie and Ettie?

18:39.651 --> 18:43.553
Lived around here for 30 years,
pillars of your community.

18:43.555 --> 18:45.755
Yet not one of you
has a single thing

18:45.757 --> 18:48.126
to say about their
brutal murders.

18:52.963 --> 18:54.729
You got something
you want to tell me?

18:54.731 --> 18:56.298
Mister, I'd watch who you mess

18:56.300 --> 18:57.735
with around here, if I were you.

18:58.936 --> 19:00.603
Would you now?

19:00.605 --> 19:02.837
Listen, it doesn't
look like anyone here

19:02.839 --> 19:05.474
can help you, so why
don't you just go?

19:05.476 --> 19:06.345
Excuse me.

19:11.548 --> 19:14.552
I knew the Masons, a little bit.

19:15.752 --> 19:16.619
Sis.

19:16.621 --> 19:17.987
Yes?

19:17.989 --> 19:21.390
They came into my
cafe from time to time.

19:21.392 --> 19:22.494
They were nice people.

19:23.861 --> 19:25.760
It was very sad what
happened to them.

19:25.762 --> 19:27.630
I don't know if
it'll help you much,

19:27.632 --> 19:31.801
but if you want to come in
and talk, we're there every day.

19:31.803 --> 19:34.569
Look, come on, we don't
want any trouble here.

19:34.571 --> 19:35.740
Best you just move on, eh?

19:36.907 --> 19:38.209
Thanks for the advice.

19:39.711 --> 19:41.710
But I'm not leaving
town until I find out

19:41.712 --> 19:43.414
what happened to
the Mason family.

19:44.982 --> 19:47.251
And if anybody has
a problem with that...

19:49.253 --> 19:50.421
I'll be outside.

20:01.365 --> 20:02.597
That was fast.

20:02.599 --> 20:04.235
We think you
might be a bit lost.

20:07.471 --> 20:08.837
Nope.

20:08.839 --> 20:10.472
You best stop shooting
your mouth off, pal.

20:10.474 --> 20:12.243
And leave town
for your own good.

20:15.480 --> 20:16.914
I'm going to ask you one time,

20:18.016 --> 20:21.887
politely, who killed Dan Mason?

20:29.394 --> 20:33.863
And I'm gonna tell you once,
to get the fuck out of here,

20:33.865 --> 20:36.969
or you're a dead
man, you got it?

20:41.071 --> 20:42.273
Everyone.

20:44.642 --> 20:46.342
Everyone, listen.

20:46.344 --> 20:48.279
There's totally
going to be a fight.

20:49.646 --> 20:50.979
Come on.

20:50.981 --> 20:52.480
Fucking fight,
fucking brilliant.

20:52.482 --> 20:54.417
What's she talking about?

20:54.419 --> 20:55.651
You wanna have a look?

20:55.653 --> 20:57.623
- A fight?
- Let's go have a look.

20:59.891 --> 21:02.694
Look, we're trying to
be reasonable here, we...

21:23.847 --> 21:25.017
We're done here.

21:36.426 --> 21:38.062
Must I repeat myself?

21:57.115 --> 21:57.915
Trouble?

22:00.017 --> 22:01.950
Just some random prick.

22:01.952 --> 22:05.153
You're in over your head, so
consider this a fair warning.

22:05.155 --> 22:07.922
Leave Devotion and
don't come back.

22:07.924 --> 22:08.926
Do I make myself clear?

22:19.737 --> 22:20.870
Let's go.

22:20.872 --> 22:23.375
Come on people, show's over.

22:31.749 --> 22:32.750
You okay?

22:37.989 --> 22:38.789
Mister?

22:42.559 --> 22:43.361
Tip-top.

22:48.031 --> 22:49.565
Look I couldn't say anything

22:49.567 --> 22:55.537
back in there but
I knew Dan Mason.

22:55.539 --> 22:56.705
Yeah, and if you
just come with me

22:56.707 --> 22:58.540
I can tell you everything.

22:58.542 --> 22:59.810
Seriously, I can help.

23:01.112 --> 23:02.545
Fine.

23:02.547 --> 23:03.714
Come on Sis.

23:13.657 --> 23:16.491
I'll have that vodka now then.

23:16.493 --> 23:17.959
- Sure.
- Really?

23:27.471 --> 23:32.574
Danny Mason was a good
man, quite a gentleman.

23:32.576 --> 23:34.779
I'm Sandra by the
way, what's your name?

23:37.080 --> 23:38.780
Suit yourself.

23:38.782 --> 23:40.216
Do you like music?

23:40.218 --> 23:41.683
What kind of music do you like?

23:41.685 --> 23:42.684
Here we go.

23:55.700 --> 23:57.766
How did you know Dan?

23:57.768 --> 24:00.236
Oh, just from the pub really.

24:00.238 --> 24:02.505
He was nice though, tipped well.

24:02.507 --> 24:05.074
What do you know
about all of this?

24:05.076 --> 24:07.575
Oh, just what Keith's
told me to be honest.

24:07.577 --> 24:08.180
Sounds awful.

24:10.548 --> 24:11.779
Keith?

24:11.781 --> 24:13.615
Yeah he's my friend.

24:13.617 --> 24:15.183
We help each other out and that.

24:15.185 --> 24:16.619
He's lovely.

24:16.621 --> 24:18.187
What does Keith
know about Dan?

24:18.189 --> 24:19.988
Oh, I didn't really
ask him much after

24:19.990 --> 24:21.590
he told me what
happened to be honest.

24:21.592 --> 24:22.928
I was a bit freaked out
actually.

24:24.228 --> 24:26.661
Take me to him.

24:26.663 --> 24:29.597
Oh well, Keith mostly keeps
himself to himself these days,

24:29.599 --> 24:31.068
I doubt he knows
anything at all.

24:32.803 --> 24:34.039
Yep, nope, fine.

24:44.248 --> 24:45.547
Bollocks.

24:48.818 --> 24:50.521
It's open, come through.

24:53.624 --> 24:54.890
Hiya Keith.

24:54.892 --> 24:56.292
Ah Sandra,
Sandra babe, thank God.

24:56.294 --> 24:58.160
You got my rollies?

24:58.162 --> 25:00.763
Who's this, Sandra?

25:00.765 --> 25:02.765
No don't worry it's alright.

25:02.767 --> 25:04.099
He's alright.

25:04.101 --> 25:06.238
So this is Keith,
and Keith, this is...

25:08.105 --> 25:10.305
You alright mate,
how you doing?

25:10.307 --> 25:12.807
- Better than some.
- Oh what, these?

25:12.809 --> 25:14.642
Yeah I'm lucky I've got
Sandra to look after me.

25:14.644 --> 25:16.679
She's my own personal angel,
ain't you, babe?

25:16.681 --> 25:18.115
Come and give Keithy some sugar.

25:21.318 --> 25:23.254
Keith.

25:24.622 --> 25:25.657
Sit yourself down mate.

25:27.758 --> 25:28.790
So who are you anyway?

25:28.792 --> 25:30.094
Army, police, crew, what?

25:31.828 --> 25:32.630
Sandra?

25:33.998 --> 25:34.997
None of the above.

25:34.999 --> 25:36.798
Well saints be praised.

25:36.800 --> 25:38.033
You got a...

25:38.035 --> 25:39.271
- Here, give us a light, babe.
- Oh.

25:40.837 --> 25:43.104
So what can I do you for?

25:43.106 --> 25:47.709
Two days ago, my friend Sergeant
Daniel Mason was killed.

25:47.711 --> 25:49.678
I'm here to find whoever did it.

25:49.680 --> 25:51.779
Sandra seems to think you
might be able to help me.

25:51.781 --> 25:53.248
Whoa whoa whoa whoa,
slow your roll mate.

25:53.250 --> 25:55.383
What makes you think I know
anything about anything?

25:55.385 --> 25:58.022
Oh well, I kind of
told him that you did.

25:59.957 --> 26:02.190
So what do you know?

26:02.192 --> 26:04.727
Look mate, I can see you're upset,
but honest I can't help you.

26:04.729 --> 26:06.894
Sandra gets a bit
fucking divvy sometimes.

26:06.896 --> 26:07.962
I'm sorry about your pal.

26:09.333 --> 26:11.299
- What are you doing?
- What do you know?

26:11.301 --> 26:12.267
Get him the fuck off me.

26:12.269 --> 26:13.835
Stop, please.

26:13.837 --> 26:15.105
Sit, down.

26:16.973 --> 26:18.609
Okay, okay, okay, let me just.

26:20.010 --> 26:21.643
Start talking.

26:21.645 --> 26:23.711
Well everything was cool
until about a month ago.

26:23.713 --> 26:25.847
I had all of the business in
town, and it was all good.

26:25.849 --> 26:28.851
When all of a sudden some
new faces rock up and,

26:28.853 --> 26:30.986
I'm telling you man, these
geezers were heavy man,

26:30.988 --> 26:32.921
they were fucking heavy duty.

26:32.923 --> 26:35.056
They made me take their product.

26:35.058 --> 26:36.260
Can I get up now?

26:37.728 --> 26:38.330
Sure.

26:42.732 --> 26:43.335
Hey.

26:46.303 --> 26:47.105
Continue.

26:48.739 --> 26:50.171
Well things were
alright at first,

26:50.173 --> 26:51.974
but then all of a
sudden I'm told until

26:51.976 --> 26:54.008
I pay them off every
penny goes to them.

26:54.010 --> 26:55.811
So one minute it's all good,

26:55.813 --> 26:58.180
the next I'm working for free,
and who wants that?

26:58.182 --> 26:59.948
And when I say
something about it,

26:59.950 --> 27:02.151
they fucking did this to me,
and kicked me out my gaff.

27:02.153 --> 27:05.853
So now I'm not working
and I've got nothing.

27:05.855 --> 27:07.826
If I didn't have Sandra,
God only knows mate.

27:09.192 --> 27:10.726
It's not all
bad though, is it?

27:10.728 --> 27:11.962
Some silver linings.

27:13.163 --> 27:15.698
Who are they, where are they?

27:15.700 --> 27:17.165
Come on bruv, they'll kill me.

27:18.035 --> 27:19.802
I'll kill you.

27:19.804 --> 27:20.969
Please, stop it.

27:20.971 --> 27:22.071
Tell me.

27:22.073 --> 27:24.238
Hatcher, his name's Hatcher.

27:24.240 --> 27:27.476
Hatcher, as in
Sergeant George Hatcher?

27:27.478 --> 27:28.977
What, you know him?

27:28.979 --> 27:30.312
Nah, bollocks,
I don't want nothing

27:30.314 --> 27:32.146
to do with this
if you fucking know him.

27:32.148 --> 27:35.383
Hang on, what would a highly
trained special forces team

27:35.385 --> 27:38.319
want with a broken
town like Devotion?

27:38.321 --> 27:40.255
Well look around you, no
one gives a shit about us.

27:40.257 --> 27:43.324
They can do what they want
here, no one's gonna stop them.

27:43.326 --> 27:46.128
- Here my love.
- Thanks babe.

27:46.130 --> 27:48.700
I mean, who's gonna mess with
the special fucking forces?

27:53.903 --> 27:54.705
Who?

27:58.241 --> 28:00.174
What, you?

28:00.176 --> 28:01.809
Well fucking good luck
with that one mate,

28:01.811 --> 28:03.277
we'll have you fitted
up for a coffin

28:03.279 --> 28:04.949
in the morning if you want,
save you the bother.

28:06.317 --> 28:07.783
Where do I find Hatcher?

28:07.785 --> 28:08.851
Take your pick.

28:08.853 --> 28:10.518
My old place, the army barracks,

28:10.520 --> 28:13.521
the Devotion Women's
fucking Institute.

28:13.523 --> 28:14.825
He's everywhere.

28:18.528 --> 28:20.198
You, don't leave town.

28:21.898 --> 28:24.099
We're leaving.

28:24.101 --> 28:25.933
Sandra.

28:25.935 --> 28:27.071
Sandra, babe.

28:30.875 --> 28:31.476
Sandra.

28:33.978 --> 28:34.778
Sandra.

28:39.115 --> 28:39.917
Fuck.

28:42.051 --> 28:43.285
You know, you didn't
have to hurt him.

28:43.287 --> 28:45.187
He'll live.

28:45.189 --> 28:47.989
Where's Hatcher
peddling his drugs from?

28:47.991 --> 28:49.123
Well it's at
Keith's old place,

28:49.125 --> 28:50.459
but it's a proper shit-hole and

28:50.461 --> 28:51.526
you know what I
really don't think

28:51.528 --> 28:53.128
you want to go there right now.

28:53.130 --> 28:54.462
Show it to me.

28:54.464 --> 28:56.064
Have you got a death
wish or something?

28:56.066 --> 28:57.035
Just take me there.

28:58.134 --> 28:58.936
Fine.

29:02.173 --> 29:04.273
But it's your funeral.

29:20.324 --> 29:22.927
This is it, told you.

29:28.932 --> 29:30.134
What the...

29:34.337 --> 29:35.807
What's he doing here?

29:39.576 --> 29:42.944
Not you mate, jog on.

29:42.946 --> 29:44.246
Are you deaf or something?

29:44.248 --> 29:48.316
I said jog, the fuck, on.

29:48.318 --> 29:49.852
Yeah sorry,
I think they're just

29:49.854 --> 29:51.221
being a bit paranoid
or something.

29:54.090 --> 29:56.324
Wait, wait, wait, no, no, no.

29:56.326 --> 29:58.192
They know me here so
maybe I should just

29:58.194 --> 30:00.464
buy something so we
don't seem suspicious.

30:02.232 --> 30:03.067
Right.

30:20.217 --> 30:21.853
I'm going, alright.

30:31.060 --> 30:32.297
Alright, come up.

31:15.538 --> 31:18.606
Hello, me again, how are you?

31:18.608 --> 31:19.644
I knew you'd be back.

31:22.145 --> 31:23.444
How many?

31:23.446 --> 31:26.081
Just the one please.

31:37.027 --> 31:37.629
Two.

31:56.713 --> 31:59.081
Yeah it's me.

31:59.083 --> 32:01.219
Our new friend from the
pub has just shown up here.

32:03.053 --> 32:04.251
No, I'm not fucking
shitting you,

32:04.253 --> 32:05.355
what do you want
me to do about it?

32:19.569 --> 32:22.770
Thanks so much, see you soon.

32:22.772 --> 32:24.041
Not so fast.

32:31.147 --> 32:33.517
Oh, hi guys, you alright?

32:44.728 --> 32:47.129
Your friend, who is he?

32:47.131 --> 32:49.096
I don't know, I've
never met him before.

32:49.098 --> 32:50.565
Oh don't fuck me about, Sandra.

32:50.567 --> 32:51.799
I swear,
I've never seen him

32:51.801 --> 32:53.403
before he came in
the pub tonight.

33:02.112 --> 33:04.645
Well, I wanna know
where he's staying.

33:04.647 --> 33:06.416
You'll find that out
for me, won't you?

33:07.550 --> 33:08.586
- I mean...
- Look at me.

33:10.119 --> 33:12.054
Look at me.

33:12.056 --> 33:13.555
Now I don't care what
you have to do, Sandra,

33:13.557 --> 33:16.324
but you'll find out
where he's staying,

33:16.326 --> 33:17.327
and then you'll
tell me, won't you?

33:19.829 --> 33:20.630
Won't you?

33:34.278 --> 33:35.544
All done.

33:35.546 --> 33:37.711
Subtle, what about the police?

33:37.713 --> 33:38.680
What about them?

33:38.682 --> 33:41.019
Sandra, talk to me.

33:43.153 --> 33:48.489
You said it yourself, okay,
Devotion is a broken place.

33:48.491 --> 33:49.757
You try going to the
next police station,

33:49.759 --> 33:52.427
which is three towns
over by the way,

33:52.429 --> 33:53.661
see if they'll
take your statement

33:53.663 --> 33:56.297
for getting threatened
outside the pub.

33:56.299 --> 33:58.432
Our local copper was in there,
for fuck's sake.

33:58.434 --> 33:59.734
Did you see him?

33:59.736 --> 34:01.702
Did he even lift a finger
to help you,

34:01.704 --> 34:03.374
stop you causing
a scene outside?

34:05.108 --> 34:06.644
People around here,
they're scared.

34:08.311 --> 34:10.143
Georgie Freeman said he
was going to the police

34:10.146 --> 34:11.512
after that lot set
his car on fire

34:11.514 --> 34:14.382
and we never saw him again.

34:14.384 --> 34:15.186
Do you get it?

34:20.157 --> 34:20.757
Let's go.

34:32.735 --> 34:36.338
Look, I'm sorry I got
angry earlier alright?

34:36.340 --> 34:37.737
Are you sure this
is the right way?

34:37.739 --> 34:39.242
There's nothing but
fields out here.

34:41.411 --> 34:42.813
You don't talk much, do you?

34:50.753 --> 34:53.353
Oh, it's lovely.

34:53.356 --> 34:55.356
Got an en suite in there?

34:55.358 --> 34:56.623
When did you last see Dan?

34:56.626 --> 34:58.360
Oh.

34:58.362 --> 35:02.664
Well, it was, a couple of
days before he, you know.

35:02.666 --> 35:04.568
It was horrible what
happened isn't it?

35:07.670 --> 35:09.539
It's gonna be bloody
freezing in there.

35:12.242 --> 35:17.148
I could come in for
a bit, if you like?

35:19.382 --> 35:20.250
Go home, Sandra.

36:54.811 --> 36:56.247
July the fifth.

36:59.483 --> 37:00.418
Thank you my darling.

37:02.385 --> 37:04.753
Dan has been in contact
with the county police,

37:04.755 --> 37:08.389
and it would appear that the
drug business in Devotion

37:08.391 --> 37:10.791
has gone through the roof
since Hatcher set up shop.

37:10.793 --> 37:13.528
Background on Hatcher's team.

37:13.530 --> 37:16.363
Barnes is his second in command.

37:16.365 --> 37:18.599
She worked harder than all
of her male counterparts

37:18.601 --> 37:20.769
to achieve rank,
and it would appear

37:20.771 --> 37:24.275
that her long term ambition
was to join under Hatcher.

37:26.309 --> 37:29.543
Marshall has made a career
out of being a psychopath.

37:32.048 --> 37:35.050
Countless reports of him
assaulting unarmed civilians

37:35.052 --> 37:38.653
in foreign climes,
and other heinous acts

37:38.655 --> 37:40.858
all somehow
overturned by Hatcher.

37:42.893 --> 37:43.728
Stockwell.

37:45.695 --> 37:48.662
Stockwell's hair trigger
temper has seen him

37:48.664 --> 37:50.764
pulled up on charges
of insubordination

37:50.766 --> 37:53.068
in every unit that he
has ever served in,

37:53.070 --> 37:58.943
until Hatcher took him under
his wing and gave him focus.

38:03.914 --> 38:06.780
And Lambert, he's
beaten everyone there

38:06.782 --> 38:09.586
is to beat in the area
of unarmed combat.

38:32.476 --> 38:34.409
Congratulations Lambert.

38:34.411 --> 38:37.715
Hatcher's men are
utterly loyal to him.

38:39.449 --> 38:40.981
July the 17th.

38:40.983 --> 38:43.418
Dan suspects that Hatcher's
been doing business

38:43.420 --> 38:47.856
with a notorious drugs cartel
run by one Sonia Larsson.

38:47.858 --> 38:49.727
She's as ruthless as they come.

38:51.994 --> 38:55.963
Been on watchlists for years,
but thus far untouchable.

38:55.965 --> 38:57.132
Ettie.

38:57.134 --> 38:59.036
Don't water them darling.

39:28.532 --> 39:30.701
Shit, shit, shit.

39:55.992 --> 39:57.057
Hi.

39:57.059 --> 39:58.459
Hi, yeah it's me.

39:58.461 --> 39:59.726
I...

39:59.728 --> 40:01.528
Yeah, I'm sorry.

40:01.530 --> 40:03.733
I'm sorry I was just, I'm sorry
I was late, I, yeah, no.

40:07.137 --> 40:11.142
It's the blue barn
on Hobden Rise.

40:13.876 --> 40:17.612
No, I didn't see anyone else.
I didn't see anyone else.

40:17.614 --> 40:22.717
Listen, you're not... you're
not gonna hurt him, are you?

40:22.719 --> 40:24.621
Only, last time.

41:52.074 --> 41:56.209
Okay, we grab the
target and we're gone.

41:56.211 --> 41:58.681
Nice and easy, on me.

42:17.967 --> 42:18.768
Stop.

42:21.338 --> 42:22.806
God's sake, stop.

42:25.708 --> 42:27.877
Shit, where is he?

42:29.846 --> 42:30.945
I'll call it in.

42:30.947 --> 42:32.713
Bollocks, look what he's done.

42:32.715 --> 42:34.585
Let's just make
sure he's dead then.

42:50.065 --> 42:51.733
Where are you?

43:08.652 --> 43:10.717
You're gonna give
Hatcher a message from me.

43:10.719 --> 43:12.052
Fuck you.

43:33.876 --> 43:34.911
The balls on the man.

43:36.880 --> 43:40.180
We give him a verbal warning
and he kills four of ours.

43:40.182 --> 43:41.849
Hardly a proportionate response.

43:41.851 --> 43:45.222
I knew it, we should have
finished him at the pub.

43:48.391 --> 43:50.157
What do we have on him?

43:50.159 --> 43:52.025
I ran that through the system,

43:52.027 --> 43:55.762
and there's a match for his
face from about five years ago,

43:55.764 --> 44:00.333
but his files indicate that he's been
classified as a priority target.

44:00.335 --> 44:01.802
Anything else?

44:01.804 --> 44:02.739
I'm working on it.

44:18.822 --> 44:20.188
Morning.

44:20.190 --> 44:21.125
What can I get you?

44:23.425 --> 44:24.761
Go clean up out back.

44:26.829 --> 44:27.431
Violet.

44:31.967 --> 44:32.769
Morning.

44:37.407 --> 44:39.009
She's at that difficult age, eh?

44:43.346 --> 44:44.412
How's business Rose?

44:44.414 --> 44:45.282
It's fine thanks.

44:48.050 --> 44:49.150
How much for this one?

44:49.152 --> 44:50.351
It's not for sale.

44:50.353 --> 44:52.353
Says 30 quid.

44:52.355 --> 44:54.255
Look, what do
you actually want?

44:54.257 --> 44:56.356
That loudmouth at
the pub last night.

44:56.358 --> 44:57.492
Apparently you told him he could

44:57.494 --> 44:59.360
come here if he wants to chat.

44:59.362 --> 45:00.862
Everyone's welcome here.

45:00.864 --> 45:04.264
To eat, drink, chat, whatever.

45:04.266 --> 45:06.400
He just seemed upset.

45:06.402 --> 45:09.202
And how exactly are you
going to brighten up his day?

45:10.472 --> 45:11.505
I hadn't actually
thought about...

45:11.507 --> 45:12.742
Breakfast would be a start.

45:15.778 --> 45:17.146
Oh, hiya.

45:18.514 --> 45:22.883
- Morning.
- Morning, everything okay?

45:22.885 --> 45:24.885
She's fine.

45:46.141 --> 45:47.208
Rose, is it?

45:47.210 --> 45:48.876
Am I too late to get breakfast?

45:48.878 --> 45:52.813
That's right,
and we serve breakfast all day.

45:52.815 --> 45:55.316
Just take a seat,
and I'll be right with you.

45:55.318 --> 45:56.416
Coffee, tea?

45:56.418 --> 45:57.221
Coffee please.

45:59.121 --> 46:00.487
Black, no sugar?

46:00.489 --> 46:01.956
Good guess.

46:01.958 --> 46:04.193
Expert me, my
specialist subject.

46:09.898 --> 46:11.932
- There you go.
- Thanks.

46:11.934 --> 46:13.934
Well you know my name.

46:13.936 --> 46:14.901
What's yours?

46:14.903 --> 46:15.873
Oh, John.

46:17.005 --> 46:17.807
Just John?

46:20.210 --> 46:23.112
Well, just John,
what can I get you?

46:28.918 --> 46:30.351
You know, it all looks good.

46:30.353 --> 46:32.320
Surprise me.

46:32.322 --> 46:33.423
Right you are.

46:58.380 --> 46:59.380
Do you like it?

46:59.382 --> 47:00.250
Who's the artist?

47:01.550 --> 47:04.153
She's an excellent cook.

47:06.989 --> 47:11.092
So, how well did you
know the Mason family?

47:11.094 --> 47:13.197
About as well as I
know any of our regulars.

47:14.664 --> 47:17.632
Ettie was very picky
about her food.

47:17.634 --> 47:23.237
Dougie would clean
the plate, and Dan,

47:23.239 --> 47:26.641
he was somewhere in between,
liked everything burned though.

47:26.643 --> 47:28.278
Sounds like Dan.

47:30.413 --> 47:33.380
You know, don't take
this the wrong way,

47:33.382 --> 47:35.983
but you don't seem to
fit into this town.

47:35.985 --> 47:37.952
Meaning?

47:37.954 --> 47:38.555
You're nice.

47:40.155 --> 47:41.155
Thanks.

47:41.157 --> 47:42.389
Wasn't a compliment.

47:42.391 --> 47:43.990
Devotion, this whole place,

47:43.992 --> 47:45.862
has really nosedived
since I last came here.

47:46.963 --> 47:49.396
And how long ago was that?

47:49.398 --> 47:52.599
The point is, all the nice
people have moved away, so.

47:52.601 --> 47:54.434
What am I still doing here?

47:54.436 --> 47:55.936
There's not much to tell.

47:55.938 --> 47:57.373
Dad used to run
the place with Mum.

47:59.041 --> 48:01.612
And I helped him
after she passed,

48:03.079 --> 48:05.412
until he joined her last year.

48:05.414 --> 48:07.217
This is all I've got
left of them really.

48:09.018 --> 48:11.054
Someone's got to look
after trouble over there.

48:14.456 --> 48:16.624
She drives me mental sometimes,

48:16.626 --> 48:18.929
but she's all the
family I've got left.

48:21.364 --> 48:23.030
You ever think about
moving somewhere...

48:23.032 --> 48:24.731
- Nice?
- Mmm.

48:24.733 --> 48:29.036
Yeah, sure, but everything's
tied up in this place,

48:29.038 --> 48:30.503
and Devotion's
not exactly overrun

48:30.505 --> 48:33.009
with people wanting
to buy property, so...

48:43.485 --> 48:44.719
What can you tell me about

48:44.721 --> 48:46.354
my friends from
the pub last night?

48:46.356 --> 48:48.125
Thinking of causing
more trouble then?

48:51.327 --> 48:55.329
Look, all I know is they walk around
here like they own the place.

48:55.331 --> 48:57.601
My friends and I do what we can
to stay out of their way.

49:10.480 --> 49:12.248
This is too much for...

49:13.682 --> 49:15.318
Oh, thanks.

49:18.420 --> 49:22.789
I know you probably want
justice for the Mason family,

49:22.791 --> 49:25.092
but you might want to think
about leaving town.

49:25.094 --> 49:28.128
Thanks, it's not
justice I'm after.

49:28.130 --> 49:31.268
You're right by the way,
the artist is an excellent cook.

49:33.101 --> 49:34.170
Keep out of trouble you.

49:43.045 --> 49:44.280
That was utterly sickening.

50:21.684 --> 50:22.486
Hello Sandra.

50:24.152 --> 50:28.488
Jesus, what, I,
what're you, get, no.

50:38.733 --> 50:41.237
What's she doing back here?

50:44.440 --> 50:45.275
Come up.

50:53.215 --> 50:55.583
I want a word with you.

50:55.585 --> 50:56.485
Move.

50:58.621 --> 51:00.354
Or?

51:00.356 --> 51:02.255
Or I'm gonna
decorate this place

51:02.257 --> 51:04.493
in a delicate shade of
your skull and brain.

51:08.331 --> 51:09.132
You too.

51:10.465 --> 51:12.101
Alright, just
don't shoot yeah?

51:13.469 --> 51:14.503
There's a lot of
flammable shit in here.

51:17.706 --> 51:18.738
You little shit.

51:18.740 --> 51:20.773
I'm sorry, he made me.

51:20.775 --> 51:22.511
- Concentrate.
- Easy.

51:24.646 --> 51:27.817
No one has to die, just take
what you want and leave.

51:34.556 --> 51:36.456
You.

51:36.458 --> 51:39.193
Look it weren't personal at
the pub, it was just business.

51:39.195 --> 51:40.628
Shit, we were trying
to do you a favor.

51:40.630 --> 51:42.162
You got no idea who
you're messing with...

51:42.164 --> 51:43.166
I said concentrate.

51:50.239 --> 51:51.771
Sandra, don't.

51:51.773 --> 51:53.542
But I just, I just...

52:55.737 --> 52:57.670
I fucking warned
you Sandra, now you're cut off.

52:57.672 --> 52:59.440
Get off me.

52:59.442 --> 53:02.778
- I'm gonna fucking kill you!
- Oh fucking Jesus.

53:05.447 --> 53:06.315
Kill you.

53:07.483 --> 53:09.682
I'm gonna kill you!

53:09.684 --> 53:10.818
Crazy.

53:32.807 --> 53:33.677
Drop it.

53:41.617 --> 53:43.820
Jesus Christ, look at the
mess you've made here.

53:45.987 --> 53:47.256
Oh, sorry.

53:50.626 --> 53:51.428
You.

53:52.994 --> 53:54.563
Oi, Sandra, I'm talking to you.

53:59.034 --> 54:00.501
You want another hit?

54:00.503 --> 54:02.271
Bring me that phone over there.

54:03.706 --> 54:04.574
Sandra, don't.

54:05.807 --> 54:06.610
Do it now.

54:08.777 --> 54:09.980
Come on, now!

54:13.416 --> 54:14.417
Sandra.

54:26.429 --> 54:28.061
I'll deal with you later.

54:28.063 --> 54:30.998
As for you, dickhead, you should
have left town when I told you.

54:31.000 --> 54:32.032
Now you're gonna...

54:45.780 --> 54:49.083
Now then, an elite
special forces team

54:49.085 --> 54:51.452
turn gutter level drug barons.

54:51.454 --> 54:52.552
Discuss.

54:52.554 --> 54:53.389
Get fucked.

54:54.590 --> 54:56.593
Come on, out with it.

54:58.126 --> 55:00.661
We were sent to Afghanistan

55:00.663 --> 55:02.963
to take down a major drug lord.

55:02.965 --> 55:04.664
We intercepted him on
a private airstrip,

55:04.666 --> 55:07.101
and when we were done,
it was just sitting there.

55:07.103 --> 55:08.369
It?

55:08.371 --> 55:10.771
A massive block of heroin.

55:10.773 --> 55:13.440
Enough junk to set us all up
for the rest of our lives.

55:13.442 --> 55:14.675
And?

55:14.677 --> 55:15.812
And we talked about it.

55:16.978 --> 55:19.012
Hatcher's never seen us wrong.

55:19.014 --> 55:21.447
He saw it as our
retirement plan.

55:21.449 --> 55:23.450
So you smuggle it back

55:23.452 --> 55:25.418
and take over the
local drug supply.

55:25.420 --> 55:27.423
Boss figured it'd be
the best way to start.

55:28.990 --> 55:31.027
Plus what do we know
about selling this shit?

55:32.994 --> 55:35.764
So we found a local
supplier and squeezed...

55:42.103 --> 55:43.939
Tell me about Dan Mason.

55:45.673 --> 55:47.076
He found out
what we were up to.

55:48.577 --> 55:49.742
Knew we were setting up a deal

55:49.744 --> 55:51.445
to sell the shit
on to Amsterdam.

55:51.447 --> 55:52.048
Go on.

55:54.849 --> 55:55.951
Why don't you ask her?

55:57.552 --> 55:59.119
Or that sick loser
she hangs around with.

55:59.121 --> 56:02.155
No, no, I didn't do,
we didn't do anything.

56:02.157 --> 56:03.791
What's he talking about?

56:28.784 --> 56:30.387
Wait, what're you doing?

56:32.954 --> 56:35.789
Oh my God, are you crazy?

56:35.791 --> 56:37.858
No, no, no, no, no, you don't...
you don't have to do this, okay?

56:37.860 --> 56:39.592
I don't know what
they said to you,

56:39.594 --> 56:41.663
I swear, I swear.
Please, please don't do this.

56:51.039 --> 56:52.909
You're crazy, please just stop.

57:11.126 --> 57:11.928
Oh my God.

57:14.230 --> 57:15.595
Let's go.

57:15.597 --> 57:16.996
Shit.

57:37.519 --> 57:40.222
Jesus fucking Christ,
they are gonna kill you.

57:50.965 --> 57:51.768
It's me.

57:52.902 --> 57:53.869
Yeah he's still here.

57:56.871 --> 57:58.204
He just killed some soldiers

57:58.206 --> 57:59.975
and set fire to the
local drug factory.

58:02.945 --> 58:04.514
No, I don't know that yet.

58:06.047 --> 58:07.649
No, I don't know that either.

58:10.920 --> 58:13.088
Yes, yes of course.

58:15.023 --> 58:16.322
I just said yes.

58:16.324 --> 58:17.758
Why the hell would
I drive all the way

58:17.760 --> 58:18.928
down here, then
not tell you when...

58:22.565 --> 58:24.701
Of course, I didn't mean to...

58:28.637 --> 58:32.039
Why is everybody
pissing me off today?

58:32.041 --> 58:37.244
He's an honest-to-God, real
life hero, or at least he was.

58:37.246 --> 58:40.347
John Gold, military cross.

58:40.349 --> 58:43.182
Back in the day he
single-handedly neutralized

58:43.184 --> 58:44.918
more insurgents in one year

58:44.920 --> 58:46.686
than the rest of his
section put together.

58:46.688 --> 58:48.822
He was a one man war machine.

58:48.824 --> 58:50.791
He all but disappeared
just over three years ago

58:50.793 --> 58:53.693
and he's been completely
off grid ever since.

58:53.695 --> 58:55.329
There've been rumors
of him appearing

58:55.331 --> 58:58.835
in serious hotspots here and
there, but nothing verifiable.

58:59.835 --> 59:01.668
Why'd he leave?

59:01.670 --> 59:04.371
I'm still working on that,
but it had something to do

59:04.373 --> 59:07.340
with an op in Eastern
Europe going sideways.

59:07.342 --> 59:09.278
Total disaster by all accounts.

59:11.246 --> 59:12.912
Focus on his return.

59:12.914 --> 59:14.715
Well it's not official.

59:14.717 --> 59:16.818
No authorizations
for him on the system.

59:18.353 --> 59:21.854
The only real connection
is he served with Dan Mason

59:21.856 --> 59:26.126
a few years ago, and Mason
senior was their instructor.

59:26.128 --> 59:27.327
It's personal.

59:27.329 --> 59:29.028
Yeah.

59:29.030 --> 59:31.197
That's good,
no reprisals from above.

59:31.199 --> 59:33.367
We eliminate him, we move on.

59:33.369 --> 59:35.302
Job done.

59:35.304 --> 59:36.869
Please don't, no.

59:36.871 --> 59:38.104
Please, I'll do
anything you want.

59:38.106 --> 59:39.373
I'll do anything you want.

59:39.375 --> 59:40.208
Yeah.

59:42.077 --> 59:44.378
Hold on, I'm putting
you on speaker.

59:44.380 --> 59:46.746
I said, the
place has been burned to shit,

59:46.748 --> 59:48.414
and Lambert and the others
have been wiped out.

59:48.416 --> 59:51.150
Reckon it'll take 48 hours
to get up and running again.

59:51.152 --> 59:54.121
This prick just seriously
cut into our productivity.

59:54.123 --> 59:56.889
Name's John Gold, ex-regiment.

59:56.891 --> 01:00:00.126
Turn over our local
contacts, find him.

01:00:00.128 --> 01:00:03.664
Stockwell, if you do
find him do not engage.

01:00:03.666 --> 01:00:07.733
Report back for orders
first, is that clear?

01:00:07.735 --> 01:00:09.038
Roger that.

01:00:16.945 --> 01:00:17.747
Marshall.

01:00:20.416 --> 01:00:21.651
Think strategically.

01:00:25.286 --> 01:00:28.188
There's no point in all of
you chasing Gold around town.

01:00:28.190 --> 01:00:31.191
Get ahead of him,
what does he want?

01:00:31.193 --> 01:00:33.159
Us, apparently.

01:00:33.161 --> 01:00:34.760
Exactly that.

01:00:34.762 --> 01:00:37.164
One way or another
he's coming after us,

01:00:37.166 --> 01:00:40.166
and then we'll deal with him.

01:00:52.780 --> 01:00:54.317
Wakey wakey, Keith.

01:00:55.951 --> 01:00:59.389
Not now, Sandra, later babe.

01:01:15.237 --> 01:01:20.340
Shit, Sandra, where is she?

01:01:20.342 --> 01:01:22.108
Tell me about Dan.

01:01:22.110 --> 01:01:24.811
Told you before, I had
nothing to do with your mate.

01:01:24.813 --> 01:01:26.847
You know more
than you've told me.

01:01:26.849 --> 01:01:28.949
About what? I don't even
know what you're on about.

01:01:28.951 --> 01:01:30.217
Sandra set me up this morning.

01:01:30.219 --> 01:01:31.952
Mate, I don't
even know, I swear.

01:01:31.954 --> 01:01:33.487
You set up Dan too?

01:01:33.489 --> 01:01:35.889
No, no, no, no, no.
Don't, don't, please.

01:01:35.891 --> 01:01:37.958
I didn't do anything.

01:01:37.960 --> 01:01:39.992
Think I haven't
seen all this before?

01:01:39.994 --> 01:01:43.362
I know what you are, what
you've done, what you deserve.

01:01:43.364 --> 01:01:45.164
What, Sandra?

01:01:45.166 --> 01:01:47.833
I look after her. I look after
her, and she looks after me!

01:01:47.835 --> 01:01:49.802
For fuck's sake, just ask her!

01:01:49.804 --> 01:01:52.072
She didn't stand a chance
with you around.

01:01:52.074 --> 01:01:55.876
But I'm gonna give you an
opportunity to do one good thing.

01:01:55.878 --> 01:01:57.276
Tell me what happened to Dan.

01:01:57.278 --> 01:01:59.412
I keep telling
you I don't know.

01:01:59.414 --> 01:02:01.014
I don't know, I don't know.

01:02:01.016 --> 01:02:02.382
For fuck's sake, if you
want me to say something

01:02:02.384 --> 01:02:04.517
just tell me and
I'll fucking say it,

01:02:04.519 --> 01:02:06.855
but I swear to God I had
nothing to do with your mate.

01:02:12.126 --> 01:02:14.860
Next one goes
right here, talk.

01:02:14.862 --> 01:02:16.765
Okay, okay,
alright, just listen.

01:02:18.266 --> 01:02:20.133
Dan found out about
some deal Hatcher

01:02:20.135 --> 01:02:23.068
was doing with this
big time Dutch cartel.

01:02:23.070 --> 01:02:25.237
Tulips and shit.

01:02:25.239 --> 01:02:27.240
He told Sandra he was
gonna report Hatcher

01:02:27.242 --> 01:02:30.409
to the fucking high
command or whatever.

01:02:30.411 --> 01:02:32.112
He liked her, he trusted her.

01:02:32.114 --> 01:02:33.380
He told her to get out of town

01:02:33.382 --> 01:02:35.347
and lay low until
it all blew over.

01:02:35.349 --> 01:02:36.883
But she didn't,
she came and told me

01:02:36.885 --> 01:02:38.284
'cause she wanted
me to go with her,

01:02:38.286 --> 01:02:41.188
'cause I told you
she worries about me.

01:02:41.190 --> 01:02:46.025
So yeah, I went to Hatcher.

01:02:46.027 --> 01:02:49.329
I thought if I helped
him out he might

01:02:49.331 --> 01:02:51.197
cut me back in on my
old patch, you know?

01:02:51.199 --> 01:02:53.066
Please, please.

01:02:53.068 --> 01:02:54.467
I've got nothing mate,
they've taken everything from me

01:02:54.469 --> 01:02:55.969
and I just wanted
something for myself.

01:02:55.971 --> 01:02:57.239
Please, please.

01:03:00.576 --> 01:03:02.275
Go on.

01:03:02.277 --> 01:03:04.577
When they found out
that Dan trusted Sandra,

01:03:04.579 --> 01:03:06.246
they had her tell him
about the meeting Hatcher

01:03:06.248 --> 01:03:08.615
was having with the cartel.

01:03:08.617 --> 01:03:10.950
But obviously it was a setup,
they knew he was coming.

01:03:10.952 --> 01:03:14.389
She told me about it
after they, you know.

01:03:16.458 --> 01:03:19.124
But honest to God, she didn't
know what they was gonna do,

01:03:19.126 --> 01:03:21.494
she just thought they was gonna
run him out of town or something.

01:03:21.496 --> 01:03:22.831
She wouldn't hurt
a fly, that one.

01:03:27.536 --> 01:03:30.139
So what, what're you gonna do?

01:03:40.081 --> 01:03:42.014
Oh please don't
fucking please don't.

01:03:42.016 --> 01:03:43.383
I told you what
you wanted to know,

01:03:43.385 --> 01:03:45.418
please don't kill me, man.

01:03:45.420 --> 01:03:47.487
Please, I'll
fucking do anything.

01:03:47.489 --> 01:03:49.389
Please, please.

01:03:59.601 --> 01:04:03.039
Oh my good God, oh my God.

01:04:05.974 --> 01:04:06.976
Keithie's got to move.

01:04:35.269 --> 01:04:36.304
Fine.

01:04:47.648 --> 01:04:50.215
Oh, I could barely
breathe in there.

01:04:50.217 --> 01:04:51.483
Are you alright?

01:04:51.485 --> 01:04:53.552
What happened with
Keith, is he okay?

01:04:53.554 --> 01:04:56.021
He's fine. Come on, I've got
some questions for you.

01:04:56.023 --> 01:04:57.222
Oh, why, what did he say?

01:04:57.224 --> 01:05:01.260
Oh, Jesus.

01:05:06.068 --> 01:05:06.967
Fuck my life.

01:05:14.675 --> 01:05:16.411
"Do not engage,"
my fucking arse.

01:05:36.197 --> 01:05:38.097
What the, no, no.

01:05:38.099 --> 01:05:39.331
Get off me.

01:05:39.333 --> 01:05:40.467
Get off me.

01:05:40.469 --> 01:05:41.367
No.

01:05:41.369 --> 01:05:42.672
Rose!

01:05:47.108 --> 01:05:48.076
Stay back.

01:05:49.443 --> 01:05:52.211
Oh my...

01:06:12.733 --> 01:06:15.802
Come on, let's dance.

01:06:15.804 --> 01:06:16.706
Really?

01:06:49.503 --> 01:06:51.072
Oh my God.

01:06:52.173 --> 01:06:53.673
You should go.

01:06:53.675 --> 01:06:55.208
Are you mad?

01:06:55.210 --> 01:06:57.545
You need the hospital,
let me help you.

01:06:59.181 --> 01:07:01.449
Go, now.

01:07:15.831 --> 01:07:18.298
So, where do you and the other

01:07:18.300 --> 01:07:20.300
traitorous wankers
hang out then?

01:07:20.302 --> 01:07:22.302
Suck my...

01:07:27.208 --> 01:07:28.176
Where?

01:07:29.543 --> 01:07:32.213
Got you good eh,
you feeling it yet?

01:07:33.815 --> 01:07:37.117
Killing House outside
of town, north exit.

01:07:37.119 --> 01:07:38.318
We train there.

01:07:38.320 --> 01:07:39.719
You do Dan in there too?

01:07:39.721 --> 01:07:41.621
I just stood guard that night.

01:07:41.623 --> 01:07:42.822
The others, they...

01:07:42.824 --> 01:07:44.324
Sure, you just
guarded the door

01:07:44.326 --> 01:07:46.159
while they murdered my friend.

01:07:46.161 --> 01:07:47.793
That's totally fine obviously.

01:07:47.795 --> 01:07:48.728
No.

01:08:01.809 --> 01:08:02.610
Good.

01:08:06.614 --> 01:08:08.715
Got a location secured.

01:08:08.717 --> 01:08:11.351
We'll be back in business
by tomorrow night.

01:08:11.353 --> 01:08:13.887
Splendid, let Larsson know

01:08:13.889 --> 01:08:15.458
that we're ready to do the deal.

01:08:21.162 --> 01:08:21.796
Sergeant Barnes.

01:08:23.832 --> 01:08:27.567
Let's prepare a suitable
welcoming party for our friend.

01:08:27.569 --> 01:08:28.370
Boss.

01:08:42.184 --> 01:08:43.383
Are you okay?

01:08:43.385 --> 01:08:45.184
Jesus.

01:08:45.185 --> 01:08:46.318
Am I okay?

01:08:46.319 --> 01:08:47.786
Are you okay?

01:08:47.787 --> 01:08:50.557
Look, don't go back
in there for a while.

01:08:50.559 --> 01:08:51.792
Let the police handle...

01:08:54.930 --> 01:08:55.731
Never mind.

01:09:02.502 --> 01:09:04.970
Oi, where have you been?

01:09:04.971 --> 01:09:06.707
Wait, what happened,
are you alright?

01:09:09.377 --> 01:09:10.479
Thank you.

01:09:20.755 --> 01:09:23.225
Not now, seriously.

01:09:25.292 --> 01:09:25.894
Later then.

01:09:29.462 --> 01:09:30.265
What?

01:09:40.975 --> 01:09:43.475
Come on, I'll show you.

01:09:43.478 --> 01:09:45.345
Thanks ever so much for helping.

01:10:05.800 --> 01:10:06.802
That's nice.

01:10:08.369 --> 01:10:08.970
Yeah.

01:10:11.538 --> 01:10:12.938
What's this then?

01:10:12.940 --> 01:10:14.773
We used to wear
them on missions.

01:10:14.775 --> 01:10:16.375
Who's we?

01:10:16.377 --> 01:10:19.344
My old unit,
Dan and the others.

01:10:19.346 --> 01:10:21.382
Oh, well,
where are they now?

01:10:23.318 --> 01:10:23.918
They're gone.

01:10:34.496 --> 01:10:36.297
Those things'll
kill you, you know.

01:10:43.037 --> 01:10:44.603
That looks awful.

01:10:44.605 --> 01:10:46.039
How much blood do
you reckon you lost?

01:10:46.041 --> 01:10:47.710
Probably need to have an
orange juice or something.

01:10:50.979 --> 01:10:53.045
It was crazy back there,
with that guy with the gun.

01:10:53.047 --> 01:10:54.714
What do you think
actually happened?

01:10:54.716 --> 01:10:58.287
I know what you did, Sandra.
I know about Dan.

01:10:59.587 --> 01:11:02.691
No, I didn't.

01:11:05.726 --> 01:11:10.396
Look, I'm really sorry
I helped them, okay.

01:11:10.398 --> 01:11:13.633
I never thought that,
but I can help you now, okay?

01:11:13.635 --> 01:11:15.701
I'll do whatever
you want I swear.

01:11:15.703 --> 01:11:17.803
Sandra, I want
you to know that I

01:11:17.805 --> 01:11:20.639
understand you're
a victim in all this.

01:11:20.641 --> 01:11:22.075
What do you mean?

01:11:22.077 --> 01:11:24.876
You've been a victim
your whole life.

01:11:24.878 --> 01:11:28.848
Of this place,
Keith, Hatcher too.

01:11:28.850 --> 01:11:31.720
I just wanted you to know
that I understand that.

01:11:34.021 --> 01:11:37.055
I am so sorry that I
told them where you were,

01:11:37.057 --> 01:11:40.793
and I am so, so sorry that
I told them about Dan.

01:11:40.795 --> 01:11:43.028
I never ever...

01:11:43.030 --> 01:11:46.766
It's just,
it's the stuff, you know.

01:11:46.768 --> 01:11:52.037
I need it and I can't,

01:11:52.039 --> 01:11:53.740
but I'm gonna quit, okay.

01:11:53.742 --> 01:11:55.607
I'm gonna quit,
and I'm gonna help you

01:11:55.609 --> 01:11:58.846
if you just let me help you
I promise I swear I'll quit.

01:12:25.707 --> 01:12:26.542
Let him come.

01:12:52.167 --> 01:12:53.799
Hello sunshine.

01:12:53.801 --> 01:12:56.501
Gold, so you're
still coming then?

01:12:56.503 --> 01:12:57.937
Looks like it.

01:12:57.939 --> 01:13:00.440
You do realize you're
on a suicide run?

01:13:00.442 --> 01:13:05.945
Actually in 10, maybe 12
minutes, you'll all be dead.

01:13:05.947 --> 01:13:07.179
You're in no position to...

01:13:07.181 --> 01:13:09.417
Gold?

01:13:35.542 --> 01:13:36.644
Right then.

01:14:00.635 --> 01:14:02.171
The boys are ready.

01:14:04.072 --> 01:14:05.838
Excellent.

01:14:05.840 --> 01:14:11.076
We'll let Gold come to
us, end his interference,

01:14:11.078 --> 01:14:12.780
and then it's back to business.

01:14:20.688 --> 01:14:22.254
What's this prick
look like then?

01:14:22.256 --> 01:14:24.156
Ah who gives a shit,

01:14:24.158 --> 01:14:25.558
just shoot any prick
you don't recognize

01:14:25.560 --> 01:14:27.259
so we can piss off down the pub.

01:14:30.564 --> 01:14:32.697
First round's on me lads.

01:15:27.322 --> 01:15:29.088
Come on, let's go.

01:16:18.706 --> 01:16:20.609
Come on, what're
you waiting for?

01:16:22.275 --> 01:16:23.979
It's a fucking party.

01:16:44.399 --> 01:16:46.201
You know, Hatcher
might be top dog,

01:16:47.969 --> 01:16:50.972
but I'm the main event.

01:16:53.041 --> 01:16:54.773
Yeah you're really
tough and scary.

01:16:54.775 --> 01:16:56.308
Yeah?

01:16:56.310 --> 01:16:58.647
And you're about as hard
as a baby's first shite.

01:17:15.430 --> 01:17:16.231
Ooh.

01:17:18.298 --> 01:17:19.100
He's a bleeder.

01:17:53.234 --> 01:17:55.201
We haven't even been introduced.

01:18:07.914 --> 01:18:08.947
Feel me now?

01:18:15.256 --> 01:18:16.488
You know, I've been
looking forward

01:18:16.490 --> 01:18:18.260
to this ever since
outside the pub.

01:18:23.797 --> 01:18:27.098
Welcome to Glasgow.

01:18:28.168 --> 01:18:29.235
Do you know the real highlight

01:18:29.237 --> 01:18:31.269
for me over the past few days

01:18:31.271 --> 01:18:33.272
was putting those
perfectly round

01:18:33.274 --> 01:18:37.242
bullet holes into
poor old Ettie Mason.

01:18:37.244 --> 01:18:43.249
That, for me chum,
was a real treat.

01:18:56.029 --> 01:18:57.932
This one's for Ettie.

01:19:02.502 --> 01:19:03.968
Right then.

01:19:43.043 --> 01:19:44.343
I think it's time for you

01:19:44.345 --> 01:19:45.910
to bring Gold to
me, Sergeant Barnes.

01:19:45.912 --> 01:19:47.545
Boss, are you sure you...

01:19:47.547 --> 01:19:50.217
Bring him to me now,
that's a direct order.

01:20:11.404 --> 01:20:13.841
Look, Gold is it?

01:20:23.885 --> 01:20:25.554
Hatcher wants to
face you one on one.

01:20:27.421 --> 01:20:30.121
Me, I've seen what you can do

01:20:30.123 --> 01:20:32.059
and I'm not crazy
enough to take you on.

01:20:39.634 --> 01:20:40.435
Gold?

01:20:49.143 --> 01:20:52.279
I'll quit all of this right now.

01:20:56.016 --> 01:20:57.519
Just let me walk out of here.

01:21:03.123 --> 01:21:04.592
I just wanna go.

01:21:08.561 --> 01:21:10.028
Deal, or...

01:21:10.030 --> 01:21:11.498
No deal.

01:21:31.452 --> 01:21:32.487
Do come in.

01:21:40.461 --> 01:21:41.630
You've impressed me, Gold.

01:21:43.296 --> 01:21:44.729
I could use a man like you.

01:21:44.731 --> 01:21:45.934
Not interested.

01:21:55.475 --> 01:21:57.276
On with it then.

01:22:19.500 --> 01:22:21.099
I don't get it.

01:22:21.101 --> 01:22:23.505
All this aggravation
for what, the Masons?

01:22:29.143 --> 01:22:30.545
Not just the Masons.

01:22:32.345 --> 01:22:36.714
Brotherhood, loyalty,
queen and country.

01:22:45.192 --> 01:22:45.993
Brotherhood?

01:22:47.094 --> 01:22:48.128
The money from this?

01:22:49.764 --> 01:22:52.296
It's going to the families
of men we've lost.

01:22:52.298 --> 01:22:54.400
Families the
government left to rot.

01:22:54.402 --> 01:22:58.637
We saw an opportunity to make
it right, and we took it.

01:22:58.639 --> 01:23:01.009
And you killed innocent
people in the process.

01:23:02.643 --> 01:23:03.444
Good people.

01:23:08.815 --> 01:23:10.585
They didn't deserve any of this.

01:23:47.520 --> 01:23:48.655
Any last words?

01:24:04.704 --> 01:24:06.373
You should have
taken my offer.

01:25:05.565 --> 01:25:06.800
You're welcome.

01:25:09.170 --> 01:25:11.503
I had him right
where I wanted him.

01:25:11.505 --> 01:25:14.205
Where is he,
oh, is he in here?

01:25:14.207 --> 01:25:15.473
Oh no.

01:25:15.475 --> 01:25:17.776
Oh my God,
what happened to you?

01:25:17.778 --> 01:25:19.577
Did you kill all
of those people?

01:25:19.579 --> 01:25:21.381
How did you kill them?

01:25:23.551 --> 01:25:25.584
Is that, is that your blood?

01:25:25.586 --> 01:25:28.553
You know, I really think you might
need a plaster or something.

01:25:28.555 --> 01:25:29.356
Thanks.

01:25:31.859 --> 01:25:32.794
I'll see you soon.

01:25:34.194 --> 01:25:34.795
You better not.

01:25:38.765 --> 01:25:41.833
All units, stand down,
regroup at point C.

01:25:41.835 --> 01:25:44.471
Seriously though, who is
that guy, and where's he going?

01:25:46.207 --> 01:25:48.540
Right, anyway, are you
sure you're alright?

01:25:48.542 --> 01:25:50.308
- Fighting fit.
- Oh, great.

01:25:50.310 --> 01:25:53.678
Well in that case, please
can I hold one of your guns?

01:25:53.680 --> 01:25:55.682
Oh come on, just a small one.

01:25:58.484 --> 01:26:00.419
We are gathered to commemorate

01:26:00.421 --> 01:26:07.425
the life and passing of Dan
Mason, may he rest in peace.

01:26:07.427 --> 01:26:10.228
Let us remember all
those who have died

01:26:10.230 --> 01:26:14.232
for their country,
in war and peace.

01:26:14.234 --> 01:26:18.639
Those whom we knew, and those
whose memory we treasure.

01:26:24.411 --> 01:26:25.346
Good journey, Dan.

01:26:31.452 --> 01:26:32.353
Gold.

01:26:33.886 --> 01:26:35.486
Frost.

01:26:35.488 --> 01:26:37.623
We were wondering what
you were doing up here.

01:26:37.625 --> 01:26:39.258
You always did have
a habit of going

01:26:39.260 --> 01:26:41.593
all Charles Bronson
at times, didn't you?

01:26:41.595 --> 01:26:43.428
You come to take me in?

01:26:43.430 --> 01:26:44.996
Your team's as subtle as ever.

01:26:44.998 --> 01:26:46.531
Far from it.

01:26:46.533 --> 01:26:49.701
All call signs,
this is Zero, stand down.

01:26:49.703 --> 01:26:51.272
Walk with me, John.

01:26:54.574 --> 01:26:58.677
Look, off the record,
what you've accomplished here

01:26:58.679 --> 01:27:01.713
in a couple of days is more than the
department could have done in months.

01:27:01.715 --> 01:27:03.682
What about the families
of Hatcher's men?

01:27:03.684 --> 01:27:05.851
Intel gleaned from
Hatcher's computer shows funds

01:27:05.853 --> 01:27:07.952
transferred to a dozen
different accounts,

01:27:07.954 --> 01:27:10.358
but honestly I
came here for you.

01:27:13.493 --> 01:27:18.664
John, I know this has probably
been difficult for you,

01:27:18.666 --> 01:27:20.065
but you were always
our best field asset

01:27:20.067 --> 01:27:22.034
and we need you back on the job.

01:27:22.036 --> 01:27:22.971
I'll tell you what.

01:27:24.904 --> 01:27:27.906
Take some time,
sort your head out.

01:27:27.908 --> 01:27:29.310
Go somewhere, tropical.

01:27:31.511 --> 01:27:34.581
Then come back to us, and
we can crack on with work.

01:27:38.484 --> 01:27:39.286
Well?

01:27:43.623 --> 01:27:44.990
Gold?

01:27:59.006 --> 01:27:59.807
Hello?

01:28:12.853 --> 01:28:14.055
What's going on?

01:28:18.391 --> 01:28:18.992
Whoa.

01:28:28.435 --> 01:28:31.436
Is it from him?
What does it say?

01:28:31.438 --> 01:28:34.042
It says, "Shut up
and do your homework, Violet."

01:28:52.893 --> 01:28:54.425
You okay?

01:28:54.427 --> 01:28:56.596
Every day is perfection, you?

01:28:58.465 --> 01:29:01.967
Well, it's been
a little bit stressful.

01:29:01.969 --> 01:29:03.735
- You ready?
- Can I drive?

01:29:03.737 --> 01:29:04.538
Nope.

01:29:12.645 --> 01:29:14.478
Where are we going?

01:29:14.480 --> 01:29:15.847
I told you, London.

01:29:15.849 --> 01:29:17.616
Well what part?

01:29:17.618 --> 01:29:19.651
A nice part.

01:29:19.653 --> 01:29:21.620
Oh, that's nice.

01:29:21.622 --> 01:29:23.487
What kind of music have you got?

01:29:23.489 --> 01:29:25.190
No music.

01:29:25.192 --> 01:29:26.424
No music?

01:29:26.426 --> 01:29:28.125
That's so boring.

01:29:28.127 --> 01:29:29.928
Ooh, what about my music?

01:29:29.930 --> 01:29:34.566
We can play my music on my
phone, hang on one sec, oi.
