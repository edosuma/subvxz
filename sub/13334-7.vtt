WEBVTT

00:01.334 --> 00:01.534
.

00:07.273 --> 00:09.809
The Geordies are back in the Toon,
wicked!

00:11.010 --> 00:13.780
We are doing what we do best.
Fuck me!

00:13.847 --> 00:14.914
Partying.

00:16.416 --> 00:17.851
Tashing on.

00:17.917 --> 00:19.419
Getting mortal.

00:19.486 --> 00:20.587
Shagging.

00:21.921 --> 00:23.423
It's insane!

00:24.958 --> 00:26.793
(screams)

00:29.996 --> 00:31.631
Shit's about to get real.

00:33.566 --> 00:37.036
Kyle's come in and now I'm
a slut again. Fucking mint.

00:37.103 --> 00:40.907
If Kyle thinks he can pull girls
then come back and pull me,

00:40.974 --> 00:44.377
he's got another thing coming.
It's really fucking frustrating

00:44.444 --> 00:46.546
that me and Marnie like each other.

00:47.046 --> 00:49.215
But she knows why I won't go there.

00:49.282 --> 00:52.218
Tash on Tours,
we're taking it international.

00:52.285 --> 00:53.820
Iceland, here we fucking go.

00:53.887 --> 00:56.689
There's girls on this arm, that arm.
Come on!

00:56.756 --> 01:00.760
I'll never pull Aaron with these
girls throwing themselves at him.

01:00.827 --> 01:04.263
I am pissed off at the boys,
they brought 50 million girls here.

01:04.330 --> 01:07.801
We're meant to be a family.
I fucking hate Iceland.

01:09.536 --> 01:11.704
I should have a degree
in pulling women.

01:11.771 --> 01:14.007
I am a Geordie girl with a VIP edge.

01:14.073 --> 01:16.743
I'm a natural beauty.
Real boobs, real hair.

01:16.810 --> 01:18.645
I'm gonna tear the place up.

01:18.711 --> 01:21.181
I've never kissed anyone
without a six pack.

01:21.247 --> 01:23.450
Hardest graft I've ever done
is me hair.

01:23.516 --> 01:25.785
Cheeky, colourful
and full of mischief.

01:25.852 --> 01:27.687
I'm fake, flirty
and I've got FFs.

01:27.754 --> 01:29.489
I'm gonna make sparks fly.

01:29.556 --> 01:31.591
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

01:43.069 --> 01:45.538
It was a shit night.

01:45.605 --> 01:48.141
I've woken up this morning,
I'm so hung over,

01:48.208 --> 01:50.877
and I'm even more angry
than last night,

01:50.944 --> 01:52.612
this is not gonna be a good day.

01:52.679 --> 01:55.882
I couldn't even speak to the lads,
I thought I was literally

01:55.949 --> 01:58.284
not wanted,
it was their side and our side.

01:58.351 --> 01:59.919
We couldn't even dance.

01:59.986 --> 02:04.023
There was no room cos of the lads
brought about 27 girls in.

02:04.090 --> 02:05.959
This was meant to be a family trip,

02:06.025 --> 02:09.329
but whenever there's fanny around,
the family goes to pot.

02:09.395 --> 02:12.265
"Family" definitely
comes before "fanny".

02:12.332 --> 02:14.534
We haven't got long left of
this trip now,

02:14.601 --> 02:16.369
and I don't give a fuck about them.

02:27.914 --> 02:29.616
We're cooking breakfast,

02:29.682 --> 02:33.052
and they're all starting to feel bad
for ignoring the girls.

02:38.591 --> 02:41.828
The best thing to do is send
Tweedledum and Tweedletee

02:41.895 --> 02:43.496
upstairs to patch shit up.

02:45.965 --> 02:47.734
All right, girls?

02:47.800 --> 02:50.637
We're gonna take you out
for a make-up brunch

02:50.703 --> 02:53.907
because we felt that last night
was a bit of... we were...

02:55.708 --> 02:58.978
The boys have sent James and Scott
to come and apologise,

02:59.045 --> 03:02.048
James didn't do anything wrong
and Scott's a man-baby

03:02.115 --> 03:05.652
who you can't get angry at anyway.
We just got a bit carried away.

03:05.718 --> 03:08.621
Cos it looks like it's dead
and then there's girls...

03:08.688 --> 03:09.989
Let's just go to brunch.

03:10.056 --> 03:12.158
Just stop grovelling,
shut the fuck up

03:12.225 --> 03:14.494
and buy us a bloody fry up.

03:20.199 --> 03:22.302
Oh, my God, pancakes.

03:22.368 --> 03:24.304
The boys are taking us for food,

03:24.370 --> 03:27.840
it's the least they can do after
the way they went on last night.

03:27.907 --> 03:31.210
Basically, girls, we just want
to bring youse here for brunch

03:31.277 --> 03:35.281
just to say sorry and just generally
not paying youse enough attention.

03:35.348 --> 03:36.549
Thanks, Kyle.

03:36.616 --> 03:40.119
If youse want to prove you're sorry,
tonight's the night,

03:40.186 --> 03:43.089
let's see some change
in your behaviour.

03:43.156 --> 03:45.091
I appreciate the boys apologising,

03:45.158 --> 03:49.929
but it's gonna take more than a posh
lunch in Reykjavik to make it up.

03:49.996 --> 03:53.066
We'll have a better night tonight.
It's our last night,

03:53.132 --> 03:56.502
so at least we don't have work as
well and we can do whatever.

03:56.569 --> 03:59.205
That's everything sorted,

03:59.272 --> 04:02.375
so now hopefully we can enjoy
the rest of our day in Iceland.

04:07.313 --> 04:11.951
We're going to the hot springs,
and I can't wait.

04:15.888 --> 04:18.091
I've always wanted to go
to hot springs,

04:18.156 --> 04:19.692
it's like a mini paradise.

04:19.759 --> 04:23.363
With Aaron there it's gonna be
so romantic, it's gonna be mint.

04:23.429 --> 04:24.464
What the fuck?

04:27.433 --> 04:29.369
(Aaron) Is that it?

04:29.435 --> 04:31.037
Eh?
What the fuck?

04:31.104 --> 04:32.672
(laughter)

04:34.474 --> 04:39.078
What the fuck is this?
Where's the lagoon? This is shit.

04:39.145 --> 04:41.114
Oh, it's warm, like.

04:42.482 --> 04:44.517
Is that it?
It's lukewarm.

04:44.584 --> 04:47.220
It's not the romantic backdrop
I was hoping for.

04:47.286 --> 04:49.188
I can't make a move now,

04:49.255 --> 04:51.524
even I can't look sexy
in a pond in the floor.

04:59.332 --> 05:01.100
I'm scared.

05:01.167 --> 05:03.069
Oh, you can sit down.
Can ya?

05:03.136 --> 05:04.404
Aye.

05:04.470 --> 05:06.139
Hey, you can, aye.
(laughs)

05:06.205 --> 05:08.408
This is meant to be
a naked hot spring,

05:08.474 --> 05:11.744
and I'm not being funny,
but I would rather jump in and drown

05:11.811 --> 05:13.713
than get naked in front of these.

05:18.484 --> 05:19.852
Very awkward.

05:22.355 --> 05:24.824
As much as we would like to,
we can't.

05:24.891 --> 05:28.294
We can't do it.
If you wanna neck on with someone,

05:28.361 --> 05:30.563
doesn't mean
you're in a relationship.

05:30.630 --> 05:31.931
Is Holly thick?

05:31.998 --> 05:34.734
Gaz has been shagging Marnie
and he's me best mate

05:34.801 --> 05:38.304
which means I can't go there because
of lad code, what's not to get?

05:41.441 --> 05:44.043
If I was Gary, I'd be like,
"No, fucking go ahead."

05:49.549 --> 05:53.386
I know Aaron's got too much loyalty
to do anything with me cos of Gary,

05:53.453 --> 05:56.189
but Gary would do it
in a heartbeat.

05:56.255 --> 05:59.926
So, what's the difference between
when Marnie was getting with Scott

05:59.992 --> 06:01.861
and then Gary got with Marnie?

06:01.928 --> 06:04.330
Because that was over
a period of time.

06:04.397 --> 06:08.868
That's Gary. Gary is Gary. I'm me,
I'm just a different person to Gary.

06:08.935 --> 06:12.839
I feel so bad for Aaron because he's
trying to be so nice and respectful,

06:12.905 --> 06:14.841
but he just needs to grow a pair

06:14.907 --> 06:17.410
because Gary would never
do the same for him.

06:23.349 --> 06:26.252
While those losers are
at the hot springs,

06:26.319 --> 06:29.789
the rest of us are gonna burn rubber
on the snowmobiles. Winning!

06:29.856 --> 06:31.591
(Gary) Oh, my God!

06:34.293 --> 06:36.429
I can't wait to jump on
the snowmobile,

06:36.496 --> 06:37.964
I'm like a kid at Christmas.

06:43.136 --> 06:46.005
(screams)

06:46.072 --> 06:49.142
At this moment in time,
I have not got a care in the world.

06:49.208 --> 06:53.646
All I can see is snow and mountains,
and we are having the best time ever.

06:54.680 --> 06:56.482
Yeah, yeah!

06:58.684 --> 07:03.289
This is insane, me and Vicky are
going so fast, we took James over.

07:03.356 --> 07:05.158
Eat my snow, James!

07:09.495 --> 07:11.564
I pure love snowmobiling, me, like.

07:11.631 --> 07:14.967
I'm gonna buy one of these and
fucking hoy it around me freezer.

07:18.437 --> 07:21.574
That was probablys the best ride
Vicky's had in a while.

07:21.641 --> 07:23.309
Woo-hoo!

07:26.312 --> 07:30.183
We finish at the hot springs, the
others have finished snowmobiling,

07:30.249 --> 07:33.452
so now it's time to see
what else Iceland has to offer.

07:36.722 --> 07:38.357
It smells like egg!

07:38.424 --> 07:41.928
We get to the place where
we're meeting these geysers.

07:41.994 --> 07:45.131
And it turns out that
they're not men from London.

07:45.198 --> 07:49.335
It's actually water squirting up
from the ground with so much power,

07:49.402 --> 07:51.404
like a giant whale orgasm.

07:53.239 --> 07:56.042
(Kyle) Fucking hell!
(screaming)

07:56.108 --> 07:58.377
These geysers are so amazing,

07:58.444 --> 08:01.581
it's like all the Viking men
cumming at once.

08:01.647 --> 08:04.183
(Charlotte)
It looks like a vagina hole.

08:05.785 --> 08:09.288
All this water brewing out the
ground has made us really hungry,

08:09.355 --> 08:12.859
and luckily the tour man has
laid on a picnic for us, yes!

08:12.925 --> 08:17.930
I'm so excited. Sandwiches, sausage
rolls, cheese, scones... Oh, God.

08:20.867 --> 08:23.336
Oh, my God,
the shops must have been shut,

08:23.402 --> 08:26.973
all this man has managed to
find is sheep's head,

08:27.039 --> 08:30.476
rotten shark
and long pieces of fish.

08:30.543 --> 08:33.078
It all smells like a nana's fanny.

08:33.145 --> 08:36.282
Apparently this is
all traditional Icelandic food,

08:36.349 --> 08:39.217
but it looks like the shit
a butcher would throw out.

08:39.284 --> 08:43.422
No chance I'm eating that.
It all fucking stinks!

08:43.489 --> 08:45.524
(screaming)

08:46.759 --> 08:49.362
I like sheep.
(gags)

08:49.428 --> 08:53.165
This rotten shark knocked me sick,
smells like a fucking sweaty...

08:53.232 --> 08:56.202
(gags) Smells like a sweaty fanny.
(coughs)

08:56.269 --> 08:59.005
(laughter)

08:59.071 --> 09:01.007
(Vicky) Go on, Aaron lad.
(coughs)

09:01.073 --> 09:04.277
Oh, wow. (coughs)
I feel sick.

09:04.343 --> 09:07.079
I can do it, I can do it,
I can do it!

09:10.116 --> 09:13.386
Go on, Kyle!
(screaming)

09:15.254 --> 09:19.959
(gags) I'm gonna be sick.
(gags)

09:23.229 --> 09:24.597
Today has been unreal,

09:24.664 --> 09:27.466
now we're heading back
and then we're back on it.

09:32.271 --> 09:36.075
Everyone's getting ready, hopefully
we can put last night behind wuh.

09:48.988 --> 09:53.359
If one lad is banging a girl, you do
not go and bang them straight after.

10:00.733 --> 10:03.469
Because Gary waited
before getting with Marnie,

10:03.536 --> 10:07.440
Scott respects him for it,
which means I'm gonna do the same.

10:21.921 --> 10:24.323
They could actually be a couple,

10:24.390 --> 10:27.460
but it's getting stopped by Gary
cos he's a skinny prick

10:27.526 --> 10:29.495
and he wants all the attention.

10:34.467 --> 10:37.770
(gasps) Oh, my God, what the fuck?

10:37.837 --> 10:39.972
I'll take Aaron to
the Northern Lights,

10:40.039 --> 10:42.341
cos we need a chance
to speak on wuh own,

10:42.408 --> 10:46.412
I need to see how he feels, and if
he does wanna leave it, so be it.

10:50.349 --> 10:51.784
That's an amazing idea.

10:51.851 --> 10:55.187
This is a first,
Marnie's had a good idea.

10:55.254 --> 10:58.157
Don't get us wrong,
it's probablys gonna go tits up,

10:58.224 --> 10:59.892
but I wish her the best of luck.

11:01.627 --> 11:04.163
Penis alert, penis alert!

11:06.465 --> 11:08.567
I'm sick of Gary
going on about lad code,

11:08.634 --> 11:12.171
he didn't wait as long as everyone
thinks before he got with me.

11:12.238 --> 11:15.341
I could be in bed with Marnie,
but no, I'm in bed with James.

11:15.408 --> 11:17.610
I hope Gaz realises what
a good friend I am.

11:17.676 --> 11:20.312
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

11:22.214 --> 11:22.415
.

11:25.051 --> 11:25.251
.

11:32.558 --> 11:34.560
(whooping)

11:35.828 --> 11:39.432
So, we're about to hit the club,
round two in Reykjavik, bring it on.

11:54.680 --> 11:58.884
This is our last night in Iceland
and everyone's having a good time.

11:58.951 --> 12:00.486
I pure love Iceland, me.

12:07.193 --> 12:08.394
Go on, go on.

12:10.496 --> 12:12.364
People dance weird in Iceland,

12:12.431 --> 12:16.168
this boy's dancing and he looks like
he's having air sex.

12:18.270 --> 12:21.707
We're in the club and Kyle is
all over me. What the fuck?

12:21.774 --> 12:23.476
Oh, my God, stop it.

12:31.150 --> 12:32.585
Holly's looking wicked,

12:32.651 --> 12:36.555
so I'm gonna let the lads do their
thing, and put a shift in with her.

12:40.793 --> 12:42.828
I've got real feelings for Aaron,

12:42.895 --> 12:45.731
but I need to get him on his own
to tell him how I feel.

12:57.910 --> 13:01.714
Marnie wants to talk. How do you say
no to a pretty face like that?

13:06.285 --> 13:09.655
I hope when me and Aaron
are on our own,

13:09.722 --> 13:13.025
we can open up to each other,
we might even get wuh first kiss.

13:23.402 --> 13:26.705
Holly's new sassy persona
is fooling absolutely no-one,

13:26.772 --> 13:29.408
we all know she's gonna end up
sucking Kyle off,

13:29.475 --> 13:31.911
falling in love
and having her heart broken.

13:39.985 --> 13:44.423
Me and Vicky hope Holly doesn't get
hurt and Kyle actually likes Holly.

13:44.490 --> 13:47.026
Let me tell you, if he doesn't,

13:47.092 --> 13:50.062
I will Sellotape his dick
to his stomach

13:50.129 --> 13:53.966
so that every time he pisses,
he wees all over his self.

13:54.033 --> 13:57.636
Yeah, who's laughing now, Kyle?!
Piss face!

14:07.079 --> 14:09.014
So Marnie set a honey trap for Aaron

14:09.081 --> 14:11.717
and she's gonna take him
to the Northern Lights

14:11.784 --> 14:15.054
where she's probablys
gonna present her vagina to him.

14:19.959 --> 14:23.429
Aaron's getting dragged out
by Marnie, what's happened?

14:23.495 --> 14:27.466
If I can get Aaron away from Gary,
I can find out exactly how he feels,

14:27.533 --> 14:30.169
and if he feels the same way
about me as I do him.

14:46.785 --> 14:50.155
I know the things to say to
make sure Holly's putty in me hands.

14:55.561 --> 14:59.531
I've had a really good night, me
and Kyle have been flirting so much,

14:59.598 --> 15:01.800
and I can't believe
I'm about to say this,

15:01.867 --> 15:03.969
but I think I actually fancy Kyle.

15:05.971 --> 15:07.106
Fuck them!

15:07.172 --> 15:10.743
This has been a perfect night,
the couples are off being couply,

15:10.809 --> 15:14.413
the singles are off being singly,
and Gary and Scott have pulled.

15:14.480 --> 15:17.983
Order is restored in
the Geordie Shore family.

15:28.227 --> 15:30.296
I'm excited for the Northern Lights,

15:30.362 --> 15:32.598
it's something
I've always wanted to do,

15:32.665 --> 15:35.801
and it's gonna be even better
that it's just me and Aaron.

15:42.675 --> 15:47.613
This is just a plan to get me in
the middle of nowhere by meself.

15:47.680 --> 15:51.050
I met girls like you before,
not having your wicked way with me.

15:56.755 --> 15:58.324
(both laugh)

15:58.390 --> 16:02.594
Aaron's being so sweet and he looks
so cute in his little hat.

16:12.371 --> 16:15.908
I do really like Marnie, and it's
shit we can't get together now,

16:15.974 --> 16:18.010
but maybe we can be together
in future.

16:23.115 --> 16:26.585
Aaron's telling us he wants
something to happen in the future,

16:26.652 --> 16:28.320
that'll have to be good enough.

16:28.387 --> 16:31.523
Even though we haven't seen
any lights,

16:31.590 --> 16:33.926
it's been nice
spending time with Marnie.

16:39.264 --> 16:42.434
I hope Gaz realises what
a fucking good friend I am.

16:47.406 --> 16:50.642
(Vicky) Come on, guys, get out!
(Charlotte) Come on! Lads!

16:50.709 --> 16:51.944
It's home time!

16:57.750 --> 17:01.720
We get back to the apartment,
me and Kyle are getting flirty,

17:01.787 --> 17:05.691
and I might stay in his bed, but
I'm definitely not gonna shag him.

17:08.193 --> 17:11.296
We're in bed and our hands
are wandering a little bit,

17:11.363 --> 17:14.767
and I'm fully clothed, but Kyle
seems to be a little bit naked.

17:14.833 --> 17:16.201
I'm not shagging ya!

17:20.606 --> 17:22.574
We're not gonna ruin it, are we?

17:30.115 --> 17:31.717
Oh!

17:38.390 --> 17:42.194
I've had a mint night, but I need
to take myself away from temptation.

17:43.228 --> 17:47.132
I could be in bed with Marnie...
but no, I'm in bed with James.

17:52.070 --> 17:53.906
Here, this bird's pure naughty,

17:53.972 --> 17:56.608
I might even take her
back to the Toon with us.

17:58.710 --> 18:00.312
Woo.

18:22.734 --> 18:26.738
Even though me and Aaron have agreed
to wait, last night was so romantic,

18:26.805 --> 18:29.808
but nothing's ever simple
in the Geordie Shore house,

18:29.875 --> 18:32.744
it's always complicated,
and it never goes your way.

18:37.316 --> 18:39.885
Typical Gary,
wanting to be the puppet master

18:39.952 --> 18:43.422
controlling all situations
and controlling all people.

18:43.489 --> 18:46.258
"Hi, my name's Aaron
and I'm a puppet,

18:46.325 --> 18:49.962
what would you like me to do now,
Gary? Suck you off? OK."

18:52.164 --> 18:55.667
I've woken up this morning
and I look next to me,

18:55.734 --> 18:58.070
and oh, my God,
there's a Kyle in my bed.

19:02.908 --> 19:05.644
Penis alert, penis alert,
penis alert!

19:09.281 --> 19:12.718
I'm so glad that there's no
complications between me and Kyle,

19:12.784 --> 19:14.920
we're actually good friends.

19:21.527 --> 19:26.265
Me dick's out for a reason,
I wish it got more than a cuddle.

19:29.535 --> 19:32.704
I need to clear me head,
so I'm gonna go for a walk,

19:32.771 --> 19:35.107
and the best person
to come with us is James

19:35.173 --> 19:37.809
because he's the only lad
who isn't up Gary's arse.

19:37.876 --> 19:42.014
This is really frustrating because
me and Aaron like each other.

19:42.080 --> 19:44.650
He likes ya
and it's obvious you like him,

19:44.716 --> 19:48.854
but the only fact that it's not
happening is because Gary.

19:48.921 --> 19:50.589
Yeah.
Which is a shame in a way.

19:50.656 --> 19:53.492
It's so frustrating
how Gary has all the power,

19:53.559 --> 19:57.429
he controls everyone in the house
when he treats everyone like shit.

19:57.496 --> 20:00.999
I don't think he likes being done
at his own game really.

20:01.066 --> 20:04.002
Wasn't that last time
when me and Scott had feelings,

20:04.069 --> 20:08.807
Gary was constantly trying it on
saying things.

20:08.874 --> 20:11.743
One rule for his self
and one for everyone else.

20:11.810 --> 20:14.212
I'm sick of Gary banging on
about lad code.

20:14.279 --> 20:16.214
He's the one who doesn't follow it.

20:16.281 --> 20:19.651
He didn't wait as long as everyone
thinks before he got with me.

20:19.718 --> 20:25.090
He said that he waited ages to get
with you after Scott had been there.

20:25.157 --> 20:27.225
Yeah, really ages(!)

20:27.292 --> 20:30.729
Marnie's telling us that Gaz
didn't wait anywhere near as long

20:30.796 --> 20:33.665
as he's told everyone
before sleeping with Marnie.

20:33.732 --> 20:35.867
Scotty T's not gonna be happy.

20:37.169 --> 20:40.405
I can hear Holly's throbbing vagina
coming up the stairs

20:40.472 --> 20:43.909
while me and Vicky are packing,
and this only means one thing,

20:43.976 --> 20:46.545
something's definitely happened
with Kyle.

20:46.612 --> 20:49.648
Morning. Here she is.

20:49.715 --> 20:53.185
What's going on?
Dirty little stop-out.

20:53.251 --> 20:55.887
Did you have a nice "sleep"
last night?

20:57.656 --> 20:59.925
Did you "sleep" like a baby?

20:59.992 --> 21:01.927
I did actually sleep like a baby.

21:01.994 --> 21:03.829
We ask Holly what's happened,

21:03.895 --> 21:06.665
and she gets this creepy smile
on her face,

21:06.732 --> 21:09.935
what the hell's going on with her?
Is she in love?

21:12.704 --> 21:14.006
I love this "and that".

21:14.072 --> 21:16.942
No but obviously there was
a little bit of touching,

21:17.009 --> 21:19.678
but, like, nothing, like...
Well, that's good.

21:19.745 --> 21:21.046
He was mortal.

21:21.113 --> 21:24.883
He's probably one of the best person
I've slept with cuddle-wise.

21:24.950 --> 21:27.919
Such a great cuddler,
and, like, it was just nice.

21:27.986 --> 21:30.622
I want to be scornful,
I want to grief her,

21:30.689 --> 21:33.492
but the fact of the matter is,
I'm a little bit proud.

21:35.327 --> 21:37.496
I love you.
I'm so grown up now.

21:40.465 --> 21:43.135
Iceland can shove its ice
up its fucking arse.

21:43.201 --> 21:45.437
I've sat in a puddle,
been cock-blocked

21:45.504 --> 21:48.006
and looked at a black sky,
get me to the Toon.

22:01.753 --> 22:05.090
He's taking the piss
saying I'm getting cock-blocked.

22:05.157 --> 22:06.925
Aye, mate, by fucking you.

22:10.162 --> 22:12.397
I do know it's hard
cos he fancies Marnie,

22:12.464 --> 22:14.966
but he doesn't wanna go there
cos he's my friend

22:15.033 --> 22:17.669
and I was shagging her first,
but that's lad code.

22:21.273 --> 22:24.309
Iceland's been absolutely mint,
I've seen geysers,

22:24.376 --> 22:27.279
blared round on a snowmobile,
ate a sheep's head,

22:27.345 --> 22:30.315
it's been fucking epic,
but now it's time to gan yam.

22:35.187 --> 22:39.024
Marnie's telling me that Gary
has broke his own lad code.

22:42.761 --> 22:44.529
I'm not keeping me mouth shut.

22:44.596 --> 22:48.300
Let's put another spanner
in the works, Vicky, come here.

22:48.366 --> 22:52.804
Why am I kissing Gary?!
Eurgh! Eurgh! Stop it!

22:52.871 --> 22:55.507
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

22:57.409 --> 22:57.609
.

23:00.245 --> 23:00.445
.

23:13.692 --> 23:15.527
It's so cold in this house.

23:15.594 --> 23:17.863
It's too cold,
it's colder than Iceland.

23:17.929 --> 23:20.365
Let's get breakfast.
Yeah, I'm starving.

23:22.768 --> 23:24.903
I'm so pleased
to be back in Newcastle,

23:24.970 --> 23:27.506
I can't wait to have
some normal Geordie food,

23:27.572 --> 23:31.109
so I'm going for a fry up.
Vicks, you wanna come for breakfast?

23:32.444 --> 23:35.046
(laughter)

23:35.113 --> 23:37.849
I just wanna sleep,
but they wanna go for breakfast

23:37.916 --> 23:40.018
and I can't let them go on their own

23:40.085 --> 23:43.121
cos they'll probably get lost
without my supervision.

23:43.989 --> 23:49.361
Morning. Do youse wanna come
for breakfast with us girls?

23:49.427 --> 23:52.697
I don't think we're gonna come,
we need to go to the gym.

23:52.764 --> 23:55.600
The girls wanna go for a fry-up,
but fuck that,

23:55.667 --> 23:58.103
we've let training slip
being in Iceland.

24:08.213 --> 24:10.582
I've organised a massive
assault course.

24:10.649 --> 24:13.018
We're doing a 10K run,
crawling in tunnels,

24:13.084 --> 24:17.088
jumping off obstacles, we need to
be hitting the gym, not the cafe.

24:21.693 --> 24:23.695
Vicky is still in her fucking duvet,

24:23.762 --> 24:26.164
What the hell?
She looks ridiculous.

24:27.599 --> 24:29.601
(laughter)

24:29.668 --> 24:31.837
Lasses, I said
I'd come for breakfast,,

24:31.903 --> 24:35.607
but I didn't say anything
about getting dressed. Quilt club!

24:40.679 --> 24:42.047
No.

24:43.215 --> 24:44.916
Hiya.

24:44.983 --> 24:47.819
Can I please have
scrambled egg on toast,

24:47.886 --> 24:51.256
three hash browns
and two sausages, please?

24:51.323 --> 24:53.258
Me and Vicky are gonna detox,

24:53.325 --> 24:55.727
whereas Holly and Marnie
get sausages.

24:55.794 --> 24:58.563
Shock, they're getting sausages.
Slags.

25:01.233 --> 25:03.068
(all) Really?

25:10.208 --> 25:14.412
I'm sick of Gary using lad code
to get in between Aaron and Marnie.

25:14.479 --> 25:16.848
If no-one else is gonna talk to him,
I will.

25:25.790 --> 25:28.660
Gary's not as innocent
as he's making out,

25:28.727 --> 25:31.630
he didn't have lad code
when I was getting with Scott.

25:33.798 --> 25:34.799
You what?

25:40.572 --> 25:44.175
This is too awkward, what can I say
without causing loads of trouble?

25:51.783 --> 25:53.451
I'm still pissed from Iceland,

25:53.518 --> 25:56.855
I can't remember the last time
I went to the gym, I'm dreading it.

26:00.191 --> 26:03.929
We get to the gym, this isn't normal,
this looks like military shit.

26:03.995 --> 26:06.598
We are gonna die. Lads, all the best.

26:09.267 --> 26:11.369
Will we be sick?
YOU might be.

26:11.436 --> 26:14.105
(laughter)

26:14.172 --> 26:17.042
This dumbbell wants
to put wuh through our paces,

26:17.108 --> 26:19.311
this is gonna be hard-core.

26:21.079 --> 26:23.882
Three, two, one, go!

26:32.190 --> 26:34.626
Don't get us wrong,
CrossFit is proper nails,

26:34.693 --> 26:39.397
but it's so good to be lifting
weights instead of hoying tequilas.

26:51.443 --> 26:53.078
Fucking hell!

26:55.280 --> 26:56.614
Training's going well,

26:56.681 --> 26:59.517
however Aaron is gone
a different shade of white,

26:59.584 --> 27:03.388
he's sweating, he's hot,
things are not going that kid's way.

27:04.656 --> 27:06.224
Pick it up, buddy, come on!

27:06.291 --> 27:09.594
That's it, I'm out,
I'm gonna be sick.

27:11.830 --> 27:14.366
If we're gonna smash
this fitness challenge,

27:14.432 --> 27:15.967
we need to take it up a notch.

27:16.034 --> 27:18.903
Aaron's got his head down
the toilet being sick.

27:24.642 --> 27:26.678
Me and Kyle are talking in the gym,

27:26.745 --> 27:29.414
and I'm telling him what Marnie
told us in Iceland.

27:38.056 --> 27:39.057
Really?

27:39.124 --> 27:41.326
Fuck me,
James has dropped a bombshell.

27:41.393 --> 27:44.429
When Scotty finds out,
he's gonna be fucking fuming.

27:52.037 --> 27:54.973
All this crack about lad code
bouncing around,

27:55.040 --> 27:57.475
it's a load of shit,
and it's bound to kick off.

28:04.315 --> 28:07.852
Charlotte comes walking down the
stairs with that look on her face

28:07.919 --> 28:10.155
that she's about to do
something stupid.

28:12.390 --> 28:14.125
You wanna be an entrepreneur?

28:14.192 --> 28:18.963
If that fucking slag Anna can make
a load of money off Tash On Tours,

28:19.030 --> 28:22.734
I can make a shit load of money too,
and I've had an idea.

28:22.801 --> 28:27.772
The future is bright,
the future is fairies.

28:37.882 --> 28:41.719
Charlotte has decided
she is the Lord Sugar of vaginas.

28:41.786 --> 28:45.557
She's came up with the idea of
cosmetics for your fairy.

28:45.623 --> 28:48.193
I bet ya Al's
quaking in his fucking boots(!)

28:54.632 --> 28:56.101
You've got Gooch Glitter,

28:56.167 --> 29:00.038
which makes a rainbow leading
right to the brown pot of gold.

29:00.105 --> 29:02.273
This is gonna be amazing!

29:14.886 --> 29:15.887
What?

29:32.370 --> 29:36.174
The world's our fucking oyster,
I think we could be millionaires.

29:38.443 --> 29:41.880
We're going ahead with human
testing. Product? Gooch Glitter.

29:43.248 --> 29:47.619
Can we read the directions? Does it
say not apply to the gooch?

29:47.685 --> 29:50.421
I'm a bit worried though
because I haven't shaved

29:50.488 --> 29:53.625
and sometimes I do have
a little bit of a hairy bum hole.

29:53.691 --> 29:56.060
I'm just gonna do it on
the cheeks a bit.

29:56.127 --> 29:58.796
Is there enough on, Holly?
Yeah, yeah, I think.

29:58.863 --> 30:00.999
OK, go.
Oh, my God.

30:01.065 --> 30:02.467
What?
It looks so pretty.

30:02.534 --> 30:04.602
Ooh, it's tickling.
(laughs)

30:04.669 --> 30:08.773
I think that's enough. Right,
now do I have to stand up and shake?

30:08.840 --> 30:11.576
Yep, or I could blow?
Oh, blowing might be good.

30:14.279 --> 30:15.613
It feels nice.

30:15.680 --> 30:18.016
Bend over a little bit.
That's cool, that.

30:18.082 --> 30:20.385
And it looks even better.

30:20.451 --> 30:23.388
Does it look like
it's gonna lead to the pot of gold?

30:23.454 --> 30:24.455
Yeah.

30:24.522 --> 30:29.227
Charlotte's bum hole looks like a
unicorn has ejaculated all over it.

30:29.294 --> 30:31.696
I'm gonna see if it's,
like, manoeuvrable.

30:31.763 --> 30:33.798
It is comfortable to sit down, like?

30:35.767 --> 30:39.103
I feel like me gooch
is being sanded down.

30:39.170 --> 30:40.972
Me bum cheeks are stuck together.

30:41.039 --> 30:43.041
Oh, no.
No, I'm having a nightmare.

30:43.107 --> 30:44.709
Back to the drawing board.

30:50.648 --> 30:54.252
We're going to Madame Koos tonight
and things are gonna go off.

31:00.558 --> 31:04.095
We get to Madame Koos and I just
want everyone to go pure radge.

31:22.447 --> 31:25.883
I've had enough of Gary trying
to stand in between me and Aaron.

31:25.950 --> 31:29.454
I don't give a shit about Gary
and I know Aaron wants to go there,

31:29.520 --> 31:30.855
so I'm gonna go for it.

31:37.629 --> 31:40.732
I'm not giving in,
I'm sticking by the lad code.

31:46.304 --> 31:49.474
Fuck me, this girl
does not take no for an answer.

31:59.384 --> 32:00.485
(screams)

32:00.551 --> 32:03.388
It's so annoying,
I know Aaron wants to kiss us back,

32:03.454 --> 32:04.722
but he won't cos of Gary.

32:10.895 --> 32:13.965
I'm all for strong women
going for what they want in life

32:14.032 --> 32:17.368
and grabbing Aaron by the face,
but the fact of the matter is,

32:17.435 --> 32:20.171
you've just been custard-pied
right to the dish.

32:23.708 --> 32:26.077
Gary's not gonna have
control over me,

32:26.144 --> 32:28.546
and I'm not keeping me mouth shut
any longer.

32:38.056 --> 32:42.627
Marnie's telling me that Gary has
broke his own fucking lad code.

32:42.694 --> 32:47.365
That means everything he said up
until this point is utter bollocks.

32:52.403 --> 32:55.006
Her and Aaron are free
to do what they want,

32:55.073 --> 32:58.409
and I guarantee Scotty's gonna have
something to say about it.

32:58.476 --> 33:00.011
Tonight got interesting.

33:23.167 --> 33:24.168
(yelling)

33:24.235 --> 33:27.905
I'm not hiding the fact that me
and Gary slept together that quick,

33:27.972 --> 33:32.610
but I'm not Scott's friend, Gary is,
his lad code is bollocks.

33:37.715 --> 33:40.852
Oh, my God,
the truth is finally out the bag.

33:40.918 --> 33:43.955
When Scott finds out,
he's gonna go mad.

33:56.534 --> 34:00.371
Gary knows he's in the wrong, it's
not on, someone needs to tell him.

34:17.321 --> 34:20.358
Holly's asking me about when
I left the house last time,

34:20.425 --> 34:22.092
what is she going on about?

34:22.159 --> 34:24.795
What I do outside this house
is my business.

34:31.469 --> 34:34.138
I can't believe Gary
would lie like that.

34:34.205 --> 34:37.308
Now this has come out,
shit's gonna hit the fan.

34:44.649 --> 34:48.052
Aaron is paralytic and
Marnie's putting a right shift in,

34:48.119 --> 34:51.989
I don't think I've ever seen
a girl graft so hard.

35:06.671 --> 35:08.506
If I was Aaron, I'd just go for it,

35:08.573 --> 35:11.442
cos Gaz has already said
he wants nowt to do with her,

35:11.509 --> 35:13.077
so why would he be bothered?

35:19.317 --> 35:20.785
Shit, I can't do it,

35:20.852 --> 35:24.188
I can't tell Scott about what
happened with Gary and Marnie,

35:24.255 --> 35:25.723
I'm too scared.

35:30.761 --> 35:35.132
It should be Gary who tells him,
his best friend.

35:37.568 --> 35:42.006
Me and Holly have been flirting,
I can tell which way this is going.

35:48.646 --> 35:51.482
I'm starting to realise that
I do really fancy Kyle,

35:51.549 --> 35:53.384
and I wanted to be sassy this time,

35:53.451 --> 35:56.854
but fuck it, I'm a slut at heart,
why should I fight it?

36:00.091 --> 36:02.560
Looks like tonight is
hate Gary night,

36:02.627 --> 36:06.664
so let's put another spanner
in the works, Vicky, come here.

36:06.731 --> 36:10.735
I'm absolutely mortal, whirling
round like a crazy tornado,

36:10.801 --> 36:13.638
and look what gets stuck in my wake,
Gary.

36:17.308 --> 36:22.046
I'm kissing Gary?
I'm necking on with Vicky?

36:23.514 --> 36:25.483
Oh, my God, why am I kissing Gary?!

36:27.852 --> 36:30.955
Vicky and Gary? Gary and Vicky?

36:31.856 --> 36:33.591
Vicky, stop kissing Gary!

36:35.159 --> 36:37.328
Eurgh! Eurgh!

36:38.596 --> 36:42.199
Stop it!
You don't know where he's been!

36:43.401 --> 36:46.671
(gags)

36:56.714 --> 36:59.884
What the actual fuck?!

36:59.951 --> 37:03.454
Vicky and Gary have just necked on.

37:03.521 --> 37:04.555
Eh?!

37:08.025 --> 37:10.061
Tonight, 100%, has been a disaster.

37:10.127 --> 37:12.797
Fuck it, I'm getting my new missus,
I'm going home.

37:17.368 --> 37:18.903
Fuck it all!

37:18.970 --> 37:22.440
If he slept with Marnie, he needs
to man the fuck up and admit it.

37:22.506 --> 37:26.043
Looking to bang your friend, I will.
I would never do that to you.

37:27.545 --> 37:30.848
He's been banging on about lad code,
what a fucking dick.

37:30.915 --> 37:36.520
Finally me and Kyle are having sex,
bye-bye sassy, hello slutty.

37:36.587 --> 37:39.223
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

37:41.125 --> 37:41.325
.

37:43.928 --> 37:44.128
.

37:56.307 --> 38:00.211
We get back and I don't know what
day it is, but Vicky's worse.

38:00.277 --> 38:02.413
I feel sorry for
whoever gets in her way.

38:08.386 --> 38:11.889
I've drank myself to that really
horrible angry stage of drunk.

38:15.426 --> 38:20.131
Anyone who gets in my way will get
Volcano Vicky treatment, big style.

38:22.266 --> 38:24.535
What the fuck?
Why is Vicky kicking off?

38:24.602 --> 38:27.638
I think her head is
literally gonna explode.

38:27.705 --> 38:29.807
(smashing)

38:32.076 --> 38:34.545
Absolutely no good
has come of tonight.

38:34.612 --> 38:38.249
I've tashed on with me arch nemesis,
fuck this, I'm gan yam.

38:38.315 --> 38:39.784
Eh?

38:41.652 --> 38:43.454
Vicky's went home,

38:43.521 --> 38:47.124
and I can't believe Scott hasn't
found out about Gaz and Marnie yet,

38:47.191 --> 38:48.826
it's time someone told him.

39:02.473 --> 39:06.377
I fucking knew it, that little
weasel Gaz has lied to us again,

39:06.444 --> 39:09.046
but I wanna hear the words
come from his own mouth.

39:36.507 --> 39:38.642
I confront Gary
about what's going on,

39:38.709 --> 39:41.612
and all he's doing is mumbling
talking loads of shit.

39:41.679 --> 39:44.548
I know the kid's lying,
he's got one chance to tell us

39:44.615 --> 39:45.750
or I'll go berserk.

39:47.718 --> 39:49.854
Fucking awful!

39:54.024 --> 39:57.261
The more I'm not telling Scott,
the angrier he's getting.

39:57.328 --> 40:01.065
I'm not speaking to him in here, we
need to get outside and sort it out.

40:04.001 --> 40:07.171
Gaz is being a fucking coward,
if he slept with Marnie,

40:07.238 --> 40:09.406
he needs to man the fuck up
and admit it.

40:18.282 --> 40:20.217
Scott seems to forget all the times

40:20.284 --> 40:22.219
I had chance to bang her
and didn't.

40:22.286 --> 40:25.189
That is fucking shit.

40:30.227 --> 40:33.998
I've never seen Scott so angry,
I need to split this up.

40:37.401 --> 40:40.905
The last I checked, Marnie and Scott
left this house "friends",

40:40.971 --> 40:43.240
and if you won't bang your "friend",
I will.

40:51.015 --> 40:54.451
Gaz has not only fucked me over,
he's fucked over Aaron as well,

40:54.518 --> 40:57.321
he stopped him getting with Marnie
cos of lad code,

40:57.388 --> 41:01.225
when he couldn't wait two minutes
before getting with her after I did.

41:02.793 --> 41:04.528
On who?

41:06.063 --> 41:09.366
He's banged on about lad code
and stabbed Scott in the back,

41:09.433 --> 41:11.535
what a fucking dick.

41:24.415 --> 41:27.017
Everything's kicking off
with Scott and Gary,

41:27.084 --> 41:30.087
but I'm just in this massive
sexual zorb with me and Kyle,

41:30.154 --> 41:32.690
and we're just rolling
towards the shag pad.

41:47.504 --> 41:51.308
Tonight for me has been a fucking
disaster, everyone's hating on us,

41:51.375 --> 41:54.078
there's no way I'm staying,
I'm off home.

42:03.354 --> 42:07.358
I'm not arsed about Gaz and Marnie,
it's after everything that happened,

42:07.424 --> 42:09.627
he lies and I caught the kid out.

42:09.693 --> 42:11.295
See ya.
Night, Scott.

42:18.369 --> 42:21.538
Gary's lad code has never existed,
not for him anyway,

42:21.605 --> 42:24.508
I can't believe he's mugged us off
like that, prick.

42:29.847 --> 42:32.249
Fuck this, I'm off to spoon Marnie.

42:32.316 --> 42:34.051
Come on.

42:36.120 --> 42:38.756
Marnie, you all right?

42:43.427 --> 42:45.729
Finally, me and Kyle are having sex,

42:45.796 --> 42:48.399
and to be honest,
it's really, really good sex.

42:48.465 --> 42:51.068
Bye-bye Sassy, hello Slutty.

42:53.637 --> 42:56.941
Fuck me, I've either burst
the water bed or made Holly's night.

42:57.007 --> 43:00.544
(panting)

43:11.121 --> 43:15.059
I'm glad Gary's left the house, and
if he thinks he fucked things up,

43:15.125 --> 43:18.128
he's got another thing coming,
cos now I'm in her bed.

43:23.067 --> 43:26.303
We're doing an assault course.
You shot us in the dick!

43:26.370 --> 43:29.840
I've gotta clean a bar with Gaz
as punishment.

43:29.907 --> 43:32.576
If I don't get an apology,
me and him are done.

43:32.643 --> 43:36.046
Tonight is the last night, and I'm
gonna end this with a bang.

43:36.113 --> 43:39.583
(moaning) I've woke up this morning
in bed with Gary,

43:39.650 --> 43:41.251
this is an all-time low.

43:41.318 --> 43:43.220
(both)
Geordie Shore wedding.

43:43.287 --> 43:45.389
This wedding is just weird.
Rejoice!

43:45.456 --> 43:50.227
I turn round and I see Holly walking
down the aisle, I'm shitting meself.

43:50.294 --> 43:51.362
It's been amazing.
