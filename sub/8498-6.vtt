<b><font color="#0E7521">Ripped By mstoll</font></b>

00:33.840 --> 00:38.152
<i>A sense of community
is the Holy Grail of modern living.</i>

00:38.560 --> 00:40.869
<i>When we cannot find it
in the present day,</i>

00:40.960 --> 00:45.590
<i>we reach back through the years and say,
"That was when we knew each other.</i>"

00:45.720 --> 00:48.234
<i>"That was when we held
all things in common."</i>

00:48.840 --> 00:52.310
<i>It is a thought so tender and consoling</i>

00:52.800 --> 00:55.678
<i>that it scarcely matters
if it is not true.</i>

00:56.240 --> 00:59.710
<i>Past perfection is a wondrous thing.</i>

01:11.600 --> 01:15.036
The Bible had a plague of locusts,
we have a plague of pensioners.

01:15.120 --> 01:17.554
Scarcely a crumb left in their wake.

01:17.840 --> 01:20.434
I'm sorry to say that I've just had
my bottom pinched.

01:20.880 --> 01:22.791
I think that's Mr Pillbean.

01:22.880 --> 01:24.280
The man on the right trestle table.

01:24.680 --> 01:26.591
- You too?
- Twice.

01:27.000 --> 01:28.991
I asked Tom to give him a hard,
cold stare

01:29.080 --> 01:30.520
but it didn't discourage him at all.

01:31.200 --> 01:32.394
Afternoon, dear.

01:33.320 --> 01:35.151
Mrs Hills, how lovely to see you!

01:35.240 --> 01:36.434
Hello, Nurse Franklin.

01:36.520 --> 01:37.816
I heard this year's funds
wouldn't stretch

01:37.840 --> 01:39.400
to taking the old folks to the seaside,

01:39.440 --> 01:41.096
so I thought I'd bring
a bit of the seaside to them.

01:41.120 --> 01:42.633
Oh, that's so kind!

01:42.760 --> 01:44.000
You must stay for a cup of tea.

01:44.240 --> 01:47.391
Look, I can't stop long.
Left my Diane looking after the stall.

01:48.040 --> 01:50.720
There's no harm in taking the weight
off your feet for five minutes.

01:51.400 --> 01:54.551
Especially given your
rather interesting condition.

01:54.640 --> 01:55.755
This?

01:56.160 --> 01:57.878
This? Yes, number five.

01:58.360 --> 02:00.032
It's gets to be like shelling peas.

02:00.120 --> 02:04.079
I seem to remember that we helped
shell peas number two, three and four.

02:04.520 --> 02:06.272
I hope we haven't
done nothing to offend.

02:06.600 --> 02:08.396
I'm going to the clinic
at St Cuthbert's.

02:09.280 --> 02:12.272
They want me to have it in hospital
on account of my age.

02:12.760 --> 02:14.656
Well, they're obviously taking
very good care of you

02:14.680 --> 02:16.193
because you look extremely well.

02:16.600 --> 02:18.033
I'm an old hand, Mrs Turner.

02:21.000 --> 02:23.639
The autoclave is coming to the end
of its cycle.

02:24.440 --> 02:27.398
I shall replenish your instruments
as soon as it concludes.

02:27.480 --> 02:28.708
Thank you, Nurse Crane.

02:28.960 --> 02:31.713
They said they'd come and repair
the one at the surgery tomorrow.

02:32.200 --> 02:33.758
Oh, Doctor, whatever is this?

02:34.320 --> 02:35.320
Cornish pasty.

02:35.400 --> 02:38.597
Or, more precisely, half of one!

02:38.760 --> 02:41.035
And would it have killed you
to sit down for five minutes

02:41.120 --> 02:42.633
and eat the whole thing?

02:44.520 --> 02:47.717
Now, hop it and put your feet up
in the parlour

02:47.800 --> 02:49.631
while I sort you out some instruments.

02:54.400 --> 02:56.914
Mr Pillbean has demanded a refill.

02:57.000 --> 02:59.275
I think he just might find
we keep him waiting.

02:59.760 --> 03:02.433
Shelagh, did you know Mrs Hills
was expecting again?

03:02.520 --> 03:03.635
Not until now.

03:03.880 --> 03:05.840
I just wondered who referred her
to St Cuthbert's.

03:05.880 --> 03:08.314
Frightfully sorry.
Creamless scone alert.

03:08.400 --> 03:09.799
Run out of cream again?

03:09.920 --> 03:12.456
I think certain guests have been
taking more than their fair share.

03:12.480 --> 03:16.234
I threatened to put one man over my knee
but it only encouraged him.

03:16.320 --> 03:17.320
Timothy!

03:18.320 --> 03:19.616
Please don't make me play any more.

03:19.640 --> 03:20.959
You've done your bit, dear.

03:21.120 --> 03:24.237
Now, run inside and open
three more tins of Nestle's cream.

03:24.400 --> 03:27.312
In the meantime, I popped into
you-know-where last night

03:27.400 --> 03:29.550
and you-know-what's ready
for you-know-when.

03:30.160 --> 03:31.720
I think you better take charge of this.

03:39.360 --> 03:40.475
Dad.

03:40.560 --> 03:41.560
Dad!

03:42.480 --> 03:46.393
What? I was just waiting
for the autoclave to finish.

03:46.680 --> 03:47.795
You need a holiday.

03:48.000 --> 03:50.594
Nobody ever needs a holiday, Timothy.

03:51.240 --> 03:54.676
Which isn't to say
it wouldn't be a nice thing to have.

03:58.680 --> 04:01.956
Tom, I think that was one of
the best films I've ever seen.

04:02.040 --> 04:03.951
No wonder we couldn't get tickets
last week.

04:04.160 --> 04:06.480
<i>Whistle Down in the Wind</i>
is a bit of a funny title, though.

04:06.680 --> 04:08.480
It doesn't even hint
at the Christian message.

04:08.840 --> 04:10.478
Maybe that's a good thing.

04:11.600 --> 04:14.478
I think we ought to go again
and take the Sunday school with us.

04:15.640 --> 04:18.712
See, I am nothing
if not an incurable romantic.

04:19.640 --> 04:22.677
That sounds splendid. On one condition.

04:24.920 --> 04:26.239
What?

04:26.440 --> 04:28.715
That you promise to bring
the parish sweetie jar

04:28.800 --> 04:30.711
and fill it with sherbet lollies.

04:31.960 --> 04:33.678
Actually...

04:35.320 --> 04:37.356
- Oh!
- Purple and green.

04:37.720 --> 04:39.039
My favourite.

04:39.120 --> 04:40.997
I wanted to give it to you
in the pictures

04:41.080 --> 04:42.752
but there were too many people looking.

04:42.840 --> 04:43.989
Well...

04:44.520 --> 04:45.840
Well, there's no one looking now.

04:51.360 --> 04:54.511
- Help me! Help me, please!
- Oh!

04:54.600 --> 04:56.238
Help me!

04:56.480 --> 04:58.948
It's all right. It's all right.
You're safe. You're safe now.

04:59.040 --> 05:01.554
- Fetch the police.
- No, no. Please, not the police.

05:05.120 --> 05:06.951
I'm sorry, Lizzie,
it won't sting for long.

05:09.240 --> 05:10.639
It's well sugared.

05:11.080 --> 05:12.957
- Do you mind if I smoke?
- Not at all.

05:14.640 --> 05:15.868
Here.

05:17.880 --> 05:19.472
It's all right, Lizzie.

05:21.120 --> 05:22.235
You're safe here.

05:28.600 --> 05:30.795
- I should go.
- I can walk you to the police station.

05:31.520 --> 05:32.999
After Nurse Gilbert's tidied you up.

05:33.160 --> 05:34.513
No, I told you.

05:34.600 --> 05:37.353
I got enough to worry about
without a conviction for soliciting.

05:38.640 --> 05:42.189
I think you might be bruised
where your blouse is torn.

05:42.280 --> 05:45.511
Would you let me have a
look and perhaps put some arnica on it?

05:50.360 --> 05:52.669
- He bit you!
- Oh, it could have been worse.

05:53.360 --> 05:55.476
The other girls say the johns
get up to all kinds.

05:55.560 --> 05:56.736
But I haven't been doing it long.

05:56.760 --> 05:58.273
- Oh...
- Oh, I have to go.

05:58.520 --> 05:59.953
- Lizzie...
- I have to.

06:00.080 --> 06:01.559
I have to get back to my kids.

06:05.320 --> 06:06.639
How awful.

06:06.800 --> 06:09.758
We were only waiting up to see
if you'd help Delia with her bust darts.

06:10.200 --> 06:12.839
It's all hands on deck
once I start tangling with bodices.

06:13.080 --> 06:14.832
I'm a terrible seamstress.

06:14.960 --> 06:18.589
There was nowhere she could turn to.
No one who would help her.

06:18.880 --> 06:19.949
Apart from you.

06:20.040 --> 06:22.031
A few kind words
and a bit of antiseptic.

06:22.600 --> 06:24.960
There's nothing to stop you
from reporting it to the police.

06:25.040 --> 06:26.234
Perhaps you should.

06:26.520 --> 06:28.909
It can't do any harm.
It might make you feel better.

06:29.000 --> 06:30.956
Hello, girls. How was your evening?

06:31.040 --> 06:33.474
Well, er, we enjoyed the film.

06:33.640 --> 06:34.993
How was art history?

06:35.080 --> 06:38.470
Riveting. We're doing Vermeer.
I can't resist a good interior.

06:38.960 --> 06:42.077
I wondered if things had gotten a
bit emotional. Your mascara's run a bit.

06:42.160 --> 06:45.118
Oh. I sat upstairs on the bus,
it got wretchedly smoky.

06:45.680 --> 06:46.908
Is that Ovaltine?

07:02.520 --> 07:06.308
- Mum, can I come in?
- In a minute. I'm not decent.

07:06.440 --> 07:08.112
I really need to go, Mum!

07:11.400 --> 07:12.674
Lovely and fresh.

07:12.760 --> 07:14.716
Make sure you fry them
in some nice clean lard.

07:15.240 --> 07:16.680
Nice clean pavement is what we want.

07:16.760 --> 07:19.638
Can't be selling fish from a pitch
with spit and fag ends all underfoot.

07:19.880 --> 07:22.633
- Mrs Hills.
- Yes, dear?

07:22.840 --> 07:26.628
Just a thank-you note for your
contribution to the pensioner's tea.

07:26.880 --> 07:28.279
You're welcome.

07:28.480 --> 07:30.040
I'll be a pensioner myself soon enough.

07:30.120 --> 07:32.376
Could have told your Ralph that
before he had his way with you.

07:32.400 --> 07:34.994
Don't work too hard, Mrs Hills.

07:35.360 --> 07:36.839
Hey, you heard the nurse, Diane.

07:37.200 --> 07:38.679
You'll be doing the heavy stuff.

07:38.760 --> 07:40.880
You're not leaving it all to your ma
in her condition!

07:41.040 --> 07:42.816
Well, Diane's better at all
the adding and subtracting

07:42.840 --> 07:44.990
- then I'll ever be, Vera.
- Oh.

07:45.160 --> 07:47.071
Any idiot can do the donkeywork.

07:49.240 --> 07:51.356
A bite mark?
I'm sorry you had to see that.

07:51.880 --> 07:55.031
Oh, I'm perfectly all right.
But this woman, Lizzie,

07:55.360 --> 07:57.794
she looked as if she'd been attacked
by an animal.

07:57.880 --> 07:59.256
There's things that go on around here

07:59.280 --> 08:00.416
that you don't want to trouble
your head with.

08:00.440 --> 08:03.398
Sergeant, we've had working girls
on our midwifery books

08:03.480 --> 08:05.710
and we see them in the doctor's
when they have VD.

08:05.880 --> 08:07.108
This was different.

08:07.280 --> 08:10.397
She suffered as a consequence
not of sex, but of violence.

08:11.040 --> 08:13.554
We can't do anything unless
she makes a formal complaint.

08:13.640 --> 08:16.916
But she can't! Because she thinks
she's the criminal.

08:17.440 --> 08:19.510
Well, legally,
they're both in the wrong.

08:19.640 --> 08:21.198
He beat her up, of course, but

08:21.640 --> 08:25.076
if she was out soliciting
she could get a £60 fine or jail.

08:25.280 --> 08:27.077
Even for just loitering on the pavement.

08:27.160 --> 08:29.594
And if she's got children,
like she said,

08:29.680 --> 08:31.200
it's not going to end well for anyone.

08:31.320 --> 08:32.673
It's not right, though, is it?

08:32.919 --> 08:34.034
It's the law.

08:39.200 --> 08:40.394
Ah, Sister.

08:40.480 --> 08:42.471
I was not sure if you had been
called out yet.

08:42.960 --> 08:44.496
It's no doubt the calm before the storm,

08:44.520 --> 08:46.829
but the phone hasn't
rung once this morning.

08:47.360 --> 08:49.828
I thought I'd get ahead
with the chapel flowers.

08:50.200 --> 08:52.350
And some for your office.

08:54.320 --> 08:56.754
You have a knack for floristry, Sister.

08:58.360 --> 08:59.839
And a very sweet voice.

09:00.600 --> 09:01.953
A sweet voice?

09:02.120 --> 09:04.395
And in chapel I can hardly hear you.

09:05.520 --> 09:09.638
If we are to praise the Lord in song,
we should do it gladly.

09:09.960 --> 09:11.632
And as loudly as possible.

09:11.720 --> 09:16.748
Oh, Sister Julienne,
I'm always afraid of singing too loudly.

09:18.080 --> 09:20.071
When I was a postulant we were told

09:20.160 --> 09:22.469
never to draw attention to ourselves
in any way

09:22.560 --> 09:24.869
because it was a sign of pride.

09:25.320 --> 09:27.151
Now I've drawn attention to myself by...

09:27.240 --> 09:29.151
Not singing loudly enough.

09:31.080 --> 09:34.277
I always find that if I feel singled out

09:34.400 --> 09:38.439
for either praise or blame,
the best response is to offer it up

09:39.160 --> 09:42.550
and say, "What good would this
do for others?"

09:43.760 --> 09:44.909
Of course, Sister.

09:45.120 --> 09:47.156
And if you could raise your voice
with us

09:48.600 --> 09:51.910
it would make us feel so very blessed.

09:54.760 --> 09:56.113
Thank you.

09:59.960 --> 10:01.791
I thought that nurse
seemed nice this morning.

10:03.800 --> 10:06.109
I just think we'd be better off
getting one of them in.

10:06.320 --> 10:07.719
Diane, we've discussed this.

10:07.840 --> 10:10.479
You mean you've discussed it,
with yourself.

10:11.200 --> 10:13.360
You want an argument, Diane,
turn round and look at me.

10:13.400 --> 10:15.789
I don't want to turn round
and I don't want to look at you.

10:16.440 --> 10:19.512
Because if I do, I see you putting
your hand on your back

10:19.600 --> 10:23.309
and rubbing your belly and
huffing and puffing when you bend over.

10:24.600 --> 10:26.830
And I can't do any of those things.

10:28.960 --> 10:32.032
Diane, you've brought all of this
on yourself!

10:32.440 --> 10:34.556
Running round with some lad
from a building site

10:34.640 --> 10:36.631
who legged it
without leaving his address.

10:36.880 --> 10:38.074
What's gonna happen, Mum?

10:39.200 --> 10:40.400
I know what's going to happen.

10:41.680 --> 10:44.194
You're gonna have it here
and I'm gonna look after you.

10:44.640 --> 10:45.880
We're gonna say that it's mine.

10:45.960 --> 10:49.509
I mean, what's gonna happen?
How will it get out?

10:49.600 --> 10:52.034
I'll take you through that
when your time comes.

10:52.280 --> 10:54.416
Which please, God, will be before
your dad gets back from sea,

10:54.440 --> 10:56.112
'cause I don't fancy
your chances at all.

10:56.240 --> 10:58.336
Why don't you just send me up
to that mother and baby place

10:58.360 --> 10:59.509
like Janice Meyers?

10:59.600 --> 11:02.160
Because Janice Meyers
is shoddy goods for life,

11:02.240 --> 11:04.708
and she's gonna come back
here empty-handed.

11:06.560 --> 11:09.870
Listen, Diane, you are not the first
and you won't be the last.

11:10.880 --> 11:13.416
I know of three or four families
where the baby's grown up thinking

11:13.440 --> 11:15.431
- its mother's its sister.
- Who?

11:16.040 --> 11:17.234
Never you mind who.

11:17.760 --> 11:20.240
Go and get your apron on before
your brothers get in from Cubs.

11:21.120 --> 11:25.591
All right.
Only watch out, your pillow's slipping.

11:36.320 --> 11:38.356
Oh, dear, someone's out of sorts.

11:38.560 --> 11:41.916
My baby's out of sorts.
He never stops crying.

11:42.000 --> 11:43.752
I'm scared
there's something wrong with him.

11:44.400 --> 11:46.231
Dear me, young man!

11:46.320 --> 11:50.757
It's only a post-natal check-up.
No need to be so vexed.

11:52.320 --> 11:54.914
Why don't we see who's free,
bump you up the queue a bit.

11:56.120 --> 11:58.680
I can't find any reason
to refer him to Doctor.

11:59.800 --> 12:01.791
There's a possibility
it's a touch of colic.

12:02.160 --> 12:03.957
And we can keep an eye on that together.

12:05.240 --> 12:06.514
Now, Mrs Coleman.

12:07.680 --> 12:08.829
Are you getting any sleep?

12:10.280 --> 12:11.880
I'm walking the floors again
most nights.

12:12.320 --> 12:14.176
My husband has to get up
at the crack of dawn for work,

12:14.200 --> 12:15.320
it's his sleep that matters.

12:15.840 --> 12:19.435
Well, you won't be able to take care
of Michael properly if you're exhausted.

12:21.920 --> 12:24.070
While the nights are still so mild

12:24.560 --> 12:29.156
a gentle bedtime walk in the
fresh air might do you both good.

12:32.840 --> 12:34.353
I'll try anything, Sister.

12:38.960 --> 12:40.791
How many doors is it? Just one door?

12:42.560 --> 12:44.391
It's time to come
to the table, Patrick.

12:44.600 --> 12:47.114
There's something extra special
for dinner this evening.

12:47.200 --> 12:48.394
Oh, what's all this?

12:48.480 --> 12:53.190
Chicken a la king, with
piped mashed potato and creamed spinach.

12:53.320 --> 12:57.233
Please note the ornamental
folded serviettes. All my own work.

12:57.320 --> 13:00.471
And copied out of <i>Woman's Realm</i>
at Mum's insistence.

13:00.840 --> 13:03.593
We never have serviettes
on a weeknight.

13:03.680 --> 13:05.511
Well, we're having them today.

13:05.960 --> 13:08.030
In fact, we're going
to indulge ourselves

13:08.240 --> 13:10.913
in every conceivable
luxury and refinement.

13:11.360 --> 13:13.590
Because tomorrow we're going...

13:14.400 --> 13:15.628
Camping!

13:16.280 --> 13:18.555
No, Dad, we really are!

13:20.320 --> 13:23.551
I've got work tomorrow, Shelagh.
And so have you!

13:23.640 --> 13:26.074
Absolutely everything is in hand.

13:26.560 --> 13:29.199
We've arranged locum cover for a week

13:29.520 --> 13:31.476
and Sister Julienne is fully in support.

13:31.840 --> 13:33.068
The locum's called Dr Godfrey

13:33.160 --> 13:36.470
and she's even offered him lodgings
at Nonnatus while we're away.

13:36.560 --> 13:38.790
Michaela's arranged for us
to borrow two tents

13:38.920 --> 13:40.911
and as much of the Cub's equipment
as we need.

13:41.280 --> 13:44.078
Mum's even bought a little half-sized
sleeping bag for Angela.

13:44.160 --> 13:45.513
Really?

13:46.080 --> 13:47.274
Really.

13:48.440 --> 13:49.919
I couldn't be happier.

13:51.680 --> 13:52.908
Oh...

13:56.920 --> 13:58.831
Very prettily done, Sister.

14:00.880 --> 14:02.632
But you cannot tempt me.

14:03.840 --> 14:07.958
Everyone has noticed that you aren't
eating properly at mealtime, Sister.

14:08.200 --> 14:10.509
My strength comes from another source.

14:12.040 --> 14:14.918
And I hope you do not need to ask
from whence.

14:15.040 --> 14:17.190
No, of course not, but...

14:17.360 --> 14:20.591
How recently did you study
for novice's vows?

14:21.000 --> 14:24.788
Were you not apprised of the practice
or mortification of the flesh?

14:24.880 --> 14:26.108
Yes.

14:27.080 --> 14:28.672
Are you trying to fast?

14:29.280 --> 14:34.308
I have few joys
and, therefore, little to surrender.

14:34.840 --> 14:40.551
But, Sister, you found the Lenten fast
very hard. Why now?

14:41.280 --> 14:46.559
I am in fair health now
and able to sustain the sacrifice.

14:47.360 --> 14:52.115
But, Sister, if you want to fast,

14:52.400 --> 14:55.039
you must tell the rest of the community
what you're doing.

14:55.320 --> 14:57.072
That way we can uphold you.

15:00.440 --> 15:01.839
Very well.

15:02.520 --> 15:05.478
You may remove
this platter of frivolities.

15:05.560 --> 15:06.913
Of course.

15:12.920 --> 15:14.990
Good Scout army surplus.

15:15.120 --> 15:17.156
Perfect for a week in the New Forest.

15:17.240 --> 15:20.869
Patsy says they've been serving
the Cubs of Poplar for 15 years.

15:21.480 --> 15:24.472
I remember this one from when we
did our camping badge at Selsey Bill.

15:24.960 --> 15:26.791
It's got bullet holes along the ridge.

15:26.880 --> 15:29.440
I'm quite sure
they're not bullet holes, Timothy.

15:29.520 --> 15:32.193
- They were probably made by moths.
- Or mice.

15:32.840 --> 15:34.831
It does all smell rather musty.

15:36.160 --> 15:37.912
There's mould in this billycan.

15:38.000 --> 15:40.639
Oh, it just needs a quick swill
in some hot water.

15:40.720 --> 15:42.472
Shelagh!

15:43.040 --> 15:47.556
This holiday is about getting back to
nature and being together as a family.

15:48.240 --> 15:49.673
We'll enjoy it, won't we?

15:49.800 --> 15:52.473
Yes, we will. Because we've earned it.

16:11.120 --> 16:12.599
I love you.

16:13.560 --> 16:15.676
I love you, Michael,
but you're gonna kill me.

16:18.880 --> 16:21.394
We did the right thing
putting you on iron tablets.

16:22.480 --> 16:26.075
I don't reckon you're anaemic.
That's good going for nine months.

16:27.040 --> 16:28.268
I was anaemic with all of you.

16:29.240 --> 16:30.958
Makes me feel sick when I see all that.

16:32.320 --> 16:36.438
I've had four and everything's in hand.
Put it out of your mind.

16:39.560 --> 16:42.518
We have two or three ladies on
our books who are very close to term.

16:42.600 --> 16:44.352
Their records have already been moved...

16:44.520 --> 16:47.478
To the green filing cabinet
over in the maternity home.

16:48.000 --> 16:50.878
They're also double copied
to the Nonnatus House log

16:51.000 --> 16:55.357
and my own personal Rolodex
which is widely held to be infallible.

16:55.440 --> 16:58.273
Rolodex?
I like the sound of that, Nurse Cray.

16:58.480 --> 16:59.674
Crane.

17:00.200 --> 17:01.633
As in the wading bird.

17:01.880 --> 17:04.758
Or industry lifting equipment,
whichever you prefer.

17:06.560 --> 17:08.790
Also, clinic is on Friday afternoons.

17:08.960 --> 17:11.997
We've been experimenting
with a new antibiotic powder.

17:12.079 --> 17:14.913
Which I will be delighted to discuss
with Dr Godfrey.

17:15.000 --> 17:17.958
It's cutting-edge stuff like this
that brings me out of retirement

17:18.040 --> 17:19.519
time and time again.

17:19.920 --> 17:21.319
I imagine you feel the same.

17:23.480 --> 17:24.878
I shall consider retirement

17:24.960 --> 17:27.428
as and when I reach the appropriate age,
Dr Godfrey.

17:27.680 --> 17:29.591
Which will not be for some years.

17:30.920 --> 17:35.596
Shelagh, I can get the tents or
the children in the car, but not both.

17:35.840 --> 17:39.435
May I refer you to my earlier offer
to loan you my roof rack

17:39.520 --> 17:42.512
- which you declined?
- You may.

17:43.800 --> 17:46.598
I left it out for you in the hall
at Nonnatus House.

17:49.760 --> 17:50.795
Thank you.

17:54.600 --> 17:55.715
Hmm!

18:01.680 --> 18:04.877
I keep wanting to avert my eyes,
but they're just too compelling.

18:04.960 --> 18:07.554
I think shorts are a very
practical choice for a camping holiday

18:07.640 --> 18:09.000
and not amusing in any way at all!

18:10.400 --> 18:12.356
Well, I'm not looking. Really, I'm not.

18:12.440 --> 18:14.795
You could launch this car
like the <i>Sputnik</i>

18:14.880 --> 18:17.633
and this roof rack
would not budge an inch.

18:18.400 --> 18:21.517
Patrick, we need to get going,
it's already starting to rain.

18:21.840 --> 18:24.229
Fear not, Mrs T,
Nurse Gilbert is on the case.

18:24.360 --> 18:25.475
What is it?

18:25.760 --> 18:28.354
I thought it might help keep
the things on the roof rack dry.

18:28.440 --> 18:30.431
It's an incontinence sheet
from the charity box.

18:30.560 --> 18:31.629
Perfect.

18:31.720 --> 18:33.472
I hope it doesn't smell of urine.

18:35.080 --> 18:37.640
Oh, by the way, Doc, I like the shorts.

18:38.120 --> 18:40.031
I had a pair like that in El-Alamein.

18:40.280 --> 18:42.271
I had a pair in Monte Cassino.

18:42.400 --> 18:44.197
No wonder we won the war.

18:51.000 --> 18:53.878
The place is upside down, Sister,
I wasn't expecting you.

18:54.520 --> 18:56.317
I happened to be passing.

18:56.400 --> 18:59.312
I thought I'd see if this young man
had started behaving himself.

18:59.880 --> 19:01.233
He's all right.

19:01.880 --> 19:05.509
Did you try taking him for a walk
to settle him at bedtime?

19:05.920 --> 19:07.638
I told you, he's all right.

19:09.120 --> 19:11.395
Judith, your face.

19:12.640 --> 19:13.834
Oh, er...

19:14.720 --> 19:15.994
I've always been clumsy.

19:16.280 --> 19:18.157
It's even worse now
I don't get any sleep.

19:18.240 --> 19:19.240
What happened?

19:19.480 --> 19:21.471
I clumped myself one
with the wardrobe door.

19:24.680 --> 19:28.468
Things can take time to settle down
when a newborn comes along.

19:28.640 --> 19:30.710
We're here to help,
whatever upsets you're having.

19:32.480 --> 19:34.198
Oh...

19:37.360 --> 19:43.037
Cry as much as you can bear to.
Then tell me why and what I can do.

19:44.520 --> 19:46.954
I can't tell you. I can't.

19:52.720 --> 19:54.039
I can't.

20:00.120 --> 20:01.519
It's such a...

20:01.680 --> 20:02.999
A delicate matter.

20:03.440 --> 20:05.396
But there's a very young baby
in the house.

20:05.480 --> 20:08.278
It's clearly a volatile situation.

20:08.400 --> 20:09.753
- Is she married?
- Yes.

20:10.160 --> 20:14.870
And to a good, steady man,
as far I can tell, but...

20:15.480 --> 20:17.277
Walking into doors is never a good sign.

20:17.840 --> 20:20.991
And getting them to tell the truth
is always difficult.

20:21.520 --> 20:25.274
The thing that disturbed me the most
wasn't the bruise on her face,

20:25.720 --> 20:27.915
it was the one on her neck
by her shoulder.

20:29.160 --> 20:34.518
It looked as if someone
had sunk his teeth into her.

20:34.600 --> 20:35.635
Like a bite mark?

20:35.720 --> 20:37.517
It just looked so vicious.

20:39.960 --> 20:41.518
Let me see if I can make inquiries.

21:35.360 --> 21:36.475
Thank you.

21:36.920 --> 21:38.956
A fine example of labour rewarded.

21:39.320 --> 21:43.518
I haven't seen a spread like this since
the coronation party at my old practice.

21:44.440 --> 21:46.160
You must help me out
with these cream horns.

21:46.200 --> 21:47.315
Allow me.

21:47.400 --> 21:50.836
Sister Monica Joan is eschewing
indulgence for religious reasons,

21:50.920 --> 21:52.911
and I'm partial to flaky pastry.

21:53.800 --> 21:56.075
I'm sorry to intrude, ladies, sir.

21:56.160 --> 21:58.549
How could you possibly intrude,
Sergeant Noakes?

21:58.680 --> 21:59.680
You're one of the family.

21:59.920 --> 22:03.151
I actually called in regards
to the attacks on Judith Coleman

22:03.240 --> 22:05.470
- and the girl on the street.
- Do you mean Lizzie?

22:05.640 --> 22:06.640
Yes.

22:06.760 --> 22:09.035
Because of the similarity
of the bite marks on her neck,

22:09.120 --> 22:11.401
we can't rule out that they
were attacked by the same man.

22:11.600 --> 22:13.280
I suppose that
there's a remote possibility

22:13.320 --> 22:15.276
that it might be
Judith Coleman's husband.

22:15.680 --> 22:16.749
Colin Coleman?

22:16.840 --> 22:19.229
I'm sorry, I've met more aggressive
marshmallow bunnies.

22:19.600 --> 22:20.919
Or that Judith herself

22:21.000 --> 22:22.558
- was out soliciting.
- No.

22:22.680 --> 22:25.148
Well, either way, if the situation
at her home is volatile

22:25.240 --> 22:26.912
as you suggested, Sister Julienne,

22:27.000 --> 22:29.309
we'd put her at risk
if we went round and quizzed him.

22:29.640 --> 22:32.029
So our first port of call
should be the other girl.

22:32.600 --> 22:35.160
Lizzie was adamant that she
wouldn't speak to the police.

22:35.760 --> 22:38.274
If you could come with me,
we might be able to pull her 'round.

22:39.480 --> 22:41.072
May I, Sister Julienne?

22:41.240 --> 22:42.912
I would be grateful if you did.

22:50.120 --> 22:52.031
- Room service.
- Oh, Patrick.

22:52.120 --> 22:55.795
I put a nip of Scotch in
from my handy secret hip flask.

22:55.880 --> 22:57.871
You wouldn't
get that in the Ritz.

23:00.440 --> 23:02.749
Oh! Ooh.

23:04.440 --> 23:07.955
Ooh, at last! My knees are freezing.

23:08.280 --> 23:09.554
Oh, Patrick!

23:09.800 --> 23:11.119
No. No, no.

23:11.240 --> 23:13.913
We're on our holidays,
it doesn't matter.

23:14.400 --> 23:16.994
Your sleeping bag's soaking wet!

23:17.240 --> 23:18.639
At least it's warm wet.

23:22.520 --> 23:23.748
What are you thinking about?

23:24.560 --> 23:27.996
The children. Do you suppose
they'll be all right in their own tent?

23:28.600 --> 23:29.794
Of course they will.

23:29.960 --> 23:31.518
They're only about five feet away.

23:31.960 --> 23:33.439
What if it falls down again?

23:33.760 --> 23:36.320
It won't, I promise you.

23:41.280 --> 23:42.759
What are you thinking about?

23:44.520 --> 23:45.999
The ulcer clinic.

23:47.360 --> 23:50.636
There's a couple of really nasty
chronic venous cases

23:50.720 --> 23:52.358
that aren't responding
to the new regime.

23:52.440 --> 23:53.793
- Patrick.
- I'm sorry!

23:54.600 --> 23:57.068
But I'm just not sure about Godfrey.

23:57.280 --> 24:00.192
General practice
is a young man's game.

24:00.480 --> 24:02.710
You're not supposed to be
thinking about work.

24:04.000 --> 24:05.592
If you don't mind my saying so,

24:05.680 --> 24:07.989
you're not exactly
Cliff Richard yourself.

24:10.080 --> 24:13.356
I could sing a chorus of <i>Summer Holiday</i>
if you'd like me to.

24:15.440 --> 24:16.873
Ah!

24:18.160 --> 24:19.388
Oh, no!

24:19.880 --> 24:22.997
Mum, Dad,
can we come in with you?

24:26.000 --> 24:29.151
The trouble is since the 59 Act most
women have been forced off the kerb

24:29.240 --> 24:31.993
and into brothels and private premises.

24:32.080 --> 24:34.594
It's only the amateurs and
the desperate who risk the streets.

24:35.080 --> 24:37.640
I don't know if Lizzie
was amateur or professional,

24:37.720 --> 24:41.076
but she was desperate, I know that.

24:42.560 --> 24:43.834
She had children.

24:44.160 --> 24:48.631
When I think of my little Freddie
tucked up in his bed, I could cry.

24:49.920 --> 24:52.559
- How is Chummy?
- Excellent, thank you.

24:53.280 --> 24:55.680
She's taken up pottery at night school,
which is interesting.

24:57.560 --> 24:58.879
That's Lizzie.

24:59.160 --> 25:00.559
I remember that coat.

25:06.560 --> 25:07.959
Lizzie?

25:09.000 --> 25:10.752
Please stop. Lizzie!

25:11.560 --> 25:12.993
You're not in any trouble.

25:13.560 --> 25:17.599
My friend, Sergeant Noakes,
just wants to ask you a few questions.

25:18.360 --> 25:21.875
Nurse Gilbert told me what happened.
I'd like to help.

25:23.480 --> 25:24.708
In which case,

25:24.800 --> 25:27.872
the best thing you can do
is find out where my husband went.

25:28.280 --> 25:31.317
Because if you did that,
I wouldn't be having to sell myself

25:31.400 --> 25:35.393
to help feed the kids I had
because I gave myself for nothing

25:36.200 --> 25:38.634
to a man I thought might stick around.

25:40.080 --> 25:42.992
- I'm sorry, Mrs...
- Call me Lizzie.

25:44.080 --> 25:45.718
That's what I say to all the blokes.

25:46.920 --> 25:49.150
And I'm not saying anything else to you.

25:59.600 --> 26:01.431
Morning. Sorry to keep you, Fred.

26:01.840 --> 26:03.353
Or maybe I should call you Mr Buckle,

26:03.440 --> 26:05.176
since I've asked you in
on official business.

26:05.200 --> 26:06.394
Civil defence, Sergeant?

26:06.480 --> 26:09.040
We haven't the manpower
to put extra bobbies on the streets.

26:09.160 --> 26:12.470
And until we're sure these attacks
are connected and ongoing,

26:12.560 --> 26:16.030
I can't apply for reinforcements
from outside the division.

26:16.120 --> 26:19.476
But the CDC can put on extra patrols.

26:19.920 --> 26:22.673
Confidence and safety of the public
is paramount.

26:23.320 --> 26:24.639
It's why we serve.

26:30.200 --> 26:32.589
This is so much nicer
than cooking at home.

26:32.880 --> 26:35.394
The trouble with chest disease,

26:35.520 --> 26:37.795
in the context of
community medicine research...

26:37.880 --> 26:39.871
- Patrick.
- Is that it's largely presumed

26:40.000 --> 26:42.434
to affect the male population
more than the female.

26:42.560 --> 26:44.471
You're talking about work again.

26:45.160 --> 26:46.195
Sorry.

26:46.360 --> 26:48.555
It's the smoke making you cough

26:48.840 --> 26:50.592
- reminding me about...
- Work.

26:50.800 --> 26:52.631
- Mama!
- Mum?

26:52.760 --> 26:53.988
Where's Angela?

26:54.120 --> 26:56.873
She's down here, but she's seen
a squirrel and she won't stop crying.

26:57.000 --> 26:58.433
I knew this would happen.

26:58.560 --> 27:00.039
She's petrified of squirrels.

27:00.120 --> 27:03.237
She doesn't even like Squirrel Nutkin,
and he's only a picture in a book.

27:03.560 --> 27:06.074
It's all right, darling. Mummy's coming!

27:08.880 --> 27:11.269
Tinned rice pudding
and an early night for you tonight.

27:13.880 --> 27:15.393
Mum...

27:18.320 --> 27:20.072
I think I'm gonna wet myself.

27:21.680 --> 27:22.908
Press your legs together.

27:23.360 --> 27:25.237
Don't let anything come out in a rush.

27:31.040 --> 27:32.632
I spy with my little eye,

27:32.720 --> 27:36.952
something beginning with T-F.

27:38.880 --> 27:40.029
Tent flap.

27:40.160 --> 27:42.276
Although the correct term
in actually the "becket".

27:42.360 --> 27:45.033
Is it? Your turn.

27:45.520 --> 27:47.750
And no animals beginning
with "S", please,

27:47.840 --> 27:49.558
because I've just got Angela settled.

27:50.400 --> 27:52.914
I spy with my little eye
something beginning with.

27:54.360 --> 28:00.708
B-H-I-R-O-T-R-S-T-C-I.

28:01.200 --> 28:05.716
Bullet holes in ridge of tent,
rain starting to come in.

28:06.040 --> 28:07.917
Ten out of ten. Your turn.

28:09.120 --> 28:13.193
I spy, with my little eye
something beginning with.

28:14.280 --> 28:19.400
R-N-H-I-S-O-T-W

28:20.240 --> 28:27.237
G-P-W-B-I-T-F-T-R-O-T-W.

28:28.400 --> 28:29.879
What?

28:30.560 --> 28:33.438
A rather nice hotel I spotted
on the way here.

28:34.120 --> 28:37.430
Get packed, we're booking in there
for the rest of the week.

28:42.000 --> 28:43.880
And I don't want you three
playing silly beggars

28:43.960 --> 28:45.712
running all over the place tonight.

28:46.240 --> 28:48.674
Once you're in bed you stay in bed,
do you hear me?

28:48.840 --> 28:50.193
It's still light.

28:50.400 --> 28:52.152
Never mind "it's still light".

28:52.800 --> 28:54.279
People grow when they're asleep.

28:54.800 --> 28:57.872
If you can't stop in bed you'll end up
a short-ass like your Uncle Sammy.

28:59.520 --> 29:02.512
Go on. You know the rules,
let's see if you can stick to 'em.

29:02.760 --> 29:04.557
- Night, Diane.
- Night.

29:12.080 --> 29:14.992
Evidence would suggest that this man

29:15.080 --> 29:18.550
attacked two women on two nights,
back to back.

29:20.080 --> 29:22.230
One was set upon here.

29:22.720 --> 29:26.952
The exact location of the second attack
is unclear.

29:27.080 --> 29:29.275
We will be patrolling in pairs

29:29.640 --> 29:31.392
from 9:00 p.m. Until dawn.

29:31.680 --> 29:33.910
Dawn? You'd think there was a war on.

29:34.000 --> 29:36.673
There's no cause for levity.

29:37.600 --> 29:40.273
- Ladies' safety is at risk!
- What ladies?

29:42.840 --> 29:44.512
That's nice.

29:59.880 --> 30:02.269
That's my girl. That's it.

30:02.600 --> 30:04.158
That's it.

30:09.920 --> 30:11.638
That's it.

30:12.520 --> 30:14.033
You're doing so well.

30:15.600 --> 30:16.919
Well done.

30:23.280 --> 30:25.350
No noise. There's a good girl.

30:27.040 --> 30:29.190
Bite down. Bite down!

30:49.040 --> 30:50.951
The head's coming.
We've got to get you out.

30:54.440 --> 30:56.476
That's it. Good girl.

31:00.440 --> 31:01.873
You're all right.

31:07.040 --> 31:08.712
What's this programme called again?

31:09.080 --> 31:10.308
<i>Juke Box Jury.</i>

31:11.080 --> 31:13.071
They play their records
to a panel of experts

31:13.160 --> 31:14.376
and then they give their verdict.

31:14.400 --> 31:16.834
And they are often incorrect
in their opinion.

31:17.320 --> 31:19.231
That is why we at Nonnatus House

31:19.360 --> 31:24.354
generally confine ourselves to
<i>Songs of Praise</i> and <i>Panorama.</i>

31:24.440 --> 31:27.113
Ah, it's a very catchy little tune.
Who's singing it?

31:27.480 --> 31:29.914
Pinky and Perky.
You can't see them, but they're pigs.

31:30.240 --> 31:32.674
Although they are not real.

31:33.080 --> 31:34.559
Dr Godfrey!

31:34.960 --> 31:37.315
I have just been flagged down
in the street

31:37.440 --> 31:40.113
by a patient who's been waiting
for a house call from you

31:40.240 --> 31:44.313
since three o' clock this afternoon,
in acute pain!

31:44.480 --> 31:46.391
It's psoriatic arthritis!

31:46.480 --> 31:49.517
- Poor man.
- Woman, as it happens.

31:49.680 --> 31:52.831
And I assured her she would be
your first call tomorrow.

31:53.560 --> 31:56.074
I will be disappointed
if you make a liar of me.

31:56.480 --> 31:59.233
All care will be dispensed
at thy dictates.

32:01.920 --> 32:03.069
Oh!

32:03.320 --> 32:07.552
Give her a robe, a shield and a helmet
and she'd be the double of Britannia.

32:10.800 --> 32:12.358
That's it.

32:14.080 --> 32:15.354
Ah!

32:16.040 --> 32:17.598
The head's out.

32:18.960 --> 32:22.350
When you feel another pain,
you push like hell, do you hear me?

32:32.640 --> 32:36.713
Come on. That's it. That's it!

32:44.520 --> 32:46.875
It's a boy! We've got a boy!

32:47.200 --> 32:48.428
Can I see him?

32:49.400 --> 32:51.550
In a minute,
when I've tied and cut the cord.

32:59.280 --> 33:00.554
Not been called out yet?

33:01.640 --> 33:03.995
I'm positively poised
to spring into action.

33:04.440 --> 33:08.228
Shoes on, Pan Stik applied,
and one ear cocked for the telephone.

33:09.680 --> 33:10.749
Where were you?

33:11.800 --> 33:13.119
In Delia's room.

33:13.760 --> 33:15.360
She was just teaching me
a new card game.

33:26.840 --> 33:28.353
Stay there.

33:29.200 --> 33:31.031
If you feel another pain, you push.

33:31.520 --> 33:32.953
I just want to go to bed.

33:33.080 --> 33:35.389
You can't!
You've got to get rid of the afterbirth!

33:36.120 --> 33:37.758
None of mine took this long.

33:39.160 --> 33:40.559
It's not right.

33:41.320 --> 33:43.038
Stay in here and don't move.

33:43.600 --> 33:46.273
Mum? Don't leave me!

33:52.720 --> 33:54.392
Is that Nonnatus House?

33:54.600 --> 33:56.113
I need to speak to Nurse Franklin.

33:56.200 --> 33:57.997
I'm sure you'd rather talk to a doctor.

33:58.280 --> 33:59.429
<i>The name's Godfrey.</i>

33:59.520 --> 34:02.193
I just delivered a baby and
the afterbirth hasn't come away.

34:02.280 --> 34:03.713
And what is the patient's name?

34:03.920 --> 34:05.433
Hills.

34:06.160 --> 34:07.878
It's been more than an hour and a half.

34:08.080 --> 34:11.914
The placenta can take its time but I
expect you know that from your training.

34:12.159 --> 34:17.074
Employ Brandt-Andrews and, er,
don't forget, good pull on the cord.

34:17.400 --> 34:19.072
- Thank you, Doctor.
- <i>Best of British.</i>

34:21.920 --> 34:23.114
Dr Godfrey!

34:23.280 --> 34:25.350
Apologies for appearing dishabille.

34:25.520 --> 34:29.308
I've heard such enticing things about
the midnight larder at Nonnatus House.

34:29.400 --> 34:30.549
The larder's in the kitchen.

34:32.639 --> 34:34.437
I came down
because I heard the telephone.

34:34.760 --> 34:38.196
One of your colleagues
struggling to deliver a placenta.

34:38.480 --> 34:41.790
She asked for you but I obliged
with procedure advice.

34:41.880 --> 34:42.915
Which colleague?

34:43.440 --> 34:46.431
She didn't give her name.
Said the patient's name was Hills.

35:07.960 --> 35:09.120
I need you back on the floor.

35:10.520 --> 35:11.919
He told me what to do.

35:13.040 --> 35:14.234
Come on.

35:17.640 --> 35:20.234
I'm sorry,
I know you're only second on call,

35:20.440 --> 35:22.795
but something distinctly odd
has happened.

35:26.320 --> 35:28.675
I'm just going to pull on it,
all right?

36:00.120 --> 36:01.473
What's happened?

36:03.680 --> 36:05.796
- What's your name, sweetie?
- It's Diane.

36:05.880 --> 36:07.279
We're here to help, Diane.

36:08.040 --> 36:10.270
- What have I done?
- Baby's well.

36:11.160 --> 36:13.913
Let me examine you and see
what's causing all this pain.

36:16.960 --> 36:18.154
You try an inversion?

36:18.280 --> 36:19.713
I only did what the doctor said.

36:19.800 --> 36:23.588
I only pulled on the cord
because the afterbirth was stuck.

36:23.920 --> 36:25.433
You pulled too hard, Thora.

36:25.760 --> 36:28.672
It isn't just the afterbirth
that's come out. It's Diane's womb.

36:31.200 --> 36:32.394
Oh!

36:32.480 --> 36:34.948
Placenta's still attached
and there's no haemorrhage.

36:38.560 --> 36:41.028
Thora, I want you to sit down
and hold the baby,

36:41.200 --> 36:43.191
while Nurse Franklin helps Diane.

36:45.200 --> 36:47.509
It's all right, Diane.
I'm a midwife.

36:47.640 --> 36:49.153
I'm going to call an ambulance.

36:59.480 --> 37:00.629
Sister.

37:02.080 --> 37:03.593
What are you doing out on your own?

37:04.000 --> 37:06.514
I have to use the telephone.
It's an emergency.

37:06.920 --> 37:09.798
Come on.
You can have an escort there and back.

37:10.040 --> 37:11.598
Make believe you're the Queen.

37:16.400 --> 37:18.038
Help me.

37:19.000 --> 37:21.389
- Please help me.
- Hold my hand.

37:23.600 --> 37:24.919
Can you feel how steady it is?

37:25.200 --> 37:26.713
- Mmm-hmm.
- I'm not shaking,

37:27.240 --> 37:28.840
and that's because
I know what I'm doing.

37:29.280 --> 37:30.429
You're quite safe.

37:31.040 --> 37:33.838
Flying Squad will take half an hour
to get here.

37:34.840 --> 37:36.068
That's all right.

37:36.800 --> 37:38.677
We can manage splendidly on our own.

37:39.200 --> 37:40.394
Can't we?

37:40.920 --> 37:42.194
Yes, we can.

37:42.640 --> 37:44.198
It's all right, Diane.

37:44.560 --> 37:46.710
Nurse Franklin's going
to set things to right.

37:47.680 --> 37:49.280
You won't be uncomfortable for too long.

37:49.800 --> 37:51.870
- Ah!
- Stay strong, sweetie.

37:52.120 --> 37:53.120
And stay still.

37:54.160 --> 37:55.878
I'm sorry, sweetheart.

37:56.560 --> 37:58.676
You're being so brave, Diane.

37:59.360 --> 38:01.590
I know you can be brave
for a few moments longer.

38:02.120 --> 38:03.872
I thought I could do it
on my own.

38:05.320 --> 38:07.197
I thought I didn't need no one else.

38:10.400 --> 38:12.072
It's back in place.

38:22.720 --> 38:24.312
I'll follow them to Admissions.

38:24.880 --> 38:27.519
Unfortunately, we can't trust Thora
to tell the truth.

38:28.360 --> 38:30.078
It might affect Diane's treatment.

38:31.000 --> 38:33.355
I'll find a neighbour
to look in on the boys.

38:33.680 --> 38:36.752
But I'll clean the kitchen first.
I don't want anyone seeing that mess.

38:38.960 --> 38:40.359
There's so much to hide.

38:46.280 --> 38:48.430
- Mmm.
- Shelagh.

38:51.360 --> 38:53.715
So much for getting back to nature.

38:54.280 --> 38:57.511
There are flowers on the table
and feathers in these pillows.

38:58.440 --> 39:00.954
That is all the nature I need
to get back to.

39:02.960 --> 39:06.748
The children haven't come knocking.
Do you suppose they're sleeping well?

39:07.480 --> 39:10.392
Either that, or they've been
mauled to death by squirrels.

39:18.280 --> 39:19.872
- Shelagh...
- Mmm?

39:20.680 --> 39:23.592
- I want to call the surgery.
- Why?

39:24.200 --> 39:26.634
Because it will put my mind at rest.

39:27.600 --> 39:30.353
And then we'll really be able
to enjoy our holiday.

39:30.480 --> 39:32.755
Instead of pretending.

39:57.320 --> 39:58.958
Diane's gone into theatre now.

39:59.880 --> 40:02.713
The ward sister suggested you go home
and telephone later.

40:04.000 --> 40:05.228
Am I gonna lose her?

40:05.880 --> 40:07.393
No, you aren't.

40:09.120 --> 40:11.076
All I could think about
was her reputation.

40:12.640 --> 40:15.473
I had to get married
when she was on the way.

40:16.320 --> 40:18.038
No white wedding for me, it was

40:18.120 --> 40:20.031
straight down the registry
in a plum two-piece

40:20.120 --> 40:21.553
I borrowed off of my cousin.

40:21.920 --> 40:24.718
One day, Diane will find a man
that's worthy of her.

40:25.640 --> 40:29.428
And I, for one, will be outside that
church watching you flinging confetti.

40:32.040 --> 40:35.191
I put a flannel in her mouth
to stop her from screaming.

40:36.920 --> 40:38.319
I never even let her hold him.

40:40.400 --> 40:43.631
I'm not cruel by nature,
but I don't know which is worse.

40:45.320 --> 40:48.073
I think it's time that you put all that
behind you now, Thora.

40:49.240 --> 40:50.559
Make a fresh start.

40:51.680 --> 40:53.360
It won't be a fresh start, though,
will it?

40:53.920 --> 40:55.751
Not if I keep on keeping secrets.

41:37.120 --> 41:39.953
No! No! No! Ah!

41:52.800 --> 41:54.472
Ah, hello, Operator,

41:54.680 --> 41:58.036
I'd like to be connected to a number
in Poplar, London, please.

43:02.480 --> 43:03.879
A uterine inversion?

43:04.360 --> 43:05.839
Yes, at a home delivery.

43:05.960 --> 43:08.520
I should never have come away.

43:11.120 --> 43:12.314
We're going home.

43:21.080 --> 43:22.399
Please, don't touch me.

43:33.320 --> 43:36.392
Oh, Sister, what were you
thinking of, cycling alone?

43:39.080 --> 43:41.640
You always do. I thought...

43:42.920 --> 43:45.434
I thought my habit would protect me,
but that was my arrogance.

43:45.960 --> 43:47.279
It's my fault.

43:47.560 --> 43:49.630
You are not to even say
the word "fault".

43:50.000 --> 43:52.070
Do you hear me? I won't allow it.

43:53.560 --> 43:55.471
Sister, what happened?

44:00.200 --> 44:01.838
I wasn't raped.

44:03.360 --> 44:05.874
Before you ask me, I can say that,
I wasn't raped.

44:06.080 --> 44:10.073
Oh, you were viciously attacked.
Just now, the details don't matter.

44:10.160 --> 44:11.878
I don't want you to come near me.
I just...

44:13.400 --> 44:15.072
I don't want anybody to touch me at all.

44:18.000 --> 44:19.592
I'll call Sergeant Noakes.

44:35.120 --> 44:36.758
Do you know the worst thing?

44:38.200 --> 44:39.599
No.

44:42.760 --> 44:44.751
I don't know, and...

44:46.400 --> 44:47.719
I can't imagine it.

44:47.840 --> 44:50.274
The worst thing is that
I'd actually stopped to pray.

44:52.200 --> 44:53.918
I'd stopped

44:55.400 --> 44:58.073
because I wanted to raise my prayers
with yours.

45:00.680 --> 45:04.593
To sing inside my soul
what my sisters were singing.

45:07.240 --> 45:09.470
I wanted to give thanks
for Trixie's skill.

45:10.480 --> 45:12.835
For what she had done,
for the fact Diane had survived.

45:16.600 --> 45:21.469
And it was one of the most
beautiful moments I'd ever known.

45:23.120 --> 45:25.873
I felt so close to God,
and then it happened.

45:27.840 --> 45:32.550
Sister, would it help you to pray now?

45:35.440 --> 45:37.271
- Pray now?
- Yes.

45:38.160 --> 45:39.752
No.

45:41.280 --> 45:43.635
Sergeant Noakes wants to interview you.

45:45.400 --> 45:47.311
And you will have to be examined
by a doctor.

45:47.400 --> 45:49.630
No, I can't. Don't make me.

45:51.640 --> 45:55.599
If no one speaks out,
this is going to go on happening

45:56.520 --> 45:58.909
- and happening...
- All I can think about now is

45:59.080 --> 46:02.993
what happened this morning when
I thought God was at my shoulder

46:03.440 --> 46:05.635
and there was someone else behind me
all the time.

46:05.800 --> 46:07.631
- Sister...
- Don't talk to me gently!

46:07.720 --> 46:11.349
Don't be kind! Because I'm angry!

46:13.960 --> 46:18.556
I'm angry and I don't know what to do
or what God wants of me.

46:18.640 --> 46:21.200
I don't even know
if He wants anything at all.

46:23.080 --> 46:27.153
Sister, just let me
hold you by the hand.

46:27.240 --> 46:29.037
I wouldn't be able to feel it.

46:31.520 --> 46:36.674
It's as if I'm behind glass
or he's behind glass.

46:40.040 --> 46:42.349
I'm scared to move
in case everything breaks.

46:46.560 --> 46:48.835
- Can I speak to her?
- She doesn't want to.

46:48.920 --> 46:51.593
And I cannot
and I will not force her to.

46:51.680 --> 46:55.912
- She's been brutalised enough.
- Sister, someone has to talk to us.

46:57.000 --> 46:58.718
Or I don't know where it's going to end.

47:00.400 --> 47:01.992
The doctor said he'd be around later.

47:03.400 --> 47:04.958
Sister, you're meant to be resting.

47:05.680 --> 47:07.079
I want to have a bath.

47:07.680 --> 47:10.240
You can't! You have to be examined.

47:10.320 --> 47:12.390
Why? I know what he did, I was there!

47:13.640 --> 47:15.232
If you want a bath, you have one.

47:15.920 --> 47:17.478
But please let us help you.

47:19.320 --> 47:20.594
Just don't lock the door.

47:20.920 --> 47:22.560
You were knocked unconscious
this morning.

47:24.040 --> 47:25.678
Please don't lock the door.

47:31.280 --> 47:36.957
Judith, after years and years
of caring for mothers and babies,

47:38.320 --> 47:41.596
I found that all pain passes in the end.

47:41.680 --> 47:43.557
I know that. I do know that.

47:43.920 --> 47:48.835
Sometimes it won't take its leave
until we acknowledge that it's there.

47:49.200 --> 47:50.633
Or why it's there.

47:50.720 --> 47:53.439
I don't want to talk to anybody.

47:53.600 --> 47:55.591
You thought it could have been Colin.

47:55.760 --> 47:57.910
The police could have thought
I was on the game.

47:58.000 --> 47:59.877
Out at night coming home
with bite marks?

48:00.000 --> 48:01.513
But we know the truth, Judith.

48:01.600 --> 48:02.999
Not all of it.

48:04.920 --> 48:08.276
I'm a bad mother, Sister,
and I was punished.

48:09.800 --> 48:11.119
Can Colin come in?

48:57.880 --> 49:00.519
<i>Babies cry.
Everybody knows babies cry.</i>

49:01.720 --> 49:05.030
But when it's yours,
you can't ignore it.

49:05.560 --> 49:06.913
Ignoring's not allowed.

49:07.680 --> 49:09.477
It isn't even possible.

49:12.200 --> 49:13.713
So I thought I'd

49:14.720 --> 49:16.153
try the walking at night.

49:16.440 --> 49:18.112
You always give good advice.

49:18.960 --> 49:20.712
It didn't make any difference.

49:22.520 --> 49:25.114
And the crying gets inside your head.

49:26.480 --> 49:32.191
And in the end, you can't tell if
it's him screaming or you screaming.

49:33.520 --> 49:35.192
- And...
- Love.

49:36.160 --> 49:37.559
It's all right.

49:38.960 --> 49:42.032
And so I parked the pram

49:43.400 --> 49:44.674
and I walked away.

49:46.840 --> 49:48.068
I walked away!

49:49.520 --> 49:51.431
I abandoned my baby.

49:54.240 --> 49:58.438
All I wanted was to not hear
that crying any more.

50:00.320 --> 50:01.719
And then I felt...

50:03.120 --> 50:05.076
He grabbed me from behind.

50:05.280 --> 50:06.280
The man who hurt you.

50:06.560 --> 50:08.073
I'm sorry.

50:08.640 --> 50:12.235
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry. I should have known.

50:13.200 --> 50:14.599
I should have helped you.

50:14.680 --> 50:16.113
I couldn't tell you.

50:16.320 --> 50:17.878
I wanted to tell you.

50:17.960 --> 50:20.269
But how can I go to the police?

50:20.640 --> 50:23.837
If I tell them the truth,
they'll have social workers on me

50:23.920 --> 50:26.354
saying I'm an unfit mother and I am.

50:26.560 --> 50:27.709
You are not.

50:29.120 --> 50:30.997
And you've done nothing to be
ashamed of.

50:31.120 --> 50:34.874
That's not true, and I'm
not gonna speak to the police.

50:43.160 --> 50:44.593
Thank you.

50:59.440 --> 51:03.718
There is a time for us
to mortify our flesh.

51:07.080 --> 51:12.518
And a time to cherish it,
and marvel at its strength.

51:44.000 --> 51:45.433
I've changed my mind.

51:46.960 --> 51:48.951
You want to go to the police?

51:49.640 --> 51:53.679
Other women can't
because they're too afraid.

51:55.160 --> 51:56.559
Afraid they'll get the blame.

51:57.840 --> 51:59.717
Afraid of what other people
will think of them.

52:01.760 --> 52:05.116
And I'm afraid of so many things,
but not that.

52:14.680 --> 52:16.557
He smelled of alcohol.

52:17.480 --> 52:21.234
Not beer, I know what beer smells like,
but it wasn't that.

52:22.040 --> 52:26.431
And he was taller than me
but not as tall as some men.

52:28.560 --> 52:30.118
And when...

52:30.960 --> 52:33.918
When he turned me around to face him,

52:34.200 --> 52:38.318
I saw quite clearly that
he had tattoos on both hands.

52:42.880 --> 52:44.393
<i>Was it working girls
he went for?</i>

52:45.200 --> 52:46.428
<i>He went for defenceless women</i>

52:46.520 --> 52:48.280
<i>who were going about
their ordinary business.</i>

52:50.840 --> 52:51.989
It's prison work.

52:52.600 --> 52:55.831
Soot or ink rubbed into cuts
made with a knife.

52:57.280 --> 52:58.599
I don't know that one.

52:59.600 --> 53:02.672
This one says he's a convicted brigand.

53:03.040 --> 53:05.679
And this one says
what he thinks of his sentence.

53:07.360 --> 53:08.475
I've had more old lags

53:08.560 --> 53:10.680
than you can shake a stick at
come through these doors

53:11.120 --> 53:13.554
- and I've never seen tats like that.
- I have.

53:15.000 --> 53:16.991
You get them on the Soviet lads.

53:17.480 --> 53:19.471
The ones that come in
with the Merchant Marine.

53:19.600 --> 53:20.715
Soviet?

53:20.880 --> 53:25.556
So, what you need to do is look up
what ship's come in under their flag.

53:34.800 --> 53:36.995
I've brought your tetanus jab,
I'm afraid.

53:40.480 --> 53:41.629
How are you feeling?

53:42.720 --> 53:43.835
Lighter.

53:45.880 --> 53:48.678
I thought, at first,
that it was a test of faith,

53:48.960 --> 53:51.190
but it was only a test of strength.

53:52.560 --> 53:55.028
I can bear more
than I ever thought I could,

53:55.120 --> 54:01.275
and I can bear it for others
because my strength is a gift from Him.

54:03.040 --> 54:05.156
I can tell the truth and not be ashamed.

54:07.360 --> 54:10.989
It's like singing. Every voice counts.

54:20.240 --> 54:21.514
Aren't you gonna look at him?

54:22.360 --> 54:23.554
He's beautiful, Diane.

54:24.800 --> 54:26.472
I've already got three little brothers.

54:27.080 --> 54:28.229
He's your son.

54:32.000 --> 54:33.149
I could have killed you.

54:34.480 --> 54:36.789
Because I didn't want you ruined.

54:38.640 --> 54:41.757
Because I'd rather lie all my life,
all your life and his

54:41.840 --> 54:44.149
than tell the world
to take a running jump.

54:46.880 --> 54:48.640
People are gonna wonder
where your bump went.

54:49.280 --> 54:51.157
If they ask me I'll tell them the truth.

55:02.440 --> 55:03.714
Can I hold him?

55:04.640 --> 55:08.474
Don't ask me, just take him.

55:10.080 --> 55:11.479
He's yours.

55:16.520 --> 55:17.999
I'm a mum, Mum.

55:20.400 --> 55:22.391
And I don't even know where to start.

55:23.080 --> 55:24.638
You just did.

55:53.760 --> 55:56.877
<i>And as the summer
inched towards its close,</i>

55:57.280 --> 56:00.033
<i>Dr Turner found a more reliable locum</i>

56:00.160 --> 56:03.072
<i>and the family had a proper holiday
at last.</i>

56:03.280 --> 56:07.353
<i>There was no pretend enjoyment
this time, everything was real.</i>

56:11.680 --> 56:13.033
Oh, art history tonight?

56:14.320 --> 56:15.594
No.

56:17.120 --> 56:18.872
I think it's about time I came clean.

56:20.200 --> 56:23.078
I have no interest whatever
in art history

56:23.760 --> 56:26.513
and I'm actually going to
an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting.

56:27.520 --> 56:31.195
We go every week,
and I've been going for ten months.

56:33.280 --> 56:34.474
Good for you.

56:35.320 --> 56:36.719
I think it's absolutely splendid.

56:37.720 --> 56:38.948
Hmm.

56:39.120 --> 56:41.998
<i>New truths were
being spoken at Nonnatus House,</i>

56:42.400 --> 56:44.038
<i>but some remained concealed...</i>

56:46.320 --> 56:48.515
<i>while one voice rose,</i>

56:48.720 --> 56:51.871
<i>striving to erase its agony in song.</i>

57:00.640 --> 57:05.270
It is been declared to be
100% effective in preventing pregnancy.

57:05.360 --> 57:07.954
<i>It's a miracle with moral implications.</i>

57:08.280 --> 57:10.669
<i>Barge people are a law unto themselves.</i>

57:10.840 --> 57:13.274
<i>There's help
and there's interference.</i>

57:13.400 --> 57:14.576
- Fetch me my clothes.
- Mrs Blacker...

57:14.600 --> 57:15.874
Fetch 'em!

57:16.280 --> 57:18.120
There's been a weather warning
on the wireless.

57:18.200 --> 57:19.997
<i>Gale force nine across London.</i>

57:20.280 --> 57:21.838
<i>Straight out of</i>
Whitaker's Almanack.

57:21.920 --> 57:23.056
We ought to batten down the hatches.

57:23.080 --> 57:24.880
I'm sure there's no need
for us to be alarmed.

57:25.280 --> 57:28.795
Morning, Sister Julienne,
Sister Mary Cynthia.
