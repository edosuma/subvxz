00:51.176 --> 00:54.137
Hi there. I mean, howdy, partner!

00:54.220 --> 00:57.891
Pandy and I have been camping out
in the old Wild West,

00:57.974 --> 01:00.101
so I made us a nice little campfire.

01:00.685 --> 01:02.771
Ah, toasty.

01:02.854 --> 01:05.106
We've been riding the range all day,

01:05.190 --> 01:08.026
so Pandy rustled us up
a little campfire snack.

01:08.568 --> 01:10.070
Marshmallows.

01:11.529 --> 01:13.031
Let's get to toasting.

01:14.199 --> 01:16.409
Have you ever toasted
a marshmallow before?

01:16.951 --> 01:19.954
I like to toast mine
until it's all ooey and gooey inside.

01:20.705 --> 01:22.916
Pandy likes his nice and crispy.

01:24.626 --> 01:29.506
Ooh-ee! You know what that sound means.
It's time for a Dollhouse Delivery!

01:29.589 --> 01:31.800
Come on, Pandy, let's ride.

01:42.435 --> 01:46.940
All right. Let's see what we have
in our Meow Meow Mailbox today.

01:49.651 --> 01:52.153
All right.

01:52.237 --> 01:56.616
Well, I'll be a cowboy's uncle!

01:56.699 --> 01:59.077
Look at that!

01:59.661 --> 02:03.706
It has a cool cowboy hat and a bandana.

02:04.290 --> 02:06.751
It's a little Cowboy Kitty Cat Box.

02:06.835 --> 02:08.253
Let's see what's inside.

02:09.921 --> 02:12.257
It's a bag. See?

02:13.091 --> 02:15.176
Wait, there's something in here.

02:15.260 --> 02:16.678
Yee-haw!

02:16.761 --> 02:20.515
A bag of gold nuggets!

02:20.598 --> 02:22.684
Looks like we struck it rich, Pandy.

02:25.061 --> 02:26.563
Oh, I think there's a note.

02:27.856 --> 02:29.232
It's from…

02:30.066 --> 02:31.109
Kitty Fairy.

02:33.736 --> 02:34.988
Says here,

02:35.655 --> 02:38.158
"Dear Pandy and Gabby,

02:38.241 --> 02:41.035
please hurry
to the Wild West Kitty Fairy Garden

02:41.119 --> 02:42.954
with the bag of gold nuggets,

02:43.037 --> 02:47.000
and be sure to keep it safe
from CatRat the Bandit."

02:47.542 --> 02:49.919
Hmm. CatRat the Bandit?

02:50.920 --> 02:53.006
Oh! Look here!

02:53.089 --> 02:56.092
It's CatRat the Bandit on a wanted poster.

02:57.760 --> 03:01.472
Hmm. Sounds like he's been causing
some trouble in the Dollhouse.

03:01.556 --> 03:04.642
We'd better get in there
and help them out, Pandy.

03:05.935 --> 03:08.062
Time to get tiny.

03:17.822 --> 03:18.990
Whoo-ee!

03:19.532 --> 03:23.202
I'm over here in the Fairy Tail Garden.
Come on in, partner!

03:24.412 --> 03:26.039
Welcome to my Dollhouse.

03:26.831 --> 03:28.207
Whoa!

03:28.750 --> 03:31.044
Check out this train engine!

03:32.211 --> 03:33.212
Ooh!

03:34.213 --> 03:35.882
And all the cactuses!

03:35.965 --> 03:37.926
Oops! I mean "cacti."

03:42.013 --> 03:46.351
Aww! There's even cute little
Dust Bunny tumbleweeds blowing through.

03:46.434 --> 03:48.228
What do you think, Cowboy Pandy?

03:49.562 --> 03:52.023
Pandy? Hmm.

03:52.106 --> 03:56.194
I know that rascal Pandy's
around here somewhere.

03:56.277 --> 03:57.320
Do you see him?

03:59.072 --> 04:02.742
-Cactus hug attack!
-Whoa! Pandy!

04:02.825 --> 04:05.703
I'm glad your cactus hug attack
is soft and cuddly,

04:05.787 --> 04:07.997
not sharp and prickly, like a real cactus.

04:08.081 --> 04:09.624
Sweet saddlebags!

04:11.125 --> 04:13.920
Are we going
on a Wild West train adventure?

04:14.003 --> 04:15.880
I love a good train adventure.

04:15.964 --> 04:18.216
Did someone say "adventure"?

04:20.260 --> 04:22.387
Howdy, Gabby. Howdy, Pandy.

04:22.470 --> 04:24.013
Morning, Kitty Fairy.

04:24.097 --> 04:26.516
I see you got the gold nuggets I sent you.

04:26.599 --> 04:30.228
Yep, and we're keeping them safe
from CatRat the Bandit.

04:30.311 --> 04:31.396
Oh, good!

04:31.479 --> 04:34.399
I just knew you two
were the right cowpokes for the job.

04:34.482 --> 04:35.483
Now, listen here.

04:35.566 --> 04:37.777
I need you to ride this train
to Kitty Town

04:37.860 --> 04:40.655
and safely deliver
these gold nuggets to Baby Box.

04:40.738 --> 04:44.117
Easy-peasy, mac-and-cheesy, ma'am.

04:44.200 --> 04:45.702
Let's ride!

04:45.785 --> 04:47.537
Not so fast.

04:47.620 --> 04:51.416
You'll need to keep a close eye out
for CatRat the Bandit.

04:51.499 --> 04:53.334
He's been causing all kinds of trouble

04:53.418 --> 04:56.087
trying to get his paws
on those shiny gold nuggets.

04:56.170 --> 05:00.049
Well, there's no way
he's getting past these cowpokes.

05:00.133 --> 05:01.134
Right, Gabby?

05:01.968 --> 05:04.262
Does a horse eat from a rancher's hat?

05:05.179 --> 05:06.014
Uh…

05:06.097 --> 05:07.765
The answer is yes.

05:07.849 --> 05:11.602
The horse trusts the rancher,
so he eats from his hat. Get it?

05:11.686 --> 05:12.937
I guess so.

05:13.021 --> 05:14.355
It's cowpoke talk.

05:14.439 --> 05:16.607
Anyway, don't worry, Kitty Fairy.

05:16.691 --> 05:20.403
We'll deliver this gold to Baby Box
safe and sound.

05:23.614 --> 05:25.658
-Bye, Kitty Fairy!
-Good luck!

05:30.121 --> 05:32.081
Meh! Cowpokes.

05:32.165 --> 05:35.418
They can't outsmart old CatRat the Bandit.

05:35.501 --> 05:39.130
Those shiny gold nuggets
are going to be miney.

05:39.213 --> 05:41.841
All miney!

05:41.924 --> 05:44.844
Ooh! Hello, handsome.

05:47.472 --> 05:48.806
A-toodley-do!

05:58.733 --> 06:01.069
Whoo-ee! This is the life.

06:01.152 --> 06:04.238
Just a couple of cowpokes
riding off on an adventure.

06:04.322 --> 06:07.492
You know what would make
this adventure even better?

06:08.201 --> 06:09.535
Something to chew on?

06:09.619 --> 06:11.245
Yeah.

06:11.329 --> 06:12.872
But you know what else?

06:12.955 --> 06:16.167
-A cowpoke song!
-Just let me get my harmonica.

06:46.489 --> 06:48.950
Uh-oh! Looks like we have some company.

06:50.034 --> 06:51.786
CatRat the Bandit!

06:52.453 --> 06:54.872
-Hey!
-He just stole the gold nuggets!

06:54.956 --> 06:59.418
Sorry, cowpokes,
but shiny is miney.

06:59.502 --> 07:00.837
Toodley-do!

07:01.379 --> 07:02.713
He's getting away!

07:02.797 --> 07:04.215
Oh, no, he's not.

07:04.298 --> 07:05.842
Pandy, back it up.

07:10.388 --> 07:14.058
Full speed ahead!
Let's get those gold nuggets back.

07:16.394 --> 07:17.228
Hmm?

07:18.104 --> 07:19.564
Argh!

07:19.647 --> 07:22.233
Don't worry, Pandy. We'll catch him.

07:22.316 --> 07:24.026
I love a good chase.

07:24.110 --> 07:27.155
And you know what always makes a chase
even more fun?

07:27.697 --> 07:29.490
A cowpoke song!

07:55.892 --> 07:56.726
Look!

07:57.435 --> 08:01.063
CatRat's handcar is on the side
of the tracks! Hit the brakes, Pandy.

08:04.775 --> 08:06.360
CatRat's gone!

08:07.069 --> 08:10.615
And he took the bag of gold nuggets
with him! Oh, man!

08:12.408 --> 08:14.994
We'll never catch him now.

08:18.956 --> 08:23.252
Pandy! Does a cowpoke leave their hat
in the dust when the chips are down?

08:23.336 --> 08:26.088
Maybe, if they're really upset?

08:26.172 --> 08:28.883
Never! A cowpoke doesn't give up.

08:28.966 --> 08:33.387
They pick that hat up, dust it off,
and get back to business.

08:34.013 --> 08:35.014
Yeah.

08:35.765 --> 08:37.600
You're right, Cowpoke Gabby.

08:39.644 --> 08:42.980
Let's get back to the business
of finding CatRat the Bandit.

08:43.981 --> 08:44.982
Hey, look.

08:45.858 --> 08:47.485
CatRat's paw prints!

08:47.568 --> 08:49.862
This must be the way into town.

08:49.946 --> 08:50.947
Come on!

08:54.116 --> 08:55.117
Whoa!

08:57.286 --> 08:59.205
It's an old Western town.

08:59.288 --> 09:00.706
This must be Kitty Town.

09:00.790 --> 09:05.586
Yep. And CatRat the Bandit's footprints
lead right up to that music parlor.

09:06.754 --> 09:09.799
-You ready to get those gold nuggets?
-Let's go.

09:16.264 --> 09:18.808
Wow! I like the tunes, fellas.

09:18.891 --> 09:22.687
Anyone got peanut butter?
Because this is my jam.

09:22.770 --> 09:23.938
Whoo!

09:24.021 --> 09:25.356
Yee-haw!

09:27.233 --> 09:28.276
Wahoo!

09:30.820 --> 09:33.072
Howdy, Gabby! Howdy, Pandy!

09:33.155 --> 09:34.865
Welcome to my music parlor,

09:34.949 --> 09:38.077
where the jugs are a-blowin'
and the beats are a-flowin'.

09:38.160 --> 09:39.453
What brings you two in?

09:39.537 --> 09:42.039
We're looking for CatRat the Bandit.

09:42.123 --> 09:43.249
Seen him lately?

09:43.332 --> 09:44.417
Oh, yeah.

09:44.500 --> 09:47.878
Dude wearing a black hat,
carrying a large sack of gold nuggets?

09:47.962 --> 09:51.757
I saw that guy. He was here,
but he left a little while ago.

09:51.841 --> 09:54.468
-Did he say where he was going?
-Not exactly.

09:54.552 --> 09:56.387
He didn't say where he was going,

09:56.470 --> 09:59.765
but he was singing a song
that might give you a clue.

09:59.849 --> 10:01.892
Sing it for us, DJ Catnip.

10:01.976 --> 10:03.352
Hit it, Juggie Bunnies!

10:33.090 --> 10:36.344
Oops! I forgot about that last part.

10:36.427 --> 10:39.013
So, CatRat went to find
a map to the creek.

10:39.096 --> 10:41.265
I think I saw a map shop somewhere.

10:41.349 --> 10:44.226
Yeah, Pillow Cat has a map shop
right across the road.

10:44.310 --> 10:47.521
She's got all kinds of maps.
He probably went there.

10:47.605 --> 10:48.898
Thanks, DJ Catnip.

10:48.981 --> 10:50.441
Good luck, cowpokes.

10:55.905 --> 10:59.116
Hmm. Where's Pillow Cat?
I don't see her anywhere.

11:02.620 --> 11:03.621
Found her!

11:03.704 --> 11:05.289
Oh, Pillow Cat?

11:06.874 --> 11:08.793
Oh! Howdy, folks!

11:08.876 --> 11:10.795
Was I catnapping again?

11:10.878 --> 11:13.506
Welcome to my map store!

11:14.507 --> 11:17.343
What can I do for you?
I've got maps of all kinds.

11:17.426 --> 11:20.596
Big maps, small maps,
maps of the East, maps of the West,

11:20.679 --> 11:23.224
maps for any type of quest.

11:23.307 --> 11:24.934
We need a map to the creek.

11:25.017 --> 11:28.521
Jumping jackrabbit!
I just sold my last one to…

11:29.355 --> 11:30.439
This guy?

11:31.023 --> 11:32.024
That guy!

11:32.108 --> 11:35.903
What are we gonna do?
We'll never find the creek without a map.

11:35.986 --> 11:38.948
Well, he was singing
a strange song as he left.

11:39.031 --> 11:42.451
-Maybe that will give you a clue?
-Could you sing it for us, Pillow Cat?

11:42.535 --> 11:45.079
Ahem! I'll do my best.

12:14.942 --> 12:17.778
Oh! Forgot about that last part.

12:17.862 --> 12:19.238
It's OK, Pillow Cat.

12:19.321 --> 12:22.825
CatRat the Bandit stole
that big bag of gold nuggets,

12:22.908 --> 12:24.535
and we're trying to get it back.

12:24.618 --> 12:25.453
Yeah!

12:25.536 --> 12:28.122
And thanks to you,
we know he ripped up the map

12:28.205 --> 12:30.124
and hid it in a hollow tree stump.

12:30.207 --> 12:32.084
We just need to find that stump.

12:32.168 --> 12:33.627
Oh, well… Phew!

12:33.711 --> 12:35.963
In that case, I'm glad I could help.

12:36.046 --> 12:38.048
-Bye, Pillow Cat.
-Good luck!

12:39.592 --> 12:41.260
OK. Help us look.

12:41.844 --> 12:43.596
Tell me if you see a tree stump.

12:46.265 --> 12:47.516
You found it!

12:50.519 --> 12:51.520
I've got them!

12:52.897 --> 12:54.440
We've got the pieces.

12:54.523 --> 12:57.276
Now we just need
to put them together, like a puzzle.

12:57.359 --> 13:00.112
This piece looks like a top corner.

13:00.196 --> 13:03.115
And this piece looks like it goes here.

13:03.199 --> 13:05.993
Oh, oh! This piece definitely goes here.

13:06.076 --> 13:09.455
And this one looks like
it fits here at the bottom.

13:09.538 --> 13:11.165
Where does this piece go?

13:14.335 --> 13:16.337
Right here! Thanks.

13:16.420 --> 13:21.050
-And the last piece fits right here.
-We did it!

13:21.133 --> 13:25.429
Now we can follow this map to the creek
and find where CatRat hid the gold.

13:30.476 --> 13:33.979
Cowboy Pandy, fastest taper in the West.

13:34.063 --> 13:37.942
You know it! Now, let's get to that creek
and find those gold nuggets.

13:38.567 --> 13:41.070
You heading to the creek?

13:41.153 --> 13:44.281
Yes, ma'am,
and we need to get there lickety-split.

13:44.365 --> 13:48.494
Well, if you want to get there fast,
you're gonna need some horses.

13:48.577 --> 13:51.163
Horses? Where are we gonna find horses?

13:51.705 --> 13:54.458
Just head on over
to Baby Box's blacksmith shoppe.

13:54.542 --> 13:57.044
She's got the fastest horses in town.

13:57.127 --> 13:59.380
Thanks, Dust Bunny. Let's go.

13:59.463 --> 14:01.257
Happy travels!

14:03.676 --> 14:05.886
Howdy, Gabby! Howdy, Pandy!

14:05.970 --> 14:08.347
Did you guys bring my gold nuggets?

14:08.430 --> 14:11.642
Um… Well, here's the thing, Baby Box.

14:11.725 --> 14:14.395
We don't have the gold nuggets… yet!

14:14.478 --> 14:17.606
CatRat the Bandit stole the gold
right off of our train.

14:18.649 --> 14:21.860
But Gabby and I are hot on his heels.
That's why we're here.

14:21.944 --> 14:24.864
And we need
the two fastest horses you've got.

14:24.947 --> 14:28.826
Well, lucky for you,
I have the two fastest horses in the West.

14:28.909 --> 14:31.036
Just head around back and help yourself.

14:31.120 --> 14:34.707
The fastest horses
are the black and brown speckled ones

14:34.790 --> 14:36.458
with red and gold manes.

14:36.542 --> 14:38.002
Thanks, Baby Box.

14:41.505 --> 14:43.924
Whoa-ho-ho! Hey, there, big fellas.

14:44.008 --> 14:47.761
Baby Box said her fastest horses
were black and brown speckled

14:47.845 --> 14:49.346
with red and gold manes.

14:49.430 --> 14:50.431
Help us find them.

14:50.514 --> 14:54.977
Which horses are black and brown speckled
with red and gold manes?

14:59.231 --> 15:00.232
There they are!

15:02.109 --> 15:05.029
OK, Pandy,
you've got the map so lead the way.

15:08.282 --> 15:11.160
This way to the gold! Wahoo!

15:36.310 --> 15:39.688
You hear that?
The creek must be just up ahead.

15:39.772 --> 15:41.148
-Let's go.

15:46.445 --> 15:50.282
Ha! Those cowpokes
will never find my gold now.

15:50.366 --> 15:52.785
A shiny is miney.

15:52.868 --> 15:55.829
Phew! Now that that's done,
I could really go for a nap.

15:55.913 --> 15:58.374
Back to town, big fella. Giddy-up!

15:58.457 --> 16:01.585
Ooh! Whoa! Ah! Easy, boy! Easy! Whoa!

16:03.879 --> 16:06.298
Ooh, look!

16:10.052 --> 16:11.053
Empty.

16:11.804 --> 16:14.431
Golden glints!

16:15.349 --> 16:19.186
-CatRat hid the gold underwater.
-And I know just how to get it out.

16:19.895 --> 16:20.896
Ta-da!

16:20.980 --> 16:22.940
-A spaghetti strainer?
-Yep.

16:23.023 --> 16:26.151
You never know
when you might want some tasty spaghetti,

16:26.235 --> 16:28.112
or need to pan gold from the river.

16:28.195 --> 16:29.029
Good point.

16:29.113 --> 16:30.823
I'm going in!

16:35.452 --> 16:36.829
Did we get any gold?

16:40.457 --> 16:42.376
Yes! We did it!

16:42.459 --> 16:44.003
We got the gold nuggets!

16:44.086 --> 16:45.254
Wahoo!

16:45.796 --> 16:49.550
Let's get back to town
and deliver these nuggets to Baby Box.

16:51.802 --> 16:53.679
-Giddy-up!

16:58.267 --> 17:00.602
-Yee-haw!
-Whoa-ho-ho!

17:00.686 --> 17:01.729
Good fella!

17:02.479 --> 17:05.315
Hey, Kitty Town!
The cowpokes have returned.

17:05.399 --> 17:07.109
Yay!

17:07.693 --> 17:08.944
-Yeah!
-Yay!

17:09.028 --> 17:12.865
-And we got the gold!

17:12.948 --> 17:14.283
Wahoo!

17:15.576 --> 17:17.911
-Uh, what?

17:18.495 --> 17:19.580
Uh-oh.

17:21.373 --> 17:23.500
I feel a showdown coming on.

17:23.584 --> 17:24.960
Uh-oh!

17:32.760 --> 17:35.304
This here gold belongs to Baby Box.

17:36.764 --> 17:39.349
And we're fixing to make that delivery.

17:39.433 --> 17:41.894
We'll just see about that.

17:44.313 --> 17:46.607
Baby Box, catch!

17:49.651 --> 17:51.528
Got it!

17:54.114 --> 17:56.700
Ooh!

17:56.784 --> 17:58.410
Come on!

17:59.036 --> 18:00.871
Oh, rats!

18:01.747 --> 18:04.833
Baby Box! That catch was incredible!

18:04.917 --> 18:08.003
Thanks! But you guys are the real heroes.

18:08.087 --> 18:11.548
You got my gold nuggets back
from CatRat the Bandit.

18:11.632 --> 18:13.300
And for that…

18:18.931 --> 18:21.433
Don't peek. It's a surprise.

18:32.653 --> 18:34.363
-Ta-da!

18:34.446 --> 18:35.739
A golden badge…

18:36.949 --> 18:38.283
for Sheriff Gabby…

18:39.701 --> 18:40.994
and Sheriff Pandy.

18:41.078 --> 18:43.747
-Yeah!
-You guys were amazing.

18:45.916 --> 18:49.586
And I even got something
for CatRat the Bandit.

18:51.046 --> 18:53.257
For me?

18:54.174 --> 18:55.634
Yep!

18:55.717 --> 18:58.720
For being the best bad guy
in the Wild West.

19:00.556 --> 19:02.850
I made it extra shiny for you.

19:02.933 --> 19:04.852
You know me so well.

19:05.644 --> 19:10.357
CatRat, you are the rootinest-tootinest
bandit I've ever met.

19:10.440 --> 19:12.693
Aww! Shucks.

19:12.776 --> 19:16.613
Who's up for a little jug band music?

19:26.290 --> 19:28.542
-Yee-haw! Wahoo!

19:28.625 --> 19:30.669
-Yee-haw!
-Whoo-ee!

19:31.712 --> 19:34.673
Thanks for having
a rootin'-tootin' day with us.

19:34.756 --> 19:36.800
Are you ready for another surprise?

19:52.316 --> 19:53.859
Oh, hi. It's me.

22:20.213 --> 22:21.965
Laughing and hugging,

22:22.049 --> 22:24.384
two of my favorite things
to do with Pandy.

22:24.468 --> 22:25.469
Pandy Paw Bump?

22:26.553 --> 22:28.263
Pshew!

22:28.347 --> 22:31.975
That was a mighty good one, partner.
"Darn tootin' it was!"

22:33.060 --> 22:36.229
Thanks for coming on our Wild West
adventure in the Dollhouse today.

22:36.313 --> 22:39.399
Come back next time and we'll open up
another Dollhouse Surprise.

22:39.983 --> 22:40.817
See ya.
