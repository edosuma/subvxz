00:02.003 --> 00:03.493
[narrator] Previously on Lost:

00:06.580 --> 00:06.674
[Ben] Two days after I found out
I had a fatal tumor on my spine,

00:06.674 --> 00:08.665
a spinal surgeon fell out of the sky.

00:08.759 --> 00:11.501
We had such a wonderful plan
to break you, Jack.

00:11.596 --> 00:14.303
My wonderful plan
got shot to sunshine

00:14.390 --> 00:17.177
when you saw my damned X-rays
and figured out l was dying.

00:17.268 --> 00:19.304
You want me to save your life.

00:19.395 --> 00:21.761
I want you to want to save my life.

00:22.899 --> 00:24.855
All I can ask is that
you think about it.

00:28.613 --> 00:31.901
[J‘ Ann-Margret: Slowly]

01:14.158 --> 01:17.616
- [knocking]
- [man] Police. Open the door.

01:17.703 --> 01:21.992
Uh... Everything's all right in here.

01:22.083 --> 01:25.246
[man] We have reason to believe
someone dangerous is in the motel.

01:25.336 --> 01:27.497
We're conducting
a room-to-room search.

01:27.588 --> 01:28.998
I'm alone, officer.

01:29.090 --> 01:32.253
[man] He could be holding you
at gunpoint, forcing you to say that.

01:32.343 --> 01:34.629
- Please open the door.
- I don't think I should.

01:34.720 --> 01:38.133
[man] Ma'am, you have three seconds
before I break this door down.

01:38.224 --> 01:40.840
One... two...

01:43.854 --> 01:45.469
Hey.

01:45.898 --> 01:47.889
Wanna get it on?

01:47.984 --> 01:49.565
[chuckles]

01:49.652 --> 01:51.108
Hell, yeah.

01:55.825 --> 01:58.487
- [clanging]
- [machine buzzes] Warning.

02:01.706 --> 02:03.947
- [clanging]
- [machine buzzes] Warning.

02:06.669 --> 02:08.284
Hey.

02:10.047 --> 02:11.708
Hey yourself.

02:12.341 --> 02:15.799
- [machine buzzes] Warning.
- Whatcha doing?

02:17.054 --> 02:18.430
Throwing rocks.

02:19.223 --> 02:20.724
Warning.

02:21.559 --> 02:25.723
- I thought you had to pull the lever.
- I know how to get a damn fish biscuit.

02:26.605 --> 02:28.516
Then get me one.

02:29.692 --> 02:32.354
What, you trying to keep me
feeling productive?

02:34.697 --> 02:36.779
- [clanging]
- [machine buzzes]

02:55.051 --> 02:58.418
You took these blood tests
and made all the notations?

03:00.014 --> 03:03.302
- How old are the X-rays?
- A week.

03:05.269 --> 03:07.931
The tumor on your spine
is borderline inoperable.

03:08.022 --> 03:11.810
At the rate it's growing,
that borderline goes away in about...

03:11.901 --> 03:13.766
...one week.

03:15.446 --> 03:16.606
Oh.

03:23.287 --> 03:25.699
The OR. we were in,
is that fully equipped?

03:25.790 --> 03:27.030
Yes.

03:27.124 --> 03:30.457
- Anesthesia? Sterile?
- Yes.

03:35.091 --> 03:37.332
You need to be in surgery yesterday.

03:43.182 --> 03:44.797
All right, then.

03:45.768 --> 03:48.225
Whatever you need, it's yours.
I'm ready.

03:49.855 --> 03:51.595
No, I think you misunderstood me.

03:53.067 --> 03:54.898
I didn't say l was gonna do it.

03:54.985 --> 03:58.318
| just wanted you to understand
how you're gonna die.

04:02.493 --> 04:04.575
You think I believe you people?

04:04.662 --> 04:07.779
You think I trust you?
That I'm gonna just do the surgery

04:07.873 --> 04:09.989
and hope that you let me go?

04:10.084 --> 04:12.826
- Jack...
- No, don't!

04:24.807 --> 04:28.800
Well, Jack, I'm very disappointed
in your decision.

04:33.274 --> 04:35.356
Well, Ben...

04:35.443 --> 04:38.526
...at least you won't have to
be disappointed for very long.

05:05.389 --> 05:07.755
You shouldn't have come here.

05:09.685 --> 05:11.516
Yeah. You're right.

05:12.396 --> 05:15.763
I've made a huge mistake.
I am just full of regret right now.

05:15.858 --> 05:17.894
Seriously!

05:18.152 --> 05:21.110
It's bad luck to see the bride
before the wedding.

05:21.989 --> 05:26.028
It's bad luck to see the bride
in her dress before the wedding.

05:26.118 --> 05:27.949
You, my friend, are naked.

05:28.037 --> 05:29.698
[chuckles]

05:31.874 --> 05:33.284
Have you tried it on?

05:33.584 --> 05:38.078
l have to hold my breath to get
the claspy things to clasp, so...

05:39.173 --> 05:41.004
I'm waiting till the last minute.

05:41.091 --> 05:44.424
Well, that's in about 12 hours,
you might wanna get clasping.

05:52.269 --> 05:53.805
Hey.

05:56.273 --> 05:57.774
I know it's...

05:59.443 --> 06:01.183
It's been fast.

06:01.820 --> 06:04.357
But this is right.

06:06.700 --> 06:08.611
I know it's real.

06:11.497 --> 06:13.408
And I love you, Monica.

06:15.543 --> 06:17.784
I love you too, Kevin.

06:32.184 --> 06:35.176
Come on. Time for work.

06:39.567 --> 06:42.479
- What about him?
- Oh, he's got the day off.

06:43.779 --> 06:46.236
- If he's not working, neither am |.
- You're not?

06:46.323 --> 06:47.654
Just go, Freckles.

06:48.534 --> 06:52.777
Man wants to give me a day off,
let him give me a day off.

06:52.871 --> 06:55.533
No, Sawyer. We're a team.

06:55.624 --> 06:57.205
You break the rocks. I haul 'em.

06:58.877 --> 07:01.334
All right. Fine.

07:12.391 --> 07:15.508
Lord knows I wouldn't
wanna break up the team.

07:41.920 --> 07:43.876
What happened to him?

07:44.506 --> 07:47.293
Must've been an animal.
Maybe one of the bears.

07:47.384 --> 07:50.000
- Are we gonna carry him back?
- No.

07:50.721 --> 07:52.712
We're gonna bury him here.

07:53.891 --> 07:56.177
- Are we?
- The people back at camp...

07:56.518 --> 07:59.134
There's just been a few
too many funerals lately.

08:01.565 --> 08:03.806
l'll slip back to the beach
and get shovels.

08:03.901 --> 08:05.562
- I'll come.
- No, I'll be back...

08:05.653 --> 08:07.735
It's not safe to go alone, John.

08:12.409 --> 08:14.320
I appreciate your concern.

08:24.922 --> 08:26.913
So, what killed Eko?

08:29.760 --> 08:32.593
Folks back at the beach
call it the monster.

08:32.971 --> 08:34.927
I don't really have a name for it.

08:36.433 --> 08:40.017
- You don't believe in monsters.
- I believe in what I can see.

08:41.980 --> 08:44.266
But obviously, you have.

08:45.984 --> 08:49.602
- Tell me what you think it is.
- Might be what brought us here.

08:49.697 --> 08:52.985
So you believe this monster
decided that Eko was meant to die?

08:53.075 --> 08:56.112
I believe Eko died for a reason.

08:56.203 --> 08:58.569
| just don't know what it is yet.

08:59.456 --> 09:00.707
Is that why you lied?

09:02.292 --> 09:04.874
We're not headed back
towards the camp, are we?

09:06.588 --> 09:07.964
Sure, we are.

09:08.048 --> 09:10.460
Just need to take a little detour first.

09:21.019 --> 09:24.056
- [over P.A.] Compound breach.
- [man] Someone's on the grid.

09:24.148 --> 09:28.061
Where is she? Someone's on the grid.
I want him on the ground. Her too.

09:28.152 --> 09:29.892
If he moves, you shoot him.

09:31.947 --> 09:34.814
Yeah. They're here.
Did the doctor get out again?

09:35.409 --> 09:37.115
You sure?

09:37.202 --> 09:38.863
Well, does he know?

09:38.954 --> 09:41.570
- How the hell did she get over here?
- [grunts]

09:44.334 --> 09:47.826
' Get UP! Come on, get up! Go!
- [Pickett] Alex! Alex!

09:48.338 --> 09:51.250
- What do you think you're doing?
- You gonna shoot me?

09:51.341 --> 09:53.753
You're not supposed to be here.
Just calm...

09:53.844 --> 09:56.711
What did you do to him, Danny?
Where is he?

09:57.514 --> 10:02.304
- I want to talk to Ben.
- Sure. That sounds like a great idea.

10:02.394 --> 10:05.761
- Why don't we lower the slingshot...
- Where is he? Tell me!

10:07.191 --> 10:09.728
- Get off of me!
- Get her out of here.

10:10.027 --> 10:11.016
Get her out of here!

10:11.111 --> 10:14.945
Put me down! Listen,
whatever they say, don't believe them,

10:15.032 --> 10:19.025
they're gonna kill your boyfriend!
Just like they killed mine!

10:39.681 --> 10:42.263
I don't understand.
It's supposed to be two weeks.

10:42.351 --> 10:45.093
- Our schedule moved up.
- Is that an order?

10:45.187 --> 10:49.396
- That's stupid.
- It's not my call. It's the way it is.

10:54.238 --> 10:57.446
I would like for you to put this on
and come with me, please.

10:59.451 --> 11:01.737
You think I'll do it
because you said please?

11:01.829 --> 11:06.118
No, you'll put a hood over your head
because the man standing behind me,

11:06.208 --> 11:08.824
the one who's burning a hole in my back,

11:09.336 --> 11:12.169
that man is going to kill Sawyer.

11:12.256 --> 11:14.668
But if you put this on
and you come with me,

11:14.758 --> 11:17.750
there's something you can
do for us that will save his life.

11:58.594 --> 12:00.926
[knocking]

12:01.013 --> 12:02.503
Come in.

12:05.684 --> 12:08.767
Oh, sweetheart, you're beautiful.

12:11.148 --> 12:13.264
Absolutely beautiful.

12:15.485 --> 12:18.613
- How is it out there?
- There are a lot of excited policemen.

12:20.407 --> 12:24.116
I've asked them not to shoot their guns
in the air when you say "I do."

12:25.996 --> 12:29.363
You know, mothers-in-law
aren't supposed to be so nice.

12:30.334 --> 12:32.746
Um... [clears throat]

12:32.836 --> 12:36.169
...Monica, l have something for you.

12:39.593 --> 12:41.254
Suzanne, you shouldn't have.

12:41.345 --> 12:44.007
My mother gave that to me
on my wedding day.

12:45.599 --> 12:48.591
She told me someday
I'd give it to my daughter,

12:48.685 --> 12:51.848
but... since I had four boys...

12:54.024 --> 12:55.685
Here.

13:12.250 --> 13:14.206
It's perfect.

13:16.213 --> 13:19.501
Kevin's been coming to the church
since he was about yea high.

13:20.884 --> 13:22.624
When I first met you, Monica,

13:22.719 --> 13:27.304
l was struck by your honesty
and your devotion to Kevin.

13:27.391 --> 13:30.178
When I asked him what
he loved most about you, he said,

13:30.519 --> 13:32.726
"Because what you see
is what you get."

13:33.522 --> 13:35.387
With that being said,

13:35.482 --> 13:38.849
you've got the rings,
you've vowed your vows...

13:39.903 --> 13:43.145
...and | now pronounce you
husband and wife.

13:44.908 --> 13:47.615
[Wedding March plays]

13:47.703 --> 13:51.161
[applause]

14:06.013 --> 14:07.503
Thanks, Mom.

14:28.160 --> 14:29.775
[Juliet] Step.

15:08.909 --> 15:11.025
I'll give you two some privacy.

15:17.667 --> 15:20.704
Hey. You OK?

15:22.172 --> 15:24.413
Yeah. You?

15:26.134 --> 15:28.841
Yeah, I'm... l'm great.

15:31.598 --> 15:33.463
Where are they keeping you?

15:34.726 --> 15:37.217
Outside. In a cage.

15:40.107 --> 15:42.769
- Sawyer?
- He's in a cage too.

15:45.654 --> 15:48.020
They're making us work.

15:48.115 --> 15:50.071
Work? On what?

15:50.367 --> 15:52.983
I don't know what it is, but it's big.

15:57.499 --> 16:00.366
- We're hauling rocks, and...
- Hey...

16:02.170 --> 16:03.376
...did they hurt you?

16:09.219 --> 16:10.880
Kate, hey.

16:11.847 --> 16:14.213
Hey, it's gonna be all right.

16:14.724 --> 16:16.385
It's gonna...

16:17.227 --> 16:19.138
Jack.

16:19.229 --> 16:22.312
- You have to do it.
- What?

16:22.399 --> 16:25.607
This thing that they told you to do,
this operation.

16:28.488 --> 16:31.855
- She said, if you do it, they would...
- What'd they do to you?

16:31.950 --> 16:33.815
- What did they do to you?
- Nothing.

16:33.910 --> 16:36.447
How did they get you to ask me?
What did they offer?

16:36.538 --> 16:38.244
- Nothing.
- Then why are you here?

16:38.331 --> 16:41.243
They're gonna kill Sawyer.

16:45.255 --> 16:47.416
[crying] God, I'm sorry.

16:50.927 --> 16:55.796
I'm so sorry, but she said that if you
do it and do it soon, they'll let us go.

16:56.892 --> 16:59.429
And you believe them?

17:02.272 --> 17:03.933
l have to.

17:11.198 --> 17:13.109
Jack?

17:14.367 --> 17:15.982
Please.

We're done here.

17:19.873 --> 17:21.113

We’re done in here.

[Kate] Jack, I’m sorry.
You have to do this.

17:29.299 --> 17:31.130
They said that they couldn’t...

17:35.180 --> 17:37.045
Get her out of there.

17:37.599 --> 17:39.055

18:08.672 --> 18:10.708
Yes. And you better like 'em.

18:11.675 --> 18:13.961
- Or what?
- Or no dessert.

18:15.637 --> 18:18.720

19:04.519 --> 19:06.555
I'm glad.

19:06.896 --> 19:10.309
I realized it was the Feast
of the Ascension and l was feeling bad.

19:10.400 --> 19:13.267
Lot of holy days have come
and gone since you last called.

19:13.361 --> 19:17.024
- I thought you and l were friends.
- I don't wanna run anymore.

What's his name?

Does he know who you are?

Edward, please.

I know you don't want to spend
the rest of your life chasing me.

Please, I love this guy.
Just let me go.

19:36.134 --> 19:37.749
I'll tell you what...

20:18.968 --> 20:21.095
[lock clicking]

20:21.179 --> 20:22.635
[Juliet] Sawyer...

20:24.682 --> 20:26.388
...you really care about him, huh?

20:27.685 --> 20:29.971
Where is he?

20:30.814 --> 20:33.647
I'm sorry you weren't able
to help us, Kate.

20:33.733 --> 20:35.348
[Pickett] Move it, Ford.

20:49.416 --> 20:50.656
Danny.

20:51.000 --> 20:52.991
- Danny!
- [Sawyer] You son of a bitch!

20:57.340 --> 20:58.750
Right. Sorry, Jules.

21:01.428 --> 21:04.215
You got anything you want
to say to your girl...

21:04.681 --> 21:06.763
...you best say it tonight.

21:25.869 --> 21:27.359
And how was your day, honey?

21:30.832 --> 21:32.618
[Locke] When the hatch exploded,

21:32.709 --> 21:35.701
your prayer stick fell out of a tree,
right on top of me.

21:36.713 --> 21:38.169
So Sayid and I went to get it

21:38.256 --> 21:41.043
because it didn't feel right
to bury you without it.

21:42.760 --> 21:45.672
I'd like to think
you died for a reason, Mr. Eko.

21:47.223 --> 21:51.091
Just hope it's not too long before
we find out what the heck it might be.

22:04.199 --> 22:07.032
Rest in peace, Mr. Eko.

22:09.412 --> 22:11.744
And thank you for helping me find my...

22:30.266 --> 22:32.257
I saw Jack.

22:35.647 --> 22:38.059
They brought me in to see him.

22:39.025 --> 22:41.687
- They want him to do surgery on Ben.
- Who's Ben?

22:42.111 --> 22:43.817
Henry, the guy who brought us in.

22:44.989 --> 22:48.447
He's sick. And they say if he does it,
they're gonna let us all go.

22:48.535 --> 22:51.618
- And you and me are what, bait?
- Something like that.

22:53.748 --> 22:55.989
At least the doc ain't
dumb enough to do it.

22:57.293 --> 22:59.705
I told him he had to.

23:00.630 --> 23:02.621
Why would you do
something so stupid?

23:02.715 --> 23:05.832
- To save your life.
- My life don't need saving.

23:05.927 --> 23:08.669
You wanna die?
'Cause that's what's gonna happen!

23:10.306 --> 23:13.389
Pickett is waiting for his chance.
I've seen him look at you.

23:13.476 --> 23:15.432
Damn it, Freckles, stay put!

23:15.520 --> 23:17.385
And you know what he's gonna do.

23:17.480 --> 23:19.971
So don't pretend...

23:20.066 --> 23:21.397
...like you don't care.

23:21.484 --> 23:25.397
- Get down, we've been through this!
- Shut up, James.

23:31.953 --> 23:35.662
You don't want Jack to save your life?
Then you're gonna save your own.

23:35.748 --> 23:37.830
We're getting out of here, now.

23:37.917 --> 23:39.202
Stop it! Damn it, Kate!

23:43.673 --> 23:47.131
- Go! Get out of here! Run!
- You're out of your cage.

23:47.218 --> 23:49.083
Why don't you run, Kate?

23:49.178 --> 23:51.555
Because me, I ain't running...

23:53.433 --> 23:55.674
...because there ain't no place to go.

23:57.979 --> 24:00.061
What're you talking about?

24:00.857 --> 24:02.393
We ain't on our island.

24:03.151 --> 24:06.609
We're on another island, like Alcatraz,
a couple miles offshore.

24:07.780 --> 24:10.487
So unless you're a mermaid
or you got a boat...

24:11.826 --> 24:14.033
...there ain't no point.

24:14.454 --> 24:16.615
When were you planning
on telling me this?

24:16.706 --> 24:18.867
- Never.
- Why not?

24:18.958 --> 24:21.199
Why wouldn't you?

24:25.632 --> 24:29.090
'Cause I wanted you to believe
that we had a damn chance.

24:51.532 --> 24:54.490
- What was that for?
- I don't know.

25:00.750 --> 25:02.581
[sobbing] I don't know.

26:15.032 --> 26:16.693
Very nice.

26:18.369 --> 26:20.075
OK, now it's your turn.

26:21.706 --> 26:23.662
Look under your place mat.

26:24.459 --> 26:28.247
- What did you do?
- Just look.

26:28.337 --> 26:29.417
What is it?

26:29.505 --> 26:32.087
You know that honeymoon
I've been promising you?

26:32.175 --> 26:35.667
You are holding in your hand
two tickets to Costa Rica.

26:35.762 --> 26:38.128
So get your passport ready, baby.

26:40.516 --> 26:42.097
Hey...

26:44.187 --> 26:45.848
...what's wrong?

26:47.023 --> 26:48.934
Nothing.

26:50.318 --> 26:52.354
| just love you so much.

26:56.157 --> 26:57.863
Come here.

27:28.898 --> 27:30.980
Let me ask you something, Freckles.

27:34.529 --> 27:37.020
The day Blockhead was beatin' on me...

27:37.114 --> 27:39.651
...and you said,

27:39.742 --> 27:41.243
"I love you,"

27:41.327 --> 27:42.737
that was just to...

27:44.789 --> 27:46.575
...get him to stop, right?

28:22.034 --> 28:23.774
I love you too.

28:38.926 --> 28:41.668
- [static popping, hissing]
- [grunting]

28:53.316 --> 28:54.977
Who is this?

28:56.319 --> 28:58.435
Hello?

28:58.905 --> 29:00.645
Hello!

29:02.992 --> 29:04.857
[woman] Try it. The door.

30:38.838 --> 30:41.204
If it helps, I was surprised too.

30:43.467 --> 30:44.673
If I were a betting man,

30:44.760 --> 30:47.217
- I would have picked her and you.
- Shut up!

30:51.350 --> 30:53.386
Well...

30:53.477 --> 30:57.766
...this would be the proverbial
nail in my coffin, wouldn't it?

31:06.699 --> 31:08.439
Tomorrow.

31:09.452 --> 31:11.534
- Sorry?
- Tomorrow morning.

31:11.620 --> 31:13.485
First thing.

31:15.624 --> 31:18.286
And everything I mentioned before.

31:18.377 --> 31:21.540
The instruments, anesthesia.
Someone who can hold a clamp.

31:21.630 --> 31:23.416
Yes. Of course.

31:23.507 --> 31:26.249
I'll get it out. Your tumor.

31:26.802 --> 31:28.793
And I'll keep you alive.

31:34.935 --> 31:37.096
But I need your word.

31:38.147 --> 31:40.980
I need what you
promised me before.

31:41.859 --> 31:44.475
I need to get the hell off this island.

31:50.659 --> 31:51.648
Done.

32:18.854 --> 32:20.685
[exhales]

32:23.192 --> 32:25.148
[sighs]

32:30.032 --> 32:32.489
[sobbing]

32:49.635 --> 32:52.468
[clicking keyboard]

32:54.431 --> 32:55.557
What you working on?

32:55.641 --> 32:59.099
Just finishing some le on that
fugitive recovery out of Tampa.

32:59.186 --> 33:03.270
That's what being a cop is,
endless paperwork. Thank you, sweetie.

33:09.822 --> 33:12.029
What if I told you
l was a fugitive?

33:16.370 --> 33:19.328
What if I told you l was on the run
for blowing up my father,

33:19.415 --> 33:22.703
and it was only a matter of time
before you found out?

33:23.752 --> 33:26.368
- This isn't funny.
- It's not a joke.

33:27.756 --> 33:29.838
I almost had a baby, Kevin.

33:29.925 --> 33:32.302
Me! A baby!

33:33.679 --> 33:35.715
I can't do this.

33:35.806 --> 33:39.594
- Taco night? I don't do taco night!
- OK, calm down, Monica.

33:39.685 --> 33:41.425
My name's not Monica!

33:49.028 --> 33:50.859
I love you.

33:53.115 --> 33:54.821
But I can't stay.

33:59.288 --> 34:01.279
No, wait, hang on.
Whoa...

34:04.084 --> 34:05.039
Kev.

34:05.127 --> 34:08.460
- Something's wrong with me.
- l drugged you.

34:08.547 --> 34:10.048
- You what?
- I had to.

34:10.132 --> 34:12.214
Othenivise they would think you knew.

34:12.301 --> 34:15.668
People are gonna ask questions,
I didn't want you to lose yourjob.

34:57.346 --> 34:59.678
This is gonna be
a very tricky procedure.

34:59.765 --> 35:03.883
If I tell you to do something,
I need you to do it, no questions asked.

35:03.978 --> 35:05.934
Is that understood?

35:06.021 --> 35:10.264
You may find this hard to believe,
but I'm very good at following orders.

35:12.319 --> 35:14.651
Is that a yes?

35:14.738 --> 35:16.023
Yes.

35:16.949 --> 35:20.066
Good. Let's go.

35:28.836 --> 35:31.293
[monitor beeping]

35:31.380 --> 35:33.086
[Ben] Do you get nervous?

35:35.050 --> 35:36.961
Before you do surgery?

35:37.052 --> 35:40.089
| used to. But not anymore, no.

35:52.067 --> 35:54.058
Whatever happens...

35:54.153 --> 35:57.316
...everything will be
very different, won't it?

35:57.406 --> 35:59.067
No doubt about it.

36:04.121 --> 36:05.736
Juliet...

36:07.416 --> 36:09.077
...did Alex ask about me?

36:10.044 --> 36:11.375
No.

36:11.462 --> 36:13.498
We took her home last night.

36:13.589 --> 36:15.454
I don't know where she is now.

36:16.383 --> 36:18.965
Well, see ya on the other side.

36:25.642 --> 36:27.348
I'm ready.

36:28.270 --> 36:30.761
I need you to count down from 20.

36:32.107 --> 36:33.608
Twenty...

36:34.360 --> 36:35.975
...19...

36:37.738 --> 36:39.023
...18...

36:43.452 --> 36:45.113
Scalpel.

37:01.595 --> 37:03.460
Let's go.

37:05.766 --> 37:10.635
- Ben's just gone into surgery.
- Ben put his life in the hands of them.

37:10.729 --> 37:13.141
Shephard wasn't even on Jacob's list.

37:16.235 --> 37:19.523
- Sawyer. Sawyer!
- Well, look who got out of her cage.

37:19.613 --> 37:21.649
Should've run when you had the chance.

37:21.740 --> 37:24.903
- Let's go, James.
- Don't! You don't have to do this!

37:24.993 --> 37:29.032
He's coming with me. There's
nothing you can do about it! Step away.

37:30.040 --> 37:34.579
[monitor beeping]

37:34.670 --> 37:36.661
Give me another hemostat.

37:54.857 --> 37:56.563
Swab again.

38:01.196 --> 38:02.697
Clamp.

38:18.213 --> 38:22.752
[beeping rapidly]

38:22.843 --> 38:26.802
- What happened? Is he OK?
- [man] His blood pressure's dropping.

38:26.889 --> 38:30.006
- Should he be bleeding like that?
- Nope. No, he shouldn't.

38:30.350 --> 38:32.477
[clattering]

38:32.561 --> 38:33.892
Back away from the table.

38:33.979 --> 38:35.935
Back away from the table! Now!

38:36.023 --> 38:38.730
[rapid beeping]

38:49.244 --> 38:51.860
- Can you hear me in there?
- Yeah.

38:52.581 --> 38:54.162
Good.

38:54.249 --> 38:57.582
| just made a small incision
in Ben's kidney sack.

38:57.669 --> 39:00.502
Now, if I don't stitch that back up
in the next hour...

39:01.840 --> 39:03.421
...he's dead.

39:06.887 --> 39:09.549
Now get in here
and bring that walkie-talkie.

39:10.098 --> 39:11.804
- Step away!
- No!

39:24.863 --> 39:27.400
You let go or I do her too.

39:29.618 --> 39:32.109
- Let go.
- Don't you let go!

39:34.915 --> 39:37.873
Don't even think about it, Sawyer!
You fight!

39:37.960 --> 39:39.450
No! No!

39:40.128 --> 39:42.039
Sawyer! No!

39:42.464 --> 39:44.796
No! No!

39:45.634 --> 39:48.876
Sawyer, please!
You get your hands off of him!

39:48.971 --> 39:50.461
Get down on your knees!

39:52.140 --> 39:55.223
Please! I will do anything you want!

39:55.310 --> 39:57.266
I want you to watch.

39:58.480 --> 40:00.971
- Close your eyes, Freckles.
- Stand up!

40:01.191 --> 40:03.307
Close your eyes!

40:08.615 --> 40:11.448
No! No! No!

40:13.328 --> 40:15.364
This is for Colleen,

40:15.455 --> 40:16.786
you son of a bitch!

40:27.509 --> 40:31.548
[man] Danny! You there? Pick it up!
Pick it up, Danny! Pick it up, damn it!

40:33.724 --> 40:34.930
I'm here. What?

40:35.017 --> 40:36.803
You anywhere near the cages?

40:38.061 --> 40:39.437
Yeah. You could say that.

40:39.521 --> 40:43.059
- Give your walkie to Kate.
- Now, why the hell would I do that?

40:48.196 --> 40:51.438
Because if you don't,
the doctor's gonna let Ben die.

40:51.533 --> 40:53.945
What are you talking about?
What's beeping?

40:54.036 --> 40:56.448
Just hand her the damn walkie, Danny!

41:00.125 --> 41:02.207
Do it. Just do it now!

41:09.384 --> 41:10.885
Let go of her.

41:12.721 --> 41:14.461
Jack?

41:14.556 --> 41:16.057
Jack!

41:27.778 --> 41:31.691
Kate, you have about an hour head start
before they come after you.

41:34.326 --> 41:36.988
Wait, where are you? Where are you?

41:39.748 --> 41:43.286
Do you remember what I told you
on the beach, the day of the crash?

41:43.377 --> 41:47.086
Do you remember what story I told you
when you were stitching me up?

41:48.215 --> 41:51.753
- Do you remember it?!
- Yes! Yes! I remember!

41:55.430 --> 41:59.469
When you get safe,
you radio me and you tell me that story.

42:01.436 --> 42:03.301
Jack, please.

42:06.191 --> 42:10.275
If you don't call in the next hour, I'll
know something went wrong and he dies!

42:14.074 --> 42:16.611
- I can't leave without you!
- Yes you are. Go.

42:16.702 --> 42:18.818
- Jack, I can't!
- Go! Now!

42:18.912 --> 42:21.779
- I can't!
- Kate! Damn it! Run!
