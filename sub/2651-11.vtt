Sweet. You're the first ones here.
Welcome.

18:07.409 --> 18:09.321
Uh, welcome to what?

18:09.409 --> 18:12.242
To Nude Year's Eve.
You saw the flyer?

18:12.328 --> 18:15.081
No. I told them.

18:15.168 --> 18:16.568
Robby.

18:16.648 --> 18:18.446
So I-Whoa.
Nude Year's Eve?

18:18.568 --> 18:20.639
You said Nude Year's Eve.
It's clever.

18:20.727 --> 18:23.926
Yeah. We're the Palm Springs
Nudist Association.

18:24.007 --> 18:26.044
It's how we celebrate
the new year.

18:26.168 --> 18:28.683
- I can see.
- Fresh. Like newborns.

18:28.767 --> 18:31.680
- Naked.
- Yeah. I got that.

18:31.767 --> 18:34.122
We have to get out of here.
We have to get out of here.

18:34.206 --> 18:36.118
[ Whispering ] Our clothes
are trapped under that pile.

18:36.206 --> 18:37.482
You really wanna
stand there naked...

18:37.567 --> 18:39.320
sifting through
all those drawstring pants?

18:39.446 --> 18:42.006
[ Phil ] Okay. Scooting over.
[ Claire ] Just scootch in.

18:42.087 --> 18:43.760
Okay.
Scootin'.

18:43.847 --> 18:45.121
Oh.
Oh!

18:45.206 --> 18:46.163
Ha.
Hey.

18:46.246 --> 18:47.726
Phil, something
just touched me,

18:47.847 --> 18:49.127
and it's not from your side. Oh!

18:49.246 --> 18:51.637
Who wants champagne? [ Woman
] Oh, I'll have some.

18:51.726 --> 18:53.445
Okay. Oh, my gosh.
Okay.

18:53.567 --> 18:55.046
[ Woman ] Oh, sorry.
Pardon the reach.

18:55.126 --> 18:56.764
Wow.

18:56.846 --> 18:58.166
Thank you.

18:58.245 --> 19:00.396
[ Whispering ] We've
gotta make a run for it.

19:00.525 --> 19:03.563
Well, now it's just gonna seem rude.
Phil!

19:04.445 --> 19:06.836
I love this car so much!

19:06.925 --> 19:08.486
Where you gonna take
us next, Billy Dee?

19:08.566 --> 19:10.797
A surprise
that's gonna blow your mind.

19:10.886 --> 19:13.275
And just call me Billy.
Not doin' it.

19:13.366 --> 19:16.119
[ Laughs ]

19:16.205 --> 19:21.075
And these are from the gentlemen
at that table over there.

19:21.165 --> 19:22.803
Oh, free drinks.
More free drinks.

19:22.885 --> 19:25.116
Thank you. Thank-
They can't hear me.

19:25.204 --> 19:26.524
[ Loudly ] Thank you!

19:26.645 --> 19:29.159
This is what models must feel like.
[ Chuckles ]

19:29.244 --> 19:31.635
Excuse me, but has anyone
ever told you...

19:31.724 --> 19:33.603
you look like
a young Van Johnson?

19:33.684 --> 19:36.244
Oh, no. That-That's so sweet though.
Thank you.

19:36.365 --> 19:38.879
Mmm. Free pass? Pull up Van
Johnson on your phone.

19:39.004 --> 19:41.644
I need to know how I feel about that.
He was gorgeous. You're fine.

19:41.723 --> 19:46.081
This is nice, huh? Compliments, free drinks.
What could be better?

19:46.164 --> 19:49.156
All right, gentlemen.
Almost midnight.

19:49.243 --> 19:50.962
Pucker up.

19:51.044 --> 19:53.877
[Haley] New Year's is so weird, the
way it makes you think about time.

19:53.963 --> 19:55.478
[ All ]
Ten, nine-

19:55.564 --> 19:56.998
[ Sprays ] Cam.

19:57.124 --> 19:58.318
[ Glasses Clink ]
I think that's why...

19:58.404 --> 20:00.680
people put so much pressure
on themselves to have fun.

20:00.763 --> 20:03.278
[ Nudists ]
...seven, six, five-

20:03.363 --> 20:05.082
I mean, I guess I sort of get it.

20:05.163 --> 20:09.043
[ Together ]
...four, three, two, one!

20:09.123 --> 20:11.114
[ All Laugh ]

20:13.482 --> 20:15.793
Quick, quick.
Make your wishes.

20:15.883 --> 20:18.034
Like right now I wish
I could just slow down time,

20:18.123 --> 20:21.514
'cause I am so not ready
for him to grow up yet.

20:22.482 --> 20:24.393
[ Alex Chuckles ] I know.

20:24.481 --> 20:26.439
I want him to stay
our stupid little brother.

20:27.681 --> 20:29.240
[ Watch Beeps ]

20:29.362 --> 20:31.638
Hey, happy New Year.
You too.

20:33.322 --> 20:34.756
Oh, my God.
What is in this?

20:34.882 --> 20:37.316
Oh. Sorry. That one's mine. Oh.

20:40.362 --> 20:43.196
[ All Laughing ] And I swear
to you, I was so nervous,

20:43.281 --> 20:45.513
I think I might have put
on somebody else's underwear.

20:45.642 --> 20:47.917
[ Shudders ] I love this story.

20:48.000 --> 20:49.798
Almost as good as yours,
Van Johnson.

20:49.881 --> 20:51.361
[ Laughs ]
Oh, look. Here comes Jay.

20:51.480 --> 20:53.791
I feel bad he missed all this fun.
Oh.

20:53.920 --> 20:55.640
[ Claire ] Hi. Look, they're back.
My devoted family.

20:55.760 --> 20:59.118
Everyone, this is our dear friend,
Billy Dee Williams. Hey, hey.

20:59.200 --> 21:01.192
[ Whispering ]
Oh, my God, it's Lando.

21:01.280 --> 21:03.273
[ Clears Throat ]
Excuse me, Mr. Williams,

21:03.401 --> 21:06.518
I just have to tell you, I've loved
you since I was a little boy.

21:06.601 --> 21:08.957
[ Laughs ] I'm so starstruck
right now.

21:09.041 --> 21:10.758
You must be Mitchell.

21:10.840 --> 21:12.957
Jay told me all about you.

21:14.640 --> 21:16.153
