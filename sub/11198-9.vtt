00:05.320 --> 00:08.560
<i>Previously on "Stargate SG1":</i>

00:08.640 --> 00:13.280
They are so cool.
Savour the moment, gentlemen.

00:15.560 --> 00:16.640
They're in trouble.

00:16.720 --> 00:20.080
- What would O'Neill do if he was here?
- You want me to shoot you?

00:22.600 --> 00:26.640
- We're here to rescue you.
- We allowed ourselves to be captured...

00:26.720 --> 00:27.880
on purpose.

00:27.960 --> 00:32.479
This is great. Sneakin' around with you
in a Goa'uld pyramid on an alien planet.

00:32.560 --> 00:34.880
The one thing missing
is some Jaffa chasing us.

00:38.120 --> 00:40.400
<i>(Coombs) Felger?. Jay?</i>

00:41.120 --> 00:42.920
- What?
- Snap out of it.

00:43.000 --> 00:45.920
- Sorry.
- Calibration scales for the power source?

00:46.000 --> 00:49.400
Right there. Right... there.

01:02.320 --> 01:03.400
What time is it?

01:03.480 --> 01:06.560
It's two minutes past
the last time you asked me.

01:06.640 --> 01:10.080
- She should be here any second.
- Relax, Jay.

01:10.160 --> 01:14.080
Relax? We are on the verge of
a major scientific breakthrough.

01:14.160 --> 01:17.800
This weapon could be the key factor
in our fight against the Goa'uld!

01:17.880 --> 01:21.840
Is it defeating the Goa'uld you're worried
about or impressing Major Carter?

01:21.920 --> 01:25.960
Unlike some people in this room, I've seen
what the Goa'uld can do first-hand.

01:26.040 --> 01:28.280
I know. You've told me a thousand times.

01:28.360 --> 01:32.040
You rescued SG-1
from the evil Lord Whatshisname.

01:32.120 --> 01:35.120
Her'ak. He wasn't an evil lord.
He was a first prime.

01:35.200 --> 01:40.080
Jay, you're a brilliant scientist.
Some day you'll win the Nobel prize.

01:40.160 --> 01:43.120
What do you care
what these military types think of you?

01:43.200 --> 01:48.520
You don't get it. When you've stood side
by side with someone and faced death,

01:48.600 --> 01:50.800
it creates an unspoken bond.

01:50.880 --> 01:54.640
An understanding
that transcends simple friendship.

01:54.720 --> 01:57.960
Colonel O'Neill and I
have been to hell and back together.

01:58.040 --> 02:00.960
When the mission was over,
you know what he said? He said...

02:01.040 --> 02:03.400
Is this gonna take long?

02:04.560 --> 02:07.040
- Colonel O'Neill.
- Folger.

02:07.120 --> 02:10.800
- Felger. I wasn't expecting you, sir.
- Yes.

02:10.919 --> 02:13.600
Well, Major Carter said this was important.

02:13.680 --> 02:18.600
D-d-d-d-don't touch it, please.
This is a finely calibrated device.

02:18.680 --> 02:22.600
It fires a focused plasma pulse.
Whoo...

02:22.680 --> 02:24.480
boom!

02:28.440 --> 02:34.080
It's an energy-based weapon, sir. It could
perhaps replace the missiles on the X-303.

02:34.160 --> 02:37.160
- Phaser?
- More like a photon torpedo.

02:37.240 --> 02:39.160
My assistant Chloe.

02:40.160 --> 02:42.440
There you are.

02:42.520 --> 02:45.920
- Chloe.
- This is all based on a Goa'uld design.

02:47.960 --> 02:54.200
If you'll join me to the rear of the weapon,
we'll proceed with the demonstration.

02:59.200 --> 03:01.880
My friends, I present to you...

03:01.960 --> 03:03.560
<i>(chuckles)</i>

03:03.640 --> 03:05.840
..the 22nd century!

03:07.960 --> 03:09.960
<i>(humming)</i>

03:12.640 --> 03:14.640
<i>(humming crescendoes)</i>

03:34.480 --> 03:37.560
That wasn't supposed to happen.

04:42.280 --> 04:47.200
<i>I am really sorry, General. I assure you
nothing like this will ever happen again.</i>

04:47.280 --> 04:50.160
It won't, because I'm pulling
the plug on your research.

04:50.240 --> 04:54.960
No, please, General. It was a minor glitch.
We are so close to a working prototype.

04:55.040 --> 04:59.840
You've said that for the last six months.
In fact, I've reviewed your records.

04:59.920 --> 05:03.480
Most of the projects you've overseen
during your tenure here

05:03.560 --> 05:07.200
have been similarly
long on promise and short on results.

05:07.280 --> 05:09.400
What exactly are you saying?

05:09.480 --> 05:13.520
I'm saying it may be time for the Air Force
to rethink your position here.

05:13.600 --> 05:19.320
That'd be a mistake. It just so happens
that I'm working on a line of research,

05:19.400 --> 05:23.520
and it's... Well, I'm on the verge
of a major breakthrough, really.

05:23.600 --> 05:27.400
- Really?
- Really, yes, yes. It's gonna be huge!

05:27.480 --> 05:31.360
It's gonna make the plasma weapon
look like a squirt gun, sir.

05:31.440 --> 05:32.640
- What is it?
- Hm?

05:32.720 --> 05:37.800
- What is it?
- Well, I'm not ready for a presentation yet.

05:37.880 --> 05:41.320
I still gotta crunch a few numbers
and dot a few i's.

05:41.400 --> 05:44.840
I could probably have something ready
by the end of next week.

05:44.920 --> 05:48.200
- You have 24 hours.
- More than enough time.

05:48.280 --> 05:50.480
- Dismissed.
- Thank you.

05:54.400 --> 05:57.000
- What were you thinking?
- I don't know!

05:57.080 --> 06:00.120
I had to say something.
They were gonna fire me.

06:00.200 --> 06:02.720
Besides, all we have to do
is think of something

06:02.800 --> 06:05.880
to change the balance of power
in the galaxy by noon tomorrow.

06:05.960 --> 06:08.560
You have anything in mind?

06:10.840 --> 06:13.440
As a matter of fact I do - Avenger.

06:13.520 --> 06:17.040
You gotta be kidding.
It's nowhere near ready. It's just an idea.

06:17.120 --> 06:20.120
- We can make it work.
- Jay, this is exactly your problem.

06:20.200 --> 06:25.280
You try so hard to impress people, you
always bite off more than you can chew.

06:25.360 --> 06:30.560
OK, yes, you're right. I have to start
setting more realistic goals for myself.

06:30.640 --> 06:33.120
Right after this project, OK?

06:37.800 --> 06:42.560
- A computer virus?
- The gate system's just linked computers.

06:42.640 --> 06:46.880
Delivering the virus is as easy as dialling
the target gate, uploading the program.

06:46.960 --> 06:49.600
The virus would scramble
the DHD's coordinates.

06:49.680 --> 06:54.280
So the symbols no longer
correspond with the proper coordinates.

06:54.360 --> 06:59.360
- And the target gate would be useless.
- The Goa'uld rely heavily on gate travel.

06:59.440 --> 07:02.440
It would be a tactical advantage for us,
don't you think?

07:02.520 --> 07:04.920
- It's interesting.
- Really?

07:05.000 --> 07:07.160
But you don't have a finished program.

07:07.240 --> 07:11.400
Uh, well, not "finished" per se, no.
I really still have to...

07:11.480 --> 07:14.520
- Crunch a few numbers, dot a few i's.
- Exactly, yeah.

07:14.600 --> 07:17.960
I'll look at it. If it shows promise,
I'll take it to Hammond.

07:18.040 --> 07:20.760
- Oh, yes, OK!
- Whoa, whoa.

07:20.840 --> 07:25.960
- Don't celebrate yet. It's not a done deal.
- Of course not. Of course not.

07:31.160 --> 07:33.160
Yes! Yes!

07:35.200 --> 07:37.920
Where am I?
How did she get me here?

07:44.800 --> 07:48.880
You'd rather stay and geek out
a computer program than come with us?

07:48.960 --> 07:52.280
Don't take it personally, sir.
This research shows promise.

07:52.360 --> 07:53.960
It's Felger.

07:54.040 --> 07:57.520
- He did save our lives, Colonel.
- Yeah, don't remind me.

07:57.600 --> 08:03.160
The ability to disable any gate we choose
is a valuable weapon against the Goa'uld.

08:03.240 --> 08:07.720
- If it works.
- That's what I intend to find out.

08:07.800 --> 08:10.560
Don't forget your safety glasses.

08:10.640 --> 08:13.600
Marines, thanks for joining us.

08:13.680 --> 08:15.680
Let's move out.

08:17.560 --> 08:21.680
To be honest, Major, I share
some of the colonel's scepticism.

08:21.760 --> 08:26.480
I know Dr Felger's record is a little
sketchy, but I think he shows potential.

08:26.560 --> 08:29.240
All he needs is a little support.

08:42.280 --> 08:44.560
<i>(knock at door)</i>

08:44.640 --> 08:46.640
Just a minute.

08:58.200 --> 09:00.200
Oh, jeez.

09:01.680 --> 09:06.560
I'll be with you in a second.
Just, you know, putting the dogs out.

09:10.480 --> 09:14.160
- Oh, Major Carter.
- I was in the neighbourhood.

09:15.600 --> 09:19.320
- This isn't a bad time, is it?
- Oh, no, no. Please, come in, come in.

09:19.400 --> 09:23.760
Just, you know, just, uh,
really wasn't, uh, expecting anyone.

09:23.840 --> 09:25.440
Sorry.

09:25.520 --> 09:29.200
- Nice place.
- Oh, thank you. I was having it fumigated.

09:29.280 --> 09:32.520
- Can I offer you anything?
- No, no, I'm fine.

09:32.600 --> 09:34.600
Oh, all righty.

09:35.520 --> 09:37.320
Please, please.

09:42.880 --> 09:46.520
Uh, what, uh, what brings you by?

09:46.600 --> 09:49.560
I took your proposal
to General Hammond.

09:49.640 --> 09:52.240
- And?
- He's agreed to give you another chance.

09:52.320 --> 09:55.520
Oh, thank God. Oh, thank God.
That's great. That's great.

09:55.600 --> 09:59.360
Cos I thought I was so done for
after that little incident thing.

09:59.440 --> 10:01.880
- There is one condition.
- Sure. OK.

10:01.960 --> 10:04.800
He wants me to work
on the project with you.

10:08.400 --> 10:10.400
That'd be, uh, you?

10:10.480 --> 10:14.440
- Yeah. That's not a problem, is it?
- No, no, no. God, no, no.

10:14.520 --> 10:15.920
What about SG-1?

10:16.000 --> 10:20.440
- Daniel's working on a relocation project.
- The moon in the decaying orbit?

10:20.520 --> 10:24.720
They're experiencing severe seismic
disturbances and weather anomalies.

10:24.800 --> 10:26.880
What about Colonel O'Neill? Teal'c?

10:26.960 --> 10:30.240
They've some negotiations
with the rebel Jaffa leaders.

10:30.320 --> 10:36.240
- There's been some infighting, rivalries.
- Well, they have to settle that. Yeah, yeah.

10:36.320 --> 10:38.800
I guess that means
you get stuck with me, then.

10:38.880 --> 10:41.440
No, no, I wouldn't put it that way.

10:41.520 --> 10:46.200
I think the basic idea behind the virus
is actually quite brilliant.

10:46.280 --> 10:47.880
No...

10:48.800 --> 10:50.840
- Really?
- Yeah.

11:02.560 --> 11:05.480
- A tie?
- I wear ties.

11:05.560 --> 11:07.360
<i>And cologne?</i>

11:07.440 --> 11:12.320
There is nothing wrong with a man taking
pride in his appearance... and smell.

11:12.400 --> 11:15.720
This wouldn't have anything
to do with Major Carter, would it?

11:15.800 --> 11:19.080
- Don't be ridiculous.
- Here. Let me.

11:20.640 --> 11:22.640
Of course, you do have to admit

11:22.720 --> 11:28.040
she possesses one of the most
brilliant scientific minds of our generation.

11:28.120 --> 11:30.440
And a pair of legs that won't quit...
Agh!

11:30.520 --> 11:32.720
- OK. OK.
- Sorry.

11:32.800 --> 11:37.640
Well, anyway, what chance has
a guy like me got with a woman like that?

11:37.720 --> 11:39.880
She barely notices me.
Know what that's like?

11:39.960 --> 11:41.240
A little.

11:41.320 --> 11:43.920
- Morning.
- Oh, hi. Hi.

11:46.160 --> 11:48.160
- Nice tie.
- Oh, thanks.

13:14.360 --> 13:16.160
We think the virus is ready.

13:16.240 --> 13:20.760
Of course, there's no real way to test it,
except on another gate.

13:20.840 --> 13:23.800
- Do you have a target in mind?
- P5S-117.

13:23.880 --> 13:26.080
Ba'al's main naqahdah mining site.

13:26.160 --> 13:29.480
If we can disable the gate,
we'd disrupt his supply network.

13:29.560 --> 13:31.720
How will we know if it's successful?

13:31.800 --> 13:37.520
A Tok'ra operative there can relay the
results via their communication network.

13:37.600 --> 13:39.400
Send the virus.

13:39.480 --> 13:41.480
Yes, sir.

13:45.280 --> 13:47.280
You'll wear a hole in the floor.

13:47.360 --> 13:50.080
Those Tok'ra are taking their sweet time.

13:50.160 --> 13:52.440
We should've heard something by now.

13:52.520 --> 13:56.880
<i>(technician) Major Carter to the control
room. Major Carter to the control room.</i>

13:56.960 --> 13:58.960
That's it.

14:13.760 --> 14:16.840
<i>(technician) Chevron seven locked.</i>

14:17.840 --> 14:20.000
- What are you doing here?
- What's going on?

14:20.080 --> 14:23.520
Colonel O'Neill and Teal'c
missed a scheduled radio contact.

14:23.600 --> 14:26.040
Getting a video signal, sir.

14:26.120 --> 14:28.880
Colonel O'Neill, this is Hammond.
Do you read?

14:28.960 --> 14:32.160
<i>- Nice to hear from you, General.
- What's your status?</i>

14:32.240 --> 14:36.600
<i>The mission was going according to plan,
then we hit a little snag.</i>

14:36.680 --> 14:38.680
<i>We can't dial the gate.</i>

14:39.720 --> 14:43.800
<i>- Say again?
- We cannot get an outgoing wormhole.</i>

14:43.880 --> 14:47.120
<i>We've tried all kinds of addresses,
but we can't get a lock.</i>

14:47.200 --> 14:49.320
Stand by, Colonel.

14:49.840 --> 14:53.520
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
This is just a coincidence.

14:53.600 --> 14:57.120
There's no way this could have
anything to do with my virus. No...

14:57.200 --> 14:59.200
Could it?

15:07.120 --> 15:10.720
There's no way Avenger
could have anything to do with this.

15:10.800 --> 15:14.240
- Avenger?
- That's what I call the virus.

15:14.320 --> 15:18.880
<i>It's named after a comic book I read
when I was a kid. The Amazing Avenger?.</i>

15:18.960 --> 15:22.160
Green tights, purple cape.
He was super strong, super fast.

15:22.240 --> 15:24.840
Not as fast as The Flash.
That would be ridiculous.

15:26.600 --> 15:31.000
Of course, this isn't ringing any bells
with anybody, is it?

15:32.120 --> 15:36.520
- Could we have sent it to the wrong gate?
- No, sir. We double-checked.

15:36.600 --> 15:40.000
The virus was sent here - P5S-117.

15:40.080 --> 15:43.160
Colonel O'Neill is on P3C-249,
which is here.

15:43.240 --> 15:49.320
Within the gate systems the planets
are close together - about 400 light years -

15:49.400 --> 15:51.400
but that doesn't mean anything.

15:51.480 --> 15:57.240
<i>- And until we hear back from the Tok'ra...
- (man) Unscheduled offworld activation.</i>

15:57.320 --> 15:59.320
<i>(Stargate alarm)</i>

16:04.960 --> 16:08.400
Sir, we're receiving an audio
transmission. It's the Tok'ra.

16:08.480 --> 16:12.600
<i>- This is Theless of the Tok'ra.
- This is Hammond of Stargate Command.</i>

16:12.680 --> 16:18.360
<i>General, I'm afraid I have to report a
series of malfunctions in the gate system.</i>

16:18.440 --> 16:20.240
Malfunctions?

16:20.320 --> 16:23.680
<i>Several gates have gone offline.
As yet, we have no idea why.</i>

16:23.760 --> 16:25.760
<i>We are gathering information.</i>

16:25.840 --> 16:31.520
This is Major Carter. Do you have any data
on a planet we've designated P5S-117?

16:31.600 --> 16:33.600
<i>One moment, please.</i>

16:35.680 --> 16:38.720
<i>We're still waiting for
a sub-space transmission.</i>

16:38.800 --> 16:42.880
<i>- Can you send us any data you do have?
- Affirmative.</i>

16:46.480 --> 16:48.680
Transmission received.

16:50.800 --> 16:53.480
Sir, I'll need a few minutes to analyse this.

16:53.560 --> 16:55.360
Go.

17:03.200 --> 17:05.440
I'll go help.

17:07.480 --> 17:09.480
<i>(Carter) There it is.</i>

17:10.560 --> 17:14.800
- I still don't see how this is possible.
- Automatic correlative updates.

17:14.880 --> 17:17.480
I thought those happened
once every 200 years.

17:17.560 --> 17:19.359
<i>That was the theory.</i>

17:20.839 --> 17:23.599
Major Carter, report.

17:23.680 --> 17:27.960
Sir, first I recommend you recall
all of our offworld teams immediately.

17:28.040 --> 17:31.840
It's already being done. The mining team
from P4F-221 is coming through now.

17:31.920 --> 17:36.920
- You might wanna tell them to hurry it up.
- What have you got?

17:42.080 --> 17:47.120
This is the original target gate.
This is Colonel O'Neill's position.

17:47.200 --> 17:51.040
These are the gates
first reported offline by the Tok'ra.

17:52.880 --> 17:55.680
A few minutes later... several more.

17:55.760 --> 17:58.520
They're spreading out
from the original gate.

17:58.600 --> 18:00.000
Yes, sir.

18:00.840 --> 18:04.200
You still think this is a coincidence?

18:04.280 --> 18:07.840
Well, sir, we think
we may have an explanation.

18:07.920 --> 18:11.600
We know the gate network
undergoes periodic correlative updates

18:11.680 --> 18:13.880
to compensate for stellar drift.

18:13.960 --> 18:18.600
We've never witnessed it, but we believe
the gates dial each other automatically

18:18.680 --> 18:21.320
to transmit
the new coordinates that apply.

18:21.400 --> 18:25.760
And you believe Dr Felger's virus
initiated one of these updates?

18:25.840 --> 18:30.840
It may have triggered
an automatic internal protocol in the DHD.

18:30.920 --> 18:33.000
Before adapting the new coordinates,

18:33.080 --> 18:36.600
it dialled out and transmitted them
to a few neighbouring gates,

18:36.680 --> 18:39.720
who then transmitted to a few more,
and so on and so on...

18:39.800 --> 18:43.280
- And so on.
- Is there any way we can stop it?

18:43.360 --> 18:48.560
No time, sir. If each gate only dials two
others before adapting to the new system,

18:48.640 --> 18:52.040
the entire network will be infected
in less than two hours.

18:52.120 --> 18:57.160
We need to focus on getting
as many people back as possible, sir.

19:01.920 --> 19:04.120
He's really mad, isn't he?

19:08.440 --> 19:10.640
That's the last of the miners, sir.

19:10.720 --> 19:12.720
Shut it down.

19:16.360 --> 19:18.360
What's next?

19:19.400 --> 19:21.840
P3L-997.

19:21.920 --> 19:25.360
- That's Daniel's team, sir.
- Dial it.

19:30.920 --> 19:33.720
OK, breathe. Everything's gonna be fine.

19:33.800 --> 19:35.960
- Grover Cleveland High School.
- What?

19:36.040 --> 19:39.440
Chemistry 201.
I had an incident with my midterm lab.

19:39.520 --> 19:44.640
They got the fire under control, but poor
Mr Hoffman's eyebrows never grew back.

19:44.720 --> 19:48.920
I should have got out of science right then
and saved everybody the trouble.

19:49.000 --> 19:52.680
This is SGC. You wouldn't be here
if you weren't good at what you do.

19:52.760 --> 19:55.000
You tell that to Colonel O'Neill!

19:55.080 --> 19:57.240
<i>(clears throat)</i>

19:57.320 --> 19:59.800
- How many teams came back?
- Three.

19:59.880 --> 20:02.920
- Out of how many?
- 15. The rest are stranded.

20:03.000 --> 20:07.080
- And Dr Jackson?
- His team's still offworld.

20:07.160 --> 20:08.600
Oh, this is awful.

20:08.680 --> 20:12.640
The flood waters are rising,
but they're safe for the time being.

20:12.720 --> 20:14.720
<i>(phone rings)</i>

20:15.600 --> 20:17.520
Carter.

20:17.600 --> 20:19.520
- General.
- General Hammond.

20:19.600 --> 20:23.000
Yes, sir. I understand.

20:25.960 --> 20:28.080
We contacted the Tok'ra.

20:28.160 --> 20:32.160
According to their intelligence,
the entire gate network is down.

20:44.800 --> 20:47.440
<i>(Hammond) Colonel O'Neill, report.</i>

20:47.520 --> 20:49.840
<i>The mission's been compromised, sir.</i>

20:49.920 --> 20:53.800
<i>Looks like one of the Jaffa
commanders sold us out. Go figure!</i>

20:53.880 --> 20:58.080
<i>- What happened?
- The negotiations were going just fine,</i>

20:58.160 --> 21:00.320
<i>then the gate broke down.</i>

21:00.400 --> 21:05.720
<i>After that, they all started accusing each
other of sabotage and all hell broke loose.</i>

21:05.800 --> 21:10.720
Sir, we think we know what caused
your gate to malfunction. It was the virus.

21:10.800 --> 21:12.400
<i>Felger's virus?!</i>

21:12.480 --> 21:15.640
It created a new coordinate system
that spread to all DHDs.

21:15.720 --> 21:20.120
But, since we don't have a DHD,
we have the only gate that can dial out.

21:20.200 --> 21:24.840
<i>I told you not to trust
that brown-nosing little weasel!</i>

21:24.920 --> 21:27.680
He doesn't know
I'm standing here, does he?

21:27.760 --> 21:31.680
<i>- Sir, I'm as responsible as anyone else.
- (Teal'c) O'Neill.</i>

21:31.760 --> 21:34.560
<i>We've got incoming, sir. It's Alkesh!</i>

21:36.840 --> 21:39.040
- We lost video.
- Must have hit the MALP.

21:39.120 --> 21:44.000
- He was just standing a few feet from it.
- What's your situation? Please respond.

21:51.520 --> 21:53.960
<i>- We're still in one piece, sir.
- Oh, thank God.</i>

21:54.040 --> 21:56.320
<i>We're gonna take cover, sir.</i>

21:56.400 --> 21:58.840
Sir, we could send reinforcements.

21:58.920 --> 22:03.920
They'd be stranded too. I can't send
anyone until we fix this problem.

22:05.800 --> 22:08.120
Let's think this through logically.

22:08.200 --> 22:11.560
The entire gate network is paralysed,
but we can still dial out.

22:11.640 --> 22:15.640
We think the virus was spread due to
correlative updates initiated by the DHDs.

22:15.720 --> 22:18.040
We have no DHD,
so our gate was unaffected.

22:18.120 --> 22:22.880
Right. It also means another change might
result in another system-wide update.

22:22.960 --> 22:27.400
So if we can get just one DHD converted
back to the old coordinate system,

22:27.480 --> 22:30.120
the gate network would spread it for us.

22:30.200 --> 22:34.160
How, when the new one is
based on a completely random principle?

22:34.240 --> 22:38.640
There still must be a pattern. If we can get
one DHD to establish a lock with one gate,

22:38.720 --> 22:43.360
all we gotta do is compare the addresses
and extrapolate a translation program.

22:43.440 --> 22:45.600
That would mean random dialling.

22:45.680 --> 22:49.080
Seven symbols chosen from
a pool of 38 non-repeating candidates?

22:49.160 --> 22:53.240
That's about 63 billion
possible combinations.

22:56.080 --> 22:58.560
She's good with numbers.

22:58.640 --> 23:01.320
I was gonna get her to do my taxes.

23:10.520 --> 23:16.200
- Any word from Colonel O'Neill, sir?
- No. We hope he's just out of range.

23:16.280 --> 23:17.280
Yes, sir.

23:17.360 --> 23:21.880
According to our latest report, Ba'al is
trying to take advantage of the situation.

23:21.960 --> 23:25.080
- How so?
- At the moment he has the largest fleet.

23:25.160 --> 23:28.000
So with the gate system down
he has the advantage.

23:28.080 --> 23:32.160
He's attacking the other System Lords
on several fronts, and he's winning.

23:34.000 --> 23:36.000
<i>(mobile phone rings)</i>

23:45.400 --> 23:47.400
<i>(phone rings)</i>

23:55.120 --> 23:57.960
Stargate Command, Felger speaking.

23:58.040 --> 24:01.400
Mom, Mom, no, no, no.
I told you not to call me here.

24:01.480 --> 24:03.920
You're not supposed to have this number.

24:04.000 --> 24:07.600
I'm sorry I didn't call.
I had to work late. Something came up.

24:09.160 --> 24:12.960
If you must know, Mom,
I screwed up again.

24:14.120 --> 24:17.560
Yeah, and I think this is the worst one yet.

24:17.640 --> 24:20.320
No, no, it's worse than that one.

24:22.080 --> 24:24.760
No, worse than that one too, Mom.

24:25.280 --> 24:30.200
Mom, Mom, Mom, I don't need a list
of my personal failures right now, OK?

24:30.280 --> 24:33.400
To tell you the truth,
I don't know if I can fix this one...

24:33.480 --> 24:35.280
<i>(clears throat)</i>

24:35.360 --> 24:40.600
I'll have to get back to you on that,
Simon, OK? All righty, bye-bye... friend.

24:42.600 --> 24:44.600
It's Coombs. He says hi.

24:45.920 --> 24:50.400
- Jay, I know you feel bad about this.
- What's to feel bad about?

24:50.480 --> 24:55.640
It took the Ancients 1,000 years to build
the gate system, and I wrecked it in a day.

24:55.720 --> 24:59.920
I've also isolated us from all the resources
we'll need to defend ourselves,

25:00.000 --> 25:04.960
leaving us sitting ducks for
the next Goa'uld attack. But who cares?

25:05.040 --> 25:09.280
I need you to get past feeling guilty
and focus on finding a solution.

25:09.360 --> 25:12.440
- But you never make mistakes.
- I don't?

25:12.520 --> 25:16.760
- You're perfect. Everybody knows that.
- Jay, I'm not perfect.

25:16.840 --> 25:19.840
You have to say that
because you're modest,

25:19.920 --> 25:22.720
which is just another aspect
of your perfection.

25:22.800 --> 25:26.560
- Ever heard of a planet called K'Tau?
- That wasn't your fault.

25:26.640 --> 25:31.440
I bypassed dialling protocols that made
the wormhole pass through K'Tau's sun.

25:31.520 --> 25:34.520
It could have led to the deaths
of everyone on that planet.

25:34.600 --> 25:38.520
- That's it! Even your mistakes are perfect.
- What are you talking about?

25:38.600 --> 25:42.480
You bypassed a security protocol
because you created a dialling program.

25:42.560 --> 25:44.800
- So?
- So we can do that here.

25:44.880 --> 25:47.720
Instead of restoring the DHD program
to its original form,

25:47.800 --> 25:50.640
why not upload everything
from our dialling computer?

25:50.720 --> 25:56.160
Our program is not as sophisticated
as the one that exists in the DHDs.

25:56.240 --> 25:59.280
It doesn't have to be perfect, just accurate.

25:59.360 --> 26:02.560
The DHD will automatically
make all necessary adjustments.

26:02.640 --> 26:05.680
- How do you know that?
- Well, it's...

26:05.760 --> 26:10.080
OK, I don't, I don't. But the fact that
Avenger triggered a correlative update

26:10.160 --> 26:14.480
seems to indicate that the DHD program
is adaptive by its very nature.

26:14.560 --> 26:16.960
Plus, we have nothing else.

26:18.360 --> 26:20.720
Trust me, Major, this is gonna work!

26:21.560 --> 26:26.000
<i>Yeah, sorry to rain on your parade, guys,
but it didn't work.</i>

26:26.080 --> 26:27.520
It should have worked.

26:27.600 --> 26:31.240
<i>We tried dialling Earth,
but we couldn't get a lock.</i>

26:31.320 --> 26:36.080
Maybe there's something wrong with
the upload. You can upload better, huh?

26:36.160 --> 26:40.280
<i>If you've got any other bright ideas,
now would be a very good time.</i>

26:40.360 --> 26:44.480
<i>- What's your status, Doctor?
- Flood water's rising pretty fast,</i>

26:44.560 --> 26:47.080
<i>seismic activity is causing rogue waves.</i>

26:47.160 --> 26:51.360
<i>We estimate that within 48 hours
the entire city will be under water.</i>

26:58.320 --> 27:00.320
It should have worked!

27:08.320 --> 27:11.520
Have you and Dr Felger
made any progress?

27:11.600 --> 27:13.680
- I can't find him.
- Excuse me?

27:13.760 --> 27:17.280
Apparently he left the base.
The pressure was getting to him.

27:17.360 --> 27:22.400
- You said all he needed was support.
- I may have been wrong about that.

27:24.320 --> 27:26.800
OK, I admit it.
He's a complete screwup.

27:26.880 --> 27:31.000
He makes rash decisions based on
sketchy evidence, he's clumsy in the lab

27:31.080 --> 27:34.040
and it wouldn't kill him
to ease up on the aftershave,

27:34.120 --> 27:39.880
but the fact is he's at Stargate Command
because he's a brilliant scientist.

27:39.960 --> 27:43.200
No one understands that virus
better than he does.

27:43.280 --> 27:45.920
Then I suggest you get him back.

27:46.000 --> 27:47.200
Yes, sir.

28:02.520 --> 28:05.400
Jay, what're you doing here?
We've got work to do.

28:05.480 --> 28:08.680
- How did you find me here?
- I called your mother.

28:08.760 --> 28:12.320
She told me this is where you come
when you need to think.

28:12.400 --> 28:19.160
I stood here when I figured out how to
recombine epsilon particles in a matrix.

28:19.240 --> 28:22.360
Then I got mugged by some teenagers.

28:22.440 --> 28:25.440
Still, it's a nice spot, though.

28:27.880 --> 28:30.000
What are you doing?

28:30.080 --> 28:32.080
Feeding the ducks.

28:36.600 --> 28:40.560
I need you to come back
to Stargate Command.

28:40.640 --> 28:43.800
Before I joined SGC,
my idea of a high-pressure situation

28:43.880 --> 28:47.640
was defending a mathematical thesis
in front of a roomful of balding men.

28:47.720 --> 28:50.840
I don't do well when the fate
of the universe hangs in the balance.

28:50.920 --> 28:55.720
Jay, you designed the virus.
You're the man for the job.

28:55.800 --> 28:59.400
Forget about the big picture for a second,
and the consequences.

28:59.480 --> 29:02.080
Just focus on the problem.

29:02.160 --> 29:07.000
- Why didn't the upload work?
- I don't know. It should've.

29:07.080 --> 29:12.560
Every gate in the galaxy should be
back online, except for P5S-117.

29:13.720 --> 29:15.720
What do you mean?

29:15.800 --> 29:18.520
Avenger's resistant
to that type of tampering.

29:18.600 --> 29:23.480
I didn't think it made a difference, since
P5S-117 was sabotaged in the first place.

29:23.560 --> 29:29.160
Jay, what if the virus replicated itself and
then travelled along to the other DHDs?

29:29.240 --> 29:31.480
No, it wasn't designed to do that.

29:31.560 --> 29:34.680
It wasn't designed
to trigger a correlative update either.

29:34.760 --> 29:39.360
You said it yourself, Jay.
The DHD program is adaptive.

29:42.240 --> 29:45.560
- Sir, we may have found a solution.
- Let's hear it.

29:47.800 --> 29:51.400
- You want me to tell it?
- It's your project.

29:53.200 --> 29:58.360
We think we know why we can't upload
our dialling program into the gate system.

29:58.440 --> 30:02.680
It now looks like the virus itself somehow
transmitted, with the new coordinates,

30:02.760 --> 30:05.640
to the entire DHD network.

30:05.720 --> 30:08.680
- The virus is blocking the upload.
- That's right.

30:08.760 --> 30:13.280
We need to neutralise it first,
but in order to do that, we have to find it.

30:13.360 --> 30:15.360
I don't understand.

30:15.440 --> 30:20.000
<i>Well, the truth is, we don't know
how the virus was transmitted.</i>

30:20.080 --> 30:25.120
If it piggybacked with the automatic
update, it's in the dialling program itself.

30:25.200 --> 30:29.000
Could be thousands of lines of code -
like looking for a needle in a haystack.

30:29.080 --> 30:35.880
But it exists within a specific sub-routine
in the original target DHD on P5S-117.

30:35.960 --> 30:39.480
The catch is, to make this work,
we have to reboot the system,

30:39.560 --> 30:42.120
which means
removing the control crystal.

30:42.200 --> 30:45.000
Someone's gonna
have to go to the planet, sir.

30:45.080 --> 30:48.800
- P5S-117 is controlled by Ba'al.
- Yes, sir.

30:48.880 --> 30:52.320
General, I'd like to volunteer.

30:53.960 --> 30:57.200
Major Carter has the experience
required for this mission.

30:57.280 --> 31:00.880
Come on, I've got offworld experience.
I battled the Goa'uld.

31:00.960 --> 31:02.560
I zatted a Jaffa.

31:02.640 --> 31:06.840
- Sir, it would be better if we both went.
- Major Carter's right.

31:06.920 --> 31:09.360
Nobody knows more
about Avenger than me.

31:16.840 --> 31:20.840
- Jay, this is crazy.
- I caused this problem. I'm gonna fix it.

31:20.920 --> 31:23.760
You're a research scientist,
not a field operative.

31:23.840 --> 31:28.920
Did that stop me from infiltrating
a Goa'uld mothership? I think not.

31:29.360 --> 31:32.840
They've sent the MALP.
The gate's not even being guarded.

31:32.920 --> 31:37.840
Probably cos it doesn't work any more,
but don't worry about me.

31:37.920 --> 31:40.000
I know what I'm doing, OK?

31:40.480 --> 31:42.480
- Jay?
- Mm?

31:42.560 --> 31:44.840
The antivirus.

31:44.920 --> 31:49.000
OK, yeah, yeah,
I'm gonna need that. All righty.

31:49.080 --> 31:50.880
What?

32:00.440 --> 32:02.040
Wh-what was that for?

32:02.120 --> 32:04.320
Good luck.

32:04.400 --> 32:06.400
Oh, right.

32:39.680 --> 32:41.840
You get set up. I'll be back soon.

32:41.920 --> 32:44.960
- Where are you going?
- I'm gonna check out the area.

32:45.040 --> 32:48.960
Shouldn't we stick together,
in case you need backup or something?

32:49.040 --> 32:51.480
I'll be fine.

32:51.560 --> 32:53.360
OK.

32:55.320 --> 32:57.320
I'm good too!

33:12.640 --> 33:18.240
<i>(O'Neill) Jaffa landed the Alkesh. Teal'c
and I have organised a counterattack.</i>

33:18.320 --> 33:22.400
Be advised, Colonel.
Major Carter has gone to P5S-117.

33:22.480 --> 33:25.240
She's attempting to get
the gate system back online.

33:25.320 --> 33:28.560
<i>- That's occupied territory, sir.
- Yes, it is.</i>

33:28.640 --> 33:30.440
<i>What team did she take?</i>

33:30.520 --> 33:33.400
She didn't want to risk
stranding anyone else.

33:33.480 --> 33:36.080
<i>- She went alone?
- Not entirely.</i>

33:36.160 --> 33:38.160
Dr Felger's with her.

33:38.240 --> 33:41.160
<i>I'm inspired with confidence.</i>

33:47.480 --> 33:49.280
<i>(buzzing)</i>

33:50.040 --> 33:54.120
There's no sign of
any Jaffa activity in the area.

33:54.840 --> 33:56.520
I'm in. I'm in.

33:56.600 --> 33:58.400
Whoo!

34:00.840 --> 34:03.040
Just a sec, just a sec.

34:04.640 --> 34:07.000
- OK, something's wrong.
- What?

34:07.080 --> 34:10.800
This isn't Avenger.
I mean, it is, but something's hinky.

34:10.880 --> 34:14.199
- Hinky?
- Point is, this isn't the program I wrote.

34:14.280 --> 34:16.800
It's been tampered with since it was sent.

34:20.120 --> 34:22.719
- Maybe it was Ba'al.
- Ba'al?

34:22.800 --> 34:25.520
Think about it. He stood the most to gain.

34:25.600 --> 34:29.679
He took your idea and modified it
to bring down the entire gate network,

34:29.760 --> 34:34.239
- knowing it would give him an advantage.
- That means none of this is my fault.

34:34.320 --> 34:37.280
Avenger wasn't designed
to cause a correlative update.

34:37.360 --> 34:40.960
I wouldn't get too excited.
It also means our antivirus won't work.

34:41.040 --> 34:44.800
That's right.
It's designed for the original program.

34:44.880 --> 34:49.880
Which means that we are now stranded
on a Goa'uld-occupied world.

34:49.960 --> 34:54.600
So it's kind of
a "good news, bad news" situation.

35:06.760 --> 35:11.240
The Jaffa aren't as protective of the gate
as they once were, but there'll be a patrol.

35:11.320 --> 35:15.520
- We have to do something.
- Well, I'm open to suggestions here.

35:15.640 --> 35:20.160
You said the virus was modified. So we
need to modify the antivirus to match it.

35:20.240 --> 35:22.760
- Go for it.
- I was hoping you could handle it.

35:22.840 --> 35:25.880
- I was afraid you'd say that!
- You wanna do this instead?

35:25.960 --> 35:30.440
Do you know how many variations I went
through before I got the antivirus right?

35:30.520 --> 35:34.040
- This could take days.
- Then you'd better get started.

35:37.920 --> 35:39.520
Yep.

35:40.880 --> 35:42.680
Oh, yeah.

35:42.760 --> 35:45.520
<i>Still no word from Sam?</i>

35:45.600 --> 35:49.600
To be honest,
we should've heard back by now.

35:49.680 --> 35:53.560
<i>We're gonna have to abandon
the Stargate and move to higher ground.</i>

35:53.640 --> 35:56.440
Very well. Good luck, Dr Jackson.

36:04.960 --> 36:07.560
- How's it coming?
- We're getting there.

36:07.640 --> 36:09.800
It's pretty cool, us working together.

36:09.880 --> 36:14.160
We're sort of like the intellectual
Butch and Sundance of the SGC.

36:14.240 --> 36:18.840
Butch and Sundance got cornered
and killed by the Bolivian army.

36:18.920 --> 36:20.920
That's a good point, yeah.

36:24.480 --> 36:26.600
What? What? What?

36:26.680 --> 36:28.880
- We got trouble.
- What kind of trouble?

36:28.960 --> 36:31.840
- Think Bolivia.
- Oh! Jaffa?

36:33.520 --> 36:36.720
They made our position. Keep working.

36:44.160 --> 36:45.400
Oh.

36:51.800 --> 36:55.280
Concentrate, Jay. Concentrate.
Just background noise.

37:02.560 --> 37:03.560
Argh!

37:07.800 --> 37:10.160
How's it coming?

37:10.240 --> 37:12.240
I'm feeling a little rushed. Oh!

37:15.360 --> 37:17.800
There's not enough time.
There's not enough time.

37:32.600 --> 37:35.640
<i>(engine rumbling)</i>

37:55.080 --> 37:56.280
Argh!

37:59.920 --> 38:02.960
<i>(horn blows)</i>

38:16.400 --> 38:18.200
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

38:29.400 --> 38:34.000
O'Neill! It's Colonel O'Neill!
Thank God! Oh, you would not believe...

38:34.080 --> 38:38.080
Felger. Felger. Felger!
What did I say about touching?

38:38.160 --> 38:41.480
Absolutely. It's just that
we were over there, they came,

38:41.560 --> 38:44.360
then you... over there,
but now you're here.

38:44.440 --> 38:48.040
- Nice work.
- How'd you manage this one, sir?

38:48.120 --> 38:51.120
We got tired of waiting.

39:02.120 --> 39:05.480
- Major, Doctor, welcome back.
- Sir.

39:05.560 --> 39:08.840
I trust the solution you found
is of a permanent nature?

39:08.920 --> 39:15.400
Yes, General. I modified the antivirus to
neutralise the altered version of Avenger.

39:15.480 --> 39:17.760
But I also added a patch to ensure...

39:17.840 --> 39:21.600
The problem is solved, sir. Permanently.

39:21.680 --> 39:25.840
Dr Jackson managed to get the remaining
inhabitants of 997 to the Alpha site.

39:25.920 --> 39:30.000
- Good to hear it, sir.
- What about Colonel O'Neill and Teal'c?

39:30.080 --> 39:33.680
They found an alternate means
of transport.

39:33.760 --> 39:38.920
I promised the colonel I wouldn't say
anything. He wants it to be a surprise.

39:50.480 --> 39:52.960
- I was so worried about you.
- It was no big deal.

39:53.040 --> 39:55.880
Those Jaffa, they could have killed you.

39:55.960 --> 39:57.960
Not a chance, baby.

40:06.760 --> 40:08.400
What is this?

40:08.480 --> 40:10.080
Oh...

40:10.160 --> 40:11.960
Hi, guys.

40:12.040 --> 40:17.480
I know we're not really
supposed to be fraternising, but, hey.

40:17.560 --> 40:22.320
I turn my back for two seconds
and you take up with this... trollop?

40:22.400 --> 40:24.200
Oooh.

40:24.280 --> 40:29.080
Don't blame me just because you were
never woman enough to satisfy him.

40:29.160 --> 40:30.640
Ohh!

40:30.720 --> 40:32.320
That is it.

40:34.040 --> 40:36.040
<i>(grunting)</i>

40:40.600 --> 40:43.800
- Ladies, this isn't necessary...
- Sh!

40:43.880 --> 40:46.160
Don't talk.

40:46.240 --> 40:47.960
<i>(Chloe) Jay?</i>

40:48.040 --> 40:50.040
<i>Jay?</i>

40:52.200 --> 40:55.120
Jay. Jay!

40:55.200 --> 40:58.880
- What? What?
- What were you thinking about?

41:01.600 --> 41:03.600
Nothing.
