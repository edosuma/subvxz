WEBVTT

00:01.535 --> 00:04.172
TERESA: Previously on
"Queen of the South"...

00:04.205 --> 00:06.407
EL SANTO:
Now you are one of us.

00:06.440 --> 00:08.276
I shall expect the payment
for the metric ton

00:08.309 --> 00:09.643
within the week.

00:09.677 --> 00:11.679
My life is on the line
with El Santo.

00:11.712 --> 00:12.846
Not yours or Camila.

00:12.880 --> 00:14.415
Look what we have here.

00:14.448 --> 00:16.184
Camila Vargas,
you're under arrest.

00:18.219 --> 00:20.854
You walk out of here
and never come back.

00:20.888 --> 00:23.691
Princesa's dad is gonna
kick me to the curb like basura.

00:25.126 --> 00:26.694
(laughs)

00:26.727 --> 00:28.696
Apparently your sicarios
in Dallas

00:28.729 --> 00:30.698
tried to take Camila's life.

00:33.167 --> 00:34.168
(gunshot)

00:34.202 --> 00:35.669
(gunfire)

00:37.871 --> 00:39.173
The priority is to assure
our associates

00:39.207 --> 00:40.974
that everything's well.

00:41.008 --> 00:42.476
Give me one good reason I
shouldn't back out of this

00:42.510 --> 00:43.977
right now.

00:44.011 --> 00:45.546
It's an opportunity
for both of us

00:45.579 --> 00:46.714
to expand our business.

00:46.747 --> 00:48.982
Phoenix, Mesa, Scottsdale.

00:49.016 --> 00:50.218
You got a street gang.

00:50.251 --> 00:53.721
-Lil T.
-Teresa Mendoza.

00:53.754 --> 00:55.156
These are the ownership
documents

00:55.189 --> 00:56.690
filed for Camila's
Trawler company.

00:56.724 --> 00:58.359
TERESA:
I never signed these papers.

00:58.392 --> 01:00.461
-If she puts up a fight...
-Then kill her.

01:00.494 --> 01:02.330
(gunfire)

01:05.233 --> 01:07.235
(screams)

01:07.268 --> 01:09.503
TERESA: In the morning,
we're gonna go back to Dallas

01:09.537 --> 01:11.004
and take what's rightfully mine.

01:14.408 --> 01:15.409
(goat bleats)

01:15.443 --> 01:18.412
EL SANTO: (chanting)

01:35.263 --> 01:36.230
(shouts)

01:41.302 --> 01:45.239
(somber music)

01:45.273 --> 01:46.540
(children speaking Spanish)

01:53.347 --> 01:54.915
EL SANTO: (singing)

01:59.787 --> 02:02.723
Teresa Mendoza...
Teresa Mendoza...

02:02.756 --> 02:04.625
Teresa Mendoza.

02:04.658 --> 02:06.660
(chanting continues)

02:13.801 --> 02:15.236
(speaking Spanish)

02:39.760 --> 02:46.767
*

02:58.879 --> 03:01.815
TERESA: I brought the two of
you together for a reason.

03:01.849 --> 03:03.884
Thank you for allowing us
to meet here.

03:05.286 --> 03:07.421
You know, I heard legends
about you for years.

03:07.455 --> 03:11.325
Kid burst up outta nowhere like
a goddamn Roman Candle.

03:11.359 --> 03:14.127
Carvin' out an empire with
nothin' but his big-sized-brain

03:14.161 --> 03:15.863
and certain amount
of elegant violence.

03:15.896 --> 03:18.766
I'll admit, I was curious
to meet you as well.

03:18.799 --> 03:21.635
You disappeared a competitor
of mine out of South Africa

03:21.669 --> 03:23.271
a few years ago,

03:23.304 --> 03:24.472
as I came to deliver

03:24.505 --> 03:26.507
a bit of "elegant violence."

03:26.540 --> 03:29.009
I'd love to hear how
you did that...

03:29.042 --> 03:31.412
after Ms. Mendoza tells us
what's on her mind.

03:33.847 --> 03:35.182
I'm leaving Camila.

03:35.215 --> 03:37.285
Starting off on my own.

03:40.187 --> 03:42.122
I would like to keep working
with both of you.

03:43.190 --> 03:45.759
She ain't exactly one for
flowery speeches, huh?

03:45.793 --> 03:47.561
No, she's not.

03:47.595 --> 03:50.898
Nothing has to change.
The deal remains the same.

03:50.931 --> 03:53.100
Big britches you're
trying to fill, girl.

03:53.133 --> 03:55.002
There ain't no
trial run on this.

03:55.035 --> 03:56.537
I know the risks.

03:56.570 --> 03:58.506
DEVON: But do you know
the consequences?

03:58.539 --> 04:01.108
If you do succeed,

04:01.141 --> 04:04.545
you will be responsible for more
than just your own life.

04:04.578 --> 04:06.514
The burdens of leadership
are not small.

04:06.547 --> 04:08.582
I understand that.

04:08.616 --> 04:10.318
And I understand the business
up to this point

04:10.351 --> 04:12.386
has been unstable.

04:12.420 --> 04:15.489
Profits will continue,
but the drama will end.

04:15.523 --> 04:17.725
What's your POV on this, Chewy?

04:24.765 --> 04:26.800
Everyone has a right
to the throne.

04:29.503 --> 04:30.704
If they can take it.

04:36.243 --> 04:37.711
Fortunately for you,
the appetite

04:37.745 --> 04:38.746
for your Bolivian connection

04:38.779 --> 04:40.381
seems unquenchable.

04:40.414 --> 04:42.115
As long as you have
El Santo's product,

04:42.149 --> 04:43.684
you have me.

04:43.717 --> 04:46.454
I have it.
The deal remains the same.

04:46.487 --> 04:49.457
I'll sell it to you,
and no one else.

04:49.490 --> 04:52.726
You'll receive details for the
pickup and delivery tomorrow.

04:52.760 --> 04:54.362
Thank you.

05:02.603 --> 05:04.905
I can feel your eyeballs on me.

05:04.938 --> 05:06.173
(chuckles)

05:06.206 --> 05:08.108
You haven't given me
your answer.

05:10.110 --> 05:12.746
It ain't what you're looking
to hear, baby girl.

05:12.780 --> 05:14.448
I'ma have to think on it.

05:14.482 --> 05:16.249
Took heavy losses when
that Jimenez fellow

05:16.283 --> 05:19.286
disrupted our shipment.

05:19.319 --> 05:21.121
Thinking maybe smuggling
guns and ganja

05:21.154 --> 05:23.957
might be just enough
for little ol' me.

05:23.991 --> 05:25.125
You know the profit on guns--

05:25.158 --> 05:26.560
Don't you try and math me.

05:26.594 --> 05:29.296
That gun goes for
50K right there.

05:29.329 --> 05:30.964
And that's just one.

05:30.998 --> 05:33.667
You think this is
about money, girl?

05:33.701 --> 05:35.803
I'm truly sorry for your loss.

05:37.871 --> 05:38.939
Me too.

05:39.673 --> 05:41.675
And I'd like to keep my boys

05:41.709 --> 05:44.678
fat and happy.

05:44.712 --> 05:45.879
And a whole lot less dead.

05:48.949 --> 05:51.284
You're making promises
that you cannot back up

05:51.318 --> 05:53.587
to dangerous men, Teresita.

05:53.621 --> 05:54.988
That's how you get killed.

05:55.022 --> 05:56.890
If I don't pay El Santo,
I'm dead.

05:56.924 --> 05:58.659
Camila has the cash
and the coke.

05:58.692 --> 06:00.628
You got nothing.

06:00.661 --> 06:02.129
That's why we
need to get it.

06:02.162 --> 06:04.164
Camila's facing
federal charges.

06:04.197 --> 06:05.966
They're gonna have to move
the coke out of the country

06:05.999 --> 06:07.535
as soon as possible.

06:07.568 --> 06:09.336
We must steal it back
before they do.

06:09.369 --> 06:11.171
Oh!

06:11.204 --> 06:14.007
You want to rob Camila Vargas?

06:14.041 --> 06:15.643
I need that product.

06:15.676 --> 06:18.178
Not only to pay El Santo.

06:18.211 --> 06:19.813
It means freedom.

06:19.847 --> 06:21.649
It's only you and me.

06:21.682 --> 06:23.183
We don't have the muscle
to go against James

06:23.216 --> 06:24.552
or Camila's men.

06:24.585 --> 06:26.787
That's why we can't
do it alone.

06:26.820 --> 06:29.790
(foreboding music)

06:29.823 --> 06:36.830
*

06:38.131 --> 06:39.467
CAMILA: Teresa was
a stray mutt

06:39.500 --> 06:40.701
when I met her.

06:40.734 --> 06:42.069
I brought her into our family,

06:42.102 --> 06:43.704
let her sleep
under my roof...

06:43.737 --> 06:45.338
Well, what did you expect

06:45.372 --> 06:47.675
after she called
the DEA to "save" you?

06:47.708 --> 06:49.510
Once someone's in bed
with the feds,

06:49.543 --> 06:50.878
you can't ever trust them.

06:50.911 --> 06:53.046
You tried to warn me.

06:53.080 --> 06:54.314
I should've listened.

06:54.347 --> 06:56.817
I opened my arms to that girl

06:56.850 --> 06:59.953
and she spit in my face.

06:59.987 --> 07:02.322
Let her die in the cold
with the other dogs.

07:04.191 --> 07:06.226
Sometimes dogs try
to return home

07:06.259 --> 07:08.562
even after the door is closed.

07:08.596 --> 07:11.565
Well then, make sure there's
no food in the house.

07:11.599 --> 07:13.934
Do you understand?

07:13.967 --> 07:16.103
And James...

07:16.136 --> 07:18.906
they're transferring me tonight
to a maximum security facility.

07:18.939 --> 07:21.909
I heard it's gonna be
a beautiful evening.

07:21.942 --> 07:23.577
I want to see the sky.

07:30.584 --> 07:33.554
(Spanish rap)

07:33.587 --> 07:40.293
*

07:57.144 --> 07:59.046
LIL T: That's my uncle.

07:59.079 --> 08:01.481
He's our leader.

08:01.515 --> 08:04.051
Took a .22 three times
to the back, point blank.

08:04.084 --> 08:05.786
Pow pow pow.

08:05.819 --> 08:08.455
My uncle took that puto
out with his bare hands,

08:08.488 --> 08:11.324
crawlin' around like
a pinche salamander and shit.

08:11.358 --> 08:13.661
He ain't nothing
to fuck with.

08:13.694 --> 08:15.295
That dude over there
eyeballing us...

08:16.163 --> 08:17.665
That's Chucho.

08:17.698 --> 08:19.332
That's my uncle's
number two.

08:21.569 --> 08:23.470
Stop!

08:23.503 --> 08:25.338
(music stops)

08:30.978 --> 08:33.013
Who the hell are you?

08:33.046 --> 08:34.648
You ain't welcome here.

08:34.682 --> 08:36.717
You said you spoke with him.

08:36.750 --> 08:38.385
Figured it was
better in person.

08:38.418 --> 08:40.420
-Tio, this is--
-I'm not talking to you.

08:40.453 --> 08:43.857
(tense music)

08:43.891 --> 08:50.163
*

08:50.197 --> 08:52.132
I'm here to talk about business.

08:52.165 --> 08:54.201
Wrong place,
wrong time, Esa.

08:56.536 --> 08:58.405
I heard you're a businessman.

09:01.441 --> 09:02.910
I'm looking for a partner.

09:04.745 --> 09:07.047
Go home, business lady.

09:07.080 --> 09:08.849
I'm not leaving here
without talking to you.

09:08.882 --> 09:10.550
And you're gonna listen.

09:12.052 --> 09:13.553
The fuck you just say to me?

09:13.587 --> 09:15.155
You can either turn around
and leave

09:15.188 --> 09:16.423
or die standing here.

09:18.692 --> 09:25.633
*

09:33.907 --> 09:35.609
Yo, what the hell,
are you stupid?

09:35.643 --> 09:37.010
Do you know who
this is, fool?

09:37.044 --> 09:38.078
I don't give a fuck
who this is!

09:38.111 --> 09:39.079
He's a Vargas sicario.

09:43.951 --> 09:45.919
I'm not here for a fight.

09:48.055 --> 09:49.089
I'm here to make a deal.

09:52.559 --> 09:54.928
My name's Teresa Mendoza.

09:54.962 --> 09:56.529
I think we can
help each other.

09:56.563 --> 09:58.498
How come you ain't talking
to Los Treintas?

09:58.531 --> 10:02.502
Last time I checked, you got
those pussies running for you.

10:02.535 --> 10:04.404
Los Treintas works
with Epifanio.

10:04.437 --> 10:05.939
You working for Camila?

10:05.973 --> 10:07.040
I was.

10:07.074 --> 10:08.608
But I'm on my own now.

10:08.642 --> 10:10.077
She has something of mine.

10:10.110 --> 10:11.945
I need help taking it back.

10:11.979 --> 10:13.714
-What?
-Cocaine.

10:16.083 --> 10:18.585
Going up against the cartel
is serious shit.

10:19.586 --> 10:21.054
What you offering?

10:21.088 --> 10:23.456
The Vargas and Jimenez Cartel
consolidated

10:23.490 --> 10:25.558
in one cartel.

10:25.592 --> 10:27.360
Your enemies are united.

10:27.394 --> 10:30.864
You're gonna need real firepower
to protect your people.

10:30.898 --> 10:32.632
I have something that you need.

10:32.666 --> 10:34.301
-Guns.
-And product.

10:34.334 --> 10:36.737
Work with us, we arm your men

10:36.770 --> 10:38.739
for the fight you know
is coming.

10:38.772 --> 10:40.240
Plus, you get 10%
of the profit

10:40.273 --> 10:43.443
of the product that you
help us get back.

10:43.476 --> 10:45.645
-We get the guns first?
-Yes.

10:48.816 --> 10:49.983
You got balls.

10:51.819 --> 10:54.087
But if this shit
is true, then...

10:54.121 --> 10:56.990
the enemy of my enemy
is my homie, right?

10:58.726 --> 11:01.661
That's some serious cash you're
offering for a little muscle.

11:01.695 --> 11:03.831
TERESA: I believe
in a fair deal.

11:06.700 --> 11:08.468
All right.

11:08.501 --> 11:10.237
You get us the guns...

11:10.270 --> 11:12.339
we'll help you get your coke.

11:12.372 --> 11:15.342
(dramatic music)

11:15.375 --> 11:20.781
*

11:23.450 --> 11:26.119
I told you, I don't want to hear
anymore about it, Isabela.

11:26.153 --> 11:28.588
Papi, she needs our help.
Please.

11:28.621 --> 11:30.457
You may think you know
your mother, Bela,

11:30.490 --> 11:33.293
but I know that woman better
than you should ever hope to.

11:33.326 --> 11:35.028
You want her to bend,
to change,

11:35.062 --> 11:36.864
but she's made of the hardest
steel, my love.

11:36.897 --> 11:38.631
We will break before she does.

11:38.665 --> 11:40.433
And I won't watch
that happen to you.

11:40.467 --> 11:42.569
She's better right
where she is.

11:43.904 --> 11:45.806
You had me fooled, Papi.

11:46.506 --> 11:49.843
You told me what you
went through as a kid.

11:49.877 --> 11:53.513
I thought that kind of struggle
makes someone's heart bigger.

11:53.546 --> 11:55.115
But you're a small man.

11:55.148 --> 11:56.616
How dare you talk
to me like that?!

11:58.485 --> 12:00.187
You never struggled
one day in your life.

12:00.220 --> 12:02.689
-I saw to that.
-You don't think I struggle?

12:02.722 --> 12:04.524
You don't think I'm
in there with her?

12:04.557 --> 12:06.827
That she didn't leave me too?
Are you that blind?

12:06.860 --> 12:08.728
-Isabela!
-Don't.

12:08.762 --> 12:10.563
I'm staying with Olivia
at her family's ranch,

12:10.597 --> 12:12.332
and I'm not coming home
until Mom does too.

12:12.365 --> 12:14.768
- Well, enjoy your stay.
Like mother, like daughter!

12:14.802 --> 12:16.503
Spoiled and pigheaded!

12:16.536 --> 12:18.371
I gave you that
beautiful life, Bela!

12:18.405 --> 12:19.873
And it can all be taken away!

12:19.907 --> 12:21.474
Just ask your mother!

12:23.076 --> 12:24.344
I need guns, and I
need them fast.

12:24.377 --> 12:26.079
(laughs)

12:26.113 --> 12:28.315
Something tells me you ain't
taking up skeet shootin'.

12:28.348 --> 12:29.749
It's business.

12:33.720 --> 12:35.255
(chuckles)

12:36.957 --> 12:39.059
My daddy killed
all these animals.

12:40.327 --> 12:42.229
Every single one.

12:42.262 --> 12:44.531
Even Timothy here.

12:44.564 --> 12:46.566
What kind of man kills
a goddamn beaver?

12:46.599 --> 12:47.567
I don't know.

12:47.600 --> 12:49.369
Not a happy one.

12:49.402 --> 12:50.871
I'll tell you that much.

12:50.904 --> 12:53.640
He died sad, alone, and empty.

12:54.942 --> 12:56.276
And rich as shit.

12:56.309 --> 12:58.278
I'm not doing this
to get rich.

12:58.311 --> 13:01.748
That's a story a lot of people
tell themselves at first.

13:01.781 --> 13:05.418
How about this--
I got an open slot on my crew.

13:05.452 --> 13:07.620
Been a while since we had
a squaw in our tribe.

13:07.654 --> 13:09.289
You could be my Pocahontas.

13:09.322 --> 13:12.425
(laughs) Or maybe I'll
be your Pocahontas.

13:12.459 --> 13:14.727
We could figure that out
along the way.

13:14.761 --> 13:16.263
Thank you.

13:16.296 --> 13:18.631
But we both know
I have to do this.

13:18.665 --> 13:21.601
What's in it for you, really?

13:22.635 --> 13:24.437
Is it revenge?
That's what you want?

13:24.471 --> 13:26.073
There's a better way
of doing business

13:26.106 --> 13:27.474
than the way Camila does.

13:28.641 --> 13:30.878
And I know you
believe that too.

13:30.911 --> 13:32.512
(sighs thoughtfully)

13:32.545 --> 13:35.548
(somber music)

13:35.582 --> 13:42.489
*

13:42.522 --> 13:44.324
I delivered a small arsenal

13:44.357 --> 13:46.994
to a backwards-ass group
of skinheads about a week ago.

13:49.129 --> 13:50.630
Dudes were sketchy as shit.

13:50.663 --> 13:53.166
Big plans, little brains.

13:53.200 --> 13:56.336
Plus they insulted Bilal,
so fuck 'em.

13:58.872 --> 14:01.308
But don't you let one of those
hillbillies kill you, girl.

14:02.976 --> 14:04.611
'Cause we got an empire
to build.

14:07.414 --> 14:09.316
JAMES: A friend will be
giving you a gift

14:09.349 --> 14:10.984
The moon's gonna be full
at 8:00 tonight.

14:11.018 --> 14:13.020
8:00 p.m.
That's beautiful.

14:13.053 --> 14:14.787
I hope I get to see it.

14:14.821 --> 14:15.923
I'll be looking
for a window.

14:17.024 --> 14:18.225
Talk soon.

14:20.928 --> 14:23.796
(intercom blaring)

14:29.236 --> 14:31.972
All right, Camila's
our priority.

14:32.005 --> 14:33.706
We move at 8:00.

14:33.740 --> 14:36.076
All this product and cash,
it can stay for now.

14:36.109 --> 14:38.946
But I want our best men
on guard, 24/7.

14:38.979 --> 14:41.681
I'm gonna check to make sure
everything's in position.

14:41.714 --> 14:43.683
TERESA: The coke and cash
from Devon's first payment

14:43.716 --> 14:45.218
is at the warehouse.

14:45.252 --> 14:47.487
But security's doubled.

14:47.520 --> 14:49.289
Okay, we have some time now.

14:49.322 --> 14:51.258
We need to get to the location
George gave me.

14:51.291 --> 14:54.361
James' man won't move
the product without him there.

14:54.394 --> 14:56.729
But we don't know how long
he'll be gone.

14:56.763 --> 14:58.898
We have no choice.

14:58.932 --> 15:00.700
Once I get the guns to Big T,

15:00.733 --> 15:02.335
we'll have the muscle
we need.

15:02.369 --> 15:04.837
You're giving guns to thugs.

15:04.871 --> 15:07.740
That's a stupid decision,
Teresita.

15:07.774 --> 15:09.876
Trust needs to be earned.

15:09.909 --> 15:11.711
I didn't have to trust you,
but I did.

15:14.214 --> 15:16.916
And if you hadn't sent
Guero away,

15:16.950 --> 15:18.818
we would have someone
better helping us.

15:20.320 --> 15:21.754
You thought
I didn't know.

15:24.224 --> 15:26.326
Guero and I were
planning to escape.

15:26.359 --> 15:28.295
Then you talked to him.

15:28.328 --> 15:29.796
He needed to go.

15:29.829 --> 15:31.731
That wasn't your
decision to make.

15:31.764 --> 15:33.033
I was trying to keep you safe.

15:33.066 --> 15:35.202
If I don't do this,

15:35.235 --> 15:37.070
El Santo will kill me.

15:37.104 --> 15:39.973
You should know better than
making a deal with a psychopath.

15:41.774 --> 15:43.610
Would you question
Camila like this?

15:43.643 --> 15:45.712
You are no Camila.

15:45.745 --> 15:48.148
Look, if you're not
gonna help me,

15:48.181 --> 15:49.749
please leave.

15:50.883 --> 15:52.119
I'll take care of myself.

15:53.286 --> 15:55.555
Like I did when
Gato raped me

15:55.588 --> 15:56.923
and you stood there watching.

15:56.956 --> 15:59.926
(somber music)

15:59.959 --> 16:06.766
*

16:06.799 --> 16:07.767
(door closes)

16:13.973 --> 16:16.943
(country music plays softly)

16:16.976 --> 16:23.916
*

16:34.294 --> 16:35.828
Y'all got ID?

16:37.297 --> 16:39.132
Heard it on the CB
that a plane landed

16:39.166 --> 16:42.469
in Old Man Cassidy's airfield
about an hour back.

16:44.003 --> 16:47.207
And that looks a hell of a lot
like Cassidy's old Ford truck.

16:50.977 --> 16:52.979
Reckon what I got here is just

16:53.012 --> 16:54.847
a couple of thievin'
border-jumpers.

16:54.881 --> 16:57.517
Please, sir, we need gas
to get to Dallas.

16:59.452 --> 17:00.987
Uh-uh, amigo.

17:01.020 --> 17:02.922
You touch that nozzle,

17:02.955 --> 17:05.024
I'm gonna have to consider it
an act of terror.

17:13.866 --> 17:14.834
What the hell--

17:17.370 --> 17:20.340
(dark music)

17:20.373 --> 17:21.974
*

17:22.008 --> 17:23.510
The guns are in
a storage area.

17:23.543 --> 17:25.678
They think no one
knows the location.

17:25.712 --> 17:26.879
They won't be guarded.

17:26.913 --> 17:27.980
You can go in and out quick.

17:29.716 --> 17:31.784
What, are you making this up
as you go?

17:31.818 --> 17:34.521
You told me uncle you
already had this shit.

17:34.554 --> 17:36.189
And why am I gonna
do you any favors?

17:37.357 --> 17:39.792
Your uncle underestimates you.

17:39.826 --> 17:40.760
You're smart.

17:41.894 --> 17:43.596
And I need your help.

17:43.630 --> 17:44.697
As the business grows,
you can grow with it.

17:47.334 --> 17:49.001
What you need from me?

17:49.035 --> 17:49.969
Men.

17:52.272 --> 17:53.240
There they are.

17:55.942 --> 17:56.976
(indistinct chatter)

17:57.009 --> 17:58.345
I said men.

17:58.378 --> 17:59.479
Not kids.

17:59.512 --> 18:00.913
They ain't much to look at,

18:00.947 --> 18:03.250
but they're hungry
to get into this game.

18:07.086 --> 18:08.821
Okay.

18:08.855 --> 18:10.056
So you're with me?

18:12.225 --> 18:13.926
I got you.

18:13.960 --> 18:15.662
Maybe now Big T
and Chucho'll see

18:15.695 --> 18:18.097
I got bigger balls than
both of them pendejos.

18:19.098 --> 18:22.068
(intense music)

18:22.101 --> 18:29.108
*

18:34.581 --> 18:36.115
(door unlatching)

18:38.618 --> 18:39.952
MAN: Vargas.

18:39.986 --> 18:41.888
You're being transferred.
Let's go.

18:41.921 --> 18:44.891
(evocative techno music)

18:44.924 --> 18:51.931
*

19:26.366 --> 19:28.435
(gagging)

19:28.468 --> 19:30.970
Vargas is convulsing!
Having some kind of seizure!

19:32.205 --> 19:33.406
Help me get her down.

19:33.440 --> 19:35.208
(gagging)

19:35.242 --> 19:37.844
Vargas, I need you to breathe.

19:37.877 --> 19:39.512
-Vargas is unresponsive.
MAN: Stay with me.

19:39.546 --> 19:40.513
WOMAN: We need to get
to a hospital, now.

19:40.547 --> 19:41.681
MAN: Stay with me.

19:44.183 --> 19:46.185
(siren wailing)

19:57.497 --> 19:58.765
(gunfire)

20:03.803 --> 20:04.871
Ugh!

20:14.481 --> 20:15.982
(speaking Spanish)

20:24.924 --> 20:26.493
-Yeah.
CHARGER: They got Camila.

20:26.526 --> 20:28.094
Who?

20:28.127 --> 20:29.296
- Who got her?
CHARGER: I don't know.

20:29.329 --> 20:30.763
Who the fuck has Camila?!

20:35.702 --> 20:38.671
(soft rap music)

20:38.705 --> 20:43.743
*

20:43.776 --> 20:44.744
(giggling)

20:46.245 --> 20:47.414
Shame, shame, Bela.

20:47.447 --> 20:48.881
What would your papi say?

20:48.915 --> 20:50.883
Whatever.
(laughter)

20:50.917 --> 20:52.519
I bet you're happy we didn't go
to my abuelita's

20:52.552 --> 20:53.686
dumbass ranch now.

20:53.720 --> 20:55.221
ISABELA: Where's my phone?

20:55.254 --> 20:56.889
KIQUE: Find it.
Let's make a video.

20:56.923 --> 21:00.126
Ew, no.

21:01.761 --> 21:03.330
I knew you were
too good to be true.

21:03.363 --> 21:06.399
Ooh, ay yi yi, that's a low blow
right there.

21:06.433 --> 21:08.468
You must take it back.
I demand it.

21:09.536 --> 21:11.504
So I'm gonna have to...

21:11.538 --> 21:13.172
torture you.

21:13.205 --> 21:15.007
(laughter)

21:15.041 --> 21:16.576
Seriously, though,
where's my phone?

21:16.609 --> 21:18.110
(sighs)

21:18.144 --> 21:19.612
(laughing)

21:19.646 --> 21:21.314
Hey, idiots.

21:21.348 --> 21:23.616
Why would you leave
your phones down there?

21:23.650 --> 21:26.052
-Are you stupid?!
-(laughing)

21:26.085 --> 21:28.321
Pedro, what the hell's
your problem, bro?

21:30.823 --> 21:32.258
(laughter)

21:33.826 --> 21:36.162
What up, cuz!

21:38.230 --> 21:39.566
ISABELA: What are your
cousins doing here?

21:39.599 --> 21:41.434
KIQUE: They're not my cousins.

21:41.468 --> 21:43.235
They're from Pedro's mother's
side of the family.

21:43.269 --> 21:44.671
I want to go. Now.

21:46.305 --> 21:47.940
No one's going anywhere,
Princesa.

21:47.974 --> 21:49.642
Party's just getting started.

21:49.676 --> 21:52.278
Let's put these pendejos
somewhere for safekeeping.

22:00.319 --> 22:02.389
The storage room where
all the guns will be

22:02.422 --> 22:03.856
is back this way.

22:03.890 --> 22:07.927
We go in, we grab them,
we go, okay?

22:07.960 --> 22:09.095
Sure this is the right place?

22:09.128 --> 22:10.830
Yeah, I'm sure.

22:19.005 --> 22:21.974
(suspenseful music)

22:22.008 --> 22:28.415
*

22:37.056 --> 22:38.458
TERESA: There's the guns.

22:38.491 --> 22:39.526
Get these cases
back to the cars.

22:39.559 --> 22:40.860
Come on.

22:43.563 --> 22:50.570
*

22:51.704 --> 22:52.839
I know that church.

22:54.641 --> 22:56.609
Assholes gonna be doing some
messed-up shit around here.

22:56.643 --> 22:58.545
Come on, let's go.
We don't have time.

23:00.379 --> 23:01.347
(spits)

23:03.983 --> 23:06.553
You guys picked
the wrong place to rob.

23:06.586 --> 23:08.855
Now put the cases down.

23:08.888 --> 23:10.590
Put the cases down!

23:10.623 --> 23:12.725
Do what he says.

23:12.759 --> 23:14.093
Listen to your mom.

23:16.463 --> 23:19.532
Get in there and see what
kind of mess these guys made.

23:19.566 --> 23:22.469
I'ma call Gary and get
the boys over here.

23:22.502 --> 23:24.003
We're gonna have ourselves
a little fun.

23:24.871 --> 23:25.872
(chuckling)

23:28.074 --> 23:29.275
(gunshot)
(screams)

23:29.308 --> 23:30.610
Come on, get out of here! Go!

23:34.814 --> 23:35.782
Ugh!

23:37.450 --> 23:38.417
Ugh!

23:41.521 --> 23:43.656
Come on, let's go
before more show up. Come on.

23:43.690 --> 23:46.593
Here's a little piece of Mexico
to remember us by, puto.

23:46.626 --> 23:48.861
(screams)

23:48.895 --> 23:50.296
See you in church.

23:50.863 --> 23:52.699
(wailing)

24:03.242 --> 24:04.811
Armed men?

24:04.844 --> 24:06.579
Masks?

24:06.613 --> 24:08.314
There must be something more.

24:08.347 --> 24:10.382
I mean, as I told you, man,
that's all I saw.

24:10.416 --> 24:12.451
Someone grabbed Camila
when you had eyes on her.

24:12.485 --> 24:14.787
We got her those pills so we
could grab her at the hospital.

24:14.821 --> 24:16.523
Instead, you lost her.

24:16.556 --> 24:18.124
Is that what you're
telling me?

24:19.792 --> 24:21.928
(sighs) I mean...

24:21.961 --> 24:23.630
Camila has a lot
of enemies, right?

24:25.965 --> 24:28.200
Put word out in Culiacán.

24:28.234 --> 24:30.937
You find out if Boaz did this.

24:30.970 --> 24:33.272
If he did, it's war.

24:33.305 --> 24:35.141
If not...

24:35.174 --> 24:36.776
it's war with someone else.

24:38.678 --> 24:40.913
How about the cash
and the coke?

24:40.947 --> 24:42.214
We move now.

24:44.416 --> 24:47.887
But you follow my instructions
exactly like I tell you.

24:47.920 --> 24:48.855
Yes, sir.

24:50.590 --> 24:51.524
Get this loaded.

24:52.825 --> 24:54.493
Let's get these loaded up.

24:54.527 --> 24:56.462
(indistinct chatter)

25:02.835 --> 25:03.870
Okay.

25:03.903 --> 25:04.871
I got you.

25:11.010 --> 25:12.044
Guns look good.

25:14.013 --> 25:15.648
Big T approves the deal.

25:15.682 --> 25:17.950
When you're ready
to make a move,

25:17.984 --> 25:19.051
we're all good.

25:20.853 --> 25:22.521
Lil T's been bragging nonstop

25:22.555 --> 25:24.624
how you two assaulted
some Nazi pendejos.

25:24.657 --> 25:26.358
Her uncle's gonna
be hard-pressed

25:26.392 --> 25:28.027
trying to keep her out of shit
in the future.

25:29.696 --> 25:31.497
She's smart.

25:31.530 --> 25:33.165
I needed help.

25:33.199 --> 25:34.333
Just know...

25:34.366 --> 25:37.069
that shit's on your head.

25:37.103 --> 25:39.105
Kid is eager,
but she ain't hard yet.

25:39.138 --> 25:42.508
A boss is only as strong
as his weakest soldier.

25:42.541 --> 25:43.710
Unless...

25:46.378 --> 25:48.581
You got a badass number two.

25:49.882 --> 25:50.850
Like me.

25:53.886 --> 25:55.354
So what's up?

25:55.387 --> 25:56.756
You got a man, Mendoza?

25:56.789 --> 25:58.157
That's none of your business.

25:58.190 --> 26:00.359
It could be.

26:00.392 --> 26:02.328
Have your men ready.

26:02.361 --> 26:04.931
Once they move the product,
we go.

26:06.866 --> 26:07.800
Keep watch.

26:22.548 --> 26:24.116
Hey, Pote, it's me.

26:24.150 --> 26:25.752
Can you please call me back?

26:25.785 --> 26:27.887
I know you're angry, but...

26:27.920 --> 26:29.221
I really need your help.

26:31.758 --> 26:33.760
Bye.

26:33.793 --> 26:34.927
(phone buzzes)

26:36.829 --> 26:37.930
That was fast.

26:39.966 --> 26:41.600
Hey, beautiful.

26:41.634 --> 26:42.769
Don't hang up.

26:44.436 --> 26:46.739
-Where have you been?
-Pote told me you're in trouble.

26:46.773 --> 26:48.207
Listen to me, babe,

26:48.240 --> 26:49.175
you don't want to be
doing this.

26:49.208 --> 26:51.377
I have no choice.

26:51.410 --> 26:52.945
I'm trying to survive.

26:52.979 --> 26:55.147
Teresa, come on.

26:55.181 --> 26:56.182
Where are you?

26:58.617 --> 27:00.753
Taking care of that business
I told you about...

27:00.787 --> 27:02.021
in Culiacán.

27:02.054 --> 27:03.422
If Epifanio finds you in Mexico,

27:03.455 --> 27:05.091
he's gonna kill you.

27:05.124 --> 27:07.426
Yeah, well, it's Epifanio
needs to worry about me,

27:07.459 --> 27:08.795
not the other way around.

27:08.828 --> 27:10.129
What are you talking about?

27:10.162 --> 27:11.831
Look, I'm almost finished with

27:11.864 --> 27:13.632
what I'm doing down here,
and when I'm done,

27:13.666 --> 27:15.167
I'm heading back to Dallas
to get you, all right?

27:15.201 --> 27:16.635
Soon, just like I promised.
You hear me?

27:16.669 --> 27:18.637
Just... I need you
to stay safe.

27:18.671 --> 27:20.773
Hey, cue ball!

27:20.807 --> 27:22.174
Heard you cabrones
wanted some guns.

27:22.208 --> 27:24.110
Lil T provides, huh?

27:24.143 --> 27:26.312
All right? Just stay out
of trouble till I get there.

27:26.345 --> 27:27.413
Can you promise me that?

27:27.446 --> 27:28.915
Hey, they're moving!

27:28.948 --> 27:31.450
I can't.

27:34.320 --> 27:35.922
Let me see.

27:35.955 --> 27:36.923
See?

27:38.991 --> 27:41.027
But we don't know which car
has the product or the cash.

27:42.829 --> 27:44.731
Follow all three.
Let's go.

27:44.764 --> 27:45.932
Vamonos.

27:45.965 --> 27:47.599
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

27:47.633 --> 27:48.735
Pack that shit up!

27:50.336 --> 27:53.072
(suspenseful music)

27:53.105 --> 27:59.545
*

28:16.896 --> 28:18.497
Chucho, where are you?

28:18.530 --> 28:19.899
CHUCHO: I'm behind
the third SUV.

28:19.932 --> 28:22.301
I think I've been spotted.

28:22.334 --> 28:25.838
Good. Those trucks
were to distract us.

28:25.872 --> 28:27.539
James has the product,
not them.

28:27.573 --> 28:29.375
He knew I'd be watching
the warehouse.

28:29.408 --> 28:30.910
His first move is a decoy.

28:30.943 --> 28:37.984
*

28:38.885 --> 28:40.252
(phone buzzing)

28:44.556 --> 28:46.725
What do you want, Teresa?

28:46.759 --> 28:48.527
Half of the product
from El Santo,

28:48.560 --> 28:50.863
and half of the money
Devon gave you.

28:50.897 --> 28:52.164
You gave up claim to anything

28:52.198 --> 28:53.766
when you went after Camila.

28:53.800 --> 28:55.734
She gave me no choice.

28:55.768 --> 28:57.336
Could've walked away.

28:57.369 --> 28:59.005
I gave you that chance.

28:59.038 --> 29:01.173
I will ask you one more time.

29:01.207 --> 29:02.909
Give me my half.

29:02.942 --> 29:04.844
The only thing you get
from me is a bullet.

29:04.877 --> 29:05.878
Trust me.

29:10.950 --> 29:13.853
Seems like he's trying
to make this shit personal.

29:13.886 --> 29:15.254
It is personal.

29:18.524 --> 29:20.726
BIG T: He's bringing it
to a train yard?

29:20.759 --> 29:22.394
TERESA: It's smart.

29:22.428 --> 29:24.330
The DEA's watching
the roads and airports.

29:24.363 --> 29:28.300
Here, there's only
one guard to pay off.

29:28.334 --> 29:30.602
They think they lost us.

29:30.636 --> 29:32.471
They're not expecting
an attack.

29:33.505 --> 29:34.473
We go now.

29:39.946 --> 29:42.815
(suspenseful music)

29:42.849 --> 29:49.755
*

29:49.788 --> 29:53.425
WOMAN: * One way,
or another *

29:53.459 --> 29:55.962
* I'm gonna find ya

29:55.995 --> 29:59.431
*

29:59.465 --> 30:01.100
* One way, or another

30:01.133 --> 30:03.769
CHUCHO: Come on, let's go.

30:03.802 --> 30:06.505
WOMAN: * I'm gonna win ya

30:08.607 --> 30:10.376
-Now.
-Yeah.

30:10.409 --> 30:13.712
WOMAN:
* One way, maybe next week

30:13.745 --> 30:15.915
* I'm gonna meet ya

30:15.948 --> 30:22.955
*

30:25.324 --> 30:26.492
Don't pick it up!

30:29.761 --> 30:33.199
WOMAN: * One way, or another

30:33.232 --> 30:36.035
* I'm gonna lose ya

30:36.068 --> 30:39.838
*

30:39.872 --> 30:43.509
* One way, or another

30:43.542 --> 30:46.245
* I'm gonna lose ya

30:46.278 --> 30:49.181
* I'm gonna give you
the slip *

30:49.215 --> 30:54.486
* And if...

30:54.520 --> 30:58.490
* The lights are all out...

30:58.524 --> 30:59.525
We're blind out here.

30:59.558 --> 31:00.492
They're killing us!

31:00.526 --> 31:01.994
We need you now.

31:02.028 --> 31:03.996
Put your high beams on.
Point at them.

31:04.030 --> 31:05.464
Go!

31:05.497 --> 31:08.901
WOMAN: * Your bus downtown

31:08.935 --> 31:13.505
* See who's hangin' out

31:13.539 --> 31:20.546
*

31:46.905 --> 31:48.107
Where is she?

31:49.208 --> 31:51.577
-Who?
-Don't play games with me.

31:51.610 --> 31:52.644
Where is she?

31:52.678 --> 31:53.879
Camila?

31:53.912 --> 31:55.747
She trusted you.
I trusted you.

31:55.781 --> 31:57.216
Is that why you put
a tracking device

31:57.249 --> 31:59.018
on Tony's toy,
because of trust?

31:59.051 --> 32:00.752
Where is Camila?

32:00.786 --> 32:03.355
If I had her,
I would've traded her.

32:03.389 --> 32:05.257
Maybe you killed her.

32:05.291 --> 32:07.259
She betrayed me,
but I don't want her dead.

32:10.229 --> 32:11.563
I have an offer to make.

32:11.597 --> 32:14.133
We're past that now,
don't you think?

32:14.166 --> 32:17.036
I have El Santo, Devon,
and King George.

32:17.069 --> 32:18.437
Come work with us.

32:18.470 --> 32:20.406
I don't want to fight
against you.

32:20.439 --> 32:22.008
Let's fight together.

32:22.041 --> 32:23.609
Just yesterday you were
throwing up baggies

32:23.642 --> 32:25.211
of coke in an airport sink.

32:25.244 --> 32:27.213
And now you want me
to work for you?

32:27.246 --> 32:29.415
There's a better way of doing
this than the way she does.

32:29.448 --> 32:31.283
Without all this killing.

32:31.317 --> 32:33.752
That's not who you are.

32:33.785 --> 32:35.421
(scoffs)

32:35.454 --> 32:38.190
Whatever idea you've made up
in your head about me,

32:38.224 --> 32:39.458
you're wrong.

32:39.491 --> 32:40.926
You can't save me, Teresa.

32:40.959 --> 32:42.428
You can't save any of us.

32:42.461 --> 32:44.630
We can do a different way.

32:44.663 --> 32:45.998
Where none of us has to die.

32:50.102 --> 32:51.070
(gunshot)

32:55.707 --> 32:56.742
(grunts)

32:56.775 --> 32:59.745
(tense music)

32:59.778 --> 33:01.913
*

33:01.947 --> 33:03.482
POTE: Teresa!

33:03.515 --> 33:04.483
Whoa.

33:08.654 --> 33:10.089
We have to go after him.

33:10.122 --> 33:11.123
They'll go after him.

33:12.824 --> 33:14.260
You followed me.

33:14.293 --> 33:16.362
I wish I could say
it was harder.

33:17.696 --> 33:18.864
What about James and his men?

33:18.897 --> 33:19.865
They're gone.

33:20.832 --> 33:22.334
You won.

33:22.368 --> 33:24.236
The coke is yours.

33:24.270 --> 33:25.337
Just go.

33:26.838 --> 33:28.840
OLIVIA: Why isn't Pedro
letting us leave?

33:30.142 --> 33:31.443
It's been hours.

33:31.477 --> 33:33.445
We can't just sit here and wait

33:33.479 --> 33:35.781
until they decided whether
or not they're gonna kill us.

33:35.814 --> 33:37.716
Kill us?

33:37.749 --> 33:38.717
I didn't do anything.

33:40.486 --> 33:41.853
Hey, shh, shh, shh.

33:44.556 --> 33:46.058
I think he's leaving.

33:46.092 --> 33:47.659
Isabela, Olivia,
we have to go!

33:47.693 --> 33:49.328
No! If they catch you,
they'll kill us!

33:49.361 --> 33:50.996
-Look at the window.
-Bela, don't!

33:51.029 --> 33:51.963
(overlapping speech)

33:51.997 --> 33:53.665
They're escaping!

33:53.699 --> 33:56.068
(indistinct shouting)

33:58.504 --> 33:59.571
No! Stop it!

33:59.605 --> 34:01.707
-No!
-Leave me alone!

34:02.541 --> 34:05.977
Ahh. You in love with this
pretty boy, Princesa?

34:06.712 --> 34:08.580
No! No!

34:08.614 --> 34:10.216
You monster.

34:11.250 --> 34:12.851
PEDRO: I'm a monster?

34:12.884 --> 34:15.687
This pendejo's dad
killed my dad.

34:15.721 --> 34:16.988
Took everything from us.

34:17.022 --> 34:19.191
stole my father, stole my life.

34:20.659 --> 34:22.328
Stole all of our lives.

34:22.361 --> 34:23.595
You're a liar!

34:23.629 --> 34:25.231
(groans)

34:25.264 --> 34:26.465
PEDRO: You let your father
cut me off.

34:26.498 --> 34:28.400
I'll never forgive you for that.

34:28.434 --> 34:31.036
Now me and my family are
gonna receive $5 million,

34:31.069 --> 34:33.071
or I'm going to cut
both your throats.

34:33.105 --> 34:35.407
You know my dad won't
pay a dime for me, Pedro!

34:35.441 --> 34:38.144
Who said anything about
Boaz paying?

34:38.177 --> 34:40.746
Epifanio gave the order.

34:40.779 --> 34:42.881
But maybe money ain't
quite sweet enough revenge.

34:42.914 --> 34:44.950
No, no, no, cabron!
Don't touch her, Pedro!

34:44.983 --> 34:46.552
(screams) We're family!

34:46.585 --> 34:48.420
We grew up together! Please!

34:48.454 --> 34:50.256
(gasping)

34:50.289 --> 34:51.423
Pedro...

34:51.457 --> 34:52.924
you only want them.

34:53.925 --> 34:54.926
Can I please just go?

34:55.727 --> 34:56.762
KIQUE: This isn't you, man.

34:56.795 --> 34:58.464
Please, Pedro.

35:01.267 --> 35:02.201
(gunshot)

35:02.234 --> 35:04.069
Olivia, no!

35:04.102 --> 35:05.604
(gasping)

35:05.637 --> 35:07.105
No, no...

35:16.448 --> 35:18.484
Product is all here, but...

35:18.517 --> 35:20.386
we couldn't find any
money anywhere.

35:20.419 --> 35:22.721
James must have stashed it
somewhere else.

35:24.756 --> 35:27.025
It's okay. Just take it
to the drop-off on time.

35:27.058 --> 35:28.460
Everyone gets paid.

35:28.494 --> 35:29.461
Orale.

35:34.766 --> 35:36.034
POTE: I told you.

35:36.067 --> 35:37.169
You're no Camila.

35:37.203 --> 35:38.504
And I meant it.

35:40.272 --> 35:41.273
You're better.

35:42.741 --> 35:43.909
You got a heart.

35:59.491 --> 36:01.026
You got something to say,
Princesa?

36:01.860 --> 36:05.964
You stupid, pathetic
wannabe gangster.

36:06.732 --> 36:09.301
You think my father
ruined your life?

36:09.335 --> 36:13.339
I hate him more than
you can ever hope to.

36:13.372 --> 36:15.574
I'm not gonna ask him
for five million.

36:15.607 --> 36:17.008
I'm gonna ask him for ten.

36:17.042 --> 36:18.810
Kique and I get two

36:18.844 --> 36:21.513
and you and your cousins
get eight, and we go free.

36:21.547 --> 36:22.881
You want revenge?

36:22.914 --> 36:25.116
Be a man and do it yourself.

36:25.150 --> 36:26.785
You think you got
leverage, bitch?

36:26.818 --> 36:28.320
I'll kill you right now.

36:28.354 --> 36:29.988
And you don't get nothing.

36:30.021 --> 36:32.824
-Put me on tape.
-You think I'm stupid?

36:32.858 --> 36:36.027
My father won't pay you anything
unless he sees me alive.

36:36.061 --> 36:38.497
Put me on tape, I'll get you
your ten million.

36:38.530 --> 36:39.865
Then Kique and I go free.

36:39.898 --> 36:42.534
(tense music)

36:42.568 --> 36:45.571
*

36:48.206 --> 36:49.841
FEMALE ANNOUNCER:
Breaking news from Dallas.

36:49.875 --> 36:51.643
Federal authorities
are reporting

36:51.677 --> 36:53.979
that accused cartel leader
Camila Vargas

36:54.012 --> 36:56.181
was apparently broken out
of custody

36:56.214 --> 36:59.685
while en route to a high
security facility last night.

36:59.718 --> 37:01.787
For more on this story,
we turn to our reporter--

37:16.201 --> 37:18.470
(breathing heavily)

37:36.922 --> 37:39.458
I thought you sent Cortez
to do your dirty work.

37:41.259 --> 37:42.894
And here you are.

37:42.928 --> 37:44.296
Bravo, mi amor.

37:45.297 --> 37:47.232
Face to face in the end.

37:48.166 --> 37:50.001
Just like the man I always
knew you were.

37:51.036 --> 37:53.972
I didn't break you out of prison
to hurt you, Camila.

37:56.141 --> 37:58.710
Your daughter begged
for your life.

37:58.744 --> 38:00.712
I wanted to bring you
home to her.

38:00.746 --> 38:03.081
But now I have some, ah...

38:03.114 --> 38:04.650
some terrible news.

38:05.617 --> 38:07.686
Isabela.

38:07.719 --> 38:11.623
She told me she was going
to Oliva's family's house.

38:11.657 --> 38:15.060
A few hours ago,
I received this video.

38:18.263 --> 38:20.632
Mami, Papi,

38:20.666 --> 38:22.468
I'm in trouble.

38:22.501 --> 38:24.736
I've been kidnapped.

38:24.770 --> 38:27.238
I haven't been this scared
since I turned eight.

38:27.272 --> 38:28.907
CAMILA: We have to find her.

38:28.940 --> 38:31.142
EPIFANIO: If we attack,
they'll kill her.

38:31.176 --> 38:32.143
(sniffs)

38:35.213 --> 38:36.181
They will pay for this.

38:41.119 --> 38:42.754
Devon will pay $27 million

38:42.788 --> 38:44.222
for the other 900 kilos.

38:46.525 --> 38:48.259
Then we can pay El Santo

38:48.293 --> 38:49.895
and live another day.

38:49.928 --> 38:51.463
And you're gonna trust
the delivery

38:51.497 --> 38:53.765
to a bunch of street thugs?

38:53.799 --> 38:55.467
We have no choice.

38:55.501 --> 38:57.503
He uses separate locations
for product delivery

38:57.536 --> 38:58.504
and money drop-off.

38:59.871 --> 39:01.339
I need to be on
the money side.

39:05.811 --> 39:08.614
You could've gone, to keep
an eye on the product.

39:08.647 --> 39:10.449
You have too many
enemies tonight.

39:11.950 --> 39:14.486
Where you go, I go.

39:16.555 --> 39:17.523
Thank you.

39:18.990 --> 39:19.958
(tires screech)

39:19.991 --> 39:21.326
(speaking Spanish)

39:22.794 --> 39:26.097
(ominous music)

39:26.131 --> 39:27.132
*

39:27.165 --> 39:28.600
El Santo found me.

39:28.634 --> 39:30.001
I'm late with his payment.

39:32.504 --> 39:33.539
No weapons.

39:34.906 --> 39:36.174
I'm one of them.

39:36.875 --> 39:37.876
Remember?

39:37.909 --> 39:44.916
*
