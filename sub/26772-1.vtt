00:14.987 --> 00:16.820
- Hi, my name is Emma.

00:17.927 --> 00:22.471
I am looking for a very
special person in my life.

00:22.471 --> 00:24.266
I've been through it all.

00:24.266 --> 00:27.329
I've been dating for way too long.

00:27.329 --> 00:29.746
I've been with men and women.

00:31.876 --> 00:34.131
Tried that, didn't work out,

00:34.131 --> 00:37.131
so I'm done playing the dating game.

00:38.232 --> 00:41.990
I just want someone who
is going to be the perfect

00:41.990 --> 00:43.157
person for me.

00:45.741 --> 00:48.905
I'm not getting any younger.

00:48.905 --> 00:51.072
I just want happiness, and

00:54.230 --> 00:55.606
loved to have a family.

00:55.606 --> 00:58.773
So I am just giving this another shot,

01:00.430 --> 01:04.325
and I'm hoping that special
person is out there for me

01:04.325 --> 01:07.068
so we can make each other happy

01:07.068 --> 01:09.651
and give each other good lives.

03:35.203 --> 03:36.763
- Tada.
- Wow.

03:36.763 --> 03:39.760
This place is actually nice.

03:39.760 --> 03:41.622
I won't lie, I was
afraid that you might've

03:41.622 --> 03:43.846
brought me here just to
take me to your place.

03:43.846 --> 03:45.900
- Don't worry about it.

03:45.900 --> 03:48.033
Now I know what a big film buff you are.

03:48.033 --> 03:50.523
- Horror film buff.
- Yes, horror film buff.

03:50.523 --> 03:52.605
And I thought you'd like my home theater,

03:52.605 --> 03:55.243
and I've got a great
collection of short films.

03:55.243 --> 03:56.400
- Oh, nice.

03:56.400 --> 03:58.080
Well just so you know, I don't normally

03:58.080 --> 03:59.803
do this on the first date.

03:59.803 --> 04:03.667
But, you know, there's
something about you I trust.

04:03.667 --> 04:05.404
You wouldn't believe the
kind of dates I've been on

04:05.404 --> 04:08.642
through that dating site,
so I appreciate this.

04:08.642 --> 04:10.204
- I'm glad I don't disappoint.

04:10.204 --> 04:11.783
Tell you what, why don't you have a seat,

04:11.783 --> 04:12.616
I'm gonna grab us some popcorn.

04:12.616 --> 04:13.616
- Thank you.

04:25.460 --> 04:26.293
Thank you.

04:27.940 --> 04:29.413
So what do we got up first?

04:29.413 --> 04:30.274
- Oh, I figured to start,

04:30.274 --> 04:31.538
we'll do something a little lighter,

04:31.538 --> 04:33.954
a little g-rated family affair.

04:33.954 --> 04:35.571
- Hm.

04:35.571 --> 04:36.571
Nice.
- Yeah.

04:58.457 --> 05:00.778
- Welcome, boys and girls,

05:00.778 --> 05:04.945
to this week's episode of
Miss Catanic's Reading Room

05:06.874 --> 05:09.338
where you tell you to open a book.

05:09.338 --> 05:13.394
What have you got to lose
other than your soul?

05:15.280 --> 05:17.177
If you're following along at home,

05:17.177 --> 05:20.094
this week we're reading Doll Hands.

05:21.452 --> 05:25.291
And remember, when you hear this tone:

05:29.354 --> 05:30.521
turn the page.

05:35.033 --> 05:36.351
- There was a little girl

05:36.351 --> 05:37.973
named Samantha McKray.

05:37.973 --> 05:41.711
She hated the rules so she ran away.

05:46.415 --> 05:49.139
There was a little doll
named Pretty Miss Beth.

05:49.139 --> 05:53.306
She had pretty blue eyes
and a faint smell of death.

05:59.198 --> 06:01.778
Samantha had no idea where to go,

06:01.778 --> 06:05.695
she just wanted a place
to get out of the snow.

06:16.179 --> 06:18.835
Then she saw a building
that came into view.

06:18.835 --> 06:23.002
It looked really creepy,
but what else could she do?

06:31.320 --> 06:34.514
It had a roof made of wood
and walls make of bricks.

06:34.514 --> 06:38.681
It seemed like a place
where junkies get their fix.

06:52.397 --> 06:54.915
Samantha wanted to take
a quick look around.

06:54.915 --> 06:59.082
Beer cans, condoms and
needles littered the ground.

07:05.755 --> 07:08.659
Just as she was ready to
leave the way she came,

07:08.659 --> 07:13.118
Samantha heard a faint
voice calling her name.

07:16.977 --> 07:19.795
That's when she found her,
that little Miss Beth,

07:19.795 --> 07:24.755
with her pretty blue eyes
and her faint smell of death.

07:29.257 --> 07:31.198
"Please play with me," she said,

07:31.198 --> 07:32.819
"and I'll keep you safe.

07:32.819 --> 07:36.986
"I can be your best friend,
we can live in this place."

07:45.779 --> 07:48.537
They had a tea party
like princesses planned,

07:48.537 --> 07:52.454
ignoring that her cup
was just an old beer can.

08:05.254 --> 08:09.574
They played hide and go seek,
which Samantha always won.

08:09.574 --> 08:13.491
McKray's world had no
rules, now only good fun.

09:21.509 --> 09:24.172
Samantha ran down the
hall and into the light.

09:24.172 --> 09:27.755
The sun on her face
just didn't feel right.

09:41.421 --> 09:44.095
The cement pipes were used by those two

09:44.095 --> 09:46.845
for a wonderful game of peekaboo.

09:56.234 --> 09:59.789
But now Samantha felt
strange; something's wrong.

09:59.789 --> 10:03.372
The poltimous Beth was
a little too strong.

10:11.575 --> 10:15.132
Her skin became pale,
her brain began to hurt.

10:15.132 --> 10:19.049
Was this being caused by
the doll in the skirt?

10:26.674 --> 10:29.612
Samantha thought the only
way to stop feeling sick

10:29.612 --> 10:33.779
was to smash Little Miss
Beth's face with a brick.

10:50.957 --> 10:53.991
Samantha ran away from
home and look what it cost.

10:53.991 --> 10:57.574
She has no rules, but
her soul is now lost.

10:58.932 --> 11:02.612
Now she lives in this place,
surrounded by disrepair.

11:02.612 --> 11:07.092
Her hair is all matted
and her skin is so fair.

11:07.092 --> 11:09.388
She hopes to find a new friend to play,

11:09.388 --> 11:12.388
maybe a nice girl who just ran away.

11:18.448 --> 11:22.070
Maybe it's you, you can go there and see.

11:22.070 --> 11:25.653
Or maybe you will see
her and have to flee.

11:31.312 --> 11:34.032
There was a little girl
named Samantha McKray.

11:34.032 --> 11:37.032
She hated the rules so she ran away.

11:38.816 --> 11:41.575
There was a little doll
named Little Miss Beth.

11:41.575 --> 11:45.742
She had pretty blue eyes
and a faint smell of death.

12:05.214 --> 12:06.047
- Hm?

12:07.096 --> 12:10.386
Wasn't that kind of dark for children?

12:10.386 --> 12:12.560
Do you think that was appropriate?

12:12.560 --> 12:14.738
- Shouldn't children be made aware of

12:14.738 --> 12:16.679
the darkness that's in
the world around them?

12:16.679 --> 12:19.239
You know, maybe if we exposed
them more stuff like this,

12:19.239 --> 12:23.137
it'll prepare them for
what is in store for them.

12:23.137 --> 12:27.255
- Okay, but you're not
teaching them stranger danger,

12:27.255 --> 12:28.454
just say no to drugs.

12:28.454 --> 12:31.694
I mean, what kind of
lesson is practical here?

12:31.694 --> 12:35.355
I mean, how often do you see
someone turn into a doll?

12:35.355 --> 12:37.240
- Think of it more of a cautionary tale,

12:37.240 --> 12:38.873
you know, like the Grimm
Brothers used to do

12:38.873 --> 12:40.633
but with a modern twist.

12:40.633 --> 12:42.953
It's funny how many of our modern fears

12:42.953 --> 12:44.600
stem from childhood issues.

12:44.600 --> 12:47.267
You know, like clowns and dolls.

12:48.372 --> 12:50.691
- You know, I've never
been afraid of clowns.

12:50.691 --> 12:53.858
- You've just never met the right one.

13:07.633 --> 13:09.092
- Hey, dude.

13:09.092 --> 13:11.924
There's a new haunted
house attraction in town.

13:11.924 --> 13:15.636
It's only like 10 bucks
a head. Do you wanna go?

13:15.636 --> 13:18.014
- I don't believe in ghosts, dude.

13:18.014 --> 13:21.350
- Well, you don't have
to believe in ghosts

13:21.350 --> 13:23.374
to enjoy a haunted house.

13:23.374 --> 13:24.916
- Kinda do.

13:24.916 --> 13:26.414
- Yeah, you kinda fuckin' don't.

13:26.414 --> 13:28.610
You're playing a fuckin' game right now

13:28.610 --> 13:30.799
where you're shooting a
bunch of fuckin' aliens--

13:30.799 --> 13:33.574
- But I'm not like you
where I think the aliens

13:33.574 --> 13:35.777
are real and gonna come
out of the TV or something,

13:35.777 --> 13:37.836
like all your conspiracy
theories and stuff.

13:37.836 --> 13:38.669
- Oh my God.

13:38.669 --> 13:41.795
Just because it's proven by the government

13:41.795 --> 13:44.075
that chem trails are
real, doesn't fuckin' mean

13:44.075 --> 13:45.970
that aliens are real.

13:45.970 --> 13:47.801
- I do not want to go to
this stupid haunted house.

13:47.801 --> 13:49.884
Oh my God. Whatever, man.

13:53.053 --> 13:57.220
Do you wanna hear something
that's actually scary?

13:58.232 --> 13:59.612
- Sure.

13:59.612 --> 14:04.093
- Alright, so the story goes
is that there's this clown,

14:04.093 --> 14:07.151
his name is Socko, Socko the Clown.

14:20.236 --> 14:22.736
So Socko was born Nathan Sins.

14:25.854 --> 14:28.271
Nathan was bullied in school.

14:32.517 --> 14:33.935
He would go home and his parents would

14:33.935 --> 14:36.018
never notice he's around.

14:38.710 --> 14:41.286
One year they hired a birthday
clown for his birthday,

14:41.286 --> 14:43.055
and since no one else
showed up, the clown was

14:43.055 --> 14:46.388
the only one to spend the birthday with.

14:48.857 --> 14:51.895
From that point, Nathan
knew what he wanted to be.

14:51.895 --> 14:53.791
He was going to be a
party clown and bring joy

14:53.791 --> 14:58.232
to all the children who had
no other joy in their life.

14:58.232 --> 14:59.478
After waiting his entire life,

14:59.478 --> 15:02.439
he finally got his first clown job.

15:02.439 --> 15:03.522
He was Socko.

15:05.436 --> 15:07.017
The parents that hired him didn't realize

15:07.017 --> 15:09.111
that the 12-year-old
child that his friends

15:09.111 --> 15:12.036
were way to old for a birthday clown.

15:12.036 --> 15:15.715
So Socko was best to
entertain these preteens,

15:15.715 --> 15:18.059
and they were having none of it.

15:18.059 --> 15:20.457
And they are throwing things at him

15:20.457 --> 15:22.457
and calling him all kinds
of named like douche

15:22.457 --> 15:24.596
and greasy pervert.

15:24.596 --> 15:27.670
And one of the kids yells
out Sucko the Clown.

15:27.670 --> 15:29.535
All the other kids pick up on it.

15:29.535 --> 15:30.992
So the next think you
know, they're chanting

15:30.992 --> 15:32.825
"Sucko, Sucko, Sucko!"

15:34.753 --> 15:36.732
Socko was devastated
by this and walks away

15:36.732 --> 15:38.149
to the other room

15:39.351 --> 15:41.831
where he finds the
parents' liquor cabinet.

15:41.831 --> 15:46.647
He just starts downing
whiskey like it's his job,

15:46.647 --> 15:48.850
and then stumbles into his clown car

15:48.850 --> 15:50.791
and tries to drive home.

15:50.791 --> 15:54.958
On his way home, he crashes
head into a bridge.

15:56.013 --> 15:57.690
When the story hit the
news, the anchors were

15:57.690 --> 15:59.891
unable to keep a straight face,

15:59.891 --> 16:02.808
and the entire incident went viral.

16:04.109 --> 16:05.616
Even the fact that he died in an accident

16:05.616 --> 16:08.828
didn't stop people from making fun of him.

16:08.828 --> 16:11.049
Then on the anniversary of his death,

16:11.049 --> 16:14.668
a teenager was found brutally
murdered in his bathroom.

16:14.668 --> 16:16.849
The teenager's friend said
they were looking in the mirror

16:16.849 --> 16:20.407
and said Sucko the Clown three times.

16:20.407 --> 16:23.047
The next thing they knew, Socko was there

16:23.047 --> 16:25.763
with a knife and killed his friend.

16:25.763 --> 16:27.271
To this day, if you look into a mirror

16:27.271 --> 16:29.207
and say Sucko the Clown three times,

16:29.207 --> 16:32.124
he'll show up and take his revenge.

16:42.407 --> 16:44.145
- You do not actually believe that.

16:44.145 --> 16:46.441
- I swear to God. I--

16:46.441 --> 16:48.508
- You believe that if you go in the mirror

16:48.508 --> 16:51.091
and say his name three
times, he'll show up?

16:51.091 --> 16:53.319
- Fuckin' yes, dude.

16:55.039 --> 16:56.879
Alright, dude, oh I'll tell you what,

16:56.879 --> 16:59.269
I will get off your back about going,

16:59.269 --> 17:01.759
leaving the house,
putting down your fuckin'

17:01.759 --> 17:04.223
space marine video game bullshit--

17:04.223 --> 17:06.041
- Oh my god.

17:06.041 --> 17:08.259
- And going to the haunted house

17:08.259 --> 17:12.557
if you go and do this with me
right now in your bathroom.

17:12.557 --> 17:16.239
- So if I go in there and
I say his name three times,

17:16.239 --> 17:18.901
and he doesn't show up,

17:18.901 --> 17:21.377
like literally he does not show up,

17:21.377 --> 17:26.357
no lights flickering or any
of that wind-blowing nonsense

17:26.357 --> 17:28.189
like last time, then I don't have to go

17:28.189 --> 17:29.986
to this haunted house?

17:29.986 --> 17:31.403
- Swear, I swear.

17:32.589 --> 17:33.422
- Alright.

17:34.589 --> 17:35.920
- Alright, let's do it.

17:35.920 --> 17:38.327
- So just say Sucko the Clown
in the mirror three times?

17:38.327 --> 17:41.047
- Yeah, dude, if you're not scared.

17:41.047 --> 17:42.665
- It's stupid.

17:42.665 --> 17:45.044
- If it's so stupid, just fuckin' do it.

17:45.044 --> 17:46.224
- I'm not scared either.

17:46.224 --> 17:48.381
Alright, c'mon. Prove it.

17:48.381 --> 17:50.048
- Sucko the Clown...

17:51.266 --> 17:54.016
Sucko the Clown, Sucko the Clown.

17:55.026 --> 17:57.776
Oh God!

18:09.446 --> 18:10.529
- It's Socko.

18:12.841 --> 18:14.424
It's fuckin' Socko.

18:20.702 --> 18:22.859
- That was interesting.

18:22.859 --> 18:25.123
- You know, most people see
the clown as the villain,

18:25.123 --> 18:27.945
but wasn't he really the victim here?

18:27.945 --> 18:30.121
First society, then his parents,

18:30.121 --> 18:31.881
and then the children
he wanted nothing more

18:31.881 --> 18:33.641
than to entertain.

18:33.641 --> 18:35.982
Now he's forced into an
existence where he has to

18:35.982 --> 18:38.149
show up whenever beckoned.

18:39.662 --> 18:41.768
- I guess I didn't see it that way.

18:41.768 --> 18:43.351
Hm. What a tragedy.

18:45.787 --> 18:49.954
Well I don't suppose you
have any horror/love stories.

18:52.706 --> 18:55.546
- I do have a story, I do
have a beautiful story,

18:55.546 --> 18:58.296
about love that can't be stopped.

19:23.768 --> 19:27.101
♫ Marty Love is a loser

19:29.506 --> 19:33.673
♫ Everything goes wrong in his life

19:35.230 --> 19:38.328
♫ His apartment's trashed

19:38.328 --> 19:41.550
♫ He's always about to crash

19:41.550 --> 19:45.300
♫ Nowhere near having a wife

19:47.534 --> 19:51.701
♫ It's vodka and coffee in the morning

19:53.326 --> 19:57.493
♫ Whatever it takes to
get him through the day

19:59.406 --> 20:02.325
♫ He drags his bag out the door

20:02.325 --> 20:05.322
♫ To work another 8 to 4

20:05.322 --> 20:09.489
♫ It's like he's living his life away

20:11.470 --> 20:14.910
♫ Find a note when he
gets back that evening

20:14.910 --> 20:17.608
♫ With a gift he didn't plan on receiving

20:17.608 --> 20:20.766
♫ Someone named Rose knows what he needs

20:20.766 --> 20:24.933
♫ His heart keeps beating as he reads

20:27.267 --> 20:31.434
♫ Sometimes the reason we feel so lonely

20:33.608 --> 20:37.775
♫ In this life is 'cause we haven't found

20:39.806 --> 20:43.889
♫ The other half of our soul now

20:46.070 --> 20:50.237
♫ So give this record a spin around

21:07.023 --> 21:11.190
♫ As the record turns,
the ghost of Rose appears

21:14.047 --> 21:18.214
♫ Swaying to the music like
it's all that she can hear

21:21.226 --> 21:25.393
♫ Each move seduces Marty
like she's melting eyes

21:28.370 --> 21:32.537
♫ She motions to the bedroom
but he doesn't think twice

21:47.209 --> 21:51.126
♫ Marty wakes the next morning

21:53.228 --> 21:57.395
♫ Seizes the day like a different man

21:59.250 --> 22:02.871
♫ His apartment's clean

22:02.871 --> 22:05.708
♫ Feel so pristine

22:05.708 --> 22:09.875
♫ Now that he has Rose who understands

22:12.268 --> 22:16.435
♫ Breakfast is on the table waiting

22:18.311 --> 22:22.478
♫ The windows open, fan in the breeze

22:24.572 --> 22:27.932
♫ His life feels less like reality

22:27.932 --> 22:31.050
♫ And he thinks, oh this is fine with me

22:31.050 --> 22:35.217
♫ 'Cause I am finally living the dream

22:37.308 --> 22:41.475
♫ You saw him finally living the dream

22:48.452 --> 22:52.619
♫ Marty heads to work and on his way home

22:54.530 --> 22:58.697
♫ He stops to celebrate this life he owns

23:01.194 --> 23:05.361
♫ Bumps into his friend as she walks in

23:07.395 --> 23:11.562
♫ So they catch up about
how things have been

23:13.903 --> 23:18.070
♫ He things of Rose as he grabs his plate

23:20.402 --> 23:24.569
♫ Feels a little guilty
for making her wait

23:26.882 --> 23:30.558
♫ I hope she won't mind that he'll be late

23:42.619 --> 23:46.786
♫ But Rose got worried
when he didn't show up

23:48.477 --> 23:52.644
♫ So she went out looking,
looking for her love

23:54.656 --> 23:57.898
♫ But when Rose saw them there

23:57.898 --> 24:01.063
♫ She could just fume and stare

24:01.063 --> 24:05.230
♫ How could that bastard
dare to fuck this all up

24:13.317 --> 24:17.484
♫ When Marty gets home,
his place is a mess

24:19.679 --> 24:23.846
♫ It's covered in
notes with angry threats

24:26.020 --> 24:30.187
♫ The record is spinning, it's
playing that same old song

24:32.564 --> 24:36.731
♫ He sees Rose crying
like a woman done wrong

24:38.980 --> 24:41.901
♫ Her eyes glare

24:41.901 --> 24:44.568
♫ Her eyes burn

24:45.454 --> 24:48.787
♫ As that record turned

24:51.603 --> 24:55.082
♫ As Marty looks around, he sees the thorn

24:55.082 --> 24:57.583
♫ Of a woman scorned

24:57.583 --> 25:00.779
♫ She's crying, she's
lying, she's trying to

25:00.779 --> 25:03.978
♫ Get him cornered

25:03.978 --> 25:07.364
♫ She feels bad for what she did

25:07.364 --> 25:10.542
♫ Wants to make it up with love to him

25:10.542 --> 25:14.709
♫ But all that Marty can say is no

25:15.903 --> 25:18.486
♫ No, Rose, no

25:25.700 --> 25:28.602
♫ He decides to destroy the record

25:28.602 --> 25:31.859
♫ Let this new life drop

25:31.859 --> 25:35.434
♫ So the maniacal musical madness

25:35.434 --> 25:39.601
♫ Will finally stop

25:44.321 --> 25:45.893
♫ There is peace for a moment

25:45.893 --> 25:50.060
♫ But Rose flies back like a hornet

25:51.254 --> 25:53.894
♫ Menacing, with a knife in the air

25:53.894 --> 25:58.061
♫ Marty runs for his life but
breaks his neck right there

26:14.492 --> 26:18.659
♫ Marty rises from his resting place

26:20.273 --> 26:24.023
♫ To see an old familiar sin

26:26.230 --> 26:29.413
♫ A past life with his Rose

26:29.413 --> 26:32.492
♫ For they

26:32.492 --> 26:36.659
♫ Red wine in cold

26:50.353 --> 26:53.372
♫ As dying together

26:53.372 --> 26:56.308
♫ Seems so much better

26:56.308 --> 26:59.397
♫ Yet dying together

26:59.397 --> 27:02.980
♫ Seems so much better, oh

27:06.937 --> 27:09.520
♫ Living alone

27:32.933 --> 27:34.709
- That was so beautiful.

27:34.709 --> 27:38.912
I mean, they had a love that
even death couldn't stop.

27:38.912 --> 27:41.189
You know, sometimes,

27:41.189 --> 27:43.451
a love can be too strong.

27:43.451 --> 27:46.289
When that happens, it
becomes an obsession.

27:46.289 --> 27:49.206
And that is a special kind of love.

28:00.832 --> 28:02.248
I started coming here

28:02.248 --> 28:03.973
after the accident.

28:03.973 --> 28:06.751
If I couldn't hear the beauty
this world had to offer,

28:06.751 --> 28:08.870
at least I could see it.

28:08.870 --> 28:10.932
I spent my days walking through this park

28:10.932 --> 28:12.682
enjoying the silence.

28:40.062 --> 28:42.131
It took a while getting
used to my sound-proof

28:42.131 --> 28:44.018
cage of deafness.

28:44.018 --> 28:45.581
Months of counseling and recovery

28:45.581 --> 28:48.919
stretched on for what
seemed like an eternity.

28:48.919 --> 28:51.454
Sign language and lip
reading were little comforts

28:51.454 --> 28:54.255
within depression's cruel embrace.

28:54.255 --> 28:57.005
That's when she entered my world.

29:02.830 --> 29:05.249
I noticed her in passing at first.

29:05.249 --> 29:06.793
But soon I started looking forward

29:06.793 --> 29:08.774
to when she'd come in my room.

29:08.774 --> 29:10.210
She was an aide,

29:10.210 --> 29:13.014
helping to change my bandages and linens.

29:13.014 --> 29:16.835
It was because of her that
my eternity became bearable.

29:16.835 --> 29:20.224
I could no longer hear, but
her smile was a symphony.

29:20.224 --> 29:24.307
And her touch would make
a chorus of angels weep.

29:30.996 --> 29:33.579
Sent home, I felt my loss anew.

29:34.755 --> 29:37.194
It was like living in
the depths of the earth.

29:37.194 --> 29:39.749
No sound, no light without her.

29:39.749 --> 29:41.512
The hospital released me,

29:41.512 --> 29:44.762
but my heart would remain forever hers.

30:06.036 --> 30:09.050
She was my savior, my goddess,

30:09.050 --> 30:11.892
and every goddess needs her shrine.

30:11.892 --> 30:16.059
Perhaps one day she will see
it, and she will love me.

30:43.003 --> 30:44.707
I have gone to thank her,

30:44.707 --> 30:46.747
to tell her what she means to me.

30:46.747 --> 30:48.503
I've approached the hospital,

30:48.503 --> 30:51.969
but like a frightened rabbit,
I ran before she saw me.

30:51.969 --> 30:54.886
What kind of weirdo stalks someone?

31:08.028 --> 31:09.747
I followed her here.

31:09.747 --> 31:12.711
She likes to come here
everyday after work.

31:12.711 --> 31:16.878
It's not stalking if we visit
the same public park, is it?

31:23.768 --> 31:26.024
I've seen her in the
months since coming here,

31:26.024 --> 31:28.049
always from the shadows.

31:28.049 --> 31:29.868
I can't have her spot me yet.

31:29.868 --> 31:32.868
Would she even recognize me, though?

31:45.609 --> 31:47.628
Her kindness radiates through her

31:47.628 --> 31:49.468
like the warmth of the sun.

31:49.468 --> 31:52.151
As she passes, I see men turn and leer,

31:52.151 --> 31:55.290
their filthy intentions
plain on their faces.

31:55.290 --> 31:57.889
She greets them all
with a wave and a smile,

31:57.889 --> 32:00.889
oblivious to their intended cruelty.

32:07.111 --> 32:11.148
She's too pure, a goddess
made into porcelain flesh.

32:11.148 --> 32:13.671
One wrong move and she'll be broken.

32:13.671 --> 32:15.212
I can't let that happen.

32:15.212 --> 32:18.028
She will thank me. She
will be happy with me.

32:18.028 --> 32:19.907
I can treat her the way she needs,

32:19.907 --> 32:21.657
the way she deserves.

32:24.748 --> 32:27.068
That is why I must do this today.

32:27.068 --> 32:30.871
Even now as I follow her, I
feel the darkness receding,

32:30.871 --> 32:33.852
going back into a long-forgotten
portion of my mind.

32:33.852 --> 32:36.748
I have to be careful, take my time,

32:36.748 --> 32:39.612
choose the right moment to grab her.

33:21.127 --> 33:23.708
This might be the opportunity that I need.

33:23.708 --> 33:26.964
The tunnels under this
bridge are pretty secluded.

33:26.964 --> 33:28.290
What is she taking out of the,

33:28.290 --> 33:30.123
oh no, did she see me?

33:31.826 --> 33:33.326
I have to act now.

34:32.859 --> 34:34.902
- I wouldn't consider that love.

34:34.902 --> 34:37.178
He tried to kidnap her.

34:37.178 --> 34:38.954
- He was misguided on how to show it,

34:38.954 --> 34:40.179
but it was still love.

34:40.179 --> 34:43.096
- If you say so.

34:43.096 --> 34:45.802
- It was just, it just
consumed him, is all,

34:45.802 --> 34:48.123
and then so did the
creature in the forest.

34:49.800 --> 34:51.440
You know, many people
think that love is just

34:51.440 --> 34:53.521
a chemical reaction in your brain.

34:53.521 --> 34:55.500
The same chemical reaction that makes you

34:55.500 --> 34:58.718
question everything that
you thought was once life.

34:58.718 --> 35:00.821
Now, I myself think that the loss of love

35:00.821 --> 35:04.124
that was once there is the
most tragic story of all.

35:04.124 --> 35:04.957
- Aw.

35:29.818 --> 35:31.135
- This
is the day I've been

35:31.135 --> 35:33.180
dreaming about, living off the grid

35:33.180 --> 35:35.124
from all the hatred and insanity

35:35.124 --> 35:37.662
that this world seems to have embraced.

35:37.662 --> 35:40.628
The only thing that makes
this day better than my dreams

35:40.628 --> 35:43.305
is that I'm here with
the woman that I love.

35:43.305 --> 35:46.462
Together, we can start
our lives on our terms,

35:46.462 --> 35:49.212
not what was dictated by society.

35:55.502 --> 35:57.465
- Day one.

35:57.465 --> 35:59.262
Scott asked me to keep a journal so we

35:59.262 --> 36:01.290
can document our new lives together.

36:01.290 --> 36:04.268
I think that this is
the best thing for us.

36:04.268 --> 36:06.652
I love how clean everything is out here.

36:06.652 --> 36:09.818
I'll miss the smell of
cheerios that the city had,

36:09.818 --> 36:11.904
but I won't miss having
to fill water pitchers

36:11.904 --> 36:13.349
just to have clean water.

36:13.349 --> 36:16.516
The spring is so crisp and clean here.

36:20.907 --> 36:22.507
Day five.

36:22.507 --> 36:25.804
I'm surprised at how little
I miss about our old lives.

36:25.804 --> 36:28.006
There are times I do miss
our friends and family,

36:28.006 --> 36:30.027
but I'm comforted in knowing that I can go

36:30.027 --> 36:32.188
and visit them whenever I want.

36:32.188 --> 36:33.926
Scott told me that I should wait until

36:33.926 --> 36:36.886
we've been here for a while
before we invite anyone over,

36:36.886 --> 36:41.053
just to make sure we're
acclimating to our new lives.

36:45.411 --> 36:48.470
- Day ten.
We walked our land today.

36:48.470 --> 36:51.547
I can tell Linda misses some
aspects of our old life.

36:51.547 --> 36:53.267
I wish there was more that I could do

36:53.267 --> 36:56.445
to help her forget all
that we left behind.

36:56.445 --> 36:59.629
Our old lives brought us nothing but pain.

36:59.629 --> 37:01.324
I would give anything to make sure

37:01.324 --> 37:03.914
she never feels that pain again.

37:03.914 --> 37:05.793
She needs to realize that I am the only

37:05.793 --> 37:07.376
family she has now.

37:18.824 --> 37:20.508
- Day 23.

37:20.508 --> 37:22.561
I don't understand why Scott is so adamant

37:22.561 --> 37:24.791
about me not visiting my family.

37:24.791 --> 37:28.049
Today he told me the weather
wasn't good for travel.

37:28.049 --> 37:29.848
I know my parents
weren't his biggest fans,

37:29.848 --> 37:31.788
but they came around.

37:31.788 --> 37:33.068
How will they ever make it up to him

37:33.068 --> 37:35.235
if he refuses to see them?

37:48.489 --> 37:49.322
Day 27.

37:50.223 --> 37:52.659
I think this isolation is getting to me.

37:52.659 --> 37:54.304
Last night when I looked out the window,

37:54.304 --> 37:56.949
I saw something in the wood line.

37:56.949 --> 37:58.683
Some kind of entity out there,

37:58.683 --> 38:00.491
just far enough away that I couldn't tell

38:00.491 --> 38:02.571
exactly what it is.

38:02.571 --> 38:05.191
I would tell Scott but he
seems annoyed with me lately,

38:05.191 --> 38:08.524
and I don't want him thinking I'm crazy.

38:20.649 --> 38:22.287
- Day 27.

38:22.287 --> 38:24.985
I think it is time I told Linda the truth.

38:24.985 --> 38:28.308
I have tried to let her work
it all out on her own time.

38:28.308 --> 38:30.501
I thought by now she would have accepted

38:30.501 --> 38:32.868
that I am all she has left.

38:32.868 --> 38:34.847
She refuses to let go of the past

38:34.847 --> 38:37.391
and embrace what her life is now.

38:37.391 --> 38:39.625
She seems to be getting worse.

38:39.625 --> 38:43.323
Last night, she got spooked by
something outside the window.

38:43.323 --> 38:47.490
I asked her what she saw, but
she told me it was nothing.

39:02.645 --> 39:04.304
- Day 40.

39:04.304 --> 39:06.747
I know now that this was a mistake.

39:06.747 --> 39:10.288
Scott brought me out here,
took me away from my parents,

39:10.288 --> 39:12.827
the only people who loved me.

39:12.827 --> 39:15.568
I have to be strong and
find a way to escape.

39:15.568 --> 39:18.805
I've realized what the entity
was that I saw the other day.

39:18.805 --> 39:21.227
It's clearly Scott's accomplice.

39:21.227 --> 39:23.328
I see that thing every night now

39:23.328 --> 39:25.664
patrolling the area.

39:25.664 --> 39:27.958
It's there to make sure
I can't leave Scott.

39:27.958 --> 39:29.787
That's why, when I told him what I saw,

39:29.787 --> 39:32.027
he told me he didn't see anything.

39:32.027 --> 39:34.005
I've stopped letting
him know when I see it.

39:34.005 --> 39:36.755
I can't let him know that I know.

39:51.568 --> 39:53.086
Day 45.

39:53.086 --> 39:55.328
I've begun hoarding away food.

39:55.328 --> 39:57.488
Once I think I have enough
supplies to make my escape,

39:57.488 --> 39:58.822
I'll do so.

39:58.822 --> 40:01.952
Scott's watchdog, the
thing out in the woods,

40:01.952 --> 40:03.845
it's been getting braver.

40:03.845 --> 40:06.288
Every time I see it now, it's come closer.

40:06.288 --> 40:08.768
They must have such a
low perception of me.

40:08.768 --> 40:11.328
They think I'm too weak to fight back.

40:11.328 --> 40:14.995
That I'm too stupid to
see what's happening.

40:19.088 --> 40:20.369
- Day 50.

40:20.369 --> 40:22.048
I am worried about Linda.

40:22.048 --> 40:24.384
She has been acting so distant.

40:24.384 --> 40:26.505
I hope she realizes how much I love her

40:26.505 --> 40:28.903
and how all of this is for her.

40:28.903 --> 40:30.746
I found a bag filled with food today

40:30.746 --> 40:32.428
that she had been hiding.

40:32.428 --> 40:35.445
When I asked her about
it, she had a meltdown.

40:35.445 --> 40:39.468
She kept saying something
about me and my friend.

40:39.468 --> 40:42.225
I think she's had a break.

40:42.225 --> 40:44.828
Maybe it's time I told her the truth.

40:44.828 --> 40:47.328
It has to be better than this.

40:52.508 --> 40:54.446
- Day 52.

40:54.446 --> 40:55.985
It's becoming more and more difficult

40:55.985 --> 40:58.188
to act like everything's okay,

40:58.188 --> 41:01.825
to go about such mundane,
day-to-day routines.

41:01.825 --> 41:04.508
I think Scott knows I plan on escaping.

41:04.508 --> 41:06.591
He won't be able to stop me.

41:06.591 --> 41:07.868
I need to escape.

41:07.868 --> 41:11.535
It has to happen. I
can't take this anymore.

41:13.068 --> 41:13.901
Day 55.

41:15.127 --> 41:17.203
Scott found my escape bag.

41:17.203 --> 41:20.324
He's now getting so
desperate to keep me here.

41:20.324 --> 41:22.465
He told me that my parents are dead,

41:22.465 --> 41:24.508
that they died in an accident.

41:24.508 --> 41:26.247
I told him I'm not stupid.

41:26.247 --> 41:28.046
I would remember that.

41:28.046 --> 41:30.225
He said it was a mental breakdown.

41:30.225 --> 41:32.247
According to him, my doctor told him

41:32.247 --> 41:34.268
that moving out here would help me.

41:34.268 --> 41:37.105
That he should let me work it out myself.

41:37.105 --> 41:40.780
I am not crazy. He wants
me to doubt myself.

41:40.780 --> 41:43.741
I will not be controlled. Tonight I leave.

41:43.741 --> 41:47.908
His friend is getting too
close, it's tonight or never.

42:07.447 --> 42:08.744
- Agent Bidwater,

42:08.744 --> 42:10.567
government.

42:10.567 --> 42:13.287
The experiment was a success.

42:13.287 --> 42:15.308
Adding the agent to the water supply

42:15.308 --> 42:17.425
increased paranoia in the residents

42:17.425 --> 42:19.633
turning them against each other.

42:19.633 --> 42:22.663
I was able to attain all
the information necessary

42:22.663 --> 42:26.163
to begin using the agent
against foreign governments.

42:26.163 --> 42:28.065
A cleanup team has been dispatched

42:28.065 --> 42:31.127
to round up the female
and destroy all evidence.

42:31.127 --> 42:32.748
When we win the war,

42:32.748 --> 42:35.287
they will be the first unsung heroes,

42:35.287 --> 42:37.879
like the first monkeys shot into space.

42:37.879 --> 42:40.296
They will usher in a new era.

42:46.065 --> 42:47.905
- That is so sad.

42:47.905 --> 42:50.567
They thought they could
escape the world and run away

42:50.567 --> 42:51.817
and be in love.

42:54.028 --> 42:55.866
You know what, I don't think I can watch

42:55.866 --> 42:57.761
anymore love stories.

42:57.761 --> 43:00.295
- Okay. We could switch gears.

43:00.295 --> 43:02.359
How about a classic superhero tale?

43:02.359 --> 43:05.294
Hey, have you ever
heard of Johnny Justice?

43:05.294 --> 43:06.773
- No. Who's that?

43:06.773 --> 43:09.038
- He was my favorite superhero
when I was growing up.

43:09.038 --> 43:12.116
Yeah, I had a huge collection
of his memorabilia.

43:12.116 --> 43:15.783
And this is my favorite
episode of the show.

43:18.092 --> 43:21.174
- There
he is, Johnny Justice.

43:21.174 --> 43:23.817
Saving the world, protecting puppies,

43:23.817 --> 43:26.173
helping innocent babies,

43:26.173 --> 43:28.776
all so he can sign a few autographs.

43:28.776 --> 43:31.678
Well now it's time to help
me out, Johnny Justice,

43:31.678 --> 43:34.112
you arrogant son of a bitch.

43:34.112 --> 43:36.137
You're gonna help me home,

43:36.137 --> 43:38.220
and I don't think you're gonna like

43:38.220 --> 43:42.220
what it takes for me to
go home, are ya, Johnny?

43:44.212 --> 43:47.377
- Remember, ladies, you can
take justice in your own hands.

45:56.505 --> 45:58.203
- Last we
left our valiant hero,

45:58.203 --> 46:00.805
he was in the clutches of the foul fiend,

46:00.805 --> 46:02.705
Doctor Devastation.

46:02.705 --> 46:07.442
How will our helpless hero
escape this perilous predicament?

46:07.442 --> 46:09.626
- You will not get away with
this, Doctor Devastation.

46:09.626 --> 46:11.722
We both know how this will end.

46:11.722 --> 46:13.889
- My name is Kevin.
- What?

46:16.922 --> 46:19.099
- My name is Kevin.

46:19.099 --> 46:21.599
You know, I saved you for last

46:22.506 --> 46:26.005
because you retired and I didn't
think I'd have to kill you.

46:26.005 --> 46:30.762
But obviously I need to
kill you to make it stop.

46:30.762 --> 46:32.645
- You don't win this, Devastation.

46:32.645 --> 46:34.303
I am the, what the fuck!

46:34.303 --> 46:38.342
I'm the hero, I'm
supposed to win, not you!

46:38.342 --> 46:41.643
- I need you to listen, I
need you to focus on my words,

46:41.643 --> 46:43.601
'cause I'm not a bad guy.

46:43.601 --> 46:46.603
I just, this is not my fault.

46:46.603 --> 46:49.436
What I do, I do because I have to.

46:54.241 --> 46:56.440
My name's Kevin, Kevin Wallace.

46:56.440 --> 46:58.305
You know, I'm not from this world.

46:58.305 --> 47:00.625
The world I'm from, heroes and villains,

47:00.625 --> 47:03.425
they're not real, they're TV shows.

47:03.425 --> 47:06.422
I grew up watching the
Johnny Justice Power Hour.

47:06.422 --> 47:09.755
Hell, one year, I was you for Halloween.

47:11.760 --> 47:14.465
I lived in a world where I was a doctor.

47:14.465 --> 47:16.878
I had a wife and a
child, and then one day,

47:16.878 --> 47:18.065
I wake up and I'm here.

47:18.065 --> 47:21.302
I can hear narrators speaking about every

47:21.302 --> 47:23.922
little mundane thing that you do.

47:23.922 --> 47:26.321
I can see the cameras and the lights

47:26.321 --> 47:28.582
that you guys are oblivious to.

47:28.582 --> 47:31.265
You live in your life
of blissful ignorance,

47:31.265 --> 47:33.862
and I'm being driven insane.

47:33.862 --> 47:37.445
And then one day, the voice talks to me,

47:37.445 --> 47:39.386
and he tells me all I
have to do to go home

47:39.386 --> 47:42.664
is kill every one of you heroes.

47:42.664 --> 47:44.202
You're the last one, Johnny.

47:44.202 --> 47:46.042
You're my ticket home.

47:46.042 --> 47:48.703
- Will Johnny
escape this dungeon of doom?

47:48.703 --> 47:50.063
Stay tuned, kids.

47:50.063 --> 47:52.407
We will find out after this
brief message from our sponsor.

47:52.407 --> 47:53.240
- Not now!

47:54.407 --> 47:57.155
- Hello, and thanks for joining
us, the September Brothers,

47:57.155 --> 48:00.085
for a quick public service announcement,

48:00.085 --> 48:02.225
and we'll get you back momentarily

48:02.225 --> 48:04.246
to the Johnny Justice Power Hour.

48:04.246 --> 48:07.505
- You may have recognized us
from the award-winning short,

48:07.505 --> 48:09.021
The Shamlin Shack.
- Shamlin Shack.

48:09.021 --> 48:12.805
- One of the best-reviewed zombie shorts

48:12.805 --> 48:14.805
ever put to film.
- Ever.

48:15.645 --> 48:17.480
Amazing it was.

48:17.480 --> 48:20.953
And that brings us to what
we're hoping to reach to.

48:20.953 --> 48:24.637
There's a group of people in this world

48:24.637 --> 48:28.203
that need your help,
they need your support.

48:28.203 --> 48:31.000
They're independent filmmakers.

48:31.000 --> 48:35.299
You see, big Hollywood
budgets are everywhere,

48:35.299 --> 48:38.941
and none of them were given
to these amazing talents

48:38.941 --> 48:43.108
that can bring you such awesome
films as The First Date,

48:45.444 --> 48:48.390
patent pending, first date
based on a true story.

48:48.390 --> 48:49.390
But, I mean,

48:50.949 --> 48:53.953
they're living there with microbudgets,

48:53.953 --> 48:56.134
I mean, a couple dollars and that's it.

48:56.134 --> 48:58.092
They've tried to bring you entertainment.

48:58.092 --> 49:00.534
- Microbudgets.

49:00.534 --> 49:02.812
- But you can help.

49:02.812 --> 49:06.354
You can support your local
independent filmmakers,

49:06.354 --> 49:10.021
and it can bring such
amazing things to you.

49:11.887 --> 49:13.191
- Amazing.

49:13.191 --> 49:17.358
- I just don't even know
how else to tell you guys

49:18.775 --> 49:20.836
what you can do for this community.

49:20.836 --> 49:23.665
- It could be handing
them cash right there,

49:23.665 --> 49:26.297
firm handshake and a pat on the ass--

49:26.297 --> 49:27.473
- And then more money.
- Accept that.

49:27.473 --> 49:30.972
- Support these local filmmakers.

49:30.972 --> 49:32.614
Do your part, do your part.

49:32.614 --> 49:35.334
It's important to bring the arts

49:35.334 --> 49:37.430
and entertainment home

49:37.430 --> 49:39.998
and only you can do it.

49:39.998 --> 49:41.915
For just pennies a day,

49:44.050 --> 49:46.252
a lot of pennies a day,

49:46.252 --> 49:49.790
like thousands and
thousands of pennies a day.

49:49.790 --> 49:53.532
You know, a couple of thousand
dollars a day, if you would,

49:53.532 --> 49:56.165
just you too can support it.

49:56.165 --> 49:57.752
And we'll,

49:57.752 --> 49:59.248
when you do this when
you make this donation,

49:59.248 --> 50:00.909
when you make this pledge,

50:00.909 --> 50:03.992
you can get sent, you know, a picture

50:05.213 --> 50:07.713
of the director that you're supporting,

50:07.713 --> 50:10.521
you know, a letter, a lovely
handwritten letter from him.

50:10.521 --> 50:11.938
Probably gonna be a lot
of swearing in there

50:11.938 --> 50:14.355
because we cuss like sailors.

50:15.375 --> 50:17.000
We're a hardy bunch.

50:17.000 --> 50:19.640
- Like if the only thing
the letter says to us

50:19.640 --> 50:21.957
says send nudes, sending nudes.

50:21.957 --> 50:23.261
- That might be what it says.

50:23.261 --> 50:26.388
- I'm about sending nudes.
- Sending the nudes.

50:26.388 --> 50:29.388
Alright, I guess, back to your show.

50:31.980 --> 50:34.376
- You don't even notice that, do you?

50:34.376 --> 50:37.600
My life freezes for two minutes at a time

50:37.600 --> 50:39.300
for these fucking commercials, and you,

50:39.300 --> 50:40.778
you don't even notice.

50:40.778 --> 50:43.882
They were a pain in my world
having to sit through them,

50:43.882 --> 50:45.402
but here, it's worse.

50:45.402 --> 50:47.815
You don't understand the pain,

50:47.815 --> 50:49.500
that's why I have to do this.

50:49.500 --> 50:53.242
That's why I have no
choice but to kill you.

50:53.242 --> 50:55.778
- Commercials, voices? What are you crazy?

50:55.778 --> 50:57.418
We have medications here for that.

50:57.418 --> 50:58.998
I don't, I don't understand.

50:58.998 --> 51:00.438
I don't hear any of that.

51:00.438 --> 51:02.373
You don't have to do any of this.

51:02.373 --> 51:04.361
- I do. I do have to do this.

51:04.361 --> 51:06.337
It's the only way.

51:06.337 --> 51:08.054
- I'm
not even a hero anymore.

51:08.054 --> 51:10.268
I retired a long time ago after I defeated

51:10.268 --> 51:12.605
my arch nemesis, The Masturbator.

51:16.589 --> 51:18.205
- No flashbacks!

51:18.205 --> 51:20.845
I don't have the time.

51:20.845 --> 51:22.246
This has to end now.

51:22.246 --> 51:25.163
I'm so tired of hearing the voices.

51:26.851 --> 51:28.408
I'm sick of being the only person

51:28.408 --> 51:32.491
in this miserable planet
that sees past the veil.

51:35.528 --> 51:37.163
- That's all
the time we have this week,

51:37.163 --> 51:38.285
boys and girls.

51:38.285 --> 51:41.121
Tune in next week to see our--
- No!

51:41.121 --> 51:42.064
This ends now!

51:52.907 --> 51:53.740
Finally.

51:54.967 --> 51:56.528
Finally done.

51:56.528 --> 51:59.361
No more narrators, no more voices.

52:01.944 --> 52:04.165
Where is the door?

52:04.165 --> 52:05.832
Where's my way home?

52:06.916 --> 52:09.666
I don't get it. I did everything.

52:10.607 --> 52:13.264
Everything that I was supposed to.

52:13.264 --> 52:16.181
I killed all those people for this,

52:19.224 --> 52:20.557
for my way home.

52:23.937 --> 52:26.270
What if, what if I am crazy?

52:27.858 --> 52:30.191
What if it's all in my head?

52:31.319 --> 52:33.341
Is that it? Am I crazy?

52:33.341 --> 52:35.181
Am I just a killer?

52:35.181 --> 52:37.536
Am I just a monster?

52:37.536 --> 52:42.177
I'm not crazy, what if,
what if I'm just a killer?!

52:42.177 --> 52:44.358
- Wait, wait.

52:44.358 --> 52:45.719
Your work isn't done.

52:45.719 --> 52:48.300
- Yes, it is. He was the last.

52:48.300 --> 52:50.361
- I brought
you into this world.

52:50.361 --> 52:52.638
I saw the potential for violence in you

52:52.638 --> 52:56.478
and needed your help to
end this scourge of heroes.

52:56.478 --> 52:59.580
Yes, he is the last one for now.

52:59.580 --> 53:01.241
But there will be more.

53:01.241 --> 53:03.796
Someone will take their place.

53:03.796 --> 53:07.380
Then you can teach them
the lesson as well.

53:07.380 --> 53:10.003
In the meantime, you can rule this world.

53:10.003 --> 53:13.321
You could be their god, and I your boss.

53:13.321 --> 53:14.814
- No.

53:14.814 --> 53:17.763
I'm done with this. I'm not your pawn.

53:17.763 --> 53:19.660
- Yes, you are.

53:19.660 --> 53:24.121
Make no mistake, you have been
my pawn for a long time now.

53:24.121 --> 53:27.843
All you have to do is sit
back and enjoy the spoils.

53:27.843 --> 53:30.337
- No, this, this ends now.

53:30.337 --> 53:31.829
- It ends when I release you

53:31.829 --> 53:34.070
from your miserable...

53:34.070 --> 53:34.987
Well, fuck.

53:37.409 --> 53:40.390
- So I'm guessing that was the
final episode of that show?

53:40.390 --> 53:42.505
- Actually, no, this
was an unaired episode.

53:42.505 --> 53:44.212
- Oh.
- I've been lucky enough to

53:44.212 --> 53:46.575
obtain a few rare
editions in my collection.

53:46.575 --> 53:47.671
- Is that so?

53:47.671 --> 53:51.838
- Yeah, as a matter of fact,
this next one is a classic.

59:55.070 --> 59:58.070
- Okay, but when I think of classic,

59:59.230 --> 01:00:03.368
I think of a bunch of people
stuck in a creepy house.

01:00:03.368 --> 01:00:04.201
- Okay.

01:00:05.848 --> 01:00:10.015
I think I have something that'll
play to your classic loves.

01:00:18.131 --> 01:00:20.714
- Denizen Nefarious.

01:00:26.367 --> 01:00:28.467
- Delta
Team has been contracted

01:00:28.467 --> 01:00:31.107
out to head to the middle
of nowhere to steal

01:00:31.107 --> 01:00:33.150
some weird object.

01:00:33.150 --> 01:00:36.008
Normally we would not take
such a weird contract,

01:00:36.008 --> 01:00:40.175
but under the circumstances,
the client was very persuasive.

01:00:43.267 --> 01:00:47.171
Whatever the object, it was
very important to our client,

01:00:47.171 --> 01:00:49.588
but that didn't matter to me.

01:00:51.765 --> 01:00:55.932
All I cared about was the number
of zeroes on the contract.

01:00:58.131 --> 01:01:01.091
I set off a couple of
hours to case the place

01:01:01.091 --> 01:01:04.841
before my partner shows
up to finish the job.

01:01:07.827 --> 01:01:10.747
The only information I
was given was the owner

01:01:10.747 --> 01:01:14.200
of the house was a weird loner inventor

01:01:14.200 --> 01:01:17.700
who, luckily, has not been seen for weeks.

01:01:21.379 --> 01:01:23.962
Some people even think he died.

01:01:26.723 --> 01:01:28.483
How easy that that?

01:01:28.483 --> 01:01:31.215
Steal from a dead guy's barn.

01:01:31.215 --> 01:01:33.048
Oh, how wrong we were.

01:01:40.521 --> 01:01:42.680
- My
name is Jim Bluefield.

01:01:42.680 --> 01:01:45.422
I am heading to meet my
partner, Kim Christmas,

01:01:45.422 --> 01:01:48.058
in a middle of nowhere
town to steal some objects

01:01:48.058 --> 01:01:49.141
of some sort.

01:01:49.982 --> 01:01:52.600
I am leaving early because
normally my partner

01:01:52.600 --> 01:01:54.419
would be sending me updates,

01:01:54.419 --> 01:01:58.739
but I haven't heard from
her in a long while.

01:01:58.739 --> 01:02:01.156
I will go in and lend a hand.

01:12:06.132 --> 01:12:09.169
- That felt really familiar.

01:12:09.169 --> 01:12:11.573
You know, I had a great time tonight.

01:12:11.573 --> 01:12:13.530
I never thought I'd have such a good time

01:12:13.530 --> 01:12:15.114
on a first date

01:12:15.114 --> 01:12:17.893
coming from a dating website.

01:12:17.893 --> 01:12:18.726
Thank you.

01:12:19.573 --> 01:12:21.034
I really should get going though.

01:12:21.034 --> 01:12:23.370
It's getting late, so--

01:12:23.370 --> 01:12:27.113
- Okay, but I have one more
film I want you to watch.

01:12:27.113 --> 01:12:27.946
- Okay.

01:13:56.627 --> 01:13:59.460
What the hell? What am I watching?

01:14:01.011 --> 01:14:02.968
What the fuck is going on?

01:14:02.968 --> 01:14:06.218
Is this some kind of sick fucking joke?

01:14:11.632 --> 01:14:13.470
What is going on?

01:14:13.470 --> 01:14:15.387
Why do I feel this way?

01:14:17.027 --> 01:14:18.248
- Looks like what I put in the popcorn

01:14:18.248 --> 01:14:20.527
is finally kicking in.

01:14:20.527 --> 01:14:22.590
You know, they always tell girls that they

01:14:22.590 --> 01:14:24.121
should poor their own drinks,

01:14:24.121 --> 01:14:27.031
but they never tell them
about things like popcorn.

01:14:27.031 --> 01:14:30.028
Well, I guess now you know.

01:14:30.028 --> 01:14:32.586
You see, I'm a collector of sorts.

01:14:32.586 --> 01:14:34.252
Every film that you watched,

01:14:34.252 --> 01:14:36.668
that's a soul that's in my collection.

01:14:36.668 --> 01:14:39.428
Each one of them was
obsessed with something.

01:14:39.428 --> 01:14:41.351
I mean, maybe it was a record, or science,

01:14:41.351 --> 01:14:44.070
or going home, or some little trinket.

01:14:44.070 --> 01:14:46.588
Their obsession called to me.

01:14:46.588 --> 01:14:47.755
I can hear it.

01:14:48.951 --> 01:14:51.148
And that call from their soul,

01:14:51.148 --> 01:14:53.731
well that becomes my obsession.

01:14:54.951 --> 01:14:57.511
- What does that have to do with me?

01:14:57.511 --> 01:14:59.772
- Because you're obsessed too.

01:14:59.772 --> 01:15:03.308
You're obsessed with
finding the perfect person.

01:15:03.308 --> 01:15:04.947
You go out to all these clubs,

01:15:04.947 --> 01:15:06.591
you go on dating sites,

01:15:06.591 --> 01:15:08.845
you ask all of your friends to set you up

01:15:08.845 --> 01:15:11.970
just to find the perfect person.

01:15:11.970 --> 01:15:13.348
Oh, I can hear it.

01:15:13.348 --> 01:15:15.725
Even now, you're
obsession cries out to me.

01:15:15.725 --> 01:15:19.730
It drowns out everything
else in the world.

01:15:19.730 --> 01:15:20.897
But no longer.

01:15:23.176 --> 01:15:27.050
Because I am the perfect man for you.

01:15:27.050 --> 01:15:27.967
I love you,

01:15:28.948 --> 01:15:32.212
even for all your imperfections.

01:15:32.212 --> 01:15:35.332
And I never plan to let you go.

01:15:35.332 --> 01:15:37.749
Now, just one good night kiss

01:15:39.175 --> 01:15:42.758
and I'll send you off
to join my menagerie.

01:16:22.046 --> 01:16:23.963
