01:28.740 --> 01:31.526

AND THAT'S A FACT.IT'S NOT--
IT'S NOT GLAMOROUS.

[Massive Attack's "Teardrop"

02:19.661 --> 02:21.141
I'M NOT SAYING "HOUSE M.D."

02:23.665 --> 02:24.622
WAIT A MINUTE,

02:24.666 --> 02:26.189
ACTUALLY I AM SAYING THAT.

02:26.233 --> 02:29.584
BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY,
IF "HOUSE" IS THE KING,

02:29.627 --> 02:31.063
THEN THE PEOPLE
WHO MAKE "HOUSE"

IT SIGNIFY?UH, WHITE BUCKET

04:54.337 --> 04:55.991

05:16.403 --> 05:18.361

SORT OF REVOLVED AROUND

05:18.405 --> 05:20.363

WITH THIS CHARACTER,

THAT WE HAD TO REALLY GET
THAT CHARACTER PERFECTLY,

HE HAD THE RIGHT KIND OF VOICE.

05:49.305 --> 05:51.089
AND HE HAD
A GOOD RAZOR STUBBLE GOING.

05:51.133 --> 05:53.309
AND I THOUGHT, THIS--
THIS GUY FEELS LIKE HOUSE.

05:53.353 --> 05:55.790

HE'S AN AMERICAN,

05:55.833 --> 05:57.400
