00:08.000 --> 00:09.417
You know,
when you said that you wanted

00:09.500 --> 00:10.917
to hit the courts,
I thought you meant

00:11.000 --> 00:12.917
the basketball court,
not the food court.

00:13.000 --> 00:14.333
Basketball?

00:14.417 --> 00:16.417
What kind of father-son bonding
would that be?

00:16.500 --> 00:18.709
Wait. Then why are you
wearing workout clothes?

00:18.792 --> 00:20.709
'Cause it absorbs
the meat sweats.

00:20.792 --> 00:23.041
And we are gonna sweat,
believe you me.

00:25.542 --> 00:27.917
Oh. Sh... Mm.

00:28.000 --> 00:29.458
(line ringing)

00:29.542 --> 00:31.542
All right,

00:29.542 --> 00:31.542
give me a second here.

00:31.625 --> 00:33.834
Hey, sweetie, make it quick.

00:31.625 --> 00:33.834
I'm headed into a tunnel.

00:33.917 --> 00:35.250
<i>Listen, I need you</i>

00:33.917 --> 00:35.250
<i>to pick something</i>

00:35.333 --> 00:36.792
up for me while you're

00:35.333 --> 00:36.792
still at the mall.

00:36.875 --> 00:38.333
Sure, babe. Whatever you need.

00:38.417 --> 00:40.792
It's a bra,

00:38.417 --> 00:40.792
and it's from The Pink Drawer.

00:40.875 --> 00:42.041
No way. You're on your own.

00:42.125 --> 00:43.875
Tim, come on!

00:43.959 --> 00:45.750
I ruined Sam's favorite bra

00:43.959 --> 00:45.750
in the wash,

00:45.834 --> 00:48.083
and I need to replace it

00:45.834 --> 00:48.083
before she finds out.

00:48.166 --> 00:49.333
<i>Look, you want me</i>

00:49.417 --> 00:50.875
to pick out a bra? Me?

00:50.959 --> 00:53.208
I'm the guy who can't even say

00:50.959 --> 00:53.208
"angina" without giggling.

00:53.291 --> 00:55.166
<i>(giggles)</i>

00:55.250 --> 00:57.959
See that? And I'm a doctor,

00:55.250 --> 00:57.959
Heather, and I have angina!

00:58.041 --> 00:59.458
(giggles)

00:59.542 --> 01:02.417
Tim, come on, okay?

00:59.542 --> 01:02.417
She is gonna yell at me.

01:02.500 --> 01:03.875
I am so afraid of her.

01:03.959 --> 01:06.083
Fine. Just text me the details.

01:06.166 --> 01:08.625
You know

01:06.166 --> 01:08.625
I'll do anything for you.

01:08.709 --> 01:11.291
Your mom needs you to pick out

01:08.709 --> 01:11.291
a bra for your sister.

01:11.375 --> 01:12.667
What?

01:12.750 --> 01:15.959
One Super Funnel

01:12.750 --> 01:15.959
and one Chunnel Funnel, please.

01:16.041 --> 01:17.333
You want anything?

01:17.417 --> 01:19.959
Can I just get some fruit?

01:20.959 --> 01:22.417
Never have kids.

01:22.500 --> 01:25.125
Makes you have to do a bunch

01:22.500 --> 01:25.125
of stuff you don't want to do.

01:25.208 --> 01:26.417
This isn't a big deal.

01:26.500 --> 01:27.917
Maybe you could stand

01:26.500 --> 01:27.917
to actually

01:28.000 --> 01:29.291
engage with

01:28.000 --> 01:29.291
the female experience

01:29.375 --> 01:31.083
instead of letting it

01:29.375 --> 01:31.083
be a mystery to you.

01:31.166 --> 01:34.291
(laughs) You watch a baby

01:31.166 --> 01:34.291
explode out of your wife,

01:34.375 --> 01:37.083
and then tell me the female

01:34.375 --> 01:37.083
experience isn't a mystery.

01:37.166 --> 01:39.250
Look, it's fine.

01:37.166 --> 01:39.250
I'll take care of it.

01:39.333 --> 01:41.333
Uh-huh.

01:45.917 --> 01:47.709
-What happened?

01:45.917 --> 01:47.709
-It's all women in there.

01:47.792 --> 01:49.458
No doy! It's a bra shop.

01:49.542 --> 01:52.458
Yes, but I cannot invade

01:49.542 --> 01:52.458
their personal female space

01:52.542 --> 01:53.959
with my maleness.

01:54.041 --> 01:55.625
Women get so few

01:54.041 --> 01:55.625
public safe spaces.

01:55.709 --> 01:58.959
All right, look, hey,

01:55.709 --> 01:58.959
huddle up, huddle up.

01:59.041 --> 02:00.625
You cannot huddle

01:59.041 --> 02:00.625
with two people.

02:00.709 --> 02:01.917
This is just hugging.

02:02.000 --> 02:04.208
Listen, we set out today

02:04.291 --> 02:06.125
to spend some quality time

02:04.291 --> 02:06.125
together.

02:06.208 --> 02:08.208
Now let's get in there

02:06.208 --> 02:08.208
and do it.

02:10.667 --> 02:13.291
Hi. Can I help you
with something?

02:13.375 --> 02:14.959
You're right.
I shouldn't be here.

02:15.041 --> 02:16.166
Are you lost?

02:16.250 --> 02:18.166
My dad needs to buy a bra.

02:18.250 --> 02:22.041
I'll be over there honoring
the space, but not invading it.

02:22.125 --> 02:24.834
Uh...

02:24.917 --> 02:27.166
Anyway, I need a bra.

02:27.250 --> 02:29.792
Okay, well, you look like
you're about a 40A.

02:29.875 --> 02:31.500
-Measure you...
-Oh, no, no, no, it's not

02:29.875 --> 02:31.500
for me.

02:31.583 --> 02:34.125
-Oh.
-(giggles) No. Thank you

02:31.583 --> 02:34.125
for the "A," though.

02:34.208 --> 02:36.792
Um, I need a Chloe bra,

02:36.875 --> 02:39.959
uh, in nude, size 32B.

02:40.041 --> 02:43.375
Okay, well, this is
the Chloe line right here.

02:43.458 --> 02:45.166
Oh. Wow.

02:45.250 --> 02:48.166
You want a racerback,
a front clasp or T-shirt?

02:48.250 --> 02:50.959
I know I need nude.

02:51.041 --> 02:52.500
Demi? Full coverage?

02:52.583 --> 02:54.166
I just need to get nude.

02:54.250 --> 02:56.083
I mean, just go get nude.

02:56.166 --> 02:59.291
I mean, just... I need a bra.

02:59.375 --> 03:00.542
Okay.

03:02.959 --> 03:04.959
(quietly):
Yes. Dudes.

03:07.417 --> 03:10.667
It's so hard to be an affront
to femininity, am I right, guys?

03:10.750 --> 03:12.625
Dude, don't make this weird.

03:12.709 --> 03:14.875
Just read ESPN.

03:16.875 --> 03:18.875
Don't look up.

03:20.542 --> 03:21.875
(scoffs)
There's too many options here.

03:21.959 --> 03:23.458
I'm in way over my head!

03:23.542 --> 03:25.792
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
Babe, don't panic.

03:25.875 --> 03:28.542
Listen, if you can find
a peach-pear in the middle

03:28.625 --> 03:31.500
of a bowl of Jelly Bellys,
you can find me this bra.

03:31.583 --> 03:33.208
<i>Why don't you just</i>
<i>take a picture of it</i>

03:33.291 --> 03:35.709
and then you send it to me, and
I'll let you know if it's right.

03:35.792 --> 03:38.291
There... we go.

03:38.375 --> 03:40.291
(camera clicking)

03:40.375 --> 03:41.750
So, I've got a few options...

03:41.834 --> 03:43.750
Yeah, that's it right there.
That's nice.

03:43.834 --> 03:45.709
-(camera clicks)
-Yeah.

03:45.792 --> 03:46.959
(chuckles)

03:47.041 --> 03:49.709
Oh. No, my wife told me
to do this.

03:49.792 --> 03:52.583
Of course. So I got
a few options that, uh,

03:52.667 --> 03:54.583
"your wife" might
be interested in.

03:54.667 --> 03:56.792
See, I feel like you
said that with air quotes,

03:56.875 --> 03:58.667
and that's kind of hurtful.

04:01.959 --> 04:03.375
Mom?

04:04.375 --> 04:05.625
(gasps loudly)

04:05.709 --> 04:07.667
Mom, there was
a boy right there,

04:07.750 --> 04:09.166
and now he knows I have boobs!

04:09.250 --> 04:10.875
Well, there's nothing wrong
with that.

04:10.959 --> 04:13.083
I mean, there...
Maybe there is. I don't know.

04:13.166 --> 04:14.834
Well, whichever's
less offensive.

04:14.917 --> 04:16.917
Told you not to look up.

04:18.458 --> 04:20.875
Okay, this one is unlined.
Did you need lined?

04:20.959 --> 04:23.333
I just know I need nude.
What's the difference?

04:23.417 --> 04:24.500
Well, it depends if you need

04:24.583 --> 04:25.709
extra thickness
for nipple protrusion.

04:25.792 --> 04:29.166
Uh... does your sister
have nipple protrusion?

04:29.250 --> 04:31.125
Are you seriously
asking me that?

04:31.208 --> 04:32.458
Her mother does.

04:32.542 --> 04:34.625
Does that run in families?

04:34.709 --> 04:36.542
-I don't think
I can ever unhear that.

04:34.709 --> 04:36.542
-You know what?

04:36.625 --> 04:38.625
-I'll take 'em all.
I'm done. Let's move on.

04:36.625 --> 04:38.625
-Okay.

04:38.709 --> 04:40.083
-Everything I've shown you?
-Yes!

04:40.166 --> 04:42.834
All the bras, every single bra.
Here's my card.

04:42.917 --> 04:44.834
-This is great.
-Pick something out

04:42.917 --> 04:44.834
for yourself.

04:44.917 --> 04:46.542
-Thank you.
-I don't care. Just put it

04:44.917 --> 04:46.542
in a Foot Locker bag

04:46.625 --> 04:47.667
and get us out of here.

04:51.375 --> 04:54.333
Oh. This bra comes
with a free pair of panties.

04:54.417 --> 04:56.500
We're kind of in a rush
to get out of here, so...

04:56.583 --> 04:58.959
It's a free pair of panties.
Why don't you want it?

04:59.041 --> 05:01.834
(chuckles) All right,
go pick out a pair of panties.

05:01.917 --> 05:03.208
Do I have to?

05:03.291 --> 05:06.291
Son, I said go pick out
a pair of panties!

05:07.291 --> 05:09.333
(giggles)

05:11.208 --> 05:14.000
Hey. Huddle up.

05:15.458 --> 05:17.291
If looking like a pervert
is what it takes

05:17.375 --> 05:20.208
to get some quality bonding time
with my son, then you count me

05:20.291 --> 05:22.333
as the most depraved pervert
in this whole damn town.

05:22.417 --> 05:23.750
(sighs) Thanks, Dad.

05:23.834 --> 05:25.250
Maybe next weekend, you can come

05:25.333 --> 05:26.917
to that art gallery
opening with me.

05:27.000 --> 05:29.208
Nah.

05:29.291 --> 05:31.291
Okay.

05:33.834 --> 05:36.291
-Did you get my e-mail?
-Mm-hmm.

05:36.375 --> 05:39.500
I'm hoping to revive the
tradition of a family cookbook,

05:39.583 --> 05:42.250
and I was gonna ask you
for a recipe.

05:42.333 --> 05:44.291
I know you don't cook,

05:44.375 --> 05:47.208
but it could be anything,
anything at all, something easy.

05:47.291 --> 05:51.291
Like, I've heard your scrambled
eggs are diner quality.

05:51.375 --> 05:53.875
Yeah, they sure are.
So is my career in law.

05:53.959 --> 05:57.166
Everything about me,
really, is diner quality.

05:57.250 --> 06:01.041
Wonderful. And don't forget
the story behind the recipe.

06:01.125 --> 06:04.375
You know, like how you can
cook scrambled eggs.

06:04.458 --> 06:06.375
She always twists that knife
right at the end.

06:06.458 --> 06:07.667
Mm-hmm.

06:09.250 --> 06:11.000
I mean,
who has a family cookbook?

06:11.083 --> 06:12.834
You know how
my family shows love?

06:12.917 --> 06:15.667
By fighting over who pays the
check at Chinese restaurants.

06:15.750 --> 06:17.750
Well, so then don't put
in a recipe.

06:17.834 --> 06:19.667
I mean, you don't have
anything to prove.

06:19.750 --> 06:22.000
Yeah, but then there won't
be any recipe from us.

06:22.083 --> 06:24.500
I mean, what's Lark gonna
think? That her mom can't cook?

06:24.583 --> 06:27.291
I want her to learn that
from the garbage I serve her,

06:27.375 --> 06:28.750
not from some book.

06:28.834 --> 06:31.083
Okay, well,
then let's just try and look

06:31.166 --> 06:33.375
for a recipe for something
that we love, you know?

06:33.458 --> 06:36.792
Oh, like the, uh, the
She-Crab soup from Maribella's.

06:36.875 --> 06:38.417
Yeah, but isn't that,
like, cheating?

06:38.500 --> 06:41.000
Well, I mean, it's fudging
the truth a little bit.

06:41.083 --> 06:42.709
Like that 10K we said we ran.

06:42.792 --> 06:45.125
We bought the shirts
to prove that we were there.

06:45.208 --> 06:47.458
That soup is what we had
on our first date.

06:47.542 --> 06:48.959
-Yeah.
-Right?

06:49.041 --> 06:51.208
So, when Lark reads
this recipe in the book,

06:51.291 --> 06:54.208
she'll know that it represents
something special to us.

06:54.291 --> 06:55.667
That we were willing to lie

06:55.750 --> 06:57.583
to make her feel
a part of something.

06:57.667 --> 07:01.000
-Yeah.
-I'm into it.

07:01.083 --> 07:05.166
Okay. Only problem is, we can't
take my parents to Maribella's.

07:05.250 --> 07:07.625
Mm-hmm. I'm into it.

07:10.792 --> 07:12.375
GREG:
Okay, we're here.

07:12.458 --> 07:13.917
-What's the big surprise?
-Oh, you're here!

07:14.000 --> 07:16.375
-I've got a big surprise!
-JEN: Yeah.

07:16.458 --> 07:18.458
I feel like we've established
there's a surprise.

07:18.542 --> 07:21.750
Oh. Well, Jen,
I-I was so touched

07:21.834 --> 07:24.375
by the recipe that you sent

07:24.458 --> 07:26.417
-and the story behind it.
-Oh.

07:26.500 --> 07:28.542
You know,
your "booba" Luba Svanya.

07:28.625 --> 07:29.583
<i>Bubbe.</i>

07:29.667 --> 07:30.667
<i>-Bubbe.</i>
-Yeah. Mm-hmm.

07:30.750 --> 07:32.750
<i>-Bubbe </i>Luba Svanya.

07:32.834 --> 07:33.917
-Yeah, that's it.
-You know,

07:34.000 --> 07:35.000
hiding from the Russians

07:35.083 --> 07:36.709
-and the boxes of crabs.
-Right.

07:36.792 --> 07:39.875
Boy, she had to have thick skin
in more ways than one.

07:39.959 --> 07:42.250
Anyway, I was so eager

07:42.333 --> 07:46.250
to taste the soup
that I got a case of crabs.

07:46.333 --> 07:48.500
What?

07:48.583 --> 07:51.208
From a fisherman. In Maryland.

07:51.291 --> 07:52.458
What are you talking about?

07:52.542 --> 07:54.083
(grunts)

07:56.041 --> 07:58.041
I've got crabs!

08:01.000 --> 08:03.417
I'm so excited to learn
from you.

08:03.500 --> 08:05.834
How do you make your roux?

08:05.917 --> 08:07.417
Hmm.

08:07.500 --> 08:11.083
Well, uh, obviously, Mom,
it-it starts with a pot.

08:11.166 --> 08:13.792
And it starts with a crab.

08:13.875 --> 08:15.250
Ah.

08:15.333 --> 08:16.375
(quietly):
No?

08:16.458 --> 08:18.375
Uh, well, no.
A traditional roux,

08:18.458 --> 08:20.375
you thicken the flour

08:20.458 --> 08:23.625
with some butter and milk
on a low flame.

08:23.709 --> 08:24.667
-Sure.
-Right? I mean,

08:24.750 --> 08:25.917
I don't know how your...

08:26.000 --> 08:27.208
your <i>bubbe </i>did it, but...

08:27.291 --> 08:28.667
Yeah, and a-actually, you know,

08:28.750 --> 08:30.834
it was my great-great <i>bubbe.</i>

08:30.917 --> 08:34.583
My-my... "grubbe."

08:34.667 --> 08:38.333
And your great-great grubbe,
she wasn't concerned that...

08:38.417 --> 08:41.083
that the crab wasn't kosher?

08:43.125 --> 08:45.875
The rabbi gave her a waiver.

08:45.959 --> 08:49.000
-Ah. Right. Right.
-Mm-hmm.

08:50.291 --> 08:52.792
Add one clove of garlic.

08:52.875 --> 08:55.333
One clove.

08:55.417 --> 08:58.959
Or one entire head of garlic
with the skin still on.

08:59.041 --> 09:00.500
Oh, it's so rustic.

09:00.583 --> 09:01.583
Ah.

09:01.667 --> 09:03.542
Next is dry sherry.

09:04.542 --> 09:07.208
Ooh!
I have some in the bathroom.

09:09.667 --> 09:12.959
How do I dry sherry?
It's liquid.

09:13.041 --> 09:15.166
It's an adjective, honey.

09:15.250 --> 09:18.208
Sherry is dry.
Like Arizona or your wit.

09:18.291 --> 09:19.583
-Oh.
-Yeah, okay?

09:19.667 --> 09:21.041
You're smart.

09:21.125 --> 09:22.625
-You're an attorney.
You got this.

09:21.125 --> 09:22.625
-Yeah. Yeah.

09:22.709 --> 09:23.834
We got this.

09:23.917 --> 09:25.166
Yeah.

09:25.250 --> 09:26.208
Got it.

09:26.291 --> 09:28.250
Great. Oh.

09:28.333 --> 09:31.041
(chuckles)

09:33.750 --> 09:34.875
Wow.

09:36.875 --> 09:39.333
Oh, wow. The seeds and all.

09:41.375 --> 09:43.250
There's a tag on that one,
honey.

09:44.125 --> 09:45.583
It is rustic.

09:47.291 --> 09:48.625
Great.

09:48.709 --> 09:50.709
Voilà.

09:52.166 --> 09:54.041
Okay.

09:54.125 --> 09:55.542
(chuckles softly)

10:00.625 --> 10:03.625
Oh, my God, it's delicious!

10:03.709 --> 10:04.917
Mmm.

10:05.041 --> 10:06.458
It is!

10:06.542 --> 10:08.208
This is, like,
the best thing I've ever made,

10:08.291 --> 10:09.583
other than Lark.

10:09.667 --> 10:11.083
This is probably better.

10:11.166 --> 10:13.041
You guys, I cooked.

10:13.125 --> 10:14.417
And it's good!

10:14.500 --> 10:16.959
From her Russian soul to yours.

10:17.041 --> 10:18.000
Oh.

10:18.083 --> 10:19.625
(chuckles)

10:21.291 --> 10:23.542
Dodged that bullet.
(clears throat)

10:29.208 --> 10:31.250
Okay, you just have
to stay with them

10:31.333 --> 10:33.375
until Tyler and
Clementine get back.

10:33.458 --> 10:35.000
You want <i>me </i>to babysit?

10:35.083 --> 10:37.333
I thought the whole point
of having three kids

10:37.417 --> 10:39.166
was to make your own babysitter.

10:39.250 --> 10:42.375
Yeah, well, normally Sam would
do it, but she's grounded

10:42.458 --> 10:44.208
because she came home late
from a boy's party.

10:44.291 --> 10:46.291
I told you, I wasn't late.

10:46.375 --> 10:48.834
I was on time because I don't
follow daylight savings.

10:48.917 --> 10:50.542
I ain't no farmer.

10:50.625 --> 10:52.208
All right, girls,
grab your coats

10:52.291 --> 10:54.250
and anything else
you feel lucky with.

10:54.333 --> 10:56.250
-We're going to the track.
-Oh, whoa.

10:56.333 --> 10:58.917
Hey, no, no, no, no. You
can't take them to the track.

10:59.000 --> 11:00.458
No, this one is grounded,

11:00.542 --> 11:03.000
and Sophia is showing
addictive tendencies.

11:03.083 --> 11:06.291
Says the woman with a purse
full of scratchers.

11:08.834 --> 11:11.667
Everyone's at hashtag
"Madison's White Party" but me.

11:11.750 --> 11:13.709
This Madison's a racist?

11:13.792 --> 11:16.917
No, Pop-Pop. A white party just
means you have to wear white.

11:17.000 --> 11:19.750
Oh, yeah. I got tricked
into one of those once.

11:20.667 --> 11:22.667
Trust me, it was racist.

11:22.750 --> 11:25.208
Hang on a second.
I thought you hated Madison.

11:25.291 --> 11:27.959
Why would you even want
to go to her dumb party?

11:28.041 --> 11:30.125
Jenna and I were going
to wear red

11:30.208 --> 11:32.125
to show Madison we're not sheep.

11:32.208 --> 11:35.041
Jenna's weak. She'll wear white.

11:35.125 --> 11:36.792
That's my best friend.

11:36.875 --> 11:39.083
And she won't. She promised me.

11:39.166 --> 11:40.667
Anyone want to make

11:40.750 --> 11:43.500
this incredibly boring
conversation interesting?

11:46.875 --> 11:49.375
Your mom left this money
for food.

11:49.458 --> 11:53.125
Now, if Jenna wears white,
Sophia wins the pot.

11:53.208 --> 11:56.250
If Jenna wears red, Sam gets it.

11:56.333 --> 11:58.834
Deal.

12:00.250 --> 12:01.792
SOPHIA:
So, along with whether Jenna

12:01.875 --> 12:04.625
is gonna wear red or white,
here's what we have so far:

12:04.709 --> 12:07.333
jock spills a drink,
three to one;

12:07.417 --> 12:10.083
gym teacher shows
up at ten to one;

12:10.166 --> 12:11.750
and cops bust the party
at 30 to one.

12:11.834 --> 12:13.417
JOHN:
I'll take those odds.

12:13.500 --> 12:16.709
Hey, someone tweeted a
photo of two girls kissing.

12:16.792 --> 12:18.333
Anyone have that?

12:18.417 --> 12:20.667
Mm, those are two boys,
and I did.

12:20.750 --> 12:23.000
Five to one. Pay up.

12:23.083 --> 12:25.333
Boy, parties have changed.

12:25.417 --> 12:28.500
We used to just steal the mascot
from the other school

12:28.583 --> 12:30.792
and get it drunk.

12:30.875 --> 12:32.959
We talking person or animal?

12:35.959 --> 12:37.208
-(chuckles)
-(door closes)

12:37.291 --> 12:38.917
-Oh, no.
-Hey, Pop-Pop.

12:39.000 --> 12:40.917
-We're here to take over
the babysitting duties.

12:39.000 --> 12:40.917
-No, thanks.

12:41.000 --> 12:42.542
The action's pretty good
in here,

12:42.625 --> 12:44.375
and I'm on a hot streak.

12:44.458 --> 12:46.458
-Fat Rob ordered a pizza.
-(chuckles)

12:46.542 --> 12:48.792
Wait, are you guys gambling
on a high school party?

12:48.875 --> 12:50.000
You want in?

12:50.083 --> 12:51.667
I-I think I'm a little
above that, Sam.

12:51.750 --> 12:53.583
I'm not gonna stoop to...
Wait, are you going

12:53.667 --> 12:55.959
ten to one on someone
getting pushed into the pool?

12:56.041 --> 12:57.959
Oh, take that.
The hockey team is there.

12:58.041 --> 12:59.250
That's their only move.

12:59.333 --> 13:00.458
I'm in.

13:00.542 --> 13:01.500
Scoot.

13:01.583 --> 13:02.625
What are you betting?

13:02.709 --> 13:03.875
20.

13:03.959 --> 13:05.166
Changing 20!

13:05.250 --> 13:06.667
Thank you.

13:06.750 --> 13:08.959
Who's that girl
taking a selfie with Jenna?

13:11.041 --> 13:12.875
That-that's Madison.

13:12.959 --> 13:14.709
Why does she have
her arm around her?

13:14.792 --> 13:16.875
SOPHIA:
And Jenna's wearing white.

13:16.959 --> 13:18.291
So hand it over, Pops.

13:18.375 --> 13:20.375
Take it all.

13:20.458 --> 13:22.583
I don't care.

13:22.667 --> 13:24.250
Sam makes the night

13:24.333 --> 13:25.625
all about her.

13:25.709 --> 13:28.041
You owe me ten.

13:28.125 --> 13:30.500
(knock on door)

13:30.583 --> 13:32.625
Hey, Sam.

13:32.709 --> 13:34.333
You okay?

13:34.417 --> 13:36.375
All it took
was me missing one party

13:36.458 --> 13:38.333
for my best friend
to bail on me.

13:38.417 --> 13:39.709
Well, maybe things
will work out.

13:39.792 --> 13:41.208
Th-That's why we gamble.

13:41.291 --> 13:42.834
I thought you gamble

13:42.917 --> 13:45.125
because you came from
a long line of degenerates.

13:45.208 --> 13:47.583
No. We gamble
because we never know

13:47.667 --> 13:49.291
how things are gonna end.

13:49.375 --> 13:53.542
Apparently, hashtag
"Party's busted" is trending.

13:53.625 --> 13:56.709
The police are sending
everybody home right now.

13:56.792 --> 13:58.041
-Really?
-Mm-hmm.

13:58.125 --> 13:59.667
Someone called the cops?

13:59.750 --> 14:01.125
Yeah, I guess so.

14:01.208 --> 14:04.834
I shouldn't be glad, but I am.
(chuckles)

14:04.917 --> 14:07.750
Yeah, well, don't worry. I'm
not gonna let you lose a friend.

14:07.834 --> 14:11.583
Wait, did <i>you </i>call the cops?

14:11.667 --> 14:12.875
Hmm?

14:12.959 --> 14:14.166
(chuckles)

14:14.250 --> 14:15.875
Oh. Oh.

14:15.959 --> 14:19.333
Thank you, Pop-Pop.

14:19.417 --> 14:23.542
Hey. You had cops bust
the party at 30 to one.

14:23.625 --> 14:25.166
You know, the best
part of gambling

14:25.250 --> 14:27.000
is when you know
the race is fixed.

14:27.083 --> 14:29.375
-(chuckles)
-And you owe me 200 bucks.

14:29.458 --> 14:30.417
Okay.

14:30.500 --> 14:32.500
(chuckles):
Right.

14:32.583 --> 14:34.291
Oh, r-really?

14:40.458 --> 14:42.542
COLLEEN:
<i>It's so fun having you</i>

14:40.458 --> 14:42.542
<i>stay here.</i>

14:42.625 --> 14:44.125
Two half-sisters
living together?

14:44.208 --> 14:46.000
It's like one whole sister.

14:46.083 --> 14:47.583
-(both laugh)
-MATT: All righty.

14:47.667 --> 14:49.583
Oh, is there any more coffee?

14:49.667 --> 14:50.834
-Mm.
-Oh, there is,

14:50.917 --> 14:52.583
but that's the C-word.

14:52.667 --> 14:54.542
(chuckles)
Caffeine is a strict no-no

14:54.625 --> 14:56.125
for soon-to-be baby surrogates.

14:56.208 --> 14:58.625
We did make you
some hot water with lemon,

14:58.709 --> 15:00.583
which is really healthy
for you.

15:00.667 --> 15:02.417
Mm, this just tastes like water.

15:02.500 --> 15:04.041
Yeah, we didn't have any lemon.

15:04.125 --> 15:05.375
-Oh.
-And because you are

15:05.458 --> 15:07.291
a special lady
who is going to be carrying

15:07.375 --> 15:09.959
our one viable embryo,
we got you a little gift.

15:10.041 --> 15:11.125
Ah! (chuckles)

15:11.208 --> 15:13.917
-(chuckles)
-Prenatal pills! Yum!

15:11.208 --> 15:13.917
-Oh.

15:14.000 --> 15:16.041
Yum. Thank you.

15:16.125 --> 15:17.500
No, this is great.
So much better than

15:17.583 --> 15:20.333
a purse or jewelry
or anything you don't swallow.

15:20.417 --> 15:22.250
Can I get that, uh,
childproof lid for you?

15:22.333 --> 15:23.750
-Here we go.
-Guys.

15:23.834 --> 15:25.000
Guys, come on. (chuckles)

15:25.083 --> 15:26.583
I get what you're doing, okay?

15:26.667 --> 15:29.625
I know how important
this is to you.

15:29.709 --> 15:31.291
Okay.

15:35.792 --> 15:37.542
-She didn't take a pill.
-It's okay.

15:37.625 --> 15:40.291
-We can crush one up
in her cereal tomorrow.

15:37.625 --> 15:40.291
-Yeah.

15:40.375 --> 15:42.000
MATT:
<i>Thank you, guys,</i>

15:40.375 --> 15:42.000
<i>so much for having us.</i>

15:42.083 --> 15:44.458
And for the healthy meal.

15:44.542 --> 15:46.458
We've been trying
to force Rita to eat better,

15:46.542 --> 15:49.375
but no one's into lean protein
when you have the munchies.

15:49.458 --> 15:51.583
Yeah. Well, you know what,
listen, we're happy to do it.

15:51.667 --> 15:53.583
The greener the better, right?
For Rita and for us.

15:53.667 --> 15:55.417
Yeah, why do we have
to be punished?

15:55.500 --> 15:57.166
I mean, I don't even know
what utensil to use.

15:57.250 --> 15:59.709
Which fork is for throwing
stuff in the garbage?

15:59.792 --> 16:01.625
I think we should be eating
like this more,

16:01.709 --> 16:04.041
instead of sucking the soul
out of some poor animal.

16:04.125 --> 16:06.333
Oh, come on.
You ate salmon last night.

16:06.417 --> 16:08.417
-And it was deeply traumatic.
-(doorbell rings)

16:08.500 --> 16:09.792
Ooh, that's Rita.

16:09.875 --> 16:11.834
Come on in! Door's open!

16:11.917 --> 16:14.166
-Hi-ee!
-Hi-ee!

16:14.250 --> 16:16.250
I brought fried chicken!

16:16.333 --> 16:18.083
-Oh, great!
-No, no, no, no, no...

16:18.166 --> 16:20.333
You can put that right here.

16:20.417 --> 16:21.417
(mutters)

16:21.500 --> 16:23.250
-COLLEEN: Do something, Matt.
-MATT: Oh!

16:23.333 --> 16:27.333
Wow, Rita!
That's <i>really </i>fried.

16:27.417 --> 16:29.083
Yeah, they call it double-fried.
It's where they bread

16:29.166 --> 16:30.875
fried chicken
and then they fry it.

16:30.959 --> 16:32.458
Oh, I can't believe
you waited in that line.

16:32.542 --> 16:34.542
-Yeah.
-Did you get a side

16:32.542 --> 16:34.542
of the deep fried pizza?

16:34.625 --> 16:36.959
-Oh, did I. (chuckles)
-This stuff melts in your mouth

16:37.041 --> 16:39.250
'cause of a special chemical
they put in the dippin' sauce.

16:39.333 --> 16:41.542
It's less of a dipping sauce
and more of a salty pudding,

16:41.625 --> 16:43.542
-'cause it's so thick.
-Okay, thank you.

16:41.625 --> 16:43.542
You know what?

16:43.625 --> 16:45.333
Rita's not gonna have any
of this,

16:45.417 --> 16:47.458
because salty pudding
is off-limits.

16:47.542 --> 16:50.667
I mean, we're implanting
our embryo in two weeks,

16:50.750 --> 16:54.083
so whatever you eat now is gonna
be lining your uterine wall.

16:54.166 --> 16:55.625
No, trust me.

16:55.709 --> 16:58.333
You eat this stuff,
it does not stop to say hello.

16:58.417 --> 17:00.417
It just comes and goes.

17:00.500 --> 17:02.291
Speaking of which...

17:03.083 --> 17:05.083
Excuse me for a moment.

17:05.166 --> 17:07.417
Fine. I mean, am I even
allowed to sit here?

17:07.500 --> 17:09.083
HEATHER (chuckles):
Uh, well, Rita, hey.

17:09.166 --> 17:10.125
That's my seat.

17:10.208 --> 17:12.166
MATT:
Okay.

17:12.250 --> 17:13.750
How about some salad?

17:13.834 --> 17:15.166
-Huh? Mmm, mmm, mmm.
-Ooh. Mmm.

17:15.250 --> 17:16.875
Ooh, yum!

17:16.959 --> 17:18.667
Wasn't that just in the trash?

17:18.750 --> 17:21.458
Oh, nope. Not all of it.

17:21.542 --> 17:23.208
Okay.

17:28.500 --> 17:30.417
Matt! Matt! Wake up!

17:30.500 --> 17:31.625
Is she back?

17:31.709 --> 17:32.792
No. Not yet.

17:32.875 --> 17:34.375
Why do you keep waking me up
every ten minutes

17:34.458 --> 17:35.834
to tell me she's not back yet?

17:35.917 --> 17:38.709
Because I am worried, and I
need you to be worried with me.

17:38.792 --> 17:40.709
It's 4:00 a.m., and
Rita's still missing.

17:40.792 --> 17:42.542
Unless she's been gone
for at least 48 hours,

17:42.625 --> 17:44.083
she's not technically
considered missing.

17:44.166 --> 17:45.792
I learned that
from watching all those shows

17:45.875 --> 17:47.125
where the girl ends up dead.

17:47.208 --> 17:49.333
-(gasps)
-Oh, crap.

17:49.417 --> 17:52.041
Yeah, exactly. She could be
lying in a ditch somewhere.

17:52.125 --> 17:54.125
Or-or, worse, she could
be finding another sister

17:54.208 --> 17:56.041
to be a surrogate for.

17:56.125 --> 17:58.458
-Oh, honey. Come here.
Come here, come here, come here.

17:56.125 --> 17:58.458
-(whimpers)

17:58.542 --> 18:01.375
I'm sure that
she's probably not dead.

18:01.458 --> 18:03.125
-(women laughing)
-RITA: Wait, shh!

18:03.208 --> 18:05.583
My sister and her old husband
are probably asleep.

18:05.667 --> 18:08.875
Hi. No, we're awake.
And roughly the same age.

18:08.959 --> 18:11.542
It looks like you had fun,
so that's good.

18:11.625 --> 18:13.041
Yeah. It was so good.

18:13.125 --> 18:15.583
This guy that I let feel
me up called me pretty.

18:16.542 --> 18:17.709
Isn't that sweet?

18:17.792 --> 18:19.000
KIM:
And the bar closed at 2:00,

18:19.083 --> 18:21.083
but the bartender had
this really cool van

18:21.166 --> 18:22.750
he let us drive around in.

18:22.834 --> 18:24.959
He gave me a tattoo.
(chuckles)

18:25.041 --> 18:27.542
I can't wait to see what it is.

18:27.625 --> 18:30.166
Well, I'm just glad
you're home safe and sound.

18:30.250 --> 18:32.667
Except for you, dear.
You may have hepatitis.

18:32.750 --> 18:33.750
Okay.

18:33.834 --> 18:34.792
It's, uh, it's time
to hit the sack.

18:34.875 --> 18:36.083
Let's go. Come on.

18:36.166 --> 18:38.083
Oh. No, we're actually
just coming back here

18:38.166 --> 18:40.291
to change and then go back
out. Or we could party here.

18:40.375 --> 18:42.583
I mean, it depends on
what you guys are planning.

18:42.667 --> 18:46.333
Are you, like, gonna stay or...?

18:46.417 --> 18:49.375
'Cause we definitely didn't
buy enough to share.

18:49.458 --> 18:50.792
Am I still sleeping
right now?

18:50.875 --> 18:52.291
No, no. You're wide awake.

18:52.375 --> 18:54.583
And now you're mad,
because I'm mad.

18:54.667 --> 18:56.500
Rita, this is unacceptable.

18:56.583 --> 18:58.250
You cannot be acting
like a child

18:58.333 --> 19:00.375
when you're supposed to be
having one for us.

19:00.458 --> 19:02.667
Ooh, Rita, I think
your mom is pissed.

19:02.750 --> 19:04.417
You agreed to take care
of yourself,

19:04.500 --> 19:06.000
and you are doing
the exact opposite.

19:06.083 --> 19:07.625
And, Matt,
you're supposed to be mad,

19:07.709 --> 19:08.959
and you're not doing anything.

19:09.041 --> 19:10.542
She is not Rita's mom, okay?

19:10.625 --> 19:12.125
Yeah.

19:12.208 --> 19:13.709
What, you don't think
I'm taking care of myself?

19:13.792 --> 19:15.834
No, Rita!
And we're sick of it!

19:15.917 --> 19:19.250
Well, if you're sick of it,
you can find another surrogate!

19:22.291 --> 19:24.041
What does it pay?

19:24.125 --> 19:27.208
And do I have to sleep
with Rita's dad?

19:38.375 --> 19:40.542
Rita, what are you doing?

19:40.625 --> 19:42.291
I'm leaving.
This was a huge mistake.

19:42.375 --> 19:43.834
Why are you acting like this?

19:43.917 --> 19:45.333
I don't even know
if I can get pregnant.

19:45.417 --> 19:48.333
What if my womb is too tiny
and it squeezes the baby

19:48.417 --> 19:51.000
and the baby comes out
too small or, like, too big?

19:51.083 --> 19:54.291
The pressure to give you
this baby... (sighs)

19:54.375 --> 19:56.417
I don't want to disappoint you.

19:56.500 --> 19:58.000
No, no, you won't.

19:58.083 --> 20:00.583
Because just offering
to be our surrogate

20:00.667 --> 20:03.959
is the most incredible thing
anyone has ever done for me.

20:04.041 --> 20:05.792
And Matt one time
bought me earrings

20:05.875 --> 20:07.250
he thought were diamonds.

20:07.333 --> 20:10.291
(chuckles)
And if it doesn't happen?

20:10.375 --> 20:12.625
Then it doesn't.

20:12.709 --> 20:15.583
At least I still have this
special bond with my sister.

20:19.083 --> 20:21.750
(snoring)

20:21.834 --> 20:25.375
-He's the same amount
of happy as me.

20:21.834 --> 20:25.375
-Mm.
