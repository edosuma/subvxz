00:02.128 --> 00:03.618
D'Argo:
Previously on Farscape.

00:03.713 --> 00:05.419
You are not going to die.

00:05.506 --> 00:08.669
The only treatment is a tissue
graft from a genetically
compatible donor.

00:14.348 --> 00:15.758
Gilina.

00:15.850 --> 00:19.263
If a warrior cannot die in
battle, she can at
least die alone.

00:19.353 --> 00:22.595
One dose, some bed rest.

00:22.690 --> 00:25.978
This may help stabilize you
until Crichton returns
with the cure.

00:31.240 --> 00:32.616
lam Scorpius.

00:36.162 --> 00:37.242
What the hell was that?

00:37.330 --> 00:38.911
A memory.

00:38.998 --> 00:44.083
Our spy has an interest in
wormhole technology.

00:44.170 --> 00:47.128
And you can have Crichton when
l have finished with him.

00:47.215 --> 00:48.546
We've got to get you
out of there.

00:48.633 --> 00:50.294
Get the sample back to Moya.

00:50.384 --> 00:51.840
Does Aeryn mean that
much to him?

00:51.928 --> 00:53.293
Crichton is in love with you.

00:53.387 --> 00:54.502
Crichton succeeded.

00:54.597 --> 00:55.837
Where is he? I want to see him.

00:55.932 --> 00:56.842
My side, your side!

00:56.933 --> 00:58.264
My side, your side!

00:58.351 --> 01:01.593
Danger, Will Robinson.

01:01.687 --> 01:04.394
Beware the chair.

01:18.329 --> 01:20.035
Why the yotz are we still here?

01:20.122 --> 01:21.862
The Prowler's on board,
isn't it?

01:21.958 --> 01:24.165
We should Starburst away from
here before Crais finds out
where we are.

01:24.252 --> 01:27.369
Pilot:
We can't.
Starburst is not available.

01:27.463 --> 01:29.294
Nor is propulsion.

01:29.382 --> 01:32.044
We will be fortunate just
to maintain orbit.

01:32.134 --> 01:35.342
But, Pilot, I thought Moya
was prepared for one
more Starburst.

01:35.429 --> 01:38.136
She was, but no longer.

01:38.224 --> 01:41.762
She has gone into what
appears to be full labor.

01:41.852 --> 01:44.514
She chooses now to
go into labor?

01:44.605 --> 01:45.936
It's a little inconvenient.

01:46.023 --> 01:49.436
She has little choice.
And she is very frightened.

01:49.527 --> 01:52.189
Pilot, that's a natural reaction
during a birthing cycle.

01:52.280 --> 01:55.522
Moya tells me that this is not
a natural birthing cycle.

01:55.616 --> 02:01.862
She's now certain that there is
something wrong with her child.

02:02.748 --> 02:06.286
It is not a normal Leviathan.

02:20.516 --> 02:22.347
How are you feeling?

02:23.602 --> 02:25.263
Better.

02:25.354 --> 02:26.560
Lie back down.

02:26.647 --> 02:29.309
It may be some time before your
strength returns completely.

02:29.400 --> 02:32.016
I hear I have you to
thank for my life.

02:32.111 --> 02:35.103
Yeah. Oh, and, uh,
the other one.

02:35.197 --> 02:36.733
What other one?

02:36.824 --> 02:37.609
Gilina.

02:37.700 --> 02:39.190
Or don't you remember her?

02:39.285 --> 02:42.072
We met on the Zelbinion.

02:42.872 --> 02:44.032
Where's Crichton?

02:44.123 --> 02:45.158
You should rest now, Aeryn.

02:45.249 --> 02:46.159
Where is he?

02:46.250 --> 02:48.081
Crichton's still on
the Gammak Base.

02:48.169 --> 02:50.160
He's been captured by
the Peacekeepers.

02:50.254 --> 02:53.166
They're probing his mind using
something called an
Aurora Chair.

02:53.257 --> 02:55.623
Why didn't anyone tell me?
Why haven't you gone after him?

02:55.718 --> 02:59.427
There are hundreds of
Peacekeepers down there, Aeryn.

02:59.513 --> 03:02.755
I cannot infiltrate that base
without being detected.

03:02.850 --> 03:04.681
Well, I can.

03:06.228 --> 03:08.355
(groaning)

03:08.439 --> 03:09.724
(gasping)

03:13.486 --> 03:15.226
Don't try to stop me, D'Argo.

03:15.321 --> 03:16.276
I won't.

03:16.364 --> 03:17.774
l'm strong enough to go alone.

03:17.865 --> 03:19.901
No, you're not.
I'm coming with you.

03:19.992 --> 03:22.278
If you can be an idiot,
I can be an idiot.

03:22.370 --> 03:24.782
Well, a warrior may be of some
use to me down there

03:24.872 --> 03:27.284
but Zhaan, why don't
you stay here?

03:27.375 --> 03:30.208
John might need me. If he gets
damaged by the chair then
I can help him.

03:30.294 --> 03:33.786
I'm hoping Crichton will be
strong enough to fight
the chair.

03:37.676 --> 03:39.541
...bre|l phase distortion.

03:39.637 --> 03:41.047
Flight recorder getting
all this?

03:41.138 --> 03:42.719
What do you call the maneuver
we're doing now?

03:42.807 --> 03:43.796
Slingshot.

03:43.891 --> 03:45.973
Holy mother, it's a wormhole.

03:46.060 --> 03:47.345
...it's unstable.

03:50.481 --> 03:53.188
( screaming )

03:53.275 --> 03:54.981
Crais:
There's no use
resisting, Crichton.

03:55.069 --> 03:57.481
The chair will rip the memories
from you, even if you fight it.

03:57.571 --> 04:00.108
I'm not resisting.

04:00.199 --> 04:01.359
The chair says he is.

04:01.450 --> 04:02.610
He's holding something back.

04:02.701 --> 04:05.033
Crais:
Then increase the extraction.

04:12.211 --> 04:13.621
Show us what you're blocking!

04:13.712 --> 04:16.294
I'm not blocking.

04:20.469 --> 04:23.211
(strained laughter)

04:23.305 --> 04:25.682
About wormholes.

04:27.059 --> 04:28.435
( screaming )

04:35.276 --> 04:37.517
My name is John Crichton,
an astronaut...

04:37.611 --> 04:40.819
...a radiation wave hit and I
got shot through a wormhole...

04:40.906 --> 04:43.568
Now I'm lost in some distant
part of the universe on a ship.

04:43.659 --> 04:47.277
A living ship, full of strange
alien life-forms...

04:47.371 --> 04:48.201
Help me.

04:48.289 --> 04:49.449
Listen, please.

04:49.540 --> 04:51.576
Is there anybody out there
who can hear me?

04:51.667 --> 04:55.785
...being hunted by an insane
military commander...

04:55.880 --> 04:58.087
...doing everything I can...

04:58.174 --> 05:00.586
I'm just looking for
a way home.

05:39.215 --> 05:40.921
(faint electronic signal )

05:46.263 --> 05:47.378
What are you doing there?

05:47.473 --> 05:49.179
Don't talk to me!

05:49.266 --> 05:50.597
Stay!

05:50.684 --> 05:52.265
You stay where you are!

05:52.353 --> 05:53.809
Don't talk to me!

05:53.896 --> 05:56.262
There's no talking to me!

05:56.357 --> 05:59.349
I do my talking in the chair.

05:59.944 --> 06:01.559
Ah.

06:04.406 --> 06:06.317
You like the chair?

06:06.408 --> 06:09.775
Love the chair, love the chair,
love the chair.

06:09.870 --> 06:12.282
Are you spying on me, Stark?

06:15.417 --> 06:19.205
Scorpy sent you in here
to spy on me?

06:19.296 --> 06:22.083
No, I'm no spy for Scorpy.

06:22.174 --> 06:23.380
What you got there?

06:23.467 --> 06:24.707
Nothing. Nothing.

06:24.802 --> 06:25.666
What is that?

06:25.761 --> 06:27.001
No!

06:27.763 --> 06:29.128
Stop.

06:29.223 --> 06:33.011
If you don't stop, I'm going
to have to kill you.

06:33.102 --> 06:34.808
Give it a couple days.

06:34.895 --> 06:39.059
I think Scorpy and Peacekeeper
Barbie will do it for you.

06:40.317 --> 06:42.057
(growling)

06:53.372 --> 06:55.203
You're not crazy.

06:55.833 --> 06:57.448
Are you, Stark?

06:57.543 --> 06:59.408
No.

07:00.045 --> 07:02.036
But if they think I am,

07:03.090 --> 07:05.672
they don't bother me so much.

07:07.303 --> 07:09.544
So what you hiding there?

07:10.973 --> 07:12.929
My baby.

07:18.397 --> 07:20.604
It's a magnetic crypt encoder.

07:20.691 --> 07:25.276
I made it from scraps of metal
I've been collecting
for two cycles.

07:26.864 --> 07:28.320
What's it do?

07:28.407 --> 07:33.322
If I get the sequence right,
it can unlock the door.

07:33.412 --> 07:36.495
But it can only try one
sequence at a time.

07:39.084 --> 07:42.417
(laughing)

07:45.549 --> 07:48.165
(coughing)

07:48.260 --> 07:50.751
You're going to be
here forever,

07:50.846 --> 07:54.134
if you're waiting for that
thing to get you out.

07:54.224 --> 07:57.011
At least I'm trying something.

08:03.275 --> 08:04.685
Trash!

08:07.279 --> 08:09.736
You'll tell them about
my baby, won't you?

08:09.823 --> 08:12.235
No.

08:12.326 --> 08:15.284
No, I've kept things
from them this far.

08:15.371 --> 08:17.157
I can keep this.

08:17.247 --> 08:20.455
Everyone can block thoughts
for a while, Crichton,

08:20.542 --> 08:24.660
but eventually you'll
tell the chair.

08:24.755 --> 08:27.713
I'm the only one who can
block thoughts forever.

08:35.099 --> 08:37.590
How many times have you
been in it?

08:37.685 --> 08:39.971
Over one hundred sessions.

08:41.063 --> 08:42.303
Oh.

08:43.273 --> 08:45.685
Well, what is it?

08:45.776 --> 08:49.143
What's so important that you
can keep it from the chair?

08:49.822 --> 08:51.483
What do you know?

08:53.367 --> 08:55.483
Nothin'.

08:55.577 --> 08:58.614
l'm tellin' 'em the truth.

08:58.706 --> 09:05.077
What I'm blocking has nothing
to do with the wormholes!

09:20.936 --> 09:22.176
Are you all right?

09:22.271 --> 09:24.057
I'm fine.

09:24.148 --> 09:27.140
Any sign they've
spotted us, D'Argo?

09:27.234 --> 09:28.849
Nothing's tracking.

09:28.944 --> 09:31.356
The scanning blind that Gilina
created seems to be holding.

09:31.447 --> 09:33.028
Let's hope so.

09:36.201 --> 09:37.190
Zhaan:
What about when we land?

09:37.286 --> 09:39.197
There won't be any
sensors up top.

09:39.288 --> 09:42.200
The sensors would give away
that there's a Gammak Base
underground.

09:56.263 --> 09:57.799
Distorted voice:
John!

09:57.890 --> 09:58.800
Who's there?

09:58.891 --> 09:59.880
John? John?

09:59.975 --> 10:01.340
Where's that voice coming from?

10:01.435 --> 10:02.345
Shut up!

10:02.436 --> 10:04.301
Don't say a word.

10:06.482 --> 10:07.597
Crichton:
Gilina?

10:07.691 --> 10:10.182
John, keep your back
to the camera.

10:10.277 --> 10:12.268
They can see but they
can't hear.

10:12.362 --> 10:14.978
I remember. I... I remember.

10:15.073 --> 10:17.155
Did you get the paraphoral
tissue to Aeryn?

10:17.242 --> 10:18.982
Chiana got it off the base,

10:19.077 --> 10:20.817
but I don't know if she made it
back to Moya in time.

10:20.913 --> 10:22.619
Who is that?
Who you talking to?

10:22.706 --> 10:26.665
It's a friend. She can help
us get out of here.

10:26.752 --> 10:28.959
Now we both have a
secret to keep.

10:29.046 --> 10:33.164
Gilina, I need some help.

10:33.258 --> 10:36.876
I need you to get them
off my back for awhile.

10:36.970 --> 10:39.131
I'll think of something.

10:40.349 --> 10:42.431
John, don't worry.

10:42.518 --> 10:43.974
I've got to go now.

10:44.061 --> 10:46.222
I can't stay tapped
in for long.

10:46.313 --> 10:47.644
Thanks.

11:02.454 --> 11:05.787
(rumbling)

11:07.918 --> 11:13.163
Pilot:
Moya's data stores indicate it
may be best to get the offspring out as fast as possible.

11:13.257 --> 11:15.122
How the yotz do we do that?

11:15.217 --> 11:19.586
It says we can try blasting the
tranix with coolant from Moya's
thermal chamber.

11:19.680 --> 11:21.045
Then do it.

11:21.139 --> 11:23.130
I want this thing over with.
I want to be still...

11:23.225 --> 11:25.762
Rygel! You've got to stay
calm during the birth.

11:25.853 --> 11:27.684
lam calm. l...

11:27.771 --> 11:30.353
I've conceived hundreds
of progeny.

11:30.440 --> 11:32.271
And those are only the official
ones with my wives.

11:32.359 --> 11:34.099
Well then, you should know
something about this.

11:34.194 --> 11:35.309
Or you should be able
to help us.

11:35.404 --> 11:37.895
I was never present
at the birth.

11:37.990 --> 11:39.651
Not one.

11:39.741 --> 11:41.197
Well, of course not.

11:41.285 --> 11:43.901
I think this is a trifle
different, don't you?

11:43.996 --> 11:45.702
My progeny were tiny.

11:45.789 --> 11:48.701
Tiny and handsome.
Like their father.

11:48.792 --> 11:50.328
(rumbling intensifies)

11:50.419 --> 11:51.829
Oh!

11:53.213 --> 11:55.420
Technician:
Okay, I'm patched in here.
Try it again.

11:55.507 --> 11:57.338
Niem:
Hurry up!

11:57.426 --> 11:59.587
Scorpius wants maximum
power now.

11:59.678 --> 12:02.010
We just have to reroute
the annex cable.

12:02.097 --> 12:03.462
We're onto it.

12:08.854 --> 12:10.310
Alex, you need some help?

12:10.397 --> 12:14.686
Oh, hi Gilina.
Yeah, you're not wrong.

12:14.776 --> 12:17.233
Uh, if you put the double
cabling on-Iine,

12:17.321 --> 12:18.936
uh, I can finish patching in.

12:19.031 --> 12:21.568
Oh, sure, all right
then, well...

12:21.658 --> 12:23.194
you know all this
better than me.

12:23.285 --> 12:24.866
-Mmm.
-Mmm.

12:24.953 --> 12:26.329
Thanks.

12:33.253 --> 12:36.370
( beeping )

12:36.465 --> 12:38.205
Niem:
Status report.
Are we back on-line?

12:38.300 --> 12:41.212
Technician:
Checking power levels now.
Just a few microts.

12:53.857 --> 12:54.972
Niem:
Are we ready?

12:55.067 --> 12:56.398
Technician:
All levels are go.

13:04.368 --> 13:07.030
Technician:
Calibration complete.

13:07.120 --> 13:09.452
Niem:
The chair is ready, Scorpius.

13:09.539 --> 13:10.745
Good.

13:12.834 --> 13:14.699
Follow us.

13:41.238 --> 13:42.978
Come on... come on...

13:44.116 --> 13:45.356
Gilina:
John!

13:46.660 --> 13:48.241
Gilina.

13:48.328 --> 13:49.989
I can't talk right now.

13:50.080 --> 13:52.036
Looks like we got company.

13:52.124 --> 13:55.912
John, when you get into the
chairjust remember one thing.

13:56.003 --> 13:57.163
What?

13:57.254 --> 13:58.494
Remember when we kissed
on the Zelbinion.

13:58.588 --> 14:00.249
No. No, no, no, that's the
thing I'm blocking.

14:00.340 --> 14:01.045
Trust me.

14:01.133 --> 14:03.294
I do trust you. I do.

14:03.385 --> 14:05.091
-Then remember the kiss.
-Scorpy!

14:05.178 --> 14:07.089
-Move back, Stark! Get inside!
-But Scorpy, let me get
into the chair!

14:07.180 --> 14:10.297
Scorpy! Will Scorpy let me
get into the chair?

14:17.941 --> 14:18.896
Have you finished?

14:18.984 --> 14:20.190
Yes.

14:20.861 --> 14:22.943
You see, Crichton,

14:25.323 --> 14:27.063
this is what I'm trying
to keep you from.

14:27.159 --> 14:30.492
Yeah, Scorpy. You're all heart.

14:38.628 --> 14:41.791
You show me everything
that's in your brain

14:41.882 --> 14:43.167
and I won't torture you anymore.

14:43.258 --> 14:44.668
I've shown you everything.

14:44.760 --> 14:47.342
The chair indicates that you're
holding something back.

14:47.429 --> 14:49.215
Chair's wrong.

14:50.849 --> 14:53.056
What won't you tell me?

14:54.394 --> 14:56.350
I already know everything else.

14:56.438 --> 14:59.805
I know you're living on a
stolen Leviathan with
escaped prisoners,

14:59.900 --> 15:02.562
and I know that Leviathan
is pregnant.

15:02.652 --> 15:04.313
You know who the Daddy is?

15:04.404 --> 15:07.362
(laughing)

15:09.534 --> 15:11.820
Why are you doing this
to yourself?

15:11.912 --> 15:14.779
What is so important

15:14.873 --> 15:18.616
that you're willing to go
through all of this?

15:22.631 --> 15:25.293
I'm not blocking anything.

15:28.887 --> 15:30.752
Bring him.

15:35.602 --> 15:39.720
I'm going to enjoy ripping the
truth out of you, Crichton.

15:45.695 --> 15:47.822
(screaming and gasping)

16:01.878 --> 16:03.539
Commander Crichton,

16:03.630 --> 16:06.372
it's good to see you're
enjoying your stay with us.

16:08.593 --> 16:11.756
Crais, don't you ever knock?

16:11.847 --> 16:13.087
Stop!

16:19.187 --> 16:20.848
What is that?

16:20.939 --> 16:22.770
My question as well, Captain.

16:27.404 --> 16:29.269
(electronic tone intensifies )

16:32.784 --> 16:34.570
What do you want?

16:34.661 --> 16:36.276
I'm here to thank you.

16:36.371 --> 16:37.702
Yeah?

16:37.789 --> 16:39.529
For what?

16:40.792 --> 16:42.953
I've never been one
of the elite.

16:43.044 --> 16:44.580
Did you know that?

16:44.671 --> 16:47.333
My parents were common farmers.

16:47.424 --> 16:51.167
I was shanghaied from their
commune as a young boy.

16:51.261 --> 16:55.254
I rose through Peacekeeper
ranks on my wits and my hatred.

16:55.348 --> 16:57.304
But still, some doors were
always closed to me.

16:57.392 --> 17:01.556
Well, thanks for the family
tree, Crais, but frankly,
I don't give a damn.

17:02.898 --> 17:06.561
With this wormhole information
you've given me

17:06.651 --> 17:09.859
I now have the power to rise
where I should be.

17:15.952 --> 17:18.364
You don't actually believe
any of that, do you?

17:19.247 --> 17:20.453
Come on, he made it all up!

17:20.540 --> 17:23.703
You can't make things up
for the chair, Captain.

17:23.793 --> 17:25.249
You know that.

17:33.595 --> 17:36.007
What is that, hmm?

17:36.806 --> 17:38.592
Crichton:
I don't know.

17:38.683 --> 17:41.595
Kind of looks like an episode
of Melrose Place.

17:42.938 --> 17:45.054
What do you mean you don't
know what it is?

17:45.148 --> 17:46.479
I don't know.

17:46.566 --> 17:48.682
Damn! What is it?

17:53.907 --> 17:56.193
Is that it, Crais?

17:56.868 --> 17:57.948
Is the game up?

17:58.036 --> 17:59.276
What?

17:59.371 --> 18:03.831
Crais, first found out about
wormholes when I came through.

18:03.917 --> 18:06.954
I gave him the information disk
in exchange for my life.

18:07.045 --> 18:08.410
That's a lie!

18:13.802 --> 18:15.884
No, it's not.

18:15.971 --> 18:17.302
He's lying!

18:17.389 --> 18:18.549
Damn you, Crichton!

18:18.640 --> 18:20.471
Tell him the truth!

18:24.604 --> 18:28.517
So, nothing of what we
saw was true?

18:28.608 --> 18:29.643
No.

18:29.734 --> 18:31.144
Were you born on a
farming commune?

18:31.236 --> 18:32.601
Yes.

18:32.696 --> 18:34.652
Were you conscripted from it
by the Peacekeepers?

18:34.739 --> 18:35.649
Yes, but...

18:35.740 --> 18:36.946
How does Crichton know this?

18:37.033 --> 18:38.364
He must have stolen it
from a database...

18:38.451 --> 18:40.191
While in security three
containment?

18:40.287 --> 18:43.779
Look, I don't know how he did
it, but what you saw on
there is not true.

18:43.873 --> 18:45.909
Of course, it's not.

18:47.627 --> 18:50.960
But there's only one way
to be sure it is a lie.

18:51.047 --> 18:52.583
How?

18:52.674 --> 18:54.665
For you to go in the chair.

18:56.094 --> 18:57.129
( chuckles )

18:57.220 --> 18:58.130
Me?

18:58.221 --> 19:00.712
Yes.

19:00.807 --> 19:04.265
No captain has ever been
subjected to such an indignity.

19:04.352 --> 19:06.343
There's always a first
for everything.

19:08.315 --> 19:10.351
Get Crichton back to his cell.

19:10.442 --> 19:12.433
You overstep yourself, Scorpius.

19:12.527 --> 19:15.018
You haven't got the numbers
to put me in the chair.

19:15.113 --> 19:16.899
Don't I?

19:21.619 --> 19:24.361
I commend your loyalty.

19:24.456 --> 19:28.665
It must be difficult to maintain
for an officer like Crais,

19:28.752 --> 19:31.209
an officer on the edge
and out of control.

19:31.296 --> 19:33.161
Talk to me, Scorpius,
not to them.

19:33.256 --> 19:36.794
I have unconditional authority
on a Gammak Base.

19:38.386 --> 19:42.379
Captain Crais will go
to the chair.

19:42.474 --> 19:46.717
To stop that, you will
have to kill me.

19:48.313 --> 19:50.429
And all my men.

19:50.523 --> 19:52.024
Are you prepared to do that?

19:52.108 --> 19:54.099
Do not listen to him.
That is an order.

19:54.194 --> 19:57.106
Do what you know in your
hearts if the right thing.

20:00.950 --> 20:03.111
Put Crais in the chair.

20:17.217 --> 20:21.631
That's the last of the gear
from the Transport Pod.

20:21.721 --> 20:23.257
What are you doing with
those explosives?

20:23.348 --> 20:26.135
I'm upgrading these
primitive things.

20:26.226 --> 20:27.716
I found an access shaft.

20:27.811 --> 20:30.348
I should be able to get to the
base and look for Crichton.

20:30.438 --> 20:31.723
Are you strong enough?

20:31.815 --> 20:33.646
I better be.

20:43.952 --> 20:45.738
Stop.

21:35.378 --> 21:37.118
(Crichton coughing )

21:37.213 --> 21:40.125
I don't know how she did it.

21:40.216 --> 21:42.753
But She did it.

21:44.179 --> 21:45.544
Rest, Crichton.

21:45.638 --> 21:48.755
No. No, no, no, we've got
to do something.

21:48.850 --> 21:51.683
I gotta get that door open.

21:51.769 --> 21:54.181
(gasping)

22:09.746 --> 22:11.327
Here.

22:21.090 --> 22:22.921
What is that?

22:23.009 --> 22:24.510
What did you just show me?

22:24.594 --> 22:27.461
I'm able to give a few
thoughts, that's all.

22:28.139 --> 22:29.754
Rest, my friend.

22:48.701 --> 22:50.441
How long have you been here?

22:50.537 --> 22:53.028
Two cycles.

22:53.122 --> 22:55.158
Peacekeepers killed most
of my people,

22:55.250 --> 22:59.664
but they kept me alive
because I interest them.

22:59.754 --> 23:03.997
I'm able to hide thoughts that
their chair can't touch.

23:04.092 --> 23:05.798
It's almost ironic.

23:05.885 --> 23:09.969
What made me a slave now
keeps me alive.

23:10.056 --> 23:11.671
What made you a slave?

23:12.642 --> 23:14.849
This.

23:14.936 --> 23:18.178
I'm of the Banik slave race.

23:18.273 --> 23:20.309
Outsiders think that we
do not feel

23:20.400 --> 23:24.769
but it's only that our feelings
don't always show.

23:24.862 --> 23:29.071
Just as this can hide
our feelings.

23:29.158 --> 23:33.026
We're also able to cloud
thoughts from our minds.

23:35.248 --> 23:38.365
What I know deep inside,

23:38.459 --> 23:41.917
Peacekeepers will never see.

23:47.427 --> 23:49.167
I did everything I could
to avoid him!

23:49.262 --> 23:52.220
The recruiter is here
to pick you up.

23:52.307 --> 23:54.263
I'm counting on you to
protect him.

23:54.350 --> 23:55.760
Do you understand?

23:55.852 --> 23:56.432
Bialar!

23:56.519 --> 23:58.384
( screaming )

24:01.566 --> 24:03.397
Who is that?

24:06.321 --> 24:08.277
My father!

24:09.657 --> 24:11.864
Turn it off!

24:11.951 --> 24:14.112
Don't you like your past, Crais?

24:14.203 --> 24:16.364
Turn it off!

24:20.209 --> 24:22.336
Can't you get to what he knows
about wormholes?

24:22.420 --> 24:24.001
No. He's fighting it.

24:24.088 --> 24:25.953
( screaming )

24:31.012 --> 24:35.221
I don't know anything!

24:52.659 --> 24:53.899
Sir.

25:08.341 --> 25:10.957
Is there surveillance
inside this cell?

25:11.052 --> 25:12.883
No.

25:16.265 --> 25:17.641
Aeryn.

25:26.234 --> 25:29.101
Chiana told me what you
did for me.

25:29.195 --> 25:30.150
Thank you.

25:30.238 --> 25:32.103
What are you doing here?

25:32.198 --> 25:35.235
The paraphoral tissue takes at
least ten solar days before...

25:35.326 --> 25:38.443
I don't have ten days. I need
to know where Crichton is.

25:38.538 --> 25:42.030
They have him on level
nine containment.

25:42.125 --> 25:46.915
There is no way of reaching him
without a direct order
from Scorpius.

25:47.004 --> 25:49.541
John is blocking a memory
from them.

25:49.632 --> 25:54.296
Scorpius thinks it has something
to do with his precious
wormholes, but it doesn't.

25:54.387 --> 25:56.753
What does it have to do with?

25:57.223 --> 25:58.463
Me.

25:59.225 --> 26:01.341
He's protecting me,

26:01.436 --> 26:06.226
but as soon as Scorpius finds
out that he knows nothing
about wormholes,

26:06.315 --> 26:10.149
he'll kill him.

26:10.236 --> 26:13.103
We'll need more rocks if we're
going to hide the rest of
these, D'Argo.

26:13.197 --> 26:15.449
If the Peacekeepers come up
through the level risers,

26:15.533 --> 26:17.148
this is where they're
going to surface.

26:17.243 --> 26:19.154
I hope those things work.

26:19.245 --> 26:23.329
Otherwise, there is not much to
stand between us and them.

26:23.416 --> 26:26.249
I always wanted to ask
you, D'Argo.

26:26.335 --> 26:28.200
That Qualta blade.

26:28.296 --> 26:32.335
For a warrior, it seems a very
unconventional weapon.

26:32.425 --> 26:36.759
Many cycles ago, there was a
race even more feared than
the Peacekeepers.

26:36.846 --> 26:38.882
The Teloks.

26:38.973 --> 26:42.511
They laid siege to my planet for
over one hundred solar days.

26:42.602 --> 26:49.474
When the final assault came,
all our warriors had were these
unconventional weapons.

26:49.567 --> 26:53.606
My own great grandfather
died in that war.

26:53.696 --> 26:59.987
When the final days come,
Luxans believe that the Qualta
blade will lead us to freedom.

27:00.828 --> 27:02.989
I understand, D'Argo.

27:03.080 --> 27:06.288
Please forgive my curiosity.

27:06.375 --> 27:09.583
There is another thing we
can do for you.

27:10.254 --> 27:11.585
What?

27:11.672 --> 27:15.335
My Qualta blade and I can
cut stones for you.

27:21.265 --> 27:24.348
Look, I'm not going to say
this again. There is
nothing in there.

27:24.435 --> 27:26.721
Aeryn:
I'm just telling you what I
picked up from Crais' carrier.

27:26.813 --> 27:28.769
-What's going on?
-Shh.

27:28.856 --> 27:31.233
I detected an unauthorized
magnetic pulse coming from
somewhere on this...

27:31.317 --> 27:33.899
There is no signal coming
from in there.

27:33.986 --> 27:34.771
Mm-hmm.

27:34.862 --> 27:37.319
Look, I'll prove it to you.

27:39.575 --> 27:42.362
See? Nothing.
Absolutely nothing.

27:42.453 --> 27:43.693
( beeping )

27:43.788 --> 27:44.652
What the frell is that?

27:44.747 --> 27:46.408
Obviously nothing.

27:46.499 --> 27:48.831
(trilling)

27:52.421 --> 27:54.286
(device beeping faster)

27:54.382 --> 27:56.213
Get out of it, Stark.

27:57.969 --> 27:59.379
How could you?

28:00.388 --> 28:01.628
You were right.

28:01.722 --> 28:03.223
I'll move him to another cell.

28:03.307 --> 28:04.467
They don't need to be moved.

28:04.559 --> 28:05.344
Why not?

28:05.434 --> 28:06.685
Because they're coming with me.

28:06.769 --> 28:08.760
She's with me!

28:09.814 --> 28:11.020
Who is she?

28:11.107 --> 28:15.020
That is the radiant Aeryn Sun.

28:15.111 --> 28:17.773
Stark:
How many Peacekeepers do you
know on this base?

28:17.864 --> 28:19.229
Are you all right, Crichton?

28:19.323 --> 28:20.824
Yeah.

28:20.908 --> 28:22.114
How you doin'?

28:22.201 --> 28:24.192
I'm better now.

28:25.538 --> 28:27.324
Come on. We'd better go.

28:27.415 --> 28:28.780
Sorry.

28:31.794 --> 28:36.584
And no one outside this chamber
knows of the Admiral's orders.

28:43.389 --> 28:44.720
(gasps )

28:47.226 --> 28:50.514
So now I know why you tried
to fight the chair.

28:50.605 --> 28:51.720
Hmm.

28:51.814 --> 28:53.179
Are there any more barriers?

28:53.274 --> 28:55.310
No, that's what he was
fighting to hold.

28:55.401 --> 28:57.733
And what Crichton saw
about wormholes?

28:57.820 --> 28:59.651
Is not in this captain's memory.

28:59.739 --> 29:02.572
Computer:
Level one security breach.

29:04.285 --> 29:05.650
This is Scorpius.

29:05.745 --> 29:08.202
Guard:
Sir, the human prisoner
has escaped.

29:08.289 --> 29:09.495
How?

29:09.582 --> 29:11.743
There's a Peacekeeper
working with him.

29:11.834 --> 29:14.166
Seal the base, everything.

29:14.253 --> 29:16.244
He must not reach the surface.

29:18.132 --> 29:19.747
It's clear, come on.

29:21.427 --> 29:23.258
Go. Go. Go.

29:27.558 --> 29:29.094
You first.

29:31.687 --> 29:32.676
Peacekeepers.

29:32.772 --> 29:35.104
Come on. This way.

29:36.317 --> 29:37.067
Just go.

29:37.151 --> 29:38.231
Come on.

29:43.449 --> 29:45.030
In here.

30:07.598 --> 30:09.384
Keep searching.

30:26.909 --> 30:28.115
Pilot:
Oh, no.

30:28.202 --> 30:29.908
What do you mean, "oh, no"?

30:29.996 --> 30:33.409
To give birth, Moya must
equalize pressure with her
outside environment.

30:33.499 --> 30:35.455
You mean, you mean with space?

30:35.543 --> 30:37.909
What? Moya has to make
a vacuum into here?

30:38.004 --> 30:39.744
Yes. I can't stop her.

30:39.839 --> 30:41.124
How much time do we have?

30:41.215 --> 30:43.922
I don't know.
Maybe eighteen microts.

30:44.010 --> 30:46.251
Eighteen microts!
Well, where do we go?

30:46.345 --> 30:47.255
My den's stable.

30:47.346 --> 30:48.722
That's lucky for you,
isn't it, prabakto?

30:48.806 --> 30:51.138
We can't get to you in
eighteen microts.

30:51.225 --> 30:53.557
There are pressure tanks in
Maintenance Bay six.

30:53.644 --> 30:56.181
I suggest you go. Go now.

30:56.272 --> 30:58.183
( screaming )

31:06.407 --> 31:07.988
(grunting)

31:08.075 --> 31:09.315
It's locked.

31:09.410 --> 31:10.616
Pilot, it's locked!

31:11.203 --> 31:13.068
Yes, it is, my dear.

31:13.164 --> 31:14.244
There's plenty of room in here.

31:14.331 --> 31:15.286
I'm not getting in there.

31:15.374 --> 31:16.534
That's all there is.

31:16.625 --> 31:20.163
Get inside. You only have
ten microts.

31:23.841 --> 31:26.173
Alright then!

31:26.260 --> 31:29.377
(alarm sounding)

31:33.434 --> 31:35.470
Right. Any other ways
off the base?

31:35.561 --> 31:36.846
They're sealing all the
access shafts.

31:36.937 --> 31:38.438
It means they're shutting
down everything.

31:38.522 --> 31:40.262
There's got to be some
way out of here.

31:40.357 --> 31:43.440
No way. Everything else, even
the lock theyjust put on,

31:43.527 --> 31:46.394
you need an ldent Chip from
a senior officer.

31:46.489 --> 31:48.855
All right, let's go bag a
senior officer.

31:48.949 --> 31:50.860
No, I'll do it, Crichton.

31:50.951 --> 31:53.237
You stay with him.

32:04.256 --> 32:08.750
Excuse me, I'm just making
myself comfortable.

32:08.844 --> 32:11.130
What is that?

32:11.222 --> 32:13.383
Uh, what?

32:14.391 --> 32:15.597
That.

32:15.684 --> 32:18.175
Oh, it's nothing.

32:18.270 --> 32:20.647
Where's your hand, slug-face?

32:20.731 --> 32:22.813
It, it's down there.

32:22.900 --> 32:24.231
(laughing)

32:24.318 --> 32:28.436
I know. Keep it in your
caftan, pal.

32:28.864 --> 32:29.979
Pilot!

32:30.074 --> 32:30.938
Oh...

32:31.033 --> 32:31.818
Pilot!

32:31.909 --> 32:33.524
I'm very busy now, Chiana.

32:33.619 --> 32:34.449
You two okay?

32:34.537 --> 32:36.243
How's Moya?

32:36.330 --> 32:37.866
Oh, yes.

32:37.957 --> 32:40.198
The offspring's coming now.

32:40.292 --> 32:41.953
I can see it.

32:42.044 --> 32:43.124
I must go, Chiana.

32:43.212 --> 32:44.452
(straining)

32:44.547 --> 32:46.128
( breaking wind )

32:46.215 --> 32:47.375
(moans)

32:47.466 --> 32:49.252
( high-pitched voice ):
What was that?

32:49.343 --> 32:52.301
( high-pitched voice ):
Ah, nothing, eh?
Just a bit of helium.

32:52.388 --> 32:54.128
Helium.
-Yes, I...

32:54.223 --> 32:56.339
I don't like being in
confined spaces.

32:56.433 --> 32:58.139
I... I get nervous.

32:58.227 --> 32:59.307
You're disgusting.

32:59.395 --> 33:00.510
Hmm?

33:00.604 --> 33:02.344
( explosion )

33:02.439 --> 33:03.690
(shuddenng)

33:37.808 --> 33:39.048
Captain Crais.

33:39.143 --> 33:41.555
What are you doing
in this chair?

33:41.645 --> 33:43.601
Who's that?

33:43.689 --> 33:45.225
Who's there?

33:45.316 --> 33:49.650
I suppose I shouldn't expect
you to recognize my voice.

33:51.071 --> 33:53.062
Did Scorpius send you?

33:54.200 --> 33:56.441
Release me from this chair.

33:56.535 --> 33:58.116
Why?

33:58.204 --> 34:01.116
So that you can kill me,
the way that you killed
Lieutenant Teeg?

34:01.207 --> 34:03.243
Who...

34:03.334 --> 34:04.494
Who are you?

34:04.585 --> 34:07.748
I am irreversibly contaminated.

34:07.838 --> 34:10.124
Now do you know who I am?

34:13.302 --> 34:16.260
Aeryn Sun.

34:21.644 --> 34:23.509
Does this contaminate
you, Crais?

34:23.604 --> 34:29.975
As a Peacekeeper, you took a
blood oath to obey your
commanding officer.

34:30.069 --> 34:31.479
Till death.
-Yes.

34:31.570 --> 34:33.606
I am still your
commanding officer.

34:33.697 --> 34:35.403
But I am no longer
a Peacekeeper.

34:35.491 --> 34:36.822
You are a Peacekeeper for life!

34:36.909 --> 34:38.149
On the oath you...

34:38.244 --> 34:39.575
Your oath means nothing to me.

34:39.662 --> 34:42.153
You made sure of that.
You destroyed everything.

34:42.248 --> 34:44.239
I lost everything
because of you.

34:44.333 --> 34:45.618
Aeryn Sun...

34:45.709 --> 34:48.166
Do you know what I learned
while I was away from you?

34:48.254 --> 34:51.291
Everything I lost isn't
worth a damn

34:51.382 --> 34:53.293
and I don't want to go
back to your past.

34:53.384 --> 34:54.965
I order you!

34:55.052 --> 34:57.043
You order me?!

35:02.935 --> 35:05.392
You will never order me again.

35:05.479 --> 35:09.597
I will track you down and
kill you, Officer Sun.

35:09.692 --> 35:12.149
On that, I give you my vow!

35:12.236 --> 35:14.227
You know what I give you, Crais?

35:15.489 --> 35:17.400
Your life.

35:20.202 --> 35:22.284
(grunting)

35:24.581 --> 35:28.824
I will make you watch your life.

35:29.461 --> 35:31.497
(electronic whirring )

35:33.215 --> 35:34.250
( screaming )

35:40.889 --> 35:42.720
(screaming continues)

35:53.819 --> 35:55.855
Where's Aeryn?

35:55.946 --> 35:58.323
She should be here by now.

36:03.037 --> 36:05.323
Do you want to be with
her, Crichton?

36:05.831 --> 36:06.820
What?

36:06.915 --> 36:08.997
Do you want to be with
Officer Sun?

36:09.084 --> 36:11.951
(chuckling)

36:15.090 --> 36:17.342
Gilina, can we talk about
this another time?

36:17.426 --> 36:19.087
No.

36:19.178 --> 36:20.964
No, I don't think we can.

36:21.055 --> 36:22.340
You want me to go with you.

36:22.431 --> 36:24.922
You want me to give up
everything I know,

36:25.017 --> 36:28.384
so you must answer me.

36:28.479 --> 36:31.141
Do you want to be with her?

36:34.276 --> 36:35.356
(shuffling sound above)

36:35.444 --> 36:37.184
Aeryn:
Only me. Let's go.

36:37.279 --> 36:39.110
(grunts)

36:39.198 --> 36:42.986
Aeryn, did you bag yourself
a senior officer?

36:43.077 --> 36:45.489
Ran into an old friend.

36:45.579 --> 36:46.864
Let's go.

36:46.955 --> 36:48.741
Let's get out of here.

36:48.832 --> 36:50.368
Okay.

36:51.877 --> 36:53.242
Come on.

36:53.337 --> 36:54.873
Do you want to be with Crichton?

36:54.963 --> 36:56.214
I'm sorry?

36:56.298 --> 36:58.289
He won't answer my question.
Will you?

36:58.384 --> 37:01.091
Gilina, whatever the two of you
have been discussing, it's
none of my business.

37:01.178 --> 37:02.293
-Yes, it is.
-Come on.

37:02.388 --> 37:04.344
He asked me to go with him,

37:04.431 --> 37:06.843
and I cannot do that if
he loves you.

37:06.934 --> 37:08.219
Gilina, you have to
come with us.

37:08.310 --> 37:09.846
If you don't come they
will kill you.

37:09.937 --> 37:11.143
I'll be okay.

37:11.230 --> 37:13.516
Gilina, you've saved my life,
and you know Peacekeepers.

37:13.607 --> 37:15.268
They will come and they
will find you.

37:15.359 --> 37:17.771
I can take care of myself.

37:17.861 --> 37:19.442
You take care of John.

37:20.572 --> 37:22.312
Gilina, tell John.

37:22.408 --> 37:24.649
At least come and talk
to him before...

37:31.625 --> 37:33.536
They used a senior officer's
Ident Chip

37:33.627 --> 37:35.208
and they're climbing the
air vent to the surface.

37:35.295 --> 37:36.546
I thought as much.

37:36.630 --> 37:37.460
Do you want me to burn them out?

37:37.548 --> 37:39.084
No, we need Crichton alive.

37:39.174 --> 37:41.551
We'll take the level risers and
beat them to the surface.

37:41.635 --> 37:43.341
Let's go!

37:46.598 --> 37:48.099
Right.

37:48.183 --> 37:49.172
(men shouting in the distance)

37:49.268 --> 37:50.223
Where's Gilina?

37:50.310 --> 37:51.470
She's not coming with us.

37:51.562 --> 37:53.348
What? What'd you say to her?

37:53.439 --> 37:54.269
I didn't say anything to her.

37:54.356 --> 37:55.937
It's a decision she made
on her own.

37:56.024 --> 37:57.275
I got to get her.

37:57.359 --> 37:59.190
Crichton, we don't have
time for this.

37:59.278 --> 38:01.940
She has gone.
It's what she wants.

38:04.324 --> 38:05.484
Come on.

38:05.576 --> 38:07.362
(electronic chirping)

38:30.017 --> 38:31.928
( Rygel grunting )

38:32.769 --> 38:33.724
(moaning)

38:33.812 --> 38:35.143
( high-pitched voice ):
Pilot!

38:35.230 --> 38:37.141
Pilot, are we
re-pressurized yet?!

38:37.232 --> 38:38.267
Yes.

38:38.358 --> 38:39.518
You can get out now.

38:39.610 --> 38:41.396
(grunts)

38:42.070 --> 38:44.061
(coughing)

38:44.156 --> 38:44.986
Finally.

38:45.073 --> 38:46.609
Chiana, I didn't mean to...

38:46.700 --> 38:48.156
Shut up!

38:48.243 --> 38:50.495
Something's still not right.

38:50.579 --> 38:56.165
A portion of the offspring
can't get clear of Moya's
external vent.

38:56.251 --> 38:59.038
I'm getting a closer visual now.

38:59.713 --> 39:01.453
What is that?

39:01.548 --> 39:03.129
What? What's wrong?

39:03.217 --> 39:06.300
The offspring, look.

39:10.140 --> 39:11.846
Chiana:
That's Moya's child?

39:11.934 --> 39:13.049
Yes.

39:13.143 --> 39:15.930
But it's covered in weapons.

39:31.370 --> 39:35.488
When D'Argo broke the
contraception wall
half a cycle ago,

39:35.582 --> 39:38.699
the Peacekeeper catalyst he
released must have contained

39:38.794 --> 39:41.911
a DNA signature to
produce weapons.

39:42.005 --> 39:43.120
Will that grow as big
as its mother?

39:43.215 --> 39:44.705
Possibly bigger.

39:44.800 --> 39:47.792
Will Moya control him
or the Peacekeepers?

39:47.886 --> 39:49.217
I don't know.

39:49.304 --> 39:52.137
There's never been a Leviathan
with weapons before,

39:52.224 --> 39:55.591
but we have a more immediate
problem. Look.

39:55.686 --> 39:59.178
The birthing channel was not
designed for this manner
of offspring.

39:59.273 --> 40:01.184
It cannot fly free.

40:01.275 --> 40:03.266
It is panicking and starting to
charge its way forward.

40:03.360 --> 40:06.318
Well, is he going to shoot
his way out of Moya?

40:06.405 --> 40:07.736
I think so.

40:07.823 --> 40:10.314
Pilot, can you force an
atmosphere I can breathe
into that vent?

40:10.409 --> 40:12.741
Yes. Yes, I think so.

40:12.828 --> 40:16.036
Maybe... maybe I can climb down
the internal shaft and
cut a seam,

40:16.123 --> 40:17.659
so the child can get
itself free.

40:17.749 --> 40:19.364
You'd better hurry.

40:24.673 --> 40:26.413
D'Argo:
It's good to see you again.

40:26.508 --> 40:27.964
Zhaan:
Come on.
They're not far behind.

40:28.051 --> 40:30.588
The Transport Pod is this way.
Let's go.

40:32.139 --> 40:33.879
Keep your weapons ready.

40:37.394 --> 40:39.225
Peacekeeper
Let's go!

40:42.733 --> 40:45.270
Heskon:
Eight and nine. Load weapons!

40:46.236 --> 40:48.147
D'Argo:
Aeryn, watch out!

40:51.908 --> 40:53.284
Zhaan:
Cover me, Aeryn!

41:00.876 --> 41:02.116
Go.

41:04.796 --> 41:06.661
(Crichton yelling )

41:22.856 --> 41:25.973
What was the secret you were
keeping hidden from Scorpius
down there?

41:26.068 --> 41:28.605
They thought it was about
his doomsday device.

41:28.695 --> 41:30.560
About wormholes. It wasn't.

41:30.656 --> 41:32.317
It was only about the time
I kissed a girl.

41:32.407 --> 41:33.237
Really?

41:33.325 --> 41:34.110
Yeah.

41:34.201 --> 41:36.863
(laughing)

41:43.001 --> 41:44.457
Okay, uh...

41:44.544 --> 41:46.125
Don't shoot me, baby Moya.

41:46.213 --> 41:48.955
Just, um... stay nice and calm.

41:50.258 --> 41:52.044
Nice and calm.

42:14.991 --> 42:17.368
The memory of a place I saw
when I was a boy.

42:17.452 --> 42:20.410
Must've been one hell
of a place.

42:29.339 --> 42:30.840
I can't do it, Pilot!

42:30.924 --> 42:33.131
You have to.

42:33.218 --> 42:35.174
It won't move!

42:36.847 --> 42:42.092
Moya's trying to control the
offspring but that weapon's
primed to fire.

42:46.273 --> 42:47.604
So let it fire.

42:47.691 --> 42:50.353
Tell Moya to let the gun fire
at low blast level.

42:50.444 --> 42:51.354
What?!

42:51.445 --> 42:53.686
I know it's crazy, but
it's the only way.

42:53.780 --> 42:56.772
If we don't get this child out,
it'll destroy Moya's bulkhead.

42:59.202 --> 43:00.658
Go, Zhaan!

43:05.208 --> 43:06.368
Crichton!

43:06.460 --> 43:07.825
We're coming!

43:12.048 --> 43:13.299
Come on.

43:13.383 --> 43:15.374
Let's give them something
to remember us by.

43:18.180 --> 43:20.421
(both laughing)

43:35.155 --> 43:37.111
( Peacekeepers screaming )

43:38.366 --> 43:39.981
Not yet!

43:40.076 --> 43:41.987
-Let me get out of here!
-I can't stop it!

43:42.078 --> 43:43.238
Get out now!

43:43.330 --> 43:44.740
Just get out!

43:47.417 --> 43:49.794
Run, Chiana, run!

43:49.878 --> 43:51.368
( screaming )

43:59.304 --> 44:01.044
That was a low-level blast?

44:01.139 --> 44:02.299
That did it.

44:02.390 --> 44:04.927
The offspring's free.

44:05.018 --> 44:06.258
It's free.

44:06.353 --> 44:07.468
How's Moya?

44:07.562 --> 44:08.517
She's okay.

44:08.605 --> 44:10.687
We're okay.

44:14.653 --> 44:16.268
Not quite.

44:17.739 --> 44:19.775
You're not going with them.

44:29.584 --> 44:31.290
(laughing)

44:31.378 --> 44:32.709
Shoot him, Gilina.

44:32.796 --> 44:34.081
Shoot him!

44:39.135 --> 44:40.215
(moaning)

44:40.303 --> 44:42.168
Gilina!

44:42.264 --> 44:43.470
We must get back to the
Transport Pod.

44:43.557 --> 44:45.263
The firewall is dissipating.

44:45.350 --> 44:47.215
(Gilina moans)

45:22.262 --> 45:24.503
Pilot:
Before she left the Gammak Base,

45:24.598 --> 45:27.681
Gilina scrambled the
scanning datafiles.

45:27.767 --> 45:31.009
Even Crais's Carrier
can't find us now,

45:31.104 --> 45:37.350
which is quite fortunate,
because we can't Starburst
with the offspring.

45:37.444 --> 45:39.810
We can't move very far at all.

45:39.905 --> 45:41.315
Thank you, Pilot.

45:41.406 --> 45:42.987
How's Gilina?

45:44.284 --> 45:46.400
Not good.

45:48.413 --> 45:50.199
What about Moya's child?

45:50.290 --> 45:51.655
He's okay.

45:51.750 --> 45:53.240
He?

45:53.335 --> 45:55.041
It's a boy?

45:55.128 --> 45:56.117
Yes.

45:56.212 --> 45:57.588
A male.

45:57.672 --> 45:59.287
Excellent.

45:59.382 --> 46:02.215
What kind of a beast is he?

46:15.440 --> 46:18.978
Just lie still, let Zhaan's
medicine do its work.

46:20.278 --> 46:22.189
You'll be fine in a
little while.

46:22.280 --> 46:23.861
( heavy breathing )

46:23.949 --> 46:26.565
No more lies, John.

46:27.243 --> 46:29.199
I'm not lying.

46:32.123 --> 46:34.159
Gilina, why did you come
back for us?

46:34.250 --> 46:36.502
I had to help you.

46:38.254 --> 46:41.587
Aeryn was right.

46:41.675 --> 46:46.294
If I'd stayed there they
would've found out about me.

46:50.433 --> 46:53.175
Found out that I...

46:53.269 --> 46:55.885
I love you.

46:56.439 --> 46:58.600
Gilina.

46:59.484 --> 47:00.314
(gasp of pain)

47:00.402 --> 47:02.188
Crichton:
Zhaan...

47:02.278 --> 47:04.360
Stark:
May I help?

47:12.455 --> 47:14.286
May I give you this?

47:16.209 --> 47:18.370
It's a place I once saw.

47:18.461 --> 47:21.578
I've been carrying it with me
for a very long time.

47:21.673 --> 47:24.005
(exhaling)

47:25.218 --> 47:28.051
Oh, it's beautiful.

47:29.055 --> 47:30.716
It's beautiful.

47:31.266 --> 47:33.348
There now.

47:34.561 --> 47:36.893
Just hold onto it.

47:36.980 --> 47:39.221
Don't let go.

47:53.329 --> 47:54.705
John.

47:55.206 --> 47:56.787
Yeah?

47:57.625 --> 47:59.286
Do you think...

47:59.377 --> 48:02.335
if things had been different...

48:04.257 --> 48:07.090
that you could've loved me?

48:08.970 --> 48:10.881
Yeah.
