that you have told her
and me has been a lie.

40:10.676 --> 40:15.647
And this phony baloney company
you say you work for,
that doesn't exist.

40:15.681 --> 40:18.917
Now, who are you?

40:18.950 --> 40:22.220
Are you gonna tell me,
or are you gonna leave me
to make up my own mind?

40:22.253 --> 40:23.855
"Fortune hunter."

40:23.889 --> 40:27.025
I love that little girl more
than I love my own life.

40:28.426 --> 40:32.230
And there's nothin'
that I would not do...

40:32.263 --> 40:36.067
to protect her.

40:36.101 --> 40:39.104
I would kill to protect her.

40:39.137 --> 40:41.640
Do you believe me?

40:44.142 --> 40:47.145
[ Sighs ]
Sir, I would like
to talk to Joss.

40:49.515 --> 40:51.583
Boy, I want to know
who you are.

40:51.617 --> 40:55.987
I'm not kiddin' around.
I know that you're not.

40:56.021 --> 40:58.924
You know, my whole life--
I need you to tell me
who you are!

41:01.827 --> 41:04.930
I'm exactly who I say I am.

41:08.299 --> 41:11.703
That leaves me two choices.

41:11.737 --> 41:14.472
One of them is to leave you
in the desert.

41:14.506 --> 41:16.642
I'm an honorable man.

41:16.675 --> 41:18.644
And I'm in love with Joss.

41:18.677 --> 41:21.379
And I want to marry her.

41:21.412 --> 41:23.749
Put him on the airplane.

41:26.852 --> 41:29.154
I'm gonna warn her
against you.

41:29.187 --> 41:33.825
And she will take my advice,
just as she always does.

41:33.859 --> 41:36.928
Just as she swore to her father
that she would.

41:36.962 --> 41:41.833
Any attempt by you to contact
her again would be pointless,

41:41.867 --> 41:44.670
as well as dangerous to you.

41:44.703 --> 41:46.738
Now get the hell out of here.

41:55.714 --> 41:59.585
Tell Miss Morgan I'm comin' up
to see her immediately.

42:05.490 --> 42:10.061
Miss Morgan, Mr. Carson's
on his way to see you now.

42:10.095 --> 42:12.764
Come on.
Let's go, buddy.

42:17.068 --> 42:20.438
[ Jonas ]
Buckboard
with package, unhurt.

42:20.471 --> 42:23.274
Wheels up
and outbound for home base.

42:23.308 --> 42:26.077
Roger.
Buckboard out.

42:26.111 --> 42:28.046
Anybody hit?

42:28.079 --> 42:31.783
- Hot time in the old town
tonight, Top.
- Oh, yeah.

42:31.817 --> 42:34.385
Anybody?
[ Bob ]
Yep.

42:34.419 --> 42:36.922
How's your boy?

42:36.955 --> 42:39.858
Well, he's got the shakes
and the shivers, don't he?

42:39.891 --> 42:42.493
Man. Anybody got
a cigarette?

42:42.527 --> 42:44.796
- You can't smoke here.
- [ Chuckles ]

42:46.998 --> 42:48.767
[ Sniffs ]

42:53.839 --> 42:55.674
He was going for a gun.

42:55.707 --> 42:57.676
Who's that?

42:57.709 --> 43:01.079
One of the men I killed.
The civilians?

43:01.112 --> 43:03.448
They were rebels.
He was going for a gun.

43:03.481 --> 43:05.516
- Was he?
- [ Stammers ]

43:05.550 --> 43:07.686
Are you sure?

43:09.921 --> 43:13.491
I killed two men.
I shot them.

43:13.524 --> 43:16.194
What do you want?
You want a medal?

43:23.769 --> 43:27.105
I killed two men.

43:27.138 --> 43:29.675
How did it feel?
