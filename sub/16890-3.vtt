Kimmy Schmidt, you are clearly
repressing some stuff,

for Titus!

00:54.639 --> 00:56.265
- You need to talk to somebody.
- Absolutely not.

00:56.348 --> 00:58.893

and you murder him in his sleep?

pin that on--

I'm not taking a lover.
That's gross.

01:06.484 --> 01:08.152
I can't even do
a dream date right.

01:08.235 --> 01:10.404

you're bottling up the past!

Kimmy Schmidt.

01:11.990 --> 01:13.324

One, it's titillating
like a horror movie.

01:34.303 --> 01:36.180
Two, it makes them
feel like a good person

01:36.263 --> 01:37.932
because they care
about a stranger.

01:38.016 --> 01:40.559
Three, it makes people feel safe
that it did not happen to them.

01:40.643 --> 01:43.103
- Ugh.
- This affects me too, you know!

so they know I can sing.

have the money to do this right.

- Nope.

08:42.147 --> 08:44.691
He's very available
and fabulously wealthy.

08:44.775 --> 08:46.860
He doesn't even work.
He could do lunch.

08:46.944 --> 08:50.322
Um, I'm not sure
I'm ready for a "date" date.

08:50.406 --> 08:52.366
Oh, true. You look like
you slept in those clothes.

08:52.450 --> 08:54.576
Well, go spruce up
and meet him at Bistro Madison.

08:54.659 --> 08:56.203
Just relax and be yourself.

08:56.287 --> 08:57.871
Also, I've seen you eat,
so don't.

08:57.955 --> 09:00.832
Oh, yay!

09:04.378 --> 09:07.381
[man speaking Korean]

09:10.259 --> 09:14.472
I didn't know you had
an elderly Korean friend.

09:14.554 --> 09:17.182
Speaking of which,
I think that Kim Jong Jr.

09:17.266 --> 09:18.934
is doing a bang-up job.

09:20.602 --> 09:21.937
What is that?

09:23.772 --> 09:26.484
I was asked to sing here...

09:26.566 --> 09:28.152
at the funeral...

09:28.235 --> 09:29.736
of my dear friend...

09:32.572 --> 09:34.450
Son Hae Sop.

09:35.200 --> 09:39.330
I hope you sing one of those
sad Boyz II Men songs.

09:39.413 --> 09:44.001
They always remind me
of all the homies I've lost.

09:44.084 --> 09:45.585
[mouthing words]

09:46.795 --> 09:49.047
Okay.
I'm going on a date.

09:49.131 --> 09:50.674
What kind of socks
do you wear on a date?

09:50.757 --> 09:52.676
Idiot! You're going
to a nice restaurant.

09:52.759 --> 09:54.178
They probably have
socks there.

09:54.594 --> 09:55.846
I don't know how to do this.

09:55.929 --> 09:57.597
I've never put on makeup
in my life.

09:57.931 --> 10:00.976
I don't think this is for me.

10:05.814 --> 10:07.191
Ow. Ow!

10:07.274 --> 10:09.026
Dang this fancy comb!

10:09.109 --> 10:12.530
[sultry voice]
I think I'm gonna have the...

10:12.612 --> 10:13.655
steak.

10:15.032 --> 10:16.408
All I wanted was
someone to talk to.

10:16.492 --> 10:18.452
Now I'm meeting some boy
at a restaurant.

10:18.536 --> 10:19.703
This is so wack!

10:19.786 --> 10:22.622
In the bunker, I was perfectly
happy just talking to myself,

10:22.706 --> 10:24.041
like this.

10:27.336 --> 10:28.462
I saw that in a movie once.

10:28.546 --> 10:31.298
I know. I was with you.
Oh, right.

10:35.219 --> 10:37.555
Um, Grant Belden?

10:37.637 --> 10:38.722
No.

10:38.805 --> 10:40.391
Oh, good. I--

10:40.474 --> 10:44.311
You're not Grant Belden.
I'm Grant Belden.

12:10.981 --> 12:13.317
Good dog.

Mr. Belden, I don't know
if I should tell you this,

12:15.777 --> 12:17.195
but there's no dog.

12:17.279 --> 12:19.448
I don't know
if I should tell you this,

12:19.531 --> 12:23.619
but I slept
with my twin brother's wife.

12:23.702 --> 12:26.955
I told her I was him.
[laughs]

12:27.038 --> 12:30.584
She had no idea.
Shh, shh, shh.

12:30.668 --> 12:32.043
So how's your ice cream?

12:32.127 --> 12:35.297
Cold!
Oh, so cold.

12:35.380 --> 12:38.008
The Krauts had us
surrounded in Bastogne.

12:38.091 --> 12:40.218
We nearly froze to death.

12:40.302 --> 12:42.971
But we kept each other warm...

12:43.054 --> 12:45.056
any way we could.

12:45.140 --> 12:48.977
When I was eight,
I stole $5

12:49.060 --> 12:50.729
from my mother's purse.

12:50.812 --> 12:53.607
Yes, well, Mother
could be strict.

12:53.691 --> 12:56.276
But she always kept
a pocket full of chocolate syrup

12:56.360 --> 12:58.737
for the wee ones.

12:58.820 --> 13:00.780
I can tell you anything,
can't I?

13:00.864 --> 13:02.949
I can talk to you,
and you won't think I'm a freak,

13:03.033 --> 13:05.327
like Titus
or that jerk Siri.

13:05.410 --> 13:07.912
You won't even remember!

13:07.996 --> 13:09.373
Hot dog.

13:09.456 --> 13:12.042
I'm a Mole Woman.

13:12.125 --> 13:14.378
When we got to Dusseldorf,
they made us shoot

13:14.461 --> 13:16.796
all the zoo animals.

13:16.880 --> 13:19.132
I was kept underground
for 15 years

13:19.216 --> 13:20.676
by an insane preacher.

13:20.759 --> 13:23.303
I ate giraffe,
and I liked it.

Jackie Lynn.

13:37.359 --> 13:39.486
I told you,
it's Jacqueline now.

13:39.570 --> 13:42.113
Jackie Lynn
is a cheap stripper name.

13:42.197 --> 13:43.741
Jacqueline
is a classy stripper name.

13:43.823 --> 13:45.283
Ehh.

13:45.367 --> 13:48.078
Your father was elected
chair of Tribal Council.

13:48.161 --> 13:50.539
You really should come back
to this year's Sun Dance.

13:50.622 --> 13:52.499
Sundance?
The film festival?

13:52.583 --> 13:55.043
I hear Kevin Smith has really
outdone himself this time.

13:55.126 --> 13:56.670
He's a hack.

13:56.754 --> 13:59.256
And we're talking
about the Lakota Sun Dance.

13:59.339 --> 14:00.549
Jeez, Jackie Lynn,

14:00.632 --> 14:02.133
where is the
morning star necklace

14:02.217 --> 14:03.385
that your grandmother made?

14:03.468 --> 14:04.553
I sold it.

14:04.636 --> 14:07.347
I sold all my old trinkets
so that I could own Manhattan,

14:07.431 --> 14:08.682
and it's working.

14:08.766 --> 14:09.808
I'm a stewardess.

14:09.891 --> 14:11.309
I'm dating a rich, older man,

14:11.393 --> 14:13.353
and I'm lying to him
about my birth control.

14:13.437 --> 14:15.105
Ay.

14:15.188 --> 14:16.898
Aren't you happy for me?

14:16.981 --> 14:19.234
I'm actually succeeding here.

14:19.317 --> 14:21.194
And someday I'll have
enough money

14:21.278 --> 14:23.614
so you guys can come
to New York and live with me.

14:23.697 --> 14:25.532
We don't want to live
in New York.

14:25.616 --> 14:27.367
The littering here
makes me cry.

14:27.451 --> 14:29.119
I don't know you anymore.

14:29.202 --> 14:31.079
Jac-que-line.

14:31.162 --> 14:32.914
[speaking Lakota]
We're all related.

14:32.997 --> 14:34.499
[Fern] That means you're supposed
to think of other people,

14:34.583 --> 14:36.543
and you only care
about yourself.

14:36.627 --> 14:38.587
You've forgotten
everything we taught you.

14:38.670 --> 14:40.631
Yeah, well, some of the things
you taught me were dumb,

14:40.714 --> 14:42.466
like using the whole buffalo.

14:42.549 --> 14:44.802
Some parts
just aren't good, guys,

14:44.884 --> 14:46.637
for example, the poop.

14:46.720 --> 14:48.764
No one told you
to use the poop.

14:48.847 --> 14:50.056
Oh.

14:50.140 --> 14:51.725
We wanted you
to come back with us.

14:51.809 --> 14:54.853
That's why we came all this way
in the great iron eagle.

14:54.936 --> 14:56.271
I'm kidding.

14:56.354 --> 14:58.732
I know what planes are.
I was in the Air Force.

14:58.816 --> 15:00.108
But...

15:00.191 --> 15:01.860
this feels like goodbye.

15:03.612 --> 15:05.614
Fine.

15:05.697 --> 15:07.991
If that's how you feel...

15:12.579 --> 15:13.622
Goodbye.

15:14.914 --> 15:16.708
Sorry.
Grant and I just kept talking,

15:16.792 --> 15:18.293
and I don't have a watch,

15:18.376 --> 15:21.546
and then I realized
my phone has a clock on it.

15:21.630 --> 15:23.214
Where is Cupertino?

15:23.298 --> 15:24.549
So you two hit it off?

15:24.633 --> 15:26.551
We're actually having
dinner tonight.

15:26.635 --> 15:29.596
Well, not tonight, 3:00 pm.

15:29.680 --> 15:31.222
I knew it!

15:31.306 --> 15:33.642
You know, at first,
I was afraid, "Is he too old?

15:33.725 --> 15:34.976
Is it weird that all
of his wives

15:35.059 --> 15:36.728
have been killed
in boating accidents?"

15:36.812 --> 15:38.313
But then I thought,

15:38.396 --> 15:40.231
"He has a floor-through
apartment at 1134 Fifth Avenue.

15:40.315 --> 15:42.901
You, sir, can kill me
on a boat anytime."

15:44.068 --> 15:46.488
Oh, Charles, you're gonna have
to take Buckley

15:46.571 --> 15:47.614
to lacrosse today.

15:47.698 --> 15:48.824
Why?

15:48.907 --> 15:50.826
Because Kimmy
has a second date.

15:50.909 --> 15:51.993
Yay.

15:53.912 --> 15:55.288
Sorry about that.

15:55.372 --> 15:56.832
Well, I guess we're not
all cute enough

15:56.915 --> 15:58.041
to get set up by Jacqueline.

15:58.124 --> 15:59.167
Who is?
What?

15:59.250 --> 16:00.335
Me is? Shut up.
Hello?

16:00.418 --> 16:01.712
Hello, hello?

16:01.795 --> 16:03.046
[chuckles]

16:05.590 --> 16:07.300
Why are you so weird?

16:07.384 --> 16:08.968
Why am I rubber
and you're glue?

16:09.052 --> 16:12.723
You're going on another date
with Grant Belden?

16:12.806 --> 16:14.140
That dude's, like, older
than rocks,

16:14.224 --> 16:15.893
and he fought in some war
with Germany,

16:15.975 --> 16:17.394
the guys from soccer.

16:17.477 --> 16:19.354
Why would you ever
go out with him?

16:19.437 --> 16:21.648
Why do you care?

16:21.732 --> 16:22.858
Step off, Xan.

16:22.941 --> 16:25.109
"Step off"?

16:25.193 --> 16:28.196
Every time you open your mouth,
I get one step closer

16:28.279 --> 16:30.615
to figuring out
what your deal is.

16:30.699 --> 16:34.786
And then this is all over.

16:37.372 --> 16:39.708
Sometimes the Reverend
would tie our hair together.

16:39.791 --> 16:41.459
He called it a "braidipede."

16:41.543 --> 16:45.672
Once, I surrendered to what
turned out to be a statue.

16:45.756 --> 16:47.799
Do you think going through
something like that--

16:47.883 --> 16:51.094
a war or whatever--
makes you a better person?

16:51.177 --> 16:54.138
Or deep down, does it just
make you bitter and angry?

16:54.222 --> 16:57.517
No!
Rexy, put it down!

16:57.601 --> 16:59.060
Drop it!

17:00.520 --> 17:03.106
I choked my roommate
in my sleep this morning.

17:03.189 --> 17:04.816
And I didn't tell him this,
but the other day,

17:04.900 --> 17:07.068
I woke up in the shower,
cleaning a knife.

17:07.151 --> 17:09.696
What had I done with it?

17:09.780 --> 17:12.198
Do I ever get
to be normal again?

17:12.282 --> 17:14.952
This soup is freezing!

17:15.034 --> 17:16.369
I don't think
this is working.

17:16.453 --> 17:18.538
What the living hell is this?

17:18.622 --> 17:20.415
It's not enough
just to say things out loud.

17:20.498 --> 17:22.333
I need someone
I can talk with.

17:22.417 --> 17:25.128
You may as well be that old
volleyball I drew a face on.

17:25.211 --> 17:27.380
Wilson, from Cast Away?

17:27.464 --> 17:29.173
More nonsense.

17:29.257 --> 17:31.050
Look, you're a very nice man,
but you're not gonna be

17:31.134 --> 17:32.803
the person I can talk to
about the bunker.

17:32.886 --> 17:35.138
The bunker?
[gasps]

17:35.221 --> 17:36.431
How do you know
about that?

17:36.514 --> 17:37.975
No. No, no.
Different bunker.

17:38.057 --> 17:41.269
I swore I'd take that secret
to my grave,

17:41.352 --> 17:42.896
and I did!

17:42.980 --> 17:46.190
But then I clawed my way out,
and I still kept it.

17:46.274 --> 17:47.525
Oh, who are you?

17:47.609 --> 17:50.236
Mr. Belden,
I'm Kimmy Schmidt.

17:50.320 --> 17:51.488
Schmidt!

17:51.571 --> 17:54.032
- You're a German spy.
- No.

17:54.115 --> 17:56.827
I know a Kraut
posing as a French prostitute

17:56.910 --> 17:58.161
when I see one.

17:58.244 --> 18:00.956
"Prostitute"?
"French"?

18:01.039 --> 18:02.415
I'm an American.

18:02.499 --> 18:04.375
Oh, all right, American.

18:04.459 --> 18:08.379
What was the batting order
of the 1938 Yankees?

18:08.463 --> 18:10.131
Oh, who would know that?

18:10.214 --> 18:12.592
Not you, you hooker!
Aah!

18:12.676 --> 18:15.136
Wha-- Oh!
God!

18:15.219 --> 18:17.848
[Grant]
Batting fourth, Joe DiMaggio,

18:17.931 --> 18:20.266

Lou Gehrig,

18:20.350 --> 18:22.226
Bill Dickey, Joe Gordon.

18:22.310 --> 18:24.437
Mm, Mrs. Voorhees?
Hi.

18:24.521 --> 18:26.356
Thank you.
I am.

18:26.439 --> 18:29.359
Just getting a run in 'cause
I only worked out twice today.

18:29.442 --> 18:31.028
Wait.
Where's Grant?

18:31.110 --> 18:33.321
Don't talk to her,
Mrs. Roosevelt!

18:33.404 --> 18:34.447
She's a spy!

18:34.531 --> 18:35.657
He thinks he's in the war.

18:35.740 --> 18:37.868
I'm trying to lure him
back home, so he'll be safe.

18:37.951 --> 18:39.494
I though this might happen.

18:39.577 --> 18:41.120
At the Met Ball last year,

18:41.204 --> 18:43.247
he punched Blake Lively
because she said "gesundheit."

18:43.331 --> 18:44.916
Grenade!

18:45.000 --> 18:46.626
- Maybe I can help.
- Ow.

18:46.710 --> 18:50.088
I did pick up some German
during my stewardess days.

18:50.171 --> 18:53.216
[speaking German]
A beverage, sir? Or a hot towel?

18:53.299 --> 18:56.053
Our movie tonight
is Daddy Daycare!

18:56.386 --> 18:59.430
Well, that's not
Eleanor Roosevelt.

18:59.514 --> 19:02.809
It's a spy
with the same sweet caboose.

19:02.893 --> 19:03.935
Aah!

19:05.812 --> 19:07.271
That was humiliating!

19:07.355 --> 19:08.565
And I wish I knew
what "heu-geen-babo" means.

19:08.648 --> 19:09.524
Black idiot.

19:09.607 --> 19:11.526
Man, you really don't want
to pay me, do you?

19:11.609 --> 19:13.028
Lillian, I told you,
I'm broke!

19:13.111 --> 19:15.864
Liar.
I saw you yesterday.

19:15.947 --> 19:19.117
I was doing my exercises,
and as you know,

19:19.200 --> 19:22.161
my floor suffered
some water damage.

19:22.245 --> 19:24.247
Son of a--
[gasps]

19:24.330 --> 19:26.332
[laughing]

19:28.626 --> 19:30.503
Gay Judas!
[gasps]

19:30.587 --> 19:32.213
[both]
I can't believe you!

19:32.296 --> 19:34.591
Here, take it.
It doesn't matter anyway.

19:34.674 --> 19:35.800
Thanks to your shenanigans,

19:35.884 --> 19:38.386
I missed
my head shot appointment.

19:38.469 --> 19:39.763
Wait.

19:39.846 --> 19:41.806
Head shots?
Really?

19:41.890 --> 19:43.808
I figured the money
was for something weird,

19:43.892 --> 19:45.268
like Barbie shoes.

19:45.351 --> 19:47.104
Barbie shoes
aren't weird, Lillian!

19:47.186 --> 19:49.313
Hoarding newspapers
is weird.

19:49.397 --> 19:54.111
Wrong. Buying end tables is
weird when you got newspapers.

19:54.193 --> 19:55.653
Eh, here, take the money.

19:55.737 --> 19:57.822
What? Why?
Oh, God, are you dying?

19:57.906 --> 19:59.699
I knew it.
You look horrible.

19:59.783 --> 20:01.034
Titus...

20:01.118 --> 20:03.453
you need to share your talent.

20:05.705 --> 20:07.749
Thank you, Lillian.

20:07.832 --> 20:09.584
You know what?

20:09.667 --> 20:12.253
When I win my Tony Award,
you'll be the first person I--

20:12.336 --> 20:13.379
[man]
Nice suit, money bags!

20:13.463 --> 20:15.381
Oh, no!
Oh!

20:16.466 --> 20:20.428
For that to happen on the day
that we buried Son Hae Sop.

20:20.511 --> 20:21.888
It's too bad
about Grant.

20:21.972 --> 20:25.058
Deep down, he really is
a wonderful apartment.

20:25.142 --> 20:26.768
Can you speed him up again?

20:27.351 --> 20:30.147
[speaking German]
The president has a tiny penis!

20:30.229 --> 20:31.689
That's a lie!

20:31.773 --> 20:33.232
Oh.

20:33.524 --> 20:35.276
It's so big,
he's in a wheelchair.

20:35.359 --> 20:38.237
Kimmy, I apologize for this.

20:38.321 --> 20:39.697
It's okay.

20:39.781 --> 20:40.949
It was probably dumb of me

20:41.032 --> 20:42.450
to think that anyone
in New York City

20:42.533 --> 20:44.077
would get
what I've been through.

20:44.161 --> 20:45.829
You know, Ohio.

20:45.912 --> 20:48.289
Being single in New York
is sheer torture.

20:48.372 --> 20:50.374
Torture?
I'll talk!

20:50.458 --> 20:52.877
The invasion is planned
for Normandy.

20:52.961 --> 20:54.879
[doorman]
Sir? Mr. Belden, this way.

20:54.963 --> 20:57.757
Oh, I went outside today.
[chuckles]

21:02.137 --> 21:03.805
Jacqueline, we have a problem.

21:03.888 --> 21:05.890
How far along are you?
We'll say Kimmy's the mom.

21:05.974 --> 21:07.433
I'm not pregnant.

21:07.517 --> 21:09.477
This woman has the keys
to our house,

21:09.560 --> 21:11.188
and we don't even know
who she is.

21:11.270 --> 21:14.107
Kimmy Smith
from Middletown, Ohio,

21:14.191 --> 21:15.399
I've been Googling you.

21:15.483 --> 21:17.027
You have?
I didn't feel it.

21:17.110 --> 21:20.155
God, everything you say
is insane.

21:20.238 --> 21:22.115
I can't find anything out
about you online.

21:22.199 --> 21:23.449
Anything.

21:23.533 --> 21:25.910
Is Kimmy Smith
even your real name?

21:25.994 --> 21:28.287
Xanthippe Lannister Voorhees,

21:28.371 --> 21:30.331
how about you mind
your own damn business?

21:30.414 --> 21:32.333
Women have secrets, okay?

21:32.416 --> 21:34.377
Who knows what Kimmy
had to do to get here.

21:34.460 --> 21:35.795
Maybe she was a hooker.

21:35.879 --> 21:38.715
Okay, is this
how prostitutes dress nowadays?

21:38.798 --> 21:40.299
Admit that that
was a weird thing to say.

21:40.383 --> 21:42.635
No.
Her past doesn't matter.

21:42.719 --> 21:44.554
People come to New York
and start new lives,

21:44.637 --> 21:46.181
and it gets complicated.

21:46.264 --> 21:48.016
And you, of all people,
don't get to judge her.

21:48.099 --> 21:49.809
Your greatest accomplishment
in life

21:49.893 --> 21:51.936
is pulling off that lipstick,
which you have to let me borrow.

21:52.020 --> 21:53.104
It looks awesome.

21:53.188 --> 21:57.067
Now, take your spoiled ass
upstairs and go to your rooms.

21:57.150 --> 21:59.152
This is bullying,
you know.

21:59.236 --> 22:01.196
I'm being bullied,
and I'm not even fat!

22:05.658 --> 22:08.369
White people...
am I right?

22:14.167 --> 22:15.752
- Hey.
- Hey.

22:15.835 --> 22:17.587
Sorry you had
to cover for me.

22:17.670 --> 22:19.338
It was not worth it.

22:19.422 --> 22:21.424
My date tried to kill me
with a pine cone.

22:21.507 --> 22:22.800
Yeah.

22:22.884 --> 22:24.302
Yeah, sure.
We've all been there.

22:24.385 --> 22:26.763
- Oh.
- [chuckles]

22:26.846 --> 22:29.266
Uh, Buckley's lacrosse
was actually fun.

22:29.348 --> 22:31.101
He kept getting nailed
by the ball.

22:31.184 --> 22:32.435
And I know it's wrong,

22:32.518 --> 22:35.521
but, oh, man,
it was so satisfying.

22:35.605 --> 22:36.773
So...

22:36.856 --> 22:38.316
um...

22:38.399 --> 22:40.443
maybe tomorrow
I'll go with you,

22:40.526 --> 22:42.403
you know,
just keep you company.

22:42.486 --> 22:44.197
Okay. Sure.

22:45.782 --> 22:48.243
Later, gator.

22:57.585 --> 23:00.171
[speaking Lakota]
I love you.

23:01.047 --> 23:02.215
Buddy.

23:03.674 --> 23:05.384
[clears throat]

24:07.155 --> 24:08.198
Good night, everybody!
