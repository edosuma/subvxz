WEBVTT

00:03.969 --> 00:07.064
Somewhere in that totality
known as the universe

00:07.173 --> 00:10.438
is a galaxy
called the Milky Way.

00:10.510 --> 00:13.377
Tucked into the corner
of that galaxy

00:13.446 --> 00:15.437
is a planet named Earth.

00:15.515 --> 00:19.952
On that planet
is a city called Mantua.

00:20.020 --> 00:22.488
Go straight ahead
past the fountain,

00:22.555 --> 00:25.456
turn right, then left,
then right again.

00:25.525 --> 00:28.961
You'll find yourself
walking along the water,

00:29.095 --> 00:33.122
listening as a man sings

00:33.199 --> 00:36.600
of his beloved's
unfaithful heart.

00:36.703 --> 00:40.002
And even the fish begin to weep.

00:40.073 --> 00:45.010
''Quando la donna é mobile. ''

00:45.078 --> 00:47.672
La donna é mobile

00:47.747 --> 00:50.113
Qual piuma al vento

00:50.183 --> 00:53.118
Muta d'accento

00:53.186 --> 00:55.177
E di pensiero

00:55.255 --> 00:57.348
Sempre un'amabile

00:57.424 --> 01:00.018
Leggiadro viso

01:00.060 --> 01:02.620
ln pianto, o in riso

01:02.662 --> 01:05.062
E' menzognero

01:05.131 --> 01:07.565
La donna é mobile

01:07.634 --> 01:09.659
Qual piuma al vento

01:09.769 --> 01:12.932
Muta d'accento

01:15.241 --> 01:17.209
E di pensier

01:20.346 --> 01:23.281
E di pensier...

01:23.349 --> 01:25.146
Tuvok.

01:25.218 --> 01:29.177
E di pensier.

01:33.726 --> 01:35.318
Tuvok.

01:37.363 --> 01:38.295
Janeway to Security.

01:38.364 --> 01:39.797
Get a team to the Mess Hall
right away.

01:39.866 --> 01:40.628
Stand back.

01:40.700 --> 01:41.792
He's been seized

01:41.901 --> 01:42.993
by the Pon farr.

01:44.304 --> 01:46.465
A neurochemical imbalance
is driving him to mate.

01:46.573 --> 01:49.337
We won't be able
to reason with him.

01:49.409 --> 01:52.674
Tuvok, l understand

01:52.745 --> 01:54.679
You are a Vulcan man

01:54.747 --> 01:57.011
You have just gone without

01:57.117 --> 01:59.847
For seven years about

01:59.919 --> 02:01.443
Paris, please find a way

02:01.521 --> 02:04.354
To load a hypospray

02:04.424 --> 02:07.052
l will give you the sign

02:07.127 --> 02:08.991
Just aim for his behind

02:09.062 --> 02:11.121
Hormones are raging

02:11.197 --> 02:13.791
Synapses blazing

02:13.867 --> 02:23.936
lt's all so ve...

02:24.043 --> 02:26.238

02:38.992 --> 02:41.722
- Bravo!
- Bravo!

02:45.064 --> 02:48.522
- Bravo!
- Bravo!

02:55.909 --> 02:57.604
Doctor?

02:58.645 --> 03:01.079
Doctor?

03:01.147 --> 03:02.409
Hello?

03:02.482 --> 03:03.540
Hmm.

03:04.651 --> 03:06.482
Maybe l'd better
run a diagnostic

03:06.553 --> 03:08.077
on your hearing subroutines.

03:08.154 --> 03:09.451
My hearing's fine.

03:09.522 --> 03:13.959
l was just letting
my mind wander, that's all.

03:15.000 --> 03:21.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:07.440 --> 05:08.964
lf you're not working
on anything, you should

05:09.075 --> 05:10.007
deactivate yourself.

05:10.076 --> 05:11.008
Save us the energy.

05:11.077 --> 05:12.044
Wait a second.

05:12.111 --> 05:14.511
l thought l was scheduled
to go on the away team.

05:14.580 --> 05:15.638
Well, the planet
looks pretty safe

05:15.715 --> 05:16.807
on the long- range sensors.

05:16.883 --> 05:18.748
Any medical problems, and
we can just use the transporter.

05:18.818 --> 05:19.842
But take a look at those scans,

05:19.919 --> 05:21.477
and see if there's anything
we might have missed.

05:21.554 --> 05:24.887
Lieutenant, l wanted
to go on the away team.

05:24.957 --> 05:26.515
There's a canyon on that planet

05:26.592 --> 05:27.820
l'd like to investigate.

05:27.894 --> 05:29.122
l've already
handed out assignments.

05:29.195 --> 05:30.890
Next time.

05:33.433 --> 05:37.130
lf you'd like, l'll snap
a few images for you.

05:37.236 --> 05:38.703
Don't bother.

05:38.771 --> 05:40.238
Suit yourself.

05:42.975 --> 05:45.443
l'll just use my imagination.

05:53.152 --> 05:54.449
Where did that come from?

05:54.520 --> 05:55.748
Good question.

05:55.822 --> 05:57.790
Didn't show up on sensors
until a few minutes ago.

06:00.126 --> 06:01.423
T- class nebula.

06:01.494 --> 06:04.054
1,000 kilometer diameter.

06:04.130 --> 06:05.654
Hydrogen, helium...

06:05.732 --> 06:06.721
argon.

06:06.799 --> 06:08.027
Nothing too dramatic.

06:08.134 --> 06:11.228
lf you want some drama,
take a look at this.

06:12.939 --> 06:15.237
''To Captain Kathryn Janeway,
Starship Voyager

06:15.308 --> 06:18.607
''from Emergency Medical
Hologram, Starship Voyager.

06:18.678 --> 06:22.876
''Topic: Status of Emergency
Medical Hologram

06:23.015 --> 06:24.346
Starship Voyager. ''

06:24.417 --> 06:25.816
He's filing a formal grievance.

06:25.885 --> 06:27.147
Regarding?

06:27.220 --> 06:28.710
His treatment by the crew.

06:28.788 --> 06:31.416
There's also a paragraph
about his future on Voyager

06:31.491 --> 06:34.551
and a proposal
for his advancement.

06:34.627 --> 06:37.061
''Failure
to acknowledge sentience.''

06:37.130 --> 06:38.427
''Rude behavior.''

06:38.498 --> 06:40.227
What's this?

06:40.299 --> 06:42.199
A request to be ''made Captain

06:42.301 --> 06:45.031
in the event
of a catastrophic emergency.''

06:45.138 --> 06:46.298
He's serious?

06:46.406 --> 06:47.668
Dead serious,

06:47.740 --> 06:49.264
and he wants
a formal response...

06:49.375 --> 06:50.307
for the record.

06:50.376 --> 06:52.640
Protocol allows
for Commander Chakotay

06:52.712 --> 06:54.680
or myself
to address his demands,

06:54.747 --> 06:56.112
if the Captain would prefer.

06:56.182 --> 06:57.581
No, l'll take care of it.

06:57.650 --> 06:59.174
l don't want anybody

06:59.252 --> 07:00.617
to be uncomfortable
on this ship.

07:00.686 --> 07:02.051
l guess we should
all try to be

07:02.121 --> 07:03.486
a little more considerate
of his feelings.

07:03.556 --> 07:05.421
Captain, he does it to himself.

07:05.491 --> 07:07.118
He's Chief Medical Officer.

07:07.193 --> 07:09.718
ls it our fault
that's not enough for him?

07:09.796 --> 07:11.423
Resume course toward the planet.

07:11.497 --> 07:13.124
Chakotay, you have the Bridge.

07:13.199 --> 07:15.463
l've got a formal response
to draft.

08:08.554 --> 08:11.648
What category did l
assign that vessel?

08:11.724 --> 08:13.589
Unacceptable risk.

08:13.659 --> 08:14.819
Correct.

08:14.961 --> 08:17.657
And what was my justification
for that decision?

08:17.730 --> 08:20.665
The ship appears
in none of our databases.

08:20.733 --> 08:23.930
lnitial attempts
to scan the interior failed.

08:24.036 --> 08:26.630
Then why are you
wasting our resources?

08:26.739 --> 08:29.503
l- l think l can
penetrate the hull...

08:29.575 --> 08:32.203
uh, using a microtunneling
sensor...

08:32.278 --> 08:34.905
And observe the interior
one molecule at a time?

08:36.482 --> 08:37.881
There are
other potential targets

08:38.017 --> 08:39.211
that must be surveyed.

08:39.284 --> 08:42.583
lf l could tap into
a data transfer conduit,

08:42.655 --> 08:46.216
l'd be able to reach
their main computer core.

08:46.292 --> 08:48.317
That would tell me
all we need to know

08:48.394 --> 08:50.624
about their tactical systems...
in theory.

08:50.696 --> 08:52.254
We could be detected.

08:52.331 --> 08:54.891
They may not like
being spied upon.

08:55.067 --> 08:56.694
l think l've been
very careful avoiding this.

08:56.802 --> 08:58.235
l'll take every precaution- - 
l promise!

08:58.304 --> 08:59.896
Unacceptable risk.

09:00.006 --> 09:06.206
l've already transmitted
my proposal to the Hierarchy.

09:06.245 --> 09:08.713
They should be
responding momentarily.

09:08.781 --> 09:09.805
Do you have something

09:09.949 --> 09:11.246
- you'd like to say?
- No.

09:13.586 --> 09:14.951
The Hierarchy cannot be bothered

09:15.021 --> 09:16.852
with every ill- conceived
notion that you...

09:24.363 --> 09:26.263
They've approved.

09:26.332 --> 09:28.095
l'd better get started.

09:33.873 --> 09:36.671
You're too confrontational.

09:36.742 --> 09:38.573
He'll report you.

09:38.644 --> 09:39.668
Humph.

09:43.583 --> 09:46.245
Acceptable risk.

09:49.555 --> 09:50.988
The layer of antonium

09:51.057 --> 09:52.888
runs right along
the edge of the canyon.

09:52.959 --> 09:55.257
My scans show
geological instability

09:55.328 --> 09:57.990
within 100 meters
of the target location.

09:58.064 --> 10:01.124
l could put the Flyer down
just outside of that.

10:01.200 --> 10:02.861
l don't know, Tom.

10:02.969 --> 10:04.994
That might be a little too far.

10:05.104 --> 10:06.571
What's the matter, Neelix?

10:06.672 --> 10:08.037
Afraid of a little exercise?

10:10.109 --> 10:12.577
Well, l think we could handle
a 100- meter stroll.

10:12.678 --> 10:14.942
l have to agree.

10:15.047 --> 10:16.947
Maybe getting there.

10:17.016 --> 10:19.951
lt's coming back
l'm worried about.

10:20.019 --> 10:22.214
We'll be loaded down with ore.

10:22.288 --> 10:24.620
lf the ground is unstable...

10:24.690 --> 10:27.523
l suggest limiting the team
members to 20 kilograms.

10:27.593 --> 10:28.617
Preliminary scans indicate

10:28.694 --> 10:30.685
the crust is dense enough
to support that weight.

10:30.763 --> 10:33.630
You might try carrying

10:33.699 --> 10:35.633
a transport enhancer
to the site.

10:35.735 --> 10:37.293
That's not a bad idea.

10:37.403 --> 10:39.462
We'll beam the ore back
to the Delta Flyer- -

10:39.572 --> 10:41.301
and we won't have
to carry anything.

10:41.374 --> 10:43.399
You know, this mission
is starting to look

10:43.509 --> 10:45.477
a little more dangerous
than we thought.

10:45.578 --> 10:47.102
Maybe we do need
the Doctor to come along.

10:47.179 --> 10:49.238
lf one of us fell
through the crust,

10:49.315 --> 10:51.374
there could be injuries.

10:51.450 --> 10:53.281
l require the Doctor's
assistance in Astrometrics.

10:53.352 --> 10:54.410
What for?

10:57.089 --> 10:58.681
That's none of your business.

10:58.758 --> 10:59.690
l think it is.

11:01.594 --> 11:02.856
What's wrong, Captain?

11:02.928 --> 11:04.088
lt's nothing, really.

11:04.163 --> 11:05.391
An old Academy injury.

11:05.464 --> 11:07.022
Flares up every now and then.

11:07.099 --> 11:08.896
l've learned to live with it,

11:09.001 --> 11:11.936
but maybe you should
stay here and have a look.

11:12.071 --> 11:13.800
Right...

11:15.908 --> 11:17.375
there.

11:22.748 --> 11:24.340
Get away from him!

11:24.417 --> 11:27.352
You... are dismissed.

11:33.492 --> 11:34.459
Doctor?

11:35.795 --> 11:37.092
Doctor?

11:37.163 --> 11:38.892
Yes... Captain.

11:38.964 --> 11:42.400
Let's talk about
these demands of yours.

11:45.404 --> 11:47.838
l've given you a great deal
of freedom on this ship.

11:47.907 --> 11:49.135
l'm not disputing that.

11:49.208 --> 11:50.971
But you're not
satisfied, either.

11:51.043 --> 11:52.476
l should be allowed

11:52.545 --> 11:54.809
to participate and advance
according to my abilities,

11:54.880 --> 11:56.643
like any other member
of this crew.

11:56.716 --> 11:58.411
You should also
know your limits.

11:58.484 --> 12:00.884
My program can be
expanded indefinitely.

12:00.953 --> 12:02.215
l don't have limits.

12:02.288 --> 12:03.380
Maybe.

12:03.456 --> 12:05.390
But we all have primary
responsibilities.

12:05.458 --> 12:06.516
Yours is Sick Bay.

12:06.592 --> 12:07.889
l'm a computer program.

12:07.960 --> 12:10.224
Multiple tasking
is second nature to me.

12:10.296 --> 12:11.888
This proposal of yours...

12:12.031 --> 12:13.430
to be made a... what?

12:13.499 --> 12:14.898
What did you call it?

12:15.000 --> 12:16.024
ECH- -

12:16.135 --> 12:18.103
Emergency Command Hologram.

12:18.170 --> 12:20.638
ln principle,
it's an interesting idea.

12:20.706 --> 12:23.334
A backup Captain
in case l'm incapacitated,

12:23.409 --> 12:25.843
and the command
structure breaks down.

12:25.911 --> 12:29.438
But expanding your program
would take months of work.

12:29.515 --> 12:32.245
The lives of the crew
may depend on it someday.

12:34.253 --> 12:36.153
l'm afraid
the answer is no, Doctor.

12:36.222 --> 12:37.951
However, as part
of my formal response,

12:38.090 --> 12:39.648
l have recommended
that Starfleet

12:39.725 --> 12:42.353
assign a team of engineers
to consider your proposal.

12:42.428 --> 12:44.487
When we get back
to the Alpha Quadrant,

12:44.563 --> 12:45.621
l'll pass it along.

12:48.934 --> 12:50.128
Thank you, Captain.

12:50.236 --> 12:52.295
Thank you, Doctor.

13:00.713 --> 13:03.841
Ladies and gentlemen,
l'd like to introduce

13:03.916 --> 13:06.214
the Emergency
Command Hologram.

13:06.285 --> 13:07.309
Hear, hear.

13:08.387 --> 13:09.615
Congratulations.

13:12.658 --> 13:16.025
l've tried to access
their internal sensors,

13:16.095 --> 13:19.292
but l couldn't get past
the security encryption.

13:19.365 --> 13:21.595
So l found something
even better- -

13:21.667 --> 13:23.635
a holographic crewman.

13:23.702 --> 13:26.830
l've tapped into his
cognitive subroutines.

13:26.939 --> 13:30.534
We can now monitor
everything he's experiencing.

13:30.609 --> 13:32.736
lt's like having
an agent on board.

13:32.812 --> 13:34.439
To the ECH.

13:34.513 --> 13:36.413
Captain,
this is such an honor,

13:36.482 --> 13:39.747
but if you don't mind my saying,
hardly a surprise.

13:49.328 --> 13:51.762
Allow me to introduce...
the Doctor.

13:51.831 --> 13:53.560
He's a computer program- -

13:53.632 --> 13:56.192
a sentient piece
of holographic technology- -

13:56.302 --> 13:58.395
and he is Voyager's
Medical Officer.

13:58.504 --> 13:59.562
''Voyager''?

13:59.672 --> 14:01.264
That's the name of the ship.

14:01.373 --> 14:03.000
l've only been
observing the Doctor

14:03.075 --> 14:04.099
for a matter of hours,

14:04.210 --> 14:06.110
and l've already learned
more about this vessel

14:06.178 --> 14:08.703
than l did in three days
of sensor sweeps.

14:08.781 --> 14:10.305
Elaborate.

14:10.382 --> 14:12.680
The reason Voyager is
not in our database

14:12.751 --> 14:16.084
is because they are not
from this quadrant.

14:16.155 --> 14:18.885
They're... lost...

14:18.958 --> 14:20.186
alone.

14:20.259 --> 14:21.191
No backup vessel?

14:21.260 --> 14:22.192
Uh- huh.

14:22.261 --> 14:23.558
No one to contact for help?

14:23.629 --> 14:24.891
Precisely.

14:24.964 --> 14:27.626
Another few hours of observation
and l will know all

14:27.700 --> 14:30.294
we need to know
about them- - defenses,

14:30.402 --> 14:33.132
weapons, crew complement- - 
everything.

14:33.239 --> 14:35.764
From monitoring one individual?

14:35.875 --> 14:36.807
Unlikely.

14:36.876 --> 14:37.808
Actually...

14:37.877 --> 14:39.310
it is very likely.

14:39.378 --> 14:44.406
The social structure on Voyager
is- is much different than ours.

14:44.483 --> 14:45.415
How so?

14:45.484 --> 14:48.282
This is my observation post.

14:48.354 --> 14:51.653
l have a single function,
but the Doctor...

14:51.724 --> 14:54.557
does much more
than just practice medicine.

14:54.627 --> 14:59.223
He has access
to the entire ship.

14:59.298 --> 15:02.825
And he seems to be
an expert on... everything.

15:03.002 --> 15:07.439
ln fact, the Captain
just gave him authorization

15:07.539 --> 15:10.337
to command the Bridge!

15:10.409 --> 15:14.345
lt was a very...
exciting moment.

15:14.413 --> 15:16.438
Why aren't you
monitoring him now?

15:17.516 --> 15:19.609
Well, the link drops out
intermittently,

15:19.685 --> 15:21.676
but it should be reestablished
in a few minutes.

15:25.958 --> 15:27.949
Maintain your surveillance.

15:31.330 --> 15:33.764
This'll take care
of any potential allergens

15:33.832 --> 15:35.356
in the planet's atmosphere.

15:35.434 --> 15:38.130
l'll monitor your medical
status from the Bridge,

15:38.237 --> 15:40.205
but l don't anticipate
any problems.

15:40.272 --> 15:41.432
Since l'm not going,

15:41.540 --> 15:44.134
l wonder if you'd mind
snapping a few holo- images

15:44.209 --> 15:45.938
for me
while you're down there.

15:46.011 --> 15:47.273
Gladly.

15:47.346 --> 15:50.110
Tell me something, Mr. Neelix.

15:50.182 --> 15:52.116
Do you... daydream?

15:52.184 --> 15:54.516
On Talaxia, we have a saying- -

15:54.586 --> 15:56.850
''The dream dreams the dreamer.''

15:56.922 --> 15:58.514
Care to translate?

15:58.590 --> 16:01.491
We like to think
that fantasies and daydreams

16:01.560 --> 16:05.291
come from someplace else- - 
another land.

16:05.364 --> 16:08.197
They slip into our minds
and whisper about things

16:08.300 --> 16:09.358
we never imagined.

16:09.468 --> 16:10.696
A strange notion.

16:10.803 --> 16:12.236
Do you daydream, Doctor?

16:12.304 --> 16:13.236
No, of course not.

16:13.305 --> 16:14.363
l'm a computer program.

16:14.473 --> 16:15.940
l prefer wide shots, Mr. Neelix.

16:16.041 --> 16:18.874
lf you're feeling creative,
throw in a little ultraviolet.

16:18.944 --> 16:21.208
Will do.

16:29.121 --> 16:30.281
Voyager to Delta Flyer.

16:30.356 --> 16:31.482
Report.

16:31.557 --> 16:33.047
We're approaching the canyon.

16:33.125 --> 16:34.057
Phew, what a view.

16:34.126 --> 16:35.286
l'm sure it is.

16:35.361 --> 16:38.228
Put us in a synchronous orbit
above their landing coordinates.

16:38.297 --> 16:39.559
Voyager, Mayday!

16:39.631 --> 16:40.598
What's wrong?

16:40.666 --> 16:41.792
We've been hit.

16:41.867 --> 16:43.095
l'm taking us down
into the canyon...

16:43.202 --> 16:44.635
Harry...

16:44.703 --> 16:46.364
l don't know
what happened to them.

16:46.472 --> 16:48.736
l am picking up a vessel,
Captain.

16:48.807 --> 16:49.774
lt's Borg.

16:49.842 --> 16:52.140
Red Alert.

16:52.211 --> 16:53.542
On screen.

16:53.612 --> 16:55.637
Battle stations.

17:02.221 --> 17:04.018
Captain...

17:04.089 --> 17:07.080
you must relieve me of duty
at once.

17:07.159 --> 17:10.026
An assimilation virus
has penetrated our defenses.

17:10.095 --> 17:11.585
We're becoming drones.

17:11.663 --> 17:13.221
Hard to Starboard.

17:13.298 --> 17:15.095
Reinforce the shields.

17:15.200 --> 17:16.064
lncoming fire!

17:21.040 --> 17:22.598
Doctor...

17:22.708 --> 17:27.304
Computer, activate the ECH.

17:27.378 --> 17:28.971
Acknowledged.

17:32.618 --> 17:35.086
Transferring all systems
to your command.

17:35.154 --> 17:36.781
You have the Bridge.

17:36.855 --> 17:37.787
lndeed.

17:37.856 --> 17:39.517
Shields to maximum.

17:39.591 --> 17:42.219
Photon torpedoes, full volley.

17:42.294 --> 17:43.420
Fire.

17:45.130 --> 17:46.392
Computer, report.

17:46.465 --> 17:49.400
Enemy shields are intact.

17:49.501 --> 17:50.729
We are the Borg.

17:50.836 --> 17:52.565
l know very well who you are.

17:52.671 --> 17:54.138
Stand down your weapons.

17:54.239 --> 17:56.230
State your designation.

17:56.341 --> 18:00.801
Emergency Command Hologram,
at your service.

18:00.879 --> 18:03.313
Designation unknown.

18:03.382 --> 18:05.043
Not for long.

18:05.117 --> 18:06.084
Doctor...

18:24.536 --> 18:28.131
Warning.
Primary shields are failing.

18:28.240 --> 18:31.266
This is the last time
l'm going to ask you.

18:31.376 --> 18:33.105
Stand down your weapons.

18:33.178 --> 18:35.373
Turn back while you still can.

18:35.447 --> 18:38.473
You will be assimilated.

18:38.550 --> 18:40.882
Over my dead program.

18:41.019 --> 18:45.479
Computer,
activate the photonic cannon.

18:45.557 --> 18:48.993
The photonic cannon is on line.

18:49.061 --> 18:50.289
Fire.

18:57.002 --> 18:59.937
Doctor, can you confirm?

19:03.275 --> 19:05.436
The readings, Doctor.

19:06.879 --> 19:08.210
Um, the, uh...

19:10.949 --> 19:12.041
Uh...

19:12.117 --> 19:14.813
readings, uh...
confirm, of course.

19:14.887 --> 19:17.082
Uh, the away team's
physiologies are

19:17.156 --> 19:19.056
within acceptable parameters.

19:19.124 --> 19:20.250
All life signs stable.

19:20.325 --> 19:22.623
You're okay to proceed, Tom.

19:22.694 --> 19:23.718
Understood.

19:23.795 --> 19:26.127
We'll contact you again
when we reach the site.

19:31.236 --> 19:33.636
Voyager will not
be an easy target.

19:33.705 --> 19:35.832
lt is armed
with something called

19:35.941 --> 19:37.499
''a photonic cannon.''

19:37.609 --> 19:40.237
l watched them destroy
a Borg sphere

19:40.312 --> 19:41.870
with a single volley.

19:41.947 --> 19:44.609
There are no reports
of Borg in this region.

19:44.683 --> 19:47.208
l saw it with my own eyes.

19:47.286 --> 19:48.878
Did you check for debris?

19:48.954 --> 19:50.421
The ship was annihilated.

19:50.489 --> 19:52.719
There was nothing left
for the sensors to pick up.

19:53.792 --> 19:54.850
Continue.

19:54.927 --> 19:56.519
Their Captain was disabled

19:56.595 --> 19:57.857
in the attack.

19:57.930 --> 19:59.898
The hologram is now in command.

19:59.965 --> 20:01.398
He's...

20:01.466 --> 20:03.991
an impressive individual- -

20:04.102 --> 20:07.799
a physician, an engineer...
a warrior- -

20:07.906 --> 20:11.273
and very attractive
to the females.

20:11.343 --> 20:12.640
We must

20:12.711 --> 20:16.306
at all cost try to avoid
a direct confrontation with him.

20:16.381 --> 20:19.680
l recommend
a type- 3 stealth assault.

20:30.028 --> 20:31.495
The Hierarchy approves.

20:31.563 --> 20:34.589
Prepare for a stealth assault
type- 3.

20:34.666 --> 20:35.758
Scan for Borg.

20:35.834 --> 20:37.995
We don't want
any last- minute surprises...

20:39.438 --> 20:42.032
or mistakes.

20:50.415 --> 20:51.347
Doctor...

20:51.416 --> 20:52.678
can l have a word with you?

20:52.751 --> 20:54.514
l know l let
my attention drift a little

20:54.586 --> 20:56.110
on the Bridge,
but l assure you...

20:56.188 --> 20:57.120
Are you kidding?

20:57.189 --> 20:58.213
That was incredible.

20:58.290 --> 21:00.053
l just wanted
to congratulate you.

21:00.125 --> 21:01.558
For what exactly?

21:01.627 --> 21:03.492
The Borg will have
to think twice

21:03.562 --> 21:05.393
about attacking Voyager again.

21:05.464 --> 21:06.453
Nice work.

21:06.531 --> 21:08.556
Computer, locate
Commander Chakotay.

21:08.634 --> 21:11.603
Commander Chakotay is
in his quarters.

21:11.670 --> 21:13.262
Something wrong?

21:18.410 --> 21:20.241
What were you trying to do?

21:20.312 --> 21:23.406
l've been experimenting
with introducing a new function

21:23.482 --> 21:25.916
into my program- - 
cognitive projections...

21:25.984 --> 21:26.916
daydreaming.

21:26.985 --> 21:28.885
l wanted to be
able to daydream.

21:28.954 --> 21:30.478
An inefficient activity.

21:30.555 --> 21:31.817
We all do it
now and then, Seven.

21:31.890 --> 21:33.357
Why not the Doctor?

21:33.425 --> 21:34.756
My thought exactly.

21:34.826 --> 21:36.555
So, what's the problem?

21:37.629 --> 21:39.290
The algorithms
are malfunctioning.

21:39.364 --> 21:41.559
l'm starting to daydream...

21:41.633 --> 21:43.658
whether l want to or not.

21:43.769 --> 21:46.670
They say a Doctor
who operates on himself

21:46.738 --> 21:48.569
has a pahtk for a patient.

21:50.342 --> 21:51.309
l can help him.

21:51.410 --> 21:52.638
l'm sure you can.

21:52.711 --> 21:55.407
The Doctor and l are going
to Sick Bay.

21:55.480 --> 21:58.643
Any excuse to be alone
with him, eh, Seven?

21:58.717 --> 22:00.844
Assimilation is
an unpleasant fate.

22:00.919 --> 22:02.386
ls that a threat?

22:07.626 --> 22:08.786
This is impossible.

22:08.860 --> 22:12.523
The warp containment field
is failing!

22:14.333 --> 22:16.801
Warp core breach in 30 seconds.

22:16.902 --> 22:19.063
Try stabilizing
the antimatter flow.

22:19.171 --> 22:20.729
The control linkage is down.

22:20.839 --> 22:24.366
Warning. Warp core breach
a lot sooner than you think.

22:24.476 --> 22:27.377
We've got to get someone
inside the warp core...

22:27.446 --> 22:28.777
try to eject it manually.

22:28.847 --> 22:30.280
No one could survive

22:30.349 --> 22:32.613
the current level
of plasma radiation.

22:32.684 --> 22:34.743
- The Doctor.
- The Doctor.

22:34.820 --> 22:36.754
This isn't real...

22:36.822 --> 22:37.948
is it?

22:38.056 --> 22:40.251
Doc, you're the only one
who can help us.

22:40.325 --> 22:43.488
Warning. Last chance
to be a hero, Doctor.

22:43.562 --> 22:45.462
Get going.

22:45.530 --> 22:46.792
Here's the problem.

22:46.865 --> 22:49.231
The new algorithms
weren't isolated properly.

22:49.334 --> 22:51.802
They've branched
into his perceptual subroutines.

22:51.870 --> 22:53.895
Doc, why don't we take
a closer look

22:54.005 --> 22:55.302
at the matrix and...

22:55.374 --> 22:56.671
What are you doing?

22:56.742 --> 22:58.209
l have to eject the core.

22:58.276 --> 22:59.243
What?!

22:59.344 --> 23:00.868
- Deactivate his program.
- No, it will

23:00.979 --> 23:01.911
damage his matrix.

23:01.947 --> 23:03.244
Don't try to stop me.

23:03.315 --> 23:04.805
Let's take him to Sick Bay.

23:04.883 --> 23:06.544
l have to... l have
to save the ship!

23:06.618 --> 23:07.642
l have to save the ship!

23:08.720 --> 23:11.086
l have to save the ship!

23:14.126 --> 23:16.219
You look lovely tonight, Seven.

23:16.294 --> 23:17.454
Where shall we go?

23:17.529 --> 23:18.894
That sounds wonderful.

23:18.964 --> 23:19.896
The new algorithms

23:19.965 --> 23:22.058
have completely taken over
his program.

23:22.167 --> 23:23.065
Ambassador!

23:23.168 --> 23:25.102
So, now he's daydreaming
constantly?

23:25.170 --> 23:26.501
lt's a photonic cannon.

23:26.571 --> 23:27.936
l designed it myself.

23:28.006 --> 23:30.941
He seems to be randomly jumping
from one to the next.

23:31.009 --> 23:31.941
Oh. Pardon me, Miss.

23:32.010 --> 23:33.807
l routed his subroutines
to Holodeck 1,

23:33.879 --> 23:36.040
so Harry and Seven
could monitor his fantasies.

23:36.114 --> 23:37.843
Do you think
that's appropriate?

23:37.916 --> 23:40.180
They're his fantasies,
and l promised him

23:40.252 --> 23:42.345
we'd show a little
more consideration.

23:42.421 --> 23:44.446
lt'll give us a better idea
of what's going on,

23:44.523 --> 23:45.455
help us fix him.

23:45.524 --> 23:46.855
Mr. Neelix, how thoughtful.

23:46.925 --> 23:49.519
You baked me a cake...

23:49.594 --> 23:50.856
Kim to Sick Bay.

23:50.929 --> 23:52.123
Go ahead, Harry.

23:52.197 --> 23:54.722
You might want
to have a look at this.

23:54.800 --> 23:56.199
We're on our way.

23:58.003 --> 23:59.231
Mm- hmm.

24:20.625 --> 24:22.616
Keep still, please.

24:22.694 --> 24:24.889
Anything you say, Doctor.

24:24.963 --> 24:27.397
He does the hands very well.

24:27.466 --> 24:30.560
Apparently, he's had
a great deal of practice.

24:30.669 --> 24:31.636
Look at these.

24:44.683 --> 24:45.672
Computer...

24:45.750 --> 24:51.086
activate
the Emergency Command Hologram.

24:51.156 --> 24:53.852
This is the part l like.

24:56.328 --> 24:58.387
Nice touch.

24:58.463 --> 25:00.294
Bring the photonic cannon
on line.

25:00.365 --> 25:01.491
Photonic cannon?

25:01.566 --> 25:03.193
A weapon of mass destruction,

25:03.301 --> 25:05.326
invented by the Doctor,
of course.

25:05.437 --> 25:06.495
Of course.

25:06.605 --> 25:07.731
ln many of his fantasies,
he takes

25:07.839 --> 25:09.329
command and saves the ship.

25:09.441 --> 25:10.874
l see.

25:10.942 --> 25:12.409
Which means
that particular algorithm

25:12.477 --> 25:14.274
is more easily accessible
than the others.

25:14.346 --> 25:15.472
So, if we can isolate it,

25:15.547 --> 25:17.879
we might be able to
stabilize his program.

25:17.983 --> 25:20.213
Why do you torment
me like this?

25:20.285 --> 25:21.877
That was never my intention.

25:22.020 --> 25:23.385
lt wasn't?

25:23.455 --> 25:25.013
l want you to be happy,
B'Elanna.

25:25.090 --> 25:26.057
Without you?

25:26.124 --> 25:27.056
What?!

25:27.125 --> 25:28.114
Shh...

25:28.193 --> 25:31.253
l'll always be...
fond of you.

25:31.329 --> 25:32.694
That will never change.

25:32.764 --> 25:34.356
You can't just leave me.

25:34.432 --> 25:37.128
l couldn't bear to be alone.

25:37.235 --> 25:39.066
Aren't you forgetting someone?

25:39.170 --> 25:42.628
He needs you, B'Elanna,
now more than ever.

25:45.143 --> 25:46.405
Forget him.

25:46.478 --> 25:49.345
He's not half the man you are.

25:49.414 --> 25:50.779
Mm- hmm. Well...

25:50.849 --> 25:52.544
l've seen enough of this.

25:52.617 --> 25:55.085
All right, let's go
back to Sick Bay

25:55.153 --> 25:56.711
and try to isolate
that algorithm.

26:00.358 --> 26:01.416
Congratulations.

26:01.493 --> 26:03.222
Thank you for this
opportunity, Captain.

26:03.295 --> 26:04.819
All l've ever wanted was

26:04.963 --> 26:06.828
to live up
to my full potential...

26:06.965 --> 26:09.729
to hone all my skills...

26:09.834 --> 26:11.927
expand my abilities...

26:12.037 --> 26:14.597
to help the people l love.

26:21.446 --> 26:24.210
What's the status?

26:24.282 --> 26:26.375
l lost the signal again.

26:26.451 --> 26:28.385
l don't know what happened.

26:28.453 --> 26:31.889
Two assault vessels are
on course to join us.

26:31.957 --> 26:34.357
Accurate information
is essential!

26:34.426 --> 26:36.451
The more l learn about Voyager,

26:36.528 --> 26:39.861
the more l wonder...
if it's worth the trouble.

26:39.931 --> 26:41.592
Clarify.

26:41.666 --> 26:45.432
Launching an attack against
such a heavily armed vessel

26:45.537 --> 26:47.903
carries a great risk
and for what?

26:47.973 --> 26:50.533
A little antimatter
and some dilithium...

26:50.642 --> 26:52.940
Your survey indicated
large quantities of both.

26:53.011 --> 26:55.172
We've already committed
substantial resources

26:55.246 --> 26:56.941
to mounting this assault.

26:57.048 --> 26:57.946
Were you mistaken?

26:58.049 --> 26:58.947
No!

26:59.050 --> 27:00.176
Not at all.

27:00.285 --> 27:01.843
l'm just...

27:01.886 --> 27:04.150
sounding a note of caution.

27:04.222 --> 27:08.124
lf our boarding party
doesn't find Voyager

27:08.193 --> 27:11.390
exactly as you've
described it...

27:11.463 --> 27:14.364
the Hierarchy will be informed.

27:16.434 --> 27:17.867
l understand.

27:17.936 --> 27:20.461
There has been no mistake.

27:23.441 --> 27:24.908
Then we'll proceed.

27:30.115 --> 27:32.709
l've made a terrible mistake.

27:32.784 --> 27:35.184
How... terrible?

27:35.253 --> 27:38.450
The Doctor was appearing
in a different location

27:38.523 --> 27:39.854
every few seconds.

27:39.924 --> 27:41.391
lt didn't seem possible.

27:41.459 --> 27:43.950
So, l investigated
a little further and...

27:45.964 --> 27:49.365
l haven't been monitoring
his perceptions.

27:49.434 --> 27:51.994
l've been watching
his dreams...

27:52.103 --> 27:54.071
or his... his imaginings.

27:54.139 --> 27:55.902
l'm not sure which...

27:57.609 --> 27:59.907
but none of this is real.

28:01.713 --> 28:04.511
What am l going to do?

28:18.229 --> 28:20.754
l came to check on your patient.

28:22.133 --> 28:24.033
He's doing just fine, Captain.

28:24.135 --> 28:26.103
lt took Lieutenant Torres
half the night

28:26.171 --> 28:27.763
to stabilize my matrix,

28:27.872 --> 28:30.705
but l haven't had
a single flight of fancy since.

28:32.911 --> 28:35.880
l apologize for altering
my program without permission.

28:36.014 --> 28:38.005
Well, at least there wasn't
any permanent damage.

28:39.517 --> 28:41.382
l'm afraid there was.

28:41.453 --> 28:43.751
l've been exposed...

28:43.822 --> 28:45.346
humiliated...

28:45.423 --> 28:48.756
turned inside out
for all the world to see.

28:48.827 --> 28:50.624
lf l've lost your respect...

28:50.695 --> 28:53.357
That will never happen...

28:53.431 --> 28:56.662
certainly not because we've seen
a few random fantasies.

28:56.768 --> 28:59.760
We all daydream, Doctor.

28:59.871 --> 29:03.739
lt helps us imagine
other possibilities in life.

29:03.842 --> 29:05.309
Just hold off
until we've figured out

29:05.410 --> 29:06.604
a way for you to do it

29:06.678 --> 29:08.771
without damaging
yourself, all right?

29:16.721 --> 29:18.450
Come in.

29:19.924 --> 29:22.620
Ship status report.

29:22.694 --> 29:24.719
Federation Law.

29:24.796 --> 29:27.128
Thinking about a career change?

29:27.198 --> 29:28.688
ln a way.

29:28.767 --> 29:30.758
Not for me, though.

29:30.835 --> 29:33.303
l've been going over
the legal precedents

29:33.404 --> 29:36.100
for granting command positions
to holograms.

29:36.174 --> 29:37.471
There aren't any.

29:37.542 --> 29:39.703
Captain, this ship
needs its Doctor.

29:39.778 --> 29:42.474
He should focus on what
he was programmed for- -

29:42.547 --> 29:43.980
medical care.

29:44.048 --> 29:45.777
l think we've
underestimated him

29:45.850 --> 29:47.875
because of our own
human limitations.

29:47.986 --> 29:50.147
His full potential's
unknown, Chakotay.

29:50.221 --> 29:52.280
Would you be comfortable
handing over your ship

29:52.357 --> 29:53.346
to a computer program?

29:53.424 --> 29:55.984
Well, l don't know
if l'd take it that far.

29:56.060 --> 29:57.322
You might have to.

29:57.395 --> 29:59.329
He probably won't
settle for less.

30:15.780 --> 30:17.509
Oh, no.

30:17.582 --> 30:21.416
Allow me to shake your hand.

30:21.486 --> 30:24.148
Congratulations.

30:24.222 --> 30:26.622
Doctor, may l please
have a word with you?

30:26.691 --> 30:28.488
l don't recall dreaming you up.

30:28.560 --> 30:29.584
You didn't.

30:29.661 --> 30:31.856
l'm transmitting
a simulation of myself

30:31.930 --> 30:34.398
into your program,
but l am real.

30:34.465 --> 30:35.432
Doctor to the Bridge.

30:35.500 --> 30:37.365
l'm daydreaming again.
Somebody deactivate me.

30:37.468 --> 30:38.958
Voyager is
about to be attacked.

30:39.103 --> 30:40.127
Of course it is,

30:40.238 --> 30:42.297
unless the valiant Doctor
swings into action, right?

30:42.407 --> 30:43.635
Yes, yes, precisely.

30:43.708 --> 30:45.005
A common theme
in all my fantasies.

30:45.109 --> 30:47.009
l reactivated your
cognitive algorithms.

30:47.078 --> 30:49.512
l put you back into
this... fiction.

30:50.582 --> 30:53.551
Here. Why?

30:53.618 --> 30:57.054
lt was the only way for me
to communicate with you.

31:02.193 --> 31:03.285
l'm listening.

31:03.361 --> 31:06.524
l'm a long- range observer
on an assault- class vessel.

31:06.598 --> 31:07.826
l scan passing ships

31:07.899 --> 31:09.890
for technology
and raw materials.

31:10.034 --> 31:12.662
When l find an acceptable
target, we raid it.

31:12.770 --> 31:14.328
You've been spying on us.

31:14.439 --> 31:16.031
More to the point- - on you.

31:16.140 --> 31:17.937
For several days,
l've been using

31:18.009 --> 31:21.137
a long- range tunneling sensor
to tap into your program.

31:21.212 --> 31:24.648
You were supposed to be
our eyes and ears on Voyager.

31:24.716 --> 31:27.776
lnstead, l got this.

31:27.852 --> 31:29.342
My daydreams?!

31:29.420 --> 31:31.388
You tapped into my daydreams?!

31:31.456 --> 31:33.856
That's why my algorithms
have been destabilizing.

31:33.925 --> 31:35.085
My fault.

31:35.159 --> 31:36.956
l'm sorry.

31:37.095 --> 31:38.653
Tell me about this attack.

31:38.730 --> 31:40.789
My ship is less
than an hour away.

31:40.865 --> 31:42.765
l can help you avoid
a confrontation,

31:42.834 --> 31:45.530
but you must do
exactly what l say.

31:45.637 --> 31:47.628
Why should you want to help us?

31:47.739 --> 31:49.036
You don't understand.

31:50.608 --> 31:52.906
The Hierarchy
does not tolerate mistakes

31:52.977 --> 31:55.172
or misinformation.

31:55.246 --> 31:57.771
lf they learn of my error...

31:59.150 --> 32:01.209
l'll lose my livelihood.

32:01.319 --> 32:05.517
Well, that's what you get
for being a Peeping Tom.

32:06.991 --> 32:10.290
But l also care
about what happens to you.

32:10.361 --> 32:13.091
l feel like
l've gotten to know you

32:13.164 --> 32:14.893
over the past few days.

32:14.999 --> 32:17.900
You've been spying
on my fantasies, not me.

32:18.002 --> 32:19.663
You don't know me at all.

32:19.771 --> 32:21.238
But l do.

32:21.306 --> 32:25.174
l know how your mind works...

32:25.243 --> 32:27.677
what your hopes are.

32:27.745 --> 32:30.543
You created all these...

32:30.615 --> 32:32.515
possibilities.

32:32.583 --> 32:34.744
My species, we're...

32:34.819 --> 32:36.116
very different.

32:36.187 --> 32:39.953
Our thinking is confined, but...

32:40.024 --> 32:41.958
l can't help...

32:42.093 --> 32:43.526
but admire you.

32:45.096 --> 32:49.226
l don't want you to be harmed.

32:52.470 --> 32:55.303
Then l suppose we should
swing into action.

32:58.843 --> 33:00.435
Captain, we're
about to be attacked.

33:00.545 --> 33:02.035
Alien vessels are approaching.

33:03.047 --> 33:04.412
There's nothing
on the sensors, Doc.

33:04.482 --> 33:05.414
The vessels are cloaked.

33:05.483 --> 33:06.415
How do you know this?

33:06.484 --> 33:07.610
One of the aliens contacted me.

33:07.685 --> 33:08.845
l've detected no transmissions.

33:08.920 --> 33:09.978
He spoke to me in a daydream.

33:10.054 --> 33:10.986
l don't want to hear it.

33:11.055 --> 33:12.545
However, l would like to know

33:12.623 --> 33:14.523
why you've disobeyed
my direct order.

33:14.592 --> 33:15.854
l can prove it to you.

33:15.927 --> 33:18.691
The alien told me
how to reconfigure our sensors

33:18.763 --> 33:21.163
to compensate
for their cloaking field.

33:27.705 --> 33:29.138
He's right.

33:29.207 --> 33:30.606
l'm picking up three ships

33:30.675 --> 33:33.735
out there- - distance,
600 million kilometers,

33:33.811 --> 33:34.778
headed right for us.

33:34.846 --> 33:36.245
On screen.

33:37.648 --> 33:40.913
Maximum magnification.

33:53.097 --> 33:55.429
The alien won't help us
unless we help him.

33:55.500 --> 33:56.967
What if this is all

33:57.068 --> 33:58.558
part of their attack?
A ruse?

33:58.669 --> 34:00.728
He's already helped us
compensate for their cloak.

34:00.838 --> 34:02.169
l'm inclined to believe him.

34:02.240 --> 34:04.037
So am l, but l'd
just as soon set a course

34:04.108 --> 34:05.405
away from here
at maximum warp.

34:05.476 --> 34:07.273
That will only delay
a confrontation.

34:07.345 --> 34:09.677
They have vessels hidden
throughout the entire sector.

34:09.746 --> 34:11.873
Did your friend have a plan?

34:11.983 --> 34:13.848
He said they're
running what's called

34:13.918 --> 34:14.850
a type- 3 stealth assault.

34:14.918 --> 34:16.318
They won't de- cloak
until they're right

34:16.387 --> 34:17.547
on top of us, at which point

34:17.621 --> 34:19.522
they'll fire a warning
shot across our bow.

34:19.590 --> 34:22.184
Then come the demands- - 
for supplies and technology.

34:22.260 --> 34:24.284
lf we don't comply,
they'll destroy us.

34:24.362 --> 34:26.489
Fortunately, the alien promised

34:26.563 --> 34:29.829
to transmit the resonance
frequencies of their phasers.

34:29.900 --> 34:31.333
And in return?

34:32.737 --> 34:34.329
ln return...

34:36.174 --> 34:38.438
He mistakenly informed
his superiors

34:38.509 --> 34:41.842
that l was in command
of Voyager.

34:41.913 --> 34:43.777
To keep himself
from being demoted,

34:43.848 --> 34:45.440
he wants us...

34:45.516 --> 34:47.074
to maintain that fiction.

34:47.150 --> 34:49.244
When they open the channel,

34:49.320 --> 34:51.447
l have to be sitting
in the Captain's chair.

34:51.522 --> 34:55.253
l'm sorry, Captain...
but he insisted.

34:58.129 --> 35:01.621
Well, l guess it's time
to turn fantasy into reality.

35:05.002 --> 35:06.196
l'm in over my head.

35:06.304 --> 35:07.669
What if l fail?

35:07.738 --> 35:09.171
You sound like l did

35:09.240 --> 35:11.868
when the Captain put me
in command of the night shift.

35:11.976 --> 35:13.170
That chair looked so big,

35:13.244 --> 35:14.871
l thought l'd sink
so far into it

35:14.979 --> 35:16.708
that nobody
would be able to see me.

35:16.781 --> 35:19.045
But you had your Academy
training to fall back on.

35:19.117 --> 35:21.517
Yeah, well, sounds like you've
had plenty of practice.

35:21.586 --> 35:22.848
That wasn't real.

35:22.920 --> 35:24.615
Listen, Doc...
the whole reason

35:24.689 --> 35:26.520
you wanted to be
able to daydream

35:26.591 --> 35:30.357
was to test out
possibilities, right?

35:30.428 --> 35:33.056
Well, consider
this a field test.

35:36.167 --> 35:38.692
Why isn't there any hull damage
from the Borg attack?

35:38.803 --> 35:40.703
They... repaired it.

35:40.771 --> 35:43.239
So quickly? Hmm.

35:45.309 --> 35:47.470
Prepare for type- 4 assault.

35:47.545 --> 35:48.944
Type- 4?

35:49.013 --> 35:51.538
That would cause a huge drain
on our energy core- -

35:51.616 --> 35:54.414
a... a, a waste of resources.

35:54.485 --> 35:56.783
Do you really think
that's necessary?

35:56.854 --> 35:58.344
What l think doesn't matter.

35:58.422 --> 36:02.188
Your long- range surveillance
indicated an attack by Borg.

36:02.293 --> 36:05.091
On closer inspection,
that appears to be doubtful.

36:05.129 --> 36:07.927
Your report on this vessel
could be mistaken.

36:07.999 --> 36:10.058
l think caution is in order.

36:19.677 --> 36:22.510
The Hierarchy agrees.

36:24.048 --> 36:25.845
Proceed to type- 4.

36:35.826 --> 36:37.657
Captain on the Bridge.

36:55.846 --> 36:57.074
lt won't bite.

36:58.816 --> 37:01.478
What l wouldn't give right now
for a whoopee cushion.

37:01.586 --> 37:02.518
A what?

37:03.955 --> 37:05.513
Ancient technology.

37:29.247 --> 37:30.839
Captain, we're ready to proceed.

37:30.915 --> 37:33.406
Acknowledged, Commander.

37:33.484 --> 37:35.645
The internal
com- link is active.

37:35.720 --> 37:38.120
No one will be able to
hear you but the Doctor.

37:38.189 --> 37:40.851
Doctor, are you ready?

37:40.925 --> 37:43.018
No, but do l have a choice?

37:43.094 --> 37:45.085
l'll be with you
every step of the way.

37:45.162 --> 37:48.097
Just remember,
l'm still the Captain.

37:48.165 --> 37:49.291
Understood.

37:49.367 --> 37:50.356
l'm receiving

37:50.468 --> 37:52.663
a transmission
on a secure channel- -

37:52.770 --> 37:53.737
audio only.

37:53.838 --> 37:55.305
Must be the Doctor's friend.

37:55.373 --> 37:56.897
Let's hear what he has to say.

37:57.008 --> 37:58.737
Doctor?

37:58.809 --> 37:59.935
Hello?

38:00.011 --> 38:02.002
Voyager here.

38:02.046 --> 38:03.479
lt's me.

38:03.547 --> 38:06.380
Doctor,
something terrible has happened.

38:06.450 --> 38:09.942
They've ordered
a type- 4 assault.

38:10.021 --> 38:12.990
Our phaser frequencies
will be rotated continuously.

38:13.057 --> 38:16.026
l won't be able to help you.

38:16.093 --> 38:17.025
Evasive maneuvers.

38:17.094 --> 38:18.026
Three vessels

38:18.095 --> 38:19.562
are de- cloaking
off the port bow.

38:23.467 --> 38:25.435
That didn't feel like
a warning shot.

38:25.536 --> 38:27.401
Direct hit.
Shields are holding.

38:27.471 --> 38:28.563
They're hailing us.

38:30.141 --> 38:31.403
This is it, Doctor.

38:31.475 --> 38:33.033
On screen.

38:35.313 --> 38:36.871
You see? There he is.

38:37.014 --> 38:38.140
Uh...

38:38.215 --> 38:39.648
be careful.

38:39.717 --> 38:42.208
He- he- he's dangerous.

38:44.355 --> 38:46.983
The Hierarchy controls
this region of space.

38:47.058 --> 38:50.050
Your ship has supplies
and technology that we require.

38:50.127 --> 38:52.288
Tell him
we'll defend ourselves.

38:52.363 --> 38:54.854
They won't get
what they're after.

38:54.932 --> 38:56.160
We'll defend ourselves.

38:56.267 --> 38:57.825
They won't get
what they're after.

38:57.935 --> 38:59.493
Huh?

38:59.603 --> 39:01.434
l mean you...
won't get what you're after.

39:01.539 --> 39:03.803
Not in a million years.

39:03.841 --> 39:05.536
Not if l have anything
to say about it!

39:05.609 --> 39:07.076
Don't improvise, Doctor.

39:07.144 --> 39:08.441
Sorry.

39:10.781 --> 39:12.112
An exchange of fire

39:12.183 --> 39:14.947
would damage both of our ships,
but we have support nearby.

39:15.019 --> 39:16.816
You are alone.

39:16.887 --> 39:19.947
Take your weapons off- line
and prepare to be b...

39:20.024 --> 39:22.390
Excuse the interruption,
Commander.

39:22.460 --> 39:25.429
l've found a potential weakness
in their shields,

39:25.496 --> 39:28.056
but l'll need time
to reconfigure our phasers.

39:28.132 --> 39:29.827
Keep him occupied, Doctor.

39:29.900 --> 39:30.889
On screen.

39:32.570 --> 39:33.764
This is my final warning.

39:33.871 --> 39:35.304
Don't... rush me.

39:35.373 --> 39:38.308
Take your weapons off- line.
lmmediately.

39:38.376 --> 39:39.843
l won't ask again.

39:39.910 --> 39:41.036
You...

39:41.112 --> 39:45.276
appear to be suffering from
a physio- emotive disorder.

39:45.349 --> 39:47.840
You're impatient,
quick to anger.

39:47.918 --> 39:50.853
Do you have any idea what that
does to your vascular pressure?

39:50.921 --> 39:52.286
You may want to see a physician.

39:52.356 --> 39:54.153
Firing phasers.

39:57.294 --> 39:58.386
Direct hit.

39:58.462 --> 39:59.622
Ha!

39:59.697 --> 40:00.891
How do you like that, huh?

40:00.965 --> 40:02.330
A taste of your own medicine!

40:02.400 --> 40:03.833
Tone it down, Doctor.

40:03.901 --> 40:04.890
Sorry.

40:11.609 --> 40:13.270
Our phasers are off- line.

40:13.344 --> 40:14.811
Prepare to be boarded.

40:14.912 --> 40:17.346
lt's time to negotiate, Doctor.
Tell them...

40:17.415 --> 40:18.541
Tuvok!

40:24.889 --> 40:28.381
Activate the photonic cannon.

40:32.630 --> 40:34.063
Tuvok, that was an order!

40:38.068 --> 40:41.003
Activating
the photonic cannon...

40:41.138 --> 40:42.366
sir.

40:42.473 --> 40:45.636
l'd rather not give the order
to fire.

40:47.211 --> 40:49.736
My sensors are showing
no activation sequence.

40:49.814 --> 40:51.111
Of course not.

40:51.182 --> 40:53.514
The photonic cannon
is impervious to sensors.

40:53.584 --> 40:55.779
The Borg couldn't
detect it either.

40:55.853 --> 40:57.821
That's why they were destroyed.

40:57.888 --> 40:59.753
The Borg, the Hierarchy- -

40:59.824 --> 41:01.621
it's all the same to me.

41:01.725 --> 41:05.286
Just another bully who didn't
know when to back off.

41:05.329 --> 41:07.422
We'll be vaporized.

41:23.080 --> 41:25.776
The Hierarchy suggests retreat.

41:30.988 --> 41:33.923
They're moving away
at maximum impulse.

41:42.600 --> 41:44.625
Go ahead, Doctor.

41:44.735 --> 41:46.703
You've earned it.

41:59.650 --> 42:01.948
Seven of Nine to the Doctor.

42:02.052 --> 42:03.314
Go ahead.

42:03.354 --> 42:05.948
l require your assistance
in the Mess Hall.

42:07.391 --> 42:08.790
l'll be right there.

42:14.932 --> 42:15.864
Surprise!

42:16.934 --> 42:18.697
Don't worry, Doc.

42:18.802 --> 42:19.769
You're not dreaming.

42:19.870 --> 42:20.962
Captain?

42:24.008 --> 42:27.842
For your imaginative defense
of this ship and her crew,

42:27.912 --> 42:30.904
l'm awarding you the Starfleet
Medal of Commendation.

42:30.981 --> 42:33.176
Congratulations.

42:33.250 --> 42:34.239
Thank you.

42:34.318 --> 42:36.513
l've also reconsidered
your request.

42:36.587 --> 42:38.885
l'm going to authorize
a research project

42:38.956 --> 42:40.890
to explore
your command abilities.

42:40.958 --> 42:42.220
You're a natural.

42:45.763 --> 42:47.321
Congratulations, Doctor.

42:50.901 --> 42:53.369
That was a platonic gesture.

42:53.470 --> 42:54.960
Don't expect me to pose for you.

42:55.139 --> 42:56.731
Noted.
