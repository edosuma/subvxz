00:19.928 --> 00:22.079
-Ow. Ow. Ow.
-Ow. Ow. Ow...

00:22.097 --> 00:23.413
I never thought
Andy would beat me

00:23.432 --> 00:25.190
in the "leaping off
the bus stop bench" game,

00:25.342 --> 00:26.767
but that was one hell of a leap.

00:26.861 --> 00:29.695
I don't know about the "leaping
off the bus stop bench" game.

00:29.922 --> 00:31.088
Andy almost broke his leg.

00:31.090 --> 00:32.272
I didn't say
he stuck the landing.

00:32.366 --> 00:34.274
Wait, Ollie, you didn't
skin your knee.

00:34.368 --> 00:37.536
He hit my leg with a rock
so I could feel what he feels.

00:37.763 --> 00:38.853
You're welcome.

00:38.931 --> 00:40.372
Oh, hello, free mirror
that someone

00:40.524 --> 00:42.599
carelessly left on the curb
for children to find.

00:42.618 --> 00:46.103
Okay, how are we smashing this?
Anyone got a bowling ball, or...

00:46.196 --> 00:48.547
Maybe we could just use it
to make sure we're not vampires?

00:48.698 --> 00:50.365
And we're not.
Phew.

00:50.384 --> 00:52.217
Maybe we could point the mirror
up and signal an airplane?

00:52.444 --> 00:54.386
And then maybe we could
become friends with an airplane.

00:54.538 --> 00:58.131
What? No. Come on,
it's a mirror made of glass.

00:58.284 --> 01:00.133
-And glass breaks!
-I think

01:00.286 --> 01:02.561
Andy's had enough
excitement for one day.

01:02.712 --> 01:05.564
I need time to recuperate
and center myself. And pee.

01:05.749 --> 01:08.125
Also, there's the whole
"seven years bad luck" thing.

01:08.127 --> 01:10.069
Seven years?
That's the amount of time

01:10.296 --> 01:11.795
Brad Pitt spent in Tibet.

01:11.888 --> 01:12.979
Louise, why do you always
want to do

01:13.074 --> 01:15.056
the most dangerous things
all the time?

01:15.076 --> 01:18.318
Whoa, whoa. Smashing a mirror
is not dangerous.

01:18.487 --> 01:19.745
It's called fun.

01:19.896 --> 01:22.564
No? Just me?

01:22.658 --> 01:24.249
I mean, I think it's great that
you love doing scary stuff

01:24.401 --> 01:26.326
that makes me shut my eyes
and think

01:26.420 --> 01:27.419
"when will this be over?"

01:27.571 --> 01:29.146
Fine.
This doesn't even look like

01:29.164 --> 01:30.997
a good smashing mirror anyway,

01:31.150 --> 01:32.407
so I'm just gonna
leave it for the next

01:32.484 --> 01:35.335
perfectly normal kid
who wants to smash it.

01:35.487 --> 01:38.004
We'll figure out another way
to be friends with an airplane.

01:38.157 --> 01:39.264
Hi. I'll take a beer.

01:39.416 --> 01:41.916
Louise, no.
We-we don't give her beer.

01:42.010 --> 01:43.769
What's wrong, sweetie?
You have a rough day?

01:43.920 --> 01:46.271
Is it school? Did you think
something had one answer

01:46.423 --> 01:47.831
but then it had a different
answer and you were like,

01:47.924 --> 01:48.774
"What the heck?"

01:48.925 --> 01:50.350
I'm fine. We just, you know,

01:50.444 --> 01:53.261
found a perfectly good mirror
to smash on the way home

01:53.280 --> 01:55.355
and everybody made me
feel weird about it.

01:55.449 --> 01:57.023
Ooh, I love smashing
a good mirror.

01:57.176 --> 01:58.817
-Lin.
-Right. Playing with glass

01:58.969 --> 02:00.844
isn't a good idea.
You could get cut.

02:00.863 --> 02:01.862
Yeah, you could get cut.

02:01.956 --> 02:03.013
I thought
that was part of the fun.

02:03.031 --> 02:04.531
It's just, your fun

02:04.683 --> 02:07.609
sometimes involves things
that terrify me?

02:07.628 --> 02:11.004
(grunting, exclaiming)

02:12.466 --> 02:14.967
What's your point? Look,
if I'm too cool and exciting

02:15.118 --> 02:16.693
for people, then forget 'em.

02:16.786 --> 02:19.304
They can just be boring
and do their boring stuff.

02:19.456 --> 02:22.957
Louise, don't smash mirrors.
Because they don't deserve that.

02:22.977 --> 02:24.885
I mean, they taunt you
every day, don't they?

02:24.979 --> 02:26.311
They really do.

02:26.463 --> 02:28.388
Louise, I guess smashing glass

02:28.540 --> 02:31.257
can be a little off-putting
to some people, maybe.

02:31.393 --> 02:33.226
But don't give up on those
people. I mean, you don't want

02:33.395 --> 02:36.213
to end up like your father.
Without, you know, any friends.

02:36.231 --> 02:38.640
-What? I have friends.
-No.

02:38.734 --> 02:40.734
Dad has friends. Teddy...

02:40.886 --> 02:42.977
I shouldn't have made that sound
like I was gonna have a list.

02:43.071 --> 02:45.313
People come visit Dad
in the restaurant every day.

02:45.332 --> 02:46.147
Right, sir?

02:46.241 --> 02:47.908
-Um...
-Ignore them. Okay,

02:48.060 --> 02:49.317
first of all,
why is this about me now?

02:49.411 --> 02:51.336
And second of all,
I have friends that aren't

02:51.413 --> 02:53.063
paying customers.
I just, you know,

02:53.156 --> 02:54.989
lost touch with a bunch of them.

02:55.009 --> 02:56.400
Back when I was a teenager.

02:56.418 --> 02:58.343
Is it because there were
no telephones back then?

02:58.495 --> 03:02.163
I'm gonna go in the kitchen.
Where everyone's nice to me.

03:02.241 --> 03:04.183
I mean, the dishwasher
doesn't like you.

03:04.351 --> 03:05.075
I know.

03:05.093 --> 03:06.334
<i> LOUISE:</i>
<i> Dumb super</i>

03:06.353 --> 03:08.002
smashable mirror.
(scoffs)

03:08.022 --> 03:11.148
I don't know why people
got so dumb about it.

03:12.193 --> 03:13.433
Oh. Hey there, spider.

03:13.527 --> 03:16.920
You're... in my room.
On my loft bed.

03:16.922 --> 03:18.605
But you know what?
You're kind of

03:18.699 --> 03:21.258
unconventionally cute.
You would tell me if you were

03:21.427 --> 03:24.761
super venomous, right?
Yeah, you look like you would.

03:24.780 --> 03:26.279
I like that about you.

03:26.432 --> 03:28.932
See? Look at all the friends
I have in here. Jack.

03:28.951 --> 03:30.934
Who's Jack? Probably
a really good friend.

03:31.027 --> 03:33.954
Oh, I know who this is.
He dinged our car

03:34.048 --> 03:36.030
-and never called me back.
-Aw, Jack.

03:36.124 --> 03:38.366
Okay, this is ridiculous.
I have to have friends I see

03:38.385 --> 03:39.867
that aren't Teddy and the people

03:39.962 --> 03:42.446
that buy food from us.
Oh, hey, Cliff.

03:42.464 --> 03:44.205
Who's Cliff? I don't know Cliff.
It's a good name, though.

03:44.299 --> 03:46.725
Hey, I'm going out with Cliff.
Back in a jiff. Ha.

03:46.876 --> 03:48.301
I met him
at a back-to-school night.

03:48.454 --> 03:50.787
He was trying to organize a
basketball thing for the kids,

03:50.789 --> 03:52.898
so we exchanged numbers.
I didn't have the heart

03:53.049 --> 03:54.882
to tell him
our kids don't do stuff.

03:54.902 --> 03:58.295
Hey, Cliff, don't fall off
yourself. Ha. You can use that.

03:58.388 --> 04:01.389
He seemed like a person that
I could do activities with.

04:01.483 --> 04:04.134
-Is that what people say?
-Maybe don't open with that.

04:04.227 --> 04:06.394
Should I text him?
Is it too late?

04:06.413 --> 04:07.487
It's never too late for Cliff.

04:07.639 --> 04:09.973
Okay, I'll do it.
Wait, no, it's too late.

04:10.066 --> 04:11.899
Oh, God,
I just texted him the letter I.

04:11.994 --> 04:14.544
-What do I do?
-Okay, gimme the phone.

04:16.090 --> 04:18.257
(yawns) Hey, Spider,
you're still here.

04:18.408 --> 04:20.074
And you built a web?
Impressive.

04:20.094 --> 04:22.744
Borderline showing
off, but I like it.

04:22.763 --> 04:25.264
Hey, I was thinking,
if we're gonna be roommates,

04:25.415 --> 04:27.099
I should probably
give you a name.

04:27.250 --> 04:29.268
How do you feel
about Winona Spider?

04:29.419 --> 04:31.661
Wait-- Arachnaphoebe.
Phoebe for short.

04:31.680 --> 04:34.547
You don't really get
excited about things, do you?

04:34.699 --> 04:36.275
That's all right.
I know it's a great name.

04:36.502 --> 04:37.609
Morning, sweetie.

04:37.761 --> 04:39.669
I need to get your
dirty laundry for the wash.

04:39.688 --> 04:41.095
I don't know about you,
but I'm about to start

04:41.115 --> 04:43.189
wearing my bathing suit bottoms
for underwear.

04:43.358 --> 04:46.601
Ooh! Uh, okay. Uh, spider.
We got a spider, people.

04:46.620 --> 04:48.011
Mom, no, it's okay.

04:48.030 --> 04:49.846
Th-This is Phoebe.
Phoebe, this is my mom.

04:49.865 --> 04:51.439
I know this is
a little early to be

04:51.517 --> 04:54.459
in the meeting-the-parents
phase, but here we are.

04:54.686 --> 04:56.611
Did you say spider? Here, Linda,
I brought a paper towel.

04:56.705 --> 04:58.872
Dad, are you making Mom
kill a bug for you again?

04:58.966 --> 05:00.707
I'm not making her.
We just have our roles.

05:00.859 --> 05:04.528
I bring a paper towel, and your
mom does everything else.

05:04.546 --> 05:07.030
He doesn't like to get his
hands dirty. Like a mob boss.

05:07.049 --> 05:09.141
Hey, the spider's with me.
We're friends.

05:09.292 --> 05:12.126
It has a name. Arachnaphoebe.
Phoebe for short.

05:12.146 --> 05:13.478
But never Pheebs.
She hates that.

05:13.705 --> 05:15.430
Now, can you holster
the paper towel, please?

05:15.482 --> 05:17.965
Louise, we don't have
anything against Phoebe.

05:17.985 --> 05:20.544
I'm sure she's great,
but she's a spider

05:20.637 --> 05:23.822
and they belong outside.
Not in our home. Where we live.

05:23.973 --> 05:26.140
Yeah, and if they come
inside our home or restaurant,

05:26.160 --> 05:28.976
then we kill them.
Lovingly. That's the contract

05:29.145 --> 05:31.721
that we all agreed to.
Mostly us, not the bugs.

05:31.740 --> 05:32.889
What about relocation?

05:33.058 --> 05:35.575
-I hear outside is nice.
-Yeah, okay.

05:35.669 --> 05:37.985
Uh, Louise, you want to tell her
she doesn't have to go home

05:38.005 --> 05:39.746
but she can't stay here?
Go get a cup.

05:39.898 --> 05:42.065
A bottle of wine would be
a nice send-off gesture.

05:42.158 --> 05:44.234
She's fine right here, people.
You're the ones who

05:44.252 --> 05:47.012
came in here uninvited. I'm
not trapping you under a cup.

05:47.239 --> 05:49.406
Sorry, kid. It's either
outside or one-way ticket

05:49.575 --> 05:51.683
to paper towel town.
Your choice.

05:51.910 --> 05:53.577
And then I need
everyone's laundry.

05:53.670 --> 05:55.912
Also, everyone feel free
to learn how to do laundry.

05:55.931 --> 05:58.431
Ugh. Okay, Phoebe.
Pack your stuff.

05:58.584 --> 06:00.025
You're too good
for this place anyway.

06:00.176 --> 06:02.844
And maybe she could tell
other spiders not to come here?

06:02.863 --> 06:04.196
-In-in a nice way.
-No.

06:04.423 --> 06:05.438
-Okay.
-(phone dings)

06:05.532 --> 06:07.107
Oh, it's Cliff.

06:07.201 --> 06:08.258
He-he texted me back.

06:08.276 --> 06:09.701
Cliff? That big red dog?

06:09.853 --> 06:11.519
-He has your number?
-That's the guy your dad's

06:11.613 --> 06:14.039
-trying to be friends with.
-I mean, we're already friends.

06:14.266 --> 06:17.784
Kind of. I was gonna ask him
if he wants to hang out.

06:17.953 --> 06:20.286
Wait, you're asking a guy out?
To prom? Dad prom?

06:20.439 --> 06:21.955
What's the theme
this year-- khakis?

06:22.049 --> 06:24.883
It's not dad prom.
It's casual, and also,

06:25.034 --> 06:26.626
I'm getting pretty good
at texting.

06:26.720 --> 06:29.946
I just make sure your mother
looks at all of them first.

06:29.965 --> 06:31.205
Mom, you want to run them by me?

06:31.225 --> 06:32.632
And then Tina
can run them by me

06:32.784 --> 06:35.376
and then I'll run them
up through corporate.

06:35.396 --> 06:36.895
Okay, Phoebe.
Out into the world

06:37.122 --> 06:39.064
you go to seek your fortune.
Try to avoid

06:39.233 --> 06:42.959
the cars and all the bikes
and people's feet.

06:42.978 --> 06:44.794
God, do people
always walk so hard?

06:44.888 --> 06:47.388
Okay, you know, let's go look
in other neighborhoods.

06:47.408 --> 06:49.741
I mean, yes,
it's our stinky dumpster,

06:49.893 --> 06:51.392
but at least
you won't get trampled.

06:51.486 --> 06:53.245
Spiders can't die of smell,
can they?

06:53.396 --> 06:54.746
I mean, if so,
I'm sure our house

06:54.973 --> 06:56.322
would have killed you already.

06:56.475 --> 06:58.566
All right. So long, Phoebe.

06:58.585 --> 07:01.569
And hey, don't let anybody
tell you spiders are bad.

07:01.663 --> 07:02.754
I think you're delightful.

07:02.906 --> 07:04.664
Well, I'll let you get going.

07:04.758 --> 07:06.040
Goodbye.

07:07.002 --> 07:09.076
Go on, Phoebe. Get.
You got to find cover, pal.

07:09.096 --> 07:11.988
You can't just hang out there,
a bird could get you.

07:11.990 --> 07:13.915
Or... I don't know
what eats spiders.

07:13.934 --> 07:15.559
A spider monkey?

07:16.419 --> 07:17.677
Don't look at me like that.

07:18.588 --> 07:21.064
What?
What do you want me to do?

07:22.167 --> 07:23.475
(sighs)
Okay. New plan.

07:23.627 --> 07:25.610
We're gonna sneak back
into the house.

07:25.837 --> 07:27.446
And no one
needs to know, because

07:27.597 --> 07:29.005
this is just
a me-and-you thing.

07:29.174 --> 07:31.450
We're gonna stick together.
(chuckles) Stick.

07:31.601 --> 07:32.951
It's funny because
you're a spider

07:33.178 --> 07:34.953
and you make the sticky stuff.
Look, Phoebe,

07:35.104 --> 07:36.346
if we're gonna be friends,
you're gonna

07:36.364 --> 07:38.206
have to start
laughing at my jokes.

07:42.445 --> 07:44.111
Okay, Phoebe. I know
it's not what you're used to,

07:44.164 --> 07:46.298
being stuck in a box,
but I need to keep this

07:46.467 --> 07:48.449
living arrangement under wraps
because of the whole

07:48.618 --> 07:50.360
"spiders aren't supposed
to be in the house" thing.

07:50.529 --> 07:52.637
Also, I hope the twigs
are to your liking.

07:52.789 --> 07:55.140
I picked out the ones that
looked the best for climbing

07:55.291 --> 07:57.142
or just casual lounging.

07:57.293 --> 07:58.626
Are you hungry?
You look hungry.

07:58.720 --> 07:59.886
I'll get you something to eat.

08:00.038 --> 08:01.980
But what do you eat?
Do you like chips?

08:02.131 --> 08:04.465
Everyone likes chips.
Fine, I'll look it up.

08:04.559 --> 08:05.725
Don't yell at me.

08:05.877 --> 08:08.636
Okay, a little secret
online spider research

08:08.655 --> 08:10.638
while everyone's
down in the restaurant. Hmm.

08:10.732 --> 08:15.068
"House spiders, like many
spiders, prefer live prey"?

08:15.220 --> 08:16.661
Okay. No judgement.

08:16.813 --> 08:19.498
I'll just look for the prey
that have it coming.

08:19.725 --> 08:22.167
Would you guys want to go
to my menu-wiping seminar

08:22.318 --> 08:24.669
called "It's Men-You,
Not Men-Me"?

08:24.896 --> 08:26.004
-Oh.
-Yes.
-No.

08:26.081 --> 08:28.231
Okay, uh, taking out the trash.

08:28.250 --> 08:29.899
Totally normal part of my job.

08:29.918 --> 08:31.067
Someone's on the ball today.

08:31.160 --> 08:32.919
Kinda jealous I didn't
get to do it first.

08:32.996 --> 08:35.514
Louise, hold on a sec.
That bag's half empty.

08:35.665 --> 08:38.258
Some people might think that,
Mom. But I'm an optimist.

08:38.352 --> 08:40.018
So, to me, it's half full.

08:40.187 --> 08:42.579
Of dreams and rotten food.

08:42.672 --> 08:44.505
And we don't want it
to attract bugs, do we?

08:44.583 --> 08:48.175
(stilted laughing)
Okay, anyways, don't wait up.

08:48.195 --> 08:49.602
-All right.
-(phone dings)

08:49.696 --> 08:52.697
It's Cliff. He said he'd love
to hang out sometime.

08:52.849 --> 08:54.424
Ooh, he likes you.

08:54.442 --> 08:56.034
Did you tell him
the Cliff joke I told you?

08:56.185 --> 08:58.537
Tell him you're busy. Then say,
"I'll check my schedule

08:58.688 --> 09:00.113
and try to make it work.
No promises, though."

09:00.265 --> 09:02.207
Or tell him you're gonna
pick him up on your motorcycle

09:02.434 --> 09:04.768
in five, then get your ass
a motorcycle!

09:04.861 --> 09:07.270
Look at you,
middle-aged buddies.

09:07.363 --> 09:08.880
You two gonna
talk about documentaries

09:09.032 --> 09:11.049
and how many times
you get up at night to pee?

09:11.200 --> 09:12.217
-(chuckles)
-(phone dings)

09:12.444 --> 09:14.110
Oh. Cliff just
added me to a group chat

09:14.203 --> 09:15.703
with some other dads
from school

09:15.797 --> 09:17.447
that hang out together
sometimes.

09:17.465 --> 09:19.040
-(phone dinging)
-Wow, he moves fast.

09:19.059 --> 09:20.800
Two of the guys
just welcomed me to the chat.

09:20.894 --> 09:23.803
Thanks. Hi, guys.

09:23.897 --> 09:25.288
Someone's the belle of the ball.

09:25.307 --> 09:26.881
(chuckles)
One of them just wrote,

09:26.900 --> 09:29.142
"Just a bunch of dads
to the bone."

09:29.294 --> 09:31.069
I'm gonna write something
funny back.

09:31.296 --> 09:34.480
Um,<i> Dad Boys II.</i>
Like the movie?

09:34.633 --> 09:36.074
-Oh, God, can I delete?
-(phone dings)

09:36.301 --> 09:37.634
Oh, no, wait,
one of them laughed.

09:37.803 --> 09:39.244
-Oh, thank God.
-(phone dinging)
-(entry bells jingle)

09:39.471 --> 09:40.895
Whoa, someone's
getting some texts.

09:40.914 --> 09:43.415
Dad's in a group chat with
Cliff and some other cute boys.

09:43.642 --> 09:45.733
I mean, they may be cute,
we don't know. And they're men.

09:45.752 --> 09:48.494
Bob's on a group chat with
people? Like, friend people?

09:48.589 --> 09:50.422
That's great.
That's nice, that's great.

09:50.573 --> 09:52.573
Bob's trying to make a friend
that's not a customer.

09:52.593 --> 09:55.743
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Customers
can be friends. Best friends.

09:55.762 --> 09:57.670
But hey, you want me to stop
coming in here to eat?

09:57.764 --> 09:59.339
Is that what you want?
I'll stop.

09:59.491 --> 10:00.673
If that's what it takes
for our friendship.

10:00.826 --> 10:02.659
Just make me, like,
200 burgers and I'll never

10:02.752 --> 10:05.252
step in here again.
Unless it's in disguise.

10:05.347 --> 10:06.996
It's okay, Teddy.
We're-we're friends.

10:07.165 --> 10:09.423
Huh, what's taking Louise
so long with the trash?

10:09.501 --> 10:11.276
Tina, Gene, you want
to check on your sister?

10:11.427 --> 10:13.094
Okay. Hopefully,
she didn't accidentally

10:13.113 --> 10:14.446
fall in the dumpster
while throwing the trash out,

10:14.597 --> 10:16.615
which has never,
ever happened to me.

10:16.842 --> 10:19.008
-(phone continues dinging)
-Maybe switch it
to vibrate, Bob?

10:19.027 --> 10:20.768
Just kinda rubbing it in, eh?

10:20.862 --> 10:23.179
Ugh. Come on, flies.
Let me catch you.

10:23.198 --> 10:25.198
I'm totally not gonna
feed you to my spider.

10:25.292 --> 10:27.200
-Louise, what are you doing?
-Oh! Nothing.

10:27.352 --> 10:29.110
Just, uh, throwing out
the trash.

10:29.129 --> 10:31.187
And, uh, trying to catch flies
and put them

10:31.206 --> 10:32.947
in this Tupperware thing,
because

10:33.041 --> 10:35.358
that's always been
a hobby of mine.

10:35.377 --> 10:37.802
Okay, listen.
I didn't let Phoebe go.

10:37.954 --> 10:39.545
I hid her in a shoebox
in my room and now

10:39.698 --> 10:42.031
I got to feed her since
she can't catch her own food.

10:42.125 --> 10:43.383
Who rescued who, am I right?

10:43.535 --> 10:46.127
Yeah, so, uh, if you help me
catch some bugs,

10:46.146 --> 10:47.312
I'll let you watch
me feed her.

10:47.463 --> 10:48.963
-'Cause she eats live bugs.
-(gags)

10:49.057 --> 10:51.708
I mean, she doesn't
eat live bugs. She does.

10:51.726 --> 10:53.710
-(gags)
-Come on, if you guys

10:53.728 --> 10:55.545
had a secret spider,
I'd help you feed it.

10:55.638 --> 10:57.547
Didn't we always
promise each other that?

10:57.565 --> 10:59.399
I thought it was a secret alien
robot agreement.

10:59.551 --> 11:01.718
I guess that was very specific
to<i> The Iron Giant.</i>

11:01.811 --> 11:03.161
(sighs)
I guess I'll help.

11:03.312 --> 11:05.997
Me too. Flies usually
land on me, eventually.

11:06.074 --> 11:07.648
Hey, Phoebe.
How's it hanging?

11:07.668 --> 11:11.169
You know, like hanging from
your web? Little spider humor.

11:11.320 --> 11:12.912
So, Gene and Tina are here.

11:12.989 --> 11:14.339
-Hi.
-Hello there.

11:14.490 --> 11:15.732
LOUISE:
We caught you
some flies for dinner.

11:15.750 --> 11:18.159
-Tina, want to do the honors?
-Uh, not really?

11:18.253 --> 11:19.493
Also, I don't know
how we're gonna get them

11:19.513 --> 11:21.404
out of the container
without them flying away.

11:21.423 --> 11:23.348
Tell them they won a free night
in a fancy shoebox resort.

11:23.499 --> 11:25.517
But they have to listen to a
presentation about a time-share.

11:25.744 --> 11:27.835
I think we just shake
the container and dump them in.

11:27.929 --> 11:29.095
I'll do it.

11:29.247 --> 11:32.023
Shake, shake, shake.
And bon appétit.

11:32.175 --> 11:34.675
Oh, it looks like she's
wrapping it in a little blanket

11:34.695 --> 11:37.511
to keep it warm.
And, oh, she's giving it a kiss.

11:37.531 --> 11:40.347
-Nope. (gags)
-Does this make us
accomplices to murder?

11:40.367 --> 11:42.942
Now I'll never be able
to run for Congress!

11:43.094 --> 11:44.260
(phone dings)

11:44.353 --> 11:45.895
You've been getting
so many text messages

11:45.897 --> 11:47.354
your little phone's
gonna be sore.

11:47.523 --> 11:49.207
(sighs) I feel like this
is more than I talk to, like,

11:49.434 --> 11:51.692
you guys. But I don't
want to go silent, right?

11:51.712 --> 11:55.046
I'm just gonna say "ha-ha"
and hope that works.

11:55.273 --> 11:56.956
-(phone dings)
-Oh. Teddy's texting me.

11:57.050 --> 11:59.442
He won't be in tomorrow
for lunch because he bought

11:59.535 --> 12:01.535
a bunch of sandwich stuff
and he's gonna

12:01.613 --> 12:03.963
"try this
making sandwiches thing."

12:04.057 --> 12:05.056
He's not gonna
get it right away,

12:05.283 --> 12:06.466
but tell him to stick with it.

12:06.542 --> 12:07.892
-(phone dings)
-Hey. Cliff just invited me

12:08.044 --> 12:09.285
to hang out
with them tonight.

12:09.304 --> 12:10.562
Whoa. That's short notice,
but I think

12:10.713 --> 12:12.213
-I can get you ready.
-(buzzing in distance)

12:12.232 --> 12:13.473
Okay, there's the dryer.
Laundry's done.

12:13.567 --> 12:15.567
Everyone's gets
getting clean sheets tonight.

12:15.794 --> 12:17.310
Won't that be weird? Louise,
I'm gonna start in your room

12:17.462 --> 12:20.071
and you get to help because
of your wonderful loft bed.

12:20.223 --> 12:22.298
That makes
changing sheets so easy.

12:22.391 --> 12:24.317
No, no, no, no, no,
don't go in there. Uh...

12:24.469 --> 12:27.320
I can do it. I want to do it.
I should learn,

12:27.414 --> 12:28.805
in case you and Dad die.

12:28.898 --> 12:30.582
Which you will,
I assume, one day.

12:30.733 --> 12:32.992
Never! We'll get them
to start taking echinacea

12:33.144 --> 12:34.327
and they'll live forever.

12:34.479 --> 12:37.647
Okay, yup...
No, that's not working.

12:37.740 --> 12:39.257
What about...
Nah. Nope.

12:39.484 --> 12:41.334
Yeah. (scoffs)
I'm not doing this.

12:41.486 --> 12:44.153
It'll be fine.
Who needs sheets? Okay,

12:44.322 --> 12:46.431
goodnight, Phoebe...
Oh, no. No, no, no.

12:46.658 --> 12:48.767
Where'd she go? Where'd
she go, where'd she go?

12:48.994 --> 12:51.561
-Uh-oh. Phoebe's missing?
-Smart money says
the flies did it.

12:56.092 --> 12:57.667
Ugh, Phoebe.
Why didn't you stay in the box?

12:57.685 --> 13:00.336
You mean the shoebox
you trapped a wild spider in?

13:00.429 --> 13:02.113
-Yeah, I don't know.
-What's Phoebe's problem?

13:02.265 --> 13:03.782
That's one of the top three
boxes we have.

13:03.933 --> 13:05.784
Okay, she has a belly full of
flies, so she can't be moving

13:05.935 --> 13:08.602
too fast. Hopefully she hasn't
made it to the living room,

13:08.696 --> 13:10.622
'cause Mom and Dad are in there
watching that show

13:10.773 --> 13:12.682
about England.
I think it's called<i> Queen Time.</i>

13:12.775 --> 13:14.292
Yeah, seems like Dad's stalling.

13:14.519 --> 13:15.776
He's nervous about his dad date.

13:15.796 --> 13:17.353
Of course he's nervous.
It's Cliff.

13:17.446 --> 13:19.297
Okay, she's not in here.
Fan out.

13:19.524 --> 13:21.299
Gene, you go that way.
Tina, you go that way.

13:21.526 --> 13:23.284
I'll go this way.
Watch your step.

13:23.303 --> 13:25.136
And if you see her,
let's have a signal.

13:25.288 --> 13:27.030
Say "along came a hmm-hmm."

13:27.198 --> 13:28.698
Ding-dong?
Oh, right. Spider.

13:28.716 --> 13:31.309
So, are you, uh, going out
tonight or what? Or no?

13:31.460 --> 13:32.977
Yeah.
I'll-I'll probably go.

13:33.204 --> 13:35.538
They're-they're out, at a place,
so they're already there.

13:35.557 --> 13:39.392
I can just show up late,
you know? Or-or really late.

13:39.486 --> 13:41.727
Yeah, I'm just gearing up to,
you know, put shoes on

13:41.822 --> 13:44.881
and then I'll pick an outfit.
It's part of my process.

13:44.899 --> 13:46.324
Of hanging out.
With-with friends.

13:46.475 --> 13:47.826
Yeah, sounds like
you do it a lot.

13:47.977 --> 13:49.643
And I think it's fine
you didn't shower.

13:49.663 --> 13:51.737
What? (sniffs)
Oh. Oh, boy.

13:51.832 --> 13:54.481
Yeah, it doesn't matter. They're
dads. They probably smell, too.

13:54.501 --> 13:56.059
Maybe it'll be
a nice icebreaker.

13:56.152 --> 13:57.836
(sniffs)
This one smells really bad.

13:57.987 --> 13:59.504
(sniffs) This one's okay.

13:59.655 --> 14:01.747
Maybe I can just angle my body
this way all night?

14:01.900 --> 14:03.341
-You can start that now.
-Mm.

14:03.492 --> 14:05.492
I'm kidding, I'm kidding.
I'm used to it.

14:05.512 --> 14:07.253
I just try
not to breathe so much.

14:07.347 --> 14:09.739
Ugh. So, we didn't
find her. That means

14:09.757 --> 14:12.183
she's either in the living room
or in Mom and Dad's room.

14:12.335 --> 14:14.168
You guys got to get
Mom and Dad out of there

14:14.187 --> 14:15.912
so I can look for her.
Tina, you take Mom.

14:16.005 --> 14:19.006
Gene, you take Dad. Get 'em into
your rooms and keep 'em there.

14:19.100 --> 14:20.859
Uh, okay. I can do that.
No problem.

14:21.086 --> 14:24.529
I'll just tell Mom
we're looking for a spider?

14:24.756 --> 14:26.923
No, no. Don't tell her that.
Tell her anything but that.

14:26.941 --> 14:28.515
Right, right. Sorry.

14:28.535 --> 14:30.368
I'll tell Dad I want
to have "the talk" with him.

14:30.519 --> 14:32.261
The talk about
my ingrown toenail

14:32.280 --> 14:33.872
and just toe health in general.

14:34.023 --> 14:37.283
Wow, you agreed to come in here
and talk to me really fast.

14:37.435 --> 14:38.935
Well, it's not because I don't
want to go out

14:39.028 --> 14:41.528
with the other dads,
because I definitely do.

14:41.606 --> 14:42.547
Okay, good to know.

14:42.698 --> 14:44.716
So, w-what did you
want to talk about?

14:44.943 --> 14:48.535
Um, how do you feel
about ingrown toenails?

14:48.630 --> 14:50.279
I mean, I have them.

14:50.298 --> 14:52.298
Okay, follow-up question:

14:52.450 --> 14:53.633
-what should we talk about next?
-(phone dings)

14:53.727 --> 14:56.377
(sighs) Uh, I guess
I've put this off long enough.

14:56.396 --> 14:58.379
They're waiting for me
at the bar.

14:58.398 --> 15:01.290
You sound really into it.
I'm excited to grow up.

15:01.309 --> 15:03.643
-I better go get dressed.
-In your room? No!

15:03.795 --> 15:06.237
Uh, I mean, you want to borrow
something of mine?

15:06.464 --> 15:08.055
What kind of look
are you going for--

15:08.149 --> 15:10.241
Bahama Tommy
or rhinestone cowboy?

15:10.410 --> 15:12.443
Oh. I-I wasn't
thinking about a look.

15:12.670 --> 15:15.246
I was just gonna put on shoes
and maybe change my shirt.

15:15.473 --> 15:18.658
Your mother said things that
make me think I should change.

15:18.810 --> 15:21.811
No! Don't change your shirt.
Let me smell. (sniffs)

15:21.813 --> 15:24.589
Ooh, that's bold. It's like
your sweat started sweating.

15:24.782 --> 15:26.315
Ugh, no spider.

15:26.334 --> 15:29.093
All right. Mom and Dad's room.
Maybe Phoebe likes

15:29.320 --> 15:31.578
middle-aged bras
and dandruff all over the place.

15:31.673 --> 15:34.265
So I'm happy we moved over
here to talk about stuff.

15:34.492 --> 15:36.083
Leaning against the bookshelf
was a weird idea,

15:36.177 --> 15:37.769
but it was good we tried.

15:37.996 --> 15:39.162
Yeah, I like to try things.

15:39.180 --> 15:42.331
So, uh, how, uh, was your day?

15:42.350 --> 15:44.350
Eh, it was good.
Although I did have a sneeze

15:44.502 --> 15:46.427
where I farted a little,
and I think a customer heard.

15:46.521 --> 15:48.947
Wow, let's talk about that.
What happened next?

15:49.098 --> 15:50.840
Tina, honey,
didn't you have something

15:50.858 --> 15:52.008
you wanted to talk about?

15:52.026 --> 15:53.434
No, this seems
much more important now.

15:53.453 --> 15:55.861
So, uh, you talk.
More. Please.

15:56.014 --> 15:58.439
Okay. Well, I farted.

15:58.458 --> 15:59.515
Uh-huh.

15:59.701 --> 16:01.350
And I-I tried to
cover it up with a cough,

16:01.369 --> 16:03.628
-but that made me fart again.
-Then what did you do?

16:03.779 --> 16:06.689
I looked over to see if she was
looking at me, and-and she was.

16:06.691 --> 16:09.634
(gasps) Didn't see that coming.
(weak chuckle) Keep-keep going.

16:09.803 --> 16:12.453
So, I grabbed the trash can and
I started dragging it around

16:12.547 --> 16:14.955
on the floor so it'd make a
fart sound, so she'd think

16:15.049 --> 16:17.216
it was the trash can and not me.
But it wouldn't make

16:17.368 --> 16:19.143
the right sound,
so I had to fart again

16:19.220 --> 16:20.627
and then blame it
on the trash can.

16:20.722 --> 16:21.628
That's so smart.

16:21.797 --> 16:23.556
Okay, enough about me.
Your turn.

16:23.708 --> 16:25.650
I don't even know
if I can follow that.

16:25.877 --> 16:29.562
Um, should we take a few more
minutes to unpack your story?

16:29.714 --> 16:33.549
So, there you were, farting and
dragging a trash can around...

16:33.568 --> 16:36.477
Ugh, I give up.
Wherever you are Phoebe,

16:36.496 --> 16:40.665
I hope there are plenty of bugs
for you to murder.

16:41.726 --> 16:43.668
No way.
Phoebe! I found you!

16:43.895 --> 16:45.061
BOB:
Wait, Phoebe?

16:45.154 --> 16:47.246
-Phoebe the spider?
-Oh, hi, Dad.

16:47.398 --> 16:50.717
No, Phoebe from<i> Friends.</i>
I see her everywhere.

16:50.826 --> 16:52.084
-Louise.
-(sighs)

16:52.237 --> 16:54.870
Okay, fine. I kind of
didn't take her outside

16:54.922 --> 16:56.997
and she's been
living in my room in a box.

16:57.017 --> 16:58.574
Until now.
Now she's living

16:58.667 --> 17:00.501
-in your bed.
-Oh, my God.
-LINDA: What?

17:00.520 --> 17:02.912
-What's going on?
-Louise's spider is living
in our headboard.

17:02.930 --> 17:04.080
Who, Phoebe?

17:04.098 --> 17:06.173
-Louise, Mom... is here.
Hi, Mom.

17:06.192 --> 17:07.841
Dad, why won't you let me
brush your back?

17:07.861 --> 17:09.252
The other dads will love it.

17:09.270 --> 17:11.303
Any chance you guys
enjoy sleeping with spiders

17:11.455 --> 17:14.181
over your head? No? Okay.
Phoebe,

17:14.275 --> 17:16.275
<i> Charlotte's Web</i> time.
Spell something fun.

17:16.369 --> 17:18.018
"Terrific parents."
Go.

17:18.038 --> 17:20.163
Give her a second.

17:24.527 --> 17:26.044
Louise, why didn't you take
Phoebe outside yesterday?

17:26.237 --> 17:28.713
I tried, but it wasn't safe
out there. I couldn't do it.

17:28.882 --> 17:32.199
The world's too dangerous for
a fresh-faced kid like Phoebe.

17:32.218 --> 17:33.626
She's not ready
for the bright lights.

17:33.778 --> 17:35.035
She will be. One day.

17:35.055 --> 17:36.721
Louise, sweetie, we're gonna
have to get the spider

17:36.948 --> 17:40.116
out of there somehow. It might
be nice or it might not be nice,

17:40.134 --> 17:42.134
but we got to do it.
I'm sorry, baby.

17:42.287 --> 17:44.395
No, no, no, no. It's okay.
I'll-I'll do it. I-I got it.

17:44.564 --> 17:46.213
It's fine.
I'll get her out of there.

17:46.232 --> 17:47.881
And I'll take her back
to her box,

17:47.901 --> 17:49.475
and we'll all be happy
and we'll eat live flies--

17:49.627 --> 17:51.903
some of us-- and we'll be
this cool blended family

17:52.130 --> 17:53.296
that everybody's jealous of.

17:53.464 --> 17:56.890
Come on, Phoebe. Ugh!
I can't get her.

17:56.910 --> 17:59.151
Oh, we're gonna get her.
Because I sleep

17:59.320 --> 18:00.486
right under there, Louise.

18:00.638 --> 18:02.305
And I know you like her,
but I don't like her

18:02.398 --> 18:03.730
as much as you do.
And I don't want her

18:03.750 --> 18:06.084
to crawl on my face
or go into my mouth.

18:06.311 --> 18:09.161
Or ears, nose, throat--
all the openings.

18:09.314 --> 18:10.588
-That's not all of them.
-Gene.

18:10.815 --> 18:13.649
Okay, uh, what if you guys
just sleep in my room with me

18:13.668 --> 18:15.242
and this is Phoebe's room now?

18:15.303 --> 18:17.336
I'd be open to roommates.
We could split the utilities.

18:17.430 --> 18:19.688
I'm sorry, sweetie,
that's not gonna work.

18:19.748 --> 18:22.600
It's not fair. Everyone thinks
Phoebe is this scary spider.

18:22.751 --> 18:26.437
And, yeah, maybe she's a little
dangerous, but not much.

18:26.589 --> 18:29.273
She's just trying to live
her life. But that doesn't

18:29.425 --> 18:34.186
make her weird or bad.
Does it? I mean, does it?

18:34.339 --> 18:35.446
Are we still talking
about Phoebe?

18:35.673 --> 18:37.857
-I can't tell.
-Louise, are we possibly

18:38.009 --> 18:39.375
talking about you now?

18:39.377 --> 18:41.360
What? I don't know.
Maybe.

18:41.454 --> 18:43.287
Oh, honey.
Come here. Come on.

18:43.439 --> 18:45.606
You know all that
so-called dangerous stuff?

18:45.625 --> 18:47.941
That's a part of who you are.
But don't let anyone

18:48.152 --> 18:49.293
make you feel like
it's all you are.

18:49.445 --> 18:53.113
You're also thoughtful
and kind and imaginative.

18:53.133 --> 18:54.373
Part of the big, crazy mix that

18:54.467 --> 18:56.634
-makes Louise Louise.
-Your mom's right.

18:56.803 --> 18:59.804
You are a little bit of a risk
taker, maybe, compared to some,

18:59.955 --> 19:02.306
but it's one of the things
that makes you interesting.

19:02.533 --> 19:04.049
And it's not like
it's hurting anyone.

19:04.126 --> 19:05.459
I mean, you know,
every once in a while,

19:05.553 --> 19:08.053
but probably not on purpose.
That much.

19:08.148 --> 19:09.555
Right. But, Louise,

19:09.649 --> 19:11.983
you're adventurous,
and in another time,

19:12.134 --> 19:15.153
you might have been
a-a, uh, a pirate.

19:15.321 --> 19:17.730
Uh, a nice pirate.
Or a fun bootlegger.

19:17.824 --> 19:19.064
Ooh, bootlegger.

19:19.159 --> 19:21.642
Anyway, we're all glad
you are who you are.

19:21.736 --> 19:23.552
Well, that's...
Thanks, guys.

19:23.571 --> 19:26.071
I like the pirate part.
That was a nice touch.

19:26.166 --> 19:28.407
So, what should we do
about Phoebe?

19:28.559 --> 19:30.242
Please let this work.
Please let this work.

19:30.336 --> 19:31.894
-Please let this work.
-LOUISE: Got her!

19:32.063 --> 19:33.396
-Oh!
-Oh, thank God.
-TINA and GENE: Yay!

19:33.414 --> 19:35.064
Aw, Bob. It's late.
Are your dad friends

19:35.082 --> 19:36.507
still waiting for you?

19:36.659 --> 19:39.993
Eh, it's fine. I'd rather be
doing this. Honestly, you guys

19:40.087 --> 19:42.847
are the only people I really
like to hang out with.

19:42.998 --> 19:44.256
Don't tell Teddy I said that.

19:44.409 --> 19:47.501
So, we're your only friends.
Which is not sad at all.

19:47.520 --> 19:50.246
But, like, who's your best
friend? Don't say Mom.

19:50.264 --> 19:51.597
You're all equal.
But Phoebe the least.

19:51.749 --> 19:54.099
But just because
I don't know her that well.

19:54.252 --> 19:55.584
Okay, Phoebe and I
are going to bed.

19:55.678 --> 19:58.587
-We'll see you all
upon the morrow.
-Louise.

19:58.681 --> 20:00.531
Not that your box isn't really
nice with all the twigs

20:00.608 --> 20:03.108
and stuff, but I don't think
Phoebe likes it in there.

20:03.261 --> 20:04.593
She did escape.

20:04.612 --> 20:06.929
We've been through this.
I'm not taking her outside.

20:06.948 --> 20:09.207
She's a house spider.
I looked it up.

20:09.434 --> 20:11.242
They gave themselves
that name for a reason.

20:11.394 --> 20:14.119
I-I think I know a place
where she'll be happy.

20:14.214 --> 20:15.546
This is a great idea.

20:15.773 --> 20:17.606
She's gonna eat
so many flies for you, Dad.

20:17.700 --> 20:21.052
Yup. I'm really, really glad
that we'll be working together.

20:21.203 --> 20:23.370
She's not family,
so you might have to pay her.

20:23.464 --> 20:24.780
And I'm kind of taking care
of her finances

20:24.799 --> 20:27.616
while she gets on her feet.
So, you can pay me.

20:27.635 --> 20:30.119
-Yeah sure, okay,
we'll talk about that.
-(phone dings)

20:30.212 --> 20:31.787
Oh, it's Teddy.

20:31.806 --> 20:34.673
He says, "I'm sorry.
The sandwich was a disaster."

20:34.825 --> 20:37.460
There was blood everywhere.
It's okay now, but, uh,

20:37.553 --> 20:39.795
I'm gonna come into
the restaurant tomorrow.

20:39.814 --> 20:41.572
It's just easier to hang out
at the restaurant because

20:41.799 --> 20:44.558
that's where you work.
And it's where I eat.

20:44.635 --> 20:47.745
I know it's late but,
I-I need you to text me back.

20:47.972 --> 20:50.623
Tonight. Now.
And send.

20:52.827 --> 20:54.067
(phone dings)

20:54.087 --> 20:56.921
"Sounds good."
Yes! We're back, baby!

20:57.148 --> 20:59.072
