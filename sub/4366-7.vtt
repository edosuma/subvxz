00:01.830 --> 00:03.320
You are being watched.

00:04.230 --> 00:06.220
The government has a secret system--

00:06.220 --> 00:09.750
a machine that spies on you every hour of every day.

00:10.580 --> 00:12.680
I know because... I built it.

00:13.220 --> 00:15.690
I designed the machine to detect acts of terror

00:15.690 --> 00:16.860
but it sees everything--

00:17.380 --> 00:19.760
Violent crimes involving ordinary people.

00:20.030 --> 00:20.810
People like you.

00:21.660 --> 00:23.840
Crimes the government considered irrelevant.

00:25.400 --> 00:27.680
They wouldn't act, so I decided I would.

00:28.640 --> 00:29.940
But I needed a partner.

00:30.490 --> 00:32.689
Someone with the skills to intervene.

00:33.390 --> 00:37.050
Hunted by the authorities, we work in secret.

00:37.330 --> 00:38.650
You will never find us.

00:38.980 --> 00:42.820
But victim or perpetrator, if your number's up,

00:42.830 --> 00:44.130
we'll find you.

00:51.810 --> 00:55.000
The call came in. We have a location on the target.

00:55.000 --> 00:56.490
Get a team, and I'll meet you there.

00:56.880 --> 00:57.900
We can handle this.

00:57.900 --> 01:00.820
No. I want to be there in person.

01:00.820 --> 01:03.100
I want to kill him myself.

01:05.000 --> 01:11.074

01:17.000 --> 01:18.870
Wait. Can you rewind that for me?

01:20.550 --> 01:22.550
I thought I was all done mopping up bodega shootings

01:22.560 --> 01:24.630
when I joined the homicide task force.

01:24.680 --> 01:26.150
This looks like a stickup job to you?

01:26.150 --> 01:28.590
Then maybe you need to go back to working a precinct.

01:29.670 --> 01:31.150
There was no money taken.

01:31.330 --> 01:34.180
Double tap, close range-- this was an execution.

01:34.960 --> 01:36.560
We got any I.D. on the vic?

01:36.560 --> 01:39.200
Not yet, but you haven't seen the best part.

01:39.200 --> 01:40.660
Rewind it again.

01:42.530 --> 01:44.830
We got ourselves a witness.

01:44.830 --> 01:47.060
- Any sign of him? - I put out a bolo.

01:47.060 --> 01:49.310
Had a team canvass a six-block radius.

01:49.310 --> 01:50.300
Guy vanished.

01:50.300 --> 01:51.710
I'd make myself scarce too.

01:52.140 --> 01:53.940
This ain't no neighborhood you want to be called a snitch.

01:53.940 --> 01:55.380
- No, it's not. - Detective...

01:55.380 --> 01:58.190
Got a bunch of reporters out there begging me for scraps.

01:58.600 --> 01:59.380
What do I tell them?

01:59.380 --> 02:01.240
Send them to the task force P.R. guy.

02:01.240 --> 02:02.710
- Let him deal with them. - Yes, ma'am.

02:03.460 --> 02:05.340
Detective Szymanski, organized crime,

02:05.340 --> 02:07.350
- This is detective Fusco. - Nice to meet you.

02:07.350 --> 02:08.850
Was this a mob hit?

02:08.850 --> 02:11.120
The victim's a former "la cosa nostra" lieutenant

02:11.120 --> 02:13.230
By the name of Benny d'Agostino.

02:13.760 --> 02:14.890
He was out of the game for a couple of years,

02:14.890 --> 02:17.990
and then he popped up again on our radar about six months ago.

02:17.990 --> 02:19.590
Brighton beach is Russian territory.

02:19.590 --> 02:21.060
So what's the l.C.N. doing here?

02:21.060 --> 02:23.190
You kidding? There's a war going on.

02:23.200 --> 02:25.060
Half a dozen V.I.P.S. in the Russian mob

02:25.060 --> 02:26.230
were taken out last month.

02:26.230 --> 02:28.630
Word is Benny's boss ordered the hits.

02:28.630 --> 02:31.000
- This was retribution. - So who's his boss?

02:31.000 --> 02:32.000
We don't know much...

02:32.000 --> 02:35.290
Other than a name-- Elias.

02:36.660 --> 02:37.640
You heard of him?

02:37.640 --> 02:39.380
Oh, yeah. We go way back.

02:39.380 --> 02:41.280
One of his guys took a shot at me last week.

02:41.280 --> 02:43.380
This Elias is a clever bastard.

02:43.380 --> 02:45.080
Nobody even knows what he looks like.

02:45.080 --> 02:46.080
What about the witness?

02:46.090 --> 02:47.650
Your boys have any luck finding him?

02:47.650 --> 02:50.470
No, but have another look at the surveillance footage.

02:55.590 --> 02:57.900
The victim said something to the witness.

02:57.900 --> 03:00.530
If it's a dying declaration and he named the killers,

03:00.530 --> 03:01.530
it'd be admissible.

03:01.530 --> 03:03.800
Yeah, but we've got a problem.

03:03.800 --> 03:06.070
The Russian owner of this fine establishment

03:06.070 --> 03:08.770
was on a conveniently timed smoke break

03:08.770 --> 03:10.410
when all this went down.

03:10.410 --> 03:11.740
He's not giving us anything.

03:11.740 --> 03:13.950
You think he told the shooters we found a witness?

03:13.950 --> 03:15.710
If he did, the Russians will knock down every door

03:15.720 --> 03:17.750
in this neighborhood till they find him.

03:17.750 --> 03:19.380
Well, my guys are working the block.

03:19.390 --> 03:21.790
- Something will pop. - It better.

03:21.790 --> 03:25.300
We got to get to this witness before the Russians do.

03:30.860 --> 03:32.260
I received his number late last night.

03:32.260 --> 03:34.500
His name is Charlie Burton.

03:34.500 --> 03:36.350
The guy is worried about something.

03:37.270 --> 03:38.600
I'm not seeing a threat yet.

03:38.600 --> 03:40.670
What's his story, Finch?

03:40.670 --> 03:42.270
He's a high-school history teacher

03:42.270 --> 03:43.640
working in the Brighton Beach school district.

03:43.640 --> 03:45.980
Lives alone, never married--

03:45.980 --> 03:47.150
not much to go on.

03:47.150 --> 03:49.650
Well, maybe a student's after him.

03:49.650 --> 03:52.080
You know, teaching can be a dangerous profession.

03:52.080 --> 03:54.790
Yes, I imagine espionage was a much safer choice,

03:54.790 --> 03:56.570
Mr. Reese.

04:02.960 --> 04:04.260
Hello, Lionel.

04:04.260 --> 04:05.960
I'm not sure how you usually do what you do,

04:05.970 --> 04:08.530
But I'm looking for a guy, and I could use some help.

04:08.530 --> 04:10.970
He's a witness, saw a Russian mob hit go down.

04:10.970 --> 04:14.270
He's caucasian, 5'10", bald.

04:14.270 --> 04:16.410
Probably not the most popular guy in his class,

04:16.410 --> 04:17.480
If you know what I mean.

04:17.480 --> 04:18.760
We need to find him.

04:19.839 --> 04:21.450
I think I already did.

04:21.450 --> 04:23.150
Why am I not surprised?

04:23.150 --> 04:25.580
Listen, whoever did this hit,

04:25.580 --> 04:28.170
They're gonna come looking for him.

04:29.820 --> 04:32.460
They've already found him.

04:32.460 --> 04:34.160
Mr. Reese...

04:34.160 --> 04:36.330
We might want to leave this one to the authorities.

04:36.330 --> 04:38.680
No time. I'm heading in.

04:44.140 --> 04:45.640
Cover the exits.

04:45.640 --> 04:48.290
The rest of you come with me.

05:12.260 --> 05:13.830
Get out of my apartment.

05:13.830 --> 05:15.850
Mr. Burton, you're in danger.

05:15.950 --> 05:17.940
The men from the bodega are here.

05:17.940 --> 05:19.870
Now, how do you know about that? Did they send you?

05:19.870 --> 05:21.940
Sir, you have a Russian hit team closing in,

05:21.940 --> 05:24.410
Which leaves us with approximately five seconds

05:24.410 --> 05:26.240
before you need to make a decision.

05:26.250 --> 05:27.580
How do I know you're not one of them?

05:27.580 --> 05:29.380
Because I'm standing in front of you

05:29.380 --> 05:31.210
And you're still alive.

05:33.590 --> 05:35.630
Doesn't seem like I've got a choice.

05:57.240 --> 05:59.480
Where did this piece of garbage go?

05:59.480 --> 06:00.960
I'll double back.

06:01.710 --> 06:03.210
Mr. Reese, can you get out?

06:03.220 --> 06:05.450
Do you need me to call in a distraction?

06:05.450 --> 06:07.660
Let me get back to you on that. Come on.

06:26.110 --> 06:27.630
Let's get moving...

06:28.140 --> 06:29.290
Now.

06:36.380 --> 06:38.280
Okay, the fastest way out of this neighborhood

06:38.280 --> 06:39.680
is through those buildings.

06:39.690 --> 06:41.090
What, are you joking?

06:41.090 --> 06:43.150
Even the Russians don't go into the Double "B"s.

06:43.160 --> 06:45.020
A bulgarian drug dealer runs the place.

06:45.020 --> 06:49.840
Okay, Finch, I'm gonna need another route out of here.

06:51.300 --> 06:54.300
We're on our own. I need your cell phone.

06:54.300 --> 06:56.750
I don't believe in them.

06:59.890 --> 07:00.750
Mr. Reese, can you hear me?

07:10.150 --> 07:12.620
Hey, this isn't mine!

07:12.620 --> 07:15.370
Not mine either. Get in.

07:18.620 --> 07:19.920
May I at least have your name

07:19.930 --> 07:21.660
Before we commit grand theft auto together?

07:21.660 --> 07:23.230
First, we need to get you to the police,

07:23.230 --> 07:25.360
So you can tell them about what you saw at the bodega.

07:25.360 --> 07:26.760
The Russian mob is after me, friend.

07:26.770 --> 07:28.170
They've got people on the inside.

07:28.170 --> 07:29.670
If I testify, I'm dead.

07:29.670 --> 07:31.700
I know a detective we can trust.

07:31.700 --> 07:33.940
But we need to get you across the river to Manhattan.

07:33.940 --> 07:35.720
Get down!

07:44.650 --> 07:46.320
We need to keep moving.

07:46.320 --> 07:48.050
That's going to be a problem.

07:48.050 --> 07:49.550
You say the Russians don't go in there?

07:49.560 --> 07:51.500
Well, that's where we're going.

08:28.250 --> 08:30.880
See what I mean?

08:56.690 --> 08:58.110
This is crazy.

08:59.760 --> 09:01.630
I still don't even know who you are.

09:01.630 --> 09:03.000
I help people.

09:03.000 --> 09:04.430
And you need help.

09:06.000 --> 09:08.070
Well...

09:08.070 --> 09:10.210
Bullet went straight through clean--

09:10.210 --> 09:13.040
No bone damage.

09:13.040 --> 09:15.780
But we need to get you cleaned up before it gets infected.

09:15.780 --> 09:17.170
You see a pharmacy nearby?

09:19.120 --> 09:22.790
The men you saw last night at the bodega...

09:22.790 --> 09:24.170
what can you tell me about them?

09:29.130 --> 09:30.450
What difference does it make?

09:30.460 --> 09:32.520
I guess I like to know a little bit about the guys

09:32.520 --> 09:33.670
who are shooting at me.

09:36.730 --> 09:40.000
I worked through dinner, and I was grading papers.

09:40.000 --> 09:43.370
And I stopped at the store on my way home.

09:43.370 --> 09:47.220
I couldn't decide between minestrone and split pea.

09:48.440 --> 09:52.510
And then I saw the guys with guns, and I hid.

09:52.510 --> 09:53.950
Did you see their faces?

09:53.950 --> 09:56.830
They had masks.

09:57.040 --> 09:58.320
But one of them lifted his,

09:58.320 --> 10:00.580
like he wanted that guy to see his face.

10:00.590 --> 10:02.950
But that guy they killed...

10:02.960 --> 10:05.890
He said he had a message for someone named Elias.

10:05.890 --> 10:08.830
And he wanted me to give it to him, but I don't know an Elias.

10:08.830 --> 10:10.470
I tried to tell him that.

10:14.450 --> 10:17.800
Mr. Burton, what was the message?

10:17.800 --> 10:21.440
I didn't understand it-- something about Vinnie.

10:21.440 --> 10:24.050
Vinnie was gonna finish the job for him.

10:24.380 --> 10:25.970
Why didn't you call the police?

10:27.980 --> 10:29.640
You don't understand this neighborhood, do you?

10:29.650 --> 10:31.950
Going to the cops here is like playing Russian roulette.

10:31.950 --> 10:35.120
You don't know which side they're on.

10:35.120 --> 10:38.520
One of my students' parents filed a police report last year.

10:38.520 --> 10:41.160
Then he got into an accident.

10:41.160 --> 10:43.860
He's still eating through a straw.

10:43.860 --> 10:46.160
I'll get you to a police officer you can trust.

10:46.160 --> 10:49.730
I'm gonna keep my mouth shut

10:49.730 --> 10:52.030
and hope it all blows over.

10:52.030 --> 10:54.700
I don't know. These guys look pretty upset.

10:54.700 --> 10:56.870
If I testify...

10:56.870 --> 10:59.870
I never get to come back here.

10:59.880 --> 11:01.570
And I've worked too hard.

11:03.150 --> 11:05.190
This is my home.

11:07.050 --> 11:09.180
My students, for starters-- I-I can't leave them.

11:09.180 --> 11:10.380
They need me.

11:10.390 --> 11:12.690
Well, you won't do those kids any good

11:12.690 --> 11:14.530
if you're dead, Mr. Burton.

11:15.920 --> 11:18.960
Charlie, please-- "Mr. Burton" Is for my students.

11:18.960 --> 11:21.430
Do you want to die, Charlie?

11:21.430 --> 11:23.600
Because this isn't a history lesson.

11:23.600 --> 11:26.080
Those bullets are real.

11:30.300 --> 11:33.050
My name is John.

11:35.440 --> 11:38.690
Thank you for saving my ass, John.

11:47.920 --> 11:49.810
Thanks for coming down, Patti.

11:50.790 --> 11:54.400
We're all very sorry for your loss.

11:54.400 --> 11:57.530
You're not sorry. You hated my husband.

11:57.530 --> 11:59.770
No, I only hated what he did for a living.

11:59.770 --> 12:01.400
Ma'am...

12:01.400 --> 12:05.110
Do you know why Benny was in Brighton Beach last night?

12:05.110 --> 12:07.620
Was he--I don't know-- conducting business?

12:08.780 --> 12:11.950
Mrs. D'agostino...

12:11.950 --> 12:15.220
I know that anger you're feeling right now--

12:15.220 --> 12:18.620
What it's like to lose someone you love.

12:18.620 --> 12:21.560
Help us find the men who did this to your husband.

12:21.560 --> 12:24.690
It doesn't matter if you find them.

12:24.690 --> 12:26.590
Elias will.

12:26.600 --> 12:30.660
And he'll kill each and every single one of those russian bastards.

12:30.670 --> 12:34.600
Elias started a war that can't be won.

12:34.600 --> 12:37.770
Now, a lot of innocent people are gonna die if this continues.

12:37.770 --> 12:40.610
- Do you want that? - If that's what it takes.

12:40.610 --> 12:44.150
Where is he, Patti?

12:44.150 --> 12:46.850
Where is Elias?

12:46.850 --> 12:48.880
I never met him.

12:48.880 --> 12:52.650
And his crew... they don't socialize.

12:52.650 --> 12:55.420
That's why you'll never find him.

12:55.420 --> 12:57.560
I'm a little confused.

12:57.560 --> 12:59.430
Why does Elias want Brighton Beach so bad?

12:59.430 --> 13:01.800
You're not seeing it.

13:01.800 --> 13:04.330
Brighton Beach is just the beginning.

13:04.330 --> 13:06.200
Elias has bigger plans.

13:06.200 --> 13:08.370
He'll reunite the five families

13:08.370 --> 13:11.710
and take out the Russian trash.

13:11.710 --> 13:14.010
And then when he's finished,

13:14.010 --> 13:17.860
you people will be answering to him.

14:06.840 --> 14:09.200
Five or six heavily armed men were chasing a guy

14:09.200 --> 14:10.530
matching the description of our witness.

14:10.530 --> 14:12.900
His name's Charlie Burton, by the way.

14:12.900 --> 14:16.600
Found out he had groceries delivered twice a month from the bodega,

14:16.610 --> 14:18.770
And he wasn't dodging bullets by himself.

14:18.770 --> 14:21.240
- Who was he with? - Some tall guy in a suit--

14:21.240 --> 14:22.610
Definitely not with the Russians.

14:22.610 --> 14:25.510
Shot one of them in the knee before they got away.

14:25.510 --> 14:27.050
What? You know him?

14:27.050 --> 14:29.580
It's just someone I've been tracking for a while.

14:29.580 --> 14:31.620
Best I've got, he's former military--

14:31.620 --> 14:32.950
a pain in the ass.

14:32.950 --> 14:34.120
Either one of them get hit?

14:34.120 --> 14:35.690
There seems to be an awful lot of shots fired.

14:35.690 --> 14:37.260
Looks like they got off okay.

14:37.260 --> 14:39.230
I got a russian thug in the hospital who isn't talking,

14:39.230 --> 14:41.430
But we got an ATM camera across the street.

14:41.430 --> 14:43.700
That might help shed some light on things.

14:43.700 --> 14:45.900
It'll take two weeks and a warrant to get the footage.

14:45.900 --> 14:48.580
Thankfully, a bystander got some footage of her own.

14:49.460 --> 14:51.140
Meet Peter Yogorov.

14:51.140 --> 14:53.440
As in Ivan Yogorov, the Russian boss?

14:53.440 --> 14:54.610
Peter's his son.

14:54.610 --> 14:56.840
- Yo, officer. - Yeah.

14:56.850 --> 14:58.280
Call over to the 8th.

14:58.280 --> 15:02.420
Tell them to pull any file we have pertaining to Ivan Yogorov.

15:02.420 --> 15:04.080
Ivan Yogorov-- got it.

15:20.510 --> 15:22.250
Where are you, Mr. Reese?

15:42.520 --> 15:43.780
Who are these guys?

15:50.970 --> 15:53.260
And what's this cop doing with them?

15:58.970 --> 16:01.090
N.Y.P.D.

16:09.460 --> 16:11.750
-Detective Fusco. - Hello, Detective.

16:11.750 --> 16:14.190
I need to talk to you about our mutual friend.

16:14.190 --> 16:15.920
Who's this?

16:15.920 --> 16:17.520
And who the hell is our mutual friend?

16:17.530 --> 16:22.600
I seem to recall you were going to take him to oyster bay once upon a time.

16:22.600 --> 16:23.760
So you're his guy?

16:23.770 --> 16:25.830
No, Detective. I think that's your role.

16:25.830 --> 16:28.140
I've lost contact with him.

16:28.140 --> 16:30.270
Do you have any idea where he and the witness are now?

16:30.270 --> 16:31.840
Yeah, somewhere in Brighton Beach.

16:31.840 --> 16:34.610
The Russians opened fire on them in broad daylight.

16:34.610 --> 16:37.140
Those two are going nowhere fast with this type of heat on them.

16:37.150 --> 16:38.710
Unfortunately, the Russian mafia

16:38.710 --> 16:40.210
May not be our only problem.

16:40.220 --> 16:42.320
I need you to run a license plate for me.

16:42.320 --> 16:45.620
Yeah, sure, pal. I'll help you out...

16:45.620 --> 16:47.690
If you can tell me what the hell it is I'm doing.

16:47.690 --> 16:50.160
It relates to your case. That's all you need to know.

16:50.160 --> 16:53.930
"Tnf0818."

16:53.930 --> 16:55.730
If I hear anything about our friend,

16:55.730 --> 16:56.900
How do I get in touch with you?

16:56.900 --> 17:00.270
You don't. I'll find you, detective.

17:00.270 --> 17:01.900
I'm telling you, I winged the guy.

17:01.900 --> 17:03.400
Let's get in there and finish him off.

17:03.410 --> 17:06.069
Laszlo, wait up. We need to call papa, regroup.

17:06.069 --> 17:08.079
You want to wait around out here?

17:08.079 --> 17:09.410
Fine. I'm going in.

17:09.910 --> 17:12.150
You want to go at it with a bunch of Bulgarian tweakers?

17:12.150 --> 17:13.450
We made a deal--

17:13.450 --> 17:16.430
They stay out of our territory. We stay out of theirs.

17:19.099 --> 17:20.750
Cover every exit.

17:20.760 --> 17:24.540
No way those two get out without going past us first.

17:29.260 --> 17:32.270
I need you to stay awake, charlie.

17:32.270 --> 17:35.510
I don't want you to go into shock.

17:40.940 --> 17:44.410
So how did you wind up doing whatever it is you do, john?

17:44.410 --> 17:47.730
It's... Complicated.

17:48.780 --> 17:50.430
What about you?

17:51.790 --> 17:54.090
Did you always want to be a teacher?

17:54.090 --> 17:57.470
No, it was sort of a career shift.

17:59.370 --> 18:01.330
I came to like the kids a lot.

18:01.330 --> 18:03.860
A lot of their parents are affiliated with the russian mob,

18:03.870 --> 18:06.900
So I try to give them other options.

18:06.900 --> 18:08.980
They're lucky to have you.

18:10.270 --> 18:14.410
Only the ones that I get out of the life and into college.

18:14.410 --> 18:17.240
What about the kids who don't make it?

18:17.250 --> 18:19.630
Probably the ones shooting at us.

18:23.450 --> 18:25.690
Don't go anywhere.

18:25.690 --> 18:28.760
What? Wait. Where--where are you going?

18:28.760 --> 18:31.340
To find us a pharmacy.

18:43.100 --> 18:44.510
You should be careful

18:44.510 --> 18:47.010
About your cholesterol intake, detective.

18:47.010 --> 18:48.220
What, are we dating?

18:49.580 --> 18:52.610
Do you have the information I asked you for?

18:52.610 --> 18:53.910
You're the boss, huh?

18:53.920 --> 18:55.730
The voice on the other end of the phone?

18:57.020 --> 18:58.820
The plate's registered to a shell corp in midtown.

18:58.820 --> 19:00.290
It's a dead end.

19:01.720 --> 19:03.420
Hey, let me ask you something.

19:03.420 --> 19:05.790
Who are you trying to track down, "Mr. Friend of a friend"?

19:05.790 --> 19:08.160
The russians aren't the only criminal operation

19:08.160 --> 19:09.530
Looking for charlie burton.

19:09.530 --> 19:10.900
You saying this plate belongs to Elias?

19:10.900 --> 19:13.330
Maybe. You mentioned in your report

19:13.330 --> 19:15.900
That the victim spoke to mr. Burton before he expired.

19:15.900 --> 19:17.400
Whoa. What do you mean? You read my report?

19:17.410 --> 19:19.470
- How did you read my report? - doesn't matter, mr. Fusco.

19:19.470 --> 19:23.380
What matters is that whatever message benny was passing along,

19:23.380 --> 19:25.590
It means a great deal to elias.

19:26.210 --> 19:28.250
so you're telling me the russians want

19:28.250 --> 19:30.630
The poor bastard dead because he witnessed them taking out benny.

19:30.850 --> 19:31.720
And elias wants him dead

19:31.720 --> 19:33.700
Because he thinks he has sensitive information.

19:34.030 --> 19:36.820
- Not his lucky day, is it? - indeed.

19:36.830 --> 19:39.590
That car-- I need you to report it stolen,

19:39.590 --> 19:42.650
Then email the report number to that address.

19:43.930 --> 19:46.470
Hey, you heard from our mutual friend?

19:46.470 --> 19:48.900
What, are you worried about him, detective?

19:48.900 --> 19:50.400
Let's go with curious.

19:50.410 --> 19:51.720
No.

19:52.770 --> 19:54.270
No word from him.

20:00.450 --> 20:02.350
I made almost twice what I did yesterday.

20:02.350 --> 20:03.880
You still ain't made more than me.

20:03.890 --> 20:07.630
Hello, fellas. Can I borrow some of your drugs?

20:10.460 --> 20:13.730
oh, no. Easy, fella. I'm not looking for a fight.

20:13.730 --> 20:16.380
Looks like you found one anyway.

20:23.130 --> 20:23.940
Don't do it.

20:23.940 --> 20:25.950
I'm telling you, now.

20:40.320 --> 20:42.570
Thank you.

20:51.210 --> 20:53.610
If ivan's sons are involved in this,

20:53.610 --> 20:56.210
Could be the man himself was at the bodega--

20:56.480 --> 20:58.850
Avenge his brother's death in person.

20:58.850 --> 21:01.280
Elias' crew took him out last week,

21:01.280 --> 21:03.520
Along with a half a dozen other russian hitters.

21:03.520 --> 21:05.960
I thought the russians were untouchable in brighton beach.

21:05.960 --> 21:09.530
They were. No one knows where elias gets his information.

21:09.530 --> 21:11.860
He's always one step ahead of all of them...and us.

21:11.860 --> 21:14.700
What I still don't get is why elias

21:14.700 --> 21:16.980
Is trying to make a move for brighton beach.

21:19.470 --> 21:23.070
A woman named Marlene Elias was murdered in 1973.

21:23.070 --> 21:25.340
She had an illegitimate son with Don Moretti.

21:25.340 --> 21:28.690
I think Elias is the Don's kid.

21:30.280 --> 21:31.650
Last place Moretti ran

21:31.650 --> 21:34.680
Before he got locked up was Brighton Beach.

21:34.680 --> 21:37.450
So the Don's bastard son came back to clean up?

21:37.450 --> 21:39.630
Claim his birthright?

21:45.060 --> 21:47.300
What is that?

21:47.300 --> 21:50.530
Cocaine.

21:50.530 --> 21:53.050
I guess there's a first time for everything.

21:55.210 --> 21:56.610
Is that glue?

21:56.610 --> 21:58.540
Yeah.

21:58.540 --> 22:00.310
Nothing like over-the-counter polymer

22:00.310 --> 22:01.940
To close a wound in a pinch.

22:01.950 --> 22:04.280
You learn all this in hero training?

22:04.280 --> 22:06.920
Something like that.

22:06.920 --> 22:08.960
Thank you.

22:11.950 --> 22:14.320
Sure.

22:14.320 --> 22:16.730
No, really...

22:16.730 --> 22:19.060
Thank you.

22:19.060 --> 22:22.310
If it wasn't for you, I'd be dead right now.

22:30.270 --> 22:31.670
You ever use one of these?

22:31.680 --> 22:34.240
Don't you think it would be better if you kept it?

22:34.240 --> 22:36.350
Well, just in case.

22:36.350 --> 22:38.480
No, last time I touched a gun, I shot cans

22:38.480 --> 22:40.880
With one of my foster dads...

22:40.880 --> 22:42.050
Accidentally killed a bird--

22:42.050 --> 22:43.990
Not my favorite childhood memory.

22:43.990 --> 22:46.320
Simple. Look...

22:46.320 --> 22:50.230
Safety's there. Just load the magazine like this.

22:50.230 --> 22:53.570
Rack it. Simple.

22:58.030 --> 23:00.300
Do you really think we'll get out of here?

23:00.300 --> 23:02.240
We have a hell of a lot better chance

23:02.240 --> 23:04.690
Than we did 20 minutes ago.

23:05.840 --> 23:08.090
Here they come.

23:13.180 --> 23:15.220
You after those boys running around our building?

23:15.220 --> 23:16.620
That's right.

23:16.620 --> 23:19.560
He took something from my people.

23:19.560 --> 23:22.120
We don't give you any problems, you take 'em out?

23:22.130 --> 23:25.070
I can make that deal.

23:30.870 --> 23:32.370
Give one to the other guy.

23:32.370 --> 23:33.970
We'll help you out a whole lot quicker.

23:33.970 --> 23:36.410
Someone told me they're hiding out on the fourth floor.

23:36.410 --> 23:40.050
And one of them's already bleeding.

23:50.720 --> 23:53.020
Put this on.

23:53.020 --> 23:56.490
If I can find a line that's still operating,

23:56.490 --> 23:59.240
We can make a call.

24:04.670 --> 24:08.170
Wow, I thought I was the only one who still had a hard line.

24:08.170 --> 24:10.210
I was hoping there was someone in this building

24:10.210 --> 24:14.010
As old-fashioned as you, Charlie.

24:14.010 --> 24:16.410
I'm sorry I got you into this mess.

24:16.410 --> 24:19.720
It's okay. It's my job.

24:19.720 --> 24:22.720
It's a dangerous career choice.

24:22.720 --> 24:26.590
That's the second time today I've heard that.

24:26.590 --> 24:31.170
It's funny. You remind me of him.

24:44.690 --> 24:49.080
Finch... I was just talking about you.

24:49.080 --> 24:50.630
Where are you, Mr. Reese?

24:52.380 --> 24:54.780
The double "B" Housing projects--

24:54.780 --> 24:57.490
Fourth floor, north tower.

24:57.490 --> 24:59.120
Find me a way out of here, Finch--

24:59.120 --> 25:01.620
One that no one else will use.

25:01.620 --> 25:04.140
City planning office should have old blueprints.

25:05.990 --> 25:07.560
How is Mr. Burton faring?

25:07.560 --> 25:10.510
He's wounded but stubborn.

25:11.390 --> 25:12.330
He'll pull through.

25:12.340 --> 25:15.070
The Russians aren't the only ones after him.

25:15.070 --> 25:19.010
I think Elias is looking for him too.

25:19.010 --> 25:20.340
Two service entrances--

25:20.340 --> 25:24.130
The one closest to you is in the northeast corridor.

25:26.580 --> 25:29.790
- Can you make it there?  - We've got no choice.

25:29.790 --> 25:32.920
Tell Fusco to meet us at pier 11 at 7:00 A.M.

25:32.920 --> 25:35.160
We'll be on the East River Ferry.

25:35.160 --> 25:37.760
Be careful, Mr. Reese.

25:37.760 --> 25:39.810
Come on.

25:42.660 --> 25:45.470
Service stairs should be around the next corridor.

25:45.470 --> 25:48.800
Keep your eyes open. They could be anywhere.

25:48.810 --> 25:51.110
Hey, I think they went this way.

25:51.110 --> 25:54.390
- What now? - Wait here.

25:55.910 --> 25:58.230
Who's there?

26:03.650 --> 26:06.070
Check down that way.

26:08.290 --> 26:11.990
- Mr. Burton?  - Will?

26:12.000 --> 26:14.530
What are you doing?

26:14.530 --> 26:16.830
Hey, Will.

26:16.830 --> 26:19.900
Came in looking for a shortcut, and we just, uh...

26:19.900 --> 26:22.340
This is my friend, by the way.

26:22.340 --> 26:23.710
We just got lost.

26:23.710 --> 26:25.740
Check the south side.

26:25.740 --> 26:28.610
Come on. My dad's not home.

26:28.610 --> 26:31.490
You can hide in here.

26:58.170 --> 26:59.940
Vehicle Recovery Services.

26:59.940 --> 27:03.750
Yeah, this is Detective Fusco, shield number 7645.

27:03.750 --> 27:06.880
I'm trying to turn on the locator in a stolen vehicle.

27:06.880 --> 27:09.490
Uh, report number is...

27:09.490 --> 27:11.990
Lima 377.

27:11.990 --> 27:14.820
Thank you, Detective. How can I help you?

27:14.820 --> 27:18.130
Yeah, could you turn on the car's G.P.S. Locator

27:18.130 --> 27:19.530
And the microphone?

27:19.530 --> 27:22.080
Of course. Bear with me, please.

27:27.600 --> 27:29.540
I thought you and your dad moved out of here.

27:29.540 --> 27:32.450
Not yet. He said we will as soon as he gets a job.

27:32.920 --> 27:34.940
Yeah, times are tough right now.

27:34.940 --> 27:36.850
I'm sure he'll get one soon.

27:36.850 --> 27:40.060
Just don't move out of my school district, okay?

27:41.950 --> 27:45.500
- You did your homework? - Yep. All of it.

27:47.360 --> 27:50.090
- What did you think? - Edmond's cool--

27:50.090 --> 27:51.960
A survivor, you know?

27:51.960 --> 27:53.230
Even though he got his revenge,

27:53.230 --> 27:54.680
Some bad stuff still stuck with him.

27:55.230 --> 27:57.470
Yeah, you're a smart kid, Will.

27:57.470 --> 28:00.140
You just need to show up to class more.

28:00.140 --> 28:01.340
I'm trying.

28:01.340 --> 28:03.650
That's all any of us can do, right?

28:05.810 --> 28:07.310
Zombies?

28:07.310 --> 28:08.570
They're taking over the universe.

28:08.570 --> 28:10.890
Yeah, can't have that.

28:27.890 --> 28:29.610
Who are you?

28:32.800 --> 28:35.380
You're that cop.

28:37.840 --> 28:41.270
Word is the Russians are inside the double "B"s.

28:41.270 --> 28:42.920
We better get to them first.

28:59.470 --> 29:01.670
Is that you, Elias?

29:24.440 --> 29:26.450
Open up, or we're coming in.

29:35.350 --> 29:36.450
What do you want?

29:36.450 --> 29:38.720
Hey, little man. You all alone in there?

29:38.720 --> 29:40.120
What's it look like?

29:40.120 --> 29:44.320
Why don't you let me in, so I can make sure?

29:44.320 --> 29:46.090
My papa taught me better

29:46.090 --> 29:48.260
Than to let strangers inside our place,

29:48.260 --> 29:49.970
Especially punks.

29:53.070 --> 29:55.120
- Is that right? - That's right.

29:55.120 --> 29:58.240
He also said that vory are supposed to show respect

29:58.240 --> 29:59.570
To one another.

30:02.070 --> 30:03.750
Your papa's a smart man.

30:06.080 --> 30:07.500
You be good, kid.

30:16.760 --> 30:17.820
Thanks, Will.

30:17.820 --> 30:19.100
It's all good, Mr. Burton.

30:19.300 --> 30:20.590
You're the best teacher I've got.

30:25.530 --> 30:26.930
Charlie...

30:29.180 --> 30:30.710
Can you make it to the service stairs?

30:30.710 --> 30:35.010
I'll try, but the painkiller sort of wore off.

30:35.010 --> 30:37.180
Why don't you just use the old entrance?

30:37.180 --> 30:39.010
They closed it down a few years ago.

30:39.020 --> 30:41.250
- The stairs got all rotted. - Where is it?

30:41.250 --> 30:43.350
It's--it's down the hall.

30:43.350 --> 30:44.990
It's back the way that you came.

30:46.020 --> 30:48.240
Thanks.

30:48.490 --> 30:49.380
Come on.

30:56.660 --> 30:57.430
I owe you one.

30:57.430 --> 30:59.570
I'll see you tomorrow, Mr. Burton.

30:59.570 --> 31:01.540
Yeah. Yeah, we'll see you tomorrow.

31:01.540 --> 31:03.690
You... did you guys get that hallway?

31:03.690 --> 31:05.140
Let's go.

31:17.720 --> 31:20.970
Open up, or we're coming in.

31:26.160 --> 31:28.560
Hello?

31:28.560 --> 31:30.270
Anyone home?

31:32.120 --> 31:33.870
Can't hide forever.

31:35.160 --> 31:36.890
Wherever you are, we're gonna find you.

31:37.200 --> 31:38.720
And then we're gonna end you.

31:40.020 --> 31:41.360
Come on. Let's keep moving.

31:57.900 --> 32:00.390
Looks like you got left behind.

32:04.400 --> 32:05.470
How can I help

32:05.470 --> 32:07.370
The New York City Police Department tonight?

32:07.380 --> 32:08.880
Your son Peter's wanted for questioning

32:08.880 --> 32:10.940
In the murder of Benny D'Agostino.

32:10.950 --> 32:12.650
Know where we might find him?

32:12.650 --> 32:15.120
- Who is this Benny? - Come on, Ivan.

32:15.120 --> 32:16.820
We heard Benny was the trigger man

32:16.820 --> 32:18.150
In your brother's murder.

32:18.150 --> 32:19.790
And we know the Bodega run was payback.

32:19.790 --> 32:20.990
You seem to know a lot

32:20.990 --> 32:24.160
For someone who is here to ask me questions.

32:24.160 --> 32:27.360
Mr. Yogorov, we don't want any more bloodshed.

32:27.360 --> 32:30.900
My Peter was here working all day long.

32:30.900 --> 32:33.630
He's at the storage getting more wine

32:33.640 --> 32:36.640
For an event tonight.

32:36.640 --> 32:38.570
With all due respect, Sir,

32:38.570 --> 32:42.510
You may not be the best person to give your son an alibi.

32:42.510 --> 32:45.380
If you are here to accuse my Peter of something,

32:45.380 --> 32:48.250
I suggest you come back with a warrant...

32:48.250 --> 32:50.050
If you can get one.

32:50.050 --> 32:52.450
There are no winners in this war, Ivan--

32:52.450 --> 32:54.350
Only dead soldiers.

32:54.360 --> 32:57.270
Are you ready to lose your sons too?

32:58.790 --> 33:00.830
If I knew to what you were referring,

33:00.830 --> 33:03.200
I'd say that this so-called war

33:03.200 --> 33:06.430
Was started by this coward Elias, not me.

33:06.430 --> 33:09.200
He's the one who comes to my neighborhood...

33:09.200 --> 33:13.610
Stealing from me, killing my people...

33:13.610 --> 33:16.220
Not the other way around.

33:17.790 --> 33:21.730
Now, if you excuse me, I have an event to host.

33:24.490 --> 33:26.900
Please.

33:37.200 --> 33:39.000
Mind if I borrow this for a moment?

33:39.000 --> 33:40.850
Screw you.

33:41.260 --> 33:45.040
It's a bad move to insult your hostage taker, Laszlo.

33:45.040 --> 33:47.870
Keep your mouth shut, or I'll shut it permanently.

33:47.880 --> 33:50.480
Let's go.

33:50.480 --> 33:52.510
Finch, it's me.

33:52.510 --> 33:54.780
Get word to Carter that her bodega shooters

33:54.780 --> 33:56.480
are inside the Double"B"s.

33:56.480 --> 33:58.230
Of course.

33:58.800 --> 34:01.120
And I'll make sure detective Fusco meets you

34:01.120 --> 34:03.300
And the witness at the ferry.

34:04.960 --> 34:07.510
You first.

34:19.050 --> 34:21.980
- Where are we going now? - Across the river.

34:21.980 --> 34:25.060
Come on, Laszlo, let's move.

34:27.300 --> 34:29.550
Just got a text. He's heading to pier 11.

34:29.550 --> 34:32.110
Let's get over there to intercept him, now.

34:40.489 --> 34:43.330
- Nice collar, detective. - You too, Carter.

34:43.330 --> 34:47.350
- You find out who called it in? - I have an idea.

35:00.510 --> 35:01.780
Yeah. Fusco.

35:01.780 --> 35:03.350
And I was just starting to believe

35:03.350 --> 35:04.790
That we could trust you, detective.

35:04.790 --> 35:06.190
I'm disappointed.

35:06.190 --> 35:07.620
What are you talking about?

35:07.620 --> 35:08.960
Elias' men are on their way

35:08.960 --> 35:10.620
To meet our friends at the ferry.

35:10.630 --> 35:13.690
- How the hell'd they find out? - I was going to ask you.

35:13.700 --> 35:16.130
- You're blaming me for this? - Then who told them?

35:16.130 --> 35:18.900
Listen, there's no way I would've--

35:18.900 --> 35:22.720
Detective, are you there?

35:36.770 --> 35:38.510
When we get you across the river,

35:38.510 --> 35:40.980
I'm going to hand you off to my detective.

35:40.980 --> 35:42.930
Now, you can trust him.

35:43.840 --> 35:46.060
Charlie, I need you to testify.

35:47.520 --> 35:49.290
One thing I know for sure--

35:49.290 --> 35:51.550
After everything we went through last night,

35:51.560 --> 35:53.790
I don't want to see these cretins running around my town

35:53.800 --> 35:54.760
Ever again.

36:01.770 --> 36:03.160
Thanks.

36:06.190 --> 36:07.170
Ready to talk?

36:07.170 --> 36:09.020
You ready to let me go?

36:09.480 --> 36:11.650
Peter, we got you on camera.

36:12.280 --> 36:13.980
We've got witnesses that say

36:13.980 --> 36:16.210
You and your brother were shooting up the streets

36:16.210 --> 36:17.460
In brighton beach.

36:19.380 --> 36:21.500
No idea what you're talking about.

36:24.190 --> 36:25.620
It's a beautiful morning.

36:26.910 --> 36:28.990
I have to thank you, John.

36:29.260 --> 36:30.610
To tell you the truth,

36:30.620 --> 36:31.910
I didn't think I'd see another one.

36:33.230 --> 36:35.730
Elias killed your uncle.

36:35.730 --> 36:37.480
You, your father, and your brother

36:37.480 --> 36:39.490
Went to the bodega for revenge.

36:39.490 --> 36:41.440
You didn't know what Elias looked like,

36:41.440 --> 36:43.840
So his lieutenant Benny D'agostino

36:43.840 --> 36:46.140
Was the next best thing.

36:46.140 --> 36:49.180
And now you're trying to rub out the witness--

36:49.180 --> 36:52.690
The guy who saw your father's face.

36:56.050 --> 36:57.890
We heard from a source

36:57.890 --> 36:59.590
That Elias was supposed to be at the bodega

36:59.590 --> 37:01.560
- That night. - he was meeting Benny.

37:01.560 --> 37:02.630
Yeah.

37:02.630 --> 37:04.390
But when we showed up...

37:04.400 --> 37:06.100
Benny was all we saw.

37:06.100 --> 37:09.730
Found out what really went down after the owner called us.

37:09.730 --> 37:11.110
He said there was another guy.

37:12.100 --> 37:13.990
Hey, what are you--

37:15.290 --> 37:16.740
Corrupt P.D.,

37:16.740 --> 37:18.240
Gun for hire?

37:18.240 --> 37:19.580
What kind of guy takes money

37:19.580 --> 37:21.290
To protect a scumbag like your boss here?

37:22.650 --> 37:24.280
You think he's going to testify...

37:24.280 --> 37:25.930
After everything he's done?

37:27.580 --> 37:28.750
He's tearing this town apart.

37:30.750 --> 37:32.600
What are you talking about?

37:34.610 --> 37:37.240
You don't know who he is, do you...

37:37.770 --> 37:39.480
What he's capable of?

37:40.500 --> 37:42.640
You don't really get it, do you?

37:43.900 --> 37:46.840
You honestly think we'd go to all this trouble

37:46.850 --> 37:47.690
For a witness?

37:54.760 --> 37:56.310
You're in the middle of a situation

37:56.310 --> 37:58.190
That you don't even understand.

38:00.380 --> 38:02.260
Don't make me shoot you, John.

38:04.220 --> 38:06.630
Drop your weapon and kick it to me, please.

38:15.370 --> 38:17.870
I thought you didn't like guns.

38:17.870 --> 38:20.800
You know, sometimes you have to do things you don't like.

38:20.800 --> 38:24.140
Like teaching history to the children of your enemies?

38:24.140 --> 38:26.110
Three years, I watched them--

38:26.110 --> 38:29.410
Cleaning up after the children of those pigs.

38:29.410 --> 38:31.010
It's a good amount of time to learn

38:31.020 --> 38:33.490
What makes your enemies tick, what makes them weak.

38:35.470 --> 38:37.720
You know all the secrets you and your family tried to hide,

38:37.720 --> 38:40.290
Laszlo, I learned all about from your own flesh and blood?

38:41.090 --> 38:43.470
Your children hate you almost as much as I do.

38:46.500 --> 38:48.160
Tie yourself to the railing, John,

38:48.170 --> 38:49.530
Nice and tight.

38:49.530 --> 38:50.700
I know how capable you are

38:50.700 --> 38:52.870
Of getting out of difficult situations.

38:52.870 --> 38:54.000
On your knees, please.

38:55.740 --> 38:57.970
You were meeting Benny at the bodega that day,

38:57.980 --> 38:59.070
Weren't you?

38:59.900 --> 39:02.050
The shooters were looking for you.

39:02.050 --> 39:04.280
Yeah, the benefits of no one knowing who you are

39:04.280 --> 39:05.690
Or what you look like.

39:05.900 --> 39:07.850
That's gone now, I suppose.

39:07.850 --> 39:09.710
It's time to evolve.

39:10.130 --> 39:12.200
I'm ready for the next step.

39:16.280 --> 39:17.230
Go ahead.

39:17.230 --> 39:19.330
I'd rather die than see you running my city.

39:19.330 --> 39:21.560
You know what Benny said before he died?

39:21.570 --> 39:23.330
He said, "Veni, vidi, vici"--

39:23.330 --> 39:25.100
I came, I saw, I won.

39:25.100 --> 39:28.290
He said your almighty Bratva was already crumbling.

39:28.540 --> 39:31.340
He said we'd already won.

39:31.340 --> 39:33.680
This is for Benny.

39:33.680 --> 39:35.450
Elias, if you kill him...

39:37.350 --> 39:39.080
I'm not going to kill him. -

39:39.820 --> 39:41.420
I'm just going to send a message.

39:42.850 --> 39:45.250
You tell your papa, Laszlo, if he gets out of town tonight,

39:45.260 --> 39:47.120
I'll let him live.

39:47.120 --> 39:49.400
Brighton beach belongs to me now.

39:52.870 --> 39:56.100
I thought about killing you, John.

39:56.100 --> 39:58.470
But I realize that that would seem ungrateful.

39:58.470 --> 40:01.900
Besides, how do you take the life of someone so talented?

40:01.910 --> 40:05.190
I could really use a guy like you in my organization.

40:07.880 --> 40:10.010
I wish you luck, John.

40:10.010 --> 40:12.480
If you stay out of my way, I'll stay out of yours.

40:12.480 --> 40:14.200
What if I don't?

40:17.190 --> 40:21.300
Then we'll meet again under less pleasant circumstances.

40:53.620 --> 40:55.960
You believe me now?

40:55.960 --> 40:59.360
I'm sorry, detective.

41:17.350 --> 41:19.180
Nice to see you, Lionel.

41:19.180 --> 41:21.150
Your suspect is tied to the railing.

41:21.850 --> 41:23.110
Tell him "You're welcome."

41:26.020 --> 41:29.000
Couldn't have known about Charlie.

41:30.170 --> 41:33.130
The machine found a man who was targeted for death.

41:33.130 --> 41:36.010
We just didn't know that he was also a killer.

41:36.390 --> 41:38.630
It's my fault he's out there, Finch.

41:38.640 --> 41:40.080
It's not yours alone.

41:41.090 --> 41:42.210
We just saved a man

41:42.210 --> 41:44.540
Whose only goal in life is revenge.

41:44.540 --> 41:46.610
He spent years studying his enemies

41:46.610 --> 41:48.210
Through their own children.

41:48.210 --> 41:51.280
John, we have limited information.

41:51.280 --> 41:55.030
We knew when we began this that we might make mistakes.

41:56.590 --> 41:58.590
But we have to go now.

41:58.590 --> 42:00.660
We have more people to help-- more numbers.

42:00.660 --> 42:02.590
and how many of those numbers will come up

42:02.590 --> 42:04.420
Because we saved one man's life?

42:59.150 --> 43:01.820
Boss...

43:01.820 --> 43:03.920
It's done.

43:03.920 --> 43:06.020
No, it's just beginning.

43:06.020 --> 43:08.510
Veni, vidi, vici.
