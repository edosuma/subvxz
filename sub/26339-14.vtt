WEBVTT

00:00.010 --> 00:02.900
- All right, now, get in the car.
- Can we check your oil?

00:02.930 --> 00:04.650
I get pulled into the
principal's office,

00:04.660 --> 00:05.950
and now you want a reward?

00:05.980 --> 00:07.700
The car will be going to the dealer

00:07.750 --> 00:08.900
to get the oil changed.

00:08.920 --> 00:10.350
But that's how they get you!

00:10.390 --> 00:11.900
And their coffee stinks.

00:11.960 --> 00:13.810
Oh, ho, Douglas. Looking sharp.

00:13.840 --> 00:14.940
What are you doing here so early?

00:14.980 --> 00:16.219
Apparently the girls were doing

00:16.260 --> 00:18.280
some unsanctioned renovation on the gym.

00:18.300 --> 00:19.310
Again.

00:19.350 --> 00:20.950
So I got pulled out of a work function.

00:20.980 --> 00:22.310
I understand.

00:22.350 --> 00:24.050
Well, if they supplied their own lumber,

00:24.070 --> 00:25.550
you should probably be thanking me.

00:27.200 --> 00:28.970
Right now?

00:29.010 --> 00:30.050
Fine.

00:31.480 --> 00:32.720
Did I miss the shrimp guy?

00:32.759 --> 00:34.330
I don't care who I'm talking to.

00:34.340 --> 00:36.390
The shrimp guy comes
around, you tell me.

00:36.430 --> 00:37.940
- A shrimp guy?
- Yep.

00:37.960 --> 00:39.260
What kind of party was this?

00:39.300 --> 00:41.330
The National Dermatology Awards.

00:41.370 --> 00:43.119
Tomorrow night, I'm getting a Dermy.

00:43.120 --> 00:44.900
Wow! Congratulations!

00:44.920 --> 00:47.110
You know what? I'm more
excited about the speech.

00:47.120 --> 00:48.220
But I can't even work on it

00:48.240 --> 00:50.260
because I'm dealing
with this kid nonsense.

00:50.300 --> 00:51.410
And now the principal

00:51.440 --> 00:53.860
wants me to sit down with
the school psychologist.

00:53.900 --> 00:55.800
Dr. Rhonda. Oh, I love her.

00:55.820 --> 00:57.159
Best kitten posters in the biz.

00:57.160 --> 00:58.169
Yeah, I'm not doing it.

00:58.170 --> 00:59.920
It goes against everything I believe in.

00:59.960 --> 01:02.090
My parenting philosophy is simple.

01:02.120 --> 01:04.360
If the car is running,
never pop the hood.

01:04.390 --> 01:06.079
Uh, you got to pop the hood

01:06.080 --> 01:07.089
once in a while.

01:07.090 --> 01:09.020
And nobody does it
better than Dr. Rhonda.

01:09.040 --> 01:11.410
I value our weekly one-on-one
sessions more than anything.

01:11.430 --> 01:13.030
- You see her every week?
- Oh, sure.

01:13.070 --> 01:14.440
Afraid that's the limit.

01:14.600 --> 01:17.450
Look, I know you're skeptical,
but if you see Dr. Rhonda,

01:17.490 --> 01:20.100
I promise she will
make your life easier.

01:20.140 --> 01:21.940
Douglas, are your girls
working on my car?

01:21.980 --> 01:24.530
No! I said no oil change!

01:24.540 --> 01:26.320
You just said your car.

01:26.360 --> 01:28.280
Next time, be more specific.

01:28.320 --> 01:31.250
I'm mad at them, but I'm
very excited for you.

01:31.280 --> 01:33.620
You're gonna be very
happy with their work.

01:33.670 --> 01:34.840
Hm.

01:34.870 --> 01:39.870
- Synced & corrected by<font color="#E83286"> MementMori </font>-
-- <font color="#138CE9">www.addic7ed.com</font> --

01:41.840 --> 01:44.250
So I said, "You're gonna
have to give me a reason

01:44.260 --> 01:45.410
to order more of this Riesling."

01:45.430 --> 01:46.580
- Oh!
- Oh! I get it.

01:46.600 --> 01:48.460
And then I woke up, so...

01:48.470 --> 01:50.770
Girl, you got to say up front
if the story is a dream.

01:50.780 --> 01:51.789
Seriously.

01:51.790 --> 01:53.750
I would walk away right
now if I weren't stuck

01:53.770 --> 01:56.420
waiting for Graham and
his new friend, Alex.

01:56.440 --> 01:57.810
He's been talking about him non-stop.

01:57.860 --> 02:01.100
Sounds like this Alex is a
pretty big "get" for Graham.

02:01.110 --> 02:02.450
Alex?

02:02.480 --> 02:03.600
Eye roll.

02:03.620 --> 02:04.980
Damn, dude. You sound jealous.

02:05.040 --> 02:06.360
I'm not. Trust me.

02:06.380 --> 02:07.639
Graham will be done with Alex

02:07.640 --> 02:09.570
just in time for my
spring sweater unveiling.

02:09.610 --> 02:10.840
Oh, well, I really hope so,

02:10.850 --> 02:13.680
because Alex's mom, Nora,
doesn't do drop-off playdates,

02:13.700 --> 02:15.290
so that means I'm forced to hang out

02:15.330 --> 02:16.710
with a total stranger for hours.

02:16.750 --> 02:18.320
- "Mom Playdates" are torture.
- Ugh.

02:18.340 --> 02:20.080
Hearing their parenting philosophies,

02:20.120 --> 02:21.300
you telling them your life story,

02:21.330 --> 02:22.670
all the fake laughing.

02:22.720 --> 02:25.619
"Okay. Okay." It's not okay.

02:25.620 --> 02:27.890
It is all of the worst
parts of a first date

02:27.920 --> 02:29.360
- with none of the alcohol.
- Yes.

02:29.370 --> 02:32.010
God, I am so lucky that
I met you when I did.

02:32.060 --> 02:34.980
Cheerios, Angie. Next time, Cheerios.

02:35.020 --> 02:36.480
Cheerios don't melt.

02:38.470 --> 02:39.630
Crap.

02:41.020 --> 02:42.190
Got you covered.

02:44.000 --> 02:45.940
- Keep it.
- The whole pack?

02:46.020 --> 02:47.190
Yeah.

02:47.240 --> 02:49.020
That's, like, the nicest thing

02:49.030 --> 02:50.480
that anyone's ever done for me.

02:50.500 --> 02:52.150
Well, you look like you're having a day.

02:53.420 --> 02:54.780
You want to talk about it?

02:54.820 --> 02:56.370
This is Graham.

02:56.420 --> 02:57.670
This is Rory.

02:57.700 --> 02:59.620
Graham and I got more
than wipes that day.

02:59.660 --> 03:00.840
We got best friends.

03:00.870 --> 03:02.420
And a three-hour therapy session

03:02.460 --> 03:03.820
on my romantic blind spots.

03:03.840 --> 03:06.040
- I remember that.
- Man. I never go to the park.

03:06.060 --> 03:07.080
Too much grass.

03:07.100 --> 03:09.479
Should I be getting out there
and finding Jack a best friend?

03:09.480 --> 03:11.380
No, no, no. Dad playdates
don't work like that.

03:11.430 --> 03:12.680
Men are not looking for a connection.

03:12.720 --> 03:14.219
Two dads will just sit there in silence,

03:14.220 --> 03:15.550
on their phones, the entire time.

03:15.610 --> 03:18.440
Maybe they'll start things off
with some mild sports talk.

03:18.460 --> 03:21.060
Yeah, like, uh, "Yo, you
see that game? Crazy."

03:21.110 --> 03:23.190
- "Crazy game."
- It was crazy.

03:23.230 --> 03:25.700
Hey, Mom. This is Alex and his mom.

03:25.710 --> 03:26.729
Hi.

03:26.730 --> 03:28.180
Nora.

03:28.200 --> 03:30.180
Looking forward to the playdate later.

03:30.200 --> 03:31.570
That kid is tiny as hell.

03:31.600 --> 03:32.840
How old is he?

03:32.850 --> 03:33.860
I'm this many.

03:33.870 --> 03:35.940
Whoa. Yo, that's four fingers.

03:35.980 --> 03:37.040
Graham's friend is 4.

03:37.080 --> 03:39.140
Mm-hmm. A real big get.

03:40.270 --> 03:41.560
Dr. Rhonda.

03:41.600 --> 03:44.140
I was referred to you by Will Cooper.

03:44.160 --> 03:45.880
Now, let's never speak of him again.

03:45.920 --> 03:47.320
He's not here, is he?

03:47.350 --> 03:48.520
- What?
- He's very nice.

03:48.540 --> 03:50.169
It's just, as a parent,

03:50.170 --> 03:52.410
he can be... very present.

03:52.440 --> 03:54.480
- You think?
- So, Dr. Fogerty,

03:54.500 --> 03:55.510
before I share my findings,

03:55.550 --> 03:57.110
I'd like to hear from you
about your daughters.

03:57.150 --> 03:59.880
Okay, well, they're,
uh, short and blond.

03:59.920 --> 04:02.950
Uh, one of them has a
thing under her eye.

04:02.990 --> 04:04.400
Not what they look like.

04:04.440 --> 04:06.040
Tell me about them as individuals.

04:06.070 --> 04:07.540
Hard to say, you know?

04:07.550 --> 04:09.110
They always do everything together.

04:09.140 --> 04:11.130
They're, uh, always on the same page.

04:11.160 --> 04:13.230
They never fight. Not to brag,

04:13.260 --> 04:17.300
but I've successfully fused
them into one child...

04:17.329 --> 04:19.579
a child who spends all of her time

04:19.600 --> 04:21.300
in the shed out back.

04:21.339 --> 04:23.700
And... what goes on in this shed?

04:23.720 --> 04:25.620
It... It's their private space,

04:25.660 --> 04:29.190
and I've always made it a
point not to go back there.

04:34.020 --> 04:36.350
It's none of my business.

04:36.390 --> 04:38.950
If I had to guess, I would say, mm...

04:38.990 --> 04:41.960
I don't know... auto-body
projects, cabinetry,

04:41.990 --> 04:43.320
maybe a mechanical bull.

04:43.360 --> 04:46.200
Uh, peanut shells all over the floor.

04:46.220 --> 04:47.340
You know?

04:47.350 --> 04:48.500
These are all just guesses

04:48.520 --> 04:51.350
that are based on the, uh, sounds

04:51.380 --> 04:53.980
I... I hear coming from the shed.

04:54.000 --> 04:55.870
You know, kids, right?

04:55.910 --> 04:58.210
While I'm tempted to dig into that,

04:58.240 --> 05:00.170
uh, I do want to share my findings.

05:00.210 --> 05:02.400
You see, Dr. Fogerty, in my business,

05:02.460 --> 05:04.850
nothing is as exciting as testing twins.

05:04.880 --> 05:06.640
- Really?
- I'm not gonna lie,

05:06.700 --> 05:07.950
I'm flying right now.

05:07.980 --> 05:11.390
Your girls, while identical,
are very different.

05:11.420 --> 05:12.620
I ran some tests,

05:12.630 --> 05:14.820
and while Amy is right on grade level,

05:14.860 --> 05:17.980
Emma presents as mathematically gifted.

05:18.120 --> 05:19.660
She's acting out because she's bored.

05:19.700 --> 05:22.040
Okay. So my daughter's a
genius. Have we solved it?

05:22.120 --> 05:25.630
No. Being a parent to a gifted
child is a full-time job.

05:25.670 --> 05:26.970
Terrific.

05:28.190 --> 05:29.820
- It's him.
- I'm not here.

05:29.860 --> 05:31.380
I'm just gonna let it go to voicemail.

05:32.040 --> 05:34.180
So, I guess I know now

05:34.200 --> 05:35.610
why you don't do drop-off playdates.

05:35.650 --> 05:39.100
Yeah. He doesn't really go to
the bathroom by himself yet.

05:39.120 --> 05:41.980
Graham, I have to ask...
how did you two meet?

05:42.060 --> 05:44.400
Well, it happened last week.

05:44.440 --> 05:46.140
You were late picking me up again.

05:46.160 --> 05:48.220
We bonded immediately.

05:48.260 --> 05:51.090
We had plenty of time, because, again,

05:51.130 --> 05:52.780
you were so late picking me up.

05:52.800 --> 05:54.630
Okay, we got it. Why don't you go play?

05:54.680 --> 05:56.850
So...

05:57.930 --> 05:59.130
... where are you from?

05:59.170 --> 06:00.790
I'm gonna stop you right there.

06:00.820 --> 06:03.750
We don't need to be friends just
'cause our kids are friends.

06:03.770 --> 06:05.910
- We don't?
- Absolutely not.

06:05.940 --> 06:07.070
I brought a ton of work,

06:07.110 --> 06:09.180
and I've got my own
drinks, my own snacks,

06:09.210 --> 06:10.480
everything ready to go, so...

06:10.510 --> 06:13.150
In fact, if you need anything,
I'd prefer you just text me.

06:13.200 --> 06:14.280
So you're suggesting that we do

06:14.300 --> 06:17.279
our own completely separate
thing in the same space,

06:17.280 --> 06:19.260
like one of those combo
Pizza Hut/Taco Bells?

06:20.120 --> 06:22.410
Wow. I think I love you.

06:22.440 --> 06:23.570
- Just...
- Oh, yeah.

06:23.590 --> 06:24.839
- Oh, I will.
- Yeah.

06:25.850 --> 06:28.060
Douglas, as the father
of a gifted child,

06:28.100 --> 06:29.860
please allow me to
welcome you to the club.

06:29.920 --> 06:31.670
I don't want to be part of this club.

06:31.720 --> 06:33.800
Look, before you got
involved, I had one kid.

06:33.840 --> 06:35.820
And now, thanks to you, I have two.

06:35.860 --> 06:39.110
Plus, Dr. Rhonda wants me to
drive to Sylmar next weekend

06:39.160 --> 06:41.840
for something called Fraction Fest.

06:41.890 --> 06:44.000
Hey, Soph, get this... turns
out Emma's a math genius.

06:44.020 --> 06:45.199
They're going to Frac Fest, too!

06:45.200 --> 06:47.380
Emma? She dips her chips in milk.

06:47.400 --> 06:48.750
How did, uh, Amy take it?

06:48.800 --> 06:50.050
It's none of my business,

06:50.060 --> 06:52.260
but I would like to think that
they're handling it well.

06:53.460 --> 06:56.070
I guess you're not an air
hockey genius, either.

06:56.110 --> 06:57.380
What'd you just say to me?

06:57.410 --> 06:58.590
Girls, I'm on the phone.

06:58.630 --> 06:59.760
Emma said I'm dumb.

06:59.800 --> 07:01.260
You're not dumb,

07:01.300 --> 07:03.680
but God doesn't give with both hands.

07:03.720 --> 07:04.800
Know what I mean?

07:04.830 --> 07:06.270
No.

07:06.300 --> 07:07.520
But I don't like it.

07:07.540 --> 07:09.350
You just worry about being pretty,

07:09.360 --> 07:10.369
'kay, hot stuff?

07:10.370 --> 07:11.490
Uh, hey, c-come on now.

07:11.520 --> 07:13.240
You're supposed to be a team, remember?

07:13.290 --> 07:14.910
You got to figure this out on your own.

07:14.960 --> 07:16.630
The old man's right.

07:16.640 --> 07:19.080
There's only one way out of this.

07:21.000 --> 07:23.019
Good. Now they're fighting.
They never fight.

07:23.020 --> 07:24.540
Tony, get in there. See, Will?

07:24.550 --> 07:26.600
This is what happens
when you pop the hood.

07:26.620 --> 07:28.810
Well, I'm sure you want
to roll up your sleeves

07:28.840 --> 07:30.900
and get your hands greasy,
so I'll leave you to it.

07:30.920 --> 07:33.210
Oh, no. Wrong. You're part of this now.

07:33.230 --> 07:34.510
I have the Dermys tomorrow,

07:34.550 --> 07:36.060
so clear your schedule and then...

07:36.100 --> 07:38.100
Oh. Oh, God. I got to go.

07:38.150 --> 07:40.080
Y-Yeah. Yeah, Tony's on the ground.

07:40.100 --> 07:41.319
They... They got Tony.

07:41.320 --> 07:42.529
How you like that, old man?!

07:42.530 --> 07:43.740
Cover your face, Tony!

07:43.770 --> 07:46.520
J-Just roll into a ball,
like an armadillo.

07:47.480 --> 07:49.630
- Angie. Hey.
- Hey.

07:49.660 --> 07:51.770
Don't run off without giving
me those playdate deets.

07:51.780 --> 07:52.980
So, how bad was it?

07:52.990 --> 07:54.840
Is your face sore from
all the fake smiling?

07:54.900 --> 07:57.319
Dude, it was actually kind of great.

07:57.320 --> 07:59.150
It turns out Nora's a dad-mom.

07:59.190 --> 08:00.200
We barely even talked.

08:00.210 --> 08:01.440
I got so much done.

08:01.460 --> 08:03.660
I made a dentist appointment,
I paid parking tickets,

08:03.680 --> 08:05.760
I finally got around to that
"what color is the dress" thing.

08:05.800 --> 08:06.830
We're hanging out again today.

08:06.860 --> 08:08.750
Oh. Well, what about our Wednesday hang?

08:08.780 --> 08:10.900
Oh, my God.

08:10.930 --> 08:12.570
I knew I was forgetting something.

08:12.580 --> 08:13.800
I'm so sorry. Can we reschedule?

08:13.820 --> 08:16.380
Reschedule our standing Wednesday hang?

08:16.400 --> 08:18.510
I got offered tickets to "The
Bachelor: Women Tell All"

08:18.540 --> 08:21.010
but didn't go because...
it was a Wednesday.

08:21.060 --> 08:22.390
This Nora must be something else.

08:22.410 --> 08:24.550
Well, don't be jealous of Nora.

08:24.560 --> 08:26.749
She's just a refreshing change of pace.

08:26.750 --> 08:27.759
Refreshing?

08:27.760 --> 08:29.250
Well, yeah. I mean, come on, Poppy.

08:29.290 --> 08:31.940
You know that hanging out
with you can be... a lot.

08:31.970 --> 08:34.260
Oh. Okay, well, I see how it is.

08:34.289 --> 08:35.299
Tell me how you really feel.

08:35.309 --> 08:37.590
Sometimes we go deep, you know,

08:37.630 --> 08:38.890
and it can be exhausting

08:38.900 --> 08:41.080
talking about my fears and
desires and my childhood,

08:41.100 --> 08:42.960
and sometimes I don't
want to think about

08:42.980 --> 08:43.990
if my parents loved each other.

08:44.000 --> 08:45.420
I just want to chill.

08:45.450 --> 08:47.899
Oh. Well, I hope you
have fun being chill

08:47.900 --> 08:48.970
and cleaning out your inbox

08:49.010 --> 08:51.040
with that toddler and his rando mom.

08:51.070 --> 08:52.660
And the dress is blue.

08:55.860 --> 08:57.580
Good news.

08:57.610 --> 09:00.400
The conflict resolution
you ordered has arrived.

09:00.430 --> 09:01.440
I hope you're right,

09:01.450 --> 09:03.080
because Amy has just put Emma

09:03.120 --> 09:04.879
up for sale on Craigslist.

09:04.880 --> 09:07.890
Lucky for you, I attended Dr.
Rhonda's three-day seminar

09:07.920 --> 09:09.590
on sibling rivalry,

09:09.640 --> 09:11.230
and you don't go to a
convention like that

09:11.260 --> 09:13.020
and not take notes. Am I right?

09:13.040 --> 09:14.880
You went to a sibling
rivalry convention?

09:14.910 --> 09:16.000
You only got one kid.

09:16.030 --> 09:17.630
Well, we're thinking
about getting a dog.

09:17.670 --> 09:20.180
My dad's read, like, every
parenting book there is.

09:20.220 --> 09:21.539
Wrote a few, too.

09:21.540 --> 09:23.220
- Still unpublished.
- We don't...

09:23.240 --> 09:25.090
need to advertise that.

09:25.120 --> 09:27.180
I'm just happy I finally
get to use all that info

09:27.200 --> 09:28.880
that's been rattling around in my brain.

09:28.910 --> 09:30.610
And then Amy will be all better

09:30.650 --> 09:32.660
once I sprinkle a little
Dr. Rhon-dust on them.

09:32.700 --> 09:34.870
O-Okay, listen. I don't have to
know how the sausage is made.

09:34.880 --> 09:36.920
- Just make them one kid again.
- Mm-hmm.

09:36.930 --> 09:38.500
Now, I'm on my way to the Dermys,

09:38.520 --> 09:40.760
where I will be roasting my peers

09:40.790 --> 09:42.640
until a string quartet cuts me off.

09:42.680 --> 09:45.060
When I get back, I want this fixed.

09:45.090 --> 09:47.290
We are now in a trustful space.

09:47.330 --> 09:48.620
We listen to each other.

09:48.660 --> 09:50.050
We don't talk over each other.

09:50.080 --> 09:52.260
We're communicating without words,

09:52.300 --> 09:55.020
which is what humans used to do
before we invented language.

09:55.040 --> 09:57.260
Okay? Now, don't break eye contact,

09:57.280 --> 09:58.440
but think about the closeness

09:58.490 --> 09:59.610
you shared inside the womb.

09:59.640 --> 10:01.980
I should've eaten you
when I had the chance!

10:02.010 --> 10:03.680
I would've eaten you!

10:03.730 --> 10:04.880
Ladies, ladies!

10:04.890 --> 10:06.360
Okay, okay.

10:08.080 --> 10:09.130
Oh, boy.

10:09.150 --> 10:10.230
And even though

10:10.270 --> 10:13.020
I'm three minutes older than you,

10:13.060 --> 10:17.560
I value you as a sister and a peer.

10:17.590 --> 10:18.880
Thank you!

10:18.900 --> 10:22.000
And now, allow me to complete
the compliment circle.

10:22.030 --> 10:23.560
- Aww!
- Aww!

10:23.600 --> 10:26.200
This is what you guys were
making for half an hour?

10:26.240 --> 10:27.270
I hate this.

10:27.300 --> 10:29.050
I hate this more than you do.

10:29.090 --> 10:30.910
You know, you guys aren't even
really giving it a chance.

10:30.940 --> 10:32.320
- Shut up.
- Shut up.

10:33.880 --> 10:35.640
Putting them in the same shirt?

10:36.750 --> 10:37.950
This feels like a reach.

10:37.980 --> 10:39.200
I'm riffing, okay?

10:39.220 --> 10:40.830
But look, at least they're
talking to each other.

10:40.870 --> 10:42.600
Get away from me, Average!

10:42.640 --> 10:43.670
That's it!

10:43.690 --> 10:45.070
I want a divorce!

10:45.100 --> 10:47.199
You can't make it out there without me.

10:47.200 --> 10:48.340
I'm the brains.

10:51.060 --> 10:53.030
What's important is
they did that together.

10:55.210 --> 10:56.710
Yeah.

10:56.730 --> 10:59.479
So, according to Angie,
hanging out with me

10:59.480 --> 11:01.740
is like being on an elliptical
with no headphones.

11:01.770 --> 11:02.819
Ah, the elliptical.

11:02.820 --> 11:04.860
I like to call that one
"The Double Slot Machine."

11:04.880 --> 11:07.040
Cha-ching, cha-ching, cha-ching,
cha-ching, cha-ching, cha-ching!

11:07.080 --> 11:08.210
Miggy, do you think I'm a lot?

11:08.240 --> 11:10.180
What? No. No way. You're, like...

11:10.210 --> 11:12.099
Ooh, wait. In what context?

11:12.100 --> 11:14.560
Because in terms of talking
with you and being with you,

11:14.570 --> 11:17.220
- you're kind of a lot.
- You are way off. I am chill as hell.

11:17.240 --> 11:18.620
I have a membership to
a botanical garden.

11:18.650 --> 11:20.440
- Oh, that is chill.
- Exactly.

11:20.480 --> 11:24.019
In fact, I'm gonna stop
by Angie's playdate

11:24.020 --> 11:26.090
to show her just how chill I can be.

11:26.150 --> 11:27.340
Rory, you stay here.

11:27.350 --> 11:29.030
What? Why should I
have to miss the drama

11:29.070 --> 11:30.350
and be stuck here with Miggy?

11:30.380 --> 11:31.570
Dude, you can come with me to the park,

11:31.600 --> 11:32.850
and we can cruise for friends for Jack.

11:32.890 --> 11:34.200
There's a father and son out there

11:34.250 --> 11:36.070
about to get wiped, and
they don't even know!

11:36.110 --> 11:37.670
That's gonna end in disaster.

11:37.710 --> 11:39.160
So you know I'm in.

11:40.790 --> 11:41.930
You okay, Dad?

11:41.960 --> 11:44.610
Yeah. I just feel depleted.

11:44.650 --> 11:46.230
Did you take your B12?

11:46.270 --> 11:47.970
Of course.

11:48.000 --> 11:50.650
You know, I know it might
feel like we're not helping,

11:50.690 --> 11:51.820
but I think we are.

11:51.850 --> 11:53.090
I don't hear any fighting.

11:53.120 --> 11:54.370
You guys are still here?

11:54.410 --> 11:55.740
We're done.

11:55.800 --> 11:56.990
Emma left.

11:57.030 --> 11:58.560
Man, it was ugly.

11:58.590 --> 12:00.590
But in the end, I got the shed.

12:00.630 --> 12:01.750
What did she get?

12:01.760 --> 12:03.260
Wait, where did Emma go?

12:08.480 --> 12:09.799
Whoa! Watch out!

12:09.800 --> 12:11.520
On your left!

12:13.230 --> 12:14.410
Representative.

12:14.440 --> 12:16.130
Rep... Representative.

12:16.160 --> 12:18.640
Hey, Nora? Did you
unplug my coffee maker?

12:18.650 --> 12:20.290
Yeah, my laptop was at 15%,

12:20.300 --> 12:22.120
and you're kinda hogging
all the outlets.

12:22.170 --> 12:23.500
Representative.

12:23.540 --> 12:24.850
Are those my slippers?

12:24.890 --> 12:27.599
Oh, yeah. My feet were
really cold, so...

12:27.600 --> 12:28.960
And who's that guy?

12:28.990 --> 12:30.890
Oh. That's Lenny, my accountant.

12:32.040 --> 12:33.630
Oh, hi. Yes.

12:33.660 --> 12:36.100
I would like to redeem my miles.

12:36.160 --> 12:37.280
I'll get it.

12:37.300 --> 12:38.970
I'm sure it's for you.

12:39.020 --> 12:41.600
Hello, Angela. What's
good? I don't even care.

12:41.650 --> 12:44.220
Thank God you're here.

12:44.240 --> 12:46.379
This playdate just took
a really weird turn,

12:46.380 --> 12:47.419
and I need to talk about it.

12:47.420 --> 12:49.610
Oh, sorry. I'm not here
to get into anything.

12:49.650 --> 12:52.310
I just came over to quietly
pay some bills at your table.

12:52.350 --> 12:53.360
Okay, w-what is this?

12:53.370 --> 12:55.080
You're not still mad at me, are you?

12:55.120 --> 12:56.360
No. No.

12:56.380 --> 12:58.370
I'm just having a dream Wednesday,

12:58.390 --> 12:59.870
living my best life.

12:59.890 --> 13:02.260
Okay, you're speaking like
an Instagram caption,

13:02.310 --> 13:04.420
which is usually a pretty
clear sign that you're mad.

13:04.440 --> 13:05.510
Can we talk about this?

13:05.540 --> 13:08.100
Sorry. Not really into talking.

13:08.150 --> 13:11.520
How can everyone afford
noise-canceling headphones?

13:13.550 --> 13:14.719
"Good evening, ladies and gentlemen,

13:14.720 --> 13:16.220
and thank you for this award.

13:16.240 --> 13:17.890
It took a lot of hard work.

13:17.910 --> 13:20.019
And now I would like to take this moment

13:20.020 --> 13:22.360
to recognize the people
who did not help me,

13:22.390 --> 13:23.580
alphabetically.

13:23.610 --> 13:25.610
Amy Adams, Paul Anka"...

13:25.670 --> 13:27.330
There's a child scootering
up the middle aisle!

13:27.370 --> 13:28.959
She plowed right through
the gift-bag table!

13:28.960 --> 13:30.400
There's moisturizer everywhere!

13:30.420 --> 13:32.420
Oh, no. That sounds like one of my mine.

13:32.460 --> 13:34.040
Ooh! Man.

13:34.070 --> 13:35.700
Pico was jammed.

13:37.090 --> 13:38.760
Emma, I'm about to go on stage.

13:38.790 --> 13:40.580
- How did you even get here?
- My hog.

13:40.600 --> 13:43.500
But I told you to only scooter
within a five-mile radius,

13:43.510 --> 13:44.650
and you drove to Beverly Hills?

13:44.680 --> 13:47.099
Who cares? Amy hates me.

13:47.100 --> 13:48.870
A-All right, look. Talk to me.

13:48.900 --> 13:49.989
Tony, this is a good chance

13:49.990 --> 13:52.050
for you to hit my shoulders
with the roller.

13:52.090 --> 13:53.760
Amy said she wants a divorce.

13:53.770 --> 13:55.390
Look, she's just being dramatic.

13:55.430 --> 13:57.470
All right, this is what I'm gonna
do. We're gonna go home.

13:57.480 --> 13:59.680
We're gonna work all of
this out after my speech.

13:59.700 --> 14:00.850
And the cocktail hour.

14:00.870 --> 14:02.280
And the after party.

14:02.320 --> 14:03.850
I promised Tony I'd be his wingman.

14:03.860 --> 14:07.070
Dad, she's never been
this mad at me before.

14:07.160 --> 14:08.270
I'm scared.

14:08.310 --> 14:09.820
You know, I don't think
she's mad at you.

14:09.860 --> 14:12.600
I think that she's
probably just... jealous.

14:12.620 --> 14:14.760
You're right. This is all my fault.

14:14.800 --> 14:16.700
I wish I wasn't smart.

14:17.840 --> 14:19.620
Come here.

14:19.700 --> 14:21.080
I want you to hear me.

14:21.120 --> 14:22.940
This is not your fault.

14:22.970 --> 14:24.540
Okay?

14:27.780 --> 14:29.939
Tony, I need you to step in for me here.

14:29.940 --> 14:31.240
I want these word-for-word,

14:31.260 --> 14:32.980
and keep your politics out of it.

14:33.010 --> 14:34.400
Come on, Emma.

14:39.400 --> 14:41.650
Emma is writing you a formal apology

14:41.690 --> 14:42.920
on the family letterhead

14:42.960 --> 14:44.870
for taking her scooter to Beverly Hills

14:44.910 --> 14:46.410
without telling you.

14:46.440 --> 14:49.660
However inappropriate, she
did make amazing time.

14:49.680 --> 14:52.219
100 Dr. Rhonda seminars
would not have prepared me

14:52.220 --> 14:53.660
for the things I've seen today.

14:53.760 --> 14:56.250
I came in here thinking I
was a parenting expert,

14:56.290 --> 14:57.720
and your children have humbled me.

14:57.730 --> 14:59.960
I let you down, bud.
I failed you. I'm sorry.

14:59.990 --> 15:01.820
Ah, stop beating yourself up.

15:01.910 --> 15:03.710
I gave you an impossible task.

15:03.750 --> 15:05.410
I wanted them to be one kid

15:05.450 --> 15:08.110
so I wouldn't feel like
I was outnumbered.

15:08.150 --> 15:10.620
But they've always been two kids.

15:10.650 --> 15:12.650
I'm the parent of two kids.

15:12.690 --> 15:14.820
You do know where Amy is, right?

15:14.860 --> 15:16.640
She moved herself out to the shed.

15:16.660 --> 15:18.440
Asked us to forward her mail.

15:19.640 --> 15:20.860
Well...

15:20.900 --> 15:24.030
I've been running from
this for a very long time.

15:24.070 --> 15:26.500
But I always knew this day would come.

15:33.090 --> 15:34.500
You got this, big guy.

15:34.520 --> 15:36.340
It's gonna go great.

15:38.880 --> 15:41.650
Oh, great. What is your
Wi-Fi password, Angela?

15:41.680 --> 15:43.420
Poppy, come on, all right?

15:43.450 --> 15:44.480
You need to help me.

15:44.500 --> 15:47.050
T-This woman, I-I don't think
she's ever gonna leave.

15:47.090 --> 15:48.940
She put up corkboard, and
I just overheard her

15:48.950 --> 15:50.320
ordering way too much Indian food.

15:50.330 --> 15:51.360
Sounds really bad,

15:51.370 --> 15:53.190
but I'm not here to get
personally involved.

15:53.230 --> 15:55.480
I'm just trying to give you
that chill dad-mom energy

15:55.500 --> 15:56.830
that you want from a friend.

15:56.860 --> 15:58.380
I don't want to be a lot.

15:59.180 --> 16:04.020
Look, Poppy, I'm sorry
that I offended you.

16:04.040 --> 16:05.870
But you know that you being a lot

16:05.960 --> 16:07.920
is one of the best things about you.

16:07.960 --> 16:10.560
The day that we met in the park
and you gave me the wipes,

16:10.620 --> 16:12.660
it changed my life.

16:12.680 --> 16:14.160
I love that we go deep,

16:14.170 --> 16:15.950
and I love that you know me so well.

16:15.980 --> 16:17.670
And I know you so well.

16:17.700 --> 16:18.739
I know you so well,

16:18.740 --> 16:21.540
I know you're not listening
to music in those headphones.

16:23.070 --> 16:24.690
Okay. Fine.

16:24.730 --> 16:25.940
I'm not.

16:25.980 --> 16:27.199
They're not even plugged in to anything.

16:27.200 --> 16:29.259
- I know!
- I know I'm overreacting.

16:29.260 --> 16:30.940
I get jealous sometimes.

16:31.000 --> 16:33.500
Truth is, I love being
your only mom friend.

16:33.520 --> 16:35.520
And you have nothing to worry about.

16:35.550 --> 16:37.790
You know, I really don't like... people.

16:37.820 --> 16:38.830
I know.

16:38.840 --> 16:40.209
Now, will you please help me

16:40.210 --> 16:41.699
- get this woman out of here?
- Mm.

16:41.700 --> 16:43.540
She's gone through all
the generic hummus,

16:43.560 --> 16:45.590
and now she's about to hit the good
stuff in the back of the fridge.

16:45.650 --> 16:47.750
- Got you covered. I'm going in...
- Okay.

16:47.780 --> 16:50.670
... and I'm gonna go... deep.

16:50.700 --> 16:52.600
Yeah, I just need to speak
to whoever's above you.

16:52.650 --> 16:54.359
I don't care if it's the
president of the airline,

16:54.360 --> 16:55.369
so, okay?

16:55.370 --> 16:57.080
Okay, can we talk about
what's going on here?

16:57.100 --> 16:58.840
What's going on is that I've
been on hold for an hour,

16:58.880 --> 17:00.740
so I can't hang up the phone.

17:00.780 --> 17:02.550
I see everything you're
going through right now.

17:02.580 --> 17:04.118
You need to redeem these miles

17:04.119 --> 17:06.819
because the walls are closing in
on you at home with the 4-year-old

17:06.869 --> 17:08.520
and you'll go anywhere.

17:08.550 --> 17:11.420
In fact, you'll even set up
shop at a stranger's house

17:11.460 --> 17:12.878
because it doesn't matter where you go,

17:12.880 --> 17:14.720
as long as you get that escape.

17:16.490 --> 17:19.400
Ricky said he would help with childcare,

17:19.430 --> 17:21.920
but where is he, you know? He's just out

17:21.980 --> 17:24.099
seeing improv shows every
single night of the week.

17:24.140 --> 17:25.500
Come on now, Ricky!

17:25.550 --> 17:27.499
You just gonna make this woman
a prisoner in her own home

17:27.500 --> 17:28.620
for some improv?!

17:30.640 --> 17:32.020
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

17:32.060 --> 17:34.580
I don't really get to talk about
this stuff normally, so...

17:34.600 --> 17:37.560
I'm here at the Winebrary,
in case you ever need me.

17:37.720 --> 17:39.680
But right now, you have to get
up out this woman's house,

17:39.730 --> 17:42.020
take yourself home, and
hear about some improv.

17:42.050 --> 17:44.220
Alex, time to go, buddy.

17:44.270 --> 17:46.140
Sorry for taking over.

17:46.160 --> 17:48.320
You set up a wonderful workspace.

17:48.360 --> 17:49.930
Oh.

17:49.960 --> 17:51.130
Thank you?

17:58.960 --> 18:01.050
Look what the cat dragged in.

18:01.090 --> 18:03.390
Wow.

18:03.420 --> 18:05.670
This place has running water, huh?

18:06.910 --> 18:07.980
And A.C.?

18:08.010 --> 18:09.840
Relax. It's all permitted.

18:09.860 --> 18:11.930
Listen, I know it doesn't
always seem like

18:11.950 --> 18:14.650
I want to talk about
what's going on with you,

18:14.690 --> 18:17.600
but, uh, right now, I'm
gonna do it anyway.

18:17.620 --> 18:20.519
Your sister is really upset.

18:20.520 --> 18:23.560
She's upset? What about me?

18:23.620 --> 18:26.420
I knew we would have to do
different things sometimes.

18:26.560 --> 18:28.660
I just didn't think
Emma would be special

18:28.700 --> 18:29.730
and I wouldn't.

18:29.770 --> 18:31.170
Oh, I know how you feel.

18:31.200 --> 18:33.900
My sisters Donna and Lenore,
may they rest in peace,

18:33.920 --> 18:35.770
were synchronized-skating stars.

18:35.820 --> 18:38.070
Everyone in the family fawned over them,

18:38.110 --> 18:39.740
and no one cared about my drawings.

18:40.320 --> 18:43.480
Bowl of fruit after
bowl of fruit ignored.

18:43.500 --> 18:44.750
You used to draw?

18:44.780 --> 18:45.880
Oh, all the time.

18:45.890 --> 18:48.720
Most dermatologists are
failed architects.

18:48.750 --> 18:50.590
Nobody knows that, but it's true.

18:50.640 --> 18:52.390
I drew all this crap.

18:53.560 --> 18:54.780
You dr...

18:54.800 --> 18:57.790
Amy, these... these are exceptional!

18:57.830 --> 18:59.860
Schools don't test for this.

18:59.900 --> 19:01.560
D-Do you realize that every project

19:01.580 --> 19:03.300
that you and your sister ever made

19:03.320 --> 19:05.700
started with your imagination?

19:05.740 --> 19:07.000
That's right.

19:08.270 --> 19:10.710
Hey, there it is...
the air hockey table.

19:10.740 --> 19:13.240
Last thing we made
together before the split.

19:13.280 --> 19:15.080
When we're building things,

19:15.120 --> 19:17.110
it's like nothing else matters.

19:17.150 --> 19:19.380
But she's a genius now,

19:19.420 --> 19:22.579
and I'm just a ding dong
with the same face.

19:22.580 --> 19:24.340
No. No, you're not.

19:24.370 --> 19:26.090
Listen to me.

19:26.120 --> 19:28.560
You and your sister are special

19:28.590 --> 19:30.490
in two totally different ways,

19:30.530 --> 19:32.660
and you make a great team together.

19:32.700 --> 19:35.400
And I'm gonna remind you of that.

19:39.740 --> 19:42.770
Hey! You got to sign that out!

19:42.820 --> 19:45.330
- So? How'd it go?
- Great.

19:46.830 --> 19:48.560
Dad! What are you doing?!

19:48.580 --> 19:50.620
What? I can't hear you!

19:50.630 --> 19:53.030
Oh, no! What are we gonna do?

19:53.070 --> 19:55.780
I guess I'll just have
to call the handyman.

19:56.700 --> 19:58.659
He's all thumbs and butt crack.

19:58.660 --> 20:00.090
Oh, then, what are we gonna do?

20:01.880 --> 20:03.040
You get the clamps.

20:03.080 --> 20:04.210
You get the nuts.

20:06.750 --> 20:08.580
And the Dermy for Father of the Year

20:08.600 --> 20:10.130
goes to Douglas Fogerty.

20:10.180 --> 20:12.050
Shut up, Will. Sit down.

20:12.090 --> 20:15.580
You're about to see
two geniuses at work.

20:15.640 --> 20:17.600
I just don't get it.

20:17.620 --> 20:19.120
Emma's a math genius?

20:19.130 --> 20:21.020
Last week, I caught you licking a brick.

20:21.070 --> 20:22.540
Don't knock it till you try it.

20:22.550 --> 20:24.900
Professor Sidney Raines.

20:24.940 --> 20:27.740
Lionel Richie. Rustic
Canyon Golf Course...

20:27.780 --> 20:29.740
your greens just play too fast.

20:29.780 --> 20:30.980
What is this list, again?

20:31.000 --> 20:32.020
His enemies.

20:32.040 --> 20:33.160
It's all over the map.

20:33.170 --> 20:35.340
What did the Budweiser
horses ever do to him?

20:35.400 --> 20:36.840
I knew you'd be back.

20:36.900 --> 20:39.200
Right on time for spring sweater season.

20:39.250 --> 20:40.820
Ooh! What's trending?

20:40.840 --> 20:42.820
One word... alpaca.

20:42.900 --> 20:45.600
Kids, this is supposed to be
about me right now, all right?

20:45.620 --> 20:47.790
It's not too late to add
some names to the list.

20:47.830 --> 20:49.800
All right, everybody. Let's
listen up. Here come the S's.

20:49.830 --> 20:51.380
Sam's Club.

20:51.430 --> 20:52.860
Santa Monica Boulevard,

20:52.900 --> 20:55.400
but only between 9:00
A.M. and 11:00 A.M.

20:55.440 --> 20:58.739
Siegfried and not Roy.
Roy, you are a peach.
