01:02.497 --> 01:04.455
This is my homework.

01:04.542 --> 01:06.240
I've spent every night this year

01:06.327 --> 01:08.111
cramming my skull
full of integral calculus

01:08.198 --> 01:09.634
and conversational Latin.

01:09.721 --> 01:10.679
I just needed one class

01:10.766 --> 01:12.115
that wasn't going to kill me.

01:12.202 --> 01:15.553
And then I saw it--
Music Appreciation.

01:15.640 --> 01:17.294
It's an actual class.

01:17.381 --> 01:18.339
All I have to do

01:18.426 --> 01:19.688
is listen to a CD

01:19.775 --> 01:21.864
and write down
how it makes me feel.

01:21.951 --> 01:23.474
It's such an easy "A."

01:23.561 --> 01:25.128
No matter how easy an "A" is,

01:25.215 --> 01:27.174
a "D" is always easier, Malcolm.

01:27.261 --> 01:28.523
Not in this class.

01:28.610 --> 01:30.568
I better get started
on my homework.

01:32.918 --> 01:35.878
[Albinoni's "Adagio for Organ
and Strings" plays]

01:39.490 --> 01:41.057
"F"!

01:41.144 --> 01:44.147
I can't believe that
goateed moron gave me an "F."

01:44.234 --> 01:46.280
"You obviously didn't even
listen to the piece."

01:46.367 --> 01:48.282
I listened to it.
You saw me.

01:48.369 --> 01:50.110
You know,
with the right kind of pen,

01:50.197 --> 01:53.374
you can turn that "F"
into a "P."

01:54.636 --> 01:56.116
Mom? Finally!

01:56.203 --> 01:58.161
Where have you been?

01:58.248 --> 01:59.597
I've been calling for weeks.

01:59.684 --> 02:01.077
I must have left ten messages.

02:01.164 --> 02:03.123
What on Earth
is going on up there?

02:03.210 --> 02:04.820
I'm busy.

02:04.907 --> 02:06.822
Gorga, Ludwina, and Marica

02:06.909 --> 02:09.955
need me to help make
pickles for the festival.

02:10.042 --> 02:10.955
Mom, what are you talking about?

02:11.043 --> 02:13.394
Gorga? Marica?

02:13.481 --> 02:14.873
Marica's Ludwina's cousin.

02:14.960 --> 02:16.962
She married the sailor
with the milky eye.

02:17.049 --> 02:19.443
And she knows
the curse to give you warts.

02:19.530 --> 02:20.966
You're not making any sense.

02:21.053 --> 02:22.403
I have to go.
They're calling me.

02:22.490 --> 02:25.232
Oh, my God, Hal.
She's lost her mind.

02:25.319 --> 02:26.668
She thinks she's back
in her old village.

02:26.755 --> 02:27.712
I have to go up there.

02:27.799 --> 02:29.149
Why?

02:29.236 --> 02:30.454
Hal, she has one leg,
she's demented.

02:30.541 --> 02:32.369
She could wander
out onto a freeway.

02:32.456 --> 02:33.849
I thought we agreed we'd take

02:33.936 --> 02:36.591
no extraordinary measures
to prolong her life.

02:36.678 --> 02:38.158
Fine.

02:39.507 --> 02:42.031
There we go.

02:42.118 --> 02:43.467
If Mommy asks, you got a bath.

02:43.554 --> 02:44.642
Psst!

02:45.948 --> 02:46.905
Did you get it?

02:46.992 --> 02:47.906
Oh, yeah.

02:47.993 --> 02:49.821
Exhumed Maniac.

02:49.908 --> 02:51.606
The guy at the video
store said it even

02:51.693 --> 02:52.955
creeped him out,
and he's an albino.

02:53.042 --> 02:54.478
Oh, I love
scary movies.

02:54.565 --> 02:56.480
There's nothing so
primal as a man coming

02:56.567 --> 02:58.439
face-to-face with what
really terrifies him.

02:58.526 --> 03:00.745
We'll keep this a secret
from your mother.

03:00.832 --> 03:02.312
Got it.

03:02.399 --> 03:03.879
There's commercials
she won't let me watch.

03:03.966 --> 03:05.837
Well, she's gone for five days.

03:05.924 --> 03:07.709
-We can have a film festival.
-Ha!

03:07.796 --> 03:09.406
Now, the thing about horror
films is that it's

03:09.493 --> 03:11.191
always what they don't
show that's scary,

03:11.278 --> 03:13.193
because nothing on
the screen can ever be

03:13.280 --> 03:14.977
as truly frightening
as what we imagin...

03:15.064 --> 03:18.241
[shrieking]

03:18.328 --> 03:21.375
[shrieking continues]

03:21.462 --> 03:22.854
I'm glad they shoved

03:22.941 --> 03:24.291
that guy's skin
down his throat.

03:24.378 --> 03:26.858
I didn't think he'd
ever stop screaming.

03:26.945 --> 03:28.860
[piano playing]

03:30.384 --> 03:32.864
I have a favor to ask.

03:32.951 --> 03:34.692
I'm taking
Music Appreciation,

03:34.779 --> 03:36.041
but I'm not doing so well.

03:36.128 --> 03:38.653
I have to get
an "A" in this class.

03:38.740 --> 03:40.437
I know you know
about this stuff,

03:40.524 --> 03:42.657
so I'm willing to pay you
ten bucks an hour to teach me

03:42.744 --> 03:44.224
until I get it right, okay?

03:44.311 --> 03:47.488
The "Adagio for Organ and
Strings" makes you happy?

03:47.575 --> 03:48.837
Are you going to help me or not?

03:48.924 --> 03:51.405
So let me get this straight.

03:51.492 --> 03:54.016
You, the brilliant
genius Malcolm,

03:54.103 --> 03:56.540
are coming to me,
your little brother,

03:56.627 --> 03:58.150
for help on your homework?

03:58.238 --> 03:59.848
Yes, Dewey, that's right.

03:59.935 --> 04:02.981
So you're
a total idiot at music?

04:03.068 --> 04:06.028
Yes, Dewey, it seems that way.

04:06.115 --> 04:10.075
Huh. That's probably why you're
such a drag to be around.

04:10.162 --> 04:14.166
Yes, Dewey, that's probably why
I'm such a drag to be around.

04:14.254 --> 04:15.820
Interesting.

04:15.907 --> 04:17.952
And that must be why
you're hitting yourself.

04:18.040 --> 04:19.171
Is this gonna take long?

04:19.259 --> 04:20.390
Depends how fast you obey.

04:21.435 --> 04:23.001
And that must be why

04:23.088 --> 04:24.176
you're hitting yourself.

04:29.443 --> 04:30.487
Mom.

04:30.574 --> 04:32.359
Oh, thank God
you're all right.

04:32.446 --> 04:34.012
What are you doing here?

04:34.099 --> 04:36.450
Mrs. Kucheck next door
told me you were down here.

04:36.537 --> 04:38.234
She also said
to stop stealing her newspaper.

04:38.321 --> 04:40.628
I told her she's free
to fight me for it.

04:40.715 --> 04:42.760
You didn't return
my calls for two weeks.

04:42.847 --> 04:43.587
I was worried.

04:43.674 --> 04:45.676
Oh, yes, so worried.

04:45.763 --> 04:48.418
You get the earrings,
Susan gets the bracelet.

04:48.505 --> 04:50.681
-Now go home.
-Mother...

04:50.768 --> 04:51.813
What is this place?

04:51.900 --> 04:53.162
It's wonderful.

04:53.249 --> 04:54.729
It's like being
back in the village.

04:54.816 --> 04:56.383
Everyone here
is from the old country.

04:56.470 --> 04:58.210
They got the right
kind of pickles.

04:58.298 --> 04:59.864
They know the old songs.

04:59.951 --> 05:02.258
After 50 years in this
stink-hole of a country,

05:02.345 --> 05:04.347
I finally feel like I fit in.

05:10.092 --> 05:13.138
Wow, I felt surrounded when
there was just one of you.

05:13.225 --> 05:14.836
You going to introduce her to us

05:14.923 --> 05:18.056
or make us wait around
like a pack of pigs?

05:18.143 --> 05:19.754
Pack of pigs wouldn't
leave their nail clippings

05:19.841 --> 05:21.930
on the floor for other
people to step on.

05:22.017 --> 05:23.192
This is my daughter, Lois.

05:23.279 --> 05:24.367
Gorga.

05:24.454 --> 05:25.455
Ludwina.

05:25.542 --> 05:26.935
Big Kathy. Little Kathy.

05:27.022 --> 05:30.547
Marica. Floransa.
Anca. And Mushka.

05:30.634 --> 05:33.115
Is this the fat daughter
or the one who drinks?

05:33.202 --> 05:35.117
This is the one with
the half-wit factory

05:35.204 --> 05:36.858
between her legs.

05:36.945 --> 05:38.250
[women chattering]

05:38.338 --> 05:39.991
Well, I don't know
what to say.

05:40.078 --> 05:42.690
I planned on two days to get
you into the old folks home,

05:42.777 --> 05:44.213
two days to fight
the court challenge,

05:44.300 --> 05:45.997
then I'd fly back on Sunday.

05:46.084 --> 05:49.000
Now I'm stuck here-- it's
$300 just to change my ticket.

05:49.087 --> 05:51.394
Good. You'll be here for
the festival Saturday.

05:51.481 --> 05:52.526
What festival?

05:54.397 --> 05:55.746
You stop it.

05:55.833 --> 05:58.358
You know
it's Saint Grotus's Day.

05:58.445 --> 06:00.055
Oh, my God.
Saint Grotus's Day?

06:00.142 --> 06:01.143
That's still around?

06:01.230 --> 06:03.058
It is. And we haven't

06:03.145 --> 06:05.887
turned our church
into a Burger King either.

06:05.974 --> 06:07.236
She's being modest.

06:07.323 --> 06:09.325
She was a terrific
Grotus Day dancer.

06:09.412 --> 06:11.806
Made your children look
like poisoned sheep.

06:11.893 --> 06:13.373
Best girl between the vlatnis

06:13.460 --> 06:16.376
-in 15 counties!
-Not the vlatnis.

06:16.463 --> 06:18.726
God, I hated that
awful vlatny dance.

06:18.813 --> 06:21.119
You loved it.
She begged to go.

06:21.206 --> 06:22.643
She dragged me
seven blocks

06:22.730 --> 06:24.819
by my pigtails to some
stinking butcher shop

06:24.906 --> 06:26.386
full of drunk uncles.

06:26.473 --> 06:27.735
I couldn't even see my feet
through the flies

06:27.822 --> 06:29.127
and the cigarette smoke.

06:29.214 --> 06:30.520
When I was 16,
I worked up the nerve

06:30.607 --> 06:31.956
to tell her
I wanted to quit.

06:32.043 --> 06:34.219
She fed me nothing but bark
for a week.

06:34.306 --> 06:36.831
It's her stupid
idea of a joke.

06:36.918 --> 06:38.615
You're not around
fancy big-shots

06:38.702 --> 06:40.965
with all their teeth,
sipping wine.

06:41.052 --> 06:42.489
These are real people.

06:42.576 --> 06:44.578
You will not embarrass me
in front of my friends

06:44.665 --> 06:46.536
by spitting on
who you are

06:46.623 --> 06:48.886
and where you come from.

06:48.973 --> 06:50.584
Fine.

06:52.063 --> 06:54.283
Oh. Boshnik bread.

06:54.370 --> 06:56.198
I haven't had this in years.

06:56.285 --> 06:58.243
Does it work,
or just cram

06:58.330 --> 06:59.593
its face with bread?

06:59.680 --> 07:00.942
She works.

07:01.029 --> 07:03.640
And not on her back
like your slut daughter.

07:03.727 --> 07:07.035
Can she make
a Saint Grotus's Day tart?

07:07.122 --> 07:08.732
I'd have left her in the forest

07:08.819 --> 07:11.561
with her hand
nailed to a stump if she didn't.

07:11.648 --> 07:14.346
You will make the tart
this year.

07:14.434 --> 07:17.524
The tart? By myself?
That thing is gigantic.

07:17.611 --> 07:20.004
Yes, let Ida's daughter rest.

07:20.091 --> 07:21.484
The old ladies
with arthritis

07:21.571 --> 07:24.835
can make
the Saint his tart.

07:24.922 --> 07:26.315
Ida's daughter can sit

07:26.402 --> 07:28.491
on her gigantic ass
all day and eat bread.

07:28.578 --> 07:30.841
-Jelly, dear?
-Fine.

07:30.928 --> 07:32.277
I'm here for five days.

07:32.364 --> 07:34.628
I was expecting to be
miserable anyway.

07:34.715 --> 07:35.759
I'll make the tart.

07:35.846 --> 07:37.892
We got it started for you.

07:46.335 --> 07:48.337
MAN: [on TV]
No! Not my eyes!

07:48.424 --> 07:49.425
[chuckling]

07:49.512 --> 07:51.993
Not my baby's eyes, too!

08:00.436 --> 08:02.786
-Hey, Dad.
-Aah! What do you want?!

08:03.874 --> 08:06.181
I wanted to trade
my Fruit Roll-Up

08:06.268 --> 08:07.748
for a strawberry one?

08:09.924 --> 08:11.316
Sorry, son.
Of course you can.

08:11.403 --> 08:12.753
But ask for it like a man.

08:12.840 --> 08:14.189
Don't go creeping
around the kitchen.

08:14.276 --> 08:16.539
I'll just come back later.
You seem busy.

08:18.367 --> 08:20.282
Hey, Dad.
Check out tonight's movie.

08:20.369 --> 08:23.459
"They Peeled My Face."

08:23.546 --> 08:25.505
The director went to jail
for using real corpses.

08:25.592 --> 08:28.595
Listen, Reese, I wanted
to talk about movie night.

08:28.682 --> 08:30.814
Really? I wasn't
going to say anything

08:30.901 --> 08:32.511
'cause it's so gay
to talk about feelings,

08:32.599 --> 08:33.730
but I used to feel bad

08:33.817 --> 08:35.645
that we don't
spend any time together.

08:36.645 --> 08:37.865
And now I find out

08:37.952 --> 08:39.214
that the one thing
I like the most,

08:39.301 --> 08:40.389
that everyone
else thinks is creepy,

08:40.476 --> 08:41.477
my dad likes it, too.

08:41.563 --> 08:42.522
How great is that?

08:42.609 --> 08:44.174
Really great.

08:59.147 --> 09:01.018
Does it have to be so hot?

09:01.105 --> 09:03.194
It's, like,
95 degrees in here.

09:03.281 --> 09:05.675
Yes, we'll turn on
the air-conditioning

09:05.762 --> 09:07.198
and let the tart

09:07.285 --> 09:09.592
collapse so you can
live like a movie star.

09:09.679 --> 09:11.115
Let's see how you did.

09:11.202 --> 09:12.813
No, it's not done yet.

09:12.900 --> 09:14.771
I was nine hours into it
when you made me start over

09:14.858 --> 09:16.860
because the almonds
weren't facing Vadutz.

09:16.947 --> 09:21.735
You made vomit.

09:21.822 --> 09:23.301
The Saint killed our enemies,

09:23.388 --> 09:25.086
then went to hell
to ask Jesus

09:25.173 --> 09:26.914
to increase the severity
of their punishment,

09:27.001 --> 09:29.264
and you reward
him with vomit?

09:29.351 --> 09:32.267
You might as well wipe
yourself with the beard

09:32.354 --> 09:33.964
of the Most Holy Patriarch.

09:34.051 --> 09:36.967
Why is my tart vomit?

09:37.054 --> 09:38.447
Stop your temper tantrum!

09:38.534 --> 09:40.057
Look here-- the 15th layer--

09:40.144 --> 09:41.885
you put apricots.

09:41.972 --> 09:43.974
Is that correct?

09:44.061 --> 09:47.195
The Saint didn't slaughter
the peacemakers on the 15th.

09:47.282 --> 09:50.111
He waited till the 16th
when they trusted him.

09:50.198 --> 09:52.243
This thing has,
like, 35 layers.

09:52.330 --> 09:54.332
Who's gonna know
where the apricots are?

09:54.419 --> 09:56.596
So if you steal
and no one knows,

09:56.683 --> 09:58.119
that makes it okay?

09:58.206 --> 09:59.424
I taught her better than that,

09:59.511 --> 10:01.644
till my arm
was going to fall off.

10:01.731 --> 10:02.863
She has to start over.

10:02.950 --> 10:05.300
What?
This is ridiculous.

10:07.650 --> 10:10.131
Don't blame yourself, Ida.

10:10.218 --> 10:11.741
She was born rotten.

10:11.828 --> 10:14.614
That's why the goat
refused to breast-feed her.

10:17.399 --> 10:19.531
Can I at least have a rag
to tie around my head

10:19.619 --> 10:20.968
to keep the sweat
out of my eyes?

10:21.055 --> 10:24.232
Yes, Your Majesty.

10:24.319 --> 10:25.625
WOMAN: How Ida must suffer.

10:25.712 --> 10:27.104
[mobile playing lullaby]

10:27.191 --> 10:28.845
We have to start from
the very beginning.

10:28.932 --> 10:30.107
What do you feel?

10:30.194 --> 10:32.153
I don't feel anything.

10:32.240 --> 10:34.546
It's just dinging,
and it's annoying.

10:34.634 --> 10:35.896
What the hell is wrong with you?

10:35.983 --> 10:37.898
Babies understand this music.

10:37.985 --> 10:40.030
I'll tell you
what's wrong with me.

10:40.117 --> 10:42.163
You're teaching me bad
on purpose.

10:42.250 --> 10:44.165
Great-- now you're
stupid and crazy.

10:44.252 --> 10:45.340
Am I?

10:45.427 --> 10:46.950
I asked to learn
the one thing

10:47.037 --> 10:48.517
that makes you special,
your stupid music,

10:48.604 --> 10:50.127
but you can't stand that,
can you?

10:50.214 --> 10:51.999
You've been
sabotaging me from day one.

10:52.086 --> 10:53.914
That's it. I quit.

10:54.001 --> 10:55.872
You can't!
You made a promise!

10:55.959 --> 10:56.830
I did not.

10:56.917 --> 10:58.005
We've tried everything

10:58.092 --> 10:59.441
and you're an idiot.

10:59.528 --> 11:01.748
You're not walking
away from this, Dewey.

11:01.835 --> 11:03.750
You're going to
help me beat this.

11:03.837 --> 11:05.708
I don't care.
Fail your course.

11:05.795 --> 11:07.536
I dropped that
class last week.

11:07.623 --> 11:09.712
Then why are you bothering me?

11:09.799 --> 11:12.323
Because you know music and
I don't and that's not fair!

11:12.410 --> 11:13.673
It's totally fair.

11:13.760 --> 11:15.413
You just hate
that you don't get

11:15.500 --> 11:17.851
to be better than everybody
at everything all the time.

11:17.938 --> 11:19.591
Music's my only thing.

11:19.679 --> 11:21.245
And you know what?

11:21.332 --> 11:23.247
It's greater than everything
you have put together,

11:23.334 --> 11:26.424
because it's about
beauty and love and feeling,

11:26.511 --> 11:28.557
and not about proving
what a creepy little genius

11:28.644 --> 11:31.516
you are to everybody,
so excuse me!

11:31.603 --> 11:33.562
I'm going to appreciate music.

11:33.649 --> 11:36.913
It's all the sweeter
because I know you can't.

11:38.828 --> 11:40.308
[Dewey screams]

11:41.265 --> 11:42.353
Oh, my God. Dewey.

11:42.440 --> 11:44.268
Are you okay?

11:44.355 --> 11:46.401
I'm sorry.

11:48.359 --> 11:51.362
I'm deaf. I'm deaf.

11:52.494 --> 11:54.409
Oh, my God.

11:54.496 --> 11:56.585
Mom's gonna kill us!

11:56.672 --> 11:58.500
Shut up. Calm down.
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

11:58.587 --> 12:00.763
Your hearing will probably
come back in a while.

12:00.850 --> 12:02.504
Please, just don't say
anything, okay?

12:02.591 --> 12:03.853
Let's just keep this
quiet for a while.

12:03.940 --> 12:05.159
Do you understand?

12:07.814 --> 12:08.989
Does a punch mean yes?

12:10.947 --> 12:12.819
Good.

12:16.126 --> 12:19.173
Well, I finished.

12:19.260 --> 12:21.871
I almost gave up when I
thought I burned the prunes.

12:21.958 --> 12:23.133
But then I fell
into this rhythm,

12:23.220 --> 12:24.395
and just lost track of time.

12:24.482 --> 12:26.354
Next thing you know,
it's done.

12:26.441 --> 12:28.051
And it came out perfect.

12:28.138 --> 12:29.749
It was a lot of work,

12:29.836 --> 12:32.186
but you know something?
It feels good.

12:36.320 --> 12:37.234
What's that?

12:37.321 --> 12:38.758
That's the real tart.

12:38.845 --> 12:40.629
You kept screwing up.

12:40.716 --> 12:43.153
We just knew it would be
easier for everyone

12:43.240 --> 12:44.894
if we just made it ourselves.

12:44.981 --> 12:47.114
But I worked for days!

12:47.201 --> 12:48.463
I'm sorry.

12:48.550 --> 12:50.944
I know you'd rather
be at the disco

12:51.031 --> 12:55.035
shaking your backside
at a bunch of drug addicts.

12:56.123 --> 12:59.474
You like St. Grotus's Day?!

12:59.561 --> 13:00.910
Huh?!

13:00.997 --> 13:02.042
You like tarts?!

13:03.043 --> 13:04.435
Well, what are we waiting for?

13:04.522 --> 13:06.394
Let's celebrate!

Well,

you'll think better

13:41.864 --> 13:46.129
before criticizing
other people's desserts.

13:56.531 --> 13:58.098
What are you doing?

13:58.185 --> 13:59.316
Oh, Malcolm.

13:59.403 --> 14:01.101
I didn't hear you.

14:01.188 --> 14:02.406
I wonder why.

14:02.493 --> 14:04.104
Why don't you have a seat?

14:07.194 --> 14:08.760
Now, I know some people

14:08.848 --> 14:10.719
say an eye for an eye
makes the whole world blind.

14:12.112 --> 14:14.723
But I think
it's simple fairness.

14:14.810 --> 14:15.637
I don't know what
you're talking about.

14:15.724 --> 14:17.378
Just say what you mean.

14:18.596 --> 14:20.163
You seem confused.

14:20.250 --> 14:21.686
You want me to help you?

14:23.993 --> 14:25.081
Well, let's see if

14:25.168 --> 14:27.692
I can make it loud and clear.

14:32.436 --> 14:33.263
I can't do it.

14:33.350 --> 14:34.525
I guess I'm just

14:34.612 --> 14:35.700
a better person than you are.

[air horn blaring]

14:44.753 --> 14:47.669
You know, there's some
diabetes medicine in the fridge

14:47.756 --> 14:49.323
you may want to destroy.

14:49.410 --> 14:51.238
I am not going to be
the bad guy in this, Mother.

14:51.325 --> 14:53.936
I just want to understand
my daughter's behavior.

14:54.023 --> 14:56.025
Why are you so frustrated?

14:56.112 --> 14:59.246
Is your husband failing
to perform his shameful duty?

14:59.333 --> 15:01.552
Mother, just shut up,
and leave me alone.

15:01.639 --> 15:03.903
After all the Saint did for us,

15:03.990 --> 15:05.948
all the enemy churches
he burned,

15:06.035 --> 15:08.777
why would you destroy
his holy cookie?

15:08.864 --> 15:10.518
It doesn't even taste good.

15:10.605 --> 15:12.041
It's not supposed to taste good.

15:12.128 --> 15:13.608
It's supposed
to be hard to make!

15:13.695 --> 15:15.436
I can't believe
you would humiliate me

15:15.523 --> 15:16.611
in front of my friends!

15:16.698 --> 15:17.829
Friends?

15:17.917 --> 15:19.135
Those women are monsters.

15:19.222 --> 15:20.658
They treat me like garbage.

15:20.745 --> 15:22.095
How can they be your friends?

15:22.182 --> 15:24.010
I need some people
I can talk to, Lois!

15:24.097 --> 15:26.012
Well, you used to need me!

15:28.797 --> 15:29.929
I'm going.

15:34.455 --> 15:37.458
[shouting]: All right.
So now we're both deaf,

15:37.545 --> 15:38.589
but that's okay.

15:38.676 --> 15:40.765
We've had a while
to practice now

15:40.852 --> 15:43.246
and we're pretty confident
we can hide it from Dad!

15:43.333 --> 15:45.422
Boys, listen,
I'm going to grab the TV

15:45.509 --> 15:47.294
and hide it
till your mother gets back.

I'm going to tell Reese
that it was stolen by junkies,

15:49.905 --> 15:51.515
desperate for a quick fix.

15:51.602 --> 15:52.734
If he ever suspects,

15:52.821 --> 15:54.214
you didn't hear it
from me. Oh!

15:57.173 --> 15:58.783
Hey, Dad.

15:58.870 --> 16:00.655
The guy at the video store
finally admitted

16:00.742 --> 16:02.439
they have a secret room
behind the snuff films.

16:02.526 --> 16:03.397
I'm going to go check it out.

16:05.007 --> 16:06.487
Sounds like a plan.

and the second corset.

All right.

You want to dance...

16:57.973 --> 16:59.801
we dance.

What are you doing?

17:03.196 --> 17:04.501
I'm not dancing in this thing.

Aw, crap.
I hate the knives.

18:56.526 --> 19:01.140
You think your dad getting
killed by a TV set is funny?!

19:01.227 --> 19:02.576
I'll tell you
what's funny!

19:02.663 --> 19:04.621
Being grounded
for the rest of your lives!

19:04.708 --> 19:06.232
After about an hour,

19:06.319 --> 19:08.190
he managed to spit a piece
of glass into my lap.

19:08.277 --> 19:10.453
You've got to admire
that kind of perseverance.

19:10.540 --> 19:12.847
Your children
and your children's children

19:12.934 --> 19:15.241
will grow up
grounded in this house!

19:15.328 --> 19:16.720
I can't hear what he's saying.

19:16.807 --> 19:18.331
But judging by the color
of his face,

19:18.418 --> 19:20.159
I probably shouldn't ask
for the car this weekend.

19:20.246 --> 19:21.943
Dad, come on. I've got
something to show you.

19:22.030 --> 19:23.031
[whimpers]

until Mom comes home,

then say it was defective,
and get a refund.

Tonight's going
to feel like we're

are torture for me.

spending time with you.

19:50.667 --> 19:53.104

19:53.192 --> 19:55.237
Like me and baseball.

19:55.324 --> 19:56.282
What?

Like when you were so excited

19:57.718 --> 19:59.546
to teach me baseball
when I was six,

19:59.633 --> 20:02.244
and I couldn't tell you
how totally boring it is.

But... that look on your face
when I got you your first mitt?

I get underwear for Christmas.

you read my mind!"

for a good cause.

20:22.482 --> 20:24.223
That's what I meant.

20:26.312 --> 20:27.313
Hi, Dewey.

20:27.400 --> 20:28.488
Mom.

20:28.575 --> 20:29.750
Your voice.

20:29.837 --> 20:31.099
Your beautiful voice!

20:31.186 --> 20:33.536
I can hear you!

20:34.885 --> 20:38.106
Well, it's nice
to see you too, honey.

20:38.193 --> 20:41.196
[birds chirping]

20:41.283 --> 20:44.112
Every morning those damn birds.

20:44.199 --> 20:45.505
They can't keep...

20:45.592 --> 20:48.551
Wait. I can hear!

20:52.425 --> 20:55.036
[Albinoni's "Adagio for Organ
and Strings" plays]

20:55.123 --> 20:56.603
I can hear.

20:56.690 --> 20:59.432
Oh, my God, I'm so happy.

20:59.519 --> 21:01.999
[music continues]
