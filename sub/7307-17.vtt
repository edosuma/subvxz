WEBVTT

00:24.248 --> 00:26.206
Come on, baby, let's get back out there.

00:26.292 --> 00:27.621
Hey!

01:46.940 --> 01:49.126
Kate, I've been meaning
to ask you something for a while.

01:49.150 --> 01:50.182
What's that?

01:50.277 --> 01:51.587
What do you do with your leftover cereal

01:51.611 --> 01:52.713
when there's not enough to eat

01:52.737 --> 01:54.006
but there's too much to throw away?

01:54.030 --> 01:55.633
'Cause I was having
Cap'n Crunch this morning...

01:55.657 --> 01:57.235
Tony, I'm really not in the mood today.

01:57.325 --> 01:59.484
Well, I was just trying
to take your mind off him.

01:59.578 --> 02:01.202
- Who?
- The one that got away.

02:01.288 --> 02:04.454
Tony, I'm not thinking
about that damn terrorist.

02:04.541 --> 02:05.703
Sorry.

02:05.792 --> 02:06.990
Look at Gibbs, okay?

02:07.085 --> 02:09.410
He's been growling
like a wounded bear since that night.

02:09.503 --> 02:12.126
Well, he is wounded,
and he always growls like a bear.

02:12.215 --> 02:14.527
It's his way of never letting anyone
know when he's hurting.

02:14.551 --> 02:17.468
- Yours is to be moody.
- I'm not moody!

02:17.554 --> 02:19.677
Well, what do you call it?

02:19.764 --> 02:21.757
I feel sorry for whatever his name is.

02:21.850 --> 02:23.309
- Sorry?
- Yeah.

02:23.393 --> 02:25.682
I wouldn't want Gibbs on my ass.

02:26.521 --> 02:30.186
- We're never gonna see that guy again.
- Maybe not. But Gibbs will.

02:31.610 --> 02:34.694
- Identification?
- Gibbs. NCIS.

02:34.946 --> 02:36.903
Right through here, sir.

02:36.990 --> 02:39.113
Kate, you ever been
in a men's room before?

02:39.200 --> 02:40.825
No. Have you?

02:45.665 --> 02:48.915
- Where've you been, Jethro?
- Someone knew his shortcut, Duck.

02:49.002 --> 02:51.078
G.W. Parkway was like
a parking lot this morning.

02:51.171 --> 02:52.998
I came on the G.W. Parkway

02:53.089 --> 02:56.458
after stopping at the hospital
to visit with Gerald.

02:56.801 --> 02:59.921
- How is he?
- He's gonna be in rehab for months.

03:00.013 --> 03:02.504
I want that terrorist on my table, Jethro.

03:03.725 --> 03:05.184
- Kate?
- Photos.

03:05.268 --> 03:06.644
- Tony?
- Laser sketch.

03:06.728 --> 03:10.346
- Talk to me about this case, Ducky.
- It's an odd one.

03:10.857 --> 03:15.353
Yes, our young friend here
expired at approximately 1:00 a.m.

03:15.445 --> 03:16.608
Do we have an I. D?

03:16.696 --> 03:19.318
Yeah, Petty Officer First Class
Chris Gordon.

03:19.407 --> 03:22.194
He's a S.K. Stationed at Pax River.

03:23.703 --> 03:26.538
All this happened
from him falling out of the ceiling?

03:26.623 --> 03:30.241
Hardly. He suffered
multiple traumatic injuries.

03:30.335 --> 03:33.953
His fall through the ceiling
only added insult to injury.

03:34.047 --> 03:35.790
Still waiting for the odd part.

03:35.882 --> 03:38.587
Someone dressed him
after he was killed.

03:39.010 --> 03:40.255
That's odd.

03:40.345 --> 03:43.215
Well, I'll know more
when I get him on the table.

03:43.306 --> 03:46.509
- What'd you find there?
- Safety glass, I think.

03:47.060 --> 03:49.895
- Did you find his cell phone?
- What makes you think he had one?

03:49.980 --> 03:52.221
Scrape marks on his belt
where he carried it.

03:52.315 --> 03:54.557
No. No cell phone.

03:54.651 --> 03:56.774
One obvious question, Duck.

03:57.988 --> 04:01.191
How did Petty Officer Gordon
end up in the basement ceiling?

04:09.207 --> 04:10.452
Blood.

04:10.542 --> 04:12.382
There's a trail
leading out to the parking lot.

04:14.629 --> 04:17.416
- What about inside the door?
- We'll get there.

04:17.923 --> 04:20.878
Tony, do a 100-metre perimeter search.

04:20.969 --> 04:22.926
Kate, you keep snapping.

04:29.769 --> 04:31.809
Hey, boss, check this out.

04:33.940 --> 04:35.019
Brake marks.

04:35.108 --> 04:36.919
That's what I thought
when I was first walking up.

04:36.943 --> 04:38.402
But if they were brake marks,

04:38.486 --> 04:41.156
they'd start out light
and gradually darken.

04:41.239 --> 04:43.148
Front-wheel drive. He was accelerating.

04:43.241 --> 04:45.779
It looks like somebody
ran over Petty Officer Gordon

04:45.869 --> 04:47.945
when he came out of the club,
then hid his body.

04:48.038 --> 04:49.366
And nobody saw it?

04:50.123 --> 04:52.116
At least one person did.

04:52.459 --> 04:54.119
Whoever ran him down.

04:54.210 --> 04:55.788
Preserve this area for evidence.

04:57.297 --> 04:59.455
Where's the guy
who runs this nightclub?

04:59.549 --> 05:02.254
We took his statement, then let him go.

05:03.053 --> 05:05.294
Are you in the habit
of letting material witnesses go

05:05.388 --> 05:07.096
before they talk to investigators?

05:07.182 --> 05:08.759
He had to leave.

05:09.225 --> 05:10.850
Why did he have to leave?

05:20.153 --> 05:22.110
- Darin Spotnitz?
- Maybe.

05:22.989 --> 05:27.117
- How about now?
- Definitely.

05:27.202 --> 05:28.826
Special Agent Gibbs, NCIS.

05:28.912 --> 05:31.829
Special Agent Todd,
Special Agent DiNozzo.

05:32.165 --> 05:35.450
- What's NCIS?
- Naval Criminal Investigative Service.

05:36.044 --> 05:38.499
- Is this about last night?
- It is.

05:38.588 --> 05:40.379
Look, I already told the police all I know.

05:40.465 --> 05:41.840
Then tell us.

05:41.925 --> 05:44.463
I didn't see anything.
Don't know nothing.

05:44.552 --> 05:46.711
Let me guess, Honours English?

05:47.180 --> 05:48.259
Recognise him?

05:48.348 --> 05:50.720
Come on, there were,
like, 537 people there last night.

05:50.809 --> 05:52.089
You didn't answer my question.

05:53.853 --> 05:56.640
No, I don't recognise him.
I wasn't working the door.

05:56.731 --> 05:59.020
- Who was?
- Antwane.

05:59.943 --> 06:02.813
- Does Antwane have a last name?
- Mann.

06:03.321 --> 06:04.780
Oh, with two "n's".

06:04.864 --> 06:07.616
How do we find Antwane Mann
with two "n's"?

06:11.538 --> 06:12.783
Nice PDA.

06:13.498 --> 06:15.455
Actually, it's a Motorola A388.

06:15.542 --> 06:18.543
It's a PDA plus cell phone
and internet connection.

06:18.628 --> 06:20.523
Here's his home number,
cell number, business number

06:20.547 --> 06:22.171
fax number and address.

06:23.591 --> 06:24.706
Kate.

06:25.635 --> 06:26.750
Right.

06:27.720 --> 06:30.840
- You want me to beam it to you?
- Sure.

06:32.725 --> 06:36.260
- How old are you?
- Eighteen.

06:39.899 --> 06:41.275
Seventeen.

06:43.403 --> 06:44.517
In two months.

06:44.612 --> 06:46.404
You run this moving nightclub
by yourself?

06:46.489 --> 06:47.520
That's right.

06:47.615 --> 06:50.256
- Do you have any employees?
- Well, I hire them as subcontractors.

06:50.285 --> 06:52.858
That way they're responsible for 100%
of the FICA and Medicare.

06:52.954 --> 06:54.765
- Not just half.
- I'm sure they appreciate that.

06:54.789 --> 06:56.950
Yeah, well, any business school
professor will tell you

06:57.041 --> 06:59.615
that the objective of any company
is to motivate your employees

06:59.711 --> 07:01.834
so that they provide
superior goods and services.

07:01.921 --> 07:04.839
That's why professors
rarely ever succeed in business.

07:04.924 --> 07:06.253
But you do.

07:06.551 --> 07:09.220
Yeah. I have no fixed costs.
My direct costs are controllable.

07:09.304 --> 07:12.637
My purchases are 210, net 30.
My break-even is 212 people.

07:12.724 --> 07:15.393
My shots are dispensed by a machine
to prevent any free drinks,

07:15.476 --> 07:18.237
and I have internal controls
to insure that all cash is accounted for.

07:18.730 --> 07:20.603
What's the deal with your hair?

07:20.690 --> 07:22.647
How do you think
a guy from Lexington Park

07:22.734 --> 07:25.735
ends up an hour away
at a party in Alexandria?

07:26.988 --> 07:28.981
It's easy. It's a Darin Spotnitz party.

07:29.073 --> 07:31.399
Put a name brand on it,
you know it's a name brand.

07:31.492 --> 07:35.027
I mean, no one ever thought to put
a brand name on a party till I did it.

07:36.372 --> 07:39.077
- Sorry. I should take this.
- I wouldn't.

07:40.293 --> 07:42.202
Or they can just leave a message.

07:42.295 --> 07:44.916
So what exactly does
a Darin Spotnitz party mean?

07:45.757 --> 07:49.126
Killer music, great drinks,
and hottie factor off the charts.

07:49.219 --> 07:50.926
How do we get in touch with you?

07:57.101 --> 07:58.928
Are you gonna tell
my parents about this?

07:59.020 --> 08:00.598
They don't know?

08:00.688 --> 08:04.140
Well, it's kind of illegal
for me to be in a nightclub.

08:08.029 --> 08:12.525
So if his break-even is 212 people
and he had 537...

08:12.617 --> 08:13.780
$25 a head.

08:13.868 --> 08:15.327
That means that he cleared

08:15.411 --> 08:19.112
$8,125

08:19.374 --> 08:20.868
in one night.

08:22.460 --> 08:24.785
I should've majored in business.

08:30.468 --> 08:32.840
Petty Officer Gordon's quarters
are around the corner,

08:32.929 --> 08:34.256
second door on the right.

08:51.489 --> 08:53.149
Somebody tossed this place.

08:53.866 --> 08:56.571
- How can you tell?
- Furniture indentations on the carpet.

08:56.661 --> 08:59.282
No fingerprints or smudges
on the icebox or the microwave.

08:59.372 --> 09:01.080
No sign of forced entry.

09:01.165 --> 09:02.873
Who would have access to his room?

09:02.959 --> 09:05.082
- The guy he shares a head with.
- Or his C.O.

09:05.169 --> 09:06.480
How do you know
he shares a bathroom?

09:06.504 --> 09:08.107
E5 and below,
you have up to four roommates.

09:08.131 --> 09:09.162
You share a head.

09:09.257 --> 09:11.214
E6, you get your own space,
but you share a head.

09:11.301 --> 09:12.380
E7, own room, own head.

09:12.468 --> 09:14.544
- Like a sorority.
- Yeah.

09:14.721 --> 09:17.722
- Wonder what they were looking for?
- I wonder if they found it?

09:17.807 --> 09:20.843
I wonder when you two guys
are gonna stop yakking and get to work.

09:29.068 --> 09:31.227
Looks like the guy was burning DVD's.

09:31.321 --> 09:33.812
That reminds me, I gotta return Gigli.
It's a week overdue.

09:37.577 --> 09:39.486
Apparently he was immune to germs.

09:41.831 --> 09:43.740
This guy was way into reality shows.

09:43.833 --> 09:45.790
Real World, Simple Life, Punk'd.

09:45.877 --> 09:46.908
Punk'd?

09:47.003 --> 09:48.794
Jeez, Gibbs.
Even I know what Punk'd is.

09:48.880 --> 09:51.715
Punk'd is an MTV show
where they play tricks on celebrities

09:51.799 --> 09:53.294
while secretly filming it.

09:53.384 --> 09:55.922
- Like Candid Camera.
- What's Candid Camera?

09:59.766 --> 10:01.426
What is it, boss?

10:06.564 --> 10:08.604
Funny thing about stereos,

10:09.609 --> 10:13.357
you can't hear the music
unless the speakers are connected.

10:29.195 --> 10:32.398
$40,000. All 100s. Non-sequential.

10:32.490 --> 10:33.925
Now we know
what they were looking for.

10:33.949 --> 10:34.981
And didn't find.

10:35.075 --> 10:37.780
$40,000 seems like
a pretty good motive for murder.

10:37.870 --> 10:41.405
How does an E6 Petty Officer
making $2,310 a month

10:41.499 --> 10:43.657
manage to squirrel away
$40,000 in cash?

10:43.751 --> 10:44.865
Good question.

10:44.960 --> 10:47.748
I'm guessing
it's not because he's frugal.

10:59.517 --> 11:02.008
- Can I help you?
- Master Chief, NCIS.

11:02.102 --> 11:03.645
You got a minute?

11:03.729 --> 11:06.849
- Is this about Petty Officer Gordon?
- It is.

11:09.318 --> 11:11.109
Keep your eyes open.

11:11.195 --> 11:13.353
These guys drive like
they're at Indianapolis.

11:13.447 --> 11:15.855
You were
Petty Officer Gordon's Section Chief.

11:15.950 --> 11:17.776
- Yes, sir.
- Good worker?

11:18.911 --> 11:20.453
He was one of the best.

11:20.538 --> 11:22.329
He was a bit of a practical joker.

11:22.414 --> 11:25.036
I occasionally had to remind him
of the time and the place.

11:25.125 --> 11:27.367
- He get along well with his mates?
- Oh, yeah.

11:27.461 --> 11:30.332
There were four guys in particular
he was in tight with.

11:30.422 --> 11:31.965
I called them the five musketeers.

11:32.049 --> 11:34.967
- Are they here?
- No, they work the 16 shift.

11:35.219 --> 11:38.718
We looked over Gordon's quarters,
found $40,000 in cash.

11:41.058 --> 11:43.763
Any idea where he could've got
that kind of money?

11:44.395 --> 11:45.557
No, sir.

11:46.480 --> 11:47.939
Master Chief,

11:48.190 --> 11:50.942
according to your records,
you've been here 10 years.

11:51.026 --> 11:53.778
I'm sure you know what goes on
at this base more than most.

11:53.863 --> 11:54.977
That's correct, sir.

11:55.072 --> 11:57.278
If you had to come up with a way
that an E6

11:57.366 --> 12:00.569
- could accumulate that kind of money...
- Drugs, maybe.

12:00.661 --> 12:04.244
Although I'd bet my last dollar
that Chris wasn't involved with drugs.

12:04.331 --> 12:06.371
I don't suspect gambling neither.

12:06.458 --> 12:11.002
- You don't think sailors gamble?
- Sure they gamble, but it's dollar-ante.

12:11.088 --> 12:14.422
If there was a regular big game,
I'd know about it, ma'am.

12:14.508 --> 12:18.292
Gordon was in supply.
Any chance he was getting kickbacks?

12:18.429 --> 12:19.460
No chance at all.

12:19.555 --> 12:20.907
He wasn't high enough
up the food chain

12:20.931 --> 12:23.422
to influence who got contracts
or what was purchased.

12:23.517 --> 12:26.055
He'd have to be at what, your level?

12:28.230 --> 12:29.475
Yes, sir.

12:33.360 --> 12:35.686
Gibbs wasn't real subtle
with that kickback comment.

12:35.779 --> 12:37.523
Wasn't trying to be.

12:50.169 --> 12:51.912
Ducky, you got
some good news for me?

12:52.004 --> 12:55.088
Well, it depends
on your definition of good news.

12:55.174 --> 12:56.798
Not the answer I was looking for.

12:56.884 --> 12:59.339
It seems the more I delve
into our young friend here,

12:59.428 --> 13:01.919
the more bewildered I become.

13:02.097 --> 13:03.408
It's usually the other way around.

13:03.432 --> 13:06.967
Yeah, Petty Officer Gordon
had multiple lower leg fractures,

13:07.061 --> 13:08.555
tibia, fibia.

13:08.771 --> 13:11.890
Here. Massive abdominal bruising
and echymosis

13:11.982 --> 13:14.652
and a subdural haematoma
from a skull fracture.

13:14.735 --> 13:17.570
- Consistent with being hit by a car?
- Entirely.

13:17.655 --> 13:19.674
So that's pretty straightforward.
What's the mystery?

13:19.698 --> 13:21.655
There was a white substance
on his hands.

13:21.742 --> 13:22.905
I sent it up to Abby.

13:22.993 --> 13:25.567
I could venture a guess
as to what it might be.

13:25.663 --> 13:27.157
Sure. Venture away.

13:27.581 --> 13:28.744
Baby powder.

13:28.832 --> 13:31.153
Powder? Was this powder applied
or from incidental contact?

13:31.210 --> 13:32.621
Most definitely applied.

13:32.711 --> 13:34.834
- Why?
- I haven't the faintest idea.

13:34.922 --> 13:36.713
And that's not all.

13:36.882 --> 13:40.465
This sliver of safety glass
is one of many

13:40.594 --> 13:42.717
I extracted from his skull.

13:42.972 --> 13:46.340
- What's that stuck to the tip?
- Latex, I believe.

13:46.475 --> 13:48.633
Abby will be able to confirm.

13:49.395 --> 13:53.772
But the latex was between the glass
and his skull.

13:54.066 --> 13:57.233
Meaning he was wearing something
rubber on his head when he was hit?

13:57.319 --> 14:00.688
Yet, we know someone dressed him
after he was killed,

14:00.823 --> 14:04.274
based on the condition of his clothes
and the bloodstain patterns.

14:04.368 --> 14:06.195
I can see why you're confused, Duck.

14:08.622 --> 14:10.200
It's grey latex.

14:10.457 --> 14:12.366
- Rubber?
- One and the same.

14:12.459 --> 14:14.748
Probably couldn't be used as a hat.

14:14.837 --> 14:16.960
Yeah, well,
not if you grew up in Dorkville.

14:17.047 --> 14:18.506
I grew up just west of there.

14:19.717 --> 14:22.089
Latex is, um,
very popular in certain circles.

14:22.177 --> 14:25.381
- Yeah? What kind of circles?
- Oh, hey, Gibbs.

14:25.472 --> 14:27.050
I don't know if you're ready for this.

14:27.141 --> 14:28.932
It might upset your delicate sensibilities.

14:29.018 --> 14:31.224
- I'll stop you.
- Okay.

14:31.645 --> 14:36.390
Maybe he was wearing a latex hood.
Like bondage gear, S&M, fetish...

14:38.694 --> 14:40.022
I dated this guy once

14:40.112 --> 14:42.318
who just wanted me to bounce
up and down on a balloon...

14:42.406 --> 14:43.817
Okay, stop.

14:44.324 --> 14:46.531
Gibbs, that is no weirder

14:46.827 --> 14:49.318
than a 350-pound guy

14:49.413 --> 14:52.580
with half his body painted yellow
and the other half painted green,

14:52.666 --> 14:54.507
wearing nothing but shorts
in 10-degree weather

14:54.585 --> 14:57.420
and a big plastic piece of cheese
on his head saying, "Go, Packers!"

14:57.504 --> 14:59.711
Ab, that's apples and oranges.

14:59.923 --> 15:02.212
There's a fetish for that, too.

15:02.676 --> 15:05.843
- What do you got?
- I matched the tyre track.

15:05.929 --> 15:09.215
Turns out it's not real popular,
but not terribly unpopular.

15:09.308 --> 15:11.799
Kind of like
my little brother in high school.

15:12.394 --> 15:14.683
Those are the five cars
that come equipped with that tyre.

15:14.772 --> 15:15.851
Next.

15:16.273 --> 15:18.515
All the blood samples
from the bathroom,

15:18.609 --> 15:22.689
the parking lot, the ceiling, the stairs,
were all from the victim.

15:23.322 --> 15:27.070
No drugs.
And the blood alcohol level was 0.10.

15:27.159 --> 15:28.238
Legally drunk.

15:28.327 --> 15:30.569
In all 50 states
including the District of Columbia.

15:30.662 --> 15:33.303
That might explain how he ended up
where he did in the parking lot.

15:33.373 --> 15:34.405
Been there, done that.

15:34.500 --> 15:35.769
What about the stuff
he had on his hands?

15:35.793 --> 15:36.824
Baby powder.

15:36.919 --> 15:38.911
- Any ideas why?
- I don't know.

15:39.004 --> 15:41.673
Guys have all kinds of strange rituals
before they go out.

15:41.757 --> 15:44.509
This one guy,
he does a full upper body workout

15:44.593 --> 15:47.001
just seconds before his date
so he can be all pumped.

15:47.096 --> 15:51.045
- Does Tony know that you know?
- Does Tony know that you know?

15:52.351 --> 15:54.676
You know, maybe it came from the car.

15:54.770 --> 15:57.177
- The baby powder?
- No, the latex.

15:57.272 --> 16:00.060
Latex has a lot
of commercial applications.

16:00.150 --> 16:01.977
I'm having a computer programme
e-mailed to me

16:02.069 --> 16:04.192
that'll recreate the accident
based on the injuries.

16:04.279 --> 16:07.114
- It'll give me a better idea.
- Let me know.

16:07.282 --> 16:10.616
Hey, Gibbs, do you have any fetishes?

16:11.370 --> 16:13.161
I got three ex-wives.

16:13.247 --> 16:14.789
I can't afford fetishes.

16:16.875 --> 16:20.209
- Tony, are you a GS-9 or a GS-11?
- I can't tell you.

16:20.796 --> 16:21.910
Why not?

16:22.005 --> 16:24.045
Because if I do,
you'll know how much money I make.

16:24.133 --> 16:26.339
- So?
- That's personal and confidential.

16:26.844 --> 16:28.338
I'm sorry,

16:28.428 --> 16:31.844
you give me
every single detail about your dates.

16:31.932 --> 16:35.218
- You leave out nothing.
- That's bragging. Money's personal.

16:35.352 --> 16:36.763
It's 1520.

16:38.147 --> 16:39.261
We're quitting early?

16:40.816 --> 16:42.191
We're going to Pax River.

16:42.276 --> 16:44.945
To pick up Gordon's buddies
who come on at 1600.

16:45.028 --> 16:46.571
The four musketeers.

16:50.159 --> 16:51.736
We drove to the club

16:51.827 --> 16:54.318
after hearing about it
from a guy on the Eisenhower, sir.

16:54.413 --> 16:56.037
Why all the way to Alexandria?

16:56.123 --> 16:58.614
We were bored
with the clubs around Lexington Park.

16:58.709 --> 16:59.989
We knew everyone there

17:00.085 --> 17:02.125
and we wanted to meet
some new people.

17:02.212 --> 17:06.755
Plus we heard this guy Darin Spotnitz
threw some awesome parties.

17:07.925 --> 17:09.634
How'd you get there?

17:09.720 --> 17:11.000
I drove.

17:11.305 --> 17:15.137
- You only take one car?
- Yes, sir. We got there around 11:00.

17:15.434 --> 17:17.058
Okay, then what?

17:17.144 --> 17:20.560
We paid our $25, went inside,
did a lap around the place,

17:20.771 --> 17:22.396
had a few drinks.

17:22.608 --> 17:25.098
Petty Officer Gordon
was with you the whole time?

17:25.194 --> 17:26.688
Until he met a babe.

17:26.778 --> 17:29.269
- You know her name?
- No, sir. Sorry.

17:30.657 --> 17:34.026
- She and Gordon hit it off, huh?
- Oh, yeah.

17:34.912 --> 17:38.744
- What time did he leave?
- Around midnight, with the girl.

17:39.249 --> 17:41.123
I figured he just went home with her.

17:41.210 --> 17:43.665
And you were headed for Pax River.

17:44.004 --> 17:46.709
Our deal was if one of us got lucky,

17:46.798 --> 17:50.049
he was on his own
in terms of getting back to base.

17:50.302 --> 17:52.591
- That happen often?
- Not really.

18:04.816 --> 18:07.770
We found $40,000 cash
in Gordon's room.

18:08.278 --> 18:10.603
$40,000? You're kidding.

18:10.906 --> 18:13.148
Any idea where he got all that money?

18:13.825 --> 18:15.106
No, sir.

18:15.577 --> 18:16.953
What kind of car you drive?

18:17.037 --> 18:18.116
Audi A6.

18:18.205 --> 18:19.284
350Z.

18:19.373 --> 18:20.487
Escalade.

18:20.582 --> 18:21.745
Taurus.

18:21.959 --> 18:25.826
Taurus is one of the five cars
that uses the tyre.

18:26.129 --> 18:27.244
Two years now.

18:30.592 --> 18:31.707
Your car on base?

18:31.802 --> 18:33.794
It was. I loaned it to my brother
a few days ago.

18:35.305 --> 18:36.799
Where is he?

18:36.890 --> 18:39.808
On his way to Phoenix
to visit a girl he met on the Internet.

18:42.646 --> 18:44.270
A bunch of guys go to a club,

18:44.356 --> 18:45.934
one of them meets a woman
and leaves,

18:46.024 --> 18:47.768
then turns up dead.

18:47.859 --> 18:50.564
- Their stories are pretty consistent.
- A little too consistent.

18:50.654 --> 18:53.134
- Do you think they're lying?
- I think they're well-rehearsed.

18:53.198 --> 18:54.425
But if that's what really happened

18:54.449 --> 18:55.551
and they're telling the truth,

18:55.575 --> 18:56.803
then their stories should match.

18:56.827 --> 18:59.946
They all gave a consistent description
of the mystery woman.

19:00.163 --> 19:03.449
Eyewitness accounts
always widely vary.

19:03.542 --> 19:05.333
These guys are in the military, Gibbs,

19:05.419 --> 19:07.127
so you'd expect
more accuracy from them

19:07.212 --> 19:08.587
than you would the general public.

19:08.672 --> 19:10.546
They're storekeepers,
Kate, they're not SEALs.

19:10.632 --> 19:13.966
We know what happened to Gordon.
What happened to the girl?

19:14.052 --> 19:17.137
We have no name,
and the description was basically,

19:17.222 --> 19:18.385
"She's super-hot."

19:18.473 --> 19:20.133
So it doesn't narrow it down much.

19:20.225 --> 19:22.514
Except for Wong,
for Second-Class Petty Officers,

19:22.602 --> 19:24.145
those guys have some pricey rides.

19:24.229 --> 19:26.387
Put out an APB on Wong's Taurus,

19:26.481 --> 19:30.230
and talk to Antwane Mann, two "n's".

19:39.494 --> 19:41.037
What can I do for you, brother?

19:41.121 --> 19:43.956
Haircut? Manicure? Waxing?

19:44.041 --> 19:46.164
Definitely not a waxing.
How about you, Kate?

19:46.918 --> 19:50.786
I'm special Agent Todd, NCIS.
This is Special Agent DiNozzo.

19:50.881 --> 19:52.209
Are you Antwane Mann?

19:52.758 --> 19:54.750
Proprietor of Soul Clips.

19:55.093 --> 19:56.256
Kind of ironic.

19:56.345 --> 19:58.918
- What's that?
- You own a hair salon and you're bald.

19:59.014 --> 20:01.006
- I'm not bald.
- You're taller than your hair.

20:02.684 --> 20:04.309
I shave my head.

20:05.687 --> 20:07.016
It just seems redundant.

20:08.148 --> 20:10.354
We understand that you were working
the door last night

20:10.442 --> 20:12.351
- at the Darin Spotnitz party.
- That's right.

20:12.444 --> 20:15.694
My man, Darin.
The boy knows how to throw a party.

20:15.781 --> 20:19.315
So you work as a bouncer
and you own this business?

20:19.409 --> 20:23.359
Hey, I don't plan on working forever.
I wanna retire at 50.

20:23.955 --> 20:27.371
- How are you gonna do that?
- By investing.

20:27.584 --> 20:29.162
Really. In what?

20:29.544 --> 20:31.917
- Kate, the pictures.
- Oh, right.

20:32.506 --> 20:33.786
I wanna show you a few pictures.

20:33.882 --> 20:36.110
See if you remember any of them
from the club last night.

20:36.134 --> 20:39.337
That's a waste of time.
I mean, there were over 500...

20:41.390 --> 20:43.181
Hey, I remember him.

20:43.683 --> 20:45.094
I notice people's hair.

20:45.185 --> 20:48.056
You know, him and his buddies
were the only ones had cuts like that.

20:49.356 --> 20:51.183
Are these the buddies
that were with him?

20:51.274 --> 20:52.437
Yep.

20:52.859 --> 20:56.109
- Do you remember what time he left?
- He didn't.

20:56.863 --> 20:59.022
He came in the club around 11:00.

20:59.116 --> 21:01.192
They found him dead a few hours later.

21:02.202 --> 21:05.369
So he didn't leave
with a woman around midnight?

21:05.455 --> 21:06.534
No.

21:08.875 --> 21:10.251
But he did.

21:19.711 --> 21:22.546
Why would all four lie
about who left with the woman?

21:22.631 --> 21:23.829
To protect Wong.

21:23.923 --> 21:26.165
- Or the woman.
- Or themselves.

21:26.259 --> 21:27.540
From what?

21:27.636 --> 21:31.170
That is the $40,000 question.
We're missing something.

21:31.723 --> 21:33.265
The evidence doesn't make sense.

21:33.350 --> 21:36.765
Haven't you already run every known
terrorist through this programme?

21:36.853 --> 21:38.644
I'm running it again.

21:39.939 --> 21:42.228
We know Gordon was
purposely run down in the parking lot,

21:42.317 --> 21:44.191
probably died from a fractured skull,

21:44.277 --> 21:47.313
and somebody hid his body
in the warehouse ceiling.

21:47.405 --> 21:50.691
From the $40,000 we found hidden
in his room gives someone a motive.

21:51.534 --> 21:52.779
A motive.

21:52.869 --> 21:55.442
For who? For what?
I mean, nothing ties him to the money.

21:56.039 --> 21:57.414
Do you want us to bring in Wong?

21:57.499 --> 22:00.168
Nope. Not until we know
where that $40,000 came from.

22:00.919 --> 22:02.199
What do we do?

22:02.295 --> 22:05.794
Same thing Deep Throat told
Woodward and Bernstein.

22:05.965 --> 22:07.590
Follow the money.

22:13.139 --> 22:14.764
Something's bugging me
about the money.

22:15.433 --> 22:17.225
It's not just $40,000 in cash.

22:17.310 --> 22:20.181
It's $40,000
in non-sequential $100 bills.

22:20.605 --> 22:22.930
- So?
- Well, why all hundreds?

22:23.274 --> 22:24.995
If it was drugs
it wouldn't be all hundreds.

22:25.026 --> 22:27.600
- Or gambling, or even theft.
- You're right.

22:27.696 --> 22:29.439
Where would you go
to get all hundreds?

22:29.531 --> 22:30.645
Bank.

22:31.908 --> 22:35.573
And what makes you go to a bank
requesting non-sequential $100 bills?

22:36.121 --> 22:38.244
- Ransom?
- Blackmail?

22:38.331 --> 22:40.454
Blackmail's good.
Who's he blackmailing?

22:42.293 --> 22:43.871
I have no idea.

22:46.756 --> 22:48.500
This programme rocks.

22:49.676 --> 22:52.214
It includes vault, fall, yaw, tip-over,

22:52.303 --> 22:54.261
rollover, combined speed,
linear momentum...

22:54.347 --> 22:55.426
Abby.

22:56.433 --> 22:59.932
Oh, come on, Gibbs.
You know you love it when I talk tech.

23:00.019 --> 23:01.264
What do you got?

23:01.354 --> 23:04.889
Well, at first I thought the latex
might have come from the car.

23:06.609 --> 23:09.776
But the latex primer used in the car
is located in the undercarriage

23:09.863 --> 23:11.143
which he never hit.

23:11.239 --> 23:13.362
So he had to have been
wearing the latex.

23:13.450 --> 23:16.450
- I already knew that.
- Yes, but that was speculation.

23:16.536 --> 23:18.612
- This is confirmation.
- Okay.

23:19.330 --> 23:20.659
What else?

23:20.749 --> 23:23.619
I used the victim's measurements
and the location of his injuries

23:23.710 --> 23:26.960
to determine the height of the vehicle
based on point of impact.

23:29.299 --> 23:32.833
And then I used a database
for vehicle grill dimensions.

23:33.136 --> 23:37.264
Can you believe someone put together
a database of vehicle grill dimensions?

23:37.348 --> 23:39.222
I was about to call Ripley's.

23:39.309 --> 23:41.467
I had this boyfriend once,
not the balloon guy,

23:41.561 --> 23:43.304
but this one was like a computer genius.

23:43.396 --> 23:45.804
He put together
a database of databases.

23:45.899 --> 23:48.169
I mean, it seems obvious in retrospect,
like the Pet Rock.

23:48.193 --> 23:49.568
- Abby.
- Yes?

23:49.652 --> 23:52.322
You're spending too much time
talking to Ducky.

23:52.405 --> 23:53.947
Okay, bottom line.

23:54.032 --> 23:56.653
The car that hit Gordon
was definitely a Taurus.

23:56.743 --> 23:58.985
- You're positive?
- Absolutely.

23:59.829 --> 24:02.320
Unless it was a Mercury Sable.

24:07.837 --> 24:10.672
- You find something interesting?
- Pre-paid phone card.

24:11.382 --> 24:13.671
Why would you have
a pre-paid phone card

24:13.760 --> 24:15.752
if you have a cell phone?

24:15.970 --> 24:19.719
Well, I can think of one reason.
Phone cards are impossible to trace.

24:19.808 --> 24:22.215
Unless you physically have the card.

24:22.310 --> 24:24.018
So you think maybe
he used his phone card

24:24.103 --> 24:26.310
in his blackmailing scheme
to cover up his tracks?

24:26.397 --> 24:27.773
That's what I'd do.

24:27.857 --> 24:29.565
So if we trace his calls...

24:29.651 --> 24:32.735
We should have a pretty good idea
of who he was blackmailing.

24:36.324 --> 24:41.152
List of calls sorted by phone number
and frequency of calls.

24:41.246 --> 24:44.579
- Who's number one?
- Bartex Corporation.

24:44.833 --> 24:48.083
- What do they do?
- Let's Google them and find out.

24:57.178 --> 24:58.756
There we go.

24:58.847 --> 25:01.551
"Bartex Corporation is
a diversified conglomerate

25:01.641 --> 25:03.828
"deriving revenues from a number
of wide-ranging industries.

25:03.852 --> 25:06.140
"Paper and forest products,
natural gas distribution,

25:06.229 --> 25:08.471
- "aerospace..."
- Get into the facts.

25:08.565 --> 25:12.609
"Bartex was recently awarded
a $200,000,000 design contract

25:12.694 --> 25:16.478
"for the next generation
of carrier fighter jets by the U.S. Navy."

25:17.824 --> 25:21.904
- Things get curiouser and curiouser.
- Seems like we're back to kickbacks.

25:22.787 --> 25:25.159
But Master Chief Nutter
said that Gordon

25:25.248 --> 25:27.184
wasn't high enough
on the food chain for kickbacks.

25:27.208 --> 25:28.584
Maybe he was lying.

25:28.668 --> 25:31.704
Or maybe Nutter was taking kickbacks
from the Bartex Corporation,

25:31.796 --> 25:33.649
and Gordon found out
and started blackmailing him.

25:33.673 --> 25:34.871
That works.

25:34.966 --> 25:36.959
Tony, did you check out
all the Tauruses

25:37.051 --> 25:38.795
that had parking permits at Pax River?

25:39.804 --> 25:41.547
Yeah. All except for Wong's,

25:41.639 --> 25:44.213
which is allegedly somewhere
between here and Phoenix.

25:44.309 --> 25:46.135
APB's haven't turned up anything.

25:46.227 --> 25:48.635
- Did you check Mercury Sables?
- No.

25:50.356 --> 25:51.685
But they're the same car.

25:54.152 --> 25:56.275
I have a list of permits here.

25:56.821 --> 25:59.857
Four Sables have base permits.
And this is interesting.

26:00.617 --> 26:03.108
Master Chief Nutter drives a Sable.

26:03.369 --> 26:05.409
Why is that interesting?

26:05.496 --> 26:08.830
We think that when Gordon found out
that Nutter was taking kickbacks,

26:08.917 --> 26:10.292
he blackmailed him.

26:10.376 --> 26:13.211
It gives him motive, murder weapon,
and accounts for the cash.

26:13.296 --> 26:16.166
Easy enough to find out.
All we have to do is look at his car.

26:16.549 --> 26:17.830
Let's go.

26:27.477 --> 26:29.884
- Is Master Chief around?
- No, sir.

26:30.313 --> 26:33.065
- You know where I can find him?
- He didn't say where he was going.

26:33.149 --> 26:34.835
Well, what do you do
if there's an emergency

26:34.859 --> 26:37.397
- and you need to get a hold of him?
- We call his cell, sir.

26:42.408 --> 26:43.488
Talk to me.

26:43.576 --> 26:44.951
Hey, Abs. Gibbs.

26:45.036 --> 26:46.530
If I give you a cell phone number,

26:46.621 --> 26:48.245
can you trace it and give me a location?

26:48.331 --> 26:51.036
Yeah. As long as it's a newer phone
with a GPS chip,

26:51.125 --> 26:52.952
not one of those ancient old bricks.

26:53.044 --> 26:55.202
- How accurate?
- Within 100 metres.

26:55.338 --> 26:56.916
We gotta jump through
any legal hoops?

26:57.215 --> 26:59.540
Well, it's kind of a grey area.

27:00.426 --> 27:01.541
How grey?

27:01.970 --> 27:03.215
Charcoal.

27:04.681 --> 27:06.139
How long does he have to stay on?

27:06.224 --> 27:07.683
All he has to do is answer.

27:08.601 --> 27:11.472
Okay, here's the number.

27:11.562 --> 27:15.145
Area code 702, 555-0127.

27:16.150 --> 27:18.226
Okay, it's dialling.

27:18.695 --> 27:19.893
Hello?

27:20.613 --> 27:21.811
Hello?

27:22.991 --> 27:24.189
Hello?

27:24.826 --> 27:27.032
Okay, he's at 18900.

27:27.120 --> 27:28.199
Beallsville Road.

27:28.287 --> 27:29.367
Any idea what's there?

27:33.793 --> 27:35.418
The Bartex Corporation.

27:47.306 --> 27:49.548
Agent Gibbs, what are you doing here?

27:49.642 --> 27:51.469
I was gonna ask you the same thing.

27:51.561 --> 27:53.221
Personal business.

27:53.312 --> 27:55.388
Do you care to elaborate?

27:58.693 --> 28:00.187
Look, you can talk to me now,

28:00.278 --> 28:02.038
or we can do this
in front of Admiral Barnes.

28:02.113 --> 28:03.773
It's your choice.

28:04.490 --> 28:07.160
- Bartex is one of our vendors.
- And?

28:07.243 --> 28:09.781
- Can we keep this between us?
- No.

28:12.582 --> 28:14.393
They've offered me
a position with their company,

28:14.417 --> 28:16.041
and I'm seriously considering taking it.

28:16.127 --> 28:19.211
I didn't want to let anyone know
until I made my final decision.

28:20.006 --> 28:22.461
Can you pop the hood of your car?

28:22.717 --> 28:25.753
- Why?
- Because I asked.

28:36.230 --> 28:37.475
No body work.

28:37.565 --> 28:40.526
The windshield is original equipment
according to the manufacturer's specs.

28:41.027 --> 28:42.984
It hasn't been replaced.

28:43.529 --> 28:45.605
No way this car hit Gordon.

29:06.511 --> 29:09.381
Forty-mile zone ended
two miles back, boss.

29:10.223 --> 29:11.551
Limit's 65.

29:13.392 --> 29:15.468
I only mention it
because you usually drive

29:15.561 --> 29:18.099
slightly faster than Dale Earnhardt, Jr.

29:19.440 --> 29:20.899
- Boss?
- What?

29:21.567 --> 29:24.237
- Do you want to stop for a burger?
- No!

29:27.615 --> 29:30.735
I would've bet a month's salary
it was Chief Nutter.

29:30.827 --> 29:33.863
- You would've lost.
- I always lose when I bet.

29:33.955 --> 29:36.872
- Don't tell me. You had the Cubs.
- Red Sox.

29:39.085 --> 29:41.457
She bet on the Sox, boss.

29:42.672 --> 29:44.047
Not again.

29:46.134 --> 29:48.838
We are not going to lose again!

29:56.185 --> 29:57.893
We are going back to that warehouse

29:57.979 --> 30:01.679
and we are staying until we nail
whoever hit Petty Officer Gordon.

30:23.087 --> 30:24.795
They lied about coming in one car.

30:24.964 --> 30:26.957
Wong's Taurus hit Gordon.

30:27.800 --> 30:29.876
They made up the story
about his brother.

30:29.969 --> 30:33.136
- They? Not Wong?
- They were in it together.

30:34.932 --> 30:38.633
Okay, so, they were all
in a conspiracy to do what?

30:38.978 --> 30:41.599
- Kill their buddy for $40,000?
- Maybe.

30:41.856 --> 30:44.311
Or maybe they just wanted payback.

30:45.318 --> 30:47.809
- You lost me, Gibbs.
- Me, too, boss.

30:48.196 --> 30:50.354
Tony, you check out this lot next door?

30:50.448 --> 30:52.654
A hundred-metre perimeter search
didn't reach the lot.

30:52.742 --> 30:54.070
Then we do 200!

30:54.994 --> 30:57.663
- What are we looking for?
- Answers!

31:00.458 --> 31:03.163
- Do you have plans tonight?
- Not really.

31:04.670 --> 31:07.422
Good, because the last time
Gibbs was like this,

31:07.506 --> 31:09.665
I didn't go home for a week.

31:10.051 --> 31:11.509
The sad part:

31:11.928 --> 31:14.715
That would actually be an improvement
over my social life.

31:21.938 --> 31:23.052
Gibbs!

31:23.147 --> 31:24.392
Tony?

31:28.569 --> 31:30.396
Looks like our latex.

31:30.696 --> 31:31.977
Must've gotten snagged

31:32.073 --> 31:34.343
when somebody slipped
through the fence into the parking lot.

31:34.367 --> 31:36.774
Not someone. Petty Officer Gordon.

31:38.454 --> 31:40.530
Okay, flash and bag it.

31:46.212 --> 31:48.964
- Any idea what this stuff is?
- Of course.

31:49.048 --> 31:50.708
- What?
- Evidence.

31:52.301 --> 31:54.377
That's a good one, Kate.

31:57.598 --> 31:59.674
I don't know, boss. This lot is trashed.

31:59.767 --> 32:03.136
It's gotta be fresh, Tony.
Less than 48 hours old.

32:09.986 --> 32:12.607
- What you got, boss?
- Maybe something.

32:21.539 --> 32:23.828
Do you think
that was left by our four musketeers?

32:23.916 --> 32:25.114
Oh, yeah.

32:25.209 --> 32:27.617
Damn it, Gibbs.
If you know what happened, tell us.

32:27.712 --> 32:29.538
Patience, Kate. Patience.

32:29.630 --> 32:32.916
All right, keep looking, everybody.
Watch your step.

32:34.510 --> 32:36.918
- He doesn't know.
- Wanna bet?

32:39.473 --> 32:41.799
- Kate, get a photo.
- Yeah.

32:46.647 --> 32:50.099
I've got some fresh butts over here.
Petty Officer Morgan smoked.

32:50.192 --> 32:51.770
And Petty Officer Carter.

32:52.069 --> 32:53.777
We'll get DNA from this.

32:57.491 --> 33:00.528
Looks like they had
some kind of tripod over here.

33:13.341 --> 33:16.010
Are you about ready to tell us
what you're thinking?

33:18.929 --> 33:20.507
They filmed it.

33:21.724 --> 33:23.183
Filmed what?

33:39.200 --> 33:41.239
Not a pretty sight, is it?

33:41.577 --> 33:43.783
- Did you have to cut him up like that?
- Oh, yes.

33:43.871 --> 33:48.284
An autopsy is required
in a murder investigation.

33:48.501 --> 33:50.742
Sir, can I please be excused?

33:51.087 --> 33:54.041
Oh, that chance ended three days ago,
Petty Officer Carter.

34:08.145 --> 34:10.850
Twenty bucks Carter wets his pants
before Morgan.

34:12.065 --> 34:13.809
Think this'll work?

34:14.819 --> 34:16.147
It'll work.

34:16.821 --> 34:20.272
- You got my videotape ready?
- Abby's cleaning it up right now.

34:20.366 --> 34:22.938
All right. Let's do this.

34:32.710 --> 34:36.045
We never put four people
in the same interrogation room, ever!

34:37.174 --> 34:38.503
Do you wanna know why?

34:38.592 --> 34:40.550
Because we don't want them
comparing stories

34:40.636 --> 34:42.629
or conspiring to hide the truth.

34:42.721 --> 34:46.054
But in your case,
we're willing to make an exception.

34:49.812 --> 34:51.639
I know what happened.

34:51.730 --> 34:53.389
Now it's just a question of time.

34:53.482 --> 34:56.436
As in how much time
you'll spend at Leavenworth

34:56.527 --> 34:58.852
if you don't cooperate with us.

35:01.574 --> 35:03.282
It was all a joke.

35:03.451 --> 35:06.238
- It was just a stupid...
- Shut up, Carter.

35:06.579 --> 35:07.741
I want a lawyer.

35:07.830 --> 35:10.403
You know, if I was you, Wong,
I'd want a lawyer, too.

35:10.499 --> 35:12.326
What if we cooperate, sir?

35:12.585 --> 35:15.870
Morgan, all they have
is a strip of rubber.

35:15.963 --> 35:18.584
If they can charge us,
they would've already.

35:18.674 --> 35:20.049
What about your car, Wong?

35:20.134 --> 35:21.758
Do you know how hard it is

35:21.844 --> 35:24.216
to wash blood stains
off a car these days?

35:25.764 --> 35:29.180
- Are you saying you have my car?
- You saying we don't?

35:29.435 --> 35:32.389
- There's no way you have my car.
- Are you sure about that?

35:32.480 --> 35:34.437
What is this, "bad cop, dumb cop"?

35:34.523 --> 35:35.934
My car is long gone.

35:36.025 --> 35:38.598
- My brother...
- I don't need your car.

35:42.281 --> 35:43.740
I have this.

35:54.793 --> 35:57.960
Never put anything on videotape
that you don't want to be seen.

35:58.047 --> 35:59.920
Just ask Paris Hilton.

36:00.216 --> 36:04.260
You had your chance to come clean.
It would've helped with the sentencing.

36:04.970 --> 36:06.133
Wait.

36:06.805 --> 36:08.383
I'll talk, sir.

36:08.557 --> 36:09.720
It was an accident.

36:09.808 --> 36:11.649
We didn't think
anyone was gonna get hurt, sir.

36:11.727 --> 36:13.387
Whose idea was it?

36:15.648 --> 36:18.981
It was Gordon's, sir.
He was planning it for months.

36:19.109 --> 36:21.814
It was payback for the time
when Wong set him up

36:21.904 --> 36:24.146
on a blind date with a transvestite.

36:24.240 --> 36:26.031
Don't you see
what they're trying to do here?

36:26.116 --> 36:27.148
We have to stick...

36:27.243 --> 36:29.698
Gordon is laying on a slab down there
because of us, Wong.

36:29.787 --> 36:32.622
Yeah, maybe you can live with that.
I can't.

36:32.998 --> 36:35.952
Who was the girl?
Somebody's girlfriend?

36:37.378 --> 36:38.623
Hooker?

36:40.965 --> 36:42.957
She was a call girl, sir.

36:46.679 --> 36:49.300
And you hired her
to lure Wong out of the club

36:49.390 --> 36:51.881
into the parking lot for your joke.

36:59.525 --> 37:00.853
I'm sorry!

37:02.945 --> 37:04.404
Or maybe not.

37:06.198 --> 37:08.321
Do you wanna dance? Come on!

37:23.549 --> 37:26.218
- Is your car in the parking lot?
- Yeah.

37:27.052 --> 37:28.333
Let's go!

37:30.889 --> 37:33.463
Must have been some girl,
Petty Officer Wong.

37:34.893 --> 37:38.097
Who was in charge
of the setup in the vacant lot?

37:38.272 --> 37:39.647
It was me and Gordon, sir.

37:41.567 --> 37:44.734
- This is gonna be legendary!
- Yeah, it is, dude.

37:45.988 --> 37:47.482
Let's do this.

37:48.824 --> 37:51.529
Man, Wong is going to piss his pants!

37:56.957 --> 37:58.749
Let's get it set up.

38:01.253 --> 38:04.373
Hurry up, man.
She's gonna bring him out soon.

38:04.506 --> 38:07.211
- Dude, where's the camera?
- I thought you had it.

38:07.301 --> 38:10.171
You left it in the car, you moron!
Let's go!

38:11.764 --> 38:14.136
Seems like
you guys had it all organised.

38:14.224 --> 38:15.849
What went wrong?

38:16.477 --> 38:18.268
Wong panicked, sir.

38:24.276 --> 38:25.735
You go, girl!

38:26.945 --> 38:28.440
It's showtime.

38:34.620 --> 38:35.865
What's wrong?

38:35.954 --> 38:38.161
- Did you see some lights?
- No.

38:43.003 --> 38:45.411
Cue the dry ice.
Tell Gordon to haul ass.

38:49.968 --> 38:52.376
Wong is gonna have a heart attack!

38:54.473 --> 38:56.798
You don't seem
like the type that scares easily,

38:56.892 --> 38:58.600
Petty Officer Wong.

38:58.769 --> 39:00.263
I didn't know.

39:01.188 --> 39:03.346
I didn't know it was Chris.

39:06.610 --> 39:08.270
What's that sound?

39:13.325 --> 39:16.528
- What the hell is that?
- Oh, my God!

39:17.746 --> 39:20.451
It's coming right at us! Do something!

39:20.541 --> 39:22.617
Where the hell are my keys?

39:24.086 --> 39:25.331
I can't find my keys!

39:35.013 --> 39:36.093
No!

39:40.978 --> 39:43.551
He was our best friend, Agent Gibbs.

39:45.190 --> 39:46.850
And we killed him.

39:47.901 --> 39:51.270
That was a pretty good practical joke.
Too bad your buddy died.

39:51.864 --> 39:54.734
- It was an accident, sir.
- What about the $40,000?

39:54.825 --> 39:56.568
Are you telling me
no one knew about that?

39:56.660 --> 39:59.994
Sir, none of us had any idea
that Gordon had that kind of money.

40:00.080 --> 40:01.641
We never should've
tried to hide the body.

40:01.665 --> 40:03.159
But it was an accident, sir.

40:03.250 --> 40:05.408
Is that true, Petty Officer Wong?

40:05.711 --> 40:07.538
No one knew about it?

40:08.714 --> 40:11.205
The only thing
I am guilty of here is manslaughter.

40:11.300 --> 40:12.924
You saw the tape.

40:13.177 --> 40:16.877
- Is he talking about this tape, Tony?
- I think he is, boss.

40:18.348 --> 40:20.140
This isn't your tape.

40:20.517 --> 40:22.426
But you're in it, Wong.

40:35.449 --> 40:37.904
Twenty-two-year-olds cashing

40:37.993 --> 40:40.449
$40,000 inheritance cheques

40:41.622 --> 40:44.457
is something bank tellers tend to notice.

40:58.764 --> 41:00.591
You noticed it, too.

41:03.811 --> 41:05.091
It was...

41:06.647 --> 41:08.105
It was an accident.

41:08.190 --> 41:09.814
We have a witness.

41:16.156 --> 41:18.196
Did Wong know that it was a prank?

41:19.910 --> 41:21.910
How much was he giving you
to keep your mouth shut?

41:23.038 --> 41:24.449
$1,000.

41:25.249 --> 41:26.743
He knew it was a prank?

41:29.336 --> 41:31.792
He said his friend
was trying to get even with him.

41:31.880 --> 41:33.707
You knew it was Chris.

41:45.519 --> 41:49.730
- Hey, you got any plans tonight?
- I did. Too late now.

41:50.732 --> 41:54.267
Wanna grab some Chinese
at the new place down the street?

41:54.361 --> 41:55.440
Sure.

41:55.779 --> 41:57.902
- Wanna ask Gibbs?
- He's busy.

42:01.493 --> 42:03.865
- Doing what?
- Same thing he does every night.
