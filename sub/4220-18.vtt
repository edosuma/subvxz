WEBVTT

00:01.126 --> 00:03.252
What do you think about
a fun night out tomorrow?

00:03.337 --> 00:05.546
I would much rather
hang out at home

00:05.631 --> 00:07.131
and watch the Blackhawks
game with you.

00:07.257 --> 00:10.051
I adore Cruz. But it's
not the life I want.

00:10.552 --> 00:12.929
Scott Rice is gonna join us
for a shift. Trial run.

00:13.263 --> 00:14.806
I earned that spot
with hard work.

00:16.266 --> 00:18.184
Rice has the job.
He needs it, trust me.

00:18.352 --> 00:19.394
I need it too.

00:19.687 --> 00:21.437
You know
who's working over
at Chicago Med?

00:21.772 --> 00:23.064
Who?
April Sexton.

00:23.357 --> 00:24.649
Wow, Kelly!

00:24.942 --> 00:26.234
Let me take you
out for a drink
sometime.

00:26.360 --> 00:28.027
No, I don't think so.

00:28.112 --> 00:29.070
Why not?

00:29.154 --> 00:30.238
It actually takes
being a good friend

00:30.322 --> 00:31.948
to earn my forgiveness.

00:35.160 --> 00:39.205
Oh, man, I haven't
been here in forever.

00:39.289 --> 00:40.540
Their hash browns
are still the best

00:40.624 --> 00:41.624
hangover cure in Chicago.

00:47.589 --> 00:48.673
Yeah.

00:51.468 --> 00:52.552
What?

00:52.636 --> 00:54.178
Like old times.

00:54.304 --> 00:55.430
Hey, Scott.

00:55.514 --> 00:56.597
Hey.

00:58.225 --> 00:59.267
Oh.

00:59.601 --> 01:01.310
Sit down, sit down.

01:02.771 --> 01:03.855
What?

01:06.567 --> 01:08.985
What? I got the band
back together.

01:10.279 --> 01:11.612
So, breakfast is on me

01:11.989 --> 01:14.949
if you can tell me
the name of the kid

01:15.033 --> 01:17.076
who fought Mitch Drogan
behind the wall
in eighth grade.

01:17.161 --> 01:18.202
I have no idea.

01:18.328 --> 01:19.829
Sure you do.

01:19.913 --> 01:23.207
Japanese
exchange student.

01:23.625 --> 01:24.917
Oh, Shintaro?
Yes!

01:25.002 --> 01:26.252
Shintaro Kitsuda.

01:26.336 --> 01:27.462
Remember,
he kicked off his shoes

01:27.546 --> 01:28.963
and went karate
on Drogan's ass.

01:31.008 --> 01:33.050
See? See, this is good.

01:35.512 --> 01:36.512
How are your folks?

01:36.680 --> 01:38.639
Good. I told them
I ran into you.

01:38.724 --> 01:39.724
Oh, yeah?

01:39.808 --> 01:41.058
They said they'd love
to see you.

01:41.560 --> 01:43.978
They still do
the Saturday night Frito Pie.

01:44.104 --> 01:45.813
That right?
Mmm-hmm.

01:50.360 --> 01:53.905
Um, I should get
a jump on inventory.

01:53.989 --> 01:55.031
You're not gonna eat?

01:55.574 --> 01:57.033
I had a bagel at home.

01:59.661 --> 02:00.745
Wait.

02:01.663 --> 02:02.789
Are you avoiding Cruz?

02:02.873 --> 02:03.873
Shh. Shh.

02:03.957 --> 02:04.957
You guys work together!

02:05.042 --> 02:06.667
You can't run
around the hallways

02:06.752 --> 02:07.919
like a scared rabbit.

02:08.045 --> 02:09.045
Sure I can.

02:09.129 --> 02:10.171
Trust me, if you're
gonna dump him,

02:10.255 --> 02:12.548
it's better to just rip
the Band-Aid clean off
rather than...

02:24.978 --> 02:26.229
What?

02:26.396 --> 02:28.231
Brett loves fruit salad.
Hates cantaloupe.

02:28.732 --> 02:31.859
I'm telling you, boys,
it's the little things,

02:32.277 --> 02:33.319
they make all the difference.

02:33.403 --> 02:36.280
Oh, yeah,
I used to do things like that
for Cindy all the time.

02:36.365 --> 02:37.990
Now my idea of chivalry is,

02:38.075 --> 02:40.409
I... I light a match
when I use the john.

02:41.578 --> 02:42.578
Mills.

02:42.663 --> 02:44.038
Your sister's here.

02:44.122 --> 02:45.206
Hmm?

02:47.751 --> 02:49.210
Hey, she's awake!

02:49.461 --> 02:50.461
How long was I out?

02:50.546 --> 02:54.006
I'm fairly sure you
slept about 15 hours.

02:54.091 --> 02:55.883
Somebody told me the jet lag
is easier coming West,

02:55.968 --> 02:57.218
but I don't know.

02:57.302 --> 02:58.886
Well, I only got two words
out of you yesterday.

02:58.971 --> 03:00.471
So how was it?

03:01.139 --> 03:02.181
Amazing.
Yeah.

03:02.266 --> 03:04.016
Terrifying but amazing.

03:04.101 --> 03:06.269
I saw the pictures you posted
with the tents and shacks

03:06.353 --> 03:07.854
and... And then
they started talking

03:07.938 --> 03:09.564
about Ebola nonstop
on the news.

03:09.648 --> 03:11.649
But there's hope,
at least in Gambia.

03:11.733 --> 03:12.692
Yeah.

03:12.776 --> 03:14.402
Anyway, I'm glad I went
and I'm glad I'm home.

03:14.486 --> 03:15.695
Yeah. So good to see you.

03:15.779 --> 03:16.779
I missed you.

03:18.407 --> 03:20.408
Tell me about this letter
from the estate
of Leonard Mills?

03:20.492 --> 03:22.451
Dad's dad, right?
Yeah. Yeah.

03:22.828 --> 03:23.953
You guys met
while I was gone?

03:24.538 --> 03:25.705
We talked, yeah.

03:25.789 --> 03:26.914
What was he like?

03:26.999 --> 03:30.042
He was tough,
but he came around.

03:30.127 --> 03:32.086
I think it ended
on a good note, really.

03:32.212 --> 03:35.673
Well, we're supposed
to go see someone
about his will.

03:35.799 --> 03:37.508
Some attorney,
they want to meet us today.

03:38.218 --> 03:40.344
I'm on shift.
But, uh, you go.

03:41.471 --> 03:44.765
- Truck 81, Squad 3, Ambo 61.
- Structure fire, 1100.

03:45.225 --> 03:46.475
Gotta go.
Yeah.

03:46.518 --> 03:48.144
I'll check this out
and fill you in.
Thank you.

03:49.146 --> 03:51.480
1100 Hermitage.
Where's that?
Back of the Yards?

03:51.565 --> 03:53.691
Canaryville.
Two blocks from
where I grew up!

04:19.009 --> 04:21.218
Got fire blowing
on two floors.

04:21.303 --> 04:22.803
We only have time
for a primary.

04:23.138 --> 04:24.138
Make it count.

04:27.017 --> 04:27.975
I don't know
what happened.

04:28.060 --> 04:29.852
The wall socket
started sparking and...

04:29.937 --> 04:31.145
Anyone else in there?

04:31.688 --> 04:33.606
My son Alex!
He's still upstairs!

04:35.442 --> 04:37.360
All right, Herrmann,
Dawson, top floor!

04:37.486 --> 04:38.611
Otis, vent the roof!

04:38.695 --> 04:39.695
Mouch, with me!

04:42.407 --> 04:44.909
Quickly, people!
We are working
on borrowed time.

04:50.791 --> 04:52.917
Fire department, call out!

04:56.880 --> 04:58.172
Herrmann!

04:59.091 --> 05:00.383
Herrmann!

05:00.842 --> 05:02.093
You're too far ahead!

05:02.761 --> 05:04.971
All units!
We have a flashover building!

05:05.055 --> 05:06.305
You have one minute!

05:06.682 --> 05:08.224
We gotta go now!

05:11.228 --> 05:12.311
Pull back!

05:12.396 --> 05:13.771
Pull back!

05:21.822 --> 05:24.657
You have 30 seconds!
Pull back now!

05:27.369 --> 05:28.369
Pull back!

05:42.718 --> 05:43.759
Where's Herrmann?

05:46.054 --> 05:47.263
Uh, he was right
on my heel, and then...

05:49.099 --> 05:50.725
Herrmann, report.

05:56.314 --> 05:57.690
Hey, Chief, listen up.

05:57.899 --> 05:59.442
I'm stuck!
I gotta bail out!

05:59.526 --> 06:01.444
I'm by the upper
northwest window!

06:01.862 --> 06:02.903
Copy!

06:04.031 --> 06:06.198
Rice, let's get
a 28-foot ladder
up there, now!

06:06.283 --> 06:07.783
- On it!
- Let's go!

06:20.464 --> 06:22.381
Hurry up
with that ladder!

06:24.426 --> 06:25.426
Okay.

06:30.640 --> 06:32.308
All right, here, buddy.

06:32.642 --> 06:34.060
You got him?

06:34.853 --> 06:35.895
I got him.

06:58.710 --> 07:00.377
I got you, Herrmann.

07:03.173 --> 07:05.007
I'm hearing stridor.

07:06.802 --> 07:08.594
Inhalation burns.
Really bad.

07:08.678 --> 07:09.720
I'll bag him.

07:09.971 --> 07:11.931
Brett, use the IO drill
to get a line.

07:16.812 --> 07:17.812
How is he?

07:17.896 --> 07:18.938
Inhalation burns.

07:19.022 --> 07:20.022
We're taking him
to Chicago Med.

07:20.107 --> 07:21.524
No, no. What's happening?
What are they doing?

07:21.900 --> 07:23.109
He's gonna die!

07:23.193 --> 07:24.360
He's gonna die!

07:24.444 --> 07:26.278
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Hey, easy. Easy, sir.

07:26.363 --> 07:27.363
Easy, easy, easy.

07:27.656 --> 07:29.365
He's in good hands.
They're gonna take him
to the hospital.

07:29.491 --> 07:30.533
No, no, no, no!
Let me go!
Hey!

07:30.659 --> 07:32.409
Let me go!
He's gonna die!
Hey, listen, I know...

07:32.494 --> 07:34.495
I know how you feel,
all right?

07:34.579 --> 07:36.038
But you gotta
let the medics
do their thing.

07:36.665 --> 07:38.791
Listen, your boy's
gonna pull through.

07:38.875 --> 07:42.294
And when he does,
he's gonna need
his dad, okay?

07:42.546 --> 07:43.629
Right?

07:43.713 --> 07:44.797
Okay.

07:45.048 --> 07:47.258
Deep breaths.

07:47.384 --> 07:49.260
Take some deep breaths.
All right?

07:49.469 --> 07:51.345
You gotta stay strong.

08:11.074 --> 08:12.116
What's the word?

08:13.952 --> 08:15.161
I don't know,

08:15.245 --> 08:17.580
it was a tough intubation,
but we got him there alive.

08:18.123 --> 08:19.165
He's on a ventilator.

08:19.249 --> 08:20.583
Damage to his lungs
and trachea,

08:20.667 --> 08:21.750
but the doctors
are optimistic.

08:24.713 --> 08:25.713
Hey, how are
you holding up?

08:25.797 --> 08:27.590
I'm fine, just spent.

08:27.924 --> 08:29.133
You know, I'm gonna
hit the laundry

08:29.217 --> 08:31.385
before we get called again.

08:42.439 --> 08:44.773
Impressive bailout
this morning.

08:44.941 --> 08:46.901
You're lucky no one from
the academy was there.

08:48.653 --> 08:49.737
They'd have you
teaching classes

08:49.821 --> 08:51.238
till the end of time.

08:51.489 --> 08:52.698
It's all muscle memory.

08:52.782 --> 08:55.284
Just proves that my biceps
are smarter than I am.

08:57.537 --> 09:00.831
I'm writing up my report,
a little disconnect here.

09:01.416 --> 09:03.709
When exactly did you
and Dawson get separated?

09:04.336 --> 09:05.502
She said
you were on her heel

09:05.587 --> 09:07.296
when she came out.

09:07.923 --> 09:09.757
Not clear how you ended up
in the nursery.

09:09.966 --> 09:11.717
Eh, sort of
a split second thing.

09:11.801 --> 09:12.801
Heard the kid.

09:12.886 --> 09:14.053
Took another route.

09:15.972 --> 09:18.682
Was that before or after
the Chief ordered
the pull back?

09:28.985 --> 09:30.819
It was one hell
of a save, Herrmann.

09:32.864 --> 09:35.532
Thanks, Lieutenant.

09:36.576 --> 09:37.952
Appreciate it.

09:40.538 --> 09:42.998
Hey. Chief needs to see
you both in his office.

09:47.462 --> 09:48.462
What's going on?

09:48.546 --> 09:50.089
Close the door.
Hey.

09:50.173 --> 09:52.675
Officers Burgess and Roman
wanna ask you a few questions

09:52.759 --> 09:54.760
about the Canaryville fire
this morning.

09:54.844 --> 09:56.345
Your company was first
on the scene, right?

09:56.429 --> 09:57.429
That's correct.

09:57.597 --> 09:59.390
Any first impressions
on how the fire started?

09:59.891 --> 10:02.101
Best we can tell,
it started upstairs
in the bedroom.

10:02.185 --> 10:05.771
The victim on the scene
reported sparks coming
from an electrical socket.

10:05.855 --> 10:07.731
This victim.
He's the guy
living there, right?

10:07.816 --> 10:09.233
Ed Slater?
Father of the kid?

10:10.235 --> 10:12.611
I didn't catch his name,
but, uh, I believe so.

10:12.737 --> 10:14.530
Was he acting unusual
or erratic?

10:14.614 --> 10:16.615
His kid was gettin' an IV
drilled into his leg.

10:16.700 --> 10:18.325
So how else would he be?

10:18.952 --> 10:20.369
What's this about, exactly?

10:20.870 --> 10:22.746
PD received an e-mail
from somebody claiming

10:22.831 --> 10:24.081
to be a former friend
of Slater.

10:24.874 --> 10:26.458
The friend thought
Slater may have somehow

10:26.543 --> 10:28.377
been responsible
for the fire.

10:28.461 --> 10:29.753
In a criminally
negligent way.

10:31.715 --> 10:33.257
And how would
this person know that?

10:34.718 --> 10:35.801
Show 'em.

10:46.229 --> 10:47.563
Aw, man.

10:49.065 --> 10:50.607
I'm so wasted.

10:50.692 --> 10:54.737
Come on, Eddie, man,
let me see you light
another bowl, man.

10:58.742 --> 11:00.075
Come on,
let me see you light up.

11:02.037 --> 11:03.746
Hey, dude, come on.

11:03.997 --> 11:06.081
Let me in
on that, Eddie.

11:07.292 --> 11:09.126
No, man, you can't
do that, man.

11:09.210 --> 11:10.252
Come on.
Oh, my God.

11:10.670 --> 11:12.463
Did he just blow smoke
in the kid's face?

11:13.173 --> 11:14.256
Yeah.

11:17.677 --> 11:19.094
That's not
cigarette smoke, is it?

11:19.721 --> 11:20.929
Meth, or crack.

11:22.057 --> 11:24.475
Those pipes burn hot
and stay hot.

11:25.143 --> 11:26.727
Our guys think it may
have caused the fire.

11:28.104 --> 11:30.731
I spoke to this guy,
father to father.

11:31.775 --> 11:33.108
Where is he?
Gone.

11:33.193 --> 11:34.443
Checked himself
out of the ER.

11:34.527 --> 11:35.986
I mean,
until we got hold
of that video,

11:36.071 --> 11:37.738
nobody had any reason
to suspect.

11:37.822 --> 11:39.865
What, you're saying
this scumbag's
in the wind?

11:39.949 --> 11:40.949
Herrmann...

11:41.034 --> 11:42.576
OFI's coordinating
with our detectives.

11:42.660 --> 11:44.453
We have boots
on the ground.
We'll find him.

11:53.588 --> 11:55.881
And the whole while
he's just laughing,

11:55.965 --> 11:57.758
like it's some kinda
game or something.

11:58.051 --> 12:00.344
Whatever this guy gets,
it is not enough.

12:04.974 --> 12:06.016
Hey.

12:06.393 --> 12:07.434
You okay?

12:09.062 --> 12:10.646
A long way from it,
Lieutenant.

12:13.483 --> 12:16.735
Listen, I know folks
in that neighborhood
from way back.

12:20.073 --> 12:23.659
Folks who'd tell me things
that they'd never tell a cop.

12:27.664 --> 12:28.956
Guys, mount up.

12:29.833 --> 12:31.333
We're gonna take a ride.

12:52.021 --> 12:53.313
On your left.

12:53.398 --> 12:55.566
The porch
with the AstroTurf.

13:00.697 --> 13:01.822
Grab your Halligans.

13:01.906 --> 13:04.199
We walk the perimeter
like we're checking
a gas leak.

13:04.284 --> 13:05.701
Keep your eyes open.

13:16.045 --> 13:17.212
Another fire?

13:17.297 --> 13:19.381
No, sir.
Just some questions.

13:21.134 --> 13:22.801
I don't know
if you remember me,

13:22.886 --> 13:25.137
but I lived around
the corner years ago.

13:25.513 --> 13:26.680
Bill Herrmann's boy?

13:27.682 --> 13:28.640
Christopher!

13:28.725 --> 13:31.602
My holy hell!
Look at you!

13:31.686 --> 13:34.438
A firefighter of all
the damned fool things.

13:34.856 --> 13:36.732
Say, question for you.

13:40.570 --> 13:42.279
You still keep tabs
on the block?

13:42.572 --> 13:44.823
Not like I used to.

13:47.285 --> 13:48.869
What about that family
from the fire?

13:48.953 --> 13:50.078
Not much of a family.

13:50.330 --> 13:52.247
That fella, uh, Ed?

13:52.790 --> 13:53.832
He's a doper.

13:54.083 --> 13:56.335
He got the house
when his aunt died.

13:56.419 --> 13:57.836
Baby's mom is
in Cook County

13:57.921 --> 13:59.338
for possession.

13:59.839 --> 14:02.049
She left the child
with him...

14:02.133 --> 14:03.342
Terrible idea.

14:03.968 --> 14:04.968
Yeah.

14:05.261 --> 14:06.762
Oh, that boy?

14:07.263 --> 14:08.388
That boy, did he...

14:09.766 --> 14:11.099
Critical condition.

14:13.311 --> 14:15.103
I'll never understand
this world.

14:15.730 --> 14:17.105
The father.

14:17.690 --> 14:19.233
Any idea where
he's holed up?

14:19.317 --> 14:21.568
Your guess is
as good as mine.

14:21.861 --> 14:25.822
Oh, but, yeah, at...
At noon, every day,

14:27.450 --> 14:30.452
there's one place
he's guaranteed to show up.

14:36.292 --> 14:37.876
Any luck with
the old man?

14:38.711 --> 14:39.795
Nada.

14:41.464 --> 14:43.715
Truck 81, Squad 3, Ambo 61.

14:56.980 --> 14:59.565
This is so messed up, man.
He was... He was slamming
around the turn,

14:59.649 --> 15:00.899
laying down
a perfect stripe, you know.

15:00.984 --> 15:02.734
And it just got away
from him.

15:02.819 --> 15:04.903
Everybody back away,
give us room to work!

15:04.988 --> 15:07.155
Mouch, Otis,
clear this crowd.

15:07.240 --> 15:08.991
We need, uh, tools,
extinguishers...

15:09.492 --> 15:11.410
We have to get
the car off that pole

15:11.494 --> 15:12.619
before we free
either of them.

15:12.829 --> 15:15.372
Casey, Mills, and Brett,
check out the girl,

15:15.456 --> 15:17.499
see if it's safe
to bring this mess
away from her.

15:17.834 --> 15:18.959
On it.
You heard him.

15:19.043 --> 15:20.085
Yep.

15:20.169 --> 15:21.378
She might have
crush syndrome, okay?

15:21.462 --> 15:22.462
I'm gonna run an IV,

15:22.505 --> 15:24.214
prep an amp
of sodium bicarb.
All right.

15:24.507 --> 15:25.716
Hey, guys?

15:25.800 --> 15:27.551
Let's cut these roof posts
and hook a cable,

15:27.635 --> 15:29.678
but don't move it
till we get her away
from the column, all right?

15:29.762 --> 15:31.013
Got it.

15:34.058 --> 15:36.268
Where's my girl? Jenna?

15:36.352 --> 15:38.770
Hey! Hey!
Quit yanking around,
you moron!

15:38.855 --> 15:39.938
You already did
enough for her.

15:40.023 --> 15:41.273
Herrmann!

15:41.357 --> 15:42.399
Grab the mini cutters.

15:42.900 --> 15:44.776
The girl's leg is trapped.
We need to pry it free.

15:51.451 --> 15:52.618
It's tangled at the base.

15:52.702 --> 15:54.202
We'll need to get
under the car.

15:54.621 --> 15:55.829
I can do it.
No problem.

15:55.997 --> 15:57.164
Okay.

15:59.542 --> 16:00.584
How're we looking?

16:00.668 --> 16:01.835
Pulse is weak, rapid.

16:01.919 --> 16:04.796
Uh, I'm gonna empty the bag,
overload her with fluids.

16:04.881 --> 16:06.006
Okay.

16:08.635 --> 16:09.885
It's okay.
We're gonna get you out.

16:10.928 --> 16:12.471
I got it, Casey!
But you got to go slow.

16:12.555 --> 16:14.097
We got a ruptured
fuel line here.

16:14.182 --> 16:15.140
Copy that.

16:15.224 --> 16:16.767
Anything goes wrong,
you back out quick.

16:18.728 --> 16:20.145
Come on, come on, come on.

16:21.356 --> 16:23.398
Oh, no!
No, no, no, no!

16:35.203 --> 16:36.745
That was close.

16:38.039 --> 16:38.997
All clear?

16:39.082 --> 16:40.332
Yeah, good to go.

16:40.416 --> 16:41.458
All right, Tony, now!

16:47.215 --> 16:48.632
It's okay.

16:51.177 --> 16:52.636
Hold on. You'll be okay.

16:57.475 --> 17:00.060
Keep an eye
on that fuel line.

17:02.647 --> 17:03.730
Yeah, we got you!

17:04.607 --> 17:05.941
You're okay.
All right.

17:06.025 --> 17:07.109
All right.

17:07.402 --> 17:08.902
Slide her up.

17:08.986 --> 17:10.320
All right. Good.

17:19.163 --> 17:20.414
All right.

17:24.085 --> 17:25.794
Okay, heart rate's
stable. No shock.

17:25.878 --> 17:27.003
Okay. Lift her up.

17:27.964 --> 17:30.173
Hey, I'll take over
this part.

17:45.314 --> 17:46.606
Okay,
let's get him out.

17:51.821 --> 17:52.988
Easy, buddy.
We're not done yet.

18:18.473 --> 18:19.514
Hey.

18:19.682 --> 18:20.682
What's your read?

18:22.769 --> 18:24.478
He's got
that look in his eyes.

18:24.562 --> 18:27.314
Parents hurting their kids,
it flips a switch.

18:27.398 --> 18:28.523
Yeah.

18:29.150 --> 18:30.317
Stick near him.

18:30.401 --> 18:31.568
Make sure he knows
he's not alone.

18:32.069 --> 18:33.236
Copy that.

18:43.998 --> 18:45.332
Did you draw night watch?

18:45.416 --> 18:47.542
Oh, no. I'm just,
uh, just couldn't sleep.

18:47.627 --> 18:48.835
There's coffee on
if you want some.

18:48.920 --> 18:51.880
No, I'm singularly focused
on stress eating.

18:53.674 --> 18:55.383
Cruz wants to take me out
to dinner tomorrow night.

18:57.053 --> 18:58.136
Yeah?

18:59.472 --> 19:01.223
I'm going to rip off
the Band-Aid.

19:02.767 --> 19:04.726
Aw, man.
I'm sorry about that.

19:07.772 --> 19:09.898
Trust me, I know.
It sucks.

19:10.233 --> 19:13.443
Am I just punishing myself
for finding a good guy?

19:14.487 --> 19:16.071
I mean, I'm not crazy am I?

19:17.114 --> 19:18.406
What answer are you
looking for here?

19:18.491 --> 19:22.285
He's literally
the nicest man
in Chicago.

19:22.745 --> 19:27.415
Oh, I am... I am a terrible,
horrible, awful person.

19:27.750 --> 19:28.750
No.

19:28.876 --> 19:30.126
No, you're not.

19:30.211 --> 19:31.294
Just...

19:31.587 --> 19:32.796
You're just not in love.

19:34.715 --> 19:37.217
I was, and I couldn't
make it work.

19:38.302 --> 19:39.302
So...

19:41.055 --> 19:43.098
What the hell do I know?

19:48.396 --> 19:50.272
Look at us.

19:52.275 --> 19:53.608
Look at us.

19:57.613 --> 20:00.115
So, uh, I was thinking
around 7:00?

20:00.449 --> 20:01.533
Cool.

20:01.826 --> 20:05.120
And, uh, you deserve
something special
for a change.

20:05.830 --> 20:07.873
Uh, how about
that place on Rush

20:07.957 --> 20:08.957
that you've been
wanting to try?

20:09.041 --> 20:12.335
The one with
the, uh, number sign
instead of a name.

20:12.461 --> 20:13.670
HashTag?
Yeah.

20:14.213 --> 20:16.089
I thought you said
that place was
too pretentious.

20:16.632 --> 20:19.217
Well, I should
probably try it
before I judge it, right?

20:20.511 --> 20:21.636
Okay.

20:21.721 --> 20:24.180
That sounds like a plan.
I'll see you tonight.

20:36.319 --> 20:39.863
Hey, sweetie, uh,
I gotta make a run
to the distributor,

20:39.947 --> 20:43.074
but then I'll be home
straight after that, okay?

20:43.492 --> 20:45.577
Tell the kids
I love them.
Give them a kiss.

20:46.871 --> 20:48.163
You good?

20:49.165 --> 20:51.249
I'm fine. Seriously.

20:51.334 --> 20:54.044
I appreciate you guys
lookin' out for me,

20:54.170 --> 20:57.589
but you gotta
stop treating me
like I'm made of glass.

21:02.011 --> 21:04.262
I'm gonna take Logan
to the Science and Industry
Museum today

21:04.347 --> 21:05.597
if you wanna tag along.

21:05.681 --> 21:07.098
They still got
the submarine.

21:07.183 --> 21:09.184
No, thanks.
I got plans.

21:09.268 --> 21:10.560
What kind of plans?

21:10.645 --> 21:13.188
Plans that don't
involve submarines.

21:16.150 --> 21:18.944
It's like Garden of Eden
in the middle
of a Chicago winter.

21:20.696 --> 21:21.696
It's good to see you.

21:21.781 --> 21:23.990
I'm... I'm glad
that we reconnected.

21:24.075 --> 21:25.367
Sincerely.

21:25.451 --> 21:26.451
Okay.

21:26.535 --> 21:28.036
No, I mean it.

21:31.874 --> 21:32.999
The summer I stayed
at your house

21:33.084 --> 21:36.211
was probably the biggest
turning point in my life.

21:38.214 --> 21:40.173
Things could've gone
a whole lot different for me

21:40.257 --> 21:41.800
if your parents
hadn't taken me in.

21:42.134 --> 21:43.885
That was me, though.

21:44.387 --> 21:47.138
I talked to them
and said I have
this friend,

21:47.223 --> 21:48.390
who's got no place
to live and...

21:48.516 --> 21:50.392
I...
And when we got
back to school,

21:51.394 --> 21:54.312
senior year,
guess who acted like
he didn't know who I was?

21:54.397 --> 21:55.605
Okay. I was embarrassed.

21:55.690 --> 21:56.731
No kidding.

21:56.816 --> 21:58.191
Not of you. Of me.

21:59.735 --> 22:01.611
It was my dad.

22:04.573 --> 22:05.991
What he did.

22:08.244 --> 22:09.244
My mom walked in on that.

22:09.328 --> 22:10.829
Did you know that?
No.

22:10.913 --> 22:12.580
In our house.
In their bed.

22:14.458 --> 22:15.792
It was a teacher, April.

22:15.876 --> 22:18.128
A... A teacher
from our school.

22:19.255 --> 22:22.924
And my mom comes to me,
and... And I'm all but what,
16 years old,

22:23.009 --> 22:24.759
and asks me
how long I'd known.

22:24.844 --> 22:26.886
As if I'd been
helping all along.

22:26.971 --> 22:28.388
That's... That's
not your fault.

22:28.472 --> 22:30.515
Yeah, but it didn't
feel like it.

22:30.599 --> 22:33.226
And when my mom
checked out,

22:34.562 --> 22:38.565
or, uh, checked herself in...

22:41.944 --> 22:43.111
Whatever.

22:43.195 --> 22:45.488
So maybe when school started,

22:45.573 --> 22:49.451
and, you know,
I heard everyone
whispering, you know...

22:51.162 --> 22:52.662
I didn't handle it
that well.

22:53.622 --> 22:55.206
Yeah. You didn't.

22:55.291 --> 22:56.791
Yeah, I know.

22:56.876 --> 22:57.876
And I'm sorry.

22:57.960 --> 23:02.756
It's just, the thing is,
when I look at you,
I see that guy.

23:03.340 --> 23:05.341
The one who shut me out.

23:05.718 --> 23:07.677
Well, this guy is sorry.

23:08.471 --> 23:10.972
And this guy doesn't even
know that guy anymore.

23:13.726 --> 23:15.351
It might take me a while
to believe that.

23:16.896 --> 23:18.104
I understand.

23:25.196 --> 23:27.072
You have got
to see this menu, bro.
Hmm.

23:27.156 --> 23:28.198
Half of it's gibberish.

23:29.992 --> 23:34.954
"In the interest
of protecting our food's
natural color palette,

23:35.039 --> 23:39.125
"we kindly request
that all of our guests
wear only dark colors."

23:40.044 --> 23:41.961
Why in the world are you
doing this to yourself?

23:42.713 --> 23:44.380
Because I'm worried, man.

23:44.465 --> 23:45.590
I hear you, but...

23:47.051 --> 23:48.343
But what?

23:48.969 --> 23:50.845
You think I got no shot?

23:50.930 --> 23:54.307
Only so long meatloaf
can hold on to prime rib,
right?

23:55.017 --> 23:56.226
No, man.

23:57.269 --> 24:00.855
I'm just saying any girl
that makes you feel
like meatloaf

24:01.107 --> 24:02.690
isn't prime rib.

24:04.276 --> 24:06.194
At least not
your prime rib.

24:18.499 --> 24:19.541
Help you with something?

24:21.001 --> 24:22.293
Cup of coffee. Black.

24:22.378 --> 24:24.712
There's a diner
down the street.

24:24.964 --> 24:26.923
I'm not down
the street, am I?

24:36.684 --> 24:38.351
Where do you think
you're going, huh?

24:39.562 --> 24:41.229
You almost burn
your kid alive,

24:43.023 --> 24:45.150
and you expect to just
get away with it? Huh?

24:45.901 --> 24:47.068
Answer me!

24:47.403 --> 24:49.154
Stop! Stop!

24:50.114 --> 24:51.698
It's over! It's over!

24:51.782 --> 24:52.866
Hey! Hey!

24:54.201 --> 24:55.660
Look at him!

25:05.129 --> 25:07.005
Yeah, I need
the 21 st District.

25:07.089 --> 25:09.340
Trying to reach
Officers Burgess and Roman.

25:19.476 --> 25:20.560
I never meant
to hurt him.

25:20.644 --> 25:21.895
Save it.

25:22.688 --> 25:25.106
Looks like he got
a little facial work done.
Almost didn't recognize him.

25:25.941 --> 25:27.525
Bar was a pretty
rough place.

25:27.610 --> 25:29.277
Must've gotten in a fight
before we got there.

25:30.279 --> 25:31.988
Yeah, well, it's a rough
and tumble world.

25:32.072 --> 25:33.656
The report's in
from the CFD.

25:33.741 --> 25:35.783
The fire was caused by
an embering crack pipe.

25:35.868 --> 25:38.411
So we can officially add arson
to the list of charges.

25:38.787 --> 25:40.371
Yeah, thanks again
for the heads up.

25:40.456 --> 25:41.539
Yeah.

25:42.875 --> 25:44.626
So, that's it then?

25:45.252 --> 25:46.252
Why?

25:46.795 --> 25:49.047
Something else
you need to tell us?

25:49.840 --> 25:51.799
No. We're good.
Thanks again, guys.

25:53.594 --> 25:54.969
Come on. Let's go.

25:58.224 --> 26:00.058
I only wanted to
rattle his cage a bit.

26:00.142 --> 26:01.601
It's rattled.

26:05.314 --> 26:07.023
You tell Chief yet?

26:07.274 --> 26:08.233
No.

26:08.317 --> 26:09.567
You can do that
if you want.

26:09.652 --> 26:10.735
Or not.

26:10.819 --> 26:12.487
You were off duty
and as far as
I'm concerned

26:12.571 --> 26:14.781
you went home
and hung out
with your family.

26:30.547 --> 26:32.090
Listen, uh, Joe.

26:32.174 --> 26:34.259
Before we get
too deep into dinner...

26:34.343 --> 26:35.760
How do you
order the steak?

26:35.844 --> 26:37.428
It's only listing desserts.

26:37.513 --> 26:39.973
Um, you gotta...
You gotta press
on the plate.

26:40.432 --> 26:41.516
What?

26:41.600 --> 26:44.185
The...
Okay.

27:01.996 --> 27:04.038
Hey. How's about a toast?

27:05.207 --> 27:06.291
Okay.

27:08.043 --> 27:10.545
Um, here's to...

27:12.089 --> 27:13.548
Leaping into the unknown.

27:28.105 --> 27:29.314
Joe, I just need to say...

27:29.398 --> 27:32.734
Uh, you know,
before you say anything,
let me talk.

27:35.029 --> 27:36.112
Okay.

27:39.116 --> 27:42.327
Um, I like you, Sylvie.

27:43.203 --> 27:45.705
And our time together
has been wonderful.

27:46.915 --> 27:49.208
Uh...

27:52.171 --> 27:55.214
But...

27:57.426 --> 27:58.468
He dumped me.

27:59.094 --> 28:00.470
You mean you dumped him.

28:00.554 --> 28:02.680
No. I mean
he was the dumper.

28:03.390 --> 28:05.016
I was the dumpee.

28:05.184 --> 28:06.934
Uh... Okay.

28:07.936 --> 28:09.645
Yeah. Yeah, you said it.

28:09.730 --> 28:11.981
Well, this is
a good thing, right?

28:12.066 --> 28:13.107
I mean, this is
what you wanted?

28:14.193 --> 28:15.234
Uh...

28:15.736 --> 28:16.736
Brett...

28:16.820 --> 28:18.071
Uh, yeah.
I mean, of course.

28:18.155 --> 28:21.157
I just... I'd been
building it up to...

28:21.617 --> 28:23.368
I mean, he said
he wanted me
to be happy

28:23.452 --> 28:25.370
and that we both shouldn't
have to try so hard

28:25.454 --> 28:29.707
and then he said
something about meatloaf
and prime rib, and...

28:30.709 --> 28:31.959
Where's the wine?

28:32.628 --> 28:34.337
Yeah. Coming right up, girl.

28:40.094 --> 28:42.804
A restaurant?
In North Carolina?

28:42.888 --> 28:43.888
It's ours.

28:45.182 --> 28:46.182
What'd you say to him?

28:46.266 --> 28:47.475
Nothing. I...

28:48.560 --> 28:51.771
I guess he was looking
for forgiveness,
I gave it to him.

28:51.939 --> 28:53.689
Well, it worked.

28:53.774 --> 28:55.316
He left us this restaurant
in his will.

28:55.401 --> 28:56.818
Wow.
I know!

28:57.319 --> 29:00.655
So how much
do you think
we can get for it?

29:00.739 --> 29:01.864
Or...

29:04.326 --> 29:06.869
Or what if we take
a crack at opening it?

29:10.833 --> 29:11.916
You're serious?

29:12.126 --> 29:13.251
Mom lost the Cortland
Street Grill

29:13.335 --> 29:15.545
and now we're being
handed a second chance.

29:17.673 --> 29:18.881
It's fate, Peter.

29:19.299 --> 29:21.259
I... I have my fate.
It's here.

29:21.343 --> 29:23.094
I'm finally about to
get back on Squad.

29:24.096 --> 29:25.930
What has this job
given you, Peter?

29:28.684 --> 29:30.685
It took Dad.
It took everything you had,

29:30.769 --> 29:31.894
it messed with
your health...

29:33.188 --> 29:35.606
And you keep
going back for more.

29:36.024 --> 29:37.066
That's not fair.

29:37.151 --> 29:38.776
At the grill,
we had something
that was ours.

29:38.861 --> 29:40.319
We were together.

29:40.404 --> 29:42.280
And we had fun, right?

29:42.990 --> 29:44.198
We can do this.

29:44.741 --> 29:47.618
You and me and Mom.
You know we can do this.

29:50.581 --> 29:52.582
It'd mean so much to her.

30:00.924 --> 30:02.341
Okay, that is all
for now.

30:02.426 --> 30:04.510
You all stay safe
out there today.

30:04.595 --> 30:06.471
You all are dismissed.

30:12.978 --> 30:14.020
You okay, buddy?

30:14.104 --> 30:16.063
You know,
better than expected.

30:17.065 --> 30:18.107
Brett and I are
gonna be friends.

30:18.192 --> 30:20.818
And, uh, you know,
there was so much pressure.

30:21.111 --> 30:22.320
Totally.

30:22.404 --> 30:24.655
I'm gonna rest up
for a while.

30:24.740 --> 30:25.740
Of course.

30:27.034 --> 30:28.201
What happened
to your hand?

30:30.746 --> 30:32.747
Lee Henry dropped
a tire iron on it.

30:33.207 --> 30:35.249
Yeah. Why would
Lee Henry have
a tire iron?

30:36.585 --> 30:38.669
Those days
are coming, Dad.

30:38.962 --> 30:40.213
Huh.

30:41.465 --> 30:43.216
Anyone hear news
on the boy?

30:43.675 --> 30:45.676
The bleed has resolved,
but they had to
put a shunt in

30:45.761 --> 30:47.094
to reduce
brain swelling.

30:48.305 --> 30:49.347
Sounds bad.

30:49.765 --> 30:51.474
She said it was
a routine procedure.

30:56.188 --> 30:57.563
Uh, hey, Otis?

30:57.648 --> 30:58.814
Oh, hi.

30:58.899 --> 31:01.275
I don't know if Joe
said what happened?

31:01.485 --> 31:02.944
Yeah. Yeah, he did.

31:03.028 --> 31:04.987
Sorry.
Oh, no.
It's... It's okay.

31:05.364 --> 31:06.364
It's for the best
and everything

31:06.448 --> 31:09.492
just, um, he left
a couple of things
at my place.

31:09.618 --> 31:12.703
And this, I'm pretty sure
he borrowed from you.
Ah!

31:13.163 --> 31:14.539
It's got
your name inside.

31:14.623 --> 31:16.165
Totally. I'd...

31:16.250 --> 31:18.251
Thank you, I'd forgotten
I lent this, so...

31:18.377 --> 31:20.044
It's kind of embarrassing
to admit,

31:20.128 --> 31:22.630
but I was completely obsessed
with those books
in high school.

31:22.714 --> 31:24.048
Really?
Oh.

31:24.132 --> 31:27.009
Children of Dune,
way better than
Heretics of Dune.

31:27.344 --> 31:28.553
I mean, honestly,
for my money,

31:28.637 --> 31:29.804
Children is the best
in the series...
I...

31:29.888 --> 31:31.514
Barring the original,
of course.

31:31.598 --> 31:32.682
Yeah.

31:32.808 --> 31:34.892
Children is...
Anyway, um...

31:35.227 --> 31:36.352
I'm glad I could
get it back to you.

31:36.436 --> 31:38.020
And I gotta run.

31:50.075 --> 31:51.284
- What's up?
- Question.

31:52.035 --> 31:54.704
Well, piece of advice
really.

31:55.122 --> 31:56.122
Shoot.

31:56.206 --> 31:58.708
Um, here's the thing...

32:00.669 --> 32:02.336
I think I'm in love
with Brett.

32:03.046 --> 32:05.673
Now, I know what
you're thinking,
but get this.

32:05.757 --> 32:08.259
They broke up last night,
and believe it or not,

32:08.343 --> 32:10.052
Cruz is actually
doing great about it!

32:10.137 --> 32:13.514
So I think,
if a time were to
ever exist, for me...

32:13.599 --> 32:14.682
Otis?

32:14.891 --> 32:16.350
I'm going to
count to three.

32:16.435 --> 32:19.103
On that count of three,
you are going to break out

32:19.187 --> 32:21.606
of whatever state
of denial you're in

32:21.690 --> 32:24.775
that leads you to believe
that even looking at
your best friend's ex

32:24.860 --> 32:27.653
the day after they broke up
is a good idea.

32:27.738 --> 32:29.322
I don't...
Ready?

32:29.448 --> 32:31.073
On three. One, two...

32:31.158 --> 32:34.660
Actually, you know what?
You got to two

32:34.745 --> 32:37.204
and... And I was there
with you.

32:39.041 --> 32:40.207
Thank you.

32:40.292 --> 32:42.043
I don't know what that...

32:57.184 --> 32:58.225
What's going on?

32:58.644 --> 32:59.644
Herrmann.

32:59.728 --> 33:02.229
We just got a call
from Chicago Med.

33:03.106 --> 33:05.066
It's little Alex Slater.

33:05.484 --> 33:08.235
He developed a blood clot
half hour ago.

33:09.404 --> 33:11.238
Doctors are performing
emergency surgery.

33:11.740 --> 33:14.575
The others just wanted
to head over there.

33:16.203 --> 33:17.244
I... Chief, can I...

33:17.329 --> 33:19.622
Yeah. You can
ride along with me.

33:19.706 --> 33:20.706
Okay?
Yeah.

33:20.791 --> 33:22.083
Let's go.

33:27.464 --> 33:29.465
Hey, sorry
to bother you.

33:30.300 --> 33:33.344
No, of course.
Listen, are you
nearby Chicago Med?

33:35.347 --> 33:37.765
Yeah, I got someone
who needs you.

33:45.732 --> 33:46.941
Afternoon, Christopher.

33:47.025 --> 33:48.067
Chaplain.

33:50.112 --> 33:51.487
Any word on the boy?

33:51.780 --> 33:53.781
Uh, he's still
in surgery.

33:53.865 --> 33:56.951
Uh, no one seems to know
anything beyond that.

33:58.412 --> 33:59.745
They tell you
what happened?

33:59.830 --> 34:01.497
What I did yesterday?

34:01.581 --> 34:02.790
I heard.

34:03.709 --> 34:05.960
I'm not here
to pass judgment.

34:06.461 --> 34:08.462
But, uh...

34:08.547 --> 34:13.050
If it's okay,
I'd love it if you could
help me understand.

34:13.719 --> 34:17.972
Because the Christopher
Herrmann I know
is not a violent person.

34:18.682 --> 34:21.142
I wasn't
the Christopher you know.

34:21.643 --> 34:23.144
Not yesterday.

34:24.646 --> 34:26.647
That's not an explanation.

34:35.240 --> 34:36.782
You know, Chap,

34:37.993 --> 34:40.786
the one thing that I always
loved about this job?

34:42.748 --> 34:46.667
Win or lose,
when you rush into
a thousand degree house fire

34:46.752 --> 34:48.544
to save a little boy,

34:49.755 --> 34:51.172
you know you're doing
the right thing.

34:52.215 --> 34:53.674
Something to be proud of.

34:55.051 --> 34:56.510
But this kid,

34:58.388 --> 35:02.767
I pulled him out,
just so he can
go through hell.

35:03.518 --> 35:05.352
And maybe
not make it at all.

35:09.107 --> 35:11.817
It shakes me,
and I think,

35:13.862 --> 35:14.987
would it have
been better...

35:16.782 --> 35:18.824
That's not for us to know.

35:19.534 --> 35:21.202
I hear ya. I do.

35:21.703 --> 35:23.704
But that doesn't change
how it feels.

35:24.915 --> 35:28.501
The thing is, this wasn't
some random chance thing.

35:30.712 --> 35:32.171
This father put him there.

35:34.382 --> 35:37.760
It kept just turning
over and over in my head.

35:38.386 --> 35:39.887
Couldn't stop.

35:42.224 --> 35:43.724
Felt like I had
to do something.

35:45.811 --> 35:47.978
Running into
a burning building

35:48.063 --> 35:49.605
takes bravery,

35:49.731 --> 35:52.149
but it also takes bravery

35:52.234 --> 35:54.401
to give the rest up to God.

35:59.449 --> 36:01.450
I'm workin' on it, Padre.

36:01.743 --> 36:03.244
I'm not there...

36:03.787 --> 36:05.663
But I'm working on it.

36:30.730 --> 36:31.772
Hey.

36:32.566 --> 36:33.566
I had a few moments.

36:33.650 --> 36:34.859
Thought I'd sit
with you folks
for a while.

36:35.360 --> 36:36.944
Yeah, of course.

36:40.115 --> 36:41.198
Yeah.

36:43.618 --> 36:44.785
Really?

36:46.121 --> 36:47.288
You're sure?

36:48.290 --> 36:51.584
No, no, I'm not,
I'm not surprised,
exactly, just...

36:52.586 --> 36:55.588
Thank you.
Thank you so much.

37:09.728 --> 37:12.187
We reduced the size
of the clot considerably.

37:13.148 --> 37:16.025
But unfortunately,
it was too little too late.

37:16.902 --> 37:18.569
The damage
was too severe.

37:19.112 --> 37:21.280
The child slipped away
during surgery.

37:27.162 --> 37:28.495
I'm sorry.

37:45.722 --> 37:49.433
Nearer

37:49.517 --> 37:54.521
My God to Thee

37:55.565 --> 38:00.486
Nearer

38:00.570 --> 38:03.864
To Thee

38:19.172 --> 38:21.173
I want to talk
with you today

38:21.257 --> 38:24.593
about a subject
that touches
every one of us.

38:26.346 --> 38:27.388
Loss.

38:28.139 --> 38:32.101
Sometimes we are faced
with things we think
we just can't handle.

38:32.352 --> 38:34.561
I heard back
from Dr. Gochmann.

38:35.522 --> 38:36.563
And?

38:37.107 --> 38:38.607
I'm cleared for Squad.

38:45.573 --> 38:47.324
I'm so proud of you.

38:49.786 --> 38:50.911
The death of a loved one.

38:52.080 --> 38:53.330
A father.

38:53.915 --> 38:55.165
A child.

38:57.544 --> 39:01.088
And we strive to find
the reason behind it all.

39:01.965 --> 39:05.509
Who needs a baby hug?

39:12.100 --> 39:13.142
Hey, little man.

39:13.268 --> 39:16.270
And when those
reasons don't make sense...
It's me.

39:17.147 --> 39:18.689
We question God.

39:18.773 --> 39:22.484
We look up and we say,
"God, how could you
do this to us?"

39:23.403 --> 39:24.486
Thank you, Mama.

39:24.571 --> 39:27.114
"How can you put
so much on our plate?"

39:28.658 --> 39:31.869
But we're not operating
on God's timetable, are we?

39:31.953 --> 39:34.288
We don't understand
God's plan.

39:34.456 --> 39:35.789
How can we?

39:36.583 --> 39:40.044
And let me tell you,
this is where faith comes in.

39:47.177 --> 39:48.635
Ah.

39:49.554 --> 39:51.472
I heard you guys
still make Frito Pie.

39:52.307 --> 39:53.849
They sure do.

39:57.479 --> 40:01.148
Faith can
help us see his message
in our own lives.

40:02.859 --> 40:04.902
Perhaps this loss is there

40:04.986 --> 40:08.280
to teach us not
to take the ones
we love for granted.

40:09.240 --> 40:12.826
To cherish the simple
mundane moments.

40:13.703 --> 40:17.331
To love others
as fiercely
and as bravely

40:18.416 --> 40:20.834
and as compassionately
as we can.

40:22.837 --> 40:26.256
And in that love,
human love,

40:27.634 --> 40:31.929
forgiving, relentless,
unconditional love,

40:34.599 --> 40:36.225
you'll find peace.

40:37.477 --> 40:38.936
Amen.
