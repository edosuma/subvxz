00:01.500 --> 00:03.125
Announcer: PREVIOUSLY ON
DAWSON'S CREEK...

00:03.125 --> 00:04.792
PACEY WITTER IS A STUDENT OF
YOURS?

00:04.792 --> 00:05.917
YES HE IS.

00:05.917 --> 00:07.708
THERE HAVE BEEN ALLEGATIONS OF A
SEXUAL RELATIONSHIP

00:07.708 --> 00:09.333
BETWEEN YOURSELF AND MR. WITTER.

00:09.333 --> 00:10.834
IS A FAREWELL PERMITTED?

00:12.667 --> 00:13.500
OK.

00:13.500 --> 00:15.333
GO AHEAD, I'LL LOCK UP.

00:15.333 --> 00:17.834
HUH, DO YOU THINK YOU CAN HANDLE
IT?

00:19.000 --> 00:20.834
WHAT THE HELL, THANKS JACK.

00:20.834 --> 00:22.750
IF YOU CAN'T HANDLE BEING IN THE
SAME ROOM WITH ME...

00:22.750 --> 00:24.291
I CAN HANDLE BEING IN THE SAME
ROOM WITH YOU JEN

00:24.291 --> 00:27.417
I JUST CAN'T HANDLE YOU THROWING
YOURSELF AT ME. DONT YOU FIND IT
HUMILIATING?

00:42.708 --> 00:43.542
DAWSON.

00:43.542 --> 00:45.041
WHAT?

00:45.041 --> 00:47.375
WHAT ARE WE DOING?

00:47.375 --> 00:49.291
WHAT DOES IT LOOK
LIKE WE'RE DOING?

00:49.291 --> 00:50.750
IT'S JUST NOT WORKING.

00:50.750 --> 00:53.375
I MEAN, I'M FREEZING,
AND THERE'S BUGS.

00:53.375 --> 00:55.083
CAN'T WE GO
SOMEWHERE ELSE?

00:55.083 --> 00:57.583
WHERE? WE CAN'T GO
TO MY HOUSE, AND WE
CAN'T GO TO YOUR HOUSE.

00:57.583 --> 00:59.333
SO OUR OPTIONS
ARE KIND OF LIMITED.

00:59.333 --> 01:01.375
I KNOW, BUT
I JUST FEEL TOO
SWISS FAMILY ROBINSON.

01:01.375 --> 01:03.375
I MEAN, I'M A
TWENTIETH CENTURY GIRL.

01:03.375 --> 01:05.708
IN ORDER TO MAKE OUT,
I NEED SOME MUSIC,

01:05.708 --> 01:07.708
SOME MOOD LIGHTING, AND
SOME CLIMATE CONTROL.

01:07.708 --> 01:09.000
WHERE'S YOUR
SENSE OF ROMANCE?

01:09.000 --> 01:10.375
WE'VE GOT...

01:10.375 --> 01:12.625
GORGEOUS MOONLIGHT...
SHIMMERING ON THE WATER.

01:12.625 --> 01:14.542
WE'VE GOT STARS OVERHEAD,

01:14.542 --> 01:16.542
CRICKETS CHIRPING.

01:16.542 --> 01:19.083
WE'VE GOT...
WIND IN THE TREES.

01:19.083 --> 01:21.500
IF YOU GET COLD, YOU'VE
GOT ME TO KEEP YOU WARM.

01:21.500 --> 01:23.333
DAWSON.

01:23.333 --> 01:24.708
WHAT?

01:24.708 --> 01:27.708
YOU ARE SO CHEESY.

01:27.708 --> 01:29.166
YOU DON'T LIKE IT?

01:29.166 --> 01:30.583
ARE YOU KIDDING?

01:30.583 --> 01:32.959
I FIND IT
UNBEARABLY SEXY.

02:32.333 --> 02:34.125
Dawson: I WAS ACTUALLY
BEGINNING TO THINK

02:34.125 --> 02:37.000
THIS WHOLE RESTAURANT
IDEA OF YOURS WAS
JUST A PIPE DREAM.

02:37.000 --> 02:39.333
Mitch: NOT IF
I CAN FIND THE
PROPER LOCATION.

02:39.333 --> 02:41.625
THIS WOMAN SWEARS
I'M NOT GOING TO FIND

02:41.625 --> 02:43.458
A BETTER DEAL
THAN HER WAREHOUSE.

02:43.458 --> 02:45.291
WHERE ARE YOU MEETING HER?
RIGHT HERE.

02:45.291 --> 02:47.708
SHE SAID SHE'D
MEET ME AT 8:00.

02:47.708 --> 02:49.959
DAWSON.

02:49.959 --> 02:51.667
MS. JACOBS.

02:51.667 --> 02:53.667
WELL, I'M NOT
YOUR TEACHER
ANYMORE, DAWSON.

02:53.667 --> 02:54.834
YOU CAN CALL
ME TAMARA.

02:54.834 --> 02:57.000
TAMARA JACOBS,
I'M MITCH LEERY.

02:57.000 --> 02:58.166
WE SPOKE ON THE PHONE.

02:58.166 --> 03:00.125
YES. MITCH. HELLO.

03:00.125 --> 03:01.625
ARE YOU MOVING BACK
INTO TOWN?

03:01.625 --> 03:03.208
NO, I'M JUST
IN CAPESIDE FOR
A FEW DAYS,

03:03.208 --> 03:04.625
TO SELL
THIS PROPERTY.

03:04.625 --> 03:06.875
OH.

03:06.875 --> 03:10.333
WELL, I--I SHOULD
GET TO SCHOOL, SO, UH...

03:10.333 --> 03:13.250
BYE, MS.--T-TAMARA.

03:17.333 --> 03:19.500
PACEY, HEY. I NEED
TO TALK TO YOU.

03:19.500 --> 03:21.959
LET ME GUESS.
YOU AND JOEY ARE HAVING
ANOTHER LOVERS' SPAT,

03:21.959 --> 03:23.458
YOU WANT MY OPINION.
HERE IT IS--

03:23.458 --> 03:25.333
JOEY IS BEING SARCASTIC
AND OVERSENSITIVE,

03:25.333 --> 03:27.083
YOU ARE BEING SELF-ABSORBED
AND SUFFOCATING.

03:27.083 --> 03:28.458
PROBLEM SOLVED.

03:28.458 --> 03:29.917
IT HAS NOTHING TO DO
WITH JOEY AND ME.

03:29.917 --> 03:31.208
THIS HAS TO DO WITH YOU.

03:31.208 --> 03:32.542
WHAT, DO I OWE YOU
MONEY AGAIN?

03:32.542 --> 03:34.166
NO. MY DAD
AND I WERE
WALKING DOWNTOWN

03:34.166 --> 03:35.041
AND WE RAN
INTO SOMEBODY.

03:35.041 --> 03:36.792
WHO? HEY, LOOK WHO
THE CAT DRAGGED IN.

03:36.792 --> 03:38.542
HMM, NICE TO SEE
YOU, TOO, PACEY.

03:38.542 --> 03:41.041
DON'T WORRY. I'M JUST HERE
TO GET A FEW BOOKS OUT
OF MY LOCKER,

03:41.041 --> 03:42.208
AND I'LL BE ON MY MERRY WAY.

03:42.208 --> 03:44.500
SO TELL ME, DAWSON,
WHO WAS IT?

03:44.500 --> 03:46.208
WE SHOULD REALLY
TALK ABOUT THIS
IN PRIVATE.

03:46.208 --> 03:47.708
OH, GOD. I GOTTA GO.

03:47.708 --> 03:49.500
IF I'M LATE FOR
MR. MADDOCK'S CLASS AGAIN,

03:49.500 --> 03:50.542
HE'LL HAVE
AN ANEURYSM.

03:50.542 --> 03:51.875
I'LL CATCH YOU
AFTER SCHOOL.

03:51.875 --> 03:53.583
I GOTTA MEET JOEY
FOR THIS ART THING.

03:53.583 --> 03:55.500
AH, THE SACRIFICE
WE MAKE FOR YOUNG LOVE.

03:55.500 --> 03:57.000
LISTEN, MAN,
JUST TALK TO ME LATER.

03:57.000 --> 03:59.166
YEAH...

04:00.750 --> 04:02.708
HEY, JACK.

04:02.708 --> 04:03.708
HI, JOEY.

04:03.708 --> 04:06.208
BAD NEWS.
SITTER CALLED AND
CANCELED ON BESSIE,

04:06.208 --> 04:07.417
SO WE CAN'T OPEN
THIS AFTERNOON.

04:07.417 --> 04:09.333
BUT THE GOOD NEWS IS
YOU HAVE THE DAY OFF.

04:09.333 --> 04:11.417
OK, OR WE COULD
OPEN ANYWAY?

04:11.417 --> 04:13.750
WELL, I'D LOVE TO,
BUT, UH...

04:13.750 --> 04:15.208
BESSIE'S AT HOME
WITH THE BABY,

04:15.208 --> 04:17.041
I HAVE TO GO
TO AN ART LECTURE
AFTER SCHOOL,

04:17.041 --> 04:19.083
SO THERE'S NOBODY THERE TO
COVER ALL THE TABLES.

04:19.083 --> 04:20.583
WELL, THERE'S ME.
I CAN DO IT.

04:20.583 --> 04:23.417
YOU?
INSPECTOR CLOUSSEAU?

04:23.417 --> 04:25.834
WHAT? YOU DON'T THINK
I CAN HANDLE IT?

04:25.834 --> 04:27.750
JACK, EVER SINCE
WE HIRED YOU,

04:27.750 --> 04:29.542
IT'S BEEN NOTHING
BUT A SLAPSTICK COMEDY.

04:29.542 --> 04:32.458
I MEAN, YOU DROP DISHES,
YOU MISPLACE ORDERS,

04:32.458 --> 04:34.250
YOU FALL ALL OVER
YOURSELF.

04:34.250 --> 04:39.375
WHY DON'T YOU JUST
TERMINATE ME IF I'M SUCH
AN INCOMPETENT MORON?

04:39.375 --> 04:42.083
WE DON'T WANT
TO TERMINATE YOU, JACK,

04:42.083 --> 04:45.291
IT'S JUST...

04:45.291 --> 04:48.208
ALL RIGHT.
YOU CAN OPEN.

04:48.208 --> 04:51.625
BESSIE WILL BE RELIEVED,
AND IT'LL BE LIKE
A TEST RUN.

04:51.625 --> 04:53.917
JUST, UH...

04:53.917 --> 04:58.125
DON'T SET THE KITCHEN
ON FIRE OR ANYTHING, OK?

04:58.125 --> 05:03.208
YEAH, WELL, UH, THANKS
FOR THAT UNQUALIFIED
VOTE OF CONFIDENCE.

05:10.208 --> 05:11.708
OH...

05:11.708 --> 05:13.458
NO, ABBY, WOULD YOU GET
THAT OUT OF MY FACE?

05:13.458 --> 05:15.458
OH, COME ON!
IT'S ALLOWANCE TIME,

05:15.458 --> 05:18.083
AND I FEEL A MAJOR
BUYING BINGE COMING ON.

05:18.083 --> 05:19.792
SO, TOMORROW,
GET YOUR POCKETBOOK

05:19.792 --> 05:21.333
AND A PAIR OF
SENSIBLE SHOES,

05:21.333 --> 05:23.291
AND LET'S GO BLOW
SOME SERIOUS DOUGH.

05:23.291 --> 05:25.583
YOU KNOW, I REALLY
DON'T FEEL LIKE SHOPPING.

05:25.583 --> 05:26.792
DON'T FEEL
LIKE SHOPPING?

05:26.792 --> 05:28.583
NO.

05:28.583 --> 05:31.625
YOU DON'T FEEL
LIKE SHOPPING, AND YOU
CALL YOURSELF A WOMAN?

05:31.625 --> 05:34.542
I'M JUST NOT FEELING
ALL THAT FESTIVE, ALL RIGHT?

05:34.542 --> 05:37.208
MY PLAN IS TO SPEND
THE WEEKEND IN BED,

05:37.208 --> 05:39.542
COUNTING
MY CEILING TILES.

05:39.542 --> 05:42.166
OH, PLEASE DON'T TELL ME
THIS HAS SOMETHING TO DO

05:42.166 --> 05:45.667
WITH YOUR LUDICROUS
DAWSON LEERY FIXATION.

05:45.667 --> 05:48.375
JEN, DAMMIT!
YOU'RE SUCH AN ASS!

05:48.375 --> 05:49.500
SHH.

05:49.500 --> 05:51.333
WHAT IS SO GREAT
ABOUT DAWSON LEERY?

05:51.333 --> 05:54.500
HE'S JUST A GUY WITH
A MOTOR MOUTH AND
A LIMP BILLY CLUB.

05:54.500 --> 05:56.625
TURN OVER A ROCK
AND FIND YOURSELF
ANOTHER GUY.

05:56.625 --> 05:58.333
THE WHOLE WORLD'S
CRAWLING WITH THEM.

05:58.333 --> 06:00.333
LOOK, IT'S NOT
THAT EASY, OK?

06:00.333 --> 06:02.750
I MEAN, I GOT REJECTED.
IT HURTS.

06:02.750 --> 06:04.708
AND TO MAKE MATTERS WORSE,

06:04.708 --> 06:08.208
THAT WHOLE
DAWSON-JOEY-PACEY TROIKA,

06:08.208 --> 06:10.166
I JUST HATE BEING
ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF IT,

06:10.166 --> 06:11.792
YOU KNOW, I MEAN,
I USED TO...

06:11.792 --> 06:13.166
FIT IN.

06:13.166 --> 06:16.000
COUNT YOUR BLESSINGS.
THOSE PEOPLE ARE BORING.

06:16.000 --> 06:18.834
YEAH. YEAH, WELL...

06:18.834 --> 06:21.708
I GUESS I JUST
NEED A FEW DAYS

06:21.708 --> 06:23.583
TO NURSE MY
NARCISSISTIC WOUNDS.

06:23.583 --> 06:25.166
JEN?

06:25.166 --> 06:27.041
YOU'VE HAD A FEW DAYS.

06:27.041 --> 06:28.750
YOU'RE PRACTICALLY
IN HIBERNATION.

06:28.750 --> 06:31.166
WINTER IS OVER, JEN.
COME OUT OF YOUR CAVE.

06:31.166 --> 06:33.166
AND I NEED YOU
THIS WEEKEND.

06:33.166 --> 06:35.041
WHAT COULD YOU POSSIBLY
NEED ME FOR?

06:35.041 --> 06:37.708
ALL I'M GONNA DO IS
RAIN ON YOUR PARADE.

06:37.708 --> 06:39.500
WELL...

06:39.500 --> 06:42.041
SHOPPING FOR ME IS
LIKE DEEP SEA DIVING.

06:42.041 --> 06:44.166
IT'S DANGEROUS,
AND IT'S EXCITING,

06:44.166 --> 06:46.667
AND IF I DO IT ALONE,
I MAY NEVER COME UP
FOR AIR.

06:46.667 --> 06:49.834
PLEASE DON'T LET ME
GO BY MYSELF.

06:49.834 --> 06:53.250
I COULD DROWN IN A SEA
OF DRESSES AND HAIR GEL.

06:57.667 --> 06:59.417
McPHEE.

06:59.417 --> 07:01.250
I DIDN'T KNOW YOU WERE
A CLOSET MOVIE FREAK.

07:01.250 --> 07:03.458
I JUST KIND OF THOUGHT
YOU WERE A FREAK
IN GENERAL.

07:03.458 --> 07:06.917
GHOST. THE WAY WE WERE.
PARDON ME WHILE I GAG.

07:06.917 --> 07:08.583
OH, MY GOD! DUMBO!

07:08.583 --> 07:10.917
OK, SO I HAVE
A GRADE SCHOOL MENTALITY

07:10.917 --> 07:13.083
WHEN IT COMES TO MOVIES.
GET OFF MY BACK.

07:13.083 --> 07:14.959
NO, NO.
I LOVE DUMBO.

07:14.959 --> 07:17.250
YOU LOVE DUMBO?

07:17.250 --> 07:19.583
ARE YOU KIDDING?
IT'S IN MY PANTHEON
OF ALL-TIME FAVORITES.

07:19.583 --> 07:21.083
I CRIED WHEN I SAW IT
AS A KID.

07:21.083 --> 07:24.000
YOU CRIED DURING DUMBO?

07:24.000 --> 07:27.083
ARE YOU JOKING ME?
I BAWLED MY HEAD OFF.

07:27.083 --> 07:29.417
I MEAN, GOD, THE WAY
THOSE OTHER ELEPHANTS
MADE FUN OF HIM

07:29.417 --> 07:30.417
FOR THOSE FAT,
FLOPPY EARS,

07:30.417 --> 07:32.083
AND THEN HE LOSES
HIS MOTHER.

07:32.083 --> 07:34.708
OH, MY LORD. THAT'S
ONE OF THE SADDEST
MOVIES EVER.

07:34.708 --> 07:36.917
THIS IS REALLY STRANGE.

07:36.917 --> 07:38.625
WHAT IS?

07:38.625 --> 07:40.750
WELL, JUST WHEN I'VE
WRITTEN YOU OFF FOR GOOD,

07:40.750 --> 07:43.542
YOU DROP THIS WHOLE
DUMBO  BOMB ON ME.

07:45.625 --> 07:48.959
HEY, YOU KNOW,
I'M OUTTA HERE, AND
I GOT NO PLANS, SO...

07:48.959 --> 07:52.625
WHAT DO YOU SAY WE, UH,
GO OUT, WALK AROUND
TOWN OR SOMETHING?

07:52.625 --> 07:54.291
YEAH, RIGHT.
WHAT'S THE JOKE?

07:54.291 --> 07:56.125
NO JOKE. I GOT NO PLANS.

07:56.125 --> 07:57.959
AND, BELIEVE IT OR NOT,

07:57.959 --> 07:59.917
I'D RATHER SPEND
THE AFTERNOON
EXCHANGING BARBS

07:59.917 --> 08:01.792
WITH A BRAT
LIKE YOURSELF
THAN FLYING SOLO.

08:01.792 --> 08:03.792
SO PINCH YOURSELF.
IT'S YOUR LUCKY DAY.

08:03.792 --> 08:05.542
YOU IN?

08:05.542 --> 08:07.625
WELL, UH, YEAH.
I MIGHT AS WELL.

08:07.625 --> 08:10.250
WELL, UNLESS
YOU HAVE YOUR HEART SET
ON WATCHING DUMBO.

08:10.250 --> 08:13.333
NAH. I'VE SEEN IT,
LIKE, 700 TIMES.

08:13.333 --> 08:14.959
YOU'RE NOT
GONNA THROW ME

08:14.959 --> 08:17.333
IN FRONT OF A BUS
OR ANYTHING, ARE YOU?

08:17.333 --> 08:20.125
THAT'S AN INTERESTING IDEA.
I HADN'T THOUGHT OF THAT.

08:20.125 --> 08:23.500
I'D LIKE TO CLOSE WITH
THIS PIECE, WINTER MIST.

08:23.500 --> 08:25.750
IT'S JARVIS'
MOST FAMOUS WORK.

08:25.750 --> 08:29.166
NO ONE CAN DENY--
AFTER LOOKING AT THIS
EXQUISITELY TUNED SURFACE,

08:29.166 --> 08:31.625
THE JUXTAPOSITIONS
OF COLOR AND SHAPE,

08:31.625 --> 08:33.332
THE VISCERAL INTENSITY
OF HIS LINE--

08:33.332 --> 08:37.125
THAT JARVIS
WAS IN COMPLETE CONTROL
OF HIS NEW TECHNIQUE.

08:37.125 --> 08:40.457
SADLY, 3 WEEKS AFTER JARVIS
COMPLETED WINTER MIST,

08:40.457 --> 08:42.291
HE DIED
FROM ALCOHOL POISONING.

08:42.291 --> 08:44.041
DESPITE HIS UNTIMELY DEATH,

08:44.041 --> 08:46.583
JARVIS LEFT A LASTING
IMPRESSION ON THE ART WORLD,

08:46.583 --> 08:49.875
AND HIS REPUTATION
AS ONE OF THE GREAT
ABSTRACT EXPRESSIONISTS

08:49.875 --> 08:53.834
OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY
WILL LIVE ON. THANK YOU.

08:53.834 --> 08:56.000
[APPLAUSE]

09:03.041 --> 09:05.041
THE LECTURE WAS
GREAT, WASN'T IT?

09:05.041 --> 09:06.750
IT WAS...

09:06.750 --> 09:09.083
CERTAINLY PROLONGED.

09:09.083 --> 09:10.708
YOU HATED IT.

09:10.708 --> 09:14.208
OH, I--NOT AT ALL.
I MEAN, I JUST...
YOU KNOW...

09:14.208 --> 09:17.166
I JUST DON'T THINK
ABSTRACT EXPRESSIONISM
IS REALLY MY THING.

09:17.166 --> 09:18.375
YOUR THING?

09:18.375 --> 09:19.375
YEAH, I JUST,
I DON'T KNOW,

09:19.375 --> 09:20.667
IT JUST SEEMS SO...

09:20.667 --> 09:21.875
UNRESOLVED.

09:21.875 --> 09:23.834
UNRESOLVED?

09:23.834 --> 09:26.667
YEAH, I MEAN,
IT'S JUST A BLOB OF PAINT

09:26.667 --> 09:28.583
THAT OFFERS UP MORE
QUESTIONS THAN ANSWERS.

09:28.583 --> 09:30.542
"A BLOB OF PAINT,"
DAWSON?

09:30.542 --> 09:32.834
WELL, LIKE WINTER MIST,
FOR EXAMPLE.

09:32.834 --> 09:36.917
I MEAN, WHAT IS THE
ULTIMATE EMOTION EXPRESSED
IN THAT PAINTING?

09:36.917 --> 09:39.542
DAWSON, NEWS FLASH:
JUST BECAUSE A PAINTING

09:39.542 --> 09:41.708
DOESN'T HAVE
A BEGINNING, A MIDDLE,
AND AN END,

09:41.708 --> 09:44.583
LIKE SOME ASSEMBLY LINE,
SUMMER-RELEASE
POPCORN MOVIE,

09:44.583 --> 09:48.500
DOES NOT MEAN THAT
IT'S NOT CHARGED
WITH EMOTION, OK?

09:48.500 --> 09:52.041
WELL, I GUESS
I LIKE MY ART
WITH A VERDICT.

09:52.041 --> 09:54.041
SOMETHING
SPECIFIC, CONCISE,
AND TO THE POINT.

09:54.041 --> 09:55.542
LIKE ROMANTICISM.

09:55.542 --> 09:57.041
I CAN TOTALLY
GET INTO ROMANTICISM,

09:57.041 --> 09:58.417
IF YOU KNOW
WHAT I MEAN.

09:58.417 --> 09:59.417
YES, I KNOW
WHAT YOU MEAN.

09:59.417 --> 10:00.875
Laura: HEY, GUYS.

10:00.875 --> 10:03.041
HEY, LAURA. GREAT
LECTURE.

10:03.041 --> 10:04.125
DID YOU REALLY
LIKE IT?

10:04.125 --> 10:04.917
YEAH.
IT WAS AWESOME.

10:04.917 --> 10:06.583
TOMORROW I'M TEACHING
AN ART CLASS.

10:06.583 --> 10:08.458
IF YOU GUYS ARE
INTERESTED IN AUDITING,

10:08.458 --> 10:10.375
YOU'RE MORE THAN WELCOME.
I'VE GOT TO WORK.

10:10.375 --> 10:12.083
Laura: JOEY,
HOW ABOUT YOU?

10:12.083 --> 10:15.250
I'M AFRAID MY
ARTISTIC SKILLS PEAKED
IN THE THIRD GRADE.

10:15.250 --> 10:16.708
OH, IT'S
A BEGINNER'S CLASS.

10:16.708 --> 10:18.667
YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE
PICASSO, JUST WILLING.

10:22.708 --> 10:25.250
THIS TRUCK LITERALLY
APPEARED OUT OF NOWHERE,

10:25.250 --> 10:28.125
AND I DIDN'T SEE IT, AND NOW
MY SAAB'S BACK IN THE SHOP.

10:28.125 --> 10:29.917
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU
HAD ANOTHER ACCIDENT.

10:29.917 --> 10:32.125
YOU ARE OFFICIALLY THE
WORLD'S WORST DRIVER.

10:32.125 --> 10:33.250
PACEY?

10:35.458 --> 10:37.041
PACEY, WHAT IS IT?

10:40.250 --> 10:42.625
HELLO, PACEY.

10:42.625 --> 10:45.959
AREN'T YOU GOING
TO INTRODUCE ME
TO YOUR FRIEND?

10:49.291 --> 10:52.166
HI. TAMARA JACOBS.

10:52.166 --> 10:54.333
NICE TO MEET YOU.
I'M ANDIE.

10:54.333 --> 10:57.625
PACEY WAS A FORMER
STUDENT OF MINE.

10:57.625 --> 10:59.083
YEAH, UH...

10:59.083 --> 11:00.291
I WAS HER TEACHER AND--

11:00.291 --> 11:02.917
NO, I WAS HER STUDENT

11:02.917 --> 11:04.708
AND SHE WAS MY TEACHER.

11:07.792 --> 11:10.458
WELL, I'M LATE
FOR AN APPOINTMENT.

11:10.458 --> 11:12.750
IT WAS REALLY NICE
TO SEE YOU, PACEY.

11:12.750 --> 11:16.000
YEAH, LIKEWISE.

11:17.625 --> 11:20.542
AND NICE
TO MEET YOU, ANDIE.

11:20.542 --> 11:23.125
TAKE CARE.

11:25.458 --> 11:28.834
PACEY, WHAT'S THE MATTER?
YOU LOOK LIKE YOU'VE SEEN
A GHOST.

11:28.834 --> 11:32.959
UM...NO. IT'S JUST
I HAVEN'T SEEN HER
IN A WHILE,

11:32.959 --> 11:34.917
AND SHE WAS
MY TEACHER.

11:34.917 --> 11:38.667
YOUR TEACHER. DID SHE
FLUNK YOU OR SOMETHING?

11:38.667 --> 11:42.041
NO, NO. UH...LISTEN.
YOU KNOW WHAT, ANDIE?

11:42.041 --> 11:44.834
I THINK I'M GOING
TO HAVE TO TAKE
A RAIN CHECK ON THIS.

11:44.834 --> 11:46.875
I'M REALLY SORRY,
BUT I GOTTA GO, OK?

11:46.875 --> 11:49.667
WHAT? ARE YOU SERIOUS?

12:09.750 --> 12:11.375
I'M ONTO YOU, JOEY.

12:11.375 --> 12:13.417
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

12:13.417 --> 12:16.083
HOW MANY OTHER TALENTS
HAVE YOU BEEN HIDING
FROM ME?

12:16.083 --> 12:18.166
PLEASE. IT'S AN APPLE
AND A BANANA.

12:18.166 --> 12:20.208
IT'S HARDLY
THE SECOND COMING.

12:20.208 --> 12:22.542
YOU CAN BE AS
SELF-DEPRECATING
AS YOU WANT.

12:22.542 --> 12:24.375
DOESN'T CHANGE
THE FACT THAT YOU'RE
A NATURAL.

12:24.375 --> 12:25.667
YOU, MY FRIEND,
HAVE A GIFT.

12:25.667 --> 12:28.375
I CAN FEEL MY HEAD SWELLING
AS YOU SPEAK.

12:28.375 --> 12:29.875
DO YOU DRAW MUCH?

12:29.875 --> 12:31.583
UH, WHEN I WAS LITTLE,
I DID.

12:31.583 --> 12:34.583
I WANTED TO BE LIKE MY MOM.
SHE WAS AN ARTIST.

12:34.583 --> 12:36.792
WAS? WHY DID SHE STOP?

12:36.792 --> 12:40.875
SHE, UH--SHE DIDN'T.
SHE, UH--

12:40.875 --> 12:43.083
SHE DIED.

12:43.083 --> 12:45.583
OH, I'M SO SORRY, JOEY.

12:45.583 --> 12:48.041
THAT MUST HAVE BEEN...

12:48.041 --> 12:49.458
INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT.

12:51.083 --> 12:53.083
WHEN?

12:53.083 --> 12:55.291
A FEW YEARS AGO.
SHE HAD BREAST CANCER.

12:55.291 --> 12:59.542
SHE WAS AN ARTIST?

12:59.542 --> 13:01.417
SORT OF. I MEAN,
SHE TAUGHT HERSELF.

13:01.417 --> 13:02.917
SHE WASN'T
A PROFESSIONAL
LIKE YOU.

13:02.917 --> 13:05.708
SHE JUST KIND OF...
DID IT FOR FUN.

13:07.959 --> 13:11.041
I REMEMBER SHE USED
TO DRAW PICTURES FROM
MY FAVORITE STORIES

13:11.041 --> 13:12.417
AND HANG THEM IN MY ROOM.

13:12.417 --> 13:14.792
[CHUCKLES]

13:14.792 --> 13:17.208
SO, ART MUST BE
IN YOUR GENES?

13:19.583 --> 13:21.792
I DON'T KNOW. I GUESS.

13:21.792 --> 13:23.959
WELL, IF YOU ENJOY
THIS, JOEY,

13:23.959 --> 13:25.625
I THINK THAT YOU SHOULD
REALLY PURSUE IT.

13:25.625 --> 13:28.458
I COULD RECOMMEND
SOME GREAT CLASSES.

13:28.458 --> 13:30.417
OK, WHY THE LOOK?

13:30.417 --> 13:32.458
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

13:32.458 --> 13:34.333
I'M VERY SERIOUS.

13:34.333 --> 13:37.208
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU SHOULD TAKE YOURSELF
A LITTLE MORE SERIOUSLY.

13:37.208 --> 13:39.125
I MEAN, I MAY NOT BE
A GREAT ARTIST,

13:39.125 --> 13:40.625
BUT I LIKE TO THINK
I HAVE AN EYE,

13:40.625 --> 13:43.625
AND MY EYE
SAYS YOU'RE GOOD.

13:43.625 --> 13:46.625
WHY, WHEN YOU SAY THAT,
DO I SUDDENLY FEEL
OVERCOME WITH ANXIETY?

13:46.625 --> 13:48.667
BECAUSE WITH TALENT
COMES RESPONSIBILITY.

13:48.667 --> 13:50.250
AND YOU OWE IT
TO YOURSELF

13:50.250 --> 13:51.917
NOT TO LET THIS TALENT
GO TO WASTE.

13:56.125 --> 13:57.667
BE RIGHT THERE.

14:02.166 --> 14:03.667
HEY, DAWSON.

14:03.667 --> 14:07.041
ANDIE. HEY.
COME ON IN.

14:07.041 --> 14:11.458
I'M JUST--
I'M HAVING
A DOMESTIC SPELL.

14:11.458 --> 14:13.333
WHAT ARE YOU--WHAT
ARE YOU DOING HERE?

14:13.333 --> 14:15.542
UH, WHAT AM I
DOING HERE?

14:15.542 --> 14:17.792
I WAS IN
THE NEIGHBORHOOD,

14:17.792 --> 14:20.875
AND I WAS WONDERING WHAT
THE ENGLISH ASSIGNMENT
IS FOR MONDAY.

14:20.875 --> 14:23.333
SO I THOUGHT YOU
MIGHT KNOW, AND...

14:23.333 --> 14:24.708
HERE I AM.

14:24.708 --> 14:26.500
IT'S THE FIRST CHAPTER
OF GULLIVER'S TRAVELS.

14:26.500 --> 14:28.208
COOL. GREAT.

14:28.208 --> 14:30.125
I'M GOING TO GO HOME
NOW AND READ IT.
THANKS.

14:30.125 --> 14:33.166
ANDIE? ANDIE?

14:33.166 --> 14:35.291
ARE YOU SURE THAT'S
WHY YOU CAME BY?

14:38.542 --> 14:41.083
I DON'T REALLY
KNOW YOU, DAWSON, BUT...

14:41.083 --> 14:43.708
IF I ASK YOU
SOMETHING,

14:43.708 --> 14:46.166
DO YOU SWEAR THAT
YOU'LL KEEP IT IN THE
STRICTEST OF CONFIDENCE?

14:46.166 --> 14:48.041
YEAH. ABSOLUTELY.

14:48.041 --> 14:49.166
HAS...

14:50.542 --> 14:54.625
PACEY SAID ANYTHING
TO YOU ABOUT...

14:54.625 --> 14:56.875
POSSIBLY LIKING SOMEONE?

14:56.875 --> 14:58.834
LIKING SOMEONE?

14:58.834 --> 15:00.000
LIKING WHO?

15:00.000 --> 15:05.375
LIKING...OOH,
I DON'T KNOW. ME?

15:05.375 --> 15:07.250
UH, NOT THAT I RECALL.

15:07.250 --> 15:09.041
OH.

15:09.041 --> 15:10.875
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN
HE DOESN'T LIKE YOU.

15:10.875 --> 15:12.083
HE COULD
VERY WELL LIKE YOU.

15:12.083 --> 15:13.792
HE JUST DOESN'T
SAY ANYTHING TO ME.

15:13.792 --> 15:17.041
WHY? DO YOU--
DO YOU LIKE HIM?

15:17.041 --> 15:18.917
ME? LIKE PACEY?

15:18.917 --> 15:21.417
NO WAY...WELL...

15:21.417 --> 15:24.959
MAYBE. POSSIBLY.

15:24.959 --> 15:27.375
WHY DON'T YOU JUST...
TELL HIM?

15:27.375 --> 15:30.417
I COULD NEVER,
EVER TELL PACEY THAT.

15:30.417 --> 15:33.583
I MEAN, HE'S A PIG.
HE'S OBNOXIOUS.

15:33.583 --> 15:35.417
THERE'S JUST NO WAY.

15:35.417 --> 15:37.959
AND YOU HAVE TO SWEAR
TO ME THAT YOU WILL NOT
TELL HIM EITHER.

15:37.959 --> 15:40.458
WHY DO I FEEL LIKE
I'M IN SECOND GRADE?

15:40.458 --> 15:42.750
DAWSON, PLEASE.

15:42.750 --> 15:45.166
OK, I WON'T SAY A WORD,
I SWEAR.

15:45.166 --> 15:47.959
BUT I'VE KNOWN PACEY
A LONG TIME,

15:47.959 --> 15:51.917
AND THAT OBNOXIOUS PIG
BEHAVIOR IS SOMETIMES
HIS ATTEMPT AT FLIRTATION.

15:51.917 --> 15:52.959
REALLY?

15:52.959 --> 15:54.917
YEAH.

15:56.542 --> 15:58.375
OK.

15:58.375 --> 16:00.458
THANKS. I'LL
SEE YOU AROUND.

16:06.458 --> 16:08.583
NOW, THAT WAS WHAT I CALL
A SHOPPING SPREE.

16:08.583 --> 16:10.959
I CAN'T BELIEVE
I BLEW MY ENTIRE
MONTHLY ALLOWANCE

16:10.959 --> 16:12.291
IN LESS THAN 20 MINUTES.

16:12.291 --> 16:14.291
THAT IS A RECORD
FOR ME, I THINK.

16:14.291 --> 16:16.417
HOW ARE YOU GOING TO EXPLAIN
IT TO YOUR PARENTS?

16:16.417 --> 16:17.458
THE USUAL.

16:17.458 --> 16:18.667
I GOT MUGGED.

16:18.667 --> 16:20.333
IN CAPESIDE?

16:20.333 --> 16:22.708
YOU ARE CRAZY.

16:22.708 --> 16:24.750
YOU LOVE ME, RIGHT?

16:24.750 --> 16:28.291
I MEAN, THIS MORNING
YOU HAD THAT WHOLE
HUNG-JAWED,

16:28.291 --> 16:30.166
WOE-IS-JEN THING,
BUT NOW LOOK AT YOU.

16:30.166 --> 16:31.959
YOU'RE SMILING,
YOU'RE LAUGHING,

16:31.959 --> 16:34.291
YOU'VE GOT
NEW LIPSTICK.

16:34.291 --> 16:35.583
AREN'T YOU GLAD
YOU MET ME?

16:35.583 --> 16:37.834
YOU KNOW WHAT I AM?

16:37.834 --> 16:41.500
I MEAN, I LEFT NEW YORK
BECAUSE I COULDN'T HANDLE
BEING THE BAD GIRL ANYMORE,

16:41.500 --> 16:47.000
BUT, I TELL YOU,
IF BEING THE BAD GIRL
MEANS NOT WALKING AROUND

16:47.000 --> 16:49.375
IN A PERPETUAL
STATE OF LONELINESS
AND DEPRESSION,

16:49.375 --> 16:50.834
THEN BAD GIRL IT IS.

16:50.834 --> 16:55.667
I'M GLAD I'M GETTING YOU
BACK TO YOUR ROOTS.

16:55.667 --> 16:59.667
OH, MY GOD!
JEN, DON'T LOOK NOW,

16:59.667 --> 17:01.708
BUT THE BIGGEST BABE
I'VE EVER SEEN
IN MY LIFE

17:01.708 --> 17:04.040
IS SITTING
RIGHT BEHIND YOU.

17:05.666 --> 17:07.500
MINE. I CALLED HIM.

17:07.500 --> 17:09.040
NO WAY, ABBY.
LOOK AT THE GUY.

17:09.040 --> 17:11.000
HE'S, LIKE,
TWICE YOUR AGE.

17:11.000 --> 17:13.500
PERFECT. THAT MEANS HE'S
ALMOST MATURE ENOUGH
TO HANDLE ME.

17:13.500 --> 17:15.500
I'M SO SICK OF
THESE LITTLE BOYS.

17:15.500 --> 17:16.625
I NEED A REAL MAN,

17:16.625 --> 17:18.791
WITH CHEST HAIR
AND BODY ODOR

17:18.791 --> 17:21.875
AND ILLEGITIMATE
CHILDREN SCATTERED
ACROSS THE COUNTRY.

17:24.040 --> 17:26.000
EXCUSE ME.

17:26.000 --> 17:29.417
HI, UH, WHAT'S
YOUR NAME?

17:29.417 --> 17:30.667
Shut up.

17:30.667 --> 17:32.542
VINCENT.

17:32.542 --> 17:35.917
HI, VINCENT.
I'M ABBY, AND THIS
IS MY FRIEND JEN.

17:35.917 --> 17:38.667
SO YOU'RE EATING ALONE?

17:38.667 --> 17:40.542
WELL, YOU'RE WELCOME
TO COME JOIN US.

17:40.542 --> 17:42.875
WE DON'T BITE,
UNLESS WE'RE ASKED TO.

17:42.875 --> 17:44.708
I'D LOVE TO JOIN
YOU LADIES,

17:44.708 --> 17:46.917
BUT I HAVE TO GET
TO THE DOCKS.

17:46.917 --> 17:49.250
THE DOCKS? WHAT DO YOU
DO THERE, SUNBATHE?

17:49.250 --> 17:51.708
I'M A FISHERMAN.

17:51.708 --> 17:55.208
GOT A 2-MONTH STINT
ON A LONG-LINER,
HAULING SWORDFISH.

17:55.208 --> 17:58.500
OH, SO YOU'RE NOT
FROM CAPESIDE?

17:58.500 --> 18:01.041
WELL, IF YOU EVER WANT
SOMEBODY TO SHOW YOU
THE SIGHTS,

18:01.041 --> 18:02.375
GIVE ME A CALL.

18:02.375 --> 18:06.083
ABBY MORGAN. 555-4026.

18:06.083 --> 18:08.208
THANKS FOR THE OFFER.

18:11.125 --> 18:14.166
I DIDN'T CATCH YOUR NAME.

18:14.166 --> 18:16.959
JEN.
JEN.

18:16.959 --> 18:19.583
IT'S NICE MEETING YOU, JEN.

18:19.583 --> 18:21.458
YOU, TOO.

18:24.250 --> 18:26.208
Dawson: HEY, YOU.

18:26.208 --> 18:27.166
HI.

18:28.875 --> 18:30.208
WHAT'S UP?

18:30.208 --> 18:32.083
NOTHING.

18:32.083 --> 18:35.083
THAT'S NOT NOTHING.
WHAT IS IT?

18:35.083 --> 18:36.875
IT'S A SKETCH PAD.
I WAS JUST DOODLING.

18:36.875 --> 18:37.917
IT'S NO BIG DEAL.

18:37.917 --> 18:39.875
WELL, WHAT WERE YOU
DOODLING?

18:39.875 --> 18:42.083
WELL, IF YOU MUST KNOW,
A BOWL OF FRUIT.

18:42.083 --> 18:44.750
IT WAS SOMETHING
I WAS WORKING ON
IN LAURA'S CLASS.

18:44.750 --> 18:46.583
A BOWL OF FRUIT?

18:46.583 --> 18:49.667
YOU'RE REALLY GETTING
INTO THIS WHOLE ART THING.

18:49.667 --> 18:50.917
WELL, LET'S SEE IT.

18:50.917 --> 18:51.959
NO!

18:51.959 --> 18:53.250
COME ON.
I DON'T THINK SO.

18:53.250 --> 18:54.417
WHY NOT?

18:54.417 --> 18:56.625
I LIKE THIS
NEW ART INTEREST.

18:56.625 --> 19:00.375
YOU KNOW, JOEY POTTER:
ARTIST EXTRAORDINAIRE,

19:00.375 --> 19:01.834
EMPRESS OF
ALL IMPRESSIONISM,

19:01.834 --> 19:03.625
MASTER OF STILL LIFE.

19:03.625 --> 19:06.291
I HEREBY DECLARE
MYSELF A FULL-FLEDGED,
MADLY ENTHUSIASTIC FAN

19:06.291 --> 19:08.708
OF YOUR NEW HOBBY.

19:10.792 --> 19:15.625
DAWSON, WHY IS IT YOUR
OBSESSION WITH MOVIES
IS YOUR LIFE PASSION,

19:15.625 --> 19:17.417
WHILE MY INTEREST
IN ART IS A HOBBY?

19:17.417 --> 19:19.875
DAH! I KNEW--I KNEW
AS SOON AS I SAID "HOBBY,"

19:19.875 --> 19:21.250
THAT IT WAS THE WRONG WORD,

19:21.250 --> 19:23.291
BUT BY THE TIME I SAID IT,
IT WAS ALREADY--

19:23.291 --> 19:25.500
IT WAS GONE, AND THERE
WAS NO GETTING IT BACK.

19:25.500 --> 19:27.041
YOU KNOW, I REALLY HAVE
TO FINISH UP, SO...

19:27.041 --> 19:30.000
I'LL SEE YOU LATER.

19:30.000 --> 19:31.834
WELL, SO YOU'RE JUST GOING
TO LEAVE IT LIKE THIS?

19:31.834 --> 19:33.041
LIKE WHAT? UNRESOLVED?

19:33.041 --> 19:34.834
YEAH.

19:34.834 --> 19:37.208
WHY DON'T YOU
JUST CONSIDER ME
A NONSPECIFIC,

19:37.208 --> 19:38.834
INCOHERENT,
EXPRESSIONISTIC
PAINTING?

19:42.291 --> 19:44.542
HAVE A GREAT DAY,
DAWSON.

20:14.041 --> 20:15.458
HI.

20:15.458 --> 20:19.041
HI.

20:19.041 --> 20:21.750
I WAS DEBATING
WHETHER OR NOT I SHOULD
ACTUALLY DO THIS--

20:21.750 --> 20:25.208
UH, THE "THIS" BEING
COMING OUT TO SEE YOU
'CAUSE...

20:25.208 --> 20:29.375
YOU KNOW, WHEN WE SAID
"HI" YESTERDAY, IT WAS,
UH, A LITTLE...

20:29.375 --> 20:31.041
AWKWARD.

20:31.041 --> 20:33.667
AND I DON'T KNOW,
I JUST THOUGHT THAT
I SHOULD COME--

20:33.667 --> 20:34.542
PACEY?

20:34.542 --> 20:36.041
YEAH?

20:36.041 --> 20:40.667
IT WAS SUPPOSED
TO FEEL AWKWARD.

20:40.667 --> 20:43.625
HOW ABOUT THIS?
IS THIS SUPPOSED TO
FEEL AWKWARD, TOO?

20:43.625 --> 20:46.834
MM-HMM.

20:46.834 --> 20:49.333
AND IF WE WERE
TO SEE EACH OTHER
A THIRD TIME?

20:50.708 --> 20:53.083
OH, STILL AWKWARD.

20:53.083 --> 20:54.792
OH, GOOD. WELL...

20:54.792 --> 20:56.708
AT LEAST THERE'S
A SCIENCE TO THIS
THEN.

20:56.708 --> 21:00.250
YES. IT'S WHAT WE
EX-ENGLISH TEACHERS CALL

21:00.250 --> 21:02.417
A CLASSIC "PINTER" MOMENT,

21:02.417 --> 21:04.708
WHERE EVERYTHING IS SAID...

21:04.708 --> 21:07.875
IN SILENCE...

21:07.875 --> 21:11.166
BECAUSE THE EMOTION
BEHIND WHAT WE REALLY
WANT TO SAY IS JUST...

21:12.750 --> 21:14.834
TOO OVERWHELMING.

21:17.250 --> 21:18.750
AND, UH...

21:18.750 --> 21:20.208
THAT'S WHAT
WE'RE HAVING...

21:20.208 --> 21:23.125
A "PINTER" MOMENT.

21:23.125 --> 21:24.625
YES.

21:28.125 --> 21:29.333
THAT'S OK WITH YOU?

21:31.625 --> 21:34.291
WELL, SILENCE
IS AN ACQUIRED TASTE.

21:34.291 --> 21:36.583
THE MORE COMPLICATED
LIFE BECOMES,

21:36.583 --> 21:41.959
THE BETTER IT IS
TO LEARN TO SAY NOTHING.

21:41.959 --> 21:43.291
OK.

21:45.417 --> 21:49.792
THEN, UH, MAYBE WE
COULD HAVE JUST

21:49.792 --> 21:52.166
A COUPLE MORE SECONDS
OF SILENCE?

21:52.166 --> 21:54.166
SURE.

22:08.250 --> 22:11.291
WHO WAS
THIS PINTER GUY?

22:11.291 --> 22:14.291
STAY IN SCHOOL, PACEY.

22:17.959 --> 22:20.625
YES, MS. JACOBS.

22:43.000 --> 22:44.333
Mitch: WANT
SOME BREAKFAST?

22:44.333 --> 22:45.458
NO. I'LL JUST
HAVE SOME JUICE.

22:45.458 --> 22:46.500
I GOTTA GO FIND JOEY.

22:46.500 --> 22:48.166
HOW ARE
THE TWO LOVEBIRDS?

22:48.166 --> 22:52.041
UM, GOOD...
I THINK.

22:52.041 --> 22:54.542
THIS ART OBSESSION
IS MAKING JOEY
A LITTLE CRAZY.

22:54.542 --> 22:57.208
I CAN'T DO OR SAY
ANYTHING RIGHT.

22:57.208 --> 22:59.542
I MADE THE MISTAKE
OF TEASING HER ABOUT
THIS ART LECTURE,

22:59.542 --> 23:01.417
SHE WENT SYBIL
ON ME.

23:01.417 --> 23:03.667
WELL, IN MY
EXPERIENCE, DAWSON,

23:03.667 --> 23:06.083
ERRATIC BEHAVIOR OF
THE FEMALE ORIENTATION

23:06.083 --> 23:09.667
USUALLY MEANS
THE ROOT OF THE PROBLEM
IS SOMETHING UNEXPECTED.

23:09.667 --> 23:11.667
IT'S PROBABLY
NOT ABOUT ART.

23:11.667 --> 23:13.875
GO FIND OUT
WHAT IT IS.

23:13.875 --> 23:16.542
IS THIS YOUR
FATHER KNOWS BEST
MOMENT?

23:16.542 --> 23:20.000
OH, I HAVE ONE IN ME
EVERY NOW AND THEN.

23:21.875 --> 23:23.917
FIND HER.

23:23.917 --> 23:25.625
TALK TO HER.
ALL RIGHT. THANKS.

23:25.625 --> 23:26.875
HELLO.
HEY, PACEY!

23:26.875 --> 23:30.250
THE MAN, THE MYTH,
THE LEGEND.

23:30.250 --> 23:33.667
LISTEN, DAWSON, THAT
LITTLE SECRET YOU HAD
YESTERDAY--TAMARA?

23:33.667 --> 23:35.750
YOU REALLY
SHOULD'VE TOLD ME.

23:35.750 --> 23:36.917
I TRIED TO TELL YOU.

23:36.917 --> 23:40.041
YOU WERE OFF AND
DOWN THE HALL BEFORE
I COULD GET IT OUT.

23:40.041 --> 23:41.959
WELL, YOU SEE, WE GOT
A SITUATION HERE NOW

23:41.959 --> 23:43.625
BECAUSE I REALIZED
LAST NIGHT

23:43.625 --> 23:45.333
THAT I'M NOT
ENTIRELY OVER HER.

23:46.542 --> 23:48.333
OH, BOY. UM...

23:50.250 --> 23:51.750
PACEY, I'M YOUR FRIEND,

23:51.750 --> 23:54.583
AND I WANT TO BE
SUPPORTIVE AND HELPFUL,

23:54.583 --> 23:57.291
BUT...THE ONLY THING
I CAN THINK OF

23:57.291 --> 24:00.250
TO SAY TO YOU
IN GOOD CONSCIENCE
IS STAY AWAY.

24:00.250 --> 24:02.750
YOU HAVEN'T EVEN
FULLY RECOVERED FROM
THE GOSSIP FALLOUT

24:02.750 --> 24:05.708
OF YOUR LAST
COMPLETELY ILLEGAL
INTERLUDE.

24:05.708 --> 24:07.583
THERE ARE GIRLS YOUR AGE.

24:07.583 --> 24:09.417
THERE ARE GIRLS
WHO LIKE YOU.

24:09.417 --> 24:11.750
WOULD IT BE SO TERRIBLE
IF YOU FELL FOR
ONE OF THEM?

24:11.750 --> 24:13.041
LIKE WHO?

24:13.041 --> 24:15.625
LIKE THE ONE WHO
CAME TO MY HOUSE
YESTERDAY

24:15.625 --> 24:17.708
AND TOLD ME
THAT SHE LIKED YOU.

24:17.708 --> 24:19.041
WHO?

24:19.041 --> 24:20.500
I'M NOT SUPPOSED
TO SAY.

24:20.500 --> 24:21.917
DAWSON, I'M NOT
IN THE MOOD. WHO?

24:21.917 --> 24:23.458
ANDIE.
ANDIE LIKES YOU.

24:23.458 --> 24:25.625
ANDIE HATES ME.

24:25.625 --> 24:27.500
WHEN A GIRL HATES YOU
THE WAY ANDIE HATES YOU,

24:27.500 --> 24:28.959
IT REALLY MEANS
THAT SHE LIKES YOU.

24:28.959 --> 24:31.125
THAT'S BASIC
KINDERGARTEN PSYCHOLOGY.

24:31.125 --> 24:32.917
YEAH, BUT THAT'S
DIFFERENT, DAWSON.

24:32.917 --> 24:34.750
ANDIE'S
A GIRL, OK?

24:34.750 --> 24:38.291
AND TAMARA--
TAMARA'S A WOMAN.

24:38.291 --> 24:40.667
EXACTLY. PACEY, YOU
SHOULD BE WITH A GIRL.

24:42.667 --> 24:46.917
OK, LOOK, I GOTTA GO,
AND I'M REALLY SORRY...

24:46.917 --> 24:51.083
BUT...I'M BEGGING YOU,
AS YOUR FRIEND...

24:51.083 --> 24:52.458
DON'T GO THERE.

24:59.250 --> 25:02.000
HEY, BESSIE,
YOU THINK I COULD
HAVE THE DAY OFF

25:02.000 --> 25:03.667
SINCE THERE'S
NOBODY HERE,

25:03.667 --> 25:05.500
AND THERE'S THIS
HUGE ART EXHIBIT
AT THE COLLEGE

25:05.500 --> 25:06.625
I'M DYING TO GO SEE?

25:06.625 --> 25:08.667
SURE. I'LL HOLD
DOWN THE FORT.

25:08.667 --> 25:10.834
YOU ARE, WITHOUT A DOUBT,
MY FAVORITE SISTER.

25:10.834 --> 25:12.708
I'M YOUR
ONLY SISTER.

25:12.708 --> 25:14.667
AND HEY, JOEY,
THIS PLACE IS DEAD.

25:14.667 --> 25:16.667
WHY DON'T YOU TAKE
JACK WITH YOU?

25:16.667 --> 25:18.375
THERE'S PRICELESS ART
AT THIS EXHIBIT.

25:18.375 --> 25:19.792
HE COULD DO
SOME SERIOUS DAMAGE.

25:19.792 --> 25:22.834
JUST TAKE HIM.
I FEEL SORRY FOR HIM.

25:22.834 --> 25:25.250
HE JUST SITS AROUND
LOOKING DOPEY.

25:26.875 --> 25:28.667
HEY, JACK...

25:28.667 --> 25:31.208
DO YOU KNOW
WHAT AN ART
EXHIBIT IS?

25:31.208 --> 25:33.041
HEH...YEAH.

25:33.041 --> 25:35.208
DO YOU WANNA
GO TO ONE?

25:36.792 --> 25:38.000
SURE.

25:39.458 --> 25:41.166
THIS SHOULD BE
ENTERTAINING.

25:50.333 --> 25:52.375
IT'S A GREAT SPACE.

25:52.375 --> 25:54.917
LOCATION'S IDEAL.

25:54.917 --> 25:57.291
WITH A LITTLE WORK,
OF COURSE.

25:57.291 --> 26:00.417
WELL, I PROBABLY
SHOULDN'T BE TELLING A
PROSPECTIVE BUYER THIS,

26:00.417 --> 26:03.208
BUT I AM EAGER
TO SELL, SO...

26:03.208 --> 26:05.708
YOU'RE GONNA GET
A GOOD DEAL.

26:05.708 --> 26:09.000
TRYING TO OUTRUN SOME
FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES?

26:09.000 --> 26:11.000
EH-HEH...

26:11.000 --> 26:14.500
WE BOTH KNOW MY PROBLEMS
WEREN'T STRICTLY FINANCIAL.

26:16.083 --> 26:19.083
YEAH, WELL, SINCE...
YOU BROUGHT IT UP...

26:19.083 --> 26:21.041
UM...

26:21.041 --> 26:23.333
A STUDENT,
WASN'T IT?

26:24.750 --> 26:26.792
YES, SOMETHING
LIKE THAT.

26:28.750 --> 26:32.208
UM...THE CEILING
NEEDS FIXING UP,

26:32.208 --> 26:34.667
BUT THE WINDOWS
ARE COMPLETELY NEW.

26:35.417 --> 26:36.750
FROM WHAT I'VE HEARD,

26:36.750 --> 26:40.041
YOU'RE NO STRANGER
TO SCANDAL YOURSELF.

26:40.041 --> 26:42.375
ONLY IF YOUR
DEFINITION OF SCANDAL

26:42.375 --> 26:45.583
INCLUDES YOUR WIFE
HAVING AN AFFAIR
WITH HER CO-ANCHOR...

26:45.583 --> 26:47.750
BUT IF YOU
DON'T MIND, UH,

26:47.750 --> 26:51.083
I'D LIKE TO GIVE
THAT IMAGE A REST
FOR THE AFTERNOON.

26:51.083 --> 26:52.792
UNDERSTOOD.

26:55.250 --> 26:58.708
ABBY, WE'VE BEEN
PACING THESE DOCKS
FOR, LIKE, 2 HOURS.

26:58.708 --> 27:00.333
WHAT ARE WE
STILL DOING HERE?

27:00.333 --> 27:02.291
I'M STARTING TO FEEL
KIND OF STUPID.

27:02.291 --> 27:05.208
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
WE'RE LOOKING
FOR VINCENT.

27:05.208 --> 27:06.458
WHO?
VINCENT.

27:06.458 --> 27:08.750
THE FISHERMAN?
THE BABE?

27:08.750 --> 27:10.291
WE'RE ON
HUNK PATROL.

27:10.291 --> 27:13.125
OH, MY GOD.
ABBY, YOU'VE GOTTA
BE KIDDING ME.

27:13.125 --> 27:15.750
THERE'S GOTTA BE,
LIKE, A HUNDRED
DIFFERENT BOATS HERE.

27:15.750 --> 27:17.458
WE HAVE NO IDEA
WHICH ONE HE'S
WORKING ON.

27:17.458 --> 27:19.500
WE'RE NOT GONNA
FIND HIM.

27:19.500 --> 27:21.291
AND, YEAH, HE MAY BE
GOOD-LOOKING,

27:21.291 --> 27:23.125
BUT HE'S OLD ENOUGH
TO BE YOUR FATHER.

27:23.125 --> 27:24.959
HAVEN'T YOU EVER HEARD
OF STATUTORY RAPE?

27:24.959 --> 27:26.792
OH, SHUT UP.

27:26.792 --> 27:28.083
WE DON'T HAVE
TO STAY LONG.

27:28.083 --> 27:29.500
I JUST WANNA TAKE
A LOOK AROUND.

27:29.500 --> 27:32.250
I KNOW THIS MUST BE
INCREDIBLY BORING
FOR YOU.

27:32.250 --> 27:35.750
BORING? JARVIS
IS, LIKE, MY ALL-TIME
FAVORITE EXPRESSIONIST.

27:35.750 --> 27:37.417
YOUR FAVORITE
EXPRESSIONIST?

27:37.417 --> 27:40.000
YEAH. YOU KNOW
ABOUT HIM?

27:40.000 --> 27:42.500
JUST THAT HE WAS
AN ALCOHOLIC AND
HE DIED YOUNG.

27:42.500 --> 27:44.375
AND HE WAS A GENIUS.

27:44.375 --> 27:46.500
LOOK--AMAZING PAINTER.

27:46.500 --> 27:49.500
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?
HE WAS SEVERELY
MANIC-DEPRESSIVE.

27:49.500 --> 27:51.667
SO, LIKE, HALF
OF HIS PAINTINGS
ARE ALL...

27:51.667 --> 27:54.667
WELL, CHAOTIC
AND--AND COLORFUL,

27:54.667 --> 27:55.834
AND THE OTHER HALF--

27:55.834 --> 27:58.458
THE OTHER HALF
ARE, LIKE, REAL...

27:58.458 --> 28:01.792
SUGGESTIVE, YOU KNOW?

28:01.792 --> 28:03.333
BUT THIS--THIS ONE.

28:03.333 --> 28:05.667
THIS IS HIS
MOST FAMOUS PAINTING--

28:05.667 --> 28:07.959
WINTER MIST.

28:07.959 --> 28:11.500
I--I LOVE IT WHEN
A PAINTING CAN REALLY
AFFECT YOU EMOTIONALLY.

28:11.500 --> 28:14.583
I MEAN...I FIND THIS ONE
REALLY INTENSE.

28:16.000 --> 28:17.583
WHAT?

28:17.583 --> 28:21.125
WHAT--WHAT ARE
YOU LOOKING AT?

28:21.125 --> 28:23.667
NOTHING. I--
I JUST HAD NO IDEA

28:23.667 --> 28:26.333
YOU WERE SUCH
AN ART CONNOISSEUR.

28:26.333 --> 28:28.542
WHAT, YOU THINK
MY ONLY TALENTS
ARE WAITING TABLES?

28:28.542 --> 28:30.291
NO, 'CAUSE IF THAT
WAS YOUR ONLY TALENT,

28:30.291 --> 28:32.041
THEN YOU'D BE
COMPLETELY TALENTLESS.

28:32.041 --> 28:33.917
OH, HO HO HO!
I SEE.

28:33.917 --> 28:36.542
SO, NOT ONLY ARE YOU
SHOCKED TO FIND OUT I
HAVE A BRAIN IN MY HEAD.

28:36.542 --> 28:38.542
YOU THINK I'M A TERRIBLE
WAITER ON TOP OF IT?

28:38.542 --> 28:40.041
YOU KNOW YOU'RE
A SUCKY WAITER, JACK.

28:40.041 --> 28:42.333
NO WAY! I'M AWESOME!

28:45.041 --> 28:48.250
ALL RIGHT. MAYBE,
EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE,
I MESS UP AN ORDER--

28:48.250 --> 28:49.875
JACK, "EVERY
ONCE IN A WHILE"?

28:49.875 --> 28:51.875
YOU'RE A WALKING
SIGHT GAG.

28:51.875 --> 28:53.041
SIGHT GAG?

28:53.041 --> 28:54.708
YEAH.

28:54.708 --> 28:59.041
HUH...WELL, I GUESS
THAT'S ONE WAY OF
LOOKING AT ME.

28:59.041 --> 29:01.250
BUT JUST LIKE IF
SOME SHALLOW PERSON

29:01.250 --> 29:03.250
STUMBLED ACROSS
ALL THESE PAINTINGS

29:03.250 --> 29:06.708
AND LABELED THEM,
LIKE...I DON'T KNOW.

29:06.708 --> 29:09.500
MESSY...
OR MEANINGLESS...
YOU KNOW?

29:09.500 --> 29:11.834
BUT IF YOU STARE
AT THE IMAGES
LONG ENOUGH,

29:11.834 --> 29:14.041
YOU CAN SEE
THEY'RE FILLED
WITH GREAT POWER

29:14.041 --> 29:15.291
AND PASSION...

29:17.083 --> 29:18.834
INTELLIGENCE.

29:22.583 --> 29:24.917
I'M SORRY, JACK.

29:24.917 --> 29:26.458
FOR WHAT?

29:26.458 --> 29:28.792
FOR JUMPING TO
THE WRONG CONCLUSIONS.

29:28.792 --> 29:32.458
I MEAN, THERE'S OBVIOUSLY
A LOT MORE TO YOU
THAN PRATFALLS.

29:32.458 --> 29:35.583
WELL, JOEY...
YOU AIN'T SEEN
NOTHING YET.

29:37.208 --> 29:38.542
HEH HEH!

29:38.542 --> 29:40.333
OK.

29:43.375 --> 29:44.583
THERE HE IS!

29:44.583 --> 29:46.208
HEY THERE,
MR. MAN!

29:46.208 --> 29:48.125
WE BEEN LOOKING
FOR YOU.

29:48.125 --> 29:51.542
YOU CAME ALL
THE WAY DOWN HERE
LOOKING FOR ME?

29:51.542 --> 29:53.250
AREN'T I
A LUCKY GUY?

29:53.250 --> 29:56.125
YOU HAVE NO IDEA
JUST HOW LUCKY
YOU ARE.

29:56.125 --> 29:58.458
WHAT CAN I DO
FOR YOU, ABBY?

29:58.458 --> 30:00.083
YOU REMEMBERED
MY NAME.

30:00.083 --> 30:02.625
I NEVER FORGET
A PRETTY FACE.

30:02.625 --> 30:05.333
WELL, WE CAME DOWN
TO INVITE YOU OUT.

30:05.333 --> 30:08.125
I WAS THINKING
A NIGHT ON THE TOWN
IS IN ORDER.

30:08.125 --> 30:10.125
A LITTLE JOYRIDE
UP THE CAPE.

30:10.125 --> 30:12.291
THERE'S A WATERING HOLE
IN PORTSMOUTH

30:12.291 --> 30:14.458
WHERE WE COULD THROW BACK
A COUPLE OF DRINKS.

30:14.458 --> 30:17.000
I'M SURE YOU'VE HEARD
OF IT--WHITEY'S?

30:17.000 --> 30:19.125
IT'S ALL THE RAGE
WITH YOU LABORERS.

30:19.125 --> 30:22.083
"LABORER." IS THAT
MY DESIGNATED LABEL?

30:22.083 --> 30:24.083
NO. DON'T TAKE IT
THE WRONG WAY.

30:24.083 --> 30:26.583
I LOVE LABORERS.
THEY'RE SEXY,

30:26.583 --> 30:28.458
AND THEY KNOW WHAT
TO DO WITH THEIR HANDS.

30:28.458 --> 30:31.917
WELL, I'M GONNA
HAVE TO PASS.

30:31.917 --> 30:35.458
PASS? WHAT DO
YOU MEAN? WHY?

30:35.458 --> 30:38.000
I'LL TELL YOU WHY.

30:38.000 --> 30:40.458
I'M NOT INTERESTED
IN PLAYIN' SOME
BLUE-COLLAR PIN-UP

30:40.458 --> 30:42.834
FOR SOME OVERSEXED,
CONDESCENDING
TEENYBOPPER.

30:42.834 --> 30:44.166
EXCUSE ME?

30:45.500 --> 30:48.208
THANKS FOR COMING BY
AND SLUMMING IT.

30:48.208 --> 30:49.917
LET'S GO.

30:54.583 --> 30:56.500
VINCENT?

30:56.500 --> 31:00.208
HEY...ABBY'S GOT
A PARTICULAR WAY
WITH WORDS THAT--

31:00.208 --> 31:04.625
THAT SOMETIMES
THE STUFF SHE SAYS
COMES OUT WRONG,

31:04.625 --> 31:06.875
BUT SHE MEANS WELL.

31:06.875 --> 31:10.000
MOSTLY.

31:10.000 --> 31:12.667
ANYWAY, THE ONLY
REASON WE CAME ALL
THE WAY DOWN HERE

31:12.667 --> 31:15.959
IS BECAUSE SHE LIKES YOU,
SO GIVE HER A BREAK,
WOULD YOU?

31:20.542 --> 31:22.834
IT'S JEN, RIGHT?

31:22.834 --> 31:24.250
YEAH.

31:24.250 --> 31:26.542
I HAVE TO BE HONEST.

31:26.542 --> 31:28.083
I DON'T LIKE
YOUR FRIEND.

31:28.083 --> 31:29.834
I THINK SHE'S
A STUCK-UP PHONY

31:29.834 --> 31:32.375
WHO WOULDN'T KNOW
A REAL MAN FROM
A HOLE IN THE WALL,

31:32.375 --> 31:35.708
BUT YOU--
YOU'RE DIFFERENT.
I CAN TELL.

31:35.708 --> 31:39.208
AND IF YOU'D LIKE TO,
I'D BE HAPPY TO TAKE
YOU OUT SOMETIME.

31:39.208 --> 31:41.917
BUT DO ME A FAVOR--

31:41.917 --> 31:44.542
LEAVE ABBY AT HOME.

31:44.542 --> 31:46.625
Abby: JEN!

31:46.625 --> 31:48.166
JEN, COME ON!

31:50.834 --> 31:53.083
HEY, JEN...

31:53.083 --> 31:55.917
THANKS FOR
COMING BY.

32:03.417 --> 32:06.083
I'VE ACTUALLY
STARTED DOING SOME
DRAWINGS OF MY OWN.

32:06.083 --> 32:07.625
REALLY?
YEAH.

32:07.625 --> 32:10.250
THAT'S COOL.
I'D LOVE TO SEE
ANYTHING YOU'VE DONE.

32:10.250 --> 32:13.250
I MEAN, IF YOU WANT
TO SHOW IT TO ME.

32:13.250 --> 32:15.417
WELL, THERE'S NOT
MUCH TO SEE, REALLY.

32:15.417 --> 32:17.458
LAURA JUST
HAD US WORKING ON
A BOWL OF FRUIT,

32:17.458 --> 32:19.708
WHICH ISN'T
THE MOST INSPIRING
SUBJECT MATTER,

32:19.708 --> 32:20.875
TO SAY THE LEAST.

32:20.875 --> 32:22.458
SEE, YOU SHOULDN'T
BE WASTING YOUR TIME

32:22.458 --> 32:24.417
DRAWING THINGS YOU'RE
NOT PASSIONATE ABOUT.

32:24.417 --> 32:25.583
DRAW WHAT YOU LOVE.

32:25.583 --> 32:26.708
WHAT I LOVE?

32:26.708 --> 32:28.208
YEAH. THAT'S
WHAT ARTISTS DO.

32:28.208 --> 32:29.959
THEY GO TO A PLACE
INSIDE THEMSELVES,

32:29.959 --> 32:31.583
AND THEY FIND
WHAT INSPIRES THEM.

32:31.583 --> 32:34.417
YOU KNOW? DRAW WHAT'S
IMPORTANT TO YOU.

32:34.417 --> 32:35.750
WHAT ARE
YOU DOING HERE?

32:35.750 --> 32:37.542
I WAS LOOKING
ALL OVER FOR YOU.

32:37.542 --> 32:41.166
I WENT TO THE ICE HOUSE,
AND BESSIE SAID YOU
WERE HERE, SO...

32:41.166 --> 32:44.125
UH...JOEY,
I'M GONNA TAKE OFF.

32:44.125 --> 32:45.959
NO. WE CAN ALL
WALK BACK TOGETHER.

32:45.959 --> 32:47.667
NO, THAT'S COOL.
I'VE GOT SOME
ERRANDS TO RUN.

32:47.667 --> 32:49.083
BUT LISTEN,
I HAD A BLAST.

32:49.083 --> 32:51.125
ME, TOO.
THANK YOU
FOR COMING.

32:51.125 --> 32:52.458
SURE.

32:52.458 --> 32:55.417
SO, YOU WANT
TO CHECK OUT
THE EXHIBIT?

32:55.417 --> 32:57.208
I ALREADY DID, DAWSON.

32:57.208 --> 33:00.291
DO YOU WANT TO SHOW ME
THE PAINTINGS YOU LIKE?

33:00.291 --> 33:04.291
DAWSON, IT'S OK.
I KNOW THIS ISN'T
YOUR THING.

33:04.291 --> 33:06.458
YOU EARNED YOUR POINTS
JUST BY COMING.
THAT'S ENOUGH.

33:06.458 --> 33:07.625
NO...JOEY...
I WANNA BE HERE.

33:07.625 --> 33:09.959
I WANNA BE WITH YOU.

33:09.959 --> 33:12.792
JO, TALK TO ME.
WHAT'S WRONG?

33:12.792 --> 33:14.458
I KNOW I HURT
YOUR FEELINGS

33:14.458 --> 33:16.959
BY BEING TOO FLIP
ABOUT THIS ART THING,
AND I'M SORRY.

33:16.959 --> 33:18.959
IT WAS NEVER MY INTENTION,
BELIEVE ME.

33:18.959 --> 33:22.291
I'M JUST TRYING TO BE US--
DAWSON AND JOEY,

33:22.291 --> 33:25.417
WHO ANALYZE AND ARGUE
AND DEBATE AND DISAGREE.

33:25.417 --> 33:27.834
YOU'VE PUT ME IN MY PLACE
A THOUSAND TIMES
ABOUT SOME MOVIE.

33:27.834 --> 33:30.208
WHY CAN'T WE JUST
INTERCHANGE SUBJECTS?

33:30.208 --> 33:32.500
IT MIGHT ACTUALLY BE
A REFRESHING CHANGE.

33:32.500 --> 33:35.625
IT IS SO MUCH MORE
THAN THAT, DAWSON.

33:35.625 --> 33:38.166
THEN WHY ARE YOU CLOSING
YOURSELF OFF TO ME?
WHAT'S CHANGED?

33:38.166 --> 33:39.333
THAT'S THE POINT,
DAWSON!

33:39.333 --> 33:40.667
NOTHING'S CHANGED!

33:40.667 --> 33:43.000
YOU, ME--WE'RE
THE WAY WE'VE ALWAYS BEEN,

33:43.000 --> 33:45.041
AND I AM SO
TIRED OF IT!

34:03.166 --> 34:06.375
SO...I LOOKED UP
THIS PINTER GUY.

34:06.375 --> 34:10.375
HAROLD. PLAYWRIGHT.
THE KING OF SUBTEXT.

34:10.375 --> 34:13.208
YOU SAY ONE THING,
BUT YOU MEAN
ANOTHER.

34:13.208 --> 34:15.375
WE'RE BIG ON THAT
HERE IN CAPESIDE.

34:15.375 --> 34:17.375
HEH HEH. YES, I KNOW.

34:19.875 --> 34:22.208
DO YOU THINK IT'S
POSSIBLE FOR US
TO HAVE A MOMENT

34:22.208 --> 34:24.041
WITHOUT ALL
THE SUBTEXT?

34:24.041 --> 34:28.917
UH...I DON'T KNOW,
PACEY.

34:28.917 --> 34:33.041
WORDS HAVE ALWAYS GOTTEN US
INTO SO MUCH TROUBLE.

34:33.041 --> 34:36.041
YEAH. WELL...

34:36.041 --> 34:40.208
THAT'S NOT GONNA
HAPPEN THIS TIME.

34:40.208 --> 34:42.667
I BET YOU THOUGHT
I CAME OVER TO YOUR
HOUSE THE OTHER DAY

34:42.667 --> 34:44.708
TO POUR OUT
MY WOUNDED HEART
TO YOU,

34:44.708 --> 34:47.833
TO CONFESS JUST
HOW MUCH I MISS YOU,

34:47.833 --> 34:50.583
AND TO TELL YOU
THAT SEEING YOU
THE OTHER DAY

34:50.583 --> 34:52.083
BROUGHT BACK ALL
THE OLD FEELINGS.

34:53.750 --> 34:57.375
BUT, REALLY...
I'M FINE.

34:57.375 --> 34:59.208
YOU KNOW,
I KEEP THINKING

34:59.208 --> 35:02.750
THAT I SHOULDN'T BE
OVER THIS, BUT I AM.

35:02.750 --> 35:07.750
YOU KNOW, SEXUALLY,
WE WERE PRETTY GOOD
TOGETHER,

35:07.750 --> 35:10.250
BUT IN ALL
OTHER RESPECTS,

35:10.250 --> 35:12.125
WE WERE ON
2 DIFFERENT PLANETS,

35:12.125 --> 35:14.917
AND THAT'S WHAT
I CAME TO TELL YOU
THE OTHER DAY.

35:14.917 --> 35:17.583
I'M FINE.
I'VE GROWN UP.

35:17.583 --> 35:21.083
YOU HAVE. I SEE THAT.

35:21.083 --> 35:25.417
SO...HEH...

35:25.417 --> 35:28.834
I GUESS THIS IS IT--
THE LAST BIG GOOD-BYE.

35:34.625 --> 35:36.083
GOOD-BYE, PACEY.

36:17.542 --> 36:19.667
I THINK WE
COULD PROBABLY
BOTH BENEFIT

36:19.667 --> 36:22.708
FROM ONE OF THOSE
SILENT MOMENTS
RIGHT NOW.

36:22.708 --> 36:24.333
YES, I THINK SO.

36:27.000 --> 36:29.500
THIS PINTER GUY
WAS REALLY ONTO
SOMETHING.

36:29.500 --> 36:32.291
WHOO.

36:32.291 --> 36:34.333
YES, HE WAS.

36:38.333 --> 36:40.542
UM...TAMARA...

36:42.291 --> 36:45.333
YOU KNOW WHAT, PACEY?
UH...I HAVE A BUYER

36:45.333 --> 36:46.667
COMING HERE IN,
LIKE, AN HOUR,

36:46.667 --> 36:49.500
AND I REALLY NEED
TO CLEAN UP THIS PLACE.

36:51.041 --> 36:52.750
IS THAT
SUBTEXT AGAIN?

36:52.750 --> 36:54.333
NO.

36:55.834 --> 36:59.208
LISTEN...
I KNOW IT'S OVER.

36:59.208 --> 37:01.667
OK? IT HAS TO BE,
BUT I JUST--

37:01.667 --> 37:04.708
I NEED TO KNOW,
UM...

37:04.708 --> 37:08.208
AHEM...OH, GOD...

37:08.208 --> 37:12.041
DO YOU...MISS, UH...

37:14.667 --> 37:16.750
TEACHING?

37:20.583 --> 37:22.291
YES.

37:25.875 --> 37:28.500
VERY MUCH.

37:28.500 --> 37:31.208
GOOD.

37:31.208 --> 37:33.542
BECAUSE I MISS
YOUR TEACHING.

37:36.583 --> 37:39.083
VERY MUCH.

38:03.917 --> 38:05.917
ABBY, I LIKE YOUR DRESS.

38:05.917 --> 38:07.542
DID I TELL YOU THAT?

38:07.542 --> 38:10.208
ONLY ABOUT 300 TIMES.

38:10.208 --> 38:12.917
ALL RIGHT, I GIVE UP.
WHAT DID I DO?

38:12.917 --> 38:14.667
WHY ARE YOU PUNISHING ME?

38:14.667 --> 38:17.792
I LIKED THAT GUY.
WE WENT DOWN THERE
FOR ME...

38:17.792 --> 38:20.125
AND YOU JUST STOLE HIM
RIGHT OUT FROM UNDER ME.

38:20.125 --> 38:22.250
I SAW THE LOOKS
YOU WERE GIVING HIM,

38:22.250 --> 38:24.750
BATTING YOUR EYELASHES
AT HIM WITH THE MASCARA
I BOUGHT YOU.

38:24.750 --> 38:27.083
ABBY, THAT'S NOT TRUE.
I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.

38:27.083 --> 38:29.291
AND AFTER EVERYTHING
I'VE DONE FOR YOU.

38:29.291 --> 38:32.959
AND, I MEAN,
I LIKE ONE GUY--
JUST ONE GUY--

38:32.959 --> 38:34.708
AND YOU
CAN'T STEP OUT
OF THE SPOTLIGHT

38:34.708 --> 38:36.250
LONG ENOUGH
FOR ME TO GET HIM.

38:36.250 --> 38:38.750
LOOK, YOU CAN HAVE HIM,
OK? I DON'T WANT HIM.

38:38.750 --> 38:41.000
YOU'RE MY FRIEND.
THAT'S WHAT'S
IMPORTANT TO ME.

38:41.000 --> 38:43.625
SCREW THE CRAP.
FRIENDS DON'T COMPETE
OVER THE SAME GUY.

38:43.625 --> 38:46.291
DON'T BLAME ME
JUST BECAUSE YOU
GOT REJECTED.

38:46.291 --> 38:47.834
I DIDN'T GET REJECTED.

38:47.834 --> 38:50.208
THAT'S YOUR SPECIALTY,
NOT MINE.

39:03.166 --> 39:04.542
CAN WE TALK?

39:06.458 --> 39:08.542
YEAH, IF YOU EXPLAIN
WHAT'S GOING ON.

39:10.375 --> 39:12.000
YOU'RE SCARING ME, JOEY,

39:12.000 --> 39:15.041
AND I'M AFRAID IF I SAY ANYTHING
IT'S GONNA LEAD TO A FIGHT.

39:15.041 --> 39:18.667
DAWSON, LOOK,
I'VE BEEN THINKING

39:18.667 --> 39:21.959
OF HOW TO MAKE YOU UNDERSTAND
MY BEHAVIOR LATELY.

39:21.959 --> 39:23.792
YOU KNOW, WHY I'VE
BEEN PUSHING YOU AWAY,

39:23.792 --> 39:27.792
BUT THEN I REALIZED THAT
I DON'T EVEN KNOW, DAWSON.

39:27.792 --> 39:31.417
ALL I KNOW IS
THAT YOU ARE VERY
IMPORTANT TO ME,

39:31.417 --> 39:35.041
AND THIS ART THING--
WHETHER IT BE A HOBBY
OR MY LIFE'S PASSION--

39:35.041 --> 39:36.959
IS IMPORTANT TO ME, TOO.

39:36.959 --> 39:39.333
IT IS THE FIRST THING
OTHER THAN YOU

39:39.333 --> 39:41.208
THAT'S BEEN IMPORTANT
TO ME IN A LONG TIME.

39:41.208 --> 39:43.583
JOEY, THAT'S GREAT.

39:43.583 --> 39:47.875
I'M GLAD YOU HAVE
THAT. I REALLY AM.

39:47.875 --> 39:51.000
I JUST DON'T WANNA
LOSE WHAT'S GREAT
ABOUT US.

39:54.500 --> 39:56.875
DAWSON...

39:56.875 --> 39:59.250
YOU'VE BEEN
EVERYTHING TO ME...

39:59.250 --> 40:01.834
AND I HAVE BEEN
YOUR SIDEKICK,
YOUR CONFIDANT,

40:01.834 --> 40:03.542
YOUR OTHER HALF
FOR SO LONG,

40:03.542 --> 40:05.667
AND THAT'S HOW OUR
RELATIONSHIP WORKS.

40:05.667 --> 40:09.750
AND IT'S A NICE PLACE
FOR YOU, BUT FOR ME,
IT'S SCARY

40:09.750 --> 40:12.875
BECAUSE I REALIZED
THAT, ASIDE FROM YOU,
I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING.

40:12.875 --> 40:15.875
MY ENTIRE LIFE
IS ATTACHED TO YOU,
DAWSON.

40:15.875 --> 40:18.875
I WAS WORKING ON
THESE SKETCHES,

40:18.875 --> 40:23.917
AND SOMEBODY TOLD
ME TO DRAW WHAT'S
IMPORTANT TO ME...

40:23.917 --> 40:26.875
WHAT INSPIRES ME,
WHAT I LOVE...

40:32.291 --> 40:35.500
AND THIS IS THE ONLY THING
I COULD THINK OF.

40:41.250 --> 40:42.917
JOEY...

40:42.917 --> 40:44.750
LOOK--AND
THAT'S NOT OK

40:44.750 --> 40:45.750
WITH ME, DAWSON.

40:45.750 --> 40:47.250
I CARE ABOUT YOU
SO MUCH,

40:47.250 --> 40:49.375
BUT IF I EVER LOST
YOU, I WOULD BE
STANDING HERE,

40:49.375 --> 40:51.458
TOTALLY VOID
OF ANYTHING ELSE
IN MY LIFE.

40:51.458 --> 40:54.125
I LIVE IN TOTAL FEAR
OF DOING NOTHING,
OF GOING NOWHERE,

40:54.125 --> 40:56.208
AND THAT IS WHY
I SHUT YOU OUT.

40:56.208 --> 40:59.250
BECAUSE IF I CAN'T HAVE
SOMETHING TO HOLD ONTO
INDEPENDENTLY FROM YOU,

40:59.250 --> 41:00.583
THEN I DON'T HAVE
ANYTHING AT ALL.

41:00.583 --> 41:03.583
FIRST OF ALL,
I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

41:03.583 --> 41:06.750
SECONDLY, I JUST WANT
YOU TO BE HAPPY.

41:06.750 --> 41:09.792
NOW, WHATEVER THAT MEANS,
I'LL PROVIDE IT

41:09.792 --> 41:12.125
OR SUPPORT IT OR BE
COMPLETELY UNINVOLVED
WITH IT.

41:12.125 --> 41:15.125
I MEAN, WHATEVER IT TAKES.

41:16.583 --> 41:18.583
I JUST WANT US
TO STOP FIGHTING.

41:18.583 --> 41:20.458
DAWSON, I WASN'T
FIGHTING WITH YOU.

41:20.458 --> 41:23.000
I WAS FIGHTING
WITH MYSELF.

41:23.000 --> 41:25.625
PART OF ME WANTED
TO SEND YOU OFF
FROM ME,

41:25.625 --> 41:29.208
AND THE OTHER PART
WANTED TO HOLD YOU
SO TIGHT.

41:33.125 --> 41:34.625
WELL, WHICH PART
OF YOU WON?

41:40.750 --> 41:42.333
JO?

41:43.834 --> 41:47.208
DAWSON...

41:47.208 --> 41:51.333
I DON'T MEAN TO
SOUND LIKE A BLOB
OF PAINT, BUT...

41:51.333 --> 41:53.166
CAN WE JUST LET
THIS ONE THING

41:53.166 --> 41:55.375
REMAIN UNRESOLVED
FOR NOW?

42:28.041 --> 42:29.417
[KNOCK KNOCK]

42:38.500 --> 42:40.291
HOW'S THE BURGER HERE?

42:43.917 --> 42:45.583
DAWSON TOLD YOU,
DIDN'T HE?

42:45.583 --> 42:47.542
DON'T PLAY DUMB.

42:47.542 --> 42:50.542
WHEN DUMB PEOPLE
PLAY DUMB, IT'S
VERY DISCONCERTING.

42:50.542 --> 42:52.417
DAWSON TOLD YOU
WHAT I TOLD HIM,

42:52.417 --> 42:55.041
AND THAT'S WHY
YOU'RE ACTING
SO WEIRD.

42:55.041 --> 42:57.542
JUST ADMIT IT.

42:57.542 --> 43:00.333
I REALLY HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

43:00.333 --> 43:03.208
YES, IT'S TRUE.
I HAD A BRIEF FLASH

43:03.208 --> 43:05.750
OF MAYBE FEELING
LIKE I DIDN'T,
POSSIBLY, HATE YOU.

43:05.750 --> 43:07.417
HMM, BUT IT
WILL PASS,

43:07.417 --> 43:10.250
SO THERE'S NO NEED
TO GET A BIG HEAD
OR ANYTHING.

43:10.250 --> 43:11.542
SO, YOU THINK
IT'LL PASS?

43:11.542 --> 43:14.250
IT MAY PASS.
IT MOST LIKELY
WILL PASS.

43:14.250 --> 43:16.875
UNLESS...NO. IT WILL
DEFINITELY PASS.

43:16.875 --> 43:19.041
IN FACT, I THINK
IT JUST DID.

43:19.041 --> 43:21.250
YEP, HEH.
THERE IT WENT.
IT'S GONE.

43:22.542 --> 43:25.917
YOU LIKE ME.
YOU REALLY LIKE ME.

43:25.917 --> 43:28.959
PACEY, PLEASE,
STOP TORTURING ME.

43:28.959 --> 43:30.875
I WANT TO,
BUT I CAN'T.

43:30.875 --> 43:32.291
THERE'S JUST SOMETHING
ABOUT YOU, McPHEE.

43:32.291 --> 43:34.333
YOU BRING OUT
THE SADIST IN ME.

43:37.417 --> 43:39.792
DON'T YOU KNOW
THAT WOMAN?

43:44.959 --> 43:47.500
I DID.

43:49.458 --> 43:51.834
BUT NOT ANYMORE.

43:57.083 --> 43:59.083
SO, ANYWAY...
