00:12.049 --> 00:13.095
Will you calm the...

00:13.764 --> 00:16.585
Oslo knows nothing, neither does she.

00:16.674 --> 00:19.757
Your research was sponsored
by Schenthal Biotech.

00:19.792 --> 00:21.192
It's a pharmaceutical company.

00:21.258 --> 00:25.633
There was some kind of scandal
involving healthy human beings.

00:27.846 --> 00:30.450
You shouldn't believe everything you read.

00:30.485 --> 00:31.765
Natalie?!

00:31.867 --> 00:34.869
Communes with the spirits. Heals the sick.

00:34.932 --> 00:35.693
Sometimes.

00:35.736 --> 00:37.976
We can stop him before it's too late.

02:23.001 --> 02:25.210
- Hey.
- Hi.

02:26.281 --> 02:28.687
I need to find Governor Odegard.

02:31.241 --> 02:33.900
Hildur Odegard isn't the Governor anymore.

02:33.962 --> 02:36.160
I-I still need to find her.

02:36.195 --> 02:39.055
Yeah. She lives in the Blue Fox now.

02:39.090 --> 02:41.011
Her and Eric have split up.

02:41.835 --> 02:42.946
Thanks.

02:43.523 --> 02:45.967
Or maybe it's just a trial
separation of some sort.

02:46.002 --> 02:51.762
And everything will work out
after a break. Hard to tell.

03:20.572 --> 03:21.778
He's dead.

03:27.102 --> 03:28.244
Muscimol.

03:29.066 --> 03:33.462
Five or six hours. Heart failure,
I think. All the indications.

03:34.909 --> 03:38.708
This is shamanistic ritual.

03:38.780 --> 03:42.363
I think the killer is a shaman,
Eric, and I think Tavrani was

03:42.411 --> 03:46.231
involved in shamanism, too. The
killer needs parts from human

03:46.266 --> 03:49.635
bodies... Hindemith,
Bianca, the graves. If we can

03:49.670 --> 03:50.894
understand what he's thinking...

03:50.929 --> 03:53.777
Stop, Petra. This is Voodoo.

03:53.819 --> 03:57.012
- Madness, delusional fucking fairytales.
- She's right.

03:57.071 --> 03:59.352
If we can understand what he's thinking...

03:59.387 --> 04:01.499
Get inside his way of thinking...

04:01.534 --> 04:02.671
His world view...

04:02.738 --> 04:05.411
I don't even know what
my own wife is thinking!

04:14.460 --> 04:20.103
It's not snow-blindness.
Pupil reactions are normal.

04:20.165 --> 04:24.221
No inflammation in the eye tissues.

04:25.580 --> 04:29.718
No engorgement or retinal
ischemia. Ocular pressure is normal.

04:29.760 --> 04:34.599
The OCT and MRI scans show
up no abnormalities. None.

04:34.740 --> 04:40.488
What if... what if this whole
thing is effectively psychological?

04:42.632 --> 04:45.955
You mean my eyes can see, but
my brain doesn't want to look at

04:46.018 --> 04:47.135
what my eyes are showing it?

04:47.170 --> 04:50.159
I'm talking about an intense
neurological event prompted

04:50.194 --> 04:54.233
by stress and exhaustion
resulting in a temporary blindness.

04:54.420 --> 04:57.000
So I'm not... I'm not
blind, I'm just mental.

04:57.054 --> 05:00.037
A psychological reaction
to the wasp trauma.

05:00.072 --> 05:03.071
Wha-wha-what about if it's a
physiological reaction to the

05:03.106 --> 05:04.305
wasp trauma?

05:04.386 --> 05:07.907
Well, then Doctor Adebimpe would have
found a physiological explanation...

05:07.969 --> 05:10.192
With his little
ophthalmoscope and his torch?

05:10.262 --> 05:13.216
Plus the OCT and MRI scanners.

05:14.100 --> 05:18.686
The parasite that attacked me
was subtle, malicious, insidious

05:18.776 --> 05:23.483
and... and... a fuck of a lot smarter
than anyone in this room, so...

06:13.620 --> 06:14.822
Found anyone?

06:15.780 --> 06:17.108
What?

06:17.166 --> 06:19.985
Suspect. Made an arrest?

06:20.020 --> 06:23.698
No, the investigation is,
err... is... it's ongoing...

06:36.620 --> 06:41.905
Coffee? Irish maybe?

06:53.950 --> 07:00.455
This is from me, Dan. From all of us.

07:03.494 --> 07:04.598
Drink up.

07:06.082 --> 07:07.416
What do you want, Eric?

07:07.474 --> 07:11.477
Finish the job you started.
Drinking yourself to death.

07:11.798 --> 07:14.629
You don't have any idea
what you're dealing with.

07:15.203 --> 07:17.650
I'm dealing with an alcoholic.

07:19.649 --> 07:24.208
Governor Munk says you broke into
Doctor Khatri's home and threatened her.

07:24.283 --> 07:25.593
You don't know what you're doing.

07:25.646 --> 07:29.596
If you weren't threatening her,
then you're mentally unstable.

07:30.409 --> 07:32.810
One or the other. Which is it to be?

07:32.855 --> 07:34.703
Arrested or sectioned?

07:35.260 --> 07:39.688
Eric... you're not a fucking sheriff.

07:43.745 --> 07:44.245
Thank you.

07:44.280 --> 07:50.668
Mister Mankyo, my friend,
I am so, very, very sorry.

07:52.180 --> 07:54.339
Bianca was a beautiful soul.

07:54.340 --> 07:58.320
A lovely young woman, and
my heart goes out to you.

07:59.780 --> 08:02.669
Mister Mankyo has asked
me to lead the room.

08:03.140 --> 08:04.539
To lead...?

08:04.540 --> 08:07.396
Bianca was in my choir, Mrs. Odegard.

08:18.340 --> 08:19.463
Hey...

08:22.100 --> 08:23.352
You okay?

08:23.465 --> 08:25.503
Oh, this coffee's got whiskey in it.

08:26.127 --> 08:29.498
No... this whiskey's got coffee in it.

08:32.075 --> 08:36.067
Munk said on the phone that
they're not paying him enough money.

08:39.025 --> 08:42.666
He said he'd made Eric sheriff
because he could control him.

08:42.701 --> 08:43.900
Everyone, please?

08:49.980 --> 08:54.499
Bianca Mankyo has been taken from us.

08:54.500 --> 08:58.399
We have lost a beautiful
daughter, a dear friend and a very

08:58.441 --> 08:59.924
talented student.

09:02.796 --> 09:07.348
Her father has asked that instead
of words, we say farewell to

09:07.415 --> 09:09.333
Bianca with music.

09:10.636 --> 09:14.382
This is a piece Bianca
loved, the whole choir loved.

09:15.668 --> 09:17.071
So this is for her...

09:22.948 --> 09:28.140
♪ Little Lamb who made thee... ♪

09:29.045 --> 09:32.638
♪ Dost thou know who made thee. ♪

09:32.701 --> 09:35.100
Someone has to fix this.

09:35.151 --> 09:38.225
Make sure all these people are
safe again. That's all that matters.

09:38.274 --> 09:39.863
You won't find him.

09:39.933 --> 09:44.631
Listen to me very carefully because
what I'm telling you is important.

09:46.042 --> 09:52.917
You shot Elena. You left her
in that state. In that bed.

09:53.198 --> 09:57.079
Persistent, vegetative state. You!

09:58.619 --> 09:59.999
And then you ran away!

10:13.722 --> 10:21.650
♪ ...His name. Little
lamb, God bless thee! ♪

10:21.710 --> 10:26.474
This town does not care about you anymore.

10:38.556 --> 10:41.165
It's him. That's him!

10:54.362 --> 10:55.522
MOVE YOUR HEAD!!!

11:05.597 --> 11:06.726
ERIC!!!

11:08.924 --> 11:11.650
Everybody! Stay inside!

11:12.001 --> 11:14.142
- Dad!
- Come on!

11:23.517 --> 11:26.877
Hong. Not with the knife. Hong!

11:32.780 --> 11:33.813
All right?

11:34.616 --> 11:36.510
It's all right.

11:49.100 --> 11:51.106
It's his tongue. Isn't it?

11:51.203 --> 11:53.228
It's him. He took Tavrani's tongue.

12:29.076 --> 12:30.873
- Go that way!
- Alright.

13:02.771 --> 13:04.088
Eric!

13:16.887 --> 13:18.019
Eric!

13:18.086 --> 13:19.907
Who shot? Where is Eric?!

13:19.980 --> 13:22.719
Over there. He shot him.

13:50.156 --> 13:54.409
POLICE! COME OUT! HEAR ME?!

13:54.460 --> 13:56.229
COME OUTSIDE NOW!

13:56.722 --> 13:58.271
COME OUTSIDE!

14:39.083 --> 14:43.048
There's no-one. Just that dog.

14:44.679 --> 14:46.367
I didn't see a dog.

14:47.180 --> 14:48.620
There was a dog.

14:54.820 --> 14:56.072
What is it?

14:57.290 --> 15:01.129
Eric? Eric?

15:01.195 --> 15:02.515
What is it?

15:48.245 --> 15:49.357
You can...

15:56.155 --> 15:58.029
You can confirm...?

15:59.593 --> 16:02.373
Bianca Mankyo. Yes, that's her.

16:09.075 --> 16:10.554
You had him.

16:10.611 --> 16:14.032
He taunted you and then
you let him get away.

16:15.786 --> 16:17.234
I shot and wounded him.

16:17.235 --> 16:18.823
Is that a fact?

16:18.888 --> 16:23.037
And then he turned into, err, a big
dog and ran off into the blizzard.

16:23.099 --> 16:24.265
I didn't say...

16:24.327 --> 16:27.342
That's exactly what the
other men are saying, Eric.

16:27.377 --> 16:28.686
Perhaps...

16:28.741 --> 16:32.639
Someone killed Bianca in the
muscimol den and put her body

16:32.689 --> 16:35.888
where we found Hindemith's
body, because they wanted us to

16:35.923 --> 16:38.266
think it was the same
killer when it wasn't.

16:38.305 --> 16:40.807
So we could be looking at two
killers, and one is a copy cat...

16:40.877 --> 16:46.242
There are no such things as Copy
Cat Killers in the real world!

16:46.277 --> 16:47.803
They're made up!

16:51.486 --> 16:56.754
I want this killer found.
You understand?! The killer!

16:56.858 --> 17:01.041
The one killer in Fortitude!

17:04.256 --> 17:05.818
Find him!

17:53.569 --> 17:55.863
Michael, it's me. There's
a package in my room.

17:55.921 --> 17:58.120
I think it's from Dmitri Podnikov.

17:58.370 --> 17:59.977
Documents and film.

18:01.575 --> 18:08.614
Um... sixteen millimetre
I think. Okay, see you then.

18:10.235 --> 18:12.418
What do you know about Doctor Khatri?

18:13.699 --> 18:14.841
Dan!

18:15.961 --> 18:17.172
Hildur.

18:20.235 --> 18:22.197
Wh, why do you ask me that?

18:30.195 --> 18:32.599
I think she's been doing bad.

18:33.915 --> 18:35.954
Doing... bad?

18:35.955 --> 18:37.387
To Elena.

18:38.955 --> 18:43.589
I don't understand what you mean.
Elena's condition is intractable.

18:43.624 --> 18:45.255
Who SAYS?!

18:49.595 --> 18:56.480
Everyone in the specialist team
who examined her. Listen to me, Dan.

18:56.515 --> 18:58.252
Khatri is in a terrible position.

18:58.302 --> 19:02.661
She can't simply let Elena
die, that's not a possibility.

19:03.568 --> 19:08.153
As long as there is life there,
Khatri has to treasure that life.

19:08.200 --> 19:09.372
We all do.

19:11.994 --> 19:13.634
You have to let her go.

19:28.915 --> 19:30.210
Shut the door.

19:41.555 --> 19:45.834
You fucking idiot.

19:45.835 --> 19:48.332
- Careful.
- They have found her head.

19:49.339 --> 19:54.286
- Not possible.
- I fucking saw it. In a yellow bag.

19:57.555 --> 19:59.082
It's not possible.

20:00.315 --> 20:02.114
Where the fuck did you leave it?

20:02.115 --> 20:05.794
- Down a deep hole.
- Well, they have it.

20:05.864 --> 20:06.720
How?

20:06.787 --> 20:10.706
Some lunatic in an anorak led them to it.

20:10.755 --> 20:11.740
Where?

20:11.826 --> 20:17.200
Some fucking... shed.
Hanging from the rafters.

20:17.292 --> 20:20.274
A spotlight illuminating it.

20:20.355 --> 20:23.944
- Neon arrows... Big flashing sign...
- Who is he?

20:24.022 --> 20:26.923
The mad fucker who cut
the other guy's head off.

20:27.892 --> 20:29.201
Jesus.

20:32.955 --> 20:38.267
I didn't sign up for this bloodbath.

20:42.777 --> 20:46.755
Right. This is what has got to happen,
this is what you're going to do.

20:47.995 --> 20:49.676
- I need you to...
- Fatty.

20:49.731 --> 20:51.124
- What?
- Shut up.

20:51.362 --> 20:54.482
Di... Did you just call me fatty?

20:59.827 --> 21:08.029
You're an amateur. Stay
in your room tonight.

21:08.107 --> 21:14.000
Drink your vodka and in the
morning, it'll all be fixed.

21:18.860 --> 21:22.580
This simply must hurt like the very devil.

21:27.755 --> 21:29.914
Yes, it does.

21:29.915 --> 21:32.647
But... I keep the pain inside...

21:32.717 --> 21:34.714
for when it's needed.

21:34.786 --> 21:36.994
Needed?

21:36.995 --> 21:38.744
Err, what I have to do in this place...

21:38.779 --> 21:43.792
is going to take... an agony of pain.

21:48.915 --> 21:50.750
Why did they shoot you?

21:52.445 --> 21:54.485
The little girl who was killed...

21:58.271 --> 22:01.222
Another man killed her.

22:01.368 --> 22:04.327
- You know who murdered Bianca?
- I will.

22:08.225 --> 22:09.926
I will know him.

22:12.138 --> 22:13.598
Why are you here?

22:16.355 --> 22:19.854
There's a demon.

22:20.564 --> 22:21.694
A demon?

22:21.870 --> 22:25.034
It's been on earth before.

22:25.035 --> 22:30.939
My grandfather knew him
then and now, now it's me.

22:32.795 --> 22:34.714
You saw the blood aurora?

22:35.098 --> 22:37.780
The demon brings it.

22:37.875 --> 22:40.835
So that he can find the
souls he's looking for.

22:47.049 --> 22:50.718
No. You should stay here tonight.
If you move, you could bleed.

22:52.035 --> 22:54.613
Yes. Yes.

22:54.648 --> 23:01.850
Vladek. Cou, cou, could,
could you you help me?

23:03.155 --> 23:09.401
Make me whole again? Stop
this thing in me? Hmm?

23:10.560 --> 23:12.027
This demon.

23:13.235 --> 23:14.507
Could you?

23:39.905 --> 23:44.957
- What is this, a post-mortem?
- Don't know...

23:49.777 --> 23:52.966
He's been opened up before.
Right down the middle.

23:53.001 --> 23:55.195
It's-It's, err... Pretty slapdash.

23:55.230 --> 24:03.409
There was a disaster.
1942. Near Vukobejina.

24:04.213 --> 24:05.276
Hmm.

24:06.035 --> 24:11.549
A weather station. A Sami settlement.

24:13.235 --> 24:15.136
Everyone was killed.

24:16.715 --> 24:18.210
Except him I think.

24:19.789 --> 24:21.427
What killed them?

24:22.555 --> 24:23.984
He did.

24:28.875 --> 24:29.790
Anything else?

24:29.848 --> 24:34.175
Something about regeneration.

24:40.656 --> 24:45.274
What the fuck! He's not dead!

24:45.361 --> 24:46.660
Oh, my God.

25:10.915 --> 25:13.102
Tissue regeneration.

25:15.035 --> 25:16.674
What?

25:16.675 --> 25:21.924
They hurt him and he healed.
The damage was reversed.

25:23.355 --> 25:27.035
They think they, they
discovered something...

25:29.810 --> 25:32.036
Discovered what? What?

25:35.339 --> 25:40.609
Tissue regeneration. Is that real?

25:41.306 --> 25:44.409
They could reverse tissue damage?

25:50.076 --> 25:52.340
- Vincent was attacked by the wasps...
- Yes.

25:52.400 --> 25:55.307
He was stung upwards of two hundred stings.

25:55.385 --> 25:57.594
Yes. He went into anaphylaxis.
Windpipe closed up.

25:57.629 --> 25:59.308
I had to perform a tracheotomy on him.

25:59.355 --> 26:00.335
You saved his life.

26:00.370 --> 26:04.139
Also... I blew him up in a gas explosion.

26:04.881 --> 26:06.234
There were no eggs laid, no larvae?

26:06.300 --> 26:08.482
- No.
- Nothing that matched Elena's experience

26:08.553 --> 26:09.672
or the others who all died?

26:09.729 --> 26:11.289
He was stung. Just stung.

26:12.468 --> 26:15.259
I think you have to consider
sending Vincent away.

26:16.915 --> 26:19.060
- Away where?
- To a less challenging environment.

26:19.121 --> 26:21.728
You've ruled out parasites
and pathogens. We're familiar

26:21.763 --> 26:23.343
- enough with conversion disorder.
- No...

26:23.378 --> 26:25.154
Hysterical blindness.

26:25.495 --> 26:27.426
Some people aren't cut out
for such challenging work

26:27.492 --> 26:29.344
in dangerous circumstances.

26:30.352 --> 26:33.301
He almost died saving the rest of us.

26:33.336 --> 26:36.635
And maybe that heroism was
not truly in his character.

26:37.289 --> 26:39.086
Now he pays the cost.

26:50.755 --> 26:51.841
Mum...

26:53.795 --> 26:54.946
You okay?

26:56.465 --> 26:58.425
Wasn't expecting you home...

27:00.362 --> 27:02.234
Oh, I'm so fucked.

27:02.305 --> 27:03.625
Yeah... You look it.

27:11.515 --> 27:13.601
Oh. We nearly had him.

27:14.877 --> 27:19.175
Eric thinks he shot him, but
we're not sure. He got away.

27:19.224 --> 27:20.434
That's good.

27:25.348 --> 27:26.787
What are you cooking?

27:27.234 --> 27:28.651
Luttefische.

27:30.140 --> 27:33.580
Really? What are you making that stuff for?

27:33.643 --> 27:36.362
Nobody in their right minds
eats Luttefische these days.

27:49.375 --> 27:50.349
Mum?

27:53.081 --> 27:54.447
Who's been bleeding?

27:57.084 --> 28:02.440
Rune... Rune must've put
it... Yeah, he must've...

28:06.435 --> 28:07.755
Mum, who's this for?

28:08.793 --> 28:10.868
I just thought I'd make some...

28:28.018 --> 28:29.294
Ingrid!

28:33.526 --> 28:35.277
- Ingrid!
- SHOW YOURSELF!

28:35.312 --> 28:37.783
POLICE! NOW!

28:39.530 --> 28:44.102
Ingrid! Stop this. Stop this, please.

28:45.515 --> 28:49.755
Was he here? Mum! Tell me!

28:49.817 --> 28:50.946
Was he hiding here?

28:51.028 --> 28:54.626
Look at you. The state
of you. You're exhausted.

28:54.661 --> 28:59.351
Co, Come inside with me, please.
Hmm? The luttefische, an old recipe.

28:59.386 --> 29:00.639
I remembered it.

29:04.684 --> 29:07.180
- Promise me?
- I'd promise you anything, child,

29:07.215 --> 29:09.145
anything. The whole world.

29:21.781 --> 29:24.000
I'm sorry.

29:24.055 --> 29:28.180
It's okay. They make you
see things a young woman...

29:28.238 --> 29:29.769
should never...

29:32.598 --> 29:33.801
Dislocate...

29:33.887 --> 29:35.501
Yeah, yep. Okay.

29:36.815 --> 29:41.014
So the exact... the exact
date that I can tell you...

29:41.111 --> 29:42.832
is the 2nd of...

29:42.992 --> 29:44.098
January.

30:10.898 --> 30:11.858
Absolutely!

30:19.355 --> 30:20.701
What do you do...?

30:22.035 --> 30:23.874
Give me your security pass.

30:24.088 --> 30:24.914
What?

30:24.980 --> 30:26.274
For your lab.

30:26.275 --> 30:27.235
What?!

30:29.671 --> 30:32.885
This explodes in the air and
lights up the sky with shards of

30:32.920 --> 30:34.498
incandescent phosphorus.

30:34.554 --> 30:37.914
You're a scientist. You
know what phosphorus does.

30:39.123 --> 30:42.422
Yes. Imagine it exploded inside a car.

30:47.094 --> 30:49.673
I haven't done anything
to deserve such a thing.

30:51.407 --> 30:52.674
Is that what you tell yourself?

30:52.731 --> 30:54.061
I don't know what you mean.

30:54.955 --> 30:58.885
The girl you have in that
glass box. Elena Ledesma.

31:00.450 --> 31:02.027
I killed a man for her.

31:05.275 --> 31:07.250
No. Please.

31:08.952 --> 31:11.772
I find my sense of smell's heightened.

31:12.160 --> 31:19.452
Of course right now, in this car,
the overwhelming smell is fear.

31:20.165 --> 31:21.858
Does that surprise you?

31:22.995 --> 31:26.743
I find I can tell the difference
between pure fear, and fear

31:26.778 --> 31:28.454
tainted with guilt.

31:28.548 --> 31:30.711
And the last thing I expected...

31:32.025 --> 31:34.354
There is no smell of guilt.

31:39.155 --> 31:43.554
I was in a place called
Aruwamba. Ebola outbreak.

31:43.555 --> 31:47.159
People liquefied from the inside.
We collected their body fluids.

31:47.194 --> 31:49.381
Mopped up their remains and examined them.

31:51.479 --> 31:55.656
I felt no guilt or shame amongst
all that death because out of it,

31:55.750 --> 31:58.594
our work brought hope and possibility.

31:58.595 --> 32:04.416
I stank of vomit and blood and
human excrement every night.

32:04.995 --> 32:06.455
But never guilt.

32:17.034 --> 32:19.292
I have to say goodbye to Elena.

32:22.033 --> 32:23.223
Give me that.

32:54.720 --> 32:56.639
I told you a big lie, Vincent.

32:58.305 --> 33:00.970
I told you they were all dead.
There were none left alive.

33:02.937 --> 33:04.344
I can hear them.

33:04.415 --> 33:05.816
You can see them.

33:07.792 --> 33:08.832
No.

33:08.912 --> 33:12.283
Yes. We needed to bring
them back to study them.

33:16.090 --> 33:16.932
We burned them all.

33:17.006 --> 33:20.086
I have a scientific
responsibility. An obligation.

33:20.149 --> 33:22.274
- You know that.
- Not to me?

33:24.912 --> 33:26.604
I shouldn't have lied to you.

33:28.497 --> 33:31.883
You were in so much trouble and
when we brought the roof down on

33:31.918 --> 33:34.005
that glacier... lying to you seemed right.

33:34.066 --> 33:39.120
And you think I'm lying
to you now. About my eyes.

33:42.240 --> 33:43.777
No.

33:43.816 --> 33:45.176
One of us is.

33:49.525 --> 33:51.633
Are you lying when you say you love me?

33:54.445 --> 33:57.604
Is this what it looks like... Your love?

36:21.163 --> 36:26.073
Goodbye... my love.

36:54.244 --> 36:55.550
Ingrid, Petra!

36:59.451 --> 37:04.810
Stock control in the airport
souvenir shop says this bag

37:04.877 --> 37:08.164
was sold by a franchise branch in Berlin.

37:08.226 --> 37:11.204
Fourteenth February, 10:31 a.m.

37:11.306 --> 37:12.946
Airport security video.

37:13.845 --> 37:18.648
February fourteenth... Berlin
flight connects at Oslo, 16:25.

37:18.683 --> 37:20.749
Oslo flight arrives in Fortitude...

37:23.206 --> 37:24.559
This is disembarking...

37:24.637 --> 37:31.050
Catches everyone...
arrivals, misses luggage.

37:31.113 --> 37:32.228
Yellow holdall.

37:32.297 --> 37:33.456
That's our man.

37:38.444 --> 37:39.622
The barman.

37:44.080 --> 37:49.164
♪ Little Lamb who made thee ♪

37:49.165 --> 37:56.764
♪ Dost thou know who made thee. ♪

39:11.226 --> 39:13.204
Aim for the centre of the body.

39:13.255 --> 39:15.663
Not a limb and not the
head or any other part of...

39:15.723 --> 39:18.202
I know. Dan made us practice this, Eric.

39:18.351 --> 39:21.026
Listen to me. This man
killed Bianca Mankyo.

39:21.106 --> 39:23.725
He'll kill to avoid arrest, don't doubt it.

39:25.445 --> 39:28.681
If we have any reason at all to
fear for our safety, we shoot him.

39:28.716 --> 39:29.879
Okay.

39:33.210 --> 39:35.478
- We shoot the fucker in the face.
- I know.

43:43.338 --> 43:44.895
- POLICE!
- SHOW YOURSELF!

43:46.912 --> 43:48.214
TOMAK, POLICE!

44:54.701 --> 44:55.886
You woke me up.

45:17.895 --> 45:19.216
- _
- You can't trust anyone here.

45:19.251 --> 45:20.571
Can I trust you, Dan?

45:23.615 --> 45:25.494
- _
- Erling Munk is corrupt.

45:25.567 --> 45:27.173
Conspiracy theory... bullshit!

45:27.233 --> 45:31.547
Someone is collecting body parts because
they think there is a monster here.

45:31.614 --> 45:32.771
A monster.
