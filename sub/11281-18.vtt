EVERYBODY HATES CHRIS #056
"Earth Day"
Closed Captioned

00:02.703 --> 00:04.605
CHRIS ROCK:
Every school year,
there were always days

00:04.638 --> 00:07.441
when students had to do
special assignments.

00:07.475 --> 00:09.577
Good morning, everybody.

00:09.610 --> 00:10.744
Some were easy,
like Thanksgiving.

00:10.778 --> 00:12.313
Your assignment

00:12.346 --> 00:16.484
is to write a report
about what you're thankful for.

00:16.517 --> 00:18.286
And Martin Luther King Day.

00:18.319 --> 00:19.587
Your assignment

00:19.620 --> 00:22.490
is to report
about what you would dream about

00:22.523 --> 00:25.059
if you were about to be shot.

00:25.093 --> 00:26.460
Some were a lot harder.

00:26.494 --> 00:29.563
This week is my favorite
holiday: Earth Day.

00:29.597 --> 00:32.400
Or, as you would say, Chris,
Earf Day.

00:32.433 --> 00:34.502
If you live on Earth,
isn't every day Earth Day?

00:34.535 --> 00:36.070
What's Earth Day?

00:36.104 --> 00:38.772
Well, Chris, people are
destroying the planet

00:38.806 --> 00:41.709
with things like plastic bags
and cans, bottles,

00:41.742 --> 00:44.112
and indestructible foodstuffs.

00:44.145 --> 00:48.716
On Earth Day, we put forth our
best efforts to save the planet.

00:48.749 --> 00:50.784
I thought saving the planet
was a waste of time,

00:50.818 --> 00:53.554
because I was too busy
trying to save me.

00:53.587 --> 00:56.857
I tried saving my face.

00:56.890 --> 01:01.495
I tried saving my ass.

01:01.529 --> 01:02.830
I even tried saving

01:02.863 --> 01:04.165
my future kid's ass.

01:05.533 --> 01:08.169
To this day, I love geography.

01:08.202 --> 01:11.639
Your assignment is to do
something you think

01:11.672 --> 01:13.841
will help save the Earth.

01:13.874 --> 01:15.075
Greg.

01:15.109 --> 01:18.512
You mean something like building
a solar

01:18.546 --> 01:20.114
Isn't that what the beach is?

01:20.148 --> 01:21.582
That's very good, Greg.

01:22.716 --> 01:24.485
Chris, what would you
like to do?

01:24.518 --> 01:27.621
I knew my dad had a truck
and Bed-Stuy was a mess.

01:27.655 --> 01:29.890
So I had the perfect project.

01:29.923 --> 01:32.460
Uh, collect cans
and recycle them?

01:32.493 --> 01:34.228
That's wonderful.

01:34.262 --> 01:35.329
Then you could

01:35.363 --> 01:38.332
take the money and do something
for the environment.

01:38.366 --> 01:39.600
You could plant a tree.

01:39.633 --> 01:41.402
Maybe I could plant
my foot in your b...

01:49.443 --> 01:51.645
* Ah, make it funky now.

02:08.396 --> 02:11.465

02:14.302 --> 02:16.537
Having my father help me
with my Earth Day project

02:16.570 --> 02:19.240
seemed like a great idea
until he found out about it.

02:19.273 --> 02:20.441
Earth Day?

02:20.474 --> 02:21.909
It's the day we try
to save the Earth.

02:21.942 --> 02:23.411
I have a project
to do, too.

02:23.444 --> 02:24.945
Well, Earth Day must
not be too important

02:24.978 --> 02:26.414
if I still got
to go to work.

02:26.447 --> 02:27.815
Are the banks closed?

02:27.848 --> 02:29.950
You still got to feed
the parking meters.

02:29.983 --> 02:31.952
And what are you doing
to save the Earth?

02:31.985 --> 02:34.655
I'm recycling cans, and the
money I make I'm going to use

02:34.688 --> 02:35.656
to help the environment.

02:35.689 --> 02:36.690
Just like the Republicans.

02:36.724 --> 02:38.859
I don't know, Chris.

02:38.892 --> 02:40.594
Sounds like it might
take too much time.

02:40.628 --> 02:43.897
Julius, your son is trying
to save the Earth.

02:43.931 --> 02:45.466
Are you going
to help him or not?

02:45.499 --> 02:47.901
My father had been asked
that question before,

02:47.935 --> 02:49.603
and there was only
one right answer,

02:49.637 --> 02:50.738
whether it was something
minor...

02:50.771 --> 02:55.876
Are you going to do
the dishes or not?

02:55.909 --> 02:57.345
Or something major.

02:57.378 --> 03:00.381
Are you going
to propose to me or not?

03:03.384 --> 03:04.618
Here you go, baby.

03:04.652 --> 03:06.854
Oh!

03:06.887 --> 03:08.356
Thank you.

03:08.389 --> 03:10.424
See?

03:10.458 --> 03:12.693
Sure, I'll help you out.

03:12.726 --> 03:17.431
Here's your first can.
I hope you get an "A."

03:17.465 --> 03:18.699
Thanks, Dad.

03:21.769 --> 03:23.237
What are you doing, boy?

03:23.271 --> 03:25.406
I have to build a car
out of this piece of wood.

03:25.439 --> 03:26.540
I want to know what you're
doing with my potatoes.

03:26.574 --> 03:28.809
That's how I'm going
to power it.

03:28.842 --> 03:29.877
It's environmentally
friendly.

03:29.910 --> 03:32.746
You wasting my potatoes
is butt-whipping friendly.

03:32.780 --> 03:34.515
Me and Drew were trying
to save the world,

03:34.548 --> 03:36.917
but Tonya was about to be
in a world of trouble.

03:36.950 --> 03:38.652
Listen to this:
"Dear Parent,

03:38.686 --> 03:39.653
"Your daughter Tonya
has been cited

03:39.687 --> 03:40.788
"for a conduct violation,

03:40.821 --> 03:43.924
and your presence is being
requested for a conference."

03:43.957 --> 03:45.926
What kind
of conduct violation?

03:45.959 --> 03:48.396
She said I was being
rude and belligerent.

03:48.429 --> 03:49.930
Ain't no damn body
rude and belligerent.

03:49.963 --> 03:51.665
I'm going
to go down there

03:51.699 --> 03:53.267
and show them what
rude and belligerent is.

03:53.301 --> 03:54.368
No kidding.

03:54.402 --> 03:55.536
Rude and belligerent.

03:55.569 --> 03:57.471
While I had my father
on my side,

03:57.505 --> 04:00.441
my mother was going to get
a teacher off of Tonya's back.

04:00.474 --> 04:03.477
I don't see why I have to take
a whole day off of work,

04:03.511 --> 04:04.945
to come down here
for this nonsense.

04:04.978 --> 04:06.980
I don't think it's nonsense.

04:07.014 --> 04:08.682
Tonya was exhibiting
some aggressive behavior

04:08.716 --> 04:09.550
toward a classmate.

04:09.583 --> 04:11.385
I just wanted you
to be aware of it.

04:11.419 --> 04:14.688
I was just trying to read,
and she wouldn't be quiet.

04:14.722 --> 04:16.056
Girl, you interrupt
me again,

04:16.089 --> 04:17.725
I'm going to knock
the sound out of your mouth.

04:19.393 --> 04:21.962
How is she being
aggressive?

04:21.995 --> 04:27.067
Apparently, Tonya turned toward
her study partner and said this.

04:31.672 --> 04:33.541
Did you say this?

04:33.574 --> 04:35.576
Sorta.

04:35.609 --> 04:38.412
Well, she was trying
to study, right?

04:38.446 --> 04:41.315
That's not the point.
Oh, well, I think it is.

04:41.349 --> 04:45.018
This is school, and her behavior
will not be tolerated.

04:45.052 --> 04:46.687
Her behavior?

04:46.720 --> 04:48.756
What about the other
little girl's behavior?

04:48.789 --> 04:50.724
Why don't you have her mother
come down here

04:50.758 --> 04:52.360
and tell her kid to shut up

04:52.393 --> 04:53.794
while my baby
is trying to study?

04:53.827 --> 04:55.095
That's neither here nor there.

04:55.128 --> 04:57.498
Then please, where is it?

04:57.531 --> 04:58.732
What I'd like to ask is

04:58.766 --> 05:00.901
do you know where Tonya
got this language from?

05:00.934 --> 05:03.504
My mother had two answers
to that question.

05:03.537 --> 05:04.772
Answer A:

05:04.805 --> 05:07.808
She got it from this knot I'm
about to put upside your head.

05:07.841 --> 05:09.410
And Answer B:

05:09.443 --> 05:12.346
Well, I don't know,
but it won't happen again.

05:12.380 --> 05:13.947
Have a nice day.
Tonya, come on.

05:13.981 --> 05:16.717
I want to get
transferred.

05:16.750 --> 05:17.751
Girl, don't backtalk me
right now.

05:17.785 --> 05:18.952
Now is not the time.

05:18.986 --> 05:21.489
Later, I found out
that before Al Gore,

05:21.522 --> 05:24.024
people had no idea what to do
to save the Earth.

05:24.057 --> 05:25.659
If you want to save the Earth,

05:25.693 --> 05:27.761
you better figure out
what to do about them Russians.

05:27.795 --> 05:29.096
They got bombs.

05:29.129 --> 05:30.831
My whole family worked
in the fields.

05:30.864 --> 05:32.132
I hate fields.

05:32.165 --> 05:33.767
I love concrete.

05:33.801 --> 05:36.370
You can't grow cotton
on concrete.

05:36.404 --> 05:38.872
I help the environment
by driving as much as I can.

05:38.906 --> 05:39.973
You ever ride that train?

05:40.007 --> 05:41.609
That train is filthy, man.

05:41.642 --> 05:44.645
You know it's dirty as hell
when rats got footies on.

05:44.678 --> 05:46.113
You want to save this planet?

05:46.146 --> 05:49.717
Get rid of them trains.
Get rid of them trains.

05:49.750 --> 05:52.019
I help the environment
by wearing wigs.

05:52.052 --> 05:54.488
People put a whole lot
of chemicals in their hair.

05:54.522 --> 05:55.889
Then they wash it out.

05:55.923 --> 05:57.391
It goes right into the river.

05:57.425 --> 05:58.592
People got to drink that water.

05:58.626 --> 06:01.795
When you done with a wig,
just flush it down the toilet.

06:01.829 --> 06:04.898
If it ends up in your glass,
well, at least you can see it.

06:04.932 --> 06:07.801
I use "I Can't Believe
This Is Not Margarine."

06:07.835 --> 06:09.403
It tastes real great.

06:09.437 --> 06:14.107
Plus it has paudridridamadra-
hydraglycerin.

06:14.141 --> 06:15.909
That saves cows.

06:15.943 --> 06:18.646
If the Earth died,
that would be tragic,

06:18.679 --> 06:20.881
but I sure like
to sell that coffin.

06:20.914 --> 06:22.583
So how'd it go with Tonya?

06:22.616 --> 06:24.184
Her teacher is crazy.
That's how it went.

06:24.217 --> 06:25.453
What happened?

06:25.486 --> 06:27.955
I was trying to study and this
girl kept talking so I told her:

06:27.988 --> 06:29.523
:
"If you don't shut up

06:29.557 --> 06:30.891
"I'm going to slap
the chatter out of you."

06:30.924 --> 06:32.192
And she left me alone.

06:32.225 --> 06:33.994
Wow, you sound just like mom.

06:34.027 --> 06:35.463
No, she doesn't.

06:35.496 --> 06:37.498
She does.

06:38.165 --> 06:39.600
I mean, just a little.

06:39.633 --> 06:41.735
So you think
that this is my fault?

06:41.769 --> 06:43.737
Well, you do kind of
always yell.

06:43.771 --> 06:46.740
Okay, then fine, I'll stop.

06:48.141 --> 06:50.978
What

06:51.011 --> 06:52.079
You're going to stop yelling?

06:52.112 --> 06:54.081
Yes, I'm going to stop yelling.

06:54.114 --> 06:55.849
You just watch.

06:55.883 --> 06:58.552
I got five dollars says
you won't last a week.

06:58.586 --> 07:00.754
Bet.

07:03.090 --> 07:04.858
Getting my father
to agree to help me

07:04.892 --> 07:06.660
with my project was one thing.

07:06.694 --> 07:08.962
Getting him to actually help
was something else.

07:08.996 --> 07:10.130
Dad.

07:10.163 --> 07:11.565
Dad.

07:11.599 --> 07:12.733
Hmm?

07:12.766 --> 07:14.234
You think we can go out
and get started?

07:14.267 --> 07:16.203
Started on what?

07:16.236 --> 07:17.871
Collecting cans.

07:17.905 --> 07:19.473
What cans?

07:19.507 --> 07:20.508
For my project.

07:20.541 --> 07:22.209
What project?
My school project.

07:22.242 --> 07:23.611
What school project?

07:23.644 --> 07:25.012
Collecting cans.

07:25.045 --> 07:27.915
Chris, I'm tired.

07:27.948 --> 07:29.517
Can't you do it yourself?

07:29.550 --> 07:33.086
Yeah, I guess I can start
by myself.

07:36.690 --> 07:39.793
A kid collecting cans
with his dad is recycling.

07:39.827 --> 07:42.963
A kid collecting cans
by himself is bum practice.

07:42.996 --> 07:44.632
Dad?

07:44.665 --> 07:49.937
Well Earth, It's just us.

07:52.940 --> 07:54.908
Since my dad wouldn't help me,

07:54.942 --> 07:59.279
I had no choice but to collect
a few cans on my own.

07:59.312 --> 08:02.015
Unfortunately, you could turn
in cans for money,

08:02.049 --> 08:04.785
and every bum
in Bed-Stuy knew it.

08:04.818 --> 08:08.789
They may be bums,
but they're not lazy bums.

08:08.822 --> 08:09.923
Hey, Chris.

08:09.957 --> 08:11.592
What are you doing in there?

08:11.625 --> 08:12.626
Collecting cans.

08:12.660 --> 08:14.127
Turn in enough,

08:14.161 --> 08:16.964
get a lot of cash, plus,
it's good for the environment.

08:16.997 --> 08:18.599
What are you doing, soldier?

08:18.632 --> 08:20.233
I'm trying to collect cans, too.

08:20.267 --> 08:21.735
It's for my Earth Day project.

08:21.769 --> 08:23.571
Want to collect cans
around here?

08:23.604 --> 08:24.705
You got to be quick.

08:24.738 --> 08:26.039
Yeah, I guess so.

08:32.145 --> 08:34.047
Got to be quicker than that.

08:39.953 --> 08:42.022
After a couple of days,

08:42.055 --> 08:44.124
my can project
was going down the toilet.

08:44.157 --> 08:45.659
You've got to be quick
to get the cans.

08:45.693 --> 08:46.627
That's a big business.

08:46.660 --> 08:48.662
I thought my dad was
going to be helping me.

08:48.696 --> 08:49.697
This was supposed
to be easy.

08:49.730 --> 08:51.198
Maybe you should
switch projects.

08:51.231 --> 08:52.132
Yeah, now all I have to do

08:52.165 --> 08:54.201
is come up with a
solar-powered excuse.

08:54.234 --> 08:57.237
I'd help you, but I ran
into a major problem.

08:57.270 --> 08:58.305
What happened?

08:58.338 --> 09:00.273
While I was making
my tanning bed,

09:00.307 --> 09:03.310
I accidentally invented
an incandescent light bulb

09:03.343 --> 09:05.813
that won't burn out
for 600 years.

09:05.846 --> 09:07.948
That's amazing. Then
you'll definitely get an "A."

09:07.981 --> 09:09.983
I can't turn that in.
Why not?

09:10.017 --> 09:12.252
Are you crazy?
I'd be a marked man.

09:12.285 --> 09:14.922
I'm not taking down every major
power company in the nation.

09:14.955 --> 09:16.924
They'd have me
killed in a minute.

09:16.957 --> 09:18.992
So I decided to switch projects.

09:19.026 --> 09:21.829
I'm going with
a dung-powered radar system.

09:21.862 --> 09:25.098
US patent #D349127.

09:25.132 --> 09:27.267
So what are you
going to do?

09:27.300 --> 09:29.369
Well, I figure there's a bunch
of cans around here somewhere.

09:29.402 --> 09:31.271
I might as well
just keep looking.

09:31.304 --> 09:32.606
See these two little
cup

09:32.640 --> 09:33.774
Mm

09:33.807 --> 09:35.909
Put the potatoes in them.

09:35.943 --> 09:38.045
Take one of these
little electrodes

09:38.078 --> 09:39.246
and plunge it
into the potato there,

09:39.279 --> 09:42.950
and take the other one and
plunge it into the other potato.

09:42.983 --> 09:44.985
Back at home,
my mother needed help, too.

09:45.018 --> 09:48.188
Drew, what is all this stuff
on the table?

09:48.221 --> 09:50.357
Boy, you better clean this table
before I knock...!

09:50.390 --> 09:51.825
Are you yelling?

09:51.859 --> 09:53.360
No.

09:56.196 --> 09:57.397
Sweetie.

09:57.430 --> 09:59.667
When you get a chance...

09:59.700 --> 10:01.635
would you mind
putting this stuff away,

10:01.669 --> 10:02.970
so I-I-I can set the table
for dinner?

10:03.003 --> 10:04.672
Yeah, I'll do it in a minute.

10:06.840 --> 10:08.709
Hi, Tonya.

10:08.742 --> 10:11.278
Did Daddy say you could have
ice cream before dinner?

10:11.311 --> 10:13.380
Nope, but I got hungry.

10:13.413 --> 10:15.082
But Tonya,
it's almost dinnertime.

10:15.115 --> 10:16.817
I don't want you
to ruin your appetite.

10:16.850 --> 10:18.018
Mama, don't worry about it.

10:18.051 --> 10:20.087
I'm going to eat my dinner.

10:33.834 --> 10:35.836
Tonya, why are you reading

10:35.869 --> 10:36.670
at the table?

10:36.704 --> 10:37.838
Why aren't you eating
your dinner?

10:37.871 --> 10:39.139
I'm just not hungry.

10:39.172 --> 10:40.741
Hmm, well,

10:40.774 --> 10:42.743
maybe it's all that ice cream
you had before dinner.

10:42.776 --> 10:43.343
Yeah, maybe.

10:43.376 --> 10:44.211
Who said

10:44.244 --> 10:45.779
you could eat ice cream
before dinner?

10:45.813 --> 10:46.313
Nobody.

10:46.346 --> 10:47.881
That's the
problem.

10:47.915 --> 10:48.348
What?

10:48.381 --> 10:49.817
Nothing.

10:52.252 --> 10:53.320
So,

10:53.353 --> 10:54.021
Chris,

10:54.054 --> 10:55.789
how's your project coming along?

10:57.858 --> 10:58.959
Okay.

10:58.992 --> 11:01.161
Um, me and Dad are just trying
to figure out a time

11:01.194 --> 11:02.963
that's good for us
to go looking for cans.

11:02.996 --> 11:04.832
Yeah, we're working on the time.

11:04.865 --> 11:06.033
Oh, okay, that's nice.

11:06.066 --> 11:07.334
I'm sure you two
will work it out.

11:07.367 --> 11:09.402
Mm-hmm.

11:09.436 --> 11:11.371
Well, I finally figured out
my project.

11:11.404 --> 11:13.206
I hope you figured out
how to clean that mess up.

11:14.241 --> 11:16.343
I-I built a potato clock.

11:16.376 --> 11:19.312
Now all I have
to do is paint it.

11:19.346 --> 11:20.413
Paint?

11:20.447 --> 11:21.782
On my dining room table?

11:21.815 --> 11:23.717
Mm-hmm.

11:23.751 --> 11:26.353
Oh, no, you don't.

11:26.386 --> 11:27.721
You're not getting me.

11:27.755 --> 11:29.356
I'm keeping
that five dollars.

11:29.389 --> 11:31.358
Paint all you want.

11:31.391 --> 11:33.026
Paint 20 potatoes

11:33.060 --> 11:34.828
if you have to, Drew.

11:34.862 --> 11:35.729
Are those my good potatoes?

11:35.763 --> 11:36.830
Not anymore!

11:36.864 --> 11:37.931
Yeah, but I'll
chop 'em up

11:37.965 --> 11:39.399
and make French fries
after I turn my project in.

11:39.432 --> 11:40.868
Hey, check it out.

11:40.901 --> 11:42.135
I put a calendar
on the front.

11:42.169 --> 11:44.271
I thought
you were supposed

11:44.304 --> 11:45.438
to be making a car.

11:45.472 --> 11:47.908
I thought you were supposed
to be eating your dinner.

11:47.941 --> 11:49.810
I was,

11:49.843 --> 11:52.746
but the potatoes were
too weak to run it.

11:52.780 --> 11:54.081
I wonder
how many potatoes we need

11:54.114 --> 11:55.382
to get rid of the light bill.

11:55.415 --> 11:58.118
Enough to make mashed potatoes
for the next million years.

11:58.151 --> 12:00.387
So Dad, you think you could pick
me up after school tomorrow?

12:00.420 --> 12:01.755
For what?

12:01.789 --> 12:03.924
To pick up cans.

12:03.957 --> 12:07.460
Yeah, yeah, cans.

12:07.494 --> 12:09.062
No problem.

12:09.096 --> 12:11.064
Work tomorrow? No problem.

12:11.098 --> 12:14.067
Unfortunately for me,
if you offer my dad a job,

12:14.101 --> 12:15.936
he forgot
about everything else.

12:15.969 --> 12:17.938
So Dad, I'm going
to come straight home

12:17.971 --> 12:19.172
after school
tomorrow, okay?

12:19.206 --> 12:21.408
Oh, I'm sorry, Chris.

12:21.441 --> 12:23.476
I just picked up
an extra shift.

12:23.510 --> 12:25.078
I get paid time
and a half, but,

12:25.112 --> 12:26.379
hey, you're doing
okay though, right?

12:26.413 --> 12:28.982
Yeah, Dad, I'm fine.

12:29.016 --> 12:30.984
All right, I knew you would.

12:31.018 --> 12:32.953
You're the man.
That's my boy.

12:35.923 --> 12:37.925
We learned the reason
my mother yelled

12:37.958 --> 12:39.559
wasn't because
she liked yelling.

12:39.592 --> 12:43.096
It was because if she didn't
yell, no one would hear her.

12:43.130 --> 12:44.164
Drew, wake up.

12:44.197 --> 12:46.299
Hey, right.

12:46.333 --> 12:47.968
Chris, you're going
to be late.

12:48.001 --> 12:49.302
I'm coming.

12:49.336 --> 12:51.104
Okay, fine.

12:51.138 --> 12:52.239
Don't go to school.

12:52.272 --> 12:54.808
Grow up stupid.

12:56.309 --> 12:58.545
Tonya, wake up, baby.

12:58.578 --> 13:00.547
All right, all right.

13:00.580 --> 13:03.116
Five more minutes.

13:08.989 --> 13:10.590
See?

13:10.623 --> 13:12.425
Oh, this is
what I'm talking about.

13:12.459 --> 13:14.427
I tried to be nice

13:14.461 --> 13:16.429
and this is the thanks I get.

13:16.463 --> 13:19.432
Yeah, I try not to be
rude and belligerent.

13:19.466 --> 13:21.601
If I wasn't, nothing
would get done around here.

13:21.634 --> 13:23.603
But that's okay.

13:23.636 --> 13:26.974
Oh, okay, I guess I'm supposed
to clean this up too?

13:27.007 --> 13:29.242
Oh, no, no, no problem,
Mr. Potato.

13:29.276 --> 13:30.310
I'll clean you up.

13:30.343 --> 13:31.945
I have nothing else
better to do.

13:31.979 --> 13:33.947
No, please, you sit right there.

13:33.981 --> 13:35.949
I'll be back.
No, really, stay!

13:35.983 --> 13:37.951
No, it's okay.

13:37.985 --> 13:40.287
It's okay because...

13:42.655 --> 13:45.926
Now that is just nasty.

13:45.959 --> 13:49.262
After searching around,
I found a few cans,

13:49.296 --> 13:51.398
but what I really needed
was some help.

13:55.335 --> 14:00.040
* Whoa, oh, mercy, mercy me...

14:00.073 --> 14:02.943
There he is, Officer.
That's the man.

14:02.976 --> 14:05.012
* Oh, things ain't what...

14:05.045 --> 14:07.014
That's my boy.

14:07.047 --> 14:09.482
If I ever needed my dad's help,
I needed it then.

14:09.516 --> 14:11.018
Dad?

14:12.319 --> 14:13.286
Dad!

14:15.322 --> 14:17.290
Dad... ah, dang it!

14:17.324 --> 14:18.291
Wait!

14:20.693 --> 14:22.229
Move, move, move.

14:29.336 --> 14:31.338
Dad?

14:31.371 --> 14:33.140
I'm not your daddy.

14:41.348 --> 14:42.349
Am I?

14:42.382 --> 14:43.516
No.

14:43.550 --> 14:45.552
Thank you, God.

15:00.600 --> 15:02.669
Hey, baby, what you doing?

15:02.702 --> 15:05.372
I looked everywhere
and I couldn't find any cans.

15:05.405 --> 15:06.606
So I figured I'd get my own.

15:06.639 --> 15:08.075
Want a soda?

15:08.108 --> 15:09.342
Yeah, thanks.

15:09.376 --> 15:10.577
You mean to tell me

15:10.610 --> 15:12.345
you and your daddy
couldn't find one can?

15:12.379 --> 15:15.983
I didn't want to tell on my
dad, but I didn't want to lie.

15:16.016 --> 15:19.319
Well, Dad hasn't really had
any time

15:19.352 --> 15:20.954
to come looking for cans
with me.

15:20.988 --> 15:23.256
He's been working.

15:23.290 --> 15:25.292
Really.

15:25.325 --> 15:27.427
My project was on its last leg.

15:27.460 --> 15:30.163
And for my mother,
that was the last straw.

15:30.197 --> 15:31.364
Julius, wake up!

15:31.398 --> 15:33.000
Oh, oh, what's going on?
What

15:33.033 --> 15:35.002
I thought you were gonna help
Chris with his homework.

15:35.035 --> 15:36.203
I was. I am.

15:36.236 --> 15:37.404
When?

15:37.437 --> 15:38.405
I don't know.

15:38.438 --> 15:40.073
Rochelle, I've been working.

15:40.107 --> 15:42.309
Oh, and I've just been laying
around the house all day?

15:42.342 --> 15:43.310
Is that what it is?

15:43.343 --> 15:45.178
I ask you
to help that boy

15:45.212 --> 15:47.714
with one homework assignment,
in what, 15 years?!

15:47.747 --> 15:49.549
And you can't
even do that!

15:49.582 --> 15:51.618
All I ask you to do
is take the boy

15:51.651 --> 15:53.286
and pick up some cans.

15:53.320 --> 15:54.521
I'm sorry.

15:54.554 --> 15:56.456
"I'm sorry"? You ought to be!

15:56.489 --> 15:58.258
Your son needed
your help

15:58.291 --> 16:02.529
with one school assignment,
but, no, you were too busy.

16:02.562 --> 16:04.531
But, baby...

16:04.564 --> 16:06.233
But

16:06.266 --> 16:07.767
Are you going to help him
or not?

16:07.800 --> 16:10.103
Mmm.

16:10.137 --> 16:12.139
That's exactly what I thought.

16:12.172 --> 16:13.540
Hmm.

16:13.573 --> 16:15.175
Take your money.

16:16.209 --> 16:19.679
I'm back!

16:21.714 --> 16:23.583
Dad?

16:26.553 --> 16:28.688
What's wrong?

16:28.721 --> 16:30.223
What happened?

16:30.257 --> 16:31.558
Whoa, calm down.

16:31.591 --> 16:33.426
I'm here to help you
with your Earth Day project.

16:33.460 --> 16:35.062
I thought you had to work.

16:35.095 --> 16:36.296
I do.

16:36.329 --> 16:37.764
Now let's go get these cans.

16:37.797 --> 16:41.601
* People, let me tell you
about my best friend *

16:41.634 --> 16:45.238
* He's a warm-hearted person
who loves me to the end *

16:45.272 --> 16:49.476
* Now, people, let me tell you
about my best friend *

16:49.509 --> 16:54.547
* He's a one boy, cuddly toy, my
up, my down, my pride and joy *

16:54.581 --> 16:56.349
* People, let me tell you
about him *

16:56.383 --> 16:57.217
* He's so much fun

16:57.250 --> 17:00.220
* Whether we're talkin'
man to man *

17:00.253 --> 17:02.389
* Or whether we're talking
son to son *

17:02.422 --> 17:05.225
* 'Cause he's my best friend

17:05.258 --> 17:09.429
* Yes, he's my best friend...

17:09.462 --> 17:11.464
:
Whoa!

17:15.535 --> 17:17.470
Looks pretty full.

17:17.504 --> 17:18.705
Yeah, so you want
to take it

17:18.738 --> 17:20.207
to the recycling center?

17:20.240 --> 17:21.708
No, let's take it
first thing in the morning.

17:21.741 --> 17:23.576
Yeah.

17:29.349 --> 17:31.318
So, Tonya,

17:31.351 --> 17:33.586
I know you heard me
scream yesterday.

17:33.620 --> 17:35.622
Yeah, are you sorry?

17:35.655 --> 17:37.624
No, I'm not sorry

17:37.657 --> 17:39.492
and I'll tell you why.

17:39.526 --> 17:42.695
You can only talk that way
to someone when you love them.

17:42.729 --> 17:44.264
But you have to be nice

17:44.297 --> 17:45.732
to the people
that you don't know.

17:45.765 --> 17:48.568
But that doesn't
make any sense.

17:48.601 --> 17:50.870
No, it doesn't
make any sense,

17:50.903 --> 17:52.872
but it so happens
to be true.

17:52.905 --> 17:54.707
Like when Bush got reelected.

17:54.741 --> 17:58.145
How can it be true
if it doesn't make any sense?

17:58.178 --> 18:00.613
Because that's just
the way the truth is.

18:00.647 --> 18:02.782
Oh.

18:02.815 --> 18:04.817
So this means that
I'm going to go back

18:04.851 --> 18:06.653
to yelling
at everybody.

18:06.686 --> 18:08.288
Because you love us?

18:08.321 --> 18:09.456
Exactly.

18:09.489 --> 18:11.624
So I can yell
at you, too?

18:11.658 --> 18:13.326
Mmm, if you want
the fillings

18:13.360 --> 18:15.328
knocked out of your face,
go right ahead.

18:28.475 --> 18:30.343
Sorry you had to miss work
for this, Dad.

18:30.377 --> 18:31.511
That's okay.

18:31.544 --> 18:32.812
So how much money
did you make?

18:32.845 --> 18:33.880
$100

18:33.913 --> 18:35.148
Six.

18:35.182 --> 18:36.183
$600?!

18:36.216 --> 18:37.450
No, six dollars.

18:37.484 --> 18:39.386
I can't do anything
with this.

18:39.419 --> 18:41.354
How am I supposed to save
the Earth with six dollars?

18:44.224 --> 18:45.425
You know what, Chris?

18:45.458 --> 18:48.695
To some people
six dollars is a lot of money.

18:49.829 --> 18:53.400
You said you wanted
to help the planet.

18:56.303 --> 18:57.904
Hey, Kill Moves.

18:57.937 --> 18:59.472
Konnichiwa!

18:59.506 --> 19:00.673
Oh.

19:00.707 --> 19:01.641
Hey, Chris.

19:01.674 --> 19:02.842
I got something for you.

19:02.875 --> 19:04.477
Uh, what's this for?

19:04.511 --> 19:05.345
Earth Day.

19:05.378 --> 19:06.613
Earth Day, huh?

19:06.646 --> 19:07.947
Hmm, thanks.

19:07.980 --> 19:10.350
Hey,

19:10.383 --> 19:11.484
Happy Earth Day.

19:11.518 --> 19:15.355
Let's get you to school.

19:15.388 --> 19:17.257
People talk
about saving the planet

19:17.290 --> 19:18.691
by picking up
cansand bottles,

19:18.725 --> 19:21.261
but the one thing
I learned from Earth Day

19:21.294 --> 19:23.630
was that saving the planet
meant a lot to me,

19:23.663 --> 19:27.367
but doing it with my father
meant the world to me.

19:30.303 --> 19:34.207
So, Chris, tell us
about your Earth Day project.

19:34.241 --> 19:36.776
Oh, well, me and
my dad collected
a truckful of cans.

19:36.809 --> 19:38.845
Chris, that's wonderful.

19:38.878 --> 19:40.713
And I gave the money
to somebody less fortunate.

19:40.747 --> 19:42.749
I mean, there's no reason
to save the Earth

19:42.782 --> 19:43.783
if you can't save the people.

19:43.816 --> 19:47.320
Oh, Chris, that's so profound.

19:47.354 --> 19:49.489
Other than the fact
that you can see,

19:49.522 --> 19:51.491
Stevie Wonder's
got nothing on you.

19:52.992 --> 19:54.827
I know in my heart,

19:54.861 --> 19:59.366
that money is somehow
going to help us all.

19:59.399 --> 20:03.803
So we have
13 Styrofoam ice chests,

20:03.836 --> 20:06.506
four cans
of aerosol spray paint,

20:06.539 --> 20:09.509
one pack of cigarettes,
a gallon of whisky

20:09.542 --> 20:12.979
and one container of "I Can't
Believe It's Not Margarine."

20:13.012 --> 20:15.982
Would that be paper or plastic?

20:16.015 --> 20:19.352
Plastic.

20:19.386 --> 20:22.789
* Everybody Hates Chris.

20:22.822 --> 20:25.292
