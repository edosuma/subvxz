WEBVTT

01:54.017 --> 01:55.849
Rodrigo!

01:56.924 --> 01:59.585
We have a cease fire!

01:59.654 --> 02:02.422
Why did you kill my officers?

02:27.248 --> 02:28.882
Rodrigo.

02:29.958 --> 02:31.483
Rodrigo, drop your weapon!

02:31.552 --> 02:33.227
Down on your knees!

02:34.093 --> 02:35.625
Down on your knees!

03:50.231 --> 03:53.204
Major, the rebels don't have
air support large enough

03:53.273 --> 03:55.276
to level an area this size.

03:58.009 --> 04:00.642
There's no smell of conventional
ordnance, no smell of petroleum.

04:00.711 --> 04:01.640
They must have access
to something

04:01.709 --> 04:03.175
we're not aware of yet.

04:03.244 --> 04:04.713
Then, respectfully, sir,
why don't we eliminate them

04:04.782 --> 04:06.353
before they destroy
a vital target?

04:06.422 --> 04:07.580
This is an international
peacekeeping mission,

04:07.648 --> 04:09.148
not a sanctioned war.

04:09.217 --> 04:10.919
The only reason your unit's
even here is to assist

04:10.988 --> 04:13.259
in the identification of these
unexplained demolitions.

04:13.328 --> 04:14.588
And, so far,
you've done a pretty

04:14.657 --> 04:15.894
piss poor job of it, Lieutenant.

04:20.863 --> 04:22.836
Since when does Brazil
get earthquakes?

04:22.905 --> 04:23.898
I don't know, sir.

04:26.804 --> 04:28.240
Could these tremors
be tied to something

04:28.309 --> 04:30.076
that's causing
this devastation?

04:30.145 --> 04:33.112
Some kind of induced seismicity?

04:33.181 --> 04:35.046
You mean like fracking, sir?

04:35.115 --> 04:36.777
Yeah, possibly that.

04:36.846 --> 04:38.880
But what would be
the cause of this?

04:41.820 --> 04:43.753
That's what we're here
to find out for you, sir.

04:47.262 --> 04:49.661
Zeus, Scavenger.
Come in, Zeus.

04:49.730 --> 04:52.326
We read you, Scavenger.
The general is inbound.

05:05.276 --> 05:06.873
General Norris.

05:06.942 --> 05:09.476
I have Scavenger
on the line, ma'am.

05:09.545 --> 05:11.616
What's your SITREP?

05:11.685 --> 05:13.418
We've yet to identify
a signature, ma'am.

05:13.487 --> 05:15.120
Seismic weaponry may
be a possibility

05:15.188 --> 05:16.788
regarding the tremors.

05:16.856 --> 05:19.391
But still doesn't account
for the source of demolitions.

05:19.460 --> 05:21.462
Rule out any type
of seismic weaponry.

05:21.530 --> 05:24.031
We're receiving reports
of global vulnerabilities

05:24.100 --> 05:26.032
in kind, not just in Brazil.

05:26.101 --> 05:27.565
Did you say global, ma'am?

05:27.634 --> 05:29.129
-Is this a coordinated attack?

05:29.197 --> 05:31.838
Hold on, Scavenger.
Would you turn that thing off?

05:31.907 --> 05:33.265
Yes, General.

05:33.334 --> 05:36.372
Scavenger, we are not dealing
with weaponized systems.

05:36.441 --> 05:37.939
I don't understand, ma'am.

05:38.008 --> 05:39.813
We're seeing a variety
of natural disasters

05:39.882 --> 05:40.840
around the globe.

05:40.909 --> 05:44.148
Earthquakes,
fires, floods,

05:44.217 --> 05:46.084
tornados, tsunamis,

05:46.153 --> 05:49.121
even locust swarms.

05:49.190 --> 05:50.886
Locust swarms, General?

05:53.929 --> 05:56.096
Affirmative.

05:56.165 --> 05:57.696
You've been around the world.

05:57.764 --> 06:00.262
You've seen a few battlefields
in your day, as have I.

06:00.331 --> 06:02.069
Now you tell me.

06:02.138 --> 06:03.602
What does this look like to you?

06:04.970 --> 06:07.140
Sounds like something out
of the book of Revelations,

06:07.209 --> 06:09.740
the end of the world, ma'am.

06:09.809 --> 06:11.709
The frequency and severity
of these disasters

06:11.778 --> 06:14.348
are increasing and
Cal-Tech has determined

06:14.417 --> 06:15.776
that they're originating
from a location

06:15.845 --> 06:19.314
near you at an
exponential rate.

06:19.383 --> 06:20.818
Say again, ma'am?

06:20.886 --> 06:24.286
These vulnerabilities
are occurring near you.

06:24.355 --> 06:25.788
Copy that, ma'am.

06:25.857 --> 06:29.027
You mention "geothermal"
as in volcanic?

06:29.096 --> 06:30.328
Affirmative.

06:30.397 --> 06:31.995
Now I need you to listen to me.

06:32.064 --> 06:34.197
Our priorities in Brazil have
changed effective immediately.

06:34.266 --> 06:35.801
Yes, ma'am.

06:35.869 --> 06:37.637
I'm assembling a team
of scientists who are experts

06:37.706 --> 06:41.407
in the field of volcanology,
meteorology and mycology.

06:41.476 --> 06:43.270
I'm dispatching them
to your location.

06:43.339 --> 06:44.604
And they will do everything
that they can within their power

06:44.673 --> 06:46.240
to stop this thing.

06:46.309 --> 06:51.279
As of now, your new assignment
is to provide a security detail

06:51.348 --> 06:54.350
and assist the scientists in any
way that they deem necessary.

06:54.419 --> 06:55.615
Is that understood?

06:55.684 --> 06:57.184
Affirmative, ma'am.

06:57.253 --> 06:59.656
Expect the arrival of these
scientists within hours.

06:59.725 --> 07:02.461
As of right now, we have
a 12-hour window

07:02.530 --> 07:03.891
before the eruption
that will end

07:03.960 --> 07:05.891
life on this planet
as we know it.

07:05.960 --> 07:08.496
And that timeframe is subject

07:08.565 --> 07:10.035
to change pending intel.

07:10.104 --> 07:11.163
Copy, Zeus.

07:11.232 --> 07:13.434
New orders received
and understood.

07:13.503 --> 07:16.169
Scavenger out.

07:21.645 --> 07:23.111
What do you got for me, Aidan?

07:23.179 --> 07:25.518
Okay, these are our top
candidates all within

07:25.587 --> 07:26.786
hour's travel time
to Brazil, General.

07:26.855 --> 07:28.016
Hm.

07:32.654 --> 07:34.189
Lynise Hughes.

07:34.257 --> 07:35.787
This is Colonel Nathan Hughes's
daughter, isn't it?

07:35.856 --> 07:37.563
Yes, it is, General.

07:37.632 --> 07:39.194
Actually, it's why
I pulled her file.

07:39.262 --> 07:41.193
Not only has she worked
directly with the military,

07:41.262 --> 07:43.998
she's also one of the
best I her field.

07:44.067 --> 07:46.705
-Outstanding.
-I try my best, ma'am.

08:06.392 --> 08:08.189
This is Lynise Hughes.

08:08.258 --> 08:10.929
Dr. Lynise Hughes, this
is General Brigitte Norris

08:10.998 --> 08:13.565
calling you from the United
States Army on a secured line.

08:13.634 --> 08:15.064
I'm a colleague of
your father's.

08:15.132 --> 08:17.603
Hello, General Norris.
I can't talk right now.

08:17.672 --> 08:18.799
I'm in the middle
of something important.

08:18.868 --> 08:20.165
I'm outside of Mexico City.

08:20.234 --> 08:21.736
We're experience
volcanic activity here

08:21.805 --> 08:23.502
like I've never seen before.

08:23.571 --> 08:27.109
It's happening everywhere,
doctor, all across the globe.

08:27.178 --> 08:30.447
Every continent is experiencing
violent volcanoes,

08:30.516 --> 08:32.748
earthquakes and storms.

08:32.817 --> 08:34.148
Now we think that
we've pinpointed

08:34.216 --> 08:36.550
the epicenter of
these activities in Brazil.

08:36.619 --> 08:37.987
Wait. Brazil?

08:38.056 --> 08:40.352
But there shouldn't be
any volcanoes in Brazil.

08:40.421 --> 08:42.690
They're dormant.
They've been extinct forever.

08:42.758 --> 08:44.890
Not any more, doctor.

08:44.958 --> 08:47.464
I want you on the ground.

08:47.532 --> 08:48.732
I need your expertise.

08:48.801 --> 08:51.263
I want you to confirm it
is indeed Brazil

08:51.332 --> 08:53.233
as the source
of these disturbances,

08:53.302 --> 08:56.739
if we can stop it,
and how we can stop it.

08:56.808 --> 08:58.305
This is causing
a chain reaction

08:58.373 --> 09:00.541
of catastrophic
destruction around the world.

09:00.610 --> 09:02.376
Okay, okay.

09:02.445 --> 09:04.684
I'll need a minute to get down.
I'm on top of a mountain.

09:07.414 --> 09:09.954
A helicopter is
already enroute to you.

09:10.022 --> 09:11.988
They'll initiate contact
with you on this frequency

09:12.057 --> 09:13.989
and instruct you where
to be for extraction.

09:14.058 --> 09:16.055
I'll also have a full,
up to date report

09:16.124 --> 09:18.059
for you to review
on your travels.

09:18.128 --> 09:20.931
Okay, General, I'll be waiting.
Out.

09:29.743 --> 09:31.938
Meteorologist
Dakota Lenna, ma'am.

09:32.007 --> 09:33.605
Magna Cum Laude from M.I.T.

09:33.674 --> 09:36.383
She's currently assigned to
INM working on cloud seeding

09:36.451 --> 09:38.145
and weather patterns
in areas

09:38.214 --> 09:40.484
suffering from
wildfire devastation.

09:40.552 --> 09:42.051
Top of her game, General.

09:59.174 --> 10:00.339
Dakota! Dakota!

10:00.408 --> 10:01.340
-What?
-The Army!

10:01.409 --> 10:02.541
-What?
-The Army!

10:02.610 --> 10:03.840
They want to talk
to you right now!

10:03.909 --> 10:05.005
-The Army?
-Get back in the truck.

10:05.073 --> 10:07.413
It sounds important.
Come on.

10:07.482 --> 10:09.408
Why's the Army on the phone?

10:13.215 --> 10:16.586
Elliott Rodney, two PhDs,
one in mycology,

10:16.654 --> 10:18.021
the other in ecology.

10:18.090 --> 10:19.924
The reason I pulled his file
is he's worked

10:19.993 --> 10:22.388
with the DOD before
involving mycotoxins.

10:23.465 --> 10:25.197
Sounds good.
Call him up.

10:25.266 --> 10:26.700
Yes, ma'am.

11:24.353 --> 11:26.156
Dr. Hughes,
I'm Major Oakley Jones.

11:26.225 --> 11:29.627
This is Sergeant Shockley
and Lieutenant Rohrbacher.

11:29.696 --> 11:30.658
I'm glad you arrived safely.

11:30.727 --> 11:31.894
Thank you, Major.

11:31.963 --> 11:33.732
-Are you a man of faith?
-I am.

11:33.801 --> 11:35.363
Good, 'cause
we're gonna need it.

11:35.432 --> 11:37.766
We're expecting two more
scientists within the hour.

11:37.835 --> 11:39.168
So please come with me.

12:56.377 --> 12:58.050
Major, I meant
to ask you,

12:58.118 --> 13:00.452
I saw a lot of the country
burning on my flight in.

13:00.521 --> 13:01.621
Are they wildfires?

13:01.690 --> 13:03.954
Yes, ma'am.
Wildfires too.

13:04.022 --> 13:05.085
And I read in the report
that we're

13:05.154 --> 13:06.491
in the middle of a civil war?

13:06.560 --> 13:08.090
More of an uprising.

13:08.159 --> 13:10.227
Oh, so that's
the original mission

13:10.296 --> 13:12.129
that brought you down here,
fighting the rebels?

13:12.197 --> 13:15.197
Government tactical
assistance and guidance.

13:15.266 --> 13:16.695
But things have
changed drastically

13:16.763 --> 13:18.934
in the last 24 hours,
straining those efforts

13:19.003 --> 13:20.733
and altering our priorities.

13:20.802 --> 13:21.971
Clearly.

13:22.040 --> 13:23.270
Did you have a
chance to examine

13:23.339 --> 13:25.310
General Norris's file
on the way over?

13:25.379 --> 13:26.405
I did.

13:26.474 --> 13:28.311
Assuming all of these
global disasters

13:28.380 --> 13:30.776
can be traced to our current
events here in Brazil,

13:30.845 --> 13:35.352
what comes next is an eruption
that is orders of magnitude

13:35.420 --> 13:38.722
more powerful than anything
we've ever seen before.

13:38.791 --> 13:40.652
To break it down Barney style,

13:40.721 --> 13:44.192
molten fire will rain
down on every continent.

13:44.261 --> 13:46.062
It'll be followed
by a nuclear winter

13:46.131 --> 13:48.598
and all life on
earth will perish.

13:55.938 --> 13:57.272
What was that?

13:57.341 --> 14:00.908
That's one of our
random phenomenon here,

14:00.977 --> 14:02.816
random explosions.

14:02.885 --> 14:04.380
Yet without the typical
acrid smell

14:04.448 --> 14:06.481
that accompanies bombs
and incendiary weapons.

14:06.550 --> 14:09.089
We brought on a team from
the 71st Ordnance Group EOD

14:09.157 --> 14:11.819
to investigate, but so far
they've turned up nothing.

14:11.888 --> 14:13.452
You know what?

14:13.521 --> 14:15.588
I should take
an initial reading here.

14:23.070 --> 14:25.802
Okay, there are inordinately
high levels

14:25.871 --> 14:28.975
of ambient sulfur dioxide.

14:29.044 --> 14:30.070
It's being violently pushed
to the surface

14:30.138 --> 14:31.837
by the volcanic pressure.

14:31.906 --> 14:34.443
That's most likely what's caused
the unexplained explosions.

14:34.512 --> 14:36.713
Right, but would that cause
the levels of destruction

14:36.782 --> 14:38.082
we've been experiencing?

14:38.151 --> 14:40.283
With readings like this,
absolutely, Major.

14:40.351 --> 14:42.822
I mean, those gases
could literally vaporize

14:42.890 --> 14:44.451
anything they come
in contact with.

14:44.520 --> 14:46.951
General Norris
set a 12-hour window?

14:47.020 --> 14:48.688
If that.

14:48.756 --> 14:52.593
But how many hours,
I can't say at this point.

14:52.662 --> 14:54.761
I'm gonna need to run more
tests at the actual site.

14:54.830 --> 14:58.499
And I need to locate the actual
epicenter of this disturbance.

15:00.003 --> 15:01.469
Think you can stop it?

15:02.803 --> 15:05.639
That last tremor felt
to me like magnitude six.

15:05.708 --> 15:08.606
And they're just going to
get more intense with time.

15:08.675 --> 15:13.118
And based on the readings
I just took,

15:13.187 --> 15:15.254
we're too far along
in the process to attempt

15:15.322 --> 15:18.157
any depressurization or
aperture venting techniques.

15:18.226 --> 15:23.293
So there's only one sure option
I can think of.

15:23.362 --> 15:25.326
How much ordnance can
you get on short notice?

15:25.395 --> 15:26.926
I'll get you whatever
you need, ma'am.

15:26.995 --> 15:28.901
Okay.

15:28.970 --> 15:30.730
I need to locate
the epicenter first.

15:30.798 --> 15:34.607
Now we have a general
vicinity from Cal-Tech,

15:34.676 --> 15:36.401
this lake Lago Do Fodo.

15:36.470 --> 15:38.244
But it's my company that has

15:38.312 --> 15:41.214
the best geothermal targeting
software in the world.

15:41.283 --> 15:44.349
And given that we're using
explosives on a grand scale,

15:44.418 --> 15:47.153
I'm gonna need to get as close
to the drop zone as possible,

15:47.222 --> 15:50.216
so that I can get a visual
reference on the actual

15:50.285 --> 15:51.818
location of the epicenter.

15:51.886 --> 15:53.821
We cannot afford to be off
by even as much as two meters.

15:53.890 --> 15:55.325
Copy.

15:55.394 --> 15:56.960
Let me grab my man
from EOD to provide you

15:57.029 --> 15:58.392
safe escort to Lago Do Fodo

15:58.461 --> 16:00.233
and if you
wouldn't mind standing

16:00.301 --> 16:02.398
in the command bunker over there
to wait, it'll be safe.

16:02.467 --> 16:04.867
Of course, Major,
but time is of the essence.

16:04.936 --> 16:06.167
Right away, ma'am.

16:06.236 --> 16:07.668
Based on what I've seen so far,

16:07.736 --> 16:09.337
I'm beginning to think
that we have a lot less

16:09.406 --> 16:10.971
than 12 hours
before the eruption.

16:11.040 --> 16:12.276
Copy that, ma'am.

16:31.731 --> 16:32.961
We getting close?

16:33.030 --> 16:34.298
Approaching now, doctor.

17:08.097 --> 17:09.731
Hey, Major?

17:09.800 --> 17:12.166
How's your knowledge of recent
history in this part of Brazil?

17:12.235 --> 17:14.537
-Proficient.
-Okay.

17:14.606 --> 17:16.041
Well, volcanoes have
been extinct in this country

17:16.109 --> 17:18.310
for a very, very,
very long time.

17:18.379 --> 17:20.873
Now I know that industry
has decimated the rain forest,

17:20.942 --> 17:24.477
but is there fracking or
any other seismic explorations

17:24.546 --> 17:25.717
that you're aware
of in this part?

17:25.786 --> 17:27.419
Not that I know of.

17:27.488 --> 17:29.618
There have been reports of
large demolitions being used

17:29.687 --> 17:32.285
to clear foliage for
the pipelines out of Sergipe.

17:32.354 --> 17:33.591
Okay, that's good to know.

17:35.429 --> 17:38.163
All right. I'm getting extremely
high levels of C02.

17:38.232 --> 17:40.329
Now when C02 is detected
at the surface,

17:40.398 --> 17:42.130
it means that new magma
is running

17:42.198 --> 17:43.832
into the volcanic system,

17:43.901 --> 17:46.601
even though there isn't supposed
to be a volcanic system here.

17:46.670 --> 17:49.374
Also, exorbitant levels
of sulfur dioxide,

17:49.443 --> 17:52.338
which indicates that the
magma is close to the surface

17:52.406 --> 17:54.138
and eruption is definite.

17:54.207 --> 17:58.109
If these levels were any higher,
we wouldn't be able to breathe.

17:58.178 --> 18:02.083
Also, judging by the intensity
and the increasing intensity

18:02.152 --> 18:03.686
of the earthquakes,

18:03.754 --> 18:08.722
I would say that we are
well past the 12-hour mark.

18:08.790 --> 18:10.722
Eruption's gonna happen
in a few hours.

18:10.791 --> 18:14.900
Now I can confirm
all the information

18:14.969 --> 18:16.634
in General Norris's report.

18:16.703 --> 18:21.273
This is the source of all of the
disturbances, this lake here.

18:21.342 --> 18:25.377
But without being able
to visually see the epicenter,

18:25.446 --> 18:28.909
I'm gonna need to link up
with my company's satellite

18:28.977 --> 18:32.449
and get an infrared image below
the surface of the water

18:32.518 --> 18:35.046
so that we can pinpoint
the exact location

18:35.115 --> 18:37.850
of the fissure if we have
any hope of stopping this.

18:45.096 --> 18:46.397
This shouldn't take long.

18:58.846 --> 19:00.213
What's the matter?

19:05.019 --> 19:06.615
I've lost the satellite link.

19:06.683 --> 19:08.153
I need that satellite link
if we're gonna

19:08.221 --> 19:10.118
find the location
of the fissure!

19:10.187 --> 19:11.787
I have to have it!

19:11.856 --> 19:14.091
We can do a hard patch through
our server back at Foxtrot.

19:14.160 --> 19:16.995
Okay.
Let's do that.

19:17.064 --> 19:18.059
Let's Oscar Mike, Lieutenant.

19:18.127 --> 19:20.799
Copy, sir.

19:20.868 --> 19:21.865
What is it, doctor?

19:21.934 --> 19:23.535
This fungus.

19:23.604 --> 19:25.702
I'm practically an expert of
flora around volcanic sites.

19:25.771 --> 19:28.270
And I've never seen anything
like this before in my life.

19:28.339 --> 19:30.473
When's your mycologist get here?

19:30.542 --> 19:32.879
They should have been
here an hour ago.

19:32.948 --> 19:33.876
All right, let's get going.

19:33.945 --> 19:34.980
Okay.

19:35.049 --> 19:35.977
Lieutenant, let's Oscar Mike.

19:36.046 --> 19:37.547
Yes, sir!

20:01.637 --> 20:02.974
You got enough room?
You good?

20:03.042 --> 20:04.209
-Yes.
-Sorry.

20:04.277 --> 20:05.774
Did they say what
the holdup was?

20:05.843 --> 20:07.178
Yeah. There was another storm
between the airfield

20:07.247 --> 20:08.544
-and the destination.
-Oh.

20:08.613 --> 20:09.975
Why didn't they just
circumnavigate it?

20:10.044 --> 20:11.847
Because I didn't want to
risk taking us through

20:11.916 --> 20:13.448
rebel-controlled territory,
get shot at and kidnapped.

20:13.516 --> 20:15.347
Right.
Let's not do that.

20:15.416 --> 20:17.690
Yeah, please?

20:17.758 --> 20:18.690
Go Brazil.

20:20.259 --> 20:22.559
Whoa!
Look at that!

20:26.865 --> 20:28.529
I have never seen lightning
like that before in my life!

20:28.597 --> 20:30.630
Oh, God!
I hope Onyx is okay.

20:30.699 --> 20:34.671
-Who's Onyx?
-Oh, he's my pup.

20:34.740 --> 20:37.002
He's tough, but he does
not like thunderstorms.

20:37.071 --> 20:39.245
And I had to leave him
with my ex-girlfriend.

20:39.314 --> 20:41.112
I hate doing that.
I hate doing that.

20:41.181 --> 20:44.749
-Oh. I'm sorry.
-Thanks.

20:44.818 --> 20:47.111
So is he.

20:47.180 --> 20:49.348
Poor boy's probably
behind a couch shaking.

20:49.417 --> 20:51.654
Oh, I hate that.

20:57.158 --> 20:59.693
How many times are you gonna
read through that thing?

20:59.762 --> 21:01.631
-I'm a slow reader.
-I'm sorry.

21:04.366 --> 21:05.833
God, it is hot.

21:07.801 --> 21:09.502
It's 40 degrees Celsius outside.

21:09.570 --> 21:11.003
You know the crazy thing?

21:11.072 --> 21:13.071
10 minutes ago,
I would've sworn I was cold.

21:13.140 --> 21:15.410
I mean, look at this.
We're kicking up dust.

21:15.479 --> 21:16.743
The air is drier than hell.

21:16.811 --> 21:17.981
I don't understand
what's going on.

21:18.050 --> 21:20.716
Whoa! Whoa!

21:22.753 --> 21:26.524
That was an earthquake...
in the Amazon.

21:26.592 --> 21:28.361
Hey, just get us safe
there, buddy, huh?

21:28.429 --> 21:31.096
You're doing a good job.
Everything's great.

21:31.165 --> 21:32.094
Everybody's doing a good job.

21:32.163 --> 21:33.465
Look at that!

21:36.396 --> 21:41.403
Look at the trees, complete
absence of moss or lichens.

21:41.472 --> 21:42.969
These things should be covered!

21:43.037 --> 21:46.443
I mean, but a catastrophic
climate shift

21:46.512 --> 21:50.076
would dry out
all the tree trunks.

21:50.144 --> 21:52.184
But this is the rainforest,
it's not a desert.

21:52.253 --> 21:53.684
Exactly.
That's what I'm saying.

21:53.752 --> 21:55.287
Maybe it's accelerated
warming at ground level

21:55.356 --> 21:57.786
due to the extreme
weather cycles?

21:57.854 --> 22:00.788
Which would suggest that
the weather patterns

22:00.857 --> 22:04.555
are subject to
the volcanic activity?

22:04.624 --> 22:06.091
Yeah, absolutely.

22:06.160 --> 22:08.368
I mean, that is why
I'm here to figure out.

22:12.907 --> 22:13.967
What was that?

22:16.109 --> 22:17.542
It looked like a locust.

22:19.644 --> 22:21.911
Locusts go where
the climate's drying out.

22:21.980 --> 22:25.143
Yeah, but this place isn't gonna
be drying out anytime soon.

22:26.847 --> 22:29.114
Look!
Look, look, look!

22:32.125 --> 22:35.391
Oh, right... whoa.

22:35.460 --> 22:38.562
Yeah, before that gets here,

22:38.631 --> 22:40.126
we should stop and
take a quick look.

22:40.194 --> 22:41.430
See if we can't figure out
what's happened here

22:41.499 --> 22:42.630
in the last couple of hours.

22:42.699 --> 22:43.729
You think that's
gonna be safe?

22:43.798 --> 22:45.504
We'll stay close to the road.

22:47.572 --> 22:49.069
-Okay. Let's do that.
-Yeah?

22:49.138 --> 22:50.770
All right. Hey, can you find
a good spot to pull over?

22:50.838 --> 22:52.537
We wanna get out
and take a look.

22:52.605 --> 22:54.447
Thank you.

22:58.582 --> 23:00.717
-Let's hustle out.
-Okay.

23:02.186 --> 23:03.753
Okay.

23:21.302 --> 23:23.974
Soldiers! This is Major Oakley
Jones, United States Army!

23:24.043 --> 23:25.136
Major!

23:25.205 --> 23:27.841
Corporal Kyle Tremblay,
Canadian Army!

23:27.910 --> 23:29.676
We're getting vermin out
of the area

23:29.745 --> 23:31.409
and securing the jungle, sir!

23:31.478 --> 23:35.185
Corporal, we're under explicit
orders for nonlethal engagement!

23:35.254 --> 23:36.853
Not anymore, Major!

23:36.922 --> 23:38.685
We're getting fired on
and we're gonna fire back!

23:38.754 --> 23:40.485
No more half measures, sir!

23:40.554 --> 23:43.662
Corporal, you're in violation
of the United Nations SROE!

23:43.731 --> 23:47.260
Cease fire and fall back on
my position immediately!

23:47.329 --> 23:48.868
Ahh!

23:48.936 --> 23:49.896
I got him!

23:49.964 --> 23:52.632
Did you see that, Major?
I got him!

23:52.701 --> 23:54.440
Let him go, Lieutenant.

23:54.509 --> 23:56.369
Security for Dr. Hughes
is our priority.

23:56.438 --> 23:58.104
Yes, sir.

24:01.608 --> 24:03.178
Doctor!

24:03.247 --> 24:04.642
Wait.

24:04.711 --> 24:06.085
Someone is hurt.

24:06.153 --> 24:08.953
Okay, but stay behind me.

24:09.022 --> 24:11.557
Yes, sir.

24:43.190 --> 24:44.585
Yes, I speak English.

24:44.653 --> 24:46.485
What's your name, son?

24:46.554 --> 24:48.188
Paulo.

24:48.257 --> 24:50.925
I'm Major Oakley Jones
with the United States Army.

24:50.994 --> 24:52.696
We're gonna get you some
help, okay, Paulo?

24:52.765 --> 24:57.401
There's no help anymore...
for anyone.

24:57.470 --> 24:58.632
Okay, Paulo.
Hang on...

24:58.700 --> 25:00.734
You don't understand.

25:00.803 --> 25:04.705
Everyone is killing everyone.

25:04.774 --> 25:07.980
There's something... wrong.

25:08.048 --> 25:10.542
It's evil.

25:33.769 --> 25:35.433
Foxtrot Command Scavenger.

25:35.502 --> 25:39.574
Request Medevac on my
immediate location... 1CI.

25:39.642 --> 25:41.108
Foxtrot, how do you read?

25:41.177 --> 25:43.010
Major, we've gotta get moving.
We gotta go fast.

25:43.079 --> 25:44.782
We don't want
to get stuck in that.

25:44.851 --> 25:45.843
Okay. We're gonna have
to handle this ourselves.

25:45.912 --> 25:47.347
Let's get him loaded up.

25:47.416 --> 25:49.182
Major...

25:53.687 --> 25:55.056
I never...

25:57.631 --> 26:03.636
I was just trying
to protect my crops.

26:06.967 --> 26:08.837
That was the Fifth Seal...

26:08.906 --> 26:11.006
those who are martyred
for their faith.

26:15.710 --> 26:17.381
Sergeant Wayne!

26:17.450 --> 26:20.311
Sir, we gotta get out of here.

26:20.380 --> 26:24.283
Okay, let's go.
Let's go, Sergeant.

26:50.711 --> 26:52.080
Look out!

27:00.156 --> 27:02.760
You guys better
get to higher ground.

27:02.829 --> 27:04.224
I have to get out of here.
Good luck.

27:10.237 --> 27:11.671
Go, go, go, go!

27:25.186 --> 27:26.950
Ah, thank you.

27:45.402 --> 27:46.970
Wow!

27:51.775 --> 27:54.179
-You okay?
-Yeah.

27:54.248 --> 27:55.308
Oh, that's...

28:06.086 --> 28:07.419
Well...
Well...

28:11.029 --> 28:12.864
Looks like
we're gonna be here a bit.

28:32.852 --> 28:34.314
No disrespect, Major,
you really think

28:34.382 --> 28:36.481
this has something
to do with the Bible?

28:38.457 --> 28:40.958
I do. That I do.

28:42.857 --> 28:44.224
Time will tell.

28:44.293 --> 28:46.530
Lt's just hope
preventing the Apocalypse

28:46.599 --> 28:48.331
is all part of God's plan.

28:48.400 --> 28:50.066
Amen.

28:55.969 --> 28:57.573
Is that smoke?

28:57.642 --> 28:59.509
Something's wrong.

28:59.578 --> 29:00.846
Where is everybody?

29:02.446 --> 29:04.579
Man, that storm really put
an ass whooping on us, sir.

29:04.648 --> 29:07.252
Sure did, Sarge.

29:07.321 --> 29:08.679
Make a sweep.

29:08.748 --> 29:11.090
The other scientists should
have been here by now.

29:11.159 --> 29:12.284
Yes, sir.

29:12.353 --> 29:15.089
Where do you think
everyone went?

29:15.158 --> 29:17.061
Don't know. No signs of
firefight.

29:17.129 --> 29:19.359
There are no shell casings
or small weapons damage.

29:19.428 --> 29:21.995
Would they have fled
because of the storm?

29:22.064 --> 29:23.495
No signs of rapid departure.

29:23.563 --> 29:25.535
Conditions are bad,
but they'd be better off

29:25.604 --> 29:27.037
just hunkering down.

29:36.281 --> 29:40.485
Major, we need to reestablish
that satellite link now.

29:40.554 --> 29:42.253
Okay, but just hold on.

29:42.322 --> 29:44.186
As soon as the base is cleared,
we'll get the power running.

29:54.035 --> 29:56.032
Sir, it looks like the lightning
took out our generators,

29:56.101 --> 29:58.930
So we've got no power?
Can we fix it?

29:58.999 --> 30:00.634
Not fast enough.

30:00.703 --> 30:02.374
There's a radio station a few
klicks from here we can try.

30:02.443 --> 30:03.667
If it's not damaged,

30:03.736 --> 30:05.742
we can get you linked up
to the satellite there.

30:05.811 --> 30:07.271
Then what are we waiting for?

30:07.340 --> 30:09.409
All right, let's Oscar Mike.

30:29.536 --> 30:30.797
So what's the plan?

30:30.866 --> 30:33.171
I don't know.

30:33.240 --> 30:35.799
We were going that way, but the
road disappears into the trees.

30:35.868 --> 30:38.944
If it takes a bend, there's
a fork in the road...

30:41.113 --> 30:43.080
I think we need to signal
for help somehow.

30:48.753 --> 30:50.282
Do you have any matches?

30:50.351 --> 30:52.591
Or a lighter?
Or anything?

30:52.660 --> 30:54.818
I have some hygroscopic flares.

30:54.887 --> 30:57.092
I was gonna do some cloud
seeding for the fires. Why?

30:57.161 --> 31:00.499
Yeah, yeah, that'll work.
Let me have one.

31:00.567 --> 31:01.765
What are you thinking?

31:01.834 --> 31:03.462
I'm thinking I start a fire

31:03.531 --> 31:06.068
and try the old smoke
signal routine.

31:06.137 --> 31:07.770
Do you think
that's a good idea?

31:07.838 --> 31:09.335
Do you have a better one?

31:09.404 --> 31:10.976
Look, with the timeframe
that we're on,

31:11.044 --> 31:12.737
we can't afford
for help to come to us.

31:12.805 --> 31:15.078
We need to get back to the
rest of the group, ASAP.

31:15.147 --> 31:18.378
Yeah, that...
Okay, that makes sense.

31:18.447 --> 31:20.247
Look, I've done it
a couple of times.

31:20.316 --> 31:22.221
I was in the Boy Scouts.
It'll be fine.

31:22.290 --> 31:23.582
Here.

31:30.992 --> 31:32.025
Be careful.

31:32.094 --> 31:34.092
Get Scavenger on the line.

31:34.161 --> 31:36.265
Right away, ma'am.

31:37.331 --> 31:38.997
-Scavenger. Zeus.

31:39.066 --> 31:40.372
How do you read?

31:40.440 --> 31:41.433
Scavenger!

31:41.502 --> 31:43.804
Would somebody fix
these damn comms?

31:43.873 --> 31:45.274
Yes, Aidan.

31:45.343 --> 31:47.912
We've lost communication
with Foxtrot Command.

31:47.981 --> 31:49.476
Looks like the problem
is on their end,

31:49.544 --> 31:51.248
and not necessarily
from storm interference.

31:51.316 --> 31:54.218
We did receive confirmation
that Doctor Rodney

31:54.287 --> 31:56.253
and Doctor Lenna landed
safely at the airfield.

31:56.321 --> 31:58.820
But then we lost communication
with their transport

31:58.889 --> 32:00.218
enroute to Foxtrot.

32:00.286 --> 32:01.553
Contact the 4th Fleet.

32:01.622 --> 32:03.459
I want to err on the
side of caution

32:03.528 --> 32:05.229
that possibly they could have
had a vehicle breakdown

32:05.298 --> 32:08.559
or worse, could have
encountered rebel resistance.

32:08.628 --> 32:10.728
I want a pararescue
team deployed

32:10.796 --> 32:12.162
to their last known location
immediately.

32:12.231 --> 32:13.566
Yes, General.

32:44.605 --> 32:46.731
Yes, yes, yes, yes!

32:51.841 --> 32:53.309
No...

33:08.688 --> 33:11.525
Wait a minute.
Are those smoke signals?

33:12.898 --> 33:14.693
-- 00!
-I see it.

33:20.001 --> 33:21.469
Look out!

33:22.536 --> 33:24.604
-Hold tight!

33:27.774 --> 33:30.046
Elliot! Elliot!
I think I see a car!

33:30.114 --> 33:31.577
-Hey! Hey!
-Dakota, wait!

33:31.646 --> 33:33.819
Is that one of
your scientists up there?

33:33.888 --> 33:35.151
I don't know who
else it could be.

33:35.220 --> 33:37.287
No civilians out
this deep in the bush.

33:38.685 --> 33:40.924
No, no, no!
Dakota, it's not safe!

33:40.993 --> 33:42.325
We don't know who they are!

33:43.926 --> 33:45.163
Dakota!

33:53.673 --> 33:54.940
Dr. Dakota Lenna?

33:55.009 --> 33:56.868
-Yes. Major Jones?
-Affirmative.

33:56.937 --> 33:58.802
Do you know the whereabouts
of Dr. Elliot Rodney?

33:58.871 --> 34:02.481
Yes. He's the one making
the smoke signals.

34:02.550 --> 34:03.440
There he is!

34:03.509 --> 34:05.781
-Ah!

34:05.850 --> 34:07.317
What the...

34:10.756 --> 34:13.488
Come on!
Come on!

34:14.253 --> 34:15.556
Dakota!

34:19.500 --> 34:20.863
Get in!

34:20.931 --> 34:23.162
Let's go, guys.

34:23.231 --> 34:24.595
Dr. Elliot Rodney?

34:24.663 --> 34:28.270
That's me!
Nice to meet you.

34:28.338 --> 34:29.639
Come on! Come on! Come on!
Come on!

34:29.708 --> 34:30.802
Let's go.

34:36.615 --> 34:38.381
Come on!

34:46.925 --> 34:48.125
Are those locusts?

34:48.194 --> 34:51.130
Yes!
There's a lot of them, too!

34:53.700 --> 34:54.692
Come on, come on!

34:54.761 --> 34:55.966
Doesn't this thing
go any faster?

34:56.035 --> 34:57.433
Going as fast as I can, doctor!

35:00.239 --> 35:02.407
Major, how good of
a shot are you?

35:02.476 --> 35:05.943
Did three tours in Afghanistan
as a forward recon sniper. Why?

35:06.012 --> 35:07.740
Yeah?
That'll do it.

35:13.050 --> 35:14.786
Metharizium acridum!

35:14.855 --> 35:16.451
What, is that like a bug bomb?

35:16.520 --> 35:18.288
Kinda, it's a
fungal-oil based compound

35:18.357 --> 35:21.293
that disrupts
their oxygen exchange.

35:21.362 --> 35:23.058
Basically kills them without
killing everything else.

35:23.127 --> 35:24.491
Oh, God, that's so clever.

35:24.560 --> 35:25.890
It wouldn't destroy
all of the birds,

35:25.958 --> 35:27.357
and it wouldn't kill off
their food chain supply.

35:27.426 --> 35:28.727
Exactly, exactly.

35:28.796 --> 35:30.597
The fungus attaches to
the exoskeleton

35:30.666 --> 35:32.504
and disrupts their exchange
of oxygen,

35:32.573 --> 35:36.905
causing organic death without
spreading to other species.

35:36.974 --> 35:38.408
Do you spray it?

35:38.477 --> 35:39.838
No, I usually do a
controlled burn in the fields.

35:39.906 --> 35:42.245
But the canister itself
is pressurized.

35:42.314 --> 35:43.576
If the major puts
a bullet through it,

35:43.645 --> 35:46.116
it should explode
dispensing a cloud

35:46.184 --> 35:49.551
-It's worth a shot.
-Genius.

35:51.190 --> 35:53.357
-Yeah?
-Okay, let's do it.

35:53.426 --> 35:55.225
Cover your ears.
This gunshot's gonna be loud.

35:55.294 --> 35:57.592
On your count, Major!
On your command!

36:01.297 --> 36:03.268
-Ah!
-I got you!

36:04.803 --> 36:05.529
Thank you.

36:05.597 --> 36:08.570
-Major!
-Hold!

36:14.009 --> 36:16.273
Now!

36:19.015 --> 36:20.982
Nice shot!

36:25.188 --> 36:26.885
Nice shooting, Major.

36:33.233 --> 36:34.829
What happened
to your transport?

36:34.898 --> 36:38.533
We stopped to do some tests
and there was a flash flood.

36:38.602 --> 36:40.965
It took it and our driver
away with it.

36:43.102 --> 36:45.572
Hey, I didn't get your
guys' names, by the way.

36:45.640 --> 36:47.604
Apologies.
Major Oakley Jones.

36:47.673 --> 36:49.446
This is Sergeant Shockley,

36:49.515 --> 36:51.509
Lieutenant Rohrbacher,
United States Army.

36:51.577 --> 36:53.317
Nice to meet you guys.

36:53.386 --> 36:54.714
Thanks for saving
our asses back there.

36:54.783 --> 36:56.985
Pleasure to meet you,
Elliot Rodney.

36:57.054 --> 36:58.488
Dakota Lenna.

36:58.557 --> 37:00.656
Lynise Hughes.
Glad to make your acquaintances,

37:00.725 --> 37:03.562
albeit I wish it was
under better circumstances.

37:03.631 --> 37:05.730
Hell, maybe can all go for a
beer after this is over, huh?

37:05.798 --> 37:07.063
I hope so.

37:07.132 --> 37:10.533
Major, where are we going?

37:10.602 --> 37:12.899
Radio tower.
Comms were down back at base.

37:12.968 --> 37:14.969
Dr. Hughes needs to patch
into her satellite network.

37:15.038 --> 37:16.706
Yeah.

37:16.775 --> 37:19.509
I'm confident that I've located
the epicenter for the eruption.

37:19.578 --> 37:22.544
But now I need to
pinpoint an exact location.

37:22.613 --> 37:24.747
What is your proposed
plan of action?

37:24.816 --> 37:25.976
Bomb it.

37:26.045 --> 37:28.117
Seriously?
In the middle of the Amazon?

37:28.186 --> 37:29.518
Well, we don't have much time.

37:29.587 --> 37:31.149
And we're too far along in
the process

37:31.218 --> 37:33.686
to attempt depressurization or
aperture venting techniques.

37:33.755 --> 37:35.393
So this is the only
chance we have

37:35.462 --> 37:37.396
of stopping it from destroying
the entire world.

37:37.464 --> 37:40.294
That's why I need
to determine the exact location

37:40.362 --> 37:42.501
and the exact drop point.

37:42.569 --> 37:45.668
Also, at the rate these
earthquakes are escalating,

37:45.737 --> 37:48.538
my guess is this eruption
is coming sooner, not later.

37:48.606 --> 37:50.639
I need to get the SAT link
up and running

37:50.708 --> 37:52.569
so that I can determine
the exact timeframe

37:52.638 --> 37:54.342
before the eruption.

37:54.411 --> 37:56.009
Oh, Elliot, I meant to ask you.

37:56.078 --> 37:57.808
I saw a fungus at the site
that did not look familiar.

37:57.877 --> 37:59.616
Orange palette?
Black spots?

37:59.685 --> 38:00.851
-Kinda looks like carrots?
-Yeah! So you've seen it?

38:00.920 --> 38:02.146
Yes, indeed.

38:02.214 --> 38:03.584
I have a sample of it
with me here in my bag.

38:03.652 --> 38:04.615
As soon as we get
to the station,

38:04.683 --> 38:05.983
I'll set up a field test.

38:06.052 --> 38:07.723
to determine whether or
not it's related

38:07.791 --> 38:08.858
to the geothermal activity
we've been experiencing.

38:08.927 --> 38:09.720
Great.

38:09.789 --> 38:11.055
Whoo, this is up here, huh?

38:12.494 --> 38:13.658
What about you, Dr. Lenna?

38:13.727 --> 38:15.125
In my professional opinion,

38:15.194 --> 38:17.166
these are clearly
unpredictable weather cycles,

38:17.234 --> 38:18.700
but it's not distinct.

38:18.768 --> 38:21.402
It's definitely
the geothermal-related,

38:21.471 --> 38:22.701
based upon all of your tests.

38:22.770 --> 38:25.638
But these erratic weather
patterns

38:25.707 --> 38:27.609
are definitely coming
from all

38:27.678 --> 38:31.416
of these potential
volcanic eruptions.

38:31.484 --> 38:33.678
And it's coming from
this immediate area.

38:33.747 --> 38:35.645
How much farther, Sergeant?

38:35.714 --> 38:37.114
Almost there, ma'am.

38:43.696 --> 38:46.824
Okay, we're gonna need to
pull over here and go on foot.

38:46.892 --> 38:48.697
If there are any
rebel hold outs,

38:48.766 --> 38:50.732
we can't run the risk of
them hearing our vehicle.

39:07.349 --> 39:08.783
Stay alert.

39:24.233 --> 39:26.904
This way.

39:27.833 --> 39:29.106
Wait. Does anyone else hear...

39:29.175 --> 39:30.772
Stay close and stay quiet.

39:55.335 --> 39:57.464
-You okay, Sergeant?
-Yes, sir.

39:57.532 --> 39:59.064
A headache coming on.

40:04.008 --> 40:06.911
Stay behind us. There's been
rebel activity in this area.

40:06.979 --> 40:08.040
Copy that.

40:10.844 --> 40:12.310
This is never going to work.

40:12.379 --> 40:13.445
Why not?

40:13.514 --> 40:14.849
Just look at it.

40:19.919 --> 40:21.592
Once we know the area is secure,

40:21.660 --> 40:23.124
I'll get the radio
tower up and running.

40:23.193 --> 40:24.161
Good.

40:24.230 --> 40:25.928
After we locate the epicenter,

40:25.997 --> 40:28.293
it's just a matter of collapsing
the volcano's magma chamber.

40:28.362 --> 40:30.463
The Pentagon should be
able to provide enough ordnance

40:30.532 --> 40:32.032
to get the job done.

40:32.100 --> 40:34.337
If we're successful,
the cataclysmic weather events

40:34.406 --> 40:36.541
should dissipate worldwide.

40:36.609 --> 40:38.842
Assuming all of our
findings are sound.

40:38.910 --> 40:41.777
Correct. Bottom line,
it's the best chance we have.

40:57.931 --> 40:59.295
Clear!

40:59.363 --> 41:00.697
Lead us in, Sergeant.

41:35.497 --> 41:38.100
Hold, hold...

41:38.169 --> 41:39.736
Move out.

41:42.140 --> 41:43.674
Follow me.

42:04.661 --> 42:06.257
Sergeant, on the perimeter!

42:25.213 --> 42:27.619
Shockley! On the perimeter!
Now, soldier!

42:28.915 --> 42:31.154
I need that sat link ASAP!

42:33.789 --> 42:35.053
I can't get a clear channel.

42:35.122 --> 42:37.794
-Well, keep trying.
-I am trying!

42:42.401 --> 42:43.800
If today I lose my hope, Lord,

42:43.868 --> 42:46.165
please remind me
that Your plans are greater.

42:50.674 --> 42:51.905
Hey, that storm is coming in.

42:51.974 --> 42:53.676
We better have good
radios, otherwise

42:53.745 --> 42:55.778
on the tower
there won't be a signal.

42:55.847 --> 42:59.580
In a building this old?
Yeah, sure.

42:59.648 --> 43:01.083
How's it going, major?

43:04.391 --> 43:07.054
How's it going?
Major!

43:07.122 --> 43:09.324
I think the issue's
on the tower itself.

43:09.393 --> 43:10.794
Lieutenant!

43:18.001 --> 43:20.465
I'm gonna go examine
my funky specimens.

43:20.534 --> 43:24.071
But I need to do that away
from everybody, just in case.

43:25.205 --> 43:27.077
I'll be back
when I have something.

43:27.146 --> 43:30.107
Okay.

43:30.175 --> 43:33.344
Sergeant Shockley?
Sergeant!

43:34.720 --> 43:36.818
He's not our priority right now.
That is!

43:36.887 --> 43:38.855
Come on.
Let's find the access ladder.

43:41.125 --> 43:43.893
Look, I need to know the
exact epicenter of the volcano

43:43.961 --> 43:45.763
so I know how much
ordnance that we need.

43:45.831 --> 43:47.725
And I cannot do that
without a sat link.

43:47.794 --> 43:49.195
Right, okay.

44:13.355 --> 44:15.925
You, um, you said you had taken
some tests earlier.

44:15.994 --> 44:18.088
Can you share some of
that information with me?

44:18.157 --> 44:19.562
-Oh, yeah.
-Oh, great.

44:19.631 --> 44:21.291
So. This was taken earlier.

44:21.360 --> 44:22.898
Obviously, it's not
a livestream

44:22.967 --> 44:24.329
because we don't have
satellite access,

44:24.397 --> 44:27.503
but you see all these
clouds dispersing?

44:27.571 --> 44:29.365
So they all disperse,

44:29.434 --> 44:31.105
and then they
come back together,

44:31.174 --> 44:34.008
which means that there are
all correlated,

44:34.077 --> 44:35.847
they're not independent
from one another.

44:35.915 --> 44:37.443
Yeah, that's great that
you can confirm that.

44:37.512 --> 44:38.882
Exactly.

44:38.951 --> 44:40.084
And you see all these
weather conditions?

44:40.153 --> 44:41.413
Uh-huh.

44:41.481 --> 44:43.816
This is what's causing all
the locust infestations.

44:43.885 --> 44:45.418
-Copy that.
-Yeah.

44:45.486 --> 44:48.925
Okay, so the last piece of
the puzzle is that fungus.

44:48.994 --> 44:50.655
We need to figure out if
that's connected as well.

44:50.724 --> 44:52.495
Right.

44:52.564 --> 44:53.794
I'm gonna check on Elliot.

44:53.863 --> 44:55.394
Shouldn't you put a mask on?

44:55.463 --> 44:58.202
Oh, I'm not gonna go in.
I'm just gonna check on him.

44:58.271 --> 44:58.995
Yeah, yeah, yeah?

44:59.064 --> 45:00.337
-Elliot?
-What?

45:00.406 --> 45:01.766
How's it going in there?

45:01.835 --> 45:03.071
I'm almost done.

45:03.506 --> 45:04.402
Great!

45:11.813 --> 45:14.116
How's it looking, Major?

45:14.185 --> 45:17.987
Yeah, looks like the tower
got hit by lightning.

45:19.122 --> 45:21.221
Just burned out some
circuits and wires.

45:21.290 --> 45:24.796
I'm repairing them...
repairing them now.

45:27.065 --> 45:30.098
Just a few more minutes.
Any sign of the Sergeant?

45:40.745 --> 45:42.341
I'm gonna go check on the Major.

45:44.580 --> 45:46.384
Major?

45:46.452 --> 45:48.316
Major, where are you?

45:48.385 --> 45:50.085
Up here!

45:51.918 --> 45:53.253
I'm coming.

45:57.924 --> 45:59.991
I'm hung up.

46:00.060 --> 46:02.130
-Ah!
-There we go.

46:04.868 --> 46:07.164
-Thank you.
-Of course.

46:07.233 --> 46:08.972
We can't afford to lose you.

46:10.001 --> 46:11.674
How is it?

46:11.743 --> 46:15.206
Just some burned out wires.

46:15.275 --> 46:16.913
-It should work now.
-Great.

46:16.982 --> 46:19.147
-I'll meet you back down there.
-Okay.

46:26.752 --> 46:29.828
-Are my men inside with you?
-No, I haven't seen them.

46:31.124 --> 46:32.424
I'll be in in a second.

46:37.802 --> 46:40.366
Shockley, what are you... whoa!

46:51.844 --> 46:53.544
Ah!

47:13.738 --> 47:15.874
How bad is it, Lieutenant?

47:15.942 --> 47:17.033
He got me in the oblique.
Missed the organs.

47:17.102 --> 47:18.668
I'm okay, sir.

47:18.737 --> 47:19.936
The antenna's working.
You have some paracord on you?

47:20.005 --> 47:21.407
Yes, sir.

47:21.476 --> 47:23.011
Bind Shockley, then
there's a skin stapler

47:23.080 --> 47:24.342
in the first aid kit
in the Jeep.

47:24.411 --> 47:26.379
-Close that wound up.
-Yes, sir.

47:27.981 --> 47:29.718
And be careful.

47:29.786 --> 47:30.918
Shockley's burning up.

47:30.987 --> 47:33.155
Could be malaria... or worse.

47:36.289 --> 47:38.224
Sergeant Shockley became ill.

47:38.293 --> 47:40.123
The Lieutenant's
outside binding him now.

47:40.192 --> 47:42.030
I just put him to sleep.

47:42.099 --> 47:43.528
Anybody starts feeling bad,
speak up.

47:43.597 --> 47:46.570
This is a particularly
bad case of malaria.

47:46.639 --> 47:48.498
Dr. Hughes, what's the status?

47:48.567 --> 47:49.937
I'm working on
establishing a link.

47:50.006 --> 47:51.104
It should be ready in a minute.

47:51.173 --> 47:53.142
Okay.
Let me call the General.

47:54.777 --> 47:55.977
Zeus. Scavenger?

47:56.046 --> 47:59.350
Zeus. Scavenger.
Come in, Zeus.

47:59.419 --> 48:01.548
Zeus. Scavenger.

48:01.617 --> 48:03.614
Zeus, we've been trying to
hail you for some time now.

48:03.683 --> 48:05.752
Foxtrot was just hit bad
by the storms, General,

48:05.821 --> 48:07.217
disabling comms.

48:07.286 --> 48:08.785
We've had to mobilize offsite.

48:08.853 --> 48:10.656
But our guests have
narrowed down the location

48:10.725 --> 48:14.991
of the disturbance and arrived
at a plan on how to proceed.

48:15.060 --> 48:16.529
Go ahead.

48:16.597 --> 48:18.836
The only option we have is
to drop massive ordnance

48:18.904 --> 48:22.238
on the epicenter
and seal the vent.

48:22.307 --> 48:25.340
I'm requesting air assistance
to deliver a GBU-43B

48:25.408 --> 48:29.475
to location coordinates
soon to follow, ma'am.

48:29.543 --> 48:32.381
Understood.
I'll contact the 4th Fleet.

48:32.450 --> 48:35.853
I'll send a Black Hawk and two
Chinooks to evac your team.

48:35.922 --> 48:37.921
One with a GBU-43B
and the other

48:37.990 --> 48:39.720
with a Massive
Ordnance Penetrator.

48:39.788 --> 48:43.724
If one or both of those don't
do the trick, then God help us.

48:43.793 --> 48:45.161
Yes, General.

48:45.230 --> 48:48.025
Confirmation ordnance
request received, ETA...

48:48.094 --> 48:49.394
three hours.

48:49.463 --> 48:51.035
What are your
target coordinates?

48:51.104 --> 48:52.465
I should have them
in a couple of minutes.

48:52.534 --> 48:53.868
It's just everything
is still running slow

48:53.937 --> 48:55.270
because of all the storms.

48:55.338 --> 48:58.971
Stand by for exact
coordinates, General.

48:59.040 --> 49:00.473
Copy. Standing by.

49:04.048 --> 49:05.746
Sergeant Shockley
is secured, sir.

49:05.815 --> 49:07.183
Good, Lieutenant.

49:16.087 --> 49:17.556
General?

49:24.336 --> 49:27.203
Scavenger, we're detecting
a massive storm system

49:27.272 --> 49:30.003
headed straight for your
vicinity, ETA 30 minutes.

49:30.071 --> 49:32.109
Advise you to take cover.

49:32.877 --> 49:34.209
We're inside a solid structure

49:34.278 --> 49:36.645
to ride out any
inclement weather, Zeus.

49:36.713 --> 49:38.849
Copy that.

49:38.918 --> 49:40.617
Do you have those
coordinates yet?

49:40.685 --> 49:42.717
Yes, it's um...

49:53.698 --> 49:54.791
Everybody okay?

49:57.364 --> 49:59.096
That was the worst one yet.

50:08.376 --> 50:10.211
Oh, God!
We lost the connection!

50:10.280 --> 50:12.980
Sounded like the
radio antenna, sir!

50:13.049 --> 50:14.415
Zeus.
Scavenger...

50:16.248 --> 50:17.249
We lost them.

50:17.318 --> 50:19.385
Let's go check out the antenna.

50:19.454 --> 50:22.093
I have to go secure
those samples.

50:52.725 --> 50:54.291
Antenna is wasted.

50:54.360 --> 50:55.620
Crumpled like a tin can
with that last earthquake.

50:55.689 --> 50:56.989
No, Major.
I need the satellite link!

50:57.058 --> 50:58.693
I understand!

50:58.762 --> 51:00.694
Look, there's an abandoned
airfield north of Lago Do Fodo.

51:00.763 --> 51:02.999
We can try to link up there,
but it was rebel-controlled.

51:03.068 --> 51:04.428
Okay.
Well, we have no choice.

51:04.497 --> 51:05.867
How close is it to the lake?

51:05.936 --> 51:07.469
It's right on the water.

51:07.538 --> 51:09.306
Plus, there's old helicopters
and heavy ordnance.

51:09.374 --> 51:11.742
Failsafe if anything
happens to our air assets.

51:11.810 --> 51:13.508
Okay then, let's do that.

51:13.577 --> 51:15.475
At least we'll have some options
if it comes to that.

51:15.544 --> 51:17.213
-Let's go.
-What about the Sergeant, sir?

51:17.282 --> 51:18.774
Escaped.
I found his kit by the antenna.

51:18.843 --> 51:20.111
We'll have to move
on without him.

51:20.180 --> 51:22.186
Elliot, let's go!

51:38.837 --> 51:40.501
Stay low and move quick.

52:15.935 --> 52:17.767
Hey, Elliot, did you get
a chance to learn anything

52:17.835 --> 52:19.373
from the fungus
samples you took?

52:19.441 --> 52:21.538
Oh, yeah, yeah.
More bad news.

52:21.607 --> 52:23.942
As if we need more of that.

52:24.011 --> 52:29.351
Well, this fungi is similar
to a rhodotorula graminis.

52:29.420 --> 52:31.252
That's a fungus
found in volcanoes.

52:31.321 --> 52:33.620
Yes, but unlike that one,
this one

52:33.689 --> 52:35.389
has an additional membrane
which indicates

52:35.458 --> 52:37.492
it originates in water...
likely the lake.

52:37.561 --> 52:40.357
The bad news is that
it's laced with toxins.

52:40.426 --> 52:42.497
So like most fungi,

52:42.566 --> 52:44.160
if the structural integrity
is comprised,

52:44.229 --> 52:46.730
say, for example, if you step
on it, it releases spores.

52:46.799 --> 52:48.565
So as far as
the major's theory goes,

52:48.634 --> 52:50.705
that it's a malaria outbreak,

52:50.773 --> 52:53.970
it's probably actually
this little fungi responsible

52:54.038 --> 52:56.307
for all the symptoms,
the disorientation

52:56.376 --> 52:58.415
and fever and stuff.

52:58.483 --> 53:00.877
Yeah, and also with all storms
and the weather cycles,

53:00.946 --> 53:02.814
the precipitation's most
likely carrying

53:02.883 --> 53:04.180
all the spores into
the upper atmosphere.

53:04.249 --> 53:05.485
Correct.

53:05.554 --> 53:07.216
As far as mitigating
the infection,

53:07.285 --> 53:09.458
a high dose of oxygen should be
enough to suffocate the fungi.

53:13.327 --> 53:15.563
Major! We gotta go!

53:20.173 --> 53:22.669
Everybody!
Get in the truck now!

53:31.913 --> 53:34.447
Looks like our route
is blocked by the wildfire.

53:34.516 --> 53:35.545
We'll be safer closer to
the lake,

53:35.614 --> 53:36.914
but we have to go on foot.

53:48.195 --> 53:49.597
This way.

53:50.697 --> 53:52.831
The lake is only
a few miles ahead.

54:12.551 --> 54:13.750
There's the air base.

54:13.819 --> 54:15.722
Follow this river
bed around to it.

54:20.931 --> 54:23.230
Hey, guys?

54:23.298 --> 54:24.531
I'm gonna catch right up.

54:24.600 --> 54:26.096
I wanna grab a
quick water sample

54:26.164 --> 54:29.070
and verify that the fungus
is indeed from here.

54:29.139 --> 54:30.237
I'll stay with you.

54:30.306 --> 54:31.639
I'll hang back and cover them.

54:32.974 --> 54:37.743
Fungus has to exist in a
relatively low acid environment.

54:37.812 --> 54:39.746
I'm wondering if this
is the place.

54:41.415 --> 54:43.251
Sounds like a plan.

54:43.320 --> 54:44.514
With that added membrane...

54:44.583 --> 54:46.489
I'm pretty sure...

54:50.330 --> 54:52.495
that this is the body
of water it's in.

55:00.100 --> 55:02.800
Let's hold. I don't wanna
separate the group too far.

55:02.869 --> 55:04.374
Major, we're running
out of time.

55:04.443 --> 55:06.175
I can't do anything
without that link.

55:06.244 --> 55:07.842
Under normal circumstances,

55:07.911 --> 55:10.645
the volcanic activity would
make the lake highly acidic.

55:14.986 --> 55:16.112
Water pH is 8.5.

55:16.180 --> 55:18.349
This is definitely
the source of the fungus.

55:18.418 --> 55:20.121
Oh my gosh.

55:20.190 --> 55:21.756
Which makes total sense.

55:21.825 --> 55:23.759
The sediment in the lake
is limestone... it's alkaline.

55:23.828 --> 55:26.931
That's how the massive spores
have been able to survive.

55:26.999 --> 55:28.432
There's zero acidity.

55:31.467 --> 55:33.833
This is it.
We found it.

55:35.536 --> 55:37.034
I wanna collect some more.

55:43.579 --> 55:44.941
You guys, we have
to keep moving.

55:45.009 --> 55:47.210
Yes, yes, of course,
of course.

55:47.279 --> 55:49.685
So, I'm having a thought.
Follow me through on this.

55:49.754 --> 55:53.386
I want to try to combine
the fungus and the acridum,

55:53.455 --> 55:55.358
make kind of a concoction.

55:55.427 --> 55:56.588
And douse my little
friends with it,

55:56.657 --> 55:58.088
essentially infecting them,

55:58.157 --> 56:00.462
then set them loose on
the rest of the swarm.

56:00.530 --> 56:01.997
-That's a great idea.
-Right?

56:02.066 --> 56:03.033
That should work.

56:03.102 --> 56:04.897
Bingo, bango, no more locusts.

56:44.777 --> 56:46.710
General!

56:46.779 --> 56:49.007
We just lost both birds carrying
our payload over the Atlantic!

56:53.145 --> 56:54.743
This road takes us
away from the river,

56:54.812 --> 56:56.185
but it should be faster.

56:56.254 --> 56:57.653
The base is just ahead.

57:02.624 --> 57:04.829
Scavenger! Zeus!
Do you copy?

57:04.897 --> 57:06.196
Scavenger.

57:06.265 --> 57:08.024
We just lost both payloads!

57:08.093 --> 57:10.894
I repeat!
We just lost both payloads!

57:10.963 --> 57:14.036
-No!
-We've lost the payloads?

57:14.105 --> 57:15.971
Affirmative.

57:16.040 --> 57:18.403
We've already dispatched two
Chinooks with similar payloads,

57:18.472 --> 57:19.706
ETA three hours.

57:19.775 --> 57:22.371
We don't have
three hours, Major!

57:22.440 --> 57:24.847
Dr. Hughes, we can't get
that ordnance here any sooner.

57:24.916 --> 57:27.145
It's coming by helicopter off
a carrier out in the Atlantic.

57:27.213 --> 57:30.284
No! That won't do!
We have to do something now!

57:30.352 --> 57:31.986
Zeus, stand by.

57:32.055 --> 57:34.717
You said that that airfield has
helicopters and ordnance, right?

57:34.786 --> 57:36.489
-Yes.
-Okay.

57:36.558 --> 57:38.328
Then we handle this right now!

57:38.397 --> 57:40.796
-Scavenger!
-Zeus. Scavenger.

57:40.865 --> 57:42.993
We're going to explore
possible options on our end.

57:43.062 --> 57:44.665
We'll keep you apprised.
Scavenger out.

57:44.733 --> 57:46.935
Okay, let's go.
And stay low.

58:04.284 --> 58:06.216
Run!

58:16.061 --> 58:17.793
-Hey, you guys okay?
-Yep.

58:17.862 --> 58:19.597
I think we're safe.

58:19.665 --> 58:20.967
That was close.

58:28.046 --> 58:30.745
Hm. There's no guarantee any
of these birds are operational,

58:30.814 --> 58:34.014
but there's a Bell Huey
and a Chinook.

58:34.082 --> 58:36.180
-Great.
-Wait. You can can
fly helicopters?

58:36.248 --> 58:38.283
It won't be a smooth ride,
but we'll manage.

58:38.352 --> 58:40.857
She'll definitely struggle
to gain lift with this heat,

58:40.925 --> 58:43.886
providing I can find ordnance
big enough to do the job.

58:43.955 --> 58:45.793
If we can get that helicopter,

58:45.862 --> 58:47.896
I have some hygroscopic
flares in my bag.

58:47.964 --> 58:50.599
It might temporarily disperse
the warm clouds

58:50.668 --> 58:53.164
and give the helicopter
some lift.

58:53.233 --> 58:56.806
Hey, if I go up, I can
dispense more acridum.

58:56.875 --> 58:58.605
Keep the locust swarms
from choking up the engines

58:58.674 --> 59:00.875
so you guys can carry the bombs!

59:00.944 --> 59:03.640
Check out the Huey.
I'll take the Chinook.

59:03.708 --> 59:05.510
Copy that.

59:05.578 --> 59:07.211
Stay here.

59:07.280 --> 59:09.319
When the Lieutenant gives you
the signal,

59:09.388 --> 59:10.951
Dr. Rodney and Lenna, you move.

59:11.020 --> 59:13.422
Get up in the air,
do what you need to do.

59:13.491 --> 59:15.523
Dr. Hughes, you're with me.

59:15.592 --> 59:16.886
We're gonna take the Chinook.

59:16.955 --> 59:19.190
And do what we need to do.

59:21.693 --> 59:23.326
Good luck.

59:42.614 --> 59:44.351
Come on.

59:44.420 --> 59:45.715
Careful, careful.

59:45.784 --> 59:48.054
Come on, come on.

1:01:24.649 --> 1:01:27.221
That should be enough
firepower to get the job done.

1:01:27.289 --> 1:01:29.953
Okay, I'm gonna use that loader
to get the ordnance

1:01:30.021 --> 1:01:31.019
loaded up on the Chinook.

1:01:31.088 --> 1:01:33.060
Stay put this time.

1:01:41.703 --> 1:01:43.807
Come on, Dakota, come on.

1:01:46.276 --> 1:01:47.305
Come on!

1:01:50.315 --> 1:01:52.211
Dakota, come on!

1:01:53.981 --> 1:01:55.645
We're in!
Go, go, go, go!

1:01:55.714 --> 1:01:56.984
Hang on!

1:01:57.053 --> 1:01:58.749
This is gonna be rough
with these winds!

1:01:58.817 --> 1:02:00.516
Copy that!

1:02:13.733 --> 1:02:15.271
Whoa!

1:02:15.340 --> 1:02:16.703
Very rough, okay?

1:02:16.772 --> 1:02:19.139
Yeah, yeah, yeah, okay.

1:02:33.554 --> 1:02:35.289
Hang on!

1:02:35.358 --> 1:02:37.452
We're gonna go down if we don't
do something about these bugs!

1:02:37.521 --> 1:02:40.095
Ooh, ooh,
I'm gonna try out my concoction!

1:02:40.164 --> 1:02:41.560
-Okay, sounds like a plan!
-I'm gonna try right now!

1:02:41.629 --> 1:02:42.899
Okay.

1:02:44.034 --> 1:02:45.027
When you get a chance,
hold open the door

1:02:45.096 --> 1:02:46.395
so I can drop the flare.

1:02:46.464 --> 1:02:48.201
Yeah. Okay.
Just give me a second.

1:02:51.441 --> 1:02:52.709
Whoa!

1:02:52.778 --> 1:02:54.007
These things are getting
in the turbines!

1:02:54.076 --> 1:02:56.814
No time for this.
Give me your flare!

1:02:58.012 --> 1:02:59.243
Are you gonna put them together

1:02:59.312 --> 1:03:00.649
and kill two birds
with one stone?

1:03:00.718 --> 1:03:02.083
-Yep.
-That's genius.

1:03:02.152 --> 1:03:03.379
It'll clear the skies
with the cloud seed

1:03:03.447 --> 1:03:05.750
and it'll disperse
all the locusts!

1:03:05.819 --> 1:03:06.784
That's the idea.

1:03:06.853 --> 1:03:08.087
Okay, great.

1:03:08.156 --> 1:03:09.185
Wait, how are
we gonna light that?

1:03:09.254 --> 1:03:10.686
Same way as we did last time.

1:03:10.754 --> 1:03:12.995
Yes, but the Lieutenant
is flying the helicopter!

1:03:13.063 --> 1:03:15.395
-How is he gonna shoot?
-Good question.

1:03:15.464 --> 1:03:16.998
Lieutenant, does this thing
have an autopilot function?

1:03:17.067 --> 1:03:20.035
Negative!
This is Vietnam era equipment!

1:03:25.140 --> 1:03:26.608
Okay.
I guess I'll take the shot.

1:03:26.676 --> 1:03:27.942
Do you know how to shoot?

1:03:28.011 --> 1:03:29.179
I used to go plinking
with my dad.

1:03:29.248 --> 1:03:30.607
Okay.

1:03:30.676 --> 1:03:31.844
That was with his .22 and
my BB gun, but that's okay.

1:03:31.912 --> 1:03:33.312
I'm gonna give it a shot.

1:03:33.381 --> 1:03:35.415
Lieutenant, can I use
your rifle, please?

1:03:35.484 --> 1:03:37.019
Take it!

1:03:37.751 --> 1:03:38.685
Okay.

1:03:38.754 --> 1:03:40.685
O-kay! That's a big boy.

1:03:40.754 --> 1:03:42.288
Okay.

1:03:42.356 --> 1:03:44.423
I need advice on how
to shoot a canister

1:03:44.492 --> 1:03:45.955
out a moving helicopter into
a swarm of angry locusts

1:03:46.024 --> 1:03:47.862
and lightning.

1:03:47.931 --> 1:03:48.894
Push the selector
button to "full"

1:03:48.963 --> 1:03:50.428
and make sure you lead it.

1:03:50.497 --> 1:03:52.398
Lead it, okay.
And when you say "lead it",

1:03:52.467 --> 1:03:53.864
you mean with the barrel
in front of the target, right?

1:03:53.933 --> 1:03:55.200
Affirmative!

1:03:55.269 --> 1:03:56.540
On full auto, you wanna
lead it by

1:03:56.609 --> 1:03:58.105
about two feet below to be safe!

1:03:58.174 --> 1:03:59.773
On full auto, the rifle's
gonna tilt up

1:03:59.842 --> 1:04:01.372
when you pull the trigger!

1:04:01.441 --> 1:04:03.107
-Okay, sensible enough.
-Yeah, yeah.

1:04:03.176 --> 1:04:04.779
Okay, here we go.
On three.

1:04:04.848 --> 1:04:08.184
-Okay.
-One, two, three!

1:04:12.389 --> 1:04:13.990
Ah!

1:04:14.787 --> 1:04:16.091
Oh!

1:04:18.125 --> 1:04:20.297
-I did it!
-You did it!

1:04:20.366 --> 1:04:21.932
You did it!

1:04:26.497 --> 1:04:29.372
It's not working.
Oh, it's not...

1:04:29.441 --> 1:04:31.469
It's not working!

1:04:35.443 --> 1:04:37.477
These things are getting
into the turbine engines!

1:04:37.546 --> 1:04:40.412
I'm gonna have to put this
thing down before we crash!

1:04:40.480 --> 1:04:41.746
Go, go, go!
Take it down! Take it down!

1:04:41.815 --> 1:04:43.250
Go, go!

1:04:45.291 --> 1:04:46.924
Whoa!

1:04:51.461 --> 1:04:52.490
Oh!

1:04:57.095 --> 1:04:58.529
Lieutenant!

1:05:09.342 --> 1:05:11.344
-Is everybody okay?
-Yeah.

1:05:12.782 --> 1:05:14.945
What are we gonna do?

1:05:15.014 --> 1:05:16.013
I don't know.

1:05:16.082 --> 1:05:17.415
I don't understand.

1:05:17.484 --> 1:05:19.655
The acridum didn't
kill these things.

1:05:19.724 --> 1:05:22.720
Maybe the Hygroscopic aerosols

1:05:22.788 --> 1:05:25.257
didn't-- dampened the
effectiveness of the acridum?

1:05:25.326 --> 1:05:26.892
Of the acridum!
Yes, that's it!

1:05:26.961 --> 1:05:28.398
Do you have another one?

1:05:28.467 --> 1:05:29.659
I have one more.

1:05:29.727 --> 1:05:33.601
The one that worked
the last time, so...

1:05:33.670 --> 1:05:35.866
Okay, okay.

1:05:35.935 --> 1:05:36.934
Here.

1:05:37.003 --> 1:05:38.438
Lieutenant?

1:05:38.506 --> 1:05:41.405
Lieutenant, you take the shot.
You throw the canister.

1:05:41.474 --> 1:05:43.240
-Okay. Copy.
-I'll open the door.

1:05:43.309 --> 1:05:44.273
-We got this.
-Yeah.

1:05:44.342 --> 1:05:48.183
Ready?
One, two, three!

1:05:57.390 --> 1:06:00.395
It's working?
It's working!

1:06:00.464 --> 1:06:02.494
Hey!

1:06:03.829 --> 1:06:06.394
Major Jones, the locust
swarms have been dispersed.

1:06:06.463 --> 1:06:07.966
You are clear for takeoff.

1:06:08.034 --> 1:06:09.469
Copy, Sergeant.

1:06:09.537 --> 1:06:12.007
Dakota? Elliot? Thank you
for your work up there.

1:06:12.076 --> 1:06:14.638
All right, here we go.
Hold on, Lynise.

1:06:14.706 --> 1:06:16.305
I should be able to connect
to the satellite

1:06:16.374 --> 1:06:17.911
using the Chinook systems.

1:06:17.979 --> 1:06:19.412
I'm getting a signal!

1:06:19.481 --> 1:06:21.513
It's weak, but it's
gonna get the job done!

1:06:25.857 --> 1:06:27.121
Okay, I got the coordinates.

1:06:27.190 --> 1:06:29.324
Go to the north shore
of the lake.

1:06:29.392 --> 1:06:35.392
You're going to 10.7339 Sierra
by 37.5681 Whiskey.

1:06:35.461 --> 1:06:38.398
Copy.
Adjusting accordingly.

1:07:12.804 --> 1:07:14.170
The world is coming to an end.

1:07:18.373 --> 1:07:20.638
Don't count our
team out just yet.

1:07:21.613 --> 1:07:23.311
Yes, ma'am.

1:07:33.417 --> 1:07:35.191
Major, are you all right?

1:07:38.192 --> 1:07:40.061
Major, did you hear me?

1:07:40.130 --> 1:07:42.858
I heard a voice.
Like thunder.

1:07:44.602 --> 1:07:45.762
Major?

1:07:46.936 --> 1:07:48.864
"Come", it cried out.

1:07:55.310 --> 1:07:57.642
Major!
Where are you taking us?

1:07:57.711 --> 1:08:00.777
To Sergipe! We will open
the Seventh Seal, doctor!

1:08:06.050 --> 1:08:09.753
Major! I need you to turn
the helicopter back around!

1:08:16.331 --> 1:08:18.934
I saw before me
a white horse,

1:08:19.003 --> 1:08:21.299
its rider armed with a bow,

1:08:21.368 --> 1:08:23.866
an adorning crown upon his head.

1:08:26.277 --> 1:08:30.543
Behold the second horse...
fiery red!

1:08:31.546 --> 1:08:34.476
Its rider armed
with a mighty sword

1:08:34.545 --> 1:08:36.747
to strike down my enemies.

1:08:40.158 --> 1:08:43.285
Major, I've got
something for you.

1:08:43.354 --> 1:08:44.858
The third horse!

1:08:44.927 --> 1:08:46.293
A black one!

1:08:46.362 --> 1:08:50.364
Its rider baring
the scales of justice...

1:08:50.433 --> 1:08:53.297
Justice and punishment
to my enemies.

1:08:53.365 --> 1:08:56.369
Major, please, take this,

1:08:56.437 --> 1:08:58.538
it's going to make
you feel better.

1:09:00.337 --> 1:09:02.237
Please.

1:09:02.306 --> 1:09:04.280
Behold.

1:09:06.280 --> 1:09:09.483
A pale horse emerged...

1:09:14.826 --> 1:09:18.789
And death was its rider.

1:09:26.497 --> 1:09:28.865
And all hell followed!

1:09:31.870 --> 1:09:36.774
Major! It's me!
It's Lynise! Please!

1:09:41.115 --> 1:09:42.844
Major, please!

1:09:42.913 --> 1:09:45.881
Don't worry, doctor.
No need to worry.

1:09:45.950 --> 1:09:47.989
I'm pulling
the cold air out there.

1:09:48.058 --> 1:09:51.992
Major, tell me about...

1:09:52.061 --> 1:09:54.396
tell me about Joseph

1:09:54.464 --> 1:09:57.399
when he finally revealed
himself to his brothers!

1:10:01.840 --> 1:10:03.467
What did Joseph do?

1:10:03.536 --> 1:10:05.039
After the terrible injustice

1:10:05.108 --> 1:10:06.336
done to him by his brothers...

1:10:06.405 --> 1:10:08.344
What did Joseph do?

1:10:10.078 --> 1:10:11.842
What did he do?

1:10:16.613 --> 1:10:19.553
He offered forgiveness...

1:10:20.856 --> 1:10:23.352
Yes!

1:10:23.421 --> 1:10:28.690
Genesis- 20.

1:10:28.759 --> 1:10:32.200
"You intended to cause me harm,

1:10:32.269 --> 1:10:34.295
but God intended
it all for good."

1:10:46.149 --> 1:10:48.650
I need you to breathe this in!

1:10:48.719 --> 1:10:49.546
Breathe!

1:10:49.615 --> 1:10:50.751
The oxygen will kill the fungus!

1:10:50.820 --> 1:10:51.714
Breathe!

1:10:51.782 --> 1:10:55.190
No!
Breathe, please breathe!

1:10:55.259 --> 1:10:57.526
There you go,
there you go.

1:10:57.594 --> 1:11:00.726
There you go.
Keep breathing, keep breathing.

1:11:04.034 --> 1:11:05.932
Good, Major, good.

1:11:06.001 --> 1:11:07.337
Okay.

1:11:08.103 --> 1:11:10.335
Now I need this.

1:11:10.403 --> 1:11:12.342
Keep breathing, Major.

1:11:15.639 --> 1:11:17.842
General, this is Lynise!

1:11:19.178 --> 1:11:21.944
Dr. Hughes, where is the Major?
What's happening there?

1:11:22.013 --> 1:11:23.782
The Major was infected
by the fungus.

1:11:23.850 --> 1:11:25.320
I was able to clear
it out of his system

1:11:25.389 --> 1:11:26.818
with the oxygen
from a respirator.

1:11:26.887 --> 1:11:28.851
Listen, I don't have
time to explain all that.

1:11:28.920 --> 1:11:31.191
Can you find us
on your satellite?

1:11:31.260 --> 1:11:33.156
We're in a Chinook helicopter.

1:11:33.225 --> 1:11:39.628
Our coordinates are 10.7739
Sierra by 37.5861 Whiskey.

1:11:39.697 --> 1:11:41.330
Are you over Lago Do Fodo?

1:11:41.399 --> 1:11:42.634
Yes, yes.

1:11:42.703 --> 1:11:44.506
We have a huge bomb
from the airport.

1:11:44.575 --> 1:11:46.069
And we're gonna drop it
over the epicenter

1:11:46.138 --> 1:11:48.510
because the ordnance isn't
gonna get here in time.

1:11:48.579 --> 1:11:51.140
The Major has promised me
it's going to work.

1:11:51.209 --> 1:11:53.779
But I still need you to use
the infrared satellite

1:11:53.848 --> 1:11:56.115
and guide us directly
over the epicenter.

1:11:56.184 --> 1:11:57.217
Can you do that?

1:11:57.286 --> 1:11:59.015
Absolutely.
Stand by.

1:12:00.858 --> 1:12:01.985
Okay.

1:12:04.756 --> 1:12:06.525
Let me get in there, doctor.

1:12:06.594 --> 1:12:09.025
-Let me in there.
-Okay, okay.

1:12:10.730 --> 1:12:14.366
The General is
gonna guide us

1:12:14.435 --> 1:12:16.065
to the epicenter, okay?

1:12:17.571 --> 1:12:18.973
Who's flying the helicopter?

1:12:19.042 --> 1:12:20.577
The Major is now.

1:12:20.645 --> 1:12:23.610
Good. Glad to hear that oxygen
is an effective antidote.

1:12:23.679 --> 1:12:25.614
We have eyes on
the epicenter, Major.

1:12:25.682 --> 1:12:28.945
I want you to take
a heading out in vector 4.7.

1:12:29.014 --> 1:12:30.850
I've lost access
to my guidance systems.

1:12:30.918 --> 1:12:33.416
I'll need you to direct me
with landmarks, General.

1:12:33.484 --> 1:12:35.051
Copy that.

1:12:35.119 --> 1:12:38.225
I need you to reduce
your speed to 160 knots.

1:12:38.294 --> 1:12:40.463
Target is to your- 00.

1:12:41.662 --> 1:12:43.994
Copy.
Adjusting coordinates.

1:12:48.068 --> 1:12:51.837
You're 55 meters on target.
Stay on that heading.

1:12:54.510 --> 1:12:56.204
Gasses are rising
to the surface.

1:12:56.273 --> 1:12:58.613
It's getting ready to
blow any minute now!

1:12:58.681 --> 1:13:00.647
Okay. You're directly over
the epicenter.

1:13:00.716 --> 1:13:02.144
Push yourself into
a holding pattern,

1:13:02.212 --> 1:13:05.048
drop your ordnance
and get out of there!

1:13:08.286 --> 1:13:11.191
Confirm holding pattern,
preparing to drop ordnance.

1:13:11.260 --> 1:13:13.023
Engaging autopilot.

1:13:16.094 --> 1:13:21.268
Doctor, there's a switch,
a release switch,

1:13:21.336 --> 1:13:23.501
behind the door there.

1:13:23.570 --> 1:13:27.076
Turn the top dial first

1:13:27.145 --> 1:13:29.939
and the second dial after.

1:13:30.008 --> 1:13:32.748
-That'll release the bomb.
-Okay.

1:13:32.817 --> 1:13:33.978
Top.

1:13:37.252 --> 1:13:39.456
First, and sec--

1:13:41.222 --> 1:13:42.954
Um...

1:13:46.359 --> 1:13:47.491
I'm sorry.

1:13:47.560 --> 1:13:49.159
What? What happened?

1:13:49.228 --> 1:13:52.133
Mechanical failure,
a loss of hydraulic pressure.

1:13:52.202 --> 1:13:53.501
Okay, but what do we do?

1:13:53.570 --> 1:13:56.402
Must be a leak.
There's nothing...

1:13:56.471 --> 1:13:58.941
There's nothing to do, doctor.

1:13:59.009 --> 1:13:59.834
It's over.

1:13:59.903 --> 1:14:02.643
Well, can't we cut the cables?

1:14:02.712 --> 1:14:05.042
You can't cut
those cables, doctor.

1:14:05.111 --> 1:14:06.842
They're holding up an
8,000 kilogram bomb.

1:14:06.911 --> 1:14:08.683
They're not made out of string.

1:14:12.156 --> 1:14:13.919
What's happening, Major?

1:14:16.494 --> 1:14:19.925
Sorry, doctor...
I'm not feeling well.

1:14:27.103 --> 1:14:28.131
Okay.

1:14:31.272 --> 1:14:32.501
Major?

1:14:32.570 --> 1:14:34.843
Major?

1:14:34.911 --> 1:14:39.076
Major, I'm gonna crash
the helicopter into the lake.

1:14:41.186 --> 1:14:42.882
There's no greater love

1:14:42.951 --> 1:14:45.181
than to lay your life
down for your brother.

1:14:46.156 --> 1:14:47.183
I like that.

1:14:49.261 --> 1:14:52.420
General?
This is Lynise.

1:14:52.489 --> 1:14:55.693
The other payload should be
there within three hours.

1:14:55.762 --> 1:14:57.895
General, there is no time left.

1:14:57.963 --> 1:14:59.931
Is there any way
to fix this lever?

1:15:00.000 --> 1:15:02.431
It could be
several things, doctor.

1:15:02.500 --> 1:15:06.174
He said it's something with the
hydraulics, loss of fluid maybe.

1:15:06.243 --> 1:15:07.542
That can't be fixed.

1:15:07.611 --> 1:15:09.676
You need to have
the helicopter grounded.

1:15:09.744 --> 1:15:11.207
I'm not going down
without a fight.

1:15:11.276 --> 1:15:13.412
We're gonna crash
the helicopter into the lake.

1:15:13.481 --> 1:15:14.913
You're gonna what?

1:15:14.982 --> 1:15:17.016
We're going to crash
the helicopter!

1:15:17.085 --> 1:15:18.752
That won't work, doctor.
The firing mechanism won't--

1:15:18.821 --> 1:15:21.621
The firing mechanism
is heat activated.

1:15:21.690 --> 1:15:23.892
Hold on!
Don't do anything rash!

1:15:23.961 --> 1:15:25.628
As long as the helicopter makes
contact with the magma chamber,

1:15:25.697 --> 1:15:27.657
the heat from the volcano
should be high enough

1:15:27.726 --> 1:15:29.495
to trigger the bomb.

1:15:29.564 --> 1:15:31.799
It's our only option, General.

1:15:43.078 --> 1:15:47.943
Okay, Major, tell me about
one of your best memories,

1:15:48.012 --> 1:15:50.051
maybe something about church?

1:15:50.120 --> 1:15:52.249
My mom...

1:15:52.318 --> 1:15:55.885
I used to love going to church
each Sunday with my mom.

1:15:55.954 --> 1:15:57.556
Oh, good.
That sounds nice.

1:15:57.624 --> 1:15:59.561
Tell me what it was like.

1:15:59.629 --> 1:16:02.929
I had to
pass the collection plate.

1:16:03.761 --> 1:16:05.300
I dropped it.

1:16:05.368 --> 1:16:07.670
She said it was okay.

1:16:08.833 --> 1:16:10.199
What happened then?

1:16:10.268 --> 1:16:13.841
She went under the pews
to get the money.

1:16:14.709 --> 1:16:17.373
She told me it wasn't my fault.

1:16:17.442 --> 1:16:20.342
Oh, that was so nice of her,
really nice of her.

1:16:23.354 --> 1:16:24.852
Okay.
Okay, Major.

1:16:24.921 --> 1:16:28.156
Major, look, it's gonna
be all right, okay?

1:16:28.224 --> 1:16:29.824
I got you.

1:16:33.130 --> 1:16:34.158
Look!

1:16:36.631 --> 1:16:38.230
We have to go get them!

1:16:38.299 --> 1:16:39.667
Will they even be alive because
of the volcanic fumes?

1:16:39.735 --> 1:16:40.965
Isn't that water
extremely caustic?

1:16:41.034 --> 1:16:43.299
No, no, no!
The lake is alkaline.

1:16:43.368 --> 1:16:45.601
The limestone neutralizes
the volcanic acids.

1:16:45.670 --> 1:16:47.637
There!

1:16:47.706 --> 1:16:49.073
Affirmative!

1:16:49.142 --> 1:16:51.073
Scavenger, we have
two heat signatures.

1:16:51.142 --> 1:16:52.815
It looks like they're
moving to

1:16:52.884 --> 1:16:54.915
the north-eastern shoreline
headed straight for you!

1:16:58.616 --> 1:17:00.119
Come on!

1:17:00.187 --> 1:17:02.951
Hey, you guys, over here!
Help me get Oakley out!

1:17:03.020 --> 1:17:04.386
I got you, Major, come on!

1:17:04.455 --> 1:17:07.191
Major, major, major,
come here, come here.

1:17:08.593 --> 1:17:09.864
Come on!

1:17:11.301 --> 1:17:12.933
Come on, big guy!

1:17:13.867 --> 1:17:15.667
Hey, what happened to the bomb?

1:17:15.735 --> 1:17:17.137
Why didn't it go off?

1:17:17.206 --> 1:17:19.036
Come on.

1:17:19.105 --> 1:17:21.574
That ordnance...
it has a supersonic

1:17:21.643 --> 1:17:23.372
impact casing in the head.

1:17:23.441 --> 1:17:25.010
It won't blow until it
reaches temperature

1:17:25.079 --> 1:17:26.415
from the heat inside
the magma chamber.

1:17:26.484 --> 1:17:27.415
We have to get out of here!

1:17:27.483 --> 1:17:29.818
-Let's go!
-Go, go!

1:17:35.018 --> 1:17:36.618
We've got them, Zeus!

1:17:36.687 --> 1:17:39.696
We have all thee guests and
Major Jones in possession!

1:17:40.628 --> 1:17:42.292
Get to safety now!

1:18:18.302 --> 1:18:19.399
I can't breathe.

1:18:19.468 --> 1:18:21.431
That's normal.

1:18:21.500 --> 1:18:23.365
Ordinance sucks the oxygen
right out of your lungs

1:18:23.434 --> 1:18:25.401
when you're this close
to detonation.

1:18:27.344 --> 1:18:28.474
Did we do it?

1:18:28.543 --> 1:18:29.779
I can't tell yet.

1:18:39.455 --> 1:18:41.685
General, look.

1:18:41.754 --> 1:18:42.990
The monitor!

1:18:54.031 --> 1:18:55.332
It looks like it worked.

1:18:57.408 --> 1:18:58.901
It looks like it worked!

1:18:58.970 --> 1:19:00.638
Yes, it did, ma'am!

1:19:03.139 --> 1:19:04.880
Nice work, soldier.

1:19:06.382 --> 1:19:07.779
Scavenger.

1:19:07.848 --> 1:19:09.177
Scavenger, do you read me?

1:19:09.246 --> 1:19:11.419
Please tell me you're okay.

1:19:11.488 --> 1:19:13.284
Scavenger, come in.

1:19:14.819 --> 1:19:16.291
Scavenger.

1:19:16.360 --> 1:19:17.727
Oh, thank God.

1:19:17.796 --> 1:19:20.190
I am looking at
feed all over the globe.

1:19:20.258 --> 1:19:23.091
And it seems like
you stopped it!

1:19:23.159 --> 1:19:25.032
Excellent news, Zeus.

1:19:25.100 --> 1:19:27.265
I'd like to speak to
Dr. Hughes if I may.

1:19:30.268 --> 1:19:33.104
General Norris...
I mean, Zeus.

1:19:33.173 --> 1:19:35.103
No need for mil spec
talk, doctor.

1:19:35.172 --> 1:19:37.480
This is a secured line.

1:19:37.549 --> 1:19:39.147
We are getting satellite imagery

1:19:39.216 --> 1:19:43.549
that shows the entire chain
reaction is shutting down.

1:19:43.617 --> 1:19:45.986
All right!

1:19:46.055 --> 1:19:47.955
The storm systems
appear to be clearing.

1:19:48.024 --> 1:19:50.019
The locust swarms appear
to be dropping off

1:19:50.087 --> 1:19:52.225
at a substantial rate.

1:19:52.293 --> 1:19:55.764
And it looks as though
the geothermal readings

1:19:55.833 --> 1:19:57.929
are dropping rapidly
at Lago Do Fodo.

1:19:57.998 --> 1:20:00.133
Great to hear that, General.

1:20:00.201 --> 1:20:01.898
And what of the
infection you spoke of?

1:20:01.967 --> 1:20:03.534
Regarding the fungi?

1:20:03.603 --> 1:20:06.271
General, I'm gonna let
Dr. Rodney fill you in on that.

1:20:08.372 --> 1:20:13.476
Hello. Hi.
Elliot Rodney here.

1:20:15.653 --> 1:20:17.412
It's our respiratory systems.

1:20:17.481 --> 1:20:19.153
As soon as I get back
to my labs,

1:20:19.222 --> 1:20:22.158
I can synthesize a compound
that we can release

1:20:22.227 --> 1:20:25.288
in aerosol form so we can spread
it through the locust swarms.

1:20:25.357 --> 1:20:27.524
It'll also spread
from human to human,

1:20:27.592 --> 1:20:30.128
neutralizing the neural
effect of the fungus.

1:20:30.197 --> 1:20:33.133
Outstanding, Dr. Rodney,
outstanding.

1:20:34.400 --> 1:20:37.005
You wanna say something?
We all did our part.

1:20:38.271 --> 1:20:40.842
General, this is
Dakota Lenna speaking.

1:20:40.910 --> 1:20:42.538
Good to hear your voice,
Dr. Lenna.

1:20:42.606 --> 1:20:44.344
The cloud seeding worked
exactly as planned.

1:20:44.412 --> 1:20:47.179
With the immense rush of
cooler air from the atmosphere,

1:20:47.248 --> 1:20:49.716
we'll soon be
stabilize weather systems

1:20:49.784 --> 1:20:51.284
along the jet stream.

1:20:51.353 --> 1:20:54.121
I'm watching it happen
via satellite as we speak.

1:20:54.190 --> 1:20:57.124
Excellent work from all of you!
Thank you!

1:20:57.193 --> 1:20:59.187
You've all done
the world a great service.

1:20:59.256 --> 1:21:00.890
Just doing our job, ma'am.

1:21:03.133 --> 1:21:06.197
General, we're getting
calls from all over.

1:21:06.265 --> 1:21:08.400
They want to speak
with you, ma'am.

1:21:08.469 --> 1:21:11.739
Everyone, I've got a few
people that I need to talk to.

1:21:11.808 --> 1:21:13.709
We can converse a little later.

1:21:13.778 --> 1:21:17.373
Copy that, Zeus.
Scavenger out.

1:21:17.441 --> 1:21:20.983
You guys, we did it!
We did it!

1:21:22.047 --> 1:21:23.685
Let's not do it again.

1:21:23.754 --> 1:21:26.916
-We did it!
-Good job!

1:21:37.764 --> 1:21:40.266
Yeah!

1:21:42.900 --> 1:21:45.040
Come on.

1:21:45.974 --> 1:21:50.078
Lynise, I owe you an apology.

1:21:50.880 --> 1:21:52.645
No apology necessary, Major.

1:21:52.714 --> 1:21:54.944
All is forgiven.

1:21:55.012 --> 1:21:58.053
Thank you.
