WEBVTT

00:15.208 --> 00:17.416
-Whoa!

00:19.500 --> 00:21.250
Ah!

00:26.958 --> 00:28.458
-Ah! No!
-Huh?

00:30.583 --> 00:31.416
Ah!

00:32.541 --> 00:33.458
Ouch!

00:46.125 --> 00:47.916
-Hey!

00:59.041 --> 01:00.166
Whoa!

01:00.666 --> 01:02.500
-Get yourself a piece of goat head.

01:07.125 --> 01:09.375
Ugh!

01:26.833 --> 01:29.166
Everything worked out fine.

01:56.666 --> 01:57.666
Hmm.

02:05.000 --> 02:07.208
I can't believe Courtney betrayed us.

02:07.291 --> 02:09.500
I can absolutely believe
Courtney betrayed us.

02:11.916 --> 02:13.541
Mom? Dad?

02:13.625 --> 02:16.416
Ugh, they were probably only here
to see me.

02:16.500 --> 02:19.250
-If I hadn't run away--
-Barney, this isn't your fault.

02:19.333 --> 02:22.750
It's Temeluchus'
and Courtney's and Pauline's.

02:22.833 --> 02:24.458
And that new one too, I guess.

02:24.541 --> 02:26.625
Man, we have a lot of enemies.

02:26.708 --> 02:28.625
And Patrick's out there somewhere.

02:28.708 --> 02:30.125
I have to find him.

02:34.166 --> 02:37.333
Stay perfectly still.
Their vision is based on movement.

02:37.416 --> 02:39.458
I don't think it is.

02:42.583 --> 02:45.458
My bad, I thought I read that
in one of Pugsley's demon books.

02:45.541 --> 02:47.833
Wait, of course. The books.

02:47.916 --> 02:49.125
They're back at the house.

02:49.208 --> 02:51.250
Come on, maybe we can
look up a way to beat them.

02:51.333 --> 02:53.500
You go. I-I need to find Patrick.

02:53.583 --> 02:55.458
Okay. Meet me back here in ten minutes.

02:55.541 --> 02:58.000
Unless we get eaten. Then make it 15.

03:13.958 --> 03:17.500
Ugh. Temeluchus, this plane is so grody.

03:17.583 --> 03:19.541
But you always had weird taste.

03:19.625 --> 03:22.875
I didn't have much choice.
It was the only--

03:25.083 --> 03:27.333
I did it. I'm back.

03:27.416 --> 03:29.000
Where am I?

03:29.083 --> 03:31.000
Wait? Where's Barney?

03:31.083 --> 03:32.250
What was that, Tem?

03:32.916 --> 03:34.041
Uh-oh.

03:34.125 --> 03:36.458
Where is Barney?

03:36.541 --> 03:39.125
I wish to eat him

03:39.208 --> 03:42.750
because, um, he looks, uh, yummy

03:42.833 --> 03:45.875
and, um… Uh, I haven't eaten in days

03:45.958 --> 03:50.000
and the recommended
daily calorie intake of a pug is…

03:51.500 --> 03:55.333
I can't believe you're in a dog.
It's so stupid.

04:06.208 --> 04:08.666
Norma, you're alive.

04:08.750 --> 04:10.166
What're you guys doing here?

04:10.250 --> 04:13.208
Lockdown procedures. Step one, assemble.

04:13.291 --> 04:14.625
This was the nearest building.

04:14.708 --> 04:15.958
What's step two?

04:16.041 --> 04:17.875
Uh, hide and cower?

04:17.958 --> 04:20.666
Ugh. Who came up with these procedures?

04:20.750 --> 04:24.500
That'd be me, ya little twerps.

04:25.833 --> 04:27.708
Uh, quick question.

04:27.791 --> 04:31.583
Why is Pauline Phoenix green… and dead?

04:37.208 --> 04:38.375
Patrick!

04:40.750 --> 04:41.791
Patrick?

04:41.875 --> 04:43.583
Barney?

04:44.125 --> 04:45.541
Where are you?

04:46.458 --> 04:48.291
Barney, I'm right here!

04:48.375 --> 04:50.208
Where are you?

04:50.291 --> 04:51.250
Patrick!

05:01.541 --> 05:02.541
Huh?

05:02.625 --> 05:04.000
Whoa!

05:07.625 --> 05:09.458
-Barney!

05:10.041 --> 05:12.791
I did it! I actually did it!

05:12.875 --> 05:14.750
Help!

05:14.833 --> 05:16.125
Patrick?

05:17.791 --> 05:19.458
-Barney!

05:23.333 --> 05:26.416
This is so boring!

05:28.041 --> 05:29.416
You've gone all quiet, Tem.

05:29.500 --> 05:31.208
I thought this'd be a party.

05:32.375 --> 05:35.333
Remember that little weird dude
who crashed my birthday?

05:35.416 --> 05:39.333
You spun around his organs so that
he had a headache in his butt!

05:39.416 --> 05:40.833
I did what?

05:45.000 --> 05:48.541
Yeah,
and he was sneezing farts,

05:48.625 --> 05:51.416
like…

05:58.500 --> 05:59.666
Finally.

06:02.000 --> 06:04.041
-Take out's here.
-No!

06:04.125 --> 06:06.666
Uh, this one is mine.

06:06.750 --> 06:08.166
I call dibs.

06:08.250 --> 06:11.416
He looks so, uh, delicious and adorable.

06:11.500 --> 06:13.208
Pugsley! What's going on?

06:13.291 --> 06:14.375
Pugsley?

06:14.458 --> 06:16.416
Oh, um, uh, yes.

06:16.500 --> 06:22.458
It's the human word for, um,
"Oh, great merciful ruler!"

06:22.541 --> 06:23.875
-Merciful?
-Huh?

06:23.958 --> 06:27.000
Dude, you're the Chieftain of Torment.
Eat him!

06:45.625 --> 06:48.125
Come on, give him a real bite.

06:48.208 --> 06:51.291
I had a big lunch.
I ate a whole orchestra.

06:51.375 --> 06:53.291
I knew it. You're not my brother.

06:53.375 --> 06:54.708
You're an impostor!

06:54.791 --> 06:59.375
Which means the human's mine!

07:00.625 --> 07:02.166
Oh, no, you--

07:02.250 --> 07:04.625
Don't!

07:06.458 --> 07:07.333
Huh?

07:16.083 --> 07:18.291
-Ugh!

07:23.666 --> 07:24.750
Pugsley?

07:24.833 --> 07:26.375
That is not my name!

07:26.458 --> 07:28.875
I am the great Demon Chieftain of--

07:28.958 --> 07:30.375
You saved me!

07:31.000 --> 07:32.833
Ugh. So I did.

07:32.916 --> 07:34.583
You've poisoned me, human.

07:34.666 --> 07:36.666
-Poisoned me with affection.

07:36.750 --> 07:38.875
I don't even know what I am anymore.

07:38.958 --> 07:39.875
Exactly.

07:40.541 --> 07:42.458
This plane has gotten to you, Tem.

07:42.541 --> 07:44.291
You're in no position to rule it.

07:44.375 --> 07:47.750
Which means I'm gonna have
to take this plane…

07:49.500 --> 07:50.958
by force.

07:58.458 --> 08:00.708
Hey, it's my welcome home party.

08:00.791 --> 08:02.333
Anyone for karaoke?

08:04.916 --> 08:08.875
Oh, great. Alone. Again.

08:09.541 --> 08:11.166
Maybe I'm the problem.

08:11.916 --> 08:14.166
I'll be your friend.

08:14.250 --> 08:15.708
Nah. I'm great.

08:15.791 --> 08:17.000
No, no! No!

08:17.083 --> 08:20.666
<i>Breaking news, Temeluchus and Zagan</i>
<i>of The Demonic Royal Family</i>

08:20.750 --> 08:23.500

08:36.000 --> 08:39.000

08:43.375 --> 08:44.250
Hey!

08:59.500 --> 09:01.291
They took him! They took Patrick!

09:02.375 --> 09:05.750
Right. Everyone,
there is a lost child in the park.

09:05.833 --> 09:07.708
Forget there's demons,
forget there's magic.

09:07.791 --> 09:08.875
Just do your jobs.

09:09.500 --> 09:11.958
You're the security guards. What do we do?

09:15.583 --> 09:17.250
Right. Everyone listen up.

09:17.333 --> 09:19.875
Custodian, you're
on chief demon-bashing duty.

09:20.875 --> 09:23.791
Burgers, Smoothie, stay here
and defend the house.

09:23.875 --> 09:26.333
Impersonator,
Less Convincing Impersonator,

09:26.416 --> 09:28.541
find the survivors,
and get them out of the park.

09:29.416 --> 09:31.458
Ferris Wheel, fan out for Main Street.

09:31.541 --> 09:33.250
Ferris wheel? I have a name.

09:33.333 --> 09:34.875
No time for niceties. Now git.

09:34.958 --> 09:37.083
Nice leadership, but I do think
it helps to learn people's--

09:37.166 --> 09:38.541
Deathslide, you're with me.

09:38.625 --> 09:39.500
Yes, ma'am!

09:42.500 --> 09:43.416
And you.

09:44.125 --> 09:47.958
Why should I help you
after you ruined my comeback?

09:48.041 --> 09:49.958
What did I ever do to you?

09:50.625 --> 09:52.500
Actually don't answer that.

09:52.583 --> 09:55.416
You know, the real way to live forever
is by leaving a legacy.

09:55.500 --> 09:58.666
Right now, what's happening in this park,
that's your legacy.

09:58.750 --> 09:59.875
Is this what you want?

09:59.958 --> 10:03.875
Oh, I'll never get what I want.
Give up on me. Everyone else has.

10:03.958 --> 10:05.125
Okay.

10:05.708 --> 10:06.583
Good luck.

10:15.416 --> 10:17.375
Uh, when I said we should hang out more,

10:17.458 --> 10:19.458
-this isn't what I had in mind.

10:19.541 --> 10:20.375
Really?

10:20.458 --> 10:23.041
Oh, yeah, fair enough.
This is exactly what I had in mind.

10:24.583 --> 10:26.416
That's a suplex-able offense!

10:26.500 --> 10:27.666
Ee-yah!

10:28.166 --> 10:30.041
Whoa, nice move!

10:30.125 --> 10:32.416
Yeah, it's, uh, called a suplex.

10:32.500 --> 10:35.375
So that's why I said
suplex-able offense because I--

10:35.458 --> 10:37.666
Yeah, no, I got it. It was cool.

10:37.750 --> 10:39.333
Cool.

10:40.708 --> 10:43.708
The implings must have taken Patrick
to the Demon Kings.

10:43.791 --> 10:46.833
Where would two Demon Kings
wanna call home?

10:48.166 --> 10:49.833
To Camelot!

10:54.458 --> 10:56.583
You only came up to steal my plane!

10:56.666 --> 10:59.041
You've always been jealous!

10:59.125 --> 11:00.375
My little good boy hat!

11:00.458 --> 11:03.166
Get real, Tem. You're busted.

11:03.250 --> 11:05.708
And you can't decide
if you're a demon or a dog.

11:07.333 --> 11:08.166
Huh?

11:08.250 --> 11:11.500
When I tell Mom about
what you've been doing, she's gonna flip!

11:11.583 --> 11:12.625
-Shh!
-Oh, yeah?

11:12.708 --> 11:14.875
Well, I'll tell her about the--

11:14.958 --> 11:16.500
Facelock!

11:16.583 --> 11:18.500
Leg hold!

11:21.000 --> 11:21.833
Watch out!

11:21.916 --> 11:22.875
No!

11:30.083 --> 11:31.416
How could you?

11:35.541 --> 11:37.666
You monster!

11:37.750 --> 11:39.416
Aw, thanks.

11:49.791 --> 11:50.625
Huh?

12:02.000 --> 12:05.708
Come one step closer,
and they'll drop your little buddies.

12:10.250 --> 12:11.833
Take me instead.

12:11.916 --> 12:13.541
Oh, I intend to,

12:13.625 --> 12:16.416
but first,
I'm getting my brother out of you.

12:19.000 --> 12:21.958
I'm back.

12:29.416 --> 12:32.083
Guys? Guys?

12:34.625 --> 12:35.666
Anybody?

12:47.208 --> 12:49.583
Good. Now that we're all here…

12:53.333 --> 12:56.750
Sit. Stay. Good dog.

12:57.375 --> 12:59.500
The park is ours!

12:59.583 --> 13:00.625
Woop, woop!

13:01.958 --> 13:03.791
But this is only the start.

13:03.875 --> 13:06.291
This plane is like ginormous!

13:06.375 --> 13:08.291
Way bigger than the ones down there.

13:08.375 --> 13:10.583
We've got a lot of work to do.

13:10.666 --> 13:15.250
Those upstairs are gonna be pressed
over us conquering the neutral plane.

13:15.333 --> 13:18.833
But when the angels retaliate,
we'll be ready!

13:20.125 --> 13:24.875
But first, this beast has held my brother
in its dumb little body long enough.

13:24.958 --> 13:27.083
It's time to put down the dog.

13:28.541 --> 13:30.875
Zagan! Zagan! Zagan!

13:30.958 --> 13:34.291
Please, Temeluchus,
I know we've not always seen eye-to-eye,

13:34.375 --> 13:36.750
but if you just
come back and stop her,

13:36.833 --> 13:39.000
I'll make sure you get
all the belly rubs you ever want.

13:42.875 --> 13:43.708
What?

13:44.750 --> 13:45.916
You rang?

13:46.000 --> 13:47.666
Oh, great. You.

13:47.750 --> 13:49.458
I know, I know.

13:49.541 --> 13:53.125
"Oh, great. It's Courtney,
the one who totally betrayed us."

13:53.208 --> 13:56.041
Look, I know this is rich coming from me,

13:56.125 --> 13:59.000
but you gotta
get back out there and fight!

13:59.083 --> 14:01.666
But how? I can't control Temeluchus.

14:01.750 --> 14:03.291
He's not co-op--

14:03.375 --> 14:06.791
I know you're down there.
Come out and play, little doggy.

14:06.875 --> 14:08.916
Hey! Wrong demon!

14:10.458 --> 14:11.500
Pugsley, take this.

14:13.791 --> 14:15.375
You're not playing with a full deck.

14:15.458 --> 14:19.041
You only got a little bit of him.

14:19.125 --> 14:22.500
But if I let him take over,
I'm not sure I can come back.

14:24.541 --> 14:26.458
Pugsley, trust me.

14:27.041 --> 14:27.875
Why?

14:28.458 --> 14:29.416
Good point.

14:35.375 --> 14:37.166
You'll be fine.

14:41.750 --> 14:45.250
There you are.
Now hold still so I can execute you.

15:13.208 --> 15:14.500
Ah.

15:17.041 --> 15:21.625
Hey, Temmy, I was trying to save you,
not execute you.

15:21.708 --> 15:23.291
And look, totally worked and--

15:23.375 --> 15:29.375
You tried to wrestle this plane from me
to steal my glorious conquest!

15:29.458 --> 15:33.625
But that body, you're not yourself.
You changed.

15:33.708 --> 15:35.583
Maybe so.

15:42.833 --> 15:45.791
What are you waiting for?
Get them!

16:00.041 --> 16:01.250
Whoa!

16:05.416 --> 16:08.166
Come on, put some back into it.

16:08.250 --> 16:09.791
Oh, hey.

16:09.875 --> 16:12.750
Well, if it isn't my old pal,
big fat liar!

16:12.833 --> 16:15.333
What?

16:16.375 --> 16:17.500
Why are you helping?

16:17.583 --> 16:19.875
This park is my legacy.

16:19.958 --> 16:23.166
And I'd rather not have
hundreds of people dying in it.

16:23.250 --> 16:26.041
I'm not having a repeat
of Phoenix Parks Europe!

16:37.333 --> 16:40.333
Time to say night night, little doggy.

16:40.416 --> 16:42.625
Huh?

16:56.666 --> 16:59.583
No! Not my favorite arm!

17:07.083 --> 17:09.625
Ugh! This isn't fair.

17:09.708 --> 17:14.416
When Mom hears about this,
you're gonna be so dead. Again!

17:27.791 --> 17:30.458
Have fun dealing with
the angels without me.

17:39.875 --> 17:42.000
We did it! We did it!

17:46.791 --> 17:50.125
The neutral plane is mine once again.

17:51.541 --> 17:54.666
Yay, we're saved. Hooray.

17:57.500 --> 17:58.958
No! Stop!

18:00.208 --> 18:02.208
Ah, little Red.

18:02.291 --> 18:06.208
So desperately lonely,
you befriended humans.

18:06.291 --> 18:11.666
How does it feel to be at rock bottom
and still find a way to fall?

18:13.833 --> 18:15.000
Interesting.

18:15.083 --> 18:17.416
Sounds like you know the feeling.

18:19.208 --> 18:22.083
It's okay. You can stop pretending.

18:24.291 --> 18:25.375
Yeah, do it.

18:27.041 --> 18:28.791
Okay.

18:31.833 --> 18:33.208
Uh-huh. Do it.

18:37.083 --> 18:39.708
No, I can't.

18:39.791 --> 18:41.250
I don't understand.

18:41.333 --> 18:42.916
Yeah, you do.

18:43.000 --> 18:45.708
Because that little piece of you
that stayed in Pugsley

18:45.791 --> 18:48.000
got to see everything he did.

18:48.083 --> 18:51.250
<i>Barney's Sunday morning</i>
<i>blueberry pancakes,</i>

18:51.333 --> 18:56.458
<i>Norma's TV viewing parties slash lectures,</i>
<i>and the cuddles.</i>

18:56.541 --> 19:01.541
You learned to love humans
alongside Pugsley and alongside me.

19:11.000 --> 19:12.250
Uh, you okay?

19:14.208 --> 19:16.000
What have you done to me?

19:16.083 --> 19:19.500
I'm tellin' ya, humans are contagious.

19:19.583 --> 19:22.166
They got a way
of gettin' under your scales.

19:22.250 --> 19:25.375
But it's not so bad if you let it happen.

19:46.041 --> 19:47.833
He's gonna be fine.

19:47.916 --> 19:50.083
I'll try patching things up
with my sister.

19:50.583 --> 19:52.708
Give her a few kingdoms or something.

19:52.791 --> 19:55.041
Families are hard. Don't stress about it.

19:56.916 --> 19:59.083
You sure you don't wanna come back down?

19:59.166 --> 20:01.083
I could give you diplomatic immunity.

20:03.041 --> 20:06.791
I've got everything I need
right here, Your Majesty.

20:06.875 --> 20:08.041
Mm-hmm.

20:32.000 --> 20:33.875
Huh?

20:33.958 --> 20:34.916
Sorry.

20:39.875 --> 20:40.750
Logs!

20:40.833 --> 20:42.208
Barney, are you okay?

20:42.291 --> 20:44.041
I was so scared. I thought--

20:44.125 --> 20:46.916
I thought
I was never gonna get a chance to…

20:52.333 --> 20:55.208
You're welcome. You're welcome, darlings.

20:55.291 --> 20:57.333
How's that for a comeback, huh?

20:57.416 --> 20:59.250
I saved you all.

20:59.333 --> 21:01.500
Yes. It was me.

21:01.583 --> 21:04.791
Wow, those kids were amazing.
They saved us.

21:04.875 --> 21:07.916
Never a huge fan of Pauline,
but these kids.

21:08.000 --> 21:09.500
Ah, forget it.

21:10.291 --> 21:11.458
Sweetie!

21:11.541 --> 21:12.708
Mom, Dad.

21:13.458 --> 21:14.833
I'm so glad you're okay.

21:14.916 --> 21:17.291
We're glad you're okay too.

21:17.916 --> 21:21.458
I'm not sure exactly what we watched.
But, uh, it was amazing.

21:21.541 --> 21:26.625
Uh, we kind of keep things
to ourselves here, darlin'.

21:27.666 --> 21:30.250
Look, honey. I owe you an apology.

21:30.333 --> 21:31.708
-Mom--
-No, let me finish.

21:31.791 --> 21:34.958
I've been so worried about keeping
the peace with Grammy Gram

21:35.041 --> 21:37.916
that I wasn't thinking
about how it was affecting you.

21:38.000 --> 21:40.833
I think running away might be
a Guttman family trait.

21:40.916 --> 21:42.958
I'm scared of confronting my mom too.

21:43.041 --> 21:46.208
Oh, Grammy Gram is way scarier
than you.

21:46.291 --> 21:49.916
Right? She nearly blew her top
when you shaved your head, Roxie.

21:50.000 --> 21:51.250
You did what?

21:51.333 --> 21:52.666
Oh, I was a kid.

21:53.250 --> 21:55.625
Well, I was about your age, actually.

21:56.125 --> 22:00.125
Look Grammy Gram is
a very interesting person, you know.

22:00.208 --> 22:03.000
But that doesn't make it okay
for her to treat you like that.

22:03.083 --> 22:05.916
I can come to Friday night dinners.
It's fine.

22:06.000 --> 22:07.250
No, it's not.

22:07.333 --> 22:09.208
And you're not having
another dinner with her

22:09.291 --> 22:10.916
until she realizes what she did.

22:11.000 --> 22:12.041
We'll talk to her.

22:12.125 --> 22:15.583
We have your back from now on.
I'm sorry we didn't before.

22:15.666 --> 22:19.250
Maybe Saturday night dinners
can be our thing though.

22:19.333 --> 22:21.625
Plus I want to know what's been going on.

22:25.208 --> 22:28.291
Sure you don't want to come with us?
It's kind of a mess here.

22:28.375 --> 22:30.125
That's why I fit in.

22:33.041 --> 22:34.291
Barney?

22:34.875 --> 22:36.416
Pugsley, you're okay.

22:36.500 --> 22:38.708
Uh, wha-what even happened?

22:38.791 --> 22:40.916
It was Courtney. She stopped Temeluchus.

22:41.000 --> 22:42.416
She saved everyone.

22:42.500 --> 22:43.750
Courtney? But she--

22:43.833 --> 22:47.291
Betrayed you? Abandoned you?
Left you for dead?

22:47.875 --> 22:49.500
Yeah. I know.

22:49.583 --> 22:51.958
I didn't know what I had until I didn't.

22:52.041 --> 22:54.291
I'm not expecting you to forgive me…

22:55.666 --> 22:57.166
You came home.

22:57.250 --> 22:59.916
Oh. Jeez.

23:00.000 --> 23:01.625
Come on, guys.

23:02.333 --> 23:03.583
I didn't say stop.

23:03.666 --> 23:05.916
-So what's gonna happen?

23:06.000 --> 23:07.583
Well, my shift starts in three hours.

23:07.666 --> 23:10.375
So I'm taking a power nap.

23:10.458 --> 23:12.291
I meant more conceptually,

23:12.375 --> 23:14.750
like we kind of just saved
the park right there.

23:14.833 --> 23:16.708
This is the biggest day of our lives.

23:16.791 --> 23:19.416
Is it? I thought it was Tuesday.

23:23.083 --> 23:25.041
Oh, I'll get you, my pretties.

23:25.125 --> 23:28.458
When you're least expecting it,
I'll sneak up behind you and--

23:28.541 --> 23:29.666
Who are you talking to?

23:29.750 --> 23:31.541
Excuse me--

23:33.375 --> 23:36.916
The threat was eliminated.
Demon Invasion canceled.

23:37.000 --> 23:40.083
I think these humans might be
the ones we've been looking for.

23:40.583 --> 23:44.041
Maybe it's time
those upstairs paid them a visit.
