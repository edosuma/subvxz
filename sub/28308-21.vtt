32:44.000 --> 32:47.000
Oh, yeah.

32:47.000 --> 32:49.000
If we're gonna be honest with each other,

32:49.000 --> 32:51.000
he's the star of the shit-show.

32:51.000 --> 32:52.000
Of this show? No, he's not.

32:52.000 --> 32:54.000
I'm the star. Star of the shit-show.

32:54.000 --> 32:56.000
I'm the star. I'm the star of the show.

32:56.000 --> 32:57.000
I'm the star.

32:57.000 --> 32:58.000
I always considered myself the star.

32:58.000 --> 32:59.000
Yeah?

33:00.000 --> 33:01.000
I will say that you probably are the one

33:01.000 --> 33:03.000
that would consider yourself the star.

33:06.000 --> 33:09.000
I mean, I can't go, so they're gonna go to waste anyway.

33:09.000 --> 33:11.000
Excuse me. Do you want tickets to a movie here tonight?

33:11.000 --> 33:12.000
They just gave me free tickets.

33:12.000 --> 33:13.000
I can't go. It's for tonight.

33:13.000 --> 33:16.000
Yeah, it's for 8:35 here.

33:16.000 --> 33:18.000
It's called "Escalator 2."

33:18.000 --> 33:20.000
No. It's a new movie.

33:21.000 --> 33:23.000
"The sequel to the movie where a group of strangers

33:23.000 --> 33:26.000
gets stuck on an escalator for five hours."

33:27.000 --> 33:29.000
Well, a group of strangers, in the first one,

33:29.000 --> 33:33.000
got stuck on an escalator for five hours.

33:35.000 --> 33:36.000
I'm just -- I'm now just realizing

33:37.000 --> 33:38.000
the absurdity of the movie.

33:41.000 --> 33:44.000
So, this is the sequel to "Escalator 1."

33:44.000 --> 33:46.000
If you don't like scary movies, it's not scary.

33:48.000 --> 33:51.000
If you love scary movies, it's a great horror movie.

33:53.000 --> 33:54.000
"How do you feel about escalators?"

33:54.000 --> 33:57.000
How do you feel about escalators?

33:57.000 --> 33:59.000
Yeah. Or down.

34:01.000 --> 34:03.000
"Rot L.A..."

34:03.000 --> 34:05.000
So, you're breaking down the word "escalator.

34:05.000 --> 34:06.000
Do it. Let me see.

34:06.000 --> 34:07.000
2... 2...

34:07.000 --> 34:09.000
...Rot... ...Rot...

34:09.000 --> 34:12.000
So you're making escalator an acronym backward.

34:12.000 --> 34:13.000
Okay. Let's do it.

34:13.000 --> 34:15.000
What's happening right now?

34:15.000 --> 34:16.000
Yeah.

34:18.000 --> 34:21.000
Sal, you forget that weed is legal in Los Angeles, bud.

34:21.000 --> 34:22.000
That's what's going on.

34:22.000 --> 34:25.000
2 Rot... I see down there.

34:25.000 --> 34:26.000
You got the weed socks.

34:26.000 --> 34:27.000
Yeah. I love it.

34:29.000 --> 34:30.000
Oh, really? That's a thing?

34:30.000 --> 34:31.000
Yeah.

34:31.000 --> 34:32.000
Okay, let's do it. Alright.

34:33.000 --> 34:36.000
So, "Escalator 2" backwards means "2..."

34:37.000 --> 34:42.000
To run over the angels lost after crying sadly on Earth.

34:42.000 --> 34:46.000
To run over the angels lost after crying sadly on Earth.

34:46.000 --> 34:48.000
You want them tickets or no? Yes.

34:48.000 --> 34:49.000
Oh, I'd love to. Take them.

34:52.000 --> 34:54.000
Q: This sort of wacky shit is not going on

34:54.000 --> 34:55.000
in the streets of Manhattan.

34:55.000 --> 34:57.000
Alright, boys.

34:57.000 --> 34:59.000
Sal: Alright, Q. How we feeling?

34:59.000 --> 35:00.000
-Fantastic. -Feeling good, buddy.

35:00.000 --> 35:02.000
You're on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, man.

35:02.000 --> 35:05.000
How would you describe the Hollywood Walk of Fame, Murray?

35:05.000 --> 35:06.000
Only the elite? Of course.

35:07.000 --> 35:10.000
You have to reach a certain level of prestige and power

35:10.000 --> 35:12.000
and looks and fame

35:12.000 --> 35:13.000
and grace to be on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

35:13.000 --> 35:15.000
Joe: They don't just give it to anybody.

35:13.000 --> 35:15.000
No.

35:15.000 --> 35:17.000
Huh. What's this?

35:17.000 --> 35:19.000
"Brian Quinn." [ Laughs ]

35:19.000 --> 35:21.000
Look at that!

35:21.000 --> 35:22.000
Wow!

35:23.000 --> 35:24.000
Is that a sticker? That looks so real.

35:25.000 --> 35:27.000
It's not in-line with the rest of the stars.

35:27.000 --> 35:29.000
This is the V.I.P. row over here.

35:30.000 --> 35:31.000
Your sticker doesn't quite reach

35:31.000 --> 35:32.000
all the way to the end of the concrete.

35:32.000 --> 35:35.000
It's not a  sticker. It's a  star.

35:35.000 --> 35:36.000
I don't know who half these guys are,

35:36.000 --> 35:38.000
but I know who that is, you know?

35:39.000 --> 35:41.000
Who's Brian Quinn?

35:41.000 --> 35:42.000
He was on that show

35:42.000 --> 35:43.000
"Impractical Jokers."

35:43.000 --> 35:45.000
You ever hear about him? Yeah, yeah.

35:45.000 --> 35:47.000
He was here. He was here tonight.

35:47.000 --> 35:50.000
They're actually having a movie premiere tonight.

35:50.000 --> 35:51.000
Oh.

35:51.000 --> 35:52.000
He doesn't recognize Q?

35:52.000 --> 35:54.000
Actually, they're having a movie premiere tonight

35:54.000 --> 35:56.000
with this guy in it, and they gave me two tickets.

35:56.000 --> 35:57.000
I got to leave town. Do you want the tickets?

35:58.000 --> 36:00.000
It's called "The King and Guy."

36:00.000 --> 36:03.000
"Guy Fieri plays Queen Elizabeth II

36:03.000 --> 36:06.000
in a cross-dressing drama that will leave you questioning

36:06.000 --> 36:10.000
whether monarchies are the way to go."

36:10.000 --> 36:11.000
Do you guys want tickets to this?

36:11.000 --> 36:13.000
Brian Quinn's in it.

36:13.000 --> 36:15.000
What are you talking about, "you don't want"...

36:18.000 --> 36:21.000
Guy Fieri, the chef, plays Queen...

36:21.000 --> 36:23.000
Yeah, he's gonna be here with Brian Quinn.

36:24.000 --> 36:27.000
Carol, you want to go, right? Carol's in.

36:27.000 --> 36:28.000
Come on. Date night.

36:28.000 --> 36:30.000
How many movie premieres do you get to go see?

36:30.000 --> 36:32.000
You get to meet Brian Quinn!

36:33.000 --> 36:35.000
I think you should take them.

36:35.000 --> 36:36.000
Well, you try and see what happens.

36:36.000 --> 36:37.000
Alright. Enjoy the movie, man.

36:37.000 --> 36:38.000
Nice to see you.

36:38.000 --> 36:40.000
Yeah! Hey!

36:40.000 --> 36:41.000
It's called star power, guys.

36:41.000 --> 36:42.000
[ Ding! ]

36:43.000 --> 36:44.000
Star power.

36:44.000 --> 36:47.000
-Joey! -Okay.

36:47.000 --> 36:49.000
Alright, well, if we can't go, we can't go.

36:49.000 --> 36:51.000
Thanks.

36:51.000 --> 36:53.000
Hey. I got two tickets I can't use.

36:53.000 --> 36:54.000
Would you like these, bud?

36:54.000 --> 36:55.000
They're for a movie premiere here tonight.

36:55.000 --> 36:57.000
You could see -- I don't want anything for them.

36:57.000 --> 37:00.000
My plans changed. I'm going back to New York.

37:00.000 --> 37:01.000
Oh, you don't care?

37:02.000 --> 37:05.000
Well, I appreciate the honesty about that.

37:05.000 --> 37:06.000
Yeah, no, that's fine if you don't care about it,

37:06.000 --> 37:07.000
but they were just two tickets.

37:07.000 --> 37:08.000
I didn't want them to go to waste.

37:08.000 --> 37:10.000
But if you don't give a shit, you don't give a shit.

37:10.000 --> 37:11.000
It's fine.

37:11.000 --> 37:13.000
Enjoy your day, pal.

37:13.000 --> 37:14.000
Breaking news -- I don't care.

37:15.000 --> 37:17.000
I love it. I love him!

37:17.000 --> 37:19.000
How's it going? Yeah, that's gonna work.

37:19.000 --> 37:20.000
Fantastic.

37:20.000 --> 37:23.000
[ Laughter ]

37:23.000 --> 37:26.000
Her eyes said a million things at once.

37:26.000 --> 37:27.000
Before he even engaged.

37:27.000 --> 37:29.000
She was like, "This happens to me every minute."

37:29.000 --> 37:30.000
I mean, they're free movie tickets.

37:30.000 --> 37:31.000
What am I gonna do?

37:31.000 --> 37:33.000
Alright. I'll call you later.

37:33.000 --> 37:34.000
Hi. Oh, yeah.

37:35.000 --> 37:37.000
I can't make the premiere. It's a premiere tonight.

37:37.000 --> 37:38.000
Are you interested for sure?

37:38.000 --> 37:41.000
It's a movie tonight that's playing at the theater,

37:41.000 --> 37:42.000
but I have to go back to New York.

37:42.000 --> 37:44.000
It's called "2 Brothers, 1 Horse."

37:44.000 --> 37:48.000
"Two brothers lost in a desert with a single horse.

37:48.000 --> 37:49.000
One brother wants to ride it.

37:50.000 --> 37:51.000
The other wants to eat it.

37:51.000 --> 37:53.000
What happens next will shock you."

37:56.000 --> 37:58.000
"2 Brothers, 1 Horse."

37:58.000 --> 37:59.000
They don't know what to do with the horse.

38:00.000 --> 38:02.000
Joe, Joe, just keep saying "shocking."

38:02.000 --> 38:03.000
What they'll do will shock you,

38:03.000 --> 38:04.000
so I don't want you to miss out on it.

38:05.000 --> 38:06.000
Okay. But there's only two tickets,

38:06.000 --> 38:08.000
so they'll have to tell you what happens.

38:08.000 --> 38:10.000
It will shock you. Yeah.

38:10.000 --> 38:11.000
So, what we'll do is shock you.

38:11.000 --> 38:12.000
It's for free. Take it.

38:13.000 --> 38:14.000
Take the whole thing. There you go.

38:14.000 --> 38:15.000
I don't need anything.

38:15.000 --> 38:16.000
Wow, Joe!

38:16.000 --> 38:18.000
[ Ding! ]

38:18.000 --> 38:19.000
You got lucky on this one.

38:19.000 --> 38:21.000
Murr's up.

38:21.000 --> 38:22.000
Okay, I'll just give them -- Guys, do you want these tickets?

38:22.000 --> 38:23.000
They're free.

38:24.000 --> 38:26.000
I don't want -- I can't go to the premiere tonight.

38:27.000 --> 38:29.000
It's for a movie. I don't want any money for it.

38:29.000 --> 38:30.000
I just don't want them to go to waste.

38:30.000 --> 38:32.000
They just gave me the tickets.

38:32.000 --> 38:33.000
It's "Prostitute Woman."

38:36.000 --> 38:39.000
"An unsuccessful businessman needs a date for a social event,

38:39.000 --> 38:43.000
so he hires a prostitute that he meets, only to fall in love."

38:43.000 --> 38:46.000
You know, the plot sounds familiar to me.

38:46.000 --> 38:47.000
Starring Julie Robert.

38:47.000 --> 38:50.000
Yeah, I heard she has a heart of bronze.

38:52.000 --> 38:53.000
Nice try, buddy.

38:53.000 --> 38:55.000
Guys, one more shot, please.

38:55.000 --> 38:57.000
Come on. -Sure.

38:57.000 --> 38:58.000
Yep, get another envelope. Thank you.

38:59.000 --> 39:01.000
Alright. Alright, here we go.

39:01.000 --> 39:02.000
Dude, do you want these tickets? They're free.

39:02.000 --> 39:03.000
I don't want them. I can't use them today.

39:04.000 --> 39:05.000
I got to fly back early.

39:05.000 --> 39:08.000
They just gave me these movie tickets for a premiere.

39:08.000 --> 39:10.000
It's for "Lions and Tigers and Chairs."

39:10.000 --> 39:12.000
It's a documentary about lion tamers,

39:12.000 --> 39:14.000
but it's just dudes getting shredded

39:14.000 --> 39:16.000
by big cats for 59 minutes.

39:16.000 --> 39:18.000
They had to keep it under an hour

39:18.000 --> 39:20.000
or it would legally be audience assault.

39:22.000 --> 39:24.000
So, just take it. Do you want it?

39:24.000 --> 39:25.000
You won't benefit from it? Yeah.

39:25.000 --> 39:27.000
Neither will Murray, unfortunately.

39:27.000 --> 39:28.000
Joe: Oh, Murr. 0 for 2.

39:28.000 --> 39:32.000
Guys, guys, best out of 3? Please?

39:32.000 --> 39:33.000
He's already 0 for 2. Sure.

39:33.000 --> 39:35.000
Yeah, sure, best out of 3. Best out of 3.

39:35.000 --> 39:37.000
Do you know how to do math, you stupid moron?

39:38.000 --> 39:39.000
You already lost two.

39:39.000 --> 39:40.000
Did you want these?

39:40.000 --> 39:41.000
They're free tickets. I can't use them.

39:41.000 --> 39:43.000
I've got to fly home earlier than I thought.

39:43.000 --> 39:44.000
I don't want them to go to waste.

39:44.000 --> 39:45.000
They just gave them to me.

39:45.000 --> 39:49.000
The movie is "My [Bleep] Ate My Balls."

39:49.000 --> 39:50.000
"My [Bleep] Ate My Balls."

39:50.000 --> 39:51.000
It's a big premiere tonight.

39:53.000 --> 39:56.000
It's about 137 of the world's greatest animators

39:56.000 --> 40:02.000
and puppeteers spend $69 million over a span of 13 years

40:02.000 --> 40:04.000
to create this sexual horror mystery

40:04.000 --> 40:09.000
based on a true story about Babe Ruth's weirdo cousin."

40:12.000 --> 40:13.000
Just take it. I don't want them to go to waste.

40:13.000 --> 40:14.000
Uh... Yeah, you want it?

40:14.000 --> 40:16.000
It's a big premiere tonight. You got me on the puppets.

40:16.000 --> 40:17.000
I'll do the puppets. The puppets?

40:17.000 --> 40:18.000
The puppets. The puppets is the one --

40:18.000 --> 40:19.000
Take it, enjoy it.

40:19.000 --> 40:21.000
-Oh! -You got it, bud.

40:21.000 --> 40:22.000
Enjoy.

40:22.000 --> 40:24.000
Q: Yeah, hey, Murr, good job, buddy.

40:24.000 --> 40:26.000
So, you realize what just happened.

40:26.000 --> 40:28.000
Yes. We give you 2 out of 3.

40:28.000 --> 40:30.000
Yes. Yeah, you lost 2.

40:30.000 --> 40:32.000
You only got one. So you still lose.

ate your balls right there.

Narrator: That's a wrap on Murr.

40:42.000 --> 40:45.000
He's tonight's big loser.

40:47.000 --> 40:49.000
This is the end of our 200th episode,

40:49.000 --> 40:51.000
and the loser is not me.

40:51.000 --> 40:53.000
It is Murr. What is this?

What's going on? For your punishment,

we have thrown a party that cannot be beat.
