00:00.419 --> 00:01.644
Previously on "Heartland"...

00:01.664 --> 00:03.164
Your mom's a grown woman.

00:03.184 --> 00:05.367
She's the only one who can
get herself out of this.

00:05.387 --> 00:07.694
I got her in the best rehab I could find.

00:07.714 --> 00:08.906
I'm gonna go see her in a couple days.

00:08.941 --> 00:10.827
I'll let you know how she's doing.

00:10.847 --> 00:14.895
I've decided that it's time for
me to give back to the rodeo world.

00:14.915 --> 00:17.048
I'm starting a rodeo school
right here in Hudson.

00:17.082 --> 00:19.251
- I support this.
- Thanks, buddy.

00:19.285 --> 00:20.852
Plus those kids are gonna eat you alive

00:20.886 --> 00:23.187
and I definitely support that.

00:23.221 --> 00:24.656
There it is. Thank you.

00:24.690 --> 00:26.423
- Ungh!
- What the hell?

00:26.458 --> 00:28.292
- Jade!
- Oh!

00:28.326 --> 00:31.262
- Ungh!
- Jade? Jade!

00:32.162 --> 00:34.781
Beat that, boys!

Hey, Wade.

00:54.353 --> 00:57.187
Next week? Uh...

00:57.221 --> 00:59.289
Well, it's a little short notice.

01:02.931 --> 01:05.595
Okay. Um...

01:06.003 --> 01:07.998
Yeah, I'll see what I can do.

01:08.443 --> 01:10.754
Okay. Talk to you soon.

01:19.142 --> 01:20.510
Hey. You ready to go?

01:20.544 --> 01:24.614
Yeah... you okay?

01:24.648 --> 01:26.948
Yeah, yeah. I'm fine, I just uh...

01:26.983 --> 01:27.983
What- what're you watching?

01:28.018 --> 01:30.085
Oh, you gotta check this out.

01:30.120 --> 01:32.454
...is my favourite
part of the great plains relay.

01:32.489 --> 01:33.755
Here they go,
'round the bend.

01:33.789 --> 01:35.991
Huh.
Is one of those guys Scott's nephew?

01:36.026 --> 01:38.081
No. I'm just watching
whatever I can find online.

01:38.101 --> 01:40.935
I thought I better see what the great
plains relay actually looks like.

01:40.955 --> 01:41.877
What're they doing?

01:41.897 --> 01:44.270
This the transition zone,
where they switch horses.

01:44.290 --> 01:46.668
Looks like complete chaos.

01:46.702 --> 01:48.737
Whoa! Well, that was incredible.

01:48.771 --> 01:51.873
When it works. Watch this guy.

01:51.908 --> 01:54.275
Oh, geez, come on, buddy! Hold on.

01:54.309 --> 01:55.677
...see that transition? They must have
been working on that for a year...

01:55.711 --> 01:57.311
Come on.
Come on, you got it, you got it!

01:57.346 --> 01:59.180
- ...so smooth.
- Oh! Ouch!

01:59.214 --> 02:01.916
Yeah, it's totally crazy.

02:01.950 --> 02:02.958
He's right off!

02:02.978 --> 02:04.318
Wow,
I can't believe Scott used to do this.

02:04.353 --> 02:06.654
I know, right?

02:06.688 --> 02:07.755
So you think you can help his nephew?

02:07.789 --> 02:09.490
I hope so.

02:09.525 --> 02:11.092
Scott says he's having
trouble with the exchange.

02:11.126 --> 02:14.062
Yeah, well, I don't blame him.

02:14.096 --> 02:16.697
Oh, wow. Okay.
Come on. Let's go.

02:18.533 --> 02:20.100
Oh, he's here!
And you know what he likes to do.

02:20.134 --> 02:21.035
- Tickle!
- Yeah!

02:21.069 --> 02:23.070
It's open.

02:23.104 --> 02:25.573
Oh, he's coming! You better run, Katie!

02:25.607 --> 02:27.274
Jade! What're you doing here?

02:27.308 --> 02:28.842
Nice to see you too.

02:28.877 --> 02:30.364
I was just taking my new car for a cruise,

02:30.384 --> 02:31.745
thought I'd drop by.

02:31.780 --> 02:34.067
What a coincidence,
exactly when he's supposed to get here.

02:34.087 --> 02:36.349
He? Who's "he"?

02:36.384 --> 02:38.585
Give it up, Jade.
You know exactly who's coming.

02:38.619 --> 02:40.653
- Is that today?
- Nice try.

02:40.688 --> 02:42.055
But I don't want you hanging
around and drooling all over him.

02:42.090 --> 02:44.191
Oh, please.

02:44.225 --> 02:46.526
- Hello?!
- Jeffie!

02:46.561 --> 02:48.462
- Hi!
- Jeffie!

02:48.496 --> 02:50.196
Ooh, Katie - and you!

02:50.230 --> 02:52.398
- Hi.
- Hi.

02:52.432 --> 02:54.300
- I'm Jade.
- She likes to drool.

02:58.138 --> 02:59.005
- Whoa, Barega!
- Hmph! Ungh!

02:59.039 --> 03:00.907
Somebody grab him.

03:00.941 --> 03:03.409
Emmett, you all right?

03:03.443 --> 03:04.877
I'm so sick of
screwing this up for everybody.

03:04.912 --> 03:07.213
Hey, it's a team sport.

03:07.247 --> 03:10.649
Yeah, and I'm the weak link.

03:10.683 --> 03:14.353
C'mon, let's go back and
try the exchange one more time.

03:14.387 --> 03:17.323
- I'm done.
- Fine. We'll call it a day.

03:17.357 --> 03:19.891
No. I mean for good.

03:19.926 --> 03:22.160
I'm quitting the relay.

03:26.626 --> 03:30.395

04:10.642 --> 04:13.510
Emmett,
these are a couple of friends.

04:13.545 --> 04:15.445
- Amy and Ty.
- Hi.

04:15.480 --> 04:17.481
Amy works with horses.

04:17.515 --> 04:19.882
She might be able to help
you with your problem.

04:19.916 --> 04:22.052
- It's already fixed.
- Come on, you can't quit now.

04:22.086 --> 04:23.953
Finals are only a week away.

04:23.988 --> 04:25.722
And cause another wreck?

04:25.756 --> 04:26.923
I'm gonna get somebody killed out there.

04:26.957 --> 04:28.624
Emmett, what happened?

04:32.270 --> 04:34.664
I don't know.
My legs are all spaghetti

04:34.699 --> 04:37.567
by the time I make the last exchange.

04:37.601 --> 04:39.602
I just can't get up on the horse clean.

04:39.636 --> 04:40.937
It's always the same horse?

04:40.971 --> 04:43.272
Yeah. Barega.

04:43.307 --> 04:45.708
She's the fastest on the circuit,

04:46.203 --> 04:48.143
but she's wasted on me.

04:48.178 --> 04:50.246
Well, like Scott said,
I'd be happy to give you a hand.

04:50.280 --> 04:52.715
What do you know about the relay?

04:52.749 --> 04:55.284
She knows enough about horses,
and riders,

04:55.319 --> 04:58.254
that she might be able to
help you get through this.

04:58.288 --> 05:00.055
Sure. You wanna waste your time,

05:00.090 --> 05:02.765
makes no difference to me.

05:05.795 --> 05:07.001
I'm gonna go talk to Scott for a bit.

05:07.021 --> 05:09.465
- I'll be right back.
- Okay.

05:11.534 --> 05:13.535
Hey, Scott.

05:13.569 --> 05:15.104
Hey, so you'll help out tomorrow?

05:15.138 --> 05:17.372
Yeah. Yeah, I'll be here.

05:17.406 --> 05:19.874
Um... things are pretty crazy
at the clinic next week, huh?

05:19.908 --> 05:21.776
No different than usual.

05:21.810 --> 05:23.645
Well, I mean, we got a couple of surgeries,

05:23.679 --> 05:25.580
and a ton of field calls, and...

05:25.615 --> 05:27.115
That big shipment of supplies coming in,
right?

05:27.149 --> 05:29.563
Ty, what are you getting at?

05:30.453 --> 05:32.153
Uh... it's nothing. I was just...

05:32.187 --> 05:33.555
thinking about going to see my mom,

05:33.589 --> 05:35.456
but, you know, it's bad timing, so.

05:35.490 --> 05:40.067
Ty. Go see your mom. We'll be fine.

05:41.029 --> 05:43.554
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

05:43.939 --> 05:45.767
Okay. Thanks.

05:51.220 --> 05:54.441
Well! Look who's back.
The pride of Fort Mac.

05:54.476 --> 05:56.042
- Hi, I'm Casey.
- Jeff. Georgie's brother.

05:56.077 --> 05:57.678
Nice to meet you.

05:57.712 --> 06:00.414
Oh, sorry we're late.

06:00.448 --> 06:02.549
I had to sort out Tim's
rodeo school schedule.

06:02.584 --> 06:04.685
He's got himself double
booked all over the place.

06:04.719 --> 06:07.654
What can I say,
I'm a big picture kind of guy.

06:07.688 --> 06:10.757
Yeah? Is that why you added
private lessons into the mix?

06:10.792 --> 06:13.160
Private lessons?
What kind of private lessons?

06:13.194 --> 06:15.428
Oh, some rich oil guy's kid.

06:15.462 --> 06:16.963
I thought you were only interested
in serious up and comers?

06:16.998 --> 06:18.965
- Like you?
- Yeah.

06:19.000 --> 06:21.034
You know, I rode a bronc.

06:21.068 --> 06:23.403
I have not problem coaching some wannabe

06:23.437 --> 06:25.871
if his dad's gonna throw
sponsorship money my way.

06:25.906 --> 06:27.433
But, dad,
how are you gonna manage this?

06:27.453 --> 06:28.675
It's just you and Caleb.

06:28.709 --> 06:31.243
Caleb? Pfft!
Kid's on the road twenty-four-seven.

06:31.278 --> 06:32.533
Well,
Jesse's been riding him pretty hard

06:32.553 --> 06:34.010
to find some new stock, so.

06:34.030 --> 06:35.281
Caleb is useless to me.

06:35.316 --> 06:36.582
Well, Jack could help out.

06:36.617 --> 06:38.884
He's got some serious rodeo cred.

06:38.919 --> 06:42.654
I'm not interested in training the
next generation of weekend cowboys.

06:42.689 --> 06:45.858
But if you need a hand
with those real rodeo kids

06:45.892 --> 06:48.294
I would consider pitching in.

06:48.328 --> 06:49.995
Yeah, those kids'd be saying,
when was that guy's last rodeo?

06:50.030 --> 06:52.631
When they were bucking dinosaurs?

06:52.665 --> 06:54.633
This coming
from a guy who won his last buckle

06:54.667 --> 06:57.135
before these kids were even born.

06:57.169 --> 06:59.304
So you still raking in the cash up north?

06:59.339 --> 07:02.474
Yeah. Same 'ol, same 'ol.

07:02.508 --> 07:05.176
Come on, Jeff,
tell 'em about your big promotion!

07:05.864 --> 07:07.446
Honestly, it's no big deal.

07:07.480 --> 07:08.814
No big deal?
He's running his own crew...

07:08.848 --> 07:11.916
Uh, Georgie, just... Let it go.

07:11.951 --> 07:13.351
I mean, come on,
no one wants to hear a bunch of...

07:13.385 --> 07:15.585
boring work talk, right?

07:15.771 --> 07:17.719
Cute and modest.

07:20.893 --> 07:22.471
So I'll pick you up on
my way to the track tomorrow?

07:22.491 --> 07:23.985
Yeah, that sounds great.

07:24.005 --> 07:26.965
It should be an interesting session.

07:26.999 --> 07:28.933
Yeah.
Emmett doesn't seem too keen, does he?

07:28.968 --> 07:31.133
No. That's an understatement.

07:31.153 --> 07:32.441
Hmm.

07:32.850 --> 07:35.382
Hey... you okay?

07:36.641 --> 07:38.141
That's the second time
you've asked me that today.

07:38.176 --> 07:40.478
Well, it's just...
You seem a little bit more...

07:40.512 --> 07:42.480
up in your head than normal.

07:43.414 --> 07:44.930
Uh...

07:46.419 --> 07:47.550
Wa...

07:47.859 --> 07:50.720
Wade called me this morning and um...

07:50.755 --> 07:52.356
Family day at the clinic is next week.

07:52.390 --> 07:54.158
You gonna go see your mom?

07:54.178 --> 07:56.260
Yeah...

07:56.294 --> 07:59.303
I was kinda hoping Scott
wouldn't give me the time off.

08:01.232 --> 08:03.400
I hate going to those places, Amy.

08:03.960 --> 08:06.653
She must be happy you're coming.

08:07.204 --> 08:09.606
Yeah, well,
she doesn't really know quite yet.

08:09.640 --> 08:11.808
I have to call Wade first
thing in the morning.

08:12.597 --> 08:15.512
It'll be okay.

08:15.546 --> 08:16.746
Good night.

08:16.781 --> 08:18.763
Good night.

08:28.129 --> 08:29.025
Ungh!

08:29.668 --> 08:30.826
And again.

08:31.405 --> 08:32.832
Ungh.

08:39.101 --> 08:40.890
- Ungh!
- Nice! Okay.

08:40.910 --> 08:42.380
One more time. One more time.

08:42.400 --> 08:44.773
Ugh! Haven't you seen enough? I'm beat.

08:44.808 --> 08:47.342
Sorta like you are on the final exchange.

08:47.376 --> 08:49.545
But you're landing this
perfectly every time.

08:49.579 --> 08:51.580
Barega's staying good and still too.

08:51.614 --> 08:53.848
So far, you guys are totally in sync.

08:53.882 --> 08:56.757
I don't see anything that would
cause you to miss in the exchange.

08:58.743 --> 09:00.255
So what's next?

09:00.289 --> 09:02.478
Let's try it for real.

09:04.093 --> 09:07.095
Easy, Barega.
Easy. Easy...

09:07.129 --> 09:08.996
Okay, Emmett, bring him in.

09:09.030 --> 09:11.031
Yah!

09:11.066 --> 09:13.167
Whoa, whoa. Hey, hey, hey. Easy.

09:13.201 --> 09:15.536
Easy now! Come on!

09:20.175 --> 09:21.809
Whoa, whoa!
Emmett!

09:21.844 --> 09:24.545
Emmett, are you okay?

09:24.580 --> 09:26.013
Why can't I land it?!

09:26.047 --> 09:27.982
You can't be so hard on yourself.

09:28.016 --> 09:30.094
I keep choking under the pressure.

09:30.114 --> 09:32.750
No! No, it's not you.

09:32.770 --> 09:35.786
It's your horse. It's Barega.

09:48.168 --> 09:50.436
Hey! So guess who just got approved

09:50.471 --> 09:53.940
for a whole series of clinics
at the high school rodeos.

09:53.975 --> 09:56.676
Well, good for you.

09:56.711 --> 09:59.512
So what did you want to
talk to me about then?

09:59.546 --> 10:01.847
Oh. I've been thinking about your offer.

10:01.882 --> 10:06.552
- My offer?
- To help lighten my workload.

10:06.586 --> 10:09.422
Well, I thought I was...
too prehistoric

10:09.456 --> 10:11.190
to work at your rodeo school.

10:11.225 --> 10:13.359
Agh! And I know Casey's been joking

10:13.394 --> 10:14.927
about how disorganized I am,

10:14.961 --> 10:17.229
but I got it all worked out.

10:17.263 --> 10:19.632
No, no. I need help with Maggie's.

10:19.666 --> 10:21.901
- M-Maggie's?
- Well, Lou's still away.

10:21.935 --> 10:24.069
The place won't run itself.

10:24.103 --> 10:28.040
You want me to work at the diner?

10:28.060 --> 10:30.375
I need a watch dog.

10:31.358 --> 10:33.011
No.

10:33.504 --> 10:36.346
I-I need someone to oversee it.

10:38.418 --> 10:40.152
Make sure things are running smoothly.

10:44.290 --> 10:46.658
You did everything right.

10:46.692 --> 10:49.493
Your dismount was clean,
and your approach was great.

10:49.528 --> 10:51.280
Then why did I end up back in the dirt?

10:51.300 --> 10:52.630
Because Barega took off too soon.

10:52.665 --> 10:54.365
Yeah, I couldn't even hold her back.

10:54.399 --> 10:57.535
She sees the other horses lined up
and she knows what's coming.

10:57.570 --> 11:00.205
Barega loves to run so much
that you can't hold her back.

11:00.225 --> 11:01.973
She just takes off.

11:02.007 --> 11:04.625
This is good news. Now that we know
what the issue is we can deal with it.

11:04.645 --> 11:06.784
How? She's a gamer.

11:06.804 --> 11:08.819
That's what makes her so good.

11:08.839 --> 11:11.090
We can't take the race out of the horse.

11:11.110 --> 11:12.749
Maybe you start the relay on her...

11:12.784 --> 11:15.088
And that way you don't have
to jump on Barega at all.

11:15.108 --> 11:16.687
No. Barega runs anchor.

11:16.721 --> 11:19.090
Your best horse always runs the last lap.

11:19.124 --> 11:22.223
Since you know everything,
what do you think we should do?

11:23.441 --> 11:25.195
Take off your jacket.

11:25.229 --> 11:27.033
- What?
- I think I might have a way

11:27.053 --> 11:29.994
to hold Barega back in the exchange.

11:30.602 --> 11:32.778
You really think this is gonna work?

11:32.798 --> 11:35.083
Let her smell it first.

11:37.763 --> 11:39.309
There you. Hey...

11:39.343 --> 11:41.677
Easy now...
I'm just gonna put this over your head.

11:41.712 --> 11:45.081
Really slowly... Just like that.

11:45.116 --> 11:46.349
Okay, we're ready!

11:46.383 --> 11:48.179
Yah!

11:50.354 --> 11:52.522
Okay, wait for it...

11:52.556 --> 11:54.323
Now!

11:55.726 --> 11:57.693
Yes!

11:57.728 --> 12:00.964
- That's it!
- Woo! Nice exchange!

12:05.417 --> 12:08.656
Well, you finally got him out of bed.

12:08.792 --> 12:10.994
It's nice to be able to...
sleep in for once.

12:11.028 --> 12:12.862
I thought you packed it in
right after dinner last night?

12:12.896 --> 12:14.430
Ah, must be the country air.

12:16.233 --> 12:19.301
So what do you two have planned for today?

12:19.336 --> 12:22.738
Well, she's abandoning me
for some trick riding practice.

12:22.772 --> 12:24.673
Well, I told you, I could skip it.

12:24.707 --> 12:27.543
Have fun, whatever it is.

12:27.577 --> 12:30.006
No, that's fine.
I'll hang out here until you get back.

12:30.026 --> 12:31.502
Really?

12:31.775 --> 12:33.348
Yeah... what?

12:33.382 --> 12:36.584
Well, don't you usually go rent exotic cars

12:36.619 --> 12:39.988
and... rip around on your motorcycle?

12:40.023 --> 12:42.524
I guess I've mellowed in my old age.

12:46.793 --> 12:48.729
Oh, look who it is.

12:48.764 --> 12:50.831
Just happened to be in the neighborhood?

12:50.866 --> 12:52.733
Uh,
I just left my jacket here last night.

12:52.768 --> 12:54.654
- Of course you did.
- Hey, Jeff.

12:54.674 --> 12:56.267
- Hey.
- Nice hair.

12:56.287 --> 12:57.705
Yeah, barn loft special.

12:59.041 --> 13:01.042
Don't you have somewhere to be?

13:01.076 --> 13:03.044
No. Actually, I'm gonna go to
this arts and music festival.

13:03.078 --> 13:05.412
I thought you might wanna go.

13:05.446 --> 13:08.378
Uh...
yeah, I got a little free time on my hands.

13:08.398 --> 13:10.272
- Why not?
- Cool.

13:11.786 --> 13:14.516
Well, I better run a
comb through this though, huh?

13:19.598 --> 13:21.199
Okay.

13:23.764 --> 13:26.333
Well, I can't believe what a
difference that made. That was great.

13:26.367 --> 13:29.336
Yeah,
the exchange was perfect every time.

13:29.370 --> 13:32.138
But Emmett's team can't be using
your jacket during the race.

13:32.173 --> 13:33.373
No, that's why we'll use blinders

13:33.408 --> 13:35.576
for the real thing, right?

13:35.610 --> 13:38.178
That'll block out all the craziness
that's happening around her.

13:38.212 --> 13:40.546
Well, looks like you're back
on track for the championships.

13:40.581 --> 13:42.182
Hey, good luck at the finals.

13:42.216 --> 13:45.451
And you... You wait for him, okay?

13:45.485 --> 13:47.401
All right, take care.

13:47.421 --> 13:49.222
See ya, guys.

13:49.256 --> 13:51.191
You're not gonna thank her?

13:51.225 --> 13:53.059
For putting a jacket over her head?

13:53.094 --> 13:54.860
She just saved your butt.

13:54.894 --> 13:56.795
You could win this whole thing.

13:56.830 --> 13:59.164
That's what everyone
keeps saying back home.

13:59.670 --> 14:02.368
They want me to be a champion,
like you were.

14:02.998 --> 14:05.170
But nobody cares what I want.

14:05.765 --> 14:07.594
And what would that be?

14:07.614 --> 14:10.642
I already told you. You weren't listening.

14:11.089 --> 14:12.444
I wanna quit.

14:12.478 --> 14:15.013
I'm leaving the reservation.

14:16.006 --> 14:18.178
To go where?

14:19.741 --> 14:22.554
Moving to the city, like you did.

14:31.730 --> 14:33.031
Ha! He just said, "no," then he...

14:33.065 --> 14:35.266
he drove off in a huff.

14:35.300 --> 14:38.136
Really? That doesn't sound like Jack.

14:38.170 --> 14:40.204
I mean, he's the one who offered
to help in the first place.

14:40.238 --> 14:43.274
Yeah, and I really need help at Maggie's.

14:43.308 --> 14:47.378
Maggie's? Are you kidding me?

14:47.412 --> 14:50.013
What? I didn't ask him to wait tables.

14:50.048 --> 14:52.216
I asked him to watch over the place.

14:52.250 --> 14:54.418
See right here?

14:54.452 --> 14:56.776
These are the famous Tim
Fleming people skills at work.

14:56.796 --> 14:57.761
What does that mean?

14:57.781 --> 15:00.391
It means
I don't why you're trying to push him away.

15:00.425 --> 15:01.591
You just took on all
these high school rodeos,

15:01.625 --> 15:03.160
you could use Jack's help here.

15:03.194 --> 15:07.138
I have got it under control.

15:07.999 --> 15:10.200
I've even carved out a little Casey time...

15:10.234 --> 15:11.568
- Yeah?
- Yeah, you and me,

15:11.602 --> 15:14.171
we're going fly fishing, tomorrow.

15:14.205 --> 15:17.873
You can't afford to take a day off,
mister.

15:17.908 --> 15:20.776
You know what they say?
All work and no play...

15:20.811 --> 15:22.645
- Please!
- Come here.

15:22.680 --> 15:24.780
Woo!

15:33.076 --> 15:35.891
- Hey!
- Oh, hey. You're back early.

15:35.926 --> 15:38.260
Yeah, the bands were pretty lame.

15:38.294 --> 15:39.962
This your new horse?

15:39.996 --> 15:41.931
Yeah, yeah, Checkers.

15:41.965 --> 15:44.033
Phoenix must be all jealous.

15:44.067 --> 15:47.569
Well, as long as there's someone
to jump him, he's pretty happy.

15:47.604 --> 15:49.488
My friend Stephen's helping out with that.

15:49.508 --> 15:51.406
Stephen, huh?

15:51.441 --> 15:53.727
How good a friend we talking here?

15:55.278 --> 15:57.178
Really? This guy's your... boyfriend?

15:57.213 --> 16:00.029
No. He's not my boyfriend.

16:00.049 --> 16:01.450
All right.

16:01.484 --> 16:03.619
So... Jade, what do you think of her?

16:03.653 --> 16:05.287
Yeah, she seemed pretty cool for a...

16:05.321 --> 16:07.455
one of those university types.

16:07.489 --> 16:09.257
- University?
- Yeah, she was going on

16:09.291 --> 16:11.559
about her classes at the U of C,

16:11.593 --> 16:14.729
but... I can never understand
why people blow their cash

16:14.764 --> 16:19.768
on philosophy courses and basket weaving

16:19.802 --> 16:23.204
when... they could all be
making money in the real world.

16:23.239 --> 16:25.072
Hmm.

16:25.106 --> 16:26.840
What?

16:26.875 --> 16:28.609
Nothing.

16:28.644 --> 16:30.627
Come on, Georgie, what's wrong?

16:30.647 --> 16:32.613
Just...

16:32.648 --> 16:35.710
I hate when people pretend
to be something they're not.

16:38.687 --> 16:40.825
I guess you know your
brother pretty well by now.

16:40.845 --> 16:42.923
Uh... yeah, I guess.

16:42.957 --> 16:46.541
You're probably wondering why
I've been acting so strange?

16:46.561 --> 16:48.896
Well, yeah. You have been acting
a little different lately.

16:48.930 --> 16:51.498
Well, the truth is...

16:54.828 --> 16:57.671
I... I got fired.

16:57.705 --> 16:59.372
- Fired?
- Don't worry, I'll-I'll be fine.

16:59.407 --> 17:03.643
But I don't really wanna get into it,

17:03.678 --> 17:07.480
so I'd prefer if you didn't tell anyone,
okay?

17:07.515 --> 17:09.449
'Kay.

17:13.921 --> 17:17.388
Hello, Georgie!

17:17.424 --> 17:20.575
Oh, you're not talking. You all right?

17:21.021 --> 17:23.195
Yeah.

17:23.230 --> 17:26.238
Actually, no. No, I'm not.

17:26.258 --> 17:29.113
Well, what's wrong?

17:29.133 --> 17:31.136
Well, you know when you think
things are going a certain way,

17:31.170 --> 17:34.883
but... then you find out
they're the exact opposite?

17:34.903 --> 17:37.484
Mm... what happened?

17:41.207 --> 17:43.508
Um... I'm sorry, Jack.

17:44.217 --> 17:45.908
I can't... I can't say anything.

17:45.928 --> 17:47.777
I'm sorry.

17:56.495 --> 17:58.129
Well, you did great out there, Amy.

17:58.164 --> 17:59.697
I couldn't have done
it without your jacket.

18:02.401 --> 18:03.508
- See ya.
- Okay.

18:03.528 --> 18:05.703
Oh, hey!
Did you talk to Wade this morning

18:05.723 --> 18:08.310
and tell him you can make it to family day?

18:08.807 --> 18:10.274
Uh... not yet.

18:10.308 --> 18:12.480
I thought you were gonna
call him first thing?

18:12.691 --> 18:15.783
I know. Um... I will... do it.

18:16.281 --> 18:18.811
Why don't you just tell me what's going on?

18:20.418 --> 18:23.520
Amy, I just don't like those places,
all right? So...

18:29.612 --> 18:31.672
I'm listening.

18:34.866 --> 18:37.701
All right. Um...

18:37.735 --> 18:40.888
I haven't been able to sleep
the last couple of days.

18:40.908 --> 18:43.239
I uh...

18:43.274 --> 18:45.409
I can't get these memories out of my head.

18:46.181 --> 18:47.878
Memories...

18:47.912 --> 18:50.219
Like visiting your mom in rehab?

18:50.239 --> 18:52.415
Yeah.

18:53.180 --> 18:56.485
First time, I was... eight years old

18:56.520 --> 18:59.437
and I didn't even know what the place was.

19:01.591 --> 19:05.456
My mom was so sick, um,
I thought she was dying.

19:06.604 --> 19:08.689
I can't even imagine.

19:09.235 --> 19:11.333
Yeah...

19:11.367 --> 19:15.638
When I got older,
I thought she was doing it to herself...

19:15.899 --> 19:18.565
And there was nothing I could do about it.

19:20.414 --> 19:23.278
Truth is, there still isn't, so...

19:24.063 --> 19:26.408
I'm gonna go with you.

19:27.735 --> 19:29.303
Amy, that's... that's not the point.

19:29.323 --> 19:31.320
- I'm not...
- Yeah, yes, it is.

19:31.354 --> 19:35.424
You have a different life now,
Ty, and I am a part of it.

19:35.458 --> 19:40.035
So I'm gonna face this with you, okay?

20:04.535 --> 20:07.497
Hey, Wade. It- yeah, I'm good.

20:07.517 --> 20:09.784
Listen, about next week.

20:09.804 --> 20:12.074
It looks like Amy and I will
both be able to come out, so-

20:15.853 --> 20:17.540
Uh... okay.

20:18.114 --> 20:20.010
Are you sure?

20:23.968 --> 20:25.020
Oh.

20:25.619 --> 20:26.996
Uh...

20:28.758 --> 20:31.038
Thanks for letting me know.

20:31.794 --> 20:33.094
Okay. Bye.

20:38.400 --> 20:40.089
- Good morning.
- Hey.

20:40.109 --> 20:41.736
Field call?

20:41.771 --> 20:44.820
Yeah, it won't be long though.

20:45.527 --> 20:49.377
So, uh, it turns out I won't
need that time off after all.

20:49.697 --> 20:51.712
I told you we'd be fine.

20:51.746 --> 20:54.482
I know. Just a... change of plans.

20:56.585 --> 21:00.187
So, uh, how's Emmett doing?

21:00.221 --> 21:03.090
He's still here, actually.
Says he's not going back home.

21:03.124 --> 21:04.959
What do you mean?

21:04.993 --> 21:08.161
He wants to move to Edmonton,
quit the relay.

21:08.196 --> 21:11.765
- Well, what'd you say to him?
- What can I say?

21:11.800 --> 21:15.635
I left home and quit the relay
when I was way younger than he is.

21:15.669 --> 21:17.904
He's just following in
his Uncle's footsteps.

21:20.708 --> 21:22.208
Yes, Lou.
I've checked all her clothes

21:22.242 --> 21:23.710
before putting them in the dryer.

21:23.744 --> 21:24.844
Georgie!

21:24.878 --> 21:26.378
don't hang up.

21:26.413 --> 21:28.414
Okay.

21:28.448 --> 21:32.218
Yeah. Yeah. Jack wants to talk to you.

21:32.252 --> 21:35.950
Okay. Okay. Okay, I love you too.

21:36.423 --> 21:39.499
'Kay, bye.

21:39.519 --> 21:41.760
She is on a walk
in Stanley Park with Peter.

21:41.794 --> 21:44.672
She says she'll call you back later.

21:47.400 --> 21:49.602
What? Lou said she'd call you back.

21:49.636 --> 21:51.887
No, no, it's not that.

21:51.907 --> 21:53.705
It's Georgie.

21:53.740 --> 21:56.041
Yesterday,
she seemed a little out of sorts,

21:56.075 --> 21:59.523
but she didn't wanna talk about it,
so I let it go.

21:59.734 --> 22:03.148
I don't know, you think she's
worrying about Lou and Peter?

22:03.182 --> 22:06.351
Well, you can't blame her for
wondering what's going on.

22:06.385 --> 22:08.886
Lou's been away a lot longer than expected.

22:08.920 --> 22:10.721
I hope everything's going all right.

22:10.756 --> 22:13.625
A romantic stroll in the
park sounds promising.

22:13.659 --> 22:16.519
Yeah...
hopefully she's not having too much fun.

22:16.539 --> 22:17.306
Why's that?

22:17.326 --> 22:19.531
Well,
if Lou loves Vancouver as much as Peter,

22:19.565 --> 22:22.240
then she might move the whole family there.

22:26.437 --> 22:28.505
Hey, kid.

22:29.089 --> 22:30.541
What's with you?

22:31.074 --> 22:32.743
University?

22:32.778 --> 22:34.444
I was just trying to look smart,
okay?

22:34.479 --> 22:36.647
Okay, well then wear
a pair of glasses or something.

22:36.682 --> 22:38.849
Just stop pretending to be older.

22:38.884 --> 22:41.518
Well, he might think it's weird, you know,
dating someone in high school.

22:41.553 --> 22:43.487
- Dating?
- It's possible.

22:43.521 --> 22:44.754
Okay, well, in this fantasy world,

22:44.789 --> 22:47.191
where my brother is your boyfriend,

22:47.225 --> 22:49.092
when are you gonna tell him the truth?
At the prom?

22:49.126 --> 22:50.927
Just chill out, okay? It's no big deal.

22:50.961 --> 22:52.339
He's gonna find out.

22:55.966 --> 22:59.302
- What was that all about?
- Nothing.

22:59.336 --> 23:01.204
So I've been looking through the want ads.

23:01.238 --> 23:02.638
A lot of great jobs out there

23:02.673 --> 23:05.041
for a guy with a high school education.

23:05.076 --> 23:09.388
Short order cook, house painter, barista,

23:09.747 --> 23:12.215
Oh, and newspaper delivery man.

23:24.861 --> 23:27.630
Hello there. Can I help you?

23:27.664 --> 23:30.032
Rodney Cantrell.
I'm here to see Tim Fleming.

23:30.066 --> 23:31.666
Oh. Well, I think you got the wrong place.

23:31.701 --> 23:33.802
He's over at Big River.

23:33.837 --> 23:35.370
Oh, I know,
but he told me to meet him here...

23:35.404 --> 23:36.972
For my son's roping lesson.

23:37.006 --> 23:39.407
Oh, he did, did he?

23:39.442 --> 23:41.610
Okay, just uh...

23:41.644 --> 23:44.532
Let me sort something out real quick.

23:44.552 --> 23:46.014
Hang on.

23:46.049 --> 23:48.250
Come on, dad, he's not here.

23:48.284 --> 23:50.985
Why don't you just be patient?
We'll sort it out.

23:51.019 --> 23:52.987
Okay, I don't know where you are,

23:53.021 --> 23:55.823
but it looks like one of
your big wig sponsor is here

23:55.858 --> 23:59.527
and I'm not gonna bail
your butt outta this.

24:02.431 --> 24:03.998
- Here's the thing...
- Now you're not gonna tell us

24:04.032 --> 24:05.933
we drove all the way out here for nothing.

24:05.968 --> 24:09.303
- Well, actually...
- Oh, geez.

24:09.337 --> 24:11.906
You know I almost invested in this school?

24:11.940 --> 24:14.826
What is it?
Some kind of a sham or something?

24:15.235 --> 24:17.879
Uh, no, of course not. I uh...

24:17.913 --> 24:21.682
It's my mistake. I thought that
you were coming tomorrow is all.

24:21.716 --> 24:24.851
Yeah, so... I'm Jack.

24:24.886 --> 24:27.521
I'll be teaching the roping lesson.

24:28.146 --> 24:30.330
Uh, Derek?

24:31.621 --> 24:33.569
- Hi.
- Jack.

24:38.372 --> 24:39.966
I got your text.

24:40.001 --> 24:42.169
Look, I know this is your
decision to make, but...

24:42.203 --> 24:43.636
- Amy...
- I really think you should reconsider.

24:43.671 --> 24:45.424
I think we should go see your mom.

24:45.444 --> 24:47.407
- I do too.
- Oh?

24:48.447 --> 24:50.143
It's my mom...

24:50.482 --> 24:52.405
She doesn't wanna see me.

24:52.425 --> 24:54.514
- What?
- It's like Wade said.

24:54.548 --> 24:56.516
She wants to keep things "low key."

24:56.550 --> 24:57.983
It's her choice, right?

24:58.018 --> 25:00.152
She must just be afraid.

25:00.187 --> 25:02.221
You know, she doesn't want you
to see her like that either.

25:02.255 --> 25:04.190
Well, it is what it is.

25:04.224 --> 25:07.293
Everybody's got their family issues.

25:07.328 --> 25:10.129
And after all the work you did yesterday,

25:10.163 --> 25:12.764
Emmett's quitting the relay,
if you can believe it.

25:12.799 --> 25:16.335
Really? Well,
he's gotta just be afraid of another wreck.

25:16.369 --> 25:19.038
Well, I can't say that I blame him.

25:19.072 --> 25:21.540
What if you never got back on your
motorcycle after the accident?

25:21.574 --> 25:24.243
I mean, you can't just live life in fear.

25:24.277 --> 25:27.525
Well, seems like that's exactly
what Emmett's doing right now.

25:27.545 --> 25:29.878
Yeah... and your mom.

25:31.384 --> 25:34.619
Yeah,
see you're not rolling your wrist enough.

25:34.654 --> 25:37.222
- Yes I am.
- Well, no you're not.

25:37.256 --> 25:39.458
That's why you're having
trouble keeping your loop open.

25:39.492 --> 25:41.025
Can I just throw it already?

25:41.060 --> 25:43.101
Not until you get your swing down.

25:49.668 --> 25:52.937
Okay, here.
I'll show you one more time.

25:52.972 --> 25:55.840
Now watch my wrist. And when I roll it,

25:55.875 --> 25:59.677
i can see the back of my hand, you know?

25:59.711 --> 26:02.722
Now point your finger down
the spoke like I showed you

26:02.742 --> 26:04.348
and roll your wrist.

26:07.619 --> 26:09.754
Ugh! How am I supposed to point my finger

26:09.788 --> 26:11.989
and twist my wrist at the same time?

26:12.023 --> 26:15.292
- It'll come.
- No it won't. This is impossible!

26:15.326 --> 26:17.827
Okay, look,
I can see that you're frustrated,

26:17.862 --> 26:20.530
but you're gonna have to
put in a little effort here.

26:20.564 --> 26:22.939
Otherwise, you're wasting both our time.

26:22.959 --> 26:24.763
Wasting your time?

26:24.783 --> 26:26.036
My dad paid good money for this.

26:26.070 --> 26:27.905
Listen. I'll work for free

26:27.939 --> 26:29.840
if you show me just a little bit of grit.

26:29.860 --> 26:31.875
Now cowboy up, son.

26:31.910 --> 26:34.935
Or would you rather give up,
go back to the city?

26:36.814 --> 26:39.080
- I'll call you back.
- This is a waste of time.

26:40.926 --> 26:42.752
What the hell did you say to my kid?

26:42.787 --> 26:45.733
Oh, he'll tell you all about it,
I have no doubt.

26:45.753 --> 26:47.639
Let's go!

26:49.259 --> 26:51.928
That spoiled brat had it coming.

26:51.962 --> 26:54.797
Well, maybe he did,
or maybe I'm just kidding myself.

26:54.831 --> 26:56.832
That he could actually swing a rope?

26:56.866 --> 27:00.336
No, that I could actually
teach him to swing a rope.

27:02.689 --> 27:04.006
Uncle Scott?

27:04.725 --> 27:06.355
Hey, Emmett.

27:06.375 --> 27:08.644
He's actually out on a
field call right now.

27:09.279 --> 27:11.195
Supposed to meet him for lunch.

27:11.215 --> 27:12.614
Oh.

27:13.213 --> 27:15.277
Well...

27:15.297 --> 27:17.320
He should be back any minute.

27:18.955 --> 27:22.390
Do you, uh, want a coffee or... something?

27:22.722 --> 27:24.645
No, I'm good.

27:25.799 --> 27:29.502
So uh... Scott tells me you're
not racing in the finals.

27:29.522 --> 27:31.766
Nope.

27:31.800 --> 27:33.910
Well, that's too bad.

27:33.930 --> 27:35.703
I mean, it's a dangerous sport,
I mean I get why you're scared.

27:35.737 --> 27:37.385
I'm not afraid of getting hurt.

27:37.405 --> 27:41.008
- Hey, honestly, I don't blame you
- Look, I got a lot to live up to, okay?

27:41.042 --> 27:44.137
What do you mean? With Scott?

27:44.157 --> 27:46.383
It's tough living
in the shadow of a champion.

27:46.403 --> 27:49.249
Champion? Really?

27:49.284 --> 27:51.352
Scott never told me that part.

27:51.386 --> 27:54.188
Yeah,
he was a hero on our reservation.

27:54.222 --> 27:57.798
We'd all go see him race. Hmm.

27:58.392 --> 28:01.595
Then, one day, he just... left us.

28:01.629 --> 28:03.827
I was mad at him for years.

28:03.847 --> 28:05.699
Now I get it.

28:05.733 --> 28:07.734
There's more to life than relay.

28:07.768 --> 28:09.411
Who needs the pressure?

28:09.431 --> 28:11.771
Huh.

28:11.806 --> 28:13.939
So you're not afraid of getting hurt...

28:14.443 --> 28:16.292
You're afraid of losing?

28:17.719 --> 28:20.380
Just tell Scott I'll be at the restaurant.

28:23.191 --> 28:25.583
I just got off the
phone with Rodney Cantrell.

28:25.603 --> 28:28.154
You know who I'm talking about. The guy
that was gonna throw money at my school.

28:28.188 --> 28:29.955
What the hell were you thinking?!

28:29.990 --> 28:32.758
He was trying to save your butt.

28:32.792 --> 28:34.593
Thanks a lot.
You just blew my sponsorship deal.

28:34.628 --> 28:36.294
- C'mon, Tim.
- Hey!

28:36.329 --> 28:38.130
You are the one who dropped the ball here.

28:38.164 --> 28:39.598
You got too much on your plate

28:39.633 --> 28:42.433
and you're just too damn proud to admit it!

28:42.453 --> 28:44.703
See? Now you know why I didn't ask you

28:44.738 --> 28:47.406
to get involved in the first place.

28:59.885 --> 29:03.788
Okay, that was totally unfair.

29:03.822 --> 29:05.599
I'm not in the mood, Georgie.

29:09.732 --> 29:11.780
She's right, you know.

29:12.431 --> 29:15.552
I mean, you're the one who
can't manage your schedule.

29:16.540 --> 29:18.969
You know, I can talk my
way out of a missed appointment,

29:19.003 --> 29:20.938
I can't salvage that.

29:20.972 --> 29:22.873
You didn't even ask
Jack's side of the story.

29:22.907 --> 29:25.207
Because I know how it goes.
He sticks his nose in my business

29:25.227 --> 29:27.411
and it ends up bad.

29:27.446 --> 29:29.080
Do you think you might be
overreacting a little bit?

29:29.114 --> 29:31.848
Casey...
you have no idea what it's been like

29:31.883 --> 29:35.118
dealing with him all these years. Trust me.

29:35.152 --> 29:38.455
I am gonna end up looking
like the bad guy here.

29:38.489 --> 29:41.424
Are you mad at me too now?

29:41.459 --> 29:44.728
I just thought you might have my back.

30:00.111 --> 30:02.312
You say you're fine,
but I know you're not.

30:02.346 --> 30:05.148
Can't you just tell me what happened?

30:05.182 --> 30:07.117
I thought it was going so well up there?

30:07.151 --> 30:12.321
It was...
until my boss moved to another company,

30:12.355 --> 30:15.807
and the new guy...
had it in for me from the start.

30:16.242 --> 30:17.526
Why?

30:17.560 --> 30:19.895
He didn't think that I
had enough experience

30:19.930 --> 30:22.231
to run my own crew...

30:22.265 --> 30:25.267
And he was gonna demote me.

30:25.301 --> 30:27.636
Wait. So you weren't actually fired?

30:27.670 --> 30:29.571
It's the same thing.
How could I face the guys that I work with?

30:29.606 --> 30:33.008
They'd think that I wasn't up to the job...

30:33.042 --> 30:36.811
And... maybe they'd be right.

30:40.864 --> 30:42.536
So what're you gonna do?

30:44.453 --> 30:48.489
I was on this path and...
I knew where I was going,

30:48.524 --> 30:52.741
but he just completely
knocked me off of it.

30:54.118 --> 30:56.551
And now I just feel like uh...

31:00.770 --> 31:03.872
I don't know, it's... it's hard to explain.

31:08.777 --> 31:11.082
So how're you getting there?

31:11.665 --> 31:13.847
The bus I guess.

31:14.338 --> 31:15.608
Where are you gonna stay?

31:15.628 --> 31:17.217
I got a friend who lives downtown,

31:17.251 --> 31:19.612
says I can crash on his couch for a while.

31:22.756 --> 31:25.476
You got something to say just say it.

31:28.752 --> 31:31.859
Leaving the relay was the biggest
mistake of my life, Emmett.

31:33.567 --> 31:36.169
Things seem to have turned
out pretty good for you.

31:36.203 --> 31:39.838
It could've went the other way, trust me.

31:40.306 --> 31:42.374
The relay kept me focused.

31:42.409 --> 31:43.775
There was always a horse to take care of

31:43.810 --> 31:45.578
or a race to go to.

31:45.612 --> 31:48.880
And when I left,
i didn't have that anymore.

31:49.156 --> 31:51.817
I didn't know what to do with myself

31:51.851 --> 31:55.954
and it led me down a very
dark path that could've...

31:55.988 --> 31:57.689
landed me in jail, or worse.

31:57.724 --> 32:00.125
You can't be serious.

32:00.159 --> 32:01.693
You're actually trying
to talk me out of doing

32:01.728 --> 32:03.775
the exact same thing you did?

32:03.795 --> 32:05.530
You're right; Talk is cheap.

32:08.115 --> 32:10.299
How about this.

32:11.036 --> 32:13.542
I'm gonna challenge you to a race.

32:16.572 --> 32:17.642
What?

32:17.676 --> 32:19.468
Are you crazy or something?

32:19.488 --> 32:20.745
Maybe.

32:21.437 --> 32:23.899
But here's the deal.

32:23.919 --> 32:26.999
If I win, you go to the finals,

32:27.019 --> 32:28.753
and then you go home,

32:28.787 --> 32:31.789
or at least until you find
something worth leaving for.

32:32.318 --> 32:34.091
And... when I kick your butt?

32:34.126 --> 32:37.294
I'll give you a ride to Edmonton myself,

32:37.328 --> 32:39.596
and I won't bring up the relay ever again.

32:40.137 --> 32:43.115
All right, Uncle.

32:45.064 --> 32:46.764
Let's race.

32:52.876 --> 32:57.169
Rodeo and sports. That's the approbate
viewing here at Maggie's. Okay?

32:57.517 --> 32:59.868
- All right.
- Good. Simple.

33:00.495 --> 33:02.368
Rodeo and sports.

33:02.388 --> 33:05.545
You can't talk to people that way.

33:05.930 --> 33:06.853
Excuse me?

33:06.873 --> 33:08.777
I meant the way you were talking to Jack.

33:08.811 --> 33:10.655
Oh, here we go again. Okay.

33:10.675 --> 33:13.748
Look, I was there.
All he did was challenge the kid.

33:13.783 --> 33:16.041
You know Jack, he tells it like it is.

33:16.061 --> 33:17.629
don't you think you could
use someone like that?

33:17.649 --> 33:20.321
Georgie, I appreciate you telling me

33:20.355 --> 33:22.958
how to run my business,
but I don't have time.

33:22.992 --> 33:24.759
So why don't you go have a seat

33:24.794 --> 33:26.094
and I'll bring a couple of shakes over

33:26.128 --> 33:27.628
for you and gloomy Gus over there.

33:27.662 --> 33:29.630
That's not funny.

33:29.664 --> 33:31.699
So what was his problem
at dinner the other night?

33:31.733 --> 33:33.033
He doesn't want me to say anything.

33:33.068 --> 33:36.002
Oh, come on, you can tell me.

33:36.022 --> 33:37.938
I'm almost your grandpa or something.

33:37.973 --> 33:39.373
Yeah, actually, you are my grandpa.

33:39.408 --> 33:42.470
Fine, whatever.

33:42.929 --> 33:46.565
Come on,
tell your ol' gramps what's wrong with him.

33:51.419 --> 33:54.067
Got canned, huh?

33:54.551 --> 33:58.325
- Uh... not exactly.
- don't look at your sister like that.

33:58.359 --> 34:01.060
It's not her fault.

34:01.095 --> 34:03.630
She's loves you and she's worried.

34:03.664 --> 34:05.365
So you got canned. So what?

34:05.399 --> 34:08.034
You gotta buck up.
You just gotta get back in the saddle.

34:08.068 --> 34:09.869
I guess that's the cowboy's
answer for everything, right?

34:09.902 --> 34:13.273
I just...
get back on the horse and then I'm fine...

34:13.306 --> 34:16.281
Yeah, it is,
only you gotta do it with swagger.

34:17.777 --> 34:20.078
Can you run that crew?

34:20.463 --> 34:22.148
Well, I mean I can...

34:22.181 --> 34:23.650
And never mind what nimrod boss thinks.

34:23.684 --> 34:26.052
Can you run that crew?

34:28.049 --> 34:30.056
Yeah. I was doing a pretty good job.

34:30.090 --> 34:32.358
Good. So you go back to him

34:32.391 --> 34:33.992
and tell him you want a
chance to prove yourself.

34:34.027 --> 34:36.027
Can you do that?

34:36.062 --> 34:37.751
Yeah!

34:38.097 --> 34:40.032
With swagger!

34:41.138 --> 34:43.735
With swagger...

34:43.770 --> 34:45.704
What're you smiling at?

34:45.737 --> 34:47.806
Nothing.

34:47.840 --> 34:50.938
Sometimes you just...
sound a lot like Jack.

34:53.245 --> 34:55.313
It's been a long time.

34:55.347 --> 34:57.248
You must be getting pretty scared there,
hey, Uncle?

34:57.283 --> 34:58.183
Oh, the start of a relay is like...

34:58.217 --> 35:00.552
heading into the eye of a storm.

35:00.586 --> 35:04.289
Best thing to do is
hold on and ride it out.

35:04.323 --> 35:05.923
So you're old and wise now, huh?

35:08.838 --> 35:10.774
Is that what I think it is?

35:10.794 --> 35:14.031
What, this old thing?
Championship buckle?

35:14.066 --> 35:16.501
You should've left it in the '90s.

35:19.238 --> 35:21.206
Jack?

35:21.240 --> 35:23.307
I'm in no mood for your BS.

35:23.341 --> 35:26.243
Wait a second, before you lay into me.

35:29.249 --> 35:31.781
I wanted to say I'm sorry for what I said.

35:31.801 --> 35:33.350
Hey, save it, Tim. It's your school.

35:33.384 --> 35:36.420
- You do what you want.
- That's right, it is.

35:36.454 --> 35:37.855
I want your help.

35:37.889 --> 35:39.356
And why would I do that?

35:39.390 --> 35:41.024
Do you...

35:41.058 --> 35:43.760
why do you have to make
everything so difficult?

35:43.794 --> 35:47.063
I want you to help me because
I can't do it all by myself.

35:47.098 --> 35:48.798
I wanted to, believe me,

35:48.833 --> 35:50.334
if for no other reason than to just say

35:50.368 --> 35:52.269
that I finally saw something through.

35:52.303 --> 35:53.670
But I can't do it. It's too much, Jack,

35:53.705 --> 35:56.172
I need your help.

35:56.207 --> 35:58.074
And you're the guy.
The way you dealt with that kid,

35:58.109 --> 35:59.743
that's exactly how i would've done it.

35:59.777 --> 36:01.845
Then why did you come unglued on me?

36:01.879 --> 36:04.714
I don't know.

36:04.749 --> 36:07.775
I did the same thing to Casey when we left.

36:11.222 --> 36:12.921
When... I was fly fishing with Casey,

36:12.956 --> 36:15.358
I got a text... from Shane.

36:15.392 --> 36:18.093
Everything okay?

36:18.128 --> 36:21.196
Miranda's getting married...

36:21.231 --> 36:23.455
This weekend.

36:24.200 --> 36:26.272
Okay, on my cue.

36:26.292 --> 36:28.384
- Do it, buddy! Come on!
- You can do this! Woo!

36:28.404 --> 36:30.705
Go!

36:30.740 --> 36:33.041
Ungh!

36:36.780 --> 36:37.813
- Come on, Scott!
- That's right, Scott! You can do it!

36:37.847 --> 36:39.381
Let's go! Come on!

36:39.415 --> 36:41.917
Okay,
make sure Barega stays looking forward.

36:46.922 --> 36:49.157
Come on!

36:53.396 --> 36:55.397
Come on! Woo!

37:01.804 --> 37:03.971
'Kay, Scott, go, go, go, go, go!

37:04.006 --> 37:06.607
- I got it! I got it!
- Come on, Emmett!

37:06.641 --> 37:08.910
Ready? Go! Go!

37:08.944 --> 37:11.712
Get outta my way, Ty! Go!

37:11.746 --> 37:13.681
Hyah!

37:16.919 --> 37:19.753
Wow! That was crazy.

37:19.788 --> 37:21.388
Okay, Scott, go!

37:24.158 --> 37:27.060
- Open it up! Open it up!
- Run, Scott, run!

37:34.468 --> 37:37.537
- Yeah, come on! Come on!
- Go, Scott!

37:49.884 --> 37:51.584
- Wow!
- That was intense!

37:51.618 --> 37:53.052
Yeah, what a race.

37:56.990 --> 38:01.570
- It's just... too bad.
- Yeah.

38:04.808 --> 38:06.607
Thanks so much for us in.

38:06.714 --> 38:08.347
My heart is still racing.

38:08.382 --> 38:09.834
You guys did great.

38:09.854 --> 38:11.919
I can't actually believe
that was you out there.

38:11.939 --> 38:14.220
- You were really good.
- Not good enough.

38:14.254 --> 38:16.756
Time to pay up, Uncle.

38:17.327 --> 38:19.893
Yeah.

38:19.927 --> 38:21.394
I guess you won fair and square.

38:23.130 --> 38:25.931
Nah, put those away. Not going anywhere.

38:28.125 --> 38:30.310
I want the buckle.

38:32.580 --> 38:35.000
To wear to the finals.

38:36.009 --> 38:37.842
You're gonna race!

38:37.862 --> 38:41.756
For years, I worried I couldn't live up
to what you did in relay.

38:42.248 --> 38:45.083
I guess I was wrong, 'cause...

38:45.117 --> 38:46.518
I kicked your butt really good.

38:50.256 --> 38:52.074
Thanks, Amy.

38:57.996 --> 38:59.841
I'm not a horrible person.

38:59.861 --> 39:02.333
What? No.

39:02.368 --> 39:04.102
Look,
you never should've lied to my brother,

39:04.136 --> 39:06.554
but I never said you
were a horrible person.

39:06.574 --> 39:07.838
Maybe a little boy crazy...

39:07.873 --> 39:12.168
hey! Well... maybe a little.

39:12.999 --> 39:15.379
You know he's
upstairs in the loft packing,

39:15.413 --> 39:18.215
if you wanna go say goodbye.

39:18.249 --> 39:21.719
No. I feel too stupid about everything.

39:21.753 --> 39:24.221
Wait... So you're telling me

39:24.255 --> 39:25.790
you came all the way over here

39:25.824 --> 39:27.091
just to make sure I didn't think

39:27.125 --> 39:28.791
you were a horrible person?

39:28.811 --> 39:30.360
Mm-hmm.

39:30.395 --> 39:33.330
Oh my God, you know what this means?

39:33.364 --> 39:34.631
You actually care what I think...

39:34.665 --> 39:36.567
Okay, shut up.

39:38.669 --> 39:40.209
- Hey.
- Hey!

39:40.229 --> 39:41.371
- Hey.
- Here, I'll take this to the truck.

39:41.406 --> 39:44.192
Oh. All right. O-kay.

39:45.776 --> 39:48.275
I have to tell you something.

39:48.871 --> 39:52.248
I'm in high school. I'm only seventeen.

39:52.282 --> 39:54.284
Oh yeah?

39:55.872 --> 39:57.522
Well, um...

39:58.122 --> 40:01.057
I haven't exactly been... myself

40:01.092 --> 40:04.594
the last couple of days either.

40:04.628 --> 40:08.043
So... next time I'm back,

40:08.986 --> 40:12.935
would you consider going out with me again?

40:13.356 --> 40:16.285
The... real me?

40:17.274 --> 40:19.499
I'll think about it.

40:23.312 --> 40:25.014
Ahem!

40:25.048 --> 40:27.519
Guys, still here.

40:31.254 --> 40:33.022
Hello.

40:33.056 --> 40:35.008
Well, Lou, sweetheart.

40:35.028 --> 40:38.293
Hey, I thought you were
gonna call me back yesterday.

40:38.327 --> 40:41.263
Oh? Well that is fantastic news.

40:41.297 --> 40:43.198
I'll pick you up at the airport myself.

40:43.232 --> 40:44.932
Jack?!

40:44.967 --> 40:47.636
Oh... oh? Oh, okay.

40:47.670 --> 40:50.905
Well,
then we'll see you here tomorrow then.

40:50.939 --> 40:54.108
Okay. Yeah, bye.

40:54.143 --> 40:55.771
Lou's coming home.

40:55.791 --> 40:58.046
Good. Great.

40:58.080 --> 41:00.682
Boy, this Miranda thing's
really got you twisted up.

41:00.716 --> 41:03.617
I can't-I can't stop reading this text.

41:03.652 --> 41:06.353
Like... look- look at this.

41:06.388 --> 41:09.190
"You'll never believe this.

41:09.224 --> 41:11.760
Mom's getting married, dot, dot, dot,

41:11.780 --> 41:14.027
this Saturday - in capitals -

41:14.062 --> 41:16.829
exclamation mark."

41:17.896 --> 41:21.780
I interpret that,
that he thinks she's rushing into it.

41:21.800 --> 41:25.772
Well...
maybe it means that he's excited;

41:25.807 --> 41:27.273
that he thinks it's a good thing.

41:27.308 --> 41:29.199
Well, you know,
I don't know how people think

41:29.219 --> 41:32.079
this is even communicating.

41:32.113 --> 41:35.399
Just call him, exclamation mark!

41:37.218 --> 41:40.353
Yeah, I should... I will.

41:41.524 --> 41:45.408
I...
I'll call him, get it all straightened out.

41:55.902 --> 41:58.271
Are you coming in?

41:58.305 --> 42:01.534
No.
I just wanted to give you a proper goodbye.

42:07.047 --> 42:11.617
Wow. That wasn't a "see ya tomorrow"
kind of kiss.

42:11.878 --> 42:14.323
I'm going to visit my mom.

42:14.821 --> 42:18.337
- What made you change your mind?
- I don't know.

42:18.357 --> 42:21.439
Maybe it was this whole
Scott and Emmett thing...

42:21.459 --> 42:24.703
Seeing the kind of impact
you can have on your family.

42:26.232 --> 42:28.333
I wanna help her stay clean this time.

42:28.368 --> 42:30.402
I still wanna come with you.

42:30.436 --> 42:32.779
I want you to come too.

42:32.799 --> 42:35.645
But I gotta think about
what's best for mom.

42:35.968 --> 42:38.609
She's got a lot of pride,
you know what I mean?

42:39.106 --> 42:40.979
I get it.

42:41.725 --> 42:43.148
You go.

42:43.487 --> 42:45.584
I'm gonna miss you though.

42:50.284 --> 42:53.635
You know,
your mom is really lucky to have you.

42:54.528 --> 42:56.794
So am I.

42:57.519 --> 42:58.562
I love you.

42:58.597 --> 43:00.464
I love you too.
