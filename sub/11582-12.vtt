(male announcer)
In the criminal justice system,

00:08.242 --> 00:12.113
sexually based offenses are
considered especially heinous.

00:12.146 --> 00:14.615
In New York City,
the dedicated detectives

00:14.648 --> 00:16.650
who investigate
these vicious felonies

00:16.684 --> 00:18.152
are members of an elite squad

00:18.186 --> 00:20.121
known as
the Special Victims Unit.

00:20.154 --> 00:21.155
These are their stories.

00:23.457 --> 00:27.261
(car GPS)
You have arrived
at your destination.

00:27.295 --> 00:29.263
(man)
This doesn't look like a hot
after-hours club to me, Herb.

00:29.297 --> 00:31.532
It's covered with graffiti.

00:31.565 --> 00:33.501
Lemme see the address.
Maybe you punched it in wrong.

00:33.534 --> 00:34.502
No, this--

00:34.535 --> 00:37.271
This dump is the right place.

00:37.305 --> 00:38.472
It doesn't make sense.

00:38.506 --> 00:40.574
Those models
were totally into us.

00:40.608 --> 00:42.143
It's 2:30.

00:42.176 --> 00:44.178
I think we should just
call it a night.

00:44.212 --> 00:45.846
And you wonder why you don't
get laid, Melvin.

00:45.879 --> 00:48.282
[in a baby voice]
I'm a scared little girl.

00:48.316 --> 00:51.385
Someone might mess up
my frilly dress--

00:51.419 --> 00:53.654
A bus just took off
with the car's occupants.

00:53.687 --> 00:54.622
They see anything?

00:54.655 --> 00:56.257
Just the windshield
up close and personal

00:56.290 --> 00:57.325
when the body hit.

00:57.358 --> 00:59.227
Building's got no windows.

00:59.260 --> 01:01.295
Must've taken a nose-dive
from the roof.

01:01.329 --> 01:02.763
With his pants
around his ankles.

01:02.796 --> 01:04.198
Maybe he solicited

01:04.232 --> 01:06.234
the wrong hooker
and she rolled him.

01:06.267 --> 01:09.137
Don't think
she'd have left this.

01:09.170 --> 01:10.371
$2,000.

01:10.404 --> 01:11.805
All in fifties.

01:11.839 --> 01:14.575
Not quite fat enough
to cushion the fall.

01:14.608 --> 01:16.410
Judging by the blood spatter
on the hood,

01:16.444 --> 01:19.447
his heart was still pumping
when he hit the windshield.

01:19.480 --> 01:22.283
Luis Vega.
Just turned 25.

01:22.316 --> 01:25.319
Looks like he died
two blocks from his house.

01:25.353 --> 01:27.155
Then he was slummin' it.

01:27.188 --> 01:29.457
Check this out, he's got
a Rolex, diamond studs.

01:29.490 --> 01:32.660
(Stabler)
"S.C.A."

01:32.693 --> 01:34.228
That's not his initials.

01:34.262 --> 01:35.263
Could be his girlfriend's.

01:35.296 --> 01:38.666
So...they like having sex
in dangerous places,

01:38.699 --> 01:41.135
they had a mishap.

01:41.169 --> 01:42.870
Then this girlfriend's got
some serious issues

01:42.903 --> 01:44.272
with the relationship.

01:44.305 --> 01:45.239
Why do you say that?

01:45.273 --> 01:47.675
She left deep bite marks

01:47.708 --> 01:49.877
on his penis.

02:40.661 --> 02:42.563
About the bug that got scraped
off the windshield--

02:42.596 --> 02:44.398
A little respect
for the dead, please.

02:44.432 --> 02:46.467
We ran your dearly departed
through the system.

02:46.500 --> 02:47.468
Luis Vega.

02:47.501 --> 02:49.703
Possession, assault,
petty theft, and burglary.

02:49.737 --> 02:51.405
No sex assaults?

02:51.439 --> 02:53.241
He did a bullet upstate
for knocking over an OTB.

02:53.274 --> 02:54.542
Got out six months ago.

02:54.575 --> 02:55.676
And went right back
to his old ways,

02:55.709 --> 02:57.511
judging by the two grand
in his pocket.

02:57.545 --> 02:58.679
Not to mention the bling.

02:58.712 --> 03:01.615
Any leads on a girlfriend
with the initials "S.C.A."?

03:01.649 --> 03:04.718
That's no lady, that's a gang.
Stone Cold Assassins.

03:04.752 --> 03:05.953
(Stabler)
This wasn't the M.O.

03:05.986 --> 03:06.954
of a gang hit.

03:06.987 --> 03:08.589
(Cragen)
Well, maybe the guy wanted out,

03:08.622 --> 03:10.291
and one of the gang girls
set him up.

03:10.324 --> 03:11.759
It's not like there's
any retirement plan.

03:11.792 --> 03:13.561
It's blood in, blood out.

03:13.594 --> 03:15.263
(Munch)
He is a rapist.

03:15.296 --> 03:16.564
I knew Luis Vega
sounded familiar.

03:16.597 --> 03:18.999
I took a DD-5 on a rape
a couple of months ago.

03:19.032 --> 03:20.568
Complaining witness
was an 18-year-old

03:20.601 --> 03:22.303
named Claudia Hernandez.

03:22.336 --> 03:23.671
Don't tell me Novak
pled out the gangbanger.

03:23.704 --> 03:26.974
No, Claudia recanted
before I could track him down.

03:27.007 --> 03:30.311
But maybe she decided to
take justice into her own hands.

03:30.344 --> 03:31.679
Let's see if we can't
put Claudia

03:31.712 --> 03:33.847
on that roof with Luis.

03:36.317 --> 03:37.885
(Munch)
How you doing, Claudia?

03:37.918 --> 03:39.653
Long time no see.

03:39.687 --> 03:40.854
What do you want?

03:40.888 --> 03:43.391
A few words
about Luis Vega.

03:43.424 --> 03:44.692
I dropped those charges.

03:44.725 --> 03:45.526
Yeah, well someone

03:45.559 --> 03:47.661
dropped him
off a roof last night.

03:47.695 --> 03:49.263
Look, I had nothing
to do with him

03:49.297 --> 03:50.431
or that gang no more.

03:50.464 --> 03:52.633
You didn't say you were a member
of the Stone Cold Assassin

03:52.666 --> 03:53.634
when we first met.

03:53.667 --> 03:55.569
Maria.

03:55.603 --> 03:57.671
Can you take over for me,
please?

03:57.705 --> 04:01.008
Look, I never made it
into the gang.

04:01.041 --> 04:02.443
Yeah, but you tried.

04:02.476 --> 04:04.445
Once you're in,
you live the sweet life.

04:04.478 --> 04:06.547
But I couldn't pass
initiation.

04:06.580 --> 04:07.781
Which was what?

04:07.815 --> 04:10.284
Ladies choice.
I tossed the dice.

04:10.318 --> 04:14.588
See how many gang members
she'd have to have sex with.

04:14.622 --> 04:16.690
I rolled an 11.

04:16.724 --> 04:19.026
I made it through three.

04:19.059 --> 04:20.628
But I couldn't take it no more.

04:20.661 --> 04:22.763
Was Luis one of the three?

04:22.796 --> 04:24.932
No.
He was number four.

04:24.965 --> 04:25.933
You changed your mind,

04:25.966 --> 04:27.501
but he took his turn anyway.

04:27.535 --> 04:29.036
I was almost home.

04:29.069 --> 04:31.472
Got me in the stairwell.

04:31.505 --> 04:32.973
But why'd you drop the charge?

04:33.006 --> 04:33.974
'Cause I wanted to live.

04:34.007 --> 04:34.975
The thing is,

04:35.008 --> 04:37.378
you're alive and Luis isn't.

04:37.411 --> 04:39.747
You think I'm the only girl
he ever raped?

04:39.780 --> 04:43.751
A lotta rubies
had trouble with him.

04:43.784 --> 04:45.619
Looks like two
of Luis' rubies,

04:45.653 --> 04:47.087
glued to the pinball,
as promised.

04:47.120 --> 04:48.922
Damn it.

04:48.956 --> 04:50.691
Popo in the house.

04:50.724 --> 04:52.860
Ladies, sorry
for your loss.

04:52.893 --> 04:54.595
I didn't lose.
I'm high score.

04:54.628 --> 04:57.064
I'm talking about
your gang brother Luis.

04:57.097 --> 04:58.966
We ain't no bangers.

04:58.999 --> 05:00.401
Sweetie, you have "S.C.A."

05:00.434 --> 05:02.736
stenciled across your nails.

05:02.770 --> 05:04.638
Gotta belong somewhere, yo.

05:04.672 --> 05:06.039
Where, with a bunch of guys
who abuse you?

05:06.073 --> 05:07.708
Assassins take care of us.
How?

05:07.741 --> 05:09.610
By using you as drug mules,

05:09.643 --> 05:11.612
pimping you out, beating you up?

05:11.645 --> 05:13.414
It's better than the crap
I get at home.

05:13.447 --> 05:14.582
How old are you?

05:14.615 --> 05:15.683
16.

05:15.716 --> 05:17.050
Yo, Carmen,
our slices are up.

05:17.084 --> 05:19.687
Well, Luis was 25.
He ever mess with you?

05:19.720 --> 05:21.755
Luis wasn't even hardly
in the mix no more.

05:21.789 --> 05:24.558
He only came around
for the fringe benefits.

05:24.592 --> 05:26.460
Meaning he raped you too.

05:26.494 --> 05:28.429
(Stabler)
The girl who killed him

05:28.462 --> 05:29.997
was just trying to defend
herself.

05:30.030 --> 05:31.064
Okay? Defend herself.

05:31.098 --> 05:33.534
Now, we don't want your boys
retaliating against her.

05:33.567 --> 05:35.936
Talk to us. Protect yourself.

05:35.969 --> 05:38.572
Or at least
one of your sisters.

05:38.606 --> 05:40.574
(Carmen)
Wasn't no sister
that killed him.

05:40.608 --> 05:43.043
Just some crazy-ass
homeless girl, deaf mute.

05:43.076 --> 05:44.578
But not ugly, though.

05:44.612 --> 05:46.447
Everyone knows Luis liked
to mess with her.

05:46.480 --> 05:48.382
(Stabler)
What makes you think
she killed him?

05:48.416 --> 05:50.451
Word on the street, she been
sleeping up on that roof.

05:50.484 --> 05:53.086
Where can we find her now?

05:55.823 --> 05:58.426
(woman)
70,000 displaced souls

05:58.459 --> 06:00.060
just in this city.

06:00.093 --> 06:01.729
I haven't met them all.

06:01.762 --> 06:04.665
Well, she's young, pretty,
and deaf.

06:04.698 --> 06:06.667
Why you looking for her?

06:06.700 --> 06:07.701
(Stabler)
Stone Cold Assassins

06:07.735 --> 06:08.536
think she killed

06:08.569 --> 06:09.570
one of their members,
Sister Peg.

06:09.603 --> 06:11.872
Most likely in self-defense
as he was raping her,

06:11.905 --> 06:14.742
but we doubt S.C.A.'s
gonna split that hair.

06:16.644 --> 06:18.546
Hey, where you going?

06:18.579 --> 06:21.181
You won't find Katie without me.

06:21.214 --> 06:24.518
And I know sign language.

06:25.586 --> 06:26.720
That's her.

06:26.754 --> 06:27.921
She's teamed up with Betty.

06:27.955 --> 06:29.490
(Benson)
She must know
that she's in danger.

06:29.523 --> 06:31.825
She's 50 blocks from where
she usually sleeps.

06:31.859 --> 06:35.796
Mm-mm, Upper East Side garbage
has better pickin's.

06:35.829 --> 06:37.565
Katie.

06:37.598 --> 06:39.700
These people are here
to help you.

06:39.733 --> 06:41.635
She can lip-read.

06:41.669 --> 06:43.170
Relax, we just wanna talk.

06:43.203 --> 06:44.838
We just wanna talk.

06:44.872 --> 06:48.476
You have a history
with this guy Luis?

06:50.811 --> 06:53.213
She said she wasn't
up there last night.

06:53.246 --> 06:54.782
She slept at Grand Central.

06:54.815 --> 06:56.917
Who said anything
about last night?

07:02.155 --> 07:04.658
I got there after.
Saw him dead on the car.

07:04.692 --> 07:05.659
(Benson)
We have a homicide

07:05.693 --> 07:07.995
that we can't close

07:08.028 --> 07:10.698
without your cooperation.

07:10.731 --> 07:11.899
She swears
she didn't do it.

07:11.932 --> 07:14.602
The Stone Cold Assassins
are looking for you.

07:14.635 --> 07:15.636
You're not safe on the street,

07:15.669 --> 07:18.606
so for your protection,
we're gonna bring you in.

07:20.874 --> 07:22.876
No, let her go, let her go.
She won't talk to you.

07:22.910 --> 07:24.512
I gotta talk to her.

07:24.545 --> 07:27.047
She trusts me.
Now, I'll work with her.

07:27.080 --> 07:29.216
Bring her down to the precinct.

07:32.753 --> 07:35.523
Let's go find Betty.

07:35.556 --> 07:36.624
We have to talk to you

07:36.657 --> 07:38.759
about your friend Katie.

07:38.792 --> 07:40.861
How do you two communicate?

07:40.894 --> 07:43.263
She reads my lips,
I read her notes.

07:43.296 --> 07:46.967
Has she written you any notes
recently about Luis Vega?

07:47.000 --> 07:48.268
No.

07:48.301 --> 07:50.170
Well, maybe we could see
some of her notes.

07:50.203 --> 07:51.739
Do you have 'em in here?

07:51.772 --> 07:53.173
You can't have it!

07:53.206 --> 07:55.976
Luis pays us $50
for this stuff.

07:56.009 --> 07:57.277
Why, what do you got in there?

07:57.310 --> 08:01.181
None of your business.
Luis had a roll of fifties
on him.

08:01.214 --> 08:03.884
I got 38 bucks.
I got 24.

08:03.917 --> 08:05.586
Hey, Betty! Betty.

08:05.619 --> 08:09.089
I'll give you $62
for those bags.
Look at that.

08:09.122 --> 08:10.090
62, right there.

08:10.123 --> 08:12.292
Done.
Good.

08:12.325 --> 08:14.261
Lots of papers.

08:14.294 --> 08:16.096
Not just any papers.

08:16.129 --> 08:20.200
Utility bills,
credit card bills--

08:20.233 --> 08:22.736
Oh, hundreds of 'em.

08:22.770 --> 08:26.206
Everything you'd need
to steal someone's identity.

08:26.239 --> 08:28.576
Betty, you and Katie

08:28.609 --> 08:30.243
working for Luis?

08:30.277 --> 08:32.279
Luis pays a lot of street folks
to do this.

08:32.312 --> 08:34.915
Any idea where Luis
takes this stuff?

08:37.084 --> 08:39.219
Federal agents.
Everyone stay where you are.

08:39.252 --> 08:40.921
Hands where we can see them.

08:40.954 --> 08:43.056
This warrant allows us
to search the premises.

08:43.090 --> 08:45.826
Carmen, hey,
thanks for volunteering.

08:45.859 --> 08:47.561
Why don't you give me
a little office tour?

08:47.595 --> 08:48.929
I was just playing
computer games!

08:48.962 --> 08:50.297
It looks like
a spreadsheet to me.

08:50.330 --> 08:52.299
We got names, addresses,
dates of birth,

08:52.332 --> 08:53.433
social security numbers.

08:53.466 --> 08:55.869
And people call me paranoid
for shredding my junk mail.

08:55.903 --> 08:58.105
Blank credit cards,
embossing machines.

08:58.138 --> 08:59.306
Like printing their own money.

08:59.339 --> 09:00.774
Ten million victims last year.

09:00.808 --> 09:03.143
Cost banks and consumers
50 billion.

09:03.176 --> 09:05.613
Six months tops,
probably suspended.

09:05.646 --> 09:07.581
(Stabler)
No, no, no, no, no.
That's why the Feds are here.

09:07.615 --> 09:09.883
Mail fraud,
ongoing criminal conspiracy.

09:09.917 --> 09:11.218
They'll be trying you
under RICO.

09:11.251 --> 09:13.053
Never heard of him.
(Benson)
Sweetheart, it's a law

09:13.086 --> 09:14.822
that'll keep you in jail
'til your old and wrinkled.

09:14.855 --> 09:15.956
Unless you wanna tell me

09:15.989 --> 09:17.290
who can call the dogs
off Katie.

09:17.324 --> 09:18.759
I ain't talkin' to no police!

09:18.792 --> 09:21.328
Let's go meet Rico.
Whoever the hell he is.

09:21.361 --> 09:22.630
This street gang
used the homeless

09:22.663 --> 09:23.997
to rack up over a million bucks?

09:24.031 --> 09:25.899
Doesn't anybody read
their credit card bills?

09:25.933 --> 09:27.868
They never got 'em.

09:27.901 --> 09:29.670
The gang would file
a change of address

09:29.703 --> 09:31.839
to a private mail drop,
and then apply for new cards.

09:31.872 --> 09:33.006
Lot of victims
don't even know it yet.

09:33.040 --> 09:34.007
Yeah, and they're not going to

09:34.041 --> 09:35.108
'til they go buy
their dream house

09:35.142 --> 09:37.645
with their perfect rating,
which is now in the toilet.

09:37.678 --> 09:38.912
Sister Peg?

09:38.946 --> 09:40.814
What's the matter?

09:40.848 --> 09:43.050
I-I promised to protect her.

09:43.083 --> 09:45.218
I told Katie she'd be safe
in my shelter.

09:45.252 --> 09:46.920
You were supposed to
bring her here, where is he?

09:46.954 --> 09:48.756
Everybody was asleep.

09:48.789 --> 09:50.924
I just left the room
for a minute.

09:50.958 --> 09:52.325
And then he ran right into me.

09:52.359 --> 09:56.029
He said he'd come back
if I talked.

09:56.063 --> 09:59.800
What did he do to Katie?

09:59.833 --> 10:01.735
[sobbing]
He slit her throat.

10:09.109 --> 10:10.377
(Benson)
Gangbanger cut her ear to ear.

10:10.410 --> 10:13.013
He was sending a message,
cutting her vocal cords.

10:13.046 --> 10:14.782
It was completely pointless.

10:14.815 --> 10:16.049
Yeah, we know.

10:16.083 --> 10:17.685
I don't think you do.

10:17.718 --> 10:19.920
I had a forensic odontist
make a mold of her mouth

10:19.953 --> 10:23.724
to compare with the bite marks
on Luis.

10:23.757 --> 10:25.058
They don't match.

10:25.092 --> 10:26.359
He killed the wrong girl.

10:26.393 --> 10:27.661
Without a doubt.

10:27.695 --> 10:29.296
I'm still waiting
for DNA results

10:29.329 --> 10:31.198
from saliva off the bite marks.

10:31.231 --> 10:33.200
But I did run
a chromosomal analysis

10:33.233 --> 10:35.335
to narrow down
a few genetic traits.

10:35.368 --> 10:37.137
Well, great,
we'll print up flyers,

10:37.170 --> 10:39.206
hope somebody recognizes
her genes.

10:39.239 --> 10:41.775
We've all got 23 pairs
of chromosomes.

10:41.809 --> 10:45.212
The 46th strand
determines gender.

10:45.245 --> 10:46.780
That's a "Y" chromosome.

10:46.814 --> 10:49.917
Yep.
Luis was up there with a man.

10:55.455 --> 10:57.891
There. Halfway up
the courtyard.

10:57.925 --> 10:59.292
It was dark,
but I think that's him.

10:59.326 --> 11:00.560
It is.

11:00.593 --> 11:03.897
That's the banger
the Stone Cold Assassins sent

11:03.931 --> 11:06.299
to kill Katie.

11:06.333 --> 11:08.268
Come on, you gotta see this.
Five minutes.

11:08.301 --> 11:11.138
I'll leave the door open.
Come on, baby.

11:11.171 --> 11:14.041
Good decision.
Take a hike, he's mine.

11:14.074 --> 11:15.275
I know you?

11:15.308 --> 11:16.376
Why you play me like that

11:16.409 --> 11:17.377
after everything
we've been through?

11:17.410 --> 11:20.413
The hell?

11:20.447 --> 11:22.082
You're under arrest.

11:22.115 --> 11:24.284
[grunts]

11:26.419 --> 11:28.121
Hector Ramirez.

11:28.155 --> 11:29.256
You have the right

11:29.289 --> 11:31.224
to remain silent--
You got the wrong guy!

11:31.258 --> 11:32.960
Anything you say can
and will be used against you

11:32.993 --> 11:34.294
in a court of law--

11:34.327 --> 11:36.897
Oh, what do we have here?
Gravity knife.

11:36.930 --> 11:37.765
What, are you stupid enough

11:37.798 --> 11:39.066
to carry the murder weapon
with you?

11:39.099 --> 11:41.969
Who you calling stupid?
You, Stupid.
You killed the wrong girl.

11:42.002 --> 11:42.770
I didn't killed nobody.

11:42.803 --> 11:44.738
Luis wasn't on that roof
with Katie.

11:44.772 --> 11:46.406
He was doin' a guy.
You're lying.

11:46.439 --> 11:47.407
(Sister)
He has a dragon tattoo

11:47.440 --> 11:49.743
on his left wrist.

11:49.777 --> 11:52.846
(Stabler)
S.C.A.
Stone Cold Assassins.

11:52.880 --> 11:54.014
Go back to the car.

11:54.047 --> 11:55.415
I'm not afraid of this coward.

11:55.448 --> 11:56.917
You should be, bitch!

11:56.950 --> 11:58.251
You think
you're a big man?

11:58.285 --> 11:59.753
Killing a deaf girl
when she's asleep?

11:59.787 --> 12:02.856
She wasn't asleep.
She was scared and begging.

12:02.890 --> 12:04.091
[grunts]
Be careful
of his teeth.

12:04.124 --> 12:06.059
We gotta make a cast
to match the bite marks

12:06.093 --> 12:08.228
on Luis' genitals.
What?

12:08.261 --> 12:09.396
Is that why
you killed Katie, huh?

12:09.429 --> 12:10.898
She see you
with your boyfriend?

12:10.931 --> 12:12.065
I'm no maricon!

12:12.099 --> 12:13.066
You're a filthy liar.

12:13.100 --> 12:14.201
You say Katie was begging?

12:14.234 --> 12:15.435
She couldn't even speak.

12:15.468 --> 12:16.436
She tried!

12:16.469 --> 12:17.905
Kept mouthing.

12:17.938 --> 12:19.439
[mockingly]
Wasn't me.

12:19.472 --> 12:21.308
Making this retarded
hand signal.

12:21.341 --> 12:24.344
Uncuff his hand.
[grunts]

12:24.377 --> 12:26.079
What was it?

12:26.113 --> 12:27.514
What was it!

12:29.883 --> 12:32.085
Doesn't make sense.

12:32.119 --> 12:34.387
That's the sign for graffiti.

12:35.923 --> 12:38.025
(Stabler)
So this is
what Katie called home.

12:38.058 --> 12:39.392
(Fin)
Graffiti central.

12:39.426 --> 12:41.428
(Stabler)
Luis' body hit the car
down there,

12:41.461 --> 12:43.130
and this is the only way up.

12:43.163 --> 12:45.232
Katie didn't get here
after the attack.

12:45.265 --> 12:50.237
She got here during it.

12:50.270 --> 12:51.438
She must've been
trying to tell Hector

12:51.471 --> 12:52.572
she saw somebody else up here.

12:52.605 --> 12:54.808
Someone with a can
of spray paint.

12:54.842 --> 12:56.343
Well, this is old and weathered.

12:56.376 --> 12:57.811
You know, it's been here
for a while.

12:57.845 --> 12:59.312
But that looks new.

12:59.346 --> 13:00.213
Maybe that's our guy.

13:00.247 --> 13:01.381
(Fin)
There's a signature

13:01.414 --> 13:03.450
inside the 2.

13:04.985 --> 13:07.054
S.Y.K.

13:07.087 --> 13:09.089
Rival gang?

13:09.122 --> 13:11.424
Luis comes up here
to rape Katie.

13:11.458 --> 13:13.927
Instead he finds another banger
tagging his turf.

13:13.961 --> 13:16.897
And he teaches him a lesson
by making him his bitch?

13:16.930 --> 13:18.498
S.Y.K. isn't going for it.

13:18.531 --> 13:22.002
So he bites down,
barrels into Luis--

13:22.035 --> 13:23.370
He falls.

13:23.403 --> 13:25.238
Rolls down the slope.

13:25.272 --> 13:27.474
(Stabler)
Three stories down, splat.

13:27.507 --> 13:29.442
Right onto the car.

13:29.476 --> 13:32.379
Totals out a damn fine Beemer.

13:33.480 --> 13:36.249
So who are the B22Bs?

13:36.283 --> 13:38.518
(Delvecchio)
B, 2, and two Bs.

13:38.551 --> 13:40.921
Born To Be Bad.

13:40.954 --> 13:43.623
Originated out of
a hoity-toity private school

13:43.656 --> 13:45.025
on the Upper East Side.

13:45.058 --> 13:46.593
A gang of bored rich kids?

13:46.626 --> 13:49.096
Not a street gang,
a writing crew.

13:49.129 --> 13:50.998
This was just
a graffiti artist?

13:51.031 --> 13:52.499
Anti-Graffiti Task Force removed

13:52.532 --> 13:55.635
16 million square feet
of that art last year.

13:55.668 --> 13:57.905
All at taxpayers' expense.

13:57.938 --> 14:00.974
They deface property.
They're criminals, not artists.

14:01.008 --> 14:01.808
(Fin)
They get street cred

14:01.841 --> 14:04.344
for style, volume,
and degree of risk.

14:04.377 --> 14:06.279
Like a three-story billboard
in Harlem.

14:06.313 --> 14:08.181
Yeah, highway overpasses,
bridges,

14:08.215 --> 14:09.917
inner walls of subways.

14:09.950 --> 14:12.319
We've had more
than a few casualties.

14:12.352 --> 14:13.453
So what's S.Y.K.?

14:13.486 --> 14:14.521
That's the tagger's signature.

14:14.554 --> 14:16.456
He's calling himself "Sick."

14:16.489 --> 14:17.557
(Munch)
You run across him before?

14:17.590 --> 14:18.625
Know S.Y.K.

14:18.658 --> 14:20.293
They've got a S.Y.K.O.

14:20.327 --> 14:22.429
Says he pronounces it "psycho."

14:22.462 --> 14:24.631
Real name's Logan Stanton.

14:27.534 --> 14:29.469
(boy)
What would I be doing
in Harlem?

14:29.502 --> 14:32.072
Graffiti Task Forces says
you get around, Logan.

14:32.105 --> 14:33.673
Subways, water towers.

14:33.706 --> 14:35.175
Headmaster said
you left your mark

14:35.208 --> 14:37.110
on every nook and cranny
of this building.

14:37.144 --> 14:38.645
It was a phase.
I got over it.

14:38.678 --> 14:39.679
Being "Syko"?

14:39.712 --> 14:41.581
Why would you call
yourself that?

14:41.614 --> 14:44.051
My therapist said it was
a desperate cry for attention.

14:44.084 --> 14:45.552
But you worked through it?

14:45.585 --> 14:49.422
Yeah, a hundred hours of
community service did the trick.

14:49.456 --> 14:50.490
Hey, that's my locker.

14:50.523 --> 14:51.591
(Munch)
Looks like someone still has

14:51.624 --> 14:52.592
the aerosol monkey

14:52.625 --> 14:53.526
on his back.

14:53.560 --> 14:55.528
Logan, you need to tell us
what happened

14:55.562 --> 14:58.598
on that roof.

14:58.631 --> 15:01.001
I don't know how to
dumb this down for you any more.

15:01.034 --> 15:04.404
It wasn't me.

15:04.437 --> 15:06.606
You sprayed your name
at the crime scene.

15:06.639 --> 15:08.241
Someone ripped off my tag.

15:08.275 --> 15:10.143
Yeah, he went into
a dangerous neighborhood,

15:10.177 --> 15:12.645
risked his neck climbing up
those girders

15:12.679 --> 15:14.281
just to hand you the credit?

15:14.314 --> 15:15.615
Why would he do that?

15:15.648 --> 15:17.050
I don't know.

15:17.084 --> 15:19.419
People just like
screwing with me.

15:19.452 --> 15:20.653
Story of my life.

15:20.687 --> 15:22.155
Logan, we understand
that you're scared.

15:22.189 --> 15:24.191
I'm not scared! I'm pissed!
So maybe you think

15:24.224 --> 15:25.692
you're in too deep
and you can't get out.

15:25.725 --> 15:29.129
Look, sometimes there are
extenuating circumstances.

15:29.162 --> 15:30.430
(Benson)
You just need
to be straight with us.

15:30.463 --> 15:31.498
Tell us exactly

15:31.531 --> 15:32.599
what happened up there,

15:32.632 --> 15:34.034
and this will be okay.

15:34.067 --> 15:35.568
There's nothing to tell!

15:35.602 --> 15:36.703
I was home in my bed.

15:36.736 --> 15:38.638
So we should talk
to your parents.

15:38.671 --> 15:40.173
How would they know what I do?
They don't give a crap.

15:40.207 --> 15:42.242
Logan--
Do you get off
torturing people like this?

15:42.275 --> 15:43.710
Relax, sit down.
Get me out of here!

15:43.743 --> 15:46.713
Help!
Get me out of here!

15:46.746 --> 15:48.648
[muted by the glass]
Get me out of here!

15:48.681 --> 15:49.516
I called you in
because he was wigging out

15:49.549 --> 15:52.119
after Elliot and Olivia
collared him.

15:52.152 --> 15:53.453
What do you think?

15:53.486 --> 15:55.588
Aside from his anger issues,

15:55.622 --> 15:58.992
he's paranoid and unstable.

15:59.026 --> 16:01.194
Why is he in there
without a parent?

16:01.228 --> 16:03.030
They're on their way.
You're forgetting

16:03.063 --> 16:04.531
I used to be a cop.

16:04.564 --> 16:07.600
They're in there practically
spoon-feeding him Self Defense.

16:07.634 --> 16:10.403
He's an underage suspect.

16:10.437 --> 16:11.504
You're manipulating
the situation

16:11.538 --> 16:14.074
to get a confession out of
an emotionally disturbed boy

16:14.107 --> 16:17.110
without an advocate
in his corner.

16:17.144 --> 16:18.745
Captain, the kid's parents
are here.

16:18.778 --> 16:20.347
Put 'em in my office.

16:20.380 --> 16:21.648
He needs them in there.

16:21.681 --> 16:24.717
And I need to hear their account
of Logan's movements that night

16:24.751 --> 16:27.687
before he gets to talk to them.

16:29.456 --> 16:32.125
Mr. and Mrs. Stanton,
thank you for coming down.

16:32.159 --> 16:33.560
There's been a horrible mistake.

16:33.593 --> 16:35.195
Tell him, Lindsay.

16:35.228 --> 16:37.430
This is Logan's twin sister.

16:37.464 --> 16:40.267
My brother was home.
I saw him.

16:40.300 --> 16:43.303
I saw him when I got up
and went into his room.

16:43.336 --> 16:45.172
In the middle of the night?

16:45.205 --> 16:47.640
He always falls asleep
with his TV blaring.

16:47.674 --> 16:49.076
It woke me up.

16:49.109 --> 16:51.144
Now, what time was this?
2:30.

16:51.178 --> 16:52.179
2:34.

16:52.212 --> 16:55.382
I remember thinking,
"2, 3, 4," right in order.

16:55.415 --> 16:56.649
(Cragen)
Well, just because

16:56.683 --> 16:58.751
his TV was on,
doesn't mean he was in there.

16:58.785 --> 17:00.587
I went in to turn it off.

17:00.620 --> 17:03.090
He threw a book at me,
he called me "Butt-face,"

17:03.123 --> 17:05.592
and he told me
to get the hell out.

17:05.625 --> 17:09.462
Well, in that case,
this should be easy to clear up.

17:09.496 --> 17:10.630
Will you authorize
a DNA swab?

17:10.663 --> 17:12.199
Absolutely.

17:12.232 --> 17:13.700
But our attorney says that Logan

17:13.733 --> 17:15.502
shouldn't say
another word to you.

17:20.740 --> 17:22.609
I hear the DNA came back
on Logan Stanton.

17:22.642 --> 17:24.611
Perfect match to the saliva
on the bite marks.

17:24.644 --> 17:26.179
He was on that roof with Luis.

17:26.213 --> 17:27.347
Well, what do we do now?

17:27.380 --> 17:29.749
Well, "we" thought
it would be more humane

17:29.782 --> 17:31.218
not to pick him up
at his school,

17:31.251 --> 17:32.219
so we're picking him up
at his house.

17:32.252 --> 17:33.620
How many children
have you had

17:33.653 --> 17:35.755
who caused the death
of their attackers?

17:35.788 --> 17:37.857
You have to appreciate how much
that compounds the trauma

17:37.890 --> 17:39.058
of the sexual assault.

17:39.092 --> 17:41.794
And you have to appreciate
that this is an open homicide.

17:41.828 --> 17:43.496
He's gonna have to work with us.

17:43.530 --> 17:45.398
I don't have to tell you
the staggering statistics

17:45.432 --> 17:46.466
on how few boys

17:46.499 --> 17:47.467
report their rapes.

17:47.500 --> 17:48.468
No, you don't.

17:48.501 --> 17:49.569
And there might be
other factors.

17:49.602 --> 17:50.803
If Logan is homosexual,

17:50.837 --> 17:52.739
he may feel he somehow
brought it on himself.

17:52.772 --> 17:54.741
He's coming to terms
with his sexuality,

17:54.774 --> 17:56.709
he's conflicted,
it's a theory.

17:56.743 --> 17:59.078
Mind if I come with you?

18:03.150 --> 18:04.784
(Mrs. Stanton)
Doesn't make sense.

18:04.817 --> 18:06.553
Logan, get down here!

18:06.586 --> 18:09.422
Well, obviously Logan
had Lindsay lie for him.

18:09.456 --> 18:11.691
This is a nightmare.

18:11.724 --> 18:14.161
(Mr. Stanton)
Logan, you have to
tell these people

18:14.194 --> 18:15.162
the truth.

18:15.195 --> 18:16.496
No one's blaming you.

18:16.529 --> 18:18.431
They're here to help you.

18:18.465 --> 18:20.433
What the hell
are you talking about?

18:20.467 --> 18:21.268
(Mrs. Stanton)
Why did you lie to us?

18:21.301 --> 18:23.903
You swore
on your grandmother's grave

18:23.936 --> 18:25.238
it wasn't you.

18:25.272 --> 18:26.473
It wasn't!

18:26.506 --> 18:28.241
What's going on?

18:28.275 --> 18:29.609
(Benson)
Logan.

18:29.642 --> 18:30.777
You're gonna have to
come with us.

18:30.810 --> 18:32.845
Where are you taking him?
Mom!

18:32.879 --> 18:34.447
Why won't you listen to me?

18:34.481 --> 18:35.915
(Hendrix)
I can listen to everything

18:35.948 --> 18:38.318
you have to say.
Who the hell are you?

18:38.351 --> 18:39.552
I'm a psychiatrist.

18:40.753 --> 18:41.854
Logan--

18:41.888 --> 18:43.490
[groans]

18:43.523 --> 18:45.692
I told you no more shrinks!

18:45.725 --> 18:46.426
No, Logan!

18:46.459 --> 18:48.461
Relax.

18:48.495 --> 18:50.430
Get your hands off of him!

18:50.463 --> 18:51.798
(Mrs. Stanton)
Lindsay!

18:51.831 --> 18:53.666
(Benson)
Are you okay?

18:53.700 --> 18:54.834
Yeah, I'm fine.

18:54.867 --> 18:55.635
Emergency Services?

18:55.668 --> 18:57.670
Dr. Hendrix,
admitting two EDPs--

18:57.704 --> 18:58.905
This is all your fault!

18:58.938 --> 18:59.872
Why didn't you protect him?

18:59.906 --> 19:01.541
(Logan)
You said you just wanted
to help me!

19:01.574 --> 19:03.543
I knew you were lying!

19:03.576 --> 19:05.345
I knew it!

19:05.378 --> 19:07.714
Shh...shh...

19:10.950 --> 19:14.354
Pretty powerful swing
you've got there.

19:14.387 --> 19:17.790
You fractured
one of my partner's ribs.

19:17.824 --> 19:19.326
I'm sorry.

19:19.359 --> 19:23.396
Assaulting a police officer
is a very serious offense.

19:23.430 --> 19:24.631
I was trying
to protect my brother.

19:24.664 --> 19:26.266
We weren't there
to hurt him, Lindsay.

19:26.299 --> 19:28.401
Your brother is a victim
of a crime.

19:28.435 --> 19:31.671
No, he wasn't.

19:31.704 --> 19:33.873
I was.

19:36.609 --> 19:37.977
You were on the roof with him?

19:38.010 --> 19:39.646
No.

19:40.647 --> 19:42.715
I was alone.

19:44.817 --> 19:47.354
Lindsay.

19:47.387 --> 19:48.788
That's not possible.

19:50.257 --> 19:53.360
His writing crew
won't let girls in.

19:53.393 --> 19:55.262
I figure,

19:55.295 --> 19:58.298
if I put my tag someplace cool,
they'd have to take me.

19:58.331 --> 19:59.932
It was your brother's tag.

20:03.002 --> 20:04.704
I wanted them to be close.

20:04.737 --> 20:07.574
His is Syko.
Mine is Syke.

20:07.607 --> 20:09.909
With an "E."

20:09.942 --> 20:13.313
I just didn't get to finish.

20:22.655 --> 20:26.426
So tell me what happened.

20:28.295 --> 20:30.997
I had just finished the "K."

20:31.030 --> 20:34.801
When I felt this tug
on my leg.

20:37.470 --> 20:40.340
And he pulled me down
on this ramp.

20:40.373 --> 20:43.710
And he was about to punch me.

20:43.743 --> 20:47.046
And then he saw I was a girl.

20:47.079 --> 20:50.350
And he said he had
something better for me.

20:52.319 --> 20:55.988
And he unzipped his pants.

20:59.426 --> 21:01.928
So what did you do?

21:01.961 --> 21:06.699
I bit down as hard as I could.

21:06.733 --> 21:10.703
And he stumbled backwards
and fell off the edge.

21:12.839 --> 21:14.807
Is this what your brother
told you?

21:14.841 --> 21:16.376
No!

21:16.409 --> 21:18.311
It happened to me!

21:18.345 --> 21:20.513
Lindsay.

21:20.547 --> 21:23.583
That's not possible.

21:23.616 --> 21:25.485
It was your brother's DNA.

21:25.518 --> 21:28.888
The tests prove it.

21:31.924 --> 21:33.993
I have to talk to Logan.

21:34.026 --> 21:38.331
Please, you have to
let me see him, please.

21:38.365 --> 21:41.868
Why is she taking the blame
for him?

21:41.901 --> 21:43.403
They're twins.

21:43.436 --> 21:45.938
They develop closer bonds
than most siblings.

21:45.972 --> 21:47.106
There are documented cases

21:47.139 --> 21:49.776
where one twin
thousands of miles away

21:49.809 --> 21:52.612
knew the exact moment
when the other one died.

21:52.645 --> 21:55.548
What, Lindsay empathically
sensed when Logan was attacked?

21:55.582 --> 21:56.783
He obviously gave her
the details.

21:56.816 --> 21:58.885
But some twins are so enmeshed

21:58.918 --> 22:00.987
that Lindsay might actually feel
like she's the one

22:01.020 --> 22:01.988
who was attacked.

22:02.021 --> 22:03.456
Or Logan is the alpha twin,

22:03.490 --> 22:05.458
and he's coerced her
into covering for him.

22:05.492 --> 22:08.327
He's here.

22:13.866 --> 22:15.835
[sighs]

22:15.868 --> 22:18.137
You always let your sister
fight your battles for you?

22:18.170 --> 22:20.940
No.

22:20.973 --> 22:24.677
She nearly took me out
defending you.

22:24.711 --> 22:27.013
She was pissed.
Yeah?

22:27.046 --> 22:29.816
She knows you have
no business with me.

22:31.918 --> 22:34.487
Why is she trying
to take the fall for you?

22:34.521 --> 22:36.055
What are you talking about?

22:36.088 --> 22:37.390
She told us what happened
on that roof.

22:37.424 --> 22:39.158
She gave us details
only you could know.

22:39.191 --> 22:40.527
How could I tell her
about something

22:40.560 --> 22:41.894
that didn't even happen!

22:41.928 --> 22:45.432
I understand how difficult it is
to talk about this.

22:45.465 --> 22:47.467
But you're only making it worse
for yourself.

22:48.835 --> 22:50.437
I need to talk to Lindsay.

22:50.470 --> 22:51.904
Look.

22:51.938 --> 22:54.941
There's no reason
to drag your sister into this.

22:54.974 --> 22:56.409
I'm not saying another word

22:56.443 --> 22:59.946
'til you let me talk
to my sister.

22:59.979 --> 23:01.581
I think you should
put them together.

23:01.614 --> 23:04.451
This is a homicide
investigation.

23:04.484 --> 23:05.452
What could it hurt?

23:05.485 --> 23:07.520
They've already collaborated
on their stories.

23:07.554 --> 23:08.387
Excuse me.

23:08.421 --> 23:10.457
We got a statement yet?
(Benson)
Close.

23:10.490 --> 23:11.323
He channeled it
through his sister,

23:11.357 --> 23:13.460
but can't admit
that it happened to him.

23:13.493 --> 23:14.827
Kid was sodomized.
He's hung up on it.

23:14.861 --> 23:15.828
Well, does he realize

23:15.862 --> 23:17.597
he could be charged with murder?

23:17.630 --> 23:18.898
Everyone knows
this was self-defense.

23:18.931 --> 23:20.467
But if he used more force

23:20.500 --> 23:23.503
than necessary,
it's involuntary manslaughter.

23:23.536 --> 23:25.972
Casey, can I talk to you
in private?

23:28.841 --> 23:30.610
The twins were born here
at Bellevue.

23:30.643 --> 23:32.512
I just pulled
their medical files.

23:32.545 --> 23:34.046
You might want to subpoena them.

23:34.080 --> 23:35.915
Why? What's in there?

23:35.948 --> 23:37.016
Well, I can't say
they're at risk,

23:37.049 --> 23:38.518
but there are several red flags.

23:38.551 --> 23:39.519
You're asking me

23:39.552 --> 23:41.721
to get a subpoena
for a fishing expedition.

23:41.754 --> 23:43.189
I need specifics.

23:43.222 --> 23:44.991
I can't tell you.

23:45.024 --> 23:46.693
I can't help you.

23:46.726 --> 23:49.862
What if I tell you
what's not in there?

23:49.896 --> 23:52.832
I've never run across
anything like this.

23:52.865 --> 23:54.567
Entire chunks
have been redacted.

23:54.601 --> 23:55.367
Well, that usually means

23:55.401 --> 23:57.036
someone's trying
to hide something.

23:57.069 --> 23:59.739
So order the complete files.
I can't.

23:59.772 --> 24:00.973
Their therapist
pulled me off the case

24:01.007 --> 24:02.609
right after they were admitted.

24:02.642 --> 24:03.810
I've already
overstepped my bounds

24:03.843 --> 24:05.545
by reviewing these.

24:05.578 --> 24:08.615
If there is a case,
you've tainted it.
I had to find out

24:08.648 --> 24:10.617
why they've been seeing
this particular therapist.

24:10.650 --> 24:13.085
Why? Who is it?

24:13.119 --> 24:15.688
A sex therapist.

24:15.722 --> 24:18.625
What sexual problems
could these children have?

24:18.658 --> 24:21.528
They are abnormally close.

24:21.561 --> 24:24.163
Incest?
They're desperate

24:24.196 --> 24:25.498
to see each other.

24:25.532 --> 24:27.634
I want to see how they interact.

24:31.571 --> 24:36.175
I'm sorry for dragging you
into this.

24:36.208 --> 24:38.177
[whispers]

24:38.210 --> 24:39.912
No whispering.

24:39.946 --> 24:42.181
Well, can we talk in private
for a minute?

24:42.214 --> 24:43.082
(Benson)
We can't allow that.
Come on, Lindsay.

24:43.115 --> 24:47.620
Why don't we all sit down?
Logan, sit here.

24:50.089 --> 24:51.891
So let's talk about
who was on that roof.

24:51.924 --> 24:53.292
It was me.

24:57.163 --> 24:58.665
Crux nor lumbash.

24:58.698 --> 25:00.800
Strub?

25:00.833 --> 25:02.068
Crux nor lumbash.

25:02.101 --> 25:03.302
Tash no plix!
Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa.

25:03.335 --> 25:04.837
Time out. None of that.

25:04.871 --> 25:06.272
Spazdo carst.

25:06.305 --> 25:07.273
What the hell are they saying?

25:07.306 --> 25:08.741
It's a made-up language.

25:08.775 --> 25:10.242
My twins had one
when they were young.

25:10.276 --> 25:13.079
Clof ung zaust.
Disto woost.

25:13.112 --> 25:14.847
Lancton dinton carst in zu?
(Benson)
Hey, enough.

25:14.881 --> 25:17.684
Guys, English only.
Okay?

25:17.717 --> 25:19.185
[Logan continuing]

25:19.218 --> 25:20.553
No. No, no, no, no.
No more gibberish.

25:20.587 --> 25:22.622
Talk to us--
Dr. Hendrix.

25:22.655 --> 25:24.123
Dr. Blair.

25:24.156 --> 25:25.124
These are my patients.

25:25.157 --> 25:26.659
I thought I took you
off this case.

25:26.693 --> 25:28.661
The detectives
are interviewing them.

25:28.695 --> 25:30.029
I was just observing.

25:30.062 --> 25:32.164
I'm Casey Novak.
I'm the ADA on the case.

25:32.198 --> 25:34.033
So you are their therapist?
Yes.

25:34.066 --> 25:35.735
May I ask what you're
seeing them for?

25:35.768 --> 25:37.203
I'm afraid that's privileged.

25:37.236 --> 25:38.971
Have these detectives worked
with children before?

25:39.005 --> 25:40.206
It's their specialty.

25:40.239 --> 25:43.943
If you'll excuse me,
I think my patients need me.

25:45.878 --> 25:47.213
Well.

25:47.246 --> 25:49.782
I guess he won't be
working with us.

25:49.816 --> 25:51.651
(Novak)
Their doctor won't talk,
their parents won't talk.

25:51.684 --> 25:54.286
Who else is gonna know

25:54.320 --> 25:56.789
what's going on in this family?

26:00.627 --> 26:02.094
(woman)
I take care
of the Stanton's house,

26:02.128 --> 26:03.696
not the kids.

26:03.730 --> 26:04.831
How long have you been
with them?

26:04.864 --> 26:06.833
Eight years.

26:06.866 --> 26:09.636
It's a good job,
I would like to keep it.

26:09.669 --> 26:14.006
Would you say that Lindsay and
Logan are overly affectionate?

26:14.040 --> 26:17.644
Sometimes they go days
without speaking to each other.

26:17.677 --> 26:19.178
What's that about?

26:19.211 --> 26:20.747
Usually after
they see the doctor.

26:20.780 --> 26:23.616
You mean their therapist?

26:23.650 --> 26:24.483
When they come home,

26:24.516 --> 26:26.719
they lock themselves
in separate rooms.

26:26.753 --> 26:29.789
Won't even look at each other
at the dinner table.

26:29.822 --> 26:31.390
You ever ask them
what that's about?

26:31.423 --> 26:34.093
They went through
a lot of nannies.

26:34.126 --> 26:36.729
Talk to them.

26:38.197 --> 26:39.365
I was only with them
for six months.

26:39.398 --> 26:41.167
Know why they were seeing
a shrink?

26:41.200 --> 26:42.802
Well, I'd assume
it was over the fighting.

26:42.835 --> 26:44.671
With the parents?
Each other.

26:44.704 --> 26:47.306
They're violent little urchins.
I couldn't handle 'em.

26:47.339 --> 26:49.108
Fist fights, wrestling?

26:49.141 --> 26:51.678
Knock-down drag-outs.

26:51.711 --> 26:54.146
So Logan battered his sister?

26:54.180 --> 26:57.817
It was usually instigated
by Lindsay.

26:57.850 --> 26:59.752
(Benson)
So why was Lindsay so angry?

26:59.786 --> 27:01.821
There was so much tension
in the house.

27:01.854 --> 27:03.690
Was Logan ever...
inappropriate with her?

27:03.723 --> 27:06.158
No. It was the mother.

27:06.192 --> 27:08.327
Picked at her constantly.

27:08.360 --> 27:10.663
For what?
Everything.

27:10.697 --> 27:12.031
Her hair,
her clothes, makeup.

27:12.064 --> 27:15.668
And she'd force her
to take these pills.

27:15.702 --> 27:17.436
Said they were multivitamins.

27:17.469 --> 27:18.504
What do you think they were?

27:18.537 --> 27:22.675
All I know is A, they were
prescribed by a doctor.

27:22.709 --> 27:24.744
And B, I gave one to Logan once.

27:24.777 --> 27:26.679
Mrs. Stanton went ballistic.

27:26.713 --> 27:29.281
Was Lindsay sick a lot?

27:29.315 --> 27:31.450
Poor little thing was always
in and out of the hospitals.

27:31.483 --> 27:33.753
But that was back
when she was a toddler.

27:33.786 --> 27:34.854
What was wrong with her?

27:34.887 --> 27:36.689
Chronic bladder infections.

27:36.723 --> 27:39.759
That's a lot of female trouble
for such a little girl.

27:39.792 --> 27:40.727
Never kept her down, though.

27:40.760 --> 27:42.995
She was a handful.

27:43.029 --> 27:45.464
Always running around the house
buck naked.

27:45.497 --> 27:48.334
Who undressed her?
She did.

27:48.367 --> 27:50.703
Her mom would buy her
the cutest dresses,

27:50.737 --> 27:53.305
and she would just
rip 'em right off.

27:56.475 --> 28:00.913
You know, she did have
some scars down there

28:00.947 --> 28:05.317
in her...little area.

28:05.351 --> 28:06.953
(Mr. Stanton)
Lindsay suffered

28:06.986 --> 28:08.254
from urinary reflux.

28:08.287 --> 28:10.757
She eventually had to
have surgery.

28:10.790 --> 28:13.492
Well, that might explain
the internal vaginal scarring.

28:13.525 --> 28:14.927
But not the external.

28:16.428 --> 28:17.897
I don't know
where you're getting this.

28:17.930 --> 28:19.498
My daughter doesn't have
any scars.

28:19.531 --> 28:22.034
Right, and you're not slipping
her birth control pills.

28:22.068 --> 28:23.736
Why would I?
My daughter's 14.

28:23.770 --> 28:25.304
She's not sexually active.

28:25.337 --> 28:26.806
Well, we know that
you're giving her something.

28:26.839 --> 28:28.340
Weight loss pills.

28:28.374 --> 28:30.409
(Stabler)
Why are you telling her
they're vitamins?

28:30.442 --> 28:34.280
She's very...self-conscious
about her...appearance.

28:34.313 --> 28:35.848
And we're just trying to help.

28:35.882 --> 28:37.483
Well, we understand
that you sent her

28:37.516 --> 28:39.118
to a sex therapist.

28:39.151 --> 28:41.888
Along with her brother.

28:44.456 --> 28:46.092
Is there something going on
between them?

28:46.125 --> 28:47.526
Sexually?

28:47.559 --> 28:50.763
Oh, my God.
Of course not.

28:50.797 --> 28:52.131
If you know they're having sex,

28:52.164 --> 28:53.866
and you've allowed it
to continue under your roof,

28:53.900 --> 28:55.101
we can arrest both of you

28:55.134 --> 28:56.969
for endangering the welfare
of your children.

28:57.003 --> 28:59.338
Okay. We're done here.

28:59.371 --> 29:03.442
Get out of my house.

29:05.845 --> 29:07.513
That pushed some buttons.

29:07.546 --> 29:09.181
He's just pissed
they ran out of excuses.

29:09.215 --> 29:10.382
Detectives!

29:10.416 --> 29:13.285
I overheard you
with Mr. and Mrs. Stanton.

29:13.319 --> 29:15.387
You're wrong about them.

29:15.421 --> 29:17.456
You're wrong about the children.

29:17.489 --> 29:19.025
So why don't you
set us straight?

29:19.058 --> 29:20.793
A couple of weeks ago,

29:20.827 --> 29:23.529
Mrs. Stanton was so upset,
she had to be sedated.

29:23.562 --> 29:24.530
Why?

29:24.563 --> 29:28.334
She caught Lindsay
in a very passionate kiss.

29:28.367 --> 29:30.569
With her brother.

29:30.602 --> 29:35.274
No.
Another girl.

29:35.307 --> 29:36.342
Lindsay's a lesbian?

29:36.375 --> 29:39.445
That kinda blows the incest
theory out of the water.

29:39.478 --> 29:41.547
Not necessarily.
Maybe it was non-consensual.

29:41.580 --> 29:43.950
Would explain her violence
towards Logan

29:43.983 --> 29:45.584
and his control over her.

29:45.617 --> 29:48.387
And send her to the other team.
(Hendrix)
Detectives.

29:48.420 --> 29:50.322
(Benson)
You've got something.

29:50.356 --> 29:52.224
You're looking at
the wrong person.

29:52.258 --> 29:54.360
It wasn't Logan on the roof.

29:54.393 --> 29:55.895
Well, who do you think
it was?

29:55.928 --> 29:58.097
Lindsay.

29:58.130 --> 30:01.067
Well, that's not possible.
DNA doesn't lie.

30:01.100 --> 30:03.569
The twins were born
July 14th, 1990.

30:03.602 --> 30:05.271
Lindsay's birth certificate
was re-issued

30:05.304 --> 30:07.339
six months later.
Why is that?

30:07.373 --> 30:09.341
That's what I wanted to know.

30:09.375 --> 30:12.011
I had no right to, but--

30:12.044 --> 30:15.214
I pulled Amelia Stanton's
hospital records.

30:15.247 --> 30:19.886
"Baby Boy A"
and "Baby Boy B"?

30:19.919 --> 30:21.487
She gave birth
to identical twins.

30:21.520 --> 30:23.522
Lindsay's genetically male.

30:23.555 --> 30:26.592
Was there any defect
or deformity?
No.

30:26.625 --> 30:29.929
Amelia Stanton gave birth
to two perfectly healthy boys.

30:29.962 --> 30:32.431
What the hell
did they do to her?

30:32.464 --> 30:35.935
You mean him.

30:39.171 --> 30:40.039
What happened?

30:40.072 --> 30:41.373
You just had to have
a boy and a girl?

30:41.407 --> 30:42.875
It was a freak accident.

30:42.909 --> 30:46.312
They do it
hundreds of times a day.

30:46.345 --> 30:48.014
It's supposed to be
a routine procedure.

30:48.047 --> 30:49.348
What?

30:49.381 --> 30:51.417
Circumcision.

30:52.418 --> 30:54.453
They took off too much?

30:55.955 --> 30:59.425
They use, um,
some sort of device...

30:59.458 --> 31:01.327
to remove the foreskin.

31:01.360 --> 31:02.528
It malfunctioned.

31:02.561 --> 31:04.596
Burned him severely.

31:04.630 --> 31:06.098
We spoke to all the experts.

31:06.132 --> 31:10.436
And they all said
that he would never be normal.

31:12.004 --> 31:14.206
He--he could've stayed a boy.

31:14.240 --> 31:16.943
Never a fully functioning one.

31:16.976 --> 31:18.978
Couldn't they have given him
a prosthesis?

31:19.011 --> 31:20.312
(Mrs. Stanton)
Not until puberty.

31:21.613 --> 31:23.983
And even then--

31:24.016 --> 31:25.517
it would never fool anyone.

31:25.551 --> 31:27.319
(Mr. Stanton)
Imagine the abuse he'd take

31:27.353 --> 31:30.422
in locker rooms.

31:30.456 --> 31:32.291
The humiliation of explaining it

31:32.324 --> 31:35.527
to the girl
he fell in love with.

31:37.629 --> 31:40.466
We couldn't put him
through that.

31:40.499 --> 31:42.668
You thought
a sex change operation

31:42.701 --> 31:44.570
would be easier on him?

31:44.603 --> 31:48.374
What else could we do?

31:48.407 --> 31:51.177
Dr. Blair convinced us
it was the only hope

31:51.210 --> 31:52.678
our child had for a normal life.

31:52.711 --> 31:53.645
(Mr. Stanton)
He found us

31:53.679 --> 31:56.015
the leading surgeon
in sex reassignments.

31:56.048 --> 31:57.383
He promised us

31:57.416 --> 31:59.351
that it would work.

31:59.385 --> 32:01.353
He promised us.

32:01.387 --> 32:06.558
As long as we were committed
to raising her as a girl.

32:10.596 --> 32:12.631
(Blair)
Any plastic surgeon
will tell you

32:12.664 --> 32:15.567
it's easier to dig a hole
than build a pole.

32:15.601 --> 32:17.603
I don't think it's quite
that simple for Lindsay.

32:17.636 --> 32:19.305
It entailed a few operations.

32:19.338 --> 32:22.474
A suprapubic cystotomy
to enable urination.

32:22.508 --> 32:24.010
Removal of the testes.

32:24.043 --> 32:25.377
And of course a penectomy

32:25.411 --> 32:27.446
for the remaining
penile tissue.

32:27.479 --> 32:29.748
Slap a bow on her,
call her a girl, huh?

32:29.781 --> 32:31.350
And, uh,
those special "vitamins"

32:31.383 --> 32:33.352
that her parents are shoving
down her throat?

32:33.385 --> 32:34.486
Estrogen, right?

32:34.520 --> 32:35.721
Starting at puberty,
it's important

32:35.754 --> 32:37.589
she develop
feminine characteristics.

32:37.623 --> 32:39.425
You mean breasts.
And hips.

32:39.458 --> 32:40.759
It's all a part of the package.

32:40.792 --> 32:42.061
In order for the experiment
to work,

32:42.094 --> 32:45.364
she has to look like a girl.

32:45.397 --> 32:46.665
Be treated like a girl.

32:46.698 --> 32:48.534
And taught to act like a girl.

32:48.567 --> 32:50.669
Your "experiment" didn't work.

32:50.702 --> 32:52.204
I disagree.

32:52.238 --> 32:53.539
Lindsay's...miserable.

32:53.572 --> 32:55.674
What 14-year-old girl isn't?

32:55.707 --> 32:58.077
Mister, you can't change
someone's sexual identity.

32:58.110 --> 32:59.511
Children are born
psycho-sexually neutral,

32:59.545 --> 33:02.248
a blank slate.

33:02.281 --> 33:07.019
Gender identity is determined
by nurture, not nature.

33:07.053 --> 33:09.121
Just because you raise
a boy as a girl

33:09.155 --> 33:10.322
doesn't make him one.

33:10.356 --> 33:12.491
That's because he still
is physically a boy,

33:12.524 --> 33:13.759
and therefore can't be
completely

33:13.792 --> 33:15.694
and objectively
treated as a girl.

33:15.727 --> 33:18.764
Lindsay was physically
made female.

33:18.797 --> 33:21.267
Treated as a female.

33:21.300 --> 33:23.135
And believes she is a female.

33:23.169 --> 33:25.104
That's insane.

33:26.638 --> 33:28.774
I'm curious,
only a handful of people

33:28.807 --> 33:30.542
know about Lindsay's
transformation.

33:30.576 --> 33:32.511
And for her own good,
they never talk about it.

33:32.544 --> 33:33.612
How did you find out?

33:33.645 --> 33:34.746
Confidential.

33:34.780 --> 33:36.215
That information came to us

33:36.248 --> 33:38.417
during the course
of a criminal investigation.

33:38.450 --> 33:42.088
I assume you'll be dropping
those charges against Logan.

33:42.121 --> 33:44.090
I discharged him
from the hospital.

33:44.123 --> 33:47.059
Well, surely you can appreciate
our confusion.

33:47.093 --> 33:49.461
Our ADA is gonna take
a statement from Lindsay

33:49.495 --> 33:52.264
and I think that's gonna raise
a few questions for her.

33:52.298 --> 33:54.233
It is imperative
that she never be told

33:54.266 --> 33:56.068
she was born a boy.

33:56.102 --> 33:58.537
You don't think
that's gonna come out now?

33:58.570 --> 34:01.107
Not if I can help it.

34:01.140 --> 34:05.577
For her welfare, I insist
I be allowed to be there.

34:05.611 --> 34:10.449
(Lindsay)
And that's...
everything that happened.

34:10.482 --> 34:13.419
He tried to rape me.

34:13.452 --> 34:16.622
I bit him,
and he fell off the roof.

34:16.655 --> 34:19.125
It wa self-defense.

34:19.158 --> 34:21.660
I'm not gonna press charges.

34:21.693 --> 34:25.564
You just need to sign
your statement.

34:28.734 --> 34:30.602
But I don't understand.

34:32.504 --> 34:33.472
Just sign it, Lindsay.

34:33.505 --> 34:35.541
Then we can put
this unpleasantness behind us.

34:35.574 --> 34:39.211
But you said my brother
had to do it.

34:39.245 --> 34:41.247
(Blair)
They were wrong.

34:41.280 --> 34:42.514
Well, how could that happen?

34:42.548 --> 34:44.450
You gonna take this one, Doctor?

34:44.483 --> 34:46.585
It's very complicated, Lindsay.

34:46.618 --> 34:48.387
Stop it!

34:48.420 --> 34:49.555
Could you just tell me
what's going on?

34:49.588 --> 34:51.290
I feel like I'm going crazy!

34:51.323 --> 34:55.527
Dr. Blair.
Can I have a word with you?

34:55.561 --> 34:57.229
This is not a good time.

34:57.263 --> 34:58.664
I'm afraid I'm gonna
have to insist.

34:58.697 --> 34:59.898
And I'm afraid I'm going to

34:59.931 --> 35:01.267
have to ask you to leave.

35:01.300 --> 35:02.668
You know something, don't you?

35:02.701 --> 35:04.803
You've got to tell her.

35:04.836 --> 35:06.172
The only thing I have to do

35:06.205 --> 35:08.374
is report your unprofessional
conduct

35:08.407 --> 35:10.642
to the Medical Review Board.

35:16.548 --> 35:18.717
Please!

35:22.454 --> 35:24.890
You were born a boy.

35:29.495 --> 35:31.230
How?

35:31.263 --> 35:34.600
Dr. Hendrix!
There was an accident
right after you were born.

35:34.633 --> 35:35.767
Lindsay, don't listen
to anything

35:35.801 --> 35:38.937
they're telling you.
Shut up!

35:38.970 --> 35:40.372
I knew it!

35:40.406 --> 35:42.441
I never once felt right!

35:42.474 --> 35:43.675
I always thought I was a freak!

35:43.709 --> 35:45.877
(Blair)
You are a perfectly
normal girl.

35:45.911 --> 35:47.613
You've got to hold onto that.

35:47.646 --> 35:49.281
Why didn't anybody tell me?

35:49.315 --> 35:50.382
Why didn't you tell me?

35:50.416 --> 35:51.817
It was for your own good.

35:53.652 --> 35:55.387
What was my name?

35:55.421 --> 35:57.189
That's not important.
We can't go backwards now!

35:57.223 --> 35:59.225
What was my name?

35:59.258 --> 36:01.893
Your name was Lucas.

36:04.630 --> 36:08.467
[sobs]

36:08.500 --> 36:11.670
You are finished.

36:19.911 --> 36:21.680
You spring cleaning?

36:21.713 --> 36:24.916
Seems I've lost
my privileges here.

36:24.950 --> 36:27.986
Dr. Blair made good
on his threat.

36:28.019 --> 36:29.755
Gives me time to prepare
for the hearing

36:29.788 --> 36:31.890
over my license.

36:31.923 --> 36:34.326
I'm sorry--
You did the right thing.

36:34.360 --> 36:38.264
For a cop.

36:38.297 --> 36:40.666
Look, the good news is, Lindsay
has stopped taking estrogen.

36:40.699 --> 36:42.768
She's decided--

36:42.801 --> 36:45.671
He's decided to change back
to his true genetic gender.

36:45.704 --> 36:47.939
[cell phone ringing]
Benson.

36:47.973 --> 36:50.342
A lot of painful operations
ahead for her.

36:50.376 --> 36:52.811
At least the right person's
finally making the choice.

36:54.646 --> 36:57.916
Cragen wants us back
at the house.

36:59.651 --> 37:01.620
Take care.

37:12.831 --> 37:15.867
Logan would like us
to file charges.

37:15.901 --> 37:18.370
(Benson)
Against whom?

37:20.038 --> 37:22.674
Dr. Blair.

37:24.476 --> 37:26.912
Well, I-I think
his theories are dangerous,

37:26.945 --> 37:28.680
but unfortunately,
they're not illegal.

37:28.714 --> 37:29.881
He and your parents

37:29.915 --> 37:32.818
did what they thought
was best for Lindsay.

37:32.851 --> 37:34.786
He molested us.

37:36.522 --> 37:37.989
He says it's been going on
for years.

37:40.892 --> 37:43.795
Okay.

37:43.829 --> 37:45.564
What'd he do to you?

37:45.597 --> 37:48.700
He used to show us pictures.

37:48.734 --> 37:51.337
Of adults having sex.

37:53.705 --> 37:55.407
Did he touch you?

37:57.643 --> 38:01.780
Just to put us
into our positions.

38:01.813 --> 38:04.716
It's okay, Logan.

38:04.750 --> 38:07.719
You just tell 'em
what he did next.

38:10.489 --> 38:14.560
H-he used to make
me and my sister...

38:14.593 --> 38:16.795
like...

38:16.828 --> 38:19.898
pretend we were having sex.

38:24.936 --> 38:26.705
It was part of their treatment.

38:26.738 --> 38:27.573
(Stabler)
Something tells me

38:27.606 --> 38:29.541
you got more out of it
than they did.

38:29.575 --> 38:30.809
It was important to
differentiate

38:30.842 --> 38:32.578
their gender roles.

38:32.611 --> 38:33.545
Hers had to be learned.

38:33.579 --> 38:34.946
Well, there was nothing wrong
with Logan.

38:34.980 --> 38:36.382
Why was he there?

38:36.415 --> 38:37.883
He had to be there.
They're identical twins.

38:37.916 --> 38:40.852
Which makes him the perfect
experimental control.

38:40.886 --> 38:43.389
They're living proof
that nurture, not nature,

38:43.422 --> 38:44.856
determines sexuality.

38:44.890 --> 38:46.992
And what did making them
have sex with each other prove?

38:47.025 --> 38:49.561
Please.
There was never penetration.

38:49.595 --> 38:51.897
But it did the job
for you, right?

38:51.930 --> 38:53.399
It clarified things for Lindsay.

38:53.432 --> 38:54.666
She had to be programmed.

38:54.700 --> 38:56.935
It's perfectly natural
for young children

38:56.968 --> 38:58.470
to explore each other's bodies.

38:58.504 --> 39:00.038
Dr. Blair, do you realize

39:00.071 --> 39:02.541
that disseminating pornography
to a minor is a felony?

39:02.574 --> 39:04.443
I showed them art books.

39:04.476 --> 39:05.844
Doc, I saw the art

39:05.877 --> 39:07.779
in your office,
and even I was uncomfortable

39:07.813 --> 39:09.948
at how many phalluses
were on display.

39:09.981 --> 39:11.850
That's because you're
a bourgeois American,

39:11.883 --> 39:13.385
completely uptight about sex.

39:13.419 --> 39:14.786
It's what screws up
your children

39:14.820 --> 39:17.122
and turns them
into sex offenders.

39:17.155 --> 39:19.425
You lost me at bourgeois.

39:19.458 --> 39:20.659
So you're saying

39:20.692 --> 39:23.695
that children would be healthier
if they were sexually active.

39:23.729 --> 39:24.763
(Blair)
All I'm saying

39:24.796 --> 39:25.831
is people should be more open

39:25.864 --> 39:28.734
about the human body,
and not put taboos on it.

39:28.767 --> 39:30.836
So you're not denying
any of the allegations

39:30.869 --> 39:32.904
that Logan made
against your practices.

39:32.938 --> 39:34.540
Denying them?

39:34.573 --> 39:36.808
I'm writing a book about them.

39:41.947 --> 39:44.816
Did it come in yet?

39:44.850 --> 39:48.987
$6,000, courtesy
of the Crime Victim Boards.

39:49.020 --> 39:50.789
Thank you.

39:50.822 --> 39:52.658
I know how hard it is
to get this released

39:52.691 --> 39:53.892
to a non-family member.

39:53.925 --> 39:57.863
But now I can give Katie
a proper burial.

39:57.896 --> 39:58.897
Blair made bail this morning.

39:58.930 --> 40:00.432
He can afford it.

40:00.466 --> 40:02.601
I'm surprised he sat in jail
for three days.

40:02.634 --> 40:03.869
Wheels of justice move slowly.

40:03.902 --> 40:05.737
Especially when a file clerk
friend of mine

40:05.771 --> 40:07.806
misplaces the paperwork.

40:07.839 --> 40:08.840
Nice.

40:08.874 --> 40:10.509
(Sister)
Have they set a trail date

40:10.542 --> 40:13.011
for Katie's killer yet?
Yes, March 3rd.

40:13.044 --> 40:15.547
But we're gonna need to go over
your testimony before that.

40:15.581 --> 40:16.982
She's been receiving threats.

40:17.015 --> 40:18.984
She's the only one
who can I.D. Hector Ramirez.

40:19.017 --> 40:21.119
We really appreciate
you doing this.

40:21.152 --> 40:24.623
At least I'll be giving Katie
a voice in the courtroom.

40:24.656 --> 40:26.558
Stabler.

40:26.592 --> 40:28.594
What?

40:28.627 --> 40:31.062
We'll be right there.

40:31.096 --> 40:34.466
Dr. Blair's been murdered.

40:39.170 --> 40:41.607
Someone bashed his brains in.

40:41.640 --> 40:43.542
Left the murder weapon.

40:43.575 --> 40:44.543
Any prints?

40:44.576 --> 40:46.044
Mm-mm.

40:46.077 --> 40:48.480
We probably got DNA.

40:48.514 --> 40:50.081
Was he raped?

40:50.115 --> 40:54.185
Killer spit on him.
I found traces of dried saliva.

40:54.219 --> 40:55.754
(man)
Detectives.

40:55.787 --> 40:58.056
This is from the security camera
in the hallway.

41:08.600 --> 41:11.136
Is that Lindsay or Logan?

41:17.976 --> 41:20.946
Still got the hood up,
can't tell.

41:23.882 --> 41:26.885
So which one killed Blair?
Lindsay or Logan?

41:26.918 --> 41:28.820
He's only answering to Luke now.

41:28.854 --> 41:29.921
(Benson)
We've been grilling them
for hours.

41:29.955 --> 41:31.523
Their stories are locked.

41:31.557 --> 41:32.390
They went to a movie together,

41:32.423 --> 41:33.759
they got the ticket stubs
to prove it.

41:33.792 --> 41:34.826
Double feature.

41:34.860 --> 41:36.662
Alibis one of them
through the time of the murder.

41:36.695 --> 41:37.929
Why only one?

41:37.963 --> 41:39.264
(Stable)
An usher remembers
seeing two kids

41:39.297 --> 41:40.165
with matching parkas,

41:40.198 --> 41:41.933
one of them left
during the second reel.

41:41.967 --> 41:42.934
And he has no idea which one.

41:42.968 --> 41:45.170
We already have the DNA
from the original case.

41:45.203 --> 41:46.171
We know it's gonna be
one of 'em.

41:46.204 --> 41:49.541
Identical twins,
identical DNA.

41:49.575 --> 41:50.909
Yeah, but Lindsay
was taking estrogen.

41:50.942 --> 41:53.078
That's gotta distinguish
hers from his.

41:53.111 --> 41:54.913
She stopped taking it.
Five days ago.

41:54.946 --> 41:56.815
Which is exactly
the amount of time needed

41:56.848 --> 41:58.149
for it to work its way
out of her system.

41:58.183 --> 42:00.619
(Benson)
Could we charge both of them?

42:00.652 --> 42:02.120
(Novak)
And what?
Have two separate trials?

42:02.153 --> 42:03.254
Dual theories of the crime

42:03.288 --> 42:05.624
give each of them
grounds for dismissal.

42:05.657 --> 42:07.826
They came up
with the perfect crime.

42:07.859 --> 42:09.995
Until you get one of them
to flip.

42:10.028 --> 42:12.631
That's not gonna happen.

42:12.664 --> 42:15.100
They're way too close.
