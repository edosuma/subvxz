DID YOU EVER
HEAR OF A TIP?

16:16.476 --> 16:17.966
A TIP?

16:18.060 --> 16:19.471
OH YEAH,
HERE'S A TIP.

16:19.562 --> 16:22.805
DON'T PLAY
WITH MATCHES.

16:22.899 --> 16:25.311
JERK.

16:27.153 --> 16:29.485
THIS DOESN'T HAVE TO STOP
AT THE RACES EITHER.

16:29.572 --> 16:33.440
IT COULD BE FOOTBALL GAMES,
BASEBALL, BASKETBALL-

16:35.870 --> 16:36.985
WHAT IS THIS?

16:44.629 --> 16:48.418
WHY, THAT
OLD CRUM BUM.

16:48.508 --> 16:50.090
I'LL FIX HIM.

16:50.134 --> 16:52.000
I'LL TAKE IT OUT OF
HIS LOUSY OLD HIDE.

16:56.432 --> 16:59.424
HE IS A LITTLE CRUM
BUM- TO TRY THIS ON ME.

17:04.607 --> 17:05.972
THANK YOU.

17:14.617 --> 17:16.574
HEY, YOU.

17:16.661 --> 17:18.151
HEY, PARTNER.

17:18.246 --> 17:21.364

MR. RENARD?

17:30.299 --> 17:32.791
THAT PEN, IT DON'T
VVORK, NO INK COMES OUT.

17:32.885 --> 17:35.263
I CAN'T PICK
ANY WINNERS.

17:35.346 --> 17:38.964
<i>WELL, YOU WANT A GREAT DEAL, MR.
RENARD.</i>

17:39.058 --> 17:42.392
THE THINGS YOU NEED,
YOU ONLY NEED ONCE.

17:42.478 --> 17:44.219
JUST ONCE.

17:44.313 --> 17:48.307
THAT'S ALL
THEY'RE EVER NEEDED.

17:48.359 --> 17:50.817
OKAY. WHAT'S
NEXT, THEN?

17:50.861 --> 17:53.148
NOTHING IS NEXT.

17:53.197 --> 17:55.985
I'D RATHER NOT SELL
YOU ANYTHING MORE.

17:57.660 --> 18:01.528
IS THAT A FACT?

18:01.622 --> 18:04.080
PIDOTT, I VVANT TO TELL
YOU SOMETHING ABOUT ME.

18:04.166 --> 18:06.828
I VVAS BORN UNDER A LOUSY
ZODIAC OR SOMETHING.

18:06.919 --> 18:09.081
I'VE BEEN GETTING THE
DIRTY END OF THE STICK

18:09.171 --> 18:10.753
EVER SINCE I WAS
FOUR YEARS OLD.

18:10.840 --> 18:14.333
I FEEL SORRY FOR
YOU, I REALLY DO.

18:14.427 --> 18:16.384
I DON'T
WANT YOU TO.

18:16.470 --> 18:18.757
I DON'T VVANT YOU TO GO
TO THAT KIND OF TROUBLE.

18:18.848 --> 18:22.091
I JUST VVANT YOU TO KEEP
SUPPLYING ME VVITH VVHAT I NEED.

18:22.184 --> 18:23.561

18:23.644 --> 18:25.305
SCISSORS TO SAVE
MY LOUSY HIDE,

18:25.396 --> 18:27.558
OR A LEAKY FOUNTAIN PEN
SO I CAN PICK WINNERS.

18:27.648 --> 18:30.731
WHATEVER IT IS, I WANT
IT TO KEEP COMING.

18:30.818 --> 18:33.526
I DON'T WANT
IT TO STOP.

18:33.613 --> 18:35.695
THAT'S A PITY.

18:35.781 --> 18:38.068
BECAUSE IT
MUST STOP.

18:38.159 --> 18:40.400
IT MUST STOP NOW.

18:42.413 --> 18:45.121
WHO? WHY?

18:45.207 --> 18:47.539
WHY DOES IT
HAVE TO STOP?

18:47.627 --> 18:51.871
BECAUSE THE THINGS
YOU NEED MOST,

18:51.964 --> 18:53.705
I CAN'T SUPPLY.

18:53.799 --> 18:57.042
W-W-WHAT ARE TH EY?

18:57.136 --> 19:02.051
SERENITY, PEACE
OF MIND, HUMOR--

19:02.141 --> 19:07.056
THE ABILITY TO
LAUGH AT ONESELF.

19:07.104 --> 19:10.438
THOSE ARE THE THINGS
YOU NEED MOST.

19:10.524 --> 19:15.564
BUT IT'S BEYOND MY POVVER
TO GIVE THEM TO YOU.

19:15.655 --> 19:19.068
NOW, LOOK,

19:19.158 --> 19:22.992
LOOK DEEP AND TELL ME

19:54.777 --> 19:56.609

20:16.716 --> 20:18.753

20:21.137 --> 20:23.549
THESE SHOES

20:23.639 --> 20:25.630
