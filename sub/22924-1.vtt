01:28.788 --> 01:31.018
Don't anybody move.

01:31.291 --> 01:32.986
Back.

03:17.931 --> 03:19.694
I'm gonna have to call you.

03:19.866 --> 03:22.061
Looks okay.

03:24.871 --> 03:29.001
My two pairs aren't good enough.
It's all yours.

03:34.948 --> 03:39.647
Now I'm gonna try to get my money
back with a little five card draw.

03:42.522 --> 03:44.888
What'll it be?

03:45.058 --> 03:49.552
-Two bottles of whiskey.
-You must be staying for a while.

03:49.729 --> 03:53.324
Well, long enough for him
to buy the second round.

03:54.200 --> 03:57.897
-That'll be $ 10.
-Cowboy...

03:58.371 --> 04:00.305
...you looking for something?

04:00.607 --> 04:02.575
Oh, shut up, Liz.

04:02.742 --> 04:05.040
Hey, I never did see what happened.

04:05.211 --> 04:07.839
How did the driver
get his head blown off?

04:08.014 --> 04:11.814
-Pure accident.
-They'll blame it on us.

04:13.753 --> 04:16.586
I just hate to see a man
get it like that.

04:16.755 --> 04:20.021
-No reason. No reason at all.
-Let's have another deck over here.

04:20.192 --> 04:22.525
Yeah, might change my luck.

04:23.329 --> 04:25.695
Ain't gonna help much.

04:25.865 --> 04:28.959
Get another bottle of whiskey
over at that table.

04:29.269 --> 04:32.363
Looks like a big game.

04:32.538 --> 04:34.665
Big game.

04:36.209 --> 04:39.042
I think I'll go over and take a look.

04:39.212 --> 04:41.146
You never just look
and you never win.

04:41.314 --> 04:44.112
You're the worst poker player
I ever saw, Mallory.

04:44.284 --> 04:47.219
Well, not tonight, because tonight
I feel lucky. You'll see.

04:47.854 --> 04:49.287
-Mind if I sit in?
-Sit down.

04:49.455 --> 04:51.480
Yeah, sit down, stranger.

04:52.725 --> 04:57.128
-May be just the man we're looking for.
-Come on, I feel real lucky tonight.

05:04.404 --> 05:07.965
Sledge, you made it.

05:08.141 --> 05:10.735
-Ria.
-Sledge.

05:28.695 --> 05:31.493
I been waiting here so long.

05:31.664 --> 05:33.689
I thought--

05:35.868 --> 05:38.894
I thought you'd never show up.

07:51.404 --> 07:53.463
Will three sixes do it?

07:54.073 --> 07:57.042
Not unless you can pair them up
with a couple of ladies.

07:57.210 --> 08:00.236
You gave me the jack I needed.
That makes three.

08:13.693 --> 08:15.854
Well, that lets me out.

08:19.265 --> 08:21.290
I'm out.

08:21.467 --> 08:25.096
Elizabeth, how about you
and me going upstairs.

08:25.404 --> 08:28.532
I just made a killing.

08:31.110 --> 08:34.307
It came from downstairs.

08:43.356 --> 08:45.517
Don't go down.

08:47.059 --> 08:48.993
Sledge.

08:51.998 --> 08:53.625
Hold it.

08:54.767 --> 08:59.295
Now, you leave that gun in its holster
and come down here slow and easy.

09:03.376 --> 09:06.937
Looks like the only way
he's gonna make it is to fall down.

09:19.025 --> 09:21.323
Your friend had some bad luck.

09:21.494 --> 09:25.828
Unless you want to join him,
you'll ride out of here right now.

09:27.733 --> 09:29.997
You heard him, get.

09:37.209 --> 09:40.576
Well, look at that.
Lover-boy ain't finished yet.

09:59.932 --> 10:02.332
I seen it, mister...

10:03.069 --> 10:06.505
...murder and self-defense.

12:00.619 --> 12:02.348
Hey!

12:04.557 --> 12:06.047
What--?

12:06.726 --> 12:07.750
-No.
-Get inside.

12:07.927 --> 12:09.588
Wait.

12:20.773 --> 12:24.106
-Why are you following me?
-I wasn't. I swear I wasn't.

12:26.378 --> 12:27.845
You know who I am, don't you?

12:28.314 --> 12:30.908
There's only one name
comes to my mind...

12:31.250 --> 12:34.447
...after what I saw
there at the 3 W's...

12:34.620 --> 12:37.214
...and that's Luther Sledge.

12:37.389 --> 12:39.414
And you say you wasn't following me?

12:39.725 --> 12:42.785
I've done a lot of things
in my time, mister...

12:42.962 --> 12:46.022
...but getting the price
on a man's head ain't one of them.

12:46.198 --> 12:48.860
Well, we'll just make sure of that.

12:49.034 --> 12:51.559
What are you gonna do?
What are you gonna do?

12:51.737 --> 12:55.571
Old man, you stink right now...

12:55.741 --> 12:59.006
...so I'm gonna see to it
that you don't turn me in.

12:59.178 --> 13:02.511
I'm gonna hang you up
and age you some more.

13:02.681 --> 13:05.707
You gotta believe me,
it's the gold I've been following...

13:05.885 --> 13:08.445
...about $300,000 worth.

13:08.621 --> 13:11.215
In that prison there
is where they keep it overnight.

13:11.590 --> 13:14.024
Open the gates!

13:29.008 --> 13:32.307
Open her up. Open her up.

13:39.251 --> 13:42.812
-What's that about?
-It's the gold. They're here, I told you.

13:42.988 --> 13:45.957
Now cut me down.
Come on, I gotta see it!

13:46.125 --> 13:50.789
They're here. I gotta see it. l--

14:01.941 --> 14:04.273
I missed it.

14:04.844 --> 14:07.335
I missed it.

14:09.315 --> 14:12.478
How much gold did you say
they carry in that wagon?

14:12.651 --> 14:16.587
Enough for a man to die on,
more than that, maybe.

14:21.393 --> 14:24.419
Old man, how long has it been
since you've had a hot meal...

14:24.597 --> 14:27.031
...some whiskey and a woman?

14:27.700 --> 14:30.100
All in one night?

14:31.203 --> 14:33.467
Not for a long time.

14:33.639 --> 14:37.439
Well, if your heart'll stand it,
you're coming with me.

14:50.589 --> 14:53.183
Come on, girls, sing out.

15:01.901 --> 15:06.600
-Get me out of here!
-Here, I'll give you a hand, Jade.

15:09.642 --> 15:11.507
Can't even stand
on your own two feet.

15:11.677 --> 15:13.872
Give me a hand, Millie.

15:14.947 --> 15:18.178
Wait'll I get my hands
on whoever did that.

15:22.221 --> 15:26.590
Sledge, Sledge, Sledge,
you're just in time to see...

15:26.759 --> 15:28.954
...what these animals
have done to my house.

15:29.128 --> 15:31.460
I can't take it anymore.
I just can't take it.

15:31.630 --> 15:34.997
Oh, calm down now, Jade, honey.
What'd they do?

15:35.167 --> 15:39.831
They made a hole in my floor
and my organ fell through.

15:40.539 --> 15:42.769
-Your organ fell through?
-That's right.

15:42.942 --> 15:47.038
Like animals. They burrow under
my house trying to steal my liquor.

15:47.212 --> 15:49.305
You're gonna have to do something.

15:49.481 --> 15:52.279
Don't you worry about it, Jade,
I'll take care of it.

15:52.451 --> 15:55.249
Well, you're gonna
have to do something about it.

15:55.421 --> 15:59.323
-Look. Look at that.
-Now, you just leave it to me.

15:59.625 --> 16:02.560
Sledge, you see?

16:02.728 --> 16:06.528
Well, you're right.
Your organ fell through.

16:06.699 --> 16:09.998
All right, come on,
get that thing out of there.

16:14.873 --> 16:16.807
Where's Mallory?

16:17.509 --> 16:20.000
-Got killed in a card game.
-Was two of them...

16:20.179 --> 16:22.579
...but Sledge killed them back,
both of them.

16:22.748 --> 16:24.272
Who's he?

16:24.450 --> 16:27.180
Don't know much about him,
but he may be able to help.

16:27.353 --> 16:31.551
I'll let you know. Give me a bottle
of whiskey and two glasses...

16:31.724 --> 16:35.182
...and get him whatever
kind of soup you got back there.

16:36.362 --> 16:38.455
Come on, old man.

16:40.599 --> 16:43.090
Come on, sit over there.

16:49.575 --> 16:52.009
Tell me about the gold.

16:52.177 --> 16:54.907
Well, I'm the one
that can tell you about it.

16:56.982 --> 17:00.179
They put it next to me in that prison,
those men guarding it.

17:00.352 --> 17:05.050
Not more than six inches away.
Cell right next to me.

17:05.223 --> 17:08.057
Where does that gold start from?

17:08.227 --> 17:11.890
<i>Comes from a group of mines
up there in Big Rock Canyon.</i>

17:12.064 --> 17:16.467
<i>They take a lot of gold
out of there. A lot of gold.</i>

17:17.869 --> 17:20.361
<i>They've got themselves
40 U.S. Army men...</i>

17:20.539 --> 17:24.099
<i>...just to make sure that gold
gets to the clearing-house.</i>

17:24.276 --> 17:27.244
<i>Forty soldiers, armed to the teeth.</i>

17:27.413 --> 17:30.075
<i>They're all handpicked.</i>

17:30.549 --> 17:33.109
<i>Those fellas guarding that gold...</i>

17:39.892 --> 17:44.886
<i>...they don't like to travel at night.
It's too tempting for people like you.</i>

17:46.632 --> 17:48.725
<i>At night they stop
in that prison you saw.</i>

17:48.901 --> 17:52.735
<i>And that ain't just a prison,
it's a fortress.</i>

17:52.905 --> 17:56.397
<i>It's the only place
where that damn gold is safe.</i>

17:56.575 --> 18:01.945
<i>They got a real special cell for it,
with a big old safe built into it.</i>

18:02.114 --> 18:04.878
<i>Nobody's ever tried taking it.</i>

18:05.050 --> 18:07.484
<i>It's been 10 years now.</i>

18:07.653 --> 18:10.952
<i>Them gold riders know their business.</i>

18:11.423 --> 18:14.654
<i>You gotta be loco
if you think you can take it.</i>

18:14.827 --> 18:19.196
What makes you think that shipment
they brought in was worth 300,000?

18:19.598 --> 18:22.658
Well, nothing makes me think. I know.

18:23.669 --> 18:27.537
I never could sleep
when that gold was next to me.

18:30.742 --> 18:33.905
You know, gold gives off a scent.

18:36.014 --> 18:38.414
It's like an animal or a man.

18:38.584 --> 18:40.449
Paper money...

18:41.220 --> 18:43.745
...don't throw off a scent.

18:44.790 --> 18:48.624
Paper money don't whisper to you...

18:48.794 --> 18:51.991
...like gold does
through six inches of steel.

18:52.564 --> 18:54.395
Did you follow
that gold all the way?

18:54.566 --> 18:56.625
From the mines to the clearing-house?

18:56.802 --> 18:58.167
Yeah.

18:58.637 --> 19:01.970
Hey, I reckon
you're gonna try and take it.

19:02.141 --> 19:06.305
Who knows? Maybe you'll get a little
closer to that gold than just six inches.

19:13.118 --> 19:15.416
-We're onto something.
-Yeah?

19:15.587 --> 19:17.077
Make sure everybody's ready
to move out.

19:17.256 --> 19:19.121
Right.

19:23.962 --> 19:26.430
So you're gonna try and take it.

19:26.598 --> 19:31.058
Well, you're mighty stubborn,
because you can't, you just can't.

19:40.345 --> 19:42.836
Ward, Hooker.

19:45.951 --> 19:49.045
-We're gonna split up here.
-Going into Rockville?

19:49.221 --> 19:53.419
-No way out of it, we need supplies.
-It's a hard town. They know your face.

19:53.592 --> 19:56.891
They won't see it
unless there's trouble.

19:58.163 --> 20:01.064
-Hey, old man.
-Yeah?

20:04.002 --> 20:07.403
-They know your face in Rockville?
-In prison, about 20 years' worth.

20:07.573 --> 20:08.767
But not in the town.

20:09.141 --> 20:13.168
Dorothy, Millie, stay on the buckboard.
Old man, Toby, Hooker...

20:13.345 --> 20:16.007
...we're going into Rockville
to do some buying.

20:16.181 --> 20:19.173
The rest of you follow Ward
up to the old Coaltrain Mine.

20:19.351 --> 20:21.581
Beetle, you know where
the 3 W's is?

20:21.753 --> 20:24.950
-Where you was with Mallory.
-There's a girl there named Ria.

20:25.123 --> 20:28.718
You tell her I want her. Let's go.

20:29.595 --> 20:31.529
Giddyup, there.

21:08.166 --> 21:12.102
-Yeah, you gonna be finished soon?
-It's your turn next, okay?

21:32.624 --> 21:34.751
What can I do for you, sir?

21:34.926 --> 21:38.157
Well, Mother, I guess
we'll be gone for a long time.

21:38.330 --> 21:41.959
Let me see, let me have
10 boxes of .45 Colt cartridges...

21:42.134 --> 21:45.467
...and two boxes
of shotgun shells to go with it.

21:45.671 --> 21:47.798
-And a case of Winchesters.
-A long time?

21:48.473 --> 21:50.566
With all that ammo,
you could be gone forever.

21:50.976 --> 21:54.673
Well, should we die before
our journey's through, happy days.

21:54.846 --> 21:58.145
-All is well.
-Amen.

22:02.888 --> 22:06.415
-Put that on the buckboard, please.
-Right.

22:08.360 --> 22:10.453
-Let me on one more time.
-No.

22:29.715 --> 22:33.242
-Business pretty good today, Simms?
-I'd say so now.

22:33.418 --> 22:35.750
I feel like one of them
Eastern war profiteers.

22:35.921 --> 22:39.687
-Oh, yeah, who's warring?
-Some old man in there.

22:39.858 --> 22:43.624
Bought himself enough firepower
to save Custer.

22:54.773 --> 22:56.832
Dolgh, come here.

23:20.732 --> 23:24.691
Excuse me.
I'm the sheriff here in Rockville.

23:24.870 --> 23:27.532
Sorry to bother,
but I'd like to ask a few questions.

23:27.706 --> 23:29.401
Well, go right ahead, sheriff.

23:29.608 --> 23:32.577
You been buying a lot of ammunition.
Could I ask you why?

23:32.744 --> 23:36.043
Well, we got a family, sheriff,
big family going west...

23:36.214 --> 23:37.977
...and them lndians had a dry year.

23:38.150 --> 23:40.209
I don't wanna get caught short
with them being hungry.

23:40.385 --> 23:44.253
-Ever been in Rockville before?
-No, sirree, sheriff.

23:44.423 --> 23:46.118
Seems to me I've seen you before.

23:46.291 --> 23:48.759
Would you mind
stepping outside for a moment?

23:48.927 --> 23:52.693
If you can stand the sight of this
old-timer's face in the light of day...

23:52.864 --> 23:55.992
...I'll gladly accommodate you.

23:58.136 --> 24:01.128
You make one sound
and you'll be all over the ceiling.

24:01.306 --> 24:04.673
And you, put your hands on the
counter and keep your mouth shut.

24:07.379 --> 24:09.279
Old man.

24:11.283 --> 24:13.945
His deputy is nosing around
that other store.

24:14.119 --> 24:17.088
You go over and tell him
the sheriff wants to talk to him.

24:17.255 --> 24:22.192
And the rest of you
get out of town, nice and easy.

24:22.360 --> 24:25.352
You'll never make it
out the door, Sledge.

24:26.364 --> 24:28.559
Yeah, you know me.

24:28.733 --> 24:31.827
The name, the face
and the price, huh?

24:32.003 --> 24:33.834
If I don't get out, you don't.

24:34.005 --> 24:36.667
You ain't gonna get a chance
to sit around a stove...

24:36.842 --> 24:38.707
...remembering your one day of glory.

24:39.077 --> 24:43.377
That deputy of yours don't get
over here, your twilight years are over.

24:53.658 --> 24:55.592
Easy, now.

25:01.233 --> 25:04.532
-Boss, you want me?
-Yeah, Dolgh. Come on in.

25:04.703 --> 25:06.398
It's Sledge, look out!

25:11.009 --> 25:12.670
Get him. Get him.

25:18.917 --> 25:22.148
Try anything else
and you'll have a closed coffin.

25:25.323 --> 25:28.053
Cindy! Cindy!

25:29.594 --> 25:31.994
Mommy!

25:36.601 --> 25:40.435
We gotta get the hell out of here.
They're setting up a crossfire.

25:52.484 --> 25:54.748
Toby's trying to make it back in.

26:08.833 --> 26:10.824
Oh, how many times
they wanna kill him?

26:11.169 --> 26:15.333
Tell those crazy bastards
he's already dead.

26:15.507 --> 26:16.997
This is Ripley.

26:17.676 --> 26:19.303
Hold your fire.

26:21.880 --> 26:24.314
Hold your fire!

26:27.419 --> 26:31.913
You tell them we're walking out.
All of us.

26:33.692 --> 26:36.456
You two-bit Wyatt Earp, tell them.

26:36.628 --> 26:41.031
Don't believe all that crap about
your tin star. You bleed just like we do.

26:41.933 --> 26:44.026
We're coming out.

26:44.202 --> 26:46.432
We got your sheriff.

26:46.605 --> 26:49.540
Now, stay out of the streets.

26:50.408 --> 26:53.775
Anybody sights a rifle,
fires a shot...

26:54.245 --> 26:56.873
...you got yourselves a dead sheriff.

26:57.215 --> 27:01.948
Hooker, see if you can coax
Goldie May over here.

27:02.120 --> 27:03.815
Goldie May, here.

27:06.191 --> 27:07.715
Come on, Goldie May.

27:08.660 --> 27:10.525
Come on, baby, come on.

27:11.062 --> 27:13.428
Come on, baby.

27:13.965 --> 27:15.660
Come on, baby. Come on.

27:16.101 --> 27:17.796
Come on, now. Come on.

27:18.269 --> 27:20.260
Come on, come on, come on.

27:20.438 --> 27:22.531
Easy, there. Come on, baby.

27:22.707 --> 27:25.005
Easy. Come on.

28:36.414 --> 28:38.473
Now, hold it.

28:39.217 --> 28:41.082
Hooker.

28:41.786 --> 28:45.813
Put him up on Goldie May with Toby.
Tie him good around him.

28:45.990 --> 28:47.423
Where are you taking me?

28:47.592 --> 28:50.823
I'm gonna let them Apaches
you use for trackers find you.

28:54.599 --> 28:57.932
Ride him, Toby.
Ride him straight to hell!

30:03.902 --> 30:07.065
We've been outnumbered before...

30:09.574 --> 30:12.372
...and for a hell of a lot less money.

30:12.544 --> 30:17.174
Must be some reason
nobody ever tried to take it.

30:22.654 --> 30:27.353
What's the longest distance
you ever followed them?

30:27.525 --> 30:29.618
After they leave prison,
about five miles.

30:29.794 --> 30:31.989
Well, that ain't very far.

30:32.163 --> 30:35.360
We're gonna follow that gold
every step of the way.

30:35.533 --> 30:38.730
Somewhere there's gotta be a place
where we can take it.

30:38.903 --> 30:40.564
That's what we're gonna look for.

30:40.738 --> 30:43.730
I don't like the idea
of those guards being professionals.

30:43.908 --> 30:46.399
Forget it.

30:46.578 --> 30:50.241
They haven't used
those guns in 10 years.

30:50.949 --> 30:53.747
They ain't professionals.

30:54.319 --> 30:55.343
We are.

31:01.226 --> 31:05.890
Stay here. I'm going down
to see how close I can get.

31:49.274 --> 31:51.265
Rider coming.

31:51.809 --> 31:53.333
Rider coming!

33:24.435 --> 33:28.667
Seen a lot of formations in my time,
but never one like that cross.

33:28.840 --> 33:31.968
The hell with it.
You couldn't take it with a pope.

33:39.117 --> 33:40.880
Relax.

33:41.386 --> 33:44.787
Don't you even know the sound
of Beetle slopping in the saddle?

33:44.956 --> 33:47.948
It's Beetle, all right.
He's taking Ria up to your place.

33:48.126 --> 33:49.718
What are we gonna do, Sledge?

33:50.661 --> 33:55.564
You're gonna sit and wait
till I tell you what to do.

33:55.733 --> 33:58.566
There's a way.
There's gotta be a way.

33:58.736 --> 34:00.761
I'm getting itchy
staying around here.

34:00.938 --> 34:04.931
That sheriff's gonna come smelling
us out and he won't take us alive.

34:05.109 --> 34:07.441
We should've killed him
when we had the chance.

34:07.612 --> 34:08.873
-Hooker?
-Yeah?

34:09.447 --> 34:12.074
You and the boys go outside.
I wanna talk to Sledge.

34:12.250 --> 34:16.482
That suits me just fine, especially
if you can find out what's going on.

34:30.400 --> 34:33.335
We gotta move on to something else.

34:34.739 --> 34:36.797
Got nothing in my pocket but a hole.

34:37.074 --> 34:38.838
I want that gold!

34:39.010 --> 34:42.639
Maybe $300,000!
300,000, Ward!

34:45.882 --> 34:49.683
I ain't kidding myself it's the last one.

34:49.853 --> 34:53.380
I'm gonna finish my life
with a white picket fence...

34:53.558 --> 34:56.356
...and the little woman
making biscuits.

34:56.527 --> 35:00.623
Me sprouting gray
like a tree in the fall.

35:00.798 --> 35:03.494
I'm gonna get it
with a bullet in my head.

35:03.668 --> 35:07.604
Or a rope around my neck. I want
a little taste of living before I go.

35:07.772 --> 35:11.299
You try to take that gold,
you're committing suicide.

35:11.476 --> 35:13.444
You thinking of riding, Ward?

35:14.512 --> 35:15.774
Yeah, in the morning.

35:22.086 --> 35:24.714
Had a lot of good times together.

35:25.056 --> 35:26.421
Yeah.

35:27.024 --> 35:28.286
What about the others?

35:30.328 --> 35:33.092
They'll stay with you if you want them.

35:40.271 --> 35:43.832
I'd damn sure watch them,
they're getting hungry.

35:59.123 --> 36:00.784
Ria?

36:03.394 --> 36:06.295
-Ria?
-I'm up here.

36:08.766 --> 36:10.791
You been crying?

36:15.940 --> 36:20.240
I don't even remember
the last time a woman cried over me.

36:22.647 --> 36:25.844
Most times I don't even remember
their faces in the morning.

36:26.584 --> 36:30.611
Nobody meant much to me before.
Before you.

36:31.088 --> 36:33.613
But you want that gold
more than you want me.

36:33.791 --> 36:36.555
That's why I've been crying, Sledge.

36:37.428 --> 36:40.659
You know, you were the first.

36:42.700 --> 36:44.895
The first time I felt anything.

36:45.069 --> 36:49.301
Used to think there was something
wrong with me until you came along.

36:55.379 --> 36:59.713
I'm your woman, Sledge,
no matter what happens.

36:59.884 --> 37:02.352
I'll always be yours.

37:10.828 --> 37:12.819
I love you.

37:29.513 --> 37:31.708
Keep it going, there.

37:31.882 --> 37:33.713
Come on now, old man.

37:33.884 --> 37:36.478
You watch it, old fool.

37:40.258 --> 37:42.419
Get him, old man!

37:42.927 --> 37:44.588
I feel like dancing!

37:55.139 --> 37:56.504
What's all the commotion?

37:56.674 --> 37:59.040
It's the old man.
He was inside with Dorothy.

37:59.210 --> 38:02.043
You boys should have seen me
in my prime.

38:02.513 --> 38:05.209
They don't make them
like me anymore.

38:05.383 --> 38:09.046
Why, there was a time I could
have taken you all on, all of you!

38:09.220 --> 38:13.486
-Just when the hell was that, old man?
-Before they locked me in that prison.

38:13.658 --> 38:16.991
There wasn't a man that could lock
horns with me in this territory.

38:17.161 --> 38:18.890
You're a liar.

38:19.063 --> 38:22.794
You was as good as you say you were,
you'd be six feet under.

38:25.202 --> 38:29.468
You're feeling mean, because
you know that gold can't be taken...

38:29.640 --> 38:32.302
...and you've seen it yourself.
And I tell you...

38:32.476 --> 38:36.572
...if you try to take it you're gonna
wind up dead or in prison...

38:36.747 --> 38:41.184
...and that's the closest you'll ever
get to it, through six inches of steel.

38:41.352 --> 38:45.652
I know. I've been
closer to that gold inside...

38:45.823 --> 38:47.484
...than any man on the outside...

38:47.658 --> 38:50.957
...and I tell you,
it can't be taken.

38:51.696 --> 38:53.527
Oh, yes, it can!

38:57.168 --> 38:59.830
I knew it! I knew it all the time.

39:00.004 --> 39:03.167
We're gonna take that gold,
and we're gonna take all of it.

39:03.341 --> 39:07.175
And you and your tales of old-timers
don't mean a whiff of cow dung...

39:07.345 --> 39:09.575
...because you never had
the guts to do it.

39:09.747 --> 39:12.409
-We're gonna take it from the inside.
-The inside?

39:12.583 --> 39:13.982
Right.

39:14.151 --> 39:17.314
Now, tell me the layout.
And you better have a good memory...

39:17.488 --> 39:19.854
...or I'm gonna bust you
like I did that bottle.

39:20.024 --> 39:22.652
Well, I told you.
They put the gold in a vault.

39:22.827 --> 39:26.354
Used to be like all the other cells,
but they lined it with steel...

39:26.530 --> 39:28.964
...and it's in the hole,
in maximum security.

39:29.133 --> 39:31.931
And you say they open and close it
with a combination?

39:32.103 --> 39:34.731
Right. And the only one
that knows it is the warden.

39:35.439 --> 39:37.737
How many men
they got in that prison?

39:37.908 --> 39:40.308
I don't know, about 500,
give or take a few.

39:40.478 --> 39:43.572
Now, you think real hard
before you answer this.

39:43.881 --> 39:46.315
If they was to take me prisoner...

39:47.818 --> 39:50.343
...where do you figure they'd put me?

39:50.521 --> 39:54.582
With the price on your head,
I figure it would be maximum security.

39:54.759 --> 39:57.284
They put you in there,
you ain't ever gonna get out.

39:57.461 --> 40:00.328
Oh, I might. I just might...

40:00.498 --> 40:01.988
...if you was to take me in.

40:04.068 --> 40:06.298
<i>If I took you?
What's the matter, you loco?</i>

40:06.470 --> 40:10.372
-Oh, you two can't take it alone.
-We ain't alone!

40:10.541 --> 40:13.408
We outnumber them.
You heard what the old man said.

40:13.577 --> 40:16.068
They got 500 prisoners in there.

40:16.313 --> 40:19.009
Well, we're gonna bust them out.

40:19.183 --> 40:24.086
And all those guards
and the fancy gold riders...

40:24.255 --> 40:27.190
...they ain't gonna know what hit them.

40:27.358 --> 40:29.588
They're gonna be chasing prisoners...

40:29.760 --> 40:32.228
-...all over the territory.
-Sledge.

40:32.396 --> 40:34.159
They're stacked against us.

40:35.633 --> 40:38.101
Now, we're going in there...

40:38.636 --> 40:41.127
...and we're coming out
with that gold...

40:41.305 --> 40:43.102
...or we ain't ever coming out.

40:48.579 --> 40:50.103
Now, what do you say?

40:55.419 --> 40:57.478
-I'm in.
-Right.

40:58.689 --> 41:01.852
Hey, old man. Now, you go in there
and you get some paper...

41:02.026 --> 41:05.621
...and you're gonna draw a diagram
of that prison and I'll look at it.

41:05.796 --> 41:09.892
And if it ain't exact,
somebody's gonna put a bullet...

41:10.067 --> 41:12.501
...right through your head.
Now, get!

41:12.837 --> 41:14.964
Beetle, saddle up again.

41:15.139 --> 41:18.905
You're going after a few things
we need. And from now on...

41:19.577 --> 41:21.772
...no more whiskey.

41:25.182 --> 41:27.241
Ria?

41:32.823 --> 41:34.757
We'll be moving out in the morning.

41:34.925 --> 41:37.519
Things work out, we'll be
across the border in Siego.

41:37.695 --> 41:39.492
-You know where that is?
-Yes.

41:39.663 --> 41:41.790
Well, good. You wait for me there.

41:41.966 --> 41:44.526
And what if things don't work out?

41:50.341 --> 41:52.775
Then I won't be there.

41:58.849 --> 42:01.113
-Hooker?
-Yeah?

42:01.285 --> 42:02.718
You got everything?

42:03.921 --> 42:05.548
Yeah.

42:07.057 --> 42:10.458
All right, see you inside.

42:56.774 --> 42:59.504
-What is it you want?
-I wanna see the warden.

42:59.677 --> 43:04.080
-What's your business?
-I'm a U.S. marshal. Got a prisoner.

43:04.248 --> 43:06.148
Can't be one of ours.

43:06.317 --> 43:08.615
Take him to town, sheriff's office.

43:08.786 --> 43:11.414
You tell him I got Luther Sledge!

43:15.793 --> 43:19.388
Call the warden. Tell him they got
Luther Sledge out here.

43:19.563 --> 43:23.260
-Seems as though they heard of you.
-Tell the sheriff!

43:44.722 --> 43:46.314
Follow me.

43:58.035 --> 43:59.935
Careful!

44:00.404 --> 44:02.565
Now, hold him there.

44:25.562 --> 44:27.325
It's up this way.

44:34.571 --> 44:37.506
-You send for the sheriff?
-Sure did.

44:37.808 --> 44:39.571
Bring him in.

44:55.459 --> 44:58.326
Come over here, Luther Sledge.

45:01.065 --> 45:04.296
-Where did you get him?
-Oh, I picked him up...

45:04.468 --> 45:09.064
...about halfway between here and
3 W's. Started tracking him there.

45:09.239 --> 45:11.764
What did you bring him here for?

45:11.942 --> 45:15.400
I don't like traveling
a prisoner like him all night.

45:15.579 --> 45:18.980
Getting tired, thought maybe
you might lock us up till morning.

45:19.149 --> 45:22.880
Sheriff Ripley might have something
to say about that.

45:23.220 --> 45:26.280
Sledge here killed one of his deputies.

45:27.858 --> 45:30.258
How much money
you worth now, Sledge?

45:31.562 --> 45:33.826
Why don't you ask him.

45:34.732 --> 45:37.326
He's the one that's gonna collect it.

45:38.368 --> 45:41.565
Last time I saw it was 5000,
warm or cold.

45:42.206 --> 45:43.730
Five thousand.

45:44.041 --> 45:46.168
What did you say your name was?

45:46.343 --> 45:48.470
Well, I don't think I did.

45:48.779 --> 45:50.747
It's Ward...

45:50.914 --> 45:52.905
...Marshal lrwin Ward.

45:58.422 --> 46:00.413
You ready to lock us up, warden?

46:00.724 --> 46:05.525
I don't know. Seems to me the sheriff
might have that jurisdiction.

46:08.398 --> 46:09.922
What are you talking about?

46:10.768 --> 46:13.601
I never kept
overnight prisoners before.

46:13.771 --> 46:17.764
I only get them
after the court's through with them.

46:20.811 --> 46:23.507
I was hoping I'd run into you again.

46:23.680 --> 46:25.375
I'd like to even things up.

46:30.521 --> 46:32.716
What are you doing?
He's in my custody.

46:32.890 --> 46:36.223
-I don't want nothing to happen to him.
-I don't care whose custody.

46:36.393 --> 46:39.726
-He killed my deputy. He's gonna pay.
-Not by you, he ain't.

46:39.897 --> 46:42.661
No one's trying to cheat you
out of the reward money.

46:42.833 --> 46:46.234
I ain't gonna argue. He's in my
custody and he's gonna stay there.

46:46.403 --> 46:49.338
If you wanna be locked up with him...

46:49.506 --> 46:53.203
...there's no reason the sheriff
can't do it for you in Rockville.

46:54.378 --> 46:56.403
Not only that, marshal...

46:56.580 --> 46:59.242
...I'll get a posse to ride with you
to the county seat.

46:59.550 --> 47:03.987
-Even go with you myself.
-That sounds like a fair thing to do.

47:04.154 --> 47:07.590
Sheriff, you lay off him tonight.

47:07.758 --> 47:10.693
That's all the marshal here
is worried about.

47:16.700 --> 47:19.328
You're staying with me tonight.

47:20.103 --> 47:22.833
Well, that's just fine.

47:25.776 --> 47:28.574
I hear you're good in bed.

47:29.346 --> 47:30.813
Ripley!

47:35.219 --> 47:37.244
I'll keep him here, Ripley.

47:37.421 --> 47:40.049
Be here in the morning
with your posse.

47:41.625 --> 47:43.183
That's soon enough.

47:43.360 --> 47:45.692
I'll be back at dawn.

47:52.035 --> 47:53.764
Leave your weapons here.

48:05.582 --> 48:07.447
Better leave the key to his chains.

48:08.952 --> 48:11.648
Red, take them to maximum security.

48:11.822 --> 48:13.619
Yes, sir.

49:59.863 --> 50:02.457
How come you
staying with us, marshal?

50:02.632 --> 50:04.566
Don't you trust us?

50:04.735 --> 50:06.293
No.

50:13.143 --> 50:15.634
By tomorrow morning
you'll wish you had.

50:15.812 --> 50:19.213
-I've been in prisons before.
-Not like this one, you ain't.

50:19.383 --> 50:22.045
No, sir. You ain't gonna like it.

50:22.919 --> 50:24.853
I'll worry about that.

50:25.022 --> 50:27.957
Wait and see what we have
in our maximum.

51:01.024 --> 51:04.118
Hey, Sledge, you come
to rob the gold?

51:06.263 --> 51:08.959
Do not sleep there, Sledge.

51:33.423 --> 51:36.688
Didn't count on him roughing you up.
You gonna be all right?

51:36.860 --> 51:38.828
-Yeah, yeah.
-You sure?

51:38.995 --> 51:42.761
He got in a couple of pretty good
whacks on me.

51:43.700 --> 51:45.429
We're in, Ward.

51:45.602 --> 51:48.230
We are in.

51:54.511 --> 51:56.411
There it is...

51:56.580 --> 51:59.344
...just like the old
man said it would be.

51:59.516 --> 52:01.450
Talk about safes.

52:01.618 --> 52:03.677
That's the granddaddy of them all.

52:04.154 --> 52:05.951
Yeah.

52:07.157 --> 52:09.751
It's gonna start getting light soon.

52:10.660 --> 52:12.457
We'd better get started.

52:18.602 --> 52:21.571
Careful, that sheriff kicks like a mule.

52:39.322 --> 52:43.520
Going crazy here.
I'm going crazy here!

52:43.693 --> 52:47.629
-Call the guard!
-Shut up, you crazy bastard!

52:48.064 --> 52:50.658
If they don't shut up,
they'll bring the guards in.

52:50.834 --> 52:52.324
All right, get with it, Ward.

53:01.444 --> 53:03.935
Easy. Don't break it.

53:06.183 --> 53:08.014
It's stuck.

53:08.185 --> 53:10.016
Hey, marshal.

53:10.187 --> 53:14.089
When you finish holding his hand,
come on over to hold mine.

53:14.257 --> 53:15.849
Wiseass.

53:16.026 --> 53:18.995
If we get out of here,
I'm gonna put a bullet in him.

53:20.564 --> 53:23.692
Shut up, damn it! Shut up!

53:27.537 --> 53:30.768
Guard! Guard!

53:30.941 --> 53:33.705
Come on, Ward, get it.

53:33.944 --> 53:35.935
Try the right cuff.

53:37.881 --> 53:40.475
-Shut up!
-Shut up!

53:40.717 --> 53:43.049
Shut the hell up, all of you!

53:51.161 --> 53:53.994
Well, well, well.

53:54.164 --> 53:56.826
Can't figure you out.

53:57.801 --> 54:00.668
Ain't nobody being hanged out there.

54:02.639 --> 54:05.472
Ain't even a full moon tonight.

54:10.113 --> 54:12.411
Now, if that don't shut you up...

54:12.582 --> 54:15.415
...I'll be forced to lay one
on your head.

54:15.852 --> 54:17.843
That's better.

54:18.021 --> 54:20.285
How's he doing, marshal?

54:20.457 --> 54:22.516
Is he behaving himself?

54:22.692 --> 54:26.128
Well, I think when you
busted his hand...

54:26.296 --> 54:29.060
...you busted his bladder.

54:30.600 --> 54:34.400
Well, come morning,
when the sheriff takes custody...

54:34.571 --> 54:37.039
...you better get
a storeful of slop buckets...

54:37.207 --> 54:40.142
...because he's really gonna need it.

54:41.611 --> 54:45.707
Because Ripley's
gonna be your judge...

54:45.882 --> 54:50.148
...jury and executioner.

54:51.788 --> 54:53.050
Hey, they got Red.

54:53.423 --> 54:55.414
He got Red. He got Red.

54:55.725 --> 54:58.125
Hey, hey, Sledge, get us out of here!

54:58.295 --> 55:01.890
-Get us all out of here.
-Hurry up with those keys.

55:02.065 --> 55:03.862
Come on.

55:04.501 --> 55:06.093
What's the matter?

55:08.171 --> 55:11.004
-Damn. They don't fit, Sledge.
-Sledge!

55:11.207 --> 55:13.732
-He don't have the cell keys.
-Who's got them?

55:13.910 --> 55:15.707
Mac. He's in the tunnel.

55:20.717 --> 55:22.708
-Mac's coming.
-Forget it, Ward.

55:23.053 --> 55:24.714
Get him on his feet.

55:29.793 --> 55:31.624
Turn him around.

55:39.336 --> 55:44.831
Hey, Red, how many times I gotta tell
you to keep that block door closed?

55:52.415 --> 55:55.441
Hey, Red, I'm talking to you.

56:10.533 --> 56:12.592
All right, hold it! Hold it!

56:12.769 --> 56:15.738
You try to get loose
and I'll break your neck.

56:15.905 --> 56:17.839
All right, get his keys.

56:20.343 --> 56:23.972
I can't make it, Sledge.
He's liable to break free.

56:24.147 --> 56:27.810
Pass him down from cell to cell
so I can get this gun on him.

56:40.830 --> 56:44.266
I'll kill you, you old bastard.

56:49.372 --> 56:50.896
I'll kill you.

56:51.074 --> 56:54.237
I'll kill you.

56:55.645 --> 56:58.876
I'll kill you.

57:04.287 --> 57:05.618
All right, that's enough.

57:05.989 --> 57:08.480
Now, take your keys out
and throw them over here.

57:18.835 --> 57:20.996
Damn it, the keys.

57:46.329 --> 57:49.196
I said throw them over here.

57:56.806 --> 57:58.637
Let's get the hell out of here.

57:58.808 --> 58:00.969
Let me out!

58:01.144 --> 58:02.577
Hey, open her up!

58:02.745 --> 58:05.942
I'll let these out first,
then open the other cells. Shut up!

58:06.115 --> 58:09.346
Shut up and listen! There's only
one way to get out of here.

58:09.519 --> 58:12.682
That's to take the guards
and bust every cell open.

58:12.856 --> 58:15.723
If you don't,
you can stay here and rot...

58:15.892 --> 58:19.055
...or wait till they hang you.
Now, what do you want?

58:20.230 --> 58:22.061
Start them.

58:43.786 --> 58:46.653
Open it up, I'm in for a hanging.

58:47.790 --> 58:51.590
When that black hood comes over
your face, you think of me.

58:52.195 --> 58:53.628
Get them out.

58:53.897 --> 58:55.421
What about the wolf?

58:55.598 --> 58:59.125
You might as well turn him out,
they're gonna kill him anyway.

58:59.302 --> 59:01.361
Come on, Ward!

59:03.506 --> 59:06.907
Let's open up them other cell blocks.
Come on.

59:11.514 --> 59:13.004
Let me out!

59:13.182 --> 59:15.047
Let me out!

59:15.785 --> 59:17.514
Let me out!

59:17.687 --> 59:19.245
Let me out!

01:00:05.001 --> 01:00:06.798
Get back!

01:00:07.070 --> 01:00:08.935
Come on, get back!

01:00:12.475 --> 01:00:14.602
Okay. Okay.

01:00:14.777 --> 01:00:17.143
Make sure those cell blocks
are open, Ward.

01:00:17.313 --> 01:00:19.008
Right!

01:00:19.182 --> 01:00:21.150
Take these shells.

01:00:21.951 --> 01:00:23.885
Let me get this.

01:01:57.180 --> 01:01:59.478
Don't kill him, I need him.

01:02:01.918 --> 01:02:03.647
The combination, what is it?

01:02:04.053 --> 01:02:07.318
The combination, what is it?

01:03:08.351 --> 01:03:11.115
Come on!
They're breaking out of the prison.

01:03:34.377 --> 01:03:36.777
Beetle, watch that tunnel.

01:03:41.951 --> 01:03:44.385
-Where's the warden?
-They killed him.

01:03:44.554 --> 01:03:47.785
What do we do now? Them
gold riders will be coming in here.

01:03:47.957 --> 01:03:51.222
-They must have heard the shots.
-Joyce and Guthrie will hold them.

01:03:51.394 --> 01:03:54.261
Hooker, put the old man in the cell.

01:03:55.498 --> 01:03:57.864
-Please, don't put me in there.
-Get in there.

01:03:58.034 --> 01:04:01.367
-Sledge, I can't stay in here.
-You hear me good, old man.

01:04:01.537 --> 01:04:04.301
You said you heard that combination.
You can remember.

01:04:04.473 --> 01:04:08.239
-I can't remember. Please let me out.
-You sold me on this claim...

01:04:08.411 --> 01:04:11.005
...and you'll pay off
or I'm gonna leave you in here.

01:04:14.483 --> 01:04:16.075
Bice, turn that tumbler.

01:04:20.389 --> 01:04:23.017
Shut up, old man, and listen!

01:04:57.426 --> 01:05:00.589
-That's one.
-Turn another.

01:05:13.376 --> 01:05:15.503
Come on. Come on. Slow.

01:05:15.678 --> 01:05:17.270
Come on, Bice.

01:05:23.152 --> 01:05:25.017
Another one.

01:05:25.821 --> 01:05:27.083
The next one.

01:05:28.391 --> 01:05:30.120
Right.

01:05:35.064 --> 01:05:38.864
Slow. Easy. Easy.

01:05:39.535 --> 01:05:41.002
That's it.

01:05:41.203 --> 01:05:44.138
-Turn the handle!
-Turn the handle.

01:05:55.217 --> 01:05:59.051
-They're riding in. I can hear them.
-Come on, Sledge.

01:06:01.724 --> 01:06:06.184
You're gonna have a long time
to remember, old man. Let's go!

01:06:07.363 --> 01:06:08.796
Sledge! Sledge!

01:06:09.265 --> 01:06:10.527
Sledge, wait a minute!

01:06:10.700 --> 01:06:12.600
I remember.

01:06:13.469 --> 01:06:15.300
I remember they turned it twice.

01:06:15.471 --> 01:06:16.870
Come on, Sledge, forget it.

01:06:17.039 --> 01:06:18.529
Look, now try it!

01:06:54.176 --> 01:06:56.667
-I told you.
-Sledge!

01:06:56.846 --> 01:06:58.177
We gotta get out of here.

01:06:58.414 --> 01:07:00.177
Here we go.

01:07:19.035 --> 01:07:22.334
All right, let's go. Come on.

01:08:19.627 --> 01:08:22.825
Sledge!

01:09:35.770 --> 01:09:38.261
We'll rest the horses here.

01:09:41.644 --> 01:09:44.112
Put the bags on the ground here.

01:10:10.839 --> 01:10:12.568
Divide the rest.

01:10:14.109 --> 01:10:16.543
How much you figure each of us got?

01:10:16.812 --> 01:10:18.143
I don't know.

01:10:18.314 --> 01:10:20.441
But I can remember
when we never dreamed...

01:10:20.616 --> 01:10:23.141
...of splitting this much up
among the bunch of us.

01:10:23.319 --> 01:10:27.517
Well, that ain't exactly a split, sonny.
Sledge got double.

01:10:37.199 --> 01:10:39.292
Wanna play a few hands?

01:10:39.568 --> 01:10:42.128
You trying to get some of my gold?

01:13:46.889 --> 01:13:48.481
Joyce.

01:13:52.594 --> 01:13:54.152
The man cheated me.

01:13:54.329 --> 01:13:57.594
You didn't have to kill him.
I'd have made up his gold.

01:13:57.766 --> 01:13:59.791
Stand up, you murdering
son of a bitch.

01:13:59.968 --> 01:14:01.993
Guthrie. Now, Joyce was cheating.

01:14:02.171 --> 01:14:05.971
He didn't have to die for it.
That was the old man's right.

01:14:06.608 --> 01:14:07.836
I won't side with you.

01:14:08.010 --> 01:14:10.774
You could have had my life
any time you wanted it.

01:14:10.946 --> 01:14:13.779
I would have died for you, Sledge.
I would have.

01:14:13.949 --> 01:14:15.883
He killed Joyce
and you say he's right?

01:14:16.151 --> 01:14:18.676
His life wasn't his anymore.

01:14:19.121 --> 01:14:21.555
It belonged to the man
who caught him cheating...

01:14:21.723 --> 01:14:24.453
...and if you don't know that,
you better learn it.

01:14:26.261 --> 01:14:29.958
-Come on, I'll help you bury him.
-You bury him, Sledge!

01:14:30.132 --> 01:14:32.498
That old man
that none of us ever knew...

01:14:32.668 --> 01:14:36.035
...took Joyce's life.
And he took you too.

01:14:36.205 --> 01:14:38.400
So you bury him.

01:14:45.380 --> 01:14:49.214
Hate don't belong in a card game,
but, old man...

01:14:49.485 --> 01:14:53.478
...I'm gonna take every grain of gold
you got in front of you.

01:16:04.893 --> 01:16:06.121
This game is over.

01:16:30.218 --> 01:16:31.515
You just gonna go?

01:16:31.687 --> 01:16:34.952
What about us, Sledge?
You just gonna leave us?

01:16:35.257 --> 01:16:38.192
There's a cupful of gold left up there.

01:16:38.527 --> 01:16:40.085
Split it up any way you want.

01:16:40.596 --> 01:16:42.325
Couldn't you give us some more?

01:16:42.497 --> 01:16:45.022
He ain't gonna give you
any of his gold.

01:16:45.200 --> 01:16:47.634
He'd just as soon
leave you here to die.

01:16:47.803 --> 01:16:50.328
You're dead already, old man.

01:16:50.505 --> 01:16:53.167
Your life's in those sacks
and I'm taking them.

01:16:53.342 --> 01:16:56.800
For the rest of your miserable life
you'll never forget it.

01:16:57.479 --> 01:17:01.279
So you take your share out of that cup.

01:17:13.729 --> 01:17:16.027
It ain't no share.

01:17:16.565 --> 01:17:18.533
It ain't nothing.

01:17:19.267 --> 01:17:22.759
And it ain't gonna keep us
from getting what's ours.

01:17:24.439 --> 01:17:26.771
We're going after Ria.

01:19:50.085 --> 01:19:51.643
Sledge!

01:19:51.820 --> 01:19:53.481
Sledge!

01:19:53.722 --> 01:19:55.349
We know you're here!

01:19:56.158 --> 01:19:59.389
We thought we'd set up
a little deal with you.

01:19:59.928 --> 01:20:05.264
You give us half of what you took us
for at poker and we'll call it even.

01:20:06.968 --> 01:20:08.765
What do you say?

01:21:23.578 --> 01:21:25.512
Old man!

01:21:26.181 --> 01:21:29.810
Old man! I got Kehoe!

01:21:30.151 --> 01:21:32.381
-Did you hear me?
-Kehoe.

01:21:32.554 --> 01:21:35.785
If you want that gold,
you'll have to come and get it!

01:21:35.957 --> 01:21:38.892
Hooker! Did you hear that?

01:21:39.060 --> 01:21:40.960
Kehoe, he got him.

01:21:41.129 --> 01:21:42.619
The odds are getting shorter.

01:21:42.797 --> 01:21:45.960
-And our shares are getting bigger.
-We don't know where he is.

01:21:46.134 --> 01:21:48.830
We don't have to know.
He's coming to us.

01:21:49.170 --> 01:21:51.798
You just keep that carbine ready.

01:21:52.707 --> 01:21:56.643
How long we gonna wait?
The people will be coming back soon.

01:21:56.811 --> 01:21:59.075
Well, the waiting's over.

01:22:01.082 --> 01:22:02.606
Sledge!

01:22:03.685 --> 01:22:05.812
We got Ria!

01:22:11.760 --> 01:22:13.421
And the deal's changed.

01:22:15.163 --> 01:22:18.564
All the gold
or she's gonna join Kehoe.

01:22:21.369 --> 01:22:24.805
You're bluffing. Let me hear her.

01:22:36.718 --> 01:22:39.846
-Call out to him!
-You'll kill him anyway.

01:22:40.021 --> 01:22:41.613
I'll never help you.

01:22:41.790 --> 01:22:44.054
You don't and I'll turn Bice
loose on you.

01:22:44.225 --> 01:22:46.193
Just make her call out, nothing else.

01:22:46.361 --> 01:22:48.852
Sure, Hooker, don't worry.

01:22:49.030 --> 01:22:51.931
Being in here does funny things
to some people.

01:22:52.100 --> 01:22:54.466
Come on, I haven't got all day!

01:22:56.104 --> 01:22:59.596
Sledge sure knows how to pick them.

01:23:07.115 --> 01:23:08.639
Sledge!

01:23:09.584 --> 01:23:13.816
There's a fountain in the square.
Bring all the gold there, and now.

01:23:14.923 --> 01:23:16.720
You hear me, Sledge?

01:23:16.891 --> 01:23:20.258
You wanna save her,
you bring the gold to the square.

01:23:25.033 --> 01:23:27.194
Ria! Ria!

01:23:28.003 --> 01:23:29.527
She's all right, Sledge.

01:23:30.271 --> 01:23:34.002
You just bring that gold to the fountain
and we'll turn her loose.

01:23:34.442 --> 01:23:37.377
After this, I'm not asking no more.

01:23:45.487 --> 01:23:47.045
It's coming down!

01:23:47.222 --> 01:23:50.214
We done it. We done it!

01:23:51.359 --> 01:23:53.793
Bice, once we get that gold,
I'm gonna kill you.

01:23:53.962 --> 01:23:57.830
It's coming. It's coming.
Bice, you get up there and fire at him.

01:23:57.999 --> 01:23:59.933
Hooker, let's go.

01:25:09.737 --> 01:25:13.138
Damn it, the gold. Get the horses!

01:26:10.064 --> 01:26:13.056
It's all the old man's fault.

01:26:13.234 --> 01:26:15.031
-We didn't need the gold...
-Ria.

01:26:15.203 --> 01:26:16.568
...to be happy.

01:26:30.051 --> 01:26:31.541
Bice.

01:26:34.389 --> 01:26:35.617
Bice.

01:26:48.770 --> 01:26:51.796
-He got Bice.
-Maybe the other way around.

01:26:51.973 --> 01:26:55.568
No, you'd hear Bice yelling it
at the top of his lungs if it was.

01:26:55.743 --> 01:26:57.040
We got all the gold!

01:26:57.212 --> 01:26:59.806
How do you figure we'll keep it
with Sledge alive?

01:27:00.215 --> 01:27:03.116
-We're gonna have to take him!
-All right.

01:27:03.451 --> 01:27:07.285
I'll work back up the same way.
Just be sure you come behind him.

01:27:07.455 --> 01:27:09.821
You can't travel very fast
with that gold...

01:27:10.158 --> 01:27:12.388
...so you just remember
you got a partner.

01:27:12.560 --> 01:27:14.585
Well, just one partner suits me fine.

01:27:15.597 --> 01:27:17.030
Come on.

01:28:59.567 --> 01:29:01.899
Old man, get ready!

01:29:02.570 --> 01:29:04.299
Just you and me now!

01:29:04.472 --> 01:29:06.064
Hooker?

01:29:11.579 --> 01:29:13.274
Hooker?

01:29:38.840 --> 01:29:40.467
The gold...

01:29:40.675 --> 01:29:42.404
...I hid it.

01:29:44.045 --> 01:29:46.206
You kill me, you'll never find it.

01:29:49.684 --> 01:29:53.586
<i>We didn't need the gold to be happy.</i>

01:30:08.770 --> 01:30:10.362
Hurts.

01:30:20.415 --> 01:30:23.077
My claim is yours now.

01:30:23.751 --> 01:30:25.810
I will it to you.

01:30:25.987 --> 01:30:27.352
You'll never find the gold.

01:30:30.525 --> 01:30:32.584
It's nothing but a dream.

01:30:32.860 --> 01:30:34.794
Nothing but a dream.

01:31:50.395 --> 01:31:52.895
