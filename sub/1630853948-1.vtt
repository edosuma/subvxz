(relaxing music)

00:08.394 --> 00:10.977
(upbeat music)

00:19.129 --> 00:21.879
(dramatic music)

00:42.842 --> 00:45.509
(upbeat music)

00:54.960 --> 00:56.130
- Hello people.

00:56.130 --> 00:57.603
It's me, Jeremy again.

00:59.280 --> 01:01.980
Today, I want to talk
about fight or flight.

01:01.980 --> 01:04.620
Now, when you hear fight or flight,

01:04.620 --> 01:06.510
you're usually thinking
about a threatening

01:06.510 --> 01:08.880
situation where you have two options,

01:08.880 --> 01:11.220
fight or flight.

01:11.220 --> 01:13.623
Now, if you choose fight,

01:14.580 --> 01:17.340
you're considered brave,

01:17.340 --> 01:20.100
and courageous,

01:20.100 --> 01:20.973
and bold.

01:23.730 --> 01:25.650
But if you choose flight,

01:25.650 --> 01:29.493
you're weak,

01:30.566 --> 01:31.399
and soft,

01:33.210 --> 01:34.173
and a coward.

01:37.530 --> 01:38.583
Why is that?

01:39.780 --> 01:41.580
Because isn't fight or flight

01:41.580 --> 01:44.313
supposed to achieve the same goal?

01:45.150 --> 01:46.143
To live?

01:51.330 --> 01:54.483
And why do we worry so much
about what other people think.

01:56.550 --> 01:58.740
In high school, it's tough enough

01:58.740 --> 02:01.623
without everyone judging you.

02:07.530 --> 02:09.409
I guess all I want in life is to--

02:09.409 --> 02:11.490
- [Miranda] Jeremy, dinner's ready!

02:11.490 --> 02:12.753
- Coming mom!

02:15.240 --> 02:16.073
You know what?

02:16.073 --> 02:17.726
Forget it, alright?

02:17.726 --> 02:19.560
(upbeat music)

02:19.560 --> 02:21.240
I just want people to
mind their own business

02:21.240 --> 02:24.010
and just live the life
that they wanna live.

02:24.010 --> 02:26.380
You know, and I hope that one day

02:28.260 --> 02:30.810
I'll be able to live a life
I'm happy to live with.

02:34.667 --> 02:36.167
To live out my own dreams.

02:43.530 --> 02:44.430

04:19.770 --> 04:21.330
- Hey!

04:21.330 --> 04:22.620
Whoa, what's up with you today?

04:22.620 --> 04:23.760
You seem happy?

04:23.760 --> 04:25.890
- Well, it's my birthday in two days,

04:25.890 --> 04:28.383
and I'm really excited to be 18.

04:28.383 --> 04:29.687
- Okay, so is that why you're doing

04:29.687 --> 04:30.987
a lot of selfies and posting?

04:30.987 --> 04:32.836
- You know it.

04:32.836 --> 04:34.326
- I'm excited for you, babe.

04:34.326 --> 04:35.880
- Thank you!

04:35.880 --> 04:38.310
All right, I have to go
before Ms. Morris has a fit.

04:38.310 --> 04:39.420
I think she just hates that

04:39.420 --> 04:41.550
I look prettier than her in pink.

04:41.550 --> 04:44.261
- Well, you look prettier
in just about anything.

04:44.261 --> 04:49.261
- [Tiffany] Stop.
(giggles quickly)

04:50.282 --> 04:51.115
- Boo!

04:52.023 --> 04:53.430
- What the hell, Jules!

04:53.430 --> 04:54.513
You scared me.

04:55.410 --> 04:57.150
- I still can't believe you love Tiffany.

04:57.150 --> 04:58.170
She's a fake, Jeremy.

04:58.170 --> 04:59.460
When are you gonna realize that?

04:59.460 --> 05:01.740
- Look, I know that you like Tiffany,

05:01.740 --> 05:02.970
but she isn't gay, okay?

05:02.970 --> 05:04.428
So you can just stop that.

05:04.428 --> 05:05.430
- Yeah, me?

05:05.430 --> 05:06.263
Like Tiffany?

05:06.263 --> 05:07.593
- Yeah.
- Yeah, in your dreams.

05:08.850 --> 05:10.900
I think Alexis is better than her anyway.

05:12.180 --> 05:15.120
- Wait, since when did you and Alexis,

05:15.120 --> 05:17.700
you know, become a thing?

05:17.700 --> 05:19.100
- It's been a few weeks now.

05:20.430 --> 05:21.263
- Good luck.

05:22.440 --> 05:24.330
But I don't need your advice, okay?

05:24.330 --> 05:27.780
Just stay outta my business
and I'll stay outta yours.

05:27.780 --> 05:28.613
I got this.

05:29.593 --> 05:30.843
- Hey Jeremy, look at me.

05:33.442 --> 05:34.530
(giggles quickly)

05:34.530 --> 05:37.410
- Jules, I told you to stop doing that.

05:37.410 --> 05:39.300
- Sorry, I can't help it.

05:39.300 --> 05:42.030
Your cheeks, they're kinda
like a magnet for my hand,

05:42.030 --> 05:43.440
plus I love doing it way too much.

05:43.440 --> 05:44.829
- Go away, Jules.

05:44.829 --> 05:46.800
- (sighs quickly) Fine.

05:46.800 --> 05:48.400
But just remember I told you so.

05:58.107 --> 05:58.940
- Hi.

05:58.940 --> 06:00.440
- Oh!

06:00.440 --> 06:01.902
Hi, Dr. Vasan.

06:01.902 --> 06:02.777
I know, I know,

06:02.777 --> 06:05.103
No cell phones, I'm
putting it away right now.

06:06.240 --> 06:07.073
- Wait a minute.

06:08.460 --> 06:12.090
So how are you and your
mom doing since everything?

06:12.090 --> 06:15.330
- Oh, my mom's good,

06:15.330 --> 06:16.863
I'm good, we are good.

06:19.710 --> 06:20.610
We don't need him.

06:21.930 --> 06:23.883
I'm gonna get to class, can't be tardy.

06:25.660 --> 06:29.079
(Dr Vasan sighing quickly)

06:29.079 --> 06:31.260
(emotional music)

06:31.260 --> 06:33.780
- So Tiff, um,

06:33.780 --> 06:35.250
you're going to homecoming with me, right?

06:35.250 --> 06:36.810
- Hey!

06:36.810 --> 06:38.043
Yeah, of course.

06:39.960 --> 06:41.700
- Okay, so you can come by and have dinner

06:41.700 --> 06:43.950
with me and my family tonight?

06:43.950 --> 06:45.154
- Tonight?

06:45.154 --> 06:48.420
I can't 'cause my brother's
getting back from India,

06:48.420 --> 06:50.734
so, rain check?

06:50.734 --> 06:51.567
- Yeah, sure.

06:51.567 --> 06:52.400
Next time.

06:52.400 --> 06:53.333
- Yeah, next time.

06:53.333 --> 06:54.166
- [Young Girl] Hey Tiff.

06:54.166 --> 06:55.120
- Hey, call me later okay?

06:57.660 --> 06:59.253
- So how about next week?

07:00.420 --> 07:01.830
- Yeah,

07:01.830 --> 07:03.680
let me get back to you on that, okay?

07:08.280 --> 07:09.113
Hey!

07:10.380 --> 07:11.576
I love you.

07:11.576 --> 07:13.427
- Love you too.

07:13.427 --> 07:15.243
- Oh hey, this is my ride.

07:17.400 --> 07:19.800
We can do dinner, but you
know what I'd really love?

07:19.800 --> 07:21.090
- What's that?

07:21.090 --> 07:22.260
- Sundae Shakes.

07:22.260 --> 07:24.090
I love their cheesy fries.

- Me?

07:46.547 --> 07:49.530
Not really, but maybe one day.

07:49.530 --> 07:51.567

07:51.567 --> 07:53.100
You might as well be one now.

07:53.100 --> 07:53.933

08:04.903 --> 08:06.152
- Hey, wait.

08:06.152 --> 08:08.733
A face like yours should
be on billboards downtown.

08:09.840 --> 08:11.370
I got a friend who runs an agency.

08:11.370 --> 08:12.810
Would you be interested?

08:12.810 --> 08:13.800
I could connect you two.

08:13.800 --> 08:15.660
- An agency, like a modeling agency?

08:15.660 --> 08:18.780
- Yeah, so what do you say?

08:18.780 --> 08:20.399
- Um, I don't,

08:20.399 --> 08:22.290
(laughs quickly) I don't know.

08:22.290 --> 08:23.709
I'll have to think about it.

08:23.709 --> 08:24.542
- Okay, look,

08:24.542 --> 08:27.540
I only refer girls to him if
I think they have something.

08:27.540 --> 08:30.202
When I see you, I see something.

08:30.202 --> 08:31.533
You could be a big star.

08:35.100 --> 08:37.740
All you gotta do is
just send him an email.

08:37.740 --> 08:39.190
This could be your big break.

08:42.553 --> 08:46.401
- Okay.
(giggles quickly)

08:46.401 --> 08:48.210
- Look, just email him,

08:48.210 --> 08:49.807
tell him Richard sent you.

08:49.807 --> 08:52.780
You could make some money out of it.

08:52.780 --> 08:55.751
- Okay, thanks.

09:34.633 --> 09:36.210
(Miranda yells quickly)

09:36.210 --> 09:38.730
- Boy, stop sneaking up on me like that.

09:38.730 --> 09:40.398
Where have you been?

09:40.398 --> 09:42.183
- Just hanging out with Tiffany?

09:43.200 --> 09:44.910
- Oh, Tiffany.

09:44.910 --> 09:45.930
How is she doing?

09:45.930 --> 09:49.860
I seen some of her little selfies.

09:49.860 --> 09:51.183
Is she keeping warm?

09:52.448 --> 09:53.281
- (laughs quickly) Yes, mom.

09:53.281 --> 09:54.900
She is!

09:54.900 --> 09:58.380
You know, she just trying to be a model.

09:58.380 --> 09:59.220
- Hmm, oh.

09:59.220 --> 10:03.515
So I made some of your
favorite, honey garlic chicken.

10:03.515 --> 10:04.348
- [Jeremy] For real?

10:04.348 --> 10:05.910
- Uh-huh, your dad will be home soon,

10:05.910 --> 10:07.860
so clean your room and get
started on that homework,

10:07.860 --> 10:08.693
all right?

10:08.693 --> 10:09.533
- All right.

10:09.533 --> 10:11.327
(Miranda giggling quickly)

10:11.327 --> 10:13.744
(pop music)

10:16.530 --> 10:19.054
So how was work?

10:19.054 --> 10:20.233
- Stressful.

10:20.233 --> 10:21.600
But I will tell you what?

10:21.600 --> 10:23.940
I sure am looking forward to
our little vacation coming up.

10:23.940 --> 10:24.773
- Me too!

10:26.753 --> 10:27.750
- Ew, guys.

10:27.750 --> 10:28.583
Ugh.

10:30.293 --> 10:31.126
Stop.

10:31.126 --> 10:33.043
- So son, how's school?

10:34.919 --> 10:36.582
- It's fine, dad.

10:36.582 --> 10:38.842
- You're going to homecoming, right?

10:38.842 --> 10:40.675
- Yeah, with Tiffany.

10:42.180 --> 10:43.013
- Tiffany?

10:44.520 --> 10:45.627
Son, how many times do I gotta tell you?

10:45.627 --> 10:47.673
You gotta watch out for girls like that!

10:49.080 --> 10:50.550
- George.

10:50.550 --> 10:52.747
Jeremy likes her, let it go.

10:52.747 --> 10:54.810
- Baby, I'm just trying
to protect the boy.

10:54.810 --> 10:56.610
I don't wanna see him get hurt.

10:56.610 --> 10:59.430
Sooner or later, she's going to leave him.

10:59.430 --> 11:01.233
- Dad, you don't know that.

11:02.760 --> 11:04.053
- Jeremy, eat your food.

11:05.556 --> 11:07.639
George, leave him alone.

11:09.420 --> 11:11.013
- Tiffany's not gonna leave me.

11:16.648 --> 11:19.144
- All right, all right.

11:19.144 --> 11:21.134
(tense music)

11:21.134 --> 11:25.168
(door knocking loudly)

11:25.168 --> 11:26.430
- Hey.
- What do you want, Ethan?

11:26.430 --> 11:28.353
- Thing is, help me out?

11:29.280 --> 11:30.390
- What did I tell you about turning

11:30.390 --> 11:31.863
up on my doorstep this late?

11:33.346 --> 11:35.640
- You said to call, but I'm sorry,

11:35.640 --> 11:38.340
I just figured you'd be good
for it, if you don't mind.

11:38.340 --> 11:39.173
- But I do mind.

11:40.830 --> 11:42.630
- Please Hunter, come on.

11:42.630 --> 11:44.190
Just a little.

11:44.190 --> 11:45.240
I'll be out the door.

11:48.368 --> 11:50.169
- Come on in.

11:50.169 --> 11:53.317
(R'n'B Music)

11:53.317 --> 11:55.767
I've been seeing your girl
post a lot of selfies.

11:57.248 --> 11:58.081
- What?

11:59.310 --> 12:00.143
- Your girl.

12:01.200 --> 12:03.000
She's been posting a lot of selfies.

12:06.007 --> 12:08.056
- She's not my girl.

12:08.056 --> 12:08.973
- For real?

12:09.810 --> 12:11.310
What happened between you two?

12:33.930 --> 12:35.380
I'm not gonna tell you again.

12:37.110 --> 12:38.410
You better call next time.

12:39.810 --> 12:40.643
- Yeah, sorry.

12:56.695 --> 12:59.195
(eerie music)

13:07.891 --> 13:10.724
(emotional music)

13:31.890 --> 13:34.040
- Jeremy, Tiffany's fighting with Ethan!

13:34.040 --> 13:35.673
- What?

13:35.673 --> 13:38.423
(dramatic music)

13:41.355 --> 13:43.803
- One more word about Jeremy
and you're dead, Ethan.

13:43.803 --> 13:45.570
- Who, that nerdy Black kid?

13:45.570 --> 13:46.403
Tiff, he's a coward.

13:46.403 --> 13:48.090
- What is your problem with him anyway?

13:48.090 --> 13:49.550
It's not like he ever did anything to you.

13:49.550 --> 13:50.520
- He didn't do anything to me?

13:50.520 --> 13:51.510
He stole you away from me!

13:51.510 --> 13:54.273
- We were over before
we even started, Ethan.

13:58.080 --> 14:00.979
Jeremy, come show Ethan that
you're not afraid of him.

14:00.979 --> 14:02.610
You know, you might look tough,

14:02.610 --> 14:03.990
but you're pathetic.

14:03.990 --> 14:04.950
Jeremy and I are together.

14:04.950 --> 14:07.170
You're just gonna have to deal with it.

14:07.170 --> 14:10.829
Besides, you're too self-centered
to even care about me.

14:10.829 --> 14:12.157
- What are you looking at?

14:12.157 --> 14:13.440
If you've got any balls,

14:13.440 --> 14:16.320
then step out from behind your girlfriend.

14:16.320 --> 14:17.153
What's up?

14:18.342 --> 14:20.693
(tense music)

14:20.693 --> 14:21.923
- [Tiffany] (yells) Jeremy?

14:23.430 --> 14:24.960
- See?

14:24.960 --> 14:25.793
What a coward.

14:28.517 --> 14:30.450
(Tiffany grunting angrily)

14:30.450 --> 14:31.440
- All right, all right.

14:31.440 --> 14:32.490
What's going on here?

14:33.360 --> 14:34.484
You all need to get to class.

14:34.484 --> 14:35.748
- (yells) Leave!

14:35.748 --> 14:38.094
- Get to your classes.

14:38.094 --> 14:40.844
(dramatic music)

14:43.338 --> 14:44.588
- Come with me.

14:50.400 --> 14:53.040
Ethan, what happened?

14:53.040 --> 14:53.873
- Nothing.

14:59.730 --> 15:03.180
- Coach Fields said you are
not playing football this year.

15:03.180 --> 15:04.013
Why not?

15:05.370 --> 15:06.770
- I don't feel like playing.

15:08.940 --> 15:10.740
- How are you and your father doing?

15:18.300 --> 15:19.830
Ethan.

15:19.830 --> 15:22.230
Sometimes the pain we feel leads us

15:22.230 --> 15:24.600
to make destructive decisions.

15:24.600 --> 15:25.433
- We done?

15:29.640 --> 15:30.810
- Ethan.

15:30.810 --> 15:33.780
There are some people who care about you.

15:33.780 --> 15:36.000
My door is always open.

15:36.000 --> 15:39.153
You can come here anytime
if you need to talk.

15:40.484 --> 15:43.199
- Nobody cares about me.

15:43.199 --> 15:46.032
(emotional music)

16:12.180 --> 16:15.463
- So Jeremy, what are you going to do?

16:19.224 --> 16:20.057
- Huh?

16:20.057 --> 16:21.783
- What are you going to do?

16:24.060 --> 16:25.800
- I was gonna go to class.

16:25.800 --> 16:27.210
I mean, I don't,

16:27.210 --> 16:28.590
you know, hang out in the hallways--

16:28.590 --> 16:30.930
- This is your senior year.

16:30.930 --> 16:32.370
You are coming to in this year

16:32.370 --> 16:35.823
with 4.2 GPA and a great attendance.

16:36.960 --> 16:39.753
- Oh, I really don't
know what I'm gonna do.

16:42.000 --> 16:44.350
I'm sorry, is this about
what happened earlier?

16:49.020 --> 16:49.853
- Jeremy.

16:50.730 --> 16:53.400
You are among the few students who have

16:53.400 --> 16:56.133
a perfect grade point
average in this school.

16:57.810 --> 16:59.013
It says a lot.

17:00.210 --> 17:02.243
Do you know what that means?

17:02.243 --> 17:06.870
- I don't know, that I
do a lot of homework?

17:06.870 --> 17:08.073
- Valedictorian.

17:09.180 --> 17:12.630
Not only that, it means
you need to be a leader,

17:12.630 --> 17:13.623
not be a follower.

17:14.610 --> 17:18.180
- Not a leader, just a regular guy.

17:18.180 --> 17:20.195
Got a great GPA,

17:20.195 --> 17:23.883
and I can't even stand up for myself.

17:24.720 --> 17:29.520
- Being a leader is not
about fighting, but strength.

17:29.520 --> 17:32.460
It's about you being an influence

17:32.460 --> 17:34.713
and not being influenced by others.

17:35.730 --> 17:40.473
You have to guide your peers
and not to be led by the crowd.

17:42.570 --> 17:43.403
You understand?

17:45.320 --> 17:46.773
Go and think about it.

17:47.680 --> 17:50.097
Now you can go to your class.

17:52.732 --> 17:54.810
- About Ethan, okay,

17:54.810 --> 17:56.410
I didn't think he was gonna
come at me like that and--

17:56.410 --> 17:58.827
- Enjoy the rest of your day.

18:20.782 --> 18:23.673
- Hey.

18:24.570 --> 18:25.800
- Look at me, Jeremy.

18:25.800 --> 18:27.390
What happened?

18:27.390 --> 18:28.530
- I just hate fights.

18:28.530 --> 18:31.170
- I know that, but Tiffany's pissed.

18:31.170 --> 18:33.045
She feels like you embarrassed her.

18:33.045 --> 18:34.800
- No, but I can't fight Ethan.

18:34.800 --> 18:37.290
- [Jules] You know he's
not gonna let this go.

18:37.290 --> 18:38.220
- Yeah, I know.

18:38.220 --> 18:40.620
- And Tiffany, what are
you gonna do about that?

18:40.620 --> 18:43.470
- Just gonna have to
apologize to her, I guess.

18:43.470 --> 18:46.200
- Okay, but not a plain apology,

18:46.200 --> 18:47.190
a cute, sweet,

18:47.190 --> 18:48.947
romantic apology?

18:48.947 --> 18:52.020
- I don't know if I can do that, Jules,

18:52.020 --> 18:53.073
but I'll try!

19:01.950 --> 19:05.125
- (imitating Yoda) Do or
do not, there is no trying.

19:05.125 --> 19:08.850
(giggling quickly)

19:08.850 --> 19:10.410
- Thanks Jules.

19:10.410 --> 19:11.970
- Nah, keep your thank you's.

19:11.970 --> 19:14.922
Just have your mom make me some
of her honey garlic chicken.

19:14.922 --> 19:16.122
- (laughs quickly) Done.

19:17.340 --> 19:20.670
- But seriously, you can't
let people punk you like that.

19:20.670 --> 19:21.720
- Okay, I know,

19:21.720 --> 19:23.010
alright?

19:23.010 --> 19:24.390
I know!

19:24.390 --> 19:25.690
- Well, at least you know.

19:27.180 --> 19:29.100
Anyway, I gotta get home
and do some studying.

19:29.100 --> 19:30.150
I have a test tomorrow in history

19:30.150 --> 19:31.500
and would hate to get an F.

19:33.060 --> 19:33.893
See you!

19:36.000 --> 19:37.443
- Hey Jules, wait.

19:43.170 --> 19:44.003
Thanks.

19:46.890 --> 19:48.753
- Jeremy, you know I didn't do hugs.

19:49.800 --> 19:51.630
- Ah, whatever.

19:51.630 --> 19:53.403
- Bye.
- Bye!

19:56.289 --> 19:58.706
(lofi music)

20:03.632 --> 20:06.882
(phone pinging loudly)

20:20.358 --> 20:22.020
Hey Tiff.

20:22.020 --> 20:23.013
- Jeremy, stop!

20:28.290 --> 20:31.085
- Sorry about what happened earlier, okay?

20:31.085 --> 20:31.918
I just couldn't--

20:31.918 --> 20:33.990
- What couldn't you do, Jeremy?

20:33.990 --> 20:34.823
Fight for me?

20:34.823 --> 20:36.570
Show Ethan that you weren't a coward?

20:36.570 --> 20:38.124
'Cause yeah, you couldn't do that.

20:38.124 --> 20:38.957
- [Jeremy] Look, it's not like that.

20:38.957 --> 20:41.523
- I don't want to hear
another word, Jeremy.

20:42.630 --> 20:44.490
I thought you were special,

20:44.490 --> 20:45.570
different from other guys,

20:45.570 --> 20:46.620
and I guess you are,

20:46.620 --> 20:49.710
just not in the way I
thought you would be.

20:49.710 --> 20:50.543
- Tiffany.

20:50.543 --> 20:51.376
I know, okay?

20:51.376 --> 20:53.790
And I'm not even too proud
about what happened either.

20:53.790 --> 20:54.623
Alright?

20:54.623 --> 20:55.456
But just understand that sometimes I can--

20:55.456 --> 20:56.370
- There's nothing to understand, Jeremy.

20:56.370 --> 20:58.110
No, you're a coward.

20:58.110 --> 20:58.950
You can't fight for me,

20:58.950 --> 21:00.360
and you can't even fight for yourself,

21:00.360 --> 21:02.040
and I'm done.

21:02.040 --> 21:02.880
- Tiffany wait, okay?

21:02.880 --> 21:05.100
- I wish it didn't have to come to this,

21:05.100 --> 21:06.807
but today you proved to
me that I need a man,

21:06.807 --> 21:08.932
and you're still a little boy.

21:08.932 --> 21:11.608
Even Ethan was willing to fight for me.

21:11.608 --> 21:12.490
- Tiffany, just hear me out--

21:12.490 --> 21:13.380
- [Tiffany] Goodbye Jeremy.

21:13.380 --> 21:14.368
- Tiffany wait, let me just say--

21:14.368 --> 21:15.767
- (yells loudly) No Jeremy, I'm done!

23:09.242 --> 23:10.537

23:10.537 --> 23:12.870
- I was at a friend's house.

23:14.323 --> 23:15.490
- Come inside.

23:24.971 --> 23:26.490
What did I tell you about
coming in this house drunk?

23:26.490 --> 23:27.600
- I'm sorry dad, I
wouldn't have come home.

23:27.600 --> 23:28.783
I didn't know you were home.

23:28.783 --> 23:29.616
- No, no,
no.

23:29.616 --> 23:30.900
Sorry is not gonna cut it tonight.

23:30.900 --> 23:32.150

23:39.090 --> 23:40.801
You know the rules, boy.

23:40.801 --> 23:42.634
- [Ethan] Dad, please!

23:45.390 --> 23:49.413
- You need to understand the
value of hard work, Ethan.

23:50.370 --> 23:52.508
No more drinking and partying!

23:52.508 --> 23:53.341
(Ethan grunting loudly)

23:53.341 --> 23:54.334
- (yells) Dad, dad,
please, please.

23:54.334 --> 23:55.167
I won't drink again!

23:55.167 --> 23:56.000
Please--

23:56.000 --> 23:57.733
- How dare you raise your
voice at me, shut up.

23:59.437 --> 24:02.913
I thought I would give you a chance,

24:05.130 --> 24:06.608
but you know what?

24:06.608 --> 24:10.413
You are the biggest
disappointment in my life.

24:14.430 --> 24:16.290
You're grounded for a month.

24:16.290 --> 24:19.020
I want you to come
straight home from school.

24:19.020 --> 24:20.570
You understand what I'm saying?

24:22.260 --> 24:24.630
Do you understand what I'm saying?

24:24.630 --> 24:25.463
- Yes, sir.

24:29.310 --> 24:34.310
- I work hard, and all he
does is drink and have fun.

24:47.253 --> 24:51.336
(video game gun shooting loudly)

24:54.810 --> 24:57.780
(door knocking loudly)

24:57.780 --> 24:59.287
Who the hell is that?

25:08.425 --> 25:09.814
Caitlin!

25:09.814 --> 25:10.647
- Hi!

25:10.647 --> 25:13.470
- Hey, what are you doing here?

25:13.470 --> 25:15.510
- Actually, I brought you some

25:15.510 --> 25:17.430
leftover apple pie from the get together.

25:17.430 --> 25:19.230
I thought you and your
son would like some.

25:19.230 --> 25:20.853
- Yes, thank you.

25:21.750 --> 25:23.250
That's very thoughtful of you.

25:24.090 --> 25:24.940
- You're welcome.

25:27.240 --> 25:30.777
- Would you like to come inside
and have a glass of wine or?

25:32.244 --> 25:34.199
- That is so sweet of you,

25:34.199 --> 25:36.240
but I think I must pass.

25:36.240 --> 25:38.043
I have already had too much tonight.

25:39.174 --> 25:40.007
So.

25:40.920 --> 25:41.753
- Come on.

25:43.830 --> 25:45.420
Please?

25:45.420 --> 25:46.980
Come on, just a glass,

25:46.980 --> 25:47.813
or half a glass!

25:49.230 --> 25:50.760
- All right, okay.

25:50.760 --> 25:53.697
Half a glass can't hurt, so.

25:53.697 --> 25:54.780
- Can't hurt!

25:56.222 --> 25:58.722
(blues music)

26:10.120 --> 26:11.537
- Hm, delicious.

26:13.590 --> 26:15.157
- Thank you.

26:15.157 --> 26:17.700
Yeah, my sister got it for me in France.

26:17.700 --> 26:18.603
- That's amazing.

26:21.060 --> 26:24.180
- You know, I could get you a bottle.

26:24.180 --> 26:25.013
- Really?

26:26.067 --> 26:28.110
I would love to share
this with my husband.

26:28.110 --> 26:28.943
Thank you, Tim.

26:32.630 --> 26:33.713
- No problem.

26:39.434 --> 26:41.934
- I should probably leave now.

26:45.180 --> 26:46.280
Ah, it's getting late.

26:48.510 --> 26:50.103
- Okay.

26:50.103 --> 26:51.953
- Thank you.
- Sure.

26:59.990 --> 27:02.490
- So I will see you later then?

27:02.490 --> 27:05.130
- Sure, you know where I live.

27:05.130 --> 27:07.233
- Yes, thank you Tim.

27:08.610 --> 27:09.964
- Don't mention it.

27:09.964 --> 27:12.749
- Yeah.

27:12.749 --> 27:17.070
What if I stop by again
tomorrow night around this time?

27:17.070 --> 27:19.050
My husband's in Canada for business, so.

27:19.050 --> 27:20.238
- Yes!

27:20.238 --> 27:23.220
Yes, that would be great.

27:23.220 --> 27:25.683
- All right, well it's a date.

27:27.600 --> 27:28.433
- It's a date.

27:30.695 --> 27:31.528
- Okay, bye.

27:48.139 --> 27:50.806
(comical music)

27:51.957 --> 27:53.400
- Boo!

27:53.400 --> 27:55.890
- Jules, I told you to stop doing that.

27:55.890 --> 27:57.303
- Sorry, I can't help it.

27:58.920 --> 28:00.243
Anyway, how are you doing?

28:02.085 --> 28:03.840
- I just feel...

28:03.840 --> 28:04.673
- Empty?

28:06.030 --> 28:07.170
- Yeah.

28:07.170 --> 28:09.060
- Hey, think positive.

28:09.060 --> 28:10.980
One, because I hate negative people,

28:10.980 --> 28:13.930
and two, because thinking
negatively won't do you any good.

28:15.990 --> 28:17.280
Look, Jeremy.

28:17.280 --> 28:18.420
I get it.

28:18.420 --> 28:21.300
I won't even tell you to forget
about Tiffany or anything.

28:21.300 --> 28:23.490
I just know you'll find
someone better than her.

28:23.490 --> 28:26.490
You know she's not the
only fish in the pond.

28:26.490 --> 28:28.590
- Jules, it's fish in the sea.

28:28.590 --> 28:29.540
- Yeah, same thing.

28:30.720 --> 28:32.520
Oh, I almost forgot.

28:32.520 --> 28:33.990
Did you hear about Ethan?

28:33.990 --> 28:35.100
- No, what happened?

28:35.100 --> 28:36.090
- I heard he went to a party

28:36.090 --> 28:37.470
the other night and came home late,

28:37.470 --> 28:39.630
and his dad got pissed and
beat the hell out of him.

28:39.630 --> 28:41.190
- Really?
- Uh-huh.

28:41.190 --> 28:43.530
Nelson said he was with this guy, Hunter.

28:43.530 --> 28:44.550
We've heard of him, haven't you?

28:44.550 --> 28:45.840
- Yeah, I read about him in a couple

28:45.840 --> 28:48.300
of newspapers like that before.

28:48.300 --> 28:49.410
- Newspapers?

28:49.410 --> 28:52.383
Seriously Jeremy, what
century are you living in?

28:53.412 --> 28:54.543
- Hey, quiet!

28:56.100 --> 28:57.750
- Whatever.

28:57.750 --> 28:59.430
Now Ethan didn't come to school today

28:59.430 --> 29:02.466
and Nelson's too scared to go
to his house and check on him.

29:02.466 --> 29:05.047
- Man, I'm pretty sure
Ethan would be okay.

29:05.047 --> 29:07.830
I just hope he doesn't come
back until after graduation.

29:07.830 --> 29:10.110
- You know, I still feel bad for him.

29:10.110 --> 29:11.640
Okay sure, he's a bully,

29:11.640 --> 29:13.830
but what his dad did still isn't right.

29:13.830 --> 29:15.090
- Forget about Ethan, okay?

29:15.090 --> 29:16.830
Look, I need you right now.

29:16.830 --> 29:17.663
All right?

29:17.663 --> 29:19.380
And you're the only
one that I can talk to.

29:19.380 --> 29:21.833
- You're just mad that
Ethan punked you, that's it.

29:24.120 --> 29:26.610
But you know, I may have to agree

29:26.610 --> 29:29.160
with Tiffany a little bit on this one.

29:29.160 --> 29:30.630
- Jules, not you too.

29:30.630 --> 29:31.463
- No, like,

29:31.463 --> 29:32.970
believe it or not, she's right.

29:32.970 --> 29:34.713
You are a bit of a coward.

29:35.850 --> 29:37.170
- Bye Jules.

29:37.170 --> 29:38.127
- No, look.

29:38.127 --> 29:40.620
Can you just step it up and be brave?

29:40.620 --> 29:43.230
Be that night in shining
armor for Tiffany.

29:43.230 --> 29:45.600
If not Tiffany, then for someone else.

29:45.600 --> 29:46.740
The point is sometimes you need

29:46.740 --> 29:48.290
to put up your fists and fight.

29:49.500 --> 29:50.333
You know me.

29:50.333 --> 29:52.270
No matter what, I'll
always be here for you.

29:53.209 --> 29:55.983
But Jeremy, you need to
stop being so scared.

29:56.820 --> 29:57.693
- Scared?

29:59.550 --> 30:01.710
Don't you tell me about being scared.

30:01.710 --> 30:03.330
You're the one that's
scared to tell your parents

30:03.330 --> 30:04.980
about what the piano teacher did.

30:06.394 --> 30:09.003
- Can you two keep it quiet, please.

30:12.150 --> 30:12.983
- Jules, look.

30:12.983 --> 30:13.816
I'm sorry!

30:17.340 --> 30:18.620
Way to go, Jeremy.

30:22.773 --> 30:25.606
(emotional music)

30:30.559 --> 30:31.476
- Ms Smith?

30:32.810 --> 30:34.556
Is everything okay.

30:34.556 --> 30:37.500
- Yeah, I just can't get this damn.

30:37.500 --> 30:38.850
I can't get my locker open.

30:42.440 --> 30:43.790
- Go and wait in my office.

30:47.190 --> 30:49.020
Tell me the number.

30:49.020 --> 30:50.073
- 17.

30:51.034 --> 30:52.369
- [Mr Vasan] 17.

30:52.369 --> 30:53.789
- 32.

30:53.789 --> 30:54.622
- [Mr Vasan] 32.

30:54.622 --> 30:55.455
- 17.

30:56.354 --> 30:57.187
- 17.

30:59.970 --> 31:01.110
Open!

31:01.110 --> 31:02.760
- Thanks.

31:02.760 --> 31:04.740
- I know it can be hard to find

31:04.740 --> 31:06.960
the words when you are hurting,

31:06.960 --> 31:09.273
but sometimes it helps to try.

31:10.960 --> 31:11.793
For all of us.

31:20.970 --> 31:22.037
- Oh my God.

31:23.767 --> 31:25.350
That feels so good.

31:26.852 --> 31:29.308
Where did you learn to do that?

31:29.308 --> 31:31.773
- I have always been good with my hands.

31:33.427 --> 31:35.531
- I bet you are.

31:35.531 --> 31:36.600
(tense music)

31:36.600 --> 31:39.576
- I actually thought about
going to school for this.

31:39.576 --> 31:40.409
- Oh?

31:42.813 --> 31:43.646
Oh!

31:45.277 --> 31:47.777
(tense music)

32:24.196 --> 32:26.026
(loud thumping music in distance)

32:26.026 --> 32:29.359
(door knocking quietly)

32:31.701 --> 32:35.034
(door knocking quietly)

32:39.702 --> 32:42.952
(door knocking loudly)

32:52.872 --> 32:55.580
(loud rap music)

32:55.580 --> 32:56.997
- Where's Hunter?

33:12.568 --> 33:14.033
(door knocking quietly)

33:14.033 --> 33:15.717
- [Hunter] Who is it?

33:15.717 --> 33:18.088
- Yo, it's me,
Ethan.

33:18.088 --> 33:19.171
- Come on in.

33:24.683 --> 33:26.097
Woo!

33:26.097 --> 33:27.903
Now that's what I call a kick.

33:33.240 --> 33:36.453
So what do you need today?

33:38.220 --> 33:39.753
- Just the usual.

33:41.499 --> 33:42.627
I don't got it.

33:42.627 --> 33:45.092
But I promise you, you
know I'm good for 100.

33:45.092 --> 33:46.113
I'll get it.

33:48.090 --> 33:50.003
- You know I don't play about my money.

33:52.080 --> 33:53.030
You know the rules.

33:54.540 --> 33:57.633
First the money, and then
you can get the candies.

34:00.240 --> 34:01.944
- I mean, this is all I have,

34:01.944 --> 34:04.470
all I've got right now.

34:04.470 --> 34:07.230
- Are you seriously
joking with me right now?

34:07.230 --> 34:08.370
You think you can just come up here

34:08.370 --> 34:09.450
and do whatever you please?

34:09.450 --> 34:11.520
You think I'm gonna give you quality

34:11.520 --> 34:13.020
stuff for a couple of dollars?

34:14.700 --> 34:15.660
Huh?

34:15.660 --> 34:16.767
- It's all I got.

34:17.793 --> 34:19.230
- Then get the hell out of here before I

34:19.230 --> 34:21.380
slice your balls off
and throw them to her.

34:22.980 --> 34:24.473
You'd love them, wouldn't you?

34:27.708 --> 34:29.130
- I'm sorry, Hunter.

34:29.130 --> 34:29.963
- Get out.

34:30.870 --> 34:31.703
Get out!

34:35.522 --> 34:38.272
(loud rap music)

34:51.810 --> 34:52.860
- Hey!

34:52.860 --> 34:53.693
- What?

34:53.693 --> 34:54.526
- [Violet] What's wrong?

34:54.526 --> 34:55.359
What do you want from me?

34:55.359 --> 34:58.080
- What the hell happened to your eye?

34:58.080 --> 34:59.850
Okay, don't answer,

34:59.850 --> 35:02.695
but I can get you some
candies if you want.

35:02.695 --> 35:03.849
- How?

35:03.849 --> 35:07.516
♪ Low, I don't want you low ♪

35:23.356 --> 35:27.189
(car engine rumbling quietly)

35:29.883 --> 35:30.723
- He's gone.

35:31.740 --> 35:34.290
- Yeah, you sure he's
got what we need though?

35:34.290 --> 35:35.956
- Trust me.

35:35.956 --> 35:37.500
- All right, where's it at?

35:37.500 --> 35:39.900
- Look in the master
bathroom, under the sink.

35:39.900 --> 35:42.723
He keeps it in a black
box with a red top on it.

35:46.349 --> 35:49.349
(suspenseful music)

35:50.850 --> 35:51.683
Hurry up!

35:51.683 --> 35:52.890
- Why don't you wake up the whole

35:52.890 --> 35:54.443
neighborhood while you're at it?

36:13.453 --> 36:15.953

(car clicking loudly)

36:42.067 --> 36:44.817

36:48.955 --> 36:49.940
- Woo, it's cold.

36:49.940 --> 36:50.773
Go on in, baby.

36:50.773 --> 36:51.810
- It's so cold--

36:51.810 --> 36:52.910
- Welcome to my house!

36:53.885 --> 36:55.110
- Wow, it's beautiful.

36:55.110 --> 36:56.590
- Let me take this off you.

37:05.716 --> 37:06.966
Just traveling.

37:09.668 --> 37:11.720
Anyway, how about it?

37:11.720 --> 37:12.803
How about it?

37:14.332 --> 37:17.665
(girl laughing quickly)

37:19.320 --> 37:21.870
I can't believe that he
pulled that off, can you?

37:21.870 --> 37:23.370
- Oh my God, I can't either.

37:23.370 --> 37:26.967
- While we're in, I am so glad
Kendall introduced me to you.

37:26.967 --> 37:28.950
- I'm so glad too.

37:28.950 --> 37:30.600
- You look so hot in that outfit.

37:32.850 --> 37:35.703
We can talk about that a little bit later.

37:37.240 --> 37:40.293
But first talk about this.

37:50.274 --> 37:51.536
(loud banging)

37:51.536 --> 37:52.398
- Did you hear that--
- What was that?

37:52.398 --> 37:53.648
- I don't know.

37:59.557 --> 38:00.474
Hold still.

38:01.781 --> 38:04.281
(tense music)

38:28.860 --> 38:31.470
- Do you lure guys like that all the time?

38:31.470 --> 38:32.940
- Lure?

38:32.940 --> 38:33.773
Look.

38:33.773 --> 38:35.070
- [Ethan] You almost got me killed.

38:35.070 --> 38:37.620
- You gotta do what you
gotta do to survive, right?

38:45.210 --> 38:46.350
Wait!

38:46.350 --> 38:49.590
(upbeat music)

38:49.590 --> 38:51.623
There's no need to rush.

38:51.623 --> 38:53.370
- What about Hunter?

38:53.370 --> 38:55.050
- What about him?

38:55.050 --> 38:56.313
He doesn't own me.

38:57.240 --> 39:00.030
Why, are you scared of him?

39:00.030 --> 39:01.760
- No, um...

39:04.176 --> 39:05.520
I should go.

39:05.520 --> 39:06.353
- Are you sure?

39:06.353 --> 39:08.103
I've got the room all night.

39:11.236 --> 39:13.027
- Yeah, yeah,
I should go.

39:35.310 --> 39:36.143
- No.

39:40.170 --> 39:41.170
What about this one?

39:42.360 --> 39:43.193
- Sexy.

39:44.782 --> 39:45.930
- [Jules] (voicemail) It's Jules!

39:45.930 --> 39:47.780
I'll give you a call back when I can.

39:54.170 --> 39:57.003

40:01.920 --> 40:03.958

40:03.958 --> 40:06.041
Even Ethan fought for me.

40:06.990 --> 40:07.823
- [Jules] No, like,

40:07.823 --> 40:09.672
believe it or not, she's right.

Jeremy?

40:26.880 --> 40:27.713
Boy?

40:28.680 --> 40:30.690
- Dad, I told you to
knock before you come in.

40:30.690 --> 40:32.580
- I did knock, and I called
your name three times.

40:32.580 --> 40:34.643
What are you doing, listening
to that mumble music?

40:35.580 --> 40:37.050
Listen, your mother and I
are leaving first thing.

40:37.050 --> 40:37.883
We'll be gone a week.

40:37.883 --> 40:40.530
You can have one or two
friends over, but no parties.

40:40.530 --> 40:41.363
Understand?

40:42.450 --> 40:43.283
- Alright.

40:45.150 --> 40:48.240
- Listen, be careful wearing
that hoodie around town.

40:48.240 --> 40:49.830
You heard about what happened
to that boy in Florida.

40:49.830 --> 40:51.892
He was the same age as you.

40:51.892 --> 40:53.100
So when you walking
through this neighborhood,

40:53.100 --> 40:54.420
don't have that hoodie up.

40:54.420 --> 40:57.549
Some people might be
scaredy scared of you.

40:57.549 --> 40:59.573
- Scared of me?

40:59.573 --> 41:00.573
Yeah right.

41:01.597 --> 41:02.883
- Love you, son.

41:03.810 --> 41:04.810
- Love you too, dad.

41:06.210 --> 41:07.043
- Oh, one more thing.

41:07.043 --> 41:07.876
Make sure--

41:07.876 --> 41:09.528
- [Miranda] George, I'm ready!

41:09.528 --> 41:11.373
- You know what, nevermind.

41:12.570 --> 41:13.403
- Ugh, nasty.

41:17.605 --> 41:18.472
(school bell ringing loudly)

41:18.472 --> 41:21.087
(students chatting quickly)

41:21.087 --> 41:21.920
- All right, all right.

41:21.920 --> 41:23.906
All right, settle down.

41:23.906 --> 41:25.656
Excuse me, thank you.

41:26.790 --> 41:28.140
All right.

41:28.140 --> 41:31.016
So today we're gonna do a
little writing assignment.

41:31.016 --> 41:32.223
(students groaning quickly)

41:32.223 --> 41:34.770
(groans loudly) Come on, guys.

41:34.770 --> 41:35.603
Believe me.

41:35.603 --> 41:38.523
It's not going to be easy,
but the topic is fear.

41:39.390 --> 41:42.960
Many of us have one fear or
another hidden inside of us,

41:42.960 --> 41:45.990
and it could be the fear of spiders,

41:45.990 --> 41:48.660
or the fear of darkness,

41:48.660 --> 41:51.780
or even the fear of embarrassment,

41:51.780 --> 41:53.340
but it is there.

41:53.340 --> 41:55.440
And so what I want you to do is I want you

41:55.440 --> 41:57.960
to write on the story behind that fear.

41:57.960 --> 41:59.130
You guys get me?

41:59.130 --> 42:00.870
- [Students] Yes, sir.

42:00.870 --> 42:02.070
- Perfect!

42:02.070 --> 42:04.170
All right then, if you have any questions,

42:04.170 --> 42:05.220
please raise your hand.

42:05.220 --> 42:08.490
Otherwise, take out your
pens and your pencils,

42:08.490 --> 42:10.800
and let's start writing.

42:10.800 --> 42:13.650
Do not rush.

42:13.650 --> 42:15.040
Let's get it done, people.

42:18.082 --> 42:20.999
(melancholy music)

42:27.658 --> 42:30.241
(upbeat music)

42:45.810 --> 42:46.643
- Hey, Jeremy.

42:46.643 --> 42:47.476
- Hey.

43:18.450 --> 43:19.833
Hey, where's Tyler?

43:27.720 --> 43:28.830
- Hey Jeremy.

43:28.830 --> 43:29.880
- Hey Jason!

43:29.880 --> 43:31.380
Nice costume, man.

43:31.380 --> 43:32.213
- Yeah, thanks man.

43:32.213 --> 43:33.046
You too!

43:33.046 --> 43:34.910
I don't see your toast?

43:34.910 --> 43:37.540
- Yeah, I haven't found him yet.

43:37.540 --> 43:38.763
- Alright, well,

43:39.900 --> 43:42.033
alright man, enjoy the party.

43:43.140 --> 43:44.910
Look at this as your own house.

43:44.910 --> 43:46.443
Not my words, Tyler's.

43:47.430 --> 43:49.683
- Okay.
- See you, bro.

44:18.412 --> 44:20.995
(upbeat music)

44:26.737 --> 44:28.593
- You got this, Jeremy.

44:28.593 --> 44:30.420
You got it, just go over there.

44:30.420 --> 44:33.903
Just say hey, how you doing?

44:36.540 --> 44:37.803
Just do it, come on.

44:44.567 --> 44:45.400
Hey.

44:46.864 --> 44:48.990
Looks like I found my toast.

44:48.990 --> 44:50.100
- Don't get me started.

44:50.100 --> 44:52.512
This is my sister's, and it sucks.

44:52.512 --> 44:54.453
I wish this party would just end.

44:55.371 --> 44:58.050
- Hey, the party's not that bad.

44:58.050 --> 45:00.872
They've got beer, they've got music.

45:00.872 --> 45:02.972
- And there's Sheila and Tyler making out.

45:06.210 --> 45:08.341
- So that's where he's been all this time.

45:08.341 --> 45:10.590
- Like why can't they just
do all of that in the room?

45:10.590 --> 45:12.003
- Tell me about it.

45:13.290 --> 45:15.030
- And that's why I hate parties.

45:15.030 --> 45:16.863
Especially costume parties.

45:17.730 --> 45:19.890
- You know, the party's not that bad!

45:19.890 --> 45:20.723
I mean, sure,

45:20.723 --> 45:22.170
they're over there feeding
on each others faces,

45:22.170 --> 45:25.533
but that's only because they've
been going out for a while.

45:27.180 --> 45:29.460
- So we have a Tyler fan here, huh?

45:29.460 --> 45:30.570
- Okay, whoa.

45:30.570 --> 45:32.643
No, he's just my best friend.

45:34.590 --> 45:36.450
Okay, this party does suck.

45:36.450 --> 45:39.463
- Yeah.
(giggles quickly)

45:43.720 --> 45:45.553
- So what's your name?

45:47.317 --> 45:49.410
- You know, I'm actually
not that comfortable

45:49.410 --> 45:52.170
saying my name to a complete stranger.

45:52.170 --> 45:53.850
- A stranger?

45:53.850 --> 45:56.610
I think we shared more than 100 words,

45:56.610 --> 45:59.400
which, yeah,

45:59.400 --> 46:00.993
that makes us not strangers.

46:02.940 --> 46:03.933
- It's Jules.

46:05.970 --> 46:07.320
- Nice to meet you, Jules.

46:07.320 --> 46:08.820
I'm Jeremy.

46:08.820 --> 46:10.370
- Nice to meet you too, Jeremy.

46:17.183 --> 46:19.023
- I'm sorry, I didn't.

46:20.190 --> 46:21.907
I leaned in, you just got.

46:28.431 --> 46:31.264
So do you know where the room is?

46:33.562 --> 46:34.979
- Actually, I do.

46:41.967 --> 46:44.634
(calming music)

47:25.163 --> 47:27.413
- Damn, that was something.

47:29.150 --> 47:30.400
- Yeah, it was.

47:33.698 --> 47:34.998
- Can I tell you a secret?

47:36.480 --> 47:37.730
- If you trust me enough?

47:42.750 --> 47:46.680
- This was actually my first time.

47:46.680 --> 47:47.633
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

47:57.060 --> 47:58.353
What's wrong?

47:59.542 --> 48:01.080
- I gotta get home.

48:01.080 --> 48:03.360
My mom's gonna kill me
if I come home late.

48:03.360 --> 48:05.220
- Okay, can I take you home then?

48:05.220 --> 48:06.630
- No, it's all good!

48:06.630 --> 48:08.010
Thanks though.

48:08.010 --> 48:09.513
- Jules, hey?

48:10.560 --> 48:12.030
It's dark out,

48:12.030 --> 48:13.110
and there's a bunch of drunk

48:13.110 --> 48:15.109
lunatics with fruit costumes on.

48:15.109 --> 48:18.359
(Jules laughs quickly)

48:20.430 --> 48:22.793
Look, I just wanna make sure
that you make it home safe.

48:26.220 --> 48:27.053
- Okay.

48:43.890 --> 48:45.803
- You think it's too late
to go trick or treating?

48:49.680 --> 48:51.870
Oh, I know this great pizza
place round the corner.

48:51.870 --> 48:53.880
You know, maybe I could
take you out sometime?

48:53.880 --> 48:54.807
We could hang out.

48:54.807 --> 48:58.143
- Hey Jeremy, there's something
I probably should tell you.

48:59.220 --> 49:00.053
- What is it?

49:02.190 --> 49:03.980
- So the thing is...

49:05.580 --> 49:06.483
I'm gay,

49:07.830 --> 49:10.080
and I know I probably should
have told you that before,

49:10.080 --> 49:12.603
but I think I just figured it out.

49:17.190 --> 49:18.330
- Was I that bad?

49:18.330 --> 49:19.740
- No, no,
no, no.

49:19.740 --> 49:20.583
It wasn't you.

49:23.430 --> 49:24.423
I'm sorry, Jeremy.

49:26.700 --> 49:28.713
I ruined your night and your first time.

49:30.399 --> 49:31.232
Stupid.

49:41.318 --> 49:42.151
- No.

49:46.467 --> 49:49.025
(sighs quickly)

49:49.025 --> 49:50.192
No, it's okay.

49:51.657 --> 49:53.263
I'm just glad that you told me.

49:54.518 --> 49:55.351
- Really?

49:56.528 --> 49:57.361
- Yeah.

50:02.364 --> 50:06.303
I mean, not too many people
are open about how they feel,

50:07.260 --> 50:10.533
but I'm just glad that
you trust me with that.

50:13.320 --> 50:15.570
- I didn't think you'd
be this understanding.

50:18.142 --> 50:19.725
- And now you know.

50:21.302 --> 50:24.543
And it was good either way, so--

50:24.543 --> 50:26.543
- Oh, you are so stupid.

50:29.605 --> 50:32.438
(emotional music)

50:38.496 --> 50:41.430
(bell ringing loudly)

50:41.430 --> 50:43.230
- Alright everyone, keep your papers,

50:43.230 --> 50:45.210
but I expect your complete assignment

50:45.210 --> 50:46.713
by the end of next week, okay?

50:48.150 --> 50:49.850
Alright everyone, have a good day.

51:01.622 --> 51:04.955
(phone ringing quietly)

51:08.376 --> 51:09.627
- [Jules] (voicemail) It's Jules.

51:09.627 --> 51:12.710

Ethan?

Why do I even know where you live?

52:35.027 --> 52:35.860
Jesus man.

(Jeremy grunting loudly)

53:01.530 --> 53:02.363
Come on!

53:09.113 --> 53:10.893
You are home, Mr Miller.

53:19.189 --> 53:21.540
- [Ethan] No dad, no!

53:21.540 --> 53:22.940
- You better thank me later.

53:31.829 --> 53:34.412
(upbeat music)

54:01.620 --> 54:02.470
Yeah, you owe me.

54:04.470 --> 54:06.333
You know, I should be home right now,

54:07.515 --> 54:10.563
but here I am, taking care of your ass.

54:28.828 --> 54:30.003
- You're awake!

54:32.280 --> 54:33.930
- What are you doing in my house?

54:36.450 --> 54:37.830
(yells loudly) What are
you doing in my house?

54:37.830 --> 54:38.663
- Listen to me--

54:38.663 --> 54:40.172
- (yells) I asked you a question.

54:41.520 --> 54:42.353
What are you doing?

54:42.353 --> 54:43.186
- I dragged your ass home because you

54:43.186 --> 54:44.820
was passed out in an alley, okay?

54:48.660 --> 54:50.943
- I didn't need your help, man.

54:50.943 --> 54:52.260
I don't need anybody's help.

54:52.260 --> 54:53.400
- Okay fine, all right?

54:53.400 --> 54:54.420
I'll leave!

54:54.420 --> 54:55.410
Just stop this!

54:56.988 --> 54:59.738
(dramatic music)

55:02.265 --> 55:03.432
- You're dead.

55:11.125 --> 55:12.042
You're dead

55:15.253 --> 55:18.086
(emotional music)

56:12.553 --> 56:15.886
(Ethan coughing loudly)

56:19.900 --> 56:23.233
(Ethan sobbing quietly)

56:29.198 --> 56:30.948
- Hey, it's okay man.

56:33.306 --> 56:36.556
(Ethan sobbing loudly)

56:44.660 --> 56:46.260
- If you're done, you can leave.

56:48.788 --> 56:51.030
- You know, I could have
left you out there to die,

56:51.030 --> 56:53.310
but I didn't.

56:53.310 --> 56:54.420
- So?

56:54.420 --> 56:55.670
Think you did me a favor?

56:57.210 --> 56:58.710
What do you want from me, man?

57:00.270 --> 57:01.380
- Yo, I don't know what
your beef is with me--

57:01.380 --> 57:03.303
- You know what my beef is with you.

57:04.290 --> 57:05.400
- Look man, let me just help you.

57:05.400 --> 57:06.903
- Who have you ever helped?

57:08.550 --> 57:09.750
Exactly, nobody man.

57:09.750 --> 57:12.300
You think that seeing me
like this makes you brave?

57:14.010 --> 57:15.410
You're still a little bitch.

57:16.890 --> 57:17.723
- Ethan,

57:17.723 --> 57:19.710
you cannot keep living like this, man.

57:19.710 --> 57:21.490
- Now the coward's gonna
teach me how to live my life?

57:21.490 --> 57:22.540
Is that what this is?

57:23.790 --> 57:24.623
Get out, man.

57:25.650 --> 57:26.483
Leave!

57:32.040 --> 57:32.873
- Fine.

57:37.140 --> 57:38.700
You know what?

57:38.700 --> 57:42.633
I may be a coward, but
you're still a loser.

57:48.540 --> 57:49.373
- Yo, wait.

57:52.950 --> 57:53.850
You're right, man.

57:59.130 --> 57:59.963
I'm a loser.

58:01.860 --> 58:02.693
I need help.

58:06.090 --> 58:07.080
- I'm sorry, I didn't hear you,

58:07.080 --> 58:07.913
'cause sometimes it gets like loud--

58:07.913 --> 58:09.060
- I said I need help,

58:09.060 --> 58:09.893
man, please.

58:11.490 --> 58:13.260
- For the first time, Ethan,

58:13.260 --> 58:15.333
we're on the same page, man.

58:18.240 --> 58:20.846
- So how are you gonna help me, man?

58:20.846 --> 58:22.096
- I don't know.

58:23.010 --> 58:24.960
I mean, I'll figure out something.

58:24.960 --> 58:26.543
I mean, what are you gonna tell your dad?

58:28.260 --> 58:29.510
- I'll make something up.

58:31.965 --> 58:33.420
- Why don't you go pack some clothes,

58:33.420 --> 58:34.253
we'll go to my house.

58:34.253 --> 58:35.086
- Your house?

58:35.086 --> 58:35.919
No, no,
no man.

58:35.919 --> 58:37.383
I can't go to your house.

58:39.450 --> 58:40.980
- Fine, goodnight.

58:40.980 --> 58:42.230
- Alright, wait a minute.

58:45.810 --> 58:46.643
Alright.

58:49.080 --> 58:50.643

1:00:06.154 --> 1:00:07.987
- Finally, come on in!

1:00:09.659 --> 1:00:12.242
(upbeat music)

1:00:14.921 --> 1:00:16.004
- Yeah, yeah.

1:00:17.220 --> 1:00:18.632
Yep, that's right baby!

1:00:18.632 --> 1:00:19.530
(laughs quickly)

1:00:19.530 --> 1:00:21.210
Give me a sexier look.

1:00:21.210 --> 1:00:22.200
Sexier.

1:00:22.200 --> 1:00:23.033
Look a little to the right.

1:00:23.033 --> 1:00:24.870
Hold that right there.

1:00:24.870 --> 1:00:26.280
Ooh, that's perfect.

1:00:26.280 --> 1:00:27.420
Don't move.

1:00:27.420 --> 1:00:29.670
Ooh, hold that.

1:00:29.670 --> 1:00:30.961
There it is.

1:00:30.961 --> 1:00:31.794
Yes.

1:00:33.474 --> 1:00:36.333
I think that we are done for today, Maya.

1:00:40.003 --> 1:00:42.375
- [Maya] Excuse me.

1:00:42.375 --> 1:00:45.400
- Damn, you must be the new girl?

1:00:45.400 --> 1:00:47.610
- Yes, I'm Tiffany.

1:00:47.610 --> 1:00:48.712
- [Isaac] Hi Tiffany.

1:00:48.712 --> 1:00:49.545
- Hi.

1:00:49.545 --> 1:00:50.793
- It is nice to meet you.

1:00:52.300 --> 1:00:53.940
God, you are gorgeous.

1:00:53.940 --> 1:00:54.773
- Thank you.

1:00:54.773 --> 1:00:56.130
- Are you ready for the shoot?

1:00:56.130 --> 1:00:57.273
- Yeah.
- Awesome.

1:00:58.170 --> 1:00:59.970
Let's go in the room in
the back and get changed.

1:00:59.970 --> 1:01:01.020
The outfits are waiting for you, okay?

1:01:01.020 --> 1:01:03.303
- Okay, thanks.

1:01:06.810 --> 1:01:07.643
- Not bad.

1:01:20.226 --> 1:01:23.726
(Tiffany giggles quickly)

1:01:40.155 --> 1:01:40.988
- Um...

1:01:54.363 --> 1:01:55.363
- Oh my God.

1:01:57.535 --> 1:01:58.368
- Thanks.

1:02:00.807 --> 1:02:03.262
(camera clicking loudly)

1:02:03.262 --> 1:02:04.497
Um, sir?

1:02:04.497 --> 1:02:05.853
- Are you ready, Tiffany?

1:02:07.020 --> 1:02:08.613
I need you to be natural.

1:02:10.020 --> 1:02:11.673
Be sexy, okay?

1:02:13.830 --> 1:02:16.740
- It's just that I'm a little
uncomfortable in this outfit.

1:02:16.740 --> 1:02:18.990
And I was wondering if maybe you could

1:02:18.990 --> 1:02:20.540
give me something else to wear?

1:02:21.790 --> 1:02:24.290
(tense music)

1:02:28.110 --> 1:02:29.243
- Listen, girl.

1:02:30.690 --> 1:02:33.390
There's absolutely nothing
to worry about, okay?

1:02:33.390 --> 1:02:35.340
I'm the best at what I do.

1:02:35.340 --> 1:02:38.040
Most people are shy at first,
but they get used to it.

1:02:42.240 --> 1:02:43.983
Trust me, okay?

1:02:47.250 --> 1:02:48.083
- Okay.

1:02:55.668 --> 1:02:56.501
- Rachel?

1:03:00.576 --> 1:03:01.409
Rachel!

1:03:02.520 --> 1:03:03.840
Hi.

1:03:03.840 --> 1:03:06.360
Will you please adjust her outfit

1:03:06.360 --> 1:03:07.863
just the way that I like it?

1:03:17.540 --> 1:03:20.123
- You shouldn't have come here.

1:03:22.230 --> 1:03:24.303
- Thank you, thank you.

1:03:32.637 --> 1:03:35.253
You still seem a little nervous.

1:03:38.370 --> 1:03:40.043
Why don't I help you relax a bit?

1:03:50.001 --> 1:03:50.834
- Ethan?

1:03:54.120 --> 1:03:55.120
I got you some food.

1:03:58.957 --> 1:04:01.053
- I don't want food, man.

1:04:02.970 --> 1:04:04.830
- Yeah, but if you don't eat,

1:04:04.830 --> 1:04:05.730
you will--

1:04:05.730 --> 1:04:07.890
- I need drugs, man.

1:04:07.890 --> 1:04:08.963
I need drugs.

1:04:09.805 --> 1:04:13.090
(tense music)

1:04:13.090 --> 1:04:16.507
(Jeremy coughing loudly)

1:04:19.424 --> 1:04:21.012
- Ethan, Ethan,
Ethan.

1:04:21.012 --> 1:04:21.845
Hey, Ethan?

1:04:23.041 --> 1:04:26.374
(Ethan coughing loudly)

1:04:31.874 --> 1:04:34.374
(eerie music)

1:05:03.240 --> 1:05:04.230
- [Ethan] Hey.

1:05:04.230 --> 1:05:05.063
- Hey.

1:05:08.460 --> 1:05:09.560
- What happened to me?

1:05:12.030 --> 1:05:13.430
- You were really messed up.

1:05:15.540 --> 1:05:16.540
- How'd you stop me?

1:05:17.460 --> 1:05:20.793
- I didn't, I just left you.

1:05:21.930 --> 1:05:24.693
I had no idea what to actually do, so.

1:05:25.530 --> 1:05:26.363
- Obviously.

1:05:27.783 --> 1:05:29.073
- Man, I won't lie.

1:05:29.910 --> 1:05:30.753
I got scared.

1:05:31.630 --> 1:05:32.523
- Yeah, yeah.

1:05:34.770 --> 1:05:36.409
I'm sorry man.

1:05:36.409 --> 1:05:38.763
- Nah, it's okay.

1:05:39.870 --> 1:05:42.270
I know how hard it must be for you,

1:05:42.270 --> 1:05:44.283
but trust me, you're doing better.

1:05:47.730 --> 1:05:48.573
You hungry?

1:05:50.340 --> 1:05:51.190
- A little, yeah.

1:05:52.950 --> 1:05:56.327
- I got some leftover
spaghetti that my mom cooked.

1:05:58.983 --> 1:06:01.816
(emotional music)

1:06:13.954 --> 1:06:17.454
(doorbell ringing loudly)

1:06:19.980 --> 1:06:20.813
- Jules?

1:06:20.813 --> 1:06:22.173
- Hey Alex, what's up?

1:06:28.440 --> 1:06:32.850
- My cousin's here, so I
was hanging out with her.

1:06:32.850 --> 1:06:34.320
What are you doing here?

1:06:34.320 --> 1:06:39.240
- Oh, I just thought maybe
you and I could go out.

1:06:39.240 --> 1:06:41.253
- I'm so sorry, but I can't.

1:06:43.530 --> 1:06:44.880
- You know what, it's okay.

1:06:46.110 --> 1:06:46.943
- Are you sure?

1:06:47.880 --> 1:06:50.493
- Yeah, I should have called you before.

1:06:51.690 --> 1:06:53.310
Oh, these are for you by the way.

1:06:53.310 --> 1:06:54.360
I hope you like them.

1:06:56.610 --> 1:06:59.730
- I'm sorry Jules, but whatever this is,

1:06:59.730 --> 1:07:01.620
I can't accept it.

1:07:01.620 --> 1:07:02.940
I know you came here to hang out,

1:07:02.940 --> 1:07:06.453
but I already love someone.

1:07:07.410 --> 1:07:10.533
I'm sorry, but I just
can't accept this from you.

1:07:12.150 --> 1:07:15.270
But I think of you as
a really good friend,

1:07:15.270 --> 1:07:18.093
so hopefully we can
continue with that, hmm?

1:07:19.860 --> 1:07:20.693
- Okay.

1:07:22.050 --> 1:07:26.100
Yeah, sorry to distribute you.

1:07:26.100 --> 1:07:27.033
Goodnight, Alexis.

1:07:32.417 --> 1:07:35.250
(sad piano music)

1:08:02.460 --> 1:08:05.610
Gosh, why am I being so open?

1:08:05.610 --> 1:08:07.114
Is it the beer?

1:08:07.114 --> 1:08:09.960
- Nah, I don't think it's the beer.

1:08:09.960 --> 1:08:14.400
I mean, we're friends.

1:08:14.400 --> 1:08:17.310
I just think you trust
me enough to talk to me.

1:08:17.310 --> 1:08:19.173
- Yeah, I guess you're right.

1:08:21.150 --> 1:08:23.433
- So your story?

1:08:25.020 --> 1:08:25.853
- Yeah.

1:08:26.760 --> 1:08:31.760
So it was about a year ago and
I was taking piano lessons.

1:08:33.630 --> 1:08:34.980
There were a lot of other kids there,

1:08:34.980 --> 1:08:37.080
but I was the only one with an extra hour.

1:08:38.790 --> 1:08:41.580
The dude taught me many tricks

1:08:41.580 --> 1:08:43.383
and tips to help me learn the piano.

1:08:47.340 --> 1:08:48.310
Then one day,

1:08:50.698 --> 1:08:52.281
he just touched me.

1:08:55.873 --> 1:08:58.823
I regret I didn't tell my
parents what happened after that.

1:09:02.568 --> 1:09:05.507
I just hate myself so much right now.

1:09:06.390 --> 1:09:08.990
If only I'd had the guts
to tell this to my parents.

1:09:10.770 --> 1:09:12.120
- What are you waiting for?

1:09:13.800 --> 1:09:15.600
They deserve to know more than I do.

1:09:16.477 --> 1:09:18.810
- But I'm scared, Jeremy.

1:09:18.810 --> 1:09:20.130
I'm scared that they'll abandon me

1:09:20.130 --> 1:09:22.103
because I'm not the
girl they thought I was.

1:09:24.344 --> 1:09:27.180
- You gotta give them a chance, Jules.

1:09:27.180 --> 1:09:28.143
I mean, at least.

1:09:29.850 --> 1:09:30.840
Sure, they'll be mad,

1:09:30.840 --> 1:09:32.343
but not because of you.

1:09:33.540 --> 1:09:34.383
- You think so?

1:09:35.730 --> 1:09:38.730
You think I should tell
my parents what happened?

1:09:38.730 --> 1:09:39.563
- Yeah.

1:09:41.580 --> 1:09:42.413
Trust me.

1:09:43.290 --> 1:09:44.240
You'll feel better,

1:09:45.109 --> 1:09:46.410
and what's the worst
thing they're gonna do?

1:09:46.410 --> 1:09:47.778
Throw pie in your face?

1:09:47.778 --> 1:09:52.778
- Oh, you're so stupid!

1:09:53.217 --> 1:09:54.837
But thanks, Jeremy.

1:09:54.837 --> 1:09:55.833
- Ah, no problem.

1:09:56.940 --> 1:09:59.303
I'm just glad you're
taking a wise man's advice.

1:10:00.270 --> 1:10:02.160
- Okay, now this is unfair.

1:10:02.160 --> 1:10:03.870
Now I feel like you have
something to blackmail me with,

1:10:03.870 --> 1:10:05.220
and I still don't have anything on you.

1:10:05.220 --> 1:10:07.195
- Well let's keep it that way, shall we?

1:10:07.195 --> 1:10:08.280
- Oh hell no!

1:10:08.280 --> 1:10:10.650
I opened up to you, it's
only right you do the same.

1:10:10.650 --> 1:10:12.480
- When did this ever become a rule?

1:10:12.480 --> 1:10:15.483
- Since tonight, and since
that time you kissed me.

1:10:18.360 --> 1:10:19.203
- Fair enough.

1:10:20.550 --> 1:10:21.503
- Well, what is it?

1:10:23.671 --> 1:10:25.643
- I just feel like
you're gonna laugh, but,

1:10:26.670 --> 1:10:29.093
you know you were the first
girl I ever flirted with?

1:10:30.720 --> 1:10:32.160
- Wait, what?

1:10:32.160 --> 1:10:34.010
Wait, are you being freaking serious?

1:10:35.250 --> 1:10:36.359
Huh.

1:10:36.359 --> 1:10:38.459
I thought you were like a literal Playboy.

1:10:40.470 --> 1:10:42.060
- Really?

1:10:42.060 --> 1:10:43.860
Were my lines that good?

1:10:43.860 --> 1:10:44.693
- Not really.

1:10:46.020 --> 1:10:48.750
You just seem like a natural.

1:10:48.750 --> 1:10:49.583
- Thanks.

1:10:51.150 --> 1:10:53.333
If only you didn't tell
me that you were gay,

1:10:54.360 --> 1:10:57.873
I'd kiss you again.
(laughs quietly)

1:11:02.610 --> 1:11:06.783
You know, I think this
makes us friends officially.

1:11:07.710 --> 1:11:10.680
- Boy, we were friends in
the moment we saw each other.

1:11:10.680 --> 1:11:12.480
- Oh, I like that.

1:11:12.480 --> 1:11:13.410
Okay, do you think we should get

1:11:13.410 --> 1:11:15.033
that on t-shirts and sell them?

1:11:15.987 --> 1:11:18.070
- Not a bad idea, friend.

1:11:24.057 --> 1:11:25.457
- You think we should leave?

1:11:27.360 --> 1:11:29.160
- No, I don't really want to go yet.

1:11:32.760 --> 1:11:34.310
Thanks Jeremy.

1:11:34.310 --> 1:11:35.143
- Yeah, no problem.

1:11:40.070 --> 1:11:43.653
(emotional acoustic music)

1:12:24.294 --> 1:12:26.425
- This is real drug, man.

1:12:26.425 --> 1:12:27.888
For real.

1:12:27.888 --> 1:12:31.305
- Yeah, everybody loves my mom's cooking.

1:12:32.160 --> 1:12:34.020
- Where are your parents?

1:12:34.020 --> 1:12:34.853
- In Vegas.

1:12:38.369 --> 1:12:39.619
You should, um,

1:12:42.177 --> 1:12:44.400
let your parents know you're here.

1:12:44.400 --> 1:12:46.443
I mean, they may be worried.

1:12:52.140 --> 1:12:53.690
- My dad doesn't care about me.

1:12:55.453 --> 1:12:56.943
- What about your mom?

1:12:57.870 --> 1:13:01.590
- She, uh.
(coughs quickly)

1:13:01.590 --> 1:13:02.890
She died a few years back.

1:13:09.450 --> 1:13:10.300
- I'm sorry, man.

1:13:17.970 --> 1:13:21.230
- Ever since then, my
dad hasn't been the same.

1:13:23.324 --> 1:13:25.324
I haven't been the same.

1:13:30.679 --> 1:13:32.929
But dad literally hates me.

1:13:34.913 --> 1:13:36.723
- I don't think he does.

1:13:39.785 --> 1:13:41.735
He may just have a weird
way of showing he loves you,

1:13:41.735 --> 1:13:45.012
but I don't think he hates you.

1:13:45.012 --> 1:13:45.845
- Yeah, he does.

1:13:47.204 --> 1:13:48.037
Trust me.

1:13:51.078 --> 1:13:52.328
You know why I hated you?

1:13:53.940 --> 1:13:57.120
Ever since my mom died,
Tiffany and I got really close.

1:13:57.120 --> 1:13:59.270
Her dad left her mom
around the same times.

1:14:00.480 --> 1:14:02.723
We became each other's
shoulder than lean on.

1:14:04.380 --> 1:14:07.793
That's why I hated you,
'cause I blamed you.

1:14:08.910 --> 1:14:11.843
I blamed you for taking away
the only reason I had to live.

1:14:14.247 --> 1:14:15.513
- I'm sorry, man.

1:14:16.620 --> 1:14:17.613
I didn't know.

1:14:18.631 --> 1:14:20.880
- It's over, you know?

1:14:20.880 --> 1:14:21.930
I gotta deal with it.

1:14:24.840 --> 1:14:26.760
It's funny how life works,

1:14:26.760 --> 1:14:29.010
'cause now you're the only
one that's willing to help me.

1:14:29.860 --> 1:14:31.110
- Yeah, I know,

1:14:34.743 --> 1:14:36.943
and you're the reason
why Tiffany dumped me.

1:14:39.030 --> 1:14:39.914
- For real?

1:14:39.914 --> 1:14:41.670
(Ethan and Jeremy laughing quickly)

1:14:41.670 --> 1:14:42.620
I guess we're even.

1:14:43.488 --> 1:14:44.340
- Yeah, we're even.

1:14:44.340 --> 1:14:45.750
- Good riddance to us.

1:14:45.750 --> 1:14:47.130
God, when she got mad?

1:14:47.130 --> 1:14:48.870
She's gnarly--

1:14:48.870 --> 1:14:51.270
- Yeah she blew up, man.

1:14:51.270 --> 1:14:52.380
Should have seen her.

1:14:52.380 --> 1:14:53.421
- Jeremy!

1:14:53.421 --> 1:14:55.893
Get up here and stand up for me!

1:14:57.782 --> 1:15:00.532
(laughs quickly)

1:15:06.346 --> 1:15:07.679
Wait, wait,
wait.

1:15:09.512 --> 1:15:11.070
Shortcut, shortcut.

1:15:11.070 --> 1:15:11.903
Get knowledge.

1:15:13.142 --> 1:15:15.480
(door knocking quietly)

1:15:15.480 --> 1:15:16.313
- Who's that?

1:15:16.313 --> 1:15:17.918
- I don't know, go answer it.

1:15:17.918 --> 1:15:19.710
(door knocking quietly)

1:15:19.710 --> 1:15:21.660
- Oh, you better not
let Wave Chappelle win.

1:15:26.850 --> 1:15:28.150
- Where the hell's my son?

1:15:29.548 --> 1:15:32.715
(yells) Ethan, Ethan?

1:15:33.917 --> 1:15:34.750
Ethan!

1:15:35.946 --> 1:15:37.950
Where's my son?

1:15:37.950 --> 1:15:38.910
- Ethan isn't here.

1:15:38.910 --> 1:15:39.920
- Tell me where my son is right now,

1:15:39.920 --> 1:15:42.270
or I will call the cops and
put you behind bars so quick.

1:15:42.270 --> 1:15:44.181
You have no idea the connections I have.

1:15:44.181 --> 1:15:45.014
Ethan?

1:15:45.014 --> 1:15:45.847
- With all due respect, sir,

1:15:45.847 --> 1:15:47.677
Ethan isn't here, I
don't know where he is--

1:15:47.677 --> 1:15:49.830
- Don't lie to me, kid.

1:15:49.830 --> 1:15:52.530
My neighbor saw you with
him a couple of days ago.

1:15:52.530 --> 1:15:54.690
You tell me where he's at right now.

1:15:54.690 --> 1:15:56.456
Enough of this camp bullshit.

1:15:56.456 --> 1:15:57.570
Ethan?

1:15:57.570 --> 1:15:58.403
- Dad.

1:16:00.240 --> 1:16:02.553
- Ethan, when did you get here?

1:16:08.820 --> 1:16:11.181
- What are you doing here?

1:16:11.181 --> 1:16:13.650
- What am I doing here?

1:16:13.650 --> 1:16:15.810
The question is what are
you doing here, Ethan?

1:16:15.810 --> 1:16:19.350
- I came to hang with my
friend Jeremy for a few days.

1:16:19.350 --> 1:16:21.030
- Seriously, him?

1:16:21.030 --> 1:16:22.233
- Yeah dad, my friend.

1:16:23.730 --> 1:16:25.350
- Okay guys, look.

1:16:25.350 --> 1:16:27.210
Let's take it slow and steady.

1:16:27.210 --> 1:16:28.043
Mr Miller--

1:16:28.043 --> 1:16:28.876
- Get out of here.

1:16:28.876 --> 1:16:31.110
- What the hell, relax!

1:16:31.110 --> 1:16:32.850
- This is enough, Ethan.

1:16:32.850 --> 1:16:34.200
We're going home right now.

1:16:35.854 --> 1:16:36.954
- I'm not coming home.

1:16:39.090 --> 1:16:40.500
- What did you say to me?

1:16:40.500 --> 1:16:42.210
- Okay, look,
look.

1:16:42.210 --> 1:16:44.360
Come on, we can just talk about this.

1:16:44.360 --> 1:16:45.323
- [Tim] What did I tell you--

1:16:45.323 --> 1:16:46.323
- Dad, stop!

1:16:49.355 --> 1:16:50.355
You alright?

1:16:52.993 --> 1:16:54.030
- Mr Miller.

1:16:54.030 --> 1:16:56.310
Your son is a good kid, alright?

1:16:56.310 --> 1:16:57.710
He deserves better than you.

1:16:59.353 --> 1:17:01.603
- Enough, we're going home.

1:17:03.070 --> 1:17:05.973
- No dad, I'm not coming home with you.

1:17:06.932 --> 1:17:07.765
- What did you say?

1:17:08.907 --> 1:17:10.863
- I'm tired of living under your abuse.

1:17:13.860 --> 1:17:14.910
- What did you do to my son?

1:17:14.910 --> 1:17:16.950
- Dad, I'm done living my life

1:17:16.950 --> 1:17:19.110
like an addict who's got
nothing better to do.

1:17:19.110 --> 1:17:21.010
And Jeremy's done nothing but help me.

1:17:23.850 --> 1:17:26.130
- You think you're better than me?

1:17:26.130 --> 1:17:27.980
But you know what?

1:17:27.980 --> 1:17:30.507
You're the biggest
disappointment in my life.

1:17:30.507 --> 1:17:31.340
- Oh yeah?

1:17:31.340 --> 1:17:32.283
Well, I come from you.

1:17:35.314 --> 1:17:37.757
- One more word and you're dead.

1:17:39.570 --> 1:17:41.569
- You think I'm afraid of you?

1:17:41.569 --> 1:17:43.077
I'm not scared of you anymore, dad.

1:17:43.077 --> 1:17:44.994
You can't control me, you
can't even control yourself.

1:17:44.994 --> 1:17:45.994
Look at you.

1:17:47.169 --> 1:17:48.519
- (yells loudly) Mr Miller!

1:17:51.960 --> 1:17:53.013
Mr Miller, stop!

1:17:54.274 --> 1:17:56.572
- Get off me, get off me!

1:17:56.572 --> 1:17:59.322
(dramatic music)

1:18:02.831 --> 1:18:04.081
Son of a bitch.

1:18:05.756 --> 1:18:06.589
- Stop!

1:18:15.456 --> 1:18:17.039
- Alright, come on.

1:18:25.458 --> 1:18:26.458
- Hey, wait.

1:18:27.642 --> 1:18:29.475
Whoa, whoa,
whoa, wait.

1:18:35.741 --> 1:18:36.991
- Oh no, oh no.

1:18:42.312 --> 1:18:45.562
(vase smashing loudly)

1:18:52.657 --> 1:18:54.573
- I'm gonna go get some rest.

1:18:55.680 --> 1:18:56.980
I suggest you do the same.

1:19:06.600 --> 1:19:07.433
Oh, hey.

1:19:08.520 --> 1:19:09.570
Call the cops for me?

1:19:11.381 --> 1:19:12.431
And an ambulance too?

1:19:15.507 --> 1:19:17.670
- What are you gonna tell the cops?

1:19:19.470 --> 1:19:20.433
- Self defense.

1:19:26.160 --> 1:19:28.623
- Sometimes you gotta stand up and fight.

1:19:31.170 --> 1:19:33.090
You gotta face your fears,

1:19:33.090 --> 1:19:35.130
and tell it that you're done worrying,

1:19:35.130 --> 1:19:37.018
you're done hiding,

1:19:37.018 --> 1:19:40.473
and show the world who you
really are behind that fear.

1:19:42.630 --> 1:19:44.133
And once you do that?

1:19:46.710 --> 1:19:47.973
The world becomes,

1:19:48.810 --> 1:19:50.583
it becomes much more different.

1:19:52.892 --> 1:19:54.183
And it becomes livable,

1:19:55.650 --> 1:19:57.855
enjoyable, and you can,

1:19:57.855 --> 1:19:59.823
(sighs loudly) you can just breathe.

1:20:01.860 --> 1:20:03.870
Now, this is nothing that I'm just

1:20:03.870 --> 1:20:08.486
speaking randomly or anything like that.

1:20:08.486 --> 1:20:10.319
It's just, I lived it,

1:20:11.760 --> 1:20:13.203
and I realized that fear?

1:20:14.580 --> 1:20:16.477
It's nothing that to be afraid of.

1:20:27.739 --> 1:20:30.083
- [Yoga Instructor] And arms
lengthening down by your side.

1:20:30.083 --> 1:20:31.022
On breath in, reach your arms--

1:20:31.022 --> 1:20:32.095
- [Jules] Hey, mom?

1:20:32.095 --> 1:20:34.294
- [Angie] Hey, sweetheart.

1:20:34.294 --> 1:20:35.945
- Can we talk?

1:20:35.945 --> 1:20:38.862
(triumphant music)

1:20:44.551 --> 1:20:45.468
- You okay?

1:21:15.390 --> 1:21:16.691
- Ethan!

1:21:16.691 --> 1:21:18.240
- Do I have to do this?

1:21:18.240 --> 1:21:19.350
- Yes.

1:21:19.350 --> 1:21:21.157
Trust me, this is better
than DIY treatment.

1:21:21.157 --> 1:21:22.470
- Yeah, but I'm clean.

1:21:22.470 --> 1:21:23.610
I'm good.

1:21:23.610 --> 1:21:24.840
- Ethan, if you really wanna get better,

1:21:24.840 --> 1:21:27.633
this is the right way and
only choice that you have.

1:21:31.448 --> 1:21:33.423
- Alright, alright.

1:21:35.888 --> 1:21:38.160
(upbeat music)

1:21:38.160 --> 1:21:39.240
- Hi, how can I help you?

1:21:39.240 --> 1:21:42.457
- Hey, my friend here wants to get clean,

1:21:45.013 --> 1:21:46.920
so can you tell us about the programs

1:21:46.920 --> 1:21:47.820
that you guys have please?

1:21:47.820 --> 1:21:48.653
- Of course!

1:21:48.653 --> 1:21:50.250
Follow me and I'll take
you to the counselor.

1:21:50.250 --> 1:21:52.590
He'll help you decide which
programs are best for you.

1:21:52.590 --> 1:21:53.580
Right this way.

1:21:53.580 --> 1:21:54.903
- Alright, let's go.

1:22:04.740 --> 1:22:05.573
One.

1:22:06.600 --> 1:22:07.433
Two.

1:22:07.433 --> 1:22:08.610
- Man, shut up.

1:22:08.610 --> 1:22:10.747
You're worse than my pops.

1:22:10.747 --> 1:22:13.330
(upbeat music)

1:22:15.642 --> 1:22:18.975
(door knocking quietly)

1:22:20.755 --> 1:22:21.588
- Tiff?

1:22:24.598 --> 1:22:27.180
What are you doing here?

1:22:27.180 --> 1:22:29.340
- I just came to apologize,

1:22:29.340 --> 1:22:32.290
because I know that I was harsh
and I know that I hurt you.

1:22:33.353 --> 1:22:37.410
Can you please accept my apology?

1:22:37.410 --> 1:22:40.110
- What's going on, is everything okay?

1:22:40.110 --> 1:22:42.543
- No, nothing's right.

1:22:43.440 --> 1:22:45.190
Everything's kind of falling apart.

1:22:50.880 --> 1:22:52.580
- Wanna go for a walk in the park?

1:22:54.111 --> 1:22:59.111
- Yeah.

1:23:10.108 --> 1:23:13.888
Please say something.

1:23:13.888 --> 1:23:18.349
- What do you want me to say, Tiff?

1:23:18.349 --> 1:23:20.782
Look, I'm sorry about
what happened to you,

1:23:20.782 --> 1:23:23.104
but why are you telling me this?

1:23:23.104 --> 1:23:25.710
- Because there's nobody I can talk to.

1:23:25.710 --> 1:23:28.140
- Tiffany, everyone loves you!

1:23:28.140 --> 1:23:29.877
I'm pretty sure you can,

1:23:29.877 --> 1:23:31.485
you got plenty of friends to talk to--

1:23:31.485 --> 1:23:33.435
- Yeah, but there's nobody I can trust.

1:23:34.380 --> 1:23:35.880
- Tiff.
(sighs loudly)

1:23:35.880 --> 1:23:37.680
- Look, I know I acted selfishly,

1:23:37.680 --> 1:23:39.630
but can you please just
give me another chance?

1:23:39.630 --> 1:23:40.620
I promise that.

1:23:40.620 --> 1:23:41.807
- No Tiff, stop.

1:23:41.807 --> 1:23:42.640
- [Tiffany] I promise that I won't--

1:23:42.640 --> 1:23:43.473
- Stop!

1:23:48.102 --> 1:23:50.606
(Jeremy sighing loudly)

1:23:50.606 --> 1:23:52.303
Look, the thing is,

1:23:55.470 --> 1:23:57.220
even if I wanted to date you again,

1:23:58.620 --> 1:23:59.745
I don't think that we should.

1:23:59.745 --> 1:24:01.380
- Why?

1:24:01.380 --> 1:24:02.400
- Because.

1:24:02.400 --> 1:24:03.810
- Because you already love somebody else?

1:24:03.810 --> 1:24:05.370
- No, it's nothing like that.

1:24:05.370 --> 1:24:09.303
It's just I think that we just
end up hurting each other.

1:24:10.979 --> 1:24:12.150
- Look, I promise.

1:24:12.150 --> 1:24:13.890
I promise I will never hurt you again.

1:24:13.890 --> 1:24:15.693
- Tiffany, you can't promise that.

1:24:26.579 --> 1:24:27.690
Look.

1:24:27.690 --> 1:24:28.523
Look at me, Tiffany.

1:24:28.523 --> 1:24:29.356
- No.

1:24:36.860 --> 1:24:40.683
If you ever need me, you know
I'll always be there for you.

1:24:43.249 --> 1:24:45.740
Alright, but I think you should just

1:24:45.740 --> 1:24:47.518
go and tell your mom about what happened.

(Jeremy laughs quietly)

1:25:44.602 --> 1:25:46.602
So how have things been?

1:25:48.672 --> 1:25:50.940
- Hey, why do I feel like it's been

1:25:50.940 --> 1:25:52.950
a long time since we last talked?

1:25:52.950 --> 1:25:54.400
- Because it has been, silly.

1:25:56.880 --> 1:25:58.370
- Jules, I'm sorry.

1:26:00.636 --> 1:26:01.469
You forgive me?

1:26:04.050 --> 1:26:04.883
- Never.

1:26:04.883 --> 1:26:07.618
(giggles loudly)

1:26:08.490 --> 1:26:10.710
Okay, what is up with
you and Ethan by the way?

1:26:10.710 --> 1:26:12.870
People are saying you beat up his dad.

1:26:12.870 --> 1:26:15.540
- Ethan's actually a good guy.

1:26:15.540 --> 1:26:19.173
I've been helping him out
with a few of his issues.

1:26:23.100 --> 1:26:25.143
- You know what'd be so good right now?

1:26:26.730 --> 1:26:27.690
- What?

1:26:27.690 --> 1:26:30.810
- Well, there's this pizza
place not too far from my house.

1:26:30.810 --> 1:26:32.583
Maybe you and I should go sometime.

1:26:34.470 --> 1:26:36.180
- Like tonight?

1:26:36.180 --> 1:26:37.013
- Well, if we rush,

1:26:37.013 --> 1:26:38.400
we can get there before they close.

1:26:38.400 --> 1:26:39.993
- Seriously?

1:26:43.170 --> 1:26:44.853
Are you sure, Jules?

1:26:46.260 --> 1:26:47.400
- Jeez, Jeremy,

1:26:47.400 --> 1:26:48.723
you are terrible at this.

1:26:51.060 --> 1:26:54.030
- Let's go before they actually close.

1:26:54.030 --> 1:26:56.613
(upbeat music)

1:26:57.893 --> 1:27:00.960
You know, I knew you was
gonna come around eventually.

1:27:00.960 --> 1:27:01.908
- Yeah, me too.

1:27:01.908 --> 1:27:04.080
I don't know what it was though.

1:27:04.080 --> 1:27:05.340
- It was my swag!

1:27:05.340 --> 1:27:06.750
Jeremy got a lot of it.

1:27:06.750 --> 1:27:07.583
- No, no,
no, no.

1:27:07.583 --> 1:27:08.421
That's not it.

1:27:08.421 --> 1:27:10.659
I think it was the um

1:27:10.659 --> 1:27:11.733
That avocado costume

1:27:11.733 --> 1:27:14.387
- Shut up!
