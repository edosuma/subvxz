WEBVTT

00:01.543 --> 00:03.712
Phil Esterhaus passed away this morning.

00:03.795 --> 00:06.589
NARRATOR:
<i>Previously on</i> Hill Street Blues...

00:07.674 --> 00:10.760
Leo, I got a couple of enterprising
young TV thieves here for you.

00:10.844 --> 00:12.303
About those two misguided youths.

00:12.387 --> 00:14.305
Maybe we can do some business here.

00:14.389 --> 00:17.267
I have to make myself
understand why it happened.

00:17.350 --> 00:20.228
If he had bashed my face in
or slashed my throat,

00:20.311 --> 00:22.939
would that make you feel better?
Would that help you understand?

00:23.023 --> 00:24.649
Me, take the sergeant's place?

00:24.733 --> 00:25.608
I recommended you.

00:25.692 --> 00:27.068
To the sarge.

00:27.152 --> 00:29.571
We loved him. We gonna miss him.

00:30.071 --> 00:30.947
God bless him.

00:33.408 --> 00:37.120
Item six, February thaw.
Anticipating a bump in sidewalk crime.

00:37.203 --> 00:41.041
Mick Belker goes undercover this a.m.
at Rosswall and 113th.

00:41.124 --> 00:42.667
Pilsky and Peyser as backup.

00:42.751 --> 00:44.919
This is the action corner
for three-card Monte scams

00:45.003 --> 00:49.549
and a group of pickpockets
known as the Funk Family Robinson

00:49.841 --> 00:51.885
whose shill is breakdancing.

00:51.968 --> 00:54.471
Item seven,
scorecard on Judge Cruz's court order

00:54.554 --> 00:56.681
easing overcrowding
at the Michigan Avenue facility

00:56.765 --> 00:58.183
at the 24-hour mark.

00:58.683 --> 01:01.227
Of 247 inmates released OR,

01:01.311 --> 01:06.107
18 have been re-arrested on fresh charges,
30 more missed their court dates yesterday

01:06.191 --> 01:08.735
and are subject to arrest
on bench warrants.

01:08.818 --> 01:10.361
Great idea, Judge.

01:11.196 --> 01:15.325
Item eight, our ring of truck hijackers
continues to elude capture

01:15.408 --> 01:17.952
and the Zucchini Bandit
is still circulating.

01:18.411 --> 01:21.206
Male, white, heavy set,
early 30s, balding.

01:21.289 --> 01:23.333
Six reports in the last few days

01:23.416 --> 01:25.210
with two of the victims
reporting that what passed

01:25.293 --> 01:28.171
for a concealed gun
turned out to be a squash

01:28.254 --> 01:30.715
tossed in their puss when the robbery
had been completed.

01:31.174 --> 01:33.093
-Let's nail him.
-Let's bread him.

01:36.387 --> 01:38.181
Babs, would you tell the Captain
we're almost through?

01:39.015 --> 01:44.687
Item nine, during the last toll period,
this precinct shows 213 calls

01:44.771 --> 01:47.524
to the prerecorded message known
as Dial a Nymph.

01:48.149 --> 01:52.612
Please, desist from wasting more
city money on such X-rated calls.

01:53.071 --> 01:56.032
Item ten, Captain tells me that

01:56.116 --> 01:58.785
funeral arrangements
for Sergeant Esterhaus is still pending.

01:58.868 --> 01:59.911
You'll be kept apprised.

01:59.994 --> 02:02.747
Uh, Lieutenant,
is there a family we can write to?

02:02.831 --> 02:05.041
Is there someplace
we can send our condolences?

02:05.125 --> 02:07.836
Apparently not. I guess we're
the only family the sergeant had.

02:07.919 --> 02:10.213
Captain has a final item for you.

02:14.175 --> 02:16.302
-Morning, folks.
-Morning, Captain.

02:16.386 --> 02:18.721
Among Sergeant Esterhaus' effects,

02:19.305 --> 02:20.682
was this letter addressed

02:20.765 --> 02:23.726
to the peace officers
of the Hill Street day shift.

02:26.187 --> 02:28.690
"Perhaps you thought you'd heard
the last from me,

02:29.440 --> 02:31.985
but I desired to turn you out
one last time

02:32.068 --> 02:34.279
before assuming the duties
of my new assignment.

02:35.029 --> 02:38.575
There I'm sure we'll all be
double-shifting together again.

02:38.867 --> 02:40.702
I hope not for a long time.

02:41.494 --> 02:45.331
Item one, the shedding of crocodile tears
is strictly prohibited.

02:45.999 --> 02:48.334
Hoist a shot or two if you must,

02:48.418 --> 02:50.920
I'll look the other way,
but not when you're on duty.

02:54.424 --> 02:57.427
Item two,
let us not forget in their bereavement

02:57.510 --> 02:59.637
the loved ones of our departed fellows.

03:00.138 --> 03:02.140
Look in on Grace once in a while,
my friends.

03:03.183 --> 03:04.225
Item three...

03:06.728 --> 03:08.688
remain my kind of cops.

03:10.648 --> 03:13.067
Find something of worth in each person.

03:13.651 --> 03:16.446
Something to care for in each situation.

03:18.323 --> 03:20.200
Dress neatly, speak politely.

03:21.492 --> 03:24.913
You have declared your faith in society.
Keep that faith.

03:25.496 --> 03:26.748
It will keep you.

03:28.666 --> 03:29.751
Item last,

03:31.252 --> 03:33.963
though the Hill is generally
considered the wastebasket

03:34.047 --> 03:35.882
of this city's law enforcement minions,

03:36.925 --> 03:39.761
I have found its denizens
to be the fairest,

03:40.470 --> 03:44.057
most courageous and hardworking
I've been privileged to know.

03:45.058 --> 03:46.309
Gentlemen and ladies,

03:46.893 --> 03:48.603
it has been a rare pleasure.

03:49.395 --> 03:51.105
Now pick your butts up and let's roll.

03:51.189 --> 03:54.484
And remember always,
let's be careful out there."

04:07.664 --> 04:10.083
(chattering)

04:15.880 --> 04:17.048
Man sure had a way with words.

04:17.131 --> 04:19.008
He was saying goodbye.
Don't give it a review.

04:19.092 --> 04:21.010
I'd like to see the numbnut
they bring in to replace him.

04:21.094 --> 04:22.720
Whole day's gonna stink now.

04:22.804 --> 04:25.807
-Nice friendly letter.
-Henry, homicide.

04:25.890 --> 04:27.642
State Assembly Leader Randazzo.

04:27.725 --> 04:29.644
-Killed somebody?
-Got killed.

04:31.813 --> 04:33.314
-Where's Leo?
-(growls)

04:33.398 --> 04:36.317
Here. I got bodily functions, too.

04:37.610 --> 04:39.988
-What's this?
-MAN: It's a misunderstanding.

04:40.071 --> 04:42.865
-I was going to the pawnshop.
-At 6:00 in the morning.

04:42.949 --> 04:44.909
Who's got a warped sense of humor?

04:44.993 --> 04:47.787
Leo, it's just evidence.
It came in with the perp.

04:47.870 --> 04:49.622
Is this humor?

04:50.164 --> 04:52.000
-Is this a general butt of jokes?
-Leo.

04:52.083 --> 04:54.961
Okay, my wife's cheating on me, all right?

04:55.378 --> 04:57.755
She's seeing a computer software man!

04:58.923 --> 05:01.217
There! Is everyone happy?

05:01.884 --> 05:04.095
My wife is stepping out!
(chuckles)

05:04.178 --> 05:06.597
Leo the cuckold! Leo the fool!

05:10.101 --> 05:12.937
WOMAN (on radio):
<i>Dispatch, we have a 9-11.</i>

05:13.021 --> 05:14.689
<i>Armed robbery in progress.</i>

05:14.772 --> 05:18.568
<i>See Surplus Store,</i>
<i>corner People's Drive and 124th street.</i>

05:18.651 --> 05:20.278
(sirens wailing)

05:25.742 --> 05:29.662
(theme music playing)

06:31.099 --> 06:33.976
(sirens blaring)

07:06.217 --> 07:07.135
Ah, Lieutenant.

07:08.845 --> 07:11.597
-Heavyweight.
-Assembly Leader Randazzo.

07:11.681 --> 07:15.601
Yeah, the gun's registered to him.
She says it discharged during a struggle.

07:15.685 --> 07:19.147
Don't they all? There's half a gram
of coke, some pills.

07:19.230 --> 07:21.941
Nobody else was around. She made the call.

07:22.024 --> 07:23.443
Let's try to hold the press off, okay?

07:23.526 --> 07:25.236
I don't think this one stays quiet,
Lieutenant.

07:25.319 --> 07:27.155
Maybe we buy an hour. What's her name?

07:27.238 --> 07:29.073
Whitney Barnes. Not Tiffany.

07:29.157 --> 07:30.658
-Not Kimberly.
-Got it.

07:43.504 --> 07:45.756
Lieutenant Goldblume, Ms. Barnes.

07:46.966 --> 07:49.218
The other guy already gave me my warnings.

07:51.512 --> 07:53.139
-This was an accident?
-Yes.

07:53.222 --> 07:56.100
I was struggling to get the gun
to protect myself

07:56.559 --> 07:58.644
and the-the dope is his.

08:00.563 --> 08:03.274
-Whose townhouse is this?
-A friend of mine.

08:04.942 --> 08:06.861
-Name?
-Lester.

08:07.612 --> 08:09.363
-(bag zipping)
-Lester who?

08:10.656 --> 08:15.161
Uh, Menley. Lester Menley.
He's my business manager.

08:18.414 --> 08:20.833
We'd like to get a statement from you
at the stationhouse.

08:21.375 --> 08:22.502
-Okay.
-MAN: Lieutenant.

08:22.585 --> 08:23.878
-Yes.
-MAN: Lieutenant.

08:24.587 --> 08:26.797
-Video camera.
-What?

08:27.048 --> 08:29.383
We found it behind a two-way mirror
in the bedroom.

08:30.635 --> 08:31.928
Blackmail, Whitney?

08:33.137 --> 08:35.515
I didn't know anything
about that, I swear.

08:37.141 --> 08:39.685
I'm not a blackmailer, Lieutenant.

08:40.436 --> 08:41.437
I'm not a killer.

08:42.939 --> 08:44.815
Okay. We better go.

08:57.995 --> 09:00.039
Frank, your messages.

09:00.623 --> 09:03.209
Mrs. Spencer
at Woolman's Brother's Mortuary

09:03.751 --> 09:05.336
has called three times.

09:05.795 --> 09:08.923
She has to know what you plan to do
with the cremains.

09:09.840 --> 09:11.509
-Cremains?
-Uh-huh.

09:13.010 --> 09:15.221
-I'll give her a call.
-All right.

09:18.057 --> 09:20.476
-Lieutenant Calletino?
-Calletano, yes.

09:20.560 --> 09:23.271
Right, don't look up.
Just go about your business.

09:25.022 --> 09:26.774
Al Desjardins, general accounting.

09:26.857 --> 09:28.276
-So?
-We have a problem here, Lieutenant.

09:28.359 --> 09:30.278
Office supply appropriations
for this precinct

09:30.361 --> 09:32.280
off the board relative
to department median.

09:32.363 --> 09:35.241
The computer flagged it,
and so I correlated some invoices.

09:35.324 --> 09:37.535
Legal pads, 36 percent over.

09:37.618 --> 09:39.412
Ballpoint pens, 25 percent over.

09:39.495 --> 09:41.998
-Three-ring binders, 18 percent--
-Why are you telling me this?

09:42.081 --> 09:43.666
We've got a petty thief
up here, Lieutenant.

09:43.749 --> 09:45.543
The computer kicked you out
as authorizing requisitioner.

09:45.626 --> 09:48.004
-Are you suggesting--
-There isn't a faintest shadow

09:48.087 --> 09:49.964
of a suspicion about you, Lieutenant.

09:50.047 --> 09:51.632
I just wanted to let you
know that I'm on the job

09:51.716 --> 09:53.384
and will bring this culprit to ground.

09:53.467 --> 09:56.053
-This is what you do?
-My cover is computer repair.

09:56.137 --> 09:58.472
I want you to not even
notice that I'm here, hm.

09:58.556 --> 09:59.849
-I'll manage.
-Thank you.

10:06.606 --> 10:08.566
Sorry I'm late, Sandy.
You been waiting long?

10:09.025 --> 10:11.777
-Not too bad.
-Look, did the DA talk to you yet?

10:11.861 --> 10:13.279
No, about what?

10:13.362 --> 10:15.364
-Ms. Valpariso?
-Morning.

10:15.448 --> 10:17.867
Do you understand the purpose
of this hearing thing?

10:18.909 --> 10:22.079
I know what kind of questions to expect.
I can handle it.

10:22.788 --> 10:26.542
The hearing is to determine charges.
There are two ways we can take your case.

10:26.626 --> 10:30.171
I'll be very straight with you about each.
You tell me which way you want to go.

10:30.630 --> 10:33.174
-Okay.
-All right, first we can charge rape.

10:33.257 --> 10:36.177
My sense is that given the factual setting

10:36.260 --> 10:39.263
our chances for conviction
are no better than 50-50.

10:39.347 --> 10:43.976
-No signs of struggle. No recovered--
-Right, no cuts or bruises.

10:44.060 --> 10:45.144
Fortunately.

10:45.853 --> 10:49.440
No recovered weapon.
Prior acquaintance with the accused.

10:49.523 --> 10:50.816
I don't know him.

10:51.484 --> 10:53.778
We once worked in the same place.

10:53.861 --> 10:57.406
Which, however tenuous
and ultimately irrelevant,

10:57.490 --> 10:59.617
makes rape a tougher sell.

11:00.159 --> 11:03.204
The second alternative, he has a history
of robberies and break-ins.

11:03.287 --> 11:06.290
We can get him to plead on that
and put him away for sure.

11:07.124 --> 11:08.167
For sure?

11:09.168 --> 11:12.380
He spent one night in jail
after his last robbery.

11:12.463 --> 11:14.298
And then he was out and he raped me.

11:14.382 --> 11:15.549
Hey, that won't happen again.

11:15.633 --> 11:18.386
He goes for three years
or we do not make a deal.

11:18.469 --> 11:20.513
And if we go to trial on the rape?

11:20.596 --> 11:24.600
-And win? Five to seven years.
-(sighs)

11:24.684 --> 11:28.354
-He's back out on the street in three max.
-(scoffs)

11:30.523 --> 11:32.108
So those are the choices?

11:32.983 --> 11:34.694
Those are the choices.

11:34.777 --> 11:37.405
I recommend we try
for a robbery conviction.

11:38.572 --> 11:40.616
But you tell me which way you want to go.

11:44.662 --> 11:47.665
JOYCE: At this time my client changes
his previously entered plea

11:47.748 --> 11:50.626
of not guilty to guilty
on the robbery only

11:50.710 --> 11:52.002
to cover all counts.

11:52.086 --> 11:53.504
Is that plea acceptable, Ms. Kennedy?

11:53.587 --> 11:56.298
It is, Your Honor,
with the further stipulation

11:56.382 --> 11:59.885
that Mr. Villa receive a minimum
three-year sentence.

11:59.969 --> 12:02.054
Ms. Valpariso,
do you understand these proceedings?

12:03.431 --> 12:05.099
-Yes.
-Do you have an objection?

12:07.309 --> 12:08.269
No.

12:10.271 --> 12:13.315
Your Honor,
could I just say something for the record?

12:13.399 --> 12:14.400
JUDGE: Go ahead.

12:16.235 --> 12:20.906
All of the detectives and Ms. Kennedy,
they've all been very good to me.

12:20.990 --> 12:22.032
And fair.

12:23.743 --> 12:25.786
And I know that this makes sense.

12:27.079 --> 12:28.914
But I'm just sick at heart, Your Honor.

12:30.124 --> 12:31.792
That when this man attacked me,

12:32.501 --> 12:35.212
I did exactly what everyone said to do.

12:36.672 --> 12:39.300
I submitted, Your Honor,
when this man had a knife.

12:40.468 --> 12:42.178
And because I did that...

12:46.098 --> 12:47.308
(scoffs)

12:47.391 --> 12:50.394
Never mind. It's okay.
I just want it to be done.

12:53.898 --> 12:55.107
So you called her?

12:55.608 --> 12:57.067
Yeah, before she went
to court this morning.

12:57.151 --> 12:59.361
-And?
-I'm gonna see her tonight.

12:59.445 --> 13:02.656
-Okay, I told you.
-It doesn't mean we made up.

13:03.532 --> 13:05.534
Right. You know, Sandy right now

13:05.618 --> 13:07.119
is going through as tough
a thing as any woman

13:07.203 --> 13:09.663
-ever has to go through in her life.
-I know. I know.

13:09.747 --> 13:11.916
But it hasn't been a tea party
for me, either.

13:13.292 --> 13:14.293
Okay.

13:14.752 --> 13:17.713
This may not be the best time, but I...
I got to tell you this.

13:17.797 --> 13:19.924
You know they lifted
the freeze on promotions?

13:21.008 --> 13:26.305
-I got my sergeant's promotion.
-No kidding? That's great!

13:26.388 --> 13:28.557
They're gonna announce it tomorrow.

13:28.641 --> 13:32.186
Boy, that--
Hey, I'm really happy for you, Luce.

13:32.853 --> 13:33.896
You can't say anything to anybody

13:33.979 --> 13:36.065
-'cause it's not official yet.
-No, I won't.

13:36.148 --> 13:38.567
I wanted to tell you before,
you know, everybody knows.

13:38.651 --> 13:40.444
(laughs)

13:40.528 --> 13:43.447
-Have they given you an assignment yet?
-Yeah, the Hill.

13:44.114 --> 13:46.492
The captain wants me
to be roll call sergeant.

13:47.618 --> 13:48.661
No kidding?

13:49.870 --> 13:51.580
Somebody's got to do the job, Joe.

13:54.083 --> 13:56.377
Well, that's great. That's great.
Congratulations.

13:57.962 --> 13:59.880
Yeah, right. Right.

14:01.924 --> 14:02.758
No, I mean it.

14:03.759 --> 14:06.220
Oh, yeah. You really think that.

14:07.805 --> 14:11.308
Luce, don't tell me
what I think, all right?

14:11.392 --> 14:12.810
Okay, fine, Joe.

14:12.893 --> 14:15.020
Then just forget it.
Forget I ever said anything.

14:15.104 --> 14:16.856
-Just forget it totally!
-I hate that!

14:16.939 --> 14:18.774
Sandy did that to me yesterday.

14:19.608 --> 14:21.318
You know, it's not enough
to say the right thing.

14:21.402 --> 14:24.196
Your thought has to be 100 percent right
or else you're a bum.

14:24.488 --> 14:27.324
Well, I'll tell you the truth, Luce.
I'm glad you got your promotion,

14:27.408 --> 14:29.535
but I don't like you
taking over for the sarge

14:30.160 --> 14:31.829
and I hate losing you as my partner.

14:39.920 --> 14:42.756
-I'm sorry.
-Yeah, me, too.

14:44.925 --> 14:47.219
I really need you
to be my friend right now.

14:49.096 --> 14:50.556
I could use a friend now, too.

14:53.350 --> 14:55.561
It's a blast if you'll just give
everything up.

14:55.936 --> 14:58.105
Don't you see? Oneness.

14:59.231 --> 15:01.859
Hey, you people,
turn around and listen to me.

15:01.942 --> 15:05.988
If you look at the universe
and you drop all those tape recorders

15:06.071 --> 15:07.948
and those expensive loafers

15:08.032 --> 15:11.160
and New York steak
and lobster material crap,

15:11.243 --> 15:14.246
you're gonna see there's only
one side to everything.

15:14.330 --> 15:16.040
Oneness! One!

15:16.498 --> 15:19.126
You see, it ain't control
over the external world

15:19.209 --> 15:21.754
that the human spirit is screaming for

15:21.837 --> 15:25.174
as much as it is
getting the heck away from it all.

15:25.257 --> 15:28.135
And I'm talking nirvana
through contemplation.

15:28.761 --> 15:32.806
And that's thinking.
Nothing but pure thinking.

15:32.890 --> 15:36.477
Life is a-- is a blast
if you'll just give everything up.

15:36.560 --> 15:37.561
Don't you see?

15:38.270 --> 15:42.816
Life is a waterdrop on a lotus leaf.
You can't get more explicit than that.

15:44.234 --> 15:46.487
Hey, you guys. Not so fast.

15:46.570 --> 15:48.739
I want to clue you in
to the other side of oneness.

15:48.822 --> 15:51.325
You listening?
Get fat off of the love of man,

15:51.408 --> 15:53.577
but starve on the love of money.
You hear me?

15:53.661 --> 15:56.538
Hey, friend, take you and your oneness
and hit the road, will you?

15:56.622 --> 15:58.499
We're trying to watch the dancing here.

15:58.582 --> 16:01.210
Corruptions of the flesh, man.

16:01.293 --> 16:03.587
Now, we all got to abstain from sex.

16:04.088 --> 16:07.007
-Forget enjoyment--
-Shut up, pajama breath.

16:07.091 --> 16:09.259
Hey, I'm begging you now.

16:09.343 --> 16:11.971
You listen to me.
You listen to the oneness of love.

16:12.054 --> 16:14.390
-(growls)
-Love is all powerful.

16:14.473 --> 16:16.725
You gonna be stupid
and dispute me on that?

16:16.809 --> 16:17.977
Yeah.

16:20.020 --> 16:22.815
Your contempt is but a shallow pool.

16:23.232 --> 16:25.651
-And so's your mother.
-That's enough.

16:25.734 --> 16:27.528
And I'm gonna melt your heart.

16:38.038 --> 16:39.957
(screams)

16:46.630 --> 16:48.257
(siren blaring)

16:54.430 --> 16:58.308
Get your stinking hands off me!
I'm a man of God!

16:58.392 --> 17:00.144
And I'm a cop. You're under arrest.

17:00.227 --> 17:05.733
I warn you. I'm gonna fast till death!
I'm gonna refuse all food and water!

17:11.113 --> 17:12.948
-(radio chatter)
-RENKO: Is it this floor, ma'am?

17:13.032 --> 17:16.535
Mm-mm. Next. They've been jumping
and throwing things about

17:16.618 --> 17:17.828
for half an hour.

17:17.911 --> 17:19.830
Poor man lives alone up there.

17:20.539 --> 17:21.915
Ma'am, I don't blame you.

17:21.999 --> 17:23.375
I don't blame you
for being upset about it.

17:23.459 --> 17:26.545
If I was all alone like you
and heard this sort of thing going on.

17:26.628 --> 17:29.590
I just want you to know we got here
as fast as we could.

17:29.673 --> 17:32.718
Hey! Hold it, boy.
I want you to stay right there.

17:32.801 --> 17:35.387
-Paco!
-Ah!

17:35.471 --> 17:37.973
-(shouts)
-Hey, come back here!

17:38.057 --> 17:39.433
Hey, hold it! Hold it!

17:39.516 --> 17:41.393
(shouting)

17:42.686 --> 17:44.104
-Hey!
-(screams)

17:44.188 --> 17:47.232
Hey, hold it! Hey, come back here.

17:47.316 --> 17:49.318
Get off me, man! Get off me, pig!

17:54.531 --> 17:56.492
(grunting)

17:56.575 --> 18:00.746
-Get off, man! Get off!
-Oh, Mr. Anderson.

18:00.829 --> 18:03.540
-They look familiar?
-Yeah, the Diablo twins.

18:03.624 --> 18:05.751
(speaking Spanish)

18:05.834 --> 18:08.754
-(screams) He's dead! He's dead!
-(overlapping chatter)

18:08.837 --> 18:12.549
You killed him, you animals!

18:12.633 --> 18:14.843
HENRY: The warrant
specifies video tapes, J.D.

18:14.927 --> 18:19.848
Anyplace on premises they might be stored.
Pimp's the lessee. Name's Lester Menley.

18:19.932 --> 18:23.727
-Let's see if we can't find him, too.
-Randazzo killing?

18:23.811 --> 18:26.188
They're gonna sell some newspapers
on this one, Frank,

18:26.271 --> 18:29.066
Assemblyman, love nest, nose candy.

18:29.858 --> 18:30.692
Her.

18:30.776 --> 18:33.153
-Did she kill him?
-I don't think so.

18:33.612 --> 18:36.615
-I mean, I think it was self-defense.
-We get a statement?

18:37.199 --> 18:39.284
I'd like to interrogate her alone.
She seems to trust me.

18:39.368 --> 18:41.245
Had a couple minutes with her
at the scene.

18:46.416 --> 18:50.003
WHITNEY: I'd give the money to Lester.
He'd take out expenses and give me half.

18:51.004 --> 18:55.259
-With a regular like, like this--
-Assemblyman Randazzo?

18:55.342 --> 18:58.554
Mm-hmm.
That would be 500 for two hours.

18:59.888 --> 19:02.641
It's a knack helping busy people relax,
you know?

19:02.724 --> 19:05.310
Maybe there'd be something special
that they'd like.

19:05.394 --> 19:07.521
In Randazzo's case, guns.

19:07.604 --> 19:09.356
He got off on guns.

19:09.773 --> 19:10.858
By pointing them at you?

19:11.191 --> 19:14.153
Once he even shot at a lamp
just to prove to me that it was loaded.

19:14.486 --> 19:18.448
But it wasn't supposed to be loaded ever.
But he'd get loaded.

19:19.658 --> 19:23.203
So after he shot the lamp out,
I told him that he couldn't come back.

19:24.621 --> 19:27.624
But then he... he got better for a while.

19:28.458 --> 19:30.252
Who needs real guns?

19:30.335 --> 19:32.462
Enough guys get off on water pistols.

19:36.008 --> 19:36.967
What?

19:38.760 --> 19:39.761
You like that?

19:40.345 --> 19:42.931
-You like water pistols?
-Me?

19:43.932 --> 19:45.142
No.

19:48.353 --> 19:49.855
I don't like guns of any kind.

19:51.732 --> 19:54.902
-Look, Whitney--
-This is the entire truth.

19:56.111 --> 19:59.740
The guy was wrecked.
He told me the gun was loaded.

19:59.948 --> 20:02.284
So I said then we weren't doing anything.

20:03.535 --> 20:06.413
Then there was a financial adjustment.

20:07.915 --> 20:09.875
So I reconsidered my position.

20:10.626 --> 20:12.836
After which he really went nuts.

20:13.295 --> 20:15.172
He started poking me with the gun.

20:16.006 --> 20:17.466
And I tried to walk away.

20:18.675 --> 20:21.970
But he-he just kept poking me with it.

20:22.721 --> 20:23.680
So I pushed it.

20:24.139 --> 20:26.308
And then he-he pointed it...

20:27.100 --> 20:28.435
at my face.

20:30.812 --> 20:32.481
Started screaming at me.

20:33.523 --> 20:36.026
I tried to get it away from him and...

20:38.195 --> 20:39.238
it went off.

20:45.035 --> 20:47.663
Look, Whitney.

20:49.456 --> 20:53.752
Lester's machine wasn't plugged in,
but if there were tapes of other nights,

20:53.835 --> 20:55.629
they'd show Randazzo playing with his gun.

20:55.712 --> 20:57.464
-Right?
-Yes.

20:58.006 --> 20:59.675
If there are tapes,
they're gonna help you, Whitney.

20:59.758 --> 21:01.301
They're gonna support your story.

21:01.426 --> 21:05.514
He had a closet downstairs.
He kept some trunks and things.

21:06.723 --> 21:08.100
Excuse me.

21:10.769 --> 21:13.647
Officer, Michael Shapiro
representing Ms. Barnes.

21:14.147 --> 21:15.857
You didn't talk this guy's ear off,
did you, kiddo?

21:15.941 --> 21:17.859
-Why not?
-We're investigating every aspect

21:17.943 --> 21:20.028
of your client's self-defense claim,
Mr. Shapiro.

21:20.112 --> 21:22.281
I'll try to keep Whitney
informed of development.

21:22.364 --> 21:23.991
-Thank you, Lieutenant.
-Excuse me.

21:25.450 --> 21:27.661
MAN: You got your four basic forces
in the universe.

21:27.744 --> 21:31.623
Your weak force, your strong force,
electromagnetism and gravity.

21:31.707 --> 21:34.251
So what do you think
those-those atheist eggheads

21:34.334 --> 21:36.795
that are living off the government
are trying to do?

21:36.878 --> 21:40.799
They're trying to combine it all
into one all-powerful super force.

21:40.882 --> 21:44.011
One basic premise of the whole flipping
scheme of things.

21:44.761 --> 21:47.347
Now that's God. That's oneness.

21:47.723 --> 21:49.433
Not twoness or threeness.

21:49.516 --> 21:50.892
-Oneness.
-Last name?

21:50.976 --> 21:52.519
Gandhi.

21:52.602 --> 21:54.271
-Is that with an H?
-Yeah.

21:55.981 --> 21:58.692
You know what happens to your soul
when you croak, smart guy?

21:59.693 --> 22:02.904
-You could come back here as an animal.
-I like animals.

22:03.447 --> 22:05.157
-First name?
-Dave.

22:05.240 --> 22:08.076
How about a rat that eats garbage
out of the sewer?

22:08.160 --> 22:10.370
You don't know anybody's
gonna come back as a rat.

22:10.454 --> 22:13.999
There you go again disputing me.
Disputing holy Vishnu.

22:14.082 --> 22:17.502
-Don't get him started, would you, Archie?
-I got a right to my opinion.

22:19.963 --> 22:21.256
Disharmony.

22:22.257 --> 22:23.633
That's all I see in the world.

22:24.634 --> 22:26.762
Disharmony and wise guys.

22:26.845 --> 22:30.474
You have everything there is, Chief.
He's dead. There was gunplay.

22:31.808 --> 22:33.185
Whitney Barnes, yeah.

22:33.769 --> 22:35.771
Well, that depends on what the tape shows.

22:36.563 --> 22:38.940
There's a hidden camera in the apartment.
Wasn't on for the main performance,

22:39.024 --> 22:40.984
but the other nights
may support her story.

22:41.777 --> 22:44.237
I don't know who else. I don't know.

22:45.322 --> 22:46.156
Damn it, Chief, I don't know!

22:46.239 --> 22:48.700
When I know, you'll know.
You'll have to excuse me, now.

22:55.624 --> 22:57.125
-Hold it.
-Hey, sailor.

22:58.251 --> 22:59.586
You want to see some pictures?

22:59.669 --> 23:01.505
-Squad room holding.
-Are those the tapes?

23:01.588 --> 23:03.173
We're gonna go through them, Whitney,
see if they corroborate.

23:03.256 --> 23:05.258
-Can you give us a guess on time?
-Hard to say.

23:05.342 --> 23:07.677
Upstairs... [mutters]
I don't know what kind of tapes you got,

23:07.761 --> 23:09.471
but I got a couple different machines
set up and ready to go.

23:09.554 --> 23:13.517
-Way to go, Lieutenant.
-Excuse me. Move, move, move!

23:13.600 --> 23:15.143
Come on, move, move.

23:15.227 --> 23:16.728
-Don't rush me.
-Just shut up.

23:16.812 --> 23:19.106
(clamoring)

23:19.981 --> 23:20.941
What did they do?

23:21.024 --> 23:23.527
-Homicide, Captain.
-Kiss your mama, man.

23:23.610 --> 23:25.529
-Get me Bernstein.
-(speaking in Spanish)

23:25.612 --> 23:27.322
-Did you bring these two in yesterday?
-Yes, I did.

23:27.406 --> 23:29.366
-And they robbed someone else today?
-And they killed him.

23:29.449 --> 23:31.284
-Take it easy.
-All right, man. Chill out.

23:31.368 --> 23:34.037
-(speaking Spanish)
-What? What?

23:34.121 --> 23:35.789
Hey, don't talk to loud. I can't hear you.

23:35.872 --> 23:38.333
-Talk English. We're in America now.
-Shut up!

23:38.417 --> 23:41.044
Frank, my office said you called.

23:41.461 --> 23:45.048
What do you know about the legalities
of spreading ashes on public property?

23:45.382 --> 23:47.634
-Ashes?
-Phil's remains.

23:47.717 --> 23:49.136
He asked that they be scattered
over the Hill

23:49.219 --> 23:50.345
and evidently that's illegal.

23:50.887 --> 23:53.306
Private property
only with the owner's consent.

23:53.390 --> 23:54.766
-Except for the ocean.
-I know.

23:54.850 --> 23:56.643
Mortuary's been pushing that one.

23:56.726 --> 23:58.019
They won't release the ashes to me

23:58.103 --> 24:00.689
unless I can give them a legal destination
for the permit.

24:00.772 --> 24:02.107
A vase on our coffee table?

24:06.153 --> 24:07.279
How was your day?

24:08.738 --> 24:11.032
Ask me once I see the Rodriguez brothers.

24:13.869 --> 24:16.663
Looking nice, Counselor. Yo, Frankie.

24:16.746 --> 24:19.624
No attitude, Jesus.
I'll wipe it right off your face.

24:19.708 --> 24:21.793
The Rodriguez brothers did a murder.

24:21.877 --> 24:24.588
-I heard, I'm sorry.
-And I hold you accountable.

24:24.671 --> 24:26.214
I take account for what I do--

24:26.298 --> 24:28.550
-You dealt for them yesterday.
-And?

24:28.633 --> 24:31.136
-And today they committed a murder.
-That's separate business.

24:31.219 --> 24:32.971
That makes you the head of nothing.

24:33.054 --> 24:35.807
Are you implying I'm responsible
for this murder?

24:35.891 --> 24:37.392
You won't do time for it, but yes.

24:37.476 --> 24:38.685
What about you?

24:39.102 --> 24:41.021
We did this business together, Furillo.

24:41.104 --> 24:43.064
-Are you responsible?
-Yes.

24:45.609 --> 24:46.860
Take it easy, Frankie.

24:46.943 --> 24:51.364
Frank, Frank, Leo was bringing
the Diablos up, they jumped him.

24:52.616 --> 24:53.575
Come on.

24:56.077 --> 24:58.747
-You pigs better move! Come on!
-Put those guns down!

24:58.830 --> 25:02.042
-You see this?
-No one has to get hurt, son.

25:02.125 --> 25:05.086
-Now just let him go.
-You come closer, he gets it in the eye!

25:06.463 --> 25:07.589
You're not getting out of here.

25:08.048 --> 25:10.675
-Let him go.
-Back off, I'll kill him, man!

25:10.759 --> 25:12.469
I said back off or he gets it
through his head, man.

25:12.552 --> 25:13.803
I mean it!

25:14.346 --> 25:15.347
We can wait them out, Frank.

25:15.430 --> 25:18.517
-Let him go.
-Jesus, what are you talking about, man?

25:19.142 --> 25:22.437
Hey, don't talk to those pigs!
Come here, talk to me, man.

25:25.398 --> 25:27.943
(speaking Spanish)

25:28.026 --> 25:30.862
-Help us, man.
-Just let him go now.

25:31.238 --> 25:32.531
Hey, man, but he could
get us out of here, man.

25:32.614 --> 25:34.282
If they try to stop us, I'll kill him!

25:34.366 --> 25:36.076
-(speaks in Spanish)
-Don't be stupid!

25:36.785 --> 25:38.119
You're juveniles.

25:38.495 --> 25:41.039
You're looking at three years max
for that old man.

25:41.665 --> 25:43.458
Now let him go now.

25:43.542 --> 25:45.502
(speaking Spanish)

25:45.585 --> 25:47.087
-Paco, listen to him.
-Shut up!

25:47.170 --> 25:49.881
He's supposed to help us, man!
Get out of here! We don't need you!

25:49.965 --> 25:51.716
-Traitor!
-I'm giving you life!

25:52.676 --> 25:56.263
You hurt that man,
they ain't gonna let you live.

25:57.180 --> 25:59.307
Now let him go, now!

25:59.391 --> 26:02.143
-Paco.
-Now.

26:02.227 --> 26:04.646
-Paco!
-All right, get out of here, man!

26:04.729 --> 26:06.815
-And you're supposed to help us, man!
-HOWARD: Holding, upstairs!

26:06.898 --> 26:07.732
Get those cuffs back on them.

26:07.816 --> 26:10.902
-And you, too, little brother!
-I didn't do anything.

26:17.033 --> 26:19.869
I want special circumstances
for the Rodriguez brothers.

26:19.953 --> 26:21.121
I want them treated as adults.

26:21.204 --> 26:24.332
-It's not in policy guidelines--
-To hell with policy guidelines.

26:24.416 --> 26:26.626
They committed murder
and took an officer hostage.

26:26.710 --> 26:29.462
Which, let's face it,
has nothing to do with your demands.

26:29.546 --> 26:32.299
You're angry phone calls to my office.
Your rage right now.

26:32.382 --> 26:33.967
You're unreasonableness
about this whole damn case.

26:34.050 --> 26:37.721
Now, look, I know you made that deal
for the truck hijackers with Martinez.

26:37.804 --> 26:40.432
Believe me, we are not
gonna let them off easy.

26:41.433 --> 26:43.268
If it's any consolation to you,
Michigan Avenue

26:43.351 --> 26:45.729
just started packing
its overflow off to juvie.

26:45.812 --> 26:46.896
Want to punish these kids like adults?

26:46.980 --> 26:49.816
Believe me, at juvie,
they are gonna get treated like adults.

26:49.899 --> 26:51.943
-Where's the Whitney Barnes meeting?
-Check at the desk.

26:53.737 --> 26:55.947
Captain, we've gone through
most of those tapes.

26:56.031 --> 26:57.991
-And?
-Well, she's on them a bunch of times

26:58.074 --> 26:59.576
with that state assemblyman.

26:59.659 --> 27:02.537
-Pretty crazy dude.
-Do the tapes support her story?

27:02.621 --> 27:06.374
-Oh, yeah. Heavy into gunplay.
-All right, let ADA Bernstein know.

27:06.458 --> 27:08.960
Tell you something, Captain, this Whitney,

27:09.044 --> 27:11.338
she was working out
with some heavy-duty citizens.

27:11.421 --> 27:13.715
-Anyone pertaining to this case?
-Not yet.

27:13.798 --> 27:15.091
Still got some tapes
to go through, though.

27:15.175 --> 27:16.259
All right, let me know
as soon as you finish.

27:16.343 --> 27:17.469
Right, Captain.

27:20.930 --> 27:22.974
Phone slip out of your hand, Frank?

27:23.933 --> 27:25.727
Sorry, Chief, rough day.

27:26.394 --> 27:28.647
I understand those kids
you sprung croaked a guy.

27:28.730 --> 27:32.067
I didn't spring anybody. I made a deal
for information with a citizen.

27:32.567 --> 27:34.819
You've got to run a precinct up here.
I understand that.

27:36.446 --> 27:38.740
This Whitney Barnes woman.

27:39.032 --> 27:40.075
What about her?

27:40.450 --> 27:42.077
I need to look at those tapes you seized.

27:42.160 --> 27:44.162
-Why?
-Why, Frank?

27:44.996 --> 27:47.415
Because I've just gotten off the phone
with some people in Washington

27:47.499 --> 27:49.209
who requested that I do so

27:49.668 --> 27:51.795
because security questions
are involved here

27:51.878 --> 27:54.089
that have to be acknowledged
and dealt with.

27:54.756 --> 27:57.258
Now that I've troubled explaining myself
to a subordinate,

27:57.342 --> 28:00.637
I'd like you to set up a damn room
so I can see the damn films.

28:01.054 --> 28:02.972
LaRue and Washington
are running them upstairs.

28:04.057 --> 28:05.225
You're kidding me.

28:06.434 --> 28:07.686
Tell me.

28:07.769 --> 28:10.438
They say the tapes
tend to support her statement.

28:10.522 --> 28:13.274
What have had they said about
who's on those films?

28:13.358 --> 28:15.485
Some prominent citizens.
I didn't ask names.

28:17.737 --> 28:20.532
-Given the tapes tend to exculpate--
-That means they clear you.

28:20.615 --> 28:23.952
The only charge we'd contemplate
would be involuntary manslaughter.

28:24.035 --> 28:25.662
Some questions
remain as to traces of cocaine

28:25.745 --> 28:26.913
and barbiturates found on premises.

28:26.996 --> 28:29.457
-Ownership of which we deny.
-Understood.

28:29.541 --> 28:31.751
I'm establishing bail considerations.

28:31.835 --> 28:34.129
Assuming she can make it,
my inclination is to go

28:34.212 --> 28:36.673
for 30,000 bond,
ten percent cash alternative.

28:37.465 --> 28:38.383
Acceptable.

28:40.677 --> 28:42.762
I haven't got $3,000, Mike.

28:42.846 --> 28:44.639
Shapiro provides.

28:44.723 --> 28:47.767
We've got opening bids of 25,000
for the love nest story,

28:47.851 --> 28:49.561
and 32 for your life.

28:50.186 --> 28:54.065
Mr. Desjardins.
I'm taking this straight to your captain.

28:54.149 --> 28:56.192
-What's going on?
-I caught him stealing envelopes.

28:56.276 --> 28:58.570
-That's not true, Captain.
-Who in the hell is he?

28:58.653 --> 29:00.447
This man is from
general accounting, Frank.

29:00.530 --> 29:02.866
He's-he's investigating
missing office supplies.

29:02.949 --> 29:05.994
I found over $20 worth of envelopes
in his locker.

29:06.077 --> 29:07.120
My office.

29:15.587 --> 29:17.922
It's true, Captain. I was stealing.

29:18.339 --> 29:21.468
I estimate you've been losing
about $15 a day in pilfered material.

29:21.551 --> 29:23.178
-Mister...?
-Desjardins.

29:23.261 --> 29:25.346
-Desjardin.
-Mr. Desjardin.

29:25.430 --> 29:27.974
Looks as if you've done a fine piece
of detective work here.

29:28.057 --> 29:31.060
-I'll communicate same to your office.
-All in a day's work, sir.

29:31.144 --> 29:34.397
With your permission, I'd like to handle
discipline internally.

29:34.481 --> 29:36.483
No. Termination
has always been the policy--

29:36.566 --> 29:39.068
I'm well aware of policy, Mr. Desjardin.

29:39.152 --> 29:42.280
Still, I'd ask you
to let us handle it from in here.

29:42.947 --> 29:43.907
He's your man.

29:44.991 --> 29:46.117
I appreciate it.

29:49.579 --> 29:51.164
Well, you'll want the evidence.

29:51.873 --> 29:55.084
-Of course, I will report my findings.
-Of course.

29:57.253 --> 29:59.672
-You'll excuse us, Ray.
-Certainly, Frank.

30:08.389 --> 30:09.724
Tell me why, Leo.

30:11.810 --> 30:15.438
My wife has a home seed business.

30:16.105 --> 30:18.566
You know, flowers, vegetables.

30:20.443 --> 30:22.529
-I wanted to help her out.
-How long?

30:23.530 --> 30:24.948
A couple of months.

30:26.491 --> 30:28.493
About the time
your wife started going out nights?

30:31.371 --> 30:33.957
Okay, the borrowing of office supplies
stops right now.

30:34.040 --> 30:36.167
There'll be no more mention of it,
but if there's a recurrence,

30:36.251 --> 30:37.669
I'm gonna have to let you go.

30:40.255 --> 30:41.381
How are things at home now?

30:42.507 --> 30:43.550
I don't know.

30:44.676 --> 30:48.847
But I'm working on it, Captain.
I'm... I'm taking care of it.

30:49.722 --> 30:50.890
What about professional help?

30:52.350 --> 30:55.395
Captain, the only place I need
professional help is here.

30:56.104 --> 30:59.232
I'm supposed to be in charge
of lockup and transport.

30:59.315 --> 31:03.403
I wind up being a nurse,
a babysitter, a lunch wagon.

31:05.029 --> 31:09.409
Today, I almost get killed
for my troubles, in case nobody noticed.

31:10.785 --> 31:12.495
All right, take the rest of the day.

31:13.705 --> 31:14.998
We'll talk about it tomorrow.

31:16.332 --> 31:17.166
Yes, sir.

31:19.168 --> 31:20.211
Thank you, sir.

31:23.590 --> 31:26.968
JUDGE: Transferred to family court
per the people's motion.

31:27.051 --> 31:27.927
(chuckles)

31:28.011 --> 31:30.346
Defendants to be transferred
to juvenile hall.

31:30.889 --> 31:33.057
-(bangs gavel)
-Next case.

31:33.850 --> 31:36.686
BAILIFF: Ninety-four on the calendar.
Charged with assault, harassment...

31:36.769 --> 31:39.647
I understand your attorney
is cutting a 40k deal with <i>The Trib.</i>

31:40.982 --> 31:43.443
I don't know. I'm not sure.

31:44.736 --> 31:48.781
Whitney Barnes' story is pretty hot stuff.
Sexposé of the year.

31:48.865 --> 31:51.075
Look, I'm in jail and I'm broke.

31:56.789 --> 31:57.999
Just seems like...

31:59.626 --> 32:02.837
putting it in the paper just seems like
selling yourself all over again.

32:02.921 --> 32:05.048
What else have I got to sell, Lieutenant?

32:10.678 --> 32:11.888
I'm not saying what I mean.

32:13.014 --> 32:14.390
What do you mean to say?

32:15.308 --> 32:16.601
Just...

32:17.644 --> 32:18.978
(chuckles)

32:19.604 --> 32:22.482
You seem like a nice person,
and I'm sorry you're in this trouble.

32:25.234 --> 32:27.445
I should get out on bail tonight.

32:29.530 --> 32:30.907
That's not what I mean, either.

32:33.993 --> 32:35.119
My mistake.

32:39.958 --> 32:42.210
BAILIFF: Calendar number 95,
Whitney Barnes.

32:42.293 --> 32:44.587
Charge is involuntary manslaughter.

32:45.004 --> 32:47.548
Bail agreement between defense
and the DA has been arranged.

32:48.174 --> 32:49.926
(bangs gavel)

32:52.553 --> 32:55.765
Am I correct,
we're agreed on $30,000 bond,

32:55.848 --> 32:58.851
3,000 cash alternative
which has just been posted?

32:58.935 --> 33:00.895
-Is that correct, Mr. Shapiro?
-It's correct, Judge.

33:00.979 --> 33:03.690
-BERNSTEIN: That's right, Your Honor.
-We're running behind.

33:04.357 --> 33:06.234
Without further ado, people.

33:07.944 --> 33:12.115
March 14th, Superior Part 42,

33:12.198 --> 33:15.034
for plea and probation report.

33:17.036 --> 33:21.874
I'm, uh, fully cognizant
this is a, uh, racy case,

33:21.958 --> 33:24.877
which is exactly what this overworked
court doesn't need right now,

33:24.961 --> 33:31.718
so any questions, interviews, etcetera,
will be conducted outside.

33:31.801 --> 33:34.053
-(bangs gavel)
-JUDGE: Next case.

33:34.137 --> 33:36.514
(reporters clamoring)

33:36.597 --> 33:39.517
Station managers should contact me
by 6:00 p.m. with their bids

33:39.600 --> 33:41.144
for Ms. Barnes' exclusive love nest story.

33:41.227 --> 33:43.146
Can you give us some idea
of the names involved?

33:43.229 --> 33:45.606
Right now we anticipate
a 16-segment serial

33:45.690 --> 33:47.066
featuring a different
well-known individual.

33:47.150 --> 33:49.360
Don't you also anticipate libel suit?

33:49.444 --> 33:51.529
I can assure you
that all of Ms. Barnes' claims

33:51.612 --> 33:53.239
will be graphically substantiated.

33:53.322 --> 33:55.491
-Are you saying that you have pictures?
-Video tape.

33:55.575 --> 33:59.704
-Free enterprise, ain't it grand?
-(clamoring)

34:00.121 --> 34:02.832
FRANK: I'm aware of the legalities.
Isn't there a special permit?

34:03.458 --> 34:05.043
I'm sure burial at sea would be very nice,

34:05.126 --> 34:07.086
even popular,
but that's not what he wanted.

34:07.462 --> 34:12.175
I'm not bereaved. Right. Okay. Mm-hm.

34:13.885 --> 34:15.428
Your inventory
isn't going to square, Frank.

34:15.511 --> 34:17.764
-You're gonna be two tapes short.
-Why is that?

34:18.765 --> 34:20.099
Because I removed them.

34:20.850 --> 34:23.603
Look, if they're as sensitive as you say,
why haven't I heard from the FBI

34:23.686 --> 34:26.397
-or some security agency?
-You heard it from me.

34:26.481 --> 34:28.775
Chief, I have to account
for all evidence seized.

34:28.858 --> 34:31.027
Then redo the paperwork, damn it.

34:36.115 --> 34:40.453
Frank, a few months ago Howard Hunter
showed up on some bribery tapes.

34:40.536 --> 34:42.789
-You remember that?
-Yes.

34:42.872 --> 34:45.458
Remember asking me to spare him
an IAD hearing?

34:46.000 --> 34:48.669
-To understand the circumstances?
-Sure.

34:49.712 --> 34:51.714
I'm asking you for similar relief.

34:55.676 --> 34:57.261
I slept with this girl, Frank.

34:57.929 --> 34:59.597
Cora and I weren't getting along.

35:01.099 --> 35:02.767
Anyway, I slept with her twice.

35:03.142 --> 35:04.685
Those are the tapes I'm taking.

35:05.478 --> 35:08.272
I hear Whitney is selling
her bedroom secrets to the media.

35:08.731 --> 35:12.610
Frank, just let me keep these two tapes.

35:13.111 --> 35:16.447
-I'll take my chances with the rest.
-You think she won't mention you?

35:17.573 --> 35:21.327
This girl is on tape
with dozens of serious people, Frank.

35:21.410 --> 35:22.954
She threatens to go public,

35:23.037 --> 35:25.289
I wouldn't sell her any life insurance,
would you?

35:27.959 --> 35:30.169
I'm gonna take silence as consent.

35:36.384 --> 35:38.261
Embarrassment aside, Frank,

35:39.762 --> 35:42.390
it's really something seeing yourself
perform like that.

35:49.355 --> 35:50.815
(door closes)

35:55.444 --> 35:56.529
Detective.

35:58.030 --> 36:00.324
-Captain.
-History, Detective.

36:00.408 --> 36:02.201
Retired first of the month.

36:02.285 --> 36:03.911
Security consultant.

36:03.995 --> 36:06.205
Private, corporate. Whatever.

36:07.415 --> 36:08.457
My own firm.

36:10.543 --> 36:12.879
Just wanted to say if you ever hit
the first of the month,

36:12.962 --> 36:15.006
around the 24th give me a call.

36:15.089 --> 36:16.799
I'll find you some work, okay?

36:18.176 --> 36:19.343
You know, uh...

36:20.219 --> 36:23.848
things will probably loosen up
around here moonlighting-wise

36:23.931 --> 36:26.058
now that Phil Esterhaus is gone.

36:26.142 --> 36:29.395
Don't mention his name!

36:29.729 --> 36:32.607
Ever! His name in your mouth
sounds like garbage.

36:32.690 --> 36:34.317
I won't stand for it!

36:34.400 --> 36:37.778
Mick, wait for me downstairs, would you?

36:41.449 --> 36:42.950
He's a mutt, Frank.

36:43.784 --> 36:45.912
-Belongs in a kennel at best.
-What do you want, Jerry?

36:47.079 --> 36:50.124
I just came up to express
my personal condolences

36:50.208 --> 36:53.753
and, uh, wanted you to know
I'm in security now.

36:53.836 --> 36:54.670
Good.

36:55.296 --> 36:58.966
-Good luck, Jerry. If you'll excuse me.
-Frank.

37:02.595 --> 37:04.805
I heard they're returning
vice to the precinct.

37:07.975 --> 37:12.104
I know you don't respect me right now,
but I promise you one of these days

37:12.188 --> 37:13.731
you'll understand how it is.

37:14.106 --> 37:18.152
Vice isn't about right or wrong, Frank.
It's about weakness.

37:18.236 --> 37:20.404
And everybody is weak somewhere.

37:20.821 --> 37:25.493
What happens is someone you know,
maybe even someone you love,

37:26.118 --> 37:28.704
is gonna step in brown applesauce.

37:28.788 --> 37:31.457
And they're gonna beg you, beg you,

37:31.540 --> 37:33.751
to look the other way
while they wipe their shoe.

37:35.086 --> 37:40.174
And you realize no one's gonna get hurt
if you just turn your back this one time.

37:41.092 --> 37:42.134
So you do it.

37:43.678 --> 37:45.137
And that's how it starts.

37:46.931 --> 37:48.182
And it will wind up...

37:49.809 --> 37:52.311
it will wind up--
You just try to bend a little

37:52.395 --> 37:53.771
and it will wind up...

37:56.148 --> 38:00.319
You don't know if you're on foot
or on horseback or what.

38:00.778 --> 38:03.197
Things wind up so confused.

38:03.281 --> 38:05.783
I hope the new business goes well, Jerry.

38:06.826 --> 38:08.077
Hope it goes well for you.

38:25.845 --> 38:27.805
You don't have to say anything. I know.

38:29.765 --> 38:31.267
You need a little time off, Mick?

38:32.935 --> 38:34.270
(exhales)

38:34.812 --> 38:35.771
No.

38:36.647 --> 38:37.982
I'll be okay.

38:40.860 --> 38:41.986
I miss him, too.

38:50.870 --> 38:53.664
I don't want you to misunderstand
what I'm gonna say, Captain.

38:54.957 --> 38:56.667
'Cause you're a good boss.

38:57.376 --> 38:58.753
The best I ever had.

39:00.087 --> 39:02.381
But Esterhaus was the law up here.

39:04.884 --> 39:06.552
And now that he's dead...

39:08.346 --> 39:09.388
I don't know.

39:11.182 --> 39:12.266
I'm scared.

39:14.143 --> 39:16.479
I feel like everything's gonna unravel.

39:17.563 --> 39:19.732
It's your job and mine
to see that it doesn't.

39:23.652 --> 39:24.653
Okay.

39:26.989 --> 39:28.032
I'll try.

40:17.289 --> 40:19.458
(siren blaring)

40:26.632 --> 40:27.925
Joe.

40:29.218 --> 40:30.261
Look at me.

40:31.887 --> 40:32.888
Please.

40:34.682 --> 40:37.017
<i>Che fa?</i> What's your problem?

40:38.269 --> 40:39.520
What's you's?

40:40.396 --> 40:41.730
I don't have a problem.

40:42.731 --> 40:43.607
No?

40:44.233 --> 40:45.151
No.

40:49.530 --> 40:51.866
It's not what your body's saying.

40:55.870 --> 40:57.663
(sighs) Man...

40:58.372 --> 41:01.000
Look, maybe it's just too fast.

41:01.584 --> 41:02.710
We don't have to if you don't want to.

41:02.793 --> 41:05.588
Sandy, look,
you're gonna make me crazy, all right?

41:05.671 --> 41:07.840
Just don't tell me
what I want and don't want.

41:09.341 --> 41:12.845
Okay. Then why don't you tell me
what you want?

41:13.554 --> 41:14.555
I don't know.

41:17.683 --> 41:19.059
You want to go home?

41:21.604 --> 41:22.646
Maybe I should.

41:25.024 --> 41:28.819
Joe, why can't you just hold me?
Help me get over this.

41:28.903 --> 41:30.988
Make sex okay for me again.

41:32.490 --> 41:35.409
Sandy, I'm sorry for you.

41:36.118 --> 41:38.162
And I feel your pain and your anger.

41:38.787 --> 41:40.289
And I want to kill the bastard.

41:41.457 --> 41:45.336
And I'd do anything in the world,
anything to undo what happened.

41:47.213 --> 41:49.089
But it also turns me off.

41:49.882 --> 41:52.468
Why? 'Cause I'm dirty now?

41:53.010 --> 41:54.553
No, I don't think that.

41:56.138 --> 41:59.558
I've had these strong feelings
of wanting to make love to you.

42:01.018 --> 42:04.146
You're the first woman I've ever thought
about having it all with.

42:04.230 --> 42:05.272
And now I can't.

42:07.024 --> 42:10.110
-It happens to everybody--
-It never happened to me.

42:12.655 --> 42:14.740
Look, I know you need me right now,

42:14.823 --> 42:17.618
and I hate myself
because I can't give you what you need.

42:18.661 --> 42:21.038
And I know I'm not supposed
to feel that way

42:21.580 --> 42:23.332
and that makes me feel guilty, too.

42:23.415 --> 42:26.377
I just don't know
who the hell I am right now.

42:27.253 --> 42:28.504
I don't know what I feel.

42:32.299 --> 42:33.217
Go.

42:33.842 --> 42:34.843
Just go.

42:37.930 --> 42:39.431
She's fairly bright.

42:39.765 --> 42:41.934
She's, I'd day, unusually beautiful.

42:42.768 --> 42:44.228
And the strange thing is,
given what she does,

42:44.311 --> 42:45.729
she doesn't even seem to be too cynical.

42:46.605 --> 42:48.983
There's this appealing sort of naiveté.

42:49.400 --> 42:50.442
I mean, I know she's not--

42:51.902 --> 42:54.488
Good God, all you have to do is look
at one of those tapes for five minute.

42:55.322 --> 42:56.657
Did you?

42:59.493 --> 43:00.995
Well, yes.

43:01.495 --> 43:02.830
All in the line of duty?

43:08.419 --> 43:10.170
Fay, she's not anyone to be jealous of.

43:11.422 --> 43:12.506
(scoffs)

43:12.590 --> 43:14.091
For the last half hour,
you've been telling me

43:14.174 --> 43:18.971
that she's intelligent, gorgeous,
emotionally accessible,

43:19.054 --> 43:20.598
an incredible sexual athlete.

43:21.265 --> 43:22.641
How could I not be jealous?

43:24.602 --> 43:25.769
Fay, she's a prostitute.

43:26.395 --> 43:28.355
Which is part of what attracts you.

43:28.439 --> 43:29.982
Interests me.

43:30.065 --> 43:33.360
Oh, excuse me. Interests you.

43:33.819 --> 43:37.281
-On a purely clinical level.
-Give me a break, will you?

43:37.364 --> 43:39.992
She's no threat to us,
if that's what's worrying you.

43:43.162 --> 43:46.040
Tell me that you
wouldn't like to sleep with her.

43:46.790 --> 43:49.126
Tell me that you haven't imagined
in your mind's eye

43:49.209 --> 43:52.212
her doing to you all the things
she did to those other men on those tapes.

43:52.296 --> 43:54.089
So, what, is it a felony to fantasize?

43:54.173 --> 43:56.300
It's not even a misdemeanor, Henry.

43:56.925 --> 43:58.636
Not to think them or to do them.

43:58.719 --> 44:01.347
-Meaning?
-(sighs)

44:01.430 --> 44:04.016
Meaning nothing.

44:04.099 --> 44:05.476
Come on, what?

44:07.811 --> 44:12.358
Meaning I wouldn't mind
a little sexual adventuring of my own.

44:12.441 --> 44:15.277
It's taken me a lot of years to feel okay
about that part of myself.

44:15.361 --> 44:17.696
I'd like to take advantage of it
before it's too late.

44:18.238 --> 44:21.492
Fay, I have no interests
in being a sexual Superman.

44:21.575 --> 44:23.494
I'm not talking about that.

44:25.579 --> 44:28.666
But as long as we're on the subject,
what I'm talking about is...

44:30.292 --> 44:34.380
we have friendly, comfortable sex.

44:36.548 --> 44:38.842
I'd like a little passion
to go along with it.

44:41.261 --> 44:42.721
That's a two-way street.

44:43.722 --> 44:45.933
The difference is that you'd like it
with your hooker friend

44:46.016 --> 44:47.726
and I'd like it with you.

44:50.270 --> 44:51.605
I'm sorry, Henry.

44:55.275 --> 44:56.860
It's okay. Don't be.

44:59.780 --> 45:02.032
Why do you have to be
so damn nice all the time?

45:07.204 --> 45:08.706
Henry, we have to talk.

45:09.665 --> 45:11.875
I care too much about you
to let things get--

45:13.252 --> 45:15.963
-Don't be a hero, Max, or you're dead.
-Okay.

45:16.797 --> 45:19.049
-Okay, whatever you say.
-Your wallet.

45:24.888 --> 45:27.683
All right. Now, lady, your purse.

45:30.894 --> 45:32.479
Is that a zucchini you have
in your pocket

45:32.563 --> 45:34.106
or are you just glad to see me?

45:34.189 --> 45:36.024
-What?
-Who you trying to kid, mister?

45:36.108 --> 45:37.985
What do you think,
we just fell off the vegetable truck?

45:38.068 --> 45:39.778
This is a cop. He has a real gun.

45:39.862 --> 45:42.406
-Fay!
-(gasps) He's got a real gun.

45:42.489 --> 45:45.993
Okay, now both of you
get down on the ground.

45:46.076 --> 45:47.202
I will not. It's filthy.

45:47.286 --> 45:50.372
Let's not make this any worse
than it is, okay?

45:50.956 --> 45:51.999
Okay.

45:52.791 --> 45:53.792
Okay.

45:54.501 --> 45:56.420
You move, either of you, you're dead.

46:01.925 --> 46:04.762
-Henry, he's got my purse!
-The hell with your purse.

46:09.975 --> 46:13.729
-(laughs) Oh, God.
-I fail to see the humor here.

46:14.229 --> 46:16.607
"Is that a zucchini in your pocket
or are you glad to see me?"

46:16.690 --> 46:18.901
-Well...
-Oh, boy.

46:20.778 --> 46:23.447

(sighs)

46:59.358 --> 47:00.234
I know.

47:00.776 --> 47:03.111
(phone rings)

47:03.195 --> 47:04.071
Go ahead.

47:04.655 --> 47:06.281
Maybe it's a singing telegram.

47:11.119 --> 47:12.120
Yeah, Furillo.

47:20.587 --> 47:21.588
Yeah.

47:23.507 --> 47:24.508
Okay.

47:31.765 --> 47:32.975
Whitney Barnes.

47:34.726 --> 47:37.271
(radio chatter)

47:53.704 --> 47:56.290
She was whacked. Very professional.

47:57.165 --> 48:00.043
One shot in the side of the head.
Rental car.

48:01.837 --> 48:05.173
-Anything at all from SID?
-No sign of a struggle.

48:05.883 --> 48:08.093
My guess is she thought
she was out with a john.

48:10.345 --> 48:11.346
I liked her.

48:13.765 --> 48:15.183
She was an interesting woman.

48:24.234 --> 48:27.237
(closing theme playing)
