00:02.895 --> 00:04.670
Oh, my gosh.

00:04.821 --> 00:06.338
First class is so nice.

00:06.490 --> 00:09.675
I totally understand all
the rich people in<i> Titanic</i> now.

00:10.994 --> 00:13.237
Can I interest you
in a glass of champagne?

00:13.330 --> 00:15.572
-Oh, um, how much?
-They're complimentary.

00:15.591 --> 00:17.725
Shut. Up.

00:19.595 --> 00:21.411
Mm. Hello.

00:21.430 --> 00:22.730
Hi.

00:23.916 --> 00:25.265
Oh, wow.

00:25.359 --> 00:28.727
I would take Minor Celebrities
for $200, Ken. (laughing)

00:28.954 --> 00:30.195
Get it?
It's a<i> Jeopardy!</i> joke.

00:30.422 --> 00:32.865
-What is "not the first time
I've heard it."
-(laughs)

00:33.016 --> 00:35.183
That's why you're
my favorite host.

00:35.202 --> 00:37.928
I mean, what else
am I gonna say?

00:37.946 --> 00:39.613
It's my first time
in first class.

00:39.689 --> 00:42.207
I got upgraded 'cause
I racked up a buttload of miles

00:42.359 --> 00:44.526
traveling around the world
for the past four months.

00:44.603 --> 00:46.787
I'm gonna need
another one of these.

00:46.939 --> 00:48.622
My tale begins in Madagascar.

00:48.774 --> 00:50.624
And keep them coming.

00:50.776 --> 00:54.278
Did you know that Madagascar is
the original home of the lemur?

00:54.371 --> 00:55.295
I did know that.

00:55.447 --> 00:57.539
Of course, I kind of
know everything.

00:57.558 --> 00:58.799
(laughing)

00:58.893 --> 01:01.301
It's gonna be such a fun
20 hours together.

01:01.453 --> 01:03.545
I just got back
from this amazing journey

01:03.564 --> 01:04.621
of self-discovery.

01:04.714 --> 01:05.898
Discovery number one--

01:06.125 --> 01:08.192
I will never be
a professional zip liner.

01:13.557 --> 01:15.315
Am I supposed to be
doing something?

01:15.409 --> 01:16.992
Should I pedal?

01:18.804 --> 01:21.246
Can I switch to tequila?

01:21.473 --> 01:23.082
Whoa, get out
your cell phones, folks.

01:23.309 --> 01:26.568
Mr. Jeopardy is going
for the "Potent Potables."

01:26.587 --> 01:27.920
(laughing)

01:28.089 --> 01:30.238
Okay, so next I spent some time
at an ashram in India.

01:30.257 --> 01:31.406
And I discovered that the answer

01:31.500 --> 01:33.241
to all of my problems
is acceptance.

01:33.260 --> 01:35.485
You know, I used to try
and control everything,

01:35.504 --> 01:38.246
but now I'm at peace, you know,
I just go with the flow.

01:38.324 --> 01:39.489
I even got a tattoo.

01:39.508 --> 01:42.250
It's in Sanskrit.
It says "acceptance."

01:42.344 --> 01:44.494
That says "garden salad."

01:44.588 --> 01:46.271
What?

01:46.498 --> 01:47.514
Oh.

01:47.608 --> 01:49.349
Well, I guess I'll just
have to accept it.

01:49.501 --> 01:50.776
(chuckles)
And that's how I'm gonna face

01:50.853 --> 01:53.761
every single moment of every day
for the rest of my life.

01:53.781 --> 01:55.948
Seriously?
Garden salad?

01:56.099 --> 01:57.783
You know, I was really hoping
to sleep on this flight.

01:57.934 --> 01:59.767
(laughing):
Yeah, me too, Ken.

01:59.787 --> 02:01.178
I'm just too excited

02:01.196 --> 02:02.529
to get back to my cat café
and see my friends.

02:02.606 --> 02:04.105
They don't even know
I'm coming home.

02:04.199 --> 02:06.125
In fact, I've got this
crazy surprise planned.

02:06.352 --> 02:08.702
What other kind would you have?

02:08.854 --> 02:11.797
You seem stressed, Ken.
Do you want to know my mantra?

02:11.948 --> 02:13.281
I'm not supposed to tell anyone,

02:13.300 --> 02:15.300
but I can't resist
'cause you're kind of famous.

02:15.452 --> 02:18.637
It goes, "Om... shanti,
shanti, shanti."

02:18.864 --> 02:19.972
You want to give it a try?

02:20.199 --> 02:21.381
I have my own mantra.

02:21.475 --> 02:26.520
It goes, "I'm...
gonna look for a seat in coach."

02:29.150 --> 02:31.391
How crazy was that chemistry?

02:31.543 --> 02:33.560
I'll make my move
in baggage claim.

02:43.647 --> 02:45.739
Do you not see that
I'm at work right now?

02:45.833 --> 02:47.499
I meant the bear claw.

02:47.651 --> 02:49.168
Don't be so thirsty.

02:50.229 --> 02:52.062
But I could use
15 minutes alone with you.

02:52.080 --> 02:54.581
I can't. The 10:00 a.m.
Pilates class just ended,

02:54.675 --> 02:55.899
and all of these Ashleys

02:56.068 --> 02:57.676

02:57.827 --> 02:58.919

02:59.013 --> 03:01.162
Look, I know managing
this place is a big job,

03:01.182 --> 03:02.422
but we haven't been
on a real date in weeks.

03:02.574 --> 03:05.091
Can you two lovebirds
move it along?

03:05.244 --> 03:06.760
This place is backing up
worse than Mama

03:06.854 --> 03:09.062
at the cheese festival.

03:09.765 --> 03:11.598
Ooh, that's a big one.

03:11.750 --> 03:15.101
You sound like Mama two days
after the cheese festival.

03:15.196 --> 03:17.254
Oh, you can just put that
over there. I'm a little busy.

03:17.272 --> 03:18.846
I've heard that before.

03:18.941 --> 03:22.108
I feel you, box.
The nights are cold.

03:23.262 --> 03:25.762
This seemed like such
a good idea on the plane.

03:25.855 --> 03:29.023
Of course, so did
trying to kiss Ken Jennings.

03:29.117 --> 03:30.434
What'd you order?

03:30.436 --> 03:32.860
I didn't order anything.
I thought you did.

03:32.955 --> 03:34.880
I found a box like that
in the woods once.

03:35.031 --> 03:36.548
Full of '70s porn.

03:37.367 --> 03:39.033
I didn't put it in there.

03:39.127 --> 03:40.868
I wonder what it is.

03:40.888 --> 03:43.764
(quietly):
I know how to find out. Open it.

03:47.061 --> 03:48.376
Ooh, it's really heavy.

03:48.470 --> 03:51.304
It has to be like 300,
400 pounds.

03:51.457 --> 03:52.789
Seriously?

03:52.882 --> 03:54.624
All right, enough of this.

03:54.643 --> 03:56.293
What the hell?

03:56.386 --> 03:58.052
Uh-oh.
Porn box ain't never did that.

03:58.072 --> 04:01.031
(all screaming)

04:02.468 --> 04:04.993
Surprise.

04:06.488 --> 04:07.913
Geez, how many rings
are you wearing?

04:08.082 --> 04:09.414
What are you? Tom Brady?

04:09.566 --> 04:11.065
You don't surprise
a girl from Detroit.

04:11.159 --> 04:12.567
You're lucky to be alive.

04:12.661 --> 04:13.994
I just want y'all to know

04:14.088 --> 04:17.238
I screamed like that
to be funny.

04:17.258 --> 04:18.498
Wow.

04:18.650 --> 04:20.000
Look how different
this place is.

04:20.152 --> 04:22.210
Yeah, yeah,
we made a lot of changes.

04:22.321 --> 04:23.595
Hopefully good ones.

04:23.747 --> 04:26.673
I learned on my travels
that nothing is good or bad.

04:26.767 --> 04:27.841
It just is.

04:27.935 --> 04:30.160
Well, I'm so glad
to hear you say that,

04:30.178 --> 04:33.179
because this is a juice bar now.

04:33.332 --> 04:35.590
Yeah, yeah, loving it.

04:35.609 --> 04:38.384
Uh... so quick question.
Why is it a juice bar?

04:38.445 --> 04:40.279
Okay, hear me out.
I noticed that

04:40.430 --> 04:42.839
on this street
there's a SoulCycle,

04:42.841 --> 04:44.524
a gym and a yoga studio.

04:44.676 --> 04:47.268
And I noticed
if I agree with Randi,

04:47.288 --> 04:48.787
she's nicer to me.

04:49.865 --> 04:53.350
So I thought, "Why don't we
cater to their customers?"

04:53.368 --> 04:55.852
Yeah, that's-that's good.

04:55.871 --> 04:58.446
Well, not good, but not bad.

04:58.524 --> 04:59.539
It just is.

04:59.691 --> 05:01.074
It<i> really</i> is.

05:01.226 --> 05:03.302
Well, I-I named a lot
of the smoothies.

05:03.453 --> 05:05.028
You should try
the Banana-Lama-Ding-Dong.

05:05.047 --> 05:06.029
(chuckles)

05:06.048 --> 05:07.288
Yeah, definitely.

05:07.382 --> 05:09.975
So, um... where are the cats?

05:10.126 --> 05:11.977
I told you she'd notice.

05:13.129 --> 05:16.039
Look, cats just don't make
sense for this business.

05:16.132 --> 05:17.799
But it's a cat café.

05:17.893 --> 05:18.875
Yeah, but then we thought--

05:18.968 --> 05:21.061
get ready, this is exciting--

05:21.213 --> 05:23.229
what if it wasn't?

05:24.491 --> 05:26.641
And don't worry, they all went
to really good homes.

05:26.735 --> 05:29.328
But I always thought the cats
were kind of the reason

05:29.479 --> 05:31.479
people came here to hang out.

05:31.573 --> 05:32.647
Exactly.

05:32.666 --> 05:33.648
They would just sit there
and pet them

05:33.667 --> 05:35.241
and not buy anything.

05:35.394 --> 05:36.893
We like to get people
in and out.

05:36.986 --> 05:38.411
That's why we shut off
the Wi-Fi.

05:38.564 --> 05:41.173
-Oh.
-I don't need people
taking up our tables

05:41.249 --> 05:43.066
writing their damn screenplays.

05:43.159 --> 05:44.325
It's gonna be so dope.

05:44.419 --> 05:47.587
It's like<i> Minions</i>
but they're orange.

05:48.440 --> 05:49.923
W-What about all
our regular customers?

05:50.075 --> 05:52.184
Like the sweater bro?
Toothpick girl?

05:52.335 --> 05:54.561
That guy with all the Band-Aids?

05:55.747 --> 05:57.004
Randi, my usual.

05:57.024 --> 05:58.415
Hello, Mother.

05:58.433 --> 06:00.934
Katharine!
Oh, this is so great.

06:01.028 --> 06:02.694
I had no idea
you were coming back.

06:02.846 --> 06:06.615
-Obviously, you ate well.
-Oh.

06:07.517 --> 06:08.608
Missed you, too.

06:08.760 --> 06:09.868
We were just showing Kat

06:10.095 --> 06:12.019
the changes we made
while she was gone.

06:12.039 --> 06:13.446
Aren't they wonderful?

06:13.599 --> 06:15.615
I used to come here
out of pity for you,

06:15.767 --> 06:18.359

08:44.099 --> 08:46.082
Randi tossed them out.

08:46.175 --> 08:48.434
She's like the preacher

but instead of dancing,

08:49.755 --> 08:52.272

Fourth of July songs.

are on the grill.

was waiting on this song?

Eh, not exactly.

18:01.897 --> 18:03.656
She's not returning my calls.

that I'm annoying her assistant.

18:06.477 --> 18:07.643

18:12.092 --> 18:14.908
in Nashville there's a thousand
people like me writing songs.

more connected,
