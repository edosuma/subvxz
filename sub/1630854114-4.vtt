WEBVTT

00:04.538 --> 00:07.441
Who's the best boss ever?

00:07.541 --> 00:09.277
* It's bad bitch o'clock *

00:09.377 --> 00:11.645
* Yeah, it's thick-thirty *

00:11.745 --> 00:13.614
* I've been through a lot *

00:13.714 --> 00:15.349
* But I'm still flirty *

00:15.449 --> 00:16.550
* Okay *

00:16.650 --> 00:18.052
Keep it up, everybody.

00:18.152 --> 00:20.954
You and you and you and you,
strong cores.

00:21.055 --> 00:22.823
Strong brand.

00:22.923 --> 00:25.459
* How you feelin'?
How you feel right now? *

00:25.559 --> 00:28.028
* Oh, I been so down *

00:28.129 --> 00:29.197
* And under pressure... *

00:29.297 --> 00:31.199
No. No. No.

00:31.299 --> 00:32.733
Yes. Yes. Yes.

00:32.833 --> 00:34.068
Ooh, no.

00:34.168 --> 00:35.969
* Oh... *

00:36.070 --> 00:38.739
Mm, puppies over polka dots.

00:40.574 --> 00:42.676
* Uh, bitch, I might be better *

00:42.776 --> 00:44.678
* Turn up the music *

00:44.778 --> 00:47.047
* Turn down the lights *

00:47.148 --> 00:50.718
* I got a feelin'
I'm gon' be alright *

00:50.818 --> 00:53.487
* Okay *
* Okay *

00:53.587 --> 00:54.988
* Alright *
MAN: Ms. Wheeler?

00:55.089 --> 00:57.225
* It's about damn time,
turn up the music *

00:57.325 --> 00:58.426
Ms. Wheeler?

00:58.526 --> 01:00.961
Oh. Hi, sorry.

01:01.061 --> 01:05.766
I was just, uh, doing
a little creative meditation.

01:05.866 --> 01:07.401
Oh, didn't mean to interrupt.

01:07.501 --> 01:09.903
No, no, no. No.
What can I do ya for?

01:10.003 --> 01:14.175
I don't know if you remember me.
Jared, Customer Relations.

01:14.275 --> 01:16.577
Sure, Jared.

01:16.677 --> 01:19.213
Customer Relations, of course.
(chuckling)

01:19.313 --> 01:22.483
I just wanted to say
your memo on brand engagement

01:22.583 --> 01:24.218
was really insightful.

01:24.318 --> 01:25.386
You read my memo?

01:25.486 --> 01:26.587
Read it?

01:26.687 --> 01:28.322
I memorized it.
(chuckles softly)

01:28.422 --> 01:29.657
No.

01:30.458 --> 01:33.327
"Our brand relies
on four core principles

01:33.427 --> 01:34.895
"or, as I like
to call them...

01:34.995 --> 01:37.265
BOTH:
...the four toes of success."

01:37.365 --> 01:38.566
Oh, my God!

01:38.666 --> 01:39.900
I'm kind of a marketing nerd.

01:40.000 --> 01:41.602
Hoping to do
what you do some day.

01:41.702 --> 01:45.038
Well, that is great.
You know, dream that dream.

01:45.139 --> 01:49.743
And stay hungry.
But also stay curious.

01:49.843 --> 01:52.346
(chuckling)
Would you ever have time to...

01:52.446 --> 01:54.215
to give me some career advice?

01:54.315 --> 01:56.617
Yeah, I kind of just did.

01:56.717 --> 01:59.253
Right, sorry, uh...
Thank you for your time.

01:59.353 --> 02:01.455
Uh, h-hang on.

02:01.555 --> 02:03.457
You feel stuck,
don't you?

02:03.557 --> 02:05.058
I do.
Oh...

02:05.159 --> 02:06.794
I know what that's like.

02:06.894 --> 02:10.531
I wish I had someone like me
to help me when I was you.

02:10.631 --> 02:12.433
Sure.
Mm-hmm.

02:12.533 --> 02:14.935
You know what?
I'm taking you on.

02:15.035 --> 02:17.938
You just got
yourself a mentor.

02:18.038 --> 02:19.607
Really?
Mm-hmm.

02:19.707 --> 02:20.841
Thank you, Ms. Wheeler.

02:20.941 --> 02:23.411
Christina.
Christina.

02:23.511 --> 02:25.379
(chuckles)
Okay, well,

02:25.479 --> 02:27.080
I-I should get back
to the phones.

02:27.181 --> 02:30.117
Oh, you go get 'em,
Jerry from Customer Relations.

02:30.218 --> 02:31.285
It-it's Jared.

02:31.385 --> 02:32.786
It's J... Yeah, Jared.

02:32.886 --> 02:34.955
That's what I said. So...
(chuckling)

02:37.258 --> 02:38.692
I got to write another memo.

02:38.792 --> 02:40.694
* Alright *

02:40.794 --> 02:42.230
* It's about damn time *

02:42.330 --> 02:43.464
* In a minute, I'm-a need... *

02:43.564 --> 02:45.366
Ow, ow, ow.

02:45.466 --> 02:49.503
("Ifanla" by Sola Akingbola
playing)

03:10.524 --> 03:11.992
Damn.

03:12.092 --> 03:14.428
He cooks dinner
and makes a mean mojito.

03:14.528 --> 03:18.232
Bob, I might have to leave
my husband for you.

03:19.166 --> 03:21.068
Well, I do not want yours.

03:22.536 --> 03:23.837
It's so funny.

03:23.937 --> 03:27.007
You married a businessman,
and now you have a wife.

03:27.107 --> 03:28.476
Hey, I am a modern man.

03:28.576 --> 03:30.711
There is strength
and masculinity

03:30.811 --> 03:32.079
in being a caretaker.

03:32.179 --> 03:34.615
You keep telling yourself that.

03:35.483 --> 03:37.585
Don't listen to her, Bob.
You put in your 30 years.

03:37.685 --> 03:41.088
If you want to sit around
and make us lamb chops,

03:41.188 --> 03:43.357
I'll be right here, baby.
Gloria.

03:43.457 --> 03:46.360
Hmm?
You have your own husband.

03:47.395 --> 03:49.430
Why do these towels smell funny?

03:50.664 --> 03:52.400
Ooh, what's that--
lavender?

03:52.500 --> 03:54.167
Straight from my herb garden.

03:54.268 --> 03:56.637
You have a herb garden?
I do.

03:56.737 --> 03:58.339
Okay.

03:59.206 --> 04:01.509
Bob makes
his own fabric softener.

04:01.609 --> 04:04.712
It's just baking soda,
vinegar and essential oils,

04:04.812 --> 04:05.846
and a cap full of love.

04:05.946 --> 04:07.515
Can I get some of that?

04:07.615 --> 04:10.150
Uh, you want lavender
or bayou breeze?

04:10.250 --> 04:12.420
Oh, take me to the bayou.

04:12.520 --> 04:14.187
(chuckles)
Uh, what about me?

04:14.288 --> 04:15.956
Do I not deserve
nice-smelling sheets?

04:16.056 --> 04:17.791
There's a Costco
on the way home,

04:17.891 --> 04:19.460
knock yourself out.

04:20.361 --> 04:23.130
He even holds a grudge
like a woman.

04:26.133 --> 04:28.369
(indistinct conversations)

04:29.603 --> 04:31.238
(sighs)

04:31.339 --> 04:33.307
Are you expecting anyone else?

04:33.407 --> 04:35.909
Oh, maybe someday.

04:36.009 --> 04:37.778
Not tonight.

04:37.878 --> 04:39.547
Oh, thanks.

04:39.647 --> 04:41.849
It's less sad if you take it.

04:48.522 --> 04:50.791
You guys on a date?
(chuckles)

04:50.891 --> 04:53.126
Must be nice.

04:55.829 --> 04:57.030
Uh...

04:57.130 --> 04:58.566
r-room for one more?

04:58.666 --> 05:02.336
Hey.
Oh, uh, I guess, sure.

05:02.436 --> 05:04.204
Thanks.
(chuckles)

05:04.304 --> 05:05.272
Oh, uh,

05:05.373 --> 05:07.207
I had a business dinner,

05:07.307 --> 05:09.109
but my client's...

05:09.209 --> 05:12.613
dog had puppies.

05:13.647 --> 05:15.148
At least you have an excuse,

05:15.248 --> 05:16.917
I was drinking alone
like a loser.

05:17.017 --> 05:20.287
Oh.
I remember that feeling.

05:22.222 --> 05:23.991
So, how do you do it?

05:24.492 --> 05:25.726
How do you break through

05:25.826 --> 05:27.861
to an executive position?

05:27.961 --> 05:29.229
Oh, it's simple.

05:29.329 --> 05:31.098
I had to be willing to do
whatever it takes.

05:31.198 --> 05:33.867
Do whatever it takes, okay.

05:34.868 --> 05:36.637
I'll tell you a secret,

05:36.737 --> 05:39.940
I quit my family's company
for this job.

05:40.040 --> 05:41.409
Wow.
Yeah.

05:41.509 --> 05:43.343
Wow.
(chuckles)

05:43.444 --> 05:45.379
This Thanksgiving,
I'm gonna be eating KFC

05:45.479 --> 05:46.680
alone in my apartment.

05:46.780 --> 05:48.982
But when I'm crying
into that bucket,

05:49.082 --> 05:50.718
I'll still be winning.

05:52.252 --> 05:54.622
Christina,
that must've been scary.

05:54.722 --> 05:56.189
It was.

05:56.289 --> 05:59.493
But I faced my fear
and I overcame it.

05:59.593 --> 06:02.763
That sounds like the subject
for another memo.

06:02.863 --> 06:05.933
Oh, my God. Yes.

06:06.834 --> 06:08.268
Excuse me.

06:08.368 --> 06:10.337
You forgot to set this table.

06:13.106 --> 06:15.476
After working a double,

06:15.576 --> 06:17.678
those jets feel
so good on my feet.

06:17.778 --> 06:20.147
Mm-hmm.
My back has been killing me.

06:20.247 --> 06:22.049
'Cause you been on
your feet all day.

06:22.149 --> 06:24.718
Because I was
on my back all night.

06:24.818 --> 06:28.155
Wait until I tell you
what happened yesterday.

06:28.255 --> 06:30.524
Oh, is this the
Dr. Chakraborty story?

06:30.624 --> 06:33.627
This is great. You guys
are gonna love it.

06:33.727 --> 06:35.262
We were scrubbing in
for surgery...
BOTH: Mm-hmm.

06:35.362 --> 06:37.465
and then he takes
a personal call.

06:37.565 --> 06:38.899
It wasn't even
an emergency,

06:38.999 --> 06:40.868
it was his
girlfriend Cheryl.
Mm-hmm.

06:40.968 --> 06:42.102
Cheryl from the gift shop?

06:42.202 --> 06:44.805
Yep. Apparently,
they're a thing.

06:44.905 --> 06:45.939
No.
ABISHOLA: Yes.

06:46.039 --> 06:46.974
It's been going on for, like...

06:47.074 --> 06:48.141
For three months.

06:48.809 --> 06:51.178
Sorry. I should let
you tell the story.

06:51.278 --> 06:52.446
You have told it all.

06:52.546 --> 06:54.214
Well, not the part
where they spent

06:54.314 --> 06:56.750
a steamy weekend
in Cleveland together.

06:58.085 --> 06:59.987
You go.

07:03.423 --> 07:06.093
They were in Cleveland together.

07:06.193 --> 07:07.561
It's boring
the way you tell it.

07:07.661 --> 07:09.396
Bob, please continue.

07:10.230 --> 07:11.131
You guys ready for this?

07:11.231 --> 07:12.299
Mm-hmm.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

07:12.399 --> 07:13.366
Rumor has it,
Cheryl's pregnant.

07:13.467 --> 07:15.703
BOTH:
(gasp) Ooh, no!

07:15.803 --> 07:17.505
Yes. She's going
from gift shop clerk

07:17.605 --> 07:19.807
to the thoracic surgeon
baby mama.

07:19.907 --> 07:23.176
Ooh...
Now, that is how
you tell a story!

07:23.276 --> 07:25.378
Spill that tea, sock man.

07:26.880 --> 07:28.482
(chuckles weakly)

07:30.083 --> 07:31.451
So, when I left
the company,

07:31.552 --> 07:34.555
my mother said
I was dead to her.
(groans)

07:34.655 --> 07:37.791
But you know what? Right now,
I feel more alive than ever.

07:37.891 --> 07:38.726
(chuckles)

07:38.826 --> 07:41.061
But it's still kind of sad

07:41.161 --> 07:42.996
that you don't have her support,

07:43.096 --> 07:46.767
that she's not proud
of all your success.

07:46.867 --> 07:49.036
No. It's not sad.

07:49.136 --> 07:50.971
It's just life.

07:52.339 --> 07:54.742
So, where you from?

07:55.709 --> 07:57.344
Toronto.

07:57.444 --> 08:00.080
Ooh. Exotic.
(chuckles)

08:00.180 --> 08:02.583
(Canadian accent):
Hey, where's that
Canadian accent, eh?

08:02.683 --> 08:04.652
(laughs)

08:05.986 --> 08:07.454
I moved here when I was six.

08:07.555 --> 08:09.222
Kids in school
kind of beat it out of me.

08:09.322 --> 08:11.659
(American accent):
Aw...

08:11.759 --> 08:15.395
We can be so cruel
to our immigrants.

08:17.064 --> 08:18.999
I apologize for saying "eh".

08:19.967 --> 08:21.535
It's all right.

08:21.635 --> 08:23.537
(sighs):
Okay.

08:23.637 --> 08:25.639
So, um, what do you think--

08:25.739 --> 08:28.241
should we get another round?

08:28.341 --> 08:30.544
Or maybe--

08:30.644 --> 08:32.980
and I'm taking a chance here--

08:33.080 --> 08:35.415
have a nightcap at my place?

08:35.515 --> 08:37.384
Okay, Jared.

08:37.484 --> 08:43.056
I had a feeling we might be
headed in that direction, um...

08:43.156 --> 08:44.625
But lesson number one:

08:44.725 --> 08:46.627
when you scale
the corporate ladder,

08:46.727 --> 08:49.763
you don't mix the personal
with the business.

08:53.601 --> 08:55.335
Can't blame me for trying.

08:55.435 --> 08:57.237
No, I cannot.

08:58.105 --> 09:00.240
And you haven't even
seen me naked.

09:00.340 --> 09:02.475
(chuckles)

09:11.084 --> 09:13.220
That was fun, huh?
Yes.

09:13.320 --> 09:15.589
You had a good time.

09:15.689 --> 09:17.825
I'm all done here.
You want to watch a movie?

09:17.925 --> 09:20.027
Mm, I think
I'm going to go and read.

09:20.127 --> 09:21.829
Oh, okay.

09:23.096 --> 09:24.231
What are you doing?

09:24.331 --> 09:25.599
Well, you read,

09:25.699 --> 09:27.200
I'll watch the iPad
right next to you.

09:27.300 --> 09:29.102
Everybody wins.

09:29.202 --> 09:31.071
Oh.

09:31.171 --> 09:33.140
What's the matter?
(sighs)

09:33.240 --> 09:34.374
I do not want to offend you.

09:34.474 --> 09:36.409
Don't worry about it.
What's up?

09:36.509 --> 09:38.846
I have been at the hospital
all day

09:38.946 --> 09:40.848
and we've spent
every moment together

09:40.948 --> 09:42.549
since I got home.

09:42.650 --> 09:44.251
I need a little space.

09:44.351 --> 09:46.019
Got it.

09:48.922 --> 09:49.890
You are offended.

09:49.990 --> 09:51.091
No, I'm not.

09:52.192 --> 09:53.694
I actually want some space, too.

09:53.794 --> 09:55.663
Good.
Enjoy your movie.

09:59.532 --> 10:03.336
TV HOST:
And welcome to Fact or Fiction.
(phone rings)

10:03.436 --> 10:05.305
I'm your host, Bob Baker.

10:05.405 --> 10:06.606
Hello, Bob.

10:06.707 --> 10:07.775
What are you doing tomorrow?

10:07.875 --> 10:09.509
What are we doing tomorrow?

10:09.609 --> 10:11.578
Eh, my sister wants
to go fabric shopping.

10:11.679 --> 10:14.114
I'm not doing anything.

10:15.015 --> 10:16.249
Let's go fishing.

10:16.349 --> 10:18.085
Oh, have you learned
how to drive the boat?

10:18.185 --> 10:20.387
Nope, but if I can
drive my wife crazy,

10:20.487 --> 10:22.555
I can certainly drive a boat.

10:22.656 --> 10:25.458
Wonderful.
See you then.

10:25.558 --> 10:27.260
(TV continues indistinctly)

10:27.360 --> 10:28.595
What's going on?

10:28.696 --> 10:31.298
Uh, Bob is having problems
in his marriage,

10:31.398 --> 10:33.967
so I get to go fishing.

10:44.077 --> 10:45.713
(snorts softly)

10:47.080 --> 10:48.515
Morning, boss.

10:49.516 --> 10:50.951
Hi.

10:51.919 --> 10:54.587
This was certainly not the plan.

10:54.688 --> 10:57.657
No. Certainly not.

10:59.392 --> 11:00.928
Regrets?

11:01.028 --> 11:03.230
Yeah, maybe.
(chuckles)

11:03.330 --> 11:06.633
I can't help feeling
like I'm a bad mentor.

11:06.734 --> 11:08.702
Oh, I disagree.

11:08.802 --> 11:12.539
You taught me quite a bit
last night.

11:13.540 --> 11:16.443
I should go.

11:16.543 --> 11:18.545
Are you sure?
You can hang out for a while.

11:18.645 --> 11:20.480
My mom's making pancakes.

11:21.381 --> 11:22.850
Your-your mom?

11:22.950 --> 11:25.218
What, is she visiting
from out of town?

11:26.553 --> 11:28.756
No. No.
Of course she's not.

11:34.728 --> 11:36.930
This is wonderful.
Thank you for the invitation.

11:37.030 --> 11:38.098
You're welcome.

11:38.899 --> 11:41.068
Would you like to talk about
your marital strife?

11:41.168 --> 11:42.435
No, thank you.

11:42.535 --> 11:43.771
Good.

11:50.210 --> 11:52.179
You know, a lot of women
would be very grateful

11:52.279 --> 11:54.214
to have a husband
waiting on 'em hand and foot.

11:54.314 --> 11:56.416
So we are talking about it.

11:57.450 --> 11:59.987
I'm fine with
her friends busting my chops,

12:00.087 --> 12:02.155
but I expected more from her.

12:02.255 --> 12:05.258
Oh! Here we go! Olu will be
eating fresh fish tonight.

12:05.358 --> 12:07.761
(chuckles)
No.

12:09.696 --> 12:11.331
Tell the truth--
do you think I made a mistake

12:11.431 --> 12:13.500
stepping back from MaxDot?

12:13.600 --> 12:15.202
I think you did
what you needed to do

12:15.302 --> 12:17.037
to be happy.
Exactly.

12:17.137 --> 12:19.139
Which was a mistake.

12:19.239 --> 12:20.707
Never mind.
Bob,

12:20.808 --> 12:23.543
you married a traditional
Nigerian woman.

12:24.411 --> 12:25.612
She was brought up
to believe that

12:25.712 --> 12:27.114
if her husband
is home all the time,

12:27.214 --> 12:29.817
he is either lazy
or close to death.

12:29.917 --> 12:33.420
Well, maybe what she was
brought up to believe is wrong.
(short chuckle)

12:33.520 --> 12:34.521
Interesting.

12:34.621 --> 12:36.890
Tell her that,
see what happens.

12:36.990 --> 12:38.491
Maybe I will.

12:39.960 --> 12:41.194
Uh, w-what are you doing?

12:41.294 --> 12:42.662
I'm gonna tell her.

12:42.762 --> 12:43.797
No, I did not mean now.

12:43.897 --> 12:45.265
I-I want to catch a fish.

12:45.365 --> 12:47.100
Well, we can stop at the market
on the way home.

12:47.200 --> 12:48.435
Nobody needs to know.

12:49.269 --> 12:50.403
(motor sputters)

12:50.503 --> 12:51.939
Uh-oh.

12:52.039 --> 12:53.240
What is it?

12:53.340 --> 12:54.707
There's something wrong
with this thing.

12:54.808 --> 12:56.643
(motor sputters)

12:57.644 --> 12:58.912
Oh, why?

12:59.012 --> 13:02.315
Perhaps God is trying
to save your marriage.

13:02.415 --> 13:04.885
That's cute.
That's very cute.

13:04.985 --> 13:06.553
(motor sputters)

13:07.720 --> 13:08.822
(groans)

13:08.922 --> 13:10.657
(phone rings)

13:10.757 --> 13:12.425
Christina Wheeler.

13:12.525 --> 13:15.562
HR?
Why do they want to see me?

13:16.729 --> 13:19.599
Yeah.
I didn't file a complaint.

13:23.536 --> 13:25.238
Oh.

13:30.878 --> 13:32.745
Oh.

13:33.780 --> 13:34.848
Oh, God. Oh, God.

13:34.948 --> 13:36.116
Oh, God. Oh, God.

13:36.216 --> 13:37.650
Really, Jared?

13:37.750 --> 13:40.653
You told them I coerced you?
You said

13:40.753 --> 13:43.891
to do whatever it takes.

13:43.991 --> 13:47.527
Not to me, to other people!

13:48.428 --> 13:49.696
For what it's worth...

13:50.998 --> 13:54.267
...you're a really good mentor.

13:55.135 --> 13:56.336
Well, for what it's worth,

13:56.436 --> 13:57.871
the only good thing

13:57.971 --> 14:00.908
about hooking up with you
was your mother's pancakes.

14:06.846 --> 14:08.281
(elevator dings)

14:31.939 --> 14:34.341
(footsteps approaching)

14:41.248 --> 14:42.849
There she is.

14:42.950 --> 14:44.317
Ah, Christina.

14:44.417 --> 14:46.987
How do you find your way
out of here every day?

14:47.087 --> 14:48.055
(chuckles)

14:48.155 --> 14:49.289
What are you doing here?

14:49.389 --> 14:51.424
Oh, I just had a free afternoon.

14:51.524 --> 14:54.361
You know,
for the rest of my life.

14:55.162 --> 14:57.097
Are you drunk?
Don't worry.

14:57.197 --> 14:58.131
I Ubered.

14:58.231 --> 14:59.332
I may be a sexual predator,

14:59.432 --> 15:01.334
but I am not irresponsible.

15:01.434 --> 15:02.769
Boop.
(laughs)

15:03.603 --> 15:05.638
What are you talking about?
(sighs)

15:05.738 --> 15:07.074
I was terminated

15:07.174 --> 15:09.509
for having inappropriate
sexual relations

15:09.609 --> 15:11.244
with a "subordinant."

15:11.344 --> 15:13.213
No.

15:13.313 --> 15:16.549
Yeah, it was a big
whoopsie for me.

15:16.649 --> 15:17.917
So, what do you want to do--
want to get out of here,

15:18.018 --> 15:19.019
go see a movie?

15:19.119 --> 15:20.387
I am working.

15:20.487 --> 15:22.389
Have you called Bob
or your mother?

15:22.489 --> 15:24.224
I can't, they hate me.

15:24.324 --> 15:25.592
No, they do not.

15:25.692 --> 15:29.062
You're the only one
who still loves me.

15:29.162 --> 15:31.431
Okay...

15:31.531 --> 15:34.034
You do love me, right?

15:34.134 --> 15:36.536
(sighs) Of course.

15:37.337 --> 15:38.905
Say it.

15:39.006 --> 15:41.174
Christina, I am working.

15:41.274 --> 15:43.143
Oh, God.

15:43.243 --> 15:45.912
You hate me, too.
What's going on?

15:46.013 --> 15:47.981
I'm a monster!

15:51.218 --> 15:53.420
Where's the damn Coast Guard?

15:53.520 --> 15:55.288
Coast Guard is for oceans.

15:55.388 --> 15:56.856
We are in a lake.

15:56.956 --> 15:59.126
Well, then where's
the Lake Guard?

15:59.926 --> 16:02.562
Did you check to see
if we are out of gas?

16:06.266 --> 16:08.101
Uh, yeah, we're good.

16:08.201 --> 16:09.236
I would like to look.

16:09.336 --> 16:11.038
Okay, we're out of gas.

16:11.871 --> 16:13.873
Did you not think to check
before we left?

16:13.973 --> 16:16.209
I thought when I bought the boat
it came with a full tank.

16:16.309 --> 16:17.810
That's not unreasonable.

16:17.910 --> 16:19.946
No. Just stupid.

16:20.747 --> 16:23.450
All right, let's not turn on
each other till we get hungry.

16:23.550 --> 16:26.119
(sighs)
I want to go home.

16:26.219 --> 16:27.420
Yeah. Me too.

16:27.520 --> 16:29.556
My wife loves me.

16:29.656 --> 16:31.858
My wife does, too.

16:31.958 --> 16:34.027
Sometimes.

16:39.199 --> 16:40.933
Can I ask you a question?

16:41.034 --> 16:45.004
If it's gonna make me feel dumb,
I'm already there.

16:45.105 --> 16:47.474
Why did you buy this boat?

16:48.508 --> 16:50.377
'Cause I earned it.

16:50.477 --> 16:52.079
I deserve nice things.

16:52.179 --> 16:53.880
Is it making you happy?

16:53.980 --> 16:55.515
Not at the moment, no.

16:56.283 --> 16:58.785
When was the last time
you were happy?

16:58.885 --> 17:00.953
I know where you're going
with this, Tunde.

17:01.054 --> 17:02.089
You can stop.

17:02.189 --> 17:03.656
It was not on a lake,

17:03.756 --> 17:05.525
and certainly not
sitting in a jacuzzi

17:05.625 --> 17:07.294
with your wife's girlfriends.

17:07.394 --> 17:09.062
You heard about that?

17:09.162 --> 17:12.099
I wish I had not.

17:12.199 --> 17:14.000
Bob,

17:14.101 --> 17:16.869
I believe the last time
you were truly happy

17:16.969 --> 17:19.272
was sitting
at your father's desk,

17:19.372 --> 17:21.007
selling socks.

17:22.575 --> 17:25.578
You trying to get me
to jump overboard?

17:26.446 --> 17:28.047
You have a gift, Bob.

17:28.148 --> 17:29.516
Selling socks?

17:29.616 --> 17:32.519
Well, it's not a very glamorous
or sexy gift,

17:32.619 --> 17:35.021
some might even call it boring.

17:36.022 --> 17:37.757
But it is yours.

17:38.758 --> 17:40.026
I guess.

17:40.127 --> 17:41.594
Go back to work.

17:41.694 --> 17:43.263
Your wife will like you better.

17:43.363 --> 17:44.931
You will like you better.

17:45.031 --> 17:46.966
I will like you...

17:47.066 --> 17:48.368
about the same.

17:48.468 --> 17:50.270
Thanks, Tunde.

17:50.370 --> 17:51.971
Yeah.
What are you doing?

17:52.071 --> 17:54.974
Eh, maybe there is
a flare gun in here

17:55.074 --> 17:58.578
and we can signal for help.
Good idea.

18:01.714 --> 18:04.551
This appears to be
a container of gasoline.

18:04.651 --> 18:06.553
Oh, cool, we're saved.

18:06.653 --> 18:08.388
How could you not know
this was here?

18:08.488 --> 18:10.123
I didn't even know
that seat lifted up.

18:15.027 --> 18:16.629
If anybody asks,

18:16.729 --> 18:19.232
you are here because
of a medical emergency.

18:19.332 --> 18:21.768
My life is over!

18:21.868 --> 18:23.536
Very good.

18:23.636 --> 18:25.472
Actually, her blood pressure's
pretty high.

18:25.572 --> 18:28.241
Here, have a Jell-O
and try and forget

18:28.341 --> 18:29.509
that you threw your career away

18:29.609 --> 18:31.578
for a man
who lives with his mother.

18:32.579 --> 18:34.647
Thanks for taking care of me.

18:34.747 --> 18:37.150
You girls are my best friends.

18:37.250 --> 18:38.651
Hmm. That's strange.

18:38.751 --> 18:41.488
You are barely
an acquaintance to me.

18:42.155 --> 18:44.557
We have to go back to work now.
Will you be okay?

18:44.657 --> 18:47.093
Oh, sure, go ahead.

18:47.194 --> 18:49.229
I'm used to being alone.

18:49.329 --> 18:50.930
Good.

18:52.732 --> 18:55.435
Christina, I don't know
what else to do for you.

18:55.535 --> 18:57.804
Give her some
words of encouragement.

18:59.906 --> 19:01.774
This mistake you have
made is just one of

19:01.874 --> 19:03.510
the many mistakes
in your life,

19:03.610 --> 19:05.945
and you will make many more.

19:06.045 --> 19:07.847
Oh, God.

19:07.947 --> 19:10.217
Maybe try some different words.

19:11.017 --> 19:14.354
You are a resilient
and determined woman.

19:14.454 --> 19:15.622
And I know that before long

19:15.722 --> 19:17.524
you'll put all of
this behind you.

19:18.325 --> 19:20.193
My LinkedIn page has an alert

19:20.293 --> 19:22.161
for sexual misconduct.

19:22.262 --> 19:25.765
Perhaps you'll put it behind
you in a different country.

19:27.133 --> 19:29.236
You will find a way.

19:29.336 --> 19:31.170
I believe in you.

19:31.971 --> 19:34.173
Thank you so much
for saying that.

19:34.274 --> 19:35.308
Okay.

19:35.408 --> 19:36.943
Hug?

19:40.447 --> 19:43.115
Oh, her blood pressure's
coming down.

19:43.216 --> 19:45.352
There's my poor baby.

19:45.452 --> 19:46.753
You called my mother?

19:46.853 --> 19:49.756
Oh, her blood pressure's
going back up.

19:49.856 --> 19:51.157
Oh, God.

19:58.265 --> 20:01.401
(sighs)
Here's your coffee, honey.

20:01.501 --> 20:02.735
Thank you.

20:02.835 --> 20:04.103
Are you cold?
You look cold.

20:04.203 --> 20:05.272
I'm fine.

20:05.372 --> 20:06.806
No, you're not.
You're cold.

20:08.375 --> 20:10.643
I'm surprised you're not
ripping me a new one.

20:10.743 --> 20:13.746
Maybe later, when you're feeling
a little better about yourself.

20:13.846 --> 20:17.116
You know, you're the reason
I left MaxDot.

20:17.216 --> 20:19.486
I know,
and if it helps to blame me,

20:19.586 --> 20:21.654
I can take it.

20:21.754 --> 20:23.890
No, I screwed up.

20:23.990 --> 20:26.158
It's all my fault.

20:26.259 --> 20:27.560
It's society's fault.

20:27.660 --> 20:29.262
Call me old-fashioned,

20:29.362 --> 20:31.598
but mutually-consenting
coworkers

20:31.698 --> 20:34.267
ought to be able
to hump one another.

20:35.067 --> 20:37.637
You'd think so, right?
Oh,

20:37.737 --> 20:39.406
you'll get through this.

20:39.506 --> 20:42.141
Doesn't feel like it.
Oh, you will.

20:42.241 --> 20:44.844
And I'll be with you
every step of the way.

20:46.779 --> 20:48.147
I love you, Mom.

20:48.247 --> 20:50.517
I love you, too, sweetie.

20:51.751 --> 20:53.052
(sighs)

20:53.152 --> 20:54.387
So, did you use protection

20:54.487 --> 20:56.756
or am I gonna finally
get that grandbaby?
