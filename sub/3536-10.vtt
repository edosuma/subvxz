WEBVTT

00:01.160 --> 00:03.263
Carroll was convicted in 2004

00:03.380 --> 00:05.554
for the murders
of 14 young women.

00:05.653 --> 00:08.209
The warden granted Joe
Carroll's request for a transfer.

00:08.303 --> 00:08.985
He's leaving.

00:09.071 --> 00:10.509
Joe's not in the
transport vehicle.

00:10.604 --> 00:11.580
Where the hell is he?

00:13.333 --> 00:15.521
So Joe's free,
and now I get locked up.

00:15.618 --> 00:17.421
Protective custody.
Better if I don't know.

00:17.525 --> 00:20.292
Hey. Morning. I know
you're scared of me,

00:20.393 --> 00:21.771
but I hope that will change.

00:21.871 --> 00:24.347
My son needs a mother.

00:24.438 --> 00:25.850
And I have an idea
how we can find her.

00:25.956 --> 00:27.448
She has to die

00:27.554 --> 00:29.534
because you slept
with Joe's wife.

00:29.619 --> 00:31.078
Why did you do it?

00:31.252 --> 00:32.461
Because I love her.

00:32.566 --> 00:34.713
Nick Donovan made an
encrypted cell phone call

00:34.821 --> 00:36.492
checking the status
of Claire Matthews.

00:36.591 --> 00:38.410
Your wife is
in Huntington County.

00:39.516 --> 00:40.958
What's taking her so long?

00:41.081 --> 00:41.945
I looked all over the place!

00:42.048 --> 00:43.030
She and Joey are both gone!

00:43.191 --> 00:44.453
Aah!

00:44.733 --> 00:46.461
Emma, why did you leave us?

00:46.549 --> 00:48.346
If you don't get
him to a hospital immediately,

00:48.431 --> 00:49.279
he's going to die.

00:49.376 --> 00:50.490
You can do this.

00:51.591 --> 00:52.866
I'm sorry.

00:52.940 --> 00:54.700
Earlier I received
a very exciting e-mail.

00:54.808 --> 00:55.971
I wanted to tell you about it,

00:56.067 --> 00:57.569
but I thought I'd surprise you.

00:59.000 --> 01:05.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:17.313 --> 01:19.042
Man, you're a heavy sleeper.

01:22.469 --> 01:25.635
Get up. You don't want
to sleep the day away.

01:29.574 --> 01:30.803
What are you doing here?

01:30.908 --> 01:32.696
I'm trying to get you up.

01:32.878 --> 01:35.037
Now go. Come on.
Get in the shower.

01:36.423 --> 01:38.543
Come on. You're gonna
miss breakfast.

02:08.821 --> 02:10.527
Aah!

02:18.297 --> 02:21.403
Sync and corrections by n17t01
www.addic7ed.com

02:21.503 --> 02:23.365
And now an update
from Richmond, Virginia.

02:23.479 --> 02:24.623
A press conference this morning

02:24.720 --> 02:26.302
has not eased
our nation's paranoia

02:26.429 --> 02:29.282
as we've learned that
FBI, CIA, and NSA

02:29.405 --> 02:31.341
are now all in pursuit
of Joe Carroll

02:31.459 --> 02:32.820
and his cult of serial killers.

02:32.916 --> 02:34.392
Amanda Porter's
not exactly talking.

02:35.118 --> 02:36.893
No. I take that back.

02:37.033 --> 02:38.725
She's actually saying a lot.

02:39.265 --> 02:40.526
And what does she say?

02:40.613 --> 02:41.592
Well, let's see.

02:41.693 --> 02:42.962
Uh, she's a pisces.

02:43.051 --> 02:44.615
Favorite movie is
the "Notebook,"

02:44.725 --> 02:46.209
she's an advocate
for the death penalty.

02:46.328 --> 02:48.776
She believes in creationism
over evolution,

02:48.875 --> 02:50.759
enjoys seventies soft rock,

02:50.861 --> 02:52.446
and hates peanut butter,
whole milk,

02:52.548 --> 02:53.633
and Anne Hathaway.

02:53.746 --> 02:54.806
They got to let me talk to her.

02:54.923 --> 02:56.881
I agree,
but it's DC's show now.

02:56.985 --> 02:58.438
I mean, it's their call.

02:59.324 --> 03:01.629
Hey. You got to let me
talk to Amanda Porter.

03:01.736 --> 03:02.847
It's not going to happen, Ryan.

03:02.951 --> 03:04.897
Come on.
This woman knows me.

03:04.999 --> 03:06.201
I broke her once already.

03:06.313 --> 03:07.724
He's right.
He should be there.

03:07.849 --> 03:09.109
If the DC guys can't break her,

03:09.226 --> 03:10.847
I'll recommend it, okay?

03:11.289 --> 03:12.660
We got another problem.

03:12.759 --> 03:15.233
Quantico found a portal
break in their server.

03:15.372 --> 03:16.082
We were hacked?

03:16.187 --> 03:17.403
- Where was their failsafe?
- It stalled.

03:17.520 --> 03:19.255
The optical lines were
interrupted for several seconds.

03:19.353 --> 03:20.535
With a worm encrypted
with a virus

03:20.654 --> 03:21.675
just like at the farmhouse.

03:21.766 --> 03:22.470
What did they access?

03:22.582 --> 03:24.214
Telecommunications log,
specifically phone calls

03:24.268 --> 03:26.051
to the Protective
Custody Division.

03:26.162 --> 03:27.635
It's possible Joe made
an attempt to trace

03:27.738 --> 03:30.164
Claire Matthews' location
via our satellite system.

03:30.257 --> 03:31.128
We got to move her right now.

03:31.224 --> 03:32.629
Yes, we do, but we need you

03:32.730 --> 03:34.303
to convince her of that.

03:34.443 --> 03:35.502
Will you call her?

03:36.035 --> 03:38.871
Using what phone exactly?

03:38.971 --> 03:39.844
No. I want to do it
in person.

03:39.933 --> 03:41.223
You got to get me a chopper,
and from now on,

03:41.324 --> 03:42.976
I want to be in charge
of her safety detail.

03:43.066 --> 03:43.798
Like hell you will!

03:43.934 --> 03:44.595
Nick, let him go.

03:44.671 --> 03:45.886
He's not an agent, Debra!

03:45.976 --> 03:47.329
It's nonnegotiable.

03:49.759 --> 03:51.042
The cell tower
linked to your wife

03:51.137 --> 03:53.758
is near a Roadside
Motel on Highway 31.

03:53.877 --> 03:56.176
Typically there's
5-6 agents per safe house

03:56.307 --> 03:59.080
in a designated area
away from the other guests.

03:59.167 --> 04:00.430
I'm thinking an M17

04:00.537 --> 04:02.936
or my micro-Uzi
with a silencer.

04:04.625 --> 04:06.231
You ex-military?

04:06.329 --> 04:08.419
Hell, no.
We're better than that.

04:08.523 --> 04:10.266
They were both
raised by militia.

04:10.358 --> 04:13.442
Constitutional extremists to...

04:13.533 --> 04:15.239
to be accurate.

04:16.822 --> 04:18.336
You sure about this?

04:18.454 --> 04:19.706
You want your wife back,

04:19.865 --> 04:21.512
these two can do it.

04:21.596 --> 04:22.624
They've got the skills

04:22.722 --> 04:24.105
and the know-how.

04:26.850 --> 04:29.190
You go with them, Roderick.

04:30.093 --> 04:31.418
I can't.

04:31.516 --> 04:32.755
I got to work today.

04:32.831 --> 04:34.095
Duty calls.

04:34.341 --> 04:36.977
Oh, I'm sure
you'll work it out.

04:37.108 --> 04:38.770
I'm sure I can't.

04:40.950 --> 04:42.950
I insist, Roderick.

04:43.192 --> 04:45.303
You've failed twice.

04:45.412 --> 04:47.995
This time, I want my wife.

05:02.332 --> 05:03.280
Jacob!

05:03.388 --> 05:05.036
Hey, squirt!

05:06.749 --> 05:07.948
Ohh!

05:08.156 --> 05:09.602
How you doing?

05:10.030 --> 05:11.812
Look! Jacob's here!

05:12.360 --> 05:13.118
Hey, Jacob.

05:13.230 --> 05:14.254
When did you get here?

05:14.380 --> 05:15.661
W-w-where's Paul?

05:15.769 --> 05:17.119
I got here late last night,

05:17.365 --> 05:19.505
and Paul, well--

05:20.571 --> 05:22.212
Paul couldn't make it.

05:22.322 --> 05:25.342
Hey. Joey, will you give
Jacob and me a minute?

05:26.436 --> 05:28.222
It's okay, dude.
We don't need a minute.

05:28.360 --> 05:30.420
Jacob, let me explain,
let me talk to you.

05:34.323 --> 05:36.124
Look at this place.

05:36.236 --> 05:37.604
Will you show me around, buddy?
Will you do that?

05:37.735 --> 05:38.781
Sure!

05:38.911 --> 05:40.690
Come on. Let's go.

05:43.463 --> 05:46.266
_

06:00.602 --> 06:02.715
When is Ryan Hardy
getting here?

06:07.051 --> 06:09.781
Okay. Good.
He's pulling up now.

06:10.442 --> 06:12.890
All right. Thanks.

06:33.631 --> 06:35.950
Ryan Hardy?
I'm Marshal Ferguson.

06:36.066 --> 06:37.359
Claire's in the next room.

06:40.991 --> 06:42.871
- Hey.
- Hey.

06:50.192 --> 06:52.201
Nobody's telling me the truth.

06:53.514 --> 06:55.512
What do you want to know?
I'll tell you anything.

06:55.895 --> 07:00.005
Uh, for starters, why was
I denied media access?

07:01.443 --> 07:04.439
Joe's people were targeting
women named Claire Matthews

07:04.564 --> 07:05.989
in the Richmond area,

07:06.087 --> 07:09.049
and two of them were killed.

07:09.471 --> 07:11.373
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

07:11.476 --> 07:14.816
I just-- I don't understand
why no one can find him.

07:14.922 --> 07:17.471
I mean, how does a cult of
killers stay hidden this long?

07:17.572 --> 07:20.540
His followers have proven
to be sophisticated.

07:20.630 --> 07:22.823
Their tactical skills,
cyberinvasion,

07:22.916 --> 07:24.065
they're on a terrorist level,

07:24.158 --> 07:27.221
plus some of them
are trained military.

07:27.318 --> 07:29.016
And now he's with Joey.

07:29.578 --> 07:31.973
That madman has my son.

07:33.506 --> 07:36.019
We need to move you
someplace safer.

07:44.880 --> 07:46.003
Those are cool shades.

07:46.102 --> 07:47.535
Where'd you get those?

07:50.880 --> 07:51.669
I've got two subjects

07:51.766 --> 07:53.013
going through the lobby now.

07:53.392 --> 07:55.003
Be advised it looks like they're
headed for the stairway,

07:55.104 --> 07:56.984
possibly the elevator
at this time.

08:13.231 --> 08:14.706
Whole wing is locked down.

08:15.560 --> 08:16.997
They're somewhere
in this hallway.

08:17.095 --> 08:18.310
I got the master key.

08:18.400 --> 08:19.922
See you on the other side.

08:27.091 --> 08:28.487
Do a walk-through.

08:28.605 --> 08:29.630
Let me know when it's clear.

08:29.753 --> 08:31.044
Yes, sir.
You got it.

08:32.171 --> 08:33.131
Where's Claire?

08:33.265 --> 08:34.784
I'm right here.
I'm ready.

08:36.068 --> 08:38.437
Hey. Is there a
problem out there?

08:38.544 --> 08:41.590
My men in the lobby saw a couple
guys that looked suspicious.

08:50.606 --> 08:52.173
Let's do this.

08:56.362 --> 08:58.049
No screw-ups.

09:22.204 --> 09:23.752
Clear.

09:29.836 --> 09:31.560
You and Claire go out the back.
I got you covered.

09:31.673 --> 09:32.869
Okay. Stay with me.

09:35.882 --> 09:37.164
Okay. Come on.

09:38.165 --> 09:39.406
Clear.

09:57.748 --> 09:58.765
Come on.

10:09.402 --> 10:10.637
Get in.

10:11.583 --> 10:13.379
- Aah!
- Come here!

10:13.522 --> 10:14.772
Ohh!

10:15.536 --> 10:17.189
Back off.
Drop the gun.

10:17.397 --> 10:18.735
Or what?

10:19.119 --> 10:20.640
You're not gonna shoot her.

10:26.359 --> 10:27.425
Okay. Come on.

10:27.515 --> 10:29.351
Come on! We got to go! Come on!

10:32.287 --> 10:34.550
Damn. That hurt.

10:56.186 --> 10:57.354
Do you have a cell phone?

10:57.450 --> 10:58.320
No.

10:58.400 --> 10:59.767
Take out the SIM card.

11:03.865 --> 11:05.254
Where are we going?

11:11.309 --> 11:12.789
Someplace safe.

11:20.876 --> 11:22.820
I don't understand.
Where is he?

11:22.934 --> 11:24.721
I don't know. He
destroyed his SIM card,

11:24.836 --> 11:26.961
deactivated the GPS on his car.

11:27.475 --> 11:28.889
He's being smart.

11:29.055 --> 11:30.221
He's worried
about being traced,

11:30.361 --> 11:31.737
so he must have Claire.

11:32.350 --> 11:33.234
Where would they go?

11:33.300 --> 11:35.239
Brooklyn is
a 4-hour drive.

11:35.573 --> 11:37.869
Have an undercover patrol
his place in Brooklyn.

11:37.941 --> 11:38.698
You think he went home?

11:38.788 --> 11:40.614
Hey! FBI
surveillance footage is in.

11:40.701 --> 11:42.115
There's a total
of 4 dead at the scene,

11:42.215 --> 11:43.498
including Marshal Ferguson.

11:43.599 --> 11:45.220
I have face recognition.

11:45.365 --> 11:46.565
Let's get IDs.

11:46.652 --> 11:48.806
We need find them
before they find Hardy.

11:52.390 --> 11:55.710
_

12:10.181 --> 12:11.180
Is this the place?

12:11.284 --> 12:12.504
I hope so.

12:13.592 --> 12:15.693
I'm looking for a guy
named Tyson.

12:16.400 --> 12:19.519
Ha ha! What the hell
are you doing here?

12:20.019 --> 12:21.171
Come here.

12:24.653 --> 12:25.566
This is Claire.

12:25.661 --> 12:27.361
- Hey.
- Claire.

12:27.466 --> 12:28.339
Good to meet you.

12:28.452 --> 12:30.802
Yeah. Come on.
Let's go inside.

12:35.669 --> 12:37.567
So how do you
two know each other?

12:37.659 --> 12:39.296
Uh, we went
through Quantico together.

12:39.404 --> 12:41.400
I've been stuck
with ever since.

12:41.486 --> 12:42.984
Tried to get rid of him.

12:43.096 --> 12:44.952
Yeah. I dumped out on the
road a couple of times,

12:45.038 --> 12:46.291
but he found his way back.

12:46.378 --> 12:47.825
Are you still with the Bureau?

12:47.930 --> 12:49.058
I'm no longer an agent.

12:49.189 --> 12:51.435
In fact, I'm no longer alive

12:51.564 --> 12:53.691
thanks to a certain
crime syndicate.

12:53.965 --> 12:56.497
I now live in the wonderful
land of nonexistence.

12:56.603 --> 12:58.739
Tyson's been in Witness
Protection for 4 years.

13:00.352 --> 13:02.200
So you did the right
thing coming here.

13:02.349 --> 13:04.051
This is a safe place.

13:04.562 --> 13:07.592
All right.
Talk to me.

13:08.086 --> 13:09.477
Who's trying to kill you?

13:09.579 --> 13:11.542
3 of Joe's followers
took out a motel

13:11.633 --> 13:15.907
full of federal agents,
but we lost them.

13:16.168 --> 13:18.571
No one's gonna find you here.

13:20.126 --> 13:21.743
Thanks, Ty.

13:21.940 --> 13:23.922
Hey. That's what
friends are for.

13:32.705 --> 13:35.666
Okay. I've
read enough.

13:36.460 --> 13:38.286
You shouldn't do this.

13:38.512 --> 13:40.588
This will make you rich
and famous for 5 minutes,

13:40.716 --> 13:42.482
and then it's gonna
be a bad idea.

13:42.687 --> 13:43.927
Tell me why.

13:44.028 --> 13:45.836
This is gonna define you.

13:46.318 --> 13:48.251
Now you were
a kick-ass agent,

13:48.362 --> 13:49.937
but if you publish this,

13:50.081 --> 13:51.844
you're gonna be that one agent,

13:51.939 --> 13:54.026
the Joe Carroll guy,
forever and always.

13:54.147 --> 13:56.426
What if I told you
I wanted to do it,

13:57.156 --> 14:03.240
that it might help me,
you know, really help me?

14:05.615 --> 14:07.231
Then I say go for it.

14:07.342 --> 14:09.226
What do I know?

14:14.057 --> 14:15.605
I missed you, man.

14:16.298 --> 14:18.263
It's really good to see you.

14:23.933 --> 14:27.099
Wow. This is
a cool room.

14:27.529 --> 14:29.208
I guess. Whatever.

14:29.319 --> 14:31.068
Hey. This place
is awesome.

14:31.289 --> 14:32.431
What? You don't
like it here?

14:32.530 --> 14:35.397
I don't know.
I miss my mom.

14:35.786 --> 14:37.141
Jacob.

14:37.680 --> 14:39.033
How did you sleep?

14:39.574 --> 14:41.761
Morning, Joe.
I slept great.

14:41.846 --> 14:43.115
Good.

14:43.188 --> 14:44.709
Good morning, Joey.

14:45.288 --> 14:47.120
Hey, Joey.
Don't be rude!

14:47.211 --> 14:48.810
No, no.
It's all right.

14:48.952 --> 14:53.106
My son is still, um, adjusting.

14:54.054 --> 14:57.291
Have you-- you get a chance
to have a good look around?

14:57.413 --> 14:59.161
Yeah. Joey gave me
the grand tour.

14:59.267 --> 15:03.148
Good. I'm sure you're going to
be very happy here with us all.

15:04.358 --> 15:09.379
There's just one thing I'd--
I'd like you to do for me.

15:09.609 --> 15:11.327
Yeah, sure.
Anything.

15:11.832 --> 15:13.564
You talk to Emma,

15:14.321 --> 15:17.123
give her a chance to explain
her side of things.

15:17.237 --> 15:18.167
You two need each other.

15:18.268 --> 15:19.256
After what she did--

15:19.342 --> 15:22.508
She was taking care of my son.

15:22.987 --> 15:24.948
She did what was asked of her,

15:25.056 --> 15:28.006
and now I ask a favor of you.

15:28.136 --> 15:31.210
Resolve this,
settle your differences.

15:31.486 --> 15:32.959
You understand?

15:34.801 --> 15:36.390
She left us for dead.

15:36.484 --> 15:39.988
I'm sure that's--
that's how you feel,

15:40.099 --> 15:43.260
but I need you to forgive her.

15:44.146 --> 15:49.340
You love Emma.
I know you do. Okay?

15:55.425 --> 15:59.445
Emma's a selfish bitch,
always was.

16:17.033 --> 16:18.407
Surveillance footage
from the hotel

16:18.523 --> 16:19.986
matched Vincent McKinnley,

16:20.157 --> 16:21.996
wanted in connection
with 3 separate murders

16:22.109 --> 16:23.087
in New York state.

16:23.197 --> 16:24.290
The other one's Brock Wickford.

16:24.377 --> 16:25.544
They're brothers in a sense.

16:25.639 --> 16:26.789
They met in
the juvenile system,

16:26.890 --> 16:28.093
both products of abuse.

16:28.222 --> 16:29.979
They were sent to
a foster care home

16:30.111 --> 16:32.583
that was later busted
for militia activity.

16:32.678 --> 16:34.248
I'm sure they picked up
some great skills there.

16:34.341 --> 16:35.970
I've hacked into
Vincent's e-mail account.

16:36.125 --> 16:37.371
He communicates
internationally,

16:37.485 --> 16:38.809
same as our other cult folks.

16:38.912 --> 16:39.869
I couldn't retrieve
any content,

16:39.972 --> 16:41.677
but I did find
this one sequence

16:41.775 --> 16:43.215
embedded in his e-mails.

16:44.400 --> 16:46.488
What is that, a password?

16:46.657 --> 16:48.390
It could be.
It's meant to be hidden.

16:48.639 --> 16:51.662
Charles Mead had a series
of encrypted URLs.

16:51.765 --> 16:52.974
See if you get lucky.

16:53.156 --> 16:54.109
On it.

16:54.224 --> 16:55.562
Yeah?

16:56.236 --> 16:57.408
Nothing?

16:58.100 --> 16:59.456
Thank you.

17:00.267 --> 17:02.221
Ryan and Claire aren't at
his place in Brooklyn.

17:02.313 --> 17:04.259
They've just completely
disappeared.

17:15.251 --> 17:16.604
Hi.

17:19.470 --> 17:23.269
Joe wanted me to come and
talk to you, so here I am.

17:24.506 --> 17:26.098
Can you sit?

17:40.047 --> 17:41.505
Well?

17:42.413 --> 17:43.895
Okay.

17:47.245 --> 17:48.803
This is hard.

17:49.948 --> 17:51.062
I've been thinking about
what to say to you

17:51.171 --> 17:53.083
since last night.

17:53.562 --> 17:56.409
When you were
surprised to see me?

17:59.914 --> 18:01.761
Did you think I was dead?

18:01.880 --> 18:04.174
No. I don't--
I don't know.

18:04.286 --> 18:05.911
I didn't know what to think.

18:08.957 --> 18:12.877
I'm so sorry about Paul.

18:14.230 --> 18:15.653
I loved him, too.

18:16.127 --> 18:17.768
No, you didn't.

18:18.140 --> 18:19.655
I did.

18:21.769 --> 18:24.935
I know you think
I abandoned you,

18:25.065 --> 18:27.340
and maybe I did, but you
can't just blame me.

18:27.460 --> 18:29.535
I was doing what Roderick
told me to do for Joey.

18:29.636 --> 18:31.876
You didn't have to leave us.

18:31.980 --> 18:35.419
It was crazy that
night, confusing.

18:35.544 --> 18:36.602
I was nearly killed, too.

18:36.711 --> 18:38.743
- I almost lost Joey.
- No, you didn't.

18:39.324 --> 18:42.553
You were fine,
both of you were.

18:42.657 --> 18:44.534
I felt terrible,

18:45.119 --> 18:46.152
but I couldn't go back,

18:46.249 --> 18:47.225
not with all the police,

18:47.324 --> 18:49.150
and Roderick just kept saying,

18:49.259 --> 18:51.816
"move forward,
take Joey home."

18:51.921 --> 18:53.737
You would have
done the same thing.

18:55.547 --> 18:57.344
That's where you're wrong.

18:58.864 --> 19:00.960
Please don't be like this.

19:02.154 --> 19:03.926
I wish I could undo it

19:04.894 --> 19:06.920
and make things right.

19:09.673 --> 19:12.436
I love you, Jacob.

19:13.224 --> 19:15.908
You know that, right?

19:17.881 --> 19:18.877
Where did Ryan go?

19:18.978 --> 19:20.106
He wanted to clean up.

19:22.776 --> 19:24.618
So you guys are pretty close.

19:25.198 --> 19:27.329
I'm not gonna lie.
I know the story.

19:27.910 --> 19:29.448
Yeah.

19:30.222 --> 19:32.835
Or as close as anyone
can get to the man.

19:33.732 --> 19:36.361
He tries really hard
to push you away.

19:36.476 --> 19:38.166
I just refused to budge.

19:38.270 --> 19:39.711
That's how it is with him.

19:39.968 --> 19:41.665
Refuse to budge.

19:43.291 --> 19:47.250
He tries, but he can't
quite bring anyone inside.

19:47.382 --> 19:48.954
You know, it goes further
back than Joe Carroll.

19:49.059 --> 19:50.891
Yeah. I know
about his family.

19:53.293 --> 19:55.210
He tell you
about his death curse?

19:55.309 --> 19:56.812
Yeah.

20:01.075 --> 20:02.656
What about other women?

20:03.254 --> 20:04.919
There were some, yeah.

20:05.064 --> 20:06.994
When he was younger, he
went through them quick,

20:07.115 --> 20:08.686
some good ones, too.

20:09.372 --> 20:11.048
But no one serious?

20:12.794 --> 20:17.232
His last girl-- Molly--
she wanted to be serious.

20:17.348 --> 20:18.520
Sweet girl, too.

20:21.006 --> 20:22.295
That's a good thing.
I don't think--

20:22.400 --> 20:25.152
Excuse me. Hold this for
me, hold this, hold it.

20:25.257 --> 20:26.148
What?

20:26.225 --> 20:29.300
Molly, so nice to
finally meet you.

20:29.400 --> 20:32.229
Aw. You, too,
best friend.

20:32.334 --> 20:33.277
Oh, no, but wait, wait, wait.

20:33.368 --> 20:35.071
Okay. You have to
tell me

20:35.261 --> 20:36.820
what is wrong with this man.

20:36.920 --> 20:37.868
I mean, really.
I need all the dirt

20:37.981 --> 20:40.735
before I invest
any more time in him.

20:40.858 --> 20:43.836
Ryan? Oh.
Cut your losses now.

20:43.978 --> 20:45.759
I'm the better pick.
He's a freak.

20:45.884 --> 20:47.711
Really? How so?

20:47.804 --> 20:48.861
Ooh. Hand puppets.

20:48.988 --> 20:52.809
It's-- it's his hobby,
fetish, whatever.

20:52.925 --> 20:54.110
He makes them out of old socks,

20:54.215 --> 20:55.345
puts on private shows.

20:55.455 --> 20:56.219
It's creepy.

20:56.322 --> 20:58.448
I'll take my chances.

21:00.957 --> 21:02.113
Mm-hmm.

21:11.015 --> 21:12.220
She tried,

21:12.343 --> 21:13.876
held on as long as she could.

21:14.535 --> 21:16.227
You know the drill. Heh.

21:16.829 --> 21:18.300
But let's face it.

21:19.157 --> 21:21.469
If he couldn't go
there with you,

21:22.116 --> 21:24.052
she didn't stand a chance.

21:24.786 --> 21:27.507
So was there ever
anyone serious?

21:27.940 --> 21:30.821
Yeah, Claire. You.

21:34.981 --> 21:37.749
Okay, okay. What lies
are you telling about me now?

21:38.080 --> 21:39.499
Girl talk.
None of your business.

21:39.632 --> 21:41.085
Ah. Is that right?

21:41.280 --> 21:42.747
Ryan.

21:43.604 --> 21:44.888
What is it?

21:44.986 --> 21:46.752
I don't know.
I found it on my sweater.

21:49.511 --> 21:51.119
They must have tagged you

21:51.233 --> 21:53.333
when Joe's guy jumped
you at the motel.

21:54.128 --> 21:55.711
Does that mean they
know we're here?

21:55.810 --> 21:58.251
Yeah, they know.

22:09.853 --> 22:10.909
Ty, I'm really sorry

22:11.020 --> 22:12.456
for bringing my problems
into your home.

22:12.555 --> 22:14.137
I owe the guy.

22:14.409 --> 22:16.633
Ryan has saved my life
more than once,

22:16.741 --> 22:18.092
and he's not one
to ask for help,

22:18.200 --> 22:19.446
so him coming here says a lot.

22:19.545 --> 22:22.422
Hey. I'm glad you came.

22:24.070 --> 22:25.568
Well, if they're out there,

22:25.752 --> 22:26.865
I didn't see them.

22:26.956 --> 22:29.262
I have a state-of-the-art
alarm system out there.

22:29.746 --> 22:31.861
These guys are better
than that, man.

22:31.976 --> 22:34.100
Carrying micro-Uzis
and wearing vests.

22:34.199 --> 22:36.109
Well, we're short on ammo,

22:36.243 --> 22:38.310
so we better make these count,

22:38.540 --> 22:41.974
and this will blow right
through their vests.

22:42.081 --> 22:44.423
We just got to surprise
them with a trick or two.

22:45.191 --> 22:46.718
What'd you have in mind?

22:51.800 --> 22:53.571
I hate Bologna.

22:54.208 --> 22:55.718
I know it's not your favorite,

22:55.872 --> 22:57.716
but I couldn't find
anything else.

22:58.289 --> 23:00.084
Lizzie needs to go shopping.

23:01.058 --> 23:03.530
Who's Lizzie?
Why is she here?

23:03.734 --> 23:05.039
She's a friend of your dad's.

23:05.375 --> 23:07.360
And everyone else,
they're friends, too?

23:07.533 --> 23:09.586
That's right.

23:11.548 --> 23:13.114
Why do they all live here,

23:13.906 --> 23:16.642
and how come my dad's
not in jail anymore?

23:20.461 --> 23:22.484
Maybe you should ask
him that yourself.

23:22.985 --> 23:24.886
I'll be right back, Joey, okay?

23:32.360 --> 23:37.166
Oh. S'mores. S'mores,
s'mores, s'mores, s'mores.

23:39.815 --> 23:41.400
Oh. Hey, Joey.

23:45.511 --> 23:47.009
Don't mind me.

23:54.453 --> 23:56.896
A little chocolate, a little...

23:57.282 --> 23:59.691
chocolate?

23:59.809 --> 24:01.249
You're doing it wrong.

24:01.356 --> 24:02.641
Hmm?

24:03.522 --> 24:04.230
You're supposed to heat

24:04.326 --> 24:06.157
the marshmallows first.

24:07.217 --> 24:09.992
Yes. Yes. Of course.

24:11.108 --> 24:13.413
So, Joey,

24:13.824 --> 24:16.030
there anything
you want to ask me?

24:16.461 --> 24:21.083
You know, I'll tell you
anything you like.

24:22.626 --> 24:24.632
Let me just take those.

24:25.090 --> 24:26.804
You don't break the crackers.

24:26.974 --> 24:29.010
Don't you know how
to make s'mores?

24:29.112 --> 24:30.922
You know, it's, um--

24:31.216 --> 24:33.093
it's-- it's been
a while.

24:33.215 --> 24:37.948
Uh... do you think
you could help me?

24:39.020 --> 24:40.053
I don't know.

24:40.198 --> 24:43.895
Oh. Oh, come on.
I'm dying for s'mores.

24:43.989 --> 24:47.704
It's absolutely
my favorite food.

24:50.488 --> 24:52.355
It's my favorite food, too.

24:52.449 --> 24:53.945
No way!

24:54.048 --> 24:55.924
Is it really yours, too?

24:56.009 --> 24:58.505
Oh, now you've got to show me

24:58.657 --> 25:01.038
because I'm useless.

25:05.899 --> 25:10.861
Okay. Here. Come here.
Jump up.

25:11.005 --> 25:12.502
There we go.

25:13.881 --> 25:15.406
Now.

25:18.141 --> 25:20.305
When am I gonna see my mom?

25:21.527 --> 25:26.048
What if I said
really, really soon?

25:27.042 --> 25:28.886
Yeah. Okay.

25:29.019 --> 25:30.207
Tcch.

25:31.426 --> 25:33.390
Now chocolate, yeah?

25:41.266 --> 25:42.849
Anything?

25:42.948 --> 25:44.965
No. Not yet.

25:45.906 --> 25:47.760
So we just wait?

25:49.706 --> 25:51.550
I want you to stay up
here, lock the door,

25:51.670 --> 25:52.691
barricade yourself in.

25:52.781 --> 25:54.338
We're gonna be
right downstairs.

25:54.466 --> 25:55.871
Are you okay?

25:57.311 --> 25:58.369
I'll be okay when
we're out of here

25:58.489 --> 26:01.773
and when you're safe and
Tyson's safe and Joey's safe--

26:01.877 --> 26:03.879
No. I mean, I know-- I know
that you have this theory

26:03.991 --> 26:06.075
that everyone dies on you.

26:06.827 --> 26:07.644
It's not a theory.

26:07.754 --> 26:09.492
Well, it's not reality either.

26:12.809 --> 26:15.362
Okay. Is this really the
time to talk about this?

26:15.472 --> 26:17.994
I don't know. Is this the time?
You tell me.

26:18.094 --> 26:21.514
When is there ever a good time
for us to talk about anything?

26:30.010 --> 26:32.254
Why didn't you call me?

26:33.246 --> 26:35.040
8 years, why didn't you call?

26:35.140 --> 26:36.592
I told you.
I'm your past.

26:36.691 --> 26:37.415
You need to move forward.

26:37.504 --> 26:38.693
What if you are
my forward, Ryan?

26:38.772 --> 26:39.926
I mean, look at us.

26:40.036 --> 26:41.310
We're so screwed up,
we're damaged.

26:41.417 --> 26:43.503
Who else is out there
for either one of us?

26:43.600 --> 26:46.547
It's just that I know what
I'll always represent to you.

26:51.658 --> 26:54.138
Well, then what if
I told you I love you?

27:03.964 --> 27:06.415
I'd say that's
a really bad idea.

27:12.377 --> 27:14.340
And...

27:17.051 --> 27:19.113
and that I love you, too.

27:57.023 --> 27:59.256
There's a-- there's a house
through these trees.

27:59.405 --> 28:01.485
Claire's in the back
west corner.

28:01.617 --> 28:02.817
Eh, we got to move fast.

28:02.926 --> 28:04.579
Brock, you're up.

28:04.683 --> 28:06.552
Scout the place.
Put that on.

28:51.984 --> 28:53.667
One down.

29:01.852 --> 29:03.576
I told you it would work.

29:04.292 --> 29:06.986
Point-blank range
right through the vest.

29:07.779 --> 29:10.598
- Guard the back. I'll check on Claire.
- All right.

29:53.189 --> 29:54.655
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

29:54.755 --> 29:56.423
I heard a gunshot.
What happened?

29:56.523 --> 29:57.948
There's two more
of them outside.

30:00.251 --> 30:01.450
Wait here.

30:03.731 --> 30:06.318
I know you're in there, Claire.

30:07.917 --> 30:09.431
Come out.

30:10.519 --> 30:12.747
No one else has to die.

30:13.754 --> 30:15.458
No more bloodshed.

30:17.932 --> 30:20.299
I'll take you to Joey.

30:20.892 --> 30:23.816
You just come out.

30:26.940 --> 30:28.748
Aah!

30:32.613 --> 30:35.342
Ryan! You okay?

30:35.430 --> 30:36.765
Ryan!

30:38.726 --> 30:40.674
Tyson!
Come on.

30:47.069 --> 30:49.027
Hey, Ty. Tyson.

30:49.482 --> 30:50.818
Did you get him?

30:51.896 --> 30:53.218
No.

30:55.526 --> 30:56.893
He got me.

30:56.985 --> 30:58.125
Come here.

30:59.803 --> 31:01.235
Get him inside.

31:01.809 --> 31:03.795
All right. Come on.

31:04.129 --> 31:05.274
Over here.

31:05.490 --> 31:06.719
Let's get him over here.

31:06.819 --> 31:07.800
All right. Put him down.
Put him down.

31:07.888 --> 31:09.004
Easy, easy, buddy.
Easy.

31:09.092 --> 31:10.358
Set him down.

31:11.389 --> 31:12.705
Okay. There's
two wounds.

31:20.453 --> 31:22.623
Shh! No. Don't talk.
Don't talk.

31:22.739 --> 31:23.800
We have to get him
to a hospital.

31:23.896 --> 31:25.198
Hang on, buddy.
Come on, Tyson.

31:25.275 --> 31:26.535
Stay with me, baby.
Come on.

31:26.610 --> 31:27.482
Just stay awake.

31:27.570 --> 31:28.572
I'm okay, I'm okay.

31:28.649 --> 31:30.557
- That's it, that's it.
- I'm okay.

31:33.246 --> 31:35.400
- What was that?
- I don't know.

31:38.696 --> 31:39.774
Wait here,

31:40.077 --> 31:41.443
I'll be right back.

31:41.553 --> 31:43.025
Ryan, don't go down there.

31:43.126 --> 31:45.869
Hey. You heard him.

31:49.161 --> 31:52.675
It's okay. It's okay.

31:53.449 --> 31:54.925
I'll be right back.

32:23.972 --> 32:26.038
You don't want to
do that, Claire.

32:30.340 --> 32:31.502
Claire?

32:31.602 --> 32:33.393
The killing has to stop.

32:33.812 --> 32:35.758
Don't you want to see Joey?

32:40.829 --> 32:42.986
Take me to my son.

32:45.773 --> 32:47.087
Claire!

32:55.811 --> 32:56.972
Claire!

32:57.868 --> 32:59.327
Claire!

32:59.841 --> 33:01.127
Wait!

33:02.887 --> 33:04.313
I love you.

33:21.853 --> 33:23.285
Unh!

33:41.800 --> 33:43.529
Yeah. Come in.

33:47.139 --> 33:48.628
Hey.

33:57.287 --> 33:59.375
I just wanted to check on you.

33:59.722 --> 34:01.261
How you doing?

34:05.244 --> 34:06.870
Are you okay?

34:13.815 --> 34:16.340
I know it's gonna
take time, but...

34:17.925 --> 34:20.327
I want to win back your trust.

34:23.728 --> 34:25.842
I love you, Jacob.

35:10.445 --> 35:11.606
You were right.
It was a password.

35:11.745 --> 35:13.344
This is from Charlie's
encrypted URLs.

35:13.462 --> 35:15.284
Watch what happens
when I enter the sequence.

35:15.716 --> 35:18.064
And the raven,
never flitting...

35:19.294 --> 35:22.056
Still is sitting,
still is sitting

35:22.793 --> 35:24.330
on the pallid bust of pallas

35:24.423 --> 35:26.454
just above my chamber door...

35:26.547 --> 35:28.898
And his eyes have
all the seeming...

35:28.979 --> 35:30.071
Creepy as hell.

35:30.158 --> 35:31.967
Looks like one of Joe
Carroll's fan sites.

35:32.060 --> 35:33.427
No. There's something here.

35:33.507 --> 35:34.728
Can I?

35:35.015 --> 35:38.010
Shadow on the floor;
and my soul...

35:38.110 --> 35:39.248
Is that a glitch?

35:39.379 --> 35:42.414
No. See how
the pointer vanishes

35:42.516 --> 35:44.138
when I scroll over it?

35:44.822 --> 35:46.816
Nevermore!

35:46.985 --> 35:47.766
What the hell?

35:47.854 --> 35:49.068
Wow. There's
a secret door.

35:49.142 --> 35:50.292
It's called steganography,

35:50.382 --> 35:52.396
innocuous web sites
with hidden portals.

36:04.800 --> 36:05.863
Is this live?

36:05.966 --> 36:07.394
No. It's recorded.

36:07.486 --> 36:10.471
Hello, friend.
You've been allowed entry.

36:10.572 --> 36:12.915
Be prepared to change
your life forever.

36:13.011 --> 36:14.732
Enter your name
and your e-mail,

36:14.835 --> 36:16.841
and someone
will get back to you.

36:46.529 --> 36:48.878
Oh! Get away.

36:49.526 --> 36:50.625
What?

36:51.552 --> 36:52.895
I'll be right back.

37:04.246 --> 37:06.120
Why are you doing this?

37:06.213 --> 37:07.900
You know why.

37:08.401 --> 37:10.339
I'm not gonna kill her.

37:11.047 --> 37:13.298
I'm dead because of her.

37:13.443 --> 37:15.228
She betrayed us.

37:15.612 --> 37:17.397
She deserves to die.

37:19.729 --> 37:21.353
No.

37:23.632 --> 37:26.200
You're the one that's dead.

37:31.519 --> 37:35.323
Jacob, Jacob, Jacob.
Jacob, kill her.

37:35.421 --> 37:36.796
Kill her.
You know you want to.

37:36.899 --> 37:37.910
You want to.
Just kill her.

37:38.003 --> 37:39.373
I'm not gonna do it.

37:39.441 --> 37:39.993
Kill her.

37:40.088 --> 37:42.447
I'm not gonna do it.
Just leave me alone!

37:47.528 --> 37:49.953
She lied to you.
She lied to you.

37:50.043 --> 37:50.845
She lied to you.

37:50.933 --> 37:52.268
Just kill her.
Just kill her!

37:52.354 --> 37:54.872
Stop it. Stop it.
Stop it.

38:06.831 --> 38:09.101
I'm so sorry, Paul.

38:29.501 --> 38:31.268
What is it?

38:31.830 --> 38:34.464
I never told you how Paul died.

38:36.831 --> 38:38.697
I took a pillow,

38:39.915 --> 38:42.350
and I suffocated him.

38:45.224 --> 38:47.644
I killed Paul.

38:49.072 --> 38:52.529
Oh, Jacob.

38:59.285 --> 39:00.914
Yeah.

39:02.934 --> 39:04.933
I've killed now.

39:08.725 --> 39:13.466
I killed my best friend

39:13.726 --> 39:16.223
because of you.

39:20.965 --> 39:23.435
I have a real taste for it now.

39:23.758 --> 39:25.754
Shh.

39:28.519 --> 39:31.738
I'd watch my back
if I were you.

39:45.277 --> 39:47.096
I'm gonna hang around for a
while in case he wakes up

39:47.202 --> 39:48.285
if that's okay.

39:48.590 --> 39:50.013
Thanks.

39:53.336 --> 39:54.958
Yeah.

39:55.298 --> 39:57.910
Hello, Ryan.
How are you?

39:58.050 --> 40:02.332
More importantly, um,
how is your friend?

40:02.439 --> 40:03.798
Is he okay?

40:03.891 --> 40:05.980
I do hope you didn't
get him killed.

40:06.156 --> 40:08.204
I'd hate for you
to have to add him

40:08.312 --> 40:12.758
to that long list
of dead loved ones.

40:14.386 --> 40:15.993
If you hurt Claire...

40:16.097 --> 40:17.649
Hurt Claire?

40:17.755 --> 40:19.731
Heh heh heh.

40:19.872 --> 40:22.524
Have you been listening
at all, Ryan?

40:22.771 --> 40:24.970
I love Claire.

40:25.076 --> 40:26.204
She's on her way to me now.

40:26.294 --> 40:29.313
By all accounts, she
came quite willingly.

40:39.464 --> 40:41.146
I'm done, Joe.

40:41.243 --> 40:42.162
I quit.

40:42.270 --> 40:43.139
Oh, come, come.

40:43.226 --> 40:44.367
That's no way
to talk to the man

40:44.469 --> 40:47.138
who saved your life.

40:47.738 --> 40:50.841
I've allowed you
a second chance.

40:51.444 --> 40:56.384
Don't you understand
anything yet, Ryan?

40:57.076 --> 40:58.715
No. This is
your story,

40:58.838 --> 41:02.123
your-- your rebirth.

41:02.226 --> 41:03.764
Don't you feel it?

41:04.083 --> 41:08.912
With every death, you come
just that little bit more

41:09.030 --> 41:10.750
back to life.

41:10.858 --> 41:14.660
So, no, no, you can't quit now.

41:15.467 --> 41:18.474
No. You're--
you're not quite yet

41:18.585 --> 41:20.624
the man you need to be.

41:24.819 --> 41:26.529
You go to hell.

41:42.380 --> 41:44.161
Don't push her away.

41:44.272 --> 41:46.439
You got to stop
with this death curse.

41:50.709 --> 41:53.001
It's crazy to think that way.

41:53.129 --> 41:55.443
You can let people
get close to you.

41:55.801 --> 41:57.256
I mean, look at us.

41:57.605 --> 41:58.908
I'm practically your wife.

41:59.016 --> 42:00.422
You haven't gotten me killed.

42:00.500 --> 42:01.631
We've been together
over 20 years,

42:01.714 --> 42:03.294
I'm still standing.

42:05.239 --> 42:07.562
Nobody wants to die alone.

42:09.022 --> 42:10.487
We all die alone.

42:10.580 --> 42:12.882
All the more reason not
to live that way.

42:13.789 --> 42:14.903
Well, hey.
I got you.

42:15.017 --> 42:16.637
Yes, you do.

42:18.283 --> 42:19.655
All right, love birds.

42:19.768 --> 42:20.923
Food's ready.

42:45.897 --> 42:47.848
- Joe?
- Hmm?

42:54.219 --> 42:55.778
Molly.

42:55.891 --> 42:58.284
Ha ha ha! Joe!

42:58.401 --> 43:00.056
It's so good to see you.

43:00.144 --> 43:01.410
Ha ha ha!

43:02.234 --> 43:04.243
Oh. Ha ha ha!
