WEBVTT

00:03.871 --> 00:06.740
[theme music playing]

00:08.842 --> 00:11.245
That was the most
horrible, disgusting

00:11.279 --> 00:13.847
meal I've ever had in my life.

00:13.881 --> 00:15.516
You should have been
here on sushi night.

00:20.454 --> 00:22.690
Oh, great, he
pays me with a check

00:22.723 --> 00:25.259
and then stiffs me on a tip.

00:25.293 --> 00:27.628
It's not enough that I have
to work here all morning.

00:27.661 --> 00:30.431
Now, I have to follow him home
and drive all over his lawn.

00:34.402 --> 00:38.539
We'd fire her but she's got
the best attitude on the staff.

00:38.572 --> 00:39.740
Listen, I don't blame her.

00:39.773 --> 00:41.775
I put myself through
college waiting tables.

00:41.809 --> 00:44.112
I know how it can
grind you down.

00:44.145 --> 00:47.581
Yeah, but the end of the
day, that's $6 in loose change

00:47.615 --> 00:51.018
just makes it all worthwhile.

00:51.051 --> 00:54.955
Uh-- mind if I have a
look at that guy's check.

00:54.988 --> 00:58.492
You really shouldn't have to put
up with that kind of behavior.

00:58.526 --> 01:01.395
You know, when I was
waiting tables in college,

01:01.429 --> 01:03.897
I could tell you stories
that would curl--

01:03.931 --> 01:05.766
hello, Mrs. Sloan.

01:05.799 --> 01:07.135
Hi, this is Scott.

01:07.168 --> 01:12.072
I'm the desk clerk at the Come
and Go Motel over in Elgin,

01:12.106 --> 01:13.907
when you and your
husband were in here

01:13.941 --> 01:15.776
last time,
unfortunately you left

01:15.809 --> 01:19.180
some of your private
garments behind--

01:19.213 --> 01:20.581
you weren't?

01:20.614 --> 01:23.951
Well, aren't you a busty,
20-year-old blonde?

01:23.984 --> 01:25.052
Whoops, my mistake.

01:32.760 --> 01:37.431
Wow, he stiffs me for a tip
and you destroy his marriage.

01:37.465 --> 01:38.499
That's awesome.

01:38.532 --> 01:40.868
Hey, I've got more checks.
Let's do more.

01:43.604 --> 01:44.805
I thought you'd enjoy that.

01:44.838 --> 01:47.141
You look like you've ruined
a few lives in your day.

01:47.175 --> 01:50.944
I think I should tell you
that I'm a married woman.

01:50.978 --> 01:55.115
However, I'm not a
fanatic about it.

01:55.149 --> 01:58.186
Well, I'm taking
myself, almost.

01:58.219 --> 01:59.487
The wedding is Saturday.

01:59.520 --> 02:02.055
Speaking of which, I
have to order a tux

02:02.089 --> 02:03.824
and buy some flowers.

02:03.857 --> 02:06.427
Now, what's the quickest way
to get over to Frank's Florist

02:06.460 --> 02:07.561
from here.

02:07.595 --> 02:10.298
Oh, I wouldn't go to
Frank's if I were you.

02:10.331 --> 02:11.465
You know, that
guy that was here?

02:11.499 --> 02:12.366
Yeah.

02:12.400 --> 02:15.035
That was Frank.

02:15.068 --> 02:18.706
Oh, OK, so where do we go to
get a good price on flowers?

02:18.739 --> 02:23.577
Well, the dumpster behind
Spiegelman's Funeral Home.

02:23.611 --> 02:25.813
And I don't think you'd
find anything good to wear

02:25.846 --> 02:27.815
with that tuxedo
shop on Main Street

02:27.848 --> 02:32.653
either, unless you're
one of the Commodores.

02:32.686 --> 02:35.055
Man, you are good.

02:35.088 --> 02:36.690
So are you nervous?

02:36.724 --> 02:39.593
Well, yeah, I guess, sort of.

02:39.627 --> 02:42.263
We were supposed to get
married five years ago,

02:42.296 --> 02:44.565
but I get left at the altar.

02:44.598 --> 02:46.734
I just don't want to
have it happen again.

02:46.767 --> 02:48.769
What kind of a horrible
bitch would dump you?

02:52.906 --> 02:53.774
Scott.

02:53.807 --> 02:57.245
Hi, honey.

02:57.278 --> 03:00.648
[theme music playing]

03:47.861 --> 03:51.098
Why didn't you tell me
you were getting married?

03:51.131 --> 03:54.234
Because you are you.

03:54.268 --> 03:56.304
Yeah, but you
didn't tell anybody.

03:56.337 --> 03:59.172
Because Because, Roseanne, it
would have gotten back to you.

03:59.206 --> 04:02.376
And again, you are you.

04:02.410 --> 04:04.978
So this is Roseanne.

04:05.012 --> 04:06.347
Prove it.

04:06.380 --> 04:09.149
Do that thing where you spew
bile and scare young children.

04:12.786 --> 04:17.591
Oh, I only do that
at the Christmas party.

04:17.625 --> 04:20.193
So what in the hell
is wrong with you

04:20.227 --> 04:23.364
to leave a terrific guy
like this at the altar.

04:23.397 --> 04:26.300
You know, Roseanne, I don't
think this really concerns you.

04:26.334 --> 04:29.002
I mean, why don't
you just waddle away?

04:29.036 --> 04:32.139
Oh, look, crumbs.

04:32.172 --> 04:34.174
You know, you can
do so much better.

04:34.207 --> 04:36.577
I mean it.

04:36.610 --> 04:39.279
Even in a small
town like this one,

04:39.313 --> 04:42.049
he is at the very bottom
of the homosexual heap.

04:46.186 --> 04:48.956
Well, that sounds like fun.

04:48.989 --> 04:52.059
So, Scott,
everything worked out

04:52.092 --> 04:53.160
all right up in Minneapolis?

04:53.193 --> 04:54.428
It went fine.

04:54.462 --> 04:56.296
My family minister is
perfectly willing to marry us,

04:56.330 --> 04:59.099
but we do have to fly to
Minnesota for a few days

04:59.132 --> 05:01.702
of premarital counseling.

05:01.735 --> 05:03.203
No, no, I can't
fly to Minneapolis.

05:03.236 --> 05:04.271
What?

05:04.304 --> 05:05.873
I have to meet with
the wedding planner.

05:05.906 --> 05:08.909
There's still tons
of stuff to do.

05:08.942 --> 05:09.843
Wait a minute.

05:09.877 --> 05:11.278
Maybe Roseanne
can work with him.

05:11.311 --> 05:12.780
She seems to know
everything there is to know

05:12.813 --> 05:14.014
about planning a wedding.

05:14.047 --> 05:15.949
No, no, no, no, no.

05:15.983 --> 05:18.452
Roseanne is not to be
trusted with anything

05:18.486 --> 05:21.221
that involves cake.

05:21.254 --> 05:23.724
Come on, Leon,
I'll do it for free.

05:23.757 --> 05:26.827
And I have not said those words
since my own wedding night.

05:30.063 --> 05:32.833
Did you hear that?
Roseanne will plan it for free.

05:32.866 --> 05:35.636
Of course, we'll have
Roseanne plan our wedding.

05:35.669 --> 05:37.738
You know, I've always
dreamed of a ceremony that

05:37.771 --> 05:41.875
would culminate in a hog fry.

05:41.909 --> 05:42.910
Hog fry?

05:42.943 --> 05:43.811
What?

05:43.844 --> 05:47.114
Is the Governor coming?

05:47.147 --> 05:50.250
But just think with the money
we save on the wedding planner,

05:50.283 --> 05:52.285
we could afford that
honeymoon trip in the Bahamas

05:52.319 --> 05:53.587
we've always wanted.

05:53.621 --> 05:57.290
Scott, I was thinking we
would go into Greece myself.

05:57.324 --> 06:00.327
You can grease
yourself in the Bahamas.

06:00.360 --> 06:03.764
Just think, this time
next week, we could

06:03.797 --> 06:05.566
be snorkeling in the nude.

06:05.599 --> 06:06.967
Snorkeling, huh?

06:07.000 --> 06:09.870
Well, I guess you learn a
new word for it every day.

06:09.903 --> 06:10.838
Oh, Roseanne.

06:10.871 --> 06:11.705
She's terrible.

06:14.675 --> 06:18.111
Come on, after what you did
to me last time, you owe me.

06:18.145 --> 06:21.415
All right, I will
do it for you, Scott.

06:21.449 --> 06:24.652
I will itemize exactly
everything we need

06:24.685 --> 06:26.219
and where to get it.

06:26.253 --> 06:27.555
Don't you worry
about it, Leon.

06:27.588 --> 06:29.156
I'm going to do a
great job for you guys,

06:29.189 --> 06:30.290
because you know what?

06:30.323 --> 06:32.392
I've always thought of
you as the middle aged,

06:32.426 --> 06:34.762
obnoxious gay son
that I've never had.

06:37.698 --> 06:39.867
So have you ever been
fitted for chaps?

06:39.900 --> 06:42.636
[music playing]

06:46.039 --> 06:47.975
David, Roseanne's
at the reception hall.

06:48.008 --> 06:50.544
She wants to know how the
seating chart's going.

06:50.578 --> 06:51.812
Hey, Mrs. Conner.

06:51.845 --> 06:55.248
Yes, it looks like each
table's going to be boy, girl,

06:55.282 --> 07:01.254
boy, boy, boy, boy, and boy.

07:01.288 --> 07:03.691
OK, and I'm checking
on the male strippers.

07:06.760 --> 07:09.463
I can't stop looking
at these guys.

07:09.497 --> 07:11.732
They're so clean and shiny.

07:14.568 --> 07:16.169
So, who's it going to be?

07:16.203 --> 07:19.707
Rod, Lance or Shaft?

07:19.740 --> 07:21.975
Dan, you got a second?

07:22.009 --> 07:24.545
I need you to check
on a stripper for me.

07:33.654 --> 07:34.955
Those aren't strippers.

07:34.988 --> 07:36.624
Those are guys.

07:36.657 --> 07:39.059
What are you guy looking at?

07:39.092 --> 07:41.995
Radial tires.

07:42.029 --> 07:43.997
Oh, wow, cool!

07:46.667 --> 07:47.467
Cool?

07:50.403 --> 07:52.940
Why would you look at those
pictures and say cool?

07:52.973 --> 07:55.308
Because this one's
my math teacher.

08:06.654 --> 08:09.089
Cool.

08:09.122 --> 08:11.291
What's with the
strippers anyway?

08:11.324 --> 08:13.226
Is she throwing Leon
bachelor party, too?

08:13.260 --> 08:14.595
No, they're for the reception.

08:14.628 --> 08:18.398
She's going to put them in cages
on either side of the cake.

08:18.431 --> 08:21.869
But I thought Lean wanted
something modest and tasteful.

08:21.902 --> 08:23.003
That's why they're in cages.

08:25.773 --> 08:28.942
Well, she's gone
way overboard.

08:28.976 --> 08:32.179
Somebody is going to have to sit
her down and set her straight.

08:37.450 --> 08:39.653
I didn't mean me.

08:39.687 --> 08:42.455
[music playing]

08:47.828 --> 08:48.996
Where in the
hell have you been?

08:49.029 --> 08:50.664
The wedding is in an hour.

08:50.698 --> 08:51.565
The flight was delayed.

08:51.599 --> 08:52.465
I'm sorry.

08:52.499 --> 08:53.934
I got here as soon as--

08:53.967 --> 08:55.002
whoa.

08:55.035 --> 08:55.903
What's the matter?

08:55.936 --> 08:57.170
No, nothing.

08:57.204 --> 08:59.206
It's just the sight of you
in tasteful surroundings,

08:59.239 --> 09:03.276
Roseanne, kind of startling.

09:03.310 --> 09:04.411
This is nothing.

09:04.444 --> 09:06.079
They wouldn't even let
me decorate out here.

09:06.113 --> 09:10.651
Wait till you see the man hall.

09:10.684 --> 09:11.752
[loud music]

09:11.785 --> 09:14.855
(SINGING) They were
never going to go away.

09:14.888 --> 09:19.292
Can't you see
we're here to stay.

09:19.326 --> 09:25.699
They were never going
to go away again.

09:25.733 --> 09:27.434
I cannot believe this.

09:30.370 --> 09:32.305
Or this.

09:32.339 --> 09:33.473
Or this.

09:33.506 --> 09:36.376
What it-- this is-- this is--

09:36.409 --> 09:37.645
what is this?

09:37.678 --> 09:41.114
Well, they didn't have
anything with two grooms, see.

09:41.148 --> 09:43.083
So we broke off
the bride and then

09:43.116 --> 09:46.754
we replaced it with one of the
action heroes from Pocahontas.

09:51.591 --> 09:53.526
Roseanne, what is all this?

09:53.560 --> 09:55.963
It's a gay wedding.

09:55.996 --> 09:57.064
This isn't a wedding.

09:57.097 --> 09:59.566
It's a circus.

09:59.599 --> 10:02.903
You have somehow managed to
take every gay stereotype

10:02.936 --> 10:06.173
and just roll them
up into one gigantic,

10:06.206 --> 10:13.080
offensive Roseannical
ball of wrong.

10:13.113 --> 10:14.147
Relax.

10:14.181 --> 10:17.951
Nobody gets the wedding
they really want.

10:17.985 --> 10:21.021
Now, look, I need a picture
of you for the newspaper.

10:21.054 --> 10:22.422
And not that
retouched one, where

10:22.455 --> 10:24.925
you look like Joan van Ark.

10:24.958 --> 10:27.327
It's off.

10:27.360 --> 10:29.129
What do you mean?

10:29.162 --> 10:31.264
I said the wedding is off.

10:31.298 --> 10:33.934
Well, of course,
it's a little off.

10:33.967 --> 10:38.038
It's two guys for god's sake.

10:38.071 --> 10:40.874
[music playing]

10:46.279 --> 10:49.382
Oh, uh-- did anybody here
lose their hearing aid?

10:54.955 --> 10:56.857
Here, this is yours.

11:02.462 --> 11:05.032
Looks like everything
is going well.

11:05.065 --> 11:05.933
Where's Leon?

11:05.966 --> 11:07.935
Locked in the bathroom.

11:07.968 --> 11:09.837
He locked himself
in the bathroom?

11:09.870 --> 11:10.738
What is he like crying?

11:10.771 --> 11:12.239
Well, he might be by now.

11:12.272 --> 11:14.341
I locked him in there.

11:14.374 --> 11:15.675
What?

11:15.709 --> 11:17.044
He was going to leave.

11:17.077 --> 11:19.579
Apparently, he thinks that I
went too far with this wedding.

11:19.612 --> 11:20.748
Isn't that ridiculous?

11:24.217 --> 11:25.385
Oh, hi, Roseanne.

11:25.418 --> 11:27.154
Here's the happy groom.

11:27.187 --> 11:28.355
Please, not too loud.

11:28.388 --> 11:32.525
My buddies took me out and
got me drunk last night.

11:32.559 --> 11:36.296
I remember when I needed
buddies to get drunk.

11:36.329 --> 11:39.366
Roseanne, I want
you to say hello

11:39.399 --> 11:41.301
to two very special people.

11:41.334 --> 11:43.136
This is Leon's mother.

11:43.170 --> 11:46.073
This is Reverend Crossley.

11:46.106 --> 11:47.407
And my name is Scott.

11:47.440 --> 11:48.675
And I may be an alcoholic.

11:48.708 --> 11:50.610
And I'm going to greet
people since my hand is

11:50.643 --> 11:52.379
shaking anyway.

11:52.412 --> 11:57.484
Oh, Roseanne, Leon's told
me a great deal about you.

11:57.517 --> 12:02.790
But the Polaroid's
didn't quite prepare me.

12:02.823 --> 12:06.126
How wonderful it is that you
were able to get that house off

12:06.159 --> 12:07.294
of you in time for the wedding.

12:12.565 --> 12:14.868
And you must be the reverend.

12:14.902 --> 12:16.569
I hear you are just terrific.

12:16.603 --> 12:18.105
Well, thank you.

12:18.138 --> 12:23.343
People do find my ceremony to
be quite inimical, though it's

12:23.376 --> 12:27.314
taken me years of
premeditated consecration

12:27.347 --> 12:29.649
to bring it to its
ultimate contraception.

12:33.020 --> 12:34.822
Look at this place.

12:34.855 --> 12:37.124
Have you ever seen
such a horrific display

12:37.157 --> 12:40.227
of blue collar tastelessness?

12:40.260 --> 12:42.395
You got a big busted
vein right in your nose.

12:45.532 --> 12:48.768
Reverend, would you
care to see me to my seat?

12:48.802 --> 12:52.239
It would be an
extinct pleasure, madam.

12:52.272 --> 12:54.774
Hey, now that the
other groom's here,

12:54.808 --> 12:56.844
don't you think you ought to
let Leon out of the bathroom?

12:56.877 --> 12:59.546
Well, actually, I was
hoping you would do it,

12:59.579 --> 13:01.982
because as soon as you open
that door, he's going to bolt.

13:02.015 --> 13:03.851
So you are going to
have to tackle him

13:03.884 --> 13:06.653
and then drag him down the aisle
here and try to make it look

13:06.686 --> 13:09.622
like you're giving him away.

13:09.656 --> 13:12.292
I think you ought to tone the
wedding down like he wanted.

13:12.325 --> 13:13.526
No.

13:13.560 --> 13:17.164
This is my wedding and he's
lucky I cast him in it.

13:17.197 --> 13:18.999
Roseanne, I know you
wanted this wedding

13:19.032 --> 13:20.133
to be a certain way.

13:20.167 --> 13:21.301
But if you don't
do something there

13:21.334 --> 13:22.369
isn't going to be a wedding.

13:22.402 --> 13:23.503
It's going to be all
your fault. And you

13:23.536 --> 13:25.138
know who is going to suffer?

13:25.172 --> 13:27.274
Me.

13:27.307 --> 13:28.175
Fine.

13:28.208 --> 13:29.676
Nancy, come here.

13:29.709 --> 13:31.344
Now you guys have
to stall the guests

13:31.378 --> 13:33.746
and keep them entertained
so I can go to the bathroom

13:33.780 --> 13:35.148
to talk to Leon.

13:35.182 --> 13:37.617
Now, if you hear any
screaming, just tell everybody

13:37.650 --> 13:40.220
that Yoko Ono is warming up.

13:40.253 --> 13:43.056
[music playing]

13:47.995 --> 13:49.029
Hey!

13:49.062 --> 13:49.930
You!

13:49.963 --> 13:51.764
With the pink limo.

13:51.798 --> 13:55.135
Hey, I'll give you $50 to back
that thing through this wall.

13:58.405 --> 13:59.539
All right, you win.

13:59.572 --> 14:01.308
I will totally
change the wedding.

14:01.341 --> 14:04.544
OK, you can have your nice,
quiet, boring ceremony.

14:04.577 --> 14:05.678
And I don't care.

14:05.712 --> 14:07.047
While people are
yawning, I'll just

14:07.080 --> 14:10.350
throw peanuts in their mouth.

14:10.383 --> 14:12.819
I'm not getting
married, Roseanne.

14:12.852 --> 14:14.654
Did you hear me?
Wake up.

14:14.687 --> 14:21.394
I said, no Lizas, no Judys,
no Antonio Banderas matchbook.

14:21.428 --> 14:24.364
This is not about
the decorations.

14:24.397 --> 14:27.600
I mean as hideous
as they may be,

14:27.634 --> 14:31.238
that's not the reason that I've
been throwing up every morning

14:31.271 --> 14:32.572
for the past week.

14:32.605 --> 14:33.540
Oh, my god, you're pregnant.

14:36.944 --> 14:39.079
It's not funny, Roseanne.

14:42.015 --> 14:44.084
I'm just not ready
to get married.

14:44.117 --> 14:46.086
Oh, come on, you're
just getting cold feet.

14:46.119 --> 14:47.554
Is that what happened
to you before?

14:47.587 --> 14:49.689
No, no, no, last
time was different.

14:49.722 --> 14:52.225
I was young, and I was immature.

14:52.259 --> 14:53.060
You were 47.

14:55.828 --> 14:56.829
Whatever.

14:56.863 --> 14:57.730
I don't know.

14:57.764 --> 14:58.999
Well, if you'll excuse me.

14:59.032 --> 15:03.070
No way, you're not going
to do this to Scott again.

15:03.103 --> 15:04.437
You're right.

15:04.471 --> 15:06.006
What was I thinking?

15:06.039 --> 15:10.243
I mean, Scott deserves
better treatment than--

15:10.277 --> 15:11.511
First time, I stop you.

15:11.544 --> 15:14.747
Second time, I kill you.

15:14.781 --> 15:16.516
What is the matter
with you, Leon.

15:16.549 --> 15:19.252
I mean, jeez, next to
you hair plugs, Scott

15:19.286 --> 15:21.188
is the best thing that's
ever happened to you.

15:21.221 --> 15:26.026
Right, but unlike hair
plugs, marriage is permanent.

15:26.059 --> 15:27.260
No it isn't.

15:27.294 --> 15:29.596
I wake up every single
morning knowing I

15:29.629 --> 15:31.298
could leave Dan if I wanted to.

15:31.331 --> 15:33.866
I'm just too damn lazy.

15:33.900 --> 15:36.669
Well, then what if he
doesn't like my cooking?

15:36.703 --> 15:37.770
Then eat out.

15:37.804 --> 15:39.606
What if I can't
stand his mother, huh?

15:39.639 --> 15:40.907
Then stay in.

15:40.940 --> 15:43.743
OK, Scott says he is
not himself in the morning

15:43.776 --> 15:45.012
until he has a Pop Tart.

15:45.045 --> 15:46.879
Well what if they
stop making Pop Tarts?

15:46.913 --> 15:49.216
Leon-- Leon, listen to me--

15:49.249 --> 15:51.518
I will be living with someone
who will never be himself.

15:51.551 --> 15:54.354
They will never
stop making Pop Tarts!

16:02.229 --> 16:06.266
OK, then how about this?

16:06.299 --> 16:08.135
Ready?

16:08.168 --> 16:10.937
What if I am not
even really gay?

16:15.075 --> 16:17.677
You couldn't be any gayer
if your name was Gay Gayerson.

16:20.680 --> 16:22.115
Oh, yeah?

16:22.149 --> 16:25.318
Well, you just think
about it, young lady.

16:25.352 --> 16:27.687
I hate to shops.

16:27.720 --> 16:30.190
I am absolutely insensitive.

16:30.223 --> 16:31.558
I detest Barbara Streisand.

16:31.591 --> 16:33.326
And for God's sake,
I'm a Republican.

16:36.463 --> 16:38.231
But do you like
having sex with men?

16:38.265 --> 16:39.132
Well, it's--

16:39.166 --> 16:39.966
Gay!

16:47.307 --> 16:48.208
Oh, yeah?

16:55.715 --> 16:56.583
I'm gay.

16:56.616 --> 16:58.385
Let's do.

16:58.418 --> 17:00.720
[music playing]

17:25.778 --> 17:27.947
Are you OK?

17:27.980 --> 17:30.250
I guess so.

17:30.283 --> 17:33.420
I mean, if he's
happy, then I'm happy.

17:33.453 --> 17:40.327
It's just that years ago when
I pictured my son's wedding,

17:40.360 --> 17:44.030
I certainly didn't
have this in mind.

17:44.063 --> 17:47.300
Yeah, this probably is
weird for you being the mom.

17:47.334 --> 17:49.636
But you know, I'm sure when
you pictured his wedding,

17:49.669 --> 17:53.173
you also pictured him marrying
somebody that really loved him.

17:53.206 --> 17:55.175
And that is what's
happening here, you know.

17:55.208 --> 17:57.043
Love is love.

17:57.076 --> 17:58.845
I suppose.

17:58.878 --> 18:02.682
And besides you're getting a
nice addition to your family.

18:02.715 --> 18:05.385
That's my son-in-law over there.

18:05.418 --> 18:06.219
Ouch.

18:10.757 --> 18:12.192
Ouch.

18:12.225 --> 18:15.162
Ouch.

18:15.195 --> 18:17.997
Oh, oh, I'm so sorry.

18:21.301 --> 18:25.004
Nearly beloved,
we are gathered here

18:25.037 --> 18:31.077
today to join this
couple, he and he,

18:31.110 --> 18:36.783
in the bonds of holy alimony.

18:36.816 --> 18:40.353
Now I had some very importionate
remarks here somewhere.

18:42.989 --> 18:44.424
I love you, you know.

18:44.457 --> 18:45.258
I know.

18:48.127 --> 18:51.030
And you love me, right?

18:51.063 --> 18:55.502
I love you in a way that
is mystical and eternal

18:55.535 --> 18:57.103
and illegal in 20 states.

19:00.640 --> 19:02.509
That's the most beautiful
thing I've ever heard.

19:05.612 --> 19:08.448
So you really want to do this?

19:08.481 --> 19:10.149
Yeah.

19:10.183 --> 19:13.453
In sickness and in health.

19:13.486 --> 19:16.523
Till death do us both part.

19:16.556 --> 19:19.492
Sure you can handle it?

19:19.526 --> 19:20.327
Nope.

19:23.396 --> 19:26.666
It's going to be
great, you know.

19:26.699 --> 19:30.237
Yeah, I know.

19:30.270 --> 19:32.239
Boy, that all
sounded good to me.

19:35.875 --> 19:37.644
Let's move right on.

19:37.677 --> 19:44.183
Do you, Leon, take this Scott to
be your awfully rabid husband,

19:44.217 --> 19:47.887
to escalate, to cherish, to fax?

19:50.156 --> 19:50.957
I do.

19:53.893 --> 19:59.666
And I do, Scott, erratically
agree to all the same stuff?

19:59.699 --> 20:01.334
I do.

20:01.368 --> 20:05.305
Then by the power
encrusted in me,

20:05.338 --> 20:09.776
I now pronounce you man and--

20:09.809 --> 20:12.412
I now pronounce you men.

20:12.445 --> 20:15.114
Amen.

20:15.147 --> 20:19.519
You may kiss the bride
if there so be one.

20:19.552 --> 20:20.920
It doesn't matter.

20:28.461 --> 20:30.162
And there's the kiss.

20:30.196 --> 20:32.198
I wondering if they
were going to do it.

20:32.231 --> 20:34.934
And they're doing it.

20:34.967 --> 20:37.370
Yeah, look at them go at it.

20:37.404 --> 20:40.006
They are not going at it, Dan.

20:40.039 --> 20:43.042
It just happens to be two
people of the same sex kissing,

20:43.075 --> 20:46.178
and there's nothing
wrong with that.
