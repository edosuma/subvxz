WEBVTT

00:01.001 --> 00:03.538
All right, everybody.
Load and make ready.

00:03.587 --> 00:05.828
(clicking)
Chamber 3 round.

00:05.881 --> 00:10.124
This scenario is called
"Shoot, Don't Shoot."

00:10.177 --> 00:13.169
If your target looks like a bad guy, shoot it.

00:13.222 --> 00:15.008
If it does not... Peck?

00:15.057 --> 00:16.968
- Don't shoot!
- That is right.

00:17.017 --> 00:19.224
- Are we ready?
- (rookies) Yes, sir!

00:19.269 --> 00:22.807
All right, let's make some good decisions.

00:22.856 --> 00:24.187
The range is hot!

00:24.233 --> 00:27.646
(Tegan and Sara)
J‘ No, I'm not ready J‘

00:27.694 --> 00:30.106
J‘ For a big, bad step in their direction J‘

00:30.155 --> 00:33.397
J‘ No, I'm not ready J‘

00:33.450 --> 00:35.566
J‘ For downtown trash and void collection .l‘

00:35.619 --> 00:38.486
(Oliver) Prove safe! Benches down.

00:38.539 --> 00:41.326
.l‘ Cityscapes, cities change before they die .l‘

00:41.375 --> 00:42.911
.l‘ Four blocks I should mention .l‘

00:42.960 --> 00:46.202
Let's take a look here. Nice shoot--

00:46.255 --> 00:48.792
under controlled circumstances, that is.

00:48.840 --> 00:52.378
But we all know that out there in real life,

00:52.427 --> 00:53.803
things are never controlled.

00:53.845 --> 00:55.801
They are unpredictable, wild.

00:55.847 --> 00:58.429
So holster your guns.

00:58.475 --> 00:59.931
Come on. Put 'em away!

01:01.103 --> 01:03.469
- Now drop and give me 15.
- What?!

01:03.522 --> 01:05.183
You have 15 seconds. Do it!

01:05.232 --> 01:07.939
.l‘ Get off and over it and over them J‘

01:07.985 --> 01:11.068
.l‘ Uh-oh, hell, no, uh-oh, hell, no .l‘

01:12.406 --> 01:13.862
(Dov) He's just trying to mess us up!

01:13.907 --> 01:15.408
Epstein, shut it.

01:15.450 --> 01:18.032
Okay, everybody up! Load your clips.

01:18.078 --> 01:20.740
(clicking)

01:20.789 --> 01:23.201
Faster! Benches up!

01:25.919 --> 01:27.705
(shell casings clattering)

01:27.754 --> 01:32.043
J‘ No, we're not ready for fair distribution .l‘

01:32.092 --> 01:33.957
(Oliver) Prove safe!

01:35.095 --> 01:36.596
All right.

01:36.638 --> 01:39.550
Epstein, you shot a man
carrying a cell phone.

01:39.600 --> 01:41.056
Probably he's going to sue.

01:41.101 --> 01:43.513
You're gonna be working for him
for the rest of your life.

01:44.438 --> 01:47.555
Peck, Diaz, not bad.

01:47.608 --> 01:49.018
Also not good.

01:49.067 --> 01:50.853
(sighs)

01:50.902 --> 01:52.517
Toughie Nash, you didn't shoot at all.

01:52.571 --> 01:53.936
I thought it was the mother.

01:53.989 --> 01:54.978
(Oliver) Oh, is it?

01:55.032 --> 01:56.067
- (Traci) No.
- No, what is it?

01:56.116 --> 01:57.196
It's a bad guy.

01:57.242 --> 01:58.527
- What are you?
- I'm dead.

01:58.577 --> 02:02.536
Nice. McNaIly, you got your bad guy.
Congratulations.

02:02.581 --> 02:05.368
But not before you shot him up
like a piece of Swiss cheese.

02:05.417 --> 02:06.748
What does this mean, sir?

02:06.793 --> 02:08.533
I mean, do we fail our recertification?

02:08.587 --> 02:11.545
Well, what this means is,
um, you're all still rookies.

02:11.590 --> 02:13.080
- (laughs)
- .l‘ Up and over it J‘

02:13.133 --> 02:14.634
J‘ And over them .l‘

02:14.676 --> 02:17.463
J‘ I know you feel it, too .l‘

02:17.512 --> 02:19.798
.l‘ It all seems so untrue .l‘

02:19.848 --> 02:23.090
.l‘ When you get up and over it
and over them .l‘

02:23.143 --> 02:25.930
.l‘ Uh-oh, hell, no, uh-oh, hell, no .l‘

02:25.979 --> 02:28.766
.l‘ Uh-oh, hell, no, uh-oh, hell, no .l‘

02:28.815 --> 02:30.100
(sighs) | feel like my whole life

02:30.150 --> 02:32.311
- is like that shooting range.
- Collateral damage?

02:32.361 --> 02:34.773
Yeah, except half the time
I don't even know what my target is.

02:34.821 --> 02:36.436
Why can't my life be like, um...

02:36.490 --> 02:38.151
what did Oliver call it?

02:38.200 --> 02:39.440
Controlled situation.

02:39.493 --> 02:40.573
Controlled circumstance.

02:40.619 --> 02:43.031
And, Dov, your circumstances with Edie

02:43.080 --> 02:44.490
were anything but controlled last night.

02:44.539 --> 02:47.451
Oh, please, please, please--
a little roommate respect here,

02:47.501 --> 02:49.412
- thank you very much.
- Thin walls?

02:49.461 --> 02:51.122
We gotta nail up some egg cartons
or something.

02:51.171 --> 02:54.459
Aw, Dov. Dating a stripper.
You're such a cop cliché.

02:54.508 --> 02:56.624
Uh, don't you mean cop fantasy?
Because,uh,

02:56.677 --> 02:58.167
most men would kill
to be in my position.

02:58.220 --> 02:59.460
Or should I say positions?

02:59.513 --> 03:01.424
- Pfft.
- Couldn't do it, man--

03:01.473 --> 03:03.009
I mean, date a stripper.

03:03.058 --> 03:05.640
- Don't you ever feel weird?
- No.

03:05.686 --> 03:07.301
Hey, how are things going
with you and Jerry?

03:07.354 --> 03:09.970
Ah, confusing.
Baby, boyfriend, the job--

03:10.023 --> 03:11.433
might as well throw 'em all in a blender.

03:11.483 --> 03:13.644
Look, could we not talk about this?

03:13.694 --> 03:16.106
I mean, some of us are newly single.

03:16.154 --> 03:17.314
Would you grow a pair?

03:17.364 --> 03:18.604
You know what, Gail?

03:18.657 --> 03:20.773
This whole thing with your brother
isn't my fault,

03:20.826 --> 03:24.569
and we have to work together, so...

03:24.621 --> 03:26.452
so can't you be nice to me?

03:26.498 --> 03:28.864
That's the pair you grew? Wow.

03:29.876 --> 03:31.832
Whoo! Bravo.

03:31.878 --> 03:34.585
(Gail) Why am | the only one
who's ever on time for parade?

03:34.631 --> 03:37.122
Because your dad flies you in
on "Peck Force One" every morning.

03:37.175 --> 03:38.676
(laughs) Are you coming?

03:38.719 --> 03:39.959
Yeah, I'll meet you in there.

03:42.639 --> 03:44.004
Callaghan, how's it goin'?

03:44.057 --> 03:46.639
Never better. I hear you got
a big day ahead of you.

03:46.685 --> 03:48.721
I guess. Wasn't my call.

03:48.770 --> 03:50.271
Things just happen to you,
don't they, Sammy?

03:50.313 --> 03:51.439
Tell me. (clears throat)

03:51.481 --> 03:53.437
You ever take responsibility
for anything?

03:55.026 --> 03:56.732
You take care, buddy. (chuckles)

04:08.999 --> 04:09.988
You need something?

04:10.041 --> 04:12.373
No, just--

04:12.419 --> 04:14.250
I got a lotto do,
unless this is work-related.

04:15.797 --> 04:18.379
W-We haven't even talked
since you left, so I thought--

04:18.425 --> 04:20.336
I don't have time.

04:20.385 --> 04:21.420
Okay.

04:23.221 --> 04:24.836
Maybe later then.

04:24.890 --> 04:26.596
Hey.

04:26.641 --> 04:28.017
Have a good trip.

04:31.104 --> 04:34.847
(indistinct conversations)

04:34.900 --> 04:36.231
(man laughs)

04:36.276 --> 04:37.777
Hey, McNaIly--
(door closes)

04:37.819 --> 04:39.775
(Frank) Okay, listen up!

04:39.821 --> 04:42.107
I'm looking for a word--

04:42.157 --> 04:45.741
a word to describe
the rookie recertification this morning.

04:45.786 --> 04:47.242
It's a 6-letter word.

04:48.622 --> 04:51.238
Anyone, could you help me?
Anyone?

04:52.250 --> 04:53.285
Fiasco.

04:54.586 --> 04:56.451
That's the word.

04:56.505 --> 04:58.962
Fi-as-co.

04:59.007 --> 05:00.918
(marker clatters)
You get to carry a gun,

05:00.967 --> 05:03.219
but you gotta know
how to use it and prove it.

05:03.261 --> 05:05.593
It's been five months since the academy,

05:05.639 --> 05:07.630
and you neophytes still can't improvise.

05:07.682 --> 05:08.671
(whispers) Neo-what?

05:08.725 --> 05:12.764
McNaIly, you were the only rookie
to be recertified...

05:12.813 --> 05:14.098
barely,

05:14.147 --> 05:16.058
and as a reward,
I'm sending you to Sudbury.

05:16.107 --> 05:18.268
- What, sir?
- Sudbury.

05:18.318 --> 05:19.774
To transport a prisoner.

05:19.820 --> 05:20.809
By myself?

05:20.862 --> 05:22.602
No.

05:22.656 --> 05:25.489
Swarek, uh, brief your rookie.

05:25.534 --> 05:31.279
End of shift, the rest of you have a date
with the firing range. That's all.

05:31.331 --> 05:33.367
Serve, protect
and keep your eye on the target.

05:33.959 --> 05:34.948
Please!

05:35.544 --> 05:36.579
You can't do it.

05:36.628 --> 05:39.165
You can't go on a holi-date with Swarek,
not after what happened.

05:39.214 --> 05:41.956
l have to.
Traci, he's my TO, okay?

05:42.008 --> 05:44.670
Look, it's not a holi-date.
It's an assignment.

05:44.719 --> 05:46.334
Well, just get Frank to reassign you.

05:46.388 --> 05:47.503
Oh, yeah, I'm just gonna talk

05:47.556 --> 05:49.137
to my staff sergeant
about my man problems.

05:49.182 --> 05:51.047
- Mm. Yeah, okay. You're right.
- I'm just gonna ignore him.

05:51.101 --> 05:52.637
That's gonna work.
Listen, listen, listen.

05:52.686 --> 05:56.304
Why don't you just pretend
that it never happened?

05:56.356 --> 05:58.972
- Pretend to be his friend.
- Oh, friend. Yeah.

05:59.025 --> 06:02.188
(whispers) I can't be friends
with Sam Swarek right now.

06:02.237 --> 06:05.149
Um... okay. Just--
Listen, you can do this, all right?

06:05.198 --> 06:06.654
Just forget the past

06:06.700 --> 06:09.567
and act like this thing with Swarek
neverhappened.

06:09.619 --> 06:12.156
You can do it.
You can do it.

06:12.205 --> 06:14.036
Great idea, Traci. Thank you.

06:15.876 --> 06:17.036
(whispers) Yeah.

06:19.546 --> 06:20.956
Noelle, 15's finest...

06:21.006 --> 06:21.995
No.

06:22.048 --> 06:23.549
Take McNally up to Sudbury for me.

06:23.592 --> 06:24.798
Hell, no.

06:24.843 --> 06:26.834
Please. I'll do your papenNork.

06:26.887 --> 06:28.002
Please. Plea...

06:28.054 --> 06:30.340
(laughs) Oh, you are
working the dimples.

06:30.390 --> 06:32.221
Wow. You must really want this.

06:32.267 --> 06:33.507
- I do.
- (laughs)

06:33.560 --> 06:35.676
I hate prisoner transports.
Mm-mm. No.

06:35.729 --> 06:37.219
You're stuck in a car all day
with a jailbird,

06:37.272 --> 06:38.887
and then you gotta buy 'em a hot dog
just to shut 'em up.

06:38.940 --> 06:43.024
Williams, please,
just do me this solid, please.

06:43.069 --> 06:44.900
I don't know what's going on
with you and this rookie,

06:44.946 --> 06:47.904
but whatever it is, work it out.

06:49.117 --> 06:50.698
You look like hell. What's up?

06:50.744 --> 06:52.280
(lowered voice)
I can't find my notes.

06:52.329 --> 06:54.570
- What?
- The basement double murder,

06:54.623 --> 06:56.989
the witness Swarek and McNally
are picking up in Sudbury--

06:57.042 --> 06:58.373
- that case, my case.
- Uh-huh. Yeah.

06:58.418 --> 07:00.158
l have to testify first thing
in the morning.

07:00.211 --> 07:02.543
I can't find my notes.

07:02.589 --> 07:04.580
What do you mean,
that you can't find them?

07:04.633 --> 07:06.214
(normal voice)
My notebook from that day.

07:06.259 --> 07:08.250
|--| don't know.
|--| must've misplaced it.

07:08.303 --> 07:09.759
Well, sometimes you just
have to double-check--

07:09.804 --> 07:11.635
- No, no. I checked.
I've been doing nothing but checking

07:11.681 --> 07:13.717
the last 24 hours.
I turned my office upside down.

07:13.767 --> 07:15.007
Still, there's nothing. It's not--

07:15.060 --> 07:16.220
- It's not there. It's just...
- Oh, God.

07:16.269 --> 07:19.011
Oh, Jerry, losing your notes
is almost as bad as losing your gun.

07:19.064 --> 07:21.225
Yeah, I know, Traci.

07:21.274 --> 07:23.014
It was during the time
of my divorce, and |--

07:23.068 --> 07:24.683
Okay, what about
the prosecutor's office?

07:24.736 --> 07:26.818
I mean, don't they keep a dummy sheet,
a copy of the notes?

07:26.863 --> 07:28.023
Oh, yeah, that's a good idea.

07:28.073 --> 07:29.313
I'm gonna call the prosecutor's office.

07:29.366 --> 07:30.572
I'm gonna admit
that I totally screwed up,

07:30.617 --> 07:31.902
and I'm gonna look incompetent
on the stand,

07:31.952 --> 07:33.067
and then I'm gonna watch
as the murderer goes free.

07:33.119 --> 07:34.404
Why don't I do that?

07:34.454 --> 07:36.035
- Ohh, I don't feel good.
- Oh.

07:36.081 --> 07:38.072
All right. Okay. All right, all right.

07:38.124 --> 07:39.580
Yeah, ljust gotta drop
these files off, and I'm--

07:39.626 --> 07:41.162
Did you bring the... thing?

07:43.630 --> 07:45.962
You look like hell. What's up?

07:49.803 --> 07:51.259
Wh--

07:51.304 --> 07:52.885
(Sam) I knew a guy
that used to do this impression.

07:52.931 --> 07:54.341
He could do it like he was hanging,

07:54.391 --> 07:57.258
like, uh, his neck was broken,
you know? Like this. (laughs)

07:57.310 --> 07:58.299
(laughs)

07:58.353 --> 07:59.468
Officer Swarek.

07:59.521 --> 08:00.761
McNaIly, ready to go?

08:00.814 --> 08:02.645
- Uh, yeah, about that--
- See ya.

08:02.691 --> 08:04.272
- ljust--
- Yeah, is there a problem?

08:04.317 --> 08:05.306
- No.
- Good.

08:05.360 --> 08:06.816
- Well, yeah, actually.
- Yeah?

08:06.861 --> 08:08.817
Yeah, because I think we really need
to lay some ground rules.

08:08.863 --> 08:11.991
I drive. You shut up. Sound good?

08:12.033 --> 08:15.116
Look, I know the manual doesn't really cover
whatever our situation is,

08:15.161 --> 08:18.619
but I do think that
if we just act polite, okay--

08:18.665 --> 08:21.782
not fake polite, real polite--
and we act as friends

08:21.835 --> 08:23.951
and--and share the driving,

08:24.004 --> 08:25.289
then this will go just fine.

08:25.338 --> 08:26.953
What are you saying?
You want to be my friend?

08:27.007 --> 08:28.668
(siren wailing)

08:28.717 --> 08:31.629
Okay. I'll pretend you're Traci.
You pretend I'm Oliver.

08:31.678 --> 08:33.464
Okay. Get in.

08:33.513 --> 08:34.878
I'm driving...

08:35.932 --> 08:37.172
friend.

08:42.522 --> 08:44.729
(Sam sighs)

08:44.774 --> 08:47.265
(engine starts)

08:47.318 --> 08:50.401
So... Sudbury--the big nickel.

08:50.447 --> 08:52.312
I mean, that's what
the town's known for, right?

08:52.365 --> 08:54.651
A big nickel shaped like a... big--

08:54.701 --> 08:57.784
Nickel. Yeah.
Giant chump change.

08:57.829 --> 09:00.696
We're going to pick up a prisoner
named Ray Donald Swann--

09:00.749 --> 09:03.240
small-time drug dealer,
witnessed a double murder.

09:03.293 --> 09:05.204
We're bringing him in to testify.

09:05.253 --> 09:06.834
So what, five hours there,
five hours back?

09:06.880 --> 09:08.711
Not the way I drive.

09:08.757 --> 09:12.170
(tires peal)

09:18.224 --> 09:21.136
So this prisoner that we're
picking up at Sudbury Jail...

09:21.186 --> 09:22.266
Ray Donald Swann.

09:22.312 --> 09:23.518
Yeah, what's his story?

09:23.563 --> 09:25.019
Found in a basement apartment

09:25.065 --> 09:27.397
with a half kilo of coke
and two dead dealers.

09:27.442 --> 09:29.353
Dealers were shot in the face.

09:29.402 --> 09:31.063
Must've ripped somebody off big time.

09:31.112 --> 09:35.230
Swann was there partying--
a no-no, 'cause he's on parole.

09:35.283 --> 09:37.695
Swann was a bystander,
lucky to be alive.

09:37.744 --> 09:40.110
Oh, so we'rejust bringing him back
to testify against the shooter.

09:40.163 --> 09:42.119
He was the only eyewitness,
cut a deal.

09:42.165 --> 09:43.530
He's getting a year off his sentence.

09:43.583 --> 09:46.791
Oh, pfft.
You know, I hate plea deals.

09:46.836 --> 09:48.337
Happens all the time.

09:48.379 --> 09:50.870
I know, but, you know,
itjust doesn't make it right.

09:50.924 --> 09:53.461
Just part of the dirtbag food chain.

09:54.427 --> 09:55.667
What about Anton Hill?

09:55.720 --> 09:57.881
All that work that you put in
undercover, you know,

09:57.931 --> 09:59.887
you'd be pissed if he got flipped
for a lighter sentence.

09:59.933 --> 10:01.514
I never actually got Hill, remember?

10:01.559 --> 10:03.060
So not really relevant.

10:03.103 --> 10:06.220
- Yeah, but, you know--
- Try not to overthink it.

10:06.272 --> 10:09.514
(scoffs) You compartmentalize
a lot, don't you?

10:10.318 --> 10:13.355
We're friends,
so I'm gonna let that slide.

10:18.409 --> 10:21.321
So this prisoner, Swann--
is he dangerous?

10:21.371 --> 10:23.987
If he was, do you think
they'd be sending you with me?

10:24.040 --> 10:25.951
- You know what?
- What?

10:26.668 --> 10:27.908
I'm gonna let that slide.

10:27.961 --> 10:29.292
- Are we done talking?
- Yes.

10:29.337 --> 10:30.372
Good.

10:34.050 --> 10:35.586
- (Dov) What's wrong with you?
- Huh?

10:35.635 --> 10:37.296
You break Chris's heart.
You won't talk to him.

10:37.345 --> 10:38.334
You know he's fragile.

10:38.388 --> 10:39.548
What do you care?

10:40.598 --> 10:41.713
Who are you?

10:41.766 --> 10:44.428
(slurps loudly)

10:44.477 --> 10:46.763
Is it supposed to be
a full moon tonight or what?

10:46.813 --> 10:48.053
Why? Is it crazy out there?

10:48.106 --> 10:50.597
No, no, no, honey.
Crazy does not begin to describe it.

10:50.650 --> 10:51.810
You're not gonna believe
what I just brought in.

10:51.860 --> 10:53.441
- Well, try me.
- All right.

10:53.486 --> 10:55.101
Got this call to a house on Brock.

10:55.155 --> 10:58.192
8-year-old boy is kicking a soccer ball
around his backyard,

10:58.241 --> 10:59.356
finds a male, fully naked...

10:59.409 --> 11:01.070
- Oh.
- sleeping in the geraniums.

11:01.119 --> 11:03.110
He runs inside.
His mom calls it in, hysterical.

11:03.163 --> 11:04.278
Right. Welcome to the neighborhood.

11:04.330 --> 11:05.945
- Mm.
- Yeah, guy's wasted, right?

11:05.999 --> 11:08.615
Mm-mm. No, no, no.
See, this is the full-moon part.

11:08.668 --> 11:10.283
I shake him. He comes to.

11:10.336 --> 11:12.292
He's lucid, but he says
he can't remember his name.

11:12.338 --> 11:13.453
He have ID?

11:13.506 --> 11:15.747
- Nada.
- Nada.

11:15.800 --> 11:17.131
A filthy, naked John Doe.

11:17.177 --> 11:19.964
That sounds like a job for...

11:20.013 --> 11:22.470
- (singsongy) Peck, Epstein!
- Peck-stein!

11:22.515 --> 11:24.892
I kinda like the sound of that, actually.

11:24.934 --> 11:27.186
Uh, rookies, find our John Doe some clothes.

11:33.526 --> 11:34.641
Little Miss Put-upon.

11:34.694 --> 11:36.309
- What is going on over there?
- Wow.

11:40.533 --> 11:41.773
Hey.

11:41.826 --> 11:43.487
- Hey.
- Hey. Hi.

11:43.536 --> 11:45.242
| feel so naked without my gun.

11:45.288 --> 11:46.277
- (chuckles) Yeah.
- Yeah.

11:46.331 --> 11:47.320
So--So what are you guys up to?

11:47.373 --> 11:49.409
Baby-sitting a John Doe for Noelle.

11:49.459 --> 11:52.201
Yeah, he says he's got amnesia.
It's very soap opera.

11:52.253 --> 11:53.868
- Oh.
- Where are you guys headed?

11:53.922 --> 11:55.412
Uh, interview room.

11:55.465 --> 11:57.126
Sounds interesting.

11:57.175 --> 11:58.164
(laughs) It's not.

11:58.218 --> 11:59.503
Yeah, most--most definitely not...

11:59.552 --> 12:00.541
- Yeah
- ...interesting.

12:00.595 --> 12:01.710
- So see ya.
- (Chris) See ya.

12:05.183 --> 12:07.219
Okay, so we gathered up
all the information

12:07.268 --> 12:08.474
that might pertain
to the double murder.

12:08.519 --> 12:09.850
We'll go through
all the witness statements,

12:09.896 --> 12:11.511
- all the evidence.
- Yeah, we'll help you remember.

12:11.564 --> 12:13.850
l have to testify
in less than 24 hours,

12:13.900 --> 12:15.606
and it isn't just about the facts.

12:15.652 --> 12:17.108
I gotta bring them into the room--

12:17.153 --> 12:19.314
you know, the way the bodies
were laid out in relation to the door,

12:19.364 --> 12:20.524
how many windows there were,

12:20.573 --> 12:22.564
how the room smelled,
how the light came--

12:22.617 --> 12:24.357
You gotta testify about
the way the room smelled?

12:24.410 --> 12:26.947
Yeah, sure, if asked.
There is a killer on trial,

12:26.996 --> 12:30.363
and if I look at all unsure about
what happened, he might walk.

12:30.416 --> 12:32.247
Okay, well, let's--
let's put it all together.

12:32.293 --> 12:33.499
Just--You put us in the room.

12:33.544 --> 12:35.375
- Yeah, we'll do whatever it takes.
- Okay, great.

12:35.421 --> 12:37.036
- Take this. Go through that.
- Sure.

12:37.090 --> 12:38.296
- All right.
- You take that. You go through that.

12:38.341 --> 12:39.706
- Okay.
- Okay.

12:41.219 --> 12:44.211
Hey, what kind of music do you like
listening to when you drive?

12:44.264 --> 12:46.801
Nothing. I like to be alone
with my thoughts.

12:46.849 --> 12:48.385
Hmm. What thoughts?

12:48.434 --> 12:51.016
My own private thoughts.

12:51.062 --> 12:52.347
Okay, like, what's one of them?

12:52.397 --> 12:53.728
Are you allergic to silence?

12:53.773 --> 12:55.183
(laughs)
What are you talking about?

12:55.233 --> 12:56.723
l'm silent all the time.

12:56.776 --> 12:57.982
Good.

13:00.154 --> 13:01.735
I know what you're doing, okay.

13:01.781 --> 13:03.021
Who can stay quiet the longest?

13:04.117 --> 13:05.402
(sighs loudly)

13:05.451 --> 13:08.158
Come on. What kind of music
do you like listening to?

13:08.204 --> 13:09.819
Rush. I'm a big Rush fan.

13:09.872 --> 13:10.907
Who?

13:10.957 --> 13:12.197
Yeah, I like The Who.

13:12.250 --> 13:13.740
Classic rock, you know.

13:15.086 --> 13:16.075
All right, scan around.

13:16.129 --> 13:18.040
Find me some Free.

13:18.089 --> 13:19.420
Free?

13:19.465 --> 13:20.671
(static)

13:20.717 --> 13:22.708
(radio frequencies tuning)

13:23.928 --> 13:24.917
Give me that.

13:24.971 --> 13:25.960
Oh. I...

13:27.724 --> 13:28.964
Okay.

13:29.017 --> 13:31.554
- Wh-Whoa! Okay.
- Mr. Doe...

13:31.602 --> 13:34.264
uh,anyluck,
uh, remembering that name?

13:34.314 --> 13:35.429
No, sir. Nothing.

13:35.481 --> 13:37.733
Uh, how about an address?

13:37.775 --> 13:39.731
Wish I could help ya.

13:39.777 --> 13:41.483
Date of birth?

13:41.529 --> 13:44.862
Okay, we're--we're obliged to contact
Mapleview Mental Health,

13:44.907 --> 13:47.990
so, I mean,
maybe they can help you out.

13:49.704 --> 13:51.069
Wh-What's he doing?

13:51.873 --> 13:54.785
I try not to ask.
Officer Epstein?

13:54.834 --> 13:56.335
Don't worry, Mr. Doe.

13:56.377 --> 13:58.709
We're gonna figure out who you are.

13:58.755 --> 14:01.371
Follow me, buddy. Let's roll.

14:06.179 --> 14:07.294
You hungry?

14:07.347 --> 14:09.838
Yes, definitely.

14:10.350 --> 14:12.181
- Care where?
- No, no. I'm easy.

14:14.020 --> 14:15.726
Diner, it is.

14:17.023 --> 14:20.015
(indistinct conversations)

14:23.654 --> 14:25.360
Okay, this is really awkward.

14:26.616 --> 14:28.402
Are we not gonna talk at all?

14:30.036 --> 14:31.071
You wanna talk?

14:31.120 --> 14:32.451
Yeah.

14:32.497 --> 14:34.328
All right. Let's talk
about the job we're on.

14:34.374 --> 14:36.490
There's some basic rules
for picking up a prisoner.

14:36.542 --> 14:37.998
- All right.
- (clears throat)

14:38.044 --> 14:39.705
Don't get too cozy with 'em,

14:39.754 --> 14:42.120
always assume the body is dangerous,

14:42.173 --> 14:44.334
and treat him the same as he treats you.

14:46.386 --> 14:47.717
Great.

14:53.935 --> 14:55.471
Well, I mean, at least
the drive is pretty--

14:56.562 --> 14:58.814
the leaves and--
and the colors of the...

15:00.233 --> 15:01.439
- leaves and stuff.
- You know,

15:01.484 --> 15:02.940
you're the one
who's making this awkward.

15:02.985 --> 15:04.691
I'm doing everything I can
just to make this feel

15:04.737 --> 15:06.853
even a little bit normal.
(silverware clatters)

15:06.906 --> 15:08.567
You know what? You're stubborn.

15:08.616 --> 15:11.403
Forget it. I give up. I quit.

15:11.452 --> 15:13.443
It's not like it can get
more awkward anyway.

15:15.873 --> 15:18.410
Miss! Miss.

15:19.919 --> 15:20.908
Problem here, officer?

15:20.962 --> 15:22.793
There's a problem with my BLT.

15:22.839 --> 15:23.874
- Really?
- Yeah.

15:23.923 --> 15:25.129
I think you better call a ham-bulance.

15:28.594 --> 15:29.709
Can I get you anything else?

15:29.762 --> 15:32.629
Well, my partner here was wondering
if you have any hen-ways on the menu?

15:32.682 --> 15:33.671
What's a hen-way?

15:33.724 --> 15:34.713
About 3 pounds.

15:34.767 --> 15:37.554
(laughs)

15:37.603 --> 15:39.980
I'm sorry.

15:42.525 --> 15:44.516
You're such an idiot.

15:45.611 --> 15:46.862
But still feeling awkward?

15:57.957 --> 16:00.414
I gotta say,
I did not expect ham-bulance

16:00.460 --> 16:01.745
from someone like you.

16:01.794 --> 16:02.909
Someone like me?

16:02.962 --> 16:05.795
Yeah. You're just so serious
all the time.

16:05.840 --> 16:07.922
See? I hate that.

16:07.967 --> 16:09.047
What?

16:09.093 --> 16:11.379
"Why is Sam always so serious?"

16:11.429 --> 16:12.919
I been getting that my whole life.

16:12.972 --> 16:14.382
When I was in third grade,

16:14.432 --> 16:16.514
I went out and bought
the biggestjoke book on Earth.

16:16.559 --> 16:18.595
(laughs) Yeah,
obviously memorized it.

16:18.644 --> 16:20.054
All 101 jokes.

16:20.104 --> 16:21.264
(laughs)

16:21.314 --> 16:23.555
Couldn't even
make my own sister laugh.

16:24.901 --> 16:26.186
You got a sister?

16:26.235 --> 16:28.442
Yeah, Sarah.
She lives in St. Catherine's.

16:28.488 --> 16:29.477
Oh.

16:31.657 --> 16:33.443
Well, it was a long time ago,

16:33.493 --> 16:36.576
so maybe you just need
a newjoke book.

16:52.011 --> 16:54.218
(dog barking in distance)

16:56.682 --> 16:58.718
(Sam sighs)

16:58.768 --> 17:02.135
(Andy) I've never done this before--
transport a prisoner.

17:02.188 --> 17:04.099
I've never been friends
with a woman before.

17:04.148 --> 17:07.015
(laughs) Well, they sent me,
so how bad can it be?

17:07.068 --> 17:08.649
Let's go find out.

17:10.947 --> 17:13.563
You know, for a guy with his sheet,
he's not too bad.

17:13.616 --> 17:15.277
Polite, at least.

17:15.326 --> 17:17.237
Good to know. Thanks, brother.

17:17.286 --> 17:19.823
Yeah, no problem, man. Good luck.

17:19.872 --> 17:21.703
Mr. Swann, l'm Officer McNally.

17:21.749 --> 17:23.285
- Hey.
- This is Officer Swarek.

17:23.334 --> 17:25.370
We're gonna be escorting you
to the prosecutor's office.

17:25.419 --> 17:26.579
Turn around.

17:27.797 --> 17:28.957
Friends call me Ray.

17:30.216 --> 17:31.672
We're not your friends.

17:31.717 --> 17:33.093
(Ray) Not yet.

17:33.135 --> 17:34.124
See ya, Ray.

17:34.178 --> 17:35.384
(Ray) See you later.

17:38.558 --> 17:41.550
Hey, thanks a lot for letting me
have the cuffs up front.

17:41.602 --> 17:42.591
'Preciate that.

17:42.645 --> 17:44.510
Yeah, no problem.
It's a long ride.

17:44.564 --> 17:48.682
No, no, really.
It was a nice thing to do.

17:48.734 --> 17:51.020
So, uh, how long
have you been a cop there,

17:51.070 --> 17:52.731
Officer Mc... What?

17:52.780 --> 17:54.020
- What was it?
- McNally.

17:54.073 --> 17:55.938
- Oh, yeah.
- Um, uh, not too long.

17:55.992 --> 17:58.028
- You like it?
- Yeah, some days.

17:58.077 --> 17:59.408
I guess it's like anyjob, huh?

17:59.453 --> 18:00.954
- Yeah.
- Got its ups and downs.

18:00.997 --> 18:02.953
Yeah? What do you know
about having a job?

18:02.999 --> 18:04.864
Oh, hey, man,
before I got picked up,

18:04.917 --> 18:06.953
l was apprenticing
for a tool and die maker.

18:07.003 --> 18:09.665
l was trying
to put the past behind me.

18:10.214 --> 18:12.079
Guess you could say
we're both newbies.

18:12.925 --> 18:14.631
That's enough talking, McNally.

18:14.677 --> 18:17.339
Huh? Oh. (whispers) Sorry.

18:17.388 --> 18:18.924
Didn't mean to get you in trouble there.

18:19.515 --> 18:20.880
Not allowed to talk.

18:20.933 --> 18:22.889
(normal voice)
That's the way you roll, right, chief?

18:22.935 --> 18:25.472
Strong, silent type. I can tell.

18:25.521 --> 18:26.977
Like to build up a mystique,

18:27.023 --> 18:29.139
keep those ladies thinking
there's a lot more going on

18:29.191 --> 18:31.807
behind those smoldering eyes
than there really is, huh?

18:32.445 --> 18:34.401
(laughs) How am I doing,
Officer McNally?

18:36.949 --> 18:39.565
Right on the money, I bet.

18:39.619 --> 18:41.109
No offense, man, but, you know,

18:41.162 --> 18:44.074
th-there are other ways
to deal with people.

18:44.123 --> 18:45.533
I don't mean to be a jerk.

18:45.583 --> 18:48.871
It's just that, you know,
every moment offers you

18:48.919 --> 18:51.535
the opportunity to find out
something new about yourself.

18:51.589 --> 18:55.832
The Buddhists, you know,
they call it a "beginner's mind."

18:55.885 --> 18:59.673
Ah, see? I see that skeptical
look there, John Wayne.

18:59.722 --> 19:03.635
But a beginner,
they see all possibilities.

19:03.684 --> 19:05.094
An expert--few.

19:05.144 --> 19:08.261
You should be proud and happy
that you're a beginner.

19:08.314 --> 19:10.646
Why don't we all begin to shut up?

19:11.817 --> 19:14.559
Ray Swann was in the corner in cuffs.

19:14.612 --> 19:17.695
We had two bodies on the ground,
multiple gunshot wounds.

19:17.740 --> 19:19.480
There was cocaine on the table.

19:19.533 --> 19:20.784
Oh, no. Hold on. No, it wasn't--

19:20.826 --> 19:23.693
lt--Where--Uh...
it--it was on the dresser.

19:23.746 --> 19:25.077
-And then...
- Um...

19:25.122 --> 19:26.862
What?

19:26.916 --> 19:28.201
Come on.

19:28.250 --> 19:30.957
Whoa. Oh, sorry, Bud.
Uh, I'm using this room.

19:31.003 --> 19:31.992
Thanks, man.

19:36.300 --> 19:37.415
Come on.

19:40.596 --> 19:42.712
Okay. Uh...

19:42.765 --> 19:43.800
I came in.

19:43.849 --> 19:44.964
Okay.

19:46.310 --> 19:48.096
Followed by Detective Callaghan.

19:48.145 --> 19:50.010
Okay, so...
it's a basement apartment,

19:50.064 --> 19:51.053
so should I duck?

19:51.107 --> 19:52.847
Sure. Whatever.
That'd be great.

19:54.694 --> 19:56.059
(imitating Luke) Jerry.

19:56.112 --> 19:57.977
(imitating Jerry)
Luke, hey, brother.

19:58.030 --> 19:59.736
This looks like a double homicide.

19:59.782 --> 20:00.771
Double trouble.

20:00.825 --> 20:04.158
- Okay, stop. Uh...
- Yeah.

20:04.203 --> 20:05.613
I wouldn't say something like that.

20:05.663 --> 20:06.823
(normal voice)
You totally would.

20:06.872 --> 20:08.533
But I didn't.

20:08.582 --> 20:09.662
What did you say?

20:10.751 --> 20:13.493
You know what?
This isn't, uh, gonna work for me.

20:13.546 --> 20:14.831
Am I not convincing enough?

20:14.880 --> 20:16.131
- Jerry, what are we missing?
- I thought I was--

20:16.173 --> 20:17.629
I don't know! That's the point.

20:17.675 --> 20:20.087
Fine. Okay.

20:20.136 --> 20:23.845
I'm just gonna go through
all the evidence again,

20:23.889 --> 20:26.631
and I'll be in the squad room,
trying to help you.

20:26.684 --> 20:28.766
(door opens)

20:28.811 --> 20:30.847
So should I take it from the top?

20:30.896 --> 20:31.885
(door closes)

20:31.939 --> 20:32.928
No.

20:33.899 --> 20:35.230
Oh.

20:35.568 --> 20:38.310
I don't see any photo ID
or fingerprint matches.

20:38.362 --> 20:39.693
No missing person reports.

20:39.739 --> 20:42.606
How can someone just not exist
like this? It's insane.

20:42.658 --> 20:44.023
Yeah. Whatever.

20:44.076 --> 20:45.361
Oh, excuse me.

20:45.411 --> 20:47.697
Don't let my real police work
get in the way with, uh,

20:47.747 --> 20:48.827
whatever it is you're doing.

20:48.873 --> 20:50.704
You know, I'm actually doing my work.

20:50.750 --> 20:51.910
l'm filling out papenNork,

20:51.959 --> 20:54.166
and I'm admitting this guy to Mapleview,

20:54.211 --> 20:56.543
and in two hours, he's their problem.

20:56.589 --> 20:59.251
Roger that. I'm gonna see
if I can get any hits on the description.

20:59.300 --> 21:01.382
Would you say
his eyes are brown or hazel?

21:01.427 --> 21:03.088
Dov, this is an EDP call.

21:03.137 --> 21:06.004
I mean, if he is faking it,
he's pathological.

21:06.056 --> 21:07.387
If he actually has amnesia,

21:07.433 --> 21:09.549
that's a mental health issue.
It's not our problem.

21:09.602 --> 21:11.058
How can you not be excited about this?

21:11.103 --> 21:14.140
I mean, this is a mystery.
We're cops. We solve mysteries.

21:14.190 --> 21:16.226
No, we don't. We serve, protect

21:16.275 --> 21:18.106
and hopefully get our frickin' guns back.

21:18.152 --> 21:19.267
Just trying to seize the day here.

21:19.320 --> 21:21.311
Unlike you, if I want to make detective,

21:21.363 --> 21:23.399
I'm gonna have to actually work for a living.

21:26.160 --> 21:28.367
Why do men always wait
until the last minute

21:28.412 --> 21:29.948
- to fill up with gas?
- It wasn't the last minute.

21:29.997 --> 21:31.862
Yeah, it was empty.
We would've been running on fumes

21:31.916 --> 21:32.905
the rest of the way home.

21:32.958 --> 21:34.823
Needle on empty means a quarter tank.

21:34.877 --> 21:35.866
No one asked you.

21:35.920 --> 21:37.456
Empty means empty.

21:37.505 --> 21:38.995
You know, it's a good thing
we're friends,

21:39.048 --> 21:41.505
because this would be a major bone
of contention between us.

21:41.550 --> 21:43.051
You guys aren't friends.

21:44.303 --> 21:45.292
Yeah, we are.

21:45.346 --> 21:47.211
Ah, come on. Look,
you got nothing in common.

21:48.057 --> 21:50.173
Then there's the power dynamic, right?

21:50.226 --> 21:53.013
I mean, you gotta
boss her around all the time.

21:54.438 --> 21:56.599
You're running around,
trying to please him at every turn.

21:56.649 --> 21:58.605
(laughs) No, I'm not.

21:58.651 --> 22:00.858
Ah, he's got a lot of expectations.

22:00.903 --> 22:02.894
You kinda feel like you
owe him something, don't ya?

22:05.241 --> 22:08.324
Well, let me tell ya.
Friends, they don't owe.

22:08.369 --> 22:09.700
They do 'cause they want to do.

22:09.745 --> 22:12.077
lfl buy you a hot dog,
will you shut up?

22:12.122 --> 22:15.364
Put mustard on it? Please?

22:15.417 --> 22:17.453
Hejust likes silence.

22:18.671 --> 22:22.129
Hey, how long you guys
been sleeping together?

22:22.174 --> 22:24.085
What? No, we're not.

22:24.134 --> 22:25.465
No, we're friends.

22:25.511 --> 22:26.876
ljust...

22:26.929 --> 22:29.170
I'm gonna pay for the gas.

22:40.442 --> 22:42.023
Why didn't you just go
at the gas station?

22:43.654 --> 22:45.394
Because the men's room is out of order.

22:45.447 --> 22:46.857
Okay, so then go in the women's.

22:46.907 --> 22:48.613
Yeah, nothing looks better
than a uniformed cop

22:48.659 --> 22:50.069
skulking out of the ladies' room.

22:55.541 --> 22:58.374
All right. I'll be back in two minutes.

22:58.419 --> 23:00.535
Don't talk to the prisoner.
Don't get out of the car.

23:00.588 --> 23:01.998
Don't do anything. All right?

23:09.305 --> 23:12.297
(grunting)

23:14.810 --> 23:16.766
(gulping and gasping)

23:16.812 --> 23:18.973
(voice straining) Was there
peanut oil in the hot dog?

23:19.023 --> 23:21.639
- Why, are you allergic?
- Okay, there's an epi

23:21.692 --> 23:22.727
in the medikit. Just hold on.

23:27.406 --> 23:29.567
(gasping)

23:36.916 --> 23:37.905
I screwed up.

23:37.958 --> 23:39.368
Yeah, you lost the prisoner!

23:39.418 --> 23:41.409
Okay, we gotta get him back now!

23:41.462 --> 23:43.293
I didn't think
he would try anything like that.

23:43.339 --> 23:45.546
Yeah, clearly! You know,
you've been talking to him all morning

23:45.591 --> 23:48.082
like he's your best friend!
Since we got in that car,

23:48.135 --> 23:49.841
you've been more interested
in making friends

23:49.887 --> 23:51.593
than getting this job done right!

23:51.639 --> 23:54.130
Look, you told me to treat him
like he treats me. I did.

23:54.183 --> 23:57.050
This isn't a tea party
with your friggin' dolls, McNally!

23:57.102 --> 24:00.185
And you don't open the door
when the prisoner's feet are facing you.

24:00.230 --> 24:01.265
That, you should know!

24:01.315 --> 24:03.727
You overthink every little thing,

24:03.776 --> 24:06.438
but when something matters,
you don't think at all.

24:07.112 --> 24:08.648
Well, we've got to call for backup.

24:08.697 --> 24:10.608
Yeah, and tell 'em what?
We lost the prisoner

24:10.658 --> 24:11.773
'cause he was choking on a hot dog?

24:12.284 --> 24:14.366
Besides, it'll take two hours
before they get here.

24:14.411 --> 24:15.526
It'll be dark. He'll be gone.

24:15.579 --> 24:17.240
Hey, I'm sorry.

24:17.289 --> 24:20.156
If we don't get this guy back
before nightfall, we're screwed.

24:20.209 --> 24:22.871
Well, then let's go.

24:22.920 --> 24:25.912
(birds chirping and warbling)

24:29.969 --> 24:31.925
Maybe you should just come clean,

24:31.971 --> 24:34.713
you know, tell the prosecutor
you lost your notes or--

24:36.308 --> 24:37.343
Or not.

24:39.353 --> 24:42.720
So? I mean,
don't you remember seeing it?

24:42.773 --> 24:44.104
When would I have seen it?

24:44.149 --> 24:45.980
Um, maybe last weekend.

24:46.026 --> 24:47.687
Are you blaming this on the fact

24:47.736 --> 24:49.146
that Leo and I stayed at your place?

24:49.196 --> 24:50.811
I don't know.
Is it a coincidence

24:50.864 --> 24:52.400
that the first time
you guys stay over,

24:52.449 --> 24:54.565
your son draws on my freshly
painted living room walls,

24:54.618 --> 24:56.233
and my notebook goes missing?

24:56.286 --> 24:59.198
Jerry, I don't think that's the reason
your notes are missing.

24:59.248 --> 25:00.533
I mean, friggin' Leo
might be using my notes

25:00.582 --> 25:01.913
as a coloring book as we speak.

25:01.959 --> 25:03.790
Excuse me! "Friggin' Leo"?

25:03.836 --> 25:04.825
I could just go.

25:04.878 --> 25:06.618
Oh, come on, Traci.
You gotta admit

25:06.672 --> 25:08.754
the kid doesn't exactly
pick up after himself, right?

25:08.799 --> 25:09.914
He's 6.

25:10.509 --> 25:12.170
Okay, he's 6.

25:13.595 --> 25:15.131
(sighs deeply)

25:15.180 --> 25:16.295
You know, it'sjust
when we were married,

25:16.348 --> 25:18.839
my wife took care
of these things and...

25:21.687 --> 25:22.847
(door closes)

25:22.896 --> 25:25.148
I think | might've played that one
a little differently.

25:26.108 --> 25:27.314
You know what, Diaz? You're right.

25:27.359 --> 25:28.599
Oh.

25:28.652 --> 25:30.938
I'm gonna call the prosecutor.

25:30.988 --> 25:33.980
(birds chirping and warbling)

25:47.463 --> 25:49.670
He went that way.

25:49.715 --> 25:51.831
No, don't touch that!
It's poison oak.

25:51.884 --> 25:54.170
Wow, haven't spent much time
in the country, have you?

25:54.219 --> 25:56.631
I don't own a fishing cabin,
if that's what you mean.

25:56.680 --> 25:57.840
I'm a city boy, McNally.

25:57.890 --> 25:59.551
I can fix your car
blindfolded and cuffed.

26:01.435 --> 26:04.051
Would you care to participate
in this little manhunt?

26:07.066 --> 26:08.602
(sighs)

26:16.408 --> 26:19.320
(sighs) Wait, wait, wait.

26:19.369 --> 26:20.358
W-Wait a second.

26:20.412 --> 26:21.401
What?

26:24.041 --> 26:25.326
Ugh.

26:26.376 --> 26:28.367
Are those Swann's handcuffs?

26:28.420 --> 26:30.661
(click) No, McNally.
They fell off a freakin' beaver.

26:30.714 --> 26:33.922
Call the ham-bulance. (sighs)

26:35.177 --> 26:37.793
We're wandering around in the forest
like a couple of morons.

26:37.846 --> 26:39.802
This is--This is a nightmare.

26:39.848 --> 26:41.258
(Andy) It's getting dark.

26:42.476 --> 26:45.092
We've got an hour left
of decent daylight.

26:45.646 --> 26:48.103
(panting) Sam,
what if we don't find him?

26:52.111 --> 26:53.897
- We'll find him.
- What if we don't?

26:55.823 --> 26:57.233
I don't know.

26:57.282 --> 26:59.534
You'll get thrown under a bus.
I'll get thrown behind a desk.

27:04.498 --> 27:05.783
(branch creaks)

27:05.833 --> 27:07.073
- (mouths words)
- (lowered voice) What was that?

27:18.762 --> 27:19.922
- (grunts)
- Oh!

27:19.972 --> 27:21.382
Sorry, sorry!

27:21.431 --> 27:22.841
(whispers) Sorry. Let's...

27:26.478 --> 27:27.718
Yeah.

27:30.816 --> 27:33.398
(panting)

27:33.443 --> 27:36.185
Okay, home. Now don't think.

27:36.238 --> 27:38.024
What's the first thing
that pops into your head?

27:38.699 --> 27:41.156
- Family.
- Family? That's great.

27:41.201 --> 27:43.817
Uh, what does this family look like?
Don't--Don't think.

27:43.871 --> 27:47.204
Uh, there's a man and a woman
and, uh, some children,

27:47.249 --> 27:49.831
maybe a dog,
and they love each other--

27:49.877 --> 27:51.708
Okay, I told you he was faking it.
That-

27:51.753 --> 27:54.335
Mr. Doe, that's not a real family.

27:54.381 --> 27:55.370
We'll try again.

27:55.424 --> 27:58.336
Uh, occupation. Don't think.

27:58.385 --> 27:59.670
-Job.
-Job.

27:59.720 --> 28:01.051
Can you be more specific?

28:01.096 --> 28:02.256
Can you give me your hands?

28:03.473 --> 28:04.679
I'm not gonna bite it.

28:06.852 --> 28:08.433
Yeah, they're rough.
He uses these.

28:08.478 --> 28:11.606
All right. Blue-collar guy
with a nice family, huh?

28:11.648 --> 28:12.728
- Sounds pretty good to me.
- Yeah.

28:12.774 --> 28:14.605
- Sign me up.
- Oh, more good news.

28:14.651 --> 28:16.733
I ran your prints,
and from what we can tell,

28:16.778 --> 28:18.063
you don't have a criminal record.

28:18.113 --> 28:20.104
- Really?
- Does that surprise you?

28:20.157 --> 28:22.944
Well, you gotta wonder about a guy
who winds up naked in a flower bed.

28:22.993 --> 28:25.609
Okay, Mr. Doe,
I have finished your papenNork,

28:25.662 --> 28:27.243
so you can go with the people
from Mapleview now.

28:27.289 --> 28:29.325
Whoa. Whoa. Excuse me.

28:29.374 --> 28:31.114
What are you doing?
We're not done here yet.

28:31.168 --> 28:33.910
We still have more word association
exercises to do.

28:33.962 --> 28:35.748
I really appreciate your efforts, officer,

28:35.797 --> 28:39.631
but |--| don't think--
I don't think we're gonna get there.

28:39.676 --> 28:41.507
Okay. Um...

28:41.553 --> 28:45.011
l'll, uh... I'll keep running
identity searches, and, uh--

28:45.057 --> 28:46.843
but don't think
I'm gonna forget about you.

28:46.892 --> 28:48.473
But if I do figure out who I am,

28:48.518 --> 28:50.600
I hope I'm as good a guy as you are.

28:51.605 --> 28:52.845
But, hey, maybe that's why

28:52.898 --> 28:54.980
nobody's filed
any missing persons report.

28:55.025 --> 28:57.061
Maybe nobody wants to find me.

28:57.110 --> 28:59.601
I could be a real jerk, right?

28:59.655 --> 29:04.240
Might be a blessing
not being whoever l was, right?

29:16.922 --> 29:19.584
Wow. You take such detailed notes.

29:20.759 --> 29:21.999
You have to.

29:23.637 --> 29:25.593
You know, the first time | testified...

29:25.639 --> 29:27.129
(grunts)

29:27.182 --> 29:30.766
I got in the box,
and right as I started talking,

29:30.811 --> 29:34.303
I realized that | forgot to put
the accused's name in my notes.

29:35.190 --> 29:37.101
- No way.
- Yeah. I couldn't lie about it, either.

29:37.818 --> 29:39.558
Your notes are your notes.

29:39.611 --> 29:41.317
You don't get to rewrite history.

29:44.491 --> 29:45.901
Uh...

29:45.951 --> 29:47.816
- Detective Barber?
- Hmm?

29:47.869 --> 29:49.734
The guy you arrested for the murders--

29:49.788 --> 29:52.029
his prints were on the gun, right?

29:52.082 --> 29:54.414
Yeah. Otherwise,
we wouldn't have made the case.

29:54.459 --> 29:56.165
Well, it's just that...

29:56.211 --> 29:58.702
the numbers on these ldent forms
are different.

30:00.465 --> 30:01.841
What?
(papers rustle)

30:01.883 --> 30:03.714
Here at the top corner, uh,

30:03.760 --> 30:05.591
these catalogue numbers
should match, right?

30:05.637 --> 30:06.626
Because they're copies.

30:06.680 --> 30:08.762
But the last two numbers are different.

30:08.807 --> 30:10.638
Yeah, you're right.
ldent mislabeled it.

30:12.352 --> 30:13.341
Oh, no.

30:13.395 --> 30:14.760
What?

30:15.939 --> 30:18.851
Ray Swann had a weapon,
but he didn't fire it.

30:18.900 --> 30:20.765
The ldent report
should've had Ray Swann's prints

30:20.819 --> 30:21.808
on the murder weapon.

30:21.862 --> 30:23.898
The--The witness is the shooter?

30:23.947 --> 30:25.483
He's our killer.

30:25.532 --> 30:28.023
Come on, Sammy, pick up.

30:28.076 --> 30:31.068
(birds chirping and warbling)

30:36.376 --> 30:37.832
(branch creaks)

30:38.837 --> 30:39.826
That's gotta be him.

30:39.880 --> 30:41.290
He's trying to wait us out.

30:42.257 --> 30:44.168
(sighs) Once it gets dark,
he's home free.

30:44.634 --> 30:46.044
We gotta flush him out.

30:46.094 --> 30:47.083
What do you want me to do?

30:47.137 --> 30:48.627
What you do best, McNally.

30:48.680 --> 30:51.888
Okay.
Wait. Uh, what is that, exactly?

30:51.933 --> 30:53.218
Talk.

30:53.268 --> 30:55.133
Your mouth is your best weapon.

30:55.187 --> 30:56.893
Good coppers should be able
to talk themselves

30:56.938 --> 30:58.803
out of 98% of all confrontations.

30:58.857 --> 31:00.142
What about the other 2%?

31:00.192 --> 31:01.978
That's what I'm here for.

31:15.165 --> 31:16.701
Hey, Ray!

31:18.960 --> 31:20.666
I know you can hear me!

31:22.714 --> 31:23.794
You know you don't have a chance

31:23.840 --> 31:25.341
of getting out of these woods, right?

31:26.551 --> 31:30.419
I mean, K9 and SWAT
are already on their way!

31:32.265 --> 31:33.846
You have a plea deal.

31:33.892 --> 31:35.507
Okay, the second they get here,
that's gone.

31:35.560 --> 31:38.017
You're going back to jail.

31:38.063 --> 31:41.430
So let's just call them off,
Ray, seriously.

31:41.483 --> 31:43.474
Come out now!

31:43.527 --> 31:46.564
We'll just forget this whole thing!

31:46.613 --> 31:48.649
(panting)

31:51.410 --> 31:52.445
Sam!

32:53.013 --> 32:54.253
(footsteps rapidly approach)

32:54.306 --> 32:55.386
Unh!

32:56.975 --> 32:59.057
No. (gasps)

32:59.853 --> 33:01.093
Where's your partner?

33:01.146 --> 33:02.352
(panting)

33:02.397 --> 33:03.933
Where are those dogs?

33:03.982 --> 33:05.938
Shh, shh, shh. Shh.

33:05.984 --> 33:08.020
(muffled grunts)

33:08.069 --> 33:11.482
I'm just gonna squeeze, squeeze,
and you're gonna pass out.

33:11.531 --> 33:12.771
- (whimpering)
- (whispers) It's okay.

33:12.824 --> 33:14.109
Shh. It's okay.

33:14.159 --> 33:17.367
And then I'm gonna get your gun,
and you're not.

33:17.412 --> 33:19.277
(muffled cries)

33:22.834 --> 33:24.370
(grunting)

33:24.419 --> 33:25.829
(gasping loudly)

33:25.879 --> 33:29.167
(groans)
Aw, man. Ohh! Okay, okay.

33:29.216 --> 33:31.047
Okay, okay. Aah. My shoulder.

33:31.092 --> 33:34.459
(panting)

33:34.513 --> 33:36.629
You okay?

33:36.681 --> 33:40.640
Right as rain. How you doing?

33:40.685 --> 33:42.141
You're breaking my shoulder, man.

33:42.187 --> 33:43.677
You're breaking my heart, buddy.

33:43.730 --> 33:45.766
(groaning) Come on!
I want a lawyer.

33:45.815 --> 33:49.558
Yeah, we'll get right on that.
(handcuffs clicking)

33:49.611 --> 33:51.101
Oh, man, your knee!

33:51.154 --> 33:54.487
Okay, so Frank's letting us do
the recert end of shift,

33:54.533 --> 33:56.069
so chunk up, little man.

33:58.370 --> 34:01.112
Come on, are you still weepy
about Mr. Nobody?

34:01.164 --> 34:03.871
Wow. You really are that cold.

34:03.917 --> 34:08.001
Oh, right, and you're the bighearted
ambassador of goodwill, aren't you?

34:08.046 --> 34:09.707
You're such a hypocrite.

34:09.756 --> 34:11.337
Hypocrite?

34:11.383 --> 34:12.463
Yeah.

34:12.509 --> 34:14.215
A stranger walks in off the street.

34:14.719 --> 34:19.053
| work my butt off to be a nice guy
and try to figure out who he is.

34:19.099 --> 34:22.432
But not something
I'd expect you to understand.

34:22.477 --> 34:23.978
Get what?

34:24.020 --> 34:26.011
No, what, that it might be nice
to have a different past

34:26.064 --> 34:28.020
so nobody could hold it against you?

34:28.066 --> 34:30.978
So maybe your so-called friends
could see you as a fellow cop

34:31.027 --> 34:33.018
and not some white shirt
waiting to happen?

34:33.071 --> 34:34.982
(voice breaks) Yeah, Dov,
I really can't imagine that.

34:39.369 --> 34:40.358
(Andy inhales sharply)

34:40.412 --> 34:42.243
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

34:42.289 --> 34:45.156
I cannot wait to get back to civilization.

34:45.208 --> 34:47.244
You haven't done a lot of camping, huh?

34:47.294 --> 34:48.875
What, you mean like with a tent?

34:48.920 --> 34:51.411
Yeah. My dad used to take me
every summer.

34:51.464 --> 34:53.921
Told you,
I'm more of a city boy.

34:53.967 --> 34:57.380
In the summers, my sister and |
used to go to day camp--

34:57.429 --> 34:58.760
Parks and Rec.

35:00.724 --> 35:04.057
Did try to go to the beach this one time.

35:04.102 --> 35:07.845
We were on a bus
about a half an hour out of town, and...

35:07.897 --> 35:09.603
Sarah kind of freaked out.

35:09.649 --> 35:10.980
What, was she afraid of the water?

35:11.026 --> 35:13.733
She was afraid of, uh, everything.

35:13.778 --> 35:17.191
When she was 13, Sarah was
attacked by this group of guys.

35:20.452 --> 35:22.738
Yeah, pretty messed up by it.

35:22.787 --> 35:24.243
l was only 9 at the time.

35:24.289 --> 35:27.156
I didn't really get it, you know.

35:27.208 --> 35:28.709
Tried everything to cheer her up.

35:29.419 --> 35:30.875
Hence, the joke book.

35:30.920 --> 35:33.081
Yeah.

35:33.131 --> 35:34.337
Nothing really worked.

35:34.382 --> 35:36.043
You were 9 years old.

35:36.092 --> 35:37.673
I'm sure you did everything you could.

35:37.719 --> 35:41.462
She didn't, uh, need cheering up,

35:42.682 --> 35:44.513
just needed someone to protect her.

35:45.477 --> 35:47.183
So you became a cop.

35:54.069 --> 35:55.184
Your leg's good to go.

35:55.236 --> 35:56.442
You want to try
putting some weight on it?

35:56.488 --> 35:57.477
Yeah.

36:01.076 --> 36:03.237
It's great. Thank you.

36:06.998 --> 36:08.534
I'm really sorry
for freaking out on you.

36:09.000 --> 36:10.581
Hmm.

36:12.170 --> 36:13.159
Look”.

36:13.213 --> 36:15.169
whatever happened...

36:15.215 --> 36:16.580
between us...

36:19.386 --> 36:20.922
Uh...

36:20.970 --> 36:22.801
you know, Luke's a good guy.

36:22.847 --> 36:25.429
He's reliable, solid.

36:25.475 --> 36:26.806
He is.

36:26.851 --> 36:28.637
Yep. And a hell of a detective.

36:28.687 --> 36:32.271
Doesn't impose, doesn'tjudge,
just looks at the facts.

36:34.067 --> 36:37.025
Which is probably
what he's doing right now.

36:37.070 --> 36:38.731
Just give him some time.

36:40.615 --> 36:41.650
Yeah.

36:45.829 --> 36:46.818
Good to go?

36:46.871 --> 36:49.487
Yeah, as long as you drive.

36:59.134 --> 37:01.125
(siren wailing in distance)

37:14.649 --> 37:16.480
Detective Barber,

37:16.526 --> 37:18.187
this is Ray Donald Swann.

37:18.236 --> 37:19.601
(shackles clinking)

37:19.654 --> 37:24.148
He's a snake in the grass,
and he's, uh, all yours.

37:24.200 --> 37:25.576
Hello, Raymond.

37:25.618 --> 37:29.736
You're under arrest for the murder
of Mark Daniels and Carl Damaso.

37:29.789 --> 37:30.824
Let's go.

37:33.752 --> 37:35.743
(door buzzes, beeps)

37:38.590 --> 37:40.626
(sighs deeply)

37:42.719 --> 37:43.925
See you around, pal.

37:45.430 --> 37:47.921
See you around, buddy.

37:47.974 --> 37:49.805
(chuckles)

37:51.269 --> 37:52.679
(door buzzes, beeps)

37:57.108 --> 37:58.348
Have a good trip?

37:58.401 --> 37:59.982
You know what? You're an idiot.

38:00.987 --> 38:02.022
Excuse me?

38:03.448 --> 38:05.734
Nothing happened with McNally
that night.

38:05.784 --> 38:07.490
I tried. She shot me down.

38:07.535 --> 38:09.617
She's crazy about you.
Don't screw it up.

38:11.831 --> 38:12.820
(door closes)

38:14.459 --> 38:17.451
(indistinct conversations,
telephone ringing)

38:21.132 --> 38:24.420
| see you swallowed your pride,
called the prosecutor.

38:24.469 --> 38:25.754
Yeah.

38:25.804 --> 38:28.011
Yeah, but now that we got
another potential shooter,

38:28.056 --> 38:30.263
it changes everything.
I'm gonna be up all night.

38:30.308 --> 38:32.264
I don't even know what
my testimony's gonna be yet.

38:32.310 --> 38:34.266
Jerry, I'm not your wife.

38:35.522 --> 38:36.887
What am | to you?

38:36.940 --> 38:38.726
(lowered voice) Traci,

38:38.775 --> 38:40.686
l-l really can't talk
about this right now.

38:40.735 --> 38:42.521
I need to talk about it.

38:46.115 --> 38:49.573
The ink on my divorce
isn't even dry yet.

38:49.619 --> 38:51.530
Okay, this--this...

38:51.579 --> 38:53.115
this is all new to me.

38:54.499 --> 38:55.830
Okay, well, you know what?

38:57.335 --> 38:58.324
I'm gonna go shoot.

38:58.378 --> 38:59.914
Okay.

39:06.261 --> 39:07.501
We're due at the firing range.

39:08.304 --> 39:10.636
I'll meet you there.

39:10.682 --> 39:12.513
- Look, I'm trying to--
- Skip it.

39:12.559 --> 39:14.720
I'm sorry.

39:14.769 --> 39:16.600
lf--|f we've--lf l've...

39:16.646 --> 39:17.852
- It's fine.
- Judged you--

39:21.526 --> 39:24.438
Okay. Do you feel better now?

39:24.487 --> 39:25.476
Gail--

39:25.530 --> 39:27.486
Dov, go!

39:31.744 --> 39:33.575
(man)
J‘ That is more than I can do .l‘

39:33.621 --> 39:35.532
J‘ In this mess of me and you .l‘

39:35.582 --> 39:36.788
.l‘ I swear .l‘

39:36.833 --> 39:39.745
.l‘ I didn't always mean to be so blue .l‘

39:39.794 --> 39:41.455
.l‘ Troubles can go quickly .l‘

39:41.504 --> 39:45.588
.l‘ When you're only picky when it counts,
you said J‘

39:45.633 --> 39:47.669
.l‘ That I could never turn around .l‘

39:47.719 --> 39:50.461
.l‘ Every thought is a secret .l‘

39:50.513 --> 39:53.971
- .l‘ I can never turn around .l‘
- (whispers) Yes.

39:54.017 --> 39:55.973
.l‘ I don't have to do a thing .l‘

39:56.019 --> 39:57.805
Yes!

40:01.065 --> 40:02.396
(sighs)

40:09.949 --> 40:11.530
Hey.

40:13.286 --> 40:14.617
You waiting for me?

40:15.663 --> 40:17.119
I ran into your friend Swarek.

40:17.165 --> 40:18.496
Yeah, and that's all we are--

40:18.541 --> 40:20.247
just friends.

40:23.046 --> 40:25.162
So are we talking again?

40:26.591 --> 40:28.172
No.

40:28.217 --> 40:29.832
You and l are done talking.

40:29.886 --> 40:31.046
(man) J‘ I realized .l‘

40:31.095 --> 40:33.882
.l‘ That I was only looking out for me .l‘

40:33.932 --> 40:37.390
.l‘ Instead of getting you the help you need .l‘
