00:22.500 --> 00:27.600
[Phil] He's just in town.
He'll be back any time now.

00:27.633 --> 00:29.500
[officer] I'm sorry, sir.

00:29.533 --> 00:33.267
-[Phil] He's his dad.
-[Jack] Why are you taking me?

00:33.300 --> 00:36.167
-I don't understand
what the problem is.
-[officer] Get in the car, son.

00:36.200 --> 00:38.133
-[Jack] I haven't done
anything wrong.
-Jack?

00:38.167 --> 00:41.200
-I just want to see my dad.
-[officer] Mind your head.

00:41.233 --> 00:44.467
-Jack? No. No. No, wait!
-[car engine starts]

00:44.500 --> 00:48.333
Wait! Wait, please! Jack!
That's my son!

00:48.367 --> 00:50.433
Jack! Jack!

01:14.100 --> 01:16.433
I know this is a really
confusing time for you, darling.

01:16.467 --> 01:18.467
I understand
how difficult it's been for you,

01:18.500 --> 01:20.533
but you cannot go running off
like that, sweetheart.

01:20.567 --> 01:22.233
Seriously. You frightened
Rosie half to death.

01:22.267 --> 01:23.700
You frightened me
half to death.

01:23.733 --> 01:25.667
-I'm fine.
-Yeah, of course, you are.

01:25.700 --> 01:27.233
And we know you're not
a child anymore,

01:27.267 --> 01:29.300
but we love you and we worry.

01:29.333 --> 01:32.433
-That's all that Mum's saying.
-Alice.

01:33.667 --> 01:36.467
Jack, listen,

01:36.500 --> 01:39.533
-we've got no idea what the next
few weeks are gonna be like.
-He's my dad.

01:39.567 --> 01:41.667
-I know.
-If I want to see him,
you can't stop me.

01:41.700 --> 01:42.733
Jack.

01:44.833 --> 01:47.233
-Jack!
-[David] You should have
called me, Phil.

01:47.267 --> 01:50.400
I did. Several times.

01:50.433 --> 01:53.200
I let him in, but then, Alice
must have called the police

01:53.233 --> 01:55.467
'cause they turned up
a couple minutes later.

01:55.500 --> 01:59.100
I'm his dad.
What-- What do they think
I'm gonna do to him?

01:59.133 --> 02:01.200
I'm his dad!

02:01.233 --> 02:05.033
[sighs] Did he say anything?

02:05.067 --> 02:08.267
-What did he say?
-Well, not a lot, just...

02:08.300 --> 02:10.200
just that he wanted
to see you.

02:13.600 --> 02:14.700
I missed him.

02:14.733 --> 02:16.767
[beer cap pops]

02:16.800 --> 02:18.000
[bottle opener clangs]

02:20.300 --> 02:25.133
David Collins is a sick man.
I don't know how many
more ways I can say it.

02:25.167 --> 02:27.367
-He was your best friend.
-Right up until he beat
his wife to death

02:27.400 --> 02:30.433
and dumped her body
in a lake.

02:30.467 --> 02:35.733
Look. They may have let him out,
but we all know he did it.

02:35.767 --> 02:38.367
And anything he says now,
any accusations he makes

02:38.400 --> 02:41.333
are just the delusions
of a guilty man.

02:41.367 --> 02:43.067
Trust me.

02:46.600 --> 02:49.233
-What if Wilson calls
the police?
-I didn't touch him.

02:49.267 --> 02:51.567
-But you thought about it.
-He was sleeping with my wife.

02:51.600 --> 02:55.267
-Oh.
-My best friend was sleeping
with my wife.

02:55.300 --> 02:57.633
And then, something happened,
I'm not sure what.

02:57.667 --> 02:59.833
-No. We've been through this.
-But he killed her.
He killed her.

02:59.867 --> 03:03.433
-Dave, we've been through...
-He framed me
to cover his tracks.

03:03.467 --> 03:06.167
-That's what happened!
-You have absolutely
no proof of that.

03:06.200 --> 03:09.167
-Not a single shred of evidence.
-No, you listen to me.

03:09.200 --> 03:11.833
And I didn't spend seven years
campaigning to get you out

03:11.867 --> 03:13.633
so that you can chase shadows.

03:18.167 --> 03:19.267
[Phil sighs]

03:22.167 --> 03:23.800
Think of Jack and Rosie.

03:26.300 --> 03:29.033
Right, they have
to be your priority now.

03:29.067 --> 03:31.167
Let the police deal
with Tom Wilson.

03:36.767 --> 03:39.667
Come with me.

03:39.700 --> 03:41.000
Come on.

04:03.367 --> 04:07.033
Look forwards, mate.
Not back.

04:13.433 --> 04:15.267
[theme music playing]

04:28.833 --> 04:30.800
[Cathy] Cause of death
was a single blow to the head.

04:30.833 --> 04:32.467
The shape of the wound suggests
we're probably talking

04:32.500 --> 04:34.533
about some kind of hammer.

04:34.567 --> 04:38.233
The lake was dragged repeatedly,
but no weapon was ever found.

04:38.267 --> 04:41.233
So, Tara was, uh, placed
in a sleeping bag,

04:41.267 --> 04:44.500
and then wrapped in a tarpaulin,
which was secured at both ends

04:44.533 --> 04:47.700
with a distinctive knot
called a butterfly knot.

04:47.733 --> 04:49.633
This one here.

04:49.667 --> 04:51.300
And she'd probably
still be down there

04:51.333 --> 04:54.067
if the diving club
hadn't found her.

04:54.100 --> 04:57.433
So, this was, um...
this was a meticulous job,

04:57.467 --> 05:00.633
and whoever did it
was cold, calm and collected.

05:06.633 --> 05:08.467
[Rob] Jack wants
to meet David.

05:08.500 --> 05:11.233
And, obviously, we're
very concerned for his welfare.

05:11.267 --> 05:13.600
We're also worried
about the effect on Rosie.

05:13.633 --> 05:17.333
Yeah. So, we need to know
which side the judge
is likely to come down on.

05:17.367 --> 05:20.767
We both feel that it's not
in the kids' best interests
to have any contact with him.

05:20.800 --> 05:22.700
Well, Jack is nearly 16,

05:22.733 --> 05:25.733
so who he chooses to meet
is not a matter for the courts.

05:25.767 --> 05:29.600
And as for Rosie, Mr. Collins
has a right to see her.

05:29.633 --> 05:35.433
I received
an Application for Contact
from his solicitor this morning.

05:35.467 --> 05:37.333
Well, we'll contest it.

05:37.367 --> 05:39.033
Well, you can,

05:39.067 --> 05:42.433
but I would strongly
counsel you against it.

05:42.467 --> 05:44.800
Courts take
a dim view of that,

05:44.833 --> 05:50.200
and, in extreme circumstances,
can reverse custody
in favour of the father

05:50.233 --> 05:53.800
if he demonstrates
a more constructive attitude.

05:53.833 --> 05:57.767
Look, instead of saying
a blanket "no",
we'll say a "not now".

05:57.800 --> 06:00.633
We'll argue
that Rosie's distress is such

06:00.667 --> 06:02.800
that she needs a period
of three months or more,

06:02.833 --> 06:07.233
before any formal contact
is made.

06:07.267 --> 06:09.367
Look, I know this isn't
what you wanted to hear,

06:09.400 --> 06:11.367
but I'm just giving you
the facts.

06:11.400 --> 06:13.567
This process has started now,
and I'm afraid

06:13.600 --> 06:15.700
there's very little
you can do to stop it.

06:20.600 --> 06:22.300
[man] The application only takes
two to three weeks,

06:22.333 --> 06:24.367
but the Moffatts may try
to delay things,

06:24.400 --> 06:27.100
in which case,
you could be looking
at three to six months.

06:27.133 --> 06:30.433
I'm not--
Sorry, I'm not allowed to see
my daughter for six months?

06:30.467 --> 06:32.567
-Worst case scenario.
-Six months?

06:32.600 --> 06:36.533
Be under no illusions.
You're at the start
of a long road.

06:36.567 --> 06:38.200
Even when contact
is granted,

06:38.233 --> 06:41.133
you won't be allowed
unfettered access.

06:41.167 --> 06:44.233
Initial meetings with Rosie
will last no longer
than an hour,

06:44.267 --> 06:46.400
supervised by
a court-appointed volunteer.

06:46.433 --> 06:50.833
So... I have to prove to a bunch
of strangers that I'm a fit dad?

06:50.867 --> 06:53.633
-Basically, yes.
-Could you do that, Mike? Huh?

06:53.667 --> 06:57.033
Could you do that?
Could you audition
to be your kids' dad?

06:57.067 --> 07:00.633
In your position, yes.
I could.

07:00.667 --> 07:02.667
If you can find the patience,
there's nothing to stop you

07:02.700 --> 07:06.367
having a full relationship
with both your children,
in time.

07:08.800 --> 07:13.600
In the meantime,
there's no restrictions at all
on non-physical contact.

07:13.633 --> 07:18.033
Twitter, Skype, Facebook.

07:18.067 --> 07:19.800
If I were you, I'd start there.

07:27.400 --> 07:29.200
[Cathy] In your previous
statement, you said

07:29.233 --> 07:30.833
that you met your sister
at a local brasserie that night.

07:30.867 --> 07:32.633
Yeah, for a drink, yeah.

07:32.667 --> 07:35.467
And that you spent
a pleasant evening together.

07:35.500 --> 07:38.367
-And that you parted
on good terms.
-Yeah.

07:38.400 --> 07:40.700
Okay, it's just that

07:40.733 --> 07:44.500
we now have a witness
who insists that far
from being a friendly drink,

07:44.533 --> 07:47.133
the atmosphere between you
became increasingly hostile

07:47.167 --> 07:51.400
during the evening,
and ended with you
assaulting Tara.

07:51.433 --> 07:55.300
No. No, that's
absolutely not true.

07:55.333 --> 07:58.067
She said you grabbed her
by the throat and pushed her
against a wall.

07:58.100 --> 08:00.767
No. No. No.
I would never do that. No.

08:00.800 --> 08:04.433
Who the hell is this witness
anyway? This is the first
we've ever heard of her.

08:04.467 --> 08:07.167
Yeah, and we are looking
into why this evidence wasn't
presented to you before.

08:07.200 --> 08:08.567
But right now,
we're treating it as credible.

08:08.600 --> 08:10.367
She might think
that's what she saw,

08:10.400 --> 08:12.133
but I'm telling you now
that's not what happened.

08:15.567 --> 08:21.367
Like I've said before,
Tara wanted to talk
about her marriage.

08:21.400 --> 08:24.467
You said in your original
statement that she was thinking
of leaving her husband.

08:24.500 --> 08:28.033
Yeah, she hadn't loved him
for some time.

08:28.067 --> 08:30.767
She felt the marriage
had run its course.

08:30.800 --> 08:35.167
But she was frightened about
leaving because of the effect
it would have on the kids.

08:35.200 --> 08:40.500
She felt very trapped.
And that night, she...

08:40.533 --> 08:43.333
needed someone to talk to,
let off steam with.

08:46.533 --> 08:48.400
She cried.

08:48.433 --> 08:52.367
I cried.
We both had a bit to drink.

08:52.400 --> 08:56.167
Things got quite emotional
because I felt that she actually
had to leave him

08:56.200 --> 09:00.300
because it wasn't fair
to subject the kids
to a toxic marriage.

09:00.333 --> 09:04.067
And then,
at the end of the night,
I gave her a big hug.

09:04.100 --> 09:06.367
Maybe that's what
your witness saw,

09:06.400 --> 09:10.067
but I can categorically tell you
that I did not push
my sister anywhere.

09:10.100 --> 09:12.267
What I can also tell you about,
but you already know,

09:12.300 --> 09:16.200
is that David Collins
beat my sister
throughout their marriage.

09:16.233 --> 09:18.667
He put her in hospital
three months before she died.

09:18.700 --> 09:21.233
He had her blood on his jacket
when he was arrested.

09:21.267 --> 09:23.300
So, please, seriously,
you know,

09:23.333 --> 09:25.333
for all our sakes,
you do your job,

09:25.367 --> 09:29.533
and you prove
that he murdered my sister.

09:29.567 --> 09:30.833
[Alice sighs]

09:30.867 --> 09:34.700
[birds chirping]

09:39.567 --> 09:40.633
Excuse me.

09:45.567 --> 09:47.567
[indistinct chattering]

10:10.167 --> 10:12.000
[cell phone chimes]

10:24.767 --> 10:27.333
[Rob] There's no need to worry.
All that's happened
is that your dad

10:27.367 --> 10:29.400
has made a formal request
to see you.

10:29.433 --> 10:31.400
[Alice] Nothing will happen
straightaway.

10:31.433 --> 10:35.567
Ultimately, it's up to you two
how little or often you see him.

10:35.600 --> 10:39.067
The law is there to protect you.
To protect us.

10:39.100 --> 10:42.633
Your dad's indicated
that he'd like to see you
as soon as possible.

10:42.667 --> 10:46.067
But we feel it's best
if we wait a little while,

10:46.100 --> 10:47.667
till everything settles
down a bit.

10:47.700 --> 10:49.433
We're gonna suggest
that nothing happens

10:49.467 --> 10:50.767
for the next three months
or so.

10:50.800 --> 10:52.700
Let's get to the end of term,

10:52.733 --> 10:56.300
and then we were thinking
that we'd go away somewhere fun.

10:56.333 --> 10:59.200
-Maybe New York?
-What do you think?

11:02.133 --> 11:03.167
Yep.

11:05.767 --> 11:07.633
[indistinct chattering]

11:15.867 --> 11:17.733
[cell phone buzzes]

11:51.467 --> 11:54.667
[Will] I've got
a confession to make.

11:54.700 --> 11:57.367
The estate agent said
there had already been
loads of interest,

11:57.400 --> 12:00.600
and I knew
you were snowed under,

12:00.633 --> 12:04.633
so... I went and saw it
on my own.

12:04.667 --> 12:06.600
I know, I know,
but it's perfect.

12:06.633 --> 12:10.467
There's three big bedrooms.
There's a huge garden.

12:10.500 --> 12:13.133
-Mm-hm.
-Plenty of room
for a trampoline.

12:13.167 --> 12:15.767
And I really think
if we move quickly,
we could snag it.

12:18.167 --> 12:23.167
-So, what do you reckon?
-Yeah, sounds great... just...

12:23.200 --> 12:27.467
-I thought you didn't want
to rush this.
-But I love you.

12:27.500 --> 12:29.333
And I want us to be
a proper family.

13:14.100 --> 13:17.567
[waves crashing]

13:34.433 --> 13:36.467
[indistinct chattering]

13:41.733 --> 13:44.000
[cell phone ringing]

13:45.667 --> 13:47.433
D.I. Hudson.

13:47.467 --> 13:50.100
It's David Collins.
I'd like to meet.

13:55.533 --> 13:57.233
[sighs]

14:19.400 --> 14:22.167
[David]  Tara was seeing
someone else.

14:22.200 --> 14:24.567
A year or so before she died,

14:24.600 --> 14:27.633
she went to a book group
on Thursday nights.

14:27.667 --> 14:30.567
She hardly read at home,
but she never missed a meeting.

14:30.600 --> 14:33.333
And then one day,
she just suddenly stopped going.

14:33.367 --> 14:37.233
She never said why.
And I remember thinking
at the time...

14:37.267 --> 14:39.600
that she seemed really down.

14:39.633 --> 14:44.367
And this was about
four or five months
before she was murdered.

14:44.400 --> 14:46.067
And this was
about the same time

14:46.100 --> 14:50.267
that Tom Wilson stopped
coming to our house.

14:50.300 --> 14:53.367
-So you're saying you think
it was him she was seeing?
-Yeah. Yeah, I am.

14:53.400 --> 14:56.167
And you think he may have
had something to do
with her death.

14:56.200 --> 14:57.467
Yes, because he lied.

14:59.867 --> 15:00.733
Just...

15:03.600 --> 15:08.200
He lied about what time
he left our house.

15:08.233 --> 15:11.333
Did you mention this
to the original investigation?

15:11.367 --> 15:16.033
No, no, because
I hadn't worked it out then.

15:16.067 --> 15:21.333
But I had a lot of thinking time
after I was convicted.

15:21.367 --> 15:24.667
-Did you ever see them together?
-No. No, not like that.

15:24.700 --> 15:27.500
-No. No.
-You didn't find anything
incriminating.

15:27.533 --> 15:32.067
-No, I didn't.
-Like photos, texts or anything?

15:32.100 --> 15:34.100
-I'm sorry.
-No, it's alright.

15:40.733 --> 15:41.800
Tell me
about your marriage.

15:49.533 --> 15:52.567
Well... [clears throat]

15:52.600 --> 15:55.633
To start with,
it was... normal.

15:55.667 --> 16:00.067
-We were happy.
-Why did she want to leave?

16:00.100 --> 16:01.400
[grunts]

16:05.300 --> 16:10.267
I think, in the end,
she found me... limited.

16:10.300 --> 16:14.467
I think she wanted
something more.

16:14.500 --> 16:15.567
Were there rows?

16:18.400 --> 16:22.067
Yeah, course, yeah,
towards the end, yeah, we did.

16:22.100 --> 16:26.200
-Did you ever hit her?
-No. [scoffs]

16:26.233 --> 16:30.333
No, I have never hit a woman
in my life.

16:30.367 --> 16:32.467
Was she gonna take the kids?

16:32.500 --> 16:35.033
Did you discuss that in the days
leading up to her murder?

16:35.067 --> 16:37.500
-I don't remember.
-[pen clicks]

16:37.533 --> 16:39.667
Alice describes your marriage
as toxic.

16:39.700 --> 16:43.400
She said you beat Tara,
you were violent,
you were domineering.

16:43.433 --> 16:46.100
-Yeah, well, she's lying.
-Why would she do that?

16:46.133 --> 16:47.500
Well, you ask her.

16:50.433 --> 16:54.000
If I were you,
I wouldn't believe a single word
that that bitch says.

17:29.367 --> 17:32.267
-[Rob] Alice,
I'm off to the boatyard.
-Okay.

17:35.667 --> 17:37.600
[Rosie] What did Mum say?

17:37.633 --> 17:41.667
[Jack] She's not happy,
but I'm still gonna see him.

17:41.700 --> 17:44.733
Are you nervous?

17:44.767 --> 17:46.233
A bit.

17:48.500 --> 17:51.233
What are you gonna say to him?

17:51.267 --> 17:53.600
Um, I have no idea.

17:56.467 --> 17:59.133
Look, now, it's fine.
I'm gonna be a couple of hours,

17:59.167 --> 18:03.167
and then I'll be back, alright?
I promise.

18:03.200 --> 18:04.433
Let's go.

18:09.233 --> 18:10.667
[woman] Thanks for coming.

18:12.300 --> 18:15.133
I nearly didn't.

18:15.167 --> 18:17.333
But, in the end,
I couldn't resist.

18:17.367 --> 18:19.100
Does Tom know I'm here?

18:19.133 --> 18:21.367
No.

18:21.400 --> 18:25.167
-Good.
-Can I get you anything?

18:25.200 --> 18:27.300
[exhales] Shall we cut
to the chase, Melissa?

18:27.333 --> 18:30.267
I didn't come here
for the coffee.

18:30.300 --> 18:34.133
I wanted to ask you
about Tom and Tara.

18:34.167 --> 18:36.567
David Collins seems convinced
that they were having an affair.

18:36.600 --> 18:39.633
-And what does Tom say?
-He denies it.

18:39.667 --> 18:42.267
-And you have reason
to doubt him?
-No.

18:45.600 --> 18:48.600
I'm pregnant, Louise.

18:48.633 --> 18:51.600
Nearly three months.

18:51.633 --> 18:55.433
So, if there is anything
that you know,
anything you can tell me--

18:55.467 --> 19:02.333
Look, it's your life, Melissa,
but if I were you,
I would get rid of it.

19:02.367 --> 19:04.067
And get out
while you still can.

19:14.133 --> 19:16.700
[Cathy] I want us
to have another look
at Tara Collins' mugging.

19:16.733 --> 19:19.233
She presented at A&E
with a broken cheekbone.

19:19.267 --> 19:22.367
She said she'd been
attacked in the street.
I'm not convinced.

19:22.400 --> 19:25.200
There were only
three other assaults reported
in Exminster that year.

19:25.233 --> 19:28.100
-All of them were
teen-on-teen crimes.
-You think she was lying?

19:28.133 --> 19:30.533
Well, it was three months
before she died.

19:30.567 --> 19:35.067
Maybe she hadn't decided
to leave Collins at that point.
Maybe she was covering for him.

19:35.100 --> 19:38.833
But he was convinced
she was having an affair
with Tom Wilson.

19:38.867 --> 19:40.400
What was your interview
with him like, Steve?

19:40.433 --> 19:42.167
-He seemed pretty kosher to me.
-Mm-hm.

19:42.200 --> 19:44.533
I chatted with his PA,
went over his diaries.

19:44.567 --> 19:48.400
He did have an early surgery
the morning after
Tara Collins disappeared.

19:48.433 --> 19:50.367
And I felt
he was very credible.

19:50.400 --> 19:54.133
-I suspect he did leave
when he said.
-Alright.

19:54.167 --> 19:57.233
Can you check all hotels within
a five-mile radius of Exminster?

19:57.267 --> 19:58.833
We're looking
for credit card payments,

19:58.867 --> 20:01.233
hotel reservations
in Tom Wilson's name.

20:01.267 --> 20:04.200
-Anything to suggest he might
have been having an affair.
-Yep.

20:04.233 --> 20:06.233
In the meantime,
I'm gonna talk to the neighbour

20:06.267 --> 20:08.833
about the scream
she heard that night.

20:08.867 --> 20:10.733
What have we got
on Alice and Tara?

20:10.767 --> 20:13.133
Everyone I've spoken to
says they were close,

20:13.167 --> 20:16.100
but I've checked
their phone records,
and it's a bit odd.

20:16.133 --> 20:18.800
Sometimes they chatted
two, three times a day.

20:18.833 --> 20:21.400
Other times, they would go
weeks, even months

20:21.433 --> 20:25.633
-without communicating at all.
-Get a warrant for the content.

20:25.667 --> 20:28.833
And can we have another look
at their finances,
their lifestyles?

20:28.867 --> 20:31.600
Tara was younger,
but she had the big house,

20:31.633 --> 20:35.233
the kids, the money,
and that caused tension
between her and Alice.

20:35.267 --> 20:37.733
But this mugging,
I think it's key.

20:37.767 --> 20:40.333
Someone attacked Tara Collins
in the months leading up
to her death,

20:40.367 --> 20:42.200
and I want to know
who that was.

20:46.633 --> 20:48.733
[Tom]
I really can't believe this.

20:48.767 --> 20:51.600
[Melissa] Why would she say
something like that?

20:51.633 --> 20:53.267
Why would she say
something so disgusting?

20:53.300 --> 20:56.433
Because she hates me.

20:56.467 --> 21:00.367
Because I left her.
I mean, it's that simple.

21:00.400 --> 21:02.533
To be honest,
I'm more confused

21:02.567 --> 21:04.533
as to why you were
even talking with her
in the first place.

21:04.567 --> 21:06.033
Because you're not
telling me everything.

21:06.067 --> 21:08.400
Because there's
nothing to tell.

21:08.433 --> 21:14.167
Louise is jealous.
And David wants the world
to believe he's an innocent man.

21:14.200 --> 21:17.500
I wasn't having an affair
with Tara Collins.

21:21.700 --> 21:24.600
Don't play their game,
sweetheart.

21:24.633 --> 21:26.767
[Beckton]
Thomas or Tom Wilson.

21:26.800 --> 21:29.200
I'm looking for reservations,
room charges.

21:29.233 --> 21:30.633
[woman]
No, sorry, I can't help you.

21:30.667 --> 21:32.500
Okay, yep, okay, thanks.

21:32.533 --> 21:34.367
-Okay.
-Thanks for checking.

21:35.833 --> 21:38.000
Jesus Christ.
[clears throat]

21:39.733 --> 21:41.600
[imitates head shot]

21:41.633 --> 21:45.100
[woman] My first instinct
was that it was a fox.

21:45.133 --> 21:49.300
It was only later I realised
it must have been a woman's cry.

21:49.333 --> 21:53.067
Right. You didn't mention that
in your original statement.

21:53.100 --> 21:55.400
-That you thought
it might have been a fox.
-No, no.

21:55.433 --> 21:59.067
The officer told me
that wouldn't be helpful.

21:59.100 --> 22:03.067
-I see.
-I didn't want to let him down.

22:03.100 --> 22:06.733
Because he'd been so kind
and so attentive.

22:09.600 --> 22:11.767
Okay.

22:11.800 --> 22:15.067
Can you remember his name?
The officer that you spoke to?

22:15.100 --> 22:17.800
[waves crashing]

22:23.267 --> 22:24.367
Hey.

22:28.600 --> 22:30.467
Sorry, I thought you--
I didn't see you.

22:30.500 --> 22:33.000
I thought you were gonna
come in through there.

22:35.833 --> 22:37.600
I just...

22:44.100 --> 22:47.467
Do you want a... drink
or something to eat?

22:47.500 --> 22:49.133
Yeah, just a Coke.

22:49.167 --> 22:51.200
-Coke. Okay.
-Yeah, please.

22:51.233 --> 22:56.267
I can't stay very long.
Rosie's a bit scared.

22:56.300 --> 22:59.533
-Okay, that's...
-Of this.

22:59.567 --> 23:02.133
I don't blame her.
Or you.

23:02.167 --> 23:06.367
I mean, you hardly know me.

23:06.400 --> 23:10.333
But I want that
to change, Jack.

23:10.367 --> 23:12.367
And I want to tell you
that I loved your mum very much,

23:12.400 --> 23:14.467
and I would never have
hurt her.

23:18.867 --> 23:21.333
And...

23:21.367 --> 23:23.367
I'm not who they say I am.

23:30.833 --> 23:35.433
I know you're worried
about today, sweetheart,
but it won't change anything.

23:35.467 --> 23:37.833
Rob will always be your dad
in every way that matters.

23:37.867 --> 23:41.200
And I'm still your mum.
We love you, darling.

23:43.167 --> 23:48.133
And we'll always, always look
after you, no matter what, okay?

23:56.800 --> 23:59.000
[cell phone rings]

24:01.533 --> 24:03.667
[Mari Luz] Guv, I've been
going through Alice Moffatt's
bank statements.

24:03.700 --> 24:05.600
And I think I might have
found something.

24:12.500 --> 24:15.367
Is school okay?

24:15.400 --> 24:18.167
-It is what it is.
-Yeah.

24:22.767 --> 24:27.067
It seems like you've got
a load of mates. That Jason
seems like a nice one.

24:27.100 --> 24:28.700
-James, yeah.
-James, that's it.

24:28.733 --> 24:31.733
Yes. He's crazy,
but he's nice.

24:31.767 --> 24:35.433
What about girlfriends?
You must have them queuing up.

24:35.467 --> 24:39.533
Nah, not really.
It's not really my scene.

24:39.567 --> 24:41.333
Oh, right, okay, sorry,
I thought--

24:41.367 --> 24:43.200
Oh, not like that.

24:43.233 --> 24:45.633
It's just...

24:45.667 --> 24:48.500
It's just, after Mum died,

24:48.533 --> 24:51.200
everyone knew who we were.

24:51.233 --> 24:54.500
And some people said
really nice things, but...

24:54.533 --> 24:56.100
most people didn't.

24:56.133 --> 24:58.033
And...

24:58.067 --> 25:00.100
And we moved schools
and stuff, but it just...

25:00.133 --> 25:03.333
it was the same everywhere.

25:03.367 --> 25:08.367
In the end, it became easier
to not let anyone get too close.

25:08.400 --> 25:10.233
It's better off that way.

25:17.800 --> 25:20.400
I'm sorry, Jack.

25:26.567 --> 25:29.133
[Cathy] She's not at home,
and she's not answering
her phone.

25:29.167 --> 25:32.200
[Rob] She's shopping
with our daughter.
Probably just out of signal.

25:32.233 --> 25:35.633
-Perhaps you can help me?
-Yeah, if I can.

25:35.667 --> 25:37.300
According to
her bank statements,

25:37.333 --> 25:40.133
Tara lent Alice
nearly 20,000 pounds

25:40.167 --> 25:42.067
over a three-year period,
um...

25:44.300 --> 25:47.667
Six thousand in 2005,
same again in 2006,

25:47.700 --> 25:50.767
and then seven and a half
thousand in 2008.

25:50.800 --> 25:53.567
As far as we can ascertain,
that money was never paid back.

25:53.600 --> 25:56.800
-No, it wasn't.
-Would you mind telling me
what it was for?

25:56.833 --> 26:00.500
-No, not at all. It was for IVF.
-Right.

26:00.533 --> 26:02.500
We had three rounds of IVF
on the NHS,

26:02.533 --> 26:06.367
but, uh, our only option then
was to go private.

26:06.400 --> 26:09.000
And we didn't have the cash,
but Tara was doing well, so...

26:12.067 --> 26:15.567
-Sorry, [stammers]
is that a problem?
-No, no. Um...

26:15.600 --> 26:19.167
It's just probably wires crossed
on our end, but...

26:19.200 --> 26:22.167
I thought the problem
lay with you, not Alice.

26:22.200 --> 26:25.833
-No. No. No, I was fine.
-Right.

26:25.867 --> 26:28.667
Because Alice
specifically told D.C.I. Beech

26:28.700 --> 26:32.233
that she didn't have kids
because you were infertile.

26:35.633 --> 26:38.033
Well, she's probably, uh...
probably just embarrassed,

26:38.067 --> 26:41.067
-trying to protect herself.
-Yeah, I'm sure, yeah.

26:44.533 --> 26:46.267
Uh...

26:46.300 --> 26:48.500
Uh, sorry,
I've got to pick Jack up.

26:48.533 --> 26:51.833
Of course, yeah.
Can you ask Alice to get
in touch when she can?

26:51.867 --> 26:54.167
-Yeah, of course.
-Thanks.

27:00.267 --> 27:01.500
[door shuts]

27:04.233 --> 27:06.200
[grunts]

27:06.233 --> 27:08.467
It must have been ten years
since I was last here.

27:08.500 --> 27:10.033
Yeah, me too.

27:14.767 --> 27:20.233
Alright. I'm gonna race you,
down there to the end
of the pier.

27:20.267 --> 27:22.333
I mean,
it's been a while, but...

27:22.367 --> 27:24.600
If you think
you can handle it.

27:24.633 --> 27:28.067
Okay.

27:28.100 --> 27:30.233
On your marks-- Hey!

27:32.167 --> 27:34.267
I'm gaining on you!

27:46.300 --> 27:49.133
[David] I used to let you win
back then as well.

27:49.167 --> 27:51.267
There you go. Careful.

27:51.300 --> 27:53.033
-Change.
-Alright.

27:55.500 --> 27:59.333
That in there.
That's the best bit.

27:59.367 --> 28:01.500
-Can I have a cone?
-[man] Course, you can.

28:01.533 --> 28:03.333
Jack.

28:11.867 --> 28:15.133
-You okay?
-Yeah, good.

28:15.167 --> 28:16.833
Thanks, Dad.

28:16.867 --> 28:19.800
[David] Night.

28:19.833 --> 28:21.400
-[car door shuts]
-Rob.

28:28.667 --> 28:29.733
Rob.

28:45.433 --> 28:47.400
You should've seen
the look on his face.

28:47.433 --> 28:49.700
[Phil]
What were you expecting?

28:49.733 --> 28:51.467
Jack was standing
right there.

28:51.500 --> 28:55.067
Maybe that was the point.

28:55.100 --> 28:58.733
Rob's been a dad to Jack
for nearly seven years.

28:58.767 --> 29:01.133
He's not gonna want
to give that up easily.

29:01.167 --> 29:04.667
By the looks of things,
he's made a pretty decent
fist of it.

29:04.700 --> 29:08.500
All I'm saying is,
you might want to think about
what you owe Rob and Alice.

29:08.533 --> 29:12.033
-You know, what unites you.
-I don't owe them anything.

29:12.067 --> 29:13.633
They stole my kids
from me, Phil.

29:13.667 --> 29:16.300
No. They did what
they thought was right.

29:16.333 --> 29:20.600
And there's no point
getting angry about things
that you can't change.

29:20.633 --> 29:24.100
That's easy for you to say.
You're not the one
getting stared at.

29:24.133 --> 29:26.233
-And threatened.
-Hey, and I understand that.

29:26.267 --> 29:29.467
Do you? [scoffs]

29:29.500 --> 29:32.367
I'm the one that's got
the life sentence,
Phil, not you.

29:35.100 --> 29:37.333
You might want
to remember that.

29:41.300 --> 29:42.500
[knife slicing]

29:47.433 --> 29:51.700
-[Rosie] Was he like
you remembered?
-Kind of.

29:51.733 --> 29:58.333
I mean, he's older and thinner,
but... still Dad.

29:58.367 --> 30:01.133
I can't remember
anything about him.

30:01.167 --> 30:04.567
I've tried,
but there's nothing there.

30:04.600 --> 30:07.700
Of him or of Mum.

30:12.600 --> 30:15.267
No, it's Wilson.
W-I-L-S-O--

30:15.300 --> 30:18.733
[woman on phone]
No room reservations under
that name during that year.

30:18.767 --> 30:20.500
Okay, thanks anyway.

30:20.533 --> 30:23.067
But we do have
a few credit card charges.

30:23.100 --> 30:26.067
Really?
Well, have you got the dates?

30:26.100 --> 30:29.067
Of course,
let me pull up the file.

30:37.600 --> 30:40.233
You two with me.

30:40.267 --> 30:44.100
Warrant to search
the premises.

30:44.133 --> 30:46.633
-Study upstairs, is it?
-What the hell is this?

30:46.667 --> 30:48.600
I'm after bank statements
and phone records.

30:50.733 --> 30:53.667
[Mari Luz]
Contact between the sisters
was sporadic at best,

30:53.700 --> 30:56.033
but the day
before Tara went missing,

30:56.067 --> 30:58.367
Alice texted asking to meet.

30:58.400 --> 31:00.600
-At the brasserie.
-Mm.

31:00.633 --> 31:04.067
Then later that night,
there was a flurry of texts
between them.

31:04.100 --> 31:07.100
I pulled the content
from the phone company...

31:07.133 --> 31:09.400
and they don't make
for pleasant reading.

31:23.433 --> 31:26.333
-What have you done?
-What you talking about?

31:26.367 --> 31:28.400
All that bullshit
about conducting

31:28.433 --> 31:30.700
the most thorough investigation
of your career,

31:30.733 --> 31:33.433
when, actually,
you just twisted the evidence

31:33.467 --> 31:37.367
to fit your very first theory,
David Collins, guilty.

31:37.400 --> 31:38.833
What are you talking about?

31:38.867 --> 31:40.667
I'm talking about you

31:40.700 --> 31:44.167
failing to mention the fight
between Alice and Tara,

31:44.200 --> 31:47.500
pressuring an elderly witness
into hearing a woman scream,

31:47.533 --> 31:51.333
ignoring text messages
sent by Alice to Tara
the night she was killed.

31:51.367 --> 31:53.700
Read them, Will.

31:53.733 --> 31:56.300
Alice calls her sister
spiteful and heartless.

31:56.333 --> 31:58.167
And accuses her
of ruining her life.

31:58.200 --> 32:01.167
And then hours later,
Tara is dead. Read them!

32:04.767 --> 32:06.000
I don't need to read them.

32:09.733 --> 32:11.100
You're smart, Cathy,

32:11.133 --> 32:12.433
you're way smarter than me,

32:12.467 --> 32:15.367
but you are naive.

32:15.400 --> 32:18.200
Every murder case
I've ever worked on,

32:18.233 --> 32:20.133
and I've worked on a few,

32:20.167 --> 32:24.533
there are...
inconvenient bits of evidence

32:24.567 --> 32:28.333
that, on first glance,
seem to challenge
the real story.

32:28.367 --> 32:30.633
-Inconvenient? Oh, my God.
-Let me finish.

32:30.667 --> 32:35.533
Now, in a decent world,
in a fair world, these would
get presented at court.

32:35.567 --> 32:38.600
They'd be examined,
considered,

32:38.633 --> 32:42.567
and then dismissed
as irrelevant.

32:42.600 --> 32:45.333
But we don't live
in a decent world.

32:45.367 --> 32:47.633
If I'd let these be used,
the defence counsel

32:47.667 --> 32:49.767
would have had a field day
with them.

32:49.800 --> 32:52.200
Manipulating the court,

32:52.233 --> 32:57.633
creating a completely
unreasonable doubt
in the minds of the jury.

32:57.667 --> 33:02.400
And then a guilty
and very dangerous man

33:02.433 --> 33:04.233
would have walked free.

33:07.267 --> 33:08.300
But...

33:11.867 --> 33:15.067
if you genuinely think
that what I did was wrong...

33:17.667 --> 33:22.233
if you think it was
somehow immoral, fine.

33:22.267 --> 33:26.033
Go to Hillman,
make a formal complaint.

33:26.067 --> 33:29.100
And then you'll find out
just how naive you really are.

33:50.433 --> 33:52.767
I haven't been
entirely honest with you.

33:54.433 --> 33:56.167
I've done nothing wrong...

33:58.767 --> 34:02.267
but I was in a relationship
with Tara Collins.

34:04.833 --> 34:07.300
Melissa.

34:07.333 --> 34:10.233
Please, wait.

34:10.267 --> 34:12.167
Just come into the house.
We can talk.

34:12.200 --> 34:14.067
Get off me!

34:17.533 --> 34:20.600
Please don't do this.
Look, think of us.

34:20.633 --> 34:23.833
-Think of our family.
-We don't have a family.

34:23.867 --> 34:26.033
[car engine starts]

34:35.633 --> 34:37.467
[Cathy] Can you read them
to me, Alice?

34:41.233 --> 34:43.033
I don't want to.

34:48.233 --> 34:51.800
Tara accuses you
of being a parasite.

34:51.833 --> 34:54.200
-You call her evil.
-Okay.

34:59.133 --> 35:00.833
We did argue.

35:00.867 --> 35:04.833
-So you lied to us before?
-Yeah.

35:04.867 --> 35:08.300
What was the argument about?

35:08.333 --> 35:11.600
I had asked her to pay
for another round of IVF.

35:14.133 --> 35:16.467
-And she said no.
-[Cathy] Why?

35:22.333 --> 35:27.467
She said that she was tired
of throwing good money
after bad.

35:29.100 --> 35:31.033
Why would she say that?

35:31.067 --> 35:33.433
[Alice] Everyone thought
that Tara was perfect.

35:35.100 --> 35:37.167
But she...

35:37.200 --> 35:41.100
she could be
a complete bitch.

35:41.133 --> 35:44.400
Did you attack her?
Did you grab her by the throat
outside the brasserie?

35:44.433 --> 35:47.333
I regretted it straightaway.

35:47.367 --> 35:50.167
-I tried to apologise.
-Did Rob know
about this argument?

35:50.200 --> 35:52.167
No, absolutely not.

35:55.533 --> 36:00.400
Okay. We'll leave it there
for now.

36:00.433 --> 36:04.400
But we're gonna need to go
through all your movements
that night again.

36:04.433 --> 36:06.533
From the moment
you and your sister parted.

36:06.567 --> 36:10.167
I did not kill my sister.

36:31.067 --> 36:32.767
You okay?

36:35.400 --> 36:37.433
Just taking your advice.

36:45.333 --> 36:47.633
[sighs]

36:58.100 --> 37:00.500
Collins!

37:00.533 --> 37:04.333
Get up!
What have you done to me?

37:04.367 --> 37:07.800
[Tom groans]

37:07.833 --> 37:10.033
[groans]

37:22.233 --> 37:25.467
I loved her, you bastard!
I loved her!

37:25.500 --> 37:28.367
[girl] What you doing?

37:39.767 --> 37:41.767
[Tom panting]

37:44.433 --> 37:46.700
[Beckton] So, we have evidence
that your former husband

37:46.733 --> 37:50.800
was having an affair
with Tara Collins
during 2008 and 2009.

37:52.767 --> 37:55.800
Did you know about this?

37:55.833 --> 37:58.567
Yes.

37:58.600 --> 38:00.667
And was it one of the reasons
your marriage broke up?

38:00.700 --> 38:05.567
[scoffs] It was the reason.

38:05.600 --> 38:09.233
-When did you discover
the affair?
-Um...

38:10.767 --> 38:14.300
A couple of months
after Tara died,

38:14.333 --> 38:15.800
I found some texts.

38:22.300 --> 38:26.433
On the night Tara died,
were you with your husband

38:26.467 --> 38:29.100
between the hours
of 11:00 and 5:00 a.m.?

38:31.867 --> 38:34.033
I don't know.

38:34.067 --> 38:37.800
I, um... I'd had
a hard day with the kids,

38:37.833 --> 38:39.633
and I conked out about 10:00.

38:39.667 --> 38:42.233
I didn't wake up until 7:00,
and he was in bed then.

38:44.867 --> 38:48.200
But I've no idea what time
he got home that night.

39:04.500 --> 39:07.800
It was a brief relationship.
No more than a few months.

39:07.833 --> 39:12.433
-And one I regretted
as soon as it started.
-Why?

39:12.467 --> 39:15.600
Well, because
she obviously wanted
much more from it than I did.

39:15.633 --> 39:20.033
-What did you want?
-For me, it was just
a physical thing.

39:20.067 --> 39:25.367
Which was exciting for a time,
and then... it wasn't.

39:25.400 --> 39:27.833
And Tara?
Do you think she...?

39:27.867 --> 39:29.800
-Do you think she loved you?
-Yeah.

39:29.833 --> 39:31.700
I think maybe she did.

39:31.733 --> 39:35.800
-Did she tell you that?
-Yeah.

39:35.833 --> 39:40.467
-And she thought
you felt the same?
-Well, maybe.

39:40.500 --> 39:44.200
She was used to getting
what she wanted in life.

39:44.233 --> 39:46.733
So, you ending it
would have been...

39:46.767 --> 39:51.767
-difficult for her.
-I suppose.

39:51.800 --> 39:55.333
We have records of her
making a number of calls
to your mobile,

39:55.367 --> 39:57.633
your office and your house,

39:57.667 --> 39:59.600
in the weeks leading
to her death.

39:59.633 --> 40:04.167
-Was this her trying
to get you back?
-Yeah.

40:04.200 --> 40:06.133
And what did you say to her?

40:06.167 --> 40:10.067
Well, I just reiterated
that it was over.

40:10.100 --> 40:12.400
And you only spoke
on the phone?

40:12.433 --> 40:16.300
No, no,
she'd come to the hospital,

40:16.333 --> 40:18.433
wait outside my house.

40:18.467 --> 40:21.233
[Cathy] Did you speak to her
in person on those occasions?

40:21.267 --> 40:23.367
A couple of times, yeah.

40:23.400 --> 40:26.200
I imagine those exchanges
would have been pretty heated.

40:26.233 --> 40:27.600
Well, from her side, yeah.

40:27.633 --> 40:29.067
-Not yours?
-Absolutely not.

40:30.733 --> 40:34.367
All I ever did was...
defend myself.

40:34.400 --> 40:35.433
Physically?

40:37.767 --> 40:42.100
I tried to make her understand
that I would never
leave my wife,

40:42.133 --> 40:44.600
and then, one night,
she just went for me.

40:44.633 --> 40:47.233
Punching and kicking and...

40:47.267 --> 40:52.667
[exhales] I threw out an arm
to fend her off and...

40:52.700 --> 40:55.100
accidentally,
I caught her in the face.

40:55.133 --> 40:56.500
But I never meant to hurt her.

40:56.533 --> 41:00.333
-Where in the face?
-Her cheek.

41:04.433 --> 41:06.700
Your ex-wife has now said
that she was actually asleep

41:06.733 --> 41:09.600
when you got home
on the night of Tara's murder.

41:09.633 --> 41:13.667
I left David's house
at 10:30, no later.
I went straight home.

41:13.700 --> 41:16.333
-You're sure?
-Yes!

41:16.367 --> 41:19.767
[scoffs] This is insane.
I would never have hurt Tara.

41:19.800 --> 41:22.700
-You just admitted you did.
-Accidentally.

41:22.733 --> 41:24.367
Maybe you killed her
accidentally.

41:24.400 --> 41:27.033
-A row just got out of hand?
-No.

41:27.067 --> 41:30.667
I did not kill Tara Collins.

41:30.700 --> 41:33.367
I swear, I did not kill her.

41:36.233 --> 41:38.100
Why the hell
did you lie to the police
in the first place?

41:38.133 --> 41:40.467
Because I was ashamed.

41:40.500 --> 41:43.033
And that's all there was to it?
The argument at the restaurant?

41:43.067 --> 41:45.733
Oh, how could you even
ask me that?

41:49.700 --> 41:51.367
So, what happens now?

41:51.400 --> 41:54.067
-They want to see me again.
-Oh, Jesus.

41:55.867 --> 41:58.667
-What the hell
do they want from you?
-Where's Jack?

41:58.700 --> 42:02.233
Alice, are you
listening to me?

42:02.267 --> 42:04.300
He should have been home
an hour ago.

42:11.433 --> 42:15.600
Oh, great, you want
to add snooping to our list
of our misdemeanours?

42:22.567 --> 42:27.267
I knew it. This is exactly
what I wanted to avoid.

42:27.300 --> 42:29.333
Alice. Alice.
Going there won't help.

42:29.367 --> 42:30.400
[door closing]

42:43.500 --> 42:45.200
Jack!

42:49.367 --> 42:51.633
Alice, this isn't
a good idea.

42:51.667 --> 42:53.700
-[Jack] And James walked
right up to him--
-[David] Straight up?

42:53.733 --> 42:56.733
-Yep.
-I used to have a friend
when I was in school, Gary.

42:56.767 --> 42:59.600
-What he used to do is,
he used to write--
-[Phil] Dave.

43:08.333 --> 43:12.500
Get in the car, Jack. Now.

43:12.533 --> 43:15.233
Yeah, perhaps
you should go, mate.
It's getting late.

43:17.733 --> 43:20.600
Yeah, you should.
We'll do this again, okay?

43:20.633 --> 43:22.333
This is bullshit.

43:30.167 --> 43:32.733
You can't stop him
coming here.

43:32.767 --> 43:34.533
You won't win
this fight, Alice.

43:34.567 --> 43:37.267
I will see you in hell

43:37.300 --> 43:40.567
before you take
my children away from me.

43:47.167 --> 43:50.067
Your children?
Your children?

43:55.833 --> 43:57.500
[machine whirring]

44:01.133 --> 44:02.433
Hey, Dad.

44:02.467 --> 44:03.733
Hey, sweetheart.

44:03.767 --> 44:05.133
What are you doing here?

44:07.200 --> 44:08.467
Are we going to be okay?

44:10.333 --> 44:12.033
Of course, sweetheart.

44:15.667 --> 44:18.033
Look, I know this is all scary.

44:18.067 --> 44:20.400
It's scary for me too, but...

44:20.433 --> 44:22.033
we're gonna be fine.

44:24.167 --> 44:26.600
We love you too much
to let anything bad
happen to you.

44:29.400 --> 44:31.267
Look, pass me that rope.

44:36.133 --> 44:37.767
Alright, give me your hand.

44:39.467 --> 44:41.700
Spread your fingers.

44:41.733 --> 44:43.600
What is it?

44:43.633 --> 44:47.133
This is like our little family.

44:50.133 --> 44:53.333
Pull that. Go on, pull.

44:53.367 --> 44:55.667
-Unbreakable. Go on, pull.
-[Rosie grunts]

44:55.700 --> 44:58.300
-[grunts]
-[chuckles]

44:58.333 --> 45:01.400
Come on.
Let's get home.

45:01.433 --> 45:04.767
-What's for tea?
-I don't know.
I think fish fingers.

45:04.800 --> 45:04.867
-Oh, no.
-[Rosie giggles]
