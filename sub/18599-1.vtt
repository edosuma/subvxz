06:25.945 --> 06:29.500

06:59.079 --> 07:03.088

Okay, what is the new number?

09:49.124 --> 09:52.044
Levi has been absent twelve times this semester.

09:53.845 --> 09:57.249

.

11:02.490 --> 11:03.814
Going to a really good school

11:05.515 --> 11:09.775

11:09.776 --> 11:11.666
- Let him do as he wants.

- I'm ready if you're ready.
- No, Charles.

11:56.256 --> 11:58.526
This is something I need to do alone.

11:58.927 --> 12:00.445
Is it because they are black?

12:00.446 --> 12:03.612
No, my friend, is because you have
13 and are not family.

12:03.813 --> 12:06.978
Okay, I have a photomontage
greeting him with that kind of hand.

12:07.179 --> 12:08.379
It's okay.

12:22.280 --> 12:24.399
Hi, Mom, Dad is at home?

12:24.400 --> 12:28.539

- Yes, but I only do licenses.

16:48.356 --> 16:51.888
I do not want to mess with the school.
I was supposed to graduate this summer.

16:51.889 --> 16:54.655
- But if you have 22

16:54.656 --> 16:57.977
Please Shaddy,

I can not even
I can leave my house.

17:03.334 --> 17:07.534

17:07.535 --> 17:12.398
- Is Samson?
- Shut up mom!

17:12.400 --> 17:15.199
Samson will never come back!

17:16.099 --> 17:17.968
Sorry, Levi,
would be best for you to go...

17:17.969 --> 17:20.022
... The front door
yourself and make your own.

17:20.023 --> 17:21.023
Can not social just...?

17:25.724 --> 17:26.724
Great.

17:35.026 --> 17:38.222
Okay, Charles,
this is a great mission.

17:38.223 --> 17:41.499
- Are you ready to accept?
- I do not think is so great for me.

17:41.500 --> 17:43.666
Can we go over the plan again?

17:45.667 --> 17:48.540
First we crossed the street, we
the concierge and headed to...

17:48.541 --> 17:51.580
... this side of the building, where
is a ladder in case of fire.

17:51.581 --> 17:54.690
We use this to secure and remove the
up with her to...

17:54.691 --> 17:57.899
... the roof, once there, open the vent
CB.

17:57.900 --> 18:00.877
Then you are entering.
I will tie this rope to get off...

18:00.878 --> 18:03.988
... the living directors, to
you can open inside me and...

18:03.989 --> 18:06.111
I can get super fast access
computer and change my rating.

18:07.112 --> 18:10.033
- Why can disguise these raccoon?
- I needed a costume.

18:10.434 --> 18:11.733
Come on, let's do it.

18:15.234 --> 18:17.844
Levi Collins,
What the hell are you doing?

18:19.145 --> 18:20.745
My arm.

18:28.546 --> 18:30.499
Look like a bear or something.

18:30.500 --> 18:34.300
Do you know what it looks like when you
come in a police car dressed like that?

18:34.301 --> 18:36.777
That's the
costume that I made when you were 16?

18:36.778 --> 18:39.279
- If this is it. - Even you have left?
- If I still

18:39.280 --> 18:43.157
- See? Even you have left.
- Barely.

18:43.358 --> 18:45.619
Forget the costume is supposed to be here
...

18:45.620 --> 18:47.966
...
this afternoon to practice with me. Where were you?

18:47.967 --> 18:51.433
Sorry,
had a job interview.

18:51.434 --> 18:52.755
For what? A carnival?

18:52.756 --> 18:55.800
A summer job, that's great affection
. I think...

18:55.801 --> 18:58.999
... that's great.
You can make extra money, new friends...

18:59.000 --> 19:00.999
- Of course I think.
- Mr. Mayor, I need fir-

19:01.000 --> 19:04.278
- What did we say play?
- I'm sorry. I took them 5 minutes.

19:04.279 --> 19:08.888
Thanks Donnie. But I insist is a
fabulous idea. It will make new friends.

19:09.189 --> 19:13.172
Know, honey, I wanted to talk about it
.

19:13.173 --> 19:17.155
Daryl as
strange when you're not around.

19:17.156 --> 19:21.877
Lives glued to her cell,
who would think?

19:21.878 --> 19:23.455
- So...
- I got this.

19:35.056 --> 19:38.099
What pimp costume!
You packed?

19:43.200 --> 19:45.855
We have some bad news. I will not go to Mexico.

19:46.656 --> 19:47.956
What the hell are you talking about?

19:51.857 --> 19:55.133
- Do we have to go to summer school?
- No, Dan, only me.

19:55.434 --> 19:58.888
- This is supposed to fix it.
- The Bob officer intervened.

19:58.889 --> 20:01.555
- I'm too depressed!
- What are you talking ?!

20:01.956 --> 20:03.888
We can not delay a few weeks?

20:03.889 --> 20:05.944
No, I plan everything
months, plus...

20:05.945 --> 20:08.233
... we only have until Monday to escape
.

20:09.634 --> 20:13.253
- Hey, I have no choice.
- Do not you have another option?

20:13.654 --> 20:14.654
Very well.

20:16.355 --> 20:17.355
Good luck.

20:17.356 --> 20:20.000
Wait, what
will go without me like that?

20:20.001 --> 20:21.333
Do we have a choice?

20:24.734 --> 20:26.411
No, I guess not.

20:28.612 --> 20:32.122
- Make me proud.
- Oh, we will.

20:32.123 --> 20:33.444
's Go, let's go.

20:37.845 --> 20:40.844

20:43.545 --> 20:46.708
- I stay with Levi.
- Dude, you can not stay here.

20:46.709 --> 20:49.066
Yes, yes I can. I'll stay with you.

20:49.467 --> 20:52.324
Charles, do not let me
the reason why you have a horrible summer.

20:52.625 --> 20:56.019
I do not want to be alone with these
both. They could kidnap me or something.

20:56.020 --> 20:58.125
What ?!!? Do what you want!

21:12.426 --> 21:15.404
What could be so bad?
They are only 10 days.

21:31.405 --> 21:33.944
The final space and beyond.

21:34.145 --> 21:36.789
Hope to take extensive notes and if you do not know what...

21:36.790 --> 21:39.999
... means extensive word
please look for its meaning.

21:44.000 --> 21:47.123
Mr. Collins, late,
why am I not surprised?

21:47.424 --> 21:48.924
This alone was missing.

21:52.525 --> 21:55.188
Chad Worthington! What are you doing here?

21:55.189 --> 21:57.474
Educational work for Levi! . Ms. B has...

21:57.475 --> 22:00.012

been very kind in giving me a summer job

22:03.913 --> 22:06.867

- Enough!

22:10.500 --> 22:12.323
Chad, takes these papers to the office.

22:13.024 --> 22:16.233
That, Mrs. B, I hope I do not build a rocket
.

22:16.634 --> 22:19.388
That was last year.
This year if you have to graduate.

22:19.389 --> 22:21.755
Yes, it's true!
I feel it in the blood!

22:21.756 --> 22:25.279
Hello Levi, I guess the
hack job did not help, huh?

22:25.580 --> 22:27.366

Hey, could you...?

22:42.479 --> 22:44.888
This interrupting the class Mr. Collins!

22:45.889 --> 22:51.123
I hope this time if put
attention. I'd hate to lose her scholarship.

22:51.124 --> 22:55.555
- I was just being a gentleman.
- Hey, I have a question.

22:56.856 --> 23:01.815
- Yes, Opie?
- This class will be easy? Because...

23:02.016 --> 23:04.299

23:05.000 --> 23:07.889
No, this class
not be easy.

23:09.590 --> 23:13.099
Haran laboratory tests, leaving their...

23:13.100 --> 23:17.777
...

23:17.778 --> 23:22.165
This class will last for 10 days, there is a test every...

23:22.166 --> 23:26.999
... day and allowed
is, again, an absence.

23:28.200 --> 23:31.344
Any other questions? All right.

23:32.145 --> 23:37.304
Clean your tables, this will be your first consideration
.

23:43.405 --> 23:46.977
- Hi, I'm Katie.
- Levi.

23:56.278 --> 23:58.178
It was an easy exam.

23:58.779 --> 24:00.889
How many times have you taken
summer school?

24:00.890 --> 24:01.900
Since this is five.

24:04.301 --> 24:08.138
Oh, God, how I see it, we have two options for sitting
.

24:08.239 --> 24:10.213
May not be smart, but if we sit
...

24:10.214 --> 24:12.406
...
unhappy with being dumb bitches will be entertained.

24:13.507 --> 24:15.388
Or we can sit down with these guys.

24:15.389 --> 24:18.209
Diversity is the key
and there are two empty seats.

24:23.210 --> 24:24.510
What about her?

24:26.311 --> 24:29.700

How did you end up in this class?

24:44.145 --> 24:47.666

24:52.001 --> 24:54.054
Thank you, Chad, but am vegetarian
.

24:54.055 --> 24:56.900
Why not delete  that smile
sinister and leave us alone?

24:57.101 --> 25:02.166
Listen, Levi, I hope you know that both
ask the same scholarship this summer.

25:02.167 --> 25:06.423

- Big surprise, right?

25:06.424 --> 25:08.499

25:27.423 --> 25:30.755

here and now?

25:30.756 --> 25:34.166
I would, but this is not
a tennis court.

25:37.467 --> 25:40.111
I was not talking about tennis!

25:44.012 --> 25:47.535
This is Teda Ball, the joke is
maintain balo on the side...

25:47.536 --> 25:51.505
... Opposite pole. And it must be fought
. Nothing loose strings.

25:52.506 --> 25:54.406

your bodyguard.

32:59.067 --> 33:01.966
So you spend your nights
protecting your sidekick?

33:03.567 --> 33:04.867
Rather it is the other way around, right?

33:06.868 --> 33:09.723
Actually at this time
should be practicing tennis.

33:09.724 --> 33:12.116
Levi, you're a real scammer.

33:12.717 --> 33:14.293
And are even good?

33:14.999 --> 33:16.966
Supposedly a result I got my scholarship.

33:17.367 --> 33:18.367
Supposedly?

33:21.768 --> 33:26.712
I did not graduate, so reconsider
to pass this class.

33:26.713 --> 33:28.423
- That sucks.
- Si.

33:30.224 --> 33:33.544
So when did you decide you wanted to play tennis?

33:39.545 --> 33:43.039
You know what? Never.

- He's dying!

35:12.456 --> 35:13.777
- I'm not dying.
- No dying.

35:13.778 --> 35:16.068
Y

35:16.069 --> 35:18.399
...
show some respect for his dying brother.

35:18.600 --> 35:20.018
That's your fourth glass of wine?

35:20.019 --> 35:21.923
Do not worry about what your mother does!

35:23.524 --> 35:25.888

35:30.689 --> 35:35.355
Do not you think, what?
Do not think that is appropriate ?!

35:35.356 --> 35:37.888

35:37.889 --> 35:40.666
Mom, thanks, but no

36:06.201 --> 36:08.888
No, I will not mourn.

36:10.889 --> 36:14.700
- You have to prepare for it tomorrow.
- It's at 1:00 pm.

36:14.701 --> 36:16.201

- Why have fractured neck?

36:36.034 --> 36:40.277
- I fight with Icarly.

36:58.345 --> 37:01.444
Do not know yet.

37:03.245 --> 37:04.942
Can you stop asking me so many questions
?

37:06.943 --> 37:07.888
I'm sorry.

37:10.189 --> 37:12.666

I have no travel plans yet, so indefinitely.

38:25.424 --> 38:27.039
But you have a place in Rimbeldon.

38:29.640 --> 38:30.724
Want to buy a plane ticket?

38:33.325 --> 38:34.325
Out!

38:35.426 --> 38:37.288
It seems that the board has changed.

38:48.889 --> 38:51.859
Do you still keep wasting time with that actricita
?

38:53.960 --> 38:57.608
I do not feel comfortable answering that.
Should not focus on the tournament?

38:59.109 --> 39:00.346
4-6

39:06.647 --> 39:07.847
Draws.

39:18.848 --> 39:19.848
Outside.

39:20.149 --> 39:21.809
What ?!!?
In no way! That was on the line.

39:21.810 --> 39:22.817
No one foot beyond.

39:25.418 --> 39:26.369
Are you serious?

39:26.370 --> 39:28.799
What I can say?
It was a great party!

39:28.800 --> 39:31.079
My set was not, clearly gave
on the line!

39:32.180 --> 39:35.589

39:58.000 --> 40:01.888

40:11.589 --> 40:12.894
You know
do not have to do this, correct?

40:13.095 --> 40:13.809
If what you say.

40:14.610 --> 40:16.666

40:51.523 --> 40:52.923
Pass me the soap.

40:56.824 --> 40:58.824
I think it's time to stop this habit.

41:01.425 --> 41:03.723
I think this is his fault.

41:05.224 --> 41:08.148
- How long ago did this happen?
- Since the election.

41:10.549 --> 41:13.266
- Want this?
- Thanks.

41:23.267 --> 41:26.088
Really, Mom, you're scaring me.

41:27.189 --> 41:31.709
God, did you notice me? Thanks Em.

41:32.610 --> 41:38.344
Never 're here, you're always in the theater and things
theater and...

41:38.645 --> 41:45.166
Brian for three years has been in the
tennis, why is it so difficult to contact you?

41:45.567 --> 41:49.788
Y Levi, at what point did you become
your dad?

41:50.189 --> 41:53.333
Is just work,
tennis, tennis and work.

41:53.734 --> 41:58.814
All
come and go and nobody notices that I'm here.

42:07.415 --> 42:10.666
- How are you?
- Asleep.

42:10.967 --> 42:15.077
- Dad will be furious when he returns.
- Especially because you lost.

42:15.278 --> 42:18.655
- You did not have classes?
- Classes?

42:21.656 --> 42:23.824
Really?
You should go to google search...

42:23.825 --> 42:26.088
... mimes,
because I swear they do not speak.

42:26.089 --> 42:29.000
- Which class?
- Because it does not surprise me.

42:29.001 --> 42:31.777
- Is not Dad's fault.
- So because you failed science?

42:31.778 --> 42:34.200
- Because I force myself to play Tennis ball.
- Tennis ball?

42:34.235 --> 42:35.700
I did the same.

42:35.701 --> 42:38.999
Yes, but you are already a professional
and that's better than school.

42:39.000 --> 42:40.587
Leaving school to join the professional circuit...

42:40.588 --> 42:41.947
tennis... but
is the decision I have taken,

42:41.948 --> 42:44.999
there are hundreds of people there.
And at least you're in the top 5 you are nothing.

42:45.000 --> 42:47.466
- Been worldwide.
- What do you think it got there?

42:47.467 --> 42:50.444
Every tournament I won
single panzazo makes me pass.

42:54.145 --> 42:56.377
Icarly why you broke?

42:56.578 --> 43:01.259
- Because you're mediocre.
- Not fully.

43:03.660 --> 43:05.666
Surprise

43:09.467 --> 43:13.088
Baby, this is what has been bothering you

43:13.489 --> 43:18.388
- It happened so fast.
- Auch, that was crazy.

43:20.189 --> 43:22.470
Going to tell you to stop the circuit.

43:28.671 --> 43:32.877
Okay, let's assume you stop playing.

43:33.978 --> 43:35.478
How am I going to go to college?

43:40.479 --> 43:42.388
Is just a second option. It is out of state.

43:42.389 --> 43:44.723
But it is a good school.
If you spend that kind...

43:44.724 --> 43:47.200
... ire to a real university. Trust me.

43:50.501 --> 43:52.766

43:52.967 --> 43:56.104
Trust your success. So it got me to pocket
teachers.

43:57.005 --> 44:00.111
- Trust your success relies on your success.
- Trust your success.

44:00.112 --> 44:02.333
Trust your success relies on your success.

44:03.534 --> 44:07.888

45:04.910 --> 45:08.133

45:08.134 --> 45:10.700
Let's face it, not

45:10.701 --> 45:11.888
Enough!

45:11.889 --> 45:13.700

45:13.701 --> 45:16.244
That's not true!
Not true.

45:16.245 --> 45:19.599
That's enough!

01:07:41.889 --> 01:07:43.589
My life is over!

Best return to that cell once.

01:07:46.156 --> 01:07:47.456
What happened last night?

01:07:47.657 --> 01:07:50.300
Shredding with a bat
my car, that's what happened.

01:07:50.301 --> 01:07:52.399
And we found his car in Nelson.

01:07:52.600 --> 01:07:54.733
Oh, God, my, you're here.

01:07:56.134 --> 01:07:58.955
Charles, what happened just a few hours
?!

01:07:58.956 --> 01:08:00.356
I was entertained.

01:08:13.357 --> 01:08:16.666
I worry so much when you did not come home last night
. Bob, why do not you call me?

01:08:16.667 --> 01:08:22.322

trashed my car over and over again.

01:08:25.444 --> 01:08:28.077
I get it, sorry.
You will be fully paid.

01:08:28.178 --> 01:08:30.707
Can you give us a minute?

01:08:30.709 --> 01:08:32.332
I'm sorry, forgive me.

01:08:35.634 --> 01:08:38.125
I can not tell you how upset I was when
no...

01:08:38.126 --> 01:08:40.666
... Came home last night and did not even call
.

01:08:40.667 --> 01:08:43.015
Your father thinks you left early to play tennis
.

01:08:43.015 --> 01:08:47.455
Honey, this is, this is...
What do bandalizando cars ?!

01:08:47.756 --> 01:08:51.854
I received a letter from report...

01:08:52.356 --> 01:08:56.323
... saying that these
failed in science, why I get this now?

01:08:56.624 --> 01:08:59.666
I did not graduate.

01:09:00.067 --> 01:09:02.166
I was at your graduation. I ..

01:09:02.167 --> 01:09:05.325
No, I did not lie Em
just to be there.

01:09:05.626 --> 01:09:09.000
I lied. And I was scared
and tell or tell Dad!

01:09:09.001 --> 01:09:10.948
I have been taking summer classes at their backs.

01:09:11.649 --> 01:09:14.188
So you're taking summer classes and working
full time?

01:09:14.189 --> 01:09:17.129
No, only the class, but
I fail again...

01:09:17.130 --> 01:09:20.011

01:09:25.112 --> 01:09:28.303
It's so funny, because neither
even want to play tennis!

01:09:28.504 --> 01:09:33.473
O my Creator! Your father is always
dale and dale with the same about your great great grandfather...

01:09:33.474 --> 01:09:35.725
Leroy ... but what
does not tell you is that...

01:09:35.725 --> 01:09:38.499
... Leroy descended from a long line
farmers.

01:09:38.500 --> 01:09:41.917
It was their tradition. But when
Leroy was your age, decided that...

01:09:41.917 --> 01:09:45.332
... he did not want to do that and decided to follow their own
holdings.

01:09:45.334 --> 01:09:47.334
And you can make the same choice.

01:09:50.835 --> 01:09:52.755
- Can be a farmer.
- Si.

01:09:52.756 --> 01:09:55.339
- No. What?
- Hello, I'm sorry to interrupt, but...

01:09:55.340 --> 01:09:58.700
I was thinking, how do we save
Levi, Levi how we saved?

01:09:58.701 --> 01:10:01.868
And I realized that there is a school board
ending at 9 at school,

01:10:01.869 --> 01:10:04.744

01:10:04.745 --> 01:10:08.444
- It's your last bet. Anda.
- Now if I'm overwhelmed.

01:10:08.545 --> 01:10:12.148
Have to trust me.
I tell you everything later, I promise.

01:10:12.749 --> 01:10:13.749
Come on.

01:10:25.050 --> 01:10:27.725
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, my god.

01:10:28.026 --> 01:10:31.144
Better parents
Chad are secured.

01:10:32.145 --> 01:10:33.445
I hate that guy.

01:10:35.246 --> 01:10:37.908
If Uninstalling the filter that can even show it.

01:10:40.609 --> 01:10:43.401

01:10:59.324 --> 01:11:01.828

She should be here.
Where is it, where is it?

01:11:31.310 --> 01:11:32.310
I'm sorry.

01:11:33.211 --> 01:11:34.655

01:12:15.534 --> 01:12:20.000
I do not think, Levi. I am not in good terms with my mother
at this time.

01:12:20.601 --> 01:12:24.222
I spoil everything.
I should have listened to you last night.

01:12:25.723 --> 01:12:28.577

01:12:29.478 --> 01:12:30.478

01:13:47.445 --> 01:13:51.708

Do not you understand? If I do not go to this board, not

- Did you know the consequences.
- Mom, please.

01:15:28.001 --> 01:15:32.899
Not only have you failed three times,
also not turn in your final project.

01:15:32.900 --> 01:15:36.344
My project was eighty percent of my grade
! Can you tell Mrs. B?

01:15:40.545 --> 01:15:45.677
I do not finish all the requirements of the
class, but if you complete your final project.

01:15:45.978 --> 01:15:48.933
I know it was not the best student
but if you let me...

01:15:48.934 --> 01:15:51.888
Show presentation...
know that impress.

01:15:51.889 --> 01:15:55.755
This is all very dramatic, but
the answer is still no.

01:16:21.090 --> 01:16:23.288
I have not seen your project,
but can be good.

01:16:24.689 --> 01:16:27.055

01:17:11.387 --> 01:17:14.644
...
alternative and in my experiment, use vegetables.

01:17:15.045 --> 01:17:16.831
Alternative fuels are not just a...

01:17:16.832 --> 01:17:18.944
... way to save money,
also help the environment.

01:17:20.145 --> 01:17:22.088

resolved.
