02:33.291 --> 02:34.624
What is this place?

02:52.291 --> 02:54.333
My life doesn't really make sense.

02:54.458 --> 02:55.541
Hey.

02:55.708 --> 02:58.458
I used to ask myself a lot of questions
about that.

02:58.916 --> 03:02.791
"Scott, you're a divorced ex-con.
How are you an Avenger?

03:02.916 --> 03:04.749
"Why are you time traveling
with Captain America?

03:04.916 --> 03:06.374
"That doesn't make sense."

03:08.249 --> 03:09.833
A lot has changed about my life.

03:09.999 --> 03:12.499
But everywhere I go,
people ask me the same thing.

03:12.708 --> 03:13.874
Can you take a picture with my dog?

03:14.791 --> 03:16.374
"Scott, what about now?

03:16.541 --> 03:17.583
"What's next?

03:17.749 --> 03:19.249
"Where does the ride take you?"

03:20.041 --> 03:22.124
If I knew that, it wouldn't be a ride.

03:22.291 --> 03:23.291
All right.

03:24.708 --> 03:27.833
-It's been a crazy few years. For everyone.
-Hey, hi. How are you?

03:27.999 --> 03:29.457
Everything is ready for you.

03:29.624 --> 03:30.624
You're too much.

03:30.791 --> 03:32.166
No, no, no.

03:32.332 --> 03:33.374
Your money's no good here.

03:33.874 --> 03:35.999
-Are we still talking about that?
-Yes, of course.

03:37.041 --> 03:38.416
Rubin, you are the best.

03:39.291 --> 03:41.207
Thank you, Spider-Man.

03:43.082 --> 03:45.832
So, let's make time for the stuff
that really matters.

03:45.999 --> 03:47.291
Like friends.

03:48.166 --> 03:49.999
Friends you didn't even know you had.

03:52.124 --> 03:54.124
Remember the people who got you here.

03:54.291 --> 03:55.541
You couldn't have done it without them.

03:56.416 --> 03:59.499
Hey, I'm just a guy who got fired
from Baskin-Robbins.

04:00.249 --> 04:02.166
Sometimes you just get lucky.

04:02.291 --> 04:04.291
I'm lucky I met Hope Van Dyne.

04:04.374 --> 04:05.791
I think you know who she is.

04:06.999 --> 04:09.082
She's taken back her dad's company.

04:09.332 --> 04:11.957
Now she's using the Pym Particle
for global change.

04:13.207 --> 04:15.416
A lot of people say they want
to save the world...

04:15.582 --> 04:17.416
but Hope, she saves it every day.

04:17.541 --> 04:18.541
Thank you.

04:20.082 --> 04:21.332
Thank you so much.

04:21.457 --> 04:25.374
Reforestation. Affordable housing.
Food production.

04:25.541 --> 04:27.207
She's not wasting a second.

04:34.124 --> 04:35.416
I still can't believe it.

04:35.916 --> 04:37.874
None of this should have happened.

04:38.041 --> 04:39.041
But it did.

04:40.749 --> 04:42.707
It's a pretty good world.

04:42.874 --> 04:44.582
I'm glad we saved it.

04:46.332 --> 04:47.416
"Do I miss the action?

04:48.416 --> 04:49.749
"Sometimes.

04:50.249 --> 04:52.291
"Will I be there when the Avengers need me?

04:52.416 --> 04:53.416
"Absolutely.

04:53.541 --> 04:55.374
"I'd never turn my back on them.

04:56.041 --> 04:59.374
"But right now, the only job I want
is being a dad.

05:00.624 --> 05:01.874
"I love you, Cassie.

05:03.124 --> 05:04.582
"Thanks for being my hero.

05:06.249 --> 05:08.207
"And I'm sorry I missed some birthdays.

05:09.916 --> 05:12.124
"And for the rest of you kids out there...

05:12.332 --> 05:13.416
"word of advice.

05:14.499 --> 05:15.957
"Look out for the little guy.

05:16.374 --> 05:17.374
"Make mistakes.

05:18.541 --> 05:19.541
"Take chances.

05:20.374 --> 05:22.624
"Because if there's one thing
life's taught me...

05:22.791 --> 05:26.291
"there's always room to grow."

05:32.582 --> 05:34.166
Sorry, that's me.

05:35.916 --> 05:37.332
Why is jail calling?

05:38.874 --> 05:39.832
Lang!

05:40.999 --> 05:42.707
-Lang!
-I'm here.

05:42.916 --> 05:44.374
All right, come on. Let's go.

05:46.374 --> 05:47.457
Come on.

05:51.457 --> 05:53.832
Hey. Is she okay? Have you heard anything?

05:53.999 --> 05:54.999
Not yet. No.

05:56.082 --> 05:57.499
Hi, Hope.
Hey, Dad.

05:57.624 --> 05:59.416
Cassie. What happened?

05:59.582 --> 06:00.582
Sign here.

06:00.749 --> 06:03.541
You know, just jail stuff.

06:04.374 --> 06:05.374
Give it back.

06:06.832 --> 06:07.749
I know it was you.

06:07.957 --> 06:08.957
Are you sure?

06:09.124 --> 06:10.374
I mean, it was kind of hard to see...

06:10.499 --> 06:13.457
through all that tear gas you fired
into the park full of peaceful protestors.

06:13.582 --> 06:14.374
Where is it?

06:14.541 --> 06:16.541
I'm sorry.
This must be really embarrassing for you.

06:20.707 --> 06:21.707
I did find this though.

06:27.041 --> 06:28.541
You shrank a cop car?

06:28.749 --> 06:29.832
What were you thinking?

06:29.999 --> 06:31.707
What was I supposed to do?
Look the other way?

06:31.916 --> 06:33.791
They were clearing out a homeless camp
in the middle of the night.

06:33.999 --> 06:35.707
-No, I'm not saying that...
-And where do they expect them to go?

06:35.874 --> 06:37.791
It's not their fault that they lost
their homes in the Blip.

06:37.957 --> 06:38.791
I know that.

06:38.957 --> 06:41.874
No one can even afford rent right now,
unless you're some trust-fund asshole.

06:42.041 --> 06:43.124
I'm not telling you what to do.

06:43.374 --> 06:44.624
-I'm just saying...
-Telling her what to do.

06:44.791 --> 06:46.082
Telling me exactly what to do.

06:46.291 --> 06:47.749
No, you do what you want.

06:47.916 --> 06:49.499
I'm suggesting another way to do it.

06:49.874 --> 06:50.874
Okay.

06:51.041 --> 06:52.374
You know, I promised your mom...

06:52.541 --> 06:54.999
that you would only use this stuff
when one of us was around.

06:55.166 --> 06:56.166
It's really dangerous tech.

06:56.374 --> 06:57.624
I know it's dangerous.

06:57.790 --> 07:00.082
What if the cops took it from you?
What if you lost it?

07:00.249 --> 07:01.249
I didn't lose the suit.

07:01.457 --> 07:02.249
You have a suit?

07:02.457 --> 07:03.624
Wait, you have a suit?

07:03.749 --> 07:05.124
I know how to
take care of myself, okay?

07:05.374 --> 07:07.165
Trust me. I'm pretty good at it by now.

07:08.040 --> 07:09.040
Ouch.

07:11.582 --> 07:13.040
-I didn't mean it like that. I'm sorry.
-I know.

07:13.207 --> 07:14.499
That's okay. It's all right.

07:14.665 --> 07:15.749
I get it.

07:15.915 --> 07:18.457
I just think you should get
to have a normal life.

07:18.624 --> 07:20.374
Dad, a guy dressed like a bee...

07:20.582 --> 07:22.415
tried to kill me in my room when I was six.

07:23.332 --> 07:25.124
I've never had a normal life.

07:26.415 --> 07:27.874
How about some music?

07:28.374 --> 07:30.499
"And in that moment, all I could think was...

07:30.665 --> 07:33.082
"'How did the Hulk turn me into a baby?

07:33.207 --> 07:35.082
"'Will I be a baby forever?

07:35.207 --> 07:36.457
"'Am I the Hulk's baby?'"

07:36.624 --> 07:38.332
Dad, are you listening to your own book?

07:38.499 --> 07:40.832
-"But I was ready for anything.
-Hmm? No, that's...

07:40.957 --> 07:42.582
-It's just the radio.
-"Steve and I grew close over that."

07:42.749 --> 07:44.207
-Dad, turn it off.
-It's so weird.

07:44.374 --> 07:46.207
Something's wrong with this switch.
It won't turn off.

07:46.374 --> 07:47.415
I said turn it off.

07:47.624 --> 07:48.832
What's that? Turn it up? All right.

07:49.040 --> 07:51.540
"A little after that,
a raccoon from space showed up.

07:51.749 --> 07:53.332
"I don't think he knew my name.

07:53.499 --> 07:55.832
"I was just happy to meet a raccoon
who could talk."

07:59.207 --> 08:00.582
Excuse me.

08:00.707 --> 08:01.790
Thank you.

08:03.624 --> 08:04.707
All right.

08:06.457 --> 08:07.874
Your Nobel Prize is in the mail.

08:08.040 --> 08:10.582
It better be. I just saved eight bucks.

08:11.290 --> 08:12.707
God, I admire you.

08:13.082 --> 08:14.124
Thank you.

08:14.207 --> 08:16.915
I missed this.

08:17.124 --> 08:18.790
No pizza in the Quantum Realm?

08:19.582 --> 08:21.874
No. No anything.

08:22.124 --> 08:24.332
You know, Mom, you can talk about it.

08:24.832 --> 08:25.832
If you want.

08:26.040 --> 08:29.040
Sweetheart, I spent 30 years down there.

08:30.999 --> 08:32.624
I wanna live right now.

08:36.707 --> 08:39.874
So, Cassie, did you make any new friends
in the slammer this time?

08:40.082 --> 08:41.164
Grandpa.

08:41.539 --> 08:42.539
"This time"?

08:43.332 --> 08:44.249
Was there a last time?

08:44.374 --> 08:46.290
I mean, last time barely counts.

08:47.415 --> 08:48.415
I didn't know that.

08:48.540 --> 08:49.457
Why didn't you call me?

08:49.582 --> 08:50.832
'Cause I knew you'd be like this.

08:51.040 --> 08:52.832
I would've just broken you out with ants.

08:53.040 --> 08:54.374
All right, you know what? Family meeting.

08:54.540 --> 08:55.540
Can we have a family meeting?

08:55.707 --> 08:56.749
Isn't that what we're doing?

08:56.915 --> 08:57.874
Yeah, I mean about this.

08:58.040 --> 08:59.915
About everybody being so fine with this.

09:01.665 --> 09:03.915
Look, you wanna help. I get it.

09:04.124 --> 09:05.540
I do, Cassie. I really do.

09:05.707 --> 09:06.999
But I don't want you wasting your life.

09:07.207 --> 09:09.290
At least I'm still trying to
do something with mine.

09:11.624 --> 09:13.499
I literally saved the world.

09:13.624 --> 09:14.499
Oh, did you?

09:14.624 --> 09:16.374
Well, yeah, you never mentioned
that before.

09:16.540 --> 09:18.165
Hey, everybody, Scott saved the world.

09:18.332 --> 09:19.499
How was that for you, Scott?

09:19.665 --> 09:20.915
You should write a book about it.

09:21.124 --> 09:22.540
Ha ha. Hilarious.

09:22.707 --> 09:24.582
Yeah, you're welcome for all not being dust.

09:24.749 --> 09:26.207
And what do you do now?

09:28.082 --> 09:29.332
Sign books?

09:30.624 --> 09:32.332
Aren't you the guy who broke into VistaCorp?

09:32.874 --> 09:34.290
Aren't you the guy who flew all the way
to Germany...

09:34.415 --> 09:36.374
just to fight Captain America at the airport?

09:36.499 --> 09:38.707
Fight with Captain America at the airport.

09:39.457 --> 09:41.499
Wouldn't fight Captain America.

09:41.665 --> 09:42.665
Not insane.

09:43.332 --> 09:44.915
People still need help, Dad.

09:46.124 --> 09:48.749
At least we're trying to do something
that matters.

09:52.249 --> 09:53.290
Who's "we"?

09:55.165 --> 09:56.540
What are you three up to?

09:57.457 --> 09:58.457
Science.

10:00.499 --> 10:01.832
With ants.

10:02.749 --> 10:03.999
Ant science.

10:05.415 --> 10:06.582
I don't believe you.

10:08.499 --> 10:09.790
Let's just show him.

10:14.290 --> 10:15.290
What are they building?

10:15.415 --> 10:16.540
Are you doing this?

10:16.749 --> 10:19.999
Actually, no, they built their own tech.

10:20.207 --> 10:21.582
Pretty smart ants.

10:21.749 --> 10:23.499
Okay, so when you were all...

10:23.665 --> 10:26.665
like, gone those five years,
I had a lot of time.

10:26.832 --> 10:29.207
And I started reading Grandpa Hank's
old journals...

10:29.373 --> 10:31.332
and I got really into the Quantum Realm
and...

10:32.165 --> 10:33.165
The Quantum Realm?

10:33.623 --> 10:36.665
I know we all have a history there,
and I didn't want to freak anyone out...

10:36.832 --> 10:37.748
but we've been talking about it.

10:37.915 --> 10:39.332
She had some questions, okay?

10:39.457 --> 10:42.623
I can't help if people are inspired by me.

10:44.998 --> 10:47.790
So, you've been studying the Quantum Realm?

10:49.582 --> 10:50.707
Why didn't you ask me about it?

10:50.873 --> 10:52.957
I tried, Mom.

10:53.207 --> 10:54.332
A lot.

10:54.457 --> 10:56.123
You never wanted to talk about it.

10:56.332 --> 10:57.540
Cassie's just been curious...

10:57.707 --> 10:59.332
and we gave her some pointers.

10:59.540 --> 11:03.207
This isn't exactly ant science, is it, Henry?

11:04.082 --> 11:06.373
You know how dangerous the Quantum Realm is.

11:06.498 --> 11:07.373
Yeah, we all do, Mom.

11:07.498 --> 11:09.082
Nobody's going to the Quantum Realm.

11:09.290 --> 11:11.082
That's why we made this.

11:11.665 --> 11:14.582
It's like a satellite
for deep space or the ocean.

11:17.415 --> 11:18.707
But Quantum.

11:21.165 --> 11:22.373
We just need a map.

11:22.873 --> 11:25.915
And then we can study and explore
the entire Quantum Realm.

11:27.040 --> 11:28.832
Never even have to go.

11:28.998 --> 11:33.873
Your daughter built a subatomic
Hubble Telescope in a basement.

11:36.873 --> 11:39.373
You know, if I had something like this
when you were gone...

11:42.373 --> 11:43.707
then I could have found you.

11:47.207 --> 11:48.207
It's amazing.

11:49.248 --> 11:50.415
I'm blown away.

11:52.873 --> 11:54.165
How does it work?

11:54.332 --> 11:57.290
It's kinda like that two-way radio
we used to have.

11:57.665 --> 11:59.373
You send a signal down from here...

11:59.498 --> 12:01.457
and then it collects the data,
and it sends it back.

12:01.623 --> 12:02.582
Wait. Wait a minute.

12:03.040 --> 12:06.582
You're sending a signal
down to the Quantum Realm?

12:08.332 --> 12:09.332
Yeah.

12:09.457 --> 12:11.665
-Shut it down now.
-Janet...

12:11.832 --> 12:13.165
-Why would we shut it...
-What's wrong?

12:13.332 --> 12:14.790
You have to turn it off!

12:14.957 --> 12:16.457
Stop and tell us what's wrong!

12:19.915 --> 12:21.123
Janet?

12:25.415 --> 12:26.832
There's something I should have told...

13:01.123 --> 13:01.998
Dad?

13:04.915 --> 13:05.957
No!

13:06.082 --> 13:07.623
-No!
-Mom!

13:08.165 --> 13:09.498
No!

13:10.915 --> 13:11.915
Damn it!

13:14.040 --> 13:14.998
Dad?

13:47.373 --> 13:48.373
Dad!

13:53.915 --> 13:55.040
Dad!

14:20.248 --> 14:21.248
Cassie.

14:26.790 --> 14:27.748
Dad!

14:28.290 --> 14:29.665
Oh, Dad. Come on.

14:31.081 --> 14:31.873
Okay.

14:32.081 --> 14:32.873
Are you okay?

14:33.081 --> 14:34.206
Yeah. I'm okay.

14:49.290 --> 14:51.623
Where are we?

15:09.748 --> 15:10.748
Mom!

15:12.165 --> 15:13.415
Dad!

15:13.540 --> 15:15.290
Hope. Over here.

15:17.956 --> 15:18.956
Are you okay?

15:19.915 --> 15:21.415
We should be dead.

15:22.415 --> 15:23.415
Why aren't we?

15:23.540 --> 15:24.706
I don't know.

15:26.748 --> 15:28.331
Are we where I think we are?

15:28.998 --> 15:30.665
I would say yes...

15:31.956 --> 15:33.123
but it wasn't like this.

15:33.331 --> 15:34.498
Janet!

15:34.956 --> 15:35.956
Mom!

15:37.081 --> 15:38.081
Janet!

15:39.706 --> 15:40.706
Mom!

15:52.831 --> 15:54.956
Do not move.

16:13.581 --> 16:14.998
We need to find Scott and Cassie.

16:16.206 --> 16:17.206
Right now.

16:20.831 --> 16:23.165
Hope? Hope?

16:23.373 --> 16:25.248
Hank? Can you hear me?

16:27.165 --> 16:28.873
-Can anyone hear me?
-Oh, my God.

16:30.415 --> 16:31.415
-It's okay.
-What are we gonna do?

16:31.540 --> 16:33.415
It's okay. It's okay. We're okay.

16:33.540 --> 16:34.581
We're okay. It's gonna be okay.

16:34.748 --> 16:35.831
You're saying "okay" too much.

16:35.998 --> 16:38.206
Okay. All right. Okay.
Well, it's 'cause we are.

16:38.415 --> 16:39.248
We're okay.

16:39.456 --> 16:40.456
We are fine.

16:40.623 --> 16:42.915
Hey, we're gonna find them,
and we're gonna go home.

16:43.998 --> 16:45.165
In the meantime, look around.

16:45.373 --> 16:46.623
It's beautiful.

16:46.748 --> 16:47.998
All right? We're outside.

16:48.790 --> 16:50.873
It's like we're camping. We love camping.

16:51.040 --> 16:52.206
We've never been camping.

16:53.623 --> 16:55.040
But we've always talked about it.

16:59.790 --> 17:01.623
Is that sun moving?

17:12.580 --> 17:13.540
Get back!

17:18.330 --> 17:19.205
Oh, my God.

17:19.290 --> 17:21.748
I don't think this is a sun!

17:22.623 --> 17:23.623
It's fine.

17:23.873 --> 17:25.789
-Dad!
-Honey, it's okay.

17:25.955 --> 17:26.955
Still okay.

17:35.414 --> 17:36.873
Dad. Oh, my God.

17:37.081 --> 17:38.081
That was weird.

17:43.414 --> 17:44.414
Run.

18:12.998 --> 18:16.331
There's Quantum people in the Quantum Realm?

18:16.498 --> 18:17.498
Yeah.

18:18.373 --> 18:19.748
I didn't know that either.

18:23.998 --> 18:25.331
What was that back there, Mom?

18:25.456 --> 18:27.081
What was that ship looking for?

18:27.289 --> 18:28.914
Keep your voice down.

18:29.123 --> 18:31.123
You said there was nothing down here.

18:31.206 --> 18:32.248
Why didn't you tell us about all of this?

18:32.248 --> 18:34.289
Hope, I will explain everything,
but right now...

18:34.331 --> 18:36.123
-I just need you to trust me.
-Then make me trust you!

18:36.331 --> 18:38.956
Let's just calm down, all right?
We can talk about this...

18:39.039 --> 18:41.123
We don't have time to talk, Henry.

18:41.289 --> 18:42.331
No, you need to tell us what's...

18:42.414 --> 18:45.081
Why didn't you listen?
I told you to stay away from here.

18:45.873 --> 18:48.039
Janet, I'm so sorry.

18:48.873 --> 18:51.456
I should have told you what we were doing.
I had no idea...

18:51.581 --> 18:52.581
I know. It's...

18:53.706 --> 18:54.956
We'll talk later.

18:55.123 --> 18:56.914
Right now, we stick together...

18:57.706 --> 18:59.206
we find Scott and Cassie...

18:59.998 --> 19:01.498
and we go home. Okay?

19:01.914 --> 19:02.998
-Okay?
-Okay?

19:03.123 --> 19:04.123
-Okay.
-Okay.

19:04.289 --> 19:05.289
Stay close.

19:12.706 --> 19:14.081
This is incredible.

19:14.789 --> 19:17.081
I've studied the Quantum Realm for years.

19:19.331 --> 19:20.664
Why didn't I see any of this?

19:21.289 --> 19:23.164
You weren't able to look deep enough.

19:23.373 --> 19:25.873
Not through the Void and Subatomica.

19:27.123 --> 19:28.956
There are worlds here...

19:29.039 --> 19:30.789
worlds within worlds.

19:32.081 --> 19:35.498
It's a place outside time and space.

19:37.373 --> 19:39.456
It's a secret universe...

19:39.831 --> 19:41.456
beneath ours.

20:02.706 --> 20:04.498
Hey, get your hands off me!

20:11.498 --> 20:12.498
Cassie?

20:15.206 --> 20:16.248
Where's my daughter?

20:18.289 --> 20:19.414
Where is she?

20:20.498 --> 20:21.498
Cassie?

20:25.456 --> 20:26.456
Where's my daughter?

20:30.123 --> 20:31.123
Cassie!

20:33.748 --> 20:34.748
Dad!

20:35.623 --> 20:36.623
Cassie!

20:37.164 --> 20:38.748
Drink the ooze.

20:39.956 --> 20:41.123
What?

21:03.247 --> 21:04.497
I'll handle this.

21:18.789 --> 21:19.706
Mom.

22:13.622 --> 22:15.789
Was that a good stab?

22:16.372 --> 22:17.706
I got us a ride.

22:36.872 --> 22:38.039
He's friendly.

22:38.539 --> 22:40.039
Quite a ride.

22:40.206 --> 22:43.122
Says the man who invented
flying on the back of an ant.

22:43.247 --> 22:44.206
I like ants.

22:44.331 --> 22:46.664
And I love that you love them. Here.

22:47.456 --> 22:49.747
These will help us blend in.

22:50.456 --> 22:53.372
Where exactly are we going on this?

22:53.539 --> 22:55.331
We're not too far from an old friend of mine.

22:55.456 --> 22:57.372
If anyone's heard
where Scott and Cassie are...

22:58.331 --> 22:59.456
it'll be him.

23:00.331 --> 23:01.331
After you.

23:03.081 --> 23:04.456
Saddle up, Ant-Man.

23:09.914 --> 23:11.914
Let me go! Let me go!

23:23.122 --> 23:24.581
I don't know what you're saying!

23:25.372 --> 23:26.581
I don't know what you...

23:45.414 --> 23:46.497
No! No!

23:56.081 --> 23:57.706
Drink the ooze!

23:57.872 --> 23:59.206
Drink the ooze!

23:59.581 --> 24:01.247
Drink the ooze!

24:01.372 --> 24:02.747
Drink the ooze!

24:04.456 --> 24:05.372
Hello.

24:05.539 --> 24:06.456
Hi. Hi.

24:06.622 --> 24:08.122
Did you drink the ooze?

24:09.706 --> 24:11.081
Why can I understand you?

24:11.372 --> 24:12.372
Great. That's the ooze.

24:12.497 --> 24:14.372
Hey, everybody, it worked! Ooze worked!

24:18.122 --> 24:19.497
We can finally be friends.

24:19.580 --> 24:20.830
Hi. I am Veb.

24:20.955 --> 24:21.955
You just drank me.

24:22.122 --> 24:23.330
I did... What?

24:23.455 --> 24:24.622
Do you need some more ooze? Here.

24:24.789 --> 24:26.705
-I can pour some ooze into your hole...
-No, I'm okay.

24:26.872 --> 24:28.372
-I'm okay. I'm okay.
-Oh, wow!

24:28.539 --> 24:29.997
A big hole.

24:30.205 --> 24:31.789
How many holes do you have?

24:32.497 --> 24:33.789
I'm sorry. Is that a personal question?

24:33.997 --> 24:35.539
I don't have any holes.

24:35.705 --> 24:37.747
His name is Scott Lang.

24:38.872 --> 24:40.247
He has seven holes.

24:45.122 --> 24:46.205
Yeah, that's right.

24:46.330 --> 24:48.122
How did you know that?

24:48.289 --> 24:50.289
He's Quaz. He's a telepath.

24:52.580 --> 24:53.664
You can read minds?

24:53.872 --> 24:56.955
Yeah, and I really wish I couldn't.

24:57.122 --> 25:00.122
Everyone is disgusting.

25:01.955 --> 25:03.914
-Could you please stop thinking that?
-Sorry.

25:04.830 --> 25:06.372
-Please, stop.
-Thinking?

25:07.414 --> 25:08.830
-Thinking that.
-I'm trying.

25:09.747 --> 25:12.205
Well, not very hard.
And I think you look weird too.

25:12.372 --> 25:13.872
I don't think you look weird.
I think you look really cool.

25:14.039 --> 25:15.289
I wish my head glowed.

25:16.372 --> 25:17.372
No, no, you don't.

25:17.497 --> 25:19.955
I know I don't. I'm nervous, okay?
And it just came out.

25:20.122 --> 25:20.997
What are you doing here?

25:21.205 --> 25:23.080
-Are you a spy?
-What? No. No, no.

25:23.289 --> 25:24.247
We should torture him.

25:24.414 --> 25:25.330
Guys. No, it's okay.

25:25.455 --> 25:28.205
We're not spies. He's my dad.

25:30.705 --> 25:31.705
-Thank you.
-Welcome.

25:32.080 --> 25:35.872
Then who is San Francisco?

25:36.039 --> 25:37.539
-It's where we're from.
-It's a place.

25:37.747 --> 25:38.705
Then what's Earth?

25:38.872 --> 25:39.705
It's also where we're from.

25:39.872 --> 25:40.872
We should torture them.

25:41.039 --> 25:43.164
Why are you always trying to torture people?
We have other options.

25:43.330 --> 25:46.122
Do things come out of your holes,
like milk, juice...

25:46.330 --> 25:48.705
Veb, stop asking about his holes.

25:48.872 --> 25:49.914
Some of us have holes.

25:50.122 --> 25:51.539
What are you doing here?

25:51.664 --> 25:53.414
Where are you from?

25:53.955 --> 25:55.372
-Okay.
-Up there. Up there.

25:55.497 --> 25:58.455
-See, above this, it's a different universe.
-The Earth. Big Earth.

25:58.622 --> 26:00.705
-It's the same universe, but it's bigger.
-This is Earth, but it's a very small Earth.

26:00.872 --> 26:02.705
-Sometimes, I guess.
-I get big. I shrink.

26:02.872 --> 26:04.747
-And it's like...
-But I wrote a book about it, actually.

26:04.914 --> 26:05.789
-I don't know.
-This is the Quantum Realm.

26:05.955 --> 26:07.164
You have to shrink to
get in the Quantum Realm.

26:07.330 --> 26:09.122
-We shrunk. Right now, we're really small.
-It's bigger where we're from.

26:09.330 --> 26:11.080
-So, we're small right now.
-It's bigger.

26:14.705 --> 26:16.872
Okay, they're telling the truth.

26:17.039 --> 26:17.914
It doesn't matter.

26:20.830 --> 26:22.580
You come from above.

26:23.830 --> 26:24.830
Like him.

26:26.830 --> 26:28.955
So, he is hunting you.

26:29.830 --> 26:32.289
He will burn the world to find you.

26:33.164 --> 26:34.164
Who?

26:35.664 --> 26:36.747
The Conqueror.

27:39.580 --> 27:43.205
There are beings down here.
Intelligent beings.

27:43.372 --> 27:46.330
I always theorized it was possible,
but to be here...

27:47.455 --> 27:49.580
a subatomic universe.

27:49.788 --> 27:52.247
This changes everything we know about life...

27:52.372 --> 27:54.788
evolution, our place in the galaxy...

27:55.038 --> 27:56.663
Holy shit!

27:57.247 --> 27:58.705
That guy looks like broccoli.

28:08.163 --> 28:09.413
Keep your head down.

29:01.538 --> 29:02.580
Follow me.

29:15.997 --> 29:16.997
Drink those.

29:17.747 --> 29:19.080
I'll be right back.

29:33.580 --> 29:34.663
I'm here for Krylar.

29:39.663 --> 29:40.663
It's you.

29:40.955 --> 29:42.163
Let's keep that between us.

29:43.413 --> 29:44.830
And Krylar.

29:44.955 --> 29:45.955
Hello.

29:47.205 --> 29:48.955
I don't know your ways or customs...

29:49.122 --> 29:52.622
but I assume that you have a beverage
that can get me drunk?

29:52.830 --> 29:53.872
Absolutely, sir.

29:56.830 --> 29:59.288
So, what's your story then?

30:00.663 --> 30:01.663
God.

30:03.288 --> 30:04.288
Move.

30:04.663 --> 30:05.663
It's time.

30:06.205 --> 30:07.205
Follow me.

30:13.955 --> 30:15.163
Right this way.

30:20.788 --> 30:23.205
How exactly do you know this guy?

30:23.372 --> 30:26.538
Old freedom fighter friend of mine.

30:26.663 --> 30:28.705
Sorry, you were a freedom fighter?

30:28.830 --> 30:29.872
Or terrorist.

30:30.038 --> 30:32.080
Depends on who you ask.

30:32.288 --> 30:35.663
But, trust me, he can help.

31:17.371 --> 31:20.038
Janet Van Dyne?

31:21.746 --> 31:23.538
I thought you were dead.

31:24.121 --> 31:26.038
Been a long time, Krylar.

31:26.163 --> 31:29.455
Officially, Lord Krylar now.

31:29.621 --> 31:31.996
I fought like hell against that.

31:32.455 --> 31:34.121
It sounds so elitist.

31:35.163 --> 31:38.080
You have got to be Hank.

31:38.496 --> 31:41.996
I've heard so much about you and your ants.

31:42.163 --> 31:44.288
What are ants anyway?

31:44.455 --> 31:45.788
Do we have 'em down here?

31:45.996 --> 31:47.663
I don't think so. No.

31:48.705 --> 31:49.788
That's too bad.

31:51.038 --> 31:52.038
Hope.

31:52.788 --> 31:54.455
You have to be Hope.

31:54.996 --> 31:57.205
She talked about you every day.

31:57.371 --> 31:58.746
That's strange...

31:59.288 --> 32:01.121
she never said anything about you.

32:03.580 --> 32:05.663
I don't think I would have told
my kid either.

32:06.663 --> 32:08.205
-Wild stuff.
-Funny.

32:09.121 --> 32:09.830
How wild?

32:11.246 --> 32:13.455
Very wild, Henry. Yeah.

32:15.121 --> 32:18.121
Krylar, we need your help.

32:18.455 --> 32:22.205
Janet, after all we've been through,
together...

32:22.496 --> 32:23.455
just ask me.

32:23.663 --> 32:25.163
Tell me, how can I help?

32:25.288 --> 32:26.580
But...

32:26.788 --> 32:29.830
is anyone starving? I'm starving.

32:30.080 --> 32:31.205
Boys...

32:31.871 --> 32:32.871
Now.

32:40.871 --> 32:42.246
They don't know anything.

32:42.746 --> 32:45.538
About... anything.

32:45.705 --> 32:46.705
Then get them out of here.

32:48.663 --> 32:49.705
Excuse me.

32:49.871 --> 32:52.038
Look, he's right.
I don't know what's going on.

32:52.205 --> 32:53.496
We're just trying to find our family.

32:53.663 --> 32:54.788
Do you have a map?

32:55.038 --> 32:56.246
All we wanna do is go...

32:59.246 --> 33:00.288
Wait, wait. Don't shoot.

33:00.455 --> 33:01.580
They're with us.

33:03.496 --> 33:04.830
Is that building alive?

33:05.413 --> 33:06.621
Yours are dead?

33:10.121 --> 33:11.163
Look. Excuse me.

33:11.288 --> 33:12.830
We just wanna go home.

33:16.996 --> 33:19.121
At least you still have a home.

33:26.788 --> 33:28.371
What happened here?

33:28.913 --> 33:31.663
The Conqueror burned our homes.

33:32.371 --> 33:34.080
Our stories.

33:35.038 --> 33:38.288
He built his citadel
on the bones of our people.

33:39.371 --> 33:40.996
Some of us escaped...

33:41.288 --> 33:42.913
found others on the run.

33:43.913 --> 33:45.496
We gathered who we could to fight.

33:46.288 --> 33:47.746
It was never enough.

33:49.121 --> 33:50.288
I'm sorry.

33:51.205 --> 33:52.163
We can help.

33:57.996 --> 34:00.205
-Cassie...
-Dad, you're an Avenger.

34:00.330 --> 34:01.288
They need help.

34:01.413 --> 34:03.330
No. What I need to do is get you home.

34:03.830 --> 34:04.996
Why don't you wanna help?

34:05.205 --> 34:06.330
We don't know anything about this place.

34:06.496 --> 34:08.288
I mean, I don't even know
how time works down here.

34:08.413 --> 34:09.538
Have we been gone for 10 seconds?

34:09.705 --> 34:10.705
Or have we been gone for 10 years?

34:10.871 --> 34:11.996
Think about your mom right now.

34:12.246 --> 34:14.371
-Can you imagine what she must be...
-Don't use Mom as an excuse.

34:14.538 --> 34:16.621
-You just don't care.
-No, I do care.

34:16.746 --> 34:18.455
I know you wanna help. I do.

34:18.621 --> 34:20.413
But this is not our fight.

34:20.788 --> 34:23.413
Just 'cause it's not happening to you
doesn't mean it's not happening.

34:24.955 --> 34:25.955
Hey.

34:28.913 --> 34:30.288
Would you look at me?

34:32.538 --> 34:34.163
She's disappointed in you.

34:34.330 --> 34:35.705
I got that. Yeah. Thank you.

34:35.871 --> 34:36.705
You're welcome.

34:36.871 --> 34:37.955
We'll talk about it later.

34:38.205 --> 34:39.788
Right now, let's just find the others.

34:40.371 --> 34:42.246
No one knows this place
better than Janet.

34:44.621 --> 34:45.538
What did you say?

34:45.996 --> 34:47.121
What?

34:47.288 --> 34:48.454
That name.

34:49.621 --> 34:51.163
Janet Van Dyne.

34:51.329 --> 34:52.288
Where is she?

34:52.413 --> 34:54.246
That's what we're trying to find out.
You know her?

34:54.663 --> 34:55.913
I know her.

34:57.288 --> 34:58.454
She shouldn't be here.

35:00.454 --> 35:02.288
Hey, bring a round of the chasers, please.

35:02.871 --> 35:03.913
Yes, thank you.

35:04.121 --> 35:07.204
If you haven't had this, don't try it...

35:07.704 --> 35:09.788
unless you want to change your life.

35:21.121 --> 35:24.579
Krylar, we're looking for friends of ours.

35:25.579 --> 35:26.829
Two of them.

35:26.996 --> 35:28.371
Human, like us.

35:28.496 --> 35:30.079
Human, that's the word.

35:30.329 --> 35:33.413
Totally forgot what you call yourselves
up there.

35:33.538 --> 35:34.538
Human.

35:35.204 --> 35:37.204
Are you not human?

35:37.371 --> 35:39.371
Not technically, but yes.

35:39.996 --> 35:41.371
In the ways that matter.

35:45.996 --> 35:46.996
No!

35:50.538 --> 35:51.829
Let us talk.

35:54.788 --> 35:59.079
So, what is it that brings you to us, Janet?

36:00.538 --> 36:02.954
If I remember correctly, you left.

36:03.413 --> 36:06.413
You left all of us.

36:07.079 --> 36:08.329
With him.

36:09.788 --> 36:11.746
Janet, what is he talking about?

36:13.704 --> 36:16.579
You didn't tell them about him.

36:19.538 --> 36:21.079
Did you say anything...

36:21.996 --> 36:23.246
about what you did here?

36:25.579 --> 36:27.746
How many people died because of you?

36:32.746 --> 36:35.163
Does your family even know who you are?

36:38.788 --> 36:39.996
Your mommy...

36:41.496 --> 36:43.371
is full of secrets.

36:43.496 --> 36:44.579
You're lying.

36:44.746 --> 36:45.871
I lie.

36:46.871 --> 36:48.163
A lot.

36:50.871 --> 36:52.579
Not about this.

36:54.413 --> 36:55.663
Let them go.

36:57.454 --> 36:59.454
He just wants me.

36:59.621 --> 37:01.038
But you want them.

37:02.454 --> 37:03.954
So they're coming too.

37:05.288 --> 37:08.329
Along with those other friends of yours.

37:09.788 --> 37:11.538
I heard about them.

37:11.704 --> 37:13.913
But he did too.

37:15.704 --> 37:17.329
And he sent the Hunter.

37:17.871 --> 37:19.454
What kind of hunter?

37:20.746 --> 37:22.913
Not a man. Not a machine.

37:23.079 --> 37:26.913
A mechanized organism designed only...

37:27.121 --> 37:28.788
for killing.

37:30.913 --> 37:32.204
Where are they?

37:32.454 --> 37:33.704
No clue.

37:34.913 --> 37:35.913
Dead.

37:38.288 --> 37:39.496
Probably dead.

37:52.538 --> 37:55.996
This is so sad when all of this...

37:55.996 --> 37:57.746
could have been avoided, Janet.

37:58.954 --> 38:00.746
Just give him what he wants.

38:03.996 --> 38:05.496
What happened to you?

38:08.204 --> 38:11.288
We fought against him.

38:13.329 --> 38:15.287
He can be very persuasive.

38:17.496 --> 38:18.787
Let's pay him a visit.

38:22.871 --> 38:24.329
I think we're done here.

38:42.079 --> 38:43.329
Can that ship get us out of here?

38:46.121 --> 38:46.829
Cover me?

38:47.037 --> 38:48.121
Always.

39:19.579 --> 39:21.079
Henry, take the helm.

39:22.079 --> 39:23.204
I'm gonna hot-wire this thing.

39:27.329 --> 39:29.037
Where are the controls?

39:29.454 --> 39:30.787
Those are the controls.

39:34.412 --> 39:35.579
What the hell?

39:35.746 --> 39:37.621
You'll be great. It's like flying a bike.

39:39.996 --> 39:41.996
Is the bike alive?

39:55.496 --> 39:57.246
Hands, all the way in!

39:58.246 --> 39:59.329
Like stuffing a turkey.

40:07.329 --> 40:09.454
-Really, him?
-He used to be charming.

40:09.621 --> 40:10.371
That guy?

40:10.537 --> 40:12.329
I was down here for 30 years, Henry.

40:12.537 --> 40:14.246
-I had needs.
-Oh, my God.

40:14.371 --> 40:16.204
Look, I get it. I've got needs too.

40:16.329 --> 40:17.329
Oh, my God!

40:17.496 --> 40:19.579
I had dinner with someone a few times.

40:20.246 --> 40:21.621
Her name was Linda.

40:22.579 --> 40:23.579
It didn't work out.

40:23.746 --> 40:25.079
What went wrong?

40:25.454 --> 40:27.121
She wasn't you, baby.

40:30.454 --> 40:33.371
-Get everyone in the ships. We're leaving.
-All right.

40:33.537 --> 40:35.287
-And, Xolum.
-Right here.

40:35.496 --> 40:37.704
Take them as far away from here as you can.

40:37.871 --> 40:38.912
-Why?
-What?

40:39.079 --> 40:42.246
If you're looking for Janet,
he's looking for you.

40:50.704 --> 40:52.496
You led them straight to us.

40:53.287 --> 40:54.371
Come on, come on.

40:55.121 --> 40:56.454
Take as many as you can.

40:56.621 --> 40:57.787
We'll hold them off.

41:20.996 --> 41:21.996
Go!

41:23.662 --> 41:25.079
Come on! Hurry, hurry!

41:25.746 --> 41:27.204
We gotta go! We gotta go!

41:27.329 --> 41:28.371
Get on. Get on now!

41:28.579 --> 41:29.871
We have to go now. Now!

41:47.829 --> 41:48.829
Oh, my God!

42:06.579 --> 42:07.870
Cassie, let's go!

42:15.162 --> 42:16.412
Get to the sanctuary.

42:17.204 --> 42:18.287
Wait for my message.

42:18.412 --> 42:20.704
-Veb, we're leaving.
-No. No, wait!

42:20.870 --> 42:22.912
-Move! Move!
-All my friends.

42:45.204 --> 42:46.287
Give up the travelers.

42:46.412 --> 42:47.704
The Conqueror will show you mercy.

42:47.912 --> 42:49.329
I know his mercy.

43:02.912 --> 43:03.995
Stay here. I'm...

43:05.287 --> 43:06.287
Cassie?

43:07.995 --> 43:08.995
Oh, no.

43:32.079 --> 43:33.579
Okay. I have a suit.

43:34.120 --> 43:35.537
Yeah, I noticed.

43:36.287 --> 43:37.579
-You okay?
-Yes.

43:39.329 --> 43:40.579
Look, momentum, right?

43:40.745 --> 43:42.662
Jump, tap, right?
One move. Jump, tap.

43:42.829 --> 43:43.912
I know how to do it, Dad.

43:44.120 --> 43:45.079
-Do you? Really?
-Yes.

43:45.329 --> 43:46.495
'Cause it didn't look like it from my end.

43:46.620 --> 43:47.870
I messed up on the timing.

43:48.037 --> 43:48.870
Jump...

43:54.537 --> 43:55.412
Like that.

43:55.579 --> 43:56.995
You see what I did? You see what I did?

43:57.537 --> 43:59.204
No. You're like this small.

43:59.537 --> 44:00.537
I jumped and tapped.

44:11.329 --> 44:12.745
Jentorra, we have to go.

44:33.954 --> 44:35.120
Get to the ship!

45:23.037 --> 45:25.745
Welcome back to the Quantum Realm, Scott.

45:26.578 --> 45:29.078
I've been waiting a long time for this.

45:29.828 --> 45:30.912
What?

45:32.453 --> 45:33.620
Is someone in there?

45:33.787 --> 45:35.745
Oh, yes.

45:35.912 --> 45:38.495
The destiny you cannot escape.

45:38.620 --> 45:41.787
Our fates have always been forged together...

45:44.120 --> 45:45.953
ever since that day we met.

45:48.453 --> 45:49.787
Scott Lang.

45:49.953 --> 45:51.037
Get away from us!

45:51.203 --> 45:52.787
The day you broke me.

45:55.953 --> 45:57.828
-Banished me down here.
-Wait.

46:00.162 --> 46:01.162
Darren?

46:02.620 --> 46:04.120
Surprised to see me?

46:06.078 --> 46:07.120
Yeah.

46:07.245 --> 46:08.370
It's the bee guy?

46:08.870 --> 46:10.578
-It's the bee guy?
-Cassie?

46:10.787 --> 46:12.412
I almost didn't recognize you.

46:13.370 --> 46:14.995
How are you not dead?

46:15.203 --> 46:17.120
I became the ultimate weapon.

46:18.328 --> 46:20.412
That's what this is?

46:21.328 --> 46:22.578
Look, Darren.

46:26.745 --> 46:27.995
Darren is dead!

46:29.120 --> 46:31.662
There is only M.O.D.O.K.!

46:32.828 --> 46:34.828
And there's no place you can run, Scott.

46:34.995 --> 46:36.162
Not from me.

46:36.703 --> 46:38.370
And not from him.

46:39.412 --> 46:41.537
He's the future.

46:42.328 --> 46:43.453
He's the past.

46:44.245 --> 46:47.495
And now all he needs is you.

46:53.787 --> 46:54.912
Mom?

46:55.328 --> 46:57.120
What's after Scott and Cassie?

46:58.953 --> 47:00.370
We have to find them.

47:01.453 --> 47:03.287
There's something I have to do first.

47:03.412 --> 47:04.787
They could be dead!

47:04.953 --> 47:06.453
Hope, please.

47:06.620 --> 47:08.287
And you're still hiding things from us.

47:08.412 --> 47:10.703
I am trying to protect you.

47:11.328 --> 47:12.328
From what?

47:14.912 --> 47:16.787
Who are you so afraid of?

47:29.370 --> 47:30.662
Third time in jail?

47:32.787 --> 47:33.828
Four.

47:42.662 --> 47:44.703
And here we are again.

47:45.745 --> 47:47.328
Face to face.

47:49.912 --> 47:51.370
That's a face.

47:52.703 --> 47:53.912
It's a big face.

47:54.120 --> 47:55.662
Why are you just a floating head?

47:55.828 --> 47:57.912
Maybe you could walk us through this, Darren.

47:58.078 --> 48:00.995
You left Darren to die in the Quantum Realm.

48:02.495 --> 48:04.662
But the Conqueror found me.

48:04.828 --> 48:06.370
Rebuilt me.

48:06.537 --> 48:08.537
Made me the ultimate weapon.

48:09.245 --> 48:12.037
A mechanized organism designed
only for...

48:12.245 --> 48:13.245
M.O.D.O.K.?

48:15.328 --> 48:17.578
I get it. It's an acronym.

48:17.745 --> 48:18.912
It's an acronym.

48:19.120 --> 48:22.078
Mechanized organism
designed only for killing.

48:23.537 --> 48:25.203
Actually, that's M.O.D.O.F.K.

48:25.370 --> 48:28.787
-I bet you thought you'd seen the last of me.
-Just now noticing the baby legs.

48:29.537 --> 48:30.537
They're not baby legs.

48:30.703 --> 48:32.078
A little bit like a Björn.

48:32.245 --> 48:33.537
You think you're so smart.

48:33.912 --> 48:36.870
Scott Lang,
the man who took everything from me.

48:37.036 --> 48:38.411
Who stole my whole life.

48:38.703 --> 48:39.703
But I did it.

48:41.245 --> 48:42.828
I got you here.

48:43.036 --> 48:44.995
I found your signal, Cassie.

48:45.245 --> 48:47.745
Thanks for that, by the way.
Couldn't have done it without you.

48:50.995 --> 48:52.995
You're looking at a man set free.

48:53.995 --> 48:57.703
I've created so much more here
than you could possibly imagine.

48:58.870 --> 49:01.453
All for him.

49:04.286 --> 49:07.411
I wasn't the only one stranded
in the Quantum Realm.

49:10.703 --> 49:12.495
What is this place?

49:13.745 --> 49:15.620
He said he was a traveler.

49:15.870 --> 49:18.828
A scientist who crashed off course.

49:26.495 --> 49:27.995
He had a ship...

49:28.828 --> 49:31.495
beyond anything I had ever seen.

49:32.120 --> 49:35.286
A ship that could travel the Multiverse.

49:35.453 --> 49:36.620
The Multiverse?

49:37.620 --> 49:40.120
As in alternate dimensions?

49:40.370 --> 49:42.120
Parallel realities?

49:42.328 --> 49:43.953
I didn't believe it at first.

49:46.120 --> 49:47.120
But it's real.

49:48.995 --> 49:50.411
Just like we theorized.

49:52.745 --> 49:54.411
Can this take us home?

49:56.495 --> 49:57.786
It can take you anywhere.

50:16.995 --> 50:18.870
I'd never met anyone like him.

50:21.286 --> 50:23.370
He felt so...

50:23.745 --> 50:24.828
lost.

50:26.536 --> 50:27.745
I guess we both were.

50:28.661 --> 50:30.161
But we had a way out.

50:32.370 --> 50:34.536
We tried everything...

50:34.703 --> 50:37.453
to recharge his ship's energy core.

50:43.078 --> 50:44.620
Nothing worked.

50:46.245 --> 50:50.828
But after so many years alone,
it was nice to have a friend.

50:52.161 --> 50:53.578
I lied to Hope.

50:58.120 --> 50:59.786
I told her I was coming home.

51:03.911 --> 51:05.786
I can see her by the door.

51:08.286 --> 51:09.661
Waiting for me.

51:13.745 --> 51:15.328
That's the last thing I did...

51:17.911 --> 51:19.078
was lie to her.

51:22.911 --> 51:24.953
I just thought I'd have more time.

51:29.828 --> 51:31.245
I can give that to you.

51:33.286 --> 51:34.286
Time.

51:38.203 --> 51:39.495
It's not what you think it is.

51:43.745 --> 51:45.203
It's a cage.

51:46.620 --> 51:48.411
And it does everything it can...

51:48.995 --> 51:50.078
to break you.

51:53.370 --> 51:56.578
It's not until you free yourself from it
that you see...

51:57.745 --> 51:59.245
just how small...

52:00.245 --> 52:01.453
it always was.

52:07.244 --> 52:09.036
We're going to get out of here.

52:12.328 --> 52:13.828
She's gonna open the door...

52:15.411 --> 52:16.869
and you'll be there.

52:21.453 --> 52:22.619
I promise.

52:27.286 --> 52:29.078
-Let's get to work.
-Okay.

52:32.244 --> 52:35.119
It took ages, but we did it.

52:36.744 --> 52:39.078
We brought it back to life.

52:41.244 --> 52:42.744
Let's go home.

52:47.328 --> 52:49.161
His ship was neurokinetic.

52:50.369 --> 52:51.744
Connected to his thoughts.

52:55.661 --> 52:56.744
When I touched it...

52:58.828 --> 53:00.619
I saw his mind.

53:01.744 --> 53:02.744
I felt...

53:04.536 --> 53:05.911
what he had done.

53:09.661 --> 53:11.494
Entire worlds...

53:12.203 --> 53:14.411
entire timelines.

53:14.536 --> 53:18.619
Gone, like they never even existed.

53:36.869 --> 53:37.869
Janet?

53:42.619 --> 53:43.828
We can leave.

53:46.078 --> 53:47.036
Right now.

53:52.036 --> 53:53.703
Who is Kang?

53:59.078 --> 54:00.453
Who I need to be.

54:04.786 --> 54:06.203
He didn't crash here.

54:06.661 --> 54:08.411
He was exiled here.

54:09.453 --> 54:12.619
Outside space and time.

54:13.786 --> 54:15.453
The only place...

54:16.411 --> 54:17.953
that could hold him.

54:19.078 --> 54:20.494
Exiled?

54:21.161 --> 54:22.619
By who?

54:22.994 --> 54:23.994
I don't know.

54:26.453 --> 54:28.286
But they sabotaged his ship.

54:29.536 --> 54:31.369
And trapped him here.

54:33.744 --> 54:35.203
And because of me...

54:36.578 --> 54:37.911
he was getting out.

54:38.078 --> 54:38.911
Janet?

54:41.994 --> 54:43.328
Stay away.

54:48.953 --> 54:50.578
You saved my life.

54:55.953 --> 54:57.328
I made a promise.

55:04.286 --> 55:05.828
Just let me take you home.

55:07.661 --> 55:08.703
And then?

55:10.869 --> 55:12.619
What are you going to do?

55:23.911 --> 55:25.286
Win.

55:43.411 --> 55:46.994
I told you time isn't what you think.

55:49.119 --> 55:50.744
I can make it...

55:51.577 --> 55:53.661
so you never left her.

55:54.952 --> 55:58.202
Hope is going to open the door...

55:59.619 --> 56:00.952
and you'll be there.

56:01.952 --> 56:04.327
And how many worlds will die...

56:05.786 --> 56:07.411
if you get out?

56:08.702 --> 56:09.994
Not yours.

56:11.702 --> 56:13.411
She'll never know.

56:18.077 --> 56:20.661
Don't you want to see your daughter again?

56:22.952 --> 56:24.536
I can't let you leave.

56:26.994 --> 56:28.994
Why do you think you can stop me?

56:46.952 --> 56:48.369
Give it to me, Janet.

56:49.827 --> 56:50.952
Give it to me!

56:51.411 --> 56:54.369
I couldn't beat him.
He was too powerful.

56:55.244 --> 56:56.286
What did you do?

57:00.702 --> 57:02.286
I'm sorry, Hope.

57:04.619 --> 57:05.744
No!

57:32.869 --> 57:34.619
I blew up his core.

57:34.786 --> 57:36.952
Cut him off from time.

57:37.411 --> 57:40.327
And trapped us both down here forever.

57:42.369 --> 57:44.286
But I gave him back enough.

57:44.411 --> 57:46.077
Now that he had his suit back...

57:46.244 --> 57:49.577
he became what he always was.

57:50.494 --> 57:52.244
A conqueror.

57:52.411 --> 57:54.911
He's got weapons and technology...

57:55.119 --> 57:58.744
centuries beyond anything we can dream of.

57:59.619 --> 58:03.411
He took his prison and made it his empire.

58:04.452 --> 58:07.744
I spent years fighting him...

58:07.911 --> 58:10.452
running from him, hiding from him.

58:12.244 --> 58:13.577
And then you saved me.

58:16.911 --> 58:17.911
You brought me home.

58:19.827 --> 58:20.869
But I didn't deserve it.

58:22.702 --> 58:26.286
I unleashed a monster on this place...

58:26.452 --> 58:28.286
and ran away.

58:28.702 --> 58:32.077
Janet, you couldn't have known.

58:34.286 --> 58:36.244
I'm sorry I never told you.

58:37.327 --> 58:39.244
I just wanted to forget.

58:40.661 --> 58:43.036
I just wanted to be your mom again.

58:48.494 --> 58:51.452
I'm so sorry you had to go through
all of that alone.

58:52.369 --> 58:54.994
But you are not alone now.

58:58.619 --> 59:00.077
We'll stop him together.

59:01.119 --> 59:02.535
He's after the core.

59:03.619 --> 59:06.077
But he needs Pym Particles to reach it.

59:06.285 --> 59:09.619
And if he's got Scott and Cassie,
he's got Pym Particles.

59:09.744 --> 59:11.619
-And a head start.
-Exactly.

59:11.744 --> 59:13.452
-We gotta get out of here.
-Hope.

59:13.869 --> 59:15.577
He cannot get out.

59:36.910 --> 59:38.452
You're an interesting man...

59:42.119 --> 59:43.535
Scott Lang.

59:45.202 --> 59:46.369
I don't know who you are...

59:47.785 --> 59:49.327
but you've made a big mistake.

59:49.994 --> 59:51.035
Okay?

59:51.994 --> 59:53.452
I'm an Avenger.

59:54.327 --> 59:55.660
I've called the other Avengers...

59:56.202 --> 59:57.410
You're an Avenger?

59:59.660 --> 01:00:01.577
Have I killed you before?

01:00:02.535 --> 01:00:03.535
What?

01:00:04.369 --> 01:00:06.327
They all blur together after a while.

01:00:08.744 --> 01:00:10.160
You're not the one with the hammer?

01:00:10.327 --> 01:00:11.702
No, that's Thor.

01:00:13.660 --> 01:00:14.660
We get confused a lot.

01:00:14.827 --> 01:00:17.035
Similar body types.
Who are you?

01:00:19.410 --> 01:00:20.535
Just a man...

01:00:21.410 --> 01:00:23.285
who's lost a lot of time.

01:00:23.410 --> 01:00:24.535
Like you.

01:00:26.910 --> 01:00:28.910
But we can help each other with that.

01:00:30.744 --> 01:00:32.910
M.O.D.O.K. tells me you're a good thief.

01:00:33.077 --> 01:00:35.369
Yeah, he stole something from me.

01:00:37.035 --> 01:00:39.369
Do not speak when I am in the room.

01:00:47.369 --> 01:00:49.744
Gotta say, Janet was a lot more helpful.

01:00:50.494 --> 01:00:51.785
You know Janet too?

01:00:53.077 --> 01:00:55.369
Does everyone down here know Janet?

01:00:56.619 --> 01:00:58.244
She didn't tell you about me?

01:01:02.827 --> 01:01:04.452
I guess that's not a surprise.

01:01:07.119 --> 01:01:09.244
Janet stole something from me.

01:01:10.119 --> 01:01:12.702
My ticket out of here.

01:01:15.452 --> 01:01:18.410
And you're the only one
who can steal it back.

01:01:18.744 --> 01:01:20.327
And why would I do that?

01:01:20.452 --> 01:01:22.910
Because you want to get out of here.

01:01:23.619 --> 01:01:27.702
And I need to get out of here.

01:01:30.035 --> 01:01:31.869
Because I know how it ends.

01:01:32.327 --> 01:01:33.702
How what ends?

01:01:37.077 --> 01:01:38.494
All of it.

01:01:41.869 --> 01:01:44.994
I don't live in a straight line.

01:01:47.785 --> 01:01:49.327
And with time...

01:01:50.285 --> 01:01:51.410
it's hard...

01:01:51.869 --> 01:01:53.535
not to skip to the end.

01:01:55.327 --> 01:01:57.494
So, if you want to stop what's coming...

01:01:58.369 --> 01:02:00.535
and trust me...

01:02:00.702 --> 01:02:01.952
you do...

01:02:04.327 --> 01:02:06.452
I am the only shot you have.

01:02:07.077 --> 01:02:08.285
What's coming?

01:02:10.494 --> 01:02:11.410
Me.

01:02:13.369 --> 01:02:15.910
A lot of me.

01:02:20.119 --> 01:02:23.952
They exiled me, down here.

01:02:27.202 --> 01:02:28.827
They're afraid of me.

01:02:34.827 --> 01:02:37.993
But I'm the man who can get you home.

01:02:48.410 --> 01:02:49.868
So, do we have a deal?

01:02:53.327 --> 01:02:55.202
No, I don't think we do.

01:03:04.743 --> 01:03:05.535
Dad!

01:03:05.743 --> 01:03:08.035
Let me make this easy for you.

01:03:08.202 --> 01:03:09.910
You will bring me what I need...

01:03:10.077 --> 01:03:12.410
or I will kill your daughter
in front of you...

01:03:12.535 --> 01:03:14.577
then make you relive that moment...

01:03:14.743 --> 01:03:18.035
over and over again in time, endlessly...

01:03:18.243 --> 01:03:20.702
until you beg me to kill you.

01:03:21.910 --> 01:03:23.410
Do we understand?

01:03:27.077 --> 01:03:28.077
Don't do this.

01:03:31.785 --> 01:03:34.160
I'm a man who likes to be understood.

01:03:37.410 --> 01:03:38.452
Dad.

01:03:39.535 --> 01:03:40.577
Don't listen to him.

01:03:43.410 --> 01:03:44.160
No! No!

01:03:44.410 --> 01:03:45.452
Look, we can talk about this.

01:03:45.827 --> 01:03:46.952
Don't do it!

01:03:47.118 --> 01:03:48.618
You really should do it.

01:03:48.785 --> 01:03:49.785
Please.

01:03:51.535 --> 01:03:53.660
That's my daughter, please.

01:03:53.827 --> 01:03:56.243
Do you want her to live,
or do you want her to die?

01:03:56.452 --> 01:03:57.452
Please!

01:03:57.577 --> 01:03:58.868
You think I'm lying?

01:03:59.993 --> 01:04:01.660
Do I look like a liar to you?

01:04:03.493 --> 01:04:04.493
Stop!

01:04:04.577 --> 01:04:06.118
-Dad!
-I'll do it. I'll do it.

01:04:06.285 --> 01:04:07.785
I'll do it. Just let her go.

01:04:07.952 --> 01:04:09.577
Let her go. Let her go!

01:04:20.160 --> 01:04:21.410
You're out of your league.

01:04:23.452 --> 01:04:24.452
Ant-Man.

01:04:30.702 --> 01:04:32.493
Just be glad I need you.

01:04:45.785 --> 01:04:49.202
Don't touch her again.

01:04:49.660 --> 01:04:51.243
Then give me what I need.

01:04:52.993 --> 01:04:54.285
Where is it?

01:05:35.785 --> 01:05:37.202
What is that?

01:05:37.368 --> 01:05:39.743
It was a multiversal engine core.

01:05:41.368 --> 01:05:44.910
A power source that can take you anywhere
in space and time.

01:05:46.618 --> 01:05:48.285
Then Janet blew it up.

01:05:52.577 --> 01:05:53.868
It's in that?

01:05:54.035 --> 01:05:55.910
It is that.

01:05:56.077 --> 01:05:58.118
And we have to get to the center.

01:05:58.951 --> 01:06:00.410
That's good to know.

01:06:02.243 --> 01:06:05.410
You'll have to shrink down and
pass through the eye of the storm.

01:06:05.576 --> 01:06:08.285
Once you're inside, find the core...

01:06:08.410 --> 01:06:10.118
and size it back down.

01:06:10.326 --> 01:06:11.701
What does it look like?

01:06:11.868 --> 01:06:14.118
When I steal something,
I usually know what I'm stealing.

01:06:14.326 --> 01:06:15.868
You'll know it when you see it.

01:06:16.035 --> 01:06:18.410
Get in and out as fast as you can.

01:06:18.535 --> 01:06:21.826
The longer you're in there,
the more your mind will come undone.

01:06:24.743 --> 01:06:25.743
Better hurry.

01:06:26.993 --> 01:06:27.951
Dad!

01:06:30.451 --> 01:06:31.743
I'm sorry.

01:06:32.285 --> 01:06:33.743
This is all my fault.

01:06:35.201 --> 01:06:37.076
Hey, hey, hey.

01:06:37.493 --> 01:06:38.493
No.

01:06:40.035 --> 01:06:41.326
I messed up.

01:06:41.910 --> 01:06:42.743
Cassie.

01:06:43.743 --> 01:06:45.910
My whole life happened because I messed up.

01:06:47.451 --> 01:06:50.035
The only thing I didn't mess up is you.

01:06:53.243 --> 01:06:54.410
Dad!

01:06:55.118 --> 01:06:56.076
It's okay.

01:06:56.285 --> 01:06:57.368
It's okay.

01:07:00.118 --> 01:07:01.535
I love you, Peanut.

01:07:02.743 --> 01:07:04.618
I love you too.

01:07:48.660 --> 01:07:50.451
Okay. I'm in.

01:07:53.451 --> 01:07:55.493
Darren, can you hear me?

01:07:55.618 --> 01:07:56.576
Darren?

01:07:57.743 --> 01:07:58.743
Darren?

01:08:01.285 --> 01:08:02.993
M.O.D.O.K., can you hear me?

01:08:03.201 --> 01:08:04.285
What?

01:08:04.660 --> 01:08:06.243
-I'm in.
-Okay.

01:08:06.743 --> 01:08:09.451
Okay, so what do I do? What's the plan?

01:08:10.993 --> 01:08:12.201
Don't die?

01:08:13.368 --> 01:08:15.743
Thanks. Big help, M.O.D.O.K.

01:08:15.951 --> 01:08:17.160
Do you see it?

01:08:18.535 --> 01:08:19.701
Yeah. I see it.

01:08:24.910 --> 01:08:26.368
I'm heading in.

01:08:29.743 --> 01:08:30.701
What the hell?

01:08:30.868 --> 01:08:31.743
What the hell?

01:08:31.910 --> 01:08:32.743
What the hell?

01:08:32.910 --> 01:08:35.576
I told you, Scott.
Getting in was just the beginning.

01:08:35.785 --> 01:08:36.910
You never said that.

01:08:37.076 --> 01:08:38.326
Why am I looking at another me?

01:08:38.451 --> 01:08:40.035
I'm not another me. You're another me.

01:08:40.243 --> 01:08:41.118
You just came out...

01:08:41.326 --> 01:08:42.868
Why am I looking at another me?

01:08:43.076 --> 01:08:46.285
You're looking at the possibility
of another you.

01:08:46.410 --> 01:08:48.201
You're in a Probability Storm.

01:08:48.368 --> 01:08:50.451
What does any of that mean?

01:08:50.618 --> 01:08:52.285
-You don't know?
-Why would I know?

01:08:52.451 --> 01:08:53.410
Because you got me in here.

01:08:53.535 --> 01:08:54.743
So, I am the real one, huh?

01:08:54.910 --> 01:08:55.826
No. I didn't say that.

01:08:57.368 --> 01:08:58.618
-What the hell?
-What the hell?

01:08:58.785 --> 01:08:59.701
-What the hell?
-What the hell?

01:08:59.868 --> 01:09:00.910
-Wait. Wait, wait.
-What the hell?

01:09:01.076 --> 01:09:02.118
What the hell?

01:09:03.285 --> 01:09:04.243
What is this place?

01:09:04.368 --> 01:09:06.410
It's a Probability Storm.

01:09:06.951 --> 01:09:09.451
Every choice you could make,
existing all at once.

01:09:09.576 --> 01:09:10.993
What is he saying? What's he saying?

01:09:11.410 --> 01:09:13.660
-What's he saying?
-You're inside Schrödinger's box.

01:09:13.785 --> 01:09:14.785
And you're the cat.

01:09:14.951 --> 01:09:16.451
-That doesn't make sense.
-Oh, I get it.

01:09:16.618 --> 01:09:18.326
Nobody move! All right? Nobody move!

01:09:18.493 --> 01:09:20.618
Why should we listen to you?
You're not even the real one.

01:09:20.785 --> 01:09:21.826
-What the hell?
-Am I real?

01:09:21.993 --> 01:09:22.868
-Am I real?
-Am I real?

01:09:23.035 --> 01:09:24.326
-I am the real one!
-What the hell?

01:09:24.451 --> 01:09:26.410
What the hell. I'm the real one.

01:09:26.535 --> 01:09:28.076
Guys. Hey, relax.

01:09:28.283 --> 01:09:29.908
Take it easy. Breathe.

01:09:30.076 --> 01:09:32.158
We'll figure this out. Together.

01:09:32.368 --> 01:09:33.368
Who are you?

01:09:33.493 --> 01:09:34.826
Why are you dressed like that?

01:09:35.783 --> 01:09:37.368
Because I work at Baskin-Robbins.

01:09:37.493 --> 01:09:39.283
This is my uniform.

01:09:39.451 --> 01:09:40.701
These are normal clothes.

01:09:40.826 --> 01:09:42.118
Why are you dressed like that?

01:09:42.243 --> 01:09:43.783
-Do you have ice cream?
-Enough!

01:09:43.951 --> 01:09:44.993
Let's do this!

01:09:53.158 --> 01:09:54.659
Oh, we're all gonna die.

01:09:57.076 --> 01:09:58.076
Wait.

01:09:58.659 --> 01:09:59.868
Wait. Wait!

01:10:00.034 --> 01:10:01.118
No! No!

01:10:01.701 --> 01:10:03.784
No! Wait! No!

01:10:03.909 --> 01:10:05.284
I've got a read on Scott.

01:10:20.868 --> 01:10:21.826
Out of the way!

01:10:22.034 --> 01:10:24.118
-Mom! What is this?
-What are you doing?

01:10:24.326 --> 01:10:25.993
Don't look at them.
They're just possibilities.

01:10:27.368 --> 01:10:28.618
They're not you.

01:10:28.909 --> 01:10:30.868
Scott, where are you?

01:10:35.118 --> 01:10:36.159
Why am I here?

01:10:37.159 --> 01:10:39.034
Don't worry. It'll work this time.

01:10:39.201 --> 01:10:40.993
What are you... Wait, wait, no, no. Stop.

01:10:41.159 --> 01:10:43.618
-Stop! No!
-I got this, guys.

01:10:48.993 --> 01:10:50.993
I got this!
I got it!

01:10:55.493 --> 01:10:56.659
Scott, where are you?

01:10:57.201 --> 01:10:58.201
Scott!

01:11:01.701 --> 01:11:03.284
Where are you, Scott?

01:11:04.576 --> 01:11:06.451
-I can't breathe.
-Ow, that's my neck.

01:11:08.034 --> 01:11:09.159
Stop kicking me!

01:11:11.784 --> 01:11:13.451
-My back!
-We're all gonna die!

01:11:14.576 --> 01:11:15.576
Dad.

01:11:18.493 --> 01:11:19.701
Come back.

01:11:20.493 --> 01:11:21.618
Dad...

01:11:22.409 --> 01:11:23.826
if you can hear me...

01:11:24.409 --> 01:11:26.909
come back.
Just come back.

01:11:27.951 --> 01:11:29.493
-Don't give up.
-Come on.

01:11:30.368 --> 01:11:32.284
-Dad, just come back one more time.
-Come on.

01:11:32.451 --> 01:11:34.034
-She needs us.
-Please.

01:11:34.201 --> 01:11:35.743
-Yes, come on.
-Come back.

01:11:35.826 --> 01:11:37.784
She needs us.
Let's do it together.

01:11:37.868 --> 01:11:39.993
-Get him up! Get him up!
-Grab him! Grab him!

01:11:40.076 --> 01:11:41.368
Let's go.

01:11:42.201 --> 01:11:44.201
-Come on, lift him!
-Yes!

01:11:44.451 --> 01:11:46.618
-I got ya, I got ya! Go.
-Come on. That's it.

01:11:46.784 --> 01:11:48.618
-Come on!
-Give him a boost! Give him a boost!

01:11:50.826 --> 01:11:53.326
Come on, we're doing it for Cassie!
Fellas, let's go!

01:11:53.493 --> 01:11:55.201
Everyone together!

01:11:55.368 --> 01:11:56.409
What are you doing?

01:11:57.159 --> 01:11:58.701
How are you able to do that?

01:11:58.868 --> 01:11:59.868
I'll tell you how.

01:12:01.534 --> 01:12:03.118
We all want the same thing.

01:12:05.034 --> 01:12:06.784
And I'm coming, Cassie.

01:12:15.409 --> 01:12:16.784
Go get her, pal.

01:12:22.159 --> 01:12:23.659
Everyone, let's go!

01:12:26.034 --> 01:12:27.326
Come on!

01:12:35.243 --> 01:12:36.243
Come on, closer.

01:12:36.451 --> 01:12:37.284
Get him higher!

01:12:37.493 --> 01:12:39.118
Hang on, guys, hang on.

01:12:40.493 --> 01:12:42.034
Careful. Steady, steady.

01:12:45.076 --> 01:12:46.826
Steady. That's it.

01:12:47.034 --> 01:12:48.034
Let's go.

01:12:54.451 --> 01:12:55.451
What?

01:12:58.951 --> 01:13:00.617
-Oh no.
-What happened? Did it work?

01:13:00.742 --> 01:13:02.451
Sorry, buddy!

01:13:02.659 --> 01:13:04.326
-No, no, no.
-No, no, no.

01:13:14.201 --> 01:13:16.201
Hope, are you real?

01:13:16.659 --> 01:13:17.992
I'm real.

01:13:18.576 --> 01:13:19.576
Then let's do this.

01:13:24.659 --> 01:13:25.909
You ready?

01:13:26.076 --> 01:13:27.076
Ready.

01:14:12.909 --> 01:14:13.992
Come on.

01:14:14.201 --> 01:14:15.242
We gotta get that thing out of here.

01:14:15.409 --> 01:14:16.242
No, no, no. Wait.

01:14:16.409 --> 01:14:17.492
He's got Cassie.

01:14:18.034 --> 01:14:19.284
-What?
-Scott.

01:14:19.784 --> 01:14:21.867
-Janet.
-Give that to me.

01:14:22.076 --> 01:14:22.909
-We have to go now.
-No.

01:14:23.117 --> 01:14:24.284
He's got Cassie.

01:14:24.701 --> 01:14:27.159
We will save her. I promise you
we will save her...

01:14:28.659 --> 01:14:30.492
but you cannot give that to him.

01:14:30.951 --> 01:14:32.201
I wouldn't trust her.

01:14:36.117 --> 01:14:37.826
Janet has a way of...

01:14:40.909 --> 01:14:42.367
changing her mind.

01:14:49.242 --> 01:14:51.742
Hello, Jellybean.

01:14:57.909 --> 01:14:58.992
So...

01:15:02.742 --> 01:15:04.409
what's it gonna be, Scott?

01:15:07.951 --> 01:15:10.242
Well, well.

01:15:11.409 --> 01:15:14.242
If it isn't my old mentor.

01:15:18.784 --> 01:15:19.576
Hi, Hank.

01:15:23.242 --> 01:15:24.242
Darren?

01:15:24.826 --> 01:15:27.326
Didn't expect to see
your protégé again after all...

01:15:27.492 --> 01:15:29.242
Holy shit, Darren.

01:15:30.201 --> 01:15:31.492
What happened to you?

01:15:31.659 --> 01:15:34.117
I'm the ultimate weapon!

01:15:44.701 --> 01:15:46.326
Do I need to take it?

01:15:46.784 --> 01:15:47.992
Where is my daughter?

01:15:50.117 --> 01:15:51.117
Scott.

01:15:52.409 --> 01:15:53.409
Don't.

01:15:54.326 --> 01:15:56.534
We had a deal.

01:15:57.159 --> 01:15:58.534
She'll be fine without you.

01:16:24.034 --> 01:16:25.700
So long, Hank.

01:16:33.242 --> 01:16:34.284
Henry.

01:16:41.409 --> 01:16:43.659
You left me right here to die.

01:16:47.825 --> 01:16:49.367
Let's see how they do.

01:17:50.159 --> 01:17:51.575
What did you see?

01:18:00.409 --> 01:18:03.700
We didn't really get a chance
to talk about it last time.

01:18:05.700 --> 01:18:06.825
But I always wondered.

01:18:10.575 --> 01:18:12.534
When you touched my mind...

01:18:23.992 --> 01:18:25.742
what did you see?

01:18:26.575 --> 01:18:27.825
A monster...

01:18:29.284 --> 01:18:30.742
who thinks he's a god.

01:18:31.117 --> 01:18:33.534
When you can see time the way I do...

01:18:33.742 --> 01:18:35.617
you don't get to close your eyes.

01:18:35.825 --> 01:18:38.492
And you're the only one who sees?

01:18:38.659 --> 01:18:43.450
I am the only one that can see it's broken.

01:18:43.659 --> 01:18:44.825
And who broke it?

01:18:47.409 --> 01:18:48.534
I did.

01:18:49.742 --> 01:18:52.742
Every version of me.

01:18:53.950 --> 01:18:55.409
My variants.

01:18:56.117 --> 01:18:57.492
Throughout the Multiverse.

01:18:59.784 --> 01:19:02.992
Playing with time, like children.

01:19:05.409 --> 01:19:08.450
But I saw how it ends.

01:19:09.659 --> 01:19:11.700
I saw their chaos...

01:19:12.534 --> 01:19:15.492
spreading across realities.

01:19:16.617 --> 01:19:18.867
Universes colliding.

01:19:20.325 --> 01:19:21.534
Endless incursions.

01:19:22.909 --> 01:19:24.867
I saw the Multiverse.

01:19:26.034 --> 01:19:27.450
And it was dying.

01:19:29.159 --> 01:19:30.492
All because of them.

01:19:31.950 --> 01:19:33.784
So, I took control.

01:19:34.534 --> 01:19:36.450
You mean you started a war.

01:19:37.200 --> 01:19:40.534
And now you wanna wipe away
any universe that's a threat to you.

01:19:41.617 --> 01:19:43.200
That's what monsters do.

01:19:43.409 --> 01:19:46.200
That's what conquerors do.

01:19:46.617 --> 01:19:49.492
They burn the broken world.

01:19:50.492 --> 01:19:53.283
And they make a new one.

01:19:53.450 --> 01:19:56.367
You don't care about saving
anything or anyone.

01:19:58.492 --> 01:20:00.742
You only want revenge because they beat you.

01:20:01.700 --> 01:20:02.658
Because you lost.

01:20:02.992 --> 01:20:04.867
I have lost.

01:20:06.575 --> 01:20:10.658
You have no idea what I have lost.

01:20:12.200 --> 01:20:16.075
And I will burn them out of time...

01:20:16.242 --> 01:20:17.658
for what they've done to me.

01:20:18.617 --> 01:20:22.617
You'll be wiping out entire timelines.

01:20:23.325 --> 01:20:26.492
Murdering trillions of people.

01:20:27.533 --> 01:20:30.033
I wish that mattered, Janet.

01:20:51.950 --> 01:20:53.450
Oh, God. What am I doing?

01:21:04.283 --> 01:21:05.408
What?

01:21:09.617 --> 01:21:10.533
Hank!

01:21:14.325 --> 01:21:15.533
Are these your ants?

01:21:16.283 --> 01:21:17.325
From the ant farm?

01:21:17.492 --> 01:21:19.367
Yes, Scott, they're my ants.

01:21:19.700 --> 01:21:21.158
How did you find them down here?

01:21:22.742 --> 01:21:25.283
I've been picking up strange signals
ever since we crashed.

01:21:27.492 --> 01:21:30.117
First I thought maybe it was a malfunction.

01:21:30.283 --> 01:21:31.867
Some kind of interference.

01:21:32.033 --> 01:21:33.908
What is that?

01:21:34.117 --> 01:21:35.242
But it wasn't.

01:21:36.533 --> 01:21:37.742
It was the ants.

01:21:39.700 --> 01:21:42.617
They were reaching out the whole time.

01:21:44.117 --> 01:21:47.575
Apparently, they passed through
some sort of time dilation.

01:21:48.158 --> 01:21:50.950
They've lived thousands of years
in a single day...

01:21:51.533 --> 01:21:54.492
expanding their knowledge,
their science...

01:21:54.825 --> 01:21:57.658
becoming more advanced
than I could have ever thought.

01:21:58.033 --> 01:21:59.408
I didn't find them.

01:22:00.325 --> 01:22:01.533
They found me.

01:22:03.617 --> 01:22:05.325
I told you they were smart.

01:22:07.700 --> 01:22:12.742
They've already built something
of a technocratic Class-Two civilization.

01:22:12.992 --> 01:22:15.908
I mean, I know socialism is a charged word...

01:22:16.033 --> 01:22:18.950
-but we could learn a lot from these...
-Dad.

01:22:20.033 --> 01:22:21.325
Yeah, they're my ants.

01:22:22.117 --> 01:22:24.117
And ants don't give up.

01:22:24.325 --> 01:22:25.492
I don't care who this guy is.

01:22:25.658 --> 01:22:26.867
I don't care what he can do.

01:22:27.075 --> 01:22:28.117
I'm getting Cassie.

01:22:28.450 --> 01:22:30.658
So, how do we even the odds against Kang?

01:22:33.783 --> 01:22:35.283
We've got some ideas.

01:22:35.408 --> 01:22:36.408
What are you thinking?

01:22:36.575 --> 01:22:39.575
Well, as a great writer once said...

01:22:40.533 --> 01:22:42.783
"There's always room to grow."

01:22:45.158 --> 01:22:46.242
You read my book?

01:22:46.950 --> 01:22:50.367
Every goddamn word.

01:22:52.908 --> 01:22:54.367
Come on. Let's go to work.

01:23:07.283 --> 01:23:09.117
Hey! I'm sorry.

01:23:09.283 --> 01:23:11.117
That was probably terrifying.

01:23:11.283 --> 01:23:12.533
What are you doing here?

01:23:13.325 --> 01:23:14.408
I'm rescuing you.

01:23:14.783 --> 01:23:15.783
How?

01:23:17.450 --> 01:23:18.992
That's a good question.

01:23:19.617 --> 01:23:22.366
Does this thing have like a key?

01:23:22.491 --> 01:23:24.491
Or a card? Like a room key?

01:23:24.658 --> 01:23:25.825
Do you know, like a...

01:23:27.825 --> 01:23:28.825
Shit!

01:23:36.491 --> 01:23:37.491
Jump and tap.

01:23:46.575 --> 01:23:47.616
Jentorra.

01:23:48.991 --> 01:23:50.825
I'm sorry I got your people hurt.

01:23:52.533 --> 01:23:53.533
How can I help?

01:23:58.700 --> 01:23:59.741
Wow.

01:23:59.908 --> 01:24:01.075
Let's hurt 'em back.

01:24:02.325 --> 01:24:03.450
Damn, you're cool.

01:24:04.408 --> 01:24:05.408
Do you have a plan?

01:24:05.491 --> 01:24:06.741
Freeing you was basically my plan.

01:24:07.866 --> 01:24:08.950
Do you have a plan?

01:24:09.158 --> 01:24:11.200
We need to get a message out
to anyone who can still fight.

01:24:11.825 --> 01:24:13.533
Then free our people
from the detention cells below...

01:24:13.700 --> 01:24:14.908
and launch a counteroffensive from within.

01:24:15.075 --> 01:24:17.283
Yeah, you have a plan.
So, how do we get a message out?

01:24:17.491 --> 01:24:18.408
Follow me.

01:24:18.575 --> 01:24:20.033
Okay. Great.

01:24:24.450 --> 01:24:27.366
I built an empire down here, Janet.

01:24:29.783 --> 01:24:31.408
And I'm taking it with me.

01:24:47.491 --> 01:24:50.241
You really should've let me out
when you had the chance.

01:24:59.241 --> 01:25:02.325
History is not written.

01:25:04.325 --> 01:25:05.575
It is forged.

01:25:06.366 --> 01:25:08.283
Today, we ascend.

01:25:09.116 --> 01:25:14.116
From this fortress, I will take my revenge
on those who banished me.

01:25:15.575 --> 01:25:18.950
Today we conquer eternity.

01:25:19.741 --> 01:25:21.908
And the dynasty of Kang shall...

01:25:25.825 --> 01:25:27.533
Hello? Is this working?

01:25:28.158 --> 01:25:29.158
Cassie?

01:25:29.283 --> 01:25:31.200
I can't tell if this is working.

01:25:32.533 --> 01:25:34.033
Okay. I think we're on.

01:25:34.200 --> 01:25:35.616
I'll hold them off. Get the message out.

01:25:35.783 --> 01:25:37.450
I thought you were getting the message out.

01:25:39.116 --> 01:25:39.950
Now!

01:25:41.408 --> 01:25:43.575
We're inside.
We breached the tower.

01:25:43.783 --> 01:25:44.783
And I'm with Jentorra.

01:25:44.950 --> 01:25:46.325
He's not invincible.

01:25:52.575 --> 01:25:54.575
I know it might feel like...

01:25:54.700 --> 01:25:56.116
it's too late...

01:25:57.741 --> 01:25:59.825
like all we do is just lose.

01:26:00.325 --> 01:26:01.950
But the family I've lost...

01:26:02.575 --> 01:26:04.200
taught me to keep fighting.

01:26:04.325 --> 01:26:06.241
And if they were here, they would too.

01:26:07.116 --> 01:26:09.116
We need to look out for the little guy.

01:26:09.575 --> 01:26:11.033
My dad taught me that.

01:26:11.450 --> 01:26:13.283
'Cause when people needed help...

01:26:13.783 --> 01:26:15.616
he didn't look the other way.

01:26:16.200 --> 01:26:17.366
And neither do we.

01:26:19.658 --> 01:26:20.658
We need to move!

01:26:20.783 --> 01:26:23.158
Come to the tower! Fight back!

01:26:23.325 --> 01:26:25.700
I know you've been waiting.
Now is the time to strike.

01:26:25.866 --> 01:26:27.991
He knows he can't take all of us.

01:26:28.200 --> 01:26:29.283
Come to the...

01:26:29.450 --> 01:26:30.491
Cassie.

01:26:30.658 --> 01:26:32.616
I think I found the signal.
Mom's gotta be there, too.

01:26:32.825 --> 01:26:34.408
-Let's go.
-I'll drive.

01:26:40.533 --> 01:26:41.866
Find Lang's daughter.

01:26:45.283 --> 01:26:46.325
Kill her.

01:27:05.366 --> 01:27:06.408
Let's go. Let's go!

01:27:06.949 --> 01:27:08.283
If you want to fight, follow me!

01:27:13.074 --> 01:27:14.324
It's over, Cassie.

01:27:14.741 --> 01:27:16.408
Free the others. Go!

01:27:24.533 --> 01:27:25.616
He's gonna see us coming.

01:27:25.783 --> 01:27:27.824
Yeah. I'll make sure of it.

01:27:28.741 --> 01:27:29.908
Begin the launch.

01:28:21.866 --> 01:28:23.616
Your dad's not here, Cassie...

01:28:23.866 --> 01:28:25.824
but I guess that's not a big surprise.

01:28:49.283 --> 01:28:50.449
Kang!

01:28:51.616 --> 01:28:53.491
We had a deal.

01:28:55.616 --> 01:28:57.908
You took my daughter!

01:29:00.324 --> 01:29:01.699
Holy shit.

01:29:02.324 --> 01:29:03.533
That's big.

01:29:12.283 --> 01:29:13.949
You lied to me!

01:29:15.199 --> 01:29:17.366
Our word is our bond.

01:29:18.158 --> 01:29:21.324
Without that, we're nothing!

01:29:22.074 --> 01:29:23.074
Bring him down.

01:29:23.283 --> 01:29:24.116
Yes, sir.

01:29:30.949 --> 01:29:32.241
Keep going. I've got them.

01:29:34.199 --> 01:29:35.491
Yeah, come on!

01:29:50.033 --> 01:29:51.199
There's so many!

01:29:51.408 --> 01:29:53.658
Scott! I can't hold them!

01:30:04.741 --> 01:30:05.783
They came.

01:30:07.574 --> 01:30:09.574
Way to go, Cassie!

01:30:11.991 --> 01:30:13.074
Yes!

01:30:13.408 --> 01:30:15.824
Come on! Let's go!

01:30:20.824 --> 01:30:22.699
Revolution!

01:30:35.866 --> 01:30:37.907
Burn it all down.

01:30:38.074 --> 01:30:39.241
Fight!

01:30:56.532 --> 01:30:58.407
Cover! Get down!

01:31:07.074 --> 01:31:08.574
What is the bridge code?

01:31:09.116 --> 01:31:10.199
I'll die first.

01:31:10.866 --> 01:31:12.116
One-eight-one-four-seven.

01:31:12.491 --> 01:31:13.366
Damn!

01:31:28.866 --> 01:31:30.032
You'll need this.

01:31:32.449 --> 01:31:33.199
Hi.

01:31:34.157 --> 01:31:35.157
This is our home!

01:31:36.157 --> 01:31:37.449
Let's take it back!

01:31:42.032 --> 01:31:43.032
No!

01:31:50.282 --> 01:31:52.199
I have holes.

01:31:54.032 --> 01:31:56.657
I have holes!

01:32:03.282 --> 01:32:04.657
I didn't know he could do that.

01:32:14.407 --> 01:32:15.407
Kang!

01:32:15.991 --> 01:32:17.241
Where is she?

01:32:17.907 --> 01:32:19.199
Launch now!

01:32:30.407 --> 01:32:31.907
What is that?

01:32:32.324 --> 01:32:33.741
He's getting out.

01:32:34.199 --> 01:32:35.366
Oh, no, he's not.

01:32:43.032 --> 01:32:44.574
Keep him away from the rings.

01:33:23.782 --> 01:33:24.866
Dad!

01:33:27.741 --> 01:33:29.074
Dad, I'm coming!

01:33:40.574 --> 01:33:41.574
Dad!

01:33:49.907 --> 01:33:51.449
Nowhere left to run.

01:34:00.365 --> 01:34:01.490
Please let this work.

01:34:19.949 --> 01:34:21.490
Hey, where do you think you're going?

01:34:21.657 --> 01:34:22.615
Let's go.

01:34:22.990 --> 01:34:24.740
You think this is over? Come on! Let's go.

01:34:24.907 --> 01:34:26.449
Darren, just stop...

01:34:26.907 --> 01:34:29.282
trying to be whatever this is.

01:34:30.074 --> 01:34:31.532
I don't know what to be.

01:34:33.615 --> 01:34:35.199
Tell me what to be.

01:34:35.449 --> 01:34:37.615
I don't know.
Just don't be a dick.

01:34:38.365 --> 01:34:39.740
It's too late.

01:34:40.365 --> 01:34:41.532
Look at me.

01:34:43.115 --> 01:34:44.657
I'm such a dick.

01:34:45.032 --> 01:34:47.449
It's never too late to stop being a dick.

01:34:53.282 --> 01:34:54.365
We've gotta stop him.

01:34:56.282 --> 01:34:57.574
I have an idea.

01:35:00.365 --> 01:35:01.199
Ready?

01:35:01.365 --> 01:35:02.490
Probably not.

01:35:05.324 --> 01:35:07.740
One, two, three. Now!

01:35:30.740 --> 01:35:32.074
Dad!

01:35:32.449 --> 01:35:33.365
Dad!

01:35:34.199 --> 01:35:35.199
Cassie?

01:35:37.199 --> 01:35:38.074
You're huge.

01:35:38.240 --> 01:35:39.865
I'm huge.

01:35:44.324 --> 01:35:45.824
I love you, Peanut.

01:35:46.032 --> 01:35:47.407
I love you too.

01:35:47.699 --> 01:35:49.365
I'm so proud of you.

01:35:50.032 --> 01:35:52.074
I feel like I'm hugging Godzilla.

01:35:52.324 --> 01:35:54.824
I know. It feels so cool.

01:35:55.115 --> 01:35:56.824
I know, right?

01:35:57.574 --> 01:35:58.699
I'm so hungry.

01:35:58.865 --> 01:35:59.865
Yeah, that happens.

01:35:59.990 --> 01:36:02.199
-I could eat everything.
-Everything. I know.

01:36:02.740 --> 01:36:05.074
-But I really want like a lime.
-Right?

01:36:05.240 --> 01:36:07.282
-Citrus. It's weird. I know.
-Citrus.

01:36:07.407 --> 01:36:08.407
It's...

01:36:19.157 --> 01:36:20.574
Take the tower!

01:36:52.157 --> 01:36:53.365
It's over.

01:36:55.324 --> 01:36:57.324
You still can't see it.

01:36:59.324 --> 01:37:02.282
It's never over.

01:38:18.948 --> 01:38:20.698
-We have to go, right now.
-No.

01:38:20.865 --> 01:38:21.865
-Come on.
-No!

01:38:22.032 --> 01:38:23.198
I know, I know, but we have to go.

01:38:23.365 --> 01:38:24.698
-No!
-Come on.

01:39:14.907 --> 01:39:16.115
You son of a...

01:39:19.240 --> 01:39:20.740
-Oh, God.
-Scott.

01:39:21.032 --> 01:39:22.032
Come on.

01:39:26.782 --> 01:39:29.407
You think this is new to me?

01:39:30.698 --> 01:39:35.448
Do you know how many rebellions
I have put down?

01:39:37.115 --> 01:39:38.615
No, no, no.

01:39:38.740 --> 01:39:42.323
How many worlds I've conquered?

01:39:43.157 --> 01:39:45.407
How many Avengers I've killed?

01:39:45.573 --> 01:39:48.115
And you think you can beat me?

01:39:48.282 --> 01:39:49.907
I am Kang!

01:39:50.073 --> 01:39:50.990
You...

01:39:52.032 --> 01:39:54.323
You talk to ants.

01:41:14.115 --> 01:41:16.698
My name is Darren...

01:41:16.823 --> 01:41:21.365
and I am not a dick!

01:41:42.823 --> 01:41:44.073
Sorry I'm late.

01:41:46.448 --> 01:41:47.698
Lotta ants.

01:41:49.115 --> 01:41:50.115
Oh, is this you?

01:41:51.781 --> 01:41:53.198
You were right about me, Cassie.

01:41:54.531 --> 01:41:55.531
Darren.

01:41:57.281 --> 01:41:58.281
Are you okay?

01:42:01.115 --> 01:42:02.281
Probably not.

01:42:03.615 --> 01:42:05.323
-Darren?
-Hi, Hope.

01:42:06.281 --> 01:42:07.740
You changed your hair.

01:42:10.490 --> 01:42:12.365
What the hell happened?

01:42:13.156 --> 01:42:13.948
Yeah. No...

01:42:14.490 --> 01:42:15.948
It's a whole thing. I'll tell you later.

01:42:16.740 --> 01:42:17.740
That was...

01:42:18.240 --> 01:42:19.698
I don't know what to say.

01:42:20.240 --> 01:42:21.573
Thanks, Scott.

01:42:22.156 --> 01:42:25.365
You always were a brother to me.

01:42:27.531 --> 01:42:28.531
I was?

01:42:36.448 --> 01:42:37.531
I was.

01:42:51.615 --> 01:42:53.281
And at least I died...

01:42:54.865 --> 01:42:56.406
an Avenger.

01:42:59.615 --> 01:43:00.656
Yeah.

01:43:01.698 --> 01:43:02.615
-You did.
-Yeah.

01:43:03.490 --> 01:43:04.490
You're in.

01:43:21.156 --> 01:43:22.698
A lot has happened today.

01:43:23.531 --> 01:43:24.615
-Henry?
-Janet?

01:43:24.781 --> 01:43:26.656
-Mom, where are you?
-I'm in the tower.

01:43:26.781 --> 01:43:28.781
I think I can give us one shot back.

01:43:28.990 --> 01:43:30.781
But we don't have much time.

01:43:30.990 --> 01:43:32.615
If we wanna go home...

01:43:35.073 --> 01:43:36.448
we have to go now.

01:43:37.115 --> 01:43:38.115
We'll finish this.

01:43:40.365 --> 01:43:41.406
Thank you.

01:43:42.490 --> 01:43:43.365
Thank you.

01:43:45.448 --> 01:43:47.073
Come on! Let's go!

01:43:47.240 --> 01:43:48.406
All right. Good luck.

01:43:48.740 --> 01:43:49.823
Good luck.
Come on.

01:44:20.531 --> 01:44:21.531
Thanks, buddy.

01:44:23.864 --> 01:44:24.864
You did it.

01:44:28.614 --> 01:44:29.781
Let's go home.

01:44:51.656 --> 01:44:52.614
Where's Scott?

01:44:52.823 --> 01:44:54.323
He was right behind me.

01:45:37.406 --> 01:45:39.031
You should've looked the other way.

01:45:39.198 --> 01:45:41.864
Yeah, well, never been great at that.

01:45:49.781 --> 01:45:51.323
And you're not getting out.

01:46:01.906 --> 01:46:03.323
I want you to remember.

01:46:04.823 --> 01:46:06.364
You could've gone home.

01:46:21.489 --> 01:46:23.531
You could've seen your daughter again.

01:46:37.364 --> 01:46:38.698
But you thought you could win.

01:46:52.073 --> 01:46:53.573
I don't have to win.

01:46:55.114 --> 01:46:57.031
We both just have to lose.

01:47:47.989 --> 01:47:49.322
Dad!

01:47:56.489 --> 01:47:57.489
Where... Where...

01:47:57.739 --> 01:47:58.822
Where is she? Is she...

01:47:58.989 --> 01:48:00.572
-No, she's okay.
-Where is she?

01:48:00.739 --> 01:48:02.072
She's okay. She's okay.

01:48:02.531 --> 01:48:03.947
-Scott, they're all okay. They're all okay.
-She's safe?

01:48:04.156 --> 01:48:05.156
You did it.

01:48:05.322 --> 01:48:06.322
You did it.

01:48:09.739 --> 01:48:11.614
-Sorry. Sorry, sorry.
-No, no, no.

01:48:11.822 --> 01:48:13.281
No, don't let go. Don't let go.

01:48:13.864 --> 01:48:15.031
Don't let go.

01:48:15.239 --> 01:48:16.406
Don't ever let go.

01:48:18.072 --> 01:48:19.406
I got you.

01:48:22.239 --> 01:48:23.406
You came back.

01:48:33.739 --> 01:48:35.031
I love you, Hope.

01:48:37.656 --> 01:48:39.031
I love you, Scott.

01:49:52.697 --> 01:49:54.072
Let's go home.

01:49:56.656 --> 01:49:57.906
Home's good.

01:50:06.364 --> 01:50:07.989
My life doesn't make sense.

01:50:08.197 --> 01:50:10.531
I used to ask myself a lot of questions
about that.

01:50:10.697 --> 01:50:13.364
"Scott you just saved the Quantum Realm
with your family...

01:50:13.572 --> 01:50:15.406
"and drank a guy without holes.

01:50:15.614 --> 01:50:17.864
"Why does this kind of stuff keep
happening to you?

01:50:18.031 --> 01:50:19.489
"That doesn't make any sense."

01:50:19.656 --> 01:50:21.031
But you know what?

01:50:21.239 --> 01:50:23.239
Who said life has to make sense?

01:50:27.531 --> 01:50:28.531
Rubin!

01:50:28.656 --> 01:50:29.864
You are the bug!

01:50:31.156 --> 01:50:33.656
I was wrong. Yeah.
You are the other bug.

01:50:33.822 --> 01:50:35.114
You're the bug man.

01:50:35.281 --> 01:50:37.864
You get big and get small
like a big bug!

01:50:38.531 --> 01:50:41.156
You're right. That's me.
Just a coffee, please.

01:50:41.281 --> 01:50:42.281
Twelve dollar.

01:50:44.197 --> 01:50:45.239
Twelve!

01:50:45.364 --> 01:50:47.947
I used to wonder if this
chapter in my life was over...

01:50:48.156 --> 01:50:51.322
but as Cassie reminded me,
"There's always someone you can help."

01:50:52.031 --> 01:50:54.447
Came out of cake making
retirement for you.

01:50:56.864 --> 01:50:57.864
Wow.

01:50:58.614 --> 01:50:59.906
You made this yourself?

01:51:00.031 --> 01:51:02.447
-Yeah! I don't usually make the cakes.
-I know.

01:51:02.656 --> 01:51:04.406
This is the first one I've made since 1997.

01:51:04.614 --> 01:51:05.822
You're a real artist.

01:51:05.989 --> 01:51:07.947
It's been a pretty wild ride.

01:51:08.155 --> 01:51:10.489
One day you're fired from Baskin-Robbins...

01:51:10.655 --> 01:51:13.447
the next you're beating a time-traveling
space king.

01:51:14.530 --> 01:51:16.530
We did beat him, right?

01:51:17.947 --> 01:51:19.239
I mean, yeah, that's what happened.

01:51:19.364 --> 01:51:21.530
He was getting out and he didn't get out.

01:51:22.947 --> 01:51:24.030
I think.

01:51:25.572 --> 01:51:28.197
But he also said something bad was coming...

01:51:28.614 --> 01:51:31.655
and that everyone would die
if he didn't get out.

01:51:31.864 --> 01:51:34.447
Wait. So, did I just kill everyone?

01:51:35.239 --> 01:51:37.280
Is everyone gonna die because of me?

01:51:37.405 --> 01:51:38.489
Oh, my God.

01:51:39.614 --> 01:51:41.114
Oh my... What did I do?

01:51:43.364 --> 01:51:44.697
What did I do?

01:51:48.197 --> 01:51:50.280
You know what? It's probably fine.

01:51:50.822 --> 01:51:52.905
Like I said, life doesn't make any sense...

01:51:53.072 --> 01:51:56.197
so maybe stop asking so
many questions, Scott.

01:51:56.364 --> 01:51:57.822
Stop overthinking it.

01:52:00.364 --> 01:52:02.114
Surprise!

01:52:02.322 --> 01:52:06.405
Happy Birthday to you

01:52:07.614 --> 01:52:08.905
It's not my birthday.

01:52:09.114 --> 01:52:11.655
I know. But I missed a few.

01:52:14.030 --> 01:52:15.947
This is good. We're all together.

01:52:16.322 --> 01:52:17.739
You're fine.

01:52:17.905 --> 01:52:20.822
Everything's probably fine.

01:52:20.989 --> 01:52:23.322
Kang's gone. You did it.

01:52:24.405 --> 01:52:26.239
Don't have to worry about that guy anymore.

01:52:26.405 --> 01:52:27.405
Thanks.

01:52:30.822 --> 01:52:32.822
Happy fake birthday, Cassie.

01:54:53.613 --> 01:55:01.197
Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania

01:55:10.197 --> 01:55:13.780
So, the exiled one is dead.

01:55:16.030 --> 01:55:17.988
You sure he's dead?

01:55:18.613 --> 01:55:21.447
If it wasn't true, I wouldn't call you.

01:55:22.113 --> 01:55:25.238
Must really eat you up,
that you're not the one who killed him.

01:55:25.530 --> 01:55:28.238
None of us...

01:55:29.072 --> 01:55:30.738
killed him.

01:55:33.072 --> 01:55:34.447
They did.

01:55:35.322 --> 01:55:39.905
They're beginning to touch the Multiverse.

01:55:40.572 --> 01:55:42.030
And if we let them...

01:55:42.488 --> 01:55:44.280
they will take...

01:55:45.738 --> 01:55:47.322
everything...

01:55:48.238 --> 01:55:50.280
we've built.

01:55:51.322 --> 01:55:53.863
So let's stop wasting time.

01:55:57.488 --> 01:55:58.655
We're late.

01:56:00.697 --> 01:56:03.030
How many did you call?

01:56:03.363 --> 01:56:05.780
All of us.

02:03:28.863 --> 02:03:33.821
Time is everything.

02:03:39.071 --> 02:03:42.071
It shapes our lives.

02:03:43.404 --> 02:03:47.321
But, perhaps, we can shape...

02:03:49.113 --> 02:03:50.196
it.

02:03:51.488 --> 02:03:52.613
It's him.

02:03:53.029 --> 02:03:56.363
What? You made him sound
like this terrifying figure.

02:03:57.738 --> 02:03:58.779
He is.
