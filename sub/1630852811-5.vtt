WEBVTT

00:02.000 --> 00:03.440
You just need to be less
of a wallflower.

00:03.440 --> 00:04.720
It's dog eat dog in this place.

00:04.720 --> 00:05.920
I'm working 14 hours a day and
then revising.

00:05.920 --> 00:07.600
I just feel constantly overwhelmed.

00:07.600 --> 00:09.480
Are you sure you're in the right
job?

00:09.480 --> 00:11.760
We're engaged.
We're getting married.

00:11.760 --> 00:15.040
Your girlfriend must be used to the
late nights by now, though, right?

00:15.040 --> 00:17.120
I hope you like it.
You're wearing it forever now.

00:17.120 --> 00:19.160
I thought you were going to stand me
up there.

00:19.160 --> 00:20.920
Do you mind if we rain check,
please?

00:20.920 --> 00:23.160
I hope you don't mind me asking. Why
have you made a complaint about me?

00:23.160 --> 00:25.280
I thought you said this wasn't
a disaster?

00:25.280 --> 00:28.160
"This isn't a GMC thing, we're
not going to get struck off."

00:28.160 --> 00:29.680
Erika dropped the complaint.

00:32.160 --> 00:35.400
ADAM:
Yeah, yeah, long time no speak.

00:35.400 --> 00:38.040
Five years? Don't think
it's been quite that long.

00:38.040 --> 00:40.200
Well, look, I just wanted
to let you know

00:40.200 --> 00:41.840
that it's my engagement party
tomorrow...

00:41.840 --> 00:44.120
KNOCK ON DOOR Come.

00:44.120 --> 00:47.200
Hey.  No, no, no, no, no.
You're top of the list, yeah.

00:47.200 --> 00:49.640
It's... It's been a very
last-minute thing.

00:49.640 --> 00:54.160
Oh, OK, well, look,
let's catch up in...

00:54.160 --> 00:55.640
..in another five years, yeah.

00:55.640 --> 00:58.720
HE LAUGHS Funny.

00:58.720 --> 00:59.800
OK.

01:02.120 --> 01:04.480
Erm...Mr Farrell?

01:04.480 --> 01:08.240
Yeah, sorry, er, my...my wife's
just parking.

01:08.240 --> 01:10.760
So, the blood tests didn't show up
any reason why you're struggling...

01:10.760 --> 01:14.560
Right.  ..to get pregnant.  Look,
probably nothing, but it's been

01:14.560 --> 01:18.640
stinging a little when I've,
er, peed past couple of days.

01:18.640 --> 01:21.720
Why don't you pop to the loo...

01:21.720 --> 01:22.960
..get me a sample?

01:26.440 --> 01:30.120
It's tomorrow night, erm,
it would be great to see you.

01:30.120 --> 01:33.160
Oh, and Lucy's invited too,
obviously.

01:33.160 --> 01:34.720
Oh, my God.

01:34.720 --> 01:37.240
Did they refund
the honeymoon after that?

01:37.240 --> 01:38.440
KNOCK ON DOOR

01:38.440 --> 01:42.640
Look, Artie, I have to run but
you take care of yourself, OK?

01:42.640 --> 01:43.680
Come.

01:49.920 --> 01:54.640
Right, I, erm, clearly
should've been more specific.

01:54.640 --> 01:57.920
Could you please get me
a urine sam...? Oh, shit!

02:01.680 --> 02:04.360
# Do you worry about your health?

02:04.360 --> 02:07.480
# And do you watch it slowly change?

02:07.480 --> 02:11.000
# And when you listen to yourself

02:11.000 --> 02:13.720
# Does it feel like somebody else?

02:13.720 --> 02:17.800
# And did you notice
when you began to disappear?

02:20.640 --> 02:22.560
# Was it slowly at first

02:22.560 --> 02:26.800
# Until there's nobody
really there? #

02:26.800 --> 02:29.080
Urgh!

02:30.080 --> 02:32.000
Oh!

02:32.000 --> 02:33.120
Urgh!

02:35.120 --> 02:36.360
BABY CRIES IN DISTANCE

02:42.520 --> 02:45.800
Oh, bit of early morning DIY?

02:47.640 --> 02:49.040
Something like that.

02:49.040 --> 02:52.680
Should come to ours after -
there's a flat-pack wardrobe

02:52.680 --> 02:55.160
Mick's been ignoring
for nine months.

02:55.160 --> 02:56.560
Mm-hm.

02:57.760 --> 03:00.760
Are you here four hours early
or eight hours late?

03:00.760 --> 03:03.560
Can you just say something
helpful or fuck off, please?

03:05.080 --> 03:06.840
Right you are, Doctor.

03:06.840 --> 03:08.760
Sorry, I just need to...

03:11.040 --> 03:12.560
It's my exam tomorrow.

03:12.560 --> 03:15.000
All right, sweetheart.

03:15.000 --> 03:16.920
Don't know how I'm gonna get
through it,

03:16.920 --> 03:18.040
to be honest with you.

03:19.160 --> 03:21.760
Maybe just get some sleep.

03:29.000 --> 03:31.320
HARRY:  Mum's looking forward
to seeing you again.

03:31.320 --> 03:34.160
First doctor in the family.
I mean, she's got an uncle called

03:34.160 --> 03:37.320
Dr Bones, but I think
that's just a nickname from prison.

03:39.840 --> 03:42.800
Christ.  It's our engagement party
tonight,

03:42.800 --> 03:45.160
do you wanna get a bit more engaged?

03:49.080 --> 03:50.440
I am.

03:51.760 --> 03:54.040
I am. I can't wait.

03:54.040 --> 03:57.880
I know it's mostly my lot coming,
but they're great fun.

03:57.880 --> 04:00.040
You could've invited more people.

04:00.040 --> 04:01.880
No, I've got loads of people coming.

04:01.880 --> 04:06.200
Yeah, there's Mum, Dad, Greg,
there's the uni lot,

04:06.200 --> 04:08.040
there's a few maybes, but...

04:08.040 --> 04:09.800
Will I get to meet anyone from work?

04:11.360 --> 04:13.400
Erm, they don't really...

04:13.400 --> 04:15.200
..they don't know really

04:15.200 --> 04:17.080
that I'm, um...

04:17.080 --> 04:18.760
..engaged.

04:18.760 --> 04:20.720
Oh.  Yeah.

04:20.720 --> 04:22.960
I mean, the main gang do, obviously.

04:22.960 --> 04:24.800
Yeah, they're, they're all coming.

04:24.800 --> 04:26.440
And how big's this "gang", then?

04:26.440 --> 04:28.840
We're talking the Yakuza, right,
not The Famous Five?

04:28.840 --> 04:31.080
There's Shruti and Tracy and...

04:32.960 --> 04:35.120
..Julian and, yeah, loads of people.

04:35.120 --> 04:36.720
Well, it'll be good
to meet them finally.

04:36.720 --> 04:37.920
Yeah. HE CLEARS THROAT

05:03.400 --> 05:04.640
RINGING TONE

05:05.880 --> 05:08.760
'Thank you for calling the
Medical Protection Union.

05:08.760 --> 05:11.920
'To speak to a medico-legal
adviser about a new case,

05:11.920 --> 05:13.600
'please press one.

05:13.600 --> 05:18.440
'If you have received a letter
from the GMC, please press one.

05:18.440 --> 05:20.960
'Our office hours are 9:30am...

Oh, shit.

05:25.920 --> 05:28.760
Hi, erm, I don't really know
what's going on a complaint

05:28.760 --> 05:30.320
about me was dropped, but now
I've been sent...

05:30.320 --> 05:31.480
'Press five to leave a message.'

05:31.480 --> 05:33.000
Oh. BEEP

05:45.400 --> 05:47.800
Argh! Come on! Yeah.

05:47.800 --> 05:49.480
Blocks pornography, I'm afraid.

05:49.480 --> 05:50.840
I wasn't looking up pornography.

05:50.840 --> 05:52.040
It's political correctness gone mad.

05:52.040 --> 05:54.880
I'm trying to print out some
past papers, but it's blocked

05:54.880 --> 05:57.200
the Royal College of Obstetrics
and Gynaecology website.

06:00.360 --> 06:01.760
Come on, not at work, Shruts.

06:01.760 --> 06:03.800
I really wasn't.  Ooh!

06:03.800 --> 06:06.720
That's such a nice bag,
where's that from?

06:06.720 --> 06:09.320
What do you need?  Aren't I allowed
to be just nice?

06:10.480 --> 06:13.360
Anyway, erm,
I was wondering if, erm,

06:13.360 --> 06:15.240
any of you might be free
this evening -

06:15.240 --> 06:16.360
it's my engagement party.

06:16.360 --> 06:19.040
Ooh!  You're engaged?

06:19.040 --> 06:22.440
Yeah, thought I'd do it that
way round.

06:22.440 --> 06:24.280
Pollard Road, 7pm.

06:26.240 --> 06:28.440
There's, er, free wine?

06:28.440 --> 06:29.880
What kind of wine?

06:29.880 --> 06:32.120
House?  Whose house?

06:32.120 --> 06:33.920
Tracy?

06:33.920 --> 06:37.040
Adam, darling, it's my only night
off in two weeks,

06:37.040 --> 06:38.440
and I won't be spending it with you.

06:38.440 --> 06:40.400
No offence.

06:40.400 --> 06:41.760
PAGERS BEEP

06:41.760 --> 06:43.440
No-one gonna get those?

06:46.040 --> 06:49.720
Gynae registrar on call,
senior reg, and obstetric SHO.

06:49.720 --> 06:53.640
SHRUTI:  Er, that is you, you,
and Pippa.

06:53.640 --> 06:57.120
Pippa's off sick this week,
so have fun.

06:57.120 --> 07:00.120
It would really mean a lot
to me if you could make it.

07:00.120 --> 07:01.440
Which I can't.

07:01.440 --> 07:03.800
I'll put you down as "maybe".

07:03.800 --> 07:05.760
I can do some posters if you're
that desperate for numbers.

07:05.760 --> 07:07.560
I'm not desperate for numbers.

07:07.560 --> 07:08.960
Of course you're not.

07:08.960 --> 07:11.800
Shruts?  I've got my exam tomorrow.

07:11.800 --> 07:13.920
You know, there's actually
very good evidence

07:13.920 --> 07:15.880
that people perform better
under exam conditions

07:15.880 --> 07:17.320
if they socialise the night before.

07:17.320 --> 07:20.080
Something to do with,
er, serotonin, I think.

07:21.280 --> 07:22.720
No, Adam, I can't.

07:22.720 --> 07:24.080
Come on, it's one night off.

07:24.080 --> 07:25.360
SHOUTS:  Adam, I've got my exams!

07:29.440 --> 07:32.760
Sorry. That came out louder
than expected.

07:37.320 --> 07:40.080
Shruts, have you had...have you had
a letter?

07:40.080 --> 07:41.600
Er, no.

07:41.600 --> 07:44.320
I've had another complaint
and it's a GMC one.

07:44.320 --> 07:46.240
Oh, shit. What about?

07:46.240 --> 07:48.640
My handwriting.
What do you fucking think?

07:48.640 --> 07:50.200
Why would Erika complain again?

07:50.200 --> 07:52.400
She hasn't. It's anonymous.

07:52.400 --> 07:53.560
Anonymous?

07:55.480 --> 07:57.000
Do you think I'll get one?

07:57.000 --> 07:58.560
Well, try not to be too jealous.

07:58.560 --> 08:01.840
Well, I guess you are the one
who sent her home early,

08:01.840 --> 08:03.760
and then falsified the notes.

08:03.760 --> 08:05.200
All right, Judge Judy.

08:06.200 --> 08:07.240
LIFT DINGS

08:10.000 --> 08:11.240
Thank you.

08:11.240 --> 08:13.360
Hey, how's it going?

08:13.360 --> 08:17.080
Fine.  Er, we never
rescheduled that drink,

08:17.080 --> 08:19.600
if you've got any time
in the next couple of years?

08:19.600 --> 08:21.160
Oh, I've got my exam tomorrow.

08:21.160 --> 08:22.680
Good luck.

08:22.680 --> 08:24.920
Well, after that, maybe?

08:24.920 --> 08:27.840
Um, resits.  Oh.

08:29.120 --> 08:30.720
Well, good luck with the exam.

08:30.720 --> 08:32.080
Thanks.

08:32.080 --> 08:33.600
Said that already, haven't I?

08:46.000 --> 08:47.600
Shruti!

08:47.600 --> 08:49.080
On duty!

08:53.720 --> 08:55.600
Still working here, then?

08:55.600 --> 08:58.560
Yeah, I guess so.  Knew you would.

08:58.560 --> 09:00.600
See, you've just got to
not let it get to you.

09:00.600 --> 09:02.400
Put up the old shields.

09:02.400 --> 09:03.840
Stiff upper labia, right?

09:06.720 --> 09:09.800
Yeah, exactly.  When's the exam?
Tomorrow.

09:13.880 --> 09:15.160
"True or false?

09:15.160 --> 09:17.240
"Chromaffin cells are innervated

09:17.240 --> 09:19.640
"by preganglionic sympathetic fibres

09:19.640 --> 09:21.440
"and derived from the mesoderm."

09:24.440 --> 09:25.760
Er, true.

09:25.760 --> 09:27.280
See? You'll be fine.

09:29.120 --> 09:30.480
I mean, it's false.

09:30.480 --> 09:32.600
They come from neuroectoderm,
don't they?

09:32.600 --> 09:35.080
How else are they gonna
release catecholamines?

09:36.680 --> 09:41.040
Right, if I see 100 patients
and you see 100,

09:41.040 --> 09:44.440
that's got to be, what,
quarter of 'em?

09:46.400 --> 09:48.680
# At first I was afraid

09:48.680 --> 09:50.440
'Please leave your message
after the tone.

09:50.440 --> 09:51.800
# I was petrified

09:51.800 --> 09:53.280
Oh, hello, my name's Adam Kay.

09:53.280 --> 09:54.640
I've left a couple of messages
already.

09:54.640 --> 09:56.760
# Kept thinking I could never... #
Will you shut up?

09:56.760 --> 09:58.200
Sorry, not you, obviously.

09:58.200 --> 10:00.120
# At first I was afraid

10:00.120 --> 10:02.040
My number is 07700 900 768.

10:02.040 --> 10:03.600
Hopefully speak to you soon.

10:03.600 --> 10:05.320
# I kept thinking I could never... #

10:09.560 --> 10:10.880
Layla Deacon?

10:12.200 --> 10:14.360
Hi, I'm Adam,
I'm one of the doctors here.

10:14.360 --> 10:16.920
Am I right in thinking
you've had some bleeding,

10:16.920 --> 10:19.080
and it's, erm, not like a period?

10:22.120 --> 10:24.000
Are you happy to tell me more
about it?

10:26.080 --> 10:27.520
Nothing you say goes beyond

10:27.520 --> 10:30.440
these three walls and
disgusting curtain.

10:30.440 --> 10:32.400
HE LAUGHS

10:32.400 --> 10:33.840
When did it start?

10:35.240 --> 10:36.680
How much blood is there?

10:38.240 --> 10:39.560
Has it happened before?

10:42.600 --> 10:44.760
It's like being a fucking vet.

10:44.760 --> 10:47.880
Erm, do you mind
if I have a quick look?

10:47.880 --> 10:49.680
I'll get a nurse to join us.

10:51.480 --> 10:53.760
Can I get a chaperone in here
for a second?

10:56.280 --> 10:58.920
Right. If you slip
your bottom half off,

10:58.920 --> 11:00.280
I'll be as quick as I can.

11:04.640 --> 11:07.440
Erm, feet together,
flop your knees to the side.

11:27.840 --> 11:30.440
Holy shit.  Holy shit.

11:30.440 --> 11:31.760
Sorry.

11:31.760 --> 11:35.600
Erm...Layla, will you promise
to answer me honestly

11:35.600 --> 11:38.040
if I ask you
a really difficult question?

11:40.640 --> 11:42.160
Did somebody do this to you?

11:45.760 --> 11:47.000
You promise?

11:50.880 --> 11:53.480
Was it...? Was it an accident or...?

11:53.480 --> 11:55.120
I just didn't know it would
bleed so much.

11:56.160 --> 11:57.880
Just when you think you've seen
everything,

11:57.880 --> 12:00.520
someone gives their vulva
a short back and sides.

12:00.520 --> 12:02.720
Fuck knows what I'm meant to do.

12:02.720 --> 12:06.920
Right, Sister's going to clean
you up and put a swab on

12:06.920 --> 12:08.480
to stop the bleeding.

12:08.480 --> 12:10.080
Are you in much pain?

12:10.080 --> 12:12.560
What do you think?

12:12.560 --> 12:14.760
Let's get some good-going
pain relief.

12:14.760 --> 12:17.480
We're going to look after you,
don't worry.

12:17.480 --> 12:19.320
I'm gonna speak to a colleague.

12:19.320 --> 12:21.800
I'll be back in ten minutes
to sort everything out.

12:21.800 --> 12:24.160
PHONE BUZZES How long do you think?

12:24.160 --> 12:25.280
You're gonna be fine.

12:26.880 --> 12:30.000
Mind your backs.
That's it, thank you.

12:30.000 --> 12:31.480
Hello?

12:31.480 --> 12:32.920
'Dr Kay?

12:32.920 --> 12:36.400
'It's Nina from
the Medical Protection Union.'

12:36.400 --> 12:39.160
Yes, yes, thank you so much
for calling me back.

12:39.160 --> 12:42.040
So, just listening through
your six voicemails,

12:42.040 --> 12:45.240
I think it sounds like an internal
complaint has escalated,

12:45.240 --> 12:48.000
but don't worry
because the vast majority

12:48.000 --> 12:49.200
go away on their own.

12:49.200 --> 12:51.840
They generally don't go to tribunal,
let alone become strike-off bad.

12:51.840 --> 12:53.600
OK. Great.

12:53.600 --> 12:56.720
Um, there was something
that I didn't mention.

12:56.720 --> 12:59.880
I may have written in the notes

12:59.880 --> 13:03.920
that my consultant told me
to send the patient home

13:03.920 --> 13:05.800
when he didn't exactly.

13:07.920 --> 13:09.280
Right.

13:09.280 --> 13:13.080
There was an internal hospital
complaint, which I, er...

13:14.600 --> 13:17.520
..slightly leant on the patient
to drop.

13:17.520 --> 13:18.960
I see.

13:18.960 --> 13:20.720
How worried should I be?

13:20.720 --> 13:23.840
Am I gonna lose my job?
Is it...? Is it strike-off bad?

13:23.840 --> 13:25.880
We tend not to use terms like that.

13:25.880 --> 13:28.120
You literally used that exact term.

13:28.120 --> 13:31.040
Try not to get het up, please,
Dr Kay. I'm just trying to help.

13:31.040 --> 13:34.000
Next step will be
to get you sat down

13:34.000 --> 13:35.480
with a lawyer quite urgently.

13:35.480 --> 13:38.880
Am I right to presume the patient
is the complainant again?

13:38.880 --> 13:42.040
On the letter, it says that
the complainant is anonymous.

13:42.040 --> 13:44.520
Anonymous normally suggests
it's a colleague.

13:47.880 --> 13:49.200
A colleague?

13:49.200 --> 13:51.080
It means someone you work with.

13:52.480 --> 13:53.920
Dr Kay?

13:55.040 --> 13:56.440
Dr Kay?

14:11.640 --> 14:13.280
Ah, Doctor.

14:13.280 --> 14:16.200
What's the, er...? What's the dress
code for tonight?

14:16.200 --> 14:18.520
The poster didn't say,
only I didn't, erm...

14:18.520 --> 14:21.160
Who's the consultant on call today?

14:21.160 --> 14:23.720
Mr Bignall.
It's just that Ria mentioned...

14:23.720 --> 14:25.480
I need to speak to him about
a patient.

14:25.480 --> 14:27.360
He went to labour ward
about ten minutes ago.

14:27.360 --> 14:29.600
Oh, oh. Can you quickly see
a patient for me?

14:29.600 --> 14:31.640
I'm really worried about her.

14:31.640 --> 14:36.600
She hasn't passed urine
for over 12 hours.

14:36.600 --> 14:37.840
Nor have I.

14:37.840 --> 14:39.520
Doctor?

14:39.520 --> 14:41.120
What bed's she in?

14:41.120 --> 14:42.200
Side Room Four.

14:43.200 --> 14:44.320
SHE SIGHS

14:44.320 --> 14:46.240
God, I wish there were
two of me today.

14:46.240 --> 14:47.640
No-one else does.

14:49.480 --> 14:52.960
Oi, oi, who ordered the strippagram?

14:52.960 --> 14:54.880
Who ordered the cunt?

14:54.880 --> 14:57.160
Good morning. Matilda, is it?

14:57.160 --> 14:58.280
Only on the weekends.

15:00.000 --> 15:03.320
So, apparently your catheter's

15:03.320 --> 15:05.280
not been putting out
any urine overnight.

15:05.280 --> 15:06.640
Is he taking the piss?

15:06.640 --> 15:08.480
Are you taking the piss, mate?

15:08.480 --> 15:09.960
PAGER BEEPS

15:11.560 --> 15:14.800
You drinking much?  Nah.
Cocktails in here are shit.

15:16.280 --> 15:18.600
I drank a jug of water
overnight like they told me to.

15:18.600 --> 15:20.440
Do you mind if I have
a gentle feel of your tummy?

15:20.440 --> 15:21.960
I thought you'd never ask.

15:21.960 --> 15:23.520
God, what's wrong with this prick?

15:26.440 --> 15:28.920
I didn't mean that.
I meant to say that to you.

15:28.920 --> 15:31.520
Er, sorry. MATILDA GROANS

15:32.800 --> 15:34.800
OK, your bladder's
really quite distended.

15:34.800 --> 15:36.400
I'm gonna get one of
the midwives to flush it through

15:36.400 --> 15:38.320
and, if that doesn't do
anything, we'll book in

15:38.320 --> 15:40.400
an ultrasound to check
there's nothing going on inside.

15:40.400 --> 15:42.480
Did something go wrong
at the Caesarean?

15:42.480 --> 15:43.960
It better not have done.

15:43.960 --> 15:45.280
Who's the prick now?  Rob.

15:45.280 --> 15:48.360
Well, hopefully nothing, but we just
need to, you know...

15:50.560 --> 15:52.840
Right, your catheter
tube's trapped under the wheel

15:52.840 --> 15:54.240
of your bed.

15:55.880 --> 15:57.200
MATILDA EXHALES

16:06.360 --> 16:07.920
Have you seen Mr Bignall?

16:07.920 --> 16:11.720
No.  Fuck.  Can I help?

16:11.720 --> 16:12.760
You cannot.

16:22.880 --> 16:24.960
What would you do
in this situation?

16:24.960 --> 16:26.560
So you do want my help?

16:26.560 --> 16:28.400
I've got a 19-year-old
in A&E who's...

16:30.440 --> 16:32.200
..cut her left labia half off.

16:33.400 --> 16:35.320
Oh. Shit.

16:36.920 --> 16:38.160
Abuse?

16:39.680 --> 16:41.080
Oversew the edges

16:41.080 --> 16:43.120
and do as little as you can
to stop it bleeding.

16:43.120 --> 16:44.560
And what then?

16:44.560 --> 16:45.880
See the next patient?

16:45.880 --> 16:48.600
And then probably come back
to me for help with that as well.

16:48.600 --> 16:50.560
Shouldn't I refer her to psych?

16:50.560 --> 16:53.440
Is she presenting a danger
to her own life or to others?

16:55.080 --> 16:56.760
No.  Does she need admission?

16:58.760 --> 17:01.000
No.  It sounds pretty basic.

17:02.200 --> 17:04.520
Didn't they retrain you
after your incident?

17:06.720 --> 17:09.240
It was you.
What, that cut her vulva off?

17:09.240 --> 17:12.520
You complained about me to the GMC.

17:12.520 --> 17:14.280
The GMC?

17:15.480 --> 17:17.480
I wouldn't wish that on
my worst enemy.

17:17.480 --> 17:19.320
And you're not quite there yet.

17:22.240 --> 17:24.400
Sorry, I'm just...

17:24.400 --> 17:25.680
No, I'm...

17:25.680 --> 17:28.400
I mean, I'm sorry you're having
to go through all this.

17:29.680 --> 17:32.400
Um, speak to psych about
the patient,

17:32.400 --> 17:34.040
but I wouldn't hold my breath.

17:34.040 --> 17:35.520
I know it's hard... PAGER BEEPS

17:35.520 --> 17:37.280
..but you can't let this stuff
get to you.

17:37.280 --> 17:41.080
Oh, God's sake.  At least you can
drown your sorrows later.

17:43.960 --> 17:45.600
Like it says, all welcome.

17:48.040 --> 17:49.600
Huh, I'd be delighted.

KNOCK ON DOOR

18:06.240 --> 18:10.280
SHRUTI:  So, as you know, very sadly,
that last go of IVF didn't work.

18:10.280 --> 18:13.000
And because that was your
third attempt,

18:13.000 --> 18:16.760
that means, unfortunately,
according to...

18:16.760 --> 18:19.440
We can still have another go, right?

18:19.440 --> 18:23.480
I'm... I'm very sorry to say that,
as per our guidelines,

18:23.480 --> 18:26.360
three rounds
is all you're eligible for.

18:26.360 --> 18:28.120
It can't be.

18:28.120 --> 18:29.480
I'm really sorry.

18:30.520 --> 18:33.040
Um, some...some people
try again privately,

18:33.040 --> 18:34.600
if they can find the money.

18:35.800 --> 18:38.600
MS HOUGHTON:  Roll up!
Roll up! Who's up next, then?

18:42.880 --> 18:44.360
Or you could just not bother.

18:47.240 --> 18:48.960
I'm sorry?

18:48.960 --> 18:50.240
Look, to be honest, at your age,

18:50.240 --> 18:52.680
with the number of eggs
that we've managed

18:52.680 --> 18:54.040
to harvest on your last cycles,

18:54.040 --> 18:56.800
plus the level of the AMH hormones
that you've got,

18:56.800 --> 18:59.320
you've got about a 1% chance
of success.

19:02.320 --> 19:05.480
1%?  Absolute maximum.

19:05.480 --> 19:08.880
Why's no-one told us this before?

19:08.880 --> 19:10.400
I'm telling you now.

19:14.080 --> 19:17.360
Look, why don't you go home,
regroup, think about things

19:17.360 --> 19:19.160
like egg donation, adoption?

19:19.160 --> 19:21.640
But, honestly, you're not
having a baby with IVF.

19:24.600 --> 19:27.880
Thanks, Doctor.
I appreciate your honesty.

The photos look amazing.

20:14.560 --> 20:16.520
I've put up that cute one
of you and your mum.

20:16.520 --> 20:18.320
I didn't think she showed up
in photos.

20:18.320 --> 20:20.240
Oh, I didn't tell you about
the balloons.

20:20.240 --> 20:23.880
You remember the ones you really
liked at Hannah's wedding?  No.

20:28.640 --> 20:31.240
You all right?  I just had to deal
with a teenager

20:31.240 --> 20:34.320
who cut her own labia off.
Jesus, Adam. I'm really sorry.

20:34.320 --> 20:36.520
That must have been...
I'd better go.

20:36.520 --> 20:37.880
I'll see you this evening.

20:39.680 --> 20:41.280
You're getting struck off, mate.

20:41.280 --> 20:43.560
What?  You dropped your card, mate.

21:00.280 --> 21:02.640
That sore?

21:02.640 --> 21:04.280
Much less sore than my go.

21:08.800 --> 21:10.240
Does it look OK?

21:11.560 --> 21:13.840
I've seen doctors do
worse labiaplasties,

21:13.840 --> 21:16.160
but, you know, I'm sure it
looked fine before.

21:17.880 --> 21:20.440
Other side looks...normal.

21:20.440 --> 21:22.360
Well, no, it doesn't.

21:22.360 --> 21:26.040
It looks nothing like it's meant to.

21:26.040 --> 21:30.000
Who told you what it's meant
to look like?

21:30.000 --> 21:32.080
Well, you just see it on, like...

21:34.360 --> 21:35.400
..I dunno.

21:36.720 --> 21:39.520
Don't want to make
any assumptions but...

21:40.480 --> 21:43.760
..but I've probably seen a lot
more vulvas than you have.

21:43.760 --> 21:45.280
At work, I hope.

21:50.560 --> 21:52.080
Have you, um...

21:53.880 --> 21:56.920
..talked to anyone about this?

21:56.920 --> 22:00.080
Yeah, I actually texted
everyone a picture.

22:00.080 --> 22:01.640
Oh, cool, same here.

22:09.000 --> 22:10.480
..brought a colleague over

about this stuff than I do?

Just for a quick chat?

22:18.400 --> 22:19.720
Might be helpful.

a patient for me?

23:08.400 --> 23:11.760
19 years old, just performed some
cosmetic surgery on her vulva.

There's only one of me,
I just can't.

23:22.440 --> 23:24.600
Well, what am I meant to tell her?
Tell her to see her GP

23:24.600 --> 23:26.880
for referral to community
mental health.

23:26.880 --> 23:28.400
It's just not an emergency.

23:28.400 --> 23:31.040
Since when did we only fucking see
life and death emergencies

23:31.040 --> 23:32.320

going to magic up any more doctors.

24:49.800 --> 24:51.840
MS HOUGHTON: Right, next customer!

24:54.680 --> 24:55.760
Um...

24:57.080 --> 24:59.600
..now, I can't find a heartbeat,

24:59.600 --> 25:03.200
which means that your baby
is no longer alive.

25:03.200 --> 25:05.280
Um, your options are to wait,

25:05.280 --> 25:07.640
er, see if the body passes it
naturally,

25:07.640 --> 25:11.320
we can give you some medicines
to speed things along or, er,

25:11.320 --> 25:14.360
we can book you in for an operation.
Do you understand?

25:16.280 --> 25:19.120
Er, could...could this be
a mistake?

25:19.120 --> 25:21.360
No, I'm afraid it's unmistakable.

25:21.360 --> 25:22.880
SHE SOBS UNCONTROLLABLY
I can show you

25:22.880 --> 25:24.160
the heart on the scanner

25:24.160 --> 25:26.080
if you like, but it's not moving.

25:26.080 --> 25:29.120
Um, in terms of which option
you'd like to go ahead with...

25:29.120 --> 25:31.200
SHE SOBS My baby.

25:31.200 --> 25:33.480
Well, it might be easier
not to think of it as a baby,

25:33.480 --> 25:34.960
it's just a bunch of cells.

25:36.200 --> 25:37.560
A bunch of cells?

25:39.600 --> 25:41.120
No.

25:41.120 --> 25:42.560
Sorry.

25:44.040 --> 25:46.800
Sorry, erm, that...
No, that's...that's...

25:46.800 --> 25:48.600
That's not what I meant,
that wasn't...

25:48.600 --> 25:50.880
No, we need to talk to
another doctor now!

25:54.560 --> 25:56.440
MS HOUGHTON:
Look, you're gonna get home

25:56.440 --> 25:58.480
and this afternoon's
just gonna be a big blur.

25:58.480 --> 26:00.920
All right?
So, here, take this leaflet.

26:00.920 --> 26:03.200
Right? It goes through everything
I've said.

26:03.200 --> 26:04.520
It's really good, actually.

26:04.520 --> 26:07.360
I mean, I wrote it,
so I would say it's good.

26:08.520 --> 26:10.200
Thanks so much, Doctor.

26:10.200 --> 26:13.880
Listen, there's no hurry
to make a decision, OK?

26:13.880 --> 26:16.320
You just get in touch whenever

26:16.320 --> 26:19.360
and we'll book you in
for the tablets or the operation.

26:19.360 --> 26:21.040
Actually, you know what?

26:24.160 --> 26:25.920
This is my mobile number.

26:25.920 --> 26:28.120
Give me a call directly
and I'll sort it.

26:29.720 --> 26:31.160
Thank you, Doctor.  Thanks again.

26:32.840 --> 26:36.400
And I am really sorry again
for what she said earlier.

26:36.400 --> 26:39.920
She's very junior,
but that falls absolutely miles

26:39.920 --> 26:42.520
short of what I expect
from my doctors.

26:42.520 --> 26:44.160
I'm really disappointed in her.

26:47.080 --> 26:48.160
Thank you.

26:51.000 --> 26:52.240
OK.

27:04.000 --> 27:05.560
It's all sorted.

27:05.560 --> 27:08.320
These things happen, mate.
Don't stress it.  OK.

Thank you so much for seeing her.

27:27.200 --> 27:30.400
I didn't. She discharged herself
half an hour after you left.

There's three patients
I need you to see.

Let's get you into a chair,
shall we?

28:29.280 --> 28:30.760
Can you move your arm?

28:31.800 --> 28:33.560
I think you've had a stroke.

I haven't had a stroke. I'm fine.

I just... I didn't eat my breakfast.

28:39.800 --> 28:42.080
I'll make you a wee slice
of toast, love.

28:47.000 --> 28:48.320
Keep an eye on him.

28:48.320 --> 28:50.840
I think he's had a wee stroke.

Oh, hi. HE CLEARS THROAT

29:22.520 --> 29:23.960
Oh, er, right.

29:23.960 --> 29:26.000
Er, in about an hour.

29:26.000 --> 29:27.800
OK, I will see you
at the Working Men's Club

29:27.800 --> 29:29.320
on Pollard Road for seven.

29:29.320 --> 29:31.400
You having a big pre-exams party,
or...?

29:32.760 --> 29:34.120
Is that a no?

29:34.120 --> 29:37.200
No. It's a yes, obviously.

29:43.360 --> 29:45.240
All right?  One of those days.

29:45.240 --> 29:47.440
Aren't they all? Good luck tomorrow.

29:47.440 --> 29:49.080
You'll nail it.

29:49.080 --> 29:51.640
You can wish me luck properly
at the party.

29:51.640 --> 29:53.440
Are you coming?

29:53.440 --> 29:54.760
Yeah, why not?

29:58.280 --> 30:01.360
Well, I'm not paying for your resits
if they breathalyse you.

30:03.880 --> 30:05.680
Looks like there are fewer tubes.

30:07.040 --> 30:08.880
That's got to be a good thing,
right?

30:08.880 --> 30:10.680
Unless one's fallen out -
that would be...

30:12.680 --> 30:14.080
..that would be a bad thing.

30:15.840 --> 30:17.240
Anyway, hopefully, you'll...

30:19.280 --> 30:21.480
..you'll be out of here
before too long.

30:23.720 --> 30:26.600
As it turns out, I'll probably
beat you out of here...

30:27.920 --> 30:29.120
..because some total...

30:30.920 --> 30:32.080
..colleague...

30:33.600 --> 30:35.240
..is trying to get me struck off.

30:36.400 --> 30:38.760
I give my life to this shithole
and this is...

30:40.520 --> 30:41.560
HE SIGHS

30:45.400 --> 30:47.240
You don't think I deserve it,
do you?

30:51.960 --> 30:55.640
I'm sorry Emma can't make it
tonight, she just...

30:55.640 --> 30:57.200
Didn't wanna come?

30:57.200 --> 30:59.280
No, it's not that.

30:59.280 --> 31:01.920
Well, yeah, it is that, slightly.

31:01.920 --> 31:03.720
So, have you sorted a date, then?

31:03.720 --> 31:06.000
Make sure it doesn't clash
with my wedding.

31:06.000 --> 31:07.680
Of course, I'll need you there.

31:07.680 --> 31:10.480
How do you fancy being my best man?

31:10.480 --> 31:12.440
Oh, wow.

31:12.440 --> 31:14.520
That's really kind.

31:14.520 --> 31:16.320
So kind.

31:17.560 --> 31:19.080
Properly kind.

31:19.080 --> 31:21.960
Don't feel like you have to.
I don't feel like I have to.

31:21.960 --> 31:24.040
Obviously, I would, but... PARTY MUSIC

31:24.040 --> 31:27.240
This feels very much like a no.
No, I just...

31:27.240 --> 31:29.280
I wasn't gonna do this today,
clearly.

31:29.280 --> 31:31.320
What, you shat yourself
in the IMAX again?

31:31.320 --> 31:32.960
No, I've...I've been thinking.

31:34.280 --> 31:36.560
I'm going to have
to relieve you of best man duties.

31:39.240 --> 31:44.240
Right, you're demoting me
to just man?

31:44.240 --> 31:46.000
Not just man.

31:46.000 --> 31:47.440
You're a man who I love.

31:49.800 --> 31:52.480
But I need the day to run smoothly,
and I know what your job's like.

31:53.680 --> 31:55.000
I always get there in the end.

31:55.000 --> 31:56.440
You always get there at the end.

31:56.440 --> 31:58.720
Look, and if there's some
big emergency,

31:58.720 --> 32:00.720
are you honestly telling me
you'd leave it behind?

32:04.160 --> 32:05.280
Course you wouldn't.

32:17.440 --> 32:19.600
There you are.

32:19.600 --> 32:23.120
Hey.  Adam tells me you organised
this all by yourself.

32:23.120 --> 32:25.440
Extraordinary.  Ah.

32:25.440 --> 32:28.720
Thank you. Adam was too busy
saving babies.

32:28.720 --> 32:31.840
Expect you'll get used
to doing things on your own.

32:31.840 --> 32:33.280
I will?

32:33.280 --> 32:34.600
You'll have to.

32:34.600 --> 32:36.560
You'll think it's just
a junior doctor thing,

32:36.560 --> 32:38.840
but it gets worse and worse,
believe me.

32:38.840 --> 32:43.120
Still, marriage is all about taking
someone on as they are, isn't it?

32:43.120 --> 32:45.200
Which of us is perfect?

32:46.760 --> 32:50.360
I, for example, have eczema.

32:50.360 --> 32:52.200
He's perfect for me.

32:54.000 --> 32:56.280
That's all that matters,
really, isn't it?

33:08.000 --> 33:09.240
Look who it is.

33:12.720 --> 33:14.440
You all right?  Yeah.

33:14.440 --> 33:16.080
I'm fine.  You sure?

33:18.200 --> 33:19.840
No, I'm not.

33:19.840 --> 33:22.200
Greg's just dumped me
as his best man,

33:22.200 --> 33:24.480
and there's been a complaint
about me, a bad one,

33:24.480 --> 33:27.680
to the GMC, and a baby's very ill,

33:27.680 --> 33:29.040
and I lied in the notes

33:29.040 --> 33:31.120
and I really don't know
what's gonna happen.

33:31.120 --> 33:32.600
What the fuck, Adam?

33:32.600 --> 33:35.680
It'll be fine.
They're getting me a lawyer.

33:35.680 --> 33:36.960
How could you let that happen?

33:36.960 --> 33:38.800
I thought you were good at your job.

33:38.800 --> 33:40.880
That's exactly why I didn't tell
you.

33:40.880 --> 33:43.200
You're just an embarrassment,
aren't you?  Shut up!

33:43.200 --> 33:45.760
Adam?  Sorry, I was miles away.

33:45.760 --> 33:48.920
Erm, yep, I'm...I'm fine, thanks.

33:50.560 --> 33:53.000
Relax.  Mm-hm.  It's gonna be fun.

33:53.000 --> 33:55.240
It is fun.
Everyone's having a nice time.

33:55.240 --> 33:56.640
Everyone?  Yep.

33:56.640 --> 33:58.840
Your mum's had a glass of wine.

33:58.840 --> 34:00.920
We found her one made
of actual glass.

34:00.920 --> 34:02.400
Oh, fancy.

34:02.400 --> 34:05.000
Then she did a quick DJ set,
mostly ambient house,

34:05.000 --> 34:07.200
but she chucked in a bit
of hard NRG.

34:07.200 --> 34:10.000
BOTH LAUGH
OK, it was more ghetto house.

34:11.400 --> 34:13.320
Does your dad ever talk?

34:13.320 --> 34:16.280
Yeah, sometimes, it just takes
him a few hours to power up.

34:16.280 --> 34:17.520
Like a beard trimmer.

34:19.880 --> 34:21.520
Oh, I was just talking to Pawel,
what an angel.

34:21.520 --> 34:24.640
Pawel?  Yeah, one of your work
friends, a porter, I think?

34:24.640 --> 34:28.920
Yes, sorry, er, we tend to use
nicknames at work.

34:28.920 --> 34:30.880
Oh, yeah, what is it, then?

34:30.880 --> 34:33.640
Pav? Pav... Pavpav.

34:33.640 --> 34:35.520
Wow, creative.

34:35.520 --> 34:37.200
Right, come say hi to Mum.

34:37.200 --> 34:39.120
She's already started a conga line.

34:39.120 --> 34:41.200
I'm gonna just get a quick drink.

34:41.200 --> 34:43.160
Yeah.  I'll be...

34:43.160 --> 34:46.120
Hello!  Hey! LAUGHTER

34:46.120 --> 34:48.480
Thanks so much for coming, guys.

34:48.480 --> 34:51.120
It's all right. It's the first
night out we've had in years.

34:51.120 --> 34:53.600
We dragged her along.
She never gets out.

34:53.600 --> 34:56.160
Didn't wanna miss out
on any gossip, more like.

34:56.160 --> 34:58.600
Hmm!  Ah!

34:58.600 --> 35:01.560
And also for the free booze,
obviously.  Slainte.

35:01.560 --> 35:02.680
Yeah, thanks.

35:02.680 --> 35:04.520
Hey, Harry's great, fair play.

35:04.520 --> 35:07.040
If I was 20 years younger,
and he was single...

35:08.200 --> 35:11.360
..and straight.  Quite a few barriers
there, really, Trace.

35:11.360 --> 35:12.840
You should mention
the gay thing at work.

35:12.840 --> 35:14.360
People might warm to you more.

35:17.320 --> 35:19.320
OK, catch you...catch you later.

35:21.280 --> 35:24.560
A glass of your least shit
white wine, please.

35:24.560 --> 35:27.160
This is charming.

35:27.160 --> 35:29.960
So much carpet.

35:29.960 --> 35:32.680
It's good of you to have it
in a place like this,

35:32.680 --> 35:35.320
avoids Harry and his friends
feeling out of place.

35:37.880 --> 35:39.040
How are you, Dad?

35:40.640 --> 35:43.080
Traffic OK?
Took us an age to get here.

35:43.080 --> 35:46.920
And to think people actually come
to this part of town voluntarily!

35:46.920 --> 35:49.240
Well, Harry's mum's come
all the way from Ireland.

35:49.240 --> 35:52.160
Mmm, only sausage rolls waiting
at the end of her journey.

35:53.320 --> 35:56.000
Still, it's probably what
they eat there.

35:56.000 --> 35:59.040
Harry subjected me to her earlier.

35:59.040 --> 36:00.960
Fun, isn't she?

36:09.920 --> 36:12.240
Oh, hang on, lost soul
to retrieve, two secs.

36:13.280 --> 36:14.640
Hey. Welcome.

36:14.640 --> 36:17.960
Hey, mate. I'm looking
for the groom or the bride.

36:17.960 --> 36:22.280
You found her straight away.
Hey, I'm Harry, Adam's fiance.

36:23.560 --> 36:25.720
Course. Sorry, I didn't, erm...

36:25.720 --> 36:28.480
I didn't, but now you mention it.

36:28.480 --> 36:29.960
Er, terrific to meet you.

36:29.960 --> 36:33.440
I'm Julian,
one of Adam's work, um, people.

36:33.440 --> 36:35.360
I love your coat.  Ah, cheers.

36:35.360 --> 36:38.080
No-one makes a trench
quite like Burberry, do they?

36:38.080 --> 36:40.120
I'd have guessed that you were gay.

36:41.840 --> 36:43.120
So, tell me, do you...?

36:43.120 --> 36:45.680
Oh, I'm so sorry,
I just have a work...

36:45.680 --> 36:47.400
..a work thing, just very...

36:48.600 --> 36:50.280
Erm, Harry doesn't know.

36:50.280 --> 36:53.320
That you're gay?
Hey, you really ought to tell him.

36:53.320 --> 36:54.840
No, about the GMC complaint.

36:54.840 --> 36:57.960
You didn't mention that, did you?
No, no, no, course not.

36:57.960 --> 37:01.000
Look, if you ever wanna talk
about the GMC thing, I'm...

37:02.280 --> 37:04.280
This is for you. A little something.

37:04.280 --> 37:07.520
Oh, erm... That's very kind.
Thank you.

37:09.480 --> 37:11.280
Gin and tonic for you.

37:11.280 --> 37:13.680
Thank you.  Soda water.

37:13.680 --> 37:15.960
Cos you know what they say
about surgeons?

37:15.960 --> 37:18.600
That they shouldn't get pissed
on a weekday?

37:18.600 --> 37:20.920
No, we're good with our hands.

37:20.920 --> 37:22.560
Er... HE LAUGHS

37:27.320 --> 37:29.240
Ohh!  Shall we find you a cab?

37:31.080 --> 37:33.280
You're the one who keeps
asking me for a drink.

37:33.280 --> 37:36.160
Come on. Up.

37:37.480 --> 37:39.520
BEN CHUCKLES

37:39.520 --> 37:42.800
Adam... Adam.
Adam, have you met Ben?

37:42.800 --> 37:45.520
Yeah. You work up on neo-natal
ward, don't you?

37:45.520 --> 37:47.680
Oh, yeah, of course, he hates you.

37:47.680 --> 37:50.200
What? No. I don't...I don't hate
you, I...

37:50.200 --> 37:52.080
I'm joking. I'm joking.

37:52.080 --> 37:54.720
I guess... I guess
other people hate you more.

37:55.960 --> 37:57.240
WHISPERS:  GMC.

37:58.240 --> 37:59.760
Oh, my God...

38:01.200 --> 38:02.640
It was you.

38:02.640 --> 38:05.680
Oh, come on, like you've never been
sick in an ashtray.

38:05.680 --> 38:06.880
How could you?

38:08.560 --> 38:11.720
After everything we've been through,
everything I've...  What?

38:13.440 --> 38:15.120
What do you mean?  What do I mean?

38:15.120 --> 38:18.360
Putting in a fucking complaint
about me.

38:18.360 --> 38:20.200
Everyone having fun?

38:20.200 --> 38:22.360
Yeah, Shruti's having a great time

38:22.360 --> 38:24.280
trying to get me struck off
the register.

38:24.280 --> 38:27.080
Adam, now's probably not the time.
Mm. You're quite right.

38:27.080 --> 38:28.760
What should we do, then, Shruti?

38:28.760 --> 38:30.360
Should we put something
in the, uh, diary?

38:30.360 --> 38:33.160
Yeah, should we do it before
or after I lose my fucking job?

38:33.160 --> 38:34.720
Don't embarrass yourself.

38:34.720 --> 38:36.720
I knew you were a terrible doctor.

38:36.720 --> 38:39.200
I didn't know that you're a terrible
person as well.

38:39.200 --> 38:41.800
Probably, I should be impressed that
you managed to fill

38:41.800 --> 38:46.200
in the fucking form.  Stop it.
She didn't do it. Spare me. I did.

38:49.000 --> 38:50.800
Yeah, I shouldn't have come.

38:54.920 --> 38:56.520
Adam, you wanna say hi to Mum?

38:56.520 --> 38:57.640
Not particularly.

39:00.280 --> 39:01.640
He's so funny.

39:03.040 --> 39:04.960
He doesn't mean it.

39:04.960 --> 39:06.720
He's been having a
hard time recently.

39:06.720 --> 39:09.480
Sorry, I'm Shruti, I work with him.

39:09.480 --> 39:11.360
Is this about
that old lady that died?

39:11.360 --> 39:13.360
No, err, the complaint's come back.

39:13.360 --> 39:15.960
Yeah, he's gonna get struck off,
probably.

39:15.960 --> 39:18.040
Sorry, you don't have
an ashtray, do you?

39:28.800 --> 39:30.400
I thought you were on my side.

39:30.400 --> 39:32.800
D'you know whose side I'm on, Adam?

39:32.800 --> 39:34.360
The patients'.

39:34.360 --> 39:37.200
Not yours, not anybody else's.
The patients'.

39:37.200 --> 39:38.920
So am I.

39:38.920 --> 39:40.320
Really?  Yes.

39:40.320 --> 39:42.080
You refused to call your consultant,

39:42.080 --> 39:44.560
even though you knew you were
out of your depth with Erika.

39:44.560 --> 39:47.240
How could I let that go unnoticed?

39:47.240 --> 39:48.560
Easily!

39:48.560 --> 39:50.160
This is my career,

39:50.160 --> 39:53.000
not a playground
for your personal vendettas.

39:53.000 --> 39:54.840
This isn't personal!

39:54.840 --> 39:58.640
You assaulted your patients,
that's what that is.

39:58.640 --> 40:01.720
If you cut someone's tattoo -
assault.

40:01.720 --> 40:04.640
Taking personal phone calls
during deliveries?

40:04.640 --> 40:06.960
And disconnecting
the emergency alarms?

40:06.960 --> 40:08.480
You're a liability.

40:08.480 --> 40:10.240
And what about bullying Erika

40:10.240 --> 40:12.680
into dropping
her perfectly valid complaint?

40:12.680 --> 40:16.520
That was the cherry on the top
of the whole cake of shit.

40:16.520 --> 40:19.640
It's...
It's pride and it's dishonesty,

40:19.640 --> 40:22.120
it's arrogance and it's entitlement.

40:23.400 --> 40:26.760
You think that you are
the cleverest person in the room.

40:26.760 --> 40:28.680
And that makes you dangerous.

40:29.960 --> 40:32.560
How can I trust you
with my patients?

40:34.120 --> 40:35.960
You didn't leave me with any choice.

40:48.960 --> 40:50.560
What's your address, Shruts?

40:50.560 --> 40:52.040
For God's sake.

40:52.040 --> 40:54.200
Do you wanna try leaving me
alone for five minutes?

40:55.280 --> 40:56.400
Get your leg in there.

40:56.400 --> 40:58.240
Not gonna be sick, is she?
She'll be all right, mate.

40:58.240 --> 40:59.520
Here's your bag, love.

41:04.520 --> 41:06.520
LOUD CHATTER

41:31.400 --> 41:33.680
BEEPING

41:37.920 --> 41:41.400
There he is. I thought
you'd gone back to work.

41:41.400 --> 41:43.200
Ladies and gentlemen,

41:43.200 --> 41:44.760
I'm sure you can all agree

41:44.760 --> 41:48.480
that Adam and Harry
are totally made for each other.

41:48.480 --> 41:50.200
CROWD:  Hear, hear!

41:50.200 --> 41:52.040
Why don't we hand over to Adam,

41:52.040 --> 41:54.080
who I'm sure wants to say
a few words?

41:54.080 --> 41:57.080
I really don't!  In which case,
I'll just carry on

41:57.080 --> 42:00.720
and tell the story of the time
Adam vomjaculated.

42:00.720 --> 42:02.440
GROANING

42:02.440 --> 42:03.560
For those of you not in the know,

42:03.560 --> 42:05.600
vomjaculation is...  OK.

42:05.600 --> 42:07.720
CHEERING

42:16.880 --> 42:18.800
Well, I'll be really quick.

42:31.480 --> 42:33.600
I don't know why it's me
doing this speech,

42:33.600 --> 42:35.040
I know about four of you.

42:35.040 --> 42:37.360
Anyway, um...

42:37.360 --> 42:40.680
When I first met Harry
in a shit bar...

42:42.440 --> 42:43.640
..um, who'd have...

42:48.000 --> 42:49.840
..who would have thought
that, two years later,

42:49.840 --> 42:52.640
I'd be standing here
in a somehow worse bar?

42:52.640 --> 42:54.280
TRICKLE OF LAUGHTER

42:57.840 --> 43:00.920
But Harry is, err, very, erm...

43:06.200 --> 43:07.840
..kind and...

43:07.840 --> 43:09.280
HE SIGHS

43:10.200 --> 43:11.680
..tolerant.

43:13.880 --> 43:16.560
I was going to say that, err,

43:16.560 --> 43:19.080
my relationship's
the only thing in my life

43:19.080 --> 43:20.600
that's not totally fucked up.

43:24.000 --> 43:25.600
But now I'm not quite sure...

43:26.960 --> 43:28.400
..how true that is.

43:33.200 --> 43:36.040
Anyway, erm, nice to meet you.

43:37.720 --> 43:38.920
Cheers.

43:53.080 --> 43:55.920
You just gonna sit there
in silence, then?

43:55.920 --> 43:57.520
What d'you want me to say?

44:00.560 --> 44:02.360
Sorry for humiliating me?

44:05.240 --> 44:07.000
Sorry for lying to me for months?

44:10.400 --> 44:12.960
Sorry for what you said
to my poor mum?

44:12.960 --> 44:14.800
Been writing minutes, have you?

44:21.800 --> 44:23.560
I put in so much effort, Adam.

44:23.560 --> 44:26.200
It was a couple of balloons
and a big cardboard H.

44:30.120 --> 44:31.320
I...

44:33.280 --> 44:35.320
..never complain
about a single thing that you do.

44:35.320 --> 44:38.000
What's this, then?
Adam, please, just...

44:39.320 --> 44:40.400
You don't...

44:42.920 --> 44:45.440
..give anything back,
you lie and lie and lie.

44:47.480 --> 44:48.720
You're so shut off.

44:49.880 --> 44:51.440
HE SIGHS

44:58.560 --> 44:59.960
How we gonna make this work?

45:05.840 --> 45:07.560
Well, we're probably not, are we?

45:11.720 --> 45:13.240
It's the next road on the left.

45:25.920 --> 45:31.040
# Don't hold on

45:31.040 --> 45:36.800
# Go get strong

45:36.800 --> 45:39.680
# Well, don't you know

45:41.200 --> 45:43.280
# There's no

45:43.280 --> 45:47.360
# Modern romance. #
