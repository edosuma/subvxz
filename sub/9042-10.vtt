WEBVTT

00:02.133 --> 00:03.967
- CAN WE GO WATCH TV UPSTAIRS?

00:03.967 --> 00:06.000
- YEAH, JUST FOR A LITTLE WHILE.

00:06.000 --> 00:09.300
- AH, THAT WAS
SUCH A WONDERFUL NIGHT.

00:09.300 --> 00:10.667
- WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL?

00:10.667 --> 00:11.900
IT WAS JUST DINNER

00:11.900 --> 00:14.067
AND YOU PEOPLE.

00:14.067 --> 00:18.467
- I'M TALKING ABOUT ROBERT'S
WONDERFUL ANNOUNCEMENT.

00:18.467 --> 00:21.500
I AM SO HAPPY
YOU'RE BACK WITH AMY.

00:21.500 --> 00:23.300
- A WONDERFUL ANNOUNCEMENT
WOULD HAVE BEEN,

00:23.300 --> 00:25.667
"I'M PICKING UP THE CHECK."

00:25.667 --> 00:27.733
- AND GUESS WHAT.

00:27.733 --> 00:29.633
AMY'S COMING
TO THANKSGIVING TOO.

00:29.633 --> 00:31.600
- OH.
- THAT'S IN TWO DAYS.

00:31.600 --> 00:35.433
ARE YOU SURE YOU CAN
STAY TOGETHER THAT LONG?

00:35.433 --> 00:37.033
- ZING, ZING, ZING.
HUH, CUBBY?

00:37.033 --> 00:38.833
[laughs]

00:38.833 --> 00:41.200
- WELL, MAYBE WE SHOULD GO.
IT'S GETTING KIND OF LATE.

00:41.200 --> 00:42.267
WHAT TIME IS IT, MARIE?

00:42.267 --> 00:43.800
- WHAT'S THE TIME?

00:43.800 --> 00:45.967
IT'S, UM...

00:45.967 --> 00:49.167
UM...UH...

00:49.167 --> 00:51.867
TIME FOR DESSERT!

00:51.867 --> 00:53.633
IT'S SUCH A WONDERFUL NIGHT.

00:53.633 --> 00:55.933
- ALL RIGHT, DESSERT.
- ALL RIGHT.

00:55.933 --> 00:57.400
LET'S DO THAT.

00:58.933 --> 01:00.233
WOW.
DID YOU SEE THAT?

01:00.233 --> 01:02.500
- YEAH, IT'S GETTING REALLY BAD.

01:02.500 --> 01:04.067
- I THINK
IT'S WORSE THAN EVER.

01:04.067 --> 01:05.567
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

01:05.567 --> 01:06.867
- FRANK, DIDN'T YOU SEE MARIE

01:06.867 --> 01:08.200
HAVING TROUBLE WITH THE CLOCK?

01:08.200 --> 01:09.800
- WELL, TIME HAS NEVER BEEN

01:09.800 --> 01:11.333
A FRIEND TO MARIE.

01:13.367 --> 01:15.333
- SHE WAS SQUINTING
BECAUSE SHE COULDN'T SEE IT.

01:15.333 --> 01:17.133
SAME THING WAS HAPPENING
AT THE RESTAURANT.

01:17.133 --> 01:18.600
- YEAH, YEAH, I KNOW.

01:18.600 --> 01:20.467
DID YOU SEE HER STRAINING
TO READ THE SPECIALS?

01:20.467 --> 01:24.233
- WAS THAT BEFORE OR AFTER
SHE WALKED INTO THE MEN'S ROOM?

01:25.767 --> 01:27.500
- MA'S BLIND.

01:29.367 --> 01:31.200
- SHE'S NOT BLIND, ROBERT.

01:31.200 --> 01:32.967
WE JUST HAVE TO TELL HER
SHE NEEDS GLASSES.

01:32.967 --> 01:35.333
- OH, YEAH, RIGHT.
- OH, YEAH, THAT'S GONNA HAPPEN.

01:35.333 --> 01:36.900
- WHY?
WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL?

01:36.900 --> 01:38.700
- NOW, I DON'T KNOW
IF YOU'VE NOTICED, DEBRA,

01:38.700 --> 01:40.667
BUT MA'S PRETTY SENSITIVE
ABOUT HER APPEARANCE.

01:40.667 --> 01:42.367
- YEAH, BUT YOUR MOM'S
NOT SO SILLY

01:42.367 --> 01:44.033
THAT SHE'S GONNA PUT VANITY
BEFORE HER SIGHT.

01:44.033 --> 01:45.433
[both laughing]

01:45.433 --> 01:47.133
- YEAH, YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU'RE RIGHT, DEB.

01:47.133 --> 01:48.767
YOU SHOULD TELL HER
SHE NEEDS GLASSES.

01:48.767 --> 01:50.700
- YEAH.
- [chuckling]

01:50.700 --> 01:54.967
- YOU MIGHT WANT TO PUT
YOUR AFFAIRS IN ORDER FIRST.

01:54.967 --> 01:56.667
- WHY DON'T YOU
TELL HER, FRANK?

01:56.667 --> 01:58.100
- AH, NOT ME.

01:58.100 --> 01:59.833
LAST TIME
I TOLD HER TO DO SOMETHING

01:59.833 --> 02:01.167
FOR HER OWN GOOD,

02:01.167 --> 02:04.033
IT COMPLETELY BIT ME
IN THE ASS.

02:04.033 --> 02:07.600
- WHAT WAS THAT?
- I SAID, "MARRY ME."

02:11.667 --> 02:13.967
- HERE WE GO, EVERYBODY.
TIRAMISU.

02:13.967 --> 02:16.333
- OH, TIRAMISU ME!
- OOH!

02:17.433 --> 02:20.200
- THERE'S SOME FOR THAT GUY.

02:20.200 --> 02:22.700
ALL RIGHT.
- UM, MARIE...

02:22.700 --> 02:25.033
CAN I ASK YOU SOMETHING?

02:25.033 --> 02:26.500
- HEY, CAN I ASK YOU SOMETHING?

02:26.500 --> 02:29.133
HOW COME THERE'S NO TIRAMISU
IN YOUR MOUTH?

02:31.167 --> 02:33.933
- MARIE, UM...

02:33.933 --> 02:36.500
WHEN'S THE LAST TIME
YOU SAW AN OPTOMETRIST?

02:51.200 --> 02:53.933
UH, YOU KNOW,
BECAUSE WE WERE, UH, TALKING,

02:53.933 --> 02:55.567
AND, UM, WE THOUGHT

02:55.567 --> 02:58.133
MAYBE YOU SHOULD
LOOK INTO GETTING SOME GLASSES.

02:58.133 --> 03:00.067
- MY EYES ARE FINE.

03:00.067 --> 03:03.333
- WELL, WE COULDN'T HELP
BUT NOTICE

03:03.333 --> 03:06.700
THAT YOU'RE HAVING
A LITTLE TROUBLE SEEING.

03:08.367 --> 03:11.867
- WELL, LET ME TELL YOU
THAT MY VISION IS PERFECT.

03:11.867 --> 03:13.233
TELL THEM, FRANK.

03:17.133 --> 03:18.333
FRANK?

03:20.800 --> 03:24.233
- OH, I WAS HOPING
YOU COULDN'T SEE ME.

03:32.000 --> 03:35.367
- MARIE, WHAT'S THE HARM IN JUST
GETTING YOUR EYES CHECKED?

03:35.367 --> 03:36.900
- I AM NOT WEARING GLASSES.

03:36.900 --> 03:39.600
- OKAY, CONTACT LENSES, THEN.
WHAT IS THE BIG DEAL?

03:39.600 --> 03:43.100
- I'M--I'M NOT GONNA
STICK THOSE THINGS IN MY EYES.

03:43.100 --> 03:46.333
AND I DON'T LIKE
HOW I LOOK IN GLASSES.

03:46.333 --> 03:48.000
- BUT IF YOU'RE
HAVING TROUBLE SEEING,

03:48.000 --> 03:50.800
ISN'T CORRECTING THAT MORE
IMPORTANT THAN ANYTHING ELSE?

03:50.800 --> 03:52.033
- YOU KNOW ME, DEBRA.

03:52.033 --> 03:54.067
I'M NOT A VAIN WOMAN.

03:55.367 --> 03:56.533
AND I'VE BEEN TOLD

03:56.533 --> 03:59.800
THAT I HAVE
A BOTTICELLI FACE.

03:59.800 --> 04:04.467
AND ONE DOES NOT PUT GLASSES
ON A BOTTICELLI FACE.

04:04.467 --> 04:08.133
- I'D SAY YOU HAVE MORE
OF A "MR. POTATO HEAD" FACE.

04:10.367 --> 04:13.367
AND GLASSES COME WITH THE KIT.

04:14.400 --> 04:15.833
- I AM NOT GETTING GLASSES,

04:15.833 --> 04:17.767
AND WE'RE NOT
TALKING ABOUT THIS ANYMORE.

04:17.767 --> 04:18.867
JUST EAT YOUR DESSERT.

04:18.867 --> 04:20.167
- OKAY.

04:22.067 --> 04:23.200
EW.

04:23.200 --> 04:24.433
MY FORK IS DIRTY.
- WHAT?

04:24.433 --> 04:26.767
THERE ARE NO DIRTY FORKS
IN MY HOUSE.

04:26.767 --> 04:28.067
LET ME SEE.

04:30.600 --> 04:32.700
OH, MY GOD.

04:32.700 --> 04:33.933
- WHAT, MA?

04:33.933 --> 04:37.000
- I WASHED THIS FORK MYSELF

04:37.000 --> 04:38.533
BY HAND.

04:40.633 --> 04:42.400
I GUESS I MISSED IT.

04:51.333 --> 04:53.733
- LET'S HIDE.

04:58.833 --> 05:01.767
[cheering on TV]

05:06.533 --> 05:09.833
- IT'S OKAY.
I GOT IT.

05:09.833 --> 05:11.833
- OH.
OH, YOU GOT IT.

05:11.833 --> 05:15.200
'CAUSE YOU'RE
A SEXY MUSCLE GIRL.

05:20.000 --> 05:22.100
- I JUST CAME
FROM THE EYE DOCTOR,

05:22.100 --> 05:24.000
AND I WANT
TO SHOW YOU SOMETHING.

05:25.433 --> 05:26.667
TA-DA!

05:30.633 --> 05:31.767
- OH!

05:31.767 --> 05:32.867
- WHAT DO YOU THINK?

05:32.867 --> 05:34.267
- YOU DID IT, MA!

05:34.267 --> 05:35.767
- YEAH, THE DOCTOR SAID

05:35.767 --> 05:38.667
I REALLY ONLY NEED TO USE THEM
FOR READING AND DRIVING,

05:38.667 --> 05:40.467
BUT THERE WERE
SOME PEOPLE IN THE SHOP

05:40.467 --> 05:43.133
WHO SAID THAT I LOOK
SO SOPHISTICATED IN THEM,

05:43.133 --> 05:45.933
I MIGHT LEAVE THEM ON
ALL THE TIME.

05:45.933 --> 05:50.400
- THAT'S THE, UH, THE STYLE
THE KIDS ARE WEARING NOW?

05:51.900 --> 05:53.767
- RAY...
THEY LOOK GREAT, MARIE!

05:53.767 --> 05:55.500
- YEAH, NO, THEY LOOK GOOD.
THEY LOOK GOOD.

05:55.500 --> 05:57.900
- OH, WOW.
WHAT DID FRANK SAY?

05:57.900 --> 05:59.233
- NOTHING.

05:59.233 --> 06:00.600
HE WOULDN'T NOTICE
ANYTHING NEW ON ME

06:00.600 --> 06:02.500
UNLESS IT WAS MADE
OF SAUSAGE.

06:08.467 --> 06:10.367
BUT I'LL TELL YA,
ON THE DRIVE HOME,

06:10.367 --> 06:12.067
IT WAS AS IF I WAS
SEEING THE NEIGHBORHOOD

06:12.067 --> 06:13.267
FOR THE FIRST TIME.

06:13.267 --> 06:14.467
- THAT'S GREAT, MA.

06:14.467 --> 06:16.067
- OH, MARIE,
WE ARE SO PROUD OF YOU!

06:16.067 --> 06:18.500
- OH, ISN'T IT WONDERFUL?

06:18.500 --> 06:19.667
- YES.

06:19.667 --> 06:22.900
- OH, LOOK.
YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE I CAN SEE?

06:22.900 --> 06:26.200
THERE'S A COBWEB FORMING
UNDER THE TELEVISION.

06:30.100 --> 06:32.433
- WOW, THAT IS JUST--
THAT IS GREAT!

06:32.433 --> 06:35.367
THAT'S AMAZING.
MARIE, THAT'S TERRIFIC.

06:35.367 --> 06:37.133
- I MEAN,
I CAN SEE THE WORLD!

06:37.133 --> 06:41.433
EVERYTHING IS
A LITTLE MORE CLEAR AND VIVID.

06:41.433 --> 06:43.600
OH, WHAT'S THAT?
- WHAT?

06:43.600 --> 06:46.100
- OH, NOTHING.
IT'S JUST AN EYELASH.

06:46.100 --> 06:47.367
- OH, WOW.

06:47.367 --> 06:49.300
THOSE ARE HIGH-POWERED, MA.

06:51.067 --> 06:52.433
- MAKE A WISH.

06:53.700 --> 06:54.967
[laughs]

06:54.967 --> 06:56.900
- OH.

06:56.900 --> 06:58.567
- WHAT?

06:58.567 --> 06:59.700
- OH, NOTHING.

06:59.700 --> 07:02.167
I JUST NEVER NOTICED
YOUR EYELASHES.

07:02.167 --> 07:03.633
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

07:03.633 --> 07:06.800
- I--I ALWAYS THOUGHT
THEY WERE A LITTLE FULLER.

07:06.800 --> 07:08.467
OH, DON'T TOUCH.

07:08.467 --> 07:10.467
YOU WANT TO KEEP
THE ONES YOU HAVE.

07:14.933 --> 07:17.133
WELL, ALL RIGHT.
I BETTER BE GOING.

07:17.133 --> 07:18.133
GOOD-BYE, DEAR.

07:18.133 --> 07:19.233
- OKAY. BYE-BYE.

07:19.233 --> 07:21.233
- OH, AND I'LL TELL YOU

07:21.233 --> 07:23.467
ANOTHER GREAT THING
ABOUT THESE NEW GLASSES.

07:23.467 --> 07:27.533
THEY LET ME SEE
JUST HOW HANDSOME YOU ARE.

07:27.533 --> 07:28.533
- THANKS, MA.

07:28.533 --> 07:30.700
MAYBE I SHOULD
GET DEBRA A PAIR.

07:33.100 --> 07:35.033
- AND I LOVE
THAT LITTLE TOUCH OF GRAY

07:35.033 --> 07:36.767
YOU'RE GETTING
AROUND THE SIDES.

07:36.767 --> 07:39.733
VERY DISTINGUISHED.

07:39.733 --> 07:41.633
- WHAT?
- I GOT TO GO.

07:41.633 --> 07:45.167
OH, AND DEBRA,
THANK YOU FOR THESE.

07:45.167 --> 07:46.900
I'M GONNA SHOW THESE
TO ROBBIE.

07:46.900 --> 07:50.367
OH, I CAN'T WAIT
FOR THANKSGIVING TOMORROW.

07:54.800 --> 07:55.800
- ISN'T THAT GREAT?

07:55.800 --> 07:56.833
YOUR MOM CAN SEE.

07:56.833 --> 07:58.333
- YEAH, I KNOW.

07:58.333 --> 08:00.700
IT'S LIKE A BLESSING.

08:00.700 --> 08:02.400
- OH, ONE MORE THING.

08:02.400 --> 08:03.867
I WAS WONDERING
IF I COULD MAKE

08:03.867 --> 08:05.367
A PUMPKIN BUNDT CAKE TOMORROW.

08:05.367 --> 08:07.400
- OKAY. OKAY, SURE.
- YEAH, THAT WOULD BE GREAT.

08:07.400 --> 08:08.467
SO WE'LL SEE YOU TOMORROW.

08:08.467 --> 08:11.733
- AND I'LL SEE YOU TOMORROW.

08:48.567 --> 08:50.300
- HEY.

08:52.000 --> 08:54.067
HOW'S IT GOING?

08:55.300 --> 08:57.000
- WHAT DID YOU DO
TO YOUR HAIR?

08:57.000 --> 08:58.433
- NOTHING.

08:58.433 --> 09:00.300
WHAT'S WITH YOUR EYES?

09:02.833 --> 09:04.200
- NEVER MIND.

09:04.200 --> 09:05.967
NO, WHAT IS UP
WITH YOUR SIDEBURNS?

09:05.967 --> 09:07.267
- NOTHING.

09:07.267 --> 09:09.000
DID A LITTLE TOUCH-UP.
THAT'S ALL.

09:09.000 --> 09:10.133
- TOUCH-UP?
WHAT IS--

09:10.133 --> 09:11.333
- NOTHING!

09:11.333 --> 09:13.100
WHY? WHAT?
IS IT NOTICEABLE?

09:13.100 --> 09:14.900
- NO, NOT AT ALL,

09:14.900 --> 09:16.567
ELVIS.

09:18.300 --> 09:20.733
- HA HA HA.
LOOK AT YOU.

09:20.733 --> 09:22.900
- THIS IS NOT
THE SAME THING AT ALL.

09:22.900 --> 09:24.433
IT'S A HOLIDAY.

09:24.433 --> 09:27.033
- OH, SO WHAT ARE YOU,
THE THANKSGIVING DAY HOOKER?

09:31.833 --> 09:33.933
- THIS IS NOT HOOKER, RAY.

09:33.933 --> 09:35.333
THIS IS WHAT WOMEN DO

09:35.333 --> 09:38.133
WHEN THEY DON'T HAVE
THE THICKEST EYELASHES.

09:38.133 --> 09:39.700
YOU JUST DON'T ALWAYS
SEE ME LIKE THIS

09:39.700 --> 09:42.800
BECAUSE I'M NOT SOMEONE
WHO CARES ABOUT THESE THINGS.

09:42.800 --> 09:47.067
- BOY, I'D HATE TO SEE THE EYES
OF SOMEBODY WHO DOES CARE.

09:47.067 --> 09:48.600
- YOU'RE THE ONE WHO CARES.

09:48.600 --> 09:50.600
LOOK WHAT YOU DID
TO YOUR HEAD.

09:50.600 --> 09:52.733
I HAD NO IDEA
YOU WERE SO VAIN.

09:52.733 --> 09:53.900
- ME, VAIN?

09:53.900 --> 09:56.167
YOU'RE A RACCOON
TALKING TO ME!

09:58.033 --> 09:59.800
- HELLO, EVERYBODY.

09:59.800 --> 10:01.867
HAPPY THANKSGIVING!

10:01.867 --> 10:03.267
- HEY, AMY.
- OH!

10:09.633 --> 10:11.000
- HI, ROBERT.

10:11.000 --> 10:13.400
- HEY, E'RYDUDDY.

10:14.767 --> 10:18.233
WHERE DO YOU WANT ME
TO HUT THIS CRANDERRY SAUCE?

10:19.267 --> 10:21.133
- WHAT DID YOU SAY?

10:21.133 --> 10:23.333
- CRANDERRY SAUCE.

10:24.700 --> 10:26.667
IT'S HANTASTIC!

10:27.867 --> 10:30.867
- "HANTASTIC"?

10:30.867 --> 10:33.733
WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED TO YOU?

10:33.733 --> 10:35.133
- OH, YEAH, YEAH.

10:35.133 --> 10:37.033
I WENT TO THE DENTIST.

10:37.033 --> 10:39.400
SO HOW IS E'RYDUDDY?

10:41.200 --> 10:44.567
CAN'T WAIT HOR THE TURKEY.

10:45.967 --> 10:47.733
- ROBERT.

10:47.733 --> 10:49.200
- WHAT?

10:49.200 --> 10:51.133
- ROBERT HAD A PROCEDURE.

10:51.133 --> 10:52.800
- AMY, COME ON!

10:52.800 --> 10:57.667
- ROBERT, DID YOU HAVE
THOSE ANTI-WRINKLE INJECTIONS

10:57.667 --> 10:59.067
PUT IN YOUR FACE?

11:00.933 --> 11:02.367
- TERHATS.

11:09.000 --> 11:12.233
- "TURD HATS"?

11:16.700 --> 11:19.233
- YOUR MOTHER NOTICED
A FEW WRINKLES ON HIM,

11:19.233 --> 11:21.767
SO HE GOES TO SOME DOCTOR

12:34.133 --> 12:36.700
- OH, THANK YOU.

12:36.700 --> 12:38.267
YOU DON'T WANT TO BE
ONE OF THOSE WOMEN

12:38.267 --> 12:40.333
THAT GETS ALL THAT WORK DONE.

12:45.800 --> 12:47.867
- HI, NA.

12:47.867 --> 12:49.867
- ROBERT?

12:49.867 --> 12:51.333

12:51.333 --> 12:53.333

12:53.333 --> 12:55.367
HAHHY TURKEY DAY!

12:56.600 --> 12:58.867
- TELL HER WHAT YOU DID

12:58.867 --> 13:00.700
- HY DON'T YOU?

13:00.700 --> 13:02.100
- I DON'T DO ANYTHING.

13:02.100 --> 13:04.033
- TOUCH HIS HAIR, NA!
TOUCH HIS HAIR, NA!

13:04.033 --> 13:05.233
- YEAH, BUT LOOK AT HIS FACE!

13:05.233 --> 13:06.700

STOP IT, YOU TWO.

13:06.700 --> 13:09.467
THIS IS A HOLIDAY.

13:11.500 --> 13:13.267
RAYMOND.

13:13.267 --> 13:14.967
YOU LOOK SO NICE.

13:14.967 --> 13:16.267
- THANK YOU.

13:19.200 --> 13:20.667
- IS THIS SHOE POLISH?

13:22.367 --> 13:24.467
- ONLY IF YOU PUT IT
ON A SHOE.

13:26.167 --> 13:28.767
THAT'S NOT THE POINT.
YOU SAID I LOOKED NICE.

13:28.767 --> 13:30.033
AND I DO.

13:30.033 --> 13:32.100
I LOOK NICE,
AND I FEEL NICE.

13:32.100 --> 13:33.333
THAT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT THING,

13:33.333 --> 13:36.033
THAT YOU FEEL GOOD
ABOUT YOURSELF.

13:36.033 --> 13:39.400
- I HEEL GREAT ADOUT NYSEL.

13:43.167 --> 13:44.267
- ROBBIE,

13:44.267 --> 13:46.300

13:46.300 --> 13:48.033
IT'S ANNOYING.

13:48.033 --> 13:49.333
- HE CAN'T STOP, MA,

13:49.333 --> 13:51.367
'CAUSE HE PUT INJECTIONS
IN HIS FACE.

13:51.367 --> 13:52.167
- WHAT?

13:52.167 --> 13:53.733
- RAYNOND!

13:55.300 --> 13:57.700
WHO ARE YOU TO SAY THAT?

13:57.700 --> 14:02.067
WHAT I DO HITH NY HACE
IS NY DUSINESS!

14:02.067 --> 14:05.767
- ROBERT!
- NO! I'N REALLY TISSED!

14:13.200 --> 14:14.233
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

14:14.233 --> 14:16.500
WHY WOULD YOU DO SUCH A THING?

14:18.400 --> 14:19.733
- NY?

14:24.733 --> 14:27.767
DECAUSE O' YOU.

14:27.767 --> 14:29.500
YOU'RE THE UN WHO SAID

14:29.500 --> 14:33.600
YOU CAN SEE ALL THE WRINKLES
IN NY HACE.

14:34.967 --> 14:37.300
- I LIKE THOSE LINES.

14:37.300 --> 14:39.300
THAT'S CHARACTER.

14:39.300 --> 14:42.000
NOW YOU LOOK LIKE A TOTEM POLE.

14:42.000 --> 14:44.767
- [laughs]

14:44.767 --> 14:45.867
- HERE, LET ME TRANSLATE.

14:45.867 --> 14:48.367
TOTEM TOLE.

15:03.467 --> 15:05.367
- RAYMOND.

15:05.367 --> 15:07.567
DID YOU PUT THAT STUFF
IN YOUR HAIR

15:07.567 --> 15:09.600
JUST BECAUSE OF SOMETHING
I SAID?

15:09.600 --> 15:12.733
ABOUT HOW I LIKE
THE TOUCH OF SILVER ON THE SIDE?

15:14.800 --> 15:17.100
- I DON'T LIKE THE SILVER.

15:17.100 --> 15:20.900
- OH, RAYMOND.

15:20.900 --> 15:23.067
NO MATTER HOW OLD YOU GET,

15:23.067 --> 15:26.233
YOU'RE STILL GONNA BE MY BOY.

15:26.233 --> 15:27.500
AND, DEBRA...

15:27.500 --> 15:28.433
COULD YOU--

15:39.000 --> 15:40.733
OH, MY.

15:42.067 --> 15:45.600
- YOU SAID I HAD
SKIMPY EYELASHES.

15:45.600 --> 15:47.467
- OH, HONEY.

15:47.467 --> 15:49.933
I DIDN'T MEAN ANYTHING
BY THAT.

15:49.933 --> 15:51.933
YOU HAVE SUCH PRETTY EYES.

15:51.933 --> 15:54.967
I'VE ALWAYS SAID
THAT THAT'S YOUR BEST FEATURE.

15:54.967 --> 15:56.433
HAVEN'T I, FRANK?

15:56.433 --> 15:58.633
- YOU'VE SAID PLENTY.

15:59.967 --> 16:02.633
- BUT I ALSO HAVE TO SAY

16:02.633 --> 16:05.333
THAT I AM SO FLATTERED

16:05.333 --> 16:09.067
THAT JUST BECAUSE I MADE
A COUPLE OF LITTLE OBSERVATIONS,

16:09.067 --> 16:12.700
THAT MY KIDS
ARE WILLING TO CHANGE THINGS

16:12.700 --> 16:14.633
JUST TO PLEASE ME.

16:14.633 --> 16:18.667
- OR MAYBE IT'S EASIER TO CHANGE
THAN TO HAVE TO LISTEN TO YOU.

16:23.767 --> 16:25.933
- REALLY, FRANK?

16:25.933 --> 16:27.200
THAT'S FUNNY
COMING FROM YOU,

16:27.200 --> 16:29.133
BECAUSE YOU DON'T DO EITHER.

16:30.833 --> 16:32.467
FRANK?

16:34.067 --> 16:35.167
HEY!

16:35.167 --> 16:36.633
- ALL RIGHT.
YOU KNOW WHAT?

16:36.633 --> 16:38.633
LET'S NOT DO THIS TODAY.
IT'S THANKSGIVING.

16:38.633 --> 16:39.433
- THAT'S RIGHT.

16:39.433 --> 16:40.533
IT'S THANKSGIVING,

16:40.533 --> 16:41.900
AND I'M THANKFUL FOR FOOTBALL.

16:41.900 --> 16:43.033
GIVE ME THAT REMOTE, LADY!

16:43.033 --> 16:44.300
- WOULD YOU LIKE TO HEAR

16:44.300 --> 16:45.600
WHAT I NOW NOTICE
ABOUT YOU, FRANK?

16:45.600 --> 16:46.667
- OH, BOY.

16:46.667 --> 16:48.767
- YEAH, YEAH.
I'M FAT AND BALD.

16:48.767 --> 16:50.200
THE REMOTE.

16:53.800 --> 16:56.067
- THAT'S NOT
WHAT I WAS GOING TO SAY.

16:56.067 --> 16:57.533
I DON'T CARE ABOUT LOOKS.

16:57.533 --> 17:00.633
I'M WITH YOU,
AREN'T I?

17:00.633 --> 17:03.667
I'M TALKING
ABOUT WHAT'S INSIDE, FRANK.

17:03.667 --> 17:04.867
- OH, GEEZ.

17:04.867 --> 17:06.033
- THAT'S RIGHT.

17:06.033 --> 17:08.233
THE TOTAL LACK OF COMMUNICATION.

17:08.233 --> 17:11.067
THE TOTAL DISREGARD
FOR ME AS A HUMAN BEING.

17:11.067 --> 17:13.400
IT'S BEEN THIS WAY
FOR 45 YEARS.

17:13.400 --> 17:15.800
I MEAN, GOD FORBID YOU SHOULD
PAY ANY ATTENTION TO ME

17:15.800 --> 17:18.367
OR SHOW ME EVEN
IN THE SLIGHTEST POSSIBLE WAY

17:18.367 --> 17:20.700
THAT YOU HAVE ANY FEELINGS
FOR ME AT ALL.

17:20.700 --> 17:22.300
- WELL, THEN,
IF I'M SO TERRIBLE,

17:22.300 --> 17:24.133
WHY DO YOU STICK AROUND?

17:25.900 --> 17:27.133
- MAYBE I WON'T.

17:27.133 --> 17:28.233
- OH, YEAH?

17:28.233 --> 17:30.433
- MAYBE I WON'T, FRANK,

17:30.433 --> 17:33.900
NOW THAT I SEE
I'M IN A LOVELESS MARRIAGE.

17:33.900 --> 17:36.100
- A LOVELESS MARRIAGE?

17:37.033 --> 17:39.167
A LOVELESS MARRIAGE?

17:39.167 --> 17:41.333
A LOVELESS
MARRIAGE?

18:04.500 --> 18:07.100
- NODUDDY THINKS
I LOOK YOUNGER?

18:32.033 --> 18:34.733
- AT LEAST
PUT SOME BUTTER ON THAT.

18:34.733 --> 18:35.733
- NO.

18:35.733 --> 18:37.667
- SOME JELLY?

18:37.667 --> 18:38.633
- NO.

18:38.633 --> 18:41.233
- MUSTARD.
I GOT BROWN MUSTARD.

18:41.233 --> 18:44.200
- I LIKE IT DRY.

18:44.200 --> 18:45.533
- WELL, HAVE SOME MILK
OR SOMETHING,

18:45.533 --> 18:47.233
'CAUSE YOU'RE GONNA
CHOKE TO DEATH.

18:47.233 --> 18:50.000
- WHAT DO YOU CARE?

18:51.600 --> 18:54.267
- IS THAT WHY
YOU BROKE MY NEW GLASSES?

18:54.267 --> 18:57.500
BECAUSE I SAID WE HAVE
A LOVELESS MARRIAGE?

18:58.967 --> 19:00.867
- YOU GONNA KEEP SAYING IT?

19:00.867 --> 19:04.433
- IT BOTHERS YOU WHEN I DO,
DOESN'T IT?

19:09.067 --> 19:11.667
I DIDN'T MEAN IT.

19:11.667 --> 19:16.033
YOU KNOW I JUST GET
A LITTLE OVERDRAMATIC SOMETIMES.

19:20.400 --> 19:23.900
BUT LOOK
HOW EVERYBODY REACTED

19:23.900 --> 19:26.333
JUST BECAUSE OF SOMETHING
I SAID.

19:26.333 --> 19:28.767
IT MADE ME FEEL IMPORTANT.

19:28.767 --> 19:32.667
AND I HAVE NEVER SEEN YOU
REACT SO STRONGLY

19:32.667 --> 19:34.367
ABOUT ANYTHING I SAID.

19:36.733 --> 19:38.533
YOU'RE A PIG.

19:38.533 --> 19:40.733
YOU DON'T TALK.
YOU DON'T LISTEN.

19:43.300 --> 19:46.667
BUT YOU LOVE ME, FRANK.

19:49.433 --> 19:51.367
FRANK?

19:55.533 --> 19:58.167
- YOU DON'T NEED GLASSES
FOR THAT.

20:00.500 --> 20:03.133
- OH, FRANK.

20:03.133 --> 20:06.033
YOU LOVE YOUR LITTLE RUM BALL.

20:10.200 --> 20:11.600
- WE GOT ANY MEAT
FOR A SANDWICH?

20:11.600 --> 20:14.033
- YEAH, I GOT
HARD SALAMI.

20:14.033 --> 20:16.033
- AND I'LL TAKE SOME JUICE.
- OKAY.

20:16.033 --> 20:18.233
AND, OH,
I GOT THE BROWN MUSTARD.

20:18.233 --> 20:19.633
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?

20:19.633 --> 20:22.267
I--I THINK MAYBE I'LL JUST
WEAR THE GLASSES

20:22.267 --> 20:26.233
FOR READING AND DRIVING
LIKE THE DOCTOR SAID.

20:26.233 --> 20:27.367
WAIT A MINUTE.
WAIT A MINUTE.

20:27.367 --> 20:29.067
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

20:29.067 --> 20:30.667
IT'S THANKSGIVING!

20:30.667 --> 20:31.667
- SO?

20:31.667 --> 20:32.667
- SO?

20:32.667 --> 20:33.933
EVERYBODY'S OVER THERE--

20:33.933 --> 20:35.533
THE KIDS, AMY--

20:35.533 --> 20:37.567
A-AND DEBRA COOKED
ALL THAT FOOD.

20:41.033 --> 20:43.133
YOU'RE RIGHT.
WE'LL EAT FIRST.

20:51.367 --> 20:52.633
- OKAY.

20:52.633 --> 20:55.200
SO YOU REALLY THINK
MY EYES LOOK OKAY THIS WAY?

20:55.200 --> 20:56.667
WITHOUT ALL THAT STUFF ON THEM?

20:59.167 --> 21:01.400
- ALL RIGHT,
LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING.

21:01.400 --> 21:04.300
I HAVE ALWAYS THOUGHT
YOUR EYES ARE BEAUTIFUL.

21:06.000 --> 21:07.767
- THAT'S VERY SWEET.

21:07.767 --> 21:10.167
BUT I WANT YOU
TO ANSWER THE QUESTION AGAIN

21:10.167 --> 21:12.367
AND BEAR IN MIND
THAT I AM WAY TOO TIRED

21:12.367 --> 21:14.267
TO HAVE SEX TONIGHT.

21:16.733 --> 21:18.700
- WHAT DOES THAT GOT TO DO
WITH ANYTHING?

21:18.700 --> 21:20.200
I LOVE YOUR EYES.

21:20.200 --> 21:21.500
- NO, I MEAN IT, RAY.

21:21.500 --> 21:23.267
IT'S REALLY NOT
GONNA HAPPEN TONIGHT.

21:23.267 --> 21:25.133
- ALL RIGHT.
WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO SAY?

21:25.133 --> 21:27.100
GIVE ME A BREAK.
I MEAN, THIS IS RIDICULOUS.

21:27.100 --> 21:29.400
YOUR EYES WERE THE FIRST THING
I NOTICED WHEN I MET YOU,

21:29.400 --> 21:31.600
SO WHY WOULD I WANT
ANYTHING DIFFERENT?

21:31.600 --> 21:34.067
- ARE YOU TRYING
TO HAVE SEX WITH ME?

21:34.067 --> 21:36.700
- I AM.

21:36.700 --> 21:39.033
- GOOD NIGHT, RAY.

21:39.033 --> 21:40.567
- ALL RIGHT,
YOU KNOW WHAT?

21:40.567 --> 21:42.367
I WISH I COULD SAY
THAT I DON'T LIKE YOUR EYES,

21:42.367 --> 21:47.000
BUT SEX OR NO SEX,
YOUR EYES ARE BEAUTIFUL.

21:48.033 --> 21:49.767
SO SWEET DREAMS.

21:49.767 --> 21:50.767
- STILL TRYING?

21:50.767 --> 21:51.700
- YEAH!

21:54.400 --> 21:55.467
COME ON!
