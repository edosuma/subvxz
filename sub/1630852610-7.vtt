00:01.610 --> 00:02.741
<i>Previously on</i>

00:02.785 --> 00:04.265
<i>"Relatively Famous:</i> <i>
Ranch Rules"...</i>

00:04.308 --> 00:06.180
<i>We've got an actual</i> <i>
cattle drive planned.</i>

00:06.223 --> 00:07.616
<i>We run a tight ship</i> <i>
over here.</i>

00:07.659 --> 00:10.010
- I think we're on track.
- Hell yeah.

00:10.053 --> 00:11.489
- Uh-oh.
- Hey, Austin.

00:11.533 --> 00:12.751
Aren't we going the wrong way?

00:12.795 --> 00:14.057
They're definitely
going the wrong way.

00:14.101 --> 00:15.406
<i>This is Austin's fault.</i>

00:15.450 --> 00:18.322
<i>He positions himself</i> <i>
in front of these cows</i>

00:18.366 --> 00:19.758
so they try to go
the other way.

00:19.802 --> 00:20.803
Harry, push a little bit.

00:20.846 --> 00:22.370
Get them going
down to the right.

00:22.413 --> 00:25.068
You explaining how to do it,
like, I know what I'm doing.

00:25.112 --> 00:26.635
- Go to the right.
- Shut up.

00:26.678 --> 00:28.463
- Yup.
- Uh-oh.

00:28.506 --> 00:30.595
- What's wrong?
- You okay?

00:30.639 --> 00:32.902
I can't kick
with this leg though--my knee.

00:32.945 --> 00:34.947
Oh, no.

00:34.991 --> 00:37.646
This is miserable.
I'm in pain.

00:37.689 --> 00:39.343
This is a yee-naw.

00:39.387 --> 00:42.564
Who would choose to do this
for fun?

00:42.607 --> 00:44.522
<i>I've gone glamping,</i> <i>
but I've never been camping.</i>

00:44.566 --> 00:47.047
It sounds disgusting,
dirty, and nasty.

00:47.090 --> 00:49.136
- Thanks, Austin.
- Of course.

00:49.179 --> 00:50.441
I have four bites on me
right now.

00:50.485 --> 00:52.661
It's itching so bad.

00:54.706 --> 00:55.838
Yo, we need a lot more.

00:57.927 --> 00:59.972
<i>I'm already exhausted,</i> <i>
physically exhausted,</i>

01:00.016 --> 01:02.671
mentally exhausted.
- Austin, is it almost ready?

01:03.889 --> 01:04.977
I'm not cooking you anything.

01:05.021 --> 01:06.153
Why?
I'm hungry.

01:06.196 --> 01:07.415
I'm not your mother.

01:07.458 --> 01:08.416
Well, at home
you act like my mother.

01:08.459 --> 01:09.982
Not anymore.
Absolutely not.

01:10.026 --> 01:11.288
So why all of a sudden are
you being a asshole?

01:11.332 --> 01:12.942
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
don't touch me.

01:12.985 --> 01:14.465
Relax, relax.

01:14.509 --> 01:15.945
- Get your hand--
- Okay.

01:15.988 --> 01:17.773
- off my arm.
- Back the up.

01:17.816 --> 01:18.948
I'm hungry.

01:18.991 --> 01:20.210
I'm not cooking you dinner.

01:20.254 --> 01:22.343
Go do it yourself.
- Don't spit in my face.

01:22.386 --> 01:25.607
Then back the up
before I you up.

01:25.650 --> 01:27.870
<i>- You don't scare me, bro.</i> <i>
- Let's go, then.</i>

01:27.913 --> 01:29.001
<i>I'm trying to make you</i> <i>
feel better about--</i>

01:29.045 --> 01:30.307
<i>Let's go.</i>

01:30.351 --> 01:31.700
- I don't need to go.
- It's as simple as that.

01:31.743 --> 01:33.136
I've been respectful
this whole time.

01:33.180 --> 01:34.398
If you keep pushing--

01:34.442 --> 01:35.530
Why are you being
so, like, emotional?

01:35.573 --> 01:37.880
It's just ridiculous. Relax.

01:37.923 --> 01:39.969
<i>After this long day,</i> <i>
this is what we're gonna do?</i>

01:40.012 --> 01:42.841
Like, I'm trying to just chill,
you know, relax.

01:42.885 --> 01:45.583
<i>And now Harry's trying to</i> <i>
bully Austin for a hot dog.</i>

01:45.627 --> 01:47.150
Y'all gonna
do this now?

01:47.194 --> 01:48.717
You're not taking my dinner.

01:48.760 --> 01:50.414
I don't need
your stupid-ass dinner.

01:50.458 --> 01:52.416
I was just asking why
you don't want to share.

01:52.460 --> 01:53.591
<i>You have no problem cooking</i>

01:53.635 --> 01:55.115
<i>for me any other day</i> <i>
of the week.</i>

01:55.158 --> 01:57.073
And then now you're saying
that you're not gonna cook?

01:57.117 --> 01:59.119
Now I'm the asshole.
What did I do?

01:59.162 --> 02:00.207
Like, what the [bleep]?

02:00.250 --> 02:01.643
Harry, chill.

02:01.686 --> 02:03.558
That's fine, dawg.
That's fine.

02:03.601 --> 02:04.602
Make your own dinner
and, like, chill.

02:04.646 --> 02:06.300
I wasn't talking to you. Sorry.

02:06.343 --> 02:08.519
You're acting like a weirdo
right now.

02:08.563 --> 02:11.174
So, like, chill out and
make yourself your own dinner.

02:14.786 --> 02:17.485
You have to understand,
there's nothing weird...

02:17.528 --> 02:18.790
It's kind of weird.

02:18.834 --> 02:20.792
You're asking a grown man
to make your dinner.

02:20.836 --> 02:22.751
I just don't like how
he likes to be the star--

02:22.794 --> 02:24.056
I don't think
he's doing that.

02:24.100 --> 02:25.319
But I don't think
he's trying to do that.

02:25.362 --> 02:26.537
He is, he is.
He is fake as

02:26.581 --> 02:27.930
He is.

02:27.973 --> 02:29.888
I think he actually wanted
to go get firewood.

02:30.541 --> 02:32.369
Look at Austin right now.
Look at Austin.

02:32.413 --> 02:34.371
No, don't look at him.
I think we should all

02:34.415 --> 02:36.330
ignore him because
he wants to be looked at.

02:36.373 --> 02:38.723
He takes on a project
as if it's his own

02:38.767 --> 02:41.770
'cause he needs to be
the one who's doing everything.

02:41.813 --> 02:43.467
Like, I need him to tell me
how to do anything.

02:43.511 --> 02:44.860
So maybe you should
tell him that?

02:44.903 --> 02:45.904
Austin.

02:47.254 --> 02:48.733
Explain how you feel.
- Okay.

02:48.777 --> 02:51.083
The whole time
we were riding today,

02:51.127 --> 02:52.911
you're saying,
"get on the side."

02:52.955 --> 02:55.262
"Do this."
- Harry, hold your position.

02:55.305 --> 02:56.872
Don't spook 'em.
Harry, don't run with them.

02:56.915 --> 02:58.003
Just go a little wider.

02:58.047 --> 02:59.396
I know, I'm just trying
to get wide.

02:59.440 --> 03:01.790
You're not my boss.
Like, we're the same thing.

03:01.833 --> 03:03.357
We went through
the same training.

03:04.445 --> 03:06.795
Harry and Austin
start fighting again.

03:06.838 --> 03:08.275
<i>I'm just over it.</i>

03:08.318 --> 03:10.146
If there's a problem, Harry,
you should just be like,

03:10.190 --> 03:11.191
yo, Austin,
shut the up.

03:11.234 --> 03:12.322
Exactly.

03:12.366 --> 03:13.715
I was getting firewood
for myself.

03:13.758 --> 03:15.717
Not for you,
not to be the big guy.

03:15.760 --> 03:18.023
<i>Harry likes to push buttons</i> <i>
with Austin.</i>

03:18.067 --> 03:19.764
And I think Harry really wants

03:19.808 --> 03:21.940
to see Austin get
to that breaking point.

03:21.984 --> 03:23.333
It's so annoying.

03:23.377 --> 03:24.813
You take my seat,
you come over here,

03:24.856 --> 03:26.989
ask for my dinner,
I said "no" three times.

03:27.032 --> 03:28.512
Are you stupid?

03:31.428 --> 03:33.343
You talk about respect,
I have a lot of respect

03:33.387 --> 03:34.736
and I don't want
to embarrass you...

03:34.779 --> 03:37.129
You think
I'm embarrassed by you?

03:37.173 --> 03:39.349
You're embarrassed every time
I show you up.

03:39.393 --> 03:41.873
Let me just undo
all your work real quick.

03:43.919 --> 03:47.183
Nothing you do out here
embarrasses me.

03:47.227 --> 03:49.098
I'm Gucci, dawg.

03:49.141 --> 03:51.187
You guys know I overachieve.
You guys know I go out--

03:51.231 --> 03:52.319
Yeah, you do.

03:52.362 --> 03:53.320
And do
for the group.

03:53.363 --> 03:54.451
Yeah, you do overachieve.

03:54.495 --> 03:55.713
Because I know
it wouldn't get done.

03:55.757 --> 03:57.193
This wouldn't get done
without you.

03:57.237 --> 03:58.325
Don't get all pumped up
while you're talking to me.

03:58.368 --> 03:59.369
Exactly.
You keep talking to me

03:59.413 --> 04:00.805
like that,
I will you up.

04:00.849 --> 04:03.112
I guarantee that, mother

04:03.155 --> 04:04.548
Oh, I'm so scared.

04:04.592 --> 04:06.463
You keep talking
a big game.

04:06.507 --> 04:08.335
Come over here and say it
to my face.

04:08.378 --> 04:09.727
I just said it to your face

04:09.771 --> 04:11.033
and you're the one
who walked away.

04:11.076 --> 04:12.861
Nah, you're sitting down
like a bitch, boy.

04:13.992 --> 04:15.255
Shut the up.

04:16.430 --> 04:19.694
- Austin.
- Just give me a second.

04:19.737 --> 04:21.304
He's gonna go on a walk
in the sunset.

04:21.348 --> 04:24.220
Guess we won't be telling
campfire stories

04:24.264 --> 04:26.091
and "Kumbaya-ing?"

04:26.135 --> 04:27.484
Where you going?

04:27.528 --> 04:30.095
Something bit me on my arm
and it itches so bad.

04:30.139 --> 04:31.923
It's horrible.

04:31.967 --> 04:34.317
Hey, everybody,
I heard a bunch of yelling.

04:34.361 --> 04:35.971
Is everything okay up here?

04:39.453 --> 04:40.889
How are you doing?

04:40.932 --> 04:42.847
Horrible.
I hate everything.

04:42.891 --> 04:45.415
I'm, like, about ready
to go home.

04:45.459 --> 04:47.330
I, like, I'm trying to,
like, stick it out

04:47.374 --> 04:48.897
for this grand opening but...

04:48.940 --> 04:50.855
Come here.
Let's go for a little walk.

04:50.899 --> 04:52.204
Yeah.

04:52.248 --> 04:54.294
I've only been camping,
like, twice in my life

04:54.337 --> 04:55.860
and it was so many years ago.

04:55.904 --> 04:58.559
So I didn't even pack extra
stuff like I normally would.

04:58.602 --> 05:02.302
And like, with all these bugs,
it's just a lot.

05:02.345 --> 05:04.434
You want to sit down?

05:11.441 --> 05:14.531
Did you have a chance
to look at the cows

05:14.575 --> 05:17.099
and the horses
when the sun was hitting?

05:17.142 --> 05:18.840
I didn't even look back.

05:20.407 --> 05:22.104
I just got so frustrated.

05:22.147 --> 05:24.324
They all got drama
and it's weird stuff going on.

05:24.367 --> 05:26.935
I could barely breathe here.

05:26.978 --> 05:28.371
Everything's just wrong.

05:28.415 --> 05:30.591
I have been pushing through,
like, a lot of stuff,

05:30.634 --> 05:31.809
but I feel like I'm, like,

05:31.853 --> 05:33.942
reaching my breaking point
at this point.

05:35.465 --> 05:40.035
I think everybody is kind of
reaching their breaking point.

05:41.689 --> 05:44.431
- I'm just tired.
- I know you are.

05:47.129 --> 05:48.913
But you have a strength in you

05:48.957 --> 05:53.396
that sometimes it frustrates me
that you don't tap it.

05:53.440 --> 05:56.268
Like, I know I'm strong and
I came here just to kind of,

05:56.312 --> 05:59.837
you know, have fun, experience
all these different things

05:59.881 --> 06:02.057
on the ranch, and
it's just draining, you know?

06:02.100 --> 06:03.319
Yeah.

06:04.320 --> 06:07.497
You try really hard and
I know that you're sensitive

06:07.541 --> 06:10.021
to a lot of the stuff
that goes on, you know.

06:10.065 --> 06:13.634
And that kind of stuff
affects me physically too.

06:13.677 --> 06:15.505
I watch Ebie a lot.

06:15.549 --> 06:17.942
And, um, I can kind of relate

06:17.986 --> 06:20.815
<i>to some of the things</i> <i>
that's going on with her.</i>

06:20.858 --> 06:23.034
And I just want to let her know
that she's not alone.

06:23.078 --> 06:26.908
Sometimes, Ebie, I feel like
packing up and going home too.

06:26.951 --> 06:31.042
Every day I try to find
some kind of gratitude.

06:31.086 --> 06:32.522
Yeah.

06:32.566 --> 06:34.655
Sometimes it's just
a breadcrumb.

06:43.881 --> 06:46.057
I spent a lot of time
with my mom back at home.

06:46.101 --> 06:48.930
Like, that's my best friend.
She's like the Kris to my Kim.

06:48.973 --> 06:52.063
I'm having a bad day. <i>
- Well, it's hard, you know.</i>

06:57.634 --> 06:59.027
Anne has kind of, like,

06:59.070 --> 07:00.594
<i>taken my mom's place</i> <i>
here on the ranch</i>

07:00.637 --> 07:01.943
<i>and it literally feels like</i>

07:01.986 --> 07:03.597
<i>she's one of</i> <i>
my family members.</i>

07:03.640 --> 07:06.948
You know, we kind of just
connect on a personal level.

07:19.395 --> 07:21.745
Fire's actually
kind of nice.

07:21.789 --> 07:22.964
A few more drinks,

07:23.007 --> 07:24.705
I'ma be sleeping
in that tent.

07:24.748 --> 07:27.664
And you guys will just
have to carry on without me.

07:29.840 --> 07:33.235
At the end of the day,
I still love you,

07:33.278 --> 07:36.717
but just, I--
I'm just voicing my opinion.

07:36.760 --> 07:40.068
I feel disrespected.
That's all.

07:41.809 --> 07:43.506
Can I just say,
can I just say--

07:43.550 --> 07:44.768
- Before we get into it--
- Yeah, no, no.

07:44.812 --> 07:46.074
I'm just letting
you know that.

07:46.117 --> 07:48.685
I would never hit you.
I don't want to do that.

07:48.729 --> 07:49.643
- Yeah.
- And I would never do that.

07:49.686 --> 07:50.731
- Yeah.
- I'm just saying.

07:50.774 --> 07:51.819
I was trying
to voice my opinion.

07:51.862 --> 07:52.950
You have your opinion.
It's just--

07:52.994 --> 07:54.822
- Yeah.
- If you guys keep arguing,

07:54.865 --> 07:56.606
I'ma knock one of you out.
- Man, me and you--

07:58.390 --> 08:01.785
Hey, hey, me and Harry
might team back on your ass.

08:01.829 --> 08:03.874
I say, "good luck."

08:15.886 --> 08:17.322
- Yeah.
- Okay.

08:17.366 --> 08:20.674
I'm

08:20.717 --> 08:23.677
Their laugh is amazing.

08:23.720 --> 08:25.592
Don't mind us.

08:28.029 --> 08:30.771
That's an example
of not enough water

08:30.814 --> 08:32.076
and plenty of alcohol.
- And some alcohol.

08:32.120 --> 08:33.513
And some alcohol, yeah.

08:33.556 --> 08:34.949
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

08:34.992 --> 08:36.907
I didn't grow up in Compton.

08:36.951 --> 08:39.693
So if you tell me to do music,
they're assuming I'm a rapper.

08:39.736 --> 08:41.825
And I'm always trying to prove
I'm just Ebie.

08:41.869 --> 08:44.567
I don't want to be known
as Eazy-E's daughter.

14:37.137 --> 14:39.356

the police showed up

"Come with us."

14:42.969 --> 14:44.884

14:46.233 --> 14:49.801

going to live with my dad

14:49.845 --> 14:51.194

15:01.465 --> 15:03.511
I don't live,
like, a rich life.

15:03.554 --> 15:05.078
I grew up
like a homeless person.

15:05.121 --> 15:09.169
We moved once a week
into a new rental house

15:09.212 --> 15:11.040
that my dad was paying for.

15:11.084 --> 15:12.824
<i>We had no food in there.</i>

15:12.868 --> 15:15.697
My mom had lupus

15:15.740 --> 15:19.005
<i>and all the money</i> <i>
was spent toward doctor bills.</i>

15:19.048 --> 15:23.270
I was driving a car at, I don't
know probably 11 years old,

15:23.313 --> 15:26.838

to the emergency room.

15:26.882 --> 15:29.580
I got my first job at 15 1/2.

15:29.624 --> 15:31.713
I worked at
Hows Market in Malibu

15:31.756 --> 15:34.803
and all my paychecks
went to my mom.

15:34.846 --> 15:38.328
I moved in with my dad for,
like, literally six months

15:38.372 --> 15:39.939
<i>and then I was on my own.</i>

15:39.982 --> 15:41.288
And I lived in
a apartment.

15:41.331 --> 15:42.854
I couldn't afford rent,

15:42.898 --> 15:45.031
but the second I bought
my first house,

15:45.074 --> 15:48.556
all my friends say,
"your dad bought you a house."

15:48.599 --> 15:50.775
My dad didn't buy me anything.

15:52.125 --> 15:55.171
But like you said,
like, you think that about us,

15:55.215 --> 15:57.826
but, like, that's why the whole
world sees us a certain way.

15:57.869 --> 15:58.827
It's like--
- Exactly.

15:58.870 --> 16:00.176
It's all about assumptions.

16:02.831 --> 16:04.920
Yeah, actually,
you have more in common

16:04.964 --> 16:07.618
with most of us than you think.

16:08.793 --> 16:12.058
When my dad died, there was,

16:12.101 --> 16:14.930
<i>like, a secret deathbed</i> <i>
marriage that took place</i>

16:14.974 --> 16:17.193
and the woman who married him
on his deathbed,

16:17.237 --> 16:21.023
drew up a will and a trust
that basically took everything.

16:21.067 --> 16:24.679
I don't even have
a T-shirt of my father's.

16:24.722 --> 16:27.899
So for me, growing up,
fortunately my mom

16:27.943 --> 16:29.292
<i>was still in</i> <i>
the music business.</i>

16:29.336 --> 16:31.033
<i>She was a music manager</i> <i>
and she did real estate.</i>

16:31.077 --> 16:33.340
<i>So she did very well</i> <i>
for herself.</i>

16:33.383 --> 16:35.733
And made it appear as if

16:35.777 --> 16:38.998
I was living off
of super-rich Eazy-E.

16:40.477 --> 16:42.088
Then to grow up
in the business,

16:42.131 --> 16:45.352
that was another battle because
I didn't grow up in Compton.

16:45.395 --> 16:47.136
I'm doing pop-rock music.

16:47.180 --> 16:48.529
So if you're telling me
to do music,

16:48.572 --> 16:49.834
they're assuming I'm a rapper.

16:49.878 --> 16:52.533
And I'm always trying to prove
I'm just Ebie.

16:52.576 --> 16:54.970
I don't want to be known
as Eazy-E's daughter.

16:55.014 --> 16:56.928
I hope that one day
they're saying,

16:56.972 --> 16:58.756
he's Ebie's dad.

17:00.106 --> 17:01.194
Mm, mm, mm.

17:03.848 --> 17:07.113
In all honesty, the things
you guys are talking about,

17:07.156 --> 17:10.246
like, I've just--
I've never experienced it.

17:10.290 --> 17:13.815
And so, it's putting it
all into perspective for me.

17:13.858 --> 17:16.513
People think that if you
don't have financial struggles

17:16.557 --> 17:17.601
that everything
is just perfect.

17:17.645 --> 17:18.863
Yeah.

17:18.907 --> 17:20.126
And I'm like,
you don't understand.

17:20.169 --> 17:23.303
I have at times
crippling anxiety.

17:23.346 --> 17:26.828
I've felt isolated before.
I've felt ostracized.

17:26.871 --> 17:28.612
I've felt bullied before.

17:28.656 --> 17:30.658
Money and all of that
kind of stuff

17:30.701 --> 17:32.094
does not make you immune

17:32.138 --> 17:34.096
to the trials
and tribulations of life

17:34.140 --> 17:37.708
and pain and things like that,
you know?

17:37.752 --> 17:40.102
And moments when
I was having panic attacks

17:40.146 --> 17:43.497
and shaking and screaming
and in so much pain,

17:43.540 --> 17:46.108
it didn't matter
how much money I had.

17:46.152 --> 17:48.937
It didn't matter
how much money my family has.

17:50.199 --> 17:52.941
You know, it's all about
just recognizing,

17:52.984 --> 17:55.987
like, what's
really important in life.

17:57.685 --> 17:59.034
<i>Being the children</i> <i>
of celebrities,</i>

17:59.078 --> 18:00.862
<i>we never want</i> <i>

18:00.905 --> 18:03.169
without people
getting to know us first,

18:03.212 --> 18:05.388
but, you know,
I think we kind of did that

18:05.432 --> 18:07.999
to each other when
we first met at the ranch.

18:08.043 --> 18:10.132
You can never judge a book
by its cover, man.

18:10.176 --> 18:11.873
Never, never.

18:11.916 --> 18:14.484
So many layers to everyone,
you know?

18:14.528 --> 18:16.225
Anybody know what time it is?

18:16.269 --> 18:17.574
Midnight maybe?

18:17.618 --> 18:19.402
But we're about to be
so cold in that tent.

18:21.665 --> 18:23.798
Who threw up
outside our tent?

anything else?

28:44.331 --> 28:46.289
I think we're perfect.

28:46.333 --> 28:48.161
But we kind of like this--
being waited on.

28:48.204 --> 28:49.597
Yeah.

28:49.640 --> 28:51.468
You guys deserve it.
You work hard here.

28:53.949 --> 28:57.866
- That's medium right there.
- We got the LA ribeye.

28:59.128 --> 29:00.521
Oh, my God, yum.

29:00.564 --> 29:02.088
Slow and steady
wins the race.

29:02.131 --> 29:03.785
Gotta open it up
in the meat.

29:04.917 --> 29:06.614
Well, if everybody's
ready to go,

29:06.657 --> 29:08.529
everything's up there
ready for you.

29:08.572 --> 29:11.532
Ladies first.
- Okay.

29:11.575 --> 29:13.186
That's a pretty big one,
but I'll take it.

29:13.229 --> 29:14.709
All righty.

29:14.753 --> 29:17.407
I'll give it to the big guy,
whatever I can't eat.

29:17.451 --> 29:20.193
Mm, my favorite steak, ribeye.

29:20.236 --> 29:22.021
Well, don't say that yet
until you try it.

29:23.762 --> 29:26.112
I feel like
somebody special tonight.

29:26.155 --> 29:28.114
Yeah.

29:28.157 --> 29:29.245
Are you gonna serve me
a steak?

29:29.289 --> 29:30.986
- Yes.
- Oh, wow.

29:31.682 --> 29:33.815
So where do you--do you guys
live on the ranch as well too?

29:33.859 --> 29:37.558
- We retired last February...
- Fantastic.

29:37.601 --> 29:39.908
At Grand Junction,
but we'll be down here a lot

29:39.952 --> 29:42.215
just making sure
the boys are doing their job.

29:42.258 --> 29:43.825
Yeah, I hear you.

29:43.869 --> 29:45.740
Are you guys excited
for the grand reopening?

29:45.784 --> 29:48.177
- Yeah.
- I'm so excited for you.

29:48.221 --> 29:49.657
- Yeah.
- It's been really eye-opening.

29:49.700 --> 29:51.790
I've never been around
so many farm animals

29:51.833 --> 29:53.226
and I'm loving it.

29:53.269 --> 29:56.577
It's a lot harder than
I expected, let me tell ya.

29:56.620 --> 29:58.492
Shearing sheep?

29:59.580 --> 30:00.755
My God, look at
all that

30:00.799 --> 30:01.974
That's a lot of

30:02.017 --> 30:05.281
That was hard.

30:05.325 --> 30:07.327
Well, it's great
to have you all here

30:07.370 --> 30:09.329
and thank you
for having us here.

30:09.372 --> 30:11.853
I'm not gonna lie.
It has been very tough.

30:11.897 --> 30:13.507
And there have
been some struggles here,

30:13.550 --> 30:15.552
but I think we're all
gonna walk away with

30:15.596 --> 30:18.338
a lot of lessons and gratitude.

30:18.381 --> 30:20.122
And honestly,
I'm just blessed to be here.

30:20.166 --> 30:21.776
So thank you.

30:21.820 --> 30:23.343
Glad to be able to show you
our way of life.

30:23.386 --> 30:25.519
- Yeah.
- How is your steak?

30:25.562 --> 30:27.913
- This is really good.
- Yeah, it's good, isn't it?

30:27.956 --> 30:31.699
My steak is so good,
I'm sure it came off our ranch.

30:33.179 --> 30:34.745
What would you say
is the most important thing

30:34.789 --> 30:36.182
about ranch life?

30:36.225 --> 30:38.706
The way of life,

30:38.749 --> 30:41.665
the way you raise your family--

30:41.709 --> 30:43.885
just the way you live life.

30:43.929 --> 30:45.452
I know when
I come out of college,

30:45.495 --> 30:47.541
I could've went in to

30:47.584 --> 30:49.586
other things that would've
made me more money,

30:49.630 --> 30:52.763
but I was always
a lover of land and cattle.

30:52.807 --> 30:54.504
You have to go
where the passion is.

30:54.548 --> 30:55.549
- That's right.
- Yeah.

30:55.592 --> 30:57.594
For me,
I'm a different person

30:57.638 --> 30:59.640
when I'm on the back
of a horse.

31:00.206 --> 31:02.556
I just--I come to life.
- That's what I been doing.

31:02.599 --> 31:04.210
I get that.

31:04.253 --> 31:06.777
What were Jerad and Justin
like when they were our age?

31:06.821 --> 31:08.823
- Ooh.
- Did we just go there?

31:08.867 --> 31:10.433
Were they troublemakers?

31:10.477 --> 31:12.740
Actually, they were all
good workers.

31:12.783 --> 31:14.960
<i>Yup, good workers.</i> <i></i>

31:15.003 --> 31:16.918
<i>Which one</i> <i>
was the troublemaker?</i>

31:18.267 --> 31:19.921
- Are you asking?
- Yeah.

31:21.140 --> 31:23.185
I knew it.
I knew it was him.

31:23.229 --> 31:24.795
I had to know.

31:24.839 --> 31:26.623
You know, I've told everybody
I run across here

31:26.667 --> 31:28.843
that I'm pretty sure
I'm not Jerad's mom

31:28.887 --> 31:31.280
because I didn't raise a kid
that ornery.

31:32.586 --> 31:34.240
I think he was switched
at the hospital.

31:34.283 --> 31:35.763
Pretty sure.

31:35.806 --> 31:38.070
Are you guys saying
that this is not my family?

31:40.028 --> 31:42.422
Jerad and Justin's parents
are just--

31:42.465 --> 31:43.902
they're amazing.

31:43.945 --> 31:46.121
<i>They've had a very</i> <i>
unique life, you know?</i>

31:46.165 --> 31:49.255
Very different from our parents
and our grandparents.

31:49.298 --> 31:52.954
And to see what they've built
here is really special.

31:52.998 --> 31:55.174
I'm telling you though,
you guys are really getting it.

31:55.217 --> 31:56.305
- Yeah.
- Oh.

31:56.349 --> 31:57.828
- That means a whole lot.
- Thank you.

31:57.872 --> 31:59.743
It's really cool
to see you guys,

31:59.787 --> 32:01.963
like, come straight off
of, like, the city.

32:02.007 --> 32:04.096
There's a lot of animals,
lot of mouths to feed,

32:04.139 --> 32:05.619
lot of things to take care of.

32:05.662 --> 32:07.273
So what do you think
we should wear?

32:07.316 --> 32:08.970
Um, I think
that would be great.

32:10.450 --> 32:11.451
I didn't know
I was coming outside.

32:11.494 --> 32:12.974
I'm about to work out, okay?

32:13.018 --> 32:15.194
At first, I'm like...

32:15.237 --> 32:16.935
holy cow,
this is not gonna work.

32:16.978 --> 32:18.284
You guys--
- I thought the same thing.

32:18.327 --> 32:19.981
Yeah?

32:20.025 --> 32:20.939
I did.

32:22.201 --> 32:24.029
The willingness to try--

32:24.072 --> 32:26.683
the willingness to try though
is really cool.

32:27.728 --> 32:30.992
All right, time to go.

32:31.819 --> 32:33.647
Think about all those
thousands of acres.

32:33.690 --> 32:36.998
Come on, you could just have
so much marijuana growing.

32:37.042 --> 32:39.348
Man, you are a one-track mind
right there.

32:39.392 --> 32:42.308
This could all be weed.

32:42.351 --> 32:43.787
What is this?

32:46.007 --> 32:47.269
<i>Well, thank you guys</i> <i>
for supper.</i>

32:47.313 --> 32:50.142
<i>Us old people</i> <i>
got to get on home.</i>

32:50.185 --> 32:52.753
- So nice meeting you.
- This has been fun.

32:52.796 --> 32:54.015
- Yes.
- This has been fun.

32:54.059 --> 32:55.625
Thank you guys very much.
- Bye.

32:55.669 --> 32:56.626
- Take care.
- Thank you.

32:56.670 --> 32:58.106
- Take care.
- See you.

32:58.150 --> 32:59.281
<i>I've never really had, like,</i>

32:59.325 --> 33:00.979
a sit down dinner
with my bosses before.

33:01.022 --> 33:02.502
Be safe.

33:02.545 --> 33:05.461
But I actually loved seeing
Justin and Jerad, like,

33:05.505 --> 33:08.116
<i>drinking a little bit and</i> <i>
having fun and cracking jokes.</i>

33:08.160 --> 33:09.857
It's a totally different side

33:09.900 --> 33:11.728
that I think
we all needed to see.

33:11.772 --> 33:14.340
Boy, you guys made my mom
and dad's night right there.

33:14.383 --> 33:15.428
all: Aww.
- They're so wonderful.

33:15.471 --> 33:16.907
They made our night, seriously.

33:16.951 --> 33:18.474
- They're so sweet.
- Amazing.

33:18.518 --> 33:20.999
I didn't think your dad
was gonna be that big of a guy.

33:21.042 --> 33:23.088
Tall, big dude.
- Big guy.

33:23.131 --> 33:25.220
- He was, I mean, awesome.
- A lot of pressure.

33:25.264 --> 33:27.483
I'll tell you what,
the pressure of trying to keep

33:27.527 --> 33:31.357
this ranch going is definitely
really tough, you know?

33:31.400 --> 33:33.794
When they pass it off to you,
you're just like...

33:33.837 --> 33:35.056
Some big shoes to fill.

33:35.100 --> 33:37.885
You know, you think as a kid,

33:37.928 --> 33:40.496
I've got this, no big deal,
you know?

33:40.540 --> 33:44.283
But you've got to take on
the legacy that your parents

33:44.326 --> 33:47.068
<i>and my great-grandpa</i> <i>
brought on.</i>

33:47.112 --> 33:49.505
<i>And now you've got, like,</i> <i>
oh, my goodness.</i>

33:49.549 --> 33:51.072
<i>Just the pressure alone,</i>

33:51.116 --> 33:53.335
<i>sometimes just wants</i> <i>
to crack you, you know?</i>

33:53.379 --> 33:55.859
We all kind of have that
in common with you, I think,

33:55.903 --> 33:59.341
of having, like, parents who,
you know, being famous

33:59.385 --> 34:01.648
and being so big
in their own right

34:01.691 --> 34:03.606
and us being their kids,
it's kind of like,

34:03.650 --> 34:05.173
are we gonna live up to that?

34:05.217 --> 34:06.870
You know, whether
it's in the same field

34:06.914 --> 34:08.524
or if it's in our own way.

34:08.568 --> 34:10.613
Wrestling worked out
in my favor,

34:10.657 --> 34:14.095
trying to step into
that second generation spot,

34:14.139 --> 34:15.488
but I know in the back
of my mind,

34:15.531 --> 34:18.056
I'll never fill the shoes
of my father.

34:18.099 --> 34:20.884
Did you guys ever want
to do something different

34:20.928 --> 34:23.844
other than the ranch life,
or do you guys ever want to,

34:23.887 --> 34:26.542
I don't know, be remembered
for something else?

34:26.586 --> 34:29.371
It's kind of tough
because no matter what,

34:29.415 --> 34:31.721
I think we're always
gonna be remembered as,

34:31.765 --> 34:33.723
you know,
Wayne and Luanna's sons.

34:33.767 --> 34:36.465
It's where we take it
from here, I guess.

34:36.509 --> 34:38.685
Making your own legacy
is really tough.

34:38.728 --> 34:40.991
You know, where there's--
- I mean, like--like--

34:41.035 --> 34:42.297
what you all have.
- Yeah.

34:42.341 --> 34:44.560
That's a struggle,
especially, like, for me.

34:44.604 --> 34:46.693
Well, my father passed away
when I was really young,

34:46.736 --> 34:48.912
and it's kind of crazy to--

34:48.956 --> 34:50.784
for me to, like,
succeed at anything,

34:50.827 --> 34:52.046
and for people
to still be like,

34:52.090 --> 34:53.613
"It's because
you're Eazy-E's daughter."

34:53.656 --> 34:55.963
And I'm like, for me, it's
probably even worse than them

34:56.006 --> 34:57.225
'cause I'm like,
well, my father's not here.

34:57.269 --> 34:59.097
Like, he's not
making phone calls for me.

34:59.140 --> 35:00.881
He's not--you know,
I don't have any handouts.

35:00.924 --> 35:02.404
It's completely different
for me.

35:02.448 --> 35:04.711
It's irritating.
No matter how hard you work,

35:04.754 --> 35:06.756
people think
everything's handed to you

35:06.800 --> 35:09.411
if your parent's a celebrity,
you know what I mean?

35:09.455 --> 35:11.587
You just feel like you're
just trying to constantly

35:11.631 --> 35:14.112
prove yourself
over and over and over again,

35:14.155 --> 35:15.417
and it gets exhausting,

35:15.461 --> 35:17.245
but you just have
to keep pushing forward.

35:17.289 --> 35:19.900
But yeah, it's part
of the territory, you know?

35:19.943 --> 35:22.772
I definitely think
that we're under

35:22.816 --> 35:26.602
a very fine microscope
with a lot of the locals.

35:26.646 --> 35:29.736
They obviously know
that my parents stepped away.

35:29.779 --> 35:34.306
And so I think they're like,

35:34.349 --> 35:36.177
"All right, let's see
what these guys have."

35:36.221 --> 35:37.396
A lot of people are like,

35:37.439 --> 35:39.224
"Are these guys
gonna be able to do it?"

35:39.267 --> 35:40.442
- Ooh.
- You know?

35:40.486 --> 35:43.271
It would be so much easier
to just sell out

35:43.315 --> 35:45.273
and just be done,
but then they're like,

35:45.317 --> 35:47.971
"Oh, they took the easy route."
- Mm-hmm.

35:48.015 --> 35:51.453
The easy route is not always
the right route, you know?

35:51.497 --> 35:53.977
But then the thing is,
is that obviously,

35:54.021 --> 35:58.025
financially, we need to be
making money off the ranch so...

35:58.068 --> 35:59.940
I don't know if
it's the word of mouth

35:59.983 --> 36:02.160
and it helps you guys,
but for us to build our brand,

36:02.203 --> 36:04.466
we rely on social media
so much.

36:04.510 --> 36:07.817
One Instagram post can go viral
from Saddleback Ranch,

36:07.861 --> 36:10.690
and it goes from 10,000 people
to 10 million people

36:10.733 --> 36:12.257
and it's just like that.

36:12.300 --> 36:14.998
Instagram?
I've never been on it.

36:15.042 --> 36:17.044
I have no idea.

36:17.871 --> 36:20.178
Oh, my God.
That's the craziest thing.

36:20.221 --> 36:21.614
I have two accounts.

36:21.657 --> 36:23.485
One's my main page
and then one's my jewelry line.

36:23.529 --> 36:25.661
I have my personal
Instagram account.

36:25.705 --> 36:27.054
You know,
one for real estate.

36:27.097 --> 36:28.838
Another account
for my food page.

36:28.882 --> 36:30.188
Then I have one for myself.

36:30.231 --> 36:32.712
It's all in branding,
Justin and Jerad.

36:32.755 --> 36:35.497
I mean, my dog
has a social media account.

36:35.541 --> 36:37.847
<i>[dog barks]</i> <i>
Good girl.</i>

36:43.157 --> 36:44.854
Wow.

36:44.898 --> 36:49.250
I've heard about Facebook,
but I don't own a computer.

36:49.294 --> 36:52.384
I haven't been on a computer
in probably,

36:52.427 --> 36:55.125
I don't know, 10, 15 years?
- That's so crazy to hear.

36:55.169 --> 36:56.692
It's crazy 'cause earlier,
we were saying--

36:56.736 --> 36:58.520
I think Hana said,
she feels like

36:58.564 --> 37:00.522
the time had been going slow
out here.

37:00.566 --> 37:02.045
And I was like,
you know what, it is,

37:02.089 --> 37:04.613
because at home we're
constantly on social media.

37:04.657 --> 37:05.701
We're on our phones
all the time

37:05.745 --> 37:07.268
and everything moves
so quickly.

37:07.312 --> 37:09.183
Here, we're up early
in the morning for our job.

37:09.227 --> 37:11.272
We have, like, long days

37:11.316 --> 37:12.882
especially 'cause it feels like
it's going by slow.

37:12.926 --> 37:14.623
I'm like, I think we're actually
just present in the moment.

37:14.667 --> 37:16.321
- Yeah.
- For like, the first time.

37:16.364 --> 37:18.061
I think it's very hard
for us to do that in LA.

37:18.105 --> 37:19.454
- Mm.
- Mm-hmm.

37:19.498 --> 37:20.934
Don't want to get
a little side tracked,

37:20.977 --> 37:24.503
but you guys are sitting on
modern day oil right now.

37:24.546 --> 37:27.549
Think about all those thousands
of acres you're not using.

37:27.593 --> 37:30.900
<i>I'm like, you could just have</i> <i>
so much marijuana growing.</i>

37:30.944 --> 37:33.207
<i>You know, you've seen</i> <i>
"The Beverly Hillbillies."</i>

37:33.251 --> 37:35.949
This could all be weed.

37:35.992 --> 37:38.168
Man, you are a one-track mind
right there.

37:38.212 --> 37:39.779
No.

37:39.822 --> 37:41.955
You see an opportunity,
and you go at it.

37:41.998 --> 37:43.391
I envy that. I really do.

37:43.435 --> 37:46.046
My dad would be out there
spraying them.

37:46.089 --> 37:47.700
"What is this?"

37:49.876 --> 37:51.312
I'm really, really tired,

37:51.356 --> 37:53.401
so I wanna thank you all
very much for dinner tonight.

37:53.445 --> 37:54.707
- Yes, thank you.
- It's been a lot of fun.

37:54.750 --> 37:56.274
- Thank you guys for coming.
- Lots of fun.

37:56.317 --> 37:58.972
And mornings come early
around here.

37:59.015 --> 38:00.582
I think I better
go get some sleep.

38:00.626 --> 38:02.062
- All right.
- You should too.

38:02.105 --> 38:05.413
I'll see y'all tomorrow
and we'll get back to work.

38:05.457 --> 38:06.414
- Yes, sir.
- Sounds good.

38:06.458 --> 38:07.546
- Thanks.
- This was great.

38:07.589 --> 38:08.547
Thank you all.

38:08.590 --> 38:10.418
Have a good night.

38:11.550 --> 38:13.116
- Cheers.
- Thank you.

38:13.160 --> 38:14.292
Have a good night.
- Bye, guys.

38:14.335 --> 38:15.641
- Good night.
- Thank you.

38:23.823 --> 38:25.477
Jas, you can do it.

38:25.520 --> 38:26.695
Come on.
- It's been years.

38:26.739 --> 38:28.175
Jazzy, let's go.

<i>It's sad that we're leaving</i> <i>

38:30.656 --> 38:33.223
I mean, this has been
a crazy experience.

All right, love you all.

38:42.668 --> 38:45.192
To a few more nights
here together.

38:45.932 --> 38:47.325
And then I'll never
see you again.

38:47.368 --> 38:48.935
Then I'll see you in LA.

38:48.978 --> 38:50.676
all: Cheers.

38:53.461 --> 38:54.897
Keep it going, Austin.

38:54.941 --> 38:57.944

39:38.593 --> 39:40.987

39:41.030 --> 39:42.641

I'm sorry.
Are you okay?

39:44.033 --> 39:45.818
Ow.

39:45.861 --> 39:49.169
- Not the nose job.
- Ow!

39:49.212 --> 39:53.913
- Dude, Austin Hans up.
- Ow.

39:53.956 --> 39:54.827
- He hurt her nose.
- Stop, dude.

39:54.870 --> 39:56.132
What happened?

39:56.176 --> 39:57.743
I didn't mean to.
I didn't even see her.

39:57.786 --> 40:00.136
Sorry, Han.
I'm so sorry.

40:00.180 --> 40:02.225
That's so embarrassing.

40:11.713 --> 40:13.454
Oh, yeah.

40:13.498 --> 40:15.630
I was teaching her
what a receipt is.

40:15.674 --> 40:17.676
Okay.

40:17.719 --> 40:19.504
No, you can't
tell her that, bro.

40:20.983 --> 40:23.682
Me and Austin always say,
"I'm gonna you up.

40:23.725 --> 40:25.945
I'm gonna hit you
in the face."

40:25.988 --> 40:28.121
like that, <i>
but when it comes to Hana,</i>

40:28.164 --> 40:29.731

Easy.
- No.

40:38.827 --> 40:41.177
Whoa. Whoa!

40:43.919 --> 40:46.313
No.

40:46.356 --> 40:47.575
Ow.

40:47.619 --> 40:49.447
- That's so sexual.
- Come on.

40:51.536 --> 40:53.233
Ma'am--oh, my God!

40:54.321 --> 40:55.453
She's a biter!

40:55.496 --> 40:57.933
- Kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss.
- She's a biter.

40:57.977 --> 40:59.892
Kiss.

41:00.414 --> 41:01.850
I dare you to kiss her.

41:02.808 --> 41:04.113
Kiss her.
- He did, he did it.

41:04.157 --> 41:05.201
Go in for the real thing, dawg.

41:05.245 --> 41:06.507
No, for like a real kiss.

41:06.551 --> 41:09.292

- There we go.

41:21.957 --> 41:23.785
Wait, ten seconds.
Ready?

41:23.829 --> 41:26.266
One, two, three, <i>
l'chaim,</i> go.

41:26.309 --> 41:28.573
Hey, use your hands this time.
Get a handful.

41:28.616 --> 41:31.097
Get in there.

41:31.140 --> 41:32.838
You should've
got the other hands.

41:32.881 --> 41:34.840
One, two, three,
ten seconds, go.

41:34.883 --> 41:37.669
Go.
- No, your hands, bro.

41:37.712 --> 41:39.584
There you go.
He's learning.

41:39.627 --> 41:42.021
There we go.

41:42.064 --> 41:44.284
Ten seconds, keep going,

41:44.327 --> 41:46.025

naturally do our thing.

41:57.079 --> 41:59.560
Keep it going, Austin.
We're at 21 seconds.

41:59.604 --> 42:02.563
Whoo!

42:02.607 --> 42:04.957
Am I in middle school?
What is happening?

42:05.000 --> 42:06.306
You can kiss me on your own,

42:06.349 --> 42:07.916
you don't need to be timed
by Harry.

42:10.092 --> 42:12.530

Tay.
- What?

42:36.902 --> 42:39.557

- Ew.

Whew.
