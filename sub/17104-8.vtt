WEBVTT

00:02.200 --> 00:04.799
-Previously, on "Dance
Academy"--

00:04.839 --> 00:06.400
-Your upper body looks
like a stick.

00:06.440 --> 00:07.639
There's no grooving.

00:07.679 --> 00:10.080
-That's because I'm
a ballet dancer.

00:10.119 --> 00:12.039
-Carbs after 3:00?

00:12.080 --> 00:14.720
I'd rather eat a deep-fried
vending machine.

00:14.759 --> 00:16.800
-Tara doesn't want to room with
you, so just sign the

00:16.839 --> 00:18.280
form.

00:18.320 --> 00:19.800
-Has it ever occurred to you
that the reason I won't change

00:19.839 --> 00:22.600
rooms is because
you want me to?

00:22.640 --> 00:25.800
-If I ever have to pick up
after you again, I'll get

00:25.839 --> 00:26.559
violent.

00:26.600 --> 00:28.440
-Is that a promise?

00:28.480 --> 00:30.800
-Ethan, I made you a mix CD.

00:30.839 --> 00:32.520
It's just a few dance tracks--

00:32.560 --> 00:33.200
some contemporary--

00:33.240 --> 00:35.560
-She isn't.

00:35.600 --> 00:38.320
-No, she is.

00:38.359 --> 00:40.320
[theme music]

00:51.719 --> 00:54.640
THEME SONG: Take a breath.

00:54.679 --> 00:58.240
Close your eyes.

00:58.280 --> 01:02.640
Take a leap of faith and
lead the way tonight.

01:07.239 --> 01:08.400
This is my chance.

01:08.439 --> 01:12.159
This is my chance-- my
chance to feel alive.

01:33.480 --> 01:37.560
-Hey, Ethan, you're
working late.

01:37.599 --> 01:40.040
Hey.

01:40.079 --> 01:41.239
Hi.

01:43.359 --> 01:44.239
I saw the light.

01:44.280 --> 01:45.400
You're working--

01:45.439 --> 01:46.640
hey.

01:49.159 --> 01:51.159
Hey.

01:51.200 --> 01:52.560
Saw the light.

01:52.599 --> 01:54.200
You're working late.

01:54.239 --> 01:55.519
-Just trying some ideas.

01:55.560 --> 01:56.879
-Oh.

01:56.920 --> 01:58.640
So I saw there's this
contemporary group coming from

01:58.680 --> 02:01.840
Alice Springs performing
Wednesday night.

02:01.879 --> 02:05.400
I thought it might give
you some inspiration.

02:05.439 --> 02:08.280
-I don't know if that's
the best idea-- you

02:08.318 --> 02:09.598
and me going out.

02:09.639 --> 02:11.599
-Oh, it wouldn't have to be
a-- a date or anything.

02:17.560 --> 02:20.199
-Look, it's not like I don't
think you're great a kid, but,

02:20.240 --> 02:23.080
I mean, you're Kat's
best friend.

02:23.120 --> 02:24.439
You're like my other
little sister.

02:27.439 --> 02:28.599
-OK.

02:40.319 --> 02:42.080
TARA (OFFSCREEN): When I was
three, I took a vow of silence

02:42.120 --> 02:46.199
until my parents let
me start ballet.

02:46.240 --> 02:48.599
I was the youngest kid ever
to attend the [inaudible]

02:48.639 --> 02:51.800
Ballet School, the youngest
winner in the regional

02:51.840 --> 02:53.800
[inaudible].

02:53.840 --> 02:55.560
I used to like being
the youngest.

02:58.639 --> 03:01.800
But these days, it just feels
like another liability,

03:01.840 --> 03:04.120
especially in this place, where
we all know each other's

03:04.159 --> 03:05.319
weaknesses.

03:09.639 --> 03:11.159
We keep tabs on everything--

03:11.199 --> 03:14.159
who has the best arms, the
best feet, the best

03:14.199 --> 03:15.319
technique--

03:15.360 --> 03:17.159
which means our bodies
are on display 24/7.

03:20.639 --> 03:23.599
There's no such thing
as privacy.

03:23.639 --> 03:24.639
-Whoa.

03:24.680 --> 03:26.639
CHRISTIAN (OFFSCREEN):
Dude, get out.

03:26.680 --> 03:27.240
-Sorry.

03:27.280 --> 03:28.639
Sorry, Christian.

03:28.680 --> 03:30.080
Sorry, mate.

03:30.120 --> 03:32.800
TARA (OFFSCREEN): And no small
flaw ever goes unnoticed.

03:32.840 --> 03:34.719
-Will you stop doing that?

03:34.759 --> 03:37.080
-Stop doing what?

03:37.120 --> 03:38.759
-I call this one The Thinker.

03:38.800 --> 03:39.719
It's just a pimple.

03:39.759 --> 03:41.520
Wear it with pride.

03:41.560 --> 03:42.159
Ah.

03:42.199 --> 03:42.800
-Hey, Kitty Kat.

03:42.840 --> 03:43.800
KAT (OFFSCREEN): Hi.

03:43.840 --> 03:45.319
-Oh, what happened there?

03:45.360 --> 03:48.319
-Oh, gosh, did you think that
one up all by yourself?

03:48.360 --> 03:49.520
-Yep.

03:49.560 --> 03:51.159
Um, Tara, about that, uh,
thing that you've

03:51.199 --> 03:52.520
got on your, um--

03:57.879 --> 03:59.639
-He's only two years
older than me.

03:59.680 --> 04:02.120
Where does he get off treating
me like a little kid?

04:02.159 --> 04:04.479
-Uh, maybe because you lose
the capacity to speak in

04:04.520 --> 04:06.560
complete sentences around him?

04:06.599 --> 04:10.199
Oh, um, so, Ethan, do you--

04:10.240 --> 04:11.680
would you--

04:11.719 --> 04:13.280
I love you.

04:13.319 --> 04:14.319
Sorry.

04:14.360 --> 04:15.240
Ow!

04:15.280 --> 04:16.600
It's true, though.

04:44.839 --> 04:46.639
-Katrina, your hair is a mess.

04:52.720 --> 04:53.439
Tara, posture.

04:53.480 --> 04:55.120
Tail in, shoulders back.

05:21.240 --> 05:23.639
Abigail, you're out
of uniform.

05:23.680 --> 05:25.160
-I'm still a little cold.

05:25.199 --> 05:26.319
-Were you here for warm up?

05:26.360 --> 05:27.079
-Of course.

05:27.120 --> 05:28.560
-Then take that thing off.

05:28.600 --> 05:30.319
I need to be able to correct
your body, unless, of course,

05:30.360 --> 05:31.680
you think I have nothing
to teach you.

05:31.720 --> 05:33.240
-Of course not, Ms. Raine.

05:33.279 --> 05:35.600
It's just I think I might be
coming down with something.

05:35.639 --> 05:37.040
I feel a bit shivery.

05:37.079 --> 05:39.600
-Ms. Armstrong, you are ready
to work or at the doctor.

05:39.639 --> 05:40.800
Which is it?

05:49.639 --> 05:50.800
Back to the beginning, please.

05:55.680 --> 05:58.319
-Is it tender?

05:58.360 --> 05:59.639
OK.

05:59.680 --> 06:01.680
Slip your crossover off and
I'll check your lungs.

06:01.720 --> 06:03.519
-Is that necessary?

06:03.560 --> 06:05.319
It's more of a head cold.

06:07.839 --> 06:10.279
-Yeah, I need to check that
your lungs are clear.

06:10.319 --> 06:12.199
-Well, can't you do it on top?

06:12.240 --> 06:13.600
It's freezing in here.

06:13.639 --> 06:14.800
-No.

06:23.560 --> 06:25.199
Goodness, that sports
bra is very tight.

06:25.240 --> 06:26.439
Maybe you should go up a size.

06:26.480 --> 06:30.160
-Maybe I didn't come here
for fashion advice.

06:30.199 --> 06:32.319
-And again.

06:32.360 --> 06:35.079
-Not that it's any of your
business, but I'm the same

06:35.120 --> 06:36.319
size I've always been.

06:40.079 --> 06:41.800
-Well, your lungs are clear.

06:41.839 --> 06:42.759
-But I--

06:42.800 --> 06:44.399
I still have a head
cold, right?

06:44.439 --> 06:46.279
I mean, I don't want
to make it worse.

06:46.319 --> 06:48.680
-Abigail, you do know that for
your height and weight, you're

06:48.720 --> 06:50.240
in perfect proportion,
don't you?

06:50.279 --> 06:52.839
It's normal to be developing.

06:52.879 --> 06:55.319
-I'm not developing.

06:55.360 --> 06:57.399
And I'm certainly
not most girls.

07:00.439 --> 07:01.839
-And soubresaut, chasse,
pas de bourre.

07:06.120 --> 07:08.120
Another single tour.

07:08.160 --> 07:11.639
Double tour on the last one.

07:11.680 --> 07:12.319
Great.

07:12.360 --> 07:14.399
And pirouette to finish.

07:14.439 --> 07:15.600
And finish.

07:15.639 --> 07:16.720
Hold it.

07:16.759 --> 07:18.680
Better.

07:18.720 --> 07:20.639
That's it for today, everyone.

07:24.240 --> 07:25.360
-Hey, wait a minute.

07:25.399 --> 07:26.040
What's this?

07:26.079 --> 07:27.680
What are you wearing?

07:27.720 --> 07:29.240
-Something funny?

07:29.279 --> 07:30.519
Don't touch him.

07:30.560 --> 07:33.600
-Hey, is this a ballet school
or a boxing ring?

07:33.639 --> 07:34.800
-Right, Sean.

07:34.839 --> 07:35.680
You can explain to Mr.
Kennedy why you think

07:35.720 --> 07:37.199
wedgies are so hilarious.

07:37.240 --> 07:39.399
The rest of you, out
of here, now.

07:39.439 --> 07:42.680
Not so fast, Christian.

07:42.720 --> 07:46.199
Lieberman, where's
your dance belt?

07:46.240 --> 07:47.360
-I don't believe in them, sir.

07:47.399 --> 07:48.319
TEACHER (OFFSCREEN): Don't
be ridiculous.

07:48.360 --> 07:49.279
It's uniform.

07:49.319 --> 07:50.639
Every male dancer
wears support.

07:50.680 --> 07:52.079
-I swear, I really
don't own one.

07:52.120 --> 07:53.480
-Well, I don't know how you
managed to get away without

07:53.519 --> 07:55.639
one, but your little rebellion
is officially over.

07:55.680 --> 07:57.120
I'm giving you a note to
miss study period.

07:57.160 --> 07:58.480
You're going on a
shopping trip.

07:58.519 --> 07:59.399
Oh, and Christian?

07:59.439 --> 08:01.360
You're his wingman.

08:01.399 --> 08:02.240
-What?

08:02.279 --> 08:03.319
-What's this got
to do with me?

08:03.360 --> 08:04.560
-Consider it character
building.

08:23.279 --> 08:24.600
-Hey, you're Tara
Webster, right?

08:24.639 --> 08:26.519
-Yeah, but-- you're
in the company.

08:26.560 --> 08:27.639
You're Damien Lang.

08:27.680 --> 08:28.519
-Uh, yeah, Damo.

08:28.560 --> 08:30.160
Hi.

08:30.199 --> 08:31.399
Look, I've been trying to track
you down ever since we

08:31.439 --> 08:32.399
got back from the tour.

08:32.440 --> 08:32.840
-Really?

08:32.879 --> 08:33.600
-Yeah.

08:33.639 --> 08:34.879
My mum's Shirley Lang.

08:34.919 --> 08:36.080
And she knows your mum from
the Country Women's

08:36.120 --> 08:36.558
Association.

08:36.600 --> 08:37.159
-Of course.

08:37.200 --> 08:38.120
Miss Shirley.

08:38.159 --> 08:38.799
She adjudicates the
[inaudible].

08:38.840 --> 08:40.399
She's terrifying--

08:40.440 --> 08:40.919
in--

08:40.960 --> 08:41.480
in a good way.

08:41.519 --> 08:41.840
-No.

08:41.879 --> 08:42.360
No.

08:42.399 --> 08:43.799
No.

08:43.840 --> 08:45.159
You know, I had to, uh, talk to
you when she asked me to.

08:45.200 --> 08:47.399
-My mum is going to flip when
I tell her I met you.

08:47.440 --> 08:50.120
We saw you dance at the Easter
show once, and-- and when you

08:50.159 --> 08:51.120
got into the company,
there was like a

08:51.159 --> 08:51.720
parade in your honor.

08:51.759 --> 08:52.600
You're a legend.

08:52.639 --> 08:56.399
-Well, yeah, only locally.

08:56.440 --> 08:57.279
DAMIEN (OFFSCREEN):
Well, it's, uh--

08:57.320 --> 08:58.600
it's been a pleasure.

08:58.639 --> 09:00.600
I'll, uh, have to listen to
my mother more often.

09:37.879 --> 09:38.919
-Sorry.

09:38.960 --> 09:39.799
Do you work at being
annoying, or does

09:39.840 --> 09:41.399
it just come naturally?

09:41.440 --> 09:43.159
-I didn't see you there.

09:43.200 --> 09:43.840
-It's not mine.

09:43.879 --> 09:44.399
I don't eat chocolate.

09:44.440 --> 09:44.840
-Are you sure?

09:44.879 --> 09:45.519
Because--

09:45.559 --> 09:46.159
-(MOCKNIG) Are you sure?

09:46.200 --> 09:46.799
Because--

09:46.840 --> 09:47.519
what are you, five?

09:47.559 --> 09:48.759
Just leave me alone.

09:56.720 --> 10:00.639
-Oh, there's one
in every year.

10:00.679 --> 10:02.120
You OK?

10:02.159 --> 10:04.279
-Yeah, I just have this skill
at making a fool of myself.

10:04.320 --> 10:05.519
-Look, you can't worry about
what people here

10:05.559 --> 10:06.639
think of you, all right?

10:06.679 --> 10:07.639
We're from Mallee country.

10:07.679 --> 10:08.639
We're supposed to be
tough, remember.

10:08.679 --> 10:09.240
-Right.

10:09.279 --> 10:10.480
Real tough.

10:10.519 --> 10:12.320
-Yeah.

10:12.360 --> 10:13.639
Here, hand it over.

10:20.639 --> 10:21.799
-Thanks.

10:36.519 --> 10:38.320
-Admit it, Christian--

10:38.360 --> 10:41.600
dance belts are hot
and uncomfortable.

10:41.639 --> 10:43.799
They stink.

10:43.840 --> 10:44.440
They look stupid.

10:44.480 --> 10:46.480
I mean--

10:46.519 --> 10:48.600
and they're unhygienic, so--

10:48.639 --> 10:50.320
-That's why you wash them.

10:50.360 --> 10:51.639
-You wash them?

10:51.679 --> 10:55.399
Have you ever seen me do my
own washing, Christian?

10:55.440 --> 10:57.480
No, I take it home to mum.

10:57.519 --> 10:58.799
I can't ask her to go there.

11:02.679 --> 11:05.159
You know, what is happening to
us is a form of oppression.

11:05.200 --> 11:07.279
And I don't like it.

11:07.320 --> 11:10.639
Do you reckon if I jumped I'd
make it to the shore alive?

11:10.679 --> 11:13.240
-That may be bad for
your health.

11:13.279 --> 11:15.519
Like a dance belt.

11:15.559 --> 11:18.200
I mean, seriously, I've
done the research.

11:18.240 --> 11:20.519
Do you know what overheating
does to man's sperm count?

11:20.559 --> 11:20.840
-OK.

11:20.879 --> 11:21.639
No.

11:21.679 --> 11:22.279
No.

11:22.320 --> 11:22.759
-No, seriously.

11:22.799 --> 11:23.600
No, listen.

11:23.639 --> 11:24.960
CHRISTIAN (OFFSCREEN): Don't.

11:25.000 --> 11:26.240
-What about when I want to
have children, Christian?

11:26.279 --> 11:28.159
-If I wanted a wedgie I'd
just ask Sean, right?

11:28.200 --> 11:28.840
CHRISTIAN (OFFSCREEN):
We're here.

11:28.879 --> 11:29.879
You're getting one, OK?

11:29.919 --> 11:30.720
SAMMY (OFFSCREEN): I'm
not getting one.

11:30.759 --> 11:31.080
CHRISTIAN (OFFSCREEN): You are.

11:31.120 --> 11:32.159
-Hi.

11:32.200 --> 11:33.279
You guys need some help?

11:33.320 --> 11:34.519
-Nope, we're just browsing
at the moment.

11:34.559 --> 11:36.240
-No, he needs a dance belt.

11:36.279 --> 11:37.440
-What size do you want?

11:37.480 --> 11:38.720
SAMMY (OFFSCREEN): I don't
actually want one.

11:38.759 --> 11:42.399
I don't believe in their
validity or necessity.

11:42.440 --> 11:44.600
-I think you'll find they're
actually not that bad once you

11:44.639 --> 11:47.200
get used to them.

11:47.240 --> 11:48.519
What size do you
think you are?

11:48.559 --> 11:51.440
-Um what's your biggest?

11:51.480 --> 11:52.399
What?

11:52.440 --> 11:53.639
-They're based on
jean sizes, so--

11:53.679 --> 11:54.639
-Oh.

11:54.679 --> 11:55.639
OK.

11:55.679 --> 11:56.480
31.

11:56.519 --> 11:57.799
-OK.

11:57.840 --> 12:01.720
Why don't you give
this one a try?

12:01.759 --> 12:02.480
-Yeah, sure.

12:02.519 --> 12:03.159
Yes.

12:03.200 --> 12:04.240
Yeah, that one.

12:08.759 --> 12:09.720
Hey.

12:09.759 --> 12:11.080
Hey.

12:18.360 --> 12:19.480
What is this?

12:25.320 --> 12:26.600
-Step away from the pimple.

12:26.639 --> 12:28.200
It's gonna pop all by itself
when I tell you

12:28.240 --> 12:29.399
what I've just heard.

12:29.440 --> 12:30.399
Wow.

12:30.440 --> 12:32.360
Artistic.

12:32.399 --> 12:33.759
OK.

12:33.799 --> 12:34.879
So two of the most stuck up
girls in second year just

12:34.919 --> 12:36.120
bombarded me with questions
about you're

12:36.159 --> 12:37.600
dating Damien Lang.

12:37.639 --> 12:38.360
-Damo?

12:38.399 --> 12:39.240
No way.

12:39.279 --> 12:40.360
KAT (OFFSCREEN): Yes, way.

12:40.399 --> 12:41.639
The entire school is
obsessing about it.

12:41.679 --> 12:43.120
-What did you tell them?

12:43.159 --> 12:45.639
-That I was not at liberty to
discuss your personal life.

12:45.679 --> 12:48.320
I think they took that
as a definite yes.

12:48.360 --> 12:51.159
-Our mothers know each other.

12:51.200 --> 12:52.639
But if people want to talk,
who am I to take

12:52.679 --> 12:53.799
that away from them?

12:53.840 --> 12:55.519
It's not like I started
the rumor.

12:55.559 --> 12:58.159
And anyway, I could totally
date a company

12:58.200 --> 13:00.399
member, don't you think?

13:00.440 --> 13:01.639
-So proud right now.

13:01.679 --> 13:03.639
-So do you reckon Ethan's
heard about us?

13:03.679 --> 13:06.399
You know, Damo and me?

13:06.440 --> 13:07.600
-Less proud.

13:12.080 --> 13:14.200
-The doctor said I'm well enough
to dance, but as a

13:14.240 --> 13:17.080
medical precaution, I should
keep my crossover on, just in

13:17.120 --> 13:18.600
case I'm coming down
with the flu.

13:18.639 --> 13:21.799
-I'm intrigued to
see the note.

13:21.840 --> 13:23.159
-She didn't put that bit
in writing, but she

13:23.200 --> 13:24.679
asked me to tell you.

13:24.720 --> 13:26.039
-The note?

13:37.639 --> 13:40.200
I don't know what's got
into you, Abigail.

13:40.240 --> 13:42.200
All that's written here is that
you present with symptoms

13:42.240 --> 13:44.480
not inconsistent with
a slight cold.

13:44.519 --> 13:46.399
I suppose you can sit
the class our.

13:46.440 --> 13:47.679
-But she said I'm OK to dance.

13:47.720 --> 13:50.080
-Then you will abide
by my uniform code.

13:54.600 --> 13:55.799
Ladies who are prepared
to dance.

14:00.480 --> 14:01.639
Come on.

14:09.519 --> 14:10.679
Artistry.

14:12.679 --> 14:18.159
And sustain to the end.

14:18.200 --> 14:19.360
Thank you.

14:21.240 --> 14:22.279
Tara.

14:22.320 --> 14:23.600
Come to the front so
I can demonstrate

14:23.639 --> 14:24.799
something to the class.

14:27.840 --> 14:29.799
Girls.

14:29.840 --> 14:32.600
Let me draw your attention to
the hideous amount of makeup

14:32.639 --> 14:34.799
Tara has decided to inflict
on herself.

14:34.840 --> 14:37.240
I'd like to remind you that
while makeup is allowed, it

14:37.279 --> 14:39.120
should be kept tasteful.

14:39.159 --> 14:42.039
-Ms. Raine, I'm sorry to
disagree with you, but I

14:42.080 --> 14:44.519
believe that I am old enough now
to decide what I put on my

14:44.559 --> 14:48.360
face and even though you
may not like it, I do.

14:54.240 --> 14:58.279
-Thank you for that opinion,
Tara, but this is my class.

14:58.320 --> 15:02.519
And that means no excessive
makeup.

15:02.559 --> 15:06.480
And proper attire
at all times.

15:06.519 --> 15:07.679
Thank you.

15:13.840 --> 15:15.159
-Is everything OK in there?

15:15.200 --> 15:15.840
SAMMY (OFFSCREEN):
Um, Christian?

15:15.879 --> 15:16.799
Is he there?

15:16.840 --> 15:20.279
Christian, can you
come here a sec?

15:20.320 --> 15:21.639
Christian.

15:21.679 --> 15:23.080
-What can possibly be so hard?

15:23.120 --> 15:24.799
I mean, if you want me to
demonstrate, I'm not going to.

15:24.840 --> 15:25.360
-Nothing, nothing.

15:25.399 --> 15:26.200
It's fine.

15:26.240 --> 15:27.159
It's surprisingly comfortable.

15:27.200 --> 15:29.159
-Then why are you
taking so long?

15:29.200 --> 15:31.080
-I've been giving you
two some time.

15:31.120 --> 15:32.399
She's been checking you out.

15:32.440 --> 15:34.799
And don't you think
she's cute?

15:34.840 --> 15:36.360
Excuse me.

15:36.399 --> 15:36.799
Hi.

15:36.840 --> 15:37.480
Hi, um--

15:37.519 --> 15:38.200
-Haley.

15:38.240 --> 15:39.240
-Haley.

15:39.279 --> 15:41.200
Haley, can you come here
a sec, please?

15:41.240 --> 15:42.799
I take back everything I
said about dance belts.

15:42.840 --> 15:43.639
-Don't you?

15:43.679 --> 15:44.279
Yeah.

15:44.320 --> 15:44.919
I'm gonna--

15:44.960 --> 15:45.480
I'm gonna take five.

15:45.519 --> 15:46.840
-OK.

15:46.879 --> 15:48.320
-Can I also try on some shorts
over the top of them?

15:48.360 --> 15:49.159
-Yeah, sure thing.

15:49.200 --> 15:49.519
SAMMY (OFFSCREEN): OK.

15:49.559 --> 15:49.879
Great.

15:49.919 --> 15:51.240
Thanks.

15:51.279 --> 15:54.360
Also my pal Christian's gonna
help you pick out some.

15:54.399 --> 15:55.320
-OK.

15:55.360 --> 15:56.559
SAMMY (OFFSCREEN): Thanks.

16:00.240 --> 16:01.559
-They're all just here.

16:01.600 --> 16:03.039
So--

16:03.080 --> 16:04.240
SAMMY (OFFSCREEN): Christian, I
gave her to you on a silver

16:04.279 --> 16:05.639
platter, and you died in it.

16:05.679 --> 16:06.679
-Oh, did I now?

16:06.720 --> 16:07.679
All right.

16:07.720 --> 16:08.639
Hm.

16:08.679 --> 16:10.639
Oh, what's that?

16:10.679 --> 16:12.200
-I don't believe it.

16:12.240 --> 16:14.159
-All right.

16:14.200 --> 16:15.559
HALEY (OFFSCREEN):
Hi, it's Haley.

16:15.600 --> 16:17.480
Pretty soon, there's gonna
be a little beep.

16:17.519 --> 16:18.159
Be brave.

16:18.200 --> 16:20.080
Leave a message.

16:20.120 --> 16:20.799
-Haley, it's--

16:20.840 --> 16:21.360
-Wait.

16:21.399 --> 16:22.159
Wait.

16:22.200 --> 16:22.799
-It's Christian being brave.

16:22.840 --> 16:23.639
-Give me the phone.

16:23.679 --> 16:24.559
-Call me.

16:24.600 --> 16:25.200
-Give me the phone.

16:25.240 --> 16:25.600
-Or whatever.

16:25.639 --> 16:27.120
Bye.

16:27.159 --> 16:30.159
-That was the worst impression
of me ever.

16:30.200 --> 16:31.120
-Right.

16:31.159 --> 16:32.200
It was too articulate,
wasn't it?

16:43.559 --> 16:44.840
KAT (OFFSCREEN): Tara,
[inaudible]

16:44.879 --> 16:45.840
one down.

16:45.879 --> 16:46.440
We're gonna be late
for breakfast.

16:46.480 --> 16:47.720
-Get out!

16:47.759 --> 16:50.080
-Whoa, banshee.

16:50.120 --> 16:53.399
-You have no right to barge into
people's rooms like that.

16:53.440 --> 16:55.480
-Happily leaving you to your
little psycho drama.

17:04.400 --> 17:07.598
-Leave me alone, Kat.

17:07.640 --> 17:09.559
-Come on.

17:09.598 --> 17:11.400
I've known you since we were
five, and you have never

17:11.440 --> 17:12.598
walked out of class.

17:15.200 --> 17:18.640
-You're the last person
who would understand.

17:18.680 --> 17:20.039
-All right.

17:20.079 --> 17:21.519
Well, then, for the sake of
the exercise, pretend I'm

17:21.559 --> 17:22.759
someone else.

17:29.640 --> 17:31.440
-You want to know
what's wrong?

17:31.480 --> 17:34.400
Tell me what you see.

17:34.440 --> 17:36.440
-A really boring leotard.

17:36.480 --> 17:37.640
-Like you haven't noticed.

17:37.680 --> 17:39.559
-Honestly, you look
exactly the same.

17:39.599 --> 17:42.799
-What about these?

17:42.839 --> 17:45.480
KAT (OFFSCREEN): That's what
you're stressing about?

17:45.519 --> 17:47.599
Abigail, they don't look
any different.

17:47.640 --> 17:49.359
Anyway, I have these.

17:49.400 --> 17:51.599
I have bigger these,
thankfully.

17:51.640 --> 17:53.640
-But I've got to be a
principal dancer.

17:53.680 --> 17:54.559
And principals don't.

17:54.599 --> 17:55.839
They just don't.

17:55.880 --> 17:56.720
They're ethereal.

17:56.759 --> 17:57.480
They're like--

17:57.519 --> 17:59.640
KAT (OFFSCREEN): Who?

17:59.680 --> 18:01.759
Tara.

18:01.799 --> 18:05.039
They don't all have
flat chests.

18:05.079 --> 18:07.599
-Take--

18:07.640 --> 18:09.079
take my mum, for example.

18:09.119 --> 18:10.799
-Natasha is a genetic freak.

18:10.839 --> 18:11.960
She's one in a million.

18:12.000 --> 18:16.039
-Abby, you have spent
years stepping over

18:16.079 --> 18:18.480
everyone to get this far.

18:18.519 --> 18:21.519
Are you really gonna let a
little bit of this stop you?

18:24.480 --> 18:25.799
-You all want me to fail.

18:25.839 --> 18:27.039
This must be the funniest thing

18:27.079 --> 18:29.720
that's happened in years.

18:29.759 --> 18:33.200
-Firstly, no matter what you
do, Abigail, you are never

18:33.240 --> 18:35.200
going to be funny.

18:35.240 --> 18:38.359
And secondly, that crossover--

18:38.400 --> 18:39.640
you don't need it.

18:49.720 --> 18:51.240
SAMMY (OFFSCREEN): Hey!

18:51.279 --> 18:52.599
-Sorry.

18:52.640 --> 18:53.799
Sorry.

19:03.359 --> 19:03.799
MAN (OFFSCREEN): Hey, Tara.

19:03.839 --> 19:05.319
Tara.

19:05.359 --> 19:07.480
Is it true Damien Lang's gonna
be doing Spartacus next year?

19:07.519 --> 19:09.400
-Oh, I'm not really
allowed to say.

19:09.440 --> 19:12.799
But personally, I think it would
be a great career move

19:12.839 --> 19:13.400
for Damo.

19:13.440 --> 19:14.640
-Yeah, yeah.

19:14.680 --> 19:16.039
Cool.

19:23.680 --> 19:26.839
If we're gonna share a room, we
need to get either a lock

19:26.880 --> 19:28.160
or some sort of code
or schedule.

19:28.200 --> 19:29.079
-Shut up.

19:29.119 --> 19:30.400
-OK.

19:30.440 --> 19:32.720
-Come here.

19:32.759 --> 19:33.799
Give me a hand.

19:33.839 --> 19:34.839
Make a fist.

19:34.880 --> 19:37.559
-I don't want to fight
you, Christian.

19:37.599 --> 19:39.799
-Ah, just a minute.

19:39.839 --> 19:41.200
Come in, Christian.

19:43.279 --> 19:44.599
Brilliant.

19:44.640 --> 19:46.079
Yes.

19:46.119 --> 19:47.119
-The rumors reached
the third years.

19:47.160 --> 19:47.960
-Yeah, I know.

19:48.000 --> 19:50.319
I was just speaking to Ethan.

19:50.359 --> 19:53.200
Don't get any ideas.

19:53.240 --> 19:56.279
-OK, everyone find
their partners.

19:56.319 --> 19:57.200
Except you, Tara.

19:57.240 --> 20:00.680
Mr. Kennedy wants to see you.

20:00.720 --> 20:02.079
Get a move on.

20:14.519 --> 20:16.319
[knock at door]

20:16.359 --> 20:18.720
-Come in.

20:18.759 --> 20:21.279
Tara, I need to ask you
some questions.

20:21.319 --> 20:22.680
Damien, give us the
room, please.

20:22.720 --> 20:24.200
-I think there's been-- no,
he doesn't have to leave.

20:24.240 --> 20:25.400
MR. KENNEDY (OFFSCREEN): We
need to talk privately.

20:30.599 --> 20:34.359
A staff member has come to me
with a disturbing rumor--

20:34.400 --> 20:36.680
one that every student in the
school seems to be discussing.

20:36.720 --> 20:37.799
-But it's not his fault.

20:37.839 --> 20:39.279
It's mine.

20:39.319 --> 20:41.799
-The reason we have a policy
about students dating company

20:41.839 --> 20:44.119
members is to protect
them both.

20:44.160 --> 20:44.720
-No, no, no.

20:44.759 --> 20:46.440
It's all made up.

20:46.480 --> 20:48.200
Not by me, exactly.

20:48.240 --> 20:50.559
But see, our mothers
know each other.

20:50.599 --> 20:55.160
And some girls saw us talking,
and this rumor just took on a

20:55.200 --> 20:55.960
life of its own.

20:56.000 --> 20:57.000
And I probably could have--

20:57.039 --> 20:58.400
I definitely could have
said something.

20:58.440 --> 20:59.599
But I guess I just--

20:59.640 --> 21:00.440
I just thought--

21:00.480 --> 21:03.519
-You thought what?

21:03.559 --> 21:06.480
-I never meant it to get this
far or for anyone to get in

21:06.519 --> 21:08.000
trouble.

21:08.039 --> 21:10.839
-A story like this could ruin
Damien's career, and do yours

21:10.880 --> 21:13.160
a lot of damage, as well.

21:13.200 --> 21:15.640
I'm extremely disappointed
in you, Tara.

21:18.319 --> 21:19.400
-Damien.

21:19.440 --> 21:20.599
-I can't talk to you
anymore, all right?

21:20.640 --> 21:21.559
Just stay away from me.

21:21.599 --> 21:22.160
-Wait.

21:22.200 --> 21:22.559
Please.

21:22.599 --> 21:23.079
Stop.

21:23.119 --> 21:23.960
Please.

21:24.000 --> 21:24.799
-I explained everything
to them.

21:24.839 --> 21:25.480
-All right.

21:25.519 --> 21:27.160
Well, explain it to me.

21:27.200 --> 21:29.119
-It's stupid.

21:29.160 --> 21:31.759
There's this guy and
he's in third year.

21:31.799 --> 21:33.319
And I thought--

21:33.359 --> 21:34.799
I thought that if he knew
that someone older

21:34.839 --> 21:35.799
liked me, that he--

21:35.839 --> 21:38.640
he might see me differently.

21:38.680 --> 21:41.200
-So I just watched my career
almost get wiped out because

21:41.240 --> 21:43.759
of some stupid school
girl crush?

21:43.799 --> 21:45.119
-Sorry.

21:47.279 --> 21:49.319
-You know, when we first talked,
I thought how great it

21:49.359 --> 21:52.440
was that there was this kid at
the academy that was real.

21:52.480 --> 21:54.319
I was proud to have come from
the same place as you.

21:57.839 --> 22:00.279
You shouldn't be in such
a hurry to grow up.

22:19.240 --> 22:20.680
TARA (OFFSCREEN): I have this
image of myself when I'm like

22:20.720 --> 22:26.119
25 and I'm walking towards
a theater in Paris.

22:26.160 --> 22:29.799
I still look like me, but
I know exactly who I am.

22:29.839 --> 22:32.200
My inside finally matches
my outside.

22:43.480 --> 22:44.839
The only problem is
that's jumping to

22:44.880 --> 22:47.559
the end of the story.

22:47.599 --> 22:50.400
-Hey.

22:50.440 --> 22:51.359
-Hi.

22:51.400 --> 22:53.319
-You causing trouble again?

22:53.359 --> 22:55.799
-Some.

22:55.839 --> 22:57.559
-You know, you look better
without makeup.

23:02.480 --> 23:03.359
-Enough, Tara.

23:03.400 --> 23:04.599
You are so done.

23:07.400 --> 23:10.200
TARA (OFFSCREEN): And
you know what?

23:10.240 --> 23:13.720
If I went straight to that
theater in Paris, I'd miss out

23:13.759 --> 23:16.200
on all this other stuff I never
could have predicted.

23:37.319 --> 23:38.480
In.
