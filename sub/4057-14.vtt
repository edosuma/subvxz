00:01.016 --> 00:02.437
Previously on Teen Wolf...

00:02.462 --> 00:05.242
Eight years ago, almost an entire
family died in a car accident.

00:05.294 --> 00:07.256
A young girl named Malia was found.

00:07.281 --> 00:08.356
My daughter is still alive.

00:08.380 --> 00:09.975
I'm just going to have to kill her again.

00:09.999 --> 00:13.133
I'm going to show you how to
use your voice as a weapon.

00:13.169 --> 00:14.169
Tell me what it is?

00:14.220 --> 00:16.085
Not what it is, what it was.

00:16.138 --> 00:18.500
A monster whose only purpose was to kill.

00:18.525 --> 00:20.366
The Beast of Gevaudan.

00:45.484 --> 00:46.733
What is that?

00:46.769 --> 00:49.203
You might call it a fingerprint.

00:51.123 --> 00:53.644
This isn't going to look like
anything we've seen before, is it?

00:53.669 --> 00:56.054
Oh, there were a lot of descriptions

00:56.078 --> 00:58.328
of the Beast of Gevaudan.

00:58.380 --> 01:02.394
Everything from a red-furred giant wolf to

01:02.418 --> 01:06.253
a cloven-hoofed panther
the size of a horse.

01:06.305 --> 01:10.841
But my grandfather gave me a
description that was a bit stranger.

01:10.893 --> 01:12.392
How strange?

01:12.428 --> 01:16.408
He said the body was oil black.

01:16.432 --> 01:19.983
Solid but shapeless at the same time.

01:20.019 --> 01:23.070
Like a shadow
pretending to be real.

01:37.870 --> 01:39.453
How do we stop it?

01:39.505 --> 01:41.433
As far as legend goes,

01:41.457 --> 01:43.768
the only weapon that proved effective

01:43.792 --> 01:48.262
was a simple spear in the
hands of a young woman.

01:48.297 --> 01:50.442
The Maid of Gevaudan.

02:53.862 --> 02:55.340
That's right.

02:55.364 --> 02:57.998
I know your frequency.

02:59.201 --> 03:01.868
And I also know you're
down here for a reason.

03:03.539 --> 03:06.089
I wonder what that could be.

05:22.511 --> 05:23.977
Parrish.

05:24.930 --> 05:26.680
Parrish, look at me.

05:27.683 --> 05:29.983
I know what you're thinking.

05:30.018 --> 05:31.651
The dream's coming true.

05:31.687 --> 05:32.769
It's not.

05:32.821 --> 05:35.655
Sheriff, there's 23 bodies.

05:37.192 --> 05:38.503
Twenty-three of them.

05:38.527 --> 05:40.994
Which means you're going
to go back to the station

05:41.029 --> 05:43.007
and you're gonna go through
every missing persons report

05:43.031 --> 05:44.698
for the past two weeks.

05:44.750 --> 05:46.700
That's what we do.

05:48.287 --> 05:49.870
You got it, Parrish?

06:03.852 --> 06:05.185
Who found them?

06:06.221 --> 06:07.354
Argent.

06:07.389 --> 06:09.306
And he said the Doctors were down there.

06:09.358 --> 06:12.275
He also said you guys might
know what this thing is.

06:12.311 --> 06:13.393
We've got a theory.

06:13.445 --> 06:15.206
It's a slightly terrifying theory.

06:15.230 --> 06:18.209
Well, the ME said that victims
were killed somewhere else

06:18.233 --> 06:20.283
and then dumped in those tunnels.

06:20.319 --> 06:22.213
Hey, what if the Dread
Doctors are hiding the bodies.

06:22.237 --> 06:23.286
Why would they do that?

06:23.322 --> 06:25.155
Maybe they're covering for it.

06:25.207 --> 06:27.123
Protecting it like a parent would.

06:27.159 --> 06:29.209
Protecting what?

06:29.661 --> 06:31.044
A werewolf.

06:31.880 --> 06:33.079
It's called the Beast.

06:34.416 --> 06:35.715
We know. Horrifying.

06:35.751 --> 06:38.251
We better figure out what
we're gonna call Parrish.

06:39.388 --> 06:41.805
Because it looks like
his dream is coming true.

06:48.313 --> 06:51.097
I said use your hands.

06:51.149 --> 06:53.817
I didn't say punch the gate.

06:53.852 --> 06:57.404
Well, it's all a little new to me so,

06:57.439 --> 06:59.272
don't hold back on specificity.

06:59.324 --> 07:02.776
Your hands can guide your voice.

07:02.828 --> 07:05.946
They can help push it towards the target.

07:07.165 --> 07:08.448
Try again.

07:09.835 --> 07:11.251
How did you learn?

07:11.286 --> 07:12.597
It doesn't matter.

07:12.621 --> 07:14.588
You have to find your own way.

07:14.623 --> 07:16.540
What if your way works for me too?

07:16.592 --> 07:20.794
Lydia, find your way.

07:20.846 --> 07:23.346
But none of this is even real.

07:23.382 --> 07:24.859
My body's lying in a room down the hall

07:24.883 --> 07:25.932
staring at the ceiling.

07:34.059 --> 07:35.442
Did that feel real?

07:37.813 --> 07:38.945
What are you doing?

07:40.148 --> 07:41.281
You want out?

07:42.734 --> 07:44.701
Break the glass.

07:49.157 --> 07:50.874
It's not just glass.

07:50.909 --> 07:52.637
It's bullet-resistant polycarbonate.

07:52.661 --> 07:54.327
So make your voice a bullet.

07:55.797 --> 07:57.464
Break the glass.

08:00.752 --> 08:03.169
Break the glass.

08:04.423 --> 08:06.172
You... You're kidding, right?

08:06.224 --> 08:08.987
Look, I promised I'd help and I will.

08:09.011 --> 08:11.428
- That's supposed to help me find Deaton?
- No.

08:11.480 --> 08:14.397
Something in the Dread Doctors'
Operating Theater is going to do that.

08:14.433 --> 08:16.733
I can take you there, but I
can't let you see where it is.

08:16.768 --> 08:18.018
Ever hear of a blindfold?

08:18.070 --> 08:20.353
Not one that works on a werecoyote.

08:20.405 --> 08:22.355
- What's in it?
- Wolfsbane.

08:22.407 --> 08:24.024
The same kind they used on Liam.

08:24.076 --> 08:26.493
It won't last and there's
no permanent side effects.

08:26.528 --> 08:27.911
Why should I trust you?

08:27.946 --> 08:30.196
You shouldn't. But you will.

08:30.248 --> 08:31.831
Because the Desert Wolf could be here

08:31.867 --> 08:33.700
and Scott's boss could already be dead.

08:35.337 --> 08:37.169
You want to give Scott the bad news?

08:37.205 --> 08:39.067
You want to tell him it's
your fault Deaton's dead?

08:39.091 --> 08:41.875
Because you pretty much dared
the Desert Wolf to come after you.

08:59.695 --> 09:02.228
You're gonna have to come closer than that.

09:10.489 --> 09:11.538
Closer.

09:30.175 --> 09:31.257
Do it.

09:41.998 --> 09:43.380
By order of the Sheriff,

09:43.416 --> 09:46.417
a county-wide curfew goes
into effect tonight at sundown.

09:46.469 --> 09:48.219
All after-school activities are canceled

09:48.254 --> 09:49.553
until further notice.

09:49.589 --> 09:53.007
Students should go directly home
at the end of the school day.

10:12.528 --> 10:14.912
You don't think this is a
bit much in terms of firepower

10:14.947 --> 10:16.003
for a high school?

10:16.028 --> 10:17.843
Your Dad's the one that
issued us these things,

10:17.867 --> 10:19.366
and he wouldn't officially say why.

10:20.703 --> 10:22.503
Did he say anything unofficially?

10:22.538 --> 10:23.826
No. But everyone's got a theory.

10:23.851 --> 10:24.818
What's yours?

10:24.843 --> 10:26.393
I shouldn't be talking to you
guys. Don't you have class?

10:26.417 --> 10:29.093
Come on, Strauss. What's your theory?

10:34.800 --> 10:36.517
Do you guys believe in the supernatural?

10:43.943 --> 10:45.871
Dad, are you sure about this?

10:45.895 --> 10:48.373
I mean, how am I supposed to
help my friends if I can't fight?

10:48.397 --> 10:49.730
You still know how to fight.

10:49.782 --> 10:51.282
But I'm better with a sword.

10:51.317 --> 10:53.545
Then, as a teacher and a lover of history,

10:53.569 --> 10:55.394
maybe I can inspire you with a quote.

10:55.419 --> 10:56.736
Oh, God.

10:56.761 --> 10:59.239
Napoleon said, "There are
only two forces in the world,

10:59.292 --> 11:01.408
"the sword and the spirit.

11:01.460 --> 11:02.721
"In the long run,

11:02.745 --> 11:05.379
"the sword will always be
conquered by the spirit."

11:05.414 --> 11:07.726
I thought it was the spirit
I was trying to conquer.

11:07.750 --> 11:09.728
Your spirit, Kira.

11:09.752 --> 11:12.564
You're still stronger than
the Fox. Remember that.

11:12.588 --> 11:14.672
But I'm useless without a weapon.

11:14.724 --> 11:16.185
I'm useless to my friends.

11:16.210 --> 11:17.591
You always have a weapon.

11:17.643 --> 11:19.677
The most powerful weapon of all.

11:19.729 --> 11:21.478
If you tap me on the forehead and say,

11:21.514 --> 11:24.181
"Your mind is your most powerful
weapon," I'm going to scream.

11:24.233 --> 11:26.266
I wasn't going to tap you on the forehead.

11:26.319 --> 11:27.412
But...

11:27.436 --> 11:29.687
The sword is a gateway to the Fox.

11:29.739 --> 11:31.322
And the Fox is too dangerous.

11:36.779 --> 11:38.829
Your mind is a weapon, Kira.

11:38.864 --> 11:40.247
Trust yourself.

11:41.000 --> 11:43.417
You can outfox the Fox.

12:12.481 --> 12:14.481
What the hell's this?

12:15.818 --> 12:17.284
Safety first.

12:18.537 --> 12:20.821
I said I'd help you find the Desert Wolf.

12:21.907 --> 12:23.907
I didn't say it was gonna be easy.

12:23.959 --> 12:26.039
The restraints are to keep
you from hurting yourself.

12:28.831 --> 12:29.880
Or me.

12:34.420 --> 12:36.970
Oh, come on.

12:37.006 --> 12:40.140
This is what the Dread Doctors
used to keep track of the Chimeras.

12:40.176 --> 12:42.810
It seeks out and hones
in on a certain frequency.

12:42.845 --> 12:45.254
They gave the Chimeras
their own unique vibration.

12:45.279 --> 12:47.398
So how is that going
to help me find Deaton?

12:47.433 --> 12:48.496
It won't.

12:48.851 --> 12:50.491
It's going to help you find a werecoyote.

12:51.771 --> 12:53.165
My mother.

12:53.189 --> 12:55.856
Because supernatural creatures
also have their own frequency.

12:58.444 --> 12:59.755
What, you're going to teach me physics?

12:59.779 --> 13:01.673
Or are you going to put your
little torture device on my head

13:01.697 --> 13:03.914
and get this thing started?

13:03.949 --> 13:07.418
You have to concentrate on
exactly who you want to find.

13:07.453 --> 13:10.215
You have to make a
connection to a memory of her.

13:10.240 --> 13:11.789
I don't remember a thing about her.

13:11.841 --> 13:13.507
Then think about something else.

13:13.542 --> 13:15.759
Think about the crash.

13:15.795 --> 13:17.522
Think about the gun firing at the car.

13:17.546 --> 13:19.430
Anything that brings you back.

13:22.685 --> 13:24.435
This is gonna hurt.

13:25.137 --> 13:26.520
I don't care.

13:42.705 --> 13:43.737
Don't close your eyes.

13:43.789 --> 13:44.822
Keep them open.

13:44.874 --> 13:46.490
I can't.

13:46.542 --> 13:47.741
I can't.

13:48.410 --> 13:49.554
It hurts.

13:49.578 --> 13:50.578
Open them.

13:51.580 --> 13:54.081
Malia, open your eyes.

13:59.672 --> 14:01.588
The full moon, I'm telling you...

14:01.640 --> 14:03.257
It has to be the full moon.

14:10.766 --> 14:12.015
I know where she is.

14:12.067 --> 14:13.100
She's here.

14:14.603 --> 14:16.436
She's in Beacon Hills.

14:29.788 --> 14:31.466
I need you to tell Scott something for me.

14:31.490 --> 14:33.707
Yeah, uh, why me?

14:33.742 --> 14:35.125
Because I can't right now.

14:35.160 --> 14:36.626
You gonna do it or not?

14:36.662 --> 14:38.640
Uh, he's not really talking to me.

14:38.664 --> 14:39.963
You should get someone else.

14:39.998 --> 14:41.665
Literally anyone else.

14:43.135 --> 14:44.813
Just tell him he was
right about the tunnels.

14:44.837 --> 14:46.314
Just tell him that, okay?

14:46.338 --> 14:47.721
What do you mean?

14:47.756 --> 14:50.140
When we were down there
looking for you and Hayden,

14:50.175 --> 14:53.727
we didn't know it yet, but we
were a lot closer than we thought.

14:53.762 --> 14:55.490
There's an Operating Theater down there.

14:55.514 --> 14:56.680
Down in the tunnels.

14:57.399 --> 14:58.565
How do you know?

14:58.600 --> 15:01.151
Mostly by scent. Just tell him, okay?

15:02.070 --> 15:03.653
Tell Scott he was right.

15:12.197 --> 15:14.364
What's the problem?

15:14.416 --> 15:16.416
Besides the fact that
I've never seen this place

15:16.451 --> 15:18.034
beyond a few aerial photos

15:18.086 --> 15:20.170
and we're basically going in blind?

15:21.222 --> 15:22.363
Him.

15:23.458 --> 15:25.458
Would you mind not
pointing that thing at me?

15:25.510 --> 15:27.021
He's coming with us.

15:27.045 --> 15:28.678
He tried to kill Scott.

15:28.714 --> 15:30.547
Technically, I did kill Scott.

15:30.599 --> 15:31.631
I should kill you.

15:31.683 --> 15:32.861
Won't happen with a shotgun.

15:32.885 --> 15:35.530
Stop. Both of you.

15:35.554 --> 15:37.354
I did what I had to do to survive.

15:37.389 --> 15:38.950
The Dread Doctors wanted everybody dead.

15:38.974 --> 15:41.035
I convinced them that
it could just be Scott.

15:41.059 --> 15:42.609
You could still tell Scott.

15:42.644 --> 15:43.872
When we have Deaton back.

15:43.896 --> 15:46.396
He's not going to blame you
for the Desert Wolf taking him.

15:46.448 --> 15:48.782
But he might stop me from killing her.

15:48.817 --> 15:49.866
Theo won't.

15:49.902 --> 15:51.368
Actually, I'm planning to help.

15:51.403 --> 15:52.547
Don't be so confident.

15:52.571 --> 15:55.038
She's known to carry
pretty heavy firepower.

15:55.073 --> 15:57.574
But, what do werecoyote need with guns?

15:57.626 --> 15:59.209
There's a story.

15:59.244 --> 16:00.794
I don't know all the details,

16:00.829 --> 16:03.213
but something happened a long time ago.

16:03.248 --> 16:05.415
Somehow, she lost part of her power.

16:05.467 --> 16:07.884
She's not as fast or as
strong as she used to be.

16:07.920 --> 16:09.753
But she can still pull a trigger,

16:11.056 --> 16:12.088
and she's a perfect shot.

16:15.761 --> 16:17.928
The sun's going down. We need to go.

16:18.597 --> 16:20.230
Are you coming or not?

17:23.494 --> 17:24.828
You lost?

17:26.748 --> 17:28.131
Completely.

17:29.668 --> 17:31.801
How did you know I was down here?

17:31.837 --> 17:32.886
I followed you.

17:34.139 --> 17:35.483
Why are you following me?

17:35.507 --> 17:37.640
Why are you down here?

17:37.676 --> 17:40.036
I'm just trying to figure out
if this is where they took us.

17:40.395 --> 17:41.594
Me and Hayden.

17:41.646 --> 17:43.346
Malia said she was down here too.

17:43.398 --> 17:45.482
That the scent was the same.

17:45.517 --> 17:47.350
She said you were right.

17:50.689 --> 17:52.739
Uh, there's a turn you keep passing.

17:52.774 --> 17:54.357
It's easy to miss.

17:56.411 --> 17:58.495
How many times did you watch me pass it?

17:59.247 --> 18:00.497
Five.

18:03.869 --> 18:06.252
Come on. Let's see if
we can find it together.

18:08.040 --> 18:11.458
No guards. No lights.

18:11.510 --> 18:13.259
This place looks completely abandoned.

18:13.295 --> 18:15.011
That should be easier for us, right?

18:15.047 --> 18:16.129
Not necessarily.

18:16.181 --> 18:18.131
Especially if she knows we're coming.

18:18.183 --> 18:20.028
You're sure this is the place you saw?

18:20.052 --> 18:21.551
Unless there's another Fort Jewett.

18:21.603 --> 18:22.886
Maybe she left.

18:23.889 --> 18:25.555
Maybe Deaton's already gone.

18:25.607 --> 18:28.369
I'm not walking away on a maybe.

18:28.393 --> 18:30.977
And I'm not walking in
on so much uncertainty.

18:31.029 --> 18:33.029
You said you've been after her for years.

18:33.065 --> 18:35.115
And why do you think it's been years?

18:35.150 --> 18:37.617
Because she knows what she's doing.

18:37.652 --> 18:39.819
She took Scott's boss for a reason.

18:39.871 --> 18:41.382
We don't know what it is.

18:41.406 --> 18:43.051
We don't know if she's back in Beacon Hills

18:43.075 --> 18:44.385
because she's missed you all this time

18:44.409 --> 18:46.387
and can't wait for a
mother-daughter reunion

18:46.411 --> 18:49.223
or if she's planning to
put a bullet in your head.

18:49.247 --> 18:50.497
We don't know anything.

18:50.549 --> 18:51.714
We know one thing.

18:51.750 --> 18:53.249
We know where she is.

18:54.803 --> 18:56.086
I'm going in.

18:56.138 --> 18:57.138
I have to.

19:07.849 --> 19:09.599
Meredith, please.

19:09.651 --> 19:12.018
Tell me how you did it.

19:12.070 --> 19:14.604
You have to find your own way.

19:15.407 --> 19:16.940
Why can't you tell me yours?

19:18.160 --> 19:21.244
Because, my way got people hurt.

19:22.581 --> 19:25.865
Some days it was quiet for me.

19:25.917 --> 19:29.452
Other days, all I could hear was screaming.

19:30.038 --> 19:31.588
People dying.

19:33.542 --> 19:34.791
What people?

19:36.545 --> 19:38.094
Everyone.

19:38.130 --> 19:39.462
Everywhere.

19:40.215 --> 19:41.631
I was at Chemistry class

19:41.683 --> 19:42.765
when it happened.

19:42.801 --> 19:45.468
I had my hands over my ears.

19:45.520 --> 19:49.283
The teacher was trying to
figure out what was wrong.

19:49.307 --> 19:52.286
I took my hands and I
started hitting the desk,

19:52.310 --> 19:53.810
until I couldn't take it anymore

19:53.862 --> 19:55.645
and I just screamed.

19:55.697 --> 19:56.980
What happened?

19:58.817 --> 20:01.868
All of the windows shattered.

20:01.903 --> 20:05.633
I saw kids with glass in their arms,

20:05.657 --> 20:08.158
in their faces.

20:08.210 --> 20:12.378
Some of them had blood
coming out of their ears.

20:12.414 --> 20:14.330
They said it was an explosion...

20:15.500 --> 20:17.500
Caused by chemicals.

20:18.637 --> 20:20.553
But everyone knew it was me.

20:25.260 --> 20:28.011
Find a better way, Lydia.

20:28.930 --> 20:30.730
My voice is like

20:30.765 --> 20:32.482
a bomb going off.

20:33.485 --> 20:36.019
Yours needs to be a bullet.

20:40.775 --> 20:42.358
Did you hear that?

20:55.876 --> 20:57.075
Malia?

20:59.146 --> 21:00.312
Malia!

21:07.269 --> 21:08.885
Is this real? Or is it in my head?

21:09.437 --> 21:10.687
I think you know

21:10.722 --> 21:13.056
what a Banshee premonition feels like.

21:19.981 --> 21:21.698
She's going to die.

21:41.963 --> 21:46.382
Your teachers, uh, gave us some
of the stuff you guys have been working on.

21:46.434 --> 21:49.519
They wanted us to hold on to it for you.

21:49.554 --> 21:51.804
I saw something about the, uh,

21:51.856 --> 21:53.606
Riemann Hypothesis.

21:54.776 --> 21:56.442
Um, things like,

21:56.478 --> 21:59.028
nontrivial zeros,

21:59.064 --> 22:00.947
zeta functions

22:00.982 --> 22:04.234
and a lot of other stuff that
goes totally over my head.

22:08.707 --> 22:11.207
Maybe you can wake up and explain it to me?

22:18.917 --> 22:20.416
Oh, come on, Lydia.

22:20.468 --> 22:22.418
You have to come back to us.

22:25.056 --> 22:27.807
There's no way we're getting
through this without you.

22:29.477 --> 22:31.594
Lydia, you have to wake up.

22:33.348 --> 22:35.565
I think that's enough.

22:37.652 --> 22:38.985
Stiles.

22:44.409 --> 22:45.575
Wait a second, what is this?

22:48.697 --> 22:50.830
What are they doing? All
right, you need to go.

22:52.083 --> 22:53.094
They shaved her head.

22:53.118 --> 22:55.285
Look at it. Did you...
Did you know about this?

22:55.337 --> 22:56.897
What are they gonna do?
Drill a hole into her head?

22:56.921 --> 22:58.087
Are you crazy?

23:00.875 --> 23:02.125
It's for E-C-T.

23:02.177 --> 23:03.843
Electroconvulsive therapy.

23:05.096 --> 23:07.213
They shave small portions of the scalp.

23:07.265 --> 23:10.099
It's done under general
anesthesia and it's perfectly safe.

23:11.436 --> 23:13.102
Look at her, Stiles.

23:13.138 --> 23:14.971
She's my daughter.

23:15.023 --> 23:18.119
You don't think I'm trying everything
I can to bring her out of this?

23:18.143 --> 23:20.393
No, no, no, that's not E-C-T.

23:20.445 --> 23:21.811
Is everything all right in here?

23:21.863 --> 23:23.696
It's fine.

23:23.732 --> 23:25.365
Our guest is just leaving.

23:26.901 --> 23:28.701
Stiles, go.

23:28.737 --> 23:30.119
Or you're not coming back.

23:39.914 --> 23:42.715
All right, Lydia, time for your shower.

23:50.475 --> 23:51.507
Sorry.

24:11.746 --> 24:12.995
Do you feel that?

24:13.031 --> 24:15.331
Like something's vibrating.

24:15.367 --> 24:17.033
I can't tell where it's coming from.

24:23.758 --> 24:25.174
It's coming from everywhere.

24:35.437 --> 24:38.388
I was just trying to do something right.

24:38.440 --> 24:40.356
You do a lot right.

24:40.392 --> 24:42.525
Yeah, but I did one thing really wrong.

24:43.144 --> 24:44.477
Hayden's alive.

24:44.529 --> 24:46.006
Everything before that doesn't matter.

24:46.030 --> 24:47.063
It should.

24:48.450 --> 24:51.534
I feel like I had to do
more than just say sorry.

24:52.570 --> 24:54.537
Actually, you still haven't done that.

24:55.990 --> 24:57.373
Back at my old school...

24:59.127 --> 25:00.460
At Devenford,

25:02.247 --> 25:04.297
I got into a fight with this kid.

25:04.332 --> 25:06.394
I knocked two of his teeth out.

25:06.418 --> 25:09.135
They made me write a letter of apology.

25:09.170 --> 25:11.471
We both knew it meant nothing.

25:11.506 --> 25:13.673
We both knew that sooner or later,

25:13.725 --> 25:15.141
we're gonna get into another fight.

25:19.097 --> 25:21.397
I can't just say I'm sorry.

25:21.433 --> 25:23.566
I feel like I have to do something.

25:23.601 --> 25:26.319
Like maybe, somehow I
have to save your life.

25:34.112 --> 25:35.578
Don't worry.

25:35.613 --> 25:37.613
I'm pretty sure you'll get a chance.

25:40.418 --> 25:41.784
Well, not down here.

25:43.121 --> 25:45.087
We've been walking around for hours

25:45.123 --> 25:46.183
and all we've been able to find is

25:46.207 --> 25:47.807
some stupid snake sculpture on the wall.

25:56.301 --> 25:57.683
You think it's important?

27:04.252 --> 27:05.334
You didn't.

27:06.754 --> 27:08.004
I had to.

27:15.880 --> 27:17.713
Hello, Scott.

27:21.769 --> 27:24.720
I haven't seen that color on you.

27:26.524 --> 27:28.024
It suits you.

27:31.696 --> 27:32.862
Who's the old guy?

27:34.449 --> 27:37.044
Uh, at the moment, uh,

27:37.068 --> 27:39.285
they would call me a necessary evil.

27:40.204 --> 27:41.904
But you can call me Gerard.

27:43.575 --> 27:44.707
What were you thinking?

27:44.742 --> 27:47.159
That we need him. GERARD: He's right.

27:47.211 --> 27:50.663
If you want to catch a werewolf
like the Beast of Gevaudan,

27:50.715 --> 27:52.395
you're going to need more than one Argent.

27:54.586 --> 27:56.085
He knows all the stories.

27:56.137 --> 27:57.587
All the folklore.

27:57.639 --> 27:59.972
Everything written and
everything passed down.

28:02.927 --> 28:04.760
You sure about this?

28:06.764 --> 28:08.097
Take a look.

28:14.656 --> 28:17.273
The one on the right
is the Beast of Gevaudan.

28:18.526 --> 28:19.942
Do you know what the other one is?

28:22.997 --> 28:24.630
The Hellhound.

28:24.655 --> 28:26.699
The guardian of supernatural places.

28:26.751 --> 28:28.534
They're both creatures of the night.

28:28.586 --> 28:31.837
But you may know them as
ordinary people during the day.

28:31.873 --> 28:34.122
And most likely neither
of them know what they are.

28:37.795 --> 28:39.595
What is it?

28:39.631 --> 28:41.430
We found a message in Latin...

28:43.635 --> 28:45.518
Damnatio Memoriae.

28:49.440 --> 28:52.358
They want it to remember itself.

28:54.896 --> 28:55.956
That might give us time.

28:55.980 --> 28:57.196
Time for what?

28:57.899 --> 28:59.031
To prevent this.

29:19.480 --> 29:20.480
Who are they?

29:23.224 --> 29:24.224
Us.

29:24.939 --> 29:26.638
It's all of us.

29:48.670 --> 29:50.087
There's something wrong.

29:52.307 --> 29:53.974
Is it a scent?

29:54.760 --> 29:55.926
I don't know.

30:36.135 --> 30:38.051
It was me, wasn't it?

30:38.103 --> 30:39.352
You picked up a Chemosignal.

30:40.556 --> 30:42.022
Probably regret.

30:43.475 --> 30:44.869
Because I didn't really want to do this.

30:44.893 --> 30:46.476
But I didn't have a choice.

31:13.005 --> 31:14.671
You should've listened to Braeden.

31:30.656 --> 31:33.835
I was part of an E-O-D
team in Afghanistan.

31:33.859 --> 31:36.243
Explosive Ordinance Disposal.

31:36.278 --> 31:37.744
We handled I-E-D's.

31:39.531 --> 31:41.248
And what about before that?

31:41.283 --> 31:42.699
High school.

31:49.791 --> 31:51.186
What's that supposed to be?

31:51.210 --> 31:53.009
Werewolf? GERARD: No.

31:53.045 --> 31:54.211
It's called a Hellhound.

32:05.140 --> 32:07.057
What else do you remember from Afghanistan?

32:17.452 --> 32:19.380
You said you came to Beacon Hills

32:19.404 --> 32:21.404
because you felt drawn here.

32:32.251 --> 32:35.385
You hid the bodies of the Chimeras.

32:35.420 --> 32:37.587
You've got a resistance to fire.

32:39.975 --> 32:41.758
No, wait!

32:55.857 --> 32:57.585
We were wondering

32:57.609 --> 33:01.494
just how flame retardant are you, Deputy?

33:02.681 --> 33:04.150
What the hell are you doing?

33:27.505 --> 33:28.505
Hellhound.

33:31.526 --> 33:32.892
And what if you were wrong?

33:32.945 --> 33:34.205
Would you have burned my eye out?

33:34.229 --> 33:35.445
Yeah.

33:36.315 --> 33:37.530
This guy's your father?

33:38.317 --> 33:39.699
Wasn't my choice.

33:44.206 --> 33:46.289
All right, you've had
long enough. Let's go.

33:47.125 --> 33:49.659
I'm not buying the catatonic act.

33:50.662 --> 33:52.629
I know you can hear me.

34:00.973 --> 34:02.839
Don't get lost, Lydia.

34:04.593 --> 34:08.143
You can help them, but you
have to get out of here first.

34:08.179 --> 34:09.179
She's in trouble.

34:10.098 --> 34:11.731
I think it's happening now.

34:13.735 --> 34:15.685
You know,
your real name isn't Malia...

34:15.737 --> 34:17.353
Oh, God.

34:18.523 --> 34:20.572
She found her.

34:22.494 --> 34:24.360
You don't have a name.

34:24.413 --> 34:26.862
Talia Hale took you away from
me before I could give you one.

34:31.920 --> 34:33.370
What you do have is power.

34:34.373 --> 34:37.185
Strength, speed, and the capacity to heal.

34:37.208 --> 34:38.875
You know where you got it from, Malia?

34:38.927 --> 34:40.688
You know who you stole it from?

34:40.712 --> 34:41.844
Me.

34:45.266 --> 34:46.882
Tell me when it hurts.

34:49.721 --> 34:51.438
Tell me when it really hurts.

34:57.479 --> 34:58.528
Corinne!

34:59.564 --> 35:01.481
You can't get it back like this.

35:01.533 --> 35:02.732
It has to be a full moon.

35:02.784 --> 35:04.567
You kill her now and you get nothing.

35:08.407 --> 35:09.407
You can help her!

35:10.742 --> 35:12.375
Lydia!

35:19.918 --> 35:21.885
Lydia!

35:22.838 --> 35:24.254
Break the glass.

35:26.258 --> 35:28.591
Break the glass!

36:24.104 --> 36:26.188
I killed them because of you.

36:26.240 --> 36:27.584
I killed my own family.

36:27.608 --> 36:29.419
Your adopted family.

36:29.443 --> 36:31.076
I'm your family, sweetheart.

36:57.604 --> 36:59.521
But if it makes you feel any better,

36:59.556 --> 37:00.722
I didn't care about them.

37:00.774 --> 37:02.140
I was just trying to kill you.

37:26.917 --> 37:28.500
Please, I have to tell them.

37:29.720 --> 37:31.336
They're all going to die.

37:33.724 --> 37:35.140
My friends.

37:36.727 --> 37:38.310
They're all going to die.

37:43.484 --> 37:44.484
Malia...

38:10.594 --> 38:11.594
Come on!

38:38.739 --> 38:41.540
All this to take down one blind werewolf.

38:43.627 --> 38:46.211
Recently re-blinded.

38:47.331 --> 38:49.047
Unfortunately,

38:49.082 --> 38:53.730
the healing of my eyes by a
Dark Druid proved only temporary.

38:53.754 --> 38:57.088
A parting gift from my
time with Scott McCall.

38:58.008 --> 38:59.257
Friend of yours?

38:59.309 --> 39:00.892
We're working through some issues.

39:01.795 --> 39:03.595
He knows why he's here.

39:04.014 --> 39:05.764
He knows about the Beast.

39:07.317 --> 39:09.434
The Beast of Gevaudan.

39:10.737 --> 39:14.155
History's most vicious,
most famous werewolf.

39:16.026 --> 39:20.278
And you think I'm going to
show you how to steal its power.

39:26.420 --> 39:28.736
I think you're open to negotiation.

39:30.257 --> 39:32.674
All you have to do is
tell me what you want.

39:34.011 --> 39:35.794
I want his eyes.

39:36.630 --> 39:38.263
On the tips of my claws.

39:41.852 --> 39:45.549
I want the eyes of Scott McCall.

41:09.856 --> 41:11.056
Now we get Lydia.
