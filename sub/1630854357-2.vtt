- It's Gail.

02:08.128 --> 02:10.171
- Has she heard anything?

02:12.090 --> 02:14.092
- She's offered to pick up
the kids for school

02:14.134 --> 02:15.635
since B's not here.

02:15.677 --> 02:18.722
That is very thoughtful
of you, Gail.

02:18.763 --> 02:20.765

You know, the boys have
the spirit of mischief

about Jan and B?

02:30.150 --> 02:32.777

<i>But the manager at</i>

02:37.407 --> 02:40.493
inside the unit
we couldn't see last night,

02:40.535 --> 02:42.620

02:51.880 --> 02:53.214
<i>- I will.</i>

02:55.342 --> 02:57.510
- You know what?

02:57.552 --> 03:00.805
How about I head
to Brigham City myself? Huh?

03:00.847 --> 03:02.557
<i>- Oh, Bob,</i>
<i>don't drive all that way.</i>

03:02.599 --> 03:05.935
He'll probably just pull
up here the minute you leave.

03:05.977 --> 03:08.188
- Oh, it's no trouble.
I'll leave right now.

03:08.229 --> 03:12.108
You hurry back and park
yourself at home, all right?

03:12.150 --> 03:13.985
<i>In case he calls.</i>

03:14.027 --> 03:15.737
- Suit yourself.

03:15.779 --> 03:17.238
- Bye now.

03:18.573 --> 03:20.450
- You hardly ate.
Can I make you a sandwich?

03:20.492 --> 03:22.369
- I'm not that hungry.

03:24.704 --> 03:26.790

Okay.

You're bleeding.

- I am?

06:01.820 --> 06:03.571
Oh.

06:11.579 --> 06:13.623
I remember driving.

06:15.834 --> 06:21.339
And the instrument cluster
on the car going crazy.

06:21.381 --> 06:22.966
And I stopped.

06:24.843 --> 06:27.137
And that's when I saw them.

06:27.178 --> 06:29.723
- Saw who?

06:29.764 --> 06:32.183
- These lights in a--

06:32.225 --> 06:35.562
in a circle,
and they're right overhead.

06:35.603 --> 06:38.064
And they came down
right beside us.

06:39.858 --> 06:43.153
And that's when a couple
of them emerged.

06:43.194 --> 06:46.573
And they came, and they
pulled me out of the car.

06:46.614 --> 06:48.450
And then they held me
by my arms.

06:53.246 --> 06:55.665
- They didn't look--

06:57.459 --> 07:00.545
they didn't look
strange or funny at all.

07:00.587 --> 07:03.840
I guess they can look
like regular people.

07:03.882 --> 07:06.634
I said to them, I said,
"What do you want?"

07:15.727 --> 07:17.771
And they said you.

07:20.023 --> 07:22.400
And I--

07:22.442 --> 07:25.487
I tried to fight 'em off.

07:25.528 --> 07:27.906
They were just too strong,
and then they overpowered me,

07:27.947 --> 07:31.576
and then I--I blacked out.

07:31.618 --> 07:35.914
Next thing I know,
you're waking me up here.

07:39.459 --> 07:40.877
Hey.

07:47.175 --> 07:48.718
What is it?

07:49.761 --> 07:52.097
- They--they talked to me.

07:53.848 --> 07:56.434
They said their names were
Zada and Zethra.

07:56.476 --> 07:58.561
- [sighs]

07:58.603 --> 08:00.563
And what do they want?

08:00.605 --> 08:04.275
- They said they need me
to save their planet.

08:04.317 --> 08:07.028
- They--they chose me.

08:07.070 --> 08:08.488
- But why you?

08:08.530 --> 08:10.657
- They said...

08:10.699 --> 08:14.661
my mom is my real mom,

08:14.703 --> 08:18.665
but my real dad is one of them.

08:20.208 --> 08:21.876
Their leader.

08:23.712 --> 08:26.256
- How do they expect you
to save them?

08:26.297 --> 08:29.801
- They said I need to meet
the male companion.

08:33.430 --> 08:35.140
And I think that's you.

08:38.893 --> 08:41.771
- [sighs] My head is spinning.

08:41.813 --> 08:44.858
- They said
that they'd be watching me,

08:44.899 --> 08:47.944
and terrible things
would happen

08:47.986 --> 08:50.864
if I didn't complete
the mission.

08:50.905 --> 08:53.700
Like, Karen would go blind,

08:53.742 --> 08:56.786
and Susan would have
to take my place

08:56.828 --> 09:01.499
because she's part alien, too.

09:01.541 --> 09:05.670
And they'd vaporize
my eternal soul.

09:05.712 --> 09:07.547
- Oh, honey.

09:07.589 --> 09:11.217
Oh. Oh, oh, oh.

Hey.

Hey, it's okay.

09:15.430 --> 09:18.141
Oh, I'm scared, too.

09:18.183 --> 09:19.976
I'm scared, too.

09:20.018 --> 09:21.603
Hey.

09:25.690 --> 09:27.067
Here's what I know.

09:29.361 --> 09:32.238
These people...

09:32.280 --> 09:34.532
they exist,

09:34.574 --> 09:37.410
and we have to do
what they say.

09:37.452 --> 09:40.038
Whether they're people like you
and me from another planet

09:40.080 --> 09:45.585
or angels
or whatever they are,

09:45.627 --> 09:46.961
we gotta do it.

09:48.963 --> 09:51.174
But you know what else
this means?

09:56.304 --> 09:58.223
It means you're special.

10:00.392 --> 10:02.811
I always knew you were,

10:02.852 --> 10:05.146
but I guess I just never knew
how special.

10:07.774 --> 10:09.317
I don't know
how we'll get through this.

10:12.904 --> 10:15.657
But I am just so glad it's you,

it's one big misunderstanding.

There was no motorhome.

Driver's side window
was broken

cut their hand

that he faked it?

15:31.973 --> 15:34.184

I wonder?

15:39.314 --> 15:41.274

Hey, I just need five minutes,

16:15.767 --> 16:17.686
And play nice.

I'm sorry

he's not gonna get it

bring him home.

17:06.568 --> 17:09.487
Mrs. Berchtold,
the longer he's out there

17:09.529 --> 17:11.740
with Jan Broberg,
the worse this gets.

17:13.408 --> 17:16.536
So is there anything
that you remember?

17:16.578 --> 17:18.163
Anything at all?

17:21.374 --> 17:22.667
- Are you aware of Berchtold

17:22.709 --> 17:24.252

your daughter drugs?

17:24.294 --> 17:28.048
- Oh, goodness, no.
- She's 12.

17:28.089 --> 17:29.632
Why?

17:29.674 --> 17:31.801
His wife saw him emptying
medicine capsules

17:31.843 --> 17:33.386
into the toilet last week.

17:33.428 --> 17:35.221
- Did he ever give Jan
any pills?

17:35.263 --> 17:37.515
- He gave us allergy pills
for Jan

17:37.557 --> 17:40.185
so she could go
horseback riding.

17:40.226 --> 17:41.895

- That'd be us.
- In private.

18:22.560 --> 18:24.270
- Sure.

that's the psychiatrist

- Well, actually, I'm just--

19:22.871 --> 19:25.331
I'm just hearing the word
for the first time myself.

19:25.373 --> 19:29.252
Apparently it's a condition

19:29.294 --> 19:34.174
where an adult man develops
a fixation

19:34.215 --> 19:35.383
on young girls.

19:35.425 --> 19:37.177
- Fixation?

19:37.218 --> 19:39.721
- Like, he's obsessed.

19:39.763 --> 19:42.140
And Dr. Milstein says
your friend Berchtold

19:42.182 --> 19:44.309
may have this condition.

19:44.351 --> 19:45.685
- What's the treatment?

19:45.727 --> 19:48.271
- What do you mean, obsessed?

- I honestly don't know.

Hello, Mrs. Berchtold.

31:58.835 --> 32:00.962
Where's Bob?

32:01.004 --> 32:02.756
He's in Wyoming.

32:02.797 --> 32:04.507
- Why is he in Wyoming?

32:04.549 --> 32:08.887
- A psychic told his uncle
that Jan might be there, so--

32:08.928 --> 32:10.430
- Bob doesn't believe
in all that,

32:10.472 --> 32:13.308
but he thought
it couldn't hurt to check.

32:13.350 --> 32:15.560
- Well, we'll have to proceed
without him.

32:17.979 --> 32:21.149

There's a dozen phone lines
at the dealership.

32:23.318 --> 32:25.862
Berchtold must have known
that we couldn't tap them all.

32:25.904 --> 32:28.698
All that Joe would say
is that Berchtold told him

32:28.740 --> 32:30.992
Jan was safe.

32:31.910 --> 32:34.996
Joe doesn't trust the FBI,
so I would like you, Mary Ann,

32:35.038 --> 32:36.664
to call Joe and see
if you can't get him

32:36.706 --> 32:39.000
to talk about his conversation
with his brother.

32:39.042 --> 32:42.003
- You think that if he knew
how broken up we are about Jan,

32:42.045 --> 32:44.172
he might help us more?

32:44.214 --> 32:46.675

33:18.331 --> 33:20.667
- He just said
that Jan was safe. That's all.

Look, I'm not looking to get
mixed up into any of this.

Did Bob say anything

33:49.946 --> 33:52.699
about leaving us money?

33:52.741 --> 33:55.744
- Uh, no, nothing
about that either, Gail.

33:55.785 --> 33:58.538
- It's just,
I have all these bills here.

33:58.580 --> 34:00.123

some help.

34:00.165 --> 34:01.624

42:51.738 --> 42:53.990
It's okay. It's okay.

42:54.032 --> 42:56.201
It's okay, Dolly.
It's you and me.

43:25.605 --> 43:27.148

43:29.025 --> 43:30.402
Dolly, can you hear me?

43:32.112 --> 43:34.239
Doll--
<i>- Silencio.</i>

43:35.615 --> 43:37.283
- Okay.

43:47.210 --> 43:49.796
- Sir? Officer?

43:49.838 --> 43:51.506
- [speaking Spanish]

43:51.548 --> 43:53.174
<i>Silencio.</i>

43:53.758 --> 43:56.302
- Hey.

43:56.344 --> 43:57.846
Two minutes.

44:03.643 --> 44:05.020
<i>- Vamos.</i>

44:15.864 --> 44:18.700
- Hey.
- B!

44:18.742 --> 44:20.285
- Hey.
- Are you okay?

44:20.326 --> 44:21.578
Did they hurt you?
- Did you let

44:21.619 --> 44:23.079
that man touch your arm?

44:24.539 --> 44:26.541
- No.
- All right, good.

44:26.583 --> 44:28.043
Do you remember what they said?

44:28.084 --> 44:30.170
You are not to have any contact

44:30.211 --> 44:32.589
with any man
other than your male companion.

44:32.630 --> 44:33.965
All right?

44:34.007 --> 44:36.968
And that goes for you so-called
father on Earth.

44:37.010 --> 44:38.720
That's especially for Bob.

44:43.892 --> 44:45.852
You gotta remember, okay?

44:45.894 --> 44:48.938
You're different.
You're special.

44:48.980 --> 44:51.191
All right,
you're not like the other kids.

44:51.232 --> 44:52.734
Okay?

44:52.776 --> 44:54.986
Come here. Come over here.

44:58.198 --> 44:59.908
Do you remember
how we talked about

44:59.949 --> 45:01.868
at some point
there would come a time

45:01.910 --> 45:04.371
where we would both be tested?

45:04.412 --> 45:06.414
- Yes.

45:06.456 --> 45:08.625
- That time has come.

45:08.667 --> 45:10.418
- What's gonna happen?

45:10.460 --> 45:11.753
What are we gonna do?

45:11.795 --> 45:16.049
- Well, you don't want them
to make Karen blind,

45:16.091 --> 45:18.843
and you don't want them to send
a new companion, do you?

45:18.885 --> 45:20.303
- No.
- Okay.

45:20.345 --> 45:21.554
[thud]
- [shouting in Spanish]

45:21.596 --> 45:23.556
- Okay, okay.

45:23.598 --> 45:27.185
Then your dedication
to the mission cannot waver.

45:27.227 --> 45:29.145
We don't have a lot of time.

45:29.187 --> 45:33.149
So Zada spoke to me directly.

45:33.191 --> 45:35.402
Said they are going to be
watching us all the time,

45:35.443 --> 45:36.695
and they're gonna look
like regular people.

45:36.736 --> 45:38.238
We're not gonna know
who they are.

45:38.279 --> 45:42.367
And we need to follow
four important rules.

45:42.409 --> 45:45.245
Okay, number one,

45:45.286 --> 45:50.709
we can't tell anyone--anyone
about Zada or Zethra

45:50.750 --> 45:52.377
or their people.

45:52.419 --> 45:53.920
Do you understand?

45:57.215 --> 46:03.096
Two, we cannot tell anyone
about the mission.

46:03.138 --> 46:05.765
Three...

46:05.807 --> 46:08.351
you can't say a word to anyone

46:08.393 --> 46:11.187
about how the allergy pills
make you sleepy.

46:11.229 --> 46:13.898
- Okay.
- Okay?

46:13.940 --> 46:18.403
- Four, you can't tell anyone
about the--

46:18.445 --> 46:20.321
the baby stuff.

46:20.363 --> 46:21.948
Okay?

46:21.990 --> 46:23.491
You understand?

46:24.784 --> 46:27.412
Say it back to me.

46:27.454 --> 46:32.959
- Don't--don't tell
about Zada and Zethra

46:33.001 --> 46:35.920
or the mission.
- Mm-hmm.

46:35.962 --> 46:39.549
- Or--
- The pills.

46:39.591 --> 46:41.968
- The pills.
- And?

46:42.010 --> 46:44.888
- And the baby.
- Good, yeah. Okay.

46:44.929 --> 46:47.474
Okay, good.

46:47.515 --> 46:48.975
This is it.

46:49.017 --> 46:50.769
This is it, Dolly, okay?

46:50.810 --> 46:52.479
You break any of those rules,

46:52.520 --> 46:55.065
they're gonna punish
Karen and Susan

46:55.106 --> 46:56.191
and your mother, too.

46:56.232 --> 46:57.901
And I don't want that
to happen.

46:57.942 --> 46:59.611
Okay, 'cause I love them.

46:59.652 --> 47:02.697
And I know I want you
to love them, too.

47:02.739 --> 47:04.574
All right, you understand?

47:05.867 --> 47:07.911
- All right.

47:08.953 --> 47:11.790
I got you something.

47:11.831 --> 47:13.041
[bangs on door]
<i>- Tiempo!</i>

47:13.083 --> 47:16.419

Just a second, please!

47:16.461 --> 47:19.339
This...

47:19.381 --> 47:23.051
This is a reminder
of the mission

47:23.093 --> 47:27.055

which makes everything okay.

I don't know
what's gonna happen to me,

47:29.766 --> 47:32.519
but I'm gonna stay strong
for you, Dolly, okay?

47:32.560 --> 47:35.230
And you stay strong for me.
You stay strong for me.

47:35.271 --> 47:37.023
I'm gonna be with you always.
I'm gonna be with you always.

47:37.065 --> 47:38.608
Okay?
I'm gonna be with you always.

47:38.650 --> 47:40.068
- Please let me stay with him,
please.

47:40.110 --> 47:41.111
- All right, I love you.
I love you. I love you.

47:41.152 --> 47:42.696
