00:03.300 --> 00:05.480
You are an important adult

00:05.610 --> 00:07.130
with an impressive life.

00:07.260 --> 00:08.570
CHIP:
Maybe I should
return to clowning,

00:08.700 --> 00:11.140
you know, as a, as a hobby.

00:11.270 --> 00:13.050
I'll change this into
a housewarming party, honey.

00:13.180 --> 00:15.140
Well, if there's no wedding,
there's no wedding gift.

00:15.270 --> 00:17.530
[people screaming]

00:17.660 --> 00:19.230
ANITA:
You'd be getting in
on the ground floor

00:19.360 --> 00:21.060
of a really great investment.

00:21.190 --> 00:23.190
Especially in seven
to nine years from now,

00:23.320 --> 00:24.540
when the bullet train's
completed.

00:24.670 --> 00:26.240
Oh.

00:28.330 --> 00:30.110
[quiet chatter]

00:30.240 --> 00:32.110
All right, Lynn,

00:32.240 --> 00:34.770
you ready to get
this thing rolling?

00:37.250 --> 00:39.560
To whom it may concern,

00:39.690 --> 00:42.820
if you find yourself
in receipt of this letter,

00:42.950 --> 00:46.260
you are in ownership
of property or acreage

00:46.390 --> 00:48.350
along the official route

00:48.480 --> 00:51.390
of California's new
high-speed rail system.

00:52.830 --> 00:54.270
Please find the enclosed map

00:54.400 --> 00:57.180

00:57.310 --> 01:00.060

to execute this project.

01:01.400 --> 01:03.410
You will be compensated

01:03.540 --> 01:06.410

â™ª

01:20.640 --> 01:22.030
[door squeaks]

01:22.160 --> 01:24.640
I'm the captain
of my own ship...

01:24.780 --> 01:26.260
-Chip?
-[gasps]

01:26.390 --> 01:27.210
God.

01:27.340 --> 01:29.040
Hey, Marcus.

01:29.170 --> 01:30.220
You scared me.

01:30.350 --> 01:32.170
I just need you
to sign right there.

01:32.300 --> 01:34.790
Yes, sir. Um...

01:34.920 --> 01:36.310
I don't have a ship.

01:36.440 --> 01:38.660
I was just doing
affirmation stuff.

01:38.790 --> 01:40.750
Okay.

01:42.360 --> 01:44.360
-Thank you.
-Yeah. Thank you.

01:53.800 --> 01:55.980
"You are in ownership
of property

"along the official route
of California's

01:58.110 --> 01:59.240
new high-speed rail system."

01:59.380 --> 02:01.290
What?

02:01.420 --> 02:03.120
"You will be compensated
for your property

02:03.250 --> 02:05.250
at competitive market pricing."

02:11.560 --> 02:13.560

Oh, God.

02:14.870 --> 02:16.830
[water gurgling]

02:23.440 --> 02:25.310
MRS. BASKETS:
Oh, can you believe all this?

02:25.440 --> 02:27.320
It happened
during our housewarming party.

02:27.450 --> 02:29.580
You know, my son did it.
He's a loose cannon.

02:29.710 --> 02:31.190
-[laughs]
-You must think
we're all lunatics.

02:31.320 --> 02:34.110
No, you'd be surprised.
I see this quite often.

02:34.240 --> 02:35.370
-You're kidding.
-CRYSTAL: Hello!

02:35.500 --> 02:37.590
Back here!

02:37.720 --> 02:39.850
Grandma!
I was ringing the doorbell.

02:39.980 --> 02:41.850
Oh, honey,
you can't hear it back here.

02:41.980 --> 02:43.720
This is Craig, honey.
He's trying

02:43.850 --> 02:45.510
to get your dad's golf cart
out of the pool.

02:45.640 --> 02:47.680
No, you should leave it in.
It looks cool.

02:47.810 --> 02:51.040
You know, I thought about it,
but honey, the rust. Mm-mm.

02:51.170 --> 02:52.470
Anyway, are you ready
for our interview?

02:52.600 --> 02:54.260
Of course. Is it gonna be like

02:54.390 --> 02:57.040
-my Channel 9 interview?
-Kind of.

02:57.170 --> 02:59.390
I have this list of questions
I'm supposed to ask you

02:59.520 --> 03:01.350
about, like,
our family ancestors.

03:01.480 --> 03:03.180
-Ugh.
-And then I have to draw this,

03:03.310 --> 03:04.400
like, family tree diagram.

03:04.530 --> 03:06.360
Well, our family tree
is full of nuts,

03:06.490 --> 03:08.360
-so I hope you know that.
-Oh, I do.

03:08.490 --> 03:10.360
Hey, do you want
an AriZona Iced Tea?

03:10.490 --> 03:12.450
I got some
of that AriZona Iced Tea.

03:12.580 --> 03:13.750
-I love the cans.
-Yeah.

03:13.880 --> 03:15.410
-Hey, Craig?
-Yeah?

03:15.540 --> 03:18.190
You want a can
of AriZona Iced Tea?

03:18.320 --> 03:20.200
Uh, maybe later, but thank you.

03:20.330 --> 03:22.550
All right. Let us know
if we can be of any help.

03:22.680 --> 03:25.160
We can't,
but let us know, anyway.

03:25.290 --> 03:27.290
[indistinct chatter]

03:30.340 --> 03:32.210
Hi. Yes, can you, uh,

03:32.340 --> 03:34.640
tell me what room this seminar
is in right here?

03:34.770 --> 03:36.650
You have to register for that.
You can't just go in.

03:36.780 --> 03:41.170
Oh, but, uh, Tammy, uh--
she-she's a friend of mine.

03:41.300 --> 03:43.650
The leader, Tammy--

03:43.780 --> 03:46.090
she's... she's a close friend.
I just wanted to say hi.

03:47.700 --> 03:49.920
Okay, don't tell anyone
I told you,

03:50.050 --> 03:51.310
but it's right
in that conference room

03:51.440 --> 03:52.880
-right there.
-Over there? Okay.

03:53.010 --> 03:54.750
TAMMY:
This is your life plan

03:54.880 --> 03:57.230
for success, and it's shaped
as the petals of...

03:57.360 --> 03:59.230
-What is this?
-Chip.

03:59.360 --> 04:01.280
-Just take a seat in the back...-Sorry.

04:01.410 --> 04:04.410
-...and I'll get to you
in a minute.
-Hold on one second.

04:04.540 --> 04:05.680
Thanks a lot, dickhead.

04:05.810 --> 04:08.590
This is the life plan
for success,

04:08.720 --> 04:10.980
as I was saying,
and as you can see,

04:11.120 --> 04:13.470
it's in the shape of a flower,
and there's...

04:13.600 --> 04:16.470
Can we get technical in here?

04:17.470 --> 04:19.250
It was in the shape of a flower.

04:19.380 --> 04:20.690
When technical...
when technical comes.

04:20.820 --> 04:22.820
Now, take out your workbooks.

04:22.950 --> 04:25.350
MRS. BASKETS:
Oh, here's my Aunt Zella.

04:25.480 --> 04:27.350
She never had a date
her whole life

04:27.480 --> 04:29.920
because her mother was
a religious fanatic.

04:30.050 --> 04:31.790
But she was such a sweet person.

04:31.920 --> 04:33.360
Well, that's good
to put in my report.

04:33.490 --> 04:35.140
Yes.

04:35.270 --> 04:37.360
Our teacher told usour ancestors were real people,

04:37.490 --> 04:39.970
you know, even though
they didn't have color photos.

04:40.100 --> 04:42.410
Yeah, but they had color, honey.

04:42.540 --> 04:44.800
[chuckling]:
They were full of it.

04:44.930 --> 04:47.460
And your Aunt Zella was
from Bakersfield, too?

04:47.590 --> 04:49.370
Uh-huh. We all were, honey.

04:49.500 --> 04:52.810
We've always paid our taxes, andwe've never had a foreclosure.

04:52.940 --> 04:55.640
Except one time when, uh...

04:55.770 --> 04:57.640
It was a mobile home,
I think, so...

04:57.770 --> 04:59.770
You want me
to put that in my report?

04:59.900 --> 05:01.300
[quietly]:
No.

05:01.430 --> 05:02.820
-Okay.
-Oh.

05:02.950 --> 05:04.730
And is any
of our family "associated

05:04.860 --> 05:06.430
"with Bakersfield landmarks
or points of interest?

05:06.560 --> 05:08.000
Explain how."

05:08.130 --> 05:09.300
What about
the Baskets Family Rodeo?

05:09.430 --> 05:11.960
I'm pretty sure
that's gonna be considered

05:12.090 --> 05:14.830
an historical site
at some point.

05:15.880 --> 05:17.310
Put that in there.

05:17.440 --> 05:19.440
-Okay.
-What's the next thing?

05:19.580 --> 05:20.970
"How has Bakersfield changed

05:21.100 --> 05:22.880
since our ancestors
settled here?"

05:23.010 --> 05:25.280
Ah! God.

05:25.410 --> 05:28.670
Honey, we better go for a ride.[chuckles]

05:28.800 --> 05:31.590
That Home Depot, you know,
it used to be a JCPenney.

05:31.720 --> 05:33.280
You could get anything there--

05:33.420 --> 05:35.500
your hair done, get some coffee.

05:35.630 --> 05:37.510
Wow. They had
the cutest robes there.

05:37.640 --> 05:38.770
I still think about it.

05:38.900 --> 05:40.420
I got one once. I love it.

05:40.550 --> 05:42.420
Are you a robe person, honey?

05:42.550 --> 05:44.690
Grandma,
we don't wear robes anymore.

05:44.820 --> 05:47.120
You don't? How sad.

05:47.250 --> 05:49.470
Oh, there's Tico's Tacos,

05:49.610 --> 05:52.350
which is now Tacos Ticos.

05:52.480 --> 05:55.700
My mother used to love
to get a chile rell-eno there.

05:55.830 --> 05:57.260
[chuckles]

05:57.400 --> 05:59.140
And then she'd say,
"All the restaurants

05:59.270 --> 06:01.230
in Bakersfield
are Mexican restaurants."

06:01.360 --> 06:02.660
You know, 'cause of the cooks.

06:02.790 --> 06:05.530
-You get it?
-Grandma.

06:05.660 --> 06:08.360
You can't say stuff like that
anymore. It's 2019.

06:08.490 --> 06:10.370
I'm just saying,
all the restaurants in town

06:10.500 --> 06:12.370
have Mexican chefs.

06:12.500 --> 06:14.720
I love their food,
and I love them.

06:14.850 --> 06:16.460
-Well, just say that, then.
-Okay.

06:16.590 --> 06:17.810
That you love
the Mexican people.

06:17.940 --> 06:19.550
I love them.
And I love you.

06:19.680 --> 06:21.460
It's like we're Thelma
and Louise here, isn't it?

06:21.590 --> 06:23.120
-[chuckles]
-Who?

06:23.250 --> 06:24.860
Uh. Oh, never mind, honey.

06:24.990 --> 06:27.080
Oh! There's Uncle Chip's

06:27.210 --> 06:28.860
Bullet Towers apartments.

06:28.990 --> 06:30.390
Named after the bullet train,

06:30.520 --> 06:31.390
of course.

06:31.520 --> 06:33.480
What's the bullet train?

06:33.610 --> 06:35.480
Well, it's a train
that's gonna go

06:35.610 --> 06:37.480
from Bakersfield up to Fresno,

06:37.610 --> 06:39.830
and hopefully,
over to Sacramento.

06:39.960 --> 06:42.350
And is it going to L.A.?

06:42.480 --> 06:44.400
L.A.? Who are you,
Sally Struthers?

06:44.530 --> 06:46.620
Who?

06:46.750 --> 06:48.140
What year were you born, honey?

06:48.270 --> 06:50.620
-2003.
-2003.

06:50.750 --> 06:53.540
That's the last time
I got my nails done.

06:53.670 --> 06:57.630
Sally was some kind of actress,and she was a great pitchwoman.

06:57.760 --> 07:00.590
She got a little chunky,
but what the hell.

07:00.720 --> 07:03.590
Oh! There's the antique shop.

07:03.720 --> 07:04.640
CRYSTAL:
What did that used to be?

07:04.770 --> 07:06.640
It was always
an antique shop, honey,

07:06.770 --> 07:08.420
but they have a gumball machine.

07:08.550 --> 07:09.470
Ooh, let's go!

07:09.600 --> 07:11.300
[chuckles]

07:11.430 --> 07:13.650
Youth. Hmm.

07:13.780 --> 07:16.910
You know, I-I tried to be
a successful businessman,

07:17.040 --> 07:18.960
and I-- and I was getting
the hang of it,

07:19.090 --> 07:20.700
and right when I was getting
the hang of it,

07:20.830 --> 07:22.790
I find out the state
is seizing the rodeo.

07:22.920 --> 07:25.440
And I can't go back to clowning.

07:25.570 --> 07:27.010
It's like clowns
are-are the new horror,

07:27.140 --> 07:29.180
and-and-and superheroes
are-are funny...

07:29.310 --> 07:30.750
The world's gone insane.

07:30.880 --> 07:32.930
It's like everything
that I've worked for

07:33.060 --> 07:34.580
is just being taken away
from me.

07:34.710 --> 07:36.540
So you came here to complain?

07:36.670 --> 07:39.410
No, I came to, you know,
get one of those...

07:39.540 --> 07:41.630
you know,
don't you do life plans?

07:41.760 --> 07:44.980
[laughs] That's not the way
it works, Chip.

07:45.110 --> 07:48.460
I am not the master
of your destiny, you are.

07:48.590 --> 07:50.680
[stammers]

07:50.810 --> 07:52.820
I'm no-- I'm not good at it.

07:54.250 --> 07:57.340
What do you really want, Chip?

07:57.470 --> 07:59.740
Did you see
these people working?

07:59.870 --> 08:03.830
They were working to create
their own life plans.

08:03.960 --> 08:06.790
The only way out of the woods

08:06.920 --> 08:11.180
is to become your own compass.

08:11.310 --> 08:13.490
Is that symbolism? 'Cause
I didn't go to no college.

08:13.620 --> 08:14.710
-[groans]
-Well, I did--

08:14.840 --> 08:16.190
-I mean, is that symbolism?
-Look.

08:16.320 --> 08:17.580
I really want...

08:17.710 --> 08:18.930
You keep talking
about everything

08:19.060 --> 08:22.410
that you don't have.

08:22.540 --> 08:25.800
Have you ever thought about
figuring out what you do have,

08:25.940 --> 08:29.590
and then making something
out of that?

08:29.720 --> 08:32.030
Okay, this is what
I want you to do.

08:32.159 --> 08:33.809
Sit here.

08:33.940 --> 08:36.730
I want you to write up

08:36.860 --> 08:40.520
your own life plan for success.

08:47.480 --> 08:49.480
You mean, be my own compass,

08:49.610 --> 08:52.050
not worry about anything
and just do something?

08:52.180 --> 08:53.620
Mm-hmm.

08:53.750 --> 08:55.660
-Good luck, hon.
-[patting Chip on shoulder]

08:59.490 --> 09:01.490
â™ª

09:10.280 --> 09:11.890
Oh! Love it.

09:12.020 --> 09:14.510
Oh, why would someone get rid
of this cute thing?

09:14.640 --> 09:16.900
That'd look so good on you.

09:17.030 --> 09:18.510
A cowgirl?

09:18.640 --> 09:20.290
Well, like Annie Oakley.

09:20.420 --> 09:21.640
Who is that?

09:21.770 --> 09:23.120
First woman of the West.

09:23.250 --> 09:25.690
She used to ride horses,
shoot guns...

09:25.820 --> 09:28.080
So, I'm Filipino
on my mom's side,

09:28.210 --> 09:30.090
but, uh, what are we
on my dad's side?

09:30.220 --> 09:31.830
Scotch-Irish, honey.

09:31.960 --> 09:33.790
Heavy on the Scotch.
No, that's a joke.

09:33.920 --> 09:35.830
Just say that we're, uh,

09:35.960 --> 09:37.700
you know, we're like a mu--
we're mutts.

09:37.830 --> 09:39.140
We're, like, Bakersfield white.

09:39.270 --> 09:41.580
-Just put that, honey.
-Okay.

09:41.710 --> 09:44.320
And if we've been in Bakersfieldfor six generations,

09:44.450 --> 09:46.320
where is everybody?

09:46.450 --> 09:48.060
They're gone, honey.

09:48.190 --> 09:50.110
We're full of diseases.

09:50.240 --> 09:52.060
We got cancer.

09:52.200 --> 09:54.550
We got whooping cough.

09:54.680 --> 09:56.590
We got diabetes.

09:56.720 --> 09:58.290
We got it all.

09:58.420 --> 10:00.160
-Ooh. Okay.
-Rosacea.

10:00.290 --> 10:01.770
How do you spell that?

10:01.900 --> 10:05.080
R-O... R-S...

10:05.210 --> 10:07.250
-Uh, R...
-There's a silent

10:07.380 --> 10:08.600
something in there.

10:08.730 --> 10:11.480
Oh. Aw.

10:11.610 --> 10:13.560
Oh, why would anyone throw out

10:13.700 --> 10:16.740
all these beautiful
family photos?

10:16.870 --> 10:17.830
So many memories.

10:17.960 --> 10:19.700
Maybe they all died together
in a fire.

10:19.830 --> 10:20.880
Oh, honey.

10:21.010 --> 10:22.920
Wouldn't the photos be burned?

10:23.050 --> 10:24.530
[chuckles]

10:24.660 --> 10:27.100
I'm gonna go buy this
for my report.

10:27.230 --> 10:28.750
-Okay, honey.
-Okay.

10:28.880 --> 10:31.890
-Hey, honey? Don't let, uh...
-Yeah?

10:32.020 --> 10:35.670
Don't let our photos end up
in a place like this, okay?

10:35.800 --> 10:38.070
Or at a garage sale
or something like that.

10:38.200 --> 10:39.330
Okay.

10:39.460 --> 10:41.290
Don't let us f-- be forgotten.

10:41.420 --> 10:42.640
You know?

10:42.770 --> 10:44.640
Okay, I-I won't.

10:44.770 --> 10:46.770
Thank you, honey.

10:48.560 --> 10:50.430
[sighs]

10:50.560 --> 10:52.860
Ah, Remington!

10:53.000 --> 10:54.430
Ah.

10:54.560 --> 10:56.090
[chuckles]
Oh, I don't think so.

10:56.220 --> 10:57.650
That's a little high.

11:06.790 --> 11:08.660
DANIEL:
Hey, Chip.

11:08.790 --> 11:11.840
Did you, did you get this?

11:11.970 --> 11:13.620
I did, yeah.

11:20.370 --> 11:22.680
Um...

11:22.810 --> 11:25.460
At first, I was real mad

11:25.590 --> 11:29.160
when I saw this, and then,

11:29.290 --> 11:31.340
and then suddenly
I started thinking.

11:31.470 --> 11:33.780
We're bursting at the seams,
right?

11:33.910 --> 11:36.130
We could use the money,
we could get another church.

11:36.260 --> 11:38.740
We could buy two parking lots.

11:38.870 --> 11:41.430
We could...

11:41.570 --> 11:44.700
I mean, m-maybe you could get
another rodeo?

11:44.830 --> 11:46.880
[clears throat]

11:47.010 --> 11:49.880
We'll probably just put this oneon the back of a flatbed truck.

11:50.010 --> 11:52.180
Just haul it somewhere.

11:52.320 --> 11:53.750
You making fun of me?

11:53.880 --> 11:57.450
No, I just-- We-we would have
to start from scratch.

11:57.580 --> 11:58.970
Well, maybe,
c-could you take the money

11:59.100 --> 12:01.850
and-and... find something else?

12:01.980 --> 12:04.590
Like, maybe a-a...

12:06.590 --> 12:09.990
...chain of craft stores, or...?

12:10.120 --> 12:12.940
I mean...

12:13.080 --> 12:16.380
M-Maybe there's another rodeo
that needs a CEO?

12:16.510 --> 12:19.910
I don't think that exists.

12:20.040 --> 12:22.820
Being a CEO of a rodeo
was just kind of made up here.

12:22.950 --> 12:24.700
Plus, I-I'm really a clown.

12:24.830 --> 12:26.310
I mean, I'm a... I'm a c--

12:26.440 --> 12:28.390
You know, I'm a clown
and somehow I ended up...

12:28.530 --> 12:30.050
Right.

12:30.180 --> 12:33.440
I mean,
I'm just here trying to...

12:33.570 --> 12:36.400
keep things together.

12:36.530 --> 12:39.450
So, it's not the same for us.
[sniffs]

12:39.580 --> 12:41.710
Listen, I'm-I'm sorry.

12:41.840 --> 12:42.890
[stammers] I'll leave you to it,

12:43.020 --> 12:45.240
but any time you want to talk,

12:45.370 --> 12:47.280
I'm always here for you.

12:47.410 --> 12:49.240
-I appreciate that, Reverend.
-Until we have to sell.

12:49.370 --> 12:50.940
But-but I'll still be here.

12:51.070 --> 12:52.850
-Yeah. Mm-hmm.
-You know...

12:52.980 --> 12:54.860
on Skype or video or...

12:56.770 --> 12:58.640
Chip.

12:58.770 --> 13:01.040
That-that train is-is-is coming,

13:01.170 --> 13:03.210
and I hope you find peace
with it

13:03.340 --> 13:05.870
'cause you don't really
have a choice.

13:06.000 --> 13:07.960
Right?

13:13.440 --> 13:15.350
[quietly]:
Here comes the choo choo.

MRS. BASKETS:
Oh, my old junior high.

14:28.120 --> 14:30.170
Hey, do the girls still smoke
in the bathroom?

14:30.300 --> 14:33.040
We used to smoke up a storm
back then.

14:33.170 --> 14:35.000
Grandma,
smoking is terrible for you.

14:35.130 --> 14:37.180
-Well, not back then.
-[both chuckle]

14:37.310 --> 14:38.570
Oh, Grandma.

14:38.700 --> 14:40.740
That's my friend Zoe.
Zoe, come here!

14:40.880 --> 14:43.010
MRS. BASKETS:
That's a funny name
for a boy, honey.

14:43.140 --> 14:43.920
-It's a girl.
-Oh.

14:44.050 --> 14:45.230
She just has short hair.

14:45.360 --> 14:46.920
-Hi.
-Hey! This is my grandma.

14:47.060 --> 14:48.320
Grandma, this is Zoe.

14:48.450 --> 14:49.800
-Hello.
-Hi, Zoe.

14:49.930 --> 14:50.930
-What are you doing here?
-I'm waiting

14:51.060 --> 14:52.890
for my mom to get back
from work.

14:53.020 --> 14:54.060
Can she come over and swim?

14:54.190 --> 14:56.060
Well, if Craig got the golf cart

14:56.190 --> 14:57.540
out of the pool, she can.

14:57.670 --> 14:59.980
-Get in.
-[Crystal chuckles]

15:00.110 --> 15:02.160
What does your mom do
that she works so late?

15:02.290 --> 15:03.460
ZOE:
She's a nurse.

15:03.590 --> 15:04.990
MRS. BASKETS:
Oh, I love nurses.

15:05.120 --> 15:06.200
Let's get out of here, girls.

15:06.340 --> 15:08.030
[horn honks]

15:08.160 --> 15:10.910
Oh, he got it out of the pool.

15:11.040 --> 15:13.080
Good job, Craig.

15:13.210 --> 15:15.780
Well, you didn't clean the pool,though, Craig.

15:15.910 --> 15:18.040
I guess that doesn't come
with it, huh?

15:18.170 --> 15:21.000
Well, I hope you girls
have a lot of fun swimming.

15:21.130 --> 15:22.480
Is that a chili can?

15:22.610 --> 15:24.830
Pick some of that up for me,
will you?

15:24.960 --> 15:26.920
-Ah!
-[Crystal laughs]

15:27.050 --> 15:30.840
You crazy girls!
I'm going to, uh...

15:30.970 --> 15:34.930
put a couple Salisbury steak
dinners in for you.

15:35.060 --> 15:37.060

16:05.310 --> 16:07.000
[ringtone playing
"The Star-Spangled Banner"]

16:10.750 --> 16:12.660
Hey, Chip.

16:12.790 --> 16:15.400
Hey. Listen, have any of you
or your trailer park friends

16:15.530 --> 16:18.060
heard anything about this bullettrain coming through town?

16:18.190 --> 16:19.450
Yeah, I know
about the bullet train.

16:19.580 --> 16:22.060
It's a cover story so liberals
can raise all that money,

16:22.190 --> 16:23.670
and you know what they're
gonna do with all that money?

16:23.800 --> 16:25.330
[whispering]: They're gonna makea supermax prison

16:25.460 --> 16:27.680
for us conservatives like me.

16:27.810 --> 16:29.900
Dale, it's-it's real. It's real.

16:30.030 --> 16:33.160
Well, you've got your opinion,
and I've got my facts.

16:33.290 --> 16:34.730
Hey, listen, I'm doing
an emergency family meeting.

16:34.860 --> 16:37.080
Be at the rodeo in lessthan an hour, you understand me?

16:37.210 --> 16:38.470
I'll be there,
locked and loaded.

16:38.600 --> 16:40.780
No, do not lock and load.
Just show up, okay?

16:40.910 --> 16:42.170
Bye.

16:44.220 --> 16:45.870
Idiot.

16:48.960 --> 16:49.960
ZOE:
Thanks, Mrs. Baskets.

16:50.090 --> 16:52.530
Oh, take care, sweetheart.

16:53.960 --> 16:56.450
CRYSTAL:
Bye. I'll call you later.

17:01.450 --> 17:03.320
Thank you for taking her home.

17:03.450 --> 17:05.190
Oh, you're welcome.

17:05.319 --> 17:07.200
Hey, Crystal, honey,

17:07.329 --> 17:09.200
you know,
I saw you and your friend

17:09.329 --> 17:10.890
kissing in the pool.

17:11.030 --> 17:14.119
-Yeah?
-And I know

17:14.250 --> 17:16.290
things can be confusing
when you're your age,

17:16.420 --> 17:20.380
and I just want you to know
that I'm available to talk

17:20.510 --> 17:23.250
-if you ever need to talk.
-Oh, my God. Grandma!

17:23.390 --> 17:25.260
Please,
we were just messing around.

17:25.390 --> 17:26.300
It's no big deal.

17:26.430 --> 17:29.170
Well, I mean, it is a big deal.

17:29.300 --> 17:31.220
I mean, I love Ellen.
She's terrific.

17:31.350 --> 17:33.220
Most of my friends are bi.

17:33.350 --> 17:34.140
Bi?

17:34.270 --> 17:35.830
Oh, bisexual.

17:35.960 --> 17:38.570
Oh, yeah, well...

17:38.700 --> 17:42.140
Well, you know,
I just worry about you,

17:42.270 --> 17:43.970
and I want you to be happy,

17:44.100 --> 17:46.840
and I want you to knowI'll go to any parade you want.

17:46.970 --> 17:48.320
Except I won't be able to walk

17:48.450 --> 17:51.280
'cause I have
that darn plantar fasciitis.

17:51.410 --> 17:53.500
And it's no fun.
It hurts like hell.

17:53.630 --> 17:55.290
Don't worry.

17:55.420 --> 17:57.160
-Okay.
-All right?

17:57.290 --> 18:00.070
This generation of yours
is moving so fast.

18:00.200 --> 18:02.290
-I can't keep up with it.
-[laughs]

18:02.420 --> 18:03.380
No, you're cool, though.

18:03.510 --> 18:05.040
You're, like,
the coolest grandma out there.

18:05.170 --> 18:07.260
Oh! And you're
the coolest grandchild,

18:07.390 --> 18:08.650
-but don't tell your sister.
-[laughs] Okay.

18:08.780 --> 18:10.170
[chuckles]
She'll be mad at me.

18:10.300 --> 18:13.220
-[ringtone playing]
-Oh.

18:13.350 --> 18:15.310
-Hello?
-CHIP: Hey, Mom? Chip here.

18:15.440 --> 18:17.350
Hey. Chip, what's up?

18:17.480 --> 18:19.220
Hey, I need you
to come over to the rodeo.

18:19.350 --> 18:20.620
Oh. We'll be right there.

18:20.750 --> 18:22.270
-Thanks. See you.
-Okay, honey.

18:22.400 --> 18:25.100
Oh, we got to go.
Your uncle needs us.

18:29.630 --> 18:31.760
MRS. BASKETS:
Seizing the rodeo?!

18:31.890 --> 18:33.320
-What?!
-Yeah.

18:33.460 --> 18:35.240
-Read that again.
-Okay.

18:35.370 --> 18:36.980
-"To whom it may concern..."
-Let me see this, please.

18:37.110 --> 18:39.240
Oh, my God.

18:39.370 --> 18:41.290
This is just the government
infringing on our rights

18:41.420 --> 18:42.770
just because some pinko liberals

18:42.900 --> 18:44.900
voted on a speed train
to get up to the Gay Area

18:45.030 --> 18:47.300
so that they can have
their San Francisco treats.

18:47.430 --> 18:49.120
Dale. Don't say that.

18:49.250 --> 18:51.600
It's okay to be gay or bi.

18:54.870 --> 18:56.570
O-Okay, can we get back
on track here?

18:56.700 --> 18:59.220
[sighs] Maybe we should've
never bought the rodeo.

18:59.350 --> 19:01.140
Okay? But we did,

19:01.270 --> 19:03.700
and we've almost killed
ourselves to keep it open.

19:03.830 --> 19:06.710
-Amen to that.
-So I don't think
we should lay low.

19:06.840 --> 19:08.050
I think we should fight this.

19:09.100 --> 19:10.230
Let's fight it.

19:10.360 --> 19:11.710
-I love that.
-Yeah, right?

19:11.840 --> 19:13.670
And then, listen, I think
the next thing we should do

19:13.800 --> 19:18.240
is go to Assemblyman
Brian Von Vogel's office

19:18.370 --> 19:19.810
and let him know we're not gonna

19:19.940 --> 19:21.590
-take it laying down.
-I'm in.

19:21.720 --> 19:23.590
-I'm in.
-I'm in.

19:23.720 --> 19:25.200
-I'm in.
-You're in school, fool.

19:25.330 --> 19:27.200
All right,
let's make some protest signs.

19:27.340 --> 19:29.290
Meeting adjourned.
Thanks, everybody.

19:29.420 --> 19:31.250
DALE:
Let's do it. Pretty good
leadership there, Chip.

19:31.380 --> 19:34.120
Pretty good leadership.

19:34.260 --> 19:36.170
CRYSTAL:
And then on my fraternal side
of the family,

19:36.300 --> 19:37.430
we're Scotch-Irish,

19:37.560 --> 19:39.480
sixth generation
Bakersfield-ian.

19:39.610 --> 19:41.960
My great-great-grandfather
William Scott Baskets

19:42.090 --> 19:45.350
emigrated from Ireland
to California in 1814.

19:45.480 --> 19:47.090
He married
and had three children.

19:47.220 --> 19:48.310
He bought a plot of land

19:48.440 --> 19:49.920
and then planted
a date palm orchard on it.

19:50.050 --> 19:51.320
And one by one,

19:51.450 --> 19:53.360
his family members
came over to America,

19:53.490 --> 19:55.750
and together they built
one of the first successful

19:55.890 --> 19:57.970
dried fruit businesses
in the Central Valley.

19:58.100 --> 19:59.280
Today, that tradition

19:59.410 --> 20:00.410
of hard work, determination

20:00.540 --> 20:02.410
and family unity continues,

20:02.540 --> 20:04.850
especially in the face
of adversity.

20:06.460 --> 20:08.290
[tires squealing]

20:11.860 --> 20:13.340
-CHIP: Ow!
-MRS. BASKETS: Oh!

20:13.470 --> 20:14.990
DALE:  Well, get those seat belts on.
