WEBVTT

02:08.169 --> 02:09.838
- You see?
- Yes.

02:09.922 --> 02:12.799
I told you. You can manifest anything.

02:12.883 --> 02:15.177
- Yes, you did.
- Do you see that?

02:15.802 --> 02:17.513
I do. Yeah. Yeah.

02:22.017 --> 02:23.560
So, what do you want?

02:32.152 --> 02:33.612
I want the sun.

02:37.074 --> 02:39.159
Let's manifest the sun.

02:43.914 --> 02:45.499
Corte Madera?

02:46.083 --> 02:47.835
<i>California.</i>

02:53.048 --> 02:54.633
Yeah, I don't think I can do this.

02:54.716 --> 02:57.261
<i>Of course you can.
It's easy. It's a board meeting.</i>

02:57.344 --> 02:59.638
<i>Just tell them
all the amazing things we're doing.</i>

02:59.721 --> 03:00.722
When are you coming back?

03:00.806 --> 03:02.891
- Back where?
- <i>Back here.</i>

03:02.975 --> 03:04.101
I am here.

03:08.188 --> 03:11.108
Well, I don't know what that means.

03:11.608 --> 03:13.819
I'm at WeWork right now.

03:13.902 --> 03:17.114
WeWork is-- It's wherever we are.

03:29.084 --> 03:30.002
Hi.

03:36.508 --> 03:37.968
Does everyone have water?

03:39.928 --> 03:41.680
May I have some of your water?

03:42.848 --> 03:44.141
Where's Adam?

03:47.269 --> 03:48.896
Hey!

03:58.155 --> 03:59.698
What are you doing, <i>motek</i>?

04:01.658 --> 04:02.659
Dreaming.

04:03.785 --> 04:05.245
Oh, yeah?

04:05.329 --> 04:09.082
- Mommy, look. I found a crab leg.
- Oh, wow!

04:09.166 --> 04:10.542
- Let me see.
- No, the seagull--

05:27.286 --> 05:30.122
- My love, do you have a minute?
- Of course, of course.

05:31.373 --> 05:36.003
So… I found the old pitch deck
that you and Miguel made after Greendesk.

05:36.086 --> 05:38.380
And I started thinking back
to Concept Living

05:38.463 --> 05:43.260
and what it means to truly create
a physical social network.

05:43.343 --> 05:45.554
And I just started riffing
and, well…

05:52.269 --> 05:53.770
We revolutionized work.

05:54.938 --> 05:58.901
Now we bring WeWork's mission,
our entire philosophy,

06:00.110 --> 06:05.115
to airlines, gyms, to banking, living.

06:06.909 --> 06:09.244
We are more than WeWork.

06:09.328 --> 06:12.956
We are a way of life.

06:20.422 --> 06:22.257
So what do you think?

06:28.013 --> 06:32.267
I think… it's magic.

06:32.351 --> 06:34.144
And I think you're magic.

06:34.228 --> 06:35.395
Love it!

06:36.188 --> 06:39.149
- I'm a magician.
- You're a magician.

06:42.986 --> 06:47.533
<i>Our core mission remains the same:
to elevate the world's consciousness.</i>

06:47.616 --> 06:51.954
<i>But now we will be even more
than coworking space. Even more.</i>

06:52.037 --> 06:53.455
<i>You don't think small, do you?</i>

06:53.539 --> 06:55.832
<i>No, no.
I don't know any other way to think.</i>

06:55.916 --> 06:57.501
<i>You made </i>Fortune<i>'s Unicorn List</i>

06:57.584 --> 07:01.713
<i>of private companies
with valuations over one billion dollars.</i>

07:01.797 --> 07:04.508
<i>You're poised to control
the most square footage in New York City.</i>

07:04.591 --> 07:07.344
<i>Yet some of the world's
greatest companies have stumbled</i>

07:07.427 --> 07:10.681
<i>when they've taken their eyes off the ball
of their core businesses.</i>

07:11.181 --> 07:12.599
<i>We don't stumble.</i>

07:14.101 --> 07:15.435
<i>WeFly.</i>

07:16.687 --> 07:18.564
Did he just pitch a WeWork airline?

07:18.647 --> 07:20.566
- <i>My pleasure.</i>
- <i>Thank you. Good to see you.</i>

07:33.120 --> 07:35.038
You took the kids out of school?

07:35.122 --> 07:37.541
Well, we're homeschooling them
with a Chabad curriculum.

07:37.624 --> 07:39.793
They're receiving the best education
in the world.

07:40.586 --> 07:43.630
The swell was at least six feet.

07:44.256 --> 07:45.591
- Bruce!
- Adam.

07:45.674 --> 07:46.842
Bruce!

07:46.925 --> 07:49.887
Welcome to our new home. Welcome.

07:49.970 --> 07:51.638
What the hell are you doing here?

07:51.722 --> 07:54.057
I am so sorry. It's Harlow's school.

07:54.141 --> 07:56.143
Oh, okay. Okay.

07:56.226 --> 07:58.145
Hello. Rebekah Paltrow Neumann.

07:58.228 --> 08:00.105
- Can I get you anything?
- Look.

08:01.023 --> 08:02.191
They're turning on you.

08:04.568 --> 08:07.112
What do you mean?

08:07.196 --> 08:09.907
I mean, who is turning on me?

08:10.949 --> 08:12.075
The board.

08:12.951 --> 08:15.579
They wanna go public.

08:16.455 --> 08:19.666
And they're concerned that
your eccentricities are not the right fit

08:19.750 --> 08:22.002
- for the CEO of a public company.
- Wait, wait, wait.

08:22.085 --> 08:23.295
My eccentricities?

08:24.338 --> 08:25.631
My eccentricities?

08:25.714 --> 08:29.635
Like what? The fact that I work
24 hours a day, seven days a week?

08:29.718 --> 08:33.639
Or that I've grown this company
faster than Google or Alibaba or Amazon?

08:33.722 --> 08:36.642
Those eccentricities, Bruce?
Those eccentricities?

08:36.725 --> 08:38.309
I'm in your corner.

08:38.393 --> 08:39.394
I'm on your side.

08:39.477 --> 08:43.357
Then you should be talking to them.
Not to me. Not to me, Bruce.

08:44.191 --> 08:45.567
I came to you first.

08:46.902 --> 08:49.279
When we were trying to expand,
I needed you.

08:51.865 --> 08:53.200
And you turned me away.

08:56.453 --> 08:58.539
I'm sorry you see it that way.

08:59.665 --> 09:04.878
The way I see it,
I have been with you from the start.

09:05.879 --> 09:07.673
I have given you millions.

09:08.715 --> 09:12.219
- But you seem to have forgotten.
- No, no. I haven't forgotten.

09:13.095 --> 09:14.263
I'm curious.

09:14.346 --> 09:18.350
At Benchmark, do you speak
to the CEO of Uber this way?

09:19.059 --> 09:21.520
That's what I wonder. I'm thinking no.

09:25.649 --> 09:26.859
"WeBike"?

09:28.485 --> 09:30.237
A bicycle valet service.

09:32.990 --> 09:36.410
Yeah. It's your company.
You get to make the decisions.

09:38.662 --> 09:42.124
As long as you're in charge,
you get to call the shots.

09:43.834 --> 09:46.336
Next time, I will call.

09:56.638 --> 09:57.848
We have to go back.

09:59.808 --> 10:02.686
If you're worried
about our kids falling behind,

10:02.769 --> 10:05.189
then you're using
the wrong measuring stick.

10:05.272 --> 10:07.357
I have them listen in
on Adam's business calls

10:07.441 --> 10:08.734
in between tutoring sessions.

10:08.817 --> 10:11.236
I mean, second years
at Harvard Business School would kill

10:11.320 --> 10:12.529
for this kind of education.

10:12.613 --> 10:14.948
You should see it, what Rivka's doing.

10:15.032 --> 10:16.408
- It's amazing.
- Thank you.

10:16.491 --> 10:19.286
And we are teaching them
conscious entrepreneurship.

10:20.329 --> 10:22.998
We believe in a traditional curriculum.

10:23.081 --> 10:25.918
Phonics, addition, subtraction.

10:26.001 --> 10:28.837
- Things like that.
- They're getting all of that. All of it.

10:28.921 --> 10:31.715
Traditional curriculums breed
traditional thinkers.

10:32.841 --> 10:36.345
Then maybe we're not the right school
for you or your daughter.

10:37.679 --> 10:39.515
Listen, we want Harlow here.

10:39.598 --> 10:43.018
But it sounds like you need to decide
whether that's the right fit.

10:46.146 --> 10:49.733
I feel bad for the other kids.
I really do.

10:49.816 --> 10:53.862
I wish they were getting
the kind of education that Harlow is.

10:53.946 --> 10:57.783
Hello. Put a stop payment
on the last check to Harlow's school.

10:57.866 --> 11:02.538
We're going to find another place for her
to finger-paint for $42,000 a year.

11:02.621 --> 11:03.664
Yes.

11:03.747 --> 11:07.000
And to think we were going to donate
a meditation room.

11:10.587 --> 11:14.216
No, the curriculum's fantastic, but
what about the socialization aspect of it?

11:14.299 --> 11:15.759
We can't overlook that.

11:17.678 --> 11:20.430
- Spence?
- It's too far.

11:20.514 --> 11:22.432
- Sacred Heart?
- It's too Catholic.

11:22.516 --> 11:25.310
- Hackley?
- No, no. No.

11:25.394 --> 11:28.480
None of these schools
are going to feed our children's souls.

11:33.819 --> 11:35.445
You're not crazy enough.

11:36.530 --> 11:37.531
Adam.

12:12.900 --> 12:14.484
- Yes.
- Yes.

12:16.445 --> 12:19.114
- Yes.
- Yes.

12:19.198 --> 12:21.200
- Oh, my God.
- Hey.

12:21.283 --> 12:23.702
Oh, yes.

12:24.828 --> 12:27.039
- We're gonna start a school.
- Yes.

12:27.122 --> 12:28.624
We're gonna start a s--

12:28.707 --> 12:32.002
I need to order some books on education.
I'll be right back.

12:32.085 --> 12:36.215
Ingrid? Ingrid? Where's my phone?

12:38.842 --> 12:39.843
Miggy-Migs!

12:39.927 --> 12:41.136
<i>Turn on CNBC.</i>

12:42.763 --> 12:45.516
- CNBC? Why?
- <i>Just turn it on.</i>

12:45.599 --> 12:46.975
<i>And it's now official,</i>

12:47.059 --> 12:50.229
<i>Travis Kalanick has resigned
as CEO of Uber.</i>

12:50.312 --> 12:53.106
<i>Five of the ride-hailing giant's
biggest investors</i>

12:53.190 --> 12:56.068
<i>demanded that Kalanick
step down immediately.</i>

12:56.151 --> 12:58.445
<i>This included Uber's largest shareholder,</i>

12:58.529 --> 13:01.573
<i>the venture capital firm
Benchmark Capital.</i>

13:01.657 --> 13:04.409
<i>Benchmark.
We're good with Benchmark, right?</i>

13:05.536 --> 13:06.787
Calling you back.

13:06.870 --> 13:08.914
<i>…delivered to the embattled CEO.</i>

13:08.997 --> 13:10.457
<i>In a just-released statement…</i>

13:23.595 --> 13:26.056
I'm gonna get Bjarke Ingels to design it.

13:26.139 --> 13:28.308
Great. Great.

13:39.069 --> 13:40.070
Bruce is here.

13:40.654 --> 13:41.738
- Bruce?
- Bruce.

13:45.242 --> 13:46.243
Intention.

13:46.785 --> 13:48.161
Clarity.

13:56.920 --> 13:59.214
- You mind if we come in?
- Hi.

13:59.298 --> 14:00.174
Hey.

14:00.257 --> 14:01.508
- Hey. Adam--
- How's the back?

14:01.592 --> 14:02.593
- Good.
- Good.

14:02.676 --> 14:05.012
I want you to meet Cameron Lautner.

14:05.095 --> 14:08.557
And, Cameron,
the legendary Adam Neumann.

14:08.640 --> 14:11.894
- Cameron! That's the name of our masseuse.
- Our masseuse.

14:11.977 --> 14:13.979
- Our masseuse.
- Yeah, well, we call her Cammy.

14:14.062 --> 14:16.732
Yes, yes, Cammy.
We can call you Cammy Number Two.

14:16.815 --> 14:17.900
Cam is fine.

14:17.983 --> 14:20.819
But Cammy's easier to remember.
It's got a ring to it.

14:20.903 --> 14:23.447
Yeah,
I thought unicorns had hooves actually.

14:23.530 --> 14:25.782
- That's sneakers.
- We have horns too.

14:25.866 --> 14:27.993
Be careful. Be careful.

14:28.076 --> 14:29.912
I'll get you.

14:29.995 --> 14:32.998
And this is Adam's cofounder, Miguel.

14:33.081 --> 14:34.416
- Nice to meet you.
- Pleasure.

14:34.499 --> 14:36.710
- And his wife, Re--
- Chief Branding Officer.

14:36.793 --> 14:40.214
- And Chief Branding Officer, Rebekah.
- Rebekah Paltrow Neumann.

14:40.297 --> 14:42.341
- Absolutely charmed.
- Thank you.

14:42.424 --> 14:43.383
My better half.

14:44.051 --> 14:46.803
Cameron is one of my partners
at Benchmark.

14:46.887 --> 14:49.473
And he's here to help.

14:49.556 --> 14:54.144
Yeah, well…
didn't know we needed help. But…

14:54.728 --> 14:56.772
Everyone can do with
a little help, can't they?

14:56.855 --> 14:58.524
We've been doing pretty good
on our own.

14:58.607 --> 15:01.860
Or maybe you still can't see the horn.
It's right here. You see it?

15:01.944 --> 15:04.738
- Yes, you do have a little horn, Adam.
- Yes, I do.

15:05.280 --> 15:10.536
Benchmark's recommendation is that
you let us help you prepare for an IPO.

15:10.619 --> 15:13.205
Just tighten things up a bit.

15:13.288 --> 15:16.333
But it's your company.
I mean, you call the shots.

15:17.584 --> 15:18.669
Well, what do you think?

15:23.757 --> 15:27.219
- I think everyone could use a little help.
- Yeah.

15:27.302 --> 15:29.721
- Oh, hi, Bea.
- Good lad. Great.

15:29.805 --> 15:30.931
Bjarke.

15:31.014 --> 15:33.141
Bjarke?
Okay, I'll meet him by the elevators.

15:33.225 --> 15:35.310
If you'll excuse me.
I have to meet with our architect.

15:35.894 --> 15:37.187
We're starting a school.

15:37.271 --> 15:40.023
See you later.
Lovely to meet you. Bruce.

15:40.107 --> 15:41.900
Chief Brand Officer.

15:43.068 --> 15:46.822
Yeah, well, you know,
the market doesn't really like education.

15:46.905 --> 15:48.907
There's no money in it. So…

15:50.075 --> 15:51.869
But you get that. You get it.

15:51.952 --> 15:54.413
Look, who should I speak to
about my office?

15:57.165 --> 15:59.751
- Your office?
- I live here now, mate.

16:05.048 --> 16:06.341
I see clouds.

16:09.720 --> 16:13.724
Clouds. Of Burmese teak.

16:13.807 --> 16:16.810
Yes. Yes, Bjarke. And…

16:20.397 --> 16:22.816
A meadow. Right?

16:23.650 --> 16:24.735
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

16:24.818 --> 16:26.028
Yeah.

16:26.111 --> 16:27.821
Oh, this is incredible.

16:27.905 --> 16:31.450
Can you feel the energy
that we're creating in here?

16:31.533 --> 16:32.743
Yes, I do.

16:34.494 --> 16:35.746
These columns?

16:36.663 --> 16:38.707
But they're not columns.

16:38.790 --> 16:40.709
- They're not?
- They're trees.

16:40.792 --> 16:43.086
They're trees. I just got chills.

16:43.170 --> 16:45.380
Oh, my gosh. Just wow.

16:46.507 --> 16:47.549
- Yes.
- Yes. Yes?

16:47.633 --> 16:51.512
- Yes.
- This energy will be expensive.

16:52.304 --> 16:57.226
Bjarke, our mission is
to unleash every child's superpowers.

16:57.309 --> 16:59.269
You can't put a price tag on that.

17:04.858 --> 17:07.444
I don't understand.
I thought this is what we wanted, right?

17:07.528 --> 17:08.529
To go public?

17:13.825 --> 17:16.244
Miguel, you and I grew up on communes.

17:16.828 --> 17:20.207
We had to share clothes, toys, everything.

17:20.290 --> 17:22.459
We never had anything that belonged to us.

17:22.542 --> 17:26.046
Now WeWork is ours. It's ours!

17:26.672 --> 17:30.801
And we will not have our company
belong to other people. Not yet. Not yet.

17:32.344 --> 17:34.429
What about our employees
and their options?

17:34.513 --> 17:36.932
Cam's asking for balance sheets
for the past ten years.

17:37.933 --> 17:39.935
Give him nothing.

17:41.645 --> 17:42.938
Wait, no, no!

17:44.273 --> 17:45.399
Give him everything.

17:47.317 --> 17:48.819
Everything.

17:52.406 --> 17:56.451
Welcome to WeWork, motherfucker.

18:09.882 --> 18:13.844
Okay, just fill in the open spaces.
Start in the back. Stack 'em up.

18:15.179 --> 18:17.639
Any open space, fill it with a box.
Thank you.

18:19.057 --> 18:21.310
Think you'll need help with an intern, or…

18:22.060 --> 18:23.562
No, I'm good.

19:24.289 --> 19:26.708
The glasses…

19:27.751 --> 19:32.965
Okay. I just wanted to take a moment
to thank you for-- for making the time.

19:33.048 --> 19:34.508
I know you're terribly busy.

19:35.384 --> 19:37.886
Couple of questions I had.

19:37.970 --> 19:40.556
What's Wavegarden?

19:40.639 --> 19:43.350
It's a really great wave pool that we--

19:43.433 --> 19:45.936
He knows what it is. He has all the files.

19:46.019 --> 19:48.313
Yeah, well, I just wanted to check--

19:49.147 --> 19:51.733
WeWork didn't buy a stake
in a wave pool company

19:51.817 --> 19:54.444
just 'cause you like to surf, did it?

19:54.528 --> 19:57.114
Actually, we're planning on building
a permanent summer camp.

19:57.197 --> 19:58.198
- Excellent.
- Permanent.

19:58.282 --> 20:00.033
How about Laird Superfood?

20:00.117 --> 20:04.538
That's a…
turmeric-and-mushroom-infused creamers.

20:04.621 --> 20:05.455
It's delicious.

20:05.539 --> 20:07.541
So, I'm just trying
to understand things here.

20:07.624 --> 20:12.671
Why would a shared workspace company
buy a stake

20:12.754 --> 20:14.339
in a coffee creamer company?

20:14.423 --> 20:17.968
- Because our employees drink coffee.
- Just…

20:18.051 --> 20:19.887
Let them finish. Let them finish.

20:19.970 --> 20:24.099
This particular coffee creamer company
is owned by Laird Hamilton.

20:24.183 --> 20:26.393
So I know it's a silly, silly question,

20:27.269 --> 20:29.396
but did you buy a stake in it

20:29.479 --> 20:33.775
because you wanted to hang out
with famous surfers, or…

20:36.862 --> 20:38.947
I can see this is a little performance.

20:39.031 --> 20:41.408
- And it's very, very entertaining.
- Thank you.

20:41.491 --> 20:44.786
But please get to the point.
I have a company to run.

20:44.870 --> 20:48.165
The thing is that this is
what they're going to do, isn't it?

20:48.248 --> 20:51.168
You know, they're gonna
ask all the tough questions.

20:51.251 --> 20:52.961
They're gonna look under every stone.

20:53.045 --> 20:57.424
And six people hit on this
in, what, less than a week?

20:57.508 --> 21:00.761
So, honest question.
I want your answer here.

21:00.844 --> 21:02.221
What do you think's gonna happen

21:02.304 --> 21:04.890
when every analyst in the fucking world
is looking at WeWork?

21:14.733 --> 21:18.111
The board never objected
to a single one of these transactions.

21:18.195 --> 21:22.658
Trust me, I get that.
The thing is…

21:22.741 --> 21:24.785
when you're a private company,
you can do whatever you want.

21:24.868 --> 21:27.621
Buy all the coffee creamers you want.
Honestly. I don't give a fuck.

21:27.704 --> 21:30.582
But when you go public,

21:30.666 --> 21:33.126
there are the SEC shareholders
to think about, right?

21:33.210 --> 21:37.422
10-Ks and 8-Ks and 8-Qs and Forms 3, 4, 5

21:37.506 --> 21:41.218
and Schedules 13s and--
Absolutely boring. I know.

21:41.301 --> 21:43.178
But it's really important
we get this done,

21:43.262 --> 21:46.098
so if we can just put our big boy pants on
for a little while longer

21:46.181 --> 21:48.642
and just push on through this--
Is that all right?

21:49.226 --> 21:50.811
- Continue.
- Thank you.

21:55.148 --> 22:00.153
You told <i>The Wall Street Journal</i>
that WeWork was profitable.

22:00.737 --> 22:03.532
You said we wouldn't need
any more investment before the IPO.

22:03.615 --> 22:04.992
That's just not true.

22:05.534 --> 22:08.078
Just help me out here.
Why are you lying, Mr. Neumann?

22:23.927 --> 22:25.596
Turn that fucking music off!

22:29.099 --> 22:31.894
Continue. Continue.
You've got my attention.

22:33.187 --> 22:37.983
I just feel like the right partner will
authenticate our mission even more.

22:38.066 --> 22:41.612
So, to that end,
I want Adam Braun to run it.

22:41.695 --> 22:43.238
- Scooter Braun's brother.
- Yes.

22:43.322 --> 22:45.240
- I--
- Hello, shalom.

22:45.324 --> 22:46.825
Yes. Sorry to interrupt.

22:46.909 --> 22:48.118
No, no, no, no.

22:48.202 --> 22:51.747
I did a piece on Scooter Braun
back when Justin and Selena broke up, so…

22:51.830 --> 22:53.540
MissionU is very successful.

22:53.624 --> 22:55.584
- He'll never leave.
- Okay.

22:55.667 --> 22:58.128
So we buy MissionU.

22:58.212 --> 22:59.254
Brilliant.

22:59.338 --> 23:01.590
- How much is it?
- Four million if we're lucky.

23:01.673 --> 23:03.133
Okay, great. So--

23:03.217 --> 23:04.801
Talk to you tomorrow. Thanks.

23:07.554 --> 23:09.431
- Good meeting?
- Oh, so good.

23:09.515 --> 23:10.891
There's so much to do.

23:10.974 --> 23:12.476
Great, great, great.

23:16.688 --> 23:19.066
We can't buy any more companies right now.

23:20.484 --> 23:24.279
Adam, I can't slow down.

23:24.363 --> 23:26.073
WeGrow's mission is too important.

23:26.156 --> 23:29.159
WeGrow's mission will have to wait, okay?

23:30.202 --> 23:31.495
No.

23:32.329 --> 23:34.331
I'm not going to wait. Not anymore.

23:38.460 --> 23:39.878
You've let negative thoughts in.

23:44.216 --> 23:46.969
Yeah, well, it's just--

23:47.052 --> 23:50.055
I don't know what to manifest anymore.
I feel trapped.

23:56.770 --> 23:58.146
So manifest freedom.

24:04.987 --> 24:05.988
Okay.

24:06.071 --> 24:08.198
I'm gonna have the lawyers
draw up the contracts.

24:24.506 --> 24:28.927
<i>Y muchas gracias</i>
to the mayor. Yes. The mayor.

24:31.138 --> 24:33.724
And to our 100th city.

24:35.601 --> 24:38.228
- <i>Nosotros!</i>
- <i>Trabajamos!</i>

24:38.312 --> 24:40.689
- <i>Nosotros!</i>
- <i>Trabajamos!</i>

24:40.772 --> 24:43.442
- <i>Nosotros!</i>
- <i>Trabajamos!</i>

24:43.525 --> 24:45.819
- <i>Nosotros!</i>
- <i>Trabajamos!</i>

24:45.903 --> 24:49.031
- <i>Nosotros!</i>
- <i>Trabajamos!</i>

24:49.114 --> 24:50.115
Yeah!

24:51.325 --> 24:52.367
Here we go. One more.

24:52.451 --> 24:54.745
- Come on, man.
- Yo, here we go.

24:54.828 --> 24:55.913
Here we go.

24:55.996 --> 24:58.332
- I have to go to <i>el baño</i>.
- Hold on. You ready?

24:58.415 --> 25:00.209
- Yes, yes.
- Oh! Whoa!

25:00.292 --> 25:03.295
- No, no! Whoa!
- Whoa!

25:04.880 --> 25:05.881
Masa!

25:07.257 --> 25:11.553
"Meet me in Mexico City"? You're crazy.

25:11.637 --> 25:15.390
- Right? Yes! Who's crazy? Yes!
- What the hell is that?

25:15.474 --> 25:17.142
- Who is crazy?
- Hey!

25:17.226 --> 25:20.562
Who is crazy, eh?

25:27.319 --> 25:30.280
I want to feel that every day
for the rest of my life.

25:30.989 --> 25:31.990
Freedom!

25:33.158 --> 25:36.411
Freedom!

25:48.841 --> 25:49.842
Freedom.

25:52.094 --> 25:53.971
Buy out the others.

25:54.054 --> 25:55.973
Benchmark, the banks. All of them.

25:59.810 --> 26:03.438
No IPO. No one telling us what to do.
No one looking over our shoulders.

26:03.522 --> 26:07.860
We only answer to each other.
And-- And we show them.

26:07.943 --> 26:10.988
We show them what crazy really looks like.

26:17.286 --> 26:18.287
What do you think?

26:21.456 --> 26:24.543
I think you have fortitude.

26:32.050 --> 26:34.595
Drink, drink!

26:46.648 --> 26:48.901
A round for the bar. Shots <i>por todos</i>.

26:49.610 --> 26:52.821
Shots <i>por todos</i>!

26:52.905 --> 26:56.867
- <i>Nosotros!</i>
- <i>Trabajamos!</i>

27:42.663 --> 27:43.789
Did you get it?

27:44.581 --> 27:45.791
- Yeah.
- Great.

27:45.874 --> 27:48.126
Did you see her Instagram?

28:00.097 --> 28:03.809
Yes, yes, very nice work.
Very nice work, team.

28:04.852 --> 28:05.978
I need to talk to you.

28:06.061 --> 28:08.021
Cammy Number Two. What do you want?

28:08.105 --> 28:09.106
I'm in a meeting.

28:10.107 --> 28:11.275
What's this?

28:13.735 --> 28:14.778
WeGrow.

28:14.862 --> 28:17.698
- We discussed this. No school.
- No, no.

28:17.781 --> 28:18.782
You discussed it.

28:18.866 --> 28:21.660
I listened,
and I decided not to take your advice.

28:21.743 --> 28:24.955
That's all it is, right? Advice?
We're doing everything on the board.

28:25.038 --> 28:26.790
- Adam.
- Everything. Yes?

28:26.874 --> 28:28.458
What do you wanna wear for CNBC?

28:28.542 --> 28:31.044
Gray Prada suit, white button-down,

28:31.128 --> 28:33.172
maybe the suede Gucci shoes?

28:33.255 --> 28:35.090
And I'll take your tie.

28:35.174 --> 28:36.175
Oh, you like it?

28:36.258 --> 28:39.428
Yeah, but ask Damian
if the stripes are okay.

28:39.511 --> 28:41.263
- I know that always drives him crazy.
- Adam,

28:41.346 --> 28:44.016
investors are trying to understand
our core business.

28:44.099 --> 28:47.352
It's a business that's losing
astronomical amounts of money.

28:47.436 --> 28:49.229
We can't start a new business now.

28:49.313 --> 28:55.110
Okay. That's too bad because
I just had an amazing idea.

28:55.819 --> 28:57.696
Oh, you'll love it.

28:59.990 --> 29:01.450
Here it is.

29:04.453 --> 29:05.454
WeGo.

29:06.371 --> 29:07.539
Here's the concept.

29:08.373 --> 29:11.835
We go back to work, okay?

29:11.919 --> 29:15.422
And you can get the fuck out of my office.

29:16.298 --> 29:19.134
- Great.
- Yes. Yes, it's good. Good.

29:21.720 --> 29:23.514
Okay, where were we?

29:27.059 --> 29:28.101
Page?

29:28.185 --> 29:29.520
Eighteen.

29:31.480 --> 29:33.607
Continue. Continue.

29:33.690 --> 29:37.194
Masa buys out the other investors
for 20 billion,

29:37.277 --> 29:40.155
which values WeWork at $47 billion,

29:40.239 --> 29:43.116
but he wants control
of the company post-buyout.

29:43.200 --> 29:45.994
No, no. I remain in control.

29:47.079 --> 29:48.914
Nonnegotiable. You understand?

29:48.997 --> 29:49.998
Yes.

29:55.921 --> 29:57.381
Let's go through these.

29:57.464 --> 29:58.757
Cam, we went through those.

29:58.841 --> 30:01.176
Then let's go through them again.

30:01.260 --> 30:04.137
Up, up.
Up, up.

30:15.899 --> 30:17.609
What is WeGrow's mission?

30:18.110 --> 30:21.029
It's the same as all the We companies.

30:21.113 --> 30:22.990
To elevate the world's consciousness.

30:23.073 --> 30:24.867
Maybe a little more specifically.

30:25.784 --> 30:31.790
The mission of WeGrow is to unleash
every person's superpower.

30:34.334 --> 30:35.836
And expand happiness.

30:37.671 --> 30:39.590
- Okay. Right.
- Okay.

30:39.673 --> 30:41.675
You know what?
Let's take it back a step.

30:41.758 --> 30:44.428
During a press release,
you kinda wanna stick with the basics.

30:44.511 --> 30:45.804
Well, obviously.

30:45.888 --> 30:49.266
So, the basic idea here is
WeGrow is a school.

30:49.349 --> 30:52.769
Well, it's really more of a practice
and a new approach to life.

30:54.062 --> 30:55.147
- Okay. Right.
- Okay.

30:57.441 --> 30:59.401
Who were your teachers?

31:01.445 --> 31:04.198
His Holiness the Dalai Lama
and Mother Nature.

31:06.074 --> 31:08.535
Damian! Stop fucking around.
Come on. I need you.

31:08.619 --> 31:10.495
- Come, come, come.
- Ada--

31:12.206 --> 31:13.624
Four. Three.

31:15.626 --> 31:17.794
Are you
New York's biggest leaseholder yet?

31:17.878 --> 31:21.131
We're about to close a deal
that will make us number one.

31:21.215 --> 31:25.636
Walter Isaacson recently
compared you to Steve Jobs. Is it--

31:25.719 --> 31:29.473
Walter is great. I'm thinking
about having him write my biography.

31:29.556 --> 31:31.767
That will put you
in some pretty rarefied company.

31:31.850 --> 31:34.478
Da Vinci. Einstein. Kissinger. Jobs.

31:34.561 --> 31:37.314
Does Neumann belong among names like that?

31:37.397 --> 31:40.108
- Da Vinci, Einstein-- Come on.
- No, no, no. Absolutely not.

31:40.192 --> 31:41.527
- Not yet. Oh.
- Not yet.

31:41.610 --> 31:42.611
Not yet.

31:42.694 --> 31:46.281
You have built the second most valuable
private company in America.

31:46.865 --> 31:49.117
Third most in the world.
It is a bona fide unicorn.

31:49.201 --> 31:51.954
Last year, your revenue doubled
to 1.8 billion.

31:52.037 --> 31:54.206
Now, but you did lose 1.9.

31:54.790 --> 31:57.125
What do you say to claims
that you'll never be profitable?

31:57.209 --> 32:01.004
It took Amazon, what,
nine years to make a profit.

32:01.755 --> 32:05.384
<i>At year eight, we're almost at breakeven,
so I'd say we're ahead of schedule.</i>

32:06.093 --> 32:07.886
<i>Is WeWork the next Amazon?</i>

32:07.970 --> 32:10.389
- Adam? When'd you get--
- <i>We're a trillion-dollar company.</i>

32:10.472 --> 32:13.225
<i>Do you know how long it takes a diamond
to be created?</i>

32:13.308 --> 32:14.893
I need to talk to you about earlier.

32:14.977 --> 32:16.728
<i>Between half a million
and four million years.</i>

32:16.812 --> 32:19.064
I was working with Damian
when you came in,

32:19.147 --> 32:21.525
and you just interrupted us, and it's--

32:21.608 --> 32:23.902
Watch how I handle this. Watch.

32:23.986 --> 32:26.363
<i>For three days in 1999,</i>

32:26.446 --> 32:29.157
<i>Masayoshi Son was the richest man
in the world,</i>

32:29.241 --> 32:31.869
<i>and he will be again because of WeWork.</i>

32:32.578 --> 32:35.163
- <i>Thank you, Mr. Neumann.</i>
- <i>Thank you very much.</i>

32:35.247 --> 32:38.375
<i>Last year, your revenue doubled
to 1.8 billion.</i>

32:38.458 --> 32:40.419
<i>Now, but you did lose 1.9.</i>

32:40.502 --> 32:43.088
<i>What do you say to claims
that you'll never be profitable?</i>

32:47.593 --> 32:49.511
He insists on control.

32:50.137 --> 32:55.726
And he would prohibit you from investing
in competing real estate ventures.

32:55.809 --> 32:57.978
He presumes to tell us
what we can invest in?

32:58.687 --> 33:02.191
They are burning through cash
at an alarming rate.

33:02.608 --> 33:05.611
And with the downward pressure
on our stock price

33:05.694 --> 33:08.614
Son-san, we should not do this deal.

33:08.697 --> 33:10.157
The terms are unfavorable.

33:11.783 --> 33:13.619
Then we improve the terms.

33:26.798 --> 33:27.799
He's coming!

33:34.056 --> 33:35.265
Louder. Louder.

33:35.349 --> 33:36.350
Masa's counter.

33:38.060 --> 33:40.646
- How is it?
- They pushed back. Hard.

33:40.729 --> 33:42.981
Well, then we push back harder, okay?

33:43.065 --> 33:46.026
And then they push back, and we push back,
and they push back again.

33:46.109 --> 33:48.987
- That's why it's called a negotiation.
- They are not messing around.

33:49.071 --> 33:50.948
Not with this pressure
on their share price.

33:51.031 --> 33:52.366
We should accept.

33:52.449 --> 33:53.700
Listen to me, Matthew.

33:53.784 --> 33:58.413
Masa respects crazy. You understand?
Crazy. Push back!

33:58.497 --> 33:59.581
On what?

34:00.499 --> 34:02.084
Everything.

34:02.167 --> 34:03.710
We must have fortitude.

34:05.128 --> 34:06.255
Louder!

34:16.556 --> 34:19.476
Make the beast
a beautiful man, Bobby.

34:19.560 --> 34:20.561
You got it.

34:23.605 --> 34:25.315
8.9.

34:27.025 --> 34:29.902
8.9.

34:30.612 --> 34:34.157
8.9!

34:34.241 --> 34:38.996
- Hey! Oh!
- Eight point fucking nine!

34:45.835 --> 34:47.337
Behold!

34:48.338 --> 34:54.094
With this lease, we just passed
8.9 million square feet!

34:57.054 --> 35:01.351
WeWork now controls the most
square footage in all of New York City!

35:01.435 --> 35:02.728
- Wow!
- Yeah!

35:02.811 --> 35:06.148
And we are going to party!

35:09.234 --> 35:14.072
Yes! Yes! Yes!

35:14.156 --> 35:16.909
Nice and straight in the back, Bobby.

35:16.992 --> 35:18.035
Nice and straight.

35:18.118 --> 35:20.954
Adam, Lars called from SoftBank.

35:21.038 --> 35:24.583
Masa wants you to meet with somebody
named Khaldoon Khalifa Al Mubarak.

35:24.666 --> 35:26.919
He's head of Abu Dhabi's
sovereign wealth fund.

35:27.002 --> 35:28.212
Put it in my calendar.

35:28.295 --> 35:31.840
But Abu Dhabi's not gonna let SoftBank
invest any more money in WeWork.

35:31.924 --> 35:35.010
You have to meet with him and impress him.
He said it's very important.

35:35.093 --> 35:38.805
Tell him not to worry. I'll knock
Mubarak's kandura off, you understand?

35:38.889 --> 35:40.682
I'll make his agal spin like a top.

35:40.766 --> 35:43.393
- Okay.
- Hey. Now, I want you to plan a party.

35:44.102 --> 35:45.229
- A what?
- A party.

35:45.312 --> 35:48.524
A party for being
New York's biggest leaseholder.

35:48.607 --> 35:51.527
- Okay.
- Yes. And see if we can get will.i.am.

35:56.490 --> 35:59.576
"Neumann, WeWork's messianic CEO,

35:59.660 --> 36:02.454
says the brave new world
of the gig economy is reshap"--

36:02.538 --> 36:05.374
Messianic, like, messiah?

36:06.250 --> 36:07.417
Yes.

36:08.043 --> 36:10.712
Phil, do you think that I'm messianic?

36:11.213 --> 36:13.715
- Be honest.
- Yeah. Yeah, I do.

36:14.591 --> 36:18.011
"Now, Neumann spends his Mondays
at WeWork HQ"…

36:20.472 --> 36:21.473
True.

36:22.558 --> 36:25.185
"Topped off with shots of tequila
for the entire staff."

37:43.472 --> 37:47.059
Hey, Adam, you're set for tomorrow
at The Mercer with Al Mubarak.

37:47.142 --> 37:48.227
Who is that?

37:49.019 --> 37:50.979
The head of Abu Dhabi's
sovereign wealth fund.

37:51.063 --> 37:52.689
You had that call with SoftBank about him.

37:53.899 --> 37:56.485
Al Mubarak. He's one of
the Vision Fund's biggest investors.

37:56.568 --> 37:58.820
He said has doubts about WeWork.

37:59.696 --> 38:02.491
And he won't when I get done with him.

38:02.574 --> 38:04.868
Okay, how is the party planning coming?

38:04.952 --> 38:07.287
Did you get the Black Eyed Peas
or will.i.am or--

38:07.371 --> 38:10.082
Trading phone calls. Stuff like that.

38:11.750 --> 38:13.794
What is the board doing here?

38:16.547 --> 38:19.424
If I had known you were coming,
I would have put out muffins.

38:19.508 --> 38:21.552
- Have a seat.
- I was planning on it.

38:21.635 --> 38:23.929
So, how can I help you?

38:26.306 --> 38:27.307
Adam…

38:29.434 --> 38:33.063
you're not really fit to be CEO
of a public company, are you?

38:35.440 --> 38:38.026
You see, WeWork has grown,

38:38.861 --> 38:40.279
and Adam hasn't.

38:40.362 --> 38:43.782
You know, I'm not talking
about the tequila

38:43.866 --> 38:46.410
and the cock and balls in the Zen garden

38:46.493 --> 38:48.287
and all that adolescent bullshit.

38:48.370 --> 38:50.497
No. I'm talking about this.

38:52.291 --> 38:53.500
This.

38:53.584 --> 38:56.628
Got 55 Chrystie Street, 189 Lispenard.

38:56.712 --> 39:01.758
These are buildings that are owned by Adam
and are leased back to WeWork.

39:01.842 --> 39:05.262
How is he negotiating the best terms
for the company

39:05.345 --> 39:08.015
if he's negotiating against himself?

39:08.599 --> 39:11.476
He trademarked the word "we"

39:12.895 --> 39:17.524
and then sold it to the company
for $5.9 million.

39:17.608 --> 39:19.026
That's your money.

39:19.610 --> 39:23.197
Turmeric coffee creamer company
and a wave pool company,

39:23.280 --> 39:28.327
and now his wife's quite frankly insane
vanity project, a school.

39:28.410 --> 39:29.953
Hands up if anybody can tell me

39:30.037 --> 39:34.583
why a shared workspace company
is building a school.

39:40.214 --> 39:43.133
What are you waiting for?

39:45.302 --> 39:48.972
Are you waiting for gasps of shock?

39:51.183 --> 39:54.770
I told you. I said the board knew
about every single transaction.

39:54.853 --> 39:56.688
They didn't object to any of it.

39:56.772 --> 39:59.733
Yes, you know,
they did give you a lot of rope,

39:59.816 --> 40:02.611
and you hung yourself with it.

40:02.694 --> 40:04.321
Right? He's very charming,

40:04.404 --> 40:09.326
but we stand to lose or gain billions

40:09.409 --> 40:11.370
based on this moment.

40:12.996 --> 40:14.998
Let's get rid of the rotting corpse.

40:15.541 --> 40:16.959
Remove him as CEO.

40:20.045 --> 40:23.507
Where were you when we were
screwing together desks ten years ago?

40:24.675 --> 40:29.388
Or when I was flying
from Jaipur to Hanoi to Shanghai

40:29.471 --> 40:30.889
trying to expand into Asia?

40:30.973 --> 40:32.266
Where were you?

40:33.058 --> 40:35.435
You don't want me here? Okay. Okay.

40:35.519 --> 40:37.229
Who is going to run this company?

40:37.855 --> 40:40.357
Is it him? Miguel?

40:41.608 --> 40:42.693
Miguel?

40:44.570 --> 40:45.571
Good luck.

40:46.154 --> 40:49.116
Find another person
who can walk into a room

40:49.199 --> 40:52.619
and come out 12 minutes later
with $4 billion.

40:52.703 --> 40:56.164
I'm a golden fucking goose
laying golden fucking eggs.

40:56.248 --> 40:59.209
And I'm going to make every single one
of you filthy fucking rich.

40:59.293 --> 41:00.836
So let's do it. Let's do it.

41:01.587 --> 41:04.464
Let's vote on Cam's motion.
No, no. Let's do it.

41:05.132 --> 41:06.425
- All in favor!
- Great.

41:06.508 --> 41:08.302
All in favor!

41:08.385 --> 41:10.554
Let's go. Good.
Come, come, come, come, come.

41:15.392 --> 41:17.102
Yes, well, there it is.

41:17.186 --> 41:19.563
5-4 in favor of you fucking off.

41:20.606 --> 41:21.607
Meeting adjourned.

41:21.690 --> 41:23.025
Muffins on the way.

41:35.329 --> 41:38.207
Adam, you're not a golden goose.

41:39.374 --> 41:41.043
You just have fortitude.

42:07.569 --> 42:11.865
Again! Again! Again!

42:11.949 --> 42:16.328
Again! Again! Again! Again!

42:16.411 --> 42:22.125
- Yeah! Yes! Again! Again!
- WeWork! WeWork! WeWork! WeWork!

42:22.209 --> 42:27.256
- Again! Yes! Yeah!
- WeWork! WeWork!

42:30.384 --> 42:32.094
Yes! Yeah!

42:35.597 --> 42:39.726
Yes! Yes! Yes!

42:45.524 --> 42:48.193
WeWork! WeWork! WeWork!

43:22.352 --> 43:24.396
You're gonna be there tomorrow, right?

43:26.940 --> 43:28.150
For what?

43:30.694 --> 43:33.906
Tomorrow is the first day of WeGrow.
You're talking to the kids.

44:08.649 --> 44:09.733
Adam.

44:10.692 --> 44:12.653
Adam. Adam.

44:14.154 --> 44:15.197
Adam, you need to wake up.

44:15.781 --> 44:18.033
- Who is it?
- It's me. Birdie.

44:18.116 --> 44:21.119
It's 11:23.
You have the meeting with Al Mubarak.

44:21.203 --> 44:22.579
Masa's investor.

44:22.663 --> 44:24.248
- Who?
- You're gonna miss it. We have to go.

44:25.415 --> 44:27.584
- Sh--
- We have to go.

44:27.668 --> 44:30.045
Sheikh, my deepest apologies.

44:30.128 --> 44:32.339
Please, excuse me.

44:32.422 --> 44:34.341
I hope they're treating you well.

44:36.510 --> 44:38.262
He was 45 minutes late.

44:38.345 --> 44:43.058
Saudi Arabia and now Abu Dhabi refuse
to allow us to invest more money in him.

44:43.141 --> 44:46.019
His demands in the negotiation
have been infuriating.

44:46.103 --> 44:47.437
He is like a child.

44:47.521 --> 44:50.148
He's been spoiled long enough.

44:50.232 --> 44:52.734
Son-san, we must put an end to this.

45:01.201 --> 45:04.580
Masa! It's your prodigal son.

45:04.663 --> 45:09.001
Listen, I had a small scheduling problem
with Mubarak,

45:09.084 --> 45:11.378
but call me back.

45:11.461 --> 45:14.381
Not a big deal.
Call me back. Call me day or night.

45:15.465 --> 45:18.010
Agree to their terms.
Close it up. Close it.

45:20.304 --> 45:21.305
Did Masa call?

45:21.388 --> 45:23.682
- No, he didn't. But you do have--
- Listen.

45:23.765 --> 45:26.059
Only get me for Masa.

45:26.602 --> 45:27.978
For Masa. That's it.

45:30.606 --> 45:34.401
So, here at WeGrow,
we place equal priority

45:34.484 --> 45:39.865
on your mental, physical,
and spiritual development.

45:39.948 --> 45:42.618
However you learn is just fine.

45:50.542 --> 45:51.543
Call Adam's office again.

45:53.712 --> 45:57.591
Okay, while we wait
for our very special guest,

45:58.258 --> 46:00.385
why don't we go around the circle,

46:00.469 --> 46:02.596
and everyone can say
what their superpower is.

46:02.679 --> 46:04.515
Okay, yes, what's your superpower?

46:11.188 --> 46:12.105
Masa?

46:12.189 --> 46:13.857
You have to be at WeGrow
in three minutes.

46:13.941 --> 46:15.192
Oh, shit.

46:15.275 --> 46:16.985
Why didn't you tell me?

46:18.320 --> 46:20.906
Remember to always follow your passions

46:20.989 --> 46:23.033
and never do anything you don't love

46:23.116 --> 46:24.868
and, and…

46:25.619 --> 46:29.540
fight to the death for everything
that you do, you understand?

46:30.499 --> 46:31.333
All right.

46:35.963 --> 46:39.508
All right, all right, well,
I'm sure we all can agree

46:39.591 --> 46:43.220
that those inspiring words
from Mr. Neumann came

46:43.303 --> 46:44.972
better late than never.

46:45.055 --> 46:48.016
So, teachers, if you could please
gather your students

46:48.100 --> 46:49.893
and please take them to the music corner.

46:49.977 --> 46:53.981
Parents, you are welcome to join in
for this very, very special day.

46:54.064 --> 46:55.941
Thank you so much.

46:57.901 --> 46:59.528
Will you come with me
for a moment, please?

46:59.611 --> 47:01.363
Of course. Yeah, of course.

47:01.905 --> 47:04.575
How about I come to
one of your board meetings in a bathrobe?

47:04.658 --> 47:06.743
Don't be dramatic, okay?

47:06.827 --> 47:08.287
Can we not do this here?

47:08.370 --> 47:10.247
- Here of all places.
- Oh, okay. Okay.

47:10.330 --> 47:11.874
Then when are we supposed to do it?

47:11.957 --> 47:14.710
When you come home
in the middle of the night, shit-faced?

47:14.793 --> 47:16.920
That happened twice. Twice.

47:17.004 --> 47:18.630
You're gonna destroy everything
we have built.

47:18.714 --> 47:20.132
- You can't--
- We built? We built?

47:20.215 --> 47:21.300
Did you say, "we built"?

47:21.383 --> 47:23.135
I built this. I built it.

47:23.218 --> 47:26.096
You, you just take and take and take
and take and take.

47:26.180 --> 47:28.015
You wanted to be an actor.

47:28.682 --> 47:29.808
I gave you a theater.

47:29.892 --> 47:32.311
You wanted to be an executive.
I gave you a job.

47:32.394 --> 47:34.062
You wanted to be an educator.

47:34.146 --> 47:37.149
I built you a fucking school.

47:37.232 --> 47:39.318
You, you think you built this?

47:39.401 --> 47:41.028
You built shit.

47:46.783 --> 47:48.243
I'm--

47:49.161 --> 47:50.662
No.

47:59.171 --> 48:02.466
All right, listen up!
All right, you beautiful people!

48:03.008 --> 48:08.305
I just want to do a toast
to 8.9 million square feet!

48:13.727 --> 48:15.562
8.9!

48:15.646 --> 48:20.651
8.9! 8.9! 8.9!

48:23.070 --> 48:26.240
Masa! Finally!
I've been trying to reach you.

48:26.323 --> 48:27.824
Good to hear your voice.

48:27.908 --> 48:28.909
Listen to me.

48:28.992 --> 48:32.287
There was a small scheduling error
with Al Mubarak.

48:32.371 --> 48:35.040
Nothing really.
You're probably not even be aware of it.

48:35.541 --> 48:37.709
- Nothing to be concerned about.
- <i>Adam.</i>

48:37.793 --> 48:41.380
Listen, if he was upset at all,
it's easy to fix.

48:41.463 --> 48:42.840
I'll jump on the plane tomorrow.

48:42.923 --> 48:43.924
- I'll be there tomorrow.
- <i>Adam.</i>

48:44.007 --> 48:45.801
<i>I'll knock his socks off, you understand?</i>

48:45.884 --> 48:48.387
I cannot move forward with Fortitude.

48:48.470 --> 48:49.471
I'm sorry.

49:40.063 --> 49:45.068
8.9! 8.9! 8.9!

49:45.152 --> 49:48.197
8.9! 8.9!

49:48.280 --> 49:53.493
- Yeah, baby! We love you.
- Yeah, baby! You, man.

49:53.577 --> 49:55.454
You! You, man!

49:55.537 --> 50:01.418
<i>8.9! 8.9! 8.9! 8.9!</i>

51:02.187 --> 51:03.647
Fuck me.
