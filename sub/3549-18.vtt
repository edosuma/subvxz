WEBVTT

00:00.671 --> 00:02.133
PREVIOUSLY ON...

00:02.133 --> 00:04.505
A THIEF WAS CONFRONTED.
 WELL, MAYBE YOU'LL FEEL

00:04.505 --> 00:07.138
COMFORTABLE TALKING
TO A PROFESSIONAL.
 A PSYCHIATRIST?

00:07.138 --> 00:11.142
SOMEONE LIGHT ME A CIGAR.
 CARLOS HIRED
A OLD GIRLFRIEND...

00:11.142 --> 00:14.315
AND GABY HIRED A SPY.
 I TALKED TO CARLOS. YOU'RE IN!

00:14.315 --> 00:16.317
EDIE DUG DEEPER
INTO DAVE'S PAST.

00:16.317 --> 00:18.619
KILLED THREE YEARS AGO--
CAR CRASH.

00:18.619 --> 00:21.192
THAT WAS HIS WIFE.
GIVE ME THAT ONE.

00:21.192 --> 00:23.194
THEIR DAUGHTER DIED
IN THE SAME CRASH.

00:23.194 --> 00:26.397
AND DAVE'S MASTER PLAN...
 YOU REALLY THINK I MAKE

00:26.397 --> 00:29.100
THAT MUCH OF A DIFFERENCE
IN MIKE'S LIFE?
 IF HE EVER LOST YOU,

00:29.100 --> 00:30.801
IT WOULD DESTROY HIM.

00:30.801 --> 00:34.105
ENTERED ITS FINAL PHASE.

00:37.768 --> 00:39.810
UH, HI. IS THIS
THE RANGER STATION?

00:39.810 --> 00:42.813
WELL, I DIDN'T KNOW WHETHER
TO CALL YOU OR FISH AND GAME,

00:42.813 --> 00:45.816
BUT, UH, I THINK I SAW SOME GUYS
UP AT EMERSON WOODS

00:45.816 --> 00:47.818
HUNTING ILLEGALLY,
AND I GOT WORRIED

00:47.818 --> 00:50.821
BECAUSE I KNOW PEOPLE LIKE
TO GO CAMPING UP THERE,

00:50.821 --> 00:54.125
AND I-I SURE WOULDN'T
WANT ANYONE TO GET HURT.

00:54.125 --> 00:56.687
OH. NO, NO NEED TO THANK ME.

00:56.687 --> 01:00.191
I'M JUST DOING MY PART
AS A CONCERNED CITIZEN.

01:00.191 --> 01:02.062
BYE NOW.

01:04.095 --> 01:06.066
(Mary Alice) DAVE WILLIAMS

01:06.066 --> 01:09.640
HAD BEEN PLANNING THE MURDER
FOR YEARS.
 (door bells jingle)

01:09.640 --> 01:14.405
AND LIKE ALL THE BEST PLANS,
IT WAS A SIMPLE ONE.

01:14.405 --> 01:16.807
FIRST, HE WOULD GUIDE

01:16.807 --> 01:18.849
MIKE DELFINO
AND KATHERINE MAYFAIR

01:18.849 --> 01:21.612
TO A REMOTE CABIN.

01:21.612 --> 01:25.256
THE NEXT MORNING,
HE'D PRETEND TO BE ASLEEP

01:25.256 --> 01:30.261
AS THE TWO LOVERS
LEFT TO GO HIKING.

01:30.261 --> 01:33.494
DAVE WOULD THEN GRAB THE GUN
HE'D CAREFULLY HIDDEN...

01:33.494 --> 01:34.865
(click)

01:34.865 --> 01:38.769
AND START TO FOLLOW HIS QUARRY.

01:38.769 --> 01:41.832
HE'D WAIT UNTIL THE TWO
HAD PAUSED FOR A MOMENT

01:41.832 --> 01:43.774
TO CATCH THEIR BREATHS.

01:43.774 --> 01:46.106
AND THEN
HE'D PULL THE TRIGGER...

01:46.106 --> 01:46.877
(gunshot)

01:48.839 --> 01:54.145
BREAKING THE HEART OF THE MAN
WHO HAD KILLED HIS WIFE.

01:54.145 --> 01:56.247
WHEN THE RANGERS ARRIVED,

01:56.247 --> 02:00.791
THEY WOULD MENTION THE REPORTS
OF ILLEGAL HUNTERS IN THE AREA.

02:00.791 --> 02:03.854
AND DAVE WOULD DRIVE MIKE
BACK HOME,

02:03.854 --> 02:07.898
ALL THE WHILE
ENJOYING HIS PAIN.

02:07.898 --> 02:10.461
YES,

02:10.461 --> 02:12.633
DAVE WILLIAMS HAD COME UP

02:12.633 --> 02:16.136
WITH A VERY SIMPLE PLAN.

02:16.136 --> 02:17.838
UGH!

02:17.838 --> 02:22.142
BUT AS HE WAS ABOUT
TO DISCOVER...

02:22.142 --> 02:24.445
HAVE YOU FAXED THIS CLIPPING
TO EDIE WILLIAMS YET?

02:24.445 --> 02:26.447
UM, DOING IT RIGHT NOW.

02:26.447 --> 02:28.719
THERE IS NOTHING SIMPLE...

02:28.719 --> 02:30.221
(punches buttons)

02:30.221 --> 02:32.223
(beep)
 ABOUT MURDER.

02:32.223 --> 02:35.226
(whirring)

02:49.169 --> 02:52.243
LIFE IS FULL
OF NASTY SHOCKS...

02:52.243 --> 02:53.204
(electric zap)

02:53.204 --> 02:54.545
(gasps)

02:54.545 --> 02:57.548
UNPLEASANT SURPRISES
THAT JOLT OUR SYSTEMS...

02:57.548 --> 02:58.879
(electricity pops)

02:58.879 --> 03:01.752
AND CAUSE OUR HEARTS
TO SKIP A BEAT.

03:01.752 --> 03:03.254
(electricity crackles)

03:03.254 --> 03:07.218
AND THESE SHOCKS
ALWAYS OCCUR...

03:07.218 --> 03:08.489
SUSAN?
 HEY, KARL.

03:08.489 --> 03:10.921
WHEN WE LEAST EXPECT THEM.

03:10.921 --> 03:11.862
KARL.

03:11.862 --> 03:13.864
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

03:13.864 --> 03:15.896
WELL, I JUST ENROLLED EVAN.

03:15.896 --> 03:17.268
WOW.

03:17.268 --> 03:18.799
AND I WAS WORRIED

03:18.799 --> 03:21.302
THAT WE'D BE OUT
OF EACH OTHER'S LIVES FOREVER.

03:21.302 --> 03:23.203
MM, LUCKY, LUCKY.

03:23.203 --> 03:26.737
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
 I AM AN ART TEACHER.

03:26.737 --> 03:29.280
REALLY? DO THEY KNOW THAT?

03:29.280 --> 03:33.414
AND NOW I'M IGNORING YOU
AND MOVING ON TO EVAN.

03:33.414 --> 03:35.446
HELLO, EVAN.

03:35.446 --> 03:36.917
EVAN, THIS IS SUSAN.

03:36.917 --> 03:38.919
SHE'S YOUR SISTER JULIE'S
MOTHER.

03:38.919 --> 03:42.253
WE USED TO BE MARRIED.
SHE WAS A LOT YOUNGER THEN.

03:42.253 --> 03:45.796
EVAN, WHY DON'T YOU
HEAD INTO THE CLASSROOM?

03:45.796 --> 03:48.299
I NEED TO TALK
TO YOUR DADDY,

03:48.299 --> 03:51.762
AND I MAY NEED TO USE SOME
GROWN-UP WORDS. (chuckles)

03:51.762 --> 03:53.904
OKAY, SUSIE Q.,
WHAT'S WRONG?

03:53.904 --> 03:57.508
GET IT OFF THAT CHEST
YOU WOULDN'T LET ME ENHANCE.

03:57.508 --> 03:58.969
LISTEN, IT'S BAD ENOUGH

03:58.969 --> 04:01.942
THAT I'VE GOT ONE EX-HUSBAND
RUNNING AROUND THE HALLS.

04:01.942 --> 04:04.945
I DON'T NEED THE FACULTY
AND THE PARENTS

04:04.945 --> 04:06.947
KNOWING THAT I HAVE TWO.

04:06.947 --> 04:09.650
SO NOT A WORD ABOUT
US HAVING BEEN MARRIED.

04:09.650 --> 04:12.423
NO MORE WISECRACKS.
NO SUSIE Q's.

04:12.423 --> 04:16.286
I AM MISS SUSAN,
ART TEACHER.

04:16.286 --> 04:17.827
YES, MISS SUSAN.

04:18.959 --> 04:22.693
CAN I BANG YOUR ERASERS
AFTER CLASS?

04:22.693 --> 04:24.995
KARL, I'M SERIOUS.
DON'T MESS WITH ME.

04:24.995 --> 04:28.899
I HAVE A YARDSTICK,
AND I'M NOT AFRAID TO USE IT.

04:28.899 --> 04:30.741
(chuckles)

04:30.741 --> 04:33.874
WE'RE GONNA BE
MAKING A PRESENTATION

04:33.874 --> 04:36.547
FOR THE MORRISON CONTRACT
SOONER THAN WE PLANNED.

04:36.547 --> 04:39.410
THERE ARE A LOT OF FIRMS
GUNNING FOR THIS,

04:39.410 --> 04:41.552
AND--DAMN IT, LYNETTE!
DON'T--DON'T TOUCH MY FIGURINES.

04:41.552 --> 04:43.984
THESE ARE WORTH MORE
THAN THE HOUSE YOU LIVE IN.

04:43.984 --> 04:47.057
BIG DEAL.
SO IS THIS COFFEE MUG.

04:47.057 --> 04:49.920
ALL RIGHT, WE SHOULD
BREAK FOR LUNCH.

04:49.920 --> 04:52.323
NO. UNTIL THIS DEAL CLOSES,
WE WORK THROUGH LUNCH.

04:52.323 --> 04:55.866
BUT AS A CONSOLATION,
WE'LL ALSO BE WORKING NIGHTS.

04:55.866 --> 04:58.329
NIGHTS? YOU REALLY THINK
THAT'S NECESSARY?

04:58.329 --> 05:02.002
THIS IS A $10 MILLION DEAL,
CARLOS. HOW BAD DO YOU WANT IT?

05:02.002 --> 05:05.005
YOU HEARD THE WOMAN. (sighs)
WE'RE WORKING NIGHTS.

05:05.005 --> 05:09.079
UM, I HAVE
A TINY SCHEDULING CONFLICT.

05:09.079 --> 05:11.712
I COACH MY DAUGHTER'S BASKETBALL
TEAM ON FRIDAY NIGHTS.

05:11.712 --> 05:14.715
SO IF I COULD--
 FRIDAY NIGHTS
ARE NOW WORK NIGHTS.

05:14.715 --> 05:16.647
IF WE'RE SUCCESSFUL,

05:16.647 --> 05:19.650
THOSE OF YOU ON COMMISSION
STAND TO DO VERY WELL.

05:19.650 --> 05:22.723
AND THOSE OF YOU WHO AREN'T?
WELL, YOU GET TO KEEP YOUR JOBS,

05:22.723 --> 05:26.557
WHICH, IN THIS ECONOMY,
IS A BONUS ALL BY ITSELF.

05:28.399 --> 05:30.931
ALL RIGHT, LET'S RUN DOWN
TO THE DELI, GRAB A SANDWICH

05:30.931 --> 05:32.963
AND MEET BACK HERE IN FIVE.

05:32.963 --> 05:35.035
YOU.

05:35.035 --> 05:36.367
NO TOUCHING.

05:37.468 --> 05:40.010
AND, YES, I'LL KNOW.

05:41.942 --> 05:44.515
ISN'T SHE FUN?

05:44.515 --> 05:46.346
(chuckles)

05:46.346 --> 05:48.449
HEY, CARLOS.

05:48.449 --> 05:50.951
DID I EVER TELL YOU

05:50.951 --> 05:53.484
THAT TOM AND I SERIOUSLY
CONSIDERED YOU AND GABY

05:53.484 --> 05:56.387
FOR PENNY'S GODPARENTS?
 YOU'RE NOT GETTING
FRIDAY NIGHTS OFF.

05:56.387 --> 05:59.560
LOOK, I'M NOT HAPPY
ABOUT THE SCHEDULE EITHER.

05:59.560 --> 06:02.633
I'M MISSING MY KIDS, TOO.
 THEN DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT.

06:02.633 --> 06:06.096
YOU'RE THE PRESIDENT.
PUT THE BRAKES ON LUCY.
 LYNETTE, I HIRED HER
TO CRACK THE WHIP,

06:06.096 --> 06:09.099
AND THAT'S WHAT SHE'S DOING.
IT'S GOOD FOR THE COMPANY.

06:09.099 --> 06:11.101
(lowers voice)
BUT SHE MAKES PEOPLE CRAZY.

06:11.101 --> 06:14.805
CAN'T YOU TALK TO HER,
GET HER TO DIAL IT DOWN A BIT?
 I WILL THINK ABOUT IT.

06:14.805 --> 06:16.907
BUT DON'T BE ASKING ME
FOR FAVORS LIKE THIS.

06:16.907 --> 06:19.410
WHEN WE'RE AT THE OFFICE,
I'M NOT YOUR NEIGHBOR,

06:19.410 --> 06:21.011
I'M NOT YOUR FRIEND.

06:21.011 --> 06:23.914
I'M YOUR BOSS. GOT IT?

06:23.914 --> 06:25.486
OH, BY THE WAY,

06:25.486 --> 06:28.489
YOU AND TOM ARE COMING OVER
FOR COCKTAILS ON SATURDAY.

06:28.489 --> 06:32.923
OH, YEAH. I PLAN TO GET DRUNK
AND BITCH ABOUT MY BOSS.

06:34.965 --> 06:38.128
I'M SORRY,
BUT THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE.

06:38.128 --> 06:41.001
DO YOU AT LEAST
KNOW WHY HE STEALS?

06:41.001 --> 06:42.703
IF THERE WERE

06:42.703 --> 06:44.705
SOME SORDID CHILDHOOD TRAUMA
WE COULD BLAME IT ON,

06:44.705 --> 06:47.738
IT WOULD REALLY HELP ME OUT
WITH THE NEIGHBORS.
 OH, HE KNOWS.

06:47.738 --> 06:51.011
DR. BERNSTEIN UNCOVERED THAT
MY VERY FIRST SESSION.

06:51.011 --> 06:53.484
REALLY? AND--AND YET
HE KEEPS CHARGING ME.

06:53.484 --> 06:55.986
SO, DOCTOR,
WHAT'S THIS "REVELATION"

06:55.986 --> 06:58.749
THAT YOU'VE BEEN KEEPING FROM ME
FOR $200 AN HOUR?

07:01.091 --> 07:05.055
I STEAL TO HURT YOU.

07:05.055 --> 07:08.198
WHY WOULD YOU WANT
TO HURT ME?

07:08.198 --> 07:10.901
EACH DAY FOR THE PAST YEAR,

07:10.901 --> 07:13.704
YOU HAVE, INCH BY INCH,

07:13.704 --> 07:15.906
SLICE BY SLICE,

07:15.906 --> 07:19.069
BROUGHT ME CLOSER
TO BEING A EUNUCH.

07:21.111 --> 07:23.844
WOULD YOU EXCUSE US
FOR MOMENT?

07:23.844 --> 07:26.517
THIS JUST BECAME
A PRIVATE CONVERSATION.

07:26.517 --> 07:28.849
IF I STAY,
I MIGHT BE ABLE TO HELP.

07:28.849 --> 07:30.150
YOU WANNA HELP?

07:30.150 --> 07:33.153
WHY DON'T YOU GO DOWN
TO THE PHARMACY IN THE LOBBY

07:33.153 --> 07:34.885
AND BUY SOME ASPIRIN?

07:34.885 --> 07:36.557
I'M GONNA NEED IT.

07:40.130 --> 07:41.461
(exhales deeply)

07:41.461 --> 07:43.463
(door opens and closes)

07:43.463 --> 07:44.995
(sighs)

07:46.737 --> 07:48.098
I DON'T DESERVE THIS.

07:48.098 --> 07:50.240
I HAVE BEEN NOTHING
BUT SUPPORTIVE OF YOU

07:50.240 --> 07:52.242
SINCE YOU GOT OUT OF JAIL.

07:52.242 --> 07:55.005
I EVEN GAVE YOU A JOB.

07:55.005 --> 07:57.608
(scoffs) I WANTED TO BE
YOUR PARTNER.

07:57.608 --> 07:59.580
YOU MADE ME AN EMPLOYEE.

07:59.580 --> 08:03.554
SO YOU DECIDED TO PUNISH ME
BY RESORTING TO PETTY THEFT?

08:03.554 --> 08:06.657
FOR GOD SAKES, ORSON,
I'M YOUR WIFE.

08:06.657 --> 08:09.159
PERHAPS, BUT I'M NOT
YOUR HUSBAND.

08:09.159 --> 08:13.493
WE MAY SHARE A BED, BUT YOU SAVE
YOUR PASSION FOR YOUR COMPANY.

08:13.493 --> 08:15.826
THAT'S NOT TRUE!
 ISN'T IT?

08:15.826 --> 08:19.530
EVERY DAY FOR THE PAST YEAR,
I HAVE BEEN IN THE BACKGROUND,

08:19.530 --> 08:21.031
AN AFTERTHOUGHT,

08:21.031 --> 08:24.504
WHILE YOU SPEND DAY AND NIGHT
NURTURING YOUR BUSINESS.

08:24.504 --> 08:27.507
ALL THE WHILE THINKING
I HAD YOUR SUPPORT.

08:27.507 --> 08:29.009
I TRIED.

08:29.009 --> 08:33.283
I THOUGHT I WOULDN'T MIND
BEING MR. BREE VAN DE KAMP.

08:33.283 --> 08:35.946
BUT IT'S KILLING ME.

08:35.946 --> 08:40.020
EVERY DAY, I GET SMALLER
AND SMALLER.

08:40.020 --> 08:44.024
AND IF SOMETHING
DOESN'T CHANGE,

08:44.024 --> 08:48.298
ORSON HODGE IS JUST GONNA
DISAPPEAR ALTOGETHER.

08:50.831 --> 08:54.134
(sighs) GIRLS ARE OUT
LIKE A LIGHT. THANKS FOR DINNER.

08:54.134 --> 08:57.137
CARLOS, DO YOU HAVE TO
GO BACK TO WORK?
 GABY, I GOT A MEETING.

08:57.137 --> 09:01.942
BUT CAN'T LUCY COVER IT?
 YOU KNOW THOSE TWO EXTRAS ZEROES
AT THE END OF MY PAYCHECK

09:01.942 --> 09:04.074
YOU LIKE SO MUCH? THEY'RE THERE
BECAUSE I'M PRESIDENT.

09:04.074 --> 09:06.577
HOURS ARE PART OF THE GIG.

09:06.577 --> 09:09.119
HEY. HOW ABOUT A QUICKIE?

09:09.119 --> 09:11.321
BABE, I DON'T HAVE TIME.

09:11.321 --> 09:15.255
RIGHT, THAT'S WHY I DIDN'T
SUGGEST A LONGIE. OH, COME ON.

09:15.255 --> 09:17.257
I'LL HAVE YOUR EYES
ROLLING BACK IN YOUR HEAD

09:17.257 --> 09:21.091
IN THREE MINUTES FLAT.
 YOU WANNA DO IT THERE IN FRONT
OF THE KIDS' SIPPY CUPS?

09:23.764 --> 09:24.935
(thud)

09:24.935 --> 09:26.066
ALL GONE.

09:26.066 --> 09:29.569
NOW LET'S DO THIS.
IT'LL BE LIKE OLD TIMES.

09:29.569 --> 09:31.842
WE NEVER DID IT
ON THE TABLE.

09:31.842 --> 09:34.745
YEAH, WE DID, YEARS AGO.
DON'T YOU REMEMBER?

09:36.346 --> 09:39.209
I DON'T THINK THAT WAS ME.

09:39.209 --> 09:41.181
OH. RIGHT.

09:41.181 --> 09:43.684
WELL, WE'LL CREATE
NEW TABLE MEMORIES.

09:43.684 --> 09:46.687
IF YOU'RE TRYING TO TURN ME ON,
YOU JUST FAILED MISERABLY.

09:46.687 --> 09:49.159
(scoffs) CARLOS, DO YOU
REALIZE SINCE BRADLEY DIED

09:49.159 --> 09:51.161
AND YOU TOOK OVER,
WE HAVEN'T HAD SEX ONCE?

09:51.161 --> 09:53.694
I MISS YOU. I WANNA
SPEND TIME WITH YOU.

09:53.694 --> 09:56.697
NOW MOVE THE CREAMED CORN
AND DO ME!
 OKAY, HOW ABOUT
TOMORROW NIGHT?

09:56.697 --> 09:58.699
YEAH,
I'VE HEARD THAT BEFORE,

09:58.699 --> 10:01.201
AND THEN TOMORROW COMES,
AND YOU'RE TOO TIRED.

10:01.201 --> 10:03.704
OKAY, THEN, THIS WEEKEND.
I'LL BE ALL YOURS.

10:03.704 --> 10:06.707
AND WE CAN DEFILE ANY PIECE
OF FURNITURE YOU WANT.

10:10.280 --> 10:14.144
HEY, KAREN, YOU DON'T HAVE
ANY FAX PAPER, DO YOU?

10:14.144 --> 10:15.886
(loudly) FAX PAPER!

10:15.886 --> 10:19.049
TURN DOWN THE DEAN MARTIN!

10:19.049 --> 10:21.051
(normal voice)
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

10:21.051 --> 10:24.194
I'LL GO TO THE STORE TOMORROW.
DO YOU NEED ANYTHING?

10:24.194 --> 10:27.658
EGGS... MILK...

10:27.658 --> 10:29.159
LIGHTBULBS...

10:29.159 --> 10:31.161
(sets down pen)
 OKAY, LET'S MAKE THIS EASIER.

10:31.161 --> 10:33.163
IS THERE ANYTHING
YOU DON'T NEED?

10:33.163 --> 10:34.835
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT.

10:34.835 --> 10:37.838
I'LL CALL YOU FROM THE STORE
IN THE MORNING, OKAY?
 (beep)

10:53.223 --> 10:56.226
WHAT A LOVELY RAINBOW, JUNE.

10:56.226 --> 10:59.089
HERE'S A GOLD STAR FOR YOU.

10:59.089 --> 11:01.862
OH, DREW, WOW!

11:01.862 --> 11:04.935
YOU KNOW,
ELEPHANTS DON'T HAVE WINGS,

11:04.935 --> 11:08.699
BUT I LIKE THE WAY
YOU'RE THINKING. (chuckles)

11:08.699 --> 11:11.171
HEY, EVAN,
WHAT DID YOU DRAW?

11:12.903 --> 11:14.805
OH.

11:14.805 --> 11:17.908
UM...
THAT'S A LOT OF RED.

11:17.908 --> 11:20.010
IT'S BLOOD.

11:20.010 --> 11:22.883
OKAY.

11:22.883 --> 11:24.785
SO...

11:24.785 --> 11:28.058
THAT MAN MUST BE A DOCTOR

11:28.058 --> 11:31.321
MAKING THE BLOODY MAN
ALL BETTER?

11:31.321 --> 11:34.925
NO, HE'S STABBING HIM
IN THE GUTS WITH A SWORD.

11:34.925 --> 11:37.968
EVAN, THAT'S...

11:37.968 --> 11:39.970
KIND OF A SCARY PICTURE.

11:39.970 --> 11:41.431
NUH-UNH, IT'S FUNNY.

11:41.431 --> 11:44.074
NO, HONEY,
IT'S INAPPROPRIATE,

11:44.074 --> 11:46.076
ESPECIALLY WHEN
THE ASSIGNMENT WAS

11:46.076 --> 11:48.338
TO MAKE A PICTURE
THAT MAKES YOU HAPPY.

11:48.338 --> 11:51.041
THIS DOES MAKE ME HAPPY.

11:51.041 --> 11:52.883
WHERE'S MY GOLD STAR?

11:56.416 --> 11:58.819
I JUST CAN'T GET USED
TO EVERYONE WORKING--

11:58.819 --> 12:01.491
FIRST BREE, THEN SUSAN,
NOW LYNETTE.

12:01.491 --> 12:03.323
THANK GOD FOR YOU.

12:03.323 --> 12:06.126
(chuckles)
 I JUST HAD TO GET OUT
OF THAT BORING HOUSE.

12:06.126 --> 12:09.129
SO WHAT DO YOU GALS DO
WHEN YOU GET TOGETHER?
 MOSTLY GOSSIP.

12:09.129 --> 12:12.202
MM.
 YOU GOT ANY GOOD GOSSIP?

12:12.202 --> 12:15.806
OOH. I HEARD ED SIMMONS
GOT A HARLEY.

12:17.507 --> 12:19.509
YOU KNOW, I SHOULD GET BACK.

12:19.509 --> 12:23.213
COME ON. GIVE ME A BREAK.
(laughs) I'M STILL NEW AT THIS.
 (sighs) OKAY.

12:23.213 --> 12:26.146
WE'LL START WITH SOMETHING
A LITTLE EASIER--BITCHING.

12:26.146 --> 12:28.518
I CAN HANDLE THAT.
BITCH AWAY.

12:28.518 --> 12:32.352
WELL, I AM SO PISSED AT CARLOS.
HE IS NEVER HOME.

12:32.352 --> 12:35.355
AND WHEN HE IS, HE'S TOO TIRED
TO DO ANYTHING.

12:35.355 --> 12:38.228
AND BY "ANYTHING,"
I MEAN SEX.

12:39.790 --> 12:41.131
ARE YOU UNCOMFORTABLE?

12:41.131 --> 12:43.333
A LITTLE. GO ON.

12:43.333 --> 12:46.196
WELL, WE'VE NEVER HAD
A DROUGHT LIKE THIS.

12:46.196 --> 12:48.198
IT'S BEEN ALMOST TWO WEEKS.

12:48.198 --> 12:51.071
TWO WEEKS? AND THAT'S
A DROUGHT FOR YOU?

12:51.071 --> 12:53.844
YEAH. LATELY, CARLOS JUST
DOESN'T WANT TO DO IT.

12:53.844 --> 12:56.176
(imitates buzzer) WRONG.
GUYS ALWAYS WANNA DO IT.

12:56.176 --> 12:57.808
REALLY?
 YEAH.

12:57.808 --> 13:01.051
EVEN IF YOU'RE TIRED
AND GET HOME LATE?

13:01.051 --> 13:03.053
EVEN IF WE'RE EXHAUSTED
AND LATE

13:03.053 --> 13:05.085
AND BEEN SHOT IN THE LEG...
TWICE.

13:05.085 --> 13:06.957
WE STILL WANT TO.

13:06.957 --> 13:10.190
SO YOU JUST GOTTA GET PAST
THE TIRED ADULT TO FIND

13:10.190 --> 13:12.192
THE HORNY TEENAGE BOY INSIDE.

13:12.192 --> 13:14.925
HUH. THAT'S GOOD TO KNOW.

13:14.925 --> 13:17.267
YOU'RE GOOD
AT THIS GIRL TALK THING.

13:17.267 --> 13:19.129
WELL, THANKS. (chuckles)

13:19.129 --> 13:22.502
SO, UM, DOES LYNETTE EVER
TALK ABOUT ME AND SEX?

13:24.334 --> 13:26.336
YEAH, I SHOULD GET BACK.

13:29.109 --> 13:32.082
(laughs) YOU CALLED ME
DOWN HERE FOR THIS?

13:32.082 --> 13:34.184
IT'S A KID PLAYING
WITH A SOCCER BALL.

13:34.184 --> 13:37.888
IT'S A HEAD, AND HE'S STABBING
SOMEONE WITH A SWORD.

13:37.888 --> 13:40.120
WELL, MAYBE IT WAS
IN SELF-DEFENSE.

13:40.120 --> 13:44.224
MR. MAYER, GENERALLY, WHEN KIDS
EXHIBIT THIS TYPE OF BEHAVIOR,

13:44.224 --> 13:46.096
THERE'S A PROBLEM.

13:46.096 --> 13:48.828
(cell phone rings)
 EXCUSE ME.

13:48.828 --> 13:50.830
I HAVE TO TAKE THIS. SORRY.
 (ring)

13:50.830 --> 13:53.263
(beep)
 HELLO?

13:53.263 --> 13:57.267
THANKS FOR RATTING OUT MY KID
ON HIS FIRST DAY.

13:57.267 --> 14:00.270
IT'S NOT MY FAULT. I SHOWED THIS
TO THE SCHOOL PSYCHOLOGIST.

14:00.270 --> 14:03.843
SHE GAVE IT TO THE PRINCIPAL.
MY HANDS WERE TIED.
 SO RIGHT AWAY
IT'S EVAN'S FAULT?

14:03.843 --> 14:05.145
DID YOU EVER CONSIDER

14:05.145 --> 14:07.317
THAT HE DIDN'T UNDERSTAND
THE ASSIGNMENT?

14:07.317 --> 14:10.020
I TOLD THE CLASS TO DRAW
SOMETHING THAT MADE THEM HAPPY.

14:10.020 --> 14:12.022
ALL THE OTHER KIDS
DREW KITTENS AND RAINBOWS.

14:12.022 --> 14:15.255
YOUR SON DREW SMALL INTESTINES
ON THE END OF A STICK.

14:15.255 --> 14:17.627
LET'S CUT TO WHAT
THIS IS REALLY ABOUT.

14:17.627 --> 14:21.161
YOU HATE ME, AND YOU DON'T
WANT MY SON IN YOUR CLASS.

14:21.161 --> 14:23.633
THAT IS NOT TRUE!
 IT IS, TOO!

14:23.633 --> 14:25.635
YOU'RE STILL PUNISHING ME
FOR WHAT HAPPENED BETWEEN US.

14:25.635 --> 14:27.637
YOU'RE STUCK IN THE PAST

14:27.637 --> 14:30.640
AND BLAMING ME
FOR YOUR SCREWED-UP LIFE!
 OKAY, WILL SOMEONE
CALL GUINNESS?

14:30.640 --> 14:33.303
BECAUSE YOU JUST SET
THE WORLD RECORD

14:33.303 --> 14:37.307
FOR THE BIGGEST LOAD OF CRAP
IN ONE SENTENCE.
 OH, BITE ME!

14:37.307 --> 14:39.379
HOW LONG WAS I GONE?

14:39.379 --> 14:41.351
UH...

14:41.351 --> 14:43.353
THIS IS NOTHING, MR. HOBSON.

14:43.353 --> 14:46.886
WE WERE JUST HAVING
A DIFFERENCE OF OPINION.

14:46.886 --> 14:49.119
YEAH, AND MY OPINION IS

14:49.119 --> 14:51.521
YOUR TEACHER DOESN'T UNDERSTAND
THE DIFFERENCE

14:51.521 --> 14:54.464
BETWEEN EMOTIONAL PROBLEMS
AND CREATIVITY.
 (lowered voice) SHUT UP, KARL.

14:54.464 --> 14:56.896
EXCUSE ME. DID YOU JUST
TELL HIM TO SHUT UP?

14:56.896 --> 15:00.330
YOU KNOW, THIS IS
TYPICAL "SUSAN" BEHAVIOR.

15:00.330 --> 15:03.273
AND YOU WONDER WHY
NO MAN CAN STAY WITH YOU.

15:06.176 --> 15:08.008
(spits)

15:10.310 --> 15:12.312
WOULD THIS SEEM
ANY LESS SHOCKING

15:12.312 --> 15:15.215
IF I TOLD YOU WE WERE
ONCE MARRIED FOR 12 YEARS?

15:19.389 --> 15:23.223
YES,
AM I SPEAKING TO MR. DINSMORE?

15:23.223 --> 15:26.226
AH, THIS IS BREE VAN DE KAMP.

15:26.226 --> 15:29.159
YES,
IT'S NICE TO TALK TO YOU, TOO.

15:29.159 --> 15:31.161
WELL, AS I'M SURE YOU'RE AWARE,

15:31.161 --> 15:35.435
YOUR COMPANY HAS MADE
SEVERAL OFFERS TO PURCHASE MINE.

15:35.435 --> 15:38.138
YES, I KNOW I SAID
I WASN'T INTERESTED,

15:38.138 --> 15:40.440
BUT SOME THINGS HAVE HAPPENED
IN MY PERSONAL LIFE

15:40.440 --> 15:43.413
AND I THINK I'M READY TO...

15:43.413 --> 15:46.977
FINALLY MAKE A DEAL.

15:46.977 --> 15:48.548
REALLY?

15:48.548 --> 15:50.520
WELL, THAT'S WONDERFUL.

15:50.520 --> 15:52.222
WHY DON'T YOU, UH,

15:52.222 --> 15:56.186
COME TO MY OFFICE TOMORROW
AND WE'LL TALK?

15:56.186 --> 15:58.028
GOOD-BYE, MR. DINSMORE.

16:11.401 --> 16:13.443
THERE YOU GO.
THE REST IS YOURS.

16:13.443 --> 16:15.445
THANKS.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS.

16:15.445 --> 16:18.608
EVERY TIME I GO TO THE MARKET,
THERE'S STUFF I FORGET.

16:18.608 --> 16:21.311
I KNOW WHAT IT IS.
YOU'RE OLD.

16:21.311 --> 16:23.383
(chuckles)

16:23.383 --> 16:26.316
SO WHERE'S DAVE?
 CAMPING.

16:26.316 --> 16:28.288
OOH, CAMPING. HOW FUN.

16:28.288 --> 16:29.759
ENJOYING THE GREAT OUTDOORS,

16:29.759 --> 16:32.262
GETTING A BUNCH OF TEENAGE KIDS
ON PROM WEEKEND.

16:32.262 --> 16:34.324
GOOD FOR HIM.

16:34.324 --> 16:36.596
LOOK, I KNOW THAT YOU THINK
HE'S SOME CREEPY PSYCHO.

16:36.596 --> 16:41.231
BUT YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT
HE HAS HAD A VERY HARD LIFE,

16:41.231 --> 16:44.204
AND THERE ARE THINGS ABOUT HIM
THAT YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

16:44.204 --> 16:45.275
LIKE WHAT?

16:45.275 --> 16:47.277
LIKE HE WAS MARRIED BEFORE,

16:47.277 --> 16:49.279
AND HIS WIFE DIED
IN AN ACCIDENT

16:49.279 --> 16:51.511
ALONG WITH
THEIR 3-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER.

16:51.511 --> 16:54.214
OH, EDIE. ARE YOU SURE?

16:54.214 --> 16:57.047
YES.

16:57.047 --> 16:59.219
SO IF AT TIMES

16:59.219 --> 17:03.323
HIS BEHAVIOR SEEMS
A LITTLE STRANGE,

17:03.323 --> 17:06.256
TRY TO REMEMBER THE GRIEF
HE'S CARRYING.

17:08.298 --> 17:11.101
YOU KNOW, I LOST A KID.

17:11.101 --> 17:13.663
IT DOES THINGS TO YOU.

17:13.663 --> 17:16.136
NO WONDER HE...

17:16.136 --> 17:18.137
OH, GOD, I WISH I'D KNOWN.

17:18.137 --> 17:20.140
WELL, YOU DO NOW.

17:20.140 --> 17:23.113
SO NEXT TIME, TRY TO BE
A LITTLE MORE UNDERSTANDING.

17:23.113 --> 17:25.075
OF COURSE.

17:25.075 --> 17:28.078
YOU KNOW,
I COULD USE A DRINK.

17:28.078 --> 17:31.181
COME TO MY HOUSE AND WE'LL
CRANK UP DEAN MARTIN AND...

17:31.181 --> 17:33.052
TOSS A FEW BACK.

17:33.052 --> 17:34.354
(clicks tongue) COME ON.

17:40.190 --> 17:41.691
(beeps)

18:10.860 --> 18:13.363
MOM?

18:15.125 --> 18:18.298
OH, ANDREW.
I DIDN'T HEAR YOU COME IN.

18:18.298 --> 18:21.171
THAT DINSMORE GUY
IS WAITING FOR YOU DOWNSTAIRS.

18:21.171 --> 18:23.373
THANK YOU, DEAR.

18:26.476 --> 18:29.479
I MUST SAY, BREE. I WAS
SURPRISED TO GET YOUR CALL.

18:29.479 --> 18:31.841
YOU'VE ALWAYS SAID
YOU'D NEVER SELL YOUR COMPANY.

18:31.841 --> 18:35.345
BREE HAS DECIDED
SHE WANTS MORE FAMILY TIME.

18:35.345 --> 18:37.387
SHE'S A VERY TRADITIONAL WOMAN,
YOU KNOW.

18:37.387 --> 18:40.390
IT'S ONE OF THE REASONS
I FELL IN LOVE WITH HER.

18:40.390 --> 18:43.223
DOES THAT MEAN YOU'RE GOING
TO STOP WORKING ALTOGETHER?

18:43.223 --> 18:46.226
I KNOW YOUR FANS HAVE BEEN
HOPING FOR A SECOND BOOK,

18:46.226 --> 18:48.358
UH, MY WIFE INCLUDED.
(chuckles)

18:48.358 --> 18:50.360
(sighs) THAT'S SWEET,
BUT I'VE DECIDED TO FOCUS

18:50.360 --> 18:52.362
ON OTHER PURSUITS
AT THE MOMENT.

18:52.362 --> 18:55.365
MM, YES, HER SOLE AMBITION NOW
IS TO BE MRS. ORSON HODGE.

18:55.365 --> 18:57.367
AND AT THE RISK
OF SOUNDING SELFISH,

18:57.367 --> 19:00.640
I'M GLAD I'LL BE THE ONLY ONE
SHE'S COOKING FOR. (chuckles)

19:00.640 --> 19:03.743
WERE YOU ABLE TO LOOK OVER
THE CONTRACTS I SENT OVER?
 OH, SHOOT.

19:03.743 --> 19:07.317
I LEFT THEM UPSTAIRS.
 OH. WELL, I'LL GET THEM.

19:07.317 --> 19:09.849
I'LL SHOW YOU THE OFFICES
BEFORE WE START THE DEMOLITION.

19:09.849 --> 19:12.252
YOU'RE GETTING RID
OF YOUR OFFICE?

19:12.252 --> 19:14.254
NO, WE DON'T NEED IT ANYMORE,

19:14.254 --> 19:18.388
AND BREE KNOWS I'VE ALWAYS
WANTED A GAME ROOM.

19:18.388 --> 19:21.791
SO IT'S YOUR "SOLE AMBITION"
TO BE MRS. ORSON HODGE?

19:21.791 --> 19:23.333
ANDREW.

19:23.333 --> 19:25.265
NO, I-I HAVE TO ASK.

19:25.265 --> 19:27.767
WHY ARE YOU LETTING ORSON
SELL YOUR COMPANY?

19:27.767 --> 19:29.439
IT WAS MY IDEA.

19:29.439 --> 19:32.542
MY WORK HAS BEEN
COMPROMISING MY MARRIAGE.

19:32.542 --> 19:35.575
I DIDN'T REALIZE THE TOLL
IT'S BEEN TAKING ON ORSON.

19:35.575 --> 19:39.549
OKAY, SO HE'S UNHAPPY.

19:39.549 --> 19:41.551
BUY HIM SOME GOLF CLUBS,
PUT HIM ON LITHIUM,

19:41.551 --> 19:44.314
BUT DON'T GIVE UP EVERYTHING
YOU'VE WORKED SO HARD FOR.

19:44.314 --> 19:47.317
ANDREW, DO YOU KNOW WHY
MY BOOK SOLD SO WELL?

19:47.317 --> 19:48.788
BECAUSE IT WAS AUTHENTIC.

19:48.788 --> 19:50.460
I ACTUALLY BELIEVE IN

19:50.460 --> 19:52.462
THE OLD-FASHIONED VALUES
I WROTE ABOUT.

19:52.462 --> 19:54.824
I BELIEVE IN MEN
OPENING DOORS FOR LADIES

19:54.824 --> 19:56.826
AND CHILDREN
RESPECTING THEIR ELDERS.

19:56.826 --> 19:59.829
I ALSO BELIEVE THAT SOMETIMES

19:59.829 --> 20:01.971
WOMEN NEED TO MAKE SACRIFICES
FOR THEIR HUSBANDS.

20:01.971 --> 20:03.973
I WOULD BE
THE WORST KIND OF HYPOCRITE

20:03.973 --> 20:05.975
IF I PREACHED THESE VALUES

20:05.975 --> 20:08.938
AND THEN DIDN'T
FOLLOW THEM MYSELF.

20:08.938 --> 20:10.940
OKAY, I GET IT.
YOU LOVE ORSON,

20:10.940 --> 20:13.413
AND YOU'RE WILLING TO
SELL YOUR COMPANY TO PROVE IT.

20:13.413 --> 20:16.286
WHAT I'M WONDERING IS,
IS IF HE LOVES YOU,

20:16.286 --> 20:19.819
WHY WOULD HE WANT YOU TO STOP
DOING WHAT MAKES YOU HAPPY?

20:23.453 --> 20:26.296
(scoffs)

20:27.827 --> 20:30.300
(door opens and closes)

20:30.300 --> 20:32.562
HEY. YOU BUSY?

20:32.562 --> 20:34.464
WHAT IS IT?

20:34.464 --> 20:37.507
(chuckles) I BROUGHT YOU
A LITTLE GIFT.

20:39.008 --> 20:40.810
OH. CUTE.

20:40.810 --> 20:45.645
I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE A NICE
ADDITION TO YOUR COLLECTION.

20:45.645 --> 20:46.976
UH-HUH.

20:54.424 --> 20:56.286
I KNEW IT WAS YOU.

20:56.286 --> 20:57.557
PARDON?

20:57.557 --> 21:00.560
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO COMPLAINED
ABOUT ME TO CARLOS.

21:00.560 --> 21:02.862
I'M... NOT SURE
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

21:02.862 --> 21:05.565
OH, JEEZ. WHAT,
YOU KNIFE ME IN THE BACK,

21:05.565 --> 21:07.567
AND NOW YOU'RE GONNA
PLAY STUPID?

21:07.567 --> 21:10.340
CARLOS SAID SOME PEOPLE
ARE HAVING PROBLEMS WITH ME

21:10.340 --> 21:12.842
AND THAT I SHOULD
WATCH MY DEMEANOR.

21:12.842 --> 21:16.346
AND I THOUGHT TO MYSELF,
WHO ARE "SOME PEOPLE"?

21:16.346 --> 21:19.579
AND THEN IT HIT ME--
IT'S THE CHUMMY NEIGHBOR.

21:19.579 --> 21:21.581
OKAY, YES, CARLOS AND I
SPOKE BRIEFLY,

21:21.581 --> 21:24.484
BUT I THOUGHT
HE BLEW ME OFF.
 SO THAT'S YOUR DEFENSE?

21:24.484 --> 21:27.457
YOU THOUGHT YOUR BACKSTABBING
WAS UNSUCCESSFUL?

21:27.457 --> 21:29.759
(chuckles) WELL, I'LL ADMIT
IT'S KIND OF FLIMSY,

21:29.759 --> 21:33.423
BUT UNTIL I GOT
SOMETHING BETTER...

21:33.423 --> 21:35.995
OKAY, NEXT TIME YOU HAVE
AN ISSUE WITH ME,

21:35.995 --> 21:37.997
YOU KNOW WHERE MY OFFICE IS.

21:37.997 --> 21:42.402
OH, AND, UH, AS FAR AS
FRIDAY NIGHTS ARE CONCERNED...

21:42.402 --> 21:45.935
CONSIDER THAT
A PERMANENT WORK NIGHT.

21:45.935 --> 21:47.437
DON'T WORRY.

21:47.437 --> 21:50.410
IF YOU'RE AS BAD AT COACHING
AS YOU ARE AT OFFICE POLITICS,

21:50.410 --> 21:52.642
YOUR DAUGHTER
WON'T BE MISSING MUCH.

22:01.320 --> 22:03.322
FOUND THE CONTRACT.

22:03.322 --> 22:04.794
EVERYTHING IS IN ORDER.

22:04.794 --> 22:08.358
ALL WE NEED NOW
IS YOUR SIGNATURE.
 MR. DINSMORE, WOULD YOU MIND

22:08.358 --> 22:10.760
IF I SPEAK TO MY HUSBAND
FOR A MOMENT?

22:10.760 --> 22:15.064
OH, YEAH, PLEASE, GO AHEAD.
I'LL--I'LL BE RIGHT OUTSIDE.

22:15.064 --> 22:16.406
WHAT'S WRONG?

22:16.406 --> 22:19.939
(sighs) THIS IS HAPPENING
SO FAST.

22:19.939 --> 22:23.373
YES, A BIT.
BUT IT WAS YOUR IDEA.

22:23.373 --> 22:25.945
WELL, I HAVE A NEW IDEA.

22:25.945 --> 22:27.617
I'D LIKE TO WAIT.

22:27.617 --> 22:31.881
WAIT? BUT I-I NEED THIS
FOR MY RECOVERY.

22:31.881 --> 22:35.655
JUST GIVE ME ONE YEAR. THAT'S
NOT ASKING TOO MUCH, IS IT?

22:35.655 --> 22:39.529
YOU MADE ME A PROMISE.
YOU NEED TO STICK TO IT.

22:39.529 --> 22:43.563
ORSON, THINK ABOUT HOW I BUILT
THIS COMPANY FROM NOTHING,

22:43.563 --> 22:48.137
HOW IT BRINGS ME JOY AND PRIDE
AND A SENSE OF ACCOMPLISHMENT.

22:48.137 --> 22:51.801
IS THAT REALLY SOMETHING
YOU WANT ME TO GIVE UP?

22:51.801 --> 22:54.944
YES.

23:01.481 --> 23:03.953
MR. DINSMORE, WOULD YOU
COME BACK IN, PLEASE?

23:06.886 --> 23:08.888
SO ARE WE READY?

23:11.921 --> 23:14.464
ACTUALLY, NO.

23:14.464 --> 23:16.065
I'M NOT SELLING.

23:16.065 --> 23:17.567
EXCUSE ME?

23:17.567 --> 23:19.168
TELL YOUR WIFE

23:19.168 --> 23:21.701
I WILL BE DOING
THAT SECOND BOOK AFTER ALL.

23:23.172 --> 23:25.174
WELL, I'M--I'M SORRY
TO HEAR THAT.

23:27.677 --> 23:29.579
(lowered voice) BREE...

23:29.579 --> 23:31.441
WHAT ABOUT MY PROBLEM?

23:31.441 --> 23:33.443
I MIGHT START STEALING
AGAIN.

23:33.443 --> 23:36.886
STEAL WHAT YOU MUST,
MY LOVE.

23:36.886 --> 23:39.489
BUT IT WON'T BE MY COMPANY.

23:55.064 --> 23:56.766
(laughs ) LOOK AT HIM.

23:56.766 --> 23:58.638
HE'S OUT LIKE A LIGHT
ALREADY.

23:58.638 --> 24:01.811
THAT'S WHAT A LONG DAY
OF FISHING DOES TO YOU.

24:01.811 --> 24:04.073
YEAH, WELL, HE'S GONNA NEED
ALL OF HIS ENERGY

24:04.073 --> 24:06.075
FOR OUR BIG HIKE TOMORROW,
RIGHT?

24:06.075 --> 24:08.648
ACTUALLY, I DON'T THINK
I'M GONNA GO WITH YOU GUYS.

24:08.648 --> 24:10.680
MY KNEE'S BEEN
KIND OF BOTHERING ME.

24:10.680 --> 24:13.122
OKAY, WELL, THEN WHY DON'T WE
WAIT TILL THE NEXT DAY

24:13.122 --> 24:15.124
AND SEE HOW YOU FEEL?

24:15.124 --> 24:18.127
NO, NO, IT'S FINE.
I'M JUST GONNA HANG OUT HERE.

24:18.127 --> 24:20.129
BESIDES,
IT'S SUCH A ROMANTIC HIKE.

24:20.129 --> 24:22.862
YOU GUYS SHOULD DO IT ALONE.

24:22.862 --> 24:25.965
YOU ALWAYS HAVE
SUCH A GOOD ATTITUDE.

24:25.965 --> 24:27.967
DO I?
 UH-HUH.

24:27.967 --> 24:32.001
IT SEEMS LIKE YOU TAKE
EVERYTHING IN STRIDE, YOU KNOW?

24:32.001 --> 24:35.204
LIKE YOU JUST NATURALLY FIND
THE SILVER LINING.

24:35.204 --> 24:38.177
YEAH, I WISH
IT WERE NATURAL.

24:38.177 --> 24:40.880
I HAD TO TEACH MYSELF
TO BE THIS WAY.

24:40.880 --> 24:43.182
WITH SOME OF THE STUFF
THAT'S HAPPENED TO ME,

24:43.182 --> 24:45.885
I NEVER WOULD'VE SURVIVED
IF I HADN'T.

24:48.157 --> 24:50.159
SO WHAT'S YOUR SECRET?

24:50.159 --> 24:53.593
OH, I REALIZED THAT...

24:53.593 --> 24:58.497
I WAS WAITING FOR SOMEBODY
TO FIX THINGS.

24:58.497 --> 25:02.101
BUT NO ONE WAS GOING TO.

25:02.101 --> 25:04.103
IT WAS ALL UP TO ME.

25:07.036 --> 25:09.909
I HAD TO DECIDE
WHAT WAS IMPORTANT

25:09.909 --> 25:12.782
AND GO AFTER IT.

25:12.782 --> 25:15.545
I HAD TO MAKE MYSELF HAPPY.

25:15.545 --> 25:18.788
(whispers) ARE YOU?

25:18.788 --> 25:21.250
(normal voice) HAPPY.

25:21.250 --> 25:23.522
I'M GETTIN' THERE.

25:25.595 --> 25:28.197
WHY DON'T YOU GET SOME SLEEP?

25:28.197 --> 25:30.199
YOU GOT A BIG DAY TOMORROW.

25:50.019 --> 25:52.952
COME ON, LUCY. WHY WOULD YOU
AGREE TO THIS MEETING?

25:52.952 --> 25:55.184
WELL, WE'RE OVEREXTENDED
AS IT IS.

25:55.184 --> 25:56.656
(scoffs)

25:56.656 --> 25:57.987
FINE.

25:57.987 --> 26:01.060
YEAH, I'LL SEE YOU AT
THE CONFERENCE ROOM AT 7:00 A.M.

26:01.060 --> 26:03.062
HI THERE.

26:03.062 --> 26:04.834
HEY, BABE.

26:04.834 --> 26:07.667
WHAT ARE YOU DOING UP?

26:07.667 --> 26:11.340
I COULDN'T SLEEP.
I WAS A LITTLE HOT.

26:14.343 --> 26:16.706
(whispers) THAT'S BETTER.

26:16.706 --> 26:18.848
(normal voice) YOU LOOK
A LITTLE WARM YOURSELF.

26:18.848 --> 26:22.712
OKAY, I KNOW WHERE
YOU'RE GOING WITH THIS.
 OH, IF THAT WERE TRUE,

26:22.712 --> 26:27.256
YOUR PANTS WOULD BE
AROUND YOUR ANKLES RIGHT NOW.
 (sighs) GABY,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

26:27.256 --> 26:30.319
I'M RELEASING THE HORNY TEEN
INSIDE OF YOU.
 (grunts)

26:30.319 --> 26:33.092
NOW COME ON.
TWO BOOBS, NO WAITING.
 DAMN IT, GABY,

26:33.092 --> 26:37.296
I THOUGHT WE WERE GONNA WAIT
TILL THE WEEKEND. I'M TIRED.
 (sighs) NOT MY PROBLEM.

26:37.296 --> 26:38.798
(scoffs)

26:38.798 --> 26:41.801
ACTUALLY, IT IS! YOU KNOW,
IF BIG CARLOS IS TIRED,

26:41.801 --> 26:44.333
THAT PRETTY MUCH RULES OUT
LITTLE CARLOS, TOO.

26:44.333 --> 26:46.335
NOW LISTEN UP,
THE PAIR OF YOU.

26:46.335 --> 26:49.338
I HAVEN'T BEEN SITTING AROUND
IN BUTT FLOSS ALL NIGHT

26:49.338 --> 26:52.141
FOR MY HEALTH.
YOU'RE PUTTING OUT.

26:52.141 --> 26:53.282
(grunts)

26:53.282 --> 26:56.285
(kissing)

26:56.285 --> 26:57.817
OH! AHH!

26:57.817 --> 26:59.649
THAT'S MORE LIKE IT!

26:59.649 --> 27:01.891
WELL, I'M AWAKE NOW.

27:01.891 --> 27:03.993
IN FACT...

27:03.993 --> 27:07.296
MIND IF WE SPICE IT UP
A BIT?

27:07.296 --> 27:09.198
(squeals and laughs)

27:09.198 --> 27:12.031
I FORGOT THESE WERE
IN THE NIGHTSTAND.

27:12.031 --> 27:14.033
THIS IS GONNA BE FUN.

27:14.033 --> 27:15.334
MM-HMM. THERE. HOW'S THAT?

27:15.334 --> 27:19.238
TIGHT, JUST THE WAY
I LIKE IT.
 (chuckles) ME, TOO.

27:19.238 --> 27:22.271
MMM.

27:22.271 --> 27:23.412
GOOD NIGHT.

27:23.412 --> 27:25.845
CARLOS, WHERE YOU GOING?

27:25.845 --> 27:27.847
TO GO GRAB A FEW HOURS SLEEP

27:27.847 --> 27:30.319
BEFORE I HAVE TO GET BACK
TO WORK.

27:30.319 --> 27:33.252
CARLOS, GET BACK HERE!
CARLOS!
 (door opens)

27:33.252 --> 27:34.253
(grunts)

27:34.253 --> 27:37.426
COULD YOU AT LEAST
SCRATCH MY NOSE?!

27:37.426 --> 27:41.360
AMY, THAT IS VERY SWEET.

27:41.360 --> 27:44.033
I LOVE
THE COLORS YOU USED.

27:44.033 --> 27:48.037
OH, DANIELLE,
THAT IS JUST BEAUTIFUL.

27:48.037 --> 27:50.299
HMM.

28:06.716 --> 28:07.757
OH.

28:07.757 --> 28:10.820
EVAN, THAT IS VERY PRETTY.

28:10.820 --> 28:14.263
YOU DID THE ASSIGNMENT
JUST LIKE I ASKED. GOOD JOB!

28:14.263 --> 28:15.765
THAT'S NOT MINE.

28:15.765 --> 28:18.267
ANNIE ASKED ME
TO BRING HERS UP FOR HER.

28:18.267 --> 28:19.869
THIS ONE'S MINE.

28:19.869 --> 28:21.731
(gasps)

28:30.379 --> 28:32.111
(beeps)

28:39.248 --> 28:40.950
(bangs table)

28:40.950 --> 28:43.252
(whispers) SHH! SHH! SHH!
 (laughs softly) OH!

28:43.252 --> 28:44.954
DON'T WAKE HIM UP.

28:44.954 --> 28:47.797
(whispers) I KNOW. OW!
 COME ON.

28:58.237 --> 29:01.170
(grunts)

29:08.517 --> 29:12.321
(grunting and panting)

29:14.353 --> 29:16.025
(whirs)

29:20.329 --> 29:23.192
(grunts)

29:23.192 --> 29:25.064
(speaking indistinctly)

29:30.399 --> 29:31.370
(Mike) I KNOW.

29:31.370 --> 29:34.303
(sighs)
 (Mike speaking indistinctly)

29:36.976 --> 29:38.777
(cell phone rings)

29:38.777 --> 29:40.880
(bullet ricochets)
 (gasps)

29:40.880 --> 29:42.251
(grunts)
 (ring, beep)

29:42.251 --> 29:45.414
WHAT IS THAT?
 LET'S JUST GO BACK.
LET'S GO BACK.

29:51.520 --> 29:53.192
(Mike speaks indistinctly)

29:55.865 --> 29:58.497
I HEARD A GUNSHOT. IT SOUNDED
LIKE A HUNTING RIFLE.

29:58.497 --> 30:01.400
YEAH, IT ALMOST HIT KATHERINE.
 YOU GUYS ALL RIGHT?

30:01.400 --> 30:03.372
YEAH, I THINK SO.
 HEY, THIS IS A STATE PARK.

30:03.372 --> 30:06.575
PEOPLE AREN'T SUPPOSED
TO BE HUNTING HERE.
 WELL, I GUESS THESE GUYS
DON'T CARE ABOUT THAT.

30:06.575 --> 30:09.939
I JUST WANNA
GET OUT OF HERE. PLEASE?
 YEAH, OF COURSE.

30:09.939 --> 30:12.541
WE'LL, UH, GO BACK AND PACK,
AND WE'LL LEAVE.

30:12.541 --> 30:14.243
WELL, SORRY, MAN.

30:16.085 --> 30:18.247
ME, TOO.

30:40.970 --> 30:43.372
JUANITA! CELIA!
GET YOUR COATS ON!

30:43.372 --> 30:45.374
WE'RE GOING TO SEE DADDY.

30:47.316 --> 30:50.379
LET ME SEE IT.
 OKAY, JUST SO YOU KNOW,

30:50.379 --> 30:52.421
I SHOULD BE BRINGING THIS
TO THE PSYCHOLOGIST.

30:52.421 --> 30:55.284
BUT I DIDN'T, BECAUSE THIS KIND
OF "SELF-EXPRESSION"

30:55.284 --> 30:58.287
USUALLY GETS A KID EXPELLED.
 JUST LET ME SEE IT.

31:00.859 --> 31:03.162
AW, HELL.

31:03.162 --> 31:04.633
YEAH, "AW, HELL."

31:04.633 --> 31:06.635
YOU GOT A PROBLEM HERE,
KARL.

31:06.635 --> 31:09.368
YOUR SON'S GOT
SOME SERIOUS ANGER ISSUES,

31:09.368 --> 31:12.071
AND YOU NEED TO FIGURE OUT
WHAT'S GOING ON.

31:12.071 --> 31:15.474
I KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON.
THIS IS HIS MOM.

31:15.474 --> 31:17.176
MARISA?

31:17.176 --> 31:19.979
WELL, WHY WOULD HE DRAW
A PICTURE OF HER LIKE THIS?

31:26.285 --> 31:29.258
SHE LEFT US...
SIX WEEKS AGO.

31:29.258 --> 31:31.360
OH.

31:31.360 --> 31:32.922
KARL...

31:32.922 --> 31:34.924
I WOKE UP ONE DAY

31:34.924 --> 31:37.296
TO FIND HER STANDING THERE
WITH HER BAGS PACKED.

31:37.296 --> 31:40.169
SHE SAID
SHE WAS OVERWHELMED,

31:40.169 --> 31:41.630
THAT SHE LOVED EVAN

31:41.630 --> 31:44.573
BUT SHE WASN'T CUT OUT
TO BE A MOTHER.

31:46.575 --> 31:49.238
SO SHE JUST LEFT?

31:50.609 --> 31:52.641
SO HERE I AM, ALONE,

31:52.641 --> 31:55.014
RAISING THIS BOY.

31:57.086 --> 32:00.089
AND IT'S OBVIOUS I'M NOT
DOING A VERY GOOD JOB.

32:02.621 --> 32:05.324
(exhales deeply)

32:05.324 --> 32:07.556
YOU MUST BE LOVING THIS.

32:07.556 --> 32:10.099
WHY?

32:10.099 --> 32:14.003
'CAUSE I DID
THE EXACT SAME THING TO YOU.

32:14.003 --> 32:16.365
OH.

32:16.365 --> 32:19.138
YEAH.

32:19.138 --> 32:22.371
YOU KNOW, I CAN UNDERSTAND
WHY YOU REACT THE WAY YOU DO

32:22.371 --> 32:24.473
WHEN YOU BUMP INTO ME,

32:24.473 --> 32:26.345
WHY IT BOTHERS YOU.

32:29.018 --> 32:33.522
I NEVER REALLY GOT IT
UNTIL JUST NOW.

32:37.356 --> 32:40.289
I USED TO HOPE
THAT ONE DAY,

32:40.289 --> 32:42.591
YOU WOULD KNOW
WHAT THIS FELT LIKE,

32:42.591 --> 32:45.434
AND NOW THAT YOU DO...

32:45.434 --> 32:49.068
I'M SO SORRY.

32:55.704 --> 32:58.107
OH! HEY, LYNETTE!
 HI!

32:58.107 --> 33:00.449
GREAT OFFICE. I SEE YOU'RE BUSY.
DON'T LET ME DISTURB YOU.

33:00.449 --> 33:02.511
I JUST WANTED
TO DROP OFF THE GIRLS

33:02.511 --> 33:04.613
SO I COULD TALK TO CARLOS
FOR A SEC.

33:04.613 --> 33:07.316
ALL RIGHT, GIRLS,
HAVE FUN WITH AUNT LYNETTE.

33:13.162 --> 33:16.495
YOU THINK YOU CAN
BUY ME OFF WITH PRESENTS?
 GABY, NOW IS NOT A GOOD TIME.

33:16.495 --> 33:18.497
WELL, I'D SAY
LET'S TALK ABOUT IT TONIGHT,

33:18.497 --> 33:21.200
BUT WHO KNOWS IF YOU'RE
EVEN GONNA COME HOME?

33:21.200 --> 33:22.701
(sighs) DAMN IT, GABY.

33:22.701 --> 33:25.174
YOU'RE THE ONE THAT PUSHED ME
TO TAKE THIS JOB.

33:25.174 --> 33:27.176
AND EVER SINCE I DID,

33:27.176 --> 33:30.179
ALL YOU'VE DONE IS COMPLAIN
ABOUT HOW HARD I'M WORKING.

33:30.179 --> 33:32.541
YOU'RE RIGHT, AND I'M SORRY.
IT'S JUST... I'M SCARED.

33:32.541 --> 33:34.543
WE'RE TURNING INTO
WHAT WE USED TO BE.

33:34.543 --> 33:37.346
(voice breaks)
I'M UNHAPPY AT HOME,

33:37.346 --> 33:40.149
YOU'RE ALWAYS WORKING, TRYING TO
BUY ME OFF WITH PRESENTS,

33:40.149 --> 33:42.421
TOO TIRED
TO MAKE ME FEEL LOVED.

33:42.421 --> 33:45.054
WE'VE MADE THESE MISTAKES
BEFORE, CARLOS.

33:45.054 --> 33:47.796
FOR GOD SAKES,
LET'S NOT MAKE 'EM AGAIN.

33:47.796 --> 33:50.799
(sighs) I MADE
A COMMITMENT HERE, GABY.

33:50.799 --> 33:54.533
I DON'T THINK
I CAN JUST BAIL.

33:54.533 --> 33:56.365
I KNOW YOU CAN'T,

33:56.365 --> 33:59.408
AND THAT'S THE PART
THAT REALLY SCARES ME.

34:01.640 --> 34:03.642
WE'RE BORED.

34:03.642 --> 34:05.644
HEY, I GOT YOU SODAS,
DIDN'T I?

34:05.644 --> 34:07.746
AND I LET YOU FEED
THE PAPER SHREDDER.

34:07.746 --> 34:10.748
DON'T YOU HAVE ANY TOYS?
 NO. I GOT A HOLE PUNCHER.

34:10.748 --> 34:13.452
SORRY. THAT'S THE BEST
I COULD DO. COME ON.

34:16.284 --> 34:19.588
WHAT ABOUT
THOSE GLASS THINGS?

34:19.588 --> 34:21.590
THEY'RE PRETTY.
CAN I HOLD ONE?

34:21.590 --> 34:24.293
OH, SWEETIE,
THOSE AREN'T TO PLAY WITH,

34:24.293 --> 34:27.436
NOT UNLESS YOU WANNA SEE SOMEONE
GO COMPLETELY BONKERS.

34:29.638 --> 34:34.072
ACTUALLY, THEY DO LOOK
LIKE A LOT OF FUN.

34:34.072 --> 34:36.505
IF ONLY I HAD THE POWER
TO STOP YOU...

34:43.652 --> 34:46.585
WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING?!

34:46.585 --> 34:49.487
WE'RE PLAYING.
WHAT DOES IT LOOK LIKE?

34:49.487 --> 34:50.819
(sighs)

34:54.663 --> 34:56.665
ARE THESE YOUR KIDS?

34:56.665 --> 34:59.298
'CAUSE THEY WERE IN MY OFFICE
PLAYING WITH MY FIGURINES,

34:59.298 --> 35:03.232
WHICH ARE IMPORTED.
THEY'RE WORTH A LOT OF DINERO.

35:03.232 --> 35:05.234
(Lucy) DO YOU EVEN UNDERSTAND
WHAT I'M SAYING?!

35:05.234 --> 35:08.237
WHAT'S WITH THE YELLING?
 I DON'T KNOW. I'M JUST
AS WORRIED AS YOU ARE.

35:08.237 --> 35:10.539
LOOK, LET ME
BOIL IT DOWN FOR YOU.

35:10.539 --> 35:11.880
OFFICE? Sí.

35:11.880 --> 35:13.712
DAY CARE? NO!

35:13.712 --> 35:15.514
LUCY, WHAT'S GOING ON?

35:15.514 --> 35:17.516
APPARENTLY, SOME PEOPLE
DON'T UNDERSTAND

35:17.516 --> 35:19.518
THAT THIS IS
A PLACE OF BUSINESS,

35:19.518 --> 35:21.490
AND THEY NEED
TO KEEP THEIR KIDS AT HOME!

35:21.490 --> 35:24.253
THEN I GUESS YOU SHOULD
YELL AT ME.

35:24.253 --> 35:27.396
THESE ARE MY KIDS.
 (whispers)
COME HERE, SWEETIE.

35:27.396 --> 35:29.698
(under breath) OH, JEEZ.

35:29.698 --> 35:31.900
(normal voice) I, UH,
I DIDN'T KNOW THAT.

35:31.900 --> 35:35.504
I-I THOUGHT THEY WERE HERS
'CAUSE THEY'RE... (sighs)

35:35.504 --> 35:37.436
(whispers)
COULD YOU JUST GO?

35:37.436 --> 35:39.308
(normal voice) UM...

35:39.308 --> 35:41.440
I'M SORRY.

35:41.440 --> 35:44.673
SO WHAT IF THEY WERE?

35:44.673 --> 35:48.577
THAT'S THE WAY
YOU TALK TO PEOPLE?
 I SAID I'M SORRY.

35:48.577 --> 35:50.879
LOOK, I-I AM TRYING SO HARD
TO MAKE THIS DEAL HAPPEN.

35:50.879 --> 35:53.352
I GUESS THE STRESS
IS JUST GETTING TO ME.

35:53.352 --> 35:55.554
IT'S GETTING ALL OF US.
MAYBE IT'S A SIGN

35:55.554 --> 35:58.557
WE SHOULD CHANGE THE WAY
WE DO THINGS AROUND HERE.

35:58.557 --> 36:00.589
WE ARE TRYING TO PLAY
WITH THE BIG BOYS, CARLOS.

36:00.589 --> 36:02.731
NOW IS NOT THE TIME
TO PULL BACK.

36:02.731 --> 36:04.733
DON'T YOU WANT THIS COMPANY
TO SUCCEED?

36:04.733 --> 36:07.766
I WANNA BUILD A COMPANY
THAT TREATS ITS PEOPLE WELL

36:07.766 --> 36:10.469
AND LETS THEM GO HOME AT NIGHT
TO SEE THEIR FAMILIES.

36:10.469 --> 36:13.171
LOOK, I KNOW I DON'T HAVE
THE GREATEST BESIDE MANNER.

36:13.171 --> 36:15.474
BUT YOU HIRED ME TO
TAKE THIS COMPANY TO NUMBER ONE.

36:15.474 --> 36:17.476
NOW IF YOU DON'T WANT
TO DO THAT,

36:17.476 --> 36:19.608
I'M PROBABLY NOT YOUR GIRL.

36:19.608 --> 36:22.481
I WAS JUST THINKING
THE SAME THING.

36:22.481 --> 36:24.353
WOW.

36:24.353 --> 36:25.814
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU?

36:25.814 --> 36:28.417
THE OLD CARLOS WOULD
DO ANYTHING TO BE THE BEST.

36:28.417 --> 36:31.560
I GUESS I'M NOT
THE OLD CARLOS ANYMORE.

36:36.525 --> 36:37.926
FINE.

36:42.601 --> 36:46.905
(singsongy) DON'T FORGET
YOUR LITTLE ANIMALS!

36:56.915 --> 37:00.419
(sighs)

37:00.419 --> 37:03.292
ORSON,
PLEASE COME UPSTAIRS.

37:03.292 --> 37:05.824
I KNOW WHAT THAT COUCH DOES
TO YOUR BACK.

37:05.824 --> 37:08.797
DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME.
I'LL BE FINE.

37:08.797 --> 37:11.830
I KNOW YOU'RE DISAPPOINTED
RIGHT NOW, BUT YOU HAVE TO KNOW,

37:11.830 --> 37:15.564
I REALLY DO WANT TO FIND
SOME WAY FOR YOU TO BE HAPPY.

37:15.564 --> 37:18.507
SO DO I.

37:31.580 --> 37:33.582
(door closes)

37:40.289 --> 37:42.761
(chuckles)

37:42.761 --> 37:44.763
(sighs)

37:44.763 --> 37:46.765
HEY, DON'T YOU WANT
YOUR STUFF?

37:46.765 --> 37:49.938
OH, CAN I GET IT TOMORROW?
I JUST REALLY WANT TO GET HOME.

38:03.812 --> 38:07.616
EDIE?

38:10.058 --> 38:11.720
I ALWAYS WONDERED

38:11.720 --> 38:14.723
WHY YOU WERE SO DETERMINED
TO LIVE ON WISTERIA LANE.

38:17.526 --> 38:19.828
YOU SAID YOU THOUGHT
WE'D BE HAPPY HERE,

38:19.828 --> 38:22.371
AND I WANTED TO BELIEVE YOU.

38:24.773 --> 38:27.436
BUT IT TURNED OUT THAT YOU...

38:27.436 --> 38:31.079
JUST WANTED TO BE CLOSE
TO MIKE DELFINO.

38:33.311 --> 38:35.544
WHO GAVE YOU THAT?

38:35.544 --> 38:38.046
NOBODY GAVE IT TO ME.

38:38.046 --> 38:41.690
I DID RESEARCH. YOU THINK
I'M TOO STUPID TO DO RESEARCH?

38:41.690 --> 38:44.493
EDIE, LISTEN.
THIS DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING.

38:44.493 --> 38:47.496
IT'S ALL THERE--THE ACCIDENT,
MIKE'S ACQUITTAL,

38:47.496 --> 38:50.629
AND EVEN A LITTLE MENTION
OF HOW...

38:50.629 --> 38:52.801
DAVID DASH

38:52.801 --> 38:55.434
COULDN'T MAKE IT
TO THE FUNERAL

38:55.434 --> 38:57.606
BECAUSE HE HAD
A NERVOUS BREAKDOWN.

38:58.907 --> 39:00.709
HONEY, LOOK.

39:00.709 --> 39:03.412
JUST GIVE ME A CHANCE
TO EXPLAIN.

39:03.412 --> 39:06.545
OH, SO NOW YOU WANT
TO EXPLAIN?

39:06.545 --> 39:08.877
(liquid pouring)

39:08.877 --> 39:11.720
OKAY, WHY DON'T YOU START

39:11.720 --> 39:14.553
BY EXPLAINING
WHY YOU MARRIED ME?

39:17.386 --> 39:19.658
I MARRIED YOU
BECAUSE I LOVE YOU.

39:19.658 --> 39:23.592
NO! YOU MARRIED ME BECAUSE
YOU NEEDED A COVER STORY

39:23.592 --> 39:26.595
SO YOU COULD GET CLOSE TO
THE MAN WHO KILLED YOUR FAMILY.

39:26.595 --> 39:27.836
THAT'S RIDICULOUS.

39:27.836 --> 39:29.498
YEAH, IT'S INSANE.

39:29.498 --> 39:31.500
BUT THAT'S WHY YOU DID IT.

39:31.500 --> 39:34.403
SO WHAT ARE YOU
GONNA DO NOW?

39:34.403 --> 39:36.545
YOU GONNA HURT HIM?

39:37.846 --> 39:39.678
I MEAN...

39:39.678 --> 39:42.781
(sighs) YOU KNOW,
THAT'S THE ONLY...
 (crumples paper)

39:42.781 --> 39:44.713
LOGICAL EXPLANATION.

39:44.713 --> 39:49.558
AND MY ONLY QUESTION IS...

39:49.558 --> 39:51.860
WHAT THE HELL
HAVE YOU BEEN WAITING FOR?

39:51.860 --> 39:55.924
HONEY,
YOU'RE NOT FEELING WELL.

39:55.924 --> 39:58.066
LET'S GET YOU UPSTAIRS
INTO BED.

39:58.066 --> 40:01.029
TELL ME THE TRUTH,
YOU FREAK.

40:01.029 --> 40:04.973
DID YOU MOVE US HERE
TO HURT MIKE DELFINO?

40:08.877 --> 40:10.839
HE DESTROYED...

40:10.839 --> 40:13.582
EVERYTHING I EVER LOVED,

40:13.582 --> 40:15.584
AND HE WAS NEVER PUNISHED.

40:15.584 --> 40:17.916
(sighs)

40:17.916 --> 40:22.591
I NEED TO MAKE THINGS RIGHT.

40:22.591 --> 40:24.653
(cries) WHY?

40:24.653 --> 40:28.997
WHY DID YOU HAVE TO DO THIS?

40:28.997 --> 40:32.430
(crying) WE COULD'VE BEEN
SO HAPPY.

40:32.430 --> 40:33.762
(sniffles)

40:33.762 --> 40:35.764
(sighs)

40:38.036 --> 40:40.509
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

40:40.509 --> 40:42.741
I'M GONNA TELL HIM
BEFORE YOU...
 (beeping)

40:42.741 --> 40:45.213
BEFORE YOU DO
SOMETHING STUPID.
 EDIE, DON'T.

40:45.213 --> 40:48.617
(phone rings)

40:48.617 --> 40:52.220
GIVE ME THAT.

40:52.220 --> 40:53.221
(beep)

40:53.221 --> 40:54.683
NO! AAH!

40:54.683 --> 40:56.555
(grunts)
 (gags)

40:56.555 --> 40:58.226
(telephone receiver drops)

40:58.226 --> 41:01.530
(grunting)

41:09.538 --> 41:12.941
(gasping
and breathing deeply)

41:12.941 --> 41:17.475
(cries)

41:17.475 --> 41:20.048
(gasping)

41:20.048 --> 41:22.611
(crying)

41:24.683 --> 41:26.685
(door opens)

41:26.685 --> 41:30.689
(rapid footsteps retreating,
Edie crying)

41:35.724 --> 41:38.096
(creak)

41:38.096 --> 41:42.531
GET OUT OF HERE!
JUST GET THE HELL OUT!

41:42.531 --> 41:45.934
I'M CALLING THE POLICE!
DO YOU HEAR ME?

41:49.808 --> 41:52.741
(beeping)

41:56.144 --> 41:57.515
(cries)

41:57.515 --> 41:58.647
AAH!

41:58.647 --> 41:59.788
(tires squeal)

41:59.788 --> 42:01.690
AAH!

42:01.690 --> 42:02.691
(loud pop)

42:02.691 --> 42:04.853
(electricity crackling)

42:10.759 --> 42:15.664
YES,
LIFE IS FULL OF NASTY SHOCKS.

42:15.664 --> 42:17.866
AND THEY ALWAYS SEEM TO OCCUR

42:17.866 --> 42:21.539
WHEN WE LEAST EXPECT THEM.

42:26.715 --> 42:29.618
(crackling)

42:32.581 --> 42:34.923
(electricity popping)

42:34.923 --> 42:38.657
AND ONCE OUR SYSTEM
HAS BEEN JOLTED,

42:38.657 --> 42:42.631
THE QUESTION BECOMES,
WILL WE SURVIVE?
