00:27.778 --> 00:30.197
MOTHER:
You must be so tired.

00:30.281 --> 00:31.449
Okay.

00:31.532 --> 00:33.451
Well, I'll sing the song.

00:33.534 --> 00:34.618
What? No.

00:34.702 --> 00:37.037
:
Nobody films. Daddy, no.

00:37.121 --> 00:38.789
I'm n-not filming.
There's no phone.

00:38.873 --> 00:40.541
MOTHER:
I look ancient. Look at me.

00:40.624 --> 00:42.251
-I-I'm not filming.
-Okay.

00:42.334 --> 00:43.878
FATHER:
It's off.

00:43.961 --> 00:48.090
MOTHER:

01:15.993 --> 01:18.829
:

02:13.551 --> 02:16.345
You can come say hi if you want.

02:16.428 --> 02:18.097
FATHER:
Yeah, I don't know, bud.

02:18.180 --> 02:22.059
I, uh... I don't think that Mom
wants to see me right now.

02:22.142 --> 02:24.061
But she called and said

02:24.144 --> 02:27.064
she'd be waiting for you
with open arms, so go ahead.

02:27.147 --> 02:28.732
Go, go, go.

02:30.651 --> 02:32.069
Be nice to your mother.

02:34.738 --> 02:36.323
Mommy?

02:38.868 --> 02:40.494
Mom?

02:42.663 --> 02:44.415
LUKAS:
Mom?

02:51.171 --> 02:52.923
Outside?

03:13.694 --> 03:15.195
LUKAS:
Elias.

03:16.238 --> 03:17.948
Come on.

03:24.413 --> 03:26.248
-Mommy?
-Mom?

03:50.522 --> 03:52.566
MOTHER:
You're early.

03:52.650 --> 03:55.110
I was still getting ready.

03:55.194 --> 03:58.322
I know... I know this is weird.

03:58.405 --> 04:00.282
I-I wanted to...

04:00.366 --> 04:03.994
I did try and call ahead of time
to explain things, but...

04:05.329 --> 04:07.748
Um... anyway, it doesn't matter.

04:07.831 --> 04:09.416
You're here now.

04:11.126 --> 04:13.295
And look at you.

04:13.379 --> 04:15.005
So grown up.

04:15.089 --> 04:17.049
You're gaining on me.

04:19.051 --> 04:21.679
Believe me, I...

04:21.762 --> 04:23.722
I hate that you have to see me like this,

04:23.806 --> 04:26.350
but it's nothing to be afraid of.

04:26.433 --> 04:28.352
It's still me under here.

04:30.312 --> 04:33.065
Mommy just had a...

04:33.148 --> 04:35.442
a little procedure.

04:35.526 --> 04:36.860
A surgery.

04:36.944 --> 04:38.862
Are you sick?

04:38.946 --> 04:40.823
No, no, I'm not sick. I promise.

04:40.906 --> 04:42.658
Everything's fine.

04:42.741 --> 04:45.035
It's just...

04:45.119 --> 04:48.122
I don't know, I needed a...

04:48.205 --> 04:50.290
change, fresh start.

04:52.292 --> 04:54.294
You know, like, when a car gets older

04:54.378 --> 04:57.214
and you have to take it in for repairs?

04:57.297 --> 04:59.758
People can be like that, too.

04:59.842 --> 05:02.469
:
Sometimes you just need a little tune-up.

05:03.470 --> 05:05.472
Dad didn't say anything.

05:09.977 --> 05:11.979
Well, I was hoping

05:12.062 --> 05:14.815
this could be our little secret.

05:16.191 --> 05:17.693
What do you think?

05:19.695 --> 05:21.530
LUKAS:
Where are my headphones?

05:21.613 --> 05:24.158
I thought I left them here.

05:26.869 --> 05:29.288
What do you think
she looks like under there?

05:31.165 --> 05:33.625
Remember when we saw
that raccoon that got run over

05:33.709 --> 05:35.669
and there was all that,
like, blood and white stuff

05:35.753 --> 05:37.963
-all over the road?
-Ew. Stop. Stop it.

05:38.047 --> 05:39.548
-Gross. Stop it. That's Mom!
-Probably like that

05:39.631 --> 05:41.050
but all over Mom's face, like...

05:41.133 --> 05:42.676
-Like, oozing blood...
-I said stop it!

05:42.760 --> 05:44.428
MOTHER:
Is there something wrong?

05:47.139 --> 05:49.099
-Nope.
-No, Mommy.

05:49.183 --> 05:50.517
Okay, good.

05:50.601 --> 05:53.479
I just wanted everything to be perfect.

05:53.562 --> 05:56.774
Anyway, I, um... I got you something,

05:56.857 --> 06:00.027
but you got here
before I had a chance to wrap it.

06:02.237 --> 06:03.781
What is it?

06:03.864 --> 06:05.949
An F-18 Super Hornet.

06:09.453 --> 06:11.330
So you like it?

06:11.413 --> 06:13.123
-So much. Thank you, Mommy.
-Yeah.

06:13.207 --> 06:14.291
Oh, good.

06:14.374 --> 06:16.877
Now, if I can get you to help me

06:16.960 --> 06:20.172
with a few little house rules.

06:20.255 --> 06:22.091
Just while Mommy's healing.

06:23.092 --> 06:24.510
Rules?

06:24.593 --> 06:26.095
Like what?

06:26.178 --> 06:28.180
Easy things.

06:28.263 --> 06:30.682
Like no running or shouting in the house,

06:30.766 --> 06:33.685
and no visitors or playdates.

06:33.769 --> 06:36.355
Just for a while,
just for some peace and quiet.

06:36.438 --> 06:38.857
And the sun,
it's not good for Mommy's skin,

06:38.941 --> 06:41.652
so let's keep the blinds closed.

06:41.735 --> 06:46.657
And my office and my bedroom: off-limits.

06:46.740 --> 06:48.325
So's the barn.

06:49.409 --> 06:51.161
Uh, but what about if...

06:51.245 --> 06:53.080
And no arguing, okay?

06:53.163 --> 06:55.582
What Mommy says goes.

06:55.666 --> 06:57.751
You think you can do that?

06:58.794 --> 07:00.587
Yeah, sure.

07:01.588 --> 07:04.216
Elias, do you hear me?

07:04.299 --> 07:05.801
Yes, Mommy.

07:05.884 --> 07:07.302
Good.

07:08.887 --> 07:10.389
Good.

07:11.640 --> 07:13.016
Hey.

07:13.100 --> 07:14.977
Why don't you run outside and play?

07:15.060 --> 07:17.896
-You can unpack later.

07:20.524 --> 07:21.650
Mommy?

07:21.733 --> 07:23.610
Yeah?

07:24.653 --> 07:26.446
I made this for you.

07:28.240 --> 07:30.534
Thank you, sweetie.

08:07.529 --> 08:09.698
Since when do you have a phone?

08:10.824 --> 08:12.534
It's Dad's old phone.

08:12.618 --> 08:14.453
He gave it to us.

08:14.536 --> 08:18.081
Don't want you spending
all your time on that thing.

08:19.124 --> 08:21.585
We could do something together.

08:22.961 --> 08:25.797
It's been a long day, Elias.

08:25.881 --> 08:28.508
But we're not tired.

08:28.592 --> 08:30.510
It's not even 8:00.

08:31.970 --> 08:34.056
-No, wait!

08:34.139 --> 08:36.016
There it is. Yes of course. I see it.

08:36.099 --> 08:38.560
It's something dark and sinister.

08:38.644 --> 08:42.814
You are in grave danger.

08:42.898 --> 08:44.816
MOTHER:
"His yellow skin

08:44.900 --> 08:49.321
"scarcely covered the work
of muscles and arteries beneath;

08:49.404 --> 08:53.367
"his hair was of a lustrous black,

08:53.450 --> 08:56.620
"and flowing;

08:56.703 --> 08:59.915
"his teeth of a pearly whiteness;

08:59.998 --> 09:04.503
"but these only formed
a more horrid contrast

09:04.586 --> 09:09.049
"with his watery eyes,
his shriveled complexion

09:09.132 --> 09:12.010
and straight black lips."

09:16.640 --> 09:18.475
Good night.

09:24.439 --> 09:26.275
You-you didn't sing the song.

09:30.612 --> 09:33.031
MOTHER:
Not tonight, Elias.

09:33.115 --> 09:35.659
But you always sing the song.

09:37.869 --> 09:40.414
You're too old for songs.

09:40.497 --> 09:41.957
Close your eyes.

09:42.040 --> 09:44.042
You'll be asleep before you know it.

09:53.927 --> 09:55.137
LUKAS:
What?

09:56.471 --> 09:58.557
I didn't say anything.

09:58.640 --> 10:01.018
I can hear you thinking.

10:03.520 --> 10:05.272
It's nothing.

10:10.360 --> 10:13.989
Don't you think something's different?

10:15.240 --> 10:17.075
With Mom?

10:18.785 --> 10:21.538
What if it's been so long
since we saw her...

10:23.749 --> 10:27.044
...that she doesn't like us anymore?

10:28.086 --> 10:30.547
She's our mom. She has to like us.

10:30.630 --> 10:32.299
It's her job.

10:55.322 --> 10:58.116
BOTH:

11:57.551 --> 11:59.469
...for the entire tristate area,

11:59.553 --> 12:01.638
a severe thunderstorm warning
beginning tomorrow evening

12:01.721 --> 12:03.723
and lasting until early Friday.

12:20.907 --> 12:22.742
Hide-and-seek in the woods?

12:22.826 --> 12:24.536
You can hide first.

12:26.872 --> 12:28.957
Hey, Elias.

12:29.040 --> 12:30.667
Elias.

12:32.252 --> 12:34.713
What do you call the better-looking twin?

12:36.798 --> 12:38.341
What?

12:38.425 --> 12:41.136
Well, most people just call me Lukas.

12:54.858 --> 12:57.319
Maybe she shut it up last winter.

13:03.241 --> 13:05.327
Mom said not to.

13:05.410 --> 13:07.412
Elias!

14:23.029 --> 14:25.615
LUKAS:
Elias, what are you doing up there?

14:33.206 --> 14:35.125
What were you doing in there?

14:35.208 --> 14:37.794
I gave you specific instructions.

14:37.877 --> 14:40.547
-Stay where I could see you.
-It wasn't my fault.

14:40.630 --> 14:43.216
Oh, 'cause nothing is ever
your fault, is it?

14:43.300 --> 14:45.635
No, Mommy, we only went
in there for a second.

14:45.719 --> 14:47.178
Do not say another word.

14:47.262 --> 14:49.264
-Lukas lost his baseball glove, and...
-Stop talking!

14:54.686 --> 14:57.689
From now on, you stay inside.

15:06.573 --> 15:08.366
You okay?

15:11.369 --> 15:13.371
I didn't mean to get us in trouble.

15:14.456 --> 15:16.291
You didn't do anything wrong.

15:18.543 --> 15:20.754
You didn't do anything wrong.

15:32.682 --> 15:35.310
-Sorry.

15:39.814 --> 15:41.733
That spot in the barn...

15:44.569 --> 15:46.905
I think it was blood.

15:49.574 --> 15:51.493
What spot?

15:51.576 --> 15:53.620
The one on the wall.

15:55.872 --> 15:57.957
Probably just paint or something.

16:52.637 --> 16:53.972
MOTHER:
Yeah, that's the problem.

16:54.055 --> 16:56.433
He's never apart from Lukas.

17:01.187 --> 17:03.314
MOTHER:
I caught him sneaking into the barn today.

17:03.398 --> 17:05.859
I'm telling you,
he knows something's wrong.

17:16.369 --> 17:18.455
Well, I-I just...
I don't think I can stand

17:18.538 --> 17:20.081
another second in this house.

17:20.165 --> 17:22.917
I need to put an end to it.

17:23.001 --> 17:25.628
I need him gone.

17:27.505 --> 17:31.301
Just how much longer
do I have to keep pretending?

17:35.513 --> 17:37.265
Hold on.

18:37.242 --> 18:39.369
LUKAS:
What did she mean, "pretending"?

18:39.452 --> 18:41.621
ELIAS:
I don't know.

18:41.704 --> 18:44.916
But she doesn't like
that we're always together.

18:44.999 --> 18:46.876
Huh.

18:46.960 --> 18:49.212
What?

18:58.555 --> 19:00.390
MOTHER:
Good morning.

19:06.646 --> 19:08.523
I heard the laundry.

19:08.606 --> 19:10.817
You washing something?

19:13.486 --> 19:14.946
Hello?

19:15.029 --> 19:16.990
What's in the wash?

19:17.073 --> 19:19.075
My sheets.

19:31.963 --> 19:33.464
MOTHER:
Hello?

19:33.548 --> 19:35.592
-Is now a good time?
-Just a second.

19:55.069 --> 19:56.821
I can't hear anything.

19:58.072 --> 19:59.699
Me, neither.

20:03.870 --> 20:05.455
Say something.

20:06.497 --> 20:08.374
:
Hello?

20:08.458 --> 20:11.294
ANNOUNCER :
...with no food, no water,

20:11.377 --> 20:14.756
-no clothes,

20:14.839 --> 20:18.343
do they have the skill
and the will to survive?

20:19.928 --> 20:22.221
Naked and Afraid.

20:42.909 --> 20:44.827
Where do I put it?

20:44.911 --> 20:46.913
Somewhere she won't look.

20:56.881 --> 20:58.716
Her medicine.

21:00.343 --> 21:03.262
Says "may cause drowsiness."

21:03.346 --> 21:04.847
I hope she took a lot.

21:04.931 --> 21:07.392
Just put it under the bed.

22:07.618 --> 22:09.203
:
In there.

27:31.901 --> 27:33.819
ELIAS:
I told you something was wrong with her.

27:33.903 --> 27:37.281
And why was she smoking?
She hates smoking.

27:40.910 --> 27:42.453
What?

27:46.665 --> 27:48.667
Lukas, what? Tell me.

27:53.130 --> 27:56.342
Remember when Mom said
we were too old for our song?

27:57.718 --> 28:00.971
What if she didn't sing it
because she didn't know the words?

28:03.474 --> 28:05.726
She sang it every bedtime.

28:05.810 --> 28:08.479
Yeah, Mom did.

28:12.024 --> 28:14.318
I don't think that's our mother.

28:16.529 --> 28:18.739
No.

28:18.823 --> 28:20.658
No, that...

28:20.741 --> 28:23.160
No, th-that makes no sense.

28:23.244 --> 28:24.620
She said she's been pretending.

28:24.703 --> 28:26.122
You're just trying to scare me.

28:26.205 --> 28:28.666
-Pretending to be her.
-Stop it.

28:28.749 --> 28:31.961
Tell me you know that's her for sure,
and I'll stop.

28:42.138 --> 28:43.764
LUKAS:
There.

28:43.848 --> 28:45.307
ELIAS:
Wh-What?

28:46.350 --> 28:47.977
Look at her eyes.

28:58.362 --> 29:00.072
Green.

29:02.408 --> 29:04.326
Blue.

29:08.456 --> 29:10.040
You know I'm right.

29:10.124 --> 29:12.042
That's proof.

29:12.126 --> 29:13.544
Try Dad again.

29:13.627 --> 29:15.546
He's not answering.

29:15.629 --> 29:17.047
Then leave a message.

29:19.008 --> 29:20.885
MOTHER:
Hello?

29:21.927 --> 29:23.471
-Don't come in.

29:23.554 --> 29:25.681
MOTHER:
Come on, open up.

29:25.764 --> 29:28.100
You know I don't like
locked doors in this house.

29:30.352 --> 29:31.896
What are you doing in there?

29:31.979 --> 29:34.106
Nothing.

29:34.190 --> 29:36.525
Okay, well, look, I...

29:36.609 --> 29:38.986
I know things between us haven't been...

29:39.069 --> 29:40.779
seamless.

29:41.822 --> 29:43.574
I'd like to start over.

29:44.617 --> 29:46.368
Forgive and forget.

29:49.663 --> 29:51.457
I made dinner.

29:51.540 --> 29:53.417
Chicken nuggets.

29:56.128 --> 29:57.755
Hello?

29:59.423 --> 30:01.383
We're not hungry.

30:11.852 --> 30:14.188
Well, you'll have to come out eventually.

30:17.650 --> 30:19.276
:
Call Dad.

30:28.869 --> 30:30.037
MOTHER :
You're not filming this.

30:30.120 --> 30:31.288
FATHER:
I'm not filming. Who's filming?

30:31.372 --> 30:32.581
-No one's filming.
-Come on, honey.

30:32.665 --> 30:34.500
I look ancient. Please.

30:34.583 --> 30:36.669
-No, you-you look terrific.
-Please. Turn it off.

30:36.752 --> 30:38.087
She looks beautiful.

30:38.170 --> 30:40.214
-Do the song.

30:40.297 --> 30:44.552
MOTHER:

31:18.252 --> 31:19.587
MOTHER:
Where is it?

31:19.670 --> 31:21.505
Get up.

31:21.589 --> 31:22.673
What?

31:22.756 --> 31:24.133
Tell me where it is.

31:24.216 --> 31:26.010
-What?
-What are you talking about?

31:26.093 --> 31:27.595
Don't pretend you're stupid.

31:27.678 --> 31:29.096
You're not stupid.

31:29.179 --> 31:30.848
The phone-- give it to me.

31:30.931 --> 31:32.933
-But we didn't do anything.

31:33.017 --> 31:34.852
You're lying.

31:34.935 --> 31:38.772
You lied to me, you disobeyed,
and you called your father.

31:38.856 --> 31:41.400
Now, the last thing I need
is that man up my ass

31:41.483 --> 31:43.193
about whatever stories you're telling him!

31:43.277 --> 31:45.279
-But we aren't lying! We didn't call Da...
-Shut up!

31:45.362 --> 31:47.364
Do not speak.

31:47.448 --> 31:49.283
Just give me the phone.

31:50.326 --> 31:51.660
No.

31:51.744 --> 31:53.120
-Give it. Give...
-Stop it!

31:53.203 --> 31:55.205
-You can't take that! Stop it! Stop!
-It's not yours!

31:59.877 --> 32:01.795
-Wait.
-Where are you going?

32:04.381 --> 32:05.966
Stop!

32:06.050 --> 32:07.426
What are you doing?

32:07.509 --> 32:08.886
Give it back!

32:08.969 --> 32:12.181
You need to learn what lying costs you.

32:15.934 --> 32:18.228
This is what happens
when you don't tell the truth.

32:27.112 --> 32:29.114
That's not fair.

32:29.198 --> 32:30.658
Fair?

32:31.700 --> 32:34.370
You think any of this is fair?

32:34.453 --> 32:37.206
You think I wanted this?
You think I'm enjoying this?

32:47.633 --> 32:49.176
LUKAS:
I'll take first watch.

32:49.259 --> 32:51.261
You can sleep.

33:17.454 --> 33:19.665
What is that?

33:23.627 --> 33:25.295
That's her.

36:06.623 --> 36:09.084
What are you doing?

36:09.167 --> 36:10.627
-Answer me.

36:12.337 --> 36:14.131
Answer me.

36:16.008 --> 36:17.342
Fuck!

36:17.426 --> 36:19.469
What is wrong with you?!

36:19.553 --> 36:21.096
Come back here!

36:23.640 --> 36:24.933
What's going on?

36:26.476 --> 36:28.437
I just wanted to know for sure.

36:34.109 --> 36:38.071
MOTHER:
Elias, we do not lock doors in this house.

36:43.201 --> 36:44.828
Sweetie, I'm not mad at you.

36:44.912 --> 36:47.039
I just...

36:47.122 --> 36:48.957
I just want to talk.

36:49.041 --> 36:50.667
Go away.

36:55.839 --> 36:57.507
-Open the fucking door!

36:59.843 --> 37:02.429
Okay, I'm counting to three.

37:03.722 --> 37:04.932
One.

37:07.726 --> 37:09.394
Two.

37:37.464 --> 37:38.840
Fuck!

37:46.264 --> 37:48.684
I've tried to be good to you.

37:48.767 --> 37:50.435
I've been understanding.

37:50.519 --> 37:52.521
I've tried playing along.

37:52.604 --> 37:55.232
I've done everything I was supposed to do.

37:55.315 --> 37:58.318
And this is how you treat me.

37:58.402 --> 38:00.529
Your own mother.

38:00.612 --> 38:02.489
You're not our mother.

38:03.991 --> 38:05.575
What did you say?

38:06.576 --> 38:08.412
Elias, don't.

38:09.579 --> 38:11.039
Speak up.

38:12.165 --> 38:13.834
Get up.

38:20.966 --> 38:22.718
Elias.

38:27.264 --> 38:29.099
You're not our mother.

38:30.684 --> 38:33.311
That's a terrible thing to say.

38:34.563 --> 38:36.273
Don't.

38:36.356 --> 38:37.983
Our mother loved us.

38:40.318 --> 38:42.237
Take that back.

38:42.320 --> 38:43.572
We don't love you, either.

38:43.655 --> 38:45.115
We hate you.

38:45.198 --> 38:46.783
Lukas, tell her.

38:46.867 --> 38:48.702
Don't talk to him! Talk to me!

38:48.785 --> 38:50.704
What did you do to our mom? Where is she?

38:50.787 --> 38:52.372
You're lying, Elias.

38:52.456 --> 38:54.082
-You're not telling the truth.
-I'm not lying.

38:54.166 --> 38:55.375
-You are.
-Say it!

38:55.459 --> 38:57.377
-Say I'm your mother!
-Ow! You're hurting me!

38:57.461 --> 38:59.129
-Say it!
-No!

38:59.212 --> 39:01.298
-Stop!
-I have coddled you too much.

39:01.381 --> 39:03.467
Not anymore. Things are gonna change.

39:03.550 --> 39:05.427
-Do you hear me, Elias?

39:05.510 --> 39:06.928
Let go of me!

39:08.346 --> 39:10.265
-No more talking to your brother.
-Stop it!

39:10.348 --> 39:12.601
-Stop! Stop!
-No more lies.

39:13.643 --> 39:15.645
-Stop it!
-Say it.

39:16.772 --> 39:19.149
-"You are my mother."
-Stop! It's cold!

39:19.232 --> 39:20.692
"You are my mother."

39:20.776 --> 39:22.194
Say it.

39:23.403 --> 39:26.364
-"You are my mother."
-No! Please.

39:26.448 --> 39:28.283
"You are my mother."

39:28.366 --> 39:31.286
Say it. Elias.

39:31.369 --> 39:34.206
"You are my mother."

39:34.289 --> 39:36.166
You are my mother.

39:37.334 --> 39:38.710
You are my mother.

39:38.794 --> 39:40.796
You are my mother. You are my mother.

39:42.172 --> 39:43.882
You are my mother.

41:46.963 --> 41:48.673
We need to leave.

41:52.677 --> 41:54.679
It's not safe here.

42:08.318 --> 42:09.861
Come on!

42:22.457 --> 42:24.209
Hello! We need help!

42:24.292 --> 42:25.835
-Open up, please!
-Open up!

42:25.919 --> 42:27.462
Please open the door!

42:27.545 --> 42:29.297
Help us, please!

42:36.304 --> 42:37.931
Nobody's here.

42:58.410 --> 43:00.412
Power's out.

43:35.572 --> 43:37.574
Phone's dead, too.

43:39.784 --> 43:42.287
We'll have to stay here
till the storm ends.

43:55.300 --> 43:57.802
I wonder where Mom is right now.

44:01.514 --> 44:03.350
Do you think she misses us?

44:04.392 --> 44:06.394
Of course she does.

44:11.733 --> 44:13.360
Do you...

44:17.655 --> 44:19.616
Do you think she's okay?

44:19.699 --> 44:23.036
Mom would fight, like,
a hundred million bad guys

44:23.119 --> 44:25.455
just to get to us.

44:25.538 --> 44:27.040
I'm sure she's fine.

44:50.021 --> 44:52.107
It's too quiet.

44:54.442 --> 44:55.860
Talk to me.

44:56.903 --> 44:58.488
LUKAS:
About what?

44:58.571 --> 44:59.906
ELIAS:
I don't care.

44:59.989 --> 45:02.575
Anything.

45:02.659 --> 45:04.494
Tell me a story.

45:13.753 --> 45:15.171
Okay.

45:17.298 --> 45:18.591
Before we were born...

45:18.675 --> 45:19.884
If you're just gonna make fun...

45:19.968 --> 45:21.845
-I'm not.
-'Cause I'm not in the mood

45:21.928 --> 45:24.347
-for your dumb jokes.
-Elias, shut up.

45:27.392 --> 45:31.771
Before we were born,
when we were still so small

45:31.855 --> 45:35.650
that no one even noticed we were there,

45:35.733 --> 45:38.027
you and me were one person.

45:39.571 --> 45:41.489
Like how everybody is.

45:43.158 --> 45:45.577
And most people stay that way.

45:47.745 --> 45:49.747
But we were smart.

45:50.832 --> 45:53.376
We decided we would split into two.

45:55.003 --> 45:58.465
That way, we would never
have to be alone again.

46:42.509 --> 46:44.385
Lukas?

48:29.115 --> 48:31.200
Hey, hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey.

48:31.284 --> 48:33.995
Hey, you're all right, little man.

48:35.038 --> 48:36.956
Don't worry. Not in any trouble.

48:37.040 --> 48:38.875
I'm just here to help, okay?

48:38.958 --> 48:40.793
Hey, San?

48:41.919 --> 48:43.921
Come here and look what I found.

48:52.722 --> 48:55.099
This person... who is she?

48:57.393 --> 48:59.270
We don't know.

49:00.688 --> 49:03.483
Her face is all covered up.

49:03.566 --> 49:05.777
But she scares you?

49:07.236 --> 49:09.864
Tell her about the cold water.

49:09.947 --> 49:11.574
Hey, Sandy?

49:26.381 --> 49:28.049
GARY:
Okay.

49:28.132 --> 49:30.677
Priority number one.

49:30.760 --> 49:32.804
We got to get you out of here.

49:32.887 --> 49:35.306
-Where are we going?
-Somewhere safe.

49:35.390 --> 49:37.684
With an actual bed.

49:39.936 --> 49:41.813
I promise...

49:41.896 --> 49:43.773
I won't let anyone hurt you.

50:18.933 --> 50:20.351
No.

50:20.435 --> 50:22.103
They're taking us home.

50:22.186 --> 50:23.980
They can't.

50:24.063 --> 50:26.274
-Turn around!
-S-Stop.

50:26.357 --> 50:27.817
Stop the car.

50:28.860 --> 50:30.278
Please.

50:43.791 --> 50:45.626
GARY:
Okay.

50:45.710 --> 50:47.545
Out we go.

50:48.546 --> 50:50.631
You're angels, both of you.

50:50.715 --> 50:53.468
To be out there on a night like this?

50:53.551 --> 50:55.762
"Thank you" doesn't even cut it.

50:55.845 --> 50:57.305
GARY:
You should thank your neighbor.

50:57.388 --> 50:58.473
Oh.

50:58.556 --> 51:00.433
If not for their motion sensor, uh...

51:00.516 --> 51:04.061
I don't even want to imagine.

51:05.897 --> 51:08.900
Now, are-are you sure
I can't get you coffee or...

51:08.983 --> 51:10.526
SANDY:
Thanks, we're fine.

51:10.610 --> 51:12.236
Cocoa? Tea? Nothing?

51:12.320 --> 51:14.572
I'm sure the gas is still working.

51:14.655 --> 51:16.157
SANDY:
Really, we're okay.

51:16.240 --> 51:18.284
-There was one thing.
-Gary.

51:18.367 --> 51:20.077
GARY:
What?

51:20.161 --> 51:22.413
Now, if you don't mind--

51:22.497 --> 51:24.582
and, uh...

51:24.665 --> 51:26.751
feel a little embarrassed to ask you this,

51:26.834 --> 51:29.545
-but I was hoping that maybe
I could get a selfie. -Gary.

51:29.629 --> 51:30.755
Oh.

51:30.838 --> 51:32.215
GARY:
Well, I'm a huge fan, so...

51:32.298 --> 51:33.925
Oh.

51:34.008 --> 51:35.927
I didn't know there were any left.

51:36.010 --> 51:37.929
-Well, I...
-I'm flattered, honestly.

51:38.012 --> 51:42.183
But, um, I'm gonna have to take
a rain check, because...

51:42.266 --> 51:44.185
I don't have my face on, so...

51:44.268 --> 51:46.771
Oh, of course.
No, that's, uh... I shouldn't have.

51:46.854 --> 51:48.523
MOTHER:
Please, no. I...

51:48.606 --> 51:51.025
You know, I'm gonna send you
some signed headshots

51:51.108 --> 51:53.319
and Blu-rays down to the station.

51:53.402 --> 51:54.987
It's the least I can do.

51:55.071 --> 51:56.489
Well, look at that.

51:56.572 --> 51:58.616
Thank you.

51:58.699 --> 52:02.161
Uh, we do have
a few more things to discuss.

52:05.998 --> 52:08.209
Uh...

52:08.292 --> 52:11.045
Well, you must be freezing.

52:11.128 --> 52:14.131
Why don't you head upstairs,
run a hot bath.

52:14.215 --> 52:16.133
I'll be up in a second, okay?

52:37.613 --> 52:40.408
Anyone can change their face with surgery.

52:41.909 --> 52:44.412
She fooled the cops.

52:44.495 --> 52:46.956
Well, they don't know her.

52:49.208 --> 52:54.046
I mean, I'd be lying
if I said things have been normal,

52:54.130 --> 52:57.466
but to think I'm some impostor?

52:57.550 --> 52:59.552
SANDY:
We're just trying to get a full picture.

52:59.635 --> 53:00.928
MOTHER:
Mm, I know.

53:01.012 --> 53:03.514
GARY:
Purely protocol. Just checking a box.

53:03.598 --> 53:05.892
SANDY:
Um...

53:05.975 --> 53:08.269
Yeah, I can see how that might be

53:08.352 --> 53:10.897
uncomfortable to discuss.

53:10.980 --> 53:13.733
MOTHER:
But I would never lay a hand on my child.

53:13.816 --> 53:15.234
GARY:
No, no, of course not.

53:15.318 --> 53:17.945
-But, uh, we saw the lip, so...
-Yeah.

53:18.029 --> 53:19.572
GARY:
Had to check.

53:19.655 --> 53:21.324
SANDY:
Can I ask how it happened?

53:21.407 --> 53:22.783
Oh, yeah.

53:22.867 --> 53:24.827
He was playing by the pool

53:24.911 --> 53:27.038
and must have slipped on some water.

53:28.748 --> 53:32.543
I told him, what,
a million times to be careful.

53:32.627 --> 53:34.879
I always told them...

53:44.597 --> 53:47.266
I don't know what to do sometimes.

53:51.812 --> 53:54.565
It's, uh... terrifying.

53:54.649 --> 53:57.735
That line between...

53:57.818 --> 54:01.197
reality and fantasy...

54:01.280 --> 54:03.616
it's vanished.

54:06.869 --> 54:08.579
Thank you.

54:10.122 --> 54:13.751
I just feel really alone here sometimes.

54:13.834 --> 54:16.379
GARY:
Well, children, they imagine things,

54:16.462 --> 54:19.507
and that-that'll pass.

54:19.590 --> 54:22.426
MOTHER:
Oh, God, I hope you're right.

54:22.510 --> 54:24.345
Oh.

54:26.389 --> 54:28.849
GARY:
Well, we'd better get out of your hair.

54:31.394 --> 54:34.105
MOTHER:
I really have no words.

54:34.188 --> 54:35.648
But I will be sleeping well tonight.

54:35.731 --> 54:37.233
-We all will be,

54:37.316 --> 54:40.277
under the same roof, safe and sound,

54:40.361 --> 54:41.570
thanks to you guys.

54:42.863 --> 54:43.990
GARY:
Well, take care.

54:44.073 --> 54:46.242
And I'm gonna get you those Blu-rays.

54:46.325 --> 54:48.077
-Okay. Thank you.

54:48.160 --> 54:49.829
-Good night.
-Thank you.

55:00.089 --> 55:02.842
No one's gonna believe two little kids.

55:04.677 --> 55:06.679
Not while she's around.

55:08.931 --> 55:10.975
So what do we do?

55:12.476 --> 55:14.895
In the morning, we try again.

55:18.065 --> 55:19.483
No.

55:20.526 --> 55:22.445
We need to find Mom.

55:31.203 --> 55:33.205
They're gone now.

55:34.290 --> 55:36.876
No one here but you and me.

55:57.063 --> 56:00.024
Do you have any idea
what you put me through tonight?

56:06.155 --> 56:09.116
I went out there
looking for you in a storm.

56:09.200 --> 56:12.369
Had to take my bandage off
three days early.

56:12.453 --> 56:14.997
You're lucky I'm not disfigured.

56:17.249 --> 56:19.919
I know you're not asleep.

56:26.842 --> 56:29.095
That's fine.

56:29.178 --> 56:31.180
You can ignore me,

56:31.263 --> 56:35.518
be afraid of me if you want to be,
hate me,

56:35.601 --> 56:38.145
but I'm not going anywhere.

56:38.229 --> 56:40.773
You'll learn to love me someday.

58:58.160 --> 59:00.162
This some kind of game?

59:05.417 --> 59:07.044
I'm not playing.

59:08.087 --> 59:10.089
Where's Mom?

59:31.193 --> 59:32.903
:
Okay.

59:34.446 --> 59:36.949
Okay, let's make a deal.

59:37.032 --> 59:39.326
I promise,

59:39.410 --> 59:41.537
if you stop this now...

59:43.706 --> 59:46.083
...I will not be angry with you.

59:47.209 --> 59:49.169
I'll forgive you.

59:55.217 --> 59:57.261
Your eyes-- they're blue.

59:58.929 --> 1:00:00.347
Mom's are green.

1:00:01.682 --> 1:00:04.101
Is that what this is about?

1:00:04.184 --> 1:00:06.770
My eyes?

1:00:06.854 --> 1:00:08.063
Oh, my God.

1:00:08.147 --> 1:00:10.649
Elias, that's my headshot.

1:00:10.733 --> 1:00:12.693
I wear colored contacts for work.

1:00:12.776 --> 1:00:15.029
They're in my purse downstairs.

1:00:16.030 --> 1:00:17.531
Look at me.

1:00:17.614 --> 1:00:19.408
My eyes are blue.

1:00:29.126 --> 1:00:30.878
LUKAS:
This isn't working.

1:00:32.379 --> 1:00:35.007
If we leave now, we can still
make it to Dad before dark.

1:00:35.090 --> 1:00:37.092
I'm not giving up on Mom.

1:00:39.636 --> 1:00:41.472
Jesus Christ!

1:00:41.555 --> 1:00:43.015
Fuck.

1:00:43.098 --> 1:00:44.099
Where is she?

1:00:44.183 --> 1:00:45.559
Do not to do that to me again.

1:00:45.642 --> 1:00:46.685
Do you hear me?

1:00:46.769 --> 1:00:48.145
Now get those sciss...

1:00:48.228 --> 1:00:49.813
Shit.

1:00:49.897 --> 1:00:53.233
I swear to God, when I get up,
you are so...

1:00:53.317 --> 1:00:55.402
Where is she?

1:00:55.486 --> 1:00:57.404
How many ways do I have to say it?

1:00:57.488 --> 1:00:59.573
I'm right here, Elias.

1:01:00.616 --> 1:01:02.076
I fed you. I raised you.

1:01:02.159 --> 1:01:04.495
I stayed up at night with you.

1:01:04.578 --> 1:01:07.414
I did everything to make you happy.

1:01:07.498 --> 1:01:09.833
I'm your fucking mother!

1:01:13.921 --> 1:01:16.924
Look, w-we're wasting our time.

1:01:17.007 --> 1:01:19.802
She's just gonna keep lying
and making up excuses.

1:01:21.261 --> 1:01:23.263
Are you even listening to me?

1:01:26.475 --> 1:01:29.561
Jesus. What now?

1:01:33.232 --> 1:01:35.317
ELIAS:
Our mom doesn't throw away our drawings.

1:01:35.401 --> 1:01:36.568
She keeps them all,

1:01:36.652 --> 1:01:38.195
-even the bad ones.
-Okay.

1:01:38.278 --> 1:01:40.364
She-she saves them in a shoebox
in the back of her closet.

1:01:40.447 --> 1:01:41.907
-I get it.
-No!

1:01:41.990 --> 1:01:43.325
No, m-moms don't do this.

1:01:43.409 --> 1:01:45.077
Moms put Band-Aids on cuts.

1:01:45.160 --> 1:01:46.787
Moms play games with their kids.

1:01:46.870 --> 1:01:50.207
Moms... moms sing their boys
to sleep at night. Moms...

1:02:02.636 --> 1:02:05.639
LUKAS:
Elias, let's just go.

1:02:09.017 --> 1:02:10.811
:
Please, Elias.

1:02:10.894 --> 1:02:12.604
Please let me...

1:02:14.148 --> 1:02:16.150
LUKAS:
Let's just get out of here.

1:02:17.276 --> 1:02:19.278
You know this is me.

1:02:21.697 --> 1:02:24.658
You know it's me.

1:02:24.741 --> 1:02:26.368
LUKAS:
She's faking.

1:02:26.452 --> 1:02:28.287
She's been faking this entire time.

1:02:31.165 --> 1:02:33.083
We can't stay here any longer.

1:02:33.167 --> 1:02:35.085
We need to leave.

1:02:36.128 --> 1:02:38.046
Elias!

1:02:38.130 --> 1:02:39.506
What are you doing?

1:02:39.590 --> 1:02:41.341
Looking for her purse.

1:02:41.425 --> 1:02:42.968
Why?

1:02:43.051 --> 1:02:44.636
ELIAS:
She said her contacts are in there.

1:02:44.720 --> 1:02:46.472
LUKAS:
But she's lying.

1:02:46.555 --> 1:02:48.765
We can't believe a word she says.

1:02:48.849 --> 1:02:50.642
We need to be sure.

1:02:53.270 --> 1:02:56.857
Are we seriously gonna
search the whole house?

1:02:56.940 --> 1:02:59.318
It-It's here.

1:02:59.401 --> 1:03:01.320
I know I saw it somewhere.

1:03:01.403 --> 1:03:04.031
I'm telling you, we're wasting our time.

1:03:29.431 --> 1:03:31.433
LUKAS:
It's in here!

1:03:38.357 --> 1:03:41.652
No contacts, just like I said.

1:03:42.694 --> 1:03:44.530
-Are you sure?
-You don't believe me?

1:03:44.613 --> 1:03:45.822
No, I do, but...

1:03:45.906 --> 1:03:48.325
You're letting her get between us.

1:03:52.496 --> 1:03:55.040
We need to get somewhere safe,

1:03:55.123 --> 1:03:58.293
and then the first thing we'll do
is find Mom.

1:03:59.878 --> 1:04:01.797
We're gonna find her.

1:04:01.880 --> 1:04:03.632
I swear.

1:04:13.976 --> 1:04:16.186
LUKAS:
We can't trust anyone.

1:04:16.270 --> 1:04:19.147
We just have to call a car
and act like we do it all the time.

1:04:19.231 --> 1:04:21.483
We can't leave her there like this.

1:04:22.818 --> 1:04:25.904
If we untie her, she'll try to stop us.

1:04:28.949 --> 1:04:31.159
Trust me, it's gonna be fine.

1:04:31.243 --> 1:04:33.620
I'm just gonna go pack some food.

1:04:33.704 --> 1:04:36.665
Grab what you need,
and I'll meet you downstairs, okay?

1:04:53.140 --> 1:04:54.766
MOTHER:
Elias?

1:04:58.395 --> 1:05:00.856
Elias, baby, I know you're there.

1:05:05.861 --> 1:05:08.071
There's something I need to tell you.

1:05:20.792 --> 1:05:23.128
There you are.

1:05:23.211 --> 1:05:25.172
My sweet boy.

1:05:26.381 --> 1:05:29.217
You know, I've been thinking.

1:05:29.301 --> 1:05:31.386
And you...

1:05:31.470 --> 1:05:33.221
You're right.

1:05:34.973 --> 1:05:36.933
I haven't been myself.

1:05:38.268 --> 1:05:40.604
But...

1:05:40.687 --> 1:05:42.481
I'll be better.

1:05:43.899 --> 1:05:45.651
I promise.

1:05:51.323 --> 1:05:53.659
Everything's cramping. Can you...

1:05:54.951 --> 1:05:58.288
Could you just cut one loose
just for a moment?

1:06:02.626 --> 1:06:04.378
I don't think I should.

1:06:06.380 --> 1:06:09.257
Lukas told you that, didn't he?

1:06:10.467 --> 1:06:13.929
You're... you're a smart boy, Elias.

1:06:14.971 --> 1:06:16.515
You can think for yourself.

1:06:16.598 --> 1:06:19.893
You don't always have to listen
to your brother.

1:06:25.232 --> 1:06:26.733
Elias.

1:06:31.780 --> 1:06:34.074
Oh, thank you. Such a good boy.

1:06:46.002 --> 1:06:48.672
Why did you rip up my drawing?

1:06:53.427 --> 1:06:55.846
I shouldn't have done that.

1:06:55.929 --> 1:06:57.931
That was a mistake.

1:07:00.767 --> 1:07:03.228
Sometimes people just...

1:07:04.980 --> 1:07:07.023
...do things they don't mean.

1:07:08.191 --> 1:07:10.193
I was upset.

1:07:11.403 --> 1:07:13.905
Why were you upset?

1:07:16.408 --> 1:07:18.326
LUKAS:
What are you doing?

1:07:18.410 --> 1:07:20.412
MOTHER:
Elias?

1:07:20.495 --> 1:07:23.039
-You shouldn't be in here.
-She was thirsty.

1:07:23.123 --> 1:07:24.791
I just gave her some water.

1:07:24.875 --> 1:07:26.418
MOTHER:
Elias, listen to me.

1:07:26.501 --> 1:07:28.879
Don't listen to him.

1:07:28.962 --> 1:07:30.255
Listen to me.

1:07:30.338 --> 1:07:31.673
I'm your mother.

1:07:31.757 --> 1:07:34.092
What are you holding in your hand?

1:07:35.135 --> 1:07:37.012
MOTHER:
Please.

1:07:38.013 --> 1:07:40.307
Elias, stay with me.

1:07:43.643 --> 1:07:45.562
Her arms were hurting.

1:07:47.022 --> 1:07:48.565
I was just gonna retie them.

1:07:48.648 --> 1:07:50.484
You were gonna let her go.

1:07:50.567 --> 1:07:52.277
I was just gonna retie it. I swear.

1:07:52.360 --> 1:07:54.279
Stay with me, honey.

1:07:56.740 --> 1:07:58.533
Get the tape.

1:07:58.617 --> 1:08:00.202
ELIAS:
What?

1:08:00.285 --> 1:08:01.787
And a sock.

1:08:04.039 --> 1:08:05.665
Why?

1:08:05.749 --> 1:08:07.542
To keep her from lying.

1:08:08.627 --> 1:08:10.462
Elias.

1:08:26.311 --> 1:08:28.647
What are you doing?

1:08:29.856 --> 1:08:31.191
Elias.

1:08:31.274 --> 1:08:32.901
No, honey.

1:08:32.984 --> 1:08:34.736
My... I'm still healing.

1:08:34.820 --> 1:08:36.238
Please...

1:08:37.280 --> 1:08:39.699
Elias, please don't.

1:09:11.648 --> 1:09:13.650
LUKAS:
You did the right thing.

1:09:18.363 --> 1:09:20.574
Together we're strong, right?

1:09:26.955 --> 1:09:31.001
All right, we got cookies, Goldfish.

1:09:31.084 --> 1:09:33.587
What about Pop-Tarts? You want some?

1:09:34.838 --> 1:09:37.173
Elias, Pop-Tarts?

1:09:41.136 --> 1:09:42.470
Hi.

1:09:42.554 --> 1:09:44.472
Can you open the door, please?

1:09:44.556 --> 1:09:46.349
ELIAS:
What should we do?

1:09:46.433 --> 1:09:49.144
Don't let them in. Are you crazy?

1:09:49.227 --> 1:09:51.271
But they already saw us.

1:09:51.354 --> 1:09:53.398
They saw you.

1:09:53.481 --> 1:09:54.691
Get rid of them.

1:10:02.449 --> 1:10:05.243
Guess what. You're under arrest.

1:10:05.327 --> 1:10:07.203
Just kidding.

1:10:07.287 --> 1:10:08.830
Little cop humor. Sorry.

1:10:08.914 --> 1:10:10.707
Would you mind
grabbing your mother for me?

1:10:10.790 --> 1:10:12.292
:
Help!

1:10:13.335 --> 1:10:14.878
Help!

1:10:18.506 --> 1:10:20.550
She went out.

1:10:20.634 --> 1:10:22.719
You sure? 'Cause her car's in the garage.

1:10:22.802 --> 1:10:25.013
She has more than one car.

1:10:25.096 --> 1:10:27.307
GARY:
Eh? There you go. Says she's not here.

1:10:27.390 --> 1:10:30.226
You want to tell her we came by?

1:10:30.310 --> 1:10:32.604
Where'd you say she was again?

1:10:37.150 --> 1:10:39.819
-Help!

1:10:46.117 --> 1:10:48.161
GARY:
Give the kid a break, okay?

1:10:48.244 --> 1:10:50.038
She probably went into town
for a few minutes.

1:10:50.121 --> 1:10:52.332
Can we just let him speak
for himself, please?

1:10:53.416 --> 1:10:55.418
Do you know where your mom is?

1:10:57.128 --> 1:10:59.130
She went into town.

1:11:02.092 --> 1:11:03.551
SANDY:
You know what, why don't we just

1:11:03.635 --> 1:11:05.220
-give her a quick call, okay?
-Oh, Christ, Sandy.

1:11:05.303 --> 1:11:07.138
It'll only take a second, Gary.
It's not a big deal.

1:11:07.222 --> 1:11:08.390
GARY:
You wanted to check up, we checked up.

1:11:08.473 --> 1:11:10.392
We can come back later.
She's not gonna be happy

1:11:10.475 --> 1:11:12.394
-we're harassing the kid.
-It's already dialing.

1:11:22.988 --> 1:11:24.406
Voice mail.

1:11:24.489 --> 1:11:25.949
Satisfied?

1:11:26.032 --> 1:11:27.409
DISPATCH :
2320.

1:11:27.492 --> 1:11:29.411
2320. Go ahead.

1:11:29.494 --> 1:11:30.829
I'll be back.

1:11:36.960 --> 1:11:40.380
Elias, is there something
you want to tell me?

1:11:42.507 --> 1:11:43.925
You know, I have a kid.

1:11:45.176 --> 1:11:46.636
Little girl.

1:11:46.720 --> 1:11:48.346
She's a lot younger than you.

1:11:48.430 --> 1:11:50.598
Her name's Alma.

1:11:50.682 --> 1:11:53.393
And if, God forbid,
she ever needed help with anything--

1:11:53.476 --> 1:11:55.353
any help at all--

1:11:55.437 --> 1:11:58.148
I would hope she would know
how to ask for it.

1:12:00.567 --> 1:12:02.318
Do you understand what I'm saying?

1:12:09.034 --> 1:12:10.869
You won't get into any trouble.

1:12:10.952 --> 1:12:14.039
Okay, we got an overturned
tractor trailer off Route 7.

1:12:15.749 --> 1:12:17.459
SANDY:
Elias.

1:12:17.542 --> 1:12:19.878
Hey. Let's go.

1:12:30.305 --> 1:12:32.557
Everything's fine.

1:12:32.640 --> 1:12:35.727
Great. I'm going with or without you.

1:12:39.189 --> 1:12:42.317
We'll be back tonight
when your mother comes home.

1:13:39.457 --> 1:13:42.085
You're such a bad liar.

1:13:47.799 --> 1:13:49.801
We're calling an Uber.

1:13:56.474 --> 1:13:58.476
Where are they?

1:14:01.104 --> 1:14:03.273
I forgot my toothbrush.

1:14:05.942 --> 1:14:07.861
-Seriously?
-I'll be quick.

1:14:07.944 --> 1:14:10.238
The car's gonna be here soon.

1:14:10.321 --> 1:14:13.241
I-I'll be right back.
Just-just tell them to wait.

1:15:03.708 --> 1:15:06.502
LUKAS:
You need to let me explain.

1:15:10.340 --> 1:15:12.842
-You lied.
-Elias...

1:15:12.926 --> 1:15:14.844
That's her.

1:15:14.928 --> 1:15:17.347
You have to listen to me.

1:15:18.389 --> 1:15:19.849
Why do you hate her?

1:15:19.933 --> 1:15:21.768
I'll tell you, but you can't let her go.

1:15:21.851 --> 1:15:24.854
Look, you have to trust me, okay?

1:15:24.938 --> 1:15:26.564
-Just let me go!
-Elias, wait!

1:15:31.653 --> 1:15:33.029
I'm just trying to help you!

1:15:34.906 --> 1:15:36.324
Elias, please!

1:15:38.117 --> 1:15:40.036
Don't listen to her!

1:15:40.119 --> 1:15:42.080
-She's gonna hurt you! Stop!

1:15:42.163 --> 1:15:44.582
Elias, please!
She just wants you to be alone!

1:15:46.793 --> 1:15:49.629
Just open this door!

1:15:49.712 --> 1:15:50.838
Elias!

1:15:50.922 --> 1:15:51.923
Open the door!

1:15:54.592 --> 1:15:56.636
Elias, she's just gonna lie to you!

1:15:58.179 --> 1:15:59.806
Elias, please!

1:16:07.897 --> 1:16:09.857
Elias?

1:16:12.068 --> 1:16:13.403
Mommy?

1:16:13.486 --> 1:16:15.947
Oh, baby. Oh, my baby.

1:16:17.782 --> 1:16:19.993
-I'm sorry.
-Oh, it's okay. It's okay.

1:16:20.076 --> 1:16:21.911
I didn't want to do those things to you.

1:16:21.995 --> 1:16:23.913
-No, it's okay. It's okay.
-I'm sorry.

1:16:23.997 --> 1:16:25.665
Oh, sweetie.

1:16:25.748 --> 1:16:27.458
I'm right here. I'm right here.

1:16:27.542 --> 1:16:29.919
-It was Lukas the whole time.
-Shh.

1:16:30.003 --> 1:16:31.879
-He lied.
-No.

1:16:31.963 --> 1:16:33.840
He said you weren't our mom.

1:16:33.923 --> 1:16:36.968
He said I had to hurt you,
but I didn't want to.

1:16:42.140 --> 1:16:44.058
It's okay. It's okay.

1:16:46.811 --> 1:16:49.731
So you're not mad at me?

1:16:49.814 --> 1:16:52.483
No. No, I'm not mad.

1:16:52.567 --> 1:16:54.319
No.

1:16:58.948 --> 1:17:00.783
I'm scared.

1:17:02.952 --> 1:17:05.288
I don't know what's going on.

1:17:07.623 --> 1:17:09.625
Will you talk to Lukas?

1:17:12.378 --> 1:17:14.505
I think something's wrong with him.

1:17:16.758 --> 1:17:20.136
I just want things to be back
to how they were before.

1:17:30.688 --> 1:17:33.191
Sweetie...

1:17:33.274 --> 1:17:35.485
I need you to do something for me.

1:17:40.406 --> 1:17:43.159
I need you to come somewhere with me.

1:17:55.129 --> 1:17:56.464
Lukas?

1:18:08.643 --> 1:18:10.353
Mom?

1:18:10.436 --> 1:18:13.106
I can't find Lukas.

1:18:19.404 --> 1:18:21.489
It's okay, honey.

1:18:27.328 --> 1:18:28.788
Come on.

1:18:28.871 --> 1:18:30.498
Let's go.

1:18:54.480 --> 1:18:56.399
It's okay.

1:18:57.984 --> 1:18:59.986
It's okay. I got you.

1:19:14.750 --> 1:19:16.377
Lukas?

1:19:22.800 --> 1:19:24.552
Come on.

1:20:31.327 --> 1:20:33.663
It's okay, honey. I'm here.

1:21:03.776 --> 1:21:06.112
I need you to look at it, honey.

1:21:08.990 --> 1:21:10.658
It's okay.

1:21:10.741 --> 1:21:12.743
Just tell me what it is.

1:21:14.579 --> 1:21:16.289
-Paint.
-No.

1:21:18.958 --> 1:21:20.876
I need you to think hard, honey.

1:21:23.879 --> 1:21:25.548
-I don't know.
-Yes, you do, Elias.

1:21:25.631 --> 1:21:28.843
You know what it is.
Now, I need you to say it.

1:21:30.678 --> 1:21:32.597
Please. Please, Elias.

1:21:32.680 --> 1:21:34.765
No more pretending.

1:21:34.849 --> 1:21:36.934
I can't... I-I tried,

1:21:37.018 --> 1:21:40.396
but I just couldn't handle watching you

1:21:40.479 --> 1:21:43.357
talking to him all the time
and playing with him. I...

1:21:43.441 --> 1:21:45.651
-Please stop. Stop.
-No.

1:21:45.735 --> 1:21:48.529
Honey, listen to me.

1:21:48.613 --> 1:21:50.906
It wasn't your fault. It was an accident.

1:21:50.990 --> 1:21:53.492
You didn't know the gun was loaded.

1:21:53.576 --> 1:21:56.245
You were just playing.
You didn't mean to hurt him.

1:21:56.329 --> 1:21:57.788
Please stop.

1:21:57.872 --> 1:22:00.374
I know this is hard, but listen to me.

1:22:02.543 --> 1:22:04.337
We can start over.

1:22:04.420 --> 1:22:07.256
-Stop.
-But I need you to see what's real.

1:22:07.340 --> 1:22:09.216
-No.
-Please just...

1:22:14.221 --> 1:22:16.349
This is real.

1:22:18.017 --> 1:22:20.603
And we decided we would split into two.

1:22:22.605 --> 1:22:25.608
That way, we would never
have to be alone again.

1:22:26.984 --> 1:22:28.736
MOTHER:
Look at it.

1:22:28.819 --> 1:22:31.364
-No more pretending.
-No. No, stop.

1:22:32.990 --> 1:22:34.825
LUKAS:
You and me are the same.

1:22:34.909 --> 1:22:37.119
And that's what makes us lucky.

1:22:37.203 --> 1:22:41.082
I can never hurt you,
and you can never hurt me.

1:22:41.165 --> 1:22:45.044
MOTHER:
That line between reality and fantasy,

1:22:45.127 --> 1:22:47.088
it's vanished.

1:22:47.171 --> 1:22:48.422
-This is real.
-Stop.

1:22:48.506 --> 1:22:50.007
-No.

1:22:50.091 --> 1:22:51.676
MOTHER:
No more pretending.

1:22:51.759 --> 1:22:53.010
-Please stop.
-No...

1:22:53.094 --> 1:22:54.804
-No more pretending.
-Stop it!

1:23:20.454 --> 1:23:22.123
Mom?

1:24:02.037 --> 1:24:03.456
Mommy?

1:25:33.879 --> 1:25:35.589
You were... you were just...

1:25:35.673 --> 1:25:37.967
You didn't do anything wrong, baby.

1:25:43.472 --> 1:25:46.892
And you were so strong.

1:25:52.064 --> 1:25:53.774
Aw.
