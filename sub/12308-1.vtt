00:01.071 --> 00:03.213
<i>Previously on</i> Stargate Atlantis...

00:03.293 --> 00:06.256
Colonel Ellis, you made excellent time
on your first voyage here.

00:06.336 --> 00:08.745
The Replicators
know the location of Earth,

00:08.920 --> 00:11.504
and with these new ships,
have the means to get there.

00:11.584 --> 00:14.344
<i>So, you're going to blow up their ships.</i>

00:14.632 --> 00:17.063
Oberoth... We had no
choice but to attack you.

00:17.143 --> 00:19.722
You were building warships,
they needed to be neutralized.

00:19.802 --> 00:21.180
<i>And now so do you.</i>

00:21.260 --> 00:23.309
No matter where we try
to hide on this planet,

00:24.029 --> 00:26.751
<i>the replicator satellite
will be able to track us.</i>

00:26.847 --> 00:27.954
<i>We submerge the City,</i>

00:28.063 --> 00:30.277
the water attenuates,
the satellite's beam intensity

00:30.373 --> 00:32.694
- <i>buys us some more shield time.</i>
- The water has no effect?

00:32.776 --> 00:34.820
It's having an affect, but
not what we want it to.

00:34.900 --> 00:38.032
<i>You want to bring an asteroid
towards us? Is that wise?</i>

00:38.198 --> 00:40.441
Atlantis is leaving this planet.

00:41.132 --> 00:44.246
- We're not flying high enough.
- We don't have enough power.

00:44.487 --> 00:45.498
Lower the shield.

00:50.619 --> 00:51.986
<i>The hyperdrive just shut down.</i>

00:52.068 --> 00:53.025
We are lost.

00:53.121 --> 00:54.851
We dropped outta
hyperspace way too soon.

00:54.931 --> 00:56.960
<i>I have no idea where we are.</i>

01:04.144 --> 01:07.099
She's unresponsive and her pupils
are sluggish. I need you to prep the OR

01:07.179 --> 01:09.020
and have the scanner ready
when we get there.

01:09.131 --> 01:11.226
We're on it. The scanner
is moving into position.

01:12.434 --> 01:13.499
She's crashing.

01:14.381 --> 01:17.013
Let's go, guys. I don't
want to do this in the hall.

01:20.797 --> 01:22.294
Here we go, here we go.

01:24.375 --> 01:25.994
You got City-wide sensors back on-line?

01:26.093 --> 01:28.647
Hopefully, yeah.
Slowly booting up right now.

01:28.787 --> 01:31.085
- Can we contact the Apollo?
- Not yet, no.

01:31.165 --> 01:33.227
- Why not?
- The sub-space communications are down.

01:33.335 --> 01:35.078
Don't worry,
I've got Chuck working on it.

01:37.643 --> 01:39.301
Well, maybe you should be working on it.

01:39.566 --> 01:41.053
I've got bigger fish to fry.

01:41.238 --> 01:43.558
What could be more important
than contacting the Apollo?

01:44.591 --> 01:45.709
This can't be right.

01:45.813 --> 01:46.839
What's wrong?

01:47.625 --> 01:50.437
Power.
We're losing massive amounts of power.

01:50.517 --> 01:51.810
Just pull it out.

01:51.968 --> 01:53.767
- I can't do that.
- Why not?

01:54.187 --> 01:57.168
We have to wait to get you under the
scanner, make sure pulling it out's not

01:57.277 --> 02:01.115
- gonna cause even more damage.
- Pull... it... out.

02:01.258 --> 02:03.425
Yeah, yeah, I get it,
you're a tough guy.

02:03.535 --> 02:06.531
If you want to pull it out, go ahead,
but I'm not gonna... are you crazy?

02:19.529 --> 02:22.007
On three, ready? One, two, three.

02:30.091 --> 02:31.095
Clear.

02:34.103 --> 02:34.943
Charging.

02:35.421 --> 02:37.170
I don't think the problem
is on this end.

02:37.250 --> 02:40.112
I don't care where the problem is,
I want to know what the problem is.

02:41.102 --> 02:42.351
It's in the conduits.

02:43.582 --> 02:44.619
It looks like...

02:45.575 --> 02:48.106
Several main conduits
were affected by the beam.

02:48.276 --> 02:51.354
- All right, that means we'll need to--
<i>- Yes-yes-yes. You should get the--</i>

02:51.475 --> 02:53.268
I will, as soon as
I've shut down all the--

02:53.353 --> 02:55.002
<i>Yes, yes, yes, I will do the same thing.</i>

02:55.199 --> 02:56.879
Wait, wait, wait, what's going on here?

02:56.986 --> 02:59.152
Every second I waste,
we're draining more power.

02:59.263 --> 03:01.183
Just trust me,
we're doing the right thing.

03:01.338 --> 03:02.364
No change.

03:03.575 --> 03:05.904
Let's start her on Manitol, 200 cc's IV.

03:06.641 --> 03:08.160
Tell me what's going on.

03:08.331 --> 03:11.449
Long story short, there are a bunch of
systems on right now don't need to be

03:11.536 --> 03:14.434
and given our current situation they're
draining the life out of the City.

03:14.682 --> 03:17.530
- Can you not just shut them off?
- Yeah, just wait...

03:17.976 --> 03:19.438
Maybe, yeah.

03:23.329 --> 03:24.406
Come on...

03:24.943 --> 03:26.072
Come on...

03:28.648 --> 03:31.047
- Time?
- She's been flat for almost 2 minutes.

03:32.166 --> 03:34.124
Come on, we need you here, Elizabeth.

03:35.568 --> 03:38.066
She's going back into v-fib.
Let's hit her again.

03:41.291 --> 03:42.299
Clear.

03:47.705 --> 03:48.813
There we go.

03:49.229 --> 03:50.891
There we go. Let's start the scan.

03:57.269 --> 03:58.327
Dr. Keller?

04:00.330 --> 04:01.409
That's not good.

04:01.781 --> 04:03.410
Her brain is swelling quite seriously.

04:03.525 --> 04:06.609
- Would explain the sluggish pupils.
- Yeah, among other things.

04:06.721 --> 04:08.940
Give her Nimodipine,
30 milligrams q 4 h,

04:09.093 --> 04:11.362
and keep an eye on her blood pressure.

04:12.951 --> 04:15.624
Nothing. The control grid's
all out of whack.

04:15.704 --> 04:18.129
I can't shut the systems down from here.
We're bleeding out.

04:18.259 --> 04:21.158
- We shut down the systems manually.
- I don't think we have the time.

04:21.273 --> 04:22.730
You would rather not try?

04:23.164 --> 04:25.384
Okay, you're right, you're right.

04:25.673 --> 04:27.469
Zelenka, we need to deploy some teams.

04:30.253 --> 04:31.380
She's not responding.

04:34.098 --> 04:35.168
We're losing her.

04:39.619 --> 04:42.195
I'm sending some of my men
with your guys in case they need help.

04:42.307 --> 04:44.747
Their ETA is under 5 minutes.
Does that give us enough time?

04:44.887 --> 04:47.993
I don't know, what little power
we had left is almost gone.

04:48.081 --> 04:50.446
We'll be lucky if we make it
through the night.

06:08.122 --> 06:09.815
- Listen.
- What?

06:10.015 --> 06:13.004
You've been making a lot of decisions
without consulting me.

06:13.139 --> 06:15.661
I'm sorry, we're a little under
the gun here. Things move fast.

06:15.741 --> 06:18.115
I understand that, but with Elizabeth...

06:18.739 --> 06:21.413
incapacitated. I hate to say it, but...

06:22.237 --> 06:25.170
- You're in charge. I know, I'm sorry.
- Just keep me in the loop.

06:25.851 --> 06:26.782
Okay.

06:26.903 --> 06:29.420
- Okay, I'll give you the <i>Coles notes</i>.
- The what?

06:29.784 --> 06:30.940
The <i>Cliff notes</i> ?

06:31.035 --> 06:33.681
- Why didn't you just say that?
- Look, never mind. Look.

06:33.761 --> 06:37.307
as we were leaving Lantia we got grazed
by the replicator's satellite beam.

06:37.657 --> 06:40.052
It impacted the side of the tower,
and from what we can tell,

06:40.157 --> 06:42.048
it wreaked havoc
on a number of power conduits.

06:42.161 --> 06:43.528
So? Re-route the power then.

06:43.697 --> 06:45.013
Yeah, it's not so easy.

06:45.192 --> 06:47.511
Look, the ZPM room
is at the base of the tower,

06:47.632 --> 06:51.022
which means the conduits in and around
where the beam hit are primary conduits,

06:51.156 --> 06:53.224
they can't be routed around.

06:53.871 --> 06:57.775
- So parts of the City don't have power?
- No, no. The conduits weren't severed,

06:57.941 --> 07:01.498
they were damaged. Look,
it's complicated, but imagine them as...

07:01.922 --> 07:03.610
- Leaky pipes, okay?
- Okay.

07:03.694 --> 07:05.528
You pump water through them, they leak.

07:05.617 --> 07:07.736
You dumb this down any more,
you're going to get hit.

07:07.824 --> 07:08.685
Sorry.

07:08.776 --> 07:11.154
Look, the City realizes
that, for whatever reason,

07:11.244 --> 07:12.988
power's not making it
to the outer piers,

07:13.076 --> 07:14.653
so, instead of repairing the leaks,

07:14.739 --> 07:17.355
which it can't do,
it increases the ZPM's output

07:17.446 --> 07:20.345
so that even though the pipes
are leaky and we lose power,

07:20.556 --> 07:22.435
enough energy makes it
to the end of the line.

07:23.220 --> 07:24.897
- And that's bad?
- No, that's good.

07:25.427 --> 07:28.692
Well, otherwise, we'd lose the shields.
We'd lose atmosphere. we'd all be dead.

07:28.967 --> 07:30.718
There are a number
of systems on right now

07:30.799 --> 07:32.970
that don't need to be,
and they're screaming for power.

07:33.052 --> 07:35.637
We're gonna lose juice, potentially
fatal, no matter what we do,

07:35.751 --> 07:38.539
but if we can get those
nonessential systems shut down,

07:38.620 --> 07:41.430
then the ZPM will need to pump
less power through the leaky pipes,

07:41.510 --> 07:44.953
and we'll be able to put off
imminent death for another hour or so.

07:46.300 --> 07:47.961
So, then where are we at?

07:48.041 --> 07:49.917
Well, the teams are making good time.

07:50.602 --> 07:54.281
We've got about 60% of the nonessential
systems shut down, so--

07:54.793 --> 07:56.205
What? What's happening?

07:57.066 --> 07:58.865
The City's outer buildings
are decompressing

07:58.946 --> 08:00.926
and shutting down
their artificial gravity.

08:01.007 --> 08:02.591
Why would the City do such a thing?

08:06.434 --> 08:08.639
It'll collapse the shield.
It's trying to save power.

08:08.769 --> 08:10.126
We've got guys out there.

08:10.607 --> 08:12.625
<i>Matthews, fall back
to the tower immediately.</i>

08:12.732 --> 08:13.974
I don't think we're done, Sir.

08:14.054 --> 08:15.906
The City's shield's collapsing. Move.

08:16.166 --> 08:17.755
You heard the man. Go, go!

08:22.786 --> 08:24.234
They're not going to make it.

08:24.681 --> 08:27.719
- Stop it. Stop it from doing this.
- The City doesn't think it can maintain

08:27.815 --> 08:29.378
the shield unless we make it smaller.

08:29.473 --> 08:31.510
If we delay its collapse,
it could fail completely.

08:31.624 --> 08:32.878
I don't care. Override it.

08:33.402 --> 08:34.650
It's not letting me.

08:54.360 --> 08:55.430
We're almost there.

08:57.736 --> 08:59.074
We're losing those guys!

08:59.259 --> 09:01.159
You think I don't realize that?

09:02.658 --> 09:04.031
The gravity just shut down!

09:23.644 --> 09:25.405
Tell the other teams to hurry.

09:25.515 --> 09:28.608
I don't want them out there
any longer than they need to be.

10:24.550 --> 10:26.978
Hey, are you getting the same
data rate inconsistencies

10:27.060 --> 10:28.402
off these flash drives?

10:30.021 --> 10:31.021
Bill?

10:36.182 --> 10:37.230
Oh, sorry.

10:38.205 --> 10:39.299
Oh, boy.

10:39.541 --> 10:42.690
- It's this damn weightlessness.
- Maybe you should gate back to Earth.

10:42.772 --> 10:45.164
I can get somebody else
to help me bring the station on-line.

10:45.255 --> 10:47.140
No. I'll be fine, as soon as I can...

10:47.864 --> 10:49.768
figure out
how to get the gravity back on.

10:50.858 --> 10:52.664
What were you saying
about the flash drives?

10:52.828 --> 10:56.085
Yeah, it's just that every time
I update the software, the drives--

10:57.853 --> 10:59.686
the Pegasus Gate just activated.

11:00.086 --> 11:02.860
This is colonel Abe Ellis,
commander of the Apollo.

11:02.941 --> 11:04.658
Midway Station, please respond.

11:04.922 --> 11:07.443
Colonel Ellis, this is
colonel Samantha Carter.

11:07.524 --> 11:09.348
I am on the Midway Station.

11:09.778 --> 11:11.018
<i>How did the mission go?</i>

11:11.390 --> 11:12.659
As far as we can tell,

11:12.740 --> 11:15.344
Atlantis successfully evaded
the replicator's beam

11:15.425 --> 11:17.254
and was able to enter hyperspace.

11:17.440 --> 11:18.713
<i>From what you can tell?</i>

11:18.877 --> 11:21.425
<i>Well, they're not at
the predetermined rendezvous point.</i>

11:21.670 --> 11:22.671
<i>Really?</i>

11:22.796 --> 11:24.745
<i>They should have beaten you there.</i>

11:25.252 --> 11:27.238
<i>Actually, hey, how are you dialing us?</i>

11:27.318 --> 11:29.878
<i>M12-578 doesn't have a Gate.
It's off the grid.</i>

11:29.959 --> 11:32.936
I jumped to the nearest Gate
to see if they've checked in with you.

11:33.446 --> 11:35.506
Well, I'm sorry to say
that they haven't.

11:35.704 --> 11:37.028
<i>That's probably not good.</i>

11:37.274 --> 11:38.503
No, probably not.

11:39.972 --> 11:43.468
I'll head back, dial you again
in an hour, sooner if I hear from them.

11:43.548 --> 11:45.254
<i>- Sounds good.</i>
- Apollo out.

11:55.345 --> 11:57.252
Hey, you should be in bed.

12:03.011 --> 12:06.386
- How's she doing?
- Her brain... is... swelling,

12:07.582 --> 12:08.629
drastically,

12:09.899 --> 12:11.404
more than her head can handle.

12:11.645 --> 12:15.604
If it doesn't stop, they're gonna have
to perform a decompressive craniectomy.

12:16.072 --> 12:19.494
Basically, they cut out
a piece of her skull,

12:19.665 --> 12:21.465
and the brain is allowed to...

12:21.921 --> 12:24.029
expand outside of her head.

12:32.460 --> 12:33.793
Any word on how she's doing?

12:33.874 --> 12:36.169
She's still in the OR. No real news yet.

12:36.249 --> 12:39.228
Listen, I think we should collapse
the shield right to the tower.

12:39.409 --> 12:41.444
That will leave us
completely exposed to space.

12:41.525 --> 12:44.467
Yes, it will, but our power is spread
so thin right now,

12:44.548 --> 12:47.254
I don't have any extra juice
to come up with the solutions

12:47.336 --> 12:50.218
to the 100 or so problems that could
lead to our premature demise today.

12:50.309 --> 12:53.126
Check with Zelenka. Make sure all
the science teams are accounted for.

12:53.207 --> 12:54.580
Already done, we're ready.

12:54.663 --> 12:55.719
All right.

12:56.837 --> 12:59.261
- Do what you need to do.
- Okay, here we go.

13:11.187 --> 13:13.760
The calcium channel blockers
aren't having much effect.

13:15.046 --> 13:17.163
- What's her intracranial pressure?
- 35.

13:19.507 --> 13:21.033
I can't let her get to 40.

13:23.915 --> 13:24.917
Okay...

13:26.303 --> 13:28.826
Let's prep for a decompressive
craniectomy.

14:12.021 --> 14:13.221
Pressure down to 29.

14:13.408 --> 14:15.122
Hopefully, we'll get it under 25.

14:20.480 --> 14:21.480
Yeah...

14:21.702 --> 14:24.479
All right, two bits of good news.

14:24.595 --> 14:27.286
One, I've been able
to calculate our exact location.

14:27.495 --> 14:29.821
- Does that mean we can use the Gate?
- Sadly, no.

14:29.910 --> 14:31.820
To activate the Gate,
we require that we stay

14:31.910 --> 14:33.707
within a fairly small area of space.

14:33.787 --> 14:35.384
We're moving too fast to use it.

14:35.515 --> 14:37.138
Can we use the sub-lights to slow down?

14:37.258 --> 14:40.311
It would be great if they were working,
but sub-light and navigation are out.

14:40.722 --> 14:42.741
You decided to put this
in the good news category?

14:42.849 --> 14:44.759
Well, at least we're not
lost anymore, right?

14:44.849 --> 14:48.032
Number two, there is nothing wrong
with our hyperdrives.

14:48.451 --> 14:50.531
Then why did we fall out of hyperspace
prematurely?

14:50.611 --> 14:51.894
The damaged power conduits.

14:51.976 --> 14:53.889
We had plenty of gas in the tank,
so to speak,

14:53.985 --> 14:55.652
can't get it to the engine. Stalled out.

14:55.747 --> 14:58.148
So if we repair the conduits,
can we jump back into hyperspace?

14:58.260 --> 15:01.279
That's the idea. We wouldn't be able
to repair them completely, not without

15:01.390 --> 15:04.626
landing and shutting down and such,
but we can definitely patch them up.

15:04.706 --> 15:07.431
Look, Zelenka and his team are working
as fast as they possibly can,

15:07.614 --> 15:09.589
but we're still leaking a lot of power.

15:09.766 --> 15:12.080
- Even with all our reductions?
- I'm afraid so, yes.

15:12.986 --> 15:13.986
Look,

15:14.320 --> 15:16.073
this is the minimum amount of power

15:16.206 --> 15:18.722
the City requires to execute
a jump into hyperspace.

15:18.856 --> 15:20.957
If we don't fix the power conduits
inside of an hour,

15:21.077 --> 15:22.477
we'll drop below that level.

15:22.640 --> 15:23.840
After that, we're stuck.

15:24.207 --> 15:26.202
We'll have maybe 30 hours
before the shields fail,

15:26.332 --> 15:28.238
and we all die in the vacuum of space.

15:38.956 --> 15:41.018
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

15:41.141 --> 15:42.491
They got all the glass out.

15:42.717 --> 15:45.053
- Good.
- You need me somewhere?

15:45.145 --> 15:46.395
Right here getting better.

15:46.516 --> 15:48.116
All right, well, I'm good to go.

15:49.446 --> 15:50.446
Colonel...

15:58.018 --> 15:59.018
She okay?

15:59.331 --> 16:00.627
She's alive, but...

16:01.211 --> 16:02.389
she's in bad shape.

16:03.892 --> 16:05.192
She's got six broken ribs,

16:05.518 --> 16:07.018
one of which punctured a lung.

16:08.832 --> 16:11.516
Amazingly, she doesn't have
any spinal damage, but...

16:12.272 --> 16:14.365
her head got knocked around pretty good.

16:15.832 --> 16:17.957
She's suffering from cerebral oedema,

16:18.081 --> 16:20.765
which may have caused
substantial brain damage.

16:22.830 --> 16:24.102
What does all that mean?

16:25.393 --> 16:28.140
Well, it's too early
to know for sure, but...

16:29.207 --> 16:30.463
If she survives,

16:31.394 --> 16:32.861
and I got to stress the "if"...

16:35.331 --> 16:37.381
She'll never be
the same Elizabeth again.

16:42.268 --> 16:43.268
I'm sorry.

16:45.973 --> 16:48.455
I've got to get some things
and get back in there.

16:48.707 --> 16:51.583
We're understaffed.
Most of our team's on the Apollo.

17:01.383 --> 17:04.165
- How's it going on this end?
- Actually, you know, remarkably well.

17:04.258 --> 17:05.619
- Really?
- Yes, yes, yes.

17:05.709 --> 17:08.521
Cannibalizing parts and crystals
from secondary conduits

17:08.635 --> 17:10.838
and interfacing them
with the primary ones is...

17:11.424 --> 17:13.799
Is going very smoothly.
Yes, if we keep our current pace,

17:13.961 --> 17:16.205
we should be done
well before we drop below

17:16.305 --> 17:20.055
the necessary power requirements to jump
into hyperspace and meet the Apollo.

17:20.269 --> 17:21.890
Well, that's fantastic.

17:22.200 --> 17:23.787
Yes. Yeah, I thought you'd be happy.

17:23.888 --> 17:26.753
Happy? There's actually a chance we
might make it through this thing. I'm

17:26.866 --> 17:29.648
- ecstatic. I'm gonna do a little--
<i>- Colonel Sheppard, Dr. Mckay,</i>

17:29.760 --> 17:32.027
<i>please report
to the control room immediately!</i>

17:33.538 --> 17:35.321
That lasted what, like, a second?

17:39.915 --> 17:41.765
You're going to want to look at this.

17:43.229 --> 17:45.272
- What is that?
- An asteroid belt?

17:46.040 --> 17:47.740
Are the sub-lights still off-line?

17:47.868 --> 17:48.868
Yup.

17:48.987 --> 17:50.605
We're gonna need to expand the shields.

17:50.687 --> 17:51.999
We don't have enough power.

17:52.109 --> 17:54.500
How long till we get there,
how long till we get through it?

17:54.623 --> 17:56.197
About 10 minutes until we get there.

17:56.285 --> 17:58.077
After that,
maybe 2 minutes to get through.

17:58.159 --> 17:59.930
2 minutes to get through
an asteroid field?

18:00.037 --> 18:03.435
We're not passing all the way through.
We're just going to skim the edge.

18:03.517 --> 18:06.196
- You can't gimme 2 minutes of shields?
- Don't take it personaly.

18:06.305 --> 18:09.025
I'd like them up as much as you would,
but we can't afford the power.

18:09.134 --> 18:12.406
Zelenka needs 45 minutes to complete
the repairs to the power conduits.

18:12.495 --> 18:14.412
If we raise the shields
even for one minute,

18:14.509 --> 18:16.280
it'll eat up all his time.
We can't do it.

18:18.535 --> 18:19.539
How big are they?

18:19.636 --> 18:21.957
We're in the middle
of a pretty big solar system right now,

18:22.068 --> 18:26.187
and the asteroid belt's probably made up
of remnants of early failed planets, so,

18:26.720 --> 18:27.720
you know...

18:28.037 --> 18:29.281
Building-size and larger.

18:30.243 --> 18:33.379
I could get in the Chair, fire drones,
and clear a path to travel through.

18:33.580 --> 18:36.094
Good idea, but the Chair room's
outside of the shield right now,

18:36.190 --> 18:38.617
and we'd never get to it.
Look we could...

18:39.284 --> 18:41.435
No, that's not going to work.
We could...

18:42.657 --> 18:44.812
How many people on the base
have the ancient gene?

18:44.968 --> 18:48.435
20 or so. Look, no, no.
No, no, no, that is a bad idea--

18:48.586 --> 18:50.253
- You have a better idea?
- Yes.

18:52.311 --> 18:54.102
I can. I just-- I need some time.
If you...

18:54.198 --> 18:56.329
Contact everyone on the base
who has the ancient gene,

18:56.469 --> 18:58.602
tell them to meet me
up at the jumper bay.

18:59.808 --> 19:00.941
Well, do it.

19:03.695 --> 19:07.162
Which means we can't raise the shields
because we don't have enough power.

19:07.428 --> 19:09.489
If we don't clear a path for the City,

19:09.609 --> 19:11.750
it'll get ripped apart. So,

19:12.325 --> 19:14.658
we're going to take
every last jumper we have,

19:14.799 --> 19:17.199
and we're going to clear a path
through the belt

19:17.547 --> 19:19.049
by firing our drones.

19:21.161 --> 19:24.131
Excuse me. I've really only flown
a jumper twice,

19:24.243 --> 19:26.265
and I've never actually fired
a live drone,

19:26.345 --> 19:28.308
- so--
- You've done it in simulations, right?

19:28.955 --> 19:31.501
- Well, yeah, but--
- It's basically the same thing.

19:31.634 --> 19:33.992
If McKay can do it, you can do it.

19:34.236 --> 19:36.301
- Yes, about that, actually, I--
- Look,

19:37.288 --> 19:38.690
I know it's dangerous.

19:38.925 --> 19:42.357
I know a lot of you haven't logged a lot
of hours in these things, but right now,

19:43.236 --> 19:45.576
it's the only viable option
we have, or...

19:46.797 --> 19:47.661
Or die.

19:50.580 --> 19:51.840
Let's get moving.

20:12.270 --> 20:14.605
<i>All right, I've loaded
a flight formation for all of you.</i>

20:14.890 --> 20:18.198
Stay in your designated positions,
take out anything that's in your path.

20:18.329 --> 20:21.278
<i>You've got a full load of drones,
so ammo shouldn't be a problem.</i>

20:22.703 --> 20:24.817
Looks like the old video game,
Asteroids.

20:24.907 --> 20:26.167
Whatever works for you.

20:26.280 --> 20:27.766
I was terrible at Asteroids.

20:27.889 --> 20:29.495
I think I actually scored zero once.

20:29.939 --> 20:32.367
Then there's only
one way to go, and that's up.

20:32.855 --> 20:34.221
All right, everyone.

20:34.628 --> 20:35.695
<i>Let's go.</i>

20:35.973 --> 20:37.503
<i>Open the jumper bay doors.</i>

20:55.903 --> 20:57.795
Come on, guys, stay in formation.

20:58.745 --> 21:00.244
We can't afford any gaps.

21:03.494 --> 21:04.891
Yeah, there you go. See?

21:05.025 --> 21:06.036
<i>Not so hard.</i>

21:10.519 --> 21:12.069
Jumpers, you should be in range

21:12.270 --> 21:13.270
in three...

21:14.459 --> 21:15.459
Two...

21:16.771 --> 21:18.210
- One.
- Fire at will.

21:29.947 --> 21:31.098
Nice shooting, people.

21:31.567 --> 21:34.268
Too many of them coming in too fast.
We're not going to get them all.

21:34.701 --> 21:36.103
Double up, fire four a-piece.

21:36.616 --> 21:38.438
I can't control four drones
at the same time.

21:38.773 --> 21:39.982
Just concentrate.

21:49.340 --> 21:51.019
- <i>Dammit!</i>
- Don't worry about it.

21:51.174 --> 21:53.630
You were right. We can't get everything
on the first pass.

22:05.273 --> 22:07.509
Have they destroyed enough asteroids
to clear a path?

22:07.769 --> 22:08.969
We're about to find out.

22:14.148 --> 22:15.822
- Well, now what?
- Well, on my mark,

22:15.918 --> 22:18.897
you, Bolton, and Levine are gonna break
formation and head back to the City.

22:18.993 --> 22:20.478
Take out anything that we missed.

22:20.595 --> 22:22.729
Oh, that sounds important.
maybe someone else should--

22:22.866 --> 22:23.899
Break!

22:32.948 --> 22:34.995
<i>- You've a big one on your left.</i>
- I see it.

22:35.075 --> 22:36.705
Impact in 10 seconds.

22:53.194 --> 22:54.264
What was that?

22:54.587 --> 22:56.137
Smaller pieces getting through.

22:59.930 --> 23:01.480
Some of them evidently not so small.

23:02.127 --> 23:04.733
Right now damage is confined
to the outer edge of the City.

23:05.908 --> 23:07.530
Let's hope it stays that way.

23:13.522 --> 23:15.130
All right, we're through.

23:15.251 --> 23:17.329
Now we're gonna double back,
pick up any stragglers.

23:38.095 --> 23:39.095
That's it.

23:40.137 --> 23:41.215
We made it.

23:57.298 --> 23:59.476
I can't believe that actually worked.
That was amazing.

23:59.584 --> 24:00.480
You did good.

24:00.591 --> 24:03.194
Zelenka and his team should
have the conduits repaired now, so...

24:03.327 --> 24:06.294
- Think we're finally out of the woods.
<i>- Colonel Sheppard, Dr. Mckay,</i>

24:06.716 --> 24:09.049
<i>please report
to the control room immediately.</i>

24:09.650 --> 24:10.650
Come on!

24:15.206 --> 24:16.368
What the hell happened?

24:16.450 --> 24:18.766
- The hyperdrive is offline.
- I thought it was good to go.

24:18.899 --> 24:21.351
It was, but a few large pieces
of rock impacted the City,

24:21.431 --> 24:23.061
and one control array was damaged.

24:23.777 --> 24:27.241
- We can't jump until we fix it.
- I told you I was no good at Asteroids.

24:36.753 --> 24:39.020
The damaged conduits
are on the outer edge of the City,

24:39.155 --> 24:42.046
which, sadly, is outside
of the protection of the shield.

24:42.157 --> 24:44.091
We can use the transporters
to get us very close,

24:44.201 --> 24:46.233
but it will still require a space walk.

24:46.367 --> 24:48.231
- That shouldn't be too bad.
- It'll be a breeze,

24:48.348 --> 24:50.323
with the exception
of the micro-asteroids.

24:50.403 --> 24:52.590
- The what?
- We just came through an asteroid belt.

24:52.701 --> 24:54.799
The big stuff's behind us,
but there's a bunch of

24:54.932 --> 24:56.636
little bullet-sized rocks out there.

24:56.747 --> 24:58.901
Tiny rock bullets. Great.

24:59.012 --> 25:01.170
- I'm sure you'll be fine.
- Then why aren't you going?

25:01.265 --> 25:03.055
You've worked out
the details of the repair.

25:03.151 --> 25:05.139
It will be a waste of time
getting me up to speed.

25:05.221 --> 25:06.809
Speaking of time, how much do we have?

25:06.921 --> 25:08.874
Well, once you're suited up...
15 minutes?

25:08.970 --> 25:09.776
That's it?

25:09.872 --> 25:11.719
Hey, if the patch-job
we did on the conduits

25:11.808 --> 25:13.349
hadn't slowed down the power loss,

25:13.461 --> 25:15.172
we'd have hit the deadline already.

25:19.600 --> 25:20.689
You can do this.

25:23.538 --> 25:24.538
Right.

25:32.732 --> 25:34.617
Mckay! I've been trying to reach you.

25:34.751 --> 25:37.370
Well, trying to save the City
and whatnot. Look, how's Elizabeth?

25:37.450 --> 25:40.189
I want to talk to you. She's really bad.
In fact, she's so far gone,

25:40.300 --> 25:42.448
I don't think there's anything
we can do to heal her.

25:42.770 --> 25:45.003
Oh, my God. Are you sure?

25:45.083 --> 25:48.173
I've exhausted every medical
possibility, and none of it's worked.

25:49.366 --> 25:51.259
- She... She's going to die?
- Well, I do

25:51.339 --> 25:53.428
have one more idea,
but I need your help.

25:53.869 --> 25:55.180
Me? What do you need me for?

25:57.000 --> 25:58.000
See those?

25:58.178 --> 25:59.255
What are they?

25:59.514 --> 26:01.998
Remember when Dr. Weir
was attacked by that Replicator,

26:02.109 --> 26:03.879
- and he infected her--
- Nanites.

26:04.713 --> 26:07.734
Carson was able to render them inert
using an electro-magnetic pulse.

26:08.037 --> 26:09.503
But they're still in her system.

26:10.122 --> 26:11.411
You're a genius.

26:12.100 --> 26:14.991
Well, you know,
trying to save a life and whatnot.

26:18.460 --> 26:19.663
<i>You wanna what?</i>

26:19.833 --> 26:21.561
Reactivate Weir's nanites.

26:21.673 --> 26:22.784
<i>That is a terrible,</i>

26:23.288 --> 26:24.595
<i>terrible idea.</i>

26:24.806 --> 26:26.920
What? I'd reprogram them.

26:27.000 --> 26:29.219
- <i>No.</i>
- <i>John, we are losing her here.</i>

26:29.314 --> 26:30.807
Keller's team has done everything.

26:30.918 --> 26:33.308
If I can reprogram the nanites
to help repair her body

26:33.390 --> 26:36.262
- without triying to take over her br--
- <i>That's a big "if", isn't it?</i>

26:37.202 --> 26:40.767
I'm fairly confident I can reprogram
them to do only what we want.

26:41.073 --> 26:42.695
<i>"Fairly confident"?</i>

26:43.041 --> 26:44.372
<i>What if they come back online</i>

26:44.505 --> 26:46.527
<i>and start communicating
with the other Replicators?</i>

26:46.642 --> 26:50.509
<i>The last thing we need right now
is a bunch of robot warships showing up.</i>

26:50.642 --> 26:53.238
Are you listening?
Look, I said I can reprogram them

26:53.649 --> 26:54.915
<i>to be completely harmless.</i>

26:55.026 --> 26:58.159
<i>I am not having this conversation
until you're sure.</i>

26:59.987 --> 27:03.055
<i>I want to save Elizabeth
as much as anyone,</i>

27:04.805 --> 27:08.002
<i>but she wouldn't want us
risking the City, not even for her.</i>

27:19.236 --> 27:21.014
<i>That was the right call, by the way.</i>

27:21.898 --> 27:23.431
<i>Yeah, let's hope so.</i>

27:32.193 --> 27:33.660
Any word from the Apollo?

27:33.860 --> 27:34.916
No, not yet.

27:38.975 --> 27:40.428
What you working on?

27:40.583 --> 27:43.997
I'm actually trying to figure out a way
to find or contact Atlantis.

27:44.454 --> 27:47.067
Well... They've obviously
veered off course, right?

27:47.178 --> 27:49.772
Like, when was the last time
Atlantis' hyperdrives were used?

27:49.867 --> 27:51.118
Like, a million years ago?

27:51.220 --> 27:53.699
Who knows what that kind
of inactivity could have done to them.

27:53.839 --> 27:57.306
I think it's more likely that they
jumped out of hyperspace too soon.

27:57.417 --> 27:59.104
They were only flying with one ZPM.

27:59.214 --> 28:01.639
Maybe McKay under-estimated
the power requirements.

28:01.879 --> 28:02.904
Mckay?

28:03.916 --> 28:05.477
Either way, I know how to find them.

28:05.829 --> 28:06.978
- Really?
- Yeah,

28:07.058 --> 28:09.573
we do an AGB, an all gates bulletin.

28:09.669 --> 28:11.801
It's like an all points bulletin,
only with Stargates.

28:11.910 --> 28:13.483
- Oh, come on.
- No, no, really.

28:13.578 --> 28:16.736
We'll create a program, we'll dial all
the Gates in the Pegasus Galaxy at once,

28:16.832 --> 28:19.333
and try to establish
radio contact with Atlantis.

28:19.428 --> 28:21.159
But the Atlantis Gate is off the grid.

28:21.519 --> 28:23.787
Right, but if they're close
to another Gate--

28:23.867 --> 28:25.830
Then they would have
contacted us by now.

28:27.960 --> 28:28.971
Yeah.

28:30.352 --> 28:32.853
So... what have you come up with then?

28:32.989 --> 28:35.791
- Well, nothing yet, but--
- Well, at least I am trying.

28:35.901 --> 28:38.343
I'm generating ideas here. I just...

28:38.976 --> 28:40.011
Sorry.

28:43.511 --> 28:45.206
<i>I'm actually surprised.</i>

28:45.616 --> 28:48.705
<i>The damage in this area
seems to be quite minimal.</i>

28:51.247 --> 28:52.778
<i>I beg to differ.</i>

28:55.033 --> 28:56.113
<i>Oh, my...</i>

29:14.457 --> 29:15.755
<i>Let me guess...</i>

29:16.589 --> 29:18.462
<i>The array is over there.</i>

29:19.940 --> 29:21.348
<i>I'm afraid so.</i>

29:25.093 --> 29:26.227
<i>Great.</i>

29:35.395 --> 29:37.035
<i>What the hell was that?</i>

29:37.500 --> 29:38.894
<i>Micro-asteroid.</i>

29:39.742 --> 29:40.780
<i>Right...</i>

29:42.648 --> 29:43.714
<i>All right.</i>

29:44.260 --> 29:46.242
<i>Looks like we're going to have to jump.</i>

29:46.352 --> 29:49.741
- <i>But I can't jump 100 feet.</i>
- <i>We're in space, remember?</i>

29:49.850 --> 29:51.687
<i>It's not that far a distance.</i>

29:52.478 --> 29:55.951
<i>Look, I'm gonna hook you up
with this tether.</i>

29:56.265 --> 29:57.332
<i>Okay?</i>

29:59.785 --> 30:02.700
<i>Then I'm gonna demagnetize your boots.</i>

30:06.020 --> 30:07.810
- <i>Then I'm gonna throw you.</i>
- <i>Wait, what?</i>

30:07.906 --> 30:10.216
<i>Then I'm gonna demag my boots</i>

30:10.298 --> 30:12.197
<i>before the tether catches.</i>

30:12.443 --> 30:15.922
<i>Your inertia should pull both of us
over the hole and onto the hallway.</i>

30:16.654 --> 30:19.467
- <i>It'll be a cinch.</i>
- <i>But what if you miss?</i>

30:19.547 --> 30:21.655
<i>You're just gonna have to trust me, Doc.</i>

30:21.777 --> 30:24.320
<i>Trust me as far
as I can throw you, actually.</i>

30:24.990 --> 30:27.382
- <i>Very funny.</i>
- <i>All right, let's do this.</i>

31:09.255 --> 31:11.715
<i>That was... was unbelievable.</i>

31:11.893 --> 31:13.273
<i>Let's get to work.</i>

31:13.533 --> 31:14.653
<i>All right.</i>

31:23.004 --> 31:24.275
How's it going?

31:25.396 --> 31:26.496
Slowly.

31:27.132 --> 31:29.264
Have you found a way
to reactivate the nanites safely?

31:29.373 --> 31:31.683
Short story, yes. Long story, no.

31:32.872 --> 31:34.265
- What?
- I'm 100% certain

31:34.361 --> 31:36.589
that I can reactivate the nanites
and have them help

31:36.685 --> 31:38.379
put Elizabeth back together.

31:39.380 --> 31:41.840
- Okay...
- The problem is, that they would do it

31:41.950 --> 31:44.970
by replacing her damaged cells
with replicated nanites,

31:45.066 --> 31:47.335
which mean the moment
I tell them to turn inert again--

31:47.444 --> 31:49.557
those cells would stop functioning,
and she'd die.

31:49.637 --> 31:50.683
Yeah.

31:51.080 --> 31:53.827
Good news, I've been able to
program in a way they wouldn't harm her,

31:53.923 --> 31:55.112
I'm sure of that.

31:55.194 --> 31:58.501
Plus, I've shut down their ability
to contact the Replicators via subspace,

31:58.610 --> 32:00.920
so both she and we would be safe,

32:01.015 --> 32:02.069
but...

32:02.436 --> 32:04.951
she'd be part Replicator
for the rest of her life.

32:05.142 --> 32:07.220
Yeah, Sheppard's not gonna go for that.

32:08.336 --> 32:10.124
There's a slight possibility
I might be able

32:10.220 --> 32:12.311
to make them help repair
her organic cells,

32:12.407 --> 32:14.489
and then shut down
when they're done, but...

32:14.574 --> 32:15.791
I'm gonna need more time.

32:17.658 --> 32:20.378
Okay, well, I'll leave you to it then.
Good luck.

32:20.473 --> 32:21.799
Thanks.

32:25.203 --> 32:27.635
<i>I'm sorry.
It's taking longer than I expected.</i>

32:27.745 --> 32:30.273
<i>These gloves are making the work
so much slower.</i>

32:35.510 --> 32:37.014
<i>Don't worry about it.</i>

32:38.271 --> 32:40.758
<i>We've still got four minutes
before the energy dips too low</i>

32:40.854 --> 32:43.736
- <i>and we can't make the jump.</i>
- <i>So, no pressure then.</i>

33:16.604 --> 33:18.613
Listen, they...

33:20.075 --> 33:21.961
They say you can't hear me,

33:23.286 --> 33:25.500
but I just... I just wanted to...

33:31.583 --> 33:33.646
I just wanted to thank you.

33:36.298 --> 33:37.965
Thanks for letting me...

33:38.061 --> 33:40.276
stay here a couple of years ago.

33:43.789 --> 33:46.918
Because I don't know
if I would still be...

33:55.036 --> 33:56.526
Thank you, Dr. Weir.

34:01.816 --> 34:03.701
- What did I do?
- Nothing, it wasn't you,

34:03.825 --> 34:05.369
but you need to leave.

34:05.779 --> 34:07.529
Hang another bag of Manitol.

34:13.241 --> 34:15.661
<i>You've been hit by a micro-asteroid.
Does it hurt?</i>

34:16.289 --> 34:18.873
- <i>It doesn't.</i>
- <i>You're in shock.</i>

34:20.333 --> 34:22.085
- <i>There's a hole in my suit.</i>
- <i>It's okay.</i>

34:22.194 --> 34:25.254
<i>I've dialed up controls to create
positive pressure. I'm calling a Jumper.</i>

34:25.333 --> 34:27.511
- <i>I've got to get you to the OR.</i>
- <i>We can't leave yet.</i>

34:27.620 --> 34:29.842
- <i>I have to finish the repairs.</i>
- <i>Tell me what to do.</i>

34:30.163 --> 34:32.089
<i>It's too complicated.</i>

34:33.469 --> 34:34.597
<i>I'm almost finished.</i>

34:36.217 --> 34:38.760
<i>Please, help me turn around.</i>

34:43.128 --> 34:45.440
- <i>Dr. Mckay?</i>
- What is it, Keller?

34:45.521 --> 34:48.527
Elizabeth is crashing. If we're gonna do
this thing, we need to do it now.

34:48.869 --> 34:51.079
- I need more time.
- <i>We don't have more time.</i>

34:51.175 --> 34:52.692
I can't keep her blood pressure up,

34:52.788 --> 34:56.327
and if her ICP continues to climb,
there's no bringing her back.

34:59.045 --> 35:01.341
Okay, I'm transferring
the program to you now.

35:03.029 --> 35:03.834
I'm on my way.

35:08.590 --> 35:11.966
You know, the easiest thing to do if
they did fall out of hyperspace early

35:12.089 --> 35:15.424
is to fly back over the path
between M12-578 and Atlantis.

35:15.520 --> 35:18.599
Well, that'd take over a million years.
That's why we have hyperspace.

35:18.679 --> 35:20.643
We could use the Apollo's
long-range sensors.

35:20.931 --> 35:23.604
Those long-range sensors,
they don't work in hyperspace.

35:23.684 --> 35:25.654
But we could
make a little jump, look around,

35:25.737 --> 35:28.211
make another little jump,
look around... until we find them.

35:28.307 --> 35:29.427
Yeah, that's good.

35:29.550 --> 35:31.599
So using those sensors,

35:31.695 --> 35:33.281
and conservatively,

35:33.390 --> 35:35.110
we'd have to make...

35:35.548 --> 35:38.063
180,000 little jumps.

35:38.418 --> 35:40.120
It'd take a few years.

35:40.200 --> 35:43.499
Unless they seriously augment
the long-range sensors.

35:43.747 --> 35:45.020
Oh, who's going to do that?

35:45.129 --> 35:47.253
It's not like they have
an Asgard on board.

35:48.012 --> 35:50.798
Feel like taking a little trip
to the Pegasus Galaxy?

35:53.047 --> 35:54.722
<i>Just some final adjustments.</i>

35:54.872 --> 35:57.551
<i>You're doing a great job, Radek.
I've called a Jumper.</i>

36:01.931 --> 36:02.997
<i>There.</i>

36:03.489 --> 36:04.774
<i>I'm done.</i>

36:07.343 --> 36:09.448
Control room, this is Sheppard.

36:09.544 --> 36:13.112
<i>As soon as we get inside the shield,
activate the hyperspace jump.</i>

36:13.556 --> 36:15.893
- I'm sorry, John, but we can't.
- <i>Why not?</i>

36:15.989 --> 36:18.886
- <i>Zelenka just finished repairs.</i>
- Yes, I know,

36:18.982 --> 36:21.060
but we've just dropped below the line.

36:21.689 --> 36:23.594
We don't have enough power.

36:37.796 --> 36:39.477
- Is he going to be okay?
- I think so.

36:39.586 --> 36:41.829
- It didn't hit any major arteries.
- Lucky.

36:42.325 --> 36:45.082
I wouldn't say that. He's still
stuck here just like the rest of us.

36:45.673 --> 36:46.751
So it's true.

36:47.145 --> 36:48.476
Finally fixed the hyperdrive,

36:48.575 --> 36:50.923
now we don't have enough juice
to go anywhere.

36:51.032 --> 36:52.965
We've only got 28 hours
before the shields fail.

36:53.045 --> 36:55.676
- So, what's the plan?
- I don't know, I got to find McKay.

36:55.936 --> 36:57.720
- He's in there.
- What?

36:59.435 --> 37:00.446
Hey!

37:02.510 --> 37:04.683
I heard we didn't get the array
fixed in time.

37:04.806 --> 37:07.376
- What were you doing in there?
- Look,

37:07.526 --> 37:08.773
she was dying, okay?

37:09.937 --> 37:12.193
Look, her heart was weak,
her nervous system was fried.

37:12.273 --> 37:13.444
What did you do?

37:17.640 --> 37:19.485
- I reactivated the nanites.
- Damn it, McKay!

37:19.581 --> 37:21.953
Look, you were busy!
It was life or death. If I didn't act--

37:22.033 --> 37:23.537
Yes, she would have died, I know!

37:23.617 --> 37:26.666
I know what you're thinking, but helping
Elizabeth is not putting us at risk.

37:26.917 --> 37:29.627
You just reactivated
the replicator nanites.

37:29.707 --> 37:30.902
They're harmless.

37:30.998 --> 37:34.127
I am 100% certain they're not gonna try
to take her over, or contact the others!

37:34.209 --> 37:36.175
No, no, you can't know that for sure.

37:36.255 --> 37:38.097
Yes. Yes, I can.

37:39.697 --> 37:40.680
Shut it down.

37:41.665 --> 37:43.557
But... That would kill her.

37:43.759 --> 37:45.726
What would she want?
Do you think she'd want this?

37:45.806 --> 37:47.937
Yes. She'd sure as hell
do the same for you.

37:48.017 --> 37:49.664
Then you obviously didn't know her well.

37:49.908 --> 37:52.733
Maybe not, but you know what,
give it time, you can ask her herself--

37:52.813 --> 37:53.721
No!

37:53.831 --> 37:56.237
It's too dangerous.
Shut it down right now.

37:57.637 --> 37:58.906
No. No, I'm not going to.

38:05.373 --> 38:06.603
Meyers...

38:07.314 --> 38:09.296
Bring an EMP generator to the OR.

38:09.446 --> 38:11.043
Would you please just listen to me?

38:11.305 --> 38:12.712
Dr. Keller!

38:27.433 --> 38:28.772
What's going on?

38:45.312 --> 38:47.389
The quarantine is unnecessary.

38:47.485 --> 38:51.557
Well, you'll excuse me if I wait
for a second opinion.

38:51.667 --> 38:53.061
Okay, this is stupid.

38:53.853 --> 38:55.521
- What is?
- Us fighting.

38:55.630 --> 38:58.674
Look, I know you're not happy with me,
and you may have some cause.

38:58.754 --> 39:01.469
Anyway, it's not gonna matter
if we don't figure a way outta this.

39:02.427 --> 39:04.518
Look, we have to work together, so...

39:06.431 --> 39:08.864
So, so I'm... I'm sorry.

39:14.003 --> 39:15.149
Apology accepted.

39:16.545 --> 39:17.666
All right.

39:19.483 --> 39:22.271
- Well, someone should talk to her.
- Well, Teyla's in there.

39:23.542 --> 39:24.635
All right.

39:32.316 --> 39:33.918
They shouldn't have done this.

39:34.749 --> 39:37.004
<i>None of us wanted to lose you,
Elizabeth.</i>

39:38.221 --> 39:41.342
And what happens if the nanites are
able to contact the other Replicators?

39:41.542 --> 39:43.344
<i>Rodney does not believe
that is possible.</i>

39:45.047 --> 39:46.305
No, it's reckless.

39:47.357 --> 39:48.696
<i>In my opinion...</i>

39:49.298 --> 39:51.185
<i>It is well worth the risk.</i>

39:56.746 --> 40:00.163
You have no idea
what I went through the last time.

40:01.242 --> 40:02.445
Believe me...

40:03.777 --> 40:05.861
This is a very bad idea.

40:21.169 --> 40:23.109
What the hell are you doing up here?

40:23.205 --> 40:26.731
Well, there's not much point sitting in
the infirmary waiting to die, is there?

40:27.674 --> 40:29.723
All right, where do we stand?

40:29.847 --> 40:31.800
We can forget about
subspace communications.

40:31.882 --> 40:34.604
The main control array was
almost completely damaged by the beam.

40:35.518 --> 40:37.760
I do, however, have another idea.

40:37.904 --> 40:38.907
Let's hear it.

40:39.017 --> 40:41.032
The reason why we cannot use
the power we have left

40:41.114 --> 40:44.155
to execute a short jump into hyperspace
is that the City will not let us.

40:45.528 --> 40:48.576
It's a safety protocol,
but I might be able to bypass it.

40:48.656 --> 40:49.869
What does that give us?

40:49.949 --> 40:51.051
Not much.

40:51.486 --> 40:53.264
We wouldn't be able
to get to the Apollo,

40:53.360 --> 40:55.291
or be able to get
to the nearest Stargate, but

40:55.371 --> 40:58.663
we might be able to find
a habitable planet within range.

40:59.164 --> 41:00.921
I have my team running
sensor sweeps now.

41:01.001 --> 41:02.909
He's conveniently leaving out
the reason why

41:03.004 --> 41:05.587
those safety protocols
are in place in the first place.

41:06.338 --> 41:09.680
Yes, with insufficient power, there is
a chance that the City could be ripped

41:09.760 --> 41:11.901
apart as we try
to enter the hyperspace window.

41:12.010 --> 41:13.184
What kind of chance?

41:14.511 --> 41:15.394
50-50.

41:16.506 --> 41:19.486
Well, I got to tell you, Radek,
I'm not loving that idea.

41:22.616 --> 41:23.983
Experimental Jumper.

41:25.738 --> 41:28.185
Remember I was zapped
by a machine a few months ago, I got...

41:28.280 --> 41:30.358
Well, even smarter than I normally am?

41:30.475 --> 41:32.102
The one that almost killed you? Yeah.

41:32.197 --> 41:33.933
Before I was reset, I was very close

41:34.028 --> 41:35.789
to giving one of our Jumpers
a hyperdrive.

41:35.869 --> 41:37.554
- Can you finish it?
- Yeah.

41:37.681 --> 41:39.543
Yes, I probably can.

41:39.623 --> 41:42.587
All right, great. We'll make a jump
to the Apollo, tell them where we are.

41:42.710 --> 41:44.035
- No.
- Why no?

41:44.391 --> 41:47.176
Jumper's hyperdrive'd be limited.
We wouldn't be able to jump that far.

41:47.256 --> 41:48.601
How far then?

41:50.323 --> 41:51.847
What do you think, like, two?

41:52.318 --> 41:54.601
Yeah. Two and change maybe?

41:54.696 --> 41:57.498
Conservatively, maybe 2000 light years.

41:58.113 --> 42:00.341
This is a list of addresses
that are within range.

42:03.230 --> 42:05.819
Right, we'll make trips and
ferry the crew to one of the planets.

42:05.899 --> 42:06.946
Again, no.

42:07.274 --> 42:09.240
- Why not?
- Well, the drive's never been tested.

42:09.320 --> 42:11.290
Yeah, we'd be lucky if we get two jumps.

42:11.385 --> 42:13.504
We'll make a return trip somewhere.

42:16.827 --> 42:19.285
Yeah, ideally, somewhere
with a few ZPMs to spare.

42:19.381 --> 42:21.554
We come back,
we get Atlantis fully powered.

42:21.636 --> 42:23.212
Yeah, that'd be great.

42:23.563 --> 42:25.297
M7R-227.

42:27.117 --> 42:28.320
What's that?

42:29.140 --> 42:30.261
Well...

42:30.670 --> 42:32.429
There's a planet out there with ZPMs?

42:32.586 --> 42:33.598
Yeah...

42:33.922 --> 42:35.516
Yeah, we know they have a few ZPMs.

42:35.686 --> 42:36.934
And who would that be?

42:38.843 --> 42:39.922
That?

42:40.032 --> 42:42.218
That would be the Replicator homeworld.

42:43.722 --> 42:45.609
You feel up to a heist?

00:00.500 --> 00:02.000
