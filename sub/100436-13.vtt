WEBVTT

00:04.569 --> 00:06.658
- And those of you
patrolling 7th avenue,

00:06.702 --> 00:08.486
please be aware of the new
pedal pubs.

00:08.530 --> 00:10.053
They're bike-powered
mobile bars

00:10.097 --> 00:11.837
that are very popular
with bachelorette parties.

00:11.881 --> 00:14.666
But unfortunately they have
led to a dramatic increase

00:14.710 --> 00:17.669
in the rarely seen case
of female public urination.

00:17.713 --> 00:19.149
- Resist.
- That's everything,

00:19.193 --> 00:21.543
but before we go home,
but quick reminder that today

00:21.586 --> 00:24.154
is Sergeant Santiago's last day
before maternity leave.

00:25.199 --> 00:26.678
We'll see you
in three months.

00:26.722 --> 00:28.811
- She gets three months off?
Can I take a maternity leave?

00:28.854 --> 00:30.508
- Are you giving birth
to a baby?

00:30.552 --> 00:31.727
- I'm having a seven pound mass

00:31.770 --> 00:33.468
removed from my abdomen
next week.

00:34.556 --> 00:35.470
- Yeah, never ask
Scully questions.

00:35.513 --> 00:36.471
That's on me, guys!

00:36.514 --> 00:37.515
- Dismissed.

00:39.648 --> 00:42.564
- So, have you guys decided
on a name yet?

00:42.607 --> 00:44.392
- We're not telling people
until he's born.

00:44.435 --> 00:46.176
- Not the baby's name--my name.
What's he gonna call me?

00:46.220 --> 00:49.092
Uncle Chuck? Unky C? Ooh--
Chee-Chee, so he says it early?

00:49.136 --> 00:50.354
- Maybe just Charles.

00:50.398 --> 00:52.095
- Wait, so my dad gets to be
his "Pop-Pop,"

00:52.139 --> 00:53.357
but I'm just "Charles?"

00:53.401 --> 00:55.098
- Your dad does not get
to be his "Pop-Pop."

00:55.142 --> 00:57.579
- Well I hope you're prepared
to make that phone call.

00:58.884 --> 01:00.538
- Uh, what was that?

01:00.582 --> 01:02.888
- Wow, all of Brooklyn
lost power.

01:02.932 --> 01:04.716
- You know, I've always
kind of liked blackouts.

01:04.760 --> 01:06.849
Listen to how quiet it is.
It's so peaceful.

01:09.286 --> 01:10.809
Nope, it immediately
turned into a purge.

01:10.853 --> 01:12.550
Way to go, New York.
All right, let's suit up!

01:32.614 --> 01:34.181
- Maybe it's not so bad
out there.

01:34.224 --> 01:35.443
I mean, none of our phone
are ringing.

01:35.486 --> 01:36.835
- That's because all
the cell towers are down.

01:36.879 --> 01:38.707
Nobody has landlines anymore,
so they can't call in.

01:38.750 --> 01:40.578
- Huh, really makes you think
about society's reliance

01:40.622 --> 01:42.232
on modern technology,
doesn't it?

01:42.276 --> 01:43.451
- No.
- Yeah, me neither.

01:43.494 --> 01:44.582
I just thought maybe
that's how you see it.

01:44.626 --> 01:46.541
- Guys, stop wasting time.
Headlamps on!

01:46.584 --> 01:48.238
- We have to engage
in blackout protocol.

01:48.282 --> 01:50.501
- I'm surprised, those guys are
really springing into action.

01:50.545 --> 01:51.894
Nope, they're just eating all
the food in the fridge

01:51.937 --> 01:53.417
before it goes bad.

01:53.461 --> 01:54.766
- There's a dozen sandwiches
here, I don't know what kind.

01:54.810 --> 01:56.594
- I'll figure it out later.
Just start chewing.

01:56.638 --> 01:57.639
- Yeah, they suck.

01:57.682 --> 01:59.293
- So, only
Captain Holt or Terry

01:59.336 --> 02:01.251
can initiate
actual blackout protocol,

02:01.295 --> 02:02.600
but I don't see
them anywhere.

02:02.644 --> 02:05.255
- Guys?
Where did our dads go?

02:05.299 --> 02:07.257
- Hello? Anyone?

02:07.301 --> 02:09.346
We're stuck in the elevator!

02:09.390 --> 02:10.652
- Can't you yell any louder?

02:10.695 --> 02:12.523
Use those big strong lungs
you're always flexing.

02:12.567 --> 02:13.742
- These are my pecs.

02:13.785 --> 02:15.178
- So this is all just
for show then.

02:15.222 --> 02:16.484
It has no functional purpose.

02:16.527 --> 02:18.181
- I mean, I am pretty strong.

02:18.225 --> 02:19.530
- Good, then rip
those doors open.

02:20.662 --> 02:22.359
- I can't do that.
- Oh, well at least you haven't

02:22.403 --> 02:24.448
dedicated a significant
portion of your life

02:24.492 --> 02:25.536
to looking like this.

02:25.580 --> 02:27.669
- What is with you?
- I'm sorry.

02:27.712 --> 02:30.715
This is a nightmare of mine.

02:30.759 --> 02:32.804
I have a phobia of elevators.

02:32.848 --> 02:35.633
It stems from a traumatic
experience I had as a child.

02:35.677 --> 02:38.288
- They only perform
rated-load testing

02:38.332 --> 02:41.509
on city elevators
every five years?

02:42.423 --> 02:43.946
Oh, my.

02:43.989 --> 02:46.992
That was the last time I read
the municipal code before bed.

02:47.036 --> 02:48.690
But...

02:48.733 --> 02:50.082
the damage was done.

02:50.126 --> 02:51.954
- Wait, look at this, sir.
I think we'll be fine.

02:51.997 --> 02:53.695
It was inspected
four months ago.

02:53.738 --> 02:56.654
By Walter Beverly,
the clown prince

02:56.698 --> 02:58.003
of the
Department of Buildings.

02:58.047 --> 02:59.962
You've made it so much worse.
Help!

03:00.005 --> 03:01.572
Help!

03:01.616 --> 03:02.921
- Yeah, they're trapped
in there.

03:02.965 --> 03:04.488
- Oh no, that means
we have to call

03:04.532 --> 03:05.968
the fire department.

03:06.011 --> 03:08.666
- Or, hear me out,
we leave them in there forever,

03:08.710 --> 03:09.711
and move on emotionally.

03:09.754 --> 03:11.843
- No.
Call the fire department.

03:11.887 --> 03:13.497
All right,
as the highest ranking officer

03:13.541 --> 03:14.846
not trapped in a box,
I'll take charge.

03:14.890 --> 03:16.239
- Uh, shouldn't you
be taking it easy?

03:16.283 --> 03:18.285
Your shift's over.
You're on maternity leave.

03:18.328 --> 03:20.591
As the baby's Chee-Chee--
- Charles, I'm fine,

03:20.635 --> 03:21.897
and this is an emergency.

03:21.940 --> 03:23.464
Subways aren't running,
and we're gonna have

03:23.507 --> 03:24.508
a lot of people on the street.

03:24.552 --> 03:25.596
So I'm gonna call
Mounted Division

03:25.640 --> 03:26.815
to help with crowd control.

03:26.858 --> 03:28.295
- But that's
Sergeant Peanut Butter's unit.

03:28.338 --> 03:30.340
No one wants to work with that
condescending dick.

03:30.384 --> 03:32.037
- Okay, first of all,
he's a horse,

03:32.081 --> 03:33.648
so he can't be condescending.

03:33.691 --> 03:35.606
- Ugh, oh-ho, he's got you
people fooled.

03:35.650 --> 03:37.478
- Secondly...

03:37.521 --> 03:39.523
He's a lieutenant now.
- What?! How?!

03:39.567 --> 03:41.351
- Charles, get it together.
I want you and Jake

03:41.395 --> 03:42.570
to go to
the Gowanus power substation.

03:42.613 --> 03:43.962
That's where
the transformer exploded.

03:44.006 --> 03:45.747
Work with ESU,
get us a timetable

03:45.790 --> 03:47.314
for the power being restored,
and hurry!

03:47.357 --> 03:49.054
- Wow, look at my pregnant wife
taking charge.

03:49.098 --> 03:50.882
I don't know whether
to be proud or turned on.

03:50.926 --> 03:52.928
- I said hurry.
- Oh, my God, it's both.

03:54.669 --> 03:55.800
Hey, what happened?

03:55.844 --> 03:57.367
- Someone lost control
of their car,

03:57.411 --> 03:58.542
jumped the curb,
went through the fence,

03:58.586 --> 03:59.935
and rammed
into the transformer.

03:59.978 --> 04:01.719
Guy must have been drunk.
There was an empty bottle

04:01.763 --> 04:02.938
of vodka on the floor
of the car.

04:02.981 --> 04:04.505
- Okay, Charles,
I see two possibilities.

04:04.548 --> 04:05.984
One, he was vaporized
into a being

04:06.028 --> 04:07.899
of pure electricity,
becoming a supervillian

04:07.943 --> 04:09.379
known only as
"The Surge Freak."

04:09.423 --> 04:11.033
- Seems unlikely.
- Yeah, I know, Officer Rick,

04:11.076 --> 04:12.643
that's why I said there were
two possibilities.

04:12.687 --> 04:14.863
He probably just hobbled off
so he wouldn't get a DUI.

04:14.906 --> 04:17.605
Here, we'll follow this very
obvious trail of blood.

04:17.648 --> 04:18.693
Happy now?

04:18.736 --> 04:20.434
Stupid Officer Rick
and his stupid

04:20.477 --> 04:22.436
joyless approach to life.
Come on.

04:25.352 --> 04:26.918
- I can't see anything.
- Me neither.

04:26.962 --> 04:28.703
We'll just have to rely
on our other senses.

04:28.746 --> 04:30.008
- I call smell.

04:30.052 --> 04:31.923
- Okay, really jumped
on that one.

04:31.967 --> 04:33.403
I wasn't gonna fight you
for smell.

04:33.447 --> 04:34.752
I figured we'd just
listen for sounds.

04:34.796 --> 04:36.841
- Pfft, good luck with that.

04:36.885 --> 04:39.409
Hmm.

04:39.453 --> 04:41.672
Yeah.

04:41.716 --> 04:44.936
Mm-hmm.

04:44.980 --> 04:46.764
- Okay.
- How's it going over there?

04:46.808 --> 04:48.157
You hearing anything?

04:48.200 --> 04:49.811
- Yeah, I'm hearing you
and your creepy sniffs.

04:49.854 --> 04:52.030
- Really? Well I'm smelling
a lot of jealousy

04:52.074 --> 04:53.510
coming from your direction.

04:53.554 --> 04:54.772
- Sound to the left.
- Smell to the left.

04:56.557 --> 04:57.906
- NYPD, hands up!

04:57.949 --> 05:01.039
Oh, yeah, we got him.

05:01.083 --> 05:02.389
- Charles.

05:02.432 --> 05:04.086
- Aw, this ice cream
is melting.

05:04.129 --> 05:06.349
- Who cares?
We can drink melted ice cream.

05:06.393 --> 05:07.568
We can't eat spoiled ham.

05:07.611 --> 05:08.830
We have to prioritize!

05:08.873 --> 05:10.353
- What if we combine them?

05:10.397 --> 05:12.442
Wrap the ice cream
in the ham like a taquito.

05:12.486 --> 05:15.619
- This man.
This man is my best friend.

05:15.663 --> 05:18.100
- You two are the worst people
to have around in an emergency.

05:18.143 --> 05:19.449
I literally can't
imagine a scenario

05:19.493 --> 05:20.755
where you'd be helpful.

05:20.798 --> 05:22.757
- Murder at a Cinnabon.
Who would you call?

05:22.800 --> 05:24.672
- Someone who wouldn't
be distracted by the frosting.

05:24.715 --> 05:26.456
- Yeah, I do love
that frosting.

05:26.500 --> 05:28.371
- Hey Diaz, heard you guys
needed help

05:28.415 --> 05:30.025
from some real heroes.
- Please.

05:30.068 --> 05:32.680
- Firefighters are basically
just EMTs who all live together

05:32.723 --> 05:34.377
and sleep in bunk beds.
- Correction.

05:34.421 --> 05:35.900
It's a professional,
multi-tiered,

05:35.944 --> 05:37.162
shared sleeping set-up.

05:37.206 --> 05:38.468
- You're describing bunk beds.

05:38.512 --> 05:39.643
Just get the people
out of the elevator.

05:39.687 --> 05:41.602
- We should have all ambulances
on call.

05:41.645 --> 05:43.517
I want an open line
of communication with DOT,

05:43.560 --> 05:45.083
and I want someone
from the DA down here

05:45.127 --> 05:46.563
so we don't get cases
thrown out.

05:46.607 --> 05:48.478
I need a pair of sweatpants,
and check again

05:48.522 --> 05:49.914
on that status update from ESU.

05:49.958 --> 05:52.090
All right, go go go!

05:52.134 --> 05:53.570
- What do you need
the sweatpants for?

05:53.614 --> 05:55.485
- My water just broke,
which reminds me,

05:55.529 --> 05:56.660
we should be prepared
to distribute

05:56.704 --> 05:57.748
emergency water and food.

05:57.792 --> 05:59.359
- Your water just broke?!

06:02.057 --> 06:04.102
- We need to go to a hospital
right now.

06:04.146 --> 06:05.277
I don't want a burst happening
around me.

06:05.321 --> 06:06.366
It's way too gross.

06:06.409 --> 06:07.410
- I'm nowhere near
giving birth.

06:07.454 --> 06:08.672
I haven't even lost
my mucus plug.

06:08.716 --> 06:10.370
- Amy, you need to get
the  out of here.

06:10.413 --> 06:12.937
- I'm sorry my baby
grosses you out, Rosa.

06:12.981 --> 06:14.635
- I'm excited to meet your baby
when it's clean

06:14.678 --> 06:16.201
and wearing clothes,
and not blasting out of you

06:16.245 --> 06:17.899
like some half-Cuban
Jimmy Neutron.

06:17.942 --> 06:19.466
- I'm just at the start
of my labor.

06:19.509 --> 06:20.467
I haven't even had my first

06:20.510 --> 06:25.646
contrac--

06:25.689 --> 06:27.343
--tion.
- Was that a contraction?

06:27.387 --> 06:28.649
- No.

06:28.692 --> 06:30.477
That was just a crazy yawn.

06:30.520 --> 06:32.348
Fine, look--
I don't have to go

06:32.392 --> 06:33.567
to the hospital
until my contractions

06:33.610 --> 06:35.003
are three minutes apart
and last

06:35.046 --> 06:36.526
for at least 45 seconds.

06:36.570 --> 06:38.354
- Yeah, but don't you need to
go home and pack some stuff?

06:38.398 --> 06:39.921
I'll be fine.

06:39.964 --> 06:42.271
Scully, you have a hospital
go-bag at your desk, right?

06:42.314 --> 06:45.013
- Yep, what do you need?
One-day, three-day, coma kit?

06:45.056 --> 06:46.667
- I rest my case.

06:46.710 --> 06:48.277
- Peralta, you there?
- Yeah, what's up?

06:48.320 --> 06:49.278
- You gotta get back here
right now.

06:49.321 --> 06:50.279
Amy's water broke.

06:50.322 --> 06:51.280
- What?
- What?

06:51.323 --> 06:52.934
- When?
- When?

06:52.977 --> 06:54.326
- Did she lose her mucus plug?
- Did she lose her mucus plug?

06:54.370 --> 06:55.502
- I can't believe you're
making me say this, but

06:55.545 --> 06:57.939
she thinks she lost
her mucus plug yesterday,

06:57.982 --> 06:59.593
but mistook it
for normal discharge.

06:59.636 --> 07:01.551
- How thick was it?
Was it clear or milky?

07:01.595 --> 07:03.335
- Was it bloody?
Was it "the bloody show?"

07:03.379 --> 07:05.163
- Jake, I think it's very cool
that you've learned this,

07:05.207 --> 07:06.513
very progressive.
Charles, I think you know

07:06.556 --> 07:07.514
you crossed a line.

07:07.557 --> 07:08.950
Just get back here, now!

07:08.993 --> 07:10.255
- Copy.
- This is it.

07:10.299 --> 07:11.605
My purpose is clear.

07:11.648 --> 07:13.128
I was put on this Earth

07:13.171 --> 07:15.260
to get you back in time
to see your baby's birth.

07:15.304 --> 07:18.263
- I mean, you're a grown man
with your own hopes and dreams.

07:18.307 --> 07:21.484
- My purpose is clear.

07:21.528 --> 07:23.312
- Okay.
- Excuse me,

07:23.355 --> 07:25.662
my apartment is
on the seventh floor,

07:25.706 --> 07:28.056
and the elevator
isn't working.

07:28.099 --> 07:29.449
I'm getting cold.

07:29.492 --> 07:31.059
- Well, we're headed back
to our precinct.

07:31.102 --> 07:32.713
There's emergency power
if you want to wait there

07:32.756 --> 07:34.236
for the lights
to come back on.

07:34.279 --> 07:35.542
- I'll get in back.

07:35.585 --> 07:38.980
- I'm Dorothy, but my friends
call me Dotty.

07:39.023 --> 07:42.549
Although these days there
are fewer and fewer of them.

07:42.592 --> 07:43.941
- Charles?
Uh, this is great, Dotty,

07:43.985 --> 07:45.377
but we're kind of in a hurry.

07:45.421 --> 07:46.683
My wife just went into labor
and I want to get there

07:46.727 --> 07:48.250
in time for the birth.
- Why?

07:48.293 --> 07:50.513
The only man in the room
should be the doctor.

07:50.557 --> 07:52.472
- Okay.
- All the dad needs to do

07:52.515 --> 07:54.952
is to make the money
and have a nice, thick belt

07:54.996 --> 07:56.954
for when it's time to teach
him a lesson.

07:56.998 --> 07:58.739
- My dad hit me with a belt.

07:58.782 --> 08:00.305
Soon as I got big enough,

08:00.349 --> 08:01.437
I shot him.

08:01.481 --> 08:03.570
- Wow, what a fun group
for this,

08:03.613 --> 08:05.485
the most important day
of my life.

08:08.618 --> 08:11.099
- Don't worry,
fire department's on the job.

08:11.142 --> 08:13.275
- Hear that, Jeffords?
We're gonna die in here.

08:13.318 --> 08:15.146
We're marked for death!

08:15.190 --> 08:17.105
- Okay, calm down,
I have an idea.

08:17.148 --> 08:19.281
When my parents would fight
and my dad got scary,

08:19.324 --> 08:21.196
I would take
my little brother upstairs

08:21.239 --> 08:22.545
and to distract him,

08:22.589 --> 08:24.329
I'd teach him dance moves.

08:25.766 --> 08:27.202
- What kind of dance moves?

08:27.245 --> 08:28.464
- Mostly '80s hip-hop.

08:28.508 --> 08:29.683
He loved Salt-N-Pepa.

08:29.726 --> 08:31.249
- No, I won't be doing that.

08:34.644 --> 08:37.125
Salt and pepper,
you say?

08:37.168 --> 08:40.345
- Ugh, we haven't moved.
Why is there so much traffic?

08:40.389 --> 08:43.305
Stupid Uber, New York used to
be a paradise of open road.

08:43.348 --> 08:46.264
- Try the siren again.

08:46.308 --> 08:49.311
- In my day,
people respected police.

08:49.354 --> 08:51.313
- They respect us;
they just have nowhere to go.

08:51.356 --> 08:54.055
- God knows they won't go back
to their own country.

08:54.098 --> 08:55.317
- Dotty, I really wish you
weren't such a big part

08:55.360 --> 08:57.145
of my son's birth story.
- We should walk.

08:57.188 --> 08:59.103
It's only 27 blocks,
it's gotta be faster than this.

09:03.194 --> 09:04.631
I mean,
it's a little bit faster.

09:04.674 --> 09:07.198
- Is it? Hey, Dotty,
just weighing our options here.

09:07.242 --> 09:09.070
Have you ever been worn
like a backpack?

09:09.113 --> 09:11.289
- Okay, okay, you take the perp
back to the precinct.

09:11.333 --> 09:12.769
I'll stay here with her,
- Are you sure?

09:12.813 --> 09:14.205
- Just remember
to tell your son

09:14.249 --> 09:16.338
what Chee-Chee
did here tonight.

09:16.381 --> 09:17.469
- How you feeling
about Chee-Chee

09:17.513 --> 09:18.601
having said it out loud
a few times?

09:18.645 --> 09:19.776
- I am loving it!

09:19.820 --> 09:21.430
- Help, help!

09:21.473 --> 09:22.823
- Jake, we don't have time.
We'll call it in.

09:22.866 --> 09:24.172
Let someone else handle it.

09:24.215 --> 09:25.652
- No, we can't ignore
a cry for help.

09:25.695 --> 09:27.175
We can handcuff him
to the railing

09:27.218 --> 09:28.524
Dotty, call out
if you need anything.

09:28.568 --> 09:30.526
- I'd feel safer
if you just shot him.

09:30.570 --> 09:31.614
- Dotty, no.

09:31.658 --> 09:33.529
We're not gonna shoot him!

09:33.573 --> 09:35.444
- Hey, what's the update
from OEM

09:35.487 --> 09:36.663
about the power
coming back on?

09:36.706 --> 09:37.707
- Yeah, they're working on it.
So, listen,

09:37.751 --> 09:39.056
I've been timing
your contractions.

09:39.100 --> 09:40.275
- What?
How?

09:40.318 --> 09:41.842
I've been hiding them so well.

09:41.885 --> 09:43.234
- No, you have not.

09:43.278 --> 09:44.758
- There's too much
radio chatter.

09:44.801 --> 09:47.369
Let's try to keep non-emergency
communications down to a--

09:50.633 --> 09:51.678
minimum.

09:51.721 --> 09:53.244
- They're happening
every five minutes

09:53.288 --> 09:55.116
and they're lasting 20 seconds.
Your baby's coming.

09:55.159 --> 09:56.639
- It's still not active labor.

09:56.683 --> 09:58.598
Don't worry!
I'm not gonna have the baby

09:58.641 --> 10:00.469
here and get placenta
all over your desk

10:00.512 --> 10:01.862
or whatever it is
that you're afraid of.

10:01.905 --> 10:03.733
- Wait, is placenta something
that can get all over?

10:03.777 --> 10:05.213
- Actually, technically--

10:05.256 --> 10:06.649
- You know what, don't answer
that, I don't wanna know.

10:06.693 --> 10:09.696
- I promise I will go
to the hospital as soon as--

10:11.480 --> 10:13.264
- Amy, just make the noise.
You're not fooling anybody.

10:19.619 --> 10:20.707
- NYPD, you called for help?

10:20.750 --> 10:22.578
- Yes, my neighbor fell
down the stairs.

10:22.622 --> 10:24.145
I think he hit his head
real bad.

10:24.188 --> 10:26.495
- Ah. It's a concussion,
for sure.

10:26.538 --> 10:27.714
- All right, we'll bring him
with us to the precinct.

10:27.757 --> 10:29.063
Someone can help him there.

10:29.106 --> 10:30.368
- That'll slow us down.
- Yeah, but we should

10:30.412 --> 10:32.240
still make it as long as
nothing else goes wrong.

10:33.589 --> 10:35.112
- Oh, fun.
Loud gunshots.

10:35.156 --> 10:36.723
- What happened?
- She shot me!

10:36.766 --> 10:38.202
She shot me in the leg.

10:38.246 --> 10:40.465
- You made a sudden motion.
- I sneezed!

10:40.509 --> 10:42.642
- Okay, Dotty,
what do you have a gun for?

10:42.685 --> 10:44.731
- To protect myself.

10:44.774 --> 10:46.733
- Cops are all wimps now.

10:46.776 --> 10:49.213
My wife is having a baby

10:49.257 --> 10:52.434
and I have to be there
to brush her hair.

10:52.477 --> 10:54.262
- I wasn't gonna
brush her hair.

10:54.305 --> 10:55.611
- You weren't?

10:55.655 --> 10:57.526
- All right, look,
Dotty, you're under arrest.

10:57.569 --> 10:59.571
- Jake, we gotta go.
- I can't walk on this leg.

10:59.615 --> 11:01.138
- Great, then we're stuck here.

11:01.182 --> 11:03.271
We're never gonna make
it back to the precinct.

11:03.314 --> 11:05.273
- Yeah we are.
I have an idea.

11:06.753 --> 11:10.539
- Pedal Pub coming through!
- I'm on my way, Amy!

11:18.765 --> 11:20.723
- Thanks for letting us hijack
your bachelorette party.

11:20.767 --> 11:22.203
- Oh, it's what we do.

11:22.246 --> 11:23.900
We're, like, so random.

11:23.944 --> 11:25.859
- Yeah, in Red Bank,
where we're from,

11:25.902 --> 11:28.818
everyone's like,
"Uh-oh, here comes trouble."

11:28.862 --> 11:30.211
- Wait, we have to stop.

11:30.254 --> 11:31.865
- No, no, no--no stopping.
Why are we stopping?

11:31.908 --> 11:33.736
- I lost both my shoes
back there.

11:33.780 --> 11:36.696
I gotta go find them.

11:37.348 --> 11:38.828
Update.

11:38.872 --> 11:40.612
I still have one shoe on,

11:40.656 --> 11:42.049
but I think I broke my ankle.

11:42.092 --> 11:44.791
But I'm gonna still try
to find the other one.

11:44.834 --> 11:46.706
- Guys, this is taking
way too long.

11:46.749 --> 11:48.359
When she gets back,
we have to pedal faster.

11:48.403 --> 11:50.231
- Sorry, I have a gunshot wound
in my leg.

11:50.274 --> 11:52.407
- It didn't even hit bone,
you sissy.

11:52.450 --> 11:55.192
- Oh, if you're in pain,
here have some of this.

11:55.236 --> 11:56.759
It's bubblegum flavored gin.

11:56.803 --> 11:58.282
- I can't.
I'm two years sober.

11:58.326 --> 11:59.806
- What? No you're not.
You got drunk

11:59.849 --> 12:01.285
and crashed
into the power plant.

12:01.329 --> 12:03.331
- Yeah, that was a relapse.
I fell off the wagon.

12:03.374 --> 12:06.073
- Okay, so you're clearly
lying, which means...

12:06.116 --> 12:07.727
you planted
the bottle of vodka.

12:07.770 --> 12:09.380
- Which means the crash
wasn't an accident.

12:09.424 --> 12:10.947
- And you caused the blackout
on purpose, why?

12:10.991 --> 12:12.079
- I don't know
what you're talking about.

12:12.122 --> 12:13.645
I just drank too much
and that was--

12:13.689 --> 12:15.822
She's fingering my wound!

12:15.865 --> 12:18.041
- Tell us what you're up to.

12:18.085 --> 12:20.391
- The banks! We're hitting
all the banks on Union.

12:20.435 --> 12:21.436
- Dotty, stop.
- Please let go.

12:21.479 --> 12:22.654
- Dotty, that's
against the law.

12:22.698 --> 12:24.004
- I am the law.

12:24.047 --> 12:25.222
- What made you like this?

12:25.266 --> 12:26.658
All right, Charles.
We gotta stop them.

12:26.702 --> 12:28.138
- We can't.
That's in the wrong direction.

12:28.182 --> 12:29.923
That's away from Amy.
- But it's near the hospital.

12:29.966 --> 12:31.402
We can pedal down there,
stop the robberies,

12:31.446 --> 12:32.795
and then I'll meet her
at First Presbyterian.

12:32.839 --> 12:34.275
That's perfect.
- Okay,

12:34.318 --> 12:38.105
so I didn't find my other shoe,
but I did meet Luis.

12:38.148 --> 12:39.933
He told me he's Aquaman.

12:39.976 --> 12:42.283
- Bit of a stretch,
but welcome to the team, Luis!

12:42.326 --> 12:43.632
Let's do it!

12:43.675 --> 12:45.852
- Okay, your contractions
are three minutes apart.

12:45.895 --> 12:47.157
It's officially time to go
to the hospital.

12:47.201 --> 12:48.463
- Not yet.

12:48.506 --> 12:51.248
- Do you know how thin
your cervix is right now?

12:51.292 --> 12:53.076
Yeah, I'm worried, so I started
reading the book

12:53.120 --> 12:54.382
I found on Jake's desk.

12:54.425 --> 12:57.820
I do not want to be around
when page 53 happens!

12:57.864 --> 12:59.082
- Hank wants to know
if we can cut emergency power

12:59.126 --> 13:00.127
to the third floor.

13:00.170 --> 13:01.302
Let me talk to him.

13:01.345 --> 13:02.303
- Hey!

13:02.346 --> 13:03.478
If you page 53 in front me,

13:03.521 --> 13:05.132
our relationship
will never be the same.

13:05.175 --> 13:07.961
- Make sure you don't look
at page 214.

13:08.004 --> 13:09.832
- What?
Why?

13:09.876 --> 13:13.227
- Mosey forward,
name in lights, butt pop.

13:13.270 --> 13:14.924
Comb your hair.

13:14.968 --> 13:16.883
Now typing motion,
pull it back.

13:16.926 --> 13:18.841
Jump forward,
pelvic pump.

13:18.885 --> 13:20.147
- You got it!

13:20.190 --> 13:21.844
Now, all we need to do
is run it all together

13:21.888 --> 13:22.845
and do it at full speed.

13:22.889 --> 13:23.933
- I must say, Jeffords,

13:23.977 --> 13:25.282
this dancing
is quite distracting.

13:25.326 --> 13:26.936
I've completely forgotten
that we're trapped here

13:26.980 --> 13:28.198
in this death box

13:28.242 --> 13:31.419
inspected by Bozo Beverly
between clown shows.

13:31.462 --> 13:33.334
- You know what, sir?
I don't think

13:33.377 --> 13:36.424
you are thrusting
your butt enough

13:36.467 --> 13:38.165
before the name in lights.

13:38.208 --> 13:40.515
- Yes, yes.
I felt that.

13:40.558 --> 13:42.082
God, I love that note.

13:42.125 --> 13:43.866
Back to the top.

13:43.910 --> 13:46.173
I'll count us in.
Five, six, seven, eight.

13:46.216 --> 13:47.870
- NYPD, put your hands
in the air!

13:47.914 --> 13:49.350
You're under arrest.
We'll read you your rights

13:49.393 --> 13:51.395
on the Pedal Pub.
Charles?

13:51.439 --> 13:54.355
Come on, put on the zip-ties.
Move, move, move!

13:54.398 --> 13:56.139
- Hey, what's taking so long?

13:56.183 --> 13:58.838
- Look, I can do it safely
or I can do it quickly.

13:58.881 --> 14:01.362
- Do it quickly.
- Oh, I can't do it quickly.

14:01.405 --> 14:03.190
You called my bluff.

14:03.233 --> 14:05.235
Oh, the lights are on.

14:05.279 --> 14:07.847
- ♪ Spank that bottom
spank that bo-- ♪

14:10.850 --> 14:13.374
We will never speak
of this again.

14:13.417 --> 14:16.159
- Status update: I called
in every officer I could.

14:16.203 --> 14:17.944
I green-lit
double shifts and overtime.

14:17.987 --> 14:19.902
We're coordinating with the 9-6
on traffic control.

14:19.946 --> 14:21.512
We haven't processed anyone,
so there's a backlog of perps

14:21.556 --> 14:22.557
on the third floor,

14:22.600 --> 14:23.514
and I have to go
to the hospital

14:23.558 --> 14:24.951
because my water broke.

14:24.994 --> 14:27.040
- You're having a baby?
Amy, this is so wond--

14:31.435 --> 14:33.133
- We can just catch up
after the baby comes.

14:35.091 --> 14:37.006
- Wait, wait, wait, stop!
The power's back.

14:37.050 --> 14:40.923
- Oh, yuck, none of you are
cute with the lights fully on.

14:40.967 --> 14:42.403
- You wanna play
mean girl, Kayla?

14:42.446 --> 14:44.927
Two can play at that game.
Let's talk about your bangs.

14:44.971 --> 14:46.146
- Charles, not now,
I'm calling Amy.

14:46.189 --> 14:48.148
- Jake?
- Hey, Ames,

14:48.191 --> 14:49.540
I'm so sorry we're
not there yet,

14:49.584 --> 14:50.846
but a guy fell down the stairs,

14:50.890 --> 14:51.891
and then the old lady
shot a perp

14:51.934 --> 14:53.240
and then we stopped
a bank robbery--

14:53.283 --> 14:54.894
- And I lost my shoe.
- And Kayla lost her shoe,

14:54.937 --> 14:56.112
but we're almost
to the hospital.

14:56.156 --> 14:57.244
Are you there yet?
What room are you in?

14:57.287 --> 14:58.419
- The break room.

14:58.462 --> 14:59.942
- What?
Why?

14:59.986 --> 15:02.336
- There isn't enough time.
I have to have the baby here.

15:02.379 --> 15:04.816
- But me and my crazy crew
made it to the hospital.

15:04.860 --> 15:06.209
That's our birth story!

15:06.253 --> 15:08.472
- Screw your birth story,
just get here!

15:11.823 --> 15:13.869
- You're giving birth
at the precinct?

15:13.913 --> 15:15.001
Is that safe?
- It's gonna be okay.

15:15.044 --> 15:16.437
There's a bunch
of firefighters here.

15:16.480 --> 15:18.004
- Right, and they're basically
just glorified EMTs

15:18.047 --> 15:19.396
that live together
and sleep in bunk beds.

15:19.440 --> 15:21.311
- Jake, she's gonna be okay.

15:21.355 --> 15:22.486
I just don't think
she can talk right now.

15:22.530 --> 15:23.923
- Okay, just tell her
that I love her

15:23.966 --> 15:24.967
and that I'll get there
as fast as I can.

15:25.011 --> 15:26.751
- Hey, Amy,
can we have a second?

15:26.795 --> 15:28.753
- Joe, I'm kind of in the
middle of something,

15:28.797 --> 15:33.628
you !

15:33.671 --> 15:37.632
- Oh yeah?
Well  yourself!

15:37.675 --> 15:39.634
- All right, all right.
- Just come.

15:39.677 --> 15:41.549
We have something to show you.

15:45.422 --> 15:46.684
You made me a birthing suite?

15:46.728 --> 15:48.773
- We've been napping at work
for 20 years.

15:48.817 --> 15:50.732
We know how to create
a relaxing space

15:50.775 --> 15:51.733
in a police station.

15:51.776 --> 15:53.082
- Gurney.
- Fire blankets.

15:53.126 --> 15:54.475
- Night stick for back massage.

15:54.518 --> 15:57.434
- Soothing lighting.
- AKA Scully's fart candles.

15:57.478 --> 15:58.740
- I'm sorry I said
you were worthless

15:58.783 --> 15:59.959
in an emergency.

16:00.002 --> 16:01.003
You two really came through.

16:01.047 --> 16:02.439
- It's just nice to have a win

16:02.483 --> 16:04.311
after what we
went through today.

16:04.354 --> 16:06.748
So many deviled eggs were lost,
and for what?

16:06.791 --> 16:08.532
- Hey, hey,
you can't focus on that.

16:08.576 --> 16:10.317
There were hundreds of
meatballs that were eaten

16:10.360 --> 16:12.014
because of you!
- I could've eaten more.

16:12.058 --> 16:13.581
- Just one more!
- Guys?

16:13.624 --> 16:15.887
- Not now, Amy.

16:15.931 --> 16:17.454
- How am I going to get back
to the precinct?

16:17.498 --> 16:18.803
This thing is way too slow.

16:18.847 --> 16:20.631
- Not if we all band together
and pedal like hell.

16:20.675 --> 16:22.024
- It's not gonna happen,
Charles.

16:22.068 --> 16:24.635
Dotty's asleep,
Kayla's flirting with Luis,

16:24.679 --> 16:26.420
and Briana's peeing
in a trash can.

16:26.463 --> 16:27.769
That's illegal, Briana.

16:27.812 --> 16:30.554
- Oh, you know you love it.

16:30.598 --> 16:32.600
- I'm gonna miss
the birth of my son.

16:32.643 --> 16:34.036
- No, you're not.

16:34.080 --> 16:35.472
Look, I didn't want
to have to do this,

16:35.516 --> 16:37.126
but there is someone
I can call.

16:37.170 --> 16:38.649
- Who?

16:38.693 --> 16:39.911
- Hello, Peanut Butter.

16:39.955 --> 16:41.957
I know we don't see eye-to-eye.

16:42.001 --> 16:43.132
But we gotta put that behind us

16:43.176 --> 16:44.438
because my friend here--

16:44.481 --> 16:45.439
- Charles,
the horse was a great idea

16:45.482 --> 16:46.483
but we don't have time for you

16:46.527 --> 16:47.658
to have
a heart-to-heart with it.

16:47.702 --> 16:48.920
- Sorry, I'm just
very emotional, Jake.

16:48.964 --> 16:50.922
Take care of my friend,
you four-legged bastard!

16:53.099 --> 16:54.448
You know, now that I'm up here,

16:54.491 --> 16:55.753
I realize I don't know
how to ride a horse.

16:55.797 --> 16:56.972
It's probably pretty
self-explanatory, right?

16:57.016 --> 16:58.930
- Yah!
- Oh, no!

16:58.974 --> 17:01.890
Move! Everyone move, I don't
know how to ride a horse!

17:04.849 --> 17:07.113
- Okay, Amy.
I know you're in a lot of pain,

17:07.156 --> 17:08.679
but we don't have
any meds here.

17:08.723 --> 17:10.072
You just gotta try
not to focus on it.

17:10.116 --> 17:11.943
Can you distract her?
- I got this.

17:11.987 --> 17:14.163
Hey, Amy, they come out
with any new binders recently?

17:14.207 --> 17:15.817
- I don't want to talk
about binders, Rosa.

17:15.860 --> 17:16.818
- All right,
that was my big gun.

17:16.861 --> 17:17.819
She's just gonna feel this.

17:17.862 --> 17:19.125
- Not necessarily.

17:19.168 --> 17:20.517
I was just checking to see
if there was anything

17:20.561 --> 17:21.736
we could do to help.

17:21.779 --> 17:24.043
And I hate to say it,
but I think there is.

17:24.086 --> 17:26.697
- Oh, you think he's gonna
get me drugs from evidence?

17:26.741 --> 17:29.004
- Uh, no.

17:29.048 --> 17:30.745
Something way weirder
is happening.

17:30.788 --> 17:31.920
- Hit it, Jeffords.

17:35.837 --> 17:37.665
♪ Ah, push it

17:39.493 --> 17:41.582
♪ Ah, push it

17:42.670 --> 17:45.151
♪ Get up on this
♪ Ah, push it

17:46.761 --> 17:48.806
- I am definitely distracted.

18:02.472 --> 18:04.170
- Oh, God, oh, God,
oh, God, oh, God.

18:04.213 --> 18:05.954
- I can see the head.
Rosa, get over here.

18:05.997 --> 18:07.129
I'm gonna need
a second set of hands.

18:07.173 --> 18:08.130
- No, no, no,
she really doesn't wanna

18:08.174 --> 18:09.131
be down on that end.

18:09.175 --> 18:10.567
- No, it's okay.
I got this.

18:10.611 --> 18:11.568
I can close my eyes, right?

18:11.612 --> 18:13.048
- Keep them open.
- Oh, damn it.

18:13.092 --> 18:14.571
- Just keep pushing,
you're almost there.

18:14.615 --> 18:15.920
- Oh, but Jake's not here yet.

18:15.964 --> 18:17.226
- Yes I am! I'm here.

18:17.270 --> 18:19.489
- Oh, Jake.
- I can't believe I made it.

18:19.533 --> 18:20.664
I'm gonna see the birth of my--

18:20.708 --> 18:22.231
We're on page 53!

18:22.275 --> 18:23.798
Babe, we're on page 53.

18:23.841 --> 18:24.842
I know!

18:24.886 --> 18:25.887
- I rode a horse.

18:33.547 --> 18:36.463
- Well, we did it, Ames.

18:36.506 --> 18:38.769
We made
the world's hottest baby.

18:38.813 --> 18:39.944
- Say cute, Jake,

18:39.988 --> 18:42.033
- Nope.
This kid is liquid fire.

18:43.296 --> 18:45.689
- Crazy to think that
in just 17 short years

18:45.733 --> 18:46.951
he's gonna be 6'7"

18:46.995 --> 18:48.605
and the number one draft pick
for the Knicks.

18:48.649 --> 18:51.217
- Aw, and that he's gonna
pass up that opportunity

18:51.260 --> 18:53.132
to pursue his true passion--

18:53.175 --> 18:54.611
library sciences.

18:54.655 --> 18:55.743
- Well the important thing is,

18:55.786 --> 18:56.744
we'll support him
no matter what.

18:56.787 --> 18:57.788
- Hmm.

18:57.832 --> 18:59.790
- Even if he's
a huge, huge, nerd.

18:59.834 --> 19:01.488
- Especially then.

19:02.967 --> 19:05.970
Are we gonna be okay at this?

19:06.014 --> 19:07.146
I mean, this entire day

19:07.189 --> 19:09.104
felt like a warning
from the universe.

19:09.148 --> 19:10.149
I almost missed the birth,

19:10.192 --> 19:11.715
we had our baby
at the precinct,

19:11.759 --> 19:13.239
a firefighter
touched our child.

19:13.282 --> 19:15.676
- You washed him off?
- Yeah, but I'll always know.

19:15.719 --> 19:17.765
- Babe, we talked about this.

19:17.808 --> 19:19.810
Everyone balances
work and kids.

19:19.854 --> 19:21.725
- Yeah, but everyone's
not a cop.

19:21.769 --> 19:23.205
- True, but...

19:23.249 --> 19:26.165
when our son wants to hear
about the day he was born,

19:26.208 --> 19:28.645
we get to tell him that his dad

19:28.689 --> 19:30.212
helped a bunch of people

19:30.256 --> 19:33.737
and foiled a bank robbery.

19:33.781 --> 19:35.826
- Guess that was kind of cool.

19:35.870 --> 19:38.220
- And his mom managed
a city-wide emergency

19:38.264 --> 19:40.527
while actually giving birth.

19:42.746 --> 19:45.793
I'm proud for our son
to have you as a dad.

19:45.836 --> 19:47.838
- Me too.

19:47.882 --> 19:49.666
For you to be the mom.

19:49.710 --> 19:52.539
I wasn't just agreeing with the
nice thing you said about me.

19:52.582 --> 19:53.670
- I love you.

19:53.714 --> 19:54.845
- Love you too.

19:54.889 --> 19:57.631
- Oh, my God, he's beautiful.

19:57.674 --> 19:59.981
Oh, Jake, he's got your face.

20:00.024 --> 20:02.244
- Charles, meet Mac.

20:02.288 --> 20:03.637
- Short for McClane.

20:03.680 --> 20:06.030
- As in Shirley?
I love it.

20:06.074 --> 20:08.685
- No, as in John,
from "Die Hard."

20:08.729 --> 20:10.209
- I mean,
they're both incredibly cool.

20:10.252 --> 20:11.384
Only one Oscar winner.

20:11.427 --> 20:13.037
- Thanks for getting Jake
there in time.

20:13.081 --> 20:14.648
- Oh, don't thank me.

20:14.691 --> 20:17.607
The real hero is Lieutenant
Peanut Butter.

20:17.651 --> 20:19.696
- No, it was all you, Charles.

20:19.740 --> 20:21.002
Or should I say...

20:21.045 --> 20:22.090
Uncle Charles.
- Chee-Chee.

20:22.133 --> 20:23.222
- Don't ruin this moment
for yourself.

20:23.265 --> 20:25.615
- Uncle Charles it is.

20:25.659 --> 20:27.748
- How's he doing?
- He's perfect.

20:27.791 --> 20:29.184
I see you changed.
- Oh yeah.

20:29.228 --> 20:31.142
That other outfit had a lot
of afterbirth on it.

20:31.186 --> 20:32.709
Also during-birth
and pre-birth.

20:32.753 --> 20:33.797
The point is I burned it.

20:33.841 --> 20:35.103
- Thanks for staying
by my side.

20:35.146 --> 20:36.670
I know it wasn't easy for you.

20:36.713 --> 20:38.237
- It was worth it.
I'm Auntie Ro-Ro.

20:38.280 --> 20:40.282
- She gets to be Ro-Ro?
Incredible.

20:40.326 --> 20:42.589
I've thrown seven years
away for this.

20:42.632 --> 20:44.286
- Captain, Lieutenant,

20:44.330 --> 20:46.114
the dance was great,

20:46.157 --> 20:48.377
and it really helped,
thank you.

20:48.421 --> 20:49.857
- Dance? What dance?

20:49.900 --> 20:51.162
- She doesn't know
what she's talking about.

20:51.206 --> 20:52.642
Mommy brain much?

20:52.686 --> 20:55.166
- Captain Holt and I did
a hip-hop dance routine.

20:55.210 --> 20:57.081
- Oh.

20:57.125 --> 20:58.866
I see.
You know what?

20:58.909 --> 21:00.128
I don't even care
that I missed it,

21:00.171 --> 21:03.174
because right now,
I am holding my son,

21:03.218 --> 21:04.175
and there's nothing
more important

21:04.219 --> 21:05.307
in the world than that.

21:05.351 --> 21:06.613
- I have a video,
if you wanna see it.

21:06.656 --> 21:08.267
- Amy, hold this baby.
Rosa, give me that phone.

21:08.310 --> 21:09.355
Give me that phone.

21:09.398 --> 21:10.356
Everyone wash your hands.

21:10.399 --> 21:12.358
- Not a doctor.
- Shh.

21:12.401 --> 21:14.621
- Fremulon.
