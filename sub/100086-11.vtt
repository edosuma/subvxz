WEBVTT

00:01.653 --> 00:04.178
ADULT ADAM: Back in the '80s, the hottest trends were Jams,

00:04.221 --> 00:07.224
Wayfarer, Swatch watches,
and acid-wash jeans.

00:07.268 --> 00:09.052
But at William Penn Academy,

00:09.096 --> 00:11.272
there was one item
of colorful wool clothing

00:11.315 --> 00:13.535
that the biggest trendsetters were never without.

00:13.578 --> 00:16.755
Is it just me,
or does everyone but us
have a letterman jacket?

00:16.799 --> 00:18.192
Speak for yourself, bro.

00:18.235 --> 00:20.368
Did I miss the day
they sell the clothes
from the lost and found?

00:20.411 --> 00:23.110
We earned these.
I lettered in badminton.

00:23.153 --> 00:24.067
Dive team.
Bass fishing.

00:24.111 --> 00:26.069
Wow. This school's
athletic department

00:26.113 --> 00:27.984
has really grown
in the last few years.

00:28.028 --> 00:29.507
Yep, I'm a jock now,

00:29.551 --> 00:31.596
and I get
all the sweet benefits
that come with it.

00:31.640 --> 00:33.555
Hello, my romantic equal.

00:33.598 --> 00:35.905
Die, dork.
And the dance begins.

00:35.948 --> 00:37.907
Well, it's not like I need
a stupid varsity letter

00:37.950 --> 00:39.256
to get into film school.

00:39.300 --> 00:40.779
Au contraire.
Balls!

00:40.823 --> 00:43.565
And balls may be
exactly what you
need, Mr. Goldberg.

00:43.608 --> 00:45.741
You need to round out
your personal journey

00:45.784 --> 00:47.569
with some
athletic challenges.

00:47.612 --> 00:49.614
But people who make movies
don't care about sports.

00:49.658 --> 00:50.920
Not true.

00:50.963 --> 00:52.965
Alfred Hitchcock...
Star tailback.

00:53.009 --> 00:54.141
Ron Howard...
Decathlete.

00:54.184 --> 00:55.925
Ridley Scott...
Hockey goon.

00:55.968 --> 00:58.145
That all seems
super wrong.

00:58.188 --> 01:00.060
But are you saying
if I don't get
a varsity letter,

01:00.103 --> 01:01.278
I won't get
into film school?

01:01.322 --> 01:02.975
I'm not
not saying that.

01:03.019 --> 01:05.021
Luckily,
I'm heading up a revival

01:05.065 --> 01:08.329
of a storied William Penn
athletic institution.

01:08.372 --> 01:09.504
Pickleball!

01:09.547 --> 01:11.767
The sport of kings!

01:11.810 --> 01:15.379
This is William Penn's
last championship
pickleball team.

01:15.423 --> 01:16.772
Anyone look familiar?

01:16.815 --> 01:18.295
Is that Vidal Sassoon?

01:18.339 --> 01:21.603
That's me...
Earl "Mr. March" Ball.

01:21.646 --> 01:23.822
March was the month
for the tri-state
pickleball finals,

01:23.866 --> 01:25.128
hence the sobriquet.

01:25.172 --> 01:26.564
I mostly follow.

01:26.608 --> 01:27.565
Nice hair.
What happened?

01:27.609 --> 01:28.871
Time.

01:28.914 --> 01:30.655
She's a cruel thief.

01:30.699 --> 01:32.222
She took my golden locks

01:32.266 --> 01:33.832
but also
my precious pickleball

01:33.876 --> 01:35.356
from the fore
of mainstream sports.

01:35.399 --> 01:36.705
Come on.
Pickleball was
never a thing.

01:36.748 --> 01:38.489
How dare you?

01:38.533 --> 01:40.230
It swept the nation!

01:40.274 --> 01:41.666
You seem fired up
for some reason,

01:41.710 --> 01:43.059
so I'll match
your emotion.

01:43.103 --> 01:44.930
Let's do this giant
ping-pong thing!

01:44.974 --> 01:46.541
That's the spirit!

01:46.584 --> 01:47.977
Coach Nick,

01:48.020 --> 01:50.806
we got a fresh cucumber
ready to be brined.

01:50.849 --> 01:53.069
Coach him up.
Never.

01:53.113 --> 01:56.028
I'm done with you pushing
your filthy pickle in my gym.

01:56.072 --> 01:57.769
Please remember,
words matter,

01:57.813 --> 01:59.989
and I am the principal
of this school.

02:00.032 --> 02:03.123
And I am the principal
of this gym.

02:03.166 --> 02:06.169
The gym is inside the school,
so I am principal of both.

02:06.213 --> 02:07.605
Damn it.
That tracks.

02:07.649 --> 02:10.478
But I'll still never coach
this sorry excuse for a sport.

02:10.521 --> 02:13.220
Yeah, seems like Coach Nick's
got some stuff going on.

02:13.263 --> 02:15.352
Why don't you
just jump out there
and show us what you got?

02:15.396 --> 02:18.616
Hey, everyone.
Let's have some fun.

02:18.660 --> 02:19.922
Fresh dill
coming your way.

02:19.965 --> 02:22.098
Oh, that seems cute...

02:22.142 --> 02:23.360
Welcome to the pickle, bitch.

02:23.404 --> 02:24.318
Such a regal game.

02:26.581 --> 02:28.452
♪ I'm twisted up inside

02:28.496 --> 02:30.759
♪ But nonetheless,
I feel the need to say

02:34.371 --> 02:35.807
♪ I don't know the future

02:35.851 --> 02:39.507
♪ But the past keeps getting
clearer every day ♪

02:39.550 --> 02:42.031
ADULT ADAM:
It was January 15th,
1980-something,

02:42.074 --> 02:43.815
and with my dad's birthday
fast approaching,

02:43.859 --> 02:45.861
my mom was on edge.

02:45.904 --> 02:48.168
Murray's turning 51
and has forbidden me

02:48.211 --> 02:50.431
from exercising
my greatest gift.

02:50.474 --> 02:52.737
Pointing out when someone's
put on a couple of pounds?

02:52.781 --> 02:54.609
I'm very perceptive.
I can hear it over the phone.

02:54.652 --> 02:56.132
But no,

02:56.176 --> 02:58.308
it's planning elaborate,
over-the-top birthday parties.

02:58.352 --> 03:01.137
ADULT ADAM: That's exactly
what she'd done for
my dad's 50th birthday,

03:01.181 --> 03:03.095
but it turned out
he hated parties,

03:03.139 --> 03:05.968
so he fell asleep
under a pile of coats
and missed the whole thing.

03:06.011 --> 03:08.318
Which is why we're just having
a stupid family dinner

03:08.362 --> 03:10.233
and I'm presenting him
with this tiny scrapbook.

03:10.277 --> 03:13.280
"Murray Goldberg...
Husband, Father,

03:13.323 --> 03:15.760
"President of
our United Hearts

03:15.804 --> 03:16.979
"Volume 18"?

03:17.022 --> 03:18.676
Well, a legacy this rich

03:18.720 --> 03:20.635
can't be contained
in one volume.

03:20.678 --> 03:24.291
The man has two shirts.
I think it can be done.

03:24.334 --> 03:25.857
Where'd you get
all this stuff, anyway?

03:25.901 --> 03:27.642
His dad gave me a box
of old memories.

03:27.685 --> 03:29.078
Grumpy Ben?

03:29.121 --> 03:32.212
I thought he hated memories
and Murray and boxes.

03:32.255 --> 03:33.691
Yeah, he's not great.

03:33.735 --> 03:35.737
Yo, where's your checkbook?
There's a shirt I want.

03:35.780 --> 03:38.174
I mean...
I need to recharge
my hug batteries.

03:38.218 --> 03:40.350
Has college
taught you nothing?

03:40.394 --> 03:42.222
You open with
the hug nonsense.

03:42.265 --> 03:43.701
Go ahead.
It's in my purse.

03:45.050 --> 03:47.270
Cheggit, it's Dad's
birth certificate.

03:47.314 --> 03:49.098
Whoa.
He was a big baby.

03:49.141 --> 03:51.405
They didn't even bother
with the ounces.

03:51.448 --> 03:53.015
He's actually a year younger
than we thought he was.

03:53.058 --> 03:54.495
Wait.
That can't be right.

03:54.538 --> 03:55.800
Trust me, Bev,

03:55.844 --> 03:57.933
the feds don't
get this stuff wrong.

03:57.976 --> 03:59.369
Full disclosure...

03:59.413 --> 04:00.675
I thought Dad
was in his mid-60s.

04:00.718 --> 04:01.763
If this is real,

04:01.806 --> 04:05.114
then that means Murray
is turning 50 again,

04:05.157 --> 04:06.507
which means I get a redo.

04:06.550 --> 04:08.117
That's your takeaway?

04:08.160 --> 04:09.423
I wish I could redo
coming over here.

04:09.466 --> 04:12.252
By the power vested
in me by me,

04:12.295 --> 04:15.646
I am throwing Murray
a second 50th birthday party.

04:15.690 --> 04:17.431
Yeah, I don't think
he's gonna be excited

04:17.474 --> 04:19.650
about the party
or the life-changing error

04:19.694 --> 04:20.564
that will rock him
to his core.

04:20.608 --> 04:22.174
Pishposh.

04:22.218 --> 04:24.351
Murray is gonna be thrilled
to hear the great news.

04:24.394 --> 04:25.526
What the hell am I?

04:25.569 --> 04:27.049
50!

04:27.092 --> 04:28.659
Now you get to enjoy

04:28.703 --> 04:32.054
the unspeakably grand
second 50th extravaganza

04:32.097 --> 04:33.447
that I am somehow

04:33.490 --> 04:34.535
gonna pull together
at the last minute.

04:34.578 --> 04:36.363
I'm sorry.
I-I'm kinda reeling here.

04:36.406 --> 04:37.625
My whole life's
been a lie.

04:37.668 --> 04:39.017
Big-time.

04:39.061 --> 04:40.889
If I had to guess,
it's that your hateful father

04:40.932 --> 04:43.152
screwed up yet another detail
of your childhood.

04:43.195 --> 04:45.807
But, hey,
cake and presents.

04:45.850 --> 04:47.287
That rotten bastard.

04:47.330 --> 04:48.940
Just go talk to him,
tell him how you feel.

04:48.984 --> 04:50.986
Oh, I'm gonna
talk to him, all right.

04:51.029 --> 04:52.292
I'm gonna talk to him good.

04:52.335 --> 04:54.468
And also give him
this invitation.

04:54.511 --> 04:56.208
How did you get these
printed up so quickly?

04:56.252 --> 04:57.514
I get things done.

04:57.558 --> 04:59.386
Now you go get this done
with your dad

04:59.429 --> 05:00.952
so we can finally
have my party...

05:00.996 --> 05:03.128
Your party.
Your party.

05:03.172 --> 05:05.392
ADULT ADAM: While my dad
had a bone to pick
with his dad,

05:05.435 --> 05:08.177
I had handpicked someone
to help me kick butt
at pickleball.

05:08.220 --> 05:09.613
Barry,
I need your help.

05:09.657 --> 05:12.007
No can do, bro.
I've got a midterm.

05:12.050 --> 05:13.530
But I have
a sports emergency.

05:14.662 --> 05:17.273
Say no more.
But first, say more.

05:17.317 --> 05:18.840
What is the sport?
Pickleball.

05:18.883 --> 05:20.798
You will be a champion
within hours.

05:20.842 --> 05:22.931
You can do that?

05:22.974 --> 05:24.715
Your relentless training
begins now.

05:24.759 --> 05:27.109
I could barely do
a regular push-up.

05:27.152 --> 05:28.850
This is just you
sitting on me.

05:28.893 --> 05:31.853
If you can catch
a pickle blindfolded,
you can do anything.

05:31.896 --> 05:33.942
Barry... Oh, oh!
Look alive.

05:33.985 --> 05:35.987
Oh, God! They're wet
and surprisingly hard.

05:36.031 --> 05:37.162
Oh, I'm so sorry.

05:37.206 --> 05:39.251
Wax on, wax off.

05:39.295 --> 05:40.601
This is how
Daniel -sanlearned

05:40.644 --> 05:42.690
basic defensive
karate moves.

05:42.733 --> 05:45.562
And how to apply
an important coat of wax
before it rains.

05:45.606 --> 05:46.955
Barry...

05:46.998 --> 05:49.131
You do know how to play
pickleball, don't you?

05:49.174 --> 05:50.828
Till today,
I never heard of pickleball.

05:50.872 --> 05:52.830
So this was just you
sitting on me

05:52.874 --> 05:54.615
and winging pickles
at my head

05:54.658 --> 05:56.530
and having me
clean your car?

05:56.573 --> 05:58.445
Totally. Wouldn't it be
cool if those things

05:58.488 --> 06:00.229
actually made you good
at pickleball?

06:00.272 --> 06:01.622
You were last my hope.

06:01.665 --> 06:03.058
Who am I supposed
to turn to now?

06:03.101 --> 06:04.712
Chill.

06:04.755 --> 06:07.410
I'll take you to my sports
mentor, Coach Mellor.

06:07.454 --> 06:09.238
But Coach Mellor
disappeared

06:09.281 --> 06:11.588
to follow his dream
to coach wrestling
to adult men in the woods.

06:11.632 --> 06:13.503
We'll never find him.
And yet we will.

06:13.547 --> 06:15.462
I'll tell the police
he robbed us at gunpoint.

06:15.505 --> 06:17.246
Then they'll have to
find him for us.

06:17.289 --> 06:18.465
Or we could just ask
his brother.

06:18.508 --> 06:19.988
Not as fun, but I guess.

06:20.031 --> 06:21.990
Is that one of those pickles
you threw at me earlier?

06:22.033 --> 06:24.862
When you get to college,
you'll learn
the value of a pickle.

06:24.906 --> 06:27.256
ADULT ADAM: While Barry and I set off to find Coach Mellor,

06:27.299 --> 06:29.867
my dad was about
to go off on Pop-Pop.

06:29.911 --> 06:31.739
Where you been?
I've been out here
five minutes.

06:31.782 --> 06:34.089
Oh, I thought you were
that busybody lady
from across the street

06:34.132 --> 06:36.352
who's always trying
to bring me food,
make sure I'm okay.

06:36.396 --> 06:39.790
Open the door next time,
have a conversation,
that'll get rid of her.

06:39.834 --> 06:42.010
What's crawling up
your ass?This.

06:42.053 --> 06:43.707
What is that?
Deed to your fancy house?

06:43.751 --> 06:46.188
Came here
to rub it in my face?
Nicely played.

06:46.231 --> 06:47.537
It's my birth certificate.

06:47.581 --> 06:49.278
It says I'm a year younger
than I thought.

06:49.321 --> 06:50.584
Yeah. Well, oops.

06:50.627 --> 06:52.629
"Oops"? How the hell
did this happen?

06:52.673 --> 06:55.676
I was busy.
I didn't have time for things
like birthdays or meals

06:55.719 --> 06:57.068
or wherever the hell
you were.

06:57.112 --> 06:58.461
So, you've known
about this my whole life?

06:58.505 --> 07:00.376
No, no.
Not your whole life.

07:00.420 --> 07:01.725
I noticed it
when you were about 12...

07:01.769 --> 07:02.857
Or, I guess, 11.

07:02.900 --> 07:04.293
Unbelievable.

07:04.336 --> 07:05.947
Oh, come on.
What difference
did it make?

07:05.990 --> 07:07.557
The difference
of a year.

07:07.601 --> 07:10.952
Here we go again,
his highness bellyaching
about his birthday.

07:10.995 --> 07:13.041
What birthday?
You never even gave me one.

07:13.084 --> 07:15.130
La-di-da. Look who needs
a birthday every year.

07:15.173 --> 07:16.827
Who are you,
Colonel Sanders?

07:16.871 --> 07:19.351
The chicken guy?
He was fancy,
though, huh?

07:19.395 --> 07:21.397
I mean, who would
wear a white suit
around all those chickens?

07:21.441 --> 07:23.747
Fine. The Colonel
is a Southern dandy.

07:23.791 --> 07:26.228
But you never gave me
a card or a cake

07:26.271 --> 07:28.186
or, God forbid,
a present!

07:28.230 --> 07:29.884
Well, who knows
what kids want?

07:29.927 --> 07:31.320
I told you every year!

07:31.363 --> 07:32.756
Yeah, socks that
you'd call your own.

07:32.800 --> 07:35.280
No, a transistor radio
to listen to a ball game!

07:35.324 --> 07:36.847
Oh, boo-hoo.

07:36.891 --> 07:38.588
You know what
you did get?
A roof.

07:38.632 --> 07:40.982
Oh, you spoiled me
by letting me indoors.

07:41.025 --> 07:42.113
Can I just say something?

07:42.157 --> 07:43.288
Yeah, give me
your half-assed apology.

07:43.332 --> 07:45.421
I wasn't going to
apologize.

07:45.465 --> 07:48.206
What I was gonna say was
that if anybody handed me
an extra year,

07:48.250 --> 07:50.034
I wouldn't spend it
complaining about
not getting a pony.

07:50.078 --> 07:51.166
Transistor radio!

07:51.209 --> 07:52.994
There he goes again.

07:54.996 --> 07:58.390
Welcome to phase one
of your fabulous 50th
redo party.

07:58.434 --> 07:59.870
ALL:
♪ Happy Bir... ♪

07:59.914 --> 08:01.611
Not happy and no parties.

08:01.655 --> 08:02.699
I'll be in the shed.

08:04.179 --> 08:05.702
Check it out.

08:05.746 --> 08:08.009
The breeze from
his angry walk-by
blew out the candles.

08:08.052 --> 08:10.141
I wonder
what he wished for.

08:10.185 --> 08:12.187
If I had to guess,
to sit in the shed.

08:12.230 --> 08:14.929
ADULT ADAM: While my dad made party-planning a challenge,

08:14.972 --> 08:16.583
finding Coach Mellor was
easier than we thought.

08:16.626 --> 08:17.975
Coach Mellor?

08:18.019 --> 08:20.674
Well, well, well.
If it isn't the
Goldfarb boys.

08:20.717 --> 08:22.502
You look...
Like an old, stinky dook

08:22.545 --> 08:24.591
left in your favorite
running shoe,

08:24.634 --> 08:26.114
and you want
to go for a run,
but you can't,

08:26.157 --> 08:28.203
'cause that hot steamer
owns that shoe now.

08:28.246 --> 08:29.726
I was gonna say "sad,"
but sure,

08:29.770 --> 08:31.380
I guess your
dook-shoe story
is more colorful.

08:31.423 --> 08:32.860
What are you
doing here?

08:32.903 --> 08:34.122
I thought you were
at billionaire oddball

08:34.165 --> 08:36.037
John du Pont's
Foxcatcher Farm.

08:36.080 --> 08:37.517
I was, but those dark woods

08:37.560 --> 08:39.649
hid more secrets
than I'm willing to admit.

08:39.693 --> 08:41.433
But I turned that
"L" into a "W"

08:41.477 --> 08:43.131
by quitting coaching forever.

08:43.174 --> 08:45.437
But you were the one
who always said
winners never quit.

08:45.481 --> 08:48.266
And you said the only cure
for broken bones
is jumping jacks,

08:48.310 --> 08:50.225
which is medically wrong,
but inspiring, I guess.

08:50.268 --> 08:51.748
Sorry, boys,

08:51.792 --> 08:54.795
but I've hung up
my whistle...there.

08:56.100 --> 08:58.233
But it's
a sports emergency!

08:58.276 --> 08:59.713
It's true.

08:59.756 --> 09:01.541
Without you, I won't get
into the one school

09:01.584 --> 09:03.107
that guarantees
future success...

09:03.151 --> 09:04.674
Film school.

09:04.718 --> 09:06.067
You know,
I've spent so much time

09:06.110 --> 09:09.244
around jacked men
pushing physical
and societal limits

09:09.287 --> 09:11.768
that I forgot
the charming whine
of a little boy.

09:11.812 --> 09:13.944
Is that a yes?
Far from it. I'm no coach.

09:13.988 --> 09:15.250
Look at me.
I'm a mess.

09:15.293 --> 09:16.991
I've gained two pounds.

09:17.034 --> 09:19.297
Told you not to eat
that 17th almond.

09:19.341 --> 09:20.908
See that?
No self-control.

09:20.951 --> 09:23.606
Whatever your thing is...
I can't help you, boys.
I'm sorry.

09:23.650 --> 09:25.390
Wait, Coach,
is that you?

09:25.434 --> 09:27.262
Yeah, that's me.

09:27.305 --> 09:29.307
Were my delts
really that jacked?

09:29.351 --> 09:32.180
Damn it, Rick,
leave pickleball in the past,
where it belongs.

09:32.223 --> 09:34.095
You're just mad 'cause
I was a better P-Baller
than you were.

09:34.138 --> 09:35.705
Of course I am.

09:35.749 --> 09:37.533
I was an All-American
football player,

09:37.577 --> 09:39.883
but God didn't grace me
with the delicate wrists

09:39.927 --> 09:41.102
to wield that mighty paddle.

09:41.145 --> 09:43.626
Enough talk about
God's fickle nature.

09:43.670 --> 09:45.541
My pathetic-nerd brother

09:45.585 --> 09:46.803
needs someone to show him
how to pickle.

09:46.847 --> 09:49.110
It's true. I forgot
how pathetic
and nerdy he is.

09:49.153 --> 09:50.894
I don't really think
that's the main
takeaway here.

09:50.938 --> 09:53.070
Look at his spindly arms
and toothpick legs.

09:53.114 --> 09:55.812
His concave chest
and that doughy neck.

09:55.856 --> 09:57.814
And his flat feet
and sickly posture.

09:57.858 --> 09:59.250
Spin around, Adam.

09:59.294 --> 10:01.426
Show us how sad
the back of your body is.

10:01.470 --> 10:03.298
Yeah, my instinct
is to say no.

10:03.341 --> 10:05.735
You know what?
Seeing this tragic excuse

10:05.779 --> 10:07.432
for the human form
in its full non-glory

10:07.476 --> 10:09.086
is just the kick

10:09.130 --> 10:10.871
in the two-button
polyester shorts I needed.

10:12.568 --> 10:13.830
I'm back, baby!

10:13.874 --> 10:14.918
Whoo!

10:14.962 --> 10:16.877
And someone else
is back, too.

10:18.966 --> 10:20.010
Hello, old friend.

10:23.492 --> 10:25.537
Follow me to greatness, boys.

10:25.581 --> 10:27.104
ADULT ADAM: With that,
my training began.

10:29.803 --> 10:31.587
ADULT ADAM:
My dad didn't want
a birthday redo,

10:31.631 --> 10:34.242
but my mom wasn't gonna take
"no" for an answer.

10:34.285 --> 10:36.461
Welcome,
family and friends
of Murray Goldberg.

10:36.505 --> 10:39.073
I've assembled
this dream team,

10:39.116 --> 10:40.291
and Essie,

10:40.335 --> 10:42.685
together to brainstorm
some ideas

10:42.729 --> 10:45.557
for Murray's
50th surprise party.

10:45.601 --> 10:47.081
Geoff will be
writing down your ideas.

10:47.124 --> 10:48.473
Here's an idea.

10:48.517 --> 10:49.779
We don't
throw Dad a party

10:49.823 --> 10:51.172
because he clearly said
he doesn't want one.

10:51.215 --> 10:53.261
Boo!

10:53.304 --> 10:54.479
Don't write that down.

10:54.523 --> 10:55.567
But Erica's right, Bevy.

10:55.611 --> 10:57.787
The man chose a shed
over cake.

10:57.831 --> 11:00.355
That's only because he has
never truly had a birthday.

11:00.398 --> 11:03.880
Now, once Murray understands
the joy of celebrating
his special day,

11:03.924 --> 11:06.535
that shed won't seem
like such a fun option.

11:06.578 --> 11:09.146
Please. You just want a redo
of his last 50th birthday.

11:09.190 --> 11:11.061
Okay.
Let's get pitching.

11:11.105 --> 11:13.281
All right. What does
Murray Goldberg like?

11:13.324 --> 11:16.327
BEVERLY: Hmm.

11:16.371 --> 11:18.547
Hmm? Hmm? Hmm?
There are no bad ideas.

11:18.590 --> 11:20.201
Cheese?

11:20.244 --> 11:21.724
I'm also in
a cheese area.

11:21.768 --> 11:22.986
Did somebody
already say cheese?

11:23.030 --> 11:24.422
The man does love cheese.

11:24.466 --> 11:25.859
Now we're cooking
with gas.

11:25.902 --> 11:27.904
Okay, enough with cheese.
He likes other things.

11:27.948 --> 11:29.950
Bevy, maybe we should
get the ball rolling

11:29.993 --> 11:31.473
with things
he doesn't like.

11:31.516 --> 11:33.170
There's a lot of those.

11:33.214 --> 11:35.390
I'll start. People.

11:35.433 --> 11:37.131
Dancing.
The Dallas Cowboys.

11:37.174 --> 11:38.436
Neighbors who wave to him.

11:38.480 --> 11:39.829
Loud music.
Loud birds.

11:39.873 --> 11:41.744
Quiet birds.
Doctors who advertise.

11:41.788 --> 11:43.877
My nephew, Darrin, for some
reason I can't understand.

11:43.920 --> 11:46.140
Parties, which again
begs the question,

11:46.183 --> 11:47.489
why are we doing this?

11:47.532 --> 11:49.621
Mrs. Kremp, uh,
what did you say
after Vic said Cowboys?

11:49.665 --> 11:52.146
Okay, this has obviously
been a huge waste of time.

11:52.189 --> 11:53.538
Oh, I know!

11:53.582 --> 11:55.062
Firemen acting
like big shots.

11:56.237 --> 11:58.152
We're done, Vic.
Thanks for nothing.

11:58.195 --> 12:00.458
Now, I need you all to get
the  out of my house.

12:00.502 --> 12:01.721
But come back in three hours,

12:01.764 --> 12:03.461
and don't bring
any birds or Darrin.

12:03.505 --> 12:05.420
He spells it
with an "I."

12:05.463 --> 12:07.378
ADULT ADAM:
While my mom's party
committee fizzled out,

12:07.422 --> 12:09.554
I was ready to sizzle
on the pickleball court.

12:09.598 --> 12:10.904
You boys are in luck.

12:10.947 --> 12:14.037
Not only are you being trained
by a pickleball champion,

12:14.081 --> 12:17.258
but that champion happens
to have his own court.

12:17.301 --> 12:18.650
Ha-ha!

12:18.694 --> 12:21.175
Uh, you mean
this sad dirt patch?

12:21.218 --> 12:22.480
And the net's
all broken.

12:22.524 --> 12:23.655
You don't need a net.

12:23.699 --> 12:24.787
I don't know anything
about pickleball,

12:24.831 --> 12:26.354
but I'm pretty sure
you do.

12:26.397 --> 12:27.616
It's, like, the only
thing you need.

12:29.313 --> 12:30.401
Let's get to work.

12:33.622 --> 12:35.363
Lob! Lob! Lob!

12:35.406 --> 12:36.973
ADULT ADAM:
It was time to get
serious about pickleball.

12:37.017 --> 12:38.409
Erne! Erne! Erne!

12:38.453 --> 12:40.498
Luckily, I had two of the greatest sports mentors watching over me.

12:40.542 --> 12:42.631
Dink! Dink!
Half Volley!Half Volley.

12:42.674 --> 12:44.328
Thanks, Coach Echo.
Lob!

12:44.372 --> 12:46.200
Erne! Dink!
But I still sucked.

12:46.243 --> 12:48.289
Half Volley!
Big-time.

12:48.332 --> 12:50.726
So dense.

12:50.770 --> 12:53.555
That's the beets
and pears and bananas

12:53.598 --> 12:55.862
and a second type
of beet.

12:55.905 --> 12:58.125
Oh, yeah,
that's what I'm tasting.

12:58.168 --> 12:59.822
Nah, you're tasting
the brewer's yeast.

12:59.866 --> 13:01.084
Oh!

13:01.128 --> 13:02.520
Okay!

13:02.564 --> 13:04.305
But then something
crazy happened.

13:04.348 --> 13:05.523
Maybe it was
all the yelling

13:05.567 --> 13:07.090
or the beet smoothie.
Erne!

13:07.134 --> 13:09.614
Dink! Half Volley!
Either way, pickleball
started to make sense.

13:09.658 --> 13:10.746
Ooh.

13:10.790 --> 13:11.878
Ooh! I brought the heat.

13:11.921 --> 13:14.358
That's one spicy pickle,
Goldfarb.

13:14.402 --> 13:15.838
We did good work
here today, Coach.

13:15.882 --> 13:17.666
We really did.

13:17.709 --> 13:20.538
This is the first time
since I escaped that
compound by foot

13:20.582 --> 13:21.888
that I've felt
anything but numb.

13:21.931 --> 13:24.020
What happened there?
I'm not ready.

13:24.064 --> 13:25.326
But I think I kinda am.

13:25.369 --> 13:26.849
I say when
you're kinda ready.

13:28.068 --> 13:30.113
You're ready.
Kinda.

13:30.157 --> 13:32.463
Meanwhile, my mom was
ready to hit my dad

13:32.507 --> 13:35.075
with the best surprise
50th redo ever.

13:35.118 --> 13:37.817
Everyone, come on in.
Welcome to Murmania.

13:37.860 --> 13:39.340
Murmania?

13:39.383 --> 13:42.734
Indeed. A love letter
to my husband in party form.

13:42.778 --> 13:44.171
You might want
to remove your shoes,

13:44.214 --> 13:46.086
'cause I'm about
to knock your socks off.

13:46.129 --> 13:48.262
Well, I've got
a wicked bunion,
but okay.

13:48.305 --> 13:49.959
Pretzels and milk,
anyone?

13:50.003 --> 13:51.961
It's Mr. Goldberg's
favorite snackable drink.

13:52.005 --> 13:53.310
My dad likes it
for some reason.

13:53.354 --> 13:54.964
Behold.

13:55.008 --> 13:57.662
Holy moly.
Is that the guy
from Channel Five

13:57.706 --> 13:58.881
who hits the chime
when he does the weather?

14:01.188 --> 14:03.538
I'd recognize
that simple chime anywhere.

14:03.581 --> 14:04.931
Tonight's forecast...

14:04.974 --> 14:07.716
100% chance
of Murray's tears of joy.

14:07.759 --> 14:09.370
Oh, my.
What's happening here?

14:09.413 --> 14:13.200
Oh, tonight, it's the dining
and reclining room.

14:13.243 --> 14:15.855
Whoa, pretzel-y milk
and lumbar support.

14:15.898 --> 14:17.117
But wait.
There's more.

14:17.160 --> 14:19.728
Please welcome Lee
of Lee's Hoagies.

14:19.771 --> 14:22.078
And for our final
special guest of the night,

14:22.122 --> 14:24.689
someone my husband
has admired for years,

14:24.733 --> 14:27.301
the Phillie Phanatic!

14:28.476 --> 14:30.391
Oh!

14:30.434 --> 14:32.915
The San Diego Chicken's
mortal enemy.

14:32.959 --> 14:35.135
You've done it again,
Beverly.

14:35.178 --> 14:37.006
You know what, Mom?
This is crazy,

14:37.050 --> 14:38.616
and not in your usual
clinical way.

14:38.660 --> 14:40.923
Aww.
Honestly, Dad is
gonna love this.

14:40.967 --> 14:43.752
Well, after I asked you fools
what Murray would like,

14:43.795 --> 14:47.147
I realized
nobody knows that man
better than me,

14:47.190 --> 14:49.236
his perfect wife
with the beautiful
hair and skin.

14:49.279 --> 14:50.672
Oh, Dad's walking
up the driveway.

14:50.715 --> 14:52.456
Oh. Uh, okay.

14:52.500 --> 14:54.110
Everybody, shut up!

14:54.154 --> 14:55.807
Shut up.
Shut your faces.

14:55.851 --> 14:57.157
Even you,
Phillie Phanatic.

14:57.200 --> 14:58.288
Beverly, I don't think
he has a working mouth.

15:00.290 --> 15:03.206
ALL: Surprise!

15:03.250 --> 15:04.468
ADULT ADAM: In that moment,

15:04.512 --> 15:06.470
my Dad took in
everything my mom did

15:06.514 --> 15:08.908
to make
his birthday redo perfect,

15:08.951 --> 15:11.345
and all he did was this.

15:14.522 --> 15:15.958
Why, Chime Guy?

15:16.002 --> 15:18.395
While my mom's party
was a bust,

15:18.439 --> 15:21.050
I was ready to bust some moves on the pickleball court.

15:21.094 --> 15:22.356
PRINCIPAL BALL:
Well, well, well.

15:22.399 --> 15:24.488
Look who heard the siren song
of the pickle

15:24.532 --> 15:25.707
and came
running back home.

15:25.750 --> 15:27.100
Mr. March.

15:27.143 --> 15:28.623
In the flesh.

15:28.666 --> 15:31.017
Is your protege ready
to bring that hot dill?

15:31.060 --> 15:32.453
All that stands
in the way

15:32.496 --> 15:34.411
of a letterman jacket
and film school

15:34.455 --> 15:36.718
is chopping a backspin
to the baseline.

15:36.761 --> 15:38.459
I hope you play
as smooth as you talk.

15:38.502 --> 15:39.242
Schernecke!

15:41.766 --> 15:44.508
Goldberg,
you beat our worst player,
you're on the team.

15:44.552 --> 15:46.989
Wait.
I'm our worst player?

15:47.033 --> 15:48.817
Sorry you had
to hear it this way,

15:48.860 --> 15:50.993
but glad we don't have to
tiptoe around it anymore.
Go get 'em.

15:51.037 --> 15:52.603
ADULT ADAM: This was it.

15:52.647 --> 15:54.692
My pickleball journey
may have been days
in the making,

15:54.736 --> 15:56.085
but thanks to my training,

15:56.129 --> 15:58.000
there was no way I wouldn't
dominate the court.

16:01.090 --> 16:02.309
And I did.
COACH MELLOR: Yeah!

16:02.352 --> 16:03.571
Sports was easy...

16:03.614 --> 16:05.355
Until it wasn't.

16:05.399 --> 16:07.618
Turns out, that point
would be my only one.

16:07.662 --> 16:09.011
Try again.
Try again.

16:09.055 --> 16:11.231
Yep, that day on
the pickleball court,

16:11.274 --> 16:14.364
Matt Schernecke sliced
and served me up hard.

16:14.408 --> 16:16.976
Okay, it's 20-1.
I think it's safe
to call it.

16:17.019 --> 16:18.673
Terrible effort,
Goldberg.

16:18.716 --> 16:20.718
Yes!
I'm still the worst.

16:20.762 --> 16:22.285
Oh.

16:22.329 --> 16:24.461
Damn it! Now I'll never
get into film school.

16:24.505 --> 16:27.725
I just say that
to get folks interested
in joining the team.

16:27.769 --> 16:31.555
Your future as a filmmaker
still may or may not happen.

16:31.599 --> 16:33.688
That was
hard to watch.

16:35.081 --> 16:36.473
So, this was all
for nothing?

16:36.517 --> 16:38.127
Not nothing.

16:38.171 --> 16:39.737
You proved beyond
a shadow of a doubt

16:39.781 --> 16:40.869
that I'm not a coach
anymore.

16:42.044 --> 16:43.219
I'm just a man.

16:43.263 --> 16:45.482
A man who has to go
to a special gym

16:45.526 --> 16:48.050
to find heavy enough
weights to lift.

16:48.094 --> 16:49.182
But still just a man.

16:58.539 --> 16:59.931
ADULT ADAM:
I'd failed at pickleball,

16:59.975 --> 17:01.977
but I couldn't let
Coach Mellor think
that he failed me.

17:02.021 --> 17:03.413
What are you doing?

17:03.457 --> 17:06.503
Just sodding over
a beautiful pickleball court.

17:06.547 --> 17:08.201
Thinking about putting
some azaleas right there,

17:08.244 --> 17:10.986
maybe a lovely
crushed-stone path
where you're standing.

17:11.030 --> 17:13.902
So long forever,
my special pickle.

17:13.945 --> 17:15.991
I know this is a big blow,

17:16.035 --> 17:19.473
but this yard is gonna be
a charming outdoor area
for entertaining.

17:19.516 --> 17:20.822
Just say your piece.

17:20.865 --> 17:22.780
I wanted to stop by
and say thanks.

17:22.824 --> 17:24.478
Thanks for what?
You didn't make the team.

17:24.521 --> 17:25.348
Yeah.

17:26.654 --> 17:27.872
But you never gave up on me.

17:29.048 --> 17:31.311
I-I know you don't
feel like a coach,

17:31.354 --> 17:32.834
but I still think
you're one of the best.

17:32.877 --> 17:34.401
Yeah.

17:34.444 --> 17:36.272
Truth be told,
it was kinda nice
getting out there.

17:36.316 --> 17:38.840
Well, you should know,
letterman jacket or not,

17:38.883 --> 17:40.320
you've always
inspired me.

17:42.104 --> 17:44.846
And you'll always
be my coach.

17:44.889 --> 17:48.197
Damn it, Goldberg,
you know absolutely nothing
about physical fitness,

17:48.241 --> 17:50.417
but you always seem to be able
to give my heart a workout.

17:55.161 --> 17:56.553
W-What's this for?

17:56.597 --> 17:58.381
Well, as far
as I'm concerned,

17:58.425 --> 18:00.340
you'll always be first string
on the team of life.

18:00.383 --> 18:01.732
That's not a thing.

18:01.776 --> 18:02.994
Just put it on.

18:05.519 --> 18:07.477
Now, bring it in
for a standing dog pile.

18:12.134 --> 18:15.442
ADULT ADAM:
With that, I finally got
my letterman jacket.

18:15.485 --> 18:17.400
As for Coach Mellor,
he was finally thinking

18:17.444 --> 18:19.489
about getting
back in the game.

18:21.622 --> 18:24.277
The thing is, when you
make peace with your past,

18:24.320 --> 18:25.800
your future is wide open.

18:25.843 --> 18:27.802
I'm sorry, Murray.

18:27.845 --> 18:30.109
You said you didn't
want a party,
and I didn't listen.

18:30.152 --> 18:31.327
I-It wasn't that.

18:33.634 --> 18:35.070
It was perfect.

18:35.114 --> 18:36.941
You liked it?

18:36.985 --> 18:39.901
Yeah, all those people,
everything you did for me,
I loved it.

18:39.944 --> 18:41.685
Then why
are you in here?

18:41.729 --> 18:43.383
Oh, geez.

18:44.035 --> 18:46.299
Oh.

18:46.342 --> 18:48.388
My dad never cared
about my birthday,

18:48.431 --> 18:50.303
so...

18:50.346 --> 18:51.782
I tried not to care.

18:51.826 --> 18:54.089
But tonight,

18:54.133 --> 18:56.004
I realized
how much I missed.

18:56.613 --> 18:58.006
Oh, Murray.

18:58.049 --> 18:59.660
Nah, it's a good thing.

18:59.703 --> 19:04.143
I may have
not had a great dad
or a great childhood,

19:04.186 --> 19:07.189
but I have a great wife
and a great life now.

19:09.931 --> 19:11.976
Well, you know what
the best part about
this whole thing is?

19:12.020 --> 19:13.413
I saw hoagies
down there.

19:15.284 --> 19:17.721
You're a whole year younger
than you thought you were.

19:17.765 --> 19:20.071
And even better,
I get an extra
year with you.

ADULT ADAM: Sometimes,
if you're lucky enough,

19:23.640 --> 19:25.425
life gives you
a second chance.

19:25.468 --> 19:28.036
It might not happen the way
you thought it would,

19:28.079 --> 19:31.735

you'll find the biggest wins
