<i>Previously on</i> Ghost...

00:30.398 --> 00:31.432
Evelyn.

00:31.432 --> 00:34.402
Frank was on his way
to surprise you.

00:34.402 --> 00:36.036
To make your family
whole again.

00:36.036 --> 00:38.406
Brayden needs to learn
the family business.

00:38.406 --> 00:40.141
<i>You're gonna
be working with KeKe Travis.</i>

00:40.141 --> 00:41.142
My pleasure.

00:41.142 --> 00:42.410
Yeah, I've heard
a lot about you.

00:42.410 --> 00:43.677
By not fuckin' with Tariq,
you're saving yourself

00:43.677 --> 00:45.446
<i>a lot of grief, trust me.</i>

00:45.446 --> 00:47.248
<i>You have enough
clout to get authorization</i>

00:47.248 --> 00:49.683
for a joint federal
and local task force?

00:49.683 --> 00:50.751
I could try.

00:50.751 --> 00:52.753
That was taken
from a traffic cam

00:52.753 --> 00:54.455
the night of Carrie's suicide,

00:54.455 --> 00:56.390
and it's just blocks
from her apartment.

00:56.390 --> 00:59.059
You are not authorized
to investigate Monet Tejada.

00:59.059 --> 01:00.194
Is that understood?

01:00.194 --> 01:01.395
<i>Mecca.</i>

01:01.395 --> 01:02.663
<i>Where the fuck
you think you're going?</i>

01:02.663 --> 01:05.266
Ah!

01:05.266 --> 01:06.767
- Hey!
- Cut me some slack--

01:06.767 --> 01:09.069
I'll cut you some fuckin' slack
when I put a bullet

01:09.069 --> 01:10.538
in whoever took Zeke
away from me.

01:10.538 --> 01:12.473
- Fuck, you go here now?
- Yep.

01:12.473 --> 01:13.474
Monet know?

01:15.075 --> 01:16.577
Get on your knees.

01:16.577 --> 01:18.312
<i>Mecca was my First Lieutenant.</i>

01:18.312 --> 01:20.514
His drugs belong to me.

01:20.514 --> 01:21.782
We can keep
the cash flow going.

01:21.782 --> 01:23.217
You think you can
replace Mecca?

01:23.217 --> 01:24.518
Of course we can.

01:24.518 --> 01:25.586
Who is this bitch?

01:25.586 --> 01:26.787
All I got is a name, Noma.

01:26.787 --> 01:28.389
From now on,
I'ma be working for her--

01:28.389 --> 01:29.557
me, Cane, and Brayden,

01:29.557 --> 01:31.125
or else she gonna kill
all three of us.

01:31.125 --> 01:33.127
- Get the fuck in the car.
- No, please.

01:34.261 --> 01:35.463
<i>We have blood on our hands.</i>

01:35.463 --> 01:37.832

Hey.

03:33.948 --> 03:35.616
Where am I?

03:35.616 --> 03:36.817
You're at the hospital, Lauren.

03:36.817 --> 03:38.385
There was a...

03:38.385 --> 03:39.520
an incident.

03:43.524 --> 03:45.292
You were hit pretty hard.

03:45.292 --> 03:46.560
The doctor said
it might take some time

03:46.560 --> 03:48.262
for you to regain memory
of the night,

03:48.262 --> 03:50.731
<i>but best we can assemble,</i>

03:50.731 --> 03:52.566
<i>you were knocked unconscious,</i>

03:52.566 --> 03:53.834
<i>placed in a vehicle,</i>

03:53.834 --> 03:55.903
<i>and driven out of the city,</i>

03:55.903 --> 03:57.905
<i>then pushed
into the reservoir.</i>

03:59.573 --> 04:01.542
<i>We don't know by who.</i>

04:01.542 --> 04:02.843
<i>The car was reported stolen,</i>

04:02.843 --> 04:05.779
<i>but there's no clues
leading to the thief.</i>

04:05.779 --> 04:08.349
<i>Whoever was behind this
had it all planned out</i>

04:08.349 --> 04:09.883
<i>and was pretty meticulous.</i>

04:11.251 --> 04:12.486
<i>But you got really lucky.</i>

04:13.687 --> 04:14.989
<i>A man was out walking his dog</i>

04:14.989 --> 04:17.891
<i>and happened to see you
going into the water.</i>

04:17.891 --> 04:20.928
<i>If he hadn't called 911,</i>

04:20.928 --> 04:23.998
<i>tonight would've played out
very differently.</i>

04:38.379 --> 04:39.947
Hey. How you doing?

04:39.947 --> 04:42.383
I brought you some things.

04:42.383 --> 04:43.851
It's not the Internet, but--

04:43.851 --> 04:45.853
Look, I need to see my parents.

04:47.388 --> 04:48.555
Or a phone call.

04:48.555 --> 04:51.325
Jenny, seriously,
anything, please.

04:52.826 --> 04:55.462
We've been over this, Lauren.

04:55.462 --> 04:56.830
Your parents think you're dead,

04:56.830 --> 04:59.600
<i>as does everyone else
except for my supervisor</i>

04:59.600 --> 05:01.435
and your doctor.

05:01.435 --> 05:03.704
It's the only way to guarantee
your safety and theirs

05:03.704 --> 05:04.938
while I build my case.

05:04.938 --> 05:06.540
And what case is that?

05:06.540 --> 05:07.708
I literally told you
who did it,

05:07.708 --> 05:09.043
so go arrest her.

05:09.043 --> 05:12.012
Lauren, the dog walker didn't
see anyone that night,

05:12.012 --> 05:13.981
and by your own admission,
you were unconscious

05:13.981 --> 05:15.482
when you were placed
in that car,

05:15.482 --> 05:17.618
so you can't know for certain
what really happened.

05:17.618 --> 05:19.787
Okay, but I do know
what happened.

05:19.787 --> 05:22.356
That girl Effie,
she tried to kill me.

05:22.356 --> 05:23.490
I believe you.

05:23.490 --> 05:24.925
I do, but right now,

05:24.925 --> 05:27.561
I do not have a single shred
of hard evidence to go on.

05:29.797 --> 05:31.999
So I need you to help me
with something.

05:31.999 --> 05:33.434
No.

05:33.434 --> 05:34.735
No!

05:34.735 --> 05:36.770
Literally every time
one of you guys has said that,

05:36.770 --> 05:38.706
my life has gotten
exponentially more fucked up.

05:38.706 --> 05:41.442
Okay, closing this case
is the only way

05:41.442 --> 05:43.610
to get you out of here
and on with your life.

05:44.611 --> 05:46.580
Now, given the fact pattern,
it stands to reason

05:46.580 --> 05:47.981
that Effie wasn't working alone,

05:47.981 --> 05:50.851
and by connecting those dots
between her and what I suspect

05:50.851 --> 05:54.054
to be a much bigger
drug organization,

05:54.054 --> 05:55.923
is the best way to get us all
what we want.

05:57.357 --> 05:59.393
So she was working
with Brayden?

05:59.393 --> 06:00.561
I told you that already.

06:01.895 --> 06:04.698
The focus of our investigation
is above Brayden.

06:10.704 --> 06:12.906
Tariq St. Patrick
is the clearest

06:12.906 --> 06:15.642
connective tissue between them.

06:19.613 --> 06:21.415
I don't have any proof
that Tariq was working

06:21.415 --> 06:23.450
with Brayden and Effie.

06:25.519 --> 06:27.755
And clearly, neither do you.

06:27.755 --> 06:29.923
Well, until I can get
an airtight case

06:29.923 --> 06:31.959
against all of those responsible

06:31.959 --> 06:33.961
for trying to kill you,

06:33.961 --> 06:36.930
the fact that Tariq, Effie,
Brayden, the Tejadas

06:36.930 --> 06:39.066
all believe that their attempt
succeeded is the only thing

06:39.066 --> 06:43.137
keeping you and your family
alive right now.

06:43.137 --> 06:44.705
Trust me.

06:54.448 --> 06:56.183
I can't believe Noma's in Paris

06:56.416 --> 06:59.153
and I'm stuck here babysitting
you tiresome Americans.

06:59.153 --> 07:00.788
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

07:00.788 --> 07:02.122
It's good to see you too.

07:03.924 --> 07:05.893
I told her she was insane

07:05.893 --> 07:07.895
for giving you
this opportunity.

07:07.895 --> 07:09.763
You will only squander it.

07:09.763 --> 07:11.431
I mean, it's pretty evident
that your words

07:11.431 --> 07:12.866
don't mean much to her.

07:14.501 --> 07:16.069
I'm particularly
looking forward

07:16.069 --> 07:18.705
to shooting you when you fail.

07:18.705 --> 07:20.007
<i>♪ Uh, whoo, step up ♪</i>

07:20.007 --> 07:21.642
Idiot.

07:25.546 --> 07:26.980
Not gonna lie,
I think he fucks with us.

07:26.980 --> 07:28.582
Nah, that nigga wants
to kill you.

07:28.582 --> 07:30.851
All right, party people,
well, the clock is ticking,

07:30.851 --> 07:34.721
and these babies are ready
to go to their forever homes.

07:34.721 --> 07:35.989
Yo, who these niggas
over there, Cane?

07:35.989 --> 07:38.625
Hired some of the Jamaica Ave
Boys to help.

07:38.625 --> 07:39.827
What's up?

07:41.228 --> 07:43.130
Are we doing this or what?
I have class in a hour.

07:43.130 --> 07:44.932
Yeah, and I gotta go analyze
some stocks,

07:44.932 --> 07:46.967
which should definitely
be more fun than cocaine.

07:48.202 --> 07:49.837
Cane, your family flooding
the streets, right?

07:49.837 --> 07:51.672
Yeah, I got these niggas start
moving shit today

07:51.672 --> 07:53.574
while Dru and Lorenzo expand
our footprint.

07:53.574 --> 07:56.610
A'ight. Me and Effie,
we gonna hit the Ivies up

07:56.610 --> 07:57.911
while Stansfield cools down.

07:57.911 --> 08:00.013
Shit's too hot on campus,
and with CourseCorrect dead,

08:00.013 --> 08:01.648
<i>Stansfield's off-limits.</i>

08:01.648 --> 08:04.051
B, you take care of the country
clubs, alumni clubs--

08:04.051 --> 08:06.186
Basically anywhere rich white
people do what we're doing,

08:06.186 --> 08:07.654
but we get locked up for it.

08:07.654 --> 08:09.656
Guys, I think we're overlooking
a sick market.

08:09.656 --> 08:12.693
The traders at Weston Holdings
would eat this shit up. 'Riq--

08:12.693 --> 08:13.961
Get the fuck out of here.
Are you dumb?

08:15.229 --> 08:16.897
Nigga, you just told
the whole fucking world

08:16.897 --> 08:18.065
you sell drugs.

08:18.065 --> 08:19.233
You hotter than Stansfield
right now.

08:19.233 --> 08:20.901
We're not selling shit
anywhere near

08:20.901 --> 08:22.269
where your name has anything
to do with it.

08:22.502 --> 08:24.571
I know.
Hear me out.

08:26.807 --> 08:29.076
You trust them with our shit?

08:29.076 --> 08:31.178
These niggas know
not to get greedy

08:31.178 --> 08:33.814
and what'll happen if they do.

08:39.019 --> 08:41.054
Yo, that is a fuck-ton
of weight,

08:41.054 --> 08:42.923
and the dick-swingers
at my office would pay enough

08:42.923 --> 08:44.825
to buy us
every-day-of-the-week Lambos.

08:44.825 --> 08:47.861
I'm talking the Urus.
I'm talking the SVJ.

08:47.861 --> 08:49.196
Back me up, Effie.

08:49.196 --> 08:50.197
Fuck no.

08:50.197 --> 08:52.633
She's right, man.
Fuck that shit.

08:52.633 --> 08:54.234
Listen, we're not doing
no business

08:54.234 --> 08:55.702
anywhere near
your family's companies

08:55.702 --> 08:56.837
or anything that has your name
attached to it.

08:56.837 --> 08:57.838
It ain't worth the risk.

08:57.838 --> 08:58.906
There's no risk.

08:58.906 --> 09:00.540
I mean, maybe for you.

09:00.540 --> 09:02.776
Listen, man, you just admitted
to being a whole drug dealer,

09:02.776 --> 09:04.711
and your punishment
was a six-figure income.

09:04.711 --> 09:06.046
I didn't admit to shit,
and yet somehow,

09:06.046 --> 09:08.015
I lose housing, and I'm still
doing damage control.

09:08.015 --> 09:09.249
The fuck?

09:09.249 --> 09:10.250
You're right,
that is fucked up.

09:10.250 --> 09:11.685
I'm sorry, 'Riq.

09:11.685 --> 09:13.053
You got a room, though, right?

09:13.053 --> 09:14.655
Yeah, Tate helped me out,
hooked me up

09:14.655 --> 09:16.089
with a little internship
on his campaign.

09:16.089 --> 09:17.791
How's that gonna help
your image?

09:17.791 --> 09:19.159
Tate's dirty as fuck.

09:19.159 --> 09:20.694
He's the right kind
of dirty, though.

09:21.929 --> 09:24.197
All right, well,
go get that political shine.

09:24.197 --> 09:25.599
I'll catch you later.

09:25.599 --> 09:27.000
Later, Eff.

09:32.673 --> 09:35.208
I could take the drive up to
Princeton with you if you want.

09:36.109 --> 09:38.145
Actually, it'll just be quicker
if I go on my own.

09:39.880 --> 09:41.682
What's up with you? You good?

09:41.682 --> 09:43.150
"Day-of-the-week Lambos"?

09:43.150 --> 09:44.251
Come on, you know
he's fucking around.

09:44.251 --> 09:45.619
- That's Brayden.
- Wh-whatever.

09:45.619 --> 09:46.853
I don't give a shit
if y'all splurge,

09:46.853 --> 09:48.188
but the longer we stand here,
the more interest

09:48.188 --> 09:50.791
accrues on my student loans.

09:50.791 --> 09:52.159
Don't forget, Tariq, some of us

09:52.159 --> 09:54.127
are only doing this
because we have to.

09:54.127 --> 09:57.864
Wait, so you think I'm here
because I want to be, Effie?

09:57.864 --> 10:00.100
Listen, if we don't move all
of that shit in that warehouse,

10:00.100 --> 10:01.935
Noma's gonna kill
all of our asses.

10:03.937 --> 10:05.172
Yeah.

10:06.907 --> 10:08.375
Better get moving then.

10:11.044 --> 10:12.779
<i>Plaintiff Yung Joc says he performed...</i>

10:12.779 --> 10:14.614
Mrs. Tejada.

10:16.116 --> 10:18.085
I got that investigation file
you wanted.

10:18.085 --> 10:19.953
It's about time.

10:19.953 --> 10:21.655
What do they know?

10:21.655 --> 10:23.323
Well, not what you want.

10:23.323 --> 10:25.892
There's a lot going on,
but no real leads.

10:25.892 --> 10:27.194
Since Zeke was killed
the same night

10:27.194 --> 10:29.296
as his father
in Spears' hangar,

10:29.296 --> 10:30.831
they're looking
into the possibility

10:30.831 --> 10:33.266
they were targeted
by the same doer.

10:33.266 --> 10:34.768
Who do they think that was?

10:34.768 --> 10:38.238
Eh, I'd say your guess
is as good as theirs.

10:38.238 --> 10:40.374
They logged .45 caliber
shell casings,

10:40.374 --> 10:41.975
but that's a long shot at best.

10:41.975 --> 10:43.243
Partial prints led nowhere.

10:43.243 --> 10:45.145
Any potential witnesses
scattered like rats,

10:45.145 --> 10:47.314
and that's all she wrote.

10:48.949 --> 10:50.317
Shit.

10:50.317 --> 10:52.352
The fuck it is. I need more.

10:52.352 --> 10:53.854
Mrs. Tejada--Monet--

10:53.854 --> 10:55.122
Mrs. Tejada works.

10:55.956 --> 10:58.425
Okay, Mrs. Tejada...

10:58.658 --> 11:01.828
...that's the NYPD's
entire file on the case.

11:01.828 --> 11:03.797
There's nothing more to get.

11:03.797 --> 11:06.700
Whoever did this is either
meticulous or chaotic enough

11:06.700 --> 11:10.037
to have New York's finest
scratching their head.

11:10.037 --> 11:14.441
Well, Davis, it's time to start
earning your damn money.

11:14.674 --> 11:15.675
Someone killed my son,

11:15.675 --> 11:16.777
and ain't nobody
gonna fucking rest

11:16.777 --> 11:18.145
<i>until I find out who.</i>

11:22.682 --> 11:24.051
Here you go.

11:25.886 --> 11:27.120
Subtle, Cooper.

11:27.120 --> 11:30.323
Well, I told them Saxe,
but you know how it goes.

11:30.323 --> 11:33.760
I think they do it on purpose
because I'm so sexy.

11:35.395 --> 11:37.297
I called you last night.
Where were you?

11:37.297 --> 11:40.033
I was working at the office

11:40.033 --> 11:43.303
and waiting for my CI to get me
something I can actually use.

11:43.303 --> 11:46.006
Oh, come on. I'm working on it.

11:46.006 --> 11:48.008
You have any luck getting
an unredacted version

11:48.008 --> 11:49.943
of that Theo Rollins file?

11:49.943 --> 11:51.845
Not yet. It's, um,

11:51.845 --> 11:53.280
more complicated
than it should be.

11:53.280 --> 11:56.249
Pulling a file is complicated?

11:57.117 --> 11:58.318
It'll raise a red flag

11:58.318 --> 12:00.253
if I put in this request
out of nowhere,

12:00.253 --> 12:02.456
and I don't need anybody
looking at me sideways

12:02.456 --> 12:04.758
while I'm trying to get a RICO
task force off the ground.

12:04.758 --> 12:06.259
Whoa.

12:06.259 --> 12:08.195
Isn't it a little early
for that?

12:10.030 --> 12:11.198
Isn't it a little early for you

12:11.198 --> 12:13.733
to be showing up
at my apartment unannounced?

12:13.733 --> 12:15.135
I mean, I wouldn't even
be here right now

12:15.135 --> 12:18.905
if I didn't have
to come back for this.

12:20.807 --> 12:23.877
Your little Nancy Drew game
isn't getting me very far.

12:23.877 --> 12:26.113
An official task force will
give me more resources

12:26.113 --> 12:27.981
so I can cast a wider net.

12:27.981 --> 12:29.149
Well, yeah, of course,

12:29.149 --> 12:31.852
but how are you ever
gonna get that approved?

12:31.852 --> 12:34.955
Tariq St. Patrick is guilty
of a lot of things,

12:34.955 --> 12:36.890
but pinning
an entire drug organization

12:36.890 --> 12:40.360
on a 19-year-old kid is gonna
be a tough sell, even for you.

12:40.360 --> 12:42.762
He's not just any kid.

12:42.762 --> 12:44.764
Look at who his parents were.

12:44.764 --> 12:45.966
Tariq was groomed for this.

12:45.966 --> 12:47.400
You think anyone was surprised

12:47.400 --> 12:49.970
LeBron's kid could dunk
a basketball?

12:49.970 --> 12:51.338
Um, no,

12:51.338 --> 12:54.040
and I think
that's a little racist.

12:55.275 --> 12:57.210
Look, you said you could
bring me something

12:57.210 --> 13:00.380
that I can work with, so...

13:00.380 --> 13:02.382
show me what you got, Saxe.

13:03.550 --> 13:05.418
Show me...

13:05.418 --> 13:08.355
you're really the man
you said you could be.

13:17.097 --> 13:19.266
Oh, what the actual fuck?

13:19.266 --> 13:21.434
Chad, so sorry
to interrupt your nap.

13:21.434 --> 13:23.336
You were supposed to proofread
these reports yesterday.

13:23.336 --> 13:25.172
- Okay.
- We need them now.

13:25.172 --> 13:27.174
Chill...

13:27.174 --> 13:28.875
Omarosa.

13:30.010 --> 13:31.244
Excuse me?

13:31.244 --> 13:33.480
Dude, that's fucked up.
Just fucking do it.

13:40.987 --> 13:42.222
He's a fucking dick.

13:42.222 --> 13:43.356
Do you want me to go to HR?

13:43.356 --> 13:44.858
For that? No.

13:44.858 --> 13:47.294
God, I just can't stand
these trust fund interns,

13:47.294 --> 13:48.461
you know, messing with my paper

13:48.461 --> 13:50.530
'cause they've never had
to earn their own.

13:50.530 --> 13:53.300
He was probably dreaming about
a Proud Boy rally or some shit.

13:55.235 --> 13:57.070
Hold up.

13:57.070 --> 13:58.471
You think we need
to make America great again?

13:58.471 --> 13:59.539
Fuck no.

13:59.539 --> 14:00.874
Those assholes are the ones

14:00.874 --> 14:02.142
who fucked it up
in the first place.

14:03.610 --> 14:05.312
Okay...

14:05.312 --> 14:07.147
Baby Weston.

14:22.028 --> 14:24.331
<i>Got the Smiths.</i>

14:24.331 --> 14:26.566
Jones, Osborne--
okay, make sure

14:26.566 --> 14:28.168
that the email blast goes out

14:28.168 --> 14:30.237
to all of the updated lists,
all right?

14:30.237 --> 14:31.338
- Yes, sir.
- Um...

14:31.338 --> 14:33.173
we gotta make sure that, uh--

14:35.175 --> 14:37.077
- All right, thank you.
- I'm on it.

14:37.077 --> 14:39.646
Steven Ott, to what
do I owe the pleasure?

14:39.879 --> 14:40.947
Well, it's good
to see you're not

14:40.947 --> 14:42.182
overspending on office space.

14:42.182 --> 14:44.351
Jesus, what a shithole.

14:44.351 --> 14:46.653
All right, look, I hate to be
the bearer of bad news, Rashad,

14:46.886 --> 14:49.923
but your poll numbers,
they suck.

14:49.923 --> 14:51.358
You're getting trounced.

14:51.358 --> 14:53.059
If you want to win
this congressional seat,

14:53.059 --> 14:54.928
you're gonna have to fire off
some ads.

14:54.928 --> 14:57.097
Yes, well, to do that
we would need resources,

14:57.097 --> 14:58.298
now, wouldn't we?

14:58.298 --> 15:01.268
Listen, it seems
as though that, uh,

15:01.268 --> 15:03.136
your good friend Rick Sweeney
hasn't gone

15:03.136 --> 15:04.971
as quietly into the night
as we'd hoped.

15:04.971 --> 15:06.906
Apparently,
he's funneling donors

15:06.906 --> 15:08.241
over to the fucking competition.

15:08.241 --> 15:10.410
Yeah,
that's a tough break there.

15:10.410 --> 15:11.678
Look, we all thought AOC was

15:11.911 --> 15:13.513
a once-in-a-generation
candidate,

15:13.513 --> 15:15.048
but the movement just
keeps fucking growing--

15:15.048 --> 15:17.150
Listen, I know, but nothing
has been decided yet, okay?

15:17.150 --> 15:18.952
That's right. That's right.

15:18.952 --> 15:21.021
We need to bring some fresh
blood in here, you know,

15:21.021 --> 15:23.390
mobilize young voters,
bring in that cha-ching.

15:23.390 --> 15:25.358
Already ahead of you.
I have a fantastic

15:25.358 --> 15:27.227
new intern starting today.

15:27.227 --> 15:29.195
Well, I hope they can hustle.

15:29.195 --> 15:31.031
Oh, one more thing.

15:31.031 --> 15:32.699
There's also the problem
of your conspicuous

15:32.932 --> 15:34.000
lack of a wife.

15:34.000 --> 15:35.435
- Fix it.
- I'm already working on it.

15:35.435 --> 15:37.504
I have several candidates
in the mix.

15:37.504 --> 15:40.507
Ah, I'm so glad to hear it.
Just not the intern, all right?

15:41.574 --> 15:43.610
Bye, Rashad!

15:43.610 --> 15:45.111
Steven.

15:49.549 --> 15:52.185
Gandhi said,
"The Earth provides enough

15:52.185 --> 15:56.189
to satisfy every man's needs,
but not every man's greed."

15:56.189 --> 15:58.491
So my question for you is,
in this nation

15:58.491 --> 16:00.593
of haves versus have-nots
that worship

16:00.593 --> 16:02.462
at the church of capitalism,

16:02.462 --> 16:06.199
what is the line
between need and greed?

16:06.199 --> 16:09.035
My man Gandhi said that shit
way before climate change

16:09.035 --> 16:10.737
and overpopulation started
popping off.

16:10.970 --> 16:14.541
BruShaundria's right, and with
increasingly limited resources,

16:14.541 --> 16:17.143
making sure you have
as much as possible for you

16:17.143 --> 16:19.679
and your family is need--
nothing greedy about it.

16:19.679 --> 16:23.216
Well, what about our moral
obligations to other humans?

16:23.216 --> 16:24.584
What about
corporate responsibility?

16:24.584 --> 16:26.453
"When morality comes up
against profit,

16:26.453 --> 16:27.721
it's seldom profit that loses."

16:27.721 --> 16:30.557
Ah, Shirley Chisholm.

16:30.557 --> 16:32.759
Nice pull, Ms. Morales.

16:32.992 --> 16:34.594
Now, do you agree with her?

16:34.594 --> 16:37.597
Mm. Not that it's right,
but that it's fact, yeah.

16:37.597 --> 16:39.532
Life is kill or be killed.

16:39.532 --> 16:41.368
Same goes for America.

16:41.368 --> 16:43.436
Greed is just another word
for growth.

16:43.436 --> 16:45.372
The bigger you get,
the more you have.

16:45.372 --> 16:47.173
The more you have,
the more you need.

16:47.173 --> 16:48.575
It's the law of nature.

16:48.575 --> 16:50.110
I should point out,

16:50.110 --> 16:52.712
that's also the philosophy
of a cancer cell.

16:52.712 --> 16:54.481
<i>Whoa.</i>

16:54.481 --> 16:56.783
<i>Are you seriously
comparing America with cancer?</i>

16:57.016 --> 16:58.752
Hey. You need these?

16:58.752 --> 17:00.019
It's okay.

17:00.019 --> 17:01.554
I already did the reading online.

17:01.554 --> 17:04.124
But girl, why the fuck
are those books so expensive?

17:04.124 --> 17:06.459
I can't afford to buy that shit
for all my classes.

17:06.459 --> 17:08.595
Yeah, I know. I've been there.

17:08.595 --> 17:10.463
You know, I hear
the TAs sometimes keep a set

17:10.463 --> 17:12.098
for students to use.

17:14.033 --> 17:15.301
<i>Listen, since
you had something to say,</i>

17:15.301 --> 17:17.070
<i>you stand up.
Tell me what you think.</i>

17:17.070 --> 17:19.038
<i>Go on, tell me what you think
the other view is.</i>

17:20.407 --> 17:21.574
<i>Nice tie, Phil.</i>

17:21.574 --> 17:24.077
I think my great-grandfather
had the same one.

17:24.077 --> 17:25.278
Eat shit, Chad.

17:28.047 --> 17:30.250
That's him.

17:30.250 --> 17:31.284
What the hell's going on?

17:31.284 --> 17:33.420
Compliance found
incendiary content

17:33.420 --> 17:35.288
on your computer.

17:35.288 --> 17:37.123
We're gonna need you
to collect your things.

17:37.123 --> 17:38.491
What?

17:38.491 --> 17:40.126
That's impossible. Show me.

17:40.126 --> 17:43.062
It's the kind of stuff
that goes along with these...

17:44.197 --> 17:46.399
...which were found
in your desk.

17:46.399 --> 17:48.835
We have zero tolerance
for propagating

17:49.068 --> 17:51.304
alt-right bullshit
here in the office.

17:52.405 --> 17:53.573
You need to leave immediately.

17:53.573 --> 17:54.774
That's not fucking mine,

17:54.774 --> 17:56.242
so this is some kind of setup.

17:56.242 --> 17:57.477
Get your hands off of me.

17:57.477 --> 17:59.279
- Sir, let's go.
- Oh...

17:59.279 --> 18:02.715
my dad is gonna sue
your asses so hard,

18:02.715 --> 18:06.152
you are gonna shit
from your esophagus.

18:06.152 --> 18:08.755
I'll see you bitches in court,

18:08.755 --> 18:10.857
all right?

18:14.093 --> 18:15.495
- That you?
- Uh-huh.

18:15.495 --> 18:17.330
Hmm.

18:17.330 --> 18:19.332
Come.

18:22.335 --> 18:24.871
That tiki torch
was fucking extra as hell,

18:25.104 --> 18:26.673
but I loved it.

18:26.673 --> 18:29.209
Where did you get that
in the middle of Manhattan?

18:29.209 --> 18:32.378
You can Postmates
fucking anything.

18:32.378 --> 18:35.114
Well, I hope you didn't use
the company card.

18:40.887 --> 18:42.288
Where are we?

18:42.288 --> 18:43.389
A private floor.

18:43.389 --> 18:44.557
Supposedly there's more,

18:44.557 --> 18:46.125
but it's the only one
I have the code for.

18:46.125 --> 18:47.627
There's more?

18:47.627 --> 18:49.596
<i>♪ Real good time ♪</i>

18:49.596 --> 18:50.864
Look around, Trust Fund.

18:50.864 --> 18:53.266
Everything the light touches
is yours.

18:53.266 --> 18:54.267
Shit, your name's
on the building.

18:54.267 --> 18:55.401
You really didn't know?

18:55.401 --> 18:57.403
My grandfather's name's
on the building.

18:57.403 --> 18:59.205
Well, I wish I had
your grandpa.

18:59.205 --> 19:01.241
If you did, then this would
be super awkward.

19:02.742 --> 19:03.843
But no, you don't.

19:03.843 --> 19:05.745
He was a miserable
piece of shit.

19:05.745 --> 19:07.847
Walking example
of money doesn't buy happiness.

19:10.183 --> 19:12.452
Yeah, well, that's only true
for people who don't need it.

19:12.452 --> 19:15.154
You give me money,
I'll show you happiness.

19:15.154 --> 19:16.356
I'm sorry, but trust me,

19:16.356 --> 19:18.391
this shit comes with its own
set of handcuffs.

19:18.391 --> 19:21.661
Okay, Brayden Weston...

19:21.661 --> 19:24.597
then what exactly would
make you happy?

19:24.597 --> 19:27.734
<i>♪ Trust me
We a real good time ♪</i>

19:27.734 --> 19:29.702
I mean, do you want
to talk about that?

19:29.702 --> 19:32.272
Or do you want to do something
that'll make us both happy?

19:32.272 --> 19:34.407
Oh.

19:34.407 --> 19:37.176
<i>♪ Trust me
We a real good time ♪</i>

19:37.176 --> 19:38.778
<i>Okay, I can confirm that.</i>

19:38.778 --> 19:41.180
<i>No, thank you, Mr. Volker.</i>

19:41.180 --> 19:43.483
<i>Future Congressman Tate really
appreciates the support.</i>

19:43.483 --> 19:45.451
All right. Talk to you soon.

19:45.451 --> 19:47.287
What's up, Bru?
What you doing here?

19:47.287 --> 19:48.721
Like, existentially?

19:48.721 --> 19:50.690
I think my soul's on some real

19:50.690 --> 19:52.926
serious expansion shit
in this lifetime, you know?

19:52.926 --> 19:55.461
Oh, but, like, here, here?

19:55.461 --> 19:56.963
- Yeah, here.
- Oh.

19:57.196 --> 19:59.265
This the first day
of my internship.

19:59.265 --> 20:01.200
I'm raking in bank
for Tate, okay?

20:01.200 --> 20:02.468
Wait, what?
You're the new intern?

20:02.468 --> 20:03.903
I was supposed
to be Tate's new intern.

20:03.903 --> 20:05.672
Uh...

20:05.672 --> 20:07.340
Is he here?

20:07.340 --> 20:10.476
Um, I...
I think he's on a call.

20:10.476 --> 20:12.612
<i>Tariq.</i>

20:12.612 --> 20:15.248
My young brother,
unexpected turn of events.

20:15.248 --> 20:16.916
So you gave away my internship?

20:16.916 --> 20:20.553
Uh, excuse me,
no one "gave me" anything.

20:20.553 --> 20:23.289
Think of it as a redirection.

20:23.289 --> 20:26.526
Listen, I ain't even gonna
hold you.

20:26.526 --> 20:27.927
Your Black ass
is still hot as fuck

20:27.927 --> 20:29.228
out here in these streets,

20:29.228 --> 20:31.598
and it's not a good look
for my team.

20:31.598 --> 20:33.900
You know, I tried to work
the wrongfully accused angle

20:33.900 --> 20:35.501
to boost both of our images,

20:35.501 --> 20:38.004
but it's just not gonna bring
in the kind of contributions

20:38.237 --> 20:39.572
Team Tate needs right now.

20:39.572 --> 20:40.573
So you throwing me
under the bus

20:40.573 --> 20:41.908
for some fucking
campaign dollars?

20:41.908 --> 20:43.910
You're goddamn right.

20:43.910 --> 20:45.445
It's for a bigger cause.

20:45.445 --> 20:47.614
So what about the course credit
I was supposed to get?

20:47.614 --> 20:49.549
You're a St. Patrick.

20:49.549 --> 20:51.351
You'll figure it out.

20:51.351 --> 20:53.786
Here, take a hat.

20:58.625 --> 21:01.027
A'ight, so got some people
working some corners

21:01.260 --> 21:02.895
in Southside,
but we gonna need more.

21:02.895 --> 21:04.430
- That's you.
- I already told you,

21:04.430 --> 21:06.399
I'm not moving weight for Noma

21:06.399 --> 21:08.735
or any other fucking
connect you find.

21:08.735 --> 21:10.336
Wait, Dru ain't talk to you?

21:10.336 --> 21:13.406
Dru ain't say shit
'cause he knows what I said.

21:13.406 --> 21:15.508
Or because he's distracted
with punk-ass Everett.

21:15.508 --> 21:18.311
Yeah, you know he's still
fucking with that nigga, right?

21:18.311 --> 21:19.312
That's where he was at
the night

21:19.312 --> 21:21.381
Mecca's soldiers attacked us.

21:21.381 --> 21:22.815
Then Dru brought him
to the penthouse

21:22.815 --> 21:23.816
where we were meeting Kai.

21:23.816 --> 21:25.018
The motherfucker
laid eyes on him

21:25.018 --> 21:26.753
and everything.

21:29.856 --> 21:31.391
<i>Your call has been forwarded</i>

21:31.391 --> 21:33.459
<i>to an automatic
voice message system.</i>

21:33.459 --> 21:36.029
See? He's probably
with him right now.

21:36.029 --> 21:37.830
Pops, you keep pushing
for Dru to take the throne,

21:37.830 --> 21:38.865
but he can't be trusted.

21:38.865 --> 21:39.932
- He's not ready.
- But you are?

21:39.932 --> 21:40.833
I know I am.

21:40.833 --> 21:42.535
You're not ready for shit!

21:43.069 --> 21:45.038
And what, you think I forgot
about you and Mecca's

21:45.038 --> 21:46.639
fucking idea to take me out?

21:46.639 --> 21:48.307
Huh?

21:48.307 --> 21:50.043
That whole hit would've
never fucking happened

21:50.043 --> 21:53.646
if you weren't such
a fucking brute and disloyal.

21:53.646 --> 21:54.981
So I will deal with Dru
however the fuck

21:54.981 --> 21:56.883
I want to deal with him.

21:56.883 --> 21:58.084
If there's anybody
in this house

21:58.317 --> 22:02.388
that needs to gain my trust,
it's fucking you.

22:05.058 --> 22:06.793
And as far as I can tell

22:06.793 --> 22:09.495
there's only one way for you to do that.

22:10.029 --> 22:14.400
Your mom's not gonna rest
until we find Zeke's killer, right?

22:14.400 --> 22:16.469
Handle it.

22:16.469 --> 22:20.640
You do that,
and then maybe we can talk.

22:25.478 --> 22:27.880
Thank you for helping me.
I hate packing.

22:27.880 --> 22:29.716
Of course.

22:29.716 --> 22:31.050
Now, you know you about to be

22:31.050 --> 22:32.985
the only Black man
in OKC, right?

22:35.722 --> 22:37.824
Not if you come visit.

22:39.592 --> 22:42.361
Is that like...

22:42.361 --> 22:43.529
an invitation or what?

22:43.529 --> 22:44.964
<i>What you think?</i>

22:44.964 --> 22:47.400
And speaking of invitations,

22:47.400 --> 22:50.002
my signing party's
tomorrow night at 1 Oak,

22:50.002 --> 22:52.472
and I want you to come
as my plus-one.

22:53.873 --> 22:55.541
So I'd be, like, your date?

22:55.541 --> 23:00.079
I mean, I want you there
with me...

23:00.079 --> 23:02.648
but I can't tell the world

23:02.648 --> 23:05.785
what role you play
in my life...

23:05.785 --> 23:07.653
not right now.

23:07.653 --> 23:08.888
Right.

23:12.024 --> 23:13.926
<i>I'm moving
at the pace I can, Dru.</i>

23:14.894 --> 23:15.862
Don't be greedy.

23:15.862 --> 23:18.664
Don't be what?

23:18.664 --> 23:21.000
Do you have any idea how much
heat I'm getting from my family

23:21.000 --> 23:22.168
'cause of this--'cause of us?

23:22.401 --> 23:23.569
This isn't about your family.

23:23.569 --> 23:25.171
This is the biggest moment
of my entire life,

23:25.404 --> 23:27.874
and I need you there.

23:27.874 --> 23:29.876
Why does a label matter?

23:29.876 --> 23:32.945
Can you show up
and be supportive?

23:38.885 --> 23:40.720
Okay.

23:42.121 --> 23:44.090
Okay, I'm-I'm sorry.

23:48.561 --> 23:50.863
Send me the info.

23:50.863 --> 23:52.098
Thank you.

23:57.737 --> 24:01.140
Frank was like a brother to me.

24:01.140 --> 24:03.810
I still can't believe he's gone.

24:03.810 --> 24:05.111
He loved you so much.

24:05.111 --> 24:06.479
I know.

24:06.479 --> 24:10.183
He would've done anything for you, Lorenzo.

24:10.183 --> 24:11.751
I know.

24:12.485 --> 24:14.921
And now that I'm out

24:14.921 --> 24:18.558
if there's anything I can do for you
or the family

24:18.558 --> 24:20.660
you let me know.

24:20.660 --> 24:22.695
I'm here for you.

24:22.695 --> 24:23.663
Thank you.

24:23.663 --> 24:24.730
Of course.

24:24.730 --> 24:25.832
I really appreciate it.

24:27.200 --> 24:31.170
Mo, someone's here to see you.

24:32.772 --> 24:34.240
What are you doing here,
Evelyn?

24:40.513 --> 24:43.583
People always stop bringing
food after the funeral...

24:43.583 --> 24:46.986
but I couldn't cook for months.

24:48.754 --> 24:51.924
Losing Frank was one thing, but...

24:51.924 --> 24:53.926
I can't imagine
if it was one of my boys.

24:53.926 --> 24:56.863
I'm so sorry
for your loss, Monet.

24:56.863 --> 24:58.731
Thanks for stopping by.

24:59.966 --> 25:02.501
You should know
that some white cop's

25:02.501 --> 25:05.938
been sniffing around,
asking questions about Frank,

25:05.938 --> 25:08.140
said his name's Whitman.

25:10.509 --> 25:12.144
I didn't give him anything,
of course,

25:12.144 --> 25:15.748
but you deserve to know.

25:15.748 --> 25:17.950
Look, you been a good friend.

25:17.950 --> 25:20.920
That's not necessary.

25:20.920 --> 25:23.956
In fact...

25:26.025 --> 25:28.828
...my boys got a little
foothold in Brooklyn.

25:28.828 --> 25:32.531
They been taking care of me
real good.

25:32.531 --> 25:33.900
You helped me out
in my time of need,

25:33.900 --> 25:35.835
so now I'm returning the favor.

25:45.678 --> 25:47.713
But we both know
it won't bring 'em back.

25:49.315 --> 25:51.250
Yeah.

25:53.019 --> 25:55.821
Take care of yourself, Monet.

25:59.225 --> 26:01.694
<i>He can't just give your
internship away like that.</i>

26:01.694 --> 26:04.830
Honestly, he really can.
It's his campaign.

26:04.830 --> 26:06.165
Did he say why?

26:06.165 --> 26:08.034
I told you, B,
nobody's fucking with me.

26:08.034 --> 26:09.268
And you know, you lucky as fuck

26:09.268 --> 26:10.736
you don't got to deal
with this shit.

26:10.736 --> 26:12.605
Well, what are you gonna do
about the credits?

26:12.605 --> 26:13.806
I mean, you need to take, like,

26:13.806 --> 26:15.841
two extra classes
to make up for those.

26:15.841 --> 26:17.043
Fuck if I know.

26:17.043 --> 26:18.344
Well, an internship
just opened up at Weston.

26:18.577 --> 26:20.947
- You should take it.
- Why, so we can move product?

26:20.947 --> 26:24.050
Bro, ask me again if we moving
product in your family's house.

26:24.050 --> 26:26.052
All right, you might be able to
get unlimited fucking chances,

26:26.052 --> 26:29.188
but it's not all fun and games
for the rest of us, B.

26:29.188 --> 26:31.357
I'm trying to save our lives
from Noma.

26:31.590 --> 26:33.326
All right, and if I do that,
what the fuck is it worth

26:33.326 --> 26:35.361
if I can't see my sister
or my mom after?

26:36.662 --> 26:37.763
There's things
that are more important

26:37.763 --> 26:40.032
than just money and drugs, B.

26:40.032 --> 26:41.934
And that's family.
Family's fucking important.

26:43.736 --> 26:45.237
Hey, we're your family too.

26:45.237 --> 26:46.639
That's right.

26:46.639 --> 26:48.174
And you should take
that internship.

26:48.174 --> 26:50.676
We're not gonna
move weight there,

26:50.676 --> 26:52.111
and if you're worried
about your reputation,

26:52.111 --> 26:53.779
this is a smart move.

26:53.779 --> 26:54.947
<i>She's right, 'Riq.</i>

26:54.947 --> 26:56.749
My uncle would be
a great fucking reference.

26:56.749 --> 26:58.818
Okay, maybe,

26:58.818 --> 27:00.186
but I'm sure Papa Weston don't
want me there.

27:00.186 --> 27:01.921
Nah, dude, fuck him.
I'll handle him.

27:01.921 --> 27:02.989
You don't gotta worry
about that.

27:08.260 --> 27:10.930
Fine.
Fine, but no fucking drugs.

27:10.930 --> 27:13.733
No drugs, I promise.

27:13.733 --> 27:14.734
A'ight, bet.

27:14.734 --> 27:17.136
Fuck yeah.

27:17.136 --> 27:18.938
Whoo! I'll set it up.

27:18.938 --> 27:20.172
You're fucking crazy.

27:20.172 --> 27:21.240
I'll be right back.

27:21.240 --> 27:23.209
Gotta go take care
of something.

27:23.209 --> 27:25.945
<i>Don't touch my shit.</i>

27:25.945 --> 27:27.146
We have to tell him
about Lauren, like, now--

27:27.146 --> 27:28.347
Shh. Shut the fuck up, Brayden.

27:28.347 --> 27:29.715
- Are you fucking crazy?
- Okay, what, are we just

27:29.715 --> 27:30.983
gonna lie to him
for the rest of our lives?

27:30.983 --> 27:32.284
You said it yourself,
we're his family.

27:32.284 --> 27:33.953
- We're all he has.
- Exactly.

27:33.953 --> 27:35.221
And we did what we had
to do to protect him.

27:35.221 --> 27:37.223
How does him finding out
help anything?

27:37.223 --> 27:39.258
It would undermine his trust,
not earn it.

27:41.160 --> 27:42.661
There are only two people
on this planet

27:42.661 --> 27:43.929
who really know what we did,
and we're taking that

27:43.929 --> 27:46.032
to the motherfucking grave.

27:48.768 --> 27:50.002
Fuck.

27:54.774 --> 27:56.008
<i>You're Mecca's pilot, man.</i>

27:56.008 --> 27:57.209
Listen, I know
you saw something that night.

27:57.209 --> 27:59.345
So fucking talk.

27:59.345 --> 28:02.882
I just heard the shots
and found the body.

28:02.882 --> 28:04.884
I don't know who did it!

28:04.884 --> 28:06.819
That's okay, my guy.
You got seven more chances

28:06.819 --> 28:08.354
to remember something, huh?

28:13.092 --> 28:14.393
Huh?

28:14.393 --> 28:16.762
You can fly a fucking plane
with one hand, right?

28:16.762 --> 28:19.698
I only saw him from the back.

28:19.698 --> 28:22.902
Bald-headed dude
in a dark jacket.

28:22.902 --> 28:25.204
Big-ass collar and zippers.

28:25.204 --> 28:27.940
There it is.

28:27.940 --> 28:30.109
See, I knew you was
fucking paying attention.

28:31.811 --> 28:32.878
What's up, Big Money?
Talk to me.

28:32.878 --> 28:34.346
I didn't see him, I swear.

28:34.346 --> 28:36.115
<i>I swear.</i>

28:37.850 --> 28:39.251
Please don't.

28:39.251 --> 28:40.953
Please!

28:55.034 --> 28:57.470
All I saw was the car,
it was driving away!

28:57.470 --> 28:58.971
The taillight was busted!

29:02.074 --> 29:03.809
Thank you.

29:05.177 --> 29:06.445
You've been very helpful.

29:06.445 --> 29:09.048
Dude, this is gonna be so lit.

29:09.048 --> 29:11.383
So KeKe's your supervisor,
but I'm on her team,

29:11.383 --> 29:12.952
so I'm kind of like
your half-boss

29:12.952 --> 29:14.253
if you think about it,
but don't worry,

29:14.253 --> 29:16.188
I'm super chill,
and I get my own coffee,

29:16.188 --> 29:17.923
and I only need my balls
massaged, like, once a week.

29:17.923 --> 29:19.358
I fucking quit.
Get the fuck out of here.

29:19.358 --> 29:21.093
I'm fucking with you,
I'm fucking with you.

29:21.093 --> 29:22.361
Uh--oh, there's Reva and Lex...

29:22.361 --> 29:23.429
- Hey, what up?
- ...they/them.

29:23.429 --> 29:24.897
Uh, this is my boy Tariq.

29:24.897 --> 29:27.366
Kitchen, bathroom, uh...

29:27.366 --> 29:29.235
oh, there's personal trainer
Nick right there.

29:29.235 --> 29:30.402
Gym's on the third floor.

29:30.402 --> 29:32.071
What's up, boys?

29:32.071 --> 29:34.206
Your first session's free, yeah?

29:34.206 --> 29:35.908
<i>You want my advice,</i>

29:35.908 --> 29:37.443
schedule something.

29:37.443 --> 29:39.044
Looks like you should
if you want to be at your best.

29:40.846 --> 29:43.315
I'm fucking with you, bro.

29:43.315 --> 29:46.018
Nicky boy,
you know, I'm still, uh,

29:46.018 --> 29:47.286
recovering from that
Muay Thai thing,

29:47.286 --> 29:48.854
but yeah,
I'll be back at it soon.

29:48.854 --> 29:51.157
Mm-hmm. Do more, be more,
my man, all right?

29:51.157 --> 29:52.825
You can have results
or excuses,

29:52.825 --> 29:54.426
not both.

29:55.161 --> 29:56.295
What a dick.

29:56.295 --> 29:58.030
Brayden Jefferson Weston!

29:59.231 --> 30:01.901
Family meeting now!

30:03.135 --> 30:05.137
You're so fucked.

30:09.041 --> 30:10.976
What the fuck is
Tariq St. Patrick doing here?

30:10.976 --> 30:12.178
Yeah, dude. I mean,

30:12.178 --> 30:14.079
there's no way
you're that fucking stupid.

30:14.079 --> 30:16.582
I mean, did you really forget
about everything that happened

30:16.815 --> 30:18.951
over the last year,
or do you hate Dad that much?

30:18.951 --> 30:21.020
I assume this went through you.

30:21.020 --> 30:22.454
He's our newest intern.

30:22.454 --> 30:25.891
I hope you gave him a...
warm Weston welcome.

30:25.891 --> 30:28.894
You can't possibly think
that's a good idea.

30:28.894 --> 30:30.963
I made it clear Brayden
was to stay away from him

30:30.963 --> 30:32.198
after that whole
CourseCorrect ordeal.

30:32.198 --> 30:33.265
I'm not a kid, Dad.

30:33.265 --> 30:34.466
You can't just choose
my friends.

30:34.466 --> 30:36.502
Well, clearly someone
fucking needs to.

30:36.502 --> 30:38.837
Having Tariq at the firm
is not good for the family.

30:38.837 --> 30:41.073
Not good for the bottom line,
'cause that's all you guys

30:41.073 --> 30:42.141
- really care about, right?
- <i>Fuck off, dude.</i>

30:42.141 --> 30:44.410
That's enough, Brayden!

30:44.410 --> 30:46.378
- He has to go.
- He didn't do anything wrong!

30:46.378 --> 30:48.347
I was the one dealing drugs.

30:48.347 --> 30:50.983
Holding it against him
is just fucking racism.

30:50.983 --> 30:53.052
You guys just fired someone
for this shit yesterday.

30:53.052 --> 30:55.120
What the fuck happened
to zero tolerance, huh?

30:55.120 --> 30:56.222
He's not wrong, Bobby.

30:56.222 --> 30:57.489
It's not the same.

30:57.489 --> 31:00.526
We can't punish
an innocent young Black man

31:00.526 --> 31:03.862
for something
your drug-dealing son did.

31:03.862 --> 31:06.165
Besides, you know what's great
for business these days?

31:06.165 --> 31:08.000
Inclusivity and diversity.

31:08.000 --> 31:09.201
<i>"Inclusivity and diversity."</i>

31:09.201 --> 31:11.270
<i>What, are you serious?</i>

31:11.270 --> 31:13.339
Oh, come on, Dad.

31:13.339 --> 31:17.209
What, the firm's gonna take
Juneteenth as a holiday now?

31:19.311 --> 31:22.314
I guess we would have
the vineyard to ourselves.

31:25.451 --> 31:28.020
Tariq, come on in here.

32:31.250 --> 32:32.618
Hey, Salim.

32:32.618 --> 32:35.621
Um, I heard that sometimes
TAs have a set of books

32:35.621 --> 32:38.957
that students can borrow,
and I was wondering if maybe--

32:38.957 --> 32:41.026
Say no more. Help yourself.

32:41.026 --> 32:43.262
Thanks.

32:50.736 --> 32:53.539
One question, though.

32:53.539 --> 32:56.208
How is it that you can afford
a Balenciaga backpack

32:56.208 --> 32:58.310
but not the books
to put inside it?

32:58.310 --> 33:00.746
Well, my parents are covering

33:00.979 --> 33:02.214
tuition and not much else,

33:02.214 --> 33:04.516
so I guess
I'm kind of on my own.

33:04.516 --> 33:06.018
Okay.

33:06.018 --> 33:09.188
So the problem's bigger
than American Psyche.

33:09.188 --> 33:10.489
Well...

33:10.489 --> 33:11.657
I might have the hookup

33:11.657 --> 33:14.159
for a unique
on-campus opportunity

33:14.159 --> 33:16.628
if a young queen's
not opposed to work.

33:16.628 --> 33:18.030
Not at all.

33:18.030 --> 33:20.332
Th-that would be amazing, actually.

33:20.332 --> 33:22.167
Consider it done.

33:22.167 --> 33:24.436
Thanks.

33:34.713 --> 33:37.583
What the fuck is this?

33:44.022 --> 33:46.258
Fuck.

33:49.228 --> 33:51.163
Fuck this nigga.

33:54.466 --> 33:57.302
Monet Tejada, what a surprise.

33:57.302 --> 33:59.238
What the fuck is this about?

33:59.238 --> 34:01.807
Clearly, you have
a broken side mirror.

34:02.040 --> 34:03.108
Wouldn't want you to be
a hazard out there--

34:03.108 --> 34:05.144
Bullshit. What do you want?

34:05.144 --> 34:06.345
And why are you talking
to Evelyn Castillo?

34:06.345 --> 34:07.346
You know what?
You can just shut the fuck up.

34:07.346 --> 34:08.614
I'll ask the questions here.

34:08.614 --> 34:10.349
Where were you the night
of Carrie Milgram's murder?

34:10.349 --> 34:11.550
That's none of your business.

34:11.550 --> 34:12.751
Well, that's
where you're wrong.

34:12.751 --> 34:16.455
See, it was none
of my business...

34:16.455 --> 34:19.525
right up until Zeke Cross came
to me about your possible

34:19.525 --> 34:22.361
involvement in what
was very likely not a suicide.

34:22.361 --> 34:24.730
So I took a look around.

34:24.730 --> 34:26.665
There's a funny thing.

34:26.665 --> 34:29.501
There's a traffic cam photo
of you

34:29.501 --> 34:31.470
in the vicinity
of Carrie Milgram's apartment

34:31.470 --> 34:34.206
within the coroner's
time of death window.

34:34.206 --> 34:35.474
Zeke came to you?

34:35.474 --> 34:37.609
Yeah, he did.

34:37.609 --> 34:40.212
Thoughts and prayers,
by the way.

34:40.212 --> 34:42.448
So now I'm coming for you,

34:42.448 --> 34:44.583
and I'm gonna keep coming
for you

34:44.583 --> 34:47.586
and your family
and your fucking friends

34:47.586 --> 34:48.654
until I get to the truth.

34:48.654 --> 34:50.088
Look, I didn't have shit to do

34:50.088 --> 34:52.558
with Carrie Milgram's death,
and you know it.

34:52.558 --> 34:54.526
Otherwise your ass would be out
here with handcuffs and shit.

34:54.526 --> 34:56.161
Knowing and proving
are two different things,

34:56.161 --> 34:58.163
but trust I'll get there.

34:58.163 --> 35:00.265
Oh, you know what?

35:00.265 --> 35:02.501
There was something else
I figured out.

35:05.471 --> 35:08.273
Your special relationship
with Detective Ramirez.

35:08.273 --> 35:09.541
Too bad your boyfriend's
not around

35:09.541 --> 35:10.676
- to get you out of this one.
- Look, I don't know

35:10.676 --> 35:12.411
what the fuck
you talking about,

35:12.411 --> 35:14.146
so unless you gonna arrest me,
get the fuck out of here

35:14.146 --> 35:15.814
harassing me
with this bullshit.

35:21.854 --> 35:23.489
You can go,

35:23.489 --> 35:25.424
but I'll see you soon.

35:25.424 --> 35:28.126
Fuck.

35:28.126 --> 35:29.828
Uh--yeah, I'm on it.

35:29.828 --> 35:31.563
I'm on it.

35:31.563 --> 35:32.764
Saxe!

35:35.133 --> 35:36.835
Saxe!

35:36.835 --> 35:39.304
<i>Jesus Christ.</i>

35:40.572 --> 35:42.641
- You rang?
- I just got a disturbing call

35:42.641 --> 35:45.844
from Monet Tejada
about some police harassment.

35:45.844 --> 35:47.479
Is your girlfriend working

35:47.479 --> 35:49.448
with that fucking
ass clown, Whitman?

35:49.448 --> 35:53.185
Okay, you--first of all,
Jenny's not my girlfriend.

35:53.185 --> 35:54.353
Just ask her.

35:54.353 --> 35:56.622
Second of all, I'll find out.

35:56.622 --> 35:58.323
Yes, do that.

35:59.558 --> 36:02.227
Have we, uh,
moved forward on Rollins?

36:02.227 --> 36:04.429
Ah, not yet.

36:04.429 --> 36:05.764
Not yet?

36:05.764 --> 36:07.599
See, not yet needs
to be right now,

36:07.599 --> 36:09.935
so get on it.

36:22.915 --> 36:24.383
<i>Jenny Sullivan.</i>

36:24.383 --> 36:26.285
Hey.

36:26.285 --> 36:29.254
You ever find out who was
watching the Spears penthouse?

36:32.257 --> 36:34.459
No. Why?

36:34.459 --> 36:36.628
You might want
to look into Kevin Whitman.

37:15.667 --> 37:18.303
Hey, Tariq, can you set up
the conference room

37:18.303 --> 37:19.304
for the 3:00?

37:19.304 --> 37:21.473
- Yeah, sure.
- Thanks.

37:21.473 --> 37:23.508
<i>Ooh, that was a big one.</i>

37:23.508 --> 37:25.243
- <i>To your health.</i>
- <i>Oh, yeah.</i>

37:25.243 --> 37:27.446
Oh, you bet. L'chaim.

37:27.446 --> 37:28.814
- Ooh.
- Ah, fuck yeah.

37:28.814 --> 37:29.881
- Tasty.
- Fuck yes.

37:29.881 --> 37:31.316
Ooh, fuck yeah.

37:31.316 --> 37:33.652
- Yeah.
- Fuck yeah.

37:33.652 --> 37:35.520
What's up, new guy?
Oh, uh, can you hook me up

37:35.520 --> 37:37.389
with one of those bottles
right there?

37:37.389 --> 37:38.957
Dude, give me some of that.

37:38.957 --> 37:41.627
- Yes, sir.
- Last night was so fucked.

37:41.627 --> 37:43.929
<i>Doing it again
tonight though, right?</i>

37:43.929 --> 37:45.731
- You know it.

38:35.013 --> 38:36.648
American Ninja Warrior's
the fucking plug?

38:36.648 --> 38:38.450
Yup. He moves weight

38:38.450 --> 38:40.752
all around the fund
by leaving "protein powder"

38:40.752 --> 38:42.487
in his clients' gym lockers--

38:42.487 --> 38:44.389
and sometimes even
on their fucking desks.

38:44.389 --> 38:45.524
And the higher-ups know?

38:45.524 --> 38:47.092
They know that everybody uses,

38:47.325 --> 38:48.427
but not where it comes from,

38:48.427 --> 38:49.728
but to be honest,
they could give a shit.

38:49.728 --> 38:51.863
- Fuck.
- Caffeine, powder, pills.

38:51.863 --> 38:53.532
All they care about is paper.

38:53.532 --> 38:55.600
- <i>Of course.</i>
- The burnout rate is so insane

38:55.600 --> 38:56.902
that they just try
and squeeze everything

38:56.902 --> 38:58.403
out of people
while they have 'em.

38:58.403 --> 38:59.905
But listen, 'Riq,

38:59.905 --> 39:02.607
I heard what you said about
not shitting where we eat.

39:02.607 --> 39:05.410
I mean, there's other avenues.

39:05.410 --> 39:07.679
I already moved two bricks
at the country clubs.

39:07.679 --> 39:09.981
Bro, two fucking bricks?

39:09.981 --> 39:11.983
- I know, I kn--
- H-how many people work

39:11.983 --> 39:13.752
on our floor alone
at Weston Holdings?

39:13.752 --> 39:15.487
Shit, I don't know,
at least 30.

39:16.988 --> 39:19.491
So you times that
by 50 floors in our building,

39:19.491 --> 39:21.960
then the rest of the buildings
on fucking Wall Street.

39:21.960 --> 39:24.563
Bro, that's more than
everything we have combined.

39:24.563 --> 39:26.064
That's what I'm saying.

39:26.064 --> 39:28.633
We want to move Noma's product,
that's exactly how we do it.

39:28.633 --> 39:30.535
And if we want to take out
Nick's pipeline in the process,

39:30.535 --> 39:32.671
we can keep our names covered
while we at it.

39:32.671 --> 39:34.072
Shit, you don't gotta
tell me twice.

39:34.072 --> 39:35.607
I'm down.

39:35.607 --> 39:38.477
But you know, Nick's not
just gonna hand it over.

39:38.477 --> 39:39.878
I know.
See, that's why I didn't

39:39.878 --> 39:41.580
<i>want to fuck around here, B.</i>

39:41.580 --> 39:43.749
Shit can't get messy.

39:43.749 --> 39:45.517
You know what?

39:45.517 --> 39:48.153
I think I got an idea...

39:48.386 --> 39:51.490
but we're gonna need
Cane's help.

39:56.995 --> 39:58.430
<i>Hey, my man, my-my man, yo.</i>

39:58.430 --> 40:00.398
You got the time?

40:00.398 --> 40:03.468
Uh, yeah, it's, like--

40:04.770 --> 40:06.571
Time to pay up for what
you did, motherfucker.

40:06.571 --> 40:07.672
The fuck are you talking about?

40:16.848 --> 40:20.719
I got back from DR and my whole
fucking crew was wiped out.

40:20.719 --> 40:22.154
This for them.

40:37.068 --> 40:38.904
And this for Lil' Guap.

40:40.906 --> 40:42.440
Fuck you, bitch.

40:45.443 --> 40:47.612
I ever see you again,
you're done.

40:49.981 --> 40:52.784
Sorry, sorry. Sorry, baby.

40:52.784 --> 40:55.520
I thought y'all deaded
all them Guaps, shit.

40:55.520 --> 40:57.055
I guess not.

40:58.857 --> 41:00.625
What I can't seem
to figure out is how the hell

41:00.625 --> 41:02.127
did he know it was me
that killed Lil' Guap?

41:02.127 --> 41:04.062
<i>And why he ain't kill me
when he had the chance?</i>

41:04.062 --> 41:06.932
Wh-what the fuck were you doing
in that part of the city, Dru?

41:06.932 --> 41:07.933
Probably going to see Everett.

41:07.933 --> 41:09.234
Shut up, Cane.

41:10.969 --> 41:12.604
Dru, go lie down
on your stomach

41:12.604 --> 41:14.739
while I get something
for the paint.

41:27.519 --> 41:28.954
I told you he wasn't ready.

41:30.889 --> 41:33.725
Our family's being targeted
for killing the Guaps,

41:33.725 --> 41:37.863
and I bet you whoever did
that shit to Dru got Zeke too.

41:37.863 --> 41:40.265
Mm. I ain't so sure.

41:42.067 --> 41:44.269
I am.

41:44.502 --> 41:47.572
You got any way of tracking
this motherfucker down?

41:51.910 --> 41:53.578
Yeah, maybe.

41:53.578 --> 41:55.280
Go do that.

41:55.513 --> 41:57.849
Go make this shit right
for your mother and for Dru.

42:03.188 --> 42:05.757
All right, so this is the spot.

42:05.757 --> 42:08.093
Yo, I can't believe
they have designated jobs

42:08.093 --> 42:09.728
for Black students on campus.

42:09.728 --> 42:11.563
Yeah, it's not
an official thing.

42:11.563 --> 42:15.133
They just get handed down
each year from upperclassmen.

42:15.133 --> 42:18.169
You know, I didn't have
the best home situation either.

42:18.169 --> 42:21.039
It takes a lot for people
like us to make it here.

42:21.039 --> 42:22.874
We have to look out
for one another.

42:22.874 --> 42:24.042
I feel that.

42:24.042 --> 42:26.211
- Hi.
- Water and soda in the cooler.

42:26.211 --> 42:28.747
No booze, so no IDs.

42:28.747 --> 42:30.215
Scale on the counter
for bulk candy.

42:30.215 --> 42:34.019
Students can use their Stallion
points or you can pay cash.

42:37.022 --> 42:38.790
What's your favorite?

42:38.790 --> 42:39.858
Wait, let me guess.

42:39.858 --> 42:41.793
100 Grand.

42:41.793 --> 42:43.295
Why you say that,
'cause I'm poor?

42:43.295 --> 42:44.863
No.

42:44.863 --> 42:47.565
Okay? It's this.

42:47.565 --> 42:50.001
Ohh, a Skittles girl.

42:50.001 --> 42:51.069
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay.

42:51.069 --> 42:52.337
Taste the rainbow.

42:52.570 --> 42:54.839
Oh, you know, I read
they're all the same flavor.

42:54.839 --> 42:56.608
They just make them smell
different to trick your senses.

42:56.608 --> 42:57.742
- No.
- It's cheaper that way.

42:57.742 --> 42:59.244
Mm-hmm.
No, I don't believe you.

42:59.244 --> 43:02.080
- That's cap.
- That's capitalism.

43:03.848 --> 43:05.583
Shifts are four hours each.

43:05.583 --> 43:07.185
Look, you won't pay off
any student loans with it,

43:07.185 --> 43:08.687
but it'll buy you books,

43:08.687 --> 43:10.822
and you'll have plenty
of downtime to study,

43:10.822 --> 43:13.158
plus, free candy.

43:13.158 --> 43:15.293
Okay. Sounds perfect.

43:15.293 --> 43:17.696
Yeah. Well,
let me get your paperwork,

43:17.696 --> 43:19.965
and then I can teach you
the register.

43:36.881 --> 43:38.283
Whatever.

43:40.318 --> 43:42.387
Hold on.

43:42.620 --> 43:44.089
You cool with being
my girlfriend in public now?

43:44.089 --> 43:45.223
'Cause ain't nobody

43:45.223 --> 43:46.624
paying attention here.

43:46.624 --> 43:48.126
Yeah, whatever.
You made the drops?

43:48.126 --> 43:50.061
Yep.
Everything's circulating

43:50.061 --> 43:51.796
at Harvard, Penn, Dartmouth,

43:51.796 --> 43:53.298
and Yoli is taking it back
to Yale.

43:53.298 --> 43:55.266
Fire.
Once those are up and running,

43:55.266 --> 43:57.736
it won't matter that we can't
sell at Stansfield.

43:57.736 --> 43:59.304
We make a good team.

43:59.304 --> 44:01.840
<i>♪ Drifting away
In the tall dark seas ♪</i>

44:01.840 --> 44:04.342
<i>♪ Waves come and go... ♪</i>

44:04.342 --> 44:06.778
I'm gonna go put this on.

44:06.778 --> 44:07.879
Uh, okay.

44:13.952 --> 44:15.320
<i>How much?</i>

44:15.320 --> 44:17.889
Uh, for the candy
and the water, it is gonna be--

44:17.889 --> 44:19.824
Uh, I got my own. Thank you.

44:19.824 --> 44:21.092
Oh, 'scuse the fuck out of me.

44:21.092 --> 44:22.761
Okay, that's $1.34.

44:33.838 --> 44:35.940
- Your change.
- Thank you.

44:35.940 --> 44:37.275
You're welcome.
And $1 for the water.

44:37.275 --> 44:38.309
All right, got you.

44:38.309 --> 44:40.078
<i>Here you go.</i>

44:42.147 --> 44:43.281
Come on.

44:43.281 --> 44:44.349
Look, I know
the schools ain't really

44:44.349 --> 44:45.683
bringing in that much
money yet.

44:45.683 --> 44:47.252
You good? 'Cause we about to be

44:47.252 --> 44:48.987
flush as fuck on Wall Street,

44:48.987 --> 44:51.389
so if you need anything,
I got you.

44:51.389 --> 44:54.225
I got it covered, thank you.

44:54.225 --> 44:56.861
So Brayden sold you on moving
weight at his family's fund?

44:56.861 --> 44:58.263
I mean, shit,
he ain't even have to.

44:58.263 --> 45:00.198
Shit sells itself.

45:00.198 --> 45:01.833
'Bout to blow the fuck up.

45:07.205 --> 45:08.807
Councilman.

45:08.807 --> 45:09.908
Young Weston.

45:09.908 --> 45:11.776
Thank you for meeting me here.

45:14.112 --> 45:17.482
No, thank you
for this very, uh,

45:17.715 --> 45:19.851
generous contribution
to my campaign.

45:19.851 --> 45:21.953
I think BruShaundria's
gonna work out just fine.

45:21.953 --> 45:23.788
I told you, she's money.

45:23.788 --> 45:27.725
But listen, you can never
tell Tariq about this.

45:27.725 --> 45:30.395
In exchange for the Weston name
to my list of donors?

45:30.395 --> 45:32.931
No need to worry.
I'll take it to the grave.

45:32.931 --> 45:35.333
I just hope my young brother
Tariq lands on his feet.

45:35.333 --> 45:36.868
Oh, no, you don't got
to worry about that.

45:36.868 --> 45:38.236
He already has, trust me.

45:51.883 --> 45:54.452
Hey. Bad news.

45:54.452 --> 45:56.020
My bosses don't think
we have enough

45:56.020 --> 45:58.223
to greenlight
a RICO investigation.

45:58.223 --> 46:00.091
They're having
a hard time believing

46:00.091 --> 46:02.060
that a college kid
is behind a drug org.

46:02.060 --> 46:04.262
What'll it take?

46:04.262 --> 46:06.998
They need the dots connected.

46:06.998 --> 46:09.467
How does Tariq know Ramirez?

46:09.467 --> 46:11.402
What's his connection
to Dante Spears?

46:11.402 --> 46:13.304
Is that where the drugs
were coming from?

46:13.304 --> 46:15.340
And if so,
who's their new connect?

46:17.942 --> 46:19.110
You wanted to see me?

46:19.110 --> 46:21.179
I thought I told you
to stand down,

46:21.179 --> 46:23.948
so why am I hearing
about you grilling Monet Tejada

46:23.948 --> 46:25.483
over a bogus traffic stop?

46:25.483 --> 46:29.087
Uh, with all due respect,
you're not my supervisor.

46:29.087 --> 46:31.289
Would you like me to have
a chat with your supervisor?

46:31.289 --> 46:33.291
Because you'd be looking
at suspension.

46:33.291 --> 46:35.493
You know, maybe you'd prefer
to know what I know,

46:35.493 --> 46:37.428
'cause you're only looking
at half the picture.

46:41.466 --> 46:43.201
I'm listening.

46:43.201 --> 46:44.536
She on the team?

46:44.536 --> 46:46.237
Blanca Rodriguez, DEA.

46:47.572 --> 46:49.374
All right, when I had
Zeke Cross in the box,

46:49.374 --> 46:52.343
he had a PBA card
from Detective Danilo Ramirez.

46:52.343 --> 46:54.012
After he lied to me
about how he got it,

46:54.012 --> 46:56.281
I did some digging,
and it turns out

46:56.281 --> 46:58.183
that Ramirez took
a disproportionate number

46:58.183 --> 47:00.118
of calls to the Tejada house.

47:00.118 --> 47:01.853
On top of that,
there's at least one instance

47:01.853 --> 47:03.121
when Cane was pulled in

47:03.121 --> 47:05.223
and Ramirez cleared
the charges.

47:05.223 --> 47:07.458
We know that Ramirez brought
the Weston boys home

47:07.458 --> 47:10.295
after Cane forced them
to sell drugs on the street.

47:10.295 --> 47:13.198
You're saying that Ramirez
was working with the Tejadas?

47:13.198 --> 47:15.099
No, <i>for</i> the Tejadas.

47:15.099 --> 47:17.335
But more than that,

47:17.335 --> 47:19.871
I think he was fucking
Monet Tejada.

47:21.573 --> 47:22.907
Look, you guys are...

47:22.907 --> 47:25.410
you're focused
on the St. Patrick kid.

47:28.346 --> 47:31.216
He is not the kingpin.

47:31.216 --> 47:33.117
<i>Not by himself, anyway.</i>

47:36.120 --> 47:37.322
Holy shit.

47:37.322 --> 47:40.992
Monet Tejada has known ties
to Dante Spears.

47:40.992 --> 47:42.594
If that's where they were
getting their product...

47:42.594 --> 47:44.495
There's our RICO.

47:44.495 --> 47:46.030
It's something, all right,

47:46.030 --> 47:48.399
but it'll take some doing
to prove it.

47:48.399 --> 47:51.603
Yeah, but it'll definitely give
our task force a green light.

47:56.374 --> 47:58.409
Maybe your being
so fucking stubborn

47:58.409 --> 48:00.612
has its advantages.

48:14.092 --> 48:16.094
Damn, she was fine!

48:18.963 --> 48:20.298
Stop moving.

48:20.298 --> 48:22.000
You coming with me, motherfucker.

48:22.000 --> 48:23.268
Fuck I am.

48:55.633 --> 48:56.601
What do you want?

48:56.601 --> 48:58.102
I-I been calling
and texting you.

48:58.102 --> 49:00.538
- Why didn't--
- It's over, Dru.

49:00.538 --> 49:02.607
Wait, I-I... look, I'm sorry
I didn't make it last night.

49:02.607 --> 49:04.075
- I don't care.
- I-I can explain.

49:04.075 --> 49:06.377
Clearly, you had something
more important to do.

49:06.377 --> 49:07.545
Ev, you don't see
my fucking face?

49:07.545 --> 49:08.646
I got jumped.

49:08.646 --> 49:10.581
By the same guys from the club?

49:10.581 --> 49:12.116
Or someone else this time?

49:13.551 --> 49:15.286
Never mind.
I don't want to know.

49:15.286 --> 49:17.989
I've had enough, Dru.
I'm moving to OKC.

49:17.989 --> 49:19.957
I don't want any of this drama
following me.

49:21.526 --> 49:24.195
This isn't drama.
This is my life.

49:26.230 --> 49:27.632
Hey. Ev, this is...

49:27.632 --> 49:29.734
this is our life.

49:29.967 --> 49:31.602
Look, I'm sorry
I didn't make it last night.

49:31.602 --> 49:35.206
But I promise you, it's
the only place I wanted to be.

49:35.206 --> 49:37.675
No, please.
It's always where I want to be.

49:39.243 --> 49:40.411
You don't understand
how bad my family

49:40.411 --> 49:41.412
doesn't want this to work--

49:41.412 --> 49:43.514
Maybe your family is right.

49:43.514 --> 49:44.682
Ev, no--

49:44.682 --> 49:47.051
Don't follow me!

50:08.573 --> 50:10.108
Nice work in there, man.

50:10.108 --> 50:12.143
You know, if you want
to up your game, let me know.

50:12.143 --> 50:13.277
I can hook you up
with some supplements

50:13.277 --> 50:15.113
that are next fucking level,
all right?

50:15.113 --> 50:16.381
A'ight, bet. I'll hit you up.

50:16.381 --> 50:18.015
Got you. Anytime.

51:13.771 --> 51:15.239
Fuck!

51:15.239 --> 51:17.208
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

51:19.110 --> 51:20.812
Ah, fuck!

51:24.816 --> 51:27.485
I'm calling 911.

51:27.485 --> 51:29.654
This the motherfucker
who jumped Dru and killed Zeke.

51:29.654 --> 51:31.122
The fuck I am. Fuck I am.

51:31.122 --> 51:32.390
Look, I was out of the country

51:32.390 --> 51:33.758
for that Zeke shit
when it went down,

51:33.758 --> 51:35.293
<i>and I was hired to jump Dru.</i>

51:35.293 --> 51:36.661
Hired by who?

51:36.661 --> 51:39.797
Don't believe a word
this motherfucker says.

51:39.797 --> 51:42.333
Of course he's gonna lie
to try to save his fucking ass.

51:42.333 --> 51:45.403
Yo, Cane, is this really
the motherfucker that did it?

51:51.409 --> 51:52.877
Found this
on this greedy motherfucker.

51:53.110 --> 51:54.278
<i>I ain't do anything, man.</i>

51:54.278 --> 51:56.180
Dru's chain,
Zeke's championship ring.

51:56.180 --> 51:57.148
<i>I ain't do anything.</i>

51:57.148 --> 51:58.282
Yeah, he must have pulled
that shit off of Zeke

51:58.282 --> 51:59.650
when he fucking killed him.

51:59.650 --> 52:01.385
- <i>Wait. I-I had nothing--</i>
- You motherfucker.

52:09.160 --> 52:11.329
What the fuck y'all looking at?

52:11.329 --> 52:13.564
Clean this shit up.

52:27.478 --> 52:29.146
Okay.

52:32.149 --> 52:34.252
Ah, come on, come on, come on.

52:38.689 --> 52:39.857
What the fuck?

53:03.881 --> 53:05.950
This is not a good time, Davis.

53:06.183 --> 53:08.886
<i>If you calling about Zeke,
I got everything I need.</i>

54:32.003 --> 54:34.305
That's good work tonight.

54:34.305 --> 54:35.640
I think we'll all rest easier

54:35.640 --> 54:38.442
now that this motherfucker got
what he deserved.

54:40.611 --> 54:42.980
Yep.

54:42.980 --> 54:46.017
I see you got
that taillight fixed.

54:46.017 --> 54:47.818
Yeah, man, a while ago.

54:49.387 --> 54:50.721
What's up, Cane? You good?

54:50.721 --> 54:53.691
Hell yeah. Never been better.

54:53.691 --> 54:56.627
'Cause I know you killed Zeke.

54:56.627 --> 54:58.362
What the fuck
are you talking about?

54:58.362 --> 55:01.065
We just loaded up Zeke's killer
into your car.

55:01.298 --> 55:03.434
Monet may have bought
that shit, old man, but not me.

55:03.434 --> 55:05.436
Come on, man, you sent me
to do a fucking job.

55:05.436 --> 55:06.771
- I did it.
- So what are you saying?

55:06.771 --> 55:08.472
You're sounding all kind of
crazy right now, Cane.

55:08.472 --> 55:11.308
Sounding all crazy, huh?

55:11.308 --> 55:13.811
You had all these fucking
months to find Zeke's killer,

55:13.811 --> 55:16.981
but I had no fucking problem
finding Mecca's pilot,

55:16.981 --> 55:19.617
and you know what he saw
the night of the shooting?

55:19.617 --> 55:24.355
Said he saw a bald guy,
dark jacket,

55:24.355 --> 55:25.890
broken taillight.

55:25.890 --> 55:26.957
That was you, motherfucker.

55:26.957 --> 55:28.592
Slow your fucking roll, Cane.

55:28.592 --> 55:31.395
Zeke never wore that ring.

55:31.395 --> 55:33.898
I even double-checked
that shit on his IG.

55:33.898 --> 55:36.934
So there's no way it was on him
when he got got.

55:36.934 --> 55:39.437
I'm guessing it was
in that box of his shit

55:39.437 --> 55:41.939
Monet can't bring herself
to open.

55:41.939 --> 55:45.042
But what really did it
for me was the fucking look

55:45.042 --> 55:47.978
on your face when that Guap
said he was hired to jump Dru.

55:49.513 --> 55:50.648
All that time inside,
you'd think you'd have

55:50.648 --> 55:53.117
a better fucking poker face.

55:53.350 --> 55:54.919
You stole Zeke's ring,

55:54.919 --> 55:56.654
you set up this nigga
to jump my brother,

55:56.654 --> 55:59.623
then you planted that shit
when you paid him off.

55:59.623 --> 56:02.760
How else would he know Dru was
the one that killed Lil' Guap?

56:02.760 --> 56:04.562
It had to be somebody
in the family,

56:04.562 --> 56:06.864
but the one thing
I cannot figure out is why.

56:06.864 --> 56:08.699
You got me all fucked up, Cane.

56:10.367 --> 56:11.836
How about I run all this
by Monet, see what she think?

56:11.836 --> 56:13.571
- It was a fucking mistake.
- Nah. A fucking mistake?

56:13.571 --> 56:14.705
Yeah, it was. I fucked up.

56:14.705 --> 56:16.507
I thought your mother was--

56:19.009 --> 56:20.811
Zeke was in Mecca's car,

56:20.811 --> 56:24.048
getting into Mecca's jet,
so I thought he was Mecca.

56:24.048 --> 56:26.817
I was doing what I need to do
to protect our family,

56:26.817 --> 56:29.620
like I always will.

56:29.620 --> 56:34.058
But I would never, never hurt
your mother like that, man.

56:40.064 --> 56:44.401
That's even more stupid
and pathetic than I thought.

56:44.401 --> 56:46.137
Get the fuck off me, man.

56:46.137 --> 56:47.538
All this time,
you thinking I'm not ready

56:47.538 --> 56:49.940
for the fucking throne?

56:52.877 --> 56:54.779
But you weren't ready for me,

56:54.779 --> 56:58.716
and now that I know the truth,
I fucking own you.

57:00.584 --> 57:03.087
So this Noma weight
we talked about earlier?

57:03.087 --> 57:05.623
You're gonna move it.

57:08.726 --> 57:10.194
