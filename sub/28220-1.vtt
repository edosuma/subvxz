<i>I saw an angel
standin' in the sun...</i>

02:11.421 --> 02:13.522
<i>and he shouted aloud
to all the birds</i>

02:13.524 --> 02:15.325

03:19.556 --> 03:21.025
<i>This one's for Thomas.</i>

03:21.657 --> 03:22.759
This one's...

03:23.894 --> 03:24.861
for Mama.

03:31.033 --> 03:32.002
I'll be off now.

03:33.036 --> 03:35.506
- How's the baby?
- Sleeping.

03:41.711 --> 03:42.713
Bye!

03:53.490 --> 03:56.060
<i>"God is our refuge
and strength.</i>

03:56.860 --> 03:58.696
Therefore do not fear,

03:59.462 --> 04:03.900
there is a river whose streams
make glad the City of God,

04:04.600 --> 04:07.035
the holy place
where the Most High dwell."

04:07.037 --> 04:08.039
Amen.

04:08.972 --> 04:10.074
Thank you.

04:28.858 --> 04:29.993
Goodnight, Papa.

04:35.632 --> 04:36.800
Goodnight, sweetheart.

04:37.968 --> 04:39.437
Goodnight, Papa.

04:51.615 --> 04:52.583
- Hey.
- Hey.

04:54.817 --> 04:57.885
How's my wonderful niece
and nephew?

04:57.887 --> 04:59.654
- How are you?
- Good. And you?

04:59.656 --> 05:01.490
- Glad you're good.
- How are you, my darling?

05:01.492 --> 05:03.494
All right. Are we goin' in?

05:23.613 --> 05:24.381
It has come...

05:25.815 --> 05:27.848
to my attention
that certain people

05:27.850 --> 05:29.019
in this congregation...

05:30.620 --> 05:33.223
are questioning whether
we made the right decision...

05:34.557 --> 05:36.461
when we banished alcohol...

05:37.661 --> 05:39.230
gambling, and whores...

05:40.730 --> 05:41.766
from this town.

05:46.069 --> 05:48.572
Business has suffered,
there's no denyin' that.

05:52.642 --> 05:55.479
But who in this room...

05:56.812 --> 05:59.050
would return to the way it was?

06:00.783 --> 06:01.786
Who?

06:03.286 --> 06:04.621
Which one of you...

06:05.555 --> 06:06.623
would choose sin...

06:07.690 --> 06:08.959
over the way of the Lord?

06:10.826 --> 06:11.829
Stand up!

06:13.896 --> 06:15.632
Stand up now
and show yourselves!

06:22.172 --> 06:25.240
When those of us who founded
this town first came here,

06:25.242 --> 06:27.177
the land was crawling
with savages.

06:27.644 --> 06:29.209
But, with the help
of the U.S. Cavalry,

06:29.211 --> 06:30.747
we cleared this land.

06:32.081 --> 06:33.550
Oh, it was...

06:34.317 --> 06:36.253
a sometimes horrific...

06:37.954 --> 06:39.286
and frightenin' task

06:39.288 --> 06:43.560
but we did not hesitate
for a moment because we knew

06:43.994 --> 06:46.998
our town would be a holy town!

06:48.732 --> 06:52.203
Here, in Garlow,
we are a shining example

06:52.802 --> 06:57.942
to all America of what
a true Christian town can be.

07:00.776 --> 07:01.846
America.

07:04.714 --> 07:05.849
America!

07:08.050 --> 07:09.086
It's a new country.

07:10.220 --> 07:13.988
We have an opportunity
to make it a heaven or a hell!

07:15.692 --> 07:18.295
We can make it a paradise
here on Earth...

07:19.930 --> 07:23.000
where all men are treated equal

07:23.233 --> 07:25.800
where no man wants for food
or shelter

07:25.802 --> 07:28.670
where we all work
for a common good

07:28.672 --> 07:31.943
and our entire lives
are in praise of the Lord.

07:32.309 --> 07:35.043
And here, in Garlow,
is where it all begins.

07:35.045 --> 07:36.781
I can see it!

07:37.380 --> 07:39.282
It is beautiful!

07:45.122 --> 07:46.357
Before we go...

07:48.024 --> 07:49.356
I'd like to remind you

07:49.358 --> 07:52.360
that the Garlow Women's
Christian Temperance League

07:52.362 --> 07:54.428
led by my loving wife, Maria,

07:54.430 --> 07:57.932
will have hot soup
and freshly baked bread

07:57.934 --> 07:59.770
ready for everyone
who's attended this sermon.

08:00.704 --> 08:03.674
And now, if you please stand
we'll sing the hymn,

08:04.307 --> 08:06.140
"The Shining Shore."

08:06.142 --> 08:11.245
<i>♪ My days
Are gliding swiftly by ♪</i>

08:11.247 --> 08:12.813
Get back here right now!

08:12.815 --> 08:15.183
<i>♪ And I a pilgrim stranger... ♪</i>

08:15.185 --> 08:17.851
Stop it! Get back here!

08:17.853 --> 08:19.856
Hey. Hey, you be careful!

08:20.257 --> 08:21.858
Don't go knockin' anyone over.

08:23.694 --> 08:25.459
You know, Elsa and I,

08:25.461 --> 08:27.896
we... we kinda think of them
as our own, so,

08:27.898 --> 08:30.432
you know, anytime you and Audrey
want some time alone,

08:30.434 --> 08:31.902
just give us a holler.

08:32.302 --> 08:33.937
We'll be glad to look after them
for ya.

08:34.705 --> 08:37.140
Hell, you can keep 'em.

08:49.720 --> 08:53.157
So, um, I will need,
uh, some jerky.

08:53.423 --> 08:54.855
Do you still have some?

08:56.393 --> 08:59.263
Um, I mean, I need some...

09:00.330 --> 09:01.331
This one here.

09:02.499 --> 09:03.734
That one.

09:07.003 --> 09:08.469
I like that gun the best.

09:08.471 --> 09:11.039
Emma, don't touch it.
Never touch a gun.

09:11.041 --> 09:12.339
Why don't you get
a gun, Pa?

09:12.341 --> 09:14.711
I have a gun. My rifle.

09:15.778 --> 09:16.846
But you should get a new one.

09:18.081 --> 09:19.446
It would be good if Indians
come back and try and kill us.

09:21.384 --> 09:22.753
I think we'll be all right.

09:25.355 --> 09:27.191
Do you have some of that rice?

09:27.823 --> 09:30.394
- Rice? Certainly. Over here.
- Yeah. Great.

09:34.063 --> 09:35.131
You stop me.

09:36.066 --> 09:37.935
What?

09:42.639 --> 09:44.408
Yes, I'll be with you
in a minute, sir.

09:45.942 --> 09:46.911
Thank you.

09:52.883 --> 09:54.285
So, let's see.

10:34.591 --> 10:37.327
Now, who in the hell was that?

10:40.330 --> 10:41.930
Everybody on Papa!

10:41.932 --> 10:42.930
- Come on!
- No!

10:42.932 --> 10:45.400
- Oh, no.
- Yeah! Yes!

10:45.402 --> 10:47.471
Yeah, I got him!

10:48.304 --> 10:50.306
Aye, you got me.

10:50.874 --> 10:53.174
You children get washed up now.

10:53.176 --> 10:54.608
I washed up earlier.

10:54.610 --> 10:56.310
That was this morning.

10:56.312 --> 10:58.048
Oh, you're covered in mud.
Look at you.

10:59.416 --> 11:00.551
But if I wash up any more,

11:01.051 --> 11:02.820
there ain't gonna be nothing
left of me.

11:03.385 --> 11:05.052
I heard that, mister!

11:05.054 --> 11:06.055
- Caught ya!
- Hey!

11:07.890 --> 11:09.894
- I'm gonna get you.
- You can't catch me.

11:11.528 --> 11:14.230
Hyah!

11:18.869 --> 11:20.334
Don't you think it's time
we finally finish

11:20.336 --> 11:23.506
what we started and headed
all the way out to California?

11:24.506 --> 11:27.043
Why? I thought
you liked it here.

11:27.878 --> 11:29.947
I do, but...

11:30.947 --> 11:32.582
...this isn't the same town
that we stopped in.

11:33.549 --> 11:35.385
You know, business was good
back then, remember?

11:36.385 --> 11:39.055
The saloon was busy.
The town was full...

11:39.623 --> 11:40.891
all the time. But...

11:41.591 --> 11:42.525
now?

11:43.192 --> 11:44.461
We're happy here, aren't we?

11:46.196 --> 11:47.498
We don't want for anything.

11:50.366 --> 11:51.568
Business will pick up.

11:53.168 --> 11:54.103
But if it doesn't,

11:55.071 --> 11:56.874
there's always a chance
we could go hungry.

11:57.640 --> 11:58.975
That's not gonna happen.

12:00.076 --> 12:02.879
There will always be enough job
to get by.

12:08.652 --> 12:11.051
I just can't help but feelin'
that we're bein' left behind,

12:11.053 --> 12:12.021
you know?

12:12.989 --> 12:14.258
Like we're missin' out.

12:19.195 --> 12:21.065
And we're so close, Audrey.

12:22.164 --> 12:25.568
Just over those mountains.
In two months, we'd be there.

12:29.038 --> 12:31.609
No. We can't just abandon
the place.

12:32.575 --> 12:34.879
We put so much effort
into building it up.

12:43.219 --> 12:44.153
It'll pick up.

12:44.988 --> 12:45.890
You'll see.

13:03.472 --> 13:04.440
Come on, boy!

13:05.408 --> 13:07.177
Come on!

13:15.351 --> 13:16.286
Come, boy.

13:17.388 --> 13:20.024
- Don't let me down.
- What's wrong with the horse?

13:20.623 --> 13:21.959
I think he's sick.

13:28.163 --> 13:30.100
Is he gonna die?

13:31.533 --> 13:32.937
I don't know, sweetheart.

13:34.070 --> 13:37.274
- I think so.
- I don't want him to die.

13:38.541 --> 13:39.443
I know you don't.

13:40.376 --> 13:41.411
None of us do.

13:42.044 --> 13:44.145
Can I put flowers on his coffin?

13:44.147 --> 13:45.950
Horses don't have coffins,
silly.

13:46.383 --> 13:48.181
- Why not?
- They just don't.

13:48.183 --> 13:50.450
- How would they fit in them?
- Papa can make one,

13:50.452 --> 13:51.587
can't you, Papa?

13:52.288 --> 13:54.457
Hmm. Thomas is right.

13:55.625 --> 13:57.094
He's too big for a coffin.

13:57.726 --> 13:59.196
Okay, come on.

13:59.596 --> 14:01.465
Come on, children.
Let's go back inside.

14:01.697 --> 14:04.000
Can I kiss him goodbye, first?

14:04.801 --> 14:05.735
Sure.

14:08.504 --> 14:10.740
Bye. Thanks for carrying me
on your back.

14:14.244 --> 14:16.109
- Goodbye.
- Goodnight, Sheriff.

14:16.111 --> 14:17.680
- Goodnight, Mrs. Tate.
- Bye.

14:19.716 --> 14:21.284
Do you want me to stay with you,
Pa?

14:22.552 --> 14:23.553
It's all right, son.

14:24.754 --> 14:26.090
You go on inside.

14:43.673 --> 14:44.640
Here.

14:45.707 --> 14:46.610
You can use this.

14:58.455 --> 15:00.124
I can do it if you want me to.

15:02.658 --> 15:04.093
No, it's all right.

15:05.227 --> 15:06.129
I'll do it.

16:00.884 --> 16:02.782
We're lookin' for a man
named Bill Crabtree.

16:02.784 --> 16:03.754
Do you know him?

16:06.456 --> 16:08.388
Far as I know,
he left a few months back

16:08.390 --> 16:11.094
but his wife lives
over the other side of town.

16:13.263 --> 16:14.398
Can you show us where?

16:16.298 --> 16:18.168
Yeah, you ride
straight through there,

16:18.600 --> 16:20.700
up through the town there,
to the left, there.

16:20.702 --> 16:23.339
No, no, no, no!
You come with us and show us.

16:23.840 --> 16:25.843
I can't.
My wife is waitin' for me.

16:26.341 --> 16:28.377
Climb on up here
and take us there.

16:29.678 --> 16:30.847
I said I can't.

16:34.918 --> 16:37.218
How about if we come in there
and we ask your wife

16:37.220 --> 16:38.422
to show us where he lives?

16:54.236 --> 16:55.905
Climb up, son.
Don't make me ask you again.

17:26.769 --> 17:29.272
Mrs. Crabtree,

17:29.771 --> 17:31.274
I'm sorry, but these men...

17:42.285 --> 17:43.617
Mommy! Oh, Mommy! No!

17:43.619 --> 17:44.887
No!

17:50.026 --> 17:51.195
Where's Bill?

17:53.395 --> 17:54.364
He's not here.

17:58.268 --> 17:59.502
Well, where did he go?

17:59.801 --> 18:00.971
I don't know.

18:01.637 --> 18:02.905
- You sure?
- Yeah.

18:03.439 --> 18:05.409
He's not here. I swear.

18:08.377 --> 18:09.545
You won't find him here.

18:10.747 --> 18:11.946
He up and left us.

18:11.948 --> 18:13.717
We haven't seen him
in over a year.

18:18.587 --> 18:19.855
What do you want Bill for?

18:20.990 --> 18:22.692
Bill's got a price on his head.

18:23.558 --> 18:25.962
He killed a guard
and an old man, too.

18:27.563 --> 18:28.865
Your daddy's a bank robber.

18:29.632 --> 18:31.301
No. That can't be.

18:31.768 --> 18:32.970
Bill's no killer.

18:34.070 --> 18:36.804
He's been travelin' with a...
with a half-breed Injun

18:36.806 --> 18:37.908
named Cherokee Thomson.

18:38.941 --> 18:41.377
No, it can't be.

18:41.810 --> 18:42.812
Oh, no, no.

18:43.680 --> 18:45.481
It be, Ms. Crabtree. It be.

18:46.015 --> 18:47.748
Sometimes I think
the whole world

18:47.750 --> 18:49.519
is strung together by lies.

18:50.787 --> 18:52.655
But I'm not gonna lie to you,
ma'am.

18:54.057 --> 18:55.692
I'm gonna kill your husband.

18:57.492 --> 18:58.761
I'm gonna get up real close

18:59.095 --> 19:00.663
and if I get a good shot...

19:00.997 --> 19:02.699
I'm gonna blow his head
clean off.

19:05.934 --> 19:08.304
But don't take it personal,
'cause he had it comin'.

19:09.439 --> 19:10.673
Believe me when I tell ya.

19:38.534 --> 19:40.937
So, where can a man get a drink
in this shithole?

20:06.596 --> 20:08.832
Saw the sign outside.

20:09.731 --> 20:11.701
Crossed out "bar".
Why'd you close the bar?

20:12.535 --> 20:15.436
Preacher Pike and
the Christian Temperance League

20:15.438 --> 20:18.773
make me do it. They said
a... alcohol and whores was a sin

20:18.775 --> 20:21.574
and unless I closed up,
they'd burn it d... down.

20:21.576 --> 20:23.747
B... b... b... bur... burn it down?

20:24.646 --> 20:25.816
There a law in this town?

20:27.048 --> 20:29.418
The preacher runs the town.

20:29.885 --> 20:31.788
The sheriff ain't worth shit.

20:34.856 --> 20:37.793
Get another glass for my friend,
and um, leave the bottle.

20:41.463 --> 20:42.398
Sit down.

20:51.039 --> 20:52.008
Have a drink.

20:52.875 --> 20:55.476
I haven't had a drink
in four years.

20:55.478 --> 20:58.081
- My wife, we don't approve...
- Good thing she ain't here.

21:07.123 --> 21:08.125
It's nice.

21:11.126 --> 21:12.128
What's your name, son?

21:12.929 --> 21:13.830
Patrick Tate.

21:14.864 --> 21:15.999
My name's Dutch Albert.

21:17.200 --> 21:18.701
This here is Dumb-Dumb.

21:19.868 --> 21:20.870
Open your mouth.

21:23.873 --> 21:26.109
He got his tongue cut off
by a Comanche.

21:27.943 --> 21:29.479
I don't know why
he carries it around.

21:29.679 --> 21:30.647
He never told me.

21:39.154 --> 21:42.459
And this here is Sicily.
He loves to sing.

21:42.692 --> 21:45.495
Doesn't speak much English.
We think he's Italian.

21:45.795 --> 21:48.899
And you...

21:51.733 --> 21:53.669
- where you from?
- Ireland.

21:54.804 --> 21:55.772
What do you do?

21:56.571 --> 21:59.041
I'm a carpenter and undertaker.

21:59.709 --> 22:01.644
You're an Irish undertaker?

22:02.845 --> 22:05.081
- Bet you're Catholic, too, huh?
- Not anymore.

22:05.548 --> 22:08.050
Oh, they made you convert.
Did they?

22:10.019 --> 22:11.822
Oh, these decent
Christian folks...

22:12.688 --> 22:15.125
they don't like the Irish much,
do they? Why is that?

22:16.192 --> 22:18.659
'Cause they think too many
of you comin' over here

22:18.661 --> 22:19.895
and you's all a buncha rats.

22:22.664 --> 22:24.000
No better than the savages.

22:25.268 --> 22:26.769
That's how they think, isn't it?

22:28.703 --> 22:30.906
I bet they wouldn't even talk
to you unless you converted.

22:31.140 --> 22:33.509
- That right?
- Things are all right now.

22:33.942 --> 22:36.512
Yeah,
but you still Irish.

22:36.811 --> 22:37.947
You can't change that.

22:38.914 --> 22:40.149
And every time they look at you,

22:40.816 --> 22:42.184
they'll be reminded of death.

22:42.984 --> 22:43.986
They're gonna die.

22:44.854 --> 22:46.590
You'll always be an outsider
here.

22:46.923 --> 22:50.559
You'll never be one of 'em,
no matter what you do. Never.

22:51.192 --> 22:52.194
I understand that.

22:53.895 --> 22:54.897
What that's like.

22:57.333 --> 22:58.602
I understand you.

23:03.204 --> 23:04.707
We'd like to get some food now.

23:05.807 --> 23:08.612
All I got is sour belly
an... and coffee.

23:10.112 --> 23:12.883
The sign outside said, "hotel".

23:13.115 --> 23:15.085
Is this a fuckin' hotel?

23:16.085 --> 23:18.352
I... I have some chickens
in the backyard.

23:18.354 --> 23:20.624
I can try and catch one.

23:20.855 --> 23:22.725
- Fuckin' chickens?
- Yeah.

23:23.358 --> 23:24.727
E... eggs?

23:25.828 --> 23:27.795
Yeah, go ahead. You go chase
those fuckin' chickens!

23:27.797 --> 23:28.698
A... all right.

23:30.199 --> 23:32.102
You got a nice, pretty wife,
right?

23:35.237 --> 23:36.836
What do you say we
go to your place

23:36.838 --> 23:38.140
and she fixes us somethin'
to eat?

23:49.986 --> 23:51.087
What is it?

23:56.057 --> 23:58.028
Can't thank you enough
for this, ma'am.

24:00.395 --> 24:01.730
Well...

24:02.131 --> 24:03.363
it's not every day

24:03.365 --> 24:05.332
I have to get up
in the middle of the night

24:05.334 --> 24:07.804
and give food to strangers,
but...

24:08.336 --> 24:09.972
since you're here,
you're welcome.

24:10.705 --> 24:11.674
Where you from?

24:14.410 --> 24:16.846
Um...

24:17.712 --> 24:19.950
- I'm from France.
- French.

24:21.150 --> 24:22.285
I like the French.

24:23.019 --> 24:24.621
Good people, honest people.

24:27.088 --> 24:28.892
You know, your husband said,
you were pretty.

24:30.259 --> 24:31.728
That doesn't do you justice.

24:32.795 --> 24:33.897
No, siree, huh?

24:35.131 --> 24:36.333
You're downright beautiful.

24:37.666 --> 24:38.801
Ain't she, fellas?

24:48.943 --> 24:51.748
Why don't you go on back to bed,
Audrey. I'll clean up here.

24:51.946 --> 24:53.980
I think Dumb-Dumb
wants her to stay.

24:53.982 --> 24:56.051
Go, on, Audrey.

24:59.387 --> 25:02.088
Well, we haven't had
the pleasure of female company

25:02.090 --> 25:04.059
in a long time. Have we, boys?

25:06.829 --> 25:10.099
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I think I will go back to bed.

25:11.901 --> 25:14.234
As I said, we're not accustomed
to having visitors

25:14.236 --> 25:16.139
- at such a late hour.
- You got kids?

25:24.079 --> 25:25.814
- Yeah.
- How many?

25:28.183 --> 25:29.184
Two.

25:32.253 --> 25:33.389
Are they sleepin' now?

25:35.724 --> 25:36.859
Of course.

25:37.792 --> 25:38.794
Shh.

25:41.130 --> 25:43.233
Why don't you go back
to bed, Audrey.

25:46.801 --> 25:48.137
Well, we're sorry
for keepin' you up...

25:48.336 --> 25:49.305
Get the fuck up!

25:51.440 --> 25:53.873
We are sorry for keepin' you up
and we wanna thank you for-

25:53.875 --> 25:56.110
for your... for your food
and your company

25:56.112 --> 25:58.048
and for your
general hospitality.

26:09.357 --> 26:11.260
That's a hell of a wife
you got there, Pat.

26:14.997 --> 26:16.298
We about done here, boys?

26:20.935 --> 26:21.803
Thank you again, Pat.

26:23.071 --> 26:24.807
You don't mind
if I call you Pat, do you?

26:25.406 --> 26:27.007
- No.
- You got a nice thing

26:27.009 --> 26:27.943
goin' here.

26:29.778 --> 26:31.847
Nice house, nice family.

26:33.348 --> 26:34.483
Nice wife. The whole bit.

26:37.385 --> 26:40.255
Be seein' you around.

27:21.564 --> 27:22.532
Wake up!

27:30.905 --> 27:31.973
Here's how this is gonna go.

27:33.909 --> 27:36.276
I'm gonna buy this place
from you for a thousand dollars.

27:36.278 --> 27:37.547
You can stay on as a bartender.

27:38.012 --> 27:40.316
- Does that seem fair?
- Y... yeah.

27:41.016 --> 27:43.186
- You sure?
- I... I... I, yeah, I'm sure.

27:43.885 --> 27:46.189
Good. We reopen in a week.

27:47.522 --> 27:48.791
I want you to get a wagon...

27:50.125 --> 27:51.290
go over to Edna,

27:51.292 --> 27:52.961
and get as many whores
as you can, Jim.

27:55.096 --> 27:57.533
Wh... wh... what kind of whores
you like?

27:57.932 --> 27:59.134
What kind of whores do you want?

28:00.201 --> 28:02.204
Just good ones.
Ones you wanna fuck.

28:02.872 --> 28:04.974
Yeah? Good.

28:05.574 --> 28:06.843
We're friends now.

28:10.445 --> 28:11.914
Nice doin' business with you,
Jim.

28:12.314 --> 28:14.284
Y... yeah.

28:18.554 --> 28:20.923
Come here!

28:33.669 --> 28:36.306
Mr. Tate?

28:37.906 --> 28:38.841
Mr. Tate!

28:42.443 --> 28:45.514
There's been an accident
over a... a... at the saloon.

28:45.914 --> 28:47.850
- A... a... a man's dead.
- What's happened?

28:48.250 --> 28:50.182
A... a... an accident,
ma'am.

28:50.184 --> 28:51.620
A... a... a man's been killed.

28:52.453 --> 28:54.289
The Temperance League said
this would happen.

28:54.656 --> 28:56.489
This place should have
never been opened again.

28:56.491 --> 28:59.194
The saloon is open now
a... a... and it's open for good.

28:59.461 --> 29:02.629
So, y... you and the reverend
and all the little ladies

29:02.631 --> 29:03.633
over there in the league

29:04.900 --> 29:06.600
- better start accepting that...
- Don't patronize me, Mr. Emmett!

29:06.602 --> 29:08.905
Hey, hey.
Go back inside Audrey, okay?

29:09.137 --> 29:10.505
I better go.
The sheriff needs me.

29:10.972 --> 29:14.143
No. I won't be spoken to
like that, Patrick.

29:14.375 --> 29:15.642
Not by the likes of him,

29:15.644 --> 29:17.413
and especially not
in my own home.

29:18.012 --> 29:21.550
You're a lowlife, Mr. Emmett.
And a pretty dumb one at that.

29:22.217 --> 29:24.220
Do you feel proud of yourself,
Mr. Emmett?

29:24.420 --> 29:26.085
Making money off
the exploitation

29:26.087 --> 29:27.257
of vulnerable women?

29:27.556 --> 29:29.992
- Do you?
- Take no notice of him.

29:30.224 --> 29:32.294
Hey. I'll see you later.

29:37.532 --> 29:39.201
Can I come too, Pa?

29:40.702 --> 29:41.904
Not tonight, son.

30:14.569 --> 30:15.570
Who did it?

30:19.273 --> 30:21.076
- He fell down...
- That's bullshit!

30:22.144 --> 30:23.512
The man's got his head
kicked in.

30:24.246 --> 30:25.248
Who did it?

30:26.147 --> 30:27.482
He fell, Sheriff.
I... I... I swear it.

30:28.017 --> 30:30.053
He... he... he was drunk.
He... he fell.

30:41.563 --> 30:44.367
Anyone in here wanna tell me
what happened to this man?

30:54.509 --> 30:56.679
What, none of you
sons-of-bitches knows a thing?

30:58.079 --> 30:59.448
No one knows anything?

31:01.583 --> 31:03.419
All of a sudden,
we're all deaf and dumb?

31:13.429 --> 31:14.263
Try this one more time.
Who did it?

31:16.298 --> 31:17.596
- Told you, Sheriff...
- Yeah, yeah,

31:17.598 --> 31:19.301
- he fell down the stairs.
- Yeah.

31:19.835 --> 31:20.769
Bullshit.

31:21.636 --> 31:23.105
I wanna go home.

31:33.315 --> 31:34.350
Who is he?

31:35.217 --> 31:36.219
Don't know.

31:37.318 --> 31:38.721
Nobody knows him.

31:41.289 --> 31:43.026
Better just put an "X"
on his grave.

31:46.095 --> 31:47.096
Thanks, Patrick.

32:32.207 --> 32:34.110
<i>None of us here knew this man</i>

32:34.409 --> 32:37.580
but we all know he died
a violent death...

32:38.779 --> 32:41.183
at the hands of evil men.

32:42.718 --> 32:45.087
And they need to be punished,
Sheriff.

32:45.420 --> 32:48.255
Hang 'em, drive them outta town,
whip 'em,

32:48.257 --> 32:51.160
do whatever you have to do
but you gotta do somethin'

32:51.593 --> 32:53.830
before they drag this town
into hell!

32:55.163 --> 32:56.798
You know
I can't do that, Reverend.

32:57.465 --> 32:59.134
I can only act within the law.

32:59.500 --> 33:00.635
What about the law of God?

33:01.569 --> 33:02.871
"Thou shalt not kill."

33:03.471 --> 33:05.273
This is not the time or place
for this.

33:05.941 --> 33:08.307
Not the time or place?

33:08.309 --> 33:12.278
We're standing over the grave
of a murdered man.

33:12.280 --> 33:14.884
I'm gonna go.
I've got some work to do.

33:15.517 --> 33:16.749
You wanna come by
the office later?

33:16.751 --> 33:18.552
I'll explain to you
just how the law works.

33:18.554 --> 33:19.555
What work?

33:19.954 --> 33:21.490
Hiding in your office?

33:22.457 --> 33:25.261
I know the law too, Sheriff!
"Thou shalt not kill!

33:25.693 --> 33:28.196
Thou shalt not kill", Sheriff!

34:16.344 --> 34:17.413
Saint Patrick.

34:19.514 --> 34:21.918
In need of your services
for a private funeral.

34:22.684 --> 34:24.652
Would that be of interest
to you?

34:25.320 --> 34:27.322
- Private funeral?
- Mm-hmm.

34:27.521 --> 34:29.291
- When?
- Now.

34:30.391 --> 34:31.393
Now?

34:31.960 --> 34:33.262
Is that a problem?

34:34.929 --> 34:35.931
Who died?

34:40.335 --> 34:41.637
I'll need two coffins.

35:37.425 --> 35:38.494
Irish.

35:43.398 --> 35:44.333
Irish.

35:50.838 --> 35:51.873
Irish.

35:53.007 --> 35:54.009
Bill.

35:56.878 --> 35:57.880
Wake up, now.

35:59.681 --> 36:00.682
You still with us?

36:01.750 --> 36:03.518
I been to see your family, Bill.

36:04.853 --> 36:06.055
I'm gonna take good care of 'em.

36:06.621 --> 36:08.356
If you touch 'em, I'll kill ya.

36:08.690 --> 36:10.793
You got your guts hangin' out
all over the place.

36:11.126 --> 36:12.595
You got maybe two minutes left.

36:13.027 --> 36:15.128
- Don't embarrass yourself, Bill.
- Oh, Jesus.

36:15.130 --> 36:17.500
- We should try and help him.
- Jesus Christ.

36:18.032 --> 36:19.735
Why is the undertaker here?

36:20.001 --> 36:21.367
He's here to bury you, Bill.

36:21.369 --> 36:22.735
- No.
- Don't thank me.

36:22.737 --> 36:23.970
I know you'd do
the same for me.

36:23.972 --> 36:24.907
No.

36:27.108 --> 36:28.541
These men used to be friends
of mine.

36:28.543 --> 36:29.876
- No.
- Just in case you think

36:29.878 --> 36:31.580
this is cold-blooded murder,
it ain't.

36:32.414 --> 36:34.380
- They stole from me.
- Oh.

36:34.382 --> 36:35.981
I warned 'em not to
but they did it, anyway.

36:35.983 --> 36:37.552
- Please.
- And they deserve a...

36:37.918 --> 36:40.052
- a good Christian burial.
- No. Wait, wait, wait!

36:42.056 --> 36:43.391
Now, let's get 'em buried.

37:10.918 --> 37:11.920
I envy you.

37:14.422 --> 37:15.623
Doin' what you do for a livin'.

37:16.625 --> 37:17.760
Workin' with your hands.

37:21.963 --> 37:22.898
You know, when you're done,

37:23.998 --> 37:24.866
you really feel like
you did an honest day's work.

37:31.739 --> 37:32.774
Show me your hands.

37:38.012 --> 37:39.382
See?

37:40.916 --> 37:42.852
- Look at those hands.
- Oh.

37:43.918 --> 37:45.019
Honest hands.

37:47.889 --> 37:48.990
Worker's hands.

37:56.998 --> 37:58.134
Do you think a decent...

37:59.067 --> 38:00.666
guy like you with honest hands

38:00.668 --> 38:02.170
could be friends
with a guy like me?

38:10.478 --> 38:13.114
- I really don't know.
- I think we could.

38:27.661 --> 38:30.565
Will you, Patrick...
what's your second name?

38:31.932 --> 38:34.036
- Tate.
- Will you, Patrick Tate...

38:35.103 --> 38:36.172
take me...

38:36.972 --> 38:38.774
Christopher Dutch Albert...

38:40.675 --> 38:41.811
to be your friend?

38:55.789 --> 38:56.791
Sure.

38:58.760 --> 39:00.095
Look, boys, we got a new friend.

39:03.731 --> 39:04.733
Life's a riddle.

39:06.800 --> 39:08.103
We kill two old friends

39:08.769 --> 39:10.505
and straight away,
we make another one.

39:24.652 --> 39:26.087
Nice doin' business
with ya, Pat.

40:53.407 --> 40:54.342
I'll call.

40:55.376 --> 40:56.844
I got two kings.

40:59.079 --> 41:00.014
Thank you.

41:04.952 --> 41:06.688
<i>"And when
they had mocked him...</i>

41:06.887 --> 41:08.257
they took his robe...

41:09.023 --> 41:09.991
off him...

41:10.992 --> 41:13.262
and led him away
to be crucified."

41:13.795 --> 41:16.699
Good boy.
Don't fuckin' push me. I never...

41:17.097 --> 41:19.802
Oh, fuck you, Phillip!

41:21.235 --> 41:23.838
Let us sing a hymn.

41:24.806 --> 41:26.008
Let us sing...

41:27.242 --> 41:29.077
loud and clear so that...

41:29.677 --> 41:31.679
the good Lord will hear us...

41:32.746 --> 41:34.112
above the sinners.

41:34.114 --> 41:36.050
Call.

41:36.251 --> 41:37.319
Flush.

41:39.987 --> 41:41.920
Thanks, gentlemen.
I'm gonna call it a night.

41:41.922 --> 41:43.722
If you guys could cash me out
for your chips,

41:43.724 --> 41:44.692
I'd appreciate that.

41:51.099 --> 41:52.001
What's wrong, boy?

41:53.702 --> 41:55.771
- I don't have enough.
- You don't have my money?

41:56.103 --> 41:57.038
Not all of it.

41:58.072 --> 41:59.741
We play on an honor system here

41:59.974 --> 42:02.378
and nobody leaves the table
unless they pay.

42:02.811 --> 42:03.979
I can go home and get it.

42:04.244 --> 42:05.110
But you wouldn't come back.

42:05.112 --> 42:07.146
- I will. I swear.
- No, you won't.

42:07.148 --> 42:08.815
I will! I swear,
you get a Bible in here...

42:08.817 --> 42:10.652
What the fuck would I be doing
with a Bible, son?

42:12.019 --> 42:13.054
Now, I want my money.

42:13.989 --> 42:16.222
I'll come back with your money.
I promise.

42:16.224 --> 42:17.724
No you won't.
I wouldn't blame ya.

42:17.726 --> 42:18.727
I wouldn't either.

42:19.126 --> 42:20.128
Well, I'm different, sir.

42:20.360 --> 42:22.128
Different? You're different how?

42:22.130 --> 42:23.195
- You're different than me?
- Yeah.

42:23.197 --> 42:25.433
- You just call me a thief?
- No. No, sir, I ain't.

42:26.934 --> 42:28.036
I want my money, son.

42:34.742 --> 42:36.679
You made a big mistake
pullin' that gun...

42:38.112 --> 42:39.313
'cause now you have to use it.

42:39.914 --> 42:41.383
I could just walk on
outta here, sir.

42:43.384 --> 42:44.950
I'll get you the money
when I can.

42:44.952 --> 42:46.688
Well, it's not about
the money now.

42:46.920 --> 42:49.188
My momma,
she's gonna be waitin' for me

42:49.190 --> 42:50.224
when I get home.

42:52.760 --> 42:53.795
Please don't kill me, sir.

42:54.963 --> 42:56.795
Let the Lord hear us!

43:00.802 --> 43:02.434
- Patrick, don't go.
- I'll be right back.

43:02.436 --> 43:04.403
Don't let sin...
Don't let the devil

43:04.405 --> 43:05.740
into this church!

43:09.844 --> 43:12.414
The boy pulled a gun
on Mr. Albert.

43:15.817 --> 43:17.186
What age you reckon this boy is?

43:17.818 --> 43:19.755
Old enough to own a gun.

43:20.989 --> 43:21.923
He's 18.

43:28.563 --> 43:30.132
Feel good killin' a kid, did it?

43:30.431 --> 43:31.900
Felt neither good nor bad.

43:32.800 --> 43:33.869
It was self-defense.

43:36.503 --> 43:37.772
Is that the way it happened?

43:41.208 --> 43:43.111
Anyone see things
any differently?

43:44.978 --> 43:47.849
Or was it as Dutch Albert says?
Self-defense?

43:52.920 --> 43:54.056
Take care of the kid, will ya?

43:56.157 --> 43:57.192
I'll pay ya later.

43:58.126 --> 43:59.328
Got another grave to dig.

44:15.342 --> 44:17.142
"And he will enter
the kingdom of heaven

44:17.144 --> 44:19.081
and sit at the right hand
of Christ."

44:19.880 --> 44:20.782
Amen.

44:24.085 --> 44:26.485
Rest assured,
these men will be punished

44:26.487 --> 44:31.159
when God will damn them to hell
forever, eternity.

45:18.505 --> 45:20.174
Mama, can I have some candy?

45:20.375 --> 45:21.909
No, you can't have any.

45:24.077 --> 45:25.179
Soap to wash clothes?

45:25.612 --> 45:28.246
Yes. Please.
Do... do you still have some,

45:28.248 --> 45:30.251
you know,
the same like last time?

45:30.652 --> 45:31.983
Yes.

45:31.985 --> 45:33.154
- We'll need that.
- There you go.

45:34.222 --> 45:35.354
I think a handful
will be enough.

45:35.356 --> 45:37.023
- One handful. Okay.
- Yes.

45:53.641 --> 45:54.876
I don't understand you.

46:01.949 --> 46:03.085
Get your hand off me!

46:03.518 --> 46:05.184
Mama!

46:05.186 --> 46:07.356
You are frightening
the child, Mister.

46:26.440 --> 46:28.542
- Mama?
- It's all right, Emma.

46:42.389 --> 46:44.425
<i>That man was
in the store again today.</i>

46:46.027 --> 46:48.664
- What man?
- That man, Dumb-Dumb.

46:49.664 --> 46:51.333
He tried to touch my face.

46:54.635 --> 46:55.938
He wouldn't have hurt ya.

46:57.271 --> 46:59.608
How can you say that?
He's a murderer.

47:02.677 --> 47:04.413
Do you know what frightened me
the most?

47:05.346 --> 47:06.380
What?

47:07.614 --> 47:08.549
I just froze.

47:09.416 --> 47:10.485
I couldn't even move.

47:12.253 --> 47:14.588
All I wanted to do
was get Emma out of there.

47:15.123 --> 47:16.325
But I didn't know how.

47:17.324 --> 47:18.492
If he had done something,

47:18.760 --> 47:20.662
I'm not sure
I could have done anything.

47:22.295 --> 47:23.731
Nothin' would've happened,
Audrey.

47:26.034 --> 47:27.135
All right?

47:28.503 --> 47:30.238
Mama, can I have an apple?

47:31.539 --> 47:33.608
Yes, sweetheart.
Take one for Thomas, too.

47:33.807 --> 47:35.076
Yes, Mama.

47:37.344 --> 47:39.113
Don't worry about anything.

47:41.416 --> 47:42.417
I'll take care of ya.

48:08.076 --> 48:09.211
<i>È stupido.</i>

48:09.811 --> 48:12.079
Stupid man.

48:12.646 --> 48:14.181
Mr. Albert?

48:15.849 --> 48:17.052
Yes, ma'am?

48:17.818 --> 48:19.054
Could I talk to you?

48:19.853 --> 48:20.755
Sure.

48:21.588 --> 48:23.125
In... in private?

48:23.657 --> 48:25.027
Of course.

48:25.559 --> 48:29.163
Senora.

48:39.840 --> 48:41.143
I, uh...

48:42.476 --> 48:44.712
- Speak up.
- I wanna come and work for you.

48:46.746 --> 48:48.582
Doin' what, exactly?

48:51.652 --> 48:54.088
- Oh. We're not hiring right now.
- Please.

48:54.454 --> 48:55.523
Please, I beg you.

48:56.525 --> 48:57.822
I beg you. Me and my daughter,
we are starving.

48:57.824 --> 48:58.759
That's not my fault.

49:00.561 --> 49:02.497
That's your fault for marryin'
Bill Crabtree.

49:03.498 --> 49:07.469
Who was a treacherous, lying,
thieving son-of-a-bitch.

49:10.637 --> 49:13.307
Second, how the fuck
could I trust you?

49:13.840 --> 49:15.907
You'd steal from me first chance
you got, just like Bill.

49:15.909 --> 49:17.645
- Yes, you would.
- No, I wouldn't.

49:18.646 --> 49:19.414
I'm not Bill.

49:21.516 --> 49:23.548
I will never steal from you,
I swear.

49:23.550 --> 49:24.351
You swear to God?

49:25.253 --> 49:26.788
- Yeah.
- Why don't you go to the church?

49:27.221 --> 49:28.222
Pass around the coffers?

49:29.190 --> 49:31.259
- It doesn't want to help me.
- Oh.

49:31.791 --> 49:33.094
Turned you down, did they?

49:33.894 --> 49:36.230
Please. I don't care about me
but...

49:37.364 --> 49:38.866
but my daughter
shouldn't have to starve.

49:43.336 --> 49:45.905
All right, why don't you throw
your daughter into the deal here

49:45.907 --> 49:47.509
and we can try to work
somethin' out.

49:48.409 --> 49:49.344
My daughter?

49:50.210 --> 49:51.212
- Yeah.
- No.

49:52.313 --> 49:53.047
She's just a child.

49:55.382 --> 49:58.784
Please. I... I will work
very hard.

49:58.786 --> 50:00.889
I swear to God.
But not my daughter.

50:01.521 --> 50:03.858
- You a religious woman?
- Yes. I love the Lord.

50:04.425 --> 50:07.492
Good. You just keep your faith
in the Lord

50:07.494 --> 50:09.697
and go home, go to sleep,
starve to death.

50:10.530 --> 50:12.134
When you wake up,
you'll be in paradise.

50:14.601 --> 50:16.471
I can't turn a profit
on just you.

50:18.940 --> 50:20.275
Those are your choices.

50:20.541 --> 50:22.177
Let me know what you wanna do.

50:23.677 --> 50:24.846
Thank you for stoppin' by.

50:50.838 --> 50:53.642
Pa, when will you teach me
how to shoot that rifle again?

50:54.942 --> 50:57.646
Oh, I'll take you out
soon enough.

50:59.313 --> 51:00.347
Howdy!

51:02.916 --> 51:03.918
Hey!

51:04.885 --> 51:05.820
Howdy.

51:07.788 --> 51:08.956
How you folks doing?

51:09.690 --> 51:10.789
Good.

51:10.791 --> 51:12.394
My name's Anthony Peale,

51:12.592 --> 51:14.325
and this here is my wife,
Dorothy.

51:14.327 --> 51:15.262
Patrick Tate.

51:16.130 --> 51:17.432
- You headed to California?
- Sure are.

51:17.797 --> 51:19.200
Gonna make our fortune there.

51:19.800 --> 51:21.336
- Best of luck to ya.
- Thank you.

51:21.768 --> 51:22.736
Thank you, kindly.

51:23.603 --> 51:25.906
Hey, uh,
is there a saloon around here?

51:27.507 --> 51:31.709
Uh, yeah, we got, um,
Dutch Albert's in town.

51:31.711 --> 51:32.681
Thank goodness for that.

51:33.815 --> 51:34.813
You know, I thought I wouldn't
have me another whiskey

51:34.815 --> 51:36.717
until we got all the way over
them mountains.

51:37.050 --> 51:38.784
You're only having
the one, mind.

51:38.786 --> 51:41.255
That's fine by me.
One's all I need.

51:41.822 --> 51:43.557
Well, I'll be seein' you.

51:43.923 --> 51:45.994
- Best of luck to you.
- Walk on there, boys.

51:56.704 --> 51:58.640
- Bye!
- Bye!

52:17.057 --> 52:19.960
I want Mommy.

52:23.797 --> 52:25.664
I want Mommy!

52:25.666 --> 52:28.870
I want Mommy.

52:33.474 --> 52:34.709
I want Mommy.

52:40.380 --> 52:41.915
I want Mommy.

53:04.871 --> 53:06.070
I bought us some presents.

53:06.072 --> 53:07.139
- Presents!
- Presents!

53:07.141 --> 53:09.974
Yeah. Some of that
expensive candy from the store.

53:09.976 --> 53:11.378
Don't open it 'til after dinner.

53:11.612 --> 53:13.014
What's all this?

53:13.813 --> 53:14.915
And this is for you.

53:24.891 --> 53:27.428
It's beautiful, Mama.

53:27.894 --> 53:29.998
Schuster ordered it in
from New York City.

53:30.398 --> 53:32.567
I told him not to tell ya.
I wanted it to be a surprise.

53:34.768 --> 53:35.703
What's wrong?

53:36.804 --> 53:39.039
What would people think
if I wore this around town?

53:40.074 --> 53:41.443
What would they think of us?

53:42.175 --> 53:43.110
What do you mean?

53:44.744 --> 53:45.713
We can afford it.

53:46.715 --> 53:48.817
- Who cares what people think?
- Well, I care.

53:51.818 --> 53:52.954
I'm sorry, Patrick, it...

53:53.954 --> 53:55.390
It just doesn't seem right.

54:03.963 --> 54:06.134
Mama, can we open our candy now?

54:07.168 --> 54:08.836
I'll take it for now and...

54:09.536 --> 54:10.971
you can have it after supper.

54:20.114 --> 54:21.715
Thanks very much.

54:22.715 --> 54:24.152
Oh, hey uh, Patrick...

54:25.485 --> 54:26.621
wanna grab a drink with me?

54:30.623 --> 54:32.593
- Yeah, I'll lead around back.
- Yeah.

54:37.797 --> 54:39.099
Excuse me. Another one, please.

54:42.068 --> 54:43.904
Come on down, girls!

54:44.103 --> 54:45.472
Here they come!

54:48.976 --> 54:51.008
I'm gonna get me
one of them fat ones!

54:51.010 --> 54:52.811
I got mine picked out!

55:12.565 --> 55:14.034
I want her.

55:18.771 --> 55:19.740
- You'll be okay.
- Mama.

55:21.175 --> 55:22.974
All right.
Come here, come here now.

55:22.976 --> 55:24.578
Give me that damn kiss.

55:25.545 --> 55:27.748
- Let's go.
- Mommy.

55:33.219 --> 55:35.686
And that, you know,
and I've had women,

55:35.688 --> 55:36.857
you know, complain about that.

55:38.759 --> 55:41.762
- I'm just sayin' sometimes...
- Evenin', boys.

55:50.737 --> 55:53.207
How are you, Pat?
Haven't seen ya in a while.

55:54.574 --> 55:55.509
You good?

55:57.244 --> 55:58.480
We are friends, aren't we?

55:59.713 --> 56:00.715
No.

56:01.849 --> 56:03.084
I thought
we were friends.

56:04.117 --> 56:05.152
No, we're not.

56:10.590 --> 56:12.025
Can I offer you a drink,
Mr. Albert?

56:13.661 --> 56:15.762
How's business? Good?

56:16.996 --> 56:19.533
- It's all right.
- Oh, that's good.

56:21.268 --> 56:22.903
How's that pretty little wife
of yours?

56:25.338 --> 56:26.206
You know...

56:27.340 --> 56:30.511
Dumb-Dumb's taken
quite a shine to her.

56:30.744 --> 56:32.012
I think he's in love.

56:33.213 --> 56:35.817
You keep that tongue-less
son-of-a-bitch away from her.

56:37.016 --> 56:38.619
He goes his own way, Pat.

56:39.820 --> 56:41.289
If he comes near her again,

56:41.956 --> 56:43.157
I'll fuckin' kill him.

56:44.858 --> 56:45.927
Sure you will.

56:48.295 --> 56:49.664
You couldn't kill anybody.

56:50.697 --> 56:52.933
When I look in your eyes,
all I see is fear.

56:58.338 --> 56:59.574
You want a whore?

57:00.306 --> 57:01.208
On the house.

57:15.389 --> 57:16.657
Rosie.

57:17.724 --> 57:20.193
This is my friend Patrick.
He's a notorious killer.

57:20.893 --> 57:21.895
You need to fuck more.

57:22.630 --> 57:23.597
Hi, killer.

57:24.797 --> 57:25.832
How are you?

57:26.900 --> 57:28.766
- Fine, Thank you.
- I like you. Come on.

57:28.768 --> 57:30.769
- Come on.
- Go with her, Patrick.

57:30.771 --> 57:33.274
I'm fine!

57:33.773 --> 57:34.942
Fuck!

57:50.757 --> 57:52.593
Emily, I need you to look at me.

57:55.728 --> 57:58.332
So, you admit that you took
his gun and you killed him?

58:05.438 --> 58:07.375
There's a new marshal
up at Fort Leavenworth.

58:08.041 --> 58:09.210
I'm gonna send for him.

58:10.677 --> 58:13.280
And if he comes,
there's gonna be a trial.

58:15.014 --> 58:17.150
And more than likely,
you're gonna be found guilty.

58:18.918 --> 58:21.686
- You'll be hanged.
- More business for you, Pat.

58:21.688 --> 58:23.391
I'm sorry,
Mrs. Crabtree, that's the law.

58:49.282 --> 58:51.085
Please, Reverend.

58:51.418 --> 58:53.021
I'll talk to him.

59:02.463 --> 59:04.865
Are they really gonna hang
that little girl?

59:05.965 --> 59:08.101
The reverend said you're going
to build the gallows.

59:08.367 --> 59:09.836
- Is that true?
- Well,

59:10.170 --> 59:11.769
if she's found guilty,
then, yeah.

59:11.771 --> 59:13.074
I'm the town carpenter.
It's my job.

59:28.454 --> 59:29.790
Please don't do it.

59:31.525 --> 59:32.425
It might not happen.

59:33.126 --> 59:35.395
- Maybe, she'll go free.
- But if she doesn't.

59:36.195 --> 59:37.264
Don't do it.

59:38.331 --> 59:39.333
I have to.

59:40.300 --> 59:42.336
The sheriff asked me to.
I already said yes.

59:43.402 --> 59:44.337
Please.

59:45.204 --> 59:46.740
You'll be responsible
for her death.

59:48.474 --> 59:50.310
If the law says
she has to be hanged

59:50.543 --> 59:52.446
then someone has to build
the gallows.

59:55.114 --> 59:57.516
Is it true,
that you were drinking

59:57.518 --> 01:00:00.288
with Dutch Albert
when it happened? With women?

01:00:00.788 --> 01:00:03.088
- It wasn't like that.
- The whole town is saying

01:00:03.090 --> 01:00:04.392
that you and him are friends.

01:00:05.125 --> 01:00:06.791
Don't you care what people say?

01:00:06.793 --> 01:00:09.026
No. All I care about
is you and the children.

01:00:09.028 --> 01:00:12.229
No, no you don't!
You don't care about us!

01:00:12.231 --> 01:00:13.835
Stop it, Audrey! That's enough!

01:00:18.038 --> 01:00:20.074
You never used to speak to me
like that.

01:00:20.574 --> 01:00:21.776
You've changed.

01:00:23.543 --> 01:00:26.379
It took us so long
to be accepted into this town.

01:00:26.980 --> 01:00:28.215
What was all that for?

01:00:28.882 --> 01:00:30.882
Why did we bother
joining the church

01:00:30.884 --> 01:00:32.983
if you were just gonna
throw it all away?

01:00:32.985 --> 01:00:34.955
I joined
because you asked me to join.

01:00:35.521 --> 01:00:38.226
I joined because they gave me
no choice!

01:00:38.525 --> 01:00:40.525
You think those people
care about us, Audrey?

01:00:40.527 --> 01:00:42.193
It's every man
for himself out here!

01:00:42.195 --> 01:00:44.331
Don't you understand that
by now?

01:00:44.565 --> 01:00:47.566
Did they lift a finger to help
Mrs. Crabtree and her children?

01:00:47.568 --> 01:00:50.367
No! They were left to rot
and starve.

01:00:50.369 --> 01:00:52.938
If you wanna blame someone
for Emily Crabtree bein' hanged

01:00:52.940 --> 01:00:56.844
then blame them, the good,
Christian people of this town.

01:00:57.610 --> 01:00:59.279
We're on our own out here,
Audrey.

01:00:59.847 --> 01:01:02.150
Face it. Everyone is.

01:01:03.483 --> 01:01:05.186
And what about Ed and Elsa?

01:01:05.885 --> 01:01:07.154
They care about us.

01:01:07.554 --> 01:01:10.490
They're there for us!
They always have been!

01:01:10.990 --> 01:01:13.161
You're just using that
as an excuse.

01:01:14.228 --> 01:01:17.097
Please.
Please, let's leave here.

01:01:17.463 --> 01:01:19.333
Let's leave here
before it's too late.

01:01:19.532 --> 01:01:21.434
Before it changes you for good.

01:01:24.438 --> 01:01:27.340
We're not leavin'.
The time just isn't right.

01:01:28.641 --> 01:01:30.844
There's still opportunities
for us here.

01:01:31.545 --> 01:01:33.181
You're not even listening to me.

01:03:01.001 --> 01:03:02.003
That's it.

01:03:14.146 --> 01:03:17.284
I need some water!

01:03:20.487 --> 01:03:21.622
Let her sleep.

01:03:22.588 --> 01:03:24.057
Come on, you gotta get up.

01:03:31.364 --> 01:03:32.299
Mommy.

01:03:36.603 --> 01:03:38.769
- Emily!
- Mommy! Help me.

01:03:38.771 --> 01:03:40.040
Emily!

01:03:40.440 --> 01:03:42.440
- No! No!
- No!

01:03:42.442 --> 01:03:44.545
Let her go! Please!

01:03:46.012 --> 01:03:47.778
- Emily!
- Mommy!

01:03:47.780 --> 01:03:49.317
Leave her go!

01:03:52.619 --> 01:03:57.054
<i>♪ He brings
My wandering spirit back ♪</i>

01:03:57.056 --> 01:04:01.962
<i>♪ When I forsake his ways ♪</i>

01:04:03.797 --> 01:04:05.266
This is a sin!

01:04:05.699 --> 01:04:07.702
You're killing
an innocent child!

01:04:08.434 --> 01:04:11.172
Whilst there are real murderers
in our midst!

01:04:12.405 --> 01:04:14.474
It's them you should be hanging!

01:04:14.740 --> 01:04:15.807
Mommy!

01:04:15.809 --> 01:04:17.342
Let her go! Please!

01:04:17.344 --> 01:04:18.709
We are with you, child!

01:04:18.711 --> 01:04:21.614
- Trust in the Lord!
- Mommy!

01:04:23.182 --> 01:04:24.385
Trust in God!

01:04:52.344 --> 01:04:54.381
No!

01:05:50.237 --> 01:05:51.338
Can I see her?

01:06:05.284 --> 01:06:06.686
Take the rope from her neck.

01:06:07.320 --> 01:06:08.322
I beg you.

01:06:27.706 --> 01:06:28.842
My darling.

01:06:39.318 --> 01:06:40.454
I'm so sorry.

01:07:32.706 --> 01:07:34.307
Hello, you two.

01:07:34.541 --> 01:07:36.541
- Where were you?
- Where were you?

01:07:37.811 --> 01:07:38.812
I was in town.

01:07:40.380 --> 01:07:42.249
You've been nice
to your auntie?

01:07:42.748 --> 01:07:44.217
Go and say goodbye.

01:07:44.717 --> 01:07:46.653
- Yes, Mama.
- Yes, Mama.

01:07:54.460 --> 01:07:55.663
I did it myself.

01:07:59.565 --> 01:08:01.334
Look what I can do, Mama.

01:08:05.739 --> 01:08:07.273
That's nice, honey.

01:08:08.307 --> 01:08:09.576
Thank you, Mama.

01:08:11.911 --> 01:08:13.681
Have you been crying, Mama?

01:08:14.014 --> 01:08:17.014
Yeah, I was. But I'm fine now.

01:08:17.015 --> 01:08:18.750
Why? Why were you crying?

01:08:18.752 --> 01:08:20.421
Come on, Emma.
Don't go prying.

01:08:24.055 --> 01:08:25.559
Come on. Up.

01:08:27.827 --> 01:08:31.696
And then you can help me
pick out vegetables for dinner.

01:08:31.698 --> 01:08:32.832
I'll get started.

01:08:41.474 --> 01:08:43.010
Thomas, come on.

01:08:54.988 --> 01:08:57.020
Mama, is this one a flower?

01:08:57.023 --> 01:08:57.925
Yes.

01:08:58.725 --> 01:08:59.827
Can I pick this one, Mama?

01:09:00.527 --> 01:09:01.895
Mama, look at this one.

01:09:04.331 --> 01:09:05.765
Mama, can I eat this one?

01:09:06.032 --> 01:09:07.835
No, this one
is not a flower, Emma.

01:09:15.809 --> 01:09:17.711
Was it Papa?

01:09:19.944 --> 01:09:21.511
No, it wasn't Papa.

01:09:21.514 --> 01:09:23.481
Obviously, it was Grandma.

01:09:23.483 --> 01:09:26.487
Thomas, look what I see.
Let's try and catch it. Come on.

01:09:26.685 --> 01:09:30.787
- I'm coming.
- Faster! Come on, Thomas!

01:10:07.761 --> 01:10:09.563
Some carrots, too?

01:10:09.929 --> 01:10:11.629
There's one more.
There's more...

01:10:11.631 --> 01:10:13.033
You don't have to do anything.

01:10:13.565 --> 01:10:14.867
Look at this.

01:10:15.435 --> 01:10:16.403
Okay.

01:10:20.140 --> 01:10:21.508
Thomas!

01:10:35.755 --> 01:10:37.391
- Pa?
- It's fine!

01:10:37.791 --> 01:10:40.127
Go back inside, son.
Go back inside!

01:11:11.490 --> 01:11:13.894
This innocent girl's life.

01:11:15.728 --> 01:11:16.797
Jesus...

01:11:17.596 --> 01:11:18.564
says that...

01:11:22.868 --> 01:11:24.003
Jesus says that...

01:11:24.770 --> 01:11:26.870
Take your hands off him!

01:11:26.872 --> 01:11:28.040
We don't need your help!

01:11:31.109 --> 01:11:32.145
You...

01:11:33.246 --> 01:11:35.516
have chosen your friends.

01:11:36.882 --> 01:11:39.717
You've had
your 30 pieces of silver.

01:11:39.719 --> 01:11:41.688
Go away. Leave us be.

01:12:08.680 --> 01:12:09.649
What are you doin'?

01:12:10.550 --> 01:12:11.985
I'm leaving tomorrow
with the children.

01:12:12.719 --> 01:12:13.820
With or without you.

01:12:15.287 --> 01:12:17.490
- Audrey.
- I don't care what you say.

01:12:18.625 --> 01:12:19.993
I came to this country
on my own.

01:12:20.560 --> 01:12:22.095
I've been alone most of my life.

01:12:22.962 --> 01:12:24.661
- I don't need you.
- Audrey.

01:12:24.663 --> 01:12:26.532
I'm gonna sell
my mother's broach,

01:12:26.932 --> 01:12:28.702
buy supplies,
and head back east.

01:12:29.269 --> 01:12:30.904
I'm taking the rifle, too.

01:12:31.203 --> 01:12:32.972
You can buy another one
if you're staying.

01:12:33.907 --> 01:12:34.975
Audrey...

01:12:36.175 --> 01:12:37.543
I wanna leave, too.

01:12:39.145 --> 01:12:40.147
All right?

01:12:41.747 --> 01:12:43.149
I'll put an ad up in town
tomorrow...

01:12:44.016 --> 01:12:45.152
sayin' we're sellin' up.

01:12:46.819 --> 01:12:48.121
We'll leave as soon as we can.

01:12:49.122 --> 01:12:50.057
I swear.

01:12:57.963 --> 01:12:59.533
And if we don't sell quick,

01:12:59.731 --> 01:13:01.268
we'll just abandon
the place, okay?

01:13:04.737 --> 01:13:05.639
I just...

01:13:06.506 --> 01:13:07.908
I need to get some sleep.
I need...

01:13:08.975 --> 01:13:10.043
to lie down for a while.

01:13:12.278 --> 01:13:13.280
All right?

01:13:22.988 --> 01:13:25.024
I think I felt
the baby kick today.

01:13:27.793 --> 01:13:29.630
When that poor girl was hung.

01:13:31.797 --> 01:13:33.766
When she fell
through the trapdoor...

01:13:36.234 --> 01:13:38.037
the baby gave a long,
mighty kick.

01:13:40.640 --> 01:13:41.875
It still hurts.

01:13:44.042 --> 01:13:45.045
Still sore.

01:13:47.913 --> 01:13:49.916
I'm sorry, Audrey.

01:13:55.688 --> 01:13:56.890
I love you.

01:13:58.323 --> 01:13:59.893
I love you so much.

01:14:02.228 --> 01:14:03.230
I love you...

01:14:04.329 --> 01:14:05.966
and Emma and Thomas...

01:14:06.899 --> 01:14:09.136
more than anything else
in the whole world.

01:14:10.837 --> 01:14:11.972
You know that, right?

01:14:14.106 --> 01:14:15.175
Huh?

01:14:24.817 --> 01:14:25.918
<i>Mommy!</i>

01:14:30.055 --> 01:14:33.359
<i>Trust in the Lord!</i>

01:14:34.961 --> 01:14:37.664
<i>Mommy!</i>

01:14:59.918 --> 01:15:02.622
Samuel, where are you going?

01:15:03.322 --> 01:15:04.925
Go back to sleep, dear.

01:16:46.359 --> 01:16:47.360
Samuel.

01:16:51.396 --> 01:16:54.867
Samuel! Oh, God. Samuel!

01:16:57.435 --> 01:16:59.072
Samuel!

01:17:00.105 --> 01:17:02.876
Samuel, what have you done?
Samuel?

01:17:03.309 --> 01:17:05.045
- Samuel, what have you...
- They were sinners.

01:17:05.444 --> 01:17:07.114
They were sinners.

01:17:08.113 --> 01:17:10.483
No! No.

01:17:11.283 --> 01:17:13.452
Reverend, come on.
Come on, let's get out.

01:17:18.990 --> 01:17:20.060
Move out of the way, ma'am.

01:17:20.426 --> 01:17:22.162
No! No!

01:17:37.076 --> 01:17:38.078
Please.

01:17:40.279 --> 01:17:41.515
You just killed an unarmed man.

01:17:43.315 --> 01:17:44.317
In cold blood.

01:17:47.987 --> 01:17:49.155
You're gonna hang for this.

01:18:35.467 --> 01:18:36.502
What is it?

01:19:27.686 --> 01:19:28.587
Saint, Patrick.

01:19:36.996 --> 01:19:37.963
Go ahead, pick it up.

01:19:42.033 --> 01:19:43.369
What're ya gonna do, Irish?

01:19:45.371 --> 01:19:46.472
You the law now?

01:19:48.341 --> 01:19:49.910
You don't got the stomach
for it.

01:19:51.543 --> 01:19:53.947
I look in your eyes,
all I see is fear.

01:19:54.313 --> 01:19:55.515
I told ya, Irish.

01:19:58.583 --> 01:20:00.287
Well, I'll give you a free shot.

01:20:01.354 --> 01:20:02.255
Uh...

01:20:03.122 --> 01:20:05.392
If he shoots me,
you let him go, yeah?

01:20:06.125 --> 01:20:07.027
Come on!

01:20:09.462 --> 01:20:10.430
Come on, Irish!

01:20:11.262 --> 01:20:12.298
Go ahead and do it!

01:20:26.444 --> 01:20:27.413
Good boy.

01:20:32.518 --> 01:20:33.653
That what you want?

01:20:37.055 --> 01:20:38.257
Bury 'im up good.

01:20:40.792 --> 01:20:42.094
We ain't friends no more.

01:20:43.729 --> 01:20:45.265
We're enemies now.

01:20:46.465 --> 01:20:47.434
You understand that?

01:21:29.375 --> 01:21:31.310
<i>The reverend
and Sheriff Parker are dead.</i>

01:21:32.444 --> 01:21:34.581
We're leavin' straight
after the funerals tomorrow.

01:21:35.213 --> 01:21:37.016
Let's just take what we can
and get outta here.

01:21:37.750 --> 01:21:39.386
- All right?
- All right.

01:21:55.768 --> 01:21:57.069
I have to go.

01:22:11.350 --> 01:22:12.485
Just put it here.

01:22:30.435 --> 01:22:34.706

01:22:35.573 --> 01:22:40.245

01:22:45.283 --> 01:22:48.320
Oh, where do you want it now?
On your hand.

01:22:48.887 --> 01:22:50.090
Down.

01:23:01.167 --> 01:23:03.403
Yes. Good boy.

01:23:30.261 --> 01:23:31.163
Go inside!

01:23:31.764 --> 01:23:32.899
Go inside now!

01:23:34.899 --> 01:23:36.268
Why?

01:23:48.213 --> 01:23:49.548
Go to your room
and lock the door.

01:23:49.782 --> 01:23:51.915
But why do we have to go
to our room, Mama?

01:23:53.685 --> 01:23:54.653
I'm staying.

01:23:55.654 --> 01:23:56.588
You have to look after
your sister, all right?

01:23:57.555 --> 01:23:59.488
You go to your room,
you go out the window,

01:23:59.490 --> 01:24:01.592
you go get some help.
Get your father. Get the others.

01:24:01.594 --> 01:24:03.893
You understand what I say?
You go! Go!

01:24:05.765 --> 01:24:07.634
I'm gonna hold him off
as long as I can.

01:25:03.521 --> 01:25:04.457
No!

01:25:05.323 --> 01:25:07.893
Now!

01:25:09.694 --> 01:25:11.496
- No! No!
- What about Mama?

01:25:40.993 --> 01:25:41.961
Faster!

01:25:53.005 --> 01:25:55.375
Now, get out of my home!

01:26:05.684 --> 01:26:07.920
Mama! He's hurting Mama!
Sicily's hurting Mama!

01:26:08.119 --> 01:26:09.021
Come on!

01:26:16.862 --> 01:26:19.696
She's still alive,
but don't bring them in there.

01:26:19.698 --> 01:26:20.667
- Go!
- Stay with Ed!

01:26:21.065 --> 01:26:22.601
Where's Papa going?

01:26:27.605 --> 01:26:28.507
Audrey.

01:26:28.873 --> 01:26:30.842
Oh, God. Oh, God.

01:26:40.786 --> 01:26:41.788
Honey.

01:26:43.889 --> 01:26:44.957
My love.

01:26:46.158 --> 01:26:49.329
- Are my babies all right?
- Yeah.

01:27:02.807 --> 01:27:04.476
Take her to your place, Ed.

01:27:06.011 --> 01:27:07.480
Elsa will know what to do.

01:27:14.752 --> 01:27:15.887
If I don't make it back...

01:27:16.954 --> 01:27:19.625
promise me you'll take care
of my family for me.

01:27:21.493 --> 01:27:22.428
Of course.

01:27:40.712 --> 01:27:42.415
<i>I'll be needin' some guns.</i>

01:27:47.485 --> 01:27:50.422
I want a gun that'll kill
the most people in one shot.

01:29:23.047 --> 01:29:25.818
<i>"I saw an angel
standing in the sun...</i>

01:29:27.051 --> 01:29:29.553
and he shouted aloud
to all the birds

01:29:29.555 --> 01:29:31.123
flyin' overhead in the sky.

01:29:32.189 --> 01:29:35.594
Come here, gather at the feast
that God is giving.

01:29:37.162 --> 01:29:39.865
There will be the flesh
of kings for you.

01:29:41.733 --> 01:29:43.732
Of great generals and heroes.

01:29:43.734 --> 01:29:45.737
The flesh of horses
and their riders...

01:29:46.704 --> 01:29:49.742
and of all citizens
great and small."

01:29:55.980 --> 01:29:57.148
Been waitin' for ya, Pat.

01:30:01.219 --> 01:30:02.288
Are you with him, Jim?

01:30:04.221 --> 01:30:06.322
If not, you got two seconds
to get outta here

01:30:06.324 --> 01:30:08.528
you gutless fuckin' bastard.

01:30:08.993 --> 01:30:11.029
He made his decision
a long time ago.

01:30:14.800 --> 01:30:16.769
Maybe I was wrong
about you, Irish.

01:30:17.868 --> 01:30:19.871
I don't see fear
in your eyes anymore.

01:30:22.640 --> 01:30:23.643
Just hate.

01:30:37.322 --> 01:30:40.192
God!

01:31:04.815 --> 01:31:06.184
I was wrong about you, Irish.

01:31:09.320 --> 01:31:10.922
You're American by blood.

01:31:13.891 --> 01:31:14.961
Get on with it.

01:32:14.019 --> 01:32:14.954
Shit.

01:32:19.323 --> 01:32:20.425
Fuck.

01:32:21.993 --> 01:32:22.995
Did you kill him?

01:32:24.395 --> 01:32:25.730
Did you kill him, Pa?

01:32:27.131 --> 01:32:28.166
Yeah.

01:32:29.868 --> 01:32:31.237
What are you still doin' here?

01:32:32.804 --> 01:32:33.905
Are you hurt bad?

01:32:37.408 --> 01:32:38.411
Are you dyin'?

01:32:39.444 --> 01:32:40.680
Yeah.

01:32:42.780 --> 01:32:43.815
I think I am.

01:32:45.917 --> 01:32:48.154
Aunt Elsa says
Mama's gonna be all right.

01:32:50.488 --> 01:32:51.823
That's good, son.

01:32:54.292 --> 01:32:56.729
I'll go get Uncle Ed.
He can help you.

01:32:57.895 --> 01:33:00.032
I don't think so, son.

01:33:00.998 --> 01:33:01.900
But just in case...

01:33:02.768 --> 01:33:03.769
just in case I don't make it...

01:33:04.301 --> 01:33:06.838
I'll get him. You're gonna
be fine, Pa. You'll see.

01:33:07.204 --> 01:33:09.138
And me and you
and Emma and Mama,

01:33:09.140 --> 01:33:11.176
we're all gonna go
to California.

01:33:11.877 --> 01:33:14.246
- We can see the ocean.
- That sounds great.

01:33:17.047 --> 01:33:18.184
But just in case...

01:33:21.051 --> 01:33:23.788
I want you to know how proud
I am of you, son.

01:33:25.524 --> 01:33:28.427
I'm so proud of you.
And your sister, too.

01:33:29.994 --> 01:33:31.063
I love you...

01:33:32.163 --> 01:33:34.966
your mother and your sister
more than life itself.

01:33:37.502 --> 01:33:40.005
And I'm sorry
for all the mistakes I made.

01:33:42.239 --> 01:33:44.443
You can tell your mother
and sister that for me.

01:33:45.443 --> 01:33:47.177
- Can't ya?
- Yes, Pa.

01:33:47.179 --> 01:33:49.481
But you're not gonna die.
You can tell them yourself.

01:33:54.920 --> 01:33:57.389
You're gonna be a hundred times
the man I ever was.

01:33:59.890 --> 01:34:01.860
You're gonna be a great man,
Thomas.

01:34:02.961 --> 01:34:04.530
And you're gonna do
great things.

01:34:07.097 --> 01:34:08.134
Great things.

01:34:12.270 --> 01:34:14.273
Now go on
and get your uncle.
