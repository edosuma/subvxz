00:00.908 --> 00:03.802
Previously on Dance Academy...
You came back.

00:03.882 --> 00:05.862
Not for you. For me.

00:06.938 --> 00:09.922
Those skills are white-hot.
Be gone with your compliments.

00:09.942 --> 00:12.942
You broke up with Tara.
I'm on her side forever.

00:13.502 --> 00:14.570
Excuse me?

00:17.771 --> 00:19.779
I have no idea what just happened.

00:19.799 --> 00:22.843
I was talking to Ethan,
then his tongue was down my throat.

00:23.763 --> 00:26.527
I'll get the scholarship.
You saw me - I'm brilliant.

00:26.547 --> 00:27.819
Deluded.
You really think that?

00:27.839 --> 00:29.827
You've gone backwards
since last year.

01:28.701 --> 01:30.713
The last day of semester,

01:30.729 --> 01:32.697
when holidays are about to start,

01:32.713 --> 01:35.705
the air starts to go kind of... hazy.

01:49.701 --> 01:52.757
It's like we've been holding
our breath for months.

01:55.717 --> 01:57.757
That final exam goes so slowly.

01:59.741 --> 02:03.757
Like we're going to be stuck in that
studio till the end of time.

02:27.729 --> 02:29.705
You can say it, Lucy.

02:33.713 --> 02:35.673
Thank you, students. You're free.

02:35.693 --> 02:38.701
And then it's over,
and we can breathe again.

02:45.749 --> 02:47.701
Mr Lieberman?

02:48.757 --> 02:51.673
Go, go, go!

02:51.693 --> 02:54.713
Can you believe we're going to see
the South Dockers tonight?

02:54.733 --> 02:57.685
I'm calling it best show ever.
First things first.

03:03.737 --> 03:06.717
Maybe we could talk
now that exams are over.

03:06.737 --> 03:10.725
You're really not making that sound
like fun, which is a priority now!

03:10.745 --> 03:16.697
Boys. Tiny brains, cold hearts.
You're joining my girls night.

03:16.717 --> 03:19.725
By the time I'm finished,
you won't remember his name.

03:19.741 --> 03:21.697
I failed all of them?

03:21.717 --> 03:24.669
The official results won't be
released until next week,

03:24.689 --> 03:26.693
but I thought
you should know sooner.

03:26.713 --> 03:29.709
So, I'm guessing the scholarship's
out of the question, then.

03:29.725 --> 03:31.705
As is the Prix de Fonteyn.

03:32.761 --> 03:35.677
Potentially you could
retake your exams,

03:35.697 --> 03:38.737
but that's not even an option
until we sort out your financials.

03:39.753 --> 03:43.757
I can't call my dad.
If I fail, it's like he's won.

03:45.677 --> 03:47.673
Look, it's been a long week.

03:47.693 --> 03:50.737
Get some rest, and we can discuss
your future in the morning.

03:54.685 --> 03:56.693
I think your phone might need
recharging.

03:56.713 --> 03:58.733
I don't take social calls
during exam week.

03:58.753 --> 04:01.709
I guess you won't have much
of a holiday

04:05.757 --> 04:08.741
I've got a few ideas
for a new classical solo.

04:08.761 --> 04:12.673
You wanna work together again?
I've been looking forward to it.

04:12.689 --> 04:13.725
Well, unfortunately,

04:13.745 --> 04:16.141
the dancer-choreographer
relationship is based on trust.

04:16.757 --> 04:20.745
This is about Grace launching herself
at me the other day, isn't it?

04:20.765 --> 04:23.693
She wasn't the one doing
the launching, Ethan.

04:25.689 --> 04:27.733
Someone's playing games here,
Abigail. It's not me.

04:32.737 --> 04:35.673
Alright, talk to me
about the South Dockers.

04:35.693 --> 04:37.705
Uh, Brooklyn's finest
hip-hop dance crew,

04:37.725 --> 04:40.701
formed in 1996
by Deltaroid and Mohani.

04:40.721 --> 04:43.701
No, I meant I cancelled my shift.
I want in!

04:43.721 --> 04:45.749
Dudes night out.
What did Miss Raine want?

04:45.765 --> 04:48.713
I was gonna ask the same about Tara.

04:48.733 --> 04:52.753
When she left that exam, she had
a 'let's talk' look in her eye.

04:53.673 --> 04:55.681
All right, rule number one
for tonight...

04:55.701 --> 04:57.741
talking about females of any kind
is banned.

04:57.761 --> 05:01.721
Yeah, rules! I love it when
a dudes night out gets official.

05:01.737 --> 05:03.709
Hey, well, this is disturbing.

05:03.729 --> 05:07.669
Kat! Ignore everything you've just
heard. You can be our token female.

05:07.689 --> 05:10.749
Very attractive offer, really,
but, no, I have prior engagements.

05:11.669 --> 05:13.693
I just came past
to say happy holidays,

05:13.713 --> 05:16.709
and I'll look forward to seeing
this disaster on Stalkbook.

05:16.729 --> 05:18.741
Bye!
Someone stop her.

05:19.749 --> 05:21.693
Katrina!

05:21.713 --> 05:23.765
Christian, you know where
my priorities lie.

05:24.681 --> 05:25.737
This will be more fun.

05:30.761 --> 05:33.701
Come on, Tara.
Time for some catharsis.

05:35.729 --> 05:39.733
I can't. He looks so wistful.
Shut up and egg his face already.

05:42.677 --> 05:44.753
Who said ballet girls
don't know how to party?

05:45.673 --> 05:47.693
Hi! So, Legal Studies exam -
good or bad?

05:47.713 --> 05:50.729
My agent's just got
a stack of free tickets

05:50.749 --> 05:53.729
to the South Dockers tonight -
under 18s only.

05:53.745 --> 05:55.709
So?

05:55.729 --> 05:57.741
Apparently they're shooting
a film clip

05:57.761 --> 06:01.705
and want a few professional dancers,
ie, moi, plus friends.

06:01.725 --> 06:04.705
Uh, we've got a pretty huge night
planned already, Kat.

06:04.725 --> 06:07.705
Sorry, Grace.
Do you mind if I do this instead?

06:07.725 --> 06:11.689
You'd think she'd want
one night off dancing.

06:12.741 --> 06:16.701
Count us in.
Oh, goody!

06:16.721 --> 06:18.693
Ben, tickets.

06:18.713 --> 06:20.717
I thought you were
buying the tickets.

06:20.733 --> 06:22.729
I put you in charge of organisation.

06:23.733 --> 06:25.741
Let's keep our eye on the prize.

06:25.761 --> 06:29.701
Sammy, we need your good looks,
and, Ben, your powers of persuasion.

06:29.721 --> 06:33.721
Shouldn't it be the other way around?
That was an insult, wasn't it?

06:33.741 --> 06:35.761
Uh, I need to see
your tickets, boys.

06:36.681 --> 06:38.717
Oh, you didn't see us
come out before?

06:38.733 --> 06:41.669
Nope. Got stamps?

06:41.689 --> 06:44.717
Dude, I told you we needed stamps!
Sorry, my bad, mate.

06:44.733 --> 06:47.713
I mean, Deltaroid, he's my cousin.

06:49.709 --> 06:52.709
Mate, here, check this out.
What am I looking at?

06:52.729 --> 06:55.745
Three guys who's gonna make this gig
that much cooler.

06:59.721 --> 07:03.677
This is what happens
when we forget to bring his leash.

07:03.693 --> 07:04.757
When did you get a tatt?

07:05.673 --> 07:07.705
I don't know. A week ago?

07:07.725 --> 07:11.669
I was gonna show Kat, but...
Sorry, no girl talk.

07:11.685 --> 07:12.749
Don't you have to be 18?

07:13.669 --> 07:16.741
Yeah, but people always think
I'm older, the way I move and stuff.

07:16.757 --> 07:18.697
We need a plan B!

07:18.717 --> 07:20.737
We've got 13 hours
before prep class starts.

07:20.757 --> 07:23.717
And your inevitable reconciliation
with Tara.

07:23.737 --> 07:26.749
Rule violation.
We are gonna make the most of it.

07:27.669 --> 07:30.697
I've got an idea.
Let me capture the moment.

07:34.761 --> 07:37.673
Who's that - Ben?
Is he still crushing?

07:37.693 --> 07:39.697
Don't worry,
he'll get bored eventually.

07:40.725 --> 07:45.673
Don't say that. I want someone to be
in love, even if it's not me.

07:45.693 --> 07:48.701
OK, the pathetic
boy talk stops now, OK?

07:48.717 --> 07:50.713
I don't think I can do this.

07:50.733 --> 07:53.745
You can't go wrong with black.
I can't do casual dancing.

07:53.761 --> 07:55.705
Pardon?

07:55.725 --> 07:57.677
She means unstructured,
unchoreographed.

07:57.697 --> 07:59.725
It's a common problem
for the semi-trained.

07:59.745 --> 08:02.673
Maybe I should just
stay home and mope.

08:02.693 --> 08:05.753
Oh, don't listen to her!
I'll show you casual dancing.

08:13.677 --> 08:14.753
How old are you guys?
18.

08:15.673 --> 08:16.717
20.
We're from uni.

08:16.733 --> 08:18.733
Do you know what you're after?

08:18.753 --> 08:22.713
He wants a dolphin
jumping through a rainbow.

08:22.729 --> 08:25.713
We'd like to see a few more options.

08:25.733 --> 08:29.713
Sure. There's a couple of clients
having some work done out the back.

08:29.733 --> 08:32.760
If you wanna hang around,
have a squiz at the books.

08:39.688 --> 08:42.681
And this is plan B?
What can I say?

08:42.701 --> 08:44.721
You're an inspiration.

08:47.681 --> 08:50.697
Hey, every time my dad
sees someone with a tattoo,

08:50.717 --> 08:52.737
he's like,
'Oh, check out that cretin.'

08:55.741 --> 08:57.717
It makes me want one more.

08:57.733 --> 08:59.753
Well, I can't let you fly solo.

09:02.749 --> 09:05.685
Yeah, and I've already got one
obviously.

09:05.705 --> 09:08.685
Miss Raine might ban me from the
Prix de Fonteyn.

09:08.705 --> 09:11.673
That's a good thing?
It saves me from quitting.

09:13.389 --> 09:15.725
Oh, Christian would be
so embarrassed watching this!

09:15.745 --> 09:20.685
He always has to be cool. Like, he's
too cool to talk about what happened.

09:20.705 --> 09:23.745
He tells me he loves me
and then he pushes me away.

09:23.761 --> 09:25.729
It was really unfair.

09:25.745 --> 09:27.741
Eventually he'll come crawling back,

09:27.761 --> 09:31.717
and I'll be like,
'Sorry! You missed your chance, pal!'

09:31.733 --> 09:33.733
OK, less lips, more hips.

09:33.753 --> 09:37.685
Is it just me,
or is Kat really overbearing?

09:37.705 --> 09:41.681
And a useless tutor.
Kat, get out of the way.

09:41.701 --> 09:43.765
Wow! Welcome to the party,
Armstrong.

09:44.681 --> 09:45.729
Whoo!

09:47.717 --> 09:48.761
Remember this one?

10:11.737 --> 10:13.697
Who's that?

10:13.713 --> 10:15.669
Uh, just Tara.

10:17.709 --> 10:19.161
You gonna message her back?

10:19.677 --> 10:21.701
Did you pick one out for us yet?

10:23.749 --> 10:25.745
So, you're seriously
quitting the Prix.

10:25.765 --> 10:29.677
Well, if it's a choice
between some stupid competition

10:29.693 --> 10:31.165
and surfing for two weeks...

10:31.685 --> 10:34.249
Some people are pretty psyched about
that stupid competition.

10:34.669 --> 10:37.669
First you're on my case about Tara,
now the Prix.

10:37.689 --> 10:40.669
You should be thanking me for
bailing. One less competitor.

10:40.685 --> 10:42.753
Wow, thanks so much!

10:43.673 --> 10:45.733
Relax! The worst is over.

10:48.693 --> 10:50.697
So, what's the verdict?

11:12.729 --> 11:16.717
Sweet pea, for this, I want to get
the richest blacks I can,

11:16.733 --> 11:18.733
so I need to go in deep.

11:18.753 --> 11:21.765
And when I say 'deep',
we're talking to the bone here.

11:22.685 --> 11:25.705
To the marrow. You want it
to look good, don't you?

11:26.753 --> 11:28.737
As it's there for life, yes!

11:28.757 --> 11:31.685
I'm not sure about this!

11:31.701 --> 11:33.681
It's called symbolic rebellion, Ben.

11:34.697 --> 11:36.673
Oh, sweet mother, don't...
Shut up!

11:36.693 --> 11:39.717
Just look at this!
You're here under false pretences.

11:39.737 --> 11:41.733
What?
Doesn't change anything.

11:41.753 --> 11:45.685
If you're trying to prove a point,
there are better ways.

11:45.705 --> 11:47.765
You're suggesting I bail?
What is with you tonight?

11:48.685 --> 11:51.725
I don't expect you
to understand, OK? Go.

11:53.729 --> 11:55.705
He's 16, by the way.
Oh!

11:56.741 --> 11:58.717
What is your problem?
Hey! Hey!

11:58.737 --> 12:00.757
Hit me!
Go home to your mummies, boys.

12:01.677 --> 12:02.753
Fight back!
Get off!

12:03.673 --> 12:05.709
If you break anything,
I'll call the cops!

12:07.669 --> 12:11.709
I worked so much harder for you,
and they still let you pass!

12:11.729 --> 12:14.721
We should go.
Why not give me a scholarship too?

12:14.741 --> 12:16.761
Sammy, come on, mate!
Oh!

12:19.677 --> 12:22.257
OK, ladies, I'm the official
bag lady and phone guardian.

12:22.673 --> 12:23.717
Give 'em up.

12:26.681 --> 12:28.685
G'day, girls. Tickets, please.

12:28.705 --> 12:31.693
Uh, we're with the Anne Black Agency.
Four.

12:35.753 --> 12:37.725
Have a good evening.

12:39.673 --> 12:41.681
Hey, girls,
smile for the camera.

12:41.701 --> 12:45.721
Hi, Mum.
Oh, um, hips and hair. OK, let's go.

12:48.709 --> 12:51.689
- All of them?
- Total fail.

12:54.733 --> 12:58.681
If I can't get Dad to start writing
cheques soon, then...

13:00.745 --> 13:03.741
this might be my last night
as an academy student.

13:06.681 --> 13:08.757
Oh, and sorry about hassling you
before about Tara.

13:09.677 --> 13:11.693
I care about her.
So do I.

13:11.713 --> 13:14.753
I think I've been trying
to get her out of my system.

13:15.673 --> 13:18.713
It'd be easier, but maybe I can't.

13:21.753 --> 13:25.765
The girls can get us
into the South Dockers.

13:26.685 --> 13:29.677
They're at the gig?
How did that happen?

13:29.697 --> 13:33.673
Kat as well? Is my eye really
swelled up? Does it look tough?

13:33.689 --> 13:34.729
No.

13:47.685 --> 13:49.721
- Mate, this place is packed.
- Yeah.

13:53.753 --> 13:55.741
OK? Hey!
Hey.

13:57.729 --> 13:59.725
Sammy! What are you doing here?

13:59.741 --> 14:02.761
Hey, players. Welcome to my party.

14:04.757 --> 14:06.717
Ben, put me down!

14:07.753 --> 14:10.705
Hey.
Hey.

15:06.673 --> 15:07.729
That's better.

15:08.733 --> 15:13.761
OK, um, this week has been
pretty ordinary.

15:15.753 --> 15:19.685
And I've been thinking
maybe it's time we unpaused.

15:20.729 --> 15:22.761
Excuse me?
We should probably try again.

15:24.733 --> 15:26.685
Did you just say 'unpaused'?

15:26.701 --> 15:29.689
Yeah, uh, sorry. Bad joke.

15:29.705 --> 15:31.685
It wasn't a pause.

15:31.705 --> 15:34.745
You broke up with me without
giving me a chance to explain.

15:36.741 --> 15:39.709
Do you have any idea
how much that hurt?

15:39.725 --> 15:41.713
Every time we do this...

15:41.733 --> 15:43.753
I should've known you would've made
this difficult.

15:47.701 --> 15:50.733
I'm sorry, Christian,
for not making it easy for you.

15:57.745 --> 15:59.701
Refreshment assistance?

16:00.753 --> 16:03.713
No, I'm going.
You OK?

16:03.733 --> 16:07.721
I'll talk to you in the morning
about it. OK.

16:08.725 --> 16:11.733
You know, I'd give you
my scholarship if I could.

16:21.721 --> 16:23.737
What changed?
What?

16:23.757 --> 16:27.669
After the flash mob,
I thought you liked me back.

16:27.689 --> 16:29.709
I'm not picking up
that vibe anymore.

16:29.725 --> 16:31.713
There's somebody else...

16:31.733 --> 16:34.261
one of those inappropriate,
unattainable situations.

16:34.681 --> 16:36.721
Sorry!
No, it's fine.

16:36.741 --> 16:39.677
Great, actually.
It's usually because I'm annoying.

16:47.693 --> 16:49.749
Here, guys.
Oh, yes, please.

16:49.765 --> 16:51.701
Thanks, Sammy.

17:05.757 --> 17:08.749
They're amazing! Thanks for putting
us on the door.

17:08.765 --> 17:11.669
I thought you guys bought tickets.

17:11.689 --> 17:14.693
You texted Christian about it.
It wasn't me.

17:14.713 --> 17:18.676
It was Kat.
Uh, excuse me?

17:18.696 --> 17:20.693
You've been texting Christian
all night.

17:20.713 --> 17:22.724
How would you know?
Thank you, Abigail.

17:22.744 --> 17:24.744
Sorry, what?
Want to check her phone?

17:24.761 --> 17:27.729
Why have you been texting Christian?

17:44.697 --> 17:47.717
T...
Don't explain.

17:47.737 --> 17:50.677
You guys are allowed to talk.
You're friends.

17:50.693 --> 17:52.685
Yeah, we are.

17:54.749 --> 17:58.705
So, when he tells you that
the break-up was all my fault,

17:58.721 --> 17:59.761
what do you say?

18:00.681 --> 18:04.713
I don't talk about that stuff
with him, Tara. I wouldn't!

18:06.725 --> 18:08.673
But truth time?

18:08.693 --> 18:11.717
I don't think you should have tried
to contact his dad.

18:11.733 --> 18:14.689
He wants to meet him. I know he does.

18:14.709 --> 18:17.677
Maybe, but that's just
another way of saying,

18:17.693 --> 18:19.361
'There's something wrong with you.'

18:20.677 --> 18:22.357
There IS something wrong with him.

18:22.677 --> 18:24.705
There's something wrong
with all of us, T.

18:25.737 --> 18:29.749
I shouldn't have come out tonight.
You know what? I don't feel great.

18:30.669 --> 18:33.761
I'm gonna go home, but you should
stay here with the other guys.

18:47.741 --> 18:50.709
It's so terrible
when you can't trust your friends.

18:50.729 --> 18:53.697
I trust her.
I trust her more than anyone.

20:27.697 --> 20:29.669
Hey.

20:30.765 --> 20:32.709
That's weird.

20:32.729 --> 20:36.721
I was just messaging you telling you
not to message me anymore.

20:36.737 --> 20:38.693
What happened?

20:39.721 --> 20:41.765
There were some highs,
there were some lows.

20:42.681 --> 20:44.673
It was character building.

20:47.705 --> 20:49.721
I wish you came with us tonight.

20:49.737 --> 20:53.677
You're so... easy.

20:54.717 --> 20:57.693
Wow! Just what a lady wants to hear.

20:57.709 --> 20:59.741
No, that's not what I mean.

20:59.761 --> 21:03.765
I mean, everything's a lot easier
when you're around.

21:09.765 --> 21:12.733
Well, I totally agree.
Things should be easy.

21:12.749 --> 21:14.697
Like sliced cheese.

21:14.717 --> 21:17.729
Whoever thought that a big block of
cheese would be easy.

21:17.749 --> 21:20.701
You can't grab the cheese
and just bite it...

21:24.725 --> 21:26.669
Oh, OK, sorry!

21:27.693 --> 21:29.753
It wasn't your fault.
Sort of was.

21:32.697 --> 21:33.741
Bye.

21:41.749 --> 21:43.693
Last night was fun!

21:43.713 --> 21:46.693
Yeah. You did a good job
getting rid of Kat.

21:46.713 --> 21:48.757
She deserved it.
She lied to Tara's face.

21:49.673 --> 21:51.669
So, it was all for Tara.

21:51.689 --> 21:55.697
It seemed like you wanted to get Kat
the moment she hijacked your night.

21:55.717 --> 21:59.697
Judgment, Abs. Really!
You've done a lot worse.

21:59.717 --> 22:02.713
Only to get ahead at the academy,
not for fun.

22:05.701 --> 22:07.669
Ethan.

22:07.689 --> 22:10.673
I have five seconds before Prix
class and one question.

22:11.705 --> 22:15.737
If you choreography my solo,
do I still get co-credit? Nope.

22:25.737 --> 22:28.709
Any thoughts overnight?

22:28.725 --> 22:30.753
I'm gonna call my dad,

22:31.673 --> 22:35.709
but whatever he says,
I'm not ready to give up yet.

22:44.685 --> 22:45.729
During exams,

22:45.749 --> 22:48.701
I can't wait to get away
from the academy,

22:48.721 --> 22:51.761
but it's only when I'm back
that the world makes sense again.

22:52.681 --> 22:54.741
So, I've talked to Kat.
Right.

22:56.681 --> 22:59.709
And she said that she thought
that I went way overboard

22:59.725 --> 23:01.689
trying to track down your dad.

23:02.693 --> 23:05.669
And she was right.
So were you.

23:05.689 --> 23:08.761
After everything we went through, it
was unfair to end things like that.

23:11.705 --> 23:13.685
So, what do we do now?

23:16.681 --> 23:18.749
I thought I needed
a break from this place.

23:21.713 --> 23:25.761
I think I need a break from us.
A break-up.

23:26.677 --> 23:27.761
I'm sorry.

23:34.689 --> 23:38.753
OK, two weeks until preliminaries,
gang. Let's make them count.

23:42.713 --> 23:45.689
I hold my breath when I'm here,

23:45.705 --> 23:47.709
and I can't breathe when I'm not.

23:48.753 --> 23:53.677
But at least when I'm dancing,
I know what to work on.

23:53.693 --> 23:55.157
There's a way to fix things.
