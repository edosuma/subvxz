the government will do

The truth is we have
no idea what might happen.

This time, woke up on a rooftop.

10:50.651 --> 10:51.944
Same thing.

10:53.445 --> 10:54.363
No idea how I got there

Why?

11:31.817 --> 11:33.611
What is he doing?

You know, you could get someone
else to turn on the spotlight.

11:49.168 --> 11:50.878
I like doing it.

11:51.962 --> 11:53.589
Because it reminds people
that even in darkness,

11:53.756 --> 11:54.757
there is light.

11:55.925 --> 11:57.426
And it reminds me.

11:59.929 --> 12:01.639
We're low on supplies.

12:02.556 --> 12:05.309
Government won't evac,
won't send in help.

12:06.852 --> 12:08.354
It doesn't make sense.

12:10.814 --> 12:12.066
I imagine, from where they sit,

12:12.233 --> 12:14.652
it's pretty easy to ignore
people's suffering.

12:19.073 --> 12:21.492
I gave Lucius permission to raid
the Wayne Enterprises R & D lab

12:21.659 --> 12:23.244

Why hasn't your boss left his

14:05.137 --> 14:06.722

14:06.889 --> 14:08.182
murdered Butch

14:08.349 --> 14:11.143
so it'll have to be
2,000 rounds.

14:11.310 --> 14:13.228
Barbara, we're not giving
that bastard anything.

14:13.896 --> 14:17.149
Exactly. We're trading
for something we need.

14:17.524 --> 14:18.609
No.

14:20.444 --> 14:23.238
Honey, no one is asking you

14:23.405 --> 14:24.907
to forget what happened,

14:25.324 --> 14:27.993
but how do we protect the women
who come in here every day

14:28.160 --> 14:29.495
looking for safety?

14:30.079 --> 14:31.455
We need this.

14:32.581 --> 14:34.208
Penguin's time will come.

14:34.625 --> 14:35.709
I promise.

14:37.753 --> 14:38.837
(scoffs)

14:48.931 --> 14:51.350
He's gonna regret
giving me this.

14:55.229 --> 14:57.231
Better make it 3,000 rounds.

15:01.318 --> 15:03.487
(indistinct radio chatter)

15:05.823 --> 15:07.366
OFFICER:
Something's out there.

15:08.534 --> 15:12.413
- There. See? The shadow moved.
- (second officer laughs)

15:12.579 --> 15:14.623
It's just a shadow, man.

15:14.790 --> 15:17.418
No. Something's out there.

15:22.297 --> 15:24.007
There. See?

15:25.884 --> 15:26.885
(growls)

15:27.052 --> 15:29.680
(screaming)

15:29.888 --> 15:30.848
Hey, you okay?

15:31.181 --> 15:32.724
(screaming continues)

15:32.891 --> 15:33.892
You Okay?

15:34.393 --> 15:36.311
Would you like me
to make it stop?

15:37.062 --> 15:38.814
(whimpering):
Yes.

15:39.064 --> 15:40.441
Open this door.

15:40.649 --> 15:42.151
(grunting)

15:42.317 --> 15:43.777
No, no, no!
Don't open the gate!

15:43.944 --> 15:46.613
(alarm buzzing)

15:46.989 --> 15:48.532
(groaning)

15:50.659 --> 15:53.370
Split up. Take what we came for.

15:54.621 --> 15:57.249
Kill whoever stands in your way.

15:57.791 --> 16:01.086
Show these fools
the face of fear.

16:01.253 --> 16:02.921
(others shouting)

16:03.380 --> 16:04.798
These here are
the weak points.

16:05.299 --> 16:07.926
Reinforce all barriers
that front Penguin's territory.

16:08.093 --> 16:09.178
I want to be ready.

16:09.636 --> 16:11.597
(electrical buzzing
and whirring)

16:16.602 --> 16:17.686
HARPER:
What the hell?

16:18.145 --> 16:19.730
(quiet, indistinct chatter)

16:25.110 --> 16:26.153
Find Lucius.

16:26.487 --> 16:28.238
Tell him to meet me
at the generator.

16:31.033 --> 16:33.160
(machine beeping)

16:49.760 --> 16:51.053
Lights are out everywhere.

16:51.386 --> 16:52.596
Well, don't you worry,
Master Bruce.

16:52.763 --> 16:54.431
Clinic's got its own
backup generator.

16:54.640 --> 16:57.893
(clanking, electrical buzzing)

16:58.685 --> 16:59.353
You see?

16:59.478 --> 17:01.522
Everything's shipshape
and Bristol fashion.

17:01.897 --> 17:02.689
No.

17:04.023 --> 17:04.983
Something's wrong.

17:05.817 --> 17:07.736
Men in the basement.

17:08.153 --> 17:09.488
They're stealing
all the medicine.

17:10.821 --> 17:11.865
Alfred,
stay with Selina.

17:12.532 --> 17:13.784
Of course, but you
can't go down there.

17:13.951 --> 17:16.203
It's gonna be pitch black.
Gonna need a torch or something.

17:16.787 --> 17:18.329
Lucius gave me
something better.

17:21.583 --> 17:23.126
- Careful.
- (door closes)

17:24.461 --> 17:26.213
(door creaking)

17:29.925 --> 17:30.884
(door closes)

17:31.468 --> 17:34.012
(buzzing, crackling)

17:52.906 --> 17:56.034
(metallic scraping and clanging;
grunting)

17:56.660 --> 17:58.662
I know what
you're thinking, Captain.

17:59.788 --> 18:01.373
I have so few
bullets.

18:01.999 --> 18:03.875
Do I spend one on him?

18:04.293 --> 18:05.502
Is it worth it?

18:06.962 --> 18:08.630
I already know it's not.

18:10.257 --> 18:11.508
My other question is:

18:11.675 --> 18:13.969
Why are you here?
It's not to steal the generator.

18:14.219 --> 18:16.221
Why would I
want light?

18:16.430 --> 18:18.932
Fear lives in darkness.

18:19.933 --> 18:21.977
So what then?
You came for our supplies?

18:22.144 --> 18:23.186
Exactly so.

18:23.395 --> 18:26.148
But since I'm here,
I'll also take your life.

18:26.356 --> 18:29.610
(grunting)

18:38.702 --> 18:41.872
It's been a while since you
tasted my toxin, Captain.

18:42.331 --> 18:43.957
What are you scared of now?

18:44.791 --> 18:45.751
<i>Not you.</i>

18:48.795 --> 18:50.589
(screaming)

18:53.759 --> 18:55.385
(explosive whoosh)

18:59.222 --> 19:00.098
(frantic chatter)

19:00.265 --> 19:01.767
Hey!Hey!

19:01.933 --> 19:04.853
- (gunfire, bullets ricocheting)
- Hey!

19:08.065 --> 19:09.566
They got the beans.

19:10.317 --> 19:12.611
(quiet, indistinct chatter)

19:13.195 --> 19:14.237
Go. The lights are back up.

19:14.404 --> 19:15.489
Go! Move! Go!

19:15.656 --> 19:17.616
(high-pitched whirring)

19:19.534 --> 19:21.953
(gasps)
Did... did you hear that?

19:23.080 --> 19:24.498
(yells)

19:36.885 --> 19:38.345
(grunting)

19:39.930 --> 19:40.972
Hello?

19:43.100 --> 19:44.226
Scag?

19:44.935 --> 19:46.353
Hey".hey,guys?

19:47.312 --> 19:48.397
Scag?

19:50.816 --> 19:53.610
Hey, guys, this isn't...
this isn't funny.

19:58.657 --> 20:00.242
(grunting)

20:00.409 --> 20:01.702
- (high-pitched ringing)
- (screams)

20:01.868 --> 20:03.954
(grunting, gasping)

20:04.121 --> 20:05.831
Go back! Go back!

20:05.997 --> 20:07.749
(panting, frantic chatter)

20:15.465 --> 20:17.509
(tires squealing,
sirens wailing)

20:17.676 --> 20:18.969
(clamoring)

20:19.136 --> 20:21.012
First their government
abandons them,

20:21.388 --> 20:23.140
and then some freak
dressed like a scarecrow

20:23.306 --> 20:24.433
steals their grub.

20:24.683 --> 20:26.017
I'd be pissed, too.

20:26.727 --> 20:27.686
So where are we?

20:28.311 --> 20:29.438
At current consumption,

20:29.604 --> 20:31.189
we've got a week of food.

20:31.690 --> 20:32.774
Go to half rations.

20:32.941 --> 20:34.443
We're already at half rations.

20:35.110 --> 20:36.278
Cut 'em again.

20:36.445 --> 20:37.738
The people won't be happy.

20:37.904 --> 20:39.448
I haven't been happy
in ten years.

20:39.698 --> 20:40.991
At least they'll be alive.

20:41.158 --> 20:43.493
All right, that buys us
two weeks. Then what?

20:44.119 --> 20:44.828
Jim, at this point,

20:44.995 --> 20:46.496
the bastards across the
river are gonna have to

20:46.663 --> 20:48.457
- step up and help.
- Why start now?

20:48.623 --> 20:49.458
They haven't before.

20:49.666 --> 20:51.501
For the love of God, we...
because we stayed

20:51.668 --> 20:53.128
to do the job
they wouldn't.

20:53.420 --> 20:55.422
Huh? And now they're just
gonna sit back and watch

20:55.589 --> 20:57.340
while we starve or
tear ourselves apart?

20:57.507 --> 20:58.425
Because that's
what's gonna happen.

20:58.592 --> 20:59.634
I know, Harv.

20:59.801 --> 21:01.928
But right now, we have to tell
these people something.

21:02.095 --> 21:03.513
BRUCE: Tell them
help is coming.

21:05.474 --> 21:06.725
I'll fly in supplies.

21:08.310 --> 21:09.352
We tried that.

21:09.519 --> 21:11.271
We couldn't even get
permission to take off.

21:11.521 --> 21:12.981
Zero tolerance.
Nothing in or out.

21:13.190 --> 21:14.524
BRUCE: Well, I'm not
asking for permission.

21:15.817 --> 21:16.693
It's ready.

21:17.110 --> 21:18.320
Alfred's already radioed
to have it delivered

21:18.487 --> 21:19.613
from our
east bay hangar.

21:20.155 --> 21:21.990
We can have a supply chopper
here within hours.

21:24.117 --> 21:26.870
Man, it is nice to have
a billionaire around.

21:27.078 --> 21:27.954
Even if it succeeds,

21:28.121 --> 21:29.331
the government's
gonna find out.

21:29.498 --> 21:30.791
It's a one-time solution.

21:31.208 --> 21:33.251
Scarecrow's men
didn't just take food.

21:35.545 --> 21:37.380
They stole medicine
from the clinic.

21:40.217 --> 21:41.843
There are people in pain.

21:47.182 --> 21:49.267
Harvey, tell the people
help is on the way.

21:49.643 --> 21:50.644
You got it.

21:54.898 --> 21:55.857
How's Selina?

21:59.820 --> 22:01.196
She's strong.

22:02.531 --> 22:03.990
She'll pull through.

22:16.503 --> 22:19.089
<i>Doc says the surgery
was a success.</i>

22:20.632 --> 22:23.051
My spine's not gonna
turn to jelly.

22:24.886 --> 22:26.972
Still never be able
to walk again, so...

22:27.389 --> 22:28.765
that's a bummer.

22:31.434 --> 22:33.395
There's limited resources here.

22:34.479 --> 22:36.815
But there's hope
once we join the mainland.

22:37.899 --> 22:38.900
Gee.

22:40.235 --> 22:42.320
For a second there,
I was worried.

22:43.905 --> 22:46.074
Selina, I know you're in pain.

22:47.659 --> 22:49.494
Some medicine is on its way.

22:50.620 --> 22:52.247
You know what's funny?

22:55.333 --> 22:57.711
Jeremiah shot me to get to you.

23:02.257 --> 23:04.301
After all the things
I've done...

23:07.304 --> 23:09.598
...what did me in
was being your friend.

23:15.562 --> 23:17.772
I just wish
Jeremiah killed me.

23:36.416 --> 23:37.792
Doctors can't help her.

23:41.421 --> 23:44.007
She needs the witch.

23:48.303 --> 23:49.930
(indistinct chatter)

23:50.138 --> 23:51.264
MAN:
Thank you.

23:52.682 --> 23:53.892
How's the mood?

23:54.059 --> 23:55.352
They're hanging
in there.

23:56.728 --> 23:58.396
They love their
Jim Gordon.

23:58.980 --> 24:02.233
But if that chopper
doesn't come, it'll be bad.

24:07.989 --> 24:09.157
It'll come.

24:10.784 --> 24:12.744
(operatic music playing)

24:14.245 --> 24:15.246
(groans)

24:22.253 --> 24:23.421
Feels good.

24:25.215 --> 24:26.841
Missing something, though.

24:29.094 --> 24:30.720
Put a knife on it.

24:32.889 --> 24:34.891
- (laughing)
"(door opens)

24:35.058 --> 24:37.560
Another shutdown at the factory.

24:38.103 --> 24:41.398
A worker fell
into a hydraulic press.

24:41.564 --> 24:43.858
It appears
he passed out from hunger.

24:44.359 --> 24:47.195
Sir, I worry if we don't
increase the food allowance...

24:47.362 --> 24:48.113
Mr. Penn,

24:48.279 --> 24:51.074
I feel for all
of our workers.

24:51.533 --> 24:54.577
But I cannot give
what I do not have.

25:00.917 --> 25:02.585
Overcooked!

25:02.961 --> 25:04.212
(dog pants, whines)

25:04.379 --> 25:05.338
(sighs)

25:06.715 --> 25:07.507
Edward.

25:07.674 --> 25:09.300
Flaughs)

25:11.928 --> 25:14.472
Such a good boy.

25:14.639 --> 25:16.433
(laughing)

25:17.684 --> 25:20.311
Quality at the factory
is also suffering.

25:20.687 --> 25:22.939
- More misfires...
- Nonsense.

25:23.106 --> 25:24.315
%9unshon
-(whimpers)

25:25.233 --> 25:26.568
Our rounds
are fine.

25:27.027 --> 25:28.737
And now you've upset Edward.

25:28.903 --> 25:30.321
%pops)
'(9l'0ans)

25:30.739 --> 25:31.948
As you see,

25:32.323 --> 25:33.825
more misfires.

25:33.992 --> 25:36.745
- Sir, if we don't give better quality...
- Shut up.

25:37.370 --> 25:38.329
Sir?

25:40.540 --> 25:42.208
- Sir?
- Shh, shut up!

25:42.417 --> 25:43.251
Shut up.

25:44.419 --> 25:45.545
Do you hear that?

25:46.463 --> 25:47.756
(exhales)

25:48.048 --> 25:51.009
You said yourself, Penguin has
locked himself in City Hall

25:51.176 --> 25:53.011
- with a small army.
- I know that.

25:53.178 --> 25:55.138
- And I know you miss Butch.
- Do you?

25:55.305 --> 25:57.223
Because he only
did it to hurt me.

25:58.641 --> 26:00.268
That's why I have
to make it right.

26:00.435 --> 26:02.812
And how are you gonna do that
and not get killed?

26:05.774 --> 26:07.233
I need you, too.

26:08.109 --> 26:10.403
(helicopter whirring faintly
in distance)

26:10.570 --> 26:12.030
(whirring grows closer)

26:12.822 --> 26:14.407
Tabby, you hear me?

26:15.325 --> 26:16.701
Is that a chopper?

26:26.294 --> 26:27.337
There it is.

26:30.381 --> 26:31.591
This is Bruce Wayne.

26:31.758 --> 26:33.802
I'm at the GCPD.
We can see you.

26:34.761 --> 26:36.429
<i>PILOT</i> (over <i>radio): <i>
Copy that, Mr. Wayne.</i></i>

26:36.596 --> 26:38.306
<i>We'll meet you
at the rendezvous point.</i>

26:49.109 --> 26:50.401
<i>PILOT:
Mayday! Mayday!</i>

26:50.568 --> 26:51.861
<i>We've been hit!
We're going down hard.</i>

26:52.028 --> 26:53.905
- Harvey, the chopper went down.
- PILOT: Mayday! Mayday!

26:54.072 --> 26:55.406
GORDON:
Get a team together now.

26:55.573 --> 26:57.909
<i>PILOT: Brace for impact-
We're going down.</i>

26:58.076 --> 26:59.369
Oh, my God.

27:05.542 --> 27:07.877
Chopper went down
in Lo Boyz territory.

27:08.044 --> 27:10.046
I expect we'll have to fight
our way in and out.

27:10.213 --> 27:11.339
I know it's a lot to ask,

27:11.506 --> 27:13.049
but without those
supplies, we're done.

27:13.216 --> 27:14.968
Can we get some more ammo?
We're running dry down here.

27:15.135 --> 27:16.970
Be happy you got what you got,
and get in.

27:17.137 --> 27:19.097
GORDON: Alfred, I expected
to see Bruce here,

27:19.264 --> 27:21.307
- wanting to come along.
- Well, you'd think, wouldn't you?

27:21.474 --> 27:23.017
I mean, his chopper, his pilots.

27:23.560 --> 27:24.727
Maybe he thought
you wouldn't allow it.

27:24.894 --> 27:26.563
(engines starting)

27:26.729 --> 27:28.773
Just keep an eye on things
while I'm gone.

27:30.191 --> 27:31.526
(sirens whooping)

27:38.533 --> 27:40.910
(whirring, crackling)

28:01.431 --> 28:02.682
Hello.

28:03.975 --> 28:07.145
The Lo Boyz, is it?

28:07.312 --> 28:08.021
(chuckles)

28:08.521 --> 28:10.273
I suspect you know who I am.

28:10.940 --> 28:12.483
This ain't your turf, bird man.

28:12.734 --> 28:14.027
OSWALD:
Be that as it may,

28:14.194 --> 28:16.279
I'm here to claim that.

28:18.781 --> 28:20.033
Like hell.

28:21.451 --> 28:22.619
(sighs)

28:25.788 --> 28:27.290
(men shouting, grunting)

28:29.626 --> 28:31.127
Get it in the truck.

28:32.045 --> 28:33.796

28:39.761 --> 28:40.970
Oswald!

28:41.512 --> 28:42.680
Jim.

28:43.306 --> 28:45.516
I thought you might show up.

28:46.434 --> 28:49.145
It is so good to
see you, old friend.

28:50.021 --> 28:52.607
How are you faring
in these troubled times?

28:53.233 --> 28:55.318
Tell your men to step away
from the chopper.

28:55.526 --> 28:58.529
Sorry. Mouths to feed.

28:59.447 --> 29:01.532
And you know all
about that, don't you?

29:02.158 --> 29:03.243
I hear you are up

29:03.409 --> 29:05.620
to your ears in refugees.

29:05.787 --> 29:08.164
We're protecting children,
families.

29:08.331 --> 29:09.666
We need those supplies.

29:10.250 --> 29:12.126
You shouldn't have
shot it down, Oswald.

29:12.752 --> 29:14.963
You think I did this?
(laughs)

29:15.129 --> 29:16.506
No, no, no, no, no.

29:17.131 --> 29:19.634
That would mean that I knew
a chopper was coming,

29:19.801 --> 29:22.011
which I did not.
I mean, don't get me wrong,

29:22.178 --> 29:23.346
we're still taking everything,

29:23.513 --> 29:25.974
but I did not fire the shot.

29:26.140 --> 29:27.267
It was an RPG.

29:27.433 --> 29:29.143
Who else has that kind
of firepower?

29:30.144 --> 29:31.271
Fair point.

29:32.063 --> 29:33.648
But if it was me,

29:34.274 --> 29:35.775
wouldn't I just admit it?

29:36.567 --> 29:38.152
(laughing):
I mean,

29:38.319 --> 29:40.446
it's not like
I'm going to be arrested.

29:42.323 --> 29:43.616
Then who was it?

29:43.783 --> 29:44.867
No idea.

29:45.159 --> 29:47.245
Now, nice as it was catching up,

29:47.412 --> 29:49.122
it's time you skedaddle.

29:49.539 --> 29:50.957
While you can.

29:52.000 --> 29:54.127
We are, uh, kind of
outgunned here, partner.

29:54.294 --> 29:55.336
OSWALD:
Listen to Harvey.

29:56.254 --> 29:57.880
After all we have been through,

29:58.047 --> 30:00.174
do not make me kill you.

30:01.217 --> 30:02.552
Not like this.

30:08.975 --> 30:11.644

30:22.238 --> 30:24.574
(grunting and groaning)

30:28.578 --> 30:29.954

30:30.121 --> 30:32.290
- You should've stayed home.
- Listen to me.

30:33.374 --> 30:35.460
I know you're upset about Butch.

30:35.626 --> 30:36.669
(grunts)

30:36.836 --> 30:37.837
He thought
you were his friend!

30:38.004 --> 30:39.839
- I was his friend!
- Liar!

30:40.256 --> 30:42.300
You put a knife in
my mother's back.

30:42.467 --> 30:44.927
His blood is on your hands!

30:45.386 --> 30:48.723
You really think that I expected
to come here and walk away?

30:51.809 --> 30:52.810
Jim, are you just
going to let her

30:52.977 --> 30:54.729
kill me like this in cold blood?

30:55.396 --> 30:57.148
Jim, listen to me.
You are not the only one

30:57.315 --> 30:58.441
keeping Gotham from the abyss.

30:58.608 --> 31:00.234
I am! I provide stability!

31:00.401 --> 31:02.695
(gasps, pants)

31:04.781 --> 31:06.407
I may have pulled the trigger,

31:06.991 --> 31:09.160
but you killed Butch.

31:11.954 --> 31:13.664
Shut up and die.

31:14.791 --> 31:17.043

(laughing)

31:25.468 --> 31:26.719
(grunting)

31:27.303 --> 31:29.263
Now, if that was
one of my bullets,

31:29.430 --> 31:32.850
I will certainly be having
a word with my foreman.

31:33.309 --> 31:35.061
Unacceptable!

31:36.479 --> 31:38.898
Say hello to Butch.

31:39.065 --> 31:40.441

Uh-oh, Jim!

32:51.053 --> 32:53.264
Sounding a little quiet
over there!

32:55.683 --> 32:57.185
What the hell do we do now?

33:28.174 --> 33:30.551
I know, I shouldn't
be here. But look.

33:30.843 --> 33:33.179
Penguin had a truck out back.
I took these.

33:33.679 --> 33:34.680
And there's more.

33:34.889 --> 33:36.224
I could kiss you, kid.

OSWALD: For the
record, this is not

33:38.684 --> 33:40.061

33:40.228 --> 33:41.354
You son of a bitch.

33:42.230 --> 33:44.023
I will rip out your heart!

33:44.190 --> 33:46.776
Quiet. Now, that is exactly
the kind of talk

33:46.943 --> 33:48.402
that's gonna force my hand.

33:48.945 --> 33:51.864
But for old time's sake,
I will give you a chance.

33:52.949 --> 33:54.742
Can we move past this?

33:55.660 --> 33:58.955
Say the whole Tabitha-Butch
chapter is over?

34:00.373 --> 34:03.417
I am gonna feed your guts

34:09.422 --> 34:10.716
So, no.

34:13.427 --> 34:15.012
What's the plan, boss?

34:16.597 --> 34:17.764
Cover me.

34:18.516 --> 34:19.809
GORDON:
Oswald!

34:20.351 --> 34:21.726
I want to make a deal.

34:22.436 --> 34:24.522
(chuckling):
A deal, Jim?

34:26.065 --> 34:28.775
We split whatever's
in the chopper 50-50...

34:30.402 --> 34:31.987
...and you let Barbara go.

34:33.114 --> 34:34.072
No.

34:34.699 --> 34:37.326
He does not get to limp
out of here alive!

34:38.327 --> 34:39.579
Shh!

34:41.246 --> 34:42.998
I got a deal for you, Jim.

34:43.416 --> 34:47.628
She dies, I take everything,
and you go home and reflect

34:47.795 --> 34:49.547
long and hard

34:49.714 --> 34:51.299
on my generosity.

34:51.465 --> 34:52.967
And if I say no?

34:53.884 --> 34:55.594
What happens
when the government finds out

34:55.761 --> 34:58.347
you murdered the only cops
left in Gotham?

35:00.182 --> 35:01.642
(laughing):
Nothing.

35:03.102 --> 35:04.437
Jim, as far as
I can tell,

35:04.604 --> 35:07.815
you have nothing to offer,
and you're out of ammo.

35:11.027 --> 35:12.987
(shrieking)

35:14.238 --> 35:15.364
Not anymore.

35:17.867 --> 35:19.410
Truth is, I was never
gonna make that deal.

35:19.577 --> 35:21.662
I need all those supplies.
Load up!

gonna pull through?

35:43.142 --> 35:44.685
Cockroaches are hard to kill.

35:44.852 --> 35:46.437
But at least he'll be
out of commission for a while.

35:46.604 --> 35:47.605
You had him
dead to rights.

35:47.772 --> 35:49.023
You could've put
him down for good.

35:49.190 --> 35:51.150
Yeah, shot a man
without warning.

35:51.317 --> 35:52.943
Three months ago, I would've
lost my badge for that.

35:53.110 --> 35:55.279
Three months ago, we weren't
fighting for our survival.

35:55.446 --> 35:56.906
You think it didn't
cross my mind?

35:57.239 --> 35:58.658
I know what
we're up against, Harvey.

35:59.450 --> 36:00.451
No one is coming to help.

36:00.618 --> 36:01.911
Then why didn't you
do us all a favor

36:02.078 --> 36:04.080
and put that murdering
son of a bitch in a hole?

36:04.872 --> 36:06.832
You want rules for this game?
I'll tell you.

36:06.999 --> 36:09.168
I'll make it simple, okay?
You win or you die.

been taken to the clinic.

41:57.433 --> 41:58.600
<i>MAN:
Captain Gordon!</i>

41:58.809 --> 41:59.977
Captain Gordon!

42:02.354 --> 42:03.564
What's going on?

42:04.690 --> 42:05.691
MAN:
I was on duty

42:05.774 --> 42:06.900
at the Thompson
Street barricade.

42:07.067 --> 42:08.861
(panting):
He just appeared.

42:09.028 --> 42:10.696
He said he needed to see you.

42:11.196 --> 42:12.364
What happened, son?

42:12.906 --> 42:14.033
Where'd you come from?

42:15.701 --> 42:17.036
(whispers):
Past the train station.

42:17.536 --> 42:18.579
BULLOCK: That's on
the other side of town.

42:18.746 --> 42:19.747
This kid must've
made it through

42:19.913 --> 42:21.623
half a dozen sectors
to get here.

42:22.082 --> 42:23.751
My brothers and sisters.

42:25.252 --> 42:26.295
They're killing us.

42:26.545 --> 42:27.546
Who is?

42:28.464 --> 42:30.215
You have to help us.

42:30.883 --> 42:31.884
Whoa, whoa.

42:32.384 --> 42:33.719
Get him to the clinic.

42:33.886 --> 42:35.846
(gasps, coughs)

42:50.986 --> 42:52.946
I know you're all asking,
why are we still here

42:53.113 --> 42:55.199
when our own government
won't help us?

42:56.241 --> 42:57.576
It's simple.

43:00.412 --> 43:02.664
We're supposed to be giving
these people hope.

43:04.792 --> 43:07.586
Hope that if they're in danger,
someone will come.

43:09.963 --> 43:11.673
We will come.

43:14.176 --> 43:15.469
Suit up!
