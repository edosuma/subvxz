00:04.702 --> 00:06.151
Hello, everyone.

00:06.236 --> 00:07.569
Frederick!

00:07.655 --> 00:10.155
Beatrice.

00:10.240 --> 00:14.459
May I present Miss Celery Savoy
and her bow-wow, Dumpling.

00:16.497 --> 00:18.497
And may I make
the further announcement

00:18.632 --> 00:22.217
that we are engaged...

00:22.336 --> 00:23.919
in...

00:24.004 --> 00:25.837
a soon-to-be-married
agreement.

00:33.597 --> 00:35.097
Celery fucking Savoy

00:35.182 --> 00:36.732
is the President
of the Clambake Club.

00:36.850 --> 00:39.651
It is unbelievable that a sack
of stupid like Frederick

00:39.737 --> 00:43.188
was able to pull
in a human diamond like Celery.

00:43.273 --> 00:45.574
It's like catching
a golden lobster

00:45.693 --> 00:47.109
with a trap made of shit.

00:47.194 --> 00:49.945
Welcome
to the family, Celery!

00:50.030 --> 00:51.697
Congratulations, Frederick.

00:51.782 --> 00:55.033
You've become another cog
in the great marriage industry.

00:55.119 --> 00:57.336
Well, that is very generous
of you to say,

00:57.421 --> 01:02.007
especially since you will never
know the joy of human touch.

01:02.092 --> 01:03.342
Pardon me, Frederick.

01:03.427 --> 01:05.177
I'm afraid
I may not have heard you.

01:05.262 --> 01:07.713
Would you mind re-describing
the nature of your relationship

01:07.798 --> 01:08.964
with Celery?

01:09.049 --> 01:10.549
Well,
it's like my Freddy said.

01:10.684 --> 01:12.551
We're to be married.

01:12.636 --> 01:14.686
Oh, yes.
That's what I thought he said.

01:14.772 --> 01:17.305
I was just a little distracted
by this buzzing in my head

01:17.391 --> 01:20.726
and hot numbness covering
my body and time slowing down.

01:20.811 --> 01:21.810
Frederick!

01:21.895 --> 01:24.196
Uh, uh, I...

01:24.281 --> 01:28.066
I have the most tremendous urge
to make water.

01:28.152 --> 01:29.484
- Oh.
- I-I can't--

01:33.240 --> 01:34.956
That's not
a toilet, Mother!

01:35.075 --> 01:36.875
That's my new best friend!

01:36.960 --> 01:41.413
I'm sure I'm pleased
to make your acquaintance.

01:56.764 --> 01:58.013
Mother didn't just urinate

01:58.098 --> 02:00.098
on our newest and most
important family member.

02:00.234 --> 02:02.434
Peepers,
fetch the urine talcum.

02:02.519 --> 02:05.604
She also urinated on
this family's social standing.

02:05.739 --> 02:07.522
I need to do something
that will force Celery

02:07.608 --> 02:09.657
to take our family
seriously again--

02:09.776 --> 02:12.994
host a 17-course meal
in honor of her dog, Dumpling.

02:15.282 --> 02:17.666
Lady of the house present!

02:17.785 --> 02:19.084
Lady of the house present!

02:19.169 --> 02:20.419
If any of you feel a cough
coming on

02:20.504 --> 02:21.953
or any sort
of facial dampness

02:22.039 --> 02:24.172
please refrain
from breathing.

02:24.291 --> 02:27.292
The puppies
for your perusal, Madam.

02:27.428 --> 02:29.961
Aw, they're all so cute!

02:30.047 --> 02:32.297
Uh, I'll take that one.

02:32.382 --> 02:34.516
Oh, no, no,
um, that one.

02:34.635 --> 02:36.218
Oh, I can't decide!

02:36.303 --> 02:37.803
I'll take them all.

02:37.888 --> 02:40.305
You'll be perfect
for my cape!

02:44.144 --> 02:46.445
Stop trying to escape.

02:50.317 --> 02:53.485
Was that as bad
as I believe it was?

02:53.570 --> 02:57.656
No. Everyone mistakes an heiress
for a water closet

02:57.741 --> 03:00.408
from time to time,
don't they?

03:00.494 --> 03:02.327
I'm sure Celery
counts herself lucky

03:02.463 --> 03:05.130
to be peed on
by the great Dodo Bellacourt.

03:05.215 --> 03:09.468
Oh, heavens,
why must my body fail me so?

03:09.553 --> 03:11.386
In some Asiatic cultures,
relieving oneself

03:11.505 --> 03:15.257
on the guest is considered
a sign of respect.

03:15.342 --> 03:17.092
Would the Madam
like a syringe of the dog?

03:17.177 --> 03:21.346
No. This drug use
simply will not do!

03:21.431 --> 03:25.100
- No more!
- A little won't hurt.

03:25.185 --> 03:27.352
She said, "No more!"

03:29.740 --> 03:32.858
The lady said,
"No more."

03:32.993 --> 03:36.745
You know I had no choice in the
matter of my upcoming marriage.

03:36.864 --> 03:39.748
I'm a senator now,
so I must get engaged.

03:39.867 --> 03:41.533
But I thought that meant
you were going to change the law

03:41.618 --> 03:43.535
so we could marry?

03:43.620 --> 03:47.339
My sweet, shivering tower
of aspic.

03:47.424 --> 03:49.090
Senators
don't make the laws.

03:49.209 --> 03:51.593
They just accept bribes
from corporations.

03:51.712 --> 03:53.879
And until there's a corporation
that cares about siblings

03:54.014 --> 03:56.214
being allowed to marry,
there's nothing we can do.

03:56.350 --> 03:58.266
I hate corporations!

03:58.385 --> 04:01.353
And I hate Celery.

04:01.438 --> 04:03.772
If it makes you feel
any better, I hate her too.

04:03.891 --> 04:06.975
She's smart, well traveled.
She laughs at all my jokes.

04:07.060 --> 04:08.393
It's awkward.

04:10.113 --> 04:11.313
Well, it's fine.

04:11.398 --> 04:12.480
We're just gonna
have to be more careful

04:12.566 --> 04:14.232
when we sneak out
for our lovemaking.

04:14.368 --> 04:18.236
Oh, my sweet, shivering tower
of aspic,

04:18.372 --> 04:20.738
Father said that now
that I'm a senator,

04:20.874 --> 04:22.824
we must stop
our fornicating.

04:22.910 --> 04:24.576
What?

04:24.711 --> 04:26.044
But I love you!

04:26.129 --> 04:28.330
Beatrice.

04:28.415 --> 04:29.748
Beatrice, please--

04:29.833 --> 04:32.751
Please don't do this, Frederick.
I love you.

04:34.588 --> 04:36.087
- Please, please don't do this.
- Baby. Bea.

04:36.173 --> 04:37.756
Please, Frederick,
don't do this.

04:37.891 --> 04:40.642
You're acting like a baby...

04:40.761 --> 04:43.762
like the baby
I first made love to.

04:46.099 --> 04:48.099
But we-- we can't.

04:48.235 --> 04:50.902
We had to grow up sometime.
We can't stay babies forever.

04:50.988 --> 04:52.771
Yes, we can.

04:55.525 --> 04:58.276
I hope we can still be
brother and sister.

05:01.498 --> 05:04.282
We can't stay
babies forever.

05:04.418 --> 05:08.119
We can't stay
babies forever.

05:08.255 --> 05:11.089
We can't stay
babies forever.

05:11.174 --> 05:12.841
We can't stay
babies forever.

05:15.929 --> 05:18.296
Now, remember, Peepers,

05:18.432 --> 05:21.099
no matter how cunningly
or forcefully

05:21.184 --> 05:23.802
I ask you for morphine,
you are to deny me.

05:23.887 --> 05:24.853
Yes, Madam.

05:24.972 --> 05:26.021
It is an order.

05:26.139 --> 05:27.806
Do you understand?

05:27.891 --> 05:29.524
Yes, Madam.

05:29.643 --> 05:31.977
- So may I have some morphine?
- Yes, Madam.

05:32.062 --> 05:34.446
That was a test.

05:34.531 --> 05:36.314
You are not
to give me morphine.

05:36.400 --> 05:37.565
Yes, Madam.

05:37.651 --> 05:39.618
May I please have
some morphine?

05:39.703 --> 05:42.570
- Yes, Madam.
- No! It should be, "No, Madam!"

05:42.656 --> 05:45.790
- Yes, Madam.
- So, again...

05:45.876 --> 05:47.959
can I have some morphine?

05:48.045 --> 05:50.328
- Yes, Madam.
- No!

05:50.414 --> 05:52.497
Don't you understand?

05:52.633 --> 05:56.835
Saying yes to you
is my morphine.

05:56.970 --> 05:59.504
I can stay a baby forever.

05:59.589 --> 06:02.390
I can stay a baby forever.

06:02.509 --> 06:04.592
I can stay a baby forever.

06:11.351 --> 06:14.185
Oh, yeah.

06:14.271 --> 06:16.905
Yeah, yeah.

06:19.526 --> 06:22.861
Oh! My lady,
those are snacking beets

06:22.996 --> 06:25.363
not beautification beets.

06:25.499 --> 06:28.249
How do I look?

06:28.368 --> 06:30.702
Is my lady quite sure
that she wants to rub a beet

06:30.837 --> 06:31.586
into her face?

06:31.705 --> 06:33.838
Mm-hmm.
Quite sure.

06:33.924 --> 06:35.173
And I'm not a lady.

06:35.258 --> 06:36.257
I'm a baby.

06:36.376 --> 06:38.877
I can stay
a baby forever.

06:38.962 --> 06:42.464
I see, my la--
my baby.

06:42.549 --> 06:45.517
Well, I shall place
this here.

06:48.055 --> 06:50.388
Do I need more?

06:50.474 --> 06:53.141
No, I think that's perfect.

06:53.226 --> 06:57.195
Maybe just a little more.
Mm-hmm.

06:57.280 --> 06:59.731
This way. Oops.

06:59.866 --> 07:02.567
- Through, go through!
- Garfield, what are you doing?

07:02.703 --> 07:04.369
I'm about to forever-sleep
these puppies

07:04.454 --> 07:07.706
- for Miss Lillian's cape.
- Oh, fun.

07:07.791 --> 07:10.825
Just wondering, do you think it's
strange that one of your duties

07:10.911 --> 07:13.578
is to kill puppies
for a woman's fashion?

07:13.663 --> 07:16.915
Hmm. No, I never
thought of it that way.

07:17.050 --> 07:19.751
Besides, it's not a cape
of puppies for Miss Lillian.

07:19.836 --> 07:24.305
It's a cape
of puppies for Mayor Cutie.

07:24.424 --> 07:26.257
Come on, push right through, Wiggles.

07:29.555 --> 07:32.722
We begin with two soups--
one hot, one cold--

07:32.808 --> 07:35.108
followed
by pheasant under glass,

07:35.227 --> 07:38.562
succeeded by quails from Egypt,
fattened in Switzerland,

07:38.697 --> 07:42.449
their wings mutilated by
the King of Siam's personal

07:42.568 --> 07:44.067
- wing mutilator...
- Yum.

07:44.203 --> 07:45.569
After which rabbit ears,

07:45.704 --> 07:47.904
which have been chopped
into a <i> salade</i> with...

07:48.040 --> 07:49.789
So how did you two meet?
Was it love at first sight?

07:49.908 --> 07:51.575
How'd Dumpling
get the name Dumpling?

07:51.660 --> 07:52.959
How'd you get the name Celery?
Tell me everything.

07:53.078 --> 07:54.911
Well, me and Freddy
met through your mother.

07:55.047 --> 07:56.546
No love yet,
but here's hoping.

07:56.632 --> 07:58.215
Dumpling got his name
because he looks

07:58.300 --> 07:59.833
like he's filled with potatoes,
and I got the name Celery

07:59.918 --> 08:02.636
because Papa always said
I took more energy than I gave.

08:04.089 --> 08:06.006
Father always tells me
I'm an energy-suck as well.

08:06.091 --> 08:08.925
Who knew we had so much in common?

08:10.846 --> 08:13.647
Our next course
is a halibut from Maine,

08:13.765 --> 08:18.435
lovingly glazed in
an orange-cranberry <i> mostarda.</i>

08:18.520 --> 08:21.438
I have an awkward question
for you, Lillian.

08:21.523 --> 08:24.241
Is that halibut
actually from Maine?

08:24.326 --> 08:27.661
Your butler, Poopers, just said
it, but I assume he was japing.

08:27.779 --> 08:30.030
Poopers, is that halibut
from Maine?

08:30.115 --> 08:32.616
I can almost smell the bearded
fisherman who caught it.

08:32.701 --> 08:34.384
Get rid of that poison!

08:34.486 --> 08:36.119
Garfield,
remove this atrocity at once!

08:36.205 --> 08:38.955
I apologize
one thousand-fold.

08:40.000 --> 08:46.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

08:47.099 --> 08:48.882
You're quite handsome
when you throw out food

08:48.967 --> 08:51.051
a dog has spit out.

08:51.136 --> 08:53.303
Oh, thank you, Chair.

08:53.438 --> 08:55.055
Do you ever wonder
what it would be like to taste

08:55.140 --> 08:57.023
one tiny, little bite?

08:57.142 --> 08:59.476
I know I do,
but I'm not as brave as you.

08:59.561 --> 09:02.112
Maybe you could try it
and tell me what it's like.

09:02.197 --> 09:03.480
No, I could never!

09:03.565 --> 09:04.981
It's an unpardonable offense

09:05.067 --> 09:07.234
to eat that which is designated
for the upstairs.

09:07.319 --> 09:09.236
I must throw it
in the garbage.

09:09.321 --> 09:12.038
I'd love to see
just one small morsel

09:12.157 --> 09:15.875
in your perfect
little mouth.

09:17.212 --> 09:19.296
Well, I...

09:19.381 --> 09:23.250
guess I could have
one little nibble.

09:23.335 --> 09:25.001
Yes.

09:27.639 --> 09:29.673
It's like
a flaky little cloud!

09:29.758 --> 09:31.341
What did you say
this was called, again?

09:31.426 --> 09:33.843
- Food.
- Well, if this is food,

09:33.929 --> 09:35.679
then I'm glad
to have tried it.

09:35.764 --> 09:38.732
It makes working for gruel
that much more rewarding,

09:38.850 --> 09:42.686
knowing that real food is going
to its rightful place, upstairs.

09:42.771 --> 09:45.655
Well, I surely enjoyed
watching you do it.

09:45.741 --> 09:49.526
Well, then I am glad
to have danced with the fire.

09:59.421 --> 10:01.538
Product of a rape.

10:01.673 --> 10:03.173
Product of a rape.

10:03.258 --> 10:06.710
A double product of a rape.

10:06.795 --> 10:11.131
Now, you listen to me, girls,
especially you, Frederick!

10:11.216 --> 10:15.385
I've never told you this before,
but I love you.

10:37.376 --> 10:41.077
Bananas flambé.

10:49.304 --> 10:52.472
They don't like it.
Throw it away. Throw it away.

11:00.098 --> 11:03.066
I'm so sorry.

11:03.151 --> 11:05.568
Celery, I would like
to take this moment, if I may,

11:05.654 --> 11:08.238
to present a gift
to our most esteemed guest.

11:08.323 --> 11:11.408
Oh, Lillian, you didn't have
to get me anything.

11:11.493 --> 11:14.861
No, it's for Dumpling.

11:14.946 --> 11:17.113
Dumpling...

11:17.249 --> 11:18.832
please accept this gift

11:18.950 --> 11:23.370
on behalf of the entire
Bellacourt family.

11:23.455 --> 11:24.621
Oh, what a heavenly necklace.

11:24.756 --> 11:27.173
If only Dumpling
liked wearing emeralds.

11:27.292 --> 11:29.759
He's finicky,
but he really knows himself.

11:29.845 --> 11:31.795
I admire that about him.

11:34.466 --> 11:35.799
She's been acting this way

11:35.934 --> 11:37.967
ever since Frederick
announced his engagement.

11:38.053 --> 11:39.803
Has she done this kind of thing before?

11:39.888 --> 11:43.440
Once. Frederick invited a
young duchess to the cotillion,

11:43.525 --> 11:47.110
and Beatrice buried herself
alive in the radish garden.

11:47.195 --> 11:49.312
But this time
it seems serious.

11:49.398 --> 11:52.482
Oh, it's kielbasa time.

11:52.567 --> 11:54.984
I must be going.
I will leave this to you.

12:01.076 --> 12:04.825
Well, I see Miss Beatrice
is dressed like a little girl.

12:05.115 --> 12:07.354
Baby Bea, if you please.

12:07.400 --> 12:09.200
How long have
you been a baby?

12:09.285 --> 12:10.618
Mm-mm-mm.

12:10.737 --> 12:13.904
Was it since
someone hurt you?

12:13.990 --> 12:17.208
And was that person
your brother, Freddy?

12:22.048 --> 12:23.247
Morphine!

12:27.503 --> 12:28.919
Control yourself, Madam!

12:29.055 --> 12:33.257
Damn it, man!
I need my sweet cherry dreams!

12:33.393 --> 12:35.509
I need to waltz
with the White Widow!

12:35.595 --> 12:37.228
Don't you remember?

12:37.313 --> 12:41.932
Don't you know the depths that
your addiction has taken you to?

12:42.018 --> 12:44.485
You sucked my dick, Madam!

12:46.739 --> 12:49.407
Madam, I cannot allow
such a proposition.

12:49.492 --> 12:52.777
Unbutton!

12:52.862 --> 12:54.278
Oh!

12:54.364 --> 12:55.863
You sucked my dick.

12:55.948 --> 12:56.947
I--

13:01.788 --> 13:03.287
Mayor Cutie
used to hate champagne,

13:03.423 --> 13:05.289
but then I just didn't give
her water for two weeks,

13:05.375 --> 13:06.424
and now she loves it.

13:06.509 --> 13:08.175
I remember when Mother
did that to me.

13:08.294 --> 13:12.296
Speaking of mothers, I'd like
to apologize for our mother.

13:12.382 --> 13:13.798
You mean
when she urinated on me?

13:13.883 --> 13:16.133
Think nothing of it.
These sorts of things happen.

13:16.219 --> 13:18.185
Well, I just want to make sure
that you understand

13:18.304 --> 13:20.688
that the Bellacourts, except for
Hortense, are a wonderful family

13:20.807 --> 13:24.275
with high ethics
and Christian values.

13:24.360 --> 13:26.360
- Hi, Frederick.
- Aah!

13:26.479 --> 13:28.696
Beatrice.

13:28.815 --> 13:32.283
♪ daddy wouldn't buy me
a bow-wow, bow-wow ♪

13:32.368 --> 13:36.070
♪ daddy wouldn't buy me

13:36.155 --> 13:38.205

13:38.324 --> 13:40.991

13:41.077 --> 13:44.578

13:44.664 --> 13:48.382

13:48.501 --> 13:51.719
♪ daddy wouldn't buy me

13:51.838 --> 13:53.637
- Beatrice.
- Remember this song?

13:53.723 --> 13:55.389
Remember this song?
This was our song.

13:55.508 --> 13:58.976
♪ daddy wouldn't buy me
a bow-wow ♪

14:01.564 --> 14:02.980
Okay, that is quite enough
of that.

14:03.065 --> 14:05.232
This is inappropriate
and highly erotic.

14:05.351 --> 14:06.650
I am an engaged man.

14:06.736 --> 14:08.486
Also,
she is your sister.

14:08.571 --> 14:11.355
Yes, there is that
as well.

14:11.491 --> 14:13.691
Fine!

14:24.838 --> 14:26.588
I hope that my sister
straddling my lap

14:26.723 --> 14:28.256
was not the worst thing
you have ever seen.

14:28.391 --> 14:30.642
I assure you, it is not.

14:30.760 --> 14:31.976
The worst thing I ever saw

14:32.095 --> 14:34.229
was an elephant
being hanged for no other reason

14:34.314 --> 14:37.148
than to amuse a large crowd
on a hot summer afternoon.

14:37.267 --> 14:40.134
Oh, summer really
is the best time for a hanging.

14:40.237 --> 14:42.320
Well, the beast

14:42.439 --> 14:45.740
was given large quantities
of ether prior to the execution.

14:45.825 --> 14:47.775
Chains were placed
around its neck

14:47.861 --> 14:50.328
to draw upon his windpipe
and choke him to death.

14:50.447 --> 14:51.613
Well, as the derrick rose,

14:51.748 --> 14:53.281
the beast
let out a terrific scream

14:53.366 --> 14:56.701
from paralysis of the spinal cord
and was dead within minutes.

14:56.786 --> 15:00.505
There was blood
everywhere.

15:06.880 --> 15:09.514
Oh, well, I hope
you brought a picnic.

15:09.633 --> 15:11.099
Tell me,
how much blood do you suppose

15:11.184 --> 15:13.134
could be drained
from an elephant?

15:13.270 --> 15:14.969
I believe enough
for a canoe ride.

15:15.055 --> 15:19.607
Can you imagine canoeing
on a lake of elephant blood?

15:19.693 --> 15:22.310
I believe
it would be magical.

15:23.730 --> 15:25.813
I believe it would be magical
as well.

15:25.949 --> 15:27.398
Lillian, once upon a time,

15:27.484 --> 15:30.485
I thought you were
a useless, unlovable, vile,

15:30.570 --> 15:31.786
tacky little thing.

15:31.871 --> 15:33.821
But now I see
you are quite amusing.

15:33.957 --> 15:37.542
Oh, Celery, I've been wanting
to be your friend for 30 years,

15:37.661 --> 15:40.328
and I'm only 27.

15:40.413 --> 15:42.880
Today means the world to me.

15:44.551 --> 15:46.634
I wanted to ask you
a little question.

15:46.720 --> 15:49.003
Oh, Garfieldella,
if it's a girl.

15:49.089 --> 15:52.173
And, of course, Peepers Junior,
were we to have a son.

15:52.258 --> 15:55.009
Not my question,
but I'm glad to know it.

15:55.095 --> 15:56.894
I was wondering
if you had an extra key

15:57.013 --> 15:58.513
to Dodo's morphine cabinet.

15:58.598 --> 16:01.149
I wanted to impress you and show
you how clean I can make it.

16:01.234 --> 16:03.685
Why yes, of-- of course,
as underbutler,

16:03.770 --> 16:05.353
it is my privilege
to carry that key.

16:05.488 --> 16:07.572
Can I borrow it?
It will only take an hour.

16:07.691 --> 16:08.856
I'll make it shine.

16:08.942 --> 16:10.441
Oh, I'm sorry, Chair,

16:10.527 --> 16:12.744
but it would be breaking one of
the cardinal rules of the house,

16:12.862 --> 16:14.862
letting a woman hold a key.

16:14.998 --> 16:16.864
I know you can break
the rules.

16:16.950 --> 16:18.449
I saw you try
the halibut.

16:18.535 --> 16:21.419
Halibut is one thing,
but heroin is quite another.

16:21.538 --> 16:23.871
Now, I don't expect you
to understand the difference,

16:23.957 --> 16:27.508
but one is a drug,
and the other is fish.

16:27.594 --> 16:29.127
Please?

16:29.212 --> 16:34.182
You're such a big,
strong underbutler.

16:41.191 --> 16:44.859
Romantic fraternization
between the staff

16:44.944 --> 16:47.528
is the ultimate
rule violation.

16:47.614 --> 16:48.896
This is a terrible thing
to say

16:49.032 --> 16:51.315
to the hopeful future mother
of my children,

16:51.401 --> 16:54.235
but I am going to have
to report you.

16:54.371 --> 16:57.121
I will never, ever forget
this moment.

17:02.996 --> 17:05.463
Neither will I.

17:05.582 --> 17:07.248
Sorry?

17:07.333 --> 17:09.751
- No, nothing.
- Oh.

17:09.836 --> 17:12.420
I thought I heard
you say, "Neither will I."

17:12.555 --> 17:13.755
No.

17:13.839 --> 17:17.558
Right.
Well, off to report you.

17:17.644 --> 17:20.261
Thank you
very much, again.

17:22.598 --> 17:24.598
You've had quite an adventure
tonight, Madam.

17:24.684 --> 17:27.902
All that exercise
is bad for the uterus.

17:31.858 --> 17:33.608
- Sir?
- What is it, Chair?

17:33.693 --> 17:36.744
I'm afraid I have a terribly
important issue to discuss.

17:36.830 --> 17:38.613
What is it?

17:38.748 --> 17:40.948
Have you counted
the towels recently?

17:41.034 --> 17:43.167
I believe one is missing.

17:43.286 --> 17:45.203
Madam, please excuse me
for a moment

17:45.288 --> 17:46.754
while I tend to our guests.

17:46.840 --> 17:50.708
It seems Dumpling is not pleased
with our digestif selection.

17:50.794 --> 17:54.178
Chair will continue
mopping your junkie sweats.

17:59.969 --> 18:03.888
My lady, if you are in need of
just a touch of your morphine,

18:03.973 --> 18:06.891
you need only ask.

18:06.976 --> 18:08.643
Do you miss it?

18:08.728 --> 18:09.811
What I miss
are the days

18:09.896 --> 18:11.896
when if a servant
asked you a question,

18:11.981 --> 18:14.649
you could have
their tongue cut out.

18:14.734 --> 18:19.403
797, 798, 799.

18:19.489 --> 18:21.906
I have counted these towels
13 times,

18:21.991 --> 18:25.293
and each time
the number is 799.

18:25.378 --> 18:27.962
Bellacourt Manor
is an 800-towel estate.

18:28.047 --> 18:29.797
Whomever stole the towel,
please step forward.

18:29.883 --> 18:33.050
You'll be fired immediately,
no questions asked.

18:36.973 --> 18:38.923
- Garfield.
- Hmm?

18:39.008 --> 18:41.058
Garfield,
empty your breast.

18:45.265 --> 18:47.398
Is that a towel I see?

18:47.517 --> 18:49.517
Who?

18:49.652 --> 18:50.852
This is Towel?

18:50.937 --> 18:53.437
Chair gave her to me.

18:53.523 --> 18:54.655
And she kissed me.

18:56.242 --> 18:58.743
Enough!
It is stolen property!

18:58.862 --> 19:00.695
Garfield Leopold McGillicutty,

19:00.830 --> 19:03.915
you are hereby stripped of all
duties befitting an underbutler.

19:04.033 --> 19:05.416
Please remove your uniform

19:05.535 --> 19:07.785
and vacate the premises
immediately.

19:07.871 --> 19:10.454
You may pick up the clothes
you wore when you arrived.

19:10.540 --> 19:13.341
But when I came here,
I was six years old.

19:13.426 --> 19:16.043
Yes, back
when I saw something in you,

19:16.179 --> 19:21.015
something
that reminded me of...

19:21.100 --> 19:24.602
Servants, turn away.

19:26.272 --> 19:30.057
Nicholas, bang the pot.

19:31.144 --> 19:33.611
Dead man walking.

19:34.814 --> 19:37.064
Slower, Nick, slower.

19:48.077 --> 19:50.578
Go, boy.

19:50.713 --> 19:54.582
Go and find your way
in this wicked world.

20:01.438 --> 20:04.690
Well, I'm off to meet
and impress Celery's family.

20:04.775 --> 20:06.441
Thank you
for your hospitality, Lillian.

20:06.577 --> 20:08.076
Oh, if you're ever in need
of a plus-one

20:08.162 --> 20:09.828
to an elephant hanging,
you know who to call.

20:09.947 --> 20:11.530
I won't hesitate!

20:11.615 --> 20:13.782
You know,
you may have strange sisters,

20:13.918 --> 20:15.367
and your mother
is quite awful,

20:15.452 --> 20:17.035
and your brother seems to have
an erotic relationship

20:17.121 --> 20:20.088
to elephant death
and his own sister, but you...

20:20.174 --> 20:23.208
I like you, Lillian.
You throw one hell of a party.

20:23.294 --> 20:26.295
Let's grab tea
or an aperitif this week.

20:31.468 --> 20:32.601
Okay!

20:32.686 --> 20:34.219
Well, the party
had some slight hiccups,

20:34.305 --> 20:37.376
what with Beatrice's
nervous-breakdown incest-treptease.

20:37.377 --> 20:40.174
But, in the end,
Celery seems to be really impressed.

20:40.175 --> 20:41.630
What can I say?

20:41.631 --> 20:43.169
I throw one hell
of a party.
