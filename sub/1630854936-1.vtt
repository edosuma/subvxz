18:26.741 --> 18:28.509
No, I'm just- I'm worried.

18:28.543 --> 18:30.243
I mean, you know,
she's very-

18:31.946 --> 18:33.848
she's not a lesbian.

18:33.881 --> 18:36.416
Are you sure? Because, you know-

18:40.220 --> 18:41.923
Would you mind
not hitting on my sister

18:41.956 --> 18:43.591
at my birthday party please?

18:43.625 --> 18:44.759
I would mind.

18:46.226 --> 18:47.528
But I won't.

18:47.562 --> 18:49.429
It will be my present to you.

18:49.463 --> 18:50.765
Wow, thank you so much.

18:50.798 --> 18:53.266
-AMANDINE: Happy birthday.
-Yeah, I'll treasure it.

18:53.300 --> 18:54.902
-AMANDINE: You should.
-Have a great time.

18:54.936 --> 18:56.771
-AMANDINE: You too.
-Not too great.

18:56.804 --> 18:59.206
[Amandine chuckles]

19:05.278 --> 19:07.447
Oh, shit. Oh shit.

19:07.481 --> 19:09.483
-Oh shit.
-No one told me about this.

19:09.517 --> 19:10.484
MEERA:
There's just no good-
you know what?

19:10.518 --> 19:11.753
Every 10 minutes
I have to go.

19:11.786 --> 19:13.220
Sweetheart, you can get lasers.

19:13.253 --> 19:14.822
It'll zip that right back up.

19:14.856 --> 19:16.591
Yeah, it's called
a mommy makeover.

19:16.624 --> 19:19.727
They stick a laser up there
and just tighten it all up.

19:19.761 --> 19:22.262
It went from Basset Hound
to Chihuahua. Worth every penny.

19:22.295 --> 19:23.965
Oh!

19:23.998 --> 19:25.566
-Wow.
-MEERA: Stop.

19:25.600 --> 19:27.300
KAHLIL:
You know it's true.

19:27.334 --> 19:28.569
[Meera laughing]

19:28.603 --> 19:30.370
You got kids?

19:30.404 --> 19:32.807
-No.
-Husband?

19:32.840 --> 19:34.341
Not anymore.

19:34.374 --> 19:35.943
BARBARA:
You should keep your distance.

19:35.977 --> 19:38.245
You might get baby fever.

19:38.278 --> 19:40.615
I'm not kidding.
Happened to me.

19:40.648 --> 19:41.849
All my friends
started having kids.

19:41.883 --> 19:43.951
I thought I should have kids.

19:43.985 --> 19:45.787
All these friends,

19:45.820 --> 19:47.989
they're gonna be gone
once she pops a baby out.

19:48.022 --> 19:49.791
She'll make new friends.

19:49.824 --> 19:51.626
The kids' friend's parents.

19:51.659 --> 19:53.628
And she'll think
she has new "interests."

19:53.661 --> 19:56.731
But they're really
the kids' interests.

19:56.764 --> 19:59.567
And when the kids graduate,
poof, gone so.

19:59.600 --> 20:02.870
All these people she
invested all her time with,

20:02.904 --> 20:06.373
she'll realize she has
nothing in common with them.

20:06.406 --> 20:08.810
And then she'll realize
that her husband

20:08.843 --> 20:10.343
is staying too late at work.

20:11.579 --> 20:13.681
So, she'll shoot her
face fill with Botox,

20:13.715 --> 20:15.382
get a boob job.

20:15.415 --> 20:16.483
Get a mommy makeover?

20:16.517 --> 20:18.019
Exactly.

20:18.052 --> 20:20.822
To chase what she
used to look like.

20:20.855 --> 20:24.759
before the kids literally
suck the life out of her.

20:24.792 --> 20:27.427
Instead, she'll just look like
she's trying too hard.

20:27.461 --> 20:29.664
And he'll leave her for
an actual 20-year-old.

20:29.697 --> 20:31.032
Who loves giving blowjobs?

20:31.065 --> 20:33.634
Fucking blowjobs.

20:33.668 --> 20:35.737
[Barbara chuckles]

20:35.770 --> 20:37.672
All because she thought
it'd make her life complete

20:37.705 --> 20:39.473
-to have a baby.
-Oh, no, no.

20:39.507 --> 20:42.442
That's got Molly's
lipstick on it.

20:42.476 --> 20:44.612
-I think this is your shade.
-Thank you.

20:44.645 --> 20:47.915
I mean, you don't regret
having babies, right?

20:47.949 --> 20:49.717
Oh, no. God, no.

20:49.751 --> 20:51.786
They're the loves of my life.

20:51.819 --> 20:54.387
As much as I hate my ex,
I'll always be grateful to him

20:54.421 --> 20:55.990
for giving me my babies.

20:57.357 --> 20:59.927
Listen to me,
don't listen to me.

20:59.961 --> 21:01.529
I just need to get laid.

21:03.430 --> 21:05.465
Okay.
We get what you wish for.

21:06.667 --> 21:10.370
On that note,
I think I'm ready.

21:11.606 --> 21:12.874
-AMANDINE: Alright.
-REESE: Do you snorkle?

21:12.907 --> 21:15.076
No, I never get into the ocean.

21:15.109 --> 21:17.044
Oh god, what do I say?

21:17.078 --> 21:19.847
Tell him how wet your pussy is.
They love that.

21:19.881 --> 21:21.983
I hate that word.

21:22.016 --> 21:23.050
Pussy?

21:23.084 --> 21:24.051
JACLYN:
Yeah.

21:24.085 --> 21:25.586
What do you say?

21:25.620 --> 21:27.622
I don't.

21:27.655 --> 21:30.658
So, when you told Todd to like-

21:30.691 --> 21:32.627
Oh, we didn't talk during-

21:33.928 --> 21:35.997
Or before.

21:37.464 --> 21:38.966
Or after.

21:39.000 --> 21:40.968
Oh God.

21:41.002 --> 21:42.670
Okay, so tonight,

21:42.703 --> 21:45.740
you're gonna say
some nasty pornstar shit.

21:45.773 --> 21:47.708
Just get disgusting.

21:47.742 --> 21:50.111
Yeah, but that's not me.

21:50.144 --> 21:53.480
I know that's not you.
But tonight, you're not you.

21:53.514 --> 21:56.818
Okay? You're not the NPR-loving,
farmer's market going,

21:56.851 --> 21:58.351
avocado toast eating Jaclyn.

21:58.385 --> 21:59.486
You're gonna be
something different.

21:59.520 --> 22:01.889
You're the Onlyfans, like
Jacklina.

22:01.923 --> 22:03.691
You're gonna be
a slut tonight, okay?

22:03.724 --> 22:04.725
Yeah, okay. Okay.

22:04.759 --> 22:06.127
You're a slut.

22:06.160 --> 22:07.962
-Well, huh.
-Slut. Slut

22:09.897 --> 22:11.532
-REESE: Really?
-MJ: Yeah.

22:11.566 --> 22:12.667
REESE: You've never been to
swimming?
Hey. Hey. Hi.

22:12.700 --> 22:14.467
Oh.

22:14.502 --> 22:15.703
REESE:
You like surfing?

22:15.736 --> 22:17.839
MJ:
Huh, no, I would never surf.

22:19.106 --> 22:21.609
So, you'd never- you just-- you
never do it?

22:21.642 --> 22:23.511
MJ:
No, I'm scared of sharks.

22:23.544 --> 22:25.146
REESE:
There is great white sharks
that you should be scared of.

22:25.179 --> 22:26.714
But they're east coast, man.

22:28.616 --> 22:29.449
All the west coast sharks
are white sharks.

22:29.482 --> 22:30.885
I got you, girl.

22:30.918 --> 22:31.986
REESE:
Cuddly nice sharks.

22:32.019 --> 22:34.487
You gotta get out there.

Okay. Am I in trouble?

22:39.994 --> 22:41.128
No.

Ugh, God, I need a drink.

22:48.169 --> 22:50.470
Your glass is right there,

Oh no, molly.

22:56.010 --> 22:56.944
Molly, that's Molly in there.

22:56.978 --> 22:58.179
You drank it all.

22:58.212 --> 22:59.580
That's all of it.

22:59.614 --> 23:00.948
It's gone.

It's in your body now.

Okay, you're sure that
you want me to do this?

more clear.

a condom or anything.

23:54.635 --> 23:56.070
Oh, ah!

23:56.103 --> 23:57.038
You know, I don't want to
assume
when I go out this-

23:57.071 --> 23:59.073
I just- it's just in the bag.

23:59.106 --> 24:01.842
There's a-Oh,

-Well, no, I mean I've had sex.
-Yeah, okay, good. That's great.

It's just us here.

24:22.063 --> 24:23.631
Wait, that's not true.
That's not true.

24:23.664 --> 24:25.498
Actually when I was in college,

24:25.533 --> 24:26.734
my girlfriend and I,
we went camping.

having sex in there loudly.

to turn you on.

love to kiss you.

and called me a sell-out

36:03.731 --> 36:07.300
because I painted a mural
for YouTube.

36:07.334 --> 36:09.469
One mural, okay?

36:09.504 --> 36:12.272
Diego Rivera did
his best work for Rockefeller.

36:12.305 --> 36:13.373
Commissioned mural.

36:13.574 --> 36:15.910
The Sistine Chapel was
a commissioned mural.

36:15.943 --> 36:18.278
Commerce and art.
Corporate art.

36:18.311 --> 36:20.447
What's the big deal?
Now- now my ex is going out

36:20.480 --> 36:21.949
with some 50-year-old.

36:21.983 --> 36:25.218
He's 50. He designs food courts
at malls, okay?

36:25.252 --> 36:26.521
-I'm a sell out?
-Oh, fuck off.

36:27.722 --> 36:29.590
I'm sorry.
I haven't had the pleasure.

36:29.624 --> 36:31.258
And you're not going to.

36:31.291 --> 36:32.994
All the men here have
younger wives.

36:33.027 --> 36:34.394
Look.

36:34.428 --> 36:37.397
Our hosts, your patrons,
seven years apart.

36:37.431 --> 36:38.933
TIM:
Well, he looks old.
He has no hair.

36:38.966 --> 36:42.235
BARBARA:
Preggo and Deer in Headlights,
more like ten years.

36:42.269 --> 36:43.771
Silver fox and Kim Kardashian.

36:43.805 --> 36:46.774
And especially Surf and Turf.

36:46.808 --> 36:48.810
Why do you think that is?

36:50.778 --> 36:52.747
All women are gold diggers?

36:52.780 --> 36:55.616
Supply and demand.

36:55.650 --> 36:59.219
There's not much demand
for aging aimless artist.

37:00.353 --> 37:01.689
But you two have fun.

37:04.525 --> 37:06.493
I think I'm in love.

37:06.527 --> 37:09.396
You look kind of cute when
you get your ass handed to you.

37:09.429 --> 37:10.932
-Thank you.
-Yeah.

37:10.965 --> 37:13.366
Hey Tim, I love it.

37:13.400 --> 37:15.636
Thank you so much, again.

37:15.670 --> 37:17.370
Although, I'm gonna have to
hide it in my office

37:17.404 --> 37:20.373
so Molly doesn't get sad
every time I take my shirt off.

37:20.407 --> 37:23.443
Thank you. I was trying to
convey the feeling of freedom.

37:23.477 --> 37:25.412
Oh, yeah.

37:25.445 --> 37:27.915
Yes, sounds like somebody surfs.

37:27.949 --> 37:29.316
Not as much as
I'd like to.

37:29.517 --> 37:30.818
Heard that, my man.
Yeah, when I'm out there, man-

37:30.852 --> 37:33.921
Shh, you talk too much.

37:33.955 --> 37:35.556
Stop talking.

37:35.590 --> 37:37.324
I didn't really say anything.

37:37.357 --> 37:38.993
Oh, Tim.

37:39.026 --> 37:41.796
You have to show Jaclyn
all of your art.

37:41.829 --> 37:43.664
We have so many of his pieces.

37:43.698 --> 37:44.732
We have a lot.

37:44.766 --> 37:46.534
They're basically my Borgias.

37:46.567 --> 37:48.368
You're so funny.

37:48.401 --> 37:49.837
He's so funny.

37:49.871 --> 37:51.773
And good looking, huh?

37:51.806 --> 37:53.541
Sure, yeah, hmm-mm.

37:53.574 --> 37:56.878
MOLLY:
Yeah, why don't you go
on the gallery walk upstairs?

37:56.911 --> 37:58.378
No, I thought nobody
was allowed upstairs.

37:58.411 --> 38:00.313
No, special people
are allowed upstairs.

38:00.347 --> 38:01.481
Oh.

38:01.516 --> 38:02.984
Go, go, go, go.

38:03.017 --> 38:05.553
Got it, yeah.
I'll show you upstairs.

38:05.586 --> 38:06.721
Okay.

38:08.421 --> 38:09.891
Okay, what?
I don't-

38:09.924 --> 38:11.692
You what?

38:11.726 --> 38:12.860
What?

38:12.894 --> 38:15.830
I do. You don't. I do.

38:15.863 --> 38:17.031
[Geoff laughing]

38:17.064 --> 38:18.699
Do you wanna go
have a glass of water?

38:18.733 --> 38:20.433
TIM:
There's a dog.

38:20.467 --> 38:21.636
Another dog.

38:23.504 --> 38:25.006
Dog.

38:25.039 --> 38:28.943
Dog. Baby, baby, baby, baby.
There's a good one this way.

38:32.479 --> 38:33.748
[Jaclyn sighs]

38:35.850 --> 38:38.019
And a life study.

38:39.153 --> 38:40.353
That's Molly.

38:41.488 --> 38:43.090
I'm not at liberty to say.

38:47.628 --> 38:51.566
Ah, well, I- it's lovely.

38:51.599 --> 38:54.969
You know, the use of your
brush strokes

38:55.002 --> 38:57.038
and colors.

38:57.071 --> 38:59.439
Please, please, please stop.

38:59.472 --> 39:02.375
Can we please not
talk about my work?

39:02.409 --> 39:06.346
Okay. Let's, huh--
let's talk about you.

39:07.882 --> 39:10.483
That sounds even worse.
How about we talk about you?

39:12.086 --> 39:14.555
How about-
how about we don't talk?

39:16.157 --> 39:17.457
Okay.

39:17.490 --> 39:19.594
[kisses]

39:19.627 --> 39:20.895
Yes.

39:20.928 --> 39:22.730
Yeah. I love this.

39:22.763 --> 39:24.599
I love this. Stop, stop.

39:24.632 --> 39:27.702
I love this.
I love all of your features.

39:27.735 --> 39:29.570
All of it.
And when you speak,

39:29.604 --> 39:31.606
you speak with
so much expression.

39:31.639 --> 39:33.975
This here. This.

39:34.008 --> 39:35.576
I wanna paint you.

39:35.610 --> 39:36.744
Okay.

39:36.777 --> 39:38.880
[kisses]

39:38.913 --> 39:40.181
Okay.

39:40.214 --> 39:41.749
Oh, yeah.

39:41.782 --> 39:44.785
It's so refreshing to be
with an older woman.

39:44.819 --> 39:47.722
Just past all this
baby bullshit.

39:47.755 --> 39:48.856
You know?

39:48.890 --> 39:50.925
And all these
fucking gold diggers.

39:50.958 --> 39:52.927
I only wanna be
with older women

39:52.960 --> 39:55.529
who are post menopausal.

39:55.563 --> 39:56.931
How old do you think I am?

39:59.499 --> 40:00.433
I wasn't talking about you.

40:01.501 --> 40:02.904
Oh, oh.

40:02.937 --> 40:06.473
[breaths heavily]

40:07.842 --> 40:10.645
Yes, you have a bush.

40:11.913 --> 40:13.648
You have actual pubic hair.

40:13.681 --> 40:15.883
You have actual pubic hair.

40:17.818 --> 40:20.621
I've been working
with these life study models.

40:20.655 --> 40:21.889
And they're all
completely shaved.

40:21.923 --> 40:23.024
They look like barbie dolls.

40:23.291 --> 40:25.059
It's perverse. You know,
they look like little girls.

40:25.092 --> 40:26.961
Who wants to make love
with little girls?

40:26.994 --> 40:28.162
Hopefully nobody.

40:28.195 --> 40:29.931
-Exactly.
-Yeah.

40:29.964 --> 40:31.933
All these women
mutilating their bodies

40:31.966 --> 40:33.834
to live up to
some imagined standard

40:33.868 --> 40:35.670
the patriarchy has set for them.

40:37.071 --> 40:39.740
Why do women have to be
perfect little C-cups

40:39.774 --> 40:41.142
and be completely shaved,
you know?

40:41.175 --> 40:42.643
They don't, they don't know?

40:42.677 --> 40:44.211
Let it grow.
Let it go wild.

40:44.245 --> 40:48.149
Let it go untamed. Get in my
mouth, wild long pussy hair.

40:48.182 --> 40:49.617
Or maybe just- I mean

40:49.650 --> 40:51.986
I think I prefer
just a little trimmed.

40:52.019 --> 40:54.789
No, you're wrong.
Let it go.

40:54.822 --> 40:56.657
Live in your skin.

40:56.691 --> 41:00.628
All the years that you've
lived, all of that hair,

41:00.661 --> 41:02.964
all of your blemishes,

41:02.997 --> 41:06.067
all of these sunspots,
these liver spots

41:06.100 --> 41:08.736
all of them.
All of these age spots.

41:08.769 --> 41:10.171
All of these herpes scars here.

41:10.204 --> 41:11.772
All of these wrinkles.

41:11.806 --> 41:14.208
Wrinkle, wrinkle, wrinkle.
Wrinkle, wrinkle, wrinkle.

41:14.241 --> 41:17.812
It's your imperfections
that make you perfect.

41:19.947 --> 41:21.682
Nope, can't do it.

41:22.984 --> 41:25.019
What do you want me to say here?

41:25.052 --> 41:27.121
Honestly, nothing.

41:27.154 --> 41:30.024
Because everything
that comes out of your mouth

41:30.057 --> 41:32.793
is just drying me up.

41:32.827 --> 41:34.061
I'm trying to
compliment you here.

41:35.563 --> 41:37.198
And that's what you landed on?

41:37.231 --> 41:39.133
I'm not trying to be a dick.

41:39.166 --> 41:41.769
Oh, well then,
it must just come naturally.

41:43.237 --> 41:44.905
Hey, hey.

41:46.207 --> 41:48.275
I'm just trying
to do you a solid.

41:48.309 --> 41:49.844
A what?

41:49.877 --> 41:52.146
Molly told me that you
needed to fuck the pain away

41:52.179 --> 41:53.247
and so do I.

41:53.280 --> 41:56.217
We're the same.
You said it.

41:56.250 --> 41:59.587
I think the best idea is
for us to let our bodies

41:59.620 --> 42:00.654
do the talking.

42:01.856 --> 42:03.958
-Ouch!
-I think the best idea

42:03.991 --> 42:05.926
is for you to never ever touch
me again.

42:11.932 --> 42:13.701
My painting hand.

42:13.734 --> 42:16.270
AMANDINE:
There she is, there she is.

42:16.303 --> 42:17.938
Hello, how was it?

42:17.972 --> 42:19.874
I want the dets.
I want the dirty, dirty dets.

42:19.907 --> 42:21.042
That was fast.

42:21.075 --> 42:22.843
That didn't happen.

42:22.877 --> 42:25.780
No. Why didn't you do Tim?

42:25.813 --> 42:28.582
Maybe I would've if he didn't
treat me like a pity fuck.

42:28.616 --> 42:30.017
You're supposed to find me
nice guys.

42:30.051 --> 42:31.619
So, I can have nice babies.

42:31.652 --> 42:33.921
Well, you meant also
cute and artistic

42:33.954 --> 42:35.723
and funny and smart.

42:36.991 --> 42:38.793
I got four out of five
ain't bad.

42:38.826 --> 42:40.861
And look, you're gonna
love my guy.

42:40.895 --> 42:43.864
I don't know.
I think I'm good, you guys.

42:43.898 --> 42:45.232
No, you're not good.

42:45.266 --> 42:47.234
I know you don't want
to roll the dice with MJ.

42:47.268 --> 42:48.335
It's just one person.

42:48.369 --> 42:49.804
And it's MJ.

42:49.837 --> 42:51.205
[breaths heavily]

42:51.238 --> 42:54.842
Okay, fine.
But he has got to go.

42:54.875 --> 42:57.111
No, I can't kick out Tim.

42:57.144 --> 42:59.080
Yes you can.
It's your house.

42:59.113 --> 43:01.215
But do I have to?

43:01.248 --> 43:04.385
Yes, you do.
Sisters before misters.

43:04.418 --> 43:07.254
That's easy for you to say.
You don't have a mister.

43:07.288 --> 43:08.622
-She's right.
-Thank you.

43:08.823 --> 43:11.325
Sisters before misters.
That's what we always say.

43:11.358 --> 43:14.061
-We do.
-Oh, but poor Tim. Oh.

43:14.095 --> 43:16.797
-JACLYN: Poor Tim?
-Poor tiny Tim.

43:16.831 --> 43:19.400
Wait, is he tiny?
Or is he big?

43:19.433 --> 43:21.001
Or is he little?
I don't wanna know.

43:21.035 --> 43:22.803
Because I don't want anybody-
I do wanna know.

43:22.837 --> 43:24.672
But I don't wanna know.
But I do wanna-

43:24.705 --> 43:28.242
It's like killing me.
It's tearing me apart.

43:28.275 --> 43:31.145
Stress is the future, right?
Choking the present.

43:32.379 --> 43:34.882
-GEOFF: Okay.
-What you guys all need

43:34.915 --> 43:36.217
is more time on the ocean.

43:36.250 --> 43:37.885
-GEOFF: Ah, yes.
-REESE: You know.

43:37.918 --> 43:40.721
Wow, wow, wow. Thank you.

43:40.754 --> 43:42.790
[indistinct chatter in
background]

43:44.058 --> 43:47.161
So, I heard it didn't go well.

43:47.194 --> 43:50.865
So, you should probably leave
so it's not weird.

43:50.898 --> 43:53.801
Because I don't want it
to be weird for Geoff.

43:53.834 --> 43:54.935
I should leave?
No, no, no.

43:54.969 --> 43:56.871
I'm friends with both of you.

43:56.904 --> 43:58.372
She's the one who should leave.
She should leave.

43:58.405 --> 44:01.008
That's not gonna happen, Tim.

44:01.041 --> 44:02.977
But it's okay.
But it's okay that you go.

44:03.010 --> 44:05.246
Because you know well,
we love you.

44:05.279 --> 44:07.948
And you know what? It's always
okay. You should go.

44:07.982 --> 44:10.151
No, no, no. Maybe- maybe
I don't wanna-

44:10.184 --> 44:11.886
Maybe I don't wanna go.

44:11.919 --> 44:13.854
What is that?

44:13.888 --> 44:17.424
That was so much fun.
Oh my gosh, do it again.

44:17.458 --> 44:19.293
No, no.
Okay, just one little spin.

44:19.326 --> 44:21.395
-See that's nice.
-Just hold on a second. Jacklyn?

44:21.428 --> 44:23.130
-No.
-On land, you guys are CEOs.

44:23.164 --> 44:25.232
-Idiot.
-But out there in the ocean,

44:25.266 --> 44:27.334
-I'm chairman of my board.
-Oh nice.

44:27.368 --> 44:30.371
What an ass hat. Not you.

44:30.404 --> 44:32.806
GEOFF:
Yeah, no shit.

44:32.840 --> 44:34.475
HARRISON:
Hey, what about you?

44:34.509 --> 44:35.976
You got anything
on your horizons

44:36.010 --> 44:37.378
I should have my radar on?

44:39.113 --> 44:41.182
-Geoff?
-Huh? Oh, no.

44:41.215 --> 44:42.449
No, nothing special.

44:42.483 --> 44:44.852
You know, it's a bunch of
stupid pitches.

44:44.885 --> 44:47.755
It's like Uber for kitty cats.

44:47.788 --> 44:51.225
It's like Door dash from my
ass. I don't know.

44:57.364 --> 44:59.366
Oh, I'm sorry.

44:59.400 --> 45:01.135
No, no, no, no. Please, please,
please, please.

45:01.168 --> 45:03.103
Please don't go,
please don't go.

45:03.137 --> 45:06.807
Just buying myself another
hour of smiling stupidly.

45:08.108 --> 45:09.243
You want a hit?

45:09.276 --> 45:12.112
No, I'm good. Thanks.

45:12.146 --> 45:15.249
You hook up with the asshole?
I mean, artist?

45:15.282 --> 45:17.117
No, I didn't.

45:17.151 --> 45:18.385
TARESSA:
I'm not judging.

45:18.419 --> 45:20.254
No, seriously, I didn't.

45:20.287 --> 45:22.223
What about the guy
with the glasses?

45:22.256 --> 45:23.857
Was it that obvious?

45:23.891 --> 45:24.858
[Taressa chuckling]

45:24.892 --> 45:26.927
I didn't see anything.

45:26.961 --> 45:30.231
You're um-
you're with the surfer guy.

45:30.264 --> 45:33.500
Yeap.
But I'm pretty much here alone.

45:34.969 --> 45:36.136
The second we
get around his friends

45:36.170 --> 45:38.005
it's like I don't even exist.

45:38.038 --> 45:40.207
I thought an older guy'd
be past all that bullshit.

45:40.241 --> 45:42.544
That's when they
summit Mt. Bullshit.

45:42.577 --> 45:44.178
-TARESSA: I know.
-Yeah.

45:44.211 --> 45:45.346
-TARESSA: Right?
-Yeah.

45:45.379 --> 45:47.848
But it's so different for us.

45:47.881 --> 45:49.517
Like, I wanna have kids.

45:50.918 --> 45:52.453
It's not like we're in our 20s.

45:52.486 --> 45:55.289
I mean I'm probably
a skosh older than you.

45:56.924 --> 46:00.227
This is gonna sound crazy,
but I work with horses

46:00.261 --> 46:02.930
and we start breeding our
marriage when they're 5

46:02.963 --> 46:05.299
and put them out to
pasture when they're 15.

46:05.332 --> 46:07.434
Which is what in human years?

46:07.468 --> 46:09.370
-TARESSA: 35.
-35.

46:09.403 --> 46:11.205
-TARESSA: I'm 31.
-Yeah.

46:11.238 --> 46:12.306
TARESSA:
I mean if he's not serious

46:12.540 --> 46:15.209
am I gonna have to
get started on another guy?

46:15.242 --> 46:16.343
God.

46:17.945 --> 46:19.547
You know what?

46:19.581 --> 46:22.283
Fuck it. Fuck it.

46:23.450 --> 46:25.352
We wait for everything
in our lives.

46:25.386 --> 46:27.488
We have to wait for them
to ask us to prom.

46:27.522 --> 46:30.057
We wait for them
to ask us to marry them.

46:30.090 --> 46:32.192
We have to wait until
they're ready to have kids.

46:32.226 --> 46:34.328
Well, I am done waiting.

46:34.361 --> 46:37.831
I am done waiting for
permission
to live my fucking life.

46:37.865 --> 46:39.166
Yeah.

46:39.199 --> 46:40.535
TARESSA: You know what?

46:40.568 --> 46:41.569
-Fuck him.
-Yeah.

46:41.802 --> 46:43.404
TARESSA:
Fuck this party,
I'm out of here.

46:43.437 --> 46:44.838
[door bell rings]

46:44.872 --> 46:45.507
MATEO:
Hi. Is this thing on?
Hi, hello.

46:45.540 --> 46:48.075
-GEOFF: Hello.
-Oh, hi.

46:48.108 --> 46:51.478
-Is it your birthday?

46:51.513 --> 46:52.580
Yeah.

46:52.614 --> 46:55.550
Ah, happy birthday.

46:55.583 --> 46:58.986
Okay. One of you bozos
got me a stripper?

46:59.019 --> 47:01.121
Come on Geoff,
you know I'm not that fool.

47:01.155 --> 47:03.357
Holy shit,
that is a shirtless chef.

47:03.390 --> 47:05.059
Wait-wait, who that?

47:05.092 --> 47:06.293
SHARON:
Who is that?

47:06.327 --> 47:08.162
He does online cooking videos.

47:08.195 --> 47:10.130
shirtless.

47:10.164 --> 47:11.932
As in zero shirt.

47:11.965 --> 47:13.300
MEERA:
I'ma subscribe.

47:13.334 --> 47:14.401
SHARON:
Yeah.

47:14.435 --> 47:15.402
You're welcome.

47:17.004 --> 47:19.239
MATEO:
You wouldn't happen
to be Jaclyn?

47:19.273 --> 47:20.374
Would you?

47:20.407 --> 47:21.543
I would.

47:21.576 --> 47:23.911
Ah, pleasure to meet you.

47:25.312 --> 47:28.449
Oh, pleasure is all mine.

47:28.482 --> 47:31.418
Amandine has told me so many
fascinating

47:31.452 --> 47:32.587
tidbits about you.

47:33.921 --> 47:35.456
Uh-huh.

47:35.489 --> 47:38.058
It's a little hot in here.

47:38.092 --> 47:39.527
I don't know why
I'm wearing this anymore.

47:39.561 --> 47:40.994
Ah, oh look, raddish.

47:43.230 --> 47:44.998
Hey, can I steal-

47:45.032 --> 47:46.166
Okay.

47:46.200 --> 47:49.403
Can I steal Jaclyn for a second?

47:49.436 --> 47:50.904
-Maybe later.
-No.

47:50.938 --> 47:52.306
It will just take a minute.

47:52.339 --> 47:54.475
I don't- Geoff, I-

47:56.143 --> 47:57.945
I'll be-

47:57.978 --> 47:59.480
I heard you quit working
for Jen Anishton.

48:01.415 --> 48:05.419
Yeah. I mean it's not totally
confirmed yet, but yeah.

48:05.452 --> 48:07.421
Okay, well, do you have
anything lined up?

48:08.989 --> 48:11.258
Not yet.
Just kind of going around

48:11.291 --> 48:13.227
trying to figure out
where I want to land.

48:13.260 --> 48:15.329
Uh-huh. Well, that's perfect.

48:15.362 --> 48:18.232
Because I have a friend
who just started a non-profit

48:18.265 --> 48:20.568
that supports educational
programs for girls

48:20.602 --> 48:21.935
in third world countries.

48:21.969 --> 48:23.036
I know.

48:23.070 --> 48:24.238
That's great. Well, listen.

48:24.271 --> 48:26.140
Why don't you give them
my contact, and I-

48:26.173 --> 48:27.474
Okay, Meera.

48:27.509 --> 48:30.210
Yeah. Hey, I want you
to meet somebody.

48:30.244 --> 48:32.179
This is-- this is Jaclyn
McGinley.

48:32.212 --> 48:34.549
-Hi.
-She just left her position

48:34.582 --> 48:37.418
as the Director of
Jen Aniston's foundation.

48:39.086 --> 48:40.320
What?

48:40.354 --> 48:41.922
Now, you guys talk.

48:43.090 --> 48:44.958
-Jen Anishton?
-Yeah.

48:44.992 --> 48:46.728
You know, I'm a huge fan.

48:46.761 --> 48:49.129
I was just at her benefit
at the Getty last month.

48:49.163 --> 48:50.431
Well did you-
Did you do that?

48:50.464 --> 48:51.965
-I did, yeah.
-You did.

48:51.999 --> 48:53.735
Oh my goodness. This is fate.

48:53.768 --> 48:54.968
Yes. Yes it is.

48:55.002 --> 48:56.571
Because, let me tell you.

48:56.604 --> 48:59.239
I was at the grocery
store yesterday,

48:59.273 --> 49:00.441
and I was checking out
the tabloids.

49:00.474 --> 49:02.476
I don't usually check out
the tabloids.

49:02.510 --> 49:04.311
But I just happen to see Jen.

49:04.344 --> 49:06.548
And they were talking about
how she's childless.

49:06.581 --> 49:09.149
And I went home to Kahlil
and I told him,

49:09.183 --> 49:10.984
"Why doesn't she just adopt?"

49:11.018 --> 49:14.221
You know? And then I meet you
here tonight.

49:14.254 --> 49:15.523
So why doesn't she adopt?

49:15.557 --> 49:16.724
[indistinct chatter in
background]

49:16.758 --> 49:18.392
Oh, I don't-

49:18.425 --> 49:19.761
We don't really talk about that.

49:19.794 --> 49:21.395
Well, would you?

49:21.428 --> 49:24.599
Would you? Because adoption is
just such a blessling.

49:24.632 --> 49:27.367
Yeah. I mean, we adopted
four of our six.

49:27.401 --> 49:29.036
One from Mozambique,
one from Peru,

49:29.069 --> 49:30.772
one from Russia
and one from China.

49:30.805 --> 49:33.173
All you need is Australian,
and you got a continental set.

49:33.207 --> 49:35.075
MEERA:
Oh my god, you're funny.

49:35.108 --> 49:36.109
Isn't she?

49:37.277 --> 49:39.480
She is very funny.

49:39.514 --> 49:41.716
Girl, you hungry? We got some
more cheese that came out.

49:41.749 --> 49:44.686
Oh, you know,
I'm lactose intolerant, so.

49:44.719 --> 49:48.121
-I bet you are.
-Yeah. So-

49:48.155 --> 49:50.491
But I was saying is that,

49:50.525 --> 49:51.793
you know, motherhood
is just a blessing.

49:51.826 --> 49:53.293
No matter how you do it.

49:54.529 --> 49:57.064
-Can I ask you something?
-MEERA: Yeah.

49:57.097 --> 49:59.534
Do you feel any difference
in the bond

49:59.567 --> 50:02.770
between your adopted children
and the biological children?

50:02.804 --> 50:04.471
Not the first time
someone's asked me that.

50:05.707 --> 50:07.274
Let me be just
completely honest.

50:07.307 --> 50:10.277
With my first two,
I thought that, you know,

50:10.310 --> 50:13.213
I don't know if I could love
another the way I did them,

50:13.247 --> 50:17.117
but when I saw Donya's face,
I just-

50:17.150 --> 50:19.754
I knew she was my child.
I don't know.

50:19.787 --> 50:22.690
Love is not really
a zero-sum game, you know?

50:22.724 --> 50:25.192
Wow, that is

50:25.225 --> 50:26.694
so sweet I wanna kill myself.

50:27.862 --> 50:29.429
-MEERA: Oh my god.
-Butter fingers.

50:29.463 --> 50:32.600
Hurry now. Ah, ah. This way.

50:33.801 --> 50:35.035
Let's go faster.

50:36.270 --> 50:38.038
Must go faster.

50:39.339 --> 50:40.240
[door closes]

50:40.274 --> 50:44.177
[♪♪]

50:44.211 --> 50:47.414
Sorry, I thought the situation
called for bit of a

50:47.447 --> 50:48.683
diversion.

50:48.716 --> 50:50.117
Yeah, thank you.

50:50.150 --> 50:51.418
Of course.

50:51.451 --> 50:54.454
So, you work in
the not-for-profit space.

50:54.488 --> 50:55.723
I admire that.

50:57.190 --> 50:59.459
Very satisfying.

50:59.493 --> 51:00.595
[Jaclyn chuckles]

51:00.628 --> 51:02.195
Are you doing that
on purpose?

51:02.229 --> 51:05.499
I'm sorry, I'm not exactly sure
what you mean.

51:05.533 --> 51:08.235
The talking like
Jeff Goldblum thing.

51:08.268 --> 51:10.805
[Jacklyn and Mateo chuckle]

51:10.838 --> 51:14.474
Well, I certainly hope
I can measure up.

51:14.509 --> 51:16.811
Oh, I think you're even better

51:16.844 --> 51:18.780
than the real thing, truly.

51:20.347 --> 51:21.583
So, you're an actor?

51:23.183 --> 51:24.284
Do you have anything
against actors?

51:24.318 --> 51:25.887
No, no, no. No.

51:25.920 --> 51:28.556
I think that's great.
You know?

51:28.590 --> 51:31.759
You're sensitive and artistic.

51:31.793 --> 51:33.561
[Jaclyn breaths heavily]

51:33.595 --> 51:34.762
Is that why

51:34.796 --> 51:38.465
you're so muscly?

51:38.498 --> 51:41.401
MATEO:
Oh, this is my instrument.

51:41.435 --> 51:44.639
JACLYN:
It is Stradivarius.

51:46.340 --> 51:47.609
[Jaclyn sighs]

51:48.810 --> 51:50.410
-A Stradivarius is-
-I know.

51:50.444 --> 51:51.613
-Oh.
-The kind of guitar

51:51.646 --> 51:52.780
Jimi Hendrix played.

51:56.383 --> 51:58.686
So, what have I seen you in?

51:58.720 --> 52:01.789
Well, I got cast
in an episode of Flash.

52:01.823 --> 52:03.925
But I wore mask so you
can't really tell it was me.

52:03.958 --> 52:05.760
I bet you were great.

52:05.793 --> 52:07.494
The fight choreographer
thought so. Yeah.

52:08.930 --> 52:11.566
I mean, it's not easy
being a Latino actor.

52:11.599 --> 52:12.600
The Goldblum thing helps out.

52:12.800 --> 52:15.502
I get to go out for
hot nerdy types now.

52:15.536 --> 52:16.938
I like hot nerdy types.

52:16.971 --> 52:19.272
Yeah, it's better than
type-cast
as a gang banger.

52:19.306 --> 52:20.908
I go like "What's up?"

52:20.942 --> 52:22.510
You know what would
be a dream role?

52:22.543 --> 52:23.945
Playing Goldblum's kid.

52:23.978 --> 52:27.214
Like, in a Jurassic sequel
or West Anderson movie.

52:27.247 --> 52:29.851
Like, the son he never knew.

52:29.884 --> 52:31.284
And I can play against type.

52:31.318 --> 52:32.820
I can play someone stupid, like-

52:32.854 --> 52:34.354
I want you to fuck me, stupid?

52:34.388 --> 52:36.824
Oh, wait.

52:36.858 --> 52:38.926
You mean like, you want me
to fuck you COMMA stupid,

52:38.960 --> 52:39.894
like, you think I'm dumb?

52:41.696 --> 52:43.430
I want you to
fuck my brains out.

52:43.463 --> 52:45.332
Oh, I see.

52:56.443 --> 52:57.578
You are hot, oh my god.

52:57.612 --> 52:58.846
JACLYN:
You're hot.

53:01.015 --> 53:04.719
Which brings me to WFTs.
Right?

53:04.752 --> 53:06.654
-Weed fungible tokens.
-Oh.

53:06.688 --> 53:09.356
REESE:
Kind of like an NFT
that you can smoke, okay?

53:09.389 --> 53:11.291
But it's also on the blockchain.

53:11.324 --> 53:14.729
Every ounce of weed you buy
or every preroll you buy-

53:14.762 --> 53:16.296
-Okay.
-Oh.

53:16.329 --> 53:17.799
This guy's out of here, now.
It's cool, it's cool.

53:17.832 --> 53:18.866
You know, some people aren't
into weed.

53:18.900 --> 53:20.400
-It's totally cool.
-Yeah.

53:20.434 --> 53:21.769
REESE:
So, it is a weed product.

53:21.803 --> 53:24.005
You get it from the-it's data?

53:24.038 --> 53:25.740
You do order it on data.

53:25.773 --> 53:27.307
[door bell rings]

53:27.340 --> 53:28.009
I'm sorry, I'll be right back.
I'll be right back.

53:28.042 --> 53:29.476
Absolutely cool.

53:30.912 --> 53:34.347
Hey dodo bird, what the heck
are you doing here?

53:34.381 --> 53:35.750
I forgot Nermie.

53:35.783 --> 53:38.853
Oh, rats!

53:38.886 --> 53:40.788
Well, where's nana?

53:40.822 --> 53:42.623
She's in the car waiting.

53:42.657 --> 53:44.726
Oh, is she? Oh, yeah.

53:44.759 --> 53:45.626
There she is.

53:45.660 --> 53:46.661
[car horn]

53:46.694 --> 53:47.762
Hey,

53:47.795 --> 53:50.230
you know
it's my birthday, right?

53:51.431 --> 53:53.000
And I get whatever
I want on my birthday,

53:53.034 --> 53:54.301
that's the rule.

53:54.334 --> 53:56.738
So, what I want

53:56.771 --> 53:59.841
is for you to get in there

53:59.874 --> 54:02.810
and eat all of your
left-over Easter candy,

54:02.844 --> 54:05.412
every single thing.

54:05.445 --> 54:06.981
Get in there!
Gobble it up.

54:08.883 --> 54:09.984
[chuckles]

54:10.017 --> 54:13.386
You can have a goodnight.
You bitch.

54:15.089 --> 54:17.024
Hey, Sophie. Hey, girl,
what are you doing?

54:17.058 --> 54:19.794
Hi, string bean. Hi.

54:19.827 --> 54:21.929
You're supposed to be
at your grandma's house.

54:21.963 --> 54:23.598
I forgot Nermie.

54:23.631 --> 54:25.600
MOLLY:
Okay.
Alright, go on up and get it.

54:25.633 --> 54:27.034
Or maybe not,

54:27.068 --> 54:29.771
because when I will be awake
passing my bedtime,

54:29.804 --> 54:33.641
I will turn into a zombie,
tripping over things.

54:33.674 --> 54:35.710
So maybe your mommy
should go up.

54:35.743 --> 54:37.545
MOLLY:
No, she can go get it.

54:37.578 --> 54:39.914
No, she can't. Um-umm.

54:42.349 --> 54:44.986
Oh. Okay, alright.

54:45.019 --> 54:46.587
Mommy will be right back.

54:46.621 --> 54:48.022
I love you so much. Okay.

54:51.058 --> 54:52.325
How's your night?

54:52.359 --> 54:53.928
-SOPHIE: Good.
-Yeah.

54:53.961 --> 54:55.596
[moaning]

54:55.630 --> 54:57.799
[toy squeaking]

54:59.600 --> 55:01.702
[moaning]

55:01.736 --> 55:04.705
[toy squeaking]

55:04.739 --> 55:06.607
MOLLY:
Ow.

55:12.780 --> 55:14.982
Oh my god, what are you doing?

55:15.016 --> 55:16.349
I'm not even here.

55:16.383 --> 55:17.752
[moaning]

55:19.153 --> 55:21.522
Oh, oh.

55:21.556 --> 55:22.857
I'm sorry,
but it sounded like

55:22.890 --> 55:24.826
you had a really good moment.

55:24.859 --> 55:26.994
Oh my god, Molly,
get out.

55:27.028 --> 55:28.328
Come on.

55:28.563 --> 55:30.698
I mean it's not like you
haven't heard me have sex

55:30.731 --> 55:32.066
lots of times.

55:32.099 --> 55:34.434
We were roommates in college
and I used to have sex

55:34.467 --> 55:36.971
all the time in the bedroom.

55:37.004 --> 55:38.072
But she was sleeping.

55:38.105 --> 55:39.472
I wasn't sleeping.

55:39.507 --> 55:41.108
Oh, see? So that's okay.

55:41.142 --> 55:44.011
Okay, okay, I'm gone.
I'm not even here.

55:44.045 --> 55:47.081
No, you guys, take your time.
I just needed this.

55:47.114 --> 55:49.016
Right look,
I can't even see you.

55:50.417 --> 55:53.521
Okay, strip the beds
when you're done.

55:56.489 --> 55:58.391
[breathing heavily]

55:58.425 --> 56:00.493
Is that good for you?

56:00.528 --> 56:01.729
Oh my god, yeah.

56:01.762 --> 56:03.998
I mean, I think
the last 10 seconds,

56:04.031 --> 56:07.568
that was the best sex
I've ever had.

56:07.602 --> 56:08.569
Ever.

56:08.603 --> 56:10.104
Thank you.

56:10.137 --> 56:12.807
Look, I know I'm not
the real Goldblum,

56:12.840 --> 56:16.677
but I really hope I made
your wish come true.

56:16.711 --> 56:18.646
You have no idea.

56:22.116 --> 56:24.151
This is so unfair.

56:24.185 --> 56:26.921
You're hell of smart,
you do charity work,

56:26.954 --> 56:29.790
and you are smoking hot,

56:29.824 --> 56:32.392
especially for someone
with stage 4 lymphoma.

56:33.628 --> 56:36.697
-What?
-It's okay. Amandine told me.

56:36.731 --> 56:39.634
And honestly, thank you.

56:39.667 --> 56:42.103
As an actor,
I don't have a ton of money

56:42.136 --> 56:44.839
and I can't give nearly
as much as I'd like to charity.

56:44.872 --> 56:46.173
I always thought of Goldblum
thing

56:46.207 --> 56:48.142
as a gimmick for parties.

56:48.175 --> 56:51.746
But knowing that my skills
could bring you

56:51.779 --> 56:53.981
joy in the end,

56:54.015 --> 56:56.817
I just- I'm deeply honored.

56:56.851 --> 56:57.952
Yeah.

57:00.955 --> 57:04.792
I hate to sound pity with
everything you're going through

57:04.825 --> 57:06.727
but you don't have any STDs,
do you?

57:08.562 --> 57:10.598
-No.
-Oh.

57:10.631 --> 57:12.199
Normally, I would use a condom.

57:12.233 --> 57:14.501
but seeing as how you're Mormon
and only have a week to live,

57:14.535 --> 57:15.970
I thought I could
take the risk.

57:18.205 --> 57:20.207
Are you strong enough
to get up on your own?

57:20.241 --> 57:21.842
You need help?

57:21.876 --> 57:24.245
I got it, thank you. Yeah.

57:24.278 --> 57:26.013
I'm just gonna take a minute.

57:27.515 --> 57:28.950
You rest.

57:28.983 --> 57:30.017
Okay.

57:31.619 --> 57:35.056
[indistinct chatter]

57:36.157 --> 57:37.992
Now I hate surfing.

57:38.025 --> 57:39.527
[door bell rings]

57:40.661 --> 57:41.829
Oh boy.

57:45.733 --> 57:47.802
Hi, happy birthday.

57:47.835 --> 57:49.502
-Welcome, thank you.
-Thank you.

57:49.537 --> 57:50.604
Thank you for having me.

57:50.638 --> 57:53.207
Oh, thank you.

57:53.240 --> 57:55.176
Is Armin-is Armin still here?

57:55.209 --> 57:56.877
Is Armin here?
Yeah, yeah, of course.

57:56.911 --> 57:58.913
And he's, you know,
had a couple.

57:58.946 --> 58:00.748
Okay, should I go, or-?

58:00.781 --> 58:02.817
No! No, no, no.
Of course, not.

58:02.850 --> 58:04.685
No, god.
You drove all the way here.

58:04.719 --> 58:06.187
I mean, please,
make yourself at home.

58:06.220 --> 58:07.788
Have something to eat,
have a drink.

58:07.822 --> 58:09.623
-It's so good to see you.
-Oh my goodness, you too.

58:09.657 --> 58:11.792
-Happy birthday. We'll talk.
-Alright. Alright.

58:13.561 --> 58:14.729
ARMIN:
Dude, is that-

58:14.762 --> 58:16.163
Hey, I'm so sorry.

58:16.197 --> 58:17.565
Oh fuck, not her.

58:17.598 --> 58:19.166
I know, I know.

58:19.200 --> 58:21.802
Molly mentioned it, I couldn't
uninvite her. Do you want me to

58:21.836 --> 58:23.304
-ask her to go?
-No, no.

58:23.337 --> 58:25.106
That makes me look
like I can't handle it.

58:25.139 --> 58:26.874
And you know, that's how
the terrorists win.

58:26.907 --> 58:27.908
So, no.

58:29.276 --> 58:30.778
Can you believe how fat she got?

58:30.811 --> 58:33.014
[Armin chuckles]
Yikes.

58:33.047 --> 58:34.815
Oh buddy, that's not fat.

58:36.884 --> 58:38.586
-She's fucking pregnant?
-Yeah, I'm so sorry.

58:38.619 --> 58:39.854
I didn't know
how to tell you that.

58:41.088 --> 58:42.656
No, it's fine, it's fine.

58:42.690 --> 58:44.058
You know what?
I'm gonna go say hi to her.

58:44.091 --> 58:45.126
No, don't say hi.

58:46.794 --> 58:50.598
Why would you say hi?
Don't say hi.

58:50.631 --> 58:51.866
Kegels are key.

58:51.899 --> 58:53.267
-Oh, yeah.
-Just keep doing that.

58:53.300 --> 58:57.238
Joyce, hey.
Fancy seeing you here.

58:57.271 --> 58:58.906
Yeah, well,
they're my friends too.

58:58.939 --> 59:01.675
Yeah, because of me.

59:01.709 --> 59:04.578
Are we really gonna do this
at your best friend's party?

59:04.612 --> 59:07.014
See, you said it.
My best friend. So.

59:08.616 --> 59:09.884
Do you want me to leave?

59:09.917 --> 59:12.686
Oh, now you care about
what I want. Hmm.

59:14.021 --> 59:16.057
No, you know what? I'm sorry.

59:16.090 --> 59:20.294
It's fine. We're grown ups.
And congratulations.

59:20.327 --> 59:22.763
I am very happy for you
and you look beautiful.

59:23.964 --> 59:25.066
-Thank you.
-Yeah.

59:25.099 --> 59:26.667
I appreciate that.

59:26.700 --> 59:28.169
I feel bloated and disgusting
but-

59:28.202 --> 59:31.372
No, it suits you.
The, huh, pregnancy.

59:31.405 --> 59:35.676
Not the-
How is Peter doing?

59:35.709 --> 59:37.011
You don't really want
to know that, do you?

59:37.044 --> 59:39.680
Not at all.
I just hope you're happy.

59:39.713 --> 59:42.683
-JOYCE: I'm very happy.
-Good. Good, good, good.

59:42.716 --> 59:43.784
JOYCE:
Yeah.

59:48.956 --> 59:50.057
Yeah.

59:50.091 --> 59:51.092
Great to see you.

59:52.226 --> 59:53.861
-Cool.
-Yeah.

59:56.997 --> 59:58.365
Make a wish?

59:58.399 --> 01:00:00.134
Is that what I am to you?
A charity case?

01:00:00.167 --> 01:00:01.735
He was already
on my original list

01:00:01.769 --> 01:00:03.137
because of the Goldblum thing.

01:00:03.170 --> 01:00:05.639
But he just got cast in a play

01:00:05.673 --> 01:00:06.941
and he was supposed
to perform tonight.

01:00:06.974 --> 01:00:09.009
I had to think of
a life-or-death reason

01:00:09.043 --> 01:00:11.412
to get him to skip it. So-

01:00:11.445 --> 01:00:12.813
-Cancer?
-That was the only way

01:00:12.847 --> 01:00:15.416
I could get him to agree to go
raw dog.

01:00:15.449 --> 01:00:18.119
Dead girls don't need condoms.

01:00:18.152 --> 01:00:19.653
But Mormon?

01:00:19.687 --> 01:00:21.322
Oh, that, you know that kind of
just slipped out.

01:00:22.790 --> 01:00:25.092
-Hey.
-Hi.

01:00:25.126 --> 01:00:27.728
You see that pregnant woman
over there?

01:00:27.761 --> 01:00:29.697
The one on the right.
That's my ex.

01:00:29.730 --> 01:00:31.832
And I'm about to say
something or do something

01:00:31.866 --> 01:00:33.834
that will get me
excommunicated or in prison.

01:00:33.868 --> 01:00:37.037
So, you know, could you
distract me or something?

01:00:39.106 --> 01:00:40.007
-Yeah.
-Yeah?

01:00:40.040 --> 01:00:41.942
-Yeah, sure.
-Okay.

01:00:43.310 --> 01:00:44.845
Okay.

01:00:47.014 --> 01:00:48.015
What's this from?

01:00:48.048 --> 01:00:50.718
Oh. Knee replacement.

01:00:50.751 --> 01:00:53.687
Warranty ran out
a couple of years ago. So-

01:00:53.721 --> 01:00:56.290
Oh, I can give you a good
referral for your mom's hip.

01:00:56.323 --> 01:00:59.059
My guy is like,
the best in the biz. So-

01:00:59.093 --> 01:01:00.461
Oh yeah, great. Thank you.

01:01:00.494 --> 01:01:01.996
Yeah.

01:01:02.029 --> 01:01:04.431
I think scars are pretty sexy.

01:01:04.465 --> 01:01:05.366
-Oh really?
-Yeah.

01:01:05.399 --> 01:01:06.734
Well, I do have another one.

01:01:06.934 --> 01:01:09.170
Yeah, right here where
Joyce ripped out my heart

01:01:09.203 --> 01:01:10.371
with her bare hands.
Do you wanna see it?

01:01:10.404 --> 01:01:12.072
-JACLYN: Wow, Joyce?
-Yeah.

01:01:12.106 --> 01:01:14.408
Oh, well, you know,

01:01:14.441 --> 01:01:16.010
it's a terrible name
for a villain.

01:01:16.043 --> 01:01:18.012
-Yeah, it really is.
-Yeah.

01:01:18.045 --> 01:01:21.815
It's even got joy in it.
How can I be mad at that?

01:01:21.849 --> 01:01:23.851
I walked in on mine
getting a BJ.

01:01:25.753 --> 01:01:28.422
Blowjobs are overrated.

01:01:28.455 --> 01:01:30.291
You're just saying that to me
to feel better.

01:01:30.324 --> 01:01:33.727
Yeah, I am.
100%, blowjobs are awesome.

01:01:33.761 --> 01:01:36.096
You know, they had the nerve
to send me a Christmas card.

01:01:36.130 --> 01:01:37.431
-What?
-Yeah.

01:01:37.464 --> 01:01:39.333
So, I drew a dick on her face
and sent it back.

01:01:39.366 --> 01:01:40.868
[Armin laughs]

01:01:40.901 --> 01:01:42.403
Nice.

01:01:42.436 --> 01:01:46.106
[indistinct chatter in
background]

01:01:48.075 --> 01:01:49.511
See that in there?

01:01:49.544 --> 01:01:51.378
Those are my friends.

01:01:52.913 --> 01:01:55.783
And she had her friends.
I just don't get it,

01:01:55.816 --> 01:01:58.786
why does she think
she needs mine? You know?

01:01:58.819 --> 01:02:01.989
I know it's pathetic,
but like, fuck, come on!

01:02:02.022 --> 01:02:04.024
No, no, I totally get it.

01:02:04.058 --> 01:02:06.528
I ran into my ex with
his beautiful new wife

01:02:06.561 --> 01:02:07.995
and their baby.

01:02:08.028 --> 01:02:09.363
The baby that he didn't
want to have with me.

01:02:09.396 --> 01:02:11.298
At my garden shop.

01:02:11.332 --> 01:02:13.234
ARMIN:
Did you shove him
into a cactus?

01:02:13.267 --> 01:02:15.135
I mean, that would have been my
go-to move just right in there.

01:02:15.169 --> 01:02:16.203
-No, but I should have.
-Yeah, you should have.

01:02:16.237 --> 01:02:18.072
Yeah.

01:02:18.105 --> 01:02:21.976
You know, my mom got divorced
at the age of 44.

01:02:22.009 --> 01:02:25.879
And I can honestly say I don't
think she's ever had sex since.

01:02:27.314 --> 01:02:29.183
I think she's hanging out
in the wrong retirement homes.

01:02:29.216 --> 01:02:30.317
-Yeah?
-I really do.

01:02:30.351 --> 01:02:32.019
[Armin and Jaclyn laughing]

01:02:34.054 --> 01:02:37.992
Thing is I don't feel
any different than I did

01:02:38.025 --> 01:02:39.393
when I was 25.

01:02:39.426 --> 01:02:42.129
Yeah, same. It's crazy.

01:02:42.162 --> 01:02:43.998
I went to see
this band last week,

01:02:44.031 --> 01:02:45.499
and I swear to you,

01:02:45.533 --> 01:02:49.503
I raised the average age of
that room by at least 10 years.

01:02:49.537 --> 01:02:51.171
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

01:02:51.205 --> 01:02:54.942
And I caught the eye of
this woman and I smiled at her,

01:02:54.975 --> 01:02:56.410
and she looked me
like I was a pedophile.

01:02:56.443 --> 01:02:58.145
Okay, but in her defense-

01:02:58.178 --> 01:02:59.346
-What?
-You just-

01:02:59.380 --> 01:03:03.050
wait, guys at clubs are creepy.

01:03:03.083 --> 01:03:06.186
They are. I mean, I go dancing
and I swear

01:03:06.220 --> 01:03:08.255
every single guy in there is
looking at me like I'm in heat.

01:03:09.456 --> 01:03:13.093
Why can't a girl just look fly
and go dancing, you know?

01:03:13.127 --> 01:03:14.295
I hate to break it to you but

01:03:14.328 --> 01:03:17.131
dancing has
always been about sex.

01:03:17.164 --> 01:03:18.365
Yeah. I mean, I saw this
National Geographic video.

01:03:18.399 --> 01:03:19.601
Are you flirting with me?

01:03:19.634 --> 01:03:22.102
[Armin laughing]

This is weed fungible tokens.
It's an investment.

01:13:07.755 --> 01:13:08.723
JACLYN:
Hey.

01:13:10.725 --> 01:13:12.760
Geoff won't have sex with me.

01:13:14.528 --> 01:13:17.965
I don't think his birthday
party is the best time to do it.

01:13:17.999 --> 01:13:19.499
You know?

01:13:19.533 --> 01:13:21.736
We barely even
have sex anymore ever.

01:13:21.769 --> 01:13:23.938
Honey, you guys have been
married a long time.

01:13:25.172 --> 01:13:27.440
You know, at the end
for Todd and I,

01:13:27.474 --> 01:13:30.211
we had sex maybe like,

01:13:30.244 --> 01:13:31.946
twice a month.

01:13:31.979 --> 01:13:34.115
Yeah, but you were unhappy.

01:13:34.148 --> 01:13:35.216
When we started dating,

01:13:35.249 --> 01:13:37.618
we had sex two times a night.

01:13:37.652 --> 01:13:40.721
We just recently went
on a romantic spa getaway

01:13:40.755 --> 01:13:42.657
and we had sex one time

01:13:42.690 --> 01:13:44.792
in three nights.

01:13:44.825 --> 01:13:46.227
Maybe men slow down
as they age.

01:13:46.260 --> 01:13:49.830
No, that's what I wanted.

01:13:49.864 --> 01:13:51.464
That's not me.

01:13:53.200 --> 01:13:56.637
Well, this definitely is you.

01:13:56.671 --> 01:13:58.773
I mean, this reminds me of
some of the fun times we had

01:13:58.806 --> 01:14:00.007
in senior year.

01:14:00.041 --> 01:14:02.877
Right?
Because I used to be fun.

01:14:02.910 --> 01:14:05.079
Like, I was fun, right?

01:14:05.112 --> 01:14:08.115
But I'm not any fun anymore.

01:14:08.149 --> 01:14:09.083
-Yes, you are.
-MOLLY: I'm not.

01:14:09.116 --> 01:14:10.618
I'm not even a fun mom.

01:14:10.651 --> 01:14:12.186
I thought I'd be a cool mom.
But I'm not.

01:14:12.219 --> 01:14:14.588
I yell.
I yell at my kids.

01:14:14.622 --> 01:14:15.823
I do it, I do.

01:14:15.856 --> 01:14:16.958
Everybody does.

01:14:18.526 --> 01:14:19.894
Come here, come here.

01:14:21.963 --> 01:14:23.931
I almost had sex with Tim.

01:14:23.965 --> 01:14:25.099
JACLYN:
What?

01:14:25.132 --> 01:14:26.233
I really wanted to.

01:14:26.267 --> 01:14:28.769
Molly, he's the worst.

01:14:28.803 --> 01:14:30.805
And it's your fault
that I didn't do it.

01:14:30.838 --> 01:14:32.840
I just was thinking
about you and Todd,

01:14:32.873 --> 01:14:34.909
and I didn't want
to break my marriage.

01:14:34.942 --> 01:14:36.243
I love Geoff.
I love him.

01:14:36.277 --> 01:14:37.878
He's a good man.

01:14:39.547 --> 01:14:43.017
I'm so bored.
I'm like, so, so bored.

01:14:43.050 --> 01:14:45.987
And I just-
I hate my new friends.

01:14:46.020 --> 01:14:49.256
Because I- No, no, no.
I don't-I don't hate them.

01:14:49.290 --> 01:14:51.192
I just-

01:14:51.225 --> 01:14:54.061
I do hate me when I'm with them.

01:14:54.095 --> 01:14:56.831
I fucking hate all of it.

01:14:56.864 --> 01:14:59.066
Like, I hate dance try outs.

01:14:59.100 --> 01:15:01.168
And I hate room moms.

01:15:01.202 --> 01:15:04.605
"Oh, please upload a photos
of your sweet little angels

01:15:04.638 --> 01:15:06.841
into the Shutterfly site."

01:15:06.874 --> 01:15:08.542
Why didn't you
upload any photos?

01:15:08.576 --> 01:15:10.077
You forgot to upload
the photos.

01:15:10.111 --> 01:15:11.545
Could you just do that please?

01:15:11.579 --> 01:15:13.147
Could you please do that?"

01:15:13.180 --> 01:15:14.615
Jackie, don't be a mom.

01:15:18.052 --> 01:15:20.788
I'm sorry,
I shouldn't have said that.

01:15:20.821 --> 01:15:23.758
But you won't be fun anymore
because I'm not fun anymore.

01:15:23.791 --> 01:15:25.659
And I'm never gonna see you.

01:15:25.693 --> 01:15:28.295
When do you even see me?
I'm like your best friend.

01:15:28.329 --> 01:15:31.565
Wait. Am I even your
best friend anymore?

01:15:31.599 --> 01:15:32.666
Of course, you are.

01:15:32.700 --> 01:15:34.702
[Jaclyn chuckles]

01:15:34.735 --> 01:15:37.905
Molly, come on.
Sisters before misters.

01:15:37.938 --> 01:15:39.273
I love you.

01:15:39.306 --> 01:15:40.674
I love you.

01:15:46.714 --> 01:15:48.682
Also, why am I in the pool?

01:15:48.716 --> 01:15:50.785
I don't know.

01:15:50.818 --> 01:15:52.953
Maybe I thought
everybody would get in.

01:15:52.987 --> 01:15:56.357
Yeah. Maybe it'll be a good
idea for you to get out

01:15:56.390 --> 01:15:57.958
and do the cake.

01:15:57.992 --> 01:15:59.927
Oh no, the cake.

01:15:59.960 --> 01:16:03.264
Oh no, it's Geoff's birthday.
I ruined Geoff's birthday.

01:16:03.297 --> 01:16:06.333
No, no, no.
I think I have you beat there.

01:16:06.367 --> 01:16:07.902
It's true.

01:16:09.236 --> 01:16:10.805
It's probably true.

01:16:10.838 --> 01:16:11.872
JACLYN:
Alright, okay.

01:16:11.906 --> 01:16:12.773
MOLLY:
You know, I love you.

01:16:12.807 --> 01:16:14.708
I love you too.

01:16:14.742 --> 01:16:17.211
Can I-
Can I borrow you for a sec.

01:16:17.244 --> 01:16:18.813
I'm just helping Molly
with the cake.

01:16:18.846 --> 01:16:20.648
Yeah, it'll be great.

01:16:20.681 --> 01:16:21.816
It's okay.

01:16:21.849 --> 01:16:23.250
I'll be right back. Okay.

01:16:33.894 --> 01:16:37.198
Cake, frosting.
I'm coming for you candles.

01:16:38.732 --> 01:16:40.334
Joyce, hey.

01:16:40.367 --> 01:16:43.971
I just wanted to introduce you
to my girlfriend, Jaclyn.

01:16:44.004 --> 01:16:46.941
Huh. How convenient.

01:16:46.974 --> 01:16:48.809
It's a pleasure to meet you.

01:16:48.843 --> 01:16:50.978
How long have you two
been together?

01:16:51.011 --> 01:16:54.014
We're not actually
"dating" dating.

01:16:54.048 --> 01:16:56.183
Yeah, but it seems promising.

01:16:56.217 --> 01:16:58.018
You know, just nice
to be with someone

01:16:58.052 --> 01:16:59.920
who doesn't play games.

01:16:59.954 --> 01:17:03.824
Oh, yeah. I get that.
I do adore games.

01:17:03.858 --> 01:17:05.326
Probably because
I enjoy the company

01:17:05.359 --> 01:17:06.961
-of other human beings.
-A lot, yeah.

01:17:06.994 --> 01:17:08.696
I shouldn't be in the middle.

01:17:08.729 --> 01:17:10.931
Is everything alright over here?
Are these people bothering you?

01:17:10.965 --> 01:17:12.833
Who the fuck is this guy?

01:17:12.867 --> 01:17:14.401
-Uh, he-
-Wait a minute. I know you.

01:17:14.435 --> 01:17:16.103
Are you the shirtless chef?

01:17:16.137 --> 01:17:17.771
Oh my god, I love your
brined chicken breasts.

01:17:17.805 --> 01:17:19.006
They're so good.

01:17:19.039 --> 01:17:20.941
It's the smoked paprika
and pineapple juice

01:17:20.975 --> 01:17:22.409
that makes it boom.

01:17:22.443 --> 01:17:23.978
JOYCE:
Do you drink
a lot of pineapple juice?

01:17:24.011 --> 01:17:25.146
-MATEO: Tons.
-MEERA: Ah,

01:17:25.179 --> 01:17:26.280
it's got that sweet sauce?

01:17:26.313 --> 01:17:28.115
JOYCE:
Yeah, it's got that sweet sauce.

01:17:28.149 --> 01:17:29.884
Okay, what is going on here?

01:17:29.917 --> 01:17:32.987
Just talking to people
at a party I was invited to.

01:17:33.020 --> 01:17:34.021

Hi, it's me MJ
from the bathroom.

I know it's not Jeff Goldblum,
but it is a dinosaur

and they're apex predators
and you're the apex predator

Hey yo, before you leave,

01:17:47.968 --> 01:17:49.436
we're gonna have
a little survey.

01:17:49.470 --> 01:17:52.973
Show hands who here
has not had sex

01:17:53.007 --> 01:17:54.375
with Jaclyn tonight.

01:17:54.408 --> 01:17:56.310

One, two, three, four, five.

01:17:59.413 --> 01:18:01.048
It's more than
I would have thought.

01:18:01.081 --> 01:18:03.117
Did you have a gang bang
at my birthday party?

01:18:03.150 --> 01:18:04.418
No. No.

01:18:04.451 --> 01:18:07.054
Okay, whoa,
you're slut shaming her.

01:18:07.087 --> 01:18:08.923
No, it's truth telling.

01:18:08.956 --> 01:18:11.025
She fucked four guys
at my house.

01:18:11.058 --> 01:18:13.827
Oh my god.
When you went upstairs.

01:18:13.861 --> 01:18:16.197
Please tell me that you
did not have sex in my bed.

No, I didn't.

I didn't have sex with.

chef? Lucky.

okay, I get it.

01:20:51.151 --> 01:20:51.985
-JACLYN: The party's over.
-AMANDINE: What do you mean

01:20:52.019 --> 01:20:53.887
the party's over? Oh.

01:20:55.923 --> 01:20:57.925
Enjoy your walk of shame, slut.

01:20:57.958 --> 01:21:05.533
[♪♪]

01:21:05.567 --> 01:21:08.102
I knew you'd come back for me.

01:21:08.135 --> 01:21:11.905
Listen, you misogynistic
untalented nut sack,

01:21:11.939 --> 01:21:13.273
if I'm really such a slut,

01:21:13.307 --> 01:21:14.975
then why didn't I
sleep with you?

01:21:15.008 --> 01:21:17.244
And also, fuck you
for calling me a slut.

01:21:17.277 --> 01:21:20.347
I can sleep with whoever I want
and however many people I want.

01:21:20.381 --> 01:21:23.518
Just because you didn't get
laid
doesn't make me the bad guy.

01:21:23.551 --> 01:21:26.688
And actually, it was deliberate
choice not to sleep with you

01:21:26.721 --> 01:21:30.224
because the very thought of
a miniature you make me sick.

01:21:30.257 --> 01:21:32.292
Wow, why would there
be miniature me?

01:21:32.326 --> 01:21:33.494
[Tim laughing]

01:21:35.530 --> 01:21:38.198
Because you were all selected

01:21:38.232 --> 01:21:40.602
for a very special purpose.

01:21:40.635 --> 01:21:42.570
I gotta say, it's beautiful.

01:21:42.604 --> 01:21:45.105
Is this a Mormon thing?
Like, you're sister wives?

01:21:45.139 --> 01:21:46.574
Wait a minute.
Is this a key party?

01:21:46.608 --> 01:21:48.208
Oh my god, is this a coven?

01:21:48.242 --> 01:21:50.444
Where the fuck are my-
Never mind, I got it.

01:21:50.477 --> 01:21:52.212
You told me the condom broke.

01:21:52.246 --> 01:21:54.348
It did. It did technically.

01:21:54.381 --> 01:21:56.183
You know, I just- I might have
helped it a little bit.

01:21:56.216 --> 01:21:59.587
Girl, this is deceivious.
I like it.

01:21:59.621 --> 01:22:01.255
She wants a baby.

01:22:01.288 --> 01:22:04.992
So, one of you lucky guys
is gonna be a baby daddy. Yay.

01:22:07.060 --> 01:22:09.531
And who wants cake?

01:22:09.564 --> 01:22:11.465
Well, at least I know
it's not mine.

01:22:11.498 --> 01:22:13.701
I pulled out.

01:22:13.735 --> 01:22:15.302
Umm.

01:22:15.335 --> 01:22:18.238
-How?
-Life finds a way.

01:22:18.272 --> 01:22:19.541
Okay, so which one was I?

01:22:21.341 --> 01:22:24.044
Oh god, I after-
I'm gonna be sick.

01:22:24.077 --> 01:22:25.245
Yeah, I want a DNA test.

01:22:25.279 --> 01:22:26.648
Yeah, I feel really used
right now.

01:22:26.681 --> 01:22:28.315
Like, I'm losing money
coming here.

01:22:28.348 --> 01:22:29.983
I didn't eat carbs.

01:22:30.017 --> 01:22:33.053
Bottomline is, none of these
men
gave their consent.

01:22:33.086 --> 01:22:34.556
What you did is fraud.

01:22:34.589 --> 01:22:37.424
Well, it's only fraud If she
tricked them into having sex.

01:22:37.458 --> 01:22:40.294
I mean, look at her.
I say they hit the jackpot.

01:22:40.327 --> 01:22:41.529
Thank you. Stop fucking whining.

01:22:41.563 --> 01:22:42.697
I know y'all wanted
to get a piece of

01:22:42.730 --> 01:22:44.732
Jackie's McGinley's Vaginley.

01:22:44.766 --> 01:22:46.467
This was just supposed
to be a one-time thing.

01:22:46.500 --> 01:22:48.469
I'm probably gonna plan B
the whole thing anyway.

01:22:48.502 --> 01:22:49.537
Oh, no, no. Don't do that.

01:22:49.571 --> 01:22:53.040
[indistinct chatter]

01:22:53.073 --> 01:22:55.375
Each and every one of you
are good and decent men.

01:22:55.409 --> 01:22:56.678
Except you.

01:22:56.711 --> 01:22:59.146
And I'm so sorry for lying.

01:22:59.179 --> 01:23:02.382
But I had a really good time.

01:23:02.416 --> 01:23:03.718
But if we met in real life,
okay?

01:23:03.751 --> 01:23:06.386
On a real date.
Who would you pick?

01:23:06.420 --> 01:23:10.123
Because if it were up to me,
I would pick you in a heartbeat.

01:23:10.157 --> 01:23:13.093
Oh, that is really thoughtful

01:23:13.126 --> 01:23:14.662
and amazing to hear.

01:23:16.063 --> 01:23:18.465
Okay. Well, that settles it.

01:23:18.499 --> 01:23:19.634
Oh my god.

01:23:19.667 --> 01:23:21.435
Huh.

01:23:21.468 --> 01:23:23.036
UNKNOWN SPEAKER:
Get up, man. Get up.
Jaclyn, will you marry me?

01:23:23.070 --> 01:23:24.572
-No.
-I don't want our baby to

01:23:24.606 --> 01:23:26.039
enter the world a bastard.

01:23:26.073 --> 01:23:28.141
Yeah, that bastard
could be my kid.

01:23:28.175 --> 01:23:29.476
Huh, let's hope not.

01:23:29.511 --> 01:23:30.645
BARBARA:
Points for creativity.

01:23:30.678 --> 01:23:33.280
But legal or not,
this plan is insane.

01:23:33.313 --> 01:23:36.083
Yes, you're right.
It is insane.

01:23:36.116 --> 01:23:37.417
I didn't want to get
pregnant this way.

01:23:37.451 --> 01:23:39.554
I really didn't.
I would love

01:23:39.587 --> 01:23:41.823
to have a baby with a loving
husband.

01:23:41.856 --> 01:23:44.726
And yes, I could adopt
and I could go to a sperm bank.

01:23:44.759 --> 01:23:47.094
But I want to know
who the father is.

01:23:47.127 --> 01:23:49.196
Because one day,
I can look at my child

01:23:49.229 --> 01:23:52.834
and I can say, "Your father
was a kind and decent man."

01:23:52.867 --> 01:23:55.068
And they don't have an app
for that.

01:23:55.102 --> 01:23:56.169
-Oh my god.
-Hmm.

01:23:56.203 --> 01:23:57.104
JACLYN:
I came up with this crazy...

01:23:57.137 --> 01:23:58.238
You think what I'm thinking?

01:23:58.272 --> 01:23:59.574
I can get a prototype up in a
month.

01:23:59.607 --> 01:24:01.576
JACKLYN:
...selfish and a horrible
person.

01:24:01.609 --> 01:24:03.243
And I'm sorry.

01:24:03.277 --> 01:24:06.848
I just wanted to have a baby of
my own. If I still could.

01:24:06.881 --> 01:24:10.250
MATEO:
I mean, god. When you put it
like that, I just-it's-

01:24:10.284 --> 01:24:11.586
Are you insane?

01:24:11.619 --> 01:24:13.153
Are you insane?

01:24:13.186 --> 01:24:14.622
Have you all people
lost your minds?

01:24:15.790 --> 01:24:18.626
This- this woman stole
your sperm.

01:24:19.827 --> 01:24:22.429
She stole your sperm, man.

01:24:22.462 --> 01:24:25.499
She stole your sperm.
She stole your sperm.

01:24:25.533 --> 01:24:26.668
She's a sperm burglar.

01:24:26.701 --> 01:24:28.135
-What?
-Yeah.

01:24:28.168 --> 01:24:29.303
You ask me,

01:24:30.738 --> 01:24:33.508
your ex got off the crazy train

01:24:33.541 --> 01:24:34.542
just in the nick of time.

01:24:35.610 --> 01:24:36.744
Oh!

01:24:38.278 --> 01:24:39.547
God dammit.

01:24:39.581 --> 01:24:40.582
I wanted to do that.

01:24:42.282 --> 01:24:44.619
SHARON:
Oh my god. My water just broke.

01:24:44.652 --> 01:24:45.620
-Oh no!
-SHARON: Is that all

01:24:45.920 --> 01:24:48.221
-coming from me?
-Baby you're water boarding him.

01:24:48.255 --> 01:24:50.892
-Oh my god.
-It's in my mouth.

01:24:50.925 --> 01:24:53.460
-Salty Brian.
-I think that's gonna stain.

01:24:53.493 --> 01:24:55.897
Oh my god. You have to take me
to the hospital like, now.

01:24:55.930 --> 01:24:58.533
Baby, I'm three tumblers deep
into this scotch here.

01:24:58.566 --> 01:24:59.801
Well, what are you gonna do,
ding-dong?

01:24:59.834 --> 01:25:02.202
I can take you. I can take you.
I got this.

01:25:02.235 --> 01:25:03.236
[Tim screaming]

01:25:04.906 --> 01:25:07.742
[Sharon grunting]

01:25:07.775 --> 01:25:10.210
Isn't there a breathing thing
you could be doing right now?

01:25:10.243 --> 01:25:13.581
Yeah, right. Remember baby,

01:25:13.615 --> 01:25:17.284
-hee-hee-hoooo, hee-hee-hoooo.
-Okay, hee-hee-hoo.

01:25:17.317 --> 01:25:20.855
Fuck you.
I wanna push, it's coming.

01:25:20.888 --> 01:25:22.590
No pushing in the car.

01:25:22.624 --> 01:25:24.358
Jaclyn, we're close, right?

01:25:24.391 --> 01:25:26.293
Yeah, yeah.
Minutes away, minutes away.

01:25:26.326 --> 01:25:27.662
MOLLY:
Oh look, look,
put this here.

01:25:27.695 --> 01:25:29.262
You can put that right under
there.

01:25:29.296 --> 01:25:30.765
Squeeze your legs together
real tight.

01:25:30.798 --> 01:25:32.432
Because it's real leather.

01:25:32.466 --> 01:25:34.836
It's real leather.
We paid for this nice leather.

01:25:34.869 --> 01:25:36.804
[indistinct chatter]

01:25:41.643 --> 01:25:42.844
MOLLY:
Get out of the car.

01:25:42.877 --> 01:25:45.445
Get out of the car.
Get out of the car.

01:25:45.479 --> 01:25:46.514
Get out of the car.

01:25:48.348 --> 01:25:49.449
[Sharon sobbing]

01:25:49.483 --> 01:25:50.150
Wait, what's up?

01:25:51.519 --> 01:25:54.287
My dad was a piece of shit
who was never around.

01:25:54.321 --> 01:25:56.858
[grunting]

01:25:56.891 --> 01:25:59.794
You have to promise me
you're not gonna be like that.

01:25:59.827 --> 01:26:02.764
I'm never gonna leave you.
Ever.

01:26:03.931 --> 01:26:05.867
Okay? I know you're scared.

01:26:05.900 --> 01:26:08.402
I'm scared too,
but we're a team, okay?

01:26:08.435 --> 01:26:10.504
It's you and me
versus everybody.

01:26:10.538 --> 01:26:11.572
-SHARON: Okay.
-Okay?

01:26:11.606 --> 01:26:12.807
-Okay.
-Okay?

01:26:12.840 --> 01:26:14.509
-Yeah, yeah.
-You ready to meet our daughter?

01:26:14.542 --> 01:26:15.610
-Yes.
-Come on.

01:26:15.643 --> 01:26:17.578
-Yeah, yeah.
-Let's do it. Let's go.

01:26:17.612 --> 01:26:20.414
-Here's a wheelchair.
-SHARON: Oh god.

01:26:20.447 --> 01:26:21.415
HARRISON:
Easy.

01:26:23.685 --> 01:26:25.787
Okay, now you can push.

01:26:25.820 --> 01:26:28.288
[Sharon screaming]

01:26:28.321 --> 01:26:31.391
AMANDINE:
Hee-hee-hoooo, hee-hee-hoooo.

01:26:31.425 --> 01:26:32.760
Hee-hee-hooo.

01:26:32.794 --> 01:26:34.461
[Molly laughs]

01:26:34.494 --> 01:26:35.930
Crazy.

01:26:35.963 --> 01:26:38.331
[Molly laughs]

01:26:38.365 --> 01:26:40.200
There isn't gonna be
anyone there for me.

01:26:41.468 --> 01:26:44.839
-MOLLY: No.
-I'm gonna be all alone.

01:26:44.872 --> 01:26:48.408
I've got no one by my side,
no one to hold my hand.

01:26:48.442 --> 01:26:50.444
Oh my god.
What have I done?

01:26:50.477 --> 01:26:51.779
I've just been-

01:26:51.813 --> 01:26:54.281
I've just been so focused on
getting pregnant

01:26:54.314 --> 01:26:57.752
that I didn't even think about
how I was gonna raise the kid.

01:26:57.785 --> 01:27:01.823
I mean, why would I choose
to be a single mom?

01:27:01.856 --> 01:27:03.390
This is crazy.

01:27:03.423 --> 01:27:04.826
This is something we
should have thought about

01:27:04.859 --> 01:27:06.728
like, three hours ago.

01:27:06.761 --> 01:27:08.863
Hold up.
I was raised by a single mother.

01:27:08.896 --> 01:27:10.665
-And I'm the shit.
-Yes.

01:27:10.698 --> 01:27:13.000
I don't know that I'm
gonna be a good mom.

01:27:13.034 --> 01:27:15.368
Hey, I do. I know you're gonna
be a good mom.

01:27:15.402 --> 01:27:17.304
-Yes.
-No, you don't know that.

01:27:17.337 --> 01:27:18.506
-I do.
-No, you don't.

01:27:18.539 --> 01:27:20.373
Forget about all the therapy

01:27:20.407 --> 01:27:21.542
that the kid is going to
have to have

01:27:21.576 --> 01:27:24.444
after he finds out
how I got pregnant.

01:27:24.478 --> 01:27:26.647
I mean Goeff and I,
we always saw it's a good day

01:27:26.681 --> 01:27:29.784
if we only added 15 minutes
to our kids' therapy.

01:27:29.817 --> 01:27:31.786
Yeah, but you guys
have each other.

01:27:31.819 --> 01:27:35.489
I've just got myself.
And I'm no picnic, guys.

01:27:35.523 --> 01:27:38.526
You know that.
I mean, what if I ruin this kid?

01:27:38.559 --> 01:27:40.561
I won't let you.
You need to tap out.

01:27:40.595 --> 01:27:41.662
I'm there, boom.

01:27:41.696 --> 01:27:42.864
Yeah, me too.

01:27:42.897 --> 01:27:44.397
If you need to tap out,

01:27:44.431 --> 01:27:47.501
I'm totally gonna pay
for a babysitter for you.

01:27:47.535 --> 01:27:48.435
[Jaclyn chuckles]

01:27:49.537 --> 01:27:52.073
Y'all like the straight white
sisters I never had.

01:27:52.106 --> 01:27:53.674
Are you serious?

01:27:53.708 --> 01:27:55.610
[Jaclyn chuckles]

01:27:55.643 --> 01:27:56.978
I love you guys so much.

01:27:57.011 --> 01:27:58.746
MOLLY:
I love you.

01:27:58.780 --> 01:28:01.849
Ladies, this zone is for
loading and unloading only.

01:28:01.883 --> 01:28:03.383
-Okay, just a minute.
-GUARD: I'm gonna need you to

01:28:03.416 --> 01:28:05.052
move your car or I'll have
to impound your vehicle.

01:28:09.590 --> 01:28:11.092
-Okay.
-Okay.

01:28:11.125 --> 01:28:12.693
Take me home

01:28:12.727 --> 01:28:14.796
so I can give the birthday boy
the ride of his life.

01:28:14.829 --> 01:28:16.964
Because he has definitely
earned it.

01:28:16.998 --> 01:28:18.465
-Yes.
-And I'm gonna go sit on

01:28:18.498 --> 01:28:19.466

Shirtless chef today, we're
risking it to win a biscuit.

01:30:25.559 --> 01:30:28.062
We're making a pinapple chicken
breast brine.

01:30:28.095 --> 01:30:29.931
Let's see how it turns out,
we've never done this before.

01:30:29.964 --> 01:30:30.998
Boom!

01:30:31.032 --> 01:30:33.534
One pound organic chicken
breast,

01:30:33.567 --> 01:30:35.136
one cup pineapple juice,

01:30:35.169 --> 01:30:38.572
table spoon of salt and mix it.

01:30:38.606 --> 01:30:40.608
Mix garlic,

01:30:40.641 --> 01:30:42.475
table spoon smoked peprica.

01:30:42.510 --> 01:30:43.978
Brine for two hours.

01:30:45.613 --> 01:30:48.549
Stir both sides with a little
avocado oil.

01:30:48.582 --> 01:30:50.718
Bake at 450 for 20
to 25 minutes.

01:30:50.751 --> 01:30:52.253
Work out while you wait.

01:30:52.286 --> 01:30:54.487
Boom! Boom!

01:30:55.923 --> 01:30:58.491
Delicious.
We just invented a new recipe.

01:30:58.526 --> 01:31:00.628
Boom! That's shirtless kitchen
