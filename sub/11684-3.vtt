WEBVTT

00:00.344 --> 00:01.702
My name
is Michael Westen.

00:01.771 --> 00:04.285
I used to be
a spy until...

00:04.286 --> 00:05.354
We got a burn notice on you.

00:05.421 --> 00:07.282
You're blacklisted.

00:07.350 --> 00:09.617
When you're burned,
you've got nothing.

00:09.684 --> 00:11.915
No cash, no credit,
no job history.

00:11.982 --> 00:14.257
You're stuck in whatever city
they decide to dump you in.

00:14.325 --> 00:16.689
- Where am I?
- Miami.

00:16.757 --> 00:19.026
You do whatever work
comes your way.

00:19.094 --> 00:21.197
You rely on anyone
who's still talking to you...

00:22.733 --> 00:23.666
A trigger-happy girlfriend...

00:23.733 --> 00:25.100
Should we shoot them?

00:25.168 --> 00:27.002
An old friend who used
to inform on you to the FBI...

00:27.069 --> 00:28.336
You know spies--

00:28.404 --> 00:29.706
bunch of bitchy little girls.

00:29.773 --> 00:31.109
Family too...

00:31.177 --> 00:32.009
Hey, is that your mom again?

00:32.077 --> 00:33.177
If you're desperate.

00:33.245 --> 00:34.525
Someone needs your help,
Michael.

00:34.547 --> 00:37.217
And a down-and-out spy
you met along the way.

00:37.285 --> 00:38.852
That's how we do it, people.

00:38.920 --> 00:41.592
Bottom line,
as long as you're burned,

00:41.660 --> 00:43.495
you're not going anywhere.

00:45.765 --> 00:47.199
This is the only offer
you will get.

00:47.266 --> 00:48.969
We're going after the leader
of a terrorist network

00:49.037 --> 00:50.905
based in
the Dominican Republic.

00:50.973 --> 00:52.640
- Burke.
- I got a job coming up.

00:52.707 --> 00:56.312
I was hoping you might
be right for it.

00:56.379 --> 00:57.947
I'll be in touch,
but I want you to keep

00:58.015 --> 00:59.382
a low profile
until I get back.

00:59.450 --> 01:00.750
And be ready.

01:00.818 --> 01:04.221
Michael Westen was
still working for the CIA.

01:04.289 --> 01:06.390
You are going to put me
in touch with him.

01:06.457 --> 01:10.761
Fi, it's time to be brave,
little angel.

01:28.880 --> 01:30.782
For spies, the hardest part
of operating

01:30.850 --> 01:32.383
in the field
isn't combat.

01:32.451 --> 01:33.651
When bullets are flying,

01:33.719 --> 01:36.020
there's never really time
to think.

01:36.087 --> 01:38.188
But in the quiet hours,
when you're alone,

01:38.256 --> 01:42.060
thinking
is all you can do.

01:48.936 --> 01:50.971
Spies don't make a habit
of holding on to keepsakes

01:51.038 --> 01:52.005
for the same reason
prisoners

01:52.073 --> 01:53.474
serving life sentences

01:53.541 --> 01:57.345
stop seeing visitors.

01:57.413 --> 01:59.773
As much as you might want that
connection to your past life,

01:59.816 --> 02:01.536
there comes a point
when a constant reminder

02:01.551 --> 02:04.454
of what you can never have
is just too painful.

02:08.226 --> 02:10.060
And you can't have
distractions like that

02:10.127 --> 02:12.129
when you have to focus
on a job.

02:29.083 --> 02:31.418
Whoa, that's a good look.

02:31.485 --> 02:32.853
Beard get too hot?

02:32.920 --> 02:34.855
Well, I figure
whatever the next job is,

02:34.922 --> 02:38.058
I shouldn't look like
the guy on the news.

02:38.126 --> 02:39.593
Speaking of,
what is the next job?

02:39.661 --> 02:42.196
We're gonna steal
a truck.

02:42.264 --> 02:44.231
- And the truck's in the bar?
- No.

02:44.299 --> 02:46.434
The gentleman
who's going to help us is.

02:46.502 --> 02:49.204
A local guy I've used before.
He's got his own crew.

02:49.272 --> 02:51.406
If you need a crew,
I have two guys in Miami.

02:51.474 --> 02:54.009
No, that's all right,
thanks.

02:54.077 --> 02:57.280
Let's do it this way.

02:59.750 --> 03:01.084
Mechoso.

03:01.152 --> 03:02.652
Hey,<i>Â¿que pasa?</i>

03:02.720 --> 03:04.221
<i>Bien, bien.</i>

03:06.524 --> 03:07.958
Who's he?

03:08.026 --> 03:10.394
He's just a guy
standing by a table.

03:10.462 --> 03:12.497
So you and your boys,

03:12.565 --> 03:14.265
you can do this job?

03:14.333 --> 03:15.534
I took a look.

03:15.601 --> 03:17.035
We crash the gate,
we hit it hard.

03:17.103 --> 03:18.303
It's no problem.
Okay.

03:18.371 --> 03:21.006
But I do want to discuss
one thing--

03:21.073 --> 03:23.642
my price,
it just went up.

03:23.709 --> 03:24.876
- Did it?
- Yeah.

03:24.944 --> 03:28.314
'Cause I did some,
uh, how do you say?

03:28.381 --> 03:30.116
Research.

03:30.183 --> 03:32.418
That truck
you want to steal,

03:32.486 --> 03:35.588
it belongs to that company
that's all over the news,

03:35.656 --> 03:37.757
the one with the building
that just blew up.

03:37.825 --> 03:39.125
That's none of your business,
Mechoso.

03:39.193 --> 03:40.593
Well, I made it
my business.

03:40.661 --> 03:42.929
I hear they lost a bunch
of satellite computer stuff.

03:42.997 --> 03:44.931
$25 million worth.

03:46.968 --> 03:48.902
You blow up the computers,

03:48.970 --> 03:52.306
they gotta bring in new ones
on a truck,

03:52.374 --> 03:54.776
and you hire Mechoso to steal
the truck--that about right?

03:54.843 --> 03:57.545
Ah.

03:57.613 --> 03:59.414
You got me.

03:59.482 --> 04:01.216
Smart plan, amigo.

04:01.283 --> 04:03.952
- Well, you know, yeah.
- Mm.

04:04.019 --> 04:06.488
But it's not gonna
cost you no $5,000.

04:06.555 --> 04:07.923
No.

04:07.990 --> 04:10.258
It's going to be
12.5 million.

04:10.326 --> 04:11.726
Hmm.

04:11.794 --> 04:13.928
I'm only gonna tell you this
one time.

04:13.996 --> 04:16.231
Okay.

04:16.298 --> 04:17.699
You don't want
to do this.

04:17.767 --> 04:19.968
I think I do.

04:21.737 --> 04:24.639
Or maybe I make my dinero
another way.

04:24.707 --> 04:27.376
There are people who'd pay
to know what I know.

04:27.444 --> 04:30.579
A lot more
than you're offering.

04:36.552 --> 04:40.955
Mechoso, you know me.

04:41.022 --> 04:42.990
You know
I'm a reasonable man.

04:43.058 --> 04:45.360
I just want a little
something extra, Burke.

04:45.427 --> 04:47.928
I think I deserve
a little something extra.

04:47.996 --> 04:49.764
Let me think.
No.

04:57.006 --> 04:58.940
There's your little
something extra.

05:03.346 --> 05:05.380
So...

05:05.448 --> 05:09.084
Tell me about your guys
in Miami.

05:09.186 --> 05:13.186

== sync, corrected by <font color="#00ff00">elderman</font> ==

05:21.611 --> 05:23.478
Operatives working
under deep cover

05:23.546 --> 05:25.113
spend a lot of time alone.

05:25.181 --> 05:27.449
And no matter how hard
you've trained for it,

05:27.516 --> 05:30.084
the isolation
never gets easier.

05:30.152 --> 05:32.520
Since every meeting you take
could compromise

05:32.587 --> 05:34.388
the operation
and blow your cover,

05:34.456 --> 05:37.991
even your case officer
has to keep his distance.

05:40.194 --> 05:42.930
You only get together
when face-to-face contact

05:42.998 --> 05:44.698
is worth the risk
of getting killed.

05:44.766 --> 05:46.766
Oh, that's too bad.

05:46.834 --> 05:48.234
I kind of liked the beard.

05:48.302 --> 05:51.871
So I got your request.

05:51.939 --> 05:53.873
And I gotta say the idea
of bringing in

05:53.941 --> 05:57.677
two non-CIA personnel
on a high priority CIA job

05:57.745 --> 05:59.779
strikes me as an awful idea.
Request denied.

05:59.847 --> 06:01.581
I need Sam and Jesse
on this job.

06:01.649 --> 06:04.017
Sam has already agreed.
I called him--

06:04.085 --> 06:05.519
Well, that's tough.
I got special forces guys

06:05.586 --> 06:07.320
coming in on a dark plane
later today.

06:07.388 --> 06:09.890
They've been training for
this exact type of situation.

06:09.957 --> 06:11.525
Burke watched me
for six months

06:11.593 --> 06:13.027
before approaching me.

06:13.095 --> 06:14.395
He's not gonna go
any easier on the guys

06:14.463 --> 06:15.663
I bring in on this job.

06:15.731 --> 06:19.000
If I use my people,
my cover is theirs.

06:19.068 --> 06:20.869
My guys
are ace operators,

06:20.937 --> 06:22.217
and they've got
fantastic covers.

06:22.238 --> 06:23.505
We forged papers
to make it look like

06:23.573 --> 06:25.741
you did multiple tours
with them in Afghanistan.

06:25.809 --> 06:27.510
Multiple tours,
is that right?

06:27.578 --> 06:29.111
Well, then, tell me.

06:29.179 --> 06:30.880
What happens
when Burke asks

06:30.948 --> 06:33.015
what their call signs
were in Kandahar,

06:33.083 --> 06:34.217
and our answers
don't match?

06:34.284 --> 06:35.952
No, I'll tell you
what happens.

06:36.020 --> 06:38.154
Your ace operatives
wash up on the beach,

06:38.222 --> 06:40.623
right next
to my dead body.

06:43.594 --> 06:45.295
Fine.
Use your friends.

06:45.362 --> 06:46.763
But there's something
you should know.

06:46.830 --> 06:48.064
Those satellite uplinks

06:48.132 --> 06:49.966
you told me
that Burke was stealing?

06:50.034 --> 06:51.835
Guess who
he's selling them to.

06:55.374 --> 06:57.542
Rafael Serano.

06:57.609 --> 06:59.143
The son of a bitch
behind the Berlin train bombing,

06:59.211 --> 07:00.545
the London bus terminal,

07:00.612 --> 07:02.453
and all that stuff
that didn't make the papers.

07:02.481 --> 07:04.015
So as I am now on the hook
for corralling

07:04.082 --> 07:07.151
not one, but two
international terrorists,

07:07.219 --> 07:08.920
I can't afford
any mistakes

07:08.987 --> 07:12.223
when your friends
start playing deep cover.

07:12.291 --> 07:15.293
They'll be fine.

07:18.230 --> 07:20.931
Here comes Porter,
at the buzzer for the win.

07:20.999 --> 07:22.033
It's up!

07:22.101 --> 07:23.835
He's good!

07:23.902 --> 07:25.269
Mr. Axe,

07:25.337 --> 07:26.770
wanna get spanked,
a little one-on-one?

07:26.838 --> 07:27.972
No, I'm good.

07:28.039 --> 07:29.874
Your secretary told me
you'd be here.

07:29.941 --> 07:31.876
So shooting hoops
at 11:00 a.m.

07:31.943 --> 07:33.610
Must be nice.

07:33.678 --> 07:35.379
- I'm working, brother.
- Are you?

07:35.446 --> 07:37.114
You see that dumpy
little drug den over there?

07:37.181 --> 07:40.417
My target's about to roll up
in a yellow Porsche.

07:40.485 --> 07:41.452
Think you can put your job
on hold?

07:41.519 --> 07:42.886
For what?

07:42.954 --> 07:44.655
Well, remember when we told
Mike we'd help him out?

07:44.722 --> 07:46.055
- Yeah.
- I just got a call.

07:46.123 --> 07:47.723
- Where is he?
- Dominican Republic.

07:47.791 --> 07:49.258
He wasn't very forthcoming
with details,

07:49.326 --> 07:50.627
but he needs backup.

07:50.694 --> 07:52.414
Look, Sam, you know
I want to help Mike out,

07:52.429 --> 07:53.496
but I got clients
to answer to, man.

07:53.564 --> 07:54.998
I can't just go
running off to the D.R.

07:55.065 --> 07:56.585
on a random Thursday.
Tell me about it.

07:56.600 --> 07:58.634
I was supposed to go have
some extra special Sammy time

07:58.702 --> 08:00.369
with Elsa this weekend,
but that ain't happening.

08:00.437 --> 08:01.971
I guess this is serious.

08:02.039 --> 08:04.741
Look, Jesse, it's either gonna
be us going or me going.

08:04.809 --> 08:05.842
I'm not gonna
leave him hanging.

08:05.910 --> 08:07.211
Okay.
It's gonna have to wait

08:07.278 --> 08:08.312
until tomorrow, though.
It can't.

08:08.379 --> 08:09.847
It's gotta be today.

08:09.914 --> 08:11.181
That's not even possible.

08:11.249 --> 08:12.182
Fake passports don't
just magically appear.

08:12.250 --> 08:13.383
We don't need them.

08:13.451 --> 08:15.219
The CIA's getting us
a dark plane.

08:15.287 --> 08:16.220
- Wow.
- Strong's gonna brief us

08:16.287 --> 08:17.621
at the airport in one hour.

08:17.689 --> 08:19.456
Okay,
but before we go meet

08:19.524 --> 08:21.258
Mr. "I made Mike
bug his best friends,"

08:21.326 --> 08:22.459
we gotta swing
by my place,

08:22.527 --> 08:23.327
so I can grab
some fresh clothes.

08:23.395 --> 08:24.628
And a shower.

08:24.696 --> 08:26.336
The plane we're flying in
is a two-seater.

08:26.364 --> 08:28.398
Fun.

08:28.466 --> 08:30.267
One of the problems
with taking a mission

08:30.335 --> 08:32.403
out of the country is
that you subtract yourself

08:32.471 --> 08:34.203
from the lives
of the people you love

08:34.272 --> 08:36.874
because they're not just going
to stop living,

08:36.942 --> 08:38.381
important things
are going to happen,

08:38.443 --> 08:39.610
and you're going
to miss them.

08:39.677 --> 08:41.779
And this is
for full custody, right?

08:41.846 --> 08:44.581
Oh, that's wonderful.
I'll be there.

08:44.649 --> 08:46.851
Wednesday's great.

08:46.918 --> 08:49.086
Okay, I'll see you
at the courthouse.

08:49.154 --> 08:50.421
Thank you.

08:50.489 --> 08:52.157
But the biggest problem
caused by your absence

08:52.224 --> 08:54.626
is that you're not there
when the people

08:54.694 --> 08:56.028
you protect
need you the most.

08:56.096 --> 08:58.130
I couldn't help
but overhear.

08:58.198 --> 08:59.465
Adopting, huh?

08:59.533 --> 09:02.802
I'm getting custody
of my grandson.

09:02.870 --> 09:04.871
Aw, that's nice.

09:04.939 --> 09:06.707
I bet
you're a wonderful grandma.

09:08.843 --> 09:11.144
You know, he looks

09:11.212 --> 09:15.115
more and more
like his daddy every day.

09:15.183 --> 09:16.583
Excuse me,
what'd you say?

09:16.651 --> 09:18.218
Where are my manners?

09:18.285 --> 09:19.852
Leo Sapienza.

09:19.920 --> 09:21.353
I knew your son
pretty well.

09:21.421 --> 09:24.290
So sorry for your loss.

09:24.358 --> 09:25.324
How'd you know Nate?

09:25.392 --> 09:27.159
He was a client.

09:27.227 --> 09:31.698
I'm in the sports entertainment
industry.

09:31.765 --> 09:33.666
You were his bookie.

09:33.734 --> 09:36.369
He was a good guy, Nate.
I really liked him.

09:36.436 --> 09:39.772
But the kid could not pick
a team to save his life.

09:39.840 --> 09:41.674
He lost a lot of money,

09:41.742 --> 09:44.844
a lot of money
that he couldn't pay back.

09:44.912 --> 09:49.149
Listen, my son's gambling
problems were just that--

09:49.217 --> 09:50.550
his problems, not mine.

09:50.618 --> 09:52.419
Now if you'll excuse me...

09:52.487 --> 09:54.521
Oh, actually,
they've become your problems.

09:54.589 --> 09:57.792
You see, for a while, I was
collecting from Nate's ex,

09:57.859 --> 09:59.827
and she was very good
about paying,

09:59.894 --> 10:02.229
so long as she had
the kid.

10:02.297 --> 10:04.999
But now she doesn't,
and you do...

10:05.066 --> 10:07.434
- If you touch Charlie--
- Whoa!

10:07.502 --> 10:09.003
Why would I do anything
to Charlie?

10:09.071 --> 10:11.138
You pay me the 80 grand
that's outstanding--

10:11.206 --> 10:13.273
80,000?

10:13.341 --> 10:15.609
- I-I can't--
- Aw.

10:15.677 --> 10:17.411
Everybody always
says "can't."

10:17.479 --> 10:19.013
But I'm an optimist.

10:19.080 --> 10:21.480
I find that people are much more
resourceful than they think.

10:21.483 --> 10:23.918
You call family.
You call friends.

10:23.985 --> 10:25.319
You look
in the couch cushions.

10:25.387 --> 10:27.454
You'll come up
with the money...

10:27.522 --> 10:28.922
For Charlie.

10:28.990 --> 10:33.127
Oh, and by the way, if you're
thinking about running,

10:33.194 --> 10:36.396
just know I'm a man
with a lot of powerful friends.

10:38.299 --> 10:40.767
New York, L.A., Dallas,
you go here, you go there,

10:40.835 --> 10:44.371
I will know someone,
and I will find you.

10:47.910 --> 10:49.043
Hey.
Charlie!

10:50.646 --> 10:52.179
Stop it!
Let me go!

10:52.247 --> 10:53.848
Charlie!

10:53.915 --> 10:56.550
Charlie, what did
the man give you?

11:05.393 --> 11:06.960
I got here as fast
as I could.

11:07.028 --> 11:09.529
What's up?
You sounded so upset.

11:09.597 --> 11:10.897
I need you
to watch Charlie.

11:10.965 --> 11:12.632
What's going on?

11:12.700 --> 11:14.167
Well, a situation's come up.
I'm taking care of it.

11:14.235 --> 11:16.703
I just need you
to just stay here a few days,

11:16.770 --> 11:18.037
keep an eye on the house,

11:18.105 --> 11:20.340
make sure nobody
comes around bothering Charlie.

11:20.407 --> 11:22.642
Madeline, you can't
ask me to guard Charlie

11:22.710 --> 11:25.011
without giving me a reason.

11:25.079 --> 11:27.180
Nate's old bookie
approached me

11:27.248 --> 11:28.581
in the marina today.

11:28.649 --> 11:31.351
Apparently, Nate owed him
another $80,000,

11:31.419 --> 11:32.686
and now the debt is mine.
What?

11:32.754 --> 11:34.021
It's fine.

11:34.089 --> 11:35.923
I've called friends.
I can get the money.

11:35.991 --> 11:38.358
I want to pay him,
and that'll be the end of it.

11:38.426 --> 11:40.561
Absolutely not.
You cannot pay this man.

11:40.629 --> 11:42.964
I don't have a choice,
Fiona.

11:43.032 --> 11:44.566
This isn't just some bookie.

11:44.633 --> 11:45.994
This guy is connected
to the Mafia.

11:46.002 --> 11:47.836
Well, it doesn't matter
who his friends are.

11:47.903 --> 11:50.004
Nate owed money
to a lot of people.

11:50.072 --> 11:51.739
If word gets out that
you're paying off his debt,

11:51.807 --> 11:53.608
then every shark out there
will smell blood

11:53.676 --> 11:55.410
and come swimming
your way.

11:55.478 --> 11:59.314
Then I-I don't know
what it is you want me to do.

11:59.382 --> 12:02.617
This guy gave a bullet
to a three-year-old.

12:06.822 --> 12:09.758
I just wish
Michael were here.

12:09.825 --> 12:12.060
Well, he isn't.

12:12.127 --> 12:13.327
We'll take care
of this ourselves.

12:13.395 --> 12:17.698
Fi, I'm scared.
Please.

12:17.766 --> 12:19.834
I'm worried
Charlie's gonna get hurt.

12:19.902 --> 12:21.802
Yeah, well,
someone's gonna get hurt.

12:21.870 --> 12:23.671
It won't be Charlie.

12:27.309 --> 12:29.644
There are many advantages
to flying into a country

12:29.711 --> 12:31.979
on an unregistered plane.

12:32.047 --> 12:34.115
You don't wait in lines,
you don't check bags,

12:34.183 --> 12:36.017
and you don't leave
an incriminating paper trail.

12:36.084 --> 12:39.787
The disadvantage is that
without a declared flight path,

12:39.855 --> 12:41.622
you can't land
at an airport.

12:41.690 --> 12:43.390
So the best you can hope for
is finding

12:43.458 --> 12:45.559
an open field
and flying in low.

12:45.627 --> 12:47.862
- You see them?
- Yeah, they're headed our way.

12:47.929 --> 12:49.430
Of course,
while flying in low

12:49.498 --> 12:52.165
might keep you off the radar
of the local authorities,

12:52.233 --> 12:54.634
it also means you're a lot
easier to spot from the ground.

12:59.406 --> 13:01.941
- We have a problem.
- What's that?

13:02.008 --> 13:04.109
Air traffic control
just reported some local cop

13:04.177 --> 13:06.478
fishing off Playa Gringo,
thinks he saw a drug plane.

13:06.545 --> 13:08.112
No time to move
the landing site.

13:08.180 --> 13:09.747
No, they've got a visual
on them by now.

13:09.815 --> 13:12.717
Cops are gonna be here
in ten minutes.

13:12.785 --> 13:15.153
Can your guys
handle the heat?

13:15.221 --> 13:18.057
Shouldn't be a problem.

13:22.830 --> 13:24.798
You must be Mr. Burke.
Sam Axe.

13:24.866 --> 13:26.199
Local P.D.'s already
en route.

13:26.267 --> 13:27.667
They're gonna come out
of those trees any minute.

13:27.735 --> 13:29.969
Well, that's not good.
We better roll out of here.

13:30.037 --> 13:31.237
Can't. The road doesn't
connect with anything

13:31.305 --> 13:32.739
wider than a footpath
for 5 miles.

13:32.807 --> 13:33.940
We need to cut them off.

13:34.008 --> 13:35.742
How much fuel is left
in the plane?

13:35.810 --> 13:36.943
Not enough to get back
to the states,

13:37.011 --> 13:38.244
but enough
for what you're thinking.

13:38.312 --> 13:39.579
Sam, I need a fuse.
Jesse, grab a flare.

13:39.647 --> 13:41.481
We're gonna use the plane
to block the road.

13:44.051 --> 13:45.752
We have seconds!
Let's move!

13:57.964 --> 14:00.766
Welcome to the team.

14:17.122 --> 14:18.890
So Michael tells me
you're pretty good

14:18.958 --> 14:20.492
at stealing things,
you two.

14:20.559 --> 14:21.893
That's funny.

14:21.961 --> 14:23.595
I think what Mike meant
to say was we are the best.

14:23.663 --> 14:25.430
We've been pulling jobs
in Miami for years.

14:25.498 --> 14:26.965
Trucks are
a personal favorite.

14:27.033 --> 14:29.167
Well, the one I want
is in that warehouse.

14:29.235 --> 14:31.403
The first guy I talked to
about this job had a plan,

14:31.470 --> 14:33.605
taking out the guards
at the front gate

14:33.673 --> 14:34.940
and then pulling
the truck out bloody.

14:35.008 --> 14:36.408
Is that pretty much
what you're thinking?

14:36.476 --> 14:38.116
Any idiot can throw a rock
at a wasp nest.

14:38.145 --> 14:39.111
We're the finesse guys.

14:39.179 --> 14:40.212
We'll get your truck

14:40.280 --> 14:41.580
and make
a much smaller mess.

14:41.648 --> 14:43.081
That sounds good.
How do you do it?

14:43.149 --> 14:44.589
Well, I think
the best bet's gonna be

14:44.651 --> 14:46.452
to bypass the alarm,
cut through the fence

14:46.519 --> 14:47.620
closer to the warehouse.

14:47.687 --> 14:48.888
Which one of us
is going in?

14:48.956 --> 14:50.323
- I am.
- Okay, great.

14:50.390 --> 14:51.357
So we cover Mike's approach
to the truck--

14:51.425 --> 14:52.926
What about the guards?

14:52.994 --> 14:54.427
Once the alarm's disabled,
they won't be paying

14:54.495 --> 14:56.463
any attention until Mike's
already headed for the exit.

14:56.531 --> 14:57.764
The truck
is heavily armored.

14:57.832 --> 14:59.166
The door is bolted shut.
How we opening it?

14:59.233 --> 15:00.600
I'll be prying it open.

15:00.668 --> 15:02.068
Once Mike is in,
he hot-wires it,

15:02.136 --> 15:03.904
introduces pedal to floor,
and just drives out.

15:03.971 --> 15:06.140
All right,
sounds good.

15:06.207 --> 15:08.009
What happens if Michael
gets in trouble,

15:08.077 --> 15:09.411
somebody spots him?

15:09.479 --> 15:11.613
Well, then I cover his escape
with a sniper rifle,

15:11.681 --> 15:13.882
we regroup and figure out
some other way to do this.

15:13.950 --> 15:15.550
I like it,
right until the last part.

15:15.618 --> 15:17.453
I'm not doing
this job twice.

15:17.520 --> 15:20.456
Michael gets in trouble,
if anybody spots him,

15:20.524 --> 15:22.025
you use that sniper rifle
to take 'em out.

15:22.093 --> 15:23.961
You understand?

15:24.028 --> 15:25.462
Sam, you got a problem
with that?

15:25.530 --> 15:27.999
No, no problem.
Take 'em out.

15:28.067 --> 15:29.200
Good.

15:35.709 --> 15:37.342
"You got a problem
with that?"

15:37.410 --> 15:39.244
Those were
your exact words.

15:39.312 --> 15:41.593
As it happens, I do have a
problem shooting random guards.

15:41.648 --> 15:43.449
If we're careful,
it won't be necessary.

15:43.516 --> 15:44.850
What if it is?

15:44.917 --> 15:46.218
I mean, I'm the guy
with the finger on the trigger.

15:46.285 --> 15:47.686
What's going on, Mike?
This isn't like you.

15:47.753 --> 15:49.688
This is Burke's thing.
He's calling the shots.

15:49.756 --> 15:50.856
Well, maybe you
should call the shots.

15:50.924 --> 15:52.659
It's just not
how it works, Sam!

15:52.726 --> 15:54.160
Well,
how does it work, Mike?

15:54.228 --> 15:56.263
I want to find out what happened
to my best friend.

15:56.330 --> 15:58.899
You say, "Come on down here."
And guess what.

15:58.967 --> 16:01.135
Three hours later, poof.
We're here.

16:01.202 --> 16:02.770
You want us to help you
steal a truck.

16:02.837 --> 16:04.205
We're gonna help you
do that,

16:04.273 --> 16:06.040
but you can't keep us
in the dark the whole time.

16:06.108 --> 16:08.309
The deal I made
with Strong...

16:08.377 --> 16:11.146
It wasn't just to work
for the CIA.

16:11.213 --> 16:13.648
It was to get close to Burke
and take him down.

16:13.716 --> 16:14.949
Okay, and?

16:15.017 --> 16:16.884
Remember
that CIA holding facility?

16:16.952 --> 16:21.189
If I don't take him down,
we all go back there.

16:21.257 --> 16:24.126
For good.

16:24.193 --> 16:25.861
Wow.

16:25.929 --> 16:28.531
Yeah, you said it,
brother.

16:38.743 --> 16:40.244
I think I figured out
how to get rid

16:40.312 --> 16:42.046
of this Sapienza guy.
How?

16:42.113 --> 16:43.647
If you pooled together
all your valuables,

16:43.715 --> 16:44.781
how much would you have?

16:44.849 --> 16:47.618
In my savings account,
$24,000,

16:47.686 --> 16:50.021
plus an additional
$8,000 or $10,000

16:50.088 --> 16:51.823
if I include my jewelry.
Great.

16:51.891 --> 16:53.225
We're gonna need
all that.

16:53.292 --> 16:54.326
Do you still have
that silver pendant necklace?

16:54.393 --> 16:55.994
Yeah.
It was my mom's favorite.

16:56.062 --> 16:58.397
- I'm gonna need that too.
- Fiona, what is this?

16:58.464 --> 17:00.932
Criminals can't keep
their money in a bank.

17:01.000 --> 17:03.234
They have to keep it in a safe
or a lockbox somewhere,

17:03.302 --> 17:06.304
so we give this Sapienza guy
something to squirrel away,

17:06.372 --> 17:08.239
and then we find his stash,
and we take it.

17:08.307 --> 17:09.741
- And then?
- Mafia bookies--

17:09.809 --> 17:12.010
they're only powerful
if they keep bringing in cash

17:12.077 --> 17:13.544
to the big boys upstairs.

17:13.612 --> 17:15.646
If he loses their money,
he has only two choices--

17:15.714 --> 17:18.016
run or die.

17:18.084 --> 17:20.151
A GPS tracker
can actively

17:20.219 --> 17:22.138
transmit its location
from anywhere in the world.

17:22.188 --> 17:24.089
Units small enough to hide,
however,

17:24.156 --> 17:25.757
aren't usually very precise,

17:25.825 --> 17:28.460
which means even though you can
follow it everywhere it goes,

17:28.528 --> 17:30.996
you won't be getting much closer
than a general area.

17:31.064 --> 17:33.565
That's why it's a good idea
to pair your GPS tracker

17:33.633 --> 17:36.468
with a passive radio frequency
identification tag.

17:36.536 --> 17:38.970
You can be sure that
whatever you're looking for,

17:39.038 --> 17:40.305
you'll find it.

17:40.373 --> 17:42.674
Now you just need
to call your new friend.

17:49.381 --> 17:52.183
He's here.

17:52.250 --> 17:53.651
You good?

17:53.718 --> 17:55.752
Yes, I am.

18:02.359 --> 18:05.694
Hey.
Look at you.

18:05.762 --> 18:08.197
Same day.

18:08.265 --> 18:11.366
So...

18:11.434 --> 18:13.402
You have my money, yes?

18:13.469 --> 18:15.470
I did the best I could.

18:15.538 --> 18:16.872
This is $24,000.

18:16.939 --> 18:20.442
Oh, that is
so disappointing.

18:20.510 --> 18:22.478
Why would you ask me to come
all the way over here

18:22.546 --> 18:23.913
if you didn't have
all my money?

18:23.981 --> 18:25.982
Maybe the math
is over your head,

18:26.050 --> 18:28.418
but less than 80 is not 80.

18:28.486 --> 18:31.355
I know, but it's everything
I have to my name.

18:31.422 --> 18:33.090
I took it out
of my savings account.

18:33.157 --> 18:35.959
Please take it,
but I was thinking

18:36.027 --> 18:39.429
you could take my jewelry
as collateral.

18:40.998 --> 18:43.634
I see 5 grand in here,

18:43.701 --> 18:45.302
maybe 8 if the diamond
is real.

18:45.370 --> 18:47.203
You can just hold onto it

18:47.271 --> 18:48.705
until I can get you
the rest of your money.

18:48.773 --> 18:50.540
I only need a few more--
days.

18:50.608 --> 18:51.908
You know, that's funny.

18:51.976 --> 18:53.877
You know who else always
needed a few more days?

18:53.945 --> 18:56.013
Your loser son.

18:56.080 --> 18:57.614
And I would give them
to him,

18:57.682 --> 18:59.616
and then
I would show up,

18:59.684 --> 19:02.052
and he would be gone
or sick or drunk,

19:02.120 --> 19:03.853
and there would be
no money.

19:03.921 --> 19:06.589
I thought
that you understood

19:06.657 --> 19:08.624
what was going to happen
to a little boy

19:08.692 --> 19:10.693
who lives in this house
if I don't get my money.

19:10.761 --> 19:12.061
- Just--just wait!
- Oh, Charlie!

19:12.129 --> 19:13.963
Please!

19:16.066 --> 19:19.135
You know why Nate never
gave you my phone number?

19:19.203 --> 19:22.505
Because he knew
I'd find a way to pay.

19:22.572 --> 19:25.841
And you're right, okay?

19:25.909 --> 19:27.910
Nate was a loser.

19:27.978 --> 19:31.313
He was a loser
and a drunk

19:31.381 --> 19:34.550
and a drug addict.

19:34.618 --> 19:36.118
But I'm not him.

19:36.186 --> 19:37.887
Just give me
a few more days,

19:37.955 --> 19:39.389
and I will find you
your money.

19:39.457 --> 19:42.225
I promise.

19:44.295 --> 19:47.297
You have three more days.
Three.

19:47.365 --> 19:51.501
And just remember
one more thing--

19:51.568 --> 19:54.404
I own you.

20:11.788 --> 20:14.324
Okay, remember, we get in,
get the truck, and get out.

20:14.391 --> 20:16.092
We got one shot
at this.

20:16.160 --> 20:17.827
One shot's all we need.

20:19.597 --> 20:21.898
The key to getting
through a high-security fence

20:21.965 --> 20:24.834
is understanding
how it works.

20:24.901 --> 20:27.270
The fence itself is usually
divided into sections

20:27.338 --> 20:28.538
with a current
flowing through.

20:28.605 --> 20:30.940
Cut a section,
and an alarm goes off,

20:31.007 --> 20:34.009
pinpointing the location
that's been tampered with.

20:34.077 --> 20:36.378
To compromise one of
the sections, you have to match

20:36.446 --> 20:39.782
the precise current
coming through the fence.

20:39.850 --> 20:41.851
Fortunately,
electric alarms usually use

20:41.919 --> 20:44.120
intermittent pulses
rather than a continuous signal,

20:44.188 --> 20:46.623
which means you can tap
into the system

20:46.690 --> 20:48.625
as long as you do it
in between pulses.

20:48.693 --> 20:50.827
Do it right, no one ever knows
you were there.

20:50.894 --> 20:51.961
Cut on three.

20:52.029 --> 20:55.131
One, two, three.

20:57.234 --> 21:00.102
All you, Sammy.

21:08.444 --> 21:10.880
Okay, quick like a bunny,
Mike.

21:15.052 --> 21:17.787
Okay, he's en route.
How's our exit looking?

21:17.854 --> 21:20.289
I'll be ready out here.

21:27.631 --> 21:28.931
Okay, Mike,
you're clear.

21:28.999 --> 21:31.334
You're clear.
Go.

21:42.313 --> 21:43.147
Okay, you're clear.
Go to the truck.

21:43.215 --> 21:45.182
Go to the truck.

22:04.704 --> 22:05.838
Uhoh.

22:05.906 --> 22:06.939
I got a guard
moving toward Mike.

22:07.007 --> 22:08.073
Oh, Jesus.

22:08.141 --> 22:09.442
You think he heard
the spreader?

22:09.509 --> 22:11.844
No. The knucklehead just wants
to sneak a smoke.

22:11.912 --> 22:14.446
Come on, you dumb son
of a bitch, turn around.

22:16.516 --> 22:18.617
- Sam, he's not turning around.
- Damn it.

22:18.685 --> 22:20.018
- How we doing, fellas?
- We're good.

22:20.086 --> 22:21.553
Sam, if that guard
raises the alarm--

22:21.621 --> 22:24.422
Yeah, I know that.

22:24.490 --> 22:27.558
Jesus Christ,
turn around, man.

22:40.005 --> 22:42.440
Okay, he's in.

23:15.709 --> 23:17.543
Go!

23:39.898 --> 23:42.367
Are you okay?

23:42.435 --> 23:45.203
Yeah.

23:45.270 --> 23:46.204
Yeah, I'm fine.

23:52.747 --> 23:54.281
Just got word from Westen.

23:54.349 --> 23:55.649
He's securing this warehouse

23:55.717 --> 23:57.184
and the surrounding area
tomorrow.

23:57.252 --> 23:59.319
Looks like Burke's in a hurry
to make this sale happen.

23:59.387 --> 24:01.054
I want snipers
in these windows here

24:01.122 --> 24:02.923
and on those rooftops there.

24:02.990 --> 24:04.491
Westen's gonna be wired
for sound,

24:04.559 --> 24:05.725
we're gonna know
when the deal is done.

24:05.793 --> 24:07.427
Special Forces
are gonna work

24:07.495 --> 24:09.830
in two capture teams
to sweep up Serano and Burke

24:09.897 --> 24:12.199
as they try to drive away.

24:12.266 --> 24:14.668
Are there any questions?

24:14.736 --> 24:16.303
Um, I have a question.

24:16.371 --> 24:17.738
What are we supposed
to be doing?

24:17.806 --> 24:18.939
Well, first,
you're gonna be

24:19.007 --> 24:20.407
fully briefing my men
on Burke,

24:20.475 --> 24:23.077
and then you're gonna catch
a boat back to Miami.

24:23.144 --> 24:25.079
Yeah, um...

24:25.146 --> 24:26.213
That ain't happening, pal.

24:26.281 --> 24:27.581
I'm sorry.

24:27.649 --> 24:28.883
What "ain't happening"?
We're not leaving.

24:28.951 --> 24:30.885
We're gonna stay here
to see this through.

24:30.953 --> 24:34.756
Uh, guys, could you excuse us
just for a minute?

24:36.025 --> 24:38.126
I think maybe you need
a refresher

24:38.194 --> 24:41.263
on who gives the orders
around here.

24:41.331 --> 24:43.532
I killed a man today,

24:43.600 --> 24:45.501
so I am not going anywhere

24:45.568 --> 24:47.288
until I know that he didn't die
for nothing.

24:47.304 --> 24:49.538
Okay, now, before you shed
too many tears

24:49.606 --> 24:51.840
for that merc you iced,
you should know something.

24:51.908 --> 24:53.275
The company
that he worked for

24:53.343 --> 24:55.103
makes most of its money
wiping out villages--

24:55.145 --> 24:57.046
You know what, just stop!
All right?

24:57.113 --> 25:01.283
Do not try and make me
feel better about this.

25:01.351 --> 25:03.585
There's something
you should know about me.

25:03.653 --> 25:07.322
When I take a job, I finish it,
so we're staying.

25:07.390 --> 25:08.557
You want me gone?

25:08.625 --> 25:11.226
You arrest me
and cart me out of here.

25:15.031 --> 25:17.766
All right, you and Porter
want to stay,

25:17.834 --> 25:19.668
watch us take down
these bastards tomorrow?

25:19.736 --> 25:21.537
Knock yourselves out.

25:21.604 --> 25:23.939
You have earned that much.

25:24.007 --> 25:25.941
Let's just be very clear
about something.

25:26.009 --> 25:28.911
The key word here
is "watch."

25:31.781 --> 25:34.516
Modern tracking equipment
can help you follow someone

25:34.584 --> 25:35.917
without being seen,

25:35.985 --> 25:37.419
but once you've found
his base of operations,

25:37.487 --> 25:39.288
you still have
to do surveillance

25:39.355 --> 25:41.857
the old-fashioned way,
which sometimes means waiting.

25:41.924 --> 25:43.125
We've been sitting here
since noon.

25:43.192 --> 25:45.294
Does this guy
ever go home?

25:45.361 --> 25:47.963
Bookies keep odd hours.
He leaves when he leaves.

25:48.031 --> 25:51.634
We'll just have to wait here
until then.

25:51.701 --> 25:54.136
You all right?

25:54.204 --> 25:56.873
Yeah, I'm okay.

25:56.940 --> 25:59.408
Just those things
I said earlier.

25:59.476 --> 26:02.478
About Nate?

26:02.546 --> 26:03.879
You just said
what you needed to say.

26:03.947 --> 26:05.848
Those things weren't true.

26:05.916 --> 26:07.250
Except they were.

26:07.318 --> 26:09.186
Maybe if I'd just done it
differently

26:09.253 --> 26:12.389
when he was little, Nate--

26:12.456 --> 26:14.858
It's not your fault.

26:14.926 --> 26:19.162
I wish
I believed that.

26:19.230 --> 26:21.432
Maybe I'm crazy thinking
that I can do it

26:21.499 --> 26:24.468
better for Charlie.

26:24.536 --> 26:27.405
Well,
there's our favorite bookie.

26:27.473 --> 26:29.841
And he's not carrying
your jewelry box,

26:29.909 --> 26:33.278
so I guess
he stashed it.

26:33.346 --> 26:36.815
Madeline, you know
what you're doing for Charlie?

26:36.883 --> 26:39.351
This.

26:39.419 --> 26:42.288
Let's go teach
this bastard a lesson.

26:48.195 --> 26:50.196
And there it is.

26:50.263 --> 26:51.797
Inside the wall?

26:51.865 --> 26:53.399
Yeah, it could be
a file cabinet,

26:53.467 --> 26:54.700
but I'm thinking safe.

26:54.768 --> 26:55.901
You know,
this could get really loud.

26:55.969 --> 26:57.603
You want to wait
around the building?

26:57.671 --> 27:01.874
I want to help, unless you
think it's not a good idea.

27:01.942 --> 27:05.444
No, I think
it's a wonderful idea.

27:05.512 --> 27:07.145
We're gonna punch a hole
in this wall

27:07.213 --> 27:08.580
using this detonating cord.

27:08.647 --> 27:11.549
It's filled
with a high explosive, PETN.

27:11.617 --> 27:14.051
Okay, the first step is
to figure out how much we need.

27:14.119 --> 27:17.154
The average wall safe
is about 2 feet by 3,

27:17.222 --> 27:18.989
so we need about 25 feet
of det-cord.

27:19.057 --> 27:20.824
Now we need to tape it up
around the safe,

27:20.892 --> 27:22.592
using the weakest part
of the wall.

27:22.660 --> 27:23.627
Where do you think that is?

27:23.694 --> 27:25.662
Between the bricks.

27:25.729 --> 27:26.696
Yep.

27:26.763 --> 27:27.797
There.

27:27.864 --> 27:29.332
Thank you, Fiona.

27:29.399 --> 27:30.800
This has been
very satisfying.

27:30.867 --> 27:32.868
This will be satisfying.

27:38.574 --> 27:40.442
Whenever you're ready.

27:53.090 --> 27:54.724
You're a natural.

27:54.791 --> 27:55.624
Come on.

28:00.931 --> 28:02.265
Look alive, people.

28:02.332 --> 28:03.700
We got our operative
inside the warehouse.

28:03.768 --> 28:07.137
When Burke and Serano arrive,
I want everybody ready.

28:16.514 --> 28:17.848
Sam, that road...

28:17.916 --> 28:19.217
Yeah, it doesn't make sense
to me either.

28:19.284 --> 28:20.418
There's a blind corner
at the end.

28:20.485 --> 28:22.086
There's only one way
in and out.

28:22.153 --> 28:24.922
Yeah, Strong,
I gotta talk to you.

28:24.989 --> 28:26.223
It doesn't make sense
for Burke to set up

28:26.291 --> 28:28.391
at the end of a street
with only one--

28:28.459 --> 28:29.426
- if you have any concerns,
let the captain know.

28:29.493 --> 28:30.793
He's the one to talk to.

28:30.861 --> 28:32.062
Yeah, well, I'm talking
to you right now.

28:32.129 --> 28:33.964
Now listen, Jesse and I
hung out with Burke.

28:34.031 --> 28:35.198
He's a smart guy.

28:35.266 --> 28:36.866
He could meet anywhere
in Santo Domingo,

28:36.934 --> 28:38.701
so ask yourself, why here?

28:38.769 --> 28:40.636
Look, all I'm saying is
I think you need

28:40.704 --> 28:43.072
to grab everybody before they
get into that warehouse.

28:43.139 --> 28:44.039
Play it safe.

28:44.107 --> 28:45.408
I am playing it safe.

28:45.475 --> 28:47.235
That's why I have sniper teams
on every roof.

28:47.244 --> 28:48.611
Great, then you should use
every single one

28:48.678 --> 28:50.212
of those sniper teams
to take out Serano and Burke

28:50.280 --> 28:51.380
before they even
get there.

28:51.447 --> 28:52.748
It's not happening.

28:52.816 --> 28:54.416
Langley wants a recording
of this deal,

28:54.484 --> 28:57.085
so guess what Langley's
gonna get.

28:57.153 --> 28:58.887
We have a confirmed visual
on Burke.

28:58.955 --> 29:01.223
Repeat, a confirmed visual
on Burke.

29:01.290 --> 29:02.858
Okay.
Good talk.

29:02.926 --> 29:03.992
Time for me to work.

29:13.971 --> 29:16.305
All right, everyone,
we're on.

29:23.081 --> 29:25.149
When was
your last perimeter sweep?

29:25.216 --> 29:27.384
- 15 minutes ago, all clear.
- Good.

29:27.452 --> 29:29.287
Burke, I know
this isn't great timing,

29:29.354 --> 29:31.189
but I'm concerned

29:31.257 --> 29:33.191
about the exit routes,
this location.

29:33.259 --> 29:35.227
If there's any way to push
the timeline--

29:35.294 --> 29:36.395
Too late for that, man.

29:36.462 --> 29:37.763
It's on.

29:37.831 --> 29:39.732
I understand
you're concerned,

29:39.800 --> 29:41.167
but I picked this place
for a reason, Mike.

29:41.234 --> 29:43.035
I don't even know
who we're meeting with.

29:43.103 --> 29:44.436
Oh, I'm not gonna lie
to you.

29:44.504 --> 29:45.638
He's a bad man.

29:45.705 --> 29:46.905
You hired me
for your security.

29:46.973 --> 29:48.407
You're doing
a great job.

29:48.474 --> 29:50.275
All you've got to do now
is cover me.

29:50.342 --> 29:52.543
Just stay sharp, Michael.

29:52.611 --> 29:54.512
Stay focused.

29:54.579 --> 29:56.013
It's all gonna work out.

29:56.081 --> 29:58.081
I promise.

29:58.149 --> 29:59.950
None of this crap
makes any sense.

30:00.017 --> 30:01.451
What the hell
is Burke doing?

30:01.519 --> 30:02.719
I don't know.

30:02.787 --> 30:03.987
Serano is approaching
in a black sedan.

30:04.055 --> 30:05.322
We have a visual on Serano.

30:05.390 --> 30:06.657
Look alive, people.

30:06.724 --> 30:08.525
All the pieces
are on the board.

30:23.374 --> 30:25.242
Mr. Serano.

30:25.309 --> 30:27.778
Boy, you're a busy man.

30:27.845 --> 30:28.779
Hard to get face-to-face time
with you.

30:28.846 --> 30:30.113
You know how it is.

30:30.181 --> 30:32.249
When you have half
a dozen international agencies

30:32.316 --> 30:33.784
calling for your head,

30:33.851 --> 30:35.385
you only come up for air
on special occasions,

30:35.453 --> 30:37.121
like this.

30:37.189 --> 30:40.057
This is a special occasion,
Mr. Burke.

30:40.125 --> 30:42.359
It's not easy to come
by something like this.

30:42.427 --> 30:43.761
Believe me,
I've tried.

30:43.829 --> 30:45.897
It's obvious you went
to a lot of trouble to get it.

30:45.964 --> 30:48.065
Thank you.
Actually, yeah.

30:48.133 --> 30:49.266
A little bit of trouble.

30:49.334 --> 30:50.301
The things
we have to do

30:50.369 --> 30:51.435
to do our jobs
these days, no?

30:51.503 --> 30:53.270
Now if you want to do business

30:53.338 --> 30:54.572
or use a computer,
talk on the phone--

30:54.639 --> 30:56.673
if you had told me
20 years ago

30:56.741 --> 30:58.742
that I'd be spending
$25 million just to have

30:58.809 --> 31:00.744
a private phone conversation

31:00.812 --> 31:02.879
without some <i>puto</i>
of a spy listening...

31:04.448 --> 31:06.416
I would have said
you were crazy.

31:06.484 --> 31:08.919
<i>Pero</i> here we are.

31:08.987 --> 31:10.620
So how do you want
to do it?

31:10.688 --> 31:15.024
I have bearer bonds, cash,
or gold if you prefer.

31:15.092 --> 31:17.660
I don't want your money.

31:27.438 --> 31:29.873
I just want you.

31:32.927 --> 31:34.799
I want to know
what the hell is going on

31:34.800 --> 31:35.733
in that warehouse!

31:35.801 --> 31:36.834
What are those shots?

31:36.902 --> 31:38.936
Alpha team, Bravo team,
report in.

31:39.004 --> 31:40.438
Tell me you have a visual.

31:40.506 --> 31:42.740
That's a negative.
I got nothing.

31:42.808 --> 31:44.342
We're staring
at a concrete wall.

31:44.410 --> 31:45.977
We gotta get in there.
You heard those shots.

31:46.044 --> 31:47.278
Yes, I did,
and I'm not doing anything

31:47.345 --> 31:48.980
till I know
what's happening.

31:49.047 --> 31:50.247
I don't know what you think
you're doing, Mr. Burke,

31:50.315 --> 31:52.683
but you just made
a very serious mistake,

31:52.751 --> 31:54.785
which you'll pay for,
I promise you.

31:54.853 --> 31:56.387
Oh, come on,
stop making promises,

31:56.455 --> 31:57.888
especially ones
you can't keep.

31:57.956 --> 31:59.256
Tie him up.

31:59.324 --> 32:00.925
Sounds like Burke shot
Serano's bodyguards.

32:00.992 --> 32:02.293
Mike's still alive.

32:02.360 --> 32:03.560
Yeah, for now.

32:03.628 --> 32:04.895
Don't be stupid,
Mr. Burke.

32:04.963 --> 32:07.664
My people will find me.

32:07.732 --> 32:09.866
And when they do,
they will kill you,

32:09.934 --> 32:14.171
your family,
everyone you know.

32:14.239 --> 32:15.105
You want to make a deal.
Let's--

32:15.173 --> 32:17.041
There's no deal to be made.

32:17.109 --> 32:19.578
You see, the thing is
you have information,

32:19.645 --> 32:22.247
information that is valuable
to the people I work for.

32:22.314 --> 32:23.481
It's that simple.

32:23.549 --> 32:25.049
Work for?

32:25.117 --> 32:26.397
Who the hell does Burke
work for?

32:26.452 --> 32:27.886
Get Langley
on the phone.

32:27.954 --> 32:28.987
You said Burke
ran his own show.

32:29.055 --> 32:30.189
All our intelligence
said he did.

32:30.256 --> 32:31.790
Wait a minute.
You guys hear that?

32:33.393 --> 32:34.860
Sir, we got incoming!

32:34.928 --> 32:36.361
Aw, crap.

32:36.429 --> 32:38.530
We got bigger problems
than calling the CIA.

32:38.598 --> 32:40.098
Tell me that chopper
is yours, Strong.

32:40.166 --> 32:42.134
Jesus. No.

32:42.201 --> 32:45.304
Get the snipers
under cover, now!

32:47.007 --> 32:48.674
Burke,
this is Raven four.

32:48.741 --> 32:50.876
What the hell is going on
down there?

32:50.944 --> 32:52.211
Raven four,
this is Burke.

32:52.279 --> 32:53.346
What do you mean?
We're ready for exfil.

32:53.413 --> 32:55.314
The hell you are.

32:55.382 --> 32:57.416
You got a hot L.Z.
You got hostiles everywhere.

32:57.484 --> 32:59.985
Raven four,
confirm hostiles.

33:00.053 --> 33:03.623
Snipers,
all over the place.

33:03.690 --> 33:05.224
How many are there?

33:05.292 --> 33:07.160
How many what?

33:10.797 --> 33:12.431
How many snipers
are there?

33:12.499 --> 33:16.602
Man, I have no idea
what you're talking about.

33:16.670 --> 33:17.503
I'm gonna give you
one last chance.

33:17.571 --> 33:19.739
Wait, wait, wait!

33:19.807 --> 33:21.674
How could I
have snipers here?

33:21.742 --> 33:24.877
You just gave me the location
40 minutes ago!

33:24.945 --> 33:26.225
I did not come here
with snipers!

33:26.246 --> 33:29.214
I came here with money
to pay you!

33:38.258 --> 33:39.692
He's got a point, Mike.

33:39.760 --> 33:41.494
The hell he does.

33:41.562 --> 33:43.430
You're the one
who secured this location.

33:43.497 --> 33:45.665
How do you miss
a team of snipers?

33:45.733 --> 33:47.601
Drop the gun.
Burke, I'm on your side.

33:47.668 --> 33:48.769
Drop the gun!

33:48.836 --> 33:51.404
This is crazy.

33:51.472 --> 33:53.573
Obviously, he's lying.

33:53.641 --> 33:55.675
What is he gonna say?

33:55.743 --> 33:57.410
You think he'd just admit

33:57.478 --> 33:59.212
he brought a team of snipers
with him?

33:59.280 --> 34:00.346
He's lying!

34:00.414 --> 34:01.948
Your man is lying!

34:02.016 --> 34:02.849
Bravo team,
I want you on the move.

34:02.916 --> 34:04.350
I need eyes on Westen.

34:04.418 --> 34:05.718
Strong, we gotta get him
out of there.

34:05.786 --> 34:07.053
Waiting around
could get Mike killed.

34:07.121 --> 34:08.188
Breaching could
get him killed too.

34:08.255 --> 34:09.222
Listen to me.

34:09.290 --> 34:10.989
This makes no sense.

34:11.058 --> 34:13.226
It makes lots of sense,
Michael, unfortunately.

34:13.293 --> 34:14.927
Wish to God it didn't,
but it does.

34:14.995 --> 34:18.764
The snipers,
they're not mine!

34:18.833 --> 34:21.534
I don't know what story
you're telling yourself,

34:21.601 --> 34:23.937
but I'll prove these guys
are not mine.

34:24.005 --> 34:26.273
- What the hell is Mike doing?
- I don't know.

34:26.341 --> 34:29.643
Burke, we're friends.

34:29.712 --> 34:31.279
You're my friend,
and you're pointing a gun at me.

34:31.347 --> 34:32.681
Oh, Jesus,
I know what he's doing.

34:32.748 --> 34:34.149
Strong, shoot at him!

34:34.217 --> 34:35.150
What?

34:35.217 --> 34:36.485
Give me that.

34:36.553 --> 34:39.088
Give me your damn rifle.

34:39.156 --> 34:40.922
You think I would turn
on you, Burke?

34:40.991 --> 34:42.592
You think
I'd turn on you now?

34:47.831 --> 34:49.233
Does that make any sense?

34:49.301 --> 34:52.069
Those snipers
you're so convinced I brought

34:52.136 --> 34:53.837
just tried to blow
my head off!

34:53.905 --> 34:55.185
Now you can shoot me
if you want,

34:55.206 --> 34:56.373
but I'm getting us
out of here now.

34:56.440 --> 34:58.209
Call them off. Move!

34:58.276 --> 34:59.610
Please! No, don't!
They're going to shoot--

34:59.678 --> 35:00.845
I can't!

35:00.913 --> 35:02.380
They're not my--
give the order now.

35:02.448 --> 35:04.148
You walk in front
of that window,

35:04.216 --> 35:05.983
and you tell them
to back off,

35:06.051 --> 35:07.485
or I snap your neck
right here.

35:07.553 --> 35:09.187
Do it, Serano.

35:09.254 --> 35:11.856
Go on.

35:15.027 --> 35:17.295
Fall back!

35:17.363 --> 35:18.663
Everyone fall back!

35:18.731 --> 35:20.499
I have a confirmed visual
on Serano.

35:20.566 --> 35:22.034
Do I take the shot?

35:22.101 --> 35:23.368
Call them off!
Call them off!

35:23.436 --> 35:24.757
If they take that shot,
Mike dies.

35:24.804 --> 35:27.372
Sir, do you copy?
I have Serano in my sight.

35:27.440 --> 35:30.876
Do I take the shot?

35:30.944 --> 35:36.414
Everyone fall back!

35:36.482 --> 35:38.316
Negative.
Negative.

35:38.384 --> 35:40.852
All teams drop your weapons.
Stand down.

35:46.625 --> 35:49.027
Burke, Raven four.

35:49.095 --> 35:50.396
Whatever you did worked.

35:50.463 --> 35:53.232
Hostiles are bugging out.
L.Z. Is clear.

35:58.972 --> 36:01.541
Raven four,
this is Burke.

36:01.608 --> 36:04.744
We're ready for exfil.
Bring the chopper down.

36:21.026 --> 36:23.127
All right,
that's our ride.

36:23.195 --> 36:24.161
Bring him with.

36:24.229 --> 36:25.396
What about that?

36:25.464 --> 36:28.366
It served its purpose.

36:48.087 --> 36:48.786
Uhh!

36:57.596 --> 36:58.429
Go!

37:13.278 --> 37:15.579
God damn it!

37:15.647 --> 37:17.481
Get me Langley!

37:20.686 --> 37:22.920
- You okay?
- What's that?

37:22.988 --> 37:24.622
Are you okay?

37:24.690 --> 37:27.792
Yeah, it's just been
a long day.

37:27.860 --> 37:30.962
I was kind of hoping
it would be over.

37:32.264 --> 37:33.397
I hate to say it, Sammy,

37:33.465 --> 37:37.235
but I think this thing
is far from over.

37:47.697 --> 37:50.399
Now, that's not the face
of a happy little bookie.

37:50.467 --> 37:54.403
He does look like
he's having a rough morning.

37:54.471 --> 37:56.872
Yeah, I guess it's time
for me to make it worse.

37:56.940 --> 37:59.508
I'll be right back.
Wait, Fi.

37:59.575 --> 38:00.843
I want to go do it.

38:07.083 --> 38:11.086
There she is.

38:11.154 --> 38:13.288
So where's my money?

38:13.356 --> 38:17.092
I told you I was coming
to settle this.

38:18.460 --> 38:21.295
I never said
I was going to pay you.

38:21.363 --> 38:24.499
All right, look, lady,
I'm done being nice.

38:24.567 --> 38:25.900
Either you give me
my money,

38:25.968 --> 38:27.702
or I will sell
that grandson of yours

38:27.770 --> 38:29.337
to a button factory
in China.

38:29.405 --> 38:30.405
You hear me?

38:30.473 --> 38:32.107
I hear you.

38:32.175 --> 38:33.509
And now
you're gonna hear me.

38:33.576 --> 38:35.478
I know
why you're sweating,

38:35.545 --> 38:38.247
and I know why you're wearing
a gun today.

38:38.315 --> 38:41.851
Lose something?

38:41.919 --> 38:44.487
You?

38:44.555 --> 38:48.592
So here's how this
is gonna go.

38:48.660 --> 38:51.328
You're gonna do
exactly as I say,

38:51.396 --> 38:53.097
because if you don't,

38:53.165 --> 38:55.532
you're gonna be explaining
to your powerful friends

38:55.600 --> 38:57.802
how a woman old enough
to be your mother

38:57.869 --> 39:00.004
managed to steal your safe.

39:00.071 --> 39:02.673
I thought I'd only find money
in there,

39:02.741 --> 39:05.576
but I did a lot better
than that.

39:05.643 --> 39:09.346
Your entire client list.

39:09.414 --> 39:10.580
There's enough information
in there

39:10.648 --> 39:13.550
to put you out of business,
in jail,

39:13.617 --> 39:17.187
and maybe even
in a very early grave.

39:17.254 --> 39:18.755
You can go ahead
and keep that

39:18.823 --> 39:20.590
'cause I made a copy
for myself.

39:20.658 --> 39:23.993
All right, I made some others
for my powerful friends.

39:24.061 --> 39:25.895
What the hell do you want?

39:25.963 --> 39:27.530
Well, first things first.

39:27.598 --> 39:30.834
The money I took is now
Charlie Westen's college fund.

39:30.901 --> 39:33.270
I'll be keeping that.

39:33.337 --> 39:37.607
And you will not get
another penny out of me.

39:37.675 --> 39:42.545
And you will never, ever...

39:42.613 --> 39:46.783
ever come near me
or Charlie again.

39:46.850 --> 39:50.186
Are we clear?

39:50.254 --> 39:51.187
Yeah.

39:51.255 --> 39:52.355
I'm sorry?

39:52.423 --> 39:54.558
Yes.

39:54.625 --> 39:55.592
Yeah.

39:55.660 --> 39:57.127
Good.

39:57.195 --> 40:01.799
You'll forgive me
if I don't stay for lunch.

40:01.867 --> 40:04.002
Oh.
One more thing.

40:04.069 --> 40:07.271
Just remember.

40:07.339 --> 40:10.341
I own you.

40:18.950 --> 40:20.417
When you're undercover,

40:20.485 --> 40:23.387
it's easy to dehumanize
a target and see him

40:23.454 --> 40:26.256
as nothing more than a monster
you're trying to take down,

40:26.324 --> 40:29.626
but sometimes
they'll catch you off guard

40:29.693 --> 40:32.795
by showing you how much
they care about their cause

40:32.863 --> 40:34.397
and even how much
they care about you.

40:34.465 --> 40:37.333
Hey, Michael.

40:37.401 --> 40:39.402
I want you to know...

40:39.469 --> 40:40.969
I'm sorry about today.

40:41.037 --> 40:43.739
Those are the moments
you wait for as a spy

40:43.806 --> 40:45.807
because the closer
they are to you,

40:45.875 --> 40:48.076
the closer you are
to destroying them.

40:48.144 --> 40:49.244
Sorry doesn't cut it.

40:49.311 --> 40:51.112
What?

40:51.180 --> 40:53.448
I just found out
you have a boss.

40:53.516 --> 40:55.050
I thought it was you and me.
All right.

40:55.117 --> 40:56.217
Burke, you're part
of an organization.

40:56.285 --> 40:58.420
Am I part of it,
or am I some tool

40:58.487 --> 41:00.889
you use and throw away
when it's served its purpose?

41:00.957 --> 41:04.960
When you found me,
you told me to have faith,

41:05.028 --> 41:07.730
said either I was in or out,
right then, right there.

41:07.798 --> 41:09.799
Well, I chose in,
and everything I've done

41:09.867 --> 41:11.935
for you,
I've done without question.

41:12.002 --> 41:13.136
But now I want answers!

41:13.203 --> 41:14.971
I deserve answers!

41:15.039 --> 41:15.938
What is this?

41:16.006 --> 41:18.240
You're right.

41:18.308 --> 41:20.243
You deserve answers.

41:20.310 --> 41:23.479
Only I can't give them
to you.

41:23.547 --> 41:24.948
All I can do
is ask the man who can,

41:25.015 --> 41:27.050
and then it's up to him.

41:27.118 --> 41:29.720
You're on a path, Michael.
