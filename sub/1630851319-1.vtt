03:35.215 --> 03:37.956
Hey. Darling.

03:38.000 --> 03:40.132
Darling.

03:40.176 --> 03:42.570
Did you hear that?

03:42.613 --> 03:44.267
[distant clatter]

03:44.311 --> 03:47.618
I think someone's
in the house.

03:47.662 --> 03:49.403
[sighs]
I don't hear anything, Ray.

03:49.446 --> 03:52.014
- You're imagining.
- I'm not.

03:52.057 --> 03:54.364
Then go check.

03:54.408 --> 03:56.323
- Me?
- Yeah.

03:56.366 --> 03:58.760
Chicken.

04:00.718 --> 04:02.459
Oh, baby.

04:02.503 --> 04:04.505
[distant clattering continues]

04:04.548 --> 04:07.899
I'm gonna go check.

04:07.943 --> 04:10.946
Yeah, you do that.

04:15.690 --> 04:17.952
[camera beeps]

04:37.451 --> 04:40.280
[light clattering]

04:54.859 --> 04:57.297
She's not even there.

04:57.340 --> 05:00.604
When you open your eyes,
nothing's gonna be there.

05:00.648 --> 05:03.433
Just gonna go to bed.

05:08.612 --> 05:10.745
You are the chosen one.

06:24.079 --> 06:27.952
[hummingbird chirps]

06:32.217 --> 06:35.046
Cannot believe
they're making this crap.

06:35.090 --> 06:38.702
Found footage.
That's never been done before.

06:38.746 --> 06:41.966
I bet it's based
on true events too.

06:42.010 --> 06:43.794
Yep.
Right there on the front.

06:43.838 --> 06:45.709
"Based on true events."

06:45.753 --> 06:49.321
It's ridiculous.
Absolutely ridiculous.

06:49.365 --> 06:52.194
You know, how come the
found footage is always edited?

06:53.848 --> 06:55.850
Lilly.

06:55.893 --> 06:58.679
You are so salty.

06:58.722 --> 07:00.985
Grammar alone is infantile.

07:01.029 --> 07:02.334
[sighs]

07:02.378 --> 07:03.597
I'm getting paid.

07:03.640 --> 07:04.815
Yeah, I hope so.

07:04.859 --> 07:07.427
I'm getting paid a bonus too.

07:07.470 --> 07:08.906
Bonus?

07:08.950 --> 07:11.213
Yeah. Well, if I go viral,
I get a bonus.

07:11.256 --> 07:14.477
You know, someone should really
teach them the difference

07:14.521 --> 07:17.132
between "there" "their"
and "they are."

07:17.175 --> 07:20.135
Shh. Honey,
I am trying to focus.

07:20.178 --> 07:22.485
No, I mean, look at this.
Your character's a medium,
right?

07:22.529 --> 07:24.879
A medium and a dominatrix.

07:24.922 --> 07:30.145
Yeah. Who cons some
poor old man with tarot cards.

07:30.188 --> 07:33.409
He is a real life ghost
in the South.

07:33.453 --> 07:35.759
I'm thinking
about channeling him.

07:35.803 --> 07:38.153
And then, on page ten,

07:38.196 --> 07:41.373
needless to say you hardly
know each other at that point,

07:41.417 --> 07:43.158
what's with the bondage?

07:43.201 --> 07:45.203
[sighs]
Are you jealous?

07:45.247 --> 07:47.205
Seems gratuitous.

07:47.249 --> 07:49.947
[sighs] I don't buy the whole
past life thing either.

07:49.991 --> 07:52.341
Then why do you jump out of bed
in the middle of the night

07:52.384 --> 07:54.691
like you see ghosts?

07:54.735 --> 07:56.171
Cry.

07:56.214 --> 07:58.042
That shit's not real.

07:58.086 --> 08:00.828
My subconscious
goes crazy when I sleep,

08:00.871 --> 08:02.656
and dreams may occur.

08:02.699 --> 08:04.745
May occur?

08:04.788 --> 08:06.834
How the hell you gonna
physically sleep

08:06.877 --> 08:08.792
with a ghost anyways?

08:08.836 --> 08:10.751
They're already dead.

08:10.794 --> 08:15.582
"T-H-E-Y"
apostrophe "R-E" dead.

08:17.497 --> 08:18.889
You're an asshole.

08:18.933 --> 08:23.415
Y-O-U apostrophe
R-E an asshole.

08:24.242 --> 08:26.854
What? I--

08:26.897 --> 08:29.291
Yo, yo, yo, yo, my girl.

08:29.334 --> 08:32.337
This is about to be the best
of all the possession movies.

08:32.381 --> 08:34.557
Like, "The Exorcist"
or some shit.

08:34.601 --> 08:36.732
And I'm telling you right now,

08:36.777 --> 08:38.692
it ain't gonna be none
of that remake bullshit
that Hollywood's into,

08:38.735 --> 08:39.953
'cause I hate that shit.

08:39.996 --> 08:42.477
I'm so excited.

08:42.522 --> 08:44.219
You got another box.

08:44.261 --> 08:46.526
I'm chatting
with the director.

08:46.569 --> 08:47.962
Hey.

08:48.005 --> 08:49.833
Sup, boss man?

08:49.877 --> 08:53.097
Honey, you're going to be on
my fan-site video for the movie.

08:53.141 --> 08:55.447
Chaz is recording us right now.

08:55.491 --> 08:57.493
Eh, me out.

08:57.537 --> 08:59.669
Sorry, Ray
just likes his privacy,

08:59.713 --> 09:02.585
but he's just cranky,
Mr. Cranky Pants,

09:02.629 --> 09:05.153
because he was up
all night writing.

09:05.196 --> 09:07.416
Drinking, more like it.
[laughs]

09:07.459 --> 09:10.071
I hope there ain't going to be
no problems with this Ray cat.

09:10.114 --> 09:12.595
- Know what I'm saying?
- No. Why?

09:12.639 --> 09:14.597
I don't know, you know.
You just said, like...

09:14.641 --> 09:17.513
that we could film you
at my crib and shit
when we cast you.

09:17.557 --> 09:20.647
Like this behind the scenes
look at a professional actress.

09:20.690 --> 09:22.126
Yeah, of course.

09:22.170 --> 09:25.042
By the way,
your house is amazing.

09:25.086 --> 09:27.044
You know that when
you sign that contract,

09:27.088 --> 09:30.874
there's this little section that
says "any and all footage--"

09:30.918 --> 09:32.354
Ray will be fine.

09:32.397 --> 09:33.529
No problemo.

09:33.573 --> 09:35.836
I see you got my package.

09:35.879 --> 09:37.751
Oh, I did.
Oh, my God.

09:37.794 --> 09:38.795
What is it?

09:38.839 --> 09:41.885
Unfiltered, baby.
[laughs]

09:41.929 --> 09:43.583
Can you dig it?

09:43.626 --> 09:47.761
I have to warn you,
I'm like, totally method now.

09:47.804 --> 09:51.460
Like, Ray thinks I can be
a little scary and weird.

09:51.503 --> 09:54.028
Shit, scary and weird?
That's our business.

09:54.071 --> 09:55.682
See that right there,
that's what the horror fans--

09:55.725 --> 09:57.292
that's what they wanna see,
baby.

09:57.335 --> 09:58.815
Well, I mean,
I have a fan base,

09:58.859 --> 09:59.990
but it could so be better.

10:00.034 --> 10:01.862
It will after this movie,
baby.

10:01.905 --> 10:03.690
You gonna be a movie star.

10:03.733 --> 10:05.648
Say it with me.
Movie star.

10:05.692 --> 10:08.651
Yay. Thank you.
I am so excited.

10:08.695 --> 10:10.566
And you going viral.

10:10.610 --> 10:13.656
Honey, do you hear that?
♪ I'm gonna go viral

10:13.700 --> 10:15.658
- ♪ I'm gonna go viral

Hey.

10:17.617 --> 10:20.445
Skin is a scream queen's
necessity, yo.

10:20.489 --> 10:24.014
I promise Ray
will bare it all for you.

10:24.058 --> 10:27.278
[laughs]

10:27.322 --> 10:28.976
Shit.
You is funny, girl.

10:29.019 --> 10:31.631
But, for real, like, I don't
wanna have to recast you.

10:31.674 --> 10:33.763
Like, if your videos
ain't getting watched,

10:33.807 --> 10:35.939
and, like, people aren't
liking that shit...

10:35.983 --> 10:38.115
Oh, God. Really?

10:38.159 --> 10:40.378
I'm just playing with you.
I ain't gonna recast your ass.

10:40.422 --> 10:42.163
- You.
- [laughs]

10:42.206 --> 10:43.730
You should have seen
your face, though.

10:43.773 --> 10:46.689
Thanks again for this fab cam
and cool statue.

10:46.733 --> 10:50.519
I will totally do a bitchin'
unboxing video later for you.

10:50.562 --> 10:52.739
Hey, guys,
it's Box Girl Lilly.

10:52.782 --> 10:55.306
So I just got this
awesome new huge box

10:55.350 --> 10:57.265
I can't wait to open
for you guys.

10:57.308 --> 10:58.875
It's from my director.

10:58.919 --> 11:02.313
It says, "Lilly, you're
the next big scream queen.

11:02.357 --> 11:03.924
Sincerely, Chaz."

11:03.967 --> 11:07.797
What is that?
Oh, this is hot.

11:07.841 --> 11:09.146
What do you guys think?

11:09.190 --> 11:12.715
Should I try it on?
This looks tight.

11:12.759 --> 11:14.891
It is tight.

11:16.893 --> 11:20.592
Whoa. Cool, right?

11:20.636 --> 11:22.333
Super weird.

11:22.377 --> 11:26.207
You and me, we're going
to make a masterpiece together.

11:26.250 --> 11:30.602
[ominous music]

11:34.868 --> 11:36.739
What up, my paranormalists?

11:36.783 --> 11:40.612
It's time
for your favorite podcast,
"Beyond Paranormal."

11:40.656 --> 11:44.747
I am your host and fellow freak
Juice McDaniels.

11:44.790 --> 11:49.578
Our special guest this month is
world renowned quantum physicist

11:49.621 --> 11:52.320
Dr. Ulrich von Strauss.

11:52.363 --> 11:55.018
And today we will be asking
the question

11:55.062 --> 11:57.107
"Is time travel possible?"

11:57.151 --> 12:00.937
Better question,
do you travel in time

12:00.981 --> 12:03.026
or does time travel to you?

12:03.070 --> 12:05.768
Time and space can
be manipulated,

12:05.812 --> 12:08.989
fused together
and then displaced

12:09.032 --> 12:12.514
to create a window to
a completely different reality.

12:12.557 --> 12:14.951
Realities are what we make.
Ain't that right, Doc?

12:14.995 --> 12:19.913
Some of us live in between
realities and dimensions.

12:19.956 --> 12:21.958
You think
we are not alone?

12:22.002 --> 12:24.787
Oh, absolutely
we're not alone.

12:24.831 --> 12:27.529
We've been visited
by many alien life forms...

12:27.572 --> 12:29.574
many alien life forms...

12:32.621 --> 12:34.928
[laughs]

12:36.190 --> 12:37.669
I'm writing.

12:39.759 --> 12:41.369
Did you sign
the release form yet?

12:46.809 --> 12:49.812
Don't worry,
I'll get him to sign.

12:49.856 --> 12:54.121
These "ver" glasses are like
looking into another dimension.

12:54.164 --> 13:00.562
This is my first...
ASMR video.

13:00.605 --> 13:03.260
Robert, thank you so much
for the bear.

13:03.304 --> 13:05.959
Oh, he's so cute
and so fluffy,

13:06.002 --> 13:08.178
like a little white cloud.

13:08.222 --> 13:10.702
I'm going to sleep with him
right now.

13:10.746 --> 13:13.880
Oh, yeah, I can't "bear"
to sleep without him.

13:13.923 --> 13:16.012
Don't be jealous, Ray.

13:22.105 --> 13:23.672
Oh, shoot.

13:23.715 --> 13:25.369
Well, that's not good.

13:27.110 --> 13:29.330
Hey, everybody,
it's Box Girl Lilly.

13:29.373 --> 13:33.029
Welcome to Lilly vloggin'
the vlog.

13:33.073 --> 13:35.249
[clears throat]
Okay.

13:39.383 --> 13:41.342
Hey, guys, Lilly here again.

13:41.385 --> 13:44.258
So this is harder
than I thought.

13:44.301 --> 13:46.303
Um...

13:46.347 --> 13:49.350
But you guys will
totally dig the next video,

13:49.393 --> 13:52.135
and don't forget
to hit the like button.

13:57.053 --> 13:59.055
"Don't forget to tune in
and hit the like button."

13:59.099 --> 14:01.623
Hit the like button,
people.

14:02.711 --> 14:06.323
Hey, guys,
are you ready?

14:12.503 --> 14:15.419
[groans] Babe, will you
scratch my back, please?

14:15.463 --> 14:19.162
[sighs] This novel
is driving me crazy.

14:19.206 --> 14:21.773
Ugh. It's like
I'm writing in circles.

14:21.817 --> 14:25.647
Mm-hmm.

14:25.690 --> 14:27.910
What's with the creepy statue?

14:27.954 --> 14:29.825
Oh, I know.
Cool, right?

14:29.869 --> 14:31.958
Yeah.

14:32.001 --> 14:34.656
If by "cool"
you mean super creepy.

14:34.699 --> 14:37.354
Yeah, it's cool.
It's really cool. [sighs]

14:37.398 --> 14:39.704
Can you please not
bring evil shit in the house

14:39.748 --> 14:41.576
that may have
evil shit attached to it?

14:41.619 --> 14:43.883
[moans]
Like what?

14:43.926 --> 14:46.015
Like,
you know what I mean.

14:46.059 --> 14:48.191
- Stuff.
- What stuff?

14:48.235 --> 14:49.540
Evil shit
can attach to things,

14:49.584 --> 14:52.282
and those things
can attach to us.

14:52.326 --> 14:54.197
Like bedbugs.

14:54.241 --> 14:56.460
I'm serious.

14:56.504 --> 14:58.767
I promise,
no evil parasitic juju.

14:58.810 --> 15:00.203
This isn't a joke.

15:00.247 --> 15:03.641
Ow!
Is that real bone?

15:03.685 --> 15:06.731
My director thought
it would inspire creativity,

15:06.775 --> 15:08.951
Speaking of creativity,

15:08.995 --> 15:12.999
I think my brain's
been sucked all of mine.

15:15.566 --> 15:16.959
Oh, you're bleeding.

15:17.003 --> 15:20.397
You just need to relax.

15:22.878 --> 15:24.488
You know I need to write.

15:24.532 --> 15:28.884
Is this house not the best
writing retreat ever?

15:28.928 --> 15:30.103
It's okay.

15:30.146 --> 15:31.278
Have you seen
the hot tub?

15:31.321 --> 15:32.714
Hello.

15:32.757 --> 15:34.498
I can't bring the computer
into the hot tub.

15:34.542 --> 15:36.805
You're so cranky.

15:36.848 --> 15:39.373
What? My editor's
breathing down my neck.

15:39.415 --> 15:41.244
I mean, my advance
is almost gone,

15:41.288 --> 15:42.680
and as soon
as we get back home,

15:42.724 --> 15:44.204
we're gonna have a stack
of bills waiting for us.

15:44.247 --> 15:47.294
Honey, my website Patreon
is killing it right now,

15:47.337 --> 15:51.646
and I'm making a movie,
so don't worry about money.

15:51.689 --> 15:54.388
That's easy for you to say.

15:56.216 --> 15:59.915
I know what you need
for inspiration.

15:59.959 --> 16:01.090
[laughs]

16:01.134 --> 16:02.700
What are you--

16:02.744 --> 16:05.573
- Mm.
- [sighs]

16:05.616 --> 16:07.053
Oh, that's...

16:07.096 --> 16:08.315
so...

16:08.358 --> 16:10.882
[ominous music]
That's...

16:10.926 --> 16:13.885
Oh, God, that's good.

16:13.929 --> 16:15.931
What is that?

16:17.498 --> 16:20.283
Uh, a camera.

16:20.327 --> 16:21.719
Is it on?

16:21.763 --> 16:23.765
Mm-hmm.
You want me to stop?

16:23.808 --> 16:25.419
- Uh, yes.
- Yeah?

16:25.462 --> 16:27.725
- Ah. No.
- No?

16:27.769 --> 16:29.510
- No.
- Stop?

16:29.553 --> 16:32.295
Ugh.
how do I turn it off?

16:32.339 --> 16:34.428
[breathing heavily]

16:34.471 --> 16:38.345
Oh, God,
where's the off button?

16:38.388 --> 16:40.608
Oh, babe,
how do I shut it off?

16:40.651 --> 16:42.088
Oh.

16:46.179 --> 16:48.137
[ominous music]

17:21.953 --> 17:25.044
Babe.
Did you see that light?

17:29.831 --> 17:31.876
You're sleepwalking.

17:31.920 --> 17:34.836
No, I'm not sleepwalk--

17:34.879 --> 17:37.447
Lilly. Lilly.

17:37.491 --> 17:39.971
There's someone
standing over you.

17:42.322 --> 17:46.108
- You're dreaming.
- No, I am not dreaming.

17:51.505 --> 17:53.246
Where?

17:56.988 --> 17:59.556
Shit.

17:59.600 --> 18:01.123
I must be dreaming.

18:10.567 --> 18:11.960
Geek it down
a little bit here, fellas.

18:12.003 --> 18:14.702
I gotta call
my girl anyway, so...

18:14.745 --> 18:16.486
get the fuck out of here.

18:16.530 --> 18:17.748
Why bother?

18:17.792 --> 18:19.228
I can just hack
into her webcam

18:19.272 --> 18:21.230
and you can
remotely broadcast.

18:21.274 --> 18:23.928
Word?

18:23.972 --> 18:26.540
Shit, that's like some
big brother shit right there.

18:26.583 --> 18:28.629
[laughs]

18:28.672 --> 18:31.458
Now we in your house
and you don't even know it.

18:31.501 --> 18:32.720
[laughs]

18:32.763 --> 18:35.157
Read 'em and weep, boys.

18:35.201 --> 18:39.118
That's what I'm talking
about, girl. [laughs]

18:39.161 --> 18:41.424
Oh, hello.

18:41.468 --> 18:43.861
I didn't know anyone
was there.

18:43.905 --> 18:45.776
Hey, how'd you get him to sign
the release form, Lilly?

18:45.820 --> 18:48.127
Never underestimate a woman.

18:51.478 --> 18:54.394
Baby girl,
I knew you would deliver,

18:54.437 --> 18:56.178
and I got to say,

18:56.222 --> 18:59.094
you and your man boy
make some pretty great pixels.

18:59.138 --> 19:01.227
Thank you.
That's so sweet.

19:01.270 --> 19:02.793
But I'm just-- I'm worried

19:02.837 --> 19:04.926
because not too many people
have watched.

19:04.969 --> 19:07.581
Girl, people gonna watch
the shit if it's scary.

19:07.624 --> 19:09.278
And guess what?

19:09.322 --> 19:11.759
Might be a little extra
bonus pay for you if it's hot.

19:11.802 --> 19:14.414
[laughs]
Feel me?

19:14.457 --> 19:16.242
Oh, it will be.

19:16.285 --> 19:18.026
By the way, how am I doing
with the camera?

19:18.069 --> 19:19.723
Fantastic, Lilly.

19:19.767 --> 19:22.944
You're broadcasting
as we speak.

19:22.987 --> 19:24.859
So when can I see
some footage?

19:29.168 --> 19:30.778
Oh, shit, girl,
I'ma show you the footage.

19:30.821 --> 19:34.173
I know, I just-- I feel like
I'm, like, I don't know.

19:34.216 --> 19:35.522
I'm, just, like,
this insecure artist.

19:35.565 --> 19:37.524
I'm like...
I'm crazy. So...

19:37.567 --> 19:39.221
what can I do to help?

19:39.265 --> 19:40.657
Know what? I got it.

19:40.701 --> 19:43.443
You gonna take the red light
on the camera,

19:43.486 --> 19:45.271
and you gonna mark it out

19:45.314 --> 19:48.317
and then you won't know
when we filming and when
we not filming.

19:48.361 --> 19:50.058
That's genius.

19:50.101 --> 19:53.061
[laughs]
Sometimes it happens that way.

19:53.104 --> 19:54.802
I-- I can't control the shit.

19:54.845 --> 19:57.587
Well, I have to tell you I can't
video-chat with you anymore

19:57.631 --> 19:59.546
because my character
wouldn't do that.

19:59.589 --> 20:01.069
'Cause you method and shit.

20:01.112 --> 20:02.592
That's why I hired you, mama.

20:02.636 --> 20:04.420
I like it. I like it a lot.

20:04.464 --> 20:05.943
[groans]

20:08.076 --> 20:12.167
Lilly isn't here anymore...

20:16.215 --> 20:18.217
minion.

20:18.260 --> 20:21.045
My name is Roxanne.

20:21.089 --> 20:25.572
Now and how.

20:27.008 --> 20:29.140
Just kidding.

20:29.184 --> 20:32.318
All right, guys. See ya.
Thank you. Bye bye.

20:32.361 --> 20:35.712
[ominous music]

20:44.330 --> 20:47.202
What up,
my conspiracy realists?

20:47.246 --> 20:49.378
I am your host,
Juice McDaniels.

20:49.422 --> 20:52.512
It's Beyond Paranormal.

20:52.555 --> 20:55.558
Look, let's just dive
right into it, flat Earthers.

20:55.602 --> 20:57.604
You ever sleep
with your eyes open?

20:57.647 --> 20:59.954
Do you see things
that don't exist?

20:59.997 --> 21:03.305
Or perhaps you find yourself
lying on the floor.

21:03.349 --> 21:05.481
[Lilly singing indistinct]

21:05.525 --> 21:07.178
And I'm not talking about
partying the night before.

21:07.222 --> 21:10.834
Maybe, just maybe you're
a vessel for traveling

21:10.878 --> 21:12.575
into another dimension.

21:12.619 --> 21:14.969
Babe,
I'm trying to concentrate.

21:15.012 --> 21:17.667
Juice: Today we will look
into outer body experiences

21:17.711 --> 21:20.583
and the dangers
that lurk in your--

21:26.372 --> 21:29.636
No, no, no, no, no.
Come on.

21:29.679 --> 21:32.508
Come on. You gotta
be freaking kidding me.

21:32.552 --> 21:34.858
Babe,
did you touch anything?

21:47.871 --> 21:50.221
[Lilly exhales]

21:50.265 --> 21:54.661
Lilly meditates to thrust
herself into character.

21:54.704 --> 21:56.532
You know, babe, I--

21:56.576 --> 22:00.362
I might have figured out my
inciting incident for my book.

22:00.406 --> 22:03.365
[sighs]

22:03.409 --> 22:05.367
[Southern accent]
What you whinin' about?

22:05.411 --> 22:08.544
Ain't no thing
but a chicken wing.

22:08.588 --> 22:10.416
You got taters
in your ears?

22:10.459 --> 22:11.460
Oh, baby.

22:11.504 --> 22:13.941
- [hisses]
- [groans]

22:16.944 --> 22:22.819
This is Lilly
really getting into character.

22:22.863 --> 22:24.386
Who are you this time, babe?

22:24.430 --> 22:25.866
You got anything to drink?

22:25.909 --> 22:28.390
I'm so God dang thirsty
right now.

22:28.434 --> 22:30.087
You know we're out of milk.

22:30.131 --> 22:32.351
You got some browns?

22:32.394 --> 22:34.004
Excuse me.

22:34.048 --> 22:36.703
My daddy used to say,
"Stay away from them browns,"

22:36.746 --> 22:39.662
but I sure
do like them.

22:39.706 --> 22:43.318
Browns.

22:43.362 --> 22:45.364
Bourbon.
Brown liquor.

22:45.407 --> 22:48.279
Oh. Yeah.

22:48.323 --> 22:50.543
[slurps]

22:50.586 --> 22:53.372
Why is this thing always--?

22:55.069 --> 22:59.682
Where's that fine piece of ass
you got around here, hmm?

22:59.726 --> 23:02.816
Pardon me?

23:02.859 --> 23:04.165
Brunette.

23:04.208 --> 23:07.473
Perfect little titties
made from God.

23:07.516 --> 23:09.475
- Right.
- Ass of a teenager.

23:09.518 --> 23:12.478
Mm-hmm.
You must mean Lilly.

23:12.521 --> 23:16.395
- That your girl?
- Sometimes.

23:16.438 --> 23:18.919
No, that ain't her.

23:18.962 --> 23:21.487
Got anything to eat?

23:21.530 --> 23:23.880
Oh.

23:28.624 --> 23:32.280
Then you must mean
Miss Roxanne.

23:32.323 --> 23:34.456
Yeah.

23:34.500 --> 23:36.632
Yeah, that's the bitch.

23:36.676 --> 23:40.767
She got one tight satchel.

23:40.810 --> 23:43.900
I been waiting a long time
to tap that...

23:43.944 --> 23:48.078
Oh, maybe youse put in
a good word, huh?

23:48.122 --> 23:49.210
Yeah, I'll do that.

23:49.253 --> 23:50.907
What's that thing?

23:50.951 --> 23:52.213
Camera.

23:52.256 --> 23:55.956
How about you
shut that shit off?

23:55.999 --> 23:59.002
I mean, technically, I'm really
not supposed to 'cause...

23:59.046 --> 24:02.919
How's about I take that camera
from your hand, boy,

24:02.963 --> 24:04.791
and I shove it up
your God dang ass.

24:04.834 --> 24:06.183
That's not funny, Lilly.

24:06.227 --> 24:08.708
Done. I'm done.

24:28.858 --> 24:32.514
Oh, shit.

24:42.524 --> 24:44.744
Swear, this novel
is trying to kill me.

24:46.833 --> 24:48.878
Now and how, minion.

24:48.922 --> 24:52.012
Lie down or I'll
scratch it till it bleeds.

24:52.055 --> 24:54.493
That's some outfit.

24:54.536 --> 24:56.059
Do you like it?

24:56.103 --> 24:57.626
My director picked it out.

24:57.670 --> 25:00.324
[sighs]
Of course he did.

25:00.368 --> 25:02.457
Silence.

25:02.501 --> 25:06.200
You've been a bad little boy.

25:06.243 --> 25:09.725
Babe, with the creepy statue?
It really freaks me out.

25:09.769 --> 25:13.990
Ray, you said
you wouldn't be so judgey.

25:14.034 --> 25:16.297
What's with the scotch?

25:16.340 --> 25:17.603
Helps me write.

25:17.646 --> 25:20.127
Shut up, bed slave.

25:20.170 --> 25:24.087
Now and how.

25:24.131 --> 25:26.220
I'm so fucked right now.

25:26.263 --> 25:28.091
My publisher wants pages.

25:28.135 --> 25:29.658
You should have seen
the email.

25:29.702 --> 25:31.225
It's totally preposterous.

25:31.268 --> 25:36.056
She wants the first
150 pages.

25:36.099 --> 25:38.537
Ah. God.

25:40.277 --> 25:42.671
Please, God, give me
a sign I should be a writer.

25:44.020 --> 25:45.631
[sighs]

25:45.674 --> 25:49.460
Hey, I thought we both agreed
no filming bedroom stuff.

25:50.940 --> 25:53.116
Relax, baby.

25:54.988 --> 25:56.555
It isn't on.

26:00.384 --> 26:02.909
Do you need your muse?

26:02.952 --> 26:04.867
Yeah, where's she at?

26:04.911 --> 26:07.522
Shut your mouth,
my love slave.

26:07.566 --> 26:11.308
Now and how.

26:11.352 --> 26:13.615
- Now and how?
- Mm-hmm.

26:13.659 --> 26:15.922
Okay.

26:15.965 --> 26:18.881
"Okay" what?

26:18.925 --> 26:22.624
Okay...

26:22.668 --> 26:24.191
Roxanne.

26:24.234 --> 26:27.194
- Aah.
- Miss Roxanne.

26:27.237 --> 26:29.370
Miss Roxanne.

26:29.413 --> 26:31.720
Isn't my dominatrix name
so cool?

26:31.764 --> 26:34.070
Yeah,
more like nymphomaniac.

26:34.114 --> 26:36.377
I read the script.

26:36.420 --> 26:39.206
Not super excited about
all the explicit sex stuff.

26:39.249 --> 26:42.992
It's totally superfluous.
Who copulates with a corpse?

26:43.036 --> 26:44.559
It's a metaphor.

26:44.603 --> 26:47.127
A metaphor.
In a horror movie.

26:47.170 --> 26:48.519
Totally absurd.

26:48.563 --> 26:51.000
Are you doing nudity
in this film?

26:51.044 --> 26:52.306
Sex sells.

26:52.349 --> 26:54.438
You know that, Ray.

26:58.399 --> 27:00.531
[groans]

27:00.575 --> 27:02.882
What--
What are you doing?

27:02.925 --> 27:07.626
I'm going to make my little Ray
rise from the dead.

27:07.669 --> 27:11.673
Little Ray.
I'm a grower, not a shower.
You know that.

27:11.717 --> 27:15.198
Okay. Well, let's see
how much little Ray--

27:15.242 --> 27:18.854
I mean "big Ray," can grow.

27:20.769 --> 27:22.553
Lilly--

27:22.597 --> 27:25.774
Miss Roxanne.

27:25.818 --> 27:28.734
Yes, my love slave?

27:30.431 --> 27:34.043
- Now and how.
- Now?

27:36.655 --> 27:38.352
I'm really tired.

27:42.704 --> 27:44.967
Fine.

27:47.274 --> 27:50.277
- I thought you said it wasn't--
- [camera beeps]

27:55.761 --> 27:59.895
And don't you dare wake me up
with one of your stupid dreams.

28:03.856 --> 28:05.858
Little help.

29:47.742 --> 29:52.312
[chanting]

30:01.800 --> 30:04.063
What a whackadoodle.

30:11.984 --> 30:16.031
[chanting]

30:25.606 --> 30:28.652
Traveling astrally
has been dated back

30:28.696 --> 30:31.307
to the oldest of books.

30:31.351 --> 30:34.876
Do you think it's possible
to meditate across the state?

30:34.920 --> 30:37.400
I had the craziest
dream last...

30:37.444 --> 30:39.620
With the right incantation,

30:39.663 --> 30:43.015
people have been able
to travel in time,

30:43.058 --> 30:44.581
space,

30:44.625 --> 30:47.062
even across galaxies

30:47.106 --> 30:50.761
with other worlds
and other species.

30:50.805 --> 30:52.763
Oh, brother.

30:53.895 --> 30:56.289
I have a collection of mantras
you can use

30:56.332 --> 30:58.030
for such a journey.

30:59.379 --> 31:02.121
Oh, thank you.

31:02.164 --> 31:05.167
Like, so generous.

31:09.128 --> 31:10.956
You got any snake oil
for purchase?

31:10.999 --> 31:15.308
Remember,
traveling can be dangerous.

31:15.351 --> 31:21.531
Evil horn dwellers
can attach themselves
to the wandering soul.

31:21.575 --> 31:22.924
Evil horn dwellers.

31:22.968 --> 31:25.840
Why would you--
Attach to who now?

31:25.884 --> 31:27.276
Don't mind him.

31:27.320 --> 31:29.713
No, see,
this is exactly the kind

31:29.757 --> 31:32.020
of paranormal shit
I was talking about.

31:32.064 --> 31:35.328
- Angela, meet...
- Raymond.

31:35.371 --> 31:36.938
Have we met?

31:36.982 --> 31:40.159
Ah, no. Lilly must have
told me your name.

31:40.202 --> 31:42.596
Hello, Ray.

31:42.639 --> 31:44.903
I need to write.

31:44.946 --> 31:46.861
Ray!

31:49.168 --> 31:53.041
Yo, this girl's stupid,
but she mad good, though.

31:53.085 --> 31:56.175
Yo, IT, while you're down there,
I could use a little release.

31:56.218 --> 31:58.090
[laughs]

32:00.875 --> 32:02.094
- We're all fixed.
- Hey, what?

32:02.137 --> 32:05.358
Both: Must have been
a power surge.

32:05.401 --> 32:07.447
So we up?

32:07.490 --> 32:09.275
Camera is live, bitches.

32:09.318 --> 32:11.146
[laughs]
We live.

32:11.190 --> 32:15.020
All right, let's see
how much little Ray--

32:15.063 --> 32:19.285
I mean "big Ray," can grow.

32:19.328 --> 32:20.982
Ray:
Oh, Miss Roxanne.

32:25.247 --> 32:27.206
What?

32:27.249 --> 32:30.165
What else
do I have to do?

32:35.562 --> 32:37.042
[sighs]

32:40.697 --> 32:42.699
[breathing heavily]

32:50.664 --> 32:52.709
[breathing heavily]

32:52.753 --> 32:55.234
[growls]

32:56.887 --> 32:58.019
Jeez!

32:58.063 --> 33:00.108
Oh.

33:00.152 --> 33:03.285
You scared the hell
out of me.

33:04.983 --> 33:06.332
[growls softly]

33:07.768 --> 33:10.162
I'm just meditating, babe.

33:10.205 --> 33:11.902
Trying to give me
a heart attack.

33:11.946 --> 33:13.861
[sighs]
Will you relax?

33:13.904 --> 33:16.298
If I wanted to scare you,
it'd be easy.

33:16.342 --> 33:18.039
Next time you meditate,

33:18.083 --> 33:19.867
could you please keep
the covers on me?

33:19.910 --> 33:21.347
It's hot in here.

33:21.390 --> 33:23.392
Only it's not hot.
It's freezing.

33:23.436 --> 33:25.655
I'm hot!

33:27.744 --> 33:31.444
[Lilly moans softly]

33:31.487 --> 33:34.360
Come on now.
You know you want it.

33:38.059 --> 33:41.541
Now and how.

33:43.717 --> 33:45.762
I'm so hot...

33:45.806 --> 33:49.027
you could fry an egg
on the hood of my ride.

33:49.070 --> 33:52.117
Feel that heat
coming from my chassis.

33:52.160 --> 33:53.988
Oh, yeah. Just--
Let's just kinda--

33:54.032 --> 33:56.947
Oh, my radiator's so hot.

33:56.991 --> 33:59.254
My thermostat's about to pop.

33:59.298 --> 34:01.648
[moans]

34:01.691 --> 34:03.824
All right, Roxanne,
let's do this.

34:03.867 --> 34:08.697
[both moaning]

34:10.525 --> 34:13.312
Oh, now... now...

34:13.355 --> 34:15.879
Oh, now. Now!

34:15.922 --> 34:18.143
Now! Aah!

34:18.186 --> 34:20.058
And how!

34:20.101 --> 34:22.973
Oh! Oh, God.

34:23.016 --> 34:27.065
[moans]

34:36.161 --> 34:39.033
Oh, you came really fast.

34:40.947 --> 34:43.081
Sure could use a release.

34:54.744 --> 34:58.618
[thunder rumbling]

35:06.843 --> 35:08.367
[baby crying]

35:08.410 --> 35:10.717
Shh.

35:51.671 --> 35:55.457
[baby continues crying]

36:18.611 --> 36:20.961
[speaks foreign language]

36:30.579 --> 36:33.060
[gasps]

36:55.474 --> 36:58.216
Had the weirdest dream
last night.

36:59.869 --> 37:02.394
[ominous music]

37:11.141 --> 37:13.927
Oh, yeah?
What about?

37:20.107 --> 37:22.501
Nothin'.

37:31.858 --> 37:34.817
Welcome back,
my comrades in conspiracy.

37:34.861 --> 37:37.516
Today,
significant spirit animals

37:37.559 --> 37:39.474
and how it relates
to your life.

37:39.518 --> 37:43.217
Now, personally,
I like to gravitate
towards more being...

37:43.261 --> 37:45.567
[hisses]

37:50.746 --> 37:55.403
Embody me with
all the light and darkness.

37:55.447 --> 38:01.975
Invade my soul with
the gift of life everlasting.

38:02.018 --> 38:05.979
I am your vessel.

38:19.253 --> 38:21.124
Yeah, it's the spirit animal.

38:21.168 --> 38:23.823
Many powerful women
in arts and literature.

38:31.613 --> 38:33.049
[inhales sharply]

38:33.093 --> 38:34.877
The only animal
that moves its wings

38:34.921 --> 38:36.314
in a figure-eight pattern...

38:39.404 --> 38:41.188
...and other magical gifts

38:41.231 --> 38:44.017
include healing
and the manipulation of time.

38:59.859 --> 39:02.557
What-- What do you mean
the manipulation of time?

39:02.601 --> 39:09.564
Well, it has the innate ability
to pause and move forward

39:09.608 --> 39:11.349
and even back in time.

39:11.392 --> 39:13.786
And on the spiritual side,

39:13.829 --> 39:15.962
the tiny wing blossom dancer

39:16.005 --> 39:18.094
reminds us to cherish the day.

39:18.138 --> 39:20.662
Remember to hover
in the moment,

39:20.706 --> 39:24.405
my tortured tin-foil hatters.

39:24.449 --> 39:27.103
I think we all could learn
to appreciate the day...

39:27.147 --> 39:29.541
- Ugh.
- Stop and smell the roses.

39:29.584 --> 39:31.064
[groans]

39:31.107 --> 39:34.589
Let's all drink deeply
in the nectar of life.

39:34.633 --> 39:36.939
Signing off.

39:39.551 --> 39:46.035
[indistinct
computerized voices]

39:46.079 --> 39:48.342
Hey, babe?

39:48.386 --> 39:50.300
You hear that?

39:52.215 --> 39:55.523
[computerized voices continue]

39:57.482 --> 39:59.788
Hello?

40:04.010 --> 40:05.490
[loud ringing]

40:05.533 --> 40:07.796
Aah! What the fuck?

40:07.840 --> 40:12.061
[groans]

40:12.105 --> 40:14.542
Ray?

40:16.544 --> 40:17.937
What's that?

40:17.980 --> 40:20.374
Never mind.
Are you okay?

40:20.418 --> 40:24.030
Maybe you should take a break.

40:24.073 --> 40:25.553
Earth to Ray.

40:26.598 --> 40:28.121
Yeah.

40:28.164 --> 40:29.601
I'm sorry.
What were you saying?

40:29.644 --> 40:31.864
Maybe you
should take a break?

40:33.039 --> 40:34.867
You don't look so good.

40:34.910 --> 40:36.738
And if you don't get out
of this black hole,

40:36.782 --> 40:38.914
we might never get out.

40:38.958 --> 40:41.482
Right. Yeah.
That's probably a good idea.

40:41.526 --> 40:44.093
Great, 'cause I have
to show you something cool.

40:44.137 --> 40:47.619
But I'm gonna change first.

40:47.662 --> 40:50.709
Cool like the statue?

40:52.972 --> 40:55.409
[groans]

40:57.019 --> 40:59.544
I'll be there in a minute.

41:04.897 --> 41:08.683
[muttering]

41:19.477 --> 41:21.957
I do not believe
what I just wrote.

41:23.306 --> 41:24.394
What is that?

41:24.438 --> 41:26.527
Tarot cards.

41:26.571 --> 41:28.877
Not those. That.

41:28.921 --> 41:30.966
A Ouija board.

41:31.010 --> 41:34.056
Why? Why are you trying
to freak me out?

41:34.100 --> 41:35.971
Let me read your cards,
Ray.

41:36.015 --> 41:37.669
I'm good.

41:37.712 --> 41:39.409
Please, Ray.

41:39.453 --> 41:41.411
Fine.

41:41.455 --> 41:44.023
How about you
read your own cards?

41:44.066 --> 41:47.548
But can you read the meanings
for the camera?

41:50.159 --> 41:53.075
[sighs]

41:53.119 --> 41:58.428
They call this
a six-card lay.

41:58.472 --> 42:00.561
[laughs]
You said "lay."

42:00.605 --> 42:03.216
- Maybe later if you're good.
- 'Kay.

42:03.259 --> 42:05.914
Maybe I'll get to finish
this time.

42:05.958 --> 42:07.612
And now you know
how I feel.

42:07.655 --> 42:11.790
The first card
is the inner child.

42:13.661 --> 42:15.402
The Fool.

42:15.445 --> 42:20.059
"The Fool represents
a free spirit of spontaneity."

42:21.800 --> 42:26.282
The next three cards
represent consciousness.

42:30.025 --> 42:31.287
Flip the next one.

42:31.331 --> 42:35.074
The fifth card
is subconscious.

42:35.117 --> 42:37.729
The Devil? That's what's
in your subconscious?

42:37.772 --> 42:40.645
Read the meaning
in the book, Ray.

42:40.688 --> 42:44.953
All right. It says the Devil
card represents bondage,

42:44.997 --> 42:46.955
sexuality, and addiction.

42:46.999 --> 42:48.609
Oh, my God.

42:48.653 --> 42:51.612
That totally means that
I am thinking in character.

42:51.656 --> 42:53.396
That's amazeballs.

42:53.440 --> 42:55.050
Amazeballs?
Where'd you get that one?
Acting class?

42:55.094 --> 42:57.749
Yeah, how'd you know?

42:57.792 --> 43:00.447
All right. Flip over
the last one, Miss Roxanne.

43:00.490 --> 43:02.057
I gotta get back to writing.

43:02.101 --> 43:06.322
This card represents my future.

43:08.368 --> 43:10.631
Holy shit.
The Empress.

43:10.675 --> 43:13.112
What the hell
does that mean?

43:13.155 --> 43:16.942
The Empress card. The Empress
card is the card of fertility.

43:16.985 --> 43:18.770
Oh.

43:18.813 --> 43:20.249
Oh shit.

43:20.293 --> 43:21.816
Are we having a baby?

43:21.860 --> 43:23.470
No, no.

43:23.513 --> 43:26.038
No. Not with my career
skyrocketing the way that it is.

43:26.081 --> 43:27.822
Babe, nuh-uh. We are not
having sex ever again.

43:27.866 --> 43:29.302
You keep that in your pants.
It's staying over there.

43:29.345 --> 43:31.347
All right, just calm down.
Hey, calm down.

43:31.391 --> 43:32.784
We're not having a baby.

43:32.827 --> 43:34.742
Oh, God.
I feel nauseous.

43:34.786 --> 43:36.570
- It's okay.
- Oh, I really do.

43:36.614 --> 43:37.397
- I feel nauseous.
- Look, we're not
having a baby.

43:37.440 --> 43:38.659
That's a sign, isn't it?

43:38.703 --> 43:39.878
- [breathing heavily]
- It's okay.

43:39.921 --> 43:41.619
Look, I'll tell you what.
Hey.

43:41.662 --> 43:43.185
Let's read my cards.

43:43.229 --> 43:45.971
I'm sure they won't
even be close to the truth.

43:47.625 --> 43:49.235
Come on.

43:51.411 --> 43:55.241
This is a three-card lay.

43:55.284 --> 43:59.898
The final card, slave,
is your future.

43:59.941 --> 44:05.251
See? No, see, I told you
not to bring evil shit
in the house.

44:05.294 --> 44:07.209
Oh, I'm sorry.
I was just kidding.

44:07.253 --> 44:10.169
Honey, it was a joke.
I stacked the deck.

44:10.212 --> 44:11.649
Oh, great.
Real funny.

44:11.692 --> 44:12.998
Now I'm not going to be able
to sleep tonight.

44:13.041 --> 44:14.826
That's really funny.
It's not funny.

44:14.869 --> 44:17.219
No, but, babe,
I was just kidding.

44:17.263 --> 44:20.179
By the way, there'll be
no sex in this house.

44:35.760 --> 44:37.892
Lilly.

44:37.936 --> 44:41.940
You and or Miss Roxanne
need to chill.

44:45.378 --> 44:46.640
All right.

44:46.684 --> 44:49.121
Balls are gonna need
an ice pack.

45:29.596 --> 45:31.293
Lilly.

45:31.337 --> 45:33.252
There's someone out here.

45:42.740 --> 45:46.700
Lilly. Lilly.

45:51.096 --> 45:52.793
Lilly.

45:54.534 --> 45:56.666
Lilly.

46:10.637 --> 46:12.421
Lilly?

46:13.683 --> 46:15.250
Are you hungry?

46:15.294 --> 46:17.557
[animal growls]

46:17.600 --> 46:20.821
Oh...
not the giblets, babe.

46:20.865 --> 46:22.083
You don't-- You don't want...

46:22.127 --> 46:23.519
[hisses]

46:26.871 --> 46:28.133
Ugh.

46:31.876 --> 46:33.791
Uh, babe...

46:46.978 --> 46:50.111
[groans]

46:59.599 --> 47:01.906
Oh, shit.

47:06.301 --> 47:08.086
Did you make coffee?

47:08.129 --> 47:11.350
No milk.

47:13.656 --> 47:16.007
I don't feel well.

47:16.050 --> 47:19.706
Morning sickness.

47:19.749 --> 47:21.795
Oh, ha ha.

47:21.839 --> 47:23.928
- Maybe if you didn't
keep me up all night.
- What do you mean?

47:23.971 --> 47:26.626
- I said no sex.
- We didn't have sex.

47:26.669 --> 47:28.628
Well, then who was between
my legs last night?

47:31.718 --> 47:33.546
Grew up, Ray?

47:33.589 --> 47:35.330
I-- I didn't do that.

47:35.374 --> 47:37.550
Oh, of course you didn't,
because that would mean

47:37.593 --> 47:39.204
you're having fun.

47:39.247 --> 47:40.596
I am fun5.

47:40.640 --> 47:42.424
I'm going to shower.

47:42.468 --> 47:44.818
You've no sense of humor.

47:47.386 --> 47:51.869
I'm fun. Try me.

47:51.912 --> 47:54.567
Tell me I'm not fun.
You're not fun.

47:56.090 --> 47:57.570
I'm a lot of fun.

47:57.613 --> 48:00.834
[shower running]

48:00.878 --> 48:02.705
We'll see if you find it
amusing when I scare the shit

48:02.749 --> 48:04.229
out of you for once.

48:14.108 --> 48:15.762
Boo!

48:16.894 --> 48:18.156
Lilly?

48:20.288 --> 48:22.943
Lilly, you okay?

48:22.987 --> 48:26.904
[speaking foreign language
in demonic voice]

48:28.688 --> 48:30.733
Lilly.

48:36.739 --> 48:38.263
- [hisses]
- [shouts]

48:40.004 --> 48:42.441
Aah!
What the hell?

48:42.484 --> 48:45.226
[laughs]

48:45.270 --> 48:47.925
Oh, I got-- I got you.

48:47.968 --> 48:50.231
You know I hate clowns.

48:50.275 --> 48:52.842
It's a clown
from outer space.

48:52.886 --> 48:54.627
It's not funny.

48:54.670 --> 48:56.368
Boo. Rah!

48:56.411 --> 48:59.023
- I'm gonna go work.
- You're such a pussy.

49:08.946 --> 49:10.599
Hold on a second.

49:10.643 --> 49:13.646
You're telling us that the
lunar lander from Apollo 13

49:13.689 --> 49:15.996
didn't burn up
in the atmosphere?

49:16.040 --> 49:17.650
That's correct.

49:17.693 --> 49:20.696
And the technology was used
to travel back in time?

49:20.740 --> 49:23.221
Not back. Forward.

49:23.264 --> 49:27.616
How did the lander reach Earth
without blowing up?

49:27.660 --> 49:30.489
Well, the theory is

49:30.532 --> 49:33.796
is that Aquarius was swept
into a time continuum,

49:33.840 --> 49:36.321
a black hole
without the destruction,

49:36.364 --> 49:39.628
and it was recovered by
a primitive civilization.

49:39.672 --> 49:43.415
At that point,
they were guided by outsiders

49:43.458 --> 49:45.634
to create a machine

49:45.678 --> 49:48.028
that could transport
to another time and place.

49:48.072 --> 49:50.074
Outsiders, Doc?

49:50.117 --> 49:52.467
Oh, you mean like aliens?

49:52.511 --> 49:55.079
Wow.

49:55.122 --> 49:58.560
Now a word from our sponsors,
my tortured tinfoil hatters.

49:58.604 --> 50:03.348
"Click a seer if you want
to be seen and have a session."

50:03.391 --> 50:04.653
There we go.

50:04.697 --> 50:09.267
Ah, nice to see you.
Come into my den.

50:09.310 --> 50:11.486
We will talk.

50:12.879 --> 50:15.534
- Must be a Jesus sale.
- Come.

50:15.577 --> 50:19.277
I have a special
right now just for you.

50:19.320 --> 50:22.062
Welcome to Mystic Mama.

50:22.106 --> 50:25.065
- Look who it is.
- My friend,

50:25.109 --> 50:29.504
I see dark and stormy nights
in your future.

50:30.897 --> 50:33.552
You want
to change your luck?

50:33.595 --> 50:38.513
Give me a call.
Mystic Mama at your services.

50:38.557 --> 50:40.254
[laughs]

50:51.613 --> 50:53.963
God, that chick's freaky.

50:56.836 --> 51:00.144
This is the exact moment
I should not be here.

51:00.187 --> 51:02.276
Shh.

51:02.320 --> 51:05.975
We are here to travel
across the great divide.

51:06.019 --> 51:07.412
Oh, brother.

51:07.455 --> 51:10.023
We will travel through
the needle of time,

51:10.067 --> 51:12.504
space and dimension.

51:12.547 --> 51:16.464
It's inconceivable,
theoretically impossible.

51:16.508 --> 51:19.380
Raymond,
you should join us.

51:19.424 --> 51:21.600
It's Ray.
And I'm good over here.

51:21.643 --> 51:24.864
The power of three
is a safer energy.

51:24.907 --> 51:27.823
Yeah, see,
I'm the camera guy.

51:27.867 --> 51:28.955
Ray.

51:30.652 --> 51:33.133
Okay. All right, fine.

51:33.177 --> 51:35.614
When I have bad dreams tonight
and can't write tomorrow,

51:35.657 --> 51:37.311
somebody is getting
their ass kicked.

51:37.355 --> 51:39.487
Are you drunk?

51:39.531 --> 51:42.011
No. You're drunk.

51:42.055 --> 51:43.970
You have bad dreams?

51:44.013 --> 51:46.581
We have to sleep
with a nightlight on.

51:46.625 --> 51:48.148
I have a vivid imagination.

51:48.192 --> 51:50.324
It makes me a better writer.

51:50.368 --> 51:51.499
Oh, does it?

51:51.543 --> 51:54.241
Sometimes I dream
with my eyes ajar

51:54.285 --> 51:56.287
and they
play mischief on me.

51:56.330 --> 51:59.333
Night light helps.
There, I said it.

51:59.377 --> 52:03.990
He dreams of horned people
watching him while he sleeps.

52:04.033 --> 52:06.297
Why do they watch you?

52:06.340 --> 52:08.995
Oh, can we keep this
about Lilly please?

52:09.038 --> 52:10.866
Her acting job.

52:10.910 --> 52:13.434
So we just put our fingers
on the oracle like this?

52:13.478 --> 52:15.654
That is correct, Lilly.

52:15.697 --> 52:17.046
Ray.

52:19.832 --> 52:23.662
Close your eyes,
take a deep breath,

52:23.705 --> 52:26.273
let go of the tension
of the day.

52:26.317 --> 52:28.014
What about the tension
of the night?

52:28.057 --> 52:29.842
Shut the fuck up.

52:29.885 --> 52:31.757
Deep breathing.

52:31.800 --> 52:36.327
Release control as we control
nothing in this universe

52:36.370 --> 52:38.807
and we are but
an existential leaf

52:38.851 --> 52:41.506
floating in the wind
of time.

52:41.549 --> 52:44.378
Breathe in and out.

52:47.425 --> 52:49.122
Ray,
why did you let go?

52:49.166 --> 52:51.385
- Did you move it?
- No.

52:51.429 --> 52:53.126
What about you, Yoga?

52:53.170 --> 52:55.824
Raymond, it's normal
to feel awkward

52:55.868 --> 52:57.217
in times of enlightenment.

52:57.261 --> 52:58.827
Did you fucking
move it or not?

52:58.871 --> 53:00.568
Ray, be nice.

53:00.612 --> 53:04.398
I can assure you the oracle
glided without my influence.

53:04.442 --> 53:05.660
Okay, I'm out.

53:05.704 --> 53:08.228
- Ray!
- No, don't "Ray" me.

53:08.272 --> 53:10.404
I didn't sign up
for incantations

53:10.448 --> 53:13.494
or spiritual channeling,
whatever the hell that is.

53:13.538 --> 53:15.235
If you let go now,

53:15.279 --> 53:17.803
we may not be able
to control the portal.

53:17.846 --> 53:19.587
So?

53:19.631 --> 53:21.807
If we can't control the portal,
anything can pass through.

53:21.850 --> 53:24.157
Evil can make its way.

53:24.201 --> 53:25.158
No, Ray.

53:25.202 --> 53:26.855
Okay, fine.

53:26.899 --> 53:31.033
Can we just hurry up and
close the door or whatever.

53:31.077 --> 53:35.168
Put your hands on the oracle.
We will close the portal.

53:36.474 --> 53:38.127
Whoa, Lilly,
hands on the thing.

53:38.171 --> 53:39.868
Aah!

53:41.305 --> 53:43.220
[bones cracking]

53:44.873 --> 53:47.659
[Southern accent]
You should have thought
of that before I caught you.

53:47.702 --> 53:49.008
Who are you?

53:49.051 --> 53:50.749
Who am I, witch?

53:50.792 --> 53:52.316
What can we do for you?

53:52.359 --> 53:53.882
Shut your mouth.

53:53.926 --> 53:56.015
This is none of your business.

53:56.058 --> 53:57.321
[laughs]

53:59.845 --> 54:02.151
Time to pay the piper.

54:02.195 --> 54:03.283
The what now?

54:03.327 --> 54:04.415
[gasps]

54:06.460 --> 54:11.073
Come here, boy, I'm gonna
split your skull in two.

54:11.117 --> 54:12.423
[bones cracking]

54:12.466 --> 54:14.076
[screams]

54:14.120 --> 54:16.992
Jesus, Lilly.
Lilly!

54:17.036 --> 54:19.865
Are you okay?

54:19.908 --> 54:21.997
Oh...

54:23.434 --> 54:24.478
What happened?

54:24.522 --> 54:26.350
You okay?

54:26.393 --> 54:27.525
I'm fine.

54:27.568 --> 54:29.396
I think
you're overdoing it.

54:29.440 --> 54:32.138
You're working too hard.

54:32.181 --> 54:34.575
Just get some rest, okay?

54:34.619 --> 54:36.273
Our baby needs sleep.

54:36.316 --> 54:38.013
You're a jerk.

54:38.057 --> 54:39.798
I got a bit
of writing to do.

54:39.841 --> 54:41.713
My book needs nursing.

54:41.756 --> 54:45.325
[sighs]
Besides, who can sleep now?

54:45.369 --> 54:48.110
I love you.

54:48.154 --> 54:51.723
"His long journey
into the wild

54:51.766 --> 54:53.420
would have been
all for naught

54:53.464 --> 54:56.902
if it wasn't for
his sole surviving wife

54:56.945 --> 54:59.208
and unborn child

54:59.252 --> 55:02.255
that carries on
in light of his stead."

55:02.299 --> 55:05.737
"That carry...
carry on..."

55:05.780 --> 55:08.217
[mutters]

55:08.261 --> 55:10.698
"Carries on..."

55:10.742 --> 55:13.832
"His wife..."

55:13.875 --> 55:16.748
"Unborn child..."

55:27.411 --> 55:30.544
[muttering]

55:42.904 --> 55:46.081
[ominous music]

55:46.125 --> 55:50.216
[computerized voices
speaking indistinct]

56:15.067 --> 56:16.677
[animal growls]

56:19.419 --> 56:20.594
[Lilly moans]

56:20.638 --> 56:22.988
Lilly, wake up!

56:23.031 --> 56:25.077
[Lilly moans]

56:41.876 --> 56:43.878
I think someone's
in the house.

57:34.189 --> 57:36.496
She's not even there.

57:36.540 --> 57:40.239
You can open your eyes.
No one's going to be there.

57:40.282 --> 57:43.024
You're just gonna go to bed.

57:51.293 --> 57:54.340
My love,
the moon and stars.

58:01.303 --> 58:05.264
[demonic voice]
You will surrender your seed.

58:10.704 --> 58:13.359
You will surrender
your seed.

58:15.230 --> 58:16.580
[animal growls]

58:30.855 --> 58:32.552
Camera man:
Damn, she's super hot.

58:32.596 --> 58:34.162
Chaz:
Mm-hmm.

58:34.206 --> 58:36.469
Hey, yo, by the way, that
hidden camera statue thing,

58:36.513 --> 58:37.992
that shit's dope.

58:38.036 --> 58:40.212
For real. Well done.
Where'd you get that shit?

58:40.255 --> 58:41.779
Oh, my girl got it
from a flea market.

58:41.822 --> 58:44.738
Hmm. Word.

58:44.782 --> 58:48.481
It's, like, some weird, like,
indigenous shit, huh?

58:48.525 --> 58:50.396
What'd I miss?

58:50.439 --> 58:52.354
Where's my candy?

58:52.398 --> 58:54.400
- Tony "C" says hi.
- Mm.

58:54.443 --> 58:56.097
Did you tell him
what the camera can do?

58:56.141 --> 58:58.535
Oh, yeah,
so it's motion activated.

58:58.578 --> 59:00.101
It tilts. It pans.

59:00.145 --> 59:02.843
Both:
It can even zoom.

59:02.887 --> 59:05.193
Yo, whatever the fuck that is,

59:05.237 --> 59:06.891
that need to stop right now.

59:06.934 --> 59:08.719
Both:
Okay.

59:16.814 --> 59:19.164
See if we can't find
our superstar.

59:22.646 --> 59:24.822
[urinating]

59:26.040 --> 59:27.346
[gasps]
Get out!

59:27.389 --> 59:29.217
Can I have
some privacy please?

59:29.261 --> 59:31.393
You told me
to record everything.

59:31.437 --> 59:32.656
Get out!

59:32.699 --> 59:35.572
Okay.

59:40.141 --> 59:42.274
Lilly on computer:
So, guys, I'm off to the Con.

59:42.317 --> 59:45.799
Don't forget to get your tees
and your selfies

59:45.843 --> 59:48.019
with your favorite
Box Girl Lilly

59:48.062 --> 59:51.152
at booth 323.

59:52.676 --> 59:55.374
[exhales]
Okay. Here we go.

1:00:04.035 --> 1:00:06.211
Yeah! Oh, my God.

1:00:06.254 --> 1:00:08.343
Thank you,
thank you, thank you.

1:00:13.522 --> 1:00:16.308
Okay.
What are you doing?

1:00:16.351 --> 1:00:17.788
What does it look like
I'm doing?

1:00:17.831 --> 1:00:20.094
And you call me
the crazy one.

1:00:20.138 --> 1:00:21.922
What?
You back to normal now?

1:00:21.966 --> 1:00:24.011
What the hell
are you talking about?

1:00:24.055 --> 1:00:25.491
Really?

1:00:25.534 --> 1:00:26.710
Look, I've got
character work to do,

1:00:26.753 --> 1:00:28.320
so kill your bugs.

1:00:28.363 --> 1:00:30.365
Especially the ones
inside your head.

1:00:30.409 --> 1:00:33.281
And please have the camera
ready to roll in ten minutes.

1:00:33.325 --> 1:00:34.500
Mm-mm. I'm done.

1:00:34.543 --> 1:00:35.675
What?

1:00:35.719 --> 1:00:37.721
I can't do it anymore.

1:00:37.764 --> 1:00:39.505
My followers are coming back,
Ray.

1:00:39.548 --> 1:00:41.594
They're responding
to my content.

1:00:41.638 --> 1:00:43.901
No.
All this social media stuff,

1:00:43.944 --> 1:00:47.121
whatever,
it's making you crazy, okay?

1:00:47.165 --> 1:00:48.732
And I'm not gonna be
a part of it anymore.

1:00:48.775 --> 1:00:51.952
My director says that
this could be my big break.

1:00:54.215 --> 1:00:56.478
Please.

1:00:58.219 --> 1:00:59.612
Okay.

1:01:08.752 --> 1:01:10.710
Dr. Ulrich:
They were guided by outsiders

1:01:10.754 --> 1:01:12.799
to create a machine

1:01:12.843 --> 1:01:15.106
that could transport
to another time and place.

1:01:15.149 --> 1:01:18.065
Juice: I always wanted
to travel back in time.

1:01:18.109 --> 1:01:20.154
But this future
doesn't look so bright.

1:01:22.635 --> 1:01:25.682
Dr. Ulrich:
The cost of traveling from
one dimension to another

1:01:25.725 --> 1:01:27.727
comes at a price.

1:01:27.771 --> 1:01:29.511
Juice:
Like a blood sacrifice.

1:01:29.555 --> 1:01:33.646
Well, glyphs indicate
that only their death

1:01:33.690 --> 1:01:35.735
allows a rebirth.

1:01:35.779 --> 1:01:38.651
Juice: You hear that,
paranormalists?

1:01:38.695 --> 1:01:41.175
Rebirth.

1:01:51.011 --> 1:01:53.535
[static]

1:02:38.842 --> 1:02:43.194
[thunder rumbling]

1:02:51.724 --> 1:02:54.727
[baby crying]

1:03:34.419 --> 1:03:37.552
Aah!

1:04:16.374 --> 1:04:17.810
I don't know
what the hell happened.

1:04:17.854 --> 1:04:21.248
I was writing
and the juices were flowing,

1:04:21.292 --> 1:04:23.250
and the next thing I remember,

1:04:23.294 --> 1:04:26.819
I wake up on the floor.

1:04:38.875 --> 1:04:41.312
Is this thing
really necessary?

1:04:42.922 --> 1:04:44.358
It's to catch bad dreams.

1:04:44.402 --> 1:04:46.491
It's for your protection.

1:04:46.534 --> 1:04:49.233
Carrying the statue
to the bathroom with you now?

1:04:49.276 --> 1:04:51.104
That's what we're doing?

1:04:51.148 --> 1:04:52.845
It's my inspiration, Ray.

1:04:52.889 --> 1:04:56.370
Well, speaking of inspiration,

1:04:56.414 --> 1:04:58.459
I got some pages done.

1:04:58.503 --> 1:05:00.505
- You wanna read 'em?
- Not now.

1:05:00.548 --> 1:05:03.508
I see. So it's okay
for you to be creative,

1:05:03.551 --> 1:05:05.771
but as soon as I wanna show you
some of my stuff, it's...

1:05:05.814 --> 1:05:07.599
Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

1:05:07.642 --> 1:05:09.253
What's going on? Hey.

1:05:09.296 --> 1:05:11.646
Hey.

1:05:11.690 --> 1:05:13.953
What's up?
What's happening?

1:05:13.997 --> 1:05:16.216
[sniffs]
I'm losing fans.

1:05:16.260 --> 1:05:18.871
They're gonna
demonetize my site.

1:05:18.915 --> 1:05:20.655
And I'm gonna be cut
from the cast.

1:05:20.699 --> 1:05:22.831
No. Babe, no. Hey.

1:05:22.875 --> 1:05:25.138
You're doing great.
You're amazing.

1:05:25.182 --> 1:05:26.705
No. Baby.

1:05:26.748 --> 1:05:29.577
Now, look, don't worry
about reading my stuff.

1:05:29.621 --> 1:05:31.884
You can read it whenever.

1:05:31.928 --> 1:05:33.842
I'm sure it's good.

1:05:33.886 --> 1:05:36.802
Thanks.

1:05:36.845 --> 1:05:39.326
I need you
to film everything, Ray.

1:05:39.370 --> 1:05:41.067
I mean, no matter what.

1:05:41.111 --> 1:05:42.808
I need you
to keep the camera rolling.

1:05:42.851 --> 1:05:46.246
Okay-- Hey, I'll--
I'll film everything.

1:05:46.290 --> 1:05:49.771
- Everything?
- Yeah. I promise.

1:05:49.815 --> 1:05:51.251
Okay?

1:05:51.295 --> 1:05:54.385
But you gotta
keep me out of it.

1:05:54.428 --> 1:05:57.344
All right?
Just the camera guy.

1:05:59.564 --> 1:06:01.653
Great, because, well,

1:06:01.696 --> 1:06:03.655
Angela's coming tomorrow
for another session,

1:06:03.698 --> 1:06:06.353
so make sure the camera's
fully charged.

1:06:10.444 --> 1:06:12.794
Angela.

1:06:12.838 --> 1:06:15.101
Fantastic.

1:06:15.145 --> 1:06:18.452
May the darkest journeys
turn bright.

1:06:20.019 --> 1:06:22.891
Cannot believe I let you
talk me into this again.

1:06:25.720 --> 1:06:28.419
Oh, my God.
It tastes like fecal matter.

1:06:30.638 --> 1:06:33.032
We would like to give thanks

1:06:33.076 --> 1:06:35.513
for this special night.

1:06:35.556 --> 1:06:38.646
We open our arms
to the mystics.

1:06:38.690 --> 1:06:41.910
We open our arms
to the unknown.

1:06:41.954 --> 1:06:45.001
We open our hearts
freely to contact you,

1:06:45.044 --> 1:06:50.615
the all-present, everywhere
spirit of the night.

1:06:58.231 --> 1:07:01.147
Spirit, who do you seek?

1:07:02.192 --> 1:07:07.023
R... A... Y.

1:07:07.066 --> 1:07:08.589
Okay.

1:07:08.633 --> 1:07:10.461
Ray, it wants you.

1:07:10.504 --> 1:07:13.507
Yeah, well, tell whoever it is
Ray's not home.

1:07:17.294 --> 1:07:19.078

[Southern accent]
Get inside my gut, Ray.

1:07:30.002 --> 1:07:31.482
What is your name, spirit?

1:07:31.525 --> 1:07:33.179
Silence.

1:07:35.355 --> 1:07:36.878
Come here, boy.

1:07:36.922 --> 1:07:38.489
Babe, I love you,

1:07:38.532 --> 1:07:39.925
but you're really
freaking me out right now.

1:07:39.968 --> 1:07:41.709
Maybe I can help.

1:07:41.753 --> 1:07:44.277
What is it that you want
from Ray?

1:07:49.543 --> 1:07:51.284
[cracks neck]

1:07:51.328 --> 1:07:54.070
Okay. All right. Look, babe,
you're taking this method shit

1:07:54.113 --> 1:07:55.462
way too far.

1:07:55.506 --> 1:07:57.638
Shut your mouth, cunt.

1:07:57.682 --> 1:08:00.902
You're the blackwater leech
that feeds off people

1:08:00.946 --> 1:08:04.123
without a memory of doing so.

1:08:04.167 --> 1:08:07.039
And he finished
his Earthly...

1:08:07.083 --> 1:08:09.781
with an ungrateful
swig of content.

1:08:09.824 --> 1:08:12.000
Ow! Lilly, what the hell?

1:08:12.044 --> 1:08:14.568
Hell? Not exactly, boy.

1:08:14.612 --> 1:08:16.135
That really hurt.

1:08:16.179 --> 1:08:18.137
Could you please stop
slapping me?

1:08:18.181 --> 1:08:19.530
[groans]

1:08:19.573 --> 1:08:21.487
You like being slapped,
don't you, clown?

1:08:21.532 --> 1:08:23.533
No, I don't like
being smacked.

1:08:23.577 --> 1:08:27.799
Yeehaw! I think
the catfish likes it.

1:08:27.842 --> 1:08:29.540
You like it,
bottom feeder?

Ray-- Ray--

1:08:37.635 --> 1:08:41.594
Who's that bitch trying
to get inside my God dang--

1:08:41.639 --> 1:08:43.162
[bones crack]

1:08:43.206 --> 1:08:47.426

1:08:56.262 --> 1:08:58.960
Lilly. Lilly.

1:08:59.004 --> 1:09:01.049
Angela, help!

1:09:04.009 --> 1:09:08.273

1:09:23.768 --> 1:09:25.422
Ray.

1:09:25.465 --> 1:09:29.381
Ray,
I want to eat your heart.

1:09:29.425 --> 1:09:31.122
[laughs]

1:09:34.387 --> 1:09:36.433
Lilly:
Ray...

1:09:37.346 --> 1:09:39.218
Ray...

1:10:18.823 --> 1:10:20.346
Lilly?

1:10:22.043 --> 1:10:24.219
Angela?

1:11:04.041 --> 1:11:05.565
Just close your eyes.

1:11:05.609 --> 1:11:09.003
Open them, and you're
gonna be back in bed.

1:11:09.047 --> 1:11:12.180
[laughs]

1:11:17.273 --> 1:11:19.144
Just close your eyes,

1:11:19.187 --> 1:11:20.493
and when you open them,

1:11:20.537 --> 1:11:23.409
you're gonna be back in bed.

1:11:36.379 --> 1:11:40.077
[wood knocking, clattering]

1:11:43.951 --> 1:11:46.344
You feel that?

1:11:47.825 --> 1:11:50.130
Aah!

1:11:52.264 --> 1:11:54.571
Aah!

1:11:54.614 --> 1:11:56.355
[knocking continues]

1:11:56.398 --> 1:11:58.618
Oh, God.

1:11:58.662 --> 1:12:01.447
Aah!

1:12:15.418 --> 1:12:18.725
It's not there.
It's not there. It's not there.

1:12:18.769 --> 1:12:21.337
It's not there.

1:12:22.860 --> 1:12:25.166
It's not--

1:12:34.567 --> 1:12:36.395

1:12:49.539 --> 1:12:51.541
[gasps]

1:13:05.468 --> 1:13:07.731
Why you leaving it there?

1:13:10.210 --> 1:13:12.518
Well, good morning.

1:13:12.562 --> 1:13:15.173
How you feel?
'Cause I feel like shit.

1:13:17.001 --> 1:13:18.481
Would have been nice to know

1:13:18.523 --> 1:13:21.005
that we were gonna trip
on cosmic tea last night.

1:13:24.704 --> 1:13:27.490
What, nothing?

1:13:27.532 --> 1:13:30.362
You just get to drug me
with some strange woman

1:13:30.406 --> 1:13:33.409
and I'm supposed to be
okay with this shit?

1:13:37.717 --> 1:13:39.589
Something's been
going on here too,

1:13:39.632 --> 1:13:40.851
and don't tell me
I'm dreaming.

1:13:40.894 --> 1:13:42.330
I'm not dreaming.

1:13:42.374 --> 1:13:44.071
Got these bites
all over my back.

1:13:44.115 --> 1:13:46.770
Shit's itchy as hell.

1:13:48.206 --> 1:13:50.600
You know, every time you start
to do this method acting shit,

1:13:50.643 --> 1:13:53.037
you get all bipolar
and crazy on me.

1:13:53.080 --> 1:13:55.039
I don't appreciate it.

1:13:55.082 --> 1:13:58.564
There is a long list
predating the pyramids.

1:13:58.608 --> 1:14:01.045
Dr. Ulrich:
And I'm not talking Egypt.

1:14:01.088 --> 1:14:02.481
Juice: You're talking
south of the border.

1:14:02.525 --> 1:14:04.483
You know, there's evidence
to suggest that--

1:14:04.527 --> 1:14:06.005
that time and space travel

1:14:06.050 --> 1:14:08.139
had been integrated
into the spirit world.

1:14:08.182 --> 1:14:10.097
Juice: You hear that,
paranormalists?

1:14:10.141 --> 1:14:13.710
Aliens and ghosts
travel in time.

1:14:16.539 --> 1:14:18.496
[ominous music]

1:14:29.856 --> 1:14:31.945
Hey, babe.

1:14:40.606 --> 1:14:43.696
Need any organs lately?

1:14:46.177 --> 1:14:49.528
Some wild stuff today.

1:14:53.010 --> 1:14:54.490
Think you got this charac--

1:14:54.532 --> 1:14:57.101
Oh, characters, down.

1:15:01.105 --> 1:15:03.455
You're amazing.
You know that?

1:15:04.804 --> 1:15:09.853
I know-- I know it's been
a crazy week, but...

1:15:09.896 --> 1:15:12.856
I just wanna let you know
that I'm proud of you.

1:15:16.599 --> 1:15:20.166
Well, goodnight,
whoever you are.

1:16:04.647 --> 1:16:07.563
You're all a bunch of assholes.
You know that?

1:16:08.912 --> 1:16:13.090
Mm. Yeah, Lilly bird.

1:16:14.352 --> 1:16:15.266
[phone rings]

1:16:15.309 --> 1:16:18.008
Hey, Lilly?

1:16:18.050 --> 1:16:19.923
Think your director's calling.

1:16:19.966 --> 1:16:21.532
[ringing continues]

1:16:21.577 --> 1:16:22.752
Roxanne?

1:16:24.318 --> 1:16:26.625
Babe, you want me
to draw you a bath?

1:16:26.669 --> 1:16:28.496
Maybe it'll make you
feel better?

1:16:28.540 --> 1:16:31.587
[speaking indistinct]

1:16:31.630 --> 1:16:33.763
- Mm.
- No.

1:16:33.806 --> 1:16:35.547
I'm just gonna put it over there
so it doesn't get wet.

1:16:35.591 --> 1:16:37.027
- [hisses]
- Oh. Oh. Okay.

1:16:37.070 --> 1:16:38.942
I'm just gonna put it
right there

1:16:38.985 --> 1:16:40.334
so it doesn't get wet,
okay?

1:16:40.378 --> 1:16:42.728
Come here.

1:16:45.383 --> 1:16:48.429
There. See? It's fine.
It's fine.

1:16:48.473 --> 1:16:51.781
It's okay. Here, let's get in.
Let's get you in.

1:16:54.871 --> 1:16:57.177
Okay.
Let's get in.

1:17:12.584 --> 1:17:13.933
Yeah.

1:17:13.977 --> 1:17:17.981
What up, Raymond?
[laughs]

1:17:18.023 --> 1:17:19.504
How's it hangin', brah?

1:17:19.547 --> 1:17:21.767
You're watching, aren't you?
She won't talk.

1:17:21.811 --> 1:17:24.552
Just want to say aces
with the camera work, son.

1:17:24.596 --> 1:17:26.076
Look, tell me something.

1:17:26.119 --> 1:17:29.340
Have you noticed anything...
odd with Lilly?

1:17:29.383 --> 1:17:30.950
What you talking about,
Willis?

1:17:30.994 --> 1:17:33.910
Like, she won't go anywhere
without that damn statue.

1:17:33.952 --> 1:17:36.347
Yo, you being kind of
aggressive and shit, Ray.

1:17:36.389 --> 1:17:38.610
Okay. Yeah--
Have you seen any footage

1:17:38.654 --> 1:17:40.394
that's out of the ordinary?

1:17:40.438 --> 1:17:42.353
A phantasm.

1:17:42.396 --> 1:17:45.398
A demon.
[laughs]

1:17:45.443 --> 1:17:47.487
Demon?
Why would you say that?

1:17:48.925 --> 1:17:51.666
[water dripping]

1:18:04.201 --> 1:18:08.771
Okay. Something that's...
possessing her.

1:18:21.784 --> 1:18:25.048
[bones cracking]

1:18:27.398 --> 1:18:31.489
I ain't seen nothin'

1:18:36.494 --> 1:18:40.977
Yo, Lilly bird is okay.
It's you who we worried about.

Yo, Ray, Iotta be honest

1:18:51.074 --> 1:18:52.858
We in preproduction hell

Like, agents be callin' me

wanting their clients
to be paid more.

1:18:56.818 --> 1:18:58.603
We ain't got the money.
You know what I'm saying?

1:18:58.646 --> 1:19:00.039
The shit's Hollywood.
You feel me?

1:19:00.083 --> 1:19:03.041
Ray, I ain't even seen
the footage myself.

Great.

Babe,
how do I shut it off?

1:19:08.221 --> 1:19:09.657
Could you please just let me
know if you see something?

1:19:09.701 --> 1:19:12.182
I'm really--
I'm really worried about her.

1:19:12.225 --> 1:19:13.879
I gotta fly, Ray. Peace.

1:20:58.244 --> 1:21:00.377
for a strong offspring.

1:21:00.420 --> 1:21:06.077
After consummation,
she sometimes removes
the host's skull

1:21:06.121 --> 1:21:09.777
as a souvenir."

1:21:09.821 --> 1:21:12.432
Jesus. Why?
Why are you reading this?

1:21:12.476 --> 1:21:14.608
What are you doing?

1:21:14.652 --> 1:21:17.611
[crickets chirping]

1:22:03.744 --> 1:22:07.443
[breathing heavily]

1:22:09.880 --> 1:22:12.710
Did you see that?

1:22:14.451 --> 1:22:16.975
Oh...

1:22:17.019 --> 1:22:20.413
Okay.

1:22:20.457 --> 1:22:24.200
Oh, I like that.
Don't stop.

1:22:24.243 --> 1:22:26.505
Lilly:
Oh, hey.

1:22:26.550 --> 1:22:29.074
[moans]

1:22:29.118 --> 1:22:32.686
- [speaks foreign language]
- [moaning]

1:22:32.730 --> 1:22:35.862
Lilly: Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah. Harder.

1:22:35.907 --> 1:22:37.909
[moaning loudly]

1:22:37.952 --> 1:22:39.911
Oh, yeah.

1:22:39.955 --> 1:22:43.262
No, wait. Don't stop.

1:22:43.306 --> 1:22:46.091
Oh, don't stop.
Where are you going?

1:22:46.135 --> 1:22:49.442
Oh, come back.

1:22:49.486 --> 1:22:51.618
- [laughs]
- Oh, yeah.

1:22:51.662 --> 1:22:53.532
- Wait. No, wait.
- [animal growls]

1:22:53.577 --> 1:22:56.188
That doesn't feel good.
No, that doesn't feel good.

1:22:56.232 --> 1:23:00.323
- [laughter continues]
- Stop!

1:23:00.366 --> 1:23:02.020
[gagging]

1:23:02.064 --> 1:23:04.022
Hey, Lilly, Lilly, Lilly.
Are you okay?

1:23:04.066 --> 1:23:07.591
- [laughter continues]
- [Lilly speaking
foreign language]

1:23:07.634 --> 1:23:10.420
Ray: Lilly!
Lilly, Lilly! Lilly...

1:23:10.463 --> 1:23:12.813
Wake up!
Lilly, wake up! Wake up!

1:23:12.857 --> 1:23:14.815
Wake up. Wake up. Wake up.
Look, it's me.

1:23:14.859 --> 1:23:16.252
- It's me. It's just Ray.
- Don't touch me!

1:23:16.295 --> 1:23:18.471
It's just Ray.
It's just Ray. It's okay.

1:23:18.514 --> 1:23:19.907
Hey, wake up.
Wake up. Come on.

1:23:19.951 --> 1:23:22.127
Tell him to stop, Ray.
Tell him to stop.

1:23:22.171 --> 1:23:23.650
It's okay.
No, it's over. It's okay.

1:23:23.693 --> 1:23:26.827
It's okay. It's all right.
It's just a dream.

1:23:26.871 --> 1:23:28.219
You were just dreaming.
It's okay.

1:23:28.264 --> 1:23:30.657
Ray, it's not okay.

1:23:30.701 --> 1:23:32.485
It's okay.

1:23:32.529 --> 1:23:34.835
[gasps]
They're after me.

1:23:34.879 --> 1:23:37.490
What's after you?

1:23:37.534 --> 1:23:39.188
They're after us.

1:23:39.231 --> 1:23:40.754
Who?

1:23:40.798 --> 1:23:42.017
[whimpers]

1:23:42.059 --> 1:23:44.584
Baby, it's okay. Hey.

1:24:07.564 --> 1:24:10.523
What?

1:24:10.567 --> 1:24:11.959
Damn it!

1:24:12.003 --> 1:24:13.831
[screams]

1:24:13.874 --> 1:24:15.311
[laughs]

1:24:16.746 --> 1:24:18.357
- Lilly: Damn it!
- Maybe you're going too far.

1:24:18.401 --> 1:24:21.708
Bitch, great things happen
when you hit rock bottom.

1:24:21.752 --> 1:24:23.318
You Kubricked
the shit out of her.

1:24:23.362 --> 1:24:24.972
Ugh!

1:24:25.016 --> 1:24:26.496
You're not worried?

1:24:26.539 --> 1:24:28.628
A desperate artist
is a hungry artist.

1:24:28.672 --> 1:24:31.240
A hungry artist
works harder, yo.

1:24:31.282 --> 1:24:32.937
- Word.
- [laughs]

1:24:42.294 --> 1:24:44.296
That girl's a fuckin' earner.

1:24:44.340 --> 1:24:45.689
You gonna be famous, Chaz.

1:24:45.732 --> 1:24:48.474
[laughs]

1:24:50.172 --> 1:24:53.262
[Ray groans softly]

1:24:53.305 --> 1:24:55.960
Lilly?

1:24:56.003 --> 1:24:58.223
Lilly, will you please
come look at this please?

1:24:58.267 --> 1:25:02.923
Look, babe, I thought
it was bug bites--

1:25:02.967 --> 1:25:05.925
Ugh.

1:25:12.629 --> 1:25:16.371
[doorbell rings]

1:25:33.867 --> 1:25:36.522
- Hmm.
- You want some?

1:25:36.566 --> 1:25:37.915
Angela:
I'm fine.

1:25:37.958 --> 1:25:40.918
All right, suit yourself.

1:25:41.962 --> 1:25:45.227
On the phone, you said
he has not been herself.

1:25:45.270 --> 1:25:48.143
Yeah. I don't-- yeah, ever--
ever since she's been meditating

1:25:48.186 --> 1:25:49.796
with that stupid statue.

1:25:49.840 --> 1:25:53.191
This statue
is the God of Fertility.

1:25:53.235 --> 1:25:57.064
Fertility. No, no,
the internet said it was
the God of, uh, Space Travel.

1:25:57.108 --> 1:25:58.936
But not in the sense
that you think.

1:25:58.978 --> 1:26:02.983
It is the exploration
of traveling one's being

1:26:03.027 --> 1:26:06.073
into another
between time and space.

1:26:06.117 --> 1:26:09.076
Angela:
As if you were being born
into another.

1:26:09.120 --> 1:26:13.429
Then the traveler impregnates
their soul's energy

1:26:13.472 --> 1:26:15.170
into the vessel.

1:26:15.213 --> 1:26:18.912
- The vessel.
- The person.

1:26:18.956 --> 1:26:20.653
B-But what happens
to the person then?

1:26:20.697 --> 1:26:23.874
- Their life force is expunged.
- Expunged?

1:26:23.916 --> 1:26:26.529
However, it takes a while
before complete reproduction.

1:26:26.572 --> 1:26:28.357
What do you mean, takes--
So how long?

1:26:28.400 --> 1:26:32.187
It depends on the will
and the openness of the host.

1:26:32.230 --> 1:26:34.580
There's gotta be a way--
Like, is there a way to stop it?

1:26:34.624 --> 1:26:37.279
At any moment,
the surrogate's totality

1:26:37.322 --> 1:26:40.237
can reverse
the transposition or possession.

1:26:40.282 --> 1:26:42.109
Okay. Come again?

1:26:42.153 --> 1:26:43.850
It can be stopped
at any time.

1:26:43.894 --> 1:26:45.635
Okay, then, yeah, stop it.

1:26:45.678 --> 1:26:46.940
I cannot.

1:26:46.984 --> 1:26:48.290
Well, why the fuck not?

1:26:48.333 --> 1:26:51.554
It's up to the person
closest to her.

1:26:51.597 --> 1:26:53.338
So I-- Okay, great.

1:26:53.382 --> 1:26:55.035
So what can I do
to stop it?

1:26:55.079 --> 1:26:57.212
Do normal things.

1:26:57.255 --> 1:27:00.127
Alter her path
back to commonality.

1:27:00.171 --> 1:27:03.478
Then once the person
refutes the foreign entity,

1:27:03.522 --> 1:27:06.482
it can go back
to a normal life.

1:27:06.525 --> 1:27:08.527
Okay.

1:27:08.571 --> 1:27:12.531
However,
most are mentally too forgone
to make the distinction

1:27:12.575 --> 1:27:14.707
unless it's from
an outside force.

1:27:14.751 --> 1:27:18.494
Outside force?

1:27:18.537 --> 1:27:21.018
You, my friend.

1:27:23.847 --> 1:27:25.762
Right.

1:27:25.805 --> 1:27:29.287
Made your favorite.

1:27:29.331 --> 1:27:32.116
You know I'm not very good
in the kitchen,

1:27:32.159 --> 1:27:36.032
but I followed your recipe,
so hope it's okay.

1:27:39.732 --> 1:27:41.907
Did you try the... wine?

1:27:41.952 --> 1:27:43.910
Well...

1:27:45.737 --> 1:27:49.481
Come on, babe.
Your fans are watching.

1:27:49.525 --> 1:27:52.223
You gotta eat something.

1:27:54.746 --> 1:27:59.012
You know, you're always
trying to get in my pants.

1:28:00.753 --> 1:28:03.539
Well, now's your chance.

1:28:07.804 --> 1:28:10.197
Who's in there?

1:28:12.374 --> 1:28:14.853
Is it Miss Roxanne?

1:28:16.769 --> 1:28:19.511
Huh?

1:28:22.688 --> 1:28:25.691
Ow. Ow.

1:28:30.434 --> 1:28:32.307
Hope you guys
enjoyed that one.

1:28:41.184 --> 1:28:43.230
I got so carried away
the other night.

1:28:43.273 --> 1:28:45.189
It was all for theater.

1:28:45.232 --> 1:28:47.278
And the fans.
[whispers] And the fans.

1:28:47.322 --> 1:28:49.846
No doubt.
How's social media treating you?

1:28:49.889 --> 1:28:52.892
Like the mob that kills if they
don't get what they want.

1:28:52.936 --> 1:28:54.459
That seance was the bomb.

1:28:54.503 --> 1:28:55.895
I'm getting killer fans.

1:28:55.939 --> 1:28:58.115
Well, at least one of us
will get the bonus.

1:28:58.157 --> 1:29:02.162
And that chair and table trick
worked perfectly.

1:29:02.206 --> 1:29:04.121
I know!

1:29:04.164 --> 1:29:08.386
All we have to do is stick
these furniture pads on.

1:29:10.519 --> 1:29:12.347
Aah!
Amazeballs.

1:29:12.389 --> 1:29:14.261
[cracking]

1:29:14.305 --> 1:29:16.829
Ooh, that's gross.

1:29:16.873 --> 1:29:20.702
Sound is a powerful tool.

1:29:20.746 --> 1:29:23.139
To fool.
[laughs]

1:29:23.183 --> 1:29:25.055
- How much time do we have?
- Two hours.

1:29:25.098 --> 1:29:26.925
Ooh.

1:29:26.969 --> 1:29:29.538
So during the seance I want you
to scare the hell out of him.

1:29:29.581 --> 1:29:31.278
Yes.

1:29:31.322 --> 1:29:33.803
You're gonna grab one
of these fizzy tablets,

1:29:33.846 --> 1:29:36.196
bend over,
pop it in your mouth,

1:29:36.240 --> 1:29:38.416
let the fizz do the work.

1:29:38.460 --> 1:29:40.723
Oh, that was so fun.

1:29:40.766 --> 1:29:42.725
I know.

1:29:42.768 --> 1:29:45.728
I think we went a little far
with the psychedelic tea.

1:29:45.771 --> 1:29:47.991
Eh, whatever.
Ray will get over it.

1:29:48.034 --> 1:29:49.384
He's a little paranoid.

1:30:02.701 --> 1:30:04.834
This shit's gotta stop.

1:30:06.487 --> 1:30:07.924
You need to get
the heck out of here

1:30:07.967 --> 1:30:11.884
and leave Lilly alone.

1:30:11.928 --> 1:30:14.496
Understand each other?

1:30:18.195 --> 1:30:20.284
Good.

1:30:20.327 --> 1:30:22.808
[distant thud]

1:30:25.420 --> 1:30:27.334
[camera beeps]

1:30:34.385 --> 1:30:36.561
[static on computer]

1:30:45.222 --> 1:30:47.964
Oh, girl, those
stacked cups and plates?

1:30:48.007 --> 1:30:50.357
That was an accident
waiting to happen.

1:30:50.401 --> 1:30:52.011
Uh, what stacked cups
and plates?

1:30:52.055 --> 1:30:55.928
Oh, shit.
Here he comes.

1:30:55.972 --> 1:30:57.103
Hello?

1:31:03.632 --> 1:31:06.722
[ominous music]

1:31:17.862 --> 1:31:19.561
Hey, were you
talking to someone?

1:31:19.603 --> 1:31:22.041
I thought I heard voices.

1:31:22.085 --> 1:31:24.217
Hearing drums, too.

1:31:24.261 --> 1:31:27.090
Here, you should drink
some water.

1:31:30.136 --> 1:31:32.922
Damn it.
Oh, sorry. Sorry.

1:31:32.965 --> 1:31:35.490
Hold on.

1:31:54.987 --> 1:31:57.294
I swore I heard somebody.

1:31:57.337 --> 1:32:00.036
I'm not going crazy.

1:32:01.603 --> 1:32:04.954
Maybe I am going crazy.

1:32:04.996 --> 1:32:07.957
[Lilly crying]

1:32:08.000 --> 1:32:11.612
Oh, babe. Oh.
Hey, don't cry.

1:32:11.656 --> 1:32:14.353
Hey.
You're gonna be great.

1:32:14.398 --> 1:32:16.400
And you're gonna get
so many fans from this.

1:32:16.443 --> 1:32:19.446
And, you know, your director's
really lucky to have you.

1:32:19.490 --> 1:32:21.536
- [laughs, cries]
- Okay?

1:32:21.579 --> 1:32:24.407
- Mm-hmm.
- You just--
You just get some sleep.

1:32:24.451 --> 1:32:28.717
I think... we all just need
to get some sleep.

1:32:32.938 --> 1:32:36.638
I'm losing my mind.

1:32:36.681 --> 1:32:38.509
[exhales]

1:32:38.553 --> 1:32:41.164
[shoes thud on floor]

1:33:10.280 --> 1:33:12.064
[electricity crackling]

1:33:37.219 --> 1:33:39.744
[bones cracking]

1:33:45.010 --> 1:33:46.664
Aah!

1:33:46.708 --> 1:33:48.971
[laughs]

1:34:12.777 --> 1:34:15.258
[animal growls]

1:35:18.364 --> 1:35:21.150
[breathing heavily]

1:35:29.505 --> 1:35:32.552
[heart beating]

1:35:52.442 --> 1:35:54.966
[animal growls]

1:35:55.010 --> 1:35:59.536
[laughs]

1:36:02.931 --> 1:36:05.368
Okay, Ray, I'm off to set.

1:36:05.411 --> 1:36:07.544
Despite my fanbase,
they still want me.

1:36:07.587 --> 1:36:10.547
So, well, I must have
done something right.

1:36:11.896 --> 1:36:14.464
[groans]

1:36:14.507 --> 1:36:17.075
Ew, that doesn't feel right.

1:36:17.119 --> 1:36:19.599
I better not get my period.

1:36:19.643 --> 1:36:22.602
Ray. Honey.

1:36:22.646 --> 1:36:25.780
Ray. Don't pout.

1:36:25.823 --> 1:36:27.651
I love you.

1:36:28.870 --> 1:36:31.568
- [doorbell rings]
- Lilly: Coming.

1:36:31.611 --> 1:36:34.092
That's my co-star
and my driver.

1:36:34.136 --> 1:36:36.834
I will call you
when I get to my trailer.

1:36:36.878 --> 1:36:39.619
[groans]

1:36:42.318 --> 1:36:45.712
You know, maybe you should
go outside, get some sun.

1:36:45.755 --> 1:36:48.106
Bye, babe.

1:36:49.193 --> 1:36:50.848
- Hi.
- Hey, Angie.

1:36:50.892 --> 1:36:52.675
- Are you ready for this?
- Oh, honey.

1:36:52.719 --> 1:36:54.156
Lilly: Ugh.
Thanks for everything.

1:36:54.199 --> 1:36:55.635
Angela:
Of course.

1:36:55.679 --> 1:36:57.115
Lilly:
Girl, I don't feel good.

1:36:57.159 --> 1:36:58.682
Like, I don't-- I haven't
gotten my period yet.

1:36:58.725 --> 1:37:00.466
I don't know what it is.
But it's all right.
