WEBVTT

00:00.233 --> 00:03.153
Alicia, we can't agree to this.

00:03.178 --> 00:04.258
This is too much.

00:04.283 --> 00:05.561
Then we'll go to mediation,

00:05.586 --> 00:06.891
and if you still think it's too much,

00:06.916 --> 00:08.101
we'll go to court.

00:08.416 --> 00:10.077
I'm very confident in our chances.

00:10.102 --> 00:11.633
Can't we find a compromise?

00:11.658 --> 00:13.929
I'm sure everyone here
would like nothing more

00:13.954 --> 00:15.491
than to put this behind us.

00:15.516 --> 00:16.566
Easy for you,

00:16.740 --> 00:19.578
but since Dr. Halstead
resuscitated Mrs. Baker

00:19.603 --> 00:20.851
against her wishes,

00:20.876 --> 00:22.856
she's been confined to this hospital,

00:22.881 --> 00:23.991
fed through a tube,

00:24.077 --> 00:26.390
and hooked up to a series of wires, tanks,

00:26.415 --> 00:28.495
and catheters with no end in sight.

00:28.677 --> 00:31.502
This is not something she'll
ever be able to put behind her.

00:32.423 --> 00:34.107
I never wanted any of that.

00:34.132 --> 00:36.085
- I did what I did to give you time so...
- Dr. Halstead.

00:36.110 --> 00:38.101
Dr. Halstead.

00:43.811 --> 00:48.000
Ms. Goodwin, you have our terms.

00:50.000 --> 00:56.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:09.837 --> 01:11.877
Okay, so it's my first surgery,

01:11.902 --> 01:13.842
and I'm holding this thing
called a "Bovie."

01:13.867 --> 01:14.967
For cauterizing blood vessels.

01:14.992 --> 01:17.992
Yeah, yeah, so the surgeon,
he tells me to buzz.

01:18.017 --> 01:19.209
He's talking about the Bovie,

01:19.234 --> 01:20.960
but I have no idea,

01:20.985 --> 01:22.875
so finally I just look at him,

01:22.900 --> 01:25.623
and I say, "Bzz."

01:25.648 --> 01:26.911
You did not.

01:26.936 --> 01:28.655
- Hi.
- Hey.

01:28.680 --> 01:30.233
Don't you have patients to see?

01:30.258 --> 01:31.234
Yeah, I'm on my way.

01:31.259 --> 01:32.792
It's just another kid with a earache.

01:32.817 --> 01:35.312
And we've got 20 more in the waiting room.

01:35.337 --> 01:37.766
- You drinking baby formula?
- Oh, yes.

01:37.791 --> 01:39.831
It's all they had in the back.

01:39.856 --> 01:41.876
The vanilla's actually pretty good.

01:41.901 --> 01:42.923
Incoming!

01:43.366 --> 01:45.925
35-year-old male found down
in his kitchen.

01:45.951 --> 01:48.492
Hypotensive at 80 over 40, rate 134,

01:48.517 --> 01:49.554
only responsive to pain.

01:49.579 --> 01:50.711
All right, you're going to Treatment Four.

01:50.736 --> 01:52.852
Dr. Rhodes, can you get this, please?
We're slammed.

01:52.877 --> 01:54.914
I'm on it. Reese, come with me.

02:00.765 --> 02:03.282
Ready? One, two, three.

02:04.433 --> 02:06.593
All right, let's get him hooked up.

02:07.156 --> 02:09.332
Prep a saline line.

02:10.357 --> 02:11.961
We're gonna need another one wide open.

02:11.986 --> 02:14.320
O2 sats are 85 and dropping.

02:14.345 --> 02:15.561
What's happening to me?

02:15.587 --> 02:17.654
We're gonna find that out.
We're gonna intubate.

02:17.679 --> 02:20.586
Give me a 7.5 ET tube, 20 of Etomidate,

02:20.611 --> 02:23.193
and 1 milligram per kilo of ROC.

02:23.218 --> 02:24.078
Septic shock?

02:24.103 --> 02:25.820
Maybe, but we need to find a source.

02:25.845 --> 02:27.344
Your respiratory muscles are weak.

02:27.369 --> 02:29.449
I'm gonna intubate you
so that they can rest.

02:29.647 --> 02:31.557
Give him 3 grams Unasyn.

02:31.582 --> 02:35.063
Send for a CBC, CMP, coags, and lactate.

02:35.088 --> 02:37.199
Give me a blood gas and
blood and urine for culture.

02:37.224 --> 02:38.129
On it.

02:38.155 --> 02:40.739
There's no bleeding or
deformity in his legs.

02:40.763 --> 02:42.690
We're almost ready.

02:42.715 --> 02:45.897
Heartrate is erratic. Watch his pressure.

02:50.423 --> 02:51.980
All right, I am in.

02:58.439 --> 03:00.052
Dr. Rhodes.

03:03.312 --> 03:06.113
O2 sats are 98 and he's stable.

03:08.335 --> 03:10.195
No.

03:10.220 --> 03:12.099
We need to get him up to the OR now.

03:12.796 --> 03:15.307
I have a feeling we're already too late.

03:17.058 --> 03:21.691
- Synced and corrected by martythecrazy -
- www.addic7ed.com -

03:33.094 --> 03:35.313
Patient's spouse is here.
He's very anxious.

03:35.338 --> 03:36.501
Any updates I can give him?

03:36.526 --> 03:38.633
Tell him his husband's
got necrotizing fasciitis

03:38.658 --> 03:41.728
and we're debriding the muscle
to try and stop the infection.

03:41.753 --> 03:43.603
Dr. Rhodes, is that okay?

03:45.812 --> 03:49.015
Uh, yeah. That's fine.

03:50.606 --> 03:54.286
Did a med student seriously
just go over my head to you?

03:57.066 --> 03:58.710
Zoe.

03:58.735 --> 04:00.865
Hi.

04:01.231 --> 04:02.271
You know that woman

04:02.296 --> 04:04.071
that you helped me get
into the clinical trial?

04:04.096 --> 04:05.365
Jennifer Baker?

04:05.390 --> 04:07.360
Could you find out how she's doing?

04:07.385 --> 04:09.189
You know, side effects, tumor burden.

04:09.214 --> 04:11.135
Isn't she still suing you?

04:11.456 --> 04:13.971
I just want to know if
she's at least showing

04:13.996 --> 04:15.066
some improvement.

04:15.628 --> 04:18.447
Will, it's a Phase III study.

04:18.471 --> 04:20.896
All that information is confidential.

04:25.526 --> 04:27.236
I'll see what I can do.

04:27.261 --> 04:29.204
- Thank you.
- Okay.

04:29.229 --> 04:32.109
[indistinct P.A. chatter]

04:32.353 --> 04:34.440
Hey.

04:34.603 --> 04:37.683
- Hey.
- So how are you doing?

04:37.778 --> 04:40.002
- I'm good.
- That's good.

04:40.027 --> 04:43.540
We should, you know, talk.

04:44.350 --> 04:47.882
Yeah, but not here.

04:47.907 --> 04:49.603
Yeah. No.

04:49.628 --> 04:51.171
- No.
- Right.

04:51.365 --> 04:52.918
Okay.

04:59.069 --> 05:01.343
- You're gonna be fine.
- Hi. I'm Dr. Manning.

05:01.368 --> 05:03.188
This is Dr. Halstead.

05:04.232 --> 05:05.971
You must be Shiloh.

05:05.996 --> 05:07.242
I heard you had a bit of a headache, huh?

05:07.267 --> 05:08.439
It started yesterday.

05:08.464 --> 05:10.632
She's also had a 103 fever
since last night.

05:10.656 --> 05:12.352
Did you try Tylenol or ibuprofen?

05:12.377 --> 05:13.376
Tylenol usually works,

05:13.401 --> 05:14.948
but this time it didn't touch her.

05:14.973 --> 05:16.149
That's why we're here.

05:16.174 --> 05:17.174
You mind if I take a look?

05:17.199 --> 05:18.697
How about any nausea or vomiting?

05:18.721 --> 05:20.721
She threw up once.
That definitely concerned me.

05:20.746 --> 05:22.398
But there hasn't been
any purulent discharge,

05:22.423 --> 05:23.826
so I doubt it's bacterial.

05:23.851 --> 05:25.625
Well, we can't rule anything out yet.

05:25.734 --> 05:27.578
So you're going to do cultures, right?

05:27.603 --> 05:28.410
Well, first things first.

05:28.435 --> 05:30.202
Anyone you know have similar symptoms?

05:30.227 --> 05:32.659
No, not that I know of.

05:34.459 --> 05:36.842
Do you feel stiff or achy back here?

05:36.867 --> 05:38.905
Yeah. When I move my head.

05:40.800 --> 05:43.563
Wait. Are you thinking meningitis?

05:43.588 --> 05:44.879
Well, with fever, headache,

05:44.905 --> 05:47.285
and neck stiffness,
it's definitely possible.

05:47.309 --> 05:48.484
Possible or probable?

05:48.509 --> 05:50.070
Because she hasn't shown
increased drowsiness

05:50.095 --> 05:52.300
or experienced any photophobia.

05:52.325 --> 05:53.979
Are you MDs?

05:54.004 --> 05:56.283
No. Engineers.

05:56.621 --> 05:59.396
Well, like we said,
meningitis is a possibility,

05:59.421 --> 06:01.367
so the next step is to do some tests.

06:01.392 --> 06:03.364
What kind of tests?

06:03.638 --> 06:06.443
Well, we're gonna do two pokes in your arm

06:06.468 --> 06:07.742
and one poke in your back

06:07.767 --> 06:09.226
so we can figure out what's going on

06:09.251 --> 06:10.351
and get rid of this headache.

06:10.376 --> 06:12.469
Is that okay with you?

06:14.318 --> 06:16.358
Yeah? Okay.

06:16.383 --> 06:18.179
All right, well, we'll be back in.

06:18.204 --> 06:19.284
Thank you.

06:22.423 --> 06:26.983
Professor told me hardest part
of pediatrics... never the kids.

06:28.772 --> 06:30.682
Nice.

06:30.707 --> 06:32.015
Who sent you those?

06:32.040 --> 06:33.060
Not mine.

06:33.085 --> 06:35.955
Goodwin's anniversary. 32 years.

06:36.133 --> 06:38.558
Dr. Choi, incoming.

06:38.583 --> 06:40.838
- Got it.
- Treatment Six.

06:42.278 --> 06:45.228
Ken Gallagher.
57-year-old male with an LVAD.

06:45.253 --> 06:46.890
Called 911 with severe abdominal pain

06:46.915 --> 06:49.101
and epigastric tenderness.
Vitals are stable.

06:49.126 --> 06:50.278
Mr. Gallagher, on a scale of one to ten,

06:50.303 --> 06:51.257
how bad is your pain?

06:51.282 --> 06:53.593
- A zillion.
- All right, let's move him.

06:53.618 --> 06:56.649
On my count. One, two, three.

06:56.674 --> 06:58.874
High dose antibiotics set up please.

06:59.288 --> 07:01.843
That's a left ventricle assist
device, right? An LVAD?

07:01.868 --> 07:03.452
Unfortunately, yes.

07:03.478 --> 07:05.157
No guarding or rebound tenderness.

07:05.182 --> 07:06.132
Has this happened before?

07:06.157 --> 07:08.285
There's a hole in my stomach.
It never stops.

07:08.311 --> 07:09.926
You've been diagnosed with an ulcer?

07:09.951 --> 07:14.210
Diagnosed, scoped, transfused,
scoped again.

07:14.525 --> 07:17.213
Doesn't sound like you've had an easy time.

07:17.337 --> 07:19.241
Okay, you're gonna feel a little p...

07:19.266 --> 07:22.663
Feel a little pressure.
Like I said, not my first rodeo.

07:22.769 --> 07:25.765
All right. You on any ulcer meds?

07:25.790 --> 07:28.741
Three of 'em. What is it this time?

07:28.766 --> 07:30.771
Abscess? Breakthrough bleeding?

07:30.796 --> 07:32.608
May be a trace of blood in there.

07:32.633 --> 07:34.643
Get me an NG tube,
and call GI for an endoscopy.

07:34.668 --> 07:35.421
I want a better look.

07:35.446 --> 07:37.588
No, no. Can't I just show
you my last six endoscopies?

07:37.613 --> 07:39.543
It's still the same stomach.

07:39.568 --> 07:41.568
Well, I'll give you something for the pain,
but we have to try

07:41.593 --> 07:43.382
and figure out how to get this
ulcer under better control.

07:43.407 --> 07:45.545
I'll tell you how. Get rid of this thing.

07:45.570 --> 07:47.203
Not a good idea. That thing,

07:47.228 --> 07:49.093
the LVAD, is pumping your blood for you.

07:49.118 --> 07:51.228
Yeah, and all my problems
started right after I got it.

07:51.253 --> 07:52.741
I understand,

07:52.766 --> 07:55.029
but it's better you follow up
on that with your cardiologist.

07:55.054 --> 07:56.899
My cardiologist is an arrogant SOB.

07:56.924 --> 07:58.941
- Come on.
- Fine.

07:58.966 --> 08:00.429
I'll have cardiothoracic
down to take a look.

08:00.454 --> 08:02.217
Thank you.

08:04.248 --> 08:06.188
Man, do I hate that stuff.

08:06.213 --> 08:07.789
It's a lot worse without it.

08:07.814 --> 08:09.744
Okay.

08:09.904 --> 08:11.983
I have a feeling you know the drill.

08:18.023 --> 08:19.732
- Ron.
- Hey, Dan.

08:19.757 --> 08:21.083
I haven't seen you in a while.

08:21.108 --> 08:22.054
Oh, it'd be more often

08:22.079 --> 08:23.851
if you'd show up at poker now and again.

08:23.876 --> 08:24.874
Maybe I'd show up more often

08:24.899 --> 08:26.649
if you didn't keep taking my money.

08:27.162 --> 08:28.704
Yeah, I'd stop taking your money

08:28.729 --> 08:31.418
if you didn't touch your
chin whenever you bluffed.

08:31.443 --> 08:32.592
Wait.

08:32.902 --> 08:36.601
I have a tell? Really?

08:37.023 --> 08:38.849
Really?

08:40.960 --> 08:43.393
Anyway, I try to stay out of here.

08:44.077 --> 08:45.978
Private practice doc in a hospital

08:46.003 --> 08:47.649
is never good news.

08:47.674 --> 08:49.642
Patient of yours get admitted?

08:49.667 --> 08:51.346
Necrotizing fasciitis.

08:51.371 --> 08:53.890
Oh, man. That is a bear.

08:53.914 --> 08:55.812
Been seeing me for ten years.

08:55.837 --> 08:57.907
Good guy. I'll see you, Dan.

08:57.932 --> 08:59.772
Take it easy.

09:06.436 --> 09:09.601
Nat, the little girl with the fever,
Shiloh Kane.

09:09.626 --> 09:11.789
Her lab results. They said it was urgent.

09:12.382 --> 09:15.518
April,
get the patient from two into isolation

09:15.543 --> 09:17.501
and order a chest X-Ray and CT head,

09:17.526 --> 09:18.835
and put the rest of the
family in another room

09:18.860 --> 09:20.163
for culture times three,

09:20.189 --> 09:22.832
and no matter what,
do not let anyone leave.

09:22.856 --> 09:24.607
- Okay.
- What's going on?

09:24.632 --> 09:25.773
Get me on the phone with the CDC.

09:25.798 --> 09:26.710
Immediately.

09:33.257 --> 09:34.490
How dangerous is this?

09:34.515 --> 09:36.235
It depends.

09:36.260 --> 09:39.409
Haemophilus influenza B
can often be contained

09:39.434 --> 09:40.383
with the antibiotics

09:40.408 --> 09:42.574
we're giving her now, but not always.

09:42.863 --> 09:44.406
And if it's not contained?

09:44.431 --> 09:47.435
It can cause hearing loss, brain injury...

09:47.460 --> 09:49.048
even death.

09:49.073 --> 09:50.640
Well, I've never even heard of it.

09:50.665 --> 09:51.919
How'd she get it?

09:51.944 --> 09:53.944
Well, that is the question.

09:53.969 --> 09:55.969
It's part of the standard
vaccination regimen.

09:55.994 --> 09:57.444
Is Shiloh vaccinated?

09:57.469 --> 09:58.351
No.

09:58.376 --> 09:59.682
Are any of them?

10:01.420 --> 10:03.507
Type B is transmitted by saliva,

10:03.532 --> 10:05.921
which makes incidental
contacts like Dr. Halstead

10:05.946 --> 10:07.346
and I not at risk,

10:07.371 --> 10:10.501
but any of her long-term
close contacts are.

10:10.526 --> 10:11.992
We'll notify the school,

10:12.017 --> 10:14.168
but in the meantime,
you'll each need to be immunized.

10:14.192 --> 10:15.437
I'm not sure we want that.

10:15.462 --> 10:16.703
Mr. Kane, I think it's very...

10:16.728 --> 10:18.890
Your children are at serious risk.

10:18.914 --> 10:21.025
We feel vaccinations pose
a serious risk as well.

10:21.050 --> 10:21.806
That is not true.

10:21.831 --> 10:23.420
Doctors are about intervention. I get it.

10:23.444 --> 10:26.320
But left alone, the body has a
perfectly good immune system,

10:26.345 --> 10:28.452
and once you start injecting
it with foreign proteins

10:28.477 --> 10:30.156
and preservatives,
you can't help but change that.

10:30.181 --> 10:31.335
Right now, all our other children

10:31.360 --> 10:33.028
seem to be fine,

10:33.053 --> 10:34.963
and Shiloh's in there all alone.

10:35.551 --> 10:37.823
Can we just go be with her?

10:40.522 --> 10:42.206
Of course you can.

10:42.231 --> 10:44.974
We'll send someone in to
watch your other children.

10:44.999 --> 10:46.727
Thank you.

10:56.296 --> 10:58.113
So what?

10:58.361 --> 11:00.271
You're just gonna let them off the hook?

11:00.296 --> 11:02.076
They're scared to death right now.

11:02.101 --> 11:03.656
It is not the time to push.

11:03.681 --> 11:06.380
I will talk to them again later, okay?

11:09.546 --> 11:10.803
His coloring is pristine.

11:10.828 --> 11:13.085
The LVAD is working perfectly.

11:13.241 --> 11:15.447
I just don't see what else
we can do at this time.

11:15.472 --> 11:17.990
- This is not pristine.
- I understand.

11:18.038 --> 11:22.771
Unfortunately, GI ulcers are
not uncommon with these devices.

11:22.796 --> 11:24.460
Yeah, apparently neither is torture.

11:24.485 --> 11:26.086
I can't live like this.

11:26.111 --> 11:28.111
Well, fortunately, the LVAD is temporary.

11:28.136 --> 11:30.146
Just a bridge until you
can get a heart transplant.

11:30.171 --> 11:32.110
Come on, do you know
where I am on the list?

11:32.135 --> 11:33.929
Your heart will fail before I get one.

11:33.954 --> 11:36.399
That's not true.
There are a lot of factors.

11:36.424 --> 11:38.070
You're a surgeon, right?

11:38.095 --> 11:39.677
- Mm-hmm.
- Take it out.

11:39.702 --> 11:42.539
- Excuse me?
- Take the damn thing out.

11:42.815 --> 11:46.223
Mr. Gallagher, I'm... I'm...
I'm... I'm sure you understand.

11:46.248 --> 11:48.517
Your heart is too weak to pump on its own.

11:48.542 --> 11:50.231
The device is doing it for you.

11:50.256 --> 11:51.751
I don't care,

11:51.776 --> 11:53.693
and I don't have a family.

11:54.259 --> 11:56.999
It's my heart. I want it out.

11:57.024 --> 11:58.858
That's not possible,

11:58.883 --> 12:01.767
because if we take it out, you will die.

12:04.408 --> 12:06.388
I'm sorry.

12:15.514 --> 12:17.739
Is Dr. Unger coming back?

12:17.764 --> 12:20.812
Dr. Unger? I don't know. Was he...

12:20.837 --> 12:22.897
He was starting to explain things,

12:22.922 --> 12:26.059
but his office kept paging him,
so he had to go.

12:26.084 --> 12:28.004
Oh.

12:28.029 --> 12:30.244
But it sounded bad.

12:42.382 --> 12:44.826
Necrotizing fasciitis

12:44.851 --> 12:48.450
is what people call
"flesh-eating bacteria,"

12:48.475 --> 12:50.327
but that's a misnomer.

12:50.353 --> 12:54.014
It doesn't actually eat.
It just spreads very quickly.

12:55.000 --> 12:59.613
Even with surgery and antibiotics,

12:59.638 --> 13:04.593
once it starts moving,
we hardly ever catch up.

13:07.552 --> 13:09.894
That's what Dr. Unger was saying.

13:10.262 --> 13:12.462
Is he Elias's regular doctor?

13:12.487 --> 13:13.743
Yeah.

13:13.767 --> 13:16.165
I mean, not regular.

13:16.191 --> 13:18.702
He hardly ever went.

13:18.727 --> 13:21.677
Monday was the first time he'd been in,
like...

13:21.702 --> 13:23.860
two years.

13:24.183 --> 13:26.582
He saw Dr. Unger two days ago?

13:26.607 --> 13:27.966
Yeah.

13:27.991 --> 13:30.814
He had a pimple on his
arm that was bugging him.

13:30.980 --> 13:33.870
And what did Dr. Unger do?

13:33.895 --> 13:36.422
He didn't think it was
anything to worry about.

13:36.447 --> 13:39.782
I mean, it was just a pimple.

13:40.292 --> 13:43.349
It hurt him more yesterday, so we called,

13:43.374 --> 13:45.781
but we never heard back.

13:47.419 --> 13:50.993
I-I guess it wasn't just a pimple.

13:53.293 --> 13:55.558
No.

14:02.654 --> 14:04.654
Jennifer's nurses say
she's tolerating the trial

14:04.679 --> 14:06.127
really well.

14:06.152 --> 14:08.634
No nausea or vomiting. No muscle pain.

14:08.659 --> 14:10.336
No cognitive dysfunction.

14:10.936 --> 14:13.757
It's as good as a report
as you could ask for.

14:14.235 --> 14:16.119
Thank you.

14:16.487 --> 14:18.777
I really appreciate this.

14:23.097 --> 14:26.904
Hey. Sweet, sweet man, your husband.

14:27.158 --> 14:30.238
If you want,
I'll have someone take them to your office.

14:30.263 --> 14:32.726
No. Keep 'em here for now.

14:32.751 --> 14:34.313
They brighten up the place.

14:34.338 --> 14:36.257
Works for me.
What are you guys doing tonight?

14:36.282 --> 14:38.455
Same as every year. Gibson's.

14:38.480 --> 14:41.775
Bert orders the T-bone,
and I get the sea bass.

14:41.800 --> 14:44.104
Best steak house in Chicago
and you get the fish?

14:44.129 --> 14:45.880
It's delicious.

14:49.808 --> 14:53.112
Do you know a doctor in
private practice named Unger?

14:53.137 --> 14:54.558
Yeah.

14:54.583 --> 14:56.184
Is he reputable?

14:56.209 --> 14:58.289
Why?

14:58.513 --> 15:00.712
He missed a diagnosis,
and now that patient's

15:00.737 --> 15:02.747
probably going to die.

15:04.699 --> 15:08.608
Truthfully,
he's missed a few in the last few months.

15:09.176 --> 15:11.183
Can you pull up a list of his patients

15:11.208 --> 15:13.019
who've been here recently?

15:13.160 --> 15:16.004
April. [sighs]

15:16.405 --> 15:19.343
Okay. Just keep my name out of it.

15:19.368 --> 15:21.258
Mm-hmm.

15:23.133 --> 15:25.460
You didn't get this from me.

15:27.142 --> 15:30.129
[alarm chiming] Code blue.

15:30.154 --> 15:34.124
- He's in respiratory distress.
- What happened?

15:36.051 --> 15:38.278
Get the crash cart.

15:38.303 --> 15:40.599
Let's get him flat.

15:40.624 --> 15:42.392
He's unresponsive.

15:42.417 --> 15:43.905
Prep a tray.

15:43.930 --> 15:45.458
BP's not registering.

15:45.483 --> 15:47.999
He's wet as a sponge. We're gonna intubate.

15:51.084 --> 15:53.273
- I can't find the pulse.
- He won't have one.

15:53.298 --> 15:54.726
LVAD's the pump. It bypasses the heart.

15:54.751 --> 15:55.710
His device must have failed.

15:55.735 --> 15:57.357
His heart's too weak to
pump blood on its own.

15:57.383 --> 15:59.323
That's why his lungs are soaked.

15:59.347 --> 16:00.365
Prepping now.

16:00.391 --> 16:03.007
I got a 14 and a 16 standing by.

16:06.332 --> 16:08.312
No.

16:08.337 --> 16:11.517
The LVAD battery. He did this to himself.

16:17.890 --> 16:19.873
- What do we got?
- Respiratory distress

16:19.898 --> 16:21.726
and acute heart failure.

16:21.751 --> 16:24.124
I'll start a subclavian.

16:25.479 --> 16:27.329
He take that out himself?

16:27.354 --> 16:28.537
Looks that way.

16:28.562 --> 16:31.440
Suicide mission. Not today, buddy.

16:31.465 --> 16:34.147
And I'm in.

16:34.961 --> 16:37.570
Vent setting's AC 16, tidal volume 500,

16:37.595 --> 16:39.529
peep of 5, and O2 at 100%.

16:39.554 --> 16:42.752
- Battery's back in.
- Pushing pressors.

16:46.844 --> 16:49.498
[electronic beeping]

16:49.523 --> 16:50.640
He's pinking up.

16:50.665 --> 16:53.755
BP is 100 over 65 and climbing.

16:54.079 --> 16:56.089
- He's stable.
- Nice save.

16:56.114 --> 16:57.756
I'll call upstairs.

16:57.781 --> 17:00.310
He's gonna need to be admitted.

17:08.346 --> 17:12.462
Dr. Halstead, I need a word with you.

17:19.194 --> 17:22.093
Why were you poking around
the clinical trial wing?

17:22.117 --> 17:23.890
- I didn't talk to her.
- I instructed you

17:23.915 --> 17:26.554
not to go anywhere near Jennifer Baker.

17:26.622 --> 17:28.288
But I heard good news.

17:28.313 --> 17:30.456
Jennifer hasn't had any
of the usual side effects.

17:30.481 --> 17:32.006
She's doing great in her treatment.

17:32.031 --> 17:33.679
That's beside the point.

17:33.704 --> 17:35.631
You blatantly disregard the one thing

17:35.656 --> 17:37.636
I asked you not to do.

17:37.661 --> 17:39.700
This could mean she's on
the road to remission,

17:39.725 --> 17:41.195
and then I'm sure they'll drop the lawsuit.

17:41.220 --> 17:42.410
You don't know that.

17:42.649 --> 17:46.358
You know,
I have tried to be supportive of you,

17:46.383 --> 17:49.633
but one more misstep and
I will suspend you.

17:49.658 --> 17:52.377
You will be barred from this hospital

17:52.402 --> 17:54.122
until the lawsuit is settled,

17:54.146 --> 17:57.166
and when it is,
I will recommend to the board

17:57.191 --> 17:59.141
that you be terminated.

18:03.457 --> 18:05.789
I'm done.

18:13.450 --> 18:14.906
Excuse me, Ms. Goodwin.

18:14.931 --> 18:15.971
What is it?

18:15.996 --> 18:17.865
Um, what exactly is the protocol

18:17.890 --> 18:19.850
for reporting medical misconduct?

18:20.003 --> 18:21.875
Nurse? Doctor? Who?

18:21.900 --> 18:22.980
Doctor.

18:23.005 --> 18:24.724
Dr. Unger.

18:24.924 --> 18:27.636
Let's take this up to my office.

18:28.808 --> 18:30.932
Over the past two years,

18:30.957 --> 18:34.037
Dr. Unger has increasingly
missed routine diagnoses.

18:34.062 --> 18:35.659
In the past three months alone

18:35.684 --> 18:37.683
there have been four separate incidents.

18:37.708 --> 18:40.411
A UTI that led to pyelonephritis,

18:40.436 --> 18:41.741
abdominal pain

18:41.766 --> 18:43.816
that turned into a ruptured appendix,

18:43.841 --> 18:45.930
a leg rash that turned out to be a DVT,

18:45.955 --> 18:47.875
and now an infected pimple

18:47.900 --> 18:50.020
that's led to necrotizing fasciitis.

18:50.045 --> 18:53.035
You know this guy. What are your thoughts?

18:53.060 --> 18:54.920
We went to medical school together,

18:54.945 --> 18:57.875
and he's a caring, thorough physician.

18:57.900 --> 19:00.783
Been my personal doctor for years.

19:00.808 --> 19:02.383
Never missed a thing.

19:02.408 --> 19:04.351
He missed those,

19:04.376 --> 19:06.807
and they're only the ones
that came in here.

19:06.833 --> 19:09.097
Thank you, Reese. We'll look into it.

19:09.122 --> 19:13.000
In the meantime,
don't share your concerns with anyone else.

19:20.662 --> 19:22.662
I worry about his patients.

19:22.687 --> 19:24.435
Dr. Unger should lose his license.

19:24.460 --> 19:26.335
At the very least, his hospital privileges.

19:26.360 --> 19:28.481
That's not your call to make.

19:28.506 --> 19:30.446
Thank you.

19:38.591 --> 19:40.655
So why'd you really ask me in here?

19:40.680 --> 19:42.843
I'm starting an investigation.

19:42.868 --> 19:44.849
I didn't want you blindsided.

19:45.046 --> 19:47.046
This could get ugly.

19:50.667 --> 19:53.072
Hey there.

19:53.097 --> 19:54.761
Where are your parents?

19:54.786 --> 19:57.154
My dad took my brother and sister home.

19:57.179 --> 19:58.577
My mom's in the bathroom.

19:58.602 --> 20:00.184
She'll be right back.

20:00.209 --> 20:03.097
Well, that's okay.
I just came in to check on you.

20:04.372 --> 20:06.780
Why do you have to wear the mask?

20:07.446 --> 20:09.897
Because the bacteria that's making you sick

20:09.922 --> 20:12.625
is contagious,
which means other people can get it,

20:12.650 --> 20:14.499
and I have to be particularly careful

20:14.524 --> 20:16.007
because I have a newborn baby,

20:16.032 --> 20:17.681
and I wouldn't want to get him sick.

20:17.706 --> 20:20.952
People always going to have
to wear masks around me?

20:20.977 --> 20:23.937
No, because this medicine
that we're giving you,

20:23.962 --> 20:25.806
it's gonna make you all better.

20:25.831 --> 20:27.054
You let me know if there's anything

20:27.079 --> 20:28.703
that you need, okay?

20:29.058 --> 20:31.580
Even strawberry Jell-O?

20:31.605 --> 20:33.675
Absolutely.

20:45.550 --> 20:46.560
[knocking at door]

20:46.585 --> 20:47.695
Yes?

20:49.280 --> 20:51.280
Dr. Downey, you mind?

20:51.305 --> 20:52.544
Nope.

20:53.550 --> 20:55.390
What's that?

20:55.415 --> 20:58.361
"Ka Hana No'eau I Ka Hulu."

20:58.386 --> 21:00.392
The art of the feather.

21:00.417 --> 21:01.512
Oh.

21:01.537 --> 21:04.136
I am a rank amateur,

21:04.161 --> 21:07.346
but it's good for the hands.

21:07.564 --> 21:10.225
What's on your mind?

21:10.954 --> 21:12.873
I have a patient.

21:12.898 --> 21:14.697
He's had an LVAD for four months.

21:14.722 --> 21:17.584
Been experiencing
unremitting pain, fatigue.

21:17.609 --> 21:20.352
He has little to no control
over his bodily functions.

21:20.377 --> 21:23.185
That happens, unfortunately.

21:23.210 --> 21:25.368
It's been rough,

21:26.292 --> 21:30.505
and he is not a candidate
for a artificial heart.

21:30.530 --> 21:32.480
Where is he on the transplant list?

21:32.505 --> 21:33.898
Pretty far down.

21:33.923 --> 21:37.762
Chances of being moved up are slim to none.

21:41.875 --> 21:44.423
And he wants you to take it out.

21:44.746 --> 21:46.702
Yeah.

21:47.850 --> 21:49.856
Do it.

21:50.897 --> 21:52.937
But he'll die.

21:55.437 --> 21:59.100
I am a cardiothoracic surgeon.

22:01.068 --> 22:05.900
The patient has asked you
to remove it, yes?

22:05.925 --> 22:08.159
In no uncertain terms.

22:08.184 --> 22:11.147
Then honor his wishes.

22:12.639 --> 22:16.255
I hope when my time comes

22:16.674 --> 22:18.544
to be so lucky as to have someone

22:18.569 --> 22:20.887
extend me the same consideration.

22:32.261 --> 22:34.331
Bad news?

22:34.597 --> 22:37.655
Well, Goodwin took the paddle to me.

22:38.173 --> 22:40.133
I'm okay.

22:40.158 --> 22:41.799
My shift's over in a little,

22:41.824 --> 22:43.625
and I was gonna go to Shiloh's school

22:43.650 --> 22:45.700
to help give out booster shots.

22:45.725 --> 22:47.735
Why don't you come with us?

22:49.884 --> 22:51.983
- Sure.
- All right.

22:52.015 --> 22:54.173
Van will be outside in ten.

22:55.528 --> 22:57.356
Okay.

22:58.744 --> 23:01.785
- Hey. You have a second?
- What's up?

23:01.810 --> 23:04.540
Did you give Keflex to the kid
with the ear infection in three?

23:04.565 --> 23:05.780
No, why?

23:05.805 --> 23:07.765
Because he was supposed to get Azithro.

23:07.790 --> 23:09.570
He's allergic to Keflex.

23:09.595 --> 23:11.164
- What happened?
- I mean, nothing terrible.

23:11.189 --> 23:12.662
He's okay.

23:13.218 --> 23:15.178
But it could have been lethal.

23:15.203 --> 23:17.233
Who else was on that side?

23:17.258 --> 23:18.437
Doris?

23:18.462 --> 23:19.462
Robert?

23:19.487 --> 23:20.797
No, she was on a break,

23:20.822 --> 23:22.692
and he was with other patients.

23:23.154 --> 23:25.303
I'll keep asking around.

23:25.327 --> 23:26.893
You man your desk. I'll find out.

23:26.918 --> 23:29.406
Yeah? Okay, thanks.

23:31.610 --> 23:35.958
- Come on, girl, just...
- [laughs]

23:41.828 --> 23:43.658
Where's Mr. Gallagher?

23:43.683 --> 23:45.683
Dr. Rhodes just took him to surgery.

23:45.708 --> 23:48.366
- Surgery?
- To remove his LVAD.

24:00.750 --> 24:03.231
You're removing the LVAD?
You didn't consult me.

24:03.256 --> 24:05.575
The only person I needed
to consult was the patient.

24:05.600 --> 24:09.622
I thought we were on
the same page with this.

24:16.702 --> 24:19.254
What you're doing is assisted suicide.

24:20.748 --> 24:22.668
The patient understands the consequences.

24:22.693 --> 24:24.813
He made an informed decision.

24:24.838 --> 24:26.491
What about you?

24:26.517 --> 24:28.445
You're killing him.

24:33.793 --> 24:36.187
It is what the patient wants.

24:37.179 --> 24:39.738
It's ethical, and it's legal.

24:39.763 --> 24:42.090
I can't let you do it.

24:42.115 --> 24:44.410
Are you really gonna try and stop me,
Dr. Choi?

24:51.632 --> 24:54.732
- Noah.
- Whoa.

24:56.471 --> 24:57.511
What?

24:57.536 --> 24:59.295
The kid with the ear infection.

24:59.320 --> 25:00.717
You were supposed to give him azithro.

25:00.742 --> 25:01.484
- I did.
- No,

25:01.509 --> 25:03.936
you gave him Keflex instead.

25:03.961 --> 25:07.015
- Really? Are you sure?
- Oh, my God.

25:07.040 --> 25:09.647
The kid is allergic to Keflex.

25:09.672 --> 25:12.487
O-okay. D-did he...
did he go into anaphylactic shock?

25:12.512 --> 25:14.244
No, luckily, they caught it in time.

25:14.268 --> 25:15.955
[sighs] Okay.

25:15.981 --> 25:18.081
Okay? It's not okay.

25:18.106 --> 25:20.076
This could have been really serious.

25:20.101 --> 25:21.566
But it wasn't.

25:21.591 --> 25:23.150
Don't you understand what you did?

25:23.175 --> 25:25.753
I made a mistake, but nobody died.

25:25.778 --> 25:27.698
Anybody could have done what I did.

25:27.723 --> 25:29.129
Who sets up the pharmacy bin?

25:29.154 --> 25:30.609
[both speaking foreign language]

25:30.634 --> 25:32.674
Don't look for someone else to blame.

25:32.699 --> 25:34.649
I'm just saying...

25:37.094 --> 25:40.515
Wait, wait, are you...
Are you gonna write me up?

25:41.400 --> 25:43.413
I don't know.

25:44.324 --> 25:47.180
April, you'd do that to me?

25:48.554 --> 25:49.574
If this happens Ag...

25:49.599 --> 25:51.166
If anything like this happens again...

25:51.191 --> 25:54.991
Look, it won't. It won't.
I will be really careful.

25:57.533 --> 25:59.573
Okay?

25:59.598 --> 26:02.022
Don't worry.

26:02.047 --> 26:03.927
It's all good.

26:05.471 --> 26:07.409
It's all good.

26:17.038 --> 26:18.848
- Hey.
- Hi, I'm the principal.

26:18.873 --> 26:20.539
We're lining the kids up in the auditorium.

26:20.564 --> 26:23.374
- Here are the consent forms.
- Thank you.

26:28.325 --> 26:31.435
[alarm chiming] Code blue, ICU.

26:31.460 --> 26:32.937
Excuse me, sir.

26:32.962 --> 26:35.481
Excuse me.

26:35.702 --> 26:36.931
There's no pulse.

26:36.956 --> 26:38.756
What... what's happening?

26:41.231 --> 26:42.649
He's unresponsive.

26:42.674 --> 26:45.272
- He's in V-tach.
- Cardiac arrest.

26:45.297 --> 26:47.329
What? Elias!

26:47.353 --> 26:49.367
Give me the paddles. Charge to 200.

26:49.392 --> 26:50.532
Charging to 200.

26:50.557 --> 26:53.210
[electroning whining]

26:53.235 --> 26:55.225
Here.

26:55.250 --> 26:57.820
- Clear?
- Clear.

26:57.845 --> 27:00.148
Nothing. Stand by.

27:00.173 --> 27:02.992
- All right, 1 milligram of EPI.
- Got it, milligram of EPI.

27:06.907 --> 27:08.907
1 of EPI.

27:09.110 --> 27:10.828
Elias, come on.

27:10.853 --> 27:12.455
Elias!

27:12.479 --> 27:14.325
- Again. Clear.
- Clear.

27:14.350 --> 27:16.984
Please, please, save him. Please, please.

27:17.009 --> 27:18.268
Come on. Save him.

27:18.293 --> 27:20.270
- Again. Clear.
- Clear.

27:22.288 --> 27:24.913
Another milligram of EPI.

27:28.407 --> 27:31.407
Doctor...

27:33.821 --> 27:36.447
Oh, my God, no.

27:40.532 --> 27:42.142
Time of death 15:22.

27:42.167 --> 27:45.788
[sobbing] No! No!

27:53.216 --> 27:57.976
[sobbing]

27:58.001 --> 28:01.228
- I'm sorry, Jim.
- Don't touch me.

28:09.140 --> 28:12.100
- What changed your mind?
- Downey.

28:12.125 --> 28:16.054
Right, you and Downey, the Dynamic Duo.

28:16.869 --> 28:19.402
Oh, that wasn't fair.

28:20.870 --> 28:22.790
I still don't agree with your call,

28:22.815 --> 28:25.282
but I can see why you made it.

28:40.307 --> 28:43.102
Awful day today.

28:43.511 --> 28:46.481
So what happened with this...
with this patient?

28:46.506 --> 28:50.222
It presented as a
superficial skin infection.

28:50.247 --> 28:53.751
Elias didn't have any fever, no nausea.

28:53.776 --> 28:56.030
He certainly didn't
manifest any risk factors

28:56.055 --> 28:59.330
for necrotizing fasciitis.

28:59.519 --> 29:04.483
He was nondiabetic, not in renal failure.

29:05.002 --> 29:07.826
So I gave him an oral Doxy,

29:07.851 --> 29:09.765
and I sent him on his way.

29:12.217 --> 29:15.703
I misdiagnosed him.

29:15.907 --> 29:18.159
I feel like hell.

29:18.184 --> 29:21.350
Hey, everybody makes mistakes,

29:21.376 --> 29:23.016
but tell me if I'm wrong.

29:23.041 --> 29:27.221
Maybe you didn't used to make so many?

29:27.464 --> 29:31.294
Our own little morbidity immortality, huh?

29:32.693 --> 29:36.615
Dan, I see upwards of 50
patients a day now.

29:36.640 --> 29:37.499
I can't cut back.

29:37.524 --> 29:40.038
Between the lousy
reimbursements and my overhead,

29:40.063 --> 29:42.023
I need that many just to stay afloat,

29:42.048 --> 29:43.088
and then there's the paperwork.

29:43.113 --> 29:46.193
I had to hire two people
just to deal with it.

29:46.218 --> 29:47.806
Health care bureaucracy.

29:47.831 --> 29:50.351
I mean,
it's tough on both the patient and the doc.

29:50.376 --> 29:53.336
You know, when a young person

29:53.361 --> 29:56.321
comes and they ask me,
"Should I go into medicine?"

29:56.346 --> 29:58.366
you know what I tell them?

29:58.391 --> 29:59.799
No way.

29:59.824 --> 30:02.734
Go get an MBA and enjoy your life.

30:16.446 --> 30:18.624
That didn't hurt, did it?

30:21.007 --> 30:23.168
Oh, you are so brave.

30:23.193 --> 30:25.183
- Was that the shot?
- Nope.

30:25.208 --> 30:27.695
That's just the alcohol to
make sure your arm is clean.

30:28.783 --> 30:30.551
- Is that the shot?
- Nope.

30:30.575 --> 30:32.311
I'm gonna give it to you on
the count of three, okay?

30:32.336 --> 30:34.105
One, two...

30:35.140 --> 30:37.100
Where's three?

30:37.125 --> 30:39.632
That's it. You got the shot.

30:41.018 --> 30:43.757
Mrs. Schroeder's not feeling well.

30:44.985 --> 30:46.718
Have your teacher call 911,

30:46.743 --> 30:48.115
and tell the other doctor I need him.

30:48.140 --> 30:49.612
Can you breathe?

31:01.512 --> 31:03.251
Natalie!

31:03.276 --> 31:05.004
Epiglottitis. Airway's blocked.

31:05.029 --> 31:07.947
Mouth-to-mouth isn't working.
Get me something.

31:18.407 --> 31:20.597
[gasps]

31:22.001 --> 31:24.167
Help me hold her hands down.

31:24.192 --> 31:26.052
Hurry.

31:27.192 --> 31:29.212
Natalie, here.

31:30.624 --> 31:32.996
I know it's hard,

31:33.021 --> 31:35.971
but try slow even breaths, okay?

31:35.996 --> 31:37.986
Mouth-to-mouth? She's type B, Natalie.

31:38.011 --> 31:39.917
- What were you thinking?
- I had to do something.

31:39.942 --> 31:42.962
[sirens wailing]

31:42.987 --> 31:46.378
The ambulance is on its way.
You're gonna be okay.

31:56.287 --> 31:58.131
Theresa Schroeder. Haemophilus influenza B.

31:58.156 --> 31:59.290
Criched her in the field.

31:59.314 --> 32:00.994
The ENT is waiting for you in trauma three.

32:01.019 --> 32:02.467
All right.

32:02.527 --> 32:04.922
Terry? Shiloh's teacher?

32:04.947 --> 32:06.690
This is what happens
when you don't vaccinate.

32:06.715 --> 32:08.347
You don't know that this
was Shiloh's fault.

32:08.371 --> 32:10.273
That lady almost died,
and she may have infected

32:10.298 --> 32:12.198
my friend, who has a newborn baby.

32:12.223 --> 32:13.983
Terry's probably sick
because her immune system

32:14.008 --> 32:15.426
is shot from a lifetime of vaccinations.

32:15.450 --> 32:16.296
That's ridiculous.

32:16.321 --> 32:17.888
You docs, you think you know it all.

32:17.913 --> 32:19.431
How... how many times you been wrong?

32:19.456 --> 32:21.466
Urine therapy? Radium for diarrhea?

32:21.491 --> 32:24.411
How many approved drugs
need to be pulled every year

32:24.436 --> 32:25.536
'cause they're killing people?

32:25.561 --> 32:27.439
Fen-phen or Vioxx, Raptiva.

32:27.464 --> 32:29.033
There's no evidence the HIB vaccine

32:29.058 --> 32:30.068
has any negative side effects.

32:30.093 --> 32:31.051
How can you be sure?

32:31.076 --> 32:32.835
Kids get the vaccine when they're babies.

32:32.860 --> 32:34.366
Who knows what the
long-term effects will be?

32:34.391 --> 32:36.082
For Shiloh's long-term health
and happiness,

32:36.107 --> 32:37.386
we'll risk a treatable childhood illness.

32:37.410 --> 32:39.345
So no child should be vaccinated, right?

32:39.370 --> 32:40.515
You want your kids in a school

32:40.540 --> 32:42.751
where no one's protected from polio,
smallpox.

32:42.776 --> 32:44.160
- Will, enough.
- No.

32:44.185 --> 32:46.105
You trot out this pseudoscience,

32:46.130 --> 32:47.718
but what you really want
is for every other kid

32:47.743 --> 32:50.113
to be vaccinated so yours can be safe.

32:57.396 --> 32:59.587
He has no right to speak to us like that.

32:59.612 --> 33:01.249
You're right,
he shouldn't have spoken to you that way.

33:01.274 --> 33:02.968
I'm very sorry.

33:07.624 --> 33:08.917
Hey.

33:08.941 --> 33:10.648
You know they're never gonna vaccinate

33:10.673 --> 33:12.158
their other kids after that, right?

33:12.183 --> 33:13.273
I know.

33:14.253 --> 33:16.143
I know.

33:16.168 --> 33:18.118
I shouldn't have shot my mouth off.

33:20.807 --> 33:23.068
It was because of me, wasn't it?

33:23.661 --> 33:25.671
Because I was exposed.

33:26.856 --> 33:28.756
I think it was very gallant.

33:30.387 --> 33:32.227
You do?

33:35.047 --> 33:37.898
Maybe we should talk about that kiss.

33:38.640 --> 33:40.897
You asked why I treat you so badly,

33:40.922 --> 33:42.482
why I say things

33:42.507 --> 33:45.136
I wouldn't say to anybody else.

33:45.631 --> 33:49.481
I'm like a little kid
with a crush on a girl,

33:49.506 --> 33:50.586
so what does he do?

33:50.611 --> 33:52.631
He pulls her pigtails.

33:57.375 --> 33:59.839
Look, I understand if you
don't feel the same way.

33:59.864 --> 34:02.902
No. Listen, pl... please.

34:02.927 --> 34:05.639
I don't know what I would do without you.

34:07.198 --> 34:09.764
But there is just so much in my life

34:09.790 --> 34:11.306
that I haven't figured out yet.

34:11.331 --> 34:13.395
You don't have to explain, Natalie; I...
I... I get it.

34:13.418 --> 34:15.641
No, I don't...  I don't think you do.

34:15.668 --> 34:17.963
I am not trying to let you down gently

34:17.987 --> 34:19.505
or put you off.

34:19.531 --> 34:22.531
I'm just not in that place yet.

34:26.291 --> 34:28.291
Okay.

34:31.114 --> 34:33.391
I'm gonna go check on the teacher.

34:33.415 --> 34:35.163
You should get a booster.

34:35.188 --> 34:37.088
Okay.

34:41.495 --> 34:44.495
[electronic beeping]

35:10.397 --> 35:14.407
[sustained beep]

36:04.007 --> 36:07.013
I'm sorry, Dr. Unger.
I didn't have a choice.

36:07.039 --> 36:10.009
I'll need your hospital ID.

36:26.774 --> 36:28.784
Okay.

36:58.287 --> 37:00.367
It's not hard to make a still.
It's basic chem.

37:00.392 --> 37:02.372
Noah?

37:04.504 --> 37:05.607
Hey.

37:05.632 --> 37:07.127
I just wanted you to know

37:07.152 --> 37:09.071
that I am gonna file an incident report.

37:09.096 --> 37:12.036
What's going on?
Is someone making you do this?

37:12.061 --> 37:13.980
No, no. It's my decision.

37:15.312 --> 37:17.352
Seriously?

37:17.377 --> 37:19.497
Yeah.

37:19.737 --> 37:21.607
Hey, hey, look, look.

37:21.632 --> 37:24.260
I get it. I screwed up.

37:24.285 --> 37:27.522
But you're supposed to be here for me,
not dime me out.

37:29.342 --> 37:30.693
[scoffs]

37:30.718 --> 37:33.568
You know what? You... you're just pissed

37:33.593 --> 37:36.401
because I'm the doctor and you're not.

37:36.426 --> 37:39.486
Noah, you are my brother, and I love you...

37:39.511 --> 37:42.587
- Mm.
- But you need to grow up.

37:42.612 --> 37:45.495
Look at me. If you're gonna be a doctor,

37:45.519 --> 37:48.836
I want you to be a good one.

38:02.097 --> 38:05.137
Dr. Halstead, what are you doing?

38:05.162 --> 38:09.092
Agh, car wouldn't start. Waiting on a tow.

38:09.117 --> 38:13.117
Ah, always a perfect way to end the day.

38:13.142 --> 38:14.710
- Yeah.
- Mm.

38:14.735 --> 38:16.184
Ms. Goodwin?

38:17.060 --> 38:19.288
I'm sorry I've been so much trouble.

38:20.714 --> 38:22.160
Yes, Dr. Halstead.

38:22.185 --> 38:25.215
You have been a monumental pain in the ass.

38:25.240 --> 38:27.090
- I know.
- Good.

38:28.058 --> 38:31.038
Oh, and congratulations
on your anniversary.

38:31.063 --> 38:32.193
Thank you.

38:32.218 --> 38:33.889
I heard you've been married a long time.

38:33.914 --> 38:35.004
I have.

38:36.482 --> 38:38.362
How do you do that?

38:38.387 --> 38:40.710
Stay out of each other's way

38:41.220 --> 38:44.260
and never forget an anniversary.

38:44.285 --> 38:45.407
Good night.

38:45.432 --> 38:46.512
Good night.

38:56.099 --> 38:59.019
That was...

38:59.044 --> 39:00.694
Whew.

39:00.719 --> 39:03.022
It was a rough day.

39:11.624 --> 39:14.124
I have something to show you.

39:22.672 --> 39:24.373
[grunts]

39:26.034 --> 39:28.976
Johns Hopkins, huh?

39:30.493 --> 39:32.433
Head of trauma.

39:32.613 --> 39:34.091
That's quite an offer.

39:34.116 --> 39:35.966
Yeah, it is.

39:36.583 --> 39:39.733
I hope you let them down gently.

39:49.445 --> 39:52.827
You know, Baltimore gets very cold too.

39:55.330 --> 39:57.359
I know.

40:11.765 --> 40:13.780
Looks like we had the same kind of day.

40:14.765 --> 40:16.765
Sweet and strong, please.

40:20.330 --> 40:23.350
I had a patient who wanted
his LVAD removed.

40:23.514 --> 40:25.574
He got what he wanted.

40:25.599 --> 40:27.439
Now he's dead.

40:28.390 --> 40:30.230
Huh.

40:31.350 --> 40:36.726
I guess I took out an LVAD myself today.

40:39.115 --> 40:41.499
How do we ever know what
we're doing is right?

40:41.524 --> 40:43.546
It's tricky.

40:43.880 --> 40:45.802
I mean,
the first part of the Hippocratic Oath

40:45.827 --> 40:46.601
is clear, right?

40:46.626 --> 40:47.736
"Do no harm."

40:47.761 --> 40:49.771
Then it goes on to say,

40:49.796 --> 40:53.468
"I will remember that
there is art to medicine

40:53.493 --> 40:55.265
as well as science."

40:57.924 --> 40:59.632
So it's tricky.

41:00.584 --> 41:03.139
It ever get any easier?

41:04.187 --> 41:05.632
Hope so.

41:05.690 --> 41:06.750
[glasses clink]

41:07.305 --> 41:13.244
