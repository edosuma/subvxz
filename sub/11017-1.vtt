to try to change a person.

as this one here, I could be persuaded.

24:08.780 --> 24:10.698
I expect I am.

24:11.575 --> 24:15.786
Just walk up to 'em real steady, though.
We got nothin' to lose.

24:15.871 --> 24:17.329
Yeah.

24:17.414 --> 24:21.250
Now you let me do the talkin', Bob.
You got that?

24:23.086 --> 24:27.047
- Say, do I look OK?
- You look fine, Charlie.

24:35.765 --> 24:36.932
Are you Frank James?

24:38.310 --> 24:42.771
- Who wants to know?
- Charlie Ford and his brother Bob.

24:42.856 --> 24:44.982
What the hell are you boys doin' here?

24:46.693 --> 24:50.571
- We wanna join up.
- We heard you were lookin' for new men.

24:50.655 --> 24:53.282
Yeah? Where'd you hear it from?

24:53.366 --> 24:55.451
Your brother.

24:57.871 --> 24:59.580
There ain't a horse we can't ride,

24:59.664 --> 25:03.709
a target we can't hit
or a bank we can't rob.

25:06.421 --> 25:10.090
You know how it is.
It was there. It seemed easy.

25:10.175 --> 25:13.093
We just hauled out our guns
and made off with it.

25:13.178 --> 25:15.387
Up in Joplin, it was.

25:16.765 --> 25:18.933
They chased us for two days.

25:20.018 --> 25:23.771
And you know how it is,
bein' out on the trail an' all.

25:31.655 --> 25:34.698
We only been out once,
but we're willin'.

25:38.954 --> 25:40.663
Frank, what the hell
were we talkin' about?

25:40.747 --> 25:42.414
You know...

26:32.382 --> 26:34.216
(Belle) Hey, Coleman Younger!

26:41.016 --> 26:42.725
Come on over here and say hello.

26:57.532 --> 26:59.116
Evenin', ma'am.

27:00.076 --> 27:02.745
Looks like everybody's havin'
a real good time at this affair.

27:03.955 --> 27:06.457
Well, I expect so.

27:07.584 --> 27:09.627
Free drinks an' food an' all.

27:11.379 --> 27:13.088
How come I wasn't invited?

27:14.382 --> 27:16.133
Because you're a whore.

27:21.848 --> 27:24.224
Yeah, well,
at least I ain't a cheap one.

27:28.188 --> 27:29.730
Yah!

27:35.070 --> 27:36.779
(# lively jig)

28:03.223 --> 28:05.933
- See ya later, Jess.
- See ya, Jim.

28:13.316 --> 28:16.360
Ain't gonna be too long,
that'll be you and me, eh, Beth?

28:17.320 --> 28:18.362
I reckon.

28:32.460 --> 28:34.712
I got a question for ya.

28:34.796 --> 28:36.714
Fire away, Frank.

28:36.798 --> 28:39.466
Fire away and fall back.

28:43.179 --> 28:44.888
Have you ever been in love?

28:46.641 --> 28:49.518
Oh, God... Yeah.

28:50.520 --> 28:53.480
It's terrible. An affliction.

28:53.565 --> 28:56.442
Really miserable. Nothin' but trouble.

28:56.526 --> 28:59.027
It drove me crazy.

28:59.112 --> 29:02.156
- That bad, really?
- Yeah.

29:04.325 --> 29:06.160
She is wonderful.

30:31.204 --> 30:34.581
- What the hell are you aimin' to do?
- I ain't aimin'. I'm doin' it.

30:40.547 --> 30:41.839
(shriek)

30:44.592 --> 30:49.054
- Who are ya? Jesse James?
- Hell, no. I'm Bob Younger.

30:49.138 --> 30:53.100
Jesse James rides with the Youngers.
Now stop the damn train.

30:59.023 --> 31:00.274
Don't worry.

31:00.358 --> 31:03.402
We're just takin' a permanent loan
from the Rock Island payroll.

31:37.645 --> 31:39.479
Yee-ha!

31:40.481 --> 31:42.190
(shouting and whooping)

31:47.322 --> 31:50.657
The Pinkerton company,
with the Union Pacific Railroad,...

31:50.742 --> 31:54.745
..is offering a reward of $5,000 for
information leading to the arrest..

31:54.829 --> 31:56.997
..of any member
of the James-Younger gang.

32:08.843 --> 32:11.053
- Mr. Rixley?
- That's right.

32:11.137 --> 32:14.973
Carl Reddick. New York Herald sent me
to cover the story of the Younger gang.

32:15.934 --> 32:17.726
You might say I'm interested
in the same thing, Mr. Reddick.

32:19.145 --> 32:21.063
What do you think your chances are
of bringin' 'em in?

32:22.398 --> 32:24.191
That's an amazingly stupid question.

32:56.349 --> 32:58.225
I want your sons, Mrs. Samuel.

32:58.309 --> 33:02.145
- What do you want 'em for?
- For robbin' banks and trains, ma'am.

33:02.230 --> 33:05.440
Well, you Yankees can just
turn around and head on back.

33:05.525 --> 33:07.859
Sounds like you got
the wrong James family.

33:07.944 --> 33:12.739
Yes, ma'am. I am a Yankee and
a city man. But these men are southern.

33:12.824 --> 33:17.411
- They were with the Stars and Bars.
- So what are they chasin' my boys for?

33:17.495 --> 33:21.707
They steal, ma'am. I'm gonna
have to go in there and look for 'em.

33:21.791 --> 33:23.667
This paper gives me
the right to do that.

33:30.174 --> 33:33.176
Things have come to a pretty place
when a widow woman...

33:33.261 --> 33:35.762
..with a 15-year-old
backward baby boy...

33:35.847 --> 33:38.598
..gets treated like this
and they call it legal!

33:38.683 --> 33:40.642
I am sorry, ma'am.

33:46.482 --> 33:48.442
How come I never been asked?

33:49.318 --> 33:51.611
Maybe you ain't cut out for it.

33:52.447 --> 33:54.740
Besides, we got enough hands
the way it is.

33:54.824 --> 33:58.702
Keep me in mind. I can rob banks as
good as the Millers or your brother Bob.

33:58.786 --> 34:01.121
- Ain't nothin' to it.
- Think so?

34:01.205 --> 34:06.209
What's to know about robbin' a bank?
You ride into town, guns blazin',...

34:06.294 --> 34:09.420
..scarin' the Jesus
out of everyone until they're frozen,...

34:09.505 --> 34:12.841
..ride right in the bank on your horse,
dynamite the safe...

34:12.925 --> 34:14.551
..and ride off with the loot,
hootin' an' hollerin'...

34:14.635 --> 34:16.469
..the same damn way you came in.

34:37.742 --> 34:38.742
Good afternoon.

34:39.869 --> 34:41.286
Afternoon.

34:45.166 --> 34:47.250
What's the trouble, friend?

34:48.920 --> 34:53.297
No trouble. We're looking for
the Youngers. Do you know them?

34:56.094 --> 34:57.094
Sure I do.

34:58.179 --> 34:59.930
A lot of 'em around these parts.

35:00.014 --> 35:02.182
Big family.

35:03.476 --> 35:06.561
- Who are you fellas?
- Come here to buy cattle.

35:10.441 --> 35:11.858
This ain't Texas.

35:13.528 --> 35:15.070
What about the Youngers?

35:16.197 --> 35:20.450
You're lookin' at two of 'em.
You ain't here to buy cattle.

35:20.535 --> 35:22.202
Now who are you fellas?

35:23.204 --> 35:25.455
Goddamn Pinkertons!

35:26.457 --> 35:29.835
- Which Younger are you?
- Question is, who are you?

35:30.920 --> 35:34.131
I told ya. We're cattle buyers.

35:34.215 --> 35:37.884
How dumb do you think we are?
You're Pinkerton men!

35:37.969 --> 35:40.679
I'm Jim Younger.
This here's my cousin John.

35:40.763 --> 35:42.597
You ain't lookin' for him.
He don't ride with us.

35:44.225 --> 35:45.642
Is that right?

36:06.664 --> 36:08.540
Go! Ha!

36:26.767 --> 36:31.021
I told ya he was my cousin.
He never rode with us once.

36:31.105 --> 36:33.481
18 year old, I gotta take him
back to his family, dead.

36:34.317 --> 36:35.901
You broke the law.

36:59.884 --> 37:01.384
People say they got one of the Youngers.

37:02.637 --> 37:04.804
People say they got the wrong Younger.

37:21.447 --> 37:23.615
All right, everybody ready?
Wait for 'em to come out.

37:38.547 --> 37:39.547
God...

37:51.310 --> 37:54.187
- What in the hell happened?
- I don't know.

37:54.272 --> 37:56.314
We put a smoke in the cabin.

37:56.399 --> 37:58.441
All of a sudden it blew.

37:58.526 --> 38:01.695
The only thing we meant to do
was drive 'em out to us.

38:03.030 --> 38:06.658
- Now you are sure it was not a bomb?
- Oh, no, it wasn't no bomb.

38:08.494 --> 38:12.622
The old lady must have thrown it in
her fireplace and the kerosene went up.

38:12.707 --> 38:14.249
That's the only thing I can figure.

38:15.209 --> 38:18.420
Killing a simple-minded,
15-year-old boy.

38:18.504 --> 38:22.299
You men did an excellent job in making
heroes out of every one of those men.

39:50.679 --> 39:54.015
Archie Peyton Samuel
was an innocent boy.

39:54.100 --> 39:58.561
It's a sad day when murder is committed
in the name of justice.

39:59.772 --> 40:03.483
This act tries the forbearance
of good Christian men.

40:04.360 --> 40:07.278
We commend
this child's body to the ground.

40:07.363 --> 40:10.448
His soul belongs to the Lord.

41:08.966 --> 41:11.759
Beth... Ed.

41:13.429 --> 41:15.221
You didn't bring no gun.

41:16.891 --> 41:19.017
I ain't got no quarrel
with the Pinkertons.

41:20.644 --> 41:24.272
I'm sorry about what
happened to Archie, but, uh...

41:25.107 --> 41:28.610
..since you boys kicked me out,
you can just fight your own fights.

41:30.488 --> 41:32.363
Is that how you feel about it, Beth?

41:36.702 --> 41:40.330
- No, it ain't.
- Come on. I've had enough talkin' here.

41:40.414 --> 41:42.165
You go your own way.

41:44.251 --> 41:46.836
Now you hold it.
You gotta learn to mind me.

41:46.921 --> 41:48.421
Ed,...

41:49.798 --> 41:51.382
..start walkin'.

42:01.685 --> 42:03.478
Is that what you want, Beth?

42:09.818 --> 42:11.653
Then to hell with you.

42:16.450 --> 42:18.451
To hell with both of you.

42:40.224 --> 42:43.476
Awful sorry about
your little brother. Sorry.

42:52.653 --> 42:56.656
Just rest now. We're gonna take you
over to Schofield's house directly.

42:59.702 --> 43:00.743
I'm sorry, Ma.

43:02.121 --> 43:03.788
I'm so sorry.

43:06.542 --> 43:08.543
Are you gonna make 'em pay, Jesse?

44:02.514 --> 44:03.806
You got it wrong.

44:03.891 --> 44:06.476
- We didn't do nothin'.
- Yes, you did.

44:07.061 --> 44:10.146
Some of our friends saw you
on the north road that night.

44:11.231 --> 44:15.985
Please, mister, it wasn't really a bomb.
It was supposed to smoke everybody out.

44:21.325 --> 44:23.910
My little brother was 15 years old.

44:25.037 --> 44:26.412
Now you think about that...

44:27.748 --> 44:29.374
..on your way to hell.

44:45.099 --> 44:48.267
The funeral will be in Chicago
and the governor will be there.

44:48.352 --> 44:51.938
Well, I'm sure it'll cheer their souls
just to hear you say that.

44:52.022 --> 44:54.982
It'd cheer them to know how many men
we have out combin' those hills.

44:56.443 --> 44:58.903
Those boys got
a lot of friends out there.

45:32.938 --> 45:34.564
What are these two doin' here?

45:35.315 --> 45:38.651
Visitin'. You got a law against that?

45:38.736 --> 45:41.404
No, ma'am. I got a law against murder.

45:41.488 --> 45:43.239
I got a warrant right here.

45:43.323 --> 45:46.075
I don't suppose it'd do me
any good to ask polite.

45:46.160 --> 45:49.036
It won't do you any good to ask at all.

45:49.830 --> 45:53.458
These men of yours are gonna end up
dead. Or they're gonna end up worse.

45:54.877 --> 45:57.211
You ladies are gonna be left
all alone just to think about it.

45:59.173 --> 46:00.506
Mr. Rowe!

46:01.800 --> 46:04.218
I want people in the house
and in the wood!

46:04.303 --> 46:06.721
All right, men, off your horses.
Let's go.

46:17.941 --> 46:19.859
(cock crows)

46:28.702 --> 46:30.328
Sooey! Sooey!

46:42.549 --> 46:43.883
Mornin', boys.

46:45.552 --> 46:47.220
Mornin', Cole.

46:51.642 --> 46:54.143
You boys waste the best part of the day.

46:54.770 --> 46:58.064
Hard to say y'all farm-bred
the way you sleep in.

46:58.816 --> 47:00.691
What's for breakfast?

47:00.776 --> 47:03.069
Grits. Cracklin' grits.

47:03.153 --> 47:05.029
Had 'em yesterday.

47:07.199 --> 47:10.535
- I'm sick of this damn hidin' out.
- Who ain't?

47:11.078 --> 47:14.747
Better mind your manners, Bob.
And thank McCorkindale here.

47:14.832 --> 47:16.666
Don't be pickin' on Bob, Jesse.

47:16.750 --> 47:20.336
- Hey, shut up, Jim.
- Shut up yourself, Frank.

47:20.420 --> 47:22.964
I ain't got nothin' but respect
for Mr. McCorkindale.

47:25.425 --> 47:28.261
You boys just got holed-up fever,
I know it.

47:28.345 --> 47:30.638
All y'all need is some fresh air.

47:31.765 --> 47:34.517
I'll get y'all some milk
as soon as I feed the chickens.

47:41.441 --> 47:43.150
(braying)

47:43.235 --> 47:44.777
(gunshot)

48:14.892 --> 48:16.934
- What about McCorkindale?
- Dead.

48:17.019 --> 48:19.312
- You sure?
- He's dead.

48:19.396 --> 48:20.813
Piss on ya.

48:26.653 --> 48:28.029
Cover him, dammit!

48:53.221 --> 48:55.723
Next volley, we go.
Frank's hurt. He goes first.

50:33.739 --> 50:37.575
# Where there's no more
stormy clouds arising

50:38.118 --> 50:43.998
# He whom I fix my hopes upon

50:44.082 --> 50:50.046
# Where there's no more
stormy clouds arising

50:50.130 --> 50:53.841
# His track I'll see

50:53.925 --> 50:56.260
# And I'll pursue

50:56.344 --> 50:58.012
# Where there's no more...

50:58.096 --> 51:02.767
What is your full name, Mrs. Samuel?
My paper would like to get it right.

51:04.144 --> 51:06.520
Zerelda Cole Samuel.

51:07.731 --> 51:10.900
My husband, Robert James,
died in California.

51:11.985 --> 51:15.237
My second husband
was called Reuben Samuel.

51:15.322 --> 51:18.908
And where did you and Mr. Samuel live?

51:19.993 --> 51:21.827
Clay County, Missouri.

51:21.912 --> 51:24.080
Are you the mother of Jesse James?

51:25.165 --> 51:27.249
I am.

51:27.334 --> 51:32.421
# Track I'll see and I'll pursue

51:32.506 --> 51:36.509
# Where there's no more stormy clouds...

51:36.593 --> 51:40.346
Mrs. Samuel,
you've already lost one son.

51:41.389 --> 51:45.184
Aren't you afraid the other two will
end up the same as McCorkindale?

52:01.910 --> 52:04.745
Ed, you identify the James boys or
the Youngers, there might be a reward.

52:08.750 --> 52:11.585
- How much?
- A couple of thousand dollars.

52:14.422 --> 52:15.881
Shit.

52:18.009 --> 52:20.136
Well, I got a question for you.

52:21.346 --> 52:23.639
How do I identify what you can't catch?

52:23.723 --> 52:26.642
They'll be caught. Jesse and his boys
are done with you anyway.

52:26.726 --> 52:29.895
Let me tell you one damn thing.

52:31.231 --> 52:34.608
I turn 'em in and I'm gonna get killed
by one of their relatives, sure as hell.

52:34.693 --> 52:38.112
I got six months to go
for bustin' up a place drunk,...

52:38.196 --> 52:40.573
..so I'm just gonna
take my chances, all right?

52:42.450 --> 52:46.704
Besides, Jesse might change his mind
and he pays better wages than you do,...

52:46.788 --> 52:48.789
..Pinkerton man.

52:53.420 --> 52:56.380
Frank, I never
saw myself as a farm girl.

52:56.464 --> 52:59.675
You ain't gonna be farmin', Annie.
You're gonna raise horses.

52:59.759 --> 53:02.678
I don't know anythin'
about raisin' horses, either.

53:02.762 --> 53:04.930
You know, it's funny.
Outside of bein' a banker,...

53:05.015 --> 53:08.225
..all I wanted to do
was to raise horses.

53:08.310 --> 53:11.270
Well, thanks to the Pinkertons,
you're gettin' your chance.

53:13.106 --> 53:16.525
We're not the only ones goin'
our own way. Everybody's doin' it.

53:16.610 --> 53:20.654
Jim Younger's off in the hills.
God only knows where Jesse is.

53:20.739 --> 53:22.781
Bob and Cole are headin' for Texas.

53:22.866 --> 53:25.034
The only reason
Cole went to Texas

53:25.118 --> 53:28.037
was he heard Belle Shirley
got married there.

53:28.121 --> 53:32.583
It's a long way to go lookin' for
trouble. We'll be just fine, Annie.

53:33.126 --> 53:34.460
Come on, mule!

53:38.465 --> 53:40.299
(# country music)

54:32.978 --> 54:34.436
You're late.

54:34.521 --> 54:37.398
I'm not much for bein' on time.

54:39.025 --> 54:40.901
You don't look real happy.

54:40.986 --> 54:43.737
Well, I'll tell ya somethin'
about Texas.

54:43.822 --> 54:45.322
It's loud.

54:45.407 --> 54:48.409
Well, I never figured you
for the homesick type.

54:48.493 --> 54:52.830
I ain't the homesick type.
I ain't the waitin' around type, either.

54:52.914 --> 54:55.457
I ain't the reliable type.

54:55.542 --> 54:58.127
Well, you oughta try gettin' married.

54:58.211 --> 55:01.130
Might improve your character.

55:01.214 --> 55:04.133
What do you do with that...
husband of yours?

55:04.217 --> 55:06.802
Leave him home, tied to the bed?

55:06.886 --> 55:09.054
Don't you make no fun of him.

55:10.765 --> 55:13.475
The way I got it figured,
you're gonna wear that Indian out.

55:13.560 --> 55:17.021
That double thump
and side swoop of yours.

55:17.105 --> 55:20.733
I do what I want with who I want
and don't make no mistake about it.

55:20.817 --> 55:23.193
Everybody says that
and they always have.

55:26.197 --> 55:29.158
Now you wanna see somethin',
you watch this.

55:29.242 --> 55:30.617
Come here!

55:37.250 --> 55:40.544
- You done?
- Not by a damn sight.

55:45.467 --> 55:46.842
(music stops)

55:55.769 --> 55:57.061
Now are you done?

55:58.104 --> 55:59.438
(gunshot)

56:04.944 --> 56:06.111
Sam.

56:07.906 --> 56:09.531
You Cole Younger?

56:09.616 --> 56:11.241
Who's askin'?

56:12.202 --> 56:15.788
Sam Starr. I'm married to that lady.

56:17.457 --> 56:18.582
Pleased to meet ya.

56:20.710 --> 56:24.713
Well now, boys, there is no need
to fight over little old me.

56:24.798 --> 56:28.258
But if you've got to,
you make it man-to-man.

56:30.970 --> 56:32.846
Hand-to-hand.

56:36.851 --> 56:38.143
Why not?

56:48.488 --> 56:49.613
Well,...

56:51.616 --> 56:53.617
..I'm glad I caught ya in a good mood.

57:06.214 --> 57:09.633
Here you go, both of you. Have a chew.

57:11.177 --> 57:15.389
- What does the winner get?
- Nothin' you both ain't already had.

57:18.393 --> 57:20.811
It don't make much sense, does it?

57:22.522 --> 57:25.149
No. You're both crazy.

57:26.443 --> 57:28.694
But you keep me occupied.

57:30.113 --> 57:32.781
I am having a real good time.

57:36.911 --> 57:38.745
Ten bucks on the half-breed!

58:57.116 --> 58:58.659
Come on, redskin!

59:22.183 --> 59:24.017
Come on, Missouri.

01:00:20.950 --> 01:00:22.743
What's the matter?

01:00:27.749 --> 01:00:29.416
You got what you wanted.

01:00:48.227 --> 01:00:50.228
(# music strikes up)

01:00:58.404 --> 01:01:02.157
- Sir, we met a few months back.
- I remember.

01:01:02.241 --> 01:01:04.534
I'd like to ask you a couple
of questions for my newspaper,

01:01:04.619 --> 01:01:05.994
if you don't mind.

01:01:06.913 --> 01:01:10.123
Like why you're havin' so much trouble
bringin' in the James-Younger gang.

01:01:12.085 --> 01:01:16.129
A lot of reasons. I came here with
four men that didn't know the territory.

01:01:16.214 --> 01:01:17.714
They were murdered.

01:01:17.799 --> 01:01:21.510
Most of the people here are related
to each other, so they're clannish.

01:01:21.594 --> 01:01:23.387
What about the local police?

01:01:23.471 --> 01:01:27.265
Local police get tired and quit
after chasin' the gang a coupla miles.

01:01:28.351 --> 01:01:32.354
Also, newspapers like your own print
lies, sayin' they're Robin Hoods.

01:01:32.438 --> 01:01:34.481
That doesn't help a great deal, either.

01:01:34.565 --> 01:01:37.693
My readers may ask why
you're sittin' next to a warm fire...

01:01:37.777 --> 01:01:39.361
..when you should be out on the chase.

01:01:40.571 --> 01:01:43.323
Right now the bunch
are spread out across five states.

01:01:43.408 --> 01:01:45.117
But they will be back.

01:02:34.709 --> 01:02:37.085
Zee, did you have
any visitors while I was gone?

01:02:37.170 --> 01:02:40.255
You mean was anyone

01:02:40.339 --> 01:02:43.300
tryin' to straighten up your sheets
and fluff your pillow?

01:02:43.384 --> 01:02:47.429
- I'm just askin'.
- Mind your manners, Mr. Jesse James.

01:02:47.513 --> 01:02:49.431
Just 'cause you're off fightin'
railroads and banks,

01:02:49.515 --> 01:02:51.933
don't mean you get a free tongue.

01:02:54.479 --> 01:02:58.523
I sent out word to the rest.
We're gonna be meetin' up real soon.

01:02:59.609 --> 01:03:01.318
We're goin' on a mission.

01:03:03.863 --> 01:03:06.031
I'm gonna get myself some cash...

01:03:08.326 --> 01:03:11.411
..and start lookin' around Missouri
for some girl to marry.

01:03:13.915 --> 01:03:15.207
Any prospects?

01:03:17.502 --> 01:03:18.710
I'm lookin'.

01:03:31.974 --> 01:03:33.517
I don't know, Annie.

01:03:34.519 --> 01:03:37.312
Maybe we're just goin'
in different directions.

01:03:38.564 --> 01:03:42.567
Maybe so. Can't help
wantin' what we want, can we?

01:03:43.736 --> 01:03:45.028
Yeah.

01:03:46.405 --> 01:03:51.701
Well, my going's got
nothin' to do with big dreams.

01:03:51.786 --> 01:03:54.746
Nobody ever made you go
anywhere you didn't wanna go, Frank.

01:04:00.294 --> 01:04:01.586
Good night.

01:04:20.982 --> 01:04:23.608
- How are you doin', Jim?
- I'm doin' OK.

01:04:32.952 --> 01:04:35.078
So, gents, let's get down to it.

01:04:35.162 --> 01:04:37.330
What's our next job gonna be?

01:04:40.001 --> 01:04:45.714
Minnesota. Them squareheads,
they got 'em a real fat bank up there.

01:04:46.716 --> 01:04:50.677
I scouted it out myself. Northfield.

01:04:52.847 --> 01:04:57.142
A lot of banks and cathouses
in Missouri we ain't done.

01:04:59.604 --> 01:05:02.564
Cole's right. Minnesota...

01:05:03.566 --> 01:05:05.191
It's a fair piece off our mark.

01:05:05.985 --> 01:05:10.447
Well, Clell says that bank's full to the
brim with money. That sounds good to me.

01:05:10.531 --> 01:05:11.656
(door opens)

01:05:14.660 --> 01:05:18.914
I want Bill Chadwell and Charley Pitts
to go with us. They're goddamn good men.

01:05:20.374 --> 01:05:22.751
- Who says?
- I do.

01:06:18.224 --> 01:06:20.058
I used to do this all the time.

01:06:21.727 --> 01:06:23.144
But, uh...

01:06:25.564 --> 01:06:28.066
I got married a few years back.

01:06:29.235 --> 01:06:33.989
I guess it slowed me down a bit,
if you know what I mean.

01:06:59.807 --> 01:07:01.266
Mornin', Jess.

01:07:06.939 --> 01:07:09.190
Hope you boys
had a good time last night.

01:07:09.275 --> 01:07:11.443
How was yours?

01:07:12.445 --> 01:07:14.612
I got better things to think about.

01:07:18.617 --> 01:07:20.118
Family man.

01:07:22.371 --> 01:07:25.790
My family's somethin'
you don't talk about, Cole Younger.

01:08:07.166 --> 01:08:10.085
# Well, I walked the street
with a tap to my feet

01:08:10.169 --> 01:08:12.754
# Heard a voice above me

01:08:12.838 --> 01:08:15.090
# A maid looked out
from a window up above

01:08:15.174 --> 01:08:17.716
# Said need somebody to love me

01:08:17.801 --> 01:08:20.095
# My father he's a minister

01:08:20.179 --> 01:08:22.596
# And virgins he doth cherish

01:08:22.680 --> 01:08:25.100
# Now she got five boys
and seven little girls

01:08:25.184 --> 01:08:27.977
# And a baby on her shoulder

01:08:37.279 --> 01:08:42.450
Well, Frank, when this is all over,
I think I'll write me a book.

01:08:42.535 --> 01:08:45.578
Make myself
even more famous than I am.

01:08:47.413 --> 01:08:49.707
If a pig had wings, it would fly.

01:08:50.792 --> 01:08:54.087
Nah. A book about my exploits...

01:08:55.381 --> 01:08:57.215
..as a gentleman and a lover.

01:08:59.718 --> 01:09:02.386
- I expect a free copy.
- Free copy?

01:09:05.975 --> 01:09:09.853
You gotta pay, Frank. Gotta pay.

01:09:12.398 --> 01:09:15.024
Have you ever been up north before?

01:09:15.109 --> 01:09:17.193
Got to Fetterman once.

01:09:17.278 --> 01:09:20.822
- Went to shoot buffalo.
- How'd you do?

01:09:20.906 --> 01:09:24.783
The price of hides went to hell
and I got the clap off some squaw.

01:10:18.088 --> 01:10:20.381
The bank's plumb in the center
of town,...

01:10:20.466 --> 01:10:23.718
..right between the dry goods store
and the mortuary.

01:10:23.802 --> 01:10:28.264
You reckon we oughta send in
a coupla scouts, check it all out?

01:10:28.349 --> 01:10:31.351
We rob banks, Jim.
We don't need any checkin'.

01:10:31.435 --> 01:10:34.437
You're talkin' soft,
somethin' I'd expect from Cole or Frank.

01:10:35.856 --> 01:10:38.858
I gave up tryin' to talk
sense to you a long time ago.

01:10:48.577 --> 01:10:50.578
Come on, let's take the damn bank.

01:10:50.663 --> 01:10:53.498
There ain't nothin' over there
but squareheads.

01:12:43.484 --> 01:12:45.443
(steam engine whistle)

01:14:03.021 --> 01:14:04.981
All right, good people, nobody move.

01:14:06.358 --> 01:14:08.734
Let's just show God
the palms of our hands.

01:14:08.819 --> 01:14:11.028
Now you don't give us
no trouble, mister.

01:14:11.530 --> 01:14:12.822
Clell, get to the vault.

01:14:19.872 --> 01:14:23.624
- Är den här hästen till salu?
- He's not for sale.

01:14:23.709 --> 01:14:25.084
Move on, squarehead.

01:14:32.092 --> 01:14:35.470
OK, now you open this safe
or I'll blow your head right off.

01:14:35.554 --> 01:14:37.597
I can't. It's a time lock.

01:14:40.267 --> 01:14:43.436
- What are you talkin' about?
- Time lock, hell!

01:14:43.520 --> 01:14:45.521
You open that safe, mister, you hear?

01:14:46.815 --> 01:14:49.525
The Pinkertons told us
you might be comin'.

01:14:49.610 --> 01:14:52.695
The lock is set just for you.
It only works at 4:30.

01:14:54.031 --> 01:14:55.656
The whole town is ready.

01:15:07.461 --> 01:15:10.213
No, mister, please don't shoot.
I have a family.

01:15:11.340 --> 01:15:14.133
Now, you got five seconds
to open up that vault, mister.

01:15:17.054 --> 01:15:18.721
Hur mycket ska ni ha för den?

01:15:18.805 --> 01:15:21.224
What the hell...? Get outta here!

01:15:22.809 --> 01:15:26.229
Det var synd. Det var eu vacker häst.

01:15:28.440 --> 01:15:31.484
- (woman screams)
- Be quiet, lady!

01:15:35.447 --> 01:15:36.447
(woman screams)

01:15:37.074 --> 01:15:39.367
- They're robbin' the bank!
- Jesus, Clell!

01:15:39.451 --> 01:15:42.620
They're robbin' the bank!

01:16:06.979 --> 01:16:09.272
- Let's get the hell outta here.
- Come on, Clell.

01:16:26.999 --> 01:16:28.165
Yankee bastard!

01:16:35.173 --> 01:16:36.507
Jim!

01:16:37.759 --> 01:16:38.926
Bob!

01:20:11.598 --> 01:20:14.725
Cole! Jesse!

01:22:28.735 --> 01:22:30.319
We gotta move, Frank.

01:22:31.988 --> 01:22:34.365
They'll get the rest of 'em to a doctor.

01:22:36.701 --> 01:22:40.287
- Who will?
- The posse that's gonna be chasin' us.

01:22:41.289 --> 01:22:44.333
We can't do that.
We can’t just leave 'em here alone.

01:22:59.599 --> 01:23:02.059
Jim, Cole,...

01:23:05.230 --> 01:23:06.647
..we gotta ride.

01:23:10.568 --> 01:23:11.819
What about the rest of 'em?

01:23:11.903 --> 01:23:14.530
This just ain't no time
to argue, Cole.

01:23:17.325 --> 01:23:20.160
Either you stay here an' die
or you come with us.

01:23:21.913 --> 01:23:23.414
Frank an' I are goin'.

01:23:51.609 --> 01:23:54.737
Kill me! Kill me, goddamn it!

01:23:55.822 --> 01:23:56.989
Frank.

01:24:02.370 --> 01:24:03.912
You're not leavin', are ya?

01:24:08.752 --> 01:24:10.669
I gotta stick with my brother, Cole.

01:24:32.317 --> 01:24:34.151
The Youngers don't need you.

01:25:16.903 --> 01:25:19.029
I like it better this way, Jesse.

01:25:20.865 --> 01:25:22.574
I get to see you run.

01:26:05.743 --> 01:26:08.245
Jim... Oh, Cole!

01:26:08.329 --> 01:26:12.291
Yeah, we're here, Bobby boy.
We're all here.

01:26:14.294 --> 01:26:16.670
Goddamn squareheads.

01:26:38.818 --> 01:26:40.903
Where the hell's Missouri?

01:28:08.825 --> 01:28:10.284
Come on, Frank.

01:28:11.661 --> 01:28:14.871
We're gonna get us a new gang together.
It's gonna be better than ever.

01:28:15.373 --> 01:28:17.833
Now you're not gonna quit on me now.

01:28:20.837 --> 01:28:22.963
All we gotta do is get across the river.

01:28:23.047 --> 01:28:25.340
All we gotta do is get home.

01:28:28.636 --> 01:28:30.220
We never shoulda left.

01:29:15.099 --> 01:29:17.601
You could say we was drove to it.

01:29:18.770 --> 01:29:22.272
Oh? How's that?

01:29:22.732 --> 01:29:26.568
If it weren't for the war,
we might have been somethin' else.

01:29:28.654 --> 01:29:31.531
You're a little too young
to have fought in the war.

01:29:31.616 --> 01:29:35.369
But my brothers weren't,
and we all go one direction together.

01:29:35.453 --> 01:29:38.372
You tell me who they are
and it might mean a lighter sentence.

01:29:38.456 --> 01:29:39.873
Think about that.

01:29:39.957 --> 01:29:42.667
You and I both know it was
the James boys, don't we, Cole?

01:29:42.752 --> 01:29:45.462
Sure do feel poorly.

01:29:47.298 --> 01:29:50.217
Ain't a surprise. Eleven bullets
must be some kinda record.

01:29:51.386 --> 01:29:53.720
What do you think about a life sentence?

01:29:53.805 --> 01:29:56.014
You're lucky they don't allow
hangin' in this state.

01:29:57.683 --> 01:30:00.227
Come on, Cole.
Tell me what you think about all this.

01:30:06.150 --> 01:30:08.318
Oh, hell, we played a rough game.

01:30:08.403 --> 01:30:10.028
We lost.

01:30:12.073 --> 01:30:14.116
I spent four years in the army.

01:30:14.200 --> 01:30:16.952
Eleven tryin' to get out of it.

01:30:17.662 --> 01:30:20.372
What about the James boys?

01:30:22.375 --> 01:30:25.001
- I don't know nothin' about 'em.
- Sure you do.

01:30:27.130 --> 01:30:29.840
As far as I'm concerned,
they never been in this state.

01:30:43.604 --> 01:30:45.355
Are you another reporter?

01:30:46.232 --> 01:30:49.776
No. My name's Jacob Rixley.
I'm with the Pinkerton agency.

01:30:49.861 --> 01:30:52.404
I been chasin' you boys
for a long time, Bob.

01:30:53.406 --> 01:30:55.240
Yes, sir, I guess you have.

01:30:55.992 --> 01:30:58.118
I wanna talk to you
about the James boys.

01:30:58.202 --> 01:31:00.454
You don't owe them a thing, you know.

01:31:00.538 --> 01:31:03.957
If it was them, they wouldn't
protect you to get them one day less.

01:31:04.041 --> 01:31:06.835
But unless you help me,

01:31:07.462 --> 01:31:10.046
you and your brothers
are gonna be in this jail for life.

01:31:12.175 --> 01:31:13.800
(Jim) Uh-uh.

01:31:16.220 --> 01:31:17.679
What's he tryin' to say?

01:31:19.474 --> 01:31:22.559
He said to tell you we done it
for Dixie and nothin' else.

01:31:25.104 --> 01:31:27.314
15,000 for Jesse.

01:31:27.398 --> 01:31:29.733
Another 10,000 will get you Frank.

01:31:32.153 --> 01:31:34.905
The Pinkerton company and
the governor can't afford that.

01:31:34.989 --> 01:31:39.743
You know who you're talkin' to?
You know who sprung out of Missouri?

01:31:39.827 --> 01:31:42.746
Jameses, Youngers, Clantons, Earps.

01:31:43.247 --> 01:31:45.373
And now Bob and Charlie Ford.

01:31:45.458 --> 01:31:48.168
Word's out that you and Jesse
aren't friends, anyway.

01:31:48.252 --> 01:31:52.172
Is that so? Well,
that very same Mr. Jesse James...

01:31:52.256 --> 01:31:55.217
..that you can't find at all
just asked us to come and visit him.

01:31:57.970 --> 01:31:59.638
Let's go, Bob.

01:32:01.098 --> 01:32:02.265
Wait a minute.

01:32:03.434 --> 01:32:05.227
$15,000.

01:32:06.103 --> 01:32:08.104
Half before and half when it's done.

01:32:09.232 --> 01:32:10.774
Got yourself a deal.

01:32:17.031 --> 01:32:18.490
No more for me.

01:32:21.869 --> 01:32:24.579
Heard you were thinkin'
about a bank in Kansas, Jesse.

01:32:25.706 --> 01:32:27.958
You don't talk business
at the table, Bob.

01:32:29.669 --> 01:32:30.794
Sorry.

01:32:36.217 --> 01:32:37.676
Say, how'd you boys like a drink?

01:32:37.760 --> 01:32:39.636
Sounds good.

01:32:40.805 --> 01:32:43.390
- Don't it, Bob?
- Sure thing.

01:32:44.809 --> 01:32:47.060
Could I have your plate, please, Jesse?

01:32:51.566 --> 01:32:52.941
Charlie.

01:33:03.953 --> 01:33:07.497
- Are you feelin' all right?
- She ain't real fond of the company.

01:33:10.876 --> 01:33:12.627
Don't worry none, ladies.

01:33:12.712 --> 01:33:15.297
Just talkin' some things over,
that's all.

01:33:25.182 --> 01:33:26.558
Can you say good night?

01:33:26.642 --> 01:33:28.435
Good night.

01:33:36.611 --> 01:33:40.071
He might be carryin' a hide-out.
I bet he is.

01:33:41.365 --> 01:33:44.909
He knows. I know he knows.

01:33:50.541 --> 01:33:52.208
Pour me one, Bob.

01:33:56.797 --> 01:33:58.548
You look spooked, Charlie.

01:34:00.134 --> 01:34:01.593
Like hell.

01:34:02.511 --> 01:34:04.721
Nothin' spooks me, Jesse.
You know that.

01:34:09.518 --> 01:34:12.270
Now I've been thinkin'
about the Platte City bank.

01:34:12.355 --> 01:34:14.731
It's gonna be a big one.

01:34:14.815 --> 01:34:16.274
We ain't too sure.

01:34:17.276 --> 01:34:20.111
- Why not?
- I don't know.

01:34:20.196 --> 01:34:22.906
You're a hard man
to do business with, Jesse.

01:34:26.869 --> 01:34:28.620
It's crooked.

01:34:29.330 --> 01:34:30.330
What'd you say?

01:34:31.916 --> 01:34:33.541
I said, it's not straight.

01:34:39.590 --> 01:34:41.633
I really like this old sampler.

01:34:42.301 --> 01:34:44.636
Ma gave this to me for my weddin' day.

01:34:48.766 --> 01:34:50.100
Is that straight?

01:34:51.519 --> 01:34:53.395
I shot Jesse James.

01:35:00.486 --> 01:35:03.154
- Mr. Rixley?
- That's right.

01:35:04.448 --> 01:35:06.116
My name is Frank James.

01:35:09.120 --> 01:35:11.121
I came here to turn myself in.

01:35:13.499 --> 01:35:14.999
Here's my gun.

01:35:16.627 --> 01:35:18.336
I want something in return.

01:35:20.506 --> 01:35:22.632
I want to be able to bury my brother.

01:35:24.844 --> 01:35:26.803
Suppose I don't agree to your terms.

01:35:29.181 --> 01:35:30.348
I'll kill you.

01:37:35.683 --> 01:37:37.934
# Jesse James we understand

01:37:38.018 --> 01:37:40.270
# Has killed a many man

01:37:40.354 --> 01:37:44.732
# He robbed the Union trains

01:37:44.817 --> 01:37:47.610
# But history does record

01:37:47.695 --> 01:37:49.696
# That Bob and Charlie Ford

01:37:49.780 --> 01:37:54.284
# Have laid Jesse James in his grave

01:37:54.368 --> 01:37:56.619
# It was on a Saturday night

01:37:56.704 --> 01:37:58.955
# The stars were shinin' bright

01:37:59.039 --> 01:38:03.042
# When they robbed that Union train

01:38:03.127 --> 01:38:05.879
# And it was one of the Younger boys

01:38:05.963 --> 01:38:08.298
# That gathered in the spoils

01:38:08.382 --> 01:38:12.135
# And carried that money away

01:38:36.619 --> 01:38:39.037
# In his small home unaware

01:38:39.121 --> 01:38:41.414
# A-straightenin' pictures there

01:38:41.498 --> 01:38:45.418
# He thought he heard a noise

01:38:45.502 --> 01:38:48.171
# And as he turned his head

01:38:48.255 --> 01:38:50.381
# Well, a bullet killed him dead

01:38:50.466 --> 01:38:54.177
# Fired by Bob Ford, one of the boys

01:38:55.429 --> 01:38:59.724
# For Jesse had a wife,
she lived a lady all her life

01:38:59.808 --> 01:39:03.686
# The children they were brave

01:39:04.855 --> 01:39:06.814
# But history does record

01:39:06.899 --> 01:39:09.192
# That Bob and Charlie Ford

01:39:09.276 --> 01:39:12.195
# Have laid poor Jesse

01:39:12.279 --> 01:39:15.198
# Laid poor Jesse

01:39:15.282 --> 01:39:18.326
# Have laid Jesse James

01:39:18.410 --> 01:39:22.664
# In his grave

01:39:23.305 --> 01:39:29.232
