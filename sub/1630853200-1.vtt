WEBVTT

00:39.323 --> 00:41.167
Hey, just think, Abby,
you're never gonna have to come

00:41.191 --> 00:43.293
back to this town again.

01:03.213 --> 01:06.484
- Abby, this is crazy.
- Yeah.

01:06.751 --> 01:09.687
I think you should
disinfect it first.

01:12.155 --> 01:13.525
Hey, where
the fuck is the beer?!

01:13.558 --> 01:14.592
I know you brought it.

01:14.626 --> 01:17.227
Come on, just
tell me where it is!

01:20.097 --> 01:22.065
It is really going to hurt.

01:22.099 --> 01:24.368
Stop freaking her out!

01:24.569 --> 01:26.604
Are you fuckin' ready?

01:26.638 --> 01:29.039
Yeah.

01:30.842 --> 01:33.210
One...

01:33.243 --> 01:35.780
two...

01:37.114 --> 01:38.550
Ah, ow!

01:38.583 --> 01:40.451
Oh!

01:41.519 --> 01:42.620
Oh...

01:42.654 --> 01:44.489
Oh, wow.

01:44.522 --> 01:47.124
Oh my God, does it hurt?

01:47.391 --> 01:48.560
Mm, yeah.

01:52.396 --> 01:54.231
Hell yes.

01:54.264 --> 01:55.509
You need
something more permanent.

01:55.533 --> 01:58.636
This is, like, not...

01:58.670 --> 02:00.237
Cops!

02:00.270 --> 02:01.773
Run!

immediately.

03:00.732 --> 03:02.299
My father is going to kill me!

03:02.332 --> 03:03.635
Like I always say...

03:03.668 --> 03:04.845
if you don't take
chances in this life,

03:04.869 --> 03:07.639
you're already dead.

03:07.672 --> 03:09.774
Where did you meet her?

03:09.807 --> 03:11.241
At the park last week.

03:11.274 --> 03:12.309
She's from LA.

03:12.342 --> 03:13.811
Pretty cool, huh?

03:14.277 --> 03:16.380
Hey!

03:16.413 --> 03:18.616
Get off my land!

03:18.883 --> 03:19.684
You're on my land.

03:19.717 --> 03:21.719
We gotta run, we gotta run!

03:21.753 --> 03:24.321
Tell that to the Indians.

03:25.222 --> 03:26.024
Oh, really?

03:26.057 --> 03:27.400
Well, go ahead and
kill your youth,

03:27.424 --> 03:28.526
I don't care!

03:28.559 --> 03:31.395
Right here, I'm a big bullseye!

03:31.428 --> 03:32.096
What?

03:32.130 --> 03:33.272
I don't care, he can shoot me.

03:33.296 --> 03:34.065

Hi, we're not here right now,

04:14.639 --> 04:16.974
but we'll call you back if
you leave your name and number.

04:17.008 --> 04:19.409
Thanks, bye!

04:23.346 --> 04:25.550
Deb?

04:27.018 --> 04:28.953
Deb!

04:30.822 --> 04:33.423
I know you're there.

04:36.426 --> 04:38.496
Deb?

04:39.630 --> 04:41.599
How many times do I have to...

04:41.632 --> 04:43.634
Ugh!

05:12.063 --> 05:14.031
We have Amber
Dominguez from the Gold Coast

05:14.065 --> 05:17.367
4-H Club here to share a little
about what she's learning.

05:17.400 --> 05:19.704
We prepared for
her arrival by building the pen

05:19.737 --> 05:20.705
and...

05:20.738 --> 05:22.940
Why do you even
watch the local news?

05:23.941 --> 05:26.911
Aren't you gonna be late?

05:26.944 --> 05:28.646
You should quit smoking.

05:28.679 --> 05:30.948
It gives you cancer.

05:33.751 --> 05:35.586
So what do you
like most about your experience

05:35.620 --> 05:37.320
raising a lamb for the fair?

05:37.354 --> 05:39.991
I like the
experience of managing money and

05:40.024 --> 05:41.793
budgeting and...

05:41.826 --> 05:44.729
I'm gonna need your help
for my Hometown History paper.

05:46.497 --> 05:48.398
Okay.

05:48.431 --> 05:50.868
Later today.

05:50.902 --> 05:53.805
Is Kat sleeping
over this weekend?

05:53.838 --> 05:58.009
Yeah, but you're probably gonna
have to lie to her dad again.

05:58.042 --> 06:00.812
Oh, you know I hate doing that.

06:00.845 --> 06:03.815
Yeah, but they'd freak if they
knew you were working nights.

06:03.848 --> 06:05.082
Why?

06:05.116 --> 06:06.617
You guys are smart.

06:06.651 --> 06:08.920
I trust you.

06:12.590 --> 06:15.726
Notice anything
different about me?

06:18.663 --> 06:21.098
Yeah, they're huge, Abby.

06:21.132 --> 06:23.100
No!

06:23.134 --> 06:25.870
I pierced my nose.

06:28.673 --> 06:30.875
Mm.

06:32.743 --> 06:35.378
So?

06:35.412 --> 06:39.851
Is Dad gonna be coming
by to pick up his stuff?

06:39.884 --> 06:42.453
Just asking so I'm not here.

06:42.486 --> 06:44.922
You know, you're gonna have
to see him sooner or later.

06:44.956 --> 06:46.057
Why?

06:46.090 --> 06:48.559
You don't.

06:50.027 --> 06:52.630
That's different.

06:54.165 --> 06:56.667
But Mom...

06:56.701 --> 06:58.736
Abby!

06:58.769 --> 07:02.372
Please let me sleep?

07:05.442 --> 07:07.845
I'm gonna go, then.

07:08.779 --> 07:10.815
Love you.

07:10.848 --> 07:12.984
Love you.

07:26.130 --> 07:27.698
Hey, hooker!

07:36.540 --> 07:37.440
Hey.

07:37.475 --> 07:38.910
Oh my God, wait, wait, wait.

07:38.943 --> 07:39.744
You pierced your nose?

07:39.777 --> 07:41.579
How does it look?

07:41.612 --> 07:42.647
It looks like shit.

07:42.680 --> 07:45.182
It looks like shit.

07:45.216 --> 07:46.183
You going to work already?

07:46.217 --> 07:48.653
Ugh, it's inventory, kill me.

07:48.686 --> 07:49.987
Oh, hey, come by work today?

07:50.021 --> 07:51.522
- Please?
- Maybe.

07:51.555 --> 07:52.523
Maybe?

07:52.556 --> 07:53.591
You're lame.

07:53.624 --> 07:55.960
- All right, hold on.
- Okay.

08:05.970 --> 08:08.172
- Okay, see ya.
- See ya.

08:17.715 --> 08:18.749
Did you mom look at it?

08:18.783 --> 08:20.017
Stop it.

08:20.051 --> 08:21.485
Why didn't you
just go get it done?

08:21.519 --> 08:22.453
DIY, Kat!

08:22.486 --> 08:25.790
I can't afford to have
people do things for me.

08:27.992 --> 08:31.629
So, my dad's trying to force
me to join an Ag-Ed internship.

08:31.662 --> 08:32.873
So why don't you just tell
him you don't wanna do it?

08:32.897 --> 08:36.133
Right, 'cause that's
always worked well with him.

08:37.535 --> 08:38.970
Hey, virgins.

08:39.003 --> 08:40.104
Oh, hey, it's you.

08:40.137 --> 08:42.039
- Hey.
- Hey, guys.

08:42.073 --> 08:45.209
I thought I smelled cow shit.

08:46.277 --> 08:47.521
I was supposed to
register today,

08:47.545 --> 08:49.113
but this place blows.

08:49.146 --> 08:50.848
- I call ditch day.
- I'm in.

08:50.881 --> 08:51.983
- Abby!
- What?

08:52.016 --> 08:53.184
Let's all go.

08:53.217 --> 08:55.653
You know I can't go, and Mr.
Sosa's gonna ask where you are.

08:55.686 --> 08:58.789
Don't you have to be
registered to ditch?

08:58.823 --> 09:00.124
I... I can't ditch today.

09:00.157 --> 09:01.392
Yeah, me either.

09:01.425 --> 09:03.203
My father's threatening to send
me to school in Japan if I don't

09:03.227 --> 09:04.267
make honor roll this year.

09:04.295 --> 09:05.196
Your dad's from Japan?

09:05.229 --> 09:06.664
Kick-ass!

09:06.697 --> 09:08.065
No, he went to high school here.

09:08.099 --> 09:09.934
He's never even been to Japan.

09:09.967 --> 09:10.868
Oh...

09:10.901 --> 09:12.269
Do you need help to register?

09:12.303 --> 09:13.671
Aww, so cute.

09:13.704 --> 09:14.705
Okay, let's go.

09:14.739 --> 09:16.073
I'm gonna have a party...

09:16.107 --> 09:17.808
and we've gotta
spread the word...

09:17.842 --> 09:20.111
except the shit-kicker.

09:21.579 --> 09:23.080
Well, I'm going to class.

09:32.857 --> 09:33.824
Will you bitches hurry up?

09:33.858 --> 09:34.898
You're gonna get me fired.

09:34.925 --> 09:36.027
Oh, relax.

09:36.060 --> 09:37.762
This party will
change your life.

09:37.795 --> 09:39.697
Mm, I'm sorry, I don't
hang out with teenagers.

09:39.730 --> 09:40.831
You're still a teenager.

09:40.865 --> 09:42.033
Mm...

09:42.066 --> 09:43.834
Oh, customers.

09:43.868 --> 09:45.770
So, where are
your parents gonna be?

09:45.803 --> 09:48.973
Bakersfield,
campin' out for the races.

09:49.006 --> 09:52.309
Yeah, Karen and Stepdude...
take that... are always gone.

09:52.343 --> 09:53.778
Pops is pissed about it.

09:53.811 --> 09:56.313
I'll probably move back
to LA, live with him.

09:56.347 --> 09:57.848
You just got here.

09:57.882 --> 09:59.192
You can come
visit me this summer.

09:59.216 --> 10:02.153
And warning: You won't
want to come back here.

10:04.288 --> 10:05.322
20 dollars.

10:05.356 --> 10:07.291
Mm-hm.

10:07.625 --> 10:10.161
Best party of your life.

10:13.697 --> 10:15.199
Really?

10:15.232 --> 10:16.200
No.

10:16.233 --> 10:17.268
Uninvited.

10:17.301 --> 10:20.137
Don't... don't mind her.

10:20.171 --> 10:20.771
Enjoy.

10:20.805 --> 10:23.607
Jesus, this town needs us.

10:23.641 --> 10:24.509
Yeah, that's for you.

10:24.543 --> 10:27.044
Are there any other
cool people here?

10:30.181 --> 10:33.717
Okay, I can't get
inside your brain.

10:34.985 --> 10:37.288
Greatest album of all time.

10:37.321 --> 10:39.957
It changed everything about me.

10:39.990 --> 10:41.025
Yeah.

10:41.058 --> 10:42.827
Well, does he know this?

10:42.860 --> 10:43.394
I don't know.

10:43.427 --> 10:44.595
Well, does he know this?

10:44.628 --> 10:48.599
I think he deserves to know
that this is your favorite.

12:31.035 --> 12:33.437
No, I asked you first.

12:34.905 --> 12:38.075
Betty took a shit on
our way to a gig in SLO.

12:38.108 --> 12:40.945
It'll take a few
days to fix so...

12:40.978 --> 12:42.346
here we are.

12:42.379 --> 12:44.782

12:45.316 --> 12:47.017

12:47.051 --> 12:48.486

12:48.520 --> 12:50.020
I don't have a phone.

12:50.054 --> 12:51.422
Why?

12:51.456 --> 12:52.899
I tossed it out the
window on the way up here.

12:52.923 --> 12:55.025
It's a long story.

12:55.059 --> 12:57.828
- Classic.
- Party?

12:57.861 --> 12:59.497
Hm.

12:59.531 --> 13:00.831
At 7:30?

13:00.864 --> 13:02.299
I'm so in.

13:02.333 --> 13:03.501

13:43.841 --> 13:45.209
I would reconsider that.

13:45.242 --> 13:46.110
I don't need it, I...

13:46.143 --> 13:48.812

13:50.981 --> 13:52.883
That's not what the matter is.

13:52.916 --> 13:54.894
I think we should wait until
the test results come back.

13:54.918 --> 13:56.887
Can you just get
this out of my arm?!

13:56.920 --> 13:59.223
Hey, I need you to
cooperate a little, okay?

13:59.256 --> 14:02.192
Just a little.

14:03.927 --> 14:08.032
I just need to get outta
here and go home and...

14:08.065 --> 14:09.933
I know.

14:10.401 --> 14:13.304
But, well, we need to work on
lowering your blood pressure

14:13.337 --> 14:16.807
down a little bit, okay?

14:17.007 --> 14:19.310
Can you at least open the
blinds so maybe I can see the

14:19.343 --> 14:21.278
sun?

14:26.884 --> 14:29.554

You know I hate albondigas.

16:03.380 --> 16:04.692
Papacito, I
didn't made it for you,

16:04.716 --> 16:06.618
I made it for Abby
because she loves them.

16:06.651 --> 16:09.420
She's here everyday.

16:09.454 --> 16:10.688
Oy, just in time.

16:10.722 --> 16:12.356
Go to the table.

16:12.389 --> 16:13.424
Andale, mami.

16:15.660 --> 16:18.362
And help me take
in the chilitos.

16:18.395 --> 16:20.632
Where are the tortillas?

16:20.665 --> 16:22.634
Can somebody help me
bring in the tortillas?

16:22.667 --> 16:24.502
Yeah, I got it.

16:24.536 --> 16:27.070
Gracias, Abby.

16:27.605 --> 16:30.073
Thank you, mamita.

16:30.340 --> 16:31.442
Abby...

16:31.476 --> 16:33.711
is that an earring
on your nose, loca?

16:33.745 --> 16:35.379
Yes, sir.

16:35.412 --> 16:36.313
Guess what.

16:36.346 --> 16:38.449
ROP is placing me in
the bank next week.

16:38.483 --> 16:40.384
I'll be working
right next to Mom.

16:40.417 --> 16:42.119
Okay, well done,
mija, that's good.

16:42.152 --> 16:43.655
Good, I'm glad to hear that.

16:45.222 --> 16:46.256
Gracias.

16:46.290 --> 16:47.400
I'm gonna love
you forever, woman.

16:47.424 --> 16:49.627
Me too.

16:50.227 --> 16:54.398
Katita, did you ask about
summer internship today?

16:54.431 --> 16:55.533
No.

16:55.567 --> 16:56.734
You gotta hurry.

16:56.768 --> 16:59.203
Everyone in Ag-Ed
applies for those spots.

16:59.236 --> 17:00.971
I will!

17:01.438 --> 17:02.574
Dad, uh...

17:02.607 --> 17:05.543
I need Nana's help for my
Hometown History project paper.

17:05.577 --> 17:08.045
Yeah, we'll go
over there tomorrow.

17:08.580 --> 17:11.415
Abby, are you sure your mom
doesn't mind having Katita

17:11.448 --> 17:14.051
staying over again?

17:14.719 --> 17:15.620
Of course.

17:15.653 --> 17:18.222
She loves having Kat over.

17:18.255 --> 17:22.125
So Abby, what is your
Hometown History paper about?

17:27.331 --> 17:29.166
I know you girls
better do something.

17:29.199 --> 17:31.503
You guys better start
thinking about jobs.

17:31.536 --> 17:35.473
If I hadn't joined Ag-Ed,
I'd be a picker like abuelo.

17:37.074 --> 17:38.318
You know, they don't give
out those foreman jobs just to

17:38.342 --> 17:40.377
anybody.

17:40.410 --> 17:43.548
How are you gonna get a
job looking like that?

17:51.823 --> 17:53.458
Lesbian!

17:53.491 --> 17:55.527
No!

17:55.560 --> 17:57.595
What do you think?

17:57.629 --> 18:00.532
You know, no boy is ever
gonna want you now, right?

18:02.634 --> 18:04.736
Like I care.

18:04.769 --> 18:06.136
You care.

18:06.169 --> 18:07.271
No, she doesn't.

18:07.304 --> 18:11.576
Hey, is that your dad's
crap in those boxes outside?

18:12.376 --> 18:14.679
So she just put all your
dad's stuff out there and didn't

18:14.712 --> 18:15.880
even tell him?

18:15.914 --> 18:18.783

I can feel myself aging.

18:32.329 --> 18:34.566
Did you know
Cassie had her baby?

18:34.599 --> 18:36.433
I just saw her today.

18:36.467 --> 18:38.302
I heard.

18:38.335 --> 18:40.370
Maybe we should go visit.

18:40.404 --> 18:42.507
Why?

18:42.540 --> 18:44.374
She's an idiot.

18:44.408 --> 18:47.144
Her life is over.

18:50.280 --> 18:52.316
I'd never do that.

18:52.349 --> 18:54.384
Not with that hair.

18:54.418 --> 18:55.520
Ow.

18:55.553 --> 18:59.089
I can't even imagine what
I'd do if I got pregnant.

18:59.557 --> 19:02.259
Probably just get married
or something, I guess.

19:02.292 --> 19:07.331
Right, and get stuck in this
stupid town with some stupid guy

19:07.364 --> 19:10.668
and just work forever,
for the rest of your life.

19:10.702 --> 19:12.670
Ooh, depressing, much?

19:12.704 --> 19:14.539
Ugh!

19:14.572 --> 19:16.774
There she is, there she is!

19:17.642 --> 19:19.711
Hurry, go!

19:20.645 --> 19:22.513
Hey.

19:22.714 --> 19:24.348
Your hair...

19:24.381 --> 19:27.184
I love it, it's so cool!

19:29.587 --> 19:30.688
Whoa.

19:30.722 --> 19:32.490
This nut...

19:45.737 --> 19:47.505
Whoo!

20:02.887 --> 20:06.289
What's your story, huh?

20:06.557 --> 20:08.826
You're married?

20:09.961 --> 20:12.730
You don't wear a ring...

20:12.764 --> 20:16.634
but you sure wear
the burden of a man.

20:17.635 --> 20:21.405
Oh, come on, I've been poked and
prodded here for two days now.

20:21.438 --> 20:22.406
I'm the one dying.

20:22.439 --> 20:24.207
You've gotta give me something.

20:24.241 --> 20:26.309
You're not dying.

20:27.845 --> 20:30.615
I'm getting divorced.

20:30.648 --> 20:33.450
- Is it that obvious?
- Well...

20:34.585 --> 20:36.353
Can you get my bag
out of the closet?

20:36.386 --> 20:38.656
It's in the bottom there.

20:40.323 --> 20:42.392
Yep.

20:43.728 --> 20:45.930
Thank you.

20:47.665 --> 20:48.566
Here.

20:48.599 --> 20:50.802
Here, here.

20:51.469 --> 20:52.537
What is this?

20:52.570 --> 20:55.773
Well, there's a little
market right around the corner.

20:55.807 --> 20:58.776
You gonna hop out and
get us something sweet?

20:58.810 --> 21:01.646
Oh, you're funny...

21:01.679 --> 21:03.648
You know I can't do that.

21:03.681 --> 21:06.617
You should learn to lighten up.

21:07.350 --> 21:09.921
And not always
play by the rules.

21:09.954 --> 21:12.590
I never would've gotten anywhere
in business if I didn't break

21:12.623 --> 21:15.358
the rules from time to time.

21:16.627 --> 21:20.430
That's right, businesswoman.

21:20.765 --> 21:24.301
We got those nurseries
out on Black Road...

21:24.769 --> 21:28.005
and all those
farms west of Simas.

21:28.039 --> 21:29.674
Yeah!

21:29.707 --> 21:31.843
Okay.

21:32.710 --> 21:34.979
You said "we."

21:36.581 --> 21:39.249
- Are you married?
- Yeah.

21:40.317 --> 21:41.552
Where is he?

21:41.586 --> 21:43.554
Jose?

21:43.588 --> 21:47.390
He's dead, thank God.

21:47.992 --> 21:49.894
How about you and
this non-husband?

21:49.927 --> 21:51.496
You got kids?

21:51.529 --> 21:53.330
Yeah.

21:53.598 --> 21:54.766
Abby.

21:54.799 --> 21:56.701
She's 16.

21:56.734 --> 21:58.435
Same age that I had her.

21:58.469 --> 22:00.303
- Ah.
- Can't believe it.

22:01.939 --> 22:05.943
Yeah, I had my
daughter when I was 17.

22:07.545 --> 22:10.047
You wanna kick that apple
farm from the tree, right?

22:13.684 --> 22:18.321
Uh, yeah, yes, yes, you do.

22:18.355 --> 22:20.057
Um, I'm lucky.

22:20.091 --> 22:21.058
Hm?

22:21.092 --> 22:23.393
Abby, she's nothing like me.

22:23.426 --> 22:26.731
Mm-hm, yeah, right.

22:38.643 --> 22:42.412
Good evening, ladies
and not-so-gentlemen!

24:54.745 --> 24:57.815
A weird, creepy mohawk
boy is following me.

24:57.848 --> 25:00.151
A boy is following you?

25:00.184 --> 25:02.586
Yeah.

25:02.853 --> 25:05.022
Yes.

25:05.056 --> 25:06.891
There you are.

25:06.924 --> 25:09.493
Whoa.

25:09.527 --> 25:12.463
I like it.

25:13.064 --> 25:14.699
You guys were...

25:14.732 --> 25:16.701
um, great tonight.

25:16.734 --> 25:19.704
Oh, no, we, uh...

25:19.737 --> 25:22.673
we're still trying
to find our sound.

25:23.007 --> 25:28.012
We're aiming for a cross
between Bowie and Bad Brains,

25:28.813 --> 25:31.849
but I don't know.

25:31.882 --> 25:34.118
So, like...

25:34.151 --> 25:37.722
Ziggy Stardust falls
down a flight of stairs?

25:37.755 --> 25:39.657
Wow.

25:39.690 --> 25:41.726
I'm impressed.

25:41.759 --> 25:44.195
That's exactly it.

25:44.228 --> 25:47.031
I just listen to old music.

25:49.300 --> 25:52.636
I think you guys
have your own sound.

25:52.970 --> 25:55.506
Thanks.

26:02.913 --> 26:05.716
I promise I don't bite.

26:12.323 --> 26:14.759
I'm not know for
my promises but...

26:18.596 --> 26:20.765
Have you thought
at all about, um...

26:20.798 --> 26:22.767
what we were talking about?

26:22.800 --> 26:25.169
Oh, singing?

26:25.202 --> 26:26.837
Singing, performing.

26:26.871 --> 26:27.705
Dave!

26:27.738 --> 26:28.773
There you are!

26:28.806 --> 26:30.107
Come on, let's go.

26:30.141 --> 26:31.709
Food.

26:31.742 --> 26:32.910
Come on, we gotta go outside.

26:32.943 --> 26:34.845
- There's food.
- All right, one minute.

26:34.879 --> 26:35.646
Let's go, though.

26:35.679 --> 26:37.548
Come on.

26:40.618 --> 26:43.654
Have you ever, um...

26:43.687 --> 26:45.856
loved something or...

26:45.890 --> 26:49.794
somebody so much
that you can't breathe,

26:49.827 --> 26:51.662
you can't...

26:51.695 --> 26:53.130
live without them?

26:53.164 --> 26:54.598
I want another beer.

26:54.632 --> 26:55.733
What's in here?

26:55.766 --> 26:56.934
- Tig.
- Yeah?

26:56.967 --> 26:59.270
Can I have a minute?

26:59.303 --> 27:00.271
Can we have a minute?

27:00.304 --> 27:02.640
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

27:05.309 --> 27:07.278
Seriously, there's, uh...

27:07.311 --> 27:10.581
there's nothing else like it.

27:12.049 --> 27:15.686
You know, it's, uh...
it's better than sex.

27:15.719 --> 27:17.354
Dave... come on.

27:17.388 --> 27:19.990
Let's go, come on, man.

27:20.391 --> 27:22.827
That's what it's like.

27:22.860 --> 27:24.895
Performing, it's... it's...

27:24.929 --> 27:25.963
like breathing.

27:25.996 --> 27:28.332
You should try it some time.

27:28.732 --> 27:31.635
And if I'm right, and you
like it as much as I think you

27:31.669 --> 27:34.205
will...

27:58.295 --> 27:59.096
Tig, stop.

27:59.130 --> 28:00.064
Listen, we're going to New York,

28:00.097 --> 28:03.134
we're going to Boston,
we're going to Chicago...

28:03.167 --> 28:05.269
- Mm.
- And Milwaukee?

28:05.302 --> 28:05.970
Minnesota.

28:06.003 --> 28:07.238
Don't forget about Minnesota.

28:07.271 --> 28:08.483
Are you gonna pick us up
for the Grunion Run tomorrow?

28:08.507 --> 28:10.908
Oh, no, you're gonna have to
find another sucker to take you

28:10.941 --> 28:13.811
because I am not missing Harry
Styles on SNL tomorrow night.

28:13.844 --> 28:15.346
Is that tomorrow?

28:15.379 --> 28:16.280
Yeah.

28:16.313 --> 28:17.748
I can't believe you like him.

28:17.781 --> 28:19.216
Do not just me
for being a Styler.

28:19.250 --> 28:20.151
I'll cut you.

28:20.184 --> 28:21.886
You know, guys, I
don't know about you,

28:21.919 --> 28:25.356
but I am sick of these
fascist scumbag politicians.

28:25.389 --> 28:27.758
- Oh, God.
- Seriously!

28:27.791 --> 28:29.693
They just want us to
sit down and shut up.

28:29.727 --> 28:31.095
They don't care about us.

28:31.128 --> 28:32.706
They don't care about you,
they don't care about you,

28:32.730 --> 28:34.841
they don't care about you,
and you guys are all asleep.

28:34.865 --> 28:36.834
- What about me?
- And you need to wake up.

28:36.867 --> 28:38.903
- Seriously!
- Sit down, drama queen!

28:38.936 --> 28:43.107
It's resistance to
oppression, not aggression.

28:43.140 --> 28:46.177
Okay, but... but honestly,
your band's, like, really good.

28:46.210 --> 28:47.354
I... I'm not just saying that.

28:47.378 --> 28:49.256
- I've seen a lot of bands.
- Don't fill his head up.

28:49.280 --> 28:50.181
- What?
- He doesn't need it.

28:50.214 --> 28:51.015
Listen to her.

28:51.048 --> 28:51.550
Seriously, don't
fill his head up.

28:51.583 --> 28:52.983
She's a smart girl.

28:53.017 --> 28:54.318
What can I get you guys?

28:54.351 --> 28:55.920
I'll order for everybody.

28:55.953 --> 28:58.456
I think we'll have 15
coffees, 15 French fries,

28:58.490 --> 29:00.724
and 15 sides of ranch, please.

29:00.758 --> 29:03.060
- We have menudo.
- Abby.

29:03.093 --> 29:04.195
- Perfect.
- Abby.

29:04.228 --> 29:06.130
- What?
- I have to go.

29:06.163 --> 29:07.998
- Right now?
- Yeah.

29:08.032 --> 29:11.235
Yeah, I'm actually
kinda wanting to go too.

29:14.238 --> 29:16.474
Oh, thank you.

29:16.508 --> 29:18.809
That's cow guts, by the way.

29:18.842 --> 29:20.044
What?

29:20.077 --> 29:21.755
It's actually made from the
muscle wall of the first three

29:21.779 --> 29:24.014
chambers of the cow's stomach.

29:24.915 --> 29:27.184
Where are we?

29:33.857 --> 29:35.426
Abby.

29:35.460 --> 29:36.760
Abby!

29:36.794 --> 29:38.862
I have to go.

29:39.531 --> 29:41.432
All right, everybody
go potty, all right?

29:41.466 --> 29:42.833
The bus is leaving.

29:45.202 --> 29:47.371
Come on, let's go!

29:47.404 --> 29:49.373
- Hey.
- Well, did you like it?

29:49.406 --> 29:50.841
- What?
- We are leaving.

29:50.874 --> 29:51.375
Why?

29:51.408 --> 29:52.109
Where are you going?

29:52.142 --> 29:53.877
Home.

29:54.211 --> 29:55.079
Lame.

29:55.112 --> 29:57.114
What is up with
these goody-two-shoes?

29:57.147 --> 29:59.917
They're cool, you
just don't know them yet.

29:59.950 --> 30:01.453
- Okay.
- Anyway, 'Kay, bye.

30:01.486 --> 30:03.087
Bye.

30:06.423 --> 30:07.858
No, no, no, no!

30:07.891 --> 30:10.894
It's meticulum.

30:11.362 --> 30:13.397
So you like him.

30:13.430 --> 30:14.331
Like who?

30:14.365 --> 30:15.266
No one.

30:15.299 --> 30:16.468
A boy?

30:16.501 --> 30:17.469
Ooh.

30:17.502 --> 30:18.802
Mm.

30:18.836 --> 30:21.205
Is Kat cooking for herself?

30:21.238 --> 30:23.073
No, she's
cooking for both of us.

30:23.107 --> 30:25.442
Ooh.

30:33.317 --> 30:35.553
Ah.

30:49.133 --> 30:53.170
Um, I'm actually
not that hungry.

30:53.203 --> 30:57.141
I have to go work on my
project with my dad so...

30:58.142 --> 31:00.578
I'll text you later.

31:00.612 --> 31:03.247
Bye, Deb.

31:07.885 --> 31:10.555
Do you want this?

31:11.088 --> 31:12.856
I'm gonna go to bed.

31:16.628 --> 31:19.464
And call your dad, tell him
to come pick up his shit.

31:19.497 --> 31:20.331
What?!

31:20.364 --> 31:21.265
No, you call him!

31:21.298 --> 31:24.502
Abby, just talk to him for me.

33:13.210 --> 33:14.712
- Turn it down!
- No!

33:14.746 --> 33:16.380
No?!

33:16.413 --> 33:17.981
No!

33:18.015 --> 33:21.018
Hey, turn it down!

33:21.486 --> 33:24.489
This is oppression!

33:25.289 --> 33:27.958
And I'm never
talking to you again!

33:34.431 --> 33:35.609
Do you guys think
Dave will be there?

33:35.633 --> 33:37.334
He's supposed to be, why?

33:37.367 --> 33:38.302
I'm just wondering.

33:38.335 --> 33:40.337
Apparently, he gave
this girl Erica crabs.

33:40.370 --> 33:41.549
They didn't even do it,
they just sat in the hot tub

33:41.573 --> 33:42.474
together.

33:42.507 --> 33:44.074
You cannot get crabs like that!

33:44.107 --> 33:46.210
- Oh my God!
- Oh my God!

33:46.243 --> 33:48.011
Shit.

33:52.182 --> 33:54.284
We need to take
her to the hospital.

33:54.318 --> 33:55.687
Well, how does it look?

33:55.720 --> 33:58.222
Uh, hardcore.

33:58.255 --> 33:58.890
Let's go drink.

33:58.923 --> 34:01.926
Come on.

34:05.797 --> 34:07.632
Hello!

34:07.665 --> 34:09.032
- Hey, girls.
- Yeah?

34:09.066 --> 34:10.033
You guys want some beers?

34:10.067 --> 34:12.236
- Heck yeah, man.
- All right.

34:12.269 --> 34:14.438
Whoa, what the
hell happened to you?

34:14.472 --> 34:15.773
I got punched.

34:15.807 --> 34:17.441
Yeah, right.

34:17.475 --> 34:18.776
Yeah.

34:18.810 --> 34:21.345
You should see the other guy.

34:25.349 --> 34:27.060
You know, I think you
should get me one first.

34:27.084 --> 34:28.729
You know, I got blood
all over my flannel...

34:28.753 --> 34:30.254
No, how about she waits?

34:30.287 --> 34:32.724
Waiting is not one
of my strong suits.

34:32.757 --> 34:33.758
Thanks.

34:33.791 --> 34:35.192
- You want one?
- Yes, definitely.

34:35.225 --> 34:36.794
This fire is dying.

34:36.828 --> 34:38.195
What use are you guys?

34:38.228 --> 34:39.597
I mean, honestly.

34:39.631 --> 34:40.671
For one, I gave you a beer.

34:40.698 --> 34:43.433
I know, but
you're being very slow about it.

34:44.434 --> 34:45.679
There's a trick to this:
You gotta get it in the right

34:45.703 --> 34:46.538
spot...

34:46.571 --> 34:49.239
- Hey.
- Hey.

34:51.241 --> 34:52.810
I would like one.

34:52.844 --> 34:54.144
- I know you would.
- Okay.

34:54.177 --> 34:56.514
- That's why I'm opening one.
- Okay.

34:58.650 --> 35:00.552
Oh, do you want a drink?

35:00.585 --> 35:04.589
Oh, no, I don't... I don't
really like to drink that much.

35:08.526 --> 35:11.261
Do you wanna walk?

35:11.729 --> 35:13.565
You and me?

35:13.598 --> 35:15.500
Yeah.

35:15.533 --> 35:18.603
What, you don't trust me?

35:22.740 --> 35:25.075
Come on.

35:29.413 --> 35:31.783
Where are they going?

35:31.816 --> 35:35.385
My dad used to bring me
to these as a kid all the time.

35:35.419 --> 35:36.788
You need a flashlight.

35:36.821 --> 35:39.524
Your dad used to bring
you to wash fish do it?

35:39.557 --> 35:41.593
That's...

35:41.626 --> 35:44.495
That was some
father-daughter time?

35:45.362 --> 35:47.130
Huh?

35:47.164 --> 35:49.634
My dad used to take me to bars.

35:50.167 --> 35:52.202
Not in the bar, obviously.

35:52.235 --> 35:54.806
He'd make me wait in the car.

35:54.839 --> 35:59.242
You know,
father-son bonding shit.

35:59.443 --> 36:00.612
Hm.

36:00.645 --> 36:02.346
Well...

36:02.379 --> 36:05.483
does he like your band?

36:05.516 --> 36:07.284
Oh, he died a
couple of years ago.

36:07.317 --> 36:08.686
Oh God, I'm sorry.

36:08.720 --> 36:11.188
No, that's okay.

36:12.523 --> 36:15.425
Yeah, I remember...

36:15.460 --> 36:17.705
at his funeral, everybody was
talking about what a great guy

36:17.729 --> 36:20.397
- he was.
- Yeah?

36:20.932 --> 36:24.602
He was a drunk asshole.

36:25.937 --> 36:28.706
My mom kinda...

36:28.740 --> 36:31.776
checked out after
that, so I split.

36:31.809 --> 36:34.311
I haven't been back since.

36:34.344 --> 36:36.714
So you left home?

36:36.748 --> 36:38.448
Yep.

36:38.483 --> 36:40.785
How old were you?

36:40.818 --> 36:43.488
16.

36:44.421 --> 36:46.557
Really?

36:47.625 --> 36:50.728
My dad's gone, too.

36:50.762 --> 36:52.597
When did he die?

36:52.630 --> 36:54.666
He didn't.

36:54.699 --> 36:57.535
My dad got a woman
at work pregnant.

36:57.568 --> 36:59.470
Shit.

36:59.504 --> 37:01.673
Yeah.

37:01.706 --> 37:03.608
I guess he loves her.

37:03.641 --> 37:06.711
At least that's
what he told my mom.

37:06.911 --> 37:10.313
Honestly, I'm never
talking to him again.

37:12.382 --> 37:14.284
I told him I...

37:14.317 --> 37:17.320
wished he was dead.

37:21.324 --> 37:24.595
Never told anyone
that part, though.

37:26.597 --> 37:28.866
Come on.

37:29.734 --> 37:31.669
Come on.

37:34.337 --> 37:35.707
Come on.

37:38.009 --> 37:40.444
Hey, uh...

37:40.478 --> 37:42.914
I heard about this open
mic night thing and I,

37:42.947 --> 37:45.783
uh... I got an idea.

37:45.817 --> 37:47.885
For you?

37:48.886 --> 37:51.321
Well, you know, we could really
use someone like you on the

37:51.354 --> 37:53.891
stage with us.

37:54.759 --> 37:57.427
Seriously.

38:01.699 --> 38:04.401
If we got in a boat...

38:04.434 --> 38:06.003
and we just...

38:06.037 --> 38:10.508
went out until we hit land,
where do you think we'd end up?

38:11.042 --> 38:12.543
China?

38:12.577 --> 38:14.879
China.

38:14.912 --> 38:17.447
How cool is that?

38:17.915 --> 38:20.417
I'm going.

38:20.450 --> 38:22.820
To China?

38:22.854 --> 38:25.322
Everywhere.

38:26.657 --> 38:29.594
Where do you wanna go?

38:29.861 --> 38:31.361
I don't know, nowhere.

38:31.394 --> 38:32.764
Oh, come on.

38:32.797 --> 38:35.466
You must wanna go somewhere.

38:35.933 --> 38:38.268
London?

38:38.536 --> 38:40.303
Abby on Abbey Road?

38:42.807 --> 38:44.441
Come on, let's go.

38:44.475 --> 38:46.043
We'll ditch the Van, we'll fly.

38:46.077 --> 38:47.845
We'll fly out to
London, Manchester,

38:47.879 --> 38:49.514
and then...

38:49.547 --> 38:50.715
we'll go to China.

38:50.748 --> 38:52.884
"We?"

38:53.684 --> 38:55.920
Yeah.

38:55.953 --> 38:58.923
It might look a little
more like Bakersfield,

38:58.956 --> 39:02.059
Hemet, and the
middle of America but...

39:06.497 --> 39:10.067
That's how you change the world:

39:10.101 --> 39:13.638
One shitty little
town at a time.

39:14.572 --> 39:17.642
Music can do that.

39:21.712 --> 39:24.715
We should probably go back.

39:26.784 --> 39:29.020
Let me go first.

39:29.053 --> 39:31.722
Careful.

39:33.390 --> 39:34.892
Come here.

39:34.926 --> 39:35.459
Come here.

39:35.493 --> 39:36.961
Oh, my shoe got soaked!

39:36.994 --> 39:37.962
My shoe got wet.

39:37.995 --> 39:39.964
Here, come sit here.

39:39.997 --> 39:41.499
Come sit.

39:41.532 --> 39:44.635
You can't have wet shoes.

39:44.669 --> 39:47.404
You'll get a cold.

39:52.810 --> 39:54.645
Yeah.

39:54.679 --> 39:56.914
You'll freeze to death.

39:56.948 --> 39:57.982
Better?

39:58.015 --> 40:00.551
Yeah, better.

40:09.961 --> 40:14.732
He doesn't talk about it
much, but for a long time...

40:14.765 --> 40:18.636
my grandfather worked
the strawberry fields.

40:23.440 --> 40:26.644
It's okay,
Kathleen, take your time.

40:30.181 --> 40:34.085
My grandfather worked
the strawberry fields,

40:34.118 --> 40:38.890
even slept out there at night,
all to save money to bring my

40:38.923 --> 40:43.127
abuela and my mom to the US.

40:43.461 --> 40:46.697
Now, we try to pay back his
sacrifices by working hard and

40:46.731 --> 40:51.736
doing our part to contribute
to our town and the community.

40:53.804 --> 40:58.175
"They do not know my name, but
they will know of my hard work,"

40:58.209 --> 41:01.512
and this, beautiful people,
is what the great Cesar Chavez

41:01.545 --> 41:03.514
fought so hard for.

41:03.547 --> 41:06.183
Farm workers are an integral
part of how our great country

41:06.217 --> 41:08.486
runs.

41:08.753 --> 41:12.189
Kathleen, beautiful and
fascinating family history.

41:12.223 --> 41:13.791
Thank you.

41:13.824 --> 41:17.662
And why do we tell our
stories and learn about history?

41:17.695 --> 41:20.598
Because those who
forget the past are condemned to

41:20.631 --> 41:22.600
- relive it.
- Yes.

41:22.633 --> 41:24.969
Hey!

41:26.637 --> 41:30.574
Everyone except Abby is excused.

41:38.849 --> 41:42.219
What a real treat to
have you in class today.

41:42.253 --> 41:43.955
Am I being punished?

41:43.988 --> 41:47.692
You know, I don't
believe in punishment.

41:47.725 --> 41:51.729
I just thought we would
have lunch together today.

41:53.531 --> 41:56.167
Did you bring any lunch?

41:56.200 --> 41:58.970
No one eats lunch at lunch.

41:59.003 --> 42:00.838
Really, now?

42:00.871 --> 42:02.940
Hm.

42:07.278 --> 42:09.947
I grow this myself, you know?

42:13.684 --> 42:15.553
Mm.

42:16.954 --> 42:19.023
Here you go.

42:25.896 --> 42:27.765
Mm.

42:30.568 --> 42:34.972
So, how's your
paper coming along?

42:42.046 --> 42:43.214
I see.

42:43.247 --> 42:48.586
Well, maybe you'll get inspired
on our Hometown field trip.

42:49.120 --> 42:51.555
What am I
supposed to write about?

42:51.589 --> 42:53.290
You can write
about your own story,

42:53.324 --> 42:56.560
your family's, or...

42:56.594 --> 42:58.829
what do you love

I remember when your
dad used to bring us here.

45:43.495 --> 45:45.138
He would always let us
drive that old truck.

45:45.162 --> 45:47.932
Well, we couldn't even
reach the pedals but...

45:47.965 --> 45:51.135
he always let us do
whatever we wanted.

45:51.168 --> 45:53.971
Yeah, whatever.

45:55.172 --> 45:56.883
Why haven't you ever told me
what happened between you and

Dave?

45:59.443 --> 46:02.213
Oh, I didn't?

46:02.246 --> 46:03.347
Did you kiss him?

46:03.380 --> 46:05.082
I mean, what about the crabs?

46:05.115 --> 46:08.452
Oh my God, he
doesn't have crabs!

46:13.057 --> 46:15.993
You know he's leaving, Abby.

46:17.127 --> 46:18.896
So?

46:18.929 --> 46:20.297
Come on, bitches, let's go!

I'm sorry.

49:29.253 --> 49:31.656
Abby!

49:34.526 --> 49:36.427
What... what are you doing?

49:36.461 --> 49:38.663
You're not even ready yet?

49:39.664 --> 49:41.365
So cool!

49:41.398 --> 49:43.511
Yep, Karen and Stepdude are
gone for the next two nights,

49:43.535 --> 49:45.570
so this baby is all mine.

49:45.603 --> 49:47.705

51:18.696 --> 51:19.731
Oh, no, I'm good.

51:19.764 --> 51:21.699
- Really?
- Yeah.

51:26.169 --> 51:29.406
No, no, no, no, no.

stage-dove, the sea parted,

51:44.789 --> 51:46.356
and just... bam.

51:46.390 --> 51:48.425
- And no one caught you.
- No, no one...

51:48.459 --> 51:50.294
God, she's such a liar.

51:50.327 --> 51:51.228
What?

51:51.261 --> 51:52.830
- Who?
- Kristi.

51:52.864 --> 51:54.431
She's such a liar.

51:54.465 --> 51:56.834
No, she's not.

51:56.868 --> 51:59.637
Can we please
not do this right now?

52:30.568 --> 52:31.536
I'm serious, come on.

52:31.569 --> 52:32.670
- Come on!
- No, no, no, no.

52:32.704 --> 52:34.338
- No?
- I can't, I can't, I can't.

52:34.371 --> 52:35.616
We'll play
whatever song you want!

52:35.640 --> 52:38.743

55:52.103 --> 55:53.604
I can take us home.

55:53.638 --> 55:54.939
Wow, you really do get around.

56:08.920 --> 56:10.688

56:37.748 --> 56:39.449

56:39.483 --> 56:40.651

57:30.801 --> 57:33.738
Why didn't you have more kids?

57:36.540 --> 57:41.045
I'm sorry, I'm not
pushin', just dying.

57:41.078 --> 57:43.748
You're not dying.

57:45.016 --> 57:47.952
I don't know.

57:48.152 --> 57:50.521
Everything just got so hard.

57:50.554 --> 57:52.590
Mm.

57:52.623 --> 57:54.926
I hear you.

57:54.959 --> 57:56.994
But you can say it.

57:57.028 --> 58:01.098
I mean, maybe you just
didn't even want more kids.

58:08.105 --> 58:10.975
He wanted more.

58:15.980 --> 58:19.449
And now, he's...

58:19.850 --> 58:22.086
he's going to.

58:22.119 --> 58:26.057
Ah, there it is.

58:26.257 --> 58:29.727
Now you're telling
yourself the truth.

58:31.929 --> 58:34.765
I need to get you back in.

58:34.799 --> 58:39.804
Divorce would be the best
thing that ever happened to you.

58:40.004 --> 58:42.840
I don't know about that.

58:42.873 --> 58:46.844
I don't buy bullshit
and neither should you.

58:46.877 --> 58:48.713
I'll deal how I want to deal.

58:48.746 --> 58:53.117
Why don't you live
how you want to live?

58:53.150 --> 58:55.720
You weep, you mope.

58:55.753 --> 58:58.556
You don't change anything.

58:59.290 --> 59:01.258
You don't know me.

59:01.292 --> 59:03.060
Sure.

59:03.094 --> 59:05.162
I know.

59:05.896 --> 59:08.532
I know, I'm awful.

59:08.566 --> 59:10.201
Take me back to my room.

59:22.179 --> 59:24.749
So how about the open mic night?

59:24.782 --> 59:25.950
I don't know!

59:25.983 --> 59:28.786
Come on, you're gonna be great!

59:29.186 --> 59:31.922
Why are you doing this?

59:35.126 --> 59:37.695
Doing what?

59:37.728 --> 59:39.964
That.

59:39.997 --> 59:42.166
Isn't it obvious?

59:42.199 --> 59:44.802
I like you!

59:45.002 --> 59:46.904
You're like a clam!

59:46.937 --> 59:47.972
What?!

59:48.005 --> 59:48.973
Like a clam, you know?

59:49.006 --> 59:50.841
With... with a Pearl!

59:50.875 --> 59:54.879
You open it up and there's
something beautiful inside.

1:00:09.894 --> 1:00:11.929
It's an oyster!

1:00:11.962 --> 1:00:12.930
What?!

1:00:12.963 --> 1:00:13.931
An oyster!

1:00:13.964 --> 1:00:16.967
An oyster has pearls!

1:00:17.301 --> 1:00:18.736
I'm an idiot!

1:00:28.379 --> 1:00:29.880
Come on.

1:00:31.048 --> 1:00:33.317
All right, lay back.

1:00:38.656 --> 1:00:40.991
Debora?

1:00:41.325 --> 1:00:43.294
Will you do something for me?

1:00:43.327 --> 1:00:45.262
Hm?

1:00:45.996 --> 1:00:48.299
Will you take
that plant with you?

1:00:48.332 --> 1:00:51.001
Take it home?

1:00:51.936 --> 1:00:53.370
I couldn't.

1:00:53.404 --> 1:00:56.907
My daughter, she doesn't even
call me and just has a plant

1:00:56.941 --> 1:00:58.242
sent to me from my own nursery?

1:00:58.275 --> 1:01:00.044
Really, I couldn't.

1:01:00.077 --> 1:01:02.847
I can't, uh,
really grow anything.

1:01:02.880 --> 1:01:04.782
You take it.

1:01:04.815 --> 1:01:07.084
Plant it.

1:01:07.284 --> 1:01:10.754
Just do me a favor:
Get it out of here.

1:01:15.893 --> 1:01:17.862
- This is your house, huh?
- Mm-hm.

1:01:17.895 --> 1:01:19.196
This your tree?

1:01:19.230 --> 1:01:22.766
- Yeah, I... I own it, actually.
- Oh, cool.

1:01:26.370 --> 1:01:28.973
Oh my God.

1:01:29.440 --> 1:01:32.843
I have to be up in two hours.

1:01:33.043 --> 1:01:35.146
How's stuff going with your dad?

1:01:35.179 --> 1:01:36.747
Kiss her again!

1:01:39.116 --> 1:01:41.252
It's not.

1:01:41.719 --> 1:01:43.354
He came over and I hid.

1:01:43.387 --> 1:01:45.823
You hid?

1:01:45.856 --> 1:01:47.892
He's an asshole.

1:01:47.925 --> 1:01:52.096
Look, I'm... I'm not gonna
tell you what you should do.

1:01:52.129 --> 1:01:54.265
Then don't.

1:01:55.866 --> 1:01:58.936
You're tough, all right?

1:02:00.204 --> 1:02:02.450
I sometimes think about all the
things I wish I said to my dad.

1:02:02.474 --> 1:02:05.676
Kiss the girl!-

1:02:07.344 --> 1:02:10.381
And sometimes, I
even say them out loud,

1:02:10.414 --> 1:02:13.083
like he can hear me.

1:02:15.219 --> 1:02:18.989
I know it's bad, but us guys,
we don't always use our brains.

1:02:19.023 --> 1:02:21.759
So I'm learning.

1:02:23.093 --> 1:02:25.829
How about your mom?

1:02:26.163 --> 1:02:29.133
She's gonna be home really soon.

1:02:29.166 --> 1:02:31.435
Okay.

1:02:36.173 --> 1:02:38.275
That's my sister!

1:02:38.309 --> 1:02:41.245
Yeah, get it!

1:02:42.046 --> 1:02:44.148
I should go.

1:02:44.181 --> 1:02:46.717
- Come on, Dave!
- Bye.

1:02:46.984 --> 1:02:48.419
Come back!

1:02:48.452 --> 1:02:49.497
You guys are
really blowing my cool.

1:02:49.521 --> 1:02:50.488
Wait!

1:02:50.522 --> 1:02:52.923
Will I see you?

1:02:53.991 --> 1:02:55.826
Come on tour with us.

1:02:55.859 --> 1:02:56.827
- Whoo!
- Yeah, come!

1:02:56.860 --> 1:02:58.996
I'm serious!

1:02:59.863 --> 1:03:02.266
Forever!

1:03:05.470 --> 1:03:06.837
Gather 'round.

1:03:06.870 --> 1:03:08.372
Have a seat.

1:03:08.405 --> 1:03:10.107
What are we doing at a church?

1:03:10.140 --> 1:03:13.978
I have asked your wonderful
classmate Laura Nakashima to

1:03:14.011 --> 1:03:15.513
read part of her paper here.

1:03:15.547 --> 1:03:17.815
- Laura?
- Fine.

1:03:18.148 --> 1:03:21.051
In 1945, this church
became the home of displaced

1:03:21.085 --> 1:03:23.521
Japanese-Americans after being
released from camps during the

1:03:23.555 --> 1:03:25.055
war.

1:03:25.089 --> 1:03:27.459
This church gave
them shelter and food.

1:03:27.492 --> 1:03:30.194
A number of families
were forced to live here,

1:03:30.227 --> 1:03:34.231
since everything they owned
was taken away from them.

1:03:34.499 --> 1:03:38.435
One of those families
was my grandfather's.

1:03:38.836 --> 1:03:41.205
Isn't that just fascinating?!

1:03:41.238 --> 1:03:43.274
You're way too
excited about this.

1:03:43.307 --> 1:03:47.945
And why do we tell our
stories and learn about history?

1:03:47.978 --> 1:03:51.215
Because those who
forget the past are condemned to

1:03:51.248 --> 1:03:52.283
relive it.

1:03:52.316 --> 1:03:53.350
Yes!

1:03:53.384 --> 1:03:56.488
I can't
remember what I did last night.

1:03:56.521 --> 1:03:59.223
Uh, could we, uh, walk around?

1:03:59.256 --> 1:04:00.824
Yes, please!

1:04:00.858 --> 1:04:02.426
Respectfully, people.

1:04:02.460 --> 1:04:05.162
You never told us that your
families were in the camp.

1:04:05.195 --> 1:04:06.306
Why should I have to tell you?

1:04:06.330 --> 1:04:07.831
Your parents grew up here too.

1:04:07.865 --> 1:04:10.167
Everybody's stupid
parents grew up in this town,

1:04:10.200 --> 1:04:12.002
whatever.

1:04:12.269 --> 1:04:14.506
So, I've been thinking
about the open mic tonight.

1:04:14.539 --> 1:04:16.307
Can't, I have taiko practice.

1:04:16.340 --> 1:04:18.175
That's the
Japanese drumming, right?

1:04:18.208 --> 1:04:19.109
But tonight?

1:04:19.143 --> 1:04:20.044
You guys have to come.

1:04:20.077 --> 1:04:21.211
Why don't you understand?

1:04:21.245 --> 1:04:24.114
I know my parents, my life,
is just some joke to you,

1:04:24.148 --> 1:04:27.519
but I have other things
that are expected of me, Abby.

1:04:27.552 --> 1:04:29.253
Yeah, but Dave asked me.

1:04:29.286 --> 1:04:31.489
You don't even care!

1:04:32.022 --> 1:04:34.158
I... I do.

1:04:38.429 --> 1:04:39.863
Furukawa?

1:04:39.897 --> 1:04:42.299
Your parents worked that farm?

1:04:44.168 --> 1:04:48.272
So, our families actually
worked the same farm, then.

1:04:48.305 --> 1:04:51.075
Yeah, cool.

1:04:51.108 --> 1:04:52.142
Still mad at you, though.

1:04:52.176 --> 1:04:53.611
Okay, everyone,
this way, please.

1:04:53.645 --> 1:04:54.479
This way.

1:04:54.512 --> 1:04:55.480
Come on!

1:04:55.513 --> 1:04:57.482
You're gonna love this story.

1:04:57.515 --> 1:05:01.885
The local mission sponsored a
rescue operation to save the

1:05:01.919 --> 1:05:03.954
southern Channel Islands'
remaining Native American

1:05:03.987 --> 1:05:09.026
population, although did we
know they wanted to be rescued?

1:05:09.059 --> 1:05:11.362
During the
rescue, a storm arose!

1:05:11.395 --> 1:05:13.364
And realizing the
imminent danger,

1:05:13.397 --> 1:05:17.368
the ship left, leaving one
person... a young Juana Maria...

1:05:17.401 --> 1:05:18.603
behind.

1:05:18.636 --> 1:05:21.573
It took 18 years and several
expeditions back to the island

1:05:21.606 --> 1:05:23.575
to try and find her.

1:05:23.608 --> 1:05:27.311
Eventually, they were successful
in bringing her to the mainland.

1:05:27.344 --> 1:05:31.915
The sad part is she died
from illness seven weeks later.

1:05:31.949 --> 1:05:34.051
But that's just one
version of the story!

1:05:34.084 --> 1:05:37.321
Oh man, I love this.

1:05:37.354 --> 1:05:41.593
Some say she actually
boarded the first ship...

1:05:41.626 --> 1:05:45.129
and, realizing her
child had been left behind,

1:05:45.162 --> 1:05:46.296
dove overboard!

1:05:46.330 --> 1:05:48.274
She swam back to the island
knowing she would be left

1:05:48.298 --> 1:05:49.601
behind!

1:05:49.634 --> 1:05:52.202
Amazing, isn't it?!

1:05:52.236 --> 1:05:57.241
A mother willing to give
up everything for her child.

1:05:58.710 --> 1:06:02.379
And who doesn't love romantic
stories, huh?

1:06:02.647 --> 1:06:05.349
Are you mad at
me about something?

1:06:05.382 --> 1:06:08.218
Oh my God, it's huge.

1:06:08.252 --> 1:06:09.453
Sure, laugh away.

1:06:09.487 --> 1:06:11.499
This is the last time you'll
be seeing me outside of class.

1:06:11.523 --> 1:06:12.757
Because of a hickey?

1:06:12.791 --> 1:06:15.359
No, because my parents found me
on the front doorway sleeping in

1:06:15.392 --> 1:06:16.960
a pile of vomit!

1:06:16.994 --> 1:06:18.304
I can't believe
you left me there.

1:06:18.328 --> 1:06:20.230
Well, how was I
supposed to know?!

1:06:20.264 --> 1:06:21.398
I just...

1:06:21.432 --> 1:06:23.376
You're the one who ran up
and rang your own doorbell!

1:06:23.400 --> 1:06:25.446
How was I supposed to know that
they wouldn't open the door?!

1:06:25.470 --> 1:06:26.638
I ran away!

1:06:26.671 --> 1:06:27.715
I just can't believe you let
that guy suck on your neck like

1:06:27.739 --> 1:06:29.707
- that.
- I feel sick.

1:06:29.741 --> 1:06:31.375
It's funny!

1:06:31.408 --> 1:06:34.144
You're such an ass!

1:06:43.688 --> 1:06:45.523
Yeah, strawberries!

1:06:45.557 --> 1:06:50.294
Like how do you know which
ones are ready to be picked?

1:06:53.631 --> 1:06:56.701
Did you like the
Lone Woman story?

1:06:59.637 --> 1:07:03.475
To think she lived alone for
years on that island peacefully,

1:07:03.508 --> 1:07:06.711
until she was rescued.

1:07:07.377 --> 1:07:11.549
She only died because she
stayed to save her stupid kid.

1:07:11.583 --> 1:07:13.685
And he died, anyways.

1:07:13.718 --> 1:07:17.054
You didn't tell that
part of the story.

1:07:17.387 --> 1:07:20.324
She could've saved herself.

1:07:21.526 --> 1:07:22.760
True.

1:07:22.794 --> 1:07:25.763
And who knows how long she would
have lived if man just left her

1:07:25.797 --> 1:07:27.164
alone.

1:07:29.266 --> 1:07:32.069
Men mess up everything.

1:07:32.804 --> 1:07:34.539
I see.

1:07:52.557 --> 1:07:54.258
Isn't it crazy?

1:07:54.291 --> 1:07:59.129
Farmers will have to feed
nine billion people in 2015.

1:07:59.162 --> 1:08:00.598
"Feed the nine."

1:08:00.632 --> 1:08:01.833
I heard about that.

1:08:01.866 --> 1:08:05.803
I mean, I know you guys, like,
worked on farms and helped raise

1:08:05.837 --> 1:08:08.071
animals and stuff.

1:08:08.105 --> 1:08:10.608
Well, yeah, I know
you think it's not cool.

1:08:10.642 --> 1:08:13.076
No, I just...

1:08:13.110 --> 1:08:15.713
I wanna know more.

1:08:16.313 --> 1:08:18.483
We also do a lot of
community service events,

1:08:18.516 --> 1:08:21.619
and it's just awesome to belong,
to have a support system and...

1:08:21.653 --> 1:08:24.321
What are you talking about?

1:08:24.522 --> 1:08:27.792
Do you have to wear
that jacket everywhere?

1:08:28.526 --> 1:08:30.562
Jealous much?

1:08:48.479 --> 1:08:49.647
When did Kristi get here?

1:08:49.681 --> 1:08:51.114
- Kristi, let's go!
- Okay.

1:08:51.148 --> 1:08:53.484
Kristi, right now!

1:08:54.686 --> 1:08:56.353
Go.

1:09:03.695 --> 1:09:07.164
You're supposed to
use this stuff, right?

1:09:08.365 --> 1:09:09.399
Chris, come on.

1:09:09.433 --> 1:09:11.273
Do I look like I know
anything about gardening?

1:09:11.301 --> 1:09:12.369
Help me!

1:09:12.402 --> 1:09:16.507
Okay, all right, you're
totally stressing me out.

1:09:17.441 --> 1:09:19.477
Why are you even
doing this anyways?

1:09:19.510 --> 1:09:21.879
Maybe I'll
really love gardening.

1:09:21.913 --> 1:09:24.616
What do I ever do besides work?

1:09:24.649 --> 1:09:26.416
Not much lately.

1:09:31.522 --> 1:09:33.524
Seriously.

1:09:34.459 --> 1:09:36.226
What do you do?

1:09:36.259 --> 1:09:39.864
Besides mothering
that brat you birthed?

1:09:41.733 --> 1:09:43.501
Well...

1:09:43.534 --> 1:09:46.236
you care for the neighborhood
ill repute when his own family's

1:09:46.269 --> 1:09:48.606
disgraced by him.

1:09:49.741 --> 1:09:52.242
You can still move in, you know.

1:09:52.275 --> 1:09:53.778
And live in this pig sty?

1:09:53.811 --> 1:09:56.881
No, no, thank you.

1:09:57.682 --> 1:09:59.717
Actually, you know what?

1:09:59.751 --> 1:10:01.919
There is something that
you can do right now.

1:10:01.953 --> 1:10:03.453
What?

1:10:03.488 --> 1:10:04.922
Cook.

1:10:04.956 --> 1:10:06.323
Cook.

1:10:06.356 --> 1:10:07.458
, come on!

1:10:07.492 --> 1:10:09.460
I'll get right to it.

1:10:09.494 --> 1:10:11.629
Don't let it die.

1:10:16.901 --> 1:10:18.479
There's supposed to be
a liquor store up here that'll

1:10:18.503 --> 1:10:20.437
sell to us.

1:10:23.306 --> 1:10:25.610
What the hell were you
and Cheryl talking about?

1:10:25.643 --> 1:10:27.745
Why does it matter?

1:10:27.779 --> 1:10:29.847
I'm just...

1:10:31.516 --> 1:10:34.251
I'm so over it.

1:10:37.455 --> 1:10:40.558
I was talking to
Cheryl because...

1:10:40.591 --> 1:10:43.695
I took the Ag-Ed
internship and...

1:10:43.728 --> 1:10:46.363
I'm thinking about
joining the FFA.

1:10:46.396 --> 1:10:47.431
What?!

1:10:47.465 --> 1:10:48.833
Are you kidding?

1:10:48.866 --> 1:10:50.702
You're becoming one of them?!

1:10:50.735 --> 1:10:53.236
I'm not becoming
one of anything!

1:10:53.270 --> 1:10:55.372
You're becoming
an aggie asshole!

1:10:55.405 --> 1:10:56.708
You're such a sell-out!

1:10:56.741 --> 1:10:57.942
Sell-out?!

1:10:57.975 --> 1:10:59.987
You're the one who's turning
into some stupid Kristi clone!

1:11:00.011 --> 1:11:01.211
Hey!

1:11:01.244 --> 1:11:03.524
At least I'm not turning into
some loser who gets stuck in

1:11:03.548 --> 1:11:05.248
this stupid shit town
like everybody else.

1:11:05.282 --> 1:11:06.450
That's what I can never get!

1:11:06.484 --> 1:11:07.528
Why do you always say that?!

1:11:07.552 --> 1:11:08.986
What is so bad
about being here?!

1:11:09.020 --> 1:11:09.887
Look around!

1:11:09.921 --> 1:11:11.656
You're not better
than anybody else here!

1:11:11.689 --> 1:11:12.790
Fuck you, Kat.

1:11:17.360 --> 1:11:18.261
Great.

1:11:18.295 --> 1:11:20.598
How am I gonna get
to this open mic now?

1:11:20.631 --> 1:11:21.733
Are you serious?!

1:11:21.766 --> 1:11:23.534
What is your problem?!

1:11:23.568 --> 1:11:26.838
Do you have any idea
how much trouble I'm in?!

1:11:28.305 --> 1:11:29.741
Fuck her, right?

1:11:29.774 --> 1:11:31.809
You want a strawberry?

1:11:31.843 --> 1:11:32.677
Strawb?

1:11:32.710 --> 1:11:34.645
Hey!

1:11:35.713 --> 1:11:38.549
What's cookin', good-lookin'?

1:11:38.583 --> 1:11:40.818
License, insurance,
and registration, please?

1:11:40.852 --> 1:11:42.820
Hm, yeah.

1:11:42.854 --> 1:11:46.791
You know, I think I, um,
left it at home, actually.

1:11:55.466 --> 1:11:56.433
Kathleen!

1:11:56.467 --> 1:11:58.770
Whoa, whoa, whoa, ?

1:11:58.803 --> 1:11:59.637
Identification?

1:11:59.670 --> 1:12:00.505
That's my daughter.

1:12:00.538 --> 1:12:01.472
And we speak English.

1:12:01.506 --> 1:12:03.508
Okay, so don't
let me ask you again.

1:12:03.541 --> 1:12:06.477
- Can I see some identification?
- Dad!

1:12:07.478 --> 1:12:09.446
Perfect, now you got my
whole family in trouble.

1:12:09.480 --> 1:12:10.447
Who's in trouble?

1:12:10.481 --> 1:12:11.816
My dad, Abby!

1:12:11.849 --> 1:12:12.926
The cops can't do that, okay?

1:12:12.950 --> 1:12:14.317
They're not gonna take him in.

1:12:14.351 --> 1:12:15.987
Oh shit, your dad's illegal?

1:12:16.020 --> 1:12:18.321
- Kat, vamanos!
- Kathleen, now!

1:12:18.355 --> 1:12:20.491
Vamanos!

1:12:23.027 --> 1:12:25.763
We are so over!

1:12:37.440 --> 1:12:38.643
Okay.

1:12:38.676 --> 1:12:43.548
Kristi Lewis, Abby Evans, it
looks like we can't get a hold

1:12:43.581 --> 1:12:46.316
of either of your parents.

1:12:50.054 --> 1:12:50.822
You're here?

1:12:50.855 --> 1:12:52.757
Why didn't you
answer the phone?!

1:12:52.790 --> 1:12:53.825
What happened?

1:12:53.858 --> 1:12:56.426
I... I turned it off!

1:12:56.460 --> 1:12:58.371
There was an incident with
your daughter and her friends

1:12:58.395 --> 1:13:00.965
involving a stolen car.

1:13:05.136 --> 1:13:07.738
I'm letting her
off with a warning.

1:13:11.809 --> 1:13:12.910
Lower that!

1:13:12.944 --> 1:13:14.645
You stole a car?!

1:13:14.679 --> 1:13:16.446
I didn't steal it,
it was Stepdude's.

1:13:16.480 --> 1:13:17.582
Who?

1:13:17.615 --> 1:13:18.983
Never mind!

1:13:19.016 --> 1:13:20.985
Someone could have gotten hurt!

1:13:21.018 --> 1:13:22.987
Am I supposed to
ground you now?!

1:13:23.020 --> 1:13:24.856
Right.

1:13:24.889 --> 1:13:27.892
I want someone to ground you.

1:13:31.696 --> 1:13:33.664
- I'm sorry, what did you say?
- Nothing!

1:13:33.698 --> 1:13:34.999
Okay, I... I heard you.

1:13:35.032 --> 1:13:37.568
Help, the kitchen's on fire!

1:13:38.636 --> 1:13:40.771
Stop, stop.

1:13:41.438 --> 1:13:43.140
Hey, we are not done talking!

1:13:43.174 --> 1:13:45.408
So now you wanna talk?

1:13:45.442 --> 1:13:46.443
Whatever, I'm going out.

1:13:46.477 --> 1:13:47.879
Hey, the cops
just brought you home.

1:13:47.912 --> 1:13:49.547
Where the hell do you
think you're going?

1:13:49.580 --> 1:13:51.649
- Out!
- Abby!

1:13:52.717 --> 1:13:54.018
I'm going out with Dave, okay?

1:13:54.051 --> 1:13:55.620
There's an open mic tonight.

1:13:55.653 --> 1:13:56.888
Dave?

1:13:56.921 --> 1:13:58.990
So there's a guy.

1:14:00.191 --> 1:14:00.992
You're singing?

1:14:01.025 --> 1:14:02.627
Why didn't you
tell me any of this?

1:14:02.660 --> 1:14:03.494
Who are you?

1:14:03.527 --> 1:14:04.962
Who are you?!

1:14:04.996 --> 1:14:05.830
I'm figuring it out!

1:14:05.863 --> 1:14:06.797
Is that okay with you?

1:14:06.831 --> 1:14:08.766
It's a little late to
be figuring things out.

1:14:08.799 --> 1:14:10.034
Look...

1:14:10.067 --> 1:14:13.436
you get to wear what you want,
you get to listen to what you

1:14:13.471 --> 1:14:15.573
want, you get to
go where you want,

1:14:15.606 --> 1:14:18.042
because I couldn't.

1:14:18.075 --> 1:14:20.177
It really is just about you.

1:14:20.211 --> 1:14:21.112
You're not going anywhere.

1:14:21.145 --> 1:14:22.280
You know what?

1:14:22.313 --> 1:14:23.857
From now on, I want you to
tell me everywhere you're going!

1:14:23.881 --> 1:14:24.916
Okay.

1:14:24.949 --> 1:14:26.784
All the time!

1:14:26.817 --> 1:14:27.417
Ugh!

1:14:27.450 --> 1:14:29.787
We are not done yet, Abby!

1:14:29.820 --> 1:14:32.056
I want you to come to my
work tonight because we need to

1:14:32.089 --> 1:14:34.558
finish this talk!

1:14:36.160 --> 1:14:37.662
Ugh.

1:14:37.695 --> 1:14:39.830
You idiots!

1:14:41.699 --> 1:14:44.902
You know, you're
both exactly the same!

1:14:57.715 --> 1:15:00.051
Woohoo!

1:15:00.918 --> 1:15:02.687
- You ready?
- No.

1:15:02.720 --> 1:15:04.622
Come on!

1:15:04.655 --> 1:15:05.832
Hey, give us a
second, give us a second.

1:15:05.856 --> 1:15:07.024
No, come on!

1:15:07.058 --> 1:15:09.060
One second, one second.

1:15:09.260 --> 1:15:10.094
What's wrong?

1:15:10.127 --> 1:15:11.896
You know the song,
don't be nervous.

1:15:11.929 --> 1:15:14.799
No, it's not that, it's my mom.

1:15:21.205 --> 1:15:23.507
Let's go.

1:15:23.541 --> 1:15:26.110
Okay, but...

1:15:26.143 --> 1:15:29.246
can we please stop at
my mom's work first?

1:15:29.280 --> 1:15:31.048
- Yeah.
- Okay.

1:15:31.082 --> 1:15:32.917
Come on, come on, come on.

1:15:41.225 --> 1:15:42.293
Right?

1:15:42.326 --> 1:15:44.071
Stealing a car, being
brought home by an officer.

1:15:44.095 --> 1:15:45.596
I... I never did that.

1:15:45.629 --> 1:15:47.264
- I never did that!
- No.

1:15:47.298 --> 1:15:50.968
I just, like, I
can't with her right now.

1:15:51.702 --> 1:15:52.603
Hey, do you know
where my mom is?

1:15:52.636 --> 1:15:53.371
Oh, hey.

1:15:53.404 --> 1:15:55.673
- Yeah, she's in 3118.
- Thanks.

1:15:55.706 --> 1:15:57.875
You know, sometimes,
I... I think and I'm like,

1:15:57.908 --> 1:16:00.211
"If I could go back and
make a different choice,

1:16:00.244 --> 1:16:02.813
maybe...

1:16:02.847 --> 1:16:04.615
maybe I wouldn't be
a mother right now,"

1:16:04.648 --> 1:16:06.517
you know?

1:16:07.118 --> 1:16:10.721
Well, maybe I
wouldn't choose you either.

1:16:14.992 --> 1:16:15.760
Hey, Abby?

1:16:15.793 --> 1:16:18.129
No, no, Abby?

1:16:19.263 --> 1:16:20.164
Abby!

1:16:20.197 --> 1:16:21.232
- The second time.
- Yeah?

1:16:21.265 --> 1:16:23.100
You have to make
sure to slide up.

1:16:23.134 --> 1:16:24.769
Don't tell me
how to play the bass!

1:16:24.802 --> 1:16:26.704
Hey, I'm coming with you.

1:16:26.737 --> 1:16:27.772
- You wanna come?
- Yeah.

1:16:27.805 --> 1:16:29.774
- Really?
- Mm-hm.

1:16:29.807 --> 1:16:32.043
Well...

1:16:32.076 --> 1:16:35.012
You guys, time to celebrate!

1:16:35.880 --> 1:16:38.115
Abby, we're gonna pave the way.

1:16:38.149 --> 1:16:41.185
We're gonna pave the
way for something big,

1:16:41.218 --> 1:16:43.687
something innovative.

1:16:44.889 --> 1:16:46.791
You sure about this?

1:16:46.824 --> 1:16:50.261
Coming on tour with us,
that's what you want?

1:16:50.294 --> 1:16:51.929
Yeah.

1:16:51.962 --> 1:16:53.898
I'm sure.

1:17:06.043 --> 1:17:07.154
We're not gonna
get there in time, man.

1:17:07.178 --> 1:17:09.080
Well, whose fault is that?

1:17:09.113 --> 1:17:10.681
Not my fault this time.

1:17:10.714 --> 1:17:13.617
Well, for the first time.

1:17:13.651 --> 1:17:15.319
True.

1:17:16.787 --> 1:17:18.289
She's going to hate me forever.

1:17:18.322 --> 1:17:20.257
No.

1:17:21.192 --> 1:17:23.794
I didn't mean it.

1:17:24.061 --> 1:17:24.962
I was just venting.

1:17:24.995 --> 1:17:27.598
I know you were.

1:17:30.267 --> 1:17:31.836
What am I even doing?

1:17:31.869 --> 1:17:34.038
Oh, you're just being a mother.

1:17:34.071 --> 1:17:36.974
Nobody tells you what a
shitty job it actually is.

1:17:38.876 --> 1:17:39.910
Me?

1:17:39.944 --> 1:17:42.880
I'm getting out
of here tomorrow.

1:17:43.147 --> 1:17:45.049
Ow.

1:17:45.082 --> 1:17:47.751
I don't know about that.

1:17:50.421 --> 1:17:53.657
Let her make her
own decisions...

1:17:53.691 --> 1:17:56.160
this time.

1:17:58.229 --> 1:17:59.663
You think?

1:17:59.697 --> 1:18:01.132
Yeah.

1:18:01.165 --> 1:18:03.267
You love her.

1:18:03.300 --> 1:18:05.970
That's enough.

1:18:09.707 --> 1:18:12.943
Is that what
happened with your daughter?

1:18:12.977 --> 1:18:15.679
That's a longer story.

1:18:15.713 --> 1:18:18.415
You got me thinking.

1:18:18.449 --> 1:18:23.387
No reason I shouldn't pick
up the phone and call her.

1:18:25.389 --> 1:18:28.292
Then she'll come
back home, right?

1:18:28.325 --> 1:18:30.794
Maybe.

1:19:27.785 --> 1:19:29.753
Hey, uh, Abby's not home.

1:19:29.787 --> 1:19:31.889
Can... can you help me find her?

1:19:31.922 --> 1:19:33.891
No.

1:19:33.924 --> 1:19:34.693
Absolutely not.

1:19:34.725 --> 1:19:38.028
- C... come on, please.
- I... I...

1:19:38.062 --> 1:19:39.029
- Please.
- No.

1:19:39.063 --> 1:19:41.065
- Please.
- No!

1:19:47.938 --> 1:19:49.907
Yo, where's Dave?

1:19:49.940 --> 1:19:51.242
Dude, I don't know.

1:19:51.275 --> 1:19:53.344
Typical Dave.

1:19:54.546 --> 1:19:56.380
- Hey.
- Hey.

1:19:56.413 --> 1:19:57.458
I thought you
had taiko practice.

1:19:57.482 --> 1:20:01.085
I know but... Abby.

1:20:10.961 --> 1:20:12.464
Well, yeah, I
mean, I think we're...

1:20:12.497 --> 1:20:14.798
Doesn't it give
you that kind of song...

1:20:14.832 --> 1:20:16.133
- No.
- Yes.

1:20:16.166 --> 1:20:18.836
It freaks me out.

1:20:30.582 --> 1:20:32.550
Oh, shit.

1:20:36.320 --> 1:20:38.389
We're on.

1:20:39.524 --> 1:20:40.692
All right.

1:20:40.725 --> 1:20:43.294
- "Love Will Tear Us Apart."
- Where have you been, man?

1:20:52.870 --> 1:20:54.539
Okay.

1:20:56.006 --> 1:20:58.008
Okay.

1:21:30.908 --> 1:21:32.343
Stop, stop, stop!

1:21:32.376 --> 1:21:34.078
I... I'm sorry, can we just...

1:21:34.111 --> 1:21:36.213
Can we start over?

1:21:36.246 --> 1:21:37.948
Play from the verse.

1:21:37.981 --> 1:21:40.384
- Verse.
- Sorry.

1:21:41.118 --> 1:21:44.054
Come on, you can do this.

1:21:44.922 --> 1:21:47.391
Try it again without the intro.

1:21:48.325 --> 1:21:50.160
Come on, Abby.

1:22:02.940 --> 1:22:04.576
- Abby!
- I'll get her, wait, just...

1:22:04.609 --> 1:22:05.477
Abby!

1:22:05.510 --> 1:22:06.654
I don't wanna hear
it right now, Chris.

1:22:06.678 --> 1:22:08.388
- Did I even say anything?
- Hey, dude, watch it.

1:22:08.412 --> 1:22:09.980
Sorry about that.

1:22:10.013 --> 1:22:11.014
Look at this faggot.

1:22:11.048 --> 1:22:12.383
Haha, yeah, yeah, look at me.-

1:22:12.416 --> 1:22:13.917
Whoa, stop, Abby.

1:22:13.951 --> 1:22:14.985
- Who cares?
- I care.

1:22:15.018 --> 1:22:16.930
No, you know what they
say doesn't matter, right?

1:22:16.954 --> 1:22:17.722
It matters to me!

1:22:17.756 --> 1:22:20.257
No, Abby, what
matters is... stop!

1:22:20.290 --> 1:22:21.225
Look at this!

1:22:21.258 --> 1:22:23.060
Abby, what matters is
what I know to be true.

1:22:23.093 --> 1:22:24.161
Stop!

1:22:24.194 --> 1:22:26.498
You gonna protect
your little faggot friend?

1:22:27.431 --> 1:22:29.501
- Abby, d...
- Abby, what are you...

1:22:32.970 --> 1:22:34.539
Go head and try.

1:22:34.572 --> 1:22:35.939
Put it down.

1:22:35.973 --> 1:22:37.908
Abby!

1:24:39.296 --> 1:24:41.298
Abby!

1:24:41.699 --> 1:24:43.133
Abby!

1:24:43.166 --> 1:24:45.168
Hey!

1:24:45.637 --> 1:24:46.604
What are you doing up so early?

1:24:46.638 --> 1:24:48.773
You look like shit.

1:24:50.842 --> 1:24:52.342
You're just getting home?

1:24:52.376 --> 1:24:54.077
Damn!

1:24:54.111 --> 1:24:56.514
I bet that was fun.

1:24:57.782 --> 1:25:00.685
You live here now?

1:25:00.718 --> 1:25:02.286
Yeah.

1:25:02.319 --> 1:25:05.657
Yeah, my mom kicked me out
so I'm living with my aunt.

1:25:05.790 --> 1:25:07.291
Hey, come inside and meet Jax.

1:25:07.324 --> 1:25:09.460
I like your nose piercing.

1:25:15.600 --> 1:25:17.301
This is Jax.

1:25:17.334 --> 1:25:19.169
Um...

1:25:19.202 --> 1:25:21.305
Congratulations.

1:25:21.338 --> 1:25:24.241
I'm sorry I haven't
called or visited.

1:25:24.274 --> 1:25:25.577
It's okay.

1:25:25.610 --> 1:25:28.345
I'd rather be raging too.

1:25:31.482 --> 1:25:33.651
Can you believe it?

1:25:33.685 --> 1:25:35.385
Here.

1:25:35.419 --> 1:25:37.522
There, bubby.

1:25:37.555 --> 1:25:40.157
Me, a mom?

1:25:41.826 --> 1:25:43.393
I miss hanging
out with you guys.

1:25:43.427 --> 1:25:45.262
Yeah, um, I gotta go.

1:25:45.295 --> 1:25:46.464
Wait, stay.

1:25:46.497 --> 1:25:49.166
- Here.
- Oh...

1:25:50.768 --> 1:25:51.603
Look, I, uh...

1:25:51.636 --> 1:25:52.804
Check this out.

1:25:52.837 --> 1:25:56.741
I got this thing now called
WIC where they just give me free

1:25:56.774 --> 1:25:58.710
food.

1:25:59.176 --> 1:26:01.378
That's cool, right?

1:26:04.181 --> 1:26:06.651
At least I don't
have to go to school.

1:26:07.785 --> 1:26:10.488
Well, then, what
are you gonna do now?

1:26:15.660 --> 1:26:18.362
I don't know, my aunt, uh, she
has a part-time job down at Food.

1:26:18.395 --> 1:26:19.530
Mart.

1:26:19.564 --> 1:26:22.299
You know, she's been there
for, like...

1:26:22.332 --> 1:26:27.337
20 years, so she
thinks she can get me a job.

1:26:27.538 --> 1:26:28.640
- You know?
- Yeah.

1:26:28.673 --> 1:26:30.374
You know?

1:26:30.407 --> 1:26:31.909
Hey, do you want your paci?

I gave it to you?

1:27:18.856 --> 1:27:22.760
We used to listen to it all
the time together when you were

1:27:22.794 --> 1:27:24.662
little.

1:27:25.596 --> 1:27:28.398
Um, no.

1:27:33.471 --> 1:27:36.206
You're going somewhere?

1:27:47.618 --> 1:27:50.755

1:27:52.690 --> 1:27:55.358

1:27:56.426 --> 1:27:59.997
I didn't mean what

1:28:01.766 --> 1:28:04.367
I'm leaving.

1:28:07.772 --> 1:28:10.307
Leaving.

1:28:10.641 --> 1:28:12.910
Where?

1:28:14.779 --> 1:28:17.014
I can't be stuck here.

1:28:17.048 --> 1:28:20.317
I... I need... I need
to get out of here.

1:28:20.718 --> 1:28:23.453
I hate this place!

1:28:24.522 --> 1:28:27.658
And I hate everybody in it.

1:28:35.398 --> 1:28:38.803
Then, uh, you're
gonna need more stuff.

1:28:40.805 --> 1:28:43.406
What are you doing?

1:28:44.809 --> 1:28:47.011
I love you.

1:28:48.079 --> 1:28:52.683
I want you to be happy,
whatever that means for you.

1:28:52.950 --> 1:28:55.887
Make a choice for your life.

1:28:56.687 --> 1:28:59.824
I made a choice at your age too.

1:29:01.893 --> 1:29:04.695
And I don't regret it.

1:29:17.975 --> 1:29:20.044
Hey.

1:29:23.581 --> 1:29:27.785
You can always come back home.

1:29:48.005 --> 1:29:50.975
God...

1:29:51.008 --> 1:29:54.411
please let her come back.

1:30:47.665 --> 1:30:51.434
Do you really believe that
story about the Lone Woman?

1:30:51.469 --> 1:30:56.107
She jumped off a ship
just to save her kid?

1:30:56.140 --> 1:30:57.975
Are you kidding me?

1:30:58.009 --> 1:31:03.014
All romantic notions aside, a
mother's love is incomparable.

1:31:04.081 --> 1:31:07.952
Why, you been thinking about it?

1:31:08.819 --> 1:31:11.088
A little.

1:31:13.958 --> 1:31:15.793
I noticed your bag.

1:31:15.826 --> 1:31:18.428
Were you going somewhere?

1:31:25.569 --> 1:31:28.873
You know, you and I
are a lot alike, Abby.

1:31:28.906 --> 1:31:32.643
We're both natural-born rebels.

1:31:32.843 --> 1:31:35.479
That kind of
restlessness never dies.

1:31:37.248 --> 1:31:39.917
It's not a bad thing.

1:31:41.852 --> 1:31:44.622
Did you know I was
16 when I came here?

1:31:44.655 --> 1:31:46.657
Really?

1:31:49.193 --> 1:31:53.064
I left for a little, went
to school up in Berkeley.

1:31:53.731 --> 1:31:57.134
So why did you come back here?

1:31:58.135 --> 1:32:03.107
You know, we were
trying to change things...

1:32:03.140 --> 1:32:08.245
and then, I got involved
with some questionable people.

1:32:08.279 --> 1:32:11.816
I guess you can
say I lost my way.

1:32:12.616 --> 1:32:16.687
But even rebels need a
place to come home to.

1:32:18.022 --> 1:32:23.027
When you lose your
way... and you will...

1:32:23.828 --> 1:32:28.232
there is really only one place
where you kind find yourself.

1:32:55.926 --> 1:32:57.795
Hey.

1:32:59.063 --> 1:32:59.997
Look...

1:33:00.031 --> 1:33:03.067
Is there still
room for me in the Van?

1:33:03.667 --> 1:33:05.703
Really?

1:33:05.736 --> 1:33:07.705
Abby, that makes me so happy.

1:33:07.738 --> 1:33:10.775
It didn't mean anything and...

1:33:10.808 --> 1:33:12.977
I'm an idiot.

1:33:13.010 --> 1:33:14.712
Yeah.

1:33:14.745 --> 1:33:16.180
You are.

1:33:16.213 --> 1:33:20.885
Everything I ever
said to you was real.

1:33:22.820 --> 1:33:25.956

So what about seeing your dad?

1:34:21.212 --> 1:34:25.749
Um, I haven't heard from
my dad since I was seven.

1:34:39.697 --> 1:34:41.274
Hey, just think, Abby, you're
never gonna have to come back to

1:34:41.298 --> 1:34:44.168
this shithole town again.

1:34:45.035 --> 1:34:47.204
Place fuckin' stinks.

1:34:47.238 --> 1:34:49.373
Ick.

1:35:13.998 --> 1:35:15.866
Stop.

1:35:16.133 --> 1:35:18.669
Stop the Van.

1:35:37.354 --> 1:35:38.722
Abby, wait.

1:35:38.756 --> 1:35:40.057
Abby!

1:35:40.090 --> 1:35:41.325
Hey!

1:35:41.358 --> 1:35:43.461
Don't go!

1:35:43.495 --> 1:35:46.430
- I thought you liked me.
- I did.

1:35:55.239 --> 1:35:58.442
But I can't go with you.

1:36:00.512 --> 1:36:02.846
Wait.

1:36:04.381 --> 1:36:08.085
You know, you're amazing.

1:36:08.118 --> 1:36:10.721
Yeah, I know.

1:36:37.081 --> 1:36:42.086
This assignment was supposed to
be my Hometown History essay...

1:36:42.554 --> 1:36:47.791
but I'm gonna record it
because I have something to say.

1:36:47.825 --> 1:36:52.830
I've lived in this same house
in the same town with the exact

1:36:53.030 --> 1:36:56.333
same friends my whole life.

1:36:56.367 --> 1:37:00.938
But for some reason, I've always
felt like I didn't belong,

1:37:00.971 --> 1:37:03.440
like I was different.

1:37:03.974 --> 1:37:06.076
I... I always wanted out.

1:37:06.110 --> 1:37:11.015
But now, I'm not even
sure I know what that means.

1:37:11.048 --> 1:37:14.151
I thought that being
brave meant leaving,

1:37:14.184 --> 1:37:19.189
but staying and facing things...

1:37:20.257 --> 1:37:22.793
that takes guts.

1:37:29.601 --> 1:37:32.936

1:37:35.205 --> 1:37:38.976
And I don't know
what's gonna happen,

1:37:39.009 --> 1:37:41.479
and that's okay...

1:37:43.615 --> 1:37:48.819
'cause what I do
still have is a lot.

1:37:53.558 --> 1:37:56.327
I know I won't
stay here forever,

1:37:56.360 --> 1:38:00.331
and maybe some day, I'll go to
London or China or some place

1:38:00.364 --> 1:38:01.999
like that.

1:38:02.032 --> 1:38:06.170
But for now, this
is where I belong.

1:38:06.571 --> 1:38:11.275
And no matter what happens, I
know I can always come back home

1:38:11.308 --> 1:38:13.377
again.

1:38:14.646 --> 1:38:18.082
