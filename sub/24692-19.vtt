00:00.481 --> 00:03.146
In New York City's war on crime,

00:03.146 --> 00:06.261
the worst criminal offenders
are pursued by the detectives

00:06.261 --> 00:08.137
of the Major Case Squad.

00:08.137 --> 00:10.375
These are their stories.

00:15.857 --> 00:19.275
Headquarters will have
your car here in fifteen, honey.

00:23.311 --> 00:26.805
Remember. Blue shirt for TV
and no striped ties.

00:26.805 --> 00:29.137
They go fuzzy on camera.

00:30.477 --> 00:32.589
You call me when you get to New York.

00:32.589 --> 00:34.191
Copy that.

00:42.656 --> 00:45.105
Commander Nelson, lieutenant Hart,
with six tapings today,

00:45.105 --> 00:47.108
we will need to stay on schedule.

00:47.108 --> 00:49.625
Well, you know me, Barbara.

00:49.994 --> 00:51.873
Built for speed.

01:01.166 --> 01:03.476
Ms. Hart! Ms. Hart! Picture!

01:03.476 --> 01:05.840
Hey, Jess. Jess!

01:06.460 --> 01:10.052
- Step back.
- Oh, no. It's okay. I know him.

01:14.278 --> 01:15.929
Thank you, commander.

01:15.929 --> 01:18.529
Now, lieutenant Hart,
when you take off next month,

01:18.529 --> 01:21.875
you'll be the youngest astronaut
ever to go up in space.

01:21.875 --> 01:25.460
I'm grateful to women
like Sally Ride who paved the way.

01:25.876 --> 01:30.670
Now the world will be watching
and your first space flight, nervous?

01:30.670 --> 01:32.587
I'm in good hands.

01:37.019 --> 01:40.917
We have an 0600 pickup
right before the conference starts.

01:48.625 --> 01:49.908
Ten, that's me.

01:49.908 --> 01:52.037
And me.
So breakfast, 0500?

01:52.037 --> 01:53.515
Right. See you both there.

01:53.515 --> 01:55.309
Good night, commander.

01:57.988 --> 02:00.825
Yeah, hon, I'm exhausted.
Nonstop since we landed.

02:00.825 --> 02:02.628
Gotta get to bed.

02:03.152 --> 02:05.155
I love you too.

02:31.599 --> 02:33.544
Lieutenant Hart?

02:33.544 --> 02:36.070
- It's Barbara Lee.
- This isn't like her.

02:36.070 --> 02:38.453
- She's not answering her cell.
- Open the door.

ORIGINAL AIR DATE ON NBC: 2007/05/01

03:41.703 --> 03:45.990
We have a national space agency
conference here this weekend.

03:45.990 --> 03:47.597
Lieutenant Hart and commander Nelson

03:47.597 --> 03:50.317
checked in a day early
to do media appearances.

03:50.317 --> 03:52.229
When was the last time you saw her?

03:52.229 --> 03:54.599
Last night in the elevator around 11.

03:54.860 --> 03:57.742
Commander Nelson and I got off,
said good night...

03:58.003 --> 03:59.289
Jessica had two floors to go.

03:59.289 --> 04:02.113
I'll need to speak
with commander Nelson.

04:04.007 --> 04:05.524
Hey.

04:06.862 --> 04:08.655
A lot of rage.

04:08.655 --> 04:10.702
We have multiple stab wounds.

04:10.702 --> 04:12.280
Neck...

04:12.280 --> 04:15.047
chest area, stomach.

04:15.047 --> 04:16.296
Crime of passion?

04:16.296 --> 04:19.196
Maybe. Silk nightgown.

04:19.678 --> 04:25.486
Her face is swollen.
Irritation around the eyes.

04:26.892 --> 04:28.822
Pepper spray.

04:29.593 --> 04:31.583
It's an unusual murder weapon.

04:31.583 --> 04:33.571
It's a diver's knife.

04:34.360 --> 04:36.124
You can see it underwater.

04:36.124 --> 04:37.451
No forced entry.

04:37.451 --> 04:40.430
Her wallet's here.
Her jewelry, her laptop.

04:40.430 --> 04:43.415
She answered the door in her lingerie.

04:43.415 --> 04:45.520
She may've known her killer.

04:47.708 --> 04:51.061
Late night date? No.
She, uh, Jessica is disciplined.

04:51.061 --> 04:54.047
- Would she have gone out alone?
- Absolutely not.

04:54.047 --> 04:56.485
She knew we had a full day today.

04:56.485 --> 04:58.969
And what did you do last night?

04:58.969 --> 05:01.861
I was wiped, I hit my room.

05:01.861 --> 05:03.476
Called my wife.

05:03.476 --> 05:05.058
Sacked out.

05:05.058 --> 05:08.030
Jessica may have known her killer.

05:08.030 --> 05:12.196
Do you know if she had a boyfriend
or if she was seeing anyone in New York?

05:12.196 --> 05:15.190
I have no idea.
We keep things professional.

05:15.190 --> 05:16.938
And so did Jessica.

05:16.938 --> 05:19.707
Once she found out she was
on the short list for this mission,

05:19.707 --> 05:22.087
- she was all work.
- How about before that?

05:22.087 --> 05:26.056
She was engaged a few years back
to a civilian.

05:26.056 --> 05:29.294
He came by the TV studio yesterday.

05:29.681 --> 05:32.358
Really? Do you have a name?

05:32.358 --> 05:34.076
Matthew Shaw.

05:34.448 --> 05:36.543
He gave her flowers.

05:36.720 --> 05:39.368
Any idea where we can find him?

05:41.695 --> 05:43.886
Well, before yesterday,
I'd say about three years.

05:43.886 --> 05:46.676
But I just stopped by to say hello.

05:47.698 --> 05:51.035
I don't know about you,
but when someone breaks up with me,

05:51.035 --> 05:53.196
I don't make an effort
to see them again.

05:53.196 --> 05:55.318
Who says she broke up with me?

05:55.318 --> 05:56.410
Come on, Matt.

05:56.410 --> 06:00.348
Not many guys would walk away
from a woman like Jessica.

06:00.584 --> 06:03.330
- Even before she was famous.
- Well, I didn't want to.

06:03.330 --> 06:06.363
But when she got accepted
into the program, she changed.

06:06.363 --> 06:08.450
No, you mean
she chose Houston over you.

06:08.450 --> 06:12.379
I guess you don't realize what a woman
has to give up to become an astronaut.

06:12.379 --> 06:15.512
If you get listed for a mission
and become pregnant, you're out.

06:15.512 --> 06:17.324
Now, you could be listed
for two or three years

06:17.324 --> 06:20.403
before the mission even takes place.
It's a real pressure cooker.

06:20.403 --> 06:22.747
You were bringing flowers to your ex.

06:22.747 --> 06:26.077
Were you hoping to rekindle?

06:26.282 --> 06:28.410
Look, detective Eames...

06:28.410 --> 06:31.121
turns out I'm not her type
anymore, okay?

06:31.121 --> 06:33.149
I don't fit her image.

06:33.252 --> 06:34.681
Sounds calculating.

06:34.681 --> 06:36.792
Focused about everything.

06:36.792 --> 06:40.884
Career, friends, and...
even sex.

06:41.096 --> 06:43.500
Let me ask you something.
Where were you last night?

06:43.500 --> 06:45.209
I flew to Memphis at 9 P.M.,

06:45.209 --> 06:47.861
my nightly cargo route.
Just got back.

06:48.122 --> 06:50.012
There's my van.

06:59.575 --> 07:02.031
Time of death, midnight to 2 A.M.

07:02.031 --> 07:03.439
No defense wounds.

07:03.439 --> 07:05.578
Whoever did this caught her by surprise.

07:05.578 --> 07:07.564
Yeah, I smelled pepper spray.

07:07.564 --> 07:09.265
We found capsicum in her eyes.

07:09.265 --> 07:10.927
More than enough
to temporarily blind her.

07:10.927 --> 07:12.946
And give the killer his opportunity.

07:12.946 --> 07:15.674
And we also found semen
in her vaginal cavity.

07:15.674 --> 07:17.160
Some of the sperm is still motile,

07:17.160 --> 07:19.769
so she had sex some time
in the last 24 hours.

07:19.769 --> 07:23.349
Detectives, this is Mark Schaeffer,
director of public communications

07:23.349 --> 07:25.516
for the national space agency.

07:25.516 --> 07:28.161
My God, who would do this?

07:34.930 --> 07:36.275
We thought about extra security,

07:36.275 --> 07:39.054
but she was with
the commander, the publicist.

07:39.054 --> 07:43.494
Wait, you were concerned with her safety?
There were threats against her?

07:43.494 --> 07:45.464
She gets a lot of attention.
Hundreds of letters a week.

07:45.464 --> 07:47.990
The fresh face of the space program.

07:47.990 --> 07:49.950
Who knows what crazies are out there.

07:49.950 --> 07:53.996
We're thinking she may have been killed
by someone she was intimate with.

07:53.996 --> 07:55.251
Oh?

07:55.251 --> 07:57.881
Your agency keeps
a DNA database, doesn't it?

07:57.881 --> 08:00.855
Yes, to identify remains
in the event of a tragedy.

08:00.855 --> 08:03.608
We're going to need access to that.

08:04.501 --> 08:07.801
I can assure you none of our astronauts
had anything to do with this.

08:07.801 --> 08:10.213
It's a homicide investigation,
Mr. Schaeffer.

08:10.213 --> 08:12.375
Then investigate.

08:12.375 --> 08:16.790
When you have actual suspects,
we can revisit DNA access.

08:17.008 --> 08:21.484
It just seems like you're more worried
about Houston's reputation

08:21.484 --> 08:24.985
than who killed lieutenant Hart.

08:25.553 --> 08:27.678
That's not true.

08:27.678 --> 08:29.523
We're a family.
We look after each other.

08:29.523 --> 08:31.621
This has been a terrible loss
for all of us.

08:31.621 --> 08:35.065
So in this family of yours,

08:35.065 --> 08:38.298
would she have confided in anyone?

08:38.448 --> 08:42.804
Her flight trainer, Sandy Delgado.
She's like a big sister to Jessica.

08:42.804 --> 08:44.889
Is Sandy Delgado in Houston?

08:44.889 --> 08:48.410
No, she arrived here today
for our conference.

08:49.453 --> 08:51.249
Well, it's possible
she made a date for that night

08:51.249 --> 08:53.441
given the pressure she was under.

08:53.441 --> 08:56.110
I wouldn't blame her for wanting
to blow off a little steam and unwind.

08:56.110 --> 09:00.556
You're the second person
to mention pressure to us.

09:00.556 --> 09:02.917
It's a competitive environment?

09:02.917 --> 09:05.887
When I got my chance,
there were a few pilots who were jealous.

09:05.887 --> 09:08.004
And Jessica moved up
a lot faster than I did.

09:08.004 --> 09:10.571
Well, she's young and she's pretty.

09:11.655 --> 09:15.053
I guess that would cause
a lot of resentment.

09:15.053 --> 09:16.697
She ever mention any problems?

09:16.697 --> 09:18.796
Well, I guess it's not really a secret.

09:18.796 --> 09:22.580
One of our astronauts did write a complaint
to the astronaut selection board.

09:22.580 --> 09:24.841
'cause Jessica was chosen over him?

09:24.841 --> 09:26.883
Yes, but you have to understand
the disappointment.

09:26.883 --> 09:31.101
Only five to ten pilots
are chosen every two years.

09:31.101 --> 09:34.831
He was convinced he was the victim
of reverse discrimination.

09:35.745 --> 09:38.412
Is he in town for the conference?

09:39.294 --> 09:41.174
Who is he?

09:42.688 --> 09:44.992
Major Craig Hurley.

09:47.544 --> 09:49.442
Craig Hurley flew in
yesterday morning,

09:49.442 --> 09:50.825
checked into the hotel.

09:50.825 --> 09:53.191
He's not there now
and we can't locate him.

09:53.191 --> 09:56.596
He made several calls to
Jessica's cell phone yesterday.

09:56.596 --> 09:58.773
- And he didn't leave any messages.
- Nope.

09:58.773 --> 10:02.080
Maybe he lost patience.
Decided to confront her in person.

10:02.080 --> 10:04.047
What else do we know about major Hurley?

10:04.047 --> 10:06.774
We know what his life-long dream is.

10:06.774 --> 10:08.501
My lifelong dream?

10:08.501 --> 10:11.690
To go on a shuttle mission
and someday walk in space.

10:11.690 --> 10:12.768
That's original.

10:12.768 --> 10:15.726
Odds-on favorite to go on
the next shuttle mission

10:15.726 --> 10:17.621
until Jessica took his slot.

10:17.621 --> 10:20.197
But astronauts go through
extensive psychological testing.

10:20.197 --> 10:23.287
I would think major Hurley
could withstand being passed over.

10:23.287 --> 10:24.882
I wish that he would've
cracked up in space

10:24.882 --> 10:27.726
'cause they have a procedure for that.

10:27.726 --> 10:29.154
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

10:29.154 --> 10:31.423
"In the event of in-flight
psychological breakdown,"

10:31.423 --> 10:35.370
"astronauts should bind their crewmate's
wrists and ankles with duct tape,"

10:35.370 --> 10:39.670
"tie him down with a bungee cord
and inject him with tranquilizers."

10:39.670 --> 10:40.756
Yeah.

10:40.756 --> 10:42.379
Sounds enlightened.

10:42.379 --> 10:46.847
I take it no one ever voluntarily admits
to needing psychological help.

10:46.847 --> 10:48.371
Craig didn't.

10:48.371 --> 10:51.634
But he does have his favorite pastime.

10:51.634 --> 10:54.604
It helps him relax.

10:55.475 --> 10:58.550
My favorite hobby when I'm not dreaming
of going up in space?

10:58.550 --> 11:00.556
Deep sea diving.

11:02.652 --> 11:04.391
Deep sea diving.

11:04.391 --> 11:09.078
Just him, the deep blue sea,
and his diving knife.

11:17.429 --> 11:20.955
He gave you access to the DNA
of every astronaut

11:20.955 --> 11:23.679
who's here for the conference?
How did that happen?

11:23.679 --> 11:27.079
I had a reporter friend call Mr. Schaeffer
and ask him if it was true

11:27.079 --> 11:30.531
the agency was unwilling to cooperate
with a murder investigation.

11:30.531 --> 11:32.406
Ten minutes later, Houston called.

11:32.406 --> 11:34.021
They handed everything over to the ME.

11:34.021 --> 11:35.658
And when do we get the results?

11:35.658 --> 11:36.768
Some time today.

11:36.768 --> 11:38.673
Until then, I have
Mr. Schaeffer's assurance

11:38.673 --> 11:41.553
that none of his astronauts
will be leaving the city.

11:43.111 --> 11:47.717
For now, find out where major Hurley's
been in the last 24 hours.

11:49.868 --> 11:51.752
Where was I last night?
Same place I was today.

11:51.752 --> 11:53.349
Walking around Manhattan.

11:53.349 --> 11:56.590
- All night?
- Got back to my hotel around 4.

11:57.048 --> 11:58.303
You stop anywhere?

11:58.303 --> 12:00.688
Bought a hot dog near Central park.

12:00.688 --> 12:03.356
You have a receipt?
Did you use a credit card?

12:03.356 --> 12:05.876
- For a hot dog?
- Here, I can prove it.

12:05.876 --> 12:09.409
I walked approximately...

12:09.409 --> 12:12.854
22.6 miles from 8 P.M. to 4 A.M.

12:12.854 --> 12:14.600
That's some alibi.

12:14.600 --> 12:17.993
Detective, he doesn't need an alibi.
He hasn't done anything.

12:17.993 --> 12:22.848
Well, he did write a letter
of complaint to the agency

12:22.848 --> 12:26.715
that Jessica leap-frogged over him
to get on the mission.

12:26.715 --> 12:29.980
No, I was concerned
about her lack of experience.

12:29.980 --> 12:31.635
Safety of the flight crew.

12:31.635 --> 12:33.971
Oh, right.

12:33.971 --> 12:37.138
But you did tell your colleagues

12:37.138 --> 12:41.957
that the only reason why she got the job
is 'cause houston needed a pretty face.

12:41.957 --> 12:44.074
Well, if I did,
that was just venting.

12:44.074 --> 12:46.896
You've never vented to a coworker...

12:46.896 --> 12:49.594
about your boss, detective?

12:49.594 --> 12:53.835
Did you vent to Jessica too?
You called her three times yesterday.

12:53.835 --> 12:56.077
I just wanted to clear the air
about the letter I filed.

12:56.077 --> 13:00.201
Mmm, was that before or after
she blocked your emails?

13:00.569 --> 13:02.721
We have her laptop.

13:03.591 --> 13:05.332
Okay, so I may have
written her a few times.

13:05.332 --> 13:08.580
17 times since she was chosen
for the mission.

13:08.580 --> 13:10.609
She didn't answer!

13:10.609 --> 13:12.075
I thought there was a server problem.

13:12.075 --> 13:16.494
You're not very good at
taking a hint, are you?

13:17.250 --> 13:20.335
I guess you thought that
Jessica ignoring your calls meant

13:20.335 --> 13:23.649
that you should talk to
her in person in her room.

13:23.649 --> 13:27.429
No, I told you I was out walking.

13:27.429 --> 13:28.607
Helps me relax.

13:28.607 --> 13:31.224
You have other hobbies
that help you relax.

13:31.224 --> 13:32.425
Deep sea diving.

13:32.425 --> 13:35.255
Yes, I'm certified.

13:35.255 --> 13:37.851
It's dangerous stuff.
Carry a knife?

13:37.851 --> 13:40.489
Yes, two.

13:41.778 --> 13:44.106
Either of them look like this?

13:48.317 --> 13:51.080
This interview's over, detective.

14:01.502 --> 14:03.761
That didn't go well for him.

14:03.934 --> 14:08.092
Well, he's in a ultra-competitive
environment filled with type As.

14:08.092 --> 14:11.505
He's angry and obsessive.

14:11.505 --> 14:13.827
So am I, so are you.

14:14.384 --> 14:17.068
Does he have enough anger
to rape and kill a colleague?

14:17.068 --> 14:18.476
He didn't rape her.

14:18.476 --> 14:19.732
You think it was consensual.

14:19.732 --> 14:21.252
No, the DNA is back.

14:21.252 --> 14:24.679
Craig Hurley did not
have sex with Jessica Hart.

14:24.679 --> 14:29.027
It was her shuttle commander.
Luke Nelson.

14:29.831 --> 14:31.131
Go pay a visit to the commander.

14:31.131 --> 14:33.408
If these guys are
as toe to toe as you say,

14:33.408 --> 14:36.219
let him think you're asking
about Craig.

14:37.449 --> 14:38.824
Okay.

14:38.824 --> 14:40.928
Do you think I'm angry?

14:42.783 --> 14:46.105
The police just kept asking questions.
I had to give them Craig's name.

14:46.105 --> 14:50.299
I know. You did the right thing.
It's a murder investigation.

14:50.299 --> 14:53.502
I just can't believe
that Jess is dead.

14:57.276 --> 15:00.426
I know. I know.

15:06.371 --> 15:10.605
It's my wife.
I've got to get that.

15:13.850 --> 15:15.958
Hi, honey, how are you?

15:20.787 --> 15:23.353
What's the hardest part
about space travel?

15:23.353 --> 15:26.020
Hmm, well, going back to Earth.

15:26.020 --> 15:27.784
When you're up here,
you're in perfect harmony

15:27.784 --> 15:32.233
with your environment,
your colleagues, yourself.

15:32.740 --> 15:34.935
From the moment I touch down,

15:34.935 --> 15:37.600
it's hard not to think
of anything else but

15:37.600 --> 15:38.419
"when can I get back up?"

15:38.419 --> 15:40.025
It's always a waiting game.

15:40.248 --> 15:41.450
We just have to cope with that.

15:41.450 --> 15:44.425
Still, Craig has a lot more
experience than Jessica.

15:44.425 --> 15:46.329
It must've been hard.

15:46.329 --> 15:47.815
Craig knows the politics.

15:47.815 --> 15:50.424
There's not a chance
he'd kill her over that.

15:50.690 --> 15:57.370
Well, he certainly has
strong feelings towards Jessica.

15:57.786 --> 16:00.080
Do you think that they were
romantically involved?

16:00.080 --> 16:01.703
Absolutely not.

16:01.703 --> 16:05.387
The way Jessica was dressed,
she may have been expecting someone.

16:05.387 --> 16:09.973
Did she mention that to you when...
when did you say you last saw her?

16:09.973 --> 16:14.492
No, she didn't, and it was 2300 hours.
In the elevator.

16:14.492 --> 16:18.708
11, that's right.
You told us you went back to your room.

16:18.708 --> 16:20.111
And went straight to bed.

16:20.111 --> 16:22.315
What? Whose bed?

16:22.315 --> 16:24.564
The thing is we checked
your card key activity.

16:24.564 --> 16:27.608
You entered your room at 11:02.
But then you must've left,

16:27.608 --> 16:33.080
'cause then you re-entered at 12:14.

16:33.080 --> 16:35.240
Midnight booty call?

16:35.496 --> 16:38.145
That, that is not it at all.

16:38.145 --> 16:40.660
You know, one more thing, um...

16:40.959 --> 16:44.184
we found your semen
at the crime scene.

16:44.305 --> 16:47.064
I swear to God
I did not kill Jessica.

16:47.064 --> 16:49.996
Luke, you okay?

16:49.996 --> 16:52.734
Uh, yeah, hi, honey. Hi.

16:53.964 --> 16:56.699
I'm Edie, the commander's wife.

16:56.699 --> 16:58.571
You're detectives?

16:58.989 --> 17:03.626
The holster bulge,
plain clothes, tired eyes.

17:04.909 --> 17:07.463
You, what?
You were a detective? Or...

17:07.463 --> 17:09.598
No, just a mom.

17:10.002 --> 17:12.579
I'm gonna go down
to the precinct with them,

17:12.579 --> 17:15.017
- help with the investigation.
- I'll come too.

17:15.017 --> 17:17.892
Honey, I don't think
the detectives need your help.

17:17.892 --> 17:22.255
No, I insist.
You don't mind, do you?

17:22.970 --> 17:24.921
Absolutely not.

17:29.004 --> 17:30.836
Where's Edie?

17:31.561 --> 17:34.490
My partner is making her tea.

17:36.070 --> 17:39.038
Look, you're gonna have to trust me.
I'm gonna trust you.

17:39.223 --> 17:40.746
Do I need a lawyer here?

17:40.746 --> 17:43.235
Well, you've gotten off to a bad start.

17:43.235 --> 17:45.973
We know that Jessica asked
for two room keys.

17:45.973 --> 17:49.760
We know that you were involved with her.

17:49.760 --> 17:52.032
If you want to wait for a lawyer, fine.

17:52.032 --> 17:55.863
Or if you haven't done
anything wrong, start fresh.

18:05.856 --> 18:09.900
After I spoke to my wife,
I took the stairs up to Jessica's room.

18:10.492 --> 18:13.282
Opened the door and, uh...

18:14.936 --> 18:18.362
there she was in a pool of blood.

18:18.507 --> 18:20.142
Yeah, but you didn't call 911.

18:20.142 --> 18:22.695
- You didn't alert the hotel.
- I checked her vitals.

18:22.695 --> 18:24.057
Believe me, if she were alive,

18:24.057 --> 18:26.509
I would've moved heaven and Earth
to try to save her.

18:26.509 --> 18:29.061
But since she was already dead,
you figured,

18:29.061 --> 18:31.707
why jeopardize your career?

18:33.495 --> 18:35.453
Detective, I was trying
to spare my wife.

18:35.453 --> 18:39.483
Yeah, commander...
that was very thoughtful of you.

18:39.483 --> 18:42.087
It's impossible to be spared
in my position.

18:42.087 --> 18:44.474
Even astronauts like to gossip.

18:44.474 --> 18:46.326
What kind of gossip?

18:48.098 --> 18:53.748
There were rumors that Jessica and my Luke
were a little more than just co-pilots.

18:54.836 --> 18:56.807
That must be hard.

18:56.968 --> 19:01.681
People see the beautiful pilot,
the handsome commander.

19:01.681 --> 19:03.978
They jump to conclusions.

19:03.978 --> 19:05.655
I'm an astronaut's wife.

19:05.655 --> 19:09.729
Women are always slipping him
their phone numbers and hotel room keys.

19:10.273 --> 19:14.146
But I know deep down the commander
would never cheat on me.

19:14.146 --> 19:16.853
Jessica and I had sex
right after we checked in.

19:16.853 --> 19:20.044
We did our TV interview
and got dinner.

19:20.044 --> 19:21.343
And you went to separate rooms.

19:21.343 --> 19:24.417
There were no phone calls
between the two of you? No messages.

19:24.417 --> 19:27.762
Yeah, we prearranged.
She gave me her extra room key.

19:27.762 --> 19:31.588
That's smart.
Didn't want to leave a trail.

19:32.611 --> 19:34.136
I'm gonna need her key.

19:34.136 --> 19:36.653
That, I have it in my room.

19:36.933 --> 19:39.969
I just, you know, I went
straight back and I was, I was in...

19:39.969 --> 19:41.770
I was in shock.

19:43.749 --> 19:49.555
And then you pretended
to find her dead the next morning.

19:50.146 --> 19:52.942
You're a very good actor
for an astronaut.

19:52.942 --> 19:55.442
Look, I had no reason to kill Jessica.

19:55.442 --> 19:57.823
24 hours ago, I had the perfect life.
Great wife.

19:57.823 --> 20:00.246
My son's the captain of
the high school football team.

20:00.246 --> 20:01.981
Great job...

20:01.981 --> 20:05.515
Jessica, great co-pilot.

20:08.098 --> 20:12.260
Yeah. Yeah, it was the perfect,
uh, NSA relationship.

20:12.912 --> 20:15.182
Uh, meaning?

20:15.182 --> 20:18.558
NSA. No strings attached.

20:18.558 --> 20:20.185
Just sex.

20:22.974 --> 20:25.355
And your wife had no idea.

20:26.905 --> 20:28.836
No one did.

20:28.836 --> 20:33.463
We heard Jessica was capable
of using sex as career currency.

20:33.463 --> 20:35.483
Oh, you've been speaking to Sandy.

20:35.483 --> 20:39.018
Now, honestly, you'd think
Luke was her husband.

20:40.022 --> 20:42.491
Sandy Delgado, the lieutenant?

20:42.491 --> 20:45.962
Yes, she went on
my husband's last mission.

20:45.962 --> 20:49.529
When Sandy's marriage went sour,
she started leaning on the commander.

20:49.529 --> 20:52.306
So I befriended her myself.

20:52.306 --> 20:53.883
Keep your friends close.

20:53.883 --> 20:55.696
Something like that.

20:56.270 --> 21:00.388
She volunteered to keep an eye
on Luke and Jessica Thursday night.

21:01.756 --> 21:04.450
Oh, I thought all the other
astronauts arrived Friday.

21:04.450 --> 21:07.233
No, she was here.

21:07.597 --> 21:10.628
She saw them arrive,
she saw them eat dinner.

21:10.628 --> 21:13.572
She told me I had nothing
to worry about.

21:15.032 --> 21:17.972
Luke?
Weren't they talking to Craig?

21:17.972 --> 21:19.919
They may know about the affair.

21:19.919 --> 21:22.377
How? Luke and Jessica were discreet.

21:22.377 --> 21:25.859
We had to turn over our DNA database.

21:26.794 --> 21:29.348
Luke didn't use protection.

21:33.640 --> 21:39.461
No matter who asks you, you had no idea
Jessica and Luke were involved.

21:50.564 --> 21:53.820
New York Thursday night?
No, I was in Annapolis.

21:53.820 --> 21:54.921
Maryland? Why?

21:54.921 --> 21:57.407
The agency needed a speaker
at the naval academy.

21:57.407 --> 21:59.218
I flew to New York Friday morning.

21:59.218 --> 22:03.351
- Oh, here's my itinerary.
- Oh, great.

22:03.351 --> 22:07.652
The thing is, Edie Nelson told us you
called her from New York Thursday night.

22:07.652 --> 22:08.972
Why would she think that?

22:08.972 --> 22:11.381
'cause that's what I told her.

22:11.381 --> 22:13.408
See, Edie heard some cruel rumors.

22:13.408 --> 22:17.002
And I knew that they weren't true.
So I told her a little white lie.

22:17.002 --> 22:20.142
That you were here
keeping an eye on them.

22:20.356 --> 22:22.300
It seemed to reassure her.

22:22.300 --> 22:23.962
I know that's what I'd wanna hear.

22:23.962 --> 22:26.512
And you're sure that they weren't
having an affair?

22:26.748 --> 22:29.171
Jessica's not his type.

22:30.259 --> 22:33.731
Young, smart, beautiful.
I get that.

22:33.802 --> 22:36.355
Not every man has his mind
in the gutter, detective.

22:36.355 --> 22:38.890
Luke is an honorable man.
You can ask anyone.

22:38.890 --> 22:41.713
Then how would a rumor
like this get started?

22:42.781 --> 22:46.173
Craig.
He was trying to smear Jessica.

22:46.173 --> 22:48.475
To get her replaced on the mission.

22:48.475 --> 22:50.525
He's not above using a plausible lie.

22:50.525 --> 22:53.738
Sandy, Mr. Schaeffer
needs to speak to you.

22:54.596 --> 22:56.433
Excuse me.

23:00.351 --> 23:03.855
That's twice she has
pointed us towards Craig.

23:04.588 --> 23:06.359
Maybe she's protecting Luke.

23:06.359 --> 23:08.493
Well, if Craig knew Jessica
was sleeping with Luke,

23:08.493 --> 23:10.377
why didn't he tell us?

23:12.469 --> 23:14.809
Maybe he's protecting Luke too.

23:19.581 --> 23:21.370
What do you got?

23:21.370 --> 23:23.700
What does that do?

23:24.606 --> 23:27.547
Level 14.
Wow, you're in training.

23:27.547 --> 23:29.790
I like to be prepared.

23:29.790 --> 23:32.154
Is that in case
a position opens up, you know?

23:32.154 --> 23:36.363
I guess Jessica's death
is working out for you.

23:36.363 --> 23:40.444
Of course, being a murder suspect
might put a damper on that.

23:44.630 --> 23:46.797
I didn't kill Jessica.

23:48.250 --> 23:51.987
We believe you.
We think it was your commander.

23:52.277 --> 23:54.069
Luke? Why?

23:54.069 --> 23:55.698
You tell us.

23:57.253 --> 24:00.764
Eames, we are giving this guy
such a chance to tell us about the affair.

24:00.764 --> 24:03.451
I mean, why won't he help himself?

24:05.576 --> 24:07.597
Luke had nothing to do
with Jessica's murder.

24:07.597 --> 24:10.497
But he was sleeping with her.

24:12.613 --> 24:14.186
Okay.

24:15.303 --> 24:17.243
Why didn't you put that
in your complaint?

24:17.243 --> 24:19.235
If I blow the whistle on those two,
who looks good?

24:19.235 --> 24:22.313
Not the agency, not Luke,
and least of all, me.

24:22.313 --> 24:24.658
- You didn't mind hurting Luke's wife.
- What?

24:24.658 --> 24:26.813
We know that you told her
about Jessica.

24:26.813 --> 24:27.841
I did no such thing.

24:27.841 --> 24:30.591
I could care less about
who's sleeping with whom.

24:30.591 --> 24:33.056
- All you care about is the mission.
- Exactly.

24:33.056 --> 24:36.163
Oh, I'm surprised you
even knew about the affair.

24:36.163 --> 24:39.633
Sandy told me.
She wanted me to put it in the report.

24:39.811 --> 24:41.951
Why didn't she just
blow the whistle herself?

24:41.951 --> 24:44.275
She gets her head set on how she
wants to do something, that's it.

24:44.275 --> 24:47.864
You don't deviate.
She doesn't follow impulse.

24:47.864 --> 24:50.049
I... how so?

24:50.049 --> 24:53.811
Last time we were on orbiter training,
we had to improvise a procedure.

24:53.811 --> 24:56.263
She just kept saying,
"that's not how we practiced."

24:56.263 --> 24:58.261
I mean, she couldn't adjust.

24:58.261 --> 25:00.180
So she's rigid.

25:00.550 --> 25:03.239
As far as I'm concerned,
she's nutcase.

25:03.530 --> 25:06.928
Sometimes I wish they never
allowed women into the program.

25:07.445 --> 25:09.675
Just screws everything up!

25:12.260 --> 25:15.794
How do I cope with the physical
and psychological stress of training?

25:15.794 --> 25:18.035
I keep 100% focus on my mission.

25:18.035 --> 25:20.617
And I let nothing interfere with that.

25:20.617 --> 25:24.716
Space travel can bring unimaginable
benefits to mankind.

25:24.716 --> 25:28.293
Whatever toll it takes
on astronauts pales in comparison.

25:28.293 --> 25:30.237
Sandy told Craig about the affair.

25:30.237 --> 25:32.065
Told Edie there was no affair.

25:32.065 --> 25:35.601
Told us she wasn't in New York,
told Edie she was in New York.

25:35.601 --> 25:38.066
Is she a people pleaser or a liar?

25:38.066 --> 25:41.212
I checked Sandy's flight itineraries
over the past week.

25:41.212 --> 25:44.118
She did fly from Maryland to
New York on Friday,

25:44.118 --> 25:46.341
the morning after Jessica's murder.

25:46.341 --> 25:48.865
And when did she fly to Annapolis?

25:50.330 --> 25:54.973
Well, she checked into
her Annapolis hotel on Tuesday.

25:54.973 --> 25:59.687
But there's no record of a flight
from Houston to Maryland in her itinerary.

25:59.687 --> 26:01.924
Maybe she left it off.

26:02.537 --> 26:06.458
No, no.
Sandy's too meticulous.

26:06.458 --> 26:09.616
Maybe she didn't fly.
She drove.

26:10.753 --> 26:12.196
She had her car in Annapolis.

26:12.196 --> 26:15.371
She would have driven
three hours to New York,

26:15.371 --> 26:18.853
been here Thursday, like Edie said.

26:18.853 --> 26:22.311
And driven down to Annapolis in time
to be back here on Friday.

26:22.311 --> 26:25.228
And if she paid tolls by cash,

26:25.228 --> 26:27.471
no one would be able to place her here.

26:27.471 --> 26:29.636
Perfect cover story.

26:33.367 --> 26:36.079
Sandy's grounded.
She flew twice under commander Nelson,

26:36.079 --> 26:40.221
but on her last flight,
she had an unusually high heart rate.

26:41.735 --> 26:44.607
Well, what happens to an astronaut
when they get grounded?

26:44.607 --> 26:47.739
They work in mission control
or they help train new candidates.

26:47.739 --> 26:50.247
Is that what Sandy was doing
in Annapolis, training?

26:50.247 --> 26:52.620
No, she volunteered to give a speech
at the naval academy.

26:52.620 --> 26:54.318
She volunteered?

26:54.798 --> 26:58.424
Compared to being in orbit,
it's not exciting, but then, what is?

26:58.424 --> 27:01.750
We'll need to look at all the footage
from her last space flight.

27:01.750 --> 27:02.795
I'll see what I can do.

27:02.795 --> 27:05.051
Oh, good. Well, you can also...

27:05.409 --> 27:07.648
let us see her medical data.

27:11.881 --> 27:14.068
This morning, instead
of a beautiful sunrise,

27:14.068 --> 27:19.049
I was awakened by a collision
with a runaway air filter.

27:19.256 --> 27:21.364
That's why I don't wear
jewelry in space.

27:21.364 --> 27:24.757
Not even an earring.
'cause things fly loose.

27:24.757 --> 27:28.962
I think she looks fine just the way she is,
don't you agree, Houston?

27:29.945 --> 27:33.564
Let me guess, this is
when her heart rate went up. / Yep.

27:33.564 --> 27:37.165
Any indication Sandy was also
romantically involved with Luke?

27:37.165 --> 27:41.999
Well, when her husband left her,
she turned to Luke for comfort.

27:41.999 --> 27:44.631
Enough for his wife to take notice.

27:44.631 --> 27:48.341
And it was confirmed,
Sandy drove from Houston to Maryland.

27:48.341 --> 27:49.463
Yes.

27:50.073 --> 27:53.636
Then she could have driven to
New York in time to murder Jessica.

27:53.636 --> 27:56.360
Call Annapolis.
Get a warrant for the car.

28:10.673 --> 28:14.380
Oh, no, excuse me, sergeant.
Can I just... please.

28:16.007 --> 28:19.148
I've got rolls of quarters
and Mapquested directions

28:19.148 --> 28:21.624
from Annapolis to their hotel
in Manhattan.

28:21.624 --> 28:25.453
Well, so far, I've got
astronaut diapers.

28:59.859 --> 29:02.154
I've got a wig here.

29:03.715 --> 29:05.789
Sunglasses...

29:06.983 --> 29:08.743
gloves...

29:09.396 --> 29:11.233
pepper spray.

29:20.400 --> 29:22.791
Houston, we have a problem.

29:31.188 --> 29:33.610
What is this, a prop kit for murder?

29:33.610 --> 29:36.252
You don't know me.
I'm, I'm really a decent person.

29:36.252 --> 29:38.255
Oh, you're a decent person.
I don't do things like this.

29:38.255 --> 29:39.887
What is this? A diaper.

29:40.044 --> 29:43.609
What is this for? oh, that's to travel
to New York without having to stop.

29:43.609 --> 29:46.456
And I guess the wig
so that nobody would recognize you.

29:46.456 --> 29:48.375
And the pepper spray
so that you could blind her.

29:48.375 --> 29:50.062
Oh, yes, there's the knife.

29:51.140 --> 29:53.710
So everybody would think
that Craig stabbed her.

29:53.710 --> 29:55.369
I just wanted to scare her.

29:55.369 --> 29:58.480
No, you wanted to scare her
away from Luke.

29:58.649 --> 30:00.898
'cause you were jealous
of their relationship.

30:00.898 --> 30:02.516
What relationship?

30:02.516 --> 30:05.876
They didn't have a relationship.
He was using Jessica for sex.

30:05.876 --> 30:08.587
He didn't have feelings for her.
He loved me.

30:08.587 --> 30:10.433
Did he tell you that?

30:10.701 --> 30:14.035
I just knew. I knew.

30:14.197 --> 30:17.363
How? / That's enough, Sandy.
You don't have to say any more.

30:17.363 --> 30:19.962
They're gonna find out
when they read the emails.

30:22.520 --> 30:24.796
She's right, counselor.

30:27.250 --> 30:31.807
Luke sent me 214 just this month.

30:32.748 --> 30:34.667
I saved all of them.

30:36.746 --> 30:39.765
- He even bought me these earrings.
- When?

30:40.721 --> 30:43.035
For Valentine's day.

30:46.060 --> 30:48.917
Aren't you and his wife good friends?

30:50.500 --> 30:53.645
Yes, but it's difficult
because of Luke's feelings for me.

30:53.645 --> 30:56.356
He has to stay with Edie
'cause they have a son.

30:56.356 --> 31:01.051
And he is a good, honorable man.

31:01.051 --> 31:02.485
So what was he doing with Jessica?

31:02.485 --> 31:05.227
He tried to get out of that,
but she wouldn't let him.

31:05.227 --> 31:08.428
- She threatened to ruin him.
- And you needed to stop her.

31:08.428 --> 31:10.081
Yes.

31:10.081 --> 31:13.667
I completed the mission.

31:20.140 --> 31:23.112
Uh, the mission...
to kill Jessica.

31:23.112 --> 31:26.699
That's enough, Sandy.
I'm gonna have to stop you.

31:39.991 --> 31:45.695
¢Ü How I wonder what you are ¢Ü

31:45.695 --> 31:51.165
¢Ü up above the world so high ¢Ü

31:51.165 --> 31:53.643
- ¢Ü like a diamond... ¢Ü
- Is she singing in there?

31:53.643 --> 31:57.457
Maybe laying the groundwork
for an insanity defense.

31:57.457 --> 32:00.561
So Sandy killed Jessica.
Said she did it for Luke.

32:00.561 --> 32:03.905
Is it possible they were
acting in concert with each other?

32:03.905 --> 32:07.027
I don't think she acts
in concert with anyone.

32:07.027 --> 32:11.039
But it's hard to believe that
she has a relationship with Luke.

32:11.472 --> 32:15.877
Well, I guess we'll learn more
when we get his 214 emails.

32:20.379 --> 32:23.345
"The idea of going into space
with Jessica instead of you"

32:23.345 --> 32:25.601
"is so wrong on so many levels."

32:25.601 --> 32:28.432
"I know it may sound terrible,
but I wish she were dead."

32:28.432 --> 32:30.322
"Then we could be together."

32:30.542 --> 32:32.141
I did not write a word of that.

32:32.141 --> 32:36.097
They were sent from your Hotmail account
from internet cafes in Houston.

32:36.097 --> 32:37.927
I don't, I don't
have a hotmail account.

32:37.927 --> 32:41.704
And I don't have time
to sit in internet cafes.

32:41.704 --> 32:44.259
Oh, but you do have time
to have an affair.

32:44.259 --> 32:47.955
Everybody at the agency tells us
how discreet you and Jessica were.

32:47.955 --> 32:50.771
My client told you he did not
send these. End of story.

32:50.771 --> 32:53.783
Did he send Sandy emerald earrings?

32:53.783 --> 32:56.585
No, that was Jessica.

32:56.585 --> 32:58.971
For her birthday a few months ago.

32:58.971 --> 33:02.589
- From where?
- Blue Nile.

33:02.589 --> 33:06.316
You can check my credit card.
Matter of fact, they double-billed me.

33:06.316 --> 33:08.571
I called them
and they credited my account.

33:08.571 --> 33:10.549
My client has been as cooperative
as he can

33:10.549 --> 33:13.499
- from the beginning.
- No, actually, he's lied a lot.

33:13.499 --> 33:17.280
And I'm still waiting on that key
to Jessica's room.

33:19.522 --> 33:24.133
Uh, that card key has...

33:24.906 --> 33:26.185
it's disappeared.

33:26.185 --> 33:28.612
I don't know, I don't know
what's going on here.

33:28.612 --> 33:32.233
But someone is trying to frame me.

33:33.736 --> 33:35.494
Can I have a moment?

33:47.191 --> 33:51.890
We just got word that Sandy
has tested positive for steroids.

33:51.890 --> 33:55.988
Don't tell me her lawyer's
claiming 'roid rage as a defense?

33:55.988 --> 33:58.901
Get this. Sandy won't let her.

34:01.480 --> 34:05.296
I never, never took steroids.

34:09.953 --> 34:13.378
- You're itchy?
- They won't give me my moisturizer.

34:13.378 --> 34:16.391
I really need my moisturizer.

34:16.391 --> 34:19.518
Hey, do you think you could
do something about that?

34:20.373 --> 34:23.007
You suffer from dry skin?

34:24.275 --> 34:27.396
They wouldn't let me have it
and I need it.

34:28.011 --> 34:31.098
Space travel dries your skin.

34:31.098 --> 34:32.815
We can arrange
to get you some lotion.

34:32.815 --> 34:37.299
No! I need my lotion.

34:38.853 --> 34:41.043
Your lotion is special?

34:44.018 --> 34:46.139
Luke gave it to me.

34:46.139 --> 34:48.954
He sent it to me for Christmas.

34:49.130 --> 34:51.406
'cause he loves me.

34:51.406 --> 34:55.859
'cause he loves me and he knows
that I need it for my dry skin.

35:03.043 --> 35:06.350
The lotion tested positive
for nandrolone decanoate.

35:06.350 --> 35:08.366
That's a fancy term
for anabolic steroids.

35:08.366 --> 35:10.597
- Gym candy.
- Yeah, that's the street name.

35:10.597 --> 35:13.639
It's easy to bring in from Mexico where
you don't even need a prescription for it.

35:13.639 --> 35:15.440
And side effects include aggression.

35:15.440 --> 35:20.396
Extreme mood swings, paranoid jealousy,
irritability, delusions.

35:20.674 --> 35:22.850
The drug can trigger
manic-like levels of violence

35:22.850 --> 35:25.495
in someone who wouldn't harm a fly.

35:27.797 --> 35:32.811
So you're saying if Sandy's lotion
hadn't been spiked with steroids,

35:32.811 --> 35:35.231
- she wouldn't have murdered Jessica?
- Could be the steroids,

35:35.231 --> 35:38.488
could be 'cause her husband left her
and the agency grounded her.

35:38.488 --> 35:43.029
You know, she's obsessed
with being a good girl.

35:43.029 --> 35:45.308
Following protocol.

35:45.730 --> 35:48.721
This act of violence was
completely out of character.

35:48.721 --> 35:51.127
Or she's delusional.
At the very least,

35:51.127 --> 35:54.801
she's an intensely competitive type-A
personality under enormous pressure.

35:54.801 --> 35:56.441
Yeah, so am I, so are you.

35:57.182 --> 36:01.257
Anyway, someone could have noticed
her emotional state and stirred her up.

36:01.257 --> 36:02.869
Someone. Luke.

36:02.869 --> 36:05.544
He wrote her the letters,
he gave her the earrings, the lotion.

36:05.544 --> 36:08.464
Luke swears he didn't send any of it.

36:08.464 --> 36:10.368
Does anyone believe him?

36:12.590 --> 36:14.884
I've always hungered
to explore the unknown.

36:14.884 --> 36:17.796
To find out if there really
is life beyond ours.

36:17.796 --> 36:20.469
I'm thrilled to begin my quest.

36:21.657 --> 36:24.476
Jessica Hart's dream was cut short.

36:24.476 --> 36:28.376
But she touched all who
got to know her and work with her.

36:28.376 --> 36:32.093
Commander Nelson will
share a few words about Jessica.

36:36.617 --> 36:38.230
Commander.

36:38.933 --> 36:41.501
Sorry to interrupt you.
We're gonna have to talk to you.

36:41.501 --> 36:45.749
Now? / Unless you want us
to arrest you here in front of everyone.

36:49.653 --> 36:55.056
Let's jump ahead to our next speaker.
Her training partner Mike Dolan.

37:03.500 --> 37:05.906
I can't believe you're taking
Sandy's word on any of this.

37:05.906 --> 37:07.174
What are you doing?

37:07.174 --> 37:10.097
We're arresting your husband
for the murder of Jessica Hart.

37:10.097 --> 37:11.890
No, that's impossible.
Stop them.

37:11.890 --> 37:14.885
You already arrested Sandy.
How much damage do you intend to cause?

37:14.885 --> 37:16.706
We don't think Sandy acted alone.

37:16.706 --> 37:20.303
We can place Luke in Jessica's room
the night of the murder.

37:20.303 --> 37:23.066
I told you, she was gone already
when I got there.

37:23.066 --> 37:25.504
Yes, but you also told us that
you weren't involved with Sandy.

37:25.504 --> 37:27.577
And yet you wrote her
hundreds of emails.

37:27.577 --> 37:29.824
I told you,
I never wrote any of those.

37:29.824 --> 37:32.288
She's crazy. Sandy probably sent
those emails to herself.

37:32.288 --> 37:33.748
From Luke's email account?

37:33.748 --> 37:35.549
He works with rocket scientists.

37:35.549 --> 37:38.069
I think they could set up
a fake email account in his name.

37:38.069 --> 37:39.917
Who would do that? Why?

37:39.917 --> 37:42.585
Somebody's jealous.
Somebody's trying to smear my husband.

37:42.585 --> 37:47.508
No, no. He was having affairs
with Jessica and Sandy.

37:47.508 --> 37:51.652
We have dozens of calls
from his cell phone to both of them.

37:51.652 --> 37:53.058
They're lying.
Don't believe them.

37:53.058 --> 37:54.944
- I know they are.
- Yeah, you do, don't you?

37:54.944 --> 37:57.610
'Cause you check
his phone calls at night.

37:59.018 --> 38:02.527
Right? She check your collar
for lipstick stains?

38:02.527 --> 38:03.970
You check his credit card bills.

38:03.970 --> 38:05.548
- I do not.
- You don't?

38:05.548 --> 38:08.802
Then you don't know about the earrings
he sent to Jessica and Sandy.

38:08.802 --> 38:10.901
I never sent anything to Sandy.

38:10.901 --> 38:14.091
Someone did.
From your account.

38:14.091 --> 38:18.179
Fake email account's one thing,
but someone used your credit card...

38:18.179 --> 38:21.534
only once to send a gift to Sandy.

38:22.280 --> 38:24.395
Now, if you weren't
in love with Sandy,

38:24.395 --> 38:29.180
someone spent an awful lot of time
to make Sandy think...

38:29.180 --> 38:31.110
that you were.

38:31.652 --> 38:34.157
Now, who would do
something like that?

38:35.387 --> 38:36.605
I can't imagine.

38:36.605 --> 38:40.048
You also sent lotion to Sandy
that was laced with steroids.

38:40.048 --> 38:42.758
Enough to cause her violent attack.

38:42.758 --> 38:46.231
- Steroids?
- Yeah, anabolic, you know?

38:46.231 --> 38:47.898
The kind that...

38:48.550 --> 38:50.186
that high school athletes use.

38:50.186 --> 38:52.620
Your son was a linebacker.

38:52.620 --> 38:54.533
Did he ever use steroids?

38:54.533 --> 38:58.036
My wife caught him with them once,
but I read him the riot act.

38:58.036 --> 39:00.058
I never sent Sandy cream.

39:00.058 --> 39:01.601
Then someone's setting you up.

39:01.601 --> 39:05.346
Someone who wanted both of
these women out of your life.

39:07.195 --> 39:11.337
Think about it, Luke.
Anyone come to mind?

39:15.650 --> 39:19.718
It must have been Craig.
He probably gave Sandy the diver's knife.

39:19.718 --> 39:21.885
Luke, you know me.
Not in a million years.

39:21.885 --> 39:24.725
He was jealous of Jessica.
She took his slot.

39:24.725 --> 39:27.384
You know how obsessive he is.

39:32.982 --> 39:34.013
Excuse me, Mrs. Nelson.

39:34.013 --> 39:36.903
Now, you would have made
a really good detective.

39:36.903 --> 39:38.949
But Craig is not the guy.

39:41.762 --> 39:44.217
Do you have any other theories?

39:47.906 --> 39:50.468
I have one.

39:51.426 --> 39:54.104
You knew that Jessica and Luke
were having an affair, right?

39:54.104 --> 39:56.005
You knew that Sandy
had a crush on him?

39:56.005 --> 39:57.482
You brought her into your home.

39:57.482 --> 39:59.413
She was lonely.
I felt for her.

39:59.413 --> 40:02.051
And you weren't
trying to manipulate her?

40:02.326 --> 40:07.641
Oh, well, whoever wrote the emails
knew an awful lot about Luke's life.

40:07.641 --> 40:09.210
Craig's the letter writer.

40:09.210 --> 40:12.199
He wrote to Jessica and he wrote
to the complaint board.

40:12.199 --> 40:18.613
No. Those emails,
they were written in... in Luke's voice.

40:20.859 --> 40:27.315
I don't mean to insult you, but Craig's not
really observant about emotional life.

40:28.469 --> 40:32.750
But you... You knew that you were
losing Luke to Jessica.

40:33.128 --> 40:34.931
I wasn't worried.

40:34.931 --> 40:37.215
These women, they all throw
themselves at my husband.

40:37.215 --> 40:39.697
And they all want what's mine.

40:39.697 --> 40:42.596
Maybe that's why you've always
been so vigilant.

40:42.596 --> 40:46.049
It's tough being a wife and mother.

40:46.049 --> 40:47.699
Going through your son's drawers,

40:47.699 --> 40:51.951
your husband's phone records,
emails, bills...

40:53.088 --> 40:57.212
everything I've ever done,
I've done for my family.

41:02.097 --> 41:06.368
Luke, was I just supposed
to just sit back and let us be destroyed?

41:06.368 --> 41:08.182
What do you think you did?

41:08.182 --> 41:12.079
He's lost his career.
That's over.

41:12.079 --> 41:14.586
He's under arrest for murder.

41:14.586 --> 41:17.107
You drove Sandy to a psychotic break.

41:17.107 --> 41:21.176
You know that she played with her mind.
You drugged her.

41:21.349 --> 41:25.838
You convinced Sandy to kill Jessica
so that she could be with Luke.

41:25.838 --> 41:28.442
These women underestimated me.

41:28.442 --> 41:30.448
They thought I was
just some Texas housewife

41:30.448 --> 41:33.838
who had no idea they're trying
to steal my husband.

41:33.838 --> 41:35.730
Arrest her.

41:37.641 --> 41:40.357
The commander had nothing
to do with this.

41:40.357 --> 41:42.437
It's all me.

41:44.121 --> 41:45.931
Edie.

41:46.504 --> 41:48.416
No, don't, don't worry.

41:48.416 --> 41:51.679
Luke, as long as there's a jury
with wives and mothers on it,

41:51.679 --> 41:53.437
I'll be okay.

41:53.437 --> 41:57.552
They'll understand. They'll understand
I was just protecting what's mine.
