00:11.261 --> 00:13.263
- What are you doing here?

00:13.263 --> 00:15.265
- You are my patient.

00:15.265 --> 00:17.100
- Wait, no.
You're--you're so fucking fired.

00:18.810 --> 00:22.105
- Only your mother can fire me.
It's her checks.

00:22.105 --> 00:24.607
- Well, you're a fucking
traitor. How could you let her
talk you into this?

00:24.607 --> 00:26.109
- It wasn't hard.

00:26.109 --> 00:29.029
Once upon a time,
you tried to kill yourself,

00:29.029 --> 00:31.656
and you only stopped when your
brother beat you to the punch.

00:31.656 --> 00:35.535
Also, the mugger
you could've given 20 bucks to,

00:35.535 --> 00:38.163
instead you gave her a lecture,

00:38.163 --> 00:40.290
and she stabbed your
date in the colon.

00:40.290 --> 00:42.333
- It nicked her colon.

00:42.333 --> 00:44.419
And that turned out really
good for her. Really good.

00:44.419 --> 00:45.712
Still not my favorite.

00:45.712 --> 00:49.049
You promised your workers
raises and pensions,

00:49.049 --> 00:51.426
that you couldn't afford to.

00:51.426 --> 00:54.137
- That was cruel.

00:54.137 --> 00:57.849
- I wasn't trying to be cruel,
I was trying to help them.

00:57.849 --> 00:59.893
- Yeah, I don't know.
I'm old school.

00:59.893 --> 01:02.270
When you promise something
that you can't deliver on,

01:02.270 --> 01:04.272
it's a mortal sin.

01:04.272 --> 01:08.943
♪ Now, now,
now, now, now ♪

01:08.943 --> 01:14.074
- You have got to be the
worst psychiatrist of all time.

01:14.074 --> 01:15.992
I'm serious.
Kay?

01:15.992 --> 01:19.412
You are the fucking Bill
Belichick of shitty shrinks.

01:19.412 --> 01:21.706
All right? Why is it that
every time I talk to you,

01:21.706 --> 01:23.666
I walk away feeling
worse about myself.

01:25.376 --> 01:27.921
- I'm not here
'cause your mom wants me here.

01:29.589 --> 01:32.425
I'm trying to get you
to be honest with yourself.

01:32.425 --> 01:35.970
I don't care about trying to
make you feel good about
yourself.

01:37.931 --> 01:39.641
- You know, I had a
kid like you once...

01:42.102 --> 01:44.813
Always downbeat,
always miserable.

01:44.813 --> 01:48.399
Miserable just like you,
and I tried to build him up.

01:48.399 --> 01:50.568
"Hey, you're funny.
You're smart."

01:50.568 --> 01:51.903
You know?
"You're thoughtful.

01:51.903 --> 01:54.781
You're even kind."

01:54.781 --> 01:56.282
Didn't work.

01:56.282 --> 01:59.160
Only after he was
gone did I realize

01:59.160 --> 02:03.456
you can't make people
feel better about themselves,

02:03.456 --> 02:07.919
but you can try to get them
to be honest with themselves.

02:07.919 --> 02:11.965
You have a voice

02:11.965 --> 02:14.134
inside you that's
telling you the truth,

02:14.134 --> 02:16.427
and if you listen to it,
you'd be amazed...

02:18.513 --> 02:20.390
At the person that
you really are.

02:27.897 --> 02:29.941
Okay, so you had one patient
who it didn't work out for.

02:32.068 --> 02:34.487
- He wasn't a patient.

02:41.911 --> 02:44.122
Your mother tells me that, uh...

02:46.624 --> 02:50.253
You stopped reading your--
your brother's letters.

02:50.253 --> 02:52.964
- What's the point?

02:52.964 --> 02:55.633
- Yeah.
Yeah, I understand.

02:55.633 --> 02:58.428
These hurt.
I read them all.

03:00.471 --> 03:03.183
- I don't need to go through
this again. I know what they
say.

03:03.183 --> 03:06.060
- No, not all of them.
Just the one on the top.

03:21.826 --> 03:23.703
- There's a date on it.

03:30.293 --> 03:32.795
- It's the day he got out.

03:32.795 --> 03:34.297
It's the day he jumped.

03:37.425 --> 03:38.843
Wh--why?

03:42.263 --> 03:45.391
- I think he loved you, and he
didn't want you to suffer
anymore.

03:57.654 --> 03:59.739
Why--why would he kill himself
when he was finally free?

04:01.908 --> 04:05.662
- Why don't you be happy
with he loved you?

04:09.999 --> 04:11.960
-
Fuck...

04:11.960 --> 04:13.378
Sorry.
I'm sorry, I...

04:22.929 --> 04:24.931
- You gonna be all right?

04:24.931 --> 04:27.058
- Yeah.

04:27.058 --> 04:29.227
Uh, thanks.
Thanks, Doc.

04:29.227 --> 04:30.687
- Ah, thank you.

04:32.397 --> 04:34.732
Comparing me to Bill Belichick?

04:34.732 --> 04:36.401
He'll be in the Hall
of Fame one day.

04:51.291 --> 04:52.542
Oh, there he is.

04:52.542 --> 04:54.502
Ah!

04:54.502 --> 04:55.753
- What, they told me you guys
were waiting out here.

04:55.753 --> 04:57.005
Why didn't you come inside?

04:59.215 --> 05:01.801
Crazy people freak
me the fuck out, man.

05:01.801 --> 05:03.177
Except you.

05:03.177 --> 05:05.763
I am so sorry, Eddy.

05:05.763 --> 05:07.223
- It's, uh, it's all right, Ma.

05:07.223 --> 05:09.600
I mean, you putting me in there
against my will,

05:09.600 --> 05:11.978
that was a little fucked up,
but I know you were

05:11.978 --> 05:13.313
just trying to do what you
thought was best for me.

05:13.313 --> 05:15.440
- I'm not sorry about that.

05:15.440 --> 05:17.775
You belonged in there.
You were acting nuts.

05:17.775 --> 05:20.153
I'm sorry for not
believing in you.

05:20.153 --> 05:22.447
For not believing in your plan
for the company.

05:22.447 --> 05:25.241
Arthur did a deep dive
into your proposal.

05:25.241 --> 05:27.285
He said your numbers work out.

05:27.285 --> 05:30.580
- Fuck Arthur.
Of course my numbers check out.

05:30.580 --> 05:33.791
- Well, I mean, not the first
year. We would lose a little,
and--

05:33.791 --> 05:36.169
- Well, yeah, but that's--that's
normal. We might lose some the
second year too.

05:36.169 --> 05:38.755
- But your five-year deal
with the employees?

05:38.755 --> 05:40.256
It's a big win-win
for everybody.

05:40.256 --> 05:42.091
- Exactly.

05:42.091 --> 05:44.927
What--what about Roger Becker.
He's--he's okay with it?

05:44.927 --> 05:47.638
- No.
Unfortunately, he's not.

05:47.638 --> 05:49.766
So I told him to fuck off.

05:49.766 --> 05:53.144
- Oh-ho, Mrs. Poole.
You got some sack on you.

05:53.144 --> 05:55.104
I love that.
- Thank you, Hal.

05:55.104 --> 05:56.272
That's just what every woman
wants to hear.

05:59.442 --> 06:00.985
- So, what we're--
we're keeping the company?

06:00.985 --> 06:02.779
- And the employees.

06:02.779 --> 06:05.698
But I need you to commit
to running it with me.

06:08.659 --> 06:10.370
- Yeah.
I'd like that.

06:10.370 --> 06:11.287
- Really?

06:13.373 --> 06:15.208
- But, um, I'm
gonna need 30 days.

06:15.208 --> 06:16.626
- What the--what?
Why?

06:18.211 --> 06:20.004
- I'm not leaving.

06:20.004 --> 06:23.674
- Edward, don't be ridiculous.
The 72 hours are up.

06:23.674 --> 06:26.344
The doctor declared you
not insane. Let's go home.

06:26.344 --> 06:28.638
- Uh, no, I'm gonna stay
a little bit longer.

06:28.638 --> 06:31.349
This place, it's, uh-- it's
helping me figure out some shit.

06:33.476 --> 06:35.895
- But, Ed, what about Kendra,
man? I mean, she's getting
married tomorrow.

06:35.895 --> 06:39.315
We-- - I know, but
I gotta let that go.

06:39.315 --> 06:40.733
Kay, she's--she's not
fucking right for me.

06:40.733 --> 06:41.984
You guys know that.

06:41.984 --> 06:43.861
- So what you're saying is,

06:43.861 --> 06:46.489
you're not gonna go make an ass
out of yourself by breaking up a
wedding?

06:46.489 --> 06:47.615
- I decided not to.
No.

06:49.283 --> 06:50.827
Edward, I need you.

06:50.827 --> 06:52.995
The company needs you.

06:52.995 --> 06:54.956
- And I'll be back eventually.
Ugh.

06:54.956 --> 06:56.916
- And I'm gonna be
better than ever.

06:56.916 --> 07:00.086
- Edward!
- Oh, wait, you're serious!

07:00.086 --> 07:01.879
You're actually
going back in there?

07:01.879 --> 07:04.882
- I like it in there.
Nice people, good conversation.

07:04.882 --> 07:06.926
- So then what the fuck are we?

07:06.926 --> 07:09.011
- And they got frozen yogurt.

07:09.011 --> 07:10.805
- You said frozen yogurt
depressed the shit out of you.

07:10.805 --> 07:13.808
- Used to.
Not now.

07:16.227 --> 07:19.897
♪ I loved
you like a madman ♪

07:19.897 --> 07:22.567
