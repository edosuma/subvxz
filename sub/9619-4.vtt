03:31.419 --> 03:32.211

{\an1}&gt;&gt; NO, IN A YEAR

03:54.359 --> 03:56.486
{\an1}YOU INSUFFERABLE LITTLE TROLL.

03:56.569 --> 03:59.030
{\an1}GOTCHA.

03:59.113 --> 04:03.618
{\an1}OH, WE HAVE FUN.

{\an1}&gt;&gt; THANKS FOR TRYING ON MY

04:10.708 --> 04:11.376
{\an1}NEW SKATEWEAR DESIGNS RYAN.

04:11.459 --> 04:12.752
{\an1}IT WILL BE GOOD

04:12.835 --> 04:14.045
{\an1}TO GET SOME POSITIVE FEEDBACK

04:14.128 --> 04:14.587
{\an1}FROM A REAL SKATEBOARDER.

04:14.671 --> 04:15.797
{\an1}&gt;&gt; IS THIS SOME KIND

04:15.880 --> 04:17.589
{\an1}OF A SICK JOKE?

04:17.673 --> 04:18.341
{\an1}&gt;&gt; IS THAT SKATEBOARD LINGO

04:18.423 --> 04:20.176
{\an1}FOR "THESE SHORTS ARE AWESOME."

04:20.259 --> 04:22.595
{\an1}&gt;&gt; ARE YOU CRAZY?

04:22.679 --> 04:23.096
{\an1}WHY DO THESE SHORTS HAVE

04:23.179 --> 04:27.767
{\an1}SUCH A GIANT BUTT?

04:27.850 --> 04:28.935
{\an1}&gt;&gt; IT'S PADDING

04:29.018 --> 04:30.311
{\an1}FOR WHEN YOU FALL DOWN.

04:30.395 --> 04:34.065
{\an1}&gt;&gt; FALLING DOWN IS HALF THE FUN!

04:34.148 --> 04:34.691
{\an1}AND WHY IS THERE A SCREWDRIVER

04:34.774 --> 04:36.401
{\an1}HANGING OFF THE SIDE?

04:36.484 --> 04:37.193
{\an1}&gt;&gt; THAT WAS MY IDEA.

04:37.276 --> 04:38.820
{\an1}IT'S TO TIGHTEN YOUR WHEELS.

04:38.903 --> 04:39.570
{\an1}&gt;&gt; I LIKE IT.

04:39.654 --> 04:40.488
{\an1}IT'S FUNCTIONAL.

04:40.571 --> 04:41.322
{\an1}&gt;&gt; MAYBE IF THE FUNCTION IS

04:41.406 --> 04:42.281
{\an1}TO GET A SCREWDRIVER

04:42.365 --> 04:45.118
{\an1}STUCK IN YOUR LEG.

04:45.201 --> 04:45.827
{\an1}I WOULDN'T BE CAUGHT DEAD

04:45.910 --> 04:46.786
{\an1}IN THESE FAT BUTT SHORTS

04:46.869 --> 04:48.079

04:48.621 --> 04:52.583
{\an1}&gt;&gt; WHAT?! YOU'RE DESIGNING

04:52.667 --> 04:53.793
{\an1}SKATEBOARDING CLOTHES

04:53.876 --> 04:54.252
{\an1}AND YOU DON'T KNOW

04:54.335 --> 04:56.921
{\an1}WHAT THE QUOG IS?

04:57.005 --> 04:57.338
{\an1}WELL, THAT'S IT,

04:57.422 --> 05:03.553
{\an1}I'M DONE HERE, DONE.

05:03.636 --> 05:05.138
{\an1}THE QUOG IS A SUPER COOL

05:05.221 --> 05:05.805
{\an1}SKATE CLUB I GO TO

05:05.888 --> 05:06.347
{\an1}IN AN ABANDONED WAREHOUSE

05:06.431 --> 05:08.850
{\an1}WITH A HALF-PIPE.

05:08.933 --> 05:09.934
{\an1}&gt;&gt; WHAT'S A HALF-PIPE?

05:10.018 --> 05:14.814
{\an1}&gt;&gt; WHAT'S A HALF-PIPE?

05:15.023 --> 05:16.315
{\an1}A HALF-PIPE IS

05:16.399 --> 05:19.402
{\an1}A U-SHAPED RAMP FOR SKATING.

05:19.485 --> 05:21.320
{\an1}WHO DOESN'T KNOW THAT?

05:21.404 --> 05:21.988
{\an1}&gt;&gt; OKAY, WELL CAN

05:22.071 --> 05:22.822
{\an1}LULU AND I COME WITH YOU

05:22.905 --> 05:23.322
{\an1}TO CHECK OUT THE QUORG?

05:23.406 --> 05:24.323
{\an1}&gt;&gt; I DON'T THINK SO.

05:24.407 --> 05:26.284
{\an1}THEY HAVE A RULE ABOUT GIRLS.

05:26.367 --> 05:26.743
{\an1}&gt;&gt; WHAT'S THE RULE?

05:26.826 --> 05:28.161
{\an1}&gt;&gt; THEY'RE NOT ALLOWED.

05:28.244 --> 05:29.954
{\an1}IT'D BE TOO DISTRACTING.

05:30.038 --> 05:31.205
{\an1}&gt;&gt; THAT DOESN'T SEEM FAIR.

05:31.289 --> 05:31.998
{\an1}&gt;&gt; YEAH! THE QUIG SOUNDS LAME.

05:32.081 --> 05:37.879
{\an1}&gt;&gt; QUOG! QUOG!

05:37.962 --> 05:40.381
{\an1}ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT, THAT'S IT.

05:40.465 --> 05:41.591
{\an1}THAT'S IT.

05:41.674 --> 05:42.717
{\an1}I AM GOING TO LEAVE

05:42.800 --> 05:43.801
{\an1}FOR REAL THIS TIME

05:43.885 --> 05:48.139
{\an1}WHILE I STILL HAVE MY DIGNITY.

05:48.222 --> 05:48.514
{\an1}&gt;&gt; THAT STINKS.

05:48.598 --> 05:49.724
{\an1}I WISH WE COULD GO

05:49.807 --> 05:50.892
{\an1}TO THE QUORG.

05:50.975 --> 05:54.312

21:24.408 --> 21:26.952
{\an1}TO SEND ME A NEW ASSISTANT.

21:46.304 --> 21:47.305
{\an1}FORWARD TO RYAN'S FUNERAL

21:47.389 --> 21:48.849
{\an1}SO I COULD HANG OUT

21:48.932 --> 21:50.100
{\an1}WITH MIKEY J.

21:50.183 --> 21:50.642

{\an1}&gt;&gt; I TOLD YOU IT WAS GOING

21:51.309 --> 21:56.148
{\an1}TO MAKE ME SOUND BAD.

21:56.148 --> 21:59.234
