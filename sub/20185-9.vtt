00:00.476 --> 00:03.045
Previously on AMC's "The Son"...

00:03.047 --> 00:04.713
Eli: You rode through an oil seep.

00:04.715 --> 00:06.750
Man: It's on Pedro García's land.

00:06.753 --> 00:07.916
What do we do about Pete?

00:07.918 --> 00:09.101
Keep him in the dark.

00:09.104 --> 00:11.653
Maria García was still
a member of that family.

00:11.655 --> 00:13.188
What happened with Sally?

00:13.190 --> 00:14.856
Man #2: She's gonna stay in the city.

00:14.858 --> 00:16.625
Your Honor, there are a few records

00:16.627 --> 00:18.060
we would like to have altered.

00:18.062 --> 00:19.895
Woman: You and your men killed everyone,

00:19.897 --> 00:20.996
except my father.

00:20.998 --> 00:22.631
That was a long time ago.

00:23.552 --> 00:25.801
- Who did this?!
- I didn't see the fella.

00:25.803 --> 00:27.936
Damn, look at 'em all.

00:27.938 --> 00:29.605
Uh.

04:20.028 --> 04:22.295
Tiehteti.

04:22.330 --> 04:24.830
Eli. My name's Eli.

04:28.670 --> 04:31.604
You speak English?

04:32.707 --> 04:36.242
I'm Maggie Phelps.

04:36.277 --> 04:38.678
Stand up.

04:47.956 --> 04:49.021
How's it feel?

04:49.057 --> 04:50.489
Better.

04:50.525 --> 04:51.991
Swelling went down.

04:52.026 --> 04:54.594
We need to keep rubbing
that coneflower on you,

04:54.629 --> 04:56.796
mornings and night.

05:04.572 --> 05:07.240
Those savages know about coneflower?

05:10.511 --> 05:11.811
They call it tuka natsu.

05:11.846 --> 05:15.781
Well, look at you,
speaking their tongue.

05:15.817 --> 05:19.018
Well, you can forget
all that nonsense now.

05:19.053 --> 05:20.820
You made it out.

05:20.855 --> 05:23.723
Those Lamanites won't
lay another finger on you.

05:23.758 --> 05:27.226
They're Comanches.

05:27.270 --> 05:29.570
We call 'em Lamanites.

05:29.597 --> 05:31.030
Who's we?

05:31.065 --> 05:33.399
Settlers.

05:33.434 --> 05:36.035
Where's the rest of you?

05:36.070 --> 05:40.539
I had to go out on my own for a bit.

05:40.575 --> 05:42.375
But I will catch up with my people

05:42.410 --> 05:44.777
when providence deems it so.

05:48.516 --> 05:54.920
You ain't ever seen a wagon
train long as this, Eli...

05:54.956 --> 06:00.660
hundreds of us, fulfilling
a divine prophecy.

06:00.695 --> 06:01.994
Then why'd you leave?

06:02.030 --> 06:04.830
We parted ways in the
Indian territories.

06:04.866 --> 06:06.732
There was a disagreement with the elders

06:06.768 --> 06:11.203
necessitated me moving on.

06:11.239 --> 06:15.041
God knows my specialness...

06:15.076 --> 06:18.377
even if some of His
lesser creatures do not.

06:21.416 --> 06:24.116
So, it's just you out here all alone?

06:24.152 --> 06:25.584
It's just me.

06:25.620 --> 06:27.953
No family? No husband?

06:34.162 --> 06:37.096
My man, Liam, died.

06:37.131 --> 06:38.531
Felled not by savages,

06:38.566 --> 06:43.736
but a pain in his gut
from the bad water.

06:43.771 --> 06:45.971
I'm real sorry about that.

06:53.581 --> 06:55.548
You've lost family, too.

06:55.583 --> 06:59.251
I can tell.

06:59.287 --> 07:02.421
Any of 'em left?

07:02.457 --> 07:05.958
Just my daddy.

07:05.993 --> 07:08.661
Well...

07:08.696 --> 07:11.497
I can help you find him.

07:14.635 --> 07:19.472
Ft. Bent is just a few days ride.

07:19.507 --> 07:23.876
They're real good at reuniting
captives with their kin.

07:26.381 --> 07:28.447
I don't ever wanna see him again.

07:28.483 --> 07:30.249
Don't talk like that.

07:30.284 --> 07:31.417
Why not?

07:31.452 --> 07:32.585
He's your father.

07:32.620 --> 07:36.255
He got drunk, hit us all the time,

07:36.290 --> 07:38.257
made my Momma cry on
the account'a that whore

07:38.292 --> 07:41.093
he kept in San Antonio.

07:41.129 --> 07:43.028
I ain't got no loyalty for that man.

07:43.064 --> 07:46.599
And I sure the hell
ain't gonna live with him.

07:46.634 --> 07:48.467
Maggie, I appreciate your kindness,

07:48.503 --> 07:50.369
but I got to be somewhere.

07:50.405 --> 07:54.306
I'll be happy to do chores or hunt

07:54.342 --> 07:56.108
if you'd let me borrow a few things.

07:56.144 --> 08:00.312
What you need is rest.

08:00.348 --> 08:01.680
You don't understand.

08:01.716 --> 08:03.236
My people are gonna be looking for me.

08:03.251 --> 08:04.350
I need to get back to 'em.

08:04.385 --> 08:07.019
What people? The Lamanites?

08:17.432 --> 08:20.166
Those ain't people.

09:12.429 --> 09:13.862
What?

09:13.897 --> 09:17.432
Hmm?

09:17.467 --> 09:19.367
What's going on in there?

09:19.410 --> 09:23.478
Just feeling... I dunno... happy?

09:28.111 --> 09:30.245
Well, you say that like a question.

09:30.280 --> 09:31.613
It's probably 'cause it's been a while

09:31.615 --> 09:33.748
since I felt that way.

09:33.784 --> 09:36.551
When I'm around you, it's
like nothing else matters.

09:36.587 --> 09:39.387
I don't feel ashamed.
I don't feel guilty.

09:39.423 --> 09:41.756
What do you have to be ashamed of?

09:41.792 --> 09:43.491
How much time you got?

09:46.430 --> 09:47.495
Us?

09:47.531 --> 09:49.335
No, not us.

10:13.390 --> 10:14.689
I've hurt a lot of people.

10:14.725 --> 10:18.293
You know that, right?

10:18.328 --> 10:20.662
You mean Sally?

10:20.697 --> 10:23.965
No. No.

10:24.001 --> 10:28.603
Well, yeah, but not just her.

10:28.639 --> 10:31.206
I've hurt a lot of people, Maria.

10:33.510 --> 10:36.511
Pete?

10:36.546 --> 10:38.380
My father gets home from Austin soon.

10:38.415 --> 10:40.682
We should probably go.

10:40.716 --> 10:44.018
Yeah, I should go, too.

10:44.054 --> 10:47.889
My family will be wondering where I am.

11:39.376 --> 11:41.609
Everything all right?

11:44.815 --> 11:46.915
I know who shot me.

11:50.954 --> 11:53.555
The daughter of that Apache kid.

11:55.592 --> 11:57.092
What Apache kid?

11:57.127 --> 12:00.628
The one I left on the riverbank.

12:00.664 --> 12:02.063
He was real?

12:02.099 --> 12:04.132
'Course he was.

12:04.167 --> 12:06.701
I always thought you invented
that part of the story.

12:06.737 --> 12:09.471
No. He was flesh, all right,

12:09.506 --> 12:11.139
and he grew up telling his daughter

12:11.174 --> 12:14.976
all about how I killed their people.

12:15.011 --> 12:18.580
She let me know right before
she pulled the trigger.

12:18.615 --> 12:20.115
Should we go after her?

12:20.150 --> 12:22.951
No. I'm grateful...

12:22.986 --> 12:27.288
grateful for her
showing up when she did.

12:27.324 --> 12:29.248
It was a sign.

12:30.761 --> 12:32.427
I'm being warned.

12:32.462 --> 12:34.462
What do you mean, it was a sign?

12:34.498 --> 12:35.997
Like magic?

12:36.032 --> 12:37.832
Well, call it what you want.

12:37.868 --> 12:40.602
I can't ignore it.

12:40.637 --> 12:44.239
I'm calling this off.

12:44.274 --> 12:46.508
Oh, no.

12:46.543 --> 12:48.243
You're not getting cold feet now.

12:48.278 --> 12:50.845
We just bribed a judge with
every last dollar we have.

12:50.881 --> 12:52.013
So get it back.

12:52.048 --> 12:53.168
Bribes don't work like that.

12:53.183 --> 12:54.916
I don't care!

12:54.951 --> 12:57.318
I've got principles.

12:57.354 --> 13:00.421
I never hurt anyone that
didn't come at me first.

13:00.457 --> 13:02.023
Pedro García... He's our friend.

13:02.058 --> 13:03.424
He saved our lives.

13:03.460 --> 13:06.027
If I attacked him,
what does that make me?

13:06.062 --> 13:07.529
This isn't easy, Daddy.

13:07.564 --> 13:09.297
No one's saying it is.

13:09.332 --> 13:11.866
You don't have children.

13:11.902 --> 13:16.871
You don't have to consider
what you're teaching them.

13:16.914 --> 13:19.347
Oh, you taught me and Pete
plenty back in the day,

13:19.376 --> 13:21.442
lessons I am not proud to have learned.

13:21.478 --> 13:24.612
I taught you to protect what's yours.

13:24.648 --> 13:26.867
This will be something different.

13:26.898 --> 13:28.394
Don't you understand?

13:28.405 --> 13:29.838
No. I don't understand at all.

13:29.858 --> 13:31.404
You sure this ain't
a man getting spooked

13:31.406 --> 13:32.453
'cause he just got shot?

13:32.489 --> 13:38.660
I've been shot or cut more
times than I can count.

13:38.695 --> 13:42.630
I'm spooked about something
that's a lot bigger.

13:42.666 --> 13:44.499
We're calling this off.

13:44.534 --> 13:46.801
You know we'll lose the ranch.

13:46.837 --> 13:48.505
Then we lose it.

No.

14:56.938 --> 14:59.005
What's that?

14:59.040 --> 15:02.242
It's an instrument of revelation.

15:02.277 --> 15:04.177
Looks like rocks in a hat to me.

15:04.212 --> 15:07.380
I use it to divine prophecy.

15:07.415 --> 15:09.349
I don't believe that.

15:11.686 --> 15:16.556
Would you like to know your future?

15:16.591 --> 15:18.324
All right.

15:26.768 --> 15:31.171
Heavenly Lord, I humbly pray
for your wisdom and discernment.

15:31.206 --> 15:35.175
Illuminate me so that I can
testify to this young man

15:35.210 --> 15:38.811
his direction if it be your will.

15:57.499 --> 16:00.066
Well?

16:00.101 --> 16:02.602
You're gonna be a great warrior.

16:02.637 --> 16:05.438
Folks everywhere will know your name.

16:05.473 --> 16:08.041
Yeah?

16:08.076 --> 16:11.411
You will live a long life, Eli,

16:11.446 --> 16:16.249
and you will prosper beyond your dreams.

16:16.284 --> 16:18.284
What about Prairie Flower?

16:18.320 --> 16:19.842
- Who?
- My girl.

16:19.874 --> 16:21.321
We gonna get married?

16:21.356 --> 16:22.822
You will.

16:22.857 --> 16:25.758
And when you're a little older,

16:25.794 --> 16:29.429
you're gonna have three sons,

16:29.464 --> 16:33.933
strong and handsome.

16:33.969 --> 16:38.938
And the youngest will be your favorite.

16:59.494 --> 17:01.628
Hiya.

17:01.663 --> 17:03.696
Pete: How's it going, big brother?

17:03.732 --> 17:05.198
You all right?

17:05.233 --> 17:06.665
How's Daddy?

17:06.701 --> 17:08.835
Spent two weeks arguing
with the doctors,

17:08.869 --> 17:11.271
thinking he knows more than they do.

17:11.306 --> 17:13.873
Took everything in my power
to keep him from driving.

17:13.907 --> 17:16.342
Guess that's a victory.

17:16.377 --> 17:18.278
How'd his stitches take the trip?

17:18.313 --> 17:21.848
Fine... though we
can't get him worked up.

17:21.883 --> 17:24.117
Otherwise, his lung
might collapse again.

17:24.152 --> 17:26.352
Oh, man.

17:32.427 --> 17:34.093
Sorry about the state of things.

17:34.095 --> 17:35.461
Since the vaqueros quit,

17:35.497 --> 17:37.397
I've been doing the repairs by myself.

17:37.432 --> 17:39.132
Oh, I can see that.

17:39.167 --> 17:40.700
It's looking good.

17:42.337 --> 17:44.137
How you been otherwise?

17:44.172 --> 17:45.538
I'm fine.

17:45.573 --> 17:47.407
You don't pick up the phone when I call.

17:47.442 --> 17:48.508
Been worried.

17:48.543 --> 17:49.876
I got a lot on my plate.

17:49.911 --> 17:52.211
Mm, makes sense, you and Sally havin'

17:52.247 --> 17:54.547
this rough patch, after
all you been through.

17:54.582 --> 17:56.516
It's more than a rough patch.

17:56.551 --> 18:00.086
That true?

18:00.136 --> 18:02.103
I don't think we can
talk about this, Finn.

18:02.123 --> 18:04.724
I know you and Sally are close.

18:04.759 --> 18:07.026
You're my brother first.

18:10.535 --> 18:12.101
I hope you don't give up, is all.

18:12.136 --> 18:13.836
That's not your decision, Finn.

18:13.871 --> 18:16.038
What are you saying? Divorce?

18:16.074 --> 18:17.340
Eli: Is that Pete I hear?

18:17.375 --> 18:18.641
You're supposed to be resting.

18:18.676 --> 18:19.842
Bullshit.

18:19.877 --> 18:22.178
Let's get drunk.

18:24.582 --> 18:28.184
It was just before
I bought this ranch...

18:28.219 --> 18:30.386
the last days of the Civil War.

18:32.423 --> 18:35.725
I spent weeks trying to get
back to your mother in Austin.

18:35.760 --> 18:38.728
One night, I was camped
out by this stream,

18:38.763 --> 18:40.896
just sitting there, thinking.

18:40.932 --> 18:46.202
It was real quiet... hardly any wind.

18:46.237 --> 18:51.040
Then... out of nowhere...

18:51.876 --> 18:53.676
Aaaaah!

18:55.713 --> 18:57.980
It was a mountain lion.

18:58.016 --> 19:01.651
The bastard snuck up
about 10 feet behind me.

19:01.686 --> 19:05.921
And in that moment, I knew...

19:05.957 --> 19:08.424
"So, this is how I die.

19:08.459 --> 19:12.728
After the Comanches, the Tonks,
the Rangers, the Union Army,

19:12.764 --> 19:14.397
the thugs, the bandits,

19:14.432 --> 19:17.433
a goddamn lion will be my end!"

19:19.804 --> 19:22.171
How'd you get away?

19:22.206 --> 19:25.107
I didn't.

19:26.210 --> 19:28.878
The lion spared me.

19:31.816 --> 19:34.483
He just looked at me and walked off.

19:37.722 --> 19:39.822
It was a sign.

19:41.626 --> 19:44.794
It took everything I
had to buy this property.

19:44.829 --> 19:46.395
A lot of folks thought I was crazy,

19:46.431 --> 19:49.298
including your mother,
but I saw something in it

19:49.333 --> 19:54.704
that I loved, that I
wanted to build on...

19:54.739 --> 19:58.307
I was gonna give to you boys one day.

19:58.342 --> 20:00.976
I'm sorry that's not gonna happen now.

20:05.183 --> 20:09.485
What're you sayin', Daddy?

20:09.520 --> 20:10.920
Well, didn't your brother tell you?

20:10.955 --> 20:13.889
We're gonna sell this ol' place...

20:13.925 --> 20:16.325
just as soon as you fix it back up.

20:16.360 --> 20:18.027
Oh.

20:19.697 --> 20:21.931
We've lived a good life here.

20:21.966 --> 20:25.735
Yeah. Yeah, I guess we have.

20:27.371 --> 20:31.006
Yeah, I think it's better this way.

20:31.042 --> 20:34.443
You'll go back up to
Austin with the family,

20:34.479 --> 20:36.946
finally give Sally what she wants.

20:36.981 --> 20:38.647
That does make a lot of sense.

20:38.683 --> 20:40.716
Top you off?

20:44.155 --> 20:47.022
This could be good for all of
us, new beginnings and all that.

20:47.058 --> 20:50.793
I think I'm gonna get a
small patch up in North Texas,

20:50.828 --> 20:52.962
maybe about 20 head,

20:52.997 --> 20:55.030
somewhere where there's
a little bit more water.

20:55.066 --> 20:56.832
Probably gonna need a few hundred acres.

20:56.868 --> 20:59.869
No, probably not.

20:59.904 --> 21:02.605
Living wild, just
like the good old days.

21:08.481 --> 21:09.979
_

21:11.415 --> 21:13.816
_

21:15.762 --> 21:17.485
_

21:18.807 --> 21:21.113
_

21:25.576 --> 21:27.828
_

21:29.560 --> 21:31.040
_

21:37.421 --> 21:42.468
_

21:43.469 --> 21:45.862
_

21:46.752 --> 21:54.521
_

21:56.649 --> 22:00.444
_

22:03.197 --> 22:04.949
_

22:07.034 --> 22:10.630
_

22:10.660 --> 22:12.393
Mm.

22:14.416 --> 22:15.724
_

22:18.629 --> 22:21.131
_

22:22.800 --> 22:30.349
_

22:49.487 --> 22:51.487
Pedro!

23:03.361 --> 23:05.995
Maggie: I think you're ready.

23:06.030 --> 23:08.964
For what?

23:09.000 --> 23:12.601
You and me is gonna
ride into town tomorrow.

23:12.637 --> 23:14.837
It's time for you to return

23:14.872 --> 23:17.439
to civilization, to your people.

23:17.475 --> 23:20.009
I told you, I don't want that.

23:20.044 --> 23:22.177
Come on. I promise.
Just loan me your horse.

23:22.213 --> 23:23.712
I'll be back in a month
with three for you.

23:23.714 --> 23:25.681
You leave, I'll never see you again.

23:25.716 --> 23:27.850
I don't forget friends.

23:27.885 --> 23:29.184
You gotta trust me.

23:29.220 --> 23:31.020
My tribe needs me. I need to go back.

23:31.055 --> 23:32.655
Your tribe.

23:34.792 --> 23:37.426
Those Lamanites did a
number on you, didn't they?

23:37.461 --> 23:39.528
Heck, I thought you
said it was one of them

23:39.563 --> 23:42.631
that pushed you off the cliff.

23:42.667 --> 23:44.366
_

23:44.402 --> 23:47.369
but he's the only one.

23:47.405 --> 23:50.272
I've got a father and brothers and...

23:50.308 --> 23:52.408
And that girl you said I'm gonna marry.

23:55.179 --> 23:57.880
So I did.

24:07.058 --> 24:09.825
Sweet Lord above.

24:12.663 --> 24:18.367
I suppose first love is a
mighty powerful inducement.

24:18.402 --> 24:20.536
Is that really what you want?

24:20.571 --> 24:22.705
Yes.

24:22.740 --> 24:25.574
But I need to borrow
your horse... please.

24:25.609 --> 24:27.910
You can really catch me more horses?

24:27.945 --> 24:29.311
They taught you those ways?

24:29.347 --> 24:30.746
I'll leave out first thing tomorrow.

24:30.748 --> 24:32.715
I'll come back with some. I promise.

25:21.332 --> 25:23.065
Shh.

25:23.100 --> 25:24.566
Shh.

25:24.602 --> 25:26.869
Shh.

25:54.348 --> 25:57.983
I've been working the
Schultz Ranch for 12 years.

25:58.019 --> 25:59.285
I worked Christmas.

25:59.320 --> 26:01.620
I worked the day my Fredrick was born.

26:01.656 --> 26:04.623
And what's any of that
sacrifice mean, I ask you,

26:04.659 --> 26:06.925
any of that loyalty?

26:06.961 --> 26:10.663
Nothing, 'cause a Mexican
will work for half your wage.

26:10.698 --> 26:14.133
- Mm.
- Check.

26:14.168 --> 26:15.968
Screw it. I raise a quarter.

26:16.003 --> 26:19.805
Schultz is a parsimonious fool.

26:19.840 --> 26:23.275
Skimping on quality labor will just

26:23.311 --> 26:26.645
drive his fallow ranch
that much faster into dust.

26:26.681 --> 26:28.547
You're better off looking for work

26:28.582 --> 26:30.149
ahead of your sorry comrades.

26:30.184 --> 26:31.372
There ain't no work.

26:31.395 --> 26:34.385
All these fat bastard
ranch owners are scooping up

26:34.388 --> 26:35.921
the Mexicans that just
keep coming and coming.

26:35.923 --> 26:37.122
Yeah, but all those Mexers

26:37.158 --> 26:38.991
will turn on their bosses soon enough.

26:39.026 --> 26:40.292
And then I'll get called in

26:40.328 --> 26:41.894
to settle all manner of disagreements.

26:41.929 --> 26:43.796
And the ranchers will
realize who they hired,

26:43.831 --> 26:45.698
and they'll come running
to you. Mark my words.

26:45.733 --> 26:50.669
Listen to the Sheriff,
Louis. And I definitely fold.

26:50.705 --> 26:52.204
Yes. Too rich for me.

26:52.239 --> 26:54.673
- I fold.
- Me too.

26:54.709 --> 26:57.910
Well, there you go, Louis.

26:57.945 --> 26:59.411
Your luck is changing.

27:06.520 --> 27:09.221
You don't have to be
gentle with me, Niles.

27:09.256 --> 27:13.759
I can see the truth just
as plain as any of us.

27:13.794 --> 27:17.596
This place don't belong to us no more.

27:17.631 --> 27:20.399
We are being replaced.

27:20.434 --> 27:22.768
Now, you listen to me, my friend.

27:22.803 --> 27:26.705
There's no use in
accepting defeat like this.

27:26.741 --> 27:28.874
That ain't what any of us are made of.

27:28.909 --> 27:32.678
But tell me... is my son
gonna have a Mexican boss?

27:32.713 --> 27:35.247
Will his children be
chided and beaten down

27:35.282 --> 27:36.615
because of the color of their skin?

27:36.617 --> 27:37.716
That ain't gonna happen.

27:37.752 --> 27:39.318
It already is.

27:46.494 --> 27:51.063
We'll get you through this, Louis.

27:51.098 --> 27:53.365
You got friends around this table.

27:53.401 --> 27:55.300
- Mm-hmm.
- That's right.

27:55.336 --> 27:57.136
And what'd you do today?

27:57.171 --> 28:00.472
Jeannie: I went riding at the
Beasley's place in Bastrop,

28:00.508 --> 28:02.641
but their horses aren't very good.

28:02.676 --> 28:04.209
That so?

28:04.245 --> 28:07.079
They all have hard mouths.

28:07.114 --> 28:09.248
I told Mr. Beasley
he was being too rough

28:09.283 --> 28:12.418
with the reins, but he said
I was being impertinent.

28:12.453 --> 28:16.555
Good girl.

28:16.590 --> 28:19.458
I want to go back and see Chestnut...

28:19.493 --> 28:21.126
see everybody.

28:21.162 --> 28:23.562
You're not having fun in the city?

28:23.597 --> 28:25.662
Would you be having fun?

28:27.968 --> 28:29.601
Your things'll make you feel better.

28:29.637 --> 28:32.171
Inez and I will start
packing up your room today.

28:32.206 --> 28:34.606
You mean you'll watch Inez pack my room?

28:34.642 --> 28:36.942
No. I'm gonna help her.

28:36.977 --> 28:38.477
Crating up that dollhouse

28:38.512 --> 28:40.112
is gonna take more
than one set of hands.

28:40.147 --> 28:42.114
Wh... You're crating up the dollhouse?

28:42.149 --> 28:44.950
How else am I gonna
get it to you in Austin?

28:44.985 --> 28:47.319
You should leave it
alone. I don't need it.

28:47.354 --> 28:48.852
You love that dollhouse.

28:50.491 --> 28:52.691
I'm too old for dolls.

28:52.726 --> 28:54.259
I'll fix up the bullet holes.

28:54.295 --> 28:55.828
No. That's all right.

28:55.863 --> 28:57.930
Just send my books, please.

28:57.965 --> 28:59.498
I definitely want those.

28:59.533 --> 29:00.999
You got it.

29:01.035 --> 29:03.001
Will you bring them yourself?

29:03.037 --> 29:05.871
For you, anything.

29:05.906 --> 29:07.439
Promise?

29:07.475 --> 29:09.508
I promise.

29:09.543 --> 29:12.811
I miss you.

29:12.847 --> 29:14.980
I miss you, too.

29:15.015 --> 29:17.382
Okay, well, it's been
good talking to you, honey.

29:17.418 --> 29:18.517
I love you, Dad.

29:18.552 --> 29:19.885
I love you.

29:22.512 --> 29:24.323
Hey, Daddy, where you going?

29:24.358 --> 29:27.659
Takin' Poco Bueno out,
stretch his legs and mine.

29:27.695 --> 29:31.129
You can't ride with stitches.

29:31.165 --> 29:33.332
Watch me.

29:33.367 --> 29:37.202
When Phineas gets back,
he's gonna pitch a fit.

29:37.238 --> 29:41.373
I'm sincerely touched by your concern.

29:42.776 --> 29:45.844
Hey, uh, you want some company?

29:45.880 --> 29:49.515
I do not.

29:49.550 --> 29:51.717
Another time.

29:51.752 --> 29:55.420
All right, son?

31:41.862 --> 31:43.028
Come on.

32:51.924 --> 32:54.191
You taking me to Fort Bent?

32:54.226 --> 32:57.928
There's a reward for white captives.

32:57.963 --> 33:00.230
A big one.

33:00.266 --> 33:04.968
I'm gonna take my sum and
set a course west to Zion.

33:05.004 --> 33:07.070
When I return as a prosperous woman,

33:07.106 --> 33:09.907
those elders will reconsider

33:09.942 --> 33:13.110
their harsh words and
baseless accusations.

33:13.145 --> 33:16.380
It was bad water killed my Liam.

33:16.415 --> 33:19.816
Bad water, plain and simple!

33:19.852 --> 33:22.319
I loved him.

33:37.603 --> 33:39.102
Attaboy.

33:39.138 --> 33:42.239
You feel good about this?

33:42.274 --> 33:43.674
About what?

33:43.709 --> 33:47.110
Betraying me.

33:47.146 --> 33:50.681
I'm surviving, no
different from anybody else.

33:50.716 --> 33:53.417
Why do you pretend to be different then?

33:53.452 --> 33:54.952
You say you're a godly person,

33:54.987 --> 33:57.921
but you're not a godly person.

33:57.957 --> 34:01.692
What you're doin' to me
is wrong, and you know it.

34:01.727 --> 34:05.963
Your Daddy's gonna be so
excited to see you alive.

34:05.998 --> 34:09.166
You're both gonna thank me for this.

34:09.201 --> 34:11.201
Wait and see.

34:17.176 --> 34:19.275
Here you go.

34:30.590 --> 34:32.054
How much longer?

34:32.091 --> 34:35.859
Two days at this pace, maybe three.

34:35.893 --> 34:38.462
This sun's killing me.

34:50.876 --> 34:52.009
All right.

34:52.043 --> 34:54.444
Ugh!

35:09.294 --> 35:11.428
What do you think you're doing?

35:11.470 --> 35:16.073
I won't last more than a
couple of days without a horse.

35:17.636 --> 35:20.704
The rifle, then, just... Just the rifle.

35:20.739 --> 35:21.938
I'm gonna need it.

35:21.974 --> 35:23.674
You don't know what you're doing.

35:23.709 --> 35:25.709
You leave me here like this,

35:25.744 --> 35:28.745
you may as well put one of
those bullets in my head.

35:28.781 --> 35:30.914
You brought this on yourself.

35:30.949 --> 35:33.550
Eli, stop!

35:33.585 --> 35:35.218
Don't you go!

35:35.254 --> 35:37.187
Don't leave me here!

35:37.222 --> 35:39.089
I'll die out here!

35:39.124 --> 35:40.691
Wait. Wait.

35:40.726 --> 35:43.427
Just wait, Eli!

35:43.462 --> 35:46.296
What?

35:46.331 --> 35:49.232
I didn't tell you the entire prophecy.

35:49.268 --> 35:50.600
I don't care.

35:50.636 --> 35:52.035
You should.

35:52.071 --> 35:54.571
Your... Your oldest son...

35:54.606 --> 35:58.041
He's gonna die when he's still a child.

35:58.077 --> 36:01.912
Your middle son will betray you.

36:01.947 --> 36:07.084
And your youngest, your favorite...

36:07.119 --> 36:09.986
You're gonna do something so terrible,

36:10.022 --> 36:11.922
you'll lose him forever.

36:11.957 --> 36:13.457
Good luck, Maggie.

36:14.526 --> 36:15.959
Eli!

36:15.994 --> 36:20.464
That act of treachery
will poison your bloodline!

36:20.499 --> 36:25.402
I curse you, Eli McCullough!

36:25.437 --> 36:28.805
My God curses you!

36:28.841 --> 36:34.144
May your immortal soul roast in hell!

36:36.381 --> 36:38.615
Damn you!

36:41.120 --> 36:43.118
Damn you!

37:12.030 --> 37:14.764
Daddy?

37:14.800 --> 37:16.166
What's the matter with you?

37:16.201 --> 37:17.534
You could kill yourself!

37:20.505 --> 37:22.972
You burned down the saloon.

37:27.913 --> 37:29.279
I did.

37:29.314 --> 37:30.714
After I said not to.

37:30.749 --> 37:33.450
I know what you said.

37:33.485 --> 37:36.953
But I know what you wanted...
what you really wanted.

37:36.988 --> 37:39.489
That's not what I wanted.

37:39.524 --> 37:42.358
Christ, son.

37:42.394 --> 37:43.993
Someone could have died in that fire.

37:44.029 --> 37:47.497
We made sure the place was empty.

37:47.532 --> 37:50.567
I paid off Niles Gilbert's
little buddy... Louis.

37:50.602 --> 37:52.836
He'll make a very credible witness.

37:52.871 --> 37:56.539
You do not know what's in my heart.

37:58.844 --> 38:01.177
I think I do.

38:03.782 --> 38:06.983
You told me about your
Comanche superstitions

38:07.018 --> 38:09.753
and how this'd be the
worst thing you ever done,

38:09.788 --> 38:16.226
but there's another
part to it, isn't there?

38:16.261 --> 38:19.395
You're afraid of losing Pete.

38:19.431 --> 38:22.599
You can talk to me about
anything, but not about that.

38:22.634 --> 38:24.601
It doesn't matter.

38:24.636 --> 38:26.035
I know it, anyway.

38:26.071 --> 38:27.036
How could I not?

38:29.808 --> 38:32.575
You didn't want the guilt of this thing,

38:32.611 --> 38:36.679
so I took the burden on myself.

38:36.715 --> 38:40.950
And I did it because I love you.

38:40.986 --> 38:44.687
You did wrong.

38:44.723 --> 38:46.289
You did wrong.

38:46.324 --> 38:50.627
I wasn't gonna let you
walk away from this, Daddy.

38:50.662 --> 38:53.229
That's not how you taught me.

38:56.635 --> 39:00.236
So, what you gonna do now?

39:00.272 --> 39:05.041
You gonna call the police?

39:05.076 --> 39:08.278
Invite Niles Gilbert
over to burn the ranch?

39:17.155 --> 39:18.888
Okay, c'mon, now.

39:18.924 --> 39:21.558
Let's get you inside.

39:21.593 --> 39:24.894
You shouldn't have been riding.

39:41.346 --> 39:44.247
What is this?

39:44.282 --> 39:46.162
Jeannie didn't want me
to pack up her dollhouse.

39:46.184 --> 39:47.984
She was real insistent.

39:48.019 --> 39:49.819
Guess I know why.

39:49.855 --> 39:53.122
Let's all have a drink,
talk about this calmly.

39:53.158 --> 39:55.658
No. He's gonna tell me
right now what's going on.

39:58.230 --> 40:01.798
Where's this from?

40:05.337 --> 40:07.337
The Garcías have oil on their land,

40:07.372 --> 40:11.507
and they don't know about it.

40:11.543 --> 40:14.043
What are you gonna do to them?

40:18.416 --> 40:21.851
I met Judge Kilborne a few weeks ago.

40:21.887 --> 40:24.520
He's gonna change the
Garcías' tax records

40:24.556 --> 40:26.689
down at the courthouse.

40:26.725 --> 40:28.324
How much that cost us?

40:28.360 --> 40:31.961
Everything.

40:31.997 --> 40:33.930
Now what happens?

40:36.434 --> 40:38.735
Pedro García ain't
gonna go without a fight.

40:38.770 --> 40:41.070
What happens next?

40:45.844 --> 40:48.778
I swear to God, one
of you better answer.

40:55.220 --> 41:01.324
Niles Gilbert's bar just burned down.

41:01.359 --> 41:04.427
He believes Pedro sent men to do it.

41:08.133 --> 41:11.534
That's where both of
you just were... in town?

41:11.569 --> 41:13.870
Pete, buddy, come on.

41:13.905 --> 41:15.438
Let's have a drink and talk it over.

41:15.473 --> 41:17.106
There ain't nothing
you can do right now.

41:17.142 --> 41:18.708
You can't leave.

41:20.278 --> 41:22.211
Try and stop me.

41:25.884 --> 41:27.750
Pete?

41:27.786 --> 41:29.419
Pete, don't do this.

41:29.454 --> 41:30.753
Pete, don't do this!

41:30.789 --> 41:32.288
Please, Pete!

41:32.324 --> 41:35.058
Pete, don't do this! Come back!

41:43.501 --> 41:46.202
You're the devil. You know that?

41:46.237 --> 41:48.471
You're gonna get yourself
killed in this state.

41:48.506 --> 41:51.641
Come back inside right now... Right now.

41:51.676 --> 41:54.477
You care about me now?

41:54.512 --> 41:55.745
Please, son.

41:55.780 --> 41:57.413
Please, let's talk.

42:02.988 --> 42:04.454
I love that horse.

42:06.157 --> 42:07.323
But I'll do it.

42:07.359 --> 42:08.558
We got a hundred more horses.

42:08.593 --> 42:09.993
You gonna kill them all?

42:11.863 --> 42:14.831
You want to stop me, Daddy, shoot me.

42:16.001 --> 42:17.577
Hyah!

42:29.014 --> 42:30.513
What now?

42:30.548 --> 42:32.615
You get control of the
situation is what now.

42:32.650 --> 42:34.817
Tell Neptune to bring 'round the car.

42:34.853 --> 42:36.319
All right.

42:36.354 --> 42:38.454
And get you a rifle!
