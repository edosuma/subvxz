Good afternoon, everyone.

00:34.202 --> 00:35.495
Miss Esmie!

00:35.578 --> 00:37.080
What happened to your hand?

00:37.163 --> 00:39.332
-Oh, no!
-Are you OK?

00:39.748 --> 00:41.333
It's OK, everyone.

00:41.417 --> 00:43.837
I twisted my wrist
playing hockey yesterday.

00:43.962 --> 00:47.923
The doctor says it's just a minor sprain,
and it will be good as new in no time.

00:48.007 --> 00:52.387
As long as you follow the doctor's orders
and rest it for a few days.

00:52.553 --> 00:57.058
That means Esmie is not supposed to use
her left hand or wrist for anything.

00:57.142 --> 00:59.977
Does that mean no pizza making?

01:00.060 --> 01:01.772
Or piano lessons?

01:01.855 --> 01:04.023
Or bowling, or basketball.

01:04.107 --> 01:07.027
I know it's not going to be easy
to wait for it to heal,

01:07.110 --> 01:10.572
but I'm going to do my best
to be a patient patient.

01:10.697 --> 01:13.032

we can to help you.

until your witchy-ups go away.

the only way to get rid of hiccups

Oh, I really love puppets,

11:44.372 --> 11:46.457
magic tricks and juggling--
[gasps]

11:46.623 --> 11:48.792
Wait. What? We are?

11:49.168 --> 11:51.837
Sure. It's a parent-child
talent show.

11:51.920 --> 11:53.588
We're performing together!

11:53.755 --> 11:56.925
Oh... I guess I forgot to tell you.

11:57.050 --> 11:58.093
Sorry.

11:58.177 --> 12:00.637
[gasps nervously]

12:00.720 --> 12:02.013
It's OK, Mr. Mash.

12:02.138 --> 12:04.808
You don't have to perform tonight
if you're not comfortable.

12:04.892 --> 12:06.685
But my dad loves juggling.

12:06.810 --> 12:09.605
-Don't you, dad?
-I do, Frankie,

12:10.105 --> 12:12.775
when it's just the two of us.
But, on stage?

12:13.025 --> 12:14.402
In front of everybody?

12:14.943 --> 12:16.487
I... I get really nervous.

12:16.820 --> 12:19.115
It's called stage fright, Frankie.

12:19.198 --> 12:22.283
A lot of people get it when they perform
or speak in front of a group.

12:22.743 --> 12:24.537
You're right, Miss Esmie.

12:24.828 --> 12:26.872
I do get stage fright all the time.

12:27.623 --> 12:29.082
All... the time.

12:29.583 --> 12:32.002
But you're the biggest, strongest
monster there is!

12:32.168 --> 12:34.087
How could you be afraid of anything?

12:34.505 --> 12:36.757
Frankie, remember how you felt

12:36.840 --> 12:39.177
the first time you got up
in front of an audience?

12:39.427 --> 12:41.637
Oh... Oh, yeah.

12:42.220 --> 12:43.847
The stage was so big, and...

12:44.348 --> 12:48.268
the lights were so bright, and...
everybody was looking right at me!

12:49.018 --> 12:50.312
Oh!

12:50.437 --> 12:52.230
That's what stage fright is?

12:52.607 --> 12:53.648
[sighs]

12:53.732 --> 12:58.112
Maybe this is my chance to face my fear
and finally get over it.

12:58.778 --> 13:01.615
If you want to,
you can practice in front of us.

13:02.032 --> 13:03.658
That's a great idea, Katya.

13:03.742 --> 13:07.037
But, first, it's our favorite time of day!

13:07.913 --> 13:09.790

Here goes nothing.

13:55.210 --> 13:56.545
Wow.

13:59.257 --> 14:03.343
See, dad? The whole class is watching.
Everybody things you're great!

14:03.427 --> 14:04.512

14:07.890 --> 14:08.973
Wow!

14:09.057 --> 14:10.225
[laughs]

14:10.350 --> 14:13.853
Uh... Dad? You OK?

14:13.937 --> 14:16.982
Ah!

14:17.650 --> 14:18.733
Ball!

14:24.782 --> 14:27.242

[sighs]

14:30.955 --> 14:32.288
[sighs]

14:36.127 --> 14:38.337
That was fun! Can we do it again?
Can we? Can we?

14:39.003 --> 14:40.380
Yeah!

14:41.298 --> 14:42.842
[both sigh]

14:44.260 --> 14:46.678
So... who wants to help clean up?

14:46.928 --> 14:47.930

15:13.330 --> 15:15.332
Frankie, I'm really sorry but...

15:15.748 --> 15:18.210
I don't think I can juggle
in the talent show.

15:18.293 --> 15:20.378
But... But... You love juggling!

15:20.795 --> 15:23.132
Yeah!

15:23.215 --> 15:24.425
Thanks, everyone!

15:24.508 --> 15:28.970
Frankie, I do love juggling
when it's just you and me.

15:29.053 --> 15:32.557
But... I get so nervous
every time I look at the audience.

15:33.225 --> 15:35.560
-So don't look!
-Spike is right.

15:35.768 --> 15:37.062
Just focus on juggling.

15:37.145 --> 15:40.023
Oh! Maybe you can try
juggling other things too!

15:40.398 --> 15:41.483
Like what?

15:41.567 --> 15:44.570
Like... maybe apples?

15:45.528 --> 15:48.115
-Yeah!
-That would be amazing!

15:50.617 --> 15:53.787
You can do this, dad.
Don't think about the audience.

15:57.207 --> 15:58.625
Wow!

15:58.750 --> 16:00.460
-[laughs]

Yeah!

16:09.512 --> 16:10.678
It's OK, dad.

16:10.762 --> 16:12.597
Just keep juggling.

16:12.765 --> 16:14.600
How about juggling some chairs?

16:14.933 --> 16:16.143
Let's try it.

16:16.227 --> 16:17.812
[laughs]

Snacks!

16:22.482 --> 16:23.858

Doing great, dad!

16:32.367 --> 16:33.910
Yeah!

16:33.993 --> 16:35.995
Thanks, everyone. That was fun!

16:36.122 --> 16:39.123
See? It was just like
when you're juggling at home.

16:39.207 --> 16:42.377
Just remember
to forget about the audience.

16:42.920 --> 16:44.547
The audience...

16:44.630 --> 16:46.132
[sighs]

16:48.342 --> 16:50.218
Nothing up my sleeve,

16:50.302 --> 16:51.887
and nothing in my hat.

16:52.387 --> 16:53.763
Or is there?

16:53.847 --> 16:56.725
Abra-cadabra!

16:56.808 --> 16:58.685
Oh!

It's OK, dad. Remember:

18:07.462 --> 18:09.798
it's just you and me, juggling!

18:11.300 --> 18:12.550
Hi, everybody!

18:12.675 --> 18:15.428
Tonight my dad and I
are going to show you

18:15.512 --> 18:17.722
how easy it is to juggle.

18:18.265 --> 18:20.225
One ball is easy, see?

18:20.392 --> 18:23.562
And two balls,
anyone with two hands can do this.

18:23.937 --> 18:26.648
But, three balls and only two hands?

18:27.065 --> 18:30.027
That's when things get complicated!

18:37.993 --> 18:40.037
-Oh! Hey.
-It's OK, dad.

18:40.120 --> 18:41.872
It's just you and me, juggling.

18:43.248 --> 18:45.542
Yeah!

18:45.625 --> 18:47.418

19:14.487 --> 19:15.613
Hey, Katya.

19:15.697 --> 19:18.575
Yesterday my dad and I went shopping
in the grocery store.

19:18.658 --> 19:20.535
And, do you know what we found?

19:20.660 --> 19:22.787
What did you find?

19:23.622 --> 19:25.540
Oh... We found...

19:26.123 --> 19:27.542
We found...

19:37.427 --> 19:40.430
And... a fire hydrant!

19:40.972 --> 19:43.017
Really? OK!

19:45.518 --> 19:47.312
Huh? A fire hydrant?

19:47.645 --> 19:51.148
What was a fire hydrant doing
in the grocery store?

19:53.110 --> 19:54.485
[laughter]

19:54.570 --> 19:57.072
You just had to ask, didn't you?

19:57.488 --> 20:01.285

It's just you and me, dad!

You're my hero, dad!

20:29.855 --> 20:31.147
And you're mine, Frankie.

20:31.815 --> 20:33.775
Sometimes parents need a little help too.

20:34.275 --> 20:37.737
Even big, strong, monster dad's like me.

20:38.530 --> 20:41.157
Thank you for helping me overcome
my stage fright.

20:41.240 --> 20:42.993

20:43.077 --> 20:45.912
So lucky that I had the Super Monsters
here to help me!

20:46.330 --> 20:49.457
And I'm super-duper lucky
to have a son like you.

20:49.667 --> 20:51.335
Oh, thanks, dad.
