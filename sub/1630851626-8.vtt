What do you think?

00:05.092 --> 00:07.616
Wow. That's...

Wow.

00:09.661 --> 00:12.055
Kudos to your plastic surgeon.

00:12.099 --> 00:14.753
It's a team, actually,
but they're all great.

00:14.797 --> 00:16.886
Who's your gentleman friend?

00:16.929 --> 00:19.149
Spencer.I thought you guys had a fight.

00:19.193 --> 00:20.803
He's an ignorant buffoon,

00:20.846 --> 00:22.631
and I want him to see
what he's missing.

00:22.674 --> 00:23.632
[laughs]

00:23.675 --> 00:24.633
Are you sure you should be

00:24.676 --> 00:25.634
sending a photo that...

00:33.207 --> 00:35.209
Yeah, it is.

00:35.252 --> 00:37.385
Hey, he's not bothering you,
is he?

00:37.428 --> 00:40.605
We've been married so long,
I put up with him.

00:40.649 --> 00:43.130
At least when I get my
belly rubbed, I say thank you.

00:43.173 --> 00:45.958
How-how do you zoom in?

00:46.002 --> 00:48.004
Oh, you just pinch and flick.

I, uh,

00:54.663 --> 00:56.621
I have a favor to ask.Oh, sure.

00:56.665 --> 00:57.927
What's up?Me and Meredith

00:57.970 --> 01:00.103
are celebrating
our anniversary.

01:00.147 --> 01:01.539
It's 55 years.

01:01.583 --> 01:04.020
Oh, wow, that is amazing.Yeah.

01:04.064 --> 01:06.066
My record is three years,

01:06.109 --> 01:08.590
but the guy was in a coma
for half of it.

01:08.633 --> 01:10.287
You're joking, right?

01:10.331 --> 01:13.334
Boy, I wish.

01:13.377 --> 01:15.118
So, your anniversary?

01:15.162 --> 01:17.338
Yes. Meredith always wanted
to go to Paris,

01:17.381 --> 01:19.818
but we never did,
so I thought maybe we could

01:19.862 --> 01:21.690
do a nice, fancy

01:21.733 --> 01:23.083
French dinner tomorrow.

01:23.126 --> 01:25.476
Aw. That is so sweet.

01:25.520 --> 01:27.739
I could have Bert
plan a special menu,

01:27.783 --> 01:30.568
and I could sing a
French song for you guys.

I can dance, too.

Um, you think that you could
cook a fancy French dinner

02:07.214 --> 02:08.476
for Harry and Meredith?

Of course, it's easier for him.
He's only got the one arm.

02:16.875 --> 02:19.704
Um, Bert,

02:19.748 --> 02:23.055
this is really important.
Meredith is very sick,

02:23.099 --> 02:24.883

02:24.927 --> 02:27.059
the last anniversary dinner
they have.

Uh, okay.

No worries. I got this.You sure?
