16:52.320 --> 16:55.608
Sir, where you filming before
the President was shot? Yeah.

16:55.680 --> 16:58.843
So you were standing on top
of this, sir. Is that right?

17:02.400 --> 17:06.040
You couldn't have been
more than 30 yards away.

17:06.119 --> 17:08.691
Sir, would you allow me to take
that film into my possession?

17:10.920 --> 17:14.083
Right now, there are people out
there who are ready to start a war.

17:14.160 --> 17:17.050
The film is that camera is
the only way we have to know

17:17.119 --> 17:19.167
what happened out here today.
You understand that?

17:19.240 --> 17:21.685
<i>It's a matter
of national security.</i>

17:21.760 --> 17:23.046
I need to think.

17:24.800 --> 17:26.768
Sir, I'm no longer asking.

17:26.839 --> 17:28.410
The Dallas News can develop it.

17:28.480 --> 17:30.289
Let's go.

17:35.840 --> 17:37.171
Clear the way.
Nurse.

17:37.240 --> 17:39.208
Can we get some tape here?

17:39.280 --> 17:42.887
Admiral George Burkley, the
President's personal physician.

17:48.560 --> 17:53.168
The President has Addison's Disease.
He'll need these.

17:53.240 --> 17:56.449
I have him on the leg.

17:56.520 --> 17:59.171
<i>Injection is fine.</i>

17:59.240 --> 18:02.244
What's the story on the priest?

18:02.320 --> 18:04.163
He's on the way.

18:19.840 --> 18:21.171
This is it.

18:22.840 --> 18:23.887
No can do.

18:23.960 --> 18:25.769
What do you mean?

18:25.840 --> 18:27.808
That's eight mil. We process 35 stills.
That's it.

18:27.880 --> 18:29.721
You got to be kidding me.
Harry? I didn't know.

18:29.760 --> 18:32.525
Try WFA next door.

18:32.600 --> 18:35.001
There's a Kodak lab out
by Love Field.

18:41.280 --> 18:42.281
A lot more gauze.

18:42.360 --> 18:43.805
Yeah, here.

18:46.040 --> 18:47.963
Let me listen.

18:50.760 --> 18:52.489
I don't hear anything.

18:52.560 --> 18:54.608
You feel anything down there?
Nothing, resume.

18:54.680 --> 18:56.409
Still have no pulse.

19:01.840 --> 19:03.808
Mrs. Kennedy.
Mrs. Kennedy.

19:12.160 --> 19:14.242
Uh, basin?

19:14.320 --> 19:17.403
That's a piece of his skull,
and some brain matter.

19:21.360 --> 19:22.885
Let me listen, let me listen.

19:26.800 --> 19:28.006
No pulse here.

20:10.640 --> 20:12.130
Come on.

20:31.000 --> 20:32.809
<i>Jim...</i>

20:32.880 --> 20:37.761
Jim, you got nothing
to work with.

20:41.640 --> 20:42.766
Jim.

20:45.240 --> 20:46.651
It's time to stop.

20:59.440 --> 21:03.081
I'm calling it.
It's one p.m.

22:17.720 --> 22:20.849
Jackie...

22:20.920 --> 22:22.160
Jackie...

22:27.160 --> 22:32.371
Jackie... it's time
to say good-bye.

22:54.280 --> 22:56.408
Someone please tell me
what's next.

23:03.800 --> 23:05.529
<i>We, uh...</i>

23:08.760 --> 23:10.728
We need a coffin.

23:14.560 --> 23:16.289
Excuse me.

23:41.200 --> 23:42.725
Parkland just called.

23:44.400 --> 23:45.970
He's dead.

24:23.640 --> 24:26.769
Mr. President.

24:26.840 --> 24:27.966
He's gone.

24:31.000 --> 24:32.570
We need to get in the air.

24:35.200 --> 24:41.048
Hey, we belong to Johnson now.

24:41.120 --> 24:43.122
The whole federal
government belongs to him.

24:43.200 --> 24:47.125
When Johnson goes, everyone
has to go with him.

24:47.200 --> 24:52.604
Who stays with Jackie? Jackie
isn't chief executive.

24:52.720 --> 24:58.329
Nor is she related
to one... anymore.

24:58.400 --> 25:01.882
I'm not going
anywhere without her.

25:01.960 --> 25:06.010
<i>Lei' us recall for you
now what has transpired.</i>

25:06.080 --> 25:08.651
<i>KRLD is reporting that they
have been told by somebody</i>

25:08.720 --> 25:12.850
<i>in the hospital
that the President is dead.</i>

25:12.920 --> 25:15.491
Well, that is a repeat
of something

25:15.560 --> 25:18.928
<i>that you heard reported to you directly
a moment ago from KRLD in Dallas.</i>

25:19.000 --> 25:21.128
<i>And that is the rumor
that has reached them</i>

25:21.200 --> 25:25.285
<i>at the hotel
that the President is dead.</i>

25:25.360 --> 25:26.964
I need to go call my wife.

25:27.040 --> 25:28.769
Look, if you want to
stay, you can stay.

25:28.880 --> 25:30.484
If you want to go home
and be with your family...

25:30.560 --> 25:32.528
Go be with your family.

25:32.600 --> 25:35.206
<i>[I TV] We do not' know
what his condition is,</i>

25:35.280 --> 25:38.170
<i>but the report is
that the President is dead.</i>

25:38.240 --> 25:41.961
<i>This is not confirmed.
This is something... Okay.</i>

25:42.040 --> 25:47.763
<i>This is something that</i> the... <i>Word
just came to us a minute ago.</i>

25:47.840 --> 25:51.970
<i>The word we have is that
President Kennedy is dead.</i>

25:52.040 --> 25:58.525
<i>He was shot by an assassin at the intersection
of Elm and Houston Streets just as...</i>

26:15.800 --> 26:20.362
Eternal rest grant
unto him, O Lord,

26:20.440 --> 26:23.091
and let perpetual light
shine upon him.

26:24.440 --> 26:28.331
May he rest
in peace. Amen.

26:28.440 --> 26:31.284
Amen.

26:31.400 --> 26:33.767
Thank you, Father.

26:33.840 --> 26:37.049
Thank you for taking care
of the President.

26:37.120 --> 26:38.804
Please pray for him.

26:38.880 --> 26:41.884
I will.
God bless you.

26:41.960 --> 26:43.291
<i>God bless you.</i>

26:43.360 --> 26:44.930
Father.
God bless...

26:46.440 --> 26:47.965
Thank you.

27:02.280 --> 27:05.363
Let's do this. Why don't we
put our lists together?

27:05.440 --> 27:07.568
We'll split them up
and work down.

27:07.640 --> 27:09.881
L-I got to call you back.

27:09.960 --> 27:12.760
They just picked up somebody in Oak Cliff.
They think he's the shooter.

27:16.760 --> 27:18.888
<i>Shot and killed the
same time as the President</i>

27:18.960 --> 27:21.281
<i>We now have the name
of that suspect</i>

27:21.360 --> 27:23.522
<i>who has been picked up
by Dallas, Texas police</i>

27:23.600 --> 27:26.888
<i>in connection with the slaying
of a Dallas policeman.</i>

27:26.960 --> 27:30.248
<i>The story says the Dallas
Police Department has arrested</i>

27:30.320 --> 27:34.848
<i>a 24 year old man identified
as Lee H. Oswald</i>

27:34.920 --> 27:37.491
<i>in connection with the slaying
of a Dallas policeman</i>

27:37.560 --> 27:40.211
<i>shortly after President
Kennedy was assassinated.</i>

27:40.280 --> 27:42.851
<i>Oswald is also
being interrogated</i>

27:42.920 --> 27:45.321
<i>to see if he had any connection
with the slaying of the President.</i>

27:45.400 --> 27:46.640
Did you hear that?

27:46.720 --> 27:48.404
I did hear that.

27:48.520 --> 27:50.761
<i>Oswald was pulled screaming
and yelling,</i>

27:50.840 --> 27:53.241
<i>from the Texas Theater in the
Oak Cliff section of Dallas.</i>

27:53.320 --> 27:56.767
<i>This story does not say that Oswald
is the man wanted in connection</i>

27:56.840 --> 27:58.683
<i>with the slaying
of the President.</i>

27:58.760 --> 28:01.047
<i>It says that he is
wanted in connection...</i>

28:01.120 --> 28:03.088
Is he talking
about your brother?

28:09.280 --> 28:12.045
Bob? Is
that your brother?

28:17.840 --> 28:19.490
I have to go home.

28:32.240 --> 28:34.322
<i>has been apprehended.</i>

28:34.440 --> 28:36.727
<i>Police are apparently
questioning both of them now.</i>

28:36.800 --> 28:42.728
<i>J- Edgar Hoover has ordered the
full FBI... What</i> are <i>you saying?</i>

28:42.800 --> 28:44.609
Oh, Christ.

28:44.680 --> 28:46.011
<i>Jim.</i>
Just a minute. Wait.

28:52.560 --> 28:54.403
<i>What? What are you
looking for?</i>

28:57.160 --> 28:59.003
Lee Harvey Oswald.

28:59.080 --> 29:01.651
<i>What is this?
Why do you have this?</i>

29:01.760 --> 29:03.046
Why the hell
do you...

29:03.120 --> 29:04.451
This has got to be the guy.

29:04.520 --> 29:05.965
Why the hell do we have this?

29:06.040 --> 29:08.247
This guy works
in the Depository.

29:08.360 --> 29:10.681
Yeah, a hundred feet from where the
President was shot. For how long?

29:10.800 --> 29:12.720
I don't know. A month?
What do you mean, a month?

29:16.840 --> 29:19.161
<i>How do you know this?
'Cause I'm tracking him.</i>

29:19.240 --> 29:21.481
Tracking him? Jesus!
For how long?

29:21.560 --> 29:24.086
18 months.

29:32.120 --> 29:34.885
<i>Found W.
Come here.</i>

29:35.000 --> 29:36.684
Hosty's been tracking
him 18 months.

29:36.760 --> 29:38.250
What the hell for?

29:38.320 --> 29:39.685
You know, I couldn't
even tell you.

29:39.760 --> 29:41.603
He's just a sorry
son of a bitch.

29:41.680 --> 29:43.603
He's one of these guys
who says he's a Marxist,

29:43.680 --> 29:44.886
then he's a revolutionary.

29:44.960 --> 29:46.405
Revolutionary? For who?

29:46.480 --> 29:48.562
Nobody. Nobody wants
this guy.

29:48.720 --> 29:51.087
He defected to the Soviets a
couple years back. Now he's here?

29:51.160 --> 29:53.367
They didn't want him.
Tried to off himself there

29:53.440 --> 29:55.522
They said he could stay
as long as he didn't die.

29:55.600 --> 29:58.171
And I guess he got bored
with that, came back.

29:58.240 --> 30:00.720
Fain did the follow up
interviews on it.

30:00.800 --> 30:03.565
Yeah, a couple of them. Figured there was
nothing there so he closed the file.

30:03.640 --> 30:05.165
It was right before he retired.

30:05.280 --> 30:07.726
Wife's Russian,
so I checked up on her.

30:07.800 --> 30:10.804
Oswald was knocking her around some. That's
why I put him back on the active list.

30:10.880 --> 30:12.120
You actually interview him?

30:12.200 --> 30:13.850
No, he was never around.

30:13.920 --> 30:17.129
When was the last time
you tried?

30:17.200 --> 30:18.565
Two weeks ago.

30:20.480 --> 30:22.448
Two weeks ago?

30:22.520 --> 30:24.887
Yeah.
I saw the wife.

30:26.720 --> 30:31.601
Saw the wife.
Well, today...

30:31.680 --> 30:33.842
her husband
killed the President.

30:40.640 --> 30:42.404
Which one is Sorrels?
I am.

30:42.480 --> 30:44.448
This is Secret Service business.
Let me see it.

30:44.520 --> 30:46.966
F 1.8 zoom lens set for full close up.
So, can you do it?

30:47.080 --> 30:50.368
8 mil is tricky. There's always a risk
with new technology. A risk of what?

30:50.440 --> 30:52.727
8 mil is really
16 mil split in two.

30:52.800 --> 30:54.768
Each frame is really
four frames together.

30:54.840 --> 30:56.763
Two running one way,
two running the other.

30:56.840 --> 30:59.446
It means twice the risk of
overexposure or destruction.

30:59.520 --> 31:03.411
And there's always a percentage of the film
partially or fully destroyed in the process.

31:03.480 --> 31:05.881
Have you done much of
this type of thing?

31:05.960 --> 31:07.962
Three, maybe four times.

31:08.040 --> 31:10.361
And how'd that go?

31:10.440 --> 31:12.442
Look we can still send it
to Rochester if you want.

31:12.520 --> 31:13.965
We need to know
who's behind this.

31:14.040 --> 31:15.963
We don't have
that kind of time.

31:16.040 --> 31:18.361
Listen, I'm temporarily
transferring possession to you.

31:18.480 --> 31:20.005
Nobody looks at it until we do,

31:20.080 --> 31:22.481
and nobody talks
about what's on there.

31:22.560 --> 31:27.771
Mr. Zapruder. Is that
okay with you? Yes.

31:28.800 --> 31:30.040
Okay.

31:35.480 --> 31:38.768
You okay?
I'm upset.

31:38.840 --> 31:40.330
We're all upset.

31:44.880 --> 31:47.201
<i>Latest news from Dallas.
Vice-President Johnson</i>

31:47.280 --> 31:49.408
<i>is being rushed to the
security of Air Force One</i>

31:49.480 --> 31:51.881
<i>for an emergency return

31:51.960 --> 31:54.691
<i>Nobody knows at this hour if the
shooting is part of a wider plot</i>

31:54.760 --> 31:57.081
<i>or the act of one assassinator.</i>

<i>In Washington, nuclear missile

32:06.920 --> 32:09.287
I have to go.
We may have the shooter.

32:09.360 --> 32:11.328
Do not screw me, Harry!

32:11.400 --> 32:13.562
I don't want, what's on that
film all over the papers.

32:13.640 --> 32:14.926
Film stays with Zapruder.

32:15.000 --> 32:16.684
No matter what anybody says,

32:16.760 --> 32:18.601
no matter what's on it,
film doesn't leave you.

32:36.880 --> 32:39.565
Volunteer returning to Angel!
We're leaving now!

32:41.160 --> 32:42.491
Let's go!

32:49.600 --> 32:51.329
<i>Everyone ready?</i>

32:54.560 --> 32:56.528
You all know
what's on here, right?

33:01.680 --> 33:04.650
<i>And you're sure you're ready?</i>

33:04.720 --> 33:06.085
I'm ready.

33:18.520 --> 33:22.241
That's my granddaughter.
I'm sorry. I forgot.

33:24.320 --> 33:27.005
My grandson.

33:27.080 --> 33:29.208
It's your life,
Mr. Zapruder.

33:30.480 --> 33:31.970
Looks like a good life.

33:38.200 --> 33:40.487
Oh, God.

33:55.120 --> 33:56.565
My God.

34:00.520 --> 34:02.727
<i>You have everything.</i>

34:02.800 --> 34:04.848
You have the whole
god damn thing.

34:09.520 --> 34:11.409
Oh, my God.

34:15.040 --> 34:17.042
We're going to need
some copies of that.

34:17.120 --> 34:18.770
I don't have
the right machinery.

34:18.840 --> 34:20.649
You're going to have
to go somewhere else.

34:22.840 --> 34:24.080
Mr. Zapruder.

34:25.920 --> 34:28.241
<i>I wish you luck, sir.</i>

34:37.920 --> 34:40.685
Do not stop!
Go, go, go!

34:40.760 --> 34:44.764
All clear!
This way, sir.

34:44.840 --> 34:46.251
Go!

34:50.800 --> 34:52.449
Go, go!

34:58.200 --> 34:59.964
<i>Who are they?</i>

35:00.040 --> 35:02.042
Dallas police and the FBI.

35:02.160 --> 35:03.764
You sure attract a crowd.

35:05.400 --> 35:06.890
He can ride with me.

35:07.000 --> 35:08.604
He came with us.
He's leaving with us.

35:49.880 --> 35:51.325
Easy.

37:04.480 --> 37:06.369
Yeah, he said to meet him here.

37:06.440 --> 37:09.125
Gentlemen, thank you very much.

37:09.200 --> 37:11.202
We need three copies.

37:11.280 --> 37:14.329
One for the Secret Service. One
for the FBI, and one for me.

37:35.200 --> 37:36.645
Let me through.

37:38.280 --> 37:39.441
Excuse me.

37:39.520 --> 37:40.965
Hold it.
Excuse me.

37:46.120 --> 37:48.600
What are you doing?
Who are you?

37:48.680 --> 37:50.967
I'm the medical examiner.

37:51.080 --> 37:52.969
This is a homicide case.

37:53.080 --> 37:55.606
The deceased can't leave until
there's been an autopsy.

37:57.200 --> 38:00.329
This casket cannot leave
the premises.

38:00.400 --> 38:04.246
I'm the special agent in charge of the
White House detail for the Secret Service.

38:04.320 --> 38:05.970
That is the President
of the United States

38:06.040 --> 38:07.769
and we are taking him
back to Washington.

38:07.840 --> 38:09.490
That's not the way we
do things around here.

38:09.560 --> 38:11.244
It's a Federal crime.

38:11.320 --> 38:13.322
No, it is not. There's
no Federal statue.

38:13.400 --> 38:15.050
It's a murder, it's local,

38:15.120 --> 38:16.724
and it's under
local jurisdiction.

38:16.800 --> 38:18.529
Earl, be very careful here.

38:18.600 --> 38:20.090
That is my body.

38:20.160 --> 38:22.481
The President
is coming with us.

38:22.560 --> 38:25.325
You can't take him. We
have laws here in Texas.

38:25.400 --> 38:26.640
The law can be waived.

38:26.720 --> 38:27.721
Not by me.
I can't do it.

38:27.800 --> 38:28.926
Earl, let him go.

38:29.000 --> 38:30.889
Do you have any idea...

38:30.960 --> 38:33.201
any idea how difficult this
has been for Mrs. Kennedy?

38:33.280 --> 38:36.363
I deal with widows everyday!

38:36.440 --> 38:37.771
The remains will stay here.

38:37.840 --> 38:39.490
I don't think so.
The remains...

38:39.560 --> 38:41.369
What did you call it,
your body?

38:41.440 --> 38:45.206
The hell with you, and
the hell with your law.

38:45.280 --> 38:47.487
Move it out!

38:47.560 --> 38:51.201
The Dallas police is here to execute
the laws of the state of Texas!

38:51.280 --> 38:53.248
Screw the lid
on that coffin now!

38:53.320 --> 38:54.810
Let it go.

39:01.600 --> 39:03.921
You cannot take it.

39:04.000 --> 39:06.321
It's against the law to remove

39:06.400 --> 39:08.926
a corpse from the State
of Texas without permission!

39:09.000 --> 39:10.889
Enough!
<i>You cannot fake if.</i>

39:10.960 --> 39:12.962
We're leaving.
Move!

39:17.160 --> 39:20.642
It's okay, Earl.
You did right.

39:56.240 --> 39:58.242
What a shitty place to die.

40:00.720 --> 40:02.290
You're not driving.

40:02.360 --> 40:04.727
What are you talking about?
Don't.

40:17.880 --> 40:20.486
Please, allow me.

40:20.560 --> 40:22.847
It's okay.

40:25.400 --> 40:27.129
Ma'am.

40:32.240 --> 40:33.730
<i>Bob Bugger, ma'am.</i>

40:33.800 --> 40:35.484
<i>God bless you.</i>

41:25.800 --> 41:27.325
They're five minutes out.

41:31.200 --> 41:33.441
Where we putting the coffin?

41:33.520 --> 41:35.887
I don't know.
I never thought about it.

41:35.960 --> 41:39.123
We're not flying it below
like a piece of luggage.

41:41.080 --> 41:42.809
<i>We're riding it right here.</i>

41:42.880 --> 41:45.645
Let's get these two rows
of seats off the plane.

41:45.720 --> 41:48.963
Look for a tool box. Get some
tools up here, and bodies!

41:54.760 --> 41:56.762
<i>Six bolts.</i>
I <i>need a screwdriver.</i>

41:56.840 --> 41:58.444
<i>We got four minutes.</i>

41:58.520 --> 42:01.808
<i>Six bolts tie it
to the fuselage.</i>

42:01.880 --> 42:04.645
You got it?
You got them?

42:04.720 --> 42:07.291
One, two, three.

42:09.560 --> 42:12.245
Go, go, go.
Let's go.

42:12.320 --> 42:13.560
Watch it.
Watch the back.

42:13.640 --> 42:14.607
Come on.

42:36.880 --> 42:38.644
Come on you guys.

42:46.080 --> 42:48.924
<i>Let's just get the hell
out of here.</i>

42:49.000 --> 42:50.570
All right, come on.
Here we go.

43:01.440 --> 43:04.250
Keep the back end up.
Keep the back end up!

43:20.880 --> 43:22.291
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

43:24.440 --> 43:26.363
Watch that corner. You're
not going to make it.

43:28.840 --> 43:30.683
Let's go.

43:39.520 --> 43:40.726
Come on.

43:42.640 --> 43:43.801
Push it.

43:51.320 --> 43:52.606
All right, come on.

43:59.040 --> 44:00.405
Easy.
Put it down.

44:00.480 --> 44:02.164
Slow...

44:12.760 --> 44:14.444
Dear God.
This work okay, Dave?

44:17.160 --> 44:19.128
This is just fine, Lem.

44:53.080 --> 44:55.765
This is the first time
the Secret Services

44:55.880 --> 44:57.769
has lost a president
under its watch.

45:32.080 --> 45:35.562
I think it may be
months from now.

45:38.200 --> 45:40.089
Hello, excuse me.
I'm sorry.

45:40.160 --> 45:41.571
I'm Robert Oswald.

45:43.440 --> 45:46.489
The man who shot the
President, I'm his brother.

45:55.560 --> 45:57.085
Jackie.

46:19.160 --> 46:21.288
<i>I will faithfully execute...</i>

46:21.360 --> 46:24.443
<i>The office of President
of the United States...</i>

46:24.520 --> 46:27.171
<i>The office of President
of the United States...</i>

46:27.240 --> 46:29.242
<i>I will, to the
best of my ability...</i>

46:29.320 --> 46:31.129
<i>I will, to the
best of my ability...</i>

46:31.200 --> 46:32.804
<i>- Preserve...
- Preserve...</i>

46:32.880 --> 46:34.405
<i>- Protect...
- Protect...</i>

46:34.520 --> 46:36.488
<i>- and defend...
- And defend...</i>

46:36.560 --> 46:38.562
<i>the Constitution
of the United States.</i>

46:38.640 --> 46:40.608
<i>The Constitution
of the United States.</i>

46:40.680 --> 46:42.762
<i>- So help me God.
- So help me God.</i>

46:54.080 --> 46:58.290
So, you finally bothered
to find me.

47:00.200 --> 47:02.487
I'll probably starve now.

47:02.560 --> 47:04.562
Momma's going to need money.

47:04.640 --> 47:06.529
Mother.

47:06.600 --> 47:09.888
I am responsible
for two presidents.

47:09.960 --> 47:11.849
I'm sorry?

47:11.920 --> 47:15.402
Kennedy and now
President Johnson.

47:17.960 --> 47:20.486
I'm not even a Democrat.

47:22.040 --> 47:23.644
Come on.
Let's go.

47:31.680 --> 47:34.650
This room is bugged.
Be careful.

47:34.720 --> 47:37.200
I don't care.

47:37.280 --> 47:39.248
If you know
anything about this,

47:39.320 --> 47:41.846
I want to know
what you know right now.

47:41.960 --> 47:43.883
And no damn stories.

47:46.080 --> 47:52.440
Well, I always knew Lee was some
sort of secret agent. Didn't you?

47:52.520 --> 47:54.329
What are you talking about?

47:54.400 --> 47:57.847
They recruited him
when he was in the Marines.

47:57.920 --> 48:01.720
Who's they?
And what possibly for?

48:01.800 --> 48:05.202
We did.
The U.S. government did.

48:05.280 --> 48:09.490
He was sent on dangerous missions.
The first was to Russia.

48:09.560 --> 48:11.324
Okay, okay,
let me get this straight.

48:11.400 --> 48:14.722
Lee, our Lee...

48:14.800 --> 48:17.451
is a super secret
government spy?

48:17.520 --> 48:19.249
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

48:19.320 --> 48:22.767
Come back from Russia
with a 21 year old wife.

48:22.840 --> 48:26.481
She doesn't speak English.
He can't hold a job.

48:26.560 --> 48:28.881
They have two kids
and not a pot to piss in.

48:28.960 --> 48:30.644
<i>That's impressive.</i>

48:30.760 --> 48:33.843
That is a dangerous fellow,
Lee. And then what?

48:35.280 --> 48:36.611
You know.

48:38.560 --> 48:40.085
You're insane.

48:40.160 --> 48:43.846
Don't you speak
to your mother like that.

48:43.920 --> 48:47.891
Lee Harvey Oswald
has done more for his country

48:47.960 --> 48:50.725
than any other
living human being.

48:52.160 --> 48:55.209
I will never be ordinary again!

49:02.040 --> 49:04.088
I was thinking when
I was waiting for you

49:04.160 --> 49:06.322
about that book
I'm going to write.

49:08.080 --> 49:09.411
What book?

49:11.480 --> 49:14.290
It will have to be
very deeply researched.

49:14.360 --> 49:17.045
A publisher, with money,
will have to come

49:17.120 --> 49:19.600
with a paid writer
to do the work.

49:20.680 --> 49:24.241
Mother...

49:24.320 --> 49:28.211
I just want to make sure you understand
what is happening here today.

49:30.000 --> 49:35.848
Your son, my brother...

49:35.920 --> 49:39.720
has apparently killed the most
important person in the world.

49:40.960 --> 49:43.884
And if that is true,

49:44.000 --> 49:46.606
he is going to die
for what he has done.

49:50.640 --> 49:52.881
It's my story, too.

49:56.120 --> 49:59.442
There he is.
There's Oswald.

49:59.520 --> 50:03.002
<i>Oswald say, "I did
not shoot anybody."</i>

50:03.080 --> 50:05.162
<i>Hold on.</i>

50:05.240 --> 50:08.323
Hold on.
I remember this guy.

50:08.440 --> 50:11.171
Hey, Adam?
What?

50:12.600 --> 50:14.568
He was here.
<i>Who</i> was here?

50:14.640 --> 50:17.041
Oswald was here, in the office.

50:17.120 --> 50:20.329
<i>He left something for Hasty.</i>

50:20.400 --> 50:22.004
Oh, Christ.

50:35.600 --> 50:37.090
Jesus.

50:46.640 --> 50:49.803
Mrs. Oswald! Mrs. Oswald!
Mrs. Oswald! Did he do it?

50:54.600 --> 50:56.045
Mrs. Oswald.

51:04.320 --> 51:07.608
Your mother's a piece of
work, I'll give her that.

51:11.880 --> 51:17.762
I don't know what we're going to do.
I've got two kids.

51:17.840 --> 51:23.882
Well, we're all fathers.
You, me...

51:23.960 --> 51:27.169
the police officer your
brother shot point blank.

51:27.240 --> 51:28.844
The President.

51:28.920 --> 51:31.446
Well, they were.

51:33.880 --> 51:36.326
If I were you,

51:36.400 --> 51:39.563
I'd consider changing my name.

51:39.640 --> 51:41.210
I'd pray I never
needed the help

51:41.280 --> 51:42.691
of the Dallas Police Department

51:42.760 --> 51:45.525
or the Federal
government again.

51:45.600 --> 51:48.604
I'd pack your things
and your wife

51:48.680 --> 51:51.126
and those two children
of yours,

51:51.200 --> 51:53.885
and I'd move as far
from here as I could.

51:53.960 --> 51:56.201
I'd never come back,
even to die.

51:58.680 --> 52:01.968
But... that's
just me.

52:26.480 --> 52:28.164
<i>Oswald has been charged</i>

52:28.240 --> 52:30.891
<i>with the murder
of a police officer.</i>

52:31.000 --> 52:33.002
Where the hell have you been?

52:33.080 --> 52:35.162
I was out doing my job.

52:35.240 --> 52:39.643
Doing your job, huh?
What's this?

52:41.400 --> 52:43.971
Shit, I get three of
these things every week.

52:44.040 --> 52:45.724
This one's from Oswald.

52:45.800 --> 52:47.802
Oswald left this
for you ten days ago.

52:47.880 --> 52:50.087
"You've been talking to my wife
Marina and I don't like you.

52:50.160 --> 52:51.605
"You need to stop
talking to Marina

52:51.680 --> 52:53.091
"or there will be
a price to pay."

52:53.160 --> 52:55.083
I've got 100 of these things.

52:55.160 --> 52:57.447
It says that he's going
to blow up the office.

52:57.520 --> 52:59.409
Three times a week
I get shit like this.

52:59.480 --> 53:02.006
But this was written by the
assassin of the President!

53:02.080 --> 53:04.287
And it was delivered
to this office

53:04.360 --> 53:07.204
in person ten days go, Jim,

53:07.280 --> 53:09.726
which means we had the
assassin of the President

53:09.840 --> 53:13.162
in our office threatening a Federal
officer, which is a crime Not ten days ago.

53:13.280 --> 53:15.328
We did not have the assassin of the President.
For which he could be arrested.

53:15.400 --> 53:18.165
We had another
goddamn delusional nobody!

53:18.240 --> 53:20.004
Yeah, well he's a somebody now!

53:20.080 --> 53:21.844
Never said one word about
killing the President!

53:21.920 --> 53:24.127
No, Only you!

53:24.200 --> 53:27.204
Well, if I worried about every son
of a bitch who wants to shoot me,

53:27.320 --> 53:29.049
I'm in the wrong goddamn business!
Listen.

53:29.120 --> 53:30.724
The world is not going
to care about you.

53:30.800 --> 53:32.450
They're going to say
that we had him.

53:32.560 --> 53:36.201
We had him, and we
could have stopped him!

53:38.400 --> 53:39.890
Jesus Christ.

53:42.720 --> 53:45.326
This might be, probably is,
now that I think about it

53:45.400 --> 53:49.405
the biggest fuck-up in the history
of American law enforcement.

53:57.400 --> 53:58.925
Fuck!

54:01.880 --> 54:04.247
You, follow me.

54:25.960 --> 54:28.725
All right, give me your hands.

54:30.760 --> 54:32.683
Need some help with that?

54:32.760 --> 54:35.764
No, I got it. I need some
help from you to shut up.

54:37.480 --> 54:38.561
Sit down, Lee!

55:11.240 --> 55:12.685
How are you?

55:16.680 --> 55:19.684
I don't think you've ever asked
me that question in my life.

55:23.400 --> 55:25.562
I'm really confused.

55:27.720 --> 55:30.451
Maybe you can tell
me what-what...

55:32.880 --> 55:34.405
What is going on?

55:35.560 --> 55:38.040
I don't know.

55:38.120 --> 55:42.887
They have your pistol, they have
your rifle, and they've charged you

55:42.960 --> 55:45.201
and you're telling me
you don't know.

55:48.680 --> 55:51.411
God damn it, just
tell me what you did.

55:51.480 --> 55:56.042
Don't believe all
this so-called evidence.

55:59.520 --> 56:03.081
What's Marina going
to do with the kids now?

56:03.160 --> 56:05.242
I don't know.
Well, we have friends.

56:06.440 --> 56:08.090
Junie needs new shoes.

56:08.160 --> 56:10.162
Oh, she needs new shoes.

56:11.680 --> 56:14.001
How about a goddamn father?

56:14.080 --> 56:15.969
How about a killer
for a father?

56:16.040 --> 56:18.088
How about the killer of the
President for a father?

56:20.320 --> 56:22.129
You're worried about shoes.

56:22.200 --> 56:24.043
Do you have any idea
what you've done?

56:24.120 --> 56:26.441
You've ruined that kid's life.
Both those kids' lives!

56:26.520 --> 56:28.887
So forget the goddamn
stupid shoes!

56:43.760 --> 56:47.685
<i>Can you hear me? Put' the
phone to your ear, all right?</i>

56:47.800 --> 56:50.167
Look at me.

56:50.240 --> 56:52.049
I'm sorry.

56:58.560 --> 57:00.528
Well, I'm going
to get you a lawyer.

57:00.600 --> 57:02.170
Stay out of it.

57:02.240 --> 57:03.480
<i>Stay out of it?</i>

57:04.640 --> 57:06.847
My children, my wife,

57:06.920 --> 57:13.644
my children's children,
all of us, for all of eternity.

57:15.520 --> 57:17.841
You did this to all of us.

57:20.680 --> 57:22.364
I don't know who
you think you are,

57:22.440 --> 57:25.284
but I am your brother.

57:25.360 --> 57:29.126
And I'll find you an attorney
and be back in a day or two.

57:33.000 --> 57:34.843
Don't be running back
and forth all the time

57:34.920 --> 57:37.491
and getting yourself in
trouble with your boss.

57:42.160 --> 57:42.763
<i>Time to go.</i>

58:44.920 --> 58:46.649
What did he say?

58:46.720 --> 58:50.725
I don't know. I have
no idea who that was.

59:18.840 --> 59:20.080
Thank you, sir.

59:44.880 --> 59:46.962
It's been ringing all night.

59:47.040 --> 59:49.407
<i>Everybody wants that film.</i>

01:00:47.120 --> 01:00:48.849
Hello?

01:00:48.920 --> 01:00:50.410
<i>I'd like to speak
to Mr. Zapruder, please.</i>

01:00:50.480 --> 01:00:52.687
This is Abraham Zapruder.

01:00:52.760 --> 01:00:55.650
<i>My name is Dick Stolley. I'm
the editor of Life magazine.</i>

01:00:55.720 --> 01:00:59.247
<i>I'd like to talk to you
tonight about your film.</i>

01:00:59.320 --> 01:01:02.483
You know what? Not tonight.
No. I'm very tired.

01:01:02.560 --> 01:01:04.528
I'm upset. It's been
an upsetting day.

01:01:04.600 --> 01:01:06.602
I'm sure you can understand.

01:01:06.680 --> 01:01:08.444
<i>I understand completely,
but I need to come see you</i>

01:01:08.560 --> 01:01:09.925
<i>as soon as possible.</i>

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:11.764
Yeah, tomorrow morning, okay.

01:01:11.840 --> 01:01:13.604
<i>Okay, tomorrow morning then.
Thank you.</i>

01:01:13.680 --> 01:01:14.920
Sure. Thank you.

01:01:17.040 --> 01:01:21.887
Let's go home, Abe. It's enough.
It's enough.

01:01:23.720 --> 01:01:25.529
MY eyes.

01:01:33.680 --> 01:01:35.921
<i>We're about to wind
this up for tonight,</i>

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:39.846
<i>because all that could happen
on one day has.</i>

01:01:39.920 --> 01:01:44.244
<i>For some final reflection on
one of the more horrible days</i>

01:01:44.320 --> 01:01:48.325
<i>in American history, you find there
is a great deal that could be said</i>

01:01:48.400 --> 01:01:50.448
<i>about the political
and other changes</i>

01:01:50.560 --> 01:01:52.562
<i>that we can look
forward to now,</i>

01:01:52.640 --> 01:01:54.760
<i>but I think it' would be
bad taste to go into it' now.</i>

01:01:54.800 --> 01:01:56.325
<i>And I won't.</i>

01:01:56.440 --> 01:01:59.205
<i>It has all been shocking.</i>

01:01:59.280 --> 01:02:03.968
<i>By the Washington clock, at a little
after one o'clock this afternoon,</i>

01:02:04.040 --> 01:02:10.286
<i>President Kennedy was alive as any human
being ever gets, young, strong, vigorous,</i>

01:02:10.360 --> 01:02:15.321
<i>looking forward to, no doubt, five more
years, he hoped of leadership in this country</i>

01:02:15.400 --> 01:02:17.721
<i>and of the western world.</i>

01:02:17.800 --> 01:02:21.327
<i>There is no more news here tonight,
and really no more to say,</i>

01:02:21.400 --> 01:02:27.089
<i>except that was has happened today has been
just too much, too ugly, and too fast.</i>

01:02:37.080 --> 01:02:39.242
Good morning,
lam Dr. Perry.

01:02:39.320 --> 01:02:41.641
What seems to be bothering you?

01:02:47.320 --> 01:02:50.005
How's our patient doing?
Fine.

01:02:53.320 --> 01:02:55.129
And our resident?

01:03:00.040 --> 01:03:02.884
Okay, good.

01:03:20.720 --> 01:03:22.449
Turn off the lights please.

01:04:02.440 --> 01:04:03.851
Jesus Christ.

01:04:13.440 --> 01:04:14.805
We blew it.

01:04:14.880 --> 01:04:16.370
Shut up!

01:04:16.440 --> 01:04:20.240
Did you see that?
Did you see that?

01:04:20.320 --> 01:04:21.765
We blew it!

01:04:21.840 --> 01:04:23.444
That wasn't a damn
Easter parade,

01:04:23.520 --> 01:04:25.522
that's the President
of the United States!

01:04:25.600 --> 01:04:27.728
Do you understand me!

01:04:27.880 --> 01:04:31.521
You think we need your goddamn
opinion about anything! No, sir.

01:04:31.600 --> 01:04:35.810
I've been doing this job for 30 years!
I have never lost my man!

01:04:35.880 --> 01:04:38.042
<i>This was not
supposed to happen!</i>

01:04:38.120 --> 01:04:41.044
Yesterday, I lost my man.

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:58.607
Thank you, gentlemen, if you would
wait outside for a moment please.

01:04:58.680 --> 01:04:59.920
Thank you.

01:05:05.360 --> 01:05:07.328
<i>This is no time
to point' fingers.</i>

01:05:07.400 --> 01:05:10.768
<i>This is a time of...</i>

01:05:18.800 --> 01:05:23.488
Dick Stolley.
Life magazine.

01:05:23.560 --> 01:05:25.801
We spoke last night. Yeah,
I know who you are.

01:05:34.800 --> 01:05:41.251
My father brought my family
over here 40 years ago

01:05:41.320 --> 01:05:42.845
to escape certain death.

01:05:44.760 --> 01:05:46.364
<i>We worked hard,</i>

01:05:46.440 --> 01:05:50.570
built a good, honest life.

01:05:51.800 --> 01:05:55.361
An American life.

01:05:55.440 --> 01:05:57.522
<i>Sir, we'd like to talk to
you about making a deal.</i>

01:05:57.640 --> 01:06:00.610
But I guess all
of that is over.

01:06:00.680 --> 01:06:03.160
Nothing is ever going
to be the same.

01:06:03.240 --> 01:06:08.167
I wish I never took
this film, Mr. Stolley.

01:06:08.240 --> 01:06:10.720
But now I'm going to
have to live with it.

01:06:12.840 --> 01:06:14.968
<i>Don '2' make a deal without
talking to us first, sir.</i>

01:06:15.040 --> 01:06:16.929
I admire you, you know.

01:06:19.160 --> 01:06:20.650
I've been to war.

01:06:20.720 --> 01:06:23.166
Know what it's like
to use a camera.

01:06:25.360 --> 01:06:26.850
You kept shooting.

01:06:26.960 --> 01:06:31.329
No, no. It wasn't
a war, Mr. Stolley.

01:06:34.480 --> 01:06:36.687
I filmed a murder.

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:41.480
Mr. Zapruder, we're going to slip
an offer underneath the door.

01:06:43.600 --> 01:06:46.001
God, if I open this door,

01:06:46.080 --> 01:06:49.402
it is going to be
impossible for both of us.

01:06:49.480 --> 01:06:52.370
Don't make me negotiate
with those people.

01:06:52.440 --> 01:06:54.044
Don't make me go out there.

01:06:54.120 --> 01:06:56.043
Life magazine is just
as anxious as you are

01:06:56.120 --> 01:06:58.088
to give your pictures
a respectable display.

01:06:58.200 --> 01:07:00.282
<i>Mr. Zapruder, CBS.</i>

01:07:00.360 --> 01:07:03.364
Well, that is why you are standing
in this room, Mr. Stolley,

01:07:03.440 --> 01:07:06.728
because I trust that.
I trust your magazine.

01:07:06.800 --> 01:07:10.247
And I want to say very clearly

01:07:10.320 --> 01:07:13.210
I know what this is,

01:07:13.280 --> 01:07:15.123
and what it's done.

01:07:17.800 --> 01:07:19.848
What it is going to do.

01:07:22.120 --> 01:07:25.727
So if you want a chance to do
the right thing with this film

01:07:27.360 --> 01:07:28.921
then you're going to
have to pay for it.

01:07:30.920 --> 01:07:33.810
You have to pay to keep it safe

01:07:33.880 --> 01:07:36.406
and to protect me
and my family.

01:07:40.640 --> 01:07:41.971
I think I understand.

01:07:42.040 --> 01:07:44.247
And one other thing.

01:07:47.280 --> 01:07:52.411
When the President is...
when he's

01:07:52.480 --> 01:07:54.005
The kill shot?
Yeah.

01:07:57.040 --> 01:07:59.247
You will publish those frames?

01:07:59.320 --> 01:08:00.970
Because I think
you would agree,

01:08:01.040 --> 01:08:03.281
some things the world
does not need to see.

01:08:03.360 --> 01:08:04.725
Would you not?

01:08:04.800 --> 01:08:06.450
Normally yes, but in this case

01:08:06.560 --> 01:08:08.289
missing frames could lead
to false speculation.

01:08:08.360 --> 01:08:10.010
That is none of my business.

01:08:10.080 --> 01:08:13.243
I don't... I don't care
about all of that.

01:08:15.320 --> 01:08:18.323
I'm talking about
the man's dignity.

01:08:18.399 --> 01:08:19.765
<i>We have a responsibility.</i>

01:08:19.840 --> 01:08:21.649
A dignified man,
you understand.

01:08:21.720 --> 01:08:24.724
It's a very undignified end
for a very dignified man!

01:08:30.880 --> 01:08:32.564
You have something to write on?

01:08:42.880 --> 01:08:44.529
<i>There is the prisoner.</i>

01:08:47.240 --> 01:08:48.924
<i>There is Lee Harvey Oswald.</i>

01:08:50.680 --> 01:08:52.569
<i>What'?
He has been shot!</i>

01:08:52.640 --> 01:08:53.926
<i>He's been shot.</i>

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:56.002
<i>Lee Oswald has been shot!</i>

01:08:56.080 --> 01:08:57.604
<i>There's a man with a gun.</i>

01:08:57.680 --> 01:08:59.011
Oswald has been shot!
Right now.

01:08:59.080 --> 01:09:00.729
Jesus Christ, right on live TV.

01:09:01.720 --> 01:09:03.370
<i>God damn!</i>

01:09:03.439 --> 01:09:05.488
<i>Absolute panic here
at headquarters.</i>

01:09:05.560 --> 01:09:08.245
<i>Oswald has been shot.</i>

01:09:08.319 --> 01:09:12.120
<i>There is no question.
Oswald has been shot.</i>

01:09:12.200 --> 01:09:14.805
<i>Detectives have
their guns drawn.</i>

01:09:14.920 --> 01:09:19.368
We have not heard from
Mr. Stolley or his associates

01:09:19.439 --> 01:09:23.081
at Life magazine
since yesterday evening.

01:09:23.160 --> 01:09:25.242
And Lee Oswald's wife
and children and I...

01:09:25.319 --> 01:09:27.640
are stranded alone
at a strange motel

01:09:27.720 --> 01:09:29.370
in the middle of nowhere.

01:09:29.439 --> 01:09:32.841
We are waiting to hear
about our cash deal.

01:09:35.720 --> 01:09:40.169
Thank you. I shall
be waiting right here.

01:09:43.640 --> 01:09:47.281
We are the Mrs. Oswalds.

01:09:47.359 --> 01:09:49.488
We need money.

01:09:49.560 --> 01:09:51.163
We need a place to stay

01:09:51.240 --> 01:09:52.924
where we can hide from everyone

01:09:53.040 --> 01:09:57.125
and we need a new place
to live, dear heart.

01:09:57.200 --> 01:10:03.003
All we do is rush around from one place
to another, in the grand exodus.

01:10:03.080 --> 01:10:05.447
The baby's diapers are wet.

01:10:05.520 --> 01:10:08.000
We are hungry as all get out.
Mother!

01:10:11.360 --> 01:10:12.885
<i>Hey, Mike.
Get out here.</i>

01:10:17.920 --> 01:10:22.721
Something's going on. They're
running around outside.

01:10:26.600 --> 01:10:31.447
Don't get excited.
Lee's been shot.

01:10:33.040 --> 01:10:34.644
It isn't serious.

01:10:34.720 --> 01:10:37.200
And they got the man
who shot him.

01:10:42.240 --> 01:10:44.004
Where are they taking him?

01:10:44.080 --> 01:10:45.161
Parkland.

01:10:52.080 --> 01:10:55.004
No! He is not living or dying
in there. Room two!

01:10:59.160 --> 01:11:00.844
How many bullets?
Where's the respirator?

01:11:02.160 --> 01:11:04.083
Where's Perry?

01:11:04.160 --> 01:11:05.810
Gauze.

01:11:05.880 --> 01:11:08.360
There's Clark.
What's the blood pressure?

01:11:08.440 --> 01:11:09.965
100 over 85.
It's going down.

01:11:10.040 --> 01:11:11.929
I don't like this.
Let's open him up.

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:14.606
We're going to need some suction.
Get suction ready.

01:11:18.280 --> 01:11:20.203
From one bullet?
Yeah, one point blank.

01:11:20.280 --> 01:11:21.645
Let's start left, go right.

01:11:21.720 --> 01:11:24.166
Right kidney gone, spleen gone.

01:11:24.240 --> 01:11:25.765
We're going to have to get in there.
Right there.

01:11:25.840 --> 01:11:28.491
Need more gauze.
Got it.

01:11:28.560 --> 01:11:30.164
BP 100 over 85.

01:11:30.240 --> 01:11:32.129
We might get to keep this one.

01:11:32.200 --> 01:11:34.282
Do we want to?

01:11:34.360 --> 01:11:35.521
We need a confession.

01:11:35.600 --> 01:11:36.931
What if he dies?

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:38.843
We need a confession first.

01:11:38.920 --> 01:11:40.729
Don't we all.

01:11:40.800 --> 01:11:42.131
Damn it!

01:11:42.200 --> 01:11:43.770
Blood pressure is going down.

01:11:43.840 --> 01:11:46.081
85 over 40. We need more blood!
Nurse.

01:11:46.160 --> 01:11:47.924
Zero, nothing.

01:11:49.960 --> 01:11:52.611
I've got the lung.
Massage the heart.

01:11:52.680 --> 01:11:54.523
Nothing.
Adrenalin now.

01:11:54.600 --> 01:11:56.204
Adrenalin!
Come on!

01:11:58.240 --> 01:12:01.289
All right, Jim hold it
right there. Open!

01:12:01.360 --> 01:12:02.282
Nothing.

01:12:02.360 --> 01:12:03.486
Jim, paddles!

01:12:03.560 --> 01:12:04.402
Paddles.
Paddles.

01:12:04.480 --> 01:12:05.891
Paddles.

01:12:10.120 --> 01:12:10.962
200.

01:12:11.040 --> 01:12:11.848
Clear.

01:12:13.680 --> 01:12:15.364
Nothing.

01:12:15.440 --> 01:12:17.044
Again.
360.

01:12:17.120 --> 01:12:18.007
Clear.

01:12:19.400 --> 01:12:20.811
Nothing.
Still nothing.

01:12:20.880 --> 01:12:23.008
500.
Clear.

01:12:23.080 --> 01:12:24.081
Nothing.

01:12:24.160 --> 01:12:25.366
700.
Clear.

01:12:32.920 --> 01:12:35.207
Time.
1:07.

01:12:35.280 --> 01:12:36.361
Dammit.

01:12:51.920 --> 01:12:53.684
Yes, this is Mike Howard.

01:12:55.880 --> 01:12:58.008
<i>I'm sorry,
will you repeat that?</i>

01:13:00.280 --> 01:13:01.645
<i>Thank you.</i>

01:13:06.280 --> 01:13:07.406
He's gone?

01:13:08.720 --> 01:13:10.290
I'm sorry, Robert.

01:13:22.600 --> 01:13:26.241
Lee was an agent
for the U.S. government.

01:13:26.320 --> 01:13:30.609
He should be buried at Arlington
Cemetery with President Kennedy.

01:13:30.680 --> 01:13:32.250
Shut up, mother.

01:13:55.880 --> 01:13:58.247
He's staying here.

01:13:58.320 --> 01:14:01.927
This time, I don't think anyone's
going to give you a hard time.

01:14:20.120 --> 01:14:22.691
Your name is Robert.
Is that right, son?

01:14:24.400 --> 01:14:25.640
That's right.

01:14:28.880 --> 01:14:30.882
I'm sorry for you.

01:14:33.160 --> 01:14:35.003
I'm sorry for everybody.

01:15:17.760 --> 01:15:19.888
<i>-... a brief stop
at the White House.</i>

01:15:19.960 --> 01:15:23.282
<i>Then Mrs. Kennedy followed
the casket on foot...</i>

01:15:23.360 --> 01:15:25.089
<i>to St. Matthews Church.</i>

01:15:29.400 --> 01:15:32.290
I don't think you all
should listen to this.

01:15:32.360 --> 01:15:33.885
No, please leave it.

01:15:37.320 --> 01:15:38.560
Thank you.

01:15:52.480 --> 01:15:57.805
Bring him in.

01:15:57.880 --> 01:15:59.405
Close the blinds for me.

01:16:12.160 --> 01:16:14.003
We're getting killed, Jim.

01:16:16.360 --> 01:16:18.249
<i>What happened in this office...</i>

01:16:19.640 --> 01:16:24.282
What we did...
what you did...

01:16:24.360 --> 01:16:25.600
What do you want, Gordon?

01:16:28.200 --> 01:16:29.804
You were in the military,
right, Jim?

01:16:29.880 --> 01:16:31.928
<i>Yeah, Army.</i>

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:33.331
Are you firing me?

01:16:39.800 --> 01:16:41.689
<i>I don't ever
want to see that again.</i>

01:16:45.560 --> 01:16:49.121
What the hell am I
supposed to do with it?

01:16:49.200 --> 01:16:54.730
Oswald's dead now.
A thousand what-ifs.

01:16:59.160 --> 01:17:00.730
86 'em.

01:17:03.680 --> 01:17:05.284
This is evidence.

01:17:05.360 --> 01:17:07.040
Well it's not evidence
if there's no trial.

01:17:07.080 --> 01:17:10.527
And there sure as shit
won't be a trial now.

01:17:10.600 --> 01:17:13.649
<i>I know what that is, Jim.</i>

01:17:13.720 --> 01:17:15.484
<i>I'm asking you to destroy it.</i>

01:17:18.480 --> 01:17:20.687
I think we all know
what is at stake here.

01:17:29.800 --> 01:17:31.484
<i>Wait...</i>

01:17:33.240 --> 01:17:34.571
You want this?

01:18:30.360 --> 01:18:32.249
Why aren't we doing this
in the church?

01:18:33.840 --> 01:18:36.320
Well, no church will do it.

01:18:36.440 --> 01:18:38.283
What about that cemetery
chapel over there?

01:18:38.400 --> 01:18:39.811
They won't allow it either.

01:18:42.560 --> 01:18:46.724
You only have this grave site
because a friend owed me a favor.

01:18:46.800 --> 01:18:50.247
And I'm sorry, but there
are no pallbearers.

01:19:09.840 --> 01:19:15.404
Can you help us, please?

01:19:26.880 --> 01:19:28.450
Thank you.

01:19:47.880 --> 01:19:53.649
<i>The remains of John F. Kennedy
are about to pass a memorial</i>

01:19:53.720 --> 01:19:56.963
<i>to another president.</i>

01:20:13.760 --> 01:20:16.081
<i>The stamina of this woman...</i>

01:20:16.160 --> 01:20:22.930
<i>through these past three or four
days has been indescribable.</i>

01:21:34.040 --> 01:21:36.691
<i>I haven '2' done a burial
in eight years,</i>

01:21:39.360 --> 01:21:41.886
<i>but someone has to help
this family.</i>

01:21:45.080 --> 01:21:50.086
God of the open sky
and of the infinite universe,

01:21:50.160 --> 01:21:54.927
<i>we pray and petition for this
family who are heartbroken.</i>

01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:58.846
<i>Those who suffer and in his
hearts are full of fears.</i>

01:21:58.920 --> 01:22:00.922
<i>We'll pray for them.</i>

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:03.480
For their need is great.

01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:07.446
May God have mercy
on your soul.

01:23:36.280 --> 01:23:37.884
<i>or if these dark
days are harbingers</i>

01:23:37.960 --> 01:23:40.042
<i>of even blacker ones to come,</i>

01:23:40.160 --> 01:23:42.367
<i>Might the black
before the dawn...</i>

01:23:42.440 --> 01:23:46.047
<i>lead to some still
as yet indiscernible sunrise</i>

01:23:46.120 --> 01:23:48.361
<i>of understanding among men.</i>

01:23:48.440 --> 01:23:51.728
<i>Violent words, no matter what
their origin or motivation...</i>

01:23:51.800 --> 01:23:52.961
Hail Mary, full of grace,

01:23:53.040 --> 01:23:54.690
the Lord is with thee.

01:23:56.360 --> 01:23:58.169
<i>Blessed art thou amongst women,</i>

01:23:58.240 --> 01:24:00.607
<i>and blessed is the fruit

01:24:02.520 --> 01:24:04.682
<i>Holy Mary, mother of God,
pray for us sinners,</i>

01:24:04.760 --> 01:24:06.603
<i>now and at the hour
of our death.</i>

01:24:10.200 --> 01:24:12.248
<i>Tonight, there
will be few Americans</i>

01:24:12.320 --> 01:24:14.288
<i>who will go to bed
without carrying with them</i>

01:24:14.400 --> 01:24:17.563
<i>the sense that somehow
they have failed.</i>

01:24:17.640 --> 01:24:19.688
<i>If in the search

01:24:19.760 --> 01:24:22.286
<i>we find a new dedication
to the American concept</i>

01:24:22.360 --> 01:24:27.321
<i>that brook no political, sectional,
religious or racial divisions.</i>

<i>Ana' it may yet be possible to
say that John Fitzgerald Kennedy</i>

01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:34.241
