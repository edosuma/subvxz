00:00.073 --> 00:04.567
T.C.'s chopper was used to bust a guy
out of prison. Must have been skyjacked.

00:07.046 --> 00:09.514
- What's happening?
- Get ready for a bath.

00:09.549 --> 00:12.074
- Why did he say that?
- We're going to crash-land.

00:12.118 --> 00:14.086
- Any sign of his chopper?
- Nothing.

00:14.120 --> 00:17.248
Killing me will only exacerbate
your culpability.

00:17.290 --> 00:19.281
You're gonna have to shoot me too.

00:19.325 --> 00:22.294
What, are you crazy?
Thomas is gonna shoot you.

00:22.328 --> 00:23.818
Why would Magnum come?

00:23.863 --> 00:27.321
Thomas Magnum broke a code,
a soldier's code.

00:28.701 --> 00:29.963
Magnum!

01:51.751 --> 01:55.744
<i>This morning in paradise was
not much better than the one yesterday.</i>

01:55.788 --> 01:58.256
<i>In other words, it was perfect</i>.

01:58.291 --> 02:01.124
<i>And morning in paradise
is the perfect time of day.</i>

02:01.160 --> 02:03.321
<i>A quiet run and then a swim</i>.

02:03.362 --> 02:06.195
<i>It's a time you're truly alone,</i>

02:06.232 --> 02:09.929
<i>a time when you're allowed
to fully appreciate the rhythms of living.</i>

02:09.969 --> 02:13.097
<i>Besides, Higgins was
going to be gone all day.</i>

02:13.139 --> 02:17.542
<i>And that made me appreciate
the rhythms of living even more.</i>

02:54.680 --> 02:56.341
Come on.

03:07.793 --> 03:09.954
- All right?
- They got across the road.

03:09.996 --> 03:12.157
Right in front of me. I didn't have no time.

03:12.198 --> 03:14.792
- It's all right.
- You saw it, didn't you?

03:14.834 --> 03:16.995
- No, I didn't.
- You saw it, didn't you?

03:17.036 --> 03:19.800
- No, no, hold still.
- I'm up a big creek now.

03:19.839 --> 03:23.104
- My boss. I'm gonna be late.
- It's all right.

03:23.142 --> 03:26.373
- Don't worry. I'll work out something.
- You'd better.

03:26.412 --> 03:28.403
We got to get back for the luau by two.

03:28.447 --> 03:33.043
The social obligations of these gentlemen
are irrelevant. I have an appointment.

03:33.085 --> 03:36.953
- Well, so do we, at eight o'clock.
- Perhaps you have the wrong day.

03:36.989 --> 03:38.980
Thursday, today!

03:40.326 --> 03:44.160
Look, our charter goes back
to Kansas City tomorrow.

03:44.197 --> 03:48.133
This is the last chance we'll have
to get slides for the Rotary club.

03:48.167 --> 03:50.658
- You made us a deal.
- I also had a deal.

03:50.703 --> 03:53.729
The Anglo-Polynesian Botanical Society
commissioned me

03:53.773 --> 03:57.800
to take aerial photographs of flora
for the next issue of their magazine.

03:57.843 --> 03:59.674
I am working on deadline.

03:59.712 --> 04:04.046
Listen, Higgins, Mr. Curry,
Mr. Bryce, I'm really sorry.

04:04.083 --> 04:07.211
I must have messed up
in my paperwork, or files.

04:07.253 --> 04:10.017
I thought you were coming next Thursday.

04:10.056 --> 04:12.524
Maybe I can take
all three of you up together.

04:12.558 --> 04:15.026
- Fine, let's go.
- Absolutely not.

04:16.796 --> 04:19.629
Listen, Higgins, I'll give you a discount.

04:20.565 --> 04:23.228
- How much?
- 20%%%.

04:23.269 --> 04:24.930
- 60.
- 30.

04:24.971 --> 04:29.670
50. He had to be doing at least 50
when he went over that rise.

04:29.709 --> 04:33.201
- He just missed me.
- And you didn't see the collision?

04:33.246 --> 04:36.374
No, I heard it. I was still
trying to get my heart started.

04:36.415 --> 04:38.406
Thank you. We'll be in touch.

04:39.986 --> 04:42.819
- That's all?
- Yes, sir.

04:42.855 --> 04:46.518
You're not charging him?
I mean, he was driving recklessly.

04:46.559 --> 04:49.392
You just said you didn't see the accident.

04:49.428 --> 04:52.261
Besides, the breathalyzer test was negative.

04:52.298 --> 04:55.426
The positioning of the vehicles
tend to support his story.

04:55.468 --> 04:59.461
We've no reason to take Mr. Cobb
other than but to a hospital.

04:59.505 --> 05:02.497
Thank you for your cooperation,
Mr. Magnum.

05:04.644 --> 05:05.975
Officer.

05:08.114 --> 05:12.107
- The man in the car, who was he?
- That's one for the coroner.

05:12.151 --> 05:14.984
The car was a rental.
Probably a tourist.

05:21.260 --> 05:23.956
You know, I take up
maybe 50 tourists a month.

05:23.996 --> 05:26.521
Never made a mistake like this before.

05:27.967 --> 05:30.800
Guess there's a first time for everything.

05:33.172 --> 05:35.163
What kind of film are you using?

05:35.207 --> 05:39.303
Personally, for aerial photography,
I prefer high-speed reversal stock,

05:39.345 --> 05:42.109
which the lab can push up a stop if necessary.

05:42.148 --> 05:44.082
I get mine at the drugstore.

05:51.557 --> 05:53.422
What discount are we gonna get?

05:53.459 --> 05:57.020
Discount?
What do you mean, discount?

06:00.533 --> 06:02.524
It's on the house.

06:02.568 --> 06:04.399
Relax.

06:05.404 --> 06:08.532
- I say.
- We're changing course.

06:09.542 --> 06:11.476
To where?

06:34.967 --> 06:36.628
<i>Your attention</i>.

06:36.669 --> 06:40.662
<i>All inmates assigned to Block B,
lockup will be in ten minutes.</i>

06:40.706 --> 06:43.504
<i>Block B, ten minutes to lockup</i>.

07:54.747 --> 07:56.738
Get us out of here!

08:47.466 --> 08:50.594
Thomas, I came right over
just as soon as I heard the news.

08:50.636 --> 08:53.196
What? The crash is on the news already?

08:53.239 --> 08:55.707
- Crash? Don't you know?
- Know what?

08:55.741 --> 08:59.837
T.C.'s chopper was used to bust a guy
out of prison. Must have been skyjacked.

08:59.879 --> 09:01.540
- When?
- About a half-hour ago.

09:04.383 --> 09:07.216
Higgins. Higgins was going up with him.

09:14.927 --> 09:19.387
I urge you to turn back at once.
This is an exercise in futility.

09:19.431 --> 09:22.025
- One that will...
- End in abject failure.

09:22.067 --> 09:24.365
I know. You've already told me.

09:24.403 --> 09:26.928
So now just shut up or else you'll swim.

09:26.972 --> 09:28.735
Where did you get him, anyway?

09:30.843 --> 09:32.868
Change course. Head for Kauai.

09:32.912 --> 09:36.404
Kauai? Never make it, man.
They'll pick us up on radar.

09:36.448 --> 09:38.746
Not if we fly under it.

09:38.784 --> 09:41.617
I want to feel the spray on my face.

09:41.654 --> 09:43.519
Air's too choppy.

09:43.556 --> 09:47.652
You'll feel more than spray on your face.
Most likely sharks.

09:49.929 --> 09:53.695
Besides, man, I'm losing fuel.
A bullet must have hit my fuel line.

09:54.433 --> 09:56.401
I heard you were good, Mr. Calvin.

09:57.403 --> 09:59.837
Don't disappoint me.

09:59.872 --> 10:01.772
Do it.

10:42.314 --> 10:45.283
There's the island, bear right.

11:04.770 --> 11:07.364
- What's happening?
- Are we going to make it?

11:07.406 --> 11:10.375
Get ready for a bath.
Just keep flying.

11:10.409 --> 11:15.108
There's a clearing on the other side
of the island where you'll touch down.

11:15.147 --> 11:17.138
No way, Mister.

11:23.122 --> 11:26.023
We'll hit the clearing in three minutes.

11:26.058 --> 11:27.719
You've got to be kidding.

11:28.460 --> 11:30.758
- Why did he say that?
- It's quite obvious.

11:30.796 --> 11:33.458
We're going to crash-land right here.

11:42.474 --> 11:44.465
Hold on, everybody.

12:02.859 --> 12:04.850
Damn.

12:07.397 --> 12:12.460
Seven years of work,
flying other people's machines.

12:13.370 --> 12:15.668
Saving, waiting...

12:15.705 --> 12:18.833
You didn't happen to see
the 90 by 230 zoom by any chance?

12:18.875 --> 12:22.538
What are you talking about zooms for?
They just wrecked my chopper.

12:22.579 --> 12:24.877
I'm sure insurance will take care of it.

12:24.915 --> 12:29.011
I'm responsible for having possibly
damaged two of Mr. Masters' cameras.

12:29.052 --> 12:32.180
It's a ridiculous situation
you've gotten me into.

12:32.222 --> 12:34.213
- Me?
- Well, of course.

12:34.257 --> 12:37.590
If you hadn't been so intent
on earning a few extra dollars...

12:37.627 --> 12:40.391
You ought to try running
your own business, Higgins.

12:40.430 --> 12:43.922
I have. It was Geneva, 1957.
The Arlington Arms.

12:43.967 --> 12:46.561
It was a quiet hotel, nothing ostentatious,

12:46.603 --> 12:49.834
yet we catered to Europe's
most discriminating clientele,

12:49.873 --> 12:52.068
dukes, earls and occasional viscounts.

12:52.108 --> 12:55.100
You, turn around.
Come on, we're taking a walk.

12:55.145 --> 12:57.306
- I beg your pardon?
- Come on.

12:58.515 --> 13:00.039
Hey.

13:00.083 --> 13:02.313
Hey, wait a minute. Hey, what did he do?

13:02.352 --> 13:05.913
Nothing. We're only taking one of you.

13:05.956 --> 13:09.084
Killing me will only
exacerbate your culpability.

13:09.125 --> 13:12.583
Not only that,
you're gonna have to shoot me too.

13:12.629 --> 13:16.121
- That's very decent of you, T.C.
- Shut up, Higgins.

13:16.166 --> 13:17.997
You're not gonna shoot just him.

13:19.302 --> 13:22.066
Hey, if that's the way you feel about it.

13:22.105 --> 13:24.130
- Knock it off.
- One hostage is plenty.

13:26.443 --> 13:29.935
Be logical. We've got
a good five hours' walk ahead of us.

13:29.980 --> 13:34.383
We shoot one of them, the other knows
he's dead too, then he's no good to us.

13:34.417 --> 13:37.079
So we take 'em both. You got that?

13:40.323 --> 13:42.314
Good.

13:42.359 --> 13:45.920
All right, get everything we need.
Let's move out. Break his camera.

14:10.220 --> 14:13.053
- Why didn't you use your pick?
- T.C. pick-proofed it.

14:13.089 --> 14:16.217
- Why?
- Remember those Hungarian acrobats?

14:16.259 --> 14:19.387
Yeah. I tell you, Thomas, this is different.

14:19.429 --> 14:23.832
The hijacker didn't exactly leave
his driver's license and social security card.

14:23.867 --> 14:25.357
They had to leave a name.

14:25.402 --> 14:27.199
Probably an alias.

14:27.237 --> 14:29.933
Guys in this business tend
to stick to the same one.

14:29.973 --> 14:33.739
- Maybe you can get somewhere with it.
- I don't know those people any more.

14:34.344 --> 14:36.869
Maybe you should get reacquainted.

14:43.086 --> 14:46.214
Look at this mess. Nothing's in order.

14:46.790 --> 14:48.883
It's all a jumble, names, dates...

14:48.925 --> 14:53.021
How does he do business?
How does he know who his customers are?

14:54.331 --> 14:55.559
Whoa.

14:57.000 --> 14:58.991
What is it?

14:59.035 --> 15:00.935
Spangled tights.

15:02.405 --> 15:04.396
Come on, Rick. Keep looking.

15:10.413 --> 15:13.007
Nothing with today's date.

15:13.049 --> 15:15.040
Nothing's alphabetized.

15:16.219 --> 15:18.619
- This is a wild-goose chase.
- Aha.

15:24.394 --> 15:26.419
How did you find it?

15:26.463 --> 15:29.364
Simple. You've just got to know
how T.C.'s mind works.

15:29.399 --> 15:30.957
It was under P for paying.

15:31.001 --> 15:35.404
It's two guys, Blair Melvin
and Vic Barth, from Kansas...

15:36.306 --> 15:38.467
Higgins was going up at the same time.

15:39.542 --> 15:43.376
- Double tipping, that's how his mind works.
- Come on.

15:59.195 --> 16:01.163
Hold it, Magnum.

16:02.732 --> 16:05.860
Breaking and entering is a serious offence

16:05.902 --> 16:07.836
and so is stealing evidence.

16:07.871 --> 16:10.704
That's really compounding it.

16:10.740 --> 16:12.901
Hi, Lieutenant. Hi, guys.

16:12.942 --> 16:16.605
Hi, Magnum. I guess great minds think alike.

16:16.646 --> 16:21.174
I bet that's a rental contract with
a couple of real cute monikers.

16:21.217 --> 16:23.515
Here, let me have it.

16:24.421 --> 16:26.252
I'll run this through the computer.

16:26.289 --> 16:29.087
Maybe establish a link
with the guy they broke out.

16:29.125 --> 16:30.490
Who was he?

16:30.527 --> 16:34.019
We think a paperhanger
named Eugene Goorwitz.

16:34.064 --> 16:38.467
It hasn't been verified yet. They're trying
to lock down the last two cellblocks.

16:38.501 --> 16:40.662
What about T.C.? Any sign of his chopper?

16:40.703 --> 16:44.002
Nothing. We lost radio contact
half-way to Molokai.

16:44.040 --> 16:48.272
But if it comes ashore, we'll find them.
Otherwise the coastguard will.

16:48.311 --> 16:50.176
What are we supposed to do?

16:51.147 --> 16:54.981
Hey, come on, guys,
we've already been through the place.

16:55.018 --> 16:58.010
Thank you for the extra fingerprints.

16:58.054 --> 17:01.285
Just don't do me any more favors. Go home.

17:01.324 --> 17:04.452
- Lieutenant!
- Magnum, you stay in the bullpen.

17:04.493 --> 17:06.155
Right now, I am on the mound.

17:15.204 --> 17:18.333
I can remember it
as if it were only yesterday.

17:18.374 --> 17:20.842
The Burmese death march.

17:20.877 --> 17:25.280
Our brave lads were dropping like flies
and so were our captors.

17:26.148 --> 17:30.552
The oppressive heat sapping every ounce
of moisture from our bodies.

17:30.587 --> 17:32.578
Shut up.

17:35.391 --> 17:39.657
I would recommend removing those loafers
and going without.

17:39.696 --> 17:44.565
But then, of course, you'd be vulnerable
to the snakes and tarantulas.

17:44.601 --> 17:45.966
One more word...

17:46.002 --> 17:47.993
Come on, we're off our timetable.

17:48.037 --> 17:51.700
- Too bad you didn't think of that earlier.
- Just keep walking, T.C.

17:51.741 --> 17:53.800
"Just keep walking, T.C."

17:53.843 --> 17:56.505
"Fly me here, T.C. Fly me there."

17:56.546 --> 17:58.537
Where are we going now, Mister?

17:58.581 --> 18:01.049
To the clearing
you were supposed to land in.

18:01.084 --> 18:03.075
Yeah? Then what?

18:03.119 --> 18:06.247
Then we get what we come for
and we leave by boat.

18:06.289 --> 18:09.622
Don't worry.
You guys will be staying right here.

18:09.659 --> 18:11.149
Yeah, dead.

18:11.194 --> 18:13.389
The thought has entered my mind.

18:13.429 --> 18:17.525
I knew it. They're gonna kill us.
We've got to figure out some way...

18:17.567 --> 18:18.829
Come on.

18:19.869 --> 18:21.302
Leave him alone.

18:23.506 --> 18:26.066
The sooner we get out
of this place, the better.

18:26.109 --> 18:29.408
Look, don't make it tougher on yourself, OK?

18:29.445 --> 18:31.606
Yeah, thanks.

18:56.639 --> 18:58.004
Sit.

18:59.042 --> 19:01.636
Listen, thanks for seeing me, Ice Pick.

19:01.678 --> 19:05.011
Always a pleasure seeing some old friends.

19:05.048 --> 19:07.346
Hot enough for you yet?

19:07.383 --> 19:09.317
It's fine. Fine, Ice Pick.

19:10.086 --> 19:12.850
Steam's good for you, opens the pores.

19:13.856 --> 19:16.848
You will live to be 102, you know?

19:16.893 --> 19:18.827
Maybe.

19:23.499 --> 19:26.024
Listen, um... I need a favor.

19:26.069 --> 19:29.903
- My sister has her hearing on the 12th.
- I'd like you to run down a couple...

19:29.939 --> 19:34.137
I'd sure hate to see her take a fall
for something awful like this.

19:34.177 --> 19:37.874
She's a good kid.
You know my sister, don't you?

19:37.914 --> 19:41.042
Sure, sure.
She's quite a girl, quite a girl, Sheila.

19:41.084 --> 19:42.949
Dolores.

19:43.686 --> 19:45.347
Dolores.

19:47.724 --> 19:49.715
I'll make it hotter.

19:51.861 --> 19:54.523
- You'll like it.
- Yeah, thanks.

19:58.434 --> 20:02.837
You know, one of your employees
is testifying at the grand jury.

20:02.872 --> 20:03.964
Who?

20:04.007 --> 20:05.406
Keoki.

20:05.441 --> 20:07.432
Keoki? You're kidding.

20:08.511 --> 20:10.809
I want you to talk to him, Rick.

20:10.847 --> 20:15.147
Make him understand
what a wonderful person my sister is.

20:16.319 --> 20:17.980
Sure, Ice Pick.

20:20.857 --> 20:24.850
You know, Rick,
we should do this more often.

20:35.271 --> 20:39.002
Now you can give me
those two names you need.

20:40.910 --> 20:43.435
We got to do something.
I agree.

20:43.479 --> 20:44.468
I got a plan.

20:44.514 --> 20:48.917
Since one of your schemes got us into
this predicament, I suggest we ignore it.

20:48.951 --> 20:52.079
- I have a plan.
- Another one of your oldies but goodies?

20:52.121 --> 20:54.715
Suez, actually, 1956.

20:54.757 --> 20:58.056
The Egyptians had us
completely surrounded.

21:03.433 --> 21:04.593
Hey, look.

21:15.878 --> 21:18.403
Hey, what about us?

21:18.448 --> 21:21.042
- Go ahead.
- T.C., I wouldn't go near that pond.

21:21.084 --> 21:23.075
- Why?
- The Peridasteaus fly.

21:23.119 --> 21:25.713
- They're indigenous to these islands.
- So?

21:25.755 --> 21:30.215
The mortality rate from drinking water infected
by the female of the species is high.

21:30.259 --> 21:33.023
94.7%%%, if I recall correctly.

21:38.468 --> 21:41.596
Yes. Oh, my.

21:46.676 --> 21:49.474
<i>They are in the water.
Where else could they be?</i>

21:49.512 --> 21:52.538
They were at the Molokai Channel
when radar lost contact.

21:52.582 --> 21:54.880
The news said
they took hits over the prison.

21:54.917 --> 21:59.718
- What's the fuel capacity of the 500-D?
- Hmm... 56 gallons.

21:59.756 --> 22:02.281
Let's see.

22:02.325 --> 22:06.523
If they change course, flew under
the radar, they could be anywhere...

22:06.562 --> 22:11.261
Within 200 miles circumference
of any point where the radar lost contact.

22:12.268 --> 22:16.102
Hell, Thomas, there's a lot
of uninhabited rock out here.

22:19.909 --> 22:21.570
Hello.

22:21.611 --> 22:24.079
Yeah. It's for you.

22:24.113 --> 22:26.581
- Who is it?
- It's Ice Pick.

22:27.417 --> 22:28.907
Thanks.

22:30.186 --> 22:31.676
Yo.

22:32.688 --> 22:34.349
Yeah?

22:35.358 --> 22:37.826
That's great. That's great. I owe you one.

22:38.761 --> 22:43.664
No, no, don't worry.
Your sister will beat the rap. I guarantee it.

22:43.699 --> 22:46.725
I got the ID on the guys
that took the chopper.

22:48.337 --> 22:51.636
- Mainland beef, strictly muscle.
- You sure?

22:53.242 --> 22:54.834
Ice Pick is never wrong.

23:00.950 --> 23:06.013
What's a small-time,
white-collar criminal like Goorwitz

23:06.055 --> 23:08.523
doing hiring mainland hoods
to bust him out?

23:08.558 --> 23:12.654
Who cares? I just want to know
where those creeps took T.C. and Higgins.

23:31.113 --> 23:33.377
It's all downhill from here.

23:35.051 --> 23:37.042
Through jungle, though.

23:37.086 --> 23:39.384
I said it's not far.

23:39.422 --> 23:41.413
Yeah, you said that an hour ago.

23:42.258 --> 23:45.250
You guys want to stay here, I'm amenable.

23:45.294 --> 23:49.697
You don't see T.C. and the sergeant major
complaining. They have nothing to gain.

23:49.732 --> 23:51.563
Well, almost nothing.

24:05.314 --> 24:07.305
Come on, Higgins.

24:11.954 --> 24:14.980
- Want to try your Suez plan now?
- We never implemented it.

24:15.024 --> 24:17.618
- What?
- We were replaced by Egyptian troops...

24:17.660 --> 24:21.152
I just don't want to hear it.
I told you to stop smoking.

24:21.197 --> 24:23.927
- Save yourself, man.
- Higgins, come on.

24:37.513 --> 24:39.174
Uh!

25:04.772 --> 25:08.868
<i>Maybe Ice Pick was never wrong
but he didn't have all the answers either</i>

25:08.910 --> 25:13.244
<i>and I was hoping maybe Tanaka did,
or at least some of them.</i>

25:13.281 --> 25:17.741
<i>On the way there, I was thinking about
the last time I saw T.C. and Higgins.</i>

25:17.785 --> 25:21.277
<i>They were ganging up on me about
gas money and the wine cellar.</i>

25:21.322 --> 25:26.021
<i>I kind of missed it. Well, at least there
was one comforting thought about this.</i>

25:26.060 --> 25:29.052
<i>T.C. and Higgins had each other
to keep themselves going.</i>

25:29.864 --> 25:32.765
Don't touch me, man.
Keep moving, T.C.

25:32.800 --> 25:36.634
- Lyden should have finished you off too.
- Just keep walking, chin up.

25:36.671 --> 25:38.969
My chin's all right. My shoulder's shot.

25:39.007 --> 25:42.135
- That bandage requires changing.
- I'm all right.

25:42.176 --> 25:44.838
I admire your courage
but excessive blood loss...

25:44.879 --> 25:47.177
I've said I'm all right. Suez.

25:47.215 --> 25:48.705
Come on!

25:48.750 --> 25:50.741
- Watch it.
- It wasn't his fault.

25:50.785 --> 25:53.345
- You want a slug in your back too?
- Knock it off.

25:53.388 --> 25:57.484
- We'll never get there dragging him.
- Get it through your head, he's coming.

25:57.525 --> 25:59.186
All the way to the clearing.

25:59.227 --> 26:01.218
- We got the limey.
- Uh-huh.

26:01.262 --> 26:03.287
The one you wanted to blow away.

26:09.470 --> 26:13.304
Don't even think of it.
I know where the stuff is and you don't.

26:13.341 --> 26:17.277
I also know where the boat is hidden. Right?

26:23.551 --> 26:25.542
Excellent. Now, let's move.

26:25.586 --> 26:28.054
After I change his bandage.

26:28.089 --> 26:31.081
Do not press your luck, Sergeant Major.

26:31.125 --> 26:33.218
Move!

26:34.295 --> 26:37.128
Funny the way he knew
my name and your rank.

26:37.165 --> 26:38.826
Yes.

26:38.866 --> 26:42.529
Sorry, Magnum, nothing.
It's only been a couple of hours.

26:42.570 --> 26:46.666
There's a lot of water out there,
just give us more time. We'll find him.

26:46.707 --> 26:50.143
Look, Rick got a possible ID
on the two hijackers. Mainland...

26:50.178 --> 26:54.012
Muscle, yeah. Jack Curry and Floyd Bryce.

26:54.048 --> 26:57.176
The computer kicked
their names out a couple of hours ago.

26:57.218 --> 26:59.379
Any previous connection to Goorwitz?

26:59.420 --> 27:01.388
Not that we know of.

27:02.256 --> 27:06.352
Listen, Lieutenant,
this just doesn't make sense.

27:06.394 --> 27:09.522
Goorwitz only had six months left
to serve on his sentence.

27:09.564 --> 27:12.863
Why hire mainland hoods to bust him out
and in such a risky way?

27:12.900 --> 27:16.028
You never know what
a man in prison's going to do.

27:16.070 --> 27:19.562
Might have made some enemies,
been on somebody's hit list.

27:19.607 --> 27:23.703
A dozen reasons. You want
to go to the Islander game on Friday?

27:23.744 --> 27:25.905
Got a couple of extra tickets.

27:25.947 --> 27:29.110
Sure, if Higgins and T.C. can go.

27:29.150 --> 27:31.516
I'm trying, Magnum, I'm trying.

27:33.020 --> 27:34.647
I know you are.

27:35.690 --> 27:36.748
Oh.

27:36.791 --> 27:41.626
I've been meaning to ask you, that crash,
you ever ID the guy in the sedan?

27:41.662 --> 27:45.063
Yeah, it was some tourist guy from France.

27:45.099 --> 27:49.195
Raymond LeFevre or LeFever,
something like that.

27:55.343 --> 28:00.406
<i>One name and suddenly I knew why
a paperhanger with only six months to serve</i>

28:00.448 --> 28:03.576
<i>busted out of Halawa Prison
in T.C.'s chopper,</i>

28:03.618 --> 28:06.143
<i>only I couldn't tell Tanaka</i>.

28:06.187 --> 28:10.180
<i>If I did, it was liable to get
T.C. and Higgins killed.</i>

28:10.224 --> 28:14.923
<i>All I had to do to be sure
was to visit one inmate at Halawa Prison.</i>

28:19.000 --> 28:21.833
We just got the last of them in lockdown.

28:21.869 --> 28:24.531
When Goorwitz lifted
out of here in that chopper,

28:24.572 --> 28:26.563
he left a full-scale riot in his wake.

28:26.607 --> 28:29.132
- It wasn't Goorwitz.
- So you told me.

28:42.356 --> 28:44.347
Lyden, step forward.

28:44.392 --> 28:46.053
Lyden.

28:59.707 --> 29:03.040
- That's not Lyden.
- How the hell did you know?

29:03.077 --> 29:05.910
- Just a hunch.
- You got any more?

29:05.947 --> 29:08.006
Like where he might be?

29:08.049 --> 29:12.145
Right there. Lyden was running guns
to guerrilla groups in South America.

29:12.186 --> 29:15.553
- He was using this island as an HQ.
- What's the connection to you?

29:15.590 --> 29:19.686
I was Lyden's second-in-command.
Naval Intelligence had me in deep cover.

29:19.727 --> 29:22.924
The only one who got away
was Ray LeFevre.

29:22.964 --> 29:25.728
- The guy in the car.
- He had to be coming from Lyden.

29:25.766 --> 29:29.224
- That was eight hours ago.
- Can you get the King Kamehameha ll?

29:29.270 --> 29:31.204
We're going out there, just you and I?

29:31.239 --> 29:35.198
- We wouldn't want to outnumber them.
- No, why do it the easy way?

29:47.455 --> 29:49.446
Let's move in.

29:49.490 --> 29:54.018
- I want to check it out first.
- I think I want to check it out with you.

29:54.929 --> 29:58.729
Suit yourself. Tie up the sergeant major.
We'll be right back.

29:59.700 --> 30:02.032
Give your gun to Floyd.

30:04.272 --> 30:05.933
Come on.

30:11.245 --> 30:13.236
Put your hands behind you.

30:15.983 --> 30:19.146
You can at least have
the decency not to tie his hands.

30:19.186 --> 30:21.347
He's almost unconscious now.

30:22.890 --> 30:27.293
Private Matlock, I served with briefly
in North Africa, had a similar wound.

30:27.328 --> 30:30.661
Had to walk through the desert
back to our lines.

30:30.698 --> 30:33.223
I had to write the letter to his family.

30:34.035 --> 30:36.333
You ain't gonna write my folks.

30:37.071 --> 30:39.039
They'd never forgive me.

30:49.116 --> 30:51.107
- What's that?
- Bats.

30:52.119 --> 30:55.384
Be careful. Don't make any sudden moves.

30:55.423 --> 30:57.414
I ain't scared of animals.

30:57.458 --> 30:59.449
I'm talking about the ammo wells.

30:59.493 --> 31:02.189
They're dug into this place 30 feet deep.

31:04.699 --> 31:07.224
Where are the guns?

31:07.268 --> 31:09.202
In there.

31:16.010 --> 31:18.001
Just one crate?

31:18.045 --> 31:20.036
That's all I need.

31:21.282 --> 31:23.273
What's going on here?

31:24.385 --> 31:27.513
LeFevre said we had eight cases of M-16s.

31:28.456 --> 31:29.946
We had a deal.

31:31.125 --> 31:33.423
I was hoping you wouldn't take it this way.

31:33.461 --> 31:35.895
You scammed us!

31:35.930 --> 31:40.765
Would you have broken me out of prison
if I'd told you the truth?

31:45.639 --> 31:47.937
There's only two possibilities.

31:47.975 --> 31:50.967
He killed your friend or your friend killed him.

31:51.011 --> 31:53.002
I've been expecting it.

31:53.047 --> 31:55.515
Saw the same thing happen in Singapore.

32:07.194 --> 32:09.025
Jack.

32:12.166 --> 32:13.827
Jack.

32:15.102 --> 32:16.763
Hey, Jack.

32:34.021 --> 32:37.513
- Time to go.
- I insist you let me change his bandage.

32:37.558 --> 32:39.821
I'll do even better than that.

32:39.894 --> 32:42.192
I'm going to give you gentlemen some sun.

32:42.229 --> 32:44.697
You know, on the beach. T.C.

32:45.633 --> 32:47.601
Agh!

32:47.635 --> 32:49.626
You killed them, didn't you?

32:51.605 --> 32:53.596
Of course, Sergeant Major.

33:00.448 --> 33:03.940
<i>There was an unspoken question
on Rick's face as we pulled out to sea</i>

33:03.984 --> 33:05.918
<i>and I guess it was on mine too</i>.

33:05.953 --> 33:10.049
<i>What if I was wrong? Wrong about Lyden?
Wrong about the whole thing?</i>

33:10.090 --> 33:11.785
<i>We'd be taking a cruise to nowhere</i>

33:11.826 --> 33:14.954
<i>while T.C. and Higgins were
waiting someplace else for me,</i>

33:14.995 --> 33:16.553
<i>counting on me to get them out</i>.

33:16.597 --> 33:21.864
<i>We left the question unspoken. I don't think
either one of us wanted to answer it.</i>

33:51.031 --> 33:55.127
You know, you remind me
of a Major Hawley I met in the Congo once.

33:55.169 --> 33:59.265
I was interrogating him under the auspices
of the UN peacekeeping force.

33:59.306 --> 34:02.298
The man was a lot like you,
a cold-blooded killer.

34:02.343 --> 34:04.334
I know. I've worked with him.

34:04.378 --> 34:06.369
Now, sit down.

34:10.083 --> 34:11.949
Here we are, gentlemen.

34:11.985 --> 34:15.114
Now, I want you to be sure
and enjoy yourselves out here.

34:16.123 --> 34:18.284
You can catch a little sun.

34:18.324 --> 34:20.156
You can play in the sand.

34:20.960 --> 34:24.293
Anything you like but, Sergeant Major,

34:24.331 --> 34:27.494
you be sure and say hi
to Magnum for me, won't you?

34:27.534 --> 34:29.628
What makes you so sure he's coming?

34:29.670 --> 34:31.831
I left him a message.

34:31.871 --> 34:36.571
If he doesn't return it in say, one hour,
you gentlemen are dead.

34:49.924 --> 34:51.482
T.C.?

34:52.393 --> 34:54.054
- T.C.
- What! Uh...

34:55.429 --> 34:57.192
What's happening now?

34:57.231 --> 34:59.665
Apparently we're waiting for Magnum.

35:01.335 --> 35:03.803
I knew it.

35:03.837 --> 35:07.933
Every time my chopper
gets bullet holes in it, he's involved.

35:11.645 --> 35:13.476
Higgins...

35:13.514 --> 35:15.311
I feel cold.

36:08.433 --> 36:11.334
- It ain't gonna work.
- You got any better ideas?

36:11.370 --> 36:13.531
He's going to know I'm not this LeFevre guy.

36:13.572 --> 36:16.336
Not from a distance.
You're about the same height.

36:16.375 --> 36:18.843
You just wave and get out of sight.

36:18.877 --> 36:22.540
- What if he's got binoculars?
- How much longer?

36:23.348 --> 36:26.181
Keep your foot to the floor,
Be there in 40 minutes.

36:26.218 --> 36:28.209
30 minutes...

36:29.788 --> 36:31.688
Then I'm leaving.

36:31.723 --> 36:33.623
Alone.

36:34.960 --> 36:39.590
Evidently, Magnum doesn't think
much of you two. I was wrong.

36:39.631 --> 36:43.624
Magnum's many things
but he certainly isn't stupid,

36:43.669 --> 36:45.500
or suicidal.

36:47.272 --> 36:49.263
Tell me, I'm curious.

36:50.242 --> 36:53.234
Your plan is so well orchestrated.

36:53.278 --> 36:57.237
Only one thing, why would Magnum come?

36:59.418 --> 37:02.910
Because he values the life of his friends
more than his own.

37:02.954 --> 37:05.422
An archaic concept in today's world.

37:05.457 --> 37:07.925
- But one you understand.
- Perhaps.

37:07.959 --> 37:11.087
But I don't understand why you're doing this.

37:13.765 --> 37:15.756
Thomas Magnum broke a code.

37:17.569 --> 37:19.560
A soldier's code.

37:20.906 --> 37:22.271
Your code.

37:22.307 --> 37:25.606
You're no more a soldier
than those two thugs you killed.

37:25.644 --> 37:29.307
Whatever your code is, it's not mine,

37:29.347 --> 37:31.474
nor, I suspect, Magnum's.

37:33.118 --> 37:36.144
Sergeant Major, you have 30 minutes.

37:36.188 --> 37:38.622
I don't think T.C. does.

37:50.936 --> 37:54.895
You go in, swim underwater
and you sneak around their flank.

37:54.940 --> 37:57.932
Are you crazy?
I'm no good at swimming underwater.

37:57.976 --> 38:01.935
- Anybody can swim underwater.
- Anybody can drown, too.

38:01.980 --> 38:05.472
If I don't drown, what do I do?

38:06.418 --> 38:08.886
You circle around and then you take him out.

38:08.920 --> 38:12.412
Take him out, yeah, right,
while you're gonna walk right up his nose.

38:12.457 --> 38:16.120
- Thomas, he's gonna shoot you.
- Lyden's not gonna shoot me.

38:16.161 --> 38:18.152
At least not from a distance.

38:19.765 --> 38:23.861
He could have hired anybody to do that.
He wants the personal satisfaction.

38:23.902 --> 38:25.733
I hope you're right.

38:25.771 --> 38:29.263
<i>The plan was not exactly
Napoleonic in its brilliance</i>

38:29.307 --> 38:31.775
<i>but it was the only thing I could think of</i>.

38:31.810 --> 38:34.574
<i>Telling the police meant
a SWAT team coming in</i>

38:34.613 --> 38:37.480
<i>like the first eight bars of Tiger Rag</i>

38:37.516 --> 38:40.883
<i>and that would only get
T.C. and Higgins shot up.</i>

38:40.919 --> 38:44.753
<i>I was hoping Lyden hadn't changed much
in the last three years.</i>

38:44.790 --> 38:47.384
<i>Of course, if he had</i>...

38:48.960 --> 38:52.088
Yes, New Guinea, '51.

38:52.864 --> 38:55.332
Or was it '52?

38:55.367 --> 38:57.665
No matter.

38:57.702 --> 39:01.365
Lieutenant Hilton-Thorpe
had vanished from the compound.

39:01.406 --> 39:03.397
We searched for days.

39:03.441 --> 39:07.275
Finally we found him lying on the beach
tied to four stakes.

39:07.312 --> 39:10.679
It seemed he'd angered
the father of one of the native girls,

39:10.715 --> 39:15.118
a mistake a green second lieutenant
from Cambridge is wont to make.

39:15.153 --> 39:18.884
Anyway, the irate father had slit
poor Hilton-Thorpe's eyelids

39:18.924 --> 39:21.222
and covered his body with honey.

39:21.259 --> 39:23.853
Fortunately, we arrived in the nick of time.

39:23.895 --> 39:27.558
Of course Hilton-Thorpe had to wear
sunglasses for the rest of his life,

39:27.599 --> 39:31.763
not to mention the intense dislike
for sweets he acquired.

39:31.803 --> 39:33.361
I say, T.C.,

39:33.405 --> 39:35.305
are you listening?

39:41.947 --> 39:43.778
Ten minutes!

39:44.950 --> 39:46.611
Hang in there, T.C.

39:55.794 --> 39:58.092
Well, how do I look?

40:00.398 --> 40:02.389
Like Louis Jordan.

40:03.835 --> 40:05.826
Get ready.

40:36.601 --> 40:38.592
Send him in!

40:46.278 --> 40:49.770
- What if Lyden sees me?
- He can't see you on this side.

40:52.918 --> 40:54.749
Break a leg.

41:33.558 --> 41:35.389
Magnum's here.

41:36.294 --> 41:38.592
Whatever he wants, tell him no.

41:47.572 --> 41:51.975
That wouldn't be sporting, would it?
Not after all this trouble you went to.

42:05.357 --> 42:08.383
- What's the matter with T.C.?
- He's been shot.

42:08.426 --> 42:10.087
He's bleeding to death.

42:10.128 --> 42:11.925
My God, what kept you?

42:11.963 --> 42:15.399
Sorry I was late, Higgins.
I had to figure this out for myself.

42:15.433 --> 42:20.496
I must say, your propensity for alienating
people never ceases to amaze me.

42:20.538 --> 42:22.165
What did you do to him?

42:22.974 --> 42:23.998
Magnum!

42:25.176 --> 42:27.167
- How many?
- Just him.

42:31.750 --> 42:34.218
We're gonna make it.

42:50.769 --> 42:52.134
Drop the weapon.

42:58.910 --> 43:00.901
And the surprise.

43:13.691 --> 43:15.989
In five minutes, they'd have been dead.

43:16.027 --> 43:17.688
Ray was late.

43:17.729 --> 43:20.425
- You're lying.
- Ask him.

43:20.999 --> 43:23.661
You're lying to me
just like you did three years ago.

43:39.918 --> 43:41.909
Far enough.

43:43.188 --> 43:45.179
This time you're alone.

43:45.957 --> 43:49.085
Three years ago
you came with a squad of SPs.

43:49.127 --> 43:52.790
- Three years ago I was under orders.
- Mine!

43:52.831 --> 43:57.894
- The Navy's.
- Because of that, 300 men got wiped out.

43:57.936 --> 43:59.927
Good men.

43:59.971 --> 44:02.269
They were waiting for their weapons.

44:02.307 --> 44:06.266
They were waiting for me.
You remember that, Magnum?

44:06.311 --> 44:09.803
Yeah, I remember them.
I remember they were hired mercenaries.

44:09.848 --> 44:12.976
The only good thing about them
was they had the bucks.

44:13.017 --> 44:15.713
You remember the guys before them, Lyden?

44:15.753 --> 44:18.221
They didn't have the bucks.

44:18.256 --> 44:21.953
They got wiped out cos they were
fighting AK-47 s with spears.

44:21.993 --> 44:26.089
They couldn't afford you, Lyden.
They were waiting too.

44:26.131 --> 44:27.962
That's not true.

44:27.999 --> 44:29.728
Oh, yeah,

44:29.767 --> 44:31.496
they were.

44:33.104 --> 44:37.507
All the killing in this world,
all the deaths and you feed on it.

44:37.542 --> 44:40.477
Do what you got to do,
just spare me the rhetoric.

44:47.719 --> 44:49.880
Oh! Ohhh!

44:58.062 --> 45:00.360
Haaah!

45:50.114 --> 45:51.604
Save your energy.

45:58.790 --> 46:00.280
Thomas!

46:00.325 --> 46:03.123
- Thomas!
- Rick!

46:11.936 --> 46:14.530
Hi, Rick, what are you doing down there?

46:39.764 --> 46:44.463
<i>Friendship is a fragile thing,
precious and delicate,</i>

46:44.502 --> 46:49.701
<i>and it took something drastic and almost
irreversible to make us realize that.</i>

46:49.741 --> 46:52.869
<i>We were all lucky. We got another chance</i>.

46:52.910 --> 46:55.003
<i>I knew the guys had to feel good about it</i>.

46:55.046 --> 46:56.911
You're gonna owe me for this one, boy.

46:56.948 --> 46:59.246
I'll have to barge my machine all the way back.

46:59.284 --> 47:01.752
- Do you know how much that's gonna cost?
- T.C.!

47:01.786 --> 47:05.119
Besides, listening to Higgins all the time
just about killed me.

47:05.156 --> 47:08.387
Killed you? I was attempting
to keep you from going into a coma.

47:08.426 --> 47:09.450
Hah!

47:09.494 --> 47:12.827
You couldn't hear me consciously,
but your subconscious could.

47:12.864 --> 47:15.355
I was saving your life
by keeping you involved.

47:15.400 --> 47:17.095
Telling me about peeled eyelids?

47:17.135 --> 47:19.126
See? You remembered.

47:21.205 --> 47:24.697
That notwithstanding, you're responsible
for two broken cameras

47:24.742 --> 47:26.903
- for which you will pay dearly.
- Higgins.

47:26.944 --> 47:30.277
And I gotta see an orthopedist
and a chiropractor regularly.

47:30.315 --> 47:31.339
Come on, Rick!

47:31.382 --> 47:34.374
You didn't say nothing about
no 30-feet-deep ammo wells.

47:34.419 --> 47:36.580
"Just go round the back and take him out."

47:36.621 --> 47:39.089
It's pretty expensive knowing you.

47:39.123 --> 47:42.957
Quite. You remind me
of a chap I once served with in the Sudan.

47:42.994 --> 47:47.658
Binky Sliverton. Binky had
the most disgusting way of using people,

47:47.699 --> 47:51.430
like the time Binky brought us all
a gift of freshly-killed chickens.

47:51.469 --> 47:55.303
We found ourselves
surrounded by 300 furious Sudanese.

47:55.340 --> 48:00.107
It seems that Binky had wandered into
the hut of one of the local witch doctors...
