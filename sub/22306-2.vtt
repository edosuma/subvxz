WEBVTT

00:01.234 --> 00:01.434
.

00:10.844 --> 00:12.045
'...a bit.'

00:12.045 --> 00:14.547
'I'm Jimmy Carr
and welcome to Drunk History,

00:14.547 --> 00:17.317
the show that brings you
stories from history...'

00:17.317 --> 00:19.152
The whole of our city's on fire!

00:19.152 --> 00:22.155
This isn't a fire.
A woman could piss it out.

00:22.155 --> 00:24.424
'...as told by
blind drunk comedians.'

00:24.424 --> 00:25.892
Keep it together.

00:25.892 --> 00:27.961
'Sharing stories from centuries ago

00:27.961 --> 00:30.363
but not remembering them
in the morning.'

00:30.363 --> 00:32.064
I'm milking the cows, in't I?

00:32.064 --> 00:34.334
'Prepare to binge on booze
and history.'

00:34.334 --> 00:37.370
What?!
'But mainly booze.'

00:37.370 --> 00:40.407
I'm a massive drunken liar.
(laughs)

00:40.407 --> 00:42.809
(laughs)
Funny!

00:42.809 --> 00:46.346
That is funny, man! (laughs)

00:56.589 --> 01:00.193
'We start tonight with a story
about how a tiny mistake in a bakery

01:00.193 --> 01:02.562
ended up burning down
the whole of London.'

01:02.562 --> 01:04.831
'Best Bake Off episode ever.'

01:05.832 --> 01:08.001
'Tom Rosenthal drank three pints

01:08.001 --> 01:10.303
and the best part
of a bottle of whisky

01:10.303 --> 01:13.506
before trying his damnedest
to remember what happened.'

01:13.506 --> 01:15.442
(hiccups)

01:15.442 --> 01:19.546
I'll tell you about one of the
greatest disasters in British history

01:19.546 --> 01:23.149
that could have been prevented
if one man just did his job.

01:23.149 --> 01:26.152
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is the Great Fire of London.

01:27.954 --> 01:30.790
Er... 2nd September.

01:32.192 --> 01:35.295
A baker called Thomas Farriner
went to bed.

01:35.295 --> 01:38.865
They all said the oven was off,
it ain't off.

01:38.865 --> 01:40.133
(laughs)

01:40.133 --> 01:43.136
The oven is... is fucking on.

01:43.136 --> 01:47.841
And, erm, a fire starts
cos they'd left the oven on, right?

01:47.841 --> 01:50.810
His house burnt down, bam.
Bakery gone.

01:50.810 --> 01:55.949
All the houses next to him, bam.
Cos it was a hot September, windy.

01:55.949 --> 01:58.151
Pudding Lane, it's up.

01:58.151 --> 02:00.787
OK. And, er...

02:00.787 --> 02:04.023
I'll tell you what happens,
the mayor, Bloodworth,

02:04.023 --> 02:08.026
his little mate,
his little servant man, is like,

02:08.026 --> 02:11.131
"Oi, oi, Bloodworth,
sorry to wake you up and shit,

02:11.131 --> 02:14.534
but there's a fire...
there's quite a big fire going on

02:14.534 --> 02:16.970
in the city that
you're responsible for."

02:16.970 --> 02:20.206
Bloodworth was like,
"Mate, I don't give a shit."

02:20.206 --> 02:24.010
"It's my 46th birthday
and you're waking me up."

02:24.010 --> 02:26.412
"Is it a surprise birthday fire?"

02:26.412 --> 02:29.082
He's like,
"No, you gotta go down Pudding Lane,

02:29.082 --> 02:30.717
there's a fire kicking off."

02:30.717 --> 02:34.888
And Bloodworth's like,
"Oh, you're kidding me, man!"

02:34.888 --> 02:38.157
So, Bloodworth rocks down to the...
to Pudding Lane,

02:38.157 --> 02:42.128
and he's like, "This is bullshit!
I don't care about this."

02:42.128 --> 02:46.232
"This is a little, like, flicker.
This is like a candle to me."

02:46.232 --> 02:49.035
He says this immortal quote
to the firefighters,

02:49.035 --> 02:52.405
"This isn't a fire.
A woman could piss it out."

02:55.975 --> 02:57.343
He says that.

02:57.343 --> 03:01.147
Which I find offensive
cos, first off,

03:01.147 --> 03:05.118
it's underestimating the strength
of the Great Fire of London,

03:05.118 --> 03:07.287
but secondly, it's misogynistic.

03:07.287 --> 03:11.024
It suggests that a woman's piss
is less powerful than a man's piss.

03:11.024 --> 03:13.593
And ultimately, we all piss the same.

03:13.593 --> 03:16.296
The firefighters are like,
"This is serious."

03:16.296 --> 03:18.965
"London's gonna go up
if you don't do something."

03:18.965 --> 03:23.803
Bloodworth says to the firefighters,
"Just use your little pistols."

03:23.803 --> 03:25.438
"Use your little things."

03:25.438 --> 03:28.775
They're like, "Bloodworth,
you're a fucking idiot!"

03:28.775 --> 03:32.812
"These ain't gonna put the fire out."
He's like, "I don't give a shit."

03:32.812 --> 03:35.949
And the firefighters are like,
"We need a decision."

03:35.949 --> 03:38.518
"Shall we pull the houses down
around it?"

03:38.518 --> 03:40.186
"It will stop it spreading."

03:40.186 --> 03:43.323
He's like, "Fuck it,
I'm going back to bed."

03:45.925 --> 03:49.128
(laughs) So he goes back to bed!

03:50.363 --> 03:51.598
(laughs)

03:53.466 --> 03:55.401
This is weird.

03:55.401 --> 03:57.437
This is really weird.

03:57.437 --> 03:59.038
You're all just...

03:59.038 --> 04:01.374
You're just all accessories to this.

04:01.374 --> 04:02.775
You just...

04:02.775 --> 04:05.645
All this is basically illegal,
what you're doing.

04:05.645 --> 04:06.846
(laughs)

04:06.846 --> 04:09.949
You're just filming this.
(laughs)

04:09.949 --> 04:12.785
I'm like...
I'm like a monkey or something.

04:13.953 --> 04:16.755
OK, I'll stop.
That's the end of that take.

04:16.755 --> 04:19.559
Great take, guys. Great take.
Nailed it.

04:19.559 --> 04:22.428
(laughs)

04:24.130 --> 04:28.968
On the other side of London,
Samuel Pepys is keeping a diary.

04:28.968 --> 04:31.170
Now, cheeky little Pepy-hole,

04:31.170 --> 04:35.675
he is the chief secretary
to the Admiral of the Navy.

04:35.675 --> 04:39.212
(burps) And he is...
Sorry. Excuse me.

04:39.212 --> 04:42.548
He writes that he woke up
at about 3.00am.

04:42.548 --> 04:46.252
He has a littler gander and is like,
"Cheeky fire going on there."

04:46.252 --> 04:47.720
He's fine, he's like...

04:47.720 --> 04:50.923
Pepy-hole reckons
the fire ain't gonna touch him.

04:50.923 --> 04:54.827
So he just writes down in his diary
as like a little sub-note,

04:54.827 --> 04:59.832
"Yeah, cheeky fire.
There's a cheeky fire going on."

04:59.832 --> 05:03.202
Then he closes the diary,
goes back to bed, he can't be arsed.

05:05.238 --> 05:08.641
But then 7.00am, he wakes up.

05:08.641 --> 05:12.845
And he's like,
"Whoa, this fire's got balls."

05:12.845 --> 05:16.983
"This fire be kicking off, boy.
This is getting hot!"

05:16.983 --> 05:22.388
"And my city, LDN, is on fire!"

05:23.656 --> 05:26.759
So Pepy-hole, he then goes
and finds bloody Bloodworth.

05:26.759 --> 05:31.230
And he's like,
"Oi, Bloodworth, what's going on?"

05:31.230 --> 05:33.933
Bloodworth is like,
"It's my birthday."

05:33.933 --> 05:38.471
Pepy-hole is like,
"I don't care if it's your birthday,

05:38.471 --> 05:40.373
the whole of our city is on fire."

05:40.373 --> 05:45.011
And he's like, "So?
Are you gonna say 'happy birthday'?"

05:45.011 --> 05:48.815
And Pepy-hole is like,
"Oh, my... are you serious?"

05:48.815 --> 05:52.785
"Oh, for fu... Happy birthday."
"Thank you."

05:52.785 --> 05:55.488
So Pepy-hole says,
"We've got to sort this out."

05:55.488 --> 05:57.990
"You've got the authority
of King Charles II

05:57.990 --> 06:00.159
to pull down any houses you want."

06:00.159 --> 06:02.962
"That's the only way
we'll stop this fire."

06:02.962 --> 06:06.766
Bloodworth's like,
"Nah, I need a snooze."

06:06.766 --> 06:09.168
"This is too much pressure for me."

06:10.603 --> 06:14.674
Bloodworth is being ultimately
a massive douchebag.

06:14.674 --> 06:18.845
So Samuel Pepys is like,
"Well, I've got a dinner party."

06:18.845 --> 06:22.548
"I've got to go and make sure
the dinner party is going well."

06:22.548 --> 06:26.319
So he gets back to his house,
he starts showing off his house.

06:26.319 --> 06:29.388
He's like, "I've got my nice garms,

06:29.388 --> 06:32.892
got my nice beers,
I've got my nice wardrobe."

06:32.892 --> 06:35.795
And they're like, "Nice wardrobe."

06:35.795 --> 06:38.264
He's just doing a dinner party
for his mates.

06:38.264 --> 06:42.602
He's socialising being like,
"Look at us, we are so bohemian."

06:42.602 --> 06:44.904
"We are drinking
and enjoying our lives."

06:44.904 --> 06:49.475
And then everyone's like, "Pepy-hole,
the fire's getting really close."

06:49.475 --> 06:53.212
Pepy-hole's like, "Shit!"

06:53.212 --> 06:54.814
So he goes.

06:54.814 --> 06:59.118
He evacuates London in 1666

06:59.118 --> 07:02.789
because, let's face it,
it's all going up in flames.

07:02.789 --> 07:06.926
That's just Pepy-hole.
That's his vibe.

07:10.196 --> 07:13.633
So Bloodworth stayed in bed
because it's his birthday.

07:13.633 --> 07:18.070
Pepy-hole, he's done a runner.
London needs a hero.

07:18.070 --> 07:20.039
I'll tell you who it is.

07:20.039 --> 07:23.810
We're begging for it, we need it,
and someone steps up to the plate.

07:24.877 --> 07:28.481
It's the British monarch.
It's King Charles II.

07:31.050 --> 07:36.923
He comes to the British people
and he saves the bloody day.

07:38.958 --> 07:44.797
He said, "I'm King Charles II,
fire don't mean shit to me."

07:44.797 --> 07:46.999
"I'm the king of England!"

07:49.068 --> 07:52.004
And he rolls his sleeves up,
he's a proper monarch.

07:52.004 --> 07:53.806
He gets amongst the people.

07:53.806 --> 07:57.210
He puts his crown on,
he puts the fires out.

08:02.815 --> 08:05.718
He gives them gold coins
and silver coins

08:05.718 --> 08:08.955
to incentivise the firefighters,
he gives them bread.

08:10.456 --> 08:14.527
King Charles basically absolutely
kills it, knocks it out the park.

08:14.527 --> 08:18.798
Basically, establishes his name
as a hero of the British people.

08:18.798 --> 08:21.334
He saves them
from the Great Fire of London.

08:21.334 --> 08:25.872
Four and a half days after the first
flicker of the Great Fire of London

08:25.872 --> 08:28.774
in the ovens of Thomas Gainsborough,

08:28.774 --> 08:33.412
King Charles II extinguishes the last
embers of the Great Fire of London.

08:33.412 --> 08:35.748
1666, September 5th.

08:35.748 --> 08:38.951
King Charles II saves the day!

08:40.686 --> 08:43.389
'Well, Tom Rosenthal
has come to an end there.'

08:43.389 --> 08:46.626
'Our thoughts are with his family
at this difficult time.'

08:46.626 --> 08:51.163
'After the break, murder becomes
a lucrative business.'

08:51.163 --> 08:54.133
"Lord, has Christmas come early?"

08:58.304 --> 08:58.504
.

08:59.272 --> 09:01.107
'Welcome back to Drunk History.'

09:01.107 --> 09:04.243
'We hand-picked some of
Britain's best-loved comedians

09:04.243 --> 09:07.246
to slur their way through
half-remembered history

09:07.246 --> 09:08.814
for your entertainment.'

09:08.814 --> 09:11.484
"This isn't a fire.
A woman could piss it out."

09:14.487 --> 09:17.523
'Next up is the scary story
of Burke and Hare,

09:17.523 --> 09:20.993
two killers who stalked the streets
of Edinburgh in the 1800s.'

09:20.993 --> 09:23.796
'These days, the deadliest
double-act in Scotland

09:23.796 --> 09:26.399
is diabetes and heart disease.'

09:26.399 --> 09:28.534
'Andrew Maxwell
is telling this one.'

09:28.534 --> 09:31.771
'Or trying to after drinking
three bottles of champagne.'

09:31.771 --> 09:33.572
(laughs)

09:33.572 --> 09:37.276
I absolutely love champagne.
I love it.

09:37.276 --> 09:39.712
I love Guinness
and I love champagne.

09:39.712 --> 09:41.314
Makes you feel...
(cork pops)

09:43.849 --> 09:45.251
Let's talk about crime.

09:49.755 --> 09:53.893
I've sure as shit witnessed crime,
but I wouldn't get involved myself.

09:53.893 --> 09:56.963
It's for people that haven't
done well in their exams.

09:56.963 --> 10:00.766
(gulps)
Wow, this is a gassy number.

10:01.600 --> 10:04.070
We live in a world of medicine.

10:04.070 --> 10:08.040
In the 19th century, they were
just coming to terms with science.

10:08.040 --> 10:12.111
What's a willy, where's your tits?
That sort of thing, science.

10:12.111 --> 10:14.613
And they needed bodies to chop up.

10:14.613 --> 10:17.450
Now, two men, Burke and Hare.

10:17.450 --> 10:21.187
Got the same first name, William,
that'll become confusing in a bit.

10:21.187 --> 10:23.689
One of them,
he was a quite cunning man.

10:23.689 --> 10:27.360
The other one
had shot a horse in the face.

10:27.360 --> 10:31.464
Burke and Hare.
They turned up in Edinburgh.

10:31.464 --> 10:34.633
Hare's got a guesthouse.
Burke and his missus show up.

10:34.633 --> 10:38.004
"All right? I'm Willy Burke."
"I'm Willy Hare."

10:38.004 --> 10:41.440
"I shot a horse in the face."
That's how they meet.

10:41.440 --> 10:45.244
One night,
one of your hotel guests dies.

10:46.245 --> 10:49.248
Nobody collects him.
What are we gonna do with him?

10:49.248 --> 10:52.385
"Listen, we've got a situation here."

10:52.385 --> 10:56.088
"I've got a dead body in the house."

10:56.088 --> 10:58.424
"Still owes me four pound."

10:58.424 --> 11:02.161
The other Willy goes,
"Here, Willy, listen."

11:02.161 --> 11:06.165
"There's a fucking doctor who'll
take the body off us for nothing

11:06.165 --> 11:08.834
and his name's Johnny Knoxville."

11:08.834 --> 11:11.704
Dr John... John Knox.

11:11.704 --> 11:13.172
Doctor John Knox.

11:14.040 --> 11:16.242
(man) Dr Robert Knox.
Right.

11:16.242 --> 11:18.611
(laughter)

11:18.611 --> 11:20.312
So that's what they do.

11:20.312 --> 11:26.385
They contact the most
eminent surgeon, physician,

11:26.385 --> 11:28.354
in the whole of Edinburgh.

11:28.354 --> 11:31.190
Show up at his gaff. Ding-dong!

11:31.190 --> 11:35.161
They're greeted by a massive
scientific welf... welcome.

11:35.161 --> 11:37.763
Welfcome. Welfcome.

11:40.266 --> 11:41.600
"Hello, boys."

11:41.600 --> 11:46.238
"Exactly what
do you pair of filthy urchins

11:46.238 --> 11:49.775
want to do defaming my step?"

11:49.775 --> 11:54.480
"Well, we have a thing that you might
need for scientific reasons."

11:54.480 --> 11:57.716
"A scalpel?"
"No, we think you might have that."

11:57.716 --> 12:03.322
"What is it?
You pair of emerald chimps."

12:03.322 --> 12:06.492
"We've got the other thing you need."
"Here are the bodies."

12:06.492 --> 12:09.762
They don't know whether
they're gonna get any money for it,

12:09.762 --> 12:11.630
but oh, my Jesus,

12:11.630 --> 12:15.401
he's into it like a hungover
white guy at Wagamamas.

12:15.401 --> 12:18.971
"Lord, has Christmas come early?"

12:18.971 --> 12:21.107
"Take it around the back, boys."

12:21.107 --> 12:25.544
Willy Hare and Willy Burke
sell the body.

12:25.544 --> 12:29.448
Seven pounds for a body.

12:29.448 --> 12:34.487
That, to this day,
is like five grand.

12:34.487 --> 12:37.590
"Willy, Willy, Willy. Willy."

12:37.590 --> 12:40.726
"We just made seven pounds."

12:40.726 --> 12:43.896
"Ooh-ooh!"

12:43.896 --> 12:45.464
That was it. You could tell.

12:45.464 --> 12:48.767
The boys knew
they were into a winner.

12:48.767 --> 12:52.638
That night,
there was a very persistent cough

12:52.638 --> 12:56.208
in Willy O'Hare's guest house.

12:56.208 --> 12:58.511
It was an old man.
Wouldn't stop coughing.

12:58.511 --> 13:00.746
(coughs, splutters)

13:03.649 --> 13:05.351
"If only I had more champagne."

13:08.988 --> 13:10.890
(groans)

13:10.890 --> 13:15.027
Inspiration...
can come at strange moments.

13:15.027 --> 13:18.230
"Willy, you've got a guesthouse."

13:18.230 --> 13:20.332
"Yes, Willy. I do have a guesthouse."

13:20.332 --> 13:24.403
"Willy, you had somebody dead."
"Yes, I did, Willy."

13:24.403 --> 13:28.073
"Willy, we sold that dead person."
"Yes, we did do this."

13:28.073 --> 13:30.876
"Willy, he's about to die."

13:30.876 --> 13:35.414
"Willy, you don't know that."
"Willy, I know that."

13:35.414 --> 13:40.986
Willy O'Hare went straight up there,
opened that door, took a pillow,

13:40.986 --> 13:43.689
and he put it over
that old man's face.

13:51.864 --> 13:55.634
Anyway, long story short,
there's a body to deal with.

13:55.634 --> 13:58.671
"What are we gonna do with this?"

13:58.671 --> 14:01.807
Ding-dong! "Well, hello, boys."

14:01.807 --> 14:06.679
"What have you got here,
you irredeemable rogues?"

14:06.679 --> 14:09.348
Wow, champagne gets you fucked.

14:10.516 --> 14:12.785
It's fantastic.

14:12.785 --> 14:15.387
So Willy and Willy
thought to themselves,

14:15.387 --> 14:19.024
"We don't have more bodies to sell."
"I've got a plan."

14:19.024 --> 14:21.627
"You've got a plan?" Ding!

14:21.627 --> 14:24.730
Hi, erm, could you tell me exactly,

14:24.730 --> 14:29.201
er, I haven't worked out
what your WiFi code is."

14:29.201 --> 14:30.336
Dead.

14:30.336 --> 14:33.572
"Is there a swimming-pool,
sauna complex?" Dead.

14:33.572 --> 14:37.409
"Sky Sports works,
but not as well as it should." Dead.

14:37.409 --> 14:42.915
These boys are particularly
hostile hoteliers.

14:42.915 --> 14:47.886
So once they got cracking, right,
with the hotel guests,

14:47.886 --> 14:50.923
they realise,
where do hotel guests come from?

14:50.923 --> 14:53.792
"Willy, they're dragged
off the street."

14:53.792 --> 14:55.995
"Let's drag people off the street."

14:55.995 --> 14:57.863
The bodies keep piling up.

14:57.863 --> 15:00.666
Dr Knox, he doesn't seem
to have a problem with it.

15:00.666 --> 15:05.671
"Quick as you can, no delaying.
Science never ends."

15:05.671 --> 15:08.707
They had the business model down.

15:08.707 --> 15:10.843
Guests, killed.

15:10.843 --> 15:13.479
Guests, sold.

15:13.479 --> 15:15.447
Money, made.

15:15.447 --> 15:17.650
Victory, achieved.

15:17.650 --> 15:20.686
But like all the great businessmen,

15:20.686 --> 15:24.390
they can fall to their own hubris.
They screw it up.

15:29.495 --> 15:30.963
(glass smashes)

15:30.963 --> 15:34.233
(laughter)

15:34.233 --> 15:36.935
One day they had killed somebody.

15:36.935 --> 15:39.838
"Here, Willy." "Yeah, Willy?"

15:39.838 --> 15:43.309
"Instead of us bringing him
straight to the doctor,

15:43.309 --> 15:45.444
let's just stick him under our bed."

15:45.444 --> 15:48.881
Problem solved. The lads go out,
there's a body under the bed.

15:48.881 --> 15:50.049
What could go wrong?

15:50.049 --> 15:53.986
His missus rents out the room
to a new guest.

15:53.986 --> 15:57.456
The esteemed guest,
she's looking around the room,

15:57.456 --> 16:01.694
"Kettle, plus.
Television, not yet invented."

16:01.694 --> 16:03.495
"Bed, mandatory."

16:03.495 --> 16:06.765
"Corpse, what?!"

16:06.765 --> 16:10.536
She comes back downstairs. Ding!
"Hello?"

16:10.536 --> 16:15.040
"I need to speak to you at about
a slight anomaly in my hotel room."

16:15.040 --> 16:16.442
"Yes?"

16:16.442 --> 16:19.912
"Well, they're usually sans corpse."

16:19.912 --> 16:25.918
"But my room seems to be
very much pro dead fuck."

16:27.920 --> 16:32.391
That's how they got caught.
A bad review on, er, Trivago.

16:32.391 --> 16:34.159
"Corpse under the bed."

16:34.159 --> 16:36.995
In the words of South Carolina,

16:36.995 --> 16:40.366
the boys have fucked the chicken.

16:40.366 --> 16:42.334
The whole story is out.

16:42.334 --> 16:44.670
Willy and Willy, they get arrested.

16:44.670 --> 16:47.573
Dr Knox, he gets arrested.

16:47.573 --> 16:51.009
"What an absolute outrage. Me?!"

16:51.009 --> 16:54.847
So that's it.
Old Bill are involved, Hare's there.

16:54.847 --> 16:56.682
"Hello." "All right."

16:56.682 --> 17:00.185
"We need to speak to you
about the case of...

17:00.185 --> 17:04.757
...mmmmurderrrr!"

17:07.726 --> 17:12.998
"You have murdered a man
and we have the DNA evidence

17:12.998 --> 17:17.536
in the shape
of an entire body made of DNA."

17:17.536 --> 17:21.106
"You're a weak man, I can see that."

17:21.106 --> 17:23.040
"We want to cut you a deal."

17:23.040 --> 17:26.744
"You tell us everything you know
about Burko and his dirty ways

17:26.744 --> 17:31.150
and we, we won't let you go,
but we won't kill you."

17:31.150 --> 17:36.989
And that's what happened.
Willy Hare ratted out Willy Burke.

17:36.989 --> 17:38.757
The outcome of the case was,

17:38.757 --> 17:44.229
Dr Knox had been nothing other than
very handsome and very innocent.

17:44.229 --> 17:48.167
And our dear doctor carried on
with his scientific ways.

17:48.167 --> 17:51.103
Willy Hare, he did a bit abroad,

17:51.103 --> 17:55.207
and eventually he ended up
back in the north... of Ireland.

17:55.207 --> 17:58.210
Willy Burko, he got done.

17:58.210 --> 18:00.712
Not only did he get done,
they hung him.

18:00.712 --> 18:05.884
Everybody cheered.
And then his body was used for...

18:05.884 --> 18:07.886
...medical research.

18:07.886 --> 18:09.488
And to this day, my friends,

18:09.488 --> 18:12.324
Willy Burko's skeleton

18:12.324 --> 18:16.528
is in Edinburgh
Medical Society's museum.

18:16.528 --> 18:18.797
You can see Willy.

18:18.797 --> 18:21.333
You can look at him.

18:21.333 --> 18:24.336
Edinburgh,
they've taken on board, as a city,

18:24.336 --> 18:27.206
the extraordinary tale
of Willy Burke and Willy Hare.

18:27.206 --> 18:31.477
They have commemorated
this odd moment in their history

18:31.477 --> 18:35.848
by naming a strip pub after them.

18:35.848 --> 18:38.183
Top of the Grassmarket,
Burke and Hare.

18:38.183 --> 18:42.888
Pound and a pint, you can look
at a pair of Ukrainian titties.

18:45.157 --> 18:47.493
'I love Andrew Maxwell.
He's bubbly.'

18:47.493 --> 18:50.229
'Well, about 80% bubbly,
20% Guinness.'

18:50.229 --> 18:53.365
'Our last story tonight
is a short tail of a wedding gift

18:53.365 --> 18:56.935
which left Queen Victoria
more than a little cheesed off.'

18:56.935 --> 19:00.072
'On a lethal combo of whisky,
sambuca and beer,

19:00.072 --> 19:02.407
here's Rob Beckett 16 drinks down.'

19:02.407 --> 19:05.611
Hello!
'Legend.'

19:05.611 --> 19:10.916
So, we've all had weird presents
in our lives, haven't we?

19:10.916 --> 19:12.584
For birthday, Christmases.

19:12.584 --> 19:14.653
The worst one I had was a whisk

19:14.653 --> 19:17.923
cos I was really into food technology
at the time.

19:17.923 --> 19:21.994
And I was fat and 15
and my mum didn't know who I was.

19:21.994 --> 19:24.596
But... there's not been
a weirder present

19:24.596 --> 19:27.199
than what Queen Victoria had
for her wedding.

19:27.199 --> 19:32.838
It's 1840, she's preparing
to marry her first cousin.

19:32.838 --> 19:34.806
Bit weird, innit?

19:34.806 --> 19:37.776
Little rule I live by,
don't fuck your cousins,

19:37.776 --> 19:41.079
and do not eat rice two days old.

19:41.079 --> 19:45.384
Cos reheated rice
is worse than incest.

19:45.384 --> 19:47.686
That's just something I've been told.

19:47.686 --> 19:51.390
So, obviously, in Somerset,
they're thinking,

19:51.390 --> 19:55.394
"Right, Queen's wedding,
what we gonna do?"

19:55.394 --> 19:58.530
They've obviously ignored
the John Lewis wish list.

19:58.530 --> 20:01.133
They're thinking,
"They don't need towels."

20:01.133 --> 20:03.635
"What could make her day
even more special?"

20:03.635 --> 20:05.237
"Give her a bit of cheese."

20:05.237 --> 20:08.807
These villagers
have got 750 cows in one place.

20:08.807 --> 20:11.910
They're milking them, mate.
They're milking these...

20:11.910 --> 20:14.646
(man) Rob, Rob...
Can I not do that?

20:14.646 --> 20:17.015
So, they've got 750 cows.

20:17.015 --> 20:20.519
They give her an 80-stone,
nine-foot bit of cheese.

20:20.519 --> 20:23.722
Queen Victoria is like,
"That's a lovely bit of cheese."

20:23.722 --> 20:25.490
"What a lovely bit of cheese."

20:25.490 --> 20:29.094
Deep down she's thinking, "What
am I gonna do with this cheese?"

20:29.094 --> 20:31.563
"It's nine foot high,
what am I gonna do?"

20:31.563 --> 20:35.634
The villagers go,
"I'm so happy you love the cheese."

20:35.634 --> 20:39.838
"Please, Queen Victoria,
can we take it on tour of Somerset?"

20:39.838 --> 20:44.209
She is going... "Of course you can."

20:44.209 --> 20:46.845
"Take the cheese, tour it."

20:46.845 --> 20:48.747
"Give it its due."

20:48.747 --> 20:53.585
"But get it as far away from me
as you possibly can."

20:53.585 --> 20:56.855
So basically,
this cheese has been everywhere.

20:56.855 --> 21:00.359
It's toured
the full southwest of England.

21:00.359 --> 21:02.227
However, at the end of the tour,

21:02.227 --> 21:05.330
the cheese turns up
at the Queen's house.

21:05.330 --> 21:09.167
She goes, "Oh! Oh, the cheese."

21:09.167 --> 21:11.036
And in her head she's thinking,

21:11.036 --> 21:13.605
"I thought I got rid of this
six months ago."

21:13.605 --> 21:18.677
Then she goes, "People of Somerset,
I'll be honest with you."

21:18.677 --> 21:21.313
"I don't want this cheese."

21:21.313 --> 21:26.318
"I know you spent ages making it...
but it's rubbish."

21:26.318 --> 21:29.254
Goes back to Somerset,
they're all arguing over it.

21:29.254 --> 21:34.893
"Steve, it was your idea."
"Yeah, but you bought the cows."

21:34.893 --> 21:37.162
They're all arguing,
arguing, arguing.

21:37.162 --> 21:41.533
What happens was,
they chop it all up,

21:41.533 --> 21:43.635
stand it all on their ends...

21:45.771 --> 21:47.572
...Stonehenge.

21:48.840 --> 21:50.876
(man) Is that factually correct?

21:50.876 --> 21:53.345
No. That is not factually correct.

21:53.345 --> 21:55.947
But what a lovely end
to this story if it was.

21:58.116 --> 22:02.688
'That's the end of this week's show.
Before I go, one piece of advice.'

22:02.688 --> 22:06.992
'If you've had a few drinks and are
thinking about calling your ex,

22:06.992 --> 22:11.430
you're absolutely right to do so.
They bloody love that. Good night.'
