Peter, are you sure
you're allowed

00:35.536 --> 00:37.162
to bring a baby
onto the golf course?

00:37.246 --> 00:39.331
Well, Lois asked me to watch
Stewie for the afternoon.

00:39.414 --> 00:41.333
It's all right, I don't
think the club will mind.

00:41.416 --> 00:42.626
It's Cleveland
I'm worried about.

00:42.709 --> 00:44.962
Peter, is this
really necessary?

00:45.045 --> 00:47.047
I can't hardly
see anything.

00:47.130 --> 00:48.882
Hey, look,
it's President Nixon.

00:48.966 --> 00:50.592
No, wait,
it's a black guy.

00:50.676 --> 00:52.052
No, it's Nixon.

00:52.135 --> 00:53.804
Oh, boy, that was close.

00:53.887 --> 00:55.055
Oh, will you
please hurry up?

00:55.138 --> 00:56.723
It's 100 degrees
out here.

00:56.807 --> 00:59.309
Oh, you're a worse parent
than Britney Spears.

00:59.393 --> 01:01.144
I know, I know.

01:02.396 --> 01:04.481
Oh, the gift basket was
not worth the trip--

01:04.565 --> 01:05.649
not by a long shot.

01:05.732 --> 01:06.733
(doorbell ringing)

01:06.817 --> 01:09.403
Oh, I got to get that.
I'll talk to you later.

01:09.486 --> 01:10.988
(sizzling)

01:12.698 --> 01:13.949
Hey, uh, Joe...

01:14.032 --> 01:15.158
Don't say it, Peter.

01:15.242 --> 01:16.451
I was just wondering...

01:16.535 --> 01:18.328
Peter, I swear to God...

01:18.412 --> 01:19.413
What's your handicap?

01:19.496 --> 01:21.456
(screaming)

01:21.540 --> 01:25.544
Every hole-- that's a joke
that just doesn't get old!

01:27.462 --> 01:28.714
(bleep) damn it!

01:28.797 --> 01:31.175
Come on! Come on! (bleep)!

01:31.258 --> 01:32.301
Come on, Glen!

01:32.384 --> 01:34.303
Come on, get your head in
the (bleep) game!

01:34.386 --> 01:35.679
(yelling)

01:35.762 --> 01:38.724
Hey, do you think it's time
to talk to Quagmire

01:38.807 --> 01:41.101
about his anger issues
with this game?

01:41.185 --> 01:44.104
A white man shouldn't play
sports in the first place.

01:45.689 --> 01:47.441
Hey, hey, hey, hey,
that's a stroke!

01:47.524 --> 01:49.651
I just tapped my ball,
Quagmire. Relax.

01:49.735 --> 01:50.736
Oh, relax?
Oh, okay.

01:50.819 --> 01:52.321
Oh, oh, look, I just
tapped my ball.

01:52.404 --> 01:53.405
Oh, just tapped it again.

01:53.488 --> 01:54.615
Oh, oh, tap, tap, tap.

01:54.698 --> 01:56.408
Oh, where is it?
Oh! It's in the hole.

01:56.491 --> 01:58.118
Eagle. Yay, Quagmire.

01:59.369 --> 02:02.122
Hey, Quagmire, you know
it's not fun when you're like this.

02:02.206 --> 02:04.583
You want fun? Go home
and buy a monkey.

02:04.666 --> 02:06.793
What does that even mean?
I don't know.

02:06.877 --> 02:08.462
Boy, we've got
a beautiful day for this.

02:11.924 --> 02:13.425
Hi, Mr. Herbert.

02:13.509 --> 02:14.760
Here's your paper.

02:14.843 --> 02:17.554
Oh, sorry, Chris,
but I'm afraid

02:17.638 --> 02:19.681
I'm going to have
to cancel my subscription.

02:19.765 --> 02:22.184
Cancel? But you
love this paper.

02:22.267 --> 02:24.811
Listen, I think you're
a real nice guy,

02:24.895 --> 02:27.940
but I've just decided to go
with another paper.

02:28.023 --> 02:29.274
Hello, there, Kyle.

02:29.358 --> 02:31.151
You look nice today.

02:31.235 --> 02:33.237
I see you're wearing
your big shorts

02:33.320 --> 02:36.073
with the baggy leg holes
that flutter so carelessly

02:36.156 --> 02:37.449
in the breeze.

02:37.533 --> 02:38.867
Here's your paper.

02:38.951 --> 02:39.952
What are you
doing here?

02:40.035 --> 02:41.078
Beat it, nerd.

02:41.161 --> 02:42.287
Thank you.

02:42.371 --> 02:44.331
Would you like to come inside
for a cupcake

02:44.414 --> 02:45.707
and a glass of wine?

02:45.791 --> 02:47.167
Shut up, old man.

02:47.251 --> 02:49.002
Mm.

02:49.086 --> 02:51.296
What's going on
in my pants?

02:51.380 --> 02:54.216
Looks like we got
six more weeks of winter.

02:58.011 --> 03:01.974
ANNOUNCER: We now return to Cutting in
Line in Front of Italians.

03:02.057 --> 03:03.141
Ayy!
Oh!

03:03.225 --> 03:04.226
Ayy!
Oh!

03:04.309 --> 03:06.812
ALL: Ayy, whoa, whoa, whoa.

03:06.895 --> 03:08.856
Hey, Copernicus, why don't
you navigate yourself

03:08.939 --> 03:11.108
to the back of the line
with your feet

03:11.191 --> 03:12.401
and stand there
with your shirt?

03:12.484 --> 03:14.361
Hey, Peter, how
was your golf game?

03:14.444 --> 03:16.697
Well, Lois, you tied
my golf shoes a little tight

03:16.780 --> 03:18.073
before I left the house.

03:18.156 --> 03:19.992
Had to deal with that all day.
Thank you very much.

03:20.075 --> 03:21.660
Oh, my God, look
at Stewie!

03:21.743 --> 03:23.579
Peter, you took him out
without any sunscreen?

03:23.662 --> 03:24.872
Maybe.

03:24.955 --> 03:27.499
You know the sun is
dangerous for a baby's skin.

03:27.583 --> 03:28.876
Peter, this is more
irresponsible

03:28.959 --> 03:31.378
than when you fed your mogwai
after midnight.

03:31.461 --> 03:33.547
Peter, didn't the little
Chinese man tell you

03:33.630 --> 03:35.340
not to feed him
after midnight?

03:35.424 --> 03:37.176
Aw, come on, Lois,
he's so cute.

03:37.259 --> 03:38.260
And he's hungry.

03:38.343 --> 03:40.721
What could happen?

03:40.804 --> 03:42.514
(squealing)

03:42.598 --> 03:44.808
Hello, I'm Fran Drescher.

03:44.892 --> 03:46.393
(annoying laugh)

03:46.476 --> 03:47.644
(screaming)
(screaming)

03:47.728 --> 03:48.896
Kill it! Kill it!

03:49.980 --> 03:51.315
(splat)

03:51.398 --> 03:53.233
What the deuce are you
all staring at?

03:53.317 --> 03:54.902
Is there something
wrong with me?

03:57.029 --> 03:58.030
(gasps)

03:58.113 --> 03:59.781
Wow, look at me.

03:59.865 --> 04:00.866
I'm a young Eartha Kitt.

04:00.949 --> 04:02.409
(purring)

04:02.492 --> 04:06.288
"President Johnson, bring our
boys home from Southeast Asia.

04:06.371 --> 04:08.123
It's an unwinnable war..."

04:08.207 --> 04:09.291
(purring)

04:11.627 --> 04:15.422
Dad, I was wondering
if I could borrow $17.

04:15.506 --> 04:16.798
Chris, what do you
need money for?

04:16.882 --> 04:18.467
Isn't that why you have
a paper route?

04:18.550 --> 04:22.679
No, this new kid named Kyle
keeps stealing all my customers.

04:22.763 --> 04:24.431
Oh, that's terrible.

04:24.515 --> 04:26.266
You're a wonderful
paperboy, Chris,

04:26.350 --> 04:28.393
and you need to remind
your customers of that.

04:28.477 --> 04:30.646
She's right, you got
to stand up for yourself.

04:30.729 --> 04:32.272
Like my great-grandfather--

04:32.356 --> 04:34.816
Turn-Of-The-Century-Take-On-All-
Comers Griffin.

04:34.900 --> 04:36.527
All right, put 'em up,
put 'em up.

04:36.610 --> 04:37.778
Are you having
a bully day?

04:37.861 --> 04:38.862
I'm having a bully day.

04:38.946 --> 04:40.239
Is everyone having
a bully day?

04:40.322 --> 04:41.323
Bully.
Bully.

04:41.406 --> 04:42.407
Yes, Bully.

04:42.491 --> 04:45.118
Oh, thank God we live
in this time.

04:46.370 --> 04:49.122
(lounge music playing softly)

04:49.206 --> 04:50.666
Stewie, what
are you doing?

04:50.749 --> 04:52.793
Just getting my
bronze on, baby.

04:52.876 --> 04:55.921
Hey, what do you think
of my recumbent tan pose?

04:56.004 --> 04:57.840
Oh, legs probably spread
a little wider than

04:57.923 --> 04:59.967
they ought to be,
but who gives a damn?

05:00.050 --> 05:02.553
This is just tan Stewie
being tan Stewie.

05:02.636 --> 05:04.012
Check me out, Brian.

05:11.395 --> 05:12.938
(doorbell rings)

05:13.021 --> 05:15.899
Hey, Mr. Herbert,
I want you back.

05:15.983 --> 05:18.151
Please, will you be my
paper customer again?

05:18.235 --> 05:20.487
Oh, uh, hey, Chris.

05:20.571 --> 05:22.155
Oh, is that my phone?

05:22.239 --> 05:26.326
(imitating cell
phone ring tone)

05:26.410 --> 05:28.120
Well, better go get that.

05:28.203 --> 05:29.746
Well, if it isn't
King Lardass.

05:29.830 --> 05:31.415
Don't call me names, Kyle.

05:31.498 --> 05:33.542
Hi, Kyle.

05:33.625 --> 05:36.086
(humming tune)

05:36.170 --> 05:38.046
Well, listen, it was
wrong of you

05:38.130 --> 05:39.840
to steal my customer
away from me.

05:39.923 --> 05:41.175
And I want him back.

05:41.258 --> 05:43.135
Oh, yeah?

05:43.218 --> 05:44.511
(laughing)

05:44.595 --> 05:46.305
Look, Griffin
got his ass kicked.

05:46.388 --> 05:47.764
What a loser.

05:47.848 --> 05:50.559
I have that
shirt at home.

05:50.642 --> 05:52.853
You... you pushed me.

05:52.936 --> 05:55.314
Boys, boys, we can
settle this

05:55.397 --> 05:58.108
like reasonable
and sexy teenagers.

05:58.192 --> 06:02.321
Whoever can swallow the most
Tylenol PM wins.

06:09.203 --> 06:11.163
Oh, my God, Chris,
what happened?!

06:11.246 --> 06:13.040
Kyle beat me up.

06:13.123 --> 06:14.958
You let that little punk
beat you up?

06:15.042 --> 06:16.210
Peter, you should be
more sympathetic.

06:16.293 --> 06:17.961
Remember, you had
a bully, too,

06:18.045 --> 06:19.171
when you were his age.

06:19.254 --> 06:20.506
Yeah, you're right.

06:20.589 --> 06:24.301
Randy Fulcher used to pants me
every chance he got.

06:24.384 --> 06:27.304
My book report is on
The Giving Tree.

06:27.387 --> 06:28.388
Nerd!

06:28.472 --> 06:30.265
(laughing)

06:30.349 --> 06:31.642
Randy!

06:33.227 --> 06:34.228
Nerd!

06:34.311 --> 06:35.521
(laughing)

06:35.604 --> 06:37.231
Randy!

06:39.983 --> 06:41.360
Nerd!

06:41.443 --> 06:42.528
Randy!

06:42.611 --> 06:44.404
Peter, I think one
of us should go over

06:44.488 --> 06:46.198
and have a talk
with Kyle's parents.

06:46.281 --> 06:47.491
I'll do it, Lois.

06:47.574 --> 06:50.118
Right after a healthy breakfast
of juice, toast

06:50.202 --> 06:52.454
and store brand imitation
frosted flakes

06:52.538 --> 06:54.289
featuring Terry the Tiger.

06:54.373 --> 06:56.166
They'rrrre... food.

06:59.461 --> 07:01.755
Hey, ladies, you mind
if I park here?

07:01.839 --> 07:03.215
I'll only be a few minutes.

07:03.298 --> 07:04.883
Stewie, what is that
on your lip?

07:04.967 --> 07:06.343
I drew a pencil mustache.

07:06.426 --> 07:08.178
I like it 'cause it's just
above my lip.

07:08.262 --> 07:09.471
The kind of mustache that says,

07:09.555 --> 07:11.390
"Yeah, I've been nude
on camera. What of it?"

07:11.473 --> 07:13.517
Come here, I'll take
care of that, sweetie.

07:13.600 --> 07:16.144
Ew, ew, it's got
spit all over it.

07:16.228 --> 07:19.439
Now I know what it feels
like to have dinner with Martin Landau.

07:19.523 --> 07:22.150
What people forget
about Polanski

07:22.234 --> 07:24.820
is Polanski wasn't
a perfectionist.

07:24.903 --> 07:29.199
And pedophile or not, he,
he was a perfectly professional person.

07:29.283 --> 07:30.450
And punctual.

07:30.534 --> 07:33.287
Yeah, maybe we could talk
about something else?

07:33.370 --> 07:37.541
You know my wife and I
are very involved in Planned Parenthood.

07:37.624 --> 07:41.962
Which provides possibilities
for people who are underprivileged.

07:42.045 --> 07:44.339
Maybe chew your food
a little, champ.

07:47.676 --> 07:51.388
(lounge music playing)

07:51.471 --> 07:53.056
Who are all these people?

07:53.140 --> 07:55.684
Oh, just a few friends over
to enjoy this gorgeous weather,

07:55.767 --> 07:57.269
and maybe take a dip
in the pool.

07:57.352 --> 07:58.854
Hey, Devon,
Devon, come here.

07:58.937 --> 07:59.938
Brian, this is Devon.

08:00.022 --> 08:02.065
Devon just finished
directing a movie.

08:02.149 --> 08:03.942
Yeah, it, uh, stars
a little actress

08:04.026 --> 08:05.569
named Joan Van Ark.

08:05.652 --> 08:06.653
Maybe you've heard of her.

08:06.737 --> 08:07.779
(laughing)

08:07.863 --> 08:08.906
Right. Possibly.

08:08.989 --> 08:10.115
You're talking
out of your ass.

08:10.199 --> 08:11.992
It doesn't matter,
Brian, I'm tan.

08:12.075 --> 08:13.869
Hey, Brian, Brian, Brian,

08:13.952 --> 08:15.412
look at my tan walk.

08:16.455 --> 08:17.873
(sighs)

08:17.956 --> 08:18.999
Devon, do you
have a cigarette?

08:19.082 --> 08:21.001
Sure. And here's a copy
of my last movie.

08:21.084 --> 08:22.377
It's essentially
Brokeback Mountain

08:22.461 --> 08:24.254
from the point of view
of the horses.

08:25.464 --> 08:26.924
Hey, the sun's been up
for an hour.

08:27.007 --> 08:28.008
Shouldn't we
get riding?

08:28.091 --> 08:29.134
Uh, are they
still sleeping?

08:29.218 --> 08:31.053
I don't know. I'll check.

08:31.136 --> 08:32.596
(screaming)

08:32.679 --> 08:33.931
What, what, what is it?!

08:34.014 --> 08:35.682
Oh, God! Oh, my God!
What?

08:35.766 --> 08:36.767
Oh, my God!

08:36.850 --> 08:37.935
Run!

08:39.394 --> 08:40.521
(doorbell rings)

08:41.688 --> 08:43.398
Hey, there. Are you,
uh, Kyle's parents?

08:43.482 --> 08:44.566
Yes. Can we help you?

08:44.650 --> 08:45.776
Yeah, I'm Peter Griffin.

08:45.859 --> 08:48.111
Uh, listen, apparently your son
got into a little scrape

08:48.195 --> 08:49.363
with my kid.

08:49.446 --> 08:51.615
Oh, dear, they're
not getting along?

08:51.698 --> 08:53.325
Like an old guy
and a midget.

08:55.035 --> 08:57.371
Sir, will you please
stop staring at me?

08:57.454 --> 08:58.872
Where's the rest of ya?

08:58.956 --> 09:01.458
So, listen, Chris
is pretty upset about what happened.

09:01.542 --> 09:03.001
Would you mind if I had
a word with your son?

09:03.085 --> 09:05.420
Not at all.
He's up in his room.

09:05.504 --> 09:06.588
Hey, there.

09:06.672 --> 09:08.924
Kyle? Hey, I'm
Chris Griffin's father.

09:09.007 --> 09:10.676
(mocking tone): Hey, I'm Chris
Griffin's father.

09:10.759 --> 09:12.219
That's not very nice.

09:12.302 --> 09:13.887
I don't sound
like that at all.

09:13.971 --> 09:15.722
You're making me sound
like Michael Stipe.

09:15.806 --> 09:17.182
Listen, I just want
you to know

09:17.266 --> 09:19.017
what you did the other day
was wrong.

09:19.101 --> 09:20.727
What you did
the other day was wrong.

09:20.811 --> 09:22.145
You're not making
this easy, Kyle.

09:22.229 --> 09:23.730
You're not making
this easy, Kyle.

09:23.814 --> 09:24.857
My name's Peter Griffin.

09:24.940 --> 09:26.692
I'm a big, fat, dumb
butt-face.

09:26.775 --> 09:27.985
Shut up, Kyle.

09:28.068 --> 09:29.194
I'm Peter Griffin.

09:29.278 --> 09:30.988
I'm a dorky, fat,
numb-nuts.

09:31.071 --> 09:32.072
Kyle, I said shut up.

09:32.155 --> 09:34.533
You're a poop-nose.

09:34.616 --> 09:36.076
Ow! Ow! Oh, God! Ow!

09:39.204 --> 09:40.956
(grunting and groaning)

09:43.166 --> 09:45.252
(groans)

09:46.670 --> 09:48.463
(groaning fades)

09:54.636 --> 09:55.721
Hey, Peter.

09:55.804 --> 09:57.723
Hey, what's going on?
Is something wrong?

09:57.806 --> 10:01.476
No, no, no, no, no, no, everything's...
everything's cool right now.

10:01.560 --> 10:02.853
Might be some
problems later,

10:02.936 --> 10:05.564
but, uh, we'll cross that
bridge when we come to it.

10:05.647 --> 10:06.857
(phone ringing)

10:06.940 --> 10:08.567
LOIS:
Hello.

10:08.650 --> 10:10.402
Peter did what?!

10:10.485 --> 10:12.029
Well, I'd best
be getting to work.

10:12.112 --> 10:13.113
It's nighttime.

10:13.197 --> 10:14.198
Boy, you said it.

10:14.281 --> 10:15.657
All right,
take it easy.

10:17.951 --> 10:20.245
Peter, you get down
from that tree this instant!

10:20.329 --> 10:22.164
No! You're gonna
yell at me!

10:22.247 --> 10:24.041
You're damn right
I'm gonna yell at you.

10:24.124 --> 10:26.001
You beat up
a 13-year-old boy!

10:26.084 --> 10:27.711
He called me names!

10:27.794 --> 10:30.756
You're 43, and you
just assaulted our neighbor's child!

10:30.839 --> 10:33.008
This is a very
serious situation!

10:33.091 --> 10:35.302
Well, maybe you should
have just had an abortion, Lois!

10:35.385 --> 10:37.763
Would that make
you happy if I was never born?!

10:37.846 --> 10:38.847
What?

10:38.931 --> 10:39.973
I'm going to prison,
aren't I?

10:44.561 --> 10:45.687
What are you doing?

10:45.771 --> 10:47.022
Got to keep the tan up.

10:47.105 --> 10:49.650
It's not a skin color,
it's a lifestyle, Brian.

10:49.733 --> 10:52.236
See, you wouldn't know that
because you're white as a ghost.

10:52.319 --> 10:55.405
You're haunting this house
with your whiteness, Brian.

10:55.489 --> 10:57.199
Hey, wake me up in 15,
will ya, babe?

10:57.282 --> 10:58.283
Fine.

11:00.786 --> 11:03.413
(singing along):

11:03.497 --> 11:07.209
♪ Baby, why don't we go down

11:07.292 --> 11:11.547

11:33.527 --> 11:35.737
I was just coming
to tell ya it's time to get out.

11:35.821 --> 11:37.823
I've been in there
for six and a half hours,

11:37.906 --> 11:39.491
you son of a bitch!
Don't touch me!

11:39.575 --> 11:40.576
Well, how, how...?

11:40.659 --> 11:41.660
Can, can you get up?

11:41.743 --> 11:42.744
I'll try.

I can't do it!

11:54.131 --> 11:55.132
Get the lotion!

11:55.215 --> 11:56.425
Put the lotion on me!

11:58.010 --> 11:59.178
Brian!

11:59.261 --> 12:01.555
Oh, uh, hi, Mr. Furley.

12:01.638 --> 12:04.266
Never mind!
I'll come back later!

12:06.143 --> 12:07.561
Now be polite, Peter.

12:07.644 --> 12:09.438
Kyle's mother agreed
not to press charges

12:09.521 --> 12:10.647
if you apologize.

12:10.731 --> 12:11.732
Hello, Lois.

12:11.815 --> 12:12.900
Hello, Claire.

12:12.983 --> 12:14.902
We just came by
because there's something

12:14.985 --> 12:16.904
Peter would like
to say to Kyle.

12:16.987 --> 12:17.988
Go on.

12:18.071 --> 12:19.072
(mumbles):
Slorry.

12:19.156 --> 12:20.199
Say it right, Peter.

12:20.282 --> 12:21.283
Ow! Ow! Sorry!

12:21.366 --> 12:22.868
Thank you, Peter.

12:22.951 --> 12:24.203
Now what do you say, Kyle?

12:24.286 --> 12:25.329
Apology accepted.

12:25.412 --> 12:26.997
Good. Now why don't you
patch things up

12:27.080 --> 12:29.750
with Mr. Griffin
by showing him your Legos, hmm?

12:29.833 --> 12:31.502
You got Legos?
Aw, sweet!

12:31.585 --> 12:33.962
Lois only buys me
Mega Bloks.

12:34.046 --> 12:35.339
They're the same thing,
Peter.

12:35.422 --> 12:37.299
You know what, Lois?
They are not the same thing.

12:37.382 --> 12:39.468
And the sooner
you get that through your thick skull,

12:39.551 --> 12:41.887
the sooner we can get
this marriage back on track.

12:41.970 --> 12:44.473
Hey, listen, uh,
sorry about beating you up.

12:44.556 --> 12:46.016
I felt pretty bad
about it.

12:46.099 --> 12:47.518
Hey, this look
like a spaceship to you?

12:47.601 --> 12:48.894
Sorta.

12:48.977 --> 12:51.355
Huh. Well, I never was
very good at building things.

12:51.438 --> 12:54.358
Like that time I built
that handmade electric razor.

12:54.441 --> 12:57.402
By gluing many razor blades
to this ordinary desk fan,

12:57.486 --> 12:59.821
I'll save time
in my morning routine.

13:01.073 --> 13:02.074
(whirring)

13:02.157 --> 13:03.325
(screams)

13:03.408 --> 13:06.286
Lois, I done it again.

13:10.749 --> 13:12.167
You don't have to apologize.

13:12.251 --> 13:13.961
I would have done
the same thing.

13:14.044 --> 13:16.338
I mean, bullying makes you
feel pretty cool.

13:16.421 --> 13:18.715
Yeah, guess it was kinda cool.

13:18.799 --> 13:20.676
You know, I always used
to be the nerd

13:20.759 --> 13:22.052
getting bullied,
but doing it to someone else

13:22.135 --> 13:23.220
was pretty sweet.

13:23.303 --> 13:24.680
And the more
you do it,

13:24.763 --> 13:26.348
the sweeter it gets.

13:29.685 --> 13:32.062
(oil sizzling)

13:32.145 --> 13:33.146
(shrieks)

13:33.230 --> 13:34.731
Cook much?
(laughs)

13:34.815 --> 13:35.816
Peter, what the hell
is wrong with you?!

13:35.899 --> 13:36.900
What's wrong with me?

13:36.984 --> 13:37.985
You're the one
punching yourself

13:38.068 --> 13:39.069
in the face.
(laughing)

13:39.152 --> 13:40.153
Peter, stop it.

13:40.237 --> 13:41.238
Hey, Lois,
how come you keep

13:41.321 --> 13:42.322
punching yourself in the face?
Cut it out!

13:42.406 --> 13:44.241
Peter, knock it off!
You're gonna hurt yourself.

13:44.324 --> 13:46.034
Ha! You're getting her good!

13:46.118 --> 13:47.953
Hey, Stewie,
nice sunburn.

13:48.036 --> 13:49.872
God, you horse's ass!

13:53.542 --> 13:56.336
(ripping sounds)

13:56.879 --> 13:57.921
Ew!

13:58.005 --> 13:59.381
Hey, Brian, you want
some Stewie jerky?

13:59.464 --> 14:01.008
Oh, God,
that is disgusting.

14:01.091 --> 14:02.509
I'm finally
starting to peel.

14:02.593 --> 14:05.429
I'm telling you,
Brian, my tanning days are over.

14:05.512 --> 14:06.847
I'm just glad I stopped

14:06.930 --> 14:08.640
before I did any real damage
to my skin.

14:08.724 --> 14:09.850
I wouldn't be so sure.

14:09.933 --> 14:12.060
I don't remember you having
that mole before.

14:12.144 --> 14:13.812
What the devil?
Where did that come from?

14:13.896 --> 14:14.897
Brian, what is that?

14:14.980 --> 14:15.981
I don't know.

14:16.064 --> 14:17.482
Of course, your sunburn
was pretty bad.

14:17.566 --> 14:20.235
I suppose
it could be the "C" word.

14:20.319 --> 14:22.446
What the hell does that have to
do with anything?

14:22.529 --> 14:23.572
No, cancer.

14:23.655 --> 14:26.200
Oh, oh, oh, I-I
thought you meant...

14:26.283 --> 14:27.284
It's not important.

14:27.367 --> 14:29.369
Oh, no! Cancer!

14:34.249 --> 14:36.835
Well, the mole looks benign,
but we won't know for sure

14:36.919 --> 14:39.421
whether it's cancerous
until the tests come back in a few days.

14:39.505 --> 14:41.632
A few days?!
I could be dead by then!

14:41.715 --> 14:43.842
Relax, Stewie.
He said it looks benign.

14:43.926 --> 14:45.260
We'll just have
to wait and see.

14:45.344 --> 14:47.262
Jim Henson had
a wait-and-see attitude

14:47.346 --> 14:48.805
and look what
happened to him.

14:53.977 --> 14:54.978
I'm hungry.

14:55.062 --> 14:56.063
Oh, that's no problem.

14:56.146 --> 14:57.147
I could cook
you something.

14:57.231 --> 14:58.232
You want some spaghetti?

14:58.315 --> 15:00.400
That's, like,
my specialty and junk.

15:00.484 --> 15:03.362
Yay...

15:07.282 --> 15:08.909
Ow!

15:08.992 --> 15:10.619
Dad, what's wrong
with you?!

15:10.702 --> 15:12.704
Why are you acting
like such a bully?

15:12.788 --> 15:15.123
'Cause there are two kinds of people
in this world, Chris.

15:15.207 --> 15:17.000
There are bullies
and there are nerds.

15:17.084 --> 15:19.127
And there are
hot Asian chicks.

Beat it, Lois.

17:29.341 --> 17:30.425
Peter, stop it!

17:30.509 --> 17:31.802
Joe is your friend.

17:31.885 --> 17:33.470
Shut up, ya nerd!

17:33.554 --> 17:34.721
Hey!

17:34.805 --> 17:36.139
Peter, look
at yourself.

17:36.223 --> 17:37.599
You are no different
than that bully

17:37.683 --> 17:38.892
who used to pick
on you.

17:38.976 --> 17:39.977
Are you kidding?

17:40.060 --> 17:41.395
I'm nothing like
Randy Fulcher.

17:41.478 --> 17:42.521
Oh, no?

17:42.604 --> 17:44.106
Does that look
familiar?

17:46.400 --> 17:48.527
Oh, my God,
you're right, Lois.

17:48.610 --> 17:51.071
I shouldn't be bullying
the people I care about.

17:51.154 --> 17:53.824
I should be bullying
Randy Fulcher!

17:53.907 --> 17:55.492
He's the jerk
in all this.

17:55.576 --> 17:58.161
Like Dick Cheney
when he was a Wal-Mart greeter.

17:58.245 --> 18:01.248
Go (bleep) yourself.
Go (bleep) yourself.

18:01.331 --> 18:03.292
Go (bleep) yourself.

18:06.170 --> 18:07.296
Well, that's it
for the list.

18:07.379 --> 18:08.714
Not quite, Brian.

18:08.797 --> 18:12.176
There's one more thing
I need you to do before I die.

18:12.259 --> 18:14.011
Write down my
final thoughts.

18:14.094 --> 18:15.095
Oh, come on!

18:15.179 --> 18:17.472
(raspy voice):
I don't have much time!

18:17.556 --> 18:19.099
(sighs)

18:19.183 --> 18:22.728
Oh, squiggly line
in my eye fluid,

18:22.811 --> 18:24.646
I see you there

18:24.730 --> 18:27.691
lurking on the
periphery of my vision,

18:27.774 --> 18:30.444
but when I try
to look at you,

18:30.527 --> 18:32.154
you scurry away.

18:32.237 --> 18:35.240
Are you shy,
squiggly line?

18:35.324 --> 18:37.576
Why only when
I ignore you

18:37.659 --> 18:41.371
do you return to the
center of my eye?

18:41.455 --> 18:45.083
Oh, squiggly line,
it's all right.

18:45.167 --> 18:46.627
You are forgiven.

18:46.710 --> 18:47.920
(phone rings)

18:48.003 --> 18:50.547
Hello. Oh, hi,
Dr. Hartman.

18:50.631 --> 18:53.175
All right, I'll tell him.
Thanks. Bye.

18:53.258 --> 18:55.594
You don't have cancer.
You're gonna be fine.

18:55.677 --> 18:58.680
Really?! Oh, thank God!
Oh, thank God!

18:58.764 --> 18:59.973
Wait, wait.

19:00.057 --> 19:01.350
Look, there's no reason

19:01.433 --> 19:03.143
we can't finish
the memoir anyway.

19:03.227 --> 19:04.978
Let's see what
you've got so far.

19:07.064 --> 19:10.651
Oh, you are just the
worst type of person.

19:12.110 --> 19:14.071
Dad, what are
we doing here?

19:14.154 --> 19:18.617
Chris, I'm gonna show you
how to stand up to a bully.

19:18.700 --> 19:20.661
Hey, Fulcher!

19:20.744 --> 19:21.954
Griffin?

19:22.037 --> 19:23.080
The feeling's mutual.

19:23.163 --> 19:24.456
What are you doing here?

19:24.540 --> 19:26.667
I'm here to kick
your ass, Fulcher.

19:26.750 --> 19:27.751
I'm gonna beat ya,

19:27.876 --> 19:29.545
and then my son Chris
is gonna beat ya.

19:29.628 --> 19:32.130
It's gonna be an old-fashioned
father-son beat-off.

19:32.214 --> 19:33.215
Wait a minute, Dad.

19:33.298 --> 19:34.424
You can't hit him!

19:34.508 --> 19:35.884
Yeah, I have MS.

19:36.051 --> 19:37.553
Oh, you hear that, Chris?

19:37.636 --> 19:39.054
This guy's got
a monkey scrotum

19:39.137 --> 19:40.180
and he's bragging about it.

19:40.264 --> 19:42.266
Now you really got me mad.

19:42.349 --> 19:43.350
No, Dad!

19:52.317 --> 19:55.696
Ow! Ow!
Oh, God! Ah!

19:55.779 --> 19:57.447
(both sobbing)

19:58.323 --> 20:00.784
Sorry I had
to do that, Dad.

20:00.868 --> 20:02.202
But you wanted
me to learn

20:02.286 --> 20:03.745
to stand
up to a bully.

20:03.829 --> 20:06.206
Well, I'm standing up to you.

20:06.290 --> 20:08.792
Stop bullying people, Dad!

20:08.876 --> 20:11.128
My God, Chris,
you're right.

20:11.211 --> 20:12.254
Look at me.

20:12.337 --> 20:13.839
Look what I've become.

20:13.922 --> 20:15.841
I thought it'd feel good
to be a bully,

20:15.924 --> 20:18.302
but all I did was make people
feel as bad

20:18.385 --> 20:20.137
as Randy made me feel.

20:20.220 --> 20:21.972
I'm just a big jackass.

20:22.055 --> 20:23.307
It's all right, Dad.

20:23.390 --> 20:24.641
I forgive you.

20:24.725 --> 20:28.061
As long as you promise
never to bully anyone again.

20:28.145 --> 20:30.397
I promise, Chris.

20:30.480 --> 20:32.608
I mean, you know,
unless I get really stinkin' drunk,

20:32.691 --> 20:35.444
in which case all you got to do
is outrun your sister.

20:35.527 --> 20:36.862
Oh, I like that.

20:36.945 --> 20:37.946
That's nice.

20:38.030 --> 20:39.364
That's a warm
family moment.

20:39.448 --> 20:42.117
I agree. We can all learn
something from that.

20:42.201 --> 20:43.327
(African-American voice):
Wocka, wocka...

20:43.410 --> 20:45.871
who wants to hear
a funny-ass joke?

20:47.831 --> 20:50.959
