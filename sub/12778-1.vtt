WEBVTT

00:35.035 --> 00:37.136
<i> The supernatural.</i>

00:38.438 --> 00:41.940
<i> It's our word for shit</i>
<i> we don't understand.</i>

00:44.145 --> 00:46.378
<i> I was like you once...</i>

00:47.147 --> 00:48.781
<i> ...a skeptic...</i>

00:49.783 --> 00:53.218
<i> ...but now my eyes are open.</i>

00:55.121 --> 00:57.589
<i> But like so many answers...</i>

00:58.525 --> 01:01.727
<i> ...it just leads</i>
<i> to more questions.</i>

01:03.363 --> 01:06.365
<i> Are the good rewarded</i>
<i> in the next life?</i>

01:07.467 --> 01:09.902
<i> Are the wicked punished?</i>

01:10.770 --> 01:13.772
<i> Is there anything after this?</i>

01:16.009 --> 01:17.876
<i> Fucked if I know.</i>

01:18.912 --> 01:20.913
<i> Guess I'm about to find out.</i>

01:29.622 --> 01:31.323
<i> ...body of a third girl</i>

01:31.325 --> 01:33.358
<i> has been found</i>
<i> in snowdonia national park...</i>

01:33.360 --> 01:36.929
<i> ...the police</i>
<i> are still no closer</i>
<i> to discovering the identity...</i>

01:36.931 --> 01:39.698
<i> ...six A.M. when hikers</i>
<i> came across the remains</i>

01:39.700 --> 01:41.500
<i> of 23 year old grace may...</i>

01:41.502 --> 01:42.935
<i> ...detectives are working</i>
<i> around the clock</i>

01:42.937 --> 01:44.603
<i> in the snowdonia area...</i>

03:13.494 --> 03:15.093
<i> Here in this part</i>
<i> of snowdonia,</i>

03:15.095 --> 03:17.329
<i> police have discovered</i>
<i> another body of a young woman.</i>

03:17.331 --> 03:20.199
<i> So far there's no official</i>
<i> comment from the police,</i>

03:20.201 --> 03:21.934
<i> but it's thought that</i>
<i> this could be another victim</i>

03:21.936 --> 03:23.335
<i> of the wedlock killer.</i>

03:23.337 --> 03:25.904
<i> Known for his savage</i>
<i> and brutal attacks,</i>

03:25.906 --> 03:28.006
<i> each victim has</i>
<i> their wedding finger cut off</i>

03:28.008 --> 03:29.474
<i> with bolt cutters.</i>

03:29.476 --> 03:30.542
This mysterious killer

03:30.544 --> 03:33.178
has claimed five lives
in as many months.

03:33.180 --> 03:34.680
<i> With me today</i>
<i> is officer Freeman</i>

03:34.682 --> 03:36.148
<i> from the north wales police.</i>

03:36.150 --> 03:37.950
Officer Freeman,
could this be the work

03:37.952 --> 03:39.351
of the wedlock killer?

03:39.353 --> 03:41.486
I'm afraid I'm not able
to confirm or deny

03:41.488 --> 03:44.856
that it is the wedlock killer
at this time.

03:44.858 --> 03:48.126
I'm not at Liberty to comment
on the specific circumstances

03:48.128 --> 03:51.830
of the victim's death, until
we've had a chance to complete-

05:02.702 --> 05:04.102
hello?

05:05.672 --> 05:06.905
Dad?

05:53.152 --> 05:55.287
Oh, my god...

05:56.656 --> 05:58.423
Jesus. It's you.

05:59.392 --> 06:01.026
He'll be back any second.

06:02.128 --> 06:03.628
You can't...

06:04.831 --> 06:05.831
Please don't hurt me!

07:30.717 --> 07:33.185
<i> Hi, this is Duncan slater,</i>

07:33.187 --> 07:34.953
<i> calling for Laurie wolf</i>
<i> about the presenter job</i>

07:34.955 --> 07:37.155
<i> at cruise radio.</i>
<i> We got your demo tape.</i>

07:37.157 --> 07:39.024
<i> We didn't realize you were</i>
<i>actually gonna send it on tape.</i>

07:39.026 --> 07:40.892
<i> Nice touch, very retro.</i>

07:40.894 --> 07:42.494
<i> There's some good stuff</i>
<i> on there...</i>

07:42.496 --> 07:44.696
<i> Listen, if it was up to me</i>

07:44.698 --> 07:46.531
<i> you'd be heading up</i>
<i> our new breakfast show,</i>

07:46.533 --> 07:48.800
<i> but it hasn't worked out</i>
<i> this time. Maybe if--</i>

07:48.802 --> 07:50.368
<i> message deleted.</i>

07:50.370 --> 07:52.604
<i> Hi there,</i>
<i> Maggie from prestige here.</i>

07:52.606 --> 07:55.440
<i> I really like your showreel,</i>
<i> it's so funny.</i>

07:55.442 --> 07:57.976
<i> Sorry though, a bit edgy</i>
<i> for our listeners.</i>

07:57.978 --> 08:00.212
<i> Have you tried cruise?</i>
<i> They'll love you over--</i>

08:00.214 --> 08:00.212
<i> message deleted.</i>

08:00.214 --> 08:04.149
<i> Hiya, its Ben. Obviously...</i>

08:04.151 --> 08:06.117
<i> So, the final show.</i>

08:06.119 --> 08:08.186
<i> End of an era and all that.</i>

08:08.188 --> 08:09.654
<i> Please try</i>
<i> and be on time tonight.</i>

08:09.656 --> 08:11.022
<i> Some of us</i>
<i> would actually like--</i>

08:11.024 --> 08:13.625
<i> message deleted.</i>

08:13.627 --> 08:15.494
<i> What a perfect setting</i>

08:15.496 --> 08:16.761
<i> for a spine-tingling</i>
<i> ghost story.</i>

08:16.763 --> 08:19.931
Marek! Turn down the TV.

08:19.933 --> 08:23.969
<i> Actually this is</i>
<i> a ghost story...</i>

08:23.971 --> 08:27.138
<i>...but one with a difference...</i>

08:27.140 --> 08:31.810
<i> ...one you must pay</i>
<i> strict attention to.</i>

08:31.812 --> 08:33.611
<i> Every Halloween,</i>

08:33.614 --> 08:35.113
<i> Eleanor the ghost</i>

08:35.115 --> 08:38.149
<i> rises from her grave</i>
<i> to meet her friends.</i>

08:38.150 --> 08:40.352
Marek, it's too loud, sweetie.

08:40.354 --> 08:41.753
<i> Together, they will go about</i>

08:41.755 --> 08:43.989
<i> their ghostly business...</i>

08:43.991 --> 08:45.757
Medicine time.

08:46.526 --> 08:48.059
Here you go.

08:48.061 --> 08:51.796
<i> ...but this year,</i>
<i> something was different.</i>

08:51.798 --> 08:53.131
<i> This year...</i>

08:56.936 --> 08:58.970
It's Saturday,
miss komisarczyk.

08:58.972 --> 09:01.172
Just one more day.
That's all I need.

09:01.174 --> 09:03.308
You've already used up
all the bank's good will.

09:03.310 --> 09:06.011
Just another 24 hours.

09:06.013 --> 09:09.214
What difference
does a day make?

09:12.518 --> 09:15.120
Okay... the TV for starters.

09:15.122 --> 09:17.589
<i> You silly ghost,</i>
<i> you've missed it by a day-</i>

09:31.871 --> 09:33.038
- hiya.
- Hi.

09:33.040 --> 09:34.839
It's not the best time
right now.

09:34.841 --> 09:36.942
Oh. Everything all right?

09:36.944 --> 09:38.710
Yeah, just...

09:38.712 --> 09:40.045
Never mind.

09:40.047 --> 09:42.113
Well, you look lovely.

09:42.115 --> 09:44.549
I suppose you are going out
with him again, are you?

09:44.551 --> 09:46.184
What can I say?

09:46.186 --> 09:50.121
He's a real person,
not just a face on a screen.

09:50.123 --> 09:51.222
I'm real.

09:51.224 --> 09:53.058
I've only got
your word for that.

09:53.060 --> 09:55.727
It was you who said it would
be a bad idea to meet up.

09:55.729 --> 09:57.796
I'm full of bad ideas.

09:57.798 --> 09:59.397
Anyway,
it's the last show tonight.

09:59.399 --> 10:01.466
Remember you'll need
an old analogue radio.

10:01.468 --> 10:02.767
Okay, I will try,

10:02.769 --> 10:04.970
but I'm not promising anything.

10:04.972 --> 10:07.305
You'll miss
my technical expertise.

10:07.307 --> 10:09.207
Is that bitch still presenting?

10:09.209 --> 10:11.843
That bitch is the best
in the north wales area.

10:11.845 --> 10:14.579
Not exactly a claim to fame.

10:14.581 --> 10:16.748
I just wouldn't know
what to say to her

10:16.750 --> 10:18.216
if I ever met her.

10:18.218 --> 10:20.118
Well, I wouldn't
hold your breath there.

10:20.120 --> 10:22.253
Anyway, look, just promise me
you'll text me-

10:22.255 --> 10:23.455
hi.

10:25.091 --> 10:26.358
Who's that?

10:26.360 --> 10:27.759
No one.

10:31.831 --> 10:33.732
Looked like a handsome no one
to me.

10:34.867 --> 10:36.468
Just an online friend.

10:39.238 --> 10:41.873
You should to be careful who
you make friends with online.

10:43.476 --> 10:45.076
Bunch of bloody freaks
out there.

10:46.379 --> 10:48.446
Well, I guess
that's goodbye then.

10:53.619 --> 10:54.552
Where's your TV?

10:54.554 --> 10:56.588
He watches too much anyway.

10:58.424 --> 11:01.092
Not everyone has something
to fall back on.

11:01.094 --> 11:03.194
I built that PR company up
from nothing.

11:04.130 --> 11:05.830
It's not my fault
I'm a success.

11:05.832 --> 11:07.298
Sorry...

11:07.833 --> 11:09.467
I'm just...

11:09.469 --> 11:10.902
...in a corner.

11:10.904 --> 11:12.137
Hey...

11:13.139 --> 11:14.272
Hey.

11:15.841 --> 11:17.175
Tonight's gonna
change all that.

11:17.177 --> 11:18.943
I need to tell you something.

11:19.945 --> 11:21.746
I'm not sure I can do that.

11:24.617 --> 11:25.750
Okay.

11:27.086 --> 11:28.219
Okay.

11:29.055 --> 11:30.355
I get it.

11:31.791 --> 11:33.224
Maybe your situation's
not that bad.

11:33.226 --> 11:35.326
No, no, it's not that.

11:35.328 --> 11:36.761
I just...

11:37.797 --> 11:39.798
I don't know if I'm capable.

11:41.967 --> 11:43.535
When the shit hits the fan...

11:44.670 --> 11:47.238
...you'd be amazed of what
human beings are capable of.

11:47.240 --> 11:48.807
Incredible stuff.

11:48.809 --> 11:50.008
Not me.

11:51.010 --> 11:52.077
We'll see.

11:52.712 --> 11:54.379
You think I'm incredible?

11:55.047 --> 11:56.314
I think you're okay.

12:00.753 --> 12:02.020
Well, um...

12:03.089 --> 12:05.790
I'll see you later, yeah?
And...

12:05.792 --> 12:07.525
...don't forget the stuff
on that list.

12:07.527 --> 12:08.960
Yeah.

12:38.724 --> 12:40.425
Sorry. Come in.

12:42.027 --> 12:44.596
How is our little prince
this evening?

12:44.598 --> 12:45.897
Living room.

12:45.899 --> 12:48.099
Cartoons again?

12:48.101 --> 12:50.135
Hope he's off
before my soaps start.

12:50.137 --> 12:54.139
Um... yeah, about that...
Um...

12:55.876 --> 12:57.542
Oh.

12:58.344 --> 13:01.179
I always did prefer the radio.

13:01.181 --> 13:03.982
Ooh! You going away
for a week?

13:03.984 --> 13:06.618
No, it's just some stuff
i need to take.

13:06.620 --> 13:07.685
I thought you were gonna
watch your friend

13:07.687 --> 13:09.187
record a radio show.

14:00.873 --> 14:02.540
Where's the jag?

14:02.542 --> 14:03.908
It's in the garage.

14:03.910 --> 14:05.376
Had to get the bus here.

14:06.612 --> 14:08.880
Let's just get started, yeah?

14:30.336 --> 14:32.337
We are really going to do this?

14:32.339 --> 14:35.073
You make it sound so ominous.

14:35.075 --> 14:37.909
Such a good girl,
aren't you?

14:37.911 --> 14:40.612
I just don't understand why you
can't ask him for the money,

14:40.614 --> 14:42.280
or take him to court.

14:42.282 --> 14:44.315
You've met
loads of footballers.

14:44.317 --> 14:45.617
You know what they're like.

14:51.557 --> 14:53.758
I have never done
anything like this before.

14:53.760 --> 14:56.628
Shit, you're gonna to sit
on your arse for 10 minutes.

14:56.630 --> 14:58.997
You're turning it into
<i> ocean's eleven.</i>

14:58.999 --> 15:01.566
But what happens when this guy
realizes that you're try-

15:01.568 --> 15:02.867
Kate, Kate.

15:02.869 --> 15:05.203
You know how much money
he earns a week.

15:05.205 --> 15:07.839
40 grand's like monopoly money
to him.

15:07.841 --> 15:09.674
Besides, it's not like
we're stealing.

15:09.676 --> 15:11.209
He owes me this.

15:16.482 --> 15:19.918
What am I looking for?

15:19.920 --> 15:21.185
The middle of nowhere.

15:21.187 --> 15:23.721
And yet you felt like
you needed a look-out?

15:23.723 --> 15:25.189
Okay, I'm gonna be honest
with you.

15:26.325 --> 15:28.293
There's this one old farmer
might show up, right?

15:28.295 --> 15:30.395
The fields around the house
are owned by this farmer.

15:30.397 --> 15:31.362
Right? He's a busy bastard.

15:31.364 --> 15:34.098
He's harmless but he owns
the private road.

15:34.100 --> 15:35.900
So if he shows up,
just get rid of him...

15:35.902 --> 15:37.168
...pronto.

15:37.170 --> 15:38.536
Think of something.

15:38.538 --> 15:40.038
Earn your money.

15:40.040 --> 15:41.773
T-tell him his sheep
have escaped,

15:41.775 --> 15:43.274
or... there's a fox,

15:43.276 --> 15:44.509
that's just stupid.

15:44.511 --> 15:45.944
Think of something better.

16:09.368 --> 16:10.969
Where's the torch?

16:11.637 --> 16:12.904
What the fuck are they?

16:12.906 --> 16:15.873
Survival glow sticks.
Army issue.

16:15.875 --> 16:18.309
No batteries needed.
Just snap them and go.

16:18.311 --> 16:20.044
- That's fucking genius.
- Yeah.

16:20.046 --> 16:21.913
Except how do I turn them off...

16:23.215 --> 16:24.782
...in case
i don't wanna be seen?

16:36.161 --> 16:38.396
I don't remember putting
shit-old radio on the list.

16:38.398 --> 16:40.531
That's just in case
i get bored.

16:40.533 --> 16:41.799
What's wrong with that one?

16:41.801 --> 16:43.101
It's broken.

16:50.242 --> 16:52.210
Stop worryin'.

17:13.832 --> 17:15.465
Okay, okay, stop here.

17:15.468 --> 17:16.634
- Where?
- Just here.

17:16.636 --> 17:18.069
Just here. Stop.

17:22.242 --> 17:23.574
Now what?

17:24.877 --> 17:26.243
Now we wait.

18:25.337 --> 18:26.704
Oh, come on, come on...

18:47.559 --> 18:49.861
<i> It's time to get</i>
<i> that Friday feeling</i>

18:49.863 --> 18:51.496
<i> on jab</i>

18:51.498 --> 18:54.031
<i> and howl at the moon</i>
<i> with Laurie wolf.</i>

18:56.069 --> 18:57.969
Welcome, cub pack.

18:57.971 --> 19:00.304
It's me, Laurie wolf.

19:01.240 --> 19:03.040
As regular listeners
of the show will know,

19:03.042 --> 19:05.209
this is our last night on air.

19:05.211 --> 19:08.379
It's all
been centralized, folks.

19:08.381 --> 19:11.182
No longer do you have to be
bored by your local news,

19:11.184 --> 19:12.917
community and issues,

19:12.919 --> 19:16.154
you can find out what's
going on in the real world,

19:16.156 --> 19:19.023
like London or Cardiff.

19:20.193 --> 19:21.325
I have...

19:22.294 --> 19:26.230
...a list of songs
approved by the station...

19:26.232 --> 19:28.466
...but I'm sure you've
heard them all before.

19:32.404 --> 19:35.473
After six years
of playing shit

19:35.475 --> 19:37.375
other people want me to play,

19:37.377 --> 19:39.644
I'm going to spend
just one night playing music

19:39.646 --> 19:40.878
I want to listen to,

19:40.880 --> 19:42.680
because you know...

19:42.682 --> 19:44.715
...i am a dj.

19:44.717 --> 19:47.652
Stick with me if you dare.

20:03.368 --> 20:05.970
Yeah, lovely.
Can we maybe...

20:05.972 --> 20:08.039
...tone the language down?
Maybe?

20:08.041 --> 20:10.208
Please? Please?!

20:10.210 --> 20:13.244
We're on delay!
Just cut it out, genius.

20:14.513 --> 20:16.414
We are taping this, aren't we?

20:16.416 --> 20:19.717
Haven't used tape for 20 years,
but... yeah.

20:35.935 --> 20:37.568
Okay.

20:37.570 --> 20:38.869
Game time.

20:39.371 --> 20:40.538
Can you hold those?

20:41.406 --> 20:43.674
What they have a big dog,
or something?

20:43.676 --> 20:46.844
Didn't you say marek needs
an operation, or something?

20:46.846 --> 20:47.912
Yeah.

20:47.914 --> 20:50.047
So just sit there,
do nothing,

20:50.049 --> 20:51.349
listen to your
piece of shit radio,

20:51.351 --> 20:53.317
and count to 20,000
in your head.

20:53.319 --> 20:54.452
I'll be back
before you can blink,

20:54.454 --> 20:55.720
and have a bag full of
something better

20:55.722 --> 20:57.788
than fucking glow sticks.

21:42.234 --> 21:44.168
Hi, it's Janet.

21:44.170 --> 21:45.336
<i> Hi. Put him on.</i>

21:45.338 --> 21:47.538
Okay.
It's your mum.

21:48.473 --> 21:50.041
Hi, sweetie.

21:50.043 --> 21:51.409
Bed time now.

21:52.745 --> 21:54.945
<i> I want you to go to sleep,</i>

21:54.947 --> 21:58.716
and I want you to think
about nice things.

21:58.718 --> 21:59.684
Because...

22:00.519 --> 22:03.287
Because tomorrow,
when you wake up...

22:04.222 --> 22:07.391
...things are going to be
different for us.

22:08.860 --> 22:10.895
<i> We just need to be strong.</i>

22:11.930 --> 22:13.764
<i> We'll get through this.</i>

22:15.100 --> 22:17.001
Just one more night, and...

22:17.003 --> 22:18.769
...we can start all over again.

22:18.771 --> 22:20.237
Okay?

22:23.542 --> 22:25.810
<i> Oh, don't worry.</i>
<i> He's in good hands.</i>

22:25.812 --> 22:28.212
I know.
Thanks, Janet.

23:03.749 --> 23:05.816
Yep, we're on air,
actually, so...

23:05.818 --> 23:07.385
Shall I call back later?

23:07.387 --> 23:09.186
Nope, you've got
'til the end of the track.

23:09.188 --> 23:10.187
You listening?

23:10.189 --> 23:12.189
Yeah! Great show so far.

23:12.191 --> 23:14.191
<i> We've only been on 60 seconds.</i>
<i> But thanks.</i>

23:14.193 --> 23:16.660
<i> Is this on the cd</i>
<i> you made me?</i>

23:16.662 --> 23:19.263
Yes. Yes, it is.

23:19.265 --> 23:20.531
Did you like it?

23:20.533 --> 23:22.666
Yeah. Got some good stuff
on it.

23:22.668 --> 23:24.535
Bollocks. It's got
some great stuff on it.

23:24.537 --> 23:26.771
Track two is amazeballs.

23:26.773 --> 23:28.272
Anyway, what's up?

23:28.274 --> 23:30.007
Why do you say that?

23:30.009 --> 23:33.344
Because you called me.
Something's definitely up.

23:52.531 --> 23:54.265
Um... here's an idea.

23:54.267 --> 23:56.367
Why don't you come here?

23:56.369 --> 23:57.835
I'm busy.

23:57.837 --> 24:00.905
<i> Whatever it is,</i>
<i> just walk away.</i>

24:00.907 --> 24:03.107
<i> Come on, we can have our own</i>
<i> little mini party here.</i>

24:03.109 --> 24:05.209
We're gonna have a psychic on.
Should be fun.

24:05.211 --> 24:06.744
She's really good.

24:07.546 --> 24:08.979
Maybe.

24:08.981 --> 24:10.481
Oh, gotta go.
Song's ending.

24:10.483 --> 24:12.249
Busy, busy.

24:12.251 --> 24:13.517
Bye.

24:50.722 --> 24:52.356
It's just after nine P.M.

24:52.358 --> 24:54.658
On the 16th of September,

24:54.660 --> 24:58.162
and I can already tell you that
tomorrow is going to suck...

24:58.164 --> 24:59.363
...hard.

24:59.365 --> 25:00.698
<i> So why not</i>
<i> stay up all night</i>

25:00.700 --> 25:03.000
<i> and forget</i>
<i> about tomorrow altogether?</i>

25:04.570 --> 25:07.137
God, I'm such a mess.

25:52.918 --> 25:54.852
What's got you so excited?

25:54.854 --> 25:56.453
Uh... she's here.

25:57.489 --> 26:00.624
Careful. Don't wanna give her
the wrong idea.

26:03.395 --> 26:05.763
Hi! Uh... ciao.

26:05.765 --> 26:07.298
Ciao.

26:07.300 --> 26:09.800
Can you help me with my stuff?
- Of course.

26:09.802 --> 26:10.968
Thank you.

26:10.970 --> 26:12.803
I have to say
I'm a massive fan.

26:12.805 --> 26:13.837
I've got all your books.

26:13.839 --> 26:16.307
Yeah? I'll sign both of them
if you like.

26:16.309 --> 26:18.375
Oh, watch your step up here.

26:18.377 --> 26:20.377
This place can be
a bit of a death trap.

26:20.379 --> 26:21.645
Building's a bit rickety.

26:21.647 --> 26:25.282
Used to be a world war two
communications outpost.

26:25.284 --> 26:26.650
I hope that doesn't
put you off,

26:26.652 --> 26:27.818
you being Italian and all.

26:27.820 --> 26:29.219
Ah, no, don't worry.

26:29.221 --> 26:31.956
My father was partigiano.
- Partigiano?

26:31.958 --> 26:33.824
Yes, partigiano
against Mussolini.

26:33.826 --> 26:36.026
Oh, thank god for that.
This way.

26:36.028 --> 26:37.161
Okay.

26:38.296 --> 26:42.333
So, you actually talk
to the dead and stuff?

26:42.335 --> 26:43.934
Amongst other talents.

26:44.836 --> 26:46.403
So have you ever spoken
to anyone famous,

26:46.405 --> 26:48.639
like, um...

26:48.641 --> 26:52.376
...marilyn Monroe
or genghis kahn
or someone like that?

26:52.378 --> 26:57.147
No. The afterlife...
It's not like chat show.

26:57.149 --> 26:59.383
Oh... well, that's a pity,
isn't it?

27:01.953 --> 27:03.253
Watch your step right there.

27:03.255 --> 27:06.223
So, this is where
the magic happens.

27:06.225 --> 27:08.158
Have you fixed the antenna?

27:08.160 --> 27:09.159
We don't want it crapping up

27:09.161 --> 27:10.961
in the middle
of our triumphant last show.

27:10.963 --> 27:13.430
Yep. Did it before you arrived.

27:13.432 --> 27:15.466
Oh, you're on the ball.

27:15.468 --> 27:16.367
I know.

27:17.469 --> 27:21.772
Stay tuned, because later
we have "Carla the psychic".

27:21.774 --> 27:23.207
She's going to be telling us

27:23.209 --> 27:25.309
what our futures
have in store for us.

27:25.311 --> 27:28.312
Spoiler alert:
I don't have one.

27:35.687 --> 27:37.054
Shit.

27:37.622 --> 27:38.789
Great.

27:42.160 --> 27:43.460
Shit.

28:20.665 --> 28:21.932
What are you doing
stuck out here

28:21.934 --> 28:23.901
in the middle of the night,
huh?

28:23.903 --> 28:25.169
You must be freezing.

28:25.171 --> 28:28.439
My boyfriend, he will be back
in a minute.

28:29.441 --> 28:31.875
- You here for Sarah?
- Sarah?

28:31.877 --> 28:33.877
My daughter,
'cause she's not here.

28:33.879 --> 28:36.947
'Course all I get it
a post-it note on the fridge

28:36.949 --> 28:38.816
saying she'll be away
for a week.

28:38.818 --> 28:42.152
Gone to see Becky--
- I don't know here. Sorry.

28:42.154 --> 28:43.153
Ah.

28:44.689 --> 28:48.525
Anyway, you shouldn't be
out here on your own
in the middle of the night.

28:48.527 --> 28:50.594
You don't watch the news, no?

28:52.597 --> 28:54.364
He's gone for petrol.

28:54.999 --> 28:56.467
He won't be long.

28:57.869 --> 28:59.236
When'll he be back?

29:00.171 --> 29:02.372
Sorry, have we done
something wrong?

29:02.374 --> 29:05.175
Well, you're parked
on my property.

29:05.177 --> 29:06.877
We were lost...

29:07.612 --> 29:08.879
Well...

29:10.148 --> 29:11.381
I'll tell you what.

29:12.117 --> 29:14.418
Why don't you get in my truck

29:14.420 --> 29:16.453
and we'll go look for him?

29:17.155 --> 29:18.756
He can't have gone far.

29:18.758 --> 29:21.225
He won't be long.
You must be busy.

29:21.227 --> 29:23.594
I've got plenty of petrol
back at the farm.

29:26.931 --> 29:29.333
You're not trying to get rid
of me, are you?

29:29.335 --> 29:30.901
No, of course not.

29:33.304 --> 29:34.605
Good.

29:36.875 --> 29:41.178
I'll just stay here and...
Keep you company.

29:41.180 --> 29:42.479
Okay.

29:43.915 --> 29:45.649
Until he gets back.

29:57.028 --> 29:58.095
How's it going?

29:58.097 --> 29:58.095
Peachy.

29:58.097 --> 30:02.399
Ready to break out the joss
sticks and start chanting.

30:02.401 --> 30:03.634
All right, one:

30:03.636 --> 30:03.634
You know how I feel about fur.

30:03.636 --> 30:07.137
Can we remove the stoat
from the work area please?

30:07.139 --> 30:08.972
And two: Can you try and keep
an open mind,

30:08.974 --> 30:10.274
for me, today, please?

30:10.276 --> 30:12.643
Hey, I'm the rational one.

30:12.645 --> 30:14.478
This was your idea.

30:14.480 --> 30:16.647
Excuse me if I can't ignore
the last 200 years

30:16.649 --> 30:18.148
of science and philosophy.

30:18.150 --> 30:19.483
You know she's a giant
in her field, don't you?

30:19.485 --> 30:21.552
Too bad her field
is filled with horse shit.

30:21.554 --> 30:24.388
Try and have a bit of respect,
will you?

30:24.390 --> 30:25.823
Respect?

30:25.825 --> 30:28.625
Respect is for doctors,
teachers and charity workers,

30:28.627 --> 30:31.795
not for charlatans preying
on the emotionally unstable.

30:31.797 --> 30:33.630
I'm not emotionally unstable.

30:33.632 --> 30:35.232
That's a matter of opinion.

30:35.234 --> 30:37.267
Let's just say I represent

30:37.269 --> 30:42.039
the sensible, sane, rational
listeners, and you represent...

30:43.908 --> 30:45.409
...the rest of the freaks.

30:45.411 --> 30:47.444
Thanks.

30:47.446 --> 30:48.579
Hey!

30:49.814 --> 30:51.481
You can have them back
at the end of the show.

31:16.808 --> 31:18.542
Cold night to be out.

31:18.544 --> 31:19.810
I'm okay.

31:19.812 --> 31:24.448
He's not coming back, you know.

31:25.717 --> 31:28.552
There isn't a petrol station
or village...

31:28.554 --> 31:30.420
...for miles 'round here.

31:32.690 --> 31:35.325
Looks like you're stuck
with me.

31:35.327 --> 31:38.762
He... said he would be
right back.

31:39.831 --> 31:42.666
I think we both know
that's a lie.

31:42.668 --> 31:45.869
I think it'll be best
if you came to mine.

31:45.871 --> 31:47.037
Get in the car.

31:47.039 --> 31:51.308
Really, I think I should
be here when he gets back.

31:51.310 --> 31:52.976
Well, phone him.

31:52.978 --> 31:54.378
No signal.

31:54.380 --> 31:55.412
Huh.

31:56.014 --> 31:58.015
Not your lucky day, is it?

31:58.017 --> 31:59.416
Come on.

31:59.418 --> 32:01.652
I-i can't, I...

32:05.323 --> 32:07.791
I'm sorry.
I-i didn't realize.

32:07.793 --> 32:09.159
It's fine.

32:09.161 --> 32:11.962
I can go to the farm
and get some petrol.

32:11.964 --> 32:14.197
Really. It's not a problem.

32:14.199 --> 32:16.099
Ah, this is him now.

32:16.101 --> 32:17.734
I thought you couldn't
get a signal.

32:17.736 --> 32:20.504
I guess it's in and out.

32:20.506 --> 32:23.340
Hi darling. Have you found
the petrol station?

32:23.342 --> 32:24.741
What are you talking about?

32:24.743 --> 32:26.677
You have? Fantastic!

32:26.679 --> 32:28.578
Are you on your way back?

32:28.580 --> 32:30.180
Is someone there?

32:30.182 --> 32:31.782
Uh-huh, yeah,
i have been befriended

32:31.784 --> 32:34.284
by some kind man.
It's okay.

32:34.286 --> 32:36.053
Shit. Get rid of him.

32:36.055 --> 32:37.354
Yep. I will.

32:37.356 --> 32:40.257
I haven't got the money yet.
Get fucking rid of him now.

32:40.259 --> 32:42.526
He says thanks
for looking after me.

32:46.698 --> 32:48.332
Guess I better be on my way.

32:48.334 --> 32:49.633
Thank you so much.

32:49.635 --> 32:51.668
You've come out of your way
for me.

32:51.670 --> 32:53.470
Oh, not really.

32:53.472 --> 32:54.671
I just live there.

32:55.506 --> 32:57.307
Only house 'round here
for miles.

32:59.611 --> 33:00.577
There?

33:01.412 --> 33:03.814
Well, I hope it all
works out okay.

33:03.816 --> 33:05.082
But-

33:06.718 --> 33:08.485
w-wait.

33:09.287 --> 33:10.587
Kate.

33:10.955 --> 33:12.322
Kate!

33:12.324 --> 33:14.291
Nick has something to say.

33:16.027 --> 33:18.895
My boyfriend says that
there's a fence down, uh...

33:18.897 --> 33:20.364
...three miles from here.

33:20.366 --> 33:22.332
Sheep everywhere.

33:22.334 --> 33:22.332
Where?

33:22.334 --> 33:26.536
Just a few miles
over that hill.

33:26.538 --> 33:28.872
That's Bryn William's land.
- Kate.

33:28.874 --> 33:30.807
<i> He said it's quite bad.</i>

33:30.809 --> 33:33.343
Um, a car ran over a few

33:33.345 --> 33:34.911
and killed them.

33:35.680 --> 33:37.147
I suppose I can go
and have a look.

33:37.149 --> 33:38.815
I'm here anyway.

33:38.817 --> 33:40.884
He'd do the same for me.

33:43.788 --> 33:45.789
Thanks for your help.

33:48.260 --> 33:51.962
Okay, mind explaining
what the fuck is going on?

33:51.964 --> 33:53.163
<i> What are you talking about?</i>

33:53.165 --> 33:55.298
Whose house is it
that you're in?

33:55.300 --> 33:57.067
Sweetheart, I told you.

33:57.069 --> 33:58.902
Stop lying to me!

33:58.904 --> 34:00.103
I'm not.

34:00.105 --> 34:02.139
<i> Stop overreacting.</i>

34:02.141 --> 34:05.409
I'm nearly done.
I'll see you soon, okay?

34:18.824 --> 34:19.956
Can I pop these on your ears?

34:19.958 --> 34:22.359
- No, thanks.
- Okay.

34:23.929 --> 34:27.130
<i> You're listening</i>
<i> to jab radio,</i>

34:27.132 --> 34:29.766
<i> sound of snowdonia.</i>

34:31.437 --> 34:35.304
I'm very excited to introduce
the... exotic Carla,

34:35.306 --> 34:37.574
who's travelled over five miles
from bangor

34:37.576 --> 34:39.643
to join us tonight.

34:39.645 --> 34:43.146
She's going to predict
our futures.

34:45.083 --> 34:47.350
I'm guessing you are not
a believer.

34:47.351 --> 34:49.853
No! Fascinated.

34:49.855 --> 34:52.089
I really think...

34:52.091 --> 34:53.757
...you're the most
exciting guest

34:53.759 --> 34:55.292
we've got on tonight.

34:59.197 --> 35:03.467
Lots of people have a problem
with what I do.

35:03.469 --> 35:07.871
I'm often accused
of exploiting the vulnerable.

35:07.873 --> 35:11.741
But it's not about money,
but consciousness.

35:11.743 --> 35:15.879
The ability to tune
into your environment.

35:15.881 --> 35:19.082
So, tune into here.

35:19.084 --> 35:21.284
Us, now.

35:31.329 --> 35:33.597
For you, Ben...

35:35.900 --> 35:38.335
...i see much responsibility.

35:40.405 --> 35:44.341
And Laurie, for you it's...

35:44.343 --> 35:46.076
...it's harder to see.

35:49.247 --> 35:50.647
It's misty.

35:59.791 --> 36:02.092
I can sense a dark presence.

36:05.830 --> 36:10.433
A voice crying in the darkness.

36:10.435 --> 36:11.935
In the darkness.

36:13.037 --> 36:14.771
I'm not sure where...

36:17.441 --> 36:20.644
...but the voice
is reaching out to us.

36:22.780 --> 36:25.749
Something terrible
has happened.

36:31.856 --> 36:34.658
So... just to re-cap...

36:34.660 --> 36:36.459
...something terrible
is happening

36:36.461 --> 36:39.362
somewhere in the world
right now.

36:39.364 --> 36:40.964
Can't be sure where.

36:40.966 --> 36:43.867
Sorry we can't be
more specific.

37:23.674 --> 37:25.075
Hello?

37:26.644 --> 37:28.445
Is anyone there?

37:30.147 --> 37:31.815
Oh, fuck.

37:42.059 --> 37:43.793
<i> Hi, you've got</i>
<i> the voicemail of Nick Keller.</i>

37:43.795 --> 37:45.428
<i> I can't take your call</i>
<i> right now,</i>

37:45.430 --> 37:47.564
<i> but if you leave me a message</i>
<i> I'll call you back.</i>

37:47.566 --> 37:48.898
Shit.

38:31.108 --> 38:33.410
You're fucking kidding me!

38:41.852 --> 38:43.386
Come on.

38:43.388 --> 38:45.155
<i> Hi, you've got</i>
<i> the voicemail of Nick Keller.</i>

38:45.157 --> 38:47.157
<i> I can't take your call</i>
<i> right now, but if you leave-</i>

38:50.262 --> 38:51.695
come on.

39:02.807 --> 39:04.674
<i> It's the midnight hour show.</i>

39:04.676 --> 39:06.309
<i> Jab radio.</i>

39:06.311 --> 39:07.644
<i> That was for those of you</i>

39:07.646 --> 39:10.547
<i> still with us at this hour.</i>

39:10.549 --> 39:12.716
<i> We're half way</i>
<i> through the night.</i>

39:12.718 --> 39:15.452
<i> So keep drinking</i>
<i> that extra strength coffee</i>

39:15.454 --> 39:18.321
<i> and follow us until dawn.</i>

39:18.323 --> 39:20.523
<i> It's our final ever show,</i>

39:20.525 --> 39:23.526
<i> so it's your last chance</i>
<i> to hear some decent music</i>

39:23.528 --> 39:25.228
<i> on these airwaves.</i>

39:25.863 --> 39:28.932
Speaking of which,

39:28.934 --> 39:34.337
now it's time for
a blast from the past.

39:45.951 --> 39:50.120
<i> I'm very excited to introduce</i>
<i> the exotic Carla...</i>

39:50.122 --> 39:51.988
She is always like this?

39:53.057 --> 39:56.626
Oh no. Normally we have to be
a little more... safe.

39:56.628 --> 39:58.862
I guess she thinks she's got
nothing to lose.

39:59.930 --> 40:01.965
What are you doing?

40:01.967 --> 40:04.234
There is a light delay
on the show.

40:04.236 --> 40:07.370
Gives me the opportunity
to fade out quick if...

40:07.372 --> 40:09.072
...madam in there swears...

40:09.074 --> 40:10.206
...or a quest explodes.

40:11.643 --> 40:13.643
<i> ...crying in the darkness.</i>

40:15.013 --> 40:16.146
Wait a moment.

40:17.582 --> 40:18.915
Go back.

40:18.917 --> 40:18.915
Okay.

40:18.917 --> 40:23.486
<i> ...a voice crying</i>
<i> in the darkness.</i>

40:24.389 --> 40:25.889
- There?
- Again.

40:25.891 --> 40:29.359
<i> ...a voice crying</i>
<i> in the darkness.</i>

40:31.296 --> 40:32.362
There.

40:32.364 --> 40:34.197
Interference or something.

40:34.199 --> 40:35.932
<i> Ancora.</i> Again.

40:37.168 --> 40:40.503
<i> ...a voice crying</i>
<i> in the darkness.</i>

40:43.974 --> 40:45.742
What does that sound like
to you?

40:47.812 --> 40:49.612
Tell you what.
Let me clean that up a bit.

40:52.183 --> 40:55.885
So, what's her problem?

40:56.787 --> 41:00.423
Oh, she's not that bad really.

41:00.425 --> 41:02.826
I didn't like to say on air

41:02.828 --> 41:06.396
when I was reading her but,
i saw...

41:06.398 --> 41:09.732
...a lot of pain in her past.

41:09.734 --> 41:11.401
Oh, the singer
on this track now.

41:11.403 --> 41:13.269
- Yeah?
- That's her.

41:16.274 --> 41:18.274
She's got a great voice.

41:18.276 --> 41:20.543
- Mm-hm.
- What happened?

41:21.645 --> 41:24.180
Some crazy ex.
Years ago now.

41:25.282 --> 41:28.184
She gave up her career for him,
was having his kid,

41:28.186 --> 41:31.454
he was less than thrilled
by the news.

41:31.456 --> 41:34.224
He wanted her
to get an abortion?

41:35.292 --> 41:37.293
No, no, he, um...

41:37.295 --> 41:38.628
...stuck an ice pick in her neck

41:38.630 --> 41:41.097
and threw her down
a flight of stairs.

41:41.099 --> 41:42.632
She was lucky.

41:42.634 --> 41:44.734
Well, no, not really,
but, um...

41:44.736 --> 41:45.735
...she survived.

41:45.737 --> 41:47.170
She lost her baby?

41:47.172 --> 41:47.170
Mm-hm.

41:48.839 --> 41:51.508
Took her a whole year
to relearn how to speak...

41:51.510 --> 41:53.109
...but she'll never sing again.

41:53.911 --> 41:55.712
But she's okay.

41:55.714 --> 41:57.814
He's doing a life stretch
in dartmoor.

42:02.921 --> 42:04.187
Yeah...

42:05.323 --> 42:06.689
What is that?

42:36.654 --> 42:38.321
<i> Hi, you've got the voicemail</i>
<i> of Nick Keller.</i>

42:38.323 --> 42:39.522
<i> I can't take your call</i>
<i> right now,</i>

42:39.524 --> 42:40.890
<i> but if you leave me a mess-</i>

42:48.432 --> 42:49.799
hello?

42:58.876 --> 43:01.945
Nick, stop messing around
and get in the car.

43:06.283 --> 43:07.550
Nick.

43:12.489 --> 43:14.591
Let's get out of here.

43:15.626 --> 43:16.859
Nick.

43:20.030 --> 43:21.297
Nick!

43:52.396 --> 43:55.064
What the fuck?

44:03.341 --> 44:05.375
Laurie, we need you
in here now.

44:09.880 --> 44:11.381
Right, listen.

44:11.383 --> 44:13.149
This is gonna sound crazy.

44:13.151 --> 44:13.149
- Thrill me.
- Right.

44:13.151 --> 44:15.985
You know that piece
you just did with Carla?

44:15.987 --> 44:17.053
- Yeah.
- Right.

44:17.055 --> 44:18.421
There was something weird. Okay?

44:18.423 --> 44:19.455
Carla spotted it.

44:19.457 --> 44:20.790
So I run it
through the computer,

44:20.792 --> 44:22.959
put it into sound factory,
filtered out the distortion.

44:22.961 --> 44:24.727
So I'm filtering,
and filtering, and filtering--

44:24.729 --> 44:25.995
yeah, I get the idea.

44:25.997 --> 44:27.964
Anyway, blah, blah, blah,
technical shit,

44:27.966 --> 44:29.599
and we get... this.

44:29.601 --> 44:32.702
<i> ...voice crying</i>
<i> in the darkness...</i>

44:34.472 --> 44:36.139
<i> Oh, god.</i>

44:37.441 --> 44:40.643
<i> Jesus... it's you.</i>

44:42.513 --> 44:44.247
<i> He'll be back any minute.</i>

44:45.549 --> 44:48.918
<i> Please... don't hurt me.</i>

44:50.354 --> 44:52.588
<i> Please... don't hurt me.</i>

44:52.590 --> 44:55.091
You're just picking up a radio
play from another channel,

44:55.093 --> 44:56.659
or kids playing with an old cb.

44:56.661 --> 44:58.628
No, I eliminated all that.

44:58.630 --> 45:00.863
This stuff was broadcast...

45:00.865 --> 45:02.298
...if you can call it that...

45:02.300 --> 45:04.100
...from here.

45:06.670 --> 45:08.471
How is that possible?

45:08.473 --> 45:09.806
It's not.

45:09.808 --> 45:12.141
So, what do you want me
to do about it?

45:13.077 --> 45:16.379
We think we can make contact.

45:16.381 --> 45:17.747
Make contact?

45:17.749 --> 45:19.015
With the beyond.

45:19.017 --> 45:21.184
We've got this idea. Right?
It's called evp.

45:21.186 --> 45:23.086
Electronic voice phenomena.

45:23.088 --> 45:25.121
You create, like,
a static hole,

45:25.123 --> 45:27.190
and the voice
of an entity fills that hole-

45:27.192 --> 45:28.591
I've lost you haven't I?
- Yeah.

45:28.593 --> 45:31.027
You lost me at having your hole
filled with entities.

45:31.029 --> 45:33.763
It's possible,
but not for much longer.

45:33.765 --> 45:35.198
In three hours time,

45:35.200 --> 45:37.667
the station turns over
to digital,

45:37.669 --> 45:39.669
and evp only works
with analogue static.

45:39.671 --> 45:41.237
It's our only chance.

45:41.239 --> 45:43.539
This is how you want me
to go out?

45:43.541 --> 45:45.274
With you two
wailing and moaning

45:45.276 --> 45:47.977
like a pair of specters
over the air waves.

45:47.979 --> 45:49.345
Personally...

45:49.347 --> 45:51.314
...I'd rather
play a steps album.

45:51.316 --> 45:54.117
It's never been done live.

45:54.119 --> 45:57.153
Plus it would really piss off
the channel heads.

45:59.156 --> 46:02.091
Okay, you've got ten minutes
after the news break
at two A.M.,

46:02.093 --> 46:04.560
but the first time someone
starts rattling the table,

46:04.562 --> 46:05.962
I'm pulling the plug.

46:05.964 --> 46:07.296
Whey!

46:17.141 --> 46:19.675
Are you going to tell me
what the fuck is going on?

46:19.677 --> 46:21.778
<i> Kate, is that you?</i>

46:23.081 --> 46:25.648
Baby, what's wrong?
You're scaring me.

46:25.650 --> 46:28.017
<i> Here. He's here now.</i>

46:28.019 --> 46:28.918
What?

46:29.653 --> 46:31.420
What's wrong?
Are you okay?

46:31.422 --> 46:33.723
<i> Please, Kate.</i>
<i> I need you.</i>

46:33.725 --> 46:34.824
Nick!

46:36.427 --> 46:38.327
Nick, are you okay?

46:41.366 --> 46:42.565
Nick!

46:43.801 --> 46:45.334
Nick!

46:49.973 --> 46:51.607
Oh, my god.

46:52.910 --> 46:54.777
Jesus, it's you.

46:55.779 --> 46:57.580
He'll be back any second.

47:01.352 --> 47:03.119
Please don't hurt me.

47:15.967 --> 47:17.400
Get away!

48:19.763 --> 48:21.898
<i> It's the midnight hour show</i>

48:21.900 --> 48:24.467
<i> with Laurie wolf on jab.</i>

48:26.637 --> 48:28.537
Welcome back, cub pack.

48:28.539 --> 48:30.740
Hope you enjoyed
the last ever local news

48:30.742 --> 48:33.175
broadcast from this station.

48:33.177 --> 48:35.411
Well, from a last time here

48:35.413 --> 48:38.080
to a first time...

48:38.082 --> 48:39.815
...well... anywhere...

48:40.951 --> 48:44.587
Visiting psychic Carla zazza
has managed to convince me

48:44.589 --> 48:46.422
that we have
a ghost in the machine

48:46.424 --> 48:48.591
here at jab radio,

48:48.593 --> 48:51.360
and she's the one to bust it...

48:52.062 --> 48:53.162
Right?

48:53.164 --> 48:55.164
That's not really what I do.

48:55.166 --> 48:59.068
So tell us, what exactly is it
that you do?

48:59.070 --> 49:02.905
I can contact spirits
of the departed.

49:02.907 --> 49:05.474
Sometimes they
have messages or...

49:05.476 --> 49:08.544
...words of comfort
for those left behind.

49:08.546 --> 49:10.746
For a fee, I'm guessing...

49:11.481 --> 49:12.915
A ghost...

49:13.817 --> 49:15.751
A ghost is like an echo.

49:17.354 --> 49:20.690
What you're hearing or seeing...

49:20.692 --> 49:23.793
...is being bounced back at you
from the past.

49:23.795 --> 49:26.529
Very often a ghost
is caused by...

49:26.531 --> 49:30.533
...a violent
and unnatural death.

49:30.535 --> 49:34.103
Spirits nearly always
have some...

49:34.972 --> 49:36.639
...unfinished business.

49:36.641 --> 49:41.344
Something that keep
their energy from moving on.

49:41.346 --> 49:45.748
And time, time is meaningless
in the spirit realm.

49:45.750 --> 49:47.516
Sometimes a spirit can even

49:47.518 --> 49:50.820
give us some information
about the future.

49:50.822 --> 49:54.790
So tell us what you have
in store for us tonight.

49:54.792 --> 49:58.160
We believe... that an entity

49:58.162 --> 50:01.197
has made contact
with the radio station.

50:01.199 --> 50:02.832
It's pretty common
that freakish entities

50:02.834 --> 50:05.001
to make contact with us
here every night.

50:05.003 --> 50:08.771
Only we call it...
A "phone in".

50:11.708 --> 50:14.176
So what now?
Hold hands and sing?

50:14.178 --> 50:16.078
Maybe if you shut up
and listen

50:16.080 --> 50:19.248
instead of talking over
everything I say

50:19.250 --> 50:20.983
we can start.

50:23.620 --> 50:25.154
If that's the way
you wanna play it...

50:32.829 --> 50:34.697
Baby, are you here?

50:36.367 --> 50:37.700
Nick?

51:16.973 --> 51:19.041
Great radio, genius.

51:27.350 --> 51:32.288
Can the spirit who tried
to contact us... hear me?

51:34.291 --> 51:40.262
Can the spirit who tried
to contact us... hear me?

51:41.865 --> 51:45.434
<i> Does the spirit who tried</i>
<i> to contact us...</i>

51:45.436 --> 51:47.136
<i> ...have a message?</i>

51:47.138 --> 51:48.604
<i> Come to us.</i>

51:49.639 --> 51:50.973
<i> Tell us.</i>

51:52.642 --> 51:54.143
<i> Come to us.</i>

52:06.190 --> 52:09.992
<i> Can the spirit who tried</i>

52:11.027 --> 52:12.461

52:16.167 --> 52:19.635
Does the spirit who tried
to contact us...

52:19.637 --> 52:21.570
...have a message?

52:27.544 --> 52:32.314
Can the spirit who tried
to contact us...

52:32.316 --> 52:33.449
...hear me?

52:41.826 --> 52:43.225
It's here.

52:43.227 --> 52:44.560
It's here.

52:45.629 --> 52:47.296
It's here.

54:11.915 --> 54:13.449
What have you done?!

54:16.152 --> 54:17.720
Do you have a message?

54:20.523 --> 54:22.391
A message?

54:31.035 --> 54:32.468
I'm getting something.

54:34.804 --> 54:37.406
<i> Where am I?</i>

54:41.544 --> 54:42.978
Are you lost?

54:42.980 --> 54:44.380
<i> Who are you?</i>

54:48.184 --> 54:50.452
Are you lost?
Come to us.

54:52.256 --> 54:53.389
Come.

54:55.525 --> 54:57.059
What's your name?

54:59.362 --> 55:00.529
Your name?

55:01.298 --> 55:03.332
<i> Sarah.</i>

55:06.002 --> 55:07.469
Sarah.

55:08.305 --> 55:10.105
Is this your name?
Sarah?

55:11.775 --> 55:15.944
Sarah... we want to help you.

55:18.315 --> 55:20.215
What has happened to you?

55:36.166 --> 55:38.367
<i> What's happened to you?</i>

55:40.203 --> 55:42.237
<i> Can-can we help?</i>

55:45.642 --> 55:46.942
<i> Come to us.</i>

55:47.577 --> 55:49.011
<i> Come to us.</i>

56:46.737 --> 56:49.571
Um, we'd like to apologize to
all our listeners everywhere

56:49.573 --> 56:52.274
for that slight
technical hitch.

56:52.276 --> 56:56.178
Just send me the laundry bill
for your underwear.

56:56.180 --> 56:59.615
You sound like you are
in great pain, Sarah.

57:01.217 --> 57:03.419
Can-can we help?

57:04.220 --> 57:06.321
Can we help you, Sarah?

58:01.845 --> 58:03.245
Please...

58:04.447 --> 58:05.781
Please...

58:09.219 --> 58:10.486
What are you doing?

58:10.488 --> 58:13.489
I am a good man.

58:15.258 --> 58:19.428
I always do
what I think is right.

58:19.430 --> 58:20.529
Please...

58:21.331 --> 58:23.432
I don't know what's happening.

58:23.434 --> 58:25.968
But hear this...

58:27.804 --> 58:29.905
If you talk...

58:31.774 --> 58:34.142
...if you so much as whisper...

58:35.411 --> 58:38.180
...I'll answer the voice
in my heart.

58:38.182 --> 58:43.619
The one that tell me
to cut your tongue out.

58:45.755 --> 58:51.293
You have taken everything
from me.

58:51.295 --> 58:52.728
Everything!

58:54.297 --> 58:55.731
I wanted...

58:56.466 --> 58:58.267
...to ask you...

58:59.536 --> 59:00.669
Why...

59:00.671 --> 59:02.504
...did you do it?

59:02.506 --> 59:04.439
Why did you kill her?

59:06.076 --> 59:10.212
I don't know
what you think I've done!

59:10.214 --> 59:11.480
Liar!

59:16.487 --> 59:18.053
You see?

59:22.158 --> 59:24.126
See what you made me do?

59:25.128 --> 59:28.597
Please... I'm sorry...

59:28.599 --> 59:29.865
I'm so sorry.

59:29.867 --> 59:32.601
Was it... at least quick?

59:33.469 --> 59:35.270
When you killed her?

59:35.272 --> 59:37.306
When you killed my daughter?

59:41.844 --> 59:43.045
I won't be quick.

59:47.216 --> 59:49.384
I'll make you suffer.

01:00:01.064 --> 01:00:03.131
Where are you from?

01:00:03.133 --> 01:00:05.968
<i> The nant pass.</i>

01:00:05.970 --> 01:00:08.870
<i> Below the white hills.</i>

01:00:08.872 --> 01:00:10.138
Where's that?

01:00:10.740 --> 01:00:12.674
There's nothing there.

01:00:12.676 --> 01:00:14.009
Just the odd farm.

01:00:14.011 --> 01:00:15.377
Listen, Sarah...

01:00:16.045 --> 01:00:18.447
Are you from a farm?

01:00:19.048 --> 01:00:21.316
A farm in that area?

01:00:25.188 --> 01:00:28.090
Who... did this to you?

01:00:30.460 --> 01:00:31.860
<i> Him.</i>

01:00:31.862 --> 01:00:33.228
Him?

01:00:33.830 --> 01:00:35.864
<i> My finger...</i>

01:00:35.866 --> 01:00:38.367
<i> He took... my finger.</i>

01:00:38.369 --> 01:00:41.470
Why... would he do this?

01:00:41.472 --> 01:00:43.071
Wedlock killer.

01:00:46.042 --> 01:00:49.678
Ask her if she knows
who killed her.

01:00:49.680 --> 01:00:51.380
Listen.

01:00:51.382 --> 01:00:53.782
Focus on me.

01:00:53.784 --> 01:00:56.318
Focus on my voice.

01:01:01.792 --> 01:01:03.592
An eye for an eye.

01:01:04.193 --> 01:01:06.028
An eye for an eye.

01:01:06.030 --> 01:01:07.295
Hm?

01:01:08.464 --> 01:01:10.032
An eye for an eye.

01:01:11.401 --> 01:01:12.801
An eye for an eye.

01:01:14.671 --> 01:01:16.204
An eye for an eye.

01:01:20.376 --> 01:01:21.943
She's here...

01:01:22.879 --> 01:01:25.547
That girl is here.

01:01:29.952 --> 01:01:31.553
It's a trick...

01:01:33.856 --> 01:01:36.792
She's fooling with you.
- Please.

01:01:36.794 --> 01:01:39.861
Please just listen to me!

01:01:39.863 --> 01:01:43.498
I don't know what's happening!

01:01:43.500 --> 01:01:46.001
You have to believe me.

01:01:48.004 --> 01:01:52.074
Please! Please...

01:01:52.076 --> 01:01:53.742
Please...

01:01:54.343 --> 01:01:55.911
I can't do this.

01:01:59.882 --> 01:02:02.484
You lucky bastard.

01:02:03.886 --> 01:02:05.754
I can't do this.

01:02:12.895 --> 01:02:14.730
Gonna call the police.

01:02:14.732 --> 01:02:17.399
Tell 'em I found the killer.

01:02:17.401 --> 01:02:20.936
Huh?
They can sort you out.

01:02:26.410 --> 01:02:28.210
No!

01:02:34.151 --> 01:02:38.053
No!

01:02:42.126 --> 01:02:43.425
Sarah...

01:02:44.193 --> 01:02:45.560
Sarah, focus on me...

01:02:46.562 --> 01:02:48.029
...on my voice.

01:02:50.234 --> 01:02:51.666
<i> He's dead!</i>

01:02:51.668 --> 01:02:56.872
<i> He... he's dead!</i>

01:03:17.728 --> 01:03:18.927
Marek?

01:03:19.529 --> 01:03:22.063
Oh, my!
Are you okay?

01:03:23.934 --> 01:03:29.337
Tell them... who killed me.

01:03:42.052 --> 01:03:43.585
Do you know?

01:03:43.587 --> 01:03:47.856
Know? Know what?
I don't know anything!

01:03:47.858 --> 01:03:50.392
I didn't think it would be you.

01:03:51.561 --> 01:03:54.429
Look at me.

01:03:54.964 --> 01:03:57.566
Do you know me?

01:03:57.568 --> 01:04:01.169
How? How could it be you?

01:04:24.527 --> 01:04:25.794
No.

01:04:32.969 --> 01:04:34.603
Come on, come on.

01:04:42.411 --> 01:04:44.079
<i> Hello? Kate?</i>

01:04:44.680 --> 01:04:45.747
Kate?

01:04:46.949 --> 01:04:49.351
I can't hear you this end.

01:04:49.353 --> 01:04:50.619
<i> Are you okay?</i>

01:04:52.021 --> 01:04:53.989
Look... it's marek.

01:04:53.991 --> 01:04:56.057
He-he's, uh...

01:04:56.059 --> 01:04:57.893
He's had a...

01:04:57.895 --> 01:05:00.061
Well, I don't know...

01:05:00.063 --> 01:05:01.763
He's not himself.

01:05:01.765 --> 01:05:03.131
<i> I'm bringing him to you.</i>

01:05:03.133 --> 01:05:06.301
I'll be at the radio station
in about 15 minutes, okay?

01:05:06.303 --> 01:05:08.570
Ring me if you get the chance.

01:05:23.386 --> 01:05:26.321
Don't touch him. Please.

01:05:26.323 --> 01:05:27.622
Leave my so alone.

01:05:27.624 --> 01:05:29.624
I want you to see...

01:05:31.193 --> 01:05:34.963
I want you to see
what I'll do to him.

01:05:34.965 --> 01:05:37.365
You're sick!

01:05:37.367 --> 01:05:38.433
Yes.

01:05:38.435 --> 01:05:41.536
Well, you better kill me now,

01:05:41.538 --> 01:05:43.204
because if I get out of this

01:05:43.206 --> 01:05:46.408
I'm going to fucking kill you.

01:05:46.410 --> 01:05:48.777
You stay here.

01:05:49.712 --> 01:05:52.647
I will bring you your son...

01:05:52.649 --> 01:05:54.482
...and you will watch him die.

01:05:54.484 --> 01:05:56.151
You leave me here...

01:05:56.153 --> 01:05:59.220
...and I'm going to fucking
hunt for you,

01:05:59.222 --> 01:06:02.657
you fucking freak!
- You stay here.

01:06:10.800 --> 01:06:13.935
No! No!

01:06:15.771 --> 01:06:18.239
No! No!

01:06:18.741 --> 01:06:20.976
No!

01:06:31.120 --> 01:06:33.922
No, no, no!

01:06:34.690 --> 01:06:38.526
No! No, please!
Please, please!

01:06:38.528 --> 01:06:39.961
Stop.

01:06:43.733 --> 01:06:46.334
Please. Help me, please.

01:07:32.515 --> 01:07:33.715
She's gone.

01:07:33.717 --> 01:07:35.050
We've lost her.

01:07:35.551 --> 01:07:36.684
Wait.

01:07:41.057 --> 01:07:43.625
It's not over yet here.
Wait.

01:07:46.228 --> 01:07:49.164
<i> One person knows.</i>

01:07:49.166 --> 01:07:50.098
Who?

01:07:51.268 --> 01:07:53.101
Who knows?

01:07:54.537 --> 01:07:56.871
<i> At my house.</i>

01:07:56.873 --> 01:07:58.206
<i> Tied up.</i>

01:07:58.208 --> 01:08:00.542
Someone is tied up
at your house?

01:08:01.310 --> 01:08:04.712
<i> She's in danger.</i>

01:08:04.714 --> 01:08:06.347
Who is this person?

01:08:07.884 --> 01:08:09.317
Who?

01:08:09.319 --> 01:08:10.652
Who knows?

01:08:56.232 --> 01:08:57.398
No.

01:10:53.216 --> 01:10:55.984
Wait! We are not finished!

01:10:55.986 --> 01:10:59.220
Power's on, but I got nothing.

01:10:59.222 --> 01:11:00.588
She's gone.

01:11:14.436 --> 01:11:15.970
Nick?

01:11:15.972 --> 01:11:17.205
Nick!

01:11:26.315 --> 01:11:28.216
Who did this to you?

01:11:29.818 --> 01:11:31.319
Don't know. I don't know.

01:11:31.321 --> 01:11:33.921
He was wearin' a mask.
He was in a mask.

01:11:36.358 --> 01:11:38.326
Whose house is this?

01:11:39.194 --> 01:11:42.730
And don't say
a fucking footballer.

01:11:42.732 --> 01:11:44.799
Who lives here?

01:11:46.001 --> 01:11:48.036
I did... I did.

01:11:48.038 --> 01:11:50.605
It's my... family home.

01:11:51.707 --> 01:11:54.542
Then why the fuck
are we trying to rob it?

01:11:54.544 --> 01:11:56.177
There's no jag.

01:11:56.179 --> 01:11:58.046
There's no-no company.

01:11:58.048 --> 01:11:59.247
There's no money.

01:12:00.215 --> 01:12:03.318
Dad has all the money.
Dad has all the money.

01:12:03.320 --> 01:12:05.019
He's giving it to her.

01:12:05.021 --> 01:12:06.854
To Sarah?

01:12:06.856 --> 01:12:08.790
My sister... she's my sister.

01:12:09.858 --> 01:12:11.526
Why didn't you say so?

01:12:13.997 --> 01:12:15.997
I didn't want you to know
i was...

01:12:15.999 --> 01:12:17.699
...stealing from my family.

01:12:17.701 --> 01:12:19.634
Just... just...

01:12:19.636 --> 01:12:22.637
...want you to like me.
I want you... to like me.

01:12:28.844 --> 01:12:31.379
Take the money...
Take the money.

01:12:31.381 --> 01:12:33.348
I need to get you
to a hospital.

01:12:33.350 --> 01:12:34.716
Take the money...

01:12:34.718 --> 01:12:36.517
Take marek...

01:12:36.519 --> 01:12:37.785
...and go somewhere new.

01:12:40.422 --> 01:12:41.889
Take...

01:12:41.891 --> 01:12:43.391
Just take...

01:12:44.326 --> 01:12:46.661
No!

01:12:48.897 --> 01:12:50.231
No!

01:12:52.134 --> 01:12:53.401
No!

01:13:30.873 --> 01:13:32.473
It's okay,<i> cariad.</i>

01:13:32.475 --> 01:13:33.908
We're nearly there.

01:13:40.582 --> 01:13:41.749
Great.

01:13:42.584 --> 01:13:44.352
Fucking genius!

01:13:44.354 --> 01:13:47.588
Whoa. That was... amazing.

01:13:47.590 --> 01:13:50.091
It's a shame we got cut off.

01:13:50.926 --> 01:13:53.928
You two... are sick.

01:13:54.396 --> 01:13:56.664
You nearly had me.

01:13:56.666 --> 01:13:58.466
We did it.

01:13:58.468 --> 01:14:00.368
We actually made contact.

01:14:00.370 --> 01:14:02.003
This is over.

01:14:02.005 --> 01:14:05.873
This stupid fucking experiment
of yours ends now.

01:14:05.875 --> 01:14:07.508
What we did was incredible!

01:14:07.510 --> 01:14:09.811
Then maybe you can write
another book about it,

01:14:09.813 --> 01:14:11.612
that's if you have
enough crayons.

01:14:11.614 --> 01:14:13.381
I'm gonna crack on.

01:14:15.717 --> 01:14:18.085
What is wrong?

01:14:18.087 --> 01:14:19.253
You!

01:14:19.822 --> 01:14:21.322
This whole thing!

01:14:22.825 --> 01:14:24.792
Do you have any idea
what it's like

01:14:24.794 --> 01:14:28.296
to have someone
taken away from you?

01:14:28.298 --> 01:14:29.697
A life?

01:14:30.165 --> 01:14:31.999
Of course.

01:14:32.001 --> 01:14:33.401
You can't...

01:14:34.503 --> 01:14:35.970
Otherwise why would you
spend your time

01:14:35.972 --> 01:14:39.707
trying to convince people that
there is anything beyond this,

01:14:39.709 --> 01:14:42.643
other than
an infinite test signal?

01:14:42.645 --> 01:14:45.279
For precisely that reason.

01:14:49.885 --> 01:14:52.620
So what would my child
say to me, then?

01:14:53.655 --> 01:14:54.789
Hm?

01:14:55.991 --> 01:14:57.658
My unborn child?

01:14:59.127 --> 01:15:00.962
Would he have a message?

01:15:02.865 --> 01:15:05.366
Because he never learned
to talk.

01:15:07.202 --> 01:15:09.237
So how exactly does this work?

01:15:09.239 --> 01:15:10.538
I'm really sorry for your loss.

01:15:10.540 --> 01:15:12.807
I don't need your sympathy!

01:15:12.809 --> 01:15:14.909
I need reality.

01:15:15.978 --> 01:15:17.912
Existence just is
a sliver of light

01:15:17.914 --> 01:15:19.847
between two chasms of darkness.

01:15:19.849 --> 01:15:21.716
I don't believe that.

01:15:22.651 --> 01:15:24.752
We have just proved it.

01:15:24.754 --> 01:15:25.887
No, all you have proved

01:15:25.889 --> 01:15:29.090
was how good you are
at manipulating people.

01:15:29.092 --> 01:15:31.292
And the wedlock killer?

01:15:31.294 --> 01:15:34.262
That's just
in poor fucking taste.

01:15:34.264 --> 01:15:37.198
Real people are dealing
with that, right now.

01:15:37.200 --> 01:15:39.233
He's not Jack the ripper

01:15:39.235 --> 01:15:41.636
or killer of the week
on Columbo.

01:15:41.638 --> 01:15:44.205
He's out there now
doing god knows what.

01:15:44.207 --> 01:15:46.073
And you're trading
on his infamy.

01:15:46.075 --> 01:15:48.576
We'll have to agree
to disagree.

01:15:48.578 --> 01:15:49.744
Yeah.

01:15:50.512 --> 01:15:52.747
I'm going to have a cigarette.

01:15:52.749 --> 01:15:56.651
- You can smoke in here.
- I need a break from her shit.

01:15:56.653 --> 01:15:58.286
Yeah, you and aleister crowley
in there

01:15:58.288 --> 01:16:00.821
have pretty much killed
my final show!

01:16:00.823 --> 01:16:03.758
Maybe that's what we
should be trying to contact
from beyond the grave:

01:16:03.760 --> 01:16:05.760
My career!

01:16:06.862 --> 01:16:09.530
Are you there, career?

01:16:20.275 --> 01:16:22.577
Come on!

01:16:24.079 --> 01:16:25.146
Fuck!

01:16:58.681 --> 01:17:00.114
Balls!

01:17:00.116 --> 01:17:02.049
Antenna's gone tits up again!

01:17:02.051 --> 01:17:03.317
It's nearly the end.

01:17:03.319 --> 01:17:06.320
Don't you want thx quality
sound for the end of the show?

01:17:06.322 --> 01:17:07.755
Not particularly.

01:17:13.395 --> 01:17:14.895
Five minutes.

01:17:15.464 --> 01:17:17.198
You've got three.

01:17:51.633 --> 01:17:53.834
I'm gonna go in first, okay?

01:17:53.836 --> 01:17:55.302
You wait here.

01:17:56.506 --> 01:17:59.740
Okay, okay.
We'll go together.

01:19:15.885 --> 01:19:17.284
Marek?

01:19:25.927 --> 01:19:27.695
Marek?

01:19:28.730 --> 01:19:29.997
Marek?

01:19:34.136 --> 01:19:37.371
Oh, my god! Marek!

01:19:38.507 --> 01:19:40.741
<i> It's the midnight hour show</i>

01:19:40.743 --> 01:19:43.978
<i> with Laurie wolf on jab.</i>

01:19:43.980 --> 01:19:46.881
<i> Just 20 minutes</i>
<i> until sunrise.</i>

01:19:46.883 --> 01:19:49.750
That's nearly it
for our last night, folks.

01:19:49.752 --> 01:19:52.553
But it's been one hell
of a ride, hasn't it?

01:19:53.688 --> 01:19:55.823
We brought you laughs...

01:19:55.825 --> 01:19:57.091
...tears...

01:19:57.893 --> 01:20:00.661
...and voices
from beyond the grave.

01:20:00.663 --> 01:20:02.596
<i> Lets see if they can do that</i>
<i> on the London networks</i>

01:20:02.598 --> 01:20:04.999
<i> without stopping the un-dead</i>
<i> to advertise life insurance</i>

01:20:05.001 --> 01:20:06.433
<i> every five minutes.</i>

01:20:07.536 --> 01:20:09.470
Nearly time
to sign off forever...

01:20:11.139 --> 01:20:13.707
...but still room
for a few more tunes.

01:20:15.610 --> 01:20:19.180
<i> Yes folks, if you've made</i>
<i> it through the night then...</i>

01:20:19.182 --> 01:20:20.781
<i> ...sleep tight.</i>

01:20:20.783 --> 01:20:22.683
<i> If you're an early riser</i>
<i> then you're waking up</i>

01:20:22.685 --> 01:20:24.752
<i> to what experts</i>
<i> are already calling</i>

01:20:24.754 --> 01:20:27.188
<i> Saturday the 17th</i>
<i> of September.</i>

01:20:36.264 --> 01:20:37.998
<i> Sometimes a spirit can even</i>

01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:41.268
<i> give us some information</i>
<i> about the future.</i>

01:20:50.011 --> 01:20:51.946
It's called a delay.

01:20:51.948 --> 01:20:53.214
Oh, my god.

01:20:54.015 --> 01:20:56.684
Ben, thank god!

01:20:56.686 --> 01:20:57.852
Oh!

01:20:58.988 --> 01:21:00.921
We use it to check content.

01:21:03.491 --> 01:21:05.893
Make sure there is no swearing
or anything like that.

01:21:07.028 --> 01:21:09.096
Of course, to the audience...

01:21:10.799 --> 01:21:14.235
...it sounds live,
but in reality...

01:21:16.238 --> 01:21:17.705
...it was last night.

01:21:18.340 --> 01:21:20.274
Great really, I mean...

01:21:20.276 --> 01:21:21.942
Pop out for a pint.

01:21:22.878 --> 01:21:24.945
Be in two places at once.

01:21:30.218 --> 01:21:31.886
What have you done to marek?

01:21:31.888 --> 01:21:32.920
Where is my son?

01:21:32.922 --> 01:21:34.088
Well, first thing's first.

01:21:34.090 --> 01:21:36.624
You should listen
to the end of the show.

01:21:36.626 --> 01:21:38.092
It's really good.

01:21:38.094 --> 01:21:39.593
I think...

01:21:40.629 --> 01:21:43.330
...this is my favorite bit.

01:21:43.332 --> 01:21:46.200
Well... so long...

01:21:47.135 --> 01:21:48.969
<i> Auf wiedersehen...</i>

01:21:48.971 --> 01:21:50.404
<i> Sayonara...</i>

01:21:51.539 --> 01:21:53.040
<i> Ciao, Bella.</i>

01:21:55.310 --> 01:21:58.979
It's goodbye from me,
Laurie wolf...

01:21:58.981 --> 01:22:00.748
...and my partners in crime,

01:22:00.750 --> 01:22:03.651
Ben the technician...

01:22:03.653 --> 01:22:06.720
...and psychic, Carla zazza.

01:22:09.491 --> 01:22:11.458
Saying goodbye
for the final time.

01:22:12.794 --> 01:22:15.195
See you crazy kids
on the other side...

01:22:21.937 --> 01:22:23.504
Well...

01:22:23.506 --> 01:22:28.442
...that, all things considered,
was a load of old shit.

01:22:30.278 --> 01:22:32.046
I wanted to go out on top.

01:22:34.683 --> 01:22:38.285
Right... priorities.

01:22:38.287 --> 01:22:40.321
Fucking crisps.

01:22:42.257 --> 01:22:43.891
Earth to Ben!

01:23:06.715 --> 01:23:07.982
Jackpot.

01:23:11.052 --> 01:23:12.319
Sweets.

01:23:21.563 --> 01:23:23.630
If anyone's listening,
I'm at the jab radio station.

01:23:23.632 --> 01:23:25.799
Call the police
and send them here!

01:23:27.435 --> 01:23:29.470
Why have you gotta
go poking about?

01:23:29.472 --> 01:23:31.739
Oh, Jesus fuck, Ben!

01:23:32.474 --> 01:23:34.041
You shouldn't have seen them.

01:23:36.044 --> 01:23:38.445
Oh, my god! It's you!

01:23:39.749 --> 01:23:41.882
It's been me for years, Laurie.

01:23:42.884 --> 01:23:44.218
Right at your side.

01:23:45.587 --> 01:23:47.554
You know, first,
i wanted to kill you.

01:23:49.190 --> 01:23:50.724
Nearly did...

01:23:51.926 --> 01:23:53.627
...but when you recovered...

01:23:55.030 --> 01:23:57.164
...i couldn't resist.

01:23:57.166 --> 01:23:58.999
This wasn't you...

01:23:59.001 --> 01:24:00.534
It was-
- your idiot boyfriend?

01:24:00.536 --> 01:24:02.703
No, he just took the fall.

01:24:03.538 --> 01:24:04.738
I mean...

01:24:05.573 --> 01:24:06.974
...all this time...

01:24:08.143 --> 01:24:09.943
...i was there...

01:24:09.945 --> 01:24:11.678
...with you.

01:24:12.347 --> 01:24:14.214
And you never once suspected.

01:24:15.650 --> 01:24:17.751
That as more exciting
than killing you.

01:24:19.587 --> 01:24:20.988
But now...

01:24:22.992 --> 01:24:25.659
Oh, go on, you fucking prick!

01:24:25.661 --> 01:24:27.461
...i get to do that too.

01:24:30.965 --> 01:24:32.800
Oh, my god.

01:24:37.238 --> 01:24:40.874
I'm sad you had to look
in that cupboard.

01:24:40.876 --> 01:24:44.478
Who knows how long we could
have kept this dance going?

01:24:46.381 --> 01:24:49.450
Fuck... you.

01:24:51.386 --> 01:24:52.853
Maybe if you had.

01:24:54.023 --> 01:24:56.490
Jesus Christ, you killed her!

01:24:56.492 --> 01:24:58.192
Oh, I killed everyone.

01:24:58.194 --> 01:25:00.127
Including Carla the psychic.

01:25:01.496 --> 01:25:04.331
I mean... she was shit.

01:25:04.333 --> 01:25:07.000
She should've seen
that coming, really.

01:25:07.002 --> 01:25:08.102
But the voices...

01:25:09.104 --> 01:25:11.605
...the voices from beyond
that grave that could...

01:25:11.607 --> 01:25:13.373
...predict the future...

01:25:14.242 --> 01:25:15.943
That, I couldn't explain.

01:25:17.679 --> 01:25:20.214
<i> One person knows.</i>

01:25:23.952 --> 01:25:25.319
We are not finished!

01:25:25.321 --> 01:25:26.720
She's gone.

01:25:26.722 --> 01:25:28.956
And I had to know.

01:25:28.958 --> 01:25:31.592
I had to know who it would be
at Sarah's house.

01:25:33.361 --> 01:25:35.496
I never thought
it would be you.

01:25:35.498 --> 01:25:36.630
And Sarah?

01:25:36.632 --> 01:25:37.865
<i> Please don't hurt me.</i>

01:25:39.100 --> 01:25:41.335
Oh, we met on the Internet.

01:25:41.337 --> 01:25:43.036
Met them all on the Internet.

01:25:44.973 --> 01:25:46.173
Hiya.

01:25:46.175 --> 01:25:47.741
Amazing, really.

01:25:47.743 --> 01:25:51.044
I mean... you can be anybody.

01:25:51.813 --> 01:25:53.213
Anybody you want.

01:25:53.215 --> 01:25:54.214
Please...

01:25:55.184 --> 01:25:57.551
I mean, that's how we met,
isn't it?

01:26:00.121 --> 01:26:02.422
What have you done to my son?

01:26:03.057 --> 01:26:04.491
Where is he?

01:26:04.493 --> 01:26:05.959
If you've hurt him--

01:26:05.961 --> 01:26:08.028
of course I haven't hurt him.
Don't be silly.

01:26:08.030 --> 01:26:10.164
Promised you, didn't I?

01:26:10.166 --> 01:26:12.132
I'd kill him in front of you.

01:26:15.870 --> 01:26:17.137
Fuck!

01:26:46.734 --> 01:26:48.101
Marek?

01:26:49.404 --> 01:26:50.804
Marek?

01:26:59.214 --> 01:27:01.982
<i> Behind the door...</i>

01:27:03.051 --> 01:27:05.452
<i> He's behind the door!</i>

01:27:17.131 --> 01:27:19.666
Oh, my god.

01:27:19.668 --> 01:27:22.035
Oh, you're okay.

01:27:22.037 --> 01:27:23.470
You're okay.

01:27:24.172 --> 01:27:26.540
Everything will be okay.

01:27:26.542 --> 01:27:30.177
We-we have to get you
out of here.

01:27:30.179 --> 01:27:31.278
What?

01:27:31.679 --> 01:27:33.413
What is this?

01:27:33.415 --> 01:27:35.415
Oh, no.

01:27:35.417 --> 01:27:37.417
No, no!

01:27:37.885 --> 01:27:40.520
No! No, no!

01:27:44.559 --> 01:27:46.260
He's coming...

01:27:48.597 --> 01:27:50.297
I need to get something
from the car

01:27:50.299 --> 01:27:51.398
to cut this,

01:27:51.400 --> 01:27:53.166
but I will be back.

01:27:53.168 --> 01:27:55.936
I promise I'll come back.
Look at me.

01:27:55.938 --> 01:27:58.171
I promise I'll come back.

01:27:58.173 --> 01:28:00.841
You just have to be quiet
for mommy, okay?

01:28:00.843 --> 01:28:02.576
You just have to be very quiet.

01:28:03.945 --> 01:28:05.579
Mommy loves you.

01:30:21.616 --> 01:30:24.284
Let's not forget the finger.

01:31:02.790 --> 01:31:05.058
Aah! Fuck!

01:31:19.575 --> 01:31:21.908
Get away!

01:31:21.910 --> 01:31:23.076
Fucker!

01:31:31.487 --> 01:31:33.253
Get away, you fucker!

01:32:00.482 --> 01:32:02.582
No! No!

01:32:05.319 --> 01:32:07.087
No!

01:32:42.958 --> 01:32:45.659
Now you fucking burn.

01:32:47.461 --> 01:32:50.030
I wanna smell
your insides cook.

01:33:05.146 --> 01:33:07.814
I told you I was going to
fucking kill you.

01:34:11.078 --> 01:34:12.779
<i> The supernatural.</i>

01:34:14.081 --> 01:34:17.017
<i> It's our word for shit</i>
<i> we don't understand.</i>

01:34:18.954 --> 01:34:20.320
See?

01:34:21.088 --> 01:34:22.789
Mommy came back.

01:34:24.025 --> 01:34:27.260
I promised you I'm gonna
come back for you.

01:34:27.262 --> 01:34:28.862
<i> I was like you once...</i>

01:34:29.997 --> 01:34:31.865
...a skeptic...

01:34:33.034 --> 01:34:35.702
...but now my eyes are open.

01:34:38.005 --> 01:34:40.373
But like so many answers...

01:34:41.342 --> 01:34:44.377
<i> ...it just leads</i>
<i> to more questions.</i>

01:34:44.379 --> 01:34:47.047
<i> Are the good rewarded</i>
<i> in the next life?</i>

01:34:48.082 --> 01:34:50.417
<i> Are the wicked punished?</i>

01:34:51.318 --> 01:34:53.553
<i> Is there anything after this?</i>

01:34:55.990 --> 01:34:57.791
<i> Fucked if I know.</i>

01:34:59.193 --> 01:35:01.027
Guess I'm about to find out.
