WEBVTT

00:02.191 --> 00:03.492
STRINGER: Previously
on "The Practice"...

00:03.526 --> 00:05.428
We need to have all
the computer passwords

00:05.461 --> 00:06.929
changed by Thursday, noon.

00:06.962 --> 00:09.432
This is extremely
confidential.

00:09.465 --> 00:10.666
WILSON: Eugene's hired
a labor-law firm

00:10.699 --> 00:11.600
for something.

00:11.634 --> 00:13.736
All the computer passwords
are being changed.

00:13.769 --> 00:15.904
It looks like someone's
getting fired.

00:15.938 --> 00:16.772
YOUNG: We've decided
to let you go.

00:16.805 --> 00:18.006
Go where?

00:18.041 --> 00:21.744
Here's a check representing
two weeks' severance pay.

00:21.777 --> 00:23.679
I'd like you to leave
immediately.

00:23.712 --> 00:26.949
I've generated fees in excess
of six million dollars.

00:26.982 --> 00:29.252
You've handed me
a check for $15,000.

00:29.285 --> 00:30.586
You can keep it.

00:30.619 --> 00:31.920
YOUNG: Alan Shore seemed
to know this was coming.

00:31.954 --> 00:33.356
Did you tell him?

00:33.389 --> 00:34.323
Yes.

00:34.357 --> 00:36.925
Your employment
here is terminated.

00:36.959 --> 00:38.527
Forty minutes ago,
we fired Alan.

00:38.561 --> 00:39.795
I'm sorry?

00:39.828 --> 00:41.797
Jimmy and I agreed
that on balance--

00:41.830 --> 00:43.599
You and Jimmy agreed?
Why wasn't I--

00:43.632 --> 00:44.367
Because you're his friend.

00:44.400 --> 00:45.834
That's crap!

00:45.868 --> 00:46.702
I'm sorry.

00:46.735 --> 00:49.004
I'm gonna try
and dissuade them from--

00:49.038 --> 00:51.674
SHORE: Ellenor,
it's a place of work,

00:51.707 --> 00:52.541
nothing more.

00:52.575 --> 00:55.044
I didn't figure
you'd go so quietly.

00:55.078 --> 00:58.281
Who said anything
about going quietly?

00:58.314 --> 01:00.989
This is going to get
very ugly.

01:07.563 --> 01:10.533
Eugene, he struck again.

01:10.833 --> 01:12.268
What now?

01:16.272 --> 01:17.440
Hi.

01:17.473 --> 01:19.842
This message
is for Eugene and Jimmy,

01:19.875 --> 01:21.009
especially Jimmy.

01:21.044 --> 01:24.047
I just wanna say I miss
you all terribly,

01:24.080 --> 01:25.948
and I can't wait
till I return,

01:25.981 --> 01:28.251
which should be very,
very soon.

01:28.917 --> 01:30.853
BERLUTI:
He's on my computer, too,

01:30.886 --> 01:32.188
brushing his teeth.

01:32.221 --> 01:34.923
Has he made any attempts
to take files?

01:34.957 --> 01:36.259
Not that I can tell.

01:38.094 --> 01:39.928
Ellenor...

01:39.962 --> 01:42.931
tell your friend if he continues
to break into our computers,

01:42.965 --> 01:44.567
we're going to the police.

01:45.201 --> 01:46.769
Yes, Eugene.

01:46.802 --> 01:48.871
I've demonstrated
such a fine ability

01:48.904 --> 01:50.173
to control him, haven't I?

01:51.474 --> 01:52.841
I'm off to Court.

01:56.545 --> 01:58.681
You're giving me $5,000?

01:58.714 --> 01:59.948
Yes.

01:59.982 --> 02:01.090
For what?

02:01.124 --> 02:02.525
What'll it get me?

02:03.292 --> 02:06.129
A slap in the face,
and it'll be free.

02:07.796 --> 02:09.098
Tara, I got you fired.

02:09.132 --> 02:10.966
No, you didn't.

02:10.999 --> 02:12.468
I made the choice
to betray Eugene.

02:12.501 --> 02:13.636
You don't owe me anything.

02:17.073 --> 02:18.940
That isn't true,
and we both know that.

02:20.442 --> 02:22.845
Look, let me
at least try to get you

02:22.878 --> 02:23.979
rehired someplace else.

02:24.012 --> 02:25.981
I've got my bar exam
coming up in July.

02:26.014 --> 02:27.716
I should probably take
time off anyway.

02:30.386 --> 02:31.787
I'm fine, Alan.

02:32.521 --> 02:35.491
I don't like being
in someone else's debt.

02:36.959 --> 02:38.327
So, what are you gonna do?

02:39.262 --> 02:41.630
Why, I'm going to get
what's mine, of course,

02:41.664 --> 02:44.600
which is the real reason
I'm here.

02:46.669 --> 02:48.804
If this should go to trial,

02:48.837 --> 02:52.007
witnesses will be called
for both sides.

02:52.041 --> 02:54.977
May I call you to be on mine?

02:56.179 --> 02:57.580
What did I witness?

02:57.613 --> 03:00.856
For starters,
the conspiracy to fire me.

03:00.889 --> 03:02.825
I also suspect
they might try to raise

03:02.858 --> 03:05.961
my ethical deficits
as grounds for the discharge.

03:05.994 --> 03:08.431
You might be able
to bolster my estoppel claims,

03:08.464 --> 03:10.233
as well as--

03:10.266 --> 03:12.335
well, you're familiar
with the doctrine

03:12.368 --> 03:14.103
of unclean hands, aren't you?

03:15.371 --> 03:17.440
How messy is this gonna get?

03:17.473 --> 03:19.875
May I count on you, Tara?

03:22.378 --> 03:24.080
I need you.

03:27.216 --> 03:31.154
(music playing)

04:09.732 --> 04:11.234
I can't believe
they're actually

04:11.267 --> 04:12.701
prosecuting me for this.

04:12.735 --> 04:14.470
This just isn't right,
Ellenor.

04:14.503 --> 04:16.572
FRUTT: Carrie,
you did hit a police officer.

04:16.605 --> 04:18.241
In self-defense.

04:18.274 --> 04:19.742
Well, come on.
It wasn't exactly--

04:19.774 --> 04:21.209
You said you
would make this go away.

04:21.244 --> 04:22.578
Those were your exact words.

04:22.611 --> 04:24.447
I thought I could,
but they're choosing

04:24.480 --> 04:25.748
to make an example--

04:25.781 --> 04:28.016
I will lose my job
if I get a conviction.

04:28.051 --> 04:30.119
My boss wants
to fire me already,

04:30.153 --> 04:31.620
and he says
with an assault conviction,

04:31.654 --> 04:32.588
that's cause.

04:32.621 --> 04:34.123
And I may lose
my kids, too.

04:34.156 --> 04:36.125
Oh, my ex is always
revisiting custody,

04:36.158 --> 04:37.693
and he's licking
himself over this.

04:37.726 --> 04:39.761
I cannot get
a conviction, Ellenor.

04:39.795 --> 04:41.397
You promised me.

04:41.430 --> 04:42.898
Carrie, listen to me.

04:43.899 --> 04:46.235
We are about to go
into that Courtroom.

04:46.269 --> 04:47.070
It is important--

04:47.103 --> 04:49.105
Don't talk to me
like I'm a child.

04:49.138 --> 04:51.907
I am talking
to a criminal defendant.

04:53.008 --> 04:56.245
Your demeanor will factor
into the disposition.

04:56.279 --> 04:57.746
You need to rein yourself in.

04:57.780 --> 04:58.814
Do you understand?

04:59.282 --> 05:01.424
You promised me.

05:05.994 --> 05:07.796
Have you been dissatisfied

05:07.830 --> 05:08.797
with our performance
to date?

05:08.831 --> 05:09.798
Far from it.

05:09.832 --> 05:12.000
I think
you're superior lawyers,

05:12.035 --> 05:14.070
but I did come here
because of Alan Shore,

05:14.103 --> 05:15.338
and now that he's gone--

05:15.371 --> 05:17.040
We certainly respect

05:17.073 --> 05:18.274
your relationship
with Alan,

05:18.307 --> 05:22.111
and I realize our experience
is primarily criminal,

05:22.145 --> 05:23.646
but we have become
full-service

05:23.679 --> 05:25.248
with some remarkable
results

05:25.281 --> 05:28.417
in civil cases against
a tobacco company, against--

05:28.451 --> 05:30.419
Mr. Young,
I run a securities firm.

05:30.453 --> 05:32.655
Alan Shore has much more
experience with--

05:32.688 --> 05:35.624
Certainly, if you choose
to go to another firm,

05:35.658 --> 05:37.893
we will honor that decision,

05:37.926 --> 05:38.861
but as your current lawyers,

05:39.962 --> 05:42.798
we have a fiduciary duty
to advise you that, uh...

05:46.035 --> 05:47.703
uh, there are many firms

05:47.736 --> 05:49.205
that can give you
great service,

05:49.238 --> 05:52.141
but I must strongly
caution you

05:52.175 --> 05:53.942
against going
with Alan Shore.

05:57.146 --> 05:57.980
Why?

06:01.390 --> 06:03.559
It is our belief
that he is unstable,

06:03.592 --> 06:07.130
that he has self-destructive
personality tendencies,

06:07.163 --> 06:09.765
that he's also prone
to committing unethical,

06:09.798 --> 06:11.667
sometimes
even criminal, acts.

06:11.700 --> 06:13.902
You're in the securities
business.

06:13.936 --> 06:15.804
You have to avoid
even the appearance

06:15.838 --> 06:16.739
of impropriety.

06:16.772 --> 06:18.807
One false step can cost you

06:18.841 --> 06:21.177
and your shareholders
millions of dollars.

06:22.911 --> 06:26.449
Now, of course, we would
like you to stay with us,

06:26.882 --> 06:28.684
but wherever you take
your business,

06:28.717 --> 06:30.386
I would urge you again

06:30.419 --> 06:32.821
not to take it
to Alan Shore.

06:37.693 --> 06:39.395
LAWRENCE:
At first, she was polite,

06:39.428 --> 06:41.664
but as soon as we told
her to relocate,

06:41.697 --> 06:42.898
she became abusive.

06:42.931 --> 06:44.600
And what did you do then?

06:44.633 --> 06:46.969
LAWRENCE: I informed her
that if she wouldn't move

06:47.002 --> 06:48.137
peacefully and willingly,

06:48.171 --> 06:49.738
I'd have to physically
escort her.

06:49.772 --> 06:51.440
And how did she respond?

06:51.474 --> 06:53.509
She said something about me

06:53.542 --> 06:54.943
having sex with my mother.

06:54.977 --> 06:56.945
BELLAMY:
And then what happened?

06:56.979 --> 06:58.681
I proceeded to physically
escort her,

06:58.714 --> 07:00.383
and that's when she
assaulted me.

07:00.416 --> 07:02.891
Officer, I have a,
uh, videotape

07:02.925 --> 07:04.460
made by a bystander,

07:04.493 --> 07:05.528
which I would like to play.

07:05.561 --> 07:06.362
Objection.

07:06.395 --> 07:07.330
Overruled.

07:12.168 --> 07:13.036
BELLAMY: Okay,
we've highlighted you

07:13.069 --> 07:16.572
and Ms. Moses
to make it easier to see.

07:16.605 --> 07:18.074
This is, in fact, you?

07:18.107 --> 07:19.675
LAWRENCE: Yes, it is.

07:20.709 --> 07:22.711
She's arguing
with me at this point.

07:24.180 --> 07:26.349
Right here,
I put my hand on her elbow

07:26.382 --> 07:27.283
to escort her.

07:33.522 --> 07:35.191
BELLAMY:
Does this tape fairly

07:35.224 --> 07:37.626
and accurately reflect
what happened?

07:37.660 --> 07:38.627
Yes.

07:38.661 --> 07:40.529
Thank you, officer.

07:47.470 --> 07:49.238
Could you tell us
why the crowd

07:49.272 --> 07:50.739
was gathered
on Boylston Street?

07:50.773 --> 07:52.741
There was a presidential
motorcade.

07:53.542 --> 07:54.810
President Bush was in town?

07:54.843 --> 07:55.711
Yes.

07:55.744 --> 07:57.012
FRUTT:
And why did you object

07:57.046 --> 07:59.082
to my client being
in this crowd?

07:59.115 --> 08:00.483
She was carrying a placard

08:00.516 --> 08:01.824
that was critical
of the president.

08:01.857 --> 08:04.793
FRUTT: So you made
the decision to relocate her?

08:04.827 --> 08:07.063
Yes, ma'am, acting in concert

08:07.096 --> 08:08.197
with the Secret Service.

08:08.231 --> 08:11.367
The Secret Service asked you
to remove my client?

08:11.400 --> 08:13.036
LAWRENCE:
Not her specifically.

08:13.069 --> 08:14.837
When the president travels,

08:14.870 --> 08:17.740
the Secret Service scouts
the location in advance

08:17.773 --> 08:19.442
and directs local
law enforcement

08:19.475 --> 08:22.978
to set up free-speech zones,
or protest zones,

08:23.011 --> 08:25.748
where those who choose
to protest can assemble.

08:26.482 --> 08:28.584
So, you told my client
she had to go

08:28.617 --> 08:30.353
three miles away down
by the harbor?

08:30.386 --> 08:33.256
That's where the designated
protest zone was, down in--

08:33.289 --> 08:35.823
So to carry a placard
to protest

08:35.857 --> 08:37.159
against the president,

08:37.193 --> 08:38.727
one would have to go
to a place

08:38.760 --> 08:40.996
where the president
couldn't possibly see it.

08:41.030 --> 08:42.698
LAWRENCE: It's an
anti-terrorist policy.

08:44.067 --> 08:45.134
Terrorist?

08:45.168 --> 08:45.868
LAWRENCE: Yes.

08:45.901 --> 08:47.803
Terrorists pose
a security risk,

08:47.836 --> 08:50.373
and, obviously,
tend to be anti-U. S.,

08:50.406 --> 08:52.508
so we relocate protesters

08:52.541 --> 08:54.843
to where they won't pose
a risk to the president.

08:56.312 --> 08:57.913
FRUTT: Just so I'm clear,

08:57.946 --> 08:59.948
people with pro-Bush signs

08:59.982 --> 09:02.158
were allowed to line
the streets for the motorcade.

09:02.191 --> 09:04.527
People with anti-Bush signs

09:04.560 --> 09:06.729
were either taken away
or arrested.

09:06.762 --> 09:08.097
Basically.

09:08.131 --> 09:09.298
And when you tried
to explain this

09:09.332 --> 09:11.367
to my client,
she became enraged.

09:11.400 --> 09:12.735
Very enraged.

09:12.768 --> 09:14.270
FRUTT: And as a result
of her rage,

09:14.303 --> 09:16.739
and you trying
to physically escort her,

09:16.772 --> 09:18.041
she threw a punch.

09:18.074 --> 09:19.342
Basically.

09:22.611 --> 09:24.647
It's stunning.

09:24.680 --> 09:26.949
Recently, two grandmothers
were arrested

09:26.982 --> 09:29.518
in Florida for waving
tiny handwritten

09:29.552 --> 09:32.355
protest cards outside
of the designated

09:32.388 --> 09:33.456
free-speech zone.

09:33.489 --> 09:34.990
What's the point?

09:36.059 --> 09:37.060
What's the point?

09:37.093 --> 09:38.894
You didn't wanna have
a beer to lament

09:38.927 --> 09:40.596
the demise of free speech.

09:40.629 --> 09:42.031
What's the point?

09:42.065 --> 09:44.400
I know you hired a lawyer.

09:46.469 --> 09:48.404
Alan, give it some time,

09:48.437 --> 09:49.705
so tempers can--

09:51.974 --> 09:53.942
I'd like to work this out.

09:53.976 --> 09:54.977
So would I.

09:55.010 --> 09:57.980
Then you can't be sending
e-mails of yourself.

09:58.013 --> 10:00.349
If you antagonize
Eugene and Jimmy--

10:02.058 --> 10:04.560
Look, you can't get fired

10:04.593 --> 10:05.661
by two firms in one year.

10:05.694 --> 10:07.230
As brilliant as you are,

10:07.263 --> 10:09.465
your career
will never recover.

10:09.498 --> 10:11.234
You need to work this out.

10:11.267 --> 10:13.136
I land on my feet, Ellenor.

10:13.169 --> 10:15.371
I could show you
the bunions to prove it.

10:16.239 --> 10:17.005
(sighs)

10:20.609 --> 10:22.578
I need you to work this out.

10:26.882 --> 10:29.085
I can't bear the idea
of going back to work

10:29.118 --> 10:30.453
with you not being there.

10:34.690 --> 10:37.793
A fight hurts everybody.

10:41.930 --> 10:43.999
I'd need to be able
to bring Tara back.

10:46.635 --> 10:49.105
Let's get this to the table,

10:49.138 --> 10:50.506
and we'll work it out.

11:00.923 --> 11:02.658
All I'm asking, Eugene,

11:02.691 --> 11:04.393
is that you keep an open mind.

11:07.063 --> 11:08.797
Has it ever been open?

11:08.831 --> 11:10.866
I don't think
it's my objectivity

11:10.899 --> 11:12.235
that's in question here,
Ellenor.

11:12.268 --> 11:13.669
Okay.

11:13.702 --> 11:15.404
I'm biased.

11:15.438 --> 11:17.606
I plead guilty,

11:17.640 --> 11:19.875
but I am speaking objectively

11:19.908 --> 11:22.478
when I say a war
is bad for business--

11:22.511 --> 11:24.147
our business.

11:24.180 --> 11:26.082
Look at any law-firm divorce.

11:26.115 --> 11:27.650
Show me one where anybody

11:27.683 --> 11:28.551
has come out ahead.

11:31.287 --> 11:32.588
We'll talk
to the man's lawyer.

11:35.424 --> 11:36.392
Thank you.

11:39.162 --> 11:41.597
CARRIE:
I like President Bush.

11:41.630 --> 11:42.598
I voted for him before.

11:42.631 --> 11:44.133
I'll probably vote
for him again,

11:44.167 --> 11:45.601
uh, and I'm pro-war.

11:45.634 --> 11:47.303
I'm not one
of those liberals.

11:47.336 --> 11:48.804
I cheered when
they caught Saddam.

11:48.837 --> 11:49.805
So did my kids.

11:49.838 --> 11:50.839
They wanted
to cut off his head

11:50.873 --> 11:51.740
and play soccer with it.

11:51.774 --> 11:54.443
Carrie, what were you
protesting that day?

11:54.477 --> 11:55.811
The environment.

11:55.844 --> 11:57.813
FRUTT: You're against
the environment?

11:57.846 --> 11:59.382
CARRIE: No, I'm for it.

11:59.415 --> 12:02.025
I'm very concerned about
the air my kids breathe,

12:02.058 --> 12:03.692
and what I was protesting--

12:03.726 --> 12:06.195
See, the EPA
puts out some report

12:06.229 --> 12:08.831
to give the public warnings
and stuff on the environment.

12:08.864 --> 12:11.134
And the administration
censored it

12:11.167 --> 12:12.468
so the public wouldn't know

12:12.501 --> 12:14.203
what they were trying
to warn us about.

12:14.237 --> 12:15.471
What's up with that?

12:15.504 --> 12:17.540
FRUTT: So you had a placard.

12:17.573 --> 12:19.742
Saying,
"Don't censor the EPA."

12:19.775 --> 12:22.111
And this policeman tells me
that I've got to go

12:22.145 --> 12:24.813
somewhere five miles away
from the motorcade.

12:24.847 --> 12:26.815
So when he told you this...

12:27.550 --> 12:29.485
I hit him.

12:29.518 --> 12:31.019
Not right away.

12:31.054 --> 12:33.456
We first had words.

12:33.489 --> 12:35.758
He said that my carrying
a placard on the EPA

12:35.791 --> 12:37.993
somehow made me
a security risk.

12:38.027 --> 12:40.063
I said, "What about
my right to assemble?"

12:40.096 --> 12:42.565
He said,
"I got a right to assemble,

12:42.598 --> 12:44.500
but it's in another
section of town."

12:44.533 --> 12:46.269
And then he got belligerent

12:46.302 --> 12:47.370
and dismissive,

12:47.403 --> 12:48.737
and that's when I made
reference

12:48.771 --> 12:50.139
to him in
an unfavorable light,

12:50.173 --> 12:52.408
and at that point,
he grabbed me to pull me off,

12:52.441 --> 12:53.909
and on instinct,
I lost it.

12:55.311 --> 12:57.513
Free-speech zone,

12:57.546 --> 12:59.382
I thought this whole country

12:59.415 --> 13:00.689
was a free-speech zone.

13:04.060 --> 13:06.129
What do you mean
I didn't do well?

13:06.162 --> 13:07.963
You did great,

13:07.996 --> 13:10.033
but you came off
a little gruff.

13:10.066 --> 13:11.434
Gruff?

13:11.467 --> 13:13.202
You could have left out the

13:13.236 --> 13:14.870
"Playing soccer
with Saddam's head."

13:14.903 --> 13:16.905
That doesn't make me gruff.

13:16.939 --> 13:19.208
Carrie, I'm just afraid

13:19.242 --> 13:21.810
the jury is gonna read you
as antagonistic.

13:23.679 --> 13:25.781
I could probably plead
this out

13:25.814 --> 13:27.216
on a misdemeanor battery.

13:27.250 --> 13:30.819
But what about
my right to protest?

13:30.853 --> 13:33.089
Well, that right
doesn't include punching

13:33.122 --> 13:35.591
a police officer,
and you don't wanna go down

13:35.624 --> 13:36.759
on a felony.

13:36.792 --> 13:38.827
You know what, Ellenor?

13:38.861 --> 13:40.963
I got rich relatives in Europe.

13:40.996 --> 13:43.066
They visit sometimes
when they come to Boston

13:43.099 --> 13:45.834
to see musicians and stuff,
and they're snooty.

13:46.869 --> 13:48.471
I'm not sure that's relevant.

13:48.504 --> 13:50.973
No, I'm getting to it.

13:51.006 --> 13:52.675
They're snooty
about their money,

13:52.708 --> 13:53.609
about their country,

13:53.642 --> 13:55.544
about their intellectual
whatever,

13:55.578 --> 13:57.746
and they look down on me.

13:57.780 --> 13:59.482
And you know what I tell them,

13:59.515 --> 14:02.425
what I say I got that
they don't got?

14:02.458 --> 14:05.028
America.

14:05.061 --> 14:08.031
A true democracy,
real freedom.

14:08.064 --> 14:10.133
And I don't mean to be sound
like Patrick Henry

14:10.166 --> 14:11.667
and all those dead presidents.

14:11.700 --> 14:13.869
Patrick Henry
was never a president.

14:13.902 --> 14:17.473
But to be able to vote,
to protest,

14:17.506 --> 14:19.342
to do all the things
we went to Iraq

14:19.375 --> 14:22.445
to give the Iraqi people
the chance to do,

14:22.478 --> 14:24.913
it means something.

14:24.947 --> 14:27.216
I went to that motorcade
to voice my opinion,

14:27.250 --> 14:28.451
nothing more.

14:28.484 --> 14:31.454
That cop told me
that I couldn't do that.

14:31.487 --> 14:33.589
Now, maybe I shouldn't
have hit him,

14:33.622 --> 14:35.991
but I will
not plead out on this.

14:36.025 --> 14:39.262
I have not yet begun
to fight.

14:39.295 --> 14:41.464
John Paul Jones
or somebody said that.

14:42.531 --> 14:43.566
Was he a president?

14:45.334 --> 14:46.402
No.

14:47.936 --> 14:51.307
I can't walk away
from this, Ellenor.

14:51.340 --> 14:53.509
This isn't right.

14:53.542 --> 14:56.379
And I need you
to fight for me.

15:03.226 --> 15:05.894
I'm not necessarily
defending him on the merits.

15:05.928 --> 15:07.096
YOUNG: How can that be?

15:07.130 --> 15:08.131
You're a lawyer.

15:08.164 --> 15:09.898
He hired you as his lawyer.

15:09.932 --> 15:11.834
How can you not defend
him on the merits?

15:11.867 --> 15:14.370
I don't know
all the facts, Eugene.

15:14.403 --> 15:16.172
But let's assume,
for the sake of argument,

15:16.205 --> 15:17.240
the discharge was justified.

15:17.273 --> 15:18.141
It was.

15:18.174 --> 15:19.842
Well, from my understanding,

15:19.875 --> 15:22.178
some of the worst things he did
he did in the beginning,

15:22.211 --> 15:23.412
which you knew about.

15:24.547 --> 15:27.183
Which means he may have
some estoppel arguments.

15:27.216 --> 15:28.484
BERLUTI: Just because
we may have known

15:28.517 --> 15:29.585
some of the stuff he was up to,

15:29.618 --> 15:31.954
that doesn't mean
we sanctioned it.

15:31.987 --> 15:33.289
I'm not suggesting that.

15:33.322 --> 15:35.023
Then what are you suggesting?

15:35.058 --> 15:36.325
You took the money.

15:38.894 --> 15:40.463
It doesn't seem fair
that you would profit

15:40.496 --> 15:42.465
from the very conduct you're
now citing as the cause.

15:42.498 --> 15:43.266
I'm done.

15:44.167 --> 15:46.735
Done? You just sat down.

15:46.769 --> 15:48.037
Let the man sue if he thinks
he's got a case.

15:48.071 --> 15:49.105
I'm ready.

15:49.138 --> 15:50.706
That kind of emotion suggests

15:50.739 --> 15:52.441
that you might be personalizing
this a little.

15:55.644 --> 15:56.979
Take a look around,
Mr. Billings.

15:58.347 --> 15:59.848
This is a firm
I've given the last

15:59.882 --> 16:01.990
15 years of my life to.

16:02.025 --> 16:05.061
Your client, Alan Shore,
devalued that.

16:05.094 --> 16:06.762
I take it personally.

16:06.795 --> 16:09.765
I'm not ashamed to take
that personally.

16:23.479 --> 16:26.749
All you need to know,
Eugene, I won't lose.

16:28.884 --> 16:30.719
As senior partner,
I recognize

16:30.753 --> 16:32.755
it would be in the best
interest of the firm

16:32.788 --> 16:35.124
to work this out
quietly and quickly,

16:35.158 --> 16:36.592
but you know what?

16:36.625 --> 16:37.793
Let's fight, Alan.

16:39.028 --> 16:41.730
I wanna go to Court,
lower myself into the trenches,

16:41.764 --> 16:44.333
and have the kind
of street war I'm capable of,

16:44.367 --> 16:45.334
but not to worry...

16:46.835 --> 16:48.971
because you won't lose.

17:00.483 --> 17:03.026
My advice is to walk away.

17:05.194 --> 17:07.829
Hey, you and I could
start a firm,

17:07.863 --> 17:09.397
assuming I pass the bar,
that is.

17:09.432 --> 17:10.833
Think how exciting
that would be.

17:12.435 --> 17:13.336
What is with my head?

17:13.368 --> 17:14.837
I'm feeling drunk.

17:14.869 --> 17:16.003
Is it possible to get drunk

17:16.039 --> 17:17.540
off one shot of liqueur?

17:17.573 --> 17:19.541
Probably not,
but I've been pouring vodka

17:19.575 --> 17:22.045
in your drink, so...
Alan.

17:22.078 --> 17:24.646
I was hoping it
would lead to intercourse.

17:24.680 --> 17:27.450
In times of stress,
I find solace in warm,

17:27.483 --> 17:28.416
dark places.

17:28.451 --> 17:32.020
Slipping me liquor
to get me into bed,

17:32.055 --> 17:33.056
that's date rape.

17:33.089 --> 17:34.757
Oh, don't be so trendy.

17:34.790 --> 17:36.125
No, really, it's not funny.

17:36.159 --> 17:38.027
Is that the reason
why you showed up here?

17:38.061 --> 17:41.930
I wouldn't have actually
slept with you, Tara.

17:41.964 --> 17:43.299
It's more
about knowing I can.

17:43.332 --> 17:47.203
It's the conquest,
with no fear of infection.

17:52.141 --> 17:54.977
Alan, are you interested
in a relationship with me?

17:58.581 --> 17:59.948
You need not worry
about it happening.

17:59.982 --> 18:01.490
I'd never actually let it.

18:03.759 --> 18:07.496
So I'm offering you
a rare bite at honesty.

18:07.530 --> 18:09.732
Are you interested in me?

18:13.336 --> 18:15.338
I find you very interesting.

18:19.108 --> 18:21.277
You and I would
last a week, Tara.

18:21.310 --> 18:24.147
It'd be an absolutely
glorious week, but no.

18:27.216 --> 18:29.718
I'm only here now
because Ellenor's in trial,

18:29.752 --> 18:31.554
and I hate
getting drunk alone.

18:38.394 --> 18:41.297
I do have a friend, though.

18:41.330 --> 18:43.166
A friend?

18:43.199 --> 18:44.867
She saw me with you
one night,

18:44.900 --> 18:48.404
and she couldn't stop
going on and on about...

18:49.672 --> 18:51.640
what it must be
like to kiss you.

18:51.674 --> 18:54.810
Your friend's a she, even.

18:54.843 --> 18:58.614
She had some
ridiculous idea that--

19:00.183 --> 19:01.957
I don't know,

19:01.990 --> 19:05.461
those lips were different from--

19:10.633 --> 19:12.168
"Lips are lips," I said.

19:12.201 --> 19:15.571
And since most people
close their eyes while kissing,

19:15.604 --> 19:20.609
it really doesn't matter
who or what.

19:26.249 --> 19:27.416
More vodka?

19:36.659 --> 19:38.194
You seem
a little fragile.

19:47.870 --> 19:49.472
Paul did it, you know.

19:55.711 --> 19:56.545
I'm sorry?

19:56.579 --> 19:57.946
Paul Stewart.

19:59.815 --> 20:01.257
He killed Brenda Wilbur.

20:08.597 --> 20:10.733
Everything turns out
badly in the end.

20:13.569 --> 20:15.904
That's the only life
lesson one needs.

20:21.210 --> 20:23.946
Anyway, I'm sorry
to have intruded.

20:29.918 --> 20:31.687
I don't think
you should drive.

20:31.720 --> 20:32.521
SHORE: I took a car.

20:32.555 --> 20:34.890
It wasn't mine,
so I'm sure the police

20:34.923 --> 20:37.360
are out there,
but they'll give me a lift.

20:46.469 --> 20:48.637
You do know that you
and I wouldn't work?

20:48.671 --> 20:51.407
I do.

20:51.440 --> 20:53.876
You're not nearly
tawdry enough for me.

20:57.146 --> 20:57.980
Good night.

21:16.839 --> 21:18.274
For your friend,

21:20.209 --> 21:22.411
and whoever else
might be curious.

21:26.315 --> 21:27.683
Good night.

21:29.052 --> 21:30.053
Tara--

21:31.920 --> 21:34.057
relax, I don't want
the key to your heart.

21:35.023 --> 21:36.359
Just the office.

21:38.194 --> 21:39.128
Excuse me?

21:39.162 --> 21:42.131
They changed the locks,

21:42.165 --> 21:45.068
but the master key
should still work

21:45.101 --> 21:46.469
and you have it,

21:46.502 --> 21:47.470
don't you, Tara?

21:47.503 --> 21:50.439
(music playing)

21:59.515 --> 22:01.290
Did you call Eugene?

22:01.324 --> 22:02.858
I had to. I can't get in.

22:02.891 --> 22:03.892
I considered
calling the police.

22:04.027 --> 22:04.960
(elevator dings)

22:06.262 --> 22:07.430
HATCHER: I got here at 8:00.

22:07.463 --> 22:08.997
It was already like this.

22:12.101 --> 22:14.403
It's a new lock
and a new master.

22:14.437 --> 22:15.371
(sighs)

22:16.772 --> 22:17.806
BERLUTI:
This is trespassing.

22:17.840 --> 22:19.675
We can arrest him
for this.

22:22.145 --> 22:23.279
Oh, hello.

22:24.480 --> 22:25.848
Gosh, we're not open yet.

22:25.881 --> 22:27.350
Please come back
at 9:00.

22:29.652 --> 22:30.953
It's almost 9:00.

22:30.986 --> 22:33.889
Jimmy, file a trespassing
report with the police.

22:33.922 --> 22:36.392
Jamie, Lucy,
let's draft the TRO.

22:36.425 --> 22:38.327
He's in there
collecting client files.

22:39.195 --> 22:41.097
Now, then,
who has business?

22:43.899 --> 22:46.102
Perhaps a slight explanation
is in order.

22:46.135 --> 22:49.272
I'm invoking the doctrine
partnership by estoppel.

22:49.305 --> 22:51.607
It's a well-defined theory
under Massachusetts law.

22:51.640 --> 22:52.641
I'm sure you know it.

22:52.675 --> 22:54.910
Given the huge imbalance

22:54.943 --> 22:56.812
with respect to billables,

22:56.845 --> 22:59.148
I took it upon myself
to declare me

22:59.182 --> 23:00.015
as senior partner.

23:00.049 --> 23:01.224
Imagine.

23:02.158 --> 23:04.360
Good news is I've decided
to keep you on, Eugene,

23:04.393 --> 23:05.628
in an associate position.

23:05.661 --> 23:08.697
Bad news, Jimmy,
it's not working out.

23:08.731 --> 23:10.066
Get out of my firm.

23:10.099 --> 23:11.400
Your firm?

23:12.435 --> 23:14.803
You pay office rent,
Eugene.

23:14.837 --> 23:15.904
You lease the equipment.

23:15.938 --> 23:17.406
As for the clients,

23:17.440 --> 23:19.075
keep yours,
I'll keep mine.

23:19.108 --> 23:21.677
Let's do the math.
I will physically throw you out.

23:21.710 --> 23:24.480
Please do.
STRINGER: Hey, come on.

23:26.715 --> 23:28.517
Look, Alan, obviously,

23:28.551 --> 23:29.985
you're trying
to provoke something.

23:30.018 --> 23:31.454
What, you think you have
a better legal case

23:31.487 --> 23:32.421
if Eugene attacks you?

23:32.455 --> 23:33.522
It wouldn't get worse.

23:34.257 --> 23:35.424
STRINGER: This is ridiculous.

23:35.458 --> 23:37.860
Challenge the firing
if you want,

23:37.893 --> 23:39.495
but you can't just
break in,

23:39.528 --> 23:41.264
change the locks,
and take over the firm.

23:41.297 --> 23:43.832
I did take over the firm
while I was here, so...

23:43.866 --> 23:44.733
Okay, fine.

23:44.767 --> 23:46.169
If that's true,
have a Judge declare it,

23:46.202 --> 23:48.771
but this is like some
military coup.

23:48.804 --> 23:49.838
Be reasonable.

23:52.841 --> 23:54.077
I'm persuaded.

23:56.445 --> 23:57.980
I'll let the Judge decide.

24:04.027 --> 24:05.028
(elevator dings)

24:09.298 --> 24:11.367
What the hell?

24:11.400 --> 24:13.436
He obviously got
what he came for.

24:18.006 --> 24:19.542
FRUTT: On March 7th,

24:19.575 --> 24:22.145
there was a presidential
motorcade in Boston.

24:22.178 --> 24:24.980
Hundreds of thousands
of people came out,

24:25.013 --> 24:27.015
some carrying signs
in support

24:27.050 --> 24:28.617
of the commander-in-chief,

24:28.651 --> 24:30.519
some waving placards
in protest.

24:31.154 --> 24:32.988
The ones protesting

24:33.021 --> 24:36.459
were removed
under the threat of arrest.

24:36.492 --> 24:37.926
The ones in support

24:37.960 --> 24:39.462
were allowed to stay.

24:41.264 --> 24:42.565
What's happening to us?

24:43.666 --> 24:46.802
I realize we live in
a different world since 9/11.

24:46.835 --> 24:49.638
Certain liberties,
we just have to forfeit.

24:49.672 --> 24:51.807
Search our luggage
at airports,

24:51.840 --> 24:53.776
conduct racial profiling,

24:53.809 --> 24:55.978
put up cameras to watch us
on street corners,

24:56.011 --> 24:57.646
none of us like any of it,

24:57.680 --> 24:59.815
but we have to understand,

25:02.058 --> 25:05.394
but silence our voices?

25:05.428 --> 25:07.663
Make it a crime to engage

25:07.696 --> 25:09.432
in political dissent?

25:09.465 --> 25:13.936
Segregate people based on
the content of their ideas?

25:13.969 --> 25:16.039
And it's not just going on
in the government.

25:16.072 --> 25:17.606
Let's look at television,

25:17.640 --> 25:18.807
the Super Bowl,
for example.

25:19.642 --> 25:22.311
They bombarded us
with ads on beer,

25:22.345 --> 25:23.879
erectile dysfunction.

25:23.912 --> 25:26.182
It's okay to see
dogs biting crotches

25:26.215 --> 25:27.250
and farting donkeys,

25:27.283 --> 25:29.185
let alone the half-time show,

25:29.218 --> 25:33.021
but a spot containing
political content,

25:33.056 --> 25:35.391
that has to be shut down.

25:36.592 --> 25:39.995
What is happening
to this country?

25:41.497 --> 25:44.467
Historically, we have
always been a nation

25:44.500 --> 25:46.835
that has championed the idea.

25:46.869 --> 25:50.573
Today, if the government
doesn't like your idea,

25:50.606 --> 25:53.142
you can be cordoned off
to a designated zone,

25:53.176 --> 25:56.245
where it is guaranteed
to get no exposure.

25:56.279 --> 25:59.382
It goes against America,

25:59.415 --> 26:01.190
against the constitution,

26:01.224 --> 26:03.392
against the principles
we fought for

26:03.426 --> 26:06.595
in every war throughout
our nation's history.

26:06.629 --> 26:09.498
Of course,
Carrie Moses felt rage.

26:09.532 --> 26:10.699
Where's yours?

26:11.600 --> 26:14.002
Where's yours

26:14.037 --> 26:15.438
and yours.

26:20.109 --> 26:23.011
Edward R. Murrow once said,

26:23.046 --> 26:25.114
"We must never confuse

26:25.148 --> 26:27.750
dissent with disloyalty."

26:29.818 --> 26:33.789
We have either become
a country of oppression,

26:33.822 --> 26:36.892
or we are just
very, very confused.

26:40.429 --> 26:42.931
As Carrie herself said,

26:44.167 --> 26:45.601
"Free- speech zone?

26:46.735 --> 26:49.672
Why isn't the whole country

26:49.705 --> 26:51.240
a free-speech zone?"

27:06.895 --> 27:10.199
Ms. Moses punched
a police officer.

27:10.233 --> 27:12.701
The crime she committed
was assault,

27:12.735 --> 27:15.071
for which she has no defense,
by the way,

27:16.539 --> 27:17.940
which, of course,
is the reason Ms. Frutt

27:17.973 --> 27:19.475
just filibustered all of us

27:19.508 --> 27:22.911
on the principles
of individual freedoms.

27:22.945 --> 27:26.415
But since Ms. Frutt has raised
the constitutionality

27:26.449 --> 27:29.252
of the free-speech zones,

27:29.285 --> 27:31.454
we live in a country

27:31.487 --> 27:33.522
where presidents
get attacked.

27:34.457 --> 27:35.758
In my lifetime,

27:35.791 --> 27:38.761
I saw President Kennedy
get shot,

27:38.794 --> 27:40.763
his brother Robert assassinated

27:40.796 --> 27:42.565
running for president.

27:42.598 --> 27:44.433
President Ford
was nearly shot.

27:44.467 --> 27:46.702
President Reagan was shot.

27:46.735 --> 27:48.437
And that was before 9/11.

27:49.472 --> 27:50.473
The whole terrorist world

27:50.506 --> 27:54.177
would love to see
President Bush dead.

27:54.210 --> 27:57.280
Vice President Cheney
has to live in secret hiding,

27:57.313 --> 27:59.348
so real is the threat.

28:00.516 --> 28:03.626
Are we really being
that unreasonable

28:03.659 --> 28:06.429
to impose strict
security measures,

28:06.462 --> 28:08.464
perhaps even
overreaching ones?

28:09.332 --> 28:12.668
Now, just like Ms. Frutt,

28:12.701 --> 28:14.970
I would love
to go back to the world

28:15.003 --> 28:17.340
that we used to live in,

28:17.373 --> 28:19.808
where we didn't have
yellow, orange,

28:19.842 --> 28:21.344
and red alerts,

28:21.377 --> 28:24.780
we didn't have to X-ray
people's shoes at airports,

28:24.813 --> 28:27.050
where we didn't have
to guard bridges.

28:28.217 --> 28:29.985
The New York police force

28:30.018 --> 28:32.155
currently is going
through training

28:32.188 --> 28:36.024
in preparation
for a nuclear attack.

28:36.059 --> 28:38.761
Of course it's nice

28:38.794 --> 28:41.764
to lament the loss
of our old world.

28:43.432 --> 28:45.834
But we have to live
in this one.

28:51.240 --> 28:52.007
(elevator dings)

28:52.041 --> 28:53.142
You tell me
you wanna settle,

28:53.176 --> 28:54.143
then you break
into their office.

28:54.177 --> 28:55.544
Only to download
the books.

28:55.578 --> 28:56.545
That's illegal.

28:56.579 --> 28:57.946
And why did you change
the name on the door?

28:57.980 --> 28:59.014
Okay, that part was fun.

28:59.048 --> 29:00.483
I'm not gonna
represent you, Alan,

29:00.516 --> 29:01.924
if this is how
you're going to behave.

29:01.957 --> 29:03.559
What's with the red tie,
soldier?

29:03.592 --> 29:04.760
Denny.
SHORE: I beg your pardon?

29:04.793 --> 29:06.529
Around here,
we wear cold ties,

29:06.562 --> 29:07.463
blue, black,

29:07.496 --> 29:09.198
hard colors, tough colors.

29:09.232 --> 29:11.534
Red is soft.

29:11.567 --> 29:14.870
Soft does not work
around here, sailor.

29:14.903 --> 29:16.705
This is Alan Shore, Denny.

29:16.739 --> 29:18.074
He's not
an attorney here.

29:18.107 --> 29:19.975
He's a client.

29:20.008 --> 29:22.111
Oh.

29:22.145 --> 29:24.012
Red's a soft color, pilgrim.

29:26.782 --> 29:27.883
That's Denny Crane?

29:27.916 --> 29:29.885
The Denny Crane?
Don't be fooled.

29:29.918 --> 29:31.154
Once he's in the Courtroom,

29:31.187 --> 29:32.588
he's every bit the icon.

29:33.922 --> 29:35.758
Now, can we get back to you?

29:35.791 --> 29:36.959
They've moved for a TRO

29:36.992 --> 29:38.961
before Judge Gleason
tomorrow.

29:38.994 --> 29:41.097
What's this I hear on Ryan?

29:41.130 --> 29:41.864
BILLINGS:
He's holding at 120.

29:41.897 --> 29:43.232
His attorney's due
in any second.

29:43.266 --> 29:44.667
Send him into my office,
will you?

29:44.700 --> 29:47.103
Yeah.
Good man, Gleason.

29:47.136 --> 29:48.604
Shot ducks with him
on Saturday.

29:48.637 --> 29:50.005
He's a good man.

29:52.375 --> 29:54.077
As you can see, I'm in
the middle of something,

29:54.110 --> 29:55.978
so maybe we should
just resched--

29:56.011 --> 29:56.679
SHORE: Mr. Crane,

29:56.712 --> 29:58.781
Denny, hello.

29:58.814 --> 30:00.283
Alan Shore.

30:00.316 --> 30:01.824
Warm tie.
Oh, sure,

30:01.857 --> 30:03.926
I know who you are.
I just spoke to you.

30:03.959 --> 30:05.794
Excellent. I wasn't sure
I'd made an impression.

30:05.828 --> 30:07.463
Did I hear you say
you duck hunt

30:07.496 --> 30:10.099
with Judge Gleason?
Yeah. Good man.

30:10.133 --> 30:11.700
Great shot.

30:11.734 --> 30:12.435
You shoot?

30:12.468 --> 30:14.103
Do I shoot?
Hmm.

30:14.137 --> 30:15.338
Huh, let me tell you,

30:15.371 --> 30:16.272
do I shoot?

30:17.773 --> 30:19.375
Can I talk to you
for a minute?

30:22.178 --> 30:23.546
Why does the door...

30:25.181 --> 30:26.382
Don't ask.

30:28.184 --> 30:28.951
What happened?

30:28.984 --> 30:30.819
He got the master key,

30:30.853 --> 30:32.421
we think from Tara.

30:32.455 --> 30:34.590
He downloaded
the financial records

30:34.623 --> 30:37.260
and accounts receivables.

30:37.293 --> 30:38.694
He also...

30:40.829 --> 30:41.897
Also what?

30:43.532 --> 30:44.867
All of our clients

30:44.900 --> 30:46.235
got this e-mail.

30:48.071 --> 30:51.040
WOMAN (over screen): Alert.
Wardrobe malfunction. Alert.

30:56.011 --> 30:57.012
Where's Eugene?

30:57.046 --> 30:59.482
He's in his office.

30:59.515 --> 31:01.890
We have a TRO
scheduled for tomorrow.

31:15.138 --> 31:16.639
He took records?

31:16.672 --> 31:18.807
Yup, and he mangled
our system,

31:18.841 --> 31:20.809
so we're having trouble
pulling stuff up.

31:22.545 --> 31:24.347
I'm sorry for--

31:28.617 --> 31:29.985
Do you blame me for this?

31:30.018 --> 31:31.320
You vouched for the man.

31:31.354 --> 31:32.555
I certainly didn't think--

31:32.588 --> 31:34.457
You vouched
for his character.

31:34.490 --> 31:36.192
And after all the crap
he's pulled,

31:36.225 --> 31:37.526
he's now broken
into our office,

31:37.560 --> 31:38.661
stolen files--
Eugene, I--

31:38.694 --> 31:42.098
You spoke for that
man's character,

31:42.131 --> 31:45.368
and he's held us
up to disgrace.

31:45.401 --> 31:48.304
Now we're gonna have to endure
a big public spectacle of...

31:53.276 --> 31:55.010
I certainly didn't
see this coming.

31:55.044 --> 31:57.646
That's the difference
between us.

31:57.680 --> 31:59.515
I did.

31:59.548 --> 32:00.923
And I still...

32:05.661 --> 32:07.530
So, what's happening now?

32:10.633 --> 32:13.202
What's happening now is
we're going into Court,

32:13.236 --> 32:14.770
trying to enjoin him

32:14.803 --> 32:17.040
from taking
any of our clients.

32:17.073 --> 32:18.507
What's happening now,
Ellenor,

32:18.541 --> 32:20.109
is the beginning of a war.

32:21.977 --> 32:23.712
And what's happening now,

32:25.281 --> 32:27.616
you have to choose a side.

32:27.650 --> 32:29.452
You can't be
on the fence anymore.

32:31.054 --> 32:32.321
Eugene,

32:32.355 --> 32:35.058
you know I'm on your side.

32:35.791 --> 32:36.725
Do I?

32:39.728 --> 32:43.499
We need to vilify this man
in open Court, Ellenor.

32:43.532 --> 32:44.700
Look me in the eye

32:44.733 --> 32:47.002
and tell me
you're prepared to do that.

32:54.810 --> 32:56.011
SHORE: Partnership by Estoppel,

32:56.045 --> 32:58.114
we get the Court to declare me
as a partner.

32:58.147 --> 32:59.482
There's precedent
under Massachusetts law.

32:59.515 --> 33:01.957
Are you Jewish?

33:01.990 --> 33:03.326
Am I Jewish?
Best bet,

33:03.359 --> 33:06.895
we argue they fired you
because you're a Jew.

33:06.929 --> 33:08.331
No defense against that.

33:08.364 --> 33:09.598
Well, I would
ordinarily agree,

33:09.632 --> 33:12.168
but they didn't fire me
for that,

33:12.201 --> 33:14.470
and I'm not Jewish.

33:14.503 --> 33:15.638
I didn't hear that.

33:15.671 --> 33:16.639
(knocks on door)

33:17.506 --> 33:19.275
Mr. Crane?

33:19.308 --> 33:20.209
Stan Brenner.

33:20.243 --> 33:21.344
Matthew Billings
said you wanna see me.

33:21.377 --> 33:22.845
Yeah, come in.

33:23.712 --> 33:24.913
(door closes)

33:26.849 --> 33:28.884
I'm told you're holding
at 120.

33:30.786 --> 33:32.020
The man died, son.

33:32.055 --> 33:34.057
Well, as I explained
to Mr. Billings,

33:34.090 --> 33:36.192
there are some serious
liability problems.

33:36.225 --> 33:37.993
I don't wanna hear about
liability problems.

33:39.362 --> 33:40.863
Mr. Billings explained
that Marie Senate

33:40.896 --> 33:43.566
is one of my oldest
and dearest friends,

33:43.599 --> 33:45.768
that I'm like a brother
to her late husband.

33:46.769 --> 33:49.172
It was actually
the brother who died,

33:49.205 --> 33:50.139
not the husband.

33:50.673 --> 33:51.507
DENNY: Really?

33:51.540 --> 33:53.076
You know what?

33:53.109 --> 33:55.378
Medical records aside,

33:55.411 --> 33:57.313
if Denny Crane
tells the jury

33:57.346 --> 33:58.314
it was the husband,

33:58.347 --> 33:59.648
they'll believe
it was the husband.

34:02.958 --> 34:05.561
I play poker with
Charlie Levine.

34:05.594 --> 34:07.696
Charlie still head up
litigation at your firm?

34:07.730 --> 34:09.264
Yes, he does.

34:10.433 --> 34:11.699
Hell of a guy, Charlie.

34:15.071 --> 34:16.039
Listen,

34:18.440 --> 34:20.909
we're gonna raise
your last counter to 142,

34:20.943 --> 34:23.011
and I'm gonna whisper
in Charlie's ear

34:23.045 --> 34:24.813
what a fine young associate
he's got in you,

34:24.847 --> 34:26.815
and Charlie respects
my opinion.

34:26.849 --> 34:27.516
You know why?

34:27.550 --> 34:28.951
Not because we're friends,

34:28.984 --> 34:29.717
but because...

34:31.219 --> 34:32.521
I'm Denny Crane.

34:33.755 --> 34:34.889
You knew that, didn't you?

34:35.757 --> 34:37.360
Denny Crane?

34:37.393 --> 34:39.928
(chuckles)
Good-looking kid.

34:40.596 --> 34:42.531
I'll bet later tonight

34:42.565 --> 34:44.699
you'll be on some
barroom stool

34:44.733 --> 34:45.701
trying to finesse your way

34:45.734 --> 34:47.703
into some legal
secretary's panties.

34:48.504 --> 34:49.938
You wanna get there
faster, son?

34:50.739 --> 34:53.708
Tell her earlier you held Court
with Denny Crane.

34:56.212 --> 34:57.580
Denny Crane.

34:58.747 --> 35:00.549
(chuckles)

35:00.583 --> 35:02.125
SHORE: He's a whack job.

35:02.158 --> 35:03.759
BILLINGS: He's eccentric.
Eccentric?

35:03.792 --> 35:05.161
He's asking me
to plead Jewish.

35:05.194 --> 35:07.030
You hired him.
Why didn't you stop me?

35:07.063 --> 35:07.896
You went running off
before I even--

35:07.930 --> 35:10.633
You need to argue
this motion.

35:10.666 --> 35:12.135
Alan, I promise you,

35:12.168 --> 35:15.238
once he stands up
in Court...

35:15.271 --> 35:16.872
SHORE: What? Once he stands up
in Court, what?

35:16.905 --> 35:18.074
He's Denny Crane.

35:18.107 --> 35:20.076
Oh, my God.
No, really.

35:21.744 --> 35:23.179
He's Denny Crane.

35:30.953 --> 35:32.855
CRANE: What do you mean
you'll do the arguing?

35:32.888 --> 35:34.757
Since I know the case best,
I thought--

35:34.790 --> 35:36.459
CRANE: You hired Denny Crane.

35:36.492 --> 35:38.294
SHORE: I did,
and I want to reserve

35:38.327 --> 35:40.896
your thunder for later.

35:40.929 --> 35:43.666
For now,
I want you to sit there

35:43.699 --> 35:45.000
as the big cannon.

35:45.034 --> 35:46.402
I want your aura.

35:46.435 --> 35:49.272
I want you to exude

35:49.305 --> 35:52.208
the power of esteemed,

35:52.241 --> 35:55.078
noble duck hunter.

35:55.111 --> 35:57.513
You don't want me to talk?

35:57.546 --> 35:58.914
Not this early
in the case.

35:58.947 --> 36:00.316
It would be premature.

36:00.349 --> 36:01.990
For today--

36:02.024 --> 36:04.193
look, I've got
my dark tie on.

36:04.227 --> 36:05.328
I'm ready.

36:07.396 --> 36:10.333
(music playing)

36:17.240 --> 36:19.342
I'm feeling nervous.

36:19.375 --> 36:20.276
How much longer?

36:20.309 --> 36:21.310
Soon.

36:21.344 --> 36:23.146
I'm feeling nervous.

36:24.613 --> 36:26.215
CLARKE: Madam Foreperson,

36:26.249 --> 36:28.051
the jury has reached
a unanimous verdict?

36:28.084 --> 36:29.652
We have, Your Honor.

36:29.685 --> 36:31.520
Will the defendant
please rise?

36:33.922 --> 36:35.023
What say you?

36:36.159 --> 36:38.827
Case number 75421,

36:38.861 --> 36:41.730
in the matter of the
Commonwealth vs. Carrie Moses.

36:41.764 --> 36:44.033
On the charge
of aggravated assault

36:44.067 --> 36:45.901
against a police officer,

36:46.369 --> 36:48.404
we find the defendant,
Carrie Moses,

36:49.405 --> 36:50.339
guilty.

36:51.340 --> 36:52.175
Piss!

36:53.409 --> 36:54.877
CLARKE: Ms. Moses,
you've been found guilty.

36:54.910 --> 36:56.812
Now, on a matter
of sentencing--

36:56.845 --> 36:58.013
FRUTT: Hold on.

36:58.047 --> 36:59.615
We're doing sentencing now?

36:59.648 --> 37:01.157
CLARKE:
Yes, we are, Ms. Frutt.

37:01.190 --> 37:04.026
The crime for which you have
been convicted is very serious,

37:04.060 --> 37:06.162
and the Court takes it
seriously,

37:06.195 --> 37:08.830
and accordingly,
I sentence you to eight years

37:08.864 --> 37:10.766
to be served
at Cedar Junction.

37:11.567 --> 37:13.535
Eight years
maximum security?

37:13.569 --> 37:16.172
CLARKE: People need to know
they just can't go around

37:16.205 --> 37:18.407
openly criticizing
our government,

37:18.440 --> 37:20.209
eroding our national unity.

37:20.243 --> 37:22.278
This is America, Ms. Moses.

37:22.311 --> 37:23.846
You dissent,

37:23.879 --> 37:25.281
you go to prison.

37:25.314 --> 37:27.183
Eight years, Cedars.

37:28.384 --> 37:29.185
Adjourned.

37:29.218 --> 37:30.186
(gavel bangs)

37:30.453 --> 37:32.121
(indistinct chatter)

37:35.158 --> 37:37.126
Ellenor, I'll lose my kids.

37:37.160 --> 37:38.294
I mean,
how could he do that?

37:38.327 --> 37:39.762
How can I get--
Take it easy, Carrie.

37:39.795 --> 37:42.731
That ruling was tailor-made
for a reversal.

37:42.765 --> 37:44.733
It's almost as if
he wanted to--

37:44.767 --> 37:46.402
(music playing)

38:02.825 --> 38:05.128
YOUNG: The fact that Mr. Shore
broke into our offices

38:05.161 --> 38:06.362
during the dark of night,

38:06.395 --> 38:08.331
to illegally access
our computer records,

38:08.364 --> 38:10.933
to steal and download
financial information,

38:10.966 --> 38:13.802
this conduct is evidence
of his moral turpitude,

38:13.836 --> 38:15.638
and accordingly--
Objection to the word,

38:15.671 --> 38:17.473
"turpitude".
I don't know what it means,

38:17.506 --> 38:20.109
and I especially
don't like "moral",

38:20.143 --> 38:21.610
it's ambiguous.

38:21.644 --> 38:23.412
GLEASON: Mr. Shore,
you'll get your turn.

38:23.446 --> 38:25.013
He's mocking
these proceedings

38:25.048 --> 38:26.849
the same way
he mocked our firm,

38:26.882 --> 38:29.085
the way he mocks the law.

38:29.118 --> 38:30.519
SHORE: Objection to the term
"law mocker."

38:30.553 --> 38:33.322
GLEASON: Mr. Shore, are you
taking this seriously or not?

38:33.356 --> 38:34.923
Your Honor, the firm was dying.

38:34.957 --> 38:37.093
Its name partner,
Bobby Donnell,

38:37.126 --> 38:38.194
walked out the door.

38:38.227 --> 38:39.595
They were hemorrhaging.

38:39.628 --> 38:42.198
I saved their
collective asses.

38:42.231 --> 38:43.632
That is categorically false.

38:43.666 --> 38:45.568
I've seen the books,
Eugene.

38:45.601 --> 38:47.136
You remember?
I stole them.

38:47.170 --> 38:49.572
Our firm has always been
financially viable.

38:49.605 --> 38:52.875
Our financial health has now
been jeopardized by him.

38:52.908 --> 38:55.211
Your Honor, this man
is a chest thumper. Watch.

38:55.244 --> 38:57.012
Yes, I chest thump
over ethics.

38:57.046 --> 38:57.946
Yes, I do.

38:57.980 --> 38:59.615
Hold on there, son.

39:00.856 --> 39:01.557
Denny Crane.

39:01.590 --> 39:03.626
YOUNG: I'm not finished.

39:03.659 --> 39:07.030
$9 million.

39:07.630 --> 39:08.731
I beg your pardon?

39:08.764 --> 39:11.400
Alan Shore's billables
exceeded $9 million,

39:11.434 --> 39:13.269
that in a period
of seven months.

39:13.302 --> 39:16.639
Beating all the other lawyers
combined by about $6.5 million.

39:16.672 --> 39:18.174
After they accepted
the money,

39:18.207 --> 39:20.909
after Al brought in clients

39:20.943 --> 39:24.613
amounting to 80%
of the corporate business,

39:24.647 --> 39:25.581
they threw him out.

39:25.614 --> 39:27.383
No profit participation,

39:27.416 --> 39:29.518
just a check for $15,000.

39:29.552 --> 39:32.421
It will be a testament

39:32.455 --> 39:34.557
to Mr. Young's powers
of persuasion

39:34.590 --> 39:36.325
if he can make that
sound good.

39:36.359 --> 39:37.793
So,

39:37.826 --> 39:40.896
I, like you,

39:40.929 --> 39:42.698
am looking forward
to what he has to say.

39:44.933 --> 39:45.968
Denny Crane.

39:52.308 --> 39:53.742
It's not that
I didn't appreciate

39:53.776 --> 39:55.278
your riveting performance,

39:55.311 --> 39:57.046
but I've mainly
retained you

39:57.080 --> 39:58.947
to sit at the table

39:58.981 --> 40:02.391
as honorary friend of Judge.

40:02.425 --> 40:04.727
Let me tell you
something, Tiger.

40:05.561 --> 40:06.295
Tiger?

40:06.329 --> 40:08.531
You want Denny Crane
to talk.

40:08.564 --> 40:09.998
When Denny Crane talks,

40:10.033 --> 40:11.467
E.F. Hutton listens.

40:11.500 --> 40:13.001
My presence alone--

40:13.036 --> 40:15.504
my presence
is so powerful,

40:15.538 --> 40:16.872
I don't even
have to talk.

40:16.905 --> 40:18.774
Sometimes I'm better
when I don't talk.

40:18.807 --> 40:20.376
This was my thinking.

40:20.409 --> 40:22.378
I'm Denny Crane, damn it.

40:22.911 --> 40:24.012
(door opens)

40:25.048 --> 40:26.249
The Judge is back.

40:27.350 --> 40:30.286
(music playing)

40:38.194 --> 40:39.395
Well,

40:39.428 --> 40:40.329
Mr. Shore,

40:41.197 --> 40:42.665
you're going into the files,

40:42.698 --> 40:45.234
changing the name on the door,

40:45.268 --> 40:46.402
futzing up the computers

40:46.435 --> 40:48.871
so they can't access records,

40:48.904 --> 40:51.140
that was a real low, dirty,

40:51.174 --> 40:54.543
sneaky, sleazy thing to do.

40:54.577 --> 40:55.978
But...

40:56.011 --> 40:59.048
GLEASON:
But it begs the question,

41:00.956 --> 41:02.791
whose firm is it really?

41:02.825 --> 41:04.960
A law firm isn't just a name.

41:04.993 --> 41:06.662
It's a business.

41:06.695 --> 41:09.365
Most of the business
seems to be Alan Shore's.

41:09.398 --> 41:11.334
Without a contract,

41:11.367 --> 41:13.902
we need to hear evidence.

41:13.936 --> 41:16.505
I haven't got enough before me
to find likelihood of success

41:16.539 --> 41:18.041
on the merits for either side.

41:18.074 --> 41:21.710
So no injunctive relief
will be ordered today.

41:21.744 --> 41:23.446
I'm scheduling

41:23.479 --> 41:25.514
an evidentiary hearing
for next week.

41:25.548 --> 41:28.484
We'll reconvene
on Monday, 10:00.

41:29.385 --> 41:30.719
We'll take off our gloves

41:30.753 --> 41:31.954
and have at it.

41:32.788 --> 41:34.390
After that,

41:34.423 --> 41:36.392
I suspect some of you
will be in business

41:36.425 --> 41:38.361
and others won't.

41:40.096 --> 41:41.430
Until then.

41:41.464 --> 41:44.400
(music playing)

42:06.062 --> 42:08.997
(music playing)

42:32.155 --> 42:33.356
WOMAN: You stinker!

42:33.656 --> 42:36.592
(music playing)
