00:36.787 --> 00:38.038
Close the valve!

00:38.163 --> 00:39.623
Before the fire comes!

00:49.341 --> 00:50.551
There she is!

00:50.801 --> 00:53.470
She has the seeds!
Get her!

01:19.830 --> 01:21.915
Don't just stand there!
Go get her!

02:49.920 --> 02:57.177
<i>Mary and The Witch's Flower</i>

03:24.538 --> 03:25.789
I'm so bored!

03:26.289 --> 03:29.793
Mary, have you finished unpacking?

03:31.878 --> 03:33.964
I'm working on it!

03:39.845 --> 03:41.972
Oh, no...

03:42.139 --> 03:45.142
I've only made things worse...

03:53.692 --> 03:56.903
Hello, I'm Mary Smith.
I just transferred here.

04:04.578 --> 04:05.996
I hate my hair.

04:07.664 --> 04:11.251
Lunch is ready!
Come on down!

04:11.376 --> 04:12.502
Coming!

04:16.339 --> 04:19.176
I wonder if she's all unpacked.

04:19.551 --> 04:21.011
Oh, I doubt it.

04:21.511 --> 04:25.098
The boxes were still
stacked high this morning.

04:29.019 --> 04:31.354
Good morning, Great-Aunt Charlotte.

04:31.521 --> 04:32.689
Good morning.

04:32.898 --> 04:35.108
Miss Banks, please let me help.

04:37.861 --> 04:39.362
It's all right.

04:40.071 --> 04:42.866
Thank you, the tea was delicious.

04:45.577 --> 04:47.037
I can take that.

04:53.919 --> 04:55.212
Oh, my.

04:55.754 --> 04:57.547
I... I'm sorry.

04:59.257 --> 05:02.260
Like I said, it's quite all right.

05:03.929 --> 05:04.971
Yes, ma'am.

05:06.890 --> 05:09.142
Oh, Great-Aunt Charlotte.

05:10.560 --> 05:11.812
Thank you.

05:14.564 --> 05:17.526
Isn't there anything
I can help with?

05:19.236 --> 05:21.071
Maybe that embroidery...

05:21.780 --> 05:23.740
is too difficult for me.

05:25.242 --> 05:27.911
You must be bored being with old folks.

05:28.286 --> 05:31.164
Well, I didn't mean that...

05:32.624 --> 05:35.836
There's no TV, no video games here.

05:36.586 --> 05:38.588
But we do have a TV.

05:38.755 --> 05:40.423
It's broken, though.

05:44.928 --> 05:47.347
Oh my, it really is broken.

05:48.473 --> 05:50.600
We'll get it fixed soon.

05:50.767 --> 05:52.018
That'll be nice.

05:52.602 --> 05:56.606
Say, your dad and mum
called last night.

05:56.773 --> 05:58.525
Really? They're coming soon?

05:58.650 --> 06:03.280
Their work isn't finished,
so it'll be a while longer.

06:03.613 --> 06:05.198
Oh...

06:05.615 --> 06:08.368
Good thing you came here early.

06:09.160 --> 06:13.707
If you'd come with them,
you would've been late for school.

06:14.833 --> 06:16.793
There's still a week left.

06:17.168 --> 06:18.712
It'll fly by.

06:19.170 --> 06:24.968
Once summer is over,
the village will be teeming with kids.

06:25.802 --> 06:29.723
I'll probably die of boredom first.

06:31.474 --> 06:34.811
Perfect weather for a picnic today.

06:35.020 --> 06:36.396
Thank you.

06:37.647 --> 06:41.234
I'm sure the funeral
will be over by evening.

06:41.359 --> 06:42.152
Okay.

06:48.199 --> 06:49.409
It's Zebedee.

06:50.160 --> 06:51.828
I'm going to the garden.

06:51.995 --> 06:54.289
Don't get in the way of his work.

06:54.664 --> 06:56.166
I know.

06:57.000 --> 06:58.835
Confucius, come along.

07:03.548 --> 07:05.842
I guess you wouldn't.

07:06.551 --> 07:08.094
Off I go.

07:08.345 --> 07:09.596
Have fun.

07:10.680 --> 07:13.224
She sure is a spirited little miss.

07:13.892 --> 07:16.895
She leaps at everything she sees.

07:18.229 --> 07:21.024
That's what I love about her.

07:25.862 --> 07:27.364
Zebedee!

07:28.531 --> 07:31.201
Huh, where did he go?

07:33.203 --> 07:34.454
Zebedee.

07:36.748 --> 07:37.874
What is it?

07:38.375 --> 07:42.045
You startled me.
I didn't notice you there at all.

07:42.379 --> 07:44.631
A gardener is part of the landscape.

07:48.551 --> 07:49.803
Wow.

07:50.720 --> 07:52.514
Let me help with that.

08:01.606 --> 08:03.024
Thank you!

08:06.945 --> 08:08.071
Be careful with them.

08:08.238 --> 08:09.030
I Will.

08:14.577 --> 08:18.331
Um, uh... I'm sorry.

08:19.916 --> 08:21.251
I should've known.

08:22.252 --> 08:25.672
Children and dogs aren't
cut out for gardening.

08:33.263 --> 08:34.431
A broomstick?

08:37.475 --> 08:39.102
All right!

08:43.148 --> 08:47.193
See, I knew I could do it.

08:48.945 --> 08:51.698
But this is a bit big...

08:52.449 --> 08:54.034
and hard to use...

09:17.474 --> 09:19.225
So you're a person.

09:21.978 --> 09:23.480
Thought you were a monkey.

09:23.646 --> 09:26.232
A little red-haired monkey
covered in leaves.

09:30.487 --> 09:33.740
Hey, that's no way to talk to a lady!

09:33.990 --> 09:35.867
Oh, I almost forgot.

09:36.493 --> 09:37.577
Hey!

09:37.702 --> 09:39.412
Hello, Miss Banks!

09:40.538 --> 09:42.999
Why Peter, good to see you.

09:43.541 --> 09:44.834
Peter...

09:45.001 --> 09:46.961
Mother asked me to deliver these.

09:48.338 --> 09:49.506
Ah, thank you.

09:49.672 --> 09:52.008
No vacation for you?

09:52.217 --> 09:53.760
No, I've got work.

09:54.052 --> 09:55.512
Is your mother well?

09:55.678 --> 09:58.973
Yes, she'll come to the mayor's
funeral after work.

09:59.349 --> 10:01.351
Then I'll see her later.

10:01.893 --> 10:05.188
Zebedee, will you bring
the car around?

10:13.905 --> 10:16.116
Right here, right here.

10:18.576 --> 10:20.036
Later!

10:52.735 --> 10:53.736
Want some'?

10:58.241 --> 11:00.410
Good'? I'm glad.

11:05.790 --> 11:10.670
It must be awful being a black cat,
everyone calling you bad luck.

11:11.254 --> 11:13.673
I can relate, though.

11:14.257 --> 11:16.342
I've got this frizzy red hair

11:16.593 --> 11:19.554
and no friends to eat lunch with.

11:21.973 --> 11:24.559
I end up failing at everything.

11:25.643 --> 11:29.439
I doubt anything good will
ever happen in my life...

11:36.613 --> 11:37.614
Hey!

11:38.615 --> 11:41.034
Wait, I'm not finished talking!

11:45.955 --> 11:47.457
It's grey now?

12:02.347 --> 12:03.806
Now it's black again?

12:17.654 --> 12:19.822
I've never been in the woods before.

12:21.824 --> 12:25.119
Wait, I'll get lost without you.

12:28.873 --> 12:32.710
Hey, I said wait for me.

12:50.853 --> 12:52.188
It's all dried up?

13:04.075 --> 13:08.496
There's two of you!
I see, you're a couple!

13:20.216 --> 13:21.634
What's wrong?

13:37.358 --> 13:38.735
How pretty.

13:43.573 --> 13:45.491
I'm only taking one.

13:50.913 --> 13:52.749
I wonder what it's called.

13:54.292 --> 13:56.002
I'll ask Zebedee later.

13:59.255 --> 14:00.590
Pretty, isn't it'?

14:01.799 --> 14:05.345
I found it in the woods.
The cats took me there.

14:05.928 --> 14:09.182
A black cat and a grey cat.
I wonder where they're from.

14:09.849 --> 14:13.019
The black one is Tib,
the grey one is Gib.

14:13.644 --> 14:16.356
They're both Peter's.

14:17.607 --> 14:19.108
Peter...

14:19.609 --> 14:21.110
Oh, that boy's?

14:21.611 --> 14:26.199
Not that cats ever belong to anyone.

14:26.949 --> 14:28.743
We only assume they do.

14:29.285 --> 14:33.289
But to think you found this
on your first trip to the woods...

14:34.165 --> 14:37.001
She's called “Fly-by-Night”.

14:37.335 --> 14:38.711
¢¢I§lY~by_N

14:39.629 --> 14:44.008
A rare flower, she is.
I've never seen a real one before.

14:44.675 --> 14:49.305
She only grows in these woods
and only blooms once in seven years.

14:49.847 --> 14:53.393
They say even witches once
sought after her.

14:53.684 --> 14:54.560
Vvfiches?

14:54.685 --> 14:56.813
That's right, the Witch's Flower.

14:56.979 --> 14:58.398
The Witch's Flower...

15:44.026 --> 15:45.278
What could that be?

15:54.412 --> 15:55.538
Tib!

15:56.247 --> 15:57.540
What's the matter?

15:59.083 --> 16:00.376
Did something happen?

16:04.380 --> 16:06.215
Have a fight with Gib?

16:08.217 --> 16:09.218
<i>T“)?</i>

16:12.597 --> 16:15.683
There, there.
There's nothing to fear.

16:18.060 --> 16:21.314
We'll go look for Gib tomorrow.

16:39.749 --> 16:40.917
<i>T“)?</i>

16:43.753 --> 16:45.087
Where is he?

16:45.755 --> 16:48.174
Maybe he went after Gib by himself.

16:48.966 --> 16:50.092
Mary.

16:52.136 --> 16:53.095
Good morning.

16:53.262 --> 16:59.018
Morning. I have a little favor
to ask, if you don't mind.

16:59.602 --> 17:02.522
A favor? Yes, of course!

17:04.315 --> 17:06.108
Would you deliver this?

17:07.443 --> 17:08.486
Sure.

17:08.986 --> 17:11.989
I wrote down the name and address.

17:13.491 --> 17:15.326
Okay, I'm leaving now!

17:15.617 --> 17:20.705
Oh, and there's an awful mist today,
so don't go into the woods!

17:20.830 --> 17:22.290
I know!

17:23.501 --> 17:24.877
Take care.

17:31.801 --> 17:34.804
“51 Village of Redmanor.
To Peter.”

17:36.472 --> 17:37.890
Peter?

17:40.810 --> 17:43.312
Of all people, it had to be him.

17:50.695 --> 17:53.281
Hey there, red-haired monkey.

17:54.532 --> 17:58.327
My name happens to be Mary Smith.

17:59.537 --> 18:01.831
So, you're called Mary.

18:04.000 --> 18:05.585
Huh'? What's this'?

18:05.835 --> 18:08.087
It's from Great-Aunt Charlotte.

18:10.715 --> 18:12.341
Raspberry jam!

18:12.508 --> 18:15.678
I love the raspberries from Redmanor!

18:15.845 --> 18:17.013
Brilliant!

18:18.806 --> 18:20.766
I better go thank her.

18:22.518 --> 18:23.352
Ahem.

18:23.894 --> 18:26.522
See you, I have to go look for Tib.

18:26.689 --> 18:27.690
<i>T“)?</i>

18:30.359 --> 18:33.779
Oh, so Tib went to your place?

18:34.196 --> 18:35.615
He disappeared, though.

18:36.365 --> 18:39.619
Is Gib there, too?
She's been missing since last night.

18:40.411 --> 18:41.454
Gib, too?

18:42.204 --> 18:45.041
Maybe they went back to
that place in the woods...

18:49.211 --> 18:50.796
Stay away from the woods.

18:51.297 --> 18:53.966
With all this mist, it's dangerous.

18:54.759 --> 18:56.218
Don't follow me.

18:56.385 --> 18:59.722
I'm looking for Gib, too.
And of course Tib...

19:02.141 --> 19:05.227
Don't do it! We can't go
into the woods on misty days!

19:06.896 --> 19:09.231
Oh, so you're afraid?

19:09.440 --> 19:10.566
Coward.

19:13.110 --> 19:15.988
Hey, I said wait!
Red-haired monkey!

19:18.449 --> 19:19.492
Be quiet!

19:20.076 --> 19:23.120
I didn't choose to have
frizzy red hair!

19:23.412 --> 19:24.413
I wish...

19:24.914 --> 19:26.624
I could change!

19:29.585 --> 19:30.628
Mary...

19:32.088 --> 19:33.255
Leave me alone.

19:33.964 --> 19:35.424
But you shouldn't...

19:35.633 --> 19:37.593
Don't you dare follow me!

19:38.594 --> 19:40.930
Fine, I won't!

19:44.600 --> 19:48.521
I'll never, ever, ever, ever forgive him!

19:59.615 --> 20:01.450
Look at that mist.

20:03.452 --> 20:04.453
Tib!

20:06.163 --> 20:08.207
I knew you were here.

20:09.625 --> 20:11.836
Tib, that flower...

21:06.348 --> 21:08.309
Ow...

21:12.605 --> 21:14.982
This isn't where we were yesterday...

21:20.029 --> 21:21.071
Tib!

21:27.495 --> 21:30.414
What's the matter?
Why'd you bring me here?

21:35.544 --> 21:37.546
A broomstick?

21:38.214 --> 21:41.258
What's a broomstick doing here?

21:48.349 --> 21:50.768
It looks awfully old.

21:52.853 --> 21:56.273
There's something written on it,
but I can't read it.

21:57.566 --> 22:03.489
Look, Tib. It's the perfect size.
Now I can help Zebedee.

22:18.671 --> 22:20.965
Tib, what are you up to'?

22:31.100 --> 22:32.434
What's going on'?

22:38.732 --> 22:40.317
The flower juice...

22:45.281 --> 22:46.782
Wait, wait...

23:02.256 --> 23:04.633
Huh? What is...?

23:07.761 --> 23:08.971
I'm floating!

23:33.954 --> 23:36.665
No,no,no,no,no!

24:02.858 --> 24:06.028
What is... happening?

24:15.996 --> 24:17.373
We're going to crash!

24:55.744 --> 24:58.789
I'm sure this is just a dream...

25:16.223 --> 25:18.100
What a large building.

25:26.942 --> 25:28.902
Stop! Stop! Stop!

25:38.412 --> 25:39.830
Ow...

25:40.289 --> 25:42.166
What just happened?

25:47.254 --> 25:49.298
Why so many broomsticks?

25:49.715 --> 25:53.343
Well well, you've made quite a mess.

25:54.928 --> 25:57.389
I'll have to clean it up later.

25:58.140 --> 26:01.518
But it looks like you'll be
needing a few lessons.

26:01.935 --> 26:05.439
Poor broom deserves a better dismount.

26:05.773 --> 26:09.276
There, there, there...

26:09.401 --> 26:10.694
That's a good boy.

26:10.819 --> 26:13.697
Hey, that tickles.

26:14.448 --> 26:16.533
Here's your spot.

26:16.658 --> 26:19.036
Get yourself some good rest.

26:20.996 --> 26:22.873
Good boy.

26:23.123 --> 26:26.460
Have you no love for your broom?

26:26.668 --> 26:31.840
And brooms always go here!
That's a very strict rule.

26:31.965 --> 26:35.552
I don't understand.
Where exactly am I?

26:35.677 --> 26:38.180
Me? Flanagan's the name.

26:38.305 --> 26:43.227
I used to teach broom riding,
and now I'm the stable master.

26:43.352 --> 26:45.729
No, what I meant to ask was...

26:45.854 --> 26:49.691
I know, I know.
You must be a new pupil, eh'?

26:49.817 --> 26:52.194
New pupil?
What do you mean?

26:55.531 --> 27:00.702
“What do you mean,” you ask,
with that fine cat as your familiar!

27:01.328 --> 27:02.579
A familiar?

27:02.704 --> 27:05.249
No, his name is Tib, and...

27:07.042 --> 27:09.711
Ho! That's the first bell! Hurry!

27:09.878 --> 27:13.090
They're strict about tardiness!

27:13.215 --> 27:15.217
Hey, wait for me!

27:24.518 --> 27:25.894
What a terrible dream.

27:26.061 --> 27:28.939
And he called Tib a familiar!

27:29.398 --> 27:31.275
Not a familiar?

27:31.400 --> 27:35.404
Black as he is,
and with eyes like emeralds?

27:35.696 --> 27:39.783
Next you'll be telling me
you're not a witch, won't you?

27:39.908 --> 27:40.909
A witch?

27:41.076 --> 27:45.664
Come now, hurry! You can't be late
for classes on your first day!

27:45.789 --> 27:49.376
Like I said, I'm not a new pupil...

27:52.880 --> 27:54.464
And here we are.

27:56.758 --> 27:58.135
I'm out of breath...

28:03.765 --> 28:04.683
Tib!

28:05.100 --> 28:09.479
Familiars must be leashed on campus.
That's the rule.

28:10.731 --> 28:11.815
Campus?

28:13.609 --> 28:16.111
Yes, of Endor College.

28:18.238 --> 28:20.115
Endor College...

28:21.074 --> 28:22.618
This is the main gate.

28:22.784 --> 28:27.664
Many a fine witch has
passed through this gate.

28:28.415 --> 28:32.794
It's a prestigious school
dating back to the days of dragons.

28:34.588 --> 28:37.841
Oh, yes.
I need to read you something.

28:39.259 --> 28:44.932
Endor College Rule Number One.
Remember this, or you will pay dearly.

28:45.098 --> 28:46.642
Pay dearly?

28:46.975 --> 28:49.436
Ready? Ahem!

28:49.811 --> 28:54.441
“Trespassers will be transformed.”
Now, repeat.

28:54.650 --> 28:57.694
“Trespassers will be transformed.”

28:58.445 --> 29:01.365
Those who enter wrongfully

29:01.490 --> 29:05.702
will be transformed into
some other form.

29:13.835 --> 29:17.047
New pupils get a tour from
the Headmistress herself.

29:17.172 --> 29:18.465
Wait!

29:18.799 --> 29:21.468
So long, until later!

29:25.973 --> 29:27.474
He abandoned me.

29:36.775 --> 29:38.527
Am I supposed to enter?

30:06.221 --> 30:07.597
How strange...

30:18.525 --> 30:22.070
This must be a mistake.
They'll let us out.

30:33.206 --> 30:36.293
It's okay, I'm not scared...

30:59.232 --> 31:04.112
Welcome to Endor College!
You must be a new pupil.

31:04.446 --> 31:07.115
No, actually, I...

31:11.870 --> 31:15.165
Look at this black cat familiar,
and this hair!

31:15.290 --> 31:17.167
No, I'm...

31:17.626 --> 31:20.379
You aren't, of course, a trespasser?

31:21.963 --> 31:24.174
I'm a new pupil, Madam.

31:25.634 --> 31:28.178
Excellent, excellent!

31:56.790 --> 32:00.794
I am the Headmistress,
Madam Mumblechook. Your name?

32:00.961 --> 32:03.547
What? Oh, Mary Smith, Madam.

32:03.672 --> 32:06.716
Welcome to Endor College, Mary Smith.

32:13.974 --> 32:17.686
This is the single finest
college of magic,

32:17.811 --> 32:20.439
open only to the chosen ones.

32:21.148 --> 32:22.899
College of magic...

32:24.359 --> 32:28.405
Come, now. Let me
show you around the campus.

32:39.040 --> 32:44.713
Sunlight is collected to
illuminate the campus day and night.

32:45.881 --> 32:47.883
It's beautiful.

32:49.050 --> 32:50.760
You like what you see'?

32:54.014 --> 32:55.098
It's Madam Mumblechook.

32:55.223 --> 32:56.766
Look, Tib!

32:56.892 --> 32:58.226
Hello, Madam.

32:58.351 --> 32:59.936
Good day to you.

33:01.354 --> 33:03.398
You have elevators, too.

33:03.565 --> 33:05.484
They run on electricity.

33:05.734 --> 33:08.737
Electricity is a form of magic, you know.

33:12.699 --> 33:15.118
What? What's happening?

33:18.872 --> 33:22.584
Let's tour the classrooms first.

33:35.430 --> 33:37.599
This is the First Year classroom.

33:39.100 --> 33:42.103
They're taking broom-riding lessons.

33:42.562 --> 33:47.651
It takes over a year to gain
true mastery over a broom.

33:47.776 --> 33:49.486
I see.

33:50.111 --> 33:52.489
But you won't be needing it.

33:53.615 --> 33:56.785
I noticed you were quite adept
with the broom.

33:58.787 --> 34:02.165
You need to see our
more specialized fields.

34:02.290 --> 34:03.416
Specialized?

34:03.625 --> 34:07.504
Magic aeronautics,
magic history, magic chemistry...

34:07.629 --> 34:10.422
We offer various majors in magic.

34:10.757 --> 34:13.510
But we are perhaps best known

34:13.635 --> 34:18.431
for transformation magic,
considered the most difficult.

34:18.806 --> 34:20.141
Transformation?

34:21.101 --> 34:22.435
Wow.

34:24.437 --> 34:27.565
But it's an awful lot of studying.

34:28.108 --> 34:30.819
Don't you have sports
or field trips?

34:30.944 --> 34:34.364
We have our recreations, of course.

34:35.657 --> 34:42.163
Indeed, this is a place for cultivating
excellence in both body and spirit.

34:43.164 --> 34:46.501
We have ample facilities
for physical training.

34:48.962 --> 34:50.338
This is amazing.

34:51.505 --> 34:54.217
This is the dining hall.

34:54.467 --> 34:59.389
We allow our students to eat
whenever and as much as they please.

34:59.806 --> 35:02.684
They're using magic to cook!
Looks delicious!

35:04.352 --> 35:09.190
It seems you have a remarkable talent,
Miss Mary Smith.

35:09.316 --> 35:11.401
Truly phenomenal.

35:11.526 --> 35:13.528
A talent? For what?

35:13.862 --> 35:17.240
What else? For magic, of course!

35:17.532 --> 35:20.368
The insignia on your hand is proof.

35:21.328 --> 35:23.079
Oh, this...

35:23.204 --> 35:24.623
I can already see it.

35:24.748 --> 35:27.709
You're a once-in-a-century prodigy!

35:28.001 --> 35:29.919
Mastering the broom already,

35:30.045 --> 35:35.091
and taming such a perfect familiar
as a black cat with emerald eyes!

35:35.342 --> 35:38.887
I'm not used to getting
compliments like this.

35:39.012 --> 35:41.431
Oh no, it is indeed remarkable!

35:45.685 --> 35:48.605
This flaming red hair of yours!

35:49.773 --> 35:54.110
Red-haired witches have always
been the most superior.

35:54.361 --> 35:58.740
No other hair color is
more coveted by witches.

36:00.742 --> 36:03.578
Only prodigies possess this hair.

36:12.253 --> 36:14.506
This is our laboratory.

36:14.881 --> 36:18.593
In Second Year, you'll also
conduct chemical experiments.

36:18.927 --> 36:20.970
Chemical experiments? Not magic?

36:21.096 --> 36:22.764
It's Doctor Dee's class.

36:22.889 --> 36:27.519
The renowned wizard,
the pride of our college!

36:27.769 --> 36:29.270
You haven't heard of him?

36:29.896 --> 36:32.982
Oh... of course!
The Doctor, right'?

36:35.902 --> 36:37.278
I'll introduce you to him.

36:37.445 --> 36:40.156
Doctor! Doctor Dee!

36:40.407 --> 36:42.325
Yes, Madam Mumblechook?

36:42.450 --> 36:46.663
I was just about to analyze
the results of the earlier tests.

36:47.247 --> 36:50.750
What warrants this interruption?

36:51.292 --> 36:55.755
Magic experiments must be analyzed
with precise calculations,

36:56.256 --> 37:00.176
on top of which we must
devise meticulous plans.

37:01.469 --> 37:04.973
Allow me to introduce you to
Mary Smith, a new pupil.

37:05.098 --> 37:09.811
A splendid talent with great potential.
And do look at her red hair!

37:10.437 --> 37:12.647
Red is indeed a marvelous color.

37:12.772 --> 37:15.817
Red is the most mature form
of a Philosopher's Stone...

37:16.109 --> 37:20.029
though I wonder if it was
first black, then white.

37:20.155 --> 37:23.158
In any case, nice to meet you, Miss Mary.

37:23.283 --> 37:25.493
Nice to meet you, too.

37:25.660 --> 37:30.331
Doctor Dee has long studied
the fusion of chemistry and magic.

37:30.832 --> 37:32.834
A question for the able one.

37:33.001 --> 37:37.380
If we call virtual reality worlds
from the lnterbaila language “turtle”

37:37.505 --> 37:42.886
and the approximate value of magic
in the ancient Eltel language “crane”,

37:43.011 --> 37:47.015
which of the two do you think
is the more effective approach

37:47.140 --> 37:50.560
in terms of the Alphalabozome
nucleic acid anti-Entatium reaction?

37:50.685 --> 37:53.229
- Uh...
- The turtle or crane?

37:54.189 --> 37:55.523
Turtle... I think...

37:55.648 --> 37:58.693
Turtle, you say'? Impossible!

38:01.362 --> 38:04.574
No, you may indeed be right!

38:04.824 --> 38:08.912
You've carved a new path!
Madam, this child is splendid!

38:09.037 --> 38:11.706
You're well versed in chemistry, too!

38:12.707 --> 38:15.043
Well, I'm not so bad at science.

38:15.376 --> 38:16.377
Very well!

38:16.503 --> 38:20.381
I shall show you
our most advanced class!

38:20.548 --> 38:21.883
Great!

38:30.892 --> 38:33.770
This is our most advanced class.

38:37.565 --> 38:38.775
But...

38:40.610 --> 38:42.445
There's no one here.

38:44.072 --> 38:46.449
I see the class is going well.

39:00.547 --> 39:01.965
Wow...

39:03.550 --> 39:06.302
They're practicing invisibility.

39:06.594 --> 39:08.304
Let's see you try it.

39:08.596 --> 39:09.931
You, Grizel!

39:10.223 --> 39:11.641
Let her borrow yours.

39:12.892 --> 39:15.228
But there's no way!

39:15.603 --> 39:17.105
I've never done this...

39:17.230 --> 39:17.897
Here!

39:23.611 --> 39:24.612
Sorry, Tib.

39:24.779 --> 39:27.699
Now look into the ball and concentrate.

39:31.452 --> 39:32.453
The flower insignias!

39:32.579 --> 39:38.334
Now dissolve your cells down
to the level of unconsciousness!

39:38.626 --> 39:42.881
Then use magical fusion
to cloak yourself!

39:47.927 --> 39:50.471
Fine, whatever happens will happen.

39:51.639 --> 39:56.561
Disappear, disappear, disappear,
disappear, disappear...

39:56.978 --> 40:00.732
Disappear, disappear, disappear,
disappear, disappear...

40:00.857 --> 40:04.360
Disappear, disappear, disappear,
disappear, disappear...

40:04.485 --> 40:05.695
She's doing it!

40:05.820 --> 40:07.322
Superb!

40:14.829 --> 40:16.706
What's happening? Wait...

40:24.505 --> 40:25.673
Could it be?

40:25.965 --> 40:31.179
She's already surpassed invisibility!

40:35.016 --> 40:36.851
What? What's happening?

40:40.521 --> 40:42.023
Tib!

40:44.359 --> 40:45.401
Tib!

41:00.208 --> 41:02.001
Excellent!

41:02.168 --> 41:05.171
Most sublime, Mary Smith!

41:05.880 --> 41:09.717
Where did you acquire such skill?
That was a very advanced spell.

41:09.842 --> 41:11.719
How unexpected!

41:11.844 --> 41:15.932
You may be a prodigy the likes
of which we've never seen!

41:16.057 --> 41:17.892
What? Oh, no no...

41:18.184 --> 41:21.104
That is the power of
a red-haired witch!

41:21.312 --> 41:23.564
- No wonder.
- A red-haired witch!

41:23.690 --> 41:25.608
She's amazing!

41:26.901 --> 41:31.656
I suppose that was only about
4O percent of my power.

41:33.241 --> 41:35.076
Unbelievable!

41:35.201 --> 41:38.579
We're hoping to reach
even loftier heights here.

41:38.705 --> 41:44.002
And we're truly honored to welcome
a gifted witch such as yourself!

41:44.877 --> 41:47.463
I'm looking forward to it.

41:47.922 --> 41:53.886
A round of applause for the enrollment
of this rare prodigy, Mary Smith!

41:57.932 --> 42:01.436
Don't worry!
I think I'd make a fine witch!

42:06.858 --> 42:09.068
My heart's still racing.

42:09.527 --> 42:13.406
Come to my office so I can
give you an enrollment form.

42:13.531 --> 42:15.074
Yes, with pleasure.

42:24.292 --> 42:28.755
Well now, I must tend to my
experiments in transformation magic.

42:30.715 --> 42:32.300
Transformation magic?

42:34.385 --> 42:35.970
That's the strongroom.

42:36.137 --> 42:41.267
It's where we keep the subjects
of our transformation experiments.

42:41.392 --> 42:42.101
Oh...

42:48.483 --> 42:51.819
A young specimen. This one
will make a great teaching aid.

42:54.655 --> 42:58.618
These are wonderful experiments

42:58.743 --> 43:01.913
that turn powerless animals
into magical beings.

43:02.038 --> 43:04.290
Transformation experiments?

43:13.758 --> 43:15.176
Tib!

43:24.268 --> 43:25.728
What's the matter, Tib?

43:27.188 --> 43:29.190
Hold on to your familiar.

43:29.357 --> 43:30.650
I'm sorry.

43:37.448 --> 43:39.325
What was that?

43:39.617 --> 43:43.538
The progress of science and magic
is built on countless failures.

43:43.704 --> 43:44.789
Failures?

43:44.914 --> 43:48.334
Precisely! Failures are valuable!

43:48.459 --> 43:51.003
Well, farewell for now, Miss Smith!

43:52.797 --> 43:54.882
I shall see you again after

43:55.049 --> 43:58.386
the sun sets and the moon rises
and the moon sets and the sun rises.

44:06.144 --> 44:08.187
Now let's get going, Miss Mary.

44:09.313 --> 44:11.524
Before it gets dark.

44:12.233 --> 44:13.234
Yes, Madam.

44:20.741 --> 44:25.705
Enrollment form, enrollment form...

44:25.997 --> 44:29.208
I'm sorry, go ahead and
wait for me upstairs.

44:29.333 --> 44:30.751
Oh, sure.

44:34.922 --> 44:37.133
You sure did surprise me.

44:38.593 --> 44:42.388
You truly are a remarkable talent.

44:43.097 --> 44:48.269
Upstairs you'll find magical items
dating back to ancient times.

44:48.603 --> 44:52.440
Hopefully we'll have a talent
like you using them soon.

44:55.484 --> 44:56.903
Amazing.

45:02.033 --> 45:03.701
That's odd.

45:04.452 --> 45:07.705
The enrollment form for
honor students should be here.

45:15.296 --> 45:16.589
It's that flower!

45:40.404 --> 45:41.822
<i>Master Spells.</i>

45:44.158 --> 45:47.328
<i>Spell to eliminate darkness.
Spell to make something rotten.</i>

45:48.079 --> 45:51.999
<i>Spell to ease stomach pains.
Spell to deflect an enemy's attack.</i>

45:52.667 --> 45:54.335
A book of magic spells.

45:55.503 --> 45:57.296
Starting tomorrow,

45:57.505 --> 46:01.008
we should have you serve as
our student representative.

46:01.592 --> 46:02.510
Huh'?

46:03.427 --> 46:04.178
Why is...

46:04.345 --> 46:06.138
You're more than qualified.

46:06.264 --> 46:10.017
You're the perfect person
to represent us.

46:10.268 --> 46:15.147
And perhaps I can ask you to
head up the Festival Committee.

46:15.273 --> 46:16.857
Urn...

46:17.066 --> 46:19.527
And also lead the study tours.

46:19.944 --> 46:23.906
I'm sure you'll soon represent us
at the academic conferences, too.

46:24.615 --> 46:28.661
After all, you've already mastered
such advanced magic...

46:28.786 --> 46:31.872
Wait, Madam... That's not true.

46:32.123 --> 46:33.207
Not true?

46:33.374 --> 46:36.711
You see, it's not that
I'm talented or anything.

46:37.211 --> 46:40.506
Being able to fly on the broom,
or becoming invisible...

46:40.631 --> 46:44.176
It's all thanks to a mysterious flower.

46:48.639 --> 46:49.932
Flower?

46:53.394 --> 46:54.937
A flower, you said?

46:55.479 --> 46:56.856
Well, um...

46:56.981 --> 46:59.066
A mysterious flower, you said?

46:59.191 --> 47:00.526
Uh...

47:00.651 --> 47:02.194
Do you have it with you now?

47:02.486 --> 47:05.197
You're hiding something
behind your back.

47:05.573 --> 47:06.907
No...

47:08.826 --> 47:10.369
What is it?

47:10.494 --> 47:12.371
It's nothing.

47:14.332 --> 47:15.583
Show it to me!

47:20.004 --> 47:22.381
What might this be?

47:26.761 --> 47:29.096
I don't recognize this language.

47:31.515 --> 47:35.728
<i>“51 Village of Redmanor. To Peter.”</i>

47:36.854 --> 47:39.273
The flower belongs to him.

47:39.857 --> 47:42.735
I don't really understand it myself.

47:43.027 --> 47:43.903
I see.

47:45.363 --> 47:48.449
That boy has great talents.
Far more than I do...

47:48.616 --> 47:51.160
May I hold onto this?

47:51.869 --> 47:53.412
Oh... Sure.

47:53.704 --> 47:57.291
I'll give you the enrollment form now.

47:57.875 --> 48:01.587
Fill it out and bring it tomorrow.

48:01.712 --> 48:03.130
Yes, Madam.

48:08.135 --> 48:12.807
You don't need to see me off.
I'll just be on my way.

48:13.724 --> 48:15.309
Thank you for today.

48:16.060 --> 48:19.772
Next time let's debate the
discontinuity of Filio functions, Mary.

48:19.897 --> 48:21.273
There he is.

48:25.569 --> 48:26.946
My broomstick!

48:30.074 --> 48:32.952
Look, your master's come back.

48:37.164 --> 48:39.500
But I don't know the way home.

48:39.667 --> 48:42.294
Don't worry, the broom knows.

48:42.670 --> 48:43.671
That's a relief!

48:47.925 --> 48:51.345
Let's try again.
Maybe gentler this time.

48:52.012 --> 48:53.347
Tib, let's go home.

48:54.598 --> 48:55.641
Tib!

48:57.101 --> 48:58.185
What's the matter?

48:58.436 --> 49:01.439
Maybe there's something
keeping him here.

49:01.689 --> 49:05.818
Cats have an affinity
for magic, after all.

49:10.781 --> 49:15.703
Tib, let's go, please.
I want to get home.

49:26.130 --> 49:28.549
Good, now hold on tight.

49:28.716 --> 49:29.425
Right.

49:34.305 --> 49:35.890
That broomstick...

49:37.808 --> 49:40.186
Remember, love your broom.

49:41.812 --> 49:43.105
To home!

49:46.650 --> 49:49.570
I said gentler this time!

49:53.157 --> 49:56.035
What a splendid witch
we have joining us.

49:56.160 --> 49:58.704
She brings great promise.

49:59.163 --> 50:01.582
She knows where the flowers are.

50:01.749 --> 50:03.584
Yes, indeed.

50:04.084 --> 50:07.546
Wait, what? The stolen flowers?

50:07.671 --> 50:08.589
Yes.

50:08.756 --> 50:12.426
And you let her leave?
With those flowers, we...

50:12.593 --> 50:14.053
No need to worry.

50:15.262 --> 50:17.598
She left us something useful.

50:24.438 --> 50:27.608
She might as well be
a leashed cat now.

50:36.283 --> 50:39.286
What should I do?
I stole the book.

50:41.038 --> 50:42.248
Tib, are you okay?

50:44.458 --> 50:46.794
What are you upset about?
The book?

50:47.044 --> 50:48.629
I couldn't help it.

50:49.046 --> 50:51.131
I was really scared, you know.

50:51.715 --> 50:55.469
I thought I was going
to be eaten alive.

50:55.678 --> 50:57.972
Anyone would've...

51:33.257 --> 51:34.633
Little broomstick?

51:37.678 --> 51:39.680
I guess the magic faded.

51:40.431 --> 51:43.309
But I'm not dreaming anymore, am I?

51:47.521 --> 51:48.689
Tib!

51:50.858 --> 51:52.192
He's gone.

51:53.027 --> 51:54.695
Such a moody cat.

52:07.791 --> 52:08.542
Ow...

52:12.796 --> 52:14.006
Ow...

52:14.798 --> 52:16.216
My bum...

52:18.218 --> 52:19.219
Mary?

52:22.306 --> 52:23.891
Thank goodness.

52:25.309 --> 52:26.810
Great-Aunt Charlotte!

52:34.401 --> 52:36.570
I knew it, I'm not dreaming anymore.

52:37.988 --> 52:40.574
Mary, we were worried, you know.

52:50.250 --> 52:53.420
Oh my, slow down a little, dear.

52:53.837 --> 52:56.090
But I'm really hungry.

52:56.340 --> 52:58.676
It must've been a wonderful day.

52:59.009 --> 53:00.928
Yes, yes it was...

53:01.095 --> 53:04.431
Yes, it was unbelievably exciting!

53:04.598 --> 53:08.352
But do try to come home
a little earlier.

53:08.686 --> 53:13.941
Let's go easy on her.
These things happen sometimes. Right?

53:14.358 --> 53:16.902
But home is still the best!

53:19.363 --> 53:20.572
Home, you said?

53:22.032 --> 53:24.118
This is yummy.

53:41.719 --> 53:45.764
“Fill out the form
and bring it tomorrow.”

53:46.640 --> 53:48.225
Not that I'll ever go back.

53:49.643 --> 53:53.313
“You truly are a remarkable talent.”

53:54.231 --> 53:56.942
“You may well be a prodigy,
Mary Smith.”

53:57.234 --> 54:00.654
“We should have you serve as
our student representative.”

54:07.244 --> 54:09.997
Yes, coming.

54:11.582 --> 54:14.209
Why, Zebedee. What is it'?

54:14.418 --> 54:16.503
Do you know where Peter is?

54:16.670 --> 54:17.963
Peter?

54:18.422 --> 54:20.507
What's happened to Peter?

54:21.175 --> 54:23.844
It seems... he's gone missing.

54:24.011 --> 54:24.970
He's gone missing?

54:25.095 --> 54:28.140
His bicycle was found at
the edge of the woods.

54:28.265 --> 54:31.685
My! In that mist?
Into the woods?

54:32.019 --> 54:33.854
Oh my goodness...

54:34.021 --> 54:37.524
Don't worry, I'm sure he'll
come home in no time.

54:37.858 --> 54:40.611
We'll go look for him.

54:41.111 --> 54:42.696
Do take care.

54:42.863 --> 54:44.823
Give our regards to his mother.

54:44.948 --> 54:46.200
I will. Good night.

54:56.126 --> 54:58.545
He must've gone into the woods.

55:06.470 --> 55:07.471
Tib!

55:25.572 --> 55:26.740
What is this?

55:29.827 --> 55:32.663
Mary Smith, the impostor witch.

55:33.080 --> 55:38.293
How dare you taint
our noble establishment!

55:38.836 --> 55:42.798
You haven't a single drop
of witch blood in you.

55:43.090 --> 55:46.927
Seems the mist has brought
this boy to us.

55:49.012 --> 55:49.763
Peter!

55:49.930 --> 55:54.935
It was easy to find him...
all thanks to your help.

55:55.435 --> 55:57.563
Want to save him?

55:57.938 --> 56:00.566
Then bring me the Witch's Flower!

56:00.774 --> 56:05.571
Bring me the flower,
and I shall let the boy go.

56:06.029 --> 56:09.700
But if you don't...
Remember the rule'?

56:10.033 --> 56:13.787
“Trespassers will be transformed.”

56:15.998 --> 56:19.251
So long, be well!

56:36.059 --> 56:37.811
It's my fault.

57:14.264 --> 57:16.475
I know, we have to go.

57:48.131 --> 57:49.049
Wait!

58:04.398 --> 58:05.482
Mary?

58:08.235 --> 58:13.031
Ow. I need you to fly quietly.
Or we'll be found.

58:18.912 --> 58:19.913
Tib!

58:25.919 --> 58:27.421
To Endor College.

58:38.348 --> 58:41.018
Mary, are you here?

59:00.203 --> 59:01.455
This is...

59:17.387 --> 59:18.346
Mary...

59:44.664 --> 59:45.665
Thanks.

59:48.085 --> 59:49.461
Wait for me here.

01:00:05.602 --> 01:00:07.145
Let's go, Tib.

01:00:09.773 --> 01:00:12.192
Hey, wait for me.

01:00:20.700 --> 01:00:25.372
Welcome back to Endor College,
Mary Smith.

01:00:29.126 --> 01:00:33.421
I didn't think we would
see you again so soon.

01:00:33.630 --> 01:00:38.426
Indeed, your return was faster than
Gelmen's magical reaction.

01:00:42.973 --> 01:00:44.724
Let Peter go.

01:00:44.975 --> 01:00:46.184
You brought it!

01:00:46.393 --> 01:00:50.897
That flower is too dangerous
for you to keep. Hand it over.

01:00:52.566 --> 01:00:55.402
Where's Peter? Let him go!

01:01:02.659 --> 01:01:04.077
Give it back!

01:01:10.417 --> 01:01:11.877
Well done.

01:01:23.597 --> 01:01:25.724
How beautiful!

01:01:25.849 --> 01:01:29.436
Hey, let me go! Stop it!

01:01:31.271 --> 01:01:33.106
Take her to the strongroom.

01:01:33.773 --> 01:01:36.735
She's a valuable specimen,
so handle her with care.

01:01:37.861 --> 01:01:42.574
This isn't what we agreed to!
Liars! Cowards!

01:01:54.544 --> 01:01:56.296
Ow...

01:02:13.146 --> 01:02:15.607
What do we do, Tib?

01:02:19.653 --> 01:02:20.820
<i>T“)?</i>

01:02:30.747 --> 01:02:31.665
What?

01:02:53.353 --> 01:02:55.480
What... are these...?

01:02:58.024 --> 01:03:01.861
Are you the
transformation experiments?

01:03:06.783 --> 01:03:11.329
You must be the “failures”
that Doctor Dee mentioned.

01:03:11.538 --> 01:03:12.664
How awful.

01:03:14.541 --> 01:03:15.375
Tib!

01:03:19.379 --> 01:03:21.381
Tib, but that's...

01:03:26.803 --> 01:03:28.888
<i>G“)... 'vs that you'?</i>

01:03:30.890 --> 01:03:34.561
I see, Tib. You wanted me
to rescue your girlfriend.

01:03:42.152 --> 01:03:45.363
I'm sorry, Gib.
I don't know what to do...

01:03:50.577 --> 01:03:52.871
You, witch! Get me out of here!

01:03:54.414 --> 01:03:55.540
Peter!

01:03:56.666 --> 01:04:00.420
Mary? What are you doing here?

01:04:03.840 --> 01:04:04.758
Mary?

01:04:06.009 --> 01:04:08.219
Are you okay?

01:04:09.429 --> 01:04:11.890
I'm sorry, Peter.

01:04:18.688 --> 01:04:20.607
This is it! Without a doubt.

01:04:20.815 --> 01:04:25.945
We can now resume the final phase
of our experiment...

01:04:26.112 --> 01:04:28.406
now that we have this flower!

01:04:28.698 --> 01:04:32.243
Tadpoles become frogs,
cocoons become butterflies.

01:04:32.452 --> 01:04:35.080
At last, we can give our students

01:04:35.205 --> 01:04:39.918
the enormous power to wield
any magic whatsoever!

01:04:40.377 --> 01:04:42.629
With that power
we can change the world!

01:04:42.796 --> 01:04:44.923
It's been a long time coming.

01:04:45.548 --> 01:04:47.801
We must succeed this time,

01:04:47.967 --> 01:04:50.595
lest we repeat that tragedy.

01:04:50.804 --> 01:04:56.059
With a younger subject now,
we can't go wrong.

01:04:56.643 --> 01:05:00.563
The more innocent the child,
the easier to transform.

01:05:00.814 --> 01:05:02.941
Yes, yes, yes. yes-

01:05:03.316 --> 01:05:08.154
Precisely. They absorb the
magic more directly.

01:05:08.571 --> 01:05:11.324
I'll begin preparations at once!

01:05:16.663 --> 01:05:17.622
I'm sorry...

01:05:18.164 --> 01:05:19.332
Don't worry.

01:05:20.667 --> 01:05:25.004
I wish they would've transformed
me instead, into an adult.

01:05:26.089 --> 01:05:29.300
Then I'd be able to help Mother.

01:05:29.759 --> 01:05:32.345
Especially if I could use magic.

01:05:33.555 --> 01:05:36.641
You're not the only one
who wants to change.

01:05:37.767 --> 01:05:38.726
Peter...

01:05:42.021 --> 01:05:45.733
There's got to be a way out of here!

01:05:50.071 --> 01:05:53.491
I need to get home no matter what!

01:05:55.201 --> 01:05:56.494
Let's go home...

01:05:57.412 --> 01:05:58.538
together!

01:06:02.792 --> 01:06:03.877
Peter!

01:06:04.711 --> 01:06:06.171
Ouch...

01:06:06.379 --> 01:06:07.380
Are you okay?

01:06:10.425 --> 01:06:11.384
Let's go home together.

01:06:12.051 --> 01:06:14.512
Tib and Gib, too.
All of us together.

01:06:17.557 --> 01:06:18.558
Good.

01:06:21.311 --> 01:06:23.229
Say, how did you get here?

01:06:23.396 --> 01:06:26.649
Me? I rode a broomstick.

01:06:27.233 --> 01:06:30.778
A broomstick?
Mary, you can use magic?

01:06:31.571 --> 01:06:34.574
Yes, well, only for one night.

01:06:39.412 --> 01:06:41.498
That's right, I'm...

01:06:42.332 --> 01:06:44.250
actually a witch tonight.

01:06:51.216 --> 01:06:55.595
Hurry, we need to rush
those kids to the lab!

01:06:57.764 --> 01:07:01.601
You never know
what kids are up to.

01:07:02.769 --> 01:07:07.273
“Spell to unfasten locks.”
No, not that.

01:07:07.524 --> 01:07:08.608
You can read this?

01:07:08.942 --> 01:07:10.735
“Spell to destroy doors.”

01:07:10.860 --> 01:07:12.820
No, we need to undo their spells.

01:07:13.696 --> 01:07:16.324
Spells? So you perform magic
by chanting spells?

01:07:16.533 --> 01:07:20.245
I don't think it's chanting
as much as using magical powers...

01:07:20.370 --> 01:07:23.748
Magical powers?
Where do you find powers like that?

01:07:23.873 --> 01:07:25.250
Found it!

01:07:25.458 --> 01:07:27.752
“Spell to undo all magic.”

01:07:28.127 --> 01:07:30.463
This would open the door <i>and</i> undo...

01:07:30.588 --> 01:07:31.798
the transformations!

01:07:41.516 --> 01:07:42.433
Mary!

01:07:46.062 --> 01:07:47.063
What is going on?

01:08:03.913 --> 01:08:04.914
Gib!

01:08:15.508 --> 01:08:16.509
Mary!

01:08:17.426 --> 01:08:19.011
Tib! Gib!

01:08:20.263 --> 01:08:23.015
What is this?
What just happened?

01:08:23.933 --> 01:08:26.185
The spells on the animals were undone.

01:08:26.352 --> 01:08:29.522
The door should be open, too.
Let's go!

01:08:29.772 --> 01:08:31.524
Oh. okay!

01:08:40.033 --> 01:08:41.033
What's that?

01:08:57.800 --> 01:09:00.219
It's dangerous here.
Let's go another way.

01:09:04.474 --> 01:09:07.894
Impossible!
I put a spell on that door!

01:09:08.394 --> 01:09:12.564
It was an advanced magical lock!

01:09:24.160 --> 01:09:26.078
What could that be?

01:09:34.087 --> 01:09:36.714
How did this happen?

01:09:44.930 --> 01:09:49.477
It's gone!
She took the “Master Spells”!

01:09:57.276 --> 01:09:59.779
Look, the door is open!
Mary!

01:10:02.365 --> 01:10:03.950
I'm over here.

01:10:23.720 --> 01:10:24.595
Where are we?

01:10:24.721 --> 01:10:25.930
Peter!

01:10:31.144 --> 01:10:32.895
They're all leaving from there.

01:10:33.020 --> 01:10:34.147
Let's g0!

01:10:57.086 --> 01:10:58.296
There they are!

01:10:58.921 --> 01:11:00.506
What are they doing?

01:11:02.341 --> 01:11:05.344
Madam, those kids did all this?

01:11:05.762 --> 01:11:08.514
She used the “Master Spells”.

01:11:08.765 --> 01:11:11.184
This is a disaster!

01:11:23.112 --> 01:11:25.364
We have no choice but to jump.

01:11:26.616 --> 01:11:27.366
Let's g0!

01:11:27.533 --> 01:11:28.367
Wait!

01:11:28.618 --> 01:11:29.869
Newcomer!

01:11:34.123 --> 01:11:34.832
Little broomstick!

01:11:34.957 --> 01:11:38.085
You can't just leave
your broom anywhere!

01:11:38.795 --> 01:11:41.714
Park them where they belong, I said!

01:11:42.548 --> 01:11:43.716
Mister Flanagan!

01:11:44.801 --> 01:11:48.387
Kids these days don't
look after their brooms!

01:11:48.638 --> 01:11:52.016
Say, what's with all this
commotion today?

01:11:52.225 --> 01:11:53.434
Thank you very much!

01:11:57.980 --> 01:11:59.023
Flanagan!

01:11:59.148 --> 01:12:01.108
He'll never change.

01:12:04.320 --> 01:12:05.196
Hop on.

01:12:05.822 --> 01:12:07.198
Just do it!

01:12:07.323 --> 01:12:08.699
Oh, okay.

01:12:14.997 --> 01:12:16.040
We're floating!

01:12:16.582 --> 01:12:18.167
Hold on tight!

01:12:19.335 --> 01:12:21.045
Stop right there!

01:12:29.679 --> 01:12:30.763
Peter!

01:12:38.020 --> 01:12:39.897
Mary, you go without me.

01:12:41.107 --> 01:12:41.774
Go!

01:12:41.983 --> 01:12:44.443
Peter!

01:12:56.956 --> 01:12:58.124
That's a good face.

01:12:58.708 --> 01:13:02.128
A pure-eyed child is
the perfect subject.

01:13:02.295 --> 01:13:03.629
Indeed, he's a good boy.

01:13:08.885 --> 01:13:10.303
Stop it, you...

01:13:14.098 --> 01:13:17.184
I must go retrieve
the “Master Spells”.

01:13:18.060 --> 01:13:22.106
Who knows what she'll try
to do with that book!

01:13:26.736 --> 01:13:28.654
Go back! I said go back!

01:13:28.988 --> 01:13:31.657
Why won't you do as I say'?

01:13:46.088 --> 01:13:48.174
Where are you taking me?

01:13:51.093 --> 01:13:52.178
That island?

01:13:55.681 --> 01:13:56.807
Little broomstick?

01:14:10.863 --> 01:14:15.159
Ow...
Hey, what is going on?

01:14:17.036 --> 01:14:18.329
Little broomstick?

01:14:37.890 --> 01:14:39.392
Whose home is this?

01:14:45.064 --> 01:14:47.233
Welcome home, Miss!

01:14:47.483 --> 01:14:48.567
Miss?

01:15:07.086 --> 01:15:08.754
I see, it's your home.

01:15:10.006 --> 01:15:12.383
Oh, because I told you to go back...

01:15:14.343 --> 01:15:17.930
It's been a long time, Miss.
Pleasure to have you back.

01:15:18.597 --> 01:15:22.935
Truth be told, I didn't think
you would ever come back.

01:15:23.519 --> 01:15:25.938
Now please, come inside.

01:15:29.066 --> 01:15:30.568
Hello...

01:15:35.614 --> 01:15:37.950
I hope it's okay to come in.

01:15:54.383 --> 01:15:56.469
What a lovely room.

01:15:58.554 --> 01:15:59.638
Photos?

01:16:04.810 --> 01:16:06.312
Madam and Doctor Dee?

01:16:10.816 --> 01:16:11.650
Tib!

01:16:12.109 --> 01:16:14.820
Don't, this isn't our home.

01:16:16.489 --> 01:16:17.615
This is...

01:16:19.742 --> 01:16:22.119
what Gib was transformed into!

01:16:23.120 --> 01:16:24.997
These are lab notes.

01:16:28.167 --> 01:16:30.544
How dare they!

01:16:36.926 --> 01:16:39.678
What... is this...?

01:16:41.847 --> 01:16:42.848
<i>Mary...</i>

01:16:43.933 --> 01:16:46.185
I'm sorry, I was just...

01:16:50.606 --> 01:16:52.983
Oh, it's just a mirror.

01:17:00.366 --> 01:17:01.659
The mirror is...

01:17:08.040 --> 01:17:09.041
Mary!

01:17:09.708 --> 01:17:12.545
Great-Aunt Charlotte!
But why?

01:17:12.795 --> 01:17:14.880
That's my old home.

01:17:15.047 --> 01:17:17.883
The broomstick must've
taken you there.

01:17:18.050 --> 01:17:21.512
Your home? And the broomstick?
I don't understand.

01:17:21.637 --> 01:17:23.889
Do you have the “Fly-by-Night”?

01:17:24.056 --> 01:17:27.685
Uh, no.
Madam and Doctor Dee took it.

01:17:27.977 --> 01:17:30.938
I see... As I feared.

01:17:31.147 --> 01:17:32.690
What exactly is going on?

01:17:32.815 --> 01:17:34.400
Mary, listen.

01:17:34.984 --> 01:17:38.737
What they are trying to do
is very dangerous.

01:17:47.329 --> 01:17:48.747
Wow.

01:17:48.998 --> 01:17:51.292
It was a long time ago.

01:17:52.168 --> 01:17:55.713
I stole the flower seeds
from Madam and Doctor Dee.

01:17:55.838 --> 01:17:56.922
Stole them?

01:18:02.761 --> 01:18:06.265
Back then, everyone loved
Madam and Doctor Dee.

01:18:06.932 --> 01:18:10.769
They were kindhearted teachers
and gifted scientists.

01:18:13.522 --> 01:18:14.440
But...

01:18:14.773 --> 01:18:19.403
when I found that flower, I made
the mistake of giving it to them.

01:18:23.699 --> 01:18:26.452
After that, they were never the same.

01:18:31.624 --> 01:18:36.754
They grew obsessed with studying
the magical seeds of that flower.

01:18:37.546 --> 01:18:40.591
That flower has unimaginable power.

01:18:41.133 --> 01:18:44.929
Madam wanted to use that power

01:18:45.221 --> 01:18:48.599
to give the students
great magical ability.

01:18:54.813 --> 01:18:56.398
But the experiment failed.

01:18:57.149 --> 01:18:59.151
They couldn't control it.

01:19:01.070 --> 01:19:05.658
All I could do was take the
remaining seeds and escape.

01:19:07.618 --> 01:19:10.496
I couldn't let them
repeat that mistake.

01:19:12.081 --> 01:19:16.418
Some powers in this world
just can't be harnessed.

01:19:16.919 --> 01:19:17.670
And yet,

01:19:17.836 --> 01:19:22.675
those two still believe
they can make it work.

01:19:22.883 --> 01:19:26.804
So if they get their hands
on that flower again...

01:19:33.102 --> 01:19:35.521
...they'll try it on Peter!

01:19:37.606 --> 01:19:39.858
Mary, put your hand on the mirror.

01:19:41.694 --> 01:19:42.695
Like this?

01:19:43.195 --> 01:19:46.699
I'm not a witch anymore.
Maybe you can...

01:19:55.791 --> 01:19:57.042
A “Fly-by-Night”!

01:19:57.376 --> 01:19:59.211
That's the last one.

01:19:59.712 --> 01:20:02.715
Your magic is fading... almost gone.

01:20:02.965 --> 01:20:04.717
Use it to come home now.

01:20:05.467 --> 01:20:08.887
Or you won't be able to
return home ever again!

01:20:09.722 --> 01:20:11.056
Mary!

01:20:26.989 --> 01:20:30.576
No, I can't just go home by myself.

01:20:30.743 --> 01:20:33.912
I promised,
“We'll go home together.”

01:20:34.163 --> 01:20:36.915
I need to go to Peter.

01:20:37.333 --> 01:20:38.292
Peter!

01:20:38.834 --> 01:20:42.087
I need to use this flower's magic
to save him!

01:20:44.923 --> 01:20:45.591
Mary!

01:20:48.093 --> 01:20:49.219
Madam!

01:20:50.512 --> 01:20:53.474
Mary, I'm sorry.
There's nothing more I can do.

01:20:53.849 --> 01:20:56.477
But I believe in you.
I'll be waiting.

01:20:58.103 --> 01:21:01.106
Don't worry, I'm definitely
coming home to Redmanor.

01:21:01.940 --> 01:21:02.775
Mary!

01:21:06.445 --> 01:21:07.654
Mary...

01:21:12.785 --> 01:21:15.120
Of all places, she came here!

01:21:19.375 --> 01:21:21.210
Oh no you won't!

01:21:23.253 --> 01:21:24.171
Ready?

01:21:27.091 --> 01:21:28.467
Little broomstick!

01:21:31.762 --> 01:21:33.138
Are you okay?

01:21:45.651 --> 01:21:48.320
Give my book back, Mary Smith!

01:21:54.952 --> 01:21:58.664
Little broomstick, hang in there!
Take me to Peter!

01:22:01.166 --> 01:22:03.168
She still possesses such power!

01:22:04.461 --> 01:22:05.587
Get back here!

01:22:11.468 --> 01:22:13.220
That's where Peter must be.

01:22:13.637 --> 01:22:16.014
At last, it truly begins.

01:22:22.521 --> 01:22:24.231
Give me back my book!

01:22:31.989 --> 01:22:33.115
My bag!

01:22:37.035 --> 01:22:38.412
And the flower!

01:22:42.040 --> 01:22:42.916
Give it back!

01:22:43.667 --> 01:22:47.379
Don't be silly. Both the book and
the flower belong to me.

01:23:07.858 --> 01:23:10.736
You'll have to use up
your power to get away.

01:23:11.403 --> 01:23:15.073
But to think she had
another flower up her sleeve!

01:23:16.241 --> 01:23:18.076
Frightening child...

01:23:24.875 --> 01:23:27.461
Please, hang on just a little longer!

01:23:27.878 --> 01:23:29.630
Hey! Shoo, shoo!

01:23:32.382 --> 01:23:33.425
Little broomstick!

01:23:53.737 --> 01:23:55.614
Ow...

01:24:01.078 --> 01:24:02.788
The insignia's gone.

01:24:05.541 --> 01:24:06.625
Tib!

01:24:11.880 --> 01:24:13.298
Little broomstick!

01:24:14.967 --> 01:24:16.635
Oh, no...

01:24:17.511 --> 01:24:19.179
Please, say something!

01:24:20.347 --> 01:24:21.515
Little broomstick...

01:24:24.685 --> 01:24:27.354
What am I supposed to do?

01:24:31.108 --> 01:24:32.359
Little broomstick...

01:24:39.616 --> 01:24:40.867
Little broomstick!

01:24:52.337 --> 01:24:54.006
You're right.

01:24:55.799 --> 01:24:57.551
I made a promise.

01:25:04.349 --> 01:25:05.892
Let's go home together.

01:25:10.522 --> 01:25:13.525
To Redmanor, all of us.

01:26:12.751 --> 01:26:14.795
You're the one who escaped with us!

01:26:19.591 --> 01:26:20.967
Everyone!

01:27:07.305 --> 01:27:08.515
Can I make it up there?

01:27:09.641 --> 01:27:11.560
Thanks, I'll go from here.

01:27:14.771 --> 01:27:16.231
Little broomstick...

01:27:17.733 --> 01:27:21.528
It's thanks to you
I made it this far.

01:27:23.613 --> 01:27:25.699
I'll be right there, Peter!

01:27:40.338 --> 01:27:41.673
What do we do?

01:27:50.640 --> 01:27:51.892
Gib!

01:27:54.436 --> 01:27:56.730
So you're safe! Where's Peter?

01:28:01.359 --> 01:28:03.195
You want me to go inside?

01:28:29.346 --> 01:28:31.890
Put that in the Velta socket.

01:28:43.068 --> 01:28:44.611
The “Fly-by-Night”!

01:28:44.736 --> 01:28:46.071
At last!

01:28:46.738 --> 01:28:49.616
We commence the final stage!

01:28:51.493 --> 01:28:55.080
To think how much time
we invested in this...

01:28:55.372 --> 01:28:58.250
Now it all comes to fruition!

01:29:04.548 --> 01:29:05.549
Peter!

01:29:06.424 --> 01:29:10.637
Now this boy will have the power
to wield any magic.

01:29:10.804 --> 01:29:15.308
And soon we'll have a marvelous world
in which everyone can use magic!

01:29:15.433 --> 01:29:18.812
Indeed, the world will be changed!

01:29:19.437 --> 01:29:20.605
Stop it!

01:29:34.077 --> 01:29:35.996
How beautiful!

01:29:36.413 --> 01:29:37.497
Peter!

01:29:38.081 --> 01:29:41.084
Undo this! Please!

01:29:43.920 --> 01:29:45.088
Stop it!

01:29:51.303 --> 01:29:52.804
What's happening?

01:29:57.601 --> 01:29:58.852
Peter...

01:29:59.936 --> 01:30:01.605
Calm down, everyone!

01:30:02.105 --> 01:30:06.318
This is no failure!
This is all within our projected...

01:30:07.986 --> 01:30:09.487
What is...

01:30:10.989 --> 01:30:12.616
It's melting!

01:30:13.491 --> 01:30:16.494
This can't be happening!
Open the valve!

01:30:21.541 --> 01:30:22.542
No!

01:30:25.253 --> 01:30:26.713
Not yet! Not yet!

01:30:35.138 --> 01:30:39.684
My dreams! My hopes!
Doctor Dee, do something!

01:30:43.521 --> 01:30:44.564
Mary...

01:30:45.690 --> 01:30:46.608
Peter!

01:30:46.733 --> 01:30:51.029
It's only the second phase!
We can control it!

01:31:13.718 --> 01:31:15.595
This is just like last time.

01:31:18.223 --> 01:31:20.558
Then we must undo the spells!

01:31:20.725 --> 01:31:21.643
What?

01:31:25.689 --> 01:31:27.899
“To undo all magic...”

01:31:28.525 --> 01:31:29.818
The “Master Spells”!

01:31:29.943 --> 01:31:34.406
Don't! All our research
will be for nought!

01:31:35.907 --> 01:31:37.158
Where is it?

01:31:41.371 --> 01:31:42.455
Madam!

01:31:49.754 --> 01:31:50.630
Madam!

01:31:50.922 --> 01:31:52.716
How could this happen?

01:31:53.216 --> 01:31:55.301
Her magic's been drained.

01:31:57.721 --> 01:32:00.306
I did everything perfectly!

01:32:00.974 --> 01:32:02.851
How could this happen?

01:32:45.769 --> 01:32:47.020
There it is!

01:32:53.109 --> 01:32:54.486
Break!

01:33:03.995 --> 01:33:06.831
Peter, I'm going to rescue you!

01:33:20.345 --> 01:33:21.763
Ma... ry...

01:33:21.888 --> 01:33:23.348
Peter!

01:33:24.849 --> 01:33:26.601
Run... away...

01:33:26.726 --> 01:33:27.685
Peter!

01:33:27.811 --> 01:33:29.187
Get away!

01:33:29.896 --> 01:33:32.816
You can't defeat him without magic!

01:33:32.941 --> 01:33:36.402
He's a monster who can use any magic!

01:33:37.487 --> 01:33:39.531
Who can use any magic?

01:33:40.323 --> 01:33:41.407
I know!

01:33:45.328 --> 01:33:46.788
Peter, can you hear me?

01:33:47.831 --> 01:33:49.082
Give me your hand!

01:33:50.458 --> 01:33:53.586
You should be able to
use the book now!

01:33:55.505 --> 01:33:57.882
Let's go home, together!

01:34:09.602 --> 01:34:11.229
Undo“.

01:34:11.688 --> 01:34:12.939
All magic!

01:34:26.703 --> 01:34:27.662
Madam!

01:34:28.913 --> 01:34:31.124
We don't need magic!

01:35:32.268 --> 01:35:33.186
Mary!

01:35:34.103 --> 01:35:34.896
Peter!

01:35:35.438 --> 01:35:37.690
And Gib! You're safe!

01:35:38.900 --> 01:35:40.026
Tib!

01:35:41.611 --> 01:35:43.363
Look, here's your bag.

01:35:43.905 --> 01:35:47.784
But I haven't found
your broomstick and coat.

01:35:49.369 --> 01:35:51.829
Thank you, Peter.

01:35:52.789 --> 01:35:54.707
Now how do we get home?

01:35:54.958 --> 01:35:57.210
How many times must I tell you!

01:35:57.794 --> 01:36:01.464
You can't just leave
your broom anywhere!

01:36:01.589 --> 01:36:02.340
Mister Flanagan!

01:36:02.465 --> 01:36:03.758
It's you!

01:36:03.883 --> 01:36:06.177
Come on, your master's here.

01:36:08.137 --> 01:36:09.681
Little broomstick!

01:36:10.139 --> 01:36:11.349
What happened?

01:36:12.016 --> 01:36:13.518
You're fixed!

01:36:14.143 --> 01:36:18.690
Unbelievable. Show your broom
a little more respect!

01:36:19.315 --> 01:36:20.566
Thank you!

01:36:24.487 --> 01:36:25.863
Wow!

01:36:32.537 --> 01:36:34.038
I wonder...

01:36:34.998 --> 01:36:36.416
if they'll be okay.

01:36:37.417 --> 01:36:40.586
You mean Madam and Doctor Dee?
They'll be fine.

01:36:41.254 --> 01:36:44.799
They can use magic, after all.
They'll find a way.

01:36:49.178 --> 01:36:52.098
That's true, they're tough.

01:36:52.348 --> 01:36:54.475
Hey, there's something in your hair.

01:36:59.022 --> 01:37:00.690
A “Fly-by-Night”!

01:37:04.068 --> 01:37:06.946
But I don't need it anymore.

01:37:12.744 --> 01:37:14.454
What was that?

01:37:15.204 --> 01:37:18.791
Hold on tight.
It's my last time using magic!

01:37:19.709 --> 01:37:22.920
Hey, hey! Stop!
