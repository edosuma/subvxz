What do you think?

02:01.639 --> 02:03.402
This is yours?

02:03.508 --> 02:08.467
Well, only 15% of us actually
live in the neighborhoods we patrol.

02:08.579 --> 02:11.207
[Chuckles]

02:11.315 --> 02:14.148
Ah, taming the frontier
isn't enough for you?

02:14.252 --> 02:16.948
Well, /'m thinking
of staking a claim.

02:17.054 --> 02:19.454
Seemed like a good idea a month ago
when I put down the deposit.

02:19.557 --> 02:23.550
But, uh, now with
everything heating up-

02:23.661 --> 02:27.927
Antwon Mitchell-
maybe it's not such a good idea.

02:30.968 --> 02:34.995
Get extra patrols,

02:35.106 --> 02:38.940
/ can't divert police resources
for my own protection.

02:39.043 --> 02:41.603
That would defeat the purpose
of living in the hood.

02:41.712 --> 02:43.976
Why am / here?

02:44.081 --> 02:46.276
You want me to find
a couple of code violations...

02:46.384 --> 02:48.852
sweat your landlord
to get your deposit back?

02:48.953 --> 02:51.751
I didn't sell you out.

02:51.856 --> 02:53.756
[Scoffs]

02:53.858 --> 02:57.760
Everyone in L.A. saw you on that tape

02:57.862 --> 02:59.887
/ had to ask you
to take a step back.

02:59.997 --> 03:01.897
A backseat.

03:01.999 --> 03:07.096
Let me guess. Either you're with Vic Mackey
or you're against him, right?

03:07.205 --> 03:10.766
- Keeps things simple.
- I'm with you...

03:10.875 --> 03:12.775
but I expect you
to be with me.

03:12.877 --> 03:17.837
Wherever your head is these days,
just don't start cutting me out...

03:17.949 --> 03:21.510
or going around me,
like you did with Aceveda.

03:21.619 --> 03:23.519
Keeps things simple.

03:28.659 --> 03:30.593
Hey, man,
where the hell you been?

03:30.695 --> 03:33.493
- Taking care of some things.
- I hope you're talking about Shane.

03:33.598 --> 03:35.793
- We need to stick together.
- I don't need babysitters.

03:35.900 --> 03:38.869
Antwon's got Shane coming out to kill you, for
Christ's sakes. What the hell we doing about it?

03:38.970 --> 03:42.133
- I'm watching my back.
- Really? Out there in the open?
He could be setting you up.

03:42.240 --> 03:44.504
Could be a drive-by.
Could be waiting for you at your house.

03:44.609 --> 03:47.669
He and Army are off the grid.
You seen them at all today?

03:47.778 --> 03:49.712
We went by Shane's truck
to pick up the latest tape...

03:49.814 --> 03:51.975
- they're nowhere.
- Come on, let's get out there.
Come straight at him.

03:52.083 --> 03:54.984
Don't worry.
When the time's right.

04:01.158 --> 04:04.423
- Why did you change your hair?
- It was a whim.

04:04.529 --> 04:06.121
It's like seeing a stranger
in the mirror.

04:06.230 --> 04:08.721
That's a bit drastic.
/ wish you'd have asked me first.

04:08.833 --> 04:10.733
I could've offered
an opinion.

04:10.835 --> 04:12.735
You don't like it?

04:14.605 --> 04:16.572

Her asshole boss fired her today.

04:41.766 --> 04:43.666
I'm sure your sister
will be fine.

04:43.768 --> 04:45.702
She wants to come over.

04:45.803 --> 04:48.567
- You told her it's not a good time.
- Look, / wouldn't do this.

04:48.673 --> 04:51.107
It's just,
she's really on edge, depressed.

04:51.208 --> 04:53.301

Mitch Robville, 33, throat slashed.

05:33.684 --> 05:36.084
Was supposed to pick up a friend
for work this morning. Never showed.

05:36.187 --> 05:38.519
He should've used
a safety razor.

05:38.623 --> 05:41.217
- Did you say Mitch Robville?
- You know him?

05:41.325 --> 05:44.351
Yeah, he's one of our informants.
He tipped us about the crack house on Rivermore.

05:44.462 --> 05:47.795
Took the money and ran. Idiot shouldn't have
turned down our offer to move him.

05:49.900 --> 05:52.027
Tip leads to a seizure,
and this is what happens.

05:52.136 --> 05:54.400
We have to assume the same thing
happened to Angie.

05:54.505 --> 05:57.668
Yeah, that's one way
to make sure the snitch-well runs dry.

05:57.775 --> 06:02.178
Very first roll call, / said that
we would protect the people who helped us.

Wanted to make sure you were okay.

06:31.942 --> 06:32.977
You okay?

06:32.977 --> 06:34.239
You okay?

06:34.345 --> 06:37.007
One-niners got a campaign
against police informants?

06:37.114 --> 06:39.014
I'm done with this.

06:39.116 --> 06:42.051
You think you can just
go after anyone?

06:42.153 --> 06:44.087
You think
you're indestructible?

06:44.188 --> 06:46.088

what you're spittin'.

06:46.190 --> 06:48.818
[Crowbar Clatters]

06:50.695 --> 06:53.357
If you've given the word,

06:53.464 --> 06:56.558
or some citizen,
or some cop gets hurt...

06:56.667 --> 06:59.192
you're gonna be spittin' teeth.

07:01.505 --> 07:03.837
[Chuckles]
I'm going back to bed.

07:03.941 --> 07:07.604
Make sure you get
that door fixed.

07:07.712 --> 07:10.010

walk right in.

the same inter-ghetto memo.

Word's out
our dead guy was our tip.

07:28.299 --> 07:30.199

I tried to take every precaution...

07:30.301 --> 07:32.997
with our seizure C.I.'s
since Angie disappeared.

07:33.104 --> 07:36.403
[Sighs] Pull in the rest of the tipsters
until we get a handle on this.

07:36.507 --> 07:40.671
Pulling in C.I.'s is only gonna
expose them more or ratchet things up.

07:40.778 --> 07:44.578
They're all at risk. Could be
Antwon Mitchell sending out a hell of a signal.

07:44.682 --> 07:48.584
- Well, I'll see about sending him one back.
- I'm also calling in I.A.D.

07:48.686 --> 07:52.486
Seizures are stirring things up.
We could be gettin' ourselves all worked up...

07:52.590 --> 07:54.490
about a leak that
doesn't exist.

07:54.592 --> 07:56.219
Then let them prove that.

07:56.327 --> 08:00.696
Do you really want to give Aceveda
more ammunition to shut this thing down?

08:00.798 --> 08:02.959
Give me one last chance
to find the leak and plug it.

08:07.138 --> 08:11.006
Okay. But first,
solve this murder.

08:14.311 --> 08:16.711
[Door Opens]

08:18.516 --> 08:21.314
Somebody killed one of our rats.
I'm running it down.

08:21.418 --> 08:23.784
- Where do you want us?
- Captain's digging deeper into our leak.

08:23.888 --> 08:27.415
Get the info from Billings, compare it to Angie's,
see what they have in common.

08:27.525 --> 08:29.584
Why bother? Shane and Antwon
are responsible for Angie.

08:29.693 --> 08:31.558
We can't tell the captain,
can we?

08:31.662 --> 08:33.687
- [Curtis] What about Shane?
- [Mackey] This again?

08:33.798 --> 08:37.756
You just want us to sit on our asses?
Do you have a plan?

08:37.868 --> 08:40.894
You gonna tell us what it is?

08:41.005 --> 08:42.734
Shane's cell phone.

08:42.840 --> 08:45.172
I palmed it from
his locker yesterday.

08:45.276 --> 08:47.301
Keep an eye on it,
see who calls.

08:47.411 --> 08:49.038
That's it?
That's the master plan?

08:49.146 --> 08:52.343
- Part of it.
- What are we doing to end this?

08:53.984 --> 08:57.181
I appreciate you two
having my back...

08:57.288 --> 08:59.654
but I don't need it.

09:04.261 --> 09:06.252
Meet me on the other side
in three minutes.

09:06.363 --> 09:08.991
[Cell Phone Beeps]

09:10.734 --> 09:12.998
Your unfinished business
kicked down my door last night.

09:13.103 --> 09:15.003
You know, it's complicated.
He's a smart guy.

09:15.105 --> 09:18.006
- I got to do it right.
- Yeah. He's coming straight at me, man.

09:18.108 --> 09:21.703
I'm not gonna lose no more sleep
over this asshole, you feel me?

09:21.812 --> 09:25.543
Tomorrow morning's news will have
a big picture of Mackey's kids...

09:25.649 --> 09:28.311
crying their eyes out.

09:28.419 --> 09:31.252
Or a picture of your son,
crying his.

09:31.355 --> 09:34.085
You don't want to make that threat.

09:34.191 --> 09:39.493
Your wife still
sell real estate? Hmm?

09:39.597 --> 09:42.225
Still show
those open houses?

09:43.534 --> 09:45.764
Yeah.

09:45.870 --> 09:48.498
Playtime is over.

09:48.606 --> 09:50.506
Get it done tonight.

09:50.608 --> 09:52.508
[Grunts]

- [Cell Phone Beeps]
- I'm on my way.

10:00.684 --> 10:02.914
- [Chattering]
- Ken Gibbin, science teacher.

10:03.020 --> 10:04.920
Been at this high school
seven years.

10:05.022 --> 10:07.013
[Monica]
He's not one of our C./. 's.

10:07.124 --> 10:10.753
Maybe he dropped a dime on one ofhis students.
This ain't exactly finishing school.

10:10.861 --> 10:13.125
- [Billings] I ran his name. It's coming up dry.
- Keep checking.

10:13.230 --> 10:16.631
Grab the class rosters. Run the names with
the principal. See who's not on the dean's list.

10:16.734 --> 10:18.634
He may or may not
be connected.

10:18.736 --> 10:21.170
Sure the throat's cut,
but it could be a copycat.

10:21.272 --> 10:26.141
You have a different way to go? You have
a lead on the first murder I'm not aware of?

10:26.243 --> 10:29.110
- Are all the other snitches in safe houses yet?
- I just finished that.

10:29.213 --> 10:33.547
Call in the next shift O.T.
Increase their protection.

10:33.651 --> 10:36.950
- You don't think the one shift's got it covered?
- No. I don't.

10:40.391 --> 10:43.292
He's been doing 15 months
for possession.

10:43.394 --> 10:45.385
Only 14 months to go.

10:45.496 --> 10:48.556
Someone planted
all that weight in my locker.

10:48.666 --> 10:51.191
Mr. Gibbin, your old teacher...

10:51.302 --> 10:53.361
somebody cut him,
ear to ear.

10:53.470 --> 10:56.633
- That your idea of payback?
- Gibbs?

10:56.740 --> 10:59.868
Nah, Gibbs wasn't no rat.

10:59.977 --> 11:01.877
He was always trying
to keep me straight.

11:01.979 --> 11:06.678
I'd screw up and we'd talk,
but he'd never take it to 5-O.

11:07.551 --> 11:09.746
They cut him?

11:09.853 --> 11:12.151
Head almost completely off.

11:14.024 --> 11:17.016
Sheriff tells me the kid
didn't have any colors before he hitJuvie...

11:17.127 --> 11:19.755
but to stay alive,
he had to claim Spookstreet.

11:19.863 --> 11:22.229
- He could be covering for his crew.
- Spookstreet supplied rock...

11:22.333 --> 11:24.460
to the house our victim
gave up on Rivermore.

11:24.568 --> 11:26.536
- Uh-huh.
- Puts them in the middle of both killings.

11:26.637 --> 11:30.038
- And off of Antwon's plate.
- Well, not necessarily.

11:30.140 --> 11:32.404
Pull in all the unis
assigned to Spookstreet.

11:32.509 --> 11:36.707
I'll do you one better.
Danny's baby-mama C.I. is a Spookstreet ho.

11:36.814 --> 11:40.250
- She's watching cable in a safe house on our dime.
- The one with the two-year-old?

11:40.351 --> 11:43.479
All her tips have been on One-niners.
She'd never give up her own.

11:43.587 --> 11:46.112
Danny knows her pretty well.
She thinks she might have a soft spot.

11:46.223 --> 11:49.056
It's worth a shot.
Bring her in here.

11:49.159 --> 11:51.389
I have a theory...

11:51.495 --> 11:53.395
about the leaks.

11:55.866 --> 11:59.393
Isn't Aceveda's office reviewing
every one of the seizures?

11:59.503 --> 12:01.403
I thought of that.

12:01.505 --> 12:03.496
I see him pulling
political moves...

12:03.607 --> 12:06.201
not moves that actually
get people's throats cut.

12:06.310 --> 12:09.575
I'm not pointing any fingers.
It's just a notion.

12:12.182 --> 12:15.515
You've given us some great intel
on the One-niners.

12:15.619 --> 12:17.780
And you pay good money
for the things I hear.

12:17.888 --> 12:22.621
Anyone in Spookstreet taking it upon themselves
to pay back people they think might be rats?

12:22.726 --> 12:24.523
Everyone wants to know
who's been talkin'.

12:24.628 --> 12:26.528
Getting the cops to take
their houses and shit.

12:26.630 --> 12:30.623
[Sighs]
/t's a good thing / keep my mouth shut.

12:30.734 --> 12:33.168
But Spookstreet is in the middle
of both killings.

12:33.270 --> 12:35.830
- You must've heard something?
- I can't help you.

12:35.939 --> 12:39.306
Sure, you can.
How much is it gonna cost us?

12:39.410 --> 12:41.571
Money's for One-niner shit only.

12:41.678 --> 12:45.307
Spookstreet's my blood.
I ain't spillin'.

12:45.416 --> 12:47.714
[Danny]
Let me talk to her?

12:49.920 --> 12:51.785
[Claudette]
What did he look like?

12:51.889 --> 12:53.789
[Dutch]
He already said he doesn't remember.

12:53.891 --> 12:57.622
- He was black.
- I got that. Any identifying features?

12:57.728 --> 13:00.629
Guy beat my head with a bottle.
I was unconscious.

13:00.731 --> 13:03.199
I'm lucky I remember
my own name.

13:03.300 --> 13:05.200
[Claudette]
How much did he get away with?

13:05.302 --> 13:07.202
At this hour,
maybe 300.

13:07.304 --> 13:10.796
[Dutch] We need you to, uh,
check the receipts, tally a total.

13:10.908 --> 13:13.775
So, a black guy comes in,
attacks you...

13:13.877 --> 13:17.540
and next thing you remember
is a different guy dialing 911 for help?

13:17.648 --> 13:19.548
You ever try
writing this shit down?

13:19.650 --> 13:21.641
[Dutch]
Come on. We got his statement.

13:21.752 --> 13:23.652
[Bells Jingling]

13:23.754 --> 13:25.745
[Man]
/ was by my car pumping gas.

13:25.856 --> 13:27.881
I look up, I see somebody
hitting the clerk.

13:27.991 --> 13:29.982
- You got a good look inside the station?
- Uh, not really.

13:30.094 --> 13:32.688
It wasn't till he came outside
that I got a good look at him.

13:32.796 --> 13:35.822
- Hot off the press.
- You should work that up into a flyer.

13:35.933 --> 13:39.733
- I thought he'd get another look at it again first.
- Looks great to me. Right?

13:39.837 --> 13:42.032
How do you know?
You never saw the guy.

13:42.139 --> 13:43.834
That's him.
I have a good eye for detail.

13:43.941 --> 13:45.932
We appreciate it.
/f we need anything else, we'll call you.

13:46.043 --> 13:48.841
- Okay.
- Thanks. This way.

13:52.049 --> 13:54.347
Hey, Julien.
Captain got you riding the desk?

13:54.451 --> 13:56.351
Yeah, until
my complaint's addressed.

13:56.453 --> 13:59.115
The stand you're taking
sets a great example.

13:59.223 --> 14:01.885
Let me know
if you need anything.

14:01.992 --> 14:04.586
Hey, listen,
since I got you...

14:04.695 --> 14:08.461
a Jag dinged Aurora's car in the Gelson's
parking lot and took off without stopping.

14:08.565 --> 14:10.863
Do me a favor,
run the plates.

14:10.968 --> 14:12.629
- Uh, sure.
- Thanks.

14:16.106 --> 14:18.597
- Thanks for coming down.
- Sure.

14:19.776 --> 14:23.041
- [Clears Throat]
- So, uh, how can / help?

14:23.147 --> 14:26.116
We're afraid our seizure C.I. list
has been compromised.

14:26.216 --> 14:29.674
/s there any chance
there's a leak on your end?

14:29.786 --> 14:32.220
My end?
That's ridiculous.

14:32.322 --> 14:36.656
You just took office.
You sure you vetted everyone on staff properly?

14:36.760 --> 14:39.558
They've got confidential police documents
running across their desks.

14:39.663 --> 14:42.689
I'll call I.A.D. myself.
We've got nothing to hide.

14:42.799 --> 14:44.994
What'd they say
about this place?

14:45.102 --> 14:47.730
I'm still investigating.

14:47.838 --> 14:50.807
Oh, so you haven't had I.A.D. in here?
You haven't run Mackey?

14:50.908 --> 14:53.103
Vic may have a hard-on
for authority...

14:53.210 --> 14:55.303
but he would never
put innocents at risk.

14:55.412 --> 14:57.312
He's not the leak.

14:57.414 --> 15:00.247
Have /.A.D. here in the morning.
My staff will be happy to speak with them...

15:00.350 --> 15:02.750
as soon as
they finish with Vic.

15:08.425 --> 15:11.485
You know you're safe here.

15:11.595 --> 15:13.495
But you also know
that living the way you do...

15:13.597 --> 15:17.226
one foot in with the bangers, one foot trying
to get out, it's never gonna work.

15:17.334 --> 15:19.802
- I got no place to go.
- Well, that's what the money's for.

15:19.903 --> 15:22.030
- It's a big world out there.
- Single black mom-

15:22.139 --> 15:24.471
I just pick up
and move to Beverly Hills?

15:24.575 --> 15:29.035
Stayin'half-in is gonna get you killed.
Or Malcolm.

15:29.146 --> 15:32.081
Maybe not now, maybe not next year,
but somewhere down the line.

15:32.182 --> 15:35.549
I'm safe with Spookstreet. If I go off on my own,
who am I gonna count on?

15:35.652 --> 15:37.552
You think you can count on
those assholes?

15:37.654 --> 15:39.713
Those guys and their hos will
slash your neck...

15:39.823 --> 15:42.087
if they found out that
you ratted on the One-niners.

15:45.329 --> 15:49.459
Come on. Why don't we just take the baby
right now? We'll go get him inked with gang tats.

15:53.403 --> 15:55.303
So, it's a done deal,
isn't it?

15:55.405 --> 15:58.932
He's gonna wear colors.
You're gonna wear black to his funeral.

16:00.944 --> 16:04.380
She says that if any one of
the Spookstreeters did the slashings...

16:04.481 --> 16:07.177
they'd get a brand
before the day's out.

16:07.284 --> 16:08.979
Some guy named Skitch
is doing 'em all now.

16:09.086 --> 16:11.020
Check it out.

16:11.154 --> 16:14.715
He comes in for looseys
two or three times a week.

16:14.825 --> 16:17.555
- What's a loosey?
- You don't know what a loosey is?

16:17.661 --> 16:18.929
A single
loose cigarette-loosey.

16:18.929 --> 16:20.055
A single
loose cigarette-loosey.

16:20.163 --> 16:23.064
- [Claudette] You sure it's the same guy?
- He makes me break a pack.

16:23.166 --> 16:26.499
/'m not supposed to, but he winds up buying
it anyways, one smoke at a time.

16:26.603 --> 16:28.400
Wh-What else
can you tell us about him?

16:28.505 --> 16:31.804
He comes in for looseys two, three times a week.
Looks just like that.

16:31.908 --> 16:34.604
- Sorry.
- If he comes in again, you give us a call, all right?

16:34.711 --> 16:36.611
[Bells Jingling]

16:41.585 --> 16:44.748
[Engine Starting]

16:46.390 --> 16:48.358
[Bells Jingling]

16:50.127 --> 16:52.027
Where are you going?

16:52.129 --> 16:55.223
That guy was standing out there
like he was waiting for us to clear out.

17:00.771 --> 17:02.830
[Rock]

17:04.775 --> 17:07.073
That's a buck, 20.

17:07.176 --> 17:09.974
Hey. Hey. Police.
Don't throw that coffee.

17:10.079 --> 17:12.241
Shit!

17:12.348 --> 17:15.477
Stay down. Stay down.
You're under arrest.

17:17.587 --> 17:19.578
- You okay?
- Yeah. You?

17:19.690 --> 17:22.488
We just caught
the big, bad "Coffee Bandit."

17:22.592 --> 17:24.492
We've been looking
for you, "Starbuck."

17:24.594 --> 17:27.256
- [Continues]
- I told you to wear your vest.

17:27.364 --> 17:30.356
[Chuckles]

17:31.902 --> 17:36.100
Yo, Skitch! We're looking to skin
some Spookstreet hide.

17:36.206 --> 17:38.197
You brand any today?

17:38.308 --> 17:41.004
- Nope.
- None?

17:41.111 --> 17:43.841
No one came in here looking for
a grim reaper on their ass?

17:43.947 --> 17:47.747
Id have remembered that.
I can heat up a swastika for you though, Adolf.

17:47.851 --> 17:50.342
Hey, Vic, why don't I wait in the car?

17:50.454 --> 17:53.082
I'll let the two of you
maybe talk in private?

17:56.326 --> 18:00.786
Works for me. Don't mind
any strange noises emanating from this area.

18:00.897 --> 18:05.061
Okay. Okay.
/ see how we're doin

18:05.168 --> 18:07.728
Maybe there were
two other guys around here.

18:07.838 --> 18:12.673
But you keep my name out of it though.
These guys ain't too fond of snitches.

18:12.776 --> 18:16.075
Okay. This is Hook.
This is Cutter-10.

18:16.179 --> 18:20.013
Plainclothes unit has them
spotted on Blythe and Fountain.

18:20.117 --> 18:23.814
Uh, Curtis,
I need you to take point.

18:23.920 --> 18:26.480
Uh, Billings and /
have been workin'this.

18:26.590 --> 18:28.490
You're staying.

18:31.061 --> 18:34.758
[Chuckles] Real estate between me
and anything seizure-related.

18:34.865 --> 18:36.765
You did a great job finding
these assholes...

18:36.867 --> 18:39.802
and you'll get a chance to interrogate them
when the others bring them in.

18:39.903 --> 18:41.837
- But you cannot be the arresting officer.
- Mm-hmm.

18:41.938 --> 18:43.963
I appreciate you understanding.

18:57.554 --> 18:59.454
[Curtis On Radio]
Go. Go.

18:59.556 --> 19:01.046
[Tires Screeching]

19:02.959 --> 19:06.395
- Get your hands where I can see 'em!
- Freeze! Get out of the car!

19:06.496 --> 19:09.329
Get out of the car!
Get out of the car!

19:09.433 --> 19:12.027
Hey, get out.
Get out of the car right now.

19:12.135 --> 19:14.433
You heard the lady.

19:14.538 --> 19:16.438
- Get down.
- [Groans]

19:16.540 --> 19:18.132
Got something.

19:18.275 --> 19:19.867
- [Man] Come on, man.
- [Officer] Shut up.

19:19.976 --> 19:22.410
[Grunts]

19:22.512 --> 19:26.608
[Door Opens, Closes]

19:26.716 --> 19:29.344
[Mackey]
Victim's blood, your fingerprints.

19:29.453 --> 19:32.445
Somebody should've branded
"dumb shit" on your forehead.

19:32.556 --> 19:35.286
Yeah, but it took a whole fleet
of blue to bring me in though, didn't it?

19:35.392 --> 19:37.792
What's your reason
for killing anyone helping us?

19:37.894 --> 19:40.829
/ ain't got no problem with the po-po
cleaning up the streets.

19:40.931 --> 19:42.865
That's what white law
gets paid for.

19:42.966 --> 19:45.764
[Mackey]
You just don't like anyone cooperating with us.

19:45.869 --> 19:48.337
Come on, my man, some dick
buys himself a brand-new Caddy...

19:48.438 --> 19:50.429
he ridin' around
like he's some kind of mack.

19:50.540 --> 19:52.440
People gonna thank me
for doing him.

19:52.542 --> 19:56.069
As a matter of fact, you make sure
the pen hears all about it before I sit down.

19:56.179 --> 19:58.079
What about the teacher?

19:58.181 --> 20:00.376
You looking to make your bones
for the kids in detention?

20:00.484 --> 20:03.476
Nah. Nah, he was
a snitch's snitch, man.

20:03.587 --> 20:06.317
Everybody knew that he the one
that gave up that One-niner's drug den.

20:06.423 --> 20:09.483
Ah, we'll show you the books.
He wasn't our informant on anything.

20:09.593 --> 20:12.824
What kind of cred's killing
some innocent dude buy you in the can, huh?

20:12.929 --> 20:17.025
He wasn't innocent, man. He- He was a rat,
big time. Everybody knew he was rattin'.

20:17.133 --> 20:21.832
You got played, man. People found out
you got all worked up about snitches...

20:21.938 --> 20:25.237
just gave you a name
to settle some personal score.

20:25.342 --> 20:28.140
[Monica] We'll make sure they hear
about that in the pen too.

20:28.245 --> 20:32.477
Someone punked you like that?
You're not going to let them share the pain?

20:35.752 --> 20:38.243
[Chuckling]

20:38.355 --> 20:40.880
Some breezy-
she one of his students.

20:40.991 --> 20:43.255
Tracy something.

20:44.361 --> 20:47.023
She on the drill team, man.

20:47.163 --> 20:49.791
I'm not admittin'
to anything, so-

20:49.900 --> 20:52.801
Sure, whatever. We-We're bringing in
the other clerks to identify you.

20:52.903 --> 20:55.303
They're pissed.
They'll remember.

20:55.405 --> 20:58.238
[Sighs]
You know, uh...

20:58.341 --> 21:03.278
every once in a while somebody commits
a crime that we cops have to smile at.

21:03.380 --> 21:06.747
Yeah. A hot cup of coffee,
no other weapon is brilliant.

21:06.850 --> 21:08.977
Pour it, pay for it- bam.

21:09.085 --> 21:11.747
You're back home
before the guy's washing off.

21:11.855 --> 21:15.291
- [Laughing]
- Any dumb-shit criminal can use a gun, you know?

21:15.392 --> 21:17.326
Where'd you think
of the idea?

21:17.427 --> 21:19.657
Some broad threw coffee
in my face.

21:19.763 --> 21:22.960
I remember thinking to myself,
l-l-I'm lucky this isn't hot.

21:23.066 --> 21:25.193
[Laughing]

21:25.302 --> 21:26.860
After that,
it all came together.

21:28.138 --> 21:30.333
/ heard you took one
in the line of duty.

21:30.440 --> 21:32.806
The Coffee Bandit
is now in custody.

21:32.909 --> 21:36.504
- Dutch did a great job.
- It was a team thing.

21:36.613 --> 21:39.343
Congratulations.

21:39.449 --> 21:42.816
- We'll pay to have your suit dry-cleaned.
- [Chuckles] Thanks.

21:42.919 --> 21:46.013
Anything on the gas station assault
that put you there in the first place?

21:46.122 --> 21:48.590
Uh, suspect's
a part-time smoker.

21:48.692 --> 21:51.126
He'd go into the gas station
a couple times a week for looseys.

21:51.227 --> 21:53.195
I used to pay
a dime for mine.

21:53.296 --> 21:55.196
Ah, the good old days.

21:55.298 --> 21:57.766
You were both smokers, huh?

21:59.970 --> 22:03.838
Uh, the suspect's sketch has been
put in every gas station in the area.

22:03.940 --> 22:06.340
So if he lives nearby,
maybe he'll hit another one.

22:06.443 --> 22:08.411
Good work.

22:13.316 --> 22:16.979
A meeting got canceled.
I figured I'd take a chance.

22:17.087 --> 22:19.146
- Expecting someone?
- No.

22:19.255 --> 22:22.782
But, uh, you need to call first.
You know, you can't just drop by.

22:22.892 --> 22:26.191
Right. I might
run into your sister.

22:26.296 --> 22:28.196
How is she?

22:28.298 --> 22:30.596
This isn't how it works.

22:31.868 --> 22:34.359
Please leave now.

22:34.471 --> 22:36.371
Go.

22:36.473 --> 22:39.806
This place, your clothes,
your hair-

22:39.909 --> 22:41.809
It must all add up, huh?

22:41.911 --> 22:44.675
- That's why you bring the gifts.
- [Door Closes]

22:44.781 --> 22:48.444
As nice as Dell Rossetti's?
Did you forget I'm a police officer?

22:48.551 --> 22:50.883
Your bullshit lies
don't work on me.

22:50.987 --> 22:53.512
- He's a friend.
- You don't have friends. You have clients.

22:54.724 --> 22:57.955
/'m guessing Rossetti's
a generous one.

22:58.061 --> 23:00.928
But then again,
he showed up empty-handed.

23:01.031 --> 23:03.022
Maybe we're standing
in his gift.

23:05.335 --> 23:08.498
He the reason you changed your hair?
He prefer blondes?

23:08.605 --> 23:10.732
/ told you a lie
to keep our lie alive.

23:10.840 --> 23:12.808
You want to puncture that balloon,
that's your deal.

23:12.909 --> 23:15.673
Yeah? Well, what's
this guy's flavor, huh?

23:15.779 --> 23:18.043
Up the ass?
Shitting on you?

23:18.148 --> 23:21.948
You don't get to talk to me like that.
Not even when I'm on the clock.

23:22.052 --> 23:25.180
Well, Rossetti can certainly afford
the all-access pass.

23:25.288 --> 23:28.587
He's got condos going up
all over the city.

23:28.692 --> 23:32.219
- We don't talk business.
- From what / can tell, he cuts corners...

23:32.328 --> 23:35.627
which could land him in some
serious trouble with the authorities.

23:35.732 --> 23:39.190
/ don't know what shit you're trying
to work through with me, but it's not working.

23:39.302 --> 23:41.202
You know, he got married
a couple years ago.

23:41.304 --> 23:45.070
If the wife has any brains,
she put a cheating clause in the prenup.

23:45.175 --> 23:49.043
You gonna call her?
Sort of a bitch move, don't you think?

23:49.145 --> 23:52.012
I don't think
she'd see it that way.

23:52.115 --> 23:55.346
Or I could call my friends
in the D.A.'s office.

23:55.452 --> 23:57.283
I could call
my friends in the P.D.

23:57.387 --> 23:59.480
I could hit him with
a dozen different shit storms...

23:59.589 --> 24:01.614
and my fingerprints
wouldn't be on any of them.

24:01.725 --> 24:04.353
You've got a wife too.

24:04.461 --> 24:07.589
Should I let her know
how to make you happy at home?

24:08.865 --> 24:11.891
Oh, you wouldn't do that,
not to me.

24:12.001 --> 24:15.266
'Cause you're
so powerful, right?

24:15.371 --> 24:17.931
You want to see
the things I can do?

24:22.245 --> 24:24.270
[Sighs]

24:24.380 --> 24:26.905
Look, David...

24:27.016 --> 24:30.383
I like our time together.

24:30.487 --> 24:34.014
Let's not screw it up
over something stupid.

24:34.124 --> 24:37.821
Just tell me
what you want.

24:41.064 --> 24:44.158
I don't come second
to anyone.

24:48.671 --> 24:50.901
- You're working today.
- Yeah. What-What are you doing here?

24:51.007 --> 24:55.535
Uh, I'm just trying to catch Vic. Kid stuff.
What happened to your suit?

24:55.645 --> 24:59.411
Uh, takedown got pretty messy.
It's no problem. We got the guy.

24:59.516 --> 25:02.542
- Great. We'll celebrate later.
- [Chuckles] There's Vic.

25:02.652 --> 25:06.748
Uh, listen, I've got a robbery
I'm working on, so I'll talk to you later.

25:06.856 --> 25:09.347
/ got a pretty full plate.
What's going on?

25:09.459 --> 25:12.223
/ heard back from that clinical trial
/ signed Megan up for.

25:12.328 --> 25:14.694
- Uh-huh.
- She's not eligible.

25:14.798 --> 25:17.596
[Sighs]
Shit. Come on.

25:22.572 --> 25:24.665
- She's under three years old.
- [Door Closes]

25:24.774 --> 25:27.242
Second kid in the family with autism.
Isn't that what they wanted?

25:27.343 --> 25:29.607
/t's not Megan.
/t's us. Our lawsuit.

25:29.712 --> 25:33.113
Pyren Pharmaceuticals excludes
anyone with pending legal action against them.

25:33.216 --> 25:36.777
Wait a minute. First, these are the people
who make the vaccines that make our kids sick...

25:36.886 --> 25:39.514
and then they're the goddamn gatekeepers
of the ones who get better?

25:39.622 --> 25:42.113
I spoke to Mamyn.
We can drop out of the lawsuit if we want.

25:42.225 --> 25:46.355
- It's just the money that we sunk into the tests.
- We're not eating 15 grand!

25:46.462 --> 25:50.899
These clinical trials- I've seen video of kids who-
they haven't even talked.

25:51.000 --> 25:53.298
And now they're playing
and they're laughing.

25:53.403 --> 25:54.938
That'll never be Matthew...

25:54.938 --> 25:55.905
That'll never be Matthew...

25:56.005 --> 25:58.269
but Megan
still has a chance.

25:58.374 --> 26:00.399
Or she could end up being
the one eatin' the sugar pill.

26:00.510 --> 26:02.410
She shouldn't miss out.

26:02.512 --> 26:06.380
But this lawsuit was our one chance
for financial security for Matthew.

26:06.482 --> 26:09.883
/- / don't know
what to do.

26:13.289 --> 26:15.189
I'll take care of it.

26:18.828 --> 26:21.092
- [Tools Whirring]
- [Chattering]

26:23.600 --> 26:26.125
- There he is.
- Hey!

26:27.704 --> 26:31.037
H-H-Hey, I been
lookin' for you all day.

26:31.140 --> 26:33.870
Don't know why the "helping out kids" angle
wasn't my first stop.

26:33.977 --> 26:35.877
Hop in.

26:35.979 --> 26:38.675
- I have something you're gonna wanna hear.
- I'll hear it right here, man.

26:38.781 --> 26:41.511
What, I ain't forget what happened
last time I conferenced with you two.

26:41.618 --> 26:46.282
I got you and the 4-H Club a new road
to heroin. You should take this ride.

26:46.389 --> 26:49.051
Come on.

26:49.158 --> 26:51.626
Let's go.

26:53.129 --> 26:55.029
- Little Pop-
- Mm-hmm.

26:55.131 --> 26:57.565
Los Mag O.G. -
he owes me a favor.

26:57.667 --> 26:59.897
They got a Nogales
Customs agent on payroll.

27:00.003 --> 27:02.563
Tar slips over
the Arizona border.

27:02.672 --> 27:06.039
- Just a Sunday drive away.
- Antwon's beefing with the wetbacks.

27:06.142 --> 27:08.042
That's why
we use the El Salvadorans.

27:08.144 --> 27:09.975
That's where
the deal gets interesting though.

27:10.079 --> 27:12.604
We know you were next in line
to be the One-niner don.

27:12.715 --> 27:16.583
Antwon got sprung,
decided to reclaim his crown.

27:18.621 --> 27:20.555
Things change, you know?

27:20.657 --> 27:23.683
You wanna live,
you change with 'em.

27:23.793 --> 27:26.023
Well, it's time
for another change, brother.

27:30.233 --> 27:32.929
Those Mags are willing to work
with the new One-niner's boss.

27:33.036 --> 27:35.596
That's you.

27:35.705 --> 27:37.639
Ain't a smilin' matter.

27:37.740 --> 27:41.005
Antwon keeps playing his Malcolm X games,
the heat's gonna cripple you guys.

27:41.110 --> 27:42.975
Already is.

27:43.079 --> 27:44.979
He doesn't give a shit
about the One-niners.

27:45.081 --> 27:47.948
He was just using his old set
to climb back on top.

27:51.220 --> 27:53.688
And you didn't
come up with him.

27:53.790 --> 27:56.088
You got no loyalty to him.

27:56.192 --> 27:58.285
Say what you gotta say, man.

27:58.394 --> 28:00.988
I've negotiated a deal
between you and the Los Mags.

28:01.097 --> 28:02.997
One condition...

28:03.099 --> 28:04.999
Antwon goes away.

28:05.101 --> 28:08.298
Clean, simple.

28:08.404 --> 28:11.999
Look, he's beefin' with enough people.
It's an easy pin.

28:12.108 --> 28:16.738
You step up. You earn your crew's respect
with this new product.

28:16.846 --> 28:20.976
With Antwon gone, our captain,
she loses her hard-on...

28:21.084 --> 28:23.018
P.D. backs off...

28:23.119 --> 28:26.350
injunctions go away.

28:26.456 --> 28:29.016
Brothers get back
to making money.

28:29.125 --> 28:31.025
Everybody wins.

28:31.127 --> 28:33.652
What you win, huh?

28:33.763 --> 28:36.493
That little girl's body.

28:43.106 --> 28:45.006
Mm-mmm. Nah.

28:45.108 --> 28:47.508
/ don't need to be
the head nigger in charge, man.

28:47.610 --> 28:50.340
Antwon-he can have
the limelight and the heat.

28:50.446 --> 28:52.311
- I'm gonna pass.
- Come on, man. That's thinking like a pussy.

28:52.415 --> 28:56.511
Nah. A pussy, that's someone who's willing
to off a partner to cover his own ass.

28:56.619 --> 28:59.087
- We're not talking about that.
- Kill what partner?

28:59.188 --> 29:02.055
Don't worry, Pablo, it ain't you.
Not yet anyway.

29:02.158 --> 29:03.557
- [Chuckling]
- It's nothing.

29:03.659 --> 29:05.889
Wha-Antwon wants you
to kill Mackey?

29:05.995 --> 29:09.692
No, Antwon wants a lot of things.
The question is, what does this guy want?

29:09.799 --> 29:12.461
I've got a deal on the table.
It's in your best interests.

29:12.568 --> 29:15.128
That's your opinion.
/'m gonna tell Antwon we chatted.

29:15.238 --> 29:17.900
- Come on. Where you going? We're still talking.
- You stay right there.

29:18.007 --> 29:19.406
You better
control your boy.

29:19.509 --> 29:21.977
- That's not the way to handle this.
- How do we do this, boss?

29:22.078 --> 29:24.638
He downloads to Antwon, and we're
dick deep in dead girls and bullets!

29:24.747 --> 29:27.113
- Yo, handle this shit.
- Hey, put it away.

29:27.216 --> 29:29.776
Put the thing away. Okay?

29:29.886 --> 29:31.649
The Los Mags think that
I've been dealing in your name.

29:31.754 --> 29:34.120
- You back out of this, man, they're not-
- [Gunshot]

29:34.223 --> 29:36.418
- l- l- I didn't mean that.
- Jesus Christ!

29:36.526 --> 29:39.120
- I didn't mean it!
- That asshole shot me, man!

29:39.228 --> 29:41.992
- What the hell are you thinking?
- That asshole shot me.

29:42.098 --> 29:44.692
What's wrong with y'all?

29:44.801 --> 29:47.269
Holy shit.

29:49.372 --> 29:53.274
- Why didn't you tell me about Vic?
- Now's not the time.

29:53.376 --> 29:56.345
- [Dispatcher On Radio]
6-Paul-24. 6-Paul-24. Come in.
- [Groaning]

29:56.446 --> 29:59.006
- What the hell have you gotten us into?
- Shut up!

29:59.115 --> 30:01.583
- Everyone, just shut up!
- 24, 6-Paul-

30:01.684 --> 30:04.209
[Radio Turns Off]

30:04.320 --> 30:06.788
Jesus.

30:06.889 --> 30:09.153
All right.
Where's that little girl's body?

30:09.258 --> 30:12.557
- I ain't sayin' shit!
- I can drop you at a hospital...

30:12.662 --> 30:14.755
or I can let you
bleed out in the desert.

30:14.864 --> 30:17.094
Where did Antwon put her?

30:19.802 --> 30:23.101
Okay, fine. Fine.
Next stop, Joshua Tree.

30:23.206 --> 30:26.073
[Engine Starts]

30:26.209 --> 30:29.770
[Monica] We heard that your teacher
failed you for cutting class.

30:29.879 --> 30:33.713
You think I slit his throat?
I'm half his size.

30:33.816 --> 30:38.116
Everyone knows you busted
Hook and Cutter-10 already. I ain't scared of you.

30:38.221 --> 30:40.314
We need to know who else
you've been talking trash about.

30:40.423 --> 30:44.223
/f you've been shooting your mouth,
your goddamn lynch mob might go after them.

30:44.327 --> 30:46.227
Why you ain't out
arresting Dynamite?

30:46.329 --> 30:48.229
That nigga running girls
on a track.

30:48.331 --> 30:50.697
Or my mail-lady-
she's running numbers, for Christ's sakes.

30:50.800 --> 30:52.768
So, the code of silence
is for everyone else?

30:52.869 --> 30:56.430
Everybody got their own code.
That's the only law out there.

30:56.539 --> 30:59.133
Hmm. You all
just something to get around.

30:59.242 --> 31:02.769
Well, you're not getting
around us today.

31:02.879 --> 31:05.370
We're booking you for
conspiracy to commit murder...

31:05.481 --> 31:09.611
reckless endangerment and anything else
that we can think of.

31:17.727 --> 31:21.128
- Bullshit charges will never fly.
- We're supposed to let her walk?

31:21.230 --> 31:24.666
- There's no law against trash-talkin'.
- She knew the climate out there.

31:24.767 --> 31:27.327
She used it to get
a schoolteacher killed.

31:27.436 --> 31:29.870
You'll never prove intent.
It's a loser.

31:29.972 --> 31:32.031
She's tuned into what's going on out there.
We're not.

31:32.141 --> 31:35.440
I am s-sick
of being blindsided by it.

31:38.614 --> 31:41.412
I'm gonna move
into that house.

31:41.517 --> 31:44.486
You want to drop yourself in the middle
of all that crap? Good luck.

31:44.587 --> 31:48.853
The only way to be a real catalyst
for change is to leap in the mix...

31:48.958 --> 31:50.858
show them you're
right there with them.

31:53.863 --> 31:55.763
They won't give a shit.

31:55.865 --> 31:57.958
Not at first.

32:01.537 --> 32:03.903
Good work
closing this one.

32:05.708 --> 32:08.802
Zerkow, how are we
on patrols tonight?

32:08.911 --> 32:11.971
- Short. Why?
- Captain's moving into the hood.

32:12.081 --> 32:13.981
- You're kidding.
- I wish.

32:14.083 --> 32:17.883
Point of pride with her though.
She won't order up extra patrols for herself.

32:17.987 --> 32:20.717
But we're gonna make sure
no assholes get any cute ideas.

32:20.823 --> 32:22.723
- I'll put it in effect tomorrow.
- Thanks.

32:22.825 --> 32:24.725
I'll look in on her tonight.

32:24.827 --> 32:27.318
[Clears Throat] Heard you were right in
the thick of things out there.

32:27.430 --> 32:30.228
Uh, I shouldn't have
broken that damn window.

32:30.333 --> 32:31.901
It's bullshit
you couldn't be with us.

32:31.901 --> 32:32.765
It's bullshit
you couldn't be with us.

32:32.868 --> 32:34.495
- Next time.
- Hey, um, Vic...

32:34.604 --> 32:36.504
you wanna grab
a beer or somethin'?

32:36.606 --> 32:39.166
- Big bust like that, I sure
could blow off some steam.
- I can't.

32:39.275 --> 32:41.402
I got something with the kids,
and then a stakeout.

32:41.510 --> 32:44.138
All right. Well, if you want some company
for the stakeout, give me a call.

32:44.247 --> 32:46.715
I'm still a little wired.

32:46.816 --> 32:48.716
Okay.

32:51.887 --> 32:54.947
- [Shane] Wake up. Where is she?
- She's in the crapper on the right.

32:55.057 --> 32:56.957
She's buried underneath,
wrapped in plastic.

32:57.059 --> 33:00.324
- Jesus.
- Not only do you kill her,
you gotta shit on her too!

33:00.429 --> 33:02.294
Methane helps hide
the death smell.

33:02.398 --> 33:04.298
- [Horn Honking]
- Gotta get me some help.

33:04.400 --> 33:07.369
- What time's this place shut down?
- /t don't shut down.

33:07.470 --> 33:09.836
The-The shelter's
got guards 24-7, man.

33:09.939 --> 33:12.533
- How we gonna get her out?
- / don't know.

33:12.642 --> 33:15.304
- [Tires Screeching]
- / don't know.

33:16.846 --> 33:18.905
What are you doing?

33:28.324 --> 33:30.792
- [Groaning]
- I send unis to recover that body...

33:30.893 --> 33:32.861
you and Antwon will be
waist deep in shit too.

33:32.962 --> 33:36.159
- You try to move it, I'll nail it in transit. Okay?
- [Grunts]

33:36.265 --> 33:38.529
We can't just
leave him here.

33:38.634 --> 33:41.501
You tell Antwon /'m done with his shit-
all of it.

33:41.604 --> 33:46.303
He tries to come after us,
my family, or Vic...

33:46.409 --> 33:48.707
I'll walk up to him
and I'll put a bullet in his head.

33:48.811 --> 33:51.837
You got that?
You got that?

33:53.816 --> 33:56.376
Move. Get out of my way.

33:57.486 --> 33:59.477
[Door Shuts]

33:59.588 --> 34:01.556
[Door Shuts]

34:04.393 --> 34:06.293
I'm so sorry we can't-
[Indistinct]

34:06.395 --> 34:07.953
[Rossetti]
What are you talkin'about?

34:08.063 --> 34:09.964
Tomorrow night.

34:11.300 --> 34:13.199
All right.

34:17.473 --> 34:19.407
- [Knocking]
- [Radio: Pop]

34:21.143 --> 34:23.304
Was that like you wanted?

34:25.447 --> 34:27.973
[Gasps]
That's too hard.

34:28.083 --> 34:30.917
[Gasps, Pants]

34:31.020 --> 34:35.422
No! You're too powerful.

34:35.524 --> 34:38.550
[Whimpering]

34:38.661 --> 34:40.561
[Gasping]

34:40.663 --> 34:43.496
No!
[Gasping]

34:44.900 --> 34:47.960
[Moaning]
/t's so big.

34:48.103 --> 34:51.164
Hey, Detective, did you talk
to that guy who was looking for you?

34:51.273 --> 34:53.867
- What guy?
- He said something about a mini-mart.

34:53.976 --> 34:56.570
Uh, where is he?

35:00.149 --> 35:02.049
You looking for me?

35:02.151 --> 35:04.711
- You the one handling the gas station beatings?
- Yeah.

35:04.820 --> 35:08.415
Yeah, that was me.

35:09.525 --> 35:12.426
Y-You're here
to turn yourself in?

35:12.528 --> 35:14.894
After I finish this,
I'll tell you all about it.

35:16.699 --> 35:18.929
Take your time.

35:19.034 --> 35:22.936
All I needed was one cigarette,
and then I'm good.

35:23.038 --> 35:26.269
- If I buy a pack-
- Smoke 'em all.

35:26.375 --> 35:28.400
So what happened
in the store?

35:28.511 --> 35:31.742
This new idiot was working.

35:31.847 --> 35:34.372
I told him the other clerk
always busts a pack for me...

35:34.483 --> 35:36.246
but he wouldn't do it.

35:36.352 --> 35:38.320
I told him.
I said, "I'm trying to quit."

35:38.421 --> 35:41.083
I'm begging him-
"Show me some love."

35:41.190 --> 35:44.216
But he wanted
to be an asshole, and...

35:44.326 --> 35:46.556
I lost it.
[Breathing Heavily]

35:46.662 --> 35:49.324
Just-Just one cigarette.

35:50.900 --> 35:52.891
And $300.

35:54.069 --> 35:56.196
What?

35:56.305 --> 35:58.830
You stole $300
from the register.

35:58.941 --> 36:00.841
Maybe now you can afford
the whole pack.

36:00.943 --> 36:04.709
No. I came here
to admit my wrong.

36:04.814 --> 36:06.714
I shouldn't have
hit that man...

36:08.617 --> 36:10.710
and I'll take
my punishment...

36:10.820 --> 36:12.720
but I'm not a thief.

36:20.062 --> 36:23.463
Police intel's making
its way into the street.

36:23.566 --> 36:25.932
I thought those slashings
was a little girl playing witch-hunt.

36:26.035 --> 36:30.404
Yeah, they were.
But we never did find our missing C./., Angie.

36:30.506 --> 36:34.465
We never determined who tipped off
that warehouse raid when D.E.A. was in town.

36:34.577 --> 36:36.568
Sounds like
plain old bad intel.

36:36.679 --> 36:40.410
I thought all you guys took cynical pills.
Are you I.A.D. or not?

36:40.516 --> 36:42.484
At your service.
What's my cover?

36:42.585 --> 36:45.349
/'m gonna put you in
as part of the Gang Task Force.

36:45.454 --> 36:47.979
You'll be working
with Vic Mackey.

36:48.090 --> 36:51.491
His name's run across our desks a few times.
You think he's involved?

36:51.594 --> 36:54.461
No. But I need to prove
to someone that he's not.

36:57.166 --> 37:00.067
l- I told you,
we don't have to decide tonight.

37:05.774 --> 37:07.674
What's going on?

37:07.776 --> 37:09.744
You need to take this.

37:19.622 --> 37:21.522
You've been
hiding money from me?

37:21.624 --> 37:24.286
This isn't
about ducking alimony.

37:24.393 --> 37:26.293
I wanna take care
of my children.

37:27.596 --> 37:29.496
Where did this come from?
Where did you get this?

37:29.598 --> 37:31.498
The money's clean.

37:31.600 --> 37:35.297
Just make sure you don't deposit more
than five grand every couple of months.

37:35.404 --> 37:37.668
Do it.

37:37.773 --> 37:41.140
- [Zipper Closes]
- Don't bring this in the house. I don't want it.

37:41.243 --> 37:45.043
You want to drop the lawsuit,
get Megan into that clinical trial?

37:45.147 --> 37:47.047
This is how you do it.

37:48.551 --> 37:50.576
Use this for Matty.

37:51.954 --> 37:53.854
I wanna go
kiss the kids good night.

37:53.956 --> 37:56.948
- They're asleep.
- I'm not gonna wake them up.

37:57.059 --> 37:59.357
Why did you have me
take Cassidy tonight?

38:00.462 --> 38:03.124
Are you okay?

38:03.232 --> 38:05.598
Nothing I can't handle.

38:11.507 --> 38:13.566
I want to say good night
to the kids.

38:14.910 --> 38:17.003
It feels like good-bye.

38:19.815 --> 38:21.908
- Vic?
- [Door Opens]

38:23.819 --> 38:25.810
[Door Closes]

38:39.335 --> 38:41.235
[Sighs]

38:44.506 --> 38:47.839
[Helicopter Whirring]

38:47.943 --> 38:49.843
You're pretty quiet tonight.

38:51.947 --> 38:53.847
Anything you want
to talk about?

39:06.061 --> 39:08.393
Think the captain is dumb
or brave for doing this?

39:13.969 --> 39:17.200
Gang Task Force was
a pretty good idea.

39:17.306 --> 39:20.332
It sure as hell keeps me
from spinning my wheels out there, you know?

39:37.860 --> 39:39.760
Thanks for putting me up
for that.

39:44.633 --> 39:46.726
So, you wanna call it?

39:48.904 --> 39:50.804
No.

40:14.897 --> 40:16.990
Oh, Jesus. Come here.

40:22.905 --> 40:25.203
[Mackey Moans]

40:26.875 --> 40:29.105
Oh, yeah, like that.
[Moans]

40:29.211 --> 40:31.509
[Moaning]

40:33.315 --> 40:36.910
[Dutch] We just, uh, need
a few more details for your statement.

40:37.019 --> 40:41.649
After the suspect ran out, how long
did it take you to get to the victim?

40:41.757 --> 40:43.657
Uh, a few seconds.

40:43.759 --> 40:47.354
Once the thief drove off,
/ ran in, found him unconscious.

40:47.463 --> 40:49.431
Called 911.

40:49.531 --> 40:51.522
[Dutch]
Uh, anybody else there?

40:51.633 --> 40:54.466
I don't think so.
Place was empty.

40:54.570 --> 40:58.438
- Probably why he robbed it then.
- Or why you robbed it then.

41:00.709 --> 41:03.234
/ called this in.
Remember, guys?

41:03.345 --> 41:06.405
You might be smart, but you're not
criminal smart. And you're a terrible liar.

41:14.123 --> 41:17.388
I've never done
anything like this before.

41:19.862 --> 41:23.161
You always need more.
Rent goes up. Alimony.

41:23.265 --> 41:25.597
You feel so stretched.

41:25.701 --> 41:27.896
And there was some cash
just sitting there.

41:31.807 --> 41:34.537
- I'm really sorry.
- You're sorry you got caught.

41:34.643 --> 41:37.703
/f you were really sorry,
you would have turned yourself in.

41:37.813 --> 41:40.543
[Chuckles]
Come on. Who the hell would do that?

41:40.649 --> 41:43.618
[Chuckles]

41:43.752 --> 41:45.652
Shit! I can't get ahold
of his machine.

41:45.754 --> 41:48.450
What the hell kind of plan is this?
We can't even reach Shane.

41:48.557 --> 41:50.525
I don't feel right at all.

41:50.626 --> 41:53.891
Part of me wants it to go down tonight,
get this all over with.

41:53.996 --> 41:56.931
We can't let Vic go alone.
If Shane shows up, brings Army, it's two on one.

41:57.032 --> 41:58.932
- I know.
- [Door Opens]

41:59.034 --> 42:02.526
Hey, uh, where the hell's Vic?
I've been looking for him everywhere.

42:02.638 --> 42:05.106
We haven't seen him
for a while.

42:05.207 --> 42:08.802
- That's my cell.
- Yeah, watch commander found it.

42:08.911 --> 42:11.038
- Thanks for the heads-up.
- Your phone was here.
What was I supposed to call?

42:11.146 --> 42:12.977
Never mind.

42:14.316 --> 42:16.944
Easy. It's the way
Vic wants it.

42:20.389 --> 42:23.290
[Cell Phone Ringing]

42:25.594 --> 42:28.062
- Yeah.
- [Shane] Hey.

42:28.163 --> 42:30.063
Hey, I've been trying
to reach you.

42:30.165 --> 42:32.429
Look, uh-

42:32.534 --> 42:34.695
Look, I need your help
with somethin'.

42:35.871 --> 42:38.203
Can you meet me?
Just you?

42:40.342 --> 42:43.800
Yeah. Sure. Where?

42:43.912 --> 42:46.813
[Train Whistle Blowing]

42:53.355 --> 42:56.017
- [Car Door Opening]
- [Shane] Hey...

42:56.124 --> 42:58.684
- thanks for coming.
- [Car Door Closes]

42:58.794 --> 43:00.921
Uh-

43:01.029 --> 43:02.929
Look, uh-

43:06.535 --> 43:09.333
I'm in
some serious shit.

43:09.438 --> 43:11.838
Hey. Hey, what the hell
are you doing?

43:11.940 --> 43:14.909
- What the hell's the matter with you?
- Bugged your car.

43:17.346 --> 43:19.871
It's you or me, right?

43:19.982 --> 43:22.075
- I guess it's you.
- No. No, no, no. Look-

43:22.184 --> 43:24.277
l-l-I'm explaining.
Pl-Please, l-listen to me!

43:24.386 --> 43:26.286
Goddamn it. Listen to me.

43:26.388 --> 43:30.825
Antwon killed Angie right in front
of me and Army. He did it with our guns.

43:30.926 --> 43:32.826
That's what I came
to talk to you about!

43:32.928 --> 43:35.123
I thought you had
nothing to do with Antwon.

43:35.230 --> 43:37.994
That's nothing
that we haven't done before.

43:38.100 --> 43:40.125
Look, he's squeezing us.

43:40.235 --> 43:42.499
He says the body
will turn up if- if I don't-

43:43.939 --> 43:47.306
But I would never do that.
Never! You know that!

43:47.409 --> 43:50.105
Look, / was just bluffing him
to buy time.

43:50.212 --> 43:52.840
Look-
We- We took a run at Halpern.

43:52.948 --> 43:56.315
He showed us where Angie's body was,
but we can't get to it, just the two of us.

43:57.753 --> 43:59.778
Army's gun went off. It-

44:01.924 --> 44:03.824
Halpern's still alive.

44:03.926 --> 44:06.520
But once Antwon finds out,
I'm dead.

44:06.628 --> 44:10.064
/ got Mara and Jackson
out of town, but /'m-

44:10.165 --> 44:12.099
Look, I'm-
I'm in trouble, man.

44:16.271 --> 44:18.296
l- I don't know
how it got this deep.

44:30.252 --> 44:32.846
You got one shot.

44:34.623 --> 44:36.284
Take it.

44:41.830 --> 44:43.730
No.

44:45.934 --> 44:47.834
No.

44:49.304 --> 44:51.204
I would never
choose him over you.

44:53.141 --> 44:56.076
We let that money train bullshit
get in the way, but you're-

44:57.612 --> 45:00.206
- Come on. You're my friend.
