00:47.840 --> 00:51.833
Remain calm, Kryten.
This is your CPU speaking.

00:52.000 --> 00:54.275
There has been an accident.

00:54.440 --> 00:57.432
Both your legs
have been crushed beyond repair.

00:57.600 --> 00:59.955
Your ambulatory system has been destroyed,

01:00.120 --> 01:04.671
and your life expectancy
is currently estimated at 67 minutes.

01:04.840 --> 01:08.435
If there is further news,
we will keep you updated.

01:08.600 --> 01:11.114
In the meantime, here is a little music.

01:11.320 --> 01:14.835
"COPACABANA")

01:17.840 --> 01:21.037
Your auto-repair systems are now able
to restore visuals.

01:22.480 --> 01:24.789
Kryten personal black box recording.

01:24.960 --> 01:28.157
Time - unknown. Location - unknown.

01:28.320 --> 01:30.709
Cause of accident - unknown.

01:30.880 --> 01:36.989
Should someone find this recording, perhaps
it will shed light as to what happened here.

01:37.200 --> 01:39.839
My short-term memory has been erased.

01:40.000 --> 01:45.870
This I ascribe to the proximity
of the magnetic coils from Starbug's rear engine.

01:47.880 --> 01:51.475
Secondly, due to the proximity
of the magnetic coils,

01:51.640 --> 01:55.189
my short-term memory
appears to have been erased.

01:55.360 --> 01:58.796
This, combined with the erasure
of my short-term memory,

01:58.960 --> 02:01.713
has left me a little
disorient-disorient-disoriented.

02:02.280 --> 02:05.397
67 minutes?! I'd better get out of here.

02:13.880 --> 02:15.871
Of course.

02:48.120 --> 02:51.112
Can you hear me?

02:51.280 --> 02:55.796
Find an ore sample pod.
There should be plenty strewn around.

02:55.960 --> 02:59.555
Initiate the homing procedure and bring help. OK?

02:59.760 --> 03:01.910
Good luck, boy.

03:02.080 --> 03:03.877
Go on!

03:23.960 --> 03:27.669
- OK. I'm here. What's the beef?
- We've got a visitor.

03:27.840 --> 03:30.308
- What?!
- A pod arrived 20 minutes ago.

03:30.480 --> 03:32.675
Something in it has broken free.

03:32.880 --> 03:36.555
- Any ideas?
- I don't want to spread any panic or alarm.

03:38.480 --> 03:40.277
What do you mean?

03:40.480 --> 03:44.439
Well, you've always had this thing
against tarantulas, haven't you?

03:45.040 --> 03:49.875
- Tarantulas?
- You've never been overly fond of them.

03:50.080 --> 03:52.469
- Well, no.
- The prospect of waking up

03:52.640 --> 03:56.758
and finding one crawling
over your naked, helpless body

03:56.960 --> 03:59.952
fills you with a kind of cold dread?

04:00.160 --> 04:03.152
Well, yeah. What are you saying, Holly?

04:03.360 --> 04:05.669
I'm saying it might not be your night.

04:06.640 --> 04:10.315
Look. This is the best shot
security cameras could get.

04:10.520 --> 04:12.511
- Where is it now?
- We lost it.

04:12.680 --> 04:16.116
- What does Kryten think?
- Kryten's off moon-hopping with Rimmer.

04:16.320 --> 04:20.074
Radio link's down. I'll keep trying.

04:24.360 --> 04:29.195
So, what's the problem?
Hey, you OK? You look tense.

04:38.920 --> 04:42.151
You're playing that dumb adventure game.

04:49.280 --> 04:54.195
Then buy a potion from Gandalf,
the master wizard. That's what I usually do.

06:13.520 --> 06:16.717
Kryten, take it easy.
I'm gonna get you outta there.

06:17.800 --> 06:20.633
My legs, I can't feel them.

06:20.800 --> 06:22.950
Yeah, they're trapped under this stanchion.

06:23.120 --> 06:27.079
- I'm gonna have to cut you in two.
- Begging your pardon, sir?

06:28.120 --> 06:31.157
Kryten, keep still. I'm trying to draw a line.

06:31.320 --> 06:36.189
I don't want it going wonky.
We want to keep as much of you as possible.

06:44.760 --> 06:49.470
Sir, a couple of brief points. Firstly,
you are not a qualified service engineer

06:49.640 --> 06:54.111
and consequently sawing me in two
will invalidate my guarantee.

06:54.280 --> 06:58.956
Secondly, I wouldn't trust you to open
a can of sardines that was already open.

07:02.880 --> 07:06.031
Ooh! You're right! He really isn't dead!

07:06.200 --> 07:08.270
I owe you 20.

07:10.720 --> 07:13.439
- Kryten, you OK?
- I think so, sir.

07:13.600 --> 07:16.239
There's a few bits and bobs left over,

07:16.400 --> 07:19.597
but it's always the same when you try DIY.

07:19.800 --> 07:23.873
- Where's Mr Rimmer?
- We were just gonna ask you that.

07:24.040 --> 07:26.031
- What happened?
- There are gaps.

07:26.200 --> 07:32.230
Mr Rimmer spotted an S-3 planet on the scope
and wanted to claim it for the Space Corps.

07:32.400 --> 07:38.430
As usual, the ceremony consisted of singing
all 23 stanzas of the Space Corps anthem.

07:39.280 --> 07:44.274
Then the planet started to erupt around us,
which, frankly, came as a relief.

07:46.360 --> 07:48.078
- A moonquake?
- Worse.

07:48.240 --> 07:53.473
It was as if the entire planet was reshaping,
terraforming itself as we watched.

07:53.640 --> 07:55.710
- And then?
- Then things got sketchy.

07:55.880 --> 08:01.159
I remember an explosion and then blackness.
And then I remember Mr Rimmer screaming.

08:01.320 --> 08:04.790
I remember his face
twisted with fear, pain, anguish, dread...

08:04.960 --> 08:06.951
absolutely mortified.

08:07.160 --> 08:11.039
Did someone suggest
he pick up the tab for lunch?

08:12.120 --> 08:14.475
Something took him. Something awful.

08:14.680 --> 08:17.717
Can we get a trace on his light bee?

08:17.920 --> 08:20.832
Got him. Click and a half due south.

08:21.040 --> 08:25.431
Suggest we continue the journey by land, sir.
I'll lower the caterpillar tracks.

08:25.640 --> 08:30.156
I think I've just worked out
what that missing circuit board is for.

08:32.960 --> 08:36.270
This is one weird place.
Strange animal noises,

08:36.440 --> 08:39.716
unbearable stench, squelchy underfoot...

08:39.919 --> 08:42.480
It's just like your laundry basket.

08:43.159 --> 08:46.596
- Getting anything?
- My guess is this is a psi-moon.

08:46.800 --> 08:50.076
- Psi-moon?
- An artificial planetoid.

08:50.240 --> 08:54.950
It tunes into an individual psyche
and adapts to mimic his mental state.

08:55.160 --> 08:57.310
In this instance, it reconfigured itself

08:57.480 --> 09:00.074
using Mr Rimmer's subconscious as a template.

09:00.280 --> 09:05.115
- What are you saying to me, Kryten?
- We are interlopers inside Mr Rimmer's mind.

09:08.960 --> 09:12.589
This sounds like a 12-change-of-underwear trip.

09:12.880 --> 09:15.440
If this planet's Rimmer's mind, what took him?

09:15.640 --> 09:20.634
All his neuroses, all his personal demons
will be incarnated here, made flesh.

09:20.840 --> 09:23.991
- Example?
- Well, each person's mindscape is unique,

09:24.160 --> 09:30.269
but we could encounter, say, Mr Rimmer's lust
personified as some kind of slobbering beast.

09:30.480 --> 09:32.675
Rimmer's lust monster?

09:32.840 --> 09:34.956
Urrgh!

09:35.160 --> 09:38.755
Every individual's mental landscape
is dominated by one drive.

09:38.920 --> 09:43.869
In some cases, it might be ambition.
In others greed, envy, the desire to please.

09:44.040 --> 09:47.669
Whatever took Mr Rimmer,
let's pray that its intentions are benign.

09:47.880 --> 09:50.792
He can't be in much danger. He's a hologram.

09:51.000 --> 09:54.549
Not here. Here he has
a physical form until he leaves.

09:54.720 --> 09:58.474
Any danger he may be in will be very real indeed.

10:02.040 --> 10:07.319
Look, I don't know who you are,
but I demand my right to a phone call.

10:09.240 --> 10:14.519
Yes, I thought the threat of legal action
would have you running for cover.

10:14.720 --> 10:20.272
Look, I'm trying to keep my temper, but you
really are pushing your luck, miladdikins.

10:22.880 --> 10:27.351
Is this the British embassy?
Does it look remotely like the embassy?

10:27.520 --> 10:30.637
I want to know who you are now.

10:30.800 --> 10:34.952
In accordance
with the appetites of the Dark One,

10:35.120 --> 10:37.918
we, the hooded legions,
proffer up this sacrifice

10:38.120 --> 10:41.635
to slake the vile depraved thirstings
of the Unspeakable One.

10:41.800 --> 10:44.439
Well, that's cleared that up.

10:47.400 --> 10:49.868
Oh! Thank God. Thank God.

10:50.080 --> 10:52.958
There were some strange men in black hoods

10:53.120 --> 10:56.112
with drums and rather unconvincing red eyes.

10:56.280 --> 11:00.034
Thank God you're here.
I thought I was in danger.

11:03.920 --> 11:08.038
Is it me or has it suddenly got
rather hot in here?

11:09.120 --> 11:13.716
- Why have we stopped?
- I don't think that swamp will support us.

11:13.880 --> 11:17.589
- I suggest we continue the journey on foot.
- Go out there?

11:17.760 --> 11:20.991
- Into Rimmer's subconscious?
- We're almost on top of him.

11:21.160 --> 11:26.109
- Just a few hundred metres.
- Remember, it's Rimmer's mind out there.

11:27.240 --> 11:29.595
Expect sickness.

11:30.720 --> 11:35.475
I'm a second technician in the Space Corps,
briefed to give name and number only.

11:35.680 --> 11:41.676
I don't know what you people are playing at,
but I won't give you anything else.

11:41.840 --> 11:48.279
You can oil me all you like, you can use your
tongues to caress my erogenous zones

11:48.440 --> 11:51.238
onto a plateau of sexual ecstasy.

11:51.400 --> 11:55.279
But I'll tell you now -
this nut's not for cracking.

11:57.920 --> 12:01.515
However, far be it from me
to change your plan.

12:01.680 --> 12:07.596
If you insist on using erotic persuasion
to achieve your devious ends, then so be it.

12:08.200 --> 12:11.875
Just have a large pizza
with extra olives ready afterwards.

12:15.680 --> 12:18.240
Er, where are you going?

12:18.480 --> 12:20.277
Er, what are you doing?

12:20.480 --> 12:22.675
My God! Are you taking a flying leap?!

12:22.880 --> 12:26.395
- We are going to summon the Master.
- The Master?

12:26.600 --> 12:29.068
You have been prepared for him.

12:29.280 --> 12:33.671
This Master character - and I acknowledge
that I may not want to know this -

12:33.840 --> 12:36.274
why does he want me oily particularly?

12:36.440 --> 12:40.956
Obviously, whatever he has in mind is
facilitated by my being slippery and pliant.

12:42.280 --> 12:48.992
He always likes his victims to be oiled.
It's much better for conducting electricity.

12:49.800 --> 12:52.109
Not the best news, but could've been worse.

13:20.680 --> 13:24.912
Why I agreed to strolling
around Rimmer's psyche I will never know.

13:25.080 --> 13:28.072
Oh, terrific. This gets better and better.

13:30.000 --> 13:33.117
Is it me or are those frogs saying "useless"?

13:35.800 --> 13:41.557
Hey, look at this. You've got a huge great
blood-sucking leech on your neck.

13:41.720 --> 13:43.790
It's got a human face.

13:43.960 --> 13:46.190
It's Rimmer's mum!

13:46.400 --> 13:48.675
Come quickly. I've found a metaphor.

13:48.840 --> 13:51.229
- A what?
- Look at all these gravestones.

13:51.440 --> 13:54.273
"Here lies self-respect, died aged 24."

13:54.480 --> 13:57.358
They're aspects of Rimmer's personality
which are dead.

14:06.040 --> 14:10.352
"Honour - gone but not forgotten,
died aged 12."

14:10.560 --> 14:12.869
Look at this. This one's minute!

14:16.360 --> 14:18.999
- This one's freshly dug.
- Who's it for?

14:20.840 --> 14:25.436
Oh, psychologically speaking, Mr Rimmer may
be in bigger trouble than we suspected.

14:25.600 --> 14:30.151
If this grave gets filled,
we may never get out of this nightmare.

14:43.280 --> 14:46.716
Boy, am I glad to see you.

14:46.920 --> 14:50.071
You must be the Unspeakable One.

14:50.840 --> 14:55.436
Just to fill you in - there's been
a gigantic administrative cock-up.

14:55.600 --> 14:58.956
Your staff have somehow
mistaken me for a virgin.

14:59.160 --> 15:05.508
Stop your putrid whining,
you dank tuft of rectal pubic hair!

15:06.240 --> 15:10.153
Sorry. I tend to jabber on a bit when I'm nervous.

15:12.800 --> 15:15.360
I've never been partial to physical torture.

15:15.520 --> 15:21.356
It's actually always been one of my...
worst nightmares, actually.

15:21.560 --> 15:28.557
Now all your nightmares
will come true here. All of them!

15:28.760 --> 15:31.638
He's got to be nearby. We're right on top of him.

15:35.840 --> 15:38.593
Whatever that was, let's hope it's had lunch.

15:38.760 --> 15:41.399
- It's below us.
- Who are you?

15:41.560 --> 15:44.757
- Here.
- Why are you being so horrible?

15:44.960 --> 15:50.830
It is you who created me,
nurtured me, helped me grow strong.

15:51.040 --> 15:54.555
I am the part of you that hates yourself.

15:54.720 --> 15:57.757
I am your self-loathing.

15:57.920 --> 16:03.278
- My self-loathing?
- Is it not true that you despise yourself?

16:03.440 --> 16:07.319
That you detest
your own incompetence and stupidity?

16:07.480 --> 16:12.031
That you hold yourself in contempt for your
countless failures and disappointments?

16:12.240 --> 16:17.109
Is it not true that you feel nothing
but the deepest, blackest rancour

16:17.280 --> 16:22.229
for that walking vomit stain
the world calls Arnold Rimmer?

16:22.400 --> 16:24.436
Is it not true?

16:24.600 --> 16:26.591
Yes.

16:26.960 --> 16:28.951
Look, we've got two choices.

16:29.120 --> 16:33.272
Either we go in, bazookoids blazing,
and get him out of there

16:33.440 --> 16:36.193
or sit like lemons
and watch him get tortured.

16:36.360 --> 16:38.794
Anybody got any opera glasses?

16:38.960 --> 16:42.157
Set bazookoids to kill, stuff and mount.

16:42.320 --> 16:44.436
We're going in. Kryten?

16:59.480 --> 17:02.278
Is it my turn now?

17:02.440 --> 17:07.069
- Reload!
- The bazookoid fire could start a rockslide.

17:07.280 --> 17:09.839
- Reload.
- You'd risk your lives for me?

17:10.040 --> 17:12.634
Of course. You're part of the crew.

17:17.839 --> 17:19.319
What happened?

17:19.480 --> 17:21.675
- Weird!
- Where'd he go?

17:21.839 --> 17:25.435
There's an old android saying
which is peculiarly appropriate here.

17:25.640 --> 17:27.631
In binary language, it's this -

17:27.800 --> 17:31.634
0-0-1-1-0-0-1-1
1-0-1-1-0-0-0-1-1-1-1-0-0,

17:31.800 --> 17:35.110
1-1-1-1-1-0-0-0-1-1-1-0-0-0-1-1-1-1,

17:35.280 --> 17:40.559
which roughly translated means, "Don't stand
around jabbering when you're in danger. "

17:45.160 --> 17:48.630
- Which way?
- Right at the Swamp of Despair,

17:48.800 --> 17:53.430
straight past the Wood of Humiliation,
then left at the Chasm of Hopelessness.

17:53.600 --> 17:56.478
You're a weird guy, you know that?

18:07.880 --> 18:11.634
Why are you all looking at me like it's my fault?

18:11.840 --> 18:17.597
Have you any idea what kind of day I've had?
I've been kidnapped, stripped, oiled,

18:17.760 --> 18:22.038
menaced, manacled, licked,
nibbled, chained, tortured, humiliated,

18:22.240 --> 18:29.351
and I nearly had a thing shaped like a cactus
jammed where only customs men dare to probe.

18:29.560 --> 18:33.838
- Don't you know what this place is?
- Yes, it's a hell-hole, a nightmare.

18:34.000 --> 18:36.798
It's a stinking infested pit of putridness.

18:37.000 --> 18:38.911
Rimmer, it's your mind.

18:39.880 --> 18:42.030
He's right, sir. This is a psi-moon.

18:42.200 --> 18:44.714
Its terrain was landscaped by your psyche.

18:44.920 --> 18:48.117
So... So what are you saying to me?

18:48.280 --> 18:52.239
That thing, that beast...
that lives inside my mind?

18:52.440 --> 18:55.432
- Metaphorically, yes, sir.
- Self-loathing?

18:55.600 --> 18:59.639
I don't loathe myself.
What is there to loathe about me?

18:59.840 --> 19:02.479
Would you like the list, sir?

19:02.680 --> 19:05.752
- What list?
- Well, you were despised by your parents

19:05.920 --> 19:08.150
for failing to achieve their standards.

19:08.320 --> 19:13.758
Your brothers were high-flyers in the Space
Corps and you serviced chicken soup machines.

19:13.960 --> 19:18.033
There's your inability to form long-term
relationships with anyone, your cowardliness,

19:18.200 --> 19:20.475
your lack of charm, honour or grace

19:20.640 --> 19:24.155
and the awful knowledge
that no one has truly liked you

19:24.320 --> 19:26.436
because you are so fundamentally unlikeable.

19:28.160 --> 19:29.639
Oh, that.

19:29.840 --> 19:33.196
Please don't interrupt, sir.
I'm only halfway through.

19:33.360 --> 19:37.273
- Now, where was I?
- I think he's got the point.

19:37.440 --> 19:40.512
God! I'm such a mess.

19:40.720 --> 19:42.915
What was that?

19:43.120 --> 19:45.998
- Quicksand's sucking us down.
- Hit the retros!

19:46.200 --> 19:49.636
They're only keeping us stable.
Ten minutes before they burn out.

19:49.840 --> 19:54.914
OK. Let's get into the jet-powered rocket pants
and birdman the hell out of here.

19:55.080 --> 19:59.232
An excellent and inventive suggestion, sir,
with just two tiny drawbacks -

19:59.440 --> 20:03.194
we don't have
any jet-powered rocket pants,

20:03.360 --> 20:07.069
and there's no such thing
as jet-powered rocket pants

20:07.240 --> 20:10.949
outside the fictional serial
"Robbie Rocket Pants".

20:11.160 --> 20:15.358
Well, that's put a crimp
on an otherwise damn fine plan.

20:15.560 --> 20:17.596
Hang on. I'm getting an energy emission.

20:18.560 --> 20:23.076
Hand over the worm
and your lives will be spared.

20:23.240 --> 20:25.629
My quarrel is not with you.

20:25.800 --> 20:29.839
It's with that excremental smear
who cowers amongst you.

20:30.000 --> 20:32.070
If you attempt to shield him,

20:32.240 --> 20:37.189
then I shall unleash the full terrible fury
of my hooded hordes against you.

20:37.360 --> 20:39.590
You have ten minutes.

20:39.760 --> 20:42.797
- Where are you going?
- Where do you think?

20:42.960 --> 20:47.033
You heard him. If I don't hand myself over,
he'll attack Starbug.

20:47.240 --> 20:52.633
- What? You're giving yourself up?
- No. I'm going to the engine room to cower.

20:52.800 --> 20:56.031
I suggest you find ingenious places
to tremble, too.

20:56.240 --> 21:01.075
The only way we're gonna get out of here
alive is by killing that thing.

21:01.280 --> 21:05.193
- How? It's invulnerable.
- We're finished.

21:09.720 --> 21:12.234
Increase retros to max. Now stable.

21:12.440 --> 21:14.476
Wait a minute...

21:16.080 --> 21:22.155
This is all your fault, you know,
you little glob of tuberculotic sputum.

21:23.960 --> 21:25.552
Ah, interesting.

21:26.680 --> 21:32.994
Sir, you are a cruddy little scudball
with all the lovability of an itchy verruca.

21:33.200 --> 21:35.589
Excellent.

21:35.760 --> 21:39.719
Mr Lister, Cat, confabulation in the cockpit.

21:39.920 --> 21:42.957
Not you, sir.

21:44.400 --> 21:49.315
Sirs, I think I have it.
The real enemy is not out there.

21:49.480 --> 21:52.517
The real enemy is inside Mr Rimmer's head.

21:52.720 --> 21:56.759
Nice plan. So we remove his head
and everything's cool, right?

21:56.960 --> 22:01.033
No, wait a minute.
That's gone right up my flagpole, Kryten.

22:01.200 --> 22:03.191
- I'm saluting that one.
- What?

22:03.400 --> 22:08.713
When we drove back the beast in the cavern,
it wasn't bazookoid fire that did it.

22:08.880 --> 22:11.633
- It was telling Rimmer we'd save him.
- Precisely.

22:11.840 --> 22:14.752
So if we make Rimmer feel cared about...

22:14.960 --> 22:20.034
If we can make him feel good about himself,
somehow restore his self-esteem and pride,

22:20.200 --> 22:22.839
that would vanquish the self-loathing beast,

22:23.000 --> 22:28.028
or at least debilitate it long enough
for us to get off this psi-moon.

22:28.240 --> 22:32.711
How do we make him feel good?
What is there to feel good about?

22:32.920 --> 22:36.196
- We've got to tell him we love him.
- You're sick!

22:36.400 --> 22:40.757
- I want no part of this depravity.
- He must not suspect we are insincere.

22:40.920 --> 22:43.718
Our lives depend on it. Ready?

22:43.880 --> 22:45.677
I'll never be ready.

22:52.760 --> 22:57.038
Listen, we've decided to stay with you
and face the danger.

22:57.200 --> 22:59.270
- All for one and that.
- Really?

22:59.480 --> 23:04.395
Sir, I'd just like to say
that you are a very beautiful person.

23:05.560 --> 23:07.835
He means we're all facing certain death

23:08.000 --> 23:11.549
and we should let each other know
how we feel about each other.

23:11.760 --> 23:16.675
- You think that's a good idea?
- Guys aren't terrific at, you know...

23:16.840 --> 23:20.753
- Expressing their feelings.
- Yeah. They kid around, insult each other.

23:20.920 --> 23:24.993
And what they really mean is...
They can't say what they really mean.

23:25.200 --> 23:29.830
- What are you trying to tell me?
- I'm just saying that whatever happens,

23:30.000 --> 23:33.549
I want you to know I really care about you.

23:37.400 --> 23:39.709
We all do, sir.

23:41.800 --> 23:45.759
It's true. They really do care about you.

23:45.960 --> 23:50.954
Only this morning you called me
a cancerous polyp on the anus of humanity.

23:51.160 --> 23:53.310
In an affectionate way.

23:53.480 --> 23:56.119
In a kidding around, friendly, affectionate way.

23:56.320 --> 24:00.472
Sir, we may never get another opportunity
to articulate our feelings,

24:00.640 --> 24:05.350
and I would like to take this opportunity
to say that you're a splendid man,

24:05.520 --> 24:09.752
a much-respected colleague
and a, goshdarn it, damn good friend!

24:11.600 --> 24:14.558
- We're getting some lift.
- Wait a minute.

24:14.720 --> 24:17.473
- I know why you're doing this.
- Going down.

24:17.640 --> 24:23.476
You're trying to make me feel guilty,
to shame me into doing the honourable thing.

24:26.680 --> 24:29.035
- Why, then?
- Our number's up here.

24:29.200 --> 24:31.919
I want to set the record straight.

24:32.080 --> 24:37.108
It's not easy saying this one man to another,
but... I love you, man.

24:37.280 --> 24:39.271
I really, really love you.

24:40.280 --> 24:43.272
- Going up.
- It might be a good idea

24:43.640 --> 24:47.758
if we try and get
into a kind of a four-way hug situation.

24:47.920 --> 24:52.357
- What's wrong with you?
- People don't touch enough, sir.

24:52.520 --> 24:55.034
I love you, Arnie. This is a beautiful man.

24:55.200 --> 24:58.875
- This is a beautiful moment.
- We love you, AJ!

24:59.080 --> 25:02.117
Get in the cockpit.
There's something very strange happening.

25:13.080 --> 25:17.835
Charge, my hordes of darkness.
Bring me the head of the Despicable One.

25:25.960 --> 25:27.951
Have at you, Bitterness!

25:28.640 --> 25:30.631
Take that, Self-Doubt!

25:34.600 --> 25:38.070
Die like the dog you are, Mistrust!

25:38.280 --> 25:42.717
Feel my blade, Loneliness.
May your foulness rot in hell.

25:43.280 --> 25:45.271
We're getting some lift.

25:48.160 --> 25:50.390
20 metres, that's enough for lift-off.

25:50.640 --> 25:52.631
We're almost clear.

25:58.440 --> 26:01.193
- It was all baloney, wasn't it?
- What was?

26:01.400 --> 26:04.949
All that hugging stuff.
It was just a way of escaping.

26:05.120 --> 26:11.070
You didn't really feel that I'm an OK bloke,
that I'm not so bad once you know me.

26:11.240 --> 26:13.913
You didn't mean any of that, did you?

26:14.440 --> 26:16.476
No.

26:20.160 --> 26:23.232
# It's cold outside,
there's no kind of atmosphere

26:23.400 --> 26:26.710
# I'm all alone, more or less

26:26.880 --> 26:29.997
# Let me fly far away from here

26:30.160 --> 26:32.879
# Fun, fun, fun

26:33.040 --> 26:36.669
# In the sun, sun, sun

26:36.840 --> 26:40.071
# I want to lie, shipwrecked and comatose

26:40.240 --> 26:43.471
# Drinking fresh mango juice

26:43.640 --> 26:46.791
# Goldfish shoals, nibbling at my toes

26:46.960 --> 26:49.679
# Fun, fun, fun

26:49.840 --> 26:53.515
# In the sun, sun, sun

26:53.680 --> 26:56.353
# Fun, fun, fun

26:56.520 --> 27:00.672
# In the sun, sun, sun #

27:01.305 --> 27:07.403
