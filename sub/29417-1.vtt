04:11.035 --> 04:12.409
- Let's go, right now.
- Yeah?

04:12.411 --> 04:13.659
- Right here, let's go.
- You want that?

04:13.661 --> 04:14.744
- Right here.
- Hey.

04:14.746 --> 04:15.661
- Let's do it right now.
- Hey, hey.

04:15.663 --> 04:17.039
I'm tired of this.

04:17.041 --> 04:18.875
Calderon, on the line.

04:30.303 --> 04:31.594
Come on, get up, Frank.

04:38.144 --> 04:39.394
Who's next, huh?

04:39.396 --> 04:41.313
Let's go, I can take
any one of you on.

04:41.315 --> 04:42.606
Tell 'em, Dad.

04:42.608 --> 04:45.192
I could beat every one
of these kids in here.

04:45.194 --> 04:46.693
You tell 'em, come on.

04:46.695 --> 04:48.779
I'd beat 'em...

04:48.781 --> 04:50.572
Why do you always have
to do that to me, Dad?

04:50.574 --> 04:51.742
It's not fair.

04:52.950 --> 04:56.077
Life may not always be
what you want it to be.

04:56.079 --> 04:58.746
Sometimes you gotta dig deep.

04:58.748 --> 05:01.500
Deeper than you ever did before.

05:01.502 --> 05:04.463
You reach inside
and you let it go.

05:13.389 --> 05:14.223
Get up.

05:24.315 --> 05:27.359
Yeah I mean, ever since your
mother died, it's just been...

05:27.361 --> 05:29.236
Dad, you don't even.

05:29.238 --> 05:31.320
You don't have to go there.

05:31.322 --> 05:32.738
Whenever you're down,
you're always welcome here.

05:32.740 --> 05:34.700
Seriously, Dad, anytime.

05:34.702 --> 05:38.745
We love when you're
here and so do the boys.

05:45.878 --> 05:46.879
Thank you.

05:51.676 --> 05:53.135
Uncle
Steve, Uncle Steve,

05:53.137 --> 05:54.719
come check this out.

05:58.349 --> 06:00.017
- Sound familiar?
- Good kid.

06:00.019 --> 06:01.560
What, who, me?

06:01.562 --> 06:03.854
Yeah, always trying
to get my attention

06:03.856 --> 06:06.106
to play with you
and your friends.

06:06.108 --> 06:08.190
Those were good times, Steve.

06:08.192 --> 06:09.818
Yeah, Joey, they were.

06:09.820 --> 06:10.736
Definitely.

06:10.738 --> 06:12.445
Now they didn't have to change

06:12.447 --> 06:15.366
until you decided
to just take off.

06:19.872 --> 06:21.665
I'll be right back.

06:27.546 --> 06:30.046
Dad, why do you have
to keep digging at him?

06:30.048 --> 06:32.214
'Cause he's too reckless.

06:32.216 --> 06:35.385
What is he gonna do one day
when his luck runs out, huh?

06:35.387 --> 06:36.803
What's gonna happen then?

06:36.805 --> 06:40.059
You can't change
who someone is, Dad.

06:42.310 --> 06:43.392
Forget it.

06:43.394 --> 06:45.186
So what's up with work?

06:45.188 --> 06:48.272
Well, those two guys I told
you about who were murdered

06:48.274 --> 06:50.900
looked like they had
been through a war zone.

06:50.902 --> 06:53.820
Had lacerations, contusions
on their bodies and facies.

06:53.822 --> 06:54.988
Knife wounds?

06:54.990 --> 06:56.238
No.

06:56.240 --> 06:59.745
More like full contact
fighting without gloves.

07:01.579 --> 07:03.664
What does the brass say?

07:03.666 --> 07:07.416
What else, Dad, they want
it done quickly and quietly.

07:07.418 --> 07:10.212
What is else is new, God.

07:10.214 --> 07:11.798
Doesn't sound good.

07:15.094 --> 07:16.426
Who's running tactical?

07:16.428 --> 07:18.260
Uncle Frank, I hope.

07:18.262 --> 07:19.762
Of course he is.

07:19.764 --> 07:23.058
Who do you think put me
in touch with the A-team?

07:23.060 --> 07:24.558
I still don't like it.

07:24.560 --> 07:27.354
Why don't they get someone
else to run undercover?

07:27.356 --> 07:29.274
Joey, you got a family.

07:30.692 --> 07:32.274
Dad, look, anyone
else would blow

07:32.276 --> 07:34.318
their cover at the
first sign of a problem.

07:34.320 --> 07:37.863
They chose me because
of my experience.

07:37.865 --> 07:39.282
All right.

07:39.284 --> 07:42.368
You just keep me in the loop.

07:42.370 --> 07:43.204
Promise?

07:44.163 --> 07:45.416
Promise, Dad.

07:56.635 --> 08:01.557
All right, we got a snitch
who's been feeding us intel.

08:02.974 --> 08:04.433
You're gonna make your
way into this organization

08:04.435 --> 08:08.310
and establish yourself as a
fighter who's down on his luck,

08:08.312 --> 08:10.731
looking to fight,
make some money

08:10.733 --> 08:13.315
and looking to pay
off gambling debts.

08:13.317 --> 08:15.818
They need to think they own you.

08:15.820 --> 08:17.529
Maybe I should
just bet on myself.

08:19.158 --> 08:21.991
Concentrate, smart ass.

08:21.993 --> 08:23.827
This is serious business.

08:23.829 --> 08:25.536
Don't screw this up.

08:25.538 --> 08:26.998
I know, I know.

08:28.082 --> 08:30.334
Look, you guys chose me.

08:30.336 --> 08:32.880
We're gonna get these bastards.

08:38.844 --> 08:39.677
Thank you.

09:25.391 --> 09:26.433
- Hey.
- Shit.

09:27.892 --> 09:29.351
What you nervous
about something?

09:29.353 --> 09:30.894
Don't do that to me.

09:30.896 --> 09:32.395
Do what?

09:32.397 --> 09:33.646
Do what, Arny?

09:33.648 --> 09:35.148
Nothing.

09:35.150 --> 09:37.233
Look, maybe you guys could
be a little nicer to me,

09:37.235 --> 09:38.776
since I'm doing this for you.

09:38.778 --> 09:41.237
Oh you think we
owe you something?

09:41.239 --> 09:42.489
From my recollection,

09:42.491 --> 09:44.031
you're the one who got
busted with those drugs.

09:44.033 --> 09:45.951
That's why you're here
ratting on your friends.

09:45.953 --> 09:47.454
Okay, goddammit.

09:49.080 --> 09:50.579
You used to be a lot nicer.

09:50.581 --> 09:54.000
I think this undercover
thing is going to your head.

09:54.002 --> 09:55.584
All right, that's enough.

09:55.586 --> 09:57.254
Where's Vincent?

09:57.256 --> 10:01.717
Well, we have to drive to
him and I don't have a car.

10:01.719 --> 10:03.718
I got a fuckin' car.

10:03.720 --> 10:04.554
Let's go.

10:06.223 --> 10:07.056
Let's go.

10:08.517 --> 10:09.725
Take me there.

10:09.727 --> 10:12.146
Hope it's
not a cop car.

10:24.950 --> 10:26.283
So why don't we
bring the guys here

10:26.285 --> 10:27.534
tomorrow around four o'clock?

10:27.536 --> 10:29.037
Yeah, it's open.

10:34.042 --> 10:35.168
Hey, Vinnie.

10:45.304 --> 10:47.139
Hey, look who it is.

10:48.098 --> 10:49.058
Here I am.

10:49.974 --> 10:50.973
Who's he?

10:50.975 --> 10:51.975
- This is...
- I'm Johnny...

10:51.977 --> 10:54.605
Yeah, I wasn't talking to you.

10:57.608 --> 10:58.441
Arny?

11:00.151 --> 11:01.735
This is Johnny Siglioni,

11:01.737 --> 11:04.573
he's the fighter
I told you about.

11:06.575 --> 11:08.491
Arny says you can fight.

11:08.493 --> 11:10.952
Yeah, that's right.

11:10.954 --> 11:12.913
What's your story?

11:12.915 --> 11:14.164
You know, like anybody.

11:14.166 --> 11:16.832
Just fell on a little debt.

11:16.834 --> 11:19.336
Need to get back on my feet,
you know what I'm sayin'?

11:19.338 --> 11:20.171
Sure.

11:23.508 --> 11:25.509
You don't look too special.

11:25.511 --> 11:26.635
So maybe I put you out there,

11:26.637 --> 11:28.970
you show me what you got, yeah?

11:28.972 --> 11:31.183
Yeah, won't let you down.

11:32.600 --> 11:35.101
- All right.
- Okay, thanks, man.

11:35.103 --> 11:37.062
- All right.
- Appreciate it.

11:37.064 --> 11:38.730
- You got it.
- Thanks, Vinnie.

11:38.732 --> 11:39.565
Yeah.

11:40.943 --> 11:42.358
Now next month.

11:42.360 --> 11:44.361
Woo hoo, Johnny boy.

11:44.363 --> 11:45.319
'Atta boy.

11:45.321 --> 11:46.698
Did you see that?

11:50.576 --> 11:52.202
I told you he was pretty good.

11:52.204 --> 11:53.372
Relax, relax.

11:58.960 --> 12:02.169
Play that funky
music, white boy.

12:02.171 --> 12:03.922
Put your money on Johnny.

12:03.924 --> 12:05.966
Put your money on
Johnny, everybody.

12:05.968 --> 12:08.467
- White tiger, white tiger!
- Arny!

12:08.469 --> 12:10.761
He's the king.

12:12.932 --> 12:16.393
I want finders.

12:28.741 --> 12:30.406
Come on!

13:14.619 --> 13:17.621
Hey, watch
out for that one.

13:17.623 --> 13:19.081
What, who?

13:19.083 --> 13:20.374
Vincent's lapdog.

13:20.376 --> 13:21.792
He doesn't trust you.

13:25.464 --> 13:27.630
Do I know you?

13:27.632 --> 13:30.592
Just some friendly advice.

13:30.594 --> 13:32.135
We ain't friends.

14:19.685 --> 14:20.853
Hey.

14:22.228 --> 14:24.730
Jesus Christ, Steve,
you wanna get shot?

14:24.732 --> 14:26.148
You gonna shoot
me, little brother?

14:27.443 --> 14:28.567
They're sleeping.

14:28.569 --> 14:30.568
Sorry about that, but hey uh,

14:30.570 --> 14:32.194
what the hell is goin' on here?

14:32.196 --> 14:34.239
Dressed like this, smoking.

14:34.241 --> 14:35.075
Come on.

14:36.535 --> 14:39.452
It's just undercover
work, all right?

14:39.454 --> 14:41.078
Are you crazy?

14:41.080 --> 14:42.914
Fighters are turning up dead.

14:42.916 --> 14:44.832
It's all part of the syndicate.

14:44.834 --> 14:47.046
Not the Rouha Syndicate?

14:49.339 --> 14:52.381
Look, gambling was one thing.

14:52.383 --> 14:53.632
Now it's murder.

14:53.634 --> 14:54.842
You can't do this.

14:54.844 --> 14:56.595
These guys are no joke.

14:56.597 --> 14:58.138
Look, I got dad
breathing down my neck.

14:58.140 --> 14:59.847
I don't need you doin'
it too, all right?

14:59.849 --> 15:02.183
Hey, I've had dad breathing
down my neck my whole life.

15:02.185 --> 15:03.019
I get it.

15:04.188 --> 15:06.228
But come on, even
after mom died.

15:06.230 --> 15:08.398
You know he was
no piece of cake.

15:08.400 --> 15:09.901
But Joey, I can't.

15:12.488 --> 15:13.904
I can't let you do this.

15:13.906 --> 15:16.405
Look, we got it covered okay?

15:16.407 --> 15:18.074
It's good, it's good.

15:18.076 --> 15:19.577
You wanna come in?

15:27.585 --> 15:29.919
Hey, Vincent, you
wanted to talk?

15:29.921 --> 15:30.755
Johnny.

15:31.924 --> 15:33.923
New kid on the block.

15:33.925 --> 15:35.426
Yeah, that's me.

15:37.387 --> 15:39.763
Hey listen, if you don't mind
I just wanted to warm up.

15:39.765 --> 15:41.097
So if we could make this quick?

15:41.099 --> 15:43.475
Yeah, I won't hold
you up, you know.

15:43.477 --> 15:46.313
Hey, last few
fights, pretty good.

15:47.189 --> 15:49.146
Appreciate that.

15:49.148 --> 15:52.733
This one, you're going
down in the second.

15:52.735 --> 15:54.986
I'm not losing to no one.

15:54.988 --> 15:57.114
I'm not asking.

15:57.116 --> 15:59.448
You fuck me on
this, you're done.

15:59.450 --> 16:00.284
You got it?

16:01.494 --> 16:02.829
- Yeah.
- Say it.

16:04.706 --> 16:08.125
I'm going down in the second.

16:08.127 --> 16:09.795
Make it look real.

16:11.504 --> 16:12.837
Yeah.

16:12.839 --> 16:13.673
Hey.

16:17.552 --> 16:18.803
Now you can go.

16:36.613 --> 16:38.362
We got a problem.

16:38.364 --> 16:39.614
What's up?

16:39.616 --> 16:42.536
Your man right
there, he's a cop.

16:46.665 --> 16:50.169
Johnny?

16:51.878 --> 16:53.086
I'm gonna make a
fortune with this kid.

16:53.088 --> 16:54.462
I'm telling you.

16:54.464 --> 16:57.508
That junkie Arny
may have set you up.

16:58.719 --> 17:01.135
- You sure?
- I'm sure that guy's a cop.

17:01.137 --> 17:03.263
My guy is dispatch filled me in.

17:03.265 --> 17:05.517
As for Arny, I'll find out.

17:18.946 --> 17:19.780
I'll take care of it, all right?

17:19.781 --> 17:20.782
Don't worry.

17:35.588 --> 17:37.715
Johnny, come here, kid.

17:39.884 --> 17:42.343
Hey, hey, you were great.

17:42.345 --> 17:43.719
Unbelievable.

17:43.721 --> 17:45.304
Don't worry about any
of this, all right?

17:45.306 --> 17:47.431
There's plenty more
where that came from.

17:47.433 --> 17:50.811
I want you to get
cleaned up, all right?

17:50.813 --> 17:53.854
Come downstairs and I wanna
talk about your future.

17:53.856 --> 17:55.273
Yeah.

17:55.275 --> 17:57.234
- All right?
- All right, sure.

17:57.236 --> 17:59.613
It's your future.

18:05.619 --> 18:08.245
What have you got in mind?

18:08.247 --> 18:11.540
You'll see, come on.

18:14.753 --> 18:16.003
Get him over there.

18:16.005 --> 18:18.755
- You're fuckin' piece of...
- Come on.

18:18.757 --> 18:20.424
- Piece of shit.
- Use your fuckin' feet.

18:20.426 --> 18:21.260
Come on.

18:25.264 --> 18:27.723
Grips, put him over there.

18:31.603 --> 18:33.269
Push him down.

18:33.271 --> 18:36.441
This is what happens
when you fuck me.

18:47.244 --> 18:49.076
Come on.

20:28.094 --> 20:31.431
Hey, what are you
doing here so early?

20:32.473 --> 20:33.975
We need to talk.

20:35.436 --> 20:36.270
Yeah.

20:39.314 --> 20:40.730
What is it?

20:40.732 --> 20:44.110
I know you 30 years,
what's on your mind?

20:45.069 --> 20:46.570
What is it, I can handle it.

20:46.572 --> 20:48.947
Has my son Steve gotten
himself into trouble again?

20:48.949 --> 20:49.908
Not Steve.

20:50.909 --> 20:51.744
It's Joey.

20:54.203 --> 20:56.331
We found him this morning.

20:57.999 --> 21:00.374
What do you mean found him?

21:00.376 --> 21:01.210
Mike.

21:10.888 --> 21:13.054
What the hell happened?

21:13.056 --> 21:16.642
His position was
compromised or given up.

21:17.769 --> 21:19.270
We don't know yet.

21:20.814 --> 21:22.149
I'm sorry, Mike.

21:22.982 --> 21:24.858
I'm so sorry.

21:24.860 --> 21:28.530
I promise you, I will
find out who did this.

21:30.239 --> 21:33.076
You know Joey was
like my brother.

21:38.665 --> 21:40.458
Do you need anything?

21:45.631 --> 21:46.465
No.

22:08.653 --> 22:10.738
I'll be in touch, Mike.

22:16.161 --> 22:16.996
I'm sorry.

22:23.960 --> 22:24.795
Dad!

22:27.046 --> 22:28.548
Dad, what's wrong?

22:31.509 --> 22:32.344
Dad.

22:33.804 --> 22:35.639
Your brother's dead.

22:40.227 --> 22:42.393
What happened?

22:42.395 --> 22:43.894
I don't know.

22:43.896 --> 22:46.065
He was working undercover.

22:48.110 --> 22:48.944
I know.

22:53.907 --> 22:54.825
You knew?

24:03.768 --> 24:04.603
Dad.

24:08.940 --> 24:11.110
I'm going over to Stacy's.

24:20.201 --> 24:21.036
Okay.

24:22.453 --> 24:24.789
I'll be back in a few hours.

25:07.458 --> 25:09.666
Joseph was not only

25:09.668 --> 25:12.588
a dedicated servant
for his people,

25:14.340 --> 25:16.925
but a dedicated servant to God.

25:18.344 --> 25:22.347
A loving husband to his
wife, father to his children

25:23.766 --> 25:26.852
and a friend to
everyone who he knew.

25:28.562 --> 25:31.231
And in that love and compassion,

25:32.690 --> 25:37.071
Joseph sacrificed his life so
that others may live safely.

25:41.200 --> 25:43.869
Brother Joseph, we pray for you.

25:44.995 --> 25:47.998
Now that you reside
in God's kingdom

25:49.208 --> 25:51.709
and are eternally by his side.

25:52.835 --> 25:53.671
Amen.

26:06.266 --> 26:08.891
It never gets easier, Mike.

26:08.893 --> 26:10.520
You taught me that.

26:11.563 --> 26:13.857
And now we're burying Joey.

26:14.941 --> 26:17.609
We need to stop these
sons of bitches.

26:17.611 --> 26:19.361
What can you tell
me about my boy?

26:19.363 --> 26:22.238
These things take time.

26:22.240 --> 26:26.618
But know this, whatever needs
to be done is being done.

26:26.620 --> 26:31.625
Every rock turned over, I'm
gonna shake up every dirt bag.

26:32.500 --> 26:34.420
We'll get these guys, I promise.

26:35.754 --> 26:38.130
But off the record, they
already sent a unit to pickup

26:38.132 --> 26:42.092
that scum bag, Arny Simms,
who was Joey's way in.

26:42.094 --> 26:43.261
So hold tight.

27:16.003 --> 27:18.128
I've been thinkin',
maybe Joey shouldn't

27:18.130 --> 27:20.546
have been there in
the first place.

27:20.548 --> 27:24.592
You know, that's what gets
you into trouble, thinkin'.

27:24.594 --> 27:25.843
Thinkin', thinkin', thinkin',

27:25.845 --> 27:28.846
that's what always has
got you into trouble.

27:28.848 --> 27:30.515
What's that supposed to mean?

27:30.517 --> 27:32.892
- Nothing.
- No, tell me!

27:32.894 --> 27:34.602
I think you know exactly what
it's supposed to mean, okay?

27:34.604 --> 27:36.646
You've been a lot of
work, a lot of trouble,

27:36.648 --> 27:38.314
ever since you've
been a little kid.

27:38.316 --> 27:39.940
Dad.

27:39.942 --> 27:42.110
And then as much as
you don't like Harris,

27:42.112 --> 27:43.861
you are damn lucky
that he found you

27:43.863 --> 27:46.573
instead of one of
those other cops.

27:46.575 --> 27:48.074
That was a long time ago

27:48.076 --> 27:49.700
and you don't know
the half of it.

27:49.702 --> 27:50.660
I don't know the half of it?

27:50.662 --> 27:51.911
I know that you beat the shit

27:51.913 --> 27:55.247
out of the Chief of
Police's kid, okay?

27:55.249 --> 27:58.543
That was very embarrassing
for me, Steve.

27:58.545 --> 28:00.544
You know why I beat
the shit outta him?

28:00.546 --> 28:02.005
You know why that happened?

28:02.007 --> 28:04.591
Because I was protecting
your precious fuckin' Joey.

28:04.593 --> 28:06.178
That's fuckin' why!

28:09.555 --> 28:12.726
My precious Joey
was the decent one.

28:14.687 --> 28:17.022
You never knew when to stop.

28:18.356 --> 28:20.524
And you still don't.

28:20.526 --> 28:22.984
From where I'm sittin',
Joey didn't know when

28:22.986 --> 28:26.612
to stop either and that's
what got him killed.

28:26.614 --> 28:28.239
Yeah, well Joey always
wanted to be like you.

28:28.241 --> 28:29.867
What's that mean?

28:32.871 --> 28:36.624
Maybe it should've
been you instead of him.

28:48.053 --> 28:50.762
- Where the hell is this guy?
- I told you gettin' the dope.

28:50.764 --> 28:52.264
Oh.

28:52.266 --> 28:54.932
So tell me how big
that package is again.

28:54.934 --> 28:55.891
It's
enough powder to keep

28:55.893 --> 28:57.436
you happy for a while, buddy.

28:57.438 --> 28:59.105
It's been a while.

29:00.899 --> 29:02.774
Hello, Arny.

29:02.776 --> 29:03.736
Hey, Vin.

29:10.409 --> 29:12.909
What, what are you doing here?

29:12.911 --> 29:16.204
I heard the cops
picked you up today.

29:16.206 --> 29:17.371
What?

29:17.373 --> 29:18.497
Only held you in
there for a few minutes

29:18.499 --> 29:19.707
and then let you go.

29:19.709 --> 29:22.252
I don't know, what
does that say to you?

29:22.254 --> 29:24.086
They got nothing.

29:24.088 --> 29:28.758
They got nothing, I told 'em
nothing, they got nothing.

29:28.760 --> 29:31.511
I mean, I told 'em nothing.

29:31.513 --> 29:34.305
You don't have to worry.

29:34.307 --> 29:35.849
Look, they didn't get
nothin', please, Vinnie.

29:35.851 --> 29:37.059
Fuckin' rat!

29:37.061 --> 29:37.934
Don't do this.

29:42.315 --> 29:43.316
Hey!

29:44.526 --> 29:47.363
- Someone's coming.
- Come on, come on.

30:14.597 --> 30:16.767
I need to talk with you.

30:21.521 --> 30:23.146
I'm going in.

30:23.148 --> 30:26.068
What do you mean
you're going in?

30:27.986 --> 30:30.486
Joey let it slip, he's gone.

30:30.488 --> 30:31.987
You're fuckin' retired.

30:31.989 --> 30:33.823
Somebody's gotta do something.

30:33.825 --> 30:37.494
Frank Harris was
my protege, okay?

30:37.496 --> 30:40.121
He's probably a better
detective than I ever was.

30:40.123 --> 30:42.498
So just let the
police handle it.

30:42.500 --> 30:45.209
I knew you'd say that,
but I think this just

30:45.211 --> 30:47.044
might have to be
done another way.

30:47.046 --> 30:49.171
How come I don't
like the sound of that?

30:49.173 --> 30:50.881
I didn't think you would.

30:50.883 --> 30:53.927
Look, I go in as a fighter.

30:53.929 --> 30:56.013
I poke around, I ask some
questions, some some answers.

30:56.015 --> 30:57.764
It's no big deal.

30:57.766 --> 30:59.515
You make one mistake
they're gonna erase you

30:59.517 --> 31:03.354
from the planet and I
don't need two dead sons.

31:10.112 --> 31:14.450
I'm setting things right
for Joey and this family.

31:16.701 --> 31:17.868
I'm gonna start at O'Harrahs,

31:17.870 --> 31:19.910
a lot of bikers
and fighters there.

31:19.912 --> 31:21.705
- Stop it.
- No.

31:21.707 --> 31:23.332
- Fuck you.
- I'll make some noise

31:23.334 --> 31:25.585
and make a name for myself.

31:28.881 --> 31:31.590
Make sure you don't make
too big a name for yourself.

32:28.273 --> 32:30.690
Nice, very nice.

32:30.692 --> 32:31.859
I'm impressed.

32:43.330 --> 32:46.247
I like your moves, kid.

32:46.249 --> 32:47.373
Got a name?

32:47.375 --> 32:49.876
Sunny.

32:51.880 --> 32:53.755
You're here for
a reason, right?

32:53.757 --> 32:54.591
Right.

32:55.843 --> 32:57.383
I'm guessing it's not me.

32:59.680 --> 33:02.304
But if you really wanna
fight and make some cash.

33:02.306 --> 33:04.890
Come see my Friday
at the Raging Tiger.

33:04.892 --> 33:07.852
You run the Raging Tiger?

33:07.854 --> 33:11.190
And we take very
good care of our own.

33:12.276 --> 33:13.110
Cindy.

33:15.946 --> 33:20.157
Come here, darling.

33:20.159 --> 33:21.615
Why don't you show
Sunny here a good time.

33:25.831 --> 33:26.665
Love to.

33:29.500 --> 33:30.835
Come on, stud.

33:32.004 --> 33:35.505
You're not shy are ya?

33:35.507 --> 33:38.469
Do you
want me to be shy?

33:55.361 --> 33:56.360
Sunny.

33:58.863 --> 33:59.780
I was beginning to think

33:59.782 --> 34:01.198
You weren't gonna show.

34:01.200 --> 34:04.034
I wasn't, but then I
realized I like money.

34:04.036 --> 34:06.285
Strike that, I love money.

34:07.455 --> 34:09.373
You came to the right place.

34:09.375 --> 34:11.248
After what I seen
the other night,

34:11.250 --> 34:14.043
I got a feeling you're gonna
be doing big things for me.

34:14.045 --> 34:14.879
Great.

34:16.297 --> 34:18.589
So I wanna introduce you
to someone special tonight.

34:18.591 --> 34:20.091
- Who's that?
- Upstairs, come on.

34:32.813 --> 34:34.022
Who we got coming in?

34:34.024 --> 34:36.902
Vinnie wants to
bring in his new guy.

34:40.571 --> 34:42.239
- Bring him in.
- All right.

34:48.288 --> 34:49.123
Come on.

34:53.418 --> 34:55.085
Santo, this is Sunny.

34:55.087 --> 34:57.339
He's one hell of a fighter.

34:58.966 --> 35:00.632
You're Sunny?

35:00.634 --> 35:04.594
Been making quite a
name for yourself.

35:04.596 --> 35:07.638
Heard what you did
to Vinnie's boy.

35:07.640 --> 35:08.681
Yes, sir.

35:08.683 --> 35:10.725
It's an honor to
meet you, Santo.

35:10.727 --> 35:11.561
Okay.

35:17.484 --> 35:21.572
Now, if you can fight as
good as he says you can,

35:23.573 --> 35:25.950
gonna make us a lot of money.

35:27.201 --> 35:30.495
I got great plans for
a man of your talent,

35:30.497 --> 35:33.292
both inside and
outside the ring.

35:36.294 --> 35:40.048
So, you know not everybody
gets this meeting.

35:42.968 --> 35:46.805
So, hope you can live
up to your expectations.

35:47.973 --> 35:51.143
If you don't, I'll
be real disappointed.

35:55.939 --> 35:56.857
Understand?

35:58.734 --> 35:59.735
Perfectly.

36:00.819 --> 36:02.861
There's no
worries on this one.

36:02.863 --> 36:03.696
Oh yeah?

36:05.491 --> 36:07.866
Well, you can
see for yourself.

36:07.868 --> 36:10.326
Filling in for Matty,
taking on Straight Razor.

36:10.328 --> 36:12.872
Should be a great fight then.

36:14.082 --> 36:17.210
Vinnie, put 10g's on
our new friend here.

36:20.422 --> 36:21.507
Sure thing.

36:22.757 --> 36:26.094
Looking forward to
watching you fight.

36:27.513 --> 36:31.850
This could be the beginning
of a profitable relationship.

36:34.352 --> 36:35.812
Or the quick end.

36:42.361 --> 36:43.859
Yo, we're done here.

36:43.861 --> 36:45.446
Thank you, Santo.

37:48.761 --> 37:52.596
You suck, you
suck, you suck, you suck,

37:52.598 --> 37:56.558
you suck, you suck,
you suck, you suck,

37:56.560 --> 37:58.685
you suck, you suck, you suck.

40:38.013 --> 40:40.806
You know, that was a
really good fight, man.

40:40.808 --> 40:41.931
Yeah, you too.

40:41.933 --> 40:43.933
Thanks, I appreciate it.

40:43.935 --> 40:45.268
Yeah I know he
dropped a left a lot,

40:45.270 --> 40:47.728
making him open to
and overhand right.

40:47.730 --> 40:49.522
And then plus he kept leaning
heavy on his front left

40:49.524 --> 40:51.982
making him open to
leg kicks and sweeps.

40:51.984 --> 40:54.736
You got real ability
for observing weaknesses.

40:54.738 --> 40:58.489
Ah, you just gotta take advantage
of every chance you get.

40:58.491 --> 40:59.741
I'm Raymond.

40:59.743 --> 41:01.993
- Oh my name is...
- I know who you are.

41:01.995 --> 41:02.829
Steve.

41:04.122 --> 41:05.955
I don't know what
you're talking about.

41:05.957 --> 41:07.915
That's okay, I
won't say nothing.

41:07.917 --> 41:10.127
Besides, no one's
gonna know who you are.

41:10.129 --> 41:11.255
I barely did.

41:12.131 --> 41:14.797
You've been gone a long time.

41:14.799 --> 41:17.341
I don't know you.

41:23.975 --> 41:25.975
You just gonna walk
away after I say that?

41:25.977 --> 41:27.393
- Yup.
- And Vincent gets away

41:27.395 --> 41:28.562
with another one and
you throw everything

41:28.564 --> 41:30.649
away that Joey stood for.

41:31.817 --> 41:34.817
You knew my brother, Joey?

41:34.819 --> 41:36.654
- I get it.
- Get what?

41:37.823 --> 41:40.489
What I'm saying
is, is I get it.

41:40.491 --> 41:42.951
You gotta make it
right for your brother,

41:42.953 --> 41:44.161
and if I can help you,

41:44.163 --> 41:45.995
it kinda makes things
right for me too.

41:45.997 --> 41:48.665
Look if they find
out, we'll both be dead.

41:48.667 --> 41:51.167
I can't have your help,
they'll kill us both.

41:51.169 --> 41:55.964
Look, I couldn't get revenge
and make things for everyone.

41:55.966 --> 41:57.507
So I have to help you.

41:57.509 --> 42:00.134
I need to make things right
for me and my brother too.

42:00.136 --> 42:03.179
- That is way too dangerous.
- Hey Sunny.

42:03.181 --> 42:04.181
Hit the shower,
head over to the doc

42:04.183 --> 42:05.640
and get that eye fixed up.

42:05.642 --> 42:08.687
Vinnie says you
fight again tomorrow.

42:40.343 --> 42:42.719
What's going on, Joey?

42:42.721 --> 42:44.721
Undercover work, all right?

42:44.723 --> 42:46.431
I can't let you do this.

42:46.433 --> 42:49.018
Look, I got it covered, okay?

42:52.064 --> 42:53.772
It's good, it's good.

42:53.774 --> 42:55.234
You wanna come in?

43:05.995 --> 43:08.330
What's going on?

43:10.457 --> 43:11.709
Hey, Raymond.

43:12.584 --> 43:13.460
All good.

43:14.585 --> 43:16.127
You know you might
wanna put a little bit

43:16.129 --> 43:18.212
of crazy glue on that cut
before you fight tonight.

43:18.214 --> 43:21.591
Then again, these
people want blood.

43:21.593 --> 43:23.134
Thanks man, I'll do that.

43:23.136 --> 43:24.428
All right.

43:26.223 --> 43:28.390
Yo, what are you doing
after the fights tonight?

43:28.392 --> 43:30.225
Ah well, I don't know.

43:30.227 --> 43:32.810
Nothing much man, I'm
probably just gonna head home.

43:32.812 --> 43:33.895
Yo, me and my
girl are going out.

43:33.897 --> 43:35.855
She has a really cute friend.

43:35.857 --> 43:37.899
Wanna come?

43:39.152 --> 43:40.861
- Come on, man.
- I don't know, man.

43:40.863 --> 43:42.279
You can't always
be about business.

43:42.281 --> 43:44.781
You're gonna lose
your frickin' mind.

43:44.783 --> 43:45.699
- Yeah?
- Yeah, sure man.

43:45.701 --> 43:47.743
- Cool.
- All right.

43:47.745 --> 43:48.659
Yo, hopefully you don't have

43:48.661 --> 43:50.536
to meet me in the ring tonight.

43:50.538 --> 43:51.955
You shouldn't have
to explain to Alicia

43:51.957 --> 43:53.748
why your face is all messed
up on the first date.

43:53.750 --> 43:55.375
Are you kidding me?

43:55.377 --> 43:57.044
- It's like that?
- It is.

43:57.046 --> 43:59.212
- Oh, man.
- See you later.

43:59.214 --> 44:02.134
All right
man, you got it.

46:18.145 --> 46:21.897
Yeah!

47:14.826 --> 47:17.326
Very difficult.

47:17.328 --> 47:19.747
Looks like a suicide attempt.

47:26.129 --> 47:28.464
They're over here, Harris.

47:35.848 --> 47:37.888
That makes four
fighters found dead.

47:37.890 --> 47:39.223
What do we got?

47:39.225 --> 47:40.059
Squat.

47:41.310 --> 47:44.145
I want answers, Gary,
I want them now.

47:44.147 --> 47:46.313
You know the press is
gonna be all over this.

47:46.315 --> 47:49.942
I think it's a little
too late for that, Harris.

47:49.944 --> 47:51.279
Shit, not her.

47:54.283 --> 47:56.535
Keep this area blocked off.

47:58.411 --> 48:01.495
Detective Harris, what
do we have over there?

48:01.497 --> 48:02.832
A fourth victim?

48:04.042 --> 48:05.417
Is there some kind
of serial killer

48:05.419 --> 48:08.962
that's getting a hard
on from fighters?

48:08.964 --> 48:10.714
Is that all necessary?

48:10.716 --> 48:12.132
So, you're making
a confession?

48:12.134 --> 48:13.966
There is a serial
killer on the loose?

48:13.968 --> 48:15.469
I never said that.

48:15.471 --> 48:17.721
Is there anything you'd
like to tell me about that?

48:17.723 --> 48:20.348
I'm not at liberty to say.

48:20.350 --> 48:24.018
There's a homicide
investigation, that's it.

48:24.020 --> 48:25.812
When I'm ready to make
a public statement,

48:25.814 --> 48:28.022
you will be notified.

48:29.234 --> 48:31.400
Frank, I don't know
if you realize this,

48:31.402 --> 48:34.237
but I have the
power to help you.

48:34.239 --> 48:37.114
Don't act like you give
a shit about these people.

48:37.116 --> 48:40.201
All that you care about is
breaking the news first.

48:40.203 --> 48:41.536
You're a parasite.

48:41.538 --> 48:43.580
You, my dear, are
hiding something.

48:43.582 --> 48:45.957
And that something happens
to be a serial killer

48:45.959 --> 48:48.127
on the loose in this town.

48:49.712 --> 48:51.922
You're just afraid to leak
information because you're afraid

48:51.924 --> 48:55.801
it's gonna damage your
precious little career.

48:55.803 --> 48:56.884
I don't give a shit what you

48:56.886 --> 48:58.805
- say about me, okay?
- Okay.

49:00.265 --> 49:02.306
But if you go around this
town claiming that there's

49:02.308 --> 49:07.314
a serial killer, the entire
town is going to go insane.

49:08.189 --> 49:09.438
And they have a right to know.

49:09.440 --> 49:10.649
That's right, but
not by your bullshit.

49:10.651 --> 49:12.319
Then just tell me!

49:13.946 --> 49:15.862
All right, screw this.

49:15.864 --> 49:17.571
I can go under if I want.

49:17.573 --> 49:18.408
Listen.

49:21.620 --> 49:24.286
Meet me at the station
house later tonight.

49:24.288 --> 49:26.415
Captain Bonds will
give a statement.

49:26.417 --> 49:28.208
Get rid of her.

49:28.210 --> 49:29.960
Get outta here.

49:29.962 --> 49:30.796
Go, now!

49:40.305 --> 49:43.431
Well, those twos I told
you about who were murdered,

49:43.433 --> 49:45.975
looked like they had
been through a war zone.

49:45.977 --> 49:48.645
Had lacerations, contusions
on their bodies and faces.

49:48.647 --> 49:51.857
- Creel, Creel, Creel, Creel.
- Knife wounds?

49:51.859 --> 49:56.321
No, more like full contact
fighting without gloves.

49:58.114 --> 50:00.574
What does the brass
have to say about this?

50:00.576 --> 50:05.414
They want it done
quickly and quietly, what else?

50:15.799 --> 50:18.591
Concentrate, smart ass.

50:18.593 --> 50:20.509
This is serious business.

50:20.511 --> 50:22.180
Don't screw this up.

50:26.810 --> 50:28.187
I know, I know.

50:29.145 --> 50:31.355
Look you guys chose me.

50:31.357 --> 50:33.984
We're gonna get these bastards.

50:48.582 --> 50:50.165
This is to Raymond
for shutting up

50:50.167 --> 50:51.375
that women in the movie theater.

50:51.377 --> 50:52.333
- Oh, my God, yes babe.
- I thought I was

50:52.335 --> 50:54.129
gonna kill her, oh my God.

50:55.129 --> 50:56.922
That lady was so annoying.

50:56.924 --> 50:58.839
I hate when people
talk during the movie.

50:58.841 --> 51:00.634
It's obnoxious.

51:00.636 --> 51:02.805
That movie was so weird.

51:03.846 --> 51:04.763
Why was it weird?

51:04.765 --> 51:06.223
I thought it was pretty cool.

51:06.225 --> 51:09.893
Well, what I mean is it
was weird, but in a cool way.

51:09.895 --> 51:12.228
What does that even
mean, weird in a cool way.

51:12.230 --> 51:13.938
I don't know,
it worked for me.

51:13.940 --> 51:14.772
Yeah, me too.

51:14.774 --> 51:16.315
I thought it was great.

51:16.317 --> 51:18.152
What about you, Sunny?

51:19.488 --> 51:21.862
How about you,
Sunny, you like it?

51:21.864 --> 51:23.239
Sunny, you okay?

51:24.243 --> 51:25.574
Are we keeping you up?

51:25.576 --> 51:27.118
Yeah, no, I'm sorry.

51:27.120 --> 51:30.746
I just, I've just been fighting
and training a lot lately.

51:30.748 --> 51:32.748
I'm exhausted babe, I
don't mean nothing by it.

51:32.750 --> 51:33.833
Oh.

51:33.835 --> 51:34.710
- I'm just exhausted.
- I got something that

51:34.712 --> 51:36.585
can keep you up.

51:36.587 --> 51:39.422
What did you say?

51:39.424 --> 51:41.257
- Thanks, bud.
- Nothing, I said I've

51:41.259 --> 51:43.676
been fighting and
training a lot lately too.

51:43.678 --> 51:45.219
Uh, that's not what he said.

51:46.765 --> 51:49.056
I said, well I said I got
something you can keep up too.

51:50.477 --> 51:52.601
Okay, well I'm gonna
go to the bathroom.

51:52.603 --> 51:53.895
- The subtle type.
- Wow.

51:53.897 --> 51:55.772
You know what, I'm
gonna come with you.

51:55.774 --> 51:56.942
We'll be back.

52:07.785 --> 52:10.411
Did you hear what the
commissioner said the other night?

52:10.413 --> 52:12.621
You know he used to work
with my father, right?

52:12.623 --> 52:13.459
Yeah.

52:14.585 --> 52:17.252
They found another
two fighter's bodies.

52:17.254 --> 52:18.462
I known these guys
a really long time.

52:18.464 --> 52:19.962
They were good dudes.

52:19.964 --> 52:24.510
Not like these other scumbags
we see with no conscience.

52:26.346 --> 52:28.848
This is getting out of hand.

52:30.975 --> 52:35.812
The question is, what
are we gonna do about it?

52:35.814 --> 52:37.313
I don't know.

52:37.315 --> 52:38.522
I got nothing.

52:38.524 --> 52:40.192
Well, we better dig
up something quick

52:40.194 --> 52:42.446
or one of us might be next.

52:43.739 --> 52:47.076
I know, I was
thinking the same thing.

53:01.089 --> 53:03.839
Let me do that.

53:49.053 --> 53:50.096
Oh, my God.

54:08.741 --> 54:09.989
I finally got a chance to get

54:09.991 --> 54:11.783
on the golf course
again last weekend.

54:11.785 --> 54:13.076
It's about time.

54:13.078 --> 54:14.493
I didn't lose my touch.

54:19.042 --> 54:20.419
Detective Harris.

54:21.462 --> 54:22.546
Uh huh, yeah.

54:24.339 --> 54:25.714
No shit?

54:25.716 --> 54:26.672
Hold 'em there.

54:26.674 --> 54:29.091
We'll be right there.

54:29.093 --> 54:30.551
What happened?

54:30.553 --> 54:32.846
That junkie snitch Arny
Simms, just got out of his coma.

54:32.848 --> 54:35.223
- You mean?
- He's agreed to testify.

54:41.439 --> 54:45.317
So I'm looking at
25 on A, 1,700 on B.

54:45.319 --> 54:47.904
Yeah, I don't know about C yet.

54:49.364 --> 54:50.906
- See what happens I guess.
- We'll see what happens.

54:50.908 --> 54:51.950
So that's uh.

54:52.951 --> 54:54.620
Grab that scumbag.

54:56.538 --> 54:58.455
Vincent Gaeta,
you're under arrest

54:58.457 --> 55:00.623
for the murder of
Joseph Colderon.

55:00.625 --> 55:02.667
You have
the right to remain...

55:02.669 --> 55:04.296
This one is mine.

55:05.631 --> 55:06.922
You have the right

55:06.924 --> 55:08.130
- to remain silent.
- Yeah, all right.

55:08.132 --> 55:09.382
Anything you say
can and will be

55:09.384 --> 55:11.009
used against you
in a court of law.

55:11.011 --> 55:12.094
You have a right to an attorney.

55:12.096 --> 55:13.013
Whatever.

55:20.478 --> 55:23.813
Damn, I'm so
pissed off right now.

55:23.815 --> 55:26.900
This shit's bad for business.

55:26.902 --> 55:31.071
Who the fuck coulda dropped
the dime on Vinnie and Rocco?

55:31.073 --> 55:32.908
Maybe, I don't know.

55:34.326 --> 55:35.951
What you got something to say?

55:35.953 --> 55:36.954
It's just.

55:39.163 --> 55:40.413
What are you
nervous or something?

55:40.415 --> 55:41.580
No.

55:41.582 --> 55:43.165
Well then spit it out.

55:43.167 --> 55:45.042
Listen, there's
only been one thing

55:45.044 --> 55:47.004
different around here lately.

55:47.006 --> 55:51.341
Victor, I'm not into solving
riddles right now, okay?

55:51.343 --> 55:52.678
- Sunny.
- Sunny?

55:55.431 --> 55:56.932
Call it a hunch.

55:58.058 --> 56:00.268
I think we oughta kill him.

56:01.145 --> 56:02.351
What are you talking about?

56:02.353 --> 56:04.062
That kid's making me
a shit load of money.

56:04.064 --> 56:05.897
You want me to kill
him on a hunch?

56:05.899 --> 56:08.942
I've always been loyal to
you and to this organization,

56:08.944 --> 56:10.902
Santo and I'm telling you,

56:10.904 --> 56:14.533
there's something not
right about that guy.

56:19.705 --> 56:21.913
Put a tail on 'em then.

56:21.915 --> 56:25.458
No, this is gonna
get the personal touch.

56:25.460 --> 56:27.629
I'll go follow him myself.

56:31.049 --> 56:32.676
Get it done then.

56:53.906 --> 56:58.324
My hero.

56:58.326 --> 57:01.243
Hey, hey, hey, hey,
I'm glad you're here.

57:01.245 --> 57:02.745
Frank's got some good news.

57:02.747 --> 57:05.748
That's right, at 10:53 a.m.,

57:05.750 --> 57:09.920
we arrested Vincent
Gaeta with Joey's murder.

57:09.922 --> 57:11.337
That's great.

57:11.339 --> 57:13.924
Yeah, you sure you got enough
evidence to make it stick?

57:13.926 --> 57:17.009
Oh yeah, we have
witnesses, testimony,

57:17.011 --> 57:18.511
the snitch that got Joey in.

57:18.513 --> 57:20.596
And you're sure
he'll actually talk?

57:20.598 --> 57:23.558
When someone as dangerous
as Vincent shoots you twice

57:23.560 --> 57:27.020
in the chest and leaves you
for dead, even the toughest

57:27.022 --> 57:30.774
of wise guys, they come
crying to us for help.

57:30.776 --> 57:32.775
And that Arny Simms,
he's probably one

57:32.777 --> 57:36.071
of the biggest
cowards I've ever met.

57:36.073 --> 57:37.656
There you go, Steve.

57:37.658 --> 57:40.283
Your work's done for ya.

57:40.285 --> 57:43.203
What about the other 3
fighters that were murdered?

57:43.205 --> 57:46.330
Just because Vincent's gone
doesn't mean they're gonna stop,

57:46.332 --> 57:47.790
and what about Santo?

57:47.792 --> 57:49.292
Come on, come on.

57:49.294 --> 57:50.752
It's none of your business.

57:50.754 --> 57:52.129
It's over.

57:52.131 --> 57:54.966
I need to finish
what I started.

57:58.803 --> 58:00.763
Just keeps pushing it.

58:12.067 --> 58:16.027
He just doesn't
wanna bury two sons.

58:16.029 --> 58:19.906
I know, but I can't
just walk away now.

58:19.908 --> 58:21.160
Come with me.

58:29.042 --> 58:32.377
Look, I'm glad you
feel the way you to.

58:32.379 --> 58:36.672
I don't like your tactics or
the way you conduct yourself.

58:36.674 --> 58:41.344
Look, the brass is gonna come
down on these guys, okay?

58:41.346 --> 58:45.390
Just give it a few days
and then we'll get you back

58:45.392 --> 58:49.312
on the inside with our
support this time, okay?

58:50.605 --> 58:52.688
I can't do that.

58:52.690 --> 58:54.232
Then I'm gonna
have to bring you in.

58:54.234 --> 58:55.484
You hear me?

58:55.486 --> 58:57.988
Everyone is going
to be swept up.

58:59.781 --> 59:03.116
There's a good guy on
the inside, helping me out.

59:03.118 --> 59:05.951
His brother was
killed just like Joey.

59:05.953 --> 59:07.161
What's his name?

59:07.163 --> 59:08.415
Raymond Cruz.

59:09.415 --> 59:11.250
Raymond, you got it.

59:12.210 --> 59:13.044
Thanks.

59:13.962 --> 59:14.877
Thank you.

59:14.879 --> 59:16.506
I'll be in touch.

59:46.411 --> 59:47.576
Oh yeah.

59:47.578 --> 59:48.413
It's him.

59:50.248 --> 59:53.084
But wait, I saw
him with that cop.

59:54.169 --> 59:55.794
Shit.

59:55.796 --> 59:57.212
Arny too?

59:57.214 --> 01:00:00.551
God, you can't trust
anybody these days.

01:00:03.094 --> 01:00:06.679
Want me to go in
and take care of it?

01:00:06.681 --> 01:00:07.515
All right.

01:00:08.642 --> 01:00:11.976
I'll go pay our
friend Arny a visit.

01:00:11.978 --> 01:00:13.439
What about Sunny?

01:00:17.609 --> 01:00:18.610
Creel, yeah.

01:00:37.796 --> 01:00:40.004
You remember this?

01:00:40.006 --> 01:00:43.382
I think you made
this in wood shop.

01:00:43.384 --> 01:00:45.092
You know, I was watching
you from the window.

01:00:45.094 --> 01:00:48.346
I was kinda hoping that
you wouldn't drive away.

01:00:48.348 --> 01:00:49.806
Just like when I was a kid.

01:00:49.808 --> 01:00:52.100
No, for your entire life.

01:00:52.102 --> 01:00:54.478
Did you really want
me sticking around, Dad?

01:00:54.480 --> 01:00:57.063
After everything I put
you and mom through.

01:00:57.065 --> 01:00:59.982
Of course, you're our son.

01:00:59.984 --> 01:01:02.611
No matter how reckless and
irresponsible you were,

01:01:02.613 --> 01:01:04.281
we always loved you.

01:01:05.406 --> 01:01:07.910
And we always will, come here.

01:01:09.370 --> 01:01:11.205
Thanks, Dad.

01:01:15.875 --> 01:01:17.294
You going back?

01:01:18.754 --> 01:01:20.672
Harris can handle it.

01:01:35.020 --> 01:01:36.522
Hello, Dad, hey.

01:01:39.649 --> 01:01:41.190
It's Arny.

01:01:41.192 --> 01:01:42.567
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:01:42.569 --> 01:01:46.071
No, nobody's here right now, no.

01:01:46.073 --> 01:01:48.200
Yeah, I have been calling.

01:01:49.826 --> 01:01:52.326
Yeah, I'm sure you're busy.

01:01:52.328 --> 01:01:55.289
But um, why, 'cause
I wanna see you.

01:01:56.207 --> 01:01:58.290
I need to see you.

01:01:58.292 --> 01:02:00.002
No, I'm clean.

01:02:00.004 --> 01:02:01.880
Dad, I'm clean I swear.

01:02:04.132 --> 01:02:05.884
506 Ruth Court, yeah.

01:02:10.221 --> 01:02:11.888
You can't make it.

01:02:11.890 --> 01:02:12.848
What do you mean
you can't make it?

01:02:12.850 --> 01:02:14.518
You have to make it.

01:02:16.728 --> 01:02:20.105
I don't think I can come to you.

01:02:20.107 --> 01:02:22.440
They don't allow me to leave.

01:02:22.442 --> 01:02:24.569
Can't you, a house guest?

01:02:26.321 --> 01:02:28.279
That sounds great.

01:02:28.281 --> 01:02:30.450
That sounds great, but uh.

01:02:34.038 --> 01:02:34.872
Okay, yes.

01:02:36.205 --> 01:02:37.748
Yes, I will come to you.

01:02:37.750 --> 01:02:39.248
I will see you.

01:02:39.250 --> 01:02:40.627
I'll come to you.

01:02:41.669 --> 01:02:44.129
I'll see you soon, okay?

01:02:44.131 --> 01:02:44.964
Okay, bye.

01:03:11.950 --> 01:03:12.785
Harris.

01:03:15.453 --> 01:03:16.788
What is it, Dad?

01:03:17.665 --> 01:03:20.084
No, Mike's fine, thank God.

01:03:24.462 --> 01:03:26.337
- He's off.
- Who?

01:03:26.339 --> 01:03:31.010
That scumbag murdering piece
of shit, Vincent, is off.

01:03:40.645 --> 01:03:41.937
How?

01:03:41.939 --> 01:03:43.730
They key witness,
they found him with

01:03:43.732 --> 01:03:46.065
a bullet hole in his head.

01:03:46.067 --> 01:03:48.150
And the DA had not
enough evidence

01:03:48.152 --> 01:03:50.821
to keep him and
they let him free.

01:03:50.823 --> 01:03:52.116
Motherfucker.

01:03:54.243 --> 01:03:56.326
I'm so sorry, Steve.

01:03:56.328 --> 01:03:57.161
Me too.

01:03:58.080 --> 01:03:59.620
I'm going back in.

01:03:59.622 --> 01:04:01.123
I'll stop this myself.

01:04:01.125 --> 01:04:03.792
Normally, I wouldn't
like to hear that.

01:04:03.794 --> 01:04:06.377
But at this point I
really don't think

01:04:06.379 --> 01:04:08.964
we have another choice.

01:04:08.966 --> 01:04:12.009
So you're going to help me?

01:04:12.011 --> 01:04:12.844
Yeah.

01:04:20.435 --> 01:04:21.976
What do you think?

01:04:21.978 --> 01:04:24.480
You can't go in there alone.

01:04:26.024 --> 01:04:28.525
Maybe I know
someone who will help.

01:04:28.527 --> 01:04:29.650
Raymond?

01:04:29.652 --> 01:04:30.654
I hope so.

01:04:31.613 --> 01:04:33.237
Okay.

01:04:33.239 --> 01:04:38.036
You make sure you contact me
the minute you get in there.

01:04:39.370 --> 01:04:43.290
I don't wanna lose
someone else I care about.

01:04:43.292 --> 01:04:44.710
Thanks, Harris.

01:05:00.433 --> 01:05:01.266
Alicia, I...

01:05:02.518 --> 01:05:05.397
Just don't even
say anything, okay?

01:05:06.899 --> 01:05:08.734
You do you, all right?

01:05:10.194 --> 01:05:12.029
That's why I love you.

01:05:13.821 --> 01:05:16.407
I love you too, baby.

01:05:58.491 --> 01:06:01.368
He's awake.

01:06:03.872 --> 01:06:04.707
Yeah.

01:06:07.209 --> 01:06:10.879
Good to see you back
with the living, Steve.

01:06:12.339 --> 01:06:16.799
What, nothing goes on in
this town without me knowing.

01:06:16.801 --> 01:06:18.969
Now the one thing I do know is

01:06:18.971 --> 01:06:21.638
you're becoming a
real pain in the ass.

01:06:24.435 --> 01:06:26.143
I know, I know.

01:06:26.145 --> 01:06:27.228
That's funny.

01:06:28.480 --> 01:06:30.272
Look, so is this.

01:06:30.274 --> 01:06:31.107
Vinnie!

01:06:33.484 --> 01:06:36.821
Didn't expect to
see me again, did ya?

01:06:38.741 --> 01:06:39.575
Surprise!

01:06:46.540 --> 01:06:48.125
Save it, save it.

01:06:51.337 --> 01:06:56.300
We don't want him all messed
up going into tonight's fight.

01:06:57.968 --> 01:07:00.721
It's a big anticipated
death-match.

01:07:02.681 --> 01:07:04.350
Worth a lotta money.

01:07:07.060 --> 01:07:11.814
And nobody's gonna bet on a
fighter already beat to shit.

01:07:13.192 --> 01:07:17.736
You're a lucky piece
of shit, you know that?

01:07:17.738 --> 01:07:19.321
Get fucked!

01:07:21.408 --> 01:07:23.074
Stevie, boy.

01:07:23.076 --> 01:07:27.330
It's you that's gonna get
fucked or do the fuckin'.

01:07:29.040 --> 01:07:30.707
It's a death-match.

01:07:30.709 --> 01:07:32.125
Fight to the death.

01:07:32.127 --> 01:07:35.381
So the outcome is
completely up to you.

01:07:36.924 --> 01:07:41.009
I'm not doing shit,
so just fuckin' kill me.

01:07:41.011 --> 01:07:43.136
You know what, really,

01:07:43.138 --> 01:07:46.598
I thought you would say
something cute like that.

01:07:46.600 --> 01:07:49.185
But like always, Santo's first.

01:07:54.315 --> 01:07:55.234
Get him up.

01:08:02.448 --> 01:08:04.074
Fuckin' rat's son.

01:08:04.076 --> 01:08:06.368
Whole fuckin' family of rats.

01:08:06.370 --> 01:08:08.286
The whole family is rats.

01:08:08.288 --> 01:08:09.245
Yeah, fuckin' rats.

01:08:09.247 --> 01:08:10.538
Go ahead, go ahead.

01:08:10.540 --> 01:08:13.040
Look at me, look
at me, look at me.

01:08:13.042 --> 01:08:15.252
Your fuckin' son is in there
and he's gonna fuckin' die.

01:08:15.254 --> 01:08:16.335
How do you like that, huh?

01:08:16.337 --> 01:08:18.712
Go ahead, go ahead.

01:08:18.715 --> 01:08:20.756
You wanna get me
don't ya, huh, huh?

01:08:20.759 --> 01:08:22.426
Go ahead, yeah, spit in my face.

01:08:22.428 --> 01:08:23.634
I wanna fuckin' drink it.

01:08:23.636 --> 01:08:25.511
Go ahead, go ahead tough guy.

01:08:25.514 --> 01:08:27.430
Huh, huh, huh?

01:08:29.893 --> 01:08:31.810
Give
him a look inside.

01:08:31.812 --> 01:08:34.562
No, let 'em go!

01:08:36.899 --> 01:08:38.191
Give me a kiss, baby.

01:08:38.193 --> 01:08:40.151
Give me a fuckin'
kiss, come here.

01:08:40.153 --> 01:08:42.529
Give me a fuckin' kiss.

01:08:42.531 --> 01:08:44.279
- Come on, whore.
- I'll fuckin' kill yous all,

01:08:44.282 --> 01:08:46.825
- you motherfuckers.
- Come on.

01:08:46.827 --> 01:08:48.495
- Ah shit.
- Get off.

01:08:49.662 --> 01:08:51.620
Look at me,
fuckin' look at me!

01:08:56.045 --> 01:08:59.715
Oh God, I ain't had
a good laugh in years.

01:09:00.965 --> 01:09:02.466
Now look.

01:09:02.468 --> 01:09:06.511
I suggest you get ready
for your next fight.

01:09:06.513 --> 01:09:10.057
What do
you mean next fight?

01:09:10.059 --> 01:09:13.100
Give him the rules, Vinnie.

01:09:13.103 --> 01:09:16.689
The fight don't stop
till someone's dead.

01:09:18.983 --> 01:09:20.566
That's simple, right?

01:09:20.568 --> 01:09:22.984
Now look, consider
yourself lucky.

01:09:22.987 --> 01:09:26.198
I was gonna just
feed you to Creel,

01:09:26.200 --> 01:09:29.116
but I decided to make
a little more money.

01:09:29.118 --> 01:09:32.497
So you get to live a
little while longer.

01:09:36.626 --> 01:09:39.877
I wanna rip your
fuckin' heart out.

01:09:39.880 --> 01:09:42.091
You will fight the fight

01:09:44.510 --> 01:09:47.845
for eternity until
it's your day to die.

01:09:51.433 --> 01:09:55.604
Now, if you make me enough
money and fill my need,

01:09:59.649 --> 01:10:02.819
maybe, just maybe,
I'll let them live.

01:10:06.823 --> 01:10:08.030
Take him to his cell.

01:10:08.032 --> 01:10:10.366
Come on, sit down.

01:10:10.368 --> 01:10:11.286
Go on, sit.

01:10:13.580 --> 01:10:15.246
- Come on.
- Go fuck yourself.

01:10:15.248 --> 01:10:16.832
I'll fuckin' kill you all you...

01:10:34.268 --> 01:10:35.102
Yeah!

01:10:43.943 --> 01:10:44.777
Yeah.

01:11:00.961 --> 01:11:03.837
Vinnie, Vinnie,
Vinnie, Vinnie, Vinnie, Vinnie,

01:11:03.839 --> 01:11:06.425
Vinnie, Vinnie, Vinnie, Vinnie.

01:11:07.800 --> 01:11:09.759
Ladies and gentlemen,
distinguished guests of honor.

01:11:09.761 --> 01:11:12.846
I welcome you to the
opening fight this evening.

01:11:16.268 --> 01:11:20.353
Now as you know I am not your
host, but his humble servant.

01:11:20.355 --> 01:11:24.941
Tonight's fight is a
fuckin' personal one to me.

01:11:29.782 --> 01:11:32.949
A fighter from the Raging
Tiger has proven worthy

01:11:32.951 --> 01:11:36.119
to be standing here in
front of all of you.

01:11:36.121 --> 01:11:39.955
Let's bring him out right
now to his first death-match.

01:11:39.957 --> 01:11:42.001
Gladiator Steve Calderon.

01:12:06.318 --> 01:12:09.488
His opponent in his
fourth death-match,

01:12:10.322 --> 01:12:12.489
you ladies love this guy.

01:12:15.702 --> 01:12:16.536
Yeah.

01:12:17.871 --> 01:12:20.958
The Spanish conquer,
Fernando DeLega.

01:13:00.706 --> 01:13:01.913
Oh, yeah!

01:13:01.915 --> 01:13:04.624
Kill, kill,
kill, kill, kill,

01:13:04.626 --> 01:13:07.418
Kill, kill, kill, kill, kill,

01:13:07.420 --> 01:13:11.674
Kill, kill, kill.

01:13:23.354 --> 01:13:25.439
Get in there.

01:13:26.439 --> 01:13:29.942
Sit down.

01:13:33.072 --> 01:13:35.696
Don't you ever do that again.

01:13:35.698 --> 01:13:40.035
What's the matter, didn't
satisfy your lust for blood?

01:13:40.037 --> 01:13:41.622
Not mine, theirs.

01:13:44.082 --> 01:13:45.750
I fill my own needs.

01:13:47.627 --> 01:13:50.464
You won't kill,
I'll force you to.

01:13:53.759 --> 01:13:55.258
You want more?

01:13:55.260 --> 01:13:56.509
- Take the fuckin' bat,
- More?

01:13:56.511 --> 01:13:58.427
And stick it up
her fuckin' ass.

01:13:58.429 --> 01:14:00.097
Yeah this, you want this?

01:14:00.099 --> 01:14:02.432
How about I fuckin'
sledgehammer her head, huh?

01:14:02.434 --> 01:14:04.892
Huh, how about I do that, huh?

01:14:04.894 --> 01:14:07.186
My fuckin' boy Vinnie's
got your son in there.

01:14:07.188 --> 01:14:08.187
You know what he's gonna do?

01:14:08.189 --> 01:14:10.106
He's gonna fuck 'em.

01:14:10.108 --> 01:14:12.609
Like's it rough, baby.

01:14:12.611 --> 01:14:14.402
We're not fuckin' scary?

01:14:14.404 --> 01:14:16.445
- Come on, give me a kiss.
- Fuck him.

01:14:16.447 --> 01:14:18.490
Both of yous, give
me a fuckin' kiss.

01:14:18.492 --> 01:14:20.700
Come and fuckin' get some, huh?

01:14:20.702 --> 01:14:22.451
Look at this baby, look at this.

01:14:22.453 --> 01:14:24.329
You're fuckin'
turning me on, baby.

01:14:24.331 --> 01:14:26.455
You're fuckin' turning me on

01:14:26.457 --> 01:14:27.958
- Come on.
- You asshole,

01:14:27.960 --> 01:14:30.459
I'll fuckin' kill
you all, you fucks.

01:14:30.461 --> 01:14:33.879
What, eat shit!

01:14:33.881 --> 01:14:35.049
Hey!

01:14:37.094 --> 01:14:39.430
Save it for your next fight.

01:14:50.773 --> 01:14:52.984
Yeah, Vinnie, yeah!

01:14:57.281 --> 01:14:59.573
Ladies and gentleman,
earlier tonight

01:14:59.575 --> 01:15:02.491
this warrior tried
to prove a point.

01:15:02.493 --> 01:15:05.078
That you don't have to
kill to be victorious.

01:15:08.584 --> 01:15:09.833
Now let's welcome him in with

01:15:09.835 --> 01:15:13.003
a record of 2-0, Steve Calderon.

01:15:21.721 --> 01:15:23.181
You suck!

01:15:39.614 --> 01:15:43.741
And his opponent making
his debut in the Lucifer Den,

01:15:43.743 --> 01:15:48.204
who is also a rising
star at the Raging Tiger.

01:15:56.422 --> 01:15:59.175
Let's bring him
in, Raymond Cruz.

01:16:07.475 --> 01:16:08.559
Yeah!

01:16:18.403 --> 01:16:20.695
Let's go, let's go!

01:16:20.697 --> 01:16:24.033
Let's go!

01:16:26.036 --> 01:16:27.619

01:16:33.335 --> 01:16:34.584
Boo!

01:16:34.586 --> 01:16:36.837
- Push it!
- Come on, come on, come on!

01:16:36.839 --> 01:16:39.130
Fight, fight,
fight, fight, fight.

01:16:39.132 --> 01:16:41.258
- Yeah!
- Fight, fight, fight, fight,

01:16:41.260 --> 01:16:43.301
fight, fight,
fight, fight, fight.

01:16:43.303 --> 01:16:44.138
Come on!

01:16:49.393 --> 01:16:51.767
Fight, fight,
fight, fight, fight,

01:16:51.769 --> 01:16:54.812
fight, fight, fight,
fight, fight, fight,

01:16:54.814 --> 01:16:56.482
fight, fight, fight.

01:17:16.170 --> 01:17:19.465
- Come on, boy, come on.
- Get up, yeah!

01:17:23.344 --> 01:17:25.511
Come on, let's go!

01:17:28.974 --> 01:17:30.476
- Yeah!
- Let's go!

01:17:41.403 --> 01:17:44.029
You do it again.

01:17:44.031 --> 01:17:45.405
Fight, fight,
fight, fight, fight.

01:17:45.407 --> 01:17:47.449
To another
low kick, let's go.

01:17:47.451 --> 01:17:49.825
Do it again, do it again!

01:17:49.827 --> 01:17:50.660
Yeah, fight!

01:17:54.123 --> 01:17:54.957
Help me.

01:18:05.219 --> 01:18:07.009
Come on!

01:18:07.011 --> 01:18:08.427
Come on, man, what
the fuck is going

01:18:08.429 --> 01:18:09.887
- on with these guys?
- Come on, come on.

01:18:09.889 --> 01:18:12.516
Come on
guys, get it done.

01:18:12.518 --> 01:18:15.395
Come on.

01:18:18.357 --> 01:18:19.897
Enough!

01:18:19.899 --> 01:18:20.733
Enough!

01:18:37.626 --> 01:18:42.545
These two warriors have such a
sense of justice, don't they?

01:18:45.800 --> 01:18:48.093
Almost makes me
wanna let them live.

01:18:51.724 --> 01:18:53.097
Do you disagree?

01:18:56.353 --> 01:19:00.774
These two warriors don't
deserve to die from a bullet.

01:19:03.277 --> 01:19:08.282
They deserve to die at the
hands of the purest warrior.

01:19:14.287 --> 01:19:17.707
Ladies and gentlemen,
get your bets ready

01:19:19.126 --> 01:19:22.629

present the main event.

Kill, kill,

kill, kill, kill, kill,
kill, kill, kill, kill.

01:25:59.734 --> 01:26:03.445
Life may not always be
what you want it to be.

01:26:03.447 --> 01:26:06.155
Sometimes you gotta dig deep.

01:26:06.157 --> 01:26:09.409
Deeper than you ever did before.

01:26:09.411 --> 01:26:12.331
You reach inside
and you let it go.

01:26:16.919 --> 01:26:17.836
Now get up.

01:27:02.464 --> 01:27:04.299
Is that all you got?

01:27:53.349 --> 01:27:55.432
Kill him, kill him!

01:27:58.103 --> 01:28:00.439
Shoot him, shoot that punk!

01:28:03.942 --> 01:28:05.152
Son of a bitch.

01:28:08.447 --> 01:28:11.700
Everyone
get on the ground!

01:28:13.410 --> 01:28:17.665
Get on the ground!

01:28:22.211 --> 01:28:25.881
Come on.

01:28:37.309 --> 01:28:40.227
Shit, just
shoot him, hey, you're done!

01:28:42.648 --> 01:28:43.646
No, no, no.

01:28:43.648 --> 01:28:46.232
Hey, Santo, don't move.

01:28:46.234 --> 01:28:48.610
Took care of your
family, now it's your turn.

01:28:48.612 --> 01:28:50.154
I don't think so.

01:28:52.032 --> 01:28:53.867
Pleasure's all mine.

01:28:56.662 --> 01:28:58.285
I'll be out in an hour.

01:28:58.287 --> 01:29:00.498
Not if I shoot you first.

01:29:02.710 --> 01:29:04.502
Hands up!

01:29:37.327 --> 01:29:38.869
Ah, you look like shit.

01:29:38.871 --> 01:29:40.579
- Put your hands up!
- Thanks.

01:29:40.581 --> 01:29:42.121
But you did good, kid.

01:29:42.123 --> 01:29:43.664
Thank you, Dad.

01:29:43.666 --> 01:29:47.209
I got someone here
who's waiting to see you.

01:29:47.211 --> 01:29:49.547
- Baby.
- Hands up, hands up!
