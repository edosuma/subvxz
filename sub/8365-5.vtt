WEBVTT

00:01.984 --> 00:03.359
Do you like this sweater?

00:03.609 --> 00:06.420
Jared Leto gave it to me and I've
always been on the fence about it.

00:07.651 --> 00:08.773
I don't know.

00:09.460 --> 00:10.476
What do you mean, you don't know?

00:10.602 --> 00:12.036
You either like it, or you don't like it.

00:12.203 --> 00:14.439
I mean, I like it 'cause
Jared Leto gave it to you,

00:14.464 --> 00:16.781
and he was my first kiss,
but I don't know if I like,

00:16.806 --> 00:17.984
like it, like it.

00:18.009 --> 00:20.320
Um, that's not really an answer.

00:20.436 --> 00:21.769
I feel really bad,

00:21.906 --> 00:23.740
I feel like there's something
burning in my throat.

00:23.774 --> 00:25.808
Oh my God, well, you could've
answered the question by now.

00:25.843 --> 00:27.296
So I guess I'm wearing it.

00:27.321 --> 00:29.945
Dad, can you bring me some juice?

00:29.970 --> 00:32.968
Johnny: Be right there, honey!
Moira: Yes, we'll be right there!

00:33.070 --> 00:34.671
I knew this day would come, John!

00:34.736 --> 00:36.103
Isolated, impoverished,

00:36.128 --> 00:37.996
cut off from all medical services!

00:38.140 --> 00:40.274
I only prayed it wouldn't be Alexis.

00:40.307 --> 00:43.125
- It's just a cold, Moira.
- Oh, it's always just a cold, John,

00:43.160 --> 00:45.827
until it's full blown... Typhoid!

00:45.862 --> 00:47.406
Alexis: I don't have typhoid!

00:47.431 --> 00:49.890
Well, of course you don't,
what are the chances of that?!

00:49.915 --> 00:51.916
(Gasps) Do you remember Valentina?

00:52.086 --> 00:54.087
Our chambermaid in little Martinique?

00:54.122 --> 00:55.622
We all thought she had just a cold,

00:55.656 --> 00:56.990
until it was too late!

00:57.025 --> 00:58.392
I'll never shake the mental image

00:58.426 --> 01:01.664
of her frothing and
flailing in the water taxi!

01:01.689 --> 01:04.123
Alexis: I can still hear you!

01:04.149 --> 01:06.117
We love you, Alexis!

01:06.142 --> 01:09.111
- Don't we?!
- We love you, Alexis.

01:09.283 --> 01:10.650
Tell her you're gonna bring her the juice.

01:10.675 --> 01:12.209
I am bringing the juice, Moira.

01:12.234 --> 01:14.109
John, don't touch her.

01:14.463 --> 01:16.097
Ohhh...

01:17.296 --> 01:19.731
Moira: This is as far as I go, Alexis.

01:19.992 --> 01:22.327
One of us has to stay safe for David.

01:22.352 --> 01:23.752
I'm already in the room.

01:23.777 --> 01:25.693
Johnny: See, we're still alive, Moira,

01:25.718 --> 01:27.153
I think we're gonna be okay.

01:27.187 --> 01:29.588
Of course you are, that's the spirit.

01:29.622 --> 01:33.292
I'm just going to close
this door until you're done.

01:33.326 --> 01:36.062
Sorry! (Chain clinks) I'm sorry!

01:36.096 --> 01:40.679

01:42.802 --> 01:44.370
(Birds chirp)

01:50.209 --> 01:52.576
Oh! Uh...

01:52.601 --> 01:54.203
Do you like this sweater?

01:55.579 --> 01:56.851
Honestly...

01:57.305 --> 01:59.807
While I admire your courage,

01:59.832 --> 02:01.843
uh, when it comes to fashion,

02:01.868 --> 02:03.703
I'm just not the best person to ask.

02:04.345 --> 02:05.713
- Okay.
- What's going on?

02:05.747 --> 02:07.335
Nothing.

02:07.360 --> 02:11.545
- Mm, you seem stressy.
- I'm not. I'm not stressy.

02:11.570 --> 02:15.656
I just want to make a
lasting impression, so...

02:15.724 --> 02:17.124
It's a job interview?

02:17.159 --> 02:18.693
For a "brand manager" position

02:18.727 --> 02:20.594
at an upscale boutique.

02:20.628 --> 02:22.007
In Elmdale?!

02:22.497 --> 02:24.064
Okay, there are certain lies I tell myself,

02:24.098 --> 02:25.799
and if you're any kind of a friend,

02:25.833 --> 02:28.301
you' will let me cling to those lies.

02:28.335 --> 02:31.871
And, drive me to the interview.

02:31.906 --> 02:34.140
So is this like, an either/or type thing?

02:34.175 --> 02:37.640
Can I help you cling to lies,
and not drive you to Elmdale?

02:37.912 --> 02:39.579
Okay, I'm gonna change my sweater,

02:39.613 --> 02:41.875
and meet you at your car, so.

02:42.506 --> 02:44.453
It's like a poncho.

02:45.666 --> 02:47.501
(Chuckles)

02:47.755 --> 02:49.122
So the guys says to me,

02:49.156 --> 02:52.671
"well, I wouldn't try that
with a fractured larynx!"

02:52.860 --> 02:55.461
I wouldn't try that, period!

02:55.495 --> 02:57.896
(Both laugh uproariously)

02:57.931 --> 03:00.065
- Morning, boys.
- Hi, Johnny.

03:00.100 --> 03:02.835
- Ahem!
- Oh man! Oh, boy.

03:05.138 --> 03:06.538
Well, if you gentlemen don't mind,

03:06.572 --> 03:08.373
I'd like to start my day.

03:08.407 --> 03:09.808
Yeah, me too, um...

03:09.843 --> 03:11.554
Do you guys wanna see a card trick?

03:11.579 --> 03:13.912
- Oh, I do. - Okay, first thing
I need is a deck of cards.

03:13.947 --> 03:15.680
All right, you know what, I
hate to break up this party,

03:15.715 --> 03:19.451
but this is my office, and I
do have a lot of work to do,

03:19.485 --> 03:21.253
so up, Roland.

03:21.287 --> 03:22.710
Your office?

03:22.735 --> 03:24.723
Uh, well that's kind of
interesting, Johnny,

03:24.758 --> 03:26.892
because I don't remember
seeing your application

03:26.926 --> 03:29.394
for a new business license.

03:29.428 --> 03:30.828
Oh jeez!

03:30.863 --> 03:33.397
To be a fly on the wall
for this conversation!

03:33.431 --> 03:35.179
Bob, you're in the room.

03:35.822 --> 03:38.323
You know, Johnny, it's
kind of standard procedure

03:38.348 --> 03:41.317
for new businesses to register.

03:41.439 --> 03:42.807
But then again, I guess
you don't really have

03:42.841 --> 03:44.809
a lot to register, do you?

03:44.843 --> 03:47.311
(Roland and Bob chuckle)

03:47.345 --> 03:48.712
Maybe not to you, Roland,

03:48.747 --> 03:50.915
but keep in mind I did start Rose Video

03:50.949 --> 03:52.917
with $2,000 dollars and a dream,

03:52.951 --> 03:55.019
so it's all about planning.

03:55.053 --> 03:56.788
I see it every day.

03:56.822 --> 03:59.223
Lots of quiet planning.

03:59.258 --> 04:01.759
Sure, he treats himself to a muffin or two,

04:01.794 --> 04:04.896
but uh, I get that that's
all part of the planning,

04:04.930 --> 04:06.007
right, Johnny?

04:07.332 --> 04:08.492
Could be.

04:09.233 --> 04:11.234
Yeah, could be. I mean...

04:11.636 --> 04:14.671
I could look at this muffin
and say, this is a fine muffin.

04:14.872 --> 04:17.007
I'd kill for a bagel, but
I haven't seen one bagel

04:17.041 --> 04:18.827
since I got to this town.

04:19.301 --> 04:21.512
Now, back at Rose Video,
I used to get my assistant

04:21.546 --> 04:23.367
to bring me a bagel every morning.

04:23.581 --> 04:26.650
So I might think a bagel shop is something

04:26.685 --> 04:28.118
this town could use.

04:28.152 --> 04:29.867
Oh, I love a good bagel, Johnny.

04:30.722 --> 04:32.823
Do you-do you think that
idea really has legs?

04:32.857 --> 04:36.126
Well, it's just an example, Bob.

04:36.160 --> 04:38.829
Ooh, I just get chills
thinking that we're sitting

04:38.863 --> 04:42.499
right in the middle of the
"Johnny Rose Dream Factory!"

04:42.534 --> 04:44.301
Ooooh!

04:44.335 --> 04:46.569
Stupid... baby.

04:46.603 --> 04:50.506
I'll tell you what, Johnny,
instead of the license fee,

04:50.541 --> 04:52.304
I'll just take a bite of your muffin.

04:53.211 --> 04:55.045
Mmm! Good!

04:56.916 --> 04:58.750
Mmmm! Mm! Mm!

04:58.848 --> 05:02.016
I have to go to this
Jazzagals rehearsal, Alexis,

05:02.041 --> 05:05.164
so I'll need your word
you'll remain stable.

05:05.789 --> 05:08.132
We're a long way from any hospitals.

05:08.958 --> 05:12.078
You can't be playing fast
and loose with those symptoms.

05:12.634 --> 05:13.976
Alexis?

05:15.617 --> 05:18.671
Alexis?!
- I'm sleeping!

05:20.103 --> 05:21.328
Oh, honey!

05:21.905 --> 05:24.132
Honey, I need to ask
you a serious question.

05:24.374 --> 05:26.976
Has it gotten worse, or are
you just not wearing any makeup?

05:27.010 --> 05:29.211
Your freaking out is not helping anything!

05:29.246 --> 05:30.390
Well, I'm sorry, dear,

05:30.415 --> 05:32.217
but you're the first one to get sick here,

05:32.242 --> 05:33.715
and I-I can't... I don't...

05:33.750 --> 05:35.281
I appreciate your concern,

05:35.418 --> 05:37.953
but it's only a cold, and
I just need to get better.

05:37.988 --> 05:39.062
You're right.

05:39.303 --> 05:41.289
Do I have a fever, though?

05:42.292 --> 05:44.546
- I don't know.
- Can you see?

05:48.031 --> 05:50.432
Hmm. Ugh!

05:51.878 --> 05:53.412
(Sighs)

05:53.437 --> 05:55.882
I think you have to do
it without the tissue.

05:57.087 --> 06:00.256
You're right, okay, put
your hand up on the forehead.

06:00.281 --> 06:02.248
Mom!

06:02.273 --> 06:03.539
(Clears throat nervously)

06:03.945 --> 06:05.453
Oh God!

06:05.478 --> 06:07.258
- (Gasps) It's warm!
- How warm?

06:07.283 --> 06:09.684
I don't know Alexis, I'm not a nurse!

06:09.719 --> 06:12.721
Though I played one once in a
lovely little production of "Harvey,"

06:12.755 --> 06:14.687
but she worked in a mental institute.

06:14.712 --> 06:16.078
(Groans)

06:16.103 --> 06:18.305
I blame those late nights at the barn.

06:18.421 --> 06:19.855
Cold air whistling in and out,

06:19.880 --> 06:23.023
and you and Mutt not
wearing near enough clothing.

06:23.341 --> 06:24.808
Everybody gets sick sometimes.

06:24.833 --> 06:26.531
Speak for yourself!

06:28.537 --> 06:30.604
I'm sorry, Alexis, I'm
sorry I must leave you,

06:30.639 --> 06:33.812
but... mummy's gotta fight for her solo.

06:34.335 --> 06:37.037
Arghhhh! (Sniffles)

06:37.579 --> 06:39.547
(Car rumbles)

06:43.131 --> 06:45.529
No. Nope. No.

06:45.554 --> 06:47.585
- What?
- Well, this can't be it.

06:47.710 --> 06:49.077
That's it.

06:49.102 --> 06:51.592
Can't you tell by how
upscale the boutique is?

06:51.626 --> 06:52.993
Well, that's false advertising!

06:53.027 --> 06:56.228
I've been in this boutique,
and nothing about it is upscale!

06:56.263 --> 06:58.698
How did you being in
this store ever happen?

06:58.732 --> 07:01.078
I was with Roland, we
were shopping for Jocelyn.

07:02.585 --> 07:04.256
It's a long, frightening story.

07:04.281 --> 07:06.014
Anyway, we can't be here, we need to go.

07:06.239 --> 07:07.789
Why? What's the big deal?

07:07.814 --> 07:11.083
There is a solid chance I
may have insulted the owner.

07:11.345 --> 07:13.680
Oh well, that doesn't sound
like something you'd do.

07:13.714 --> 07:15.335
She has very questionable taste.

07:15.810 --> 07:18.445
And I may or may not have
told her that to her face.

07:18.470 --> 07:22.039
So there is no point in being
here, you can start the car.

07:22.064 --> 07:24.832
I didn't drive all the way out
here for you not to do this.

07:25.192 --> 07:27.527
Also, this is probably the only job

07:27.561 --> 07:29.617
in this town that you'll
ever be qualified for.

07:30.185 --> 07:31.653
Okay, so do you want me to lead with that,

07:31.851 --> 07:35.052
or hold it 'til the end,
and keep it as a surprise?

07:38.698 --> 07:40.399
You know, Johnny...

07:42.609 --> 07:46.164
I think you're really on to
something with this bagel idea.

07:47.063 --> 07:49.824
Yeah, but Bob, as I said this morning,

07:49.849 --> 07:51.550
it wasn't so much an idea,

07:51.584 --> 07:54.046
as it was an example of an idea.

07:54.111 --> 07:55.612
I see.

07:55.637 --> 07:59.429
Well, for example, if you
were to open a bagel shop,

07:59.863 --> 08:01.998
what would be the first
thing you'd need to do?

08:02.313 --> 08:04.896
Well offhand, I honestly don't know,

08:04.921 --> 08:07.942
I suppose I'd start by finding a space.

08:07.967 --> 08:10.768
And then I'd probably
source out a bagel oven,

08:10.793 --> 08:14.330
and um, a bagel Baker.

08:14.355 --> 08:17.657
Sesame seeds? Gwen loves
the ones with sesame seeds.

08:17.682 --> 08:19.182
Yeah well, whatever.

08:19.396 --> 08:21.930
And then we get the blueberry cream cheese.

08:21.987 --> 08:23.179
- Ooh!
- Yeah.

08:23.204 --> 08:24.938
Listen Bob, I appreciate your enthusiasm,

08:24.963 --> 08:28.032
but even if this bagel
shop was a viable idea...

08:28.057 --> 08:30.459
- Which I think it is.
- Fair enough.

08:30.484 --> 08:34.437
But you still have...
Considerable overhead.

08:34.462 --> 08:36.496
I mean, you wanna make
sure you're making...

08:36.522 --> 08:39.190
Good bagels the real way.

08:39.215 --> 08:40.783
Well, (Laughs)

08:40.880 --> 08:44.679
You would certainly know how
to make them the real way,

08:44.826 --> 08:48.187
because you're uh... you...

08:49.811 --> 08:52.609
- Jewish?
- I didn't know if I could say it.

08:54.275 --> 08:57.351
But boy, do you all love your bagels!

08:57.851 --> 09:01.562
I mean I do too, and I'm not even uh...

09:04.330 --> 09:06.699
Jewish. You can say it, Bob.

09:06.724 --> 09:09.258
I don't know why,

09:09.283 --> 09:10.968
it feels like a swear.

09:12.039 --> 09:13.372
What's the one you can't say?

09:13.407 --> 09:15.207
Okay, you know what, I've
got a lot of work to do, Bob,

09:15.242 --> 09:17.695
but thanks for stopping by.

09:19.000 --> 09:25.074
Advertise your product or brand here

09:26.485 --> 09:27.986
Wendy: So... David!

09:28.021 --> 09:29.855
This is quite the resume.

09:29.889 --> 09:33.695
If I ever need a performance
artist I know who to call.

09:34.250 --> 09:37.085
- Thank you.
- Skanky!

09:37.764 --> 09:41.232
- Excuse me?
- You called my store skanky

09:41.267 --> 09:43.828
when you were here with the mayor.

09:44.640 --> 09:47.439
Mmm... mmhm.

09:47.473 --> 09:48.840
Hmm.

09:48.875 --> 09:50.876
Well, what I think I'd
bring to the position

09:50.910 --> 09:54.579
is a worldly approach to merchandising,

09:54.613 --> 09:57.481
and sales tactics. We're not
over the skanky thing, are we?

09:57.515 --> 10:00.618
No, and I can't help but wonder,

10:00.652 --> 10:03.320
why you'd wanna work in a
store you described as skanky!

10:03.354 --> 10:05.255
I don't know if we need
to keep saying the word.

10:05.290 --> 10:06.857
Skanky!

10:06.892 --> 10:10.203
Do you still think my
store is skanky, David?

10:13.364 --> 10:14.865
Which is why I feel like I can help.

10:14.900 --> 10:16.400
You think I need your help?!

10:16.434 --> 10:18.569
Well, I am answering an ad in the paper.

10:18.604 --> 10:21.521
Well David, I am looking for a partner.

10:21.546 --> 10:24.274
Someone who believes in my store.

10:24.309 --> 10:27.209
Well, I can say with complete certainty

10:27.234 --> 10:31.247
that I see literally nothing but potential.

10:31.281 --> 10:32.951
In your store, you know?

10:32.992 --> 10:35.515
Is the floor overcrowded? Yeah.

10:36.087 --> 10:37.787
Are the mannequins a little too busty?

10:37.822 --> 10:39.388
Absolutely.

10:39.524 --> 10:41.624
Does it smell like urinal cakes in here?

10:42.085 --> 10:43.159
Perhaps.

10:43.193 --> 10:45.294
Well, this is all very constructive,

10:45.329 --> 10:49.335
and it's clear you have some strong ideas.

10:50.015 --> 10:53.569
Here's the issue: It seems
as though you have trouble

10:53.604 --> 10:55.905
filtering negative thoughts.

10:55.940 --> 11:00.409
So I don't know if I can trust you

11:00.444 --> 11:03.015
to represent the "Blouse Barn."

11:04.181 --> 11:06.215
Okay, well, this has been a treat.

11:06.250 --> 11:07.953
Thank you so much.

11:08.885 --> 11:11.053
I'll need to see you on the floor,

11:11.087 --> 11:13.023
working with customers.

11:14.658 --> 11:15.820
Okay.

11:23.227 --> 11:24.995
(Spoon clinks)

11:27.304 --> 11:29.726
- Can I help you?
- Bob want us to meet.

11:30.750 --> 11:32.585
Bob wants us to meet?!

11:32.619 --> 11:34.953
- Yeah, may I sit?
- No, no.

11:34.987 --> 11:37.356
(Laughs) Hey there, Johnny.

11:37.390 --> 11:38.957
- Bob?
- This is Ivan.

11:38.991 --> 11:40.392
- Uh huh?
- Take a load off.

11:40.427 --> 11:43.406
- Ah.
- Well... sure, sit. Sit down.

11:43.431 --> 11:47.468
Ivan would like to help
with the uh, bagel idea.

11:47.767 --> 11:50.302
Well, there's no bagel
- I mean, you know, Bob,

11:50.337 --> 11:52.507
I already told you... I got some brick.

11:53.273 --> 11:55.406
You've got bricks? What bricks?

11:55.908 --> 11:57.226
- For bagel oven.
- Yeah.

11:57.744 --> 11:59.111
Ivan works down at the quarry,

11:59.145 --> 12:01.579
he's got a whole truck filled with bricks.

12:01.614 --> 12:02.757
Right out front!

12:03.002 --> 12:07.139
Bob, you know, this bagel
shop idea was just an idea.

12:07.486 --> 12:08.854
You know, it's not even an idea,

12:08.888 --> 12:13.812
it's just an illustration
of a theoretical idea.

12:13.837 --> 12:15.148
Well, that may be,

12:15.201 --> 12:19.237
but do you know how
much a bagel oven costs?

12:19.632 --> 12:22.433
And Ivan here, he's
willing to do it for free.

12:22.468 --> 12:25.336
- As long as I get to...
- As long as he gets to make the bagels.

12:25.371 --> 12:28.656
- Yeah.
- Wow, well, no one is making any bagels.

12:28.681 --> 12:30.876
- Right now.
- You want me to start unloading?

12:30.910 --> 12:32.281
No, no unloading.

12:32.306 --> 12:33.979
Ivan, would you excuse us for a minute?

12:34.013 --> 12:36.570
I just wanna have a word with Bob.

12:36.595 --> 12:38.671
- Oh yeah, sure.
- Okay.

12:42.617 --> 12:45.290
Could you stand, and excuse us?

12:45.324 --> 12:46.398
All right, oh, okay.

12:46.423 --> 12:47.789
I'll meet you out there in a minute.

12:47.814 --> 12:51.015
Bob, you know, we are... so f...

12:52.331 --> 12:53.554
Oh.

12:54.487 --> 12:57.590
We are so far from even remotely having

12:57.615 --> 13:01.818
a conversation about
this... You know, business.

13:01.940 --> 13:04.085
Yeah. Okay.

13:04.337 --> 13:06.771
You said you started Rose Video

13:06.796 --> 13:08.898
with $2,000 bucks and a dream.

13:09.254 --> 13:12.722
I-Bob, you-you
don't have to...

13:12.803 --> 13:16.578
Let's turn this dream... Into green!

13:18.099 --> 13:20.039
Bob, I don't want your check.

13:21.443 --> 13:23.944
(Sighs) Oh my God.

13:26.543 --> 13:29.378
(Cars rumble)

13:29.952 --> 13:31.625
(Classical music plays)

13:35.285 --> 13:38.154
- Ooh!
- Do you think I should get it?

13:38.179 --> 13:40.787
Mm! That's a question.

13:40.812 --> 13:42.612
- You don't like it.
- I never said that.

13:42.647 --> 13:46.216
I never said that, I
feel... You know, in France,

13:46.250 --> 13:49.257
they say the looser the fit,
the sexier the feel, so...

13:49.282 --> 13:50.717
I've never been to France.

13:50.742 --> 13:53.077
Okay, what if I pulled a few other options,

13:53.102 --> 13:56.235
and um, see what happens?

13:56.260 --> 13:57.382
I'll be right back.

13:58.195 --> 14:00.730
Hi! How much longer do you expect me

14:00.764 --> 14:02.966
to wait in the car like
some hired chauffeur?!

14:03.000 --> 14:05.046
Um, yeah, I'm gonna need
you to do something for me.

14:05.319 --> 14:06.886
Like drive home without you?

14:06.911 --> 14:10.013
Uh no, Wendy has got me
on a bit of a trial run

14:10.038 --> 14:12.639
with the customers, and I'm
gonna need you to help me out

14:12.664 --> 14:14.232
by looking like you're
enjoying this conversation

14:14.257 --> 14:15.906
a little more than you are,

14:15.931 --> 14:19.210
um, I'm gonna need you to
buy a couple blouses from me.

14:19.499 --> 14:21.890
- A couple?!
- One. A blouse.

14:24.562 --> 14:27.289
- What about this?
- Well, that's not an option.

14:27.323 --> 14:30.468
- That-no. - But I have my
sister's communion this weekend.

14:31.228 --> 14:33.229
- Okay, don't do that.
- Don't do what?

14:33.264 --> 14:34.687
Do you not like it? Don't, Stevie!

14:34.734 --> 14:37.165
Good recommendation, sir!

14:37.200 --> 14:40.179
This is gonna be a smash at
my husband's trial hearing.

14:40.937 --> 14:42.679
He's got good taste.

14:42.704 --> 14:44.772
David: Okay, so I've pulled a few options.

14:44.797 --> 14:46.197
Or we can go with what we have.

14:46.222 --> 14:48.357
- These are stupid.
- Okay.

14:49.360 --> 14:50.760
Moira: Alexis?

14:51.224 --> 14:54.091
The woman at the general
store said a girl in Elmdale

14:54.116 --> 14:56.351
recently contracted avian flu.

14:56.376 --> 14:58.835
So I got you a bit of everything.

14:59.431 --> 15:03.267
Oh... I see you're already
being taken care of.

15:03.292 --> 15:04.421
Hello.

15:04.828 --> 15:07.068
I didn't realize you were
feeling well enough for company.

15:07.355 --> 15:08.955
I just brought over a few things

15:08.980 --> 15:10.500
to help break the fever.

15:10.658 --> 15:13.727
And it's really helping, thank you.

15:14.175 --> 15:16.577
No, I-I'm relieved that Alexis has someone

15:16.602 --> 15:20.004
with such natural care-giving tendencies.

15:21.484 --> 15:24.312
- I'm gonna go.
- No babe, stay.

15:24.975 --> 15:26.710
Had I known your spirits were so high,

15:26.735 --> 15:30.605
I might not have spent the
last 45 minutes of my life

15:30.823 --> 15:33.925
running around buying cold medication.

15:33.950 --> 15:35.884
I didn't ask you to go buy cold medication.

15:35.909 --> 15:38.177
When have you ever bought
me cold medication?!

15:38.202 --> 15:40.773
Exactly, I knew it didn't feel right.

15:42.157 --> 15:44.058
Mutt: I think you're
in good hands now, babe.

15:44.373 --> 15:45.840
- No! -
Uh-huh.

15:45.865 --> 15:48.201
Oh dear, are we sure this
isn't just mono again?

15:48.226 --> 15:50.394
What with your symptoms,
and your lifestyle?

15:50.502 --> 15:52.515
Mrs. Rose, I don't have mono.

15:52.693 --> 15:54.728
Oh no offense dear, could be others.

15:54.753 --> 15:57.854
- Oh my God!
- Get some rest.

15:57.879 --> 16:00.601
- Bye.
- Bye.

16:01.773 --> 16:03.773
Weren't you supposed
to be at choir practice?

16:03.813 --> 16:05.757
Rehearsal. Yes.

16:05.782 --> 16:07.649
I supposed to be there over an hour ago.

16:07.674 --> 16:08.812
So why aren't you?

16:08.837 --> 16:12.773
Because I kept picturing
you diseased and all alone.

16:13.781 --> 16:15.312
That's never stopped you before.

16:15.337 --> 16:16.770
I know!

16:16.917 --> 16:18.718
What the hell is going on, Alexis!

16:19.070 --> 16:22.765
I'm feeling something.
Something debilitating!

16:22.798 --> 16:26.445
You're the ill one, but
I'm... I'm feeling this...

16:27.592 --> 16:30.360
- This...
- Maternal instinct, maybe?

16:30.581 --> 16:33.216
No, that's not it.

16:33.241 --> 16:34.709
No!

16:34.734 --> 16:35.726
Maybe.

16:37.382 --> 16:38.328
No!

16:44.156 --> 16:46.357
Have I offended you in some way, Johnny?

16:46.382 --> 16:47.617
Probably.

16:47.642 --> 16:51.779
I'm just wondering at what
point you decided to cut me out.

16:51.992 --> 16:55.134
- Of what?
- Well, I assumed I would be consulted

16:55.168 --> 16:57.369
before we made any major decisions

16:57.404 --> 16:59.625
- about the bagel business.
- What decisions?!

17:00.109 --> 17:02.607
Well, hiring Ivan for one thing,

17:02.642 --> 17:04.601
I don't have good feeling about that guy.

17:04.626 --> 17:06.515
I think he's ex-KGB.

17:06.752 --> 17:10.265
Roland, there is no bagel business!

17:10.392 --> 17:13.017
Okay, it was just a stupid idea I made up

17:13.051 --> 17:14.853
because you were right.

17:14.877 --> 17:16.877
Well, I know that!

17:17.263 --> 17:18.698
Right about what?

17:18.723 --> 17:20.958
About me not doing anything.

17:21.010 --> 17:23.045
It's tough enough coming
up with a business idea,

17:23.079 --> 17:25.413
let alone a money making
idea in a town this small,

17:25.448 --> 17:29.345
and I was you know, putting
a lot of pressure on myself.

17:29.786 --> 17:31.252
Maybe too much pressure.

17:31.921 --> 17:34.923
And I've been doing nothing
but... treading water.

17:35.834 --> 17:40.846
So I... started rambling
about bagels this morning.

17:41.564 --> 17:43.531
(Sighs)

17:43.566 --> 17:46.601
Look at this, the brain trust!

17:46.635 --> 17:48.836
So I was thinking, and uh,

17:48.870 --> 17:51.244
I'm not married to it, but uh...

17:51.673 --> 17:53.634
"Bob's Bagels."

17:55.410 --> 17:57.377
Johnny, I think you have something

17:57.412 --> 17:59.150
you'd like to say to Bob.

17:59.404 --> 18:01.447
You don't wanna use the name Bob?

18:01.717 --> 18:03.550
Oh, I get it,

18:03.585 --> 18:06.587
go with something a
little more old testament?

18:06.622 --> 18:08.055
Bob that's not it, no.

18:08.090 --> 18:10.400
See, there won't be a bagel shop.

18:10.852 --> 18:12.919
'Cause I've looked into
it, and it's not feasible.

18:13.017 --> 18:15.284
And there already is a
bagel shop in Elmdale.

18:15.396 --> 18:16.764
But Ivan's about to hand in his notice

18:16.798 --> 18:18.775
down at the quarry, and uh...

18:19.234 --> 18:20.667
I gave you that check!

18:20.701 --> 18:23.673
Yes and of course I'm-I'm returning...

18:23.938 --> 18:25.648
This check to you.

18:25.673 --> 18:29.642
Whoa, whoa, hold on a second.
You took money from Bob?

18:30.111 --> 18:33.247
- Why didn't you come to me?
- You would've given me money?

18:33.281 --> 18:35.081
No, of course not, but as your partner...

18:35.116 --> 18:38.033
You're not a partner! Not my partner.

18:38.423 --> 18:41.559
Look Bob, I appreciate all the
confidence you've shown in me.

18:41.584 --> 18:44.119
I really do, and I promise you this:

18:44.144 --> 18:47.980
I will come up with a...
better idea real soon.

18:48.095 --> 18:50.096
You know, next time uh...

18:50.131 --> 18:52.097
I should probably see a business plan

18:52.132 --> 18:57.119
so I don't invest so much
in another uh, hollow scheme.

18:57.389 --> 18:59.924
(Scoffs) Yeah, me too.

18:59.949 --> 19:03.252
- You didn't invest.
- Yes, and whose fault is that?

19:04.983 --> 19:06.337
Mm...

19:07.031 --> 19:08.994
Twyla: Well, congratulations.

19:09.019 --> 19:11.717
Let me get the champagne.
You guys are gonna love it,

19:11.751 --> 19:14.369
it's the same one we use to
celebrate my mom's divorces.

19:15.791 --> 19:18.757
- Great...
- So how long before I can return this?

19:18.792 --> 19:21.611
Oh, it's exchange or store credit only.

19:22.383 --> 19:24.697
- That's funny.
- I'm not joking.

19:26.576 --> 19:28.744
Well, I guess you're buying drinks tonight.

19:28.878 --> 19:30.277
I can do that, that's fair.

19:30.302 --> 19:31.822
And dinner.

19:32.221 --> 19:34.215
- Okay.
- And if I feel like dessert...

19:34.240 --> 19:37.384
It's a $12 dollar negligee
on a 2-for-1 promotion so...

19:39.145 --> 19:40.913
Okay, I'll just drop
a little raisin in here

19:40.947 --> 19:42.314
to release the bubbles.

19:42.348 --> 19:43.916
Blechhh! That's no necessary!

19:43.950 --> 19:45.080
Okay!

19:47.964 --> 19:49.337
Congratulations!

19:50.274 --> 19:52.353
A whole raisin.

19:54.026 --> 19:55.793
To your first job.

19:55.828 --> 19:58.395
Ooh, my first job was actually
a gap kids campaign

19:58.430 --> 19:59.830
when I was six.

20:01.266 --> 20:03.228
- To your first job!
- Mm!

20:03.253 --> 20:04.361
(Clink)

20:14.143 --> 20:15.033
So tired

20:15.058 --> 20:17.041
- Yeah.
- Tell me a story.

20:17.752 --> 20:20.166
- How about a song?
- No!

20:20.630 --> 20:22.173
A story it is.

20:23.111 --> 20:25.079
Um...

20:25.238 --> 20:28.574
There once was a radiant young actress,

20:28.609 --> 20:31.566
who dreamed of having two sons.

20:31.912 --> 20:34.579
The second of which would be named Alex.

20:34.614 --> 20:36.894
- I don't like this story.
- Shh!

20:37.517 --> 20:40.685
Now it seems the vivacious
daytime Emmy nominee

20:40.720 --> 20:43.588
was surprised by how taken she was

20:43.623 --> 20:46.527
with this unanticipated daughter.

20:47.019 --> 20:50.269
Mostly because she didn't cry
as much as the unmannerly son,

20:50.988 --> 20:55.550
but also because she was
adventurous, carefree,

20:56.120 --> 20:57.854
so beautiful.

20:57.879 --> 20:59.433
Just like her mother.

21:04.510 --> 21:07.355
Alexis, you're on my arm.

21:08.380 --> 21:10.394
Alexis, seriously. I can't feel it!

21:10.782 --> 21:12.566
I can't-Alexis!
- Aah!

21:13.083 --> 21:14.417
Go to sleep, dear.

Ray, I have always seen you

21:21.044 --> 21:22.441
as a sensitive,

21:22.466 --> 21:24.299
cultured man of the world.

21:24.324 --> 21:25.175
Thank you.

21:25.200 --> 21:26.500
And I'm sure your family

21:26.525 --> 21:27.991
wanted more for you

21:28.194 --> 21:29.827
when they immigrated from...

21:29.852 --> 21:31.870
- Winnipeg.
- Winnipeg?
