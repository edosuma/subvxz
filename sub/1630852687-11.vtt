18:18.531 --> 18:22.301
So, how did everything go
at the police station?

18:22.301 --> 18:26.606
Well, uh, I told them
they had the wrong guy.

18:26.606 --> 18:29.342
Wow! I‐I would've never guessed
lying to the police

18:29.342 --> 18:31.978
would be where
you would have landed.
Mm‐hmm.

18:31.978 --> 18:33.713
But brava.
Brava is right.

18:33.713 --> 18:35.514
I mean, I admit
that I'm shocked,

18:35.514 --> 18:39.118
but also very happy
you took my advice.

18:39.118 --> 18:43.222
Actually, it was Javi's advice
that made me take your advice.

18:43.222 --> 18:45.224
‐Really?
‐Yeah.

18:45.224 --> 18:46.659
‐Javi?
‐Mm‐hmm.

18:46.659 --> 18:49.395
Conservative‐ass Javi
told you not to ID him?

18:49.395 --> 18:51.530
Oh, no, he told me
to absolutely ID him,

18:51.530 --> 18:53.132
that I had every reason to

18:53.132 --> 18:54.634
and that I should let
the system do its job.

18:54.634 --> 18:56.602
Right.
Which, I'll be honest,
I almost did.

18:56.602 --> 18:59.505
But then, you know, I saw
all these people of color

18:59.505 --> 19:02.274
being processed
in and out of the system.

19:02.274 --> 19:05.311
Mm.
And I thought about
this young kid

19:05.311 --> 19:06.912
just getting caught up
in this machine

19:06.912 --> 19:10.916
where he probably doesn't
stand a chance, and it...

19:10.916 --> 19:12.151
it scared the crap out of me.

19:12.151 --> 19:13.419
Yeah.

19:13.419 --> 19:14.987
Yeah, that makes sense.

19:14.987 --> 19:16.188
‐Really?
‐Mm‐hmm.

19:16.188 --> 19:18.624
Because I'm struggling.

19:18.624 --> 19:21.661
I'm struggling to make sense
of what that means about me

19:21.661 --> 19:24.430
and the system
that I grew up believing in.

19:24.430 --> 19:27.633
Well, it says that
you can believe in a system

19:27.633 --> 19:30.336
and also believe that system
needs improvement.

19:30.336 --> 19:32.505
Yeah, and maybe one day
you'll be in a position

19:32.505 --> 19:34.140
to do something about it.

19:34.140 --> 19:37.343
Okay, calm down, antifa.

19:37.343 --> 19:41.614
When life redirects your path
or knocks you off your axis,

19:41.614 --> 19:43.416
the comfortable thing to do

19:43.416 --> 19:47.086
is remain the same person
you've always been.

19:47.086 --> 19:50.256
But when the catalyst
for change is so powerful

19:50.256 --> 19:53.592
it alters who you are
and what you believe,

19:53.592 --> 19:57.063
the courageous thing to do
is embrace that moment

19:57.063 --> 20:00.299
and use it
as an opportunity to grow.

20:04.070 --> 20:05.738
[ Knock at door ]
Yeah?

20:08.674 --> 20:10.576
So, I know I messed up

20:10.576 --> 20:14.647
by telling everyone about
our night of extraordinary sex.

20:14.647 --> 20:20.152
But I wanted to give you
this gift to apologize.

20:20.152 --> 20:22.655
[ Chuckles ] Oh, my gosh.
Thank you.

20:22.655 --> 20:24.090
Yeah, I figured
it might help protect

20:24.090 --> 20:25.357
that legal brain of yours

20:25.357 --> 20:27.326
the next time you get
onto a scooter.

20:27.326 --> 20:29.762
Or, you know,
the next time we have

20:29.762 --> 20:33.332
tender yet incredibly
athletic sex.

20:35.468 --> 20:37.603
This is really sweet.

20:37.603 --> 20:39.271
Now shut the door.

20:41.474 --> 20:43.309
No, no.
I meant shut the door

20:43.309 --> 20:45.478
and please be on
the other side of it.

20:45.478 --> 20:47.213
Right. Yeah.

20:47.213 --> 20:48.647
Yeah.
