WEBVTT

00:01.987 --> 00:03.570
Hey, guys. Guess
what I got for us.

00:03.622 --> 00:05.739
It's a chore wheel.

00:05.741 --> 00:08.930
It will be a fun way for us
to split up the workload.

00:08.960 --> 00:11.828
Ooh! And I thought
chores were fun before.

00:12.914 --> 00:15.582
Come on, we all
have to pitch in.

00:15.634 --> 00:18.802
Plus, the mall facilities inspector
is visiting all the stores this week.

00:18.837 --> 00:21.638
Everything has to be perfect,
or we can get shut down.

00:21.673 --> 00:22.822
Ooh, I'm gonna spin first.

00:30.565 --> 00:33.483
Clean the bathroom?
What's my prize?

00:33.518 --> 00:37.737
This one-of-a-kind toilet brush!

00:37.773 --> 00:38.938
Yes!

00:41.576 --> 00:44.661
Guess who booked big-time celebrity
guests to come to A&A music factory

00:44.696 --> 00:46.613
to talk and perform for
all of our students.

00:46.665 --> 00:49.783
Sorry, too many words.

00:49.835 --> 00:51.785
Let me start over.

00:51.787 --> 00:54.838
I just got off the phone
with Billie and Bobbie!

00:58.543 --> 01:00.543
Billie and Bobbie from
"Billie and Bobbie show"?

01:00.595 --> 01:02.462
They're, like, my
favorite performers ever.

01:02.514 --> 01:03.763
Hey!

01:03.799 --> 01:05.632
Sorry, they're my
second favorite.

01:05.634 --> 01:07.634
You guys are tied for third.

01:08.970 --> 01:11.638
First is the magician who
performed at my family reunion.

01:11.640 --> 01:13.606
He turned my aunt into a dove.

01:13.642 --> 01:14.858
Never did see her again.

01:17.896 --> 01:20.897
Billie and Bobbie are in town to
do a live taping of their TV show,

01:20.949 --> 01:23.533
and I asked them to stop by
to talk to our students.

01:23.568 --> 01:27.620
I know they're this wholesome family
act, but aren't they a little cheesy?

01:27.656 --> 01:31.491
What's cheesy about a brother-sister
duo that tells knock-knock jokes

01:31.543 --> 01:35.628
and sings folk songs about friendship,
sunshine, and sibling love?

01:35.664 --> 01:37.664
Everything?

01:37.716 --> 01:40.667
But hey, you can't deny how
popular Billie and Bobbie are.

01:40.669 --> 01:43.803
Is Billie the brother
or the sister?

01:43.839 --> 01:45.138
- Sister.
- Brother.

01:45.173 --> 01:47.757
- I thought Billie was the brother.
- Isn't Bobbie the brother?

01:47.809 --> 01:50.593
I know how to find out.
Let's watch the theme song.

01:52.000 --> 01:58.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:08.913 --> 02:10.697
That clears that up.

03:33.782 --> 03:35.615
So wait, Billie is the...
-Still no clue.

03:36.918 --> 03:38.501
Having fun, Lily?

03:38.537 --> 03:41.454
I can't believe I'm this
close to Billie and Bobbie.

03:41.506 --> 03:44.457
Her hair is even
bigger in real life.

03:44.509 --> 03:46.876
- Knock-knock.
- Who's there?

03:46.928 --> 03:48.845
- Canoe.
- Canoe who?

03:48.880 --> 03:52.715
Canoe tell us if there are any
Billie and Bobbie fans in the house?

03:55.937 --> 03:58.555
- Hey, sister.
- Yeah, brother?

03:58.607 --> 04:00.640
You know what I always wanted?

04:00.642 --> 04:02.642
- My golden curls?
- Oh!

04:05.697 --> 04:11.451
No, really, I always wanted
a cherry red sports car.

04:11.486 --> 04:15.822
I asked for one for my 16th birthday,
but mother wouldn't get it for me.

04:15.824 --> 04:18.658
Oh, well, she got you
a cherry red bicycle.

04:18.709 --> 04:21.577
But none of my dates could
fit in that basket.

04:21.630 --> 04:23.746
Oh!

04:23.798 --> 04:26.583
I don't know how much
more of this I can take.

04:26.635 --> 04:29.552
All this cuteness
is making me sick.

04:29.588 --> 04:33.923
Oh, come on. That one
was kind of funny.

04:33.975 --> 04:36.476
- Everyone, dance with us.
- Come on, get up.

04:36.511 --> 04:37.844
Show us some of your best moves.

04:39.814 --> 04:42.849
This is great. Good job, kids.

04:44.736 --> 04:46.603
- Bye.
- Bye now.

04:47.822 --> 04:49.572
- Hello.
- Hello there.

04:54.529 --> 04:58.531
Okay, I rolled my eyes so many
times today, I'm getting dizzy.

04:58.583 --> 05:01.618
There is no way Billie and Bobbie
are that perky in real life.

05:01.670 --> 05:05.705
Hey, Trish. Aren't you
just a bundle of sunshine?

05:07.709 --> 05:10.543
Thank you so much
for having us here.

05:10.545 --> 05:12.595
You're welcome.

05:12.631 --> 05:14.514
Well, hey.

05:14.549 --> 05:16.883
We wanted to invite y'all
to our live TV show taping

05:16.885 --> 05:18.885
at club-a-dub-dub
tomorrow night.

05:18.937 --> 05:21.554
Oh, wow, thanks.

05:21.606 --> 05:24.607
And thank you so much for coming today.
It meant a lot to the kids.

05:24.643 --> 05:26.893
Oh, that's why we
do what we do...

05:26.895 --> 05:29.829
For the kids.

05:29.864 --> 05:32.699
You guys don't talk like
that all the time, do you?

05:32.734 --> 05:34.867
Like what?

05:34.903 --> 05:36.736
Forget it.

05:36.788 --> 05:40.707
Hey, would you two mind showing
us around your music school?

05:40.742 --> 05:43.826
Sure, we'd love to.

05:43.878 --> 05:46.663
Oh, great. Now they've
got you doing it.

05:48.550 --> 05:50.750
So we have a professional
booth for our singers,

05:50.752 --> 05:52.752
- a studio for our dancers...
- Wow.

05:52.754 --> 05:54.754
A brand-new snack
machine for our eaters.

05:54.806 --> 05:57.924
Ooh, do y'all mind
if I grab an apple?

06:01.896 --> 06:04.480
Oh! A rat!

06:04.516 --> 06:07.767
Oh my gosh, oh my gosh,
this is so embarrassing.

06:07.802 --> 06:11.604
I'm so sorry, bi... Bob... bi...

06:11.606 --> 06:13.573
Girlfriend.

06:13.608 --> 06:16.576
Someone must have forgotten
to clean out the machine.

06:16.611 --> 06:18.444
I did clean it out.

06:18.446 --> 06:20.830
Wow, pretty gross, huh?

06:20.865 --> 06:24.617
You must want to yell
or say a bad word.

06:24.619 --> 06:27.754
Oh, no, she just startled me.

06:27.789 --> 06:30.456
Oh. Aww.

06:30.508 --> 06:32.625
We love animals.

06:32.677 --> 06:35.461
Can we keep him?

06:35.463 --> 06:37.680
Uh, sure?

06:37.716 --> 06:39.766
As long as you keep him
away from our school.

06:39.801 --> 06:42.719
We have an inspection coming
up, and rat infestation...

06:42.771 --> 06:44.604
It will get us shut down.

06:44.639 --> 06:47.523
Oh, well, we wouldn't want that.

06:47.559 --> 06:49.776
Say, what's all this over here?

06:49.811 --> 06:51.778
Our one-of-a-kind
instrument carousel.

06:51.813 --> 06:54.530
Well, how neat. Shall we?

06:54.566 --> 06:56.816
And a-one, and a-two...

07:03.875 --> 07:05.858
Gee willikers!

07:05.894 --> 07:08.494
Is that ketchup and mustard?

07:08.496 --> 07:10.663
I don't get it. I
just cleaned those.

07:10.665 --> 07:15.660
I have never in my entire life
been so completely and utterly...

07:15.691 --> 07:16.803
Here we go.

07:16.838 --> 07:18.838
Amused.

07:18.840 --> 07:20.590
Oh, come on!

07:20.642 --> 07:22.508
Oh, no, really. It just...

07:22.560 --> 07:25.845
It take such a creative mind
to think of a prank like this.

07:25.897 --> 07:28.681
Hey, brother, what do you
say we hit the food court

07:28.733 --> 07:30.600
and think of a great use
for these condiments?

07:30.652 --> 07:32.685
Oh, hey, sister, I think
that's a great idea.

07:32.737 --> 07:35.521
- Okay.
- We will see you all at the show.

07:35.573 --> 07:36.823
Bye.

07:36.858 --> 07:38.908
This place is a mess.

07:38.943 --> 07:41.861
Well, at least the floors
are getting cleaned. Look.

07:43.581 --> 07:46.532
Wait, why are there bubbles
coming from the bathroom?

07:46.584 --> 07:49.919
And why are there more rats
coming from the vending machine?

07:49.954 --> 07:52.455
And why is there an angry man

07:52.507 --> 07:55.067
with the mall facilities inspector
badge standing in the doorway?

08:04.939 --> 08:07.773
What in the world
is going on here?

08:07.825 --> 08:09.658
Nothing much.

08:09.744 --> 08:13.029
What in the world is
going on here with you?

08:13.081 --> 08:16.082
I'm talking about this mess.
This place is a disaster.

08:16.117 --> 08:18.617
And what am I stepping in?

08:18.669 --> 08:19.785
That'll be mustard, sir.

08:20.955 --> 08:22.788
Honey dijon, to be exact.

08:22.840 --> 08:27.676
I know this looks bad, but I promise,
we take our jobs here very seriously.

08:27.712 --> 08:29.845
Well, at least some of us
take our jobs seriously.

08:29.881 --> 08:33.304
Others leave soap in the sink and
forget to turn off the water.

08:33.335 --> 08:34.717
I did turn off the water.

08:34.769 --> 08:37.686
- Or forget to clean the instruments.
- I did clean the instruments.

08:37.722 --> 08:39.917
Oh, right, just like Austin
cleaned out the vending machine.

08:39.941 --> 08:42.024
- I did, I swear.
- Enough.

08:42.059 --> 08:46.896
I'm seeing flooding, filth and an
infestation with disgusting rats.

08:46.948 --> 08:50.816
How dare you to talk about
the Ratsteins like that?

08:50.868 --> 08:53.119
And yes, I named
them the Ratsteins.

08:53.154 --> 08:56.822
Bottom line, this music
school is not up to code,

08:56.874 --> 08:58.691
and I have every right
to shut it down.

08:58.726 --> 09:00.743
No, no, Mr. Inspector Man, sir.

09:00.795 --> 09:02.962
Can I call you Mr.
Inspector Man, sir?

09:02.997 --> 09:05.915
My name's Mr. Schxlumbraugh.

09:09.003 --> 09:10.753
Yeah, I'll stick with "sir."

09:10.805 --> 09:12.116
You're gonna have to
give us another chance.

09:12.140 --> 09:15.891
I don't know what's going on around
here, but we can fix it, I promise.

09:17.678 --> 09:19.095
Fine, you have 48 hours.

09:19.147 --> 09:23.682
Get this place in shape, or say
goodbye to your music school.

09:23.684 --> 09:25.017
Oh, oh.

09:25.069 --> 09:26.852
- Mr. Schlep...
- Hey.

09:26.904 --> 09:29.021
Mr. Schlep... Schlepper...

09:37.115 --> 09:39.665
What is going on in here?

09:39.700 --> 09:42.918
Is someone throwing a
bubble party without us?

09:45.089 --> 09:47.706
Uh, I wish.

09:47.758 --> 09:51.093
We're just stuck cleaning
up this mess of soap suds.

09:51.129 --> 09:54.096
Oh, well, you seem frowny.

09:54.132 --> 09:57.716
Ooh, I bet a song about
bubbles will cheer you up.

09:57.718 --> 09:59.101
I really don't think that's...

10:08.029 --> 10:10.813
- Huh, I actually do feel better.
- Huh.

10:10.865 --> 10:14.066
Oh, well, how did
all of this happen?

10:14.118 --> 10:17.069
Our friend Dez used too much
soap cleaning up the bathroom,

10:17.071 --> 10:19.071
and then he left
the sink running.

10:19.073 --> 10:22.708
And Trish didn't clean the instruments
even though she was supposed to.

10:22.743 --> 10:23.959
Huh. Well, that's a shame.

10:23.995 --> 10:26.190
Here you two are working so
hard to make this school shine,

10:26.214 --> 10:28.914
and all those two
do is bumble it up.

10:28.916 --> 10:31.083
Excuse my language.

10:32.753 --> 10:34.720
Wait, no, it's not like that.
It's...

10:34.755 --> 10:37.840
You know what? Maybe it's time
for y'all to rethink your team.

10:37.892 --> 10:39.925
I mean, we think about
our team every day.

10:39.977 --> 10:43.145
That's what makes us Bobbie and
Billie, like baked beans and chili.

10:43.181 --> 10:45.764
Or chocolate and vanilli.

10:51.989 --> 10:54.156
Well, we're a good team too.

10:54.192 --> 10:56.108
Austin and Ally like...

10:56.160 --> 10:57.943
Milk and a cowie.

11:00.781 --> 11:02.948
Hey, you know what? Why
don't you two go out

11:02.950 --> 11:05.000
and enjoy a nice,
leisurely meal?

11:05.036 --> 11:07.703
And we will stay here and
clean this place up for you.

11:07.755 --> 11:11.006
Oh, no. No, no, we could
never ask you to do that.

11:11.042 --> 11:12.875
You guys have a show
to rehearse for.

11:12.927 --> 11:15.878
No, we insist. Cleaning is actually
one of our favorite things to do.

11:15.930 --> 11:18.964
Oh, let me guess. You guys
have a song about it.

11:19.016 --> 11:21.684
Sure do.

11:36.200 --> 11:39.702
- Oh.
- Well, look at y'all hard at work up here.

11:39.737 --> 11:41.820
Oh, you have no idea.

11:41.872 --> 11:45.741
I've been scrubbing out these
instruments for the past 15 minutes.

11:45.793 --> 11:47.710
And I only took two breaks.

11:49.046 --> 11:51.797
Well, you know, it seems
to me like you two are

11:51.832 --> 11:54.833
are the real heart and
soul of this operation,

11:54.835 --> 11:57.169
you know? And you don't even
get your names on the sign.

11:57.221 --> 12:00.723
I don't need my name on the
side to tell me how great I am.

12:00.758 --> 12:03.892
I tell that to myself every
morning in the mirror.

12:03.928 --> 12:08.981
And I'm sure Austin and Ally tell you
how much they appreciate you, too.

12:11.752 --> 12:12.918
Not really.

12:12.954 --> 12:16.021
But you work so hard.

12:17.858 --> 12:20.075
Yeah, I do, don't I?

12:20.111 --> 12:22.911
I clean the bathrooms, teach
the music video class,

12:22.947 --> 12:25.698
provide comic relief with
my oddball observations.

12:25.750 --> 12:28.951
Well, you know, it
is just such a shame

12:29.003 --> 12:31.003
that you two are so
undervalued, you know?

12:31.038 --> 12:33.839
I mean, here you are,
just working for hours...

12:33.874 --> 12:36.875
Or, like, quarters of hours,

12:36.877 --> 12:39.845
and they are off enjoying
a leisurely lunch.

12:39.880 --> 12:41.847
What?

12:41.882 --> 12:43.849
They're supposed to be
downstairs, cleaning.

12:43.884 --> 12:46.051
Oh, no. I mean, they left.

12:46.103 --> 12:48.887
I supposed they just didn't
really feel the need to pitch in.

12:48.889 --> 12:51.023
That is so strange.

12:51.058 --> 12:53.859
They don't seem like the type
who would take all the credit

12:53.894 --> 12:55.894
without doing their
fair share of the work.

12:55.896 --> 12:57.112
Oh.

12:59.116 --> 13:00.816
Those sneaks.

13:00.868 --> 13:03.869
Taking credit without
doing work is my thing.

13:03.904 --> 13:05.904
Well, you know what
makes us feel better

13:05.906 --> 13:08.073
when a couple of egomaniacs take
advantage of our friendship

13:08.075 --> 13:09.825
and treat us like dirt?

13:09.877 --> 13:11.104
Please be a song.
Please be a song.

13:11.128 --> 13:13.078
- A song.
- Yes!

13:13.080 --> 13:16.665
Save it. I prefer to take
a more direct approach.

13:16.717 --> 13:18.967
- Let's go, Dez.
- Oh.

13:19.003 --> 13:20.135
Goodness.

13:22.890 --> 13:24.923
I'd actually love
to hear a song.

13:27.812 --> 13:29.762
- Dez!
- Gotta go.

13:35.903 --> 13:36.935
Please don't.

13:38.989 --> 13:42.074
Well, well, well,
look who it is.

13:42.109 --> 13:43.992
Didn't expect to see
the two of you here.

13:44.028 --> 13:47.112
You didn't? I thought that's
why we came down here.

13:47.114 --> 13:50.783
I can't believe you guys are
just relaxing in the mall

13:50.785 --> 13:53.085
while Dez and I do all the
work in the music factory.

13:53.120 --> 13:55.704
Yeah, why are you slacking?
The school's a mess,

13:55.756 --> 13:57.956
and inspector Schluchsinbruxin's
is coming in two days.

13:57.958 --> 14:00.876
Slacking? We've been
working non-stop.

14:00.928 --> 14:03.679
And besides, the school
wouldn't be a mess

14:03.714 --> 14:05.764
if you guys had done your
chores in the first place.

14:05.800 --> 14:07.015
- We did do our chores.
- Yeah.

14:07.051 --> 14:09.635
And it's about time you
started appreciating us.

14:09.687 --> 14:12.104
We do appreciate you. You
guys are a huge part

14:12.139 --> 14:14.139
of the success of
the music factory.

14:14.141 --> 14:16.058
We couldn't make it without you!

14:16.110 --> 14:17.810
And we appreciate you!

14:17.812 --> 14:19.923
It's inspiring how much you
do for all of our students!

14:19.947 --> 14:22.781
- Well, we love you guys!
- Then why are we all yelling?

14:22.817 --> 14:24.700
I have no idea!

14:26.904 --> 14:30.739
Look, I know things have been crazy,
but we can't turn on each other.

14:30.791 --> 14:32.135
We have to get
everything back in shape

14:32.159 --> 14:34.159
before the inspector comes,
or we'll get shut down.

14:34.161 --> 14:38.046
Yeah, and then you'll lose all your
students to the b&b music factory.

14:38.082 --> 14:39.965
What's the b&b music factory?

14:40.000 --> 14:42.751
The rival school Billie and
Bobbie are opening up.

14:42.803 --> 14:44.670
What the what?

14:44.722 --> 14:47.756
Lily, what are you
talking about?

14:47.808 --> 14:50.008
Well, I'm not sure
exactly what's going on,

14:50.060 --> 14:52.060
but I've heard Billie
and Bobbie say

14:52.096 --> 14:54.179
they've been sabotaging
the A&A music factory

14:54.181 --> 14:56.732
so that the mall inspector
would shut it down

14:56.767 --> 14:59.687
their plan is to open up their own
school and take all your students away.

15:00.855 --> 15:03.021
So you do know exactly
what's going on.

15:03.073 --> 15:04.823
Huh, I guess I do.

15:10.480 --> 15:13.631
I can't believe Billie and
Bobbie would sabotage us...

15:13.683 --> 15:15.549
The condiments, the bubbles,

15:15.601 --> 15:18.269
the pet rats they planted
in the vending machine.

15:18.304 --> 15:22.423
They're so two-faced... But there's
two of them, so they're four-faced!

15:23.693 --> 15:27.662
Their whole act has been a lie... The
smiles, the sparkles, the jazz hands.

15:27.697 --> 15:31.532
I'm starting to wonder if there's
any real jazz in those hands.

15:31.567 --> 15:35.319
Well, we've got to stop them
before they open up their school.

15:35.371 --> 15:37.621
I say we expose them for
the jerks they really are.

15:37.657 --> 15:41.242
We can do it at their
live taping tomorrow,

15:41.244 --> 15:44.295
out them in front of all
of their fans on live TV.

15:44.330 --> 15:47.548
How? Their goody-goody brother
and sister act is so airtight,

15:47.583 --> 15:49.633
there's no way they'd
show their true colors.

15:49.669 --> 15:53.254
Please, no brother and
sister get along that well.

15:53.306 --> 15:56.424
Trust me, I once died my brother's
hair green while he was sleeping.

15:58.311 --> 15:59.477
Why?

15:59.512 --> 16:01.429
I don't need a reason.

16:01.431 --> 16:03.597
Just follow my lead.
I'll get them to crack.

16:03.649 --> 16:05.232
Wait.

16:07.095 --> 16:09.575
When Billie and Bobbie told me
that I have great fashion sense,

16:09.605 --> 16:11.439
was that a lie too?

16:13.659 --> 16:15.609
Eh, who am I kidding?
I always look great.

16:24.203 --> 16:27.204
Hey, um, do you think
my hair is big enough?

16:27.256 --> 16:30.291
I just sort of feel like it could
be bigger right around like...

16:30.343 --> 16:32.543
Here.

16:32.595 --> 16:34.628
Well, look who it is.

16:34.680 --> 16:37.348
It's bi... Bo...

16:37.383 --> 16:39.633
You.

16:39.685 --> 16:42.436
How is it going, ma'am?

16:42.472 --> 16:43.637
- "Ma'am"?
- Yeah.

16:43.639 --> 16:46.190
Oh, wow, that is just so formal.

16:46.225 --> 16:47.669
Why don't you call
me by my first name?

16:47.693 --> 16:50.361
Maybe next time.

16:50.396 --> 16:52.530
So are you ready for
the big live show?

16:52.565 --> 16:55.282
Oh, you betcha. I
always bubble with joy

16:55.318 --> 16:57.368
whenever I get to
perform for my fans.

16:57.403 --> 17:00.154
Oh, do you have fans here too?

17:00.206 --> 17:03.324
'Cause your brother told us that most
people come to the show for him.

17:04.377 --> 17:06.493
What?

17:06.496 --> 17:12.165
Yeah, since he's the star of the show,
he has most of the fans, right?

17:12.167 --> 17:15.636
Oh, who told you he was
the star of the show?

17:15.671 --> 17:17.387
He did.

17:17.423 --> 17:19.223
He said he's the real talent.

17:19.258 --> 17:20.498
You're just kind of his backup.

17:23.346 --> 17:24.595
He said what now?

17:27.349 --> 17:29.183
She said what now?

17:29.185 --> 17:31.602
Oh, yeah. She told us
this whole duo act

17:31.654 --> 17:34.488
is just a stepping stone for
her to launch her solo career.

17:34.524 --> 17:37.324
And then she went on and on
about your terrible singing.

17:37.360 --> 17:39.193
What did she compare
it to again?

17:39.245 --> 17:42.496
Oh, right. Two seals
having a slap fight.

17:48.371 --> 17:51.255
And I don't even want to tell you
what he said about your dancing...

17:51.290 --> 17:54.208
But I will tell you. He said

17:54.260 --> 17:56.460
it's an embarrassment
to your family.

17:59.348 --> 18:06.387
Why, that no-good, cherry picking, sack
of marshmallows! Excuse my language.

18:06.389 --> 18:09.523
You know what? Fine. I'm gonna go over
there and give her a piece of my mind.

18:09.559 --> 18:12.193
Oh, sounds like it
might have to wait.

18:12.228 --> 18:14.308
The show is about to start.
You need to get on stage.

18:42.475 --> 18:43.475
Whoo!

18:44.594 --> 18:47.261
Well, I guess we
know who's who now.

18:48.598 --> 18:50.181
Knock-knock.

18:54.570 --> 18:56.320
Well, I said, "knock-knock."

18:56.355 --> 18:59.490
Yeah, how about you get the door?
I'm sick of answering it.

18:59.525 --> 19:01.525
Fine! I will answer it!

19:04.280 --> 19:06.580
Knock-knock. Who's there?

19:06.616 --> 19:09.366
Canoe. Canoe who?

19:09.418 --> 19:14.455
Canoe believe that this guy said
that he's a better dancer than me?

19:15.591 --> 19:17.258
All right, you know what?

19:17.293 --> 19:19.460
Everybody knows that
I'm the better singer.

19:19.462 --> 19:21.345
"Happy song." Hit it!

19:42.451 --> 19:44.285
This isn't how it goes.

19:44.320 --> 19:46.487
You know, I like
this version better.

19:54.213 --> 19:56.630
All right, you know what? Stop.
I can't do this anymore.

19:56.666 --> 19:59.333
You think you can do all
of this without me?

19:59.335 --> 20:01.335
Well, then good luck,
because you know what?

20:01.387 --> 20:03.170
- I quit!
- Oh, you quit?

20:03.222 --> 20:05.256
- Well, you can't quit, 'cause I quit!
- Good.

20:05.308 --> 20:05.731
Yeah.

20:05.762 --> 20:07.452
And you can forget about
our little music school

20:07.476 --> 20:10.205
that we were gonna open up, because I
never want to work with you again!

20:10.229 --> 20:12.229
- Well, I never want to even see you again!
- Good!

20:12.265 --> 20:13.314
- Good.
- Grr!

20:13.349 --> 20:14.349
Grr!

20:16.602 --> 20:20.271
Wow, that blew up
quicker than I thought.

20:20.323 --> 20:21.689
Our plan worked.

20:21.700 --> 20:24.580
And now we don't have to worry about
them trying to take down our school.

20:24.610 --> 20:28.662
Does anyone care that there's a live
show going on and no one to perform?

20:28.698 --> 20:31.198
I think it'll be fine.

20:49.719 --> 20:51.552
I gotta say, this
place looks great.

20:51.604 --> 20:55.389
Oh, thank you so much, Mr.
Schluxenberger.

20:55.391 --> 20:57.391
It's Schxlumbraugh.

20:58.694 --> 21:00.527
Why is it so hard for
everyone to say?

21:00.563 --> 21:03.197
It rhymes with Fluxumbraugh.

21:04.335 --> 21:06.255
Anyway, you've officially
passed your inspection,

21:06.285 --> 21:08.202
and you won't be
getting shut down.

21:08.237 --> 21:09.486
Yes!

21:09.538 --> 21:12.239
Hey, can I get a copy of
that report for my parents?

21:12.291 --> 21:14.208
I don't pass tests often.

21:14.243 --> 21:15.542
Sure.

21:15.578 --> 21:17.411
Well, if there's nothing else...

21:17.413 --> 21:19.330
No. Thanks again, Mr.
Schlutzen-blutzen.

21:20.499 --> 21:22.416
Mr. Schluhsen-bluhs...

21:22.418 --> 21:23.584
Mr. Shoshenblux...

21:27.340 --> 21:30.424
Oh, well, if it isn't
Billie and Bobbie.

21:30.476 --> 21:32.393
And Bobbie and Billie.

21:33.596 --> 21:35.262
Hi.

21:35.314 --> 21:36.680
We came to say that we're sorry.

21:36.732 --> 21:41.268
Mother said that we had to get right
down here and offer you an apology pie.

21:42.488 --> 21:44.488
Did you bring any
I'm-sorry ice cream?

21:44.523 --> 21:46.490
I like my apologies a la mode.

21:47.743 --> 21:49.243
No?

21:52.581 --> 21:54.365
We acted like jerks.

21:54.417 --> 21:56.595
You know, we just saw everything
y'all had going for you here,

21:56.619 --> 21:58.669
and I guess we wanted
it for ourselves.

21:58.704 --> 22:00.504
Oh, you can have Dez.

22:01.305 --> 22:04.305
Oh... no, thank you.

22:08.115 --> 22:14.453
Hey, um, before we go, we
have a question for you

22:14.454 --> 22:15.720
and it's just a little
bit embarrassing.

22:15.721 --> 22:18.041
It's just it's been bugging
us since, uh, we met.

22:18.125 --> 22:24.126
Which one of you is Austin and
which one of you is Ally?

22:24.464 --> 22:27.366
Seriously?
