WEBVTT

01:58.205 --> 01:59.902
REID: SOMETHING WRONG?

01:59.945 --> 02:01.295
OH, IT'’S MY MOM.

02:01.338 --> 02:03.297
A PIPE BURST LAST NIGHT,

02:03.340 --> 02:05.299
AND NOW HER LIVING ROOM
IS FLOODED.

02:05.342 --> 02:06.561
UGH.

02:06.604 --> 02:09.172
YEAH. REPAIRS ARE GONNA
TAKE 3 WEEKS MINIMUM,

02:09.216 --> 02:11.000
AND SHE HAS ASKED
TO STAY WITH ME.

02:11.043 --> 02:13.350
THAT'’S GOOD, RIGHT?
I MEAN, OUT OF ALL
THE PEOPLE IN HER LIFE,

02:13.394 --> 02:14.482
YOU'’RE THE ONE
THAT SHE CHOSE TO--

02:14.525 --> 02:16.440
YEAH, I WAS HER
ONLY OPTION, SPENCE.

02:16.484 --> 02:17.572
AH.

02:17.615 --> 02:20.009
TRUST ME, SHE WOULD
MUCH RATHER

02:20.052 --> 02:22.925
RENT SOMETHING ON HER OWN
CLOSER TO HOME,

02:22.968 --> 02:25.188
BUT APPARENTLY MONEY'’S
A LITTLE TIGHT.

02:25.232 --> 02:27.799
I KNOW OUR RELATIONSHIP
HASN'’T ALWAYS BEEN
SMOOTH SAILING,

02:27.843 --> 02:31.716
BUT I DON'’T KNOW, MAYBE
THIS TIME IT'’LL BE DIFFERENT.

02:31.760 --> 02:33.544
MAYBE IT WILL.

02:33.588 --> 02:34.937
DIDN'’T YOU TELL ME
YOUR HOUSE IS HAVING

02:34.980 --> 02:36.243
A TOP-TO-BOTTOM
PAINT JOB THIS WEEK?

02:36.286 --> 02:38.027
MM-HMM.
AS OF THIS MORNING.

02:38.070 --> 02:39.550
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?

02:39.594 --> 02:42.031
WELL, WILL TOOK
THE BOYS TO FLORIDA
FOR A COUPLE DAYS.

02:42.074 --> 02:44.164
I JUST RENTED
A HOTEL ROOM IN THE CITY.

02:44.207 --> 02:47.254
OOH, I GUESS I BETTER UPGRADE
TO THAT JUNIOR SUITE NOW, HUH?

02:47.297 --> 02:48.690
LET ME KNOW IF
YOU NEED ANYTHING--

02:48.733 --> 02:51.083
BOOKS, FOOD,
SHOULDER TO CRY ON.

02:51.127 --> 02:52.911
MMM. WHAT WAS
THAT LAST ONE?

02:54.348 --> 02:57.177
ALL RIGHT, JUST PLEASE
KEEP YOUR PHONE HANDY.

02:59.744 --> 03:01.050
SIMMONS: WHAT DO WE HAVE?

03:01.093 --> 03:02.834
GARCIA: LAST NIGHT
3 10-YEAR-OLD KIDS

03:02.878 --> 03:05.185
WENT MISSING FROM
THEIR HOMES IN
WESSER, IOWA.

03:05.228 --> 03:07.317
THE PARENTS DIDN'’T NOTICE
THEY WERE GONE UNTIL THEY
WOKE UP THIS MORNING.

03:07.361 --> 03:09.928
ALVEZ: WELL, ALL
OF THE FAMILIES SLEPT
THROUGH THE ABDUCTIONS.

03:09.972 --> 03:11.452
THERE MUST NOT HAVE
BEEN MUCH OF A STRUGGLE.

03:11.495 --> 03:13.367
NO SIGNS OF FORCED
ENTRY, EITHER.

03:13.410 --> 03:14.716
NEIGHBORS DIDN'’T
HEAR A SOUND.

03:14.759 --> 03:16.239
LEWIS: LOOK, I'’M NOT
MINIMIZING THIS,

03:16.283 --> 03:18.372
BUT IS IT POSSIBLE
THIS WASN'’T AN
ABDUCTION AT ALL?

03:18.415 --> 03:19.938
I MEAN, GROUP OF
10-YEAR-OLDS,

03:19.982 --> 03:21.418
TIP-TOE EXIT IN
THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT.

03:21.462 --> 03:22.767
SHE'’S GOT A GOOD POINT.

03:22.811 --> 03:23.942
I MEAN, WHAT IF
THE KIDS JUST MADE
A BAD DECISION

03:23.986 --> 03:25.292
TO SNEAK OUT ON A BIG
ADVENTURE TOGETHER?

03:25.335 --> 03:26.945
PRENTISS: I WAS WONDERING
THAT MYSELF,

03:26.989 --> 03:29.209
BUT IT WAS NEARLY
FREEZING LAST NIGHT,

03:29.252 --> 03:31.950
AND IT APPEARS ALL
THE KIDS LEFT WEARING
THEIR PAJAMAS.

03:31.994 --> 03:33.909
NONE OF THEM TOOK
ANY CLOTHING OR FOOD.

03:33.952 --> 03:35.215
SIMMONS: MAYBE IT'’S
A STRAIGHT-UP KIDNAPPING.

03:35.258 --> 03:36.912
THE RANSOM DEMANDS
COULD BE ON THEIR WAY.

03:36.955 --> 03:39.131
PRENTISS: JJ HAS SOME
PERSONAL BUSINESS
TO ATTEND TO HERE,

03:39.175 --> 03:40.829
BUT SHE WILL BE
CONSULTING BY PHONE.

03:40.872 --> 03:42.744
FOR THE REST OF US,
WHEELS UP.

03:50.795 --> 03:53.189
OH, NO.

03:53.233 --> 03:55.235
GUYS, GUYS, GUYS.
THERE'’S SOMETHING THAT
JUST CAME IN.

03:55.278 --> 03:56.584
YOU NEED TO SEE IT.

03:56.627 --> 03:58.499
IT'’S FROM WESSER P.D.
IT'’S SURVEILLANCE FOOTAGE

03:58.542 --> 04:00.109
FROM A NEIGHBORHOOD PARK.

04:03.721 --> 04:05.680
ALVEZ: THOSE ARE THE KIDS.

04:07.464 --> 04:09.336
WHAT THE HELL
IS GOING ON?

04:11.947 --> 04:13.557
GARCIA, CAN YOU
ZOOM IN ON THAT,
PLEASE?

05:15.967 --> 05:18.666
ROSSI: "THERE IS ALWAYS
ONE MOMENT IN CHILDHOOD

05:18.709 --> 05:22.713
WHEN THE DOOR OPENS
AND LETS THE FUTURE IN."

05:22.757 --> 05:24.889
GRAHAM GREENE.

05:26.326 --> 05:27.762
40 YEARS IN
LAW ENFORCEMENT,

05:27.805 --> 05:29.590
I'’VE NEVER SEEN
AN ABDUCTION LIKE THIS.

05:29.633 --> 05:31.896
THE CHILDREN APPEAR
TO BE COMPLICIT.

05:31.940 --> 05:34.203
I MEAN, THEY WENT TO
THE UNSUB VOLUNTARILY.

05:34.246 --> 05:36.031
REID: YEAH, BUT WATCH
THE LAST CHILD'’S FACE.

05:36.074 --> 05:38.773
IT'’S LIKE HE SENSES
SOMETHING WRONG
AT THE LAST MOMENT.

05:38.816 --> 05:40.644
THERE'’S STILL
NO RANSOM DEMAND.

05:40.688 --> 05:42.211
THAT PLUS THE TAPE,

05:42.254 --> 05:44.126
THIS IS LOOKING LESS
AND LESS LIKE A KIDNAPPING.

05:44.169 --> 05:46.650
NORMALLY I'’D THINK THIS
WAS A SEX OFFENDER,

05:46.694 --> 05:49.871
BUT PEDOPHILES ALMOST
NEVER ABDUCT MORE THAN
ONE CHILD AT A TIME.

05:49.914 --> 05:53.048
IF FOR NO OTHER REASON
THAN IT'’S HARD TO CONTROL
MULTIPLE VICTIMS.

05:53.091 --> 05:54.397
I DON'’T KNOW.
THE KIDS ON THE SWING SET

05:54.441 --> 05:56.225
LOOKED PRETTY DAMN CONTROLLED.

05:56.268 --> 05:59.968
MAYBE THEY WERE
DRUGGED SOMEHOW
EARLIER.

06:00.011 --> 06:01.143
WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT
THESE KIDS?

06:01.186 --> 06:02.579
SIMMONS: THEY WERE ALL
GOOD STUDENTS,

06:02.623 --> 06:05.277
STABLE HOMES,
NO BEHAVIORAL ISSUES AT ALL.

06:05.321 --> 06:07.497
PRENTISS: WHEN WE LAND, I'’LL
COORDINATE WITH AGENT CHANNING

06:07.541 --> 06:10.413
WHO'’S ALREADY ON THE GROUND
WITH HER CHILD ABDUCTION
RAPID DEPLOYMENT TEAM.

06:10.457 --> 06:13.155
THE REST OF YOU PAIR UP,
GO TO THE CHILDREN'’S HOMES,

06:13.198 --> 06:14.286
TALK TO THEIR PARENTS.

06:14.330 --> 06:15.766
WE NEED TO GET A SENSE
OF THESE KIDS.

06:15.810 --> 06:19.117
SOMEONE OR SOMETHING
GOT AHOLD OF THEM.

06:19.161 --> 06:21.032
WE NEED TO FIND OUT WHAT.

06:22.338 --> 06:24.340
PRENTISS: OK, CATCH ME
UP, AGENT CHANNING.

06:24.384 --> 06:26.255
WE'’VE GOT LOCAL P.D.
CANVASSING THE NEIGHBORHOOD

06:26.298 --> 06:27.778
LOOKING FOR HOME
SURVEILLANCE CAMERAS.

06:27.822 --> 06:30.520
GOOD. WE'’LL SET UP
MONITORS HERE FOR VIEWING.

06:30.564 --> 06:31.608
OUR CARD TEAM HAS
HANDLED HUNDREDS

06:31.652 --> 06:33.131
OF CHILD ABDUCTION CASES.

06:33.175 --> 06:34.437
BUT SOMETHING LIKE THIS,

06:34.481 --> 06:36.787
WE'’RE IN UNCHARTED
TERRITORY.

06:38.180 --> 06:39.442
HAVE YOU MET
THE MAYOR YET?

06:39.486 --> 06:40.965
NO.BUCKLE UP.

06:44.316 --> 06:46.580
ARE YOU THE OTHER
FBI PERSON?

06:46.623 --> 06:48.320
SSA PRENTISS.

06:48.364 --> 06:49.626
I UNDERSTAND
YOU'’RE THE MAYOR.

06:49.670 --> 06:50.932
ROB TREMAINE.

06:50.975 --> 06:52.629
CAN SOMEONE PLEASE TELL ME
WHAT'’S BEING DONE

06:52.673 --> 06:53.804
TO GET TO THE BOTTOM OF THIS?

06:53.848 --> 06:56.416
OUR BAU TEAM IS
IN PLACE, MAYOR,

06:56.459 --> 06:57.982
AND WE'’RE VERY GOOD
AT WHAT WE DO.

06:58.026 --> 06:59.244
I'’M TALKING ABOUT
SPECIFICS.

06:59.288 --> 07:00.811
WHAT SPECIFICALLY
ARE YOU DOING?

07:00.855 --> 07:03.640
HONEY, I'’M GOING HOME
WITH TIMMY.

07:03.684 --> 07:05.990
TAKE A DEEP BREATH.

07:08.515 --> 07:11.996
LOOK, I'’M SORRY.
I DON'’T MEAN TO
COME ON STRONG,

07:12.040 --> 07:13.171
BUT A THING LIKE THIS.

07:13.215 --> 07:14.608
I UNDERSTAND.

07:14.651 --> 07:17.480
BUT IT IS IMPORTANT
FOR YOU TO PRESENT A CALM

07:17.524 --> 07:19.830
AND CONFIDENT FACE
TO YOUR COMMUNITY
RIGHT NOW.

07:19.874 --> 07:21.397
WELL, THAT'’S EASIER
SAID THAN DONE.

07:21.441 --> 07:23.355
3 KIDS IN ONE NIGHT?

07:23.399 --> 07:26.271
HOW DO WE KNOW THAT
THIS MANIAC ISN'’T
GOING TO TAKE MORE?

07:26.315 --> 07:28.665
WE DON'’T.

07:28.709 --> 07:31.494
[INDISTINCT POLICE RADIO
TRANSMISSIONS]

07:31.538 --> 07:33.714
THIS CAN'’T
BE HAPPENING.

07:33.757 --> 07:37.065
IT'’S LIKE A NIGHTMARE
AND I CAN'’T WAKE UP.

07:39.197 --> 07:41.896
ROSSI: YOUR SON WAS
PLUGGED IN.

07:41.939 --> 07:44.942
JOEY'’S ADDICTED
TO HIS SCREENS.

07:44.986 --> 07:47.728
I HAVE KIDS MYSELF.
I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN.

07:47.771 --> 07:50.818
DID YOUR SON MAKE THIS?

07:50.861 --> 07:55.300
YES. HE LOVED
DOING PAPIER-MACHE.

07:55.344 --> 07:56.911
IT'’S PRACTICALLY
THE ONLY THING

07:56.954 --> 07:59.653
THAT COULD TEAR HIM AWAY
FROM HIS ELECTRONICS.

07:59.696 --> 08:04.527
DO YOU THINK
THAT THIS IS HOW
THIS PERSON GOT JOEY,

08:04.571 --> 08:06.660
LIKE A CHAT ROOM
OR SOMETHING?

08:06.703 --> 08:09.706
WE'’LL KNOW MORE ONCE WE
HAVE A CHANCE TO LOOK
AT HIS COMPUTER.

08:09.750 --> 08:13.362
'’CAUSE WE MONITORED
HIS ONLINE ACTIVITY
AS BEST WE COULD.

08:13.405 --> 08:16.234
WE PUT IN FILTERS,
SAFEGUARDS.

08:16.278 --> 08:17.888
BUT JOEY AND HIS FRIENDS,

08:17.932 --> 08:20.848
THEY KNOW HOW TO GET
AROUND ALL OF IT.

08:20.891 --> 08:22.545
OH, GOD.

08:22.589 --> 08:26.984
THIS CYBER STUFF,
IT'’S THEIR WORLD,
NOT OURS.

08:33.034 --> 08:36.080
PRENTISS: SO WHY THESE
KIDS AND WHY NOW?

08:36.124 --> 08:38.387
THE BEHAVIOR IN THE VIDEO,
IT APPEARS AS THOUGH
THEY'’RE RESPONDING

08:38.430 --> 08:40.215
TO A POST-HYPNOTIC
SUGGESTION.

08:40.258 --> 08:42.739
IF TRUE, THAT'’S
AN AWFULLY ELABORATE RUSE.

08:42.783 --> 08:44.219
THE SEEDS FOR THIS
ABDUCTION MUST HAVE BEEN

08:44.262 --> 08:45.742
PLANTED A LONG TIME AGO.

08:45.786 --> 08:47.788
BUT THE PARENTS HAVE
CONFIRMED THAT THESE KIDS

08:47.831 --> 08:49.224
DIDN'’T REALLY KNOW
ONE ANOTHER.

08:49.267 --> 08:50.921
THEY WENT
TO DIFFERENT SCHOOLS.

08:50.965 --> 08:52.096
THEY DIDN'’T HANG OUT
SOCIALLY.

08:52.140 --> 08:53.228
SO WHERE'’S THE OVERLAP?

08:53.271 --> 08:54.664
MAYBE THERE ISN'’T ANY.

08:54.708 --> 08:56.100
I MEAN, THEY COULD HAVE BEEN
SELECTED RANDOMLY ONLINE.

08:56.144 --> 08:57.580
EXCEPT IF THIS IS
A FORM OF HYPNOSIS,

08:57.624 --> 08:58.886
THE UNSUB WOULD NEED TO KNOW

08:58.929 --> 09:00.191
THAT THE CHILDREN ARE
SUSCEPTIBLE TO SUGGESTION.

09:01.628 --> 09:02.846
YOU'’RE ON SPEAKER,
GARCIA.

09:02.890 --> 09:03.760
GARCIA, ON TELEPHONE:
OK, I'’VE GONE THROUGH

09:03.804 --> 09:05.370
THE REGISTERED
SEX OFFENDERS

09:05.414 --> 09:08.025
IN A 50-MILE RADIUS
OF WESSER.

09:08.069 --> 09:10.550
AND AT THE CONCLUSION
OF THIS PHONE CALL,

09:10.593 --> 09:12.595
I AM GOING TO TAKE 3,
MAYBE 4, SHOWERS,

09:12.639 --> 09:13.988
SCRUB MYSELF
WITH STEEL WOOL,

09:14.031 --> 09:15.206
DURING WHICH TIME
I'’M GONNA TENT THE OFFICE,

09:15.250 --> 09:16.599
FUMIGATE IT, AND
WHEN IT CLEARS OUT,

09:16.643 --> 09:17.600
I'’M GONNA FILL
IT WITH KITTENS.

09:17.644 --> 09:18.775
YOU FIND ANYTHING?

09:18.819 --> 09:19.994
HIS NAME IS ARTHUR BRODIE.

09:20.037 --> 09:21.299
WHAT ABOUT HIM?

09:21.343 --> 09:23.693
50 YEARS OLD.
HE'’S GOT A LONG RAP SHEET

09:23.737 --> 09:24.955
OF SEXUAL DEVIANCY,

09:24.999 --> 09:27.697
INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO VOYEURISM,

09:27.741 --> 09:30.221
INDECENT EXPOSURE,
POSSESSION OF CHILD
PORNOGRAPHY,

09:30.265 --> 09:33.485
THE STEALING OF YOUNG
WOMEN'’S UNDERGARMENTS.

09:33.529 --> 09:35.487
I'’M DEFINITELY GONNA
NEED 4 SHOWERS.

09:35.531 --> 09:37.707
WHY DID BRODIE POP OUT
MORE THAN ANY OTHERS?

09:37.751 --> 09:40.275
WELL, THING ONE IS
HE WAS RELEASED A MONTH AGO

09:40.318 --> 09:43.234
AFTER SERVING
A 12-YEAR SENTENCE
FOR STATUTORY RAPE.

09:43.278 --> 09:45.628
THING TWO, HE OWNS
A WHITE VAN

09:45.672 --> 09:48.326
THAT IS EERILY LIKE
THE ONE FROM THE
SURVEILLANCE VIDEO.

09:48.370 --> 09:49.632
REID: DOES BRODIE
LIVE IN TOWN?

09:49.676 --> 09:51.242
YES. HE LIVES
WITH HIS MOM.

09:51.286 --> 09:55.246
HE WORKS THE GRAVEYARD SHIFT
AT AN ASSEMBLY PLANT IN TOWN.

09:55.290 --> 09:57.205
AND IF YOU'’D LIKE
ANOTHER POP FOR THIS WEASEL,

09:57.248 --> 09:59.163
LAST NIGHT WHEN THE
KIDS WENT MISSING,

09:59.207 --> 10:02.079
GUESS WHICH BRA THIEF
CALLED IN SICK TO WORK.

10:11.872 --> 10:13.613
CHILD: LET ME OUT!

10:13.656 --> 10:16.528
LET ME OUT!
PLEASE, LET ME OUT!

10:18.574 --> 10:20.620
LET ME OUT!CHILD 2: LET ME OUT! PLEASE!

10:32.109 --> 10:34.372
I DON'’T WANT TO DIE.

10:34.416 --> 10:39.116
DON'’T WORRY.
WE'’RE GONNA GET
OUT OF HERE.

10:50.911 --> 10:52.216
REID: ARTHUR BRODIE?

10:52.260 --> 10:54.915
FBI. YOUR MOTHER
TOLD US WE MIGHT
FIND YOU HERE.

10:54.958 --> 10:56.264
WHAT'’S THE PROBLEM?

10:56.307 --> 10:57.569
I'’M MINDING
MY OWN BUSINESS.

10:57.613 --> 11:01.225
YOU MINDING YOUR
BUSINESS OR THEIRS?

11:01.269 --> 11:05.839
HEH. "ASSEMBLY AND
MAINTENANCE OF YOUR CORVELL
350 VACUUM CLEANER."

11:05.882 --> 11:07.101
COME ON, BRODIE.

11:07.144 --> 11:08.232
YOU WANT TO PRETEND
YOU'’RE HERE TO READ,

11:08.276 --> 11:09.712
YOU GOT TO DO
BETTER THAN THAT.

11:09.756 --> 11:11.366
THAT YOUR WHITE VAN
PARKED OVER THERE?

11:11.409 --> 11:13.063
YOU CAN'’T TOUCH IT
WITHOUT A WARRANT.

11:13.107 --> 11:14.238
I'’VE GOT MY RIGHTS.

11:14.282 --> 11:16.066
YES, WE CAN.
AND NO, YOU DON'’T.

11:16.110 --> 11:17.720
YOU'’RE ON PAROLE.
THAT'’S ALL THE
WARRANT WE NEED.

11:17.764 --> 11:19.156
THE HELL WITH YOU PEOPLE.

11:19.200 --> 11:21.376
WE'’RE NOT DONE YET.

11:22.725 --> 11:24.640
AHH!

11:28.644 --> 11:30.690
NOW WE'’RE DONE.

11:32.953 --> 11:34.955
JAREAU: ALL RIGHT,
MOM, HERE WE ARE.

11:34.998 --> 11:38.045
ALL THESE YEARS,
I CAN'’T BELIEVE

11:38.088 --> 11:40.134
THIS IS THE FIRST
TIME I'’VE SEEN
WHERE YOU WORK.

11:40.177 --> 11:42.353
WOW. HA HA!

11:42.397 --> 11:44.878
YOU'’RE SURE YOU DON'T
WANT ME TO TAKE YOU
TO THE MALL?

11:44.921 --> 11:46.749
YOU COULD SHOP,
WATCH A MOVIE.

11:46.793 --> 11:49.099
NO, RIGHT HERE'’S FINE.

11:49.143 --> 11:51.493
YOU JUST DO WHAT
YOU NEED TO DO,
AND I WILL SIT HERE,

11:51.536 --> 11:53.321
QUIET AS A MOUSE.

11:53.364 --> 11:54.757
OK.

11:55.976 --> 11:57.455
OH.

11:59.153 --> 12:00.763
DON'’T.

12:00.807 --> 12:02.896
OK, UH, HEH!

12:02.939 --> 12:05.289
I'’M SORRY.
I WAS JUST--

12:05.333 --> 12:07.248
DON'’T LOOK IN THE FILES.

12:07.291 --> 12:12.296
IT CAN BE DIFFICULT
TO PROCESS...OK?

12:12.340 --> 12:14.255
OK. SORRY.

12:14.298 --> 12:15.952
IT'’S OK.

12:18.912 --> 12:21.262
OK.

12:21.305 --> 12:23.612
YOU KNOW WHAT I
THOUGHT MIGHT BE FUN?

12:23.655 --> 12:28.269
THE TWO OF US TAKE
A DRIVE OUT TO
OCEAN CITY THIS WEEKEND.

12:28.312 --> 12:31.228
I'’M CONSULTING ON
AN ACTIVE CASE, MOM,

12:31.272 --> 12:35.145
SO UNTIL WE CLOSE IT,
THERE ARE NO WEEKENDS.

12:35.189 --> 12:36.799
I HAVEN'’T BEEN TO
OCEAN CITY

12:36.843 --> 12:40.107
SINCE YOU AND ROZ WERE
JUST LITTLE THINGS.

12:40.150 --> 12:42.718
THAT'’S WHERE YOUR DAD
AND I TOOK YOU GIRLS

12:42.762 --> 12:45.373
TO HAVE LOBSTER
FOR THE FIRST TIME,
REMEMBER?

12:45.416 --> 12:47.070
NO, NOT REALLY.

12:48.463 --> 12:49.812
YEAH, FUNNIEST THING.

12:49.856 --> 12:51.988
THE LOBSTERS WERE
IN A TANK OUT FRONT

12:52.032 --> 12:55.035
SO THE CUSTOMERS COULD
PICK THE ONE THEY WANTED,

12:55.078 --> 13:01.084
BUT WHEN THE MAN
REACHED IN TO GRAB
THE ONE YOU PICKED...

13:01.128 --> 13:02.694
WHAT?

13:02.738 --> 13:05.872
WELL, IT HIT YOU THAT
THAT POOR FISH

13:05.915 --> 13:07.612
WAS ABOUT TO GO
GET COOKED.

13:07.656 --> 13:11.660
SO YOU TOLD THAT MAN
TO PUT IT RIGHT BACK
WHERE IT WAS,

13:11.703 --> 13:14.402
AND WE HAD TO ORDER
YOU A HOT DOG INSTEAD.

13:14.445 --> 13:17.579
THAT'’S FUNNY,
I REALLY--I DON'’T
REMEMBER THAT AT ALL.

13:17.622 --> 13:21.539
WELL, I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN
YOU WERE GONNA BE AN FBI AGENT.

13:21.583 --> 13:25.108
EVEN BACK THEN, YOU WERE
ALL ABOUT SAVING LIVES.

13:29.069 --> 13:31.027
ROSSI: WHAT'’S THAT
ABRASION ON HIS FOREHEAD?

13:31.071 --> 13:33.638
PRENTISS:
APPARENTLY HE GAVE
LEWIS A SHOVE

13:33.682 --> 13:36.076
AND REID WENT A LITTLE
CELL BLOCK "D" ON HIM.

13:36.119 --> 13:37.207
NICE.

13:37.251 --> 13:39.209
MR. BRODIE, WHERE
WERE YOU LAST NIGHT?

13:39.253 --> 13:40.994
I DON'’T GOT TO SAY A THING.

13:41.037 --> 13:43.039
WELL, ACTUALLY, YOU DO.

13:43.083 --> 13:45.215
THAT'’S ONE OF THE RIGHTS
A PERSON GIVES UP

13:45.259 --> 13:47.217
FOR ASSAULTING
UNDERAGE GIRLS.

13:47.261 --> 13:50.003
NOBODY GOT ASSAULTED.
AND IT WAS A GIRL.

13:50.046 --> 13:52.744
ONE. ME AND BRANDI
WERE IN LOVE.

13:52.788 --> 13:54.572
THAT WOULD BE
BRANDI NICHOLS,

13:54.616 --> 13:55.704
EIGHTH GRADER.

13:55.747 --> 13:59.142
WHO WAS ALL OF
13 YEARS OLD IN 2004

13:59.186 --> 14:01.579
WHEN YOU FIRST BEGAN
HAVING SEX WITH HER.

14:01.623 --> 14:02.798
HEY, IF THAT'’S A CRIME,
YOU BETTER GET OUT THERE

14:02.842 --> 14:04.495
AND SLAP THE CUFFS
ON SHAKESPEARE, TOO.

14:04.539 --> 14:05.583
EXCUSE ME?

14:05.627 --> 14:06.671
ROMEO AND JULIET.

14:06.715 --> 14:09.457
YOU KNOW HOW OLD SHE WAS? 13.

14:09.500 --> 14:11.415
SO HOW COME WITH HER,
IT'’S THIS GREAT ROMANCE,

14:11.459 --> 14:14.070
BUT WHEN IT WAS
ME AND BRANDI,
I'’M A PERVERT?

14:14.114 --> 14:15.942
NOW, MY SHAKESPEARE'’S
A LITTLE RUSTY,

14:15.985 --> 14:18.945
BUT I DON'’T REMEMBER ROMEO
BEING A 50-YEAR-OLD DEGENERATE

14:18.988 --> 14:20.903
WHO COLLECTS GIRLS'’ UNDERWEAR.

14:20.947 --> 14:22.818
PRENTISS: YOU DIDN'’T ANSWER
MY QUESTION, MR. BRODIE.

14:22.862 --> 14:26.213
WHERE WERE YOU LAST NIGHT
BETWEEN THE HOURS
OF 9 P.M. AND 4 A.M.?

14:26.256 --> 14:28.955
AT HOME WITH MY MOM.

14:28.998 --> 14:30.782
CALL AND ASK.

14:30.826 --> 14:32.045
NOW, IF YOU'’RE NOT
GONNA CHARGE ME

14:32.088 --> 14:33.524
WITH ANYTHING,
THEN I'’M--

14:33.568 --> 14:35.091
OH, WE'’RE DEFINITELY GONNA
CHARGE YOU WITH SOMETHING.

14:35.135 --> 14:38.312
PAROLE VIOLATION,
ASSAULT ON A FEDERAL AGENT.

14:38.355 --> 14:39.791
THAT SHOULD GET
THE BALL ROLLING.

14:39.835 --> 14:41.097
WAIT.

14:41.141 --> 14:43.273
I'’M GOING TO JAIL?

14:43.317 --> 14:44.535
WELL, LOOK AT IT THIS WAY.

14:44.579 --> 14:46.755
SOMEONE ASKS YOU
WHEREFORE ART THOU,

14:46.798 --> 14:49.018
YOU KNOW WHAT TO SAY.

14:50.759 --> 14:53.196
OK, SO WE HAVE
A CITYWIDE CURFEW
IN PLACE TONIGHT.

14:53.240 --> 14:54.719
I HEARD THE GOOD
NEWS ABOUT BRODIE.

14:54.763 --> 14:56.286
I'’M SCHEDULING
A PRESS CONFERENCE
TO ANNOUNCE

14:56.330 --> 14:58.549
THAT WE HAVE OUR
PRIMARY SUSPECT
IN CUSTODY.

14:58.593 --> 15:00.987
THAT'’S A LITTLE
PREMATURE, MAYOR.

15:01.030 --> 15:02.945
WHY?

15:02.989 --> 15:05.469
WELL, BECAUSE PEOPLE
ARE GONNA THINK
THE DANGER IS PASSED.

15:05.513 --> 15:06.601
IT HASN'’T.

15:06.644 --> 15:07.907
BRODIE'’S STILL
A PERSON OF INTEREST,

15:07.950 --> 15:10.474
BUT HIS VAN CAME BACK
CLEAN AND HE HAS AN ALIBI.

15:10.518 --> 15:13.303
YOU MEAN HIS MOM?

15:13.347 --> 15:15.349
AND THE ONLY REASON
THE VAN IS CLEAN

15:15.392 --> 15:17.481
IS BECAUSE HE
CLEANED IT.

15:17.525 --> 15:19.919
WE'’LL HOLD A PRESS CONFERENCE
WHEN IT'’S APPROPRIATE.

15:19.962 --> 15:21.268
OH, GOOD.

15:21.311 --> 15:22.834
WHEN WOULD THAT BE,

15:22.878 --> 15:26.229
WHEN THE NEXT BATCH
OF KIDS GOES MISSING?

15:26.273 --> 15:28.014
UNBELIEVABLE.

15:29.363 --> 15:31.147
HMM.

15:31.191 --> 15:34.585
LOOK, I KNOW HE WANTS
TO TIE THIS ALL OFF
IN A TIDY BOW, BUT COME ON.

15:34.629 --> 15:36.761
YOU THINK BRODIE'’S
OUR GUY?

15:36.805 --> 15:39.155
NO, NO.
THE GUY'’S A MORON.

15:39.199 --> 15:41.636
AND MORONS DON'’T
GRAB CHILDREN?

15:41.679 --> 15:43.203
YEAH, BUT THIS UNSUB
ISN'’T GRABBING.

15:43.246 --> 15:44.769
THE KIDS ARE GOING TO HIM.

15:44.813 --> 15:46.684
FOR AN OFFENDER TO SINK
IN THEIR HOOKS THAT DEEP

15:46.728 --> 15:48.991
REQUIRES PATIENCE,
PLANNING, AND SMARTS,

15:49.035 --> 15:50.601
NONE OF WHICH IS BRODIE.

15:50.645 --> 15:51.994
AT LEAST THIS TOWN'’S
ON HIGH ALERT.

15:52.038 --> 15:53.648
I DOUBT THERE'’S A DOOR
IN WESSER, IOWA

15:53.691 --> 15:55.476
THAT HASN'’T BEEN DOUBLE-
AND TRIPLE-BOLTED.

15:55.519 --> 15:57.521
LET'’S HOPE THAT'S ENOUGH.

17:36.446 --> 17:38.100
THE UNSUB'’S SENDING
A MESSAGE--

17:38.144 --> 17:40.581
"TAKE ALL THE PRECAUTIONS
YOU WANT, I CAN STILL
GET YOUR KIDS."

17:40.624 --> 17:42.887
KATIE'’S FATHER NOT
ONLY DOUBLE-LOCKED
THE FRONT DOOR,

17:42.931 --> 17:44.759
HE BARRICADED IT
WITH A COUCH.

17:44.802 --> 17:46.282
DID THEIR DAUGHTER KNOW ANY
OF THE OTHER MISSING KIDS?

17:46.326 --> 17:47.718
NO, SHE WAS
HOMESCHOOLED.

17:47.762 --> 17:49.459
THESE KIDS ARE LINKED SOMEHOW.

17:49.503 --> 17:52.332
WE NEED TO WIDEN OUT,
LOOK INTO EXTRACURRICULAR
ACTIVITIES--

17:52.375 --> 17:54.986
SPORTS, SUMMER CAMPS.

17:55.030 --> 17:56.814
THE KIDS ON THE
SURVEILLANCE VIDEO,

17:56.858 --> 17:59.513
THEY LOOKED LIKE THEY WERE
ON AUTO

17:59.556 --> 18:00.818
MORE LIKE ZOMBIFIED.

18:00.862 --> 18:03.734
BUT KATIE'’S PARENTS
PUT UP A BARRICADE.

18:03.778 --> 18:08.043
SO SHE WAS FORCED
TO USE IN-THE-MOMENT
COGNITIVE SKILLS

18:08.087 --> 18:09.610
TO CIRCUMVENT THE OBSTACLE.

18:09.653 --> 18:12.178
EVALUATE, PROBLEM-SOLVE,
IMPROVISE.

18:12.221 --> 18:14.005
NOT YOUR AVERAGE
ZOMBIE'’S STRONG SUIT.

18:14.049 --> 18:15.529
MAKING IT EVEN MORE
LIKELY THAT THE UNSUB

18:15.572 --> 18:17.792
HAD PREVIOUS
PERSONAL INTERACTIONS
WITH THE CHILDREN.

18:17.835 --> 18:21.056
THE UNSUB DROPPED
A PACKET OFF AT
THE LOCAL NEWSPAPER.

18:21.100 --> 18:22.275
IT'’S ON ITS WAY HERE NOW.

18:27.367 --> 18:30.239
I'’M SO COLD.

18:30.283 --> 18:32.589
IT'’LL BE WARMER IF WE
SIT CLOSE TOGETHER.

18:32.633 --> 18:34.939
COME ON.

18:41.903 --> 18:43.948
IT WAS FOUND OUTSIDE
THE NEWSPAPER OFFICES.

18:43.992 --> 18:45.385
NOBODY SAW WHO LEFT IT.

18:45.428 --> 18:48.649
NAMES OF
THE FIRST 3 KIDS.

18:51.391 --> 18:53.175
NAIL CLIPPINGS.

18:53.219 --> 18:56.439
SO WHY SEND PROOF OF LIFE
WITH NO RANSOM DEMAND?

18:56.483 --> 18:59.312
THERE WAS A FLASH DRIVE
IN THE ENVELOPE, TOO.

19:01.575 --> 19:05.927
MAN, ON TAPE:
HOW DOES IT FEEL?

19:05.970 --> 19:08.190
WHAT DID HE SAY?

19:08.234 --> 19:09.931
HOW DOES IT FEEL?

19:09.974 --> 19:14.544
OUR UNSUB USED THE EXPRESSION
"HOW DOES IT FEEL?"

19:14.588 --> 19:17.504
THIS INDICATES THAT,
WHILE HE ABDUCTED THE KIDS,

19:17.547 --> 19:19.897
OUR UNSUB'’S ANGER IS
FOCUSED ON SOMEONE ELSE.

19:19.941 --> 19:22.073
ALVEZ: IT ALSO EXPLAINS
WHY THERE APPEARS TO BE

19:22.117 --> 19:23.771
NO DELIBERATE HARM
TO THE CHILDREN.

19:23.814 --> 19:26.208
THE KIDS ARE MERELY
A MEANS TO AN END.

19:26.252 --> 19:28.297
HE'’S NOT A SEXUAL PREDATOR
NOR A KIDNAPPER

19:28.341 --> 19:29.690
IN A TRADITIONAL SENSE.

19:29.733 --> 19:31.996
THIS PERSON IS AN
INJUSTICE COLLECTOR,

19:32.040 --> 19:34.390
AND AS SUCH IS
MOTIVATED BY REVENGE.

19:34.434 --> 19:36.175
REID: NONE OF THE CHILDREN'’S
PARENTS, HOWEVER,

19:36.218 --> 19:39.090
ARE IN PROFESSIONS
THAT TYPICALLY EVOKE
REVENGE-BASED ANGER--

19:39.134 --> 19:41.223
DOCTORS, JUDGES, LAWYERS.

19:41.267 --> 19:42.572
ROSSI: WE BELIEVE THE UNSUB IS

19:42.616 --> 19:44.661
IN HIS MID-30s TO MID-40s.

19:44.705 --> 19:47.577
HE'’S THOROUGH, INTELLIGENT,
AND CALCULATING.

19:47.621 --> 19:49.927
HE MAY HAVE ALSO SUFFERED
THE LOSS OF A CHILD RECENTLY.

19:49.971 --> 19:52.408
THAT COULD BE WHAT'’S
TRIGGERED THESE
CURRENT ABDUCTIONS.

19:52.452 --> 19:54.454
NOW, WHETHER THIS WAS
A LITERAL DEATH,

19:54.497 --> 19:58.327
A PHYSICAL SEPARATION,
OR PURELY A SYMBOLIC LOSS
ISN'’T CLEAR.

19:58.371 --> 19:59.807
SIMMONS: THE CHILDREN
ARE APPARENTLY RESPONDING

19:59.850 --> 20:02.940
TO A FORM OF POST-HYPNOTIC
SUGGESTION.

20:02.984 --> 20:04.594
LEWIS: HE'’S ALSO
TECHNOLOGICAL SAVVY

20:04.638 --> 20:06.379
AND CAPABLE OF BONDING
WITH CHILDREN.

20:06.422 --> 20:08.381
IN FACT, HIS CYBER
EXPERTISE MAY BE

20:08.424 --> 20:09.730
HIS ENTREÉE INTO
THEIR WORLD.

20:09.773 --> 20:11.122
REID: AND THIS PERSON IS
KNOWN TO YOUR CHILDREN,

20:11.166 --> 20:13.168
AND HE MIGHT EVEN
BE KNOWN TO YOU.

20:13.212 --> 20:15.779
HE IS A LOCAL
AND NOT A TRANSIENT,

20:15.823 --> 20:17.825
WHICH WILL MAKE
IDENTIFYING HIM
EVEN MORE DIFFICULT.

20:17.868 --> 20:20.131
HYPERVIGILANCE IS KEY.

20:20.175 --> 20:22.960
IT'’S NOT ENOUGH TO LOCK
THE DOORS AND THE WINDOWS.

20:23.004 --> 20:25.267
ADULTS CANNOT TAKE THEIR
EYES OFF OF CHILDREN,

20:25.311 --> 20:26.399
NOT EVEN FOR A MINUTE.

20:26.442 --> 20:28.575
PRENTISS: EVEN IF YOU
THINK YOUR KIDS

20:28.618 --> 20:30.490
ARE SECURE AND PROTECTED,

20:30.533 --> 20:32.753
THIS UNSUB HAS
DEMONSTRATED TO US
THAT THEY ARE NOT.

20:32.796 --> 20:35.669
THANK YOU.

20:53.295 --> 20:56.298
AHEM.

20:56.342 --> 20:58.126
GOOD.
MM-HMM.

20:58.169 --> 20:59.214
MM-HMM.

20:59.258 --> 21:01.782
SO, UM,
I GOT A CALL

21:01.825 --> 21:04.175
FROM YOUR
INSURANCE ADJUSTOR.

21:04.219 --> 21:05.568
MM-HMM.

21:05.612 --> 21:08.005
HE WAS CALLING TO CONFIRM

21:08.049 --> 21:10.660
THAT YOU HAD
DECLINED A BENEFIT.

21:10.704 --> 21:14.316
YOUR POLICY PROVIDES
A GENEROUS RENTAL ALLOWANCE

21:14.360 --> 21:16.275
IF YOU'’RE DISPLACED
FROM YOUR HOME.

21:19.495 --> 21:20.670
SO NOW YOU KNOW.

21:20.714 --> 21:24.326
MOM, WHY WOULD YOU
MAKE UP THAT STORY

21:24.370 --> 21:26.328
THAT YOU HAD NO
OTHER OPTIONS?

21:26.372 --> 21:29.244
BECAUSE I WANTED TO
SPEND TIME WITH YOU,

21:29.288 --> 21:32.595
AND I WAS AFRAID IF I ASKED,
YOU WOULD TELL ME NO.

21:32.639 --> 21:34.075
WHY WOULD I DO THAT?

21:34.118 --> 21:35.511
OH, COME ON, JJ.

21:35.555 --> 21:38.209
YOU ARE PERFECTLY
HAPPY UP HERE

21:38.253 --> 21:40.603
WITH YOUR LIFE
JUST AS IT IS.

21:40.647 --> 21:42.866
THE SAME WAY YOU
ARE PERFECTLY HAPPY

21:42.910 --> 21:46.043
WITH YOUR LIFE IN
EAST ALLEGHENY, RIGHT?
IT DOES NOT MEAN THAT--

21:46.087 --> 21:47.697
OH, YOU THINK I'’M HAPPY?

21:47.741 --> 21:48.916
YOU THINK I'’M HAPPY

21:48.959 --> 21:51.701
IN THAT HOUSE ALL ALONE,

21:51.745 --> 21:54.704
YOUR DAD OFF WITH
HIS NEW WIFE,

21:54.748 --> 21:57.968
ONE DAUGHTER
WHO NEVER SAW 17,

21:58.012 --> 21:59.622
AND THE OTHER...

22:02.190 --> 22:05.498
THE OTHER WHAT, MOM?

22:05.541 --> 22:07.369
THE OTHER WHAT?

22:07.413 --> 22:09.066
WHO LEFT.

22:09.110 --> 22:11.939
WHO WENT AWAY
AND STAYED AWAY.

22:11.982 --> 22:13.854
I CAME BACK.

22:13.897 --> 22:15.551
YEAH, AFTER 20 YEARS.

22:15.595 --> 22:18.119
CAN YOU BLAME ME? LOOK,

22:18.162 --> 22:20.817
THE TERRIBLE MEMORIES,
WHAT HAPPENED TO ROZ,

22:20.861 --> 22:22.950
THEY'’RE...

22:22.993 --> 22:25.039
IT'’S ALL THERE...

22:25.082 --> 22:27.258
IN THAT PLACE.

22:27.302 --> 22:29.260
WELL, I'’M THERE,
TOO, REMEMBER?

22:32.873 --> 22:36.267
LEWIS: WELL, WE'’RE
CHECKING EVERY INDUSTRIAL
SPACE IN THE AREA.

22:36.311 --> 22:37.921
SO FAR NOTHING.

22:37.965 --> 22:40.141
LOOK AT THIS PHOTO FROM
KATIE LINZ'’S BEDROOM.

22:40.184 --> 22:42.404
SHE WAS MAKING SOMETHING
OUT OF PAPIER-MACHE,

22:42.448 --> 22:44.885
JUST LIKE JOEY PRYOR.

22:44.928 --> 22:46.408
SCHOOL PROJECT, MAYBE.

22:46.452 --> 22:49.063
NO, NO, KATIE
WAS HOMESCHOOLED.

22:49.106 --> 22:50.281
I'’LL HAVE GARCIA
LOOK INTO IT.

22:50.325 --> 22:52.327
YEAH.

22:52.371 --> 22:56.113
[INDISTINCT CONVERSATION
IN ADJACENT ROOM]

22:56.157 --> 22:57.941
WELL, THE SUN'’S GOING DOWN.

22:57.985 --> 23:01.205
EVERY LAST PATROL OFFICER'’S
WALKING THE STREETS.

23:01.249 --> 23:03.773
THIS LITTLE TOWN'’S
TURNED INTO A FORTRESS.

23:03.817 --> 23:06.689
THINK THE UNSUB
WILL BE DISCOURAGED?

23:06.733 --> 23:08.778
YEAH, ME, NEITHER.

23:10.911 --> 23:13.740
WOMAN: WELL, HOW MUCH
LONGER WILL YOU BE?

23:13.783 --> 23:16.917
NO, NO. I'’M JUST
MAKING UP A SPARE BED.

23:16.960 --> 23:18.440
TIMMY'’S SLEEPING IN
OUR ROOM TONIGHT,

23:18.484 --> 23:20.573
WHETHER HE LIKES IT OR NOT.

23:20.616 --> 23:23.358
MOM, WHY CAN'’T
I WATCH TV?

23:23.402 --> 23:26.187
LISTEN, I NEED TO
GET STARTED ON DINNER.

23:26.230 --> 23:28.102
LOVE YOU, TOO.

23:37.416 --> 23:39.113
SOMEBODY'’S AT THE DOOR.

24:01.483 --> 24:03.529
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

24:07.707 --> 24:10.013
WHAT'’S GOING ON?

24:10.057 --> 24:12.189
THERE'’S A DISTURBANCE
AT THE MAYOR'’S HOUSE.

24:12.233 --> 24:14.496
A NEIGHBOR SAID SHE
HEARD A CHILD SCREAM.

24:40.566 --> 24:42.785
REID: CALL AN AMBULANCE.

24:48.356 --> 24:50.053
IT'’S OK.
HELP IS ON THE WAY.

24:54.101 --> 24:57.234
ROSSI: AMBULANCE
IS ALMOST HERE.

24:57.278 --> 24:59.933
IT'’S TOO LATE.

24:59.976 --> 25:01.587
SHE'’S ALREADY DEAD.

25:10.160 --> 25:12.075
[FIRE AND RESCUE RADIO
TRANSMISSIONS]

25:17.820 --> 25:19.692
SIMMONS: WHAT THE
HELL HAPPENED HERE?

25:19.735 --> 25:22.956
MRS. TREMAINE'’S SKULL
WAS CRUSHED,
AND THE BOY'’S MISSING.

25:22.999 --> 25:24.348
THAT'’S A BIG CHANGE
IN M.O.,

25:24.392 --> 25:26.568
BUT THIS HAD TO HAVE
BEEN OUR UNSUB.

25:26.612 --> 25:28.396
JUDGING BY
THE VOLUME OF BLOOD,

25:28.439 --> 25:30.485
SHE WAS MOST LIKELY
ATTACKED HERE
AND LEFT FOR DEAD.

25:30.529 --> 25:32.574
BUT I THOUGHT
MRS. TREMAINE

25:32.618 --> 25:34.141
WAS IN THE KITCHEN
FIXING DINNER.

25:34.184 --> 25:36.709
THAT WAS AFTER THE ATTACK.

25:36.752 --> 25:38.754
COME AGAIN.

25:38.798 --> 25:40.756
HER NEOCORTEX WAS
DESTROYED,

25:40.800 --> 25:43.367
BUT HER PALEOCORTEX
MUST HAVE REMAINED INTACT.

25:43.411 --> 25:45.108
IT'’S THE MORE PRIMITIVE
PART OF THE BRAIN

25:45.152 --> 25:47.241
THAT GUIDES INSTINCT
AND HABITUAL ACTION.

25:47.284 --> 25:51.071
ROSSI: LIKE WHEN IT'’S
DINNERTIME, YOU GO FIX DINNER.

25:51.114 --> 25:55.423
OK. WELL, THAT'’S A SHARP
ESCALATION OF VIOLENCE.

25:55.466 --> 25:59.079
AND THE UNSUB DIDN'’T
TRY TO LURE TIMMY OUT
LIKE HE DID THE OTHERS.

25:59.122 --> 26:00.428
OR HE TRIED AND FAILED.

26:00.471 --> 26:01.603
MAN: MAYOR,
YOU CAN'’T GO IN--

26:01.647 --> 26:03.953
MAYOR: IT'’S MY HOUSE.
LET ME IN.

26:03.997 --> 26:05.651
THEY SAID, UH...

26:15.356 --> 26:16.966
JOAN IS DEAD.

26:17.010 --> 26:18.272
MAYOR--

26:20.013 --> 26:21.754
WHERE'’S MY BOY?

26:28.543 --> 26:29.936
HE'’S GONE, ISN'T HE?

26:29.979 --> 26:32.460
WE'’RE GONNA FIND
YOUR SON.

26:32.503 --> 26:33.940
YOU HAVE MY WORD
ON THAT.

26:33.983 --> 26:36.856
MAYOR TREMAINE, I KNOW
IT'’S DIFFICULT

26:36.899 --> 26:38.379
TO THINK CLEARLY
RIGHT NOW,

26:38.422 --> 26:40.860
BUT IT'’S INCREDIBLY
IMPORTANT THAT WE KNOW

26:40.903 --> 26:42.862
IF TIMMY HAD A CELL PHONE
OR A COMPUTER.

26:42.905 --> 26:44.690
YEAH.

26:46.300 --> 26:48.389
IT'’S UPSTAIRS
IN MY OFFICE.

26:48.432 --> 26:49.608
IT'’S IN YOUR OFFICE?

26:49.651 --> 26:50.826
MAYOR: TIMMY DIDN'’T
DO HIS CHORES,

26:50.870 --> 26:54.047
SO WE TOOK IT AWAY
FOR A FEW DAYS.

26:54.090 --> 26:55.265
SIMMONS: OK.

26:55.309 --> 26:56.876
LET'’S GET YOU
OUT OF HERE.

26:56.919 --> 26:59.400
OK? COME ON.

27:03.839 --> 27:05.624
WELL, THAT EXPLAINS IT.

27:05.667 --> 27:07.147
THE KIDS ARE BEING
LURED VIA THE INTERNET,

27:07.190 --> 27:08.714
BUT TIMMY WAS OFFLINE.

27:08.757 --> 27:13.370
SO THE UNSUB GOT AN AX
AND WENT BACK TO BASICS.

27:13.414 --> 27:16.417
SO THE WIFE AND THE
SON OF THE MAYOR.

27:16.460 --> 27:17.897
THAT CAN'’T BE
A COINCIDENCE.

27:17.940 --> 27:19.855
YEAH, AND THE PACKET WAS
SENT TO THE TOWN NEWSPAPER.

27:19.899 --> 27:21.248
I MEAN, THIS UNSUB'’S
ANGER ISN'’T DIRECTED

27:21.291 --> 27:23.032
AT ANY SPECIFIC PARENTS.

27:23.076 --> 27:25.208
HE'’S GOT A GRUDGE
AGAINST THE TOWN AS A WHOLE.

27:25.252 --> 27:27.210
GARCIA, WHAT HAVE
YOU GOT?

27:27.254 --> 27:29.865
IT TURNS OUT THAT JOEY PRYOR
AND KATIE LINZ

27:29.909 --> 27:32.259
TOOK A PAPIER-MACHE CLASS
TOGETHER AS PART

27:32.302 --> 27:33.782
OF THIS SUMMER
ACTIVITIES PROGRAM

27:33.826 --> 27:35.784
LOCATED AT
THE COUNTY FAIRGROUNDS.

27:35.828 --> 27:37.656
NOW, I KNOW WHAT YOU'’RE
THINKING, AND BEFORE YOU ASK--

27:37.699 --> 27:40.223
I'’M SORRY--THE INSTRUCTOR
WAS A RETIRED NURSE

27:40.267 --> 27:41.747
IN HER SEVENTIES.

27:41.790 --> 27:43.226
THAT'’S ABOUT AS UN-UNSUBBY
AS THEY COME.

27:43.270 --> 27:45.011
WERE THE OTHER KIDS ENROLLED?

27:45.054 --> 27:46.577
GARCIA: NOT IN THAT CLASS,

27:46.621 --> 27:48.057
BUT IN THAT ACTIVITIES
PROGRAM, YES.

27:48.101 --> 27:50.973
LET'’S SEE. AIDEN LYSON WAS
TAKING A WOODWORKING COURSE.

27:51.017 --> 27:53.628
OLIVIA WOOLSEY
WENT THE 4-H ROUTE,
LEARNING ABOUT CHICKENS.

27:53.672 --> 27:55.412
OK, SO THE UNSUB
CHERRY PICKED THE KIDS

27:55.456 --> 27:56.849
FROM THE OTHER CLASSES.

27:56.892 --> 27:58.851
I THINK WE JUST FOUND
OUR GUY'’S HUNTING GROUNDS.

27:58.894 --> 28:00.374
GARCIA: BUT I'’VE GONE
THROUGH ALL THE INSTRUCTORS,

28:00.417 --> 28:02.289
AND NOBODY MATCHES
THE UNSUB'’S PROFILE.

28:02.332 --> 28:05.422
OK, WHAT ABOUT PARENTS
OR FAIRGROUND EMPLOYEES?

28:05.466 --> 28:06.815
NO, NOBODY.
AND THE THING IS,

28:06.859 --> 28:08.295
THAT PLACE IS OPEN
TO THE PUBLIC.

28:08.338 --> 28:09.731
TONS OF PEOPLE GO
IN AND OUT,

28:09.775 --> 28:12.168
IT COULD BE PRACTICALLY
ANYBODY IN TOWN.

28:15.258 --> 28:18.566
WE FOUND THESE
ENCRYPTED EMAILS
IN TIMMY'’S INBOX.

28:18.609 --> 28:20.133
THE DATE OF
THE FIRST ONE

28:20.176 --> 28:22.004
IS THE NIGHT
THE 3 CHILDREN
VANISHED.

28:22.048 --> 28:27.009
SO TIMMY WAS MEANT
TO BE PART OF THE FIRST
GROUP OF ABDUCTIONS.

28:36.497 --> 28:37.846
THIS IS AN ASMR VIDEO--

28:37.890 --> 28:39.848
AUTONOMOUS SENSORY
MERIDIAN RESPONSE.

28:39.892 --> 28:41.632
IT'’S A TACTILE SENSORY
STIMULATION THAT CAN

28:41.676 --> 28:44.287
EVOKE LOW-GRADE EUPHORIA,
PARTICULARLY IN CHILDREN
AND YOUNG ADULTS.

28:44.331 --> 28:45.854
I'’VE NEVER HEARD OF IT.

28:45.898 --> 28:48.030
EUPHORIA. SO THAT
MUST BE THE DRUG

28:48.074 --> 28:50.206
THAT OUR UNSUB WAS
USING TO INDUCE

28:50.250 --> 28:52.513
A SUGGESTIBLE STATE
TO THE KIDS HE ABDUCTED.

28:56.299 --> 28:57.605
UH, WHAT JUST HAPPENED?

28:57.648 --> 28:59.215
I WAS AFRAID OF THIS.

28:59.259 --> 29:01.652
THE EMAILS ARE PROGRAMMED
TO SELF-DELETE
AFTER BEING VIEWED.

29:01.696 --> 29:02.958
THAT'’S WHY WE DIDN'T
FIND ANYTHING ON
THE OTHER COMPUTERS.

29:03.002 --> 29:06.222
OK, HE SENT 4 MORE
IDENTICAL EMAILS,

29:06.266 --> 29:08.485
SO WE'’LL JUST FILM
THE NEXT VIDEO

29:08.529 --> 29:09.878
AND HAVE A RECORD OF IT.

29:09.922 --> 29:11.488
TO DO THIS, THE TECHNICAL
LEVEL OF EXPERTISE

29:11.532 --> 29:12.838
WOULD HAVE TO BE
OFF THE CHARTS.

29:12.881 --> 29:14.491
I'’M TALKING
PENELOPE GARCIA LEVEL.

29:14.535 --> 29:16.145
CHANNING:
WELL, THAT NARROWS
THE SUSPECT POOL.

29:16.189 --> 29:17.407
THAT'’S GOOD, RIGHT?

29:17.451 --> 29:18.757
PRENTISS: YEAH, BUT IT
ALSO MEANS OUR UNSUB IS

29:18.800 --> 29:20.323
A LOT MORE FORMIDABLE
THAN WE THOUGHT,

29:20.367 --> 29:23.457
AND THAT'’S BAD.

29:49.918 --> 29:52.355
EUPHORIA AIN'’T
WHAT IT USED TO BE.

29:52.399 --> 29:55.489
OK. WELL, LET'’S WALK
THROUGH IT.

29:55.532 --> 29:58.187
THE KIDS CRAWL INTO BED,
THEY GO TO SLEEP.

29:58.231 --> 30:00.189
PING, THEY GET AN EMAIL.

30:00.233 --> 30:02.191
THEY OPEN IT,
WATCH THE VIDEO,

30:02.235 --> 30:04.715
GO WANDERING OUT INTO
THE NIGHT TO BE TAKEN
BY A STRANGER.

30:04.759 --> 30:06.195
THAT FEELS LIKE
A STRETCH.

30:06.239 --> 30:08.197
PRENTISS: YEAH, I AGREE.
SANDPAPER, WHISPERING.

30:08.241 --> 30:09.982
IT'’S JUST NOT ENOUGH
TO INDUCE THE BEHAVIOR

30:10.025 --> 30:11.505
WE SAW ON THAT
SURVEILLANCE TAPE.

30:11.548 --> 30:14.551
SO SOMETHING MUST BE
ADDED TO THE MIX--

30:14.595 --> 30:16.553
SUBLIMINAL MESSAGING, MAYBE.

30:16.597 --> 30:18.686
YOU MEAN, THE OLD
"EAT POPCORN" THING,

30:18.729 --> 30:20.383
BECAUSE THAT TURNED
OUT TO BE A HOAX.

30:20.427 --> 30:22.211
PRENTISS: WELL, THEY
WEREN'’T ALL HOAXES.

30:22.255 --> 30:25.214
IT'’S A SERIOUS ENOUGH
PHENOMENON THAT
SUBLIMINAL ADVERTISING'’S

30:25.258 --> 30:26.737
BEEN BANNED IN THE U.K.

30:26.781 --> 30:28.870
ALVEZ: THAT MIGHT EXPLAIN
THE PAPIER-MACHE.

30:28.914 --> 30:30.306
IT'’S A TACTILE,
IMMERSIVE ACTIVITY

30:31.699 --> 30:32.874
LIKE FINGER-PAINTING
OR WORKING A POTTER'’S WHEEL.

30:32.918 --> 30:34.745
GIVE US SOMETHING
GOOD, GARCIA.

30:34.789 --> 30:37.792
OK, I WENT THROUGH
THE ASMR VIDEO

30:37.836 --> 30:40.577
FOR SUB-VISUAL CLUES. NADA.

30:40.621 --> 30:43.406
THEN I LOOKED FOR
SUB-AUDIO CLUES,

30:43.450 --> 30:44.973
AND I FOUND THIS
RUNNING THROUGHOUT.

30:48.585 --> 30:52.154
THAT'’S LIKE THE BACK AND FORTH
OF A PLAYGROUND SWING.

30:52.198 --> 30:54.461
ALVEZ: IT MIGHT BE THE
UNSUB'’S SUBLIMINAL MESSAGE

30:54.504 --> 30:56.245
TO THE KIDS ON
WHERE TO GO.

30:56.289 --> 30:57.464
GARCIA: AND AT
NO ADDITIONAL COST

30:57.507 --> 30:59.031
TO THE AMERICAN TAXPAYER,

30:59.074 --> 31:00.728
I SCANNED FOR BACK MASKING,

31:00.771 --> 31:02.904
WHICH IS MESSAGES
PLAYED BACKWARDS

31:02.948 --> 31:05.037
OR UNDER OTHER AUDIO
TRACKS, YOU KNOW LIKE,

31:05.080 --> 31:06.299
"I BURIED PAUL."

31:06.342 --> 31:08.649
AND I FOUND THIS.

31:08.692 --> 31:12.914
MAN: HAMELIN.
HAMELIN.

31:12.958 --> 31:15.090
HAMELIN.

31:15.134 --> 31:18.485
IS THAT HAMELIN?

31:18.528 --> 31:20.052
OF "PIED PIPER" FAME.

31:20.095 --> 31:22.663
HE PLAYED A FLUTE
AND LURED
THE TOWN'’S CHILDREN

31:22.706 --> 31:24.317
FROM THEIR HOMES.

31:24.360 --> 31:27.233
THE UNSUB MUST SEE HIMSELF
AS A 21st-CENTURY
VERSION OF THAT,

31:27.276 --> 31:29.757
EXCEPT HE TRADED IN
THE FLUTE FOR A LAPTOP.

31:29.800 --> 31:31.019
GARCIA: GUYS, I THINK
I BLOCKED IT OUT

31:31.063 --> 31:32.760
AND I'’M NOT SURE I WANT
TO UNBLOCK IT BACK IN,

31:32.803 --> 31:34.936
BUT WHAT EVENTUALLY
HAPPENED TO THE KIDS
FROM HAMELIN?

31:34.980 --> 31:37.983
THEY WERE ALL LED
TO A RIVERBANK
AND DROWNED.

31:44.424 --> 31:46.948
LEWIS: HE HAD THESE KIDS
RIGHT WHERE HE WANTED THEM.

31:46.992 --> 31:49.646
ASMR, SUSCEPTIBILITY
TO TACTILE STIMULATION,

31:49.690 --> 31:50.952
SUBLIMINAL MESSAGING,

31:50.996 --> 31:52.693
PLUS, THEY'’RE AT
THE MOST VULNERABLE AGE

31:52.736 --> 31:54.303
FOR PSYCHOLOGICAL
MANIPULATION.

31:54.347 --> 31:55.914
A PERFECT STORM.
WHAT HAVE YOU GOT?

31:55.957 --> 31:58.220
EMPLOYMENT RECORDS
FOR THE SUMMER
ACTIVITIES PROGRAM.

31:58.264 --> 32:00.527
THE FIRST SET OF
PAYROLL CHECKS WERE
ISSUED ON JUNE 15th,

32:00.570 --> 32:02.007
EXCEPT FOR ONE.

32:02.050 --> 32:04.487
THE COMPUTER TEACHER
DIDN'’T GET HERS
UNTIL JULY 8th.

32:04.531 --> 32:06.750
I LOOKED BACK,
DISCOVERED THAT
THE ORIGINAL TEACHER,

32:06.794 --> 32:09.188
WAYNE HOLLIS, WAS
FIRED AFTER ONLY
3 WEEKS ON THE JOB

32:09.231 --> 32:11.190
FOR SUSPECTED
INAPPROPRIATE BEHAVIOR
WITH THE STUDENTS.

32:11.233 --> 32:14.323
LEWIS: I THINK THAT
THUD WE JUST HEARD IS A DART
HITTING A BULL'’S-EYE.

32:14.367 --> 32:16.151
WHAT KIND OF
INAPPROPRIATE BEHAVIOR?

32:16.195 --> 32:18.545
REID: UNDETERMINED
AND MAYBE NONEXISTENT.

32:18.588 --> 32:21.504
APPARENTLY, HE WOULD
MEET WITH CHILDREN
AFTER SCHOOL

32:21.548 --> 32:23.680
TO TEACH THEM THINGS,
SOMETIMES AT
THE PARK OR IN THE MALL.

32:23.724 --> 32:26.031
ANYWAY, THE PARENTS
FOUND OUT, THEY
STARTED TALKING,

32:26.074 --> 32:27.946
THINGS SNOWBALLED,
AND PEOPLE WONDERED

32:27.989 --> 32:29.295
IF HE WAS
MOLESTING THEM.

32:29.338 --> 32:31.166
SO ONCE THE GOSSIP
MACHINE REVVED UP,

32:31.210 --> 32:32.689
IT DIDN'’T SLOW DOWN.

32:32.733 --> 32:33.995
I BET YOU THE PARENTS
OF SOME OF THESE
ABDUCTED CHILDREN

32:34.039 --> 32:35.518
WERE RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE,
STIRRING THE POT.

32:35.562 --> 32:36.867
DOES HOLLIS
HAVE A REGULAR JOB?

32:36.911 --> 32:38.260
HE DOES. HE'’S
A RESEARCH CONSULTANT

32:38.304 --> 32:39.522
AT A HI-TECH FIRM
IN DES MOINES.

32:39.566 --> 32:40.654
HE'’S ALSO
A SINGLE FATHER

32:40.697 --> 32:41.916
TO A 15-YEAR-OLD
SON NAMED GARRETT.

32:41.960 --> 32:43.135
GARCIA HAS THE ADDRESS.

32:43.178 --> 32:44.179
I'’LL SEND LUKE AND DAVE.

33:07.463 --> 33:09.770
HOLLIS'’ UTILITY BILL
HASN'’T BEEN PAID
IN TWO MONTHS,

33:09.813 --> 33:12.120
AND THE TEENAGER,
GARRETT, HASN'’T BEEN
TO CLASS IN 3 WEEKS.

33:12.164 --> 33:14.296
FATHER AND SON
JUST PACKED UP AND LEFT?

33:14.340 --> 33:15.819
MAYBE. GARRETT WAS
RIDICULED AT SCHOOL

33:15.863 --> 33:17.865
FOR THE MOLESTATION
RUMORS SURROUNDING
HIS FATHER.

33:17.908 --> 33:19.649
THE ADVISOR SAID HE WAS
WORRIED ABOUT THE KID

33:19.693 --> 33:22.087
THAT HE WAS
SPIRALING DOWN.

33:26.961 --> 33:30.399
OHH, WHAT A CUTE BABY.

33:30.443 --> 33:32.053
THANK YOU.

33:32.097 --> 33:35.404
HOW OLD IS HE?
OR IS IT A SHE?

33:35.448 --> 33:38.103
HE'’S A LITTLE BOY,
AND HE'’S ALMOST 8 MONTHS OLD.

33:38.146 --> 33:42.716
IT'’S HARD TO BELIEVE
THAT PEOPLE WERE
EVER SO INNOCENT,

33:42.759 --> 33:44.500
SO PURE

33:44.544 --> 33:47.329
AND UNTAINTED.

33:48.983 --> 33:50.985
WHY DO YOU HURT HIM?

33:51.029 --> 33:51.986
PARDON ME?

33:52.030 --> 33:53.509
WHY HURT YOUR BOY?

33:53.553 --> 33:55.250
WHY DO SUCH TERRIBLE,

33:55.294 --> 33:59.124
UNTHINKABLE
THINGS TO HIM?

33:59.167 --> 34:01.430
BECAUSE THAT'’S
WHAT I HEARD

34:01.474 --> 34:05.695
FROM YOUR NEIGHBORS,
YOUR FRIENDS,

34:05.739 --> 34:08.176
THE PEOPLE YOU THOUGHT
YOU COULD TRUST,

34:08.220 --> 34:12.180
THE SAME WAY ALL OF YOU
TALKED ABOUT ME.

34:12.224 --> 34:13.616
LEAVE ME ALONE.

34:14.965 --> 34:16.097
STAY PUT.

34:16.141 --> 34:18.012
DO NOT MOVE. STOP!

34:19.492 --> 34:20.971
HOLLIS: ANY OF YOU MOVE,
I KILL HER.

34:21.015 --> 34:22.277
PLEASE DON'’T HURT ME!

34:22.321 --> 34:23.278
HOLLIS: DO NOT MOVE A STEP!

34:23.322 --> 34:24.845
SO THE HOLLIS HOUSE
WAS EMPTY?

34:24.888 --> 34:27.021
YEAH, EXCEPT FOR A CHAIR
THAT WAS KNOCKED OVER

34:27.065 --> 34:28.414
IN THE MIDDLE OF
THE LIVING ROOM.

34:28.457 --> 34:29.806
LIKE THERE'’D BEEN A STRUGGLE?

34:29.850 --> 34:31.199
THAT'’S WHAT WE THOUGHT,

34:31.243 --> 34:33.332
AND THEN LOOKED UP
AT THE CEILING.

34:33.375 --> 34:36.074
IT WAS HUNG OVER
A ROOF BEAM.

34:36.117 --> 34:38.467
MATT SAID THAT HOLLIS'’
SON GARRETT HAD BEEN TEASED

34:38.511 --> 34:41.731
AND TORMENTED
IN SCHOOL OVER RUMORS
SURROUNDING HIS FATHER.

34:41.775 --> 34:43.081
GARRETT MUST HAVE
HUNG HIMSELF.

34:43.124 --> 34:44.647
HIS FATHER FOUND HIM
AND CUT HIM DOWN.

34:44.691 --> 34:45.909
AND BURIED HIM.

34:45.953 --> 34:47.346
THERE WAS FRESHLY
TURNED DIRT IN THE BACKYARD.

34:47.389 --> 34:48.825
IT'’S BEING EXCAVATED
AS WE SPEAK.

34:48.869 --> 34:51.350
WE HAVE
A HOSTAGE SITUATION
IN LEGACY PARK.

34:51.393 --> 34:53.178
TARA AND MATT
ARE IN THE AREA.

35:00.533 --> 35:02.970
HOLLIS: I'’M SERIOUS.
DON'’T MOVE, PEOPLE!

35:03.013 --> 35:06.234
DO NOT MOVE!
RUN AWAY, I KILL HER.

35:06.278 --> 35:08.671
WAYNE HOLLIS, FBI.

35:08.715 --> 35:10.760
LET HER GO.
DROP THE WEAPON.

35:10.804 --> 35:11.935
HOLLIS: NO, NO, NO, NO.

35:11.979 --> 35:14.503
EVERYBODY IN THIS TOWN
TALKS EXCEPT ME.

35:14.547 --> 35:18.028
GOSSIP, RUMOR,
INNUENDO.

35:18.072 --> 35:20.770
YOU THINK I HURT
YOUR CHILDREN,

35:20.814 --> 35:23.164
BUT I DIDN'’T.

35:23.208 --> 35:25.166
IT WAS A LIE.

35:25.210 --> 35:27.821
WE KNOW ABOUT
YOUR SON, WAYNE.

35:27.864 --> 35:29.431
THINK ABOUT GARRETT.

35:29.475 --> 35:31.477
THIS IS NOT HOW HE'’D
WANT YOU TO REACT.

35:31.520 --> 35:33.348
IT DOESN'’T MATTER
WHAT GARRETT WANTS
OR DOESN'’T WANT.

35:33.392 --> 35:34.697
HE'’S DEAD,

35:34.741 --> 35:36.917
BECAUSE OF YOU,

35:36.960 --> 35:38.571
ALL OF YOU.

35:38.614 --> 35:41.356
HE HAD HOPES
AND DREAMS,

35:41.400 --> 35:44.620
AND YOU TOOK IT ALL
AWAY WITH YOUR LIES.

35:44.664 --> 35:46.361
LIES!

35:46.405 --> 35:51.018
WELL, NOW I'’M
TAKING SOMETHING
AWAY FROM YOU.

35:51.061 --> 35:53.934
BY THE TIME YOU FIND
YOUR CHILDREN,

35:53.977 --> 35:56.676
IT'’LL BE TOO LATE.

35:56.719 --> 35:58.721
AND THAT WILL
HAUNT YOU

35:58.765 --> 36:01.637
FOR THE REST
OF YOUR LIVES.

36:03.291 --> 36:04.597
SIMMONS: NO!

36:12.561 --> 36:14.650
NO WALLET.

36:14.694 --> 36:16.391
POCKETS ARE EMPTY.

36:16.435 --> 36:18.567
WHAT IS IT?

36:18.611 --> 36:22.223
WELL, I DON'’T KNOW.

36:22.267 --> 36:24.660
IT'’S UNLIKE ANY MUD
I'’VE EVER SEEN.

36:24.704 --> 36:26.358
LET'’S GET A RUSH
ANALYSIS ON THAT.

36:32.755 --> 36:34.888
WOMAN: HERE YOU GO,
AGENT.

36:34.931 --> 36:36.585
THANK YOU.

36:36.629 --> 36:38.326
LAB RESULTS ON THE MUD.

36:38.370 --> 36:41.242
AND?
SAMPLE CONTAINS LARGE
AMOUNTS OF PROTEASES.

36:41.286 --> 36:42.809
AND?
PROTEOLYTIC ENZYMES.

36:42.852 --> 36:44.506
THEY BREAK DOWN
THE PEPTIDE BONDS

36:44.550 --> 36:46.160
BETWEEN
AMINO ACIDS FOUND
IN COMPLEX PROTEINS.

36:46.204 --> 36:47.901
IT'’S COMMONLY FOUND
IN MEAT TENDERIZERS.

36:47.944 --> 36:49.468
GARCIA.

36:49.511 --> 36:50.860
UH...

36:50.904 --> 36:52.732
GOT IT. GREAT PLAINS
MEAT TENDERIZER.

36:52.775 --> 36:55.517
THE COMPANY WAS BASED
OUT OF WESSER, IOWA,

36:55.561 --> 36:56.997
UNTIL IT WENT OUT
OF BUSINESS 20 YEARS AGO.

36:57.040 --> 36:58.825
I'’M SENDING THE ADDRESS NOW.

37:12.882 --> 37:14.754
ANYBODY IN THERE?

37:14.797 --> 37:16.451
AIDEN, OLIVIA, JOEY.

37:16.495 --> 37:18.148
NOW, THIS UNIT'’S
LOCKED UP TIGHT.

37:18.192 --> 37:19.976
KIDS, WE'’RE THE POLICE.

37:20.020 --> 37:21.413
YOU'’RE OK NOW.

37:21.456 --> 37:22.631
ROSSI: THERE'’S GONNA
BE A LOUD NOISE.

37:22.675 --> 37:24.285
WE NEED TO KNOCK
THE LOCK OFF THE DOOR.

37:24.329 --> 37:26.156
ALL RIGHT. WATCH OUT.

37:33.207 --> 37:35.122
HEY. LOOK AT ME.

37:35.165 --> 37:37.167
WE'’RE HERE TO HELP YOU.

37:37.211 --> 37:39.474
SIMMONS: HEY, JOEY,
WE GOT YOU. COME ON.

37:39.518 --> 37:41.128
ALL RIGHT.

38:07.197 --> 38:10.157
NO CHANCE I CAN
CHANGE YOUR MIND?

38:10.200 --> 38:11.898
MM. NO, SWEETHEART.

38:11.941 --> 38:13.552
I NEED TO GO HOME.

38:13.595 --> 38:15.684
I REALLY WISH YOU'’D STAY.

38:17.817 --> 38:20.950
YOU EVER PROJECT
YOURSELF INTO THE FUTURE?

38:20.994 --> 38:23.431
HOW DO YOU MEAN?

38:23.475 --> 38:26.173
IMAGINE WHAT YOUR
LIFE'’S GONNA LOOK LIKE

38:26.216 --> 38:28.654
DOWN THE ROAD,
BUT REALLY SEE IT,

38:28.697 --> 38:32.701
LIKE IT'’S A MOVIE
AND YOU'’RE SITTING IN
THE THEATER WATCHING.

38:32.745 --> 38:36.009
I GUESS I'’VE ALWAYS
JUST BEEN

38:36.052 --> 38:38.490
TOO WRAPPED UP IN
THE CRAZINESS OF NOW.

38:38.533 --> 38:40.318
YEAH.

38:40.361 --> 38:42.842
WHEN I WAS YOUNGER,

38:42.885 --> 38:47.063
I PLAYED THIS
MOVIE IN MY HEAD
ALL THE TIME.

38:47.107 --> 38:51.154
YOU AND ROZ
ALL GROWN.

38:51.198 --> 38:54.723
YOUR DAD AND I
IN A HOUSE OUT IN
THE COUNTRY,

38:54.767 --> 38:57.770
GRANDKIDS RUNNING
ALL AROUND,

38:57.813 --> 39:00.338
FOOD COOKING
IN THE KITCHEN.

39:01.774 --> 39:03.602
THAT SOUNDS NICE.

39:03.645 --> 39:08.868
YEAH. EXCEPT IT WAS
ALL MAKE-BELIEVE.

39:08.911 --> 39:11.610
AFTER ROZ DIED,
I THREW THAT
STUPID MOVIE

39:11.653 --> 39:14.656
IN THE TRASH FOR GOOD.

39:14.700 --> 39:17.137
I BLAMED YOUR FATHER.

39:17.180 --> 39:19.139
I BLAMED MYSELF.

39:19.182 --> 39:23.448
I BLAMED THE WHOLE
DAMN WORLD.

39:23.491 --> 39:26.320
I GOT SO CAUGHT UP
IN ALL MY TROUBLES

39:26.364 --> 39:30.237
THAT I FORGOT THERE
WAS ANOTHER LITTLE
GIRL UNDER MY ROOF

39:30.280 --> 39:34.415
WHO HAD JUST LOST
HER SISTER.

39:34.459 --> 39:37.157
YOU NEEDED ME,
AND I WASN'’T THERE.

39:42.205 --> 39:43.772
YOU DID THE BEST YOU COULD.

39:43.816 --> 39:47.036
NO. NO, I DID NOT
DO MY BEST,

39:47.080 --> 39:49.082
AND I REALIZE THAT NOW,

39:49.125 --> 39:52.259
AND I AM TRULY SORRY.

39:52.302 --> 39:53.826
MOM.

39:55.480 --> 39:58.178
NOW WE KNOW THE TRUTH
ABOUT ROZ.

39:58.221 --> 40:00.876
YES. THANKS TO YOU.

40:00.920 --> 40:04.837
I'’M PROUD OF YOU.

40:04.880 --> 40:07.405
I DON'’T THINK I'VE
EVER TOLD YOU THAT.

40:09.058 --> 40:10.669
EVERY MORNING
YOU GET UP

40:10.712 --> 40:12.497
AND YOU GO TO WORK,
AND YOU MAKE

40:12.540 --> 40:14.368
A DIFFERENCE IN
PEOPLE'’S LIVES.

40:14.412 --> 40:18.981
YOU LOOK IN THOSE
FOLDERS SO THE REST
OF US DON'’T HAVE TO.

40:21.244 --> 40:23.508
THANKS, MOM.

40:23.551 --> 40:27.120
THAT MEANS MORE THAN
YOU'’LL EVER KNOW.

40:30.732 --> 40:31.777
MAN: THIS WAY.

40:31.820 --> 40:34.040
DIFFERENT MAN:
OVER HERE. RIGHT HERE.

40:36.912 --> 40:41.613
GIRL: DAD, IT'’S OK. I'M OK.

40:50.839 --> 40:52.537
A LOT OF WOUNDS TO HEAL,

40:52.580 --> 40:54.713
BUT IT'’S STARTED.

40:54.756 --> 40:56.497
I MISSED
YOU GUYS!

41:01.763 --> 41:02.938
LET'’S HEAD HOME.

41:06.681 --> 41:08.640
PRENTISS: "IT ISN'’T WHAT
THEY SAY ABOUT YOU,

41:08.683 --> 41:10.250
IT'’S WHAT THEY WHISPER."

41:10.293 --> 41:11.904
ERROL FLYNN.

41:11.947 --> 41:13.471
I'’M SO HAPPY
TO HEAR THAT.

41:13.514 --> 41:14.820
AND WHERE'’S YOUR MOM NOW?

41:14.863 --> 41:16.822
JJ: OH, SHE'’S SAYING
GOOD-BYE TO GARCIA.

41:16.865 --> 41:20.173
SHE WANTS ME
TO DRIVE HER BACK TO
PENNSYLVANIA TONIGHT.

41:20.216 --> 41:21.609
WELL, GIVE HER MY LOVE.

41:21.653 --> 41:23.872
YEAH, I WILL.

41:23.916 --> 41:27.136
UH, SPENCE, HAVE YOU...

41:27.180 --> 41:29.791
HAVE YOU EVER PROJECTED
YOURSELF

41:29.835 --> 41:32.315
INTO AN IMAGINED FUTURE?

41:32.359 --> 41:34.317
YOU KNOW, GIVEN THAT
PARTICLES CAN TRAVEL

41:34.361 --> 41:35.884
FASTER THAN
THE SPEED OF LIGHT,

41:35.928 --> 41:38.017
IT'’S ALWAYS KIND OF
FELT LIKE POINTLESS
SPECULATION.

41:38.060 --> 41:41.194
YOU'’D HAVE TO,
OBVIOUSLY, SOLVE
THAT FIRST.

41:41.237 --> 41:43.370
MM. YEAH, YEAH.
YOU'’RE RIGHT.

41:43.413 --> 41:45.677
WE WOULD DEFINITELY HAVE
TO SOLVE THAT FIRST.

41:45.720 --> 41:48.201
BUT TO ANSWER
YOUR QUESTION,

41:48.244 --> 41:51.726
YES, I ACTUALLY
HAVE 3 OR 4
IMAGINED FUTURES.

41:51.770 --> 41:53.336
REALLY?

41:53.380 --> 41:54.512
YOU SOUND SURPRISED.

41:54.555 --> 41:58.385
I AM.

41:58.428 --> 42:00.605
TELL ME ABOUT
IT SOMEDAY.

42:00.648 --> 42:02.041
IT'’S A DATE.

42:02.084 --> 42:03.956
OK.

42:06.872 --> 42:10.223
SO I HAVE A PROPOSAL.

42:10.266 --> 42:14.183
LET'’S POSTPONE

42:17.578 --> 42:19.537

42:19.580 --> 42:21.060
YEAH. WHY NOT?

42:21.103 --> 42:22.975
LET'’S DO IT.

42:23.018 --> 42:26.021
ALL RIGHT.

42:26.065 --> 42:28.676
DO YOU THINK THAT
SEAFOOD RESTAURANT'’S
STILL THERE?

42:28.720 --> 42:31.200
OH, YEAH,

42:31.244 --> 42:34.029
I THINK I'’VE HELPED
