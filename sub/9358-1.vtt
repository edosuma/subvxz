WEBVTT

00:57.024 --> 01:00.361
SAYS YOUR SOURCE GOT RELIGION
WHILE HE WAS IN THE CAN.

01:00.428 --> 01:01.495
YOU TRUST HIM?

01:01.562 --> 01:02.863
NO.

01:02.930 --> 01:04.397
(gun cocking)

01:04.465 --> 01:07.301
SHARP, WE'RE GOIN'
TO A CHURCH.

01:07.368 --> 01:09.103
THAT'S WHY I DIDN'T
BRING A HELICOPTER.

01:12.673 --> 01:14.375
EVERYBODY, GET YOUR HANDS UP.

01:16.009 --> 01:17.278
NOW KEEP 'EM UP

01:18.011 --> 01:19.079
AND SAY, "HEY!"

01:19.147 --> 01:20.148
(congregation)
HEY!

01:20.214 --> 01:21.782
SAY, "OH!"
(congregation)
OH!

01:21.849 --> 01:24.418
OH!
(congregation)
OH!

01:24.485 --> 01:27.255
ALL RIGHT. THEN GO AHEAD.

01:27.321 --> 01:31.225
WE HAVE LEARNED
FROM THE 3 WISE MEN,

01:32.393 --> 01:34.662
THE O'JAYS,

01:34.728 --> 01:38.232
EDDIE, WALTER,
AND, UH, THE OTHER GUY

01:38.299 --> 01:39.633
(congregation exclaiming)

01:39.700 --> 01:42.470
THAT THERE IS A TRAIN COMIN'

01:42.536 --> 01:45.005
AND IT IS A TRAIN OF LOVE.

01:45.072 --> 01:46.240
(congregation applauding)

01:46.307 --> 01:48.942
MICHAEL ROWED
HIS BOAT ASHORE.

01:49.009 --> 01:52.780
* HALLELUJAH *

01:52.846 --> 01:56.217
BECAUSE HE, TOO,
WANTED TO GET OFF
THAT WATER

01:56.284 --> 01:57.718
AND GET ON THE TRAIN.

01:57.785 --> 01:59.653
(Percy)
HAD THE TICKET.

02:01.655 --> 02:04.392
* OH, MICHAEL GOT OFF-A
AND RODE THE TRAIN *

02:04.458 --> 02:06.394
* HE RODE THE TRAIN OF LOVE

02:06.460 --> 02:08.496
* ROLLIN' DOWN THE TRACKS-A

02:08.562 --> 02:09.597
* THE TRAIN OF LOVE

02:09.663 --> 02:11.665
* WHERE EVERYBODY
WAS HOLDIN' HANDS *

02:11.732 --> 02:13.734
* AND GETTIN' THEIR LOVE ON *

02:13.801 --> 02:14.868
(clears throat)

02:14.935 --> 02:17.971
AND I, TOO, WANT TO BE
ON THAT SAME TRAIN.

02:18.038 --> 02:20.441
SO I WILL SEE EVERYONE
NEXT WEEK.

02:20.508 --> 02:21.742
HOPEFULLY.

02:21.809 --> 02:23.076
* GOD BE WITH YOU *

02:26.880 --> 02:28.182
(man)
HALLELUJAH!

02:30.251 --> 02:32.186
PERCY STEVENS.
WHAT'S IT BEEN?

02:32.253 --> 02:35.256
3 TO 5 YEARS WITH TIME OFF
FOR GOOD BEHAVIOR?

02:35.323 --> 02:37.491
SHARP, HOW ARE YOU?

02:38.759 --> 02:41.395
THIS IS A CHURCH, ALL RIGHT?

02:41.462 --> 02:43.364
A PLACE THAT'S SACRED.

02:43.431 --> 02:44.998
AND IT SHALL REMAIN
UNTAINTED.

02:45.065 --> 02:46.534
WE'RE LOOKING
FOR AN OLD CELLMATE
OF YOURS

02:46.600 --> 02:48.101
NAMED MORGAN BALL.
YOU SEEN HIM?

02:48.168 --> 02:50.070
HE'S A KEY WITNESS
IN ONE OF MY CASES.

02:50.137 --> 02:51.572
OH, COME ON, MAN.

02:51.639 --> 02:54.208
I DON'T HANG
WITH THAT CROWD ANYMORE.

02:54.275 --> 02:58.045
I AM A PROPHET
IN A NONPROFIT WORLD.

02:58.111 --> 02:59.213
(cell phone ringing)

03:10.858 --> 03:13.894
*(Hustle on up to Jesus
by Tree Adams playing)

03:13.961 --> 03:16.530
* YOU GOT TO MOVE
WHEN HE CALLS YOU *

03:16.597 --> 03:17.865
* PICK UP THAT DIME

03:17.931 --> 03:21.869
* YOU GOT TO
HUSTLE ON UP TO JESUS
WITH A SIGN *

03:21.935 --> 03:23.671
AREN'T YOU WORRIED
ABOUT HIM GETTIN' AWAY?

03:23.737 --> 03:25.005
(panting)

03:28.276 --> 03:30.778
I'M MORE WORRIED
ABOUT HIM HAVING
A HEART ATTACK.

03:41.722 --> 03:43.156
(exclaims)

03:43.223 --> 03:44.858
* COME ON AND LOOK FOR JESUS

03:44.925 --> 03:46.327
(cow mooing)

03:48.061 --> 03:50.431
* YOU GOT TO MOVE
WHEN HE CALLS YOU *

03:50.498 --> 03:51.699
* PICK UP THAT DIME

03:51.765 --> 03:54.302
* YOU GOT TO
HUSTLE ON UP TO JESUS *

03:56.236 --> 03:58.205
YOU WANT ME TO CALL
AN AMBULANCE FOR YOU?

03:58.272 --> 03:59.540
(gasping)

04:00.674 --> 04:02.310
LOOK, MAN,
I DON'T EVEN KNOW

04:02.376 --> 04:04.478
WHY I'M RUNNIN'
IN THE FIRST PLACE.
ALL RIGHT?

04:04.545 --> 04:06.013
I'M ON GOD'S SIDE NOW.

04:06.079 --> 04:08.916
GIVE US THE PHONE, PERCY.

04:08.982 --> 04:12.052
MAN, WHY ARE YOU ALL
TREATING ME LIKE
I'M SOME LITTLE PUNK KID?

04:12.119 --> 04:13.253
ALL RIGHT?

04:13.321 --> 04:15.022
BESIDES, THE LORD SAYS:

04:15.088 --> 04:18.024
"HE WHO IS WITHOUT SIN
CAST THE FIRST STONE."

04:18.826 --> 04:20.394
(screams)

04:20.461 --> 04:21.829
WHAT THE HELL
IS WRONG WITH YOU?

04:21.894 --> 04:23.263
IT SLIPPED.

04:24.164 --> 04:25.366
WHERE'S THE DAMN PHONE AT?

04:26.634 --> 04:28.402
(cell phone ringing)

04:31.405 --> 04:32.806
(cow mooing)

04:34.074 --> 04:35.075
(laughs)

04:35.142 --> 04:36.844
HOLY COW!

04:36.910 --> 04:39.880
IT'S--IT'S A MUSICAL COW.
LOOK AT IT. IT'S A MIRACLE.

04:39.947 --> 04:42.082
YOU KNOW, LIKE THE PARTING
OF THE RED SEA.

04:42.149 --> 04:45.786
OR, UH... OR THE TIME
I SAW MIKE TYSON'S FACE
IN A TACO.

04:45.853 --> 04:48.756
(Percy)
WHAT IS HE DOIN'?
WHAT IS HE DOIN'?

04:48.822 --> 04:50.358
NO. I KNOW HE'S NOT
ABOUT TO DO THAT.

04:50.424 --> 04:51.825
NO. COME ON, MAN.

04:51.892 --> 04:53.594
HE--HE GONNA REALLY PUT
HIS HAND UP THAT COW?

04:53.661 --> 04:56.364
YOU CAN'T DO THAT.
IT'S AGAINST
THE COW'S RIGHTS, MAN.

04:56.430 --> 04:57.998
(mooing)

04:58.065 --> 04:59.733
(Percy)
WHAT'S UP WITH THE...
EW! EW!

04:59.800 --> 05:01.902
ALL THE WAY--
IN THE HAND...

05:05.138 --> 05:06.907
(cell phone ringing)

05:09.109 --> 05:10.378
OH! IT'S FOR YOU.

05:12.413 --> 05:13.747
(grunting)

05:18.986 --> 05:20.220
HELLO.

05:20.287 --> 05:23.757
HEY, HEY, HEY, MORGAN.
CALM--CALM DOWN, MAN.

05:23.824 --> 05:26.760
ALL UNITS, STAND BY
FOR THE WHEREABOUTS
OF OUR FRIEND MORGAN BALL.

05:47.280 --> 05:49.182
(man)
THEY'RE COMIN' IN.

05:50.484 --> 05:52.352
TEXAS RANGERS LOOKING
FOR MORGAN BALL!

05:52.420 --> 05:54.254
SURE HOPE WE DON'T HAVE
THE WRONG HOUSE!

05:54.321 --> 05:56.056
(Morgan)
GO TO HELL!

06:10.170 --> 06:11.505
(grunting)

06:30.290 --> 06:32.292
(Sharp)
MORGAN, DON'T RUN.

06:44.805 --> 06:47.107
(dispatcher chattering
on radio)

06:49.710 --> 06:51.244
EDDIE ZANE, F.B.I.

06:51.311 --> 06:52.412
HOW THE HELL
DID THAT FIRE START?

06:52.480 --> 06:53.981
I DON'T KNOW.
WE HEARD SOME SHOTS.

06:54.047 --> 06:55.082
WHO'S IN THERE?

06:55.148 --> 06:56.817
SHARP AND SWANSON.

06:57.885 --> 06:59.487
CHRIST.

06:59.553 --> 07:01.021
(gun cocking)

07:04.892 --> 07:06.126
(Morgan)
HEY!

07:06.193 --> 07:08.361
YOU KNOW WHAT'S IN
THOSE BARRELS, RIGHT?

07:08.428 --> 07:10.864
ONE WRONG SHOT
AND WE COULD ALL GO.

07:12.533 --> 07:15.636
LOOK, BALL,
YOU HAVE 3 CHOICES:

07:15.703 --> 07:19.473
A: YOU COULD STAY
IN THIS HELLHOLE
AND BURN TO DEATH.

07:19.540 --> 07:23.410
B: YOU CAN COME WITH US
AND TESTIFY
AGAINST JOHN CORTLAND.

07:23.477 --> 07:25.378
A AND B SUCK.

07:25.445 --> 07:27.180
WHAT ABOUT C?

07:27.247 --> 07:29.282
C IS MY PERSONAL FAVORITE.

07:30.250 --> 07:31.919
TAKE IT EASY.

07:31.985 --> 07:34.087
I'M SURE THERE'S A WAY
WE CAN WORK OUT
THIS WHOLE THING.

07:34.154 --> 07:37.057
SEEMS LIKE IT'S PRETTY
WELL WORKED OUT TO ME.

07:37.124 --> 07:39.860
I GOT MONEY.
LOTS OF MONEY.

07:39.927 --> 07:42.462
IF YOU GET ME OUT OF HERE,
I'LL MAKE YOU BOTH RICH.

07:42.530 --> 07:45.933
LOOK, SEE THIS KEY?
IT'S YOURS.

07:45.999 --> 07:47.935
THANK YOU.
I'LL PUT THAT IN EVIDENCE.

07:48.001 --> 07:49.670
LOOK, I CAN'T TESTIFY.

07:49.737 --> 07:51.705
CORTLAND WILL KILL ME.
IT'S A DEATH SENTENCE.

07:55.208 --> 07:57.110
LET'S GO OUTSIDE
AND TALK IT OVER.

07:58.445 --> 07:59.813
(screaming)

08:15.095 --> 08:17.064
YOU GOTTA BE KIDDIN' ME.

08:17.931 --> 08:19.700
NICE JOB, SHARP.

08:19.767 --> 08:22.235
WHAT'S THAT THEY SAY?
"TEXAS RANGERS
ALWAYS GET THEIR MAN"?

08:22.302 --> 08:24.538
THAT'S THE ROYAL CANADIAN
MOUNTED POLICE.

08:24.605 --> 08:27.174
YOU BOTH HAVE FUNNY HATS
AND FUNNY BOOTS.
WHO CAN TELL YOU APART?

08:27.240 --> 08:28.275
LONG TIME, EDDIE.

08:28.341 --> 08:29.342
MORE THAN 5 YEARS.

08:29.409 --> 08:30.611
MARGARET SWANSON, EDDIE ZANE.

08:30.678 --> 08:33.145
HE'S WITH
THE FEDERAL BUREAU OF IDIOTS.

08:33.212 --> 08:35.616
I'D HAVE BECOME A RANGER
IF THEY SAID MY PARTNER
WOULD LOOK LIKE YOU.

08:35.683 --> 08:39.385
IF YOU'D HAVE BEEN A RANGER,
YOU'D HAVE CAUGHT
THIS BASTARD BY YOURSELF.

08:39.452 --> 08:41.722
THAT'S THE BEAUTIFUL THING
ABOUT WORKING
FOR THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.

08:41.789 --> 08:43.323
OTHER PEOPLE DO
YOUR GRUNT WORK FOR YOU.

08:48.461 --> 08:50.297
HOW'S YOUR DAUGHTER DOING?
DOING REAL GOOD.

08:50.363 --> 08:51.832
EXCUSE ME,
I'M BLEEDING HERE.

08:53.000 --> 08:54.501
(grunts)

08:54.568 --> 08:55.603
(Sharp)
GET DOWN!

08:56.704 --> 08:57.938
(grunts)

09:03.076 --> 09:06.313
YOU'RE GONNA BE OK.
JUST HANG IN THERE.
E.M.T. IS ON THE WAY.

09:07.080 --> 09:08.315
(grunting)

09:08.381 --> 09:10.083
(dispatcher chattering
on radio)

09:31.171 --> 09:32.840
(tires screeching)

09:38.378 --> 09:39.913
(siren wailing)

09:43.684 --> 09:44.785
(panting)

09:50.423 --> 09:52.159
(car horn blaring)

09:52.225 --> 09:53.460
(grunts)

10:05.005 --> 10:06.206
(yells)

10:10.744 --> 10:12.412
(tires screeching)

10:45.512 --> 10:47.147
(people cheering)

11:00.227 --> 11:01.261
(panting)

11:08.435 --> 11:11.604
OH, MY GOD, YOU GUYS.
IT IS SO HOT OUT THERE.

11:11.671 --> 11:13.640
I'M SO HOT,
I THINK I'M SWEATY.

11:13.707 --> 11:16.910
(Evie)
OH, GOD. I NEED
TO GET SOME AIR.

11:16.977 --> 11:18.245
(gasping)

11:18.712 --> 11:19.980
(sighing)

11:22.615 --> 11:25.285
(whispering)
OH, MY GOD.
YOU GUYS, COME HERE.

11:25.352 --> 11:26.353
WHAT?

11:26.419 --> 11:27.620
(Evie)
JUST COME HERE.

11:27.687 --> 11:29.857
GUYS, COME HERE.
SHH. COME HERE.

11:32.459 --> 11:34.261
I THINK THIS GUY
GOT MUGGED OR SOMETHING.

11:34.327 --> 11:35.428
WHAT?
WHERE?

11:35.495 --> 11:37.130
(Teresa)
OOH, SHOULD WE CALL THE COPS?

11:37.197 --> 11:39.466
(Evie)
NO, NO, NO.

11:39.532 --> 11:41.434
I THINK THIS GUY'S
COMING TO HELP HIM.

11:43.636 --> 11:44.704
(girls gasping)

11:47.240 --> 11:49.276
ONCE AGAIN, PUT IT TOGETHER

11:49.342 --> 11:54.081
FOR THE LOVELY LADIES
OF YOUR TEXAS LONGHORN
CHEER SQUAD.

11:54.147 --> 11:55.749
(crowd cheering)

11:57.317 --> 11:58.318
(screaming)

11:58.385 --> 11:59.419
(grunting)

12:06.359 --> 12:07.727
WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED?

12:07.795 --> 12:11.865
I HEARD A SHOT.
I TURNED THE CORNER,
I GOT CLIPPED.

12:11.932 --> 12:13.000
DID YOU GET
A GOOD LOOK AT HIM?

12:13.066 --> 12:14.101
NO.

12:30.117 --> 12:31.118
HELLO.

12:31.184 --> 12:32.219
YOU OK?

12:32.285 --> 12:33.887
I'M FINE.

12:33.954 --> 12:35.856
OH, I--I ORDERED FOR YOU.

12:35.923 --> 12:36.924
GOOD.

12:36.990 --> 12:38.358
MEDIUM RARE, RIGHT?
YEAH.

12:38.425 --> 12:40.160
(people chattering)

12:42.095 --> 12:43.663
HOW'S SCHOOL?

12:43.730 --> 12:45.833
AH, YOU KNOW.
THE USUAL.

12:46.499 --> 12:48.035
HOW'S YOUR MOM?

12:49.002 --> 12:50.537
I WOULDN'T REALLY KNOW.

12:50.603 --> 12:52.439
SHE AND KEITH
TOOK UP SCUBA DIVING.

12:52.505 --> 12:54.842
ANYWAY, SHE WAS
CLEANING THE HOUSE

12:54.908 --> 12:56.443
AND SHE WANTED YOU
TO HAVE THESE.

12:56.509 --> 12:57.677
(grunts)

12:57.744 --> 12:59.012
(sighing)

12:59.813 --> 13:02.049
(chuckling)

13:02.115 --> 13:03.884
UH, THIS IS
A BEAUTIFUL PICTURE

13:03.951 --> 13:06.119
OF YOU AND YOUR MOM
THERE IN LITTLE BATHING SUITS.

13:06.186 --> 13:08.021
OH, THERE'S THAT DONKEY.

13:08.088 --> 13:10.190
(chuckles)

13:10.257 --> 13:12.325
I KEEP LOOKIN' FOR
A PICTURE OF YOU AND ME,

13:12.392 --> 13:15.362
BUT I GUESS I WAS ALWAYS
TAKIN' THE PICTURES.

13:15.428 --> 13:16.663
NO, YOU WERE
JUST NEVER THERE.

13:18.131 --> 13:19.366
OR THAT.

13:22.535 --> 13:24.504
SO, I'M--I'M APPLYING
TO A FEW COLLEGES.

13:24.571 --> 13:27.507
(cell phone ringing)
RICE, S.M.U. AND...

13:27.574 --> 13:28.741
SHARP.

13:30.177 --> 13:31.244
YEAH, I'M ON MY WAY.

13:34.747 --> 13:35.883
LOOK, I'VE GOT TO, UM...

13:35.949 --> 13:37.417
GO. I GET IT.

13:42.755 --> 13:43.924
SORRY.

13:44.624 --> 13:45.893
I'M FINE.

13:56.036 --> 13:57.170
LOOKS LIKE
YOU'VE BEEN BUSY.

13:57.237 --> 13:58.505
YES, SIR.

13:59.639 --> 14:00.673
HELL, AIN'T IT?

14:00.740 --> 14:02.042
YES, SIR.

14:02.109 --> 14:04.144
THEY SAID YOU HAD
SOME WITNESSES.

14:04.211 --> 14:06.613
YEAH, THEY CAME
WALTZING IN HERE
ABOUT A HALF HOUR AGO.

14:06.679 --> 14:08.015
SAID THEY SAW
THE WHOLE THING.

14:08.081 --> 14:09.616
ANYBODY ELSE
KNOW ABOUT THIS?

14:09.682 --> 14:10.817
NO.

14:10.884 --> 14:13.220
CAN WE KEEP IT THAT WAY?
I'M TIRED OF BEING SHOT AT.

14:13.286 --> 14:14.854
YOU BET.

14:14.922 --> 14:17.257
WHO ARE YOUR WITNESSES?

14:17.324 --> 14:18.791
CHEERLEADERS.

14:21.061 --> 14:23.396
YOU KNOW, I THINK
WE COULD BE
ON THE NEWS.

14:23.463 --> 14:27.734
I'M NOT TALKING LOCAL.
I'M THINKING MAYBE
KATIE COURIC OR OPRAH.

14:27.800 --> 14:31.538
(Evie)
WE SHOULDN'T HAVE COME HERE.
I NEED TO GET TO THE LIBRARY.

14:31.604 --> 14:33.206
NOW I'LL NEVER GET
MY PSYCH PAPER DONE.

14:33.273 --> 14:35.142
I'LL JUST KEEP SEEING
HIS HEAD EXPLODE.

14:35.208 --> 14:36.709
EVIE, REMEMBER
WHAT WE SAID, ALL RIGHT?

14:36.776 --> 14:38.378
YOU GOT TO BREATHE.
YOU GOT TO BREATHE.

14:38.445 --> 14:41.514
(Barb)
LET AIR IN, AND NOW
LET THAT AIR OUT, OK?

14:41.581 --> 14:43.183
(Barb)
I TOTALLY HAVE
A DOUBLE CHIN.

14:43.250 --> 14:44.517
I DON'T TRUST COPS.

14:44.584 --> 14:46.753
WE SHOULDN'T SAY ANYTHING
TILL OUR LAWYERS GET HERE.

14:46.819 --> 14:49.522
WE DON'T NEED LAWYERS.
WE DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.

14:49.589 --> 14:52.592
RELAX, EVERYBODY.
LOOK, WE JUST CAME HERE
TO TELL 'EM WHAT WE SAW.

14:52.659 --> 14:54.027
DO WE HAVE TO?

14:54.094 --> 14:55.628
YES.

14:55.695 --> 14:58.665
AS CHEERLEADERS,
WE'RE ROLE MODELS
TO THE COMMUNITY AT LARGE.

14:58.731 --> 15:01.534
IF WE DON'T DO
THE RIGHT THING,
HOW CAN WE EXPECT OTHERS TO?

15:01.601 --> 15:03.136
NOW I'M GONNA THROW UP.

15:03.203 --> 15:05.805
I'M NOT GONNA BE
STAYING HERE
ALL NIGHT LONG.

15:05.872 --> 15:07.407
LOOK, WHY DON'T WE
JUST TELL THESE PEOPLE

15:07.474 --> 15:09.642
THAT WE NEED
TO RESCHEDULE
FOR TOMORROW?

15:09.709 --> 15:12.112
WELL, I CAN'T DO MORNING.
I'M HAVING MY LEGS WAXED.

15:12.179 --> 15:13.880
I HAVE
A BIOCHEM LAB
AT NOON.

15:13.947 --> 15:15.882
WELL, I'M GOOD
BETWEEN 2:30 AND 4:00.

15:15.949 --> 15:17.150
WOULD THAT WORK
FOR EVERYBODY?

15:17.217 --> 15:18.885
DON'T WORK FOR ME.

15:20.120 --> 15:21.254
AND WHO ARE YOU?

15:21.321 --> 15:23.823
ROLAND SHARP, TEXAS RANGER.

15:23.890 --> 15:25.792
OH, MY GOD.
DO YOU KNOW DEREK JETER?

15:25.858 --> 15:27.927
(Anne)
NO, HE MEANS
THE OTHER TEXAS RANGERS.

15:27.995 --> 15:29.396
YOU KNOW,
LIKE THE LONE RANGER.

15:29.462 --> 15:32.632
OH, HE HAD
THAT COOL INDIAN FRIEND.
WHAT WAS HIS NAME?

15:32.699 --> 15:33.733
TONTO?

15:33.800 --> 15:34.934
HE WAS HOT.

15:35.002 --> 15:36.869
WHY DON'T GUYS
WEAR LOINCLOTHS ANYMORE?

15:36.936 --> 15:38.638
A TEXAS RANGER
WAS SHOT THIS EVENING

15:38.705 --> 15:41.074
IN CONNECTION
TO THE MURDER
YOU WITNESSED.

15:41.141 --> 15:43.276
ANYTHING YOU REMEMBER,
NO MATTER HOW INSIGNIFICANT

15:43.343 --> 15:44.644
MAY BE OF
THE UTMOST IMPORTANCE.

15:44.711 --> 15:46.513
(chewing gum popping)

15:49.482 --> 15:50.517
OH, DO YOU WANT A PIECE?

15:50.583 --> 15:51.718
NO, I DO NOT.

15:51.784 --> 15:52.952
WHAT, YOU DON'T LIKE GUM?

15:53.020 --> 15:55.055
NO. CHEWING GUM
IS THE MOST SIGNIFICANT FACTOR

15:55.122 --> 15:57.490
IN THE DECLINE
OF WESTERN CIVILIZATION.

15:57.557 --> 15:59.026
THE DECLINE OF WHAT?

15:59.092 --> 16:01.294
WHEN PEOPLE CHEW GUM,
NOBODY CAN READ
THEIR EXPRESSIONS.

16:01.961 --> 16:03.563
LIKE WITH BOTOX.

16:12.805 --> 16:14.574
I LIKE AN OLDER MAN
WHO KNOWS WHAT HE WANTS.

16:16.309 --> 16:17.944
ALL RIGHT.

16:18.011 --> 16:20.480
(quivering)
WE SHOULD SO NOT
GET INVOLVED IN THIS.

16:20.547 --> 16:22.649
(Barb)
OH, GOD, HERE SHE GOES AGAIN.

16:22.715 --> 16:23.916
(Sharp)
SHE DO THIS A LOT?

16:23.983 --> 16:25.185
WHENEVER SHE GETS NERVOUS.

16:25.252 --> 16:27.654
SHE DROPS, LIKE,
10 POUNDS AROUND FINALS.

16:27.720 --> 16:29.789
CAN ANYBODY DESCRIBE
THE PERPETRATOR?

16:29.856 --> 16:31.658
"PERPETRATOR"?

16:31.724 --> 16:33.926
THE BAD MAN WITH THE GUN.

16:33.993 --> 16:35.395
OH, ACTUALLY,
HE WAS KIND OF CUTE.

16:35.462 --> 16:38.198
(Anne)
HMM. GROSS.
HE WAS A TOTAL SKANK.

16:38.265 --> 16:40.367
ON A SCALE OF 1 TO 10,
I'D GIVE HIM A 4.

16:40.433 --> 16:43.603
NO, A RUTHLESS KILLER'S
KIND OF SEXY.
I GIVE HIM AN 8.

16:43.670 --> 16:46.306
LET'S TRY TO CONCENTRATE.
HOW TALL WAS HE?

16:46.373 --> 16:48.108
AVERAGE.
LIKE, UM, 5'10".

16:48.175 --> 16:50.043
NO WAY. 6'2" AT LEAST.

16:50.110 --> 16:51.778
I THOUGHT HE WAS
KIND OF SHORT.

16:51.844 --> 16:53.646
WHAT ABOUT HIS HAIR?

16:53.713 --> 16:55.215
DEFINITELY NEEDS
TO RETHINK HIS CUT.

16:55.282 --> 16:57.450
I MEAN THE COLOR
OF HIS HAIR.

16:57.517 --> 17:00.087
IT WAS DARK. DARK.
ALMOST BLACK.

17:00.153 --> 17:01.454
NAH, I THOUGHT
IT WAS BLOND.

17:01.521 --> 17:02.889
(Teresa)
WHAT?

17:02.955 --> 17:05.392
(whispering)
THIS IS BAD. THIS IS BAD.
THIS IS BAD.

17:05.458 --> 17:06.992
DID HE HAVE ANY

17:07.993 --> 17:10.797
DISTINCTIVE
FACIAL CHARACTERISTICS?

17:17.237 --> 17:19.571
SIDEBURNS? A MOUSTACHE?

17:19.638 --> 17:21.907
OH! THERE MIGHT'VE
BEEN A MOUSTACHE.

17:21.973 --> 17:24.010
NO, DEFINITELY NOT.

17:24.077 --> 17:26.579
WAS I THE ONLY ONE
WHO SAW A GOATEE?

17:30.617 --> 17:32.219
(birds chirping)

17:37.890 --> 17:40.593
(Teresa)
MMM-MMM-MMM.
LOOK AT THESE GUYS.

17:41.561 --> 17:43.096
YOU GUYS, WAIT.

17:44.231 --> 17:45.898
(Heather chuckling)
Ew.

17:45.965 --> 17:47.234
(Heather)
OH, WAIT.

17:47.300 --> 17:50.170
LOOKS LIKE YOUR EX-BOYFRIEND,
BROOK BURTON.

17:50.237 --> 17:51.971
(Evie chuckling)
NO, HE DOESN'T.

17:53.540 --> 17:55.342
MORNING, CAP.

17:55.408 --> 17:56.843
THE DIXIE CHICKS HERE

17:56.909 --> 18:01.448
LOOKED AT 5,759 MUG SHOTS
LAST NIGHT.

18:04.050 --> 18:06.886
(Teresa)
WEE. LOOK AT THIS BAD BOY.

18:06.953 --> 18:08.788
MMM. HE IS YUMMY!

18:08.855 --> 18:11.891
HE'S KIND OF A CROSS BETWEEN
THE UNABOMBER
AND MARK WAHLBERG.

18:11.958 --> 18:13.326
(girls laughing)

18:14.527 --> 18:17.764
I NOW KNOW
THE HOTTIE RATING
OF EVERY EX-CONVICT

18:17.830 --> 18:20.467
IN THE WESTERN UNITED STATES.

18:20.533 --> 18:24.437
BEEN UP ALL NIGHT,
HAVEN'T LEARNED
A GODDAMN THING.

18:24.504 --> 18:26.506
(Anne)
OH, PLEASE TELL ME

18:26.573 --> 18:29.142
THIS SWEET THING
IS OUT ON PAROLE.
LOOK AT HIM. HE'S FINE.

18:29.209 --> 18:30.577
GIRL, GOOD.

18:30.643 --> 18:32.345
(Evie)
OH, MY GOD, YOU GUYS,
I THINK THIS GUY

18:32.412 --> 18:34.181
IS IN MY POLI-SCI CLASS.

18:34.247 --> 18:37.750
THEY ALL SAID
THEY COULD ID THAT FELLER
IF THEY SAW HIM AGAIN.

18:44.391 --> 18:46.426
THAT'S A 2-WAY MIRROR, GIRL.

18:46.493 --> 18:48.828
PEOPLE ARE WATCHING YOU.

18:48.895 --> 18:50.096
I KNOW.

18:54.434 --> 18:55.602
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

18:59.639 --> 19:01.674
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO THINK.

19:09.015 --> 19:10.483
I FEEL REALLY

19:12.652 --> 19:13.720
OLD.

19:16.689 --> 19:18.057
EXCUSE ME, CAPTAIN.

19:18.124 --> 19:22.061
THE, UH, G-GOVERNOR'S
OFFICE JUST CALLED.

19:23.930 --> 19:25.031

19:31.771 --> 19:33.906
(Governor)
THANKS FOR COMING, FELLAS.

19:33.973 --> 19:36.343
I'M GETTIN'
SOME PHONE CALLS
FROM SOME DADDIES

19:36.409 --> 19:38.010
THAT ARE WORRIED
ABOUT THEIR DAUGHTERS.

19:38.077 --> 19:40.146
THEY HAVE GOOD REASON
TO BE CONCERNED, SIR.

19:40.213 --> 19:41.648
IF CORTLAND FINDS OUT
THERE'S ANY WITNESSES,

19:41.714 --> 19:43.683
HE'LL COME AFTER 'EM
SURE AS HELL.

19:43.750 --> 19:46.453
GENTLEMEN, I TOLD THOSE GUYS
WE'D TAKE CARE
OF THEIR DAUGHTERS.

19:46.519 --> 19:47.554
STAY WITH THEM.

19:47.620 --> 19:48.621
YES, SIR.

19:48.688 --> 19:50.357
GOOD LUCK, ROLAND.

19:54.060 --> 19:55.728

IT'S A MNEMONIC DEVICE, SON.

BARBARA, ANNE, TERESA.

20:26.359 --> 20:28.328

20:28.395 --> 20:30.297
THIS IS WHAT THEY CALL
A PLAINCLOTHES OPERATION.

20:30.363 --> 20:33.300
TAKE YOUR HAT OFF.
CONCEAL YOUR BADGE.
TRY TO LOOK NORMAL.

20:33.366 --> 20:36.168
YES, SIR. AND IF I MAY, SIR,
I JUST WANT TO SAY THANK YOU

20:36.235 --> 20:37.737
FOR TAKING ME ALONG
ON THIS ONE, SIR.

20:37.804 --> 20:39.539
THAT'S THE 3RD TIME TODAY
YOU'VE THANKED ME,

20:39.606 --> 20:41.073
AND I CAN HONESTLY SAY
AT THIS POINT

20:41.140 --> 20:43.343
I FEEL THE FULL BRUNT
OF YOUR GRATITUDE.

20:45.345 --> 20:46.713
THANK YOU AGAIN, SIR.

20:46.779 --> 20:48.548
GET IN THE DAMN VAN.

20:49.616 --> 20:52.619
(Heather)
YOU, MOVE OVER.

20:52.685 --> 20:55.021
YOU THINK YOU COULD
TURN SOME MUSIC ON
OR SOMETHING?

20:55.087 --> 20:56.889
(car engine starting)

21:01.694 --> 21:02.829
TURN THE MOTOR OFF.

21:02.895 --> 21:03.996
PROBLEM, SIR?

21:04.063 --> 21:05.598
WE DON'T HAVE
A SECURE CABIN.

21:05.665 --> 21:08.568
THIS VEHICLE WILL NOT MOVE
UNTIL ALL THESE LADIES
BUCKLE UP.

21:08.635 --> 21:09.836
YOU'RE KIDDING, RIGHT?

21:09.902 --> 21:12.071
ONE THING YOU'LL LEARN
ABOUT ME IS I DO NOT KID,

21:12.138 --> 21:14.173
OR JEST, OR JOKE, OR JAPE,

21:14.674 --> 21:15.908
OR QUIP.

21:20.980 --> 21:23.683
LOOKS LIKE WE'RE WAITING
ON YOU, TERESA.

21:24.684 --> 21:26.052
I SAW THAT.

21:32.792 --> 21:34.394
I SAW THAT, TOO.

21:36.629 --> 21:38.264

(people chattering)

21:47.407 --> 21:49.942
(reporter #1)
MR. CORTLAND, DO YOU EXPECT
ANY FURTHER CHARGES

21:50.009 --> 21:51.578
TO BE FILED AGAINST YOU?

21:51.644 --> 21:54.246
(reporter #2)
MR. CORTLAND, HOW DO YOU FEEL
ABOUT THE VERDICT?

21:54.313 --> 21:56.082
AFTER FAILING
TO PRODUCE
ANY EVIDENCE,

21:56.148 --> 21:59.486
THE GOVERNMENT HAS
DROPPED ALL CHARGES
AGAINST JOHN W. CORTLAND.

21:59.552 --> 22:02.188
NEEDLESS TO SAY,
MY CLIENT IS PLEASED
WITH THIS OUTCOME.

22:02.254 --> 22:04.957
WHAT ABOUT THE MURDER
OF A KEY GOVERNMENT WITNESS
LAST NIGHT?

22:05.024 --> 22:06.826
IF YOU'LL EXCUSE US,
MR. CORTLAND IS ANXIOUS

22:06.893 --> 22:08.361
TO GET HOME TO HIS FAMILY.

22:08.428 --> 22:10.029
NO FURTHER COMMENT.

22:10.096 --> 22:12.499

ARE YOU DENYING ANY
PRIOR KNOWLEDGE, MR. CORTLAND?

22:28.280 --> 22:30.617
(Cortland)
IT'S ME. I STILL DON'T HAVE
THE MONEY BALL STOLE FROM ME.

22:30.683 --> 22:33.219
AND THE SHOOTER
YOU BROUGHT IN
SHOT A RANGER.

22:33.285 --> 22:35.422
I COVERED FOR HIM.
THE JOB GOT DONE.

22:35.488 --> 22:38.525
(Zane)
EVEN SHOT MYSELF IN THE ARM.
YOU'RE A FREE MAN.

22:38.591 --> 22:40.359
YEAH, WELL, HERE'S THE THING.

22:40.427 --> 22:42.228
YOU LEFT SOME WITNESSES.

22:42.294 --> 22:44.196
HEY, PULL UP OVER HERE.

22:49.168 --> 22:51.170
NOW YOU LISTEN HERE.

22:51.237 --> 22:54.206
YOU BETTER START
CLEANING THIS MESS UP.

22:54.273 --> 22:55.775
ALREADY ON IT.

YOU COULDN'T POSSIBLY
BE TALKING ABOUT MY MOTHER

25:04.036 --> 25:06.539
BECAUSE MY MOTHER
IS ALLERGIC TO DOGS.

25:06.606 --> 25:09.175
FIRST RULE: NO CELL PHONES.

25:09.241 --> 25:10.376
(all)
WHAT?

25:10.442 --> 25:13.780
NO PAGERS,
NO PALM PILOTS AND NO E-MAIL.

25:13.846 --> 25:16.315
AND THE TELEPHONE DOWNSTAIRS
MAY BE USED

25:16.382 --> 25:18.184
IN THE EVENT
OF EMERGENCIES ONLY.

25:18.250 --> 25:20.352
GIVE IT UP.

25:20.419 --> 25:22.722
SEND US BACK
TO THE STONE AGE,
WHY DON'T YOU?

25:22.789 --> 25:24.791
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHAT SERIOUS BUSINESS THIS IS.

25:24.857 --> 25:26.492
IN ORDER FOR US
TO DO OUR JOB,

25:26.559 --> 25:27.694
WE'RE GONNA NEED
YOUR COOPERATION

25:27.760 --> 25:29.796
AND THAT MEANS
PAYIN' ATTENTION
TO WHAT I SAY

25:29.862 --> 25:32.565
AND DOIN' WHAT
I ASK YOU TO DO
WHEN I ASK YOU TO DO IT.

25:32.632 --> 25:34.300
FURTHERMORE,
I'D APPRECIATE IT

25:34.366 --> 25:37.003
IF YOU WOULD
COVER YOURSELVES
IN OUR PRESENCE.

25:37.069 --> 25:38.638
I REALIZE
HOW VERY PROUD YOU ARE

25:38.705 --> 25:41.808
OF YOUR TATTOOS AND PIERCINGS,
AND OTHER BODY MODIFICATIONS.

25:41.874 --> 25:44.711
HOWEVER, MY COLLEAGUES AND I
DO NOT NEED TO SEE THESE.

25:44.777 --> 25:45.945
ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS?

25:46.012 --> 25:48.915
I HAVE ONE.
ARE YOU ALWAYS
SUCH A DICK?

25:48.981 --> 25:51.984
YES. THERE WILL BE NO GUESTS
IN THE HOUSE EVER.

25:52.051 --> 25:55.154
NOBODY MAY LEAVE THE HOUSE
WITHOUT AN ESCORT.

25:55.221 --> 25:56.288
BUT THIS IS OUR HOUSE.

25:56.355 --> 25:57.624
NO, NO, NO.
WHAT ABOUT CLASSES?

25:57.690 --> 26:00.159
I'M IN AN ADVANCED
PRE-MED PROGRAM.
I HAVE A--

26:00.226 --> 26:01.794
(all)
4.0, WE KNOW.

26:01.861 --> 26:04.263
OK, GUYS.
WELL, IF I MISS
MY BIOCHEM CLASS,

26:04.330 --> 26:06.198
I'M GONNA LOSE
MY SCHOLARSHIP.

26:06.265 --> 26:08.000
THERE ARE 5 OF Y'ALL,
THERE'S 3 OF US.

26:08.067 --> 26:10.970
YOU'LL HAVE TO PARE
YOUR SCHEDULES DOWN
TO THE ABSOLUTE ESSENTIALS.

26:11.037 --> 26:12.571
I'M WILLING TO SKIP
ALL MY CLASSES

26:12.639 --> 26:13.773
FOR THE GREATER GOOD
OF THE GROUP.

26:13.840 --> 26:15.274
WORK IT OUT
AMONGST YOURSELVES.

26:15.341 --> 26:17.476
WHAT ABOUT DATES?
BARB'S GOT, LIKE, 2 TONIGHT.

26:17.543 --> 26:18.945
NOT ANYMORE.

26:19.011 --> 26:21.047
HELLO! LOOK, YOU GUYS,
WE'VE GOT A GAME ON SATURDAY.

26:21.113 --> 26:23.115
DON'T EVEN THINK
ABOUT TELLING US
WE'RE NOT GOING.

26:23.182 --> 26:24.617
YOU'RE NOT GOIN'.

26:24.684 --> 26:25.952
DON'T SAY IT.

26:26.018 --> 26:28.721
AS CAPTAIN OF THIS SQUAD,
IT IS MY DUTY TO INFORM YOU

26:28.788 --> 26:30.757
THAT IF YOU WANT
TO STOP US
FROM CHEERLEADING,

26:30.823 --> 26:34.727
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
TO PRY THE POM-POMS
FROM OUR COLD, DEAD HANDS.

26:37.463 --> 26:39.065
(crowd cheering)

26:46.773 --> 26:48.307
(whistle blows)

26:52.444 --> 26:55.748
I'M ALL CLEAR.

26:55.815 --> 26:59.018
COME ON, NOW, ASST.
CHEERLEADING COACH SHARP,
SHOW ME YOUR SPIRIT.

26:59.085 --> 27:00.619
WHERE'S YOUR HAPPY FACE?

27:00.687 --> 27:03.155
THIS IS MY HAPPY FACE.

27:03.222 --> 27:06.425
WELL, I THINK
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO
TURN THAT FROWN UPSIDE DOWN.

27:06.492 --> 27:07.927
UH-HUH.

27:07.994 --> 27:10.529
NOW THIS CANNOT BE
HOW YOU HELPED FLORIDA STATE

27:10.596 --> 27:12.398
TO THE REGIONAL FINALS.

27:12.464 --> 27:13.599
UH, COACH BEAUREGARD?

27:13.666 --> 27:14.934
OH, PLEASE, BINKY.

27:15.001 --> 27:16.703
OK, BINKY.

27:16.769 --> 27:18.705
I SPECIALIZE IN STRENGTH
AND CONDITIONING

27:18.771 --> 27:22.008
AND I'M GONNA LEAVE
THE GRINNING AND THE SMILING
UP TO YOU.

27:22.074 --> 27:23.609
WELL, OKEY-DOKEY THEN.

27:23.676 --> 27:24.711
(laughs)

27:24.777 --> 27:26.612
ASSIGNMENT ACCEPTED.

27:26.679 --> 27:28.447
(spectator whooping)

27:29.181 --> 27:30.549
(whistling)

27:30.616 --> 27:31.951
TIME-OUT

27:32.018 --> 27:33.185
TEXAS.

27:33.753 --> 27:35.054
(crowd cheering)

27:35.121 --> 27:36.455
(cheering)

27:37.656 --> 27:39.025
*(playing)

28:13.726 --> 28:15.227
GUN, GUN, GUN!

28:19.265 --> 28:20.432
(crowd cheering)

28:30.276 --> 28:31.477
A WATER GUN, SIR.

28:31.543 --> 28:33.012
PLEASE DON'T HURT ME.
IT'S JUST A JOKE.

28:42.789 --> 28:44.423
(spectator)
NICE HIT!

28:44.490 --> 28:45.758
(panting)

28:48.727 --> 28:50.396
(crowd applauding)

28:51.764 --> 28:53.365
(crowd cheering)

29:30.536 --> 29:32.204
(knocking on door)

29:33.840 --> 29:35.842
(whispering)
CHECK IT OUT.

29:42.481 --> 29:44.716
HOWDY, NEIGHBOR.

29:44.783 --> 29:47.119
UM, I'M JIMMY
FROM NEXT DOOR.

29:47.186 --> 29:48.587
JUST, UH, WANTED
TO COME BY

29:48.654 --> 29:50.622
AND WELCOME YOU
TO THE BUILDING.

29:50.689 --> 29:54.693
AND, UH, YOU KNOW,
IF YOU NEED ANY WEED
OR ANYTHING,

29:56.062 --> 29:58.097
JUST COME BANG ON MY DOOR.

29:59.731 --> 30:01.934
WELL, THAT'S GOOD
TO KNOW, JIMMY.

30:02.001 --> 30:03.402
YOU'LL DEFINITELY
BE HEARING FROM US.

30:03.836 --> 30:04.937
COOL.

30:08.507 --> 30:09.808
2200 HOURS.

30:09.876 --> 30:11.510
(Riggs)
HE-BAT IS SECURE.

30:11.577 --> 30:13.745
(Sharp)
ROGER THAT. WE'LL SEE Y'ALL
IN THE MORNIN'.

30:13.812 --> 30:16.048
*(Blue Eyes Crying
in the Rain
by Willie Nelson playing)

30:16.115 --> 30:19.585
* BLUE EYES CRYING
IN THE RAIN *

30:23.089 --> 30:27.793
* WHEN WE KISSED GOODBYE
AND PARTED *

30:27.860 --> 30:29.361
I DON'T SLEEP.

30:30.629 --> 30:32.331
* I KNEW

30:32.398 --> 30:34.366
ISN'T THAT YOUR PARTNER?

30:37.469 --> 30:39.771
SHOULDN'T YOU HAVE GONE
TO THE HOSPITAL?

30:39.838 --> 30:40.873
NO.

30:41.807 --> 30:43.375
I'M HERE.

30:43.442 --> 30:45.644
RIGHT. BUT SHE'S BEEN SHOT.

30:45.711 --> 30:47.246
THAT'S PART OF THE JOB.

30:47.313 --> 30:51.417
* AND ONLY MEMORIES REMAIN *

30:51.483 --> 30:53.619
YOU EVER KILL ANYONE, SHARP?

30:55.554 --> 30:56.755
(sighs)

31:07.133 --> 31:09.835
COLD BASTARD
PROBABLY DOESN'T EVEN CARE.

31:17.243 --> 31:19.245
HER MIDDLE NAME IS ELLEN.

31:21.380 --> 31:22.714
A LOT OF THE FELLAS
WEREN'T HAPPY

31:22.781 --> 31:24.550
WHEN THE RANGERS
STARTED RECRUITING WOMEN

31:24.616 --> 31:26.953
AND I WAS SURE ENOUGH
ONE OF 'EM.

31:30.022 --> 31:31.790
SHE CHANGED MY MIND.

31:36.128 --> 31:38.030
I ALSO HEAR EVERYTHING.

31:40.166 --> 31:43.502
"THE BRIGHTNESS OF HER CHEEK
WOULD SHAME THOSE STARS

31:43.569 --> 31:45.837
"AS DAYLIGHT DOTH A LAMP

31:45.904 --> 31:47.773
"HER EYES IN HEAVEN

31:47.839 --> 31:50.709
"WOULD THROUGH
THE AIRY REGION
STREAM SO BRIGHT

31:50.776 --> 31:55.147
THAT BIRDS WOULD SING
AND THINK IT WERE NOT NIGHT"

31:55.214 --> 31:59.618
SO, YOUR ASSIGNMENT
IS TO WRITE A 5-PAGE PAPER,

31:59.685 --> 32:01.487
DUE A WEEK FROM FRIDAY,

32:01.553 --> 32:04.656
DESCRIBING THE FUNCTION
OF THE RECURRENT IMAGERY

32:04.723 --> 32:07.926
OF LIGHT AGAINST DARKNESS
IN ROMEO AND JULIET.

32:07.994 --> 32:11.763
WHAT DOES IT MEAN?
HOW DOES IT MEAN IT?

32:11.830 --> 32:14.466
AND IS IT POSSIBLE
THAT THIS PLAY

32:14.533 --> 32:17.903
IS MORE THAN JUST
A TEENAGE ROMANCE
WITH A SAD ENDING?

32:18.570 --> 32:20.072
(bell ringing)

32:21.873 --> 32:23.109
MISS THOMPSON.

32:23.175 --> 32:25.677
I WANT TO SEE YOU
IN MY OFFICE. NOW.

32:28.914 --> 32:30.716
(students chattering)

32:34.987 --> 32:36.388
UH, SHE'D LIKE
TO SEE YOU.

32:36.455 --> 32:37.489
WHAT FOR?

32:37.556 --> 32:39.191
UM, I DON'T KNOW.

32:43.262 --> 32:46.132
MR. SHARP. COME IN.
HAVE A SEAT.

32:52.338 --> 32:55.541
SO, I UNDERSTAND
YOU'RE THE NEW ASSISTANT
CHEERLEADING COACH.

32:55.607 --> 32:56.708
THAT'S RIGHT.

32:56.775 --> 32:58.277
MAY I ASK WHAT YOU
WERE DOING IN MY CLASS?

32:58.344 --> 33:01.513
THAT'S THE WAY
WE DO THINGS
ON OUR SQUAD.

33:01.580 --> 33:02.814
(stammering)
IF SOMEBODY'S IN THE--

33:02.881 --> 33:04.816
LET ME BE BLUNT, MR. SHARP.

33:04.883 --> 33:08.387
BARB'S CHEERLEADING
IS INTERFERING WITH HER WORK.

33:08.454 --> 33:10.156
AND FOR THE RECORD,
YOU SHOULD KNOW

33:10.222 --> 33:11.757
I THINK CHEERLEADING
IS STUPID.

33:11.823 --> 33:13.325
I COULDN'T AGREE
WITH YOU MORE.

33:15.394 --> 33:19.631
SHE DOWNLOADED THIS PAPER
ON PLANT IMAGERY IN MACBETH

33:19.698 --> 33:21.367
OFF THE INTERNET.

33:21.433 --> 33:24.803
I KNOW, BECAUSE I WROTE IT
20 YEARS AGO WHEN I WAS
AN UNDERGRADUATE.

33:24.870 --> 33:25.871
HMM.

33:25.937 --> 33:27.206
MUST BE A HELL OF A PAPER.

33:28.907 --> 33:30.909
WELL, YES,
I THOUGHT IT WAS PRETTY GOOD.

33:31.910 --> 33:33.712
BUT THAT IS NOT THE POINT.

33:33.779 --> 33:36.615
PLAGIARISM IS SIMPLY
NOT ACCEPTABLE.

33:36.682 --> 33:39.085
NOW, I'VE GIVEN BARB AN "F"
ON THAT ASSIGNMENT.

33:39.151 --> 33:40.986
IF SHE WANTS
TO REMAIN ON THE SQUAD,

33:41.053 --> 33:43.122
OR IN THE SCHOOL,
FOR THAT MATTER,

33:43.189 --> 33:45.224
HER NEXT PAPER
ON ROMEO AND JULIET

33:45.291 --> 33:46.958
HAD BETTER BE
WHOLLY ORIGINAL.

33:47.025 --> 33:48.760
I'LL EXPLAIN
YOUR POSITION TO BARB

33:48.827 --> 33:51.730
AND MAKE SURE
SHE UNDERSTANDS IT,
EXPLICITLY.

33:53.432 --> 33:54.800
WELL, GOOD.

33:56.202 --> 33:57.303
FINE.

34:00.339 --> 34:01.740
OK, WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL?

34:01.807 --> 34:03.442
PRESIDENTS DON'T WRITE
THEIR SPEECHES.

34:03.509 --> 34:04.643
WHEN YOU'RE PRESIDENT,

34:04.710 --> 34:07.113
YOU CAN BE LENIENT
AS YOU WANT TO
ON PLAGIARISM.

34:07.179 --> 34:09.481
OH, BUT WAIT. I MEAN,
THIS PLAY HAS, LIKE, 5 ACTS.

34:09.547 --> 34:11.083
SHE CAN'T EXPECT ME
TO READ THE WHOLE THING.

34:11.150 --> 34:14.085
IT'S ALL WRITTEN
IN YE OLDE
WEIRD ENGLISH ANYWAY.

34:14.152 --> 34:15.154
HEY, BARB.

34:15.221 --> 34:17.188
OH, HI, SCOOT.

34:17.255 --> 34:20.092
UM, I MEAN, BESIDES,
PEOPLE THINK BEING
A CHEERLEADER

34:20.159 --> 34:21.627
IS THIS NONSTOP PARTY
AND EVERYTHING

34:21.693 --> 34:23.429
BUT, YOU KNOW,
THEY'RE SO WRONG.

34:23.495 --> 34:24.496
HEY, BARB.

34:24.563 --> 34:25.764
OH, HI, CHASE.

34:25.831 --> 34:28.266
I MEAN, ASIDE FROM ALL
MY GAMES AND MY PRACTICES,

34:28.333 --> 34:30.636
THEY STILL EXPECT ME
TO MAINTAIN
THIS 2.0 AVERAGE,

34:30.702 --> 34:32.204
AND I CAN'T DO THAT.

34:32.271 --> 34:33.739
YOU NEED TO MANAGE
YOUR TIME BETTER.

34:33.804 --> 34:36.975
TIME? WHAT TIME?
I DON'T HAVE ANY TIME.

34:37.042 --> 34:38.110
HEY, BARB.

34:38.177 --> 34:39.645
OH, HI, TIM.

34:39.710 --> 34:40.846
TOM.

34:40.911 --> 34:43.149
OH, SHOOT!
SORRY. TOM.

34:43.215 --> 34:44.616
I REALLY LIKED HIM, TOO.

34:44.683 --> 34:46.952
YOU GOT SOME ADMIRERS
ON THIS CAMPUS HERE,
DON'T YOU?

34:47.018 --> 34:49.788
DON'T BE JEALOUS.
THEY'RE JUST SILLY BOYS.

34:49.855 --> 34:52.690
WE CAN STOP THIS CHARADE
AND RUN AWAY TOGETHER.

34:52.757 --> 34:54.793
YOU GOT A PAPER TO WRITE.

34:54.860 --> 34:56.328
I KNOW.
BUT IF I WRITE IT MYSELF,

34:56.395 --> 34:57.563
IT'S JUST GONNA BE STUPID.

34:57.629 --> 34:59.097
YOU DON'T KNOW THAT
BECAUSE YOU HAVEN'T TRIED.

34:59.165 --> 35:01.333
CHEATING IS
A HELL OF A LOT WORSE
THAN BEING STUPID.

35:01.400 --> 35:03.935
PLAGIARISM IS
AN ACADEMIC CRIME.

35:04.002 --> 35:06.438
IT IS PUNISHABLE
BY ACADEMIC DEATH.

35:08.340 --> 35:09.641
WHAT DO YOU CARE ANYWAY?

35:09.708 --> 35:11.643
I WANNA SEE YOU STAY ALIVE,
ACADEMICALLY, PHYSICALLY,

35:11.710 --> 35:12.978
AND EVERY OTHER WAY.

35:14.513 --> 35:15.914
YOU LIKE ME, DON'T YOU?

35:15.981 --> 35:17.015
NO.

35:25.056 --> 35:27.493
*(Hey Ladies playing)

35:27.559 --> 35:28.860

35:52.218 --> 35:54.320
SERGEANT, YOUR PIZZA'S HERE.

ROGER THAT.

35:55.854 --> 35:58.457
* OH, MY GIRLFRIEND

35:59.591 --> 36:01.427
SET THE PIZZA ON THE PORCH

36:01.493 --> 36:04.996

AND PLACE YOUR HANDS

36:21.146 --> 36:23.849

36:23.915 --> 36:27.386
IF THAT PIZZA'S HOT,
THERE WON'T BE ANY PROBLEM.

* I'M GONNA PARTY TONIGHT

36:38.264 --> 36:39.498
ALL RIGHT,
WHAT DO I OWE YOU?

36:39.565 --> 36:41.066
UH, $13.75.

36:42.601 --> 36:45.136
* POPPIN' BOTTLES
FOR ALL MY LADIES *

36:46.405 --> 36:49.174
HEY, UH, DO YOU LIVE HERE
WITH ALL THESE GIRLS?

36:49.241 --> 36:50.809
TEMPORARILY.

36:50.876 --> 36:52.344
DUDE, YOU'RE MY NEW HERO.

36:54.045 --> 36:56.282
IMAGINE WHAT THAT MEANS TO ME.

37:02.988 --> 37:04.022
THANK YOU.

37:04.089 --> 37:06.191
(Teresa)
YOU'RE WELCOME.

37:06.258 --> 37:09.495
WITHOUT MY PHONE,
I AM NOTHING,
I AM WORTHLESS.

37:09.561 --> 37:10.962
I NEED TO SPEAK
TO MY ANTONIO...

37:11.029 --> 37:13.299
(speaking Spanish)

37:15.934 --> 37:17.102
WHAT IS THAT?

37:17.168 --> 37:18.804
(Sharp)
THE CARNIVORE.

37:18.870 --> 37:21.039
PEPPERONI, SAUSAGE,
GROUND BEEF, HAM,
AND OLIVE LOAF,

37:21.106 --> 37:23.609
GATHERED TOGETHER
IN ONE SAVORY PIE.

37:24.910 --> 37:26.177
WITH JALAPENOS.

37:26.244 --> 37:27.245
WANT SOME?

37:27.313 --> 37:28.980
YES. NO.

37:29.047 --> 37:30.649
EXTRA-THICK CRUST.

37:30.716 --> 37:31.783
I CAN'T.
I'M ON THE ZONE.

37:31.850 --> 37:33.319
WHAT ZONE?

37:33.385 --> 37:35.421
THE PROPER COMBINATION
OF PROTEIN, FAT,
AND CARBOHYDRATES.

37:35.487 --> 37:37.556
THIS COMBINATION RIGHT HERE
IS PROPER AS HELL.

37:37.623 --> 37:39.157
I'M A TOTAL ATKINS GIRL.

37:39.224 --> 37:40.992
I DO WEIGHT WATCHERS.

37:41.059 --> 37:43.261
YOU'LL PROBABLY BLOW
ALL YOUR DAILY POINTS
WITH JUST ONE BITE.

37:43.329 --> 37:48.334
THIS BABY HAS ONE POINT
AND ONE POINT ONLY,
AND THAT IS TASTING GOOD.

37:48.400 --> 37:50.436
I DON'T KNOW
WHY YOU GIRLS
ARE ON A DIET, ANYWAY.

37:50.502 --> 37:51.570
YOU COULDN'T WEIGH
ANY MORE THAN--

37:51.637 --> 37:53.071
(all chattering)

37:53.138 --> 37:54.806
DON'T EVEN GO THERE.

37:54.873 --> 37:57.643
NO, THERE ARE SOME THINGS
WE JUST DON'T DISCUSS.

37:57.709 --> 37:59.611
MY DAUGHTER HAS
A VERY HEALTHY APPETITE.

37:59.678 --> 38:02.080
INTERESTING.
YOU NEVER MENTIONED
YOU HAD A DAUGHTER.

38:02.147 --> 38:03.248
WHAT'S HER NAME?
EMMA.

38:03.315 --> 38:04.916
HOW OLD IS SHE?
17.

38:04.983 --> 38:05.984
IS SHE A CHEERLEADER?

38:06.051 --> 38:07.085
I HOPE NOT.

38:07.152 --> 38:08.253
WHAT'S HER FAVORITE BAND?

38:08.320 --> 38:09.788
UH, Y-Y-Y-YOU GOT ME.

38:09.855 --> 38:11.256
HOW ABOUT HER SIGN?
HUH?

38:11.323 --> 38:12.991
IS SHE SEXUALLY ACTIVE?

38:13.058 --> 38:14.192
HELL, NO.

38:14.259 --> 38:15.627
SHE PROBABLY IS.

38:15.694 --> 38:17.863
68% OF HIGH-SCHOOL STUDENTS
IN TEXAS HAVE HAD SEX

38:17.929 --> 38:19.765
BY THE TIME THEY'VE REACHED
THE 12TH GRADE.

38:19.831 --> 38:22.100
SLIGHTLY HIGHER THAN
THE NATIONAL AVERAGE.

38:22.167 --> 38:24.135
THANK YOU FOR RUINING MY DAY.

38:24.202 --> 38:27.072
WELL, I'LL TELL YOU ONE THING
ABOUT THIS DAUGHTER
YOU KNOW NOTHING ABOUT.

38:27.138 --> 38:29.741
SHE MUST BE SUPREMELY
MESSED UP IN THE HEAD

38:29.808 --> 38:31.242
FROM LIVING
IN A HOUSE WITH YOU.

38:31.309 --> 38:32.978
SHE LIVES WITH HER MOTHER.

38:33.044 --> 38:34.580
WHY DID YOUR MARRIAGE
FALL APART?

38:34.646 --> 38:37.182
THAT IS ONE OF MANY THINGS
THAT YOU AND I
WILL NEVER DISCUSS.

38:37.248 --> 38:40.786
YOU SEE,
YOU CLEARLY DON'T KNOW
HOW TO SPEAK TO WOMEN.

38:40.852 --> 38:42.020
I KNOW HOW TO SPEAK TO WOMEN.

38:42.087 --> 38:44.356
I CLEARLY CHOOSE NOT TO.

39:01.740 --> 39:02.974
(grunts)

39:13.752 --> 39:15.654
(water dripping)

39:15.721 --> 39:18.356
WE NEED TO ESTABLISH
THIS BATHROOM
AT THE END OF THE HALL

39:18.424 --> 39:20.526
IS A 100% MASCULINE BATHROOM.

39:20.592 --> 39:23.094
AND FROM THIS MOMENT ON,
IT IS OFF-LIMITS

39:23.161 --> 39:25.063
TO YOU PEOPLE AND YOUR
FOOLISH UNDERGARMENTS.

39:25.130 --> 39:26.264
YOU WANT AN EGG-WHITE OMELET?

39:26.331 --> 39:27.499
DOES THAT MEAN NO YOLKS?

39:27.566 --> 39:28.967
NO YOLKS.
NO, THANKS.

39:29.034 --> 39:30.101
WANT SOME KAMUT FLAKES?

39:30.168 --> 39:31.236
WHAT?

39:31.302 --> 39:33.038
ANCIENT GRAIN.
TASTES GREAT WITH SOYMILK.

39:33.104 --> 39:34.740
SOYMILK.

39:34.806 --> 39:36.041
*(music playing on stereo)

39:36.107 --> 39:37.509
(sniffs)

39:37.576 --> 39:39.310
WHO ATE ALL MY KAMUT FLAKES?

39:39.377 --> 39:41.613
NOT ME.

39:41.680 --> 39:44.550
WHAT AM I,
THE ORGANIZATION
TO END WORLD HUNGER?

39:44.616 --> 39:47.352
THIS IS MY CEREAL.

39:47.419 --> 39:49.320
WHY DO YOU GIRLS
FIND IT NECESSARY

39:49.387 --> 39:52.223
TO LISTEN
TO THIS CONSTANT CRAP?

39:52.290 --> 39:54.325
WHAT'S THE MATTER?
YOU DON'T LIKE
VAGINA MUSIC?

39:54.392 --> 39:57.463
DO YOU HAVE TO USE THAT WORD
BEFORE I'VE HAD
MY COFFEE AND SOYMILK?

39:57.529 --> 39:59.465
VAGINA. VAGINA. VAGINA.

39:59.531 --> 40:00.699
WHOSE?

40:00.766 --> 40:02.333
WHAT DID I TELL Y'ALL
ABOUT WEARING CLOTHES?

40:02.400 --> 40:04.202
JOG BRAS ARE CLOTHES.

40:05.871 --> 40:07.172
THAT'S IT.

40:07.238 --> 40:08.674
THAT'S IT.

40:08.740 --> 40:10.108
THAT IS IT.

40:39.971 --> 40:41.707
JUST SIGN RIGHT THERE.

40:41.773 --> 40:43.575
AWFUL BIG UNIT
FOR A HOUSE THIS SIZE.

40:43.642 --> 40:44.710
I GET HOT.

40:44.776 --> 40:46.144
I HEAR YOU.

40:47.212 --> 40:48.480
(beeping)

40:51.950 --> 40:53.485
(air whooshing)

41:10.435 --> 41:12.504
ALL RIGHT.
YOU WIN, OK?

41:12.571 --> 41:14.305
WE ALL AGREE
TO PUT ON MORE CLOTHES.

41:14.372 --> 41:16.542
NOW, CAN YOU PLEASE
TURN THE TEMPERATURE UP?

41:16.608 --> 41:19.144
THAT'S A VERY MATURE DECISION
AND I'M VERY PROUD
OF YOU GIRLS.

41:19.210 --> 41:21.146
BUT I THINK WE SHOULD COME
TO A COMMON UNDERSTANDING

41:21.212 --> 41:24.282
THE MEANING, THE DEFINITION
OF THE WORD "MORE."

41:25.216 --> 41:26.785
WE THOUGHT
YOU MIGHT SAY THAT.

41:26.852 --> 41:27.953
BARB!

41:29.988 --> 41:31.222
ALL RIGHTY.

41:31.289 --> 41:34.760
THIS IS COURTNEY RYAN,
MY PERSONAL HERO.

41:34.826 --> 41:37.028
AND LIKE COURTNEY,
WE FEEL LIKE WE SHOULD
NOT BE PENALIZED

41:37.095 --> 41:38.864
FOR JUST MAXIMIZING
OUR ASSETS.

41:38.930 --> 41:42.033
HOWEVER, WE'VE ALL AGREED
TO COVER UP

41:42.901 --> 41:44.903
THESE AREAS HERE

41:44.970 --> 41:46.638
AND THIS AREA RIGHT HERE.

41:46.705 --> 41:47.806
GOOD.

41:49.608 --> 41:52.310
BUT WHAT ABOUT
THESE OTHER
PROBLEM AREAS?

41:53.078 --> 41:54.145
HERE

41:55.046 --> 41:56.114
HERE

41:56.948 --> 41:58.083
AND HERE.

41:58.149 --> 41:59.685
(whimpers)

41:59.751 --> 42:01.419
YOU'RE KILLING ME.

42:03.521 --> 42:04.856
COME HERE.

42:11.663 --> 42:13.999
ALL RIGHT.
WE'LL CAVE
ON THE FIRST 2.

42:14.065 --> 42:16.467
BUT WE ABSOLUTELY
MUST MAINTAIN
NAVEL VISIBILITY.

42:16.534 --> 42:18.670
WE WANT TO BE REALISTIC,
NOT AMISH.

42:18.737 --> 42:19.805
ONE INCH ON EITHER SIDE.

42:19.871 --> 42:20.872
3.

42:20.939 --> 42:22.140
2.
DONE.

42:33.619 --> 42:35.553
(Sharp)
THESE GIRLS ARE
A DIFFERENT KETTLE OF WORMS.

42:35.621 --> 42:38.790
UH, SOMETHIN' JUST CAME UP.
I'LL GET BACK TO YOU.

42:39.858 --> 42:42.260
I NEED TO SPEAK
TO YOUR WITNESSES.

42:46.164 --> 42:48.233
EDDIE, HOW'S THE ARM?

42:48.299 --> 42:50.035
LET'S NOT CHANGE THE SUBJECT.

42:50.101 --> 42:51.737
WELL, THERE ARE
NO WITNESSES.

42:51.803 --> 42:54.572
EVEN IF THERE WAS,
I COULDN'T LET YOU
TALK TO THEM. YOU KNOW THAT.

42:54.640 --> 42:57.442
COME ON, CAPTAIN,
WE'RE ON THE SAME TEAM HERE.

42:57.508 --> 42:59.811
I THINK I CAN HELP.

42:59.878 --> 43:01.112
AT LEAST LET ME
TALK TO SHARP.

43:01.179 --> 43:02.547
THAT WAS HIM
ON THE PHONE, RIGHT?

43:02.614 --> 43:04.082
SHARP'S IN
THE FIELD RIGHT NOW.

43:05.583 --> 43:06.752
RIGHT.

43:07.886 --> 43:10.622
YOUR RANGER SCREWED UP
MY WHOLE CASE.

43:10.689 --> 43:12.958
HE BLEW UP THAT LAB
AND ALL THE EVIDENCE IN IT.

43:13.024 --> 43:15.827
BALL IS DEAD
AND I GOT SHOT IN THE ARM,
FOR CHRIST'S SAKE.

43:15.894 --> 43:17.395
NOW, I NEED TO SPEAK
TO THOSE WITNESSES.

43:17.462 --> 43:20.398
SO I'M ASKING YOU AGAIN.
WHERE ARE THEY?

43:24.803 --> 43:26.337
(chuckles)

43:26.404 --> 43:28.473
YOU KNOW, THIS "ONE RIOT,
ONE RANGER" SHIT WON'T FLY

43:28.539 --> 43:30.441
WHEN I SLAP A SUBPOENA
ON YOUR DESK.

43:30.508 --> 43:32.510
MY DESK'S ALREADY A MESS.

43:32.577 --> 43:35.546
HELL, ONE MORE PIECE OF PAPER
WON'T MAKE ME NO NEVER MIND.

43:37.916 --> 43:39.685
CIRCLE THE WAGONS
IF YOU WANT.

43:39.751 --> 43:41.653
THIS IS A FEDERAL CASE.

43:52.097 --> 43:55.801
*(Walkie Talkie Man
by Steriogram playing
on stereo)

43:55.867 --> 43:57.969
* WELL, YOU'RE WALKIN'
AND A TALKIN'
AND A MOVIN' AND A GROOVIN' *

43:58.036 --> 43:59.905
* AND A HIPPIN' AND A HOPPIN'
AND A PICKIN' AND A BOPPIN' *

43:59.971 --> 44:02.107
* THOSE BODS ARE BEING BAD
YOU BETTER TAKE A STAND *

44:02.173 --> 44:04.109
* YOU GONNA WAKE UP
THAT THING IN YOUR HAND *

44:04.175 --> 44:05.210
YOU LEARN QUICK.

44:05.276 --> 44:06.544
5 YEARS OF COLLEGE.

44:06.611 --> 44:07.879
(Sharp)
$13.75, RIGHT?

44:07.946 --> 44:09.380
HERE'S $14.
KEEP THE CHANGE.

44:09.447 --> 44:10.949
HEY, HEY, HEY!

44:13.084 --> 44:14.619
(phone beeping)

44:16.755 --> 44:17.789
SHARP.

44:17.856 --> 44:19.657
HOW'S MY FAVORITE
PEP-SQUAD LEADER?

44:19.725 --> 44:20.859
WHAT?

44:20.926 --> 44:23.028
I SAID, HOW'S MY FAVORITE
PEP-SQUAD LEADER?

44:23.094 --> 44:24.162
NOT REAL PEPPY.

44:24.229 --> 44:26.732
WOULD SOMEBODY
TURN THAT MUSIC DOWN?

44:27.899 --> 44:29.134
HANG ON, CAP.

44:29.200 --> 44:30.936
(Evie)
IS THERE ANY MORE PIZZA LEFT?

44:31.002 --> 44:32.403
* AND A FREAKIN AND A YELLIN

44:32.470 --> 44:35.540
* AND A BOSSIN' AND A SPEAKIN'
AND A LOOKIN' AND A POINTIN' *

44:35.606 --> 44:38.076
SOMEBODY, PLEASE
TURN THAT MUSIC OFF!

44:38.143 --> 44:40.145
(Heather)
THROW THIS AWAY.

44:40.979 --> 44:42.047
(chuckles)

44:42.113 --> 44:44.182
* MY BRIGHT PINK
FLUORO JACKET *

44:44.249 --> 44:46.852
(screaming)
I CANNOT HEAR MYSELF

44:46.918 --> 44:47.919
(softly)
THINK.

44:47.986 --> 44:50.621
(girls)
HEY!

44:50.688 --> 44:54.659
OK, AS WE INVOLUNTARILY
ENTER INTO THIS ENFORCED
PERIOD OF SILENCE,

44:54.726 --> 44:57.262
CAN I ASK
IF THERE'S ANY MEDICATION
YOU FORGOT TO TAKE

44:57.328 --> 44:59.330
OR SOME I MIGHT RECOMMEND
YOU SHOULD TRY?

44:59.397 --> 45:00.398
YES. LIKE TAKE

45:00.465 --> 45:01.867
(all)
A CHILL PILL.

45:01.933 --> 45:03.668
I ONLY NEED ONE WITNESS.

45:03.735 --> 45:04.970
GET OUT.

45:06.772 --> 45:08.807
WHAT'S UP, CAP?

45:08.874 --> 45:11.743
IT'S A SUBPOENA
FROM YOUR BUDDY ZANE.
THE FEDS WANT OUR WITNESSES.

45:11.810 --> 45:13.979
(Captain Nicholas)
WE'RE NOW OFFICIALLY
IN CONTEMPT.

45:14.045 --> 45:15.914
DON'T WORRY IT.
IF CORTLAND
DON'T SEND SOMEBODY

45:15.981 --> 45:17.816
TO KILL THEM PRETTY SOON,
I'LL DO IT MYSELF.

45:17.883 --> 45:21.619
AND ONE OTHER THING.
I GOT THIS INVOICE HERE
FOR AN AIR CONDITIONER.

45:22.153 --> 45:26.657
$7,572.44.

45:26.724 --> 45:27.893
CAN YOU EXPLAIN THAT TO ME?

45:27.959 --> 45:29.795
I'LL HAVE TO GET BACK
TO YOU ON THAT ONE.

45:29.861 --> 45:31.362
WHERE DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE GOIN'?

45:31.429 --> 45:33.999
OH, TO THE CACTUS CAFE.
ASLEEP AT THE WHEEL'S PLAYING.

45:34.065 --> 45:36.802
TOO MANY PEOPLE.
YOU KNOW THE RULES.
NOBODY GOES OUT AFTER DARK.

45:36.868 --> 45:40.371
WE'RE YOUNG, WE'RE STRONG,
AND WE'RE TIRED
OF BEING COOPED UP.

45:40.438 --> 45:43.374
LOOK, I HAVEN'T HAD PHONE SEX
WITH MY BOYFRIEND
IN ALMOST A WEEK.

45:43.441 --> 45:44.876
I HAVE OATS TO PLOW.

45:44.943 --> 45:46.711
YOU GOT OATS TO SOW,
AND IT AIN'T GONNA HAPPEN.

45:46.778 --> 45:48.713
LIKE HELL IT'S NOT.
WHAT'S TO STOP ME

45:48.780 --> 45:51.249
FROM WALKING OUT THAT DOOR?
HUH? THE TONTOS?

45:51.316 --> 45:53.118
PLEASE, I EAT MEN LIKE THAT
FOR BREAKFAST.

45:53.184 --> 45:56.754
AND WHAT, YOU?
I'D LIKE TO SEE YOU
TRY IT, MR. RANGER-MAN.

45:59.090 --> 46:00.325
COME ON.

46:04.963 --> 46:06.497
(screaming in Spanish)

46:11.937 --> 46:13.204
(yelling)

46:15.340 --> 46:17.075
ANYBODY ELSE WANNA GO SEE
ASLEEP AT THE WHEEL?

46:19.310 --> 46:20.846
(girls gasping)

46:21.746 --> 46:23.314
YOU THINK HE NEEDS BACKUP?

46:23.381 --> 46:24.715
(girls screaming)

46:24.782 --> 46:26.484
NO.

46:26.551 --> 46:28.386
I THINK HE CAN HANDLE IT.

46:28.453 --> 46:30.121
(knocking on door)

46:40.265 --> 46:42.767
LET ME GUESS, CLAY.

46:42.834 --> 46:45.603
YOU'RE LOOKING FOR JIMMY.

46:45.670 --> 46:49.307
TOTALLY.
DUDE, ARE YOU LIKE A PSYCHIC
OR SOME KIND OF SHIT?

46:50.308 --> 46:51.977
SOME KIND OF SHIT.

46:52.043 --> 46:53.744
DUDE, THE THING IS

46:53.811 --> 46:55.480
JIMMY MOVED.

46:55.546 --> 46:56.882
OH, WHERE TO?

46:56.948 --> 46:58.884
TRAVIS COUNTY JAILHOUSE.

46:58.950 --> 47:00.551
THAT AIN'T GOOD.

47:06.357 --> 47:07.926
(sighing)

47:07.993 --> 47:12.630
OK, A HAIRDO THIS PHENOMENAL
ONLY HAPPENS, LIKE,
TWICE A YEAR.

47:12.697 --> 47:15.733
PLEASE.
IT REALLY NEEDS
TO BE SHARED WITH THE WORLD.

47:15.800 --> 47:17.635
WHAT IF WE HAVE TO
GO TO THE BATHROOM?

47:17.702 --> 47:18.870
GO AHEAD.

47:18.937 --> 47:20.438
YOU'RE EVIL,
YOU KNOW THAT?

47:20.505 --> 47:22.908
FACE IT, GIRL.
YOU'RE WITH ME TONIGHT.

47:22.974 --> 47:24.709
YOU KNOW,
WE DIDN'T ASK FOR THIS.

47:24.775 --> 47:27.645
WE JUST WENT
INTO THE BATHROOM
AND SAW A GUY DIE.

47:27.712 --> 47:29.480
WE COULD'VE
KEPT OUR MOUTH SHUT,
BUT WE DIDN'T.

47:29.547 --> 47:31.516
AND NOW I FEEL LIKE
WE'RE GETTING PUNISHED FOR IT.

47:31.582 --> 47:33.751
SORRY, BUT YOU'RE
NOT BEING PUNISHED.

47:33.818 --> 47:35.220
THEN LET US OUT OF HERE.

47:35.286 --> 47:38.523
EVEN PRISONERS ON DEATH ROW
GET A LITTLE YARD TIME.

47:38.589 --> 47:39.624
HOW ABOUT THE MALL?

47:39.690 --> 47:41.759
SHOPPING WITH Y'ALL?
I DON'T THINK SO.

47:41.826 --> 47:42.994
WHAT--WHAT ABOUT A MOVIE?

47:43.061 --> 47:44.395
NOT IN THE MOOD.

47:44.462 --> 47:46.164
AS CAPTAIN
OF THE CHEERLEADING SQUAD,

47:46.231 --> 47:47.966
I DEMAND THAT YOU
TAKE US SOMEPLACE

47:48.033 --> 47:50.201
WHERE YOU CAN PROTECT US
AND WE CAN HAVE SOME FUN.

47:50.868 --> 47:52.103
MMM-HMM.

47:54.005 --> 47:56.341
*(Dancing Queen
by ABBA playing)

48:00.445 --> 48:03.081
* YOU CAN DANCE

48:03.148 --> 48:05.550
* YOU CAN JIVE

48:05.616 --> 48:09.120
* HAVING THE TIME
OF YOUR LIFE *

48:09.187 --> 48:12.757
* OOH, SEE THAT GIRL

48:12.823 --> 48:14.492
* WATCH THAT SCENE

48:14.559 --> 48:16.327
* DIG IN THE DANCING QUEEN *

48:16.394 --> 48:17.462
(girls whooping)

48:17.528 --> 48:18.629
(laughing)

48:18.696 --> 48:20.131
(Evie)
LOOK WHO'S SKATING!

48:20.198 --> 48:21.699
(all laughing)

48:25.303 --> 48:29.674
WHOA! WHOA, WHOA, WHOA,
WHOA, WHOA!

48:29.740 --> 48:31.742
LAST TIME I WAS HERE,
IT WAS EMMA'S 6TH BIRTHDAY.

48:31.809 --> 48:33.278
SHE LOVED THIS PLACE.

48:33.344 --> 48:35.046
YOU DON'T SPEAK
TO HER MUCH, DO YOU?

48:35.113 --> 48:36.881
I DON'T THINK EMMA
WANTS TO TALK TO ME.

48:36.948 --> 48:38.749
EVERY GIRL WANTS TO
TALK TO HER DAD.

48:38.816 --> 48:40.885
SHE MAY ACT
LIKE SHE DOESN'T,
BUT SHE DOES.

48:40.952 --> 48:42.687
(Sharp)
EVERYTHING I SAY
AROUND HER IS WRONG.

48:42.753 --> 48:44.889
I'VE BEEN WRONG
SINCE SHE TURNED
11 YEARS OLD.

48:44.956 --> 48:47.792
WELL, MAYBE YOU'RE
JUST NOT ASKING HER
THE RIGHT QUESTIONS.

48:47.858 --> 48:50.495
FIRST OF ALL,
NEVER ASK,
"SO HOW'S SCHOOL?"

48:50.561 --> 48:53.898
NOPE. DUMB QUESTION.
IT'S TOO EASY.
OUR BRAINS JUST SHUT OFF.

48:53.965 --> 48:56.134
(Teresa)
AND DON'T BECOME
HER BEST FRIEND.

48:56.201 --> 48:57.635
WE HAVE ENOUGH FRIENDS,
THANK YOU.

48:57.702 --> 48:59.237
WHAT DO YOU WISH
YOU COULD SAY TO HER?

48:59.304 --> 49:00.405
(whooping)

49:00.471 --> 49:02.440
THAT I WISH I COULD
SEE HER MORE,

49:02.507 --> 49:05.310
AND I'M SORRY
IT DIDN'T WORK OUT
BETWEEN HER MOTHER AND ME,

49:05.376 --> 49:08.346
AND IT WASN'T HER FAULT,
AND--AND STUFF LIKE THAT.

49:08.413 --> 49:09.847
IF MY DADDY TOLD ME
THEM THINGS,

49:09.914 --> 49:11.682
I'D BE
THE HAPPIEST GIRL
ALIVE.

49:11.749 --> 49:14.452
I HAVEN'T SEEN MY DAD
SINCE HE LEFT ME
9 YEARS AGO.

49:14.519 --> 49:15.820
I'M SORRY
THAT HAPPENED
TO YOU.

49:15.886 --> 49:17.422
YOU HAVE A DAUGHTER
AND YOU LOVE HER.

49:17.488 --> 49:19.157
YOU SHOULD TELL HER.

49:19.224 --> 49:21.592
YEAH, MAYBE YOU SHOULD
TAKE HER SKATING AGAIN,
BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT?

49:21.659 --> 49:22.660
(all laughing)

49:22.727 --> 49:23.761
YOU'RE GETTING
PRETTY GOOD.

49:23.828 --> 49:24.829
(all cheering)

49:24.895 --> 49:26.297
YEAH, I AM GETTING
THE HANG OF IT.

49:26.364 --> 49:27.865
ALL RIGHT,
WE'RE GOING TO
LET YOU GO.

49:27.932 --> 49:29.967
SHOW US YOUR FUNKY GROOVE.
COME ON, BOY!

49:30.035 --> 49:31.536
(all whooping)

49:32.303 --> 49:34.905
ALL RIGHT! YES, SIR!

49:34.972 --> 49:36.241
(all screaming)

49:36.307 --> 49:37.742
(all exclaiming)

49:37.808 --> 49:38.876
(grunting)

49:38.943 --> 49:40.745
(Anne)
OH, ARE YOU OK?

49:40.811 --> 49:41.979
(Barb)
THAT WAS BAD.

49:42.747 --> 49:44.482
(people chattering)

49:49.387 --> 49:51.022
MORNING, EMMA.

49:51.089 --> 49:52.323
MR. ZANE?

49:52.390 --> 49:54.492
LOOK AT YOU,
YOU'RE ALL GROWN UP.

49:54.559 --> 49:56.894
YEAH. WOW,
IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME.

49:56.961 --> 49:58.096
SURE HAS.

49:58.163 --> 49:59.597
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

49:59.664 --> 50:01.932
ACTUALLY, I'M LOOKING
FOR YOUR FATHER.
IT'S A PROFESSIONAL MATTER.

50:01.999 --> 50:03.701
YOU GOT ANY IDEA
WHERE I MIGHT FIND HIM?

50:03.768 --> 50:05.636
NO. HE DOESN'T REALLY
TELL ME ANYTHING.

50:05.703 --> 50:06.704
(chuckling)

50:06.771 --> 50:08.273
WHAT HAPPENED
TO YOUR ARM?

50:08.339 --> 50:11.342
OH, IT'S JUST
ONE OF THE HAZARDS
OF THE JOB.

50:11.409 --> 50:13.878
YOU WOULDN'T HAPPEN
TO HAVE A NUMBER
ON HIM, WOULD YOU?

50:13.944 --> 50:15.546
IS HE IN TROUBLE?

50:15.613 --> 50:17.215
OH, NO, NO, NO.
IT'S JUST THAT
I'M WORKING ON A CASE

50:17.282 --> 50:19.016
AND, UH, I NEED HIS HELP.

50:19.084 --> 50:21.152
OK, WELL, I MEAN,
IF I NEED TO GET
AHOLD OF HIM,

50:21.219 --> 50:24.355
I USUALLY JUST CALL DISPATCH
AND THEY PATCH ME THROUGH
ON A RESTRICTED LINE.

50:24.422 --> 50:25.556
I'LL GIVE THAT
A TRY THEN.

50:25.623 --> 50:26.724
OK.

50:26.791 --> 50:28.726
GOOD TO
SEE YOU AGAIN.
BYE.

50:33.531 --> 50:36.101

50:36.167 --> 50:38.936

50:39.003 --> 50:41.872
RIFLE FROM HIS TRUNK
MATCHES THE BULLET
THEY DUG OUT OF SWANSON.

50:41.939 --> 50:45.276
IS THIS THE FELLA Y'ALL SEE
SHOOT MORGAN BALL?

50:45.343 --> 50:48.146
NO. THE GUY WHO SHOT BALL
SEEMED A LOT NICER.

50:48.213 --> 50:49.914
UH-HUH,
AND A LOT LESS DEAD.

50:49.980 --> 50:51.349

51:36.427 --> 51:39.564
THIS MAN'S PROBABLY GOT
A LOT OF SINS
HE NEEDS TO CONFESS.

51:39.630 --> 51:41.466
PROBABLY MAY HAVE TO
EXORCISE HIM.

51:41.532 --> 51:44.769
Y'ALL GO ABOUT YOUR BUSINESS,

51:44.835 --> 51:46.671

57:22.006 --> 57:24.475
YOU DO THEIR SHOPPING
FOR THEM?

57:24.542 --> 57:27.111
YOU ARE A CURIOUS FELLA,
MR. SHARP. YOU GAY?

57:27.177 --> 57:30.280
NO. GIRLS ARE ALL TIED UP,
STUDYIN'.

57:30.347 --> 57:32.883
AND I VOLUNTEERED TO HELP OUT
AND PICK UP A FEW THINGS.

57:32.950 --> 57:35.986
ARE YOU SLEEPING
WITH ANY OR POSSIBLY ALL
OF THESE GIRLS?

57:36.053 --> 57:37.287
NO.

57:37.354 --> 57:38.689
WANNA HAVE DINNER WITH ME
TOMORROW NIGHT?

57:38.756 --> 57:40.024
NEGATIVE.

57:41.091 --> 57:42.593
NEGATIVE?

57:42.660 --> 57:45.395
IT'S NOT REALLY POSSIBLE,
WHAT WITH WORK AND ALL.

57:45.462 --> 57:47.231
WELL, OK,

57:47.297 --> 57:48.599
THAT PLANE JUST FLEW
INTO THE SIDE
OF THE MOUNTAIN.

57:48.666 --> 57:50.234
CALL OFF THE SEARCH,
NO SURVIVORS.

57:50.300 --> 57:51.802
HAVE A PLEASANT EVENING.

58:08.519 --> 58:09.920
THESE YOURS?

58:12.289 --> 58:13.323
YES.

58:13.390 --> 58:14.859
YOU LEFT THEM
ON THE COUNTER.

58:14.925 --> 58:16.561
THANK YOU.

58:16.627 --> 58:17.995
(car beeps)

58:22.299 --> 58:23.668
(chuckling)

58:24.234 --> 58:25.636
THANK YOU.

58:25.703 --> 58:28.138
I THINK I MADE A MISTAKE
BACK THERE.

58:28.205 --> 58:29.473
DIDN'T WANT
THE WINGS AFTER ALL?

58:29.540 --> 58:31.241
NO. IN REGARD TO DINNER.

58:31.308 --> 58:33.310
IT'S NOT THAT
I DON'T WANT TO.

58:33.377 --> 58:35.179
IT'S JUST THAT IT'S HARD
FOR ME TO GET AWAY
WITH MY BUSY SCHEDULE

58:35.245 --> 58:38.549
AS AN ASSISTANT
CHEERLEADING COACH.

58:38.616 --> 58:42.019
YEAH, WELL, THIS WHOLE
CHEERLEADING THING MUST BE
A REALLY TOUGH RACKET.

58:42.086 --> 58:44.121
YOU HAVE NO IDEA.

58:44.188 --> 58:45.756
ANYWAY, I WAS THINKIN',

58:45.823 --> 58:47.124
IF YOU'RE NOT OPPOSED TO IT,
MAYBE YOU COULD COME OVER

58:47.191 --> 58:49.059
TO THE HOUSE TOMORROW NIGHT
AND I'LL FIX DINNER.

58:54.865 --> 58:55.900
OK.

58:57.702 --> 58:58.736
8:00?

58:58.803 --> 59:00.170
YEAH, GOOD.

59:02.172 --> 59:03.207
OK.

59:05.175 --> 59:07.344
BY THE WAY, I'M MOLLY.

59:07.878 --> 59:09.313
I'M ROLAND.

59:09.379 --> 59:12.149
ROLAND. OK, ROLAND.

59:15.720 --> 59:17.321
YOU'RE NOT
ON THE ZONE
OR COUNTING POINTS

59:17.387 --> 59:19.624
OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT,
ARE YOU?

59:20.457 --> 59:21.491
NO.

59:28.465 --> 59:31.068
(Heather)
IS THAT THE NORTH STAR?

59:31.135 --> 59:33.604
NO. I THINK
THAT'S AN AIRPLANE.

59:33.671 --> 59:36.807
YOU SEE-- YOU SEE
THE WAY IT'S MOVING?

59:36.874 --> 59:39.209
THAT'S THE NORTH STAR.

59:39.276 --> 59:42.847
SO THAT'S WHERE
THEY'VE BEEN KEEPING IT.

59:42.913 --> 59:45.616
SOMEDAY I WANT TO DO MORE
THAN LOOK AT THE STARS.

59:45.683 --> 59:47.985
I'M FIXING
TO SOAR WITH THEM.

59:48.052 --> 59:50.888
WHAT, YOU MEAN,
LIKE AN ASTRONAUT
OR SOMETHING?

59:50.955 --> 59:54.725
NO, NOT EXACTLY.
NOT A LIVING ONE,
AT LEAST.

59:54.792 --> 59:56.827
YOU SEE, THEY GOT
THIS COMPANY
OUT OF BEAUMONT

59:56.894 --> 59:58.262
ALL RIGHT.

59:58.328 --> 01:00:00.064
AND THEY WILL
LAUNCH YOUR REMAINS
RIGHT OUT INTO OUTER SPACE.

01:00:00.130 --> 01:00:02.432
REALLY?
I LOVE SHIT LIKE THAT.
YEAH.

01:00:02.499 --> 01:00:03.567
BUT HOW?

01:00:03.634 --> 01:00:04.969
THEY--THEY--
WHAT THEY DO IS
THEY PARK YOU--

01:00:05.035 --> 01:00:07.437
HOLT, WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOIN'?

01:00:09.206 --> 01:00:11.575
CONTEMPLATING THE VASTNESS
OF THE UNIVERSE, SIR.

01:00:11.642 --> 01:00:12.743
(girl screaming)

01:00:12.810 --> 01:00:14.278
(packets thudding)

01:00:22.519 --> 01:00:24.722
(crying)
IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE RED.

01:00:24.789 --> 01:00:27.024
DOES THIS LOOK
LIKE RED TO YOU?

01:00:27.091 --> 01:00:30.427
JUST SHOOT HER, SHARP.
YOU'D BE DOIN' HER A FAVOR.

01:00:30.494 --> 01:00:31.829
WHERE ARE TERESA AND ANNE?

01:00:31.896 --> 01:00:32.897
I--I DON'T KNOW.

01:00:32.963 --> 01:00:34.231
YOU'RE LYING.

01:00:34.298 --> 01:00:36.000
(chuckling)
HOW DO YOU KNOW?

01:00:36.066 --> 01:00:37.134
YOU BROKE EYE CONTACT.

01:00:37.201 --> 01:00:39.569
IT'S A SIGN OF STRESS
AND POSSIBLE DECEPTION.

01:00:39.636 --> 01:00:42.339
SO, BY THE WAY,
IS PICKIN' AT YOUR CLOTHES.
STOP PICKING AT YOUR CLOTHES.

01:00:42.406 --> 01:00:44.909
LOOK ME IN THE EYE
AND TELL ME WHERE THEY'RE AT.

01:00:44.975 --> 01:00:46.744
TERESA AND ANTONIO
HAD A REALLY BIG FIGHT.

01:00:46.811 --> 01:00:48.112
SHE HAD TO
BLOW OFF SOME STEAM,

01:00:48.178 --> 01:00:49.914
SO THEY WENT
TO THE BUFFALO BILLIARDS.

01:00:52.149 --> 01:00:53.483
YOU STAY HERE.

01:00:53.550 --> 01:00:56.653
DON'T BE
CONTEMPLATING THE UNIVERSE
WITH ANYBODY.

01:00:56.721 --> 01:00:58.622
*(Who Invited You
by The Donnas playing)

01:00:58.689 --> 01:01:01.191
* I'M BUSY TALKING
TO THIS GUY *

01:01:01.258 --> 01:01:04.461
* WHEN I SEE OUTTA THE CORNER
OF MY EYE *

01:01:04.528 --> 01:01:06.130
(girls laughing)

01:01:07.865 --> 01:01:10.034
* WHY DON'T YOU TELL ME
WHO LET YOU IN *

01:01:10.100 --> 01:01:14.038
LOOK, A NATIVE APPROACHES.
AVOID EYE CONTACT.

01:01:14.104 --> 01:01:16.273
* 'CAUSE WE DO
AND WE DON'T CARE *

01:01:16.340 --> 01:01:18.142
* IF YOU HAD MORE FUN
IN SUNDAY SCHOOL *

01:01:18.208 --> 01:01:19.676
YOU GUYS
ARE THE CHEERLEADERS,
RIGHT?

01:01:19.744 --> 01:01:21.078
THE ONES WITH THE CALENDAR?

01:01:21.145 --> 01:01:22.179
NOPE.

01:01:22.246 --> 01:01:23.881
COULD HAVE SWORN
YOU WERE JUNE.

01:01:23.948 --> 01:01:25.215
JUNE KICKS ASS.

01:01:25.282 --> 01:01:27.251
HMM, SORRY, WRONG GIRL.

01:01:27.317 --> 01:01:32.089
WELL, ME AND MY BUDDIES
OVER THERE, WE GO TO,
LIKE, EVERY GAME.

01:01:32.156 --> 01:01:33.590
HAVE YOU SEEN US?

01:01:33.657 --> 01:01:35.793
YEAH. YEAH.

01:01:35.860 --> 01:01:38.195
I THOUGHT I RECOGNIZED
YOU GUYS.

01:01:38.262 --> 01:01:40.130
YOU GUYS WERE THE ONES
GETTING REALLY DRUNK

01:01:40.197 --> 01:01:42.366
GOING, "WOO, WOO,
WOO, WOO," RIGHT?

01:01:42.432 --> 01:01:43.700
(chuckling)
YOU SAW US.

01:01:43.768 --> 01:01:45.369
NO.

01:01:45.435 --> 01:01:47.304
YOUR SCHOOL SPIRIT SUCKS.

01:01:47.371 --> 01:01:50.941
I'M CAPTAIN
OF THE CHEER SQUAD.
OUR SCHOOL SPIRIT KICKS ASS.

01:01:51.008 --> 01:01:55.079
YEAH, AND IT'S GETTING HIT ON
BY IDIOTS LIKE YOU
THAT REALLY SUCKS.

01:01:55.145 --> 01:01:57.681
YOU'RE A SASSY BITCH.
I LIKE THAT.

01:01:58.816 --> 01:01:59.950
GET YOUR HANDS--

01:02:00.017 --> 01:02:01.819
(glass shattering)
(man)
HANG ON NOW.

01:02:01.886 --> 01:02:05.655
(Sharp)
EVERYBODY COOL OFF.
WE'VE HAD ENOUGH FUN TONIGHT.

01:02:05.722 --> 01:02:07.391
(groaning)

01:02:07.457 --> 01:02:08.859
NOW I'VE HAD ENOUGH FUN.

01:02:08.926 --> 01:02:10.227
WAS THAT COMPLETELY NECESSARY?

01:02:10.294 --> 01:02:13.663
YOU COULD SERIOUSLY INJURE
A YOUNG MAN BY DOING THAT.

01:02:17.968 --> 01:02:19.469
(man grunting)

01:02:21.005 --> 01:02:22.907
(girls scream)

01:02:22.973 --> 01:02:24.374
I SHOULD WARN YOU.

01:02:24.441 --> 01:02:26.777
(grunting)
I KNOW KARATE.

01:02:26.844 --> 01:02:28.846
YOU BETTER KNOW SOMETHIN'.

01:02:28.913 --> 01:02:31.315
(groaning)

01:02:31.381 --> 01:02:33.851
ANY OF THE REST OF YOU BOYS
HERE IN THIS POOL HALL
WANNA PLAY THE WINNER?

01:02:34.751 --> 01:02:36.420
(people murmuring)

01:02:45.229 --> 01:02:47.231
WE HAD THE SITUATION
UNDER CONTROL.

01:02:47.297 --> 01:02:50.868
YEAH. WE WERE
ABOUT TO GO ALL BUFFY
ON THEIR GRINGO ASSES.

01:03:03.280 --> 01:03:05.015
I BROUGHT YOU A PILLOW.

01:03:05.082 --> 01:03:07.417
IT'S BETTER THAN THE ONES
YOU'VE BEEN USING.

01:03:07.484 --> 01:03:10.487
BUCKWHEAT HULLS.
IT'S GOOD FOR NECK SUPPORT.

01:03:11.121 --> 01:03:12.456
THANK YOU.

01:03:14.024 --> 01:03:16.360
THAT WAS COOL WHAT YOU DID
FOR THE GIRLS.

01:03:17.862 --> 01:03:19.263
IT WAS COOL.

01:03:21.098 --> 01:03:22.967
THAT'S ONE BIG
HONKING BULLET.

01:03:23.033 --> 01:03:25.302
YOU FIXIN' TO SEND
A MONKEY UP IN THAT THING?

01:03:25.369 --> 01:03:28.705
THAT THING IS
A PERSONNEL
SUPPRESSOR DELUXE.

01:03:28.772 --> 01:03:32.242
PERSONNEL SUPPRESSOR?
YOU MEAN KILLING?

01:03:32.309 --> 01:03:34.311
WELL, CAN'T YOU JUST
WOUND THEM OR SOMETHING?

01:03:34.378 --> 01:03:36.046
SHOOT THE GUN
OUT OF THEIR HAND?

01:03:36.113 --> 01:03:37.481
NO, IT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

01:03:41.551 --> 01:03:44.288
YOU'RE NOT REALLY
THE CHEERLEADING TYPE,
ARE YOU?

01:03:44.354 --> 01:03:46.790
FOR ME, IT'S MORE PENANCE
THAN A PASSION.

01:03:46.857 --> 01:03:49.626
RELIGIOUS ASCETICS
WEAR A HAIR SHIRT,
I CARRY THE POM-POMS.

01:03:49.693 --> 01:03:50.694
HMM.

01:03:50.760 --> 01:03:52.863
I DON'T KNOW.

01:03:52.930 --> 01:03:56.033
I GUESS
IT'S THE DUALITY OF MAN,
YOU KNOW?

01:03:56.100 --> 01:03:58.402
"THAT JUNGIAN THING, SIR."

01:03:58.468 --> 01:04:00.537
MATTHEW MODINE,
FULL METAL JACKET.

01:04:00.604 --> 01:04:03.273
PEACE SIGN
ON ONE SIDE OF HIS HELMET,
"BORN TO KILL" ON THE OTHER.

01:04:03.340 --> 01:04:05.242
IT'S MY FAVORITE MOVIE.

01:04:05.943 --> 01:04:06.944
(clinking)

01:04:07.011 --> 01:04:08.045
(clicking)

01:04:08.112 --> 01:04:10.847
MY FAVORITE MOVIE
IS THE SOUND OF MUSIC.

01:04:13.250 --> 01:04:14.584
(sizzling)

01:04:17.487 --> 01:04:19.389
"WHAT'S IN A NAME?

01:04:19.456 --> 01:04:24.228
"THAT WHICH WE CALL A ROSE
BY ANY OTHER NAME
WOULD SMELL AS SWEET"

01:04:24.294 --> 01:04:25.930
I DON'T UNDERSTAND
ANY OF THIS.

01:04:25.996 --> 01:04:27.197
PRETTY SIMPLE, REALLY.

01:04:27.264 --> 01:04:29.599
SHE'S A CAPULET,
HE'S A MONTAGUE.

01:04:29.666 --> 01:04:31.835
THE 2 FAMILIES HAVE ALWAYS
HATED EACH OTHER

01:04:31.902 --> 01:04:34.271
AND THEY ALWAYS
WILL HATE EACH OTHER.

01:04:34.338 --> 01:04:36.306
WELL,
WHY COULDN'T SHAKESPEARE
JUST SAY IT LIKE THAT?

01:04:36.373 --> 01:04:37.741
HE COULD HAVE.

01:04:37.807 --> 01:04:41.045
BUT NOBODY WOULD
BE TALKIN' ABOUT IT
410 YEARS LATER.

01:04:41.111 --> 01:04:42.980
HOW DO YOU KNOW SO MUCH
ABOUT ROMEO AND JULIET?

01:04:43.047 --> 01:04:44.314
I READ THE PLAY.

01:04:44.381 --> 01:04:45.615
WHY WOULD YOU
READ THE PLAY?

01:04:45.682 --> 01:04:47.517
MOLLY'S COMIN' OVER
FOR DINNER TONIGHT.

01:04:47.584 --> 01:04:48.919
WHO'S MOLLY?

01:04:48.986 --> 01:04:50.654
PROFESSOR McCARTHY.

01:04:50.720 --> 01:04:52.356
YOU CALL HER MOLLY?

01:04:52.422 --> 01:04:55.192
UH, THIS WHOLE HOUSE
TOTALLY REEKS.
WHAT IS THAT SMELL?

01:04:55.259 --> 01:04:57.761
5 ALARM CHILI.
IT'S MY SPECIALTY.

01:04:57.827 --> 01:05:01.398
UH, YOU'RE PUTTING MEAT
INTO MY LENTIL POT?

01:05:01.465 --> 01:05:03.233
HE'S MAKING DINNER
FOR MOLLY.

01:05:03.300 --> 01:05:04.368
WHO'S MOLLY?

01:05:04.434 --> 01:05:06.836
UH, PROFESSOR McCARTHY,
INTRO TO ENGLISH LIT.

01:05:06.903 --> 01:05:09.273
OH, I HAD HER
LAST QUARTER.
SHE'S A BABE.

01:05:09.339 --> 01:05:10.574
AND THIS IS WHAT
YOU'RE SERVING HER?

01:05:10.640 --> 01:05:12.242
IT'S HIS SPECIALTY.

01:05:12.309 --> 01:05:13.677
MY WIFE LOVED MY CHILI.

01:05:13.743 --> 01:05:16.146
YOUR WIFE
LEFT YOUR GASSY OLD ASS.

01:05:16.213 --> 01:05:17.347
WHAT'S GOIN' ON?

01:05:17.414 --> 01:05:18.682
(both)
SHARP'S GOT A DATE.

01:05:18.748 --> 01:05:20.284
(all chuckling)

01:05:24.088 --> 01:05:25.555
(Heather)
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA WEAR?

01:05:25.622 --> 01:05:27.324
(Sharp)
CLOTHES.
PANTS, SPORT COAT.

01:05:27.391 --> 01:05:28.625
OH, NOT THAT
BUTT-UGLY THING.

01:05:28.692 --> 01:05:29.793
I LIKE THAT SPORT COAT.

01:05:29.859 --> 01:05:31.461
(Evie)
OK, I GRABBED
EVERYTHING I COULD FIND.

01:05:31.528 --> 01:05:33.830
WHAT COMES FIRST,
ASTRINGENT OR
EXFOLIATING LOTION?

01:05:33.897 --> 01:05:35.332
I DON'T USE THAT STUFF.

01:05:35.399 --> 01:05:37.101
YOU ARE. YOU'VE GOT PORES
THE SIZE OF MANHOLE COVERS.

01:05:37.167 --> 01:05:41.405
AND THE EARS, THE NOSE.
WE BETTER DO SOMETHING
ABOUT ALL THIS HAIR.

01:05:41.471 --> 01:05:43.873
YEAH, AND YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU CAN USE SOME BRONZER.
YOU NEED SOME COLOR.

01:05:43.940 --> 01:05:44.975
I DON'T BRONZE.

01:05:45.042 --> 01:05:46.576
OH, YOU'LL BRONZE,
WHITE BOY.

01:05:46.643 --> 01:05:48.245
I HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFULLY
GROOMING MYSELF

01:05:48.312 --> 01:05:50.147
FOR A LOT LONGER
THAN ANY OF Y'ALL
HAVE BEEN ALIVE.

01:05:50.214 --> 01:05:52.449
YEAH, WELL,
SOME THINGS HAVE CHANGED
SINCE YOU WERE YOUNG.

01:05:52.516 --> 01:05:54.918
WE'VE DISCOVERED FIRE
AND THE WHEEL.

01:05:54.985 --> 01:05:57.821
SHE'S RIGHT.
AND IF YOU WANNA GET OVER,
YOU BETTER LISTEN TO US.

01:05:57.887 --> 01:05:59.089
I'M NOT GETTIN' OVER.
I'M HAVIN' DINNER.

01:05:59.156 --> 01:06:00.424
NOT LOOKING LIKE THAT
YOU WON'T.

01:06:00.490 --> 01:06:02.859
BARB, CAN YOU DO ANYTHING
WITH THE HAIR?

01:06:02.926 --> 01:06:04.161
SHAVE IT ALL OFF.

01:06:04.228 --> 01:06:06.363
GO TALK TO HER.
GIVE ME THAT.

01:06:07.764 --> 01:06:09.566
BARB.

01:06:09.633 --> 01:06:13.737
COME ON. I MEAN,
IT'S NEVER GONNA WORK OUT
BETWEEN YOU AND SHARP.

01:06:13.803 --> 01:06:15.272
HE'S OLD ENOUGH TO BE YOUR

(chuckling)
GREAT-GREAT-GREAT-GREAT
GRANDFATHER.

01:06:21.211 --> 01:06:23.480
AND YOU HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY
TO HELP HIM.

01:06:23.547 --> 01:06:25.049
YOU WENT TO BEAUTY SCHOOL.

01:06:25.749 --> 01:06:27.717
I FLUNKED OUT.

01:06:27.784 --> 01:06:29.753
(whispering)
I KNOW.

01:06:29.819 --> 01:06:31.188
BUT HE DOESN'T KNOW THAT.

01:06:34.124 --> 01:06:36.960
*(I'm Too Sexy
by Right Said Fred playing)

01:06:39.763 --> 01:06:44.034

* I'M TOO SEXY *

01:07:04.988 --> 01:07:07.191
(Anne)
OK, LET'S FOCUS
ON THE CONVERSATION.

01:07:07.257 --> 01:07:08.658
HOW ARE YOU
GONNA GET THINGS ROLLING?

01:07:08.725 --> 01:07:10.094
I DON'T KNOW.

01:07:10.160 --> 01:07:11.928
IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME
SINCE I WENT OUT ON A DATE.

01:07:11.995 --> 01:07:15.199
THAT'S OK. UM,
LOOK, JUST GIVE US
A LITTLE PREVIEW.

01:07:16.666 --> 01:07:17.967
I'M HER.

01:07:18.034 --> 01:07:19.703
I COME IN.

01:07:19.769 --> 01:07:20.937
GO.

01:07:21.004 --> 01:07:23.173
WELL, I'LL START OUT
BY SAYIN' "HELLO."

01:07:23.240 --> 01:07:24.908
NO, I'LL SAY "HI."

01:07:26.276 --> 01:07:28.412
NO, "HELLO" IS BETTER.
I THINK.

01:07:28.478 --> 01:07:30.347
I'LL WAIT AND SEE
HOW I FEEL AT THE TIME.

01:07:30.414 --> 01:07:33.750
THEN I'LL PROBABLY
START OUT SAYIN'--

01:07:33.817 --> 01:07:35.819
ASKIN' HER IF SHE EVER...

01:07:38.122 --> 01:07:39.156
OH.

01:07:40.624 --> 01:07:42.926
WE'LL START TALKIN'
ABOUT, UH...

01:07:45.929 --> 01:07:47.831
I'M IN DEEP SHIT, AIN'T I?

01:07:50.267 --> 01:07:52.669
(all exclaiming)

01:07:52.736 --> 01:07:54.204
(Evie)
WHO KNEW YOU WERE SUCH A BABE?

01:07:54.271 --> 01:07:56.306
YEAH. EVEN IF YOU DIDN'T
LET US FROST YOUR TIPS.

01:07:56.373 --> 01:07:57.974
YOU CLEAN UP
PRETTY NICE, SERGEANT.

01:07:58.041 --> 01:07:59.609
YOU'RE ALL THAT
AND THEN SOME.

01:07:59.676 --> 01:08:00.677
THANK YOU.

01:08:00.744 --> 01:08:03.213
REMEMBER,
A WOMAN IS LIKE A HORSE.

01:08:03.280 --> 01:08:06.516
SHE LIKES TO KNOW
THAT THE GUY ON THE SADDLE
HAS A TIGHT GRIP ON THE REINS.

01:08:06.583 --> 01:08:08.818
EXCUSE ME,
A WOMAN IS NOT A HORSE.

01:08:08.885 --> 01:08:10.420
JUST BE YOURSELF.

01:08:10.487 --> 01:08:12.922
I'M NOT SO SURE
BEING HIMSELF IS GOING
IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION.

01:08:12.989 --> 01:08:16.826
OK. JUST BE YOURSELF,
BUT NOT THE YOU
WHO YOU REALLY ARE.

01:08:16.893 --> 01:08:19.895
BE THE YOU WHO YOU WOULD BE
IF YOU WERE SOMEBODY ELSE.

01:08:19.962 --> 01:08:21.096
SOMEBODY BETTER.

01:08:21.165 --> 01:08:22.799
THAT'S WHAT I MEAN.
SOMEBODY BETTER.

01:08:22.866 --> 01:08:24.134
MAYBE WE OUGHT TO
CALL THIS OFF.

01:08:24.201 --> 01:08:25.301
OK.

01:08:25.368 --> 01:08:26.903
(all)
NO!
(doorbell rings)

01:08:26.970 --> 01:08:29.104
IT'S TOO LATE.
OK, NOW, JUST DON'T BE
THE SCHIZOID SHARP.

01:08:29.173 --> 01:08:31.408
BE THE SHARP
WHO EMBRACES LIFE.

01:08:36.712 --> 01:08:40.082
NOW, DON'T WORRY.
WE'LL BE WITH YOU
EVERY STEP OF THE WAY.

01:08:44.888 --> 01:08:46.756
CAN YOU HEAR ME?

01:08:46.823 --> 01:08:49.225
CAN YOU HEAR ME NOW?

01:08:49.292 --> 01:08:50.394

(bell rings)

01:08:54.096 --> 01:08:55.999
JUST TAKE THESE.

01:08:56.064 --> 01:08:57.834
(footsteps receding)

01:09:00.404 --> 01:09:01.470
GET!

01:09:08.312 --> 01:09:09.679
HELLO.

01:09:14.584 --> 01:09:15.652
SHH.

01:09:23.158 --> 01:09:25.060
TELL HER
SHE LOOKS NICE.

01:09:26.930 --> 01:09:27.964
YOU LOOK NICE.

01:09:28.765 --> 01:09:31.501
THANK YOU. SO DO YOU.

01:09:31.568 --> 01:09:33.036
NIFTY JACKET.

01:09:35.104 --> 01:09:36.740
GIVE HER THE FLOWERS.

01:09:36.805 --> 01:09:38.274
THE GIRLS THOUGHT
YOU MIGHT LIKE THOSE.

01:09:38.341 --> 01:09:39.876
NO, THEY WERE
YOUR IDEA.

01:09:39.943 --> 01:09:43.747
THEY'RE MY IDEA,
BUT THE GIRLS THOUGHT
YOU MIGHT LIKE THOSE.

01:09:45.081 --> 01:09:47.783
WELL, THEY WERE RIGHT.

01:09:47.850 --> 01:09:48.885
THEY'RE NOT HERE,
ARE THEY?

01:09:48.952 --> 01:09:50.086
NO.

01:09:50.153 --> 01:09:52.087
GOOD. THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN
A LITTLE AWKWARD.

01:09:52.154 --> 01:09:53.723
YES. REAL AWKWARD.

01:09:54.958 --> 01:09:56.260
TAKE THE WINE.

01:09:57.060 --> 01:09:58.495
TAKE IT.

01:09:58.562 --> 01:10:00.564
I-I'LL JUST GO OPEN THIS.

01:10:03.400 --> 01:10:04.668

01:10:10.474 --> 01:10:12.208
(whispering)
WHERE DO YOU KEEP
THE CORKSCREW?

01:10:12.276 --> 01:10:14.478
LEFT OF THE SINK, TOP DRAWER.

01:10:20.517 --> 01:10:21.518

01:10:26.390 --> 01:10:28.392
LOOK.

01:10:28.458 --> 01:10:30.927
BASE TO RANGER ONE,
WE'VE GOT A MAKEUP CHECK
IN THE DINING ROOM.

01:10:30.994 --> 01:10:32.629
I REPEAT, MAKEUP CHECK
IN THE DINING ROOM.

01:10:32.696 --> 01:10:34.030
WHAT THE HELL DOES THAT MEAN?

01:10:34.097 --> 01:10:37.133
IT MEANS SHE DIGS YOU, MAN.
NOW, LOOSEN THE HELL UP.

01:10:38.468 --> 01:10:40.270
(clattering)

01:10:40.337 --> 01:10:41.338
(sighing)

01:10:46.710 --> 01:10:48.044
THANK YOU.

01:10:49.045 --> 01:10:50.213
ROOT BEER.

01:10:50.280 --> 01:10:52.782
I GAVE UP ALCOHOL
ABOUT 10 YEARS AGO.

01:10:52.849 --> 01:10:54.751
DIDN'T LIKE YOURSELF
WHEN YOU WERE DRINKIN', HUH?

01:10:54.818 --> 01:10:56.286
HELL, I LOVED MYSELF
WHEN I DRANK.

01:10:56.353 --> 01:10:58.988
IT WAS OTHER PEOPLE
THAT HAD THE PROBLEM.

01:11:00.724 --> 01:11:01.758
HE'S A DORK.

01:11:02.426 --> 01:11:03.627
(chuckling)

01:11:06.830 --> 01:11:09.132
WELL, WHY DON'T I, UH,
PUT THESE IN SOME WATER.

01:11:09.198 --> 01:11:11.468
YEAH.

01:11:11.535 --> 01:11:13.269
ALL RIGHT, LOOK,
YOU GOT A LAUGH.

01:11:13.337 --> 01:11:15.905
NOW GO TO THE TABLE
AND LIGHT THE CANDLES.

01:11:15.972 --> 01:11:18.274
NO, THAT'S
SUCH A LAME MOVE.

01:11:18.342 --> 01:11:20.109
CANDLES ARE
A TOTAL CLICHE.

01:11:20.176 --> 01:11:21.378
(Anne)
WHAT DO YOU KNOW
ABOUT CLICHES?

01:11:21.445 --> 01:11:22.879
YOU'VE GOT A WATERBED.

01:11:22.946 --> 01:11:25.048
I SAY, LIGHT THE CANDLE.
IT'S SEXY.

01:11:25.114 --> 01:11:27.417
(Teresa)
HE MIGHT AS WELL PULL OUT
THE BEARSKIN RUG

01:11:27.484 --> 01:11:29.486
AND THE DISCO BALL,
FOR GOD'S SAKE.

01:11:29.553 --> 01:11:31.087
I NEED CONFIRMATION.

01:11:31.154 --> 01:11:34.324
IS LIGHTING THE CANDLE
A COOL MOVE
OR NOT A COOL MOVE?

01:11:34.391 --> 01:11:36.192
FINE.

01:11:36.259 --> 01:11:37.727
ALL IN FAVOR
OF CANDLES?

01:11:37.794 --> 01:11:38.928

01:11:38.995 --> 01:11:40.364

01:11:40.430 --> 01:11:41.465
(snickering)

01:11:41.531 --> 01:11:42.732
MISSION CONTROL TO SHARP.

01:11:42.799 --> 01:11:44.568
LIGHT THOSE CANDLES.

01:11:52.175 --> 01:11:53.877
(Molly)
OH, I DON'T KNOW.

01:11:53.943 --> 01:11:56.179
SO MANY OF MY COLLEAGUES
JUST STICK IT OUT

01:11:56.245 --> 01:11:58.982
FOR THE PAYCHECK
AND THE BENEFITS.

01:11:59.048 --> 01:12:01.217
OR, IN MY EX-HUSBAND'S CASE

01:12:01.284 --> 01:12:04.954
FOR THE ENDLESS SUPPLY
OF FRESH, YOUNG COEDS.

01:12:05.021 --> 01:12:09.125
BUT WHY WOULD A MAN
WANT TO BE WITH A GIRL
WHEN HE CAN BE WITH A WOMAN?

01:12:09.192 --> 01:12:11.961
OR IN YOUR CASE,
WITH 5 GIRLS.

01:12:13.663 --> 01:12:16.065
WHAT IS YOUR STORY?

01:12:16.132 --> 01:12:19.302
MY WORK BECAME MY MISTRESS.

01:12:19.369 --> 01:12:21.270

THAT WAS ALL I HAD.

* THAT IT WAS ONLY YESTERDAY

(chuckling)
NO, I MEAN HERE.

01:13:19.896 --> 01:13:22.732
WHAT IS A MAN LIKE YOU
DOING IN THIS HOUSE?

01:13:24.734 --> 01:13:26.269
WELL, IT'S, UH,

AND I VENTURE TO GUESS
IT HAS NOTHING TO DO
WITH CHEERLEADING, DOES IT?

01:13:36.412 --> 01:13:37.881
NOT MUCH, NO.

01:13:39.649 --> 01:13:41.084

OH, NO, NO, NO.
THERE'S NO NIXING
THE HEX.

01:15:56.853 --> 01:15:58.087
IT MUST GO ON.

01:15:58.154 --> 01:16:00.056
YOU CAN'T STOP THE HEX,
MR. RANGER-MAN.
YEAH.

01:16:00.123 --> 01:16:01.157
IT'S BIGGER
THAN ALL OF US.

01:16:01.224 --> 01:16:02.258
IS THAT RIGHT?

01:16:02.325 --> 01:16:04.794
IF WE WERE DOCTORS,
WE'D CURE CANCER.

01:16:04.861 --> 01:16:07.330
I-I-IF WE WERE NURSES,
WE'D GIVE PEOPLE SHOTS.

01:16:07.396 --> 01:16:11.367
IF WE WERE ASTRONAUTS,
WE WOULD DO OTHER THINGS.

01:16:11.434 --> 01:16:14.003
BUT WE'RE NOT.
WE'RE CHEERLEADERS.

01:16:14.070 --> 01:16:16.105
AND WE'RE GOIN'
TO THE HEX RALLY,
YOU KNOW.

01:16:16.172 --> 01:16:17.540
YOU DON'T RESPECT
CHEERLEADING, DO YOU?

01:16:17.607 --> 01:16:18.708
NO.

01:16:18.775 --> 01:16:20.710
THAT'S BECAUSE
YOU STILL DON'T GET IT.

01:16:20.777 --> 01:16:23.546
SAMUEL L. JACKSON,
SANDRA BULLOCK,
CAMERON DIAZ,

01:16:23.613 --> 01:16:26.015
CALISTA FLOCKHART,
MADONNA AND HALLE BERRY.

01:16:26.082 --> 01:16:30.319
NOT TO MENTION FRANKLIN D.
ROOSEVELT, RONALD REAGAN,
GEORGE W. BUSH

01:16:30.386 --> 01:16:33.156
AND THE GOVERNOR
OF OUR FAIR STATE,
RICK PERRY.

01:16:33.222 --> 01:16:34.490
ALL CHEERLEADERS.
YEAH.

01:16:34.557 --> 01:16:36.525
SEE, YOU'RE
A NEGATIVE PERSON,
SHARP.

01:16:36.592 --> 01:16:38.762
CHEERLEADING IS ALL
ABOUT THE POSITIVE.

01:16:38.828 --> 01:16:42.966
OUR JOB IS TO INSPIRE,
SUPPORT AND ELECTRIFY.

01:16:43.032 --> 01:16:44.768
ANY FOOL CAN FEEL GOOD
WHEN YOU'RE WINNING.

01:16:44.834 --> 01:16:47.203
BUT WHEN YOU'RE DOWN
27 POINTS
IN THE 4TH QUARTER

01:16:47.270 --> 01:16:49.806
THAT'S WHEN YOU
GOTTA ASK YOURSELF,
"WHO YOU GONNA CALL?"

01:16:54.878 --> 01:16:56.880
I MIGHT CALL HALLE BERRY.

01:16:56.946 --> 01:16:58.614
(all cheering)
YEAH.

01:16:58.682 --> 01:16:59.916
(all laughing)

01:17:00.750 --> 01:17:02.485
(people chattering)

01:17:35.218 --> 01:17:36.853
(people chanting)

01:17:37.854 --> 01:17:39.122
(crowd cheering)

01:17:39.188 --> 01:17:40.656
(Binky)
HEY, LONGHORNS.

01:17:40.724 --> 01:17:43.459
ARE WE READY
TO TAKE A&M TO THE MAT?

01:17:43.526 --> 01:17:46.162
(crowd agreeing)

01:17:46.229 --> 01:17:48.464
I DON'T THINK THESE GUYS
CAN HEAR YOU.

01:17:48.531 --> 01:17:51.034
(crowd cheering)

01:17:51.100 --> 01:17:54.771
ALL RIGHT, WELL, NOW THAT
WE'VE PUT THE HEX
ON THOSE AGGIES,

01:17:54.838 --> 01:17:57.106
I WANT Y'ALL TO RAISE
YOUR FLAMES UP HIGH

01:17:57.173 --> 01:17:59.709
FOR SOMEONE WHO KNOWS
A THING OR 2 ABOUT SPIRIT.

01:17:59.776 --> 01:18:04.180
I AM TALKING ABOUT
ASSISTANT CHEER COACH
ROLAND SHARP.

01:18:04.748 --> 01:18:06.349
(crowd cheering)

01:18:08.617 --> 01:18:10.086
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO
WITH THIS?

01:18:10.153 --> 01:18:12.188
INSPIRE AND ELECTRIFY. GO!

01:18:14.991 --> 01:18:16.392
(Sharp)
ALL RIGHT.

01:18:16.459 --> 01:18:17.493
(woman)
BRING IT.

01:18:17.560 --> 01:18:19.228
UH,

01:18:19.295 --> 01:18:22.498
THIS TORCH RIGHT HERE
REPRESENTS

01:18:22.565 --> 01:18:25.001
THE SPIRIT BURNIN'
DEEP WITHIN THE HEART

01:18:25.068 --> 01:18:27.871
OF EACH AND EVERY LONGHORN
THAT NEVER CAN BE
EXTINGUISHED.

01:18:27.937 --> 01:18:29.305
(whooshing)

01:18:38.347 --> 01:18:40.349
ALL RIGHT.

01:18:40.416 --> 01:18:42.852
ALL RIGHT,
YOU'RE ALL HERE BECAUSE

01:18:42.919 --> 01:18:45.388
YOU WANT TO SEE
YOUR LONGHORNS
EMERGE VICTORIOUS.

01:18:45.454 --> 01:18:46.856
(crowd)
YEAH.

01:18:46.923 --> 01:18:48.992
YOU WANT TO SEE THEM
DOMINATE THE FOOTBALL FIELD

01:18:49.058 --> 01:18:50.093
(crowd cheering)

01:18:50.159 --> 01:18:52.762
AND WIN THE FOOTBALL GAME.

01:18:55.598 --> 01:18:59.202
WELL, THEN IT'S UP TO
EACH AND EVERY ONE OF US
TO HELP 'EM.

01:18:59.268 --> 01:19:00.403
WE GOT TO RAISE 'EM UP.

01:19:00.469 --> 01:19:01.670
(crowd agreeing)

01:19:01.737 --> 01:19:04.007
WE GOT TO HOIST THEM HIGH

01:19:04.073 --> 01:19:06.509
TO PUT THEM ON A PLATFORM
OF POSITIVITY.

01:19:08.244 --> 01:19:10.446
ANY FOOL CAN FEEL GOOD
WHEN YOU'RE WINNING.

01:19:10.513 --> 01:19:13.316
BUT WHEN YOU'RE DOWN
27 POINTS IN THE 4TH QUARTER,

01:19:13.382 --> 01:19:16.652
YOU GOT TO ASK YOURSELF,
"WHO YOU GONNA CALL?"

01:19:16.719 --> 01:19:18.187
I TELL YOU
WHO I'M GOING TO CALL,

01:19:18.254 --> 01:19:19.755
AND THAT'S THESE LADIES
RIGHT HERE.

01:19:19.823 --> 01:19:21.257
(crowd cheering)

01:19:21.324 --> 01:19:23.927
THEY'RE THE MOST
SPIRITED GROUP OF YOUNG LADIES
I'VE EVER SEEN

01:19:23.993 --> 01:19:26.462
OR HAD A CHANCE
TO GET TO KNOW
AND HAD THE PRIVILEGE

01:19:26.529 --> 01:19:28.197
OF COMING IN CONTACT WITH.

01:19:28.264 --> 01:19:30.900
PRAISE THE LORD
AND PASS THE AMMUNITION!

01:19:30.967 --> 01:19:32.501
(crowd roaring)

01:19:48.885 --> 01:19:52.455
(Anne)
OK, NOW CAN I GET A WITNESS?
THIS MAN HAS GOT THE SPIRIT.

01:19:52.521 --> 01:19:55.358
SWEAR TO GOD, I THOUGHT
HE WAS GONNA START SPEAKING
IN TONGUES.

01:19:55.424 --> 01:19:57.726
NO, WAIT, WAIT. WHAT ABOUT
"PLATFORM OF POSITIVITY"?

01:19:57.793 --> 01:20:00.696
I WAS GONNA DO A CARTWHEEL,
BUT DIDN'T WANT TO
STEAL THE LIMELIGHT.

01:20:00.763 --> 01:20:02.298
(girl groaning)

01:20:03.732 --> 01:20:05.268
I THINK SHARP
JUST MADE A JOKE.

01:20:05.334 --> 01:20:07.971
IT'S MORE OF A JAPE OR A JEST,
BUT STILL, IT'S PROGRESS.

01:20:08.037 --> 01:20:09.105
(Teresa)
CAN WE GO TO THE PARTY?

01:20:09.172 --> 01:20:11.474
NEGATIVO, BABY.

01:20:11.540 --> 01:20:15.778
(Teresa)
HEY, PLEASE. WHEN ARE YOU GUYS
GONNA GET OVER YOURSELVES?

01:20:15.845 --> 01:20:18.581
NOBODY, I REPEAT,
NOBODY IS TRYING TO KILL US.

01:20:24.420 --> 01:20:26.856
GET OUT OF THIS VAN,
RIGHT NOW! LET'S GO!

01:20:26.923 --> 01:20:28.457
COME ON.

01:20:28.524 --> 01:20:32.161
THIS THING IS NOT WORKING.
IT'S NOT WORKING! I'M STUCK.

01:20:32.228 --> 01:20:33.762
(Sharp)
LET'S GO!

01:20:33.829 --> 01:20:35.932
I'M STUCK!
I CAN'T GET OUT!
I'M STUCK!

01:20:37.466 --> 01:20:38.935
(Sharp)
GET DOWN!

01:20:39.002 --> 01:20:40.636
(girls screaming)

01:20:42.738 --> 01:20:44.407
(glass shattering)

01:20:54.483 --> 01:20:57.186
OK, MAYBE SOMEBODY
IS TRYING TO KILL US.

01:21:00.523 --> 01:21:02.758
HOW DID THEY, LIKE, FIND US?

01:21:02.825 --> 01:21:05.261
(Sharp)
THEY LOOKED FOR US.

01:21:05.328 --> 01:21:06.362
WHAT ABOUT EMMA?

01:21:06.429 --> 01:21:07.796
SHE DOESN'T KNOW
WHERE I AM.

01:21:07.863 --> 01:21:09.398
YES, SIR, SHE DOES.

01:21:09.465 --> 01:21:11.367
SHE CALLED LAST NIGHT
ON THE HOUSE PHONE.

01:21:11.434 --> 01:21:13.069
OOPS.

01:21:13.136 --> 01:21:15.304
SHE WAS RETURNING MY CALL.

01:21:15.371 --> 01:21:16.672
WAS THAT A MISTAKE?

01:21:18.507 --> 01:21:20.309
(sighing)

01:21:20.376 --> 01:21:21.978
GET THEM UPSTAIRS.

01:21:22.045 --> 01:21:24.347
COME ON, LET'S GO, NOW.
COME ON.

01:21:25.281 --> 01:21:26.782
COME ON, MOVE.

01:21:26.849 --> 01:21:27.917
(beep)

01:21:27.984 --> 01:21:29.518
(phone ringing)

01:21:31.554 --> 01:21:33.122
(cell phone ringing)

01:21:33.189 --> 01:21:34.223
HELLO?

01:21:34.290 --> 01:21:35.291
WHERE YOU AT?

01:21:35.358 --> 01:21:36.359
I'M AT HOME.

01:21:36.425 --> 01:21:38.261
WHERE'S YOUR MOTHER?

01:21:38.327 --> 01:21:40.829
DAD, I TOLD YOU.
SHE AND KEITH WENT TO CANCUN
FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS.

01:21:40.896 --> 01:21:42.798
LOOK, YOU DON'T HAVE TO
CHECK UP ON ME.

01:21:42.865 --> 01:21:44.467
YOUR FRIEND
FROM THE F.B.I. IS HERE.
HE TOLD ME EVERYTHING.

01:21:45.401 --> 01:21:46.936
LET ME TALK TO HIM.

01:21:48.437 --> 01:21:50.406
HE WANTS TO TALK TO YOU.

01:21:51.640 --> 01:21:53.742
HEY, SHARP.
HOW ARE YOUR WITNESSES DOIN'?

01:21:53.809 --> 01:21:55.011
EVERYONE SAFE?

01:21:55.078 --> 01:21:56.412
YOU'RE MAKING A BIG MISTAKE.

01:21:56.479 --> 01:21:58.447
GOOD, GOOD. YEAH,
I WAS JUST TELLING EMMA HERE

01:21:58.514 --> 01:22:00.950
THAT A PRETTY DESPERATE GUY
OUT THERE IS TRYING
TO COVER A CRIME

01:22:01.017 --> 01:22:04.320
AND IF HE COULDN'T GET TO YOU,
HE MIGHT COME LOOKING FOR HER.

01:22:04.387 --> 01:22:05.454
DON'T WORRY.

01:22:05.521 --> 01:22:06.855
I'M HERE NOW,
AND EVERYTHING'S COOL.

01:22:09.325 --> 01:22:10.994
EMMA DOLL,
IS THERE ANY MORE COFFEE?

01:22:11.060 --> 01:22:12.161
YES, SURE, MR. ZANE.

01:22:12.228 --> 01:22:13.829
(Zane)
THANK YOU.

01:22:18.901 --> 01:22:20.669
I'M A DEAD MAN, SHARP.

01:22:20.736 --> 01:22:22.571
I DON'T CARE
ABOUT YOUR WITNESSES ANYMORE.

01:22:22.638 --> 01:22:26.242
ALL I WANT IS THE MONEY
BALL STOLE FROM CORTLAND.

01:22:26.309 --> 01:22:30.246
ALL RIGHT,
THE NIGHT YOU ARRESTED BALL,
YOU TOOK A KEY FROM HIM.

01:22:30.313 --> 01:22:31.580
YEAH.

01:22:31.647 --> 01:22:33.882
GOOD.
HERE'S WHAT YOU'RE GONNA DO.

01:22:33.949 --> 01:22:37.020
YOU GO TO THE BANK,
TAKE THE MONEY OUT
OF THE SAFE DEPOSIT BOX,

01:22:37.086 --> 01:22:39.288
PUT THE MONEY
IN A DUFFLE BAG,

01:22:39.355 --> 01:22:40.856
GET IN YOUR TRUCK

01:22:40.923 --> 01:22:44.527
AND MEET ME IN EAGLE PASS
NEAR THE BORDER AT 2:00 P.M.

01:22:44.593 --> 01:22:47.130
ONLY YOU, SHARP. NO ONE ELSE.

01:23:04.480 --> 01:23:07.383
(man chattering in Spanish
over P.A. system)

01:23:15.324 --> 01:23:17.093
(cell phone ringing)

01:23:19.162 --> 01:23:21.164
(Zane)
PUT YOUR KEYS IN THE BAG

01:23:21.230 --> 01:23:22.931
AND GET OUT OF THE TRUCK
WITH THE MONEY.

01:23:33.576 --> 01:23:34.643
BAG ON THE GROUND.

01:23:36.679 --> 01:23:37.880
PUT YOUR WEAPON IN THE BAG.

01:23:41.617 --> 01:23:43.552
PUT YOUR CELL PHONE
IN THE BAG,

01:23:43.619 --> 01:23:45.054
GET BACK IN THE TRUCK,

01:23:45.121 --> 01:23:47.690
AND HANDCUFF YOURSELF
TO THE STEERING WHEEL.

01:23:47.756 --> 01:23:51.727
DON'T TRY ANY TRICKS, SHARP.
I WILL SHOOT HER
RIGHT HERE AND NOW.

01:24:00.002 --> 01:24:01.337
(clinking)

01:24:08.611 --> 01:24:09.845
(clicking)

01:24:09.912 --> 01:24:12.181
(man chattering
over P.A. system)

01:24:24.160 --> 01:24:26.129
THANKS, ROLAND.
YOU'RE A GOOD PARENT.

01:24:26.195 --> 01:24:29.798
(man over P.A. system)
PLEASE BOARD IMMEDIATELY.

01:24:29.865 --> 01:24:31.900
THIS IS THE LAST ANNOUNCEMENT

01:24:31.967 --> 01:24:35.971
FOR THE BUS LEAVING
FOR LAREDO, NUEVO LAREDO...

01:24:39.308 --> 01:24:40.676
(inaudible)

01:24:42.145 --> 01:24:43.646
WHAT THE HELL?

01:24:44.413 --> 01:24:46.014
(engine revving)

01:24:48.217 --> 01:24:49.752
(Sharp)
WHAT ARE Y'ALL
DOING HERE?

01:24:49.818 --> 01:24:50.919
BARB'S GOT A PLAN.

01:24:50.986 --> 01:24:52.588
BARB HAS A PLAN?

01:24:53.889 --> 01:24:55.358
YOU KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE DOING?

01:24:55.424 --> 01:24:57.860
I SPENT A YEAR
IN JUVENILE DETENTION
FOR STEALING CARS.

01:24:57.926 --> 01:25:00.263
IT WAS
AN EDUCATIONAL EXPERIENCE.

01:25:07.503 --> 01:25:09.037
HOW'D Y'ALL GET HERE?

01:25:09.104 --> 01:25:10.606
BRAND-NEW CAR.

01:25:25.288 --> 01:25:27.022
(people chattering)

01:25:45.774 --> 01:25:47.610
(breathing hard)

01:25:47.676 --> 01:25:49.645
(mimicking
woman in labor)

01:25:49.712 --> 01:25:51.013
(breathing hard)

01:25:51.079 --> 01:25:52.147
(groans)

01:25:52.215 --> 01:25:54.950
I THINK I'M HAVING
THE BABY.

01:25:56.719 --> 01:25:58.521
(muffled chattering)

01:25:58.587 --> 01:26:00.122
I CAN'T.

01:26:00.189 --> 01:26:01.690
EVIE, GET IT TOGETHER.

01:26:01.757 --> 01:26:03.626
I KNOW YOU CAN DO IT.
JUST BREATHE.

01:26:03.692 --> 01:26:05.594
COME ON. BREATHE.
READY?

01:26:11.434 --> 01:26:13.101
DRIVER, STOP THE BUS!

01:26:13.168 --> 01:26:14.403
MY FRIEND'S HAVING A BABY!

01:26:22.211 --> 01:26:23.479
I DID IT!

01:26:26.482 --> 01:26:27.850
(tires squealing)

01:26:29.652 --> 01:26:31.687
(yelling in Spanish)

01:26:31.754 --> 01:26:34.022
I HAVE TO GET OFF
EL AUTOBUS!

01:26:34.089 --> 01:26:36.859
I HAVE TO HAVE
MY BABY IN AMERICA!

01:26:36.925 --> 01:26:38.594
I'VE GOT THE BAGS.

01:26:40.663 --> 01:26:42.030
(screaming)

01:26:42.097 --> 01:26:44.267
(speaking Spanish)

01:26:44.333 --> 01:26:46.735
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA,
THAT'S MY BAG.

01:26:47.603 --> 01:26:48.871
UH, NO, NO,
IT'S MINE.

01:26:48.937 --> 01:26:50.806
(Zane)
IT'S MY BAG.

01:26:50.873 --> 01:26:51.974
(squeaking)

01:26:52.040 --> 01:26:54.142
(clanking)

01:26:54.209 --> 01:26:57.646
HI, EMMA.
WE'RE FRIENDS OF YOUR DAD'S,
SO JUST FOLLOW ME, OK?
