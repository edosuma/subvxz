00:02.377 --> 00:03.921
Previously on Gilmore Girls.

00:04.003 --> 00:06.840
- My God, I'm going to Chilton?
- You did it, babe. You got in.

00:06.924 --> 00:08.217
This guy asked about you today.

00:08.300 --> 00:09.509
- I'm Dean.
- Hi.

00:09.593 --> 00:11.803
- What did he want to know?
- Where you were.

00:11.845 --> 00:14.348
- What did you say?
- You had to go to the genius school.

00:14.431 --> 00:15.515
I've been watching you.

00:15.599 --> 00:16.683
When?

00:16.767 --> 00:17.893
Every day.

00:18.018 --> 00:20.479
- I'm Max Medina.
- Nice to meet you.

00:21.939 --> 00:23.148
I'm gonna miss the test!

00:23.190 --> 00:24.775
- Go!
- I'm gone!

00:25.400 --> 00:27.653
- What about the test?
- You've missed the test.

00:27.694 --> 00:28.737
I'm ready for it.

00:28.820 --> 00:30.572
I know everything about Shakespeare.

00:30.656 --> 00:33.325
I think there's been a terrible mistake.

00:33.825 --> 00:36.870
Rory told me that
she wasn't allowed to take her test.

00:36.954 --> 00:37.955
She was late.

00:38.038 --> 00:40.499
You say she's smart and she'll do fine.

00:40.540 --> 00:43.502
And this rotting, stodgy rathole
could use somebody like her.

00:43.543 --> 00:46.171
Then you shut her out of a test
that she's crammed for...

00:46.255 --> 00:48.548
that she completely deserves to take!

00:48.632 --> 00:50.592
No. Harvard is my dream.

00:50.926 --> 00:52.928
I want it more than anything. I swear.

00:53.011 --> 00:54.888
I'm not ready to give up on Chilton yet.

00:55.222 --> 00:56.682
It's Max Medina calling.

00:56.723 --> 00:59.518
Lorelai, it was a pleasure
encountering you.

00:59.601 --> 01:01.228
I hope it happens again.

01:01.478 --> 01:02.479
Bye.

01:03.689 --> 01:05.399
Where did you say Dad was?

01:05.482 --> 01:08.276
- Away on business.
- Location's top-secret?

01:08.902 --> 01:10.153
Germany.

01:10.278 --> 01:13.490
- Is Dad's firm insuring Nazis?
- Your father doesn't know any Nazis.

01:13.573 --> 01:15.993
- I know, Mom. I was just...
- What?

01:16.076 --> 01:18.787
Joking. She was joking.

01:19.955 --> 01:21.707
- Hard to tell.
- Yeah.

01:23.542 --> 01:26.420
I'm afraid I have some bad news.
Claudia died.

01:26.503 --> 01:28.922
- Who?
- Claudia, your cousin.

01:31.049 --> 01:33.760
I'm hearing the name, Mom.
I have no idea who that is.

01:33.844 --> 01:36.555
Claudia's your cousin,
for all intents and purposes.

01:36.638 --> 01:37.889
Now we're getting to it.

01:37.931 --> 01:40.225
She was your father's grandmother's
sister's girl.

01:40.267 --> 01:42.519
- So, to you, that would make her...
- Nothing?

01:42.602 --> 01:45.981
Regardless. Funeral's on Thursday.
I thought we'd all go together.

01:46.064 --> 01:49.234
Two problems: One, impossible
to get away from the Inn on Thursday.

01:49.317 --> 01:50.819
Two, I've never met this woman.

01:50.902 --> 01:52.487
- You certainly have.
- When?

01:52.571 --> 01:54.156
- Several times.
- I'll take one.

01:54.239 --> 01:57.075
We went to her house in Groton
to see the first moon landing.

01:57.117 --> 01:58.702
She'd just gotten a new Philco.

01:58.785 --> 02:00.620
I have no memory of this whatsoever.

02:00.704 --> 02:03.790
Rory, correct me if I'm wrong,
but men have walked on the moon...

02:03.874 --> 02:05.876
regardless of whether
your mother remembers.

02:05.959 --> 02:07.043
That's the rumor.

02:07.127 --> 02:10.172
I know men have walked on the moon.
I just don't know Claudia.

02:10.255 --> 02:12.132
- So you're not going?
- Not this time.

02:12.215 --> 02:14.885
I don't think Claudia's planning to die
a second time.

02:14.968 --> 02:17.763
- Mom, I couldn't go if I wanted to.
- Fine.

02:20.599 --> 02:23.351
Wait, Rudolph Gottfried.

02:23.518 --> 02:25.020
Another cousin?

02:25.103 --> 02:28.690
No, a Nazi that we knew. I'd forgotten.
We stayed with him once in Munich.

02:28.774 --> 02:30.609
Nice old man. Interesting stories.

02:30.692 --> 02:34.112
Mom, you socialized with a known Nazi?

02:34.196 --> 02:36.198
That's despicable. That's heinous.

02:36.281 --> 02:38.366
No, dear, that was a joke.

02:40.000 --> 02:46.074
-= www.OpenSubtitles.org =-

03:45.225 --> 03:47.852
I have an idea for a new reality show.

03:47.936 --> 03:51.439
How about everyone just looks out
their kitchen window for a change?

03:51.523 --> 03:52.941
She's cranky this morning.

03:53.024 --> 03:56.194
Let's just say the world's
got a formidable opponent.

03:56.278 --> 03:59.823
- Wait. Shouldn't you be baking?
- I don't know. Shouldn't you be knitting?

03:59.906 --> 04:03.159
- Mom, the Chilton bake sale is today.
- I know. I got it covered.

04:03.201 --> 04:05.328
- They expect things to be homemade...
- I know.

04:05.370 --> 04:07.122
...by someone other than Dolly Madison.

04:07.205 --> 04:09.165
I said I have it covered.

04:10.375 --> 04:14.170
All of the parents pitch in, so this
is really important. You know that, right?

04:14.212 --> 04:16.839
I didn't know that.
In that case, I don't have it covered.

04:16.923 --> 04:18.466
I have it covered.

04:18.550 --> 04:22.178
- Get your stuff, hit the stereo. We're late.
- That's not me.

04:25.390 --> 04:27.851
Where does your mom think you are?

04:28.977 --> 04:32.397
On a park bench, contemplating
the reunification of the two Koreas.

04:32.480 --> 04:34.190
Not here, skanking to Rancid?

04:34.232 --> 04:36.484
- Wouldn't be included.
- School.

04:39.237 --> 04:40.864
Bye.

04:43.199 --> 04:45.326
Wow, Cinnamon, riding in style.

04:45.410 --> 04:47.370
Yeah, Morey made it.

04:47.454 --> 04:52.125
Cinnamon's not walking good these days,
but she still likes her passeggiatas.

04:52.459 --> 04:55.879
- That's Italian for "a nice walk."
- Passeggiata.

04:55.920 --> 04:59.424
- Oh, God, he makes it sound so sexy.
- Come on.

04:59.507 --> 05:00.717
What's that?

05:00.759 --> 05:04.721
That's Cinnamon's private area.
Sometimes she likes to be alone.

05:04.846 --> 05:07.390
She's just like Morey in that sense.

05:08.141 --> 05:10.101
Say "passeggiata" again.

05:10.435 --> 05:12.562
I can't do it on command, Babs.

05:12.729 --> 05:16.608
He's blushing.
God, I love a man that blushes.

05:17.942 --> 05:21.196
- Okay, our town is just weird.
- Thank God.

05:21.905 --> 05:22.947
Bye.

05:23.239 --> 05:25.241
- I'll see you later at school.
- For what?

05:25.325 --> 05:26.618
Mom, the bake sale.

05:26.701 --> 05:29.412
- I got the vein in the forehead.
- Sadist.

06:04.531 --> 06:06.824
- Morning.
- Good book?

06:07.116 --> 06:08.618
I don't know yet.

06:08.701 --> 06:12.163
I saw you standing in line,
so I thought I'd say hello.

06:12.956 --> 06:14.457
- Hello?
- Hello.

06:16.626 --> 06:19.045
Thanks for helping me
get the job at the store.

06:19.128 --> 06:21.631
It's not a career or anything,
but it's got me solvent.

06:21.714 --> 06:24.133
- Solvent is good.
- Yeah.

06:24.509 --> 06:26.928
- Are you always this serious?
- No.

06:27.804 --> 06:30.848
So, how long does it take you
to get to school?

06:31.558 --> 06:33.685
Forty minutes if the bus driver's focused...

06:33.768 --> 06:37.188
but longer if he's trying to win something
on the radio.

06:37.230 --> 06:39.816
- This bus is going to Hartford.
- Yeah, I know.

06:39.857 --> 06:43.194
But you go to school here.
You have to get off the bus.

06:43.278 --> 06:45.697
- He has to get off the bus.
- Wait.

06:46.197 --> 06:48.324
You're forgetting something.

06:48.449 --> 06:50.076
Buses make stops.

06:51.369 --> 06:53.371
Goodbye, Lorelai Gilmore.

07:05.216 --> 07:07.760
Independence Inn, Michel speaking.

07:09.178 --> 07:11.055
Yes, you are confirmed.

07:12.348 --> 07:13.516
Goodbye.

07:16.561 --> 07:17.854
No, sorry.

07:20.189 --> 07:22.275
Sir, I'm a simple country boy from Texas.

07:22.358 --> 07:25.945
I do not understand this Francais business
you're babbling about.

07:26.029 --> 07:27.196
Pardon.

07:29.866 --> 07:33.453
- He knows you are not from Texas.
- Smile when you say that.

07:33.536 --> 07:36.831
Michel, I told you there would
be a French group here for some days...

07:36.914 --> 07:38.541
and it's your job to keep them happy.

07:38.583 --> 07:41.627
I don't know how many French people
you've met over the years...

07:41.711 --> 07:44.589
- but most of them are insufferable.
- Really?

07:44.922 --> 07:46.924
That is why I left France.

07:47.717 --> 07:51.220
I thought it had something to do
with the torches and the villagers.

07:51.262 --> 07:53.473
- Michel, talk to them.
- Never.

07:54.849 --> 07:57.143
You are giving me that look, aren't you?

07:57.226 --> 08:01.439
Your patented "do it or something
unspeakable shall befall you" look.

08:02.815 --> 08:06.027
Fine. I shall be French,
but I shall not be happy.

08:06.110 --> 08:08.780
Then you will be yourself. Good choice.

08:25.129 --> 08:26.255
Kill me now.

08:38.392 --> 08:41.102
Okay, we've got our French fantasies...

08:41.770 --> 08:46.359
American treats,
and our Italian taste sensations.

08:49.070 --> 08:51.030
- What do you think?
- Amazing.

08:51.113 --> 08:52.490
Incredible.

08:52.824 --> 08:55.952
It is good, isn't it? Well, final touch.

08:58.120 --> 08:59.580
Can I do that?

09:00.873 --> 09:04.627
Honey, this is a more delicate procedure
than you might think.

09:04.710 --> 09:07.004
- Okay.
- It takes an expert hand.

09:15.179 --> 09:16.180
Hi.

09:17.265 --> 09:20.393
What is that, $1? Let me just give you...

09:20.726 --> 09:22.728
Let me find you $1.

09:23.104 --> 09:26.023
You know what? I'll take two.
I'll drink one.

09:28.276 --> 09:30.319
Tasty and flame-retardant.

09:37.868 --> 09:40.663
- Very Henry Vlll.
- We're not into subtle.

09:41.122 --> 09:43.833
- Good to see you, Lorelai.
- Good to see you, Mr. Medina.

09:43.916 --> 09:45.376
- Max.
- Mr. Medina.

09:45.710 --> 09:47.920
Mr. Medina, meet Sookie,
the chef at the Inn.

09:48.004 --> 09:50.006
- Sookie, Mr. Medina.
- What's the name again?

09:50.047 --> 09:52.842
- Mr. Medina.
- I know, you've said it a zillion times.

09:52.883 --> 09:54.051
Hello.

09:54.552 --> 09:57.346
Lorelai, can I borrow you for a second?

09:57.555 --> 09:58.889
Yeah, sure.

10:02.101 --> 10:03.811
I'll be right back.

10:05.229 --> 10:06.480
Trust me.

10:08.774 --> 10:10.067
So?

10:10.359 --> 10:13.070
You know, Lorelai,
I would love for the ice to thaw.

10:13.154 --> 10:15.865
- There's no ice.
- You repeated my full name four times.

10:15.948 --> 10:17.992
- That's ice.
- That's not ice. It's wintry.

10:18.075 --> 10:20.745
I was doing my job
when I didn't let Rory take that test.

10:20.828 --> 10:23.039
- I didn't like it, but I had to do it.
- I know.

10:23.122 --> 10:24.832
- And I'd do it again.
- Okay.

10:24.915 --> 10:26.876
I really do think Rory's a great kid...

10:26.917 --> 10:30.546
and I'll do my damnedest to make sure
she gets through Chilton in one piece.

10:30.629 --> 10:32.298
I appreciate that.

10:32.381 --> 10:35.926
- And I'd like us to be friends.
- We are. Me, too.

10:36.385 --> 10:40.264
- Yeah?
- Really, truly, I swear. There's no more ice.

10:40.306 --> 10:43.017
We're walking in a pool of tepid water.

10:43.768 --> 10:44.894
Good.

10:46.437 --> 10:50.274
I'm going to propose something here.
I'm not sure how you're gonna take it.

10:50.358 --> 10:51.859
Wow, intrigue.

10:52.276 --> 10:54.487
I'd like to see you sometime.

10:55.029 --> 10:58.741
Away from the ivy,
away from the gargoyles, away from here.

10:59.450 --> 11:03.079
- Are you asking me out on a date?
- Yes.

11:03.829 --> 11:06.123
Well, I don't want to
go out on a limb here...

11:06.207 --> 11:09.794
but if the headmaster won't let
a kid be 30 seconds late for a test...

11:09.877 --> 11:12.630
he'd probably frown on
a teacher dating a mom.

11:12.713 --> 11:15.007
I do my job well,
I'm dedicated to my students...

11:15.091 --> 11:18.427
and there's nothing in
the Chilton Book of Ethics that prohibits it.

11:18.469 --> 11:20.596
But I'm guessing
it's sort of an unwritten rule.

11:20.679 --> 11:23.516
- Do you want to go?
- Rory would probably freak at the thought.

11:23.599 --> 11:25.976
Other parents would have a field day
with this thing.

11:26.060 --> 11:27.853
- Do you want to go?
- Yes.

11:27.937 --> 11:28.896
- Good.
- Wait.

11:28.979 --> 11:29.980
- What?
- No.

11:30.064 --> 11:31.232
- Why?
- I can't.

11:31.315 --> 11:32.858
- It's wrong. It's weird.
- I'll pay.

11:32.942 --> 11:34.568
- You're on.
- Really?

11:35.402 --> 11:37.947
I'm kidding. I don't know.
You're Rory's teacher.

11:37.988 --> 11:39.156
I know.

11:39.448 --> 11:42.493
Could you quit?
Right, that's crazy. I'm sorry.

11:42.993 --> 11:44.120
Okay.

11:44.912 --> 11:47.331
How about coffee? You like coffee?

11:47.998 --> 11:49.792
Only with my oxygen.

11:49.875 --> 11:53.128
Can we drink some together?
A sort of pre-date.

11:53.587 --> 11:56.507
Very casual, no strings, no obligations.

11:56.590 --> 12:01.011
We'll see if it's worth going down the road
of including food in the deal.

12:02.471 --> 12:03.848
Just coffee.

12:05.808 --> 12:06.976
Decaf?

12:08.561 --> 12:10.980
There's nothing safer than decaf.

12:13.357 --> 12:16.944
I'm gonna be in town tomorrow
because I take a class at Hartford State...

12:17.027 --> 12:19.321
and there's a coffee shop
across the street...

12:19.405 --> 12:22.992
that I sometimes, almost all the time,
go to around 4:00...

12:23.075 --> 12:24.827
and usually exactly 4:12.

12:24.910 --> 12:29.498
I could not stop a person from entering
said establishment around that time...

12:29.540 --> 12:31.750
nor would I avoid them...

12:32.209 --> 12:34.837
if I knew them, if they did.

12:36.213 --> 12:39.633
You know, the wordsmith thing,
that's something we have in common.

12:39.717 --> 12:42.344
So, see you around, Max.

12:43.137 --> 12:44.763
Indeed. You will.

12:54.565 --> 12:56.025
Philadelphia.

12:56.400 --> 12:59.528
Philadelphia? If you could live
in any city in the world...

12:59.612 --> 13:00.821
you'd pick Philadelphia?

13:00.904 --> 13:03.490
- M. Night Shyamalan lives there.
- Who?

13:03.824 --> 13:06.327
The guy who directed The Sixth Sense.

13:06.994 --> 13:08.871
But what would you do there?

13:08.954 --> 13:11.373
Hang out with M. Night Shyamalan.

13:11.874 --> 13:15.502
Okay, cross "Guidance Counselor"
off your list of potential career choices.

13:15.586 --> 13:18.339
Lie still, baby doll. We're almost home.

13:18.589 --> 13:20.591
- Hey, Babbette.
- Hey, kids.

13:22.885 --> 13:24.845
Wow, that sounds bad.

13:24.928 --> 13:27.640
Cinnamon's dyspeptic. So is Morey.

13:28.223 --> 13:30.142
- Too many clams.
- Bad clams.

13:30.225 --> 13:32.686
This doesn't reflect well
on Al's establishment.

13:32.770 --> 13:35.522
- You had clams at Al's?
- Al's Pancake World?

13:35.564 --> 13:37.399
Yeah, we had a coupon.

13:44.323 --> 13:46.367
Wow, the store.

13:46.950 --> 13:50.621
- Listen, I have to pick up some stuff, so...
- What do you have to pick up?

13:50.704 --> 13:52.664
Just some stuff.

13:53.207 --> 13:55.459
So, I'll talk to you later tonight.

13:55.542 --> 13:57.544
- I'll go in with you.
- Why?

13:57.586 --> 13:59.797
Because, otherwise, I'd have to go home.

13:59.880 --> 14:01.840
- Home is good.
- My home?

14:02.716 --> 14:04.385
Actually, I don't have to go in.

14:04.468 --> 14:06.929
Okay, then I guess I will go home.

14:06.970 --> 14:09.014
Great. Go. Bye.

14:09.098 --> 14:10.933
Bye. Freak.

14:37.126 --> 14:40.003
Rory! Hello.

14:40.295 --> 14:43.632
- Try a plum. They're better than sex.
- No, thanks.

14:43.966 --> 14:48.595
Fresh fruit always has
such a sensuality about it.

14:49.555 --> 14:52.099
- Are you too young for this?
- Definitely.

14:52.182 --> 14:55.352
- What are you here for, honey?
- Well, I just...

14:56.270 --> 14:58.397
I see what you're here for.

14:58.981 --> 15:02.901
That wouldn't fit in a basket. No.

15:02.985 --> 15:05.988
Patty, it's not like that. He's just a person.

15:06.071 --> 15:08.198
- A person?
- A boy-type person.

15:08.282 --> 15:11.201
- My favorite kind.
- I really don't even know him.

15:11.285 --> 15:13.787
- Right. You don't know him?
- I don't.

15:13.871 --> 15:16.081
- You said.
- Please don't say anything.

15:16.164 --> 15:19.293
I promise I won't tell a soul
that you don't know that young man.

15:19.334 --> 15:21.461
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

15:24.464 --> 15:25.924
Ma'am, what are you doing?

15:26.008 --> 15:29.678
Please, honey, don't call me ma'am.
It makes me feel older than 25.

15:29.761 --> 15:31.555
Here, have a pea pod.

15:31.805 --> 15:36.059
I'm assuming you'll pay for the food
that you've consumed on the premises.

15:36.351 --> 15:37.686
So brusque.

15:37.978 --> 15:41.148
- And you are?
- I'm the new assistant manager here.

15:41.315 --> 15:44.568
Listen here, my fine friend,
who, if he had a better hairstyle...

15:44.651 --> 15:47.738
I might consider dating.
I do this all the time.

15:47.863 --> 15:49.698
Not from now on. I'm sorry.

15:49.907 --> 15:53.869
Wait a minute. I've been sampling food
at this establishment for years.

15:53.911 --> 15:56.830
If you put something in that mouth
that doesn't belong there...

15:56.872 --> 15:59.249
I'll remove it and then call the police.

16:04.296 --> 16:06.840
Is this all you want?
A head of lettuce and a mousetrap?

16:06.923 --> 16:10.385
- That should do it.
- That's a couple of must-need items there.

16:12.721 --> 16:14.723
- $2.27.
- I only have $1.

16:15.057 --> 16:19.019
- I can loan you the rest.
- No, I'll just take the lettuce.

16:19.978 --> 16:22.522
Perfect. You could use half of it
for a salad...

16:22.606 --> 16:25.067
then use the other half
to clobber the mouse with.

16:25.150 --> 16:27.277
- Paper or plastic?
- I'm fine.

16:50.467 --> 16:53.720
- Lorelai?
- Max. Hi.

16:53.929 --> 16:55.931
- Small world?
- Absolutely.

16:55.972 --> 16:57.557
- What are you drinking?
- Coffee.

16:57.641 --> 16:58.683
Plain coffee?

16:58.767 --> 17:02.396
I wanted some cream, but that prompted
a very elaborate foam conversation.

17:02.437 --> 17:05.648
The disapproval I got when I said
I didn't want foam, just cream...

17:05.732 --> 17:08.734
rivaled the one from my dad
when I told him I wanted to teach.

17:08.777 --> 17:11.570
Wow, so it's been a tough outing for you.

17:11.821 --> 17:13.573
It's getting better.

17:13.615 --> 17:16.159
- What can I get you?
- Coffee, please.

17:19.454 --> 17:21.039
So, here we are.

17:21.415 --> 17:24.209
- Here we most certainly are.
- Running into each other.

17:24.291 --> 17:26.420
- Away from school.
- And its unique strictures.

17:26.461 --> 17:29.339
- These things do happen.
- Fate can be funny.

17:29.423 --> 17:31.383
Should we cut the cute and just get to it?

17:31.466 --> 17:33.593
- I think we should date.
- Why?

17:33.760 --> 17:37.639
- Because I think we both want to.
- I want to be in The Bangles.

17:37.722 --> 17:40.892
It doesn't mean I quit my job
and get a guitar and ruin my life...

17:40.976 --> 17:42.352
to be a Bangle. Does it?

17:42.436 --> 17:44.563
- The Bangles broke up.
- That's not the point.

17:44.646 --> 17:47.107
It's got to be part of it,
if there's no band anymore.

17:47.190 --> 17:49.526
I repeat my question.
Why should we date?

17:49.609 --> 17:51.945
Because we're clearly attracted
to each other.

17:51.987 --> 17:56.241
I'm attracted to pie.
It doesn't mean I feel the need to date pie.

17:56.408 --> 18:00.328
Okay, then,
because we are... of similar heights.

18:00.412 --> 18:02.747
Wow. Round 1 and already tapped.

18:03.206 --> 18:07.169
Look, I know that you are concerned
about the appearance of us dating.

18:07.210 --> 18:08.336
Yes, I am.

18:08.420 --> 18:10.505
I can tell you I'm the soul of discretion...

18:10.589 --> 18:13.633
when it comes to delicate relationships.

18:13.717 --> 18:15.594
Dated a lot of Chilton moms?

18:15.677 --> 18:18.346
No, I meant any relationship, work, family.

18:18.430 --> 18:21.933
So you have things to hide
in all aspects of your life. Very interesting.

18:22.017 --> 18:25.812
Do you have any hemlock back there?
Arsenic, something quick.

18:27.022 --> 18:29.149
- Do you like rap music?
- Yeah.

18:29.191 --> 18:30.358
Me, too.

18:30.650 --> 18:32.402
- Italian food?
- Yeah.

18:32.527 --> 18:33.695
Me, too.

18:33.778 --> 18:35.655
- You telling me what I want to hear?
- Yeah.

18:35.697 --> 18:36.740
I knew it.

18:36.823 --> 18:38.992
Doesn't mean it doesn't coincide
with how I feel.

18:39.075 --> 18:42.370
If you're telling what I wanna hear
then I'm not getting to know you.

18:42.412 --> 18:45.582
If I know what you want to hear,
it shows my understanding of you...

18:45.665 --> 18:48.084
far exceeds your understanding of me.

18:49.377 --> 18:51.254
Who's the one lagging?

18:52.797 --> 18:55.508
Wow. Round 1 and already tapped.

18:56.384 --> 18:59.638
Rory is my life. She's my pal.
My everything.

18:59.721 --> 19:03.141
And I would never ever do anything
that would hurt her.

19:04.559 --> 19:07.479
- But Rory is not a baby anymore.
- Don't say that.

19:07.562 --> 19:11.524
She's eight, and her favorite hobby
is making necklaces out of gum wrappers.

19:11.608 --> 19:14.277
You could try stunting her growth,
keeping her in a box...

19:14.361 --> 19:16.655
blowing cigarette smoke on her.

19:17.739 --> 19:20.367
You are so taking this out of context.

19:27.123 --> 19:29.584
When my uncle was a young man...

19:30.794 --> 19:33.546
there was this girl who lived
across the street from him...

19:33.588 --> 19:36.883
and he was completely in love with her.
But he never talked to her.

19:36.925 --> 19:41.012
He knew in his gut that this was the girl
he wanted to spend his life with.

19:41.096 --> 19:42.472
This is gonna be sad, isn't it?

19:42.555 --> 19:44.432
- Let me finish.
- It's gonna be sad.

19:44.516 --> 19:46.559
So, anyhow, my uncle watches this girl...

19:46.601 --> 19:48.728
waiting for the right moment
to approach her.

19:48.812 --> 19:52.148
- Next thing he knows, he gets drafted.
- I'm going for the Kleenex.

19:52.232 --> 19:55.402
Now, he thinks,
"This is perfect. I'll come back..."

19:55.443 --> 19:59.364
"I'll have a career, I'll have served
my country. I'll be worthy of her love."

19:59.447 --> 20:01.658
When he gets back, she's gone.

20:01.866 --> 20:04.077
Moved away. No one knew where.

20:04.786 --> 20:07.205
And he never saw that girl again.

20:07.414 --> 20:10.625
Now, my uncle, he didn't say much to me.

20:11.084 --> 20:13.586
But the one thing that he did say...

20:13.962 --> 20:17.590
was that if there's something in your gut...

20:17.799 --> 20:20.260
that you know you feel is right...

20:20.718 --> 20:23.346
you got to go after it, no matter what.

20:24.305 --> 20:25.932
What do you say?

20:37.485 --> 20:39.821
Maybe dinner...

20:40.738 --> 20:43.158
wouldn't be such a bad idea.

20:43.199 --> 20:46.369
Dinner? You mean we could sit together,
even drive together?

20:46.453 --> 20:49.122
- Just take the card.
- I might frame the card.

20:49.164 --> 20:51.791
- Just use the card.
- I definitely will.

21:00.341 --> 21:01.426
What?

21:02.844 --> 21:05.889
That story about your uncle, is that true?

21:09.058 --> 21:11.060
Goodbye, Lorelai Gilmore.

21:21.279 --> 21:22.655
Thank you.

21:23.990 --> 21:26.159
Life is a funny thing, huh?

21:26.284 --> 21:28.453
Yeah, I love that Jim Carrey.

21:28.870 --> 21:30.663
- What?
- Jim Carrey.

21:30.914 --> 21:33.833
- He's just funny.
- He is funny.

21:33.917 --> 21:37.545
But then I don't mean funny-funny.
I'm being philosophical.

21:37.837 --> 21:40.381
Very serious face. Jean Paul Sartre.

21:40.506 --> 21:42.425
I can't talk to you with that face.

21:42.508 --> 21:44.636
How do you guys get any work done?

21:45.511 --> 21:47.639
So why is life such a funny thing?

21:47.722 --> 21:51.100
- I met this amazing guy.
- Goody!

21:51.184 --> 21:53.895
There's goody stuff about it,
but there's baddy stuff, too.

21:53.978 --> 21:56.648
He teaches at Chilton. Max.
You met him at the bake sale.

21:56.689 --> 21:58.232
- He looked good.
- Yeah. Right.

21:58.316 --> 22:01.527
He's so sexy, smart, and funny,
and he likes coffee.

22:01.611 --> 22:03.655
God, he sounds perfect for you.

22:03.696 --> 22:05.031
- Did you get onions?
- No.

22:05.073 --> 22:07.283
Luke, you forgot the onions.

22:08.076 --> 22:11.079
I'm just so mixed up.
This is a real crossroads situation.

22:11.162 --> 22:14.374
It's like: To perm or not to perm.
I'm really confused.

22:14.666 --> 22:18.294
For heaven's sake!
Go ahead. I'm still listening.

22:18.378 --> 22:21.130
You were about to perm your hair.

22:21.464 --> 22:23.549
I just want to do the right thing.

22:23.633 --> 22:26.386
- I don't see what the problem is.
- There are many problems.

22:26.427 --> 22:29.389
First: I do not like to involve Rory
in my personal life.

22:29.472 --> 22:31.057
I don't want her to deal with that.

22:31.140 --> 22:33.935
I bring some guy home,
and he might not be the guy...

22:34.018 --> 22:37.814
but then she gets all attached to him,
and then all of a sudden I decide...

22:37.897 --> 22:41.234
that I don't like the way he eats,
or he hums incessantly...

22:41.275 --> 22:44.112
Or the way he smacks his lips,
or how his hair isn't his own.

22:44.195 --> 22:47.073
Then I break up with him,
and Rory is the one who gets hurt.

22:47.115 --> 22:49.409
- I totally understand.
- This guy is her teacher.

22:49.492 --> 22:52.203
I can't keep him out of her life.
She sees him every day.

22:52.245 --> 22:54.747
- Are you the open-faced turkey?
- Yep.

22:54.997 --> 22:57.834
I added a little fresh lemon
and a little cayenne pepper.

22:57.917 --> 22:59.377
You're gonna plotz!

23:00.586 --> 23:02.880
You do know
that Rory's not a baby anymore?

23:02.922 --> 23:04.173
That's what he said.

23:04.257 --> 23:07.719
Maybe I'm being too serious, right?
Maybe I should loosen the rules a bit.

23:07.802 --> 23:10.972
- Plus, it would be great to get, you know.
- What?

23:12.473 --> 23:14.767
- You know.
- No, I don't.

23:14.934 --> 23:16.227
You know.

23:16.769 --> 23:17.729
He knows.

23:17.812 --> 23:19.689
- You know?
- Yeah, I know.

23:20.022 --> 23:22.775
- Sookie!
- I was looking for your paprika.

23:22.859 --> 23:25.111
- What have I said about the counter?
- I know.

23:25.153 --> 23:27.947
How the counter is a sacred space,
my sacred space.

23:28.030 --> 23:29.866
You don't do yoga
on the Dalai Lama's mat.

23:29.949 --> 23:32.285
And you don't come
behind my counter. Period!

23:32.326 --> 23:33.870
I was trying to help!

23:33.953 --> 23:37.373
You bring her again,
I want her on a leash! I mean it.

23:37.540 --> 23:39.500
He does make a damn fine burger though.

23:39.584 --> 23:40.835
He does at that.

23:40.918 --> 23:43.588
All right. I'm just gonna keep it simple.
I'll tell Rory.

23:43.629 --> 23:46.424
If there's even an ounce of weirdness
about it, I'll cancel.

23:46.466 --> 23:48.593
- You haven't told Rory yet?
- No.

23:48.634 --> 23:50.303
- Oops.
- No, not oops.

23:50.386 --> 23:55.099
The timing hasn't been right.
This is a very delicate, fragile situation.

23:55.141 --> 23:58.311
It's like your souffles.
If you don't do it right, it's a disaster.

23:58.394 --> 24:01.105
And you have to order it 45 minutes
in advance.

24:01.272 --> 24:03.357
- My souffle.
- Right.

24:03.441 --> 24:05.651
But I wasn't speaking directly
about your souffle.

24:05.735 --> 24:07.904
I was speaking metaphorically.

24:07.987 --> 24:11.157
- So you don't like my souffles?
- How do we work together?

24:11.199 --> 24:12.492
Mom, you better come.

24:12.533 --> 24:14.368
- Honey, what's wrong?
- It's Cinnamon.

24:30.509 --> 24:33.638
- Babbette? Honey?
- Lorelai, come in.

24:36.557 --> 24:37.892
She's gone.

24:38.601 --> 24:41.354
- Cinnamon's gone.
- I'm so sorry.

24:42.146 --> 24:44.148
Is there anything I can do for you, Morey?

24:44.190 --> 24:46.943
This is life, Rory. It breaks your heart.

24:47.026 --> 24:48.694
She looked like she was sleeping.

24:48.778 --> 24:52.782
I thought she was asleep,
so I nudged her and she didn't wake.

24:52.865 --> 24:55.326
I gave her a push
and she rolled off the couch...

24:55.368 --> 24:59.205
and since I'd just waxed the floor,
she went shooting across the room.

24:59.288 --> 25:02.250
And then she knocked over the lamp
and she still didn't move.

25:02.333 --> 25:05.836
I knew it was over. Oh, God, my baby.

25:06.045 --> 25:08.214
Tell me it wasn't the...

25:08.297 --> 25:11.842
Morey, don't do this to yourself.
He thinks it was the clams.

25:11.884 --> 25:15.888
She saw me eating them, and she gave me
that, "Hey, man, what's up?" look...

25:15.972 --> 25:17.348
It wasn't the clams.

25:17.390 --> 25:21.060
Morey, in human years,
this cat was 260 years old.

25:21.227 --> 25:22.770
That's a good long life.

25:22.853 --> 25:25.398
Listen, why don't you let me take her out
to the van?

25:25.481 --> 25:28.484
- And then I'll get out of your way.
- No, stay.

25:28.693 --> 25:32.571
All of you, please stay.
Cinnamon would want you here.

25:32.655 --> 25:34.657
We'll stay as long as you want.

25:34.740 --> 25:37.868
- I'll never eat clams again.
- Me either.

25:51.716 --> 25:54.802
They said that they rolled her body
into a lamp?

25:56.262 --> 25:57.722
Did you laugh?

25:58.973 --> 26:00.558
Did you want to?

26:01.142 --> 26:03.394
- But it's sad.
- Yeah, it's sad.

26:06.063 --> 26:07.231
Hello?

26:08.107 --> 26:11.152
Hello, where is Lorelai?
I'm dropping something off.

26:11.235 --> 26:14.405
Yoo-hoo, heehaw man,
where's Lorelai Gilmore?

26:15.448 --> 26:17.950
Thank you. I could not get back to the Inn.

26:18.409 --> 26:21.454
What? You are having a party,
and I was not invited?

26:21.579 --> 26:24.081
Sweetie, it's not a party. It's a wake.

26:24.582 --> 26:27.209
- Really? Who died?
- Their cat.

26:29.503 --> 26:32.006
- You are mourning a cat?
- Yes.

26:32.673 --> 26:35.009
They lick their privates, these cats.

26:35.092 --> 26:37.136
Not the comforting chit-chat
we're looking for.

26:37.219 --> 26:39.221
Goodbye. I'll talk to you later. Thank you.

26:39.305 --> 26:43.142
Babbette, Morey,
I came as soon as I heard.

26:44.143 --> 26:48.105
- Darling, what do you need?
- A little air, honey.

26:51.901 --> 26:53.527
- What you got in the bag?
- Bricks.

26:53.611 --> 26:56.113
- Yeah, good one.
- Bless you both!

26:56.781 --> 26:58.616
Everyone's starved. Come in.

27:06.540 --> 27:08.417
Okay, how should we do this?

27:08.501 --> 27:11.212
We'll create a flow through the room
to avoid bottlenecks.

27:11.295 --> 27:13.797
People coming in the front door
will want a beverage.

27:13.839 --> 27:17.092
Put them on the first table,
then the hors d'oeuvres next to that...

27:17.176 --> 27:19.220
leaving one hand free to greet the people.

27:19.303 --> 27:21.180
Then, back there,
set up plates and cutlery.

27:21.263 --> 27:24.308
First the salads, then the meat,
then the desserts on the bench.

27:24.350 --> 27:26.393
- How's that sound?
- Dig in!

27:41.700 --> 27:45.746
- I wasn't expecting you.
- Or me you. I mean, you me.

27:46.205 --> 27:48.165
I mean, come on in, you.

27:53.629 --> 27:55.464
- Do you know him?
- No.

27:55.923 --> 27:56.924
No?

27:57.591 --> 28:00.761
He goes to my old school,
so I see him there sometimes...

28:00.886 --> 28:04.014
- but I go to Chilton now.
- Thanks for the update.

28:05.516 --> 28:07.017
You're welcome.

28:09.436 --> 28:12.231
- Do you have a second?
- No, I have gum.

28:13.232 --> 28:16.026
- No, thanks. Look...
- I have to get back.

28:17.319 --> 28:18.696
Okay, sure.

28:19.530 --> 28:21.240
I'll see you later.

28:31.083 --> 28:32.167
Mom?

28:34.837 --> 28:36.297
- Isn't that...
- No!

28:37.715 --> 28:40.384
- That's Mr. Medina.
- Tonight's Thursday.

28:40.426 --> 28:42.052
Am I in trouble?

28:42.136 --> 28:45.222
- Did the school call or something?
- No, you're great.

28:46.306 --> 28:48.267
Let me just come back in just one second.

28:48.350 --> 28:50.728
- Wait, what's going on?
- I'll tell you in a minute.

28:50.769 --> 28:53.105
- Tell me now.
- Max is here.

28:53.397 --> 28:55.733
- Max?
- Max is here to pick me up.

28:55.983 --> 28:57.776
Pick you up for...

28:59.737 --> 29:03.574
I'm gonna talk to him real quick,
and I'm gonna be right back.

29:10.289 --> 29:12.249
I was knocking, but no one answered.

29:12.291 --> 29:14.585
I know. I was at the neighbors' house.

29:14.626 --> 29:16.962
Max, I should have called you sooner, but...

29:17.046 --> 29:20.257
- You're canceling.
- I know it's totally last-minute.

29:20.424 --> 29:23.343
- I'm heartbroken.
- I completely forgot about our date.

29:23.427 --> 29:25.637
- And forgettable.
- No, you're memorable.

29:25.721 --> 29:28.557
I've been memorabling you all week.

29:28.640 --> 29:31.101
It's just, we had a little emergency.

29:31.226 --> 29:34.813
- Rory? Is Rory okay?
- Rory's fine. It's the neighbors' cat.

29:35.481 --> 29:37.983
- The neighbors'...
- Cat, she died.

29:39.401 --> 29:43.447
- She died.
- This was a very fat, very beloved cat.

29:43.906 --> 29:45.115
I see.

29:50.412 --> 29:51.789
I like you.

29:51.830 --> 29:55.501
And I don't want to force
something on you that you don't want.

29:57.503 --> 30:00.839
No. Wait.
Max, you're not forcing anything on me.

30:00.923 --> 30:02.966
I am telling the truth about the cat.

30:03.634 --> 30:06.136
Max, please don't read that much
into this.

30:06.553 --> 30:10.766
Call me, and we'll reschedule.
I promise that's what I want.

30:13.143 --> 30:14.520
Are you sure?

30:14.603 --> 30:18.982
Cross my heart and hope that no other
neighborhood pets die on that day.

30:19.858 --> 30:21.485
Okay, I'll call.

30:23.111 --> 30:24.196
Good.

30:25.072 --> 30:27.950
- I'm sorry about...
- Cinnamon.

30:43.382 --> 30:46.843
Stupid cat!
Couldn't have held on one more day?

30:50.472 --> 30:52.182
- Is that meatloaf?
- Yeah.

30:52.266 --> 30:53.475
You use ketchup?

30:53.559 --> 30:55.894
- You gonna make fun of my mother, too?
- Sorry.

30:55.978 --> 30:58.814
My Roquefort puffs
would complement that dish quite well.

30:58.897 --> 31:01.608
- It's fine on its own. Thank you.
- Right.

31:03.485 --> 31:05.529
Okay, toss some on the plate.

31:05.612 --> 31:08.490
Can I make a pretty design?
Maybe make some layers?

31:09.074 --> 31:11.159
Right. Tossing them on. Got it.

31:11.285 --> 31:13.120
Have you guys seen Rory anywhere?

31:13.203 --> 31:16.039
- Yeah, I think she headed that way.
- Okay, thanks.

31:21.420 --> 31:23.046
Excuse me, ma'am?

31:23.547 --> 31:25.674
Well, if it isn't Kirk the Jerk.

31:25.757 --> 31:29.052
I want to apologize for what happened
at the store yesterday.

31:29.136 --> 31:30.262
I'm listening.

31:30.345 --> 31:32.389
I wasn't aware you were the Miss Patty.

31:32.472 --> 31:35.225
The owner tells me
you're one of our best customers...

31:35.267 --> 31:38.103
and that you can put anything
in that mouth that you want.

31:38.186 --> 31:40.397
Those were his words.
I could have paraphrased.

31:40.480 --> 31:44.234
Stop sweating and close your pores, Kirky.
I always forgive.

31:44.318 --> 31:46.278
- Thank you.
- Once.

31:50.073 --> 31:52.701
- Babbette.
- Hello, sugar.

31:52.909 --> 31:56.038
- Can I get you something?
- No, I'm fine. I'm looking for Rory.

31:56.121 --> 31:59.124
- I think she might be in the bathroom.
- Thanks.

32:00.000 --> 32:01.918
- Can I help you with something?
- No.

32:01.960 --> 32:05.005
I thought I'd just get
some of this stuff packed away.

32:05.881 --> 32:08.884
It's like a scene from the kitty version
of Valley of the Dolls.

32:08.967 --> 32:12.262
Yeah, you never realize
how old they actually are...

32:12.471 --> 32:14.890
till you look in the medicine cabinet.

32:15.182 --> 32:17.768
These were for her heartworms.

32:18.435 --> 32:20.729
For her thyroid, her kidneys...

32:21.063 --> 32:23.482
for the rash she got from taking these...

32:23.565 --> 32:28.070
and these were for the tics she developed
from taking the stuff for the rash.

32:28.153 --> 32:31.073
And these are... These are mine.

32:32.115 --> 32:34.659
Damn. I'm gonna miss that old broad.

32:35.160 --> 32:36.328
I know.

32:36.661 --> 32:40.123
You know, I don't know
what I'm gonna do with myself now.

32:40.165 --> 32:42.209
You live to take care of your kids.

32:42.292 --> 32:45.253
I know, sweetie,
but you gave her everything you had.

32:46.004 --> 32:49.800
She was so tiny when I got her,
she could sleep in my shoe.

32:50.842 --> 32:54.638
The other day,
I came across a hat that I made for Rory.

32:54.971 --> 32:57.766
- It was like a doll hat.
- They grow up so fast.

32:57.808 --> 32:59.559
And then they take your clothes.

32:59.643 --> 33:02.270
I guess, eventually, you have to move on.

33:02.354 --> 33:04.689
Figure out what your life is gonna be...

33:04.773 --> 33:08.109
when you're not busy
taking care of somebody else.

33:11.822 --> 33:15.242
Jeez, look at this place.
Not a clean glass in sight.

33:15.784 --> 33:17.828
Let me help you with that.

33:22.541 --> 33:24.835
Here, sugar, use this.

33:24.876 --> 33:27.337
Morey sits on it when he helps me.

33:30.131 --> 33:33.134
- How does Morey get around in here?
- Just fine.

33:33.218 --> 33:36.221
He had a couple of concussions
his first year here.

33:36.304 --> 33:38.181
But he never complains.

33:38.473 --> 33:40.851
He's just the best thing.

33:41.560 --> 33:44.104
Don't know what I'd do without him.

33:48.233 --> 33:50.527
What do you mean without him?

33:50.735 --> 33:53.738
I saw on Oprah a few weeks ago...

33:53.989 --> 33:56.700
she had on couples who lost a child.

33:57.284 --> 34:00.954
Most of the marriages went belly up
for the pain of it all.

34:01.246 --> 34:02.831
Even though they loved each other.

34:02.914 --> 34:05.458
Babbette, that is not gonna happen to you.

34:05.542 --> 34:08.545
I never thought
a man would ever even want me.

34:08.628 --> 34:09.838
I know the feeling.

34:09.879 --> 34:12.591
Please, with that ass? Give me a break.

34:12.882 --> 34:15.885
I mean, want me for more than my ass.

34:16.428 --> 34:18.429
For me. The whole package.

34:18.847 --> 34:21.433
- Annoying neuroses and all.
- You'll find him.

34:21.516 --> 34:26.021
It might even be that stud
that drove out of here in that Mustang.

34:26.646 --> 34:28.440
- Did you see him?
- Yes.

34:28.523 --> 34:31.109
- What a jaw.
- Right. He's got a great jaw.

34:31.192 --> 34:34.821
- How is he in the sack?
- I haven't gone out with him yet.

34:35.030 --> 34:37.197
Will you tell me how he is when you do?

34:37.282 --> 34:39.617
I'll call you during the cigarette.

34:45.915 --> 34:47.958
That's Cinnamon's song.

35:17.447 --> 35:20.200
- I can't find Rory anywhere.
- I'm sure she's around.

35:20.283 --> 35:22.994
Max showed up for the date
I forgot about, and she saw him.

35:23.078 --> 35:24.537
- You haven't told her.
- No.

35:24.621 --> 35:26.122
- Oops.
- Stop with the oops.

35:26.206 --> 35:28.958
Okay, calm down.
It's not that big of a deal.

35:29.000 --> 35:31.795
Her teacher showed up on her porch
to take out her mother.

35:31.878 --> 35:34.255
She'll understand.
You're crazy. She knows that.

35:34.339 --> 35:37.133
- Enough of the comforting, Sookie.
- Sorry.

35:46.309 --> 35:48.061
Jeez, you scared me.

35:48.353 --> 35:51.439
Yeah, look,
I just wanted to say that I'm sorry.

35:51.856 --> 35:55.026
- For what?
- I've been kind of bugging you lately.

35:55.318 --> 35:59.948
I thought you maybe liked me,
but it's obvious that you're not interested.

35:59.989 --> 36:02.450
So I just wanted to say that I get it.

36:02.534 --> 36:05.120
And I'm not gonna bother you anymore.

36:12.001 --> 36:13.128
Wait!

36:15.755 --> 36:17.340
I am interested.

36:18.842 --> 36:20.510
- You are?
- Yes.

36:21.761 --> 36:23.137
I got to go.

36:31.729 --> 36:33.898
Finally. I've been looking
everywhere for you.

36:33.982 --> 36:36.359
- You found me.
- I have some explaining to do.

36:36.442 --> 36:39.946
So sit down in that tiny chair.
I'm gonna do it right now.

36:40.738 --> 36:43.533
That man on the porch was your teacher.

36:45.118 --> 36:47.495
Mom, I'm a little behind in school...

36:47.579 --> 36:50.874
but not so behind that I don't know
who the teacher is. So?

36:52.083 --> 36:55.253
He and I were going to
sort of hang out together.

36:55.336 --> 36:56.713
- On a date.
- No.

36:56.796 --> 37:00.133
On something that could appear
like a date to the untrained eye.

37:00.216 --> 37:02.176
- And to your daughter's eye?
- It was a date.

37:02.218 --> 37:05.555
- How long have you been dating him?
- This was gonna be the first time.

37:05.638 --> 37:08.349
When were you planning to tell me?
On your wedding?

37:08.433 --> 37:10.518
No, by the rehearsal dinner at least.

37:10.602 --> 37:13.021
- He's my teacher.
- I know.

37:14.230 --> 37:16.107
He teaches me things every day...

37:16.190 --> 37:18.443
in a small classroom
with a lot of other kids...

37:18.526 --> 37:21.112
who won't be high-fiving me
when they find this out.

37:21.195 --> 37:24.657
I know. I told him this was
one of the things I was concerned about.

37:24.741 --> 37:26.826
- And?
- And he thought we could be discreet.

37:26.909 --> 37:28.411
- Unbelievable!
- Are you mad?

37:28.494 --> 37:29.871
- Yes.
- Right.

37:29.954 --> 37:32.415
- Because I'm dating him?
- Because you lied to me.

37:32.457 --> 37:35.543
- I kept information from you.
- Information that I should have had.

37:35.627 --> 37:38.463
It would've come out eventually
like the Iran-Contra Scandal.

37:38.546 --> 37:40.590
- So you're Oliver North.
- No, I'm Fawn Hall.

37:40.673 --> 37:42.717
- Mom.
- She was much prettier.

37:43.301 --> 37:47.639
I can't believe that you didn't tell me
about this. Why wouldn't you tell me?

37:47.722 --> 37:51.225
'Cause I thought you were going to
take it bad. Thank God I was wrong.

37:51.267 --> 37:55.438
Okay. Listen, I'm sorry.
I won't date him. I promise.

37:56.022 --> 37:58.274
I'm not saying that you can't date him.

37:58.316 --> 38:00.651
It's just... This is weird.

38:01.444 --> 38:03.696
I mean, there are a million guys
in this world...

38:03.780 --> 38:05.365
and you end up with Mr. Medina.

38:05.448 --> 38:07.408
You think I don't get the weirdness factor?

38:07.492 --> 38:10.787
Believe me, the last thing I intended to do
was date your teacher.

38:10.828 --> 38:14.457
- I believe you.
- I really like him, Rory. I can't help it.

38:14.624 --> 38:17.085
It's been a long time
since I've felt like this.

38:17.126 --> 38:19.420
You can't always control
who you're attracted to.

38:19.462 --> 38:22.673
The Angelina Jolie-Billy Bob Thornton
thing really proves that.

38:22.757 --> 38:25.635
I know you don't understand this now,
but you will someday.

38:25.676 --> 38:28.846
You'll meet some great guy,
and he'll make your head all foggy...

38:28.930 --> 38:31.140
and you won't know
what to do with yourself.

38:31.182 --> 38:34.602
Sweetie, I won't keep anything
from you again. Okay? I promise.

38:34.685 --> 38:38.106
From now on, every aspect of my life
is an open book to you.

38:38.564 --> 38:40.108
- It's okay.
- Really.

38:40.149 --> 38:45.071
I'm not even gonna get dressed until
I tell you what I'm thinking of wearing.

38:45.530 --> 38:46.948
- Fair enough.
- Okay.

38:47.031 --> 38:49.325
Tomorrow, I'm thinking...

38:49.367 --> 38:53.287
the purple tiger top, the black leather
skirt, the panda-bear underwear?

38:53.704 --> 38:54.831
Good.

38:54.872 --> 38:57.583
But of course
I'm totally open to suggestions.

38:57.667 --> 38:59.669
Here's one: Get some help.

39:04.465 --> 39:08.344
- Let us know if we can do anything.
- You've done too much already.

39:10.054 --> 39:12.014
- Good night, Babbette.
- Good night, sugar.

39:12.098 --> 39:14.642
- Good night, Morey.
- Stay cool, Rory.

39:22.525 --> 39:24.068
It's getting late.

39:24.152 --> 39:26.654
Let's stay outside awhile, baby.

39:27.905 --> 39:32.076
- Look for the Big Dipper.
- Okay, I'd like that.

39:53.556 --> 39:56.684
- Hello.
- I've been trying to get you all afternoon.

39:56.976 --> 39:58.227
- Mom?
- Yes.

39:58.895 --> 40:01.397
- You already said that.
- But someone hasn't.

40:02.064 --> 40:03.024
Hello.

40:03.232 --> 40:05.443
- There we go.
- You are impossible to reach.

40:05.526 --> 40:07.320
There's no messages on the machine.

40:07.403 --> 40:08.654
I don't leave messages.

40:08.738 --> 40:12.033
If I wanted to talk to a machine,
I'd talk to my VCR. Where were you?

40:12.116 --> 40:13.659
- At a wake.
- A what?

40:13.743 --> 40:15.453
A wake. A funeral.

40:15.578 --> 40:18.372
- A funeral? Whose?
- It was for the neighbors'...

40:18.664 --> 40:19.707
cat.

40:23.085 --> 40:27.256
Hold on. I'm looking up "aneurysm" in our
medical dictionary to see if I just had one.

40:27.506 --> 40:30.051
I just wanted to be honest with you, Mom.
Silly me.

40:30.134 --> 40:32.428
- A cat?
- Yeah, it was a cat's funeral.

40:32.803 --> 40:36.057
You skipped your own cousin's funeral
for a cat funeral?

40:36.140 --> 40:39.435
Not my cousin. My father's grandmother's
sister's girl who I never...

40:39.477 --> 40:41.270
You said you can't be away from the Inn.

40:41.312 --> 40:44.523
- I couldn't at the time, but I worked it out.
- For a cat.

40:44.774 --> 40:47.234
It's late. I have a big day tomorrow, Mom.

40:47.276 --> 40:49.612
What? You're going to
a raccoon's wedding?

40:49.654 --> 40:51.947
- Good night, Mother.
- Good night.

40:55.242 --> 40:57.453
She's working
for a sedative manufacturer.

40:57.536 --> 40:59.330
Keeping that demand sky-high.

40:59.413 --> 41:00.915
You shouldn't have told her.

41:00.998 --> 41:03.751
I don't know what to tell and what to hide.

41:06.462 --> 41:10.716
So, we never did quite settle
the whole dating-your-teacher issue.

41:12.259 --> 41:14.512
I won't go out with him
if you don't want me to.

41:14.595 --> 41:16.972
You can go out with whoever you want.

41:17.014 --> 41:18.557
It's whoever we want.

41:18.641 --> 41:22.061
I'm certainly not gonna go out with him
'cause that'd be really weird.

41:22.144 --> 41:25.481
But I mean it.
I won't see him if you don't want me to.

41:26.982 --> 41:30.903
If there's anything that makes you
feel uncomfortable, big or small...

41:30.986 --> 41:33.614
- then he's out of there.
- Good to know.

41:34.198 --> 41:36.534
Because, you know,
it's not like I'm desperate.

41:36.617 --> 41:38.953
I mean, there are plenty
of other guys out there.

41:39.036 --> 41:40.287
Sure are.

41:40.788 --> 41:44.125
And it's not like
I have to ask your permission.

41:44.208 --> 41:46.710
- I mean, this is a courtesy.
- Okay.

41:51.257 --> 41:55.344
I'm gonna be up for a while
if you want to get back to me on this.

41:55.636 --> 41:57.430
I know where you are.

42:03.686 --> 42:06.063
Think you could keep him out late
on Thursday night?

42:06.147 --> 42:10.025
I have this oral exam on Friday
that I'd really love him to sleep through.

42:10.067 --> 42:11.652
I'll do my best.

42:12.305 --> 42:18.477
