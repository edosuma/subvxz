Make a wish, hon.

00:47.547 --> 00:48.547
- Yuck.

00:58.592 --> 00:59.426

than that, come on!

got, Mighty Mouse!

Oh, someone's been doing
her pushups, I can tell.

01:05.066 --> 01:06.133

01:06.167 --> 01:07.134

01:07.168 --> 01:10.137
Now, I want 50 miles an hour.

01:10.171 --> 01:11.939
You got it.

01:16.177 --> 01:18.145
Mom's got dinner on the table.

01:18.179 --> 01:20.123
- And Coach said that there'll
be college scouts there.

01:20.147 --> 01:22.682
So that's why we gotta win
to make it into the playoffs.

01:24.151 --> 01:26.921
- Well, it's great to
see such commitment,

01:28.555 --> 01:29.900
but your mother and
I, we're not sure

01:29.924 --> 01:32.126
you should be putting
softball first.

01:33.160 --> 01:34.171
- But, Dad, I'm on honor roll.

01:34.195 --> 01:35.096
- I know.

01:35.129 --> 01:36.173
You don't have
to worry about me.

01:36.197 --> 01:38.933
- You can play, but you're
getting a real degree.

01:38.966 --> 01:42.169
- I'm gonna play, and
we're gonna win, so.

02:51.839 --> 02:52.839
Now get out.

03:07.922 --> 03:09.556
Woo!

03:09.589 --> 03:10.589
We did it!

03:12.026 --> 03:13.227
- You guys were in the zone!

03:13.260 --> 03:14.962
- I know.

03:14.996 --> 03:16.831
- Amazing game, Kat,
I'm super proud.

03:20.201 --> 03:21.168
Wanna go get tacos?

03:21.202 --> 03:22.103
Hell yeah.

03:22.136 --> 03:23.170
- You got it.

03:23.204 --> 03:24.204
Great game, Coach!

03:46.659 --> 03:47.995
- I told you we were gonna win.

03:48.029 --> 03:49.096
- I didn't doubt you.

03:51.198 --> 03:53.167
You were amazing out there.

03:53.200 --> 03:55.702
- Coach said all the
scouts were very impressed.

03:55.735 --> 03:57.171
- He did?

03:57.204 --> 03:59.572
Professional softball
player and a lawyer?

04:00.875 --> 04:03.911
I don't know, Kat, I'm
not sure you can do both.

04:03.944 --> 04:06.947
- You can, technically, but you
just want me to be a lawyer.

04:08.049 --> 04:09.658
- I just want you to have
a regular source of income.

04:09.682 --> 04:10.682
That's what I want.

04:11.684 --> 04:15.156
- If I get a scholarship,
I am saving you money.

04:15.189 --> 04:16.891
You should be happy about that.

04:17.590 --> 04:21.228
- You make a very
good argument there,

04:21.262 --> 04:23.197
but it's not me
you gotta convince.

04:24.098 --> 04:25.765
It's your mother.

04:25.799 --> 04:27.168
- You always say that.

04:27.201 --> 04:29.270
- I always say it
'cause it's true.

04:29.303 --> 04:31.005
We only want the best for you.

04:32.139 --> 04:34.241
But you totally nailed it today.

04:34.275 --> 04:35.275
Thanks.

04:52.226 --> 04:53.226
- Be right back.

04:54.694 --> 04:55.734
Don't be taking off on me.

05:00.201 --> 05:02.103
Hey, you know what
you should be?

05:03.204 --> 05:04.805
A comedian.

05:04.839 --> 05:07.174
- If I left you here, what
would I eat for dinner?

05:07.208 --> 05:08.708
- Your mother's leftovers.

05:09.844 --> 05:12.313
- I ain't going
nowhere, I swear.

05:23.290 --> 05:25.359
- Hey, Juana.
- Hey.

05:25.392 --> 05:26.193
- I've come to pick up.

05:26.227 --> 05:28.429
Taco Tuesday.

05:58.359 --> 06:00.361
Get out of the
fucking car now, get out!

06:02.196 --> 06:04.198
No, Dad, Dad!

06:04.231 --> 06:05.798
Bitch, I'll fucking shoot you.

06:05.833 --> 06:06.433
Dad!

06:06.467 --> 06:07.334
Shut the fuck up.

06:07.368 --> 06:08.368
- Dad!

06:09.970 --> 06:11.172
Don't look at me!

06:11.205 --> 06:12.205
- Dad!

06:27.321 --> 06:28.422
What do you want from me?

06:28.455 --> 06:30.433
Please, I don't have any
money, I don't have anything.

06:30.457 --> 06:32.126
Money?

06:35.196 --> 06:38.332
I don't want your
money, little girl.

06:38.365 --> 06:40.201
I want your soul.

06:48.309 --> 06:50.244
It's what Father wants.

06:51.312 --> 06:54.215
To become one of
us, to become it.

06:57.784 --> 07:00.354
- Great, got the
extra salsa and guac?

07:00.387 --> 07:02.323
Show me you want it.

07:02.356 --> 07:04.024
Show me.

07:05.226 --> 07:07.361
No, no, no, no, no!

07:07.394 --> 07:09.196
No!

07:21.208 --> 07:22.243
It's done.

07:24.245 --> 07:26.013
- Kat!

07:26.046 --> 07:27.147
We gotta go, brother.

07:27.181 --> 07:28.515
- Now.
- Kat!

07:58.979 --> 08:00.147
On the ground!

08:02.082 --> 08:03.082
- Kat!

08:16.196 --> 08:17.196
Help me!

08:27.207 --> 08:29.576
William!

08:29.610 --> 08:30.610
- Jen.

08:34.148 --> 08:35.282
- What happened?

08:37.651 --> 08:39.186
- They hurt her.

08:42.589 --> 08:44.091
- Are you okay?

08:51.632 --> 08:53.233
No, no, no, no, no.

08:56.236 --> 08:58.405
No, no.

09:02.943 --> 09:04.178
No, no.

09:04.211 --> 09:06.313
Oh, please, no, no, no.

09:09.950 --> 09:13.220
- The Eatonton Journal emailed,
asking for an interview.

09:16.023 --> 09:18.192
William, did you hear me?

09:22.062 --> 09:25.099
- I have to go meet with
the prosecuting attorney.

09:25.132 --> 09:26.367
- What do they want?

09:33.407 --> 09:34.617
In the
interest of getting this thug

09:34.641 --> 09:36.977
off the streets as
soon as possible,

09:37.010 --> 09:38.355
his attorneys agreed
to plead guilty

09:38.379 --> 09:40.147
to assaulting an officer,

09:40.180 --> 09:41.224
possession with the
intent to distribute,

09:41.248 --> 09:44.151
and resisting arrest, and
that's all in addition

09:44.184 --> 09:46.153
to his parole violations.

09:46.186 --> 09:47.621
We're looking at five to seven.

09:50.391 --> 09:51.358
- Years, that's it?

09:51.392 --> 09:53.427
- If he keeps clean, he
could be out in three,

09:53.460 --> 09:55.396
but, yes, that's what
it's looking like.

09:57.197 --> 09:59.066
- This kid murdered my daughter.

10:00.300 --> 10:05.305
He should be executed or
life in jail, no parole.

10:05.672 --> 10:09.176
- Mr. Duncan, we've got
no video, no photos,

10:10.210 --> 10:12.179
no eyewitnesses except you.

10:12.212 --> 10:14.214
You got a concussion
during the struggle.

10:15.082 --> 10:17.618
You want everything
riding on an eye test,

10:17.651 --> 10:19.186
some optometrist
they put on the stand

10:19.219 --> 10:21.989
who's gonna say you were
in shock and hallucinating?

10:23.190 --> 10:24.158
- I know what I saw.

10:24.191 --> 10:26.160
- Your biggest problem
is that there's no gun.

10:26.193 --> 10:28.128
- Well, they took it.

10:28.162 --> 10:29.162
- Who's they?

10:30.364 --> 10:32.166
I'm just saying what
they're gonna say.

10:32.199 --> 10:34.101
Look, if you wanna
try to convince the DA

10:34.134 --> 10:36.170
to take this to trial,
you're welcome to.

10:36.203 --> 10:37.380
But this case is so paper thin,

10:37.404 --> 10:39.106
the judge is probably
gonna throw it out,

10:39.139 --> 10:42.176
and Danny Fetter is gonna
be back on the streets.

10:42.209 --> 10:45.078
At least this way, he's
off for a good few years.

10:45.112 --> 10:46.523
Basically, it's your
word against his.

10:46.547 --> 10:48.649
- It's bullshit is what it is.

10:48.682 --> 10:50.184
It's bullshit, and you know it!

10:50.217 --> 10:52.419
- I'm not disagreeing
with you, Mr. Duncan,

10:53.220 --> 10:55.222
but I gotta be honest,
I had to schmooze

10:55.255 --> 10:57.424
the judge to agree to
half those charges.

10:57.458 --> 11:00.427
The plea deal makes the
most sense, trust me.

11:03.263 --> 11:06.166
And that night, outside
the Mexican restaurant

11:06.200 --> 11:08.001
that you and your
daughter visited,

11:08.035 --> 11:09.646
can you point out the
attacker that you saw

11:09.670 --> 11:11.205
and physically fought with?

11:21.615 --> 11:23.016
- No.

11:23.684 --> 11:24.684
Settle.

11:25.185 --> 11:28.489
- Not sure I can
confidently identify

11:28.522 --> 11:31.425
that man as the
attacker, Your Honor.

11:32.526 --> 11:33.794
- What the fuck are you doing?

11:33.828 --> 11:37.197
- Mr. Duncan, are
you absolutely sure

11:37.231 --> 11:40.234
that you cannot confidently
point out the attacker?

11:43.770 --> 11:46.673
- Yes, Your Honor,
I'm 100% sure.

11:46.707 --> 11:49.176
- Mr. Fetter, you
are free to go.

11:49.209 --> 11:53.180
I see no reason to further
waste this court's time.

11:53.213 --> 11:56.683
Case dismissed.

12:20.507 --> 12:23.210
- I'm so fucking proud of you.

12:23.978 --> 12:26.380
You can do anything in
this life, you know that?

12:29.316 --> 12:31.184
You can do anything.

12:34.187 --> 12:35.187
I love you.

12:36.356 --> 12:37.356
Come on.

12:56.410 --> 12:57.544
- You did good.

12:59.246 --> 13:01.615
You can run this world,
the streets, everything.

13:03.617 --> 13:05.118
It can be yours.

13:05.152 --> 13:07.855
If anybody tells you
otherwise, you know what to do.

13:11.224 --> 13:12.292
You're a man now.

13:13.527 --> 13:14.527
- Thanks, Dad.

13:15.762 --> 13:16.762
- Get in the truck.

13:43.590 --> 13:44.767
Go see what that
guy wants, all right?

13:44.791 --> 13:45.592
Right.

13:45.626 --> 13:48.228
Come on now.

13:48.261 --> 13:49.396
Hurry the fuck up, bitch.

13:49.429 --> 13:50.631
- All right, whatever.

14:01.375 --> 14:03.543
You look like you could
use some fun, baby.

14:05.779 --> 14:06.779
- I'm fine, thanks.

14:09.549 --> 14:10.549
- Missing out.

14:14.788 --> 14:15.722
All right, let's
get outta here now.

14:15.756 --> 14:18.291
All right,
man, I'm coming, yeah.

14:18.325 --> 14:19.803
Don't fuck up with
that other one, too, baby.

14:19.827 --> 14:20.627
Got it.

14:20.661 --> 14:22.229
Get your ass moving, come on.

15:00.434 --> 15:02.937
Oh, motherfucker!

15:02.970 --> 15:05.807
My leg is broke.

15:08.508 --> 15:09.508
You.

15:11.278 --> 15:13.014
You're that girl's pops.

15:13.047 --> 15:14.448
- Yep.

15:16.017 --> 15:17.017
Her pops.

15:19.753 --> 15:21.254
- And you're here
to kill me, huh?

15:28.395 --> 15:29.395
What?

15:36.070 --> 15:40.007
If you do this, there's no
going back for you, asshole.

15:40.041 --> 15:41.441
- You killed my little girl.

15:44.045 --> 15:45.046
She was innocent.

15:45.079 --> 15:47.581
- Yeah, sure about
about that, huh?

21:26.854 --> 21:30.623
- A lot can happen
in five minutes.

21:30.657 --> 21:32.625
I can cut your fucking dick off

21:34.794 --> 21:36.097
in five fucking minutes,

21:36.130 --> 21:37.797
and shove it up your ass.

21:38.798 --> 21:39.798
- Sure.

21:48.342 --> 21:49.410
- What the fuck is this?

21:49.443 --> 21:51.045
- It's dead out there.

21:51.078 --> 21:53.713
- You don't think
that I know this town?

21:53.746 --> 21:55.015
Where's the rest of it?

21:56.783 --> 21:57.783
- That's it.

21:59.153 --> 22:01.122
♪ Put 'em up, put 'em up ♪

22:01.155 --> 22:02.156

- What the fuck?

22:20.341 --> 22:24.378
- I give you and your
friends full access.

22:25.712 --> 22:27.081
You disrespect me.

22:29.150 --> 22:30.384
- Whatever.

22:30.417 --> 22:31.852
- You fucking high?

22:33.420 --> 22:35.022
You're high right
now, aren't you?

22:35.055 --> 22:37.158
- Yeah, I'm the one that's high.

22:38.392 --> 22:39.792
- Fucking tweaker.

22:40.494 --> 22:44.899
You come up short like this
again, I won't be forgiving.

22:47.501 --> 22:49.170
Now get the fuck outta here.

22:51.172 --> 22:52.172

- What about my brother?

23:30.177 --> 23:31.744
Yo, yo, yo, I can't let you in.

23:31.778 --> 23:33.156
- Can't let you in.
- That's my brother.

23:33.180 --> 23:34.224
I said I need you to step back.

23:34.248 --> 23:35.216
- I just told you that
that's my little brother.

23:35.249 --> 23:37.318
- And I just told you I
need you to step back.

23:37.351 --> 23:39.053
I'm not gonna ask you again.

23:40.154 --> 23:41.154
- Who did this?

23:42.957 --> 23:44.467
- That's what we're
trying to find out.

23:44.491 --> 23:46.160
- Rory.

23:49.129 --> 23:50.130
Hey, man.

23:53.067 --> 23:54.067
Not right now.

23:55.836 --> 23:56.836
I know.

24:08.282 --> 24:10.117
Put your goddamn weapon away.

24:14.922 --> 24:16.123
- Who the hell is that guy?

24:16.957 --> 24:18.092
That's Rory Fetter.

24:18.125 --> 24:19.125
- Donnie's boy?

24:19.960 --> 24:22.363
- Yeah.

24:22.396 --> 24:27.401
Shit.

24:47.154 --> 24:48.522
- Can I help you?

24:48.555 --> 24:49.890
- Detective Neil Chen.

24:54.895 --> 24:56.297
- Are you William Duncan?
- Yeah.

24:57.898 --> 24:59.099
What's going on?

24:59.133 --> 25:00.067
- I came here to inform you

25:00.100 --> 25:01.740
that Danny Fetter was
murdered last night.

25:02.936 --> 25:03.936
- Oh.

25:06.206 --> 25:09.076
Well, how did it happen?

25:09.109 --> 25:10.109
- Not sure yet.

25:10.744 --> 25:12.913
What were you doing
last night, Mr. Duncan?

25:14.081 --> 25:15.081
- I was here.

25:15.683 --> 25:19.153
I mean, I went for a
walk, but I was here.

25:19.186 --> 25:21.155
- Yeah, he was here.

25:22.189 --> 25:23.390
- Am I a suspect, Detective?

25:24.625 --> 25:26.093
- At this point, I can't say.

25:26.126 --> 25:27.628
- I didn't kill him.

25:27.661 --> 25:29.430
- Sure, I understand
what you're saying.

25:31.398 --> 25:33.367
- You have any idea who did?

25:33.400 --> 25:37.037
- No, but all of
those Fetter boys

25:37.071 --> 25:39.440
run in some dicey circles,
so we got a few leads.

25:42.142 --> 25:46.480
- Well, I wish we could help.

25:47.648 --> 25:49.116
As you can imagine,
my wife and I

25:49.149 --> 25:52.152
are going through our
own grief right now, so.

25:52.953 --> 25:55.122
- Well, I'll let you
know if there is.

25:55.155 --> 25:56.155
Here.

25:57.157 --> 25:59.593
Give me a call if
you think of anything

25:59.626 --> 26:01.495
that might be helpful,

26:01.528 --> 26:04.531
and don't leave town without
letting me know, okay?

26:04.565 --> 26:06.633
Might have a few more questions.

26:06.667 --> 26:07.667
Sure.

26:20.080 --> 26:20.681
You okay?

26:20.714 --> 26:21.714
- Yeah.

26:26.220 --> 26:27.521
Where were you last night?

26:29.156 --> 26:30.367
- I just said, I
went for a walk.

26:30.391 --> 26:32.459
- You never just go for a walk.

26:34.161 --> 26:37.164
- Well, I've also never had
my only child murdered before.

26:38.532 --> 26:41.034
- I don't want you to
go back to how you were.

26:43.170 --> 26:44.638
- What does that mean?

26:44.671 --> 26:46.349
You mean when I had bullets
flying around my head

26:46.373 --> 26:49.009
and my best friends were
dying all around me?

26:49.042 --> 26:50.042
Is that what you meant?

26:51.178 --> 26:52.178
This is different.

26:54.615 --> 26:55.615
It's our daughter.

27:03.390 --> 27:04.390
You know what?

27:06.160 --> 27:07.995
I can't believe
you'd even say that.

27:16.770 --> 27:17.738
To Danny.

27:17.771 --> 27:18.771
Danny.

27:19.473 --> 27:20.574
Salut.

27:20.607 --> 27:22.443
He was good fucking man.

27:27.481 --> 27:29.483
- I wanna find the
person that did this.

27:32.753 --> 27:34.321
I don't just wanna
take their life.

27:34.354 --> 27:36.590
I want him to suffer
indescribably.

27:36.623 --> 27:38.392
- Don't trip, boss.

27:38.425 --> 27:39.425
We gonna find him.

27:41.195 --> 27:43.030
We gonna find him.

27:43.063 --> 27:44.063
- Will we?

27:46.366 --> 27:47.534
Where will we find him?

27:48.168 --> 27:51.138
Is he in your bottle
that you're drinking?

27:51.171 --> 27:52.439
Is he under this table?

27:53.307 --> 27:54.708
Huh, are you him?

27:55.576 --> 27:59.046
Do you plan on finding
him while you're sitting

27:59.079 --> 28:00.647
on your fat fucking
ass, drinking?

28:01.381 --> 28:03.150
- The girls was out
all night last night.

28:03.183 --> 28:04.718
Maybe they saw something.

28:04.751 --> 28:07.020
You know what I'm saying?

28:09.189 --> 28:10.189
- Ask 'em.

28:11.658 --> 28:12.658
Yeah, now.

28:14.194 --> 28:15.194
- Yeah.

28:20.167 --> 28:23.370
Yo, yo, girls, get
off the fucking pole!

28:23.403 --> 28:24.403
Come here!

28:25.372 --> 28:26.773
Hurry up, come on now!

28:28.709 --> 28:29.709
Come on.

28:30.444 --> 28:31.645
Shit.

28:35.148 --> 28:38.418
Y'all see anything strange
out here last night?

28:38.452 --> 28:39.452
Huh?

28:40.220 --> 28:41.221
- Yeah, I saw a guy.

28:43.190 --> 28:44.124
- Oh, yeah?

28:44.157 --> 28:45.425
- Yeah.

28:45.459 --> 28:46.760
Seemed kinda out of place.

28:48.095 --> 28:49.429
- Really?

28:49.463 --> 28:51.131
Come with me.

28:51.164 --> 28:52.533
Come on!

28:52.566 --> 28:53.700
Come on, shit.

28:55.502 --> 28:58.472
Tell him, tell him
what you told me.

29:10.350 --> 29:14.555
- There was this one white
guy, dressed real well,

29:14.588 --> 29:18.125
like a businessman,
just waiting in his car.

29:18.158 --> 29:22.062
I went up to him, but he
wasn't there to party.

29:23.397 --> 29:27.869
Looked kinda nervous,
actually, real intense.

29:27.902 --> 29:28.902
- Hmm.

29:31.705 --> 29:32.705
Hold that.

29:40.848 --> 29:43.350
Is that him, is that the
man you almost serviced?

29:44.418 --> 29:47.187
- That's him, definitely.

29:52.159 --> 29:54.628
William Duncan.

29:58.165 --> 29:59.199
- It's the dad.

30:00.300 --> 30:05.505
It's the father of the
little girl that Danny did.

30:11.178 --> 30:14.147
Get everyone, everyone.

30:15.582 --> 30:17.517
I want to go hunting.

30:51.218 --> 30:54.221
I spy with my little
eye a dead guy.

30:55.789 --> 30:56.789
Gotcha.

31:32.994 --> 31:33.995
Get up.

32:03.057 --> 32:05.659
That was exciting,
William Duncan.

32:06.994 --> 32:08.996
That's right, I know your name.

32:10.530 --> 32:11.966
I know everything about you.

32:15.002 --> 32:16.971
- What do you want?

32:17.004 --> 32:17.939
- What do I want?

32:17.972 --> 32:20.474
I want you to not exist anymore.

32:22.676 --> 32:23.777
I wanna watch you die.

32:25.880 --> 32:26.981
You killed my brother.

32:28.850 --> 32:29.850
I want revenge.

32:47.334 --> 32:48.970
- Please, please.

32:49.003 --> 32:51.404
Please, please, please.

33:09.991 --> 33:11.324
Hey!

33:11.358 --> 33:12.592
There's a shooter!

33:12.626 --> 33:13.794
There's a shooter!

33:14.694 --> 33:15.328
There's a shooter!

33:15.362 --> 33:16.563
There's a guy on the ground!

33:16.596 --> 33:17.664
I think he got shot!

33:24.806 --> 33:26.339
- Right there, right there.

33:35.149 --> 33:36.583
- Are you at home?

33:36.616 --> 33:38.451
Lock all the doors and windows.

33:38.485 --> 33:39.719
Just do it!

33:39.753 --> 33:41.989
I'll explain it all
when I get home.

33:51.032 --> 33:51.999
- Get back inside the house!
- What's going on?

33:52.033 --> 33:52.834
Why, what?

33:52.867 --> 33:53.867
- Inside!

34:01.741 --> 34:03.010
- What the hell is going on?

34:04.011 --> 34:05.679
- Some people tried to kill me.

34:06.746 --> 34:07.982
- What, why?

34:08.015 --> 34:09.951
Does it matter?

34:11.451 --> 34:13.120
- You need to call
that detective.

34:17.524 --> 34:18.725
Call.

34:29.536 --> 34:30.972
- Well, the prints came back.

34:31.839 --> 34:35.408
The Vic is a Jason
Ditman, aka Henley.

34:37.111 --> 34:38.645
- Henley.

34:38.678 --> 34:40.014
How do I know that name?

34:40.047 --> 34:41.648
- He's one of Rory
Fetter's boys.

34:43.583 --> 34:45.019
- What the hell is going on?

34:51.458 --> 34:52.458
This is Neil Chen.

34:53.727 --> 34:56.030
- Detective, it's
William Duncan.

34:57.965 --> 34:59.200
- William Duncan.

34:59.233 --> 35:01.168
I was just thinking about you.

35:01.202 --> 35:02.202
What's up?

35:03.104 --> 35:05.605
- I need you to
come to the house.

35:08.042 --> 35:09.643
- Yeah, I'll be right there.

35:13.647 --> 35:14.748
Excuse me.

35:14.781 --> 35:15.950
You can try to spin this,

35:15.983 --> 35:17.784
but I know you
killed Danny Fetter.

35:19.987 --> 35:21.055
I know why you did it.

35:21.989 --> 35:23.590
I honestly don't even blame you.

35:26.027 --> 35:26.994
I'm pretty sure
that it'll shake out

35:27.028 --> 35:28.148
that you killed Henley, too.

35:28.829 --> 35:31.832
That dead guy, from
like an hour ago?

35:35.236 --> 35:38.039
You can give me the silent
treatment all you want.

35:38.072 --> 35:40.207
There is no other
reason why Rory Fetter

35:40.241 --> 35:42.009
would be so gung-ho to kill you.

35:42.043 --> 35:43.677
You know damn well
you started a war.

35:43.710 --> 35:44.979
Now you want me to help you.

35:45.012 --> 35:46.047
I don't know if I can.

35:47.982 --> 35:49.050
Why should I help you?

35:51.953 --> 35:53.263
- I don't want my
wife to get hurt.

35:53.287 --> 35:54.889
- You should've thought
about that before

35:54.922 --> 35:57.024
you went and got your revenge.

35:57.058 --> 35:58.758
What'd you think
was gonna happen?

36:05.299 --> 36:09.502
Marine Corps Commendation
Medal, Iraq, Afghanistan.

36:11.172 --> 36:13.506
Looks like you know
how to handle yourself.

36:15.608 --> 36:16.944
- That was a long time ago.

36:17.945 --> 36:19.246
- This is where it's at now.

36:21.048 --> 36:23.616
You picked a hell of a
crew to start a fight with.

36:29.156 --> 36:31.826
Got a squad car
outside all night.

36:31.859 --> 36:33.626
You'll be safe.

36:33.660 --> 36:35.062
This is far from over.

36:36.696 --> 36:37.874
I'll be back tomorrow
with a lot more questions,

36:37.898 --> 36:39.934
and I want answers.

36:39.967 --> 36:41.634
You're gonna have to
start talking to me,

36:41.668 --> 36:42.769
or to a judge.

37:17.071 --> 37:20.074
- Nice wheels, goddamn!

37:20.774 --> 37:22.609
- Well, I figured you'd
pay me extra for it.

37:22.642 --> 37:24.879
- You're funny,
you're very funny.

37:24.912 --> 37:25.980
No, I'm serious.

37:26.013 --> 37:28.615
- I'm just so glad you made
it, right on time, man.

37:28.648 --> 37:32.619
The boat to Sierra Leone is
leaving in about 15 minutes.

37:32.652 --> 37:34.021
- Well, break me off, man.

37:34.055 --> 37:36.023
That thing's worth at least 20.

37:36.057 --> 37:37.992
Shit, the sticker says 70.

37:38.025 --> 37:39.960
- I get paid when
the boat leaves.

37:39.994 --> 37:42.029
I don't get paid, all right.

37:42.063 --> 37:43.030
You can still pay me, man.

37:43.064 --> 37:44.231
I know you got it.

37:44.265 --> 37:47.068
- I don't get paid til the
fucking car's in the container.

37:47.101 --> 37:48.635
- Fuck that.
- Come on.

37:48.668 --> 37:50.304
- I'm not gonna Uber
home with nothing.

37:50.337 --> 37:51.806
You know what, put
some plates on it.

37:51.839 --> 37:53.083
I'll drive this
fucking thing home.

37:53.107 --> 37:54.942
- Hey, wait a minute,
wait a minute.

37:55.608 --> 37:57.577
You're not going
home with nothing.

37:58.279 --> 38:00.147
See, you're not going
home with nothing.

38:00.181 --> 38:01.181
- What's this?

38:03.084 --> 38:05.052
What it look like?

38:05.086 --> 38:06.126
- It looks like an insult.

38:07.321 --> 38:09.323
- Oh, okay, okay.

38:14.061 --> 38:15.830
- I'll take that Mercedes.

38:15.863 --> 38:17.697
- It belongs to somebody.

38:17.730 --> 38:18.899
- So did that.

38:18.933 --> 38:20.493
I'm sure that belonged
to somebody, too.

38:23.070 --> 38:24.238
- Please, indulge.

38:30.244 --> 38:32.679
That's a lot of fucking
money on the street.

38:37.451 --> 38:38.451
- Looks Chinese.

38:40.054 --> 38:42.755
- That's a better market.
- Yeah.

38:42.789 --> 38:43.789
Fuck.

38:47.428 --> 38:48.428
You owe me, man.

38:49.964 --> 38:51.899
- I know, I know, I know.

38:51.932 --> 38:52.932
Thank you very much.

38:53.934 --> 38:55.768
You owe me!

39:20.261 --> 39:22.062
- You're drinking?

39:22.096 --> 39:23.096
- Yep.

39:24.465 --> 39:26.367
- You need to tell
me what's going on.

39:30.070 --> 39:34.208
- If you knew, you wouldn't
look at me the same way again.

39:35.342 --> 39:39.079
- William, hey, I love you.

39:41.048 --> 39:43.918
You are my husband, and
whatever's going on,

39:43.951 --> 39:45.052
we are in it together.

39:48.822 --> 39:51.292
- I feel like I'm right
back in the Middle East

39:51.325 --> 39:52.426
in a fucking war zone.

39:53.127 --> 39:55.029
- What are you talking about?

39:55.062 --> 39:57.464
- You don't wanna
know, Jen, you don't.

39:58.465 --> 40:00.034
- I do.

40:06.507 --> 40:07.507
- I killed him.

40:10.077 --> 40:12.947
I killed Danny Fetter.

40:17.952 --> 40:19.853
He took our baby away.

40:19.887 --> 40:23.490
He was gonna go away for
five to seven years, maximum.

40:24.525 --> 40:26.026
It wasn't fair.

40:26.060 --> 40:26.961
- William-
- It wasn't fair!

40:26.994 --> 40:28.462
William, I don't know what you.

40:33.467 --> 40:35.336
- And now the rest
of them want my head.

40:35.369 --> 40:36.837
- Well, do we need to leave?

40:38.072 --> 40:39.139
- Where are we gonna go?

40:39.173 --> 40:41.117
- Yeah, well, we can't
stay here if it's not safe.

40:41.141 --> 40:42.409
- There's a squad car outside.

40:42.443 --> 40:46.046
We'll be fine, but first
thing in the morning,

40:46.080 --> 40:48.082
go to your folks, at
least for tonight.

40:54.088 --> 40:55.198
- And I take it
back to the store,

40:55.222 --> 40:58.025
and I tell this moron kid
like, "Hey, broke again."

40:58.726 --> 41:01.395
And this dummy kid says I
didn't install it properly

41:01.428 --> 41:04.031
and because I, oh shit!

41:04.064 --> 41:05.299
No fucking way!

41:06.934 --> 41:09.036
That prick threw the
fucking bottle at us.

41:18.412 --> 41:19.480
- Why did they leave?

41:23.884 --> 41:25.953
Hello, hello.

41:34.295 --> 41:35.929
- Don't make that phone call.

41:36.864 --> 41:37.864
- Give me the phones.

41:39.066 --> 41:40.567
Give me the phone!

41:41.869 --> 41:42.869
Both of you.

41:43.604 --> 41:44.604
Yours.

41:46.106 --> 41:47.106
Thank you.

41:48.075 --> 41:49.910
- Can I call you Bill?

41:49.943 --> 41:50.943
William?

41:51.412 --> 41:53.047
How about Willy?

41:53.080 --> 41:55.482
- I don't know, Donnie,
whatever you prefer.

41:57.484 --> 41:58.484
- I like Willy.

41:59.386 --> 42:01.055
- Yeah.

42:01.088 --> 42:02.088
Rory.

42:04.491 --> 42:06.927
- Don't believe
everything you read.

42:06.960 --> 42:08.862
I'm a very nice guy.

42:08.896 --> 42:11.165
- Listen, this is just
between you and me.

42:12.433 --> 42:13.834
Leave my wife out of it.

42:14.902 --> 42:18.072
- Jen, go, go-
- No, no, no.

42:18.105 --> 42:23.077
- It's about quality time
with family, right, Jennifer?

42:23.544 --> 42:25.579
Or Jenny, Jen?

42:28.515 --> 42:33.253
Did you know that your
husband killed my son?

42:33.287 --> 42:36.123
- Only because your
son killed my daughter.

42:36.156 --> 42:37.624
- Well, he was my son.

42:40.027 --> 42:43.030
- Why do you look so
angry, William, huh?

42:44.498 --> 42:46.100
You're the one who
did the killing.

42:47.101 --> 42:48.235
Don't be angry.

42:48.268 --> 42:49.403
It'll all be over soon.

42:54.541 --> 42:57.544
- You got the good shit, fancy.

42:58.512 --> 43:00.214
We drink cheap shit.

43:01.115 --> 43:03.050
I like the gasoline taste.

43:04.184 --> 43:05.686
But that's just me.

43:11.091 --> 43:13.127
No, goddamn!

43:13.160 --> 43:17.631
- No, no, no, no, no, sit down.

43:17.664 --> 43:21.568
Get down, no, no, no, no,
Willy, down on your knees.

43:21.602 --> 43:22.236
She had nothing to do with it.

43:22.269 --> 43:24.471
- Beg for your fucking life.

43:24.505 --> 43:25.639
- Say hello to my son.

43:48.362 --> 43:50.397
- Do you see the light, Willy?

43:50.431 --> 43:55.436
Is it everything they
say it is, huh, huh?

43:57.104 --> 43:59.573
I can't wait to celebrate death.

44:01.542 --> 44:05.546
For now, I act as
its executioner.

44:07.047 --> 44:08.115
- Fuck you.

44:08.148 --> 44:10.451
- Mm, that's what you wanna
use as your last words?

44:12.219 --> 44:13.454
You should enjoy this.

45:14.114 --> 45:16.350
911, what's your emergency?

45:17.317 --> 45:20.053
- Hello?
- Help.

45:20.087 --> 45:20.922
- Sir?
- Help.

45:20.955 --> 45:23.090
Sir, are you all right?

45:40.140 --> 45:41.843
- Mr. Duncan, oh,
God, Mr. Duncan!

45:41.876 --> 45:43.410
You're gonna injure yourself.

45:43.443 --> 45:44.478
Here, come on.

45:44.511 --> 45:47.614
Let's get up, let's get
you back in bed, come on.

45:47.648 --> 45:51.084
Help, help, help, help,
I need some help in here!

45:51.118 --> 45:52.252
Oh, easy.

45:52.286 --> 45:54.087
- Help!
- It's okay.

45:54.121 --> 45:54.755
Calm down,

45:54.788 --> 45:56.123
- calm down.
- Why?

45:56.156 --> 45:58.225
Doctor, Doctor!

45:58.258 --> 46:01.094
It's okay, easy, easy.

46:01.128 --> 46:02.596
- Okay, help me strap him in.

46:02.629 --> 46:04.097
He's having a manic episode.

46:04.131 --> 46:05.131
Come on, sir.

46:05.833 --> 46:08.135
10 milligrams Haloperidol.

46:09.503 --> 46:11.371
- Got it!
- And get some ketamine.

46:11.405 --> 46:13.507
Breathe with me, come on, sir.

46:15.442 --> 46:17.544
It's gonna make you
feel better, calm down.

46:20.815 --> 46:22.182
- I don't wanna be alive.

46:22.215 --> 46:23.450
You are alive.

46:25.619 --> 46:27.154
- I don't wanna be.

46:41.234 --> 46:42.904
- Look at the miracle man.

46:42.937 --> 46:43.937
- Miracle?

46:44.906 --> 46:46.139
- You're still alive.

46:48.208 --> 46:49.208
- Yeah.

46:50.711 --> 46:52.145
- So, is it over?

46:52.880 --> 46:54.681
- Okay, let's give
this a try, okay?

46:55.616 --> 46:58.151
Come on, take it slow, no rush.

46:58.953 --> 46:59.953
Good start.

47:03.925 --> 47:04.892
- Sure.

47:04.926 --> 47:07.794
One step at
a time, there you go.

47:07.829 --> 47:08.896
Baby steps, no rush.

47:10.965 --> 47:11.933
Good.

47:11.966 --> 47:13.667
- Somehow, I don't believe you.

47:16.938 --> 47:18.672
I don't even think
you believe you.

47:22.242 --> 47:26.146
There's gonna be a
photo with you dead

47:27.949 --> 47:29.149
if you keep going.

47:30.550 --> 47:31.785
Yeah.

47:32.854 --> 47:33.921
There you go.

47:34.922 --> 47:36.790
One step at a time.

47:36.824 --> 47:38.492
- We both know that.

47:41.929 --> 47:43.697
It's your choice.

47:58.946 --> 48:02.884
- Okay, looking good.

48:02.917 --> 48:04.886
Looking really good, Will.

48:04.919 --> 48:05.853
- You don't have to lie to me.

48:05.887 --> 48:08.890
- I'm not lying to you,
you're doing great.

48:08.923 --> 48:11.425
You're gonna be outta
here before you know it.

48:14.862 --> 48:17.230
- Yeah, that's the plan.

49:55.362 --> 49:56.429
- That's fucked, man.

49:57.899 --> 49:59.566
Somebody's luggage and shit.

51:10.004 --> 51:11.806
Hey, yo!

51:11.839 --> 51:14.175
Who are you?

51:14.208 --> 51:16.878
Hey!

51:16.911 --> 51:18.179
Who are you?

51:18.212 --> 51:18.846
Hey!

51:18.880 --> 51:20.948
I asked you a question, man.

51:20.982 --> 51:21.916
- I don't want any trouble.

51:21.949 --> 51:23.050
I'm nobody.

51:23.084 --> 51:25.052
- Motherfucker, why you lying?

51:25.086 --> 51:26.988
Shit, you think I'm stupid?

51:27.021 --> 51:28.823
Come here, hey!

51:28.856 --> 51:29.856
Check this out.

51:31.225 --> 51:32.225
That's you.

51:35.963 --> 51:36.964
What are you doing here?

51:38.199 --> 51:38.798
- It's been a long day.

51:38.833 --> 51:40.134
I don't want any trouble.

51:40.167 --> 51:41.735
- Oh, looks like
you got it, man.

51:41.768 --> 51:43.804
Plenty of trouble
from what I can see.

51:43.838 --> 51:46.007
You in hot water with
them Fetter boys, huh?

51:47.909 --> 51:49.977
Yeah, maybe I can help you.

51:52.013 --> 51:53.680
- I don't need any help, either.

51:53.713 --> 51:55.415
- Okay, Willy, all right.

51:56.951 --> 51:57.951
You do you.

52:03.690 --> 52:04.959
- You know what?

52:06.093 --> 52:10.164
You know where I can get a gun?

52:13.968 --> 52:16.469
- Motherfucker,
step into my office.

52:16.503 --> 52:20.674
Yeah, I had a little run-in
myself with them Fetter boys.

52:20.707 --> 52:22.810
Yeah, you know what
I'm talking about.

52:22.843 --> 52:24.946
Rory, yeah.

52:24.979 --> 52:30.117
Motherfucker shot me, yeah,
right here, in the shoulder.

52:30.151 --> 52:31.218
Three years ago.

52:33.988 --> 52:35.056
Motherfucking asshole.

52:35.089 --> 52:36.958
Then he killed my
fucking cousin.

52:37.992 --> 52:40.161
Fuck, man, hate them guys.

52:42.997 --> 52:46.901
Yeah, it all comes down to
pain and pleasure, my man.

52:48.169 --> 52:49.236
- Pain and pleasure?

52:49.270 --> 52:50.237
- Yeah.

52:50.271 --> 52:52.974
How much pain you wanna
inflict on that fucker,

52:53.773 --> 52:56.143
and how much pleasure
you want to derive

52:56.177 --> 52:57.777
from inflicting said pain.

53:00.915 --> 53:02.984
Yeah, be my motherfucking guest.

53:05.286 --> 53:06.954
That's a Glock Nine.

53:06.988 --> 53:08.755
You can tell by the sound.

53:08.788 --> 53:11.558
That's one of the most reliable
stingers on the street.

53:11.591 --> 53:13.894
Most cops carry that exact
same model right there.

53:13.928 --> 53:15.172
That gun's so reliable
you could drop

53:15.196 --> 53:16.964
that in a pan of pancake batter,

53:16.998 --> 53:18.933
lift it up, it'll
still bang bang.

53:19.799 --> 53:22.003
Not that I would
recommend doing that.

53:25.272 --> 53:27.942
Yeah, you look like you
know what you're doing.

53:27.975 --> 53:29.977
Cop, cop, you ain't a cop.

53:30.011 --> 53:31.812
You a cop?

53:31.846 --> 53:34.015
- No, served, long time ago.

53:35.983 --> 53:36.984
- You kill anybody?

53:37.985 --> 53:38.953
- I was a marine.

53:38.986 --> 53:39.986
- So you killed people.

53:41.989 --> 53:45.960
I know, shit, you ain't
fucking around, huh?

53:45.993 --> 53:48.295
- No, sir, I am
not fucking around.

53:49.796 --> 53:52.967
- Willy, you can call me Dante.

53:53.000 --> 53:55.970
- Okay, Dante, I
would like to purchase

53:56.003 --> 53:57.972
all of your guns and munitions.

53:58.005 --> 53:59.306
How much would that cost?

54:00.041 --> 54:02.742
- Yeah, you're
gonna need 'em, man,

54:02.776 --> 54:05.813
going up against
the Fetter gang.

54:05.846 --> 54:08.115
Yeah, they some bad apples, man.

54:08.149 --> 54:12.619
So many guns, they
have many guns.

54:13.988 --> 54:15.856
All right, I'm
gonna hook you up.

54:15.890 --> 54:16.857
What's that saying?

54:16.891 --> 54:18.826
The enemy of my enemy
is my friend's enemy,

54:18.859 --> 54:20.127
or some shit like that.

54:20.161 --> 54:21.961
All right, give me 10
grand for the whole lot.

54:26.834 --> 54:27.968
- There's 10 right there.

54:28.002 --> 54:30.237
Wait a second.

54:31.638 --> 54:32.638
Let me see that.

54:37.011 --> 54:38.012
Shit!

54:39.712 --> 54:41.614
I should've asked
for more money, man.

54:43.017 --> 54:45.618
Man, anything else I
can get you, rich boy?

54:45.652 --> 54:48.055
- Nope, not unless
you can get me a car.

54:48.089 --> 54:50.858
- Let me guess, you
want one of them

54:50.891 --> 54:52.102
cars with no name on it, right?

54:52.126 --> 54:53.793
You wanna keep it clean.

54:53.828 --> 54:55.229
- That would be preferable.

54:55.262 --> 54:56.230
Shit, man, I got you covered.

54:56.263 --> 54:58.966

that, too?

54:58.999 --> 55:00.359
- How about the
car and the jacket.

55:02.870 --> 55:05.306
- Man, I love that jacket, man.

55:05.339 --> 55:07.374
This jacket right
here, this has been

55:07.408 --> 55:09.009
in my family for
three generations.

55:09.043 --> 55:11.312
My grandfather wore this jacket.

57:32.820 --> 57:33.820
He had potential.

57:35.889 --> 57:40.127
Danny was pure, but
too much like me.

You were supposed

What the?

1:00:45.112 --> 1:00:47.014
You come into my
home, motherfucker?

1:00:47.047 --> 1:00:48.148
I'll fucking kill you!

1:00:59.059 --> 1:01:00.661
I'm gonna fuck you!

1:01:24.451 --> 1:01:26.587
Oh, you motherfucker, come here!

1:01:33.060 --> 1:01:35.295
Oh, fuck, why'd you shoot me?

1:01:38.265 --> 1:01:42.269
Oh, fuck.

1:01:42.302 --> 1:01:46.340
Oh, oh, fuck, oh, goddamn.

1:01:46.373 --> 1:01:51.345
Oh, fuck, oh, goddamn,
oh, fuck, you hit me good.

1:01:51.545 --> 1:01:53.680
Oh, shit, I need an ambulance.

1:01:53.714 --> 1:01:55.115
Oh, I need an ambulance.

1:01:55.148 --> 1:01:57.050
You fucking shot me twice!

1:01:59.353 --> 1:02:00.630
- I need you to
tell me where he is.

1:02:00.654 --> 1:02:02.089
- Fuck you, I need an ambulance!

1:02:02.122 --> 1:02:05.425
Oh, God!

1:02:05.459 --> 1:02:07.261
- Where is Rory?

1:02:07.294 --> 1:02:09.096
- Okay, okay, all right.

1:02:10.597 --> 1:02:13.667
If I tell you, you promise
you'll call an ambulance?

1:02:14.568 --> 1:02:15.669
I won't die like this.

1:02:17.504 --> 1:02:20.207
- Yes, Zachary, I can do that.

1:02:22.543 --> 1:02:23.710
- You promise?

1:02:27.882 --> 1:02:28.816
He's probably at the club.

1:02:28.850 --> 1:02:30.117
He's always fucking there.

1:02:31.351 --> 1:02:32.386
- Club?

1:02:32.419 --> 1:02:34.822
- Fuck, fuck, it's
their club, man!

1:02:34.856 --> 1:02:37.357
What?

1:02:44.665 --> 1:02:45.665
- Thanks.

1:02:46.868 --> 1:02:49.236
- Okay, okay, make the call.

1:02:49.269 --> 1:02:49.871
Make the call.

1:02:49.904 --> 1:02:51.438
Where's my phone?

1:02:51.471 --> 1:02:53.841
Fuck.

1:02:53.875 --> 1:02:55.175
Come on, come on.

1:02:55.208 --> 1:02:57.244
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

1:02:57.277 --> 1:02:59.112
We had a fucking deal, man.

1:02:59.146 --> 1:03:01.114
Please, you don't
have to do this.

1:03:01.148 --> 1:03:02.850
You don't, please.

1:03:02.884 --> 1:03:04.484
I have a daughter.

1:03:06.720 --> 1:03:11.124
Fuck.

1:03:11.158 --> 1:03:12.225
Thank you.

1:03:19.800 --> 1:03:20.868
- Open or closed?

1:03:22.870 --> 1:03:23.870
- What?

1:03:25.272 --> 1:03:26.306
- Your casket.

1:03:27.875 --> 1:03:30.177
You want it open or closed?

1:04:28.769 --> 1:04:30.905
- Another one of Fetter's boys.

1:04:30.938 --> 1:04:32.205
- Yep.

1:04:34.708 --> 1:04:35.776
- Pardon me.

1:04:44.584 --> 1:04:45.987
Detective Neil Chen.

1:04:46.020 --> 1:04:47.421
Are you Donald Fetter?

1:04:49.991 --> 1:04:51.458
- What are you here for?

1:04:51.491 --> 1:04:53.493
- It seems your son
Rory and his friends

1:04:53.527 --> 1:04:54.938
are in the middle
of a little conflict

1:04:54.962 --> 1:04:57.631
with a gentleman by the
name of William Duncan.

1:05:01.568 --> 1:05:02.904
- I know all about William.

1:05:03.905 --> 1:05:05.305
He killed my son.

1:05:06.974 --> 1:05:08.742
I thought he died.

1:05:08.775 --> 1:05:10.878
- No, he's very much alive.

1:05:10.912 --> 1:05:13.915
I think he just killed another
one of your son's friends.

1:05:15.515 --> 1:05:16.316
I'll be blunt.

1:05:16.349 --> 1:05:17.819
I'm here on a
mission of goodwill

1:05:17.852 --> 1:05:20.420
to end this war, both sides.

1:05:20.454 --> 1:05:21.688
I just want it to stop.

1:05:22.489 --> 1:05:27.461
- Whatever my son has
done, that's his business.

1:05:27.494 --> 1:05:29.496
I'm not sure I can help.

1:05:30.164 --> 1:05:30.965
You can see yourself out.

1:05:30.998 --> 1:05:34.234
- Sir, I need to
speak with your son.

1:05:37.004 --> 1:05:38.371
I'm not here to arrest him.

1:05:38.405 --> 1:05:40.674
If I were, I wouldn't
be here alone.

1:05:40.707 --> 1:05:41.876
- Why should I trust you?

1:05:41.909 --> 1:05:43.310
- I know who you are, Donnie.

1:05:43.343 --> 1:05:44.879
I know all about you.

1:05:44.912 --> 1:05:45.913
Every cop does.

1:05:48.015 --> 1:05:52.920
And I know that we allow
you to do what you do,

1:05:53.855 --> 1:05:55.455
and I know that that can change.

1:05:56.523 --> 1:05:57.859
Do you want that to change?

1:06:07.434 --> 1:06:08.735
- Get your ass in here.

1:06:08.769 --> 1:06:09.871
Sure.

1:06:11.772 --> 1:06:12.773
- He'll be right in.

1:06:24.451 --> 1:06:26.686
- Who the fuck is this guy?

1:06:26.720 --> 1:06:28.823
Rory Fetter, Detective Chen.

1:06:31.358 --> 1:06:32.359
- The fuck do you want?

1:06:32.392 --> 1:06:34.427
- I know all about your
war with William Duncan.

1:06:34.461 --> 1:06:35.461
- My war?

1:06:36.898 --> 1:06:40.835
If I read the papers correctly,
William Duncan is deceased.

1:06:40.868 --> 1:06:43.737
- Oh, no, he's not.

1:06:43.770 --> 1:06:45.772
In fact, he just
killed your buddy Zach.

1:06:48.075 --> 1:06:49.877
- Zach's dead?
- Yeah.

1:06:50.644 --> 1:06:53.413
Shot three times today,
just now, in fact.

1:06:53.446 --> 1:06:54.347
- Then why are you here?

1:06:54.381 --> 1:06:57.450
Why aren't you out
chasing this murderer?

1:06:57.484 --> 1:06:58.552
- Don't know where he is.

1:06:58.585 --> 1:06:59.954
He escaped the hospital.

1:06:59.987 --> 1:07:03.356
The one that you sent
him to when you shot him,

1:07:03.390 --> 1:07:04.859
murdered his wife.

1:07:04.892 --> 1:07:05.893
- Allegedly.

1:07:07.995 --> 1:07:10.865
So, you felt that
it was a good idea

1:07:10.898 --> 1:07:14.869
to come to our place of business

1:07:14.902 --> 1:07:17.972
and tell us that this fuck-face

1:07:18.005 --> 1:07:20.674
who killed one of my
friends is on the loose

1:07:20.707 --> 1:07:21.843
and you can't catch him?

1:07:21.876 --> 1:07:24.846
- Listen, I'm actually here
on a mission of goodwill,

1:07:24.879 --> 1:07:26.646
'cause I want this all to end.

1:07:26.680 --> 1:07:27.849
He's not gonna stop.

1:07:27.882 --> 1:07:29.482
So I'm here to tell
you that maybe you

1:07:29.516 --> 1:07:30.885
should disappear for a while.

1:07:35.488 --> 1:07:36.488
- Is that all?

1:07:38.893 --> 1:07:41.028
- Yeah, that's all.

1:07:44.098 --> 1:07:45.098
- Enjoy your day.

1:07:51.806 --> 1:07:52.439
The fuck is this?

1:07:52.472 --> 1:07:53.908
This guy trying to scare us?

1:07:56.143 --> 1:07:58.045
- I want you to kill that prick.

1:08:02.049 --> 1:08:03.683
Get it over with.

1:08:03.717 --> 1:08:04.852
Go.

1:08:06.486 --> 1:08:07.754
- Right.

1:08:08.923 --> 1:08:10.757
'Cause I fucking do everything.

1:08:10.790 --> 1:08:12.159
Right, yeah.

1:08:56.170 --> 1:08:57.604
- Evening, Detective.

1:08:59.941 --> 1:09:01.675
Gun wasn't cheap.

1:09:02.642 --> 1:09:03.844
- You're telling me.

1:09:15.923 --> 1:09:18.059
- What the hell
are you doing here?

1:09:18.092 --> 1:09:20.027
- You working for them?

1:09:20.061 --> 1:09:21.494
What?

1:09:21.528 --> 1:09:22.595
You a crooked cop?

1:09:23.496 --> 1:09:25.799
- No, man, I'm trying
to fucking help you.

1:09:26.867 --> 1:09:29.769
I want this to stop, I
want all of this to stop.

1:09:29.803 --> 1:09:32.772
- I saw you at the club.

1:09:32.807 --> 1:09:34.809
- I went to tell
them about Zach.

1:09:35.475 --> 1:09:37.211
They deserve to
know what happened.

1:09:39.646 --> 1:09:41.781
How far are you gonna take this?

1:09:41.816 --> 1:09:43.550
- However far it goes, it goes.

1:09:44.218 --> 1:09:46.753
They took everything from me,

1:09:46.786 --> 1:09:47.898
and it's only a matter of time

1:09:47.922 --> 1:09:49.622
before they do it
to somebody else.

1:09:49.656 --> 1:09:51.158
- You gotta let this go.

1:09:55.762 --> 1:09:56.762
- Yeah.

1:09:57.932 --> 1:09:59.910
You know what, I didn't
think of that, you're right.

1:09:59.934 --> 1:10:01.135
I should fucking let it go.

1:10:02.103 --> 1:10:05.239
Are you even fucking listening
to anything I'm saying?

1:10:08.641 --> 1:10:09.641
Let it go?

1:10:10.277 --> 1:10:11.912
You know what these people do!

1:10:15.715 --> 1:10:18.152
- I know.
- Yeah, you know.

1:10:19.020 --> 1:10:21.055
- In fact, there have been
other initiation murders

1:10:21.088 --> 1:10:24.058
just like this, and
I knew it was them,

1:10:24.091 --> 1:10:26.861
but nothing ever fucking
sticks with these guys.

1:10:31.664 --> 1:10:33.134
- Well, well done, Barney Fife.

1:10:34.068 --> 1:10:38.139
Doing such a great job of
protecting my community!

1:10:41.942 --> 1:10:43.944
- I cannot let you
keep going like this.

1:10:45.146 --> 1:10:46.180
You know that.

1:10:46.213 --> 1:10:47.213
- I'll stop.

1:10:49.984 --> 1:10:51.318
It'll all be over very soon.

1:10:53.220 --> 1:10:54.597
But I'm telling you now,
if you get in my way,

1:10:54.621 --> 1:10:55.890
I will fucking kill you.

1:10:57.091 --> 1:10:58.091
You understand me?

1:10:59.692 --> 1:11:00.794
- Yeah, I understand.

1:11:03.831 --> 1:11:04.932
- Good.

1:11:04.965 --> 1:11:07.935
Now I don't wanna see you
again until this is over.

1:11:08.735 --> 1:11:10.703
Then I'll turn myself
in, I'll go to jail.

1:11:10.737 --> 1:11:11.915
You can give me the
lethal injection.

1:11:11.939 --> 1:11:13.007
I don't fucking care.

1:11:14.408 --> 1:11:18.012
But right now, you
need to do one thing.

1:11:18.045 --> 1:11:19.180
You look the other way.

1:11:27.988 --> 1:11:28.988
- All right.

1:11:31.892 --> 1:11:33.227
Go and get this over with.

1:11:34.895 --> 1:11:35.996
Quick.

1:11:57.852 --> 1:11:58.852
- Get in here.

1:12:02.923 --> 1:12:03.923
Sit down.

1:12:07.228 --> 1:12:08.795
Why are you still here?

1:12:10.931 --> 1:12:11.698
- What?

1:12:11.731 --> 1:12:12.500
You just asked me
to come in here.

1:12:12.533 --> 1:12:15.269
- Go take care of
William Duncan.

1:12:15.302 --> 1:12:16.871
- Don't worry about it.

1:12:16.904 --> 1:12:17.872
I'll take care of him.

1:12:17.905 --> 1:12:19.106
- Just kill him.

1:12:20.107 --> 1:12:21.876
What the fuck's wrong with you?

1:12:21.909 --> 1:12:22.910
He's one man.

1:12:23.911 --> 1:12:25.045
- I'll take care of it.

1:12:28.249 --> 1:12:29.350
- Just fucking bounce.

1:12:32.253 --> 1:12:33.253
Kill the prick.

1:12:34.922 --> 1:12:38.658
You're my son, goddamn
it, act like it for once.

1:12:41.761 --> 1:12:42.761
- I'm your son.

1:12:45.966 --> 1:12:47.434
- Pussy.

1:13:10.958 --> 1:13:12.759
- Hey, my brother!

1:13:12.792 --> 1:13:14.895
You gotta let me in there!

1:13:14.929 --> 1:13:16.363
My girl is in there!

1:13:16.397 --> 1:13:17.998
Hell, all my girls.

1:13:18.032 --> 1:13:19.766
I'm VIP!

1:13:19.799 --> 1:13:20.935
Oh, let me in, man.

1:13:59.940 --> 1:14:00.940
- Shit.

1:14:08.949 --> 1:14:09.950
You got me.

1:14:11.819 --> 1:14:13.020
- Looks that way.

1:14:16.090 --> 1:14:17.858
- Get it over with.

1:14:24.198 --> 1:14:26.200
- I don't feel anything.

1:14:32.940 --> 1:14:34.942
I'm serious, Donnie.

1:14:37.211 --> 1:14:38.211
Nothing.

1:14:41.048 --> 1:14:43.350
You know, they say the
first time is the hardest.

1:14:46.287 --> 1:14:49.857
When I killed your son
Danny, I was emotional.

1:14:53.394 --> 1:14:54.828
It felt...

1:14:56.964 --> 1:14:59.799
I think the word is visceral.

1:15:02.236 --> 1:15:03.904
Cathartic.

1:15:03.937 --> 1:15:04.937
- Yes.

1:15:05.472 --> 1:15:08.108
- But now I'm sitting
here in front of you.

1:15:10.577 --> 1:15:11.577
Nothing.

1:15:15.949 --> 1:15:17.418
Not even a shake.

1:15:17.451 --> 1:15:18.485
Is this what happens?

1:15:19.953 --> 1:15:20.954
Is this normal?

1:15:22.256 --> 1:15:23.256
You tell me.

1:15:25.959 --> 1:15:27.561
How many people you killed?

1:15:27.594 --> 1:15:29.897
Hmm, do you remember?

1:15:32.666 --> 1:15:34.935
How'd it feel when
you killed my wife?

1:15:34.968 --> 1:15:36.937
- Enough of this shit.

1:15:36.970 --> 1:15:37.971
- You feel numb then?

1:15:39.440 --> 1:15:44.411
'Cause I feel numb at the
prospect of killing you.

1:15:50.951 --> 1:15:54.221
You know, I feel a
little disappointed.

1:15:56.223 --> 1:15:57.925
- Just kill me.

1:16:05.966 --> 1:16:07.334
- Hell no!
- Shit, man!

1:16:07.368 --> 1:16:08.635
Go, go, go, go, go!

1:16:08.669 --> 1:16:09.669
Go, go!

1:16:16.977 --> 1:16:17.977
- Nothing.

1:16:53.714 --> 1:16:55.215
- Hey.

1:16:55.249 --> 1:16:56.316
Hello, Rory.

1:16:58.185 --> 1:16:59.720
- Who's this?

1:16:59.753 --> 1:17:00.753
- Who do you think?

1:17:06.026 --> 1:17:07.628
- Did you kill him?

1:17:08.762 --> 1:17:09.762
- Yep.

1:17:11.765 --> 1:17:14.234
- Well, then I'm talking
to a fucking dead man.

1:17:14.268 --> 1:17:15.708
- You can't kill
what's already dead.

1:17:25.245 --> 1:17:26.246
- Change of plans.

1:17:28.449 --> 1:17:29.516
Get back to the club.

1:17:31.752 --> 1:17:32.752
- My man.

1:18:10.190 --> 1:18:11.190
- Oh, fuck!

1:18:32.847 --> 1:18:33.847
- Sorry, brother.

1:18:35.850 --> 1:18:37.284
- What are you sorry for?

1:18:40.787 --> 1:18:45.792
He was a shit father and
a despicable human being.

1:18:49.796 --> 1:18:51.131
But that's not the point.

1:18:52.766 --> 1:18:53.367
You can't kill

1:18:53.400 --> 1:18:55.569
what's already dead, Rory.

1:19:09.884 --> 1:19:11.285
- Find him!

1:19:11.318 --> 1:19:14.087
Yeah, let's roll, let's roll.

1:20:20.787 --> 1:20:23.724

1:20:23.757 --> 1:20:24.791
You're fucking dead.

1:20:29.396 --> 1:20:30.797

1:20:32.633 --> 1:20:33.633
- So will I.

1:21:58.585 --> 1:22:00.955
- Rory, I saw that guy again.

1:22:07.527 --> 1:22:09.296
Yo, it's me.

1:22:09.329 --> 1:22:10.329
- Come in!

1:22:13.835 --> 1:22:15.635
- You got shot.

1:22:15.669 --> 1:22:16.669
- No shit.

1:22:17.939 --> 1:22:19.306
Where'd they get ya?

1:22:19.339 --> 1:22:21.541
- Shoulder, I can't reach it.

1:22:21.575 --> 1:22:23.978
- Wow, little bit
of a problem, huh?

1:22:24.011 --> 1:22:25.555
Yeah, when you get shot
in the back like that,

1:22:25.579 --> 1:22:26.824
like, hell, what
are you gonna do?

1:22:26.848 --> 1:22:28.582
Come on, stand up.

1:22:29.449 --> 1:22:30.818
Okay, sorry.

1:22:30.852 --> 1:22:32.552
Can I take a look?

1:22:33.988 --> 1:22:34.822
Oh, man.

1:22:34.856 --> 1:22:36.523
Man, that's in there deep.

1:22:37.859 --> 1:22:41.896
- You think you can
get it out with these?

1:22:41.929 --> 1:22:43.363
- I ain't no doctor, man.

1:22:43.396 --> 1:22:44.798
I don't care, just try.

1:22:44.832 --> 1:22:45.832
Just do it.

1:23:27.008 --> 1:23:27.809
- Anything?

1:23:27.842 --> 1:23:29.543
It's empty.

1:23:40.922 --> 1:23:43.557
- That's the best I can do
under the circumstances.

1:23:54.168 --> 1:23:55.937
- How are you today, sir?

1:23:55.970 --> 1:23:59.372
Do you by any chance know who
owns that brown car out there?

1:24:00.975 --> 1:24:03.677
- What is the license plate?

1:24:06.546 --> 1:24:09.416
- 4-4-0-6-2.

1:24:13.855 --> 1:24:17.624
- I don't know, it's
not in the system.

1:24:17.657 --> 1:24:18.658
- That's okay.

1:24:18.692 --> 1:24:21.695
Thank you.

1:24:21.728 --> 1:24:22.864
- Yo, what the fuck, man?

1:24:24.764 --> 1:24:25.764
- He didn't know.

1:24:36.878 --> 1:24:37.879
- Look at that shit.

1:24:39.947 --> 1:24:40.947
Can I keep this?

1:24:51.691 --> 1:24:53.727
- Willy!

1:24:57.098 --> 1:25:00.835
Oh, Willy, Willy boy!

1:25:00.868 --> 1:25:01.869
- Who the fuck is that?

1:25:02.870 --> 1:25:03.871
- It's them.

1:25:04.872 --> 1:25:05.973
They must've followed me.

1:25:07.875 --> 1:25:09.076
- Yeah.

1:25:09.110 --> 1:25:10.477
Oh, Willy!

1:25:10.510 --> 1:25:12.479
- Looks like they
brought company, bro.

1:25:13.881 --> 1:25:14.881
Fucking hell.

1:25:16.817 --> 1:25:21.454
- You're the next contestant
on "It's Time to Fucking Die!"

1:25:25.192 --> 1:25:25.993
- You ready?

1:25:26.027 --> 1:25:26.827
- Yep.

1:25:26.861 --> 1:25:27.861
- All right, here we go.

1:25:34.969 --> 1:25:36.137
Oh, shit!

1:25:40.808 --> 1:25:41.808
Move out!

1:25:51.152 --> 1:25:52.619
Damn it.

1:25:52.652 --> 1:25:53.652
Move out!

1:25:54.221 --> 1:25:56.023
Shit, fuck!

1:25:56.057 --> 1:25:57.057
- Go.

1:26:04.065 --> 1:26:05.532
Stay down, stay down!

1:26:17.178 --> 1:26:18.178
Come on!

1:26:27.922 --> 1:26:28.922
- Shit!

1:26:45.239 --> 1:26:46.706
Fucking hell, man.

1:26:57.318 --> 1:26:59.220
- Fuck, go, go, go, go!

1:27:00.587 --> 1:27:01.822
Go, go, go!

1:27:04.291 --> 1:27:06.827
- Better not try to shoot
out my tires or some shit.

1:27:06.861 --> 1:27:08.195
You know how much
tires are, man?

1:27:11.232 --> 1:27:13.067
- Come on, Willy,
come on, Willy!

1:27:13.100 --> 1:27:14.144
- They're fucking expensive,

1:27:14.168 --> 1:27:17.071
and I know they're
800-fucking-dollars per tire!

1:27:17.104 --> 1:27:20.207
Let's go, let's fucking
do it, let's go!

1:27:22.877 --> 1:27:25.112
I should've fucking seen her.

1:27:27.848 --> 1:27:29.749
Fuck you,
you're right on him, bro.

1:27:29.783 --> 1:27:30.784
Come on.

1:27:30.818 --> 1:27:31.718
Fuck!

1:27:31.751 --> 1:27:32.786
Come on, get close,

1:27:32.820 --> 1:27:34.100
get close, get close, get close!

1:27:34.822 --> 1:27:35.822
Go!

1:27:47.234 --> 1:27:48.601
- Fucking hell, man.

1:27:51.305 --> 1:27:53.040
Go, fuck this bitch!

1:27:53.074 --> 1:27:54.707
Fuck, get those motherfuckers!

1:28:02.383 --> 1:28:04.819
- Come on, man, pick
up, pick up, pick up.

1:28:04.852 --> 1:28:06.921
- Yo, what's up,
what's good, my dude?

1:28:06.954 --> 1:28:08.823
- Roach, man, I need your help!

1:28:09.689 --> 1:28:10.623
Get those motherfuckers!

1:28:10.657 --> 1:28:12.135
- Yo, man, you bringing
me some noise, man?

1:28:12.159 --> 1:28:13.793
Got no choice, man!

1:28:13.828 --> 1:28:14.794
They trying to kill my ass!

1:28:14.829 --> 1:28:15.996
- Now, here?

1:28:16.030 --> 1:28:16.831
Really, man?

1:28:16.864 --> 1:28:19.233
I'm coming in hot, bro.

1:28:19.266 --> 1:28:21.801
- I got you, don't
worry about it.

1:28:22.802 --> 1:28:23.636
- What the fuck is up?

1:28:23.670 --> 1:28:24.839
- That's an old friend.

1:28:24.872 --> 1:28:26.807
He's gonna take care of us.

1:28:26.841 --> 1:28:27.842
If we can get there.

1:28:29.210 --> 1:28:31.812
- Listen up, everyone, incoming.

1:28:31.846 --> 1:28:32.745
Load up.

1:28:32.779 --> 1:28:34.681
In a few hot seconds,
some real bad guys

1:28:34.714 --> 1:28:35.682
are gonna come up here, so keep

1:28:35.715 --> 1:28:38.819
your fucking head on a
swivel, and stay frosty

1:28:38.853 --> 1:28:41.255
'cause a bunch of shit is
about to pop the fuck off.

1:29:00.975 --> 1:29:02.810
- Woo, come on!

1:29:05.045 --> 1:29:07.982
- Fucking A, man,
we're doing it!

1:29:08.015 --> 1:29:08.781
Did we lose them?

1:29:08.816 --> 1:29:11.152
Oh, fuck me, shit,
my ass, damn it!

1:29:18.859 --> 1:29:20.094
Come on, come on!

1:29:27.767 --> 1:29:28.903
Back up, back up!

1:29:37.011 --> 1:29:41.015
- Woo, my man, you
saved my ass, man.

1:29:41.048 --> 1:29:42.816
- You're my best parts supplier.

1:29:42.850 --> 1:29:43.994
You know I'm not gonna
let you die, brother.

1:29:44.018 --> 1:29:46.153
- Fucking A, bro, thank you.

1:29:46.187 --> 1:29:47.421
- Who the fuck is he?

1:29:47.454 --> 1:29:49.823
- Man, that's the
guy they're after.

1:29:49.857 --> 1:29:51.192
- What the fuck did you do?

1:29:52.326 --> 1:29:53.326
- It's a long story.

1:29:54.361 --> 1:29:55.829
- Man, you that
crazy motherfucker

1:29:55.863 --> 1:29:58.232
that's killing all
these fucks on TV, man.

1:29:58.265 --> 1:29:59.732
- I don't watch the news.

1:29:59.766 --> 1:30:00.911
- Well, I'm crazy, and
you better be happy

1:30:00.935 --> 1:30:02.102
that I am.

1:30:09.109 --> 1:30:10.344
- Get back, get back!

1:30:24.692 --> 1:30:26.227
Going to hell in
smoke, motherfucker.

1:30:26.260 --> 1:30:27.760
Say hello to God.

1:30:29.897 --> 1:30:30.897
- Got ya.

1:30:35.869 --> 1:30:36.869
- I'm out!

1:30:39.139 --> 1:30:40.441
- I got you!

1:30:41.976 --> 1:30:42.976
Go!

1:31:09.436 --> 1:31:11.472
Help, please.

1:31:19.079 --> 1:31:20.079
- Willy.

1:31:23.350 --> 1:31:24.885
Willy!

1:31:27.054 --> 1:31:28.322
Oh, William!

1:31:31.392 --> 1:31:32.392
Willy!

1:31:35.629 --> 1:31:37.464
How many people
have to die, Will?

1:31:42.870 --> 1:31:45.839
You killed my father, Willy,

1:31:45.873 --> 1:31:49.009
which I don't really blame you.

1:31:53.080 --> 1:31:54.315
But Danny...

1:31:57.885 --> 1:31:59.853
Danny I didn't want to die.

1:32:03.257 --> 1:32:04.925
I fucking loved him.

1:32:06.927 --> 1:32:11.098
He wasn't made for this
world like you and I.

1:32:11.131 --> 1:32:12.131
No, no.

1:32:14.435 --> 1:32:17.137
No, you have to stop.

1:32:19.406 --> 1:32:22.009
It's over now.

1:32:22.042 --> 1:32:23.042
It's over, Willy.

1:32:23.677 --> 1:32:27.881
I told you I would get you,

1:32:30.517 --> 1:32:31.652
and I got you.

1:32:35.322 --> 1:32:36.657
And I got you.

1:33:15.696 --> 1:33:17.431
- Got you.

1:33:55.369 --> 1:33:57.137
All right, everybody move!

1:33:57.171 --> 1:33:58.472
You two go around back!

1:34:02.609 --> 1:34:03.610
- Go!
- Go!

1:34:10.617 --> 1:34:11.617
Hey, hurry up.

1:34:22.029 --> 1:34:23.697
- Welcome to the party, fellas.

1:34:29.703 --> 1:34:30.703
- Got your guy.

1:34:33.707 --> 1:34:34.708
- Yeah.

1:34:36.109 --> 1:34:37.711
Wanna go get a drink?

1:34:40.747 --> 1:34:42.683
- Can't have you die on me.

1:34:42.716 --> 1:34:44.151
You caused a lot of damage.

1:34:49.723 --> 1:34:54.728
You better arrest me.

1:35:05.506 --> 1:35:07.274
- I hope it was worth it.
