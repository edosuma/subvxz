the latest article about us?

09:23.029 --> 09:24.864

something about it, so...

to call would be

10:49.415 --> 10:51.083

talking about?

10:51.150 --> 10:54.353

"I hope Amber knows this,"

treat you that way,

{\an3}but this man today
does not treat me that way.

11:11.137 --> 11:12.705

something to assume

11:12.772 --> 11:14.240
