01:18.078 --> 01:20.496
Vince, this is the fifth
fucking message I left.

01:20.581 --> 01:23.040
Will you call me back please?

01:23.167 --> 01:25.293
- Where is he?
- Easy, E.

01:25.377 --> 01:27.670
He's with the jewelry store girl.
Let him fuck in peace.

01:27.838 --> 01:30.548
We got Amanda at 1:00. He won't call me
back. You're not worried?

01:30.674 --> 01:31.758
No, I'm more worried about Turtle

01:31.842 --> 01:33.509
jerking off Pauly Shore
for the past half hour.

01:33.969 --> 01:35.887
Yeah, what's your problem
with Pauly again, Drama?

01:35.971 --> 01:38.014
- Why do you hate him?
- It shouldn't matter why I hate him.

01:38.098 --> 01:40.391
We're family.
If I hate him, you gotta hate him.

01:40.476 --> 01:42.894
All right, I hate him.
I hate him.

01:43.187 --> 01:46.439
You are one Benedict Arnold traitorous
motherfucker, you know that, Turtle?

01:46.523 --> 01:48.107
- Easy, Drama.
- No, don't "easy" me

01:48.192 --> 01:49.901
when you're making nice
with my mortal enemy over there.

01:50.027 --> 01:51.486
I didn't make nice, okay?

01:51.570 --> 01:54.238
In fact, if it makes you feel better,
I told Pauly to go fuck himself.

01:56.116 --> 01:57.700
That does make me feel good.

01:58.410 --> 01:59.786
So what did he
want anyway?

01:59.870 --> 02:02.955
He's got some stupid new hidden camera
show called "Gotcha. "

02:03.332 --> 02:04.499
It's like a rip off
of "Punk'd. "

02:04.750 --> 02:06.959
- Yeah?
- Yeah, and he wanted to "get" you.

02:07.169 --> 02:08.877
- Really?
- Yeah, for the premiere episode.

02:09.128 --> 02:11.798
And he wanted me to be the rat-faced
accomplice. Can you believe that?

02:11.965 --> 02:14.091
I guess he thinks your series
is gonna be a hit, Drama.

02:14.176 --> 02:17.053
Yeah, I guess so.
Fucking user.

02:18.847 --> 02:20.139
I'm in.

02:20.390 --> 02:23.643
- You're in?
- Yeah, I'll do the jerkoff's show.

02:23.727 --> 02:25.853
It's a hidden camera show. You already
know about it. You can't do it.

02:25.938 --> 02:28.356
I'll act like I don't know about it.
I can pull it off.

02:28.440 --> 02:30.817
You see the billboard?

02:31.860 --> 02:33.027
Call him, Turtle.

02:33.362 --> 02:35.321
- Okay.
- Call Vince again.

02:35.405 --> 02:36.906
I called three times already.

02:37.032 --> 02:38.616
Let him fuck in peace.

02:38.826 --> 02:40.910
Fine, I'll call him.

02:46.166 --> 02:48.125
Are you going to ignore
your phone all day?

02:48.252 --> 02:50.586
Well, this is a one-time thing.
I'm making the most of it.

02:52.756 --> 02:55.800
So listen, the People's Choice
people need an answer.

02:56.301 --> 02:57.677
Do you want
to be a presenter at the show?

02:57.761 --> 02:59.345
Wow.

02:59.429 --> 03:02.181
- All business.
- Not all business,

03:02.432 --> 03:04.600
but might as well get it
out of the way, right?

03:04.810 --> 03:06.018
Do you wanna do it?

03:06.103 --> 03:09.522
Honestly? No.
Do you think I should?

03:10.774 --> 03:12.024
Not really.

03:12.734 --> 03:14.485
So it's a pass.

03:14.570 --> 03:16.487
I guess so.

03:16.572 --> 03:18.948
See how easy that was,
if you're just honest with me?

03:19.032 --> 03:20.700
Well, from now on
I always will be.

03:20.868 --> 03:22.076
Good.

03:22.703 --> 03:23.953
So...

03:24.913 --> 03:27.039
this was fun, huh?

03:27.958 --> 03:29.125
Yes this was,

03:29.209 --> 03:30.543
but until I vacate
the premises,

03:30.627 --> 03:32.920
this still is
the one time.

03:33.338 --> 03:35.339
Uh-oh.

03:35.591 --> 03:37.758
How come anytime
I ask you to take a day you can't,

03:37.843 --> 03:40.928
but your little "pledge brother" comes
to visit and you clear your calendar?

03:41.013 --> 03:43.014
Because every time you ask,
I have a very important meeting.

03:43.098 --> 03:44.390
Just luck of the draw, baby.

03:44.474 --> 03:46.100
Why is he staying
with us anyway?

03:46.184 --> 03:49.353
'Cause not everyone can afford
a hotel room in Beverly Hills.

03:49.438 --> 03:51.480
Well, not everybody likes to get
sexually harassed

03:51.565 --> 03:52.940
by your fraternity brothers.

03:53.025 --> 03:54.859
We have not seen Scott Siegal
in 10 years.

03:54.943 --> 03:57.028
- Let's not live in the past.
- Oh, the past where he would yell

03:57.112 --> 03:58.613
"Hey, Sweet-ass" at me and you
would laugh like an idiot?

03:58.864 --> 04:00.823
- It was funny.
- Yeah? I never thought so.

04:00.908 --> 04:02.950
That's because you don't
have a sense of humor.

04:03.035 --> 04:06.245
Do you know that he was ahead
of Conan O'Brien at the Lampoon?

04:06.330 --> 04:08.414
Yeah, and now he's making 'em laugh
as a bartender at Hooters.

04:08.498 --> 04:10.708
- Who'da thunk it?
- That's when he was 27.

04:10.792 --> 04:13.169
He could be manager
of the Hooters for all we know.

04:13.253 --> 04:15.713
And the fiancee
is staying here also?

04:15.797 --> 04:17.839
No, he's gonna actually keep her
locked up in the car.

04:18.132 --> 04:19.132
Well, he probably should

04:19.216 --> 04:21.093
if she's anything like the girl
that he brought to the wedding.

04:21.178 --> 04:22.929
Be nice. Scott could never get
good-looking women,

04:23.013 --> 04:24.889
but at least he's
found love.

04:24.973 --> 04:26.849
Oh, God, I hope she's not
another shot-putter.

04:28.685 --> 04:31.187
- He's early.
- Be nice.

04:33.023 --> 04:36.025
There they are! The most powerful
couple in L.A., huh?

04:36.151 --> 04:39.528
- Scotty, my man, how are you doing?
- Good to see you, great.

04:39.696 --> 04:42.073
Wow, look at you.

04:42.157 --> 04:43.699
You haven't aged a day.
What do you do,

04:43.784 --> 04:45.493
- Pilates three days a week?
- Stop it.

04:45.577 --> 04:46.911
Come here,
let me feel that tautness.

04:48.080 --> 04:49.121
It's a joke.
I'm kidding.

04:49.206 --> 04:51.207
A little humor
for old time's sake.

04:51.291 --> 04:53.125
- You look gorgeous. Get over here.
- Thank you.

04:53.210 --> 04:54.835
- Can I get a hug or what?
- Okay. Yes.

04:56.129 --> 04:58.756
Scotty, where's this
alleged fiancee of yours?

04:58.840 --> 05:00.299
Oh, she's coming.
She's coming.

05:00.384 --> 05:02.760
Hey, baby! Come here, I wanna
show you off.

05:02.886 --> 05:04.595
Okay, babe, just give me
a second, okay?

05:04.680 --> 05:05.805
All right.

05:07.849 --> 05:09.517
ARl: Holy shit.

05:09.601 --> 05:11.227
Yeah, I scored
big time, huh?

05:12.270 --> 05:13.396
And Jewish.

05:13.897 --> 05:15.815
- Come on.
- Well, she's converting.

05:15.899 --> 05:18.442
Gonna have her bat mitzvah
three weeks before the wedding.

05:18.527 --> 05:20.903
It could have been you
if you didn't reject me so many times.

05:21.363 --> 05:22.655
- Oh, I missed you.
- Hi.

05:22.739 --> 05:24.740
- How are you doing?
- I'm sorry, I'm so sorry, hi.

05:24.950 --> 05:26.575
- This is Lori, Ari.
- Hi, hello.

05:26.660 --> 05:28.744
- Hi, it's nice to meet you.
- Baby, meet the only girl

05:28.829 --> 05:30.246
that could have kept us
from being together.

05:30.330 --> 05:32.081
I don't think so.

05:32.249 --> 05:34.083
Hi, it's nice
to meet you.

05:34.251 --> 05:36.585
So nice to meet you.

05:38.255 --> 05:40.256
He don't suspect
a thing, Pauly.

05:40.382 --> 05:42.091
No, not a thing.

05:42.759 --> 05:45.553
Yes, I'll bring him
to the marina myself.

05:46.013 --> 05:48.597
1:00, all right.
Peace.

05:48.682 --> 05:51.308
- We're in.
- Yes! This is gonna be sweet.

05:51.393 --> 05:53.436
- Yeah, if you don't overact.
Oh, please.

05:53.603 --> 05:55.688
Like Sandy Meisner
always said to me...

05:56.523 --> 05:58.607
through the pages
of his books, of course...

05:58.692 --> 06:00.484
- Of course.
- "Be in the moment. "

06:01.653 --> 06:03.112
Jesus, finally.
Where the fuck are you?

06:03.280 --> 06:05.698
I'm at the house.
Where are you?

06:07.451 --> 06:08.868
I don't have a key.

06:08.952 --> 06:10.536
You know we got Amanda
in an hour, right?

06:10.620 --> 06:12.163
No, I didn't know that.
Why would I know that?

06:12.247 --> 06:14.040
'Cause I left you
five messages.

06:14.124 --> 06:16.959
You know I don't know how to check
voice mail. Why are we meeting her?

06:17.044 --> 06:18.711
You said you would
apologize for last night.

06:19.254 --> 06:21.297
Oh, right.
Okay, I will. I'll call her.

06:21.381 --> 06:23.424
All right, look, Vince, I don't want
anything hanging over this relationship,

06:23.508 --> 06:25.801
so I already called her office and set
the meeting. You okay with that?

06:26.470 --> 06:27.720
- Oh, yeah.
- Okay.

06:27.804 --> 06:29.472
- I got another pilot today, bro'.
- Really?

06:29.556 --> 06:30.598
Yeah.

06:32.142 --> 06:34.727
That was very
chivalrous, Vince.

06:34.811 --> 06:36.854
It's been a long time since a man
has sent me flowers

06:36.938 --> 06:38.064
that wasn't business related.

06:38.148 --> 06:40.524
Well this was business
related, wasn't it?

06:40.734 --> 06:43.569
- Don't be fresh.
- Okay, okay.

06:44.780 --> 06:47.364
So apparently Eric put lunch
on the books for today.

06:47.449 --> 06:50.159
I know. He wants me to apologize
for last night.

06:50.368 --> 06:52.828
- For which part?
- The part he was there for.

06:52.996 --> 06:54.997
Well, you can tell him
we handled it.

06:55.165 --> 06:57.500
I'd rather not.

06:58.168 --> 06:59.376
So what do you suggest?

06:59.503 --> 07:01.295
I don't know.
I think we should go to lunch.

07:01.379 --> 07:02.755
I'd hate for him
to feel slighted.

07:03.715 --> 07:05.674
You boys have
a very strange relationship.

07:06.343 --> 07:07.760
What, lunch would be so bad?

07:07.844 --> 07:10.221
Do you wanna go
so Eric won't feel slighted

07:11.014 --> 07:13.474
or do you wanna go because you
can't wait to see me again?

07:13.850 --> 07:15.476
I don't know.
Maybe both.

07:16.019 --> 07:18.187
Well, maybe
it won't be so bad.

07:21.191 --> 07:22.983
The real key
to these things, Turtle,

07:23.068 --> 07:24.693
is to go down
with some dignity,

07:24.778 --> 07:27.154
and not disgrace the good Chase name
by whimpering

07:27.239 --> 07:29.490
like Justin Timberlake did
when he got "Punk'd. "

07:29.574 --> 07:32.535
Like you didn't cry
when the IRS seized your condo.

07:32.702 --> 07:36.205
What a man does in the sanctity
of his own home is his business, Turtle.

07:36.373 --> 07:39.458
What he does on
national TV is the nation's.

07:40.001 --> 07:41.544
Whoa, look at all the extras.

07:42.045 --> 07:44.213
They must have spent
a fortune to pull this off.

07:44.297 --> 07:46.841
Either that or they're
only here to eat and shop.

07:47.008 --> 07:48.634
There's a spot right there.
Take it.

07:52.597 --> 07:54.431
Hey, we were here
first, asshole!

07:55.225 --> 07:57.977
- Yo, move the car.
- Easy, Drama. That's Chuck Liddell.

07:58.061 --> 08:00.938
- What's a Chuck Liddell?
- The guy's the Ultimate Fighting champ.

08:01.106 --> 08:03.482
They call him "The Iceman. "
He KO'd Randy Couture twice last year.

08:04.693 --> 08:06.110
I'm giving him the spot
out of respect.

08:06.194 --> 08:09.697
Don't be a schmuck, Turtle.
Liddell's the "got. "

08:09.906 --> 08:11.907
- You think?
- Yeah, no doubt.

08:11.992 --> 08:13.284
Check out the hidden camera van

08:13.368 --> 08:15.327
parked conveniently right next
to the empty spot.

08:15.412 --> 08:17.163
I don't see any cameras, Drama.

08:17.247 --> 08:19.665
They're in there, Turtle.
Trust me, they're in there.

08:21.251 --> 08:22.376
You guys gonna move?

08:22.460 --> 08:25.045
- I ain't taking any chances.
- We're not going anywhere.

08:25.130 --> 08:28.299
We leave this spot, Pauly's gonna come
running out, calling me a pussy.

08:28.383 --> 08:30.843
If that happens,
my street cred will be toast.

08:34.681 --> 08:36.515
Come on, Drama!

08:37.017 --> 08:39.351
C'est la vie,
Turtle my boy.

08:40.020 --> 08:43.147
- Let the games begin.
Look, buddy.

08:43.231 --> 08:45.608
- I was here first.
- I don't think so.

08:45.817 --> 08:47.401
That spot's ours.

08:47.485 --> 08:49.862
So why don't you and your
hooptie just move along now?

08:49.946 --> 08:52.198
- My what?
- Your hooptie. Your beater.

08:52.282 --> 08:54.283
Your hunk ofjunk.
Move along.

08:54.451 --> 08:56.535
You should watch who you're talking
to like that, my friend.

08:56.620 --> 09:00.122
I ain't your friend, tough guy.
Yeah, that's right,

09:00.207 --> 09:02.666
I know who you are,
you WWF wannabe.

09:03.168 --> 09:06.337
So are you gonna move your car? Or do I
gotta get in there and move it for you?

09:08.381 --> 09:10.466
Daddy?

09:13.303 --> 09:14.970
You're lucky
my daughter's in the car.

09:15.055 --> 09:16.639
I'd kick every
tooth in your head out.

09:16.806 --> 09:18.766
Yeah, and I would rip
your foot off when you tried.

09:19.059 --> 09:21.393
Whoa, Mr. Liddell,
please don't hit me, okay?

09:21.478 --> 09:24.396
Sorry about my friend.
He just didn't take his meds today.

09:25.273 --> 09:26.774
I'll see you around, friend.

09:26.858 --> 09:30.027
Yeah, I hope so, Chuckie.
I hope so.

09:32.781 --> 09:33.906
Big fan.

09:35.075 --> 09:36.951
What do you think about
that for a performance?

09:37.285 --> 09:39.870
I think that was
the sickest thing I ever seen.

09:39.955 --> 09:42.581
Yeah, so sick Pauly
didn't even wanna come out of hiding.

09:42.666 --> 09:44.250
I'm gonna go park the car.

09:44.334 --> 09:45.668
I'm gonna find Pauly.

09:46.670 --> 09:48.671
Pauly!

09:57.013 --> 09:59.431
Hey Mister!
Wanna buy a box of cookies?

09:59.849 --> 10:02.977
Sure, sweetheart.
Anything for the Girl Scouts.

10:03.395 --> 10:05.896
Oh, that's my favorite.
What do I owe you?

10:06.231 --> 10:07.690
$200.

10:08.108 --> 10:11.402
$200 for a box of cookies?
I don't think so.

10:11.528 --> 10:13.112
Pay up, Grandpa...

10:13.530 --> 10:15.698
or I'm gonna scream.

10:16.032 --> 10:17.199
So scream.

10:18.368 --> 10:19.660
He stole my cookies!

10:19.744 --> 10:21.412
All right, don't scream.
Don't scream, don't...

10:21.496 --> 10:24.498
Okay, all right,
whoa whoa whoa. Here...

10:24.874 --> 10:26.583
Get away from me,
you rotten kids!

10:26.668 --> 10:28.585
All right,
here, take it!

10:29.254 --> 10:30.963
Gotcha, Drama!

10:31.047 --> 10:34.216
You got "got!"

10:34.968 --> 10:37.011
- I got what?
- You got got!

10:37.095 --> 10:39.013
You got got!
You got got!

10:39.097 --> 10:41.390
This is your "got," Pauly?
What about Liddell?

10:41.474 --> 10:43.475
- What about what?
- Chuck Liddell, where's he at?

10:43.560 --> 10:46.854
I don't know anything about no Chuck
Liddell, Drama, but what I do know is...

10:47.397 --> 10:49.898
You got got!

10:54.446 --> 10:55.988
- How does that feel, babe?
- It feels good.

10:56.072 --> 10:57.823
Huh?
That feels good.

10:58.116 --> 11:00.534
How the fuck did he get her?
Seriously.

11:00.785 --> 11:02.911
- What, are you jealous?
- No.

11:05.373 --> 11:06.332
Maybe.

11:06.416 --> 11:08.917
Well, if that's what you want, Ari,
it's not too late.

11:09.336 --> 11:11.003
Over 10 years of marriage
and no pre-nup...

11:11.087 --> 11:13.297
- I think it's a little past too late.
- Whatever.

11:13.381 --> 11:14.882
Don't "whatever" me.
Answer the question, baby.

11:15.050 --> 11:17.092
How the fuck could he have
possibly gotten that?

11:17.177 --> 11:19.345
- Ari, he is one of your oldest friends.
- I love him, baby,

11:19.429 --> 11:21.680
but in college
he couldn't close a screen door.

11:21.765 --> 11:24.558
I think you were right.
It seems like he's changed.

11:25.101 --> 11:27.603
- The sexual harasser?
- Well, he's grown into himself.

11:27.687 --> 11:29.229
He wanted to feel your tautness.

11:29.314 --> 11:32.483
Well I guess Pilates has paid off.
Nice that somebody noticed.

11:36.696 --> 11:38.155
Two meals in two days.

11:38.239 --> 11:40.282
I'm starting to feel like
one of the popular kids.

11:40.575 --> 11:45.871
Well...

11:47.040 --> 11:48.123
this is awkward.

11:48.291 --> 11:50.125
- Last night was awkward.
Oh, last night.

11:50.293 --> 11:51.710
No, it's fine, Eric.

11:51.795 --> 11:54.213
- Really, it is.
- No, it's not fine, Amanda.

11:54.464 --> 11:56.298
I think when Vince called you "cute"
it came off in a way

11:56.383 --> 11:57.966
that I don't think he meant
for it to come off as.

11:58.760 --> 11:59.927
How so?

12:01.388 --> 12:02.471
You know...

12:02.555 --> 12:04.139
why am I talking?
Vince, do you wanna talk?

12:04.391 --> 12:06.183
Sure, what do you
want me to say?

12:06.601 --> 12:08.936
- You should say "I'm sorry. "
- I'm sorry, Amanda.

12:09.145 --> 12:10.229
For what exactly?

12:12.190 --> 12:13.482
For calling you cute.

12:14.192 --> 12:15.818
So you don't think I'm cute?

12:15.985 --> 12:17.569
No, I think you're cute,

12:17.654 --> 12:19.863
- but Eric doesn't think...
- Oh, Eric doesn't think I'm cute.

12:19.989 --> 12:21.198
No, I just...

12:21.324 --> 12:23.867
I think it was inappropriate for Vince
to say that. I mean, wasn't it?

12:24.494 --> 12:27.329
Oh, well,
it may have been,

12:27.580 --> 12:30.582
but I mean, my feeling is that
Vince didn't mean it

12:30.667 --> 12:33.127
to demean me,
and I didn't take it that way.

12:33.920 --> 12:35.170
Am I right, Vince?

12:35.255 --> 12:36.422
Yes, you are.

12:36.589 --> 12:38.382
Completely.
But Eric is right as well,

12:38.466 --> 12:39.925
because me calling you cute

12:40.009 --> 12:43.095
might actually make you think
that I look at you as a sex object,

12:43.179 --> 12:45.055
when in fact,
I see you

12:45.348 --> 12:48.934
as one of the smartest,
most interesting women

12:49.018 --> 12:50.352
I have ever met.

12:51.604 --> 12:54.523
- Well, thank you.
- As well as beautiful.

12:54.691 --> 12:56.608
- Thank you again.
- You're welcome again.

12:57.527 --> 13:00.446
So we're all good then?

13:02.866 --> 13:06.618
- Yeah, I guess.
- Great. So what else is happening?

13:06.703 --> 13:08.162
We were gonna discuss whether
or not Vince

13:08.246 --> 13:09.705
should present at
the People's Choice Awards.

13:09.831 --> 13:11.915
- Oh, yeah? What do you think?
- I don't think he should do it.

13:12.041 --> 13:13.709
Me either.

13:13.793 --> 13:15.794
Jinx.

13:17.464 --> 13:20.424
I can't believe you fucked her.
This is so fucked.

13:20.508 --> 13:22.217
I don't know what you're making
such a big deal about.

13:22.302 --> 13:23.719
You don't know what I'm making
such a big deal about?

13:23.845 --> 13:26.138
- You're fucking your agent.
- I am not fucking my agent.

13:26.222 --> 13:28.891
- What does that mean?
- It means we had sex.

13:29.184 --> 13:31.435
Once. That's it.
It wasn't emotional,

13:31.519 --> 13:33.312
- and now it's over.
- It wasn't emotional.

13:33.396 --> 13:35.105
You guys were like a bad
Meg Ryan movie in there.

13:35.190 --> 13:36.940
Well, it was her idea,
not mine.

13:37.275 --> 13:40.319
She was right.
You know, now I can focus on work

13:40.403 --> 13:44.740
instead of wondering, you know,
what it would have been like.

13:47.494 --> 13:49.703
E, seriously,
it's all good.

13:49.829 --> 13:52.331
Just don't say anything to Amanda.
It could really fuck things up.

13:52.415 --> 13:53.999
- Oh, yeah, like they're not already?
- No, they're not.

13:54.083 --> 13:58.003
They're fine. I promise, okay?
Say "okay. "

13:58.129 --> 14:01.131
- Okay.
- Just let it go already, Drama?

14:01.257 --> 14:02.382
Let what go?
- Let it go?

14:02.467 --> 14:05.093
I've got a lifetime of looking over
my shoulder to look forward to.

14:05.178 --> 14:07.429
- I'm like Henry Hill.
So what happened?

14:08.014 --> 14:10.140
- Chuck Liddell is gonna kill me.
- Chuck Liddell is?

14:10.225 --> 14:11.433
- Yeah.
- The UFC guy?

14:11.518 --> 14:12.518
- Yeah.
- He's big.

14:12.602 --> 14:13.852
Why would Chuck Liddell
wanna kill you?

14:13.937 --> 14:16.605
Because the universe hates this current
wave of success I'm having.

14:16.731 --> 14:18.732
- Johnny...
- I can't even speak, bro.

14:18.816 --> 14:19.983
What the fuck
is going on, Turtle?

14:20.068 --> 14:21.860
Yeah, Turtle.
What the fuck is going on?

14:21.945 --> 14:23.612
It's nothing, really.

14:23.696 --> 14:25.781
Yes, he did get into
a little altercation with Chuck,

14:25.865 --> 14:28.617
but that doesn't matter.
Chuck doesn't even know who he is.

14:30.119 --> 14:32.162
Well well well,
John Chase.

14:32.705 --> 14:34.623
It's your old friend
Chuck Liddell.

14:35.500 --> 14:37.834
What are the odds?
I get back to my house,

14:37.919 --> 14:39.253
look out my window,

14:39.337 --> 14:41.672
and see your chicken neck
staring back at me

14:41.756 --> 14:44.466
from some douchebag
fucking NBC billboard.

14:44.634 --> 14:46.718
Well I found you,
John Chase,

14:47.262 --> 14:50.639
and I'm sure glad I did.
I'll be seeing you soon, John.

14:51.432 --> 14:52.849
Very soon.

14:54.978 --> 14:56.311
I'm a dead man.

14:58.356 --> 15:00.482
MRS. ARl: It is absolutely
beautiful, Lori.

15:00.567 --> 15:02.109
Scott, it's beautiful.

15:02.193 --> 15:03.902
- It's blood-free too. It costs extra,
- MRS. ARl: Mmm.

15:03.987 --> 15:07.155
But Scotty wanted to be assured that no
Africans lost any limbs for this.

15:07.240 --> 15:09.700
- Well, we all have to do our part.
- Yeah.

15:09.867 --> 15:12.911
- ARl: Is it real?
- Come on, what are you, kidding?

15:13.162 --> 15:15.872
Look at that thing.
It's a four-carat "D" color, man.

15:15.957 --> 15:17.332
That thing cost
more than my car.

15:17.417 --> 15:20.168
I wouldn't brag about that, Scotty.
What are you driving?

15:20.253 --> 15:21.795
You still
got that Caprice...

15:23.006 --> 15:24.590
That you held onto
for 10 years after college?

15:24.674 --> 15:26.758
- Oh, remember that piece of crap?
- Yeah.

15:26.843 --> 15:28.802
- Oh my God.
- No no.

15:29.053 --> 15:31.179
I got the new Bentley GT now.

15:31.264 --> 15:34.349
- He bought me one too for Hanukkah.
- Chhh-anukkah.

15:34.517 --> 15:36.518
Chanukah.
- Bentleys, huh?

15:36.603 --> 15:38.979
That pension plan must be
really paying off at Hooters.

15:39.063 --> 15:40.063
Ari.

15:41.524 --> 15:42.733
You still working
at Hooters, Scotty?

15:43.901 --> 15:44.943
You didn't tell...
You worked at Hooters?

15:45.028 --> 15:46.778
Years ago.
Don't hold it against me.

15:46.863 --> 15:48.238
It was back during my

15:48.323 --> 15:50.574
"make-my-parents-feel-like-
they-fucked-me-up" phase.

15:50.658 --> 15:52.534
I know that phase.
Two years skiing in Aspen,

15:52.619 --> 15:55.120
- and then I was an actress.
- Culinary school,

15:55.204 --> 15:57.372
but then I finally got it together
and went to med school.

15:57.498 --> 15:59.458
- What, you're a doctor?
Radiologist.

15:59.542 --> 16:01.710
Babe...
I'm still only a resident.

16:02.003 --> 16:05.255
- Lori, that is very impressive.
Hey, look, she's only 26.

16:05.465 --> 16:06.673
She's just a baby.

16:06.758 --> 16:08.842
- I'm just your baby.
- You're my baby.

16:09.135 --> 16:11.136
What are you doing, Scotty?

16:11.721 --> 16:13.889
God, when was
the last time that we spoke?

16:14.015 --> 16:16.058
- You were selling T-shirts in Philly,
- Oh.

16:16.184 --> 16:19.603
Then you kind of disappeared when I told
you I'd hook you up with a job out here.

16:19.729 --> 16:21.688
Right, Ari wanted me to come
out here and work for him,

16:21.773 --> 16:24.358
like I was still
his "little brother" back at the frat.

16:24.442 --> 16:27.819
- God, could this guy haze.
- I've heard some stories.

16:27.904 --> 16:29.905
- It's true.
- What are you doing now?

16:30.406 --> 16:32.741
Actually, Ari,
I don't do anything.

16:33.368 --> 16:35.494
I made a fortune
in stamps.

16:35.620 --> 16:37.746
What?

16:37.830 --> 16:39.831
What does that mean?
Stamps?

16:39.916 --> 16:41.291
Stamps-dot-com.

16:41.751 --> 16:43.710
Three little words
that saved my life...

16:43.795 --> 16:45.420
"stamps, dot, com. "

16:45.922 --> 16:47.881
Got in at the beginning,
sold out at the top.

16:47.965 --> 16:51.009
- Made $65 million.
- ARl: $65 million.

16:51.135 --> 16:53.428
- Fuck you.
- He's exaggerating.

16:53.763 --> 16:55.889
- Well, taxes.
- As usual you're right.

16:56.391 --> 16:59.476
It's more like
45, cash.

16:59.560 --> 17:00.852
- You know?
Give or take.

17:01.479 --> 17:04.690
- Fuck me.
- Scott, that is an amazing story.

17:04.773 --> 17:07.150
You know what? I always knew you would
find your way.

17:07.609 --> 17:09.653
Wow, you know that
means a lot to me.

17:09.820 --> 17:11.780
So hey,
how about a toast?

17:12.031 --> 17:13.699
To all of our success

17:13.782 --> 17:15.617
and to our most
beautiful women.

17:15.702 --> 17:18.036
- Oh, Scott, that is very sweet.
- Thank you.

17:18.204 --> 17:20.288
Ari, come on.
MRS. ARl: A hopeless romantic.

17:20.373 --> 17:22.165
- Hey... huh?
Ari, cheers. Pass the love over here.

17:22.666 --> 17:24.626
Chuck continues to tee up.
Oh, Chuck!

17:24.711 --> 17:26.294
Combinations,
uppercut...

17:26.378 --> 17:29.548
Oh, Jesus.
Sweet merciful Jesus.

17:29.924 --> 17:32.092
- Say something, Vince.
- What do I say, Johnny?

17:32.176 --> 17:35.053
I don't know. You always have
positive things to say.

17:35.138 --> 17:36.304
Tell me it's gonna be okay.

17:36.556 --> 17:38.014
Everything is gonna be okay.

17:38.099 --> 17:39.683
He's a mess.
- You think so?

17:39.809 --> 17:42.060
Vince usually knows what's gonna be okay
and what's not, right?

17:42.145 --> 17:43.895
...with a vicious
combination!

17:43.980 --> 17:46.231
Nasty. He found his range
at the end of the first round.

17:46.315 --> 17:49.151
- I'm a ghost.
- Turtle to the rescue again.

17:49.694 --> 17:52.446
- Please tell me something good.
- I just got off the phone with Hack.

17:52.780 --> 17:54.740
He's got a friend,
who's got a friend

17:54.824 --> 17:56.950
who trains with a Brazilian
in Liddell's crew.

17:57.034 --> 17:58.952
He scored us a couple of tickets
to this exhibition fight

17:59.036 --> 18:00.912
Liddell's doing tonight
down at the Music Box.

18:00.997 --> 18:03.457
So you want me to just deliver myself
to the lion's den?

18:03.583 --> 18:04.833
Would you relax, Drama?

18:04.917 --> 18:08.253
It's a benefit for Chuck's foundation...
"Liddell's Kids. "

18:08.838 --> 18:09.963
Is that like
"Jerry's Kids"?

18:10.673 --> 18:12.090
Not exactly.

18:12.175 --> 18:14.092
Liddell's kids are
all juvenile delinquents.

18:14.427 --> 18:16.470
He's working hard
to get them off the street.

18:16.554 --> 18:18.722
The Brazilian said
Chuck has a soft side,

18:18.806 --> 18:20.557
and when he sees you
come down there,

18:20.641 --> 18:23.226
support these kids
and apologize,

18:23.561 --> 18:25.228
he'll drop
the whole thing.

18:26.814 --> 18:28.023
And if he doesn't?

18:29.650 --> 18:30.734
Who knows?

18:30.818 --> 18:33.320
What's he really gonna do to you
in front of a room full of people?

18:34.655 --> 18:35.781
That.

18:35.865 --> 18:37.240
Unbelievable.

18:38.075 --> 18:39.326
That would suck.

18:40.203 --> 18:42.537
We should just tell them
to go to a hotel.

18:42.622 --> 18:46.374
- I mean, they can afford it.
- What a difference six hours makes.

18:46.667 --> 18:48.627
When I said that, you said,
"It's only one night. "

18:48.711 --> 18:50.253
"Shit, you could do that
in a Mexican jail

18:50.338 --> 18:52.964
and come out almost as clean as you went
in," I believe was the quote.

18:53.049 --> 18:55.967
When we were 25, it was funny when
he would say how hot you are.

18:56.052 --> 18:57.844
Now it's just annoying.

18:57.929 --> 19:00.764
No, when we were 25,
he'd say stuff like "Show me your tits,"

19:00.848 --> 19:03.016
or "If I hit this shot from half court
how 'bout a blow job?"

19:03.100 --> 19:04.643
And you'd laugh
your ass off.

19:04.727 --> 19:07.521
Now he's sort of complimentary
and it's kind of sweet.

19:07.605 --> 19:09.356
- No, it's kind of sickening.
- You know what I think?

19:09.440 --> 19:11.983
I think you like
Scott as a loser

19:12.068 --> 19:14.694
with no money and no girls,
and now he's got more money than you,

19:14.779 --> 19:16.404
and a younger girl,
and you're sort of threatened.

19:16.489 --> 19:18.198
- Threatened?
- Yes, threatened.

19:18.282 --> 19:19.866
And it's really immature, Ari.

19:19.951 --> 19:21.576
Oh, it's immature
that I don't like

19:21.661 --> 19:23.870
my adult friends speaking
to my wife like that?

19:23.955 --> 19:26.164
Well, obviously you do,
and he does,

19:26.249 --> 19:28.166
so why don't we see
how Scott likes it

19:28.251 --> 19:32.128
when I start drooling over the future
Mrs. Siegal's soon-to-be-Jewish ass?

19:48.563 --> 19:50.564
Don't look
defeated already, Drama.

19:50.690 --> 19:52.858
It's not about Liddell.
It's about the delinquents.

19:52.942 --> 19:54.609
I don't wanna make eye contact
with any of them.

19:54.694 --> 19:56.570
You scared of a bunch
of teenagers?

19:56.654 --> 19:59.364
Turtle, they can do whatever
they want and not get charged as adults.

19:59.448 --> 20:00.866
It's gonna be all right, Johnny.
I promise.

20:00.950 --> 20:02.242
I hope so.

20:02.535 --> 20:04.870
All right, I'm gonna hit the head, guys.
I'll see you in the seats.

20:04.954 --> 20:07.080
- You gonna be all right alone?
- Yeah, I'll be fine in the bathroom.

20:07.164 --> 20:08.540
I'll see you guys
at the seats.

20:08.708 --> 20:10.125
All right, see ya.

20:11.961 --> 20:15.255
With a vicious
combination!

20:17.550 --> 20:18.967
Is this the line
for the bathroom?

20:19.051 --> 20:20.385
What's the sign say?

20:25.975 --> 20:26.975
Hello?

20:27.435 --> 20:30.604
Hey, I just got off
with the People's Choice people again,

20:30.688 --> 20:32.564
and apparently,
the people have spoken,

20:32.648 --> 20:34.232
and Vince is their choice.

20:34.400 --> 20:37.277
- For what?
- "Favorite Male Star of Tomorrow. "

20:37.862 --> 20:39.863
Now, it's gonna be kind of hard
to say no to him presenting,

20:39.947 --> 20:42.198
since he'll already be there accepting.
You on board?

20:42.283 --> 20:43.658
Sure, I'll tell him.

20:44.160 --> 20:47.037
I know it's no Oscar,
but it is from the people.

20:47.121 --> 20:48.413
It's fine, Amanda.
Really.

20:48.497 --> 20:51.166
- Then why am I sensing attitude?
- We're cutting you.

20:52.376 --> 20:54.586
- Hello?
- I'm not giving you any attitude.

20:54.670 --> 20:56.922
Okay, now I know
I'm getting attitude.

20:57.006 --> 20:58.757
- Wanna talk about it, E?
- Nope.

20:59.759 --> 21:00.842
Ah...

21:01.385 --> 21:03.428
it sounds like you boys
have been gossiping.

21:03.596 --> 21:05.305
Yeah, well he didn't say anything,
if that's what matters.

21:05.389 --> 21:06.473
It was obvious.

21:07.224 --> 21:10.352
I guess maybe it was.
So what now?

21:10.853 --> 21:12.270
You wanna get something
off your chest?

21:12.355 --> 21:15.106
Yeah. I do. You call me into
your office yesterday

21:15.191 --> 21:16.483
to tell me that I'm being
unprofessional,

21:16.567 --> 21:18.568
and then you go and do this?
I mean, is that even legal?

21:19.862 --> 21:21.738
I'm his agent,
not his shrink.

21:21.822 --> 21:23.782
Yeah, well I'm gonna have to be his
shrink on this one, okay?

21:23.866 --> 21:26.159
'Cause Vince has a hard time
separating business and sex.

21:26.243 --> 21:28.828
Guy almost threw away a $100 million
movie last year over Mandy Moore.

21:28.913 --> 21:30.121
I can't let that happen again.

21:30.206 --> 21:33.541
Eric, I love that you care about Vince,
but I'm a grown woman.

21:33.668 --> 21:36.169
I'm not confused about what I want.
I don't play games.

21:36.295 --> 21:38.755
And I don't risk my career or the career
of my clients on a whim.

21:39.757 --> 21:41.591
I really like Vince.

21:42.343 --> 21:43.677
It's as simple as that.

21:45.346 --> 21:47.931
Scott, this steak
is terrific.

21:48.015 --> 21:49.224
Glatt kosher.

21:49.392 --> 21:51.476
Yeah, we passed
by a butcher on Fairfax,

21:51.560 --> 21:54.354
- said we had to get it for you guys.
- We're not kosher, Scott.

21:54.438 --> 21:57.107
- Well, it was still thoughtful.
- It's good clean meat.

21:57.191 --> 21:58.400
- Glatt, right?
- MRS. ARl: Mm-hmm.

21:58.484 --> 22:01.528
Oh, and lean. Not that you need
to worry about that.

22:03.447 --> 22:05.407
I'm surprised
you eat red meat, Lori.

22:05.950 --> 22:07.659
- Why?
- I mean, with a body like that...

22:07.743 --> 22:10.036
So tell us about
the honeymoon.

22:10.997 --> 22:14.457
Well, it's gonna be amazing.

22:14.542 --> 22:16.960
- Amazing like that body.
- 27 days, you say?

22:17.086 --> 22:20.380
- Yeah, yeah. Just the two of us.
And the captain.

22:20.464 --> 22:22.257
I thought about taking sailing lessons

22:22.341 --> 22:24.092
so we could be alone
the whole time, but...

22:25.428 --> 22:27.846
Sounds amazing.
Truly amazing.

22:27.930 --> 22:29.723
What, our honeymoon sucked?
Come on.

22:29.807 --> 22:31.850
No. And our honeymoon
was amazing also, Ari.

22:31.934 --> 22:33.852
Well, we only made it to Hawaii.
Didn't have any money

22:33.936 --> 22:35.895
like most people don't
when they get married.

22:35.980 --> 22:38.398
Look, I'm sure wherever
you went with this beautiful woman

22:38.482 --> 22:41.818
- was absolutely heavenly.
- Thank you, Scott.

22:43.863 --> 22:46.406
Just as I'm sure wherever
you go with this little hottie

22:46.574 --> 22:48.700
will be more than amazing.
Fuck, it'll be orgasmic.

22:49.910 --> 22:51.369
I mean, I'm sorry,
I don't mean to be rude,

22:51.454 --> 22:54.789
but ever since you got here, I have not
been able to take my eyes off your ass.

22:55.124 --> 22:57.417
I mean, it's
the perfect shape.

22:57.585 --> 22:59.711
It's like God came down,

23:00.046 --> 23:03.173
hand-crafted it,
put it on a little silver tray,

23:03.257 --> 23:06.009
and hand-delivered it
to my man, Scotty.

23:06.385 --> 23:08.511
Bravo, Scotty boy!

23:08.596 --> 23:11.222
Bravo!
I'm gonna get some scotch.

23:13.476 --> 23:15.518
I am so sorry.

23:18.939 --> 23:20.732
MRS. ARl: Ari!

23:21.192 --> 23:22.984
What the fuck
is wrong with you?

23:23.069 --> 23:24.819
- What, too much?
- Just a little.

23:25.613 --> 23:26.863
Payback's a bitch.

23:26.947 --> 23:28.782
I cannot believe
how jealous you are of him.

23:28.866 --> 23:31.326
- It is ridiculous.
- He won the lottery...

23:31.410 --> 23:33.745
stamps. Com,
are you kidding me?

23:33.829 --> 23:36.539
What don't you have, Ari?

23:36.832 --> 23:40.251
- I'm sorry, is this not enough for you?
- It's enough for me,

23:40.336 --> 23:42.587
but I'm starting to feel that maybe
it's not enough for you.

23:43.631 --> 23:45.423
You're right, Ari.
It's not enough for me.

23:45.674 --> 23:47.175
That's why I stuck it out
with you this long,

23:47.301 --> 23:49.094
in the hopes that your college friend
who nauseated me

23:49.178 --> 23:52.013
would make $65 million
and come back and rescue me from you.

23:53.641 --> 23:55.183
I'm detecting sarcasm.

23:55.392 --> 23:57.060
You're detecting
a lot of sarcasm.

23:58.938 --> 24:01.439
This is more
than enough for me.

24:01.649 --> 24:04.859
You, Ari, are more than
enough for me.

24:05.861 --> 24:07.070
Come here.

24:07.154 --> 24:08.154
Oh, oh.

24:11.826 --> 24:14.035
Ahem... listen, Ari,

24:14.161 --> 24:15.495
I know you were
kidding out there,

24:15.579 --> 24:17.247
but Lori doesn't
get frat humor,

24:17.581 --> 24:19.457
so she's outside
getting a cab.

24:19.583 --> 24:22.127
I'm gonna grab the bags,
and we're gonna go to a hotel.

24:22.211 --> 24:24.671
But listen, I'll be back in
a couple of months,

24:24.755 --> 24:28.383
and we'll grab a steak and a couple of
dancers over at the Rhino, all right?

24:28.551 --> 24:30.301
Sorry.
Take care.

24:30.761 --> 24:31.928
Should we try
to stop them?

24:32.012 --> 24:34.597
No, the kids
are at your mom's.

24:34.765 --> 24:37.058
- Let's burn the house to the ground.
- Okay.

24:46.485 --> 24:49.737
- Come on, Chuck! Choke him out!
- Easy, Drama.

24:49.822 --> 24:52.073
It's an exhibition fight.
There ain't no way he's losing.

24:52.199 --> 24:54.492
Which is good, because he'll definitely
be happier than if he lost.

24:54.577 --> 24:57.120
Yeah, exactly. And if my cheering has
anything to do with it,

24:57.204 --> 24:58.496
I will not be silenced.

24:58.581 --> 25:00.748
Come on, Chuck!
Finish the punk off!

25:00.875 --> 25:03.585
Yeah! Oh!

25:09.133 --> 25:11.342
Yeah!
Yeah, Champ!

25:11.427 --> 25:13.428
Yeah, Champ!
Yeah!

25:14.972 --> 25:16.431
Yeah, Champ!

25:17.600 --> 25:20.602
You? What are you
doing here?

25:21.645 --> 25:23.354
Chuck, Chuck.

25:23.647 --> 25:25.356
Masterful fight,
my friend.

25:25.441 --> 25:27.650
- Congratulations.
- Get in the ring, Chase.

25:30.070 --> 25:31.779
That won't be
necessary, Chuck.

25:32.031 --> 25:33.823
I merely came
to apologize.

25:34.408 --> 25:37.452
And to contribute to this
most important charity.

25:37.703 --> 25:40.079
As a troubled youth myself,
I could only have dreamed

25:40.164 --> 25:42.540
of having a role model
like you to keep me off the streets.

25:42.625 --> 25:44.500
Quit your ass-kissing,
and get in the ring.

25:44.627 --> 25:46.127
Or do I need to come
out there and get you?

25:47.379 --> 25:49.881
- Where's the nearest exit?
- Not near enough, Drama.

25:49.965 --> 25:51.966
We're waiting, John.

25:52.801 --> 25:55.261
- Vince?
- What can I do, Johnny?

25:55.429 --> 25:56.888
Nothing, bro'.

25:56.972 --> 26:00.183
You've done enough.
I love you.

26:12.112 --> 26:13.613
Friends,

26:14.448 --> 26:16.449
this guy took
my parking spot today.

26:17.785 --> 26:21.829
Then he told me to "F" myself
in front of my baby girl.

26:24.667 --> 26:26.584
So kids, kids,

26:26.794 --> 26:29.796
this is the kind of guy
you don't wanna be.

26:30.172 --> 26:31.297
This guy's a punk.

26:32.675 --> 26:34.008
And what do
we do with punks?

26:34.218 --> 26:36.010
Take him down!

26:37.137 --> 26:38.846
Put him down!

26:38.973 --> 26:41.349
That's right.
We take them down.

26:42.351 --> 26:43.685
But not in the streets.

26:44.019 --> 26:46.020
Here in the Octagon.

26:46.105 --> 26:48.189
Kick his ass!

26:50.025 --> 26:52.443
It was a mistake, Chuck.
I swear.

26:52.653 --> 26:54.946
It was just
a giant misunderstanding.

26:55.030 --> 26:58.074
I thought it was this stupid-ass hidden
camera show called "Gotcha. "

26:58.325 --> 26:59.575
I should have known better.

27:00.369 --> 27:02.996
Chuck, I would
never disrespect you.

27:03.497 --> 27:04.789
So please...

27:05.291 --> 27:07.834
...accept this sincere apology.

27:08.544 --> 27:11.546
Johnny, get down on your knees
and beg for forgiveness,

27:12.047 --> 27:14.465
- and I might show you mercy.
Do it!

27:14.550 --> 27:17.135
Yeah, get down on your knees.

27:17.219 --> 27:19.846
- Please, Chuck...
- Look, John, you got two choices...

27:20.097 --> 27:22.890
either you get down
or we throw down.

27:42.786 --> 27:44.037
Pussy!

27:47.916 --> 27:49.334
"Gotcha," John.

27:50.377 --> 27:51.419
Huh?

27:52.254 --> 27:54.130
Got you,
you son of a bitch!

27:54.715 --> 27:56.674
You got got!

27:57.301 --> 28:00.261
Yeah, you got got!

28:00.763 --> 28:03.348
You got got!

28:03.515 --> 28:06.225
You got got!
You got got! You got got!

28:06.310 --> 28:12.190
You got got!
You got got!

28:12.274 --> 28:14.192
Sorry, I hope you're
a good sport, bro'.

28:14.610 --> 28:17.195
Fuck it.
Two pilots in one season.

28:17.279 --> 28:19.447
Yeah! Yeah!

28:21.992 --> 28:23.159
You got got!

28:23.243 --> 28:25.661
You got got, baby!

28:27.414 --> 28:28.998
You asked for it.

28:29.249 --> 28:31.959
You got got!

28:32.044 --> 28:33.711
- You missed it.
- It's all good, E.

28:33.796 --> 28:36.130
Pauly's gonna hook us up with
the footage so we can relive the agony

28:36.215 --> 28:38.216
- of defeat over and over again.
- Nice.

28:38.300 --> 28:41.010
- Where were you?
- I was on the phone with Amanda.

28:41.095 --> 28:43.096
Tell me you didn't
say something stupid.

28:43.263 --> 28:44.680
Come on, E,
you promised.

28:44.765 --> 28:46.474
Yeah, and you told me you were
with "jewelry store girl. "

28:46.600 --> 28:47.975
Looks like we're both liars.

28:48.143 --> 28:50.478
All right, whatever.
It's no big deal.

28:50.729 --> 28:52.647
I told you it was
a one-time thing.

28:52.856 --> 28:54.565
I'm not sure she sees
it that way, Vince.

28:54.650 --> 28:56.859
She said she really
likes you.

28:56.985 --> 28:58.569
Really?
She said that?

28:59.446 --> 29:01.197
Yeah, she said that.
What are you smiling about?

29:01.323 --> 29:02.698
I don't know,

29:03.158 --> 29:05.493
because I think
I like her too.
