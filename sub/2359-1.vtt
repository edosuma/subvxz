This is Radio Anthem UK.

00:13.920 --> 00:18.100
MPs have rushed a ban on land
mines in just five hours.

00:18.200 --> 00:22.060
Former secretary Robin Cook says
it will be a tribute to Princess Diana

00:22.160 --> 00:23.864
before the anniversary of her death.

00:24.160 --> 00:25.220
And the weather:

00:25.320 --> 00:28.140
There will be a few showers
in the north tonight, some heavy.

00:28.240 --> 00:30.661
Overnight lows
down to about nine degrees.

00:30.840 --> 00:34.069
Tomorrow, a bit of sunshine
in the north, with some showers.

00:34.200 --> 00:37.224

Sorry, we're closed.

01:09.880 --> 01:12.381
My name's Macy.
This is my daughter, Noni.

01:13.080 --> 01:15.820
I'm Felicia. It's nice to meet you.

01:15.920 --> 01:18.660
I'm off tomorrow, but I can
probably get her in on Monday.

01:18.760 --> 01:21.860
- Oh, no, that's not gonna work.
- Well, babe, it's gonna have to.

01:21.960 --> 01:24.188
It's my birthday.
I've got plans with my man.

01:25.200 --> 01:26.347
Happy birthday.

01:28.040 --> 01:29.780
Thank you.

01:29.880 --> 01:31.780
She's singing in
a talent contest tomorrow

01:31.880 --> 01:34.100
and I don't know what the bloody hell
to do with her hair.

01:34.200 --> 01:37.429
- Grandma? Aunties?
- No, it's just me.

01:38.280 --> 01:41.827
Can you just... just show me something
really quickly, please?

01:43.720 --> 01:45.390
What are you singing?

01:46.240 --> 01:48.786
- "Blackbird."
- Nina Simone?

01:52.680 --> 01:55.140
It's going to be a fast lesson.

01:55.240 --> 01:56.262
Take a seat, pretty girl.

01:58.200 --> 02:01.220
Oh, my goodness! You didn't even
get the comb all the way through.

02:01.320 --> 02:02.700
Well, I can't get the comb through it.

02:02.800 --> 02:03.940
OK, OK.

02:24.600 --> 02:27.860
<i>Why you wanna fly</i>

02:27.960 --> 02:31.060
<i>Blackbird?</i>

02:31.160 --> 02:35.460
<i>You ain't ever gonna fly</i>

02:35.560 --> 02:38.940
<i>Why you wanna fly</i>

02:39.040 --> 02:42.220
<i>Blackbird?</i>

02:42.320 --> 02:47.060
<i>You ain't ever gonna fly</i>

02:47.160 --> 02:51.740
<i>No place big enough for holding</i>

02:51.840 --> 02:56.180
<i>All the tears you're gonna cry</i>

02:56.280 --> 03:00.740
<i>'Cause your mama's name was lonely</i>

03:00.840 --> 03:05.780
<i>And your daddy's name's pain</i>

03:05.880 --> 03:10.660
<i>And they call you little sorrow</i>

03:10.760 --> 03:14.831
<i>'Cause you'll never love again</i>

03:15.680 --> 03:21.300
- <i>You ain't got no one to hold you</i>
- Oh, you did so good.

03:21.400 --> 03:25.620
- <i>You ain't got no one to care</i>
- You were so good.

03:25.720 --> 03:28.700
- The second runner up...
- <i>If you'd only understand, dear</i>

03:28.800 --> 03:31.100
...Erica Johnston.

03:31.200 --> 03:35.380
- <i>Nobody wants you anywhere</i>
- Congratulations. Well done.

03:35.480 --> 03:40.060
- The first runner up is...
- <i>So why you wanna fly, Blackbird?</i>

03:40.160 --> 03:42.260
...Noni Jean! Noni!

03:42.360 --> 03:47.020
<i>You ain't ever gonna fly</i>

03:47.120 --> 03:52.340
- Good job.
- <i>Why you wanna fly, Blackbird?</i>

03:52.440 --> 03:57.580
- This year's contest winner:
- <i>You ain't ever gonna fly</i>

03:57.680 --> 04:00.380
Little Tammy Toulson!

04:03.880 --> 04:05.220
Come on, now.

04:10.080 --> 04:11.260
Well...

04:11.360 --> 04:14.862
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you all
for coming. Thank you, of course...

04:15.120 --> 04:17.820
Girl was a rhythmless idiot.

04:17.920 --> 04:19.339
See her counting steps?

04:19.440 --> 04:23.260
Bloody hell. Bloody, bloody
hula-hooping. It's bullshit!

04:23.360 --> 04:26.543
It is bullshit! It's bullshit!

04:42.880 --> 04:44.470
Chuck it.

04:45.080 --> 04:46.980
Go on, throw it away.

04:47.080 --> 04:48.420
Why, Mommy?

04:48.520 --> 04:52.147
You wanna be a runner-up,
or you wanna be a winner?

06:42.560 --> 06:45.220
They just showed your clip.

06:45.320 --> 06:46.860
I'm gonna get you to the spot.

06:46.960 --> 06:48.020
Love the hair.

06:48.120 --> 06:51.060
You guys are supposed to return back
to your seats after your performance.

06:52.160 --> 06:54.009
This way, this way.

06:56.720 --> 07:00.120
Imperial Mammoth,
"Last One to Leave the Party."

07:00.620 --> 07:02.060
OK, I'm gonna need everyone

07:02.160 --> 07:04.380
to clear out of this area.
I need everyone out of here.

07:04.480 --> 07:05.780
Just a minute.

07:05.880 --> 07:07.823
Excuse me. Arms up.

07:11.520 --> 07:13.060
- Please...
- Hold on.

07:13.160 --> 07:16.582
And the Billboard Award
for top song goes to...

07:18.680 --> 07:21.540
Kid Culprit and Noni, "Masterpiece."

07:26.520 --> 07:29.500
This is Kid Culprit's
third Billboard Award,

07:29.600 --> 07:31.623
and Noni's first win.

07:33.720 --> 07:35.584
Yeah!

07:37.280 --> 07:40.700
- Yo, Drake, can you grab the car?
- All right.

07:40.800 --> 07:42.260
What up, baby? You good?

07:42.360 --> 07:45.540
- You need to come to Miami with me.
- I've got a ton of press.

07:45.640 --> 07:47.900
You know I'm gonna get us
in some trouble down there.

07:48.000 --> 07:49.660
And a meeting with the label.

07:49.760 --> 07:52.620
Baby, you just won a Billboard
before your first album even dropped.

07:52.720 --> 07:55.380
Hey, they need to be
kissing your ass, for real.

07:55.480 --> 07:58.660
Here you go.
I'll be back for the concert.

07:58.760 --> 08:00.703
Just keep it tight for me, all right?

08:04.040 --> 08:06.260
- There's Noni, there's Kid!
- Kid!

08:06.360 --> 08:09.060
Right, I've got a meeting with Bradley,
so I'll be right behind you.

08:09.160 --> 08:11.420
Can you get down the stairs, please?

08:15.320 --> 08:17.100
Noni, I love you!

08:17.200 --> 08:18.540
Kid!

08:18.640 --> 08:20.300
- Noni!
- Yeah!

08:20.400 --> 08:22.700
- Noni, I love you!
- I want your autograph please.

08:22.800 --> 08:25.500
Oh, my God! I love you, Noni!

08:25.600 --> 08:28.749
Oh, my... Oh, my God!

08:47.240 --> 08:48.780
She scared me.

08:48.880 --> 08:51.790
These kids are turned up, yo.

08:54.520 --> 08:56.540
Our girl's imbibing?

08:56.640 --> 08:59.823
What? Ooh, I'm taking a pic.

09:09.760 --> 09:11.780
- Noni!
- Noni!

09:11.880 --> 09:15.300
Noni! Do you want this?

09:15.400 --> 09:17.060
Noni! Looking good, Noni.

09:17.160 --> 09:20.500
Noni, over here!
You look beautiful, baby! Right here.

09:20.600 --> 09:24.830
- Oh, my God. Wow.
- Oh, my God, it's Noni!

09:28.960 --> 09:30.869
She's so pretty.

09:38.640 --> 09:40.760
Unbelievable.

09:41.520 --> 09:43.500
You have the worse taste
in men I've ever seen.

09:43.600 --> 09:46.820
- See, that's not true.
- Yeah, you do. You do.

09:46.920 --> 09:48.740
- I've seen... Ooh.
- Whoa. You OK?

09:48.840 --> 09:50.180
Drunk.

09:51.480 --> 09:52.860
Congratulations.

09:52.960 --> 09:55.380
No one walks in after me, OK?

09:55.480 --> 09:56.661
Yes, ma'am.

10:01.000 --> 10:03.660
- Noni.
- I just need a minute.

10:03.760 --> 10:06.101
We actually need to go in there.

10:07.200 --> 10:09.820
She didn't mean us.
She meant everyone else.

10:09.920 --> 10:11.460
- We're in a rush, Officer.
- Seriously.

10:11.560 --> 10:13.780
What's going on? Why aren't you getting
her changed? You've got after-parties.

10:13.880 --> 10:16.870
Noni won't let us in the room, and the
cop here thinks he's the bodyguard.

10:19.040 --> 10:21.950
Go and get something to eat.
Come back in 30.

10:22.680 --> 10:24.111
Can you let me in, please?

10:33.600 --> 10:34.906
Have a great night, ma'am.

10:36.120 --> 10:38.300
Noni?

10:38.400 --> 10:39.700
Noni! Oh, my God!

10:39.800 --> 10:42.062
None, what are you doing?

10:43.520 --> 10:45.220
Don't.

10:45.320 --> 10:46.706
Ma'am, I need you to stand back.

10:48.240 --> 10:51.071
It's very important
you stand right here, OK?

11:01.440 --> 11:02.780
Noni?

11:05.040 --> 11:06.904
What's going on?

11:19.360 --> 11:22.942
Can you look at me for a second? Please?

11:26.960 --> 11:29.028
Please?

11:33.320 --> 11:36.230
You still can't see me.

11:40.760 --> 11:41.941
No!

11:44.420 --> 11:45.984
No!

11:48.320 --> 11:50.180
Grab my hand.

11:50.280 --> 11:51.825
Grab my hand.

11:52.960 --> 11:56.906
Hey! Hey, hey, hey! Look at me, damn it.
Look at me! Listen to me! Hey!

11:57.720 --> 11:59.860
Shit, Noni. Listen to me, listen to me.
Look at me.

11:59.960 --> 12:02.108
I see you.

12:05.040 --> 12:06.710
I see you.

12:44.040 --> 12:48.100
Nones? None, come on.

12:48.200 --> 12:49.620
Come on.

12:49.720 --> 12:51.780
Come on, babe, let's go inside. Come on.

12:51.880 --> 12:55.507
Come on.

12:59.040 --> 13:02.269
Let's go inside. Come on.

13:05.600 --> 13:06.701
Come on, honey.

13:48.160 --> 13:49.740
Supposed to be easy money,

13:49.840 --> 13:52.068
babysitting these celebrities.

13:53.080 --> 13:55.060
First time, too, right?

13:55.160 --> 13:58.660
Jesse asked me to cover for him.
Anniversary.

13:58.760 --> 14:01.900
You think I can talk to her
for a minute? Her mom's blocking...

14:02.000 --> 14:05.740
Hey, wait a minute.
You get this looked at?

14:05.840 --> 14:07.460
I'm fine, Pop.

14:07.560 --> 14:11.140
Just need to see her, you know?
Check on her.

14:11.240 --> 14:14.140
There's gonna be a press conference
in about 30 minutes.

14:14.240 --> 14:16.340
She wants to publicly thank you.

14:16.440 --> 14:18.940
She needs to be in a hospital,
not in front of cameras.

14:19.040 --> 14:24.226
She's OK. She just had a little
too much to drink and she slipped.

14:24.800 --> 14:25.860
What?

14:25.960 --> 14:29.140
Look, son,
that doesn't change what you did.

14:29.240 --> 14:33.140
And they are very... grateful.

14:36.160 --> 14:37.500
You're telling me to lie?

14:37.600 --> 14:40.540
She's written her script.

14:40.640 --> 14:43.060
She's playing her part.

14:43.160 --> 14:45.422
And so will you.

14:48.920 --> 14:51.900
I was celebrating and things
got a little out of hand.

14:52.000 --> 14:54.460
So, let this be a lesson to all of you.

14:54.560 --> 14:57.500
Never mix champagne, a balcony
and five-inch stilettos.

14:58.960 --> 15:02.580
How does a person fall off a balcony
with a four and a half foot railing?

15:02.680 --> 15:04.460
Yeah, she's just here
to make a statement...

15:04.560 --> 15:06.860
Officer Nicol,
was this a suicide attempt?

15:06.960 --> 15:08.740
Steve, you're not gonna hijack
this press conference

15:08.840 --> 15:10.620
with your tabloid bullshit, all right?

15:10.720 --> 15:12.020
He can't answer a simple question?

15:12.120 --> 15:13.980
Answer the question.

15:14.080 --> 15:16.300
- Just answer the question.
- He was there.

15:16.400 --> 15:18.184
People would want to know.

15:25.160 --> 15:26.660
I was summoned into the hotel room

15:26.760 --> 15:29.261
where I found Miss Jean
holding on to the balcony railing.

15:30.920 --> 15:34.860
As I pulled her to safety,
it was clear she was inebriated.

15:34.960 --> 15:36.860
- Thank you.
- Truth is,

15:36.960 --> 15:39.540
I wouldn't be standing here
if it wasn't for Officer Nicol.

15:39.640 --> 15:41.868
He pulled me up.

15:42.040 --> 15:45.020
Even with all this... extra.

15:45.120 --> 15:48.020
- Thank you.
- You saying you almost died?

15:55.480 --> 15:57.180
She's not out of control.

15:57.280 --> 16:00.620
She won a Billboard Award tonight
and she was celebrating...

16:06.840 --> 16:10.626
So, Officer, what are you gonna do
with your 15 minutes?

16:11.960 --> 16:14.500
- Excuse me?
- Of fame.

16:14.600 --> 16:17.700
I bet you're gonna pull a lot of chicks
with this whole sexy, hero cop thing.

16:17.800 --> 16:20.220
Don't do that.

16:20.320 --> 16:22.380
Two hours ago,
you were trying to drop 12 floors.

16:22.480 --> 16:24.867
And you were screaming, "I see you."

16:26.000 --> 16:29.309
So... just what do you see?

16:31.520 --> 16:33.110
Nothing.

16:36.480 --> 16:39.470
OK. All right?

16:40.840 --> 16:42.351
Thanks very much.

16:47.920 --> 16:50.261
Can you make me understand, Noni?

16:51.360 --> 16:54.350
- I told you, I was drunk.
- You don't drink.

16:55.080 --> 16:57.308
Now we know why.

16:59.120 --> 17:02.420
Is this some...
some sort of cry for help?

17:02.520 --> 17:05.540
- No.
- Good. 'Cause look around you.

17:05.640 --> 17:08.380
- You ain't got nothing to cry about.
- I know. It was stupid.

17:08.480 --> 17:11.151
You can't afford to be stupid!

17:21.240 --> 17:23.741
You just tell me it was a mistake.

17:26.480 --> 17:28.180
It was a mistake.

17:28.280 --> 17:30.621
Promise me it'll never happen again.

17:31.880 --> 17:34.260
OK.

17:34.360 --> 17:37.270
I want to hear you say it.

17:38.240 --> 17:42.345
I promise, it will never happen again.

18:03.080 --> 18:04.780
Yeah, that's our guy.

18:04.880 --> 18:08.020
- Try and get a quote.
- Officer Nicol?

18:08.120 --> 18:09.620
- Officer Nicol, over here?
- One shot, please?

18:09.720 --> 18:11.700
This way, sir.

18:11.800 --> 18:13.660
Officer Nicol?

18:13.760 --> 18:15.260
Steve Sams with the National Enquirer.

18:15.360 --> 18:16.820
You're trespassing.

18:16.920 --> 18:18.820
I already said everything I have to say.

18:18.920 --> 18:20.620
I'll pay you 20,000 off the record.

18:20.720 --> 18:23.140
Fifty for an exclusive.

18:23.240 --> 18:26.180
You hit the lottery, man.
No shame in that.

18:26.280 --> 18:29.580
The offer is good
until the truth comes out.

18:29.680 --> 18:31.669
And it always comes out.

18:43.440 --> 18:45.144
Hey.

18:46.000 --> 18:48.870
Yup, yup, yup, yup.

19:00.760 --> 19:04.540
You have 37 new messages.
First new message:

19:04.640 --> 19:07.660
Hi, this is Nina Grimes-Stuart. I'm a
producer with Entertainment Tonight.

19:07.760 --> 19:09.900
I'm trying to reach Officer Nicol.

19:10.000 --> 19:12.980
We're doing a piece on Noni and what
happened to her earlier this evening.

19:13.080 --> 19:14.780
Next message.

19:14.880 --> 19:16.180
This is Emery Holmes with the LA Times.

19:18.160 --> 19:20.420
One of us didn't show up...

19:20.520 --> 19:21.620
The number one...

19:21.720 --> 19:25.260
She's on a roll with three number
one hits with rapper Kid Culprit,

19:25.360 --> 19:27.660
and a Billboard Award
tonight for top song.

19:27.760 --> 19:30.660
But is Noni a casualty
of her own success?

19:30.760 --> 19:31.860
Earlier this evening,

19:31.960 --> 19:35.020
witnesses report she was hanging
off the balcony of her luxury suite

19:35.120 --> 19:37.222
at the Sofitel Hotel in Beverly Hills.

19:37.600 --> 19:39.620
Following the incident,
Noni made a statement

19:39.720 --> 19:41.780
at a press conference at the hotel.

19:41.880 --> 19:44.940
I was celebrating and things
got a little out of hand.

19:45.040 --> 19:47.220
So, let this be a lesson to all of you.

19:47.320 --> 19:50.220
Never mix champagne,
a balcony and five-inch stilettos.

20:28.480 --> 20:33.580
Excessive drinking is no joke and I just
wanna apologize to all my young fans.

20:33.680 --> 20:34.940
I hear you,
and they're listening to you.

20:35.040 --> 20:37.540
So, how are things otherwise?
You're a Billboard winner.

20:37.640 --> 20:39.460
- I know, right?
- Right.

20:39.560 --> 20:42.380
My first album drops in a couple
of weeks, and it's bananas.

20:42.480 --> 20:43.940
I can't wait for the world to hear it.

20:44.040 --> 20:47.420
And rumor has it that it could be
the biggest debut by a female artist,

20:47.520 --> 20:50.620
even with the decline of album sales.

20:50.720 --> 20:55.269
You know, that would be amazing,
but really, I just wanna sing.

20:55.600 --> 20:57.660
Well, good luck with everything.
Very scary stuff.

20:57.760 --> 20:59.860
We're glad it all turned out OK for you.

20:59.960 --> 21:02.180
- Thanks.
- And we're clear.

21:02.280 --> 21:03.950
Great.

21:09.920 --> 21:13.340
- Have you seen the hashtags?
- Oh, yeah, stay off Twitter.

21:13.440 --> 21:16.220
Just wanna push mainstream media
and stay out in front of that.

21:16.320 --> 21:18.380
Right, we've got Ellen in 45 minutes.

21:19.880 --> 21:22.445
Hello? Yeah.

21:24.280 --> 21:25.980
No, I mean, if you...

21:26.080 --> 21:27.620
If you just do what I told you...

21:27.720 --> 21:30.020
No. No.

21:30.120 --> 21:32.420
You're making it seem like
I'm asking you to split the atom.

21:32.520 --> 21:34.620
Just don't use that word.

21:34.720 --> 21:36.380
What'd they offer you?

21:36.480 --> 21:39.180
- What do you mean?
- Autographed picture? Porsche?

21:39.280 --> 21:41.940
Whatever it is, I get half,
seeing how it is my gig.

21:42.040 --> 21:43.900
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Wait a minute. Turn around.

21:44.000 --> 21:46.020
Come on, take a picture.
Come on, smile for the camera.

21:46.120 --> 21:47.820
There we go.

21:47.920 --> 21:50.380
Hey, come on, guys.
Let's show a little respect.

21:50.480 --> 21:52.100
- Thank you. Thank you.
- All right.

21:52.200 --> 21:54.520
Hey! Whoa!

21:55.320 --> 21:57.340
Come on, don't you like that?

21:57.440 --> 21:59.020
- This is you?
- Man...

21:59.120 --> 22:02.100
- You know.
- OK, OK, enough. Thank you.

22:02.200 --> 22:04.700
How did you do that?

22:14.720 --> 22:16.020
Hello, ladies.

22:16.120 --> 22:17.790
Liam, we've been waiting for 40 minutes.

22:18.760 --> 22:20.140
I apologize.

22:20.240 --> 22:22.460
This is supposed to be
a strategy meeting. Where's everyone?

22:22.560 --> 22:24.620
We're holding off
on releasing the album.

22:24.720 --> 22:26.260
- What?
- Why?

22:26.360 --> 22:28.740
I didn't snow you,
so don't snow me, all right?

22:28.840 --> 22:31.100
She got drunk. She did something stupid.

22:31.200 --> 22:33.420
So did Britney, so did Kanye.
You want me to give you a list?

22:33.520 --> 22:35.140
The blogs are all saying
"suicide attempt."

22:35.240 --> 22:37.940
- Of course they are. So?
- So?

22:38.040 --> 22:42.060
Noni is supposed to be the girl
that every guy wants,

22:42.160 --> 22:43.860
and every girl wants to be.

22:43.960 --> 22:47.340
We're selling fantasy here,
and suicide ain't sexy.

22:47.440 --> 22:49.100
No, this is ridiculous. Where's Trey?

22:49.200 --> 22:52.180
- He's in New York.
- She put this bloody label in the game,

22:52.280 --> 22:55.340
- and this is how it's gonna treat her?
- We... put her on Kid Culprit's

22:55.440 --> 22:57.700
- three number one records.
- Saying I had nothing to do with that?

22:57.800 --> 22:59.500
Macy, you are her mother.

22:59.600 --> 23:03.102
That is the single qualification
you have for sitting in this room.

23:08.480 --> 23:11.460
Trey gave Noni a million dollar
signing bonus.

23:11.560 --> 23:16.300
You add to that the cost of recording,
mixing, mastering, marketing, promotion,

23:16.400 --> 23:17.580
he's in it for about two mil.

23:17.680 --> 23:21.980
He's not gonna see any of that money
back without album sales.

23:22.080 --> 23:25.020
In a couple of weeks,
she's performing at the BET Awards

23:25.120 --> 23:27.220
and millions of eyes
are gonna be on her.

23:27.320 --> 23:29.500
And I'm telling you,
by the end of that night,

23:29.600 --> 23:32.067
no one's gonna be
talking about a balcony.

23:32.240 --> 23:35.230
- So you say.
- Oh, no, I guarantee it.

23:36.200 --> 23:38.580
Her album's gonna break records.

23:38.680 --> 23:40.145
You know that.

23:41.520 --> 23:43.620
Be the hero.

23:43.720 --> 23:45.709
Tell Trey to keep the release date.

23:50.320 --> 23:52.540
If she doesn't kick ass at that show,

23:52.640 --> 23:55.580
if she doesn't change this conversation,

23:55.680 --> 23:58.511
I will personally drop her
from this label.

24:01.000 --> 24:03.460
It's the lead story
at every local affiliate.

24:03.560 --> 24:06.220
Top of the hour broadcast,
at a national level.

24:06.320 --> 24:09.540
Plus, it's gone viral online.
That's 100 percent saturation.

24:09.640 --> 24:11.420
So how do we build on this?

24:11.520 --> 24:14.940
Councilwoman Russell is going before
the grand jury in a couple of weeks.

24:15.040 --> 24:17.500
Word in the room is
she will be indicted.

24:17.600 --> 24:19.340
And when that happens,
we go after her seat.

24:19.440 --> 24:21.540
Isn't all this a couple of years
ahead of schedule?

24:21.640 --> 24:23.185
Opportunity can't tell time.

24:23.360 --> 24:25.420
Politics wants fresh faces.

24:25.520 --> 24:29.540
They're looking for stars,
and you, Kaz, are a star.

24:29.640 --> 24:31.580
You could do some big things.

24:31.680 --> 24:33.220
A lot bigger than your old man.

24:33.320 --> 24:38.380
Now we need to hone your message,
and we need to get some funds, fast.

24:38.480 --> 24:40.420
Let me introduce you
to Mark Ridley Thomas,

24:40.520 --> 24:43.380
- Los Angeles County Supervisor.
- How are you, sir?

24:43.480 --> 24:44.660
Pleased to make your acquaintance,
young man.

24:44.760 --> 24:46.620
- It's a pleasure.
- Pastor Marks,

24:46.720 --> 24:50.180
I would love for you to meet
Officer Kaz Nicol,

24:50.280 --> 24:51.580
the son of Captain Nicol.

24:51.680 --> 24:53.620
Kaz, let's cut right to the chase.

24:53.720 --> 24:55.500
We live in a whole different era now,

24:55.600 --> 24:57.660
where you can take advantage
of social media,

24:57.760 --> 25:00.580
you can take advantage of what's
happening when it comes to YouTube.

25:00.680 --> 25:03.660
But you gotta take advantage
of this hot media moment,

25:03.760 --> 25:07.700
because it may not ever come back
the way it is right now.

25:07.800 --> 25:10.660
- Doesn't have a chance, right?
- I'll be right back.

25:10.760 --> 25:12.540
Hey, what can I get you?

25:12.640 --> 25:15.061
- Guinness, please.
- You got it.

25:15.320 --> 25:16.820
Various news outlets have reported

25:16.920 --> 25:18.820
that on the night of
the Billboard Music Awards

25:18.920 --> 25:21.580
she got drunk and fell off the balcony

25:21.680 --> 25:24.060
of her luxury hotel in Los Angeles.

25:24.160 --> 25:27.380
Her publicist just released
a statement, and it says,

25:27.480 --> 25:29.660
"Noni loves life and music.

25:29.760 --> 25:32.660
She simply had too many
celebratory drinks

25:32.760 --> 25:35.260
- after winning her Billboard Award."
- Get you anything else?

25:35.360 --> 25:37.340
- Says, "Noni apologizes to her fans..."
- Excuse me.

25:37.440 --> 25:41.940
"...And will continue to be
a positive role model."

25:42.040 --> 25:45.940
"Positive role model,"
ladies and gentlemen. That's a quote.

25:54.160 --> 25:55.830
What the hell are you doing here, man?

25:58.240 --> 26:00.500
You know I love you
like a step-nephew, right?

26:00.600 --> 26:04.307
Good, 'cause I need a favor.

26:05.960 --> 26:07.620
Oh, man. Come on.

26:07.720 --> 26:10.300
She is out of your league.
You got dressed up for nothing.

26:10.400 --> 26:13.060
- I just need to see her for a second.
- You know I can't do that.

26:13.160 --> 26:16.264
Jesse, I'm asking.

26:19.120 --> 26:23.020
- You really wanna see her?
- Yes, I do.

26:23.120 --> 26:25.746
Then go wait at the curb
with the rest of the groupies.

26:29.240 --> 26:30.620
Hey!

26:30.720 --> 26:32.868
Go on.

26:34.880 --> 26:36.266
Eight.

26:41.200 --> 26:43.380
Heard you were looking for me.

26:43.480 --> 26:45.820
You look beautiful, baby! Right here!

26:47.720 --> 26:50.744
Yeah.

26:52.600 --> 26:56.750
Just wanted to apologize for the way
I acted after the press conference.

26:57.600 --> 27:00.660
You didn't deserve that.

27:00.760 --> 27:01.740
And...

27:01.840 --> 27:03.780
I'll be right there.

27:03.880 --> 27:07.507
- We're already late.
- Just a minute. Please.

27:18.920 --> 27:21.022
I'm sorry you had to lie.

27:21.760 --> 27:23.908
- Noni!
- I don't like doing that.

27:24.760 --> 27:26.060
Boy Scout?

27:26.160 --> 27:28.911
"Truth is the only safe ground
to stand upon."

27:29.880 --> 27:32.540
- You just eat a fortune cookie?
- No, it's a quote.

27:32.640 --> 27:35.107
I'm kind of big on quotes.

27:38.880 --> 27:42.180
Anyway, that's what I came to say.

27:42.280 --> 27:45.623
And to see if you're OK.

27:47.840 --> 27:51.780
What's your name... Officer Nicol?

27:51.880 --> 27:53.186
I'm Kaz.

27:54.280 --> 27:55.860
Short for Kazaam.

27:55.960 --> 27:57.460
- No.
- Yeah.

27:57.560 --> 28:00.540
My parents thought
it sounded African, so...

28:02.680 --> 28:08.549
Well, it's nice to
officially meet you, Kazaam.

28:08.800 --> 28:10.982
Doesn't sound so bad when you say it.

28:15.880 --> 28:17.186
This is me.

28:21.280 --> 28:22.825
You busy?

28:23.840 --> 28:24.941
Why?

28:25.680 --> 28:28.820
Noni, over here. You look
beautiful, baby. Right here!

28:30.760 --> 28:32.783
- Noni!
- Noni!

28:34.800 --> 28:36.631
Noni!

28:39.760 --> 28:42.300
- Have you been to rehab yet?
- Are you suicidal, Noni?

28:42.400 --> 28:43.900
Are you planning on
another suicide attempt?

28:44.000 --> 28:45.704
Jesus!

28:49.960 --> 28:51.949
You really gotta tint
these front windows.

28:54.600 --> 28:56.500
So, where am I going?

28:56.600 --> 29:00.785
How about we roll by my favorite spot,
get some food to go?

29:15.680 --> 29:17.728
Yeah.

29:27.280 --> 29:29.348
So what's this spot?

29:30.240 --> 29:32.820
Your mom and dad used to
bring you here when you were little?

29:32.920 --> 29:36.540
And you'd dream of all the places
you were gonna fly to?

29:36.640 --> 29:39.020
I just like watching planes.

29:39.120 --> 29:40.980
I still don't get why they don't drop.

29:41.080 --> 29:45.860
You must be real fun
to sit next to on a flight.

29:45.960 --> 29:49.542
- Never been.
- You've never been on a plane?

29:51.080 --> 29:54.229
I'm not trying to put my life
in someone else's hands.

29:55.800 --> 29:57.900
That's funny.

29:58.000 --> 30:01.263
My whole life's in someone else's hands.

30:04.880 --> 30:06.061
You look cold.

30:07.960 --> 30:09.391
Here.

30:16.680 --> 30:18.740
You good?

30:18.840 --> 30:20.988
Thanks.

30:31.080 --> 30:32.261
So what's it like?

30:34.120 --> 30:38.140
Being on a stage and...
all those people feeling you.

30:38.240 --> 30:40.741
It's a crazy high.

30:42.200 --> 30:43.904
Better than any drug.

30:47.640 --> 30:49.708
So what's it like for you?

30:52.040 --> 30:53.301
What?

30:54.880 --> 30:56.982
Saving someone's life.

30:58.240 --> 30:59.944
Crazy high.

31:01.080 --> 31:03.706
Better than any drug.

31:09.560 --> 31:11.344
I think you should get some help.

31:13.400 --> 31:14.911
I'm OK.

31:16.200 --> 31:17.745
For real.

31:17.920 --> 31:22.150
It was just a stupid, drunk mistake.

31:24.000 --> 31:25.750
Don't I look OK?

31:39.880 --> 31:42.028
What's this?

31:45.000 --> 31:47.980
A reporter gave it to me.

31:48.080 --> 31:50.260
He's from the Enquirer.

31:50.360 --> 31:52.064
I... I know.

31:53.760 --> 31:57.740
I haven't told him anything. Nothing.

31:57.840 --> 31:59.780
How much to keep your mouth shut?

31:59.880 --> 32:01.100
- What?
- Give me a number

32:01.200 --> 32:03.700
- and my mom will write you a check.
- No, wait, slow up. This isn't...

32:03.800 --> 32:05.780
I guess even Boy Scouts have a price?

32:05.880 --> 32:07.220
- I didn't ask for any of this.
- How much?

32:07.320 --> 32:09.422
I don't want your money.

32:19.600 --> 32:20.986
Seatbelt.

32:21.720 --> 32:23.151
Please.

32:42.000 --> 32:45.149
One-nine-oh-five Sunset Canyon.

32:46.280 --> 32:47.541
What's that?

32:49.440 --> 32:50.541
Where I wanna go.

33:16.960 --> 33:18.100
This you?

33:18.200 --> 33:19.745
My new crib.

33:21.120 --> 33:23.268
Looks like it's done.

33:25.320 --> 33:26.910
So you good then?

33:32.560 --> 33:34.300
You can call your people
and tell them where you are?

33:34.400 --> 33:37.060
This mean you're done saving me?

33:40.880 --> 33:44.140
Look, Noni... I don't know
how to play this game of yours.

33:44.240 --> 33:47.060
I know you're not gonna
call that reporter.

33:47.160 --> 33:48.546
Why not?

33:49.920 --> 33:52.466
- 'Cause.
- 'Cause?

34:08.480 --> 34:10.389
'Cause I see you, too.

34:20.400 --> 34:22.228
Later, Kazaam.

34:26.639 --> 34:28.549
Later, Noni Jean.

34:49.760 --> 34:52.340
I would have waited outside,
but it was a little crowded.

34:52.440 --> 34:54.668
He's fed.

34:55.639 --> 34:57.150
Thanks.

35:01.040 --> 35:03.860
- Sorry I left earlier.
- Me, too.

35:03.960 --> 35:07.420
Thought something was wrong
until I got a call from Miss Jean.

35:07.520 --> 35:09.260
Seems you took off with her daughter.

35:09.360 --> 35:12.340
She wanted to hang out.

35:12.440 --> 35:15.140
How do you hang out with Noni?

35:15.240 --> 35:18.460
We sat in the truck...
and ate fried chicken.

35:18.560 --> 35:22.028
- Bullshit.
- It's true.

35:23.240 --> 35:28.220
Look, Kaz, I know how easy it is
to be drawn to vics.

35:28.320 --> 35:30.060
They look at us like we're Superman.

35:30.160 --> 35:33.420
- It's gotta be exciting.
- This is different.

35:33.520 --> 35:38.060
Kaz... you have to think
like a politician now.

35:38.160 --> 35:42.860
Everything you do,
every person you're associated with,

35:42.960 --> 35:46.180
- is gonna be scrutinized.
- She's good people, Pop.

35:46.280 --> 35:48.140
You didn't meet her
in a church pew, son.

35:49.040 --> 35:50.991
Church girls are the ones
you gotta watch out for.

35:53.000 --> 35:57.230
But we both know,
this one ain't First Lady material.

36:04.480 --> 36:07.421
What's up, Black? You the Boy Scout?

36:15.280 --> 36:18.145
I need some protecting.

36:41.080 --> 36:42.511
Hi, guys.

36:47.320 --> 36:49.263
Hi, I'm Noni.

36:51.120 --> 36:53.340
I can't wait for the world to hear it.

36:53.440 --> 36:55.702
All right. Thank you, Keisha.

36:57.920 --> 37:00.830
- Hey.
- How you doing?

37:06.160 --> 37:08.060
Noni, did you really
try to kill yourself?

37:08.160 --> 37:09.580
Why won't you answer our questions?

37:09.680 --> 37:11.140
Move.

37:11.240 --> 37:14.389
Is this just a publicity stunt?

37:43.320 --> 37:44.780
That's it. Beautiful.

37:44.880 --> 37:46.620
Yeah, use that hood.

37:46.720 --> 37:48.460
Exactly.
Gonna move the chair for a second.

37:48.560 --> 37:49.660
Gonna need you on the floor, all right?

37:49.760 --> 37:51.860
- Nice.
- You getting full body as well?

37:51.960 --> 37:54.220
I am getting full body as well.

37:54.320 --> 37:56.420
That's foxy, that's it, right there.

37:56.520 --> 38:00.750
Can you arch your back just a little bit?
Little bit. Exactly. Good stuff.

38:01.560 --> 38:04.027
Noni, eyes back over here?

38:05.200 --> 38:07.700
Beautiful. Noni, show me.
We wanna see you.

38:07.800 --> 38:10.300
Exactly, a little bit of that.
All right, let's lose the jacket.

38:10.400 --> 38:11.865
Can we lose the jacket?

38:16.160 --> 38:18.581
That's right. Yeah.

38:20.440 --> 38:23.380
- Yeah, that'll look gorgeous.
- Do you want to get it? Thank you.

38:23.480 --> 38:24.940
Thank you, perfect.

38:25.040 --> 38:27.660
Angle your body a little toward...
There we go. That's it.

38:27.760 --> 38:30.540
- Whoo! Go, Noni.
- Perfect.

38:30.640 --> 38:33.020
This... this is it.

38:33.120 --> 38:35.540
That's that cover.
You want that cover? Let me see it.

38:36.940 --> 38:38.903
Are you an item?

38:39.800 --> 38:42.460
How does Kid feel about this?

38:42.560 --> 38:44.424
Noni, come on. Right here!

38:46.480 --> 38:49.265
So, how do you go like that every day?

38:51.120 --> 38:53.620
Normal's different for everybody,
I guess.

38:53.720 --> 38:55.500
I'm not the one jumping
in front of bullets.

38:55.600 --> 38:57.862
It doesn't exactly work like that.

38:58.840 --> 39:01.705
So, how come you're police?

39:02.560 --> 39:04.185
Trying on Daddy's shoes?

39:06.280 --> 39:09.340
- It's all a part of the plan.
- The plan?

39:09.440 --> 39:12.464
Political science major,
law enforcement, then politics.

39:13.320 --> 39:15.024
- For real?
- For real.

39:16.040 --> 39:17.980
Just wanna be a brother
who makes a difference, you know?

39:18.080 --> 39:20.340
Well, I'm gonna be calling you
about everything.

39:21.800 --> 39:23.380
The pothole in front of my crib.

39:23.480 --> 39:25.500
- Parking tickets.
- You might get your feelings hurt.

39:25.600 --> 39:27.941
- You can't say no to me.
- Try me.

39:28.720 --> 39:30.868
- Kiss me.
- No.

39:40.000 --> 39:41.590
<i>Come on, boy</i>

39:43.440 --> 39:45.900
<i>Come on, boy</i>

39:47.400 --> 39:49.500
<i>Come on, boy</i>

39:49.600 --> 39:51.140
No, I wanna hear it. Hold on.

39:51.240 --> 39:52.620
<i>Come on, boy</i>

39:52.720 --> 39:54.660
<i>Put your face in this...</i>

39:54.760 --> 39:56.560
Put your face where?

39:58.800 --> 40:01.180
- Look, I didn't write it, OK?
- All right.

40:02.560 --> 40:05.345
Now I know you don't know
nothing about this.

40:06.480 --> 40:07.547
Nina Simone.

40:12.080 --> 40:13.420
That voice.

40:15.280 --> 40:18.384
All that... pain and power.

40:19.400 --> 40:22.629
Like she lived every lyric.

40:26.160 --> 40:28.740
Wish I could have songs like that.

40:28.840 --> 40:29.987
So write one.

40:31.880 --> 40:33.780
No one cares what I have to say.

40:33.880 --> 40:35.584
I'm listening.

40:51.600 --> 40:52.861
What's all this?

40:54.520 --> 40:55.985
Ideas.

40:57.120 --> 40:58.267
Lyrics.

41:00.080 --> 41:02.308
They come into my head all day long.

41:07.960 --> 41:10.586
"It's not my business
what you had with her.

41:12.280 --> 41:14.462
And now I see
that you're not free of her.

41:15.640 --> 41:18.027
And I was foolish to compete with her.

41:20.000 --> 41:23.741
But my fractured heart cries,
'Choose me.'"

41:29.640 --> 41:31.026
That's beautiful.

41:32.240 --> 41:33.910
For real, I mean...

41:39.200 --> 41:42.460
You know,
I've seen letters from crazy people,

41:42.560 --> 41:44.503
and they look a lot like this.

41:48.520 --> 41:50.460
I got this dinner, I gotta go.

42:02.920 --> 42:06.020
It's not like I follow
this kind of thing, but...

42:06.120 --> 42:08.587
what's up with you and Kid?

42:13.840 --> 42:15.020
We're sort of together.

42:15.120 --> 42:16.540
Together?

42:16.640 --> 42:19.460
Look, it started as a label thing.

42:19.560 --> 42:21.901
- "A label thing"?
- For press.

42:24.160 --> 42:25.671
You get down like that?

42:28.320 --> 42:30.140
Look, I should've said something.

42:30.240 --> 42:32.780
But I didn't know
what was up with us before.

42:32.880 --> 42:34.664
And what is up?

42:43.480 --> 42:45.140
I gotta go.

42:45.240 --> 42:47.820
Kaz... Hey.

43:04.480 --> 43:09.740
Officer Nicol. I was more than willing
to break bread with you.

43:09.840 --> 43:13.740
But I'm not sure I can support someone
who looks like a college boy.

43:14.800 --> 43:18.060
It was a 26-year-old minister
that led the civil rights movement.

43:18.160 --> 43:21.140
Are you comparing yourself to Dr. King?

43:23.240 --> 43:25.740
Not at all, Reverend.

43:25.840 --> 43:27.780
What I mean to say is,

43:27.880 --> 43:31.180
progress rarely comes from those
who are content and secure.

43:31.280 --> 43:33.860
It comes from those who've been
unsettled by what they've seen.

43:34.560 --> 43:36.820
There's a daily violence
in our community.

43:36.920 --> 43:38.100
I have a front row seat to it.

43:38.200 --> 43:41.300
Nothing stops a bullet like a job.

43:41.400 --> 43:45.380
LA is better when
our community is strong.

43:45.480 --> 43:48.060
And I'm gonna inspire City Hall
to invest in us.

43:49.360 --> 43:51.740
Now, the truth is, I can't win
the election in this district

43:51.840 --> 43:52.987
without your support.

43:53.760 --> 43:58.100
I hope, as you become more familiar
with me, I can earn your respect.

43:58.200 --> 44:04.342
In the meantime, my actions will speak
louder than anything I can say tonight.

44:06.720 --> 44:08.663
I look forward to your actions.

44:14.640 --> 44:16.940
Everybody, we got Noni
in the house, baby!

44:22.120 --> 44:23.824
Yo, Noni, you gonna share?

44:25.240 --> 44:28.025
Whoo! All right, Noni!

45:53.840 --> 45:55.620
What up, Noni?

45:55.720 --> 45:58.780
Hey, Sean.

45:58.880 --> 46:01.980
- What's up, you all right?
- I'm good.

46:02.080 --> 46:03.620
You about to rehearse?

46:03.720 --> 46:06.940
No, actually I already did,
but I might stick around.

46:07.040 --> 46:09.260
I heard your show crazy.

46:09.360 --> 46:12.020
Well, you know,
just trying to keep up with you.

46:12.120 --> 46:14.020
Whatever. All right.

46:14.120 --> 46:16.740
The fact that I fell off the moped...

46:17.840 --> 46:19.829
That was crazy.

46:22.440 --> 46:23.746
Is he inside?

46:28.200 --> 46:29.790
What's up, baby girl?

46:38.320 --> 46:41.981
I thought I was the one supposed to be
getting in all the trouble around here.

46:42.640 --> 46:45.744
Listen...

46:47.760 --> 46:49.340
we need to talk.

46:49.440 --> 46:51.269
About what?

46:52.280 --> 46:57.341
Whatever it is we're doing...
It's not working for me anymore.

46:59.520 --> 47:02.140
I wanna go back to just being friends.

47:02.240 --> 47:05.540
I ain't gonna shed a tear
or nothing like that, but...

47:05.640 --> 47:06.940
I thought shit was cool with us.

47:07.040 --> 47:09.820
K.C., we texted,

47:09.920 --> 47:12.420
we hit it and we texted
about hitting it.

47:12.520 --> 47:14.500
That's damn near married, girl.

47:17.800 --> 47:20.028
Yo, they're ready for y'all.

47:32.960 --> 47:35.860
Hey... use the press.

47:35.960 --> 47:38.700
Don't let them use you, all right?

47:38.800 --> 47:40.380
Let's go get this rehearsal.

47:40.480 --> 47:42.780
You know I need to kill this stage.

47:42.880 --> 47:45.586
It's the only way I know
how to rock it, man. Come on.

47:45.920 --> 47:48.022
- Get off me!
- Get down!

47:48.280 --> 47:49.860
Ma'am, I need you
to stand back right now!

47:49.960 --> 47:52.060
- Let him go!
- Just keep your head down.

47:52.160 --> 47:55.420
- I'm not pressing charges.
- We don't need you to press charges.

47:55.520 --> 47:57.987
- I'm sorry.
- Calm down.

48:00.960 --> 48:02.020
I'm OK.

48:02.120 --> 48:05.780
You call me anytime.
Get you the help you need, OK?

48:05.880 --> 48:09.260
I just wanted him to stop and he did,
so can you please...

48:09.360 --> 48:11.300
Can you please just go? Just...

48:11.400 --> 48:14.060
Look at your kids, lady. Look.

48:14.160 --> 48:16.860
- Nothing's OK.
- Oh, baby.

48:18.160 --> 48:20.024
Need you to step out of the car, sir.

48:22.120 --> 48:25.030
You know I'll be out of here
in an hour, right? You know that?

48:26.160 --> 48:28.831
Turn and face the vehicle. Thank you.

48:29.960 --> 48:32.360
It's clear. Let's go.

48:33.360 --> 48:35.660
- Oh, shit.
- Hey!

48:35.760 --> 48:37.100
- Hey, Boy Scout.
- Noni!

48:37.200 --> 48:39.020
- Over here! Hey Noni, Noni!
- What's going on?

48:39.120 --> 48:41.860
I've got something for you.
Your shift over?

48:41.960 --> 48:43.500
Noni, over here. You look beautiful!

48:43.600 --> 48:44.860
Yes. His shift is over.

48:44.960 --> 48:47.740
We got paperwork we have to do,
all right?

48:47.840 --> 48:49.540
Go get in the car, dumb-ass.

48:51.520 --> 48:53.020
Just a look, girl, that's all I need!

48:53.120 --> 48:54.340
Noni!

48:54.440 --> 48:56.820
Noni, how long have you guys
been seeing each other?

48:56.920 --> 48:58.980
- Excuse me, people.
- Just tell the truth!

48:59.080 --> 49:01.100
- Hey, Noni, Noni!
- Thank you, excuse me.

49:01.200 --> 49:04.140
Hey, Mikey, make sure these guys
get some privacy, all right?

49:10.160 --> 49:13.020
Look, I got in
'cause I didn't wanna embarrass you.

49:13.120 --> 49:15.587
OK? But all this Hollywood mess...

49:17.520 --> 49:21.227
Look, my job is stressful enough,
I don't need this in my personal life.

49:22.000 --> 49:23.511
I broke up with him.

49:24.960 --> 49:26.220
I didn't ask you to.

49:26.320 --> 49:27.900
I didn't need your permission.

49:28.000 --> 49:29.431
Just your label's?

49:31.440 --> 49:34.146
I didn't need their permission, either.

49:36.000 --> 49:37.306
Why me?

49:39.440 --> 49:43.226
I mean, you... you could have anyone.

49:45.280 --> 49:47.348
I want you.

49:51.080 --> 49:52.227
Now...

49:53.920 --> 49:56.546
I said I had something for you.

50:04.760 --> 50:06.021
Trust me.

50:23.320 --> 50:25.707
Can I take this stuff off now?

50:59.240 --> 51:01.460
What's going on? Stop the plane!

51:01.560 --> 51:02.860
- Stop the plane!
- Kaz, it's OK.

51:02.960 --> 51:04.380
Noni, I'm not playing with you.
Stop the plane!

51:04.480 --> 51:06.140
Kaz!

51:09.320 --> 51:10.940
- Kaz.
- Hey...

51:18.560 --> 51:19.820
I wanna be your first.

51:32.080 --> 51:33.386
Shit.

51:35.520 --> 51:37.270
Oh...

51:37.520 --> 51:40.100
Oh, shit.

51:40.200 --> 51:43.820
I think I love you. Wait, no...

51:43.920 --> 51:46.388
- No?
- I mean...

51:47.240 --> 51:49.388
Hey. Take a look.

51:55.360 --> 51:56.985
Damn.

52:04.400 --> 52:06.264
Damn.

52:24.360 --> 52:26.300
Will you be my date for the show?

52:26.400 --> 52:29.583
I'm just your little bitch now?

52:31.280 --> 52:33.701
I'm performing
and I want you to be there.

52:37.400 --> 52:40.180
- How was the job today?
- The job?

52:41.920 --> 52:44.068
Isn't that what you police call it?

52:45.120 --> 52:46.500
The job was fine.

52:46.600 --> 52:48.907
You said it was stressful.

52:50.720 --> 52:54.060
It's just sometimes we deal with
the worst in people, you know?

52:54.160 --> 52:56.866
Makes it hard to trust in good.

52:59.080 --> 53:01.467
You feel like it's changed you?

53:05.320 --> 53:07.627
That why you don't have a girlfriend?

53:09.720 --> 53:11.902
I thought I did.

53:50.400 --> 53:52.420
Noni, please, this way!

54:01.720 --> 54:05.700
Oh, my goodness! She finally is here.
The girl I've been waiting for.

54:05.800 --> 54:08.740
Hi, Noni. You look fabulous.

54:08.840 --> 54:12.060
- And this dress, wow!
- Thank you.

54:12.160 --> 54:14.380
You might wanna tell your cameraman
to keep the camera on my face.

54:14.480 --> 54:16.260
I don't want you guys
getting sued by the FCC.

54:16.360 --> 54:18.740
It looks like we're all gonna be
in trouble tonight, with this dress.

54:18.840 --> 54:21.860
But on everybody's mind, really,
how are you doing?

54:21.960 --> 54:24.940
I'm great.
And I'm excited about tonight.

54:25.040 --> 54:28.940
And I see that you brought
your guardian angel with you.

54:29.040 --> 54:31.791
So, are you gonna keep her from falling?

54:32.280 --> 54:35.220
Oh. What's this?

54:35.320 --> 54:37.100
- He's my date.
- Wait a minute.

54:37.200 --> 54:39.260
So, is this an ET exclusive right now?

54:39.360 --> 54:40.860
You are confirming the rumors?

54:40.960 --> 54:42.460
Yes.

54:42.560 --> 54:45.220
Well, you are truly
living the fairy tale.

54:45.320 --> 54:48.469
And I know you have a busy night,
so off you go with your date.

54:52.400 --> 54:53.460
- Hi, Miss Lee.
- Hi, Macy.

54:53.560 --> 54:55.420
- Hi.
- Really looking forward

54:55.520 --> 54:57.140
to Noni's performance tonight.

54:57.240 --> 54:58.900
Oh, yeah, I think it's gonna be amazing.

54:59.000 --> 55:01.831
Yeah, great. Hi, Officer Hero.

55:05.320 --> 55:07.502
Officer Hero.

55:12.560 --> 55:17.420
Let me tell you something.
This thing, whatever it is,

55:17.520 --> 55:19.060
it's not good for her.

55:19.160 --> 55:20.660
How's that?

55:20.760 --> 55:25.260
When people see you two together,
they see her back on that balcony.

55:25.360 --> 55:30.500
So, Kid Culprit.
He's better for her?

55:30.600 --> 55:33.700
Well, he doesn't throw her
off her game. You do.

55:33.800 --> 55:35.580
I saved her life.

55:35.680 --> 55:37.860
You're a cop. That's sort of your job.

55:37.960 --> 55:40.140
What about your job?

55:40.240 --> 55:44.380
I mean, I know if I had a daughter,
especially one as amazing as that one,

55:44.480 --> 55:45.422
I'd get her some help.

55:46.760 --> 55:48.980
You've been screwing her
for five minutes.

55:49.080 --> 55:50.705
You've got her all figured out.

55:52.200 --> 55:55.941
Seven thousand people out there
about to start screaming her name.

55:56.440 --> 55:59.623
I promise you,
that is all the help she needs.

56:01.080 --> 56:03.860
All right, this... Is a simple knot.

56:03.960 --> 56:07.189
The dancers will tug on the shoulders
and it'll open right up.

56:08.360 --> 56:10.740
Take a look.

56:10.840 --> 56:12.465
I'm good.

56:13.800 --> 56:16.710
Well, I'm gonna grab the topstick
and be right back.

59:12.080 --> 59:14.751
Hey, hold up. Hold up, man.

59:16.120 --> 59:19.140
Let me set the record straight.

59:19.240 --> 59:22.820
See, I ain't been getting cheated on,
you heard? I cut her off.

59:22.920 --> 59:24.860
That's why she took
that sky dive off the balcony.

59:24.960 --> 59:26.180
What are you doing?

59:26.280 --> 59:28.109
Kill his mic. Kill his mic.

59:37.520 --> 59:39.420
You see Officer Hero right here?

59:39.520 --> 59:41.940
He's just getting my sloppy seconds.

59:43.400 --> 59:46.071
- Damn right!
- What's up, man?

59:48.060 --> 59:49.940
Kick his ass!

59:51.640 --> 59:53.780
She just with you
to keep you quiet, fam.

59:53.880 --> 59:55.220
Dead silent.

59:55.320 --> 59:57.184
Man, you know that bitch is a freak.

01:00:13.120 --> 01:00:14.820
So, you're a thug now.

01:00:14.920 --> 01:00:17.620
You're feeling your Wheaties
'cause you're banging a superstar.

01:00:17.720 --> 01:00:20.660
- I was defending her.
- You threw the first punch.

01:00:20.760 --> 01:00:22.740
- That ain't self-defense...
- I didn't say it was self-defense.

01:00:22.840 --> 01:00:24.660
I said I was defending her.

01:00:24.760 --> 01:00:27.780
You just got into a brawl
with a rapper on national TV.

01:00:27.880 --> 01:00:31.220
Is that how you expect to gain
the respect of the pastors?

01:00:31.320 --> 01:00:34.390
- That crazy broad has got you all...
- Don't you call her that!

01:00:36.920 --> 01:00:39.420
It's your life, Kaz.

01:00:39.520 --> 01:00:42.540
Get your head out of your ass
before you throw it away...

01:00:42.640 --> 01:00:45.260
Why don't you just go
get your own life, all right?

01:00:45.360 --> 01:00:47.189
So you don't have to worry
so much about mine.

01:00:52.960 --> 01:00:56.542
It could... It could just be
a non-story tomorrow. Gimme...

01:00:58.160 --> 01:01:00.627
Come on, Liam, please.

01:01:06.920 --> 01:01:10.460
- Mom...
- Congratulations.

01:01:10.560 --> 01:01:12.822
You're a bloody cliché.

01:01:44.080 --> 01:01:45.780
Noni, Noni!

01:01:45.880 --> 01:01:49.820
Hey! Stop, stop... stop.

01:01:50.620 --> 01:01:53.460
Stop. Stop!

01:01:54.860 --> 01:01:56.460
Stop.

01:02:06.560 --> 01:02:10.900
I feel like I'm suffocating
in the middle of the street

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:13.780
and no one can see me dying.

01:02:21.860 --> 01:02:23.988
Let me see. Let me see.

01:02:59.880 --> 01:03:02.540
Kaz, over here!

01:03:02.640 --> 01:03:04.902
- Where is she?
- Where's Noni?

01:03:18.040 --> 01:03:19.860
Kaz!

01:03:19.960 --> 01:03:21.460
Where's Noni?

01:03:21.560 --> 01:03:23.344
Come on!

01:03:55.920 --> 01:03:58.740
Hey, Jesse, it's me.
I need a favor, man.

01:03:58.840 --> 01:04:02.340
I need you to talk to Sarge,
tell him I'll be out a couple days.

01:04:02.440 --> 01:04:04.940
And everything's cool...

01:04:05.040 --> 01:04:09.031
I just need some time off
All right? Thanks.

01:05:54.720 --> 01:05:56.663
So now what?

01:05:58.040 --> 01:05:59.824
Whatever you want.

01:06:04.760 --> 01:06:06.464
Can I sleep?

01:06:08.240 --> 01:06:10.024
Just for a little bit.

01:06:37.280 --> 01:06:39.462
Hey, girl.

01:06:54.960 --> 01:06:56.408
You're awake.

01:07:00.480 --> 01:07:02.309
How long have I been out?

01:07:03.900 --> 01:07:09.060
Well... that was lunch, that was dinner,

01:07:09.160 --> 01:07:12.787
and this... is breakfast.

01:07:13.820 --> 01:07:15.260
Wow.

01:07:15.360 --> 01:07:18.260
- Sorry.
- No, it's OK.

01:07:18.360 --> 01:07:20.020
You hungry?

01:07:20.120 --> 01:07:21.900
Starving.

01:07:22.600 --> 01:07:24.190
So starving.

01:07:29.040 --> 01:07:31.260
Sorry, sorry.

01:07:31.960 --> 01:07:34.340
- Geez, talons.
- Oh, my God.

01:07:34.440 --> 01:07:36.383
All right, that's it.

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:39.343
Nails be gone.

01:07:45.560 --> 01:07:47.344
Dah!

01:12:04.480 --> 01:12:06.105
Hey.

01:13:17.760 --> 01:13:19.660
Silver, silver, silver, necklace.

01:13:19.760 --> 01:13:22.660
Beautiful silver for your
beautiful señorita, señor.

01:13:22.760 --> 01:13:25.460
Silver here, very cheap,
very cheap, mister.

01:13:28.280 --> 01:13:32.700
No, no, we can't afford it.
We just bought these clothes and...

01:13:32.800 --> 01:13:34.700
What? Give me the money.

01:13:34.800 --> 01:13:37.100
No, it's like six meals.

01:13:37.200 --> 01:13:39.060
- I'm good for it.
- Really?

01:13:39.160 --> 01:13:40.864
- Yeah.
- Check your pockets, homie.

01:13:42.880 --> 01:13:44.823
You are B-R-O-K-E, broke,
so come on, let's go.

01:13:45.320 --> 01:13:47.263
Vamos.

01:13:51.920 --> 01:13:54.830
Wait, what are you doing?

01:13:55.960 --> 01:13:57.540
Gracias, señorita.

01:13:57.640 --> 01:13:58.780
No, gracias, señor.

01:13:58.880 --> 01:14:00.740
Are you for real?

01:14:00.840 --> 01:14:03.940
This is worth way more
than the earrings.

01:14:04.040 --> 01:14:05.266
Oh, they're fake.

01:14:06.560 --> 01:14:08.264
What are you doing?

01:14:09.440 --> 01:14:11.860
This is a merit badge.

01:14:11.960 --> 01:14:14.142
You have to earn these.

01:14:17.800 --> 01:14:22.144
For throwing me the middle finger
the night we first met.

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:26.140
For saying "I love you" and meaning it,

01:14:26.240 --> 01:14:29.140
even if it was just for a second.

01:14:29.240 --> 01:14:31.502
For not caring about the fame.

01:14:33.800 --> 01:14:37.871
And for standing here with me,
in this moment.

01:14:39.920 --> 01:14:42.780
And for truth, justice,
and the American way.

01:14:42.880 --> 01:14:44.908
Thank you.

01:14:45.800 --> 01:14:49.666
Hey, I'm sorry to bother you,
but would you mind taking a picture?

01:14:52.960 --> 01:14:54.949
- Sure.
- Thanks.

01:14:56.040 --> 01:14:57.505
OK...

01:14:59.320 --> 01:15:00.831
The two of us.

01:15:04.520 --> 01:15:06.146
Ready?

01:15:09.760 --> 01:15:10.908
Thanks again.

01:15:13.640 --> 01:15:17.380
<i>One, two, three, four
Come on, baby, say you love me</i>

01:15:17.480 --> 01:15:19.780
<i>Five, six, seven times</i>

01:15:20.840 --> 01:15:22.740
<i>Eight, nine, ten, once</i>

01:15:22.840 --> 01:15:24.700
Once is 11!

01:15:24.800 --> 01:15:27.900
<i>Until you are mine</i>

01:15:30.280 --> 01:15:33.623
- Whoo!
- Whoo-whoo-whoo!

01:15:35.040 --> 01:15:37.060
Get up there.

01:15:37.160 --> 01:15:38.940
What?

01:15:39.040 --> 01:15:40.980
You wanted to know
what it feels like, remember?

01:15:41.080 --> 01:15:42.900
I am not that drunk.

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:45.620
You telling me you're scared?

01:15:45.720 --> 01:15:47.868
The flying thing was bad enough.

01:15:49.080 --> 01:15:50.940
It's like that?

01:15:51.040 --> 01:15:52.949
OK, all right.

01:16:16.280 --> 01:16:17.580
All right.

01:16:21.240 --> 01:16:25.500
I'm dedicating this song to my lady
sitting right over there at the bar.

01:16:25.600 --> 01:16:28.260
- Aw!
- You know who you are.

01:16:32.200 --> 01:16:36.100
<i>Ooh!</i>

01:16:36.200 --> 01:16:38.300
<i>Ooh!</i>

01:16:38.400 --> 01:16:41.788
<i>Come on, yeah</i>

01:16:46.080 --> 01:16:49.180
<i>On a perfect day</i>

01:16:49.280 --> 01:16:52.860
<i>I know that I can count on you</i>

01:16:52.960 --> 01:16:54.471
<i>Ooh</i>

01:16:56.160 --> 01:16:59.180
<i>When that's impossible</i>

01:16:59.280 --> 01:17:02.580
<i>Tell me, can you weather the storm?</i>

01:17:02.680 --> 01:17:04.900
Sing it, bro!

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:08.080
<i>And I need somebody</i>

01:17:08.280 --> 01:17:11.220
<i>Who can stand by me</i>

01:17:11.320 --> 01:17:13.540
<i>Through the good times</i>

01:17:13.640 --> 01:17:17.187
<i>And bad times, you will always</i>

01:17:18.560 --> 01:17:21.180
<i>Be right there for me</i>

01:17:21.280 --> 01:17:22.300
<i>Eee-ee</i>

01:17:22.400 --> 01:17:24.580
<i>Sunny days</i>

01:17:24.680 --> 01:17:28.180
<i>Whoa, whoa, whoa</i>

01:17:28.280 --> 01:17:30.223
<i>Tell me, baby</i>

01:17:33.760 --> 01:17:35.540
Can you stand the rain? Can y'all...?

01:17:35.640 --> 01:17:36.821
You can do better?

01:17:38.160 --> 01:17:40.149
Let's see what you got.

01:17:49.840 --> 01:17:52.060
- Yeah!
- Whoo! Come on!

01:17:52.160 --> 01:17:54.581
- Hey.
- Hola.

01:17:57.120 --> 01:17:58.665
Whoo!

01:18:01.080 --> 01:18:04.229
I'm gonna sing this song.

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:08.661
But I don't think
they have the music, so...

01:18:09.400 --> 01:18:11.628
I'm just gonna sing it a cappella.

01:18:19.120 --> 01:18:21.791
<i>Why you wanna fly</i>

01:18:22.880 --> 01:18:24.780
<i>Blackbird?</i>

01:18:27.040 --> 01:18:30.110
<i>You ain't never gonna fly</i>

01:18:35.080 --> 01:18:37.308
<i>Why you wanna fly</i>

01:18:38.680 --> 01:18:40.908
<i>Blackbird?</i>

01:18:42.440 --> 01:18:45.589
<i>You ain't never gonna fly</i>

01:18:50.160 --> 01:18:53.150
<i>No place big enough for holdin'</i>

01:18:55.520 --> 01:18:59.420
<i>All the tears you're gonna cry</i>

01:19:00.120 --> 01:19:03.580
<i>'Cause your mama's name was lonely</i>

01:19:03.680 --> 01:19:06.829
<i>'Cause your mama's name was lonely</i>

01:19:09.640 --> 01:19:14.268
<i>And your daddy's name was pain</i>

01:19:14.680 --> 01:19:16.820
<i>And they called you little sorrow</i>

01:19:16.920 --> 01:19:20.342
<i>And they called you little sorrow</i>

01:19:22.680 --> 01:19:26.387
<i>'Cause you'll never love again</i>

01:19:29.320 --> 01:19:33.345
<i>You ain't got no one to hold you</i>

01:19:34.120 --> 01:19:38.191
<i>You ain't got no one to care</i>

01:19:40.320 --> 01:19:44.260
<i>If you'd only understand dear</i>

01:19:44.360 --> 01:19:47.420
<i>Nobody</i>

01:19:47.520 --> 01:19:51.420
<i>Wants you anywhere</i>

01:19:52.360 --> 01:19:56.060
<i>So why you wanna fly</i>

01:19:56.160 --> 01:19:58.940
<i>Blackbird?</i>

01:19:59.040 --> 01:20:02.189
<i>You ain't never gonna fly</i>

01:20:04.640 --> 01:20:07.505
<i>Why you wanna fly</i>

01:20:08.880 --> 01:20:11.301
<i>Blackbird?</i>

01:20:12.760 --> 01:20:15.300
<i>You ain't never</i>

01:20:15.400 --> 01:20:17.423
<i>Gonna</i>

01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:21.380
<i>Fly</i>

01:20:30.400 --> 01:20:34.186
- Whoo!
- Bravo!

01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:54.460
Oh.

01:20:54.560 --> 01:20:57.550
That's the maid.
We need more bottled water.

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:10.784
All right.

01:21:23.680 --> 01:21:26.780
You did this? You brought them here?

01:21:26.880 --> 01:21:28.780
They found you the same way that I did.

01:21:28.880 --> 01:21:30.470
Let me in.

01:21:38.400 --> 01:21:41.340
<i>You ain't never</i>

01:21:41.440 --> 01:21:43.304
<i>Gonna</i>

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:47.260
<i>Fly</i>

01:21:50.460 --> 01:21:52.404
That was the first song you ever sang.

01:21:53.840 --> 01:21:55.420
I know.

01:21:55.520 --> 01:21:58.660
My first talent contest.

01:21:58.760 --> 01:22:00.540
No.

01:22:00.640 --> 01:22:03.460
When you were seven months old,

01:22:03.560 --> 01:22:07.585
we were living in this awful
council flat, had a hole in the door.

01:22:08.640 --> 01:22:11.700
And I was making you Ready brek.

01:22:11.800 --> 01:22:14.790
And you were lying on the floor
behind me, screaming.

01:22:15.640 --> 01:22:17.780
And "Blackbird" came on the radio.

01:22:17.880 --> 01:22:19.141
I turned it up.

01:22:20.880 --> 01:22:22.740
I wasn't trying to drown you out.

01:22:22.840 --> 01:22:26.945
The words were just... how I felt.

01:22:30.400 --> 01:22:32.423
I was 17 when I had you.

01:22:34.120 --> 01:22:37.500
Black baby, that my mom
and dad wanted no part of,

01:22:37.600 --> 01:22:40.431
by a guy who couldn't
give a shit about me.

01:22:41.800 --> 01:22:45.347
And I was exactly
where they all said I'd be.

01:22:49.640 --> 01:22:53.904
And then, all of a sudden,
you started singing.

01:22:55.400 --> 01:23:00.260
Not the words... but the melody.

01:23:00.360 --> 01:23:02.383
Clear as day.

01:23:05.360 --> 01:23:08.420
And I was so shocked,
I started laughing.

01:23:08.520 --> 01:23:12.102
And that made you laugh,
and then we're both there laughing.

01:23:14.640 --> 01:23:16.947
And it felt like you and me
against the world.

01:23:19.200 --> 01:23:21.382
It still feels like that.

01:23:26.520 --> 01:23:28.429
You look happy.

01:23:31.440 --> 01:23:33.781
You were right to get away.

01:23:36.400 --> 01:23:39.026
Let's go back and finish it, Nones.

01:23:39.760 --> 01:23:42.340
We can't give up.

01:23:42.440 --> 01:23:44.986
Not after everything we've been through.

01:23:49.320 --> 01:23:51.460
I don't have a deal.

01:23:51.560 --> 01:23:54.220
I'm a joke.

01:23:54.320 --> 01:23:55.421
Well...

01:23:56.520 --> 01:24:00.260
that clip got 400,000 hits
since yesterday.

01:24:00.360 --> 01:24:01.507
Are you serious?

01:24:03.400 --> 01:24:05.582
And Liam called me this morning.

01:24:31.640 --> 01:24:34.471
I needed a pause button.

01:24:36.200 --> 01:24:37.780
That's what you did.

01:24:37.880 --> 01:24:39.740
You put my life on pause.

01:24:39.840 --> 01:24:42.307
But we can't hide out here forever.

01:24:45.120 --> 01:24:47.940
I guess I was just drinking some
happily ever after bullshit?

01:24:48.040 --> 01:24:50.220
We can still have happy ever after.

01:24:50.320 --> 01:24:52.580
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:24:52.680 --> 01:24:54.145
When?

01:24:55.040 --> 01:24:56.700
'Cause obviously nothing's changed.

01:24:56.800 --> 01:24:59.580
It's already different.

01:24:59.680 --> 01:25:04.260
I feel like I can finally
do it the right way.

01:25:04.360 --> 01:25:05.540
My way.

01:25:05.640 --> 01:25:08.500
- What about your mom?
- She gets it now, too.

01:25:08.600 --> 01:25:10.628
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:25:12.360 --> 01:25:14.428
She know about your box of lyrics?

01:25:18.320 --> 01:25:21.902
Yeah... I give it a week.

01:25:22.960 --> 01:25:27.145
You'll be back in a weave,
singing while sucking dick.

01:25:28.080 --> 01:25:31.060
- I appreciate your honesty, Officer.
- Shit, Noni, I'm trying to help you!

01:25:31.160 --> 01:25:33.149
Stop trying to be the bloody hero
all the time.

01:25:41.440 --> 01:25:44.111
Look, Kaz...

01:25:47.840 --> 01:25:51.228
I've been working for this
my whole life.

01:25:52.160 --> 01:25:54.786
I want you to be a part of it.

01:25:56.080 --> 01:25:57.227
I need you.

01:25:59.840 --> 01:26:01.624
And you need me.

01:26:04.320 --> 01:26:06.149
You don't need me.

01:26:07.720 --> 01:26:09.470
And I'm good.

01:26:22.480 --> 01:26:25.390
- Here she comes.
- Noni!

01:26:25.520 --> 01:26:28.300
Are you planning on
another suicide attempt?

01:27:08.640 --> 01:27:09.780
I cleaned up.

01:27:09.880 --> 01:27:11.982
Do you want a cup of tea?

01:27:48.880 --> 01:27:51.620
Councilman Russell
is resigning tomorrow.

01:27:51.720 --> 01:27:53.900
So we would need to announce by Friday.

01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:55.780
And what about the pastors?

01:27:55.880 --> 01:27:58.180
You said before
we couldn't win without 'em.

01:27:58.280 --> 01:28:01.980
The rapper called your girlfriend
a bitch and you kicked his ass.

01:28:02.080 --> 01:28:04.220
You lost the church,
but you gained the youth vote.

01:28:04.320 --> 01:28:06.580
You're that candidate with swagger.

01:28:06.680 --> 01:28:09.340
I'm not so sure that's the angle
we wanna go with.

01:28:09.440 --> 01:28:11.180
It's the only angle we have.

01:28:11.280 --> 01:28:14.500
It's risky. Your call.

01:28:14.600 --> 01:28:15.986
- I think...
- Let's run with it.

01:28:17.600 --> 01:28:19.225
See what happens.

01:28:19.960 --> 01:28:21.471
Pop.

01:28:27.620 --> 01:28:30.260
The clip is so official, Noni.

01:28:31.360 --> 01:28:35.380
Seven million hits in two days? What?

01:28:35.480 --> 01:28:37.460
I need your album out,
like, yesterday, so...

01:28:37.560 --> 01:28:39.230
we got all hands on deck.

01:28:41.800 --> 01:28:45.382
- It's not done.
- What's not done?

01:28:47.320 --> 01:28:51.300
I wrote a song
and I want it on the album.

01:28:53.280 --> 01:28:55.060
Why you playing with me?

01:28:55.160 --> 01:28:58.340
Trey, everybody says I'm special
'cause I have this voice.

01:28:58.440 --> 01:29:00.580
But I'm just saying what
everybody else wants me to say.

01:29:00.680 --> 01:29:02.430
I need to say something.

01:29:02.960 --> 01:29:08.340
Listen, I was an artist,
so I respect that, for real.

01:29:08.440 --> 01:29:12.780
But... CD's been pressed,
artwork's finished.

01:29:12.880 --> 01:29:14.425
It's done and done.

01:29:15.960 --> 01:29:19.220
But you know what?
When the album blows up,

01:29:19.320 --> 01:29:21.991
we'll do a special re-release,
and drop "Blackbird" on it.

01:29:22.720 --> 01:29:23.821
Cool?

01:29:28.520 --> 01:29:33.387
Either you put her song on the record
or you release it without an artist.

01:29:36.440 --> 01:29:40.020
Come on, Macy, it's all love in here.

01:29:40.120 --> 01:29:43.020
- What's with the idle threats?
- There's nothing idle about it.

01:29:43.120 --> 01:29:46.780
Deals can be a little complicated,
but I can assure you, she has no outs.

01:29:46.880 --> 01:29:51.420
Yeah. Well, you see,
the morning after the concert,

01:29:51.520 --> 01:29:54.100
this came through my fax machine.

01:29:54.200 --> 01:29:56.380
It's a letter of termination.

01:29:56.480 --> 01:29:58.220
We never sent a letter of termination.

01:29:58.320 --> 01:30:00.100
- That was sent by mistake.
- Excuse me?

01:30:00.200 --> 01:30:03.260
I... I drafted it as a precaution.

01:30:03.360 --> 01:30:06.420
I-I left it on my desk.
My assistant must have sent it. I...

01:30:06.520 --> 01:30:08.782
It was a mistake, Noni, I apologize.

01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:12.780
I know the legalese
can be a bit complicated, Liam.

01:30:12.880 --> 01:30:15.940
The thing is, once that comes
through a fax machine,

01:30:16.040 --> 01:30:17.660
it's legally binding.

01:30:17.760 --> 01:30:19.560
So as of now, there is no deal.

01:30:21.360 --> 01:30:24.020
Do you have any idea
how much it's gonna cost me?

01:30:24.120 --> 01:30:27.660
Yeah. But I think Liam's salary
will just about cover it.

01:30:27.760 --> 01:30:29.060
Trey, look, I can fix this...

01:30:29.160 --> 01:30:32.620
If you want another chance,
you can buy one for 200K.

01:30:43.680 --> 01:30:48.388
Now... I'm gonna need you
to do something for me.

01:30:49.040 --> 01:30:50.551
And I ain't asking.

01:30:54.240 --> 01:30:56.866
End this, Noni. Definitively.

01:30:57.600 --> 01:31:02.501
You love life, it was an accident.
Move the hell on.

01:31:04.760 --> 01:31:06.066
OK.

01:31:07.560 --> 01:31:09.180
Mom's famous.

01:31:09.280 --> 01:31:12.111
Oh, yeah, I used to call
everything Mom's famous.

01:31:17.040 --> 01:31:19.220
Keysburry called.

01:31:19.320 --> 01:31:21.627
They want you to close with "Blackbird."

01:31:22.400 --> 01:31:23.980
Are you serious?

01:31:24.080 --> 01:31:26.865
Not bad for a couple of Brixton girls?

01:31:29.120 --> 01:31:32.580
I gotta talk to the label,
'cause, you know,

01:31:32.680 --> 01:31:35.740
we don't wanna confuse the public
about who you are.

01:31:35.840 --> 01:31:39.183
I think you made it clear
who's running things.

01:31:40.520 --> 01:31:42.588
Tell 'em I wanna do it.

01:31:46.960 --> 01:31:50.540
You know, I was thinking about
Ryan Tedder producing my song.

01:31:50.640 --> 01:31:52.620
Can we find out his schedule?

01:31:52.720 --> 01:31:56.541
Oh, Noni, we can't delay the album.

01:31:57.640 --> 01:31:58.900
What do you mean?

01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:01.700
Well, the buzz right now is insane.
We can't take any chances.

01:32:01.800 --> 01:32:03.345
It needs to be out.

01:32:05.760 --> 01:32:08.860
But... in the meeting,
you said I wouldn't re-sign.

01:32:08.960 --> 01:32:10.744
Yeah, 'cause I wanted Liam gone.

01:32:12.440 --> 01:32:14.622
But this isn't about Liam,
it's about me.

01:32:16.600 --> 01:32:21.220
The next album, you wanna write a couple
of songs, write a couple of songs.

01:32:21.320 --> 01:32:23.860
- Do that, I promise.
- Mom...

01:32:23.960 --> 01:32:26.506
We all win here, Noni.

01:32:27.840 --> 01:32:29.700
- I'm not doing it.
- Not doing what?

01:32:29.800 --> 01:32:31.660
- I'm not re-signing.
- Yes, you bloody are.

01:32:31.760 --> 01:32:33.225
You work for me, remember?

01:32:38.480 --> 01:32:40.700
You know, I always wondered
when I'd do a shoot or something

01:32:40.800 --> 01:32:43.260
and they'd tell me to hike my skirt
up more or take off my shirt,

01:32:43.360 --> 01:32:46.260
and I'd look to you to see if it was OK,
and it was always OK.

01:32:46.360 --> 01:32:48.660
Would you look around you? It is OK.

01:32:48.760 --> 01:32:50.100
It's not OK! It never was!

01:32:50.200 --> 01:32:53.700
Noni, the song doesn't make you,
you make the song.

01:32:53.800 --> 01:32:56.700
It's a game, right?
You know that. It's a game!

01:32:56.800 --> 01:32:59.500
So what, you give me a new nose,
a new body, some Indian chick's hair.

01:32:59.600 --> 01:33:01.420
New and improved,
except I'm not a bloody product.

01:33:01.520 --> 01:33:03.260
We did what we had to do.

01:33:03.360 --> 01:33:06.100
There was never any "we."
Your word was gospel.

01:33:06.200 --> 01:33:07.700
Oh, wait, so now you're a victim?

01:33:07.800 --> 01:33:10.260
When did you ever tell me
that you didn't want this?

01:33:10.360 --> 01:33:12.986
When I was on that balcony.

01:33:14.560 --> 01:33:16.820
You promised me that was a mistake.

01:33:16.920 --> 01:33:18.620
You wanted it to be a mistake.

01:33:18.720 --> 01:33:20.980
When I needed a mother,
you were always my manager.

01:33:21.080 --> 01:33:23.580
I was your manager, I was your mother,
I was your father,

01:33:23.680 --> 01:33:26.300
I was whatever I had to be
in order to take care of you!

01:33:26.400 --> 01:33:27.820
You didn't take care of me,
you took care of my career!

01:33:27.920 --> 01:33:30.060
And I made you a bloody star!

01:33:30.160 --> 01:33:32.620
And everyone who looked down on you
would suddenly look up to you.

01:33:32.720 --> 01:33:35.500
Prove to the world
you weren't a fuck-up.

01:33:35.600 --> 01:33:37.420
It was never about me,
it was always about you.

01:33:37.520 --> 01:33:40.146
Don't you dare question my love for you!

01:33:41.560 --> 01:33:44.106
Noni, come on.

01:33:51.160 --> 01:33:52.307
You're fired.

01:34:29.680 --> 01:34:31.270
Good evening, sir.

01:34:35.920 --> 01:34:40.230
Good evening...
I'll be there in a second.

01:34:43.640 --> 01:34:44.980
Hi.

01:34:48.240 --> 01:34:49.944
Hey.

01:34:51.120 --> 01:34:52.381
You have to go?

01:34:53.920 --> 01:34:56.751
Yeah, I'm being vetted.

01:34:57.560 --> 01:34:58.620
Vetted?

01:34:58.720 --> 01:35:02.108
Classy way of begging for money.

01:35:04.600 --> 01:35:06.828
So you're gonna shake up the world?

01:35:07.560 --> 01:35:09.071
That's the plan.

01:35:15.640 --> 01:35:17.868
That night, on the balcony...

01:35:20.360 --> 01:35:21.950
you saw the goodness in me.

01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:28.185
And it was enough to keep me going
until I could finally see it in myself.

01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:34.706
Sorry it took me so long.

01:35:36.120 --> 01:35:38.427
Me, too.

01:35:43.880 --> 01:35:45.789
I should let you go.

01:35:49.560 --> 01:35:50.946
Take care, Noni.

01:35:56.920 --> 01:35:58.021
Kaz?

01:36:01.040 --> 01:36:03.791
It was perfect, right?

01:36:05.200 --> 01:36:06.301
What we had.

01:36:09.840 --> 01:36:11.829
We started on a lie.

01:36:13.760 --> 01:36:15.942
So it could never be perfect.

01:36:51.680 --> 01:36:53.940
I like the blue.

01:36:54.040 --> 01:36:55.949
Purple is the new blue.

01:36:59.440 --> 01:37:00.871
Excuse me.

01:37:02.720 --> 01:37:04.620
You'll have all of this ready
for us by Wednesday, right?

01:37:04.720 --> 01:37:05.860
Hello?

01:37:05.960 --> 01:37:08.740
- Not Thursday.
- This is he.

01:37:08.840 --> 01:37:10.351
Where are you?

01:37:11.120 --> 01:37:12.984
I'm on my way. I gotta go.

01:37:14.200 --> 01:37:16.428
Hold on, we just need
a few more seconds.

01:37:29.440 --> 01:37:31.860
- Hey.
- I'm so sorry. I shouldn't have called.

01:37:31.960 --> 01:37:33.940
I made a mistake.

01:37:34.040 --> 01:37:35.420
You can do this,
just come with me right now.

01:37:35.520 --> 01:37:36.980
- No, I can't.
- Yes, you can.

01:37:38.080 --> 01:37:40.468
My kids are in there.

01:37:44.040 --> 01:37:46.900
- Just stay here, OK?
- Don't.

01:37:50.800 --> 01:37:52.902
Hey, Officer Asshole.

01:37:59.840 --> 01:38:01.391
No!

01:38:21.800 --> 01:38:24.260
And I hear you're gonna be performing
in the UK this weekend.

01:38:24.360 --> 01:38:26.100
That's right. I'm so excited.

01:38:26.200 --> 01:38:27.860
I haven't performed at home
since I was a kid.

01:38:27.960 --> 01:38:29.340
Are you really British?

01:38:29.440 --> 01:38:32.540
And I ask because
your former rapper boyfriend

01:38:32.640 --> 01:38:35.220
has been tweeting that
you're faking that accent.

01:38:38.720 --> 01:38:42.063
Well, I faked a lot
of things when I was with him,

01:38:42.200 --> 01:38:43.940
but my accent wasn't one of them.

01:38:44.040 --> 01:38:45.820
Ouch.

01:38:45.920 --> 01:38:48.102
Sorry, I shouldn't have said that.

01:38:49.120 --> 01:38:50.984
You've been doing a lot of that lately.

01:38:51.880 --> 01:38:54.660
- What?
- Apologizing for your actions.

01:38:54.760 --> 01:38:57.511
Are you concerned at all
about your image?

01:38:58.800 --> 01:39:00.260
I'm not concerned at all.

01:39:00.360 --> 01:39:03.660
Your record company insists
that you wanted to come on the air,

01:39:03.760 --> 01:39:08.100
and you wanted to get rid
of those rumors, once and for all.

01:39:08.200 --> 01:39:12.060
Well, firstly, I'd like
to compliment the tabloids

01:39:12.160 --> 01:39:16.180
for their ability to capture
those amazingly bad pictures of me.

01:39:16.280 --> 01:39:17.586
That's a talent.

01:39:20.160 --> 01:39:26.188
But... probably for the first time,
they got the story right.

01:39:27.040 --> 01:39:28.869
What are you saying?

01:39:29.840 --> 01:39:35.026
I'm saying, "Truth is the only
safe ground to stand upon."

01:39:37.960 --> 01:39:41.985
I was on that balcony...
ready to let go.

01:39:45.360 --> 01:39:48.942
I had to make the decision to live.

01:39:50.320 --> 01:39:54.580
I had to make the decision
to stop being a victim,

01:39:54.680 --> 01:39:58.182
to stop trying to be somebody
I knew I wasn't.

01:40:01.320 --> 01:40:05.982
I needed to know what was
worth saving about me.

01:40:07.480 --> 01:40:13.380
And the truth is, that fantasy girl
you see on the posters,

01:40:13.480 --> 01:40:16.584
she did go over the balcony.

01:40:17.960 --> 01:40:21.269
And the real Noni Jean
got pulled back up.

01:40:25.640 --> 01:40:28.100
I'm getting some help now.

01:40:28.200 --> 01:40:31.144
And it's helping me to get to know her.

01:40:32.040 --> 01:40:35.223
She still has some issues, but...

01:40:36.120 --> 01:40:37.980
- ...I like her.
- You know what?

01:40:38.080 --> 01:40:42.060
Maybe, as we get to know her,
maybe we'll like her, too.

01:40:42.160 --> 01:40:44.866
That was a lot to admit, Noni.

01:40:46.120 --> 01:40:48.063
Good luck. Thank you.

01:40:48.840 --> 01:40:50.021
Thanks, Don.

01:40:51.720 --> 01:40:52.867
Hey, Pop?

01:40:59.440 --> 01:41:03.500
Remember when I was a kid and you'd
tell me about the people you saved,

01:41:03.600 --> 01:41:06.067
and all the bad guys you put away?

01:41:08.320 --> 01:41:10.627
Everything was so simple.

01:41:12.320 --> 01:41:14.229
You were like Superman to me.

01:41:15.840 --> 01:41:17.900
All I wanted was to be just like you.

01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:22.788
Son, all I ever wanted
was for things to be better for you.

01:41:25.040 --> 01:41:30.067
Yeah, but better for me might not...
have anything to do with my career.

01:41:31.720 --> 01:41:35.980
Are you saying you don't want
to be a bitter, heartbroken man?

01:41:36.080 --> 01:41:38.751
Don't you mean,
"old, bitter, heartbroken man"?

01:42:03.880 --> 01:42:05.820
Noni.

01:42:05.920 --> 01:42:07.306
Welcome back!

01:42:09.720 --> 01:42:11.470
Good to have you back.

01:42:53.400 --> 01:42:56.100
Brixton has gotten so bad.

01:42:56.200 --> 01:42:58.940
They carry guns like mobile phones now.

01:43:00.040 --> 01:43:02.420
It's good for these kids to see you.

01:43:02.520 --> 01:43:05.066
Let them see that they can make it out.

01:43:07.080 --> 01:43:09.069
Your mom called.

01:43:11.240 --> 01:43:14.740
She want you to tackle me
before I get to the stage?

01:43:14.840 --> 01:43:17.386
No, she wants to know how you're doing.

01:43:21.400 --> 01:43:25.700
You know, it wasn't a monster
who dragged you into my shop.

01:43:25.800 --> 01:43:27.580
It was a desperate mom

01:43:27.680 --> 01:43:30.940
who seemed like she'd do anything
to make her kid's life better.

01:43:32.320 --> 01:43:34.787
- It's time.
- OK!

01:43:39.560 --> 01:43:41.025
Go on.

01:43:41.960 --> 01:43:43.186
Go, baby.

01:43:51.760 --> 01:43:54.101
You can tell her I'm scared.

01:43:58.360 --> 01:44:00.500
All right. We're ready for Noni.

01:44:00.600 --> 01:44:02.190
All yours.

01:44:12.760 --> 01:44:15.101
What are you doing here?

01:44:16.160 --> 01:44:18.342
Change of plans.

01:44:20.920 --> 01:44:23.466
You... got on a plane.

01:44:24.160 --> 01:44:27.380
Yeah, well, it wasn't quite
as memorable as my first time,

01:44:27.480 --> 01:44:30.260
- but they gave me snacks.
- You have to get to stage.

01:44:30.360 --> 01:44:32.460
- What's going on?
- I have to...

01:44:32.560 --> 01:44:34.424
I love you.

01:44:38.280 --> 01:44:40.260
And I'm not taking it back this time.

01:44:40.360 --> 01:44:42.420
We need Noni up here now!

01:44:42.520 --> 01:44:45.820
I'm sorry. We have to go.

01:44:45.920 --> 01:44:50.900
Noni! Noni! Noni!

01:44:58.360 --> 01:45:00.700
Thank you! Cheers!

01:45:00.800 --> 01:45:03.460
It's so good to be home.

01:45:05.840 --> 01:45:07.305
Cheers!

01:45:09.840 --> 01:45:14.220
They asked me to sing
Nina Simone's "Blackbird."

01:45:15.320 --> 01:45:18.182
But I wrote this song.

01:45:19.680 --> 01:45:21.464
I hope you like it.

01:45:23.520 --> 01:45:26.686
We love you, Noni!

01:45:29.920 --> 01:45:35.380
<i>Ooh</i>

01:45:35.480 --> 01:45:38.470
<i>Ah, yeah</i>

01:45:39.920 --> 01:45:43.260
<i>As I dive in</i>

01:45:43.360 --> 01:45:46.828
<i>Without my wings</i>

01:45:47.600 --> 01:45:49.780
<i>At the speed of light</i>

01:45:49.880 --> 01:45:54.030
<i>I'm flying to my end</i>

01:45:55.960 --> 01:45:58.780
<i>As I fall</i>

01:45:58.880 --> 01:46:02.951
<i>Without my wings</i>

01:46:03.560 --> 01:46:06.020
<i>Humming the last song</i>

01:46:06.120 --> 01:46:10.623
<i>The blackbird will sing</i>

01:46:12.640 --> 01:46:16.820
<i>I'm free at last, free from you</i>

01:46:16.920 --> 01:46:20.940
<i>Free from the past, freedom at last</i>

01:46:21.040 --> 01:46:26.271
<i>What is life, other than a cage to me?</i>

01:46:27.640 --> 01:46:29.902
<i>Blackbird</i>

01:46:31.480 --> 01:46:33.548
<i>Oh, Blackbird</i>

01:46:35.520 --> 01:46:38.430
<i>Blackbird</i>

01:46:39.400 --> 01:46:43.260
<i>Oh, Blackbird</i>

01:46:43.360 --> 01:46:47.200
<i>Now I rise</i>

01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:51.580
<i>As the phoenix escapes from me</i>

01:46:51.680 --> 01:46:55.260
<i>Through the fire, through the flames</i>

01:46:55.360 --> 01:47:00.580
<i>Making ashes out of me</i>

01:47:00.680 --> 01:47:05.180
<i>I'm free at last, free from you</i>

01:47:05.280 --> 01:47:09.180
<i>Free from the past, freedom at last</i>

01:47:09.280 --> 01:47:15.262
<i>What is life, other than a cage to me?</i>

01:47:16.800 --> 01:47:20.950
<i>I'm free at last, free from you</i>

01:47:23.080 --> 01:47:25.220
<i>Free from the past, freedom at last</i>

01:47:25.320 --> 01:47:31.348
<i>What is life, other than a cage to me?</i>

01:47:31.640 --> 01:47:33.822
<i>Blackbird</i>

01:47:34.840 --> 01:47:39.900
<i>Oh, Blackbird</i>

01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:42.068
<i>Blackbird</i>

01:47:42.880 --> 01:47:47.540
<i>Sing one last song for me</i>

01:47:47.640 --> 01:47:50.346
<i>Blackbird</i>

01:47:50.480 --> 01:47:55.580
<i>Oh, Blackbird</i>

01:47:55.680 --> 01:47:56.980
<i>Blackbird</i>

01:47:57.080 --> 01:47:58.900
<i>Sing</i>

01:47:59.000 --> 01:48:05.142
<i>One last song for me</i>

01:48:35.160 --> 01:48:37.069
I love you, too.

01:48:45.600 --> 01:48:47.748
Hey, don't go anywhere, OK?
