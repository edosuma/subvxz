00:45.212 --> 00:47.965
<i>I was 28 years old when I died.</i>

01:18.787 --> 01:21.582
<i>My life started
in the Fifth Wards in Houston.</i>

01:21.582 --> 01:24.668
<i>Those were some of the toughest streets
in all of Texas.</i>

01:25.919 --> 01:27.171
Come on down.

01:28.130 --> 01:30.299
<i>Nothing ever came easy.</i>

01:30.299 --> 01:32.009
<i>Every day was a fight.</i>

01:55.866 --> 01:56.867
Oh, Lord.

02:06.919 --> 02:09.045
We'll have electric
soon as I can manage it.

02:19.681 --> 02:20.516
Gloria.

02:21.475 --> 02:22.309
Mary.

02:23.644 --> 02:25.354
Here you go, Roy.

02:26.647 --> 02:27.773
And George.

02:33.153 --> 02:35.864
Thank God for the food first, y'all.

02:37.491 --> 02:38.617
Bow your heads.

02:40.619 --> 02:43.705
Heavenly Father, thank you for this food.

02:43.705 --> 02:46.542
You know exactly what this family needs.

02:47.167 --> 02:50.087
The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want.

02:50.087 --> 02:51.880
- Amen.
- Amen.

02:58.178 --> 03:01.598
I'm so hungry, I could eat this table.

03:08.105 --> 03:09.231
Thank you, Mary.

03:09.898 --> 03:11.859
<i>Mary always saw the good in me.</i>

03:12.901 --> 03:14.278
<i>I loved her for that.</i>

03:29.543 --> 03:30.544
Listen.

03:32.796 --> 03:35.299
I'll be going to work all day tomorrow,

03:36.091 --> 03:39.428
so you follow Gloria to your new school
in the morning. You hear?

03:42.181 --> 03:46.476
If you get held back another year,
you won't ever catch back up.

03:48.937 --> 03:51.899
So promise me you won't fight.

03:54.401 --> 03:55.861
I promise.

04:22.554 --> 04:25.265
- Good morning, class.
- Good morning.

04:25.265 --> 04:27.768
Everyone turn to Page 16 in your books.

04:31.688 --> 04:33.357
Who wants to read out loud?

04:53.418 --> 04:55.796
Jason, take us away.

04:56.964 --> 04:59.508
"Texas is called the Lone Star State..."

05:24.491 --> 05:26.285
What you looking at, Foreman?

05:27.744 --> 05:28.996
Nothing.

05:28.996 --> 05:31.623
What's wrong?
Can't you even afford a piece of bread?

05:33.876 --> 05:36.170
How about this nasty skin?

05:36.795 --> 05:37.713
You want it?

05:41.341 --> 05:42.176
Go get it.

05:43.886 --> 05:46.763
George should change his name
from Foreman to "Poor-man."

05:48.140 --> 05:49.766
It's Foreman.

05:50.642 --> 05:53.145
What's that, Poor-man?

05:58.317 --> 05:59.151
What?

06:02.487 --> 06:05.532
What's my name now, fool?
Say it! Say my name!

06:14.249 --> 06:16.793
<i>Anger was my answer to everything.</i>

06:19.463 --> 06:21.798
<i>And I couldn't stop myself from fighting.</i>

06:22.925 --> 06:25.010
<i>It was the only thing I did well.</i>

07:41.837 --> 07:43.088
Excuse me, sir.

07:44.882 --> 07:46.008
Hey!

07:48.635 --> 07:49.928
- No!
- Get down.

07:49.928 --> 07:51.388
Hold his hands, man.

07:51.388 --> 07:52.472
His wallet.

07:54.558 --> 07:55.642
Surprise, boys.

07:56.768 --> 07:58.478
Been busy around here, huh?

08:02.608 --> 08:04.443
Police! Stop right there!

08:31.220 --> 08:33.304
They've gotta be somewhere around here.

08:42.231 --> 08:43.232
Come on, Butch.

08:45.192 --> 08:47.444
Someone said they saw him over there.

08:49.112 --> 08:51.698
- Let me know what you see.
- Come on, boy. Find him.

08:53.033 --> 08:54.117
Find him.

08:54.117 --> 08:56.119
Let's do it, boy. Go.

09:00.249 --> 09:01.250
You got something?

09:02.209 --> 09:03.418
Find him, boy.

09:03.418 --> 09:05.045
All right. Find him.

09:11.260 --> 09:13.220
We got you. Find him!

09:18.559 --> 09:20.894
- Come on, boy.
- Try the next block over.

09:21.895 --> 09:22.896
Come on, boy.

09:26.024 --> 09:28.527
Let's go. He can't have gotten far.

09:44.918 --> 09:47.880
<i>If you left school
and you're between 16 and 22,</i>

09:47.880 --> 09:52.009
<i>Job Corps will teach you the skills
that can help you get a good job.</i>

09:52.009 --> 09:54.720
<i>In Job Corps,
you live at a Job Corps center,</i>

09:54.720 --> 09:56.847
<i>get free medical and dental care,</i>

09:56.847 --> 10:00.976
<i>clean clothes, your own bed to sleep in,
three square meals a day.</i>

10:00.976 --> 10:03.187
<i>You even get paid while you're learning.</i>

10:03.187 --> 10:06.106
<i>Just for once, give yourself a chance.</i>

10:07.941 --> 10:09.610
It's called the Job Corps.

10:14.531 --> 10:18.035
You get an education and training,
so you can get a job.

10:18.660 --> 10:20.621
They pay you a little each month too.

10:23.624 --> 10:25.375
And where will they send you?

10:26.835 --> 10:27.836
I don't know.

10:28.795 --> 10:31.089
Wherever they want, I guess.

10:43.227 --> 10:44.228
Look at me.

10:45.437 --> 10:47.773
You've got more inside
than what you're showing.

10:49.191 --> 10:50.275
I know it, Mom.

10:54.780 --> 10:56.448
You wanna do this Job Corps?

10:58.033 --> 10:59.034
Yes.

10:59.034 --> 11:01.119
Then do it right, George.

11:02.246 --> 11:04.623
Don't come running back home
'cause you're missing me.

11:05.999 --> 11:08.001
Finish what you start this time.

11:11.004 --> 11:12.005
I will.

11:20.806 --> 11:24.268
We will teach you job skills.
We will give you training.

11:24.268 --> 11:27.145
We will teach you respect for yourself,
as well as for others.

11:27.145 --> 11:30.274
We will show you a way forward,
no matter your past.

11:30.274 --> 11:31.358
Come on, son.

11:32.025 --> 11:35.404
Welcome to the Job Corps,
the start of your now-bright future.

11:35.404 --> 11:36.530
Here's your linens.

11:36.530 --> 11:37.906
Got a name, big guy?

11:38.532 --> 11:40.450
Yeah, I got a name.

11:40.450 --> 11:42.202
George Foreman.

11:42.202 --> 11:44.329
Barracks are gonna be
in the southwest corner.

11:44.329 --> 11:45.330
Lights out at 10.

11:45.330 --> 11:48.750
No drinking, no smoking,
no cursing, no women, no fighting.

11:50.961 --> 11:53.547
- Do y'all feed us here?
- Three meals a day at the chow hall.

11:53.547 --> 11:56.091
Served by the one and only Mrs. Moon.

12:14.318 --> 12:15.903
It's just a bed, man.

13:17.673 --> 13:18.841
Turn that off.

13:28.642 --> 13:31.061
- Got something against music?
- Maybe I do.

13:32.563 --> 13:34.064
Are you always this pissed off?

13:34.064 --> 13:35.649
When I'm trying to study.

13:51.290 --> 13:53.292
Now I know why you're here.

13:56.003 --> 14:00.048
I'm here
because I've got unrealized potential.

14:00.757 --> 14:02.134
That's according to my old man.

14:02.134 --> 14:05.012
He said, "Don't come home
until you start realizing it."

14:07.848 --> 14:11.351
Let's go challenge C-dorm
to a game, huh? What do you say?

14:15.105 --> 14:17.858
Guess I'll just hit the chow hall.

14:18.901 --> 14:19.902
Alone.

14:24.198 --> 14:25.324
Now you're talking.

14:32.581 --> 14:34.541
You probably just left them
in the locker room.

14:34.541 --> 14:37.586
No. Somebody stole them.

14:38.295 --> 14:39.838
You gotta calm down, man.

14:39.838 --> 14:44.885
Look, why don't we just report it
to the office right after we eat, okay?

14:48.347 --> 14:50.682
You got me to thank for those brownies.

14:50.682 --> 14:53.310
Why is that? I don't see no apron on you.

14:53.936 --> 14:56.939
Yeah, well, they realized
I'm a whiz with numbers.

14:56.939 --> 15:00.150
So they got me checking
over the order for the whole cafeteria.

15:00.150 --> 15:01.610
Well, I spotted something.

15:01.610 --> 15:05.113
A unit of brownies costs less
than a unit of beans.

15:05.739 --> 15:06.823
So what?

15:06.823 --> 15:10.160
"So what?" So I switched a few numbers
on the weekly ordering sheet.

15:10.160 --> 15:13.705
And under my new cost-cutting plans,
we got a whole lot more brownies.

15:15.082 --> 15:17.376
And a whole lot of less gas.

15:25.592 --> 15:26.426
What?

15:55.914 --> 15:56.915
What are you doing?

16:03.213 --> 16:04.214
Open up!

16:05.048 --> 16:05.883
Open up!

16:11.054 --> 16:13.807
- Take my shoes? You take my shoes?
- No! Please, no!

16:13.807 --> 16:16.268
Give me them! You gonna steal my shoes?

16:16.894 --> 16:18.270
- My mama gave me them shoes!
- No!

16:18.270 --> 16:20.564
What do you think you're doing, corpsman?

16:20.564 --> 16:23.483
- Don't drop me!
- Let go of him! Stop it, stop it!

16:24.067 --> 16:25.611
Go on out of here. Get out of here.

16:32.201 --> 16:33.493
Where you think you're going?

16:36.580 --> 16:37.998
Is that your artwork?

16:42.920 --> 16:44.171
Let's walk and talk.

16:51.512 --> 16:53.096
Mr. Broadus.

16:53.096 --> 16:55.557
That was federal property
you destroyed back there.

16:55.557 --> 16:57.017
I only got two choices.

16:57.017 --> 16:59.436
Either I send you to prison,
or I send you home.

16:59.436 --> 17:01.146
That boy stole my shoes.

17:01.730 --> 17:03.941
My mama worked hard to give me those.

17:03.941 --> 17:06.527
- Where's all that rage coming from?
- I don't have any rage.

17:07.986 --> 17:08.987
Get in the car.

17:15.077 --> 17:16.787
In the time you've been here,

17:16.787 --> 17:19.039
you punched out three corpsmen...

17:19.873 --> 17:21.541
and one innocent door.

17:21.541 --> 17:22.917
They disrespected me.

17:22.917 --> 17:24.127
The door too?

17:30.592 --> 17:32.052
You got money for a bus ticket?

17:36.056 --> 17:36.890
No.

17:41.144 --> 17:42.145
Here you go.

18:01.498 --> 18:03.667
I can't go home, Mr. Broadus.

18:09.506 --> 18:10.507
I can't.

18:12.301 --> 18:13.385
This place...

18:15.304 --> 18:16.555
it's all I have.

18:20.767 --> 18:21.977
Please?

18:57.137 --> 18:58.138
You ever box?

19:02.476 --> 19:03.810
Just street fights.

19:03.810 --> 19:06.605
I'm talking about boxing, not fighting.

19:07.314 --> 19:08.357
It's a sport.

19:09.233 --> 19:10.442
With rules.

19:12.819 --> 19:14.530
I heard it on the radio.

19:17.658 --> 19:18.659
I teach it.

19:22.204 --> 19:23.664
You're big enough and ugly enough.

19:24.706 --> 19:26.208
You wanna learn it?

19:28.919 --> 19:29.920
Yes, sir.

19:32.047 --> 19:33.590
Don't make me regret this.

19:41.473 --> 19:43.767
George, this is Royce.

19:43.767 --> 19:45.853
He's gonna be your opponent today.

19:46.562 --> 19:49.022
Don't worry, big man. I'll be gentle.

19:49.898 --> 19:52.985
That's just a sign
of sportsmanship before you fight.

19:53.569 --> 19:55.571
To show that you're not here
to kill each other.

19:55.571 --> 19:57.281
You're just two athletes

19:57.281 --> 19:59.491
trying to find out
who's best at the sport.

20:00.325 --> 20:01.743
So to do that...

20:02.494 --> 20:05.914
boxers touch gloves, like this:

20:05.914 --> 20:07.916
All right? Let's go.

20:07.916 --> 20:10.002
Let's get on up there.
Let me see what you got.

20:28.687 --> 20:32.441
- All right, Royce, show him what's what.
- When I say "time," you come out fighting.

20:37.529 --> 20:40.199
Anyone want action? Want action, huh?

20:41.200 --> 20:42.534
Leroy Jackson, huh?

20:44.953 --> 20:46.371
Time!

20:50.667 --> 20:52.085
Get him, Royce! Get him!

20:58.300 --> 20:59.343
Be still!

21:12.022 --> 21:13.315
Hit him, George.

21:16.068 --> 21:17.110
Move your feet, George.

21:17.110 --> 21:20.614
You keep standing there like a statue
and a pigeon is gonna crap on you.

21:27.913 --> 21:28.747
Get up.

21:30.582 --> 21:33.877
Get out of that ring. Get out that ring.
Ain't no reason to be in that ring.

21:36.797 --> 21:38.090
Attaboy, Royce!

21:49.601 --> 21:52.479
He was lucky! That's all he was.

22:04.157 --> 22:06.118
Listen, son.
I know that's not what you were--

22:06.118 --> 22:07.661
I'm not your son.

22:07.661 --> 22:08.996
That's a good thing too.

22:08.996 --> 22:11.206
I wouldn't want
no son of mine calling it luck,

22:11.206 --> 22:12.916
when he got whupped fair and square.

22:12.916 --> 22:15.711
They all laughing at me because of you.

22:15.711 --> 22:17.838
What do you care about what they think?

22:17.838 --> 22:20.299
Six months ago,
Royce didn't know any more than you do.

22:21.133 --> 22:22.134
I taught him.

22:23.552 --> 22:24.761
I can teach you too.

22:29.766 --> 22:32.311
You got a punch, I'll tell you that.

22:32.311 --> 22:33.896
But that's just about all you got.

22:35.856 --> 22:36.690
There you go.

22:39.902 --> 22:41.486
We gotta get you a jab.

22:47.659 --> 22:49.286
We gotta get you some footwork.

22:50.287 --> 22:52.039
We're gonna start out with a punch.

22:52.789 --> 22:55.209
All right? Throw a punch.

22:59.254 --> 23:01.089
Now throw the other one.

23:10.807 --> 23:12.601
See what I just did there?

23:12.601 --> 23:15.896
The mind controls the body,
not the other way around.

23:16.939 --> 23:20.192
In every battle,
the greatest foe that we will combat...

23:21.860 --> 23:23.237
is in here.

23:24.488 --> 23:27.324
You were making fun of Royce
when he was dancing around, wasn't you?

23:27.324 --> 23:29.326
- He was showing off.
- No, he wasn't.

23:29.826 --> 23:32.329
He was trying to force you to go
where he needed you to go,

23:32.329 --> 23:34.873
so he could deliver that punch
that he was setting up.

23:35.749 --> 23:40.045
And he was studying the ring too,
the soft spots, the loose boards.

23:40.629 --> 23:44.132
Not just about punching, George.
It's about thinking.

23:45.259 --> 23:48.679
All right.
Step forward with that left foot.

23:49.930 --> 23:51.765
Now slide that right foot.

23:52.808 --> 23:54.935
Not straight ahead, off to the side.

23:55.894 --> 23:56.728
Put it back.

23:58.522 --> 24:01.275
Here we go. Step forward.

24:02.568 --> 24:03.402
Step back.

24:04.695 --> 24:06.071
Step left.

24:06.989 --> 24:08.198
Step right.

24:09.950 --> 24:11.451
Cut me off. I'm cutting you off.

24:12.786 --> 24:13.787
Cut me off, cut me off.

24:14.830 --> 24:16.039
Good.

24:42.274 --> 24:43.275
Come on.

24:44.026 --> 24:45.944
Come on. Come on.

24:53.785 --> 24:55.954
- Oh, I've seen a woman.
- A woman?

24:55.954 --> 24:58.665
George! Mary, get your brothers in here.

24:58.665 --> 25:00.959
Sonny, Roy, George is on the phone.

25:00.959 --> 25:03.712
- Is that my brother?
- No, no. That's our brother, boy.

25:04.296 --> 25:05.881
Yes, everybody's here.

25:06.423 --> 25:07.591
- Hey, George.
- Hey there.

25:07.591 --> 25:09.426
- We miss you.
- Hi.

25:12.221 --> 25:15.098
- Well, how are you?
- Setting the world on fire.

25:15.098 --> 25:17.142
They raised me 25 cents an hour at work.

25:17.142 --> 25:19.186
Oh, far out.

25:19.186 --> 25:20.938
Out? Out where?

25:20.938 --> 25:24.107
Oh, no. That's just something
they say out here in California.

25:24.107 --> 25:26.026
You can't come back to Texas
talking like that.

25:31.114 --> 25:33.909
- I'm going to the gym a lot.
- Basketball?

25:33.909 --> 25:37.162
<i>No, no. I found something better.</i>

25:37.162 --> 25:39.164
I'm learning how to box.

25:39.164 --> 25:41.416
Please don't tell me
you're fighting again.

25:41.416 --> 25:44.253
- No, I'm not fighting.
- Then what do you call it, George?

25:44.253 --> 25:47.214
It's boxing. It's a sport with rules.

25:47.214 --> 25:48.507
And I'm good at it.

25:48.507 --> 25:50.801
God knows I don't want you to be fighting.

25:50.801 --> 25:53.345
God? What's God got to do
with anything, Mama?

25:53.345 --> 25:55.264
Don't tell me you gone so far from home,

25:55.264 --> 25:57.432
you don't know
what God's gotta do with your life.

25:57.432 --> 26:00.185
- Mama, I'm just trying-- Mama?
<i>- Please deposit 10 cents.</i>

26:00.185 --> 26:01.144
Mama?

26:01.770 --> 26:03.647
- George?
<i>- Please deposit 10 cents.</i>

26:04.523 --> 26:07.860
<i>Please deposit 10 cents
for the next minute.</i>

26:08.902 --> 26:11.071
<i>Please deposit 10 cents.</i>

26:19.746 --> 26:21.915
Come on, Royce, put him down.

26:21.915 --> 26:24.334
All right, George. You got this.

26:24.334 --> 26:25.294
Time!

26:28.922 --> 26:31.675
Come on, cut him off! Cut him off!

26:46.106 --> 26:47.357
Oh, yeah!

26:49.818 --> 26:51.320
That's my bunkmate.

27:02.080 --> 27:03.665
I may be a little late tonight.

27:03.665 --> 27:04.958
I know I promised.

27:05.792 --> 27:06.793
I will try.

27:12.382 --> 27:14.927
My wife thinks
I give up too much time to this place.

27:16.136 --> 27:18.555
- You boxed?
- I went professional.

27:19.181 --> 27:21.350
Won my first 24 fights.

27:22.184 --> 27:23.185
And then what?

27:23.185 --> 27:26.730
Unfortunately,
I had to trade one uniform for another.

27:27.272 --> 27:31.068
Hey, I see you're reading the <i>Boxing News.</i>

27:31.068 --> 27:33.278
- Yeah.
- You an aficionado now?

27:33.278 --> 27:35.489
- I was looking at Joe Frazier.
- Yeah?

27:35.489 --> 27:36.990
He's real good.

27:37.950 --> 27:40.744
Yeah, I wouldn't mind all this
that he's got.

27:45.582 --> 27:47.709
I wanna be
the heavyweight champion of the world.

27:50.254 --> 27:52.297
Slow down, George. Slow down.

27:52.297 --> 27:54.591
I can't slow down. I gotta speed up.

27:54.591 --> 27:57.970
- You said you can get me some fights.
- I can, and I will.

27:57.970 --> 27:58.971
Okay.

27:59.513 --> 28:02.057
But first, you gotta win some tournaments.

28:02.057 --> 28:05.143
Then we can take aim at the Golden Gloves.

28:05.143 --> 28:08.438
And after that,
we can set our sights on the Olympics.

28:08.438 --> 28:09.731
Well, when are they?

28:10.566 --> 28:12.484
Next summer, Mexico City.

28:12.484 --> 28:15.445
But we're gonna wait
for the one after that.

28:15.445 --> 28:18.574
That gives you five years
to train and develop.

28:18.574 --> 28:20.242
Five years?

28:20.242 --> 28:21.952
I'll be a old man.

28:21.952 --> 28:23.287
Listen to me, George.

28:23.287 --> 28:25.831
You got a punch like I've never seen.

28:25.831 --> 28:29.334
But even if you trained harder
than any man has ever trained,

28:29.334 --> 28:33.380
there is no way that you can make it
to the Olympics next year.

28:39.386 --> 28:43.098
<i>The Russians are dominating here
at the Olympics in Mexico City,</i>

28:43.098 --> 28:45.559
<i>three gold medals
to just one for the U.S. team.</i>

28:46.894 --> 28:49.229
<i>The Russians have saved
their best for last.</i>

28:49.229 --> 28:52.691
<i>The legendary Jonas Čepulis
has won 203 fights.</i>

28:53.317 --> 28:54.318
Come on, George.

28:56.361 --> 28:59.072
<i>America's final hope,
19-year-old George Foreman,</i>

28:59.072 --> 29:01.366
<i>has been fighting for only one year.</i>

29:02.701 --> 29:04.995
<i>He would seem to have no chance
at winning gold.</i>

29:04.995 --> 29:06.371
Come on.

29:06.997 --> 29:10.584
<i>I don't think anyone has ever seen
a bigger mismatch in the Olympic ring.</i>

29:11.084 --> 29:14.338
<i>What Foreman's being asked
to do today is impossible.</i>

29:15.589 --> 29:19.384
<i>The big Russian's setting the tone early,
giving the young rookie a boxing lesson.</i>

29:19.384 --> 29:21.053
Come on, wake up.

29:23.013 --> 29:24.348
Hit him now. Get him now.

29:27.267 --> 29:28.393
Wake up.

29:34.733 --> 29:36.318
<i>Big left hand from George Foreman.</i>

29:36.944 --> 29:37.778
You see that?

29:40.280 --> 29:42.783
Yeah! Yes!

29:42.783 --> 29:46.078
<i>The Fighting Corpsman is turning
the tables on Čepulis.</i>

29:46.870 --> 29:50.123
<i>Foreman pouring it on now, landing bombs.</i>

29:50.123 --> 29:52.668
<i>Čepulis looks like
he's in really bad shape.</i>

30:00.884 --> 30:03.762
- Stop, stop! That's it!
<i>- The ref has stopped the fight!</i>

30:05.097 --> 30:08.851
<i>Nineteen-year-old George Foreman has
won the gold medal in a stunning upset.</i>

30:11.645 --> 30:12.688
Yeah!

30:12.688 --> 30:15.107
- He won the gold medal.
- Look at him.

30:18.193 --> 30:19.319
God help him.

30:28.537 --> 30:43.552
<i>Foreman! Foreman! Foreman!</i>

31:07.034 --> 31:09.369
- Hey, George.
- Hey, what's going on, brother?

31:13.624 --> 31:14.458
Hey, Tuck.

31:16.168 --> 31:19.254
- Hey, brother. What's going on?
- What's up, George?

31:19.254 --> 31:20.172
Hey.

31:23.008 --> 31:24.885
You can go ahead and touch it, man.

31:24.885 --> 31:26.220
It's heavy though.

31:27.012 --> 31:29.431
Yeah, I bet it's heavy, all right.

31:31.058 --> 31:32.684
What's that 'posed to mean?

31:33.435 --> 31:38.524
Man, I don't see how you can hold
that American flag all up high like you do

31:39.024 --> 31:41.693
when our brothers, shoot, our brothers,

31:42.402 --> 31:45.405
they was doing their thing over there.

31:51.703 --> 31:54.206
They was standing up for all us back here.

31:54.206 --> 31:55.749
And what were you doing?

31:55.749 --> 31:58.585
Standing up for a country
that don't love you back.

31:59.711 --> 32:00.754
That's heavy.

32:15.394 --> 32:16.979
You gotta let this go.

32:16.979 --> 32:20.190
If anybody ever talk to me
about that flag again,

32:20.190 --> 32:22.192
they not gonna get away with it.

32:22.192 --> 32:24.111
They acting like I'm some kind of sellout.

32:25.529 --> 32:27.823
Let me make you something to eat.
Anything you want.

32:27.823 --> 32:28.907
I'm not hungry.

32:29.992 --> 32:33.954
Let the Lord take me now.
I never thought I'd hear that from you.

32:47.301 --> 32:49.928
You left here with nothing to your name,

32:49.928 --> 32:51.972
and you came back with gold.

32:52.598 --> 32:55.184
Then how come
all anybody wanna talk about is the flag?

32:56.977 --> 32:58.437
You know what I'm gonna do?

32:58.437 --> 33:01.148
I'm gonna win the championship belt.

33:01.148 --> 33:04.318
- And they'll respect me then.
- You gonna keep fighting?

33:05.652 --> 33:06.904
You gonna get hurt.

33:06.904 --> 33:09.698
Didn't you watch me? They don't hurt me.

33:10.407 --> 33:11.533
I hurt them.

33:11.533 --> 33:15.120
And that's all you wanna do
with your life, hurt people?

33:17.789 --> 33:19.458
You are better than this.

33:19.458 --> 33:20.792
I got a plan, Mama.

33:21.752 --> 33:23.670
And I need you to believe in it.

34:05.420 --> 34:07.172
I heard he's not so bad.

34:11.342 --> 34:12.344
Right on.

34:13.428 --> 34:14.471
And you are?

34:15.347 --> 34:18.725
- Paula.
<i>- Last call for Flight 275 to Los Angeles.</i>

34:18.725 --> 34:21.228
That's me. Nice meeting you, George.

34:21.228 --> 34:23.230
Wait. Oh, that's not fair.

34:24.231 --> 34:27.025
- You live here in Oakland?
- Yes, I do.

34:27.025 --> 34:29.027
So that means you'll be coming back.

34:29.027 --> 34:30.821
Yeah, I'm moving here.

34:30.821 --> 34:33.949
I'm gonna be training,
but when I'm not, you know,

34:34.449 --> 34:36.243
I could go outside sometimes.

34:36.243 --> 34:38.829
Your footwork is better
than your pickup game, George.

34:39.788 --> 34:41.581
Yeah, I can't argue that.

34:41.581 --> 34:44.877
Tell me something about yourself. Anything.

34:46.210 --> 34:47.670
- Anything?
- Yeah.

34:51.800 --> 34:53.719
I can type a hundred words a minute.

34:55.219 --> 34:57.097
I can't even talk that fast.

35:04.271 --> 35:05.689
Can I see you again?

35:11.195 --> 35:13.238
Go ahead and write your phone number down.

35:15.699 --> 35:18.202
I'm the one 'posed to be asking for yours.

35:18.202 --> 35:21.330
George, do I look like the kind of woman
that stands around by the phone?

35:38.055 --> 35:40.516
No, ma'am. You do not.

35:40.516 --> 35:43.560
Well, hold on.
Are you sure we need these guys?

35:43.560 --> 35:45.395
Pro game's a racket.

35:45.395 --> 35:47.356
These guys could take us
where we need to go.

35:52.569 --> 35:57.616
<i>I'm smelling me some new blood, new blood</i>

35:59.368 --> 36:01.537
Hey. Dick Sadler.

36:01.537 --> 36:03.664
He gonna be your trainer
and your promoter.

36:04.581 --> 36:05.999
This is Archie Moore,

36:05.999 --> 36:08.669
the former light-heavyweight champion
of the world.

36:08.669 --> 36:10.754
He gonna teach you everything
that he done learned.

36:10.754 --> 36:12.965
If I like what I see.

36:17.928 --> 36:19.513
Hey, Sonny. I'm such a big fan.

36:20.722 --> 36:21.890
Can I get your autograph?

36:23.183 --> 36:24.726
- Hey, that's--
- Yeah, it's--

36:24.726 --> 36:25.978
Sonny Liston.

36:26.478 --> 36:28.647
We make champions around here, son.

36:29.439 --> 36:32.776
What you're setting out to do
is beyond your imagination.

36:34.778 --> 36:37.281
The morning you wake up
to fight for that championship,

36:37.281 --> 36:40.576
the air taste different,
the sun look different.

36:40.576 --> 36:44.246
Only two men on this whole earth matter
and you're one of them.

36:44.246 --> 36:47.624
The other, if you make it that far,

36:47.624 --> 36:49.084
is Joe Frazier.

37:08.145 --> 37:11.315
We gonna name this bag Joe Frazier.

37:12.482 --> 37:15.652
If you hit him in the solar plexus,
you gonna cut off his breathing.

37:15.652 --> 37:18.655
You hit him in the chin,
you gonna rattle his nerves.

37:18.655 --> 37:21.408
You hit him in the heart,
you gonna make his heartbeat skip.

37:21.408 --> 37:23.410
Every punch, George, power!

37:25.370 --> 37:27.164
<i>- Hello?</i>
- First ring.

37:27.789 --> 37:29.708
- Paula!
- Yes.

37:29.708 --> 37:32.085
I wanna hear the rest of that story
you were starting to tell me.

37:32.794 --> 37:34.004
What story?

37:34.004 --> 37:37.007
About how you can type 100 words a minute.

37:39.718 --> 37:41.011
That story.

37:41.011 --> 37:45.224
George, when are you gonna
ask me a real question?

37:45.224 --> 37:46.350
Like what?

37:47.100 --> 37:48.227
Like...

37:49.019 --> 37:50.687
if I wanna go out on a date.

37:53.649 --> 37:55.067
Pound him, George. Pound him!

38:03.784 --> 38:05.869
You sure you typing real words?

38:05.869 --> 38:07.871
Yeah, that sound like music.

38:24.137 --> 38:26.473
- Knock him out, baby!
- All right, all right.

38:26.473 --> 38:28.016
Keep him there. Keep him there.

38:29.309 --> 38:30.143
Move him, man.

38:34.523 --> 38:36.358
- That's it!
- Yes!

38:41.864 --> 38:44.116
The winner by TKO,

38:44.116 --> 38:47.911
still undefeated, George Foreman!

38:50.914 --> 38:53.208
Do you take this woman to be your wife?

38:53.208 --> 38:54.293
You bet I do.

39:00.215 --> 39:01.592
You may kiss the bride.

39:09.850 --> 39:11.059
Hey, watch this.

39:25.699 --> 39:28.368
- I think you ready.
- Nice punching, big fella.

39:30.662 --> 39:32.623
Frazier won't know what hit him.

39:33.874 --> 39:37.586
<i>Here we are
for the heavyweight championship fight</i>

39:37.586 --> 39:41.423
<i>between Joe Frazier and George Foreman.</i>

39:42.758 --> 39:45.719
<i>Joe Frazier is the heavy favorite tonight.</i>

39:45.719 --> 39:49.556
His best weapon, the left hook, is deadly.

39:49.556 --> 39:52.893
Put Ali on the canvas two years ago,

39:52.893 --> 39:57.189
and if Foreman isn't aware of it,
it could put him on his back,

39:57.189 --> 40:01.151
and maybe even carried
out of the arena on a stretcher.

40:01.151 --> 40:15.374
<i>Frazier! Frazier! Frazier!</i>

40:15.374 --> 40:18.460
This contest is for
the heavyweight championship of the world.

40:18.460 --> 40:21.129
It's governed
by the Jamaican Board of Control...

40:21.129 --> 40:23.799
Nobody giving you a chance to win tonight.

40:25.717 --> 40:26.802
<i>That's good.</i>

40:30.889 --> 40:33.392
<i>But Smokin' Joe ain't like
the others, nah.</i>

40:34.393 --> 40:36.061
He the real deal.

40:37.020 --> 40:40.524
Remember, only two men
on this whole earth matter.

40:41.567 --> 40:42.693
Now go get him.

40:45.112 --> 40:46.363
<i>You're ready, George.</i>

40:47.739 --> 40:50.617
<i>Now, Joe,
he's expecting that you're just a man.</i>

40:51.785 --> 40:54.663
<i>But tonight, you're a beast.</i>

40:55.956 --> 40:57.165
Let him out.

40:59.126 --> 41:01.086
And there's the bell. They're underway.

41:01.086 --> 41:03.630
Oh, big swing and a miss from George.

41:07.176 --> 41:09.261
There's that Joe Frazier left hook.

41:09.261 --> 41:11.763
One more of those could end it.

41:11.763 --> 41:14.391
Stay on him. Watch out for that.
Watch out for that.

41:18.687 --> 41:20.272
Big shot by Foreman.

41:25.277 --> 41:26.862
Oh, and another left hook!

41:26.862 --> 41:28.739
How is he still standing?

41:30.449 --> 41:31.700
There it is.

41:33.535 --> 41:36.788
Frazier's taking some damage.
A real surprise.

41:37.456 --> 41:38.707
That's it. That's it!

41:42.085 --> 41:45.422
Down goes Frazier! Down goes Frazier!

41:45.422 --> 41:47.132
Down goes Frazier!

41:51.303 --> 41:52.763
Joe is slow to get up.

41:53.680 --> 41:57.643
And George Foreman is standing
as poised as can be.

41:57.643 --> 42:01.230
The heavyweight champ
is taking the eight count.

42:02.898 --> 42:04.942
There's the bell for the second round.

42:06.735 --> 42:09.238
But Joe is tough. Joe is game.

42:10.489 --> 42:15.452
And Foreman is all over him again,
just hitting him again and again.

42:20.332 --> 42:21.792
He's down again!

42:21.792 --> 42:23.460
This is hard to believe.

42:24.920 --> 42:26.088
Get off the ropes!

42:26.088 --> 42:29.466
Six, seven, eight.

42:34.012 --> 42:36.598
He's target practice for George Foreman.

42:36.598 --> 42:38.725
Target practice!

42:39.351 --> 42:42.563
- Don't let up.
- How much more can Frazier take?

42:51.530 --> 42:54.449
He's down! He's down again!

42:54.449 --> 42:55.868
And it's over!

42:55.868 --> 42:57.870
It's over! So long!

42:57.870 --> 43:00.205
I've never seen anything like this.

43:01.415 --> 43:06.044
George Foreman is the new
heavyweight champion of the world.

43:15.387 --> 43:18.265
All right.

43:19.099 --> 43:20.100
Yes.

43:37.659 --> 43:39.077
How does it feel to be a winner?

43:39.077 --> 43:41.330
I was determined
to become a winner tonight.

43:41.330 --> 43:43.415
I'd like to thank the press
all over the country

43:43.415 --> 43:45.292
for writing beautiful things about me.

43:45.292 --> 43:48.295
The press has kept my name
in the paper. And...

43:49.171 --> 43:51.465
And it kept me focused.

43:51.465 --> 43:54.968
So, what's the first thing
you'll do as a champion, George?

43:54.968 --> 43:57.346
I'm gonna buy my mama a big house.

44:00.182 --> 44:03.143
Wait a second. Wait-- What is this?

44:03.143 --> 44:06.146
Is that the champ? Is that the champ?

44:07.481 --> 44:10.275
Do you have any idea
what's coming next, George?

44:11.151 --> 44:12.861
A flood of money.

44:12.861 --> 44:15.072
Well, I'm always ready for money.

44:15.906 --> 44:17.241
But my moneyman ain't.

44:20.410 --> 44:22.329
You want me to be your moneyman?

44:22.329 --> 44:23.747
Yeah, I do.

44:24.873 --> 44:26.124
But, Des, man...

44:27.084 --> 44:30.003
I'm gonna need you sharp from now on.

44:38.262 --> 44:40.097
That's what I'm talking about.

44:41.890 --> 44:44.351
It's a long way from the Job Corps.

45:15.007 --> 45:16.592
How'd you get up here?

45:24.683 --> 45:26.310
You don't want me to stay?

46:06.099 --> 46:09.645
<i>Muhammad, there are a lot of people saying</i>

46:09.645 --> 46:12.397
<i>they've never seen as formidable a puncher</i>

46:12.397 --> 46:15.943
<i>as the new champ,
young George Foreman.</i>

46:15.943 --> 46:17.736
<i>Howard, when I think of George Foreman,</i>

46:17.736 --> 46:21.281
<i>I think of the establishment,
the flag-waver.</i>

46:21.281 --> 46:23.116
<i>And I got a new punch for George, Howard,</i>

46:23.116 --> 46:25.410
<i>and I call it the "Ghetto Whopper."</i>

46:25.410 --> 46:27.579
<i>And the reason I call it
the Ghetto Whopper</i>

46:27.579 --> 46:31.667
<i>is because it's thrown in the ghetto
at 3 o'clock in the morning.</i>

46:32.334 --> 46:33.794
<i>You ever seen one of them punches?</i>

46:33.794 --> 46:36.046
<i>Comes out of nowhere,
hits you like a bottle in the head.</i>

46:36.046 --> 46:38.966
<i>Think you'd have to wait
till 3:00 in the morning</i>

46:38.966 --> 46:40.509
<i>to fight George Foreman?</i>

46:40.509 --> 46:42.094
<i>Howard, let it be known.</i>

46:42.094 --> 46:45.514
<i>I will fight George Foreman
anywhere, any time.</i>

46:49.184 --> 46:51.937
- What y'all think? Nice, isn't it?
- Oh, my Lord.

46:51.937 --> 46:54.898
Now, come on.
I wanna show y'all something.

46:56.316 --> 46:57.317
Y'all hear that?

46:58.068 --> 47:00.529
Now, each car has its own personality.

47:01.280 --> 47:02.781
That's why you need five of them?

47:03.532 --> 47:06.618
Five? Wait till you see my garage.

47:07.202 --> 47:09.705
Oh, my Lord.
You've lost your doggone mind.

47:09.705 --> 47:11.373
I wanna show y'all something else.

47:11.957 --> 47:14.168
- All right. You got that other one there?
- Yes, sir.

47:14.168 --> 47:15.085
Okay.

47:16.295 --> 47:17.838
Been on a grill all day for y'all.

47:17.838 --> 47:21.300
My own barbecue sauce.
I took my time on it.

47:21.300 --> 47:24.052
- Okay. That's what I'm talking about.
- Working on this all day.

47:24.761 --> 47:26.388
- Okay
- That looks fantastic.

47:26.388 --> 47:27.848
There she is.

47:28.932 --> 47:31.351
- Give me my birthday baby.
- Your daddy wants you.

47:32.728 --> 47:33.896
- Yeah.
- Go to Daddy.

47:35.272 --> 47:36.273
Yeah.

47:37.649 --> 47:40.277
- Happy birthday.
- How about one for your wife too?

47:43.655 --> 47:46.450
All right. Say hi to everybody.

47:46.450 --> 47:47.951
Say hi to everybody.

47:47.951 --> 47:50.329
- Happy birthday, beautiful.
- I'm gonna give you away.

47:50.329 --> 47:51.622
- Don't give her away.
- I love you.

47:53.999 --> 47:55.417
- All right.
- Bye.

47:56.627 --> 47:58.670
- It's time to eat now.
- Boy.

47:58.670 --> 48:01.924
- You know better.
- Let's thank God for the food first.

48:01.924 --> 48:03.008
God?

48:04.051 --> 48:05.802
I bought the food, Mama.

48:05.802 --> 48:08.180
- Not God.
- Good.

48:08.805 --> 48:10.057
Then you say grace.

48:13.185 --> 48:14.770
I like the way you say it, Mama.

48:16.688 --> 48:19.233
Me and Charles have something
we wanna tell y'all.

48:21.485 --> 48:23.529
- We're having a baby.
- A baby?

48:24.196 --> 48:27.032
Charles, you old dog.
Getting my sister pregnant.

48:27.032 --> 48:29.743
- Look at that.
- Mary, congratulations.

48:29.743 --> 48:31.453
- Thank you.
- It's great.

48:33.455 --> 48:35.666
We'll have me another niece
or nephew running around here.

48:38.794 --> 48:39.628
Hello?

48:43.507 --> 48:45.217
Stop calling this house.

48:49.388 --> 48:51.557
- So, Des...
- Yes, sir.

48:51.557 --> 48:52.975
How's my money doing?

48:52.975 --> 48:57.229
I'm pouring everything
into rock-solid stocks.

48:57.229 --> 48:58.897
I like the sound of that.

48:58.897 --> 49:00.732
"Rock-solid stocks."

49:03.402 --> 49:06.989
You know, Ali sure been talking
a whole bunch of mess on TV,

49:06.989 --> 49:09.157
bragging about which round
he'll knock you out in.

49:11.743 --> 49:13.203
Talk is cheap.

49:13.203 --> 49:16.623
You know what they say about pretty boys
back in the Fifth Wards.

49:16.623 --> 49:18.333
They can't take a punch.

49:18.333 --> 49:19.418
Yes.

49:31.513 --> 49:33.765
I think everybody's ready for dessert.

49:33.765 --> 49:35.267
You should tell me their names,

49:35.267 --> 49:38.270
so I don't have to stand there
holding the phone like a fool.

49:39.396 --> 49:40.564
What are you talking about?

49:40.564 --> 49:42.024
Did you think I didn't know?

49:43.650 --> 49:47.487
- I don't have time for this.
- No, it's me you don't have time for.

49:52.743 --> 49:57.122
How many have there been, George?

50:01.627 --> 50:03.837
You can't even look me in the eye anymore.

50:03.837 --> 50:07.216
Woman, I got a $5 million fight
coming up against Ali.

50:07.216 --> 50:10.594
You think I dropped my life for you,
so that I could play seconds?

50:12.179 --> 50:14.181
I was doing just fine
before you came along.

50:14.181 --> 50:16.475
So you don't like this life now, huh?

50:17.559 --> 50:18.894
I give you everything.

50:18.894 --> 50:20.687
I don't want everything.

50:26.401 --> 50:27.569
I want you.

50:29.404 --> 50:30.489
You have me.

50:33.408 --> 50:34.493
Look at me.

50:45.629 --> 50:46.797
Look at me.

50:59.434 --> 51:00.727
Just like I thought.

51:43.812 --> 51:45.230
Sir. No, no.

51:45.814 --> 51:46.940
- I got it.
- Okay.

51:56.366 --> 51:57.451
Come on, now.

51:57.451 --> 51:59.912
We gonna float like a butterfly,
sting like a bee.

51:59.912 --> 52:02.706
His hands can't hit
what his eyes can't see.

52:02.706 --> 52:04.291
Now you see me. Now you don't.

52:04.291 --> 52:06.502
George thinks he will,
but I know he won't.

52:07.377 --> 52:08.921
Ain't that right, Bundini?

52:08.921 --> 52:12.174
Him hitting Joe Frazier
with these big, long punches.

52:12.174 --> 52:13.842
Boxes like a mummy.

52:14.927 --> 52:18.680
"Come here. Where'd you get?
Oh, you over here."

52:19.431 --> 52:22.059
All of you sportswriters,
all of you suckers,

52:22.059 --> 52:24.520
are gonna regret
making me the underdog.

52:24.520 --> 52:26.104
How you gonna make me the underdog?

52:26.104 --> 52:28.482
Talking about George Foreman
is the new champ.

52:28.482 --> 52:31.693
George Foreman ain't no new champ.
He is the new chump.

52:32.486 --> 52:35.405
And he's holding the belt
that was wrongfully taken from me.

52:35.405 --> 52:37.699
And he can't box. He moves like this.

52:37.699 --> 52:39.785
This how he box. Box like a mummy.

52:40.702 --> 52:42.371
"Coming here for you. I'm--"

52:44.998 --> 52:45.999
George.

52:46.750 --> 52:48.919
We was just talking
about a different fighter.

52:52.673 --> 52:54.633
Your turn, Big George.

52:54.633 --> 52:56.677
Why don't you give us
your side of things, huh?

53:19.032 --> 53:23.161
Well, if he boxes how he does interviews,
this gonna be a short night.

53:24.162 --> 53:25.539
Real short night.

53:25.539 --> 53:28.625
We gonna get it on
because we don't get along.

53:29.418 --> 53:31.295
I feel sorry for Ali.

53:32.087 --> 53:33.797
Foreman could put him in the morgue.

53:48.979 --> 53:50.314
"Ali, kill him."

53:51.607 --> 53:53.192
That's what they want?

53:59.489 --> 54:00.490
Foreman...

54:23.305 --> 54:24.681
Rush him like a tiger.

54:24.681 --> 54:26.058
Shut him up for good.

54:26.058 --> 54:28.560
Ali has shocked the world before,

54:28.560 --> 54:32.564
but most of us don't expect him
to get past the middle rounds.

54:32.564 --> 54:35.984
Well, Frank,
Ali is certainly the big underdog.

54:35.984 --> 54:40.113
But he and the country have adopted
the phrase, "Ali, <i>bomaye."</i>

54:40.113 --> 54:41.323
"Ali, kill him."

54:41.323 --> 54:42.824
At 32 years of age,

54:42.824 --> 54:45.827
can Muhammad Ali dance
and stay away from Foreman?

54:45.827 --> 54:47.996
After what Foreman did to Frazier,

54:47.996 --> 54:50.958
Ali would seem to have no chance.

54:52.459 --> 54:54.545
All questions will be answered.

54:54.545 --> 54:57.089
Come on, baby. Come on, George.

54:57.089 --> 54:58.882
- You got this, George.
- Dance with him.

55:02.511 --> 55:04.930
- Get in there.
- Rush him, George. Rush him.

55:04.930 --> 55:06.515
- Right hook.
- Rush him.

55:09.852 --> 55:10.978
There you go.

55:11.645 --> 55:12.980
Punch him in the head.

55:12.980 --> 55:14.648
Let him go. Break. Break.

55:17.484 --> 55:19.027
Come on, George. Come on.

55:20.487 --> 55:21.905
Hands up. Yeah!

55:27.536 --> 55:29.663
That's all you got, George? Come on.

55:35.878 --> 55:37.004
Keep pounding.

55:37.004 --> 55:38.255
He can't last.

55:39.298 --> 55:40.424
Keep on pounding.

55:46.972 --> 55:48.390
That's right, champ.

55:51.602 --> 55:53.645
Ali retreating to the ropes,

55:53.645 --> 55:56.106
looking for a place to hide
from Foreman's power.

55:56.106 --> 55:57.065
That's all you got?

55:57.065 --> 56:00.152
I don't see any place to hide
in that ring.

56:00.903 --> 56:02.738
Ali, get off of those ropes!

56:04.031 --> 56:05.824
Foreman's pouring on the punches.

56:07.034 --> 56:09.244
Those punches gotta be doing some damage.

56:09.244 --> 56:11.663
They told me you was bad, George.
Let me see it.

56:11.663 --> 56:15.209
Ali cannot keep taking them
and expect to survive.

56:15.667 --> 56:16.835
Box.

56:22.007 --> 56:23.300
Come on. Show me something.

56:23.300 --> 56:24.760
Don't play with that sucker.

56:26.970 --> 56:28.639
Let him go. Let him go. Let him go.

56:29.973 --> 56:31.600
Stay on him, George!

56:32.601 --> 56:34.978
Come on, champ, get off the ropes.
Come on, now.

56:36.063 --> 56:37.189
There it is.

56:39.775 --> 56:40.901
Break it up, ref.

56:41.652 --> 56:44.154
- What's my name?
- There we go. Break it up.

56:49.618 --> 56:52.371
Get off those ropes! Get out of there!

56:53.288 --> 56:55.874
I'm not sure about this strategy
of retreating to the ropes.

56:55.874 --> 56:58.669
I'm going right back to the ropes.
Come and get me.

56:58.669 --> 57:00.879
Come on. Put that pressure on him, George.

57:00.879 --> 57:01.922
He's getting pounded.

57:01.922 --> 57:04.967
Those blows are deadly
from George Foreman.

57:10.389 --> 57:12.641
Come on, George. Let me see something.

57:18.146 --> 57:19.857
Get off of those ropes!

57:23.026 --> 57:25.904
Come on, George.
They told me you could hit hard.

57:26.446 --> 57:27.489
There you go.

57:37.875 --> 57:39.126
That's all you got?

57:45.674 --> 57:49.386
Big right hand from Ali.
That punch staggered Foreman.

57:49.386 --> 57:51.138
They told me you was bad, George.

57:51.138 --> 57:52.848
They told me you was bad.

57:52.848 --> 57:56.935
That one punch definitely changed
the tenor of this fight.

58:04.193 --> 58:07.529
Keep hitting him. Keep pounding him.

58:22.711 --> 58:24.004
I'm gonna end it.

58:27.758 --> 58:28.800
I'm gonna end it.

58:35.682 --> 58:37.643
Get off those ropes, champ. Come on.

58:38.560 --> 58:39.561
That's right.

59:09.132 --> 59:11.426
Foreman's punches just don't have
any juice on them.

59:11.426 --> 59:13.387
Foreman looks tired.

59:13.387 --> 59:14.680
He could be in real trouble.

59:14.680 --> 59:17.808
Maybe this is
what Ali was counting on, Frank.

59:20.394 --> 59:22.437
- Work on him, George!
- Destroy him!

59:34.241 --> 59:35.409
My turn.

59:35.409 --> 59:37.744
Come on. That's right.
Left, right, left. Come on.

59:38.745 --> 59:42.499
Oh, Muhammad Ali
with a massive right hand!

59:44.960 --> 59:46.003
And another one!

01:00:04.605 --> 01:00:08.775
...four, five, six, seven,

01:00:08.775 --> 01:00:11.820
eight, nine, ten.

01:00:11.820 --> 01:00:14.406
And it's over. It's over!

01:00:14.406 --> 01:00:16.700
Ali has done the impossible.

01:00:16.700 --> 01:00:19.620
Ali did it! Ali did it again.

01:00:28.670 --> 01:00:31.381
<i>I lived one way my whole life.</i>

01:00:33.926 --> 01:00:34.927
<i>To hurt...</i>

01:00:36.303 --> 01:00:37.596
<i>to knock down...</i>

01:00:38.889 --> 01:00:39.973
<i>to destroy.</i>

01:00:53.278 --> 01:00:55.447
<i>It became all I could see.</i>

01:00:58.617 --> 01:01:00.702
<i>I was blind to everything else.</i>

01:01:03.622 --> 01:01:05.707
<i>When will I get to see you, Daddy?</i>

01:01:07.584 --> 01:01:08.418
Soon.

01:01:10.629 --> 01:01:11.630
I promise.

01:01:13.799 --> 01:01:17.177
And we will never be apart again. Okay?

01:01:19.054 --> 01:01:21.223
<i>George, we gotta go now. It's dinnertime.</i>

01:01:22.474 --> 01:01:24.351
<i>My lawyer said
you haven't signed the papers.</i>

01:01:24.351 --> 01:01:26.103
I told you I'd get to it.

01:01:26.103 --> 01:01:27.521
<i>Get to it soon.</i>

01:01:58.552 --> 01:01:59.970
I wanted to come sooner.

01:02:00.470 --> 01:02:03.974
Why you sitting out in the car?
Why don't you come on inside?

01:02:07.561 --> 01:02:09.438
Doc said you fired Dick and Archie.

01:02:11.064 --> 01:02:11.899
Yeah.

01:02:12.774 --> 01:02:14.610
I lost a fight because of them.

01:02:17.196 --> 01:02:18.864
It's like Doc always said...

01:02:20.699 --> 01:02:22.951
I should've used my head
instead of my hands.

01:02:27.247 --> 01:02:28.665
He laid on the ropes...

01:02:29.416 --> 01:02:31.710
and I kept punching till I was tired.

01:02:34.463 --> 01:02:35.881
The rope-a-dope.

01:02:39.635 --> 01:02:40.928
And I was the dope.

01:02:42.387 --> 01:02:44.681
Look, I know you done had a hard time,

01:02:44.681 --> 01:02:47.643
but I can't stand
to hear you talking like this.

01:02:49.478 --> 01:02:52.272
<i>Foreman has been a dispirited,
lonely man</i>

01:02:52.272 --> 01:02:54.608
<i>through all of these six months
that have passed</i>

01:02:54.608 --> 01:02:57.402
<i>since Ali knocked him out
in the eighth round.</i>

01:02:57.402 --> 01:03:01.240
<i>Today, a boxing exhibition of sorts.</i>

01:03:01.240 --> 01:03:04.910
George Foreman,
former heavyweight champion of the world,

01:03:04.910 --> 01:03:08.372
will attempt to knock out
five fighters in one day.

01:03:09.456 --> 01:03:14.086
Exactly what he hopes to accomplish
by this is anybody's guess.

01:03:15.295 --> 01:03:18.006
George, you still got time to back out.

01:03:18.590 --> 01:03:19.675
You ain't gotta do this.

01:03:21.844 --> 01:03:25.264
Heavyweight champion
and world-class clown, Muhammad Ali,

01:03:25.264 --> 01:03:26.723
about to join me at the table.

01:03:26.723 --> 01:03:29.226
"Clown"? Howard, don't get hurt, now.

01:03:30.060 --> 01:03:32.396
There's the bell. And they're underway.

01:03:33.105 --> 01:03:34.940
Not his usual style, Muhammad.

01:03:34.940 --> 01:03:36.859
Yeah, I think he's trying to impress me.

01:03:36.859 --> 01:03:40.571
He's... He's bouncing around
like the Easter Bunny.

01:03:40.571 --> 01:03:42.948
Indeed, like a bunny, Muhammad.

01:03:44.408 --> 01:03:45.909
What are you doing?

01:03:45.909 --> 01:03:47.744
Get on them ropes. There you go.

01:03:47.744 --> 01:03:49.538
Stay on the ropes. Get on the ropes.

01:03:50.080 --> 01:03:51.707
Ain't no wrestling match, George.

01:03:51.707 --> 01:03:53.792
Get on the ropes now. Make him work.

01:03:56.503 --> 01:03:58.839
Now Johnson is on the canvas.

01:03:58.839 --> 01:04:01.175
- Think that might be it for Alonzo.
- Can't you see he's down?

01:04:01.175 --> 01:04:03.260
- Seems to be a scuffle.
- Back off.

01:04:03.260 --> 01:04:05.012
Oh, there's a fight breaking out

01:04:05.012 --> 01:04:08.098
- between Foreman's trainers and Johnson's.
- Step back!

01:04:08.098 --> 01:04:14.980
<i>Ali! Ali! Ali!</i>

01:04:14.980 --> 01:04:18.400
Crowd is chanting, "Ali! Ali!"

01:04:18.400 --> 01:04:21.403
much to the consternation
of George Foreman.

01:04:21.403 --> 01:04:22.779
Ali!

01:04:23.488 --> 01:04:24.656
Give me another shot.

01:04:24.656 --> 01:04:27.826
I'm not getting back in the ring
with no chump, George.

01:04:27.826 --> 01:04:29.828
That's 'cause you're scared of me.

01:04:29.828 --> 01:04:31.830
- Scared?
- You scared of me.

01:04:31.830 --> 01:04:33.957
Well, let's go right now, George.

01:04:34.666 --> 01:04:37.711
- Hold my jacket, Howard. Hold my jacket.
- Come on in the ring.

01:04:37.711 --> 01:04:41.548
- Let me go. Hold my jacket.
- Can't fight. You ain't no fighter.

01:04:41.548 --> 01:04:43.300
Man can't fight laying on no ropes.

01:04:43.300 --> 01:04:45.636
George, I'm too pretty
to fight someone as ugly as you.

01:04:45.636 --> 01:04:46.929
Come on in here.

01:04:46.929 --> 01:04:50.182
Go ahead, man. Go ahead, George.

01:04:50.182 --> 01:04:52.643
- That's what I thought. Always talk.
- I'm telling you.

01:04:52.643 --> 01:04:58.941
<i>Ali! Ali! Ali!</i>

01:05:16.750 --> 01:05:19.086
What did you think
you were gonna gain out there?

01:05:19.753 --> 01:05:20.754
Respect.

01:05:21.505 --> 01:05:24.007
Son, the beauty of boxing

01:05:24.633 --> 01:05:28.887
is that it shows a man
that can he do something all by himself.

01:05:30.389 --> 01:05:31.807
Something constructive.

01:05:36.228 --> 01:05:41.233
Let's go back to fighting them
one at a time. What you say?

01:05:47.364 --> 01:05:48.532
This just came through.

01:05:51.118 --> 01:05:51.952
Okay.

01:05:53.036 --> 01:05:54.037
It's for you.

01:06:06.717 --> 01:06:08.135
George. George.

01:06:09.845 --> 01:06:11.847
- What happened?
- Mary started bleeding.

01:06:11.847 --> 01:06:15.267
They're trying to save the baby,
but the air got cut off.

01:06:15.267 --> 01:06:17.811
Tell them, whatever it cost,
I'll pay for it.

01:06:17.811 --> 01:06:19.104
We need the best doctors.

01:06:19.104 --> 01:06:21.565
We already got the best doctors, George.

01:06:21.565 --> 01:06:24.484
The baby needs a miracle. We need to pray.

01:06:26.862 --> 01:06:27.696
Pray?

01:06:35.662 --> 01:06:38.665
Heavenly Father,
we are gathered here humbly,

01:06:38.665 --> 01:06:41.043
in the name of your son, Christ Jesus.

01:07:11.448 --> 01:07:13.825
All right, here I am.

01:07:18.622 --> 01:07:20.707
What did my sister ever do to you?

01:07:21.250 --> 01:07:25.754
Mary's been sweet and kind
her whole life...

01:07:27.297 --> 01:07:28.966
to everybody in this world.

01:07:30.384 --> 01:07:31.218
To me,

01:07:32.052 --> 01:07:33.554
when I didn't deserve it.

01:07:35.222 --> 01:07:37.474
And you gonna take her baby?

01:07:38.559 --> 01:07:39.560
Answer me.

01:07:40.894 --> 01:07:43.063
Man, all my life
I've been hearing about you.

01:07:44.231 --> 01:07:46.441
And you ain't never shown me nothing.

01:07:48.443 --> 01:07:49.945
I ain't seen anything.

01:07:57.369 --> 01:07:59.204
If you wanna take somebody...

01:08:00.956 --> 01:08:01.957
you take me.

01:08:05.085 --> 01:08:07.296
You don't take my sister's baby, man.

01:08:10.591 --> 01:08:11.592
You take me.

01:08:13.635 --> 01:08:14.553
Please.

01:08:19.850 --> 01:08:20.850
George.

01:08:38.076 --> 01:08:40.746
- Is he...?
- He's perfect.

01:08:42.622 --> 01:08:44.666
The doctors can't explain it.

01:08:45.250 --> 01:08:46.542
It's a miracle.

01:08:48.170 --> 01:08:49.171
That's...

01:08:51.298 --> 01:08:53.466
It's good. That's good.

01:08:56.970 --> 01:08:58.346
Well, come on over.

01:08:59.932 --> 01:09:01.808
Say hi to your nephew.

01:09:04.019 --> 01:09:05.229
Little George.

01:09:06.647 --> 01:09:07.773
Little George?

01:09:08.482 --> 01:09:09.316
Yeah.

01:09:13.487 --> 01:09:14.947
Mama told me you prayed.

01:09:18.242 --> 01:09:20.202
Whatever you said to him...

01:09:22.078 --> 01:09:23.205
it worked.

01:09:41.598 --> 01:09:43.517
<i>Jimmy Young! Jimmy Young!</i>

01:09:43.517 --> 01:09:48.188
Listen to the crowd.
"Jimmy Young. Jimmy Young."

01:09:48.188 --> 01:09:51.649
Foreman hasn't been the same
since he lost to Ali.

01:09:51.649 --> 01:09:54.278
- He fired his old team...
- Come on, George.

01:09:54.278 --> 01:09:55.571
...but it hasn't worked.

01:09:57.656 --> 01:10:00.534
George's mind is just not in this fight.

01:10:18.969 --> 01:10:20.179
Let's go. All right.

01:10:26.560 --> 01:10:30.856
Jimmy Young has won the fight
by unanimous decision.

01:10:30.856 --> 01:10:32.566
Promising future for Jimmy...

01:10:46.538 --> 01:10:47.956
Keep an eye on him, all right?

01:10:51.335 --> 01:10:52.961
What happened out there, George?

01:10:53.545 --> 01:10:54.922
Come on, Gil. It's just a fight.

01:10:54.922 --> 01:10:56.256
Every boxer has a bad one.

01:10:56.256 --> 01:10:58.509
He couldn't afford one.
It was our shot back to Ali.

01:10:58.509 --> 01:10:59.843
Man, it's hot.

01:11:00.969 --> 01:11:02.429
Why's it so hot in here?

01:11:08.894 --> 01:11:09.895
Who said that?

01:11:10.771 --> 01:11:12.564
Nobody said nothing, George.

01:11:16.235 --> 01:11:17.319
Who said that?

01:11:21.156 --> 01:11:23.075
- Who keeps talking?
- Nobody.

01:11:23.075 --> 01:11:24.910
Nobody's talking, George.

01:11:24.910 --> 01:11:26.286
George?

01:11:31.834 --> 01:11:32.960
I'm...

01:11:35.754 --> 01:11:37.005
I'm fixing...

01:11:37.005 --> 01:11:38.507
Whoa, George. George!

01:11:40.050 --> 01:11:42.511
He's got a faint pulse.
We need to get him up on the table.

01:11:42.511 --> 01:11:43.428
On three.

01:11:43.428 --> 01:11:45.848
- One, two, three.
- Careful.

01:11:47.099 --> 01:11:50.519
- Easy.
- There you go. On the table. Here we go.

01:11:52.229 --> 01:11:53.063
All right.

01:11:53.647 --> 01:11:54.898
- George?
- George?

01:11:55.482 --> 01:11:56.483
George.

01:12:06.910 --> 01:12:08.161
<i>I don't wanna die.</i>

01:12:10.080 --> 01:12:11.206
<i>I believe.</i>

01:12:14.042 --> 01:12:15.252
<i>I believe.</i>

01:12:19.965 --> 01:12:21.341
- Hey.
- Whoa, easy.

01:12:23.218 --> 01:12:24.386
George?

01:12:27.639 --> 01:12:29.183
We thought you was dead.

01:12:31.393 --> 01:12:32.394
I was.

01:12:38.108 --> 01:12:40.152
Jesus Christ is alive in me.

01:12:42.487 --> 01:12:43.697
He's alive in me.

01:12:44.323 --> 01:12:45.324
He's alive.

01:12:45.991 --> 01:12:47.075
I gotta get myself clean.

01:12:47.075 --> 01:12:49.328
Don't let him get in the shower.
Cold water will be a shock.

01:12:49.328 --> 01:12:51.622
- Wait!
- I gotta get myself clean.

01:12:51.622 --> 01:12:52.873
- Wait. No, George.
- Get off.

01:12:52.873 --> 01:12:55.542
I gotta get myself clean! Please, please.

01:12:55.542 --> 01:12:57.169
Hallelujah!

01:12:59.129 --> 01:13:00.422
Hallelujah!

01:13:02.674 --> 01:13:03.717
I'm clean.

01:13:05.511 --> 01:13:06.512
I'm clean.

01:13:09.556 --> 01:13:12.392
I'm clean. I'm clean.

01:13:12.392 --> 01:13:14.394
<i>I now baptize you</i>

01:13:14.394 --> 01:13:17.231
in the name of the Father,

01:13:17.231 --> 01:13:19.233
the son and the holy spirit.

01:13:20.067 --> 01:13:21.193
Hallelujah!

01:13:22.611 --> 01:13:24.071
- Hallelujah!
- Hallelujah!

01:13:34.623 --> 01:13:35.916
Hallelujah!

01:13:39.169 --> 01:13:42.798
<i>We are bearing witness to a miracle.</i>

01:13:42.798 --> 01:13:44.132
And Brother George...

01:13:44.842 --> 01:13:48.554
would like to share his version
of that miracle with you.

01:13:48.554 --> 01:13:50.472
So let's give a proper welcome

01:13:50.472 --> 01:13:53.392
to the former heavyweight champion
of the world

01:13:53.392 --> 01:13:56.603
and our new brother in Christ,
George Foreman!

01:14:12.202 --> 01:14:13.620
Thank you, Reverend Stokes.

01:14:16.874 --> 01:14:17.708
I...

01:14:18.876 --> 01:14:19.960
was in a fight.

01:14:23.755 --> 01:14:25.424
I used to love fighting.

01:14:38.645 --> 01:14:40.272
I was in the dressing room, and...

01:14:42.608 --> 01:14:44.693
And Jesus Christ came alive in me.

01:14:48.113 --> 01:14:48.947
And...

01:14:50.115 --> 01:14:51.325
And because of it...

01:14:52.534 --> 01:14:54.411
I wanna give my life to God.

01:14:58.498 --> 01:14:59.333
All right.

01:15:00.167 --> 01:15:01.502
I wanna be a preacher.

01:15:07.633 --> 01:15:08.634
Thank you, Jesus.

01:15:09.468 --> 01:15:11.303
- Praise God!
- All right.

01:15:12.179 --> 01:15:15.599
He may have finally found somebody
who can tell him what to do.

01:15:15.599 --> 01:15:17.267
Praise Jesus!

01:15:17.267 --> 01:15:19.520
- Hallelujah! Hallelujah.
- Hallelujah.

01:15:19.520 --> 01:15:20.979
- Yeah.
- Praise Jesus.

01:15:20.979 --> 01:15:22.189
Praise Jesus.

01:15:29.613 --> 01:15:31.615
You put on quite a show in there.

01:15:32.574 --> 01:15:34.368
I'm glad you was here to see it.

01:15:35.202 --> 01:15:38.789
So Gil's been setting the traps.
We still got us a path to Ali.

01:15:39.748 --> 01:15:40.749
I'm done.

01:15:41.792 --> 01:15:43.335
I'm not gonna box anymore.

01:15:45.629 --> 01:15:47.923
- You a fighter.
- I'm not a fighter.

01:15:49.716 --> 01:15:50.801
Not anymore.

01:15:53.387 --> 01:15:55.222
So how are you gonna take care
of your kids?

01:15:56.223 --> 01:15:57.891
I'm gonna follow God.

01:15:59.059 --> 01:16:02.020
Do you know
what you're walking away from, son?

01:16:02.604 --> 01:16:03.856
You know, I...

01:16:03.856 --> 01:16:06.191
I can't even make a fist anymore, Doc.

01:16:06.900 --> 01:16:09.736
It's like he reached inside of me...

01:16:10.821 --> 01:16:12.948
just took out all my anger.

01:16:14.157 --> 01:16:15.701
That anger inside of you...

01:16:16.493 --> 01:16:17.786
it made you king.

01:16:18.745 --> 01:16:19.746
I saw it.

01:16:20.455 --> 01:16:22.875
Now you wanna tell me that it's all gone?

01:16:22.875 --> 01:16:27.337
Remember when you told me that
you traded in one uniform for another?

01:16:30.257 --> 01:16:31.592
That's what I'm doing.

01:16:33.594 --> 01:16:36.513
You can understand that, can't you?

01:16:36.513 --> 01:16:38.765
I had no say, George.

01:16:40.017 --> 01:16:41.727
My choice was made for me.

01:16:44.021 --> 01:16:45.272
So was mine.

01:16:49.776 --> 01:16:51.445
I don't believe you, George.

01:17:02.456 --> 01:17:06.460
<i>For 28 years,
I used my fists to get respect.</i>

01:17:08.295 --> 01:17:10.589
<i>I knew I had to start using my heart.</i>

01:17:13.383 --> 01:17:14.760
<i>I just didn't know how.</i>

01:17:16.553 --> 01:17:19.264
<i>She told me
Big George Foreman was at the door.</i>

01:17:20.015 --> 01:17:22.726
And I said, "Beatrice, you are crazy.

01:17:22.726 --> 01:17:24.895
George Foreman ain't coming
to see the champ

01:17:24.895 --> 01:17:27.314
unless he's looking for another whupping."

01:17:39.910 --> 01:17:42.079
So I've come here...

01:17:43.705 --> 01:17:46.792
to tell you that I found Jesus.

01:17:46.792 --> 01:17:47.918
You found Jesus?

01:17:48.710 --> 01:17:51.713
Congratulations, George.
I did not know he was lost.

01:17:54.800 --> 01:17:55.801
I came here...

01:17:57.761 --> 01:17:59.596
to ask for your forgiveness.

01:17:59.596 --> 01:18:01.723
- For my forgiveness?
- Yes.

01:18:01.723 --> 01:18:03.725
I'm the one who knocked you out.

01:18:03.725 --> 01:18:04.893
You know...

01:18:06.687 --> 01:18:07.980
after Zaire...

01:18:09.690 --> 01:18:12.234
I hated you, Muhammad.

01:18:13.527 --> 01:18:14.528
I did.

01:18:15.654 --> 01:18:17.281
And I wanted to kill you...

01:18:18.156 --> 01:18:19.533
with these hands.

01:18:19.533 --> 01:18:23.078
Come on, man.
You want a rematch. I know.

01:18:23.078 --> 01:18:24.329
Just come out and say it.

01:18:25.038 --> 01:18:26.498
I don't want no rematch.

01:18:26.999 --> 01:18:29.751
They told me you retired to preach,
but I didn't believe it.

01:18:29.751 --> 01:18:30.669
Well, I...

01:18:31.503 --> 01:18:32.921
I wanna help people.

01:18:32.921 --> 01:18:34.673
Well, George, help me, okay?

01:18:34.673 --> 01:18:37.759
All you got to do is fight Kenny Norton
one more time. Knock him out.

01:18:37.759 --> 01:18:40.596
Please, George, knock him out.
Because I sure can't.

01:18:40.596 --> 01:18:43.056
You knock him out,
he won't be a top-ranked contender.

01:18:43.056 --> 01:18:44.683
I'll give you another shot at the title.

01:18:44.683 --> 01:18:47.561
And then we'll both get paid, huh?
Praise Jesus.

01:18:52.691 --> 01:18:55.777
I can't help you that way.

01:19:01.742 --> 01:19:02.868
All right, brother.

01:19:04.161 --> 01:19:04.995
Fine.

01:19:07.247 --> 01:19:08.248
I forgive you.

01:19:11.210 --> 01:19:13.003
George Foreman, a preacher.

01:19:13.003 --> 01:19:15.047
Now I have seen it all.

01:19:23.972 --> 01:19:25.057
Hi!

01:19:27.267 --> 01:19:29.686
- What are you doing here?
- Hey, Michi.

01:19:30.270 --> 01:19:33.190
- I love you.
- Michi, take your brother inside.

01:19:33.899 --> 01:19:35.192
Go inside, George.

01:19:39.530 --> 01:19:40.948
What are you doing here?

01:19:46.995 --> 01:19:48.080
I came here...

01:19:49.581 --> 01:19:53.669
to tell you how sorry I am
for the way that I treated you.

01:19:56.797 --> 01:19:58.048
It wasn't right.

01:20:02.594 --> 01:20:06.598
"Let love be without dissimulation.

01:20:06.598 --> 01:20:08.892
Cleave to that which is good."

01:20:23.156 --> 01:20:23.991
Hi.

01:20:27.494 --> 01:20:28.495
I'm George.

01:20:30.080 --> 01:20:31.832
Mary Joan Martelly.

01:20:31.832 --> 01:20:35.627
You were sitting in that same seat
the day I gave my testimony.

01:20:41.008 --> 01:20:42.593
You always sat up front?

01:20:43.427 --> 01:20:46.388
Yes. Helps me stay focused on God.

01:20:53.812 --> 01:20:55.647
How's being a preacher going for you?

01:20:56.690 --> 01:20:57.691
It's hard.

01:20:58.734 --> 01:20:59.568
Real hard.

01:21:00.068 --> 01:21:02.821
Harder than getting punched in the face?

01:21:06.533 --> 01:21:09.411
Sometimes it feels about the same.

01:21:10.996 --> 01:21:13.540
Blessed is the man who remains steadfast.

01:21:21.298 --> 01:21:24.343
Brothers and sisters, I am out here today,

01:21:24.968 --> 01:21:26.762
not to lift myself up,

01:21:26.762 --> 01:21:29.348
but to lift up the name of Jesus Christ.

01:21:29.973 --> 01:21:33.352
See, I was a man
who rejected all religion.

01:21:33.352 --> 01:21:35.145
"Jesus" was a cussword to me,

01:21:35.145 --> 01:21:37.606
but the Lord changed my life.

01:21:37.606 --> 01:21:39.399
Wasn't the Lord who changed you.

01:21:39.399 --> 01:21:42.778
It was Jimmy Young.
I seen him beat the hell out of you.

01:21:42.778 --> 01:21:44.488
Did you at least pinch him?

01:21:46.615 --> 01:21:49.618
Don't you miss being in that ring,
big fella?

01:21:53.205 --> 01:21:54.373
I'll die...

01:21:54.915 --> 01:21:57.125
before I get back in that ring again.

01:21:58.460 --> 01:21:59.294
Now...

01:22:04.424 --> 01:22:07.970
Now, you could take
all of the Rockefellers' money

01:22:07.970 --> 01:22:09.972
and all of the Kennedys' money,

01:22:09.972 --> 01:22:11.598
and you put that together,

01:22:11.598 --> 01:22:14.893
it wouldn't come to a down payment
on my getting back in that ring again.

01:22:18.021 --> 01:22:20.315
Praise God. Thank you, Jesus.

01:22:20.315 --> 01:22:22.317
Jesus is alive today.

01:22:24.444 --> 01:22:25.279
I...

01:22:26.029 --> 01:22:28.532
I felt bad for how I acted last Sunday.

01:22:28.532 --> 01:22:31.326
- Well, how did you act?
- Kind of cold.

01:22:32.870 --> 01:22:35.664
- Yes.
- Well, you had a reputation.

01:22:35.664 --> 01:22:37.541
And not a godly one.

01:22:39.293 --> 01:22:40.711
Well, I'm different now.

01:22:41.587 --> 01:22:44.006
You know, I hadn't yet learnt the secret

01:22:44.006 --> 01:22:47.134
to enjoying every day for itself.

01:22:47.134 --> 01:22:50.721
How to make the most of each day
as it comes.

01:22:50.721 --> 01:22:52.097
Do you have children?

01:22:55.100 --> 01:22:55.934
Yes.

01:22:56.977 --> 01:22:59.688
They don't live with me full-time,
you know, which is hard,

01:22:59.688 --> 01:23:03.108
but I'm gonna be seeing
a whole lot more of them now.

01:23:04.067 --> 01:23:04.902
Yes, indeed.

01:23:06.028 --> 01:23:07.362
I'm glad to hear that.

01:23:14.745 --> 01:23:16.496
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

01:23:45.943 --> 01:23:46.777
You okay?

01:23:47.444 --> 01:23:49.988
- Yeah. Yeah.
- I thought we were going to a movie.

01:23:52.533 --> 01:23:53.951
I wanna show you something.

01:23:55.410 --> 01:23:57.162
What's that look like to you?

01:23:58.580 --> 01:24:00.541
A church that's run out of faith.

01:24:02.251 --> 01:24:03.252
No.

01:24:04.086 --> 01:24:05.712
You know, I'm gonna buy it.

01:24:07.256 --> 01:24:08.966
And I'm gonna preach in it.

01:24:10.300 --> 01:24:12.052
And be the best I can be.

01:24:13.428 --> 01:24:15.347
And I'm gonna spread his word.

01:24:20.394 --> 01:24:22.104
Do you believe I can do that?

01:24:22.771 --> 01:24:23.772
Yes.

01:24:24.439 --> 01:24:25.440
I do.

01:24:32.197 --> 01:24:36.702
<i>You got to fight for your faith.
Every one of you, every day.</i>

01:24:36.702 --> 01:24:41.164
One Sunday morning,
when the sun is shining real bright...

01:24:44.251 --> 01:24:47.880
and your husband, he's standing there
with his swim trunks on,

01:24:48.964 --> 01:24:50.174
holding a blanket,

01:24:50.966 --> 01:24:52.885
saying, "The beach is waiting, baby!"

01:24:53.677 --> 01:24:55.262
And you think to yourself, you say:

01:24:57.014 --> 01:25:00.350
"Is missing one little service
really gonna hurt me?"

01:25:03.312 --> 01:25:07.232
Now, if you don't shine your shoes,
do they get shined?

01:25:07.232 --> 01:25:08.150
No.

01:25:08.150 --> 01:25:11.028
- Don't wash your clothes, they get washed?
- No.

01:25:11.028 --> 01:25:14.198
If you don't fight for your faith,
it'll fall away.

01:25:15.699 --> 01:25:17.910
You gotta do it.
Gotta fight for your faith.

01:25:17.910 --> 01:25:19.536
If you gonna fight for anything,
fight for that.

01:25:19.536 --> 01:25:20.454
Amen.

01:25:22.372 --> 01:25:24.291
Thank you. All right. Take care.

01:25:25.167 --> 01:25:26.502
All right. All right.

01:25:26.502 --> 01:25:27.836
Pastor Foreman.

01:25:28.629 --> 01:25:29.963
I need your help.

01:25:31.006 --> 01:25:33.091
Would you train my grandson, Jalen?

01:25:33.759 --> 01:25:36.053
If he had a good male role model
to teach him,

01:25:36.053 --> 01:25:38.096
instead of the boys that he's...

01:25:38.096 --> 01:25:42.601
Well, I'd sign up to train with Ali
but not the guy who lost to him.

01:25:42.601 --> 01:25:45.979
- Jalen...
- It's all right. It's all right.

01:25:45.979 --> 01:25:48.065
He remind me of myself when I was his age.

01:25:48.065 --> 01:25:49.525
Can you teach him to box?

01:25:49.525 --> 01:25:51.443
Well, boxing's not the answer.

01:25:51.443 --> 01:25:53.278
You see, the answers are in here.

01:25:53.278 --> 01:25:54.947
Young man, you read the Bible,

01:25:54.947 --> 01:25:57.032
keep coming to church,
everything will work out.

01:25:57.032 --> 01:25:59.743
All right.
All right, sister. God bless you.

01:25:59.743 --> 01:26:01.578
- Have a good day. All right.
- Okay.

01:26:02.538 --> 01:26:03.997
Something smells good in here.

01:26:09.628 --> 01:26:11.255
- I love you.
- I love you.

01:26:12.422 --> 01:26:13.423
Hey!

01:26:15.133 --> 01:26:16.385
You're getting heavy.

01:26:16.385 --> 01:26:17.469
Come here, boy.

01:26:17.469 --> 01:26:19.012
- You know I love you, right?
- Yeah.

01:26:19.012 --> 01:26:21.139
- All right, let me get a kiss.
- No. No way.

01:26:21.139 --> 01:26:23.517
Give me a kiss. Come here.
Don't wanna kiss your daddy?

01:26:23.517 --> 01:26:26.687
<i>...to the epidemic of street violence
that's been plaguing the Fifth Ward.</i>

01:26:26.687 --> 01:26:29.231
<i>Two suspects have been apprehended
in this robbery.</i>

01:26:29.231 --> 01:26:31.984
<i>- An attempted robbery...</i>
- Take your brother to the other room.

01:26:31.984 --> 01:26:33.986
<i>...with one man in critical condition.</i>

01:26:33.986 --> 01:26:36.613
<i>The juveniles are being held without bail.</i>

01:26:39.575 --> 01:26:40.576
You okay?

01:26:45.998 --> 01:26:47.791
His grandmother brought him to me...

01:26:49.001 --> 01:26:50.002
last week.

01:26:50.627 --> 01:26:51.920
That same kid.

01:26:53.630 --> 01:26:57.801
But I was so, you know,
full of myself being full of God that...

01:27:00.804 --> 01:27:01.889
I missed it.

01:27:02.806 --> 01:27:04.349
What did you miss, George?

01:27:07.102 --> 01:27:09.188
I should have met that kid where he was.

01:27:11.732 --> 01:27:13.483
Not where I wanted him to be.

01:27:20.741 --> 01:27:23.952
George, are you sure you wanna do this?

01:27:25.537 --> 01:27:26.538
Yeah.

01:27:27.331 --> 01:27:31.877
Okay. I'll talk to the bank about moving
a few of your assets around.

01:27:33.128 --> 01:27:34.838
Come on.
I wanna show y'all something here.

01:27:36.089 --> 01:27:37.716
Now, I have an idea.

01:27:48.477 --> 01:27:49.728
All right, I got you.

01:27:52.648 --> 01:27:53.857
That's heavy.

01:27:53.857 --> 01:27:55.984
Help me with this bed over here!

01:27:59.863 --> 01:28:01.156
Hurry up, now.

01:28:04.284 --> 01:28:05.869
That's looking good.

01:28:11.959 --> 01:28:14.211
- Tighten up these ropes.
- Hook that up.

01:28:14.211 --> 01:28:15.921
- Make sure they're not loose.
- Got it.

01:28:36.400 --> 01:28:39.486
I would've blocked it,
but somebody raised the rim.

01:28:39.486 --> 01:28:41.071
Hey, fellas. Come on in.

01:28:42.114 --> 01:28:43.740
Come on in. Enjoy yourself.

01:29:00.632 --> 01:29:02.551
Hey, Nate. Ain't seen you in a while.

01:29:02.551 --> 01:29:05.345
Hey, nice haircut, man.
Look, it's almost as good as mine.

01:29:07.181 --> 01:29:08.557
What's going on, y'all?

01:29:08.557 --> 01:29:10.267
Hey, sister. How you doing?

01:29:10.267 --> 01:29:11.435
Good, good.

01:29:11.435 --> 01:29:14.688
Hey, man. You're always fouling somebody.
I see you.

01:29:15.898 --> 01:29:17.065
Looking good.

01:29:22.321 --> 01:29:23.405
I got this, y'all.

01:29:24.072 --> 01:29:25.115
Don't worry about it.

01:29:25.115 --> 01:29:28.202
This has never happened here
at the youth center before.

01:29:28.202 --> 01:29:30.704
- This just doesn't make any sense.
- Roberta, what's going on?

01:29:31.663 --> 01:29:35.292
Are you absolutely sure?
Because it just doesn't sound right.

01:29:38.128 --> 01:29:42.090
Okay. No, I understand.
We'll take care of it immediately.

01:29:46.303 --> 01:29:48.805
Power company said we never paid the bill.

01:29:49.556 --> 01:29:50.390
Really?

01:29:50.974 --> 01:29:54.061
Well, just get Des on it.

01:29:54.645 --> 01:29:56.188
He didn't come in today.

01:29:57.564 --> 01:29:58.941
<i>I'm sorry, Mr. Foreman,</i>

01:29:58.941 --> 01:30:00.901
but I don't understand
how you didn't know.

01:30:00.901 --> 01:30:02.027
How much is left?

01:30:02.027 --> 01:30:03.904
A little over $2000.

01:30:03.904 --> 01:30:05.197
That can't be right.

01:30:06.365 --> 01:30:08.575
Just use some of the money
from my investments accounts

01:30:08.575 --> 01:30:09.826
to keep the youth center open.

01:30:09.826 --> 01:30:12.037
Those investments went belly-up
over the last year.

01:30:12.037 --> 01:30:13.622
Des told me we were good.

01:30:13.622 --> 01:30:15.582
I'm sorry, but that's just not true.

01:30:15.582 --> 01:30:18.085
He put them into solid stocks
to set me up for life.

01:30:18.085 --> 01:30:20.879
No. These were all high-risk gambles.

01:30:20.879 --> 01:30:22.172
No, that's--

01:30:22.172 --> 01:30:25.759
Look, I'm sorry, Mr. Foreman,
but if these payments aren't made soon,

01:30:25.759 --> 01:30:28.512
the bank will have
to start repossessing the property.

01:30:58.667 --> 01:31:01.461
Roy says you got the whole town
looking for Desmond.

01:31:02.379 --> 01:31:03.380
That's right.

01:31:05.340 --> 01:31:06.842
You need to leave him be.

01:31:09.011 --> 01:31:10.721
I gave it all to him.

01:31:13.348 --> 01:31:14.641
And he lost it.

01:31:17.352 --> 01:31:18.896
Not just the youth center.

01:31:23.567 --> 01:31:26.195
Everything I worked for...

01:31:29.781 --> 01:31:30.824
it's gone.

01:31:30.824 --> 01:31:31.909
No, no, no.

01:31:33.118 --> 01:31:36.330
Everything you worked for is in here.

01:31:40.959 --> 01:31:43.170
Ever since you was a little boy...

01:31:46.423 --> 01:31:49.009
I tried to put you on the right path.

01:31:51.678 --> 01:31:52.846
But you found it.

01:31:53.847 --> 01:31:55.265
All by yourself.

01:31:56.308 --> 01:31:57.559
You found God.

01:31:59.144 --> 01:32:00.312
Be godly.

01:32:03.815 --> 01:32:06.944
Don't let Desmond Baker take that
from you too.

01:32:36.139 --> 01:32:36.974
Tell me.

01:32:37.766 --> 01:32:41.895
Tell me you put the money somewhere else.
In some other account I don't know about!

01:32:42.646 --> 01:32:44.815
- Tell me it's not all gone.
- It's gone.

01:32:44.815 --> 01:32:47.526
- I lost it.
- Tell me it's not all gone.

01:32:47.526 --> 01:32:48.819
I lost it.

01:32:59.413 --> 01:33:01.164
I'm sorry, George.

01:33:10.674 --> 01:33:12.843
Any time you're ready, Mr. Foreman.

01:33:13.427 --> 01:33:16.054
This summer,
when you're out grilling with the family,

01:33:16.054 --> 01:33:18.891
there's only one sauce
that has the sweetness and the spiceness

01:33:18.891 --> 01:33:20.559
that everyone loves.

01:33:20.559 --> 01:33:22.227
- Miss--
- You said "spiceness," George.

01:33:23.061 --> 01:33:24.062
I did?

01:33:24.062 --> 01:33:26.607
Yeah. "Spiceness" isn't a word.

01:33:31.653 --> 01:33:34.031
Hi. How are you? Thank you.

01:33:34.031 --> 01:33:36.533
Can you sign this, champ? Thank you.

01:33:37.576 --> 01:33:38.577
- Hello.
- Hi.

01:33:38.577 --> 01:33:39.661
Thank you so much.

01:33:43.916 --> 01:33:45.125
Thank you so much.

01:33:47.169 --> 01:33:48.378
Thank you.

01:33:51.215 --> 01:33:53.050
When you're out grilling with the family,

01:33:53.050 --> 01:33:57.054
there's only one sauce
that has the sweetness and the spice

01:33:57.054 --> 01:33:58.680
that everyone loves.

01:34:00.015 --> 01:34:03.352
Miss Tammie's Mesquite
and Original Barbecue Sauce.

01:34:03.352 --> 01:34:04.686
Get them while they're hot.

01:34:06.355 --> 01:34:09.441
Adding in the money
from Miss Tammie's commercial...

01:34:10.817 --> 01:34:12.027
Chump change.

01:34:13.529 --> 01:34:16.448
That's what they pay you
for looking like a chump on TV.

01:34:16.448 --> 01:34:18.492
Every little bit counts, George.

01:34:18.492 --> 01:34:20.202
I done sold everything I have.

01:34:21.995 --> 01:34:23.539
I done cut every corner.

01:34:27.167 --> 01:34:28.168
How are we?

01:34:32.923 --> 01:34:34.174
Short.

01:34:34.758 --> 01:34:35.884
Well, how short?

01:34:37.010 --> 01:34:38.387
Not even close.

01:36:10.020 --> 01:36:11.813
I know you hate this thing.

01:36:11.813 --> 01:36:13.649
It's just a bag. I don't hate it.

01:36:14.274 --> 01:36:15.776
It is filthy though.

01:36:18.487 --> 01:36:20.697
- Come to bed.
- I'm not tired.

01:36:20.697 --> 01:36:22.658
But you have a sermon to give tomorrow.

01:36:22.658 --> 01:36:24.284
Pastor Carl's filling in for me.

01:36:24.284 --> 01:36:25.619
Why?

01:36:27.204 --> 01:36:29.206
So I ain't gotta stand up there,

01:36:29.206 --> 01:36:31.291
tell all those people
how they should live.

01:36:31.291 --> 01:36:33.377
That's what a pastor does, right?

01:36:33.377 --> 01:36:35.754
It's my fault the money's gone, Joan.

01:36:36.463 --> 01:36:37.840
Don't say that, George.

01:36:37.840 --> 01:36:39.591
Well, I knew what Des was.

01:36:41.176 --> 01:36:42.886
And I trusted him anyway?

01:36:53.730 --> 01:36:55.148
I need to fight again.

01:36:59.194 --> 01:37:00.988
You swore you wouldn't.

01:37:04.116 --> 01:37:07.077
That moment when you first
came up to me in church,

01:37:07.870 --> 01:37:11.456
I saw a man who wanted to change his life.

01:37:11.456 --> 01:37:13.500
I fell in love with that man.

01:37:14.543 --> 01:37:17.838
The old you, I don't know.

01:37:17.838 --> 01:37:19.298
And I don't want to.

01:37:20.340 --> 01:37:21.175
Joan.

01:37:22.509 --> 01:37:24.928
There's only two things I know how to do.

01:37:26.597 --> 01:37:28.849
That's box and preach.

01:37:31.685 --> 01:37:32.853
But preaching...

01:37:36.773 --> 01:37:38.567
Preaching won't pay the bills.

01:37:39.318 --> 01:37:41.403
What if all your rage comes back?

01:37:45.324 --> 01:37:47.284
What if you can't win without it?

01:37:51.705 --> 01:37:54.082
Step forward. Step back.

01:37:54.082 --> 01:37:56.460
Step to the left. To the right.

01:37:57.169 --> 01:37:59.296
Step forward. Step back.

01:37:59.296 --> 01:38:02.049
Step left. Step right.

01:38:02.049 --> 01:38:04.468
Step forward. Step back.

01:38:04.468 --> 01:38:06.762
Step left. Step right. Great.

01:38:06.762 --> 01:38:09.306
Now. Now, cut me off! Cut me off.

01:38:12.267 --> 01:38:13.644
<i>When you quit boxing...</i>

01:38:16.438 --> 01:38:18.440
you dang near broke my heart.

01:38:21.151 --> 01:38:22.694
It felt like you quit me.

01:38:25.781 --> 01:38:27.074
But I came back here.

01:38:27.699 --> 01:38:29.201
I dug back in.

01:38:30.077 --> 01:38:30.911
And...

01:38:31.787 --> 01:38:33.622
you know, funny thing happened.

01:38:33.622 --> 01:38:35.666
I remembered who I was.

01:38:38.710 --> 01:38:40.295
I'm happy here, George.

01:38:41.588 --> 01:38:43.590
You made me something once, Doc.

01:38:45.217 --> 01:38:46.844
You can do it again.

01:38:46.844 --> 01:38:49.137
Joe Louis tried to come back.

01:38:49.847 --> 01:38:52.015
Marciano almost killed him in the ring.

01:38:52.015 --> 01:38:56.019
Joe Louis tried to start at the top.
But we'll start at the bottom.

01:38:56.019 --> 01:38:58.772
You're old. They'll call us a circus act.

01:38:58.772 --> 01:39:00.816
But not if we keep winning.

01:39:01.441 --> 01:39:02.442
Doc.

01:39:03.735 --> 01:39:05.821
You know, we can do something here.

01:39:06.947 --> 01:39:09.950
Something that's beyond their imagination.

01:39:11.410 --> 01:39:16.582
The morning that we wake up to fight
for that heavyweight championship belt...

01:39:17.624 --> 01:39:19.960
oh, man,

01:39:19.960 --> 01:39:21.962
the air's gonna taste different.

01:39:23.130 --> 01:39:26.258
The sun, that's gonna look different.

01:39:28.010 --> 01:39:30.929
Only two men
on this whole earth is gonna matter.

01:39:31.430 --> 01:39:33.265
And we'll be the both of them.

01:39:41.815 --> 01:39:42.941
How much you weigh?

01:39:44.234 --> 01:39:45.611
How much I wait?

01:39:45.611 --> 01:39:47.946
I said, how much do you weigh?

01:39:47.946 --> 01:39:49.323
Oh, how much I weigh.

01:39:50.490 --> 01:39:52.576
- Like on a scale.
- Yeah.

01:39:55.913 --> 01:39:58.665
About 299.

01:39:58.665 --> 01:40:02.002
Really more toward the 85 range,
but about 29--

01:40:02.002 --> 01:40:03.462
I would say 299.

01:40:03.462 --> 01:40:05.797
Last I checked, lying was a sin.

01:40:09.927 --> 01:40:12.679
I'm about 315,

01:40:12.679 --> 01:40:15.057
318 after breakfast.

01:40:15.891 --> 01:40:18.185
You get down to 265...

01:40:19.645 --> 01:40:20.687
then call me.

01:40:39.373 --> 01:40:41.166
I think my gym clothes shrunk.

01:40:55.556 --> 01:40:57.432
Hey, George, take it easy, man.

01:40:58.517 --> 01:41:00.060
You're gonna have a heart attack.

01:41:04.022 --> 01:41:05.566
That's nasty, George.

01:41:35.387 --> 01:41:37.347
All right, who's ready for pancakes?

01:41:37.347 --> 01:41:40.017
I'm ready for pancakes. Yes, indeed.

01:41:41.268 --> 01:41:42.311
There you go, baby.

01:41:42.311 --> 01:41:45.147
Yep. I'm gonna get me, like, five of them.

01:42:51.255 --> 01:42:53.966
Okay. Get on up there.

01:42:54.591 --> 01:42:55.968
That's where the fighting is.

01:42:59.012 --> 01:43:00.013
Time!

01:43:15.320 --> 01:43:16.655
Come on, cut him off!

01:43:18.365 --> 01:43:19.658
Cut him off!

01:43:20.492 --> 01:43:21.785
Cut him off!

01:43:28.125 --> 01:43:29.293
Move your feet.

01:43:32.963 --> 01:43:34.673
Come on. Come on, George.

01:43:37.509 --> 01:43:38.635
Time!

01:43:45.225 --> 01:43:48.187
We're gonna need
to get you some new tricks.

01:43:48.187 --> 01:43:51.732
Some new arms
and some new legs might help too.

01:43:52.941 --> 01:43:55.652
This ain't funny, George.
This ain't funny.

01:44:24.348 --> 01:44:25.432
What's wrong?

01:44:30.729 --> 01:44:33.732
I think the Lord spoke to me last night.

01:44:47.579 --> 01:44:49.081
Well, what'd he say?

01:44:53.085 --> 01:44:54.711
He showed me a vision.

01:44:56.338 --> 01:44:57.339
Of you.

01:44:57.923 --> 01:45:00.843
Winning
the heavyweight championship again.

01:45:05.389 --> 01:45:06.890
I can't explain it.

01:45:09.142 --> 01:45:10.143
It's like...

01:45:11.979 --> 01:45:16.024
he's gonna lift you up
in the middle of that ring,

01:45:16.024 --> 01:45:19.528
so you'll lift him up
in front of millions of people.

01:45:41.175 --> 01:45:42.593
How you feeling?

01:45:44.887 --> 01:45:45.888
I feel good.

01:45:46.597 --> 01:45:48.182
This is for real tonight.

01:45:49.558 --> 01:45:52.769
It's time to wake up that old tiger
and put him back to work.

01:45:54.438 --> 01:45:55.814
That man's gone, Doc.

01:45:57.274 --> 01:45:59.026
We gonna do this a new way now.

01:45:59.026 --> 01:46:01.153
Son, there's no new way
when it come to that ring.

01:46:01.945 --> 01:46:03.614
There's him and there's you.

01:46:03.614 --> 01:46:05.824
There's hurt or be hurt.

01:46:06.742 --> 01:46:08.493
- It's fighting.
- It's boxing.

01:46:10.454 --> 01:46:11.455
It's a sport.

01:46:12.706 --> 01:46:13.707
With rules.

01:46:18.545 --> 01:46:20.214
Better know what you're doing.

01:46:39.775 --> 01:46:44.279
It's been ten years since George Foreman
set foot in a boxing ring.

01:46:44.279 --> 01:46:48.033
What does
this Foreman reincarnation even look like?

01:46:48.033 --> 01:46:51.995
Hey, Zouski's no world champion,
but he's a seasoned fighter,

01:46:51.995 --> 01:46:53.956
and George has danger in there tonight.

01:46:53.956 --> 01:46:56.375
You know what scares me
the most about tonight?

01:46:56.375 --> 01:46:57.709
Getting knocked out by a bum?

01:46:58.377 --> 01:46:59.211
No.

01:46:59.920 --> 01:47:02.256
Taking my robe off
in front of all these people.

01:47:02.881 --> 01:47:05.425
The last time they saw me,
I looked like Superman.

01:47:05.425 --> 01:47:09.054
So now you look like the Michelin Man.
This ain't no beauty contest.

01:47:16.436 --> 01:47:17.479
All right!

01:47:27.614 --> 01:47:31.201
Gentlemen, I gave you instructions
in the dressing room.

01:47:31.201 --> 01:47:33.412
Obey my commands.

01:47:33.412 --> 01:47:36.540
Give me a good clean fight. George...

01:47:36.540 --> 01:47:39.543
Don't look at him.
He's trying to mess with your mind.

01:47:39.543 --> 01:47:40.627
Touch them up.

01:47:41.420 --> 01:47:42.713
Come on, let's go.

01:47:47.885 --> 01:47:52.472
So George Foreman begins
the most unlikely of comebacks.

01:47:52.472 --> 01:47:55.309
- All right, George.
- Keep your hands up. Keep your hands up.

01:47:58.020 --> 01:48:00.522
This Sacramento crowd is getting restless.

01:48:00.522 --> 01:48:03.358
- Quit dancing!
- They're looking for some action.

01:48:08.322 --> 01:48:09.907
Stop playing with him.

01:48:14.119 --> 01:48:16.496
You come here to fight
or you wanna go home? Come on!

01:48:17.164 --> 01:48:18.916
Let's do this. Let's fight.
You wanna fight?

01:48:26.340 --> 01:48:27.716
There it is.

01:48:31.178 --> 01:48:33.055
Cheap shot after the bell.

01:48:50.697 --> 01:48:51.740
Let him out.

01:48:53.242 --> 01:48:56.036
It's now or never.
You let him out. Let him out.

01:48:56.036 --> 01:48:57.663
I'm gonna do this my way, Doc.

01:48:59.331 --> 01:49:00.707
I'm gonna do it my way.

01:49:15.180 --> 01:49:18.517
I'll tell you this,
George can still punch.

01:49:23.397 --> 01:49:25.983
Come on! Hit him like you hit Frazier!

01:49:30.404 --> 01:49:32.990
Finish him!

01:49:35.826 --> 01:49:38.495
He has Zouski in huge trouble.

01:49:38.495 --> 01:49:40.205
Yeah, that's it. That's it.

01:49:41.290 --> 01:49:43.584
Come on, man.
Can't you see he's hurt? Stop the fight.

01:49:43.584 --> 01:49:45.085
Do your job. Come on.

01:49:46.295 --> 01:49:47.462
Do your job.

01:49:48.255 --> 01:49:49.882
Come on, George.

01:49:53.635 --> 01:49:57.639
- That's enough. That's enough.
- And it's done. The ref has seen enough.

01:49:57.639 --> 01:50:01.435
Foreman takes his first step back
with a big win.

01:50:11.111 --> 01:50:13.906
Let's hear it
for fat, old, bald guys, huh?

01:50:13.906 --> 01:50:16.158
Yeah! Go get them, George!

01:50:18.160 --> 01:50:21.663
<i>That rumble you hear is
the George Foreman Comeback Express.</i>

01:50:21.663 --> 01:50:24.625
<i>You best believe
it's picking up some serious steam.</i>

01:50:24.625 --> 01:50:26.043
<i>There's an old saying:</i>

01:50:26.043 --> 01:50:28.045
<i>"It's not the size
of the man in the fight,</i>

01:50:28.045 --> 01:50:30.422
<i>but the size of the fight in the man."</i>

01:50:30.422 --> 01:50:34.009
<i>All those ring experts
who were making fun of George's size</i>

01:50:34.009 --> 01:50:35.844
<i>sure aren't laughing anymore.</i>

01:50:36.678 --> 01:50:40.390
<i>Foreman is forcing the boxing world
to stand up and pay attention.</i>

01:50:41.058 --> 01:50:44.853
<i>Never before has a boxer stayed away
from the ring this long,</i>

01:50:44.853 --> 01:50:46.855
<i>then fought his way back into contention.</i>

01:50:46.855 --> 01:50:50.234
<i>Just how far, how high can he take this?</i>

01:50:55.989 --> 01:50:59.660
Back tonight, please welcome
former heavyweight champion of the world,

01:50:59.660 --> 01:51:01.078
George Foreman.

01:51:02.663 --> 01:51:04.540
- Good to see you, George.
- Good to see you.

01:51:06.083 --> 01:51:07.709
Now, tell me, George,

01:51:07.709 --> 01:51:11.046
all these guys you've been fighting,
where do you find them?

01:51:11.046 --> 01:51:14.800
Gas stations, barrooms,
and bowling alleys, mostly.

01:51:16.426 --> 01:51:19.263
- Sounds like pretty stiff competition.
- Oh, yeah.

01:51:19.263 --> 01:51:21.807
But I'm tired of people saying
I'll only fight these guys

01:51:21.807 --> 01:51:24.768
unless they on respirators,
'cause that's a lie.

01:51:24.768 --> 01:51:28.146
They gotta be off the respirator
at least five days before I fight them.

01:51:29.481 --> 01:51:31.233
Now, tell us about your sons, George.

01:51:31.233 --> 01:51:32.484
I got four boys.

01:51:32.484 --> 01:51:34.528
Now, the names are, again...?

01:51:34.528 --> 01:51:39.074
George Foreman Jr., George Foreman III,
George Foreman IV, and George Foreman V.

01:51:39.700 --> 01:51:43.537
I wanted them all to have something
in common. No different names.

01:51:43.537 --> 01:51:45.956
If one goes up, we all go up.

01:51:45.956 --> 01:51:48.667
If one gets in trouble,
we all get in trouble.

01:51:48.667 --> 01:51:49.751
How about that?

01:51:51.128 --> 01:51:54.381
You're going to fight Evander Holyfield
in Atlantic City, right?

01:51:54.381 --> 01:51:55.465
Yes!

01:51:55.465 --> 01:51:59.052
It is my destiny to win
the heavyweight championship belt again.

01:51:59.052 --> 01:52:00.679
It is time, kids!

01:52:02.514 --> 01:52:04.433
Okay, all right. Here we go.

01:52:06.602 --> 01:52:09.021
<i>And we're back for the seventh round.</i>

01:52:09.021 --> 01:52:11.732
<i>Holyfield, as expected,
is well ahead on the cards.</i>

01:52:11.732 --> 01:52:12.816
Your will, Lord.

01:52:14.151 --> 01:52:17.070
<i>And he rocks Foreman again
with a vicious left.</i>

01:52:18.280 --> 01:52:21.033
<i>George is still standing.
But for how long?</i>

01:52:22.367 --> 01:52:24.286
<i>It's Foreman on the attack now.</i>

01:52:25.078 --> 01:52:26.496
That's it, George.

01:52:27.664 --> 01:52:30.125
<i>What a shot! Holyfield is wobbly.</i>

01:52:31.084 --> 01:52:34.880
<i>Solid punches! Nobody thought
Foreman would even last this long.</i>

01:52:36.048 --> 01:52:38.258
- Get him.
<i>- A round for the ages.</i>

01:52:38.258 --> 01:52:41.136
<i>George Foreman is for real.</i>

01:52:41.136 --> 01:52:43.305
<i>And the crowd is up on its feet.</i>

01:52:43.305 --> 01:52:49.311
<i>117 to 100,
for the winner by unanimous decision,</i>

01:52:49.311 --> 01:52:55.025
<i>and still undisputed heavyweight champion
of the world,</i>

01:52:55.025 --> 01:53:00.280
<i>Evander Holyfield.</i>

01:53:02.866 --> 01:53:04.284
Mr. Foreman.

01:53:05.911 --> 01:53:06.954
Great fight.

01:53:06.954 --> 01:53:09.164
One more round
and you would have had him.

01:53:09.164 --> 01:53:10.082
Thank you.

01:53:15.337 --> 01:53:16.421
Have a seat.

01:53:20.926 --> 01:53:22.177
Good morning.

01:53:22.177 --> 01:53:23.512
What brings you in today?

01:53:23.512 --> 01:53:26.223
I just wanna stay
on top of things this time.

01:53:26.849 --> 01:53:29.434
- Did the HBO check come in?
- Just this morning.

01:53:30.102 --> 01:53:33.272
They said they were hoping
to just break even on the fight.

01:53:40.404 --> 01:53:41.405
What?

01:53:52.624 --> 01:53:54.918
I think you'll enjoy
the rest of your statement too.

01:53:54.918 --> 01:53:56.837
That funny little grill deal you signed

01:53:56.837 --> 01:53:59.715
is starting to generate
some substantial checks.

01:53:59.715 --> 01:54:00.841
Really?

01:54:00.841 --> 01:54:04.136
I'm just surprised
they chose a big, old fat guy like me

01:54:04.136 --> 01:54:06.096
to sell a grill to help people get lean.

01:54:06.680 --> 01:54:07.764
The youth center?

01:54:07.764 --> 01:54:11.268
There's enough money in the account
to keep it open a very long time.

01:54:11.935 --> 01:54:14.605
I think it's safe to say you never have
to fight again, Mr. Foreman.

01:54:15.647 --> 01:54:17.566
Oh, praise the Lord.

01:54:22.696 --> 01:54:23.822
What is it?

01:54:26.909 --> 01:54:28.410
Our job isn't over.

01:54:31.997 --> 01:54:34.041
Maybe I heard him wrong, George.

01:54:35.918 --> 01:54:37.336
You heard him right.

01:54:39.087 --> 01:54:40.088
Your vision...

01:54:43.050 --> 01:54:44.676
it was real.

01:54:45.511 --> 01:54:46.845
He did his part.

01:54:47.679 --> 01:54:49.806
We have to do ours.

01:55:00.025 --> 01:55:01.860
<i>The fight is on.</i>

01:55:01.860 --> 01:55:04.655
<i>Three years after he lost
to Evander Holyfield,</i>

01:55:04.655 --> 01:55:07.449
<i>Big George Foreman,
who's now 45 years old,</i>

01:55:07.449 --> 01:55:10.661
<i>has fought his way back to a title fight.</i>

01:55:10.661 --> 01:55:13.330
<i>But he might wanna be careful
what he wishes for.</i>

01:55:13.330 --> 01:55:17.209
<i>Michael Moorer, the newly-minted
heavyweight champion of the world.</i>

01:55:17.209 --> 01:55:19.711
<i>A new champion, in his prime,</i>

01:55:19.711 --> 01:55:23.465
<i>with speed, power, and a fluid arsenal.</i>

01:55:24.842 --> 01:55:28.637
<i>Thirty of Moorer's 35 wins
have come by knockout.</i>

01:55:28.637 --> 01:55:30.764
<i>He is very difficult to fight.</i>

01:55:31.431 --> 01:55:34.268
<i>The first southpaw champion
in heavyweight history,</i>

01:55:34.268 --> 01:55:36.979
<i>and he boasts a win
over Evander Holyfield,</i>

01:55:36.979 --> 01:55:39.022
<i>who battered Big George.</i>

01:55:39.022 --> 01:55:43.443
<i>There has never been
a 45-year-old heavyweight champion.</i>

01:55:43.443 --> 01:55:46.655
<i>The risk here
to George Foreman isn't losing,</i>

01:55:46.655 --> 01:55:48.031
<i>it's surviving.</i>

01:55:48.031 --> 01:55:49.408
How can you beat that man?

01:56:28.238 --> 01:56:29.740
Get out of the pocket.

01:56:33.744 --> 01:56:34.578
Come on, now.

01:56:38.415 --> 01:56:40.834
Looks like the myth
of George Foreman's power

01:56:40.834 --> 01:56:43.253
is being exposed by Moorer so far.

01:56:44.796 --> 01:56:46.215
Come on, son. What are you doing?

01:56:46.215 --> 01:56:48.300
Solid right hand by Moorer.

01:56:48.300 --> 01:56:51.386
<i>Foreman's taking a beating,
way behind on every scorecard.</i>

01:56:51.386 --> 01:56:53.680
<i>Every time George lands
something significant,</i>

01:56:53.680 --> 01:56:56.517
<i>Moorer comes back
with two or three punches of his own.</i>

01:56:56.517 --> 01:57:00.020
<i>He's having a difficult time
with the younger and faster fighter.</i>

01:57:00.020 --> 01:57:01.355
<i>George has no timing.</i>

01:57:01.355 --> 01:57:05.234
<i>He's very slow and sluggish.
I thought he'd be sharper than this.</i>

01:57:08.529 --> 01:57:10.948
Moorer's cutting up George like a turkey.

01:57:13.534 --> 01:57:14.743
Our guy's got nothing left.

01:57:14.743 --> 01:57:16.787
Easy. Easy.

01:57:16.787 --> 01:57:19.331
Foreman's left eye beginning to close.

01:57:19.331 --> 01:57:21.750
Well, now he just looks so tired, Jim.

01:57:23.418 --> 01:57:25.212
He deserves all the credit in the world,

01:57:25.212 --> 01:57:28.924
but he is a 45-year-old man
in a young man's game.

01:57:35.055 --> 01:57:38.725
Uppercut by Moorer,
blasted Foreman's chin backward.

01:57:42.479 --> 01:57:44.523
Oh, God. Protect him.

01:57:58.871 --> 01:58:01.123
<i>I've been fighting all my life.</i>

01:58:04.835 --> 01:58:06.503
<i>For a long time,</i>

01:58:06.503 --> 01:58:09.173
<i>I fought
because I felt hated by the world.</i>

01:58:11.341 --> 01:58:13.051
Poor-man!

01:58:20.184 --> 01:58:22.269
<i>I call it the "Ghetto Whopper."</i>

01:58:22.269 --> 01:58:24.938
<i>I will fight George Foreman
anywhere, any time.</i>

01:58:37.576 --> 01:58:38.994
<i>But I've changed.</i>

01:58:41.830 --> 01:58:45.083
Nine rounds against the best in the world.

01:58:45.083 --> 01:58:48.086
There's no shame, son. No shame.

01:58:48.086 --> 01:58:50.005
He's all right. He's all right.

01:58:54.301 --> 01:58:55.427
You okay?

01:59:10.776 --> 01:59:12.611
Come on, George. Come on.

01:59:21.662 --> 01:59:24.915
<i>I had to get knocked down
all the way to the bottom</i>

01:59:24.915 --> 01:59:26.083
<i>to finally see...</i>

01:59:29.294 --> 01:59:33.131
<i>everything I was searching for
was already there.</i>

01:59:44.893 --> 01:59:45.936
<i>And with that...</i>

01:59:47.729 --> 01:59:50.566
<i>you can do the impossible.</i>

01:59:56.530 --> 01:59:58.532
Down goes Moorer on a right hand!

01:59:58.532 --> 02:00:01.410
An unbelievably close-in, right-hand shot.

02:00:04.913 --> 02:00:07.833
- I don't believe it.
- It happened!

02:00:07.833 --> 02:00:10.169
Five. Six.

02:00:10.169 --> 02:00:12.754
- Stay down. Stay down.
<i>- Seven.</i>

02:00:12.754 --> 02:00:16.675
Eight. Nine. Ten.

02:00:17.926 --> 02:00:19.344
It happened!

02:00:20.762 --> 02:00:24.099
George Foreman is
the new heavyweight champ of the world.

02:00:33.066 --> 02:00:35.569
The boxer turned preacher
is down on his knees,

02:00:35.569 --> 02:00:39.072
not in defeat,
but in victory and thanksgiving.

02:00:55.047 --> 02:00:56.089
Thank you.

02:00:56.840 --> 02:00:58.050
No, thank you.

02:00:59.259 --> 02:01:01.220
You're the heavyweight champion
of the world.

02:01:01.970 --> 02:01:05.807
- We did it.
- We did it.

02:01:10.938 --> 02:01:11.939
We did it.

02:01:23.617 --> 02:01:29.331
I have never seen anything like this
in the 25 years of my career, Gil.

02:01:29.331 --> 02:01:34.419
Oldest heavyweight champion
in the world ever, George Foreman.
