01:20.613 --> 01:21.713
Hey,
            Bob.
Hey, Ton.

01:21.781 --> 01:23.080
How you doing?

01:23.148 --> 01:25.449
Hey, I saw the greatest
    hockey game of all time.

01:25.517 --> 01:26.651
ELAINE:
Yeah?

01:26.719 --> 01:27.818
Last night...

01:27.887 --> 01:28.987
Thank you.

01:29.054 --> 01:30.889
It was between the Islanders
        and the Flyers.

01:30.956 --> 01:32.623
They scored 13 goals
          in the game,

01:32.691 --> 01:34.792
and there must have been
   200 minutes of penalties.

01:34.860 --> 01:36.228
Oh...
   Fight. Man, was it rough.

01:36.295 --> 01:37.562
Unbelievable.
Wow.

01:37.629 --> 01:38.897
Phooey.

01:38.964 --> 01:41.299
I think Latka's got
a different angle on that, Tony.

01:41.367 --> 01:43.301
In fact,
       here he comes now.

01:43.369 --> 01:46.070
Tony, did you ever think why

01:46.138 --> 01:49.608
I don't go to the hockey games
           with you?

01:49.675 --> 01:51.543
'Cause I don't invite you,
             Latka?

01:51.644 --> 01:53.878
Not even close.

01:53.946 --> 01:57.582
Is because the hockey players
 in your country are cupcakes.

01:57.649 --> 01:58.950
TONY:
What are you...?

01:59.018 --> 02:01.619
What are you talking
about, Latka?

02:01.686 --> 02:02.954
The hockey players
        in this country

02:03.022 --> 02:04.455
are the toughest in the world.

02:04.523 --> 02:06.490
No, they are cupcakes.

02:06.559 --> 02:09.493
They have to wear the helmets

02:09.562 --> 02:12.764
and the mask and the padding.

02:14.100 --> 02:16.233
In my country,
       they wear nothing.

02:16.301 --> 02:18.035
Oh. You mean,
                     no padding?

02:18.070 --> 02:19.904
I mean no clothes.

02:21.407 --> 02:24.175
Well, I guess that allows them
        to skate faster.

02:24.242 --> 02:25.576
No skates.

02:25.644 --> 02:26.811
No skates?

02:26.879 --> 02:28.980
What do they do,
     slide around the ice?

02:29.015 --> 02:30.815
No ice. Gravel.

02:30.883 --> 02:33.551
Latka, why don't you get lost
  with this stupid stuff, huh?

02:33.586 --> 02:34.586
Is true.

02:34.653 --> 02:36.754
Is stupid.

02:36.889 --> 02:40.659
You call my-my stupid stuff
is stupid stuff?

02:40.726 --> 02:41.959
Yeah.
I think is not.

02:42.027 --> 02:43.561
I think your stupid stuff

02:43.629 --> 02:47.265
is stupid stuff, and you calling
 my stuff is not stupid stuff.

02:49.335 --> 02:51.603
Why don't you shut up,
          huh, Latka?

02:51.671 --> 02:53.538
Why don't you shut up?

02:57.910 --> 03:00.478
Latka, you shut up, or
        I'm gonna knock you out.

03:00.545 --> 03:01.813
How's that?

03:01.880 --> 03:04.115
No!

03:04.182 --> 03:07.218
Because you cannot knock me out.

03:07.286 --> 03:10.855
Because, if you do,
nobody is going to like you,

03:10.922 --> 03:13.424
because I am weak

03:13.492 --> 03:15.826
and defenseless
and-and cute.

03:19.899 --> 03:21.733
Well, then, shut up!

03:21.867 --> 03:23.301
Shut up.
                        Shut up!

03:23.369 --> 03:24.803
Shut up.

03:24.870 --> 03:25.970
Shut up!

03:26.038 --> 03:27.605
Shut up.

03:27.673 --> 03:29.641
See? I am winning this argument.

03:32.211 --> 03:33.411
I'll tell you what
                   we do, Latka.

03:33.479 --> 03:34.679
Let's cut the
               cards, all right?

03:34.746 --> 03:36.480
Low card shuts up
               for a whole hour.

03:36.515 --> 03:38.816
How about a whole day?

03:38.951 --> 03:40.018
How about a whole week?

03:40.085 --> 03:41.652
How about
seven days?

03:41.720 --> 03:43.388
You got it.

03:43.456 --> 03:45.357
Okay, low card

03:45.424 --> 03:47.191
shuts up
    for a whole seven days.

03:47.259 --> 03:48.392
Okay.

03:48.461 --> 03:49.761
I got a queen.

03:49.829 --> 03:51.228
Well, okay.

03:51.296 --> 03:53.031
I got a...

03:54.299 --> 03:56.233
Oh.

03:58.971 --> 04:00.571
Boy, is it
                  gonna be great

04:00.639 --> 04:02.406
not hearing from
            this guy for a week.

04:02.474 --> 04:04.475
Ha. 'Cause I get
           kind of tired of him.

04:04.543 --> 04:06.477
I'll tell you
                      the truth.

04:11.450 --> 04:14.519
Hey, Jim,
            how you doing?

04:14.587 --> 04:18.055
Uh, I-I'll get back
          to you on that, Bobby.

04:24.996 --> 04:28.533
Can I talk to you
for a minute in private, Alex?

04:28.601 --> 04:30.501
Oh, yeah, yeah, sure, Jim.

04:31.570 --> 04:33.604
Excuse us.

04:33.672 --> 04:37.441
Uh, I've got terrible
             news for you, Alex.

04:37.509 --> 04:39.410
What is it, Jim?
What is it?

04:39.478 --> 04:40.845
(sighs)

04:40.913 --> 04:42.180
You're going to die.

04:43.282 --> 04:45.449
We're all going to die, Jim.

04:45.517 --> 04:48.086
Well, yeah,
                  yeah, but, uh,

04:48.187 --> 04:51.388
not on Thursday, we're not.

04:51.424 --> 04:53.291
Well, what the hell
are you talking about?

04:53.359 --> 04:57.027
I-I-I-I... I had a
          dream about you, Alex.

04:57.095 --> 04:59.330
A terrible, terrible dream.

04:59.398 --> 05:00.498
Oh, a dream!

05:00.566 --> 05:03.134
Hey, come on. A dream--
what's the big deal, Jim?

05:03.201 --> 05:05.069
Alex, please
                   listen to me.

05:05.137 --> 05:07.538
I have dreams-- dreams
                 that come true.

05:07.606 --> 05:08.739
You mean you're psychic?

05:08.841 --> 05:11.876
Yeah, yeah, I... I'm psychic.

05:11.944 --> 05:14.012
I didn't tell
                you guys about
                it before

05:14.079 --> 05:15.846
because I
                didn't want
                you to think

05:15.915 --> 05:19.117
I was offbeat
                or something.

05:20.953 --> 05:24.122
So what was your dream
          about Alex?

05:24.190 --> 05:26.123
Well, it-it...
        it was horrible.

05:27.592 --> 05:30.228
It's gonna
                   happen to you

05:30.296 --> 05:33.230
Thursday night at
                 your apartment.

05:33.298 --> 05:34.999
You'll be with a friend.

05:35.067 --> 05:37.702
I couldn't make out who.

05:37.770 --> 05:41.305
You'll drink a glass
          of water very quickly.

05:41.373 --> 05:44.042
Somebody is going to
         mistake you for a girl.

05:44.110 --> 05:46.210
You'll do the cancan

05:46.312 --> 05:48.746
in a green shirt,
       wearing a catcher's mask.

05:48.813 --> 05:51.582
And then comes
                 the crazy part.

05:51.650 --> 05:54.352
Oh?

05:54.420 --> 05:56.988
There'll be a
              knock at the door.

05:57.055 --> 05:59.490
You'll go to the door.

05:59.557 --> 06:01.558
You'll open it...

06:03.562 --> 06:04.595
And what?

06:04.663 --> 06:06.096
What? What? What?
         What happens?

06:06.164 --> 06:07.398
That's the end.

06:07.465 --> 06:09.767
The end of the dream,
or the end of me?

06:09.835 --> 06:10.935
Both.

06:11.003 --> 06:13.638
(sobbing)

06:13.706 --> 06:14.873
Jim, hey.

06:14.940 --> 06:16.774
Oh, Jim, it's okay.
           It's okay.

06:16.842 --> 06:20.311
And you know
    what the worst part is?

06:20.379 --> 06:22.379
The worst part is

06:22.447 --> 06:25.817
that between now and the end,
 you're going to be at Mario's,

06:25.884 --> 06:30.487
and a beautiful, sexy blonde
is going to fall into your arms.

06:30.555 --> 06:35.026
You'll be dating each other
      right up to the end.

06:35.094 --> 06:37.228
All this is going to happen
    in the next three days?

06:37.295 --> 06:40.931
Hey, hey, hey, Jim, Jim,
           don't worry about it.

06:41.000 --> 06:43.634
I tell you, Alex,
I'm psychic.

06:43.702 --> 06:45.536
Well, you might be
          psychic, but remember,

06:45.604 --> 06:47.171
you know, psychics
            aren't always right.

06:47.238 --> 06:48.439
Uh...

06:48.441 --> 06:50.474
That's right.

06:50.542 --> 06:52.110
So why don't
    you cheer up?

06:52.177 --> 06:53.778
Yeah. Hey, Jim,
I'll tell you what.

06:53.846 --> 06:56.747
I'll take you to Mario's,
 and I'll buy you a beer, huh?

06:56.849 --> 06:58.049
Uh, it's gonna take more

06:58.116 --> 07:00.184
than a beer
to do away with this.

07:00.285 --> 07:01.352
BOBBY:
Ah.

07:01.419 --> 07:03.587
This is a job
for a couple of six-packs.

07:03.655 --> 07:04.889
ELAINE:
Oh.

07:04.956 --> 07:05.923
You got it.

07:05.991 --> 07:07.292
We can shoot for that.

07:07.392 --> 07:09.126
You got it.

07:09.194 --> 07:10.661
After you, my lady.

07:11.796 --> 07:14.065
Reiger, I got to talk to you.

07:14.132 --> 07:15.065
What?

07:15.133 --> 07:16.634
I advise you not
to take this lightly.

07:16.702 --> 07:18.369
What do you mean? That
         thing about that dream?

07:18.436 --> 07:20.270
Now, come on, Louie.
Now, listen
to me, Reiger.

07:20.338 --> 07:22.507
You don't understand this
           like I do

07:22.575 --> 07:25.109
because you don't have religion.

07:25.144 --> 07:27.811
Now let me
explain it to you.

07:27.913 --> 07:30.014
You heard of God, right?

07:30.049 --> 07:31.115
Rings a bell.

07:32.818 --> 07:36.688
Well, God gave every human being
        a special gift.

07:36.755 --> 07:38.990
To you, he gave smarts.

07:39.058 --> 07:40.358
Banta's got muscle.

07:40.459 --> 07:43.828
Nardo's got knobs.

07:43.896 --> 07:45.930
Wheeler's got hair.

07:45.997 --> 07:47.664
And you know
what he gave me?

07:47.733 --> 07:49.867
It's not immediately apparent,
                          Louie.

07:49.935 --> 07:54.505
God gave me the power to spot
what everybody else has got.

07:54.573 --> 07:55.639
Oh.

07:55.774 --> 07:58.576
All right. When you first look
at Ignatowski,

07:58.711 --> 08:02.213
you figure this guy must have
    caught God on a bad day.

08:02.280 --> 08:05.783
But let me tell you something.

08:05.851 --> 08:08.285
Ignatowski is different from us.

08:08.353 --> 08:12.022
The way that man's mind works,
I believe he can see the future.

08:12.091 --> 08:13.891
He scares the hell
out of me.

08:13.926 --> 08:16.026
Oh, come on, Louie.

08:16.094 --> 08:20.330
All right,
 if you won't listen to reason,

08:20.398 --> 08:23.801
can I at least give you
       a little blessing

08:23.869 --> 08:26.771
to protect you
     from his evil dreams?

08:30.275 --> 08:32.443
All right.

08:33.312 --> 08:35.645
(rapid spitting sounds)

08:39.017 --> 08:41.318
Thanks, Louie.

08:51.730 --> 08:53.497
I can't believe it.

08:53.565 --> 08:55.599
Louie is taking Jim's dream
           seriously.

08:55.668 --> 08:56.868
Hey.
            (laughs)

08:56.935 --> 08:58.803
Don't knock
                       it, Alex.

08:58.871 --> 09:00.938
This is the place where
      the beautiful, sexy blonde

09:01.006 --> 09:02.539
is supposed to fall
                 into your arms.

09:02.607 --> 09:03.807
Oh, yeah.

09:03.875 --> 09:04.909
Yeah, well, so far,

09:04.976 --> 09:06.944
the only sexy blonde
                  in here is me.

09:11.684 --> 09:12.950
(mutters)
Latka.

09:13.018 --> 09:14.751
ELAINE:
Hello.
Well, hi, Latka.

09:23.329 --> 09:24.862
Hello, Latka.

09:27.733 --> 09:29.634
ELAINE:
Hello, Latka.

09:35.907 --> 09:37.141
What, Latka?

09:42.281 --> 09:43.715
That's it!
             Tony!

09:43.782 --> 09:46.717
Oh, come on!

09:46.785 --> 09:48.552
Okay?

09:55.461 --> 09:56.460
Howdy.

09:56.528 --> 09:58.896
Oh. Hi, Jim.

09:58.964 --> 10:00.431
How are you
                     doing, pal?

10:00.499 --> 10:01.966
Uh, fine,
        just fine, Jim.

10:02.034 --> 10:03.367
You know,
                 (clears throat)

10:03.435 --> 10:05.369
when people are gone,

10:05.404 --> 10:07.738
you always wish
    you treated them better.

10:09.341 --> 10:11.709
I'm not going
     to wish that with you.

10:11.777 --> 10:15.613
Alex, I'm gonna treat you
       to dinner tonight.

10:15.681 --> 10:17.381
Huh?
                           Steak

10:17.449 --> 10:18.516
with all the trimmings

10:18.584 --> 10:20.651
and a bottle
     of Mario's best wine.

10:20.719 --> 10:22.619
No, no, no, you don't have
to do that, Jim.

10:22.687 --> 10:24.555
No, I want to.
Yeah...

10:24.622 --> 10:27.658
I saved up enough money
     after quitting drugs.

10:27.726 --> 10:29.527
(clears throat)

10:29.594 --> 10:32.196
And I want
    to spend it all on you.

10:33.565 --> 10:35.866
Jim, that's
a dollar, 35.

10:37.836 --> 10:40.637
I quit drugs for
                   a dollar, 35?

10:42.707 --> 10:45.575
What was I thinking of?

10:45.643 --> 10:46.977
No, no, no, no.

10:47.046 --> 10:49.047
Jim, you also quit
for your health

10:49.114 --> 10:50.881
and your state of mind.

10:50.916 --> 10:51.916
Oh, yeah, yeah.

10:51.983 --> 10:53.016
That's all right, Jim.

10:53.084 --> 10:54.585
You don't have
to buy me dinner.

10:54.720 --> 10:55.719
Besides, I already ate.

10:55.787 --> 10:57.354
Why don't you get us
    another pitcher of beer?

10:57.456 --> 10:58.422
ELAINE:
Yeah, good idea.

10:58.489 --> 11:00.191
Okeydoke.
All right?

11:02.593 --> 11:04.462
Good.

11:04.529 --> 11:07.765
You know, I
                don't know about
                the rest of you,

11:07.833 --> 11:09.700
but Jim's giving
                  me the chills.

11:09.768 --> 11:11.035
What, more so
        than usual?

11:11.102 --> 11:12.336
Oh, I don't
                      know about

11:12.404 --> 11:13.538
this dream stuff

11:13.605 --> 11:15.473
with the catcher's mask
        and the blonde.

11:15.541 --> 11:18.943
I mean, it's crazy,
    but with Jim, who knows?

11:19.011 --> 11:21.111
Maybe this guy can see
        into the future.

11:21.179 --> 11:23.748
He definitely can't see anything
        in the present.

11:23.816 --> 11:25.283
Hey, you know some...

11:25.350 --> 11:27.518
I just remembered something.

11:27.586 --> 11:31.054
You know, once Jim refused
      to take out a certain cab,

11:31.122 --> 11:34.492
and the guy that took it
       out got into an accident.

11:34.560 --> 11:35.626
I heard about that.

11:35.694 --> 11:37.261
That was Ernie Lotes,
           and he got

11:37.329 --> 11:39.163
into a little fender bender
        on 38th Street.

11:39.231 --> 11:40.531
It doesn't mean a thing.

11:40.598 --> 11:42.166
Yeah, yeah,
     but, Alex, who knows?

11:42.234 --> 11:45.736
If Jim had taken out the cab,
it might have been a lot worse.

11:45.804 --> 11:46.803
ELAINE:
You know something?

11:46.871 --> 11:48.506
I just thought
of something myself.

11:48.607 --> 11:51.108
Last winter,
I was very worried

11:51.176 --> 11:52.809
about Jason's grades,
right, in school?

11:52.877 --> 11:54.645
And-And Jim told me
not to worry

11:54.712 --> 11:56.480
because the next day
on his test,

11:56.548 --> 11:58.615
he was going to get an 86.

11:58.683 --> 11:59.917
And he got an 86.

11:59.984 --> 12:01.385
(whistles)

12:01.487 --> 12:02.853
ELAINE:
No, no, no,
I'm wrong.

12:02.921 --> 12:05.789
He said he was going
to get an 87.

12:05.824 --> 12:07.524
And he got an 87.

12:07.592 --> 12:09.659
Uh-oh.

12:11.630 --> 12:13.497
Hey,

12:13.565 --> 12:15.399
I just remembered
                 something, too!

12:15.467 --> 12:17.869
He told me...
 Listen, can we just drop this
           right now?

12:17.936 --> 12:20.705
This conversation is going
    nowhere, you know that?

12:20.772 --> 12:22.840
Superstitions are idiotic.

12:22.908 --> 12:24.107
We're just talking.

12:24.175 --> 12:25.176
Yeah, but it's silly,
        and I don't want

12:25.243 --> 12:26.510
to be silly tonight, all right?

12:26.578 --> 12:28.178
What are you coming
                 down on us for?

12:28.213 --> 12:29.647
I don't know, can we-- can we
   change the subject please?

12:29.748 --> 12:31.082
Okay.
           Thank you.

12:31.150 --> 12:32.950
Hey, what are you doing?

12:33.085 --> 12:35.586
Well, so I got a little bit
           of beer on your suit.

12:35.653 --> 12:37.588
Not such a great
                   suit, anyway.

12:37.655 --> 12:40.857
Better than anything
you're wearing... jerk.

12:40.925 --> 12:42.760
Who are you calling
                  a jerk, you...

12:42.828 --> 12:45.763
You heard me,
    I'm calling you a jerk.

12:57.843 --> 12:59.276
I'm terribly sorry.

12:59.344 --> 13:01.746
That's okay, we were
                  expecting you.

13:12.457 --> 13:15.259
¶

13:22.301 --> 13:24.201
Ah, he wants us to...

13:30.843 --> 13:32.543
LATKA:
            Testing.

13:32.611 --> 13:37.515
Abby-dabby, icky-bicky,
    abby-dabby, icky-bicky.

13:37.582 --> 13:38.883
Hello?

13:38.951 --> 13:39.984
Elaine?

13:40.018 --> 13:41.385
Oh, hi, Latka.

13:41.453 --> 13:43.321
My, you're looking
         lovely today.

13:43.422 --> 13:45.555
You're welcome.
              Oh.

13:45.623 --> 13:47.692
Thank you.

13:47.759 --> 13:49.326
Hello, Bobby.

13:49.394 --> 13:50.561
Hi, Latka.

13:50.629 --> 13:52.630
How is your career
                   coming along?

13:52.731 --> 13:54.231
Well fine, as a matter
           of fact...

13:54.298 --> 13:57.000
Sorry to hear that, Bobby.

13:59.438 --> 14:02.139
Hello, Alex.

14:02.207 --> 14:05.275
It's good to see you today,
             Alex.

14:05.343 --> 14:07.444
Tony?

14:08.380 --> 14:10.314
Tony?

14:11.316 --> 14:12.783
Tony?

14:12.918 --> 14:14.085
What?

14:14.152 --> 14:16.987
(blowing raspberry)

14:18.256 --> 14:20.925
(blowing raspberry)
Latka, will you...

14:20.993 --> 14:21.892
Latka, I'm telling you, take...

14:21.960 --> 14:23.894
(blowing raspberry)

14:27.732 --> 14:28.899
Hi.

14:28.967 --> 14:30.934
Hey, Louie, check me out,
      I want to get home.

14:31.003 --> 14:33.470
You know what day this is,
Reiger ?

14:33.538 --> 14:35.272
What is this,
                     a pop quiz?

14:35.407 --> 14:38.042
Alex... what are you gonna do?

14:38.109 --> 14:39.409
What do you mean,
      what am I gonna do?

14:39.477 --> 14:41.044
We're worried
                about you, Alex.

14:41.112 --> 14:43.414
You met that girl at Mario's,
    just like Jim predicted,

14:43.482 --> 14:45.416
and you've been seeing her
           every day,

14:45.484 --> 14:46.884
just like Jim predicted.

14:46.952 --> 14:48.151
And today's Thursday.

14:48.219 --> 14:50.721
Just like Jim
                      predicted.

14:50.822 --> 14:52.356
Well what do you
                expect me to do?

14:52.424 --> 14:54.658
Change my life just because
     of that stupid dream?

14:54.726 --> 14:56.259
Do you expect me
to drop Peggy,

14:56.327 --> 14:57.895
who I happen to like
very much,

14:57.962 --> 15:01.231
just because she fits in
     with this, uh, thing?

15:01.299 --> 15:02.899
Alex, don't you think
        it's a good idea

15:02.967 --> 15:04.735
just to get out of town
           for a day?

15:04.770 --> 15:06.937
Yeah, you've got
nothing to lose.

15:07.005 --> 15:08.472
Elaine, you of all people,

15:08.540 --> 15:10.473
you seriously expect me
     to believe this stuff?

15:10.541 --> 15:12.410
I'm saying to have
an open mind about it.

15:12.477 --> 15:13.643
Aw, please, will you?
                  Come on, Alex,

15:13.711 --> 15:15.279
it's not gonna hurt you
         not to be home tonight.

15:15.347 --> 15:16.713
I'm not saying
                     go to Peru,

15:16.848 --> 15:18.315
but don't rule
                       Peru out.

15:18.382 --> 15:20.017
Will you stop this?

15:20.085 --> 15:21.251
There's no way in the world

15:21.319 --> 15:22.786
you're gonna get me
     to be afraid of this.

15:22.854 --> 15:24.354
I happen to be
      a realistic person.

15:24.422 --> 15:27.357
I always have been,
     and I always will be.

15:27.425 --> 15:28.859
Nobody's trying
                   to scare you.

15:28.927 --> 15:30.327
Another one.

15:30.394 --> 15:32.162
We're just
                  trying to say,

15:32.264 --> 15:34.531
that as sure as there's
                a God in heaven,

15:34.599 --> 15:37.400
you're going belly up
                at 7:00 tonight.

15:37.468 --> 15:39.536
Unless you're not
              in your apartment.

15:39.604 --> 15:42.306
Look, just let me say this.

15:42.374 --> 15:44.808
I don't believe in
       any of this stuff.

15:44.876 --> 15:45.876
But as a matter of fact,

15:45.944 --> 15:47.811
I'm not gonna be
    at my apartment at 7:00,

15:47.846 --> 15:50.247
because I'm going out on a date
with a wonderful woman.

15:50.314 --> 15:51.348
See?

15:51.415 --> 15:52.616
Now is anybody, uh,

15:52.684 --> 15:54.484
foolish enough to be relieved
by any of that?

15:54.552 --> 15:57.821
(overlapping chatter)

15:57.889 --> 15:59.189
All right, that's
                  good planning.

15:59.257 --> 16:01.391
I didn't plan that.

16:01.459 --> 16:03.560
Now if you'll excuse me,
  I'm a little late. Good-bye.

16:03.595 --> 16:04.928
ALL:
Good-bye, Alex.

16:04.963 --> 16:06.797
(overlapping chatter)

16:07.833 --> 16:09.833
(phone ringing)

16:15.573 --> 16:17.507
(grunting)

16:20.812 --> 16:22.712
Cabbie cooties.

16:25.183 --> 16:27.717
Sunshine Cab.

16:27.853 --> 16:29.786
He just walked out the door.

16:29.788 --> 16:32.756
Can I take a message?

16:33.859 --> 16:35.759
Oh, you're the dame

16:35.794 --> 16:38.795
that Reiger's gonna date
         tonight, huh?

16:38.864 --> 16:40.797
No!

16:40.866 --> 16:43.300
No, no, no, no,
       you can't do that.

16:43.368 --> 16:45.302
No, you gotta go out with him.

16:45.370 --> 16:48.305
What reason could you have
 for breaking a date with him?

16:49.774 --> 16:53.710
You got a 104 degree temperature
    and projectile vomiting?

16:55.613 --> 16:58.548
He's had worse dates.

16:59.851 --> 17:01.818
All right, all right.

17:01.820 --> 17:04.820
I'll save the man myself.

17:06.057 --> 17:07.958
Reiger!

17:26.010 --> 17:27.944
(knocking on door)

17:28.012 --> 17:29.446
Yeah.

17:29.513 --> 17:32.416
Yeah, hold on.

17:32.517 --> 17:33.383
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

17:33.451 --> 17:34.651
Come on, Reiger, we gotta
                get out of here.

17:34.719 --> 17:35.819
What are you
talking about?
                   Come on.

17:35.920 --> 17:37.154
Peggy called,

17:37.222 --> 17:39.189
she can't go out and
            you can't stay here.

17:39.257 --> 17:40.824
Come on, we'll go down
                 to 42nd street,

17:40.892 --> 17:42.259
look at weirdos and
            have a cheeseburger.

17:42.294 --> 17:43.561
No, wait a minute.

17:43.628 --> 17:44.795
Wait, wait a minute.

17:44.862 --> 17:46.630
Why can't she make it?
           Forget it, forget it,

17:46.698 --> 17:48.898
being dumped on by a dame is
     the least of your problems.

17:48.966 --> 17:50.434
You've got the Grim
          Reaper to worry about.

17:50.501 --> 17:51.569
We'll go to a movie.
Louie,

17:51.670 --> 17:53.037
will you stop this?
                        Come on.

17:53.104 --> 17:54.438
I'm not gonna go anywhere.

17:55.574 --> 17:57.641
Reiger, the dream's
coming true.

17:57.708 --> 17:59.976
You're here in your apartment,
it's Thursday night,

18:00.045 --> 18:01.978
it's almost 7:00.

18:02.080 --> 18:03.647
All right, look.

18:03.714 --> 18:04.981
All right.
                      (laughing)

18:05.050 --> 18:07.884
I admit your life is nothing
to jump up and down about.

18:08.019 --> 18:10.854
But it must mean
something to you.

18:10.922 --> 18:12.489
Oh, and you think all
       those other things

18:12.557 --> 18:13.624
have come true, huh?

18:13.691 --> 18:15.058
Like drinking a glass
       of water quickly,

18:15.126 --> 18:16.693
being mistaken for a girl?

18:16.761 --> 18:18.495
Dancing the cancan
                in a green shirt

18:18.597 --> 18:20.030
and a catcher's
                           mask.

18:20.065 --> 18:22.166
Oh, and at 7:00,
       precisely at 7:00,

18:22.233 --> 18:24.702
there's a knock at the door,
  and who's on the other side?

18:24.769 --> 18:25.702
Death is on...

18:25.770 --> 18:27.471
(coughing):
                        Death...

18:27.539 --> 18:28.638
Excuse me.

18:28.706 --> 18:30.640
(coughing continues)

18:32.810 --> 18:35.879
(coughing):
That's the silliest
thing I ever heard.

18:35.947 --> 18:37.314
Aha!

18:37.382 --> 18:40.284
Ah-ha-ha-ha!

18:40.385 --> 18:42.018
Ah-ho-ho-ho!

18:42.120 --> 18:43.686
Reiger!

18:43.754 --> 18:45.055
Reiger, what do you say now?

18:45.123 --> 18:47.157
Look what time it is.
       Let's get the hell

18:47.225 --> 18:48.625
out of here!
Boy, come on!

18:48.693 --> 18:50.260
I'm not leaving
                           here.
Come! Come!

18:50.295 --> 18:51.995
Out! Get out!

18:52.063 --> 18:54.064
I'm staying here tonight.
    I'm staying right here.

18:54.132 --> 18:55.165
(phone ringing)

18:55.233 --> 18:56.800
I have no intention of going...

18:59.871 --> 19:01.238
Hello?

19:01.372 --> 19:02.472
No, this is not Mary.

19:02.540 --> 19:03.941
Do I sound like a Mary?

19:04.008 --> 19:05.209
You have the wrong number.

19:05.276 --> 19:07.411
Louie, why don't you just...

19:09.447 --> 19:10.414
Mary?

19:10.481 --> 19:11.748
It's happening!

19:11.816 --> 19:13.516
It's happening!

19:13.584 --> 19:14.551
It's happening!

19:14.618 --> 19:15.986
Come on, out!

19:16.054 --> 19:17.854
Out of here.
            Louie...

19:17.922 --> 19:19.189
No, no, no, no.

19:19.257 --> 19:20.857
No, no, Louie, no, Louie.

19:20.959 --> 19:21.592
Get out!
                        No!

19:21.726 --> 19:23.160
I am not gonna leave
                 this apartment.

19:23.194 --> 19:24.428
If I walk through that door,

19:24.496 --> 19:26.463
I am violating everything
         I believe in.

19:26.531 --> 19:28.365
I'm giving up the control
        of my own life.

19:28.432 --> 19:30.134
The hell with that.

19:30.201 --> 19:31.868
I'm gonna live my future.

19:31.936 --> 19:33.437
I'm not gonna be afraid of it.

19:33.538 --> 19:36.340
Reiger, will you cut
the Joan of Arc stuff?

19:36.407 --> 19:38.342
And don't tempt fate?

19:38.344 --> 19:39.610
Tempt fate,
                          Louie?

19:39.678 --> 19:41.611
No, I'm not gonna
                     tempt fate.

19:41.680 --> 19:43.013
I'm gonna bait fate.

19:43.081 --> 19:44.314
No, no, green!
             Yeah.

19:44.382 --> 19:46.316
Rigger, no green!

19:46.384 --> 19:47.784
No. No, no, Reiger.

19:47.852 --> 19:49.286
Yeah!
        Reiger!

19:49.354 --> 19:50.720
Don't do this, Reiger.

19:50.788 --> 19:53.223
Louie, if I'm gonna die,
       I'm gonna die as I lived.

19:53.291 --> 19:55.425
Dancing the cancan in a green
  shirt and a catcher's mask.

19:55.493 --> 19:57.294
No, no, no,
     don't lift those feet.

19:57.362 --> 19:58.495
Don't, Reiger!
                     (humming)

19:58.563 --> 20:00.430
Reiger, don't do this.

20:00.498 --> 20:02.132
No, Reiger!

20:02.200 --> 20:03.567
It's coming true!

20:03.635 --> 20:05.368
The dream...

20:05.436 --> 20:08.205
(clock chiming)

20:24.823 --> 20:26.756
(whimpering)

20:32.397 --> 20:34.398
Louie...

20:34.400 --> 20:36.633
I didn't die.

20:38.503 --> 20:39.803
(chuckles)

20:42.640 --> 20:44.374
(laughing)

20:48.079 --> 20:50.747
Ignatowski's a boob.

20:53.685 --> 20:55.618
That was a nice cancan.

20:55.687 --> 20:57.620
Thank you.

20:59.624 --> 21:02.426
Now listen, Louie,
                repeat after me.

21:02.493 --> 21:04.527
Superstitions are...

21:04.595 --> 21:06.729
(knocking on door)

21:06.831 --> 21:08.532
Now you did it!

21:08.633 --> 21:10.534
I almost apologized!

21:13.204 --> 21:14.271
Don't you dare!

21:14.338 --> 21:15.638
Don't go near that door!

21:15.706 --> 21:17.307
Reiger, stay away
        from that door!

21:17.375 --> 21:18.942
Louie, I have to see what's on

21:19.010 --> 21:20.411
the other side
                   of that door.
  No! Death is on the other side

21:20.478 --> 21:21.512
of this door.
I don't care, I want to see it!

21:21.579 --> 21:22.312
No!

21:22.380 --> 21:23.280
Louie, get away from the door.
No!

21:23.348 --> 21:24.381
Get away from the door, Lou!
 No!

21:24.516 --> 21:25.282
No, no, Reiger.

21:25.416 --> 21:26.716
No, no, Reiger!
                        (grunts)

21:26.784 --> 21:29.119
No! No!
Louie, get away
from the door!

21:34.559 --> 21:35.692
(screaming)

21:51.042 --> 21:52.275
Reiger, did you see it?

21:52.343 --> 21:53.776
It was hideous!

21:56.647 --> 22:00.517
Louie, it was a little girl
     selling sugar cookies.

22:05.590 --> 22:07.524
My favorite.

22:11.629 --> 22:12.895
Here.

22:12.963 --> 22:14.831
Thanks for coming by, Lou.

22:20.438 --> 22:22.339
One for me and three for you,
              huh?

22:25.042 --> 22:26.977
Look, Reiger...

22:28.513 --> 22:31.414
...I got to make a confession.

22:32.917 --> 22:34.852
I was pretty scared there.

22:36.888 --> 22:38.755
But you...

22:38.823 --> 22:41.758
you got guts.

22:41.826 --> 22:44.060
You're a rock, Reiger.

22:44.162 --> 22:45.895
Good night, Lou.

22:45.964 --> 22:47.197
So long.

23:00.878 --> 23:03.880
Oh my God, a ghost.

23:03.915 --> 23:06.449
Jim, it's me.

23:06.584 --> 23:08.751
A talking ghost.

23:08.853 --> 23:10.721
Jim, I'm not a ghost.

23:10.788 --> 23:12.756
I didn't die.

23:12.824 --> 23:15.125
You may be a psychic,
  but you missed on this one.

23:15.259 --> 23:17.060
A reasonable ghost.

23:17.095 --> 23:18.995
Hey Jeff, give me a cab.

23:19.063 --> 23:20.897
A working ghost.

23:20.932 --> 23:21.999
Bye, Jim.

23:22.066 --> 23:23.200
Have a nice day.

23:23.234 --> 23:24.801
A courteous ghost!

23:34.979 --> 23:37.214
(theme song playing)

24:00.805 --> 24:02.105
WOMAN:
    <i>Good night, Mr. Walters!</i>

24:02.173 --> 24:03.173
(man grumbling)
