00:27.875 --> 00:29.447
Frank Martin.

00:34.781 --> 00:36.571
He wants mine too.

01:08.912 --> 01:10.121
Drive.

01:11.417 --> 01:12.727
Charming.

01:56.008 --> 01:57.188
Stop.

02:10.874 --> 02:12.675
Lovely spot for a holiday.

02:12.944 --> 02:14.110
"Club Mud."

02:28.679 --> 02:32.142
My apologies. Anwar is
a bit of a troublemaker.

02:32.182 --> 02:33.691
What kind of trouble is he making?

02:33.728 --> 02:36.599
Everyone in life wants more than they have.

02:36.700 --> 02:38.593
I'm Haroun Talif, the manager.

02:38.611 --> 02:40.536
You've met Kedar, our head of security?

02:40.637 --> 02:41.937
Sort of.

02:42.105 --> 02:43.962
And this is my son, Youssef.

02:49.602 --> 02:52.447
I imagine you're anxious
to take that off your wrist.

02:52.515 --> 02:53.615
This way.

02:55.818 --> 02:57.285
How was your trip?

02:57.405 --> 02:59.855
- Uneventful.
- Until the sand storm.

03:00.089 --> 03:01.590
The winds are quite high.

03:01.629 --> 03:04.291
You won't be able to drive
back until the evening.

03:12.869 --> 03:14.870
Is there a problem?

03:15.241 --> 03:18.172
We weren't told the contents of the case.

03:18.292 --> 03:20.341
I didn't expect it to be cash.

03:20.461 --> 03:22.622
There are many bandits in the area.

03:22.659 --> 03:24.552
A gold mine is an obvious target.

03:24.589 --> 03:27.863
Mr. Talif, you put us through
a lot of trouble to deliver...

03:27.881 --> 03:29.345
not a lot of money.

03:30.223 --> 03:32.401
You were well-paid, were you not?

03:32.521 --> 03:34.221
That's not the point.

03:37.626 --> 03:39.126
The shift change.

03:39.159 --> 03:40.794
Kedar will take you to your tent.

03:41.963 --> 03:43.632
Saved by the bell.

04:16.654 --> 04:18.894
Maybe he doesn't speak English.

04:19.433 --> 04:21.226
Maybe he's a wanker.

04:22.892 --> 04:24.996
_

04:30.602 --> 04:33.749
What were they arguing about?
Our host and that miner, Anwar?

04:33.869 --> 04:36.815
From what I could make
out, health and safety.

04:36.850 --> 04:39.301
The mine's refusing to make improvements.

04:39.676 --> 04:42.153
Profits don't go into the
local housing, obviously.

04:42.354 --> 04:44.478
I'm sure inside the mine's worse.

04:48.594 --> 04:51.136
_

04:57.045 --> 04:59.679
_

04:59.889 --> 05:02.267
_

05:02.578 --> 05:04.691
_

05:04.710 --> 05:06.767
What did they make us travel all this way?

05:06.804 --> 05:08.414
Something was in that case.

05:08.647 --> 05:10.921
- Something other than money.
- Like what?

05:18.985 --> 05:20.485
_

05:22.109 --> 05:23.602
_

06:37.522 --> 06:43.617
- synced and corrected by chamallow -
- www.addic7ed.com -

06:57.338 --> 06:59.744
Three men are dead and six
are trapped in the mine.

07:03.886 --> 07:04.647
What is it?

07:04.647 --> 07:07.420
He's saying why don't they send
a rescue team from El-AaiÃºn?

07:14.043 --> 07:15.982
The sandstorm makes it impossible.

07:16.037 --> 07:18.748
The men have only 12 hours of oxygen.

07:26.035 --> 07:28.252
He used to work in a mine up the mountain.

07:33.783 --> 07:36.520
He says that there's
still dynamite up there.

07:39.608 --> 07:41.437
He's saying that even if it's still there,

07:41.444 --> 07:43.039
it's been sitting for too long,

07:43.046 --> 07:45.598
and even a small bomb
could make it explode.

07:50.246 --> 07:53.120
Those are the names of the
miners stuck down there.

08:07.581 --> 08:08.986
"Youssef."

08:09.345 --> 08:10.750
Youssef...

08:10.957 --> 08:13.040
His son is down there too.

08:22.968 --> 08:25.381
How many off-road trucks do you have?

08:28.396 --> 08:29.559
Three.

08:29.779 --> 08:32.479
Then you need three drivers
to get that dynamite,

08:33.111 --> 08:34.946
to be sure at least one makes it back.

08:35.171 --> 08:37.448
You are a professional driver, Mr. Martin.

08:37.549 --> 08:39.802
And I'm giving you my professional advice.

08:39.922 --> 08:41.820
My only son is in there,

08:42.575 --> 08:44.405
and you are his only chance.

08:44.525 --> 08:45.634
Please.

08:53.832 --> 08:56.061
You still need two more drivers.

08:56.181 --> 08:57.393
Thank you...

08:57.883 --> 08:59.595
Thank you very much.

09:01.330 --> 09:02.288
Frank?

09:02.551 --> 09:03.605
He's right.

09:03.663 --> 09:05.258
I'm the best chance these men have got.

09:05.295 --> 09:07.307
- _
- That doesn't mean you have to do it.

09:07.307 --> 09:08.909
_

09:09.312 --> 09:11.192
And if I don't? And those men die?

09:11.237 --> 09:13.212
_

09:13.242 --> 09:14.873
_

09:15.217 --> 09:16.966
_

09:17.999 --> 09:19.352
_

09:21.935 --> 09:24.086
_

09:24.438 --> 09:27.225
_

09:28.110 --> 09:29.369
_

09:29.489 --> 09:30.737
_

09:31.073 --> 09:32.229
_

09:34.343 --> 09:35.733
_

09:41.258 --> 09:43.073
_

09:45.964 --> 09:47.274
That's three.

09:51.253 --> 09:52.914
At least let me go with you.

09:52.929 --> 09:54.795
I don't need a passenger, Cat.

09:55.080 --> 09:58.424
Besides, I need you to find
out what else was in that case.

09:59.280 --> 10:01.702
You think it had something
to do with the collapse?

10:02.022 --> 10:03.172
Don't you?

10:03.831 --> 10:05.499
We slipped it past customs...

10:05.525 --> 10:06.955
Never saw what we had.

10:06.977 --> 10:08.280
Why kill their own men?

10:08.880 --> 10:10.724
Well that miner, Anwar,

10:10.731 --> 10:13.051
who was arguing about
safety, he's down there.

10:13.300 --> 10:15.993
An accident is a tidy way
to solve a labour problem.

10:16.037 --> 10:18.590
Do you really think they
would collapse their own mine?

10:19.205 --> 10:20.792
Shit happens.

10:21.201 --> 10:23.126
And I expect it's a lot more cost-effective

10:23.140 --> 10:24.853
than meeting Anwar's demands.

10:25.153 --> 10:28.130
Clearly the manager didn't
expect his own son to be there.

10:28.313 --> 10:29.914
Clearly.

10:30.034 --> 10:32.228
But this only happened
because I took the job.

10:33.070 --> 10:34.919
You're not responsible, Frank.

10:34.943 --> 10:36.648
If that's why you're doing this.

10:37.489 --> 10:39.187
I don't like being lied to.

10:44.563 --> 10:46.027
You speak English?

10:46.364 --> 10:47.681
Yes, I do.

10:47.893 --> 10:49.437
I'm Caterina Boldieu.

10:49.557 --> 10:50.894
He's Frank Martin.

10:51.014 --> 10:53.242
My name is Nassima and this is Sulaiman.

10:53.362 --> 10:55.487
You know how to drive
one of these, Nassima?

10:55.511 --> 10:57.202
I used to drive a tractor.

10:57.919 --> 10:59.023
Close enough.

10:59.310 --> 11:00.567
You have radios?

11:01.855 --> 11:04.723
Channel 1 reaches us, if
mountains are not in the way.

11:04.843 --> 11:06.735
Channel 2 is to talk to each other.

11:06.757 --> 11:09.195
Cat has access to the radio at all times.

11:09.315 --> 11:11.375
You don't trust us, Mr. Martin?

11:12.685 --> 11:14.916
I don't trust you. And I don't like you.

11:17.624 --> 11:19.394
As you wish, Mr. Martin.

11:20.581 --> 11:22.783
Since Sulaiman knows where the mine is,

11:22.903 --> 11:24.166
he'll take the lead.

11:29.975 --> 11:32.126
He's established
communication with the miners.

11:32.184 --> 11:33.150
Youssef!

11:33.270 --> 11:34.687
_

11:35.243 --> 11:37.453
_

11:38.682 --> 11:40.709
_

11:42.268 --> 11:44.171
_

11:45.364 --> 11:46.790
_

11:46.995 --> 11:49.161
_

11:50.292 --> 11:51.766
My son is hurt.

11:52.366 --> 11:54.096
Then we'd better get going.

12:02.041 --> 12:03.639
Kedar speaks the Queen's English.

12:03.651 --> 12:05.321
I told you he was a wanker.

12:05.441 --> 12:06.929
You seem on edge.

12:07.049 --> 12:10.178
Driving explosives on an
unpaved road will do that to you.

12:10.298 --> 12:11.861
There's something else.

12:14.450 --> 12:15.812
I don't like driving slow.

12:15.932 --> 12:17.218
You what?

12:17.414 --> 12:20.054
I like driving fast,
obviously, but slow, I'm...

12:20.355 --> 12:21.790
I'm crap at it.

12:21.834 --> 12:24.240
You wouldn't do this if you
didn't think you'd make it.

12:24.540 --> 12:27.526
If I don't come back,
kill that guy, willya?

12:33.568 --> 12:34.968
Be careful up there.

12:35.648 --> 12:36.819
Yep.

13:36.952 --> 13:38.459
_

13:40.691 --> 13:41.715
_

13:42.177 --> 13:44.401
_

13:45.360 --> 13:48.455
_

13:49.581 --> 13:51.849
_

14:04.837 --> 14:08.225
_

14:09.088 --> 14:11.210
_

14:11.330 --> 14:13.954
_

14:14.796 --> 14:16.889
_

14:17.701 --> 14:19.120
_

14:27.146 --> 14:28.661
_

14:28.781 --> 14:31.200
_

14:31.320 --> 14:33.292
_

14:33.329 --> 14:35.173
_

14:35.293 --> 14:38.451
_

14:40.697 --> 14:43.763
_

14:44.077 --> 14:45.416
_

14:45.665 --> 14:47.530
_

15:06.619 --> 15:08.083
_

16:02.612 --> 16:03.958
What's this?

16:05.006 --> 16:06.495
A map of the mine.

16:06.615 --> 16:08.690
If Mr. Martin brings the
explosives back in time,

16:08.710 --> 16:10.745
we can place a charge here.

16:10.846 --> 16:12.913
There's some risk of
further collapse, but...

16:13.014 --> 16:14.806
it's our best chance of getting them out.

16:15.049 --> 16:16.599
Can I have a word?

16:21.406 --> 16:22.775
Of course.

16:31.519 --> 16:34.343
You brought us here under
false pretences, Mr. Talif.

16:35.793 --> 16:37.184
False pretences?

16:37.304 --> 16:39.287
I found the hidden compartment

16:39.583 --> 16:41.039
and the residue.

16:43.878 --> 16:45.159
Residue?

16:45.279 --> 16:46.913
The plastic explosives.

16:47.447 --> 16:49.215
You were ordered to kill those men,

16:49.316 --> 16:51.017
and make it look like an accident.

16:51.137 --> 16:53.886
You were paid to do a job.
Not to make accusations.

16:54.006 --> 16:57.056
Three men are dead. Six
others could still die.

16:57.157 --> 16:58.943
You think I don't want to rescue those men?

16:58.980 --> 17:01.093
I think you want to rescue your son.

17:01.213 --> 17:03.926
But even if Frank makes
it with those explosives...

17:05.718 --> 17:07.306
Is that what he wants?

17:15.141 --> 17:16.753
What are you asking from me?

17:16.874 --> 17:18.297
For your help.

17:18.609 --> 17:20.288
To make sure those men survive.

17:20.407 --> 17:21.847
And we do, too.

17:29.968 --> 17:31.168
Nassima?

17:31.410 --> 17:33.591
Ask Sulaiman how much further.

17:33.774 --> 17:35.017
Sulaiman?

17:39.569 --> 17:41.691
Not far now, Inshallah.

17:42.943 --> 17:43.882
Right.

17:46.371 --> 17:48.116
He wants to know why you're doing this.

17:48.236 --> 17:49.788
Fancied a mountain drive.

17:50.099 --> 17:51.416
What about him?

17:54.946 --> 17:57.151
When he was young, he
was trapped in a mine.

17:58.916 --> 18:00.961
A man risked his life to save his.

18:01.186 --> 18:03.034
He is repaying his debt to God.

18:04.216 --> 18:05.422
And you?

18:06.517 --> 18:08.437
One of the miners down there...

18:08.724 --> 18:10.064
He's called Anwar.

18:10.269 --> 18:12.095
Yeah, I saw him when I arrived.

18:12.805 --> 18:14.022
He's my husband.

18:49.609 --> 18:51.067
Where's the dynamite?

19:22.514 --> 19:23.585
No.

19:34.629 --> 19:36.385
He says it's sat too long.

20:09.668 --> 20:13.027
The nitroglycerine, it's seeped
to the bottom of the crate.

21:04.946 --> 21:07.007
- Is that good enough?
- It better be.

21:07.127 --> 21:08.284
C'mon.

21:20.022 --> 21:20.947
Thank you.

21:25.613 --> 21:27.041
How did you get that?

21:29.236 --> 21:30.575
It's a funny story.

21:31.261 --> 21:33.433
Funny "ha-ha", or funny odd?

21:34.151 --> 21:36.663
Anwar and I, we had a farm.

21:36.783 --> 21:37.751
Yeah...

21:37.938 --> 21:39.583
where you drove a tractor.

21:40.204 --> 21:42.247
Bandits steal our things.

21:42.403 --> 21:43.897
They burn our crops.

21:44.331 --> 21:45.975
We tried to fight back.

21:46.173 --> 21:48.434
Anwar got a rifle to scare them.

21:48.879 --> 21:51.210
And then one night, they
set the house on fire.

21:51.560 --> 21:52.678
It burnt,

21:52.798 --> 21:53.960
and I got this.

21:54.363 --> 21:56.282
So Anwar works at the mine?

21:56.687 --> 21:58.165
14 hours a day,

21:58.514 --> 21:59.667
seven days a week.

22:00.487 --> 22:02.834
Rotten food. Poison air.

22:03.676 --> 22:05.403
The men who own the mine,

22:06.181 --> 22:08.020
they don't steal your things,

22:08.833 --> 22:10.197
they steal your life.

22:12.433 --> 22:15.382
I saw your husband argue
with the manager, Talif.

22:15.502 --> 22:17.707
Anwar called a strike to start tomorrow.

22:18.504 --> 22:20.423
But now with the accident...

22:21.273 --> 22:23.339
That's a fairly nifty coincidence.

22:26.383 --> 22:28.063
I thought you were a bad man,

22:28.881 --> 22:30.703
until you said you would drive.

22:32.611 --> 22:34.608
You said this was a funny story.

22:36.803 --> 22:38.102
I like this scar.

22:40.987 --> 22:42.006
You know why?

22:44.312 --> 22:46.156
It tells me never be a victim.

22:47.232 --> 22:48.469
Fight...

22:48.808 --> 22:50.900
so my children have a better life.

23:02.212 --> 23:03.026
Youssef?

23:09.659 --> 23:10.689
Youssef?

23:12.738 --> 23:14.061
_

23:14.998 --> 23:17.644
_

23:18.750 --> 23:20.055
_

23:22.947 --> 23:24.276
_

23:24.317 --> 23:25.728
_

23:27.519 --> 23:29.281
_

23:30.786 --> 23:32.577
_

23:32.623 --> 23:34.479
_

23:35.234 --> 23:36.346
_

23:37.043 --> 23:40.550
_

23:40.620 --> 23:42.142
_

23:44.232 --> 23:45.455
_

23:53.657 --> 23:54.851
_

24:03.022 --> 24:04.567
_

24:04.631 --> 24:06.259
_

24:06.379 --> 24:08.015
_

24:09.367 --> 24:10.661
What's wrong with him?

24:11.890 --> 24:13.014
He's not well.

24:13.236 --> 24:14.980
Problems with his lungs.

24:15.244 --> 24:17.205
You said those men had 12 hours.

24:17.428 --> 24:18.739
That's right.

24:18.859 --> 24:21.578
And that man's struggling
to breathe after four?

24:24.112 --> 24:25.259
_

24:25.902 --> 24:26.974
_

24:51.513 --> 24:53.737
_

24:55.411 --> 24:57.038
_

24:59.139 --> 25:00.696
_

25:03.523 --> 25:04.893
_

25:06.386 --> 25:07.855
_

26:24.745 --> 26:26.127
Frank, you there?

26:28.761 --> 26:30.511
- I'm here.
- You okay?

26:32.560 --> 26:34.517
Swell. We've just loaded the trucks.

26:34.718 --> 26:36.072
How long 'til you get back?

26:36.311 --> 26:38.477
It took us two hours to drive up here,

26:38.489 --> 26:39.871
but this stuff is so unstable

26:39.893 --> 26:41.726
I'd say it'll take six to get back.

26:41.846 --> 26:43.793
That's not going to be soon enough.

26:43.913 --> 26:45.595
They said those men had 12 hours.

26:45.696 --> 26:47.077
That's what they said.

26:48.265 --> 26:49.570
How long have they got?

26:49.623 --> 26:51.642
I don't know. But one of the men just died.

26:51.713 --> 26:52.766
Mohammed.

26:53.504 --> 26:54.739
We have to go now.

26:56.401 --> 26:58.549
We're not gonna help your
husband by blowing ourselves up.

26:58.578 --> 27:01.294
We go as fast as we can, and no faster.

27:01.978 --> 27:03.056
We're on our way.

27:04.714 --> 27:06.492
You follow my path exactly.

27:06.612 --> 27:07.645
You understand?

27:12.135 --> 27:12.884
Good.

27:13.223 --> 27:14.412
Let's do this.

27:50.992 --> 27:52.263
Nassima...

27:53.461 --> 27:54.792
slow down,

27:55.933 --> 27:58.234
there's a bump on the left.

27:58.354 --> 28:01.231
You crawl over it, you
understand? You crawl.

28:01.518 --> 28:03.186
Understood.

28:45.778 --> 28:46.978
Sulaiman?

28:47.248 --> 28:48.506
_

29:37.362 --> 29:38.759
Is he alright?

29:38.952 --> 29:40.240
He's fine.

29:45.923 --> 29:48.304
Crankcase blew. This
thing's not going anywhere.

29:48.376 --> 29:49.974
You can roll it downhill.

29:50.015 --> 29:52.976
Where to? There's no shoulder
on this road for at least a mile.

29:53.077 --> 29:54.335
We need to get past.

29:54.344 --> 29:55.383
Come with me.

30:01.762 --> 30:03.530
What? What is it?

30:04.607 --> 30:08.283
He says it's God's will and
the men can't be rescued.

30:08.611 --> 30:11.069
You tell him God helps
those who help themselves.

30:11.303 --> 30:13.345
- Is that from the Bible?
- The Koran.

30:14.486 --> 30:16.054
What are you doing?

30:16.119 --> 30:17.957
You're both getting back in your trucks.

30:18.197 --> 30:19.854
- What for?
- You're gonna back them up.

30:19.906 --> 30:21.674
What good will that do?

30:21.733 --> 30:22.816
Just do it!

30:28.851 --> 30:30.203
_

30:31.842 --> 30:33.464
_

30:35.600 --> 30:37.187
_

30:37.227 --> 30:39.130
_

30:41.787 --> 30:43.965
- _
- _

30:46.394 --> 30:47.980
_

30:51.141 --> 30:52.586
_

30:59.470 --> 31:00.694
_

31:04.493 --> 31:05.863
_

31:07.210 --> 31:08.925
_

31:10.049 --> 31:13.069
_

31:14.673 --> 31:16.242
_

31:18.449 --> 31:20.111
_

31:25.555 --> 31:27.095
_

31:30.952 --> 31:32.755
_

31:33.950 --> 31:35.513
_

31:42.046 --> 31:43.383
She has found something.

31:43.484 --> 31:44.984
A way to help the men.

31:45.488 --> 31:46.433
A tunnel,

31:46.658 --> 31:48.578
adjacent to the collapse.

31:48.818 --> 31:51.291
If you breach the wall
here, even just a crack,

31:51.492 --> 31:53.103
you could get them more air.

31:55.725 --> 31:57.171
It's worth a try.

31:58.198 --> 31:59.932
She's not even an engineer.

32:00.683 --> 32:01.906
Does it matter?

32:03.546 --> 32:04.910
Now go do it!

32:07.544 --> 32:08.656
As you wish.

32:14.480 --> 32:15.995
Do you have any weapons?

32:16.471 --> 32:17.416
Why?

32:17.517 --> 32:19.984
You'll need them. We both will.

32:20.996 --> 32:22.747
Kedar has them all locked up.

32:22.794 --> 32:24.187
Can you get the key?

32:26.078 --> 32:27.032
I might.

32:27.237 --> 32:28.344
Then get it.

32:37.059 --> 32:38.308
_

32:38.536 --> 32:40.491
_

32:40.702 --> 32:44.161
- _
- _

33:00.314 --> 33:01.286
Wait here.

33:01.327 --> 33:02.784
What are you going to do?

33:02.966 --> 33:04.242
God's will.

34:19.936 --> 34:21.875
Can we go now?

34:25.112 --> 34:27.326
Cat?

34:28.409 --> 34:30.225
How's it going?

34:30.344 --> 34:32.159
We hit a little bump in the road.

34:32.192 --> 34:33.895
How little?

34:34.014 --> 34:35.464
We're down to two trucks.

34:35.583 --> 34:37.130
Nassima and Sulaiman?

34:37.167 --> 34:39.299
Fine. We're all fine.

34:39.418 --> 34:42.089
Your pal, Kedar, he
won't be happy about that.

34:42.123 --> 34:43.725
What's he gonna do about it?

34:43.762 --> 34:45.683
That's the question, isn't it?

34:47.362 --> 34:49.429
- Be careful, Frank.
- Yeah. You too.

34:51.399 --> 34:52.808
They are OK?

34:52.928 --> 34:55.241
They're down to two trucks.

34:56.704 --> 34:58.030
What is it?

35:02.042 --> 35:03.335
Where'd you get the key?

35:03.372 --> 35:05.064
I stole it from Kedar's tent.

35:05.184 --> 35:07.616
I'm to return it before he notices.

35:11.284 --> 35:12.857
Too late.

35:18.425 --> 35:20.063
Where are the guns?

35:20.298 --> 35:21.432
I moved them.

35:21.766 --> 35:23.467
For safekeeping.

35:23.923 --> 35:25.752
I am the manager of this mine.

35:25.788 --> 35:27.444
And I'm the head of security.

35:29.541 --> 35:31.313
My key please.

35:48.559 --> 35:50.293
What can we do?

35:50.413 --> 35:53.099
He still has to make this
look like an accident,

35:53.219 --> 35:55.934
like there's no way to rescue those people.

35:56.054 --> 35:57.636
There won't be if your
friend doesn't return

35:57.654 --> 35:59.101
with that dynamite.

35:59.221 --> 36:01.624
Well then, we just have
to make sure he does.

36:12.206 --> 36:14.849
I think you are a good
man, but a strange man.

36:16.056 --> 36:18.435
Thank you... I think.

36:20.401 --> 36:23.456
I think you like it, the danger.

36:25.528 --> 36:27.526
Most of us want to live

36:27.563 --> 36:29.301
a long time.

36:29.899 --> 36:31.871
I intend to live long enough.

36:32.134 --> 36:35.280
You have no wife? No children?

36:35.508 --> 36:36.752
No.

36:36.872 --> 36:38.721
Those things give life meaning.

36:38.841 --> 36:40.659
I'm glad you think so.

36:41.650 --> 36:44.478
I hope you live long
enough to find I'm right.

36:44.713 --> 36:47.056
Listen, Nassima...

36:47.466 --> 36:50.444
You should know I was hired
to drive a case from Madrid.

36:50.466 --> 36:52.281
They wanted me to think it was cash,

36:52.317 --> 36:53.576
but I think it was something they used

36:53.605 --> 36:54.812
to trigger the accident,

36:54.932 --> 36:56.326
the collapse.

36:56.446 --> 36:58.316
To make it look like an accident.

36:58.829 --> 37:00.884
Then this happened because of you?

37:03.936 --> 37:06.350
That's why you're here, driving this truck?

37:07.602 --> 37:09.759
It seemed like a good idea at the time.

37:13.174 --> 37:15.217
Now I'm not so sure.

37:18.444 --> 37:20.500
They don't look too friendly, do they?

37:40.637 --> 37:42.224
What do they want?

37:44.238 --> 37:48.042
Gold, they say they
know we're from the mine.

37:55.749 --> 37:57.225
Tell them to be careful.

38:00.986 --> 38:02.164
Or not.

38:12.331 --> 38:13.835
I'll show him the gold.

38:15.160 --> 38:16.726
Tell him, tell him!

38:19.002 --> 38:20.875
Say I'll climb inside the truck,

38:20.912 --> 38:22.273
tell him it's hidden under the sand.

38:29.634 --> 38:31.264
No, no, stop!

38:33.015 --> 38:35.801
He says he'll get it. He wants
you to tell him where it is.

38:36.169 --> 38:37.873
When I say run, you run...

38:37.925 --> 38:38.971
- OK?
- OK.

38:45.431 --> 38:46.873
Tell him it's by the cab,

38:46.902 --> 38:48.380
he has to dig under the sand to find it.

39:01.990 --> 39:03.058
Run!

40:10.736 --> 40:12.060
_

40:12.375 --> 40:14.841
_

40:15.317 --> 40:19.026
_

40:22.743 --> 40:24.433
_

40:26.350 --> 40:27.945
_

40:35.152 --> 40:36.711
_

40:38.386 --> 40:39.908
_

40:40.215 --> 40:41.628
_

40:43.377 --> 40:44.994
_

40:46.699 --> 40:48.052
_

40:49.222 --> 40:50.795
_

40:51.315 --> 40:53.093
_

40:54.095 --> 40:55.646
_

40:57.403 --> 41:01.231
_

41:02.431 --> 41:04.150
_

41:25.618 --> 41:26.799
Cat?

41:26.919 --> 41:28.573
Here.

41:28.617 --> 41:30.768
We're getting close.
Have them open the gate.

41:30.922 --> 41:32.561
We'll do that.

41:33.293 --> 41:35.274
You hear that, Kedar?

41:35.994 --> 41:37.295
Right away.

41:42.338 --> 41:44.853
- We need guns.
- He took them.

41:44.973 --> 41:47.203
He didn't take all of them.

42:06.805 --> 42:08.451
_

42:36.234 --> 42:37.587
_

42:37.975 --> 42:40.141
_

42:44.635 --> 42:46.910
- _
- Not him...

42:47.596 --> 42:48.746
Me.

42:52.768 --> 42:54.322
On your feet!

43:35.744 --> 43:37.799
Tell him he's going to
need a pulley to move it.

43:38.045 --> 43:39.452
We are ready.

43:44.086 --> 43:45.475
Where's laughing boy?

43:45.519 --> 43:46.689
Not laughing anymore.

43:46.923 --> 43:48.351
You killed him?

43:48.826 --> 43:50.099
He did.

43:54.997 --> 43:56.497
What about the men?

43:56.617 --> 43:59.026
We haven't been able to
reach them for an hour.

46:08.593 --> 46:10.627
There will be justice for my son.

46:10.747 --> 46:13.219
I will make sure there is justice.

47:00.672 --> 47:02.201
You okay?

47:03.480 --> 47:05.435
Let's get the hell out of here.
