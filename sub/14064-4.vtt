WEBVTT

00:01.126 --> 00:03.438
Hey, listen, I think you remember reverend Diddum.

00:03.473 --> 00:05.750
Well, it turns out the reverend is also a lawyer.

00:05.785 --> 00:08.234
I've decided to let him handle my divorce.

00:08.269 --> 00:09.112
Instead of targeting the

00:09.147 --> 00:10.876
ex-husband, we go after the reverend.

00:10.911 --> 00:11.588
The reverend?

00:11.623 --> 00:13.341
Three sexual harassment complaints

00:13.376 --> 00:15.060
The man has a certain weakness.

00:16.594 --> 00:18.627
Did you commit this act

00:18.662 --> 00:23.309
because he was evil or because you are?

00:23.344 --> 00:25.266
Because he was.

00:27.730 --> 00:29.571
I want Alan Shore.

00:36.870 --> 00:37.813
I'd like to know how a United

00:37.848 --> 00:39.617
States congressman could be held liable

00:39.652 --> 00:41.454
for an official act of congressional

00:41.489 --> 00:43.221
business for which he enjoys immunity?

00:43.256 --> 00:45.201
You can be held liable because you've been sued

00:45.236 --> 00:46.976
under traditional state tort law

00:47.011 --> 00:48.716
for which you enjoy no immunity.

00:50.642 --> 00:51.765
I want Denny Crane.

00:53.136 --> 00:55.951
Uh, you don't want Denny Crane.

00:55.986 --> 00:58.767
Denise is one of our top…

00:58.850 --> 01:01.218
I'm entitled to the top.

01:01.478 --> 01:03.910
Is there a reason I'm not getting Denny?

01:05.982 --> 01:07.484
Denny…

01:08.109 --> 01:09.652
Denny has, uh…

01:09.694 --> 01:10.761
Mad cow disease.

01:11.779 --> 01:13.364
I just saw him on television

01:13.448 --> 01:14.949
in Kelly Nolan's murder trial.

01:14.991 --> 01:17.243
He was at the defense table for effect, Raymond.

01:17.285 --> 01:20.395
He's not capable of any complex litigation.

01:24.751 --> 01:27.179
I knew you were there, Denny.

01:27.337 --> 01:28.796
Did you?

01:28.838 --> 01:30.965
Raymond Jacobs.

01:31.007 --> 01:34.260
You handled my first divorce 15 years ago.

01:34.594 --> 01:36.471
–My wife's name was Lois?
–I remember.

01:36.512 --> 01:38.389
Why wouldn't you? You slept with her.

01:38.431 --> 01:40.349
Only after the divorce was final.

01:40.430 --> 01:43.144
May I ask, Denny, how do you feel about gun control?

01:43.186 --> 01:44.152
For communists.

01:44.187 --> 01:45.229
What about banning assault

01:45.313 --> 01:46.673
weapons in the private sector?

01:46.708 --> 01:48.339
As soon as you say it's okay to

01:48.374 --> 01:49.670
ban assault weapons, my friend,

01:49.705 --> 01:50.932
even in the private sector,

01:50.967 --> 01:52.853
you make it easier to take guns away from hunting,

01:52.888 --> 01:54.312
then personal protection.

01:54.347 --> 01:55.649
Soon the military and the

01:55.684 --> 01:56.951
police are without firearms.

01:57.723 --> 02:00.243
By banning assault weapons in the private sector,

02:00.278 --> 02:02.763
the military and the police would lose their guns?

02:02.798 --> 02:04.067
And their dominoes.

02:04.350 --> 02:05.777
It's a whole theory.

02:07.209 --> 02:10.136
She's a Liberal. Can't even hunt.

02:23.559 --> 02:24.271
You set?

02:25.150 --> 02:26.269
Set?

02:26.304 --> 02:27.899
You sure you don't need a second chair?

02:27.934 --> 02:28.689
This is a murder trial.

02:28.772 --> 02:33.319
I want Catherine to be the underdog.

02:33.354 --> 02:33.611
An army of lawyers would subvert that.

02:34.069 --> 02:35.613
You okay?

02:36.071 --> 02:37.902
Tara quit.

02:38.365 --> 02:40.451
What do you mean, she quit?

02:40.618 --> 02:42.328
She's gone.

02:42.369 --> 02:45.581
–She quit the firm?
–She quit me, actually.

02:45.622 --> 02:48.629
But she's left the firm as well.

02:53.255 --> 02:55.036
Alan, do you have the

02:55.071 --> 02:58.130
necessary focus to try this case?

03:01.263 --> 03:02.723
I do.

03:46.966 --> 03:47.978
Coroner's report showed he'd

03:48.013 --> 03:50.353
been struck twice behind the head,

03:50.395 --> 03:52.355
the second blow being fatal.

03:52.397 --> 03:55.170
And was there any sign of a struggle, detective?

03:55.400 --> 03:56.484
No.

03:56.602 --> 03:58.676
Any evidence to suggest that

03:58.711 --> 03:59.904
the victim had made any

03:59.988 --> 04:01.823
threatening movement toward the defendant?

04:01.990 --> 04:02.422
No.

04:02.457 --> 04:03.471
And in the statement

04:03.506 --> 04:04.682
made to you by the defendant,

04:04.717 --> 04:07.412
did she say the victim was threatening her?

04:07.495 --> 04:10.227
She did not say that she was in any imminent danger

04:10.262 --> 04:11.658
at the time she hit him.

04:12.059 --> 04:13.493
Thank you, sir.

04:14.335 --> 04:15.796
Your witness.

04:15.837 --> 04:17.159
I have nothing.

04:17.255 --> 04:19.357
It appears your exhaustive testimony

04:19.392 --> 04:21.740
covered everything. You left nothing out.

04:22.468 --> 04:24.971
Is that correct, detective?

04:25.013 --> 04:27.223
Pretty much.

04:27.724 --> 04:28.941
Thank you, detective, for

04:28.976 --> 04:30.777
your fine commitment to detail.

04:38.276 --> 04:40.111
Okay. The witness may step down.

04:40.153 --> 04:43.489
Actually, one thing you pretty much left out.

04:43.531 --> 04:45.116
No harm. We can cover it now.

04:45.158 --> 04:48.744
Mr Ferrion had previously killed two people.

04:48.786 --> 04:52.331
He whacked both his mother and a neighbor?

04:52.373 --> 04:54.792
–Allegedly.
–Allegedly.

04:55.209 --> 04:57.295
Isn't it pretty much the opinion

04:57.378 --> 04:59.380
of the Boston police department

04:59.422 --> 05:01.883
that he committed these murders?

05:01.924 --> 05:02.765
Yes.

05:02.800 --> 05:03.535
Thank you.

05:03.593 --> 05:05.845
I'm sure you pretty much meant to

05:05.928 --> 05:08.097
include that in your testimony but…

05:08.132 --> 05:09.379
forgot.

05:13.936 --> 05:17.356
Mrs. Piper came to you a week before

05:17.398 --> 05:20.776
Mr Ferrion was killed, didn't she?

05:20.818 --> 05:21.784
She did.

05:21.819 --> 05:23.737
She told you she feared

05:23.779 --> 05:25.656
Mr Ferrion would kill again.

05:25.698 --> 05:26.537
Yes.

05:26.572 --> 05:28.360
Relayed to you Bernard's

05:28.395 --> 05:30.202
comments about how the next time,

05:30.244 --> 05:32.288
he'd be sure to leave little

05:32.371 --> 05:34.331
clues like the B.T.K. killer.

05:34.373 --> 05:36.834
She tell you that, detective?

05:36.917 --> 05:37.369
Yes

05:37.404 --> 05:39.643
And after she told you all this,

05:40.245 --> 05:41.476
you did what, detective?

05:41.511 --> 05:43.683
I told her there wasn't enough to make an arrest.

05:43.718 --> 05:45.257
You sent her away.

05:46.969 --> 05:48.429
Tell me, detective,

05:48.470 --> 05:50.556
have you considered if you'd

05:50.639 --> 05:52.641
heeded Catherine Piper's warnings,

05:52.683 --> 05:54.560
Bernard Ferrion might still be alive?

05:54.601 --> 05:55.381
Objection!

05:55.416 --> 05:56.162
Withdrawn.

05:56.729 --> 06:00.149
Moving forward a bit, Bernard Ferrion's demise.

06:00.190 --> 06:01.900
So you found him dead,

06:01.942 --> 06:04.118
conducted Sherlock Holmesian

06:04.153 --> 06:07.406
investigation, which led, at last,

06:07.447 --> 06:09.783
to Catherine Piper's doorstep?

06:09.825 --> 06:11.243
No.

06:11.285 --> 06:14.121
–She came to us.
–Oh, she came to you!

06:14.162 --> 06:15.163
Yes.

06:15.247 --> 06:17.106
Well, you certainly left that out, didn't you?

06:17.141 --> 06:18.813
She didn't come forth for a full week.

06:18.848 --> 06:20.502
Maybe Catherine hesitated

06:20.537 --> 06:22.705
because she feared being arrested.

06:22.740 --> 06:24.838
Yet her conscience and sense of

06:24.873 --> 06:26.807
morality eventually overcame her fear,

06:26.842 --> 06:28.742
which, of course, the jury would know

06:28.777 --> 06:29.856
if you'd lived up to your

06:29.891 --> 06:30.772
oath to tell the whole truth.

06:30.807 --> 06:31.654
–Objection!
–Mr Shore!

06:31.689 --> 06:34.666
What? What did I say?

06:38.728 --> 06:42.023
I paid $2,000 to his campaign personally,

06:42.065 --> 06:44.151
and I contributed another $2

06:44.234 --> 06:46.278
million to the Democratic national party

06:46.319 --> 06:47.654
on the assumption

06:47.696 --> 06:49.504
that this congressman, if

06:49.539 --> 06:52.909
reelected, would support gun control.

06:52.993 --> 06:55.120
Well, certainly, Mr Naughton, you realize that

06:55.161 --> 06:58.290
you cannot buy votes on Capital Hill.

06:58.331 --> 06:59.833
Oh, please.

06:59.874 --> 07:01.413
There was never any quid

07:01.448 --> 07:03.294
pro quo on any specific vote.

07:03.336 --> 07:04.963
But, sir, in your complaint,

07:05.005 --> 07:06.798
you cite his failure to

07:06.881 --> 07:08.591
support the ban on assault weapons.

07:08.626 --> 07:10.301
The fraud was perpetrated on me

07:10.385 --> 07:12.060
during his reelection campaign.

07:12.095 --> 07:14.222
The two of us got together for dinner.

07:14.264 --> 07:16.141
We shook hands. He looked me in the eye,

07:16.182 --> 07:17.976
and he told me that he would champion,

07:18.017 --> 07:20.270
not support, but champion the

07:20.353 --> 07:22.564
renewal of the ban against assault weapons.

07:22.605 --> 07:23.757
Then he goes off to

07:23.792 --> 07:26.609
Washington, and the ban just lapses.

07:26.651 --> 07:28.528
Doesn't even get brought up for a vote.

07:28.570 --> 07:31.698
And, sir, the fact that this ban was not renewed,

07:31.739 --> 07:35.201
how has it hurt you personally?

07:35.827 --> 07:37.537
On January 2nd,

07:37.578 --> 07:41.666
my nephew was buying milk in a convenience store.

07:41.708 --> 07:45.795
Two men came in to rob the store bearing AK-47s.

07:45.830 --> 07:47.964
Gunfire ensued.

07:48.005 --> 07:50.425
My nephew was killed.

07:51.843 --> 07:55.721
I am very sorry for your loss, sir.

07:55.763 --> 07:57.014
Are you suggesting that

07:57.056 --> 07:59.225
because you contributed money to this

07:59.308 --> 08:01.435
congressman that you bought his vote?

08:01.477 --> 08:04.188
There was no vote.

08:04.397 --> 08:06.357
Instead, congress just let the ban

08:06.440 --> 08:08.317
lapse without so much as a discussion.

08:08.352 --> 08:10.336
Didn't it lapse in part because

08:10.371 --> 08:12.321
the legislators in favor of the ban

08:12.405 --> 08:14.407
realized the votes just weren't there?

08:14.448 --> 08:16.867
When you secure a contribution based on a

08:16.951 --> 08:19.286
policy you have no intention of honoring,

08:19.321 --> 08:20.753
that's flat-out fraud.

08:20.788 --> 08:22.790
My point is, congressman Jacobs

08:22.873 --> 08:24.750
couldn't have gotten the ban renewed.

08:24.792 --> 08:27.128
Tom Delay had dismissed it as simply

08:27.169 --> 08:29.338
“a piece of feel-good legislation

08:29.380 --> 08:31.465
that had no chance of passing”.

08:31.549 --> 08:34.092
I didn't get a commitment from Tom Delay.

08:34.135 --> 08:36.886
I did from him.

08:45.312 --> 08:46.397
Oh, my God!

08:46.438 --> 08:47.446
Not quite.

08:47.481 --> 08:49.441
What are you doing here?

08:50.067 --> 08:53.404
Your behavior saddened me, Sara.

08:53.445 --> 08:56.740
–It left me bereft.
–Bereft?

08:56.991 --> 08:59.514
Let's not get carried away, reverend.

08:59.549 --> 09:02.037
–You desecrated my collar.
–How?

09:02.287 --> 09:04.380
You smelled it in a sexual manner.

09:04.415 --> 09:08.001
You rubbed it lasciviously against your face.

09:08.043 --> 09:09.545
I'm reporting you.

09:09.586 --> 09:13.340
–To whom?
–Your superiors, perhaps the bar.

09:13.375 --> 09:14.675
And what happens to you if

09:14.758 --> 09:16.009
your behavior becomes public?

09:16.051 --> 09:19.644
I've considered that. I must atone as well.

09:19.679 --> 09:23.237
We must both go public with our sins and atone.

09:24.559 --> 09:26.270
Reverend?

09:26.436 --> 09:29.398
I'm sorry.

09:29.606 --> 09:31.775
I was only trying to help a client

09:31.858 --> 09:33.902
I felt was being taken advantage of.

09:33.944 --> 09:37.864
I'm really sorry.

09:37.906 --> 09:42.077
I'd really appreciate you not…

09:42.327 --> 09:44.788
telling.

09:49.209 --> 09:51.503
On one condition.

09:52.587 --> 09:55.257
Go into the women's room,

09:55.298 --> 09:59.135
remove your panties and give them to me.

09:59.302 --> 10:00.268
I beg your pardon?

10:00.303 --> 10:02.639
You sniffed my personals. I

10:02.722 --> 10:04.975
should like a whiff of yours.

10:05.010 --> 10:06.017
First of all,

10:06.059 --> 10:08.812
I smelled your collar, not your shorts.

10:08.853 --> 10:10.959
Give me your underwear,

10:10.994 --> 10:13.066
or I'm going to atone.

10:15.693 --> 10:18.405
I first met him as a recovering murderer.

10:18.446 --> 10:20.385
He'd killed his mother and neighbor.

10:20.420 --> 10:22.325
Had he admitted these crimes to you?

10:22.367 --> 10:24.702
Oh, yes. Many times.

10:24.869 --> 10:26.913
Catherine, may I ask,

10:26.955 --> 10:30.124
why would you seek to befriend this man?

10:30.166 --> 10:33.294
Well, I felt at his core, he wasn't evil.

10:33.336 --> 10:35.630
I also thought I could help him

10:35.672 --> 10:38.591
by introducing him to Jesus Christ, our savior.

10:38.633 --> 10:41.594
–Was he open to that?
–Not terribly.

10:41.636 --> 10:45.348
He thought it would make him look like a bad Jew.

10:46.391 --> 10:49.185
So what happened?

10:49.227 --> 10:51.854
Well, we were in the kitchen

10:51.896 --> 10:55.817
watching the telecast about the Kelly Nolan trial.

10:55.858 --> 10:59.779
He was talking about leaving hints the next time…

11:00.113 --> 11:04.242
saying how he enjoyed the taste of killing.

11:04.283 --> 11:06.619
My mind started swirling.

11:06.661 --> 11:07.870
I was thinking,

11:07.912 --> 11:09.580
“I'd gone to the police.

11:09.664 --> 11:11.249
They said they couldn't help. ”

11:11.290 --> 11:13.501
There was no place for me to turn.

11:13.536 --> 11:16.170
If I ran away, that was a

11:16.254 --> 11:18.798
betrayal he said he couldn't tolerate.

11:20.007 --> 11:22.760
I looked down at my hands,

11:22.802 --> 11:25.429
saw I was holding the skillet,

11:25.471 --> 11:28.307
the weapon he'd used to commit murder.

11:28.349 --> 11:30.413
And I suddenly thought

11:30.448 --> 11:32.478
this was my only way out.

11:32.520 --> 11:34.522
So I just swung.

11:34.557 --> 11:36.273
Twice.

11:36.732 --> 11:38.818
And he dropped.

11:39.568 --> 11:43.280
Catherine, you took a human life.

11:43.906 --> 11:46.534
Killing his mother was strike one.

11:46.575 --> 11:49.161
Killing his neighbor was strike two.

11:49.203 --> 11:51.205
And the way he talked,

11:51.247 --> 11:54.458
Bernie had a third strike coming.

12:01.548 --> 12:03.467
I heard about Tara.

12:03.509 --> 12:05.344
I feel your hurt.

12:05.386 --> 12:08.305
What's most upsetting, Denny, is I don't hurt.

12:08.340 --> 12:10.516
So I don't have to hug you and tell

12:10.599 --> 12:12.726
you I'm there for you and all that crap?

12:13.977 --> 12:16.271
You can skip it.

12:16.313 --> 12:18.232
How's your trial going?

12:20.275 --> 12:22.528
I'm there as a prop.

12:22.569 --> 12:24.488
Shirley not giving you enough to do?

12:24.530 --> 12:27.658
Oh, Alan, it's a dream case.

12:27.866 --> 12:30.160
To be able to actually defend a

12:30.244 --> 12:32.454
congressman who opposes the ban on assault weapons?

12:32.496 --> 12:35.707
It's what any lawyer lives for.

12:40.379 --> 12:43.548
I'm gonna show you something.

12:55.393 --> 12:57.103
Jeez, Denny.

12:58.396 --> 13:00.669
Ooh. This one, my father gave me.

13:00.704 --> 13:02.943
Lovely. Could you kindly point it

13:03.026 --> 13:04.694
in any direction other than my head?

13:04.729 --> 13:05.820
It's not loaded.

13:05.987 --> 13:07.280
Oh! I guess it is.

13:07.322 --> 13:08.907
For God's sake, Denny!

13:08.949 --> 13:10.533
Oh, lighten up, will you?

13:11.743 --> 13:13.620
What in God's name?

13:13.662 --> 13:16.539
And it is in god's name, Shirley.

13:16.748 --> 13:18.708
The right to bear arms, second commandment.

13:18.750 --> 13:20.668
That would be the second amendment.

13:20.752 --> 13:22.003
That's same difference.

13:22.087 --> 13:23.797
I should be first-chairing this case.

13:23.838 --> 13:25.423
If anybody should be the poster

13:25.507 --> 13:27.008
boy for guns in this country…

13:27.092 --> 13:29.511
It should be you.

13:29.594 --> 13:32.013
Denny, congressman Jacobs is

13:32.096 --> 13:34.390
for the assault weapon ban.

13:34.474 --> 13:35.934
Did you know that?

13:36.017 --> 13:37.852
What do you mean, he's for the, the ban?

13:37.894 --> 13:40.855
He let it lapse because sometimes

13:40.939 --> 13:43.816
in politics, there are politics.

13:43.900 --> 13:46.819
But in principle, he's for the ban.

13:46.903 --> 13:49.426
But if he supports a law and

13:49.461 --> 13:51.949
then agrees to let it lapse,

13:52.033 --> 13:54.369
then that would make him…

13:54.452 --> 13:56.007
A Democrat.

13:57.163 --> 14:01.226
You're giving representation to a Democrat.

14:29.195 --> 14:30.996
With all the rain, the Charles

14:31.031 --> 14:33.009
has spilled into the sewer systems.

14:34.283 --> 14:36.410
It isn't exactly Nimmo bay.

14:36.452 --> 14:39.955
Word is they're catching some on commonwealth.

14:42.208 --> 14:44.960
I think I'm gonna retire, Alan.

14:53.135 --> 14:54.929
What's going on?

14:56.430 --> 14:57.723
I don't know. I just…

14:57.765 --> 15:00.330
I think it's a sign when the practice

15:00.365 --> 15:02.895
of law is less rewarding than, uh…

15:02.930 --> 15:05.481
Fishing in the sewer?

15:09.610 --> 15:12.112
I feel devalued.

15:12.404 --> 15:15.071
I always wanted to go out with my pride,

15:15.106 --> 15:17.739
failing that, at least my old time slot.

15:19.244 --> 15:21.371
I wish…

15:23.165 --> 15:25.501
I was never great.

15:27.085 --> 15:28.837
Because?

15:30.005 --> 15:32.216
Because…

15:33.592 --> 15:36.053
I remember.

15:37.763 --> 15:39.730
When God strips you of your talent,

15:39.765 --> 15:42.726
he should at least have the decency to strip away

15:42.768 --> 15:46.063
the memory of having had it.

15:56.114 --> 15:57.720
What do you mean, he wants your underwear?

15:57.755 --> 16:01.390
I mean he wants my underwear!

16:01.870 --> 16:03.288
–Is he still here?
–No.

16:03.371 --> 16:05.595
He asked me to think on it, pray on it,

16:05.630 --> 16:07.792
and he'll be back in the morning.

16:09.377 --> 16:11.212
Okay.

16:11.379 --> 16:13.340
Relax.

16:20.555 --> 16:21.880
Okay.

16:24.642 --> 16:26.394
You've got to give him your underwear.

16:26.436 --> 16:28.146
–What?
–Otherwise we'll be fired.

16:28.188 --> 16:30.273
I'm not gonna give him my underwear. Are you crazy?

16:30.315 --> 16:31.858
The guy is obviously sick.

16:31.900 --> 16:34.068
Which is why we need to be afraid here.

16:34.110 --> 16:35.541
If we can't count on him to be

16:35.576 --> 16:37.614
rational enough to save his own career?

16:37.649 --> 16:39.032
Just give him your underwear.

16:39.115 --> 16:40.783
That's not even an option, Garrett.

16:40.867 --> 16:42.493
First, because I would never do it,

16:42.535 --> 16:43.661
Sara, what if he reports us?

16:43.745 --> 16:45.288
And second, I'm not wearing any.

16:45.323 --> 16:46.927
We'll be fired and…

16:50.919 --> 16:52.211
You're not wearing any?

16:52.253 --> 16:55.173
Garrett! This is your doing!

16:55.214 --> 16:58.009
I'm making it your problem.

16:58.051 --> 17:00.803
You go deal with the sicko.

17:19.238 --> 17:20.323
The skillet was in your

17:20.406 --> 17:21.618
hand. Could you hold it, please?

17:21.654 --> 17:22.144
Objection.

17:22.179 --> 17:25.954
I would like her to demonstrate how she struck Mr Ferrion.

17:26.871 --> 17:29.248
Your honor, this is meant to inflame the jury.

17:29.332 --> 17:30.458
–There is simply no reason…
–She already described it.

17:30.512 --> 17:32.378
The prejudicial value of a demonstration,

17:32.413 --> 17:34.910
In a case like this… the prosecution's petrified.

17:34.945 --> 17:36.532
that my client comes off as sympathetic.

17:36.567 --> 17:37.734
She wants her to re-enact the

17:37.769 --> 17:38.973
crime to negate that sympathy.

17:39.008 --> 17:40.387
There's no probative value.

17:40.422 --> 17:41.766
It's a stunt, and a cheap one.

17:41.863 --> 17:43.748
–I'm going to allow it.
–What?

17:43.783 --> 17:45.734
The jury can see how it happened.

17:45.769 --> 17:47.686
She testified as to how it happened.

17:47.721 --> 17:50.237
I've made my ruling. Step back.

17:53.138 --> 17:55.013
Step back, counsel.

18:01.363 --> 18:04.027
Would you show us your movements, Mrs. Piper?

18:05.951 --> 18:07.202
I…

18:22.634 --> 18:27.514
I, I was at the sink facing this way.

18:27.973 --> 18:30.934
And he was going on about the taste of killing.

18:30.976 --> 18:34.897
That's when my mind started to swirl at the thought,

18:34.938 --> 18:38.859
“Oh, my God, he'll kill again. He might kill me!”

18:40.944 --> 18:43.113
I looked at the skillet,

18:43.155 --> 18:47.701
and suddenly, this could be my way out.

18:47.743 --> 18:49.911
And I wheeled…

19:01.423 --> 19:04.342
–A plea?
–Did you have to hit it so hard?

19:04.384 --> 19:07.179
I was under oath.

19:11.391 --> 19:13.935
I don't like the sound of that.

19:17.480 --> 19:19.816
Catherine, I'm not sure I can win this.

19:19.858 --> 19:22.152
–You promised.
–I promised I'd try.

19:22.193 --> 19:24.404
Well, that's all I'm asking for.

19:24.446 --> 19:27.157
I mean, just keep trying.

19:27.198 --> 19:29.200
Please.

19:32.162 --> 19:34.289
She really left?

19:35.331 --> 19:36.297
I'm sorry?

19:36.332 --> 19:39.794
Tara. She's gone?

19:41.629 --> 19:43.756
Evidently.

19:45.466 --> 19:48.011
I'm sorry.

19:48.219 --> 19:50.763
Not to worry.

19:57.854 --> 19:59.272
Look, if I had the power

19:59.355 --> 20:00.773
to move the bill for a vote,

20:00.808 --> 20:02.191
I would have.

20:02.233 --> 20:04.485
In fairness, did you try

20:04.569 --> 20:06.696
to move the bill for a vote?

20:06.731 --> 20:09.574
–No.
–Okay. Why not?

20:09.615 --> 20:12.034
Quite honestly, because I was up for reelection.

20:12.076 --> 20:13.619
If I'd been active about

20:13.661 --> 20:15.329
renewing the ban on assault weapons,

20:15.371 --> 20:16.831
the N.R.A. would have opposed

20:16.914 --> 20:18.541
me, run smear campaigns against me,

20:18.583 --> 20:22.086
and I'd be sitting here today as an ex-congressman.

20:22.170 --> 20:23.379
You caved.

20:23.462 --> 20:26.883
I cannot serve my constituents if I'm not in office.

20:26.966 --> 20:30.469
So like any elected official, I have to pick my battles.

20:30.511 --> 20:34.557
And political survival has to be a consideration.

20:34.640 --> 20:36.892
You told my client you'd support the ban.

20:36.976 --> 20:38.535
At the time, I fully planned to.

20:38.570 --> 20:40.252
Then in September,

20:40.287 --> 20:43.365
three lobbyists from the N.R.A. walked in my office,

20:43.400 --> 20:45.158
informed me they'd contribute

20:45.193 --> 20:46.782
heavily to my opponent's campaign,

20:46.817 --> 20:49.476
informed me they'd finance negative ADs against me.

20:49.511 --> 20:52.306
My advisors told me they'd be successful.

20:52.974 --> 20:54.794
So I would have lost my seat

20:54.829 --> 20:56.998
supporting a bill that had no chance of passing.

20:57.033 --> 20:58.651
Does that seem practical to you?

20:58.686 --> 21:00.235
Sticking to one's principles

21:00.270 --> 21:03.702
always struck me as being practical.

21:03.737 --> 21:07.134
Look, the ban on assault weapons…

21:09.049 --> 21:10.759
The Democrats are for it.

21:10.843 --> 21:12.469
The Republicans are for it.

21:12.511 --> 21:15.889
The police are for it. 80% of the public is for it.

21:15.931 --> 21:18.142
And we don't have it.

21:18.183 --> 21:21.812
That should tell you how powerful the gun lobby is.

21:21.854 --> 21:24.940
So you ran scared.

21:32.281 --> 21:33.949
That was horrible testimony!

21:33.991 --> 21:36.160
–All right, Denny.
–What was the strategy?

21:36.201 --> 21:37.911
Can somebody please explain it to me?

21:37.995 --> 21:39.580
The strategy was there was nothing

21:39.663 --> 21:42.291
our client could really do to renew the ban.

21:42.374 --> 21:43.917
He's therefore not the proximate

21:44.001 --> 21:45.502
cause of the plaintiff's injury.

21:45.586 --> 21:46.325
But that's defensive. Why be

21:46.360 --> 21:48.057
defensive when justice is on our side?

21:48.092 --> 21:49.259
Justice being…

21:49.294 --> 21:50.446
Guns!

21:50.751 --> 21:51.711
There are more guns in American

21:51.746 --> 21:53.657
households than pets, for God sakes,

21:53.692 --> 21:57.264
more guns than cell phones. Guns are hot!

21:57.299 --> 21:58.775
It's not that simple, Denny.

21:58.810 --> 21:59.571
What's simple is this

21:59.606 --> 22:01.791
you don't get on the stand and say,

22:01.826 --> 22:03.433
“I'm sorry for not doing the right thing”.

22:03.468 --> 22:06.044
You testify, “I did the right thing”.

22:06.079 --> 22:07.093
That's how you win lawsuits.

22:07.128 --> 22:10.439
You're right even when you're wrong!

22:22.706 --> 22:24.791
All right. The panties are in the envelope.

22:24.833 --> 22:26.293
But before I give them to you,

22:26.334 --> 22:28.837
we're gonna set a few conditions of our own.

22:28.878 --> 22:30.338
Let me see.

22:31.756 --> 22:33.426
The panties. Let me see

22:33.461 --> 22:35.281
that they're really in there.

22:46.896 --> 22:48.382
Let me have a sample sniff

22:48.417 --> 22:49.868
to assure the authenticity.

22:50.483 --> 22:54.195
I'm not gonna let you smell them now.

22:58.449 --> 23:00.535
Those are new. She never wore them.

23:00.577 --> 23:02.620
Your law career is over, Mr Wells.

23:02.662 --> 23:05.623
All right, look. Let's try another approach.

23:10.545 --> 23:12.630
I will beat you up.

23:12.672 --> 23:14.173
Think I'm kidding? I will

23:14.257 --> 23:15.633
smack you around, reverend.

23:15.675 --> 23:19.011
And what makes you think I wouldn't enjoy that?

23:19.804 --> 23:21.681
I'll be back this afternoon.

23:21.764 --> 23:23.599
And if my terms are not met,

23:23.975 --> 23:27.061
I will go to your superiors.

23:40.908 --> 23:44.370
Awfully tiny cigar.

23:45.746 --> 23:48.082
It's the kind of cigar that goes

23:48.165 --> 23:50.418
along with our wimpy defense today.

23:52.420 --> 23:55.423
Denise and I were discussing it.

23:55.464 --> 23:57.258
We think you're right.

23:57.299 --> 23:59.385
We think maybe…

24:00.719 --> 24:04.265
maybe our approach should be…

24:05.307 --> 24:07.935
guns are good.

24:09.270 --> 24:10.479
But of course they are.

24:10.521 --> 24:13.065
The thing is, I don't really believe it, Denny.

24:13.100 --> 24:14.984
Nor does Denise.

24:15.025 --> 24:17.820
And juries can always tell when

24:17.861 --> 24:20.572
lawyers are being disingenuous.

24:21.991 --> 24:24.618
We need you to close.

24:24.653 --> 24:26.203
Me?

24:33.502 --> 24:35.671
Thing is…

24:35.712 --> 24:39.091
Shirley, I, I don't really do that.

24:39.133 --> 24:41.593
I'm more about…

24:41.760 --> 24:44.096
effect.

24:44.805 --> 24:48.141
This is a big client who is responsible for awarding

24:48.183 --> 24:52.229
this firm many government contracts.

24:52.271 --> 24:54.863
We need you to pull this out.

24:54.898 --> 25:01.238
The, the, the thing about closing, Shirley, is…

25:02.155 --> 25:06.785
too many words. I, I, I, I can't remember them.

25:09.204 --> 25:11.581
Mad cow.

25:11.790 --> 25:15.418
You don't have to remember words, Denny.

25:16.002 --> 25:19.151
This is about assault weapons.

25:19.186 --> 25:22.300
Just speak from your heart.

25:22.342 --> 25:24.928
This is about…

25:24.970 --> 25:27.514
what's dear.

25:46.032 --> 25:48.243
Now what are you doing?

25:49.285 --> 25:52.038
Shirley asked me to close.

25:52.080 --> 25:53.293
I need more time to

25:53.328 --> 25:57.168
prepare. I really, I can't just…

25:57.377 --> 25:59.879
So I'm copying yours.

25:59.921 --> 26:01.673
What do you mean, you're copying mine?

26:01.708 --> 26:03.841
Your closing. It's good stuff.

26:03.883 --> 26:05.677
Do you write it?

26:05.718 --> 26:07.470
You can't just copy my closing.

26:07.553 --> 26:08.554
Why not?

26:08.638 --> 26:10.751
We're on the same team. Don't be such a girl.

26:10.786 --> 26:12.829
Denny, we have completely different cases.

26:12.864 --> 26:16.183
So what? It's not like the jury really listens.

26:16.671 --> 26:20.441
Are you out of your mind?

26:23.986 --> 26:26.239
What's the matter?

26:27.698 --> 26:29.951
I'm afraid.

26:30.910 --> 26:33.357
Afraid of what?

26:35.581 --> 26:36.627
Hey!

26:37.959 --> 26:39.954
–You're Denny Crane.
–No, I'm not.

26:42.463 --> 26:44.486
That's somebody I used to be.

26:46.300 --> 26:47.804
Can you believe the irony?

26:49.553 --> 26:51.472
All I ever really wanted

26:51.555 --> 26:53.391
to do was to rise up one day

26:53.432 --> 26:57.686
and deliver the big summation on behalf of…

26:57.728 --> 26:59.480
A gun.

26:59.522 --> 27:03.651
And now the day finally comes…

27:04.693 --> 27:07.488
and I'm afraid.

27:08.864 --> 27:11.700
The day will be here tomorrow, my friend.

27:11.742 --> 27:14.578
And you won't be afraid. You know why?

27:14.745 --> 27:17.498
You're still Denny Crane.

27:17.539 --> 27:20.251
This I know.

27:25.506 --> 27:27.966
I'm not suggesting you give him your underwear.

27:28.008 --> 27:30.510
–Yes, you are, Garrett.
–I'm not.

27:30.545 --> 27:33.013
I'm saying put these on, and, uh…

27:33.055 --> 27:34.056
You're as sick as he is.

27:34.098 --> 27:35.265
Sara, if this guy reveals..

27:35.349 --> 27:36.578
Where is he?

27:37.267 --> 27:39.329
Waiting in the lobby.

27:53.200 --> 27:54.701
Reverend.

27:55.118 --> 27:56.453
Sara.

27:56.495 --> 27:58.830
You're not getting any of my apparel, reverend.

27:58.865 --> 28:00.374
If you want to tell my superiors

28:00.457 --> 28:02.084
about our little sting, then do it,

28:02.167 --> 28:03.835
knowing the consequences will

28:03.919 --> 28:05.545
be far worse for you than for me.

28:05.629 --> 28:07.589
One sniff, right here.

28:07.673 --> 28:09.383
I'll walk away.

28:11.510 --> 28:14.638
One more slap, we can call the whole matter settled.

28:25.232 --> 28:26.942
Sweet.

28:33.490 --> 28:36.534
There was no self-defense or defense of others here.

28:36.576 --> 28:37.962
I'm not going to waste time

28:37.997 --> 28:39.978
telling you something you already know.

28:41.331 --> 28:43.208
The defendant simply made a

28:43.291 --> 28:45.043
decision, a reflective one,

28:45.085 --> 28:46.961
that Bernard Ferrion should

28:47.045 --> 28:48.797
no longer be among the living.

28:48.838 --> 28:51.091
Two whacks to the back of the head.

28:51.174 --> 28:53.134
Whether Catherine Piper was

28:53.218 --> 28:55.136
playing at executioner or God,

28:55.171 --> 28:58.313
she committed murder.

28:58.348 --> 29:00.975
Law and order isn't simply something

29:01.059 --> 29:03.520
found on television four nights a week.

29:03.555 --> 29:05.069
Our integrity as a people

29:05.104 --> 29:07.523
is inextricably bound up with the

29:07.607 --> 29:09.901
idea that we are a nation of laws.

29:09.943 --> 29:13.741
You, as jurors, took an oath to uphold the law.

29:16.282 --> 29:19.619
In a time when we, as Americans,

29:19.661 --> 29:21.829
are increasingly labeled as

29:21.913 --> 29:23.998
a might-makes-right society,

29:24.040 --> 29:26.125
I sincerely hope,

29:26.167 --> 29:30.213
for our legacy as a moral society,

29:30.254 --> 29:33.247
you choose to honor that oath.

29:43.392 --> 29:45.700
I certainly hope you're good.

29:49.523 --> 29:56.364
In 2003, we had 16,500 murders in this country.

29:56.405 --> 30:00.076
6,200 went unsolved.

30:00.117 --> 30:02.078
On another 4,000, we made arrests.

30:02.161 --> 30:04.080
The defendants eventually went free.

30:04.121 --> 30:07.291
We don't catch killers in this country.

30:07.333 --> 30:11.962
Since 1960, 200,000 murders have gone unsolved.

30:11.997 --> 30:13.047
Forget about the ones where

30:13.130 --> 30:14.173
we just failed to convict.

30:14.256 --> 30:17.092
For 200,000, we were baffled.

30:17.176 --> 30:19.220
Ask me, we could use a few more vigilantes.

30:19.303 --> 30:20.846
Now you swing that skillet

30:20.930 --> 30:22.431
at your own risk, I grant you.

30:22.514 --> 30:24.016
Kill an innocent person,

30:24.099 --> 30:25.601
off to prison you should go.

30:25.684 --> 30:29.357
But Catherine Piper didn't do that.

30:29.392 --> 30:33.031
Catherine Piper tried law and order.

30:33.426 --> 30:35.442
She was scared for her life.

30:35.477 --> 30:38.606
She did fear for the safety of others.

30:39.305 --> 30:40.317
And in the heat of that fear,

30:40.352 --> 30:41.790
she swung that skillet,

30:41.825 --> 30:43.319
accomplishing in the process

30:43.354 --> 30:44.813
something the police couldn't,

30:44.848 --> 30:46.912
she got the bad guy.

30:47.545 --> 30:49.180
Now I certainly don't want

30:49.215 --> 30:50.780
a society where people start

30:50.815 --> 30:53.052
arbitrarily taking the law into their own hands.

30:53.087 --> 30:54.035
I know you don't.

30:54.070 --> 30:57.560
But society certainly isn't safeguarded,

30:57.595 --> 31:00.087
nor is it remotely benefited, by

31:00.122 --> 31:02.579
putting Catherine Piper in prison.

31:04.577 --> 31:06.232
Unlike the district attorney,

31:06.267 --> 31:07.852
I don't think we're a country

31:07.887 --> 31:11.197
inextricably bound up with law and

31:11.232 --> 31:15.126
order or some national integrity.

31:15.161 --> 31:19.021
I like to think we're a people…

31:20.495 --> 31:23.053
mostly about humanity.

31:24.987 --> 31:28.850
And humanity isn't about the

31:28.885 --> 31:32.673
right to trumpet moral superiority.

31:33.311 --> 31:34.933
Humanity…

31:36.741 --> 31:39.433
is about compassion,

31:40.333 --> 31:43.146
even forgiveness.

31:43.799 --> 31:46.864
Catherine Piper, in all her fear,

31:46.899 --> 31:54.355
reacted in a very human way.

31:54.439 --> 31:57.150
She's here now

31:57.233 --> 32:00.421
asking you to do the same.

32:18.546 --> 32:21.341
I thought you'd be better.

32:24.510 --> 32:26.512
–Where the hell is he?
–I don't know.

32:26.554 --> 32:28.431
The last time we spoke, he seemed…

32:28.473 --> 32:30.308
He's supposed to be here closing.

32:30.349 --> 32:32.393
I'll call him on his cell phone, but, Shirley…

32:32.435 --> 32:34.729
The other side has started.

32:34.771 --> 32:36.814
You may have to do this yourself.

32:36.856 --> 32:38.858
Denny's feet seemed a little frozen.

32:38.900 --> 32:41.486
Oh, my God.

32:45.907 --> 32:48.631
–Denny's missing.
–I heard.

32:50.703 --> 32:52.872
How long does a jury deliberate?

32:52.955 --> 32:53.998
There's no rule.

32:54.040 --> 32:56.667
But it could be today.

32:56.709 --> 32:58.461
The judge said he'll keep

32:58.544 --> 33:00.189
them till 10 o'clock tonight.

33:03.090 --> 33:07.136
Alan, whatever happens, thank you.

33:07.178 --> 33:09.305
I mean that.

33:09.805 --> 33:13.809
Baretta said that to his attorney. Brought him luck.

33:19.940 --> 33:22.109
Like congressman Jacobs says,

33:22.151 --> 33:25.779
everybody wants the ban on assault weapons,

33:25.814 --> 33:28.866
the Democrats, the Republicans,

33:28.949 --> 33:31.952
the police, 78% of the public.

33:31.994 --> 33:35.664
And yet, we don't have it.

33:35.699 --> 33:36.915
Why?

33:36.957 --> 33:39.626
The senate majority leader has said, and I quote,

33:39.661 --> 33:42.463
“The will of the American people is

33:42.546 --> 33:45.090
consistent with letting it expire”.

33:45.125 --> 33:47.634
Is that consistent with your will?

33:47.676 --> 33:50.012
With yours?

33:50.429 --> 33:54.234
What the hell is going on here?

33:54.269 --> 33:58.040
The N.R.A. has them all terrified.

33:58.555 --> 34:01.815
How powerful is this lobby?

34:02.149 --> 34:06.528
Senator Kerry, in his bid to get elected president,

34:06.570 --> 34:08.739
was advised that he had to

34:08.780 --> 34:10.866
go out and shoot an animal

34:10.907 --> 34:14.286
and to be photographed doing so.

34:14.328 --> 34:17.664
He's a windsurfer, for God's sake!

34:18.956 --> 34:22.835
Well, enough is enough.

34:22.878 --> 34:27.424
It is time to start holding congress accountable.

34:27.466 --> 34:31.969
3000 deaths by firearms every year in this country.

34:32.012 --> 34:35.181
And we can't ban assault weapons?

34:35.223 --> 34:39.728
People need them for personal protection?

34:39.768 --> 34:41.563
To hunt?

34:41.771 --> 34:44.232
And now we actually have

34:44.315 --> 34:46.735
legislation pending in Washington

34:46.775 --> 34:49.696
that will literally shield the

34:49.779 --> 34:52.574
gun manufacturers from being sued,

34:52.614 --> 34:54.242
even for negligence.

34:54.284 --> 34:57.829
We can sue doctors, big tobacco, asbestos,

34:57.871 --> 34:59.757
but the gun industry gets its own

34:59.792 --> 35:05.712
special legislation granting them immunity.

35:06.254 --> 35:11.342
What the hell is going on?

35:11.384 --> 35:15.683
Where are our elected officials?

35:16.639 --> 35:21.227
This one vowed to fight the gun industry,

35:21.269 --> 35:23.938
took campaign contributions

35:23.980 --> 35:26.531
on the promise that he would.

35:26.566 --> 35:30.028
And what did Alex Naughton get in return?

35:30.069 --> 35:33.031
His 16-year-old nephew,

35:33.072 --> 35:38.594
while buying a quart of milk,

35:38.629 --> 35:44.116
was mowed down by two AK-47s.

36:00.224 --> 36:01.767
You want to take it?

36:01.809 --> 36:03.413
It's all yours.

36:05.354 --> 36:07.067
Denny Crane.

36:08.941 --> 36:10.901
Mr Crane, we do not allow

36:10.985 --> 36:12.862
firearms in the courtroom!

36:12.903 --> 36:16.365
Oh, it's just a prop, judge. It's not…

36:17.700 --> 36:19.869
loaded.

36:26.083 --> 36:27.742
Apologies.

36:37.052 --> 36:39.805
It was the shot heard around the world.

36:39.847 --> 36:41.807
Remember?

36:41.974 --> 36:45.519
Not the punch. Not the stabbing.

36:45.894 --> 36:48.939
It was the shot that rallied the minutemen

36:48.981 --> 36:52.484
to defeat the redcoats at Lexington.

36:52.526 --> 36:54.695
This nation began with a gun,

36:54.737 --> 36:58.240
and we'll go down with a gun, or maybe…

36:58.282 --> 37:00.617
if we have them,

37:00.659 --> 37:03.370
won't go down at all.

37:04.454 --> 37:06.623
Let me tell you about assault weapons.

37:06.665 --> 37:08.715
The FBI now reports that

37:08.750 --> 37:10.878
the terrorists are coming to America to get them

37:10.919 --> 37:13.922
because it's easier to procure them here.

37:13.964 --> 37:15.507
Now I ask you,

37:15.549 --> 37:19.011
how can we supply terrorists with AK-47s

37:19.052 --> 37:22.514
and not give them to our own people?

37:22.556 --> 37:23.932
That may sound crazy.

37:23.974 --> 37:26.143
But part of being an American in

37:26.226 --> 37:28.395
the wild west was we came armed.

37:28.437 --> 37:30.397
It's in the bill of sale, for God sakes.

37:30.480 --> 37:32.010
Bill of rights.

37:32.441 --> 37:34.693
In our national anthem, we've got

37:34.776 --> 37:36.903
bombs bursting in air, for God sakes.

37:36.945 --> 37:38.238
We drive around with our

37:38.321 --> 37:40.073
shotguns on the outside of the pickups

37:40.157 --> 37:43.076
so the neighbors will see them. And…

37:43.660 --> 37:45.745
nobody talks about this out loud, of course,

37:45.787 --> 37:47.289
but things might have turned out

37:47.372 --> 37:49.332
differently for the nephew of the plaintiff

37:49.416 --> 37:55.338
if he had had his own automatic weapon.

37:55.422 --> 37:57.215
The first sound of democracy

37:57.299 --> 37:59.009
came from a gun like this one.

37:59.092 --> 38:02.012
And that's why

38:02.095 --> 38:04.097
the ban on assault weapons

38:04.180 --> 38:06.057
has been allowed to lapse.

38:06.141 --> 38:08.893
It's all about our basic civil rights.

38:08.977 --> 38:11.354
It's about democracy.

38:11.438 --> 38:13.773
It's about freedom!

38:17.944 --> 38:19.696
Denny Crane.

38:34.252 --> 38:37.839
Mr Foreman, has the jury reached a verdict?

38:37.880 --> 38:39.966
–We have, your honor.
–How say you?

38:40.008 --> 38:42.009
In the matter of the commonwealth

38:42.093 --> 38:43.970
of Massachusetts vs Catherine Piper

38:44.011 --> 38:46.305
on the charge of murder in the first degree,

38:46.347 --> 38:49.559
we, the jury, find the defendant…

38:50.226 --> 38:52.854
Is it so much to remember?

38:53.604 --> 38:55.398
Not guilty.

38:55.439 --> 38:57.233
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, Thank

38:57.316 --> 38:59.068
–you for your service.
–Oh, thank God.

38:59.151 --> 39:00.206
–Amen.
–You're dismissed.

39:00.241 --> 39:04.532
I think, I think I might actually cry.

39:04.615 --> 39:07.827
I know I would if it had been guilty.

39:07.910 --> 39:11.497
Mrs. Piper, you are free to go.

39:11.580 --> 39:13.958
–Court is adjourned.
–Congratulations, Catherine.

39:14.041 --> 39:15.876
Thank you.

39:15.960 --> 39:17.169
You know…

39:17.253 --> 39:19.463
in all the time I've known you, Alan,

39:19.547 --> 39:21.716
I don't think I've ever hugged you.

39:21.799 --> 39:23.801
We need to fix that.

39:35.896 --> 39:38.190
–Was it thrilling?
–It actually was.

39:38.232 --> 39:40.484
With all the battles we fight,

39:40.526 --> 39:43.070
we don't often get to wage them on behalf of people

39:43.112 --> 39:44.905
we genuinely care about.

39:44.947 --> 39:47.157
And you, to be able to walk into court

39:47.199 --> 39:49.868
dressed as the mascot for the New england Patriots.

39:49.903 --> 39:51.370
Super bowl champion Patriots.

39:51.453 --> 39:52.454
Yes.

39:52.538 --> 39:54.289
Alan, I was good in there.

39:54.373 --> 39:56.041
I can't be sure, but in the middle,

39:56.125 --> 39:58.752
I think I actually felt smoke coming out of my ass.

39:58.836 --> 40:01.547
–I have no doubt.
–Boys?

40:01.630 --> 40:02.840
Any word?

40:02.923 --> 40:07.427
The jury's still out, which is a miracle.

40:07.511 --> 40:08.971
Denny, your…

40:09.054 --> 40:13.350
your closing was nothing short of unbelievable.

40:13.433 --> 40:14.434
Thank you.

40:14.518 --> 40:16.144
We might actually have a chance

40:16.228 --> 40:17.771
of winning this, although, well,

40:17.854 --> 40:20.482
you heard me say “miracle. ”

40:20.565 --> 40:23.193
I, I just wanted to say that…

40:23.277 --> 40:26.613
you intermittently made sense in there and…

40:26.697 --> 40:28.615
You'll have sex with me.

40:28.699 --> 40:30.283
Come on.

40:30.367 --> 40:32.577
At least pet the musket.

40:32.661 --> 40:34.830
I have a dinner,

40:34.913 --> 40:39.835
but because you've been so good.

40:39.918 --> 40:42.003
Denny Crane.

40:43.171 --> 40:45.215
A quickie.

40:45.257 --> 40:46.925
Nothing for my musket?

40:46.967 --> 40:49.678
Another time.

40:53.473 --> 40:54.808
Alan, you were right.

40:54.849 --> 40:58.061
I still am Denny Crane. I've still got it.

40:58.103 --> 41:01.314
And I've decided for my new year's resolution,

41:01.356 --> 41:03.233
I'm gonna remember that.

41:03.274 --> 41:05.151
What's your resolution?

41:05.193 --> 41:07.612
It's October.

41:09.155 --> 41:12.075
And that's a watch.

41:12.367 --> 41:14.702
October's not too late to make a resolution.

41:14.744 --> 41:16.996
You don't have any?

41:17.038 --> 41:19.290
Mine would be to appreciate

41:19.374 --> 41:21.543
my friends every single day

41:21.584 --> 41:23.086
and catch more fish.

41:23.127 --> 41:25.505
Speaking of which, the rumor appears to be true.

41:25.547 --> 41:26.951
They're catching them up on commonwealth.

41:26.986 --> 41:29.634
Then what the hell are we doing on this balcony?

41:29.669 --> 41:32.283
–Indeed. Cheers, Denny.
–Cheers, my friend.
