where they would rather
spend Thanksgiving.

18:21.101 --> 18:22.166
- Huh, where'd they go?

18:22.168 --> 18:24.802
<i>- And that's how</i>
<i>Bobby and Lori ended up</i>

18:24.804 --> 18:30.408
<i>at the only place in town</i>
<i>that's open 24/7, 365.</i>

18:30.410 --> 18:32.910
<i>Except during fishing season.</i>

18:32.912 --> 18:34.278
- I'm sorry, Boo Boo Bear.

18:34.280 --> 18:35.413
I know you were looking forward

18:35.415 --> 18:38.015
to having a real
Thanksgiving this year.

18:38.017 --> 18:38.883
- It's not all bad.

18:38.885 --> 18:41.152
I found this
half-off turkey jerky.

18:41.154 --> 18:42.353
[horn honks]

18:42.355 --> 18:43.354
[tires screech]

18:43.356 --> 18:44.956
[overlapping chatter]

18:44.958 --> 18:48.059
- Jumping jerky.
Holy hotdogs.

18:48.061 --> 18:50.461
- Whoa, how did you guys
find us?

18:50.463 --> 18:51.395
- Tracking devices.

18:51.397 --> 18:53.531
- You left before trying
my twice-baked tart.

18:53.533 --> 18:56.434
- [scoffs] They would
prefer my flan.

18:56.436 --> 18:58.836
- Flan shman.
Tart, tart, tart.

18:58.838 --> 19:00.338
- Stop.
Don't you guys see?

19:00.340 --> 19:04.308
This is why we left.
We couldn't stand the fighting

19:04.310 --> 19:05.076
and competing.

19:05.078 --> 19:07.945
- We don't want
to choose sides.

19:07.947 --> 19:09.413
So maybe from now on,

19:09.415 --> 19:12.917
we should just spend
Thanksgiving by ourselves.

19:12.919 --> 19:13.651
<i>[rousing music]</i>

19:13.653 --> 19:17.155
- Well, nobody wants that.
- We certainly don't.

19:17.157 --> 19:22.860
- Lori, Bobby, I'm sorry we've
been acting so childlishly.

19:22.862 --> 19:23.628
- We're sorry too.

19:23.630 --> 19:26.264
It's just so hard
to let go of your kids.

19:26.266 --> 19:29.500
You know what?
You should get Lori and Bobby

19:29.502 --> 19:30.334
for Thanksgiving.

19:30.336 --> 19:32.603
- Well, goodness know
we haven't done anything

19:32.605 --> 19:36.307
to deserve that.
They should spend it with you.

19:36.309 --> 19:37.575
- Hey, I got an idea.

19:37.577 --> 19:39.410
Why don't you just
rotate every year, huh?

19:39.412 --> 19:44.415
Much like the juicy hotdogs I'm
selling at a mere 40% mark-up.

19:44.417 --> 19:47.118
Holiday discount.
- Works for us.

19:47.120 --> 19:48.986
- Great idea.
- Yeah.

19:48.988 --> 19:50.922
- I'm glad we figured out
future years,

19:50.924 --> 19:54.292
but what about right now?
I'm starving.

19:54.294 --> 19:57.428
- Well, we've got hotdogs
and sunflower seeds

19:57.430 --> 19:59.463
and twenty kinds
of artisanal jerky.

19:59.465 --> 20:01.666
Maybe we could throw
a dinner together here.

20:01.668 --> 20:02.900
- I'm game.
- Me too.

20:02.902 --> 20:04.402
- We could make this place
look festive.

20:04.404 --> 20:07.939
I think I have some leftover
decorations in the car.

20:07.941 --> 20:08.973
- I'll help you.

20:08.975 --> 20:13.511
- So that's the story of how
old Flip saved Thanksgiving.

20:13.513 --> 20:15.646
<i>Both families coming together</i>
<i>to give thanks</i>

20:15.648 --> 20:20.351
<i>and celebrate the abundance</i>
<i>that is the old Food and Fuel.</i>

20:20.353 --> 20:24.689
- Rosa, this chili-cheese-dog
stuffing is divine.

20:24.691 --> 20:27.225
The habanero sauce
was a nice touch.

20:27.227 --> 20:29.160
- I never leave home
without it.

20:29.162 --> 20:33.464
- It's the perfect combination
of store-bought and homemade.

20:33.466 --> 20:36.701
- I can't believe I finally
got dessert this year.

20:36.703 --> 20:38.002
And a whole aisle's worth.

20:38.004 --> 20:40.037
- And I can't believe
we hit our donation goal

20:40.039 --> 20:42.974
for the food drive.
- Thanks, Flip.

20:42.976 --> 20:44.408
- Eh, don't mention it.

20:44.410 --> 20:46.377
If word gets out that
Flip's a soft touch,

20:46.379 --> 20:48.379
it's all over.
- What do you think, babe?

20:48.381 --> 20:52.416
Best T-giving ever?
- Literally our best so far.

20:52.418 --> 20:54.218
Thanks, Boo Boo Bear.

20:54.220 --> 20:58.122
both: A toast.
- To Thanksgiving traditions.

20:58.124 --> 20:59.457
