WEBVTT

00:12.805 --> 00:14.056
<i>Oh,</i>
<i>that looks good.</i>

00:14.140 --> 00:15.641
<i>- Beychella?</i>
- Quadchella.

00:15.725 --> 00:17.768
The triplets’
17th birthday version.

00:17.852 --> 00:19.812
<i>Triplets?</i>
<i>Aren’t there four?</i>

00:19.895 --> 00:21.147
Well, Olive’s
birthday is tomorrow.

00:21.230 --> 00:22.565
She was born
after midnight.

00:22.648 --> 00:24.817
Anyway... I'm...

00:26.026 --> 00:28.362
I'm going
with Killian,

00:28.446 --> 00:29.739
as in,
like, on a date.

00:29.822 --> 00:31.240
We're dating.
Sort of.

00:31.323 --> 00:32.992
<i>We're</i>
<i>not surprised.</i>

00:33.075 --> 00:35.161
<i>The video he posted</i>
<i>of you was so adorable.</i>

00:35.244 --> 00:37.204
You creeped his profile?

00:37.288 --> 00:39.039
<i>What kind of parents</i>
<i>would we be if we didn't?</i>

00:39.123 --> 00:40.708
<i>We’ll unpack</i>
<i>how you're drawn</i>

00:40.791 --> 00:42.126
<i>to family figures</i>
<i>when we get home.</i>

00:42.209 --> 00:43.919
Oh, so we're fine
with me dating now

00:44.003 --> 00:45.838
after wanting
to send me to Bible camp?

00:45.921 --> 00:47.673
<i>It was the only one</i>
<i>we could book last minute.</i>

00:47.757 --> 00:49.175
<i>Now, if you’d have</i>
<i>sexted a Junior Prof</i>

00:49.258 --> 00:51.051
<i>earlier in the year,</i>

00:51.135 --> 00:53.220
<i>we could’ve packed you</i>
<i>off to swim camp.</i>

00:53.304 --> 00:55.055
<i>Never wanted you not to date,</i>
<i>just wanted better judgement.</i>

00:55.139 --> 00:57.224
<i>Now dating boys</i>
<i>your age</i>

00:57.308 --> 00:59.143
<i>can still have its challenges.</i>
<i>They're all prefrontal cortex</i>

00:59.226 --> 01:01.270
<i>with poor impulse control</i>
<i>and poor hygiene...</i>

01:01.353 --> 01:03.606
Hey, what's more
psychologically disturbing?

01:03.689 --> 01:05.775
Baby head in the toilet
or random limbs?

01:05.858 --> 01:08.152
It's the head, right?
It's gotta be the head.

01:08.235 --> 01:10.279
I thought we were done
with horror pranks.

01:10.362 --> 01:12.239
Yeah, Whoreen said that
someone from “Payne Realty”

01:12.323 --> 01:14.116
is coming by
to look at the cabin,

01:14.200 --> 01:16.035
so I figure
if we let Murder Manor’s

01:16.118 --> 01:17.745
natural gore core
shine through

01:17.828 --> 01:19.789
then maybe we got a shot
at renting it next summer.

01:19.872 --> 01:21.457
Why don't you
put an offer in?

01:21.540 --> 01:23.083
Girl, if I had
that kind of cash...

01:23.167 --> 01:24.376
Yeah,
but Maisy does, right?

01:24.460 --> 01:26.170
Show Maisy the trust.

01:26.253 --> 01:28.005
I know you were saving
it for a big play

01:28.088 --> 01:30.007
but she might help if she
thinks that her dream reno

01:30.090 --> 01:32.802
- all comes to us one day.
- It might persuade her

01:32.885 --> 01:34.595
to buy us out.

01:34.678 --> 01:37.932
Ah man... that would be
enough for a down payment.

01:44.730 --> 01:46.023
Lock up your spouse.

01:46.148 --> 01:48.275
Jayne Payne
will sell da house!

01:49.235 --> 01:50.861
Still workshopping
my tagline.

01:50.945 --> 01:53.781
Jayne,
you’re Payne Realty?

01:53.864 --> 01:56.408
Yeah,
Payne is my maiden name.

01:56.492 --> 02:00.371
No pain, all gain.
With Jayne... not bad.

02:00.454 --> 02:01.997
Well, since when
did real estate

02:02.081 --> 02:03.332
become your
side hustle?

02:03.415 --> 02:05.292
It used to be
my main hustle

02:05.376 --> 02:07.837
but then the girls came and
I had to get out of the life.

02:07.920 --> 02:09.588
It just-- it took too much.

02:09.672 --> 02:11.465
But there's been
some local interest

02:11.549 --> 02:13.759
and Whoreen asked if I
could help and so I thought...

02:13.843 --> 02:15.845
“Let’s see
if she can still dance.”

02:16.846 --> 02:18.931
Teesa’s posts

02:19.014 --> 02:21.934
made this space look
like a lot cuter.

02:22.017 --> 02:24.436
Yeah, we just took
all of our stuff down

02:24.520 --> 02:26.939
so this is
the cabin's original charm.

02:27.022 --> 02:29.692
- Is that blood splatter?
- It's not fresh.

02:29.775 --> 02:31.193
Oh. Okay...

02:34.697 --> 02:36.448
Show Maisy the trust.

02:36.532 --> 02:38.409
Honesty
is the way to go.

02:38.492 --> 02:40.035
Yeah,
it's also a long shot.

02:42.621 --> 02:45.040
Oh, you found
Rosemary's baby head!

02:45.124 --> 02:49.169
"You'd Sing Love"]

02:50.421 --> 02:51.839
- Maiser!
- Ow.

02:54.341 --> 02:56.010
What are you doing
to my favourite shorts?

02:56.093 --> 02:57.469
I’m fixing a button.

02:59.680 --> 03:01.056
You're letting them out?

03:01.140 --> 03:03.809
I-- I told you
that following Opal

03:03.893 --> 03:06.645
on his patisserie journey
would have consequences.

03:06.729 --> 03:09.523
I was supposed to roll
the dough, not become it.

03:09.607 --> 03:12.484
No, no, no, no.
No fatphobic talk, okay?

03:13.319 --> 03:16.030
Pro athletes have such
unrealistic beauty standards.

03:16.113 --> 03:20.034
Long flow, washboard abs,
dumptruck ass...

03:21.827 --> 03:23.329
No man
has all three.

03:24.330 --> 03:27.333
I just... pulled my back
doing a baby gym session.

03:27.416 --> 03:30.377
Tiltapalooza’s next week
and how can I defend my title?

03:30.461 --> 03:32.588
You suck it up
and suck it in.

03:32.671 --> 03:34.548
Go have a shvitz
at Ulrika’s

03:34.632 --> 03:36.050
and loosen
that back up.

03:36.133 --> 03:39.261
Because I married
a ten time champion.

03:40.179 --> 03:41.263
Thanks, babe.

03:44.808 --> 03:45.851
Hello.

03:45.935 --> 03:47.144
Oh.

03:48.520 --> 03:49.563
What do you want?

03:50.147 --> 03:53.359
Um... So... Um...

04:07.289 --> 04:09.416
Dad never told me
about a trust.

04:09.500 --> 04:10.918
Probably 'cause
he's not your dad

04:11.001 --> 04:13.128
but the long
and the short of it is...

04:13.963 --> 04:15.506
the cottage is mine.

04:23.764 --> 04:27.726
But... Derrick
left the cottage to me.

04:27.810 --> 04:28.978
Yes, correct.

04:29.061 --> 04:31.188
But once
you leave it or kick it,

04:31.271 --> 04:32.648
the cottage
comes to me.

04:32.731 --> 04:34.108
Oh, well,
I don't plan

04:34.191 --> 04:35.901
on kicking it
any time soon, so...

04:35.985 --> 04:37.152
Maisy, this is not about us.

04:37.236 --> 04:38.904
This is
about the kids.

04:38.988 --> 04:41.657
And this document says that
any money that you spend

04:41.740 --> 04:44.368
on the cottage goes to Billie,
not Killian and Opal.

04:45.202 --> 04:47.955
Which is why I'm proposing

04:48.038 --> 04:49.915
that you buy me out

04:49.999 --> 04:52.001
for half
the cottage's current value.

04:52.084 --> 04:54.253
Which would be
cheaper than post-reno

04:54.336 --> 04:56.630
and it'll let me put
an offer on the murder cabin.

04:57.840 --> 04:59.425
And then, maybe,
Maisy, we can just put

04:59.508 --> 05:01.969
all this
family drama shit behind us.

05:02.052 --> 05:04.471
I appreciate
you telling me.

05:04.555 --> 05:06.682
Why don't we just go down
to the dock and discuss it?

05:06.765 --> 05:07.975
So you
can drown me?

05:08.058 --> 05:09.351
Not if you push me first.

05:09.435 --> 05:10.728
I'll just grab us
some coffee.

05:11.478 --> 05:12.896
Okay.
All right.

05:12.980 --> 05:14.732
But Billie
knows where I am

05:14.815 --> 05:15.858
just in case
anything happens.

05:15.941 --> 05:16.984
Duly noted.

05:17.067 --> 05:18.277
Are you still four creams?

05:18.360 --> 05:19.945
Black.

05:20.029 --> 05:22.281
Actually, two,
lactose free if you've got it

05:22.364 --> 05:24.408
or oat, almond
in a pinch is fine.

05:25.409 --> 05:26.702
- Thank you.
- Mm-hm.

05:28.370 --> 05:29.997
Honesty
is the way to go.

05:51.560 --> 05:52.603
Dammit.

06:08.327 --> 06:10.454
Smile!
Just-- yeah--

06:10.537 --> 06:11.914
Hey!

06:11.997 --> 06:13.373
Wai-- wait.
Just one sec.

06:13.457 --> 06:15.125
- We’ll do you in a second.
- 17!

06:15.209 --> 06:16.919
Can Olive not be
in this picture, please?

06:17.002 --> 06:18.670
There we go, Olive,
go ahead, get in there.

06:18.754 --> 06:19.963
Okay.

06:20.047 --> 06:21.965
All right.
Looks good.

06:22.049 --> 06:23.759
I feel
a little bit underdressed

06:23.842 --> 06:25.010
next to the Queen B.

06:25.094 --> 06:26.720
Oh, shut it.

06:26.804 --> 06:28.514
Your Jared Leto
is full fashion meth realness.

06:28.597 --> 06:30.641
They wish
they looked so hot.

06:30.724 --> 06:31.809
Hello.

06:32.643 --> 06:33.894
Early birthday gift.

06:35.020 --> 06:36.563
Can-do-nabis.

06:37.981 --> 06:39.274
That is so sweet,
I hate it.

06:42.569 --> 06:43.612
Hey!

06:44.321 --> 06:45.656
Well.

06:45.739 --> 06:47.533
I would like
to say a few words.

06:50.369 --> 06:52.287
My baby girls
are 17, now.

06:53.872 --> 06:54.915
Almost womans...

06:55.916 --> 06:57.417
practically DJs.

07:01.839 --> 07:04.383
Do not take this time
in your life for granted.

07:04.466 --> 07:07.970
You have got to cherish
these ragers without hangovers.

07:10.681 --> 07:11.723
Okay.

07:14.852 --> 07:16.979
And don't forget
to party the fuck on!

07:17.062 --> 07:18.772
- Woo!

07:18.856 --> 07:20.858
- But party safe. Obviously.
- Okay, thanks, Daddy.

07:20.941 --> 07:22.192
- Let's wrap it up.
- Hey, hey, hey,

07:22.276 --> 07:23.527
have you seen your mom?

07:23.610 --> 07:24.820
She left early
this morning.

07:24.903 --> 07:26.238
Okay, no boomers
at Quadchella.

07:26.321 --> 07:28.157
She won’t
take my calls.

07:28.240 --> 07:30.909
Don't forget water.
Drink lots of water, okay?

07:30.993 --> 07:32.786
- You got it.
- The answer is always water!

07:32.870 --> 07:34.663
- Love you, Daddy!
- Bye-yee!

07:34.746 --> 07:36.206
I’m not
cleaning up anyone’s puke!

07:36.290 --> 07:37.416
Except my own.

07:37.499 --> 07:38.959
All right, people.

07:41.461 --> 07:42.713
Let the magic begin.

07:44.381 --> 07:46.133
You know,
when I dropped that trust bomb,

07:46.216 --> 07:48.010
I half-expected you
to come at me with a knife.

07:48.093 --> 07:49.678
It's too messy.

07:49.761 --> 07:51.847
They say that
poison is a woman's weapon.

07:53.348 --> 07:56.101
All right, little bro.
Dad wouldn't want us fighting.

07:56.185 --> 07:57.269
Still, not your dad.

07:57.352 --> 07:59.313
But it is my cottage.

07:59.396 --> 08:01.315
So respectfully,
I have to decline your offer.

08:01.398 --> 08:03.150
It's not an offer.

08:03.233 --> 08:05.277
I'm allowing you,
graciously,

08:05.360 --> 08:08.280
to buy me out so you can
tear down my family cottage

08:08.363 --> 08:10.824
and build some Muskoka
afterbirth with a fugly turret.

08:10.908 --> 08:13.160
It's a Lighthouse gable
and it's not cheap.

08:13.243 --> 08:15.579
Neither is reclaimed wood,
marble countertops

08:15.662 --> 08:17.039
and Opal’s trips to Milan.

08:17.873 --> 08:19.625
We are not in a position
to buy you out.

08:20.375 --> 08:21.418
But...

08:22.586 --> 08:25.464
maybe, we could
redo the bunkie.

08:25.547 --> 08:26.590
Yeah?

08:27.507 --> 08:29.384
Because-- I mean, I'd have to
approve the floor plan.

08:29.468 --> 08:31.803
And I've always really wanted
a fire pole, and like, maybe

08:31.887 --> 08:33.889
a dumbwaiter or a hot waiter
or-- No, Maisy, wait.

08:33.972 --> 08:35.307
This is not
a negotiation.

08:35.390 --> 08:36.475
All right?

08:36.558 --> 08:37.893
If you
don't buy me out,

08:37.976 --> 08:39.186
then everything
goes to Billie.

08:39.269 --> 08:40.562
You have no idea

08:40.646 --> 08:42.022
what goes
into cottage ownership.

08:42.105 --> 08:43.815
It takes commitment,
it takes work,

08:43.899 --> 08:45.150
concepts
that you struggle with.

08:45.234 --> 08:46.526
You can't poison me

08:46.610 --> 08:48.195
with your words
or your dairy.

08:48.278 --> 08:49.655
I know
this was real cream.

08:52.449 --> 08:55.452
I really wish
you hadn't done that.

08:55.535 --> 08:56.954
What the fuck!

08:57.037 --> 08:58.914
That was part
of a really cute set.

08:58.997 --> 09:00.624
You brought
a bone saw?

09:00.707 --> 09:02.876
It's for drywall,
you amateur.

09:06.797 --> 09:08.215
You detached
the dock?

09:08.298 --> 09:09.758
Had to make sure
you wouldn't run away.

09:10.676 --> 09:13.220
Yeah, the grown ups
are at the Boathouse

09:13.303 --> 09:14.596
and the kids
are at Quadchella

09:14.680 --> 09:16.598
so it's just
you and me, baby.

09:17.641 --> 09:19.226
And our
little trust issue.

09:22.104 --> 09:23.188
Help.

09:26.858 --> 09:29.403
Today, we honour
my sisters’ 17th birthday

09:29.486 --> 09:30.862
and the liminal space

09:30.946 --> 09:32.864
between adolescence
and adulthood.

09:32.948 --> 09:34.324
As your Shrooman,

09:34.408 --> 09:35.867
I will guide you
through today's trip.

09:35.951 --> 09:37.411
There are
only three rules.

09:37.494 --> 09:39.246
One,
stay with friends.

09:39.329 --> 09:41.206
Two,
stay in nature.

09:41.290 --> 09:43.625
And three...
stay hydrated.

09:45.210 --> 09:46.837
Ew.
This tastes like trash.

09:47.587 --> 09:48.964
Yeah, it’s poison,
not truffles.

09:51.550 --> 09:53.010
Don't worry.

09:53.093 --> 09:54.720
I secretly micro-dose them
every Christmas.

09:54.803 --> 09:56.555
And it's the only time
they ever show empathy.

10:01.560 --> 10:03.687
Are we
really doing this?

10:04.813 --> 10:07.399
Studies show psilocybin
has therapeutic benefits.

10:07.482 --> 10:09.776
Cures depression, PTSD.

10:14.948 --> 10:16.158
Let's take our medicine.

10:18.577 --> 10:19.619
Cheers.

10:27.419 --> 10:29.546
Mm...

10:29.629 --> 10:32.049
"H.O.T."]

10:41.516 --> 10:44.102
So crazy
how we're all, like...

10:45.228 --> 10:46.521
connected.

10:46.605 --> 10:47.773
You know
what I mean?

10:48.732 --> 10:49.775
See?

10:49.858 --> 10:50.942
Empathy.

10:52.027 --> 10:53.862
Why has everyone
gone full <i>Midsommar</i>

10:53.945 --> 10:56.031
and I feel... nothing?

10:57.282 --> 10:58.325
Same.

10:59.451 --> 11:01.411
- And we ate a ton of pizza.
- Yeah.

11:01.495 --> 11:03.705
Food slows
absorption rate,

11:03.789 --> 11:05.123
anticipation, too.

11:06.083 --> 11:07.959
Relax.
It'll happen.

11:09.628 --> 11:11.421
You're, like, low key

11:11.505 --> 11:14.633
my favourite,
favourite sister!

11:15.801 --> 11:17.344
- Whoa!
- Hi.

11:17.427 --> 11:18.804
- Everything...
- Hi.

11:18.887 --> 11:20.555
Everything
has a heartbeat.

11:25.394 --> 11:29.523
The step-crushins
are totally gonna bone.

11:29.606 --> 11:31.024
Stop that.

11:31.108 --> 11:32.609
Okay, let’s go.

11:32.692 --> 11:34.945
- Where?
- To get some privacy.

11:35.028 --> 11:36.363
Really?
What?

11:37.197 --> 11:38.490
Don’t over think it.

11:38.573 --> 11:40.033
What--
Well, I mean--

11:41.535 --> 11:44.162
I mean we should maybe
overthink it a little bit.

11:44.246 --> 11:45.497
I don't want
to pull a Justin.

11:47.624 --> 11:48.708
I mean...

11:49.626 --> 11:52.671
you can pull out
but things do happen fast,

11:52.754 --> 11:54.256
faster than maybe
you want--

11:54.339 --> 11:56.216
Okay, stop
before I pull out, right now.

11:57.092 --> 11:59.761
We'll get some condoms,
then some privacy.

12:10.397 --> 12:11.648
Hey, Riley!

12:12.482 --> 12:13.942
I am honoured.

12:14.025 --> 12:15.777
What brings
Queen Bey to the woods?

12:15.861 --> 12:18.280
Your note at the Gas & Go said
you'd be back in five?

12:18.363 --> 12:20.365
I got a hot tip
from a buddy of Highway Patrol

12:20.449 --> 12:22.284
that a swan
got clipped around here.

12:23.326 --> 12:26.079
So if I find it, I can finally
finish the season five finale.

12:26.163 --> 12:27.914
Any chance you could
open up the shop for us?

12:27.998 --> 12:29.666
We were just
getting snacks and--

12:29.749 --> 12:31.293
Condoms.

12:31.376 --> 12:32.586
Whoa.

12:33.837 --> 12:34.880
Big day.

12:36.214 --> 12:37.591
It’s too bad,
the Hendersons,

12:37.674 --> 12:39.259
they cleared us out
this morning.

12:39.342 --> 12:41.470
But Saggy B and Whoreen
don't live too far away.

12:41.553 --> 12:42.846
I'm sure
they would help the cause.

12:43.597 --> 12:44.639
Killian
could should you.

12:46.141 --> 12:47.976
You-- you want me
to just ask them.

12:48.059 --> 12:50.562
Well... Ulrika’s really
been pushing her Womb Wash.

12:51.396 --> 12:52.564
Apparently
it works on chickens.

12:53.398 --> 12:55.192
We just have to ask to use
the Hendersons’ bathroom,

12:55.275 --> 12:56.776
grab a few
and bounce.

12:56.860 --> 12:58.445
What? A few?

12:58.528 --> 13:00.363
First times always
require a second act.

13:00.447 --> 13:03.783
But... just leave
a few for Saggy B.

13:03.867 --> 13:06.161
STI’s are tearing
through the senior’s community.

13:09.748 --> 13:10.957
It's not funny, guys.

13:11.041 --> 13:12.209
It's a serious problem.

13:12.292 --> 13:13.543
Sure.

13:17.714 --> 13:19.424
You two
are tripping balls.

13:19.508 --> 13:20.550
Come on.

13:22.969 --> 13:25.138
Don’t tell Justin, okay?

13:25.222 --> 13:26.848
That’s gonna get weird.

13:26.932 --> 13:28.016
Yup.

13:30.435 --> 13:32.687
You can't just
bring someone on a dock, Maisy.

13:32.771 --> 13:34.731
I mean,
this is entrapment!

13:34.814 --> 13:36.233
You're free to leave.

13:36.316 --> 13:37.817
Well,
yeah but I just--

13:37.901 --> 13:39.277
I've never been
this far out before

13:39.361 --> 13:40.779
without a pool noodle.

13:40.862 --> 13:43.573
You better hurry.
Storm’s a-comin’.

13:43.657 --> 13:46.117
Yes, because
you poisoned me with dairy.

13:46.952 --> 13:48.662
Not just dairy.

13:48.745 --> 13:50.163
No, you’re just--
you’re just messing with me.

13:50.247 --> 13:52.624
This is just--
this is just anxiety,

13:52.707 --> 13:55.293
a little bit
of coffee... and my EBS.

13:55.377 --> 13:57.295
- Excitable Bowel Syndrome--
- EBS is real, Maisy!

13:57.379 --> 13:58.922
- Is not a thing.
- Look it up!

14:00.465 --> 14:01.591
Just hold on, just--

14:02.342 --> 14:04.094
I’m just gonna hold on.
I'm gonna hold it in.

14:05.595 --> 14:07.013
That's fine.
I'm fine.

14:07.097 --> 14:09.349
I can swim to shore
in a tight ten.

14:09.432 --> 14:10.725
I'll have
a boat here in five.

14:10.809 --> 14:12.018
You tear up
that trust

14:12.102 --> 14:13.478
and the throne
is yours in 20--

14:13.562 --> 14:15.313
No!
You can’t erase me

14:15.397 --> 14:17.399
and you can't
erase Billie...

14:17.482 --> 14:20.694
who's the real grandchild
and Dad's trust confirms it.

14:20.777 --> 14:23.196
Blood is thicker
than water.

14:23.280 --> 14:25.282
Is that what you tell
Billie's parents?

14:25.365 --> 14:27.242
Ugh! God!

14:27.325 --> 14:29.244
Maisy,
all I am asking for, here,

14:29.327 --> 14:30.662
is what's rightfully mine.

14:30.745 --> 14:32.289
- Yours?
- Yes!

14:32.372 --> 14:34.791
I earned every
square inch of that cottage.

14:34.874 --> 14:37.335
I turned this place
from a racist fridge magnet

14:37.419 --> 14:38.753
into the next Muskoka.

14:38.837 --> 14:40.672
And I did it
with the entire Lake

14:40.755 --> 14:43.008
thinking that I slept
with my stepdad to get it!

14:43.091 --> 14:45.635
While his sad, gay son
gave up his baby

14:45.719 --> 14:47.429
and his 32 inch waist,

14:47.512 --> 14:49.723
I was being crucified
while you were in Australia

14:49.806 --> 14:51.725
getting your micro dick
sucked by a Hemsworth.

14:51.808 --> 14:55.270
A Coffs Harbour Hemsworth,
they're not the same.

14:55.353 --> 14:56.980
I have bent

14:57.063 --> 14:59.107
these generational
mouth breathers to my will.

14:59.190 --> 15:01.026
And I think it's really
adorable that you think

15:01.109 --> 15:02.902
you can come in here
and take what's rightfully mine

15:02.986 --> 15:04.362
just because your granddaddy

15:04.446 --> 15:06.031
built some shit shack
on the Lake.

15:07.699 --> 15:09.868
I am going to tear
that baby to the studs

15:09.951 --> 15:12.495
and build an Architectural
Digest centerfold.

15:12.579 --> 15:15.624
Goldie and Kurt
are gonna lose it.

15:15.707 --> 15:18.168
Well, it sounds
gorge and I can't wait

15:18.251 --> 15:20.545
to inherit it when you die
because the only thing

15:20.629 --> 15:23.214
that I'm dissolving
is a Tums in water.

15:23.298 --> 15:24.341
Do you have any?

15:25.175 --> 15:27.636
Do you really think that you
and your excitable bowel

15:27.719 --> 15:28.887
can outlive me?

15:29.596 --> 15:32.098
- I'm younger.
- I'm stronger.

15:32.182 --> 15:33.808
I've had to
shit since we got here

15:33.892 --> 15:35.352
but nobody tells me
what to do.

15:35.435 --> 15:36.853
Not even
my own asshole.

15:37.646 --> 15:38.813
- Oh no.

15:39.689 --> 15:40.857
Oh, my God.

15:40.940 --> 15:42.400
Oh, my God,
no, it's coming.

15:42.484 --> 15:44.235
Oh, my God, Maisy,
it’s coming.

15:44.319 --> 15:46.363
- Then, get in the Lake.

15:51.826 --> 15:53.870
- Hi! Hi ya, kids.
- Hi.

15:56.498 --> 15:58.208
We-- we were on a hike

15:58.291 --> 16:00.168
and I needed
to use the bathroom.

16:00.251 --> 16:02.712
Of course, sweetie,
down the hall.

16:02.796 --> 16:04.506
If it's brown...

16:04.589 --> 16:06.341
- Flush it down.

16:06.424 --> 16:08.259
Cool windchime.

16:09.302 --> 16:10.845
It was my mother's
favourite...

16:10.929 --> 16:12.764
before she died
of a broken heart.

16:13.682 --> 16:15.266
And cirrhosis.

16:15.350 --> 16:17.727
How do the colours
do that, though?

16:17.811 --> 16:19.020
It looks like
they’re dancing.

16:20.814 --> 16:23.316
I think you've had
too much sun, dear.

16:24.234 --> 16:25.819
Go and get Billie
something to drink.

16:25.902 --> 16:27.487
- Yeah.

16:30.782 --> 16:32.492
I got it. Let's go.

16:32.575 --> 16:33.910
Oh, oh, bye.

16:37.038 --> 16:38.790
Is that my bathrobe?

16:42.585 --> 16:43.920
What’s up
with this?

16:44.838 --> 16:46.172
Never seen
you here this early.

16:48.675 --> 16:50.385
Huh. Uh-oh.

16:50.468 --> 16:51.928
Trouble in paradise?

16:52.011 --> 16:53.722
No, no,
it's all good.

16:53.805 --> 16:54.889
You know,
the kids are good.

16:55.640 --> 16:57.517
Maisy's good, but...

16:59.519 --> 17:01.229
You ever wish
you could stop time?

17:02.147 --> 17:03.982
It’s not a wish, bud,
sunk a boatload

17:04.065 --> 17:05.358
into some
time machine startups.

17:05.442 --> 17:06.651
Just waitin’
to cash in.

17:07.819 --> 17:11.698
It’s like... when did
our bodies stop playing fair?

17:13.366 --> 17:15.452
Dude,
we’re as young as we feel.

17:16.703 --> 17:18.538
Hey, take your last season.

17:19.873 --> 17:21.040
You weren't scoring.

17:21.124 --> 17:22.584
They cut your ice time.

17:23.835 --> 17:25.295
But did you
leave the party?

17:25.378 --> 17:26.796
Uh-uh. Yeah.

17:26.880 --> 17:28.423
You handled that noise.

17:28.506 --> 17:30.884
That is why
you are Vic-The-Stick.

17:30.967 --> 17:32.510
Yup.

17:32.594 --> 17:35.472
Hey! Who gives a fuck
what people say, anyway?

17:35.555 --> 17:36.639
Most of us.

17:37.265 --> 17:38.600
- Oh no,

17:38.683 --> 17:40.602
you are not
pooping on my dock.

17:40.685 --> 17:42.061
Get your ass
in the Lake.

17:42.145 --> 17:43.688
No, I'm a home pooper.

17:43.772 --> 17:46.149
And there's this
tiny Amazonian catfish

17:46.232 --> 17:48.109
that can lodge itself
in your urethra.

17:48.193 --> 17:49.903
You come to my house

17:49.986 --> 17:51.654
and you try
to extort my cottage.

17:51.738 --> 17:54.240
You throw my triple glazed
French mug into the water

17:54.324 --> 17:55.825
and yet
you're the victim.

17:55.909 --> 17:57.368
Justin
is always the victim.

17:57.452 --> 17:59.537
You knew
I was lactose intolerant!

17:59.621 --> 18:01.122
“Oh, I'm gay,

18:01.206 --> 18:03.291
I gave up my baby,
I can't do dairy."

18:03.374 --> 18:05.168
Everybody feel
sorry for Justin.

18:05.251 --> 18:06.461
You know what?

18:06.544 --> 18:07.670
Justin
never does the work.

18:07.754 --> 18:09.339
Like you did?

18:09.422 --> 18:11.633
Sucking up to a racist
homophobe like my dad?

18:11.716 --> 18:13.301
And who
cured him of that?

18:13.384 --> 18:14.594
- Me!
- Yes,

18:14.677 --> 18:16.429
a cis straight
white woman

18:16.513 --> 18:18.556
who's never been affected
by any of that in her life.

18:18.640 --> 18:20.433
And I did it
before I turned 30.

18:20.517 --> 18:22.018
- You know what?

18:22.101 --> 18:24.062
I was really hoping
that when I saw you

18:24.145 --> 18:25.855
at the boathouse barbecue,

18:25.939 --> 18:27.315
things would be
different between us.

18:27.398 --> 18:29.234
All I ever wanted
was a big sister.

18:29.317 --> 18:31.528
And all I ever wanted
was to not come second

18:31.611 --> 18:33.071
to a talking mudslide.

18:33.154 --> 18:34.823
Oh,
I’ll show you a mudslide!

18:35.573 --> 18:37.367
What?
No, no, no! That--

18:37.450 --> 18:39.619
Don't you dare.
Don't pull your pants down.

18:41.329 --> 18:42.747
That was
hand woven in Marseille.

18:44.082 --> 18:45.416
Oh!

18:46.751 --> 18:48.044
The vibes are weird.

18:48.878 --> 18:50.505
Something's wrong.

18:50.588 --> 18:52.090
Who invited
the kids to Quadchella?

18:52.173 --> 18:54.050
Oh no.
They aged backwards.

18:54.133 --> 18:56.427
It's the only
logical explanation.

18:56.511 --> 18:58.513
See, the triplets.

18:58.596 --> 19:00.181
That is what happens

19:00.265 --> 19:01.349
when you appropriate
fairy culture.

19:02.141 --> 19:04.143
Oh no...
it's Olive.

19:05.520 --> 19:06.688
And Lil Wayne.

19:09.315 --> 19:11.734
We have to
re-bigulate them.

19:16.573 --> 19:19.325
How do we turn you
back, Lil Wayne?

19:19.409 --> 19:20.535
Water!

19:20.618 --> 19:21.870
That's it.
Remember?

19:21.953 --> 19:23.037
Wayne told us.

19:23.121 --> 19:24.747
Water’s the answer.

19:24.831 --> 19:26.416
It's always the answer.

19:28.126 --> 19:30.211
We need
to hose 'em down.

19:30.295 --> 19:31.713
We gotta make it fun.
They’re just kids.

19:31.796 --> 19:32.964
Water balloons.

19:37.427 --> 19:38.887
This is the sacrifice
we have to make.

19:43.892 --> 19:46.936
So...
<i>question pour</i> Victor...

19:47.812 --> 19:51.065
What do you and Maisers do
when you hit a hump-slump?

19:51.149 --> 19:52.567
Juice cleanse, usually.

19:56.571 --> 19:57.822
So...

19:58.948 --> 20:00.074
the other day...

20:00.867 --> 20:02.410
Jayney wants
to play a new game

20:03.161 --> 20:05.455
and I'm like
“I'm here for it babe.

20:05.538 --> 20:06.873
- What do you got?”
- Yeah.

20:06.956 --> 20:08.333
- So she ties me up.
- Yeah.

20:08.416 --> 20:10.251
- Gags me.
- Nice.

20:10.335 --> 20:11.586
- Then she leaves.
- Sweet.

20:11.669 --> 20:13.296
Yeah, for,
like, four hours.

20:13.379 --> 20:15.089
- Not so sweet.
- Yeah, she went to run errands.

20:15.173 --> 20:17.717
Like, look, I know
I have to be supportive

20:17.800 --> 20:19.969
but I honestly
did not like that game.

20:22.388 --> 20:23.806
I don't think
it was a game, Wayner.

20:24.599 --> 20:25.892
I think
she wanted some me-time.

20:26.643 --> 20:28.311
Me-time?

20:28.394 --> 20:29.562
No way.

20:31.314 --> 20:32.982
My girl doesn't want
to party with me.

20:33.066 --> 20:34.817
My girls
don't party with me!

20:34.901 --> 20:36.110
I'm still the party.

20:36.945 --> 20:38.029
Nothing's changed.

20:41.074 --> 20:42.909
You spilled some...

20:45.119 --> 20:46.454
Thanks for the advice,
Wayner.

20:47.038 --> 20:49.916
Dude,
I'm full of great advice...

20:50.583 --> 20:51.834
but does anyone
listen to me?

20:51.918 --> 20:54.504
- Shit. No.
- I can't hear you.

20:54.587 --> 20:57.006
If you see Jayney,
would you tell her to call me?

21:06.975 --> 21:08.059
We did it.

21:09.227 --> 21:10.645
They’re all wet.

21:10.728 --> 21:12.397
They should
re-bigulate any minute.

21:13.231 --> 21:14.565
Yeah.

21:16.859 --> 21:18.111
What the--

21:19.946 --> 21:21.155
Killian.

21:22.907 --> 21:23.992
See?

21:24.075 --> 21:25.868
We had to
re-bigulate them.

21:25.952 --> 21:27.578
Quadchella
is two doors up.

21:30.581 --> 21:31.833
Yes, ma’am.

21:31.916 --> 21:34.293
- Sorry ma'am.

21:34.377 --> 21:36.087
What the fuck?

21:42.552 --> 21:43.636
Oh.

21:45.054 --> 21:46.139
Oh, God.

21:48.182 --> 21:49.350
- Hey, Dad?
- Hey, son.

21:50.101 --> 21:51.686
Got a minute?

21:51.769 --> 21:53.521
If this is about
the talent show postmortem,

21:53.604 --> 21:54.856
I'm still not ready.

21:55.606 --> 21:57.316
No, that's not
why I'm here.

22:02.113 --> 22:03.156
Oh!

22:06.325 --> 22:08.745
Look, I know your body is
going through some changes...

22:09.620 --> 22:11.039
but I just want
to let you know

22:11.122 --> 22:12.999
that manopause
is perfectly normal.

22:14.375 --> 22:15.793
Manopause?

22:16.711 --> 22:17.754
They’re one size up.

22:18.546 --> 22:19.964
I'm good.

22:20.048 --> 22:21.382
You know, back on
the intermittent fasting.

22:21.466 --> 22:22.759
- I’m feeling great--
- Stop.

22:22.842 --> 22:24.385
You are not
some sad has-been

22:24.469 --> 22:26.137
clinging
to their golden age.

22:26.220 --> 22:27.513
Now,
embrace the curves.

22:39.525 --> 22:40.985
Oh...

22:42.445 --> 22:44.280
Hm...

22:44.363 --> 22:45.490
Hmph.

22:45.573 --> 22:47.158
Oh.

22:48.284 --> 22:49.744
So how do you feel?

22:50.495 --> 22:51.579
They're okay.

22:52.330 --> 22:53.664
Yeah!

22:53.748 --> 22:56.000
I'm-- I'm okay.

22:57.418 --> 23:00.797
That's it.
Work it, Daddy. Work!

23:00.880 --> 23:02.215
- Yeah!
- Yeah.

23:02.298 --> 23:04.092
Yeah, I feel good.
Thanks, coach.

23:04.175 --> 23:06.511
Oh, I'm gonna queue up
a Brené Brown playlist.

23:06.594 --> 23:08.221
We shouldn't have
made you go cold turkey.

23:08.971 --> 23:10.681
Thank you, son!

23:10.765 --> 23:12.767
I'm gonna make you proud.
I'm gonna be a new man.

23:14.977 --> 23:16.270
Yes!

23:18.356 --> 23:20.024
This was
a limited run.

23:20.108 --> 23:21.943
You always
ruin everything!

23:22.026 --> 23:24.487
You always ruin everything.
You ruined my family!

23:24.570 --> 23:25.947
You ruined my cottage,

23:26.030 --> 23:27.824
you ruined
my childhood innocence!

23:27.907 --> 23:29.575
God, would you get over that?
We were kids.

23:29.659 --> 23:30.952
You tricked me

23:31.035 --> 23:32.954
into finding our
parents 69-ing.

23:33.037 --> 23:34.497
We were playing Sardines.

23:34.580 --> 23:36.749
You told me
where to look!

23:36.833 --> 23:38.167
Oh, grow up.

23:38.251 --> 23:39.460
They had been
fucking for years.

23:39.544 --> 23:40.962
I was doing you
a favour.

23:41.045 --> 23:42.296
You were
doing me trauma.

23:42.380 --> 23:43.798
I was eight years old.

23:43.881 --> 23:45.383
I didn’t know
that my dad was...

23:45.466 --> 23:48.219
- having an affair.
- The entire Lake knew!

23:48.302 --> 23:49.720
What did you think,
that my mom

23:49.804 --> 23:51.848
was some work friend
who was staying

23:51.931 --> 23:53.224
- at your cottage for a week?
- Yes!

23:53.307 --> 23:54.600
Because
I was eight, Maisy.

23:54.684 --> 23:56.144
Not Dorothy Fucking Parker!

23:56.227 --> 23:59.021
Oh, you could
never accept reality.

23:59.105 --> 24:00.857
You still live
in a fucking fantasy world!

24:00.940 --> 24:03.109
I always have to have
my shit on lock

24:03.192 --> 24:04.902
but you get to be
an endless shit show.

24:04.986 --> 24:07.363
Maybe that's why you're
such a constipated shrew!

24:07.446 --> 24:08.489
Oh!

24:08.573 --> 24:09.991
You know what?

24:10.074 --> 24:11.701
I don't care
what your dad wanted.

24:11.784 --> 24:13.244
I don't even care
what that document says.

24:13.327 --> 24:14.871
The cottage is mine.

24:14.954 --> 24:17.456
It belongs to my kids
and I will eat shit

24:17.540 --> 24:19.292
before you and Billie
take it from me.

24:19.375 --> 24:21.335
I will come for you.

24:21.419 --> 24:23.504
I will come
for your kids.

24:23.588 --> 24:24.881
And then...

24:28.134 --> 24:29.635
Are you taking
a dramatic pause?

24:29.719 --> 24:31.179
I’m taking
a dramatic shit.

24:31.888 --> 24:33.931
Oh! Oh, God!

24:35.349 --> 24:37.810
Lovejoy wins!

24:37.894 --> 24:39.604
We lost the condom

24:39.687 --> 24:42.440
but we saved
the bathrobe.

24:44.650 --> 24:46.485
So soft.

24:46.569 --> 24:47.653
I know.

24:48.738 --> 24:50.489
Saved something...

25:09.634 --> 25:10.801
Is this okay?

25:11.761 --> 25:14.055
- Yes.
- You sure you want to? Yeah?

25:21.437 --> 25:23.397
Because I'm Justin
and you’re Maisy.

25:24.440 --> 25:26.025
It all
makes sense now.

25:26.108 --> 25:27.568
Justin and your mom
never got re-bigulated

25:27.652 --> 25:29.070
so they are stuck
in the past

25:29.153 --> 25:30.655
but we can
unstuck them.

25:32.240 --> 25:33.991
By having sex?

25:34.075 --> 25:36.994
See, it's all because
your mom stole our cottage.

25:37.078 --> 25:38.704
- Wait, your cottage?
- Yes,

25:38.788 --> 25:40.289
it's in grandpa's will.

25:40.373 --> 25:41.916
That's why Justin and me
have been trying

25:41.999 --> 25:43.501
to steal it back.

25:43.584 --> 25:45.086
- I'm an idiot!
- You've been trying

25:45.169 --> 25:47.004
- to steal our cottage?
- What? No, not me.

25:47.088 --> 25:49.590
Well... sort of.
But only to help you.

25:50.675 --> 25:51.759
I need to sit down.

25:52.468 --> 25:53.928
I am sitting down.

25:54.011 --> 25:55.596
You know,
I wasn't even on board at first

25:55.680 --> 25:57.473
but your mom
is kind of a bitch.

25:57.556 --> 25:59.308
She can be a bit harsh,
but she’s--

25:59.392 --> 26:00.851
Oh, my God, Killian!
Don't you see?

26:00.935 --> 26:02.395
If we have sex,

26:02.478 --> 26:04.397
we re-bigulate
our family’s past,

26:04.480 --> 26:05.982
we bring our parents
back together.

26:06.816 --> 26:08.567
This is what
our grandpa would want

26:08.651 --> 26:09.735
if he were here, today.

26:10.653 --> 26:13.197
Grandpa Derrick wants us
to have sex to save the family?

26:14.156 --> 26:15.241
Exactly.

26:16.117 --> 26:17.410
We have to
fuck for grandpa.

26:19.328 --> 26:20.621
Whoa. Stop!

26:20.705 --> 26:21.914
What’s wrong?

26:21.998 --> 26:23.582
You tried
to steal my cottage

26:23.666 --> 26:24.709
and you lied to me.

26:27.128 --> 26:28.838
I'm not
feeling this anymore.

26:37.346 --> 26:39.098
I feel better now
that I got that out.

26:39.932 --> 26:41.309
The memory
or the turd?

26:44.812 --> 26:46.355
Maisy,
how do we fix this?

26:46.439 --> 26:49.108
We can't, unless we both
get what we want.

26:49.900 --> 26:51.360
Hemsworth threesome?

26:51.986 --> 26:53.529
Oh...

26:54.739 --> 26:56.240
It's not our fault.

26:56.324 --> 26:57.742
We never wanted
to be brother and sister.

26:59.368 --> 27:00.661
I guess
we can get a lawyer.

27:01.829 --> 27:02.913
Or...

27:03.706 --> 27:05.124
We could
solve it like adults.

27:09.462 --> 27:11.088
Sacred blood oath?

27:11.172 --> 27:13.716
- Trial by tilt?
- Next weekend, Tiltapalooza.

27:13.799 --> 27:15.051
If I win...

27:15.134 --> 27:16.469
you buy me out...

27:16.552 --> 27:18.679
and I take
my name off the trust.

27:18.763 --> 27:20.181
And if I win,
you take your name

27:20.264 --> 27:21.599
off the trust
and you walk away.

27:33.444 --> 27:34.653
- Quadchella-works.

27:57.009 --> 27:59.011
Oh, my God.

27:59.095 --> 28:00.429
Hey, Miss Carter.

28:00.513 --> 28:01.931
It’s Knowles Carter.

28:02.848 --> 28:04.225
Jay-Z was lucky
she gave him that.

28:09.772 --> 28:11.023
Is my bedroom free?

28:12.024 --> 28:13.818
Yeah. Sorry.

28:15.236 --> 28:17.321
It got kind of messy
with Killian.

28:17.405 --> 28:19.990
I'm a squirtter, too.
I'll change the sheets.

28:20.074 --> 28:21.325
What? No.

28:21.409 --> 28:22.493
Not like that.

28:23.244 --> 28:24.662
It's--

28:25.746 --> 28:27.957
- it's over.
- Aw.

28:29.291 --> 28:30.376
We’re over.

28:32.628 --> 28:34.422
Cottage parties
are all drama...

28:35.423 --> 28:37.174
but it all works out
in the morning.

28:40.636 --> 28:42.805
But it's probably
for the best.

28:42.888 --> 28:45.599
No one should marry
their first crush at the Lake.

28:47.852 --> 28:48.894
No one.

28:52.898 --> 28:54.191
How’d the viewings go?

28:57.027 --> 28:58.654
Most ran out
screaming...

28:59.864 --> 29:01.949
but it was good
to be back in the saddle.

29:05.119 --> 29:06.412
It sounds crazy...

29:08.205 --> 29:09.790
but the houses
speak to me.

29:13.252 --> 29:14.545
They tell me
who they want.

29:15.421 --> 29:17.006
How much
to go above asking.

29:22.261 --> 29:23.554
Do you hear?

29:25.014 --> 29:26.515
They're talking
to me right now.

29:35.191 --> 29:36.525
Oh, um--

30:03.677 --> 30:05.221
Sorry about your bag.

30:05.846 --> 30:07.181
It was really pretty.

30:08.224 --> 30:09.975
Meh.
I got it at Target.

30:12.228 --> 30:13.979
Man, you really
are the worst.

30:14.063 --> 30:15.356
