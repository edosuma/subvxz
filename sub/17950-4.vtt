10:13.213 --> 10:14.815
HA-HA.

10:17.785 --> 10:19.286
- IT SEEMED
LIKE A GOOD INVESTMENT.

10:19.286 --> 10:21.621
BUT IT TURNS OUT,
LUCY DOESN'T LIKE SNAKES.

10:21.621 --> 10:23.390
AND NOW HE'S SAD.

10:23.390 --> 10:24.892
- SNAKES DON'T GET SAD.

10:24.892 --> 10:26.559
THEY GET HUNGRY AND COLD.

10:26.559 --> 10:29.963
AND YOU NEED TO GET HIM FOOD,
A HEAT LAMP, AND A CAGE.

10:29.963 --> 10:34.067
- HOW MUCH
IS ALL THAT GONNA COST ME?

10:34.067 --> 10:36.036
$1,000?

10:36.036 --> 10:38.972
- WELL, THERE ARE A LOT OF
HIDDEN COSTS IN OWNING A PET.

10:38.972 --> 10:40.774
AND--WHERE IS HE?

10:40.774 --> 10:42.575
- HMM?

10:42.575 --> 10:44.812
I LEFT HIM RIGHT THERE
ON THE TABLE.

10:44.812 --> 10:48.281
- YOU LEFT HIM
ON THE TABLE?

10:48.281 --> 10:49.717
[screaming]

10:57.991 --> 10:59.693
- GORDON!

10:59.693 --> 11:01.762
GORDON!

11:03.831 --> 11:06.599
- OKAY, JUST BUY $5,000
WORTH OF SUN SQUEEZED STOCK.

11:06.599 --> 11:08.068
- I CAN DO IT.

11:08.068 --> 11:09.569
YOU DON'T HAVE
TO TELL ME EVERYTHING.

11:09.569 --> 11:11.138
- FINE.

11:11.138 --> 11:13.406
ONCE YOU SELECT "BUY,"
YOU'LL HEAR A HAPPY BEEP.

11:13.406 --> 11:14.942
THEN YOUR TRANSACTION
IS COMPLETE.

11:14.942 --> 11:16.744
- OKAY.

11:16.744 --> 11:18.245
AND WITH ONE CLICK
OF A BUTTON,

11:18.245 --> 11:21.248
I AM RESPONSIBLE
WITH MY MONIES.

11:23.650 --> 11:25.753
- WHERE'S THE BEEP?

11:25.753 --> 11:27.087
AFTER YOU BUY STOCK,
THERE'S A HAPPY BEEP.

11:27.087 --> 11:28.155
- I DON'T KNOW.

11:28.155 --> 11:29.757
I WENT
TO THE SUN SQUEEZED WEBSITE

11:29.757 --> 11:32.059
AND BOUGHT $5,000
WORTH OF ORANGES.

11:32.059 --> 11:33.927
- NO!

11:33.927 --> 11:35.763
YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO GO
TO THE FINANCIAL WEBSITE

11:35.763 --> 11:39.032
AND BUY $5,000 WORTH
OF SUN SQUEEZED STOCK.

11:40.133 --> 11:42.435
- IS THAT BAD?

11:42.435 --> 11:45.873
[truck beeping]

11:47.174 --> 11:48.641
IS THAT THE BEEP
YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT?

11:48.641 --> 11:49.642
- NO!

11:49.642 --> 11:53.680
- * AH, AH, AH-AH, OH

11:53.680 --> 11:56.784
* AH, AH, AH-AH, OH

12:00.788 --> 12:01.789
- MOM!

12:01.789 --> 12:03.556
WHAT'S FOR BREAKFAST?

12:03.556 --> 12:06.093
- ORANGE SLICES,
ORANGE WEDGES,

12:06.093 --> 12:09.396
AND A BOWL OF ORANGES.

12:09.396 --> 12:10.663
- KATIE!

12:10.663 --> 12:12.432
- OKAY, I HAVE SUN SQUEEZED
ORANGES ON THE LINE.

12:12.432 --> 12:14.467
I EXPLAINED TO THEM THAT
YOU WERE TRYING TO BUY STOCK

12:14.467 --> 12:16.536
NOT ORANGES AND ASKED
IF THEY'LL GIVE YOU A REFUND.

12:16.536 --> 12:18.605
- OKAY, HOW'S IT GOING.

12:18.605 --> 12:20.673
[laughter over speakerphone]

12:22.442 --> 12:24.211
- LOOK, KID...

12:24.211 --> 12:25.913
THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME
TO STAY ON YOUR COUCH LAST NIGHT

12:25.913 --> 12:27.915
AND FOR SIGNING THIS ORANGE
FOR MY DAUGHTER.

12:27.915 --> 12:30.818
BUT I GOT TO UNLOAD THAT TRUCK
AND GET DOWN TO SAN DIEGO.

12:30.818 --> 12:34.021
- OR YOU COULD
TAKE A TIP FROM LOGAN,

12:34.021 --> 12:35.622
STAY A LITTLE LONGER.

12:35.622 --> 12:36.857
- SAN DIEGO CAN WAIT.

12:36.857 --> 12:39.159
- MM-HMM.

12:39.159 --> 12:40.593
- PLEASE TELL ME
THAT EVERYBODY ELSE

12:40.593 --> 12:42.562
IS BEING RESPONSIBLE
WITH THEIR MONEY.

12:52.940 --> 12:54.274
- WE HAVE A 9:00 A.M. SHOWER

12:54.274 --> 12:56.676
FOLLOWED BY CARTOON WATCHING
FROM 9:30 TO 11:00,

12:56.676 --> 12:58.711

12:58.711 --> 13:01.414
THEN YOUR NOON RECORDING SESSION
WITH GUSTAVO.

13:04.952 --> 13:06.854
BUSY BOY.

13:06.854 --> 13:08.321
- OH, GREAT.

13:08.321 --> 13:10.757
NOW OUR ONLY HOPE TO PROVE THAT
WE'RE RESPONSIBLE WITH OUR MONEY

13:10.757 --> 13:13.293
IS JAMES.

13:13.293 --> 13:16.196
PLEASE TELL ME
YOU DIDN'T BUY A MAGIC CARPET.

13:16.196 --> 13:18.665
- DO I LOOKLIKE AN IDIOT?

13:18.665 --> 13:20.067
- THE ANIMAL CONTROL GUY

13:20.067 --> 13:22.669
WANTED $2,500 TO TAKE APART
THE PALMWOODS VENT SYSTEM

13:22.669 --> 13:24.337
TO FIND HIS SNAKE.

13:24.337 --> 13:28.942
- BUT THIS SNAKE-CHARMING OUTFIT
AND FLUTE WAS ONLY 500 BUCKS.

13:28.942 --> 13:32.012
NOW WHO'S
IRRESPONSIBLE WITH MONEY?

13:37.117 --> 13:40.053
YOU WILL BE MINE!

13:43.456 --> 13:44.691
- WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?

13:44.691 --> 13:46.626
WE ARE MEETING
GRIFFIN AT 5:00

13:46.626 --> 13:49.362
TO PROVE WE DID NOT WASTE OUR
BONUSES ON--I DON'T KNOW--

13:49.362 --> 13:51.899
SAY, A TRUCKLOAD OF ORANGES!

13:55.435 --> 13:56.736
- I THINK I MIGHT KNOW A WAY

13:56.736 --> 13:59.172
WE CAN STILL SQUEEZE
SOME PROFITS OUT OF THIS.

13:59.172 --> 14:00.473
- OKAY, WHAT IS IT?

14:00.473 --> 14:02.910
- IT'S A VERY JUICY PLAN

14:02.910 --> 14:05.979
TO GET EVERY "DROP"
OF YOUR MONEY BACK.

14:05.979 --> 14:07.547

16:15.575 --> 16:19.879
WE HAVE MADE...

16:19.879 --> 16:20.880
ONE GLASS?

16:20.880 --> 16:22.882
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

16:22.882 --> 16:25.285
- THIS MAY HAVE BEEN
A TERRIBLE IDEA,

16:25.285 --> 16:27.187
BUT I KNOW
WHAT'LL CHEER YOU UP.

16:27.187 --> 16:29.622
- WHAT?

16:29.622 --> 16:31.324
OKAY, THAT IS ALWAYS FUNNY.

16:34.761 --> 16:36.196
- HEY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

16:36.196 --> 16:38.065
I THOUGHT GUSTAVO
WAS CHASING YOU AROUND.

16:38.065 --> 16:39.466
- HE WAS.

16:39.466 --> 16:42.435
BUT THEN I GOT TIRED, SO MY
ASSISTANT IS RUNNING FOR ME.

16:42.435 --> 16:46.206
- [screaming]

16:46.206 --> 16:49.176
- WE ARE SO RESPONSIBLE
WITH OUR MONEY.

16:49.176 --> 16:51.378
- [screaming]

16:53.213 --> 16:54.481
- ONE HOUR.

16:54.481 --> 16:56.216
WE HAVE ONE HOUR
TO PROVE TO GRIFFIN

16:56.216 --> 16:58.385
THAT WE ARE
RESPONSIBLE WITH MONEY.

16:58.385 --> 17:00.387
- WITH A BALL PIT?

17:00.387 --> 17:01.921
- IT'S THE WORLD'S
HEALTHIEST BALL PIT,

17:01.921 --> 17:06.159
FILLED WITH VITAMIN C
AND VITAMIN F, FOR FUN.

17:06.159 --> 17:09.529
NOW, ALL I NEED IS 500 KIDS,
AND, BOOM, I WIN.

17:09.529 --> 17:11.464
- SO IS THIS THING ANY FUN?

17:11.464 --> 17:13.100
- FUN?

17:13.100 --> 17:14.634
[laughs]
SERIOUSLY?

17:14.634 --> 17:16.369
THIS THING IS FULL OF FUN.

17:16.369 --> 17:17.704
WATCH THIS.

17:21.341 --> 17:24.177
- SO UH, IS THAT
VITAMIN F KICKING IN?

17:24.177 --> 17:25.945
- KATIE!

17:25.945 --> 17:27.547
- AND THAT'S WHEN I SAID,

17:27.547 --> 17:29.449
"THAT'S JUST
THE TIP OF THE ICEBERG."

17:29.449 --> 17:30.750
[all laughing]

17:30.750 --> 17:33.420
I KNOW, I KNOW, I KNOW.

17:33.420 --> 17:37.124
- OKAY, DON'T YOU THINK THIS
TIPPING THING HAS GONE TOO FAR?

17:37.124 --> 17:39.192
'CAUSE NOW
YOU ARE TIPPING PEOPLE

17:39.192 --> 17:40.760
FOR LAUGHING AT YOUR JOKES.

17:40.760 --> 17:42.329
- OH, THAT IS RIDICULOUS.

17:42.329 --> 17:44.631
EVERYBODY
JUST LOVES A GOOD TIPPER.

17:44.631 --> 17:46.966
- UH, YEAH,
UNTIL YOU RUN OUT OF MONEY.

17:46.966 --> 17:48.268
- WON'T HAPPEN,

17:48.268 --> 17:50.670
'CAUSE WHEN GRIFFIN SEES
HOW RESPONSIBLE WE ARE

17:50.670 --> 17:52.772
WITH OUR MONEY,
I'LL GET EVEN MORE;

17:52.772 --> 17:56.042
MORE MONEY, MORE FRIENDS,
AND MORE TOWELS.

17:56.042 --> 17:57.577
HUH.
THAT'S WEIRD.

17:57.577 --> 17:58.578
OUT OF MONEY.

17:58.578 --> 17:59.779
OUT OF MONEY?

17:59.779 --> 18:01.148
AH.

18:01.148 --> 18:02.382
HEY!

18:02.382 --> 18:03.550
WHERE'D EVERYBODY GO?

18:06.519 --> 18:07.587
WHAT IS THIS?

18:07.587 --> 18:09.021
- A LITTLE TIP.

18:09.021 --> 18:11.658
NEXT TIME,
LISTEN TO YOUR GIRLFRIEND.

18:20.667 --> 18:23.303
- WELL, I WENT THROUGH
THE WHOLE A/C SYSTEM,

18:23.303 --> 18:25.172
BUT I DIDN'T FIND YOUR SNAKE.

18:25.172 --> 18:26.573
BUT THE GOOD NEWS IS,

18:26.573 --> 18:28.575
I STILL GET MY FEE.

18:28.575 --> 18:31.178
- $2,500 AND NO SNAKE?

18:31.178 --> 18:33.246
- OH, I GUESS
THAT'S JUST GOOD NEWS FOR ME.

18:33.246 --> 18:34.947
- BUT THAT'S ALL I HAVE LEFT.

18:34.947 --> 18:36.516
- THEN I GUESS
I'M NOT GETTING A TIP.

18:36.516 --> 18:38.017
- [whimpers]

18:43.723 --> 18:47.594
WELL, I HAVE, UH, NO SNAKE,
NO GIRL, AND NO MONEY.

18:47.594 --> 18:49.629
TELL ME THAT YOU HAVE SOMETHING
TO CHEER ME UP.

18:52.465 --> 18:54.301
LET'S JUST HOPE THAT
LOGAN HAS SOME MONEY LEFT.

19:02.108 --> 19:03.042
- ARE YOU SERIOUS?

19:05.645 --> 19:09.115
- OOH, WHY THE SAD FACES,
BONUS BUDDIES?

19:09.115 --> 19:11.618
- WELL, IN 45 MINUTES,
WE GET TO TELL GRIFFIN

19:11.618 --> 19:14.521
THAT JAMES IS SNAKE-RUPT,
LOGAN HAS $1 LEFT,

19:14.521 --> 19:16.122
AND I HAVE
A TRUCKLOAD OF ORANGES.

19:16.122 --> 19:18.591
- PROBLEMS ARE NO PROBLEM

19:18.591 --> 19:20.126
WHEN YOU'VE GOT
A SUPER ASSISTANT

19:20.126 --> 19:21.794
WHO CAN DO ANYTHING.

19:21.794 --> 19:23.095
ASSISTANT?

19:23.095 --> 19:26.065
- ACTUALLY, I DO KNOW A WAY YOU
CAN MAKE A TON OF MONEY

19:26.065 --> 19:27.567
WITH A TRUCKLOAD OF ORANGES.

19:27.567 --> 19:28.968
all: HOW?

19:28.968 --> 19:30.102
- IT'S SIMPLE.

19:30.102 --> 19:31.238
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS--

19:31.238 --> 19:32.305
[phone chimes]

19:32.305 --> 19:34.106
AND CARLOS
IS OFFICIALLY OUT OF MONEY,

19:34.106 --> 19:37.844
WHICH MEANS
I NO LONGER WORK FOR HIM.

19:37.844 --> 19:38.845
- WAIT.
WHAT?

19:38.845 --> 19:40.580
HOW CAN I BE OUT OF MONEY?

19:40.580 --> 19:43.583
- WELL, YOU PAY ME $100 AN HOUR.

19:43.583 --> 19:46.986
ADD IN ADDITIONAL GROOMING FEES,
HAZARD PAY, OVERTIME,

19:46.986 --> 19:49.121
AND THE 12 LOBSTERS
FOR THE LOBSTER CHARIOT

19:49.121 --> 19:50.757
YOU MADE ME BUILD
AND NEVER USED,

19:50.757 --> 19:53.593
YOUR $5,000
IS OFFICIALLY SPENT.

19:53.593 --> 19:54.761
- [gasps]

20:00.767 --> 20:01.768
- LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT.

20:01.768 --> 20:04.136
- WE WERE GIVEN $20,000,

20:04.136 --> 20:07.507
AND AFTER ONE DAY,
WE HAVE $1 LEFT.

20:07.507 --> 20:09.108
- WHAT DO WE DO?

20:09.108 --> 20:11.911
- WE DO WHAT GRIFFIN WOULD DO.

20:11.911 --> 20:13.580
WE INVEST IT.

20:20.387 --> 20:22.021
all: TO FAILURE!

20:23.856 --> 20:25.925
- OH, FOR--
- UNBELIEVABLE.

20:25.925 --> 20:27.059
- FITTING.
- NOT MY BEST MOVE.

20:29.128 --> 20:31.864
- MY SNAKE!

20:31.864 --> 20:35.335
GORDON BARTHOLOMEW SLITHERTON,
YOU HAD ME WORRIED SICK.

20:35.335 --> 20:38.170
I WILL NEVER
LET GO OF YOU AGAIN.

20:38.170 --> 20:41.240
- HEY, I'LL TAKE THAT SNAKE
OFF OF YOUR HANDS FOR 100 BUCKS.

20:41.240 --> 20:42.375

20:42.375 --> 20:46.413
- OH, AND I'LL TAKE THAT
BECAUSE...

20:50.417 --> 20:54.854
I CAN HIRE MY SUPER ASSISTANT
FOR ONE MORE HOUR.

20:54.854 --> 20:57.690
- NOW, HOW DO WE MAKE A
TON O' MONEY WITH THE ORANGES?

20:57.690 --> 20:59.926
- WE SELL THEM
TO ONE OF MY OLD BOSSES.

20:59.926 --> 21:02.462
HE THINKS BATHING IN
FRESHLY SQUEEZED ORANGE JUICE

21:02.462 --> 21:04.697
ONCE A DAY
KEEPS THE GOBLINS AWAY.

21:04.697 --> 21:06.198
- OOH.

21:06.198 --> 21:07.800
WELL, HOW MUCH MONEY DO YOU
THINK WE CAN GET FOR THEM?

21:11.037 --> 21:14.441
- $20,000.
I'M PROUD OF YOU FELLAS.

21:14.441 --> 21:16.343
YOU DIDN'T WASTE
$1 OF YOUR BONUSES,

21:16.343 --> 21:18.411
AND YOU PROVED ME WRONG,

21:18.411 --> 21:20.813
WHICH IS WEIRD
BECAUSE I'M NEVER WRONG.

21:20.813 --> 21:23.215
IT'S REALLY WEIRD.

21:23.215 --> 21:26.853
- WELL, I GUESS THAT MEANS THAT
THE "R" IN BTR STANDS FOR...

21:26.853 --> 21:28.388
all: "RESPONSIBLE."

21:28.388 --> 21:30.657
- AND SINCE YOU PROVED
YOU CAN BE RESPONSIBLE

21:30.657 --> 21:32.158
WITH YOUR MONEY...

21:32.158 --> 21:34.861
- YOU GET FULL ACCESS
TO YOUR ACCOUNTS.

21:36.128 --> 21:38.365
- NO, WE'RE GOOD.
- YOU KNOW WHAT?

21:38.365 --> 21:40.967
- WE'RE COOL WITH IT.

ON A TRUCKLOAD OF ORANGES.

21:49.275 --> 21:50.810
