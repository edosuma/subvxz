bringing in angel investors,

when we moved onto the ranch.

12:09.689 --> 12:11.482

the stable house last year.

He redid the plumbing,

if I had done anything,

1:04:36.965 --> 1:04:39.241
or if it's because I'm sad--

1:04:39.310 --> 1:04:42.724
- No, no, no, please don't ever
think like that, Mom.

1:04:42.793 --> 1:04:44.206
It wasn't you.

1:04:44.275 --> 1:04:46.137
I'm so sorry that it took me
so long to come home.

1:04:46.206 --> 1:04:47.965
It just always felt...

1:04:48.034 --> 1:04:51.896
heavier than the alternative,
you know?

1:04:51.965 --> 1:04:53.827
Being back,

1:04:53.896 --> 1:04:57.413
I--I just see Dad
wherever I look.

1:05:00.275 --> 1:05:02.000
I just really still miss him,
you know?

1:05:02.068 --> 1:05:05.758
- Yeah.
I get that, sweetheart.

1:05:05.827 --> 1:05:08.689
He was one of a kind.

1:05:08.758 --> 1:05:10.275
I don't think we ever
get over the loss

1:05:10.344 --> 1:05:11.931
of someone that we love.

1:05:12.000 --> 1:05:15.172
I just think we have
to learn to...

1:05:15.241 --> 1:05:18.724
lean a little harder on
the ones that are still here.

1:05:18.793 --> 1:05:21.965
- Yeah, you're right.

1:05:24.172 --> 1:05:26.413
- [sighs]
I love you.

1:05:26.482 --> 1:05:28.413
- I love you too, Mom.

1:05:28.482 --> 1:05:30.172
- [chuckles]

1:05:30.241 --> 1:05:32.310
- And hey, I will never
do that to you again, okay?

1:05:32.379 --> 1:05:34.206
I promise.

1:05:34.275 --> 1:05:37.172
- Okay.

1:05:42.758 --> 1:05:45.793

1:05:48.275 --> 1:05:52.586
- Hey, Blake, do you wanna
grab something to eat?

1:05:52.655 --> 1:05:55.068
- Yeah, sure.

1:06:00.275 --> 1:06:03.689
[indistinct chatter]
- Ooh, yeah, I do, yeah.

1:06:03.758 --> 1:06:06.344
- Well, it's not exactly the
cheap champagne that you like,

1:06:06.413 --> 1:06:09.310
but we do have a copy
of "It's a Wonderful Life."

1:06:09.379 --> 1:06:13.068
- Whoo!
[laughs]

1:06:13.137 --> 1:06:14.965
- Cheers.
Cheers, cheers, cheers.

1:06:15.034 --> 1:06:16.965
- Aw.
- Mmm.

1:06:17.034 --> 1:06:20.413
- Mmm.
Hmm, not bad.

1:06:20.482 --> 1:06:23.482
- This bison chili
is just amazing, Deb.

1:06:23.551 --> 1:06:26.827
I'm telling you really...
- Oh, thank you.

1:06:26.896 --> 1:06:29.068
But I didn't make it.
Wyatt did.

1:06:29.137 --> 1:06:31.413
It's his father's recipe.
- What?

1:06:31.482 --> 1:06:35.620
- See, I can do some
Christmas magic of my own.

1:06:35.689 --> 1:06:37.827
- So, um,

1:06:37.896 --> 1:06:41.241
what is everybody's
Christmas wish?

1:06:41.310 --> 1:06:43.413
Blake, you go.
- Me?

1:06:43.482 --> 1:06:46.931
Okay, well,

1:06:47.000 --> 1:06:49.448
good news on Sam's sabbatical
from Doctors Without Borders

1:06:49.517 --> 1:06:51.068
would be really nice.
- Mm-hmm.

1:06:51.137 --> 1:06:52.689
- You know, this was the year
we were supposed

1:06:52.758 --> 1:06:53.862
to start trying for a baby,

1:06:53.931 --> 1:06:55.517
and it's already
the end of the year,

1:06:55.586 --> 1:06:58.172
and I don't know when
he's gonna be home next, so...

1:06:58.241 --> 1:07:01.034
- Well, we are just
gonna have to remind Santa

1:07:01.103 --> 1:07:03.000
to make a quick pit stop
at the medical center

1:07:03.068 --> 1:07:04.241
down on the Capes.

1:07:04.310 --> 1:07:07.551
- Thanks.
You go, Deb.

1:07:07.620 --> 1:07:10.137
- Well, I already got
my Christmas wish.

1:07:10.206 --> 1:07:11.827
Wyatt's home.
- Aw.

1:07:11.896 --> 1:07:13.586
[laughter]

1:07:16.793 --> 1:07:19.827
- And you, Wyatt?
- Oh, well, that's tough.

1:07:19.896 --> 1:07:22.551
It's a tossup between
world peace and a new car.

1:07:22.620 --> 1:07:23.724
- Boo.
- Kidding.

1:07:23.793 --> 1:07:25.034
I'm kidding.
I'm half-kidding.

1:07:25.103 --> 1:07:27.000
I actually really do want
the new Mercedes GT,

1:07:27.068 --> 1:07:30.172
but it's a hybrid,
so y'all can just relax.

1:07:30.241 --> 1:07:33.862
What about you, Mr. Judgmental?

1:07:33.931 --> 1:07:36.034
- Me?
Uh...

1:07:38.448 --> 1:07:42.310
I wish we didn't have
to leave the ranch,

1:07:42.379 --> 1:07:43.758
Snowbelle's home.

1:07:43.827 --> 1:07:45.551
- Hmm.

1:07:45.620 --> 1:07:49.517
- Well, what if you were to...

1:07:49.586 --> 1:07:51.931
board her at a cute little
ranch in Upstate New York?

1:07:52.000 --> 1:07:53.344
You know,
give the East Coast a try?

1:07:53.413 --> 1:07:55.896
You're so good with
your Photoshop and graphics.

1:07:55.965 --> 1:08:00.068
I'm sure I can get you a job
in our marketing department.

1:08:00.137 --> 1:08:03.103
- Are you serious?
- Yeah, I mean, why not?

1:08:03.172 --> 1:08:05.137
I mean, it might
be entry level, but--

1:08:05.206 --> 1:08:08.586
- No, I mean...

1:08:08.655 --> 1:08:11.586
you can't be serious.

1:08:11.655 --> 1:08:13.379
You think I wanna
abandon my horse

1:08:13.448 --> 1:08:16.620
and just come and live
in New York with you?

1:08:16.689 --> 1:08:18.862
Just leave everything
I built here

1:08:18.931 --> 1:08:21.379
in the off chance
that you might,

1:08:21.448 --> 1:08:25.033
or might not, dump me
like all the other guys?

1:08:25.103 --> 1:08:27.344
- I was offering
a possibility.

1:08:27.413 --> 1:08:29.689
- Look,

1:08:29.758 --> 1:08:32.344
you know how much
I hate moving around.

1:08:32.413 --> 1:08:34.724
I already told you that.
- Mm-hmm.

1:08:34.792 --> 1:08:38.792
- And I know that you're used
to focusing on yourself

1:08:38.862 --> 1:08:41.862
before your commitments
to your family,

1:08:41.931 --> 1:08:44.033
your ranch, your mom,

1:08:44.103 --> 1:08:46.689
your friends, your horse,

1:08:46.758 --> 1:08:51.000
but that's just not me,
and that's just not an option.

1:08:52.585 --> 1:08:54.206
- I'm sorry.
[chuckles]

1:08:54.274 --> 1:08:56.827
I guess I'm not perfectly clear
on what your intentions are

1:08:56.896 --> 1:08:58.896
to do here because

1:08:58.965 --> 1:09:01.274
this place isn't gonna be
around much longer,

1:09:01.344 --> 1:09:03.068
and that includes your home,

1:09:03.137 --> 1:09:05.792
and the stable
where your horse lives, so--

1:09:05.862 --> 1:09:07.724
- Yeah, that's thanks to you

1:09:07.792 --> 1:09:10.896
because you cannot think
of anyone but yourself.

1:09:10.965 --> 1:09:13.309
- Okay, guys, can you just--
- No, no, it's fine.

1:09:13.379 --> 1:09:15.068
It's fine, he's fine.
Keep going, Heath.

1:09:15.137 --> 1:09:17.344
You're on a roll making me out
to be the bad guy.

1:09:17.413 --> 1:09:19.103
You know what?
You're right.

1:09:19.172 --> 1:09:21.379
And I'm used to it.
- That's not true, Wyatt.

1:09:21.448 --> 1:09:24.000
- No, it is.
He's right.

1:09:24.068 --> 1:09:27.172
And the truth is, I do care
more about my promotion

1:09:27.241 --> 1:09:29.965
to senior VP than this ranch,
and that is because

1:09:30.033 --> 1:09:31.758
I have worked
for everything that I have

1:09:31.827 --> 1:09:33.792
and I will not apologize
for it.

1:09:33.862 --> 1:09:35.448
And I happen to think
it's a whole lot better

1:09:35.517 --> 1:09:37.103
than just sitting around here
in hibernation

1:09:37.172 --> 1:09:39.792
like the rest of you
just pretending to be happy

1:09:39.862 --> 1:09:41.413
when none of you actually are.

1:09:41.482 --> 1:09:44.033
- All right, that's not fair.
We're doing just fine.

1:09:44.103 --> 1:09:45.620
- Okay, you're not just
waiting around all day

1:09:45.689 --> 1:09:47.309
for Sam to come home?

1:09:47.379 --> 1:09:49.758
And Mom, you can't even admit
that you're in love with Carlos

1:09:49.827 --> 1:09:52.413
no matter how hard
he tries to be with you.

1:09:52.482 --> 1:09:54.482
And yeah.
Sure, whatever.

1:09:54.550 --> 1:09:58.033
I date around a lot,
but look at you, Heath.

1:09:58.103 --> 1:10:00.344
You're not even awake enough
to put yourself out there

1:10:00.413 --> 1:10:02.620
to take a chance on someone.

1:10:02.689 --> 1:10:04.655
You'd rather just hide out here
with the horses

1:10:04.724 --> 1:10:06.655
where it's safe.

1:10:06.724 --> 1:10:09.862
It's sad.

1:10:14.585 --> 1:10:17.482
Yeah, well,

1:10:17.550 --> 1:10:20.344
you are right about one thing.

1:10:20.413 --> 1:10:23.758
I was ready
to take a chance.

1:10:26.000 --> 1:10:28.206
That was a mistake.

1:10:28.274 --> 1:10:31.379
Excuse me.
Sorry.

- [sniffling]

1:10:40.309 --> 1:10:43.274
I'm sorry, Mom.
That was out of line.

1:10:43.344 --> 1:10:46.792
- Yeah.
[sighs]

1:10:46.862 --> 1:10:49.792
Sweetheart,
I know you didn't mean it

1:10:49.862 --> 1:10:53.482
and I know that all of this

1:10:53.550 --> 1:10:55.896
has been a lot of stress
on you too.

1:10:55.965 --> 1:10:57.344
- I'm sorry, Blake.

1:10:59.827 --> 1:11:02.827
- Don't apologize to me, Wy.

1:11:02.896 --> 1:11:04.274
Go to him.

- [stammers, sighs]
No.

1:11:06.689 --> 1:11:08.413
I--I have to go.
I--

1:11:08.482 --> 1:11:11.585
- Wyatt.
- I can't be here anymore.

1:11:11.655 --> 1:11:13.862
- [groans]
Oh, God.

1:11:15.758 --> 1:11:18.274
Well, that did not go
as planned.

- [sighs]

1:11:27.896 --> 1:11:29.689
- Hey.

1:11:29.758 --> 1:11:32.413
Wyatt, it's almost Christmas.

1:11:32.482 --> 1:11:33.655
I know you're hurt,

1:11:33.724 --> 1:11:36.862
but can't you stay
until after the holiday?

1:11:36.931 --> 1:11:40.172
- Yeah, I gotta get back
and get this whole proposal

1:11:40.241 --> 1:11:42.655
wrapped up
before the new year, so--

1:11:42.724 --> 1:11:44.137
- What about Heath?

1:11:44.206 --> 1:11:45.550
If you go,
it's gonna break his heart.

1:11:45.620 --> 1:11:48.448
- Isn't that exactly
what he set me up to do?

1:11:48.517 --> 1:11:51.550
To disappoint him?

1:11:51.620 --> 1:11:54.517
Anyway, he doesn't wanna
leave his home

1:11:54.585 --> 1:11:56.689
and I gotta stop pretending
that this is still mine,

1:11:56.758 --> 1:11:59.517
so it's done.

1:11:59.585 --> 1:12:01.448
- Hey.

1:12:03.448 --> 1:12:05.758
I'm gonna miss you, Sugar Cube.

1:12:05.827 --> 1:12:08.275

You too, Snow Pea.

1:25:47.793 --> 1:25:50.758
Until you did.

1:25:50.827 --> 1:25:52.585
- And what is this about
you buying the ranch

1:25:52.655 --> 1:25:54.517
instead of your investor?

1:25:54.585 --> 1:25:57.517
- It now belongs to me
and one other investor.

1:25:57.585 --> 1:26:00.000
We're gonna split the farm
between Carlos' property

1:26:00.068 --> 1:26:03.758
and our south side,
so the horse land won't suffer.

1:26:03.827 --> 1:26:05.206
Well, a few acres
for sustainability,

1:26:05.275 --> 1:26:07.550
but the majority will remain--

1:26:07.620 --> 1:26:11.034
horses, stables, everything.

1:26:11.103 --> 1:26:12.931
- I'm still not moving
to Manhattan.

1:26:13.000 --> 1:26:15.758
- Good, that's a relief because
the way things are headed,

1:26:15.827 --> 1:26:18.379
Mom's gonna be retired
and married in no time

1:26:18.448 --> 1:26:20.517
and someone needs
to run this ranch,

1:26:20.585 --> 1:26:23.206
the horseback riding lessons,
and--oh.

1:26:23.275 --> 1:26:25.896
Once we turn the carriage ride
into an affair

1:26:25.965 --> 1:26:28.655
for all seasons,
well, I was hoping

1:26:28.724 --> 1:26:31.724
that maybe you would
consider a promotion.

1:26:31.793 --> 1:26:34.344
To partner.

1:26:34.413 --> 1:26:37.172
- [scoffs]
Partner?

1:26:37.241 --> 1:26:41.550
- Well, the lots of little
ideas was kind of your idea.

1:26:41.620 --> 1:26:43.758
- I don't think it's a
good idea for me to stay here.

1:26:43.827 --> 1:26:45.482
What, with our history,

1:26:45.550 --> 1:26:46.931
we shouldn't be
working together,

1:26:47.000 --> 1:26:49.620
even if you are out there.

1:26:49.689 --> 1:26:52.758
- That's a good point.

1:26:52.827 --> 1:26:56.550
What if I were here?

1:26:56.620 --> 1:26:59.448
- Why would you be here?

1:26:59.517 --> 1:27:01.689
- Well,
we're expanding out west

1:27:01.758 --> 1:27:04.413
and as the newly appointed
senior VP,

1:27:04.482 --> 1:27:06.620
I should probably spearhead
that venture.

1:27:06.689 --> 1:27:09.103
Not to mention, I need to find
my boss a new property.

1:27:09.172 --> 1:27:10.344
He's not too thrilled

1:27:10.413 --> 1:27:12.585
about me stealing this one
from his buyers,

1:27:12.655 --> 1:27:14.103
but most importantly,

1:27:14.172 --> 1:27:17.172
I would really like
to take you out on a date.

1:27:17.241 --> 1:27:19.068
A real one this time.

1:27:19.137 --> 1:27:23.241
We can go horseback riding.
A little dancing.

1:27:23.309 --> 1:27:26.550
Wherever you wanna go, I'm in.

1:27:26.620 --> 1:27:28.103
- Good.

1:27:28.172 --> 1:27:31.172
'Cause you still owe me
that projector movie night.

1:27:31.241 --> 1:27:34.034
Just don't screw it up
this time.

1:27:34.103 --> 1:27:36.655
- I won't.

1:27:36.724 --> 1:27:38.827
You got plans tonight?

1:27:50.379 --> 1:27:53.482
Your heart's beating fast.
- That's on you.

1:28:07.550 --> 1:28:09.068
[clicks tongue]

1:28:19.448 --> 1:28:22.448
[birds chirping]
