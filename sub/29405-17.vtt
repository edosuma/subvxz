WEBVTT

00:02.745 --> 00:04.793
I can't believe you woke me up

00:04.796 --> 00:06.362
at the crack of dawn for this.

00:06.365 --> 00:09.491
We're in the middle of nowhere.

00:09.493 --> 00:12.419
- It's an adventure.
- It's a consolation prize.

00:12.422 --> 00:13.852
You and Dad are getting a divorce

00:13.855 --> 00:17.315
and this is your way of
trying to make me feel better.

00:17.318 --> 00:19.426
Just get out of the car.

00:19.428 --> 00:21.044
This is a chance for us

00:21.046 --> 00:22.713
to do something new together.

00:22.715 --> 00:24.516
Just you and me.

00:24.519 --> 00:25.933
Yeah, 'cause that's how it's gonna be

00:25.935 --> 00:27.217
from now on, right?

00:27.219 --> 00:29.386
Just you and me.

00:29.388 --> 00:32.365
Hey, I know this is hard for you,

00:32.366 --> 00:34.942
but it's not exactly easy for me either.

00:34.945 --> 00:37.085
Your father and I tried hard
for a really long time...

00:37.088 --> 00:38.871
We used to be a family.

00:38.873 --> 00:41.189
You and Dad used to not fight.

00:41.191 --> 00:42.733
You just forgot, that's all.

00:42.735 --> 00:44.355
- Sophie...
- Yeah, I know.

00:44.358 --> 00:45.527
I'm a kid.

00:45.529 --> 00:47.245
I don't have any power.

00:47.248 --> 00:49.790
You and Dad get to
make all the decisions,

00:49.792 --> 00:51.458
but stop expecting me to pretend

00:51.460 --> 00:52.793
like I'm okay with them.

00:52.795 --> 00:54.036
Fair enough.

00:54.038 --> 00:56.297
Let's go take a hot air balloon ride.

00:59.376 --> 01:01.183
Are you sure about going up in this?

01:01.186 --> 01:02.544
It seems really foggy.

01:02.546 --> 01:04.897
Yeah, it's just a marine
layer. It'll burn off.

01:28.423 --> 01:30.447
It's magical.

01:30.449 --> 01:31.948
It's not magic, Mom.

01:31.950 --> 01:34.335
It's hot air. That's what makes it fly.

01:34.337 --> 01:36.766
Actually, it doesn't fly. It floats.

01:36.769 --> 01:40.007
Like a cloud, over the entire world.

01:48.276 --> 01:50.425
Ooh.

01:50.427 --> 01:52.945
That definitely doesn't
feel like floating.

01:55.099 --> 01:57.224
The winds are kicking up.

01:57.226 --> 01:58.975
Whoa, whoa!

01:58.977 --> 02:02.270
Forecast said they were gonna hit later.

02:02.272 --> 02:03.814
Gabe, this is Nick.

02:03.816 --> 02:05.033
Go ahead, Nick.

02:05.035 --> 02:06.341
Winds are pushing hard.

02:06.344 --> 02:09.628
We're gonna have to set
her down past Decker Road.

02:09.631 --> 02:11.130
Copy that.

02:11.132 --> 02:13.799
Whoo! Seems pretty fast.

02:13.801 --> 02:15.307
Yeah, there's gonna be a little bounce.

02:15.309 --> 02:16.365
Hang on.

02:25.888 --> 02:27.721
- Gonna feel the bounce.
- Whoa!

02:27.723 --> 02:29.172
Hang on.

02:29.174 --> 02:30.317
It's gonna be rough.

02:30.320 --> 02:31.651
I don't like this.

02:38.291 --> 02:40.067
- Oh, thank God.
- Everyone okay?

02:40.069 --> 02:41.306
- Yeah.
- Let's go, right?

02:41.308 --> 02:42.200
- Okay.
- You think so?

02:42.203 --> 02:43.781
Okay, I just need to
get out of this thing.

02:43.783 --> 02:46.159
Okay, let me get out
for a sec and help you.

02:46.162 --> 02:48.408
Mom! Mom! Mom!

02:48.411 --> 02:50.169
Sophie! Oh, my God!

02:50.171 --> 02:52.246
Oh, my God, what are
you... bring it down!

02:54.867 --> 02:57.760
Oh, God.

02:58.887 --> 03:00.555
_

03:00.764 --> 03:04.457
_

03:04.460 --> 03:06.109
What's your location, ma'am?

03:06.112 --> 03:08.211
I don't know. I'm in
the middle of nowhere.

03:08.213 --> 03:11.047
She's flying away!

03:11.049 --> 03:13.341
Did you say flying?

03:17.865 --> 03:19.365
It all looks so romantic

03:19.367 --> 03:23.185
till someone has to call 9-1-1.

03:23.187 --> 03:26.021
I heard dispatch gets a lot
of calls from these things.

03:26.023 --> 03:28.732
Maddie tell you that?

03:28.734 --> 03:30.951
Uh, no. Someone else.

03:34.740 --> 03:36.406
Oh, my God. Please, please help.

03:36.408 --> 03:37.832
How old is your daughter, ma'am?

03:37.835 --> 03:38.688
She's 10.

03:38.691 --> 03:39.616
She have a phone with her?

03:39.618 --> 03:41.290
No. I thought she was too young.

03:41.293 --> 03:42.777
Look, there's a radio up in the basket.

03:42.779 --> 03:44.203
That's how Nick and I communicate.

03:44.206 --> 03:45.971
- Mine's in the truck.
- Okay, go get it.

03:45.974 --> 03:47.541
Sir, try not to move.

03:47.550 --> 03:49.073
You got blunt force head injury.

03:49.076 --> 03:50.289
He's in and out of consciousness.

03:50.291 --> 03:51.600
Pupils are equal and reactive.

03:51.603 --> 03:53.565
Let's get him on a
backboard to transport.

03:53.568 --> 03:54.588
The girl.

03:54.591 --> 03:56.008
We are working on that right now.

03:56.017 --> 03:57.618
Cap, they issued a wind advisory

03:57.621 --> 04:00.470
for this area, possible
40 mile an hour gusts.

04:00.473 --> 04:03.116
Those ropes don't look like
they reach more than 30 feet.

04:03.119 --> 04:04.226
She needs to get lower.

04:04.228 --> 04:05.376
You know how to land one of these?

04:05.378 --> 04:06.412
- Yeah.
- Good.

04:06.414 --> 04:07.771
I need you to teach her.

04:11.753 --> 04:14.736
Okay, we should be in
range. Give 'er a try.

04:14.738 --> 04:16.997
Sophie, can you hear me?

04:16.999 --> 04:18.906
Please answer.

04:18.909 --> 04:20.426
Can you hear me?

04:24.081 --> 04:26.587
Mom? Where are you?

04:26.590 --> 04:29.414
Baby, I'm right behind you.

04:29.417 --> 04:31.962
We're in a fire truck
and we're following you.

04:31.964 --> 04:33.964
It won't stop. It's flying faster.

04:33.966 --> 04:35.516
Tell her about the ropes.

04:35.518 --> 04:37.464
Baby, there are ropes above you.

04:37.467 --> 04:39.623
You can use them to
steer. Do you see them?

04:39.626 --> 04:41.493
- I see them, but I can't...
- Sophie.

04:41.496 --> 04:43.948
- I can't.
- Baby, you have to.

04:43.951 --> 04:45.859
I'm scared.

04:45.861 --> 04:47.453
I know. I'm scared too.

04:47.455 --> 04:49.029
Yeah, but you're a grownup.

04:49.031 --> 04:53.149
I'm a kid in a stupid hot air balloon.

04:53.151 --> 04:57.527
I know you feel
powerless, but you're not.

04:57.530 --> 05:01.389
You have all the power right now.

05:01.392 --> 05:03.252
So use it.

05:06.307 --> 05:08.715
Okay, here's what you need to do.

05:08.717 --> 05:11.877
Now use the red and white rope
to let out just a little air.

05:13.630 --> 05:14.629
She's doing it.

05:14.631 --> 05:16.390
It's moving.

05:16.392 --> 05:18.150
She's dropping hard, Cap.

05:18.152 --> 05:20.176
Yeah, we're not gonna
make it before she lands.

05:20.178 --> 05:22.062
Looks like she's headed
for this open field.

05:27.328 --> 05:28.852
Oh, my God, I'm gonna crash!

05:28.854 --> 05:30.478
Honey, you're doing great.

05:30.480 --> 05:32.188
Here she comes! Here she comes!

05:32.190 --> 05:34.316
Mom, tell her to hunker down.

05:34.318 --> 05:35.668
Okay, let's go.

05:37.487 --> 05:39.821
Move, move, move, move.

05:39.823 --> 05:40.914
Grab that far rope!

05:44.369 --> 05:46.369
Dig in your heels, guys!

05:49.499 --> 05:50.790
I got it!

05:56.715 --> 05:58.599
Hey, I got you, I got you, I got you.

06:06.063 --> 06:07.913
Sophie! Oh, my God!

06:07.916 --> 06:09.732
Sophie!

06:09.844 --> 06:11.278
Sophie!

06:11.280 --> 06:13.063
Oh, are you okay?

06:13.065 --> 06:14.373
She's in one piece.

06:14.375 --> 06:16.876
Oh, thank you all so much.

06:16.878 --> 06:19.286
Aw, thank her. She did an amazing job.

06:19.288 --> 06:20.737
Let's go home.

06:24.218 --> 06:25.381
You were right, Mom.

06:25.384 --> 06:28.220
I do have power, so...

06:28.222 --> 06:30.580
I think you and Dad
should go to therapy.

06:36.175 --> 06:39.255

06:43.979 --> 06:45.905
I swear, now that we have two,

06:45.907 --> 06:48.315
bedtime is like a hostage situation.

06:48.317 --> 06:50.517
It's just constant negotiations.

06:50.520 --> 06:51.577
Well, who won?

06:54.582 --> 06:58.083
They did.

06:58.085 --> 07:00.938
Okay, okay, we have got
to cut back on eating out.

07:00.941 --> 07:03.571
We're spending more on
restaurants than groceries.

07:03.573 --> 07:05.424
Wait.

07:05.426 --> 07:08.093
- You went to Shogun without me?
- What?

07:08.095 --> 07:11.171
Well, there's a charge here
for the teppanyaki place.

07:11.173 --> 07:12.212
Who'd you go with?

07:12.215 --> 07:14.958
Oh... Chimney.

07:14.960 --> 07:17.840
You know, never took
him out for his birthday.

07:17.843 --> 07:19.846
And you didn't invite me?

07:19.848 --> 07:21.256
I love teppanyaki.

07:21.258 --> 07:23.133
Babe, you know how it is.

07:23.135 --> 07:26.428
I invite you, so he invites Maddie,

07:26.430 --> 07:28.471
Maddie invites Buck, Buck invites Eddie,

07:28.473 --> 07:30.974
and now we've gotta
invite Athena and Bobby

07:30.976 --> 07:33.694
and next thing you know,
you're looking at a dinner bill

07:33.696 --> 07:35.934
roughly the size of a mortgage payment.

07:35.937 --> 07:37.981
Hmm.

07:37.983 --> 07:41.293
This is a whole new side of
you I haven't seen before.

07:41.295 --> 07:43.278
Frugal.

07:43.280 --> 07:46.873
Sexy.

07:46.875 --> 07:50.469
- Oh, really?
- Mm-hmm.

07:50.471 --> 07:53.762
Well, did I tell you
that I was thinking...

07:53.765 --> 07:55.048
Mmm.

07:55.050 --> 07:59.180
About getting us a Costco membership?

07:59.183 --> 08:02.672
Oh, tell me more.

08:05.302 --> 08:06.968
Mommy!

08:06.970 --> 08:08.395
- Mommy!
- Ugh.

08:08.397 --> 08:10.013
Guess I'm being summoned now.

08:10.015 --> 08:11.657
No, no, no, stay.

08:11.659 --> 08:14.684
Just trying to renegotiate their deal.

08:14.686 --> 08:16.144
I got it.

08:33.347 --> 08:36.423
Who the hell is Imelda?

08:38.019 --> 08:39.589
- Bobby, hey!
- Hey.

08:39.592 --> 08:41.183
I thought Athena was doing the pickup.

08:41.187 --> 08:43.326
Well, she took an extra
shift and I'm subbing in.

08:43.328 --> 08:45.448
- And I'm early.
- Are you hungry?

08:45.451 --> 08:47.011
- We got plenty of food.
- Yeah, yeah.

08:47.012 --> 08:48.769
Come on in.

08:48.771 --> 08:51.530
Athena's been picking up a
lot of overtime lately, huh?

08:51.532 --> 08:54.199
Yeah, lately, I've been feeling
like all our communication

08:54.201 --> 08:57.235
has been through text
messages and Post-It notes.

08:57.238 --> 08:58.717
Ever since she caught this case.

08:58.720 --> 08:59.763
Which case?

09:01.399 --> 09:04.001
The Realtor Rapist.
Mom's on the taskforce.

09:05.237 --> 09:06.712
What? I saw it on the news.

09:06.714 --> 09:08.288
All right, well, let's leave it there

09:08.290 --> 09:10.549
and not bring it to
the dinner table, okay?

09:10.551 --> 09:11.908
Happier subjects please.

09:11.910 --> 09:12.984
Okay.

09:12.987 --> 09:14.553
Let's talk about the
schedule for Saturday.

09:14.555 --> 09:15.745
Prom planning again?

09:15.747 --> 09:16.950
So Mom's gonna take me

09:16.953 --> 09:18.705
to get my hair and makeup done at 12:00,

09:18.708 --> 09:20.486
so we should be done by 3:00...

09:20.489 --> 09:21.706
You're not getting ready at the house?

09:21.708 --> 09:22.581
When did this happen?

09:22.584 --> 09:24.734
It happened after May guilt-tripped Mom

09:24.737 --> 09:27.256
because she didn't go with her
to pick out her stupid dress.

09:27.259 --> 09:28.693
I did not guilt-trip.

09:28.696 --> 09:30.260
I just said it would have been nice

09:30.262 --> 09:31.719
for her to be there when I picked it.

09:31.721 --> 09:34.147
Yeah, you guilt-tripped her.

09:34.149 --> 09:36.075
Darius is coming to pick me up at 4:00.

09:36.077 --> 09:38.493
Dad will have 45 minutes
for pictures, so...

09:38.496 --> 09:39.536
That's it?

09:39.539 --> 09:41.397
We have to go take pictures
at Darius' house too.

09:41.399 --> 09:42.604
Everybody gets 45 minutes.

09:42.607 --> 09:44.107
Don't you think your old man

09:44.109 --> 09:46.234
should have a little extra time?

09:46.236 --> 09:47.944
I mean,

09:47.946 --> 09:51.281
you know, on account of my...

09:51.283 --> 09:52.833
my brain tumor.

09:52.835 --> 09:54.617
Hmm. Yeah, not funny.

09:54.619 --> 09:55.836
- No?
- Mm-mm.

09:55.838 --> 09:59.289
Well, okay. All right.

09:59.291 --> 10:00.560
Fine.

10:00.563 --> 10:02.155
I'll tell Darius to come earlier.

10:02.158 --> 10:03.676
- You get an hour.
- Okay.

10:03.679 --> 10:05.410
- Well played.
- Thank you.

10:05.413 --> 10:07.038
Although I don't think you're gonna get

10:07.041 --> 10:08.558
to play that card much longer.

10:08.561 --> 10:10.257
Your scan is tomorrow, right?

10:10.260 --> 10:11.759
And Dad's gonna crush it.

10:11.761 --> 10:13.385
Hopefully. Okay.

10:13.388 --> 10:14.804
You know, I'm feeling good.

10:14.806 --> 10:18.283
You know, no headaches, no dizziness,

10:18.285 --> 10:20.421
but, you know, I just...

10:20.424 --> 10:22.604
- You don't wanna jinx it.
- Right, right.

10:22.606 --> 10:25.699
You know, the last time,
it was nothing but bad news.

10:25.701 --> 10:29.390
I'm just, you know, preparing
myself for the worst.

10:29.393 --> 10:31.076
I get that.

10:31.079 --> 10:32.895
But the thing about bad news?

10:32.898 --> 10:34.299
You never see it coming.

10:37.562 --> 10:38.898
It's 2020.

10:38.901 --> 10:41.213
How is it possible that
this man just disappeared

10:41.216 --> 10:42.641
into thin air?

10:42.644 --> 10:44.537
No movement on his credit cards.

10:44.540 --> 10:46.644
He hasn't been back to
his house or his office.

10:46.647 --> 10:49.731
Still looking for the
car, but he'll turn up.

10:50.675 --> 10:51.886
And then what?

10:51.889 --> 10:53.597
Even if we find him, we still don't have

10:53.600 --> 10:56.195
any physical evidence that
proves he raped anyone.

10:56.198 --> 10:58.231
No fingerprints, no DNA.

10:58.233 --> 11:02.185
Just videos of a man in a
mask attacking these women.

11:02.187 --> 11:05.497
Still blaming yourself for losing him?

11:05.499 --> 11:07.148
Because you didn't.

11:07.150 --> 11:08.367
I had him, Lou.

11:08.370 --> 11:09.814
Not your fault.

11:09.817 --> 11:11.581
In fact, you're the reason
why he's in hiding right now

11:11.583 --> 11:13.413
instead of targeting his next victim.

11:13.415 --> 11:15.657
As long as he's still out there free,

11:15.659 --> 11:18.752
there's always gonna be a next victim.

11:20.872 --> 11:22.330
Captain's office is set up.

11:22.332 --> 11:24.165
They're bringing the first woman in now.

11:24.167 --> 11:26.092
Yeah. All right, thank you.

11:26.094 --> 11:27.722
- Captain's office?
- Yeah.

11:27.725 --> 11:31.046
Didn't seem right to put 'em
in the interrogation room.

11:39.683 --> 11:41.608
We need a confirmation.

11:41.610 --> 11:45.353
Is that you in the video?

11:45.355 --> 11:46.780
That's me.

11:46.782 --> 11:49.232
But that angle...

11:49.234 --> 11:51.567
He put a camera in the smoke detector.

11:51.569 --> 11:52.744
He knew my house.

11:52.746 --> 11:55.121
How to get in, where to hide,

11:55.123 --> 11:57.740
where to put a camera.

11:57.742 --> 11:59.909
- How?
- He studied you.

11:59.911 --> 12:02.788
He used a drone to stalk his targets.

12:02.791 --> 12:05.873
He learned your
patterns, your movements.

12:05.875 --> 12:08.042
You know, I thought
someone was watching me,

12:08.044 --> 12:10.562
but I dismissed it.

12:10.564 --> 12:12.898
I just moved in,

12:12.900 --> 12:17.143
so I thought I was being paranoid.

12:17.145 --> 12:19.479
What else do you
remember about that night?

12:19.481 --> 12:22.574
Any detail at all might help us.

12:22.576 --> 12:24.451
I remember everything.

12:26.854 --> 12:29.388
I forgot that part.

12:29.391 --> 12:30.932
Would you like a minute?

12:30.935 --> 12:32.956
I just wanna get this over with.

12:32.959 --> 12:35.310
You reported this as a break-in,

12:35.313 --> 12:37.797
not an attack.

12:37.800 --> 12:41.835
I didn't wanna admit it happened.

12:41.837 --> 12:45.455
I guess I thought if I
didn't say it out loud,

12:45.457 --> 12:48.291
I could pretend it didn't.

12:48.293 --> 12:50.352
Turn it off. Please.

12:51.438 --> 12:52.938
I'm sorry.

12:52.940 --> 12:56.924
I'm sure it must be
hard to see yourself.

12:56.926 --> 12:59.736
That's not me anymore, so it's fine.

13:02.116 --> 13:05.308
He stole so much from me that night.

13:05.310 --> 13:08.478
I mean, physical items
I can replace, but...

13:08.480 --> 13:11.647
the pieces of me he took, I'm...

13:11.649 --> 13:15.238
I'm not sure how to replace those.

13:15.241 --> 13:19.743
I'm sorry, I don't recall
any mention of missing items.

13:19.746 --> 13:21.799
My necklace.

13:21.802 --> 13:25.161
I was wearing it when
he attacked me, and...

13:25.163 --> 13:27.327
he took it with him when he left.

13:29.384 --> 13:31.551
Are we done here? I
think I've had enough.

13:31.553 --> 13:32.674
Of course.

13:32.677 --> 13:34.220
We'll have an officer walk you out.

13:37.342 --> 13:40.060
Thank you.

13:40.062 --> 13:42.551
We need to go through those files again.

13:42.554 --> 13:44.731
See if anybody else is
missing personal items.

13:44.733 --> 13:47.492
Yeah, those guys
sometimes take souvenirs.

13:47.494 --> 13:49.477
- Trophies.
- Mm.

13:49.479 --> 13:51.614
You know what I like
to call those souvenirs?

13:51.617 --> 13:53.523
Evidence.

13:53.525 --> 13:56.192
We find that and we can put him away.

13:56.194 --> 13:57.810
For good this time.

14:02.819 --> 14:05.195
Okay, Mr. Grant, I need you to hold

14:05.198 --> 14:07.006
- your breath again.
- Okay.

14:07.009 --> 14:08.991
Another 20 seconds.

14:08.994 --> 14:10.753
Ready?

14:10.756 --> 14:13.423
Ready.

14:13.426 --> 14:16.710
And breathe.

14:16.713 --> 14:18.684
And hold.

14:38.546 --> 14:39.913
And release.

14:43.458 --> 14:47.460
You doing okay, Mr. Grant?

14:47.462 --> 14:49.221
Yeah, I'm fine.

14:49.223 --> 14:50.872
You don't sound fine.

14:50.874 --> 14:52.530
I was sitting in that coffin

14:52.533 --> 14:54.041
for 45 minutes.

14:54.043 --> 14:56.043
The least they could
do is give me a hint

14:56.045 --> 14:57.183
about what went on.

14:57.186 --> 14:58.178
Coffin?

14:58.181 --> 14:59.985
That's a figure of speech, Athena.

14:59.988 --> 15:01.880
Now I have to go
upstairs and give blood.

15:01.883 --> 15:04.309
Michael, you sure you're doing okay?

15:04.312 --> 15:07.572
- Because I can...
- There is nothing to do.

15:07.574 --> 15:10.316
Okay? We just...

15:10.318 --> 15:11.726
Wait.

15:11.728 --> 15:13.670
And hope.

15:13.673 --> 15:15.732
Yeah.

15:15.735 --> 15:17.415
So talk later?

15:17.418 --> 15:19.492
Yeah. Sure.

15:27.093 --> 15:28.399
You found something?

15:28.402 --> 15:29.670
Maybe.

15:29.673 --> 15:30.880
Yeah, I've been going through

15:30.883 --> 15:32.216
his credit card purchases again.

15:32.219 --> 15:33.707
Thought that was a dead end.

15:33.710 --> 15:36.341
Well, at first glance,
yeah, but then I figured,

15:36.344 --> 15:39.086
you know, maybe if I mapped out
the places that he frequented,

15:39.088 --> 15:41.088
we'd get a fuller picture
of his movements, you know?

15:41.090 --> 15:42.182
Figure out where he'd go.

15:42.184 --> 15:43.349
Well, he lives here.

15:43.351 --> 15:44.776
His office is here.

15:44.778 --> 15:47.261
These are his real estate listings.

15:47.263 --> 15:50.431
Now, this seems to be off
the beaten path for him.

15:50.433 --> 15:51.858
- What is it?
- Coffee shop.

15:51.860 --> 15:53.768
I've got seven charges
in the past six months.

15:53.770 --> 15:55.687
I just can't figure
out why he'd go there.

15:55.690 --> 15:58.650
Doesn't overlap with any of our victims.

15:58.653 --> 16:01.987
I don't know, it's odd,
but it's probably nothing.

16:01.990 --> 16:05.629
Yeah, well, nothing seems
to be all we got right now.

16:11.287 --> 16:13.805
No, I-I understand.

16:13.807 --> 16:16.975
I just need to think about
it. Do I have to decide now?

16:16.977 --> 16:19.513
Okay, I'll let you know. Thanks.

16:23.508 --> 16:25.508
Hi.

16:25.510 --> 16:27.351
You okay?

16:27.354 --> 16:29.396
I don't know.

16:29.399 --> 16:31.366
The district attorney's been calling me

16:31.369 --> 16:33.181
about Greg's sentencing hearing.

16:33.184 --> 16:35.568
They want me to make a
victim impact statement.

16:35.570 --> 16:37.513
Yeah, I think we're all
making statements, right?

16:37.516 --> 16:38.853
- They said...
- Letters.

16:38.856 --> 16:40.690
We were all supposed to write letters

16:40.692 --> 16:42.858
about our hostage experience.

16:42.860 --> 16:44.970
But I guess because I
was victimized twice,

16:44.973 --> 16:47.579
they think I should make
a personal statement.

16:47.582 --> 16:49.841
In the courtroom.

16:49.843 --> 16:52.418
So you would have to be
in the same room with Greg.

16:52.420 --> 16:54.704
I really thought this was all over.

16:54.706 --> 16:57.540
That I wouldn't have to see him again.

16:57.542 --> 17:00.042
But talking about what he did to me

17:00.044 --> 17:01.836
while he's sitting there

17:01.838 --> 17:03.379
looking at me?

17:03.382 --> 17:04.608
I don't know if I can do it.

17:04.611 --> 17:06.358
Then don't. Look, he pled guilty.

17:06.359 --> 17:09.153
He's going to prison whether
you're in the courtroom or not.

17:09.156 --> 17:11.053
Yeah.

17:11.055 --> 17:13.085
But not going makes
me feel like a coward.

17:13.088 --> 17:14.954
He's in jail.

17:14.957 --> 17:18.202
But it still feels like he's
the one with all the power.

17:28.031 --> 17:30.698
No, no, no.

17:30.700 --> 17:33.293
What are you doing?

17:33.295 --> 17:34.794
Trimming the trees, ma'am.

17:34.796 --> 17:36.263
You mean murdering them?

17:36.266 --> 17:38.240
If you have a complaint,
you should call the city.

17:38.243 --> 17:39.373
They have the power.

17:39.375 --> 17:40.800
We're just doing our jobs.

17:40.802 --> 17:42.612
With a saw!

17:42.615 --> 17:44.586
That one still hasn't come back

17:44.589 --> 17:46.806
from what you did to it last year.

17:46.809 --> 17:48.270
Tree trimming is an important step

17:48.273 --> 17:49.895
to maintain the beauty, safety,

17:49.898 --> 17:51.322
and health of your neighborhood.

17:51.325 --> 17:53.887
Botanical butchers!

17:53.890 --> 17:56.098
Trees are like show dogs.

17:56.100 --> 18:00.078
Without the right cut, the
entire aesthetic is wrong.

18:00.080 --> 18:01.937
They're not made for crew cuts.

18:01.939 --> 18:03.990
Sorry, lady, but the crew
cuts are what keeps them

18:03.992 --> 18:05.399
from taking down the power lines.

18:14.669 --> 18:16.243
Grab me the other saw.

18:24.587 --> 18:27.513
Whoa! Oh, my...

18:34.430 --> 18:36.406
Who's got the power now?

18:36.824 --> 18:38.117
_

18:38.326 --> 18:39.766
_

18:39.769 --> 18:41.700
Is your captor armed or known to you?

18:41.703 --> 18:42.978
They just stole my truck!

18:42.980 --> 18:43.893
Wait, I'm sorry.

18:43.896 --> 18:45.147
Are you reporting a kidnapping

18:45.149 --> 18:46.174
or a vehicle theft?

18:46.177 --> 18:47.551
Both. I've been truck-jacked.

18:47.554 --> 18:48.461
I'm a tree-trimmer,

18:48.464 --> 18:50.288
and some psycho just jumped
in my truck and took off

18:50.290 --> 18:51.477
when I was in the bucket.

18:51.480 --> 18:53.480
We're headed east on La France and...

18:53.483 --> 18:56.237
- Oh, God.
- Sir, are you still there?

18:56.240 --> 18:57.981
You might want to send an ambulance.

18:57.984 --> 18:59.787
Maybe more than one.

19:08.890 --> 19:10.899
You okay, man?

19:13.010 --> 19:14.560
Ma'am, LAFD. Stay where you are.

19:14.562 --> 19:15.654
Don't try to get out.

19:15.656 --> 19:18.514
Guys, these lines are still hot.

19:18.516 --> 19:21.809
I want you to grab dry
chem and CO2 from the truck.

19:21.811 --> 19:23.662
Dispatch, this is Captain 118.

19:23.664 --> 19:25.738
I am at the intersection
of La France and Maple.

19:25.740 --> 19:28.074
I need DWP to shut down the power here.

19:28.076 --> 19:29.525
Copy that, 118.

19:29.527 --> 19:31.026
DWP estimate ten minutes.

19:31.028 --> 19:32.664
Vehicle is under downed power lines.

19:32.667 --> 19:35.173
See if you can shave some time off that.

19:35.175 --> 19:37.366
- How's he doing?
- No broken bones.

19:37.369 --> 19:39.035
Just a couple of bumps and bruises.

19:39.038 --> 19:41.110
- Maybe a concussion.
- But he fell through the roof.

19:41.112 --> 19:43.204
Cardboard boxes bore
the brunt of the fall.

19:43.207 --> 19:45.332
You know, stunt guys still
use 'em as crash pads.

19:45.334 --> 19:47.260
But aren't those boxes usually empty?

19:53.935 --> 19:56.361
I thought these truck cabs
are supposed to be grounded.

19:56.363 --> 19:57.770
Why does her hair look like that?

19:57.772 --> 19:59.772
High-voltage events can emit

19:59.774 --> 20:01.774
an awful lot of static electricity.

20:01.776 --> 20:04.277
You came for the tree murderers.

20:04.279 --> 20:06.854
Yeah, yeah, I don't think
that's who they're here for.

20:13.880 --> 20:16.881
Hold the elevator?

20:16.883 --> 20:18.791
- Thank you.
- No problem, man.

20:24.040 --> 20:25.724
I can see she's got
subdermal tissue damage

20:25.726 --> 20:26.707
from the strike.

20:26.709 --> 20:28.013
We need to transport her.

20:28.016 --> 20:30.799
Any update on when DWP's
gonna get the power off?

20:35.170 --> 20:36.594
There's your answer.

20:36.597 --> 20:37.809
Let's get her out.

20:37.812 --> 20:40.146
Carefully.

20:40.148 --> 20:42.148
Thanks for the quick work
on the power, Dispatch.

20:42.151 --> 20:43.359
I'd say you're welcome,

20:43.362 --> 20:45.552
but our updates show they're
still four minutes out.

20:45.555 --> 20:48.798
If you didn't shut
the power off, who did?

20:48.801 --> 20:50.248
Seriously?

20:51.993 --> 20:53.400
Seriously?

20:55.947 --> 20:57.255
Seriously?

20:57.257 --> 20:58.447
I'm on it, Cap!

21:01.620 --> 21:03.539
This is gonna be a long day.

21:09.293 --> 21:10.626
Prably an outage.

21:10.628 --> 21:12.103
You know, by law,

21:12.105 --> 21:13.938
the generators are supposed to kick on

21:13.940 --> 21:15.965
in about ten seconds.

21:15.967 --> 21:17.145
I'm an architect.

21:17.148 --> 21:18.610
Backup generators in this building

21:18.612 --> 21:20.636
strictly power level one support systems

21:20.638 --> 21:24.949
where failure will result
in loss of human life.

21:24.951 --> 21:27.128
- I'm a doctor.
- That's great.

21:27.131 --> 21:29.694
Well, if I have a panic attack in here,

21:29.697 --> 21:31.855
at least I'm with a
medical professional.

21:31.858 --> 21:32.750
Oh, I don't know.

21:32.753 --> 21:34.741
It depends on what kind
of insurance you have.

21:34.744 --> 21:36.110
Oh.

21:36.112 --> 21:38.320
Wait, are you prone to panic attacks?

21:38.322 --> 21:40.489
I never had one before today.

21:40.491 --> 21:43.709
But never been trapped
in an elevator either.

21:43.711 --> 21:45.119
Look on the bright side.

21:45.121 --> 21:48.223
There's worse places to be trapped.

21:50.768 --> 21:52.310
_

21:52.311 --> 21:56.816
_

21:56.976 --> 21:58.339
_

21:58.342 --> 21:59.967
An accident caused an outage.

21:59.969 --> 22:01.653
DWP's working on restoring the power.

22:01.655 --> 22:03.345
We recommend that
people shelter in place

22:03.347 --> 22:04.638
until the power's restored.

22:04.641 --> 22:06.065
Oh, I'm not going anywhere.

22:06.067 --> 22:07.325
That's sort of the problem.

22:07.327 --> 22:09.160
I'm trapped inside.

22:09.162 --> 22:11.469
You think you could send
someone to get me out?

22:11.472 --> 22:12.646
It's getting pretty cold.

22:12.648 --> 22:14.481
Where did you say you were?

22:14.483 --> 22:16.345
I'm in the walk-in freezer.

22:18.171 --> 22:20.505
You're stuck inside the freezer?

22:20.507 --> 22:22.197
Yeah.

22:22.199 --> 22:23.749
Okay. What's your name?

22:23.751 --> 22:25.659
Gordon. Gordon Johnson.

22:25.661 --> 22:27.036
Okay, Gordon. I'm Maddie.

22:27.045 --> 22:28.275
There should be some kind

22:28.278 --> 22:30.163
of emergency release
knob inside the freezer.

22:30.166 --> 22:31.182
Have you looked for it?

22:31.184 --> 22:32.494
It's frozen over.

22:32.497 --> 22:33.876
Tried whacking it with a chateaubriand,

22:33.878 --> 22:35.761
but the ice is pretty thick.

22:35.763 --> 22:37.856
Any idea when you can
have someone sent out?

22:37.858 --> 22:39.599
Power's out for half the city.

22:39.601 --> 22:41.025
It might take some time.

22:41.027 --> 22:43.361
Can you tell me how
large the freezer is?

22:43.363 --> 22:46.865
- Probably about 15x30.
- Good.

22:46.867 --> 22:48.608
That's enough cubic feet of oxygen

22:48.610 --> 22:49.442
to last you a few hours.

22:49.444 --> 22:50.776
Hours?

22:50.778 --> 22:52.366
Hours? I can't be in here hours.

22:52.369 --> 22:53.678
No, no, no. Gordon, don't panic.

22:53.681 --> 22:55.540
The faster you breathe,
the more air you'll use,

22:55.542 --> 22:57.110
so you need to slow your breathing.

22:57.113 --> 22:58.153
Okay.

22:58.156 --> 23:00.194
I don't wanna end up another
frozen piece of meat in here.

23:00.196 --> 23:01.621
That's why you need to conserve

23:01.623 --> 23:03.195
as much of your body heat as possible.

23:03.198 --> 23:04.244
How?

23:04.253 --> 23:05.637
Okay, I want you to look around

23:05.640 --> 23:08.263
and tell me everything you
see that isn't frozen meat.

23:10.557 --> 23:11.872
How we doing, Gordon?

23:11.874 --> 23:14.416
Pretty cold.

23:14.418 --> 23:15.885
Tired too.

23:15.888 --> 23:17.637
No, don't fall asleep, Gordon.

23:17.639 --> 23:20.047
I need you to stay awake. Okay?

23:24.070 --> 23:25.644
Gordon?

23:25.687 --> 23:27.112
Gordon?

23:27.148 --> 23:29.482
Gordon?

23:32.436 --> 23:34.245
LAFD. Gordon?

23:34.247 --> 23:36.063
Okay, he's out. Probably hypothermic.

23:36.065 --> 23:37.148
Let's cut him out now.

23:42.071 --> 23:44.497
Saw's dead. Need another battery.

23:44.499 --> 23:46.433
Oh, and that was the last battery pack.

23:46.436 --> 23:48.142
Too many car accidents in one day.

23:48.145 --> 23:49.952
Couldn't we just break open this window?

23:49.954 --> 23:51.003
Even if we could get in that way,

23:51.005 --> 23:52.810
how do we get him out? It's too small.

23:52.813 --> 23:54.674
The unit should have
an electronic emergency

23:54.676 --> 23:56.434
door release and without power...

23:56.436 --> 23:58.794
Inside of that door is a
frozen block of ice by now.

23:58.796 --> 24:01.606
Yeah, well, so's Gordon
if we don't get him out.

24:01.608 --> 24:04.442
Maybe it just needs a jump.

24:23.463 --> 24:24.963
All set here.

24:24.965 --> 24:27.321
Charging.

24:30.985 --> 24:33.454
Clear!

24:33.456 --> 24:35.548
Can you hit it again?

24:38.720 --> 24:40.961
Clear!

24:54.654 --> 24:57.407
Pumping warm fluids.

24:57.410 --> 24:59.187
89.9.

24:59.190 --> 25:01.356
Dispatch, we got to him in time.

25:01.358 --> 25:05.077
Think he's gonna be all right.

25:05.079 --> 25:08.339
I'll give you a call
back once they get us out.

25:08.341 --> 25:09.823
Bye. Love you.

25:11.869 --> 25:13.011
Kids okay?

25:13.013 --> 25:14.995
Yeah. Yeah.

25:14.997 --> 25:17.164
Hmm.

25:17.166 --> 25:20.926
Anyone you need to call?

25:20.928 --> 25:23.596
I texted my office.
They'll handle the rest.

25:23.598 --> 25:27.216
No, I meant, you know, at home...

25:27.218 --> 25:30.102
or something.

25:30.104 --> 25:32.387
Oh, yeah. Oscar.

25:32.389 --> 25:33.847
Oh. Oh, that's...

25:33.849 --> 25:35.759
But he's not expecting me till 7:00.

25:35.762 --> 25:39.138
Oh, okay. Yeah, that's good.

25:39.141 --> 25:41.279
My dog.

25:41.282 --> 25:44.148
Hmm.

25:44.151 --> 25:47.786
I guess he's probably not
good at returning texts.

25:47.789 --> 25:48.954
The worst.

25:48.956 --> 25:49.948
Yeah, I bet.

25:52.701 --> 25:56.462
And to answer the question
behind the question,

25:56.464 --> 26:00.308
no, I don't have anyone
special waiting at home.

26:40.842 --> 26:42.325
Hey, Athena. What's going on?

26:42.328 --> 26:43.584
Hey.

26:43.586 --> 26:44.960
I think I found something.

26:44.962 --> 26:46.646
Studio Self Storage.

26:46.649 --> 26:48.023
Does he have a unit there?

26:48.026 --> 26:50.423
You know, maybe that's where
he's storing his trophies.

26:50.426 --> 26:52.685
It would explain those
coffee shop charges.

26:52.687 --> 26:54.595
I need you to contact the manager.

26:54.597 --> 26:56.280
Nobody's here because of the power.

26:56.282 --> 26:57.782
All right, I'll find out.

26:57.784 --> 26:59.141
This could be the break we need.

26:59.143 --> 27:00.451
I can't say for sure,

27:00.453 --> 27:02.644
but I have a really strong feeling.

27:02.646 --> 27:03.863
Yeah, see you soon.

27:18.321 --> 27:21.948
Dispatch, 727-L-30
at Studio Self Storage

27:21.951 --> 27:23.141
doing a business check.

27:23.143 --> 27:25.459
Copy. 727-L-30.

28:28.065 --> 28:30.250
Dispatch, 727-L-30.

28:30.253 --> 28:32.235
I'm gonna need backup and detectives

28:32.238 --> 28:34.212
dispatched to Studio Self Storage.

28:34.214 --> 28:36.547
I have a possible...

28:40.244 --> 28:43.221
727-L-30, do you copy?

28:43.223 --> 28:45.965
727-L-30, please respond.

28:45.967 --> 28:47.299
Officer needs help.

28:47.301 --> 28:50.273
727-L-30 at Studio Self Storage.

28:50.276 --> 28:52.398
Her mic's still keyed open,
but I can't talk to her.

28:56.736 --> 28:59.117
All units, police, and fire RA,

28:59.120 --> 29:00.220
clear channel two.

29:00.222 --> 29:01.672
Switch to Tac Channel 50.

29:01.675 --> 29:04.309
Officer on open mic in distress.

29:04.312 --> 29:05.684
Needs assistance.

29:05.687 --> 29:08.820
727-L-30 at Studio Self Storage.

29:08.823 --> 29:10.926
Bobby!

29:10.929 --> 29:12.750
Take him to the hospital
and everyone else,

29:12.752 --> 29:13.993
on the engine, now, let's go.

29:30.344 --> 29:34.254
Cap, they're telling
us to switch to Tac 50.

30:40.732 --> 30:42.489
Sir, the building's not clear.

30:57.548 --> 30:59.714
Captain Nash, she's here.

31:04.364 --> 31:07.865
Athena, can you hear me?

31:07.867 --> 31:10.117
Can you hear me? Athena.

31:11.895 --> 31:13.537
Pupils equal and reactive.

31:13.539 --> 31:15.269
Might be a fractured rib.

31:17.451 --> 31:19.430
Arm's definitely broken.
Right closed fracture.

31:19.433 --> 31:21.045
All right. Starting fluids.

31:21.047 --> 31:23.288
Splinting the arm. You
stay with us, Athena.

31:23.290 --> 31:24.865
How's she doing?

31:24.867 --> 31:26.384
I got...

31:26.386 --> 31:28.552
I got him.

31:28.554 --> 31:29.767
Suspect down?

31:29.770 --> 31:31.538
Alive. Wounded.

31:31.540 --> 31:33.600
- Let's get a medic.
- He can wait.

31:35.462 --> 31:37.544
Dispatch, I need additional RAs

31:37.546 --> 31:39.058
to Studio Self Storage.

31:39.061 --> 31:40.422
We need to move her!

31:51.393 --> 31:54.087
Bobby. Bobby.

31:54.090 --> 31:55.770
I'm here. I'm here.

31:55.772 --> 31:58.157
I'm right here.

31:58.159 --> 31:59.900
I'm right here. Stay with us.

31:59.902 --> 32:01.252
Finally.

32:01.254 --> 32:03.232
'Cause I've had enough of this place.

32:03.235 --> 32:04.946
- No offense.
- None taken.

32:04.948 --> 32:05.947
- Thank you.
- Listen...

32:05.949 --> 32:07.091
Oh.

32:07.093 --> 32:09.743
I'm sorry. One second.

32:09.745 --> 32:12.504
Hey, Bobby.

32:12.506 --> 32:14.080
Bobby?

32:17.344 --> 32:18.561
Okay.

32:26.839 --> 32:29.595
But I don't understand.
Prepare ourselves for what?

32:31.192 --> 32:33.308
Listen...

32:33.310 --> 32:35.953
Bobby said your mom
was pretty banged up.

32:35.955 --> 32:37.362
She's gonna be okay, right?

32:37.364 --> 32:38.456
Yes, she will.

32:38.458 --> 32:40.774
But right now, she's hurt,

32:40.776 --> 32:44.819
and we've gotta be strong
to help her through it.

32:44.821 --> 32:47.110
Okay.

32:47.236 --> 32:48.281
Okay.

32:57.334 --> 32:58.783
Oh, hey.

32:58.786 --> 33:01.002
Hey.

33:01.004 --> 33:02.554
Mom, I'm so glad you're all right.

33:02.556 --> 33:04.506
Oh, me too, baby.

33:04.508 --> 33:06.967
Me too.

33:06.969 --> 33:09.469
Harry.

33:09.471 --> 33:11.137
It's okay.

33:11.139 --> 33:12.823
Come here. Give me a hug.

33:12.825 --> 33:14.156
But I don't wanna hurt you.

33:14.159 --> 33:15.487
Oh, you won't.

33:15.490 --> 33:18.519
A hug from my babies
is exactly what I need.

33:21.501 --> 33:23.984
Ooh. Oh, see?

33:23.986 --> 33:26.504
Ooh, I'm feeling better already.

33:29.658 --> 33:31.658
It looks worse than it is.

33:31.660 --> 33:34.419
Good. Then you'll be out of here soon.

33:34.421 --> 33:36.396
She has to stay here for a few days.

33:36.399 --> 33:37.486
I'm gonna stay with her.

33:37.489 --> 33:39.016
Nurse is gonna set
me up with a rollaway.

33:39.018 --> 33:40.200
Oh, it's foolish.

33:40.203 --> 33:41.811
I don't want anyone making a fuss.

33:41.814 --> 33:43.505
- I'm fine.
- No, you're not fine.

33:43.508 --> 33:44.816
I'm staying.

33:47.073 --> 33:48.442
Just please let me do this.

33:50.220 --> 33:52.012
Okay.

33:52.014 --> 33:54.222
It'll be good to have the company.

33:57.114 --> 33:59.063
What else are you hiding?

33:59.066 --> 34:00.895
Hey, Karen, the babysitter's here.

34:00.897 --> 34:02.195
You ready?

34:02.198 --> 34:03.980
Yeah, I'm not really feeling too well,

34:03.983 --> 34:06.525
so it's probably not a good idea

34:06.528 --> 34:08.045
for me to go to the hospital.

34:08.047 --> 34:10.621
Just give Athena my love.

34:13.793 --> 34:14.868
Are you sure?

34:14.870 --> 34:16.844
Yeah, positive.

34:18.042 --> 34:19.389
I hear Athena's gonna be okay.

34:19.391 --> 34:21.081
Yeah, Buck called from the hospital

34:21.083 --> 34:22.467
and said that she's in rough shape,

34:22.469 --> 34:24.043
but nothing life-threatening.

34:24.045 --> 34:26.087
Although I will be
having nightmares about it

34:26.089 --> 34:27.139
for a while.

34:27.141 --> 34:28.590
Yeah, hearing her struggle?

34:28.592 --> 34:30.568
Not being able to help her?

34:30.570 --> 34:33.145
But hey, gives us something
new to talk about in therapy.

34:33.147 --> 34:35.179
Well, that's great.

34:35.181 --> 34:38.224
'Cause I was starting to
think that I was boring Frank.

34:38.226 --> 34:42.413
You know, you could talk
to him about going to court.

34:42.415 --> 34:43.989
You think I should do it.

34:43.991 --> 34:45.290
- Maddie...
- No.

34:45.293 --> 34:47.491
I just think that you
should consider what it means

34:47.494 --> 34:49.235
if you don't do it.

34:49.237 --> 34:52.422
You keep saying that you feel powerless.

34:52.425 --> 34:56.168
Maybe if you face him
and tell him how you feel,

34:56.170 --> 34:58.170
you'll get your power back.

35:06.928 --> 35:08.105
Hey.

35:08.107 --> 35:09.422
Who's Imelda?

35:15.305 --> 35:17.022
What am I looking at here?

35:17.024 --> 35:18.640
Proof that Hen is cheating on me.

35:18.642 --> 35:20.630
What? Hen would never do that.

35:20.633 --> 35:24.646
I mean, not after what happened
the last time she did that.

35:24.648 --> 35:29.109
She's got all these dates
and the name of a hotel.

35:29.111 --> 35:31.486
I mean, is that when
she's planning to meet up

35:31.488 --> 35:33.797
with this Imelda?

35:33.799 --> 35:35.374
You find anything else on her phone?

35:35.376 --> 35:37.542
Nothing. It was locked.

35:37.544 --> 35:39.136
I took a picture of the screen.

35:39.138 --> 35:41.138
Oh, did you use her thumb to unlock it

35:41.140 --> 35:43.382
while she was sleeping?

35:43.384 --> 35:45.809
Ew. No.

35:45.811 --> 35:47.669
Wait, do you do that?

35:47.671 --> 35:49.146
Of course not!

35:49.148 --> 35:51.482
Buck did it to me once
after I got stabbed.

35:51.484 --> 35:53.675
Anyways, look, it's
just two text messages

35:53.677 --> 35:54.893
and a scrap of paper.

35:54.895 --> 35:56.329
It probably means nothing.

35:58.807 --> 36:01.850
There's a charge on our credit card.

36:01.852 --> 36:04.310
A teppanyaki restaurant.

36:04.312 --> 36:07.665
She said she took you
there for your birthday.

36:07.667 --> 36:10.817
Is that true?

36:13.697 --> 36:15.530
I cannot believe she lied about that.

36:15.532 --> 36:16.823
I love teppanyaki.

36:16.825 --> 36:18.491
See? Another lie.

36:18.493 --> 36:19.659
Right to my face.

36:19.662 --> 36:22.921
She's using me to lie to you.

36:22.923 --> 36:25.849
We barely survived the last time.

36:25.851 --> 36:28.427
And now we have two kids to think of.

36:28.429 --> 36:30.670
I really wish I knew
how to help you, Karen.

36:32.933 --> 36:34.549
You got anything to drink?

36:34.551 --> 36:36.509
Yeah. I got coffee.

36:39.246 --> 36:40.680
I'll get us something stronger.

36:40.682 --> 36:41.699
Mm-hmm.

36:51.359 --> 36:53.860
Thank God. I found 'em like this.

36:53.862 --> 36:55.713
I don't think she can drive home.

37:03.038 --> 37:05.371
Karen, I thought you were sick.

37:05.373 --> 37:07.207
I am sick.

37:07.209 --> 37:09.892
I'm sick of the lies.

37:09.895 --> 37:11.419
Lies.

37:11.421 --> 37:12.563
I'm sick of the betrayal.

37:12.565 --> 37:14.246
So much betrayal.

37:14.249 --> 37:16.734
Hey, Chim, maybe we should
give them some privacy.

37:16.736 --> 37:19.552
Why do I have to leave?
This is my apartment.

37:19.554 --> 37:21.313
And Hen is the one who's cheating.

37:21.315 --> 37:22.863
Wha... I'm not cheating.

37:22.866 --> 37:24.074
Ugh!

37:24.076 --> 37:27.819
I saw the texts.

37:27.821 --> 37:30.897
And this, this is when
you were gonna meet her

37:30.899 --> 37:32.440
at that hotel.

37:32.442 --> 37:35.777
Imelda.

37:38.073 --> 37:40.299
Imelda is Dr. Royce.

37:42.244 --> 37:43.835
Dr. Imelda Royce.

37:43.837 --> 37:45.145
Oh, a doctor.

37:45.148 --> 37:47.121
At least that's better
than the last one.

37:47.123 --> 37:49.082
I'm a doctor too!

37:49.084 --> 37:52.627
I have a PhD. Wait.

37:52.629 --> 37:56.014
Dr. Royce is that surgeon...

37:56.016 --> 37:58.183
the surgeon you met the
day that you put your hand

37:58.185 --> 37:59.759
in that man's chest.

37:59.761 --> 38:00.760
Ah!

38:00.762 --> 38:02.354
Which...

38:02.356 --> 38:05.783
was really stupid and
reckless, by the way.

38:05.785 --> 38:08.840
Okay, maybe you should stop talking now.

38:08.843 --> 38:11.812
She had a meet-cute
over an open chest wound.

38:11.815 --> 38:13.457
That's not right!

38:13.459 --> 38:15.149
It wasn't a meet-cute.

38:15.151 --> 38:16.794
It was just a meet.

38:16.796 --> 38:19.757
And I was talking to
Dr. Royce... Imelda...

38:19.760 --> 38:21.736
about what it took to
get into med school.

38:21.739 --> 38:25.344
These are the dates of
when I can take my MCATs.

38:25.346 --> 38:28.329
Wait, you're thinking about
going to medical school?

38:28.331 --> 38:29.789
Since when?

38:29.791 --> 38:30.828
I don't know.

38:30.831 --> 38:33.164
That's why I didn't say anything.

38:33.167 --> 38:35.709
I mean...

38:35.712 --> 38:38.839
it was just such a crazy idea.

38:40.820 --> 38:43.487
Oh, baby, no.

38:43.489 --> 38:47.181
That's not crazy.

38:47.183 --> 38:49.943
Oh, my God, you'd be an amazing doctor.

38:51.813 --> 38:54.665
I'm so sorry I doubted you.

38:54.667 --> 38:57.650
I'm so relieved.

38:57.652 --> 38:59.336
I'm not.

39:01.990 --> 39:03.415
The kids forget something?

39:03.417 --> 39:04.490
No.

39:04.492 --> 39:06.367
You know, May is at the salon,

39:06.369 --> 39:10.389
I dropped Harry off at
the Andersons', and...

39:10.391 --> 39:12.540
thought I came to check in on you.

39:12.542 --> 39:15.594
Well, I'm...

39:15.596 --> 39:16.878
not fine.

39:16.880 --> 39:18.713
But I am managing.

39:18.715 --> 39:21.266
Yeah, me too.

39:21.268 --> 39:24.102
Seeing her like that just...

39:24.104 --> 39:27.531
Part of the job, I know that, but...

39:27.533 --> 39:30.058
seeing it, hearing it...

39:30.060 --> 39:33.537
Makes you feel powerless.

39:33.539 --> 39:35.539
When that gun went off,

39:35.541 --> 39:38.542
when I thought I'd lost her, I...

39:38.544 --> 39:43.213
I know I didn't, but I keep
coming going back to what if.

39:43.215 --> 39:46.550
And I... I don't know what
to do with that feeling.

39:51.390 --> 39:54.916
You know, a wise man once told me

39:54.918 --> 39:58.711
that he couldn't offer
me any sage advice.

39:58.713 --> 40:01.547
All he could offer me was a hammer.

40:01.549 --> 40:04.142
What do you want me to do with a hammer?

40:04.144 --> 40:07.095
I never did like that fireplace.

40:08.908 --> 40:10.414
Michael, Athena's gonna kill us.

40:10.416 --> 40:12.392
Don't worry.

40:12.394 --> 40:14.102
I'll build you guys a new one.

40:28.168 --> 40:29.927
Yeah!

40:37.419 --> 40:39.177
That one goes in a frame.

40:39.179 --> 40:41.179
Think you guys should
pay me for my services.

40:41.181 --> 40:42.424
Whoa, wait a minute.

40:42.427 --> 40:44.069
Let's take a look at the pictures first.

40:44.072 --> 40:45.163
Get over here.

40:45.166 --> 40:46.925
Okay, Ms. Nash, your turn.

40:46.928 --> 40:48.271
No, I don't think so.

40:48.274 --> 40:50.303
I'm in no condition for a photo shoot.

40:50.306 --> 40:52.473
Mom, I want you in my prom pictures.

40:52.475 --> 40:55.143
Oh, look at me, May.

40:55.145 --> 40:56.978
I see you.

40:56.980 --> 40:59.313
And I couldn't be more proud.

40:59.315 --> 41:01.533
You got him. You won.

41:01.535 --> 41:04.035
Those bruises show what kind
of fighter you really are

41:04.037 --> 41:07.372
and I want pictures to
remember this moment.

41:11.545 --> 41:14.287
Yes, hi. It's Josh Russo.

41:14.289 --> 41:15.621
I've thought about it.

41:15.623 --> 41:18.475
I'd like to give a statement in court.

41:22.005 --> 41:23.448
You're not happy for her?

41:26.605 --> 41:31.821
I just can't get past the
fact that she's leaving me.

41:37.979 --> 41:39.815
My Dr. Wilson.

41:48.463 --> 41:50.530
Hey, make sure you get my good side.

41:54.055 --> 41:56.814
Looks good.

41:56.817 --> 42:00.268
All right.

42:00.271 --> 42:02.210
Get it, Mama.

42:09.594 --> 42:10.835
_

42:10.838 --> 42:12.312
_

42:12.315 --> 42:15.181
Pacific West 1135.

42:15.183 --> 42:18.276
We were heading from
Phoenix into Union Station.

42:18.278 --> 42:21.430
We've crashed somewhere
close to the LA County line.

42:21.433 --> 42:22.639
Okay, so how many...

42:22.642 --> 42:24.105
There are multiple injuries.

42:24.108 --> 42:26.084
This is a mass casualty situation.

42:26.087 --> 42:28.421
You've gotta send out
every available RA unit.

42:28.424 --> 42:30.799
We need USAR for search and rescue,

42:30.802 --> 42:33.452
LAPD for traffic control.

42:33.455 --> 42:35.551
We're gonna need a
mobile command center.

42:35.554 --> 42:36.782
- I'll call them now.
- Okay.

42:36.785 --> 42:38.932
It seems like you've done this before.

42:38.935 --> 42:41.058
Yeah, but I was on your end of the line.

42:42.636 --> 42:45.303
I used to be a 9-1-1 dispatcher.
