WEBVTT

00:10.478 --> 00:11.779
WOMAN:
It's always about him.

00:11.812 --> 00:13.347
( woman mutters response
over phone )

00:13.381 --> 00:15.149
WOMAN:
He called me
at 7:30 last night,

00:15.183 --> 00:17.051
and expected me
to drop whatever
I was doing,

00:17.085 --> 00:18.186
just because he
was available.

00:18.219 --> 00:19.220
Hi.

00:19.253 --> 00:20.388
Did you have any plans?

00:20.421 --> 00:22.690
No, I didn't have any plans,
but that's not the point.

00:22.723 --> 00:24.492
I'm not crazy
about his friends, either.

00:24.525 --> 00:25.659
None of them are married.

00:25.693 --> 00:28.596
Point is, I know
where this is leading.

00:28.629 --> 00:29.763
Nowhere.

00:29.797 --> 00:31.065
( woman responding over phone )

00:31.099 --> 00:32.166
Yeah, I guess so.

00:32.200 --> 00:34.335
Give me a half hour to wash up,
I'll meet you there?

00:34.368 --> 00:36.337
No, I'm listening.

00:36.370 --> 00:38.672
Somebody sent me a package.

00:38.706 --> 00:39.807
What's in it?

00:39.840 --> 00:40.808
I don't know.

00:40.841 --> 00:41.809
Whatever it is,

00:41.842 --> 00:44.312
it's cold.

00:44.345 --> 00:46.080
( woman responding over phone )

00:46.114 --> 00:49.617
( screaming )

00:54.222 --> 00:57.791
Captioning sponsored by
PARAMOUNT TELEVISION

00:57.825 --> 01:02.730
and CBS

01:35.496 --> 01:39.733
My, my, you are hypnotic,
aren't you?

01:39.767 --> 01:40.634
No thank you,

01:40.668 --> 01:41.735
Mr. Palmer.

01:41.769 --> 01:44.172
Better to poke around
with these.

01:44.205 --> 01:46.540
Did you know the word "autopsy"

01:46.574 --> 01:48.342
comes from the Greek, meaning

01:48.376 --> 01:49.843
"to see for one's self?"

01:49.877 --> 01:50.811
JIMMY:
They didn't

01:50.844 --> 01:52.480
offer Greek in my high school.

01:52.513 --> 01:54.715
Oh, perhaps
we should try Latin, then.

01:54.748 --> 01:57.851
Are you familiar
with the term "keratoplasty"?

01:57.885 --> 02:00.154
Uh, cornea
transplant surgery.

02:00.188 --> 02:02.490
Oh, then your education
did paid off.

02:02.523 --> 02:03.891
My mother will
be pleased

02:03.924 --> 02:05.793
to hear that.

02:05.826 --> 02:07.428
GIBBS:
What do we
know, Duck?

02:07.461 --> 02:09.730
Oh, I just started, Jethro.

02:09.763 --> 02:11.832
How did these come
into our possession?

02:11.865 --> 02:14.335
They were in a package
delivered to a petty officer.

02:14.368 --> 02:16.337
Mailman put them
in the wrong box.

02:16.370 --> 02:17.771
Neighbor opened
them up, and

02:17.805 --> 02:19.240
scared the hell out of her.

02:19.273 --> 02:20.941
Yeah, I should imagine so.

02:20.974 --> 02:22.943
Oh, these have
been enucleated

02:22.976 --> 02:25.379
and preserved with skill
and care by a surgeon.

02:25.413 --> 02:26.714
Assuming they're
as healthy

02:26.747 --> 02:29.550
as they appear,
transplantation would be

02:29.583 --> 02:31.952
the inevitable conclusion.

02:31.985 --> 02:34.588
We don't necessarily
need your body

02:34.622 --> 02:37.791
to discover
what happened to you.

02:37.825 --> 02:39.593
They say

02:39.627 --> 02:42.496
that the eyes are the windows
to the soul.

02:44.265 --> 02:46.800
KATE:
Wow. I'm impressed.

02:46.834 --> 02:47.701
( laughs )

02:47.735 --> 02:49.837
You can actually sleep
with your eyes open.

02:49.870 --> 02:51.572
Yeah, I'm meditating.

02:51.605 --> 02:53.907
Yeah, on how much
you drank last night,

02:53.941 --> 02:55.643
or trying to remember her name?

02:55.676 --> 02:56.977
I don't kiss and tell, Kate.

02:57.010 --> 02:58.612
McGEE:
Since when?

02:58.646 --> 02:59.947
I know more about your sex life
than I do

02:59.980 --> 03:00.914
my own, Tony.

03:00.948 --> 03:02.916
Well, that's not hard
to believe, Probie,

03:02.950 --> 03:04.818
considering you
don't have one.

03:04.852 --> 03:05.986
KATE:
Gibbs wants to know

03:06.019 --> 03:07.688
everything there is to know

03:07.721 --> 03:09.957
about this package,
and if I were you, I wouldn't

03:09.990 --> 03:11.859
let him catch
you napping.

03:11.892 --> 03:13.327
Thanks for the advice,

03:13.361 --> 03:15.263
but I got it covered.
GIBBS:
Anybody,

03:15.296 --> 03:16.397
talk to me.

03:18.299 --> 03:19.099
Well, I'm checking

03:19.132 --> 03:21.001
with eye banks
and the MTCs that handle

03:21.034 --> 03:22.870
tissue and organ donation.
GIBBS:
Any of them

03:22.903 --> 03:24.372
missing a set of blue eyes?

03:24.405 --> 03:27.375
Well, I haven't heard
back from them yet.

03:27.408 --> 03:28.609
Ah!
McGEE:
Uh, no return address

03:28.642 --> 03:30.344
on the package, boss,
but I did contact

03:30.378 --> 03:31.712
the post office.
Yeah. And?

03:31.745 --> 03:33.013
They are running
the tracking number

03:33.046 --> 03:34.382
from the barcode.

03:34.415 --> 03:35.583
KATE:
Hi, this is Agent Todd...

03:35.616 --> 03:37.985
Yeah, I'm gonna call them back
right now.

03:38.018 --> 03:39.353
KATE:
Right, I called...

03:39.387 --> 03:41.822
some... some eyes...

03:41.855 --> 03:43.757
TONY:
Package was addressed

03:43.791 --> 03:46.794
to a Petty Officer Second
Class Benjamin Horlacher.

03:46.827 --> 03:48.562
Stationed at Dam Neck.

03:48.596 --> 03:50.531
Currently on a 72,
due back tomorrow.

03:50.564 --> 03:52.300
Now that's a 72-hour...

03:52.333 --> 03:54.034
leave there, Katie.

03:54.067 --> 03:56.003
He's a student
at the Navy and Marine Corps

03:56.036 --> 03:57.571
Intelligence
Training Center.

03:57.605 --> 03:58.806
Ah.

03:58.839 --> 04:00.974
Been living at that address

04:01.008 --> 04:02.510
since last September.

04:02.543 --> 04:04.378
Military records
are clean.

04:04.412 --> 04:06.013
Only things that stand out
are a speeding ticket

04:06.046 --> 04:07.681
two months ago, and, uh,

04:07.715 --> 04:09.717
he didn't pay his cable bill
last week.

04:11.819 --> 04:12.986
Good to know somebody

04:13.020 --> 04:16.023
is working around here.

04:16.056 --> 04:17.858
KATE:
Uh, thank you.

04:17.891 --> 04:19.893
So far, no one's reported

04:19.927 --> 04:21.829
missing a pair
of cobalt blues, Gibbs.

04:21.862 --> 04:23.731
McGEE:
The package
was shipped

04:23.764 --> 04:25.533
two days ago
from Ciudad

04:25.566 --> 04:27.401
del Este, Paraguay.
TONY:
Paraguay?

04:27.435 --> 04:28.869
TONY:
The T-B-A.
That's the

04:28.902 --> 04:30.971
Tri-Border Area.

04:31.004 --> 04:33.374
That's where Paraguay,
Argentina and Brazil meet.

04:33.407 --> 04:34.808
It's a base
of operations

04:34.842 --> 04:36.710
for smugglers,
drug trafficking,

04:36.744 --> 04:38.746
illegal-organ
trafficking.

04:38.779 --> 04:39.980
And Hezbollah
and Al Qaeda cells.

04:40.013 --> 04:40.981
All right.

04:41.014 --> 04:42.015
We'll meet you

04:42.049 --> 04:43.384
out front, boss.

04:43.417 --> 04:44.585
We're going to Dam Neck.

04:45.986 --> 04:47.955
You didn't move all morning.

04:47.988 --> 04:49.723
How did you know that?

04:49.757 --> 04:51.525
Work smarter, not harder, Katie.

04:51.559 --> 04:52.526
( laughs )

04:52.560 --> 04:53.661
You'll live longer.

04:53.694 --> 04:54.728
Probie, I want to
know who shipped

04:54.762 --> 04:57.097
that package from Paraguay
as soon as I get back.

04:57.130 --> 04:58.098
You got it, boss.

04:58.131 --> 04:59.099
Uh, Tony.

04:59.132 --> 05:00.401
TONY:
Let's move it, Kate.

05:00.434 --> 05:01.569
( scoffs )

05:01.602 --> 05:02.703
WOMAN:
Believe me,

05:02.736 --> 05:03.971
this isn't the first time

05:04.004 --> 05:06.807
that fool mailman put
stuff in the wrong box.

05:06.840 --> 05:08.709
I got a video of
some college girls

05:08.742 --> 05:10.944
just last week
flashing their
you know whats.

05:10.978 --> 05:12.112
When's the last time

05:12.145 --> 05:14.348
you saw Petty Officer
Horlacher, ma'am?

05:14.382 --> 05:15.516
Couple days ago.

05:15.549 --> 05:16.684
What can you tell us
about him?

05:16.717 --> 05:18.552
He's quiet, he
keeps to himself.

05:18.586 --> 05:19.720
He's got a
girlfriend.

05:19.753 --> 05:20.888
They live together?

05:20.921 --> 05:21.955
Who knows,
these days?

05:21.989 --> 05:23.123
She comes and goes.

05:23.156 --> 05:24.658
Think he made her a key.

05:24.692 --> 05:26.794
It's a violation of
the lease, but, uh,

05:26.827 --> 05:28.095
I look the other way.

05:28.128 --> 05:30.097
We'd like to look
at Horlacher-/////!s apartment.

05:30.130 --> 05:30.898
Is that a problem?

05:30.931 --> 05:33.100
Considering what
was in that package?

05:33.133 --> 05:34.568
Please do.

05:36.069 --> 05:38.806
I see you're not
wearing a wedding
ring, Agent Gibbs.

05:40.007 --> 05:43.477
Maybe you'd like to
inspect that video

05:43.511 --> 05:45.513
with me when you're done.

05:52.986 --> 05:54.988
He is single.

06:03.664 --> 06:05.733
MANAGER:
Now, how does
a fine man

06:05.766 --> 06:07.000
like that stay single?

06:07.034 --> 06:08.636
( laughs )

06:08.669 --> 06:09.837
Well, he didn't.

06:09.870 --> 06:11.472
He's been married
three times.

06:11.505 --> 06:12.606
Mm.

06:12.640 --> 06:15.142
Let you know when
we're finished,
Miss Robinson.

06:15.175 --> 06:17.044
Okay.

06:17.077 --> 06:18.512
Wow.

06:18.546 --> 06:19.913
I'll take the bedroom.

06:19.947 --> 06:23.150
This guy's already in trouble.

06:23.183 --> 06:25.419
Girlfriend's taken over.

06:25.453 --> 06:27.154
Maybe not.

06:27.187 --> 06:30.123
Killing Fields,
Undercover Agent.

06:30.157 --> 06:32.693
There's makeup
in the bathroom.

06:32.726 --> 06:34.862
There's women's clothes
in his closet.

06:34.895 --> 06:36.764
( laughs )

06:36.797 --> 06:39.066
But I can't say much
for her taste.

06:39.099 --> 06:41.101
GIBBS:
Let's see if we can
find out her name.

06:41.134 --> 06:42.903
KATE:
Right.

06:42.936 --> 06:44.905
( keys jangling )

06:45.839 --> 06:47.074
Who the hell are you?!

06:47.107 --> 06:48.175
GIBBS:
Petty Officer

06:48.208 --> 06:50.210
Benjamin Horlacher?

06:50.243 --> 06:51.211
NCIS.

06:51.244 --> 06:52.212
What's going
on, sir?

06:52.245 --> 06:54.548
We're here to
investigate

06:54.582 --> 06:55.415
a package
delivered to you,

06:55.449 --> 06:56.984
opened by mistake
by your neighbor.

06:57.017 --> 06:59.520
Sent from Ciudad del Este,
Paraguay.

06:59.553 --> 07:01.622
It contained human organs.

07:01.655 --> 07:03.023
A pair of eyes.

07:03.056 --> 07:06.627
Eyes? You got to be
kidding me, sir.

07:06.660 --> 07:09.663
Where've you been the last
couple of days, Petty Officer?

07:09.697 --> 07:10.731
On a 72.

07:10.764 --> 07:11.899
Visiting my family
in New Jersey.

07:11.932 --> 07:12.733
TONY:
You training to be

07:12.766 --> 07:14.167
an intelligence analyst
at Dam Neck?

07:14.201 --> 07:15.335
Yes, sir.

07:15.368 --> 07:16.970
What area of the world
do you cover there,
Petty Officer?

07:17.004 --> 07:18.038
Central and
South America.

07:18.071 --> 07:19.206
You ever been to Paraguay?

07:19.239 --> 07:20.608
Never. Look, I
don't know what's

07:20.641 --> 07:21.742
going on here,
but I'm sure...

07:21.775 --> 07:23.443
Maybe your girlfriend
does.

07:24.745 --> 07:27.114
I don't have a girlfriend.

07:27.147 --> 07:28.949
So what woman is keeping

07:28.982 --> 07:31.184
all of her clothes
in your bedroom?

07:31.218 --> 07:35.889
We broke up...
a month ago.

07:35.923 --> 07:38.191
She hasn't come back yet
to pick up her stuff.

07:42.295 --> 07:44.832
I'm telling you, I don't
know anything about eyes.

07:46.934 --> 07:49.002
Shouldn't you have
a warrant or something

07:49.036 --> 07:50.203
to be in here?

07:50.237 --> 07:53.106
You keep yourself available,
Petty Officer.

07:53.140 --> 07:55.242
We'll have more questions
for you.

07:55.275 --> 07:56.644
Yes, sir.

08:04.685 --> 08:06.820
KATE:
There was an open lipstick

08:06.854 --> 08:08.121
in the bathroom.
The girlfriend's

08:08.155 --> 08:08.856
still living
there, Gibbs.

08:08.889 --> 08:09.757
Definitely
hiding something.

08:09.790 --> 08:10.558
Oh, yeah.
( cell phone rings )

08:10.591 --> 08:13.293
So why are we
letting him walk?

08:13.326 --> 08:14.294
GIBBS:
We're not.

08:14.327 --> 08:15.563
You two are staying here.

08:15.596 --> 08:16.897
Watch him.
I want to know

08:16.930 --> 08:18.298
what he does next.

08:18.331 --> 08:19.299
Yeah, Abbs?

08:19.332 --> 08:21.735
Jethro, can you hear me?

08:21.769 --> 08:23.103
Oh, he can hear you.

08:23.136 --> 08:24.905
Whaddya got?
Well, I...

08:24.938 --> 08:26.306
I'm sorry.

08:26.339 --> 08:28.609
Ladies first.

08:28.642 --> 08:30.811
That is so sweet.

08:30.844 --> 08:32.279
Oh, it's a pleasure, I'm sure.

08:32.312 --> 08:34.147
Today, Abby.
Okay.

08:34.181 --> 08:35.649
So I ran the DNA

08:35.683 --> 08:37.250
through AFDIL.
I didn't get a match,

08:37.284 --> 08:39.286
but we can definitely
start calling

08:39.319 --> 08:40.954
Old Blue Eyes
a Jane Doe.

08:40.988 --> 08:42.723
Those babies are female.

08:42.756 --> 08:44.324
And I think
you'd like to know

08:44.357 --> 08:46.627
that Ms. Doe gave up her eyes
unwillingly.

08:46.660 --> 08:48.161
How do you know?

08:48.195 --> 08:49.597
Well, at first blush, the eyes

08:49.630 --> 08:51.632
seemed flawless.

08:51.665 --> 08:54.067
But careful dissection
showed large

08:54.101 --> 08:55.803
intraorbital
hematoma.

08:55.836 --> 08:56.670
Meaning?

08:56.704 --> 08:57.671
Well, Jethro,

08:57.705 --> 08:58.772
if you slice
into an eye

08:58.806 --> 09:00.073
like you would,
say, an egg,

09:00.107 --> 09:01.675
you risk nicking
the blood vessels.

09:01.709 --> 09:02.843
But if you

09:02.876 --> 09:05.345
gingerly peel apart the eye,

09:05.378 --> 09:07.915
layer by layer,
like an onion,

09:07.948 --> 09:09.249
then you can be sure...

09:09.282 --> 09:11.351
Uh, Ducky, the short version.

09:11.384 --> 09:13.020
Cardiac arrest.

09:13.053 --> 09:16.323
I found abnormally
high levels of potassium
in the vitreous

09:16.356 --> 09:17.591
and choroids of both eyes.

09:17.625 --> 09:18.659
I'd say

09:18.692 --> 09:20.994
she was most likely
poisoned.

09:21.028 --> 09:22.696
Jethro, did you know

09:22.730 --> 09:26.233
that corneal transplantation
dates back to 1905...?

09:26.266 --> 09:28.301
One source of tissue
back then

09:28.335 --> 09:30.337
were prisoners
on Death Row, who...

09:30.370 --> 09:31.739
( loud click )
Jethro?

09:31.772 --> 09:34.141
He's not there.

09:34.174 --> 09:35.643
Oh, we lost
the connection?

09:35.676 --> 09:38.311
No, he hung up.

09:38.345 --> 09:39.813
Oh...

09:39.847 --> 09:42.916
But you can tell me
the rest of the story.

09:42.950 --> 09:44.885
Go back to the part where
you're peeling the layers

09:44.918 --> 09:46.253
off the eyeball.

09:49.657 --> 09:51.659
Oh...

09:53.060 --> 09:56.363
Oh, God...

09:56.396 --> 09:58.131
Wake up.

09:58.165 --> 10:00.200
I am awake.

10:00.233 --> 10:01.635
Could you turn
the heat up, please?

10:01.669 --> 10:02.736
I'm freezing.
!
Can't.

10:02.770 --> 10:06.106
Smoke from the tailpipe will
give away our position.

10:06.139 --> 10:08.909
Great. I can't feel my legs
here.

10:08.942 --> 10:09.977
We can do

10:10.010 --> 10:11.979
what the Eskimos do
to keep warm.

10:12.012 --> 10:13.046
What's that?

10:13.080 --> 10:15.415
They press

10:15.448 --> 10:16.784
their bodies
together.

10:18.385 --> 10:21.889
Of course, the effect
is greatly improved
if you're naked.

10:21.922 --> 10:24.792
There's not enough liquor
on the planet

10:24.825 --> 10:26.359
to make that happen, Tony.

10:26.393 --> 10:28.729
I wasn't suggesting
the naked part.

10:28.762 --> 10:31.999
But if you want
to freeze...

10:33.801 --> 10:34.835
freeze.

10:37.905 --> 10:39.740
Oh, I need a vacation.

10:41.408 --> 10:43.310
( chuckling )

10:43.343 --> 10:45.813
Where would you go?

10:45.846 --> 10:47.047
Ooh, someplace warm,

10:47.080 --> 10:50.017
somewhere where there's
no cell phone reception.

10:50.050 --> 10:52.152
The tropics.

10:52.185 --> 10:54.654
Oh, yes, the tropics
would be nice.

10:56.356 --> 10:58.191
Horlacher's light
just went off.

10:58.225 --> 10:59.760
Well, he's probably
going to bed;

10:59.793 --> 11:01.695
it-/////!s midnight.

11:01.729 --> 11:02.662
Oh, God...

11:02.696 --> 11:05.298
do you think we're going to have
to stay here

11:05.332 --> 11:07.434
all night?
!
Why don't you call
Gibbs and find out?

11:07.467 --> 11:09.402
Why don't you call
Gibbs and find out?

11:09.436 --> 11:12.239
Because I know the answer.

11:12.272 --> 11:14.241
Oh, I need a vacation!

11:14.274 --> 11:15.776
( gunshot )

11:21.414 --> 11:23.316
What the hell was that?
Get back in
your apartment.

11:36.964 --> 11:39.933
MAN ON TV:
Let's say you're
just taking out insurance.

11:41.068 --> 11:42.002
WOMAN ON TV:
I haven't any money

11:42.035 --> 11:43.470
Not the kind
you want.

11:43.503 --> 11:44.738
No?
No!

11:44.772 --> 11:46.206
But your adopted
family has.

11:46.239 --> 11:47.240
WOMAN:
You think I'd ask them

11:47.274 --> 11:48.241
for money for you?

11:48.275 --> 11:48.909
MAN:
You don't ask.

11:48.942 --> 11:50.443
You're a woman,
aren't you?

11:50.477 --> 11:51.411
Use your head.
No.

11:51.444 --> 11:53.446
Clear.
WOMAN:
No, I won't do it.

11:53.480 --> 11:56.416
MAN:
Kid would have
a pretty rough time...

12:06.359 --> 12:09.062
TONY:
He had a secret,
all right.

12:18.338 --> 12:20.040
GIBBS:
What do you have, Duck?

12:20.073 --> 12:21.875
Well, it's
a sad situation, Jethro.

12:21.909 --> 12:23.310
Even in today's
enlightened age,

12:23.343 --> 12:26.346
transexualism is
terribly misunderstood.

12:28.081 --> 12:29.382
His identity as a male...

12:29.416 --> 12:30.483
Doctor...

12:30.517 --> 12:31.384
Yes, Mr. Palmer?

12:31.418 --> 12:33.486
I think Agent Gibbs
was referring more

12:33.520 --> 12:34.955
to the forensic

12:34.988 --> 12:36.256
aspect of, the, uh...

12:36.289 --> 12:39.226
situation... maybe.

12:39.259 --> 12:41.294
Has head-slapping been
effective for you, Jethro?

12:41.328 --> 12:43.163
Yeah. Look at the way
DiNozzo turned out.

12:43.196 --> 12:45.899
DUCKY ( chuckles ):
The pattern of
gunpowder residue

12:45.933 --> 12:47.935
and the exit wound
on his back suggests

12:47.968 --> 12:50.303
the weapon was held
directly over the heart.

12:50.337 --> 12:51.939
Death was
instantaneous.

12:53.073 --> 12:56.343
In all probability,
he took his own life.

12:56.376 --> 12:57.510
McGEE:
Boss, don't most suicides

12:57.544 --> 12:59.579
shoot themselves in the head?

12:59.612 --> 13:01.448
Men. Not women.

13:01.481 --> 13:03.450
McGEE:
Guess he didn't think
of himself as a man.

13:03.483 --> 13:07.187
KATE:
Well, she must've known that her
secret was going to come out.

13:07.220 --> 13:08.588
Don't you mean,
he must've known

13:08.621 --> 13:11.224
that his secret was
going to come out?

13:11.258 --> 13:12.525
Psychosexually speaking,

13:12.559 --> 13:16.296
Tony, Horlacher was a woman
trapped in a man's body.

13:16.329 --> 13:18.598
And when she killed herself,

13:18.631 --> 13:19.933
she freed herself.

13:19.967 --> 13:20.800
Thus the note.

13:22.302 --> 13:24.337
Hey, you know what
this reminds me of?

13:24.371 --> 13:28.308
Pacci's suspect that we were
staking-out last year.

13:28.341 --> 13:29.142
KATE:
That's right.

13:29.176 --> 13:31.478
Yeah, the beautiful
pre-op transsexual

13:31.511 --> 13:33.013
that seduced Tony.

13:33.046 --> 13:34.381
She didn't seduce me.
I was undercover.

13:34.414 --> 13:36.483
Yeah, well, didn't you
stick your tongue down...

13:36.516 --> 13:38.018
Okay, I took one
for the team,

13:38.051 --> 13:38.852
all right?!

13:38.886 --> 13:41.288
Someone had
to keep her occupied.

13:41.321 --> 13:43.056
Don't you mean him?

13:44.257 --> 13:45.325
( grunts )

13:45.358 --> 13:46.393
( chuckles )

13:53.466 --> 13:54.935
I'm sorry.

13:54.968 --> 13:56.003
Sorry, boss.

13:57.370 --> 13:59.339
Uh, I'm sorry.

14:02.342 --> 14:04.011
Uh, I'll get you
a fresh one.

14:04.044 --> 14:06.179
It was black, right?

14:06.213 --> 14:07.380
Black it is.

14:09.282 --> 14:11.251
You didn't see anyone else

14:11.284 --> 14:12.252
enter or leave?

14:12.285 --> 14:13.954
KATE:
No, she was here alone.

14:13.987 --> 14:15.655
GIBBS:
All right, check
his phone records.

14:15.688 --> 14:17.290
Maybe he made
some other phone calls

14:17.324 --> 14:18.625
while he was deciding
to off himself.

14:18.658 --> 14:22.262
Already on it.
I'll have them tomorrow.

14:22.295 --> 14:24.397
I'm thinking there was no
girlfriend, Gibbs.

14:24.431 --> 14:26.033
That he was just living
a double life.

14:26.066 --> 14:28.601
Puts a whole new spin
on "don't ask, don't tell."

14:28.635 --> 14:31.504
I am much more interested
in the "cross-dressing sailor

14:31.538 --> 14:33.974
who's getting body parts
in the mail" spin.

14:34.007 --> 14:36.376
Get he-she's
laptop to Abby.

14:46.653 --> 14:48.421
Hey, Gibbs,
you're just in time.

14:49.322 --> 14:51.224
Okay, from the outside,

14:51.258 --> 14:53.226
it looks like a normal laptop.

14:53.260 --> 14:54.361
But on the inside?

14:56.396 --> 14:57.330
Voila.

14:57.364 --> 14:58.465
Fortified with the kind
of data encryption

14:58.498 --> 15:01.034
that only someone with
something to hide would have.

15:01.068 --> 15:03.236
A petty officer's protocol--
far more sophisticated

15:03.270 --> 15:05.338
than any PGP or DES
software I've seen.

15:05.372 --> 15:07.374
At first, we didn't
even understand

15:07.407 --> 15:08.608
his obfuscation algorithm.

15:08.641 --> 15:10.043
Really hardcore stuff.

15:10.077 --> 15:11.311
Very, very hardcore.

15:11.344 --> 15:12.445
Did you get
in or not?

15:12.479 --> 15:13.480
Yeah.

15:13.513 --> 15:14.481
And no.

15:14.514 --> 15:15.582
There's just one layer

15:15.615 --> 15:16.683
we haven't cracked yet.

15:16.716 --> 15:18.385
McGEE:
But we did get

15:18.418 --> 15:20.453
Petty Officer Horlacher's blog.

15:20.487 --> 15:22.422
ABBY:
It's a personal
Internet journal.

15:22.455 --> 15:24.691
Web-log... blog.
Get it?

15:24.724 --> 15:26.593
Pig Latin.

15:26.626 --> 15:28.962
Actually that
would be "Ebway

15:28.996 --> 15:30.397
Oglay."

15:30.430 --> 15:33.000
Pig Latin adds a "way"

15:33.033 --> 15:34.367
to words starting
with vowels,

15:34.401 --> 15:35.635
and "ay" to words

15:35.668 --> 15:37.004
starting with consonants

15:37.037 --> 15:38.438
after moving part
of the word...

15:38.471 --> 15:40.073
I'm sure you knew

15:40.107 --> 15:41.241
that already.

15:41.274 --> 15:42.642
The blob say anything useful?

15:42.675 --> 15:44.011
ABBY:
It's mostly

15:44.044 --> 15:45.278
men are from Mars stuff.

15:45.312 --> 15:46.713
He was very interested
in the differences

15:46.746 --> 15:47.714
between men and women.

15:47.747 --> 15:49.216
Men are from where?

15:49.249 --> 15:50.383
Mars, Gibbs, and women
are from Venus.

15:50.417 --> 15:51.651
McGEE:
It's a famous book

15:51.684 --> 15:52.519
about relationships

15:52.552 --> 15:54.654
and communication
between the sexes.

15:54.687 --> 15:55.755
ABBY:
There was
that TV show

15:55.788 --> 15:57.390
and a board game
and the guy wrote

15:57.424 --> 15:59.059
like ten sequels...
I'm beginning to

15:59.092 --> 16:01.028
understand why you were
married three times.

16:01.061 --> 16:02.529
Abby!
Come look at it
for yourself.

16:05.765 --> 16:07.534
GIBBS:
"Inside every good man

16:07.567 --> 16:08.568
there is a better woman."

16:08.601 --> 16:10.370
"LOL"?

16:10.403 --> 16:12.572
McGEE:
That's "laughing out loud."

16:12.605 --> 16:15.075
Which, of course,
can be topped by...

16:15.108 --> 16:16.209
"R-O-T-F-L-O-L."

16:16.243 --> 16:18.778
"Rolling on the floor
laughing out loud."

16:18.811 --> 16:19.746
Keep looking.

16:19.779 --> 16:21.614
Horlacher was leading
two different lives.

16:21.648 --> 16:22.749
I want to know

16:22.782 --> 16:25.685
everything there is to know
about both of them. A-S-A-P.

16:25.718 --> 16:27.520
Onway itway,

16:27.554 --> 16:29.522
Ibbsgay!
( chuckles )

16:29.556 --> 16:31.024
KATE:
There was a time

16:31.058 --> 16:32.025
I would have killed

16:32.059 --> 16:33.360
for a pair of
eyes like that.

16:33.393 --> 16:35.128
Think she was a blonde
or a brunette?

16:35.162 --> 16:36.463
What difference
does it make?

16:36.496 --> 16:37.497
I love brunettes.

16:37.530 --> 16:39.566
I bet she was beautiful.

16:39.599 --> 16:41.568
Are you telling me
that you're attracted to

16:41.601 --> 16:42.569
a disembodied
set of eyeballs?

16:42.602 --> 16:44.671
Weird, huh?

16:44.704 --> 16:46.539
More like disturbing.

16:46.573 --> 16:47.807
It's kind of like

16:47.840 --> 16:48.808
that movie Laura.

16:48.841 --> 16:49.809
Laura?

16:49.842 --> 16:52.545
Yeah. Old movie by

16:52.579 --> 16:53.546
Otto Preminger.

16:53.580 --> 16:54.414
It's about a cop

16:54.447 --> 16:56.249
who falls in love
with the painting

16:56.283 --> 16:58.418
of a girl whose head's been
blown off by a shotgun.

16:58.451 --> 16:59.619
Sounds romantic.

16:59.652 --> 17:01.054
You have
no idea.

17:01.088 --> 17:03.490
Gene Tierney was a goddess.

17:03.523 --> 17:05.292
What do we have?

17:05.325 --> 17:07.427
Well, I called

17:07.460 --> 17:09.129
Petty Officer
Horlacher's family.

17:09.162 --> 17:11.531
He lied about paying them
a visit over the weekend.

17:11.564 --> 17:13.233
They hadn't heard from him
in over a year.

17:13.266 --> 17:15.102
Still can't find
a connection to
Paraguay, boss.

17:15.135 --> 17:17.470
He's never deployed overseas.
Doesn't even have a passport.

17:17.504 --> 17:20.607
Yeah, and what I want to know is
how a suicidal transvestite

17:20.640 --> 17:22.542
attended a top-secret
intelligence school

17:22.575 --> 17:23.710
without anybody noticing.

17:23.743 --> 17:25.645
You contact
his faculty advisor yet?

17:25.678 --> 17:26.746
I was just about to.

17:26.779 --> 17:28.415
Name's Lieutenant
Commander

17:28.448 --> 17:29.849
Guyman Purcell, Retired.

17:29.882 --> 17:31.084
Got his PhD

17:31.118 --> 17:32.152
in South American
studies.

17:32.185 --> 17:33.486
I think we should
interview him.

17:33.520 --> 17:35.788
Yeah? Why's that?

17:35.822 --> 17:37.690
According
to Horlacher's phone records,

17:37.724 --> 17:40.593
he called the Commander right
before he killed himself.

17:40.627 --> 17:43.330
That's good work, Tony.

17:43.363 --> 17:44.597
Get the car...

17:44.631 --> 17:46.366
Kate.

17:50.570 --> 17:53.440
Okay, now that
we've learned a little bit

17:53.473 --> 17:55.608
about recruiting double agents,

17:55.642 --> 17:58.111
let's take a moment to consider
some of the risks

17:58.145 --> 17:59.112
involved.

17:59.146 --> 18:00.147
Anybody?

18:01.814 --> 18:02.582
DiNozzo.

18:02.615 --> 18:06.886
Would you like
to become left-handed?

18:06.919 --> 18:09.589
You going for your
brown-nose badge this week?

18:09.622 --> 18:11.491
You're just jealous
'cause it's working.

18:11.524 --> 18:13.760
Yes, Miss Ellsworth.

18:13.793 --> 18:16.329
What kind of a risk
does a double agent pose?

18:16.363 --> 18:18.465
He could double-cross
you back, sir?

18:18.498 --> 18:19.466
Exactly.

18:19.499 --> 18:21.634
You have just
convinced someone

18:21.668 --> 18:24.771
to betray that which
he holds dearest.

18:24.804 --> 18:26.606
His country. His family.

18:26.639 --> 18:28.675
Perhaps even himself.

18:28.708 --> 18:30.677
These are
weak-minded individuals.

18:30.710 --> 18:35.448
If your recruit proves
untrustworthy, he must be

18:35.482 --> 18:37.317
either coerced or abandoned,

18:37.350 --> 18:40.320
but nothing can
jeopardize the mission.

18:40.353 --> 18:42.222
PURCELL:
Petty Officer Horlacher

18:42.255 --> 18:43.390
is a decent student.

18:43.423 --> 18:45.458
That's all I know
about him, really.

18:45.492 --> 18:47.260
You cover Ciudad
del Este in your class?

18:47.294 --> 18:48.361
The Tri-Border Area.

18:48.395 --> 18:49.162
Of course. Why?

18:49.196 --> 18:50.863
Horlacher got a
package from there.

18:50.897 --> 18:52.432
Inside were a pair
of human eyes.

18:52.465 --> 18:53.533
TONY:
Cut out of
a woman's head.

18:53.566 --> 18:55.235
God. that's horrible.

18:55.268 --> 18:57.237
What did the Petty
Officer say about it?

18:57.270 --> 18:59.439
Claims to have not
known anything about it.

18:59.472 --> 19:02.409
Did you ever spend any personal
time with him outside of class,

19:02.442 --> 19:04.211
Mr. Purcell?
No, in my field,
the students

19:04.244 --> 19:06.379
tend to see their instructors
as larger than life.

19:06.413 --> 19:08.715
It's best not
to get too attached.

19:08.748 --> 19:10.383
So that would be a "no"?

19:10.417 --> 19:11.884
Am I being interrogated
for some reason?

19:11.918 --> 19:13.353
Depends.
On what, Agent Gibbs?

19:13.386 --> 19:14.921
Why he called you last night.

19:14.954 --> 19:16.289
Many of my students

19:16.323 --> 19:17.457
call me at home.
Last night,

19:17.490 --> 19:18.458
Benjamin wanted to know

19:18.491 --> 19:19.659
if I'd give
him an extension

19:19.692 --> 19:20.960
on a paper
due this week.

19:20.993 --> 19:22.562
Did you give
it to him?
Yes.

19:22.595 --> 19:25.465
Good. He could use it.

19:25.498 --> 19:26.566
He's in trouble?

19:26.599 --> 19:27.634
He's dead.

19:27.667 --> 19:28.935
He killed
himself last night.

19:28.968 --> 19:30.770
Right after he got
off the phone with you.

19:32.772 --> 19:34.474
I don't know what to say.

19:34.507 --> 19:35.808
Why don't we start
with what you said to him?

19:35.842 --> 19:37.710
Well, this wasn't
the first time

19:37.744 --> 19:38.911
he asked for
an extension.

19:38.945 --> 19:40.313
I was hard on him.
I told him

19:40.347 --> 19:41.648
if he couldn't
keep up, I'd drop him

19:41.681 --> 19:42.649
from the course.

19:42.682 --> 19:44.317
It would ruin
his career.

19:44.351 --> 19:46.319
I was trying
to motivate him, Agent Gibbs.

19:46.353 --> 19:47.587
Hold his feet
to the fire.

19:47.620 --> 19:48.588
I never thought he'd....

19:48.621 --> 19:49.789
Jump in?

19:53.025 --> 19:54.661
KATE:
Thank you.

19:54.694 --> 19:56.663
The retired

19:56.696 --> 19:59.432
Lieutenant Commander's got
his own consulting business,

19:59.466 --> 20:00.433
Purcell Security Group.

20:00.467 --> 20:02.569
They specialize
in...
Intelligence work, boss.

20:02.602 --> 20:04.671
They've got several high-paying
government contracts.

20:04.704 --> 20:06.439
The biggest
one is...
Southcom.

20:06.473 --> 20:08.908
He's traveled back and forth
to Paraguay ten times

20:08.941 --> 20:11.544
in the last six months, and
the area he's been working...

20:11.578 --> 20:14.281
Ciudad del Este.
I'm thinking

20:14.314 --> 20:15.682
this guy's a spook.

20:15.715 --> 20:16.583
BOTH:
Or working for spooks.

20:16.616 --> 20:18.618
Everything concerning
his consulting work

20:18.651 --> 20:19.952
has been flagged
way above my clearance.

20:19.986 --> 20:21.654
Great.
( phone ringing )

20:21.688 --> 20:22.622
Because I hate spooks.

20:22.655 --> 20:24.457
Yeah. Gibbs.

20:24.491 --> 20:25.792
ABBY:
I might know who the eyes'

20:25.825 --> 20:27.627
former owner was.
Okay, we're
on our way.

20:27.660 --> 20:29.896
Abby thinks she's found
the body that goes with those.

20:29.929 --> 20:31.364
( hisses )

20:34.834 --> 20:36.969
( dramatic music playing )

20:37.003 --> 20:39.306
Business in Central
and South America

20:39.339 --> 20:41.641
comes with its own
special set of problems.

20:41.674 --> 20:43.843
Are you working
in a hostile environment?

20:43.876 --> 20:47.447
Are you dealing with corrupt or
untrustworthy local officials?

20:47.480 --> 20:48.848
My course
can make the difference

20:48.881 --> 20:50.450
between success and failure,

20:50.483 --> 20:51.984
life and death...

20:52.018 --> 20:53.386
There's about
four hours

20:53.420 --> 20:54.654
of online
instruction classes

20:54.687 --> 20:55.888
associated
with this website.

20:55.922 --> 20:58.825
They were bookmarked on Petty
Officer Horlacher's hard drive.

20:58.858 --> 21:01.361
And after watching them,
I can say with certainty

21:01.394 --> 21:02.862
Purcell needs a charisma bypass.

21:02.895 --> 21:04.997
What does this have to do
with the eyeballs, Abby?

21:05.031 --> 21:05.998
Well, Horlacher

21:06.032 --> 21:07.734
accessed this jpeg file

21:07.767 --> 21:08.835
22 times last week.

21:08.868 --> 21:11.438
ABBY:
Look familiar?

21:11.471 --> 21:12.605
TONY:
Oh... I was right.

21:12.639 --> 21:13.973
She is beautiful.

21:14.006 --> 21:16.576
How can you be
sure it's her?

21:16.609 --> 21:20.880
Because-- iris patterns are more
distinctive than fingerprints.

21:20.913 --> 21:22.349
More accurate, too, boss.

21:22.382 --> 21:23.616
ABBY:
The video is grainy,

21:23.650 --> 21:25.418
and the angles aren't perfect.
The lighting...

21:25.452 --> 21:26.819
Abby, is it her or not?

21:28.455 --> 21:29.822
It's an 80% match, Gibbs.

21:29.856 --> 21:31.791
I think we've got our girl.

21:42.535 --> 21:43.936
TONY:
A dead transsexual sailor,

21:43.970 --> 21:45.838
his spook instructor,

21:45.872 --> 21:48.341
and a pair of human eyes...
walk into a bar--

21:48.375 --> 21:50.477
what's the punch line, Kate?

21:50.510 --> 21:52.579
Whatever it is,
it involves this girl

21:52.612 --> 21:53.946
and Paraguay.

21:53.980 --> 21:55.582
That's true,

21:55.615 --> 21:57.116
but not very funny. Probie.

21:57.149 --> 21:59.018
Make me laugh.

22:01.788 --> 22:03.956
Okay.

22:03.990 --> 22:05.758
Oh, uh...

22:05.792 --> 22:07.427
Yeah, the bartender

22:07.460 --> 22:09.829
doesn't believe it,
so he asks the spook instructor,

22:09.862 --> 22:11.764
"What the hell is going on?"

22:11.798 --> 22:13.733
And the guy says, uh,

22:13.766 --> 22:16.403
"What, guy can't have a drink
with his pupils?"

22:18.037 --> 22:19.839
Nothing?

22:19.872 --> 22:21.808
Oh, come on, that
was pretty funny.

22:21.841 --> 22:23.876
You think this
is a joke, McGee?

22:23.910 --> 22:25.612
Uh, no. No, I don't, boss.

22:25.645 --> 22:26.846
Good answer.

22:26.879 --> 22:28.515
Tony, you're with
me in MTAC.

22:28.548 --> 22:30.683
Kate, get Purcell in here;
we need to talk.

22:30.717 --> 22:32.385
( McGee sighs )

22:32.419 --> 22:33.686
He hates me, doesn't he?

22:33.720 --> 22:35.087
KATE:
Well, "hate's" a
pretty strong word.

22:35.121 --> 22:38.157
More like a
mild dislike.
You did spill his coffee.

22:38.190 --> 22:40.059
GIBBS:
Today, DiNozzo!

22:45.698 --> 22:47.867
Gibbs'll get over it.

22:47.900 --> 22:49.402
When?

22:49.436 --> 22:50.837
Well, let's see, uh,

22:50.870 --> 22:53.906
last year Tony spilled
his coffee, and, uh,

22:53.940 --> 22:56.809
he warmed up to him about,
I don't know, an hour ago,

22:56.843 --> 22:58.411
so roughly,
eight to ten months.

22:58.445 --> 22:59.679
Okay.

23:01.981 --> 23:04.651
( sighs )

23:04.684 --> 23:07.019
I got your e-mail,
Special Agent Gibbs.

23:07.053 --> 23:10.790
To tell you the truth,
I was shocked.

23:10.823 --> 23:12.992
When did you learn
to use a computer?

23:13.025 --> 23:14.894
( chuckles ):
Well, times
change, Colonel.

23:14.927 --> 23:16.829
That they do, Gunny.

23:16.863 --> 23:18.898
I got two grandkids now.
( chuckles )

23:18.931 --> 23:20.900
I heard you got
remarried again.

23:20.933 --> 23:22.168
Uh...

23:22.201 --> 23:23.536
( laughs ):
That didn't work out.

23:23.570 --> 23:26.473
Well, then, again, some
things don't change.
( laughs )

23:26.506 --> 23:29.175
How can the Southern Command
help you today?

23:29.208 --> 23:30.443
I'm investigating

23:30.477 --> 23:34.113
a civilian contractor
working out of the
Tri-Border Area,

23:34.146 --> 23:35.515
Paraguay.

23:35.548 --> 23:36.616
Name?

23:36.649 --> 23:38.150
Guyman Purcell.

23:38.184 --> 23:40.487
Yeah, I heard of him.

23:40.520 --> 23:42.855
Oh, yeah, he's part of a TAT,

23:42.889 --> 23:46.459
Tactical Analysis Team,
we have in Ciudad del Este.

23:46.493 --> 23:47.860
What's your interest in him?

23:47.894 --> 23:50.129
One of his students committed
suicide after receiving

23:50.162 --> 23:53.132
a pair of female eyeballs
in the mail from TBA.

23:53.165 --> 23:55.902
We think Purcell
knew the victim.

23:55.935 --> 24:01.474
Body parts in the mail
generally denote a kidnap,

24:01.508 --> 24:04.143
but eyes?
( chuckles ):
Well, yeah, it, uh,

24:04.176 --> 24:06.679
does send a hell
of a message, sir.

24:06.713 --> 24:09.949
Someone's putting pressure
on Purcell? Uh, why?

24:09.982 --> 24:12.118
That's what I want
to find out.

24:12.151 --> 24:14.954
Our TATs work with
a few other agencies,

24:14.987 --> 24:16.956
and they're not always
as forthcoming

24:16.989 --> 24:18.591
with information
as I would like.

24:18.625 --> 24:19.759
But, uh,

24:19.792 --> 24:21.260
when's that ever stopped us?

24:21.293 --> 24:23.496
To old times, Gunny.

24:23.530 --> 24:25.131
GIBBS:
Old times, Skipper,

24:25.164 --> 24:27.867
old times.

24:27.900 --> 24:29.135
What's that
supposed to mean?

24:29.168 --> 24:31.003
You ask me again
in seven years.

24:31.037 --> 24:32.071
Why seven years?

24:32.104 --> 24:35.141
That's when the Freedom
of Information Act kicks in.

24:38.645 --> 24:41.548
You know that
doesn't work with me.

24:41.581 --> 24:44.050
I always know...
when you're there!

24:47.587 --> 24:49.756
( fast beeping )
Gibbs?

24:52.959 --> 24:55.094
That's weird.

24:57.196 --> 24:59.165
You looking for me?

24:59.198 --> 25:02.902
You are getting sneakier
the older you get.

25:02.935 --> 25:05.204
Not to mention better-looking.
What do you got?

25:05.237 --> 25:07.874
Well, I'm still hacking
the Petty Officer's files,

25:07.907 --> 25:09.208
but I uncovered

25:09.241 --> 25:12.244
some e-mails
you'll be interested in.

25:12.278 --> 25:14.747
I back-traced the ISP
they were sent from.

25:14.781 --> 25:18.851
It's a Web server
in Puerto Iguazú,
Argentina.

25:18.885 --> 25:20.052
The Tri-Border Area.

25:20.086 --> 25:21.754
Sí.

25:21.788 --> 25:23.890
McGEE:
Escopeta 794.

25:23.923 --> 25:25.825
It's the originator
in Argentina, boss.

25:25.858 --> 25:28.260
"Escopeta" means
"rifle" in Spanish.

25:28.294 --> 25:30.763
McGEE:
And Shadegirl is one
of Petty Officer Horlacher's

25:30.797 --> 25:31.731
private e-mail addresses.

25:31.764 --> 25:35.835
You be the transsexual;
I'll be the rifle.

25:35.868 --> 25:37.670
McGEE:
First exchange was
three weeks ago.

25:37.704 --> 25:40.239
"I want the hundred thousand
for the girl."
Shadegirl says

25:40.272 --> 25:42.842
her controller will
pay only $60,000
and wants proof.

25:42.875 --> 25:45.011
( Latin accent ):
"One hundred thou..."

25:45.044 --> 25:46.145
( whimpers )

25:46.178 --> 25:49.048
TONY:
Escopeta repeats his demand
for $100,000,

25:49.081 --> 25:51.117
swears a bunch in Spanish.

25:51.150 --> 25:52.652
Shadegirl insists

25:52.685 --> 25:54.053
on $60,000 and proof.

25:54.086 --> 25:56.055
Swear, swear, swear,

25:56.088 --> 25:57.957
threat... swear.

25:57.990 --> 26:00.092
And finally Shadegirl
goes up to $75,000

26:00.126 --> 26:01.828
and says his controller
wants proof

26:01.861 --> 26:03.129
before the money is sent.

26:03.162 --> 26:07.133
Escopeta expresses
his displeasure... colorfully

26:07.166 --> 26:08.668
and slips up--
he uses a name.

26:08.701 --> 26:09.936
"A hundred was the price.

26:09.969 --> 26:10.970
"Tell Purcell his proof's

26:11.003 --> 26:12.371
on the way."

26:12.404 --> 26:14.841
Petty Officer Horlacher
was bearding for Purcell.

26:14.874 --> 26:16.743
How does a transsexual beard,
Probie?

26:16.776 --> 26:18.878
Proof of life
by ripping
out her eyes?

26:18.911 --> 26:21.213
I don't buy it.

26:21.247 --> 26:23.315
Escopeta's running a
kidnapping ring, boss.

26:23.349 --> 26:25.017
( phone rings )
They set examples.

26:25.051 --> 26:27.253
You either meet the price
or the person dies.

26:27.286 --> 26:29.221
Yeah. Gibbs.

26:29.255 --> 26:30.289
Purcell's gone, Gibbs.

26:30.322 --> 26:31.624
Where?

26:31.658 --> 26:33.392
Well, according
to one of his students,

26:33.425 --> 26:35.928
he was recalled
back to Paraguay.

26:35.962 --> 26:37.730
You find out
what flight he's on.

26:37.764 --> 26:40.099
Already did; his flight landed
at the Guarani International

26:40.132 --> 26:41.233
Airport 20 minutes ago.

26:41.267 --> 26:42.735
Pack your gear.

26:42.769 --> 26:44.937
You're going
to Paraguay.
Alone?

26:44.971 --> 26:46.105
Take one of
'em with you.

26:46.138 --> 26:48.140
I'll start prepping
the op from here.

26:48.174 --> 26:50.409
Yes! I've always wanted
to go to Paraguay.

26:50.442 --> 26:54.080
Ha-ha!

27:01.020 --> 27:03.690
Okay, which way to the Tactical
Analysis Team's headquarters?

27:06.726 --> 27:08.094
Right.

27:08.127 --> 27:10.730
TONY:
Derecho.

27:10.763 --> 27:11.998
Aw, I should've
brought more cash.

27:12.031 --> 27:13.032
Look at that.

27:14.200 --> 27:16.035
Hey, look at these guys.

27:17.036 --> 27:18.304
Buenos dias.

27:18.337 --> 27:20.206
It's the local bridge club.

27:20.239 --> 27:22.374
Well, it's not the tropics,

27:22.408 --> 27:23.843
but at least it's warm.

27:23.876 --> 27:25.377
Actually, it is
the tropics, Tony.

27:25.411 --> 27:27.113
Really?
The Tropic
of Capricorn,

27:27.146 --> 27:30.049
to be exact.
Huh.

27:30.082 --> 27:32.084
Tropics smell kind of
funny to you, Kate?

27:32.118 --> 27:34.220
It's not the tropics, Tony.

27:34.253 --> 27:35.988
It'd be the plumbing.

27:36.022 --> 27:37.123
( Tony groans )

27:37.156 --> 27:39.992
How come we never
get sent to, like,

27:40.026 --> 27:41.293
Paris or Hawaii?

27:41.327 --> 27:43.229
KATE ( laughs ):
Oh, come on,

27:43.262 --> 27:44.430
it'll be fun.

27:44.463 --> 27:46.132
And the best part?

27:46.165 --> 27:48.267
No Gibbs checking up on us.

27:54.206 --> 27:56.042
What the hell are they doing?

27:56.075 --> 27:57.443
They're stopped
about 50 feet

27:57.476 --> 27:59.378
from the TAT building.
Well, yeah,

27:59.411 --> 28:01.814
I can see that, McGee.
Get them on the satellite phone.

28:01.848 --> 28:04.483
TONY:
Check it out, Kate.

28:04.516 --> 28:07.019
iPod for 30 bucks.

28:07.053 --> 28:08.988
KATE:
First of all, it says

28:09.021 --> 28:10.923
"L-Pod" on the back.

28:10.957 --> 28:14.727
And second-- there's
nothing in here.

28:16.028 --> 28:17.296
( phone rings )

28:17.329 --> 28:19.031
DiNozzo.
What's your
location?

28:19.065 --> 28:20.066
We're looking for

28:20.099 --> 28:21.333
the TAT building right now.

28:21.367 --> 28:22.769
Town's kind of hard

28:22.802 --> 28:25.104
to navigate.
It's 50 feet

28:25.137 --> 28:26.205
right in front of you, DiNozzo.

28:28.540 --> 28:30.777
TONY:
Found it.
I take it the GPS chip

28:30.810 --> 28:32.111
in the phone
is working well?

28:32.144 --> 28:33.345
Well, yes, it is.

28:33.379 --> 28:35.915
Will you quit screwing around
and get moving?!

28:35.948 --> 28:37.116
You're not on vacation.

28:37.149 --> 28:38.450
On it, boss.

28:38.484 --> 28:39.919
Patch me into
Colonel Bushnell.

28:39.952 --> 28:40.953
On it.

28:40.987 --> 28:42.789
Switch over to
Southern Command.

28:46.258 --> 28:49.796
Colonel Bushnell,
our team's at the linkup point.

28:49.829 --> 28:52.264
Their in-country guide
is Joe Tabarez.

28:52.298 --> 28:55.401
He's the watch officer
for the Ciudad del Este TAT.

28:55.434 --> 28:57.436
Former Marine. Good man.

28:57.469 --> 28:59.071
Any word on Purcell?

28:59.105 --> 29:00.539
Not since
he came through customs.

29:00.572 --> 29:02.942
He hasn't checked in
with any of our people.

29:02.975 --> 29:05.511
He's not in Paraguay
on Southcom business.

29:05.544 --> 29:08.214
What about somebody else's
business, Colonel?

29:08.247 --> 29:09.782
Now, that's possible.

29:09.816 --> 29:11.450
I'm checking that angle now.

29:11.483 --> 29:14.120
I know somebody higher up
in the chain of command

29:14.153 --> 29:17.189
is not making this easy, Jethro.

29:17.223 --> 29:19.425
( sighs ):
Yeah.

29:23.595 --> 29:25.231
Agents DiNozzo and Todd?

29:25.264 --> 29:28.234
I'm Joe Tabarez,
Tactical Analysis Team.

29:28.267 --> 29:30.436
Welcome to the
middle of nowhere.

29:30.469 --> 29:32.004
Nice to meet you.

29:32.038 --> 29:34.240
What's the chain for?

29:34.273 --> 29:36.242
Ciudad del Este
anti-theft device.

29:36.275 --> 29:38.144
Let's get inside.

29:38.177 --> 29:39.912
Don't want to get shot
on your first day.

29:39.946 --> 29:42.014
( groans )
Maldito perro.

29:43.615 --> 29:45.885
This is the Wild West.

29:45.918 --> 29:48.988
If there's a profit in
something, it's for sale.

29:49.021 --> 29:51.157
Bootlegs, drugs, guns,
you name it.

29:51.190 --> 29:53.059
It's also Al-Qaeda's
front line

29:53.092 --> 29:54.393
in South America.

29:54.426 --> 29:56.829
What about body parts?

29:56.863 --> 29:58.564
Well, there's folks
down here who'd sell you

29:58.597 --> 30:01.834
a kidney if it meant
putting food on the table.

30:01.868 --> 30:03.970
Of course, there's also folks
who'd gladly take yours

30:04.003 --> 30:06.105
for the same reason, Agent Todd.

30:06.138 --> 30:08.174
Tell us about Purcell.

30:08.207 --> 30:10.409
His intelligence work
is first-rate.

30:10.442 --> 30:13.279
Man's developed a lot
of contacts down here.

30:13.312 --> 30:16.048
Well, what do you think of him
personally,

30:16.082 --> 30:18.484
Mr. Tabarez?
Oh, it's Joe,

30:18.517 --> 30:20.452
and I try not to.

30:20.486 --> 30:24.290
Off the record, Purcell's
one creepy son of a bitch.

30:24.323 --> 30:26.025
What's he supposed to have done?

30:26.058 --> 30:27.026
TONY:
Shipped a pair

30:27.059 --> 30:28.995
of women's eyeballs
to a transsexual sailor

30:29.028 --> 30:30.897
who killed himself.

30:30.930 --> 30:32.965
And here I thought
I'd seen it all.

30:35.301 --> 30:37.503
TONY:
You recognize
the girl on the right?

30:38.637 --> 30:40.039
TABAREZ:
I do.

30:40.072 --> 30:42.241
It's Purcell's wife.

30:44.210 --> 30:46.278
( sighs )

30:51.250 --> 30:52.985
We ID'd the girl
in the photo, boss.

30:53.019 --> 30:54.553
Name's Anna Real.

30:54.586 --> 30:57.289
Purcell married her
last year in Paraguay.

30:57.323 --> 30:59.625
How old is she?

30:59.658 --> 31:00.626
Seventeen.

31:00.659 --> 31:03.529
And he's been "dating" her
for about three years.

31:03.562 --> 31:05.898
KATE:
The bastard's
a pedophile, Gibbs.

31:05.932 --> 31:07.633
Tabarez knew this?

31:07.666 --> 31:10.002
Well, he's the one
who told us.

31:10.036 --> 31:11.637
I want to talk to him.

31:11.670 --> 31:13.305
He's out trying
to find Purcell.

31:13.339 --> 31:15.474
Or he's having coffee with him.

31:15.507 --> 31:17.309
He looked the other way

31:17.343 --> 31:20.212
while Purcell was molesting
a 14-year-old.

31:20.246 --> 31:22.481
What's that tell you two?

31:24.350 --> 31:26.252
Get me Bushnell.

31:26.285 --> 31:27.353
On it.

31:27.386 --> 31:30.556
You two find me Purcell.

31:35.227 --> 31:36.963
I wasn't having
coffee with him.

31:36.996 --> 31:38.330
But I know who was.

31:44.603 --> 31:47.306
Did you report him
to Southern Command?

31:47.339 --> 31:48.640
Yes, Agent Todd,

31:48.674 --> 31:50.309
I did.

31:50.342 --> 31:53.545
Look, if I had my way,
he'd by lying in the garbage

31:53.579 --> 31:56.015
there on the street.

31:56.048 --> 31:58.150
But he's being protected.

31:58.184 --> 32:00.152
By who?

32:00.186 --> 32:01.587
Need to know.

32:01.620 --> 32:03.489
I don't.

32:03.522 --> 32:05.691
Welcome to the wonderful
world of spooks.

32:05.724 --> 32:09.161
Who was he having
coffee with?

32:11.230 --> 32:14.733
Are you ready to see
the seedy underside
of Ciudad del Este?

32:14.766 --> 32:16.268
Can it get any worse?

32:16.302 --> 32:17.569
( groans, chuckles )

32:17.603 --> 32:21.340
BUSHNELL:
You believe I would look
the other way, Gunny?

32:21.373 --> 32:25.677
No, Skipper, but someone
in Southern Command did.

32:25.711 --> 32:29.281
Well, I'll find out who,
and I'll get back to you.

32:29.315 --> 32:33.052
I'm gonna take him down,
Colonel.

32:33.085 --> 32:35.988
Just make sure you don't
get taken down, Jethro.

32:36.022 --> 32:40.059
Special Agent McGee
here's got my back.

32:40.092 --> 32:42.128
Yeah, right.

32:46.265 --> 32:48.200
( laughs )

32:48.234 --> 32:51.103
Thank you.
Thank you, boss.

32:51.137 --> 32:54.006
What the hell
are you doing?

32:54.040 --> 32:56.542
Wha... I thought that
you were giving it to me.

32:56.575 --> 32:59.011
To refill it, McGee!

32:59.045 --> 33:01.313
Sorry, I'll get
you another one.

33:13.659 --> 33:15.161
Estas arestado.

33:17.463 --> 33:18.697
Ah, Joe!

33:18.730 --> 33:20.766
Why you always
doing this to me?!

33:20.799 --> 33:22.301
Practicing, Iggy.

33:22.334 --> 33:25.071
I've got some friends here
who want to talk to you.

33:25.104 --> 33:26.805
Oh, sure, you like movies, eh?

33:26.838 --> 33:29.408
Movies? No habla Ingles?

33:29.441 --> 33:30.742
I have DVDs.

33:30.776 --> 33:32.278
Only five American each, huh?

33:32.311 --> 33:34.380
$5 for a DVD?

33:34.413 --> 33:36.548
You drive a hard bargain, man.
Only four for you.

33:36.582 --> 33:38.350
Four bucks? Any Hitchcock?

33:38.384 --> 33:39.785
I have everything,
my friend.

33:39.818 --> 33:41.287
I have action,
I have the comedy.

33:41.320 --> 33:42.388
I have whatever you want.

33:42.421 --> 33:44.090
Actually, we're
more interested

33:44.123 --> 33:45.791
in information, Iggy.

33:45.824 --> 33:47.193
You like handbags, Miss?

33:47.226 --> 33:48.327
Oh...

33:48.360 --> 33:49.495
Oh.

33:49.528 --> 33:51.163
Louis Vuitton!

33:51.197 --> 33:52.531
Wow, looks so real.

33:52.564 --> 33:53.532
Uh-huh.

33:53.565 --> 33:55.301
$20. Or two
for $40.

33:55.334 --> 33:56.302
Really?

33:56.335 --> 33:57.803
Like the lady said,

33:57.836 --> 34:01.807
we're more interested
in information, Iggy.

34:01.840 --> 34:04.710
Seen the girl on
the right before?

34:06.378 --> 34:07.346
Ah, sí.

34:07.379 --> 34:08.814
Tell me
about her.

34:08.847 --> 34:09.815
Hey...

34:09.848 --> 34:11.817
I heard she passed.

34:11.850 --> 34:13.519
By "passed,"

34:13.552 --> 34:15.854
you mean she had her eyeballs
ripped out of her skull?

34:15.887 --> 34:17.456
Yeah, Iggy, she passed.

34:17.489 --> 34:20.326
We want to know
who did it and why.

34:20.359 --> 34:23.629
Life is so cheap here, Miss,
oh, who can say why?

34:23.662 --> 34:25.464
Purcell can.

34:25.497 --> 34:27.133
Seen him around lately?

34:29.368 --> 34:31.637
Señor Purcell, he's...
he's a good man.

34:31.670 --> 34:33.105
JOE:
That's not what
he asked, Iggy.

34:33.139 --> 34:35.241
He wants to know
if you've seen him.

34:35.274 --> 34:36.708
IGGY:
No.

34:36.742 --> 34:38.777
Why, is he in trouble or what?

34:38.810 --> 34:41.213
( phone rings )

34:41.247 --> 34:42.514
( phone beeps )

34:42.548 --> 34:44.183
Todd.

34:44.216 --> 34:46.152
Es un satellite phone?
Oye...

34:46.185 --> 34:47.286
KATE:
Great.

34:47.319 --> 34:48.320
Thanks, McGee.

34:48.354 --> 34:49.655
He found us a hotel.

34:49.688 --> 34:51.423
Good. We need to find Purcell.

34:51.457 --> 34:53.225
You help us, we'll help you.

34:53.259 --> 34:54.025
How much for the phone?

34:54.059 --> 34:55.361
KATE:
Phone's not
for sale.

34:55.394 --> 34:56.628
Come on. Okay.

34:56.662 --> 34:58.697
We trade, no?
All of this, plus

34:58.730 --> 35:01.500
$50 U.S. Come on!

35:01.533 --> 35:03.669
It's government property issued
to me, not for sale.

35:03.702 --> 35:04.503
I'll tell you
what, Iggy.

35:04.536 --> 35:07.539
I'll give you the phone
if you promise

35:07.573 --> 35:09.308
to tell me when
Purcell contacts you.

35:09.341 --> 35:10.509
What?! You're
not authorized

35:10.542 --> 35:11.677
to give him my phone.
Agent Todd,

35:11.710 --> 35:13.412
you are interrupting
my negotiation.

35:17.416 --> 35:18.817
Deal?

35:18.850 --> 35:22.521
Sí. If Purcell contacts me,

35:22.554 --> 35:23.222
I tell you.

35:23.255 --> 35:25.557
Phone number's
on the back.

35:27.893 --> 35:30.562
McGEE:
It's a great idea, Tony.
GPS in Kate's phone

35:30.596 --> 35:32.364
is reading loud and clear.

35:32.398 --> 35:33.765
I'll call when Iggy moves.

35:33.799 --> 35:36.268
TONY ( on phone ):
Roger that, Probie.

35:39.605 --> 35:42.374
So you want me to say
sorry or something?

35:44.610 --> 35:46.578
You could have given him
your phone, you know?

35:46.612 --> 35:48.947
The lead agent never gives up
his line of communication.

35:48.980 --> 35:50.616
Oh, when did you
become the lead agent?

35:50.649 --> 35:51.950
I thought
we were a team.

35:51.983 --> 35:53.819
We are. I'm the team leader.

35:55.387 --> 35:57.456
What, so I'm the follower?

35:57.489 --> 35:59.425
( door opening )

35:59.458 --> 36:00.826
I don't think so.

36:00.859 --> 36:03.595
Oh, yeah, I've seen
that look before.

36:03.629 --> 36:05.597
Bosnia.

36:05.631 --> 36:08.467
When we returned
to Brcko,

36:08.500 --> 36:10.736
two days after NATO
ordered us out.

36:10.769 --> 36:13.272
I can still smell it burning.

36:13.305 --> 36:17.543
I have been given a direct order
to protect Purcell

36:17.576 --> 36:19.511
as a valuable
intelligence asset.

36:19.545 --> 36:20.912
Regardless of what he's done?

36:20.946 --> 36:23.515
Regardless of what he has done.

36:23.549 --> 36:24.916
With all due respect, Colonel...

36:24.950 --> 36:27.386
You don't have to say it, Gunny!

36:29.621 --> 36:31.557
There are only two things
a Marine can do

36:31.590 --> 36:32.958
when he receives a direct order:

36:32.991 --> 36:35.594
obey or resign.

36:35.627 --> 36:38.264
You're resigning
your commission?

36:40.432 --> 36:43.635
I will never have another Brcko
on my conscience.

36:46.338 --> 36:48.440
GIBBS:
Can you find out
who's protecting him?

36:48.474 --> 36:50.576
Someone at the farm,

36:50.609 --> 36:52.544
but I have no way
of knowing who it is.

36:52.578 --> 36:54.280
Sir, how do you
contact him?

36:54.313 --> 36:56.782
Encrypted teleconference
like this.

36:56.815 --> 36:58.317
GIBBS:
You've seen him?

36:58.350 --> 37:00.586
No. He's always in shadow.

37:00.619 --> 37:02.521
Very corny, like some

37:02.554 --> 37:04.022
Cold War film.

37:04.055 --> 37:05.824
That's corny,
but it's effective.

37:05.857 --> 37:06.825
Yeah.

37:06.858 --> 37:08.560
Boss, if...
if-if the Colonel

37:08.594 --> 37:10.296
can get him on
a teleconference,

37:10.329 --> 37:12.664
his encrypter can
patch him to us.

37:14.600 --> 37:16.602
Skipper.

37:23.442 --> 37:25.511
TONY:
Where the hell are we, McGee?

37:25.544 --> 37:28.714
McGEE:
San Gusta Street,
near the heart of the city.

37:28.747 --> 37:29.881
Okay, he's turning left.

37:29.915 --> 37:30.916
I know he turned left.

37:30.949 --> 37:32.584
I have a visual.

37:32.618 --> 37:34.453
KATE:
He's stopping up ahead.

37:35.921 --> 37:38.424
TONY:
Who's he with?

37:44.029 --> 37:45.697
KATE:
Purcell!

37:45.731 --> 37:47.633
TONY:
Okay, it's Purcell.
Shall we bring him in, boss?

37:47.666 --> 37:48.634
No.

37:48.667 --> 37:49.635
What?

37:49.668 --> 37:51.637
No, DiNozzo. You heard me.

37:51.670 --> 37:53.572
Just tail him.

37:55.006 --> 37:56.642
Gibbs wants us to follow him.

37:56.675 --> 37:58.444
Why?

37:58.477 --> 37:59.711
Does it matter?

38:07.753 --> 38:09.621
TONY:
They're heading into a hotel,
boss.

38:09.655 --> 38:11.723
Follow.

38:11.757 --> 38:13.625
Don't engage
unless you have to.

38:16.595 --> 38:17.929
Iggy's altitude is increasing.

38:20.966 --> 38:23.435
He's in an elevator.

38:23.469 --> 38:25.637
Third floor, DiNozzo.

38:39.918 --> 38:41.753
Going somewhere, Iggy?

38:41.787 --> 38:43.589
To find you, my friend.

38:43.622 --> 38:45.524
Señor Purcell,
he contacted me.

38:45.557 --> 38:46.525
Did he, now?
Sí.

38:46.558 --> 38:48.360
What's he doing
here, Iggy?

38:48.394 --> 38:49.528
Well, it's a hotel.

38:49.561 --> 38:50.896
He's staying here.

38:50.929 --> 38:52.698
( hammer cocking )
Wrong answer.

38:55.901 --> 39:00.472
First I want you to know
that I loved my wife...

39:00.506 --> 39:02.574
even if I couldn't trust her.

39:02.608 --> 39:05.411
I paid $75,000 American.

39:05.444 --> 39:08.079
That's a fortune down here.

39:08.113 --> 39:10.115
Why are you not dead?

39:11.750 --> 39:14.653
Escopeta confused me
with my little sister.

39:14.686 --> 39:17.823
( voice cracking ):
He killed her.

39:17.856 --> 39:21.427
She would still be alive if you
hadn't threatened to betray me.

39:23.429 --> 39:25.464
Good-bye, Anna.

39:29.801 --> 39:31.637
Do it!

39:31.670 --> 39:34.039
I'd rather be dead
than spend one more day

39:34.072 --> 39:36.442
with a monster like you!

39:39.177 --> 39:40.646
Close you eyes, Anna.

39:43.482 --> 39:45.150
Close you eyes.

39:49.788 --> 39:51.156
KATE:
Drop the weapon!

39:52.791 --> 39:55.927
Now, look at that, Kate.
He's actually thinking

39:55.961 --> 39:57.128
about trying it.

39:57.162 --> 39:59.831
You double-tap the head,
I'll double-tap the heart.
Deal.

40:07.806 --> 40:10.108
All right, stand by.

40:10.141 --> 40:13.945
My farm contact's
coming on the system...

40:13.979 --> 40:15.581
now.

40:15.614 --> 40:16.448
He's all yours, Gunny.

40:16.482 --> 40:17.449
Patch me in, McGee.

40:17.483 --> 40:18.850
( screen blips )

40:18.884 --> 40:21.887
Special Agent Gibbs, NCIS.

40:21.920 --> 40:25.957
GIBBS:
You either give
up Purcell...

40:25.991 --> 40:27.759
or I will
personally
compromise

40:27.793 --> 40:29.561
the identity
of this man,

40:29.595 --> 40:31.897
Ari Haswari.

40:31.930 --> 40:35.200
Our link to Al Qaeda...

40:35.233 --> 40:37.869
or a child molester?

40:37.903 --> 40:39.738
Your call.

40:41.673 --> 40:42.674
( screen blips )

40:45.644 --> 40:47.646
What next?

40:47.679 --> 40:49.815
Now we wait, McGee.

40:51.950 --> 40:55.621
TONY:
According to
your... "wife,"

40:55.654 --> 40:57.489
you're not just
getting intel

40:57.523 --> 40:59.625
on rackets
in Ciudad Del Este,

40:59.658 --> 41:02.227
you're running
some of them.

41:02.260 --> 41:04.896
Drugs,
organ harvesting,

41:04.930 --> 41:06.998
child prostitution rings?

41:07.032 --> 41:08.934
It's my mission

41:08.967 --> 41:10.902
to infiltrate
these organizations.

41:10.936 --> 41:12.938
I'm very good at it.

41:14.039 --> 41:17.643
And having sex
with underage children?

41:20.045 --> 41:21.547
TONY:
Once she testifies,

41:21.580 --> 41:23.281
you're gonna spend
the rest of your life

41:23.314 --> 41:24.716
in Leavenworth, Purcell.

41:24.750 --> 41:26.752
No, no,
you misunderstand,

41:26.785 --> 41:28.219
Agent DiNozzo.

41:28.253 --> 41:30.789
Anna wasn't threatening
to tell our government.

41:30.822 --> 41:33.559
She was threatening
to tell hers.

41:33.592 --> 41:35.861
What difference does that make?

41:35.894 --> 41:38.063
( wry chuckle )

41:38.096 --> 41:39.531
( door opening )

41:39.565 --> 41:41.700
( wry chuckle )

41:41.733 --> 41:43.168
( keys jangling )

41:43.201 --> 41:45.837
You should have shot him while
you had the chance, DiNozzo.

41:45.871 --> 41:47.205
What...

41:47.238 --> 41:48.273
You know what he is,

41:48.306 --> 41:49.207
what he did.

41:49.240 --> 41:50.609
How could you?

41:50.642 --> 41:51.376
Same way you do.

41:51.409 --> 41:53.745
Following orders,
Agent Todd.

41:56.281 --> 41:58.083
Now, if you'll
excuse me,

41:58.116 --> 42:00.952
I have a job to do.

42:06.291 --> 42:08.293
Boss, there's another
encrypted transmission

42:08.326 --> 42:09.595
coming over the system.

42:09.628 --> 42:10.629
Put it up on the screen.

42:10.662 --> 42:12.731
( screen blips )

42:27.713 --> 42:31.850
( humming happy tune )

42:31.883 --> 42:33.184
( gunshot )

42:33.218 --> 42:34.552
( screen blips )

42:41.226 --> 42:54.105
Bring our people home.
