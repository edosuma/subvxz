WEBVTT

00:02.245 --> 00:05.146
Okay, the central question that the senators
are gonna be asking is,

00:05.437 --> 00:07.638
"Why should we invest in
the National Parks Service?"

00:07.672 --> 00:09.540
- April...
- Well, it is simple, Leslie.

00:09.574 --> 00:11.075
In today's fast-paced society,

00:11.109 --> 00:12.876
national parks are still
the best place

00:12.911 --> 00:15.312
for full moon
werewolf transformations.

00:15.347 --> 00:16.312
I know you're kidding.

00:16.347 --> 00:17.748
But I also know that
you're prepared

00:17.749 --> 00:19.416
and we are going to do great.

00:19.451 --> 00:20.851
How psyched are you
about this trip?

00:20.885 --> 00:23.587
April, are you super psyched?

00:23.622 --> 00:26.123
Yeah. Also you have
lipstick on your teeth.

00:26.157 --> 00:27.791
I do? Mm, okay.
Good looking out.

00:27.826 --> 00:29.026
We're a great team.

00:29.060 --> 00:30.694
Well, I never thought
I'd say this,

00:30.729 --> 00:33.464
but I think I know
what's going on in your head.

00:33.498 --> 00:36.467
Oh, well then,
welcome to the terror dome.

00:36.501 --> 00:39.403
Okay, you need to tell Leslie
that you want to leave your job.

00:39.437 --> 00:42.406
No. She freaks out
when anything changes.

00:42.440 --> 00:44.441
One time Andy told her that
I was getting rid of my bangs

00:44.476 --> 00:45.843
and she called 9-1-1.

00:45.877 --> 00:47.645
Okay, well, I can't
keep your secret much longer.

00:47.679 --> 00:49.680
Anytime your name comes up,
I panic

00:49.714 --> 00:51.949
and change the subject to
the <i> Twin Peaks </i> reboot

00:51.983 --> 00:53.217
'til she gets bored.

00:53.251 --> 00:54.551
So you talk for one second?

00:54.586 --> 00:56.387
You're gonna spend
the next couple days with her.

00:56.421 --> 00:58.489
If you talk to her
directly and honestly,

00:58.523 --> 01:00.758
she can be
surprisingly open-minded.

01:00.792 --> 01:01.959
Oh, really? Oh, okay.

01:01.993 --> 01:04.093
Hey, Leslie, um, I was
thinking about changing

01:04.129 --> 01:05.563
the font on the itineraries.

01:05.597 --> 01:06.597
What do you think?

01:06.631 --> 01:07.965
What? Why?

01:07.999 --> 01:10.134
On what grounds?
Those--those fonts are perfect.

01:10.168 --> 01:12.603
It's readable and compact,
it's all on one page.

01:12.637 --> 01:14.438
That's insane.
Don't mess with that.

01:14.472 --> 01:16.473
I mean, I appreciate
your initiative,

01:16.508 --> 01:20.244
but itineraries are not
the right place to mess around.

01:20.278 --> 01:24.248
Yeah. April, I told you,
that was an absurd idea.

01:27.219 --> 01:35.226

01:44.769 --> 01:46.403
I don't care what Ben says.

01:46.438 --> 01:48.205
I'm not going to tell Leslie
I'm leaving my job

01:48.240 --> 01:50.841
on this trip. She'll drown me
in the Potomac...

01:50.875 --> 01:52.877
while she recites facts
about the Potomac.

01:52.911 --> 01:55.346
Well don't fret, cookie.
We've made progress, haven't we?

01:55.380 --> 01:57.548
We got a whole list of all
the things you need

01:57.582 --> 01:58.883
out of a new job.

01:58.917 --> 02:01.752
Apple juice, barbeque sauce,

02:01.787 --> 02:03.220
Count Chocula--
wait.

02:03.255 --> 02:05.135
Oh, sorry, that's the list
of cool new nicknames

02:05.156 --> 02:06.190
I want people to call me.

02:06.224 --> 02:07.992
Here's your list.

02:08.026 --> 02:09.126
How can I tell her I'm leaving

02:09.161 --> 02:11.027
when I don't even know
what job I want?

02:11.062 --> 02:13.797
Babe, I wish you
were coming with me.

02:13.832 --> 02:15.332
I just decided what
I am going to do

02:15.367 --> 02:16.448
while April is out of town.

02:16.502 --> 02:19.304
I'm going to round up the team
and find her a new job.

02:19.338 --> 02:21.006
Yeah, Ben Wyatt please?

02:21.040 --> 02:25.143
Tell him it's Count Chocula.

02:25.177 --> 02:27.879
Uh, no it's Andrew Dwyer.
I'm sorry.

02:27.913 --> 02:29.447
So April wants to leave?

02:29.482 --> 02:33.018
I always knew she
would tire of government.

02:33.052 --> 02:34.185
Took long enough.

02:34.220 --> 02:35.253
Well, both me and Ben

02:35.288 --> 02:36.721
are trying to help April
find a new job,

02:36.756 --> 02:38.290
and we thought maybe
she could work for you.

02:38.324 --> 02:41.326
I feel like it would be
a perfect fit.

02:41.360 --> 02:43.995
Although, I don't know exactly
what you guys do here.

02:44.030 --> 02:46.865
I'm guessing...

02:46.899 --> 02:48.066
it's a business?

02:48.100 --> 02:50.535
Assassins? Hit men?

02:50.570 --> 02:52.604
Doctors. You guys
are doctors.

02:52.638 --> 02:54.439
We build things.

02:54.473 --> 02:56.408
Come on, let me show you around.

02:56.442 --> 03:00.979
This is a door.
These, of course, are walls.

03:01.013 --> 03:03.014
What else?
What else? Ah!

03:03.049 --> 03:05.116
Meet our Vice President,
Don Swanson.

03:05.151 --> 03:06.551
Don, this is Andrew
and Benjamin.

03:06.586 --> 03:07.852
Pleasure to meet you.

03:07.887 --> 03:10.655
Is this your brother?

03:10.690 --> 03:13.091
You have a brother.

03:13.125 --> 03:15.193
No.

03:15.227 --> 03:18.597
Fine. Yes. I suppose
the cat's out of the bag.

03:18.631 --> 03:21.533
I have a brother.
One brother.

03:21.567 --> 03:23.301
All those years together
at the Parks department

03:23.336 --> 03:24.936
and you never told us
you had a brother.

03:24.971 --> 03:26.104
You worked at
the Parks department?

03:26.138 --> 03:27.806
Tour's over!

03:27.840 --> 03:31.810
Okay. Carry-on bag's packed.
Trashy magazines purchased.

03:31.844 --> 03:35.113
Boarding passes in hand,
and we have 26 minutes

03:35.147 --> 03:36.915
for unstructured chat time.

03:36.949 --> 03:37.983
What do you want to talk about?

03:38.017 --> 03:40.485
I don't know.
Nothing.

03:40.519 --> 03:42.520
I thought maybe we could
talk about your future.

03:42.555 --> 03:45.290
Wanna talk about your future?

03:45.324 --> 03:47.859
Yeah. I've actually been
thinking about that

03:47.893 --> 03:49.461
- a lot lately.
- Yeah, I figured.

03:49.495 --> 03:51.963
It's hard, at your age,
to figure out your path.

03:51.998 --> 03:53.198
- I know.
- Yeah.

03:53.232 --> 03:54.899
I was gonna surprise you
with this in Washington,

03:54.934 --> 03:55.967
but, you know, what the heck?

03:56.002 --> 03:57.535
It's unstructured chat time.

03:57.570 --> 04:00.338
So...
ta-da!

04:00.373 --> 04:03.108
This is your clear,
definitive path

04:03.142 --> 04:04.276
through the federal government.

04:04.310 --> 04:07.045
It starts here today
with this flight

04:07.079 --> 04:09.014
and it goes all the way to 2022.

04:09.048 --> 04:10.281
Cool, right?

04:10.316 --> 04:12.284
Wow. This is intense.

04:12.318 --> 04:14.019
I had to make some guesses about

04:14.053 --> 04:15.720
your ultimate government
objectives

04:15.755 --> 04:17.689
and your fashion choices,
etcetera,

04:17.723 --> 04:19.491
but the point is with this

04:19.524 --> 04:20.992
you don't have to worry.

04:21.027 --> 04:23.728
I know!
I feel so relaxed.

04:23.763 --> 04:24.996
Yeah! I know!

04:25.031 --> 04:27.565
What's up with these shirts?

04:27.600 --> 04:28.900
Gov Buds for Life?

04:28.935 --> 04:30.969
Just a little fun I was having,
you know?

04:31.003 --> 04:33.805
I didn't really make the shirts.

04:33.839 --> 04:35.006
But did you though?

04:35.041 --> 04:37.575
Yes, I did!

04:37.610 --> 04:39.878
Ha-ha! Ta-da!

04:40.980 --> 04:43.548
Oh, and also,
I have a middle seat.

04:43.668 --> 04:47.619
April!
Group one is boarding!

04:50.062 --> 04:52.125
Break it down. What will she be
doing at this job?

04:52.226 --> 04:54.623
Well, she'd have about six
people reporting to her.

04:54.743 --> 04:56.777
And if she started soon,
she could project manage

04:56.812 --> 04:58.479
our new warehouse in Snerling.

04:58.513 --> 05:00.614
Get to be my own boss.
So far, so good.

05:00.649 --> 05:04.618
She also wants passionate
interest in subject matter.

05:04.653 --> 05:07.254
So, what kind of building is it?

05:07.289 --> 05:08.956
It's a large scale storage unit

05:08.990 --> 05:10.658
for surplus vinyl sheeting.

05:10.692 --> 05:14.028
Okay. So that's, uh,
boring.

05:14.062 --> 05:15.996
Would she have
an opportunity to practice

05:16.031 --> 05:17.932
any creative problem solving?

05:17.966 --> 05:21.869
Creativity is for people
with glasses who like to lie.

05:21.903 --> 05:24.839
Although, I suppose she could
use creative ways

05:24.873 --> 05:27.408
to organize and stack
the vinyl sheeting.

05:27.442 --> 05:28.876
No, that's insane.

05:28.910 --> 05:31.512
We use the Towsend method.
It's tried and true.

05:31.546 --> 05:33.214
I think this might
be a dead end.

05:33.248 --> 05:34.815
I think you might be right.

05:34.850 --> 05:36.584
But getting a good person
out of government

05:36.618 --> 05:38.285
is a worthwhile endeavor.

05:38.320 --> 05:40.755
I will help, but first
I'm gonna need some grub.

05:40.789 --> 05:43.090
Ooh, yeah! Let's grab some
lunch and some ice cream!

05:43.125 --> 05:44.825
Then maybe some
after ice cream tacos?

05:44.860 --> 05:46.780
We'll just brainstorm and
maybe grab some snacks.

05:46.795 --> 05:48.129
Vaughn, Lon.

05:48.163 --> 05:49.330
Ron.

05:52.434 --> 05:54.468
Okay, I think we're all set.

05:54.503 --> 05:55.803
Even though I'm taking the lead
on these meetings,

05:55.837 --> 05:57.271
- don't be afraid to jump in.
- Copy that.

05:57.305 --> 05:59.707
April, when Randy brings up
the river project,

05:59.741 --> 06:01.976
- that is your cue to--
- Distract the guards

06:02.010 --> 06:05.079
so the Hamburglar can
make his escape.

06:05.113 --> 06:07.281
We're meeting with
a lot of senators today.

06:07.315 --> 06:08.516
- Is she going to be okay?
- Yeah.

06:08.550 --> 06:11.118
It's just April.
Trust me.

06:11.153 --> 06:13.821
And we hope you agree that
this is the best plan

06:13.855 --> 06:15.022
to preserve
national parks' funding

06:15.056 --> 06:16.690
into the next decade.

06:16.725 --> 06:18.086
Well, so Leslie,
what do you think?

06:18.093 --> 06:19.660
Is--is this the right move?

06:19.694 --> 06:21.695
Well, I think it's the only
move, Senator Boxer.

06:21.730 --> 06:24.732
I don't think this chance
is gonna come around again.

06:24.766 --> 06:27.268
Well, you know,
if it's good with Leslie,

06:27.302 --> 06:28.869
it's good with me.

06:28.904 --> 06:30.671
Well, I have another great idea.

06:30.705 --> 06:32.873
How about you and me,
April, Randy,

06:32.908 --> 06:34.875
historical lamp posts of D.C.?

06:34.910 --> 06:37.211
Walking tour
starts in 15 minutes.

06:37.245 --> 06:38.579
Sounds great, but, uh,

06:38.613 --> 06:41.682
I do have an appointment
with the President.

06:41.717 --> 06:42.950
Can we come?

06:44.019 --> 06:45.219
What kind of a business is this?

06:45.253 --> 06:48.222
Is it like hit men
or astronauts?

06:48.256 --> 06:50.324
It's an accounting firm.

06:50.358 --> 06:52.493
But they recently opened up
a consulting wing.

06:52.527 --> 06:54.128
And consulting is perfect
for April.

06:54.162 --> 06:56.096
You think this Barney fellow
will listen

06:56.131 --> 06:57.431
to what we have to say?

06:57.466 --> 06:59.300
Ben! Ben is here!

06:59.334 --> 07:00.801
Hi, Ben!

07:00.836 --> 07:02.670
Ted! Ben is here!

07:02.704 --> 07:06.540
Hey, it is actuarially very good
to see you guys.

07:06.575 --> 07:08.843
Aah! Ha ha!

07:08.877 --> 07:10.077
Ben!

07:10.112 --> 07:13.214
- They like me here.
- You gotta hear this!

07:13.883 --> 07:15.293
So we think we can
keep costs down

07:15.433 --> 07:16.433
and still meet deadlines.

07:16.720 --> 07:18.187
You know, I have to say
I'm really impressed

07:18.221 --> 07:20.256
with what you guys are doing
over at Interior.

07:20.290 --> 07:21.357
Thank you, Senator Gillibrand,

07:21.391 --> 07:22.591
we really appreciate
your support.

07:22.626 --> 07:24.326
Would you mind signing
a copy of your book?

07:24.361 --> 07:25.694
Oh, of course, of course.

07:25.729 --> 07:26.795
I took the liberty of
writing the inscription.

07:26.830 --> 07:27.997
All you have to do is sign.

07:28.031 --> 07:30.799
"To Leslie, my inspiration,
my muse,

07:30.834 --> 07:33.102
my partner in crime.
I owe it all to you."

07:33.136 --> 07:35.404
And there's room for a P.S.
if you feel

07:35.438 --> 07:37.039
there's more you left out.

07:37.073 --> 07:39.508
Well, I think I've said all
I wanna say right here.

07:39.542 --> 07:41.243
- Okay.
- Okay.

07:41.278 --> 07:43.345
Yeah, well, I can't do
that right now.

07:43.380 --> 07:45.881
Oh, boy.
I'll call you back.

07:45.916 --> 07:47.983
Hello, Senator.
Do you have a minute to chat?

07:48.018 --> 07:49.518
Oh, I can't right now.
I've got a meeting.

07:49.553 --> 07:51.353
Well, actually, I checked
with your staff

07:51.388 --> 07:53.789
and they said that
you have a free half hour.

07:53.823 --> 07:55.357
Did anyone ever tell you

07:55.392 --> 07:57.726
that your tenacity
can be intimidating?

07:57.761 --> 07:59.929
Yes. Every month of my life
since fourth grade.

07:59.963 --> 08:01.931
Now, let's talk about
national parks.

08:01.965 --> 08:04.300
Well, I just have to say
I'm very surprised

08:04.334 --> 08:07.002
that the two of you are
seeing eye to eye on this one.

08:07.037 --> 08:08.737
Well, Senator Buckner and I are
both concerned

08:08.772 --> 08:10.773
about our nation's resources.

08:10.807 --> 08:13.175
And that absolutely includes
our national parks.

08:13.210 --> 08:15.244
But that's not all we
have in common.

08:15.278 --> 08:18.681
In fact, our real passion is...

08:18.715 --> 08:21.584
Polynesian folk music.

08:21.618 --> 08:23.085
W--what?

08:23.119 --> 08:24.420
Polynesian folk music.

08:24.454 --> 08:26.288
Our band is playing in
Georgetown tonight

08:26.323 --> 08:27.299
if you'd like to come.

08:27.447 --> 08:29.615
We're called
"Across the Isle."

08:29.650 --> 08:31.584
Did you get that?
Aisle? Isle?

08:31.618 --> 08:33.919
Like an island and then
across the aisle,

08:33.953 --> 08:35.121
the political aisle.

08:35.155 --> 08:37.089
It's like a pun.
It's a play on words.

08:37.124 --> 08:38.289
- I do get it.
- Are you sure?

08:38.325 --> 08:39.605
We are definitely
coming to this.

08:39.626 --> 08:41.961
It's $8.00
if you buy your tickets now.

08:41.995 --> 08:43.294
It's $10.00 at the door.

08:43.330 --> 08:46.065
Fiscal conservative.
Love this guy.

08:46.099 --> 08:47.066
- Love this guy.
- Yeah.

08:47.100 --> 08:49.268
April Ludgate Dwyer.

08:49.303 --> 08:50.669
She worked on the Gryzzl deal

08:50.704 --> 08:52.371
that you guys did
the finances for.

08:52.406 --> 08:55.207
Now, I know that you're
opening up a consulting wing,

08:55.242 --> 08:57.843
and we just think that April
would be a great hire.

08:57.878 --> 09:00.046
Yeah, and here's the thing,
Barney.

09:00.080 --> 09:02.281
We're obviously very familiar
with what consulting is

09:02.315 --> 09:03.516
but why don't you go ahead
and tell my friends here,

09:03.550 --> 09:05.818
because I don't think
that they know.

09:05.852 --> 09:09.021
Well, it's really about finding
creative solutions

09:09.056 --> 09:11.190
to difficult problems.

09:11.224 --> 09:14.627
Now, a lot of times
there's firings, so...

09:14.661 --> 09:17.330
consultants aren't
exactly well liked.

09:17.364 --> 09:19.598
Holy crap. This is the job
for her, I can feel it.

09:19.633 --> 09:21.267
She'll take it!
Now let's talk perks.

09:21.301 --> 09:22.735
Does she get the summers off?
Is it like school?

09:22.769 --> 09:23.810
- Son, easy.
- Well,

09:23.948 --> 09:25.582
what did she major in?

09:25.617 --> 09:27.684
Economics? Accounting?

09:27.719 --> 09:29.386
She designed her own major.

09:29.421 --> 09:32.089
- "Halloween Studies."
- Trust me, Barney.

09:32.123 --> 09:34.792
She's brilliant and
a very fast learner.

09:34.826 --> 09:37.861
Does that, uh,
compound your interests?

09:37.896 --> 09:39.496
Huh?

09:39.531 --> 09:41.031
Ha ha!

09:41.066 --> 09:43.467
So what do you say?
Huh, Barney?

09:43.501 --> 09:46.170
- Oh, Ben, that was amazing.
- Thank you.

09:46.204 --> 09:48.338
But it's too late
for her to apply.

09:48.373 --> 09:51.308
I'm sorry but we're not really
taking any more applicants.

09:51.342 --> 09:55.746
Though I could make an exception
for someone else.

09:55.780 --> 09:57.715
Not interested.

09:57.749 --> 09:59.917
Okay, so five
yeses and four nos.

09:59.951 --> 10:01.552
Not a bad start.

10:01.586 --> 10:02.820
So, Leslie, I was going to talk
to you about this

10:02.854 --> 10:05.489
in a few weeks,
but Mike Norbert is retiring.

10:05.523 --> 10:08.726
Oh, really?
'Ol Norbs is stepping down.

10:08.760 --> 10:10.794
Couldn't handle the pressure,
huh? What a wuss.

10:10.829 --> 10:12.129
His marriage is falling apart.

10:12.163 --> 10:13.697
Oh--oh, okay.

10:13.731 --> 10:14.965
She had an affair
with his best friend.

10:14.999 --> 10:16.500
Ooh, okay, I feel bad about
what I said before.

10:16.534 --> 10:17.534
Yeah, I get it, I get it.

10:17.535 --> 10:19.236
So, anyway,
the good news for you is

10:19.270 --> 10:20.471
we'd like to promote you
to Deputy Director

10:20.505 --> 10:23.640
of Operations and Interior.

10:23.675 --> 10:25.008
Wow.

10:25.043 --> 10:26.810
You'd have to move to D.C.
and you have to complete

10:26.845 --> 10:29.213
the Senior Executive Service
Candidate Development program.

10:29.247 --> 10:30.581
I have to enroll
in S.E.S.C.D.P.?

10:30.615 --> 10:33.183
44 weeks of intensive courses
and note taking?

10:33.218 --> 10:35.753
Um, it's a dream come true.

10:35.787 --> 10:37.755
And I have to warn you, there'll
be a confirmation hearing.

10:37.789 --> 10:39.990
A confirmation hearing?
A freaking confirmation hearing?

10:40.024 --> 10:41.558
Excuse me a second.

10:41.593 --> 10:42.926
What's that?
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

10:42.961 --> 10:45.028
Um, to the best of my
recollection,

10:45.063 --> 10:46.997
yes, I accept the job.

10:47.032 --> 10:48.365
Oh, excuse me, ma'am?

10:48.400 --> 10:49.833
Do you mind if
I borrow your hat?

10:49.868 --> 10:51.502
I just want to throw it up in
the air victoriously.

10:51.536 --> 10:53.170
- No.
- Ma'am!

10:55.206 --> 10:56.907
I think that job's
perfect for April.

10:56.941 --> 10:58.942
We just have to convince Barney
to give her a shot.

10:58.977 --> 11:01.011
I mean, first problem,
she's not as qualified

11:01.046 --> 11:02.312
as the other applicants.

11:02.347 --> 11:04.415
Simple solution.
I break into her college

11:04.449 --> 11:06.984
and I change her degree
to accounting. Easy.

11:07.018 --> 11:09.820
On my way out, look up at
the blackboard, what is that?

11:09.854 --> 11:11.622
Impossible math equation?

11:11.656 --> 11:12.756
I solve it.

11:12.791 --> 11:15.058
X equals Y, obviously.

11:15.093 --> 11:16.660
Professor comes up to me
and says,

11:16.695 --> 11:20.330
"I've been working on that
for 50 years.

11:20.365 --> 11:24.401
Why don't you accept
this math trophy?"

11:24.436 --> 11:26.603
By the time he turns around,
I'm gone.

11:26.638 --> 11:28.872
We need to highlight
April's strengths.

11:28.907 --> 11:30.441
I thought we could update
her resume.

11:30.475 --> 11:32.810
This is the one
she applied to Parks with.

11:32.844 --> 11:36.080
It's just a signed photograph
of a puppet named Alf.

11:36.114 --> 11:38.348
Okay, so, we make
her an actual resume

11:38.383 --> 11:39.817
then put on a big presentation.

11:39.851 --> 11:42.419
Show Barney that
she's more than qualified.

11:42.454 --> 11:43.720
Gonna need all hands on deck.

11:43.755 --> 11:45.956
That's Craig, Donna,
and most importantly--

11:45.991 --> 11:47.724
- Please no.
- Come on, don't do it.

11:47.759 --> 11:49.626
Oh, you wanna photocopy?

11:49.661 --> 11:52.062
You guys want to do
all the mindless work?

11:52.097 --> 11:54.398
Yeah, I didn't think so.

11:56.134 --> 11:58.402
Get me Garry Gergich.

11:58.436 --> 12:01.338
Look around, April.

12:01.373 --> 12:03.107
What do you see?

12:03.141 --> 12:04.942
Fountains.

12:04.976 --> 12:06.644
Water.

12:06.678 --> 12:08.312
Sky.

12:08.346 --> 12:10.881
You...looking at me
like a crazy person.

12:10.915 --> 12:14.151
I see a new home.
I am gonna take that job.

12:14.185 --> 12:17.388
Ben's gonna run for Congress,
he will win eventually,

12:17.422 --> 12:18.722
and then we're gonna
split our time

12:18.756 --> 12:20.124
between Washington and Pawnee.

12:20.158 --> 12:22.326
That's great. It looks like
everything is

12:22.360 --> 12:23.327
falling into place for you.

12:23.361 --> 12:24.695
For us, April!

12:24.729 --> 12:26.063
- For us!
- Oh, God.

12:26.097 --> 12:27.164
Whoa! What is that?

12:27.198 --> 12:28.966
Over there, a lamp post?

12:29.000 --> 12:30.240
Is that historic, do you think?

12:30.268 --> 12:31.769
No. They put that in
in the 70s.

12:31.803 --> 12:33.737
Look, I am so ahead
of my five-year plan.

12:33.772 --> 12:36.807
Which means that you're gonna
need a new five-year plan,

12:36.841 --> 12:38.142
And here it is.

12:38.176 --> 12:40.744
Ow, it's hot! How did you
make this so fast?

12:40.779 --> 12:43.414
I keep a local binder maker
on retainer in D.C.

12:43.448 --> 12:46.517
We are about to embark on
such an amazing journey.

12:46.551 --> 12:49.920
This is gonna be our city.
And this is gonna be our bench.

12:49.954 --> 12:53.123
April, we have a bench
in D.C.!

12:53.158 --> 12:55.793
I'm sorry, Leslie,
I can't do this anymore.

12:55.827 --> 12:57.628
I don't want to work
in government.

12:57.662 --> 12:58.829
I quit.

13:01.366 --> 13:03.400
What are you talking about?

13:03.435 --> 13:05.002
You quit? Why?

13:05.036 --> 13:08.505
Because, honestly,
I don't even know if I like

13:08.540 --> 13:10.207
working in national parks.

13:10.241 --> 13:11.408
Or government.

13:11.443 --> 13:13.911
I just fell backwards
into your world

13:13.945 --> 13:17.047
and years have gone by,
and now I'm here

13:17.082 --> 13:18.482
and--Andy and Ben have been
helping me

13:18.516 --> 13:19.917
look into different jobs
to figure out

13:19.951 --> 13:21.452
what I really want to do.

13:21.486 --> 13:23.053
Ben who? Ben Wyatt?

13:23.088 --> 13:25.122
He's been helping you
behind my back?

13:25.156 --> 13:27.191
Wow, okay, you know what,
we had a good run,

13:27.225 --> 13:28.525
- but he's dead to me now.
- It's just--

13:28.560 --> 13:30.594
I've been on this weird path
my entire adult life,

13:30.629 --> 13:32.730
and I need to figure out
what I really want.

13:32.764 --> 13:34.264
I cannot believe
you're quitting.

13:34.299 --> 13:36.367
And I cannot believe this is the
first time I'm hearing it.

13:36.401 --> 13:38.736
And on our bench...

13:38.770 --> 13:40.755
of all places.

13:49.109 --> 13:50.350
You know, it's just
so frustrating.

13:50.433 --> 13:51.700
I mean, I love her, but,
you know,

13:51.735 --> 13:52.735
you spend so much time and
effort on someone's life

13:52.769 --> 13:54.009
and she's just gonna quit on me?

13:54.037 --> 13:56.038
It's like, what's the point,
you know?

13:56.403 --> 13:58.471
Wow, Leslie. I haven't
seen you this upset

13:58.505 --> 14:00.773
since you almost forgot
Ann's half-birthday.

14:00.808 --> 14:02.408
- Yeah.
- Tell me.

14:02.443 --> 14:03.409
How many times have
we had lunch?

14:03.444 --> 14:06.079
Five.
Well, eight, if you count

14:06.113 --> 14:07.914
all those times I showed up
unannounced at your office

14:07.948 --> 14:09.048
with mini-muffins.

14:09.083 --> 14:10.984
And why have we had lunch
so many times?

14:11.018 --> 14:14.020
Well, because, when I knew I
would be coming to Washington

14:14.054 --> 14:17.357
to work, I wore you down until
you agreed to become my friend.

14:17.391 --> 14:18.992
I'm so glad that you did.

14:19.026 --> 14:21.628
And you are wonderful friend,
but, sometimes

14:21.662 --> 14:23.696
you're so focused and driven

14:23.731 --> 14:25.131
that you forget about
people's feelings.

14:25.165 --> 14:28.968
Ah, pfft! Name one time
I've done that.

14:29.003 --> 14:30.570
Well, you were so wrapped up
in your story

14:30.604 --> 14:33.373
that you actually ate my waffle.

14:33.407 --> 14:35.441
Sometimes, all you can do

14:35.476 --> 14:37.477
is give people
a little bit of advice

14:37.511 --> 14:39.913
and a push,
but you have to realize

14:39.947 --> 14:42.415
April has to be able to
make up her own mind.

14:42.449 --> 14:44.651
Ah, you're right...

14:44.685 --> 14:46.519
once again, Madeleine Albright.

14:46.553 --> 14:48.321
Can I have my pin back now?

14:48.355 --> 14:49.889
Oh! Oh, yeah, sorry.

14:49.924 --> 14:51.324
Thank you for letting
me wear it.

14:51.358 --> 14:52.659
Just makes me feel
very powerful.

14:52.693 --> 14:53.993
Me too.

14:55.562 --> 14:58.998
Resume's done. I used bullet
points instead of numbers

14:59.033 --> 15:00.934
because I find it conveys
strength and confidence.

15:00.968 --> 15:03.503
A binder of her accomplishments.

15:03.537 --> 15:05.505
Photos of her
getting the job done.

15:05.539 --> 15:07.473
And $500 cash,
in case you want to go

15:07.508 --> 15:08.708
the straight-up bribe route.

15:08.742 --> 15:09.976
Donna...

15:10.010 --> 15:11.678
You put me on the team,
I find a way to win.

15:11.712 --> 15:12.845
Okay, copies are made.

15:12.880 --> 15:15.415
Um, everything has been
collated and stapled.

15:15.449 --> 15:17.050
And all the research
has been double-checked.

15:17.084 --> 15:18.718
I went through
quite a few staples.

15:18.752 --> 15:21.454
I added a personal testimony
vouching for April's brilliance.

15:21.488 --> 15:22.722
And this guy better
appreciate it because

15:22.756 --> 15:25.325
I do not compare people to
Mary J. Blige lightly.

15:25.359 --> 15:26.893
Uh, no one should.

15:26.927 --> 15:27.927
Do you want to go
to dinner tonight?

15:27.962 --> 15:29.128
- I do not.
- Respect.

15:29.163 --> 15:30.930
- I'm free.
- I have plans.

15:30.965 --> 15:32.398
Well, great job, guys.

15:32.433 --> 15:34.634
With all this, Barney will at
least have to give her a shot.

15:34.668 --> 15:37.203
Sure, they did a good job,
but this isn't enough.

15:37.238 --> 15:39.672
And I've been thinking
about it all day

15:39.707 --> 15:41.240
and I have a plan

15:41.275 --> 15:42.742
to go the extra mile

15:42.776 --> 15:45.445
and make April seem like
the ideal candidate.

15:51.118 --> 15:53.453
Give me the job!

15:53.487 --> 15:56.889
My name's April Ludgate and my
talent is explosive!

15:58.559 --> 16:01.327
Go U-S-A!
U-S-A!

16:01.362 --> 16:03.896
U-S-A!
U-S-A!

16:03.931 --> 16:06.566
U-S-A! When should I tell April
to show up?

16:06.600 --> 16:07.834
My car...

16:13.374 --> 16:14.841
Hey.

16:14.875 --> 16:16.442
Thank you for coming.

16:16.477 --> 16:18.144
Yeah, well, I had to miss

16:18.178 --> 16:20.580
the memorable rain gutters of
Washington walking tour,

16:20.614 --> 16:21.915
so, this better be good.

16:21.949 --> 16:25.018
I'm sorry I blew up
at you yesterday.

16:25.052 --> 16:27.654
I really want all of my friends
to be happy together,

16:27.688 --> 16:31.791
but, more importantly,
I just want them to be happy.

16:31.825 --> 16:35.395
If you feel like you need to
move on, I totally get it.

16:35.429 --> 16:38.264
Okay.

16:38.299 --> 16:39.899
- Turn around.
- What? Why?

16:39.934 --> 16:41.768
Because I'm about to say
something serious

16:41.802 --> 16:43.503
and I can't do it if I have to
look you in the eye.

16:43.537 --> 16:45.038
- Please.
- Okay.

16:46.907 --> 16:48.942
Now take your shoes off
and wear them like mittens.

16:48.976 --> 16:52.245
- April...
- Okay, sorry.

16:52.279 --> 16:59.085
When I started working for you,
I was aimless

16:59.119 --> 17:02.655
and just thought everything
was stupid and lame,

17:02.690 --> 17:05.425
and you turned me into someone

17:05.459 --> 17:08.694
with goals and ambition,

17:08.729 --> 17:11.664
which is really the only reason
why I'm even thinking about

17:11.699 --> 17:13.766
what I really want.

17:16.236 --> 17:20.607
I just...
wanna say thank you.

17:20.641 --> 17:23.609
And I love you very much.

17:23.644 --> 17:27.747
Which is why I have decided not
to turn you into a sea urchin,

17:27.781 --> 17:30.817
which I could do,
because I am an actual witch

17:30.851 --> 17:33.786
- with powers and I'm evil
- I know.

17:33.821 --> 17:35.788
- and I hate everything.
- I know you do.

17:35.823 --> 17:38.791
I know.
Thank you, April.

17:38.826 --> 17:43.096
So you don't have any idea
what you want to do?

17:43.130 --> 17:45.899
Well, here's the good news:
I am on the case.

17:45.933 --> 17:49.102
I know some people who might be
able to help us. Come on.

17:49.136 --> 17:51.871
April, this is Alyssa from the
American Service Foundation.

17:51.905 --> 17:53.406
They take young people like you

17:53.440 --> 17:55.208
who are trying to
explore a new path

17:55.242 --> 17:57.276
and match them with one of
the thousands of jobs

17:57.311 --> 17:59.279
across America
that help communities.

17:59.313 --> 18:01.147
Alyssa, this is April Ludgate,

18:01.181 --> 18:03.883
the single greatest
human being ever,

18:03.918 --> 18:06.319
and you need to find her a job
that she will love and cherish

18:06.353 --> 18:07.387
and make her life feel complete.

18:07.421 --> 18:08.488
Okay. I'm sorry.

18:08.522 --> 18:09.856
I found this crazy woman
on the street

18:09.890 --> 18:11.391
and she won't leave me alone.

18:11.425 --> 18:14.460
Oh, I'm very familiar
with Leslie's...enthusiasm.

18:14.495 --> 18:16.062
They contacted us
last year because

18:16.096 --> 18:18.097
they wanted to place some people
in national parks.

18:18.132 --> 18:20.300
Two days later, we had
set up the entire program,

18:20.334 --> 18:22.936
and she sent me a throw pillow
with my face stitched onto it.

18:22.970 --> 18:25.104
Not my best work.
Plus, you changed your hair.

18:25.139 --> 18:26.339
I'm gonna send you another one.

18:26.373 --> 18:29.075
Okay, go solve all of
your career problems.

18:29.109 --> 18:30.276
I'll wait right here.

18:30.311 --> 18:31.444
Sorry.

18:31.478 --> 18:34.121
- That-a girl!
- Ugh, Mom!

18:36.174 --> 18:37.540
I don't know, Madeleine.

18:37.613 --> 18:39.761
They're taking forever and
I'm starting to lose it.

18:39.881 --> 18:40.848
Talk to me, okay?

18:40.882 --> 18:41.982
Your voice makes me calm.

18:42.017 --> 18:43.718
Tell me another Yeltsin story.

18:43.752 --> 18:45.214
Okay, she's here.
I have to go. Bye.

18:45.334 --> 18:47.425
Say hi to your daughters.
Hey. Hi.

18:47.545 --> 18:48.812
How did it go?

18:48.846 --> 18:52.515
I'm great. I know exactly
what I want to do.

18:52.550 --> 18:55.251
Yes!
Is it Teach for America?

18:55.286 --> 18:56.786
No! Habitat for Humanity?

18:56.821 --> 18:58.755
No! It's working
with animals.

18:58.789 --> 19:02.459
No. I want to work here.
At the foundation.

19:02.493 --> 19:04.294
I want to be like Alyssa.

19:04.328 --> 19:05.595
I wanna tell people what to do

19:05.629 --> 19:07.831
and then send them
far away from me.

19:07.865 --> 19:08.865
It's perfect.

19:08.899 --> 19:10.333
And it hits everything
on my list.

19:10.368 --> 19:12.535
Creative problem solving,
working one-on-one--

19:12.570 --> 19:15.672
I am 100,000%
in support of this idea.

19:15.706 --> 19:17.440
This is an amazing idea.
I love this idea!

19:17.475 --> 19:18.675
And I love you!

19:18.709 --> 19:19.843
So are they hiring?

19:19.877 --> 19:21.478
What did Alyssa say
when you told her?

19:21.512 --> 19:22.912
Um, nothing.
I didn't tell her yet.

19:22.947 --> 19:26.349
I wanted to see if you thought
it was a good idea first.

19:26.384 --> 19:27.384
What?

19:27.418 --> 19:29.052
Bad idea?

19:29.086 --> 19:30.654
You wanted to run
something by me?

19:30.688 --> 19:31.655
Oh, my God.

19:31.689 --> 19:34.991
Yes. So, will you help me?

19:35.026 --> 19:37.460
April, you don't need me.

19:37.495 --> 19:38.895
You can get any job you want.

19:38.930 --> 19:40.530
All by yourself.

19:40.564 --> 19:42.933
Well, obviously I'm going to
vet your resume

19:42.967 --> 19:44.334
and we'll hold
some mock interviews

19:44.368 --> 19:46.102
and I'll choose your outfit
and everything but--

19:46.137 --> 19:49.673
you can get this sucker
on your own.

19:49.707 --> 19:52.976
So, long story short, we might
have found you the perfect job

19:53.010 --> 19:54.911
but also I might have blown it.

19:54.946 --> 19:57.480
Ben and Ron are there now
to try to fix it.

19:57.515 --> 20:00.183
And if they don't, I feel like
it's kind of on them.

20:00.217 --> 20:01.918
Everyone is being
so nice to me lately.

20:01.952 --> 20:04.621
It's weird. I feel like I need
to take a shower in pig's blood

20:04.655 --> 20:06.022
to wash all the niceness off me.

20:06.057 --> 20:07.190
It's because we love you.

20:07.224 --> 20:08.391
We want you to be happy.

20:08.426 --> 20:10.293
This consulting job could be
the answer.

20:10.328 --> 20:12.829
Yeah, so about that...

20:14.932 --> 20:17.583
Please don't hold anything Andy
did against April.

20:18.045 --> 20:19.952
She is an exceptional human being,

20:20.072 --> 20:22.107
who married a well meaning goof.

20:22.387 --> 20:25.440
And I think that presentation
we put together says it all.

20:25.560 --> 20:27.388
All we're asking is thatyou meet with her

20:27.637 --> 20:30.095
and seriously consider her
for the job.

20:30.215 --> 20:33.026
And if she disappoints you,
you can hold me...

20:33.296 --> 20:35.317
accountable.

20:35.741 --> 20:37.824
- Right?
- You know what?

20:37.944 --> 20:40.044
If her friends are trying
this hard,

20:40.164 --> 20:42.053
there must be something
amazing about her.

20:42.173 --> 20:43.478
Tell her I'll meet with her tomorrow--

20:43.598 --> 20:44.863
Uh, hold on. April?

20:45.125 --> 20:47.075
Hey, we were just talking about you.

20:47.195 --> 20:48.525
We got some good news.

20:50.928 --> 20:52.409
Oh, boy.

20:53.360 --> 20:55.096
Okay.

20:56.071 --> 20:59.604
She doesn't want the job.

21:00.517 --> 21:01.705
I see.

21:05.492 --> 21:07.959
Well, this is uncomfortable.
