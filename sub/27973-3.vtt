WEBVTT

00:08.681 --> 00:11.001
My name is Simone. I'm his sister.

00:11.321 --> 00:15.441
You got me into deep shit. They'll
be coming. Until they have what they want.

00:28.001 --> 00:30.001
We've got new orders.
And an additional order saying:

00:30.081 --> 00:31.521
Avoid combat situation.

00:31.841 --> 00:33.961
- What?
- Abort attack.

00:34.121 --> 00:36.121
Five of our boats are out there.
They count on us.

00:36.241 --> 00:38.281
Tell the men to stand down!

00:38.401 --> 00:39.441
Aye, sir.

00:39.641 --> 00:43.641
You will liaise with a vessel and effect
an exchange. It's about this man.

00:45.841 --> 00:46.721
Plane!

02:15.201 --> 02:16.561
2 U-boats...

02:17.121 --> 02:18.841
That's 100 dead comrades.

02:20.361 --> 02:22.281
Only because we aborted the attack.

02:23.761 --> 02:25.441
And now this poor lad.

02:27.121 --> 02:29.641
It's one thing to die in combat,

02:31.041 --> 02:33.841
but to die because we've taken
a passenger on board.

02:34.001 --> 02:35.241
A foreigner.

02:36.121 --> 02:37.361
That's...

02:37.641 --> 02:38.881
a disgrace.

02:40.521 --> 02:43.161
With you in command it would have been
different, First Watch Officer.

02:44.721 --> 02:47.441
Unfortunately I don't have a father
who makes me CO.

02:48.361 --> 02:49.241
Even though...

02:50.881 --> 02:52.121
Hoffmann senior

02:52.641 --> 02:54.841
would have attacked the convoy on his own.

02:55.201 --> 02:58.041
He wouldn't have given a damn about
what Lorient would have had to say.

03:03.841 --> 03:05.441
Imbued with the determination to win

03:06.001 --> 03:08.881
and unrelenting towards himself.

03:08.961 --> 03:11.361
Junior doesn't even understand
the meaning of this sentence.

04:56.921 --> 04:58.641
If you don't like my cooking,
just tell me.

04:58.721 --> 05:00.001
I won't be offended.

05:16.521 --> 05:19.601
I'll leave it out for you.
In case you get hungry later.

06:54.441 --> 06:55.641
What do you want?

06:55.761 --> 06:57.001
I am looking for Nathalie.

06:58.681 --> 07:00.081
I need to talk to her. It's important.

07:02.521 --> 07:04.641
Let her come in.

07:21.041 --> 07:22.241
Have a seat.

07:45.681 --> 07:47.881
Béatrice takes care of Anna
when I'm at work.

07:51.281 --> 07:54.161
A German officer got shot in Nantes

07:54.281 --> 07:56.041
and afterwards
they wanted to register us all.

07:56.681 --> 07:57.881
As reprisal.

07:59.081 --> 08:00.361
I fled.

08:01.161 --> 08:02.841
I got the job at Le Cheval Blanc.

08:03.241 --> 08:05.881
I never worked upstairs in case that's
what you were thinking. I'm a barmaid.

08:05.961 --> 08:06.961
Yes.

08:09.281 --> 08:12.521
What's the best place to hide
from the Germans for a Jewish girl?

08:15.001 --> 08:16.201
Amongst German soldiers.

08:20.561 --> 08:24.001
I didn't know that Frank...

08:24.321 --> 08:26.281
He didn't tell me.

08:27.281 --> 08:28.561
I know.

08:28.921 --> 08:31.081
With your brother,
it just happened like that.

08:32.521 --> 08:35.041
The Jazz brought us closer.

08:35.201 --> 08:36.801
Louis Armstrong.

08:37.321 --> 08:39.761
It wasn't planned
that I would get pregnant straight away.

08:39.841 --> 08:42.641
I asked him for money for the abortion,
but he didn't want me to get it.

08:43.001 --> 08:44.241
He wanted to keep it.

08:44.681 --> 08:46.201
He wanted to be a father.

08:48.521 --> 08:52.001
That's when I told him everything.

08:53.961 --> 08:55.441
That I'm Jewish.

08:57.961 --> 08:59.561
He didn't mind at all.

09:00.401 --> 09:02.961
He couldn't understand
why I hadn't told him straight away.

09:04.761 --> 09:05.881
Frank...

09:06.561 --> 09:07.921
wanted to buy passports.

09:08.001 --> 09:09.801
Yes, I...

09:09.881 --> 09:11.081
America...

09:11.201 --> 09:13.841
It was just an idea, just a dream.

09:14.081 --> 09:16.681
They are way too expensive
on the black market anyway.

09:19.761 --> 09:22.361
He wanted to pay with this.

09:23.921 --> 09:26.521
He gave it to me
to hand it over to a woman.

09:27.121 --> 09:30.321
In exchange for passports, I...

09:30.601 --> 09:32.081
Do you know what this is?

09:33.561 --> 09:36.961
No, I can only tell you that...

09:37.041 --> 09:42.401
He talked more and more about leaving.
He said that he may have found a way out.

09:48.121 --> 09:50.281
If you knew what I've done.

09:59.841 --> 10:01.201
Would you like to hold her?

10:03.201 --> 10:04.041
Yes.

10:16.041 --> 10:17.921
That's your aunt Simone.

10:25.321 --> 10:26.881
She likes you.

10:34.081 --> 10:35.441
I've got to go.

10:39.681 --> 10:41.081
Is that your girl?

10:42.961 --> 10:44.241
Yes.

10:44.681 --> 10:45.841
Show me.

10:51.961 --> 10:53.001
Pretty girl.

10:53.601 --> 10:54.801
Is she French?

10:54.961 --> 10:56.001
Yes.

10:59.081 --> 11:01.241
Tell me. Frank, you speak English, right?

11:02.321 --> 11:04.561
Is it true that the guy's name
is Greenwood?

11:04.761 --> 11:05.961
Sam Greenwood?

11:07.681 --> 11:09.801
Greenwood, Samuel Greenwood.

11:10.521 --> 11:13.801
At home, one with that name
scrubs the road. With a toothbrush.

11:14.121 --> 11:16.001
Do you think we have a fucking Jew
on board?

11:18.121 --> 11:19.281
I'll find out.

11:19.601 --> 11:21.961
I can smell them 10 miles
against the wind, I swear.

12:58.601 --> 13:00.001
- Ralf?
- Huh?

13:00.081 --> 13:01.681
Is there something left of the dried meat?

13:03.601 --> 13:04.761
The last bit?

13:04.841 --> 13:06.361
That's okay.

13:07.401 --> 13:08.561
Serves you right.

13:08.641 --> 13:09.641
What do you mean?

13:09.721 --> 13:11.361
Well, you told Lutz about it.

13:11.521 --> 13:12.841
Change of watch. Get out.

13:12.961 --> 13:13.801
So what?

13:13.921 --> 13:16.001
One look in his dumb, fat face is enough.

13:16.201 --> 13:18.121
He can't keep a secret to himself,
the loud mouth.

13:18.601 --> 13:19.681
You could have told me.

13:19.761 --> 13:21.041
You're a big boy.

13:22.161 --> 13:24.281
Asshole.

13:25.001 --> 13:27.721
We'll be the laughing stock back on shore.

13:28.841 --> 13:30.321
We're backstabbers.

13:32.401 --> 13:34.161
So who the fuck is this asshole?

13:34.641 --> 13:36.121
Maybe a prisoner of war.

13:36.601 --> 13:37.801
Or a spy.

13:39.001 --> 13:42.281
Maybe he knows something
that could help us win the war.

13:42.521 --> 13:44.001
You get that from your book?

13:44.081 --> 13:45.441
Maybe he's Irish.

13:45.561 --> 13:46.961
What?

13:47.041 --> 13:50.401
I knew a guy, planesman on U-65. Dead now.

13:50.521 --> 13:53.841
But he told me they once had
a special mission to take two Irishmen

13:53.961 --> 13:55.921
from Wilhelmshaven back to Dublin.

13:56.361 --> 13:59.561
IRA men, freedom fighters
against the Tommies.

13:59.641 --> 14:01.561
Then let him peel the potatoes.

14:01.681 --> 14:04.001
The Micks know a thing or two
about potatoes.

14:06.321 --> 14:08.361
Thorsten finally made a joke.

14:08.441 --> 14:09.961
Well done, kiddo.

14:10.001 --> 14:11.441
Whoever he is,

14:11.761 --> 14:13.081
he's bad luck.

14:13.961 --> 14:15.401
Why bad luck?

14:16.881 --> 14:20.001
Best peel them to the right.
Or else none of us will return home.

14:21.761 --> 14:24.441
Another stupid comment like this
and I'll kill you!

14:25.121 --> 14:26.881
I promise.

14:47.041 --> 14:48.121
Hey.

14:48.841 --> 14:51.641
That thing about the CO.
You heard it too?

14:51.721 --> 14:53.401
About the U-boats? Of course.

14:53.601 --> 14:55.041
That's not what I'm talking about.

14:55.281 --> 14:57.281
Something about his last mission.

14:58.041 --> 15:00.681
But I couldn't believe it. Not at first.

15:01.041 --> 15:02.881
Then I heard it
from a couple of other people.

15:03.001 --> 15:04.121
What?

15:06.161 --> 15:07.721
Come on, tell me.

15:10.001 --> 15:12.281
Only if you won't tell anybody.

15:15.761 --> 15:21.721
A damaged U-boat is making its stop here
for repairs before carrying on to Lorient.

15:22.161 --> 15:23.841
It's Schulz's boat.

15:24.081 --> 15:25.681
- The Schulz?
- Yes.

15:26.161 --> 15:28.721
They've been at sea for 10 weeks

15:29.681 --> 15:31.361
and will let off steam accordingly.

15:31.601 --> 15:32.841
Nonetheless,

15:33.081 --> 15:35.961
Berlin expects us to give them
a warm welcome for the cameras.

15:36.081 --> 15:37.201
We'll have to make it look really good.

15:37.601 --> 15:39.401
There could even be some locals.

15:39.521 --> 15:41.321
But no-one who fought
in the Spanish Civil war.

15:41.441 --> 15:43.001
On top of that for the wrong side.

15:43.041 --> 15:44.201
I can reassure you.

15:45.401 --> 15:47.681
The death of that woman
is rather unfortunate.

15:47.761 --> 15:49.321
It's not really like you.

15:49.401 --> 15:51.041
That was the fault of the local police.

15:51.121 --> 15:53.001
Was she from around here?

15:53.041 --> 15:55.761
Probably not. Nobody reported her missing.

15:55.841 --> 15:56.881
What does that mean?

16:00.001 --> 16:01.281
I'm working on that.

16:01.361 --> 16:03.201
Do that, Forster.

16:03.281 --> 16:06.401
You know how much I rely
on the French workers.

16:06.521 --> 16:09.241
I cannot afford to jeopardize the peace
on the base.

16:35.841 --> 16:37.201
What are you going to do?

16:38.361 --> 16:40.921
We didn't get what we needed. So,
the British won't give us anything either.

16:58.561 --> 16:59.201
Hello.

16:59.561 --> 17:00.961
Hi.

17:01.841 --> 17:03.801
- Did you have a nice evening?
- Yes, yes.

17:04.321 --> 17:07.081
- Thanks. And you?
- Yes, it was nice, thanks.

17:09.521 --> 17:11.041
- See you later.
- Yes, see you later.

17:13.281 --> 17:15.041
Good morning, Criminal Inspector Forster.

17:15.721 --> 17:17.001
Just Mister Forster, please.

17:17.721 --> 17:18.921
Oh, no thanks.

17:20.521 --> 17:21.641
Miss Simone,

17:21.841 --> 17:23.121
I've got a serious problem.

17:23.761 --> 17:24.921
With the prisoner?

17:25.601 --> 17:26.441
What makes you say that?

17:27.201 --> 17:29.281
Don't worry, she has been relocated.

17:30.001 --> 17:31.121
She's not our problem anymore.

17:31.241 --> 17:32.681
Apparently there are
more pressing matters.

17:32.761 --> 17:34.201
A parade for King Kong.

17:34.281 --> 17:35.121
Who?

17:35.321 --> 17:38.441
His real name is Schulz.
A U-boat CO, returning triumphantly.

17:38.921 --> 17:42.161
Gluck asked me to ensure
the event goes smoothly.

17:42.841 --> 17:45.241
I was wondering if I could persuade you
to go on a short trip with me.

17:46.201 --> 17:47.121
Maybe tomorrow.

17:47.241 --> 17:49.881
I'd love to show you something
very dear to me.

17:51.001 --> 17:51.881
Yes.

17:52.041 --> 17:53.681
Don't worry, I know how to behave.

17:53.881 --> 17:55.441
Thanks for the invitation.

17:56.401 --> 17:57.961
I'm glad, Miss Simone.

18:08.521 --> 18:09.681
Are you sure?

18:11.681 --> 18:13.201
Yes, I swear.

18:13.761 --> 18:15.081
He shot him.

18:15.921 --> 18:16.801
In cold blood.

18:17.321 --> 18:18.841
Did you hear about Hoffmann?

18:19.121 --> 18:20.001
No, tell me.

18:21.001 --> 18:25.041
He told the firing squad to stand down
so he could shoot the kid himself.

18:25.121 --> 18:26.321
You're making this up.

18:27.201 --> 18:29.641
He shot him right in the face.

18:30.001 --> 18:31.401
Twice, the cowardly bastard.

18:31.801 --> 18:32.641
Hoffmann?

18:32.721 --> 18:34.561
Of course, Hoffmann. Who else?

18:37.321 --> 18:40.641
We should follow a course due north
to avoid further air attacks.

18:40.721 --> 18:41.841
And then we swing west here.

18:42.121 --> 18:44.561
Can we still manage to be on time
for the rendezvous?

18:44.681 --> 18:45.561
Yes,

18:45.641 --> 18:48.281
if we diagonally cross
these Allied shipping lanes.

18:48.521 --> 18:49.841
What distance are we talking about?

18:49.961 --> 18:51.841
Normally about 30 nautical miles.

18:54.521 --> 18:56.681
We could dive underneath the convoy route.

18:57.041 --> 18:58.681
Is this possible
from a technical point of view?

19:01.161 --> 19:02.761
If the batteries are fully charged

19:02.841 --> 19:05.121
and we squeeze every last milli-ampere
out of them...

19:05.361 --> 19:06.361
yes.

19:10.041 --> 19:13.201
Alright.
We'll go with the Chief's suggestion.

19:14.921 --> 19:15.881
If you need me,

19:16.561 --> 19:17.761
I'll be on the bridge.

19:25.321 --> 19:28.161
You know the rumor
that our passenger is a Jew?

19:33.441 --> 19:35.601
I'm not interested in rumors, Strelitz.

21:13.281 --> 21:14.961
Take him back, before I lose my temper.

21:15.001 --> 21:15.921
Tennstedt!

21:18.241 --> 21:19.601
I was only notifying the passenger

21:19.681 --> 21:22.121
that he is not at liberty
to walk around the boat.

22:56.601 --> 22:58.281
May I help you?

23:03.961 --> 23:05.201
How do I find them?

23:07.601 --> 23:08.921
They'll find you.

23:14.121 --> 23:15.041
Maybe.

23:25.361 --> 23:28.801
Here you go. Enjoy your meal.

24:07.121 --> 24:09.041
Just a moment, am I getting this right?

25:29.001 --> 25:30.001
Tell me Ralf,

25:30.641 --> 25:32.361
do you know the game "cucumber shooting"?

25:32.441 --> 25:33.281
Nope.

25:33.361 --> 25:34.241
You don't know it?

25:34.361 --> 25:36.081
You deaf? He just told you he didn't.

25:36.161 --> 25:37.361
Okay, listen.

25:37.721 --> 25:39.081
Two whores

25:39.201 --> 25:40.801
are laid on their backs on the floor.

25:41.121 --> 25:44.081
And each of them gets a cucumber
shoved up her pussy.

25:44.881 --> 25:48.881
Then the shooter slaps
his whore on the belly

25:49.121 --> 25:51.881
and the shooter who shoots
his cucumber the furthest has won.

26:01.961 --> 26:04.161
Can't you shut your fucking trap
just for once?

26:05.001 --> 26:06.161
I'm not kidding.

26:07.281 --> 26:08.121
Beginner's luck.

26:08.201 --> 26:09.041
No such thing.

26:09.721 --> 26:10.841
Another hand?

26:11.201 --> 26:12.241
Of course.

26:12.321 --> 26:13.321
Guys,

26:13.681 --> 26:15.761
don't you get bored of gambling?

26:16.121 --> 26:18.681
More bored than cruising around
and playing taxi?

26:20.001 --> 26:21.281
Fucking shit cruise.

27:52.761 --> 27:54.041
Watch out, boys,

27:54.321 --> 27:55.441
here comes the Frenchman.

27:55.561 --> 27:56.441
Frenchman?

27:56.681 --> 27:58.361
Yep, he's not a real German.

27:58.801 --> 27:59.641
A Frenchman?

28:01.081 --> 28:02.681
And someone from Africa?

28:04.561 --> 28:06.121
What kind of crew are we?

28:06.361 --> 28:07.201
Strasser,

28:08.081 --> 28:10.121
you know you make noises in your sleep?

28:10.281 --> 28:12.881
Squealing noises.
High pitched little squeals.

28:13.041 --> 28:14.281
Strange squeals.

28:14.761 --> 28:16.001
Squeals.

28:16.361 --> 28:18.441
You've got to be really careful with him.

28:18.921 --> 28:21.681
- He got his CO court-martialed.
- Cut the crap.

28:21.801 --> 28:24.001
Did they sentence Hinz, yes or no?

28:24.041 --> 28:25.361
It was a fucking disgrace

28:25.641 --> 28:27.001
to sink a hospital ship!

28:27.681 --> 28:28.881
But I didn't squeal on him.

28:28.961 --> 28:30.041
Of course you did.

28:30.121 --> 28:32.001
I'm wondering if
it runs in your family.

28:32.361 --> 28:36.241
Chubby here says, that you saw your sister
before we sailed.

28:36.321 --> 28:37.721
I'm going to pay her a visit.

28:37.801 --> 28:39.121
Maybe she squeals too

28:39.281 --> 28:41.161
if I give it to her from behind.

28:45.841 --> 28:47.001
No, Frank!

28:47.241 --> 28:48.801
Strasser! Strasser!

28:49.441 --> 28:50.761
What the hell is wrong with you?

28:52.841 --> 28:53.761
Nothing, Sir.

28:56.001 --> 28:56.881
Get up.

28:59.401 --> 29:00.401
Just a misunderstanding.

29:01.001 --> 29:02.641
Extra watch duties for both of you.

29:03.001 --> 29:04.081
Starting now for you.

29:04.641 --> 29:06.001
Come on, move it.

29:08.081 --> 29:09.441
And you, get cleaned up.

29:10.041 --> 29:11.161
You look like shit.

29:30.281 --> 29:33.361
Everyone in the office is really excited
about the parade tomorrow.

29:34.441 --> 29:35.361
You too?

29:37.281 --> 29:41.161
I won't attend. I don't approve
of grandstanders like Schulz.

29:41.601 --> 29:44.801
As if his efforts were any greater
than the ones from those still out there.

29:49.001 --> 29:50.001
I'm sorry.

29:51.721 --> 29:54.081
I'm sure your brother
will come back unharmed.

29:54.401 --> 29:55.921
I'm looking forward to meeting him.

30:19.961 --> 30:20.921
Here we are.

30:21.121 --> 30:22.001
Thank you.

30:26.721 --> 30:27.561
So?

30:28.041 --> 30:29.281
What do you think?

30:29.721 --> 30:30.561
It's beautiful.

30:31.081 --> 30:31.961
Very big.

30:32.561 --> 30:35.041
Yes. I bought it recently.

30:36.321 --> 30:38.241
I intend to stay here, Simone.

30:39.041 --> 30:41.601
In France. Once we've won the war.

30:44.761 --> 30:46.841
Please, come on in.
A little snack is waiting for us.

30:54.641 --> 30:57.441
"Civilization and its Discontents"
by Sigmund Freud

30:59.401 --> 31:00.281
Freud.

31:00.921 --> 31:04.081
My psychology professor
was profoundly influenced by his theses.

31:05.321 --> 31:08.761
Jewish. Yes.
But he had some interesting ideas.

31:10.441 --> 31:11.281
Have a seat.

31:14.041 --> 31:17.521
In the future, nobody will care
that it was written by a Jew.

31:17.601 --> 31:19.681
Nobody will remember what a Jew was.

31:24.921 --> 31:26.841
A Châteaux Grand Céroux.

31:27.201 --> 31:29.281
We should really let it breathe but...

31:45.281 --> 31:46.121
Cheers.

31:47.081 --> 31:48.001
Cheers.

31:56.001 --> 31:58.241
I'm really happy
that you accepted my invitation.

31:58.521 --> 31:59.321
Gladly.

32:02.681 --> 32:03.641
It's beautiful.

32:05.001 --> 32:07.041
Yes, I can see a future for myself here.

32:08.561 --> 32:10.281
And an easy life. Please help yourself.

32:10.361 --> 32:12.641
Once we've got rid
of a few pockets of resistance.

32:17.521 --> 32:18.681
Resistance?

32:19.241 --> 32:21.761
Nothing major. Just a few small cells.

32:23.081 --> 32:23.961
And what

32:24.881 --> 32:26.761
do you mean by small cells?

32:27.441 --> 32:30.241
They consist of 5 to 6 people,

32:30.321 --> 32:31.761
they are decentralized, mainly criminals.

32:32.561 --> 32:35.401
But you've seen with your own eyes
how aggressive they can be.

32:39.001 --> 32:41.281
By the way, the female prisoner
had an accomplice. A woman.

32:43.161 --> 32:45.161
Freud describes very well in his book

32:47.161 --> 32:50.641
that some people only follow
their destructive impulses.

32:51.961 --> 32:54.001
Unfortunately,
we don't have a photo yet, but

32:54.561 --> 32:56.081
this could be her.

32:56.561 --> 32:57.921
I need this translated.

33:05.681 --> 33:07.281
Miss Simone, I have a favor to ask.

33:09.601 --> 33:11.161
Would you give me French lessons?

33:11.241 --> 33:14.641
My language skills are unfortunately
very <i>mauvaise.</i>

33:16.921 --> 33:17.801
Yes.

33:18.601 --> 33:20.321
If you want to be correct, it's <i>mauvais.</i>

33:21.041 --> 33:23.561
In French, "language skills" is male.

33:25.041 --> 33:26.401
That proves my point.

33:27.241 --> 33:28.801
I always dreamed of that.

33:29.521 --> 33:31.881
A strict teacher with your looks.

34:05.841 --> 34:06.881
Come on, let's go.

38:48.401 --> 38:49.681
Where are we?

38:52.961 --> 38:54.121
More or less finished.

38:55.121 --> 38:56.001
Good.

39:29.281 --> 39:31.961
I'm sorry, Sir. I lost control.

39:33.161 --> 39:35.121
You and Maas,
you were on the same boat before?

39:36.161 --> 39:38.521
- U-311.
- Hinz' boat?

39:41.241 --> 39:42.841
Don't worry, Strasser.

39:50.321 --> 39:52.761
Is it true that two of our U-boats
are missing?

39:53.921 --> 39:55.921
From the pack that attacked the convoy.

39:59.681 --> 40:00.521
Who says that?

40:01.161 --> 40:02.001
The First Watch Officer.

40:03.921 --> 40:06.361
The Second Watch Officer heard it
on the supply ship.

40:08.001 --> 40:09.761
The scout U-boat is always under attack.

40:10.201 --> 40:12.081
And the other one was probably blasted
by the destroyers.

40:14.921 --> 40:15.801
Sir.

40:15.921 --> 40:17.721
We're reaching the Allied convoy route.

40:30.321 --> 40:31.961
Conning tower hatch is closed.

40:33.321 --> 40:34.201
Rig ship for dive.

40:34.281 --> 40:35.441
Rig buoyancy vents.

40:37.841 --> 40:39.921
Two U-boats? And you don't say a word?

40:40.081 --> 40:40.961
Aft buoyancy vent rigged.

40:41.001 --> 40:43.401
I thought the Second Watch Officer
already told you?

40:43.841 --> 40:46.001
As First Watch Officer it is your duty
to report to me.

40:46.241 --> 40:48.801
Anything else is
an act of insubordination, Tennstedt.

40:48.881 --> 40:50.041
All buoyancy vents rigged.

40:54.601 --> 40:55.401
You can go.

40:56.361 --> 40:57.761
The Second Watch Officer is taking over.

41:09.721 --> 41:11.601
Dive, dive, dive. Cycle the vents.

41:14.561 --> 41:15.841
Four zero meters.

41:16.041 --> 41:18.441
Fifteen degrees down on the bow planes.
Zero degrees on the stern planes.

41:20.521 --> 41:22.001
Did you know about the two boats?

41:23.761 --> 41:26.601
- Yes, but I thought they...
- Second Watch Officer in control room.

41:52.601 --> 41:53.801
Have you ever played this?

41:54.641 --> 41:55.681
Never.

41:56.121 --> 41:57.041
You'd like to learn how?

41:57.521 --> 41:58.521
Sure, why not?

41:59.521 --> 42:01.681
It's about beating the king.

42:02.441 --> 42:04.401
And therefore you have
different chess pieces.

42:07.921 --> 42:09.041
Have you ever heard the saying?

42:10.041 --> 42:12.121
One can't expect to be able
to do something in war

42:12.241 --> 42:13.681
that one hasn't learnt in peacetime.

42:13.801 --> 42:14.641
What?

42:14.961 --> 42:16.121
Yeah, you know all kinds of shit.

42:16.641 --> 42:18.921
I knew a First Watch Officer
who said it all the time.

42:19.081 --> 42:22.241
Odd guy, had a glass eye
which had turned bright yellow.

42:23.841 --> 42:26.161
Oh no, they're moldy. Holy moly.

42:26.281 --> 42:27.401
It's going to be stew then.

42:27.521 --> 42:29.041
Just tell me where you heard it.

42:29.881 --> 42:32.601
It's on the wall. In the lobby.
At Mürwik.

42:32.681 --> 42:33.801
Mürwik?

42:34.241 --> 42:35.401
The Officer's College?

42:35.681 --> 42:36.761
Yeah, where else?

43:37.841 --> 43:40.241
Stop talking to the passenger.

44:15.001 --> 44:15.961
Here, the passports.

44:41.361 --> 44:42.921
Take the little one and leave.

44:48.201 --> 44:52.641
I couldn't believe anything good
could ever happen to me again.

44:55.121 --> 44:56.441
Frank will join you there later.

45:00.281 --> 45:01.161
Do you have money?

45:02.761 --> 45:05.521
Enough for the... the passage.

45:10.601 --> 45:11.801
So, you know where to go?

45:12.361 --> 45:14.201
To Lisbon. I think.

45:15.161 --> 45:17.321
I'll let him know.
He will join you there.

45:20.681 --> 45:22.721
And you? What are you going to do?

48:14.641 --> 48:16.161
Make sure to take in enough vitamins.

48:16.241 --> 48:18.441
The first ones
already have the sniffles, Sir.

48:18.841 --> 48:20.561
Ah, almost forgot.

48:21.081 --> 48:21.961
Here's your apple.

48:22.001 --> 48:22.881
Thanks.

48:25.441 --> 48:26.401
Sir,

48:26.801 --> 48:28.441
I had a clear view and was able
to plot stars.

48:28.561 --> 48:31.161
Our current position is north
of the convoy route as planned.

48:34.401 --> 48:36.201
You remember the reason for the war?

48:37.001 --> 48:39.681
Air to breathe
without Jews and Bolsheviks.

48:41.601 --> 48:43.641
And now we're transporting a bloody Yid.

48:44.041 --> 48:45.321
Are you sure about that?

48:46.241 --> 48:47.641
The guy is circumcised.

48:47.721 --> 48:51.761
90% of the Yanks are circumcised.
So that they wank less. That's the truth.

50:01.041 --> 50:02.001
Ahead! Ship in sight!

50:02.281 --> 50:03.281
Now, now.

50:04.441 --> 50:05.521
Slow down.

50:07.081 --> 50:08.241
And be quiet.

50:11.001 --> 50:12.561
Distance 3000.

50:12.641 --> 50:13.841
She's heaving to.

50:15.601 --> 50:16.881
She has it in for us.

50:23.161 --> 50:24.601
ALARM!

50:24.681 --> 50:26.681
Corvette at zero zero five!

50:26.761 --> 50:29.401
- ALARM!
- ALARM!

50:29.921 --> 50:31.281
Wake up, assholes.

50:31.361 --> 50:34.121
Put the bunks away.
Flood tubes one to four.

50:35.241 --> 50:36.241
Go, go, go, move, faster!

50:36.321 --> 50:37.841
Conning tower hatch is closed.

50:37.921 --> 50:39.401
Dive, dive, dive. Cycle the vents.

50:39.841 --> 50:40.961
Periscope depth!

50:41.001 --> 50:43.681
Fifteen degrees down on the bow planes.
Zero degrees on the stern planes.

50:58.721 --> 50:59.841
An American Corvette.

51:00.641 --> 51:01.441
They've detected us.

51:03.201 --> 51:04.441
Do we try to avoid them?

51:05.441 --> 51:08.881
If they alert other escorts,
we could come under sustained attack.

51:10.001 --> 51:11.761
We can't chicken out again.

51:12.441 --> 51:13.281
Not this time.

51:22.641 --> 51:23.681
Battle stations!

51:24.281 --> 51:25.201
Aye, Sir.

51:26.841 --> 51:29.641
- Battle stations.
- Battle stations.

51:30.281 --> 51:31.841
Battle stations.

51:37.161 --> 51:38.081
Open the outer doors.

51:38.161 --> 51:39.401
Aye, open the outer doors.

51:57.441 --> 51:58.921
Distance 2000,

51:59.641 --> 52:01.201
angle-on-the-bow, starboard thirty,

52:02.441 --> 52:05.241
Torpedo speed 30, running depth 4,

52:05.441 --> 52:06.641
right full rudder!

52:06.801 --> 52:08.441
New course:

52:08.601 --> 52:09.521
zero-four-five.

52:10.121 --> 52:13.761
Right full rudder.
New course: zero-four-five.

52:15.161 --> 52:18.561
Angle-on-the-bow,
starboard forty-five in three minutes.

52:18.881 --> 52:20.321
Our best shot.

52:23.841 --> 52:24.881
Today we're lucky.

52:30.121 --> 52:31.441
Corvette now at three-four-zero degrees.

52:31.561 --> 52:33.121
Angle-on-the-bow, starboard forty.

52:33.241 --> 52:35.641
Make tubes number one and two ready
for submerged firing.

52:36.801 --> 52:40.401
Forward room, make ready tubes
number one and two for submerged firing.

52:42.401 --> 52:44.761
Tubes number one and two
ready for submerged firing.

52:45.321 --> 52:46.201
Go on, killer.

52:47.361 --> 52:48.401
Your turn today.

52:53.601 --> 52:55.281
Keep periscope depth, one meter up!

52:55.681 --> 52:56.961
Five degrees up on the bow planes.

53:09.001 --> 53:10.441
Torpedo speed 30.

53:11.081 --> 53:12.321
Enemy speed 15,

53:12.921 --> 53:15.001
angle-on-the-bow, starboard forty-five.

53:15.121 --> 53:16.361
Distance 17 hundred.

53:18.961 --> 53:20.321
Is there a problem, First Watch Officer?

53:22.681 --> 53:23.881
No problem, Sir.

53:25.801 --> 53:27.001
Torpedo speed 30.

53:27.961 --> 53:29.081
Enemy speed 15,

53:29.521 --> 53:30.601
angle-on-the-bow,

53:30.681 --> 53:31.761
starboard forty-five.

53:32.241 --> 53:33.561
Distance 17 hundred.

53:34.601 --> 53:35.761
Fire one! Fire two!

53:37.161 --> 53:38.241
Fire one! Fire two!

53:38.321 --> 53:39.401
Fire torpedoes!

53:53.921 --> 53:54.841
Safety released.

53:55.001 --> 53:55.881
Safety released.

53:55.961 --> 53:56.801
Push it.

53:57.961 --> 53:58.801
Secure safety.

53:58.881 --> 53:59.721
Secured.

53:59.801 --> 54:00.641
And now push it inside.

54:00.801 --> 54:01.921
Twenty-one...

54:02.001 --> 54:03.121
Twenty-two...

54:03.201 --> 54:04.401
Twenty-three...

54:04.521 --> 54:05.441
Twenty-four...

54:09.761 --> 54:10.601
Hit!

54:10.681 --> 54:13.121
Yeah!

54:16.121 --> 54:18.681
Shit, pull it back.

54:29.081 --> 54:31.881
Help me. Lift him, fucking hell.

54:44.881 --> 54:45.721
Jesus Christ.

54:46.681 --> 54:47.921
We need a belt, quick.

54:48.081 --> 54:49.161
Little one, come over here.

54:49.921 --> 54:50.961
You've got to help me.

54:51.881 --> 54:52.881
We have to stop the bleeding.

54:53.321 --> 54:56.001
Okay, you hold him down.
Take this please and now pull.

54:56.081 --> 54:57.441
As hard as you can.

54:57.561 --> 54:58.921
Rig ship for surface.

55:05.401 --> 55:08.841
I'm really sorry, but you can't keep it.
We need to amputate.

55:08.921 --> 55:12.281
Hold him down, okay? Really hard.

55:12.361 --> 55:14.761
Grab hold of his arm. Tight.

55:14.841 --> 55:17.761
Yes. Alright, and now we start to cut,
okay? You ready?

55:22.921 --> 55:24.161
You can do it, buddy.

55:24.241 --> 55:25.721
You can do it.

56:27.121 --> 56:29.281
That's your responsibility.

56:29.441 --> 56:33.041
We survive air raids and destroyer attacks
and then something like this happens

56:33.161 --> 56:36.361
where my men are supposed to be safe.

56:39.601 --> 56:41.721
You have a slight concussion.

56:41.801 --> 56:43.001
This will help if your head aches.

56:43.041 --> 56:44.001
Get some rest.

57:11.201 --> 57:13.241
Hey you. Get me more wine.

57:38.001 --> 57:39.121
Pour it.

57:45.041 --> 57:46.121
For you too.

57:48.401 --> 57:50.161
Hey, has one of you ever fucked her?

57:50.241 --> 57:51.241
No.

57:51.321 --> 57:53.121
But she's pretty.

57:53.201 --> 57:55.041
Way prettier than the one you've got.

57:55.641 --> 57:57.001
You're right.

58:04.121 --> 58:06.001
Alright, let's go upstairs now.

58:06.081 --> 58:09.281
No, I just work at the bar.

58:09.361 --> 58:10.201
What?

58:12.721 --> 58:15.601
She says she only works down here
and doesn't fuck.

58:16.881 --> 58:17.841
Girl,

58:18.561 --> 58:21.561
that feels as wrong as a bomb going off
in a safe harbor.

58:23.241 --> 58:24.601
You try to run or what?

58:25.441 --> 58:27.921
So if you don't come with me upstairs,
we do it right here.

58:30.761 --> 58:32.241
Fucking French whore!

58:32.321 --> 58:33.841
You do what you're told!

58:35.841 --> 58:39.161
Fuck her!

58:39.241 --> 58:41.881
Fuck her! Fuck her! Fuck, fuck, fuck...
