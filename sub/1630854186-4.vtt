00:02.002 --> 00:04.221
Previously onYoung Sheldon...Why do you look like
you're gonna cry?

00:04.265 --> 00:07.224
A year ago, I was a TV
weather girl in San Antonio,

00:07.268 --> 00:09.792
and now I'm living in a
garage with the 17-year-old

00:09.835 --> 00:10.923
who got me pregnant.

00:10.967 --> 00:12.795
I'll be 18 before you know it.

00:12.838 --> 00:14.492
But not before you're a father!

00:14.536 --> 00:16.538
It's gonna be okay.

00:16.581 --> 00:17.713
[sniffles, exhales]

00:17.756 --> 00:19.106
Is it?

00:19.149 --> 00:21.804
[whispers]:
I peed in the sink last night.

00:21.847 --> 00:22.805
[squeaks]

00:22.848 --> 00:24.937
Trust me. I'll fix this.

00:24.981 --> 00:26.591
Make yourself at home.

00:26.635 --> 00:28.811
Oh. Thank you so much.

00:28.854 --> 00:30.465
It's only temporary. I promise.

00:30.508 --> 00:31.988
Oh. No problem.

00:32.032 --> 00:33.468
Stay as long as you need.

00:33.511 --> 00:34.860
Bathroom's right down the hall.

00:34.904 --> 00:36.819
Oh, boy, a bathroom.

00:39.300 --> 00:40.475
MEEMAW:
Here you go--

00:40.518 --> 00:42.825
scrambled eggs, bacon,

00:42.868 --> 00:46.829
biscuits and fresh-squeezed
orange juice.

00:46.872 --> 00:48.700
Thank you. Looks amazing.

00:48.744 --> 00:49.832
Where's mine?

00:49.875 --> 00:51.138
You're not pregnant. She is.

00:51.181 --> 00:53.705
Well, I like to think
we're pregnant.

00:54.445 --> 00:55.664
Really?

00:55.707 --> 00:57.057
Are your ankles swollen?

00:57.100 --> 00:58.580
Did you throw up this morning?

00:58.623 --> 00:59.842
Are you constipated?

00:59.885 --> 01:00.973
No, dear.

01:01.017 --> 01:02.236
Stop calling me "dear."

01:02.279 --> 01:03.367
I'm not your dear.

01:03.411 --> 01:04.194
You want
breakfast,

01:04.238 --> 01:05.413
eggs are here,

01:05.456 --> 01:06.414
stove is there.

01:06.457 --> 01:07.545
Knock yourself out.

01:07.589 --> 01:08.633
I get she's pregnant.

01:08.677 --> 01:09.982
I don't know why
you're so moody.

01:10.026 --> 01:11.723
On the count of three...

01:11.767 --> 01:13.856
I'm leaving, I'm leaving.

01:13.899 --> 01:15.379
Have a good day, Mama.

01:15.423 --> 01:17.294
Ugh. "Mama."

01:17.338 --> 01:20.210
♪ Nobody else
is stronger than I am ♪

01:20.254 --> 01:22.952
♪ Yesterday I moved a mountain

01:22.995 --> 01:25.520
♪ I bet I could be your hero

01:25.563 --> 01:28.218

01:28.262 --> 01:32.701

01:35.356 --> 01:37.009
ADULT SHELDON:
Since losing his job,

01:37.053 --> 01:39.142
one of the few upsides
for my dad

01:39.186 --> 01:42.624
was having the house to himself
to enjoy some peace and quiet.

01:42.667 --> 01:44.147
BRENDA: Billy!

01:44.191 --> 01:46.584
Stop feeding the chickens
Cap'n Crunch!

01:46.628 --> 01:48.412
BILLY: But they like it.We've been over this.

01:48.456 --> 01:51.241
You don't eat their food,
they don't eat yours.

01:51.285 --> 01:53.591
Everything okay over there?

01:54.636 --> 01:55.506
Yeah.

01:55.550 --> 01:57.204
Doesn't sound okay.

01:57.247 --> 01:59.467
Oh. You don't want to know.

01:59.510 --> 02:00.990
Tell me.

02:03.166 --> 02:04.820
He's failing math,

02:04.863 --> 02:06.126
and they might hold him back.

02:06.169 --> 02:07.823
That's rough.

02:07.866 --> 02:10.826
I try helping him, but math
was never my strong suit.

02:10.869 --> 02:12.262
Yeah, I hear ya.

02:12.306 --> 02:13.698
And when you do try to
help 'em, they realize

02:13.742 --> 02:14.830
how dumb you are.

02:14.873 --> 02:16.788
You think...

02:16.832 --> 02:18.399
Sheldon would help Billy?

02:18.442 --> 02:21.924
[sighs] I'm not sure helping
others is where he shines.

02:21.967 --> 02:24.318
Pissing 'em off--
he's got that down cold.

02:25.188 --> 02:27.234
Well, then I'm screwed.

02:27.277 --> 02:29.018
I can't afford a tutor.

02:30.193 --> 02:31.629
Let me talk to Sheldon,

02:31.673 --> 02:32.717
see what I can do.

02:32.761 --> 02:34.719
Appreciate it.

02:34.763 --> 02:36.025
BILLY: Mom, look!

02:37.113 --> 02:39.942
That chicken is not a hat!

02:39.985 --> 02:41.900
Hurry.

02:45.121 --> 02:45.991
Hey. How was school?

02:46.035 --> 02:47.384
Sucked.

02:47.428 --> 02:48.516
Language.

02:48.559 --> 02:49.778
You asked, and it did.

02:49.821 --> 02:50.866
What happened?

02:50.909 --> 02:52.476
I don't want to talk about it.

02:52.520 --> 02:53.347
Are you sure?

02:53.390 --> 02:55.044
I'm a pretty good listener.

02:55.087 --> 02:57.655
Then why didn't you hear me say
I don't want to talk about it?

02:57.699 --> 03:00.180
Is this about a boy?Mom.

03:00.223 --> 03:02.965
I-I do have some experience
on the subject.

03:03.008 --> 03:04.793
Please, the only two boys
you have experience with

03:04.836 --> 03:06.621
are Dad and Jesus.

03:06.664 --> 03:08.188
I'm gonna go talk to Meemaw.

03:09.580 --> 03:11.669
I know other boys.

03:11.713 --> 03:14.237
And then he walked right on
by me like I wasn't there.

03:14.281 --> 03:16.239
Does he even know you like him?

03:16.283 --> 03:18.850
I don't know. I've ignored him,
been mean to him.

03:18.894 --> 03:20.287
What else can I do?

03:20.330 --> 03:23.203
Sounds like you've
tried everything.

03:23.246 --> 03:24.856
Okay.

03:24.900 --> 03:26.554
I've got an idea.

03:26.597 --> 03:27.990
Why don't you just tell him?

03:28.033 --> 03:29.644
But what if he
doesn't like me back?

03:29.687 --> 03:30.688
I would die.

03:30.732 --> 03:32.124
You will not die.

03:32.168 --> 03:33.952
Oh, yes, I will.
I will be dead,

03:33.996 --> 03:35.345
and you will be sad
at my funeral.

03:35.389 --> 03:36.651
How about this--

03:36.694 --> 03:38.348
why don't you get
one of your girlfriends

03:38.392 --> 03:40.263
to find out
how he feels about you.

03:40.307 --> 03:43.440
Why?Because then you don't have
to put yourself on the spot.

03:43.484 --> 03:46.138
Okay. And if he
doesn't like me back,

03:46.182 --> 03:48.053
I'll just keep being mean
to him until he does.

03:48.924 --> 03:49.968
I don't know why that works.

03:50.012 --> 03:51.318
Men are dumb.

03:51.361 --> 03:53.363
Does that mean
we're dumb for liking 'em?

03:54.234 --> 03:57.367
It's not a good look for us.

04:01.328 --> 04:02.677
[knocking]You busy?

04:02.720 --> 04:04.156
Yes, but I'm also excellent

04:04.200 --> 04:06.811
at bifurcating
my cognitive abilities. Hit me.

04:06.855 --> 04:08.073
[sighs]

04:08.117 --> 04:10.293
Billy is struggling with math,
and, mm,

04:10.337 --> 04:12.382
his mom was hoping
that you could tutor him.

04:12.426 --> 04:13.340
I could.

04:13.383 --> 04:14.341
Great.

04:14.384 --> 04:15.167
But I won't.

04:15.211 --> 04:16.560
Why not?

04:16.604 --> 04:18.345
Because me teaching Billy
is like trying to use

04:18.388 --> 04:19.911
the gravitational power
of a neutron star

04:19.955 --> 04:21.696
to change the spin of a boson.

04:21.739 --> 04:23.567
Don't do that.

04:23.611 --> 04:25.134
If he doesn't pass math,

04:25.177 --> 04:26.614
they're gonna hold him back.

04:26.657 --> 04:27.789
That's the system working.

04:27.832 --> 04:29.225
Very Darwinian.

04:30.008 --> 04:31.488
Yeah. Never mind.

04:31.532 --> 04:33.621
Yeah, I told Brenda teaching
wasn't really your thing.

04:34.578 --> 04:35.840
Well, it's not that
I can't do it.

04:35.884 --> 04:36.928
Don't worry about it.

04:36.972 --> 04:38.234
You're good at a lot of things.

04:38.278 --> 04:39.670
Teaching just ain't one of 'em.

04:39.714 --> 04:42.282
I know what you're doing.
It's reverse psychology.

04:42.325 --> 04:43.631
I don't know what
you're talking about.

04:43.674 --> 04:46.068
It's childish and obvious.

04:46.111 --> 04:48.157
So you'll do it?Yes, I'll do it.

04:49.027 --> 04:50.638
Thanks for the pie.

04:50.681 --> 04:53.293
Mandy keeps bringing all
these leftovers from the diner.

04:53.336 --> 04:56.426
[chuckles]Well, she's lucky to have you.

04:56.470 --> 04:57.601
[softly]:
Mm-hmm.

04:57.645 --> 04:59.299
And Missy, too.

05:00.038 --> 05:01.866
Lucky, lucky.

05:01.910 --> 05:04.347
Oh, it's killing you, isn't it?

05:04.391 --> 05:05.653
What? No.

05:05.696 --> 05:06.697
I...

05:06.741 --> 05:08.090
I am happy

05:08.133 --> 05:11.659
that she has an adult
she can confide in

05:11.702 --> 05:14.009
about...
[sputters softly]

05:15.532 --> 05:17.621
Come on. Just tell me.

05:17.665 --> 05:19.406
I would.

05:19.449 --> 05:23.366
But the bond between a girl
and her grandmother is...

05:23.410 --> 05:24.498
sacred.

05:24.541 --> 05:27.152
I am her mother
and I am your daughter.

05:27.196 --> 05:28.632
Give me something.

05:28.676 --> 05:29.981
[sighs]

05:30.025 --> 05:31.809
It's just boy stuff, okay?

05:31.853 --> 05:33.071
[exhales]

05:33.115 --> 05:34.986
That she'd rather
talk to you about.

05:35.030 --> 05:36.118
That's right.

05:36.161 --> 05:38.250
[sighing groan]

05:39.382 --> 05:40.340
There you go.

05:41.166 --> 05:43.255
Eat those feelings.

05:43.299 --> 05:45.127
All right, I'm given
to understand you have

05:45.170 --> 05:47.564
a test coming up on
negative numbers and fractions.

05:47.608 --> 05:48.870
Yeah.

05:48.913 --> 05:51.263
So, what part
don't you understand?

05:53.962 --> 05:55.267
Oh, boy.

05:55.311 --> 05:56.617
Let's take it back a step.

05:56.660 --> 05:58.183
Where do you stand
on addition, subtraction,

05:58.227 --> 05:59.881
multiplication and division?

05:59.924 --> 06:01.839
I'm against it.

06:01.883 --> 06:03.188
[exhales]

06:03.232 --> 06:04.799
[quietly]:
Oh, boy.

06:05.626 --> 06:06.757
Hope you like tuna salad.

06:06.801 --> 06:08.019
I brought you a whole tub.

06:08.063 --> 06:09.456
How old is it?

06:09.499 --> 06:11.501
I don't know,
but the clock's ticking.

06:11.545 --> 06:13.416
Meemaw?

06:13.460 --> 06:14.635
Uh-oh.

06:14.678 --> 06:15.679
We need to talk.

06:15.723 --> 06:16.637
Hi.

06:16.680 --> 06:18.160
Hi.What's going on?

06:18.203 --> 06:20.031
I told Heather
that I liked Kevin

06:20.075 --> 06:22.077
so she could find out
if he liked me back.

06:22.120 --> 06:23.687
Then she asked him out.

06:23.731 --> 06:24.993
What?She didn't even think

06:25.036 --> 06:26.821
he was cute
until I said I liked him.

06:26.864 --> 06:27.996
Well, why'd
you tell her?

06:28.039 --> 06:29.127
She told me to.

06:29.171 --> 06:30.390
'Cause that's
how you find out

06:30.433 --> 06:31.956
if somebody likes you
in school.

06:32.000 --> 06:34.698
That's o-one way.

06:34.742 --> 06:36.134
Why? What would you have done?

06:36.178 --> 06:39.094
Uh, well, you put him
on Heather's radar

06:39.137 --> 06:40.356
when you said
you liked him.

06:40.400 --> 06:42.010
I probably would
have dropped a note

06:42.053 --> 06:44.012
in his locker or asked
one of his guy friends.

06:44.055 --> 06:45.622
That makes so much more sense.

06:46.362 --> 06:47.581
Why didn't you tell me that?

06:47.624 --> 06:48.756
I gave you good advice.

06:48.799 --> 06:50.845
It's not my fault
Heather sucks.

06:50.888 --> 06:52.716
[scoffs]
So what do I do now?

06:52.760 --> 06:53.891
Well, the first thing...

06:53.935 --> 06:55.110
I was talking to her.

07:00.985 --> 07:02.944
Okay, your basic
arithmetic skills

07:02.987 --> 07:04.859
are disappointing
but functional.

07:04.902 --> 07:05.468
Thank you.

07:06.251 --> 07:08.036
All right, let's talk
about negative numbers.

07:08.079 --> 07:09.298
I'm all ear.

07:09.341 --> 07:10.342
"Ears."

07:10.386 --> 07:11.866
No. "Ear."

07:11.909 --> 07:13.389
This one's clogged.

07:13.433 --> 07:15.173
Right. Okay.

07:15.217 --> 07:18.046
Negative numbers are numbers
that are less than zero.

07:18.089 --> 07:19.874
But zero's nothing.Yes.

07:19.917 --> 07:22.050
So how can you have
less than nothing?

07:22.093 --> 07:23.225
Let's see.

07:23.268 --> 07:24.487
How about this?

07:24.531 --> 07:26.533
If you have a dollar,
that's one.

07:26.576 --> 07:28.709
If you have no dollars,
that's zero.

07:28.752 --> 07:30.972
But if you owe me a dollar,
that's negative one.

07:31.015 --> 07:32.060
Does that make sense?

07:32.103 --> 07:33.278
I think so.

07:33.322 --> 07:34.758
All right,
we're making progress.

07:34.802 --> 07:35.803
Mom!

07:35.846 --> 07:38.066
I owe Sheldon
a dollar.

07:38.980 --> 07:40.372
Tomorrow, I'm
gonna tell Heather

07:40.416 --> 07:41.722
what a bitch she
is in front of everyone.

07:41.765 --> 07:43.637
No, no, no.
Don't show your cards.

07:43.680 --> 07:46.030
Tomorrow, you're gonna be
her best friend.Why?

07:46.074 --> 07:47.597
'Cause then
she'll tell you things,

07:47.641 --> 07:49.077
and you can
use those things against her.

07:49.120 --> 07:50.426
Oh. You're good.

07:50.470 --> 07:51.906
I know.

07:51.949 --> 07:54.735
It's nice to have someone
to talk to about this stuff.

07:54.778 --> 07:58.216

08:06.398 --> 08:07.922
Oh.

she can talk to.

Oh, honey,
I'm sorry.

08:49.877 --> 08:52.488
Hey. Maybe you could put
in a good word for me.

08:52.532 --> 08:55.056
And what would that word be?

08:55.099 --> 08:57.232

into this pickle.

09:05.893 --> 09:09.157
And if you add negative one
and positive one,

you get?

09:10.375 --> 09:11.768
Zero?

Correct.

I think I understand.

09:15.032 --> 09:16.425
Good.One question--

09:16.468 --> 09:18.688
how can you have zero
if zero is nothing?

09:19.602 --> 09:21.082
It's not something
that you have.

09:21.125 --> 09:23.563
Zero represents
a state of nothingness.

09:24.912 --> 09:26.000
What does that mean?

09:26.043 --> 09:27.654
It's nothingness.

09:27.697 --> 09:29.569
The absence of somethingness.

09:30.657 --> 09:31.875
Trust me, zero is a thing.

09:31.919 --> 09:33.747
But you just said
it's a nothing.

09:33.790 --> 09:35.444
I did.

09:35.487 --> 09:37.272
Which is it?

09:37.315 --> 09:39.100
A something or a nothing?

[exploding sound]

09:43.495 --> 09:44.366

09:44.409 --> 09:45.889
Zero might not exist.

09:45.933 --> 09:49.458

Of course zero exists.

09:49.501 --> 09:51.199
Great.
Then explain it to me.

09:51.242 --> 09:53.244
Easy.
Zero is nothing.

09:53.288 --> 09:55.595
But how can nothing
be a thing?

09:56.465 --> 09:57.684
Think of it this way--

09:57.727 --> 09:59.816
picture an empty box.

09:59.860 --> 10:01.339
All right.

10:01.383 --> 10:02.689

10:02.732 --> 10:03.907
Nothing.

10:03.951 --> 10:05.953
It's not nothing.
Air, atoms, molecules--

10:05.996 --> 10:08.216

is as full as full can be.

10:08.259 --> 10:10.610
Regardless,

10:10.653 --> 10:12.699
zero is very important.

I'm not saying
it isn't important.

round guy ain't real.

10:16.659 --> 10:18.618
You're being silly.

Parmenides said,

10:30.107 --> 10:32.588
"Nothing cannot exist,
because to speak of something

10:32.632 --> 10:35.243
is to speak of something
that exists."

10:35.286 --> 10:37.549

16:18.847 --> 16:20.588
Jesus, please help me.

16:20.631 --> 16:23.417
I'm already the biggest kid
in sixth grade.

16:24.853 --> 16:25.854
Amen.

16:25.897 --> 16:27.377
Amen.

16:28.248 --> 16:30.598
[TV playing indistinctly]

16:32.861 --> 16:34.645
Hello? Who's in there?

16:34.689 --> 16:36.082
MISSY:
Me.

16:36.125 --> 16:37.648
I need to use the bathroom.

16:37.692 --> 16:39.302
Give me a minute.

16:40.825 --> 16:42.262
[sighs]

16:42.305 --> 16:45.047
Can someone give me a hand
with these groceries?

16:45.091 --> 16:46.396
Sure. Dad, come on.

16:46.440 --> 16:48.007
[stammers]
I got to go to the bathroom.

16:48.050 --> 16:49.573
Hey, Mandy.

16:49.617 --> 16:50.400
Mrs. Cooper.

16:50.444 --> 16:52.315
What brings you here?

16:53.142 --> 16:54.578
Just saying hi to Georgie.

16:55.405 --> 16:57.494
Why, hello to you, too.

16:58.930 --> 17:00.541
Let's get a move on.

17:03.805 --> 17:05.067
Oh, boy.

17:05.111 --> 17:06.851
Damn it, Missy.
I'm two seconds away

17:06.895 --> 17:08.984
from peeing
in your mother's prayer garden.[door closes]

17:09.028 --> 17:11.639
Look what I found.

17:11.682 --> 17:13.032
What the hell?

17:13.075 --> 17:13.945
Melissa Cooper,

17:13.989 --> 17:15.295
what did you do?

17:15.338 --> 17:17.732
Yeah. What did you do?

17:18.559 --> 17:19.908
Yeah.[door closes]

17:19.951 --> 17:21.170
Good news.
I think Billy

17:21.214 --> 17:23.085
might pass his
math test tomorrow.

17:23.129 --> 17:24.869
There's a math test tomorrow?

17:24.913 --> 17:26.436
Your hair is
upsetting me.

17:26.480 --> 17:28.569
Screw it.
I'm going outside.

17:29.744 --> 17:30.788
[door slams]

17:37.969 --> 17:39.232
[quietly]: You can cheat off me
if you want.

17:39.275 --> 17:40.102
I studied.

17:40.146 --> 17:41.712
[whispers]:
Thanks.

17:42.757 --> 17:45.325
ADULT SHELDON:
I'm not saying
it was God or zero,

17:45.368 --> 17:48.023
but a small miracle
did happen that day.

17:48.067 --> 17:50.504
Billy passed the test with a 68

17:50.547 --> 17:53.463
and went on
to the seventh grade.

17:53.507 --> 17:56.336
Where he remained
for the next several years.
