WEBVTT

00:06.374 --> 00:06.540
.

00:06.574 --> 00:07.475
- Previously on
"Falling Water..."

00:09.277 --> 00:10.444
- We found the girl
from the dream.

00:10.478 --> 00:12.080
- Still in touch
with Lainie Whicker?

00:12.113 --> 00:13.314
- No, she's gone.
- They stole my life.

00:13.347 --> 00:14.348
God only knows
what they did to me.

00:14.382 --> 00:15.583
- I think you're pregnant.

00:15.616 --> 00:17.251
- We're talking human
trafficking

00:17.285 --> 00:19.153
and the murder of a reporter

00:19.187 --> 00:22.056
by a politician to keep it all
from getting out.

00:22.090 --> 00:23.524
This isn't just about
Shadowman anymore.

00:23.557 --> 00:25.493
This is a full-on conspiracy.

00:25.526 --> 00:27.628
- Hull-Bedford is responsible
for this man's death.

00:27.661 --> 00:30.498
- I'll take a look.
That's all I can do.

00:30.531 --> 00:32.633
- There are layers and layers
separating my name

00:32.666 --> 00:34.502
from all of this, right?

00:34.535 --> 00:36.337
- It seems like they know a lot
more than they're saying.

00:36.370 --> 00:37.605
- Guy took a nosedive.

00:37.638 --> 00:39.540
54 floors.

00:39.573 --> 00:42.143
- If Taylor Bennett is the one
who hired Shadowman,

00:42.176 --> 00:44.278
then she's our best shot at
putting an end to all of this.

00:44.312 --> 00:46.080
- We're gonna get
this Taylor Bennett.

00:46.114 --> 00:47.615
And she's gonna lead us
right to the asshole

00:47.648 --> 00:49.550
who did this to you
and Sabine and your mother.

00:49.583 --> 00:51.252
- You put this out tomorrow,
and there's no way

00:51.285 --> 00:52.653
Harding's campaign
could survive

00:52.686 --> 00:54.155
this kind of a scandal.

00:55.623 --> 00:57.191
- Didn't have to go down
that way.

00:57.225 --> 00:58.559
- Bullshit, it didn't.

00:58.592 --> 01:00.228
- There are rumblings of
a former Whittaker intern

01:00.261 --> 01:01.562
planning to surface

01:01.595 --> 01:03.597
with sexual harassment
accusations.

01:03.631 --> 01:08.302
Consider it done.

01:10.604 --> 01:12.173
- Sabine.

01:12.206 --> 01:14.642
It's me.

01:14.675 --> 01:18.679
- Go away.

01:23.417 --> 01:27.121
- I heard what happened.

01:27.155 --> 01:29.323
And I know there's nothing I
can say to change things now,

01:29.357 --> 01:31.592
but I'm gonna get you
out of here, okay?

01:31.625 --> 01:33.461
- Please stop.

01:33.494 --> 01:35.363
- Sabine,
please don't shut me out.

01:35.396 --> 01:36.597
Let me help you.

01:36.630 --> 01:39.167
- Forget about me.

01:39.200 --> 01:43.337
My life is over.

01:43.371 --> 01:45.273
I don't deserve to live.

01:45.306 --> 01:46.474
- Don't say that.

01:46.507 --> 01:47.608
- It's true.
- Sabine, please--

01:47.641 --> 01:51.545
- I killed your mother!

01:51.579 --> 01:53.547
Just leave me alone.

01:53.581 --> 01:55.216
- Just don't hurt yourself
again, okay?

01:55.249 --> 01:56.350
Please--
- Guard!

01:56.384 --> 01:57.518
- If you can just
give me a second.

01:57.551 --> 01:59.487
I'm gonna get you out of here,
okay?

01:59.520 --> 02:00.621
I promise.

02:00.654 --> 02:03.157
- All right, time to go.

02:06.194 --> 02:13.267
*

02:22.310 --> 02:29.383
*

02:31.285 --> 02:32.520
- Ronald.

02:33.554 --> 02:34.688
Strawberries?

02:34.722 --> 02:36.490
- You remembered.

02:36.524 --> 02:38.259
- Better when they're fresh.

02:38.292 --> 02:39.660
- Thank you.

02:41.562 --> 02:43.197
- I've been meaning to ask,

02:43.231 --> 02:44.398
who are you named after?

02:44.432 --> 02:45.566
- Ronald Reagan.

02:45.599 --> 02:47.768
I'm going to be an American
some day.

02:52.573 --> 02:54.608
- I'm afraid not.

02:54.642 --> 02:56.244
- Not really, no.

02:56.277 --> 02:58.546
- It's the US of A for me
for sure then.

02:58.579 --> 03:00.248
I'm going to go there,
work hard,

03:00.281 --> 03:01.515
and someday be lawyer.

03:01.549 --> 03:03.951
Then my whole family
can live there with me.

03:03.984 --> 03:05.586
- Sounds like you got it all
figured out.

03:05.619 --> 03:07.621
- It's all I ever think about.

03:07.655 --> 03:11.392
- Well, if I can help,
you know I'll try.

03:11.425 --> 03:13.261
- Just the strawberries.

03:13.294 --> 03:14.495
I can handle
everything else myself.

03:14.528 --> 03:15.696
I'm a very resourceful man.

03:17.030 --> 03:19.467
- Grab one.
- Thank you.

03:19.500 --> 03:23.371
Come on, wish me luck.
Three, two, one.

03:28.609 --> 03:32.313
- British Conspicuous
Gallantry Cross.

03:32.346 --> 03:33.547
SAS.

03:33.581 --> 03:36.550
That's U.K. Special Forces,
isn't it?

03:36.584 --> 03:39.453
Very impressive,
you being chosen for that.

03:39.487 --> 03:42.590
- Volunteered.
- Even more impressive.

03:42.623 --> 03:44.692
- Obviously, uh,

03:44.725 --> 03:45.826
you saw combat.

03:45.859 --> 03:47.795
- In Darfur, yes, sir.

03:47.828 --> 03:52.666
- Well, I can't think of a
reason why I can't hire you.

03:52.700 --> 03:55.303
Except one.

03:55.336 --> 03:57.471
I'm dead.

04:00.508 --> 04:02.276
*

04:02.310 --> 04:04.478
- I'm dead too.

04:04.512 --> 04:07.315
Just another one
of your casualties.

04:07.348 --> 04:10.017
- Ah, no.

04:18.792 --> 04:22.596
- You.

04:25.098 --> 04:27.368
- I got you.
.

04:27.401 --> 04:30.638
I got you.

04:37.878 --> 04:39.713
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

04:39.747 --> 04:40.781
Did we wake you?

04:40.814 --> 04:42.716
- Nah, I was up.

04:45.486 --> 04:47.421
- I got the big bowl.

04:54.428 --> 04:57.531
Go on.

04:57.565 --> 04:59.333
Hey.

04:59.367 --> 05:01.769
- You look tired.

05:01.802 --> 05:03.103
- I'm okay.

05:03.136 --> 05:05.406
- No, you're not.

05:13.681 --> 05:17.585
- Hey, you're here early.
- Yeah, I need to talk to Tess.

05:19.853 --> 05:24.425
She barely spoke to me.

05:26.594 --> 05:28.396
- It's obvious.

05:28.429 --> 05:30.564
She's given up.

05:30.598 --> 05:32.533
They put her in solitary.

05:36.504 --> 05:38.105
I have to go see her.

05:38.138 --> 05:40.674
- I'm not sure she'll see
any of us anymore.

05:44.978 --> 05:47.415
- I feel like shit.

05:47.448 --> 05:49.850
- Okay, I'll--I'll be there
in a second.

05:49.883 --> 05:51.585
- I gotta get to work.

05:51.619 --> 05:52.720
Go to Sabine.

05:52.753 --> 05:54.422
Maybe you can get
through to her.

05:54.455 --> 05:55.656
- Yeah.

05:55.689 --> 05:58.626
- I'll talk to you later.

05:58.659 --> 06:02.396
*

06:04.432 --> 06:06.967
- And as police were called
to escort him downtown,

06:07.000 --> 06:08.636
New York is wondering,

06:08.669 --> 06:11.439
is Phil Whittaker's
career over?

06:15.476 --> 06:17.511
- I don't know what happened.
I--I--I--

06:17.545 --> 06:18.712
I went to bed.

06:20.448 --> 06:21.882
- I don't know.
I m--

06:21.915 --> 06:25.653
Maybe.
Yeah, I--

06:25.686 --> 06:28.622
I dreamt
I was elected president.

06:28.656 --> 06:31.525
- Nothing like ambition.
What else?

06:31.559 --> 06:35.195
- I was taken to a party...

06:35.228 --> 06:37.565
It was a s--

06:37.598 --> 06:39.600
A sex party.

06:40.934 --> 06:42.202
Without describing
the naughty bits,

06:42.235 --> 06:43.671
tell me about the sex party.

06:43.704 --> 06:44.905
- There were people there,
lots of people.

06:44.938 --> 06:46.774
There were girls.
I was there.

06:46.807 --> 06:49.477
The guy who works for you.

06:49.510 --> 06:51.679
The guy who dug up all the
stuff on the mayor--uh, uh--

06:51.712 --> 06:52.913
Woody, he was there.

06:52.946 --> 06:54.715
But look,
you can fix this for us, right?

06:54.748 --> 06:56.216
I mean

06:56.249 --> 06:57.651
You can get one of your other
operatives to go out

06:57.685 --> 06:58.886
and dig up some more dirt
on Harding,

06:58.919 --> 07:00.521
'cause there's gotta be
something else.

07:00.554 --> 07:01.922
- I'm sorry, I can't do that,
Phil.

07:03.524 --> 07:05.959
- Because, my old friend,

07:05.993 --> 07:07.628
you're not worth saving.

07:07.661 --> 07:08.896
- What, after everything
I've done for you?

07:08.929 --> 07:10.798
After all the dealings
we've had together?

07:10.831 --> 07:12.733
- Phil, dear, I'm sorry.

07:12.766 --> 07:14.668
You're done.
Show him out.

07:14.702 --> 07:16.770
I'm done?

07:16.804 --> 07:18.472
I wonder what "The New York
Times" would have to say

07:18.506 --> 07:20.508
about that.
- Hey.

07:20.541 --> 07:22.576
You think you can pull
this shit with me?

07:22.610 --> 07:26.714
I've got two words for you,
Nicholas Hull.

07:26.747 --> 07:27.815
- Are--are you saying--

07:27.848 --> 07:29.617
- I'm saying you should go back

07:29.650 --> 07:32.553
to your ambulance-chasing
law firm in Rockaway.

07:32.586 --> 07:33.887
A bohunk law career is better

07:33.921 --> 07:36.256
than ending up
a sidewalk pancake.

07:36.289 --> 07:37.891
Don't you think?

07:40.928 --> 07:46.233
*

07:46.266 --> 07:50.003
Find me Woody Hammond.

07:56.977 --> 07:57.978
- You wanted to see us,
Lieutenant?

07:58.011 --> 08:03.717
- Yeah.
Shut the door.

08:03.751 --> 08:05.953
You know,

08:05.986 --> 08:07.721
you can get all
the vitamins you need

08:07.755 --> 08:09.657
from just a couple
of eggs a day.

08:09.690 --> 08:11.525
No supplements.

08:11.559 --> 08:13.093
Two boiled eggs
and you're good to go.

08:13.126 --> 08:15.796
- I hate eggs.

08:15.829 --> 08:20.634
Seriously, I always have.

08:22.870 --> 08:24.672
- Mmm.

08:24.705 --> 08:26.807
I'm gonna cut to the chase.

08:26.840 --> 08:29.076
Nicholas Hull.

08:29.109 --> 08:32.680
You guys paid him a visit
before his death?

08:32.713 --> 08:34.715
- We were following up
on a lead.

08:34.748 --> 08:35.949
- You don't have a case
involving him,

08:35.983 --> 08:39.620
so chime in on
the truth any time.

08:39.653 --> 08:43.757
- We believe his corporation is
involved in human trafficking.

08:43.791 --> 08:48.596
- So I suppose you've spoken
to the FBI about this?

08:50.030 --> 08:52.299
If Nicholas Hull was
involved in trafficking,

08:52.332 --> 08:54.602
and you guys know anything
that can help,

08:54.635 --> 08:57.805
I suggest that you
hand it over to the FBI.

08:57.838 --> 09:01.842
Then we can get back
to doing what we do best here,

09:01.875 --> 09:06.046
closing homicide cases.

09:06.079 --> 09:08.081
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

09:11.752 --> 09:13.086
- All right.

09:19.092 --> 09:20.794
Matsuyama.

09:20.828 --> 09:24.064
A word.

09:24.097 --> 09:25.799
That visit to Hull,

09:25.833 --> 09:29.136
have anything to do
with your mother's death?

09:29.169 --> 09:30.804
- No, sir.

09:32.640 --> 09:37.077
'Cause I know when one
of my troops is broken.

09:37.110 --> 09:38.846
If you need to take
some time off--

09:38.879 --> 09:40.814
- I'm good.

09:40.848 --> 09:42.850
Thank you, sir.

09:42.883 --> 09:44.918
Can I go now?

09:44.952 --> 09:48.188
- Yeah.

09:52.826 --> 09:56.830
- Yeah, still weaning off
the propofol.

09:56.864 --> 09:59.166
We need to get Sabine
out of prison.

09:59.199 --> 10:01.735
- Tess--
- There has to be a way.

10:01.769 --> 10:02.936
- Even if we figure out
who Shadowman is,

10:02.970 --> 10:04.772
we still need to prove
that Sabine--

10:04.805 --> 10:08.876
- That he was the one to kill
Kumiko and not Sabine.

10:08.909 --> 10:11.044
I don't even know
how we do that.

10:11.078 --> 10:15.082
- None of us do.

10:15.115 --> 10:19.152
I'm getting sick of adding
people to this wall.

10:23.724 --> 10:26.126
- I was thinking of
tracking down Woody Hammond.

10:26.159 --> 10:29.129
Why?

10:29.162 --> 10:31.799
- He used to recruit Dreamers
for Hull-Bedford.

10:31.832 --> 10:33.801
Maybe he's run up
against our Shadowman.

10:33.834 --> 10:36.670
He won't tell you anything.

10:36.704 --> 10:39.106
I don't think you'll even
get past the doorman.

10:39.139 --> 10:42.876
- I wasn't thinking of talking
to him in the real world.

10:45.913 --> 10:47.247
- If we can figure out
where he hides out

10:47.280 --> 10:50.884
in the dreamscape, yeah.

10:50.918 --> 10:53.754
- I have an idea where you
could find him.

10:55.756 --> 10:57.024
Guten Abend, Herr Hammond?

10:57.057 --> 10:58.692
Lange nicht gesehen.

10:58.726 --> 11:01.929
- Agreed, Manfred.
- Wir haben Sie vermisst.

11:01.962 --> 11:09.036
*

11:12.840 --> 11:15.042
Ihr Lieblingsgetrank.

11:15.075 --> 11:17.477
Auf Kosten des Haus,
naturlich.

11:20.881 --> 11:22.916
Josephine Baker.

11:22.950 --> 11:25.185
- * Pack up all my care
and woe *

11:25.218 --> 11:27.921
* Here I go,
singing low *

11:27.955 --> 11:32.860
* Bye, bye, blackbird

11:32.893 --> 11:35.128
* Where somebody waits for me

11:35.162 --> 11:37.898
* Sugar is sweet, so is he

11:37.931 --> 11:41.969
* Bye, bye, blackbird

11:47.507 --> 11:47.841
.

11:47.875 --> 11:48.441
- Hey, look, Sutton is right.

11:49.777 --> 11:51.211
You should've never
gotten involved.

11:51.244 --> 11:52.780
You are risking your career.

11:52.813 --> 11:55.348
- I won't be if we keep it
on the DL.

11:55.382 --> 11:56.850
Work on other cases,

11:56.884 --> 11:58.786
give Sutton nothing
to complain about.

11:58.819 --> 12:00.320
One of us always at the desks,

12:00.353 --> 12:01.889
since you know
he'll be watching.

12:01.922 --> 12:04.825
But we follow up
on what we got.

12:04.858 --> 12:09.329
Problem is, with Hull dead,
we got nothing.

12:09.362 --> 12:11.198
- Hull's high dive,

12:11.231 --> 12:12.432
I have to think it's Shadowman.

12:12.465 --> 12:14.334
Orchestrated
by Taylor Bennett.

12:14.367 --> 12:16.336
- If he killed Hull
for Bennett,

12:16.369 --> 12:18.138
then everyone
killed by Shadowman

12:18.171 --> 12:19.339
should be
connected to her.

12:19.372 --> 12:21.374
- The reporter and
the doctor, that's it.

12:21.408 --> 12:24.477
Morrison?
No.

12:24.511 --> 12:27.480
- He's connected
to Bennett somehow.

12:27.514 --> 12:30.350
We must've missed something.

12:30.383 --> 12:31.819
- Possible.

12:31.852 --> 12:33.921
Or it was some kind of
audition for Bennett.

12:33.954 --> 12:38.158
Show what he's capable of.

12:48.468 --> 12:51.571
- Her mother wasn't killed
by Taylor Bennett.

12:51.604 --> 12:55.342
Shadowman killed her because
he knew she could identify him.

12:55.375 --> 12:58.846
She could find him in dreams,
just like James did.

12:58.879 --> 13:03.283
Sabine was just
collateral to him.

13:04.551 --> 13:07.921
- But your mother
couldn't speak.

13:07.955 --> 13:10.924
- In her dreams she did.

13:10.958 --> 13:12.492
*

13:12.525 --> 13:14.227
You sure you still
wanna keep going with this?

13:14.261 --> 13:16.263
- Look at me.

13:16.296 --> 13:19.266
I need to solve this
as much as you.

13:19.299 --> 13:26.339
*

13:36.316 --> 13:43.390
*

13:56.904 --> 14:03.944
*

14:07.480 --> 14:10.517
- Shoo.

14:14.587 --> 14:15.956
You have information?

14:15.989 --> 14:18.358
- Woody Hammond,
he's in Jersey.

14:18.391 --> 14:21.461
He went through a toll booth.
He clocked his fast pass.

14:21.494 --> 14:24.231
It's a bit pathetic,
don't you think?

14:24.264 --> 14:26.666
Truck stop motel?

14:26.699 --> 14:31.004
- He likes lot lizards.
I'm not surprised.

14:31.038 --> 14:33.473
How long has he been there?
- Oh, not long.

14:33.506 --> 14:35.408
No visitors so far,
paid or unpaid.

14:35.442 --> 14:38.946
- Mm.

14:38.979 --> 14:41.448
He could choose any hotel
anywhere in the world.

14:41.481 --> 14:43.050
Why that one?

14:43.083 --> 14:45.585
- I guess he doesn't care
where he sleeps.

14:45.618 --> 14:48.655
- Or where he dreams.

14:48.688 --> 14:51.058
Tell your guys to stand down.

14:51.091 --> 14:54.561
This calls for a specialist.

14:56.529 --> 14:57.965
- We're good.

14:57.998 --> 15:00.467
1 down,
12 more cases to go.

15:00.500 --> 15:01.935
Boom.

15:01.969 --> 15:03.403
- Morrison obviously
never received

15:03.436 --> 15:05.238
a "best boss"
coffee mug.

15:05.272 --> 15:07.540
He laid off about 50 people
right before his wife's death.

15:07.574 --> 15:08.675
Downsizing.

15:08.708 --> 15:10.410
Couple of them
didn't take it well.

15:10.443 --> 15:12.045
Already checked up
on two of them.

15:12.079 --> 15:13.580
Nothing to report.

15:13.613 --> 15:15.515
Number three looks interesting.

15:15.548 --> 15:17.517
Take a look at this.

15:17.550 --> 15:19.052
- "Eat shit, Morrison."

15:19.086 --> 15:21.588
That's a nice way
to endorse a check.

15:21.621 --> 15:23.323
"Pay to the order
of Tom Dolan."

15:23.356 --> 15:25.258
- Yeah, checked up on
the address on the check.

15:25.292 --> 15:26.994
House turned out
to be a short sale.

15:30.430 --> 15:33.300
Matsuyama.

15:33.333 --> 15:34.734
You do?

15:34.767 --> 15:38.405
Yep, hold on.

15:38.438 --> 15:41.975
Hold on.

15:42.009 --> 15:44.544
Yeah.

15:44.577 --> 15:46.313
Got it.

15:46.346 --> 15:47.547
No new address on Dolan.

15:47.580 --> 15:49.582
- Wife's address.

15:49.616 --> 15:51.351
She filed for divorce.

15:51.384 --> 15:53.086
- The Bronx: that's far
from the old address.

15:53.120 --> 15:55.022
- Yeah, I'll follow up on this.
- No.

15:55.055 --> 15:57.024
Lieutenant's already sniffing
around, asking where you went.

15:57.057 --> 15:59.626
- The ME lab.

15:59.659 --> 16:00.660
You're welcome.

16:00.693 --> 16:02.562
I'll talk to the wife.

16:02.595 --> 16:05.698
You escort our newly confessed
murderer down to booking.

16:05.732 --> 16:07.067
Go.

16:07.100 --> 16:09.036
And give me my pen.
- Nope.

16:09.069 --> 16:11.638
- And try closing a case,
maybe.

16:11.671 --> 16:15.075
I can't do all the work
around here.

16:22.182 --> 16:25.518
- I like your hair.

16:25.552 --> 16:27.420
- It's what all the girls
on suicide watch

16:27.454 --> 16:31.491
are doing these days.

16:33.793 --> 16:36.096
- Sabine.

16:36.129 --> 16:38.065
- You shouldn't have come.

16:38.098 --> 16:40.133
- I had to.
You know that.

16:43.403 --> 16:46.439
What's the point?

16:46.473 --> 16:48.675
- Taka told me what happened.

16:48.708 --> 16:52.179
- Taka needs
to forget about me.

16:52.212 --> 16:54.747
You all need
to forget about me.

16:54.781 --> 16:56.483
- We can't.

16:56.516 --> 16:58.118
- Well, try harder.

16:58.151 --> 17:00.487
- Prisoner will be seated
or returned to her cell.

17:00.520 --> 17:04.591
- She's sorry.
Sit, Sabine, sit, please.

17:15.535 --> 17:18.671
I remember once, I was, uh,

17:18.705 --> 17:21.141
seven or eight.

17:21.174 --> 17:23.443
You were 12.

17:23.476 --> 17:27.547
I saw two red eyes staring
at me in the corner of my room.

17:28.848 --> 17:30.517
I'd never been so scared
in my life.

17:30.550 --> 17:34.787
I thought it was a demon
or a monster,

17:34.821 --> 17:39.726
or something coming to kill me.

17:39.759 --> 17:41.494
Turned out to be a raccoon.
- Raccoon.

17:41.528 --> 17:45.698
- Yeah.
- I remember.

17:45.732 --> 17:48.401
- And I ran into your room,

17:48.435 --> 17:51.804
screaming, I think.

17:51.838 --> 17:56.176
Jumped into your bed and...

17:56.209 --> 17:58.178
And you held me tight.

18:00.247 --> 18:03.883
You told me you'd never
let anything happen to me.

18:05.785 --> 18:08.421
Yeah, you slept on my bed
for nearly a month.

18:08.455 --> 18:11.191
*

18:11.224 --> 18:14.761
- Because that's
what sisters do.

18:14.794 --> 18:19.232
That's what you told me.

18:19.266 --> 18:24.437
That's why I'm here.

18:24.471 --> 18:25.805
- Tess.

18:25.838 --> 18:30.477
- You know there's no way
I'll give up on you.

18:30.510 --> 18:33.146
You're my sister, you're like--

18:33.180 --> 18:37.250
You're like my arm.

18:37.284 --> 18:39.719
You're a part of me.

18:39.752 --> 18:41.488
- But I'm not.

18:41.521 --> 18:44.491
- You know what I mean.

18:44.524 --> 18:46.293
*

18:46.326 --> 18:51.198
- Tess, there's something
that I need to tell you.

18:54.601 --> 18:56.803
- We're not sisters.

18:56.836 --> 18:59.472
*

18:59.506 --> 19:02.242
Charlotte isn't your mother.

19:02.275 --> 19:06.246
You were brought to Aeskyton
when you were three years old.

19:06.279 --> 19:13.253
*

19:17.590 --> 19:18.758
- Because this is the last time

19:18.791 --> 19:20.593
we're ever gonna
see each other.

19:20.627 --> 19:22.229
- Don't say that.

19:22.262 --> 19:26.199
- I'm not gonna
survive this place.

19:26.233 --> 19:28.635
I know myself.

19:28.668 --> 19:30.937
I needed you to know
the truth before I leave.

19:30.970 --> 19:32.805
- Stop talking like that.

19:32.839 --> 19:34.641
We're gonna get you
out of here.

19:34.674 --> 19:37.277
We--we're not giving up on you.
Taka will never give up.

19:37.310 --> 19:40.980
- Taka should never
have met me.

19:41.013 --> 19:43.316
There's nothing
that you or he can do

19:43.350 --> 19:47.320
to change what's
happened to me.

19:47.354 --> 19:49.222
You know that.

19:49.256 --> 19:52.892
*

19:52.925 --> 19:57.830
One way or the other,
I'm going to die in here.

19:57.864 --> 20:04.837
*

20:04.871 --> 20:08.241
I'm ready.

20:08.275 --> 20:10.577
- Sabine.

20:13.813 --> 20:16.849
I love you.

20:19.652 --> 20:22.855
No matter what,

20:22.889 --> 20:25.958
we'll always be sisters.

20:25.992 --> 20:29.629
Always.

20:29.662 --> 20:36.736
*

20:44.644 --> 20:50.883
*

20:53.620 --> 20:53.753
.

20:53.786 --> 20:54.387
- * Sugar sweet, so is he

20:55.755 --> 20:59.992
* Bye, bye, blackbird

21:00.026 --> 21:04.063
* No one here can love
or understand me *

21:04.096 --> 21:05.732
- Hey, Woody.

21:09.101 --> 21:11.504
- You used to talk
to Tess about this place.

21:11.538 --> 21:15.342
The era, the nightlife.

21:15.375 --> 21:17.076
Isn't that Mayor Harding?

21:17.109 --> 21:20.647
- It's my dream.
I can do what I want.

21:20.680 --> 21:22.449
What do you want, Burton?

21:22.482 --> 21:25.017
- Would it sound strange
if I said help?

21:26.653 --> 21:29.356
- I should've come to you
in the first place.

21:29.389 --> 21:31.758
I wanted
to bring down the Firm.

21:31.791 --> 21:34.427
Now Nicholas Hull is dead.

21:34.461 --> 21:37.063
- And I suppose you're gonna
explain how this is my problem.

21:37.096 --> 21:39.732
- Dreamers are being
kidnapped and sold.

21:39.766 --> 21:42.502
How much do you have to do
with that?

21:42.535 --> 21:43.770
- I'm not interested
in people doing things

21:43.803 --> 21:45.505
against their will.

21:45.538 --> 21:47.640
- You've controlled people
in dreams before.

21:49.776 --> 21:54.614
- You really must be desperate
to be asking me for help.

21:54.647 --> 21:57.517
- Maybe I am.

21:57.550 --> 22:00.119
- Not so much for that knight
in shining armor, are you?

22:00.152 --> 22:03.122
- I'm just a man like you who
understands when he needs help.

22:03.155 --> 22:04.791
Taylor Bennet's
taking Dreamers.

22:04.824 --> 22:06.693
Sedating them,
impregnating them,

22:06.726 --> 22:08.428
and making Dreamer babies

22:08.461 --> 22:10.597
Ludicrous.

22:10.630 --> 22:13.466
- You forget what happened
to Tess?

22:13.500 --> 22:16.903
You tried to sell James
to the highest bidder.

22:16.936 --> 22:20.573
You said people at the Firm
were untouchable.

22:20.607 --> 22:23.543
Not so much,
based on today.

22:23.576 --> 22:25.712
Maybe that's why
you're out here,

22:25.745 --> 22:27.113
hiding.

22:27.146 --> 22:29.382
- Dutifully noted.

22:29.416 --> 22:31.117
- * Your baby's coming home
tonight *

22:31.150 --> 22:35.488
* Blackbird, blackbird

22:35.522 --> 22:40.860
* Blackbird, bye, bye

22:47.567 --> 22:50.637
*

22:50.670 --> 22:52.705
- But we don't know where
Tommy is; I told you.

22:52.739 --> 22:54.407
- I understand, Mrs. Dolan.

22:54.441 --> 22:55.908
I was just hoping maybe
you can give me an idea

22:55.942 --> 22:58.945
of where to look for him.

22:58.978 --> 23:01.147
- Tommy's not in trouble,
is he?

23:01.180 --> 23:05.485
- I just wanna talk to him.

23:05.518 --> 23:08.855
I understand you
and Mr. Dolan are separated.

23:11.891 --> 23:14.561
*

23:14.594 --> 23:15.595
- We don't like
to talk about that.

23:15.628 --> 23:17.163
- I'm sorry.

23:17.196 --> 23:20.467
- You have to understand,
Tommy's a good man.

23:20.500 --> 23:22.969
But when he lost his job,
he couldn't handle it.

23:23.002 --> 23:24.871
I still worry
about him every day.

23:24.904 --> 23:27.740
- Worry about a man you filed
a restraining order against?

23:31.644 --> 23:34.146
He pushed me.
That's all Emily knows.

23:36.949 --> 23:40.453
*

23:40.487 --> 23:43.890
I know these things
are hard to talk about.

23:43.923 --> 23:45.892
- I kept hoping he'd get
another good job,

23:45.925 --> 23:48.928
that things would go back
to the way they were.

23:48.961 --> 23:51.764
They got worse.

23:51.798 --> 23:53.600
- Did he ever hurt
your daughter?

23:53.633 --> 23:55.935
No, never.

23:55.968 --> 23:58.971
- Then why was she part
of the restraining order?

24:01.207 --> 24:02.709
Tommy's a good father,
but I needed to get him

24:02.742 --> 24:04.210
out of our lives.

24:04.243 --> 24:05.945
I couldn't take the chance,
not with her.

24:09.215 --> 24:12.952
- He's not supposed to.

24:17.957 --> 24:20.660
- Didn't my mom answer
all your questions?

24:20.693 --> 24:22.962
- She did.

24:24.831 --> 24:27.800
I know it must be difficult
seeing your parents break up.

24:29.836 --> 24:31.904
Your parents are divorced?

24:31.938 --> 24:34.507
- I never had a dad.

24:34.541 --> 24:41.581
*

24:43.716 --> 24:47.954
- He could be.

24:47.987 --> 24:50.222
*

24:50.256 --> 24:54.527
I just need to make sure
he's not gonna hurt anybody,

24:54.561 --> 24:56.929
including you or your mother.

24:56.963 --> 24:58.531
- He would never hurt me.

25:01.701 --> 25:05.805
You know, you'd be helping him
if you told me you have.

25:05.838 --> 25:08.775
- We don't talk that much.

25:08.808 --> 25:10.910
He lives in some
homeless shelter.

25:10.943 --> 25:14.947
That's all I know.

25:14.981 --> 25:16.583
- Okay.

25:16.616 --> 25:18.818
Well...

25:18.851 --> 25:22.088
If you talk to him,

25:22.121 --> 25:24.090
will you give me a call?

25:24.123 --> 25:29.028
- Like I said, I don't talk
to him that much anymore.

25:29.061 --> 25:32.765
*

25:32.799 --> 25:37.069
- Okay.

25:37.103 --> 25:44.310
*

25:45.344 --> 25:46.846
It's pretty obvious
Dolan's wife

25:46.879 --> 25:48.314
is still afraid
of the guy.

25:48.347 --> 25:50.016
- Well, then we might be
on the right track.

25:50.049 --> 25:54.086
- And the daughter is
definitely hiding something.

25:54.120 --> 25:58.925
All right, there are more than
20 homeless shelters

25:58.958 --> 26:01.360
in Manhattan.

26:01.393 --> 26:05.031
- Almost as many.
19.

26:05.064 --> 26:07.099
Three of them are
women's shelters.

26:07.133 --> 26:08.635
We can cross those off.

26:08.668 --> 26:09.969
- Come on.
I'll start in the Bronx.

26:10.002 --> 26:12.705
You start
calling Manhattan.

26:15.742 --> 26:22.815
*

26:27.654 --> 26:34.694
*

26:38.998 --> 26:46.072
*

26:47.974 --> 26:51.043
[tense music builds
to crescendo]

26:53.680 --> 26:53.980
.

26:56.716 --> 27:00.753
*

27:00.787 --> 27:03.690
- Not much I can tell you,
Detective.

27:03.723 --> 27:05.224
I'm afraid Tom Dolan's one of
the unfortunate ones

27:05.257 --> 27:06.726
who falls through the cracks
in the system.

27:06.759 --> 27:09.195
- For a while.

27:09.228 --> 27:11.097
Psychological breaks
are not uncommon.

27:11.130 --> 27:13.365
Most times it's the cause
of homelessness.

27:13.399 --> 27:16.335
I suggested he speak
to our therapist on staff.

27:16.368 --> 27:18.104
Next thing I know,
he's gone.

27:18.137 --> 27:19.438
Probably back on the street
at this point.

27:19.471 --> 27:22.241
- A couple of months ago.

27:22.274 --> 27:25.177
Kept saying he made a man
bite off his tongue.

27:25.211 --> 27:27.313
Said he did it in a dream.

27:27.346 --> 27:30.116
Crazy, right?

27:37.023 --> 27:41.728
*

27:41.761 --> 27:44.697
Mr. Ongaro?

27:44.731 --> 27:47.734
I just wanna ask you
a few questions.

27:47.767 --> 27:50.069
Do you remember a Tom Dolan?

27:50.102 --> 27:51.470
He was here with you
a few months ago,

27:51.503 --> 27:53.139
slept in the bunk next to you

27:53.172 --> 27:55.808
right around the time
of your accident.

27:55.842 --> 28:03.049
*

28:09.455 --> 28:13.192
*

28:13.225 --> 28:16.428
- I understand that.

28:16.462 --> 28:19.198
Do you remember the dream?

28:19.231 --> 28:22.168
*

28:22.201 --> 28:23.770
Do you remember this man?

28:28.507 --> 28:32.444
*

28:32.478 --> 28:34.446
Yeah.

28:34.480 --> 28:36.215
She was asleep, so I went out

28:36.248 --> 28:38.517
and when I came back
I found this.

28:38.550 --> 28:40.887
What was she wearing?

28:40.920 --> 28:43.055
- Something of mine,
I don't know.

28:44.456 --> 28:46.258
- I went to see Sabine.

28:48.127 --> 28:50.797
- She did, but she told me it
was for the last time.

28:52.164 --> 28:54.901
We have to get her
out of there.

28:54.934 --> 28:57.136
How do we do that?
- I don't know.

28:57.169 --> 28:59.071
That's why Lainie
was so important.

28:59.105 --> 29:00.840
At this point,
she's our only witness.

29:00.873 --> 29:02.775
- She doesn't
remember anything.

29:02.809 --> 29:04.777
- Yeah, right now,
but in a couple of days--

29:04.811 --> 29:06.412
- In a couple of days.

29:06.445 --> 29:08.247
I can't remember.
It's been eight years.

29:08.280 --> 29:09.816
- You're right,
you can't remember,

29:09.849 --> 29:12.351
and maybe Lainie never will,
but she isn't safe.

29:12.384 --> 29:14.353
Her kidnappers
will be looking for her.

29:14.386 --> 29:18.090
- And for the baby.
I know.

29:18.124 --> 29:20.392
So did Lainie, read the note.

29:22.594 --> 29:24.130
- "Thanks for caring,

29:24.163 --> 29:26.198
but I'll take my chances
on the outside."

29:26.232 --> 29:28.801
*

29:31.838 --> 29:34.841
- Noch eine Flasche,
Herr Hammond?

29:44.450 --> 29:47.854
Je te pardonne.

29:47.887 --> 29:50.522
- I wish I really was.

29:50.556 --> 29:54.393
- Je t'aime.

29:56.896 --> 30:00.266
- Beaucoup beaucoup.

30:00.299 --> 30:07.373
*

30:11.510 --> 30:18.584
*

30:19.551 --> 30:21.888
- Allume-moi.

30:21.921 --> 30:25.291
- Oh, I will.

30:25.324 --> 30:32.364
*

30:36.502 --> 30:43.575
*

30:50.950 --> 30:54.286
*

30:59.525 --> 31:06.598
*

31:13.639 --> 31:17.343
*

31:17.376 --> 31:19.545
- Woody, stop the fire.

31:22.014 --> 31:23.382
I don't understand.

31:23.415 --> 31:25.317
Why can't I stop it?

31:25.351 --> 31:27.619
- It's not in the dream.

31:27.653 --> 31:29.455
Wake up!

31:37.563 --> 31:40.499
Oh.

31:40.532 --> 31:47.606
*

31:51.210 --> 31:51.377
.

31:51.410 --> 31:52.011
- There may have been others,

31:53.379 --> 31:55.081
but so far the guy
at the shelter

31:55.114 --> 31:56.582
looks like
Dolan's first victim.

31:56.615 --> 31:58.384
- And he's only been doing this
stuff for a couple of months?

31:58.417 --> 32:00.252
Is that normal,

32:00.286 --> 32:02.121
this late in life?

32:02.154 --> 32:03.555
- Well, there's no set standard

32:03.589 --> 32:05.357
when someone figures out
their ability.

32:05.391 --> 32:09.228
It just--
it comes to you one day.

32:09.261 --> 32:11.097
- Weird.

32:14.433 --> 32:17.103
- Time to call it a day.

32:17.136 --> 32:19.205
Do you wanna grab something
on the way?

32:19.238 --> 32:22.074
- Sure.

32:27.246 --> 32:28.547
Change of plan--you can drop
me off at my place.

32:28.580 --> 32:30.349
- Aren't you afraid
of Shadowman?

32:30.382 --> 32:34.120
- Yeah, but, dude,
your couch is killing my back.

32:34.153 --> 32:35.454
Besides, Christy called,

32:35.487 --> 32:40.259
and I figured I should
make an appearance.

32:40.292 --> 32:42.628
Fine, I miss her like hell.

32:42.661 --> 32:45.197
- Funny, I was getting
used to having you around.

32:45.231 --> 32:47.566
- Bullshit.

32:47.599 --> 32:49.535
- It's Burton.

32:49.568 --> 32:51.303
He wants to meet at Boerg's.

32:51.337 --> 32:53.039
Now.

32:53.072 --> 32:54.473
- Awesome.

32:57.509 --> 32:59.511
*

33:03.049 --> 33:04.550
*

33:04.583 --> 33:07.319
- You shouldn't be surprised,
Mr. Dolan.

33:07.353 --> 33:09.021
- Then why did you
call me here?

33:09.055 --> 33:11.290
- Because Woody Hammond
is alive.

33:11.323 --> 33:12.524
- I understand that.

33:12.558 --> 33:14.560
- Only one of us does.

33:14.593 --> 33:17.529
- It was more complicated
than I expected.

33:17.563 --> 33:20.166
Someone else was there.

33:20.199 --> 33:24.370
A tall black guy.
He helped Hammond.

33:24.403 --> 33:26.638
I can complete this assignment.

33:26.672 --> 33:30.176
- And we will pay you
when it is completed.

33:30.209 --> 33:32.544
How's your daughter doing?

33:32.578 --> 33:34.113
*

33:34.146 --> 33:35.481
- She's fine.

33:35.514 --> 33:39.051
- Emily goes
to East Bronx High.

33:39.085 --> 33:42.188
Isn't that right?

33:42.221 --> 33:44.523
You must really love her.

33:44.556 --> 33:46.592
- Of course I do.

33:46.625 --> 33:48.160
- Learning institutions
can be fickle

33:48.194 --> 33:50.196
with their scholarships.

33:50.229 --> 33:54.466
One little slight, maybe NYU
changes their mind about her.

33:54.500 --> 33:58.570
*

33:58.604 --> 34:01.207
- Hammond will be
taken care of.

34:01.240 --> 34:03.409
- Then there's nothing
to worry about,

34:03.442 --> 34:06.245
for you or your daughter.

34:06.278 --> 34:08.547
*

34:10.449 --> 34:14.386
Ouch.

34:14.420 --> 34:16.355
- You should go to a hospital.

34:16.388 --> 34:19.091
- I'd rather not draw any more
attention to myself right now.

34:19.125 --> 34:21.227
I'm lucky nobody followed me
from Jersey.

34:21.260 --> 34:23.262
I picked a place I didn't think
anyone would find me.

34:23.295 --> 34:25.597
- But someone did.
- Or something.

34:25.631 --> 34:27.633
- It's definitely a person.

34:27.666 --> 34:29.568
Another Dreamer.

34:29.601 --> 34:31.603
- One effing powerful Dreamer.

34:31.637 --> 34:33.672
- And dangerous too.

34:33.705 --> 34:35.507
We call him Shadowman.

34:35.541 --> 34:37.509
- Sounds like something
out of a bad horror movie.

34:37.543 --> 34:40.112
- Not too far off.

34:40.146 --> 34:41.747
He's kind of a dream assassin.

34:41.780 --> 34:45.251
Influences people to kill
others or commit suicide.

34:46.685 --> 34:49.588
Now, I'm sure she has an army
of dream assassins

34:49.621 --> 34:51.390
on her payroll.

34:51.423 --> 34:52.724
- Taylor Bennett.

34:52.758 --> 34:55.661
I seem to have fallen
into her disfavor.

34:57.563 --> 34:59.265
- Apparently not anymore.

34:59.298 --> 35:02.268
- I'm hoping this changes
your mind about helping us.

35:02.301 --> 35:04.403
- I'm not exactly
the helpful type.

35:06.338 --> 35:08.407
Maybe I won't be around to save
your self-centered ass

35:08.440 --> 35:09.775
next time.

35:12.611 --> 35:16.548
- It's Tess.

35:21.520 --> 35:24.790
- Here's Woody.

35:24.823 --> 35:26.758
- I found him right
where you said he'd be.

35:26.792 --> 35:30.496
- Well, that'll teach me
to share.

35:32.331 --> 35:35.167
- Seems your Shadowman
tried to kill me.

35:35.201 --> 35:37.603
- For Taylor Bennett.
Woody works for her.

35:37.636 --> 35:40.439
- Worked.
Past tense.

35:40.472 --> 35:41.773
And I'm not the only one in
this room

35:41.807 --> 35:43.575
who's had dealings
with Bennett either.

35:43.609 --> 35:46.545
- Okay, yes, it's true.

35:46.578 --> 35:49.248
But look at us now.

35:49.281 --> 35:51.717
I think we are in danger.
All of us.

35:51.750 --> 35:53.585
What're we gonna do about it?

35:53.619 --> 35:56.455
What if she sends this
Shadowman after us?

35:56.488 --> 35:58.524
- At least now we know
who he is.

35:58.557 --> 36:01.627
- Some loser named Tom Dolan.
Taka ID'd him.

36:01.660 --> 36:03.595
- We don't know.

36:03.629 --> 36:06.398
Obviously close enough to
whisper kill instructions

36:06.432 --> 36:08.334
to anyone who gets in
Taylor Bennett's way.

36:08.367 --> 36:10.436
- Uh, there was no whispering
going on here.

36:10.469 --> 36:12.804
He was choking
the shit out of me.

36:12.838 --> 36:15.474
- I've never known a Dreamer
who can kill another Dreamer.

36:15.507 --> 36:17.243
- According to you guys,

36:17.276 --> 36:19.778
Dolan has always had other
people kill his victims,

36:19.811 --> 36:21.413
or commit suicide.

36:21.447 --> 36:23.415
- But this time he tried
to do it himself.

36:23.449 --> 36:26.352
That's a first.

36:26.385 --> 36:29.421
- Then he could kill any of us.
- Yeah.

36:29.455 --> 36:32.624
Unless we work together.

36:39.665 --> 36:45.637
*

36:54.346 --> 36:54.513
.

36:57.983 --> 37:00.952
- Hey.

37:00.986 --> 37:02.488
- You're up late.

37:02.521 --> 37:05.291
- I couldn't sleep.

37:05.324 --> 37:06.692
Maybe that's a good thing,

37:06.725 --> 37:08.760
considering what nearly
happened to Woody.

37:10.862 --> 37:14.933
We can't stay awake forever
just to avoid Shadowman.

37:14.966 --> 37:18.837
- I'm starting to think
that this is all just karma.

37:18.870 --> 37:22.441
My karma.

37:22.474 --> 37:24.443
If I hadn't tried to take down
Hull-Bedford,

37:24.476 --> 37:27.446
maybe none of this
would've happened.

37:27.479 --> 37:30.782
You and James,
would still be in Maine,

37:30.816 --> 37:34.720
safe.

37:34.753 --> 37:37.055
- We weren't safe.

37:37.088 --> 37:39.358
We're safer here with you.

37:39.391 --> 37:43.462
- Jeremy showed up right
before the FBI raided the Firm.

37:44.863 --> 37:46.498
I brought you into this, Tess.

37:46.532 --> 37:48.834
Put you and James in danger.

37:48.867 --> 37:50.436
- No, you didn't.
- I did.

37:50.469 --> 37:51.470
- No.
- I did.

37:51.503 --> 37:53.972
- No.

37:54.005 --> 37:56.007
And think of what would've
happened to Lainie

37:56.041 --> 37:57.443
if you hadn't started all this.

37:57.476 --> 38:00.812
- Yeah, but now she's gone,
Tess.

38:00.846 --> 38:02.748
Maybe she's in danger again.

38:02.781 --> 38:05.784
Maybe, but...

38:05.817 --> 38:09.054
It was her decision.

38:09.087 --> 38:13.024
She was right, I wanted her
to stay for myself.

38:13.058 --> 38:16.528
I was hoping maybe if she
remembered something, I--

38:16.562 --> 38:19.798
I could understand
what happened to me.

38:23.068 --> 38:27.339
There's so much I don't know.

38:30.842 --> 38:33.812
You're a good man, Burton.

38:33.845 --> 38:38.116
That's one thing
I know for sure.

38:38.149 --> 38:41.553
- Thank you.

38:44.590 --> 38:51.830
*

39:05.444 --> 39:10.549
*

39:14.586 --> 39:17.489
Taka.

39:17.523 --> 39:18.924
- Don't be angry.

39:18.957 --> 39:21.427
- I told you not to come.
- I know.

39:21.460 --> 39:24.129
- But I had to find you.

39:24.162 --> 39:26.164
And you're here.

39:26.197 --> 39:29.835
- It's the only dream
I have left.

39:29.868 --> 39:32.971
Where I go when
I can't take it anymore.

39:33.004 --> 39:35.974
- I found the man
who did this to you.

39:36.007 --> 39:38.009
You understand?

39:38.043 --> 39:39.445
I found the real killer.

39:39.478 --> 39:42.414
- No, Taka.

39:42.448 --> 39:44.450
No, I'm the real killer.

39:44.483 --> 39:45.617
- You're not.

39:45.651 --> 39:47.653
We know who made you do it.

39:50.722 --> 39:52.991
But none of that matters.

39:53.024 --> 39:54.993
All that matters now

39:55.026 --> 39:56.695
is for us to be together.

39:59.498 --> 40:01.533
All I wanted was you.

40:01.567 --> 40:08.640
*

40:09.207 --> 40:13.912
- * And it echoes
when I breathe *

40:13.945 --> 40:19.718
* Till all you see
is my ghost *

40:19.751 --> 40:24.656
* Empty vessel,
crooked teeth *

40:24.690 --> 40:27.559
* Wish you could see

40:27.593 --> 40:31.229
* And they call me under

40:31.262 --> 40:33.198
*

40:33.231 --> 40:36.968
* And I'm shaking
like a leaf *

40:37.002 --> 40:38.637
*

40:38.670 --> 40:43.642
* And they call me under

40:43.675 --> 40:48.179
* And I wither underneath

40:48.213 --> 40:49.247
*

40:49.280 --> 40:51.049
* In this storm

40:51.082 --> 40:54.152
* I feel it

40:54.185 --> 40:58.056
* And they call me under

40:58.089 --> 40:59.925
*

40:59.958 --> 41:04.663
* And I'm shaking
like a leaf *

41:04.696 --> 41:08.534
* And they call me
underneath *

41:08.567 --> 41:10.235
*

41:10.268 --> 41:13.605
* To this storm

41:13.639 --> 41:20.712
*

41:24.750 --> 41:31.990
*
