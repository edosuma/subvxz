Dear Ms. Höhenfeldt,
Could you think about my offer?

00:34.208 --> 00:38.291
Unfortunately, we're short on time,
and I need the casting video ASAP.

00:38.375 --> 00:41.916
I believe in your potential. Go for it!
Yours, Birger Ritzenhoff

STARTING LINE

01:04.166 --> 01:06.666

01:10.250 --> 01:11.625

01:13.083 --> 01:15.333

01:24.000 --> 01:25.750

01:32.875 --> 01:35.000
<i>And if you don't recover right away,</i>

01:38.833 --> 01:42.458
<i>you'll always keep chasing</i>
<i>that one small mistake.</i>

01:54.916 --> 01:55.916
Good morning.

01:57.916 --> 02:01.166
I just wanted to say
I'm really sorry about last night.

02:01.750 --> 02:05.583
-I don't usually do things like that.
-Things like what?

02:05.666 --> 02:09.458
Don't make it even harder on me.
I already feel like an idiot.

02:09.541 --> 02:11.000
But nothing happened.

02:13.875 --> 02:15.125
That's what you mean.

02:16.250 --> 02:17.083
Sorry.

02:17.750 --> 02:18.583
I mean thanks.

02:24.083 --> 02:25.416
Do you want to come in?

02:26.041 --> 02:27.625
Thanks, but I have to go.

02:33.583 --> 02:36.000
You won't tell Vanessa either, will you?

02:39.125 --> 02:42.750
If that's what you're worried about,
don't be.

02:43.458 --> 02:44.291
Cool.

02:58.416 --> 02:59.250
Mom.

03:00.083 --> 03:00.916
There you are.

03:01.708 --> 03:02.958
This can't be.

03:03.916 --> 03:04.916
What happened?

03:05.500 --> 03:07.958
-It's gone.
-What's gone?

03:08.833 --> 03:11.250
Grandma's watch. Didn't you have it last?

03:11.333 --> 03:12.541
Yeah. It's upstairs.

03:12.625 --> 03:14.125
No, it's not there.

03:15.500 --> 03:18.375
Maybe the burglar took it. I don't know.

03:18.875 --> 03:20.166
How typical of you.

03:21.250 --> 03:24.291
-What is?
-That was a family heirloom!

03:24.375 --> 03:27.250
I was held at gunpoint.
It was traumatizing.

03:27.333 --> 03:30.166
So traumatizing
that you're able to party all night.

03:30.250 --> 03:32.708
-Claire.
-I smell the booze from here.

03:32.791 --> 03:35.000
We really need to go.
The driver's waiting.

03:36.000 --> 03:39.041
-Even if I really hate leaving you--
-Don't touch me.

03:40.833 --> 03:41.958
What did you say?

03:42.458 --> 03:44.458
Don't talk to your father like that.

03:46.166 --> 03:47.250
What's going on?

03:48.625 --> 03:49.666
I feel sick.

03:50.791 --> 03:53.000
Did something happen? Are you pregnant?

03:53.083 --> 03:55.000
No, I'm not pregnant!

04:00.333 --> 04:02.250
-That's just…
-Just leave her be.

04:20.916 --> 04:22.041
Hello?

04:22.125 --> 04:24.000
<i>Hey, Vanessa. It's Lisi.</i>

04:24.083 --> 04:25.750
Hey, Lisi. What's up?

04:26.375 --> 04:28.166
I just wanted to ask how you are.

04:28.250 --> 04:29.750
<i>After last night.</i>

04:29.833 --> 04:31.916
I just saw my dad and had to puke.

04:33.541 --> 04:35.666
<i>I just don't know who I can trust anymore.</i>

04:35.750 --> 04:37.208
Any plans for today?

04:37.291 --> 04:41.416
I have a tough photo shoot soon.
The photographer is a total hothead.

04:42.291 --> 04:44.333
<i>It's also outside in the cold!</i>

04:44.416 --> 04:45.875
If you need any help,

04:46.916 --> 04:48.500
<i>I don't have any plans today.</i>

04:49.625 --> 04:50.458
Yeah?

04:50.541 --> 04:53.833
<i>Sure! How often do you get</i>
<i>the chance to go to a shoot?</i>

04:54.333 --> 04:55.458
<i>And I love fashion.</i>

04:58.416 --> 05:00.041
<i>I can pick you up if you want.</i>

05:01.083 --> 05:02.666
You're a real sweetheart, Lisi.

05:02.750 --> 05:05.333
<i>Not so fucked up like my other friends.</i>

05:06.541 --> 05:08.250
-See you soon, okay?
-See you.

05:33.541 --> 05:35.958
Fuck, I feel so sick.

05:40.625 --> 05:44.250
-What am I doing here?
-You didn't want to go home last night.

05:45.708 --> 05:46.541
Shit.

05:49.291 --> 05:50.791
I ordered us breakfast.

05:53.958 --> 05:57.083
-I don't usually stay the night.
-Relax, we just cuddled.

05:59.750 --> 06:02.333
WHERE WERE YOU LAST NIGHT?
LOOKED EVERYWHERE FOR YOU.

06:02.416 --> 06:03.250
Good morning.

06:03.333 --> 06:05.000
I'M AT WORK, I'LL WRITE YOU LATER!

06:05.083 --> 06:07.000
-That's for you.
-Very generous, Mr. Ziervogel.

06:07.083 --> 06:07.916
Sure thing.

06:09.125 --> 06:11.750
-Did he just call you Ziervogel?
-Yeah, why?

06:11.833 --> 06:13.000
Like this hotel?

06:13.083 --> 06:15.166
-This place belongs to my dad.
-Really?

06:16.083 --> 06:18.125
Correction, used to belong to him.

06:19.125 --> 06:21.375
Brain tumor. It went fast in the end.

06:22.541 --> 06:24.041
Thanks, but I need to go.

06:24.875 --> 06:26.208
Sure? You'll miss out.

06:28.750 --> 06:29.625
Sorry.

06:30.708 --> 06:31.916
About your dad, I mean.

06:36.625 --> 06:37.958
It's really hard for you?

06:39.125 --> 06:40.083
What is?

06:40.833 --> 06:42.125
The whole "feelings" thing.

06:44.666 --> 06:46.333
We'll get there eventually.

06:47.750 --> 06:48.708
Yeah, of course.

07:02.541 --> 07:05.458
Take these to Conny,
and apologize for yesterday.

07:06.833 --> 07:08.250
Why do you care so much?

07:08.333 --> 07:10.541
You can't just stand up the boss of MSAD.

07:11.958 --> 07:14.583
No, you just don't think
I can make it on my own.

07:14.666 --> 07:16.708
Nonsense. Why would you think that?

07:16.791 --> 07:18.916
That's why you want
to set me up with someone.

07:19.000 --> 07:21.041
You don't think I can do it by myself.

07:21.125 --> 07:25.083
I do, but you have to take
the opportunities life gives you.

07:28.000 --> 07:30.375
Your father is in Kitzbühel, by the way.

07:31.000 --> 07:31.833
And?

07:35.041 --> 07:37.750
Get in touch with him.
He'd be happy to see you.

07:38.416 --> 07:41.083
-Only if I bring a Nobel Prize with me.
-Hey!

07:42.416 --> 07:46.041
He's very proud of you.
Even if he doesn't always show it.

07:46.958 --> 07:48.708
Why do you always defend him?

07:49.583 --> 07:51.083
He treated you like dirt.

07:51.583 --> 07:52.750
It's not that simple.

07:52.833 --> 07:56.208
He left us for another woman.
Quite simple, really.

08:00.125 --> 08:01.208
Your father and I,

08:02.666 --> 08:04.416
are from totally different worlds.

08:05.166 --> 08:07.875
He had a much harder life than you and I.

08:08.958 --> 08:10.083
Don't forget that.

08:10.708 --> 08:14.083
Don't worry.
He reminds me about it all the damn time.

08:19.625 --> 08:20.583
Leave them here.

08:21.416 --> 08:22.250
I'll do it.

08:24.791 --> 08:25.708
Thanks.

09:42.791 --> 09:45.791
-I finally get it now.
-What do you finally get?

09:46.291 --> 09:50.875
Mystery girl's name is Ute.
She's 50 years old and has three kids.

09:51.541 --> 09:52.791
She's an actress, okay?

09:52.875 --> 09:54.916
Really? Do I know her?

09:55.666 --> 09:56.833
No.

09:57.375 --> 10:00.583
-What has she been in?
-She's not an actress just yet.

10:01.083 --> 10:02.250
But she's really good.

10:06.875 --> 10:07.916
-Hey.
-Hi.

10:12.208 --> 10:14.333
-Is this your car?
-Yeah.

10:15.708 --> 10:18.541
It's cozy. Very vintage.

10:20.083 --> 10:20.916
Thanks.

10:26.833 --> 10:27.875
What's this?

10:29.375 --> 10:30.541
Mozart Pillows.

10:31.541 --> 10:33.166
You said you like them.

10:33.833 --> 10:36.750
Yeah, but no. I have to be careful now.

10:36.833 --> 10:39.291
My mom sees each pillow I eat.

10:39.791 --> 10:42.208
She's getting more and more difficult.

10:42.291 --> 10:44.791
She flipped out today
because of this damned watch.

10:46.250 --> 10:47.250
What watch?

10:48.041 --> 10:52.000
Some family heirloom from her grandma.
The burglar pocketed it.

10:52.083 --> 10:53.416
The burglar?

10:53.500 --> 10:54.541
Yeah, who else?

10:55.125 --> 10:56.708
And whose fault is it?

10:56.791 --> 10:57.708
Mine.

11:00.333 --> 11:03.583
-Can we get going now? I'm already late.
-Yeah, sorry.

11:28.791 --> 11:30.916
…news. For me, it's the--

11:31.000 --> 11:31.833
Conny.

11:33.291 --> 11:35.000
-Hello.
-Dominik.

11:35.083 --> 11:36.916
-May I?
-If you make it quick.

11:37.000 --> 11:39.750
I'm really sorry
I couldn't make it yesterday.

11:40.250 --> 11:41.083
But…

11:42.916 --> 11:43.791
here you go.

11:46.625 --> 11:49.166
-Your mother has really good taste.
-Thanks.

11:50.541 --> 11:53.541
And I wanted to say
that I'm extremely impressed

11:53.625 --> 11:56.250
by what you built in such a short time.

11:56.333 --> 11:59.750
I mean, MSAD is
really prestigious for a private school.

12:00.833 --> 12:01.708
Thanks.

12:03.500 --> 12:06.125
If you want,
I could show you some of my sketches.

12:06.208 --> 12:08.166
Our appointment was yesterday, Dominik.

12:11.916 --> 12:14.083
It's okay. I was young once too.

12:14.166 --> 12:15.833
It's fine. I'll see you later.

12:15.916 --> 12:18.125
Sorry. Where were we?

12:18.208 --> 12:19.916
Our Russian investors

12:20.000 --> 12:23.375
would like a concrete financial plan
for the next three months.

12:23.458 --> 12:26.000
We have a whole department for that…

12:34.958 --> 12:37.708
-How's Igor doing today?
-It was a rough day.

12:37.791 --> 12:40.000
We'll see if ashtrays go flying again.

12:42.500 --> 12:43.416
Hello.

12:49.416 --> 12:51.291
Thanks. Well, how do I look?

12:51.375 --> 12:52.583
Awesome. Amazing.

12:52.666 --> 12:53.791
I was asking Lisi.

12:56.708 --> 12:58.041
A bit baggy.

13:01.250 --> 13:03.708
It could do with a bit more shape.

13:04.875 --> 13:07.916
There's no time for that.
You look gorgeous!

13:08.625 --> 13:10.458
Well, how are we doing?

13:10.541 --> 13:13.291
-Igor!
-Hello, my darling.

13:13.833 --> 13:15.125
Let me have a look.

13:16.833 --> 13:18.125
What happened there?

13:18.708 --> 13:21.166
I thought it contrasted the contemporary--

13:21.250 --> 13:23.000
Yeah, I get it, but it looks like shit.

13:24.500 --> 13:25.666
And what is that?

13:26.916 --> 13:28.041
-What?
-That!

13:28.125 --> 13:31.375
It looks like a sack
of fucking straw or something.

13:34.750 --> 13:35.583
But it's…

13:36.416 --> 13:38.333
it's what we agreed on.

13:39.000 --> 13:41.500
I could give it a bit of flair.

13:43.291 --> 13:44.125
You could?

13:44.833 --> 13:45.666
Yeah.

13:47.625 --> 13:50.125
Okay, have at it. It can't get any worse.

13:51.958 --> 13:54.041
Come on, get going! We're losing light!

13:55.041 --> 13:55.875
Fucking hell!

13:57.458 --> 13:59.333
You think you know more than me?

13:59.416 --> 14:01.375
No, I just thought that if--

14:01.458 --> 14:03.708
Daphne! Could you just go, please?

14:05.125 --> 14:06.666
You too. Get out of here.

14:07.833 --> 14:08.666
Lisi.

14:09.416 --> 14:11.291
Quickly, please. It's so cold.

14:13.041 --> 14:14.166
All right, so…

14:23.041 --> 14:24.291
Finally, he shows up.

14:24.375 --> 14:26.458
We've gotten far behind.

14:28.791 --> 14:31.041
-How's she doing?
-She's almost ready.

14:31.625 --> 14:33.833
Let's hope for an easy birth.

14:38.875 --> 14:41.041
Say, you know the Ziervogel Hotel?

14:41.125 --> 14:43.958
The slope it sits on,
it used to be ours, right?

14:49.333 --> 14:50.166
Why?

14:51.166 --> 14:52.125
Just because.

14:53.416 --> 14:55.250
Why did we sell it back then?

14:55.333 --> 14:58.000
Too much work.
It wasn't profitable anymore.

14:58.500 --> 14:59.500
Without any help,

15:00.125 --> 15:02.208
three people can't handle all that.

15:03.166 --> 15:05.833
-Why are you asking all of a sudden?
-Just curious.

15:10.833 --> 15:11.916
Voilà.

15:13.333 --> 15:15.291
Wow! Where did you learn to do that?

15:17.291 --> 15:19.791
-I wanted to study fashion.
-Really?

15:20.625 --> 15:23.041
I even had
a scholarship for Saint Martins.

15:23.541 --> 15:25.833
Saint Martins? In London?

15:25.916 --> 15:27.208
-Yeah.
-That's crazy!

15:28.416 --> 15:29.250
And then?

15:30.125 --> 15:34.250
My brother Joseph died, and I didn't want
to leave my parents here alone.

15:36.916 --> 15:39.500
I'm sorry. That must have been awful.

15:44.333 --> 15:45.416
What about you?

15:46.583 --> 15:48.583
How much longer will you put up with this?

15:49.625 --> 15:50.666
What do you mean?

15:51.708 --> 15:53.541
Isn't it really annoying?

15:54.041 --> 15:57.583
Just playing the perfect cover girl?
You have so much more to offer.

15:58.791 --> 16:00.750
-You think so?
-Of course.

16:02.541 --> 16:03.750
One hundred percent.

16:05.208 --> 16:07.625
Don't you want to show
another side of yourself?

16:14.541 --> 16:15.375
What?

16:16.250 --> 16:17.916
Don't laugh, but I…

16:19.083 --> 16:21.833
I really thought
about getting into acting.

16:23.500 --> 16:24.916
Why would I laugh?

16:25.000 --> 16:28.875
Because it's such a cliché.
The model who wants to be an actress.

16:29.375 --> 16:31.333
You wouldn't be the first to make it.

16:32.083 --> 16:33.875
Just look at Charliz Theron.

16:33.958 --> 16:35.458
It's Charlize, honey.

16:35.541 --> 16:37.083
That's what I meant.

16:39.125 --> 16:43.125
A director from the Burgtheater
keeps writing me, Birger Ritzenhoff.

16:43.708 --> 16:44.583
Birger Ritzenhoff?

16:44.666 --> 16:47.083
-Yeah. Cool, right?
-So cool!

16:47.166 --> 16:49.750
I'm not good enough yet
for the fucking Burgtheater.

16:49.833 --> 16:52.250
How would you know if you haven't tried?

16:54.375 --> 16:56.333
Darling! Let me see.

17:01.708 --> 17:02.791
That's more like it.

17:07.375 --> 17:08.250
Have fun.

17:11.666 --> 17:12.625
Stay like that!

17:12.708 --> 17:14.041
A little bit less.

17:14.125 --> 17:15.291
Love it!

17:15.375 --> 17:17.041
Okay, amazing.

17:17.125 --> 17:18.208
One more time.

17:20.416 --> 17:21.541
Yes! Exactly!

17:21.625 --> 17:22.625
Yes!

17:35.083 --> 17:36.916
Hey, do you work here too?

17:37.541 --> 17:39.083
I just drove Vanessa here.

17:39.166 --> 17:41.166
Did she make you her chauffeur?

17:42.875 --> 17:46.583
By the way, nice move yesterday.
You really knocked Pippa out.

17:47.166 --> 17:49.375
Be careful that you're not next.

17:51.583 --> 17:52.583
What do you mean?

17:53.708 --> 17:55.125
A tip from me to you,

17:58.916 --> 18:00.708
I saw you with Dom yesterday.

18:01.708 --> 18:03.583
Koshi! What are you doing here?

18:04.416 --> 18:07.583
I thought I'd pick you up,
and we'd break in my new Benz.

18:07.666 --> 18:10.000
Awesome. We have so much to talk about.

18:10.625 --> 18:12.541
Wait, did you get your license?

18:12.625 --> 18:15.708
I got it along
with my yoga instructor training.

18:17.916 --> 18:19.416
It's so cold.

18:19.500 --> 18:22.166
-Do you want my jacket?
-Absolutely.

18:26.875 --> 18:28.791
-Thank you.
-Let me help you.

18:30.125 --> 18:33.083
Hop on, baby.
My driver is waiting up there.

18:33.166 --> 18:37.083
-Yeah! Are you coming?
-I can't leave my car here.

18:37.166 --> 18:39.083
Okay, too bad. See you, then.

18:47.666 --> 18:48.583
Hold on.

19:00.500 --> 19:01.833
Lisi, how's it going?

19:01.916 --> 19:04.125
Did you swipe a watch at Vanessa's?

19:04.666 --> 19:06.666
<i>-Me?</i>
-Yeah, Hans. You.

19:06.750 --> 19:07.666
No.

19:09.166 --> 19:12.541
<i>-Are you Robin Hood now?</i>
-They have too much anyway.

19:12.625 --> 19:15.291
<i>-No one will notice.</i>
-They already did.

19:16.291 --> 19:20.458
<i>Hans, the pressure is really on now.</i>
<i>They may even realize what we're up to.</i>

19:21.666 --> 19:24.041
-So what should we do now?
<i>-I'm coming.</i>

19:26.958 --> 19:27.791
Damn it!

19:29.791 --> 19:33.208
Why are the languages mixed?
English title and the rest is in German.

19:33.291 --> 19:36.041
-I can fix that right away, Mr. Reid.
-Please.

19:36.125 --> 19:39.083
The lights are too bright.
Play the film after the welcome speech.

19:42.541 --> 19:43.375
Dominik?

19:46.708 --> 19:48.208
Twenty minutes, Mr. Reid.

19:53.708 --> 19:55.250
I didn't know you'd be here.

20:02.041 --> 20:03.458
Regine says hello.

20:04.833 --> 20:06.416
Thanks. How is she?

20:07.500 --> 20:08.333
Good.

20:09.500 --> 20:12.750
Yeah, she's good.
She has a new boyfriend. Nice guy.

20:15.541 --> 20:16.458
And how are you?

20:17.833 --> 20:18.666
I'm good, too.

20:20.458 --> 20:22.833
You're still doing the car design thing?

20:23.750 --> 20:28.000
I am, yeah.
I'm applying to Pasadena again.

20:28.083 --> 20:30.291
I'm afraid the espresso is bitter.

20:31.291 --> 20:33.000
Sorry, I'll bring you a new one.

20:33.625 --> 20:34.666
Pasadena?

20:35.750 --> 20:36.583
Where else?

20:37.583 --> 20:39.250
You must be applying to others?

20:40.500 --> 20:42.583
What if they say no again?

20:44.875 --> 20:47.916
I'll be a neurologist like you.
Would you be happy then?

20:48.666 --> 20:49.875
What does that mean?

20:50.666 --> 20:53.250
It's not about me being happy, but you.

20:53.833 --> 20:54.750
With yourself.

20:55.416 --> 20:57.750
It's about you getting out of this bubble.

20:57.833 --> 21:01.291
-Fighting for something.
-Let me guess, against all odds?

21:01.375 --> 21:02.291
Yes. Exactly.

21:04.041 --> 21:05.708
My apologies again.

21:06.541 --> 21:09.333
But maybe posting photos online
keeps you happy.

21:09.416 --> 21:11.833
With this Vanessa.
That's a real job these days.

21:11.916 --> 21:14.708
"This Vanessa"
is my girlfriend of four years, Dad.

21:22.708 --> 21:24.500
Come on, let's not fight.

21:25.041 --> 21:28.041
I'll be here a bit longer.
We can eat dinner together.

21:30.083 --> 21:30.916
Okay.

21:31.541 --> 21:32.375
Call me.

21:32.458 --> 21:33.291
I'm coming.

21:49.458 --> 21:50.583
How's it going?

21:51.375 --> 21:53.875
The amniotic sac is out.
Won't be long now.

21:54.583 --> 21:57.833
First calf this year.
I hope everything goes well.

21:57.916 --> 22:02.708
-Hans, you have to give me the watch.
-Yeah, okay. Any progress on your end?

22:02.791 --> 22:04.541
I mentioned Joseph.

22:05.458 --> 22:07.708
What? Why?

22:07.791 --> 22:10.541
Better she hears it
from me than someone else.

22:11.833 --> 22:13.375
How did she react?

22:14.416 --> 22:16.083
"Oh my God, how awful!"

22:17.375 --> 22:20.666
-Like Teflon. It all just slides off.
-What did you expect?

22:23.666 --> 22:26.041
Okay, now tell me about your farmer boy.

22:26.125 --> 22:27.666
I want to know everything.

22:28.250 --> 22:32.083
Farmer boy's name is Hans.
The guy from the bonfire last night.

22:34.833 --> 22:38.041
Why aren't you lying in bed
with farmer boy right now?

22:38.125 --> 22:40.708
No idea. I think he's not really into me.

22:40.791 --> 22:44.291
He totally ditched me yesterday.
Or was it this morning?

22:44.375 --> 22:46.375
That makes you even hornier, right?

22:47.041 --> 22:48.333
No, not at all.

22:48.416 --> 22:51.041
Kosh, you love getting rejected.

22:51.708 --> 22:52.916
Maybe a little bit.

22:53.541 --> 22:55.166
Where would you like to go?

22:57.041 --> 22:58.625
We're visiting your farmer boy.

23:01.000 --> 23:03.000
Driver! To Hans' farm!

23:04.166 --> 23:05.875
Do you have an address?

23:11.000 --> 23:12.083
Hi.

23:12.166 --> 23:14.208
-Hello.
-Could you help us?

23:14.291 --> 23:16.333
We're looking for Hans' farm.

23:16.916 --> 23:19.333
Hans? Is that it?

23:20.666 --> 23:22.583
Well, he's around 20 years old.

23:23.333 --> 23:26.791
-He's very handsome, and…
-He doesn't have a milking robot.

23:26.875 --> 23:28.250
No milking robot.

23:28.333 --> 23:32.875
Maybe they mean Hansi Gassner.
He lives here in Kitzbühel.

23:32.958 --> 23:35.583
Hansi Gassner. That must be him.

23:36.666 --> 23:39.750
-What do you want with him?
-Don't be so nosy, Franz.

23:40.666 --> 23:41.666
To buy some eggs.

23:42.875 --> 23:45.041
Thank you. Bye bye!

24:08.333 --> 24:10.125
-Good day.
-Hello.

24:11.166 --> 24:13.625
-I'm looking for Hans.
-What for?

24:14.208 --> 24:15.666
We're friends. I'm Kosh.

24:16.625 --> 24:17.500
You're what?

24:20.041 --> 24:21.208
Kosh is my name.

24:22.208 --> 24:23.291
Kosh Ziervogel.

24:24.750 --> 24:26.416
Did you say Ziervogel?

24:29.958 --> 24:31.375
Is Hans here?

24:32.166 --> 24:33.541
Has she taken the bait?

24:34.083 --> 24:36.625
I fired off
another Birger Ritzenhoff email.

24:37.833 --> 24:39.833
I think I'm starting to get there.

24:40.541 --> 24:43.000
But then Kosh showed up and snagged her.

24:43.083 --> 24:45.666
Thanks to us, they're inseparable again.

24:48.583 --> 24:51.250
-Where were you last night, anyway?
-Hansi!

24:52.625 --> 24:53.583
It's Kosh!

24:54.666 --> 24:55.791
Are you in there?

24:55.875 --> 24:58.375
-You're the farmer boy?
-The what?

24:59.250 --> 25:00.541
He can't see me here.

25:11.666 --> 25:12.625
Hello, cow.

25:13.250 --> 25:16.208
What are you doing here?
Now isn't a good time.

25:17.666 --> 25:19.083
I was bored.

25:19.583 --> 25:20.583
You were bored?

25:21.250 --> 25:22.916
I don't have time right now.

25:23.458 --> 25:25.625
I just wanted to know how you were doing.

25:26.250 --> 25:28.000
You looked a bit rough earlier.

25:31.750 --> 25:34.375
I'm fine. I just had to leave urgently.

25:35.708 --> 25:37.500
Jesus! What's happening there?

25:38.041 --> 25:39.416
A calf's about to be born.

25:39.500 --> 25:41.250
What's coming out?

25:44.916 --> 25:46.000
Come on, help me.

25:47.583 --> 25:48.791
Grab a leg.

25:51.208 --> 25:53.000
Okay, good. Three, two, one.

25:54.750 --> 25:55.875
Okay, pull!

25:57.208 --> 25:58.083
It won't move.

25:58.708 --> 26:00.000
Don't worry.

26:00.500 --> 26:01.625
Come on, that's it.

26:10.833 --> 26:13.291
I got placenta on my Louboutins.

26:22.916 --> 26:24.416
What's its name?

26:25.291 --> 26:28.541
-Just calf.
-You can't just call it calf.

26:29.875 --> 26:30.791
Give it a name.

26:34.250 --> 26:35.375
You look like a…

26:40.333 --> 26:41.250
Bertl.

26:44.041 --> 26:45.041
Howdy, Bertl.

26:48.458 --> 26:49.416
Howdy.

26:56.583 --> 26:58.000
I'd better go now.

26:59.166 --> 27:00.333
That would be best.

27:17.791 --> 27:19.666
MADLMEYER SKI SCHOOL

27:19.750 --> 27:21.041
-Good day.
-Hello.

27:22.250 --> 27:26.416
-My skis need some maintenance.
-Well, the workshop is closed.

27:27.166 --> 27:28.875
Sorry that I can't help you.

27:28.958 --> 27:32.375
Lisi mentioned your shop.
I must have misunderstood.

27:32.458 --> 27:35.333
You know Lisi? Can I pass on a message?

27:36.041 --> 27:39.666
No, thanks. It's okay.
I just wanted to ask how she's doing.

27:40.208 --> 27:43.041
-And you are?
-Dominik. Reid.

27:46.625 --> 27:50.625
Hold on, wait a moment.
Schorsch might make an exception.

27:50.708 --> 27:51.791
-Okay.
-Hold on.

27:54.041 --> 27:56.041
They're actually in great condition.

28:00.083 --> 28:02.708
I wouldn't take a lot off of the edge.

28:06.041 --> 28:07.041
May I ask,

28:08.416 --> 28:10.250
why don't you reopen?

28:11.458 --> 28:13.958
I can't go on the slopes with my leg.

28:14.041 --> 28:15.916
Let alone give lessons.

28:18.041 --> 28:18.875
Look here.

28:20.791 --> 28:21.791
Sharp as a knife.

28:27.750 --> 28:28.958
And even if…

28:32.000 --> 28:34.000
Since Joseph has been gone, it's…

28:37.750 --> 28:39.541
We were a team, he and I.

28:40.125 --> 28:42.500
Now one person is always missing.

28:47.416 --> 28:48.250
All right.

28:51.333 --> 28:53.916
-Here you go.
-What do I owe you?

28:54.000 --> 28:56.291
-No. It's on the house.
-I insist.

28:56.375 --> 28:57.291
I do too.

28:59.416 --> 29:00.250
Okay.

29:01.666 --> 29:03.416
This is total bullshit, Hans.

29:04.041 --> 29:07.625
Yeah, I know.
I had no idea he was in Vanessa's clique.

29:07.708 --> 29:11.958
-Then you show up with him at the party.
-And you still went home with him.

29:12.041 --> 29:16.916
I did. Because I took a sip of his drink.
There was some crazy stuff in it.

29:19.958 --> 29:20.791
It's okay.

29:23.041 --> 29:26.083
But if this is all a game to you,
then tell me now.

29:27.583 --> 29:29.000
You know what Jo meant to me.

29:32.583 --> 29:34.125
I loved him, Lisi.

29:35.583 --> 29:37.791
Not like you did. In a different way.

29:41.333 --> 29:42.166
I know.

29:45.583 --> 29:46.791
Come here.

29:52.208 --> 29:53.041
All right.

29:55.083 --> 29:56.500
Now the watch, please.

29:57.250 --> 30:00.208
-What will you do with it?
-Save your ass.

30:13.500 --> 30:14.958
-Hey, Lisi!
-Hey.

30:17.500 --> 30:20.000
-What did you want again?
-My jacket.

30:21.166 --> 30:22.041
Right.

30:23.083 --> 30:25.083
We're "Sissi and chilling" right now.

30:25.166 --> 30:26.416
Sissi and chill.

30:26.500 --> 30:27.750
Come on in.

30:30.625 --> 30:34.833
<i>Bello, no! Sit in the corner!</i>
<i>Let Xaverl have his breakfast.</i>

30:34.916 --> 30:37.125
-Some shroom chocolate?
-What kind?

30:38.083 --> 30:40.291
Magic mushrooms, sweetie.

30:41.833 --> 30:42.750
Hi, Lisi.

30:43.541 --> 30:45.208
Wirsing's original recipe.

30:45.291 --> 30:48.375
-Don't say that name, Kosh.
-Sorry, Your Highness.

30:48.458 --> 30:50.958
It's a little tradition of ours.
Want some?

30:51.041 --> 30:52.416
I drove here.

30:53.583 --> 30:55.083
You're welcome to stay.

30:55.833 --> 30:56.666
But

30:57.916 --> 31:00.750
you'll have to snack
on some chocolate with us.

31:10.750 --> 31:12.708
You can sleep in the guest room.

31:36.791 --> 31:38.583
How do you know this Ziervogel?

31:39.916 --> 31:40.750
Why?

31:43.375 --> 31:46.833
Arnold, you can't walk away
and leave me to deal with this.

31:49.916 --> 31:51.083
What's this about?

31:53.541 --> 31:55.666
These people are nothing but trouble.

31:57.375 --> 31:59.333
It won't end well, believe me.

32:01.083 --> 32:02.125
"These people?"

32:03.041 --> 32:06.125
I came out over a year ago.
You eventually have to get over it.

32:06.208 --> 32:07.250
That's not it.

32:08.625 --> 32:09.791
Then what?

32:11.166 --> 32:13.166
Hansi, that guy is not good for you.

32:13.708 --> 32:15.041
Please trust us.

32:16.541 --> 32:18.125
So dishonest.

32:18.750 --> 32:20.583
That guy's name is Kosh, by the way!

32:26.541 --> 32:28.291
<i>Why did you run away this afternoon?</i>

32:31.166 --> 32:33.166
<i>Do you really need an explanation?</i>

32:33.250 --> 32:34.875
It's slowly kicking in now.

32:36.541 --> 32:38.541
Hey. I got your food order.

32:39.416 --> 32:40.250
Franz!

32:41.000 --> 32:41.833
Nessa?

32:42.416 --> 32:44.125
Who's this Nessa?

32:45.041 --> 32:47.250
-Okay, what did you take?
-Nothing.

32:47.333 --> 32:49.458
Just a few mushrooms, Franz. Why?

32:51.250 --> 32:54.666
If you haven't noticed,
Kosh and Nessa are unbearable together.

32:56.208 --> 32:59.375
But who's this Nessa, Your Royal Highness?

32:59.916 --> 33:00.750
You see?

33:05.166 --> 33:06.416
<i>I love you.</i>

33:09.416 --> 33:11.083
<i>Will you be my wife?</i>

33:11.875 --> 33:13.500
<i>No. Never!</i>

33:14.083 --> 33:14.958
<i>Why not?</i>

33:16.166 --> 33:18.333
<i>I won't get in the way</i>
<i>of Néné's happiness.</i>

33:18.416 --> 33:20.625
<i>Because I'll never steal her husband.</i>

33:26.083 --> 33:26.916
Lisi?

33:27.000 --> 33:28.166
Are you okay?

33:34.208 --> 33:36.583
I just need the little empress' room.

33:44.916 --> 33:45.791
<i>The watch.</i>

33:48.208 --> 33:49.875
<i>Where should I put it?</i>

33:51.250 --> 33:52.333
<i>It's all right.</i>

33:52.416 --> 33:56.291
<i>Okay, come on. Go on.</i>

34:00.250 --> 34:01.416
<i>Wow!</i>

34:06.875 --> 34:07.708
<i>Tick.</i>

34:07.791 --> 34:09.916
<i>I saw you.</i>

34:10.000 --> 34:12.125
<i>I saw you with Dom.</i>

34:14.416 --> 34:15.916
<i>I saw you.</i>

34:16.000 --> 34:17.333
<i>Kosh saw me.</i>

34:18.875 --> 34:19.916
<i>Focus.</i>

34:20.791 --> 34:22.000
<i>The watch. Where?</i>

34:24.208 --> 34:25.416
<i>I saw you.</i>

34:25.500 --> 34:26.583
<i>The watch. Where?</i>

34:26.666 --> 34:28.666
<i>I saw the watch.</i>

34:28.750 --> 34:29.583
<i>The watch.</i>

34:31.083 --> 34:32.458
<i>Kosh has the watch.</i>

34:54.791 --> 34:55.625
Shit!

34:56.375 --> 34:58.833
-I'm sorry.
-Let me help you.

35:07.875 --> 35:09.083
Isn't this your watch?

35:11.500 --> 35:14.458
-Where did it come from all of a sudden?
-Kosh's bag.

35:18.583 --> 35:21.833
-How?
-The watch clearly fell out of your bag.

35:25.291 --> 35:26.833
It's definitely the watch.

35:30.333 --> 35:32.791
-But how can that be?
-You tell me.

35:36.958 --> 35:39.625
Did you take it at my party?

35:42.458 --> 35:44.250
I wouldn't steal a watch.

35:46.458 --> 35:47.333
Or would I?

35:50.291 --> 35:52.625
Fuck. Is this really happening?

35:57.791 --> 35:59.666
If I did, I'm really sorry.

36:00.166 --> 36:02.166
I'm sure he didn't mean it.

36:03.375 --> 36:04.958
And I trusted you.

36:05.041 --> 36:06.041
Again.

36:07.291 --> 36:09.500
Fuck off, I don't want to see you again!

36:10.000 --> 36:10.833
Nessa,

36:11.416 --> 36:12.583
he needs help.

36:12.666 --> 36:14.250
I need help?

36:19.041 --> 36:20.666
You guys are such assholes.

36:20.750 --> 36:22.333
We're assholes?

36:23.583 --> 36:27.375
I opened every door for you.
I took you with me wherever I went.

36:27.875 --> 36:30.375
And I fucking worried about you.

36:30.458 --> 36:32.833
If you're worried,
why didn't you ever call?

36:32.916 --> 36:35.166
You're starting with this shit again?

36:35.250 --> 36:37.000
Not even when my dad died.

36:40.250 --> 36:41.083
What?

36:41.666 --> 36:42.750
Your dad died?

36:44.166 --> 36:45.000
When?

36:45.083 --> 36:46.083
Four months ago.

36:48.833 --> 36:50.333
Why didn't you tell me?

36:50.416 --> 36:52.916
I called you about a hundred times.

36:53.000 --> 36:55.291
But you pushed me away!

36:55.375 --> 36:58.625
Because of some fucking picture
I posted years ago!

36:59.625 --> 37:01.791
Kosh, I am so sorry.

37:01.875 --> 37:03.625
Fuck your pity!

37:21.208 --> 37:22.625
Oh God. The statues.

37:25.208 --> 37:26.625
My car.

37:28.500 --> 37:30.666
Don't worry. We'll fix it, okay?

37:31.833 --> 37:33.416
I can't deal with all of this.

37:37.541 --> 37:40.375
-I'd better go.
-Wait, I'll drive you home.

37:41.583 --> 37:44.375
-I'll make it home somehow.
-On foot?

37:44.458 --> 37:45.291
Alone?

37:46.250 --> 37:47.083
In the dark?

37:48.208 --> 37:50.125
Please, can I drive you home?

37:51.583 --> 37:52.416
Okay.

38:16.583 --> 38:18.541
I'm sorry about all that drama.

38:20.916 --> 38:23.625
You're thinking,
"What kind of fucked up snobs.

38:24.125 --> 38:27.791
Aren't even aware
that their best friend's dad died?"

38:30.291 --> 38:31.125
I mean…

38:33.958 --> 38:36.541
you know
what it feels like to lose someone.

38:40.125 --> 38:43.500
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said that.

38:50.708 --> 38:51.541
No, it's fine.

38:56.166 --> 38:58.916
And I don't think you're a fucked up snob.

39:00.000 --> 39:02.833
Hey, we're making progress.

39:05.708 --> 39:08.083
But I still don't quite get you.

39:10.791 --> 39:11.625
You know what?

39:13.541 --> 39:14.375
Neither do I.

39:18.083 --> 39:21.958
I always have this feeling
that I have to want something.

39:22.583 --> 39:24.250
And I don't know what it is.

39:26.000 --> 39:28.750
And no matter where I am, I keep thinking,

39:30.583 --> 39:33.083
"No, this isn't me."

39:38.916 --> 39:40.083
You know what I mean?

39:51.000 --> 39:52.916
That kiss last night was a mistake.

39:54.791 --> 39:55.625
Yeah.

39:57.333 --> 39:58.166
A mistake.

40:06.291 --> 40:08.541
<i>Hi, this is Hans.</i>
<i>I'm currently unavailable.</i>

40:08.625 --> 40:11.208
<i>Please leave a message after the beep.</i>

40:23.125 --> 40:25.416
<i>Sometimes, it just takes a tiny spark</i>…

40:28.916 --> 40:31.041
<i>to set off a firestorm.</i>

40:35.875 --> 40:38.125
<i>Once the fire starts to spread,</i>

40:39.625 --> 40:41.458
<i>there's no controlling it.</i>

40:46.625 --> 40:49.125
Bertl, where are you?

40:49.208 --> 40:51.083
Get down from there! Kosh!

40:51.166 --> 40:52.000
Careful!

40:54.875 --> 40:59.041
-Are you crazy? What are you doing?
-He'll suffocate in there.

40:59.125 --> 41:01.750
So? Do you want to suffocate with him?

41:01.833 --> 41:05.291
The gas needs to be let out first.
Hans, no! Hans!

41:06.166 --> 41:08.083
Hans!

41:11.791 --> 41:13.791
<i>And you don't have any idea yet…</i>

41:17.125 --> 41:19.666
<i>how much scorched earth</i>
<i>you'll leave behind.</i>

41:23.250 --> 41:24.083
Hans?

41:25.708 --> 41:26.833
Hans! Wait.

41:28.916 --> 41:29.791
Come here.

41:31.625 --> 41:32.791
Kosh, wake up!

41:34.083 --> 41:35.083
Thank God.

41:38.958 --> 41:40.416
I'm so pathetic.

41:41.541 --> 41:43.208
What are you talking about?

41:45.333 --> 41:46.791
I stole the watch.

44:12.333 --> 44:15.541
