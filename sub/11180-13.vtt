WEBVTT

00:01.449 --> 00:03.969
Well, we're movin' on up
Movin' on up

00:04.107 --> 00:07.179
To the East Side
Movin' on up

00:07.317 --> 00:11.632
To a deluxe apartment
in the sky

00:11.770 --> 00:14.566
Movin' on up
Movin' on up

00:14.704 --> 00:17.776
To the East Side
Movin' on up

00:17.914 --> 00:21.538
We've finally got
a piece of the pie

00:23.471 --> 00:25.887
Fish don't fry
in the kitchen

00:26.026 --> 00:28.407
Beans don't burn
on the grill

00:28.545 --> 00:31.203
Took a whole lot of tryin'

00:31.341 --> 00:33.895
Just to get up that hill

00:34.034 --> 00:36.381
Now we're up
in the big leagues

00:36.519 --> 00:39.315
Gettin' our turn at bat

00:39.453 --> 00:41.696
As long as we live,
it's you and me, baby

00:41.834 --> 00:43.353
There ain't nothin' wrong
with that

00:43.491 --> 00:46.184
We're movin' on up
Movin' on up

00:46.322 --> 00:48.979
To the East Side
Movin' on up

00:49.118 --> 00:52.742
To a deluxe apartment
in the sky

00:53.846 --> 00:56.608
Movin' on up
Movin' on up

00:56.746 --> 00:59.783
To the East Side
Movin' on up

00:59.921 --> 01:04.926
We've finally got
a piece of the pie

01:11.140 --> 01:12.624
Sure is a beautiful morning,
ain't it, baby?

01:12.762 --> 01:15.144
Mmm.
But it's cold
out there, though.

01:15.282 --> 01:17.387
Know how I can tell?
Mmm-hmm.

01:17.525 --> 01:19.769
Because all the pigeons
on the terrace
are wearing earmuffs.

01:27.225 --> 01:29.019
I got to
hand it to you, Weezy.

01:29.158 --> 01:31.919
You've burnt my bacon
just right today.

01:33.369 --> 01:35.095
Wonderful.

01:35.233 --> 01:36.579
You didn't hear
a word I said, did you?

01:37.062 --> 01:38.374
Huh?

01:38.512 --> 01:40.272
Oh, yes, I did.
More coffee, right?

01:40.410 --> 01:42.067
I ain't finished
that cup yet.

01:42.205 --> 01:43.827
Good.

01:43.965 --> 01:46.485
Would you get your head
out of that damn book?

01:46.623 --> 01:47.900
What the hell
is that anyway?

01:48.038 --> 01:50.972
It's a wonderful book.
I got it to improve my memory.

01:52.250 --> 01:54.286
Oh! George!

01:54.424 --> 01:58.290
Your cup was still full.
Why did you
ask for more coffee?

01:58.428 --> 02:01.466
You don't need a memory book.
You need a hearing aid.

02:02.536 --> 02:05.573
I'm sorry,
but this is fun, George.

02:05.711 --> 02:08.369
You use key words
to help you remember.

02:08.507 --> 02:11.614
For example, if you wanted
to remember the alphabet,

02:11.752 --> 02:15.514
you say, "Animals are
gathered in the barn,

02:15.652 --> 02:19.484
"where we see
a cow standing
next to a donkey..."

02:19.622 --> 02:21.693
Oh, Weezy, that's ridiculous.
I already know my alphabet.

02:21.831 --> 02:24.351
Besides, ain't no barns
in New York.

02:24.489 --> 02:26.007
Well, what's that
got to do with it?

02:26.146 --> 02:27.975
There aren't any donkeys
in New York either.

02:28.113 --> 02:29.770
Oh, no? One just
bought that book.

02:36.880 --> 02:40.539
I've already memorized
a lot of useful information.

02:41.195 --> 02:42.369
Like what?

02:42.507 --> 02:44.233
Like all
the state capitals.

02:44.371 --> 02:45.717
Hmm.

02:45.855 --> 02:48.306
Go ahead.
Ask me a state capital
from any state.

02:50.273 --> 02:51.412
North Dakota.

02:52.102 --> 02:53.311
Okay.

02:53.449 --> 02:56.383
All I got to do
is remember the key words.

02:56.521 --> 02:57.832
Mmm.

02:57.970 --> 03:01.181
North, day, coat.

03:01.319 --> 03:04.045
I picture a man on a stallion,

03:04.184 --> 03:07.463
riding north for a day,

03:07.601 --> 03:09.396
wearing a fancy coat.

03:10.983 --> 03:12.675
Weezy, that don't
make no sense.

03:12.813 --> 03:15.540
Yes, it does,
because the man
on the stallion

03:15.678 --> 03:17.818
is the famous
German military leader.

03:17.956 --> 03:21.062
You put that all together
and you've got
the state capital.

03:22.029 --> 03:23.962
Hitlerhorse?

03:26.413 --> 03:29.174
Of course not.
It's Bismarck.

03:29.312 --> 03:31.418
What difference does it make?
I ain't ever going there.

03:32.522 --> 03:34.800
But I am going to work.
See you later, Weez.

03:34.938 --> 03:37.217
Aren't you forgetting
something, George?

03:38.148 --> 03:39.943
No.

03:40.081 --> 03:42.118
See? I don't need nothing
to help me remember.

03:50.851 --> 03:52.922
Would you like
to borrow my memory book?

03:56.236 --> 03:57.409
I just did that to test you.

04:03.139 --> 04:04.451
Oh, good morning,
Mr. Jefferson, sir.

04:04.589 --> 04:06.038
I'm glad I caught you
at home.

04:06.176 --> 04:07.868
Ralph, look, I already got
my paper, thanks.

04:08.006 --> 04:10.388
Oh, this isn't your paper,
Mr. Jefferson. It's mine.

04:10.526 --> 04:14.184
Well, actually, it's
Mr. Hackenschmitt's paper,
19B.

04:14.323 --> 04:17.153
He dropped it
in the wastebasket
on his way out this morning.

04:17.291 --> 04:19.604
I always say,
"Waste not, want not."

04:20.812 --> 04:22.331
A little yogurt there.

04:22.469 --> 04:25.782
Our Mr. Hackenschmitt
loves his health food.

04:25.920 --> 04:27.508
Oh, look, Ralph,
if you don't mind,
I'm on my way to work.

04:27.646 --> 04:29.786
Oh, yes, sir, but I must
talk to you about a tip.

04:29.924 --> 04:32.341
A tip for what? You ain't
did nothing but made me late.

04:32.479 --> 04:34.964
Sir, it isn't a tip for me,
it's for you.

04:35.102 --> 04:36.621
Oh, you're going
to give me some money.

04:36.759 --> 04:38.381
In a manner
of speaking, yes, sir.

04:38.519 --> 04:42.040
You see, last night,
I stopped off
at Charlie's Bar

04:42.178 --> 04:43.800
and I overheard
a couple of gentlemen

04:43.938 --> 04:45.802
discussing
a hot stock tip.

04:45.940 --> 04:48.149
Stock? Uh-uh.
Look, anybody that
buys some stock

04:48.288 --> 04:49.530
just because of something
they overhear

04:49.668 --> 04:51.463
from somebody
they don't even know
is a sucker.

04:51.601 --> 04:52.809
I quite agree, sir.

04:52.947 --> 04:54.811
That's why I thought
you'd be interested in this.

04:56.468 --> 04:57.607
Say what?

04:57.745 --> 04:59.506
This, sir.

05:01.439 --> 05:04.856
H.L.W. Funding Corporation?
What's so special about that?

05:04.994 --> 05:08.584
Well, sir, I put two and two
together and made one.

05:08.722 --> 05:10.965
Huh. I got a tip
for you, Ralph.

05:11.103 --> 05:13.934
See a psychiatrist...
Or a math teacher.

05:14.072 --> 05:16.730
I mean one big man, sir.

05:17.765 --> 05:19.698
Somebody I'm close to
every day.

05:19.836 --> 05:23.530
As a matter of fact,
I walk his little dog,
Capital Gains, every morning.

05:25.463 --> 05:28.017
His initials are H.L...

05:28.155 --> 05:29.467
Whittendale!

05:29.605 --> 05:31.883
You are astute, sir.

05:32.021 --> 05:33.229
You put together
your two and two

05:33.367 --> 05:35.576
even quicker than
I put together my two and two.

05:35.714 --> 05:38.890
That's why
I'm on this side of the door
and you're on that side.

05:40.063 --> 05:43.170
There you go again, sir.
I sure wish I had your brains.

05:43.308 --> 05:45.172
Oh, they probably
wouldn't work in your head.

05:46.484 --> 05:48.071
It's the wrong color.

05:49.556 --> 05:51.903
Anyway, sir,
from what I heard,

05:52.041 --> 05:54.871
this stock,
which is now selling
at a dollar a share,

05:55.009 --> 05:57.943
will, inside of a month,
quadruple.

05:58.496 --> 06:00.360
Five times as much?

06:00.498 --> 06:02.431
I'm going to make a fortune.

06:02.569 --> 06:03.915
Thanks, Ralph.

06:04.053 --> 06:05.710
Ah, thank you, sir.

06:05.848 --> 06:07.608
You won't tell nobody else
about this, will you?

06:07.746 --> 06:11.267
Well, sir, sometimes I do
tend to gossip a little.

06:11.405 --> 06:13.545
But just to
a few old friends.

06:14.374 --> 06:16.479
My lips are sealed, sir.

06:16.617 --> 06:18.447
Thank you, Ralph.

06:18.585 --> 06:21.381
Well, now I've got to call
my stockbroker. Oh, boy!

06:21.519 --> 06:24.314
Money falling from everywhere
around the world.

06:24.453 --> 06:26.662
George, I thought
you had left.

06:27.904 --> 06:29.872
Mmm. I'm calling
my stockbroker.

06:30.010 --> 06:31.529
Damn it, the line's busy.

06:31.667 --> 06:33.738
I'll bet everybody
and his brother
trying to get in on it.

06:33.876 --> 06:37.293
George, you've got
that look in your eye again.

06:37.431 --> 06:39.744
Come on, Weezy,
we just finished
eating breakfast.

06:46.751 --> 06:49.961
I mean you are thinking
of taking another wild plunge

06:50.099 --> 06:51.963
in the stock market,
aren't you?

06:52.101 --> 06:54.483
This is a sure thing.

06:54.621 --> 06:57.624
That's what you said about
soybeans, and lost your shirt.

06:57.762 --> 06:59.867
Don't worry.
This is money in the bank.

07:00.005 --> 07:03.630
That's what you said about
soybeans, and lost your shirt.

07:03.768 --> 07:05.597
But look, Weezy,
this is different.

07:05.735 --> 07:07.530
See? Pacific Stock Exchange.

07:07.668 --> 07:09.394
H.L.W. Funding Corporation.
See?

07:09.670 --> 07:10.775
So?

07:10.913 --> 07:12.673
So what do the initials
H.L.W. stand for?

07:13.571 --> 07:15.435
"Husband Loses Wife"?

07:17.782 --> 07:20.854
Henry L. Whittendale,
the bank president.
It's his company.

07:20.992 --> 07:22.545
And see what
he's selling it for?
A dollar a share.

07:22.683 --> 07:24.133
That's a steal.

07:24.271 --> 07:25.617
Oh, it's still busy.

07:27.308 --> 07:29.345
I hope the smart money
don't start buying in.

07:29.483 --> 07:32.072
Well, the dumb money sure is.

07:33.694 --> 07:34.971
Oh, hello, Tom.

07:35.109 --> 07:37.353
Hi, Louise. I'm just returning
your hot-water bottle.

07:37.491 --> 07:39.942
Oh, thanks.
Is your electric blanket
working again?

07:40.080 --> 07:41.564
Oh, this wasn't for our bed.

07:41.702 --> 07:43.842
I wanted it for
the football game
we went to last night.

07:43.980 --> 07:45.637
Oh, was it a good game?

07:45.775 --> 07:47.708
I don't know.
We didn't stay.

07:47.846 --> 07:50.124
Why?
Willis, you gonna
hang around all day?

07:50.262 --> 07:53.921
Good morning, George.
Oh, the financial page.

07:54.059 --> 07:55.923
Taking another plunge
in the stock market?

07:56.061 --> 07:58.961
No, he's taking
another dive into the soup.

07:59.099 --> 08:02.343
I keep telling you, Weezy,
this is a sure thing.

08:02.482 --> 08:04.863
Look, any of
Whittendale's companies
is a good investment,

08:05.001 --> 08:06.244
especially for
a dollar a share.

08:06.382 --> 08:08.108
Look...
A dollar a share?

08:08.246 --> 08:09.972
Whittendale
is strictly blue-chip.

08:10.110 --> 08:13.044
What company
are you talking about?

08:13.182 --> 08:15.909
Company? I didn't hear me
talking about no company.

08:16.047 --> 08:17.980
Ah, come on, George,
you can tell me.

08:18.118 --> 08:20.707
Yeah, I can
tell you goodbye.

08:20.845 --> 08:23.503
Well, I'm probably better off
not knowing. Bye, Louise.

08:23.641 --> 08:27.058
Oh, Tom, wait a minute.
This isn't our
hot-water bottle.

08:27.196 --> 08:28.887
Oh, dear, you noticed.

08:29.025 --> 08:30.475
Ours was a red one.

08:30.613 --> 08:31.925
A thin red one.

08:32.304 --> 08:33.409
What?

08:33.547 --> 08:35.618
I used it for a seat warmer
at the game.

08:36.964 --> 08:40.174
Unfortunately, I picked a seat
with a large splinter on it.

08:40.312 --> 08:41.451
And that's why you...

08:41.590 --> 08:44.075
BOTH:
Didn't stay to see the game.

08:44.213 --> 08:46.180
I dripped all the way home.

08:50.253 --> 08:53.325
Still busy. Oh, I got
to get down to the store.

08:55.604 --> 08:57.088
Where have you been?

08:57.226 --> 09:00.125
Out jogging around the block.
I'm in training.

09:00.263 --> 09:03.370
Good. It's about time
you learned how to
move faster.

09:03.508 --> 09:05.165
Oh, it ain't for that.

09:05.303 --> 09:07.477
See, Mrs. Jefferson,
some of the ladies
in our church

09:07.616 --> 09:09.583
decided to take this class
in self-defense.

09:09.721 --> 09:11.965
Oh, good for you.
What do they teach you?

09:12.103 --> 09:15.382
Well, it's a kind of Judo.
And it's so polite.

09:15.520 --> 09:16.866
Polite?
Yeah.

09:17.004 --> 09:18.592
You face your opponent,

09:18.730 --> 09:20.732
smile at him real nice,

09:20.870 --> 09:22.320
bow to him,

09:22.458 --> 09:23.735
and then you kick him
below the belt.

09:23.873 --> 09:25.530
Ugh!

09:25.668 --> 09:27.463
What you learning that for?
You thinking
about getting married?

09:29.603 --> 09:31.605
I'm learning it because
most of the women I know

09:31.743 --> 09:33.573
is afraid to walk
the streets at night.

09:33.711 --> 09:35.367
So are most of the men.

09:35.505 --> 09:36.610
Look, you're
wasting your time.

09:36.748 --> 09:38.647
There ain't no woman
no match for no man.

09:38.785 --> 09:40.338
Ha! You wrong
about that, honey.

09:40.476 --> 09:41.891
Just come at me.

09:42.029 --> 09:43.444
This is the most
ridiculous thing...

09:43.583 --> 09:45.412
Ha! Ooh!

09:47.172 --> 09:49.381
What the hell
kind of fighting is that?

09:51.452 --> 09:54.110
Dirty. The same way
the muggers fight.

09:54.248 --> 09:55.836
Now get on your feet, turkey.

09:57.527 --> 09:59.046
Ow! Hey!

09:59.184 --> 10:00.841
And here's how we call
for the police.

10:03.499 --> 10:06.019
That's very good, Florence.

10:06.157 --> 10:07.607
Are you all right, George?

10:07.745 --> 10:08.884
Are you kidding?

10:09.022 --> 10:11.265
I've just been attacked
by the bionic maid.

10:14.096 --> 10:15.822
Hi-ya!

10:19.066 --> 10:21.103
Let me out of here.

10:21.241 --> 10:23.450
Hey, Weezy, send this special
delivery for me, will you?

10:23.588 --> 10:24.554
All right.

10:24.693 --> 10:26.073
And keep calling
that stockbroker.

10:26.211 --> 10:28.662
Tell him I want 5000 shares
of H.L.W. Funding Corporation.

10:28.800 --> 10:31.182
Five thousand?
George, that's a lot of...

10:31.320 --> 10:33.046
Weezy, what's on the back
of that envelope?

10:34.564 --> 10:36.601
"Make sure flap is sealed."

10:37.084 --> 10:38.741
Got the message?

10:43.677 --> 10:45.334
Weezy! Weezy!

10:45.472 --> 10:47.267
She's out shopping, pop.
What's up?

10:47.405 --> 10:48.993
What's up?
I'll tell you what's up.

10:49.131 --> 10:51.685
H.L.W. Funding,
that's what's up.

10:51.823 --> 10:54.136
So?
So it's up to
$5 a share.

10:54.274 --> 10:56.414
I bought 5000 shares
at a dollar.

10:56.552 --> 10:58.036
You mean you're 20,000 ahead?

10:58.174 --> 10:59.382
In just two days!

10:59.520 --> 11:01.937
This stock is gonna
keep going up and up and up!

11:02.075 --> 11:03.248
All right!

11:03.386 --> 11:04.974
I knew what
I was doing! Shoot.

11:05.112 --> 11:06.700
I know my stuff, man.

11:06.838 --> 11:09.116
LOUISE: Somebody
open the door for me!

11:12.533 --> 11:14.363
Hey, Lionel, help your mother
with this stuff.

11:15.329 --> 11:16.572
Put all the groceries
in the kitchen

11:16.710 --> 11:19.333
because we are going out
on the town to celebrate.

11:19.471 --> 11:20.990
Celebrate what?

11:21.128 --> 11:22.647
Your husband's intelligence.

11:22.785 --> 11:25.029
Oh, just a small
celebration.

11:27.169 --> 11:29.619
Good one, Weezy,
but the joke is on you.

11:29.758 --> 11:31.380
Remember that stock
I told you to order for me?

11:31.518 --> 11:33.762
Stock?
H.L.W. Funding Corporation.

11:34.383 --> 11:35.522
Oh, yes. What about it?

11:35.660 --> 11:37.835
We hit the jackpot.
It's up to $5 a share!

11:39.284 --> 11:41.390
Five dollars a share?
Are you sure?

11:41.528 --> 11:43.426
There it is.
Look, go get changed,

11:43.564 --> 11:45.877
because the
wolf of Wall Street
will be howling tonight.

11:46.015 --> 11:47.568
Hey!

11:48.777 --> 11:51.952
Five dollars a share?

11:52.090 --> 11:54.368
Hey, mom, you want me
to put the meat
in the freezer?

11:54.506 --> 11:57.164
Five dollars a share?

11:57.302 --> 12:00.064
Yeah. Pop sure made a killing.

12:00.202 --> 12:02.825
That's nothing to the killing
he's going to make

12:02.963 --> 12:05.794
when he finds out
I forgot to call the broker.

12:16.183 --> 12:19.048
How am I going to tell him?
What am I going to tell him?

12:19.186 --> 12:21.982
Mom, you forgot.
People do forget.

12:22.120 --> 12:24.191
Yes, but I'm not supposed to.

12:24.329 --> 12:25.952
Why not?

12:26.090 --> 12:28.368
Because I'd learned
that the animals
are gathered at the barn,

12:28.506 --> 12:31.302
where they see a cow
standing next to a donkey.

12:32.648 --> 12:34.857
Are you all right, mom?

12:34.995 --> 12:37.860
Of course I'm not.
I'm a nervous wreck.

12:37.998 --> 12:39.966
Your father
will never forgive me.

12:40.104 --> 12:41.933
But you didn't
do it on purpose.

12:42.071 --> 12:44.418
I know that,
but he'll think I did.

12:44.556 --> 12:46.731
I was against it
in the first place

12:46.869 --> 12:49.596
and he'll never believe
that I really forgot.

12:51.322 --> 12:52.772
Forgot what?

12:53.600 --> 12:55.533
Ah... Uh, ribs.

12:55.671 --> 12:58.225
I know how you love ribs
and I forgot to buy them.

12:58.363 --> 13:00.227
That ain't the only thing
you forgot, is it?

13:00.676 --> 13:02.264
It isn't?

13:02.402 --> 13:03.852
You forgot something
more important
than the ribs, didn't you?

13:04.784 --> 13:06.061
George, I want
you to know

13:06.199 --> 13:07.441
I didn't do it deliberately.

13:07.579 --> 13:09.133
You've got to
believe that!

13:09.271 --> 13:10.755
It's okay, Weez.

13:11.411 --> 13:13.068
It is?

13:13.206 --> 13:14.724
Yeah, because
with all this excitement,
I almost forgot myself.

13:16.450 --> 13:17.866
You almost forgot what?

13:18.004 --> 13:19.660
The same thing
you forgot.

13:19.799 --> 13:22.284
What do you think
I forgot?

13:22.422 --> 13:25.459
That we're going out
on the town tonight.
Ain't that right?

13:25.597 --> 13:28.117
Yes, that's it.

13:28.255 --> 13:30.464
Weezy, when I told you
to call that stockbroker

13:30.602 --> 13:32.156
and order
the 5000 shares,

13:32.294 --> 13:34.158
the look you had
on your face was...

13:34.296 --> 13:36.263
Just like the look on it now.

13:39.059 --> 13:41.372
Uh, George, I, um...

13:42.407 --> 13:43.892
I have to tell you something.

13:44.030 --> 13:46.273
Go ahead.

13:46.411 --> 13:47.930
Not now, George. Later.

13:48.068 --> 13:49.380
When?

13:49.518 --> 13:51.623
On our 50th
wedding anniversary.

13:52.314 --> 13:53.418
Weezy, you said
you had...

13:53.556 --> 13:55.386
Oh, stop
hounding me, George!

13:55.524 --> 13:57.526
Okay, okay.
Forget it, hmm.

13:57.664 --> 13:59.942
That's what I did.
Huh?

14:00.080 --> 14:01.702
Lionel, you tell him.
Uh-uh.

14:01.841 --> 14:04.878
No, children should be seen
and not heard.

14:05.016 --> 14:06.949
Look, Weez,
you got something
to tell me or not?

14:08.157 --> 14:10.021
Okay.

14:10.159 --> 14:11.712
It's...

14:11.851 --> 14:13.231
It's, uh...

14:13.369 --> 14:15.613
It's the doorbell!

14:15.751 --> 14:18.754
What's wrong with you?
I've got to get the door!

14:18.892 --> 14:20.687
What's wrong with your mother?
Nothing.

14:20.825 --> 14:22.413
And there's nothing wrong
with you either.

14:22.551 --> 14:24.760
I love you both.

14:24.898 --> 14:27.556
Oh, Tom!
Come in. Come in!

14:27.694 --> 14:29.523
Look who's here, Tom Willis.

14:29.661 --> 14:30.870
Sit down, Tom.

14:31.008 --> 14:33.182
George, maybe Tom
would like a drink.

14:33.320 --> 14:34.908
Oh, no, no.
No, thanks.

14:35.046 --> 14:37.324
Well, I'll have a double.

14:37.462 --> 14:39.395
A double what?
Whatever's the quickest.

14:42.433 --> 14:43.606
Can't you wait till we go out?

14:43.744 --> 14:46.126
Oh, you're going out?
I wish I'd known.

14:46.264 --> 14:47.334
I would have told
Mr. Whittendale

14:47.472 --> 14:48.577
to make it
some other night.

14:48.715 --> 14:50.303
Whittendale to make what
some other night?

14:50.441 --> 14:53.651
I got into a conversation
with him a little while ago
down in the garage.

14:53.789 --> 14:54.755
What's he doing
down there?

14:54.894 --> 14:56.343
Working on
his car engine.

14:56.481 --> 14:58.449
Hah. See that, Weezy?
That's how the rich
get richer.

14:58.587 --> 15:00.623
See, Whittendale don't spend
his money on no mechanic.

15:00.761 --> 15:02.763
No, no, no.
That's his hobby.

15:02.902 --> 15:06.250
He loves working
on his 1941 Packard.

15:06.388 --> 15:09.011
Why don't he just
get a new car?
He's got enough money.

15:09.149 --> 15:10.979
Well, actually...
Never mind that.

15:11.117 --> 15:12.842
What were you talking
to Whittendale about?

15:12.981 --> 15:15.500
How well you were doing
with that new company of his.

15:15.638 --> 15:16.846
What did he say?

15:16.985 --> 15:20.195
He said,
"What new company?"

15:20.333 --> 15:22.128
He's probably wondering how
I found out about it, huh?

15:23.957 --> 15:26.477
Maybe that's why
he wanted to stop by
and talk to you tonight.

15:26.615 --> 15:28.203
What? Whittendale's
coming to see me?

15:28.341 --> 15:30.377
Well, that's what he said,
but since you're going out...

15:30.515 --> 15:32.517
Who's going out?
Look, I wouldn't
leave this building now

15:32.655 --> 15:34.761
if King Kong was hanging
from the terrace.

15:35.900 --> 15:37.419
Huh!

15:37.557 --> 15:39.283
I've been trying
to meet that dude
since we moved in here!

15:39.421 --> 15:40.387
I better get dressed.

15:40.525 --> 15:41.768
You are dressed.

15:41.906 --> 15:44.184
Oh, yeah. Ah!

15:44.322 --> 15:45.358
Imagine that, Weezy.

15:45.496 --> 15:47.222
Whittendale's coming
to see me.

15:47.360 --> 15:48.602
We're on our way, Weez,

15:48.740 --> 15:50.225
and who knows
where we'll end up.

15:51.122 --> 15:53.711
If I'm lucky, just divorced.

15:54.988 --> 15:56.817
Well, I guess
I'd better be going.

15:56.956 --> 15:58.750
Good idea.

16:00.614 --> 16:02.306
What?
Oh, thanks.

16:02.444 --> 16:03.652
You done me
a good favor.

16:03.790 --> 16:04.825
It was nothing.

16:04.964 --> 16:06.931
I know. I'm just
trying to be polite.

16:08.312 --> 16:10.762
Oh. Oh, oh!

16:10.900 --> 16:13.938
You really scared me
half to death.
How?

16:14.076 --> 16:16.147
You almost
said something nice.

16:18.529 --> 16:19.840
Well, come on, Weezy!
Don't just sit there!

16:19.979 --> 16:21.290
Get this place
cleaned up.

16:21.428 --> 16:23.396
Lionel! Get out here.

16:23.534 --> 16:26.192
Where's the fire?
Under your feet.

16:26.330 --> 16:29.195
Run down to the store
and get those magazines
that nobody ever reads.

16:29.333 --> 16:30.334
Huh?

16:30.472 --> 16:32.025
The kind they have
in dentists' offices.

16:32.163 --> 16:34.545
Oh, you mean like
U.S. Finance
and Consumer Reports?

16:34.683 --> 16:36.581
Right. I got to make
an impression on Whittendale.

16:36.719 --> 16:38.342
It's important
what he thinks.

16:38.480 --> 16:40.447
Pop, he's gonna think
you steal your magazines
from your dentist.

16:40.585 --> 16:42.829
Just get going.
Pick me up a copy
of my Wall Street Journal.

16:42.967 --> 16:44.348
Okay.
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

16:44.486 --> 16:46.246
Wow, it's been
a heck of a day, Weez.

16:46.384 --> 16:47.454
Whittendale's
coming to see me.

16:47.592 --> 16:49.180
I just made me
20,000 bucks.

16:49.318 --> 16:52.459
Money isn't everything,
George.

16:52.597 --> 16:55.186
Yeah, you're right, Weezy.
Money isn't being poor.

16:55.324 --> 16:57.050
Money isn't being hungry.

16:57.188 --> 16:58.879
Money isn't being cold.

16:59.018 --> 17:00.985
Everything that money isn't,
I'm glad we ain't got.

17:03.091 --> 17:06.473
Uh, George, I hate
to spoil your evening,

17:06.611 --> 17:08.406
but I've got to be
honest with you.

17:09.787 --> 17:11.168
What's that supposed
to mean?

17:11.306 --> 17:14.757
It means I have to tell you
the truth about something,

17:14.895 --> 17:16.932
and you're not
going to like it.

17:17.070 --> 17:19.866
Weezy, don't tell me
you've been messing around
behind my back.

17:22.765 --> 17:25.285
You know I wouldn't
do anything like that.

17:25.423 --> 17:27.770
Oh. Well, if it ain't that,
it can't be that bad.
Ha-ha-ha!

17:28.564 --> 17:29.979
You sure
you won't get mad?

17:30.118 --> 17:33.259
How could I get mad at
a wonderful woman like you?

17:33.397 --> 17:36.262
Oh, okay, George.

17:36.400 --> 17:38.954
I forgot to call the broker
and order your stock.

17:39.092 --> 17:40.956
You forgot?

17:41.094 --> 17:43.614
She f...
She forgot!

17:44.546 --> 17:46.720
Of all the dumb,
stupid...

17:46.858 --> 17:48.446
Wonderful?

17:48.584 --> 17:49.896
Look, how could you
remember something
as hard as

17:50.034 --> 17:51.346
Hitlerhorse,
North Dakota,

17:51.484 --> 17:54.556
and forget something as simple
as making a phone call?

17:57.731 --> 17:59.733
I didn't forget
the phone call.

17:59.871 --> 18:03.289
The keywords were Kojak,
bogus and Culligan Man.

18:03.427 --> 18:05.532
What the hell
is that supposed to mean?

18:06.499 --> 18:09.122
You see, "Kojak" means
Telly Savalas.

18:09.260 --> 18:10.986
"Bogus" is phony,

18:11.124 --> 18:13.471
and "Culligan Man"
is something you call.

18:13.609 --> 18:15.128
"Telly," "phony," "call."

18:15.266 --> 18:16.819
Tellyphony call.
Get it?

18:16.957 --> 18:19.201
Yeah, I got it,
but evidently, you didn't!

18:20.478 --> 18:22.031
How come you didn't
make the phone call?

18:22.894 --> 18:24.896
Because I forgot
who I was calling.

18:25.034 --> 18:26.450
Oh, no!

18:27.830 --> 18:29.936
What the hell is that?
Well, how should I know?

18:31.731 --> 18:33.871
But whatever it is,
it's getting closer.

18:34.009 --> 18:35.735
Open the door!

18:35.873 --> 18:37.150
Oh, it's that dumb Florence.

18:37.288 --> 18:38.979
Call the police.
Quick!

18:39.118 --> 18:40.429
Don't let him get away!

18:43.467 --> 18:44.433
Police!

18:45.917 --> 18:48.161
Stop blowing that damn thing!
What's happening?

18:48.299 --> 18:49.852
A mugger tried to
attack me in the elevator.

18:49.990 --> 18:52.200
What?
Oh, my God.
Are you all right?

18:52.338 --> 18:53.511
Yeah, thanks
to my Judo.

18:53.649 --> 18:54.961
I'll get him.

18:56.135 --> 18:58.930
Wait, hold it. I ain't
got no Judo training.

19:02.831 --> 19:05.074
The elevator door just shut.
He's on the way to the lobby.

19:05.213 --> 19:06.835
Call and tell Ralph
to grab him.

19:06.973 --> 19:08.906
Ralph?
He'll do anything for a tip.

19:09.044 --> 19:10.459
Yeah, you're right.

19:10.597 --> 19:13.082
You'd better sit down.
You must be
quite shaken up.

19:13.221 --> 19:15.464
No, I'm fine.
I was the winner.

19:16.914 --> 19:18.467
Hello, Ralph?
George Jefferson.

19:18.605 --> 19:21.505
Look, a man just tried to mug
Florence on the elevator.

19:21.643 --> 19:24.232
The elevator's on its way to
the lobby. Grab him! Grab him!

19:25.371 --> 19:27.304
Florence, tell us
what happened.

19:27.442 --> 19:30.514
Well, one of the main
things they taught us
in our self-defense class

19:30.652 --> 19:34.380
was to watch out
for strange men in elevators.

19:34.518 --> 19:36.175
Of course, that don't mean
you don't have to be careful

19:36.313 --> 19:37.935
in the streets
and in subways...

19:38.073 --> 19:41.145
The elevator, Florence.
What happened
in the elevator?

19:41.283 --> 19:44.044
Oh, well, see,
I got on the elevator

19:44.183 --> 19:46.081
and I pushed a button
to go up,

19:46.219 --> 19:49.809
but instead of going up,
it went down, to the basement.

19:49.947 --> 19:51.397
And then this man got on,

19:51.535 --> 19:53.295
and he was wearing
this dirty old jacket

19:53.433 --> 19:55.263
and these dirty old pants.

19:55.401 --> 19:58.990
And he looked at me
with his dirty old beady eyes.

19:59.991 --> 20:01.579
Go on. Go on!

20:01.717 --> 20:03.719
I knew right away he didn't
belong in this building.

20:03.857 --> 20:07.344
And that's when you hit him?
No, because
I still wasn't sure.

20:07.482 --> 20:10.209
I just kind of stared
at him like this.

20:15.455 --> 20:17.043
Did that
make him nervous?

20:17.181 --> 20:20.115
It sure did,
because then he said,
"My, isn't it warm in here?"

20:20.253 --> 20:21.910
And he took off his jacket.

20:22.048 --> 20:23.739
And a big wrench
fell out right on the floor.

20:23.877 --> 20:25.603
That's when you
let him have it?
No.

20:25.741 --> 20:27.260
That's when he
picked up the wrench.

20:27.398 --> 20:29.124
And that's when you
let him have it?
No.

20:29.262 --> 20:31.816
Will you shut up
and let her tell the story?

20:32.714 --> 20:33.887
Go on, Florence.

20:34.025 --> 20:35.751
Well, I still wasn't sure,

20:35.889 --> 20:39.824
but when the elevator stopped
at this floor and I got off,

20:39.962 --> 20:42.102
he got off
and started to follow me.

20:42.241 --> 20:43.828
Mmm. Well?

20:43.966 --> 20:46.106
Well, ain't you going
to say it?
Say what?

20:46.245 --> 20:47.487
"That's when you
let him have it"?

20:47.625 --> 20:49.662
'Cause that's when
I let him have it.

20:51.629 --> 20:54.425
Oh, Florence, what
a terrible experience.

20:54.563 --> 20:55.875
Florence,
you did great.

20:57.463 --> 20:59.050
That turkey's lucky he wasn't
there when I ran out.

20:59.188 --> 21:01.018
I'd have tied fire
to his tail. Hello?

21:01.156 --> 21:02.537
Ralph! Did you get him?

21:02.675 --> 21:04.642
Good. Huh?

21:05.022 --> 21:06.851
Say what?

21:07.335 --> 21:08.888
You're kidding.

21:09.026 --> 21:11.200
Look, Ralph, forget I called.

21:11.339 --> 21:13.513
There's 20 bucks in it
for you.

21:13.858 --> 21:15.274
Okay? Good.

21:18.035 --> 21:19.312
You know who that man was
on the elevator?

21:19.795 --> 21:21.728
Jack the Ripper.

21:21.866 --> 21:25.214
No, you dummy. You just
Judoed H.L. Whittendale.

21:25.353 --> 21:27.424
Whittendale? He lives
in the penthouse.

21:27.562 --> 21:29.046
That turkey followed me
out on this floor.

21:29.184 --> 21:30.496
Because he was
coming to see me!

21:30.634 --> 21:32.705
Oh, my goodness gracious!
Lord, have mercy!

21:32.843 --> 21:34.327
You mean I hit
an innocent man?

21:34.465 --> 21:36.053
I'll never forgive myself.

21:36.191 --> 21:38.020
Good, because
that makes two of us.

21:39.090 --> 21:40.437
George, don't yell
at Florence.

21:40.575 --> 21:41.852
She didn't know
who he was.

21:41.990 --> 21:43.474
Well, I hope he
didn't know who she was.

21:43.612 --> 21:45.511
Only way I'll get to
see him now is in court.

21:47.098 --> 21:48.341
Hey, did you hear
what just happened?

21:48.479 --> 21:50.412
Mr. Whittendale was just
attacked in the elevator.

21:50.550 --> 21:52.759
No? Mr. Whittendale?

21:52.897 --> 21:54.968
Who would do
a thing like that?

21:57.281 --> 21:58.834
How is he?

21:58.972 --> 22:01.078
Oh, he's all right now.
Just a little shaken up,
that's all.

22:01.216 --> 22:03.736
Thank you,
heavenly Father.

22:05.013 --> 22:06.601
Did he see
who hit him?
Oh, yeah.

22:06.739 --> 22:08.223
Oh, no.

22:08.361 --> 22:11.053
He said the man was disguised
as a middle-aged lady.

22:18.164 --> 22:20.649
Who's middle-aged?

22:20.787 --> 22:22.824
Look, stay out of this,
Florence.
This don't concern you.

22:22.962 --> 22:25.654
Just get back
in the kitchen and attack
those pots and pans.

22:27.242 --> 22:29.486
Middle-aged? Hmm!
Who's he calling
middle-aged?

22:29.624 --> 22:31.488
He's old as Methuselah!

22:32.661 --> 22:34.076
Well, wait till you
hear the story

22:34.214 --> 22:35.906
about the stock
that pop invested in.

22:36.044 --> 22:37.632
I don't want to hear
any more about it.

22:37.770 --> 22:39.012
Look what they're
calling it, pop.

22:39.150 --> 22:40.393
"The sensation
of Wall Street."

22:40.531 --> 22:41.498
Did you hear that, Weezy?

22:41.636 --> 22:43.223
I said I don't
want to hear it.

22:43.362 --> 22:45.260
Brokers say they've never seen
anything like it.

22:45.398 --> 22:48.194
Did you hear that?
Lionel, why are you
rubbing it in?

22:48.332 --> 22:53.061
"H.L.W.,
the Horace Logan Wayburn
Funding Corporation..."

22:53.199 --> 22:54.373
Wayburn?

22:54.511 --> 22:57.065
"...is the biggest fraud
since gold bricks."

22:57.203 --> 22:58.377
What!

22:58.515 --> 23:00.862
I can't hear you.
I can't hear you.

23:01.794 --> 23:03.658
It's all a scam.
A rip-off.

23:03.796 --> 23:05.625
You know, you're lucky mom
didn't make that phone call.

23:05.763 --> 23:07.765
Yeah.
She saved you
5000 bucks.

23:07.903 --> 23:09.940
Hey! Hey, Weezy...

23:10.078 --> 23:11.251
I don't want
to hear it.

23:11.390 --> 23:13.771
No, no, no. It's all right,
Weezy. I love you!

23:13.909 --> 23:16.912
You do?
That's right.
I love you.

23:17.050 --> 23:19.950
Oh, George.
You're so good to me.

23:23.125 --> 23:25.542
How can you be so forgiving?

23:26.681 --> 23:28.993
That's the kind
of man I am.

23:31.548 --> 23:33.550
Ha, ha, ha! Ooh!

24:03.718 --> 24:08.136
LOUISE: The Jeffersons was
recorded on tape in front of
a studio audience.
