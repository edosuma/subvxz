IF HE DOES FRANCHISE THE DINER,

41:53.011 --> 41:55.805
GET HIM TO PUT ONE NEAR YALE.

41:55.847 --> 41:57.890
I MISS THOSE BURGERS.

41:55.847 --> 41:57.890
HE'S NOT FRANCHISING.

41:57.932 --> 41:59.767
HEY, CAN I ASK YOU

41:57.932 --> 41:59.767
A QUESTION?

41:57.932 --> 41:59.767
Sure.

41:59.809 --> 42:01.227
DO YOU THINK

41:59.809 --> 42:01.227
I'M TOO SCARED?

42:01.269 --> 42:03.480
What?

42:01.269 --> 42:03.480
TOO SCARED, TOO TIMID.

42:03.521 --> 42:05.273
DO I TAKE ENOUGH CHANCES?

42:05.315 --> 42:06.483
WHAT KIND OF CHANCES?

42:06.565 --> 42:07.942
I DON'T KNOW --

42:06.565 --> 42:07.942
LIFE CHANCES.

42:07.984 --> 42:09.777
I THINK YOU DO.

42:07.984 --> 42:09.777
I'M NOT A MOUSE?

42:09.819 --> 42:11.446
WHERE IS THIS COMING FROM?

42:09.819 --> 42:11.446
I DON'T KNOW.

42:11.488 --> 42:13.281
JUST SOMETHING I'VE BEEN

42:11.488 --> 42:13.281
THINKING ABOUT LATELY.

42:13.323 --> 42:14.949
[ KNOCK ON DOOR ]

42:14.991 --> 42:17.118
SOMEONE'S AT THE DOOR.

42:14.991 --> 42:17.118
UM, SAY HI TO LUKE FOR ME.

42:17.160 --> 42:18.828
If he's not comatose.

42:17.160 --> 42:18.828
Bye, hon.

42:18.870 --> 42:19.787
BYE.
