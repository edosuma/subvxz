00:04.080 --> 00:05.490
[Ryn]
Previously on Siren.

00:05.500 --> 00:06.910
It's Mom.

00:06.920 --> 00:08.114
She in the emergency room.

00:08.120 --> 00:11.908
[moaning]

00:11.920 --> 00:14.036
Ryn help Ben's mother.

00:14.040 --> 00:18.158
Stem cells_ from
a deepwater marlne creature.

00:18.170 --> 00:22.038
[laughs] Imagine what
your father's going to say.

00:22.040 --> 00:23.951
[Helen]
That's my mother.

00:23.960 --> 00:26.997
Yes. A long time ago,
she was part of the group.

00:27.000 --> 00:29.912
What happened
to your folks wasn't right.

00:29.920 --> 00:31.660
I'll never forget it.

00:31.670 --> 00:33.877
[Xander] Was sleeping
with me part of the job?

00:33.880 --> 00:35.871
I'm here
because I care about you.

00:35.880 --> 00:37.495
Oh. Then you look me
in the eye

00:37.500 --> 00:39.991
and you tell me
that you're here
just to check on me.

00:40.000 --> 00:41.911
You're not just
a little bit curious
about where they went?

00:43.880 --> 00:45.199
[banging]

00:45.210 --> 00:46.199
-[Ben] Ryn!
-Raah!

00:46.210 --> 00:47.108
Ryn!

00:47.120 --> 00:49.111
Aaaah!

00:50.790 --> 00:51.916
[Ben] Ryn!

00:51.920 --> 00:53.114
[Maddie] Ryn!

00:58.710 --> 01:00.780
[panﬁng]

01:06.460 --> 01:07.609
Ryn!

01:11.080 --> 01:12.069
[Maddie] Ryn!

01:13.080 --> 01:14.286
Ryn!

01:18.250 --> 01:23.074
[ominous music playing]

01:34.420 --> 01:37.036
[high-pitched call]

01:39.620 --> 01:41.247
Ryn!

01:41.250 --> 01:43.206
Ryn, where are you?!

01:43.210 --> 01:44.245
Wait. Wait, wait, wait.

01:48.880 --> 01:51.075
[flapping]

01:51.080 --> 01:52.240
She could be anywhere.

01:52.250 --> 01:54.457
We can't stop, Maddie.

01:56.420 --> 01:58.115
How are we going
to find her?

01:59.210 --> 02:00.245
We need help.

02:00.250 --> 02:01.820
From who?

02:03.670 --> 02:05.160
Nicole.

02:05.170 --> 02:06.569
You really think
we can trust her?

02:06.580 --> 02:08.116
We don't have a choice,
Maddie.

02:09.540 --> 02:11.326
She's out here,
and she's dangerous,

02:11.330 --> 02:12.957
and we need
to find her now.

02:18.580 --> 02:21.208
You got
everything you wanted.

02:21.210 --> 02:23.997
Two of my best friends
eating out the palm
of your hands.

02:25.170 --> 02:28.287
Willing test subject for,
I don't know,

02:28.290 --> 02:30.372
whatever the hell
your people are doing.

02:30.380 --> 02:32.280
That's not everything
I wanted.

02:35.380 --> 02:37.371
Look, I don't expect you
to forgive me.

02:37.380 --> 02:39.029
I mean, how could you?

02:39.040 --> 02:40.530
You don't even know me.

02:40.540 --> 02:43.998
Look, I gotta get this place
ready for business, so...

02:48.380 --> 02:50.371
My older brother
was deployed two years ago.

02:51.830 --> 02:52.819
Iraq.

02:54.250 --> 02:55.740
I enlisted
right after him.

02:59.170 --> 03:00.535
Grew up in a military family,

03:00.540 --> 03:02.076
so it was
kind of the thing to do.

03:03.420 --> 03:05.285
Yeah, family business,
I get it.

03:07.460 --> 03:10.247
First week there,
his convoy was hit by an IED.

03:13.120 --> 03:14.326
He survived,

03:14.330 --> 03:15.536
but with lots of damage.

03:19.330 --> 03:20.376
Wow.

03:21.460 --> 03:23.200
I'm sorry.

03:23.210 --> 03:26.873
I didn't see any action,
but I had to do something.

03:26.880 --> 03:28.916
I heard about
this military program.

03:28.920 --> 03:31.662
Supposed to help
wounded soldiers walk again.

03:31.670 --> 03:35.379
They said it involved the use
of "exotic" stem cells.

03:35.380 --> 03:37.200
Yeah, that must
have been a weird day

03:37.210 --> 03:39.667
when you found out
what that meant.

03:39.670 --> 03:41.740
I volunteered to help
in any way that I could.

03:42.790 --> 03:43.950
I was low level at ﬁrst,

03:43.960 --> 03:45.450
until the program's leader--

03:45.460 --> 03:48.952
guy named Aldon Decker--
killed himself.

03:50.210 --> 03:51.199
Yeah, I met him.

03:53.040 --> 03:56.203
Military asked me
to go undercover
in Bristol Cove.

03:57.380 --> 04:00.452
IfI could help figure
out why Decker died,

04:00.460 --> 04:01.916
they'd be able
to continue his work.

04:03.750 --> 04:06.207
I never wanted to hurt anyone.

04:06.210 --> 04:08.576
[cell phone buzzing]

04:10.620 --> 04:12.281
Well, duty calls, I guess.

04:13.290 --> 04:15.246
[buzzing]

04:16.710 --> 04:18.029
[beeps]

04:18.040 --> 04:19.075
Hey.

04:20.920 --> 04:22.239
[Ben]
We did this to her.

04:22.250 --> 04:24.115
The stem cell extraction,

04:24.120 --> 04:26.497
it caused Ryn to have
some kind of reaction.

04:26.500 --> 04:28.286
Her cortisol levels spiked.

04:28.290 --> 04:30.246
Maybe some kind
of defensive response.

04:30.250 --> 04:31.786
Back someone in a corner,
they're gonna react.

04:31.790 --> 04:33.075
You should've
told me sooner.

04:33.080 --> 04:34.616
We thought
we had it under control.

04:34.620 --> 04:36.531
Clearly, you didn't.

04:36.540 --> 04:38.076
I have to alert my CD.

04:38.080 --> 04:39.536
You should think about that.

04:39.540 --> 04:40.825
What's to think about?

04:40.830 --> 04:42.741
She's dangerous
and on the loose.

04:42.750 --> 04:44.035
She ran into the woods.

04:44.040 --> 04:46.201
We can all find her
and bring her back.

04:46.210 --> 04:48.280
And do it without all of us,
including you,

04:48.290 --> 04:49.700
having to get burned.

04:50.750 --> 04:52.115
How do you think
your superiors

04:52.120 --> 04:54.452
are gonna react to you
letting this get out of hand?

04:54.460 --> 04:57.452
My only mistake was putting
Ryn back in your care.

04:57.460 --> 04:58.700
It doesn't matter
whose fault it is.

04:58.710 --> 05:00.200
We need to find Ryn.

05:00.210 --> 05:01.666
It's why we called you.

05:05.750 --> 05:06.819
Got the satellite link,

05:06.830 --> 05:08.741
just have to set
the target area.

05:08.750 --> 05:11.492
You're not gonna, like,
nuke Bri_stol Cove
from orbit are you?

05:11.500 --> 05:13.161
It's thermal imaging.

05:13.170 --> 05:16.242
Should help us pinpoint
exactly where Ryn is.

05:16.250 --> 05:18.741
Yeah, but how do you know
it's her and not
some rando campers?

05:18.750 --> 05:20.615
Ryn's core body temp
is different than ours.

05:20.620 --> 05:21.826
Ninety-two degrees.

05:24.830 --> 05:27.879
[beeping]

05:27.880 --> 05:29.575
If that's her,
she's moving fast.

05:34.000 --> 05:35.570
[panﬁng]

05:35.580 --> 05:37.821
Ryn!

05:37.830 --> 05:39.206
[Maddie]
Where are you?!

05:39.210 --> 05:41.826
Well, so much
for a quiet morning.

05:41.830 --> 05:43.161
[hisses]

05:43.170 --> 05:45.741

05:45.750 --> 05:47.536

-[hisses]

05:51.830 --> 05:53.115
[soft hiss]

05:53.120 --> 05:54.109
[gunshot]

06:03.500 --> 06:04.910
Dad, it's a person.

06:06.500 --> 06:07.785
Rifle down, now.

06:09.790 --> 06:11.030
Are you okay?!

06:11.040 --> 06:13.497
You could get yourself
killed out here!

06:15.960 --> 06:17.916
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Easy, easy.

06:17.920 --> 06:20.036
Careful, buddy.
There's a girl out here.

06:20.040 --> 06:21.496
I don't know
what she's on,

06:21.500 --> 06:22.569
but she's gonna
get herself hurt.

06:22.580 --> 06:23.877
Did you see
where she went?

06:25.330 --> 06:27.912
If you're smart,
you'll get out of here.

06:27.920 --> 06:30.707
[intense music playing]

06:37.920 --> 06:39.956
What the hell, man!

06:39.960 --> 06:40.995
Where is she?!

06:41.000 --> 06:42.206
She didn't come this way.

06:43.710 --> 06:44.825
Maddie.

06:45.880 --> 06:47.416
-Come on.
-Come on.

07:01.790 --> 07:03.326
[hisses]

07:03.330 --> 07:04.456
Ryn.

07:04.460 --> 07:05.996
[hisses]

07:06.000 --> 07:06.819
Ryn, it's Maddie.

07:09.040 --> 07:10.996
Do you understand
what's happening?

07:11.000 --> 07:11.785
[hisses]

07:11.790 --> 07:12.779
Ryn!

07:15.790 --> 07:16.779
Ryn, please.

07:19.920 --> 07:21.319
Please.

07:24.120 --> 07:29.035
[singing ethereal Siren song]

07:41.120 --> 07:44.032
[song intensifies]

07:44.040 --> 07:46.201
No, no, no, no, no!

07:46.210 --> 07:47.666
Maddie, Maddie, Maddie!
No,no,no!

07:47.670 --> 07:48.876
[song stops abruptly]

07:48.880 --> 07:50.825
No, no, no, no!

07:50.830 --> 07:52.912
Look at me.
You okay?

07:58.920 --> 07:59.955
Ryn?

08:01.290 --> 08:02.871
Can you hear me?

08:02.880 --> 08:04.199
Ben?

08:06.040 --> 08:07.246
What did I do?

08:20.040 --> 08:22.201
[sweeping]

08:29.750 --> 08:31.115
[Ben] You're sure
you're all right?

08:31.120 --> 08:36.069
I mean, no accelerated
heart rate? Anxiety?

08:36.080 --> 08:38.992
I mean, a little shalq,
but other than that,
I feel fine.

08:41.250 --> 08:43.491
You don't remember
anything, Ryn?

08:43.500 --> 08:46.913
I remember,
but could not stop.

08:46.920 --> 08:49.070
It's okay.
It's not your fault.

08:49.080 --> 08:52.413
Not okay.
This is not Ryn.

08:53.790 --> 08:55.030
Something change me.

08:56.380 --> 09:00.077
Know I do bad thing,
but do it anyway.

09:00.080 --> 09:02.036
How do you feel now?

09:02.040 --> 09:03.200
Okay, now.

09:03.210 --> 09:05.531
When I sing,
I feel better.

09:05.540 --> 09:09.374
Ryn told us before
that the song does
something for her, too.

09:09.380 --> 09:10.870
Whatever it releases,

09:10.880 --> 09:12.700
_ it seems like
It's strong enough

09:12.710 --> 09:15.952
to reduce the built-up
adrenaline at a rapid rate.

09:15.960 --> 09:19.532
Might be a good idea
to keep the needles
away from her for a while.

09:19.540 --> 09:20.780
[Ben] Yeah, right.

09:20.790 --> 09:22.917
But what about you, Maddie?

09:24.120 --> 09:25.997
What do you mean?

09:26.000 --> 09:27.160
I don't know.
How about the fact

09:27.170 --> 09:28.706
that Ryn just did
her thing to you?

09:28.710 --> 09:30.109
You're acting
like it's nothing.

09:30.120 --> 09:31.997
Hey, we're working
through it, Xan.

09:32.000 --> 09:33.740
Says the guy who's had
this song stuck in his head

09:33.750 --> 09:35.160
for, what,
the last couple months?

09:36.330 --> 09:38.958
Look, can we just--

09:38.960 --> 09:42.282
just fact check, yeah,
for, like, a second?

09:42.290 --> 09:45.953
So the three of you are
working with the military

09:45.960 --> 09:48.576
to get some genetic goo
out of Ryn

09:48.580 --> 09:50.161
and inject it
into Ben's mom,

09:50.170 --> 09:54.709
and because of all this,
Ryn just went "beast mode."

09:56.040 --> 09:57.780
[laughs]
I mean, I'm sorry,

09:57.790 --> 09:59.166
but y'all need to get
your damn heads checked!

10:03.290 --> 10:05.030
That's just
one guy's opinion, so...

10:08.040 --> 10:09.029
He's not wrong.

10:10.330 --> 10:12.070
About checking our heads.

10:14.080 --> 10:15.991
Maybe it's time
we considered it.

10:18.170 --> 10:20.741
Decker's brain scans,
the ones you showed me.

10:21.880 --> 10:23.745
Can we do the same for us?

10:23.750 --> 10:25.570
Yeah. Just gotta get you
back to the lab.

10:25.580 --> 10:27.741
If we know exactly
how the song's
affecting us--

10:27.750 --> 10:29.320
Maybe we can do
something about it.

10:42.750 --> 10:44.741
You should've
discussed it with me.

10:44.750 --> 10:47.241
Instead you go injecting
yourself with another
experimental treatment.

10:47.250 --> 10:48.786
I mean, I know you
want to get better, but--

10:48.790 --> 10:51.076
I think
it did make me better.

10:51.080 --> 10:52.069
Those awful side effects

10:52.080 --> 10:54.036
from the previous treatment
are gone.

10:54.040 --> 10:56.201
Even the nerve pain
that I used to have
is a little better.

10:56.210 --> 10:59.418
I'm not going to be running
marathons anytime soon,
but it's a start.

10:59.420 --> 11:00.660
You should've at least
stayed In the hospital

11:00.670 --> 11:02.240
so they could monitor you.

11:02.250 --> 11:05.117
You know the chances
of infection are higher there.

11:05.120 --> 11:07.953
They said that I could
recuperate at home.

11:07.960 --> 11:11.111
Ijust... It got
really, really close there

11:11.120 --> 11:12.872
in the hospital
for a few minutes.

11:14.120 --> 11:16.918
Ithought
was gonna lose you.

11:16.920 --> 11:18.740
But things
are finally turning around.

11:20.170 --> 11:21.535
And we have our son
to thank for that.

11:21.540 --> 11:23.201
What do you mean?

11:23.210 --> 11:25.075
Ben is the one who found
the new treatment.

11:25.080 --> 11:28.709
He even had a specialized
military doctor
to administer it.

11:28.710 --> 11:30.280
These guys are
the best of the best.

11:30.290 --> 11:32.281
So you've both been
keeping this from me.

11:32.290 --> 11:34.326
Don't blame him.

11:34.330 --> 11:36.821
His intention was to help me,
not to deceive you.

11:36.830 --> 11:38.377
With everything
that's been going on.

11:41.170 --> 11:44.207
Now is the perfect time
to put it to rest.

11:44.210 --> 11:45.700
[dialing]

11:47.420 --> 11:49.115
-[line ringing]
-[frustrated sigh]

11:49.120 --> 11:53.705
Are you sure you're up
for entertaining right now, Mom?

11:53.710 --> 11:55.996
Every day feels better
than the last.

11:56.000 --> 11:57.319
I'll see what we can do,

11:57.330 --> 11:58.911
but the timing right now is--

11:58.920 --> 12:00.569
[Elaine]
Everything, Ben.

12:00.580 --> 12:02.536
If I've learned anything,

12:02.540 --> 12:05.703
it's that time is not something
I can take for granted anymore.

12:05.710 --> 12:08.076
All of us could use
a fresh start.

12:08.080 --> 12:09.160
That's easier said
than done.

12:09.170 --> 12:10.205
Nonsense.

12:10.210 --> 12:12.280
Tomorrow night, 7 PM.

12:12.290 --> 12:13.700
Nothing fancy.

12:13.710 --> 12:16.247
You can come
with Maddie, and

12:16.250 --> 12:18.491
I want you to bring
that girl from the hospital,

12:18.500 --> 12:21.162
the one who helped me.
I need to thank her.

12:21.170 --> 12:22.614
Mom, uh...

12:22.620 --> 12:25.168
Ben. Please.

12:28.210 --> 12:29.279
Okay.

12:31.830 --> 12:33.115
[beeps]

12:35.120 --> 12:37.668
[MRI machine humming]

12:43.250 --> 12:44.285
[humming stops]

12:46.420 --> 12:49.321
[table clicks and whirs]

12:53.500 --> 12:54.990
You okay?

12:55.000 --> 12:56.376
Yeah, fine.

12:56.380 --> 12:58.075
How's your mom?

12:58.080 --> 13:02.369
Uh, she wants us to go
to dinner tomorrow night.

13:02.380 --> 13:04.200
She wants me
to bring Ryn, too.

13:05.670 --> 13:07.376
Ben's mother is better?

13:07.380 --> 13:09.666
Must be, if she's feeling
good enough to see people.

13:09.670 --> 13:12.377
Look, Ryn and I have to go,

13:12.380 --> 13:13.369
but if you don't
feel up to it--

13:13.380 --> 13:14.369
It's fine.

13:14.380 --> 13:15.870
You sure?

13:15.880 --> 13:18.246
Wouldn't want to upset her,

13:18.250 --> 13:19.239
not in her condition, right?

13:19.250 --> 13:20.877
Yeah.

13:20.880 --> 13:23.075
How soon until
we see the results?

13:23.080 --> 13:24.206
Doctor says
tomorrow morning.

13:26.620 --> 13:28.247
[Nicole] Your turn.

13:28.250 --> 13:30.036
Have to look
at Ben's brain now.

13:31.290 --> 13:33.201
[clicks, whirring]

13:41.080 --> 13:43.207
[MRI machine humming]

13:46.000 --> 13:47.991
[movie projector clicking]

14:01.880 --> 14:03.279
[knock on door]

14:07.580 --> 14:08.877
Helen?

14:08.880 --> 14:10.450
Oh.

14:10.460 --> 14:12.746
-[He|en] Hi. [laughs]
-[Maddie] Is everything
all right?

14:12.750 --> 14:14.536
Your message said you needed
to talk to us right away.

14:14.540 --> 14:17.168
Yes. Thank you
for coming over so quickly.

14:21.790 --> 14:24.202
Like TV, but not.

14:26.290 --> 14:27.530
Uh, this is called film.

14:29.210 --> 14:31.610
Those are my parents.

14:31.620 --> 14:34.532
These are the only images
I have of them together.

14:34.540 --> 14:37.748
That bun in the oven,
that's me.

14:37.750 --> 14:41.288
My father died a few weeks
before I was born.

14:41.290 --> 14:43.497
How did Helen's father die?

14:43.500 --> 14:45.991
Brain aneurysm.

14:46.000 --> 14:47.911
At least that's what
I was lead to believe.

14:47.920 --> 14:49.569
What do you mean?

14:49.580 --> 14:51.571
That's why I asked you
to come over.

14:51.580 --> 14:53.116
We have a lot
to catch up on.

14:53.120 --> 14:55.748
We couldn't agree more.

14:55.750 --> 14:57.661
There are more people
like Helen?

14:57.670 --> 14:58.989
More family?

14:59.000 --> 15:01.161
Much more, but...

15:01.170 --> 15:02.410
You think
they're dangerous?

15:02.420 --> 15:04.741
[Helen]
I can't be sure.

15:07.670 --> 15:10.912
I just wish I knew
what wasn't right about it.

15:10.920 --> 15:12.911
What do you think they want?

15:12.920 --> 15:15.821
As far as I can tell,
to know that
their secret is safe.

15:15.830 --> 15:18.742
To protect themselves
from the outside world.

15:18.750 --> 15:21.537
Secrecy hasn't been
a problem for us.

15:21.540 --> 15:24.202
Assuming you can trust
your military friends.

15:24.210 --> 15:26.110
If it wasn't
for their help,

15:26.120 --> 15:28.702
Ryn might not be
sitting here right now.

15:28.710 --> 15:30.325
I'm better now.

15:30.330 --> 15:33.242
And just in time
for dinner tomorrow night.

15:33.250 --> 15:34.820
She invited you, too?

15:40.080 --> 15:41.240
Thanks for the tea.

15:41.250 --> 15:42.285
Mm, all right.

15:43.380 --> 15:44.495
[Ben]
Good night, Helen.

15:51.330 --> 15:54.379
[somber music playing]

16:27.710 --> 16:29.826
I can't believe it's real.

16:29.830 --> 16:32.993
All those myths
about the song.

16:33.000 --> 16:36.163
That it could do something
like this to the human brain.

16:36.170 --> 16:37.569
Amazing.

16:37.580 --> 16:38.956
Which one's which?

16:40.380 --> 16:42.496
Decker's, yours,
and mine.

16:44.500 --> 16:45.819
Decker's very dark.

16:45.830 --> 16:48.162
Yes. Lesions of some sort.

16:50.380 --> 16:52.450
Maddie's not so dark.

16:52.460 --> 16:53.779
[Maddie]
Because it just happened,

16:53.790 --> 16:55.166
and you just sang to me.

16:56.170 --> 16:57.569
But there is
something there.

16:58.880 --> 17:01.075
The damage to yours
seems to be somewhere

17:01.080 --> 17:04.959
between hers
and Aldon Decker's.

17:04.960 --> 17:06.746
Let's hope
it stays that way.

17:06.750 --> 17:08.786
I do this to Ben and Maddie?

17:08.790 --> 17:10.746
Make heads dark?

17:10.750 --> 17:13.321
No. Well,
not intentionally.

17:13.330 --> 17:15.878
The question is,
why is it doing that?

17:17.210 --> 17:18.746
When Ben has struggled
with it,

17:18.750 --> 17:20.786
he seems _
to become more obsessrve.

17:20.790 --> 17:23.327
It seems to tap
into the prefrontal cortex,

17:23.330 --> 17:26.379
which controls_ reason
and emotion.

17:26.380 --> 17:29.577
Another way of saying
"impulse control."

17:29.580 --> 17:32.287
That means how we choose
to act, good or bad.

17:33.920 --> 17:36.878
Song makes you do things
you don't want to.

17:36.880 --> 17:38.279
Like Ryn.

17:38.290 --> 17:41.327
Not exactly.

17:41.330 --> 17:45.414
I think in our case,
it might make us
do things we want to do,

17:45.420 --> 17:47.911
but usually stop
ourselves from doing.

17:47.920 --> 17:49.615
[Maddie] Just because it
makes you more obsessive

17:49.620 --> 17:51.326
doesn't mean
it'll do the same to me.

17:51.330 --> 17:52.991
If it does
anything at all.

17:53.000 --> 17:54.376
[Ben]
Right. Like alcohol.

17:54.380 --> 17:56.245
Drinking affects
everyone differently.

17:56.250 --> 17:58.616
If we could record
the song itself,

17:58.620 --> 17:59.826
we could look
into its effects.

17:59.830 --> 18:01.661
I do this before.

18:01.670 --> 18:03.956
Sing for recording.
For Ben and Maddie.

18:03.960 --> 18:06.030
We've been _
wanting to analyze It,

18:06.040 --> 18:07.029
but not had the means.

18:07.040 --> 18:08.826
Maybe it's the only way.

18:08.830 --> 18:11.617
See if it's a bell
that can be un-rung.

18:11.620 --> 18:14.919
[cell phone ringing]

18:17.460 --> 18:19.701
Hey, Mom?
It's not a really good time.

18:21.080 --> 18:22.115
Dad can't help?

18:24.830 --> 18:26.912
All right.
I'll be right over.

18:28.750 --> 18:30.536
I gotta get
over to my mom's.

18:30.540 --> 18:32.246
She needs help,
doesn't want
to bother my dad.

18:32.250 --> 18:33.990
I'll come with you.

18:34.000 --> 18:35.285
No, you keep working.

18:35.290 --> 18:36.325
I'll see you tonight.

18:37.540 --> 18:38.529
Maddie?

18:39.710 --> 18:41.871
Call me if anything...

18:41.880 --> 18:43.575
You'll be
the first to know.

18:55.380 --> 18:58.452
[pop music playing]

18:58.460 --> 19:02.453

19:08.460 --> 19:11.611
[rock music playing]

19:13.210 --> 19:16.202
[male singer]
Tell me where to hide

19:19.790 --> 19:21.781
[Ben sighs]

19:21.790 --> 19:22.825
[keyboard clicks]

19:26.920 --> 19:27.909
Incredible.

19:29.120 --> 19:30.496
This is my song?

19:30.500 --> 19:32.377
Yeah.
Broken down into pieces.

19:32.380 --> 19:34.701
[fragment of Siren song plays]

19:34.710 --> 19:36.029
Song is broken?

19:36.040 --> 19:38.577
No, no, no.
The-- The pieces are,

19:38.580 --> 19:39.956
mixed together
to make one sound.

19:39.960 --> 19:40.949
One song.

19:40.960 --> 19:41.995
[lower fragment playing]

19:42.000 --> 19:43.706
[higher fragment playing]

19:43.710 --> 19:46.372
One song composed of hundreds
of frequencies and layers.

19:48.040 --> 19:50.281
This many layered frequencies
from one voice.

19:50.290 --> 19:52.110
How is that possible?

19:52.120 --> 19:55.419
All different levels,
polyphonics, amplitudes.

19:55.420 --> 19:56.990
I've never_ seen
anything like It,

19:57.000 --> 19:59.036
not even from whales
or dolphins.

19:59.040 --> 20:01.031
[Nicole] Now that
we've isolated them,

20:01.040 --> 20:02.109
we need to test them
individually.

20:02.120 --> 20:03.030
Yeah, on it.

20:03.040 --> 20:04.450
[fragments playing]

20:04.460 --> 20:06.951
I could listen
In real tIme,

20:06.960 --> 20:08.746
while you monitor each one.

20:08.750 --> 20:10.160
What? Is that safe?

20:11.540 --> 20:14.077
Ben is sure?

20:14.080 --> 20:18.073
If we want answers,
we have to try.

20:28.120 --> 20:29.701
-[light buzzing]
-Must be the circuit breaker.

20:29.710 --> 20:31.280
I'm sorry, Maddie.

20:31.290 --> 20:33.531
-I wouldn't have asked you--
-It's okay.

20:33.540 --> 20:35.747
It's, uh, right here.

20:38.290 --> 20:40.326
So... how are things?

20:40.330 --> 20:41.490
[breaker clicks]

20:42.540 --> 20:43.871
Notgood.

20:43.880 --> 20:46.246
I think all this wiring
might be shot.

20:46.250 --> 20:49.287
No. I meant how are you?

20:49.290 --> 20:52.077
How's Ben?
How's your other friend Ryn?

20:52.080 --> 20:53.570
We're fine, Mom.

20:53.580 --> 20:54.990
You don't have to keep me
in the dark, Maddie.

20:55.000 --> 20:56.956
I'm not that old-fashioned.

20:56.960 --> 20:59.667
People have all kinds
of relationships these days.

20:59.670 --> 21:03.162
I just want to make sure
that yours is healthy.

21:03.170 --> 21:05.035
That looks dangerous.

21:05.040 --> 21:06.371
Not worth you getting hurt.
I'll call the electrician.

21:07.380 --> 21:08.369
Maddie, just leave it.

21:08.380 --> 21:09.745
No! I can fix it!

21:11.040 --> 21:12.200
What a piece of crap.

21:15.080 --> 21:16.820
-Maddie, just--
-Leave me alone!

21:16.830 --> 21:18.115
Aah!

21:21.250 --> 21:22.239
What's gotten into you?

21:23.290 --> 21:25.167
Something's wrong.

21:25.170 --> 21:26.785
Talk to me.

21:28.880 --> 21:30.279
I have to go.

21:30.290 --> 21:31.780
[screwdriver clatters]

21:34.670 --> 21:35.989
Maddie!

21:44.790 --> 21:47.076
Ben and Maddie
are very close to you.

21:47.080 --> 21:49.708
Very protective of you.

21:49.710 --> 21:51.871
Does your song have
anything to do with that?

21:51.880 --> 21:54.280
Not just song.

21:54.290 --> 21:56.281
With Ben and Maddie,
it is more.

21:56.290 --> 21:57.416
More?

21:57.420 --> 22:00.878
Yes. Ryn loves
Ben and Maddie.

22:02.420 --> 22:05.071
Ryn makes love
with Ben and Maddie.

22:14.170 --> 22:15.205
[overheadphones]
Ready?

22:15.210 --> 22:18.111
Yeah. Let's do this.

22:18.120 --> 22:19.496
Here we go.

22:19.500 --> 22:20.819
The song in full.

22:20.830 --> 22:22.616
All frequencies.

22:22.620 --> 22:27.375
[Siren song playing]

22:35.960 --> 22:38.201
[monitors beeping]

22:42.620 --> 22:44.372
My song does this?

22:44.380 --> 22:48.282
[Siren song continuing]

22:50.120 --> 22:51.667
Whoa.

22:51.670 --> 22:53.376
[song continuing]

22:53.380 --> 22:55.371
I'm going to play
the frequencies
I was able to isolate.

22:55.380 --> 22:56.608
See how they affect you.

22:59.000 --> 23:00.206
[beeping]

23:02.170 --> 23:05.617
[varying pitches playing]

23:09.500 --> 23:10.489
[Dawson] Incredible.

23:10.500 --> 23:12.616
[Nicole] What?

23:12.620 --> 23:16.454
Most humans can hear
frequencies between
20 hertz and 20,000.

23:16.460 --> 23:18.109
Sea creatures,
like some dolphins,

23:18.120 --> 23:20.532
can hear frequencies
up to 100,000 hertz,

23:20.540 --> 23:23.612
while_some whales can
hear InfrasonIc sounds
as low as seven hertz.

23:23.620 --> 23:25.702
The range
of these frequencies,

23:25.710 --> 23:27.666
they're unlike
anything I've ever seen.

23:27.670 --> 23:29.114
[beeping]

23:30.920 --> 23:35.493
[varying pitches playing]

23:50.830 --> 23:55.164
[sound intensifying]

23:55.170 --> 23:56.535
Ben is in pain?

24:00.120 --> 24:01.371
[hissing]

24:05.040 --> 24:08.578
[loud discordant notes]

24:08.580 --> 24:10.241
[Ryn screaming]

24:11.580 --> 24:13.957
-Stop this!
-[recording stops]

24:13.960 --> 24:16.451
[breathing heavily]

24:19.790 --> 24:23.783
[rock music playing
in The Anchor]

24:23.790 --> 24:25.667
[customers conversing]

24:27.830 --> 24:30.037
So, uh,
anything show up?

24:30.040 --> 24:32.497
When they were looking
at your brain, or whatever.

24:32.500 --> 24:34.570
Still running
more tests, but...

24:34.580 --> 24:36.457
everything looks okay.

24:38.460 --> 24:39.449
Good.

24:42.500 --> 24:45.242
This, um, song thing,

24:45.250 --> 24:46.660
what does it do to you?

24:46.670 --> 24:48.319
I mean, besides make you
drink before 5:00

24:48.330 --> 24:50.457
or move to Iowa.

24:50.460 --> 24:51.449
[laughs]

24:51.460 --> 24:53.746
All depends on the person.

24:53.750 --> 24:55.240
I know I feel good.

24:55.250 --> 24:56.820
I think
that's the IPA talking.

24:56.830 --> 24:58.115
[laughs] What?

25:02.420 --> 25:03.876
Wanted to tell you,

25:03.880 --> 25:06.280
I'm glad
you're doing better.

25:07.710 --> 25:09.530
You're a good guy, Xan.

25:09.540 --> 25:11.167
You deserve to be happy.

25:12.210 --> 25:13.279
Thanks.

25:14.960 --> 25:17.781
You know, so do you.

25:17.790 --> 25:19.417
It's good to see
that you're

25:19.420 --> 25:21.206
giving yourself
a break for a change.

25:21.210 --> 25:22.609
You weren't always
the Maddie who felt like

25:22.620 --> 25:24.030
she had to take care
of everyone else.

25:24.040 --> 25:26.031
[laughs]

25:27.710 --> 25:30.417
Not always having
to control everything?

25:30.420 --> 25:32.741
Just doing what feels right
in the moment.

25:32.750 --> 25:35.116
I forgot what it's like.

25:35.120 --> 25:36.826
-Feels good.
-Yeah, I bet.

25:36.830 --> 25:38.457
[laughing] Yeah.

25:38.460 --> 25:39.916
[Siren song echoing]

25:39.920 --> 25:41.785
Whoa. Hey.

25:41.790 --> 25:42.916
What are you doing?

25:47.000 --> 25:48.160
Maddie.

25:49.210 --> 25:50.416
Maddie.

25:50.420 --> 25:51.409
[door opens]

25:52.710 --> 25:54.029
[door closes]

25:55.040 --> 25:57.611
[boat horn blows]

25:59.880 --> 26:02.872
Ryn, remember,
we're pretending

26:02.880 --> 26:05.246
that we're
just friends, okay?

26:05.250 --> 26:07.912
But more than friends.

26:07.920 --> 26:09.911
Ryn lie?

26:09.920 --> 26:11.035
Yeah, kind of.

26:12.710 --> 26:15.873
But this is
for my mom's sake.

26:15.880 --> 26:17.745
You helped her
in the hospital.

26:17.750 --> 26:19.160
She wants to thank you.

26:19.170 --> 26:21.536
She doesn't need
to know any more than that.

26:22.580 --> 26:23.660
Not right now.

26:25.290 --> 26:26.370
Brother!

26:26.380 --> 26:27.779
-Hey, man.
-Hey.

26:30.670 --> 26:31.739
And who might this be?

26:31.750 --> 26:33.320
This is Ryn,

26:33.330 --> 26:35.571
Maddie's exchange student
friend from Finland.

26:37.040 --> 26:38.917
Wait a minute. You_--
You look really famIIIar.

26:40.880 --> 26:41.869
[snaps]

26:41.880 --> 26:43.199
It was a pool party

26:43.210 --> 26:44.370
at the Siren Song Motel
a while back, right?

26:44.380 --> 26:45.699
Yes.

26:47.420 --> 26:48.785
All right.
Well, let me take that.

26:48.790 --> 26:49.916
-Come on inside, guys.
-All right.

26:53.000 --> 26:56.538
I have to admit,
I was surprised
to hear from you.

26:56.540 --> 26:57.780
[laughs]

26:57.790 --> 27:00.998
Much less find myself
sitting in your home.

27:01.000 --> 27:02.615
We're family, Helen.

27:02.620 --> 27:04.827
It threw me for a loop
when I found out,

27:04.830 --> 27:08.414
but I think maybe
it's time we started
acting like it.

27:08.420 --> 27:10.160
I agree.

27:10.170 --> 27:11.956
[soft jazz playing]

27:11.960 --> 27:13.496
-Mom.
-Hey.

27:13.500 --> 27:14.876
You look so good.

27:14.880 --> 27:16.245
[laughs]

27:16.250 --> 27:17.410
I'm so glad
you made it.

27:19.000 --> 27:22.288
I see you brought
my favorite new person.

27:22.290 --> 27:23.780
It's so good
to see you again.

27:23.790 --> 27:25.951
Ryn-- friend from Finland.

27:25.960 --> 27:27.450
How lovely.

27:27.460 --> 27:28.666
Where's Maddie?

27:28.670 --> 27:29.955
She's held up.

27:29.960 --> 27:30.779
She'||-- She'll be here.

27:32.250 --> 27:33.911
Ben.

27:33.920 --> 27:34.818
Dad.

27:37.920 --> 27:39.410
I'm sorry.
I don't think we've met.

27:39.420 --> 27:40.910
I'm Ted, Ben's father.

27:40.920 --> 27:42.990
This is Ryn, Ben's friend.

27:43.000 --> 27:44.615
From Finland.

27:44.620 --> 27:46.827
Oh, wow.
What city you from?

27:46.830 --> 27:48.491
No city.

27:48.500 --> 27:50.206
Mm. A country girl.
I like it.

27:50.210 --> 27:51.450
Yeah.

27:51.460 --> 27:52.870
Well, it's nice
to meet you, Ryn.

27:52.880 --> 27:54.871
You mind ifI steal him
for a second?

27:54.880 --> 27:56.495
Stealing is bad.

27:56.500 --> 27:58.115
[laughter]

27:58.120 --> 28:00.327
It's okay.
I'll be right back.

28:10.040 --> 28:11.951
So I don't know what kind
of strings you pulled,

28:11.960 --> 28:15.532
but, uh,
your mother's recovery
is progressing

28:15.540 --> 28:17.167
extremely well.

28:17.170 --> 28:18.455
She told you.

28:18.460 --> 28:20.826
Yeah. After the fact,
if you ask me.

28:20.830 --> 28:22.240
Why the hell
didn't you tell me?

28:22.250 --> 28:23.615
What were you thinking, huh?

28:23.620 --> 28:25.030
Dad, there was no time.

28:25.040 --> 28:26.450
IfI had told you,

28:26.460 --> 28:28.030
would you have ever
gone along with it?

28:29.880 --> 28:31.780
Look, it was
Mom's choice, Dad.

28:31.790 --> 28:32.950
She made it.

28:34.830 --> 28:36.878
Your mother gets
her mind set on something,

28:39.000 --> 28:40.956
trying to change it
is an exercise in futility.

28:41.960 --> 28:44.611
Yeah.
On that we can agree.

28:45.790 --> 28:49.954
So, you two met
in the hospital?

28:49.960 --> 28:51.029
-Mm-hmm.
-Yes.

28:51.040 --> 28:52.496
I help Ben's mother.

28:52.500 --> 28:53.876
She sure did.

28:53.880 --> 28:55.666
Visited me at my worst.

28:55.670 --> 28:57.035
Alleviated the pain.

28:57.040 --> 28:58.826
How did she do that?

28:58.830 --> 29:01.617
I'm not sure, actually.

29:01.620 --> 29:06.068
She just sort of placed
her hands above me and

29:06.080 --> 29:07.377
sang.

29:08.460 --> 29:09.666
She sang to you?

29:09.670 --> 29:11.490
Not song.

29:11.500 --> 29:15.038
Different sound.
For helping.

29:16.670 --> 29:18.285
Well, whatever it was,
I need to download it,

29:18.290 --> 29:20.451
because it worked wonders.

29:23.540 --> 29:24.950
By the way,

29:24.960 --> 29:27.918
I got a copy of that video
from Klesco Oil.

29:27.920 --> 29:29.490
Want to get
your take on this.

29:29.500 --> 29:33.288
They say no human can
possibly swim this deep.

29:33.290 --> 29:34.826
You're the expert.
What do you think?

29:34.830 --> 29:36.741
[drill grinding]

29:39.710 --> 29:41.416
[Ben] Looks
like someone is playing

29:41.420 --> 29:43.206
a very good trick
on Klesco.

29:43.210 --> 29:44.996
What do you mean?

29:45.000 --> 29:48.492
Like you said,
there's no other explanation.

29:48.500 --> 29:50.616
It just makes no sense.

29:52.290 --> 29:54.326
I'm curious, how did
you and Ben become friends?

29:54.330 --> 29:56.912
Ben almost hit me
WIth car.

29:56.920 --> 29:58.205
Um...

29:58.210 --> 29:59.700
Avid bicyclist,
this one.

29:59.710 --> 30:00.916
-Oh.
-[He|en laughs]

30:00.920 --> 30:02.535
Thank God
she had a helmet on, hmm?

30:04.080 --> 30:05.206
How are you guys doing?

30:05.210 --> 30:07.075
Oh, just in time.

30:07.080 --> 30:08.991
I need a drink.

30:10.040 --> 30:11.109
Ryn?

30:12.580 --> 30:13.911
Mom, I know
I already said it,

30:13.920 --> 30:16.992
but, really,
you look so great.

30:17.000 --> 30:20.163
Well, I can't wait to start
feeling even better.

30:20.170 --> 30:22.206
Yeah, slow but steady.

30:22.210 --> 30:23.825
I hope not too slow.

30:23.830 --> 30:25.878
Do you know when I'll
be getting my next dose?

30:27.790 --> 30:30.782
I'm not sure.

30:30.790 --> 30:32.030
I'll talk to the doctor.

30:32.040 --> 30:33.416
Great.

30:35.790 --> 30:37.246

32:48.250 --> 32:50.286
I'm so happy
you could all join us.

32:52.290 --> 32:55.248
Yeah. I'd like
to thank you all
for coming.

32:55.250 --> 32:56.660
Our family's been
through a lot.

32:57.960 --> 32:59.746
Means more to me
than you know.

32:59.750 --> 33:01.957
Being
in the hospital, uh,

33:01.960 --> 33:05.248
made me _realize
what's really Important.

33:05.250 --> 33:06.319
To family.

33:06.330 --> 33:07.786
Yeah.

33:07.790 --> 33:09.200
[Ted] To new friends,

33:09.210 --> 33:10.950
and to those
who matter most.

Maddie! Oh, you made it.

33:13.460 --> 33:14.996
I'm so glad.

33:15.000 --> 33:17.616
Um, please sit.
You're just in time.

33:17.620 --> 33:20.578
So Sylvia has prepared
her world famous duck roast.

33:20.580 --> 33:22.241
It should be one
for the books.

33:23.290 --> 33:24.279
You okay?

33:24.290 --> 33:25.780
Yeah.

33:30.330 --> 33:32.207
All right.

33:35.250 --> 33:38.287
You've known
Maddie the longest
out of all her friends.

33:39.620 --> 33:42.032
Probably knew her
better than I ever did.

33:43.670 --> 33:47.071
I guess I thought
if anyone can tell me

33:47.080 --> 33:49.412
what's really
going on with her,

33:49.420 --> 33:50.455
it might be you.

33:50.460 --> 33:52.917
[sighs] Well, she's--

33:52.920 --> 33:54.456
She's had
a rough few months.

33:54.460 --> 33:55.870
Yeah.

33:55.880 --> 33:57.245
Lots of work stress.

33:58.580 --> 34:00.241
But you know Maddie.

34:00.250 --> 34:03.242
She's a fighter, yeah?

34:03.250 --> 34:04.706
Whatever's getting her
worked up, don't worry,

34:04.710 --> 34:06.746
she'll bounce back.

34:06.750 --> 34:10.117
I don't mean
to sound closed-minded,

34:10.120 --> 34:13.283
and it's not that _I care
that she's seeIng
more than one person,

34:13.290 --> 34:15.076
man or woman, it's just--

34:15.080 --> 34:17.287
Um... Um, uh...

34:17.290 --> 34:18.746
I'm sor--
What do you mean?

34:18.750 --> 34:21.457
Her being
with Ben and Ryn?

34:22.750 --> 34:23.785
They're...

34:25.380 --> 34:27.610
You know, together.

34:27.620 --> 34:28.700
[laughing]

34:28.710 --> 34:31.110
Come on. No, no, it's--

34:31.120 --> 34:32.417
Ryn's a-- She's--

34:34.330 --> 34:35.615
Wait.

34:36.620 --> 34:40.329
So Ryn and Maddie

34:42.040 --> 34:43.416
and Ben--

34:43.420 --> 34:46.207
Are in a relationship
together.

34:46.210 --> 34:49.168
In the biblical sense.

34:49.170 --> 34:50.410
Ryn told me herself.

34:51.960 --> 34:52.949
You didn't know?

34:52.960 --> 34:53.995
[coughs]

35:04.790 --> 35:07.452
Ryn, when are you
going back to Finland?

35:08.960 --> 35:12.282
Ryn is on a...
an extended visa program.

35:12.290 --> 35:15.111
I stay on land.
My choice.

35:16.290 --> 35:18.918
Ted, can I ask you
something?

35:18.920 --> 35:20.911
The old well out the back,

35:20.920 --> 35:22.319
how long's it been there?

35:22.330 --> 35:23.820
Hmm?

35:23.830 --> 35:26.242
By the garden.
I've seen it before.

35:26.250 --> 35:27.911
[Elaine]
Maddie, I, uh...

35:27.920 --> 35:29.876
I happened to see
your mother a few weeks ago.

35:29.880 --> 35:32.030
She looked great.

35:32.040 --> 35:33.667
Oh. Thanks.

35:33.670 --> 35:35.535
I'm sure it's been
a-- a long road,

35:35.540 --> 35:38.247
but I was really happy
to see her doing better.

35:38.250 --> 35:41.117
Me too. Very happy.

35:43.620 --> 35:45.872

And if-- I mean,
when I feel up to it,

35:49.080 --> 35:51.378
I want to come and see you
at the Research Center.

35:51.380 --> 35:52.529
Been way too long.

35:52.540 --> 35:55.532
[Elaine continues indistinctly]

35:59.460 --> 36:01.200
[Ryn's voice echoing]
Is Maddie mad?

36:05.000 --> 36:07.241
Maddie is not okay.

36:08.540 --> 36:11.418
No. Not okay.

36:11.420 --> 36:13.877
Because Maddie lie.

36:15.420 --> 36:17.376
Ryn doesn't want to lie.

36:19.000 --> 36:20.991
Not about being
with Ben and Maddie.

36:22.420 --> 36:23.614
[Ryn]
Others should know.

36:23.620 --> 36:24.746
But--

36:24.750 --> 36:26.957
We are in love.

36:26.960 --> 36:30.202
Yes. We're in love.

I'm sorry. Excuse me.

37:12.250 --> 37:13.615
Uh... [clears throat]

37:13.620 --> 37:15.611
She hasn't been
feeling well.

37:15.620 --> 37:18.202
-Oh.
-Excuse me. I should...

37:18.210 --> 37:19.199
I should, uh--

37:23.460 --> 37:24.529
Uh, well...

37:24.540 --> 37:26.246
Thank you for food.

37:43.330 --> 37:44.536
[rat squeaking]

38:01.210 --> 38:04.668
-[keyboard clicks]
-[Siren song playing]

38:06.120 --> 38:07.747
[squeaking]

38:07.750 --> 38:09.661
[Siren song continuing]

38:09.670 --> 38:10.739
You playing
the right one?

38:10.750 --> 38:11.819
Yes, ma'am.

38:14.540 --> 38:16.110
Turn it up.

38:19.380 --> 38:24.204
[Siren song playing louder]

38:24.210 --> 38:26.701
[distressed squeaks]

38:26.710 --> 38:28.496
Shut it off!

38:28.500 --> 38:31.207
[screeching]

38:31.210 --> 38:32.996
I said--

38:33.000 --> 38:34.240
[Siren song stops]

38:42.960 --> 38:44.450
[clears throat]

38:44.460 --> 38:46.576
Don't mean to disturb you.

38:46.580 --> 38:48.116
Oh, no, come on in.

38:48.120 --> 38:51.453
Sorry I was so, uh,
distracted at dinner.

38:51.460 --> 38:52.950
It's understandable.

38:52.960 --> 38:54.530
That was quite the show.

38:54.540 --> 38:56.201
[laughs]
That's one way to put it.

38:56.210 --> 38:57.780
I just hope those three
figure it out,

38:57.790 --> 38:58.825
whatever it is.

38:58.830 --> 39:00.115
Yeah.

39:00.120 --> 39:01.872
You were asking
about the, uh...

39:01.880 --> 39:03.029
the well?

39:03.040 --> 39:04.280
It adds
a lot of character

39:04.290 --> 39:05.450
to the property,
don't you think?

39:05.460 --> 39:07.200
Oh, sure does.

39:07.210 --> 39:10.828
There used to be
a cottage next to It,
am I right?

39:10.830 --> 39:12.491
That's right.
How'd you know that?

39:12.500 --> 39:14.741
I don't know
how to explain this.

39:14.750 --> 39:18.789
I believe my mother
and father lived there.

39:18.790 --> 39:19.916
What?

39:19.920 --> 39:22.662
I have an old home movie
of them,

39:22.670 --> 39:24.911
taken just
before I was born.

39:24.920 --> 39:27.741
I must've watched it
a hundred times,

39:27.750 --> 39:30.207
but_I never knew it was
In your backyard.

39:30.210 --> 39:32.576
The cottage, do you know
what happened to it?

39:32.580 --> 39:35.663
[exhales]
Uh, fire, I think.

39:35.670 --> 39:38.377
But, like I said,
it was before my time.

39:38.380 --> 39:41.326
I remember seeing it
in a bunch of old
family photo albums,

39:41.330 --> 39:43.207
but, uh, I never
really thought much of it.

39:44.290 --> 39:45.279
I figured it was
for storage.

39:46.460 --> 39:48.701
Seems that wasn't the case.

39:48.710 --> 39:51.747
[female singer]
Oh-oh oh-oh-oh oh-oh

39:51.750 --> 39:53.456
Oh-oh oh-oh

39:55.500 --> 39:57.707
You said I had discretion
in how I conducted
my relationship--

39:57.710 --> 39:59.996
Relax, you're not in trouble.

40:00.000 --> 40:02.286
I want to thank you,
actually.

40:03.380 --> 40:04.369
You've been a big help.

40:05.620 --> 40:08.373
Now, this... sound.

40:08.380 --> 40:11.201
This song.
Whatever it is,

40:12.710 --> 40:14.746
make it your top priority.

40:14.750 --> 40:16.820
Oh-oh oh-oh

40:16.830 --> 40:19.617
This is gonna be
the death of me

40:19.620 --> 40:22.032
The death of me, yeah

40:24.420 --> 40:26.536
I still can't believe
what I said.

40:26.540 --> 40:29.703
Your mom probably thinks
I'm a basket case.

40:29.710 --> 40:33.419
Look, the song affects
everyone differently.

40:33.420 --> 40:34.819
It wasn't you.

40:34.830 --> 40:36.570
Wasn't it?

40:36.580 --> 40:38.411
Wasn't it what
I really wanted to say

40:38.420 --> 40:41.662
and just didn't stop
myself from saying it?

40:44.540 --> 40:48.374
Look, we have
to keep experimenting
on the recording.

40:48.380 --> 40:50.450
Find a solution.

40:50.460 --> 40:52.746
No more dark spots.

40:52.750 --> 40:55.787
It won't be long
until your mom needs
another injection.

40:55.790 --> 40:57.417
If we keep
taking stem cells,

40:57.420 --> 40:58.739
Ryn will need to sing
to someone again

40:58.750 --> 40:59.876
to counteract the effects.

40:59.880 --> 41:01.245
Sh_e'|| have
to SIng to me.

41:02.380 --> 41:04.200
I can't stop now.

41:04.210 --> 41:05.950
We don't know how much more
your braIn can take.

41:07.330 --> 41:08.877
Then we better
figure something out,

41:10.920 --> 41:12.239
and quick.

41:12.250 --> 41:14.741
Oh-oh oh-oh

41:14.750 --> 41:17.116
This is gonna be
the death of me

41:17.120 --> 41:20.374
The death of me, yeah

41:22.380 --> 41:25.076
[high-pitched call]

41:28.120 --> 41:30.998
[music playing]
