01:07.154 --> 01:10.105
All right, Davey, here comes the airplane.

01:10.509 --> 01:13.336
What did they say to kids to get them to open their mouths before there were planes?

01:13.427 --> 01:15.199
- "Here comes the choo-choo." 
- And before there were trains?

01:15.281 --> 01:17.324
- "Here comes the spoon." 
- That's so on the nose.

01:17.441 --> 01:20.190
One more bite, honey. Come on, now. Here comes the airplane again.

01:20.325 --> 01:22.987
It's flying through the air. It's beginning its descent.

01:23.134 --> 01:25.972
It's commencing its approach. It's lowering the landing gear.

01:26.054 --> 01:28.404
It's signaled the ground crew. They're flipping their flashlight thingies.

01:28.439 --> 01:29.781
Would you shove that in the kid's mouth?

01:29.887 --> 01:32.627
Oh, look -- it's Bilbo Baloneypuss just in from the shire.

01:32.704 --> 01:34.609
- Just hurry up and order. 
- What's the rush?

01:34.685 --> 01:35.765
I don't like babies.

01:37.554 --> 01:40.047
I suddenly felt violently protective.

01:40.251 --> 01:42.919
- It's gone. 
- It's the noise they make.

01:43.007 --> 01:45.716
- This baby has not made a peep. 
- He will and at the worst possible moment.

01:45.781 --> 01:48.854
- Like when you're defusing a bomb or something? 
- That would be awkward.

01:48.935 --> 01:51.387
You've got one minute to order, then six minutes to eat.

01:51.515 --> 01:54.266
Yessiree, come on down to Luke's, where the motto is "eat it, then beat it."

01:54.332 --> 01:54.823
One minute.

01:56.174 --> 01:57.091
Hello, all.

01:58.832 --> 02:00.311
- Taylor. 
- Top o' the morning to you.

02:00.557 --> 02:03.589
- Top o' the... 
- Yeah, on top there, you got the...

02:03.712 --> 02:06.344
- It's definitely -- it's a... 
- Beautiful top. It's...

02:06.590 --> 02:09.727
Top o' the morning right back at you. You were just on a cruise, weren't you?

02:09.824 --> 02:12.555
Yes, and it was heaven. The Caribbean -- ever been?

02:13.859 --> 02:16.307
- I'm sorry. What did you say? 
- Ever been to the Caribbean?

02:17.378 --> 02:18.856
God, I'm sorry. I missed it again.

02:19.721 --> 02:22.953
Never mind. Luke, I have an issue I need to discuss with you.

02:23.164 --> 02:24.990
Good -- something to write about in my diary.

02:25.093 --> 02:27.521
There is a distinct odor outside our establishments,

02:27.591 --> 02:29.256
and I have to assume it's coming from the diner.

02:29.466 --> 02:30.821
There's no odor coming from my diner.

02:30.921 --> 02:33.669
It wasn't there when I left for my trip. Where else could it be emanating from?

02:33.808 --> 02:36.162
I don't know. Have you checked underneath that thing on your head?

02:36.280 --> 02:39.132
- I'm combing it differently. 
- The comb didn't loosen the glue?

02:40.217 --> 02:43.682
You know, I smelled something, too, but it was across the square.

02:43.981 --> 02:46.376
Me, too, over by the hair stand -- newsstand.

02:46.443 --> 02:48.292
I smelled it by Gypsy's -- horrible.

02:48.533 --> 02:50.965
So the whole town smells? How can that be possible?

02:51.103 --> 02:54.047
- It is an old town -- 200 years. 
- So, it's decaying from age?

02:54.139 --> 02:57.780
- Or we've got skunks again. 
- I think you're right, Taylor!

02:57.861 --> 03:00.319
Ten years ago we got infested. They crawled under houses,

03:00.401 --> 03:02.766
met their fate, and the town smelled for weeks.

03:02.855 --> 03:05.485
That must be it, Taylor! Good work. Good work!

03:05.669 --> 03:08.634
Thank you, Kirk. I'm going to have to mobilize the community.

03:08.681 --> 03:11.219
We've got the flower show coming up. We have to deal with this quickly.

03:11.444 --> 03:15.510
Let me go door to door and make sure every townsman looks under his house, Taylor.

03:15.826 --> 03:18.455
I'll even knock some heads together -- get medieval on their ass.

03:18.597 --> 03:22.525
That's a nice offer, Kirk, but the block captains will see it gets done.

03:22.641 --> 03:24.050
I better start making my calls.

03:24.962 --> 03:26.943
- Your minute's up. Order. 
- We're not ready.

03:27.040 --> 03:28.515
Then it's coming out of your eating time.

03:28.597 --> 03:30.967
Hey, get violently protective so Luke will back off.

03:31.045 --> 03:33.072
- I don't know if I can summon it like that. 
- Try.

03:35.172 --> 03:37.869
- Luke. 
- In five minutes, you're all gone.

03:39.097 --> 03:40.245
I let you down.

03:40.387 --> 03:42.570
The "argh" was good, and then you kind of petered out.

03:42.707 --> 03:44.714
-  I need to practice more. 
- You'll get it there.

03:44.898 --> 03:45.600
Read, read.

04:43.180 --> 04:46.524
- Try it against that wall there. 
- We've already tried it there.

04:46.750 --> 04:49.052
- It's no problem. 
- No problem for you,

04:49.129 --> 04:53.247
but this is giving me cuticle damage. Do you know how long cuticle damage takes to heal?

04:53.339 --> 04:55.613
- Thank God, no. 
- No, it doesn't work there either.

04:55.965 --> 04:57.783
What an enormous shock.

04:57.942 --> 04:59.776
Anywhere else you want to try it --

04:59.928 --> 05:02.647
maybe at the Lincoln Memorial on his giant lap?

05:03.159 --> 05:05.207
- How 'bout over there? 
- Yeah, there.

05:05.606 --> 05:07.265
I'm sending you my manicure bill.

05:07.378 --> 05:09.543
- Yes, mine, too. 
- Don't be snotty.

05:09.877 --> 05:11.961
Seems a little out of place no matter where you put it.

05:12.032 --> 05:13.056
Yeah, unfortunately.

05:13.398 --> 05:16.277
If you'd ordered it from me, I would have guaranteed it. You didn't order it from me.

05:16.342 --> 05:18.682
I know, we ordered it before we hired you. We should have waited.

05:18.759 --> 05:21.955
- It's always best to do it through your contractor. 
- I don't think it fits here.

05:22.092 --> 05:25.447
- Oh, my God, I'm getting a blister. 
- Hey, how about by the front desk?

05:25.564 --> 05:28.309
- We could give it a shot. 
- That's it! I'm jumping off the Amistad.

05:28.385 --> 05:30.361
This is heavy, my back hurts, I'm not moving it again.

05:30.428 --> 05:31.130
No problem.

05:33.183 --> 05:33.925
I can do it.

05:35.390 --> 05:38.293
- It's not me. It really is heavy. 
- You mean here?

05:38.611 --> 05:41.160
- They already tried it there. 
- I think it's a lost cause.

05:41.268 --> 05:44.232
- We've got the Dennis Kucinich of bookcases. 
- I wish you'd gone through me.

05:44.365 --> 05:46.188
I could just give it to Rory. She could use it at Yale.

05:47.057 --> 05:48.046
- Hi, everybody. 
- Hi!

05:48.585 --> 05:50.372
- Hi, Michel. 
- Hi, Lindsay.

05:51.179 --> 05:53.315
Are you okay? You're standing kind of funny.

05:53.422 --> 05:56.976
It's nothing funny. It is how you stand in these pants.

05:59.582 --> 06:01.676
- Keys, please. 
- You got it.

06:03.555 --> 06:05.194
Annette and Frankie really found each other.

06:05.291 --> 06:07.677
They float together. Y'know, they just sort of float.

06:07.840 --> 06:09.838
- It's off-the-charts adorable. 
- Yep.

06:10.092 --> 06:12.556
The Deans of the world always get the Lindsays.

06:12.679 --> 06:15.387
The pretty little things just like the bookcase lifters.

06:15.537 --> 06:17.646
That's a category -- jocks, nerds, bookcase lifters?

06:17.743 --> 06:20.534
I was born with this bad back. It was heretical.

06:20.620 --> 06:21.337
Congenital.

06:21.470 --> 06:24.686
Well, I hate that bookcase. I wish you had never ordered it.

06:24.820 --> 06:28.066
I wish you had never thought of it. I can't even be in the same room with it,

06:28.142 --> 06:30.876
- mocking me for how alone I am. 
- It's mocking you?

06:30.978 --> 06:34.511
- It's three pieces of wood. 
- Well, I hate it -- hate it, hate it, hate it!

06:35.450 --> 06:39.202
If you had ordered it from me, he wouldn't be experiencing this psychological trauma.

06:42.427 --> 06:46.129
I mean, they were extremely common until just recently -- historically recently,

06:46.212 --> 06:49.606
not recently like "metrosexual is a word now" recently, but recently.

06:49.801 --> 06:53.728
- Are we still talking about anvils? 
- Yes, where did all the anvils go?

06:53.933 --> 06:56.037
You're talking about those big, heavy, metal things?

06:56.107 --> 06:58.965
That blacksmiths hammered horseshoes and stuff on. Everyone had them.

06:59.063 --> 07:02.667
They were featured prominently in every movie western, so where did they all go?

07:02.754 --> 07:04.285
I don't know that they were that common.

07:04.346 --> 07:06.978
Wile E. Coyote used them. That's how common they were.

07:07.049 --> 07:08.057
- Who? 
- The cartoon.

07:08.166 --> 07:10.946
He was always trying to drop an anvil on the Road Runner's head

07:11.024 --> 07:14.545
or shoot it at him out of a giant slingshot or fire it at him out of a cannon.

07:14.616 --> 07:18.421
Inevitably, the cannon tilted up, shot it in the air, it fell down,

07:18.546 --> 07:21.166
and made an anvil-shaped impression on Wile E. Coyote's head.

07:21.248 --> 07:23.908
- This is a cartoon? 
- No, no, this just happened to me the other day.

07:24.003 --> 07:27.044
I was walking down the street, and this giant anvil -- yes, mother, it's a cartoon.

07:27.116 --> 07:29.491
I know she sounds nuts, but it's a very common cartoon.

07:29.584 --> 07:31.667
But that doesn't prove that anvils were so common.

07:31.748 --> 07:34.933
It does. It proves that anvils were so ubiquitous at one point --

07:35.220 --> 07:37.216
- is that the word, ubiquitous? 
- It depends on where you're going.

07:37.309 --> 07:40.381
That they knew that children would know what they were and delight in them.

07:40.484 --> 07:43.197
That's how common they were -- children watching cartoons.

07:43.248 --> 07:45.638
- That was the word. 
- I've forgotten your point.

07:45.711 --> 07:47.360
Where are all the anvils?

07:47.483 --> 07:51.686
I mean, is there some sort of secret anvil storage facility the government is keeping from us?

07:51.754 --> 07:55.285
Or they fell into disuse with the advent of other technologies,

07:55.338 --> 07:57.195
and so they melted them down and they're gone.

07:57.262 --> 07:58.403
But they're not supposed to melt.

07:58.497 --> 08:01.410
They were made to withstand the red-hot hammer of the town blacksmith.

08:01.480 --> 08:04.476
This is easily the most pointless conversation we've ever had.

08:04.564 --> 08:06.641
I don't hear anyone chiming in with rational theories.

08:06.970 --> 08:09.631
Please change the subject, I beg of you, anyone.

08:10.129 --> 08:12.955
Well the girls don't know the big news about Jason and me.

08:13.038 --> 08:13.681
You're pregnant?

08:13.933 --> 08:15.644
- We're acquiring another company. 
- I was close.

08:15.900 --> 08:18.059
Already? You just started yours.

08:18.116 --> 08:21.029
The insurance business is changing so rapidly, you have to adapt to keep up.

08:21.112 --> 08:23.764
- It's a dog-eat-dog world, Grandpa. 
- Don't get the wrong idea.

08:23.836 --> 08:26.687
It's not a big company. It's smaller than ours, but very powerful.

08:26.774 --> 08:30.210
Wait, the company is smaller than yours? Your company is two guys -- you and Jason.

08:30.282 --> 08:32.841
This company is a one-man operation -- Bob Sutton.

08:32.913 --> 08:34.500
So, you're acquiring Bob?

08:34.618 --> 08:37.304
We're acquiring his company, and his company is him.

08:37.373 --> 08:39.246
Did he have to give himself two weeks' notice?

08:39.533 --> 08:42.806
Is there gonna be a sad little going-away party where he brings in his own cake

08:42.876 --> 08:44.115
and blows out his candles?

08:44.222 --> 08:47.499
We are all celebrating with a dinner tomorrow -- us and the wives.

08:47.540 --> 08:50.940
- You're not big on the Bob? 
- Bob's fine. We've known him for years.

08:50.997 --> 08:53.920
It's that dolt he's married to -- classic trophy wife.

08:54.022 --> 08:55.671
- She is quite young. 
- How young?

08:55.789 --> 08:57.498
Her car looks just like Barbie's.

08:57.597 --> 08:59.875
Regardless, I hope you will be kind to her at dinner.

08:59.977 --> 09:02.194
I'll have to bring my English-to-dumbbell dictionary.

09:02.363 --> 09:04.723
Try and focus on Bob. Bob's as sharp as they come.

09:04.800 --> 09:06.634
He's very brilliant, I'll give you that.

09:06.777 --> 09:08.686
- Bob's brilliant, huh? 
- He's a Rhodes scholar.

09:08.820 --> 09:10.386
Ask him where the anvils went.

09:12.896 --> 09:13.566
Or not.

09:17.222 --> 09:21.057
And forty-seven cents comes to $5. Thank you, Mrs. Cassini.

09:21.174 --> 09:23.432
Thank you. I don't know what it is about you, Taylor,

09:23.549 --> 09:27.222
but you look so healthy, so invigorated, so youthful.

09:27.324 --> 09:29.659
Thank you, Mrs. Cassini. Must be the vacation.

09:29.813 --> 09:30.955
Or the fake hair.

09:32.378 --> 09:33.653
Come again, Mrs. Cassini.

09:35.054 --> 09:38.702
Tracy, change out the scoop water. It's an unsightly color.

09:38.849 --> 09:41.486
And tell Franklin when he gets here...

09:42.408 --> 09:45.427
tell him that he keeps forgetting to punch out...

09:46.609 --> 09:49.669
- Kirk, something wrong? 
- Well, I...

09:50.166 --> 09:51.515
Don't touch the candy.

09:51.644 --> 09:54.000
I'm sorry. I didn't want to touch the candy. It's just…

09:54.142 --> 09:57.645
Kirk, I just had a spat with my sourball distributor, and I'm not in the mood.

09:57.716 --> 09:58.536
Now, what's the trouble?

09:59.349 --> 10:01.654
- It's eggs. 
- What? What's eggs?

10:01.751 --> 10:05.176
In the square -- the smell. It's not skunks, it's eggs.

10:05.289 --> 10:07.906
- Easter eggs from the Easter egg hunt. 
- But Easter was over a week ago.

10:08.002 --> 10:12.667
And I did it just like you told me. I personally hid 300 eggs around the town square,

10:12.806 --> 10:16.651
and the kids had a blast hunting them down, except the Banyan boys.

10:16.712 --> 10:18.795
They're bad seeds. Going to hell -- both of them.

10:18.924 --> 10:22.517
But the kids only found 241 of them.

10:22.589 --> 10:26.886
Are you telling me that there are fifty-nine rotting eggs hidden in the square?

10:27.054 --> 10:30.537
I thought they would naturally decompose and just disappear.

10:30.633 --> 10:35.155
- Eggs smell when they decompose. 
- I just found that out.

10:38.442 --> 10:41.093
I find your hair very believable.

10:46.639 --> 10:48.712
Nice shot. Beautiful!

10:49.451 --> 10:51.384
You're being extremely charitable.

10:51.494 --> 10:53.331
Oh, Richard, if I get that far on four shots,

10:53.414 --> 10:55.522
it would be a miracle on the order of loaves and fishes.

10:55.625 --> 10:56.915
Yeah, and I'm in the sand.

10:57.331 --> 11:00.059
I don't think any of us are gonna make Tiger shake in his spikes.

11:01.825 --> 11:03.509
I'd go with a driver or 3-wood.

11:03.591 --> 11:05.563
Whatever is gonna make me look less like Dorf.

11:06.638 --> 11:10.458
You know, my wife's very excited about the merger, Richard -- very excited.

11:10.575 --> 11:14.195
Oh, do give Trish our best. Emily and I were just talking about her -- terrific girl.

11:17.523 --> 11:20.309
At least he held onto the club this time.

11:20.575 --> 11:24.092
Now, it's hard to know whether he should yell "fore!" Or "duck!"

11:25.177 --> 11:29.315
Why can't businessmen do deals over air hockey? I am great at air hockey.

11:30.880 --> 11:34.044
- Oh, looky here. 
- Hmm? Your father?

11:34.225 --> 11:36.179
One of the many hazards on this golf course.

11:36.324 --> 11:37.323
I thought that was you.

11:37.630 --> 11:40.548
Groundskeeper must be unhappy that you're here today.

11:40.866 --> 11:43.113
Divots -- I do produce a lot of divots. Good one.

11:43.260 --> 11:45.708
- Richard, nice to see you. 
- Same here, Floyd.

11:45.847 --> 11:48.673
And, Bob, didn't know you were a duffer.

11:48.874 --> 11:52.134
- More like spoiling a good walk. 
- You want to play through, Floyd?

11:52.289 --> 11:55.827
Actually, I was heading back to the clubhouse, and you caught my eye.

11:56.369 --> 11:57.905
- How's Emily? 
- She's fine.

11:58.566 --> 12:00.972
- Good health? 
- Very good. And Carol?

12:01.088 --> 12:05.662
Fine, fine. You know, she really misses Emily -- misses her company.

12:05.772 --> 12:07.008
And vice versa, I'm sure.

12:07.085 --> 12:08.969
You couldn't drag those two apart at a function.

12:09.066 --> 12:12.297
- They were like conjoined twins. 
- I know she'd love to see Emily again.

12:12.476 --> 12:13.853
I'm sure the feeling is mutual.

12:14.048 --> 12:15.826
Then, perhaps we should get those two together.

12:16.931 --> 12:18.119
Well, we could arrange that.

12:18.355 --> 12:20.771
- I can tell Carol to give her a call. 
- Any time.

12:20.899 --> 12:25.333
You know, if it's a meal, we men could tag along if they'd let us.

12:25.450 --> 12:27.365
That's a big "if," but that could happen.

12:27.644 --> 12:31.343
- Maybe Jason could tag along, too. 
- That would be a nice little gathering.

12:31.488 --> 12:33.990
I'm out of town next week, but this Friday's free.

12:34.430 --> 12:36.806
- Friday would be perfect. 
- I hope it happens.

12:36.893 --> 12:38.451
- I hope so, too. 
- Glad to run into you.

12:38.644 --> 12:40.724
- Same here, Floyd. 
- Bob, Jason.

12:44.221 --> 12:45.260
He wants to have dinner.

12:47.791 --> 12:50.170
- Was it Carol's idea or Floyd's? 
- It's hard to say.

12:50.284 --> 12:53.011
- This is very good, Richard. 
- It was public. The whole club saw.

12:53.120 --> 12:55.915
But did he say that Carol had wanted it or that he had wanted it?

12:56.115 --> 12:57.558
- What did you hear? 
- I was out of earshot.

12:57.676 --> 13:00.922
Rapprochement with Floyd Stiles. Never in my wildest dreams.

13:00.989 --> 13:02.709
And it came from him. Who saw this coming?

13:02.806 --> 13:05.187
Did he bring up Carol before or after he brought up the dinner?

13:05.294 --> 13:08.240
- I didn't have a tape recorder, Emily. 
- I'll offer to host it here.

13:08.321 --> 13:11.875
I've got the perfect menu. Friday, right? So it's Lorelai and Rory, too.

13:11.992 --> 13:14.480
Well, Friday was his suggestion. I wasn't in a position to counter.

13:14.587 --> 13:16.564
- No, of course not. That's fine. 
- And he saw us with Bob, too.

13:16.636 --> 13:18.842
- And still he made the offer. 
- Acquiring Bob was a great idea.

13:18.940 --> 13:22.749
There'll be seven of us. That's an unbalanced table, but that's okay. Oh, this is wonderful!

13:23.000 --> 13:24.357
Floyd wants peace.

13:24.797 --> 13:25.616
So it seems.

13:30.516 --> 13:31.709
- Dean. 
- Surprise.

13:32.005 --> 13:32.757
What are you doing here?

13:33.071 --> 13:35.708
- I come bearing gifts. 
- A bookcase?

13:36.342 --> 13:39.455
Yeah, the one from the inn. Do you see what's going on out there?

13:40.689 --> 13:42.354
Almost there, almost there.

13:44.945 --> 13:45.738
Thanks for the help.

13:47.770 --> 13:48.575
Should I give him a hand?

13:49.931 --> 13:52.246
If he doesn't work for his inebriation, he won't appreciate it.

13:52.398 --> 13:54.417
There's a big party on Friday night. It must be for that.

13:54.503 --> 13:55.835
Yeah? You going?

13:56.054 --> 13:59.131
I have two papers due, so I'll be in Stars Hollow avoiding the fray.

13:59.413 --> 14:00.489
I'll just have a brewski there.

14:01.820 --> 14:04.099
So, which way's your room?

14:04.447 --> 14:05.052
Thataway.

14:07.437 --> 14:08.737
So, where did this come from?

14:09.172 --> 14:11.872
Well, your mom had it made for the Dragonfly, but it didn't fit,

14:12.004 --> 14:14.201
so she thought you could use it here.

14:15.245 --> 14:16.531
- She didn't tell you? 
- Nope.

14:17.319 --> 14:18.701
- Small. 
- Yes.

14:19.873 --> 14:21.644
- There's no place to put this. 
- Yes again.

14:22.982 --> 14:24.005
What was your mom thinking?

14:24.103 --> 14:26.831
That I have books, and that's probably the extent of it.

14:27.564 --> 14:30.565
- Right. So, I guess I'll take it back. 
- I'm sorry you had to make the trip.

14:30.723 --> 14:34.036
No, it's okay. It's kind of nice seeing where you live.

14:36.677 --> 14:38.418
So, are you on your way back to school?

14:38.767 --> 14:40.471
Oh, no, I'm just off from work.

14:40.646 --> 14:44.680
- I'm actually gonna take a little break from that. 
- From what, school?

14:44.951 --> 14:47.113
Yeah, just for a semester or two, you know.

14:47.292 --> 14:50.015
A semester or two? But I thought it was going so well.

14:50.091 --> 14:53.609
It was. It's just that Lindsay and I really need some extra money right now,

14:53.696 --> 14:56.769
- and this job with Tom has been perfect. 
- Extra money for what?

14:56.896 --> 15:00.358
- What do you mean? For life, things. 
- What kind of things?

15:01.208 --> 15:05.535
Well, Lindsay's got her heart set on having a townhouse by the end of the year,

15:05.606 --> 15:07.833
and we're kind of cramped where we are, so I think it's a good idea.

15:08.054 --> 15:08.969
- You do? 
- Yeah.

15:09.369 --> 15:10.567
- I don't. 
- What?

15:10.695 --> 15:12.036
I think it's a horrible idea.

15:12.989 --> 15:15.304
- It's just temporary. 
- Maybe.

15:15.559 --> 15:18.340
A lot of people who drop out say that it's just temporary.

15:18.549 --> 15:21.088
- It usually doesn't work out that way. 
- I'm gonna go back.

15:21.237 --> 15:23.481
- I hope so. 
- Have some faith, will you?

15:23.587 --> 15:25.005
I just think this is a mistake.

15:25.160 --> 15:27.852
Rory, I'm married, remember? I have responsibilities.

15:27.924 --> 15:29.859
- You'll lose your momentum. 
- I need the money.

15:29.936 --> 15:32.670
- Can't the townhouse wait? 
- Jeez, lighten up.

15:32.768 --> 15:34.326
I just think this is a really bad idea.

15:34.458 --> 15:36.880
Graduating from college doesn't guarantee you a job anymore.

15:36.983 --> 15:39.122
- It's not like it was with our parents. 
- So you're not going back?

15:39.199 --> 15:41.954
- You're twisting my words. 
- And you're just gonna work in construction?

15:42.030 --> 15:45.465
- What, are you gonna get all elitist on me now? 
- We're friends, so I get to tell you what I think.

15:45.558 --> 15:47.134
- Fine. 
- You should go to school.

15:47.252 --> 15:50.043
Great. Now you've told me three times. I get it.

15:50.135 --> 15:51.732
You don't need to tell me again, okay?

15:56.720 --> 15:58.307
- You want me to take this now? 
- Yes...

15:59.070 --> 16:02.030
- No. Whatever you want. 
- I'll take it now.

16:03.366 --> 16:03.883
Fine.

16:09.417 --> 16:12.392
Attention, please! Everybody, if I may!

16:12.505 --> 16:13.990
Let's have some attention, people!

16:14.712 --> 16:19.114
We all know why we're here. There are fifty-nine rotting Easter eggs

16:19.216 --> 16:21.706
hidden throughout the square, and we've got to find them.

16:21.782 --> 16:24.138
I know what you're thinking -- what about the map,

16:24.306 --> 16:27.834
the careful, detailed map of where the eggs are hidden

16:28.002 --> 16:31.787
made each year to avoid catastrophes such as this?

16:31.869 --> 16:36.364
Well, a map was not made this year, good townsfolk.

16:36.518 --> 16:38.432
One was not made.

16:38.836 --> 16:42.345
Now, this work is going to be exhausting and, yes, disgusting,

16:42.431 --> 16:48.023
but as my way of thanking you, help yourself to lunch at Doose's market,

16:48.115 --> 16:52.258
where everything in our prepared-foods section will be discounted 5%,

16:52.339 --> 16:54.797
20% for our day-old sushi.

16:56.314 --> 16:59.124
Now, with the flower show due in three days,

16:59.210 --> 17:02.231
we have a clock on this, people, but when I look out

17:02.298 --> 17:06.869
at this fine group of volunteers, my heart races with pride.

17:07.054 --> 17:09.875
I see America,

17:10.464 --> 17:12.224
and I am proud.

17:12.789 --> 17:15.037
- Now, are there any questions? 
- What's with the toupee?

17:15.717 --> 17:18.249
- It's not a toupee. 
- And I'm blond and leggy.

17:18.349 --> 17:20.670
Are there any legitimate questions from anyone?

17:21.031 --> 17:22.855
- Yes, Joe? 
- I'm Jewish.

17:23.351 --> 17:25.056
Well, that's swell.

17:25.241 --> 17:29.126
- Is it okay for a Jew to hunt Easter eggs? 
- That's between you and your Rabbi.

17:29.265 --> 17:31.605
- Jackson, a question? 
- Toupee guy says what?

17:31.835 --> 17:32.255
What?

17:33.438 --> 17:36.658
- What are you laughing about? 
- Jackson said, "Toupee guy says what?"

17:37.017 --> 17:41.163
Inspiring your understandable response of "what?" Thus soliciting their childish laughter.

17:41.307 --> 17:42.936
It's infantile and a total clam.

17:43.033 --> 17:47.973
Please report every found egg to me, and I will keep the running total.

17:48.531 --> 17:50.810
Now, good luck, and let the hunt begin.

17:51.440 --> 17:52.931
We won't let you down, Taylor,

17:53.416 --> 17:56.950
because not only are we gonna find twenty eggs within the hour,

17:57.103 --> 18:00.504
but we're going on to find twenty-five... and then thirty...

18:00.601 --> 18:05.085
and then thirty-five... and then forty... and then forty-five

18:05.187 --> 18:10.738
and then fifty until we find all fifty-nine and take back the square!

18:14.675 --> 18:17.209
- Hurt your throat? 
- Very badly.

18:17.510 --> 18:19.866
- Found one! 
- Fifty-eight to go.

18:20.184 --> 18:21.469
Good job, Joe.

18:26.769 --> 18:29.384
Okay, dinner is ready when the cow moos.

18:31.257 --> 18:34.326
- How about here? 
- Not there.

18:34.387 --> 18:35.427
- Why not? 
- It's dark.

18:35.543 --> 18:38.196
Yeah, that's the point. It's a dark corner. The plant livens it up.

18:38.904 --> 18:40.255
- Plants need light. 
- They do?

18:40.383 --> 18:42.605
It's the "photo" part of photosynthesize.

18:42.692 --> 18:44.489
Oh, don't some plants just synthesize?

18:44.561 --> 18:46.137
They really need the photo part.

18:46.194 --> 18:47.806
None of the plants I ever had needed light.

18:47.904 --> 18:48.698
Any of them live?

18:49.087 --> 18:51.175
No. Whoa, insight!

18:51.504 --> 18:52.758
Poor thing doesn't stand a chance.

18:53.090 --> 18:56.234
- Hey, so, you ready for Friday? 
- Ohh, dinner with my parents?

18:56.321 --> 18:59.127
- You haven't seen them in a while. 
- Well, I've seen Mom occasionally,

18:59.191 --> 19:01.147
but Floyd and I really haven't spoken since the great schism,

19:01.217 --> 19:04.615
not that Harry Chapin isn't dying to rise from the grave and write a song about us.

19:04.985 --> 19:07.289
- I'm a little nervous. 
- Yeah, I get that.

19:07.575 --> 19:11.631
And he's gonna call me "Digger." Oh, he loves calling me "Digger."

19:11.964 --> 19:14.277
And he has hated every girl I have ever dated.

19:14.835 --> 19:16.788
- Really? 
- Yeah, mom, too.

19:16.847 --> 19:19.954
It's some sort of reverse Oedipal thing. And not just the ones I pick.

19:20.006 --> 19:22.987
They set me up with a girl they loved, and as soon as they found out I liked her,

19:23.059 --> 19:25.557
they turned on her viciously. She moved to Alaska.

19:25.628 --> 19:27.226
- Why are you telling me this? 
- Just a heads up.

19:27.278 --> 19:29.340
All it's gonna do is make me nervous, and it has.

19:29.402 --> 19:30.954
They don't know I'm going out with you, so it doesn't matter.

19:31.025 --> 19:32.163
Well, they'll find out eventually.

19:32.244 --> 19:35.500
Well, impress them now when they don't know. Preempt their gathering hatred.

19:35.546 --> 19:38.669
- Unless they end up hating me retroactively. 
- Oh, I have seen that, too.

19:38.731 --> 19:40.643
- Tony Robbins has nothing on you. 
- Sorry.

19:40.917 --> 19:43.421
- Ooh, how about here? 
- On the chair?

19:43.524 --> 19:45.106
Yeah, it's not a very comfortable chair.

19:45.182 --> 19:47.093
- How about I just get a new chair? 
- That'll work.

19:47.184 --> 19:50.680
You know, in a warped way, you being nervous has made me less nervous.

19:50.751 --> 19:52.504
- So there's a bright side. 
- Not that that was my intent.

19:52.560 --> 19:53.231
Good to know.

19:54.112 --> 19:54.742
Dinner.

19:57.594 --> 20:00.538
There was a death-to-disco movement in the late '70s -- very intense.

20:00.615 --> 20:03.282
- We had Donna Summer on the run. 
- "We?" You weren't born yet.

20:03.533 --> 20:05.202
- I'm a kindred spirit. 
- Gotcha.

20:05.325 --> 20:07.634
So where's the passion now, huh? Where is it?

20:07.706 --> 20:09.759
There's disco to kill anymore. They wiped it out.

20:09.826 --> 20:13.533
But there are other things that need wiping out -- phony rappers, most techno,

20:13.609 --> 20:16.992
alt country, Christian rock, anything fusion, classic alternative radio,

20:17.098 --> 20:20.132
where all they do is play the same Nirvana song over and over --

20:20.193 --> 20:21.683
the Rubens, the Clays, the Clarksons.

20:21.750 --> 20:23.997
It's gonna be a bloodbath. What are they doing?

20:24.372 --> 20:26.158
- You smell that smell? 
- Yeah.

20:26.301 --> 20:30.377
Taylor left Kirk in charge of the Easter egg hunt, and they didn't exactly find them all.

20:30.428 --> 20:32.768
- They lose the egg map? 
- They didn't make an egg map.

20:32.886 --> 20:35.041
- They didn't make an egg map? 
- I was just as shocked.

20:35.097 --> 20:36.378
They always make an egg map.

20:36.455 --> 20:38.840
- Let's have the hourly report, Joe. 
- Well, you know...

20:38.881 --> 20:41.140
- We found three more, Taylor. 
- I said, "Joe."

20:41.293 --> 20:45.307
- We found three more, Taylor. 
- That's not good! That is not good!

20:45.379 --> 20:50.150
More than half are still missing, and every minute we have people deserting the cause.

20:51.030 --> 20:53.832
- What's this? 
- There's a couple in the tree.

20:54.032 --> 20:56.714
- You hid them in a tree? 
- Oh, right.

20:56.831 --> 20:58.860
They're completely out of reach of the children.

20:59.141 --> 21:02.668
The others I hid for the delight of the children. These I hid for me.

21:03.136 --> 21:08.315
Get them down. This is not good. We are losing men, and we are losing...

21:08.411 --> 21:09.740
- Hair! 
- Time.

21:09.859 --> 21:14.032
- Jinx, jinx, jinx, jinx! 
- Oh, I miss the Caribbean.

21:14.926 --> 21:18.552
- So, what are we looking for? 
- Well, we still have no fridge, no stove,

21:18.619 --> 21:21.906
and no microwave, so nothing perishable, nothing that requires boiling water,

21:21.977 --> 21:24.973
- and nothing that needs to be cooked. 
- I'm guessing the day-old sushi is out.

21:25.105 --> 21:26.835
- It was never in. 
- Beef jerky?

21:26.918 --> 21:28.720
- Definitely. 
- And protein bars.

21:28.824 --> 21:31.695
- I'm sorry. When did I win the lottery? 
- Protein bars are a luxury?

21:31.746 --> 21:33.758
They are when you live with guys that eat ten of everything

21:33.804 --> 21:36.687
when one's the correct portion. Got to keep that proportion cost low.

21:36.760 --> 21:38.075
- Pretzels. 
- Perfect.

21:38.182 --> 21:40.788
- And, of course, the perennial Pop-tart. 
- Oh, load up on those.

21:41.167 --> 21:43.614
- Did I tell you that Dean stopped by? 
- Where, Yale?

21:43.803 --> 21:47.490
He was delivering a bookcase for my mom. Hey, you want a bookcase? It's free.

21:47.618 --> 21:49.857
I'll take it. So, how's old Dean-boy doing?

21:50.009 --> 21:51.879
- He dropped out of college. 
- What? You're kidding!

21:51.981 --> 21:53.839
Says he needs money. How about marshmallows?

21:53.956 --> 21:56.103
Sure, and throw in a Park Avenue mansion while you're at it.

21:56.180 --> 21:58.836
- Another luxury -- got it. 
- So, he's just working full-time?

21:59.010 --> 22:02.154
It's such a waste. Dean is so smart. He can do so much more.

22:02.383 --> 22:04.893
- Hey, melba toast. 
- Cheap, tasteless, and filling.

22:04.975 --> 22:05.811
I'll grab a bunch.

22:06.040 --> 22:08.990
And I'll get one bag of marshmallows so the boys can have a treat afterwards.

22:09.246 --> 22:12.517
I'm mad at Dean about doing this, but I'm more mad at Lindsay. She's so selfish.

22:12.686 --> 22:14.001
- Women. 
- She's his wife.

22:14.083 --> 22:17.018
She should be encouraging him to go to school and think about his future,

22:17.080 --> 22:20.061
but, no, she needs a townhouse and a Rolls-Royce.

22:20.163 --> 22:22.556
- They're buying a Rolls-Royce? 
- No, but they are the townhouse,

22:22.823 --> 22:25.855
and he didn't even seem that excited about it. It's just Lindsay.

22:26.204 --> 22:28.651
I mean, why doesn't she get a job. What does she do all day?

22:38.717 --> 22:39.346
So, you think...

22:40.258 --> 22:41.205
you think she heard?

22:53.584 --> 22:54.552
- Kirk? 
- That's me.

22:54.620 --> 22:56.094
- You want something? 
- Why?

22:56.509 --> 22:58.321
Well, you usually get something here. You're in the diner.

22:58.894 --> 22:59.600
Oh, yes.

23:01.541 --> 23:02.367
- Kirk? 
- That's me.

23:02.853 --> 23:04.261
- You want some coffee? 
- Yes, please.

23:04.983 --> 23:06.693
Your eyes are spinning in different directions.

23:06.876 --> 23:08.755
I've been up for one and a half days straight.

23:09.079 --> 23:11.899
I haven't done that since the "Petticoat Junction" marathon in '97.

23:12.135 --> 23:14.254
Right. Caught a little of that myself.

23:17.563 --> 23:22.115
Luke, turkey sandwich on rye, please -- lettuce, tomato, cucumber.

23:22.221 --> 23:22.876
Coming right up.

23:23.493 --> 23:24.474
We're gonna do it, Taylor!

23:25.175 --> 23:27.906
- We're gonna find those last twelve eggs! 
- Cole slaw, too.

23:28.008 --> 23:31.187
- Every last one of them! 
- And a pickle -- make it two.

23:31.601 --> 23:35.744
Joe and I can divide the square in two and sweep it clean till the job's done.

23:36.015 --> 23:39.640
I'm going to pay now and wait outside if you don't mind.

23:39.840 --> 23:40.582
I guess not.

23:41.088 --> 23:44.171
I'll take the east side, he'll take the west. That way we can --

23:44.284 --> 23:46.639
- That's enough, Kirk! 
- Hey, watch it.

23:46.746 --> 23:50.694
You're not satisfied that I'm suffering for what you've done to this town.

23:50.755 --> 23:53.187
You have to continue to personally torture me?

23:53.510 --> 23:56.371
- We'll find the twelve! 
- We won't find the twelve!

23:56.500 --> 23:59.720
You have brought disaster down upon us! Are you happy?!

24:00.135 --> 24:03.197
I left you in charge of things because I thought I could trust you,

24:03.253 --> 24:06.781
but you let me down. Now I have to cancel the flower show.

24:06.842 --> 24:09.951
I'm making the call tomorrow. The flower show is history.

24:10.022 --> 24:13.918
- But we're only missing twelve! 
- We have to find every last egg.

24:14.092 --> 24:17.758
- Well, then, Joe and I... 
- Joe just left for Cabala class.

24:17.851 --> 24:20.023
- I have no men left. 
- You have me left.

24:20.932 --> 24:23.457
I have no men left.

24:24.122 --> 24:26.498
I've lost my appetite.

24:33.891 --> 24:36.038
Hi, guys. Wow, love the heaters.

24:36.273 --> 24:38.510
It's not too cold, is it? We thought we'd start the evening out here.

24:38.592 --> 24:39.345
It's nice.

24:39.415 --> 24:42.007
No, no. I'm not seeing the olives that Floyd likes.

24:42.094 --> 24:45.089
They're in the back on the right. Is this cart in the best place?

24:45.283 --> 24:47.496
- Move it back? 
- Move it back.

24:47.960 --> 24:51.586
They keep moving everything back and forth -- the cart, the heater, me.

24:51.661 --> 24:53.107
- I used to be over there. 
- They're perfectionists.

24:53.271 --> 24:54.485
It's like watching an ant farm.

24:54.551 --> 24:58.033
Oh! I should go grab that gin that Floyd likes. I've got some in the freezer.

24:58.724 --> 25:00.255
Maybe it was better in the other spot.

25:00.837 --> 25:02.773
- Patio looks great, Mom, really. 
- I guess.

25:04.186 --> 25:06.031
Where's that awful light coming from?

25:06.802 --> 25:07.889
I think it's the moon?

25:08.062 --> 25:09.820
You're not thinking of having the moon moved, are you, Mom?

25:09.926 --> 25:11.929
I suppose it will move on its own at some point.

25:12.673 --> 25:14.534
- You look nice. 
- Thank you.

25:14.780 --> 25:15.738
Why do you look so nice?

25:15.856 --> 25:17.631
Because I knew this was an important night for you guys,

25:17.708 --> 25:19.031
I thought I would dress up a little.

25:19.322 --> 25:19.936
They're here.

25:20.946 --> 25:22.624
Richard, they're here!

25:23.233 --> 25:25.721
- You do look especially nice tonight. 
- What is with everyone?

25:25.829 --> 25:28.493
It's not like I'm always in dirty sweats fresh from slopping the pigs.

25:28.583 --> 25:31.139
You know what I mean. You don't have that just-came-from-work look about you.

25:31.175 --> 25:32.249
A girl can't dress up a little?

25:32.495 --> 25:34.922
- Your mom's a little nervous. 
- Ta-ta-ta-da.

25:35.020 --> 25:37.749
Oh, right. You're meeting the parents.

25:37.892 --> 25:41.419
I actually had not put that together before. That's why you showered.

25:41.527 --> 25:42.506
That's not why I showered.

25:42.992 --> 25:43.647
Here we are!

25:43.846 --> 25:47.067
Oh, your patio is beautiful, Emily!

25:47.139 --> 25:48.076
Thank you, Carol.

25:48.168 --> 25:49.265
- Hi, honey. 
- Hi, Mom.

25:49.448 --> 25:52.516
- Floyd, Carol, our daughter, Lorelai. 
- How do you do.

25:52.619 --> 25:53.534
And our granddaughter, Rory.

25:53.713 --> 25:57.594
- We've met before, but a long time ago. Hi. 
- We remember you well.

25:58.010 --> 26:00.201
You didn't dress up for our benefit, I hope.

26:00.287 --> 26:01.603
No, no. This is nothing weird.

26:01.757 --> 26:03.535
How 'bout some beverages, everybody?

26:03.707 --> 26:06.780
- Extra dry martini still your drink, Floyd? 
- Absolutely.

26:06.909 --> 26:07.702
Same here, Dad.

26:07.901 --> 26:10.533
And bourbon with a splash of branch water, right, Carol?

26:10.604 --> 26:12.427
- Thank you, Richard. 
- Oh, here, Emily.

26:13.022 --> 26:16.437
- You've redone the patio. It's gorgeous! 
- Don't you think?

26:16.712 --> 26:19.693
Oh, and those trees -- I love them. What are they?

26:19.774 --> 26:21.157
They're African. Come see.

26:21.802 --> 26:24.674
I'm trying to remember when we saw you last.

26:25.463 --> 26:29.329
- Ah, probably at camp. 
- Right, the day we came to pick up Jason.

26:29.508 --> 26:33.394
There was a talent show. You sang a duet with a pimply fellow.

26:33.470 --> 26:36.118
- "Crater Face" Cutler. 
- He's a litigator now. Very bitter man.

26:36.190 --> 26:39.742
Well, the pimply fellow stank, but you were wonderful -- very charming.

26:39.835 --> 26:42.103
- It was from "Grease." 
- How Crater Face got his pimples?

26:42.169 --> 26:46.634
No, my song -- "Summer Lovin'." I had to sit on his lap. It was very uncomfortable.

26:46.721 --> 26:48.012
Crater Face had very bony knees.

26:48.088 --> 26:50.791
And you did a dance with somebody, if I remember correctly.

26:50.905 --> 26:53.649
- Oh, yes, he cha-cha'd. 
- Well, thank you for bringing that up.

26:53.787 --> 26:55.343
And thank you for never sending me to camp.

26:55.460 --> 26:58.374
You were great. I liked when you and your partner knocked heads.

26:58.456 --> 27:01.477
"Clubfoot" Cindy -- she married "Crater Face" Cutler. Beautiful children.

27:01.549 --> 27:02.732
Here are your drinks everybody.

27:04.246 --> 27:07.498
- Rory, we left your soda inside. 
- Oh, I'll go get it.

27:08.011 --> 27:11.183
I actually had a barbershop quartet at Yale.

27:11.431 --> 27:14.365
I was by far the weakest link. That reminds me.

27:14.533 --> 27:18.122
I have a story I've been dying to tell you ever since I heard it, Richard,

27:18.338 --> 27:21.553
- about Herb Benson. 
- Oh, what's the rogue up to now?

27:21.634 --> 27:23.458
Later. I don't want to bore the others.

27:23.595 --> 27:26.248
I can't wait. Help me take the drinks down to the ladies?

27:26.347 --> 27:27.859
Absolutely. Excuse us.

27:29.085 --> 27:30.222
Alright, ladies?

27:34.001 --> 27:37.446
- Wow, look at that. 
- Groucho, Chico, Harpo, and Zeppo together again.

27:37.797 --> 27:39.956
- Excuse me, Grandma. 
- Yes, sweetie?

27:40.042 --> 27:42.079
Elsa said to say that dinner's in fifteen minutes.

27:42.274 --> 27:44.046
Did she ask you to do some vacuuming, too?

27:45.245 --> 27:47.528
She sends my granddaughter out to do her job.

27:47.800 --> 27:51.077
How many maids has Emily been through, Richard? We used to keep a running count.

27:51.194 --> 27:55.090
No, I'm afraid western mathematical principles cannot accommodate such a task.

27:55.618 --> 27:57.829
My father is in a particularly good mood tonight.

27:58.025 --> 27:58.588
Very.

27:58.829 --> 28:01.505
He's only said two passive-aggressive things to me since he got here,

28:01.562 --> 28:02.674
which is astounding for him.

28:02.858 --> 28:06.304
By the way, may I be the fourteenth person this evening to say how great you look?

28:06.374 --> 28:08.157
It's the shower. I gotta try that more often.

28:11.008 --> 28:13.604
Oh, this is our grandson's first step.

28:13.681 --> 28:15.591
We were so lucky to have the camera ready.

28:15.713 --> 28:19.016
- Oh, that's darling. 
- Oh, ho, ho. He's gonna be big.

28:19.164 --> 28:23.078
He's gonna start on the defensive line for the Bulldogs in 2021.

28:23.424 --> 28:25.044
Floyd has it all worked out.

28:25.278 --> 28:28.105
I believe that's you very lovingly holding your nephew,

28:28.238 --> 28:29.752
who looks very happy in your arms.

28:29.840 --> 28:33.061
I just told him I'd opened a no-load mutual fund for him. Tracks the S&P.

28:33.147 --> 28:34.750
You sentimental fool.

28:34.874 --> 28:37.531
You know, I have some terrific pictures of Rory. I should go get them.

28:37.633 --> 28:39.855
- But, Grandma, I'm right here. 
- I know, but you're so big now.

28:39.988 --> 28:41.508
Slouch down in your chair for Grandma, honey.

28:41.590 --> 28:43.710
You know, if it's okay, I actually thought I might leave soon.

28:43.813 --> 28:45.949
She's got a big paper due next week and lots of reading.

28:46.049 --> 28:48.175
Oh, yes, Rory. We've made you stay too long already.

28:48.298 --> 28:49.483
Oh, yes, go, go.

28:49.651 --> 28:52.163
Thank you for looking like you weren't too bored all evening.

28:52.338 --> 28:54.964
Oh, no, I wasn't, really. It was fun. Bye, Grandma.

28:55.779 --> 28:57.899
- You have to go, too? 
- Oh, no, we came separately.

28:58.078 --> 28:58.657
Good.

28:58.834 --> 29:00.346
- Bye, Grandpa. 
- Goodbye, Rory.

29:00.587 --> 29:02.425
- Lovely girl. 
- Oh, she's a doll.

29:02.640 --> 29:06.126
Well, I think this is the perfect time for those who are so inclined to enjoy a cigar.

29:06.316 --> 29:07.472
All right, let's fire 'em up!

29:07.612 --> 29:09.767
I meant the men, but would you like a cigar?

29:09.930 --> 29:13.218
No, you guys go. Circle the fire. Pound your chests. We'll be waiting.

29:13.489 --> 29:14.877
- Floyd, Jason. 
- Let's do it.

29:14.999 --> 29:17.683
Well, let's let Elsa clean up and maybe keep her job.

29:18.086 --> 29:20.043
- The living room all right? 
- We can bring the coffee?

29:20.145 --> 29:21.446
- I was going to pour brandy. 
- Even better.

29:21.521 --> 29:25.629
Oh, let's go. Oh, this evening has been so wonderful, Emily...

29:25.879 --> 29:28.208
- The two of us together again. 
- Yes, it has.

29:28.271 --> 29:31.162
All those horrible things that happed with the business.

29:31.405 --> 29:34.050
Now, let's not let business come between us again.

29:34.160 --> 29:36.703
All that ugliness is in the past now, so we don't have to worry.

29:37.159 --> 29:37.707
Yes.

29:38.644 --> 29:40.686
Smooth. '63?

29:41.122 --> 29:44.276
'65. You can't get a '63 to save your life.

29:44.562 --> 29:45.592
Still does the trick, though.

29:45.812 --> 29:49.867
Oh, good port was as caught up in that ridiculous cigar boom a few years ago, remember?

29:50.128 --> 29:51.106
Yes, yes.

29:51.209 --> 29:54.567
Amateurs -- babes in diapers talking big in those cigar clubs,

29:54.710 --> 29:56.599
smoking Churchills down to the ring.

29:56.738 --> 30:00.768
Tobacco farmers harvested their crop green just to keep up with the demand.

30:00.849 --> 30:03.680
If I remember correctly, you found a way to rectify the problem.

30:03.757 --> 30:06.727
I couldn't get Hennessy's to put my favorite cigars aside for me --

30:06.804 --> 30:09.220
this after twenty years of giving them my business.

30:09.401 --> 30:11.668
- Big mistake. 
- Love these kind of stories.

30:11.730 --> 30:14.130
So I bypassed the bastards. I found their supplier.

30:14.187 --> 30:16.686
I swooped in and bought all of my favorites in bulk --

30:16.829 --> 30:19.502
hundreds of boxes, cash on the barrel,

30:19.641 --> 30:22.344
- so now Hennessy's couldn't get them. 
- Hundreds of boxes?

30:22.406 --> 30:24.375
Oh, I couldn't have smoked them in three lifetimes,

30:24.514 --> 30:28.139
so I kindly offered to sell Hennessy's my excess supply.

30:28.420 --> 30:31.011
They leapt at it like dogs for a bone.

30:31.206 --> 30:33.981
And I made enough to pay for the boxes that I kept.

30:34.088 --> 30:36.218
You're creative, Richard. It's one of your many strengths.

30:36.295 --> 30:37.852
I'd say it's his main strength.

30:37.923 --> 30:40.074
Who ever said an insurance man can't be creative?

30:40.135 --> 30:42.085
It's one of the fallacies about what we do.

30:42.306 --> 30:46.551
People think it's dry, wooden, a bunch of automatons shuffling papers.

30:46.761 --> 30:49.480
On the contrary -- it breeds daily.

30:49.879 --> 30:51.820
It's life and death, what we do.

30:52.663 --> 30:56.659
It's a new drama every day -- almost Shakespearean.

30:56.745 --> 30:58.445
"Richard III," "Macbeth."

30:58.537 --> 31:00.989
What day doesn't necessitate courage, tenacity,

31:01.071 --> 31:04.456
and sometimes, like your cigar story, Richard, a little vengeance?

31:04.537 --> 31:07.374
- And that's all before lunch. 
- Our work is wonderful.

31:07.886 --> 31:09.279
I've always felt that way --

31:09.694 --> 31:12.796
protective of what I do, protective of what I have.

31:13.012 --> 31:15.289
- I think my cigar is out. 
- That's why I'm suing you.

31:16.314 --> 31:17.866
- Dad. 
- You're joking.

31:18.438 --> 31:20.958
I'm not joking. I'm suing your company.

31:21.352 --> 31:24.572
- My lawyers will be contacting you Monday morning. 
- Floyd, you're not serious.

31:24.638 --> 31:27.875
Richard, you didn't think I'd let Digger walk away with some of my oldest clients

31:27.967 --> 31:30.583
and not respond, did you? Are you that naive?

31:30.670 --> 31:31.720
Dad, this is crazy.

31:32.212 --> 31:34.919
You signed a noncompete clause with me, Digger.

31:34.993 --> 31:37.327
- And I didn't break that clause. 
- He didn't, Floyd.

31:37.434 --> 31:40.353
I studied Jason's contract, and only certain clients were off limits,

31:40.475 --> 31:43.429
- and those remained off limits. 
- Alexander Barnes was off limits.

31:43.512 --> 31:46.441
That was a social lunch, and you can't prove otherwise. You have no case.

31:46.527 --> 31:49.502
Maybe, maybe not. But by the time the courts figure out the situation,

31:49.564 --> 31:53.418
I'll have buried you in legal fees. I know your financial situation, Richard.

31:53.557 --> 31:55.722
You can't survive a lengthy legal process.

31:55.820 --> 31:57.402
So, this is just revenge, Floyd?

31:58.415 --> 31:59.762
Are we stooping that low?

31:59.869 --> 32:03.490
You just described how strongly you felt about a bunch of cigars.

32:03.803 --> 32:06.189
How did you think I was going to feel about my business?

32:06.315 --> 32:08.328
How did you know I had lunch with Alex, Dad?

32:08.687 --> 32:10.485
You have a private investigator tailing me?

32:10.587 --> 32:13.730
This whole business is so distasteful, but what was I to do?

32:13.895 --> 32:17.821
I did what I had to do -- what Richard Gilmore would do.

32:20.124 --> 32:21.437
I think I should go now.

32:21.957 --> 32:24.139
Don't -- Dad, don't leave. Call this off!

32:24.836 --> 32:28.496
Sorry I didn't get to that anecdote, Richard. Maybe some other time.

32:30.391 --> 32:30.949
Dad!

32:33.647 --> 32:36.888
Rory did come out and she was a beautiful debutante -- the hit of the night.

32:37.093 --> 32:40.114
She did so well, we had her go back in and come out again.

32:40.267 --> 32:43.231
- Floyd, wait. 
- Dad, I will block the door if I have to.

32:43.309 --> 32:46.206
- I wouldn't suggest you do that, son. 
- What is going on?

32:46.350 --> 32:48.644
- I should get my purse. 
- Carol, no.

32:49.160 --> 32:51.409
- Excuse us, Emily. This is rude, but we have to go. 
- Mom, stay.

32:51.517 --> 32:54.956
- It's too late, Jason. 
- What's going on? Richard?

32:55.054 --> 32:56.575
I apologize, for how this ended.

32:56.693 --> 32:59.349
We are not unprepared for a fight. We are capitalized.

32:59.415 --> 33:02.411
Only because you put your pension up as collateral on all your loans, Richard.

33:02.497 --> 33:05.274
- How did you... 
- It's a small community, our community.

33:05.427 --> 33:08.054
Endangering your pension, Richard -- it's reckless.

33:08.141 --> 33:10.301
Which PI did you have on me? Paluso, I assume?

33:10.378 --> 33:12.667
He's the best. He gets everything.

33:12.841 --> 33:16.568
- It's how I found out your daughter is dating my son. 
- That's not true.

33:22.769 --> 33:24.971
Sorry we spoiled your secret, son.

33:26.685 --> 33:29.191
We'll see ourselves out. Come on, Carol.

33:29.333 --> 33:30.183
Dad, wait!

33:30.900 --> 33:33.532
Richard, Emily, this isn't gonna happen, period.

33:34.070 --> 33:36.818
It will resolve quickly and in our favor. Excuse me. Dad!

33:56.043 --> 33:56.986
We need to talk.

34:05.250 --> 34:06.658
You brought your own car, didn't you?

34:08.400 --> 34:10.402
You don't need to stay. You can go.

34:11.605 --> 34:12.408
I'm blocked in.

34:22.054 --> 34:23.840
Richard, you have every right to be angry.

34:23.943 --> 34:28.043
Oh, you're damn right I do. To be humiliated like this in my own house?!

34:28.120 --> 34:30.266
- It was unconscionable. 
- Why didn't you see this coming?

34:30.327 --> 34:32.304
You know him, Richard. He doesn't show his hand.

34:32.420 --> 34:34.732
He sweet-talked us on the golf course, got himself invited to dinner.

34:34.797 --> 34:37.706
- The man is a sociopath! 
- Tell me if you've done anything -- anything illegal.

34:37.818 --> 34:40.501
Nothing, Richard, I swear to you -- nothing.

34:40.598 --> 34:42.533
- The lunch with Alex? 
- Social -- we're friends.

34:42.616 --> 34:44.485
- Why should I believe you? 
- Because I'm not stupid enough

34:44.521 --> 34:47.275
to do anything illegal or think that I could get anything illegal by you.

34:47.357 --> 34:51.110
I do push boundaries, Richard, but I never cross them -- ever.

34:51.268 --> 34:53.112
How long have you been seeing my daughter?

34:54.315 --> 34:58.222
- Five months. 
- For five months you've been lying to me.

34:58.283 --> 35:02.256
Yes, but it was a white lie. It was a timing issue.

35:02.369 --> 35:05.036
It would have complicated our relationship, yours and mine,

35:05.110 --> 35:08.237
and we didn't know if it would last, so we took a path.

35:08.339 --> 35:10.562
It was the wrong path, and I am sorry about that, too.

35:10.628 --> 35:12.574
- You've got a lot to be sorry about. 
- I do.

35:14.975 --> 35:16.162
My damned father.

35:17.965 --> 35:21.994
I should have seen this coming. As well as I know him, I keep underestimating him.

35:23.946 --> 35:25.265
We both should have seen this coming.

35:26.557 --> 35:28.787
- I can make this go away. 
- How?

35:28.897 --> 35:31.483
It's a bluff. You know my father.

35:31.589 --> 35:34.615
He hates giving money to lawyers, and this action is gonna cost him big.

35:34.722 --> 35:36.428
- That is true. 
- So we will counter sue.

35:36.519 --> 35:39.275
- It's a wrongful lawsuit. We will make him pay. 
- Possibly.

35:39.386 --> 35:43.110
And I will do anything to win back your trust, Richard.

35:43.167 --> 35:46.581
You have been so good to me. Please... let me try.

35:50.609 --> 35:52.234
You've got my trust.

35:53.503 --> 35:54.226
Go get him.

35:55.884 --> 35:56.544
Thank you, Richard.

35:57.465 --> 36:00.052
Thank you. And also, I'm gonna work on my golf game --

36:00.138 --> 36:02.790
get it up to snuff so I stop embarrassing you around the greens.

36:03.549 --> 36:04.399
Yeah, do that.

36:05.899 --> 36:06.708
Thank you, Richard.

36:23.497 --> 36:27.315
I have a gigantic bottle of vodka at my place -- the largest bottle of vodka known to man.

36:27.414 --> 36:28.690
- But what will you drink? 
- Gin.

36:28.800 --> 36:29.451
Let's go.

36:38.483 --> 36:39.271
Eggs.

36:41.862 --> 36:43.004
Gotta get the eggs.

36:47.016 --> 36:47.709
Eggs.

37:06.198 --> 37:10.345
Flower show's tomorrow. Flower show's tomorrow, and I can't find the last twelve eggs.

37:10.857 --> 37:12.291
I let Taylor down.

37:13.202 --> 37:14.657
He's like a father to me.

37:15.322 --> 37:17.416
- I think he is my father. 
- He's not your father.

37:17.529 --> 37:18.824
No, my father's my father,

37:19.325 --> 37:20.939
which means Taylor's my tailor.

37:21.220 --> 37:23.754
- I wonder how much he charges to hem pants. 
- He's not your tailor.

37:23.847 --> 37:26.601
I let him down! I let Taylor down.

37:27.225 --> 37:28.783
I let the whole town down.

37:30.057 --> 37:31.522
He won't like me anymore.

37:37.450 --> 37:39.329
- What's this? 
- It's the last twelve eggs.

37:39.513 --> 37:41.767
- The last... 
- You picked some screwy places to hide them.

37:42.105 --> 37:44.034
- Don't do that again. 
- The last twelve?

37:44.116 --> 37:46.236
Tell Taylor you found them. Be the hero.

37:48.234 --> 37:50.219
Thank you. Thank you!

37:51.905 --> 37:54.572
I love you, Luke Danes! I love you!

37:55.202 --> 37:55.913
I'm stupid.

37:56.210 --> 37:59.442
I love you! I love Luke Danes!

38:00.629 --> 38:02.257
Love, love!

38:13.194 --> 38:15.139
- Hey. Come on. 
- What? Where?

38:15.318 --> 38:16.593
I want to talk to you. Come on.

38:28.175 --> 38:29.845
I've been trying to call your cell.

38:29.916 --> 38:32.782
- I didn't have it on. 
- I'm sorry, okay? I'm really sorry.

38:32.997 --> 38:36.039
- About what? 
- I was a jerk at your dorm. I yelled.

38:36.126 --> 38:38.365
- You didn't yell. 
- I got upset, and I shouldn't have.

38:38.461 --> 38:41.483
No, Dean, I'm the jerk. Hounding you about school like that --

38:41.584 --> 38:44.478
it all came out wrong. It's your life. It's your decision.

38:44.560 --> 38:47.124
- No, I shouldn't have sniped like that. 
- I deserved it.

38:47.427 --> 38:50.698
- You were concerned. 
- I want the best for you, and I think school is it.

38:50.877 --> 38:55.383
I still think that, but it's not up to me. I just don't want you to settle.

38:55.700 --> 38:56.806
Yeah, I know you don't.

38:58.547 --> 39:00.825
Sometimes it seems like you're the only one who doesn't.

39:04.088 --> 39:07.573
I think Lindsay may have overheard me saying stuff at Doose's.

39:09.402 --> 39:11.685
I feel even worse about that. I've got such a big mouth.

39:11.864 --> 39:12.899
No, it's okay.

39:13.220 --> 39:16.036
- She must have been really upset. 
- Kind of.

39:16.316 --> 39:18.761
- I didn't mean to hurt her feelings. 
- She'll be okay.

39:18.868 --> 39:21.090
She knows we talk, right -- that we're friends?

39:22.698 --> 39:23.625
She does now.

39:26.687 --> 39:29.010
She doesn't want me talking to you anymore.

39:32.251 --> 39:35.314
Well, I guess that's understandable.

39:37.506 --> 39:39.655
- I don't want that to happen. 
- I don't want that to happen either.

39:39.748 --> 39:40.885
Then it's not gonna happen.

39:45.328 --> 39:46.209
Should you get home?

39:49.256 --> 39:51.060
- Yeah. 
- Me too.

40:12.076 --> 40:12.761
Is it true?

40:13.708 --> 40:15.573
Did you put your pension up as collateral?

40:17.954 --> 40:18.798
Are we in trouble?

40:19.603 --> 40:20.601
It's going to work out, Emily.

40:21.528 --> 40:22.397
It'll be okay.

40:23.812 --> 40:25.173
You and Jason talked?

40:26.084 --> 40:27.554
It's going to be okay.

40:38.213 --> 40:42.171
Three words. Four words. Two words. Okay, you suck at charades.

40:42.739 --> 40:45.013
- We're playing charades? 
- Yeah, weren't we?

40:45.458 --> 40:46.585
- You're drunk. 
- You're drunk.

40:46.712 --> 40:49.017
- Don't drunk and drive. 
- I would not thunk it.

40:49.227 --> 40:50.707
- That's a fun game to play. 
- What?

40:51.024 --> 40:53.330
The "changing words into funny words" game.

40:54.343 --> 40:55.775
Oh, I'm sleepy.

40:57.149 --> 41:00.244
Hey, you know, your father was terrific until the end.

41:00.978 --> 41:03.490
Yeah, the end was kind of bad.

41:04.243 --> 41:06.619
It's like falling 600 feet to your death.

41:06.702 --> 41:10.848
You know, it's fun the first 599 feet, but it's just the last foot -- total sucko.

41:11.078 --> 41:13.613
Yeah, it's a bummer -- that last foot.

41:13.742 --> 41:15.988
But, you know, there is a bright side to this evening.

41:16.081 --> 41:16.844
The moon?

41:17.111 --> 41:19.752
No, but the moon was very bright.

41:20.588 --> 41:23.863
At least our relationship is out in the open -- no more hiding.

41:24.023 --> 41:25.749
Yeah, no more hiding. I'll drink to that.

41:26.936 --> 41:31.282
And I got Richard calm, and I'll work my magic, which is what I do.

41:31.821 --> 41:34.928
Dad's head looked like it was gonna go full-out piñata.

41:35.117 --> 41:37.427
It'll be okay. He and I are going golfing in a couple days.

41:37.492 --> 41:38.654
That always puts him a good mood.

41:40.826 --> 41:44.876
Your plant is dead. How did it die so quickly?

41:45.010 --> 41:47.985
- It may have been self-inflicted. 
- Poor thing.

41:49.048 --> 41:51.660
Are you okay, though? Am I being enough supportive?

41:52.362 --> 41:54.343
- Reversed those last two words. 
- No, I'm fine.

41:54.728 --> 41:57.315
In a weird way, my father trying to destroy me is the first time

41:57.458 --> 42:00.717
- I've ever gotten any real respect out of him. 
- Cool. Clink.

42:12.929 --> 42:14.450
Nice shot! Beautiful!

42:14.849 --> 42:16.457
Your charity is limitless

42:16.601 --> 42:18.914
You're just warming up. You've always been a closer.

42:19.252 --> 42:22.063
Too true. So, we're done with the broad strokes?

42:22.197 --> 42:24.686
I believe so. I'll drop the lawsuit.

42:24.798 --> 42:26.139
We'll split the clients evenly.

42:26.329 --> 42:30.062
You'll come back to the firm -- have your own company under our umbrella.

42:30.194 --> 42:32.687
- And Jason is out. 
- Jason's out.

42:33.362 --> 42:36.887
- You'll be returning a hero, Richard. 
- Music to my ears.

42:37.238 --> 42:39.830
- Beautiful day today. 
- Beautiful.
