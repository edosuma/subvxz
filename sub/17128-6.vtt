I DIDN´T GO TO VEGAS.

01:59.790 --> 02:03.494
YOU KNOW YOU´RE NOT SUPPOSED

02:03.494 --> 02:05.256
HOW MUCH DID YOU LOSE

HE WENT TO VEGAS WITH A WOMAN.

02:09.730 --> 02:12.333
GEORGE.

02:12.333 --> 02:14.765
LOOK, PAYING SOME BIMBO
TO WATCH YOU GAMBLE

02:14.765 --> 02:17.238
DOESN´T QUALIFY YOU
AS BEING WITH A WOMAN.

02:17.238 --> 02:18.769
HEY, SHE WASN´T A BIMBO.

02:18.769 --> 02:21.672

COULD YOU SLIDE OUT? I NEED
TO USE THE RESTROOM.

02:31.622 --> 02:34.785
YOU NEVER COULD GET ANYTHING
ON YOUR OWN, COULD YOU, MEL?

02:34.785 --> 02:37.528
EVEN AS A LITTLE KID,
YOU HAD TO LICK MY PLATE

02:37.528 --> 02:39.590
WHEN I WAS DONE WITH IT.

02:39.590 --> 02:41.862
WHO SAID YOU WERE
DONE WITH IT?

02:41.862 --> 02:45.796
YOU SLEPT WITH MY WIFE
WHILE WE WERE STILL MARRIED?

02:45.796 --> 02:48.899
SERIOUSLY, GUYS, I´VE GOT
THE BLADDER OF A TODDLER.

02:50.801 --> 02:52.573

YOU KNOW, WHEN I LOOK AT YOU,
MEL, I DON´T SEE A BROTHER.

02:55.706 --> 02:58.309
I SEE A WORTHLESS

02:58.309 --> 03:00.681
OH, YEAH?

WELL, YOU WOULDN´T RECOGNIZE
THAT, WOULD YOU,

BECAUSE THAT´S THE FACE
JANET MAKES

03:07.588 --> 03:10.321
WHEN SHE´S BEEN SATISFIED.

03:11.462 --> 03:13.324

04:18.489 --> 04:20.761
WHAT DID YOU DO?
WHAT DID YOU DO?

04:20.761 --> 04:22.593
I SHOT MY MOUTH OFF,

04:22.593 --> 04:25.296
AND I GOT THE POWERS BROTHERS
IN A FISTFIGHT.

04:25.296 --> 04:26.737
WHAT?

04:26.737 --> 04:28.939
IT WAS UGLY, ANGIE.
I MEAN, ONE MINUTE,

THEY´RE TOASTING THE NEW
CONTRACT, ALL HAPPY,

04:31.302 --> 04:33.474
AND THE NEXT THING I KNOW,
THEY´RE ROLLING AROUND

04:33.474 --> 04:35.776

BITING EACH OTHER.

04:35.776 --> 04:40.351
JACK´S POWERFUL, BUT MEL´S
GOT THOSE POINTY TEETH.

04:40.351 --> 04:42.413
WHAT WERE THEY
FIGHTING ABOUT?

04:42.413 --> 04:44.885
I LET IT SLIP
THAT MEL WENT TO VEGAS.

04:44.885 --> 04:48.659
BUT HE WENT THERE TO...
[ Whistles ]

04:48.659 --> 04:50.621

04:50.621 --> 04:52.793

05:05.075 --> 05:07.678
OH, I HAD THE GREATEST TIME
WITH CLAIRE´S FAMILY.

05:07.678 --> 05:09.510
WE WENT TO THIS REALLY
FANCY RESTAURANT,

05:09.510 --> 05:12.413
AND THEY TOLD ME I COULD ORDER
WHATEVER I WANTED.

05:12.413 --> 05:15.546
I ATE ESCARGOTS.
THAT´S SNAILS.

05:15.546 --> 05:18.048
YOU KNOW, IF YOU WANT ESCARGOTS,
YOU CAN PUT YOUR MOUTH

05:18.048 --> 05:21.392
IN THE RAIN GUTTER
AND SAVE SOME CASH.

05:25.696 --> 05:27.928
CARMEN, GIVE US
A MINUTE, OKAY?

05:27.928 --> 05:29.560

05:29.560 --> 05:31.402
OH, HEY, BY THE WAY,
CLAIRE´S FAMILY INVITED ME

05:31.402 --> 05:33.604
TO GO SKIING WITH THEM NEXT
WEEKEND. I CAN GO, RIGHT?

05:33.604 --> 05:36.367
CARMEN, WE´RE LATINO.
WE DON´T SKI.

05:38.409 --> 05:42.072
IF WE´RE GOING DOWN A MOUNTAIN,
IT´S USUALLY BECAUSE

05:42.072 --> 05:46.116
WE CAN SEE SAN DIEGO
IN THE DISTANCE.

05:49.850 --> 05:53.053
BUT THEY HAVE A HOUSE
IN VAIL.

05:53.053 --> 05:54.955
I ONLY NEED MONEY
FOR SKI STUFF.

05:54.955 --> 05:58.128

06:06.997 --> 06:09.770
YOU´RE STILL $480 SHORT.

06:09.770 --> 06:11.702
MOM.

06:11.702 --> 06:14.775
CARMEN, JUST BECAUSE
YOU´RE AT ALLENDALE

06:14.775 --> 06:17.678
DOESN´T MEAN YOU´RE GOING
TO BE ABLE TO DO EVERYTHING

06:17.678 --> 06:19.009
YOUR RICH FRIENDS CAN.

06:19.009 --> 06:20.711
FOR EXAMPLE, THOSE TEETH --

06:20.711 --> 06:23.884
THAT´S AS WHITE
AS THEY´RE GOING TO GET.

06:23.884 --> 06:25.456

HEY, JACK, LISTEN, ABOUT
WHAT HAPPENED YESTERDAY --

07:06.126 --> 07:08.729
SAVE IT, GEORGE. WHATEVER
YOU´RE GOING TO SAY,

07:08.729 --> 07:11.632
IT´S NOT GOING
TO CHANGE MY MIND.

07:11.632 --> 07:14.465
ALL RIGHT, MOST OF YOU SAW
MY BROTHER AND I GOT

07:19.209 --> 07:23.674
EXCEPT THAT THERE WILL BE
ONE SMALL CHANGE IN MANAGEMENT.

07:23.674 --> 07:25.676
HE´S GOING TO REGRET THIS.

07:25.676 --> 07:30.120
I KNOW HOW THEY´RE CUTTING
CORNERS IN THE HEALTH PLAN.

07:30.120 --> 07:31.952
MEL´S OUT.

07:31.952 --> 07:34.084
WE´RE SPLITTING THE COMPANY
IN TWO.

07:34.084 --> 07:35.956
FORGET WHAT I SAID.

07:35.956 --> 07:39.560
JUST DRINK SOME TEQUILA
AND CUT YOUR OWN MOLES OFF.

07:41.231 --> 07:45.566
MEL IS STARTING A NEW COMPANY
WITH THE DESIGN TEAM,

07:45.566 --> 07:48.038
AND I´M KEEPING THIS PLANT
AND MANUFACTURING.

07:48.038 --> 07:50.941

ARE YOU SURE?

08:08.559 --> 08:10.861
I MEAN, IS IT WORTH LOSING
THE DEFENSE CONTRACT

08:10.861 --> 08:12.863
JUST BECAUSE MEL SLEPT
WITH YOUR WIFE?

08:12.863 --> 08:15.095

CAN I GET THE DAY OFF
TO BE BURIED?

LET´S SEE
HOW THAT WEEK´S GOING.

08:29.940 --> 08:32.813
OH, MEL, I´M SO SORRY.

THROUGH THAT WINDOW?

08:37.287 --> 08:39.650
I SEE THE PAST.

08:39.650 --> 08:42.292
I SEE PEOPLE TOILING AWAY
AT DEAD-END JOBS --

08:42.292 --> 08:44.925
NO HOPES, NO DREAMS,
NOTHING.

08:44.925 --> 08:46.997
JUST A BUNCH OF ZOMBIES.

08:46.997 --> 08:50.731
AT THE CHRISTMAS PARTY,
YOU SAID WE WERE FAMILY.

08:50.731 --> 08:53.764
YEAH, I KNOW. I WAS SO DRUNK
I WOKE UP THE NEXT MORNING,

08:53.764 --> 08:56.767
I THOUGHT I´D CUT A WOMAN
IN HALF.

08:56.767 --> 09:00.641
TURNS OUT I HAD TOOK HOME

THAT JACK HAD.

09:14.755 --> 09:16.987
YOU´RE NOT GOING TO HIT
ON MY WIFE, ARE YOU?

09:16.987 --> 09:19.630
WHAT AM I SAYING?
SHE´S DISGUSTED BY YOU.

09:19.630 --> 09:21.892
NO, I´M SERIOUS, GEORGE.

09:21.892 --> 09:24.735
I NEED SOMEBODY WHO KNOWS
ABOUT MANUFACTURING

TO STAY HERE.

09:38.078 --> 09:40.711
IT´S YOUR CALL.

09:40.711 --> 09:43.053
YOU CAN STAY HERE
AND PLAY NICKEL SLOTS

09:43.053 --> 09:44.685
FOR THE NEXT 20 YEARS,

09:44.685 --> 09:47.057
OR YOU CAN THROW YOUR DICE
WITH A HIGH ROLLER.

09:47.057 --> 09:48.819
THINK ABOUT IT.

09:48.819 --> 09:50.260
I WILL.

09:50.260 --> 09:54.094
BY THE WAY, JACK LIKES
TO TUCK IT AND DANCE NAKED.

10:17.848 --> 10:20.891
GEORGE...

10:20.891 --> 10:22.893
COME TO BED.

10:22.893 --> 10:24.895

I SAY WE MAKE
A PRO AND CON LIST, HMM?

10:36.066 --> 10:37.267
NO!

10:37.267 --> 10:39.109
PRO AND CON LISTS
DON´T WORK.

10:39.109 --> 10:41.912
THE LAST TIME WE MADE ONE,
WE ENDED UP HAVING CARMEN.

10:43.774 --> 10:47.147
GEORGE, GEORGE, LISTEN,
WE GOT TO TALK.

10:47.147 --> 10:48.679

11:07.938 --> 11:10.941
YOU CAN´T GO WITH MEL.
IT´S TOO CHANCY.

11:10.941 --> 11:13.403
WHAT IF THINGS
DON´T WORK OUT?

11:13.403 --> 11:16.676
WELL, HOW ARE YOU GOING
TO SUPPORT YOUR FAMILY?

11:16.676 --> 11:18.108
AW, YOU JUST WANT ME

WELL, YEAH.

11:24.985 --> 11:26.717
THAT´S PART OF IT.

11:26.717 --> 11:28.889
BUT, YOU KNOW,
I ALSO THINK

11:28.889 --> 11:30.220
THAT THE FACTORY
SHOULD HAVE

11:30.220 --> 11:32.462
THE BEST DAMN MANAGER
IT CAN,

AND YOU ARE

THEY ARE GOING TO PHASE ME OUT.

11:54.945 --> 11:57.818
A LOT OF THOSE PEOPLE
OVER THERE DON´T LIKE ME.

11:57.818 --> 11:59.850
NO.

11:59.850 --> 12:04.955
THEY CONFUSE MY SENSE OF HUMOR
WITH CRUELTY.

12:09.760 --> 12:12.963
I´M NOT GOING TO STAY THERE
JUST TO COVER YOUR BUTT.

12:12.963 --> 12:14.965
OH, COME ON.
WHO ARE YOU KIDDING?
