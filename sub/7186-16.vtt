00:31.832 --> 00:34.800

<i>We need some volunteers ¶</i>

00:34.802 --> 00:36.468
-  <i>Jake!</i>
<i>- Ahoy!</i>

00:36.470 --> 00:38.137
-  <i>Izzy!</i>
<i>- Ahoy!</i>

00:38.139 --> 00:39.538

Yo-ho, let's go!

01:00.661 --> 01:02.227
Ha-har!

01:03.329 --> 01:04.997
Ahoy, mateys!

01:04.999 --> 01:07.733
Do you want to join
my pirate crew?

01:09.102 --> 01:10.169
Great!

01:10.171 --> 01:11.737
To start today's adventure,

01:11.739 --> 01:14.440
everybody say
the Pirate Password.

01:14.442 --> 01:16.341
Yo-ho-ho!

01:16.343 --> 01:18.343
[all] Yo-ho-ho!

01:18.345 --> 01:19.745
One more time.

01:19.747 --> 01:21.814
[all] Yo-ho-ho!

01:25.051 --> 01:28.220
<i>[Skully] Sail Away Treasure.</i>

01:28.222 --> 01:31.390
[Skully] Crashin' crackers!
This place is perfect...

01:31.392 --> 01:33.392
...if you're a shipwreck!

01:33.394 --> 01:36.295
[Cubby] That's why it's called
Shipwreck Beach, Skully!

01:36.297 --> 01:38.697
Mateys, check out
that wreck.

01:38.699 --> 01:41.900
[Skully] Hey!
It's just my size... small!

01:41.902 --> 01:44.269
And look, there's
a bird figurehead!

01:44.271 --> 01:46.305
I've always wanted my own ship.

01:46.307 --> 01:48.307
Too bad that one's a wreck!

01:48.309 --> 01:50.309
It looks like it could
have been made for you.

01:50.311 --> 01:52.578
Hey, let's fix it up!

01:52.580 --> 01:54.313
And you can
sail it, Skully.

01:54.315 --> 01:56.915
I could?
That'd be great!

01:56.917 --> 01:59.885
- Woo-hoo!
- Oh, how exciting.

01:59.887 --> 02:01.320
[all] Captain Hook!

02:01.322 --> 02:03.755
Keep your hooks
off my ship, Hook!

02:03.757 --> 02:07.960
Relax, bird.
I'm not lookin'
for shipwrecks.

02:07.962 --> 02:10.295
I want treasure!

02:10.297 --> 02:13.765
You sea pups haven't
by chance seen any
treasure, have you?

02:13.767 --> 02:17.503
[Izzy] Sorry, Mr. Smee,
but there's no treasure
around here.

02:17.505 --> 02:21.173
Except for this shipwreck.
We're going to fix it up
so it can sail again.

02:21.175 --> 02:24.409
I'm going to call it
the "Leaky Beak"!

02:24.411 --> 02:29.948
[chuckles]
That pitiful pile of planks
will never be a ship...

02:29.950 --> 02:32.151
It's barnacle bait!

02:32.153 --> 02:36.121
Sail on, lads,
let us find real treasure!

02:36.123 --> 02:39.525
Don't listen to Hook, Skully.
This may not be treasure to him,

02:39.527 --> 02:40.959
but if we work together,

02:40.961 --> 02:43.095
this ship will
be as good as new!

02:43.097 --> 02:46.865
Mateys, will you help us fix
up the Leaky Beak for Skully?

02:48.601 --> 02:49.935
Great!

02:49.937 --> 02:52.104
Keep a look out
for gold doubloons.

02:52.106 --> 02:55.207
Whenever we solve a
pirate problem together,
they'll appear.

02:55.209 --> 02:58.710
Then we'll collect 'em
and put 'em in our
Team Treasure Chest.

02:58.712 --> 03:00.646
Is everybody ready?

03:00.648 --> 03:03.615
- I've got my sword.
- I got my map!

03:03.617 --> 03:06.051
And I've got my pixie dust.

03:06.053 --> 03:09.454
The fairies gave it to me
so that we can use it to fly.

03:09.456 --> 03:11.323
But only in emergencies.

03:11.325 --> 03:15.194
Yo-ho, let's go
fix up the Leaky Beak!

03:18.565 --> 03:21.133
<i>¶ Yo-ho, mateys away </i>

03:21.135 --> 03:24.303
<i>¶ There'll be treasure</i>
<i>and adventure today ¶</i>

03:24.305 --> 03:25.504
<i>¶ Let's go </i>

03:25.506 --> 03:28.840
<i>¶ Heave ho, here we go</i>
<i>Together as a team ¶</i>

03:28.842 --> 03:31.677
<i>¶ Jake and the</i>
<i>Never Land Pirates ¶</i>

03:31.679 --> 03:33.812
<i>¶ And me </i>

03:35.982 --> 03:39.651
The Leaky Beak is shipshape.
Let's take her out!

03:39.653 --> 03:42.354
Hold on, we have to
check the sail first.

03:42.356 --> 03:44.223
Let's hoist it!

03:44.225 --> 03:48.927
Awesome! That's not just a
sail... it's a treasure map!

03:48.929 --> 03:52.331
Hmmm... maybe this ship
was on a treasure hunt

03:52.333 --> 03:54.533
and never found the treasure!

03:54.535 --> 03:56.401
Hey, if Cubby's right,

03:56.403 --> 03:59.738
I bet the treasure
was meant for someone
on Skybird Island!

03:59.740 --> 04:04.276
Then let's go find the treasure
on Never Ever Peak Mountain...

04:04.278 --> 04:07.079
[Skully] ...and bring
it to Skybird Island!

04:07.081 --> 04:09.081
Yo-ho, let's go!

04:09.083 --> 04:11.216
[all] Aye-aye, Captain Skully!

04:11.218 --> 04:14.419
[Hook] Aye-aye
don't think so!

04:14.421 --> 04:16.088
[Skully]
Now what do you want?

04:16.090 --> 04:18.257
I want that map!

04:18.259 --> 04:21.226
It leads to what
is most dear to me...

04:21.228 --> 04:24.696
Treasure! So hand over the ship!

04:24.698 --> 04:27.232
If Old Feather Hat
wants the Leaky Beak,

04:27.234 --> 04:29.301
he has to catch it first!

04:30.770 --> 04:34.039
[Skully] The Leaky Beak
has wings! Woo-hoo!

04:35.541 --> 04:38.143
[Skully] This ship
really is for the birds!

04:38.145 --> 04:40.279
- Flying coconuts!
- Whoa!

04:40.281 --> 04:44.149
Yo-ho! We made the
Leaky Beak fly away from Hook

04:44.151 --> 04:46.918
and we got two gold doubloons!

04:46.920 --> 04:49.921
Let's grab 'em and go, go, go!

04:49.923 --> 04:53.825
Fancy that! A flyin' birdy-boat!

04:53.827 --> 04:56.828
Now I really want that ship!

04:56.830 --> 04:58.630
Hop on, Smee.

04:58.632 --> 05:00.299
- [Smee screaming]
- Luck be with ya, sir!

05:00.301 --> 05:02.701
Fly like a birdie!

05:05.171 --> 05:08.173
[Skully] Never Ever Peak,
here comes the Leaky Beak!

05:08.175 --> 05:11.677
The treasure chest
we're looking for is
around here somewhere.

05:11.679 --> 05:16.915
Cold crackers! All I see
is snow, but no treasure!

05:16.917 --> 05:18.116
[yells]

05:18.118 --> 05:21.353
Skully, I think you
landed on more than
just snow!

05:21.355 --> 05:25.090
Whoa! It's a treasure chest!

05:25.092 --> 05:28.994
And it's got a feather on it,
just like the map on our sail!

05:28.996 --> 05:31.029
Let's see what's inside.

05:31.031 --> 05:34.833
Shiver me timbers!
It's locked up tight.

05:34.835 --> 05:37.869
I think we should follow
the map to Skybird Island.

05:37.871 --> 05:39.971
Maybe somebody there
has the key.

05:39.973 --> 05:41.807
Good pirate plan, Cubby.

05:41.809 --> 05:45.644
Oh, I've got a
much better plan!

05:45.646 --> 05:49.514
Give me the little bird boat
and the treasure!

05:49.516 --> 05:53.285
Hang on tight, me hearties.
We're out of here!

05:53.287 --> 05:55.721
Come back here,
you slippery swabs!

05:55.723 --> 05:59.558
Oh dear, the sea pups
vanished into thin air...

05:59.560 --> 06:01.460
but where did they go?

06:01.462 --> 06:04.262
[both] Skybird Island?

06:06.199 --> 06:09.634
Gentle breezes.
What a beautiful day!

06:09.636 --> 06:12.137
Well, I'll be a
fluttering feather!

06:12.139 --> 06:14.406
Skybird Island, ho!

06:14.408 --> 06:17.409
All right! We reached
Skybird Island

06:17.411 --> 06:20.011
and we got four
more gold doubloons!

06:20.013 --> 06:22.013
Let's grab 'em and go!

06:22.015 --> 06:25.050
Ahoy, Princess Winger,
Wise Old Parrot!

06:25.052 --> 06:28.320
Oh, Skully, and all
my pirate friends.

06:28.322 --> 06:30.088
What a wonderful surprise!

06:30.090 --> 06:35.727
However, the biggest surprise
is that you found my old ship!

06:35.729 --> 06:38.530
Crackers!
The Leaky Beak is yours?

06:38.532 --> 06:41.867
It was a long, long time ago.

06:41.869 --> 06:44.870
I was on my way to pick
up a special treasure

06:44.872 --> 06:47.239
<i>from Never Ever Peak Mountain</i>

06:47.241 --> 06:51.343
<i>when I was caught in a</i>
<i>terrible storm at sea.</i>

06:51.345 --> 06:52.744
[thundering]

06:52.746 --> 06:55.247
<i>I was thrown off my ship!</i>

06:57.250 --> 07:00.619
Luckily, I made it back
safely to Skybird Island,

07:00.621 --> 07:04.256
but I never knew what
happened to my ship.

07:04.258 --> 07:06.691
[Jake] Good thing we found it
on Shipwreck Beach.

07:06.693 --> 07:09.094
We fixed it up and
found your map.

07:09.096 --> 07:12.697
And you found my treasure, too.

07:12.699 --> 07:14.599
Well, whenever
there's treasure,

07:14.601 --> 07:16.935
you can always
count on us findin' it!

07:16.937 --> 07:20.605
And you can always
count on me takin' it!

07:20.607 --> 07:23.608
- My word!
- Ah, coconuts!

07:23.610 --> 07:27.078
There's only room for one
captain on this little ship!

07:27.080 --> 07:29.915
Up, up, and away!

07:29.917 --> 07:34.453
Into the wild blue yonder!
[laughs]

07:34.455 --> 07:37.088
How dare that
sneaky snook do this!

07:37.090 --> 07:39.224
Fear not, Princess Winger.

07:39.226 --> 07:42.761
Captain Skully will get the
Wise Old Parrot's ship back.

07:42.763 --> 07:44.930
And your treasure, too.

07:44.932 --> 07:47.732
[chuckles] I wouldn't
worry too much about it.

07:47.734 --> 07:49.067
You wouldn't?

07:49.069 --> 07:52.103
Actually, I'm looking
forward to Old Feather Hat

07:52.105 --> 07:53.638
finding that treasure.

07:53.640 --> 07:57.209
Ah! And now to see the treasure.

07:58.611 --> 08:00.011
A whistle?

08:00.013 --> 08:01.646
What good is a whistle?

08:01.648 --> 08:04.483
Well, maybe it's
a magic whistle

08:04.485 --> 08:07.319
and when you blow it,
a treasure appears!

08:07.321 --> 08:09.321
That's ridiculous!

08:09.323 --> 08:12.491
Oh then again,
stranger things have happened!

08:12.493 --> 08:14.993
[whistles]

08:14.995 --> 08:16.661
[Jake] Hook found a whistle.

08:16.663 --> 08:19.264
But I don't see what's
so special about it.

08:19.266 --> 08:20.932
Oh, it's not just any whistle.

08:20.934 --> 08:24.035
This one calls for
some friends of mine.

08:24.037 --> 08:29.107
The Feathered Four, the Brave
Ones Who Protect Skybird Island!

08:29.109 --> 08:30.542
There they go now.

08:30.544 --> 08:34.045
Blast it all,
where's my treasure?

08:34.047 --> 08:36.915
[stuttering] Cap'n? Birds!

08:38.150 --> 08:39.651
Not now, Smee!

08:39.653 --> 08:41.887
I want... [screams]

08:41.889 --> 08:44.222
Nice birdie! Nice birdie!

08:44.224 --> 08:47.792
Oh! Saving you, cap'n!

08:47.794 --> 08:52.063
Oh, dear... [shouting]

08:52.065 --> 08:54.633
Poor Mr. Smee and
my ship are falling...

08:54.635 --> 08:56.334
Like a lead feather!

08:56.336 --> 08:58.069
This is an emergency!

08:58.071 --> 09:01.239
Then it's pixie dust time!

09:03.175 --> 09:06.044
[Smee yelling] Oh dear!

09:06.046 --> 09:08.647
Oh, thank you,
thank you, thank you.

09:08.649 --> 09:13.084
Yay-hey! We saved Mr. Smee
and the Leaky Beak

09:13.086 --> 09:15.987
and we got four more
gold doubloons!

09:15.989 --> 09:17.923
Let's grab 'em and go!

09:22.161 --> 09:25.764
[giggles] Safe and sound
on the ground, yes!

09:25.766 --> 09:28.333
[gasps] But what
about the cap'n?

09:28.335 --> 09:31.736
Pesky parrots!
Release me at once!

09:31.738 --> 09:34.839
Why, Captain Hook,
is that my whistle?

09:34.841 --> 09:37.842
How good of you to
bring it to me, old chum!

09:37.844 --> 09:41.112
But I didn't...
oh bilge water!

09:41.114 --> 09:43.882
Enough of this
birdie nonsense!

09:43.884 --> 09:46.384
- Good riddance!
- [grunts]

09:46.386 --> 09:47.786
- [Jake] So long!
- [Izzy] Bye!

09:47.788 --> 09:49.220
- Happy wings!
- G'bye!

09:49.222 --> 09:50.455
Oh, Skully!

09:50.457 --> 09:53.224
You and your pirate crew
are simply the best!

09:53.226 --> 09:56.461
Which is why I want you
all to keep the Leaky Beak

09:56.463 --> 09:58.797
as my way of saying thanks!

09:58.799 --> 10:00.732
But you're her captain!

10:00.734 --> 10:03.635
The ship has a new
captain now, Skully.

10:03.637 --> 10:06.471
- You.
- Me? For real?

10:06.473 --> 10:10.408
Captain Skully,
I love the sound of that.

10:10.410 --> 10:13.645
Way-hey for Captain Skully!

10:18.284 --> 10:23.154
<i>¶ Sail away with me</i>
<i>through the sky ¶</i>

10:23.156 --> 10:27.626
<i>¶ Cast off the anchor now</i>
<i>and we can fly! ¶</i>

10:27.628 --> 10:30.261
<i>¶ Come on mate, let's try </i>

10:30.263 --> 10:32.664
<i>¶ Sky sailing </i>

10:32.666 --> 10:35.400
<i>¶ Captain sail away with me </i>

10:35.402 --> 10:38.169
<i>¶ Sky sailing </i>

10:38.171 --> 10:42.707
<i>¶ On a pirate ship</i>
<i>with wings! ¶</i>

10:48.948 --> 10:51.616
Thanks for helping us
return the Leaky Beak's

10:51.618 --> 10:54.486
treasure to Skybird Island,
me hearties!

10:54.488 --> 10:56.488
Now let's count
our gold doubloons

10:56.490 --> 10:59.024
and put them into our
Team Treasure Chest.

11:06.132 --> 11:08.466
<i>¶ Way, hey</i>
<i>Well done, crew ¶</i>

11:08.468 --> 11:10.502
<i>¶ Everyone knew</i>
<i>just what to do ¶</i>

11:10.504 --> 11:12.537
<i>¶ Way, hey</i>
<i>With help from you ¶</i>

11:12.539 --> 11:15.440
<i>¶ It's time to count</i>
<i>our gold doubloons! ¶</i>

11:15.442 --> 11:17.842
Come on. Count with us.

11:18.611 --> 11:20.245
[all] Yeah!

11:21.614 --> 11:23.481
[Jake] One, two...

11:23.483 --> 11:26.885
[Cubby] Three,
four, five, six...

11:26.887 --> 11:30.055
[Izzy] Seven, eight, nine, ten.

11:30.057 --> 11:33.058
[Jake] Yo-ho! For solving
pirate problems today

11:33.060 --> 11:36.194
we got 10 gold doubloons!

11:36.196 --> 11:38.530
[Skully] And Cubby's got wings!

11:38.532 --> 11:40.999
Flying isn't just for the birds.

11:41.001 --> 11:43.101
[laughs]

11:47.173 --> 11:52.177
I never want to see another bird
for the rest of me life!

11:52.179 --> 11:54.813
Oh, then I guess we
won't be needin' to fill

11:54.815 --> 11:58.049
the new birdie feeder
with all this birdie-seed!

11:58.051 --> 12:00.185
Birdie-seed?

12:00.187 --> 12:03.922
I'm not feeding any
birdies on my ship!

12:03.924 --> 12:05.757
Give me that!

12:05.759 --> 12:07.592
[squawking]

12:07.594 --> 12:11.663
- Smee!
- Have a nice flight, cap'n!

12:17.203 --> 12:20.605
<i>[Jake] The Mystery</i>
<i>of Mysterious Island!</i>

12:22.675 --> 12:27.011
Look alive! It be Bucky
and them little popinjays!

12:27.013 --> 12:32.917
Ah-ha, Mr. Smee.
Here come those pesky
pint-sized pirates.

12:32.919 --> 12:36.121
Only this time
they shan't bother me,

12:36.123 --> 12:38.590
thanks to me latest device...

12:38.592 --> 12:43.628
The Foggy-Fogger 500!
It makes fog!

12:43.630 --> 12:45.363
Clever, cap'n!

12:45.365 --> 12:48.099
Why if you make a cloud
of fog around our ship,

12:48.101 --> 12:51.469
the sea pups won't
be able to see us!

12:51.471 --> 12:56.808
[chuckles] Exactly! And then
I can easily spy on them!

12:56.810 --> 13:00.044
Observe, if you please.

13:00.913 --> 13:02.347
[whistles]

13:07.386 --> 13:09.988
[Izzy gasps] I found it!

13:09.990 --> 13:13.091
I can't believe my
beach ball floated this far!

13:13.093 --> 13:16.261
Heads up, me hearties! Land ho!

13:16.263 --> 13:18.630
Land? Here?

13:18.632 --> 13:20.732
There's no island on my map.

13:20.734 --> 13:23.067
[gasps] Could it be?

13:23.069 --> 13:25.970
It's the Mysterious Island!

13:25.972 --> 13:27.939
Sounds mysterious.

13:27.941 --> 13:29.440
It is.

13:29.442 --> 13:32.110
Legend says it
appears out of nowhere,

13:32.112 --> 13:34.946
then disappears just as quickly!

13:34.948 --> 13:38.817
No one knows why or when
the island appears
and then disappears.

13:38.819 --> 13:42.520
And no one's ever
stepped foot on it!

13:42.522 --> 13:45.790
I guess that's why it's
called Mysterious Island.

13:45.792 --> 13:49.427
Hey, let's be the first
pirates to explore the island!

13:49.429 --> 13:53.331
Maybe we can find out
what makes it appear
and then disappear!

13:53.333 --> 13:58.503
Mateys, would you like to
help us solve the mystery
of Mysterious Island?

14:00.005 --> 14:01.639
Great!

14:01.641 --> 14:04.108
Keep a look out
for gold doubloons.

14:04.110 --> 14:07.111
Whenever we solve a
pirate problem together,
they'll appear.

14:07.113 --> 14:10.348
Then we'll collect 'em
and put 'em in our
Team Treasure Chest.

14:10.350 --> 14:12.917
Yo-ho, let's go!

14:16.488 --> 14:18.957
<i>¶ Yo-ho, mateys away </i>

14:18.959 --> 14:21.960
<i>¶ There'll be treasure</i>
<i>and adventure today ¶</i>

14:21.962 --> 14:23.394
<i>¶ Let's go </i>

14:23.396 --> 14:26.898
<i>¶ Heave ho, here we go</i>
<i>Together as a team ¶</i>

14:26.900 --> 14:30.068
<i>¶ Jake and the</i>
<i>Never Land Pirates ¶</i>

14:30.070 --> 14:32.403
<i>¶ And me </i>

14:34.907 --> 14:38.076
[Hook] Well, well,
so the puny pirates

14:38.078 --> 14:41.646
have set their sights
on Mysterious Island!

14:41.648 --> 14:43.715
Mysterious Island?

14:43.717 --> 14:47.752
Oh... I heard that
it comes, it goes,

14:47.754 --> 14:51.756
and where it stops,
nobody knows.

14:51.758 --> 14:53.992
And them that goes
lookin' for it,

14:53.994 --> 14:56.027
never comes back.

14:56.029 --> 14:57.996
Oh, poppycock.

14:57.998 --> 15:01.199
We'll soon know
all there is to know
about that island!

15:01.201 --> 15:06.337
Sharky, Bones! Set sail
for Mysterious Island!

15:06.339 --> 15:09.107
[Sharky and Bones]
Aye-aye, cap'n.

15:09.109 --> 15:13.411
Time to make more fog and slow
down those scurvy little swabs

15:13.413 --> 15:16.614
so we can sneak past them!

15:16.616 --> 15:17.982
[whistling]

15:20.219 --> 15:22.921
[Cubby] Hey!
What's with all this fog?

15:22.923 --> 15:24.856
I can't see a thing!

15:24.858 --> 15:26.891
[Izzy] Shiver me timbers!

15:26.893 --> 15:29.193
We've got to
get rid of this fog!

15:31.897 --> 15:35.633
Good idea, Bucky!
Let's fan the fog away.

15:38.737 --> 15:41.539
Yay-hey!
We fanned the fog away

15:41.541 --> 15:43.942
and we got three gold doubloons!

15:43.944 --> 15:47.178
Let's grab 'em and go
to Mysterious Island!

15:48.080 --> 15:51.883
Uh, there's one problem.

15:51.885 --> 15:54.385
Mysterious Island is gone!

15:54.387 --> 15:56.921
Gone? But how?

15:56.923 --> 15:58.923
It's a mystery.

15:58.925 --> 16:02.060
But that isn't!
The Jolly Roger!

16:02.062 --> 16:04.295
This is impossible!

16:04.297 --> 16:07.498
The Mysterious Island
vanished into thin air!

16:07.500 --> 16:12.437
[gulps] It's like they say:
Now ya sees it, now ya's don't!

16:12.439 --> 16:17.275
Next thing ya know, we'll all
be disappearin' like... ghosts!

16:17.277 --> 16:19.444
Well, we haven't
disappeared yet,

16:19.446 --> 16:23.147
and now the sea pups can
see us as clear as day!

16:23.149 --> 16:26.017
[Jake] Ahoy,
Captain Hook, Mr. Smee!

16:26.019 --> 16:29.587
We're on our way to solve the
mystery of Mysterious Island.

16:29.589 --> 16:33.191
- Have you seen it?
- Island? Here?

16:33.193 --> 16:35.026
Why that's preposterous!

16:35.028 --> 16:36.995
- [thundering]
- [yelling]

16:36.997 --> 16:38.763
[Hook] What in plunder...

16:38.765 --> 16:40.765
[all shouting]

16:40.767 --> 16:43.101
- [Cubby] Holy coconuts!
- [Smee] Oh, my!

16:43.103 --> 16:46.537
[Jake] Mysterious Island just
popped up right underneath us.

16:46.539 --> 16:49.307
This is unbelievable!

16:49.309 --> 16:52.844
Why it's positively mysterious!

16:52.846 --> 16:57.849
<i>¶ Ohhh ohhh </i>

16:57.851 --> 17:00.718
<i>¶ Mysterious Mystery Island </i>

17:00.720 --> 17:03.654
<i>¶ Why oh why</i>
<i>do you disappear? ¶</i>

17:03.656 --> 17:06.057
<i>¶ Mysterious Mystery Island </i>

17:06.059 --> 17:08.960
<i>¶ First your gone</i>
<i>and then you're right here ¶</i>

17:08.962 --> 17:11.963
<i>¶ Why are you</i>
<i>playing hide and seeky? ¶</i>

17:11.965 --> 17:14.732
<i>¶ How can an island</i>
<i>be so creepy? ¶</i>

17:14.734 --> 17:16.034
[both shout]

17:16.036 --> 17:18.002
<i>¶ Mysterious Mystery Island </i>

17:18.004 --> 17:20.405
<i>¶ Gone again </i>

17:20.407 --> 17:22.774
¶ And then you're right here

17:23.809 --> 17:25.243
C'mon, mateys.

17:25.245 --> 17:28.913
Let's explore the island
and find out why it keeps
disappearing!

17:30.349 --> 17:33.985
This place is weird.
The ground's really
hard and shiny

17:33.987 --> 17:37.388
and look at these
funny looking streams!

17:37.390 --> 17:40.625
This isn't like any island
I've ever been on.

17:41.393 --> 17:43.027
Oh, dear.

17:43.029 --> 17:46.030
I'm afraid you won't be the
first pirate to step foot

17:46.032 --> 17:47.899
on Mysterious Island, cap'n.

17:47.901 --> 17:50.868
Perhaps! But it's not too late

17:50.870 --> 17:54.906
for me to be the first
pirate to solve the mystery!

17:54.908 --> 17:56.974
Follow me, boys!

17:58.844 --> 18:02.213
Careful, everybody!
The ground is as
slippery as an eel,

18:02.215 --> 18:04.515
especially the green stuff.

18:04.517 --> 18:06.284
[yelling]

18:08.454 --> 18:10.521
[gasps] Huh? Whoa!

18:12.257 --> 18:16.194
We've got to stop
Cubby from sliding
and getting hurt!

18:16.196 --> 18:18.930
I've got an idea.

18:18.932 --> 18:21.599
Grab the end of the
seaweed rope, Cubby!

18:21.601 --> 18:23.101
Yeah!

18:23.802 --> 18:24.969
Got it!

18:24.971 --> 18:28.272
Now, let's reel him in,
me hearties.

18:28.274 --> 18:30.641
Thanks for fishin'
me out, mateys!

18:30.643 --> 18:33.744
Yo-ho, way to go!
We worked together,

18:33.746 --> 18:35.980
stopped Cubby from
sliding away and

18:35.982 --> 18:40.251
got three more gold doubloons!
Let's grab 'em and go!

18:40.253 --> 18:42.286
Blast!

18:42.288 --> 18:44.789
Save me, Smee!

18:44.791 --> 18:47.725
[yelling] I'm trying, sir!

18:47.727 --> 18:48.993
[Smee yelling]

18:50.963 --> 18:52.563
Are you OK, Captain Hook?

18:52.565 --> 18:54.065
I'll be fine.

18:54.067 --> 18:58.302
But is this any way for
my island to treat me?

18:58.304 --> 19:01.072
After all,
I am its new owner.

19:01.074 --> 19:04.408
What? This island
doesn't belong to you!

19:04.410 --> 19:07.445
I, Captain Hook,
claim this island

19:07.447 --> 19:10.781
to belong to Captain Hook!

19:10.783 --> 19:13.618
[grunts]

19:13.620 --> 19:16.187
What in blazes?!

19:16.189 --> 19:18.022
There.

19:18.024 --> 19:20.258
Mysterious Island is mine!

19:20.260 --> 19:21.826
All mine!

19:21.828 --> 19:25.296
So, get off me
island, puny pests.

19:25.298 --> 19:26.931
You're trespassing!

19:26.933 --> 19:31.536
Hook, you can't just say you own
the island and then kick us off!

19:31.538 --> 19:33.437
- I can't?
- [gasps]

19:33.439 --> 19:36.807
And who, pray tell,
is going to stop me?

19:36.809 --> 19:39.477
[stuttering] Maybe him?

19:39.479 --> 19:40.945
Him who?

19:42.214 --> 19:44.849
[screeching]

19:44.851 --> 19:46.684
Save me, Smee!

19:46.686 --> 19:50.254
[stuttering]
Save us all, Mr. Smee!

19:52.658 --> 19:55.693
Shiver me timbers
from head to toe!

19:55.695 --> 19:58.863
That's the biggest
sea serpent ever!

19:58.865 --> 20:03.334
That's not a sea serpent.
It's a Giant Sea Turtle!

20:03.336 --> 20:06.504
That means we're standing
on the turtles shell!

20:06.506 --> 20:09.974
Then Mysterious Island
isn't an island after all?

20:09.976 --> 20:15.813
No! And that's why it
appears and disappears
in the Never Sea!

20:15.815 --> 20:19.717
Yeah! This place is
really a Giant Sea Turtle

20:19.719 --> 20:22.553
swimming around and
diving under the water!

20:22.555 --> 20:27.024
All right! We did it!
We solved the mystery
of Mysterious Island!

20:27.026 --> 20:29.360
Woo-hoo!
Let's celebrate!

20:29.362 --> 20:31.963
[screeching]

20:34.366 --> 20:36.000
We'd better
get back to Bucky...

20:36.002 --> 20:38.536
Unless we want
to take a swim!

20:38.538 --> 20:40.538
Step lively, boys!

20:40.540 --> 20:44.909
- Back to the Jolly Roger...
- [all shouting]

20:44.911 --> 20:46.043
- Whoa!
- No way!

20:46.045 --> 20:48.379
- Whoa!
- Quick! On your feet!

20:48.381 --> 20:50.781
We've got to get
back on Bucky, fast!

20:50.783 --> 20:55.086
This is an emergency!
Pixie dust away!

20:55.420 --> 20:56.954
Thanks, Izz.

20:56.956 --> 20:58.789
Now let's give old Hook
and his men a hand.

21:00.959 --> 21:03.394
Captain Hook,
do you need a lift?

21:03.396 --> 21:04.862
Never!

21:06.198 --> 21:10.368
Uh... Well, if you insist.

21:11.937 --> 21:15.106
- [Hook yelling]
- [Smee] Oh, my...

21:15.108 --> 21:17.775
- Wee!
- [grunts]

21:17.777 --> 21:19.977
Way-hey!

21:19.979 --> 21:24.215
We rescued everybody
and we got four more
gold doubloons!

21:24.217 --> 21:26.917
Let's grab 'em and go!

21:26.919 --> 21:28.653
- [Jake] So long!
- [Cubby] Bye!

21:28.655 --> 21:30.755
- [Izzy] Fair winds!
- [Skully] Ciao!

21:30.757 --> 21:34.558
[chuckles] Gee, I wonder where
the Giant Turtle is going now?

21:34.560 --> 21:36.627
It's a mystery!

21:38.764 --> 21:41.832
Mateys, thanks for
helping us explore
Mysterious Island

21:41.834 --> 21:43.567
and solving its mystery!

21:43.569 --> 21:47.805
Now let's put all
our gold doubloons into
our Team Treasure Chest!

21:54.913 --> 21:57.248
<i>¶ Way, hey</i>
<i>Well done, crew ¶</i>

21:57.250 --> 21:59.283
<i>¶ Everyone knew</i>
<i>just what to do ¶</i>

21:59.285 --> 22:01.319
<i>¶ Way, hey</i>
<i>With help from you ¶</i>

22:01.321 --> 22:04.155
<i>¶ It's time to count</i>
<i>our gold doubloons! ¶</i>

22:04.157 --> 22:06.590
Come on. Count with us.

22:07.759 --> 22:09.193
[all] Yeah!

22:10.095 --> 22:12.763
[Cubby] One, two, three...

22:12.765 --> 22:15.266
[Jake] Four, five, six...

22:15.268 --> 22:18.336
[Izzy] Seven, eight, nine, ten!

22:18.338 --> 22:21.205
[Jake] Yo-ho! For solving
pirate problems today,

22:21.207 --> 22:24.008
we got 10 gold doubloons.

22:24.010 --> 22:26.544
And we've got another mystery.

22:26.546 --> 22:28.612
Where'd everybody go?

22:28.614 --> 22:32.083
[laughing] We're right here!

22:34.786 --> 22:37.288
[Hook sighs] Alas, Mr. Smee.

22:37.290 --> 22:41.158
All I wanted was an
island of me own.

22:41.160 --> 22:43.694
Is that too much to ask?

22:43.696 --> 22:45.129
Cheer up, cap'n!

22:45.131 --> 22:47.765
I see a tiny island up ahead.

22:49.501 --> 22:51.902
Good eye, Mr. Smee.

22:51.904 --> 22:54.538
I, the great and
glorious Captain Hook

22:54.540 --> 22:56.974
claim this island to be...

22:56.976 --> 22:58.909
