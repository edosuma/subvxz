The bells did un-bury it.

02:42.500 --> 02:44.625
Yes. My bells!

03:12.333 --> 03:14.583
[Thaddeus] Find a way to open this,

03:15.083 --> 03:17.083
Miss Archaeologist.

03:17.500 --> 03:18.709
[Thaddeus] Or...

-Or, uh, not.

03:36.166 --> 03:37.750
[engine dies]

03:37.917 --> 03:40.834
[Baloo] Uh, you can open
your eyes now, Louie.

03:42.000 --> 03:44.583
[Thaddeus] Well? The gate.

03:44.792 --> 03:47.125
[Katie] This says
the whole city is based on

03:47.208 --> 03:49.500

03:49.834 --> 03:51.834
-Let me borrow this.

04:09.291 --> 04:10.625
[Thaddeus] Good.

04:10.959 --> 04:12.917
You first.

04:18.834 --> 04:22.417
[Katie] I never really believed it
until now.

04:25.125 --> 04:28.458
And somewhere in there is a room.

04:28.542 --> 04:30.458
A room holding a weapon

04:30.542 --> 04:33.417
that will make the world mine.

04:33.500 --> 04:36.375
[laughs]

04:36.834 --> 04:38.583
Now find it.

04:39.083 --> 04:42.083
And maybe I'll let you live.

04:58.417 --> 04:59.875
[Louie] What are you doing?

04:59.959 --> 05:02.500
Waiting for the 2:25 bus.

05:02.583 --> 05:04.500
[Louie] Snap out of it, cuz.

05:04.583 --> 05:06.625
This is just a mirage.

05:07.208 --> 05:08.417
Doggone it.

05:08.834 --> 05:12.208
Now what am I gonna do
with this bus token I bought?

05:13.333 --> 05:15.250
[wind howls]

05:15.333 --> 05:18.291
Sure wish we'd made it back
to Gathia, Louie...

05:18.375 --> 05:19.834
For Katie's sake.

05:20.041 --> 05:22.125
Me too, cuz.

05:22.208 --> 05:25.083
[coughs] Me, too.

05:38.709 --> 05:41.709
Well? Is this the weapon house?

05:41.792 --> 05:43.208
I'm not sure.

05:43.375 --> 05:45.875
[Thaddeus] It has to be. How do I get in?

05:46.917 --> 05:47.917
Do you sing?

05:49.166 --> 05:52.792
I'm serious. Some sound, or chord, or note

05:52.875 --> 05:54.000
probably opens it.

05:54.083 --> 05:56.417
[Katie] According to this, it's a B.

06:01.959 --> 06:02.959

[sings note]

06:23.125 --> 06:24.500
[heavy thud]

06:30.792 --> 06:32.125
The weapon...

06:32.208 --> 06:33.709
It really exists.

06:33.792 --> 06:38.250
A machine that can destroy anything
with sound waves.

06:40.166 --> 06:43.083
Let us test it.

07:43.166 --> 07:44.125
[Thaddeus] Stop her!

07:44.208 --> 07:46.208
[mercenaries yelling]

07:53.917 --> 07:56.417
Leaving so soon?

07:57.250 --> 08:01.083
Boy, when did we buy a ticket
for the rollycoaster?

08:01.166 --> 08:03.542
Come on. We've got to tell the police.

08:04.041 --> 08:06.166
[policeman] Now let me get this straight.

08:06.250 --> 08:10.542
That earthquake was caused by a weapon
made out of bells from a sand storm city

08:10.625 --> 08:13.417
filled with red-robed thugs
and flying beetles.

08:13.625 --> 08:16.917
Pre-tootin-cisely.
So now what are you gonna do about it?

08:17.000 --> 08:18.000
Sergeant!

08:18.083 --> 08:20.625
-[Louie] Easy on the haberdashery, man!
-[Baloo] Watch what you're doing!

08:20.709 --> 08:22.458
[both grunt]

08:22.542 --> 08:24.083
Hey, watch who you're tossin'!

08:24.166 --> 08:27.417
Old blokes are as loony
as that girl archaeologist.

08:27.500 --> 08:29.709
A bit too much sun if you ask me.

08:39.500 --> 08:42.207
-There is some truth in your story.
-[beetle buzzing]

08:42.291 --> 08:45.083
We found this note tied
to the beetle's back.

08:45.667 --> 08:48.458
Yeah, Klang! That's the guy.

08:48.542 --> 08:50.333
And he's got Katie prisoner.

08:51.417 --> 08:54.583
Seems this chap is giving us till sunset

08:54.667 --> 08:57.583
-to bring him ten million guilders.
-[scuffle continues]

08:57.667 --> 09:00.166
Otherwise, he'll shake the city to dust.

09:00.250 --> 09:02.834
And he's got the blender to do it.

09:03.208 --> 09:05.417
We've got tanks and guns.

09:05.500 --> 09:07.709
I think we can handle it.

09:07.792 --> 09:09.208
[tank approaching]

09:16.166 --> 09:19.917
So, they're ignoring my ransom note.

09:20.000 --> 09:22.583
[laughs] The fools!

09:22.667 --> 09:26.625
Oh, shake it, Baloo. We've got to get
Katie before those tanks do.

09:26.709 --> 09:28.542
Now, what would Wildcat do?

09:31.667 --> 09:32.917

10:26.333 --> 10:28.000
[grunts] Louie!

10:28.250 --> 10:31.208
[Louie] I know, I know. Isn't this getting
kind of redundant?

10:35.375 --> 10:37.250
Those meddling pilots.

10:37.458 --> 10:39.250
[Thaddeus] Unleash the beetles!

10:39.667 --> 10:42.333
Hey, we're in one piece.

10:42.583 --> 10:44.250
-[thud]
-Speak for yourself.

10:44.333 --> 10:46.500
My head feels like a maraca.

10:46.750 --> 10:49.458
[Baloo] Look... Katie's city.

10:49.709 --> 10:51.709
[Louie] Come on.
Let's find the gal and scram.

10:51.792 --> 10:54.875
Yeah, she probably misses me
something fierce.

10:54.959 --> 10:57.542
Ha! Don't flatter yourself.
No one's listening.

10:57.625 --> 10:59.792
[mercenaries yelling]

10:59.875 --> 11:01.125
Then again...

11:02.834 --> 11:04.959
[yelling continues]

11:10.125 --> 11:10.959
See?

11:11.041 --> 11:12.750
[laughs] That was easy.

11:12.834 --> 11:14.125
[beetle buzzes]

11:14.291 --> 11:17.000
[Baloo] Help! Get a fly swatter!

-Don't thank me yet.
-[beetles buzzing in distance]

11:29.208 --> 11:31.500
-[Louie] We got bugs in the belfry.
-[loud trampling]

11:34.500 --> 11:36.792
Sorry for the inconvenience

11:36.875 --> 11:38.917
but I can't have you running off.

11:39.166 --> 11:42.583
[Thaddeus] You're the reason
I have this wonderful city.

11:42.667 --> 11:45.709
[grunts]
Tinabula is an archaeological treasure.

11:45.792 --> 11:48.583
It has secrets and mysteries
that need exploring and--

11:48.667 --> 11:49.542
[laughs]

11:49.667 --> 11:52.208
But we've already found the secret,
Miss Dodd.

11:52.667 --> 11:53.625
The weapon.

11:54.000 --> 11:56.500
And the weapon means power...

11:56.750 --> 11:58.959
Unstoppable power!

11:59.667 --> 12:02.083
Not if I find the master bell...

12:02.458 --> 12:04.417
Master bell?

12:04.959 --> 12:06.417
What is this?

12:06.834 --> 12:07.959
[Thaddeus] Speak up!

12:08.166 --> 12:09.917
What do you know?

12:15.500 --> 12:16.834
Hey, look what I found.

12:16.917 --> 12:18.917
[Katie] Baloo! Louie!

12:19.000 --> 12:19.834
Katie!

12:19.917 --> 12:22.166
[grunts]
How do we get you out of there?

12:22.250 --> 12:25.750
A note. There's a musical note
that opens it.

12:26.083 --> 12:27.417
Allow me.

12:27.500 --> 12:30.834
[singing]

12:31.917 --> 12:32.750
Show off.

12:37.291 --> 12:39.792
[chuckles]
Now I got my hug, too, Baloo.

12:40.250 --> 12:42.041
Fine. Gloat about it, why...

12:42.125 --> 12:44.166
[beetles buzzing]

12:46.166 --> 12:47.417
[Baloo] Company!

12:47.625 --> 12:49.542
The duck's this way.

12:50.000 --> 12:53.709
No. First we have to find the master bell.

12:54.000 --> 12:55.208
Master bell?

12:55.542 --> 12:59.208
According to the legend,
it is the sound that silences all.

12:59.291 --> 13:01.291
[Katie] It's the only way to stop Klang.

13:01.542 --> 13:03.542
-[beetles buzzing]
-[loud trampling]

13:08.709 --> 13:11.709
[Thaddeus] Capture them. Capture them!

13:12.250 --> 13:13.750
Aah!

13:25.458 --> 13:26.959
[buzzing]

13:39.250 --> 13:41.166
[bells ringing]

13:45.000 --> 13:47.291
[heroic music]

13:58.250 --> 14:02.625
Aw, talk about your sour notes...

14:10.959 --> 14:13.667
[beetles buzzing]

14:17.083 --> 14:20.125
I ain't gonna play no swan song
without a tussle.

14:20.208 --> 14:22.375
I'm with you, my man.

14:23.875 --> 14:25.792
[Katie] Swan song? That's it.

14:26.333 --> 14:28.250
-Jump!
-[Baloo and Louie] Huh?

14:34.291 --> 14:35.458
[clang]

14:35.709 --> 14:37.375
[squeaking]

14:41.417 --> 14:42.291
[laughs]

14:42.375 --> 14:45.500
Katie, we could make
beautiful music together.

14:45.750 --> 14:49.208
A whole city built
on sounds and harmonics.

14:49.750 --> 14:53.333
Where would they hide a bell large enough
to silence it all?

14:53.875 --> 14:56.875
And you'd need a chime
as big as this tower.

14:57.083 --> 15:00.667
Baloo, you're right. It <i>is </i> the tower.

15:04.208 --> 15:05.083
[clang]

15:05.166 --> 15:07.417
[rumbling and crackling]

15:18.875 --> 15:20.333
[thud]

15:26.542 --> 15:28.875
[Katie] This is the master bell!

15:30.417 --> 15:32.000
You genius!

15:32.458 --> 15:33.917
[chuckles] That's two, cuz.

15:37.417 --> 15:38.709
[clunk]

15:40.125 --> 15:41.542
How do you ring it?

15:42.291 --> 15:45.250
"The final note falls from above."

15:48.709 --> 15:50.709
[Baloo] The beetle's the bell clapper!

15:51.125 --> 15:54.750
Dang it. Must be a release lever
something on top.

15:55.125 --> 15:58.417
Oh, no. You ain't playing hero
on this one.

15:58.500 --> 15:59.792
[thud]

16:00.333 --> 16:01.709
I'll flip you for it.

16:01.959 --> 16:05.125
Well, we'll use my coin this time. Heads.

16:06.583 --> 16:07.583
[Louie] Well?

16:08.250 --> 16:09.417
[sighs] It's heads.

16:09.667 --> 16:12.333
Later, my man.
I'm off to ring some chimes.

16:12.875 --> 16:14.041
[Katie] Do be careful, Louie.

16:15.208 --> 16:16.458
[Baloo] Wait a minute!

16:16.959 --> 16:18.709
It's a trick coin!

16:19.041 --> 16:23.083
So sue me. Besides,
you're a better pilot. Go fly.

16:23.291 --> 16:25.041
For once he's right.

16:33.208 --> 16:35.125
Nothing like working without a net.

16:35.208 --> 16:36.291
[Louie chuckles]

16:46.750 --> 16:49.000
[Katie panting] Wait, Baloo.

16:49.083 --> 16:50.333
My bells!

16:52.333 --> 16:54.709
[Baloo] Leave them, sweetheart.
We got to scoot.

16:54.917 --> 16:58.125
No, I need them to prove
that I found this place.

16:58.625 --> 17:01.000
I wonder why they were left here.

17:01.083 --> 17:04.250
-[Thaddeus cocks gun]
-Because I knew you'd stop for them.

17:04.750 --> 17:08.333
Pity you'll never leave this place alive.

17:09.165 --> 17:12.875
Speaking of places...
You ever been to Fist City?

17:12.959 --> 17:14.666
-[clang]
-[Baloo] Ow!

17:14.750 --> 17:18.583
[grunts]
Now I know why they call him Klang.

17:18.666 --> 17:21.333
Enough comedy. Goodbye.

17:21.666 --> 17:22.666
[Katie] Duck, Baloo!

17:23.125 --> 17:25.125
[bells clanging]

17:27.834 --> 17:28.667
[thud]

17:30.041 --> 17:31.875
-Run!
-[bells ring]

17:31.959 --> 17:35.583
[Louie grunts]
This is getting too exciting for me.

17:38.458 --> 17:39.959
[Baloo] In, in!

17:40.625 --> 17:42.041
[Katie] Are we going to make it?

17:42.125 --> 17:45.125
With one engine and no runway,
probably not.

17:45.208 --> 17:46.875
[engine starts]

17:49.792 --> 17:52.291
They shall pay for their impertinence.

17:52.625 --> 17:54.000
[steps]

17:54.250 --> 17:56.667
[Thaddeus] What is that fool doing?

17:58.083 --> 17:59.542
[gasps]

18:00.250 --> 18:02.208
[Thaddeus] The master bell.

18:05.208 --> 18:08.542
Come on, baby, come on, baby!

18:20.625 --> 18:22.917
[clanging and rumbling]

18:23.208 --> 18:24.250
Whoa!

18:25.375 --> 18:27.458
I shall not miss again.

18:29.250 --> 18:30.417
We got to get to Louie.

18:32.375 --> 18:35.250
So how do I get this rock rolling, man?

18:37.000 --> 18:38.166
[rope crackling]

18:39.500 --> 18:40.542
[loud clang]

18:41.583 --> 18:43.333
[explosion]

18:59.458 --> 19:01.417
Jump, Louie!

19:08.750 --> 19:10.792
[crackling]

19:12.208 --> 19:14.542
No!

19:17.041 --> 19:18.959
[loud clang]

19:26.375 --> 19:28.500
[rumbling]

19:30.083 --> 19:32.500
[bells ringing]

19:35.792 --> 19:38.083
Can't you fly any higher, Baloo?

19:42.000 --> 19:44.083
Only one engine!

19:52.208 --> 19:54.000
[rocks hitting the plane]

19:54.083 --> 19:56.291
What are you, nuts, lady?

19:56.375 --> 19:58.792
No, the bell!

19:59.041 --> 19:59.875
[clang]

20:00.834 --> 20:02.834
[rumbling]

20:10.083 --> 20:14.041
Oh, no, no, no!

20:14.125 --> 20:16.458
[trembling]

20:27.125 --> 20:31.417
That's the last we'll ever see
of our old buddy, Klang.

20:31.917 --> 20:35.917
[sighs]
Tinabula, a lost city again.

20:36.000 --> 20:37.667
[wind howls]

20:44.625 --> 20:46.792
[hissing]

20:47.875 --> 20:48.875
[thump]

21:01.291 --> 21:03.792
So, after I take Katie dancing,

21:03.875 --> 21:06.375
I figured we'd eat at the Casbah Club.

21:06.458 --> 21:08.792
Well, it's going to be
a lonely dinner,

21:08.875 --> 21:11.709
considering I'm taking her to the Ritz.

21:11.959 --> 21:13.583
[bells ringing]

21:13.667 --> 21:16.417
Baloo, Louie, you'll never believe it.

21:16.500 --> 21:20.667
The Gathia Museum had asked me to
give a lecture on Tinabula tonight.

21:20.750 --> 21:21.709
Tonight?

21:21.792 --> 21:24.125
Tonight tonight?
You mean, in a little while?

21:24.208 --> 21:26.208
-Yes! Isn't that wonderful?
-[bells chime]

21:26.291 --> 21:30.083
-B-but...
-Oh, yeah, I was hoping, that would...

21:30.208 --> 21:32.333
[Katie] I knew you'd understand.

21:35.625 --> 21:38.000
Thank you. Thank you, both.

21:38.083 --> 21:40.792
This never could've
happened without you two.

21:42.291 --> 21:44.875
Women. Huh! Go figure 'em.

21:46.125 --> 21:48.208
[both sigh]

21:48.291 --> 21:52.291
Well... so what you want to do
for the rest of our vacation?

21:52.375 --> 21:55.083
Tssh. Anything but
treasure hunting, Baloo.

21:55.166 --> 21:58.875
Right, and no more falling
for pretty faces.

21:58.959 --> 22:00.417
[woman] Psst!

22:00.500 --> 22:04.792
Excuse me. Did I hear you mention
treasure hunting?

22:04.875 --> 22:06.834
It just so happens I have this map.

22:20.458 --> 22:22.583
Oh, what did I say?
