WEBVTT

00:04.176 --> 00:06.805
ER

00:06.806 --> 00:08.398
Previously on ER...

00:08.399 --> 00:10.432
It was really lovely last night.

00:11.449 --> 00:14.700
I would really like you
to consider a date.

00:14.701 --> 00:16.667
...seeing as I do work for you...

00:17.484 --> 00:19.644
...I don't think
it would be such a good idea.

00:20.045 --> 00:21.915
Oh, I see. You have a policy.

00:21.916 --> 00:25.053
- Yes, I do.
- No fraternizing with people at work.

00:27.480 --> 00:31.039
He's in heroin withdrawal.
The mother's stealing his methadone.

00:31.040 --> 00:32.640
So she split?

00:38.047 --> 00:40.822
"Suffer The Little Children"

00:42.000 --> 00:48.074

01:17.064 --> 01:19.352
Have you heard of the Velvet Lounge?

01:19.567 --> 01:20.681
Of course.

01:20.901 --> 01:24.235
I saw in the Tribune
they' re having a jam session tonight.

01:25.406 --> 01:28.740
- You don't wanna go to the South Side.
- It's a rough area?

01:29.118 --> 01:30.992
I mean it's not a good idea.

01:32.287 --> 01:36.072
When I was in Belfast, I went
to the Bogside to hear Lick the Tins.

01:37.877 --> 01:39.537
It's an IRA stronghold.

01:41.547 --> 01:42.923
It's not the same thing.

01:43.633 --> 01:45.008
Plans for his discharge?

01:45.218 --> 01:47.791
Well, his vitals are stable.

01:48.012 --> 01:49.970
- Any vomiting or diarrhea?
- No.

01:50.182 --> 01:53.550
He's keeping down POs and is back
on regular doses of methadone.

01:53.768 --> 01:56.094
I'd like to start a course
of long-term withdrawal.

01:56.312 --> 02:00.061
- Mrs. Thorvaldsen from DCFS come up?
- Yes. We had a team meeting.

02:00.316 --> 02:03.567
He can't live with a mother
that steals his methadone.

02:03.778 --> 02:05.154
We all agree with your note.

02:05.363 --> 02:06.906
The home is unsuitable.

02:07.116 --> 02:10.151
And Social Services
has found a foster family.

02:11.369 --> 02:14.821
- Experienced with drug babies?
- The mother is a retired nurse.

02:15.040 --> 02:16.072
Yeah.

02:18.544 --> 02:21.747
Just making sure you don't slip
through the cracks, kiddo.

02:30.598 --> 02:33.764
Hi, Carter! I wanted to catch you
before you got in.

02:33.934 --> 02:36.176
- Anything wrong?
- No, everything's great.

02:36.395 --> 02:38.933
You met my friend the other night
from Philly?

02:39.148 --> 02:41.058
Max? You showing him the town?

02:41.275 --> 02:45.273
Remember I told you I was involved
with somebody and it wasn't over yet?

02:45.488 --> 02:47.944
- Yeah, I figured he was the guy.
- Yeah.

02:49.283 --> 02:52.534
- What about his heroin addiction?
- Not heroin, painkillers.

02:52.703 --> 02:53.735
Percoset.

02:53.955 --> 02:56.161
He's okay.
Actually, he's here for a job.

02:56.374 --> 02:58.865
He's coming in today
to do a feasibility study...

02:59.086 --> 03:01.577
...on setting up a Pedes unit in the ER.

03:01.880 --> 03:04.371
That doesn't sound like a coincidence.

03:05.258 --> 03:07.880
Listen, Carter,
before you run into him...

03:08.094 --> 03:10.632
...I've given you
a one-sided picture of Max.

03:10.847 --> 03:12.721
He's smart.

03:12.933 --> 03:14.130
He's very dedicated.

03:14.351 --> 03:15.976
He's a really good guy.

03:16.812 --> 03:17.891
Want me to like him?

03:18.480 --> 03:21.814
Just don't judge him
from things I've said in the past.

03:22.026 --> 03:23.567
Sounds like you're back together.

03:24.069 --> 03:25.528
I don't know about that.

03:25.737 --> 03:26.900
Honestly, I don't.

03:28.782 --> 03:31.143
- Where is he now?
- My place.

04:27.171 --> 04:30.006
Malik, who left this with my mail?

04:30.215 --> 04:32.090
Mr. Dougherty from Salutech.

04:32.259 --> 04:34.631
Yeah? See that it gets returned.

04:34.845 --> 04:37.252
A salesman from Salutech
left me a pen.

04:37.431 --> 04:40.099
I got mine right here.
He also left free samples.

04:40.350 --> 04:42.840
I won't be bribed
into using their products.

04:43.061 --> 04:46.096
Kerry, Mark, you know Dr. Keinholz...

04:46.313 --> 04:49.065
...Chief of Pediatrics
and Dean of the Med School.

04:49.566 --> 04:52.235
This is Dr. Rosher.
Doctors Greene, Weaver.

04:52.443 --> 04:53.475
Nice to meet you.

04:53.695 --> 04:57.562
Dr. Rosher's a pediatrician
and assistant professor at CHoP.

04:57.823 --> 05:01.323
He's evaluating the need for
pediatric emergency centers at ERs.

05:01.536 --> 05:04.986
And we're fortunate he's responded
to our call for a study here.

05:05.205 --> 05:07.281
I thought this was under discussion.

05:07.499 --> 05:10.286
It happens that Dr. Rosher
is free at this time.

05:10.501 --> 05:12.707
I just finished a study
at Hennepin County.

05:12.920 --> 05:16.538
I have to scrub. But give
Dr. Rosher the support he needs.

05:16.757 --> 05:19.426
- Sure. No problem.
- Thank you, doctors.

05:21.345 --> 05:22.375
So...

05:22.595 --> 05:24.552
...they sprung me on you. Sorry.

05:24.765 --> 05:25.843
No. It's fine.

05:26.056 --> 05:29.341
I'd be happy to review our pediatric
census statistics with you.

05:29.560 --> 05:31.387
First, I'd like to see the place.

05:31.603 --> 05:33.395
You can follow me, Dr. Rosher.

05:33.606 --> 05:35.597
I hate formality. I'm Max.

05:35.815 --> 05:37.144
- Mark.
- Kerry.

05:37.359 --> 05:40.028
Could I stash my things?
Get a cup of coffee?

05:40.236 --> 05:42.643
Randi, could you show him the lounge?

05:42.863 --> 05:44.192
Sure.

05:45.031 --> 05:47.783
This comes from Doug Ross
lobbying upstairs.

05:47.993 --> 05:50.745
- It's just a study.
- You think he doesn't have an agenda?

05:50.955 --> 05:53.527
It's to fault how we handle
pediatric patients.

05:53.706 --> 05:56.873
We have nothing to hide.
We take great care of kids.

05:57.168 --> 05:59.919
- Jeanie, do you have a busy morning?
- Not so bad. Why?

06:00.129 --> 06:03.295
Our talk on managing abdominal pain
is next week.

06:03.506 --> 06:05.546
- Could you get the slides?
- Sure.

06:05.758 --> 06:07.170
Thank you.

06:26.068 --> 06:28.939
I warn you, if you don't see me
making the coffee...

06:29.154 --> 06:30.566
...I would avoid it.

06:31.739 --> 06:33.697
Mocha, vanilla, amaretto...

06:33.908 --> 06:36.577
It's my own very personal stock.

06:37.079 --> 06:38.737
Thanks. You're...?

06:38.954 --> 06:41.741
Randi,
acting Unit Service Coordinator.

06:42.332 --> 06:43.364
How's it going?

06:43.584 --> 06:44.697
Hi.

06:45.877 --> 06:47.337
Meeting everyone?

06:47.712 --> 06:49.040
Yeah.

06:50.214 --> 06:54.046
I encountered the usual dynamic.
The Attendings seeing me as the spy...

06:54.217 --> 06:56.010
...sent to undermine their authority.

06:58.013 --> 06:59.388
How are you doing?

07:00.015 --> 07:01.758
It's awkward, seeing you here.

07:02.225 --> 07:03.636
Was it awkward last night?

07:07.272 --> 07:08.302
No.

07:09.065 --> 07:10.227
No.

07:12.400 --> 07:13.860
But now you're nervous.

07:14.068 --> 07:15.812
I don't know.

07:16.404 --> 07:18.562
You show up
and you're back in my life.

07:18.782 --> 07:20.820
And it's not how I planned it.

07:21.033 --> 07:22.860
I never planned it any other way.

07:25.120 --> 07:26.745
- Peter?
- Yeah?

07:26.956 --> 07:29.243
Have you got a presentation
for morning report?

07:29.458 --> 07:31.331
Should I wait outside?

07:31.917 --> 07:33.496
When have you waited outside?

07:35.088 --> 07:38.670
You don't see me as a shy
English rose?

07:38.883 --> 07:41.799
Elizabeth, I see you as many things.

07:42.260 --> 07:44.169
Shy is not one of them.

07:44.888 --> 07:45.967
Busy morning?

07:46.348 --> 07:48.304
A parathyroidectomy.

07:48.516 --> 07:51.849
I know you like jazz. So I was
thinking maybe we could...

07:52.060 --> 07:55.975
...go to the Coq d'Or.
I hear the piano guy is pretty good.

07:56.190 --> 07:57.352
Sure. That'd be great.

07:57.565 --> 07:59.309
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

08:01.069 --> 08:02.100
Peter?

08:03.113 --> 08:06.196
Hi, Lizzie. Are we frequenting
the men's locker room?

08:07.449 --> 08:10.900
- Peter, interested in a pyloroplasty?
- I'm scrubbing in with Anspaugh.

08:11.119 --> 08:13.112
- Got it.
- Oh, I'm free.

08:13.621 --> 08:15.448
That's all right. I got a backup.

08:17.124 --> 08:18.832
Did he see us?

08:20.210 --> 08:21.586
I don't know.

08:22.213 --> 08:25.332
At least one exam room
with color murals and toys.

08:25.549 --> 08:29.083
And section chairs so kids
don't have to sit near a nut case.

08:29.303 --> 08:31.544
You favor setting up
a whole department?

08:31.762 --> 08:34.597
I'll get in trouble talking about
this in front of him...

08:34.807 --> 08:37.677
No need for caution on my account.
I'm keeping an open mind.

08:37.893 --> 08:39.553
A department would be great.

08:39.770 --> 08:42.010
But I'd settle
for a full-time Attending.

08:42.230 --> 08:44.138
That's the position Doug's out for.

08:44.357 --> 08:48.568
Who gets it isn't important.
I won't lie to you. I want the job.

08:48.736 --> 08:49.766
It's a problem?

08:49.987 --> 08:53.604
Set up Pedes and what's next?
Geriatric Emergency Medicine?

08:53.823 --> 08:55.650
Dr. Del Amico, meet Dr. Rosher.

08:55.868 --> 08:57.990
Stay on your toes.
He's doing a study.

08:58.202 --> 09:02.152
- I think she was born on her toes.
- Max was my Attending at CHoP.

09:02.332 --> 09:03.410
Another ally.

09:03.623 --> 09:05.996
I'm feeling outnumbered
by pediatricians.

09:06.210 --> 09:08.831
I'm double-boarded
in Emergency Medicine and Pedes.

09:09.004 --> 09:10.498
Dr. Rosher?

09:11.005 --> 09:14.089
I've got some charts that could be
relevant to your study.

09:14.466 --> 09:16.340
- Sure.
- I'll set you up in the lounge.

09:16.552 --> 09:18.711
Actually, I'm on a tour right now.

09:18.929 --> 09:21.680
I have time to go over them with you
right now.

09:21.890 --> 09:24.926
I'll see someone gets you
if any Pedes cases come in.

09:27.061 --> 09:28.555
One Tina-Marie Chambliss.

09:28.771 --> 09:29.850
Wouldn't give her age.

09:30.064 --> 09:33.099
Fever and facial erythema
following a face-lift.

09:33.317 --> 09:36.685
- She came by ambulance?
- It was a blepharo- and rhytidoplasty.

09:36.861 --> 09:37.892
A wound infection.

09:38.113 --> 09:41.529
Could she sign in under a
different name to avoid being mobbed?

09:41.741 --> 09:44.658
- Mobbed?
- Em, just let the doctors work.

09:45.036 --> 09:47.740
Ma'am, you're gonna have to
scoot on over here.

09:47.955 --> 09:50.242
- Em-
- Go on. You're in good hands.

09:51.708 --> 09:53.997
Ma'am, I am gonna have to examine
your face.

09:55.420 --> 09:57.578
I just look so awful.

09:57.797 --> 09:59.789
Emmet, stay by me. Don't leave me.

10:00.006 --> 10:03.340
I'm right here, sweetie.
Channeling my love to help you mend.

10:03.510 --> 10:06.380
- Temp's 102.
- Let's get a CBC...

10:06.554 --> 10:10.172
...blood cultures, start a line.
Do you have any allergies?

10:10.391 --> 10:13.974
She's allergic to sulfa antibiotics.
And to the ACE inhibitors.

10:14.186 --> 10:16.593
Dr. Emmet Chambliss, husband.
Charged with her care.

10:16.814 --> 10:19.304
You're her physician?
Doctor of Divinities.

10:19.524 --> 10:22.358
I'm diabetic.
You probably should know that.

10:22.568 --> 10:25.486
Malik, add a Chem-7.
Give her a gram of Ancef.

10:25.696 --> 10:26.859
Do you take insulin?

10:27.073 --> 10:30.939
24 of NPH with 10 of regular in the
morning. 12 of NPH, five at night.

10:31.160 --> 10:33.994
He gives me the shots.
I can't stand needles.

10:34.621 --> 10:36.779
- What're you putting on my face?
- Salt water.

10:36.998 --> 10:39.370
I hope it's not too harsh for my skin.

10:39.584 --> 10:42.703
This is the cleanser we normally use.
It's hypoallergenic.

10:43.254 --> 10:45.459
Dr. Del Amico,
you've got a handle on this.

10:45.964 --> 10:47.423
Yeah. Thanks.

10:48.383 --> 10:51.087
- What about our broadcast?
- Don't worry, honey.

10:51.261 --> 10:55.128
I can get a mobile truck and satellite
uplink with one phone call.

10:55.347 --> 10:56.806
But how long will I be sick?

10:57.015 --> 10:59.850
It's a serious infection.
You'll need IV antibiotics.

11:00.060 --> 11:02.099
Probably gonna be a couple of days.

11:04.272 --> 11:08.434
I've got a 2-year-old with rat bites.
Can we give him something for the pain?

11:08.650 --> 11:11.569
- I'll take a look at him.
- He's in Exam 2.

11:12.112 --> 11:14.686
- What's the weight?
-14 kilos.

11:15.114 --> 11:16.313
Hey.

11:16.992 --> 11:19.909
- When did this happen?
- About 6 a. m. They heard him scream.

11:25.582 --> 11:28.785
There were rats this big
biting his fingers, eating him.

11:28.961 --> 11:31.000
They thought he was
fighting with his brother.

11:31.213 --> 11:33.786
He's current on his vaccines
and tetanus.

11:36.509 --> 11:38.584
She says they attack all the children.

11:39.136 --> 11:42.754
Okay. We'll start an IV,
titrate morphine for his pain.

11:43.348 --> 11:46.598
It's through the palmar fascia.
Plastics should do it in the OR.

11:46.810 --> 11:48.089
Let's irrigate this wound.

11:48.853 --> 11:51.806
I'll get the authorities to
make sure there are no more rats.

11:57.819 --> 12:01.816
- He says they never do anything.
- Well, this time they will.

12:05.243 --> 12:07.863
- Hi, Bob.
- Hey, Jeanie. What's up?

12:08.454 --> 12:11.123
I had the flu and
I can't seem to shake a cough.

12:11.330 --> 12:14.083
We're seeing viral pneumonia.
You talk to a doc?

12:14.293 --> 12:16.581
I didn't want a big workup
for nothing.

12:17.087 --> 12:19.328
- You want a quick chest film?
- Could you?

12:19.630 --> 12:21.872
You know, two weeks ago
I cut my hand.

12:22.091 --> 12:24.131
I just wanted a few stitches.

12:24.343 --> 12:27.178
Next thing, I'm on a gurney
hooked to an IV for 6 hours.

12:27.346 --> 12:29.883
Some of these docs overreact.

12:35.519 --> 12:37.062
Should I flash your name?

12:37.272 --> 12:38.978
No. That's okay.

12:39.189 --> 12:41.347
No problem. No paperwork.
That's what I like.

12:45.194 --> 12:48.156
Take a deep breath and hold.

12:55.132 --> 12:58.169
You seen Dr. Rosher?
I got a 6-year-old with pityriasis.

12:58.385 --> 13:00.507
Dr. Weaver's holding him hostage.

13:00.720 --> 13:02.926
I gave him some reading material.

13:03.139 --> 13:05.546
We don't need to worry
about occupying his time.

13:05.766 --> 13:08.969
I want him to see how we work.
I'll get him out of there.

13:09.938 --> 13:12.179
Lizzie, meet Tancred Baumgartner, 64.

13:12.355 --> 13:15.807
History of hypertension and vascular
disease. 80-pack-year smoker.

13:15.984 --> 13:17.016
80-pack-years?

13:17.194 --> 13:19.946
- Two packs a day for 40 years.
- But I'm cutting back.

13:20.155 --> 13:22.028
I'm gonna get hypnotized.

13:22.240 --> 13:26.487
- So, what brought you in today?
- Terrible pain in my legs.

13:26.703 --> 13:28.198
How far can you walk?

13:28.371 --> 13:32.203
Six months ago I could walk two blocks
before I had to rest.

13:32.375 --> 13:36.704
Now he can't walk to the toilet.
He's scheduled for a fem-pop bypass.

13:36.880 --> 13:38.504
You should review his films.

13:38.714 --> 13:42.415
Don't worry, Mr. Baumgartner.
We'll put a spring back in your step.

13:44.554 --> 13:46.095
I've been meaning to ask you.

13:46.305 --> 13:49.389
Given more thought to that
impressive offer you got recently?

13:49.600 --> 13:52.137
- Which impressive offer?
- There's been more?

13:52.352 --> 13:56.136
The Senior Lecturer position
at the Gloucestershire Royal Hospital.

13:56.356 --> 13:58.147
- I decided to pass.
- Really?

13:58.357 --> 14:00.398
- Did you let them know?
- I wrote them.

14:00.568 --> 14:01.600
- Ouch!
- What?

14:01.777 --> 14:03.854
Well, it takes guts, Lizzie.

14:04.072 --> 14:06.029
You don't know if you have
a future here.

14:07.867 --> 14:11.567
And have him lay flat on his back
for the next two hours.

14:11.786 --> 14:15.073
- I'll hand-carry the specimens.
- Yeah, I'd appreciate that.

14:15.290 --> 14:18.410
- Kerry, would you take a look at this?
- Sure.

14:18.627 --> 14:21.581
Oh, and don't forget
to get a Gram's stain.

14:22.256 --> 14:23.370
What do you got?

14:23.590 --> 14:27.089
31-year-old woman with a three-week
dry cough and intermittent fever.

14:27.261 --> 14:29.004
- Is she a smoker?
- No.

14:29.220 --> 14:31.758
- Any travel outside the country?
- I don't think so.

14:31.973 --> 14:34.097
Did you ask about her HIV status?

14:34.309 --> 14:36.467
I don't know if she's been tested.
Why?

14:37.521 --> 14:40.058
Might be an early infiltrate
at the right base.

14:40.273 --> 14:43.273
Or it may just be atelectasis.

14:43.484 --> 14:45.773
- Where's the lateral?
- That's all we have.

14:46.111 --> 14:49.730
Repeat the film and have her take
a deeper breath. And get a lateral.

14:49.949 --> 14:51.359
Also there's no name.

14:51.575 --> 14:54.611
Let the techs know that that's
really unacceptable.

14:54.828 --> 14:57.450
- And Jeanie, the slides?
- Sorry?

14:57.747 --> 15:01.246
This morning I asked you
to get the slides. Did you forget?

15:01.459 --> 15:03.167
No, I haven't had the time.

15:03.378 --> 15:05.584
- Should someone else do it?
- I'll get them now.

15:05.755 --> 15:06.787
Okay.

15:11.010 --> 15:12.291
We need some help!

15:12.469 --> 15:16.218
We were visiting my folks in Saint
Lioba. Our son just passed out.

15:16.390 --> 15:17.421
- Gurney!
- Got it.

15:17.641 --> 15:18.839
Here, Malik.

15:19.560 --> 15:22.050
- We'll need high-flow oxygen in 2.
- I'll get it.

15:22.271 --> 15:24.227
- History of heart disease?
- No.

15:24.439 --> 15:26.895
- On any medications?
- He's perfectly healthy.

15:27.109 --> 15:30.026
He never gets sick. My God!
What's wrong with him?!

15:31.821 --> 15:33.613
He's tachy at 150.

15:33.782 --> 15:34.813
Resps high at 28.

15:34.991 --> 15:36.534
Why is he breathing so fast?

15:36.743 --> 15:38.652
- Does he have asthma?
- No.

15:38.827 --> 15:41.449
All right, Conni.
Put him on a pulse ox and EKG.

15:41.663 --> 15:46.326
I want a CBC, Chem-7, blood gas,
chest film. I'll start a line.

15:46.544 --> 15:48.750
Sam? Sam, can you hear me?

15:48.962 --> 15:50.586
- What's wrong?
- He's cyanotic.

15:50.797 --> 15:52.291
See how blue his lips are?

15:52.508 --> 15:54.417
- He's not getting enough oxygen.
- Why?

15:54.634 --> 15:56.342
That's what we'll figure out.

16:00.932 --> 16:01.963
How are you doing?

16:02.184 --> 16:05.848
- Just trying to look decent again.
- I don't think that's a good idea.

16:06.563 --> 16:10.512
I can't be seen on TV
without my woolly bears and make-up.

16:10.691 --> 16:12.815
- You ever see us on the JGCN?
- No.

16:13.028 --> 16:14.521
Jesus Gospel Cable Network?

16:14.736 --> 16:16.943
Makeup'll make it worse,
Mrs. Chambliss.

16:17.113 --> 16:19.439
Oh, no.
Honey, you call me Tina-Marie.

16:19.950 --> 16:22.108
Hello, doctor. Isn't she an angel?

16:22.537 --> 16:24.907
I see the power of prayer
and modern medicine.

16:25.122 --> 16:29.167
Well, we have her blood test results.
And there is reason for concern.

16:30.000 --> 16:31.032
My face?

16:31.461 --> 16:33.832
Actually, your kidneys
are the problem.

16:34.172 --> 16:35.287
I'm passing water.

16:35.506 --> 16:38.840
Your BUN and creatinine are elevated,
indicating kidney problems.

16:39.010 --> 16:41.132
- Probably from your diabetes.
- Emmet?

16:42.304 --> 16:44.178
Doctor, what does this exactly mean?

16:44.390 --> 16:46.715
It could simply be dehydration.

16:46.933 --> 16:48.677
I'll give you IV fluids...

16:49.103 --> 16:51.475
...and hope your renal function
improves.

16:51.689 --> 16:54.642
I'll also do a neuro exam for
sensation in your extremities.

16:55.025 --> 16:56.483
Whatever suits you, honey.

16:57.361 --> 16:58.476
Feel that?

16:59.154 --> 17:00.696
Little pricks of pain.

17:01.489 --> 17:02.604
That's good.

17:02.825 --> 17:05.779
That means you're not losing feeling
in your feet and toes.

17:06.161 --> 17:09.078
Look out, Emmet.
She might test your heart.

17:10.372 --> 17:12.200
I'm just kidding, sweetie.

17:12.375 --> 17:13.405
Just kidding.

17:13.626 --> 17:16.032
So if my kidneys fail...

17:16.211 --> 17:17.242
...what then?

17:18.172 --> 17:21.375
If it progresses to renal failure,
you'll need dialysis.

17:22.593 --> 17:24.550
This means a full prayer vigil,
Emmet!

17:24.762 --> 17:26.718
Yes, we'll pray for those kidneys!

17:26.930 --> 17:30.975
Malik, know anyone in Public Health
to deal with a rat problem?

17:31.184 --> 17:33.675
- Office for Rodent Control.
- I got a contact there.

17:33.894 --> 17:36.682
- I'll put you through.
- They were eating this kid alive.

17:36.856 --> 17:39.726
In Philly, Animal Control was better
than Public Health.

17:39.942 --> 17:42.433
This woman, Miss Weldon,
is a real crusader.

17:43.321 --> 17:46.985
She'll get them in there. Poison,
traps, whatever they have to do.

17:47.199 --> 17:50.153
Dr. Greene? Dr. Carter wants
to see you in Trauma 2.

17:50.369 --> 17:51.650
Thanks, Yosh. Here.

17:51.870 --> 17:53.946
Mention my name.
I treated her son once.

17:54.164 --> 17:57.450
Come on. You picked a good day
for Pedes cases.

17:57.667 --> 17:59.494
He seems a little better.

17:59.711 --> 18:00.873
Why won't he wake up?

18:01.087 --> 18:03.245
- Isn't the oxygen helping?
- It's helping.

18:03.465 --> 18:06.667
And for now, he's stable.
I just haven't found what's wrong.

18:06.885 --> 18:09.042
- Dr. Carter, meet Dr. Rosher.
- We've met.

18:09.262 --> 18:11.053
- Yep. Hi.
- What do you got?

18:11.222 --> 18:13.713
This is Sam Adams, 11 years old,
altered.

18:13.933 --> 18:16.554
Presented with cyanosis,
tachypnea, tachycardia...

18:16.768 --> 18:20.766
...driving back from the farm.
Still cyanotic despite O2, 10 liters.

18:20.982 --> 18:22.309
What are you thinking?

18:23.066 --> 18:25.356
Either a VQ mismatch or something...

18:25.568 --> 18:26.813
...toxic-metabolic?

18:27.029 --> 18:28.902
- Pulse ox?
-92. It's pretty good.

18:29.071 --> 18:32.487
- Was he in a camper or a pickup?
- He was in a car with us.

18:33.326 --> 18:35.450
- Chest and cardiac exam?
- No wheezing or rales.

18:35.661 --> 18:37.821
Regular without murmur, rub or gallop.

18:38.039 --> 18:41.289
- Blood gas?
- PCO2's 35. PO2's 380.

18:41.501 --> 18:45.284
- Suggesting...
- Oxygen in blood, but still cyanotic.

18:45.504 --> 18:48.126
- What kind of farm was it?
- My father raises tulips.

18:48.341 --> 18:50.713
- Greenhouses.
- I already asked about that.

18:50.968 --> 18:53.969
Some of the pesticides in a hothouse
contain cyanide.

18:54.180 --> 18:56.088
He'd have pinked up
with the oxygen.

18:56.306 --> 18:59.259
Besides, I've got good pulses
and there's no smell of almonds.

18:59.476 --> 19:01.552
So your best educated guess?

19:01.936 --> 19:03.311
Methemoglobinemia.

19:03.605 --> 19:05.561
Do another blood gas. Check that.

19:05.773 --> 19:07.148
Go for it.

19:08.735 --> 19:10.692
Tough case, leaving it with an intern.

19:10.904 --> 19:11.982
Is it ill-advised?

19:12.195 --> 19:15.482
- You know Dr. Carter. I don't.
- He just figured it out.

19:15.657 --> 19:18.362
Diagnosis was correct.
But you didn't tell him.

19:18.577 --> 19:20.653
He's here to learn. Not to be told.

19:20.871 --> 19:22.994
Is that a mark against me?

19:23.332 --> 19:24.660
Not in my book.

19:24.875 --> 19:28.456
-500 cc fluid bolus is onboard.
- TKO the line.

19:28.670 --> 19:29.785
Okay. I got it.

19:31.465 --> 19:32.495
There it is.

19:32.716 --> 19:33.914
There's the answer.

19:34.133 --> 19:35.757
Look at that arterial blood.

19:36.344 --> 19:38.217
That's blood? Looks like chocolate.

19:38.429 --> 19:40.138
- It's methemoglobin.
- What?

19:40.348 --> 19:43.218
A form of hemoglobin
that can't carry oxygen into the body.

19:43.393 --> 19:44.424
How'd he get that?

19:44.644 --> 19:46.802
From a drug or toxin.
We can treat it.

19:47.021 --> 19:49.594
Take that to the lab
and bring back methylene blue.

19:49.940 --> 19:51.139
Peter.

19:51.359 --> 19:53.398
Hey. I thought you had a fem-pop?

19:53.611 --> 19:57.857
Done. I'm assisting on a lung
biopsy, then on a triple A.

19:58.031 --> 20:00.783
Look, I think Romano saw us.

20:00.993 --> 20:02.735
- What did he say?
- You know him.

20:02.952 --> 20:04.530
He didn't say it directly.

20:04.746 --> 20:07.995
But he told me I should've accepted
the position at the Royal.

20:08.207 --> 20:11.825
He was saying he wasn't going
to continue my sponsorship.

20:12.044 --> 20:14.500
I suppose it's a matter of insult
to injury.

20:14.713 --> 20:16.255
Because he came on to you?

20:16.465 --> 20:18.588
Peter, the man has an elephantine ego.

20:18.801 --> 20:20.710
I'm not going for that.

20:20.886 --> 20:22.428
Maybe it was inevitable.

20:22.638 --> 20:26.221
Being sponsored by him was difficult
at the best of times.

20:26.809 --> 20:28.551
Elizabeth, listen to me.

20:28.768 --> 20:31.473
He doesn't own you.
He can't do this, okay?

20:31.938 --> 20:33.896
We'll talk later. I have to scrub.

20:34.066 --> 20:35.180
Yeah.

20:38.194 --> 20:40.899
We'll explore to see
if there's flexor tendon injury.

20:41.113 --> 20:43.735
Chuny, take the parents
to the waiting room.

20:43.950 --> 20:46.072
See if Pedes
has a post-op bed assignment.

20:46.285 --> 20:48.740
- Doug, Dr. Nagarwala's here.
- All right.

20:48.954 --> 20:50.746
- What's up?
- Sorry to bother you...

20:50.956 --> 20:53.245
...but a woman came from DCFS,
a Miss Neuman.

20:53.459 --> 20:55.581
She said the case status
had changed...

20:55.794 --> 20:57.916
...and she's taking Josh
back to his mother.

20:58.088 --> 20:59.203
- When?
- Just now.

20:59.422 --> 21:00.916
I came down when she left.

21:01.090 --> 21:04.459
None of the doctors agree.
We're going to make a formal appeal.

21:04.677 --> 21:06.385
No, there's no time for that.

21:06.597 --> 21:09.217
I need the County Health Department
in Saint Lioba.

21:09.432 --> 21:11.341
Home of the White Corn Festival.

21:11.559 --> 21:15.176
I went there with bikers once.
They had pig-calling. Ever see that?

21:15.396 --> 21:16.427
Can't say I have.

21:16.606 --> 21:18.847
When you get that number,
will you page me?

21:19.066 --> 21:20.442
How's it going?

21:20.609 --> 21:23.813
- I got a kid with methemoglobinemia.
- That's a great case.

21:24.029 --> 21:25.274
What was the inducer?

21:25.489 --> 21:27.031
Tox screen was negative.

21:27.198 --> 21:28.230
But he was on a farm.

21:28.450 --> 21:31.653
So I'm getting the local health
authorities to check it out.

21:31.953 --> 21:34.788
- Are you taking care of Tina-Marie?
- Yes.

21:34.956 --> 21:36.035
My mom watches them...

21:36.249 --> 21:40.661
...and she said they announced they're
broadcasting live and she's dying.

21:40.878 --> 21:43.584
- No, that is not happening.
- She's not dying?

21:43.797 --> 21:47.296
No, and they're not broadcasting
from here. Dr. Greene said no way.

21:47.468 --> 21:50.220
She and my aunt are by the TV
with their credit cards.

21:50.429 --> 21:52.303
Talking about those televangelists?

21:52.473 --> 21:55.308
- Yeah, Dr. Emmet and Tina-Marie.
- They have some clout.

21:55.518 --> 21:57.474
I just got a call from
Administration...

21:57.686 --> 22:00.473
...saying we're to let them
do a broadcast.

22:01.690 --> 22:02.888
Adele?

22:03.108 --> 22:04.732
Hey, Adele!

22:05.860 --> 22:08.232
Hey, you're tough to catch up to.

22:08.446 --> 22:10.569
- Josh is my patient.
- I read the report.

22:10.781 --> 22:12.360
You know
the situation with his mother.

22:12.575 --> 22:15.660
Sure, but there's been a change
in the environment.

22:15.828 --> 22:17.701
His mother now lives with her aunt.

22:17.914 --> 22:20.451
We feel that the aunt
can take care of Josh.

22:20.666 --> 22:22.908
- He's addicted to methadone.
- I know his medical history.

22:23.127 --> 22:25.000
But my obligation
is to return the child.

22:25.212 --> 22:27.204
- Can you hold this?
- Yeah.

22:28.340 --> 22:30.378
We'll carefully monitor his progress.

22:30.592 --> 22:32.252
We understand the situation.

22:32.469 --> 22:35.174
As long as he needs methadone,
she'll steal it from him.

22:36.390 --> 22:38.381
I'm sorry. He has to go home.

22:40.017 --> 22:42.509
Okay, how is the aunt
gonna pay for the meds?

22:42.688 --> 22:44.015
- He's on Medicaid.
- Okay.

22:44.230 --> 22:48.691
Some of the meds are formulary. I'll
have to fill out an authorization.

22:48.901 --> 22:50.858
- Dr. Ross-
- We examine him...

22:51.070 --> 22:52.445
...and give him everything.

22:52.655 --> 22:54.363
How long is this gonna take?

22:54.531 --> 22:56.607
Just long enough
to fill out some forms.

22:58.118 --> 23:00.359
- Here we go. Come on.
- Okay.

23:00.579 --> 23:01.610
Okay, come here.

23:01.830 --> 23:03.621
- I got him.
- All right.

23:04.332 --> 23:07.286
Just give me a second
to lock up my car.

23:07.501 --> 23:08.581
Here we go.

23:08.753 --> 23:10.875
- Come on. Got it?
- Got everything.

23:11.047 --> 23:13.057
Okay, here we go.

23:15.883 --> 23:18.634
All right, Josh.
Deep breaths for me.

23:19.971 --> 23:22.343
I'm hearing basilar rales on the left.

23:22.557 --> 23:25.392
Get a CBC, blood culture
and a chest film.

23:25.602 --> 23:28.389
- Why? What's wrong?
- Could be pneumonia.

23:28.647 --> 23:30.769
- Pneumonia?
- Want to hear for yourself?

23:31.441 --> 23:34.775
What do I say to the mother?
How long does he have to stay?

23:34.987 --> 23:36.896
Four hours for test results.

23:37.115 --> 23:39.688
If it is, we'll put him on IV antibiotics.

23:39.909 --> 23:41.700
That means he'll spend the night?

23:41.911 --> 23:43.240
Could be, yeah.

23:45.832 --> 23:47.031
Okay.

23:47.208 --> 23:48.489
All right.

23:50.545 --> 23:53.002
Kid looks pretty good. No fever.

23:53.507 --> 23:54.787
You sure you heard rales?

23:55.009 --> 23:56.753
There's no rales. I'm keeping him.

23:57.053 --> 23:58.083
What's going on?

23:58.929 --> 24:01.966
We got a 7-month-old baby
admitted twice for withdrawal.

24:02.183 --> 24:05.635
I'm not sending him home to be a
methadone source for his mother.

24:05.854 --> 24:09.389
- Can't Child Services take care of it?
- I'll do an ultrarapid detox...

24:09.567 --> 24:11.060
...and end his addiction today.

24:11.276 --> 24:15.226
- Ultrarapid? What does that mean?
- Quick withdrawal under deep sedation.

24:15.531 --> 24:17.653
He's going cold turkey right here?

24:17.866 --> 24:19.943
I spoke to a pediatric anesthesiologist.

24:20.161 --> 24:22.486
I know the procedure.
It can be done safely.

24:22.705 --> 24:23.903
How long will it take?

24:24.373 --> 24:25.785
12 to 18 hours.

24:26.584 --> 24:28.873
You're gonna hide him here
for 12 hours?

24:29.087 --> 24:30.202
I don't have a choice.

24:36.095 --> 24:38.586
- You can't do it alone.
- Yes, I can.

24:38.805 --> 24:41.344
- No, you can't.
- Don't put anything at risk.

24:41.559 --> 24:43.267
Yeah. Well, if we get caught...

24:43.477 --> 24:46.349
...we'll both help each other
through real-estate school.

24:51.319 --> 24:54.237
Put him on cardiac monitor and
pulse ox. I'll do an arterial line.

24:54.448 --> 24:56.405
We'll need a ventilator. Okay?

24:57.533 --> 24:58.566
Okay.

24:59.952 --> 25:01.578
Here's the second dose.

25:01.788 --> 25:03.781
Let's run that over five minutes.

25:05.835 --> 25:07.163
How you doing?

25:07.503 --> 25:10.789
I feel a bit tired,
but otherwise I'm okay.

25:12.217 --> 25:13.841
Are my mom and dad around?

25:14.260 --> 25:16.834
Yeah. They went to go
make some phone calls.

25:17.055 --> 25:18.300
I can go get them.

25:19.600 --> 25:21.142
No hurry.

25:24.563 --> 25:26.769
How is your patient?
Aside from his color?

25:26.982 --> 25:28.014
He's improving.

25:28.192 --> 25:29.734
Good call, John.

25:29.944 --> 25:32.898
Gotta figure out its cause.
See who else is at risk.

25:33.114 --> 25:35.321
I've heard a lot about you from Anna.

25:35.701 --> 25:36.980
- Really?
- Yeah.

25:37.202 --> 25:39.574
She told me you've become
close friends.

25:39.788 --> 25:42.659
I heard about your cousin.
I'm sure she was a big help.

25:42.874 --> 25:44.369
She told you about that?

25:44.585 --> 25:46.873
- You know Anna doesn't keep secrets.
- Yeah.

25:47.088 --> 25:50.005
I don't really see
how that concerns you, though.

25:50.258 --> 25:53.009
Well, what she's learned
about drug addiction...

25:53.219 --> 25:55.889
...she had the misfortune to learn
through me, John.

25:56.180 --> 25:58.339
I know it's private.
I meant no offense.

25:58.517 --> 26:00.308
No, forget it.

26:04.023 --> 26:05.221
- Dr. Romano.
- Peter.

26:05.441 --> 26:08.644
You're a "dried fruits and nuts" guy.
Nothing healthy here.

26:08.862 --> 26:10.190
I was looking for you.

26:10.362 --> 26:11.394
You found me.

26:11.614 --> 26:13.607
- You don't mind if I eat?
- No.

26:13.825 --> 26:15.154
So, what's up?

26:15.368 --> 26:17.859
What Elizabeth and I do
in our personal lives...

26:18.080 --> 26:19.739
...should not impact her career.

26:20.332 --> 26:22.657
In your personal lives. What's that?

26:22.876 --> 26:25.249
You saw us in the lockers,
then hinted...

26:25.463 --> 26:28.167
...that she won't receive
sponsorship next year.

26:28.383 --> 26:30.340
Now, we both know that's not right.

26:31.428 --> 26:35.591
Look, I had no idea you and Lizzie
were an item. I swear I didn't.

26:36.182 --> 26:38.852
But don't worry.
I mean, I'm happy for you.

26:39.143 --> 26:40.555
So you didn't see us?

26:41.188 --> 26:43.892
No. But you're having an affair.
Terrific.

26:44.066 --> 26:45.892
It puts things in perspective.

26:47.402 --> 26:48.483
Hey.

26:50.239 --> 26:51.438
Congratulations.

26:51.657 --> 26:52.902
Excellent choice.

27:03.378 --> 27:05.086
- Need help?
- No, I got it.

27:05.297 --> 27:07.290
- Who needs a vent?
- Nobody.

27:07.507 --> 27:09.915
Respiratory called.
They need it upstairs.

27:10.135 --> 27:11.167
Mr. Chambliss.

27:11.387 --> 27:12.418
Dr. Chambliss.

27:12.638 --> 27:15.758
I want you to know I think
this broadcast is inappropriate.

27:15.974 --> 27:20.685
I assure you, as I did Public Affairs,
you'll be referred to positively.

27:20.897 --> 27:23.814
Dr. Del Amico? Stay in the room
during the broadcast...

27:24.025 --> 27:28.106
...and if you feel Mrs. Chambliss'
health is being compromised, call me.

27:28.322 --> 27:29.352
No problem.

27:29.573 --> 27:30.736
A little help here!

27:30.950 --> 27:32.230
I got it.

27:33.035 --> 27:34.066
What do we got?

27:34.287 --> 27:35.781
Cylla Voliotis, age 12.

27:35.954 --> 27:39.620
Blunt trauma to the right eye,
concussion, possible facial fracture.

27:39.792 --> 27:41.073
Let's go to Trauma 1.

27:41.295 --> 27:43.333
- You the mother?
- No, Phys Ed teacher.

27:43.547 --> 27:46.085
She was running and hit a lamppost.

27:46.299 --> 27:48.008
The school call the mother?

27:48.218 --> 27:50.792
They're trying, but I have
an emergency consent form.

27:51.014 --> 27:52.970
Good. Good. Okay, nice and easy.

27:53.140 --> 27:56.176
On my count. One, two, three...

27:56.394 --> 27:58.552
- It hurts so bad!
- I know. Don't worry.

27:58.771 --> 28:00.646
- We'll take care of you.
- Morphine?

28:00.815 --> 28:02.143
Let's start with four.

28:02.358 --> 28:04.731
- Partially extruded globe.
- She have vision?

28:04.944 --> 28:07.270
- Can you see, darling?
- It's all red and blurry.

28:07.489 --> 28:09.696
- How many fingers am I holding up?
- Three.

28:09.908 --> 28:11.284
Good. Good.

28:11.493 --> 28:13.616
Iris and lens are intact.

28:13.829 --> 28:15.371
No vitreous hemorrhage...

28:15.581 --> 28:17.621
...or detached retina.

28:18.334 --> 28:21.785
Okay.
Let's get 1 percent lidocaine.

28:22.004 --> 28:23.997
With that, Betadine and a Steri-Drape.

28:24.216 --> 28:25.591
No Ophtho consult?

28:25.800 --> 28:28.088
No, we've done this before.

28:30.848 --> 28:32.341
All right, he's out.

28:32.557 --> 28:34.053
Let's tube him.

28:35.560 --> 28:37.767
How do we know
when withdrawal's complete?

28:38.063 --> 28:41.479
After 12 hours of the Narcan
blocking the narcotic...

28:41.692 --> 28:43.733
...about a 98 percent success rate.

28:44.237 --> 28:47.274
When he wakes up, he shouldn't have
withdrawal symptoms. I'm in.

28:48.408 --> 28:49.487
Pulse ox 98.

28:49.701 --> 28:50.733
BP?

28:51.077 --> 28:53.117
110/70.

28:55.373 --> 28:56.868
Good breath. Heart rate?

28:57.876 --> 29:00.368
120. He's a little tachy.

29:01.213 --> 29:03.336
Let him settle down a bit.

29:03.842 --> 29:05.419
How's it going, Cylla?

29:05.635 --> 29:07.379
I'm scared.

29:07.594 --> 29:09.138
Alcaine's in.

29:12.225 --> 29:14.348
- You feel that?
- What?

29:14.852 --> 29:16.930
I think we're about ready to go.

29:17.148 --> 29:19.604
So, what kind of music do you like?

29:19.817 --> 29:20.895
Spice Girls.

29:21.109 --> 29:22.853
Who's your favorite Spice?

29:23.071 --> 29:24.612
Yosh, methyl cellulose.

29:24.822 --> 29:28.191
What is it? Sporty Spice,
All Spice...

29:28.409 --> 29:30.153
...Cylla Spice?

29:30.786 --> 29:32.696
No, I like Posh.

29:32.915 --> 29:34.112
Okay, good.

29:34.332 --> 29:36.206
I need you just to hold still.

29:36.418 --> 29:37.532
Okay, hold still.

29:42.383 --> 29:45.053
- Sterile applicator.
- Here you go.

29:45.428 --> 29:47.716
I'm just gonna evert the lashes.

29:53.353 --> 29:54.432
There.

29:56.773 --> 29:58.731
I can see a little better.

29:59.860 --> 30:01.140
Yosh, eye shield.

30:03.573 --> 30:06.194
It's gonna be a little blurry
for a while...

30:06.409 --> 30:07.523
...and a little sore.

30:07.994 --> 30:10.033
Let me know when her parents arrive.

30:10.454 --> 30:12.447
She'll need an orbital CT...

30:12.624 --> 30:14.949
...and Ophtho can see her.

30:15.168 --> 30:17.244
Praise the Lord, yes!

30:17.462 --> 30:20.036
Praise him for his blessing...

30:20.257 --> 30:22.297
...prompted by your prayers
and offerings.

30:22.510 --> 30:24.751
It is only by your faith...

30:24.970 --> 30:28.138
...that I will survive my ordeal.

30:28.807 --> 30:30.599
Only hours ago...

30:30.935 --> 30:33.640
...when pain coursed through me...

30:36.191 --> 30:37.222
Emmet...

30:38.777 --> 30:40.770
Emmet, you tell them.

30:41.279 --> 30:45.148
Brothers and sisters, the Lord
has put another trial before us.

30:45.367 --> 30:47.823
Tina-Marie just learned
from this lovely lady-

30:48.037 --> 30:49.579
No, she's not a movie star.

30:49.789 --> 30:51.532
This is Tina-Marie's doctor.

30:51.750 --> 30:54.322
Will you tell us the nature
of her illness?

30:54.544 --> 30:57.580
She has cellulitis
and renal insufficiency.

30:57.839 --> 31:00.674
And what does that mean?

31:01.301 --> 31:03.626
She has a problem with her kidneys.

31:03.845 --> 31:05.720
- But she will survive?
- Yes.

31:05.931 --> 31:09.135
Yes! She will survive
through the power of Christ Jesus...

31:09.352 --> 31:11.179
...and by your prayers and offerings.

31:11.395 --> 31:12.558
Emmet, Emmet, Emmet!

31:12.772 --> 31:16.556
I can feel the power of prayer
right now!

31:16.775 --> 31:19.019
I can feel it! It has started!

31:19.237 --> 31:20.435
We all feel it, honey.

31:20.655 --> 31:22.530
Do you feel it, doctor?

31:22.866 --> 31:24.693
- No.
- Well, come on.

31:24.910 --> 31:26.819
Here, take Tina-Marie's hand.

31:27.037 --> 31:30.702
We will have a prayer interface.

31:30.916 --> 31:33.490
People are watching
and waiting for you, honey.

31:33.961 --> 31:34.992
Yes?

31:35.213 --> 31:39.425
Feel the power of the love
that courses through us.

31:39.634 --> 31:41.544
God, through you...

31:41.761 --> 31:44.050
...will save my life!

31:44.973 --> 31:46.550
Kerry?

31:46.766 --> 31:48.226
Got another set of x-rays.

31:48.435 --> 31:49.894
Let's have a look.

31:54.734 --> 31:56.311
Is there a name on these?

31:56.527 --> 31:57.808
They're mine.

31:59.572 --> 32:01.482
These are much better images.

32:01.699 --> 32:03.776
- Did you look at these?
- No.

32:06.079 --> 32:07.703
Well, it looks clean.

32:08.957 --> 32:11.663
- Why'd you order them? Cough? Fever?
- Yeah.

32:11.878 --> 32:14.333
- Night sweats?
- No, but I have trouble sleeping.

32:14.547 --> 32:16.089
Forgetfulness?

32:16.256 --> 32:18.879
Those slides,
I put in your mailbox. But...

32:19.094 --> 32:21.050
...yeah, there's been forgetfulness.

32:23.432 --> 32:25.508
I want you to know something.

32:25.725 --> 32:29.225
Whatever your status, even if you have
a measurable viral count...

32:29.438 --> 32:31.477
...no one's going to overreact.

32:31.941 --> 32:34.017
There's going to be a job for you here.

32:38.072 --> 32:39.816
We should draw some blood.

32:41.535 --> 32:43.776
- He didn't see us?
- That's what he claims.

32:43.995 --> 32:46.153
I misread him,
and you told him about us.

32:46.373 --> 32:50.785
I told him that nothing we do
should affect your standing here.

32:51.003 --> 32:52.413
You got heavy with him?

32:52.629 --> 32:53.745
Yeah.

32:54.632 --> 32:57.087
Maybe I should've kept my mouth shut.

32:57.301 --> 32:59.922
Taking up my cause
was very gallant of you, Peter.

33:00.137 --> 33:02.296
But it seems we've gone public.

33:08.063 --> 33:11.064
- Good breath sounds bilaterally.
- Heart rate's down to 100.

33:11.275 --> 33:13.267
- Pulse ox 99.
- He's stable.

33:13.485 --> 33:16.936
Start a second line and be ready
before we give him the Narcan.

33:17.156 --> 33:20.360
- Are there gonna be side effects?
- It'll make him hypertensive.

33:20.576 --> 33:24.527
We have Nipride, but no esmolol.
I want to have both ready on drips.

33:24.748 --> 33:26.740
- I'll go get them.
- No. I'll do it.

33:26.958 --> 33:30.243
Kerry Weaver might wonder
why you're here after your shift.

33:31.922 --> 33:33.120
Suction.

33:34.675 --> 33:36.466
Lizzie, can you retract distally?

33:39.471 --> 33:41.796
Good. I got the room I need.

33:42.015 --> 33:45.384
Now we can all settle back.
Shirley, let me ask you something.

33:46.020 --> 33:48.060
Suppose you asked someone on a date-

33:48.232 --> 33:49.262
I'm married.

33:49.482 --> 33:51.522
Hypothetically. It's a long procedure.

33:51.692 --> 33:55.856
You ask them out and they beg off,
claiming they don't get involved...

33:56.031 --> 33:57.609
...with work colleagues.

33:57.825 --> 33:59.484
- Got some oozing.
- Got it.

33:59.744 --> 34:02.911
Then you find out they're having
an affair with a colleague.

34:03.122 --> 34:05.529
Now, why do you suppose they lied?

34:05.750 --> 34:07.126
The colleague is married.

34:07.335 --> 34:10.335
Married person's response.
But say he's not married.

34:10.547 --> 34:12.871
They didn't want to offend
an overblown ego.

34:13.091 --> 34:14.206
It's a thought.

34:14.427 --> 34:17.094
But suppose this person
made up that story...

34:17.304 --> 34:19.676
...about keeping sex and work
separate...

34:19.891 --> 34:22.013
...so they could continue
playing the field.

34:22.226 --> 34:24.514
That's absurd. Clamp again.
Right here.

34:24.936 --> 34:26.562
I don't know. Shirley?

34:26.898 --> 34:29.899
I agree. They're probably
still shopping around.

34:36.909 --> 34:39.234
- Your shift ended hours ago.
- I got involved.

34:39.411 --> 34:41.737
- Esmolol?
- Teenager with a tachy arrhythmia.

34:41.955 --> 34:44.328
- How about adenosine?
- I already tried it.

34:44.541 --> 34:47.786
Lasted for a few seconds.
It's under control.

34:52.992 --> 34:56.196
Dr. Carter, I just got this fax for you.

35:00.168 --> 35:02.920
This is the explanation
for the methemoglobinemia.

35:03.087 --> 35:04.119
Really?

35:04.339 --> 35:07.091
It's from a local health service
near the farm.

35:07.301 --> 35:10.421
"Ground water from several areas
has been found...

35:10.639 --> 35:14.637
...to have heavy nitrite concentration
from inorganic waste contamination. "

35:14.852 --> 35:16.844
Test the parents.
They might be borderline.

35:17.021 --> 35:20.472
Yeah. I did that already.
I'm just waiting on the test results.

35:22.736 --> 35:24.978
- Are the labs back on Chambliss?
- Here.

35:25.197 --> 35:26.526
Thank you.

35:28.660 --> 35:30.700
Pedes case? I'll put it in my study.

35:30.912 --> 35:34.614
Sorry. It's a repeat glucose
on the televangelist.

35:35.001 --> 35:37.622
- I heard you look great on TV.
- Someone saw me?

35:37.838 --> 35:42.298
- The nurses had it on in the lounge.
- What a nightmare! Total frauds.

35:42.509 --> 35:45.179
Not serious?
But I phoned in a big pledge!

35:45.388 --> 35:47.547
The woman used her disease...

35:47.724 --> 35:51.176
...to milk money out of poor people
who probably believe all of it.

35:51.395 --> 35:54.396
It's a living.
At least they're not practicing law...

35:54.607 --> 35:56.849
...or polluting streams,
selling insurance...

35:57.068 --> 36:00.568
What's the deal on getting
a genuine Philly cheese steak?

36:00.739 --> 36:02.696
I've looked. They don't exist.

36:02.908 --> 36:04.902
Italian?
I'm on a substantial per diem.

36:05.078 --> 36:06.192
And I'm on call.

36:06.412 --> 36:09.579
Chinese? How about
a candlelit dinner in the lounge?

36:09.749 --> 36:10.782
I'd love to.

36:11.669 --> 36:13.542
Jeanie, could I see you?

36:13.922 --> 36:15.250
Sure, Kerry.

36:15.673 --> 36:17.298
You can go. I'll bandage him.

36:17.509 --> 36:18.968
Thanks, Yosh.

36:23.808 --> 36:25.682
I got your labs back.

36:25.893 --> 36:28.467
I'm very happy to say
it's all good news.

36:28.688 --> 36:31.442
Your viral load remains
non-detectable...

36:31.651 --> 36:34.818
...your white count's normal
and you're not even anemic.

36:36.364 --> 36:38.358
Guess I was worked up over nothing.

36:38.575 --> 36:40.284
I can understand.

36:40.828 --> 36:43.616
But I took responsibility
for monitoring your health.

36:43.789 --> 36:46.281
You shouldn't be on your own
looking at x-rays.

36:46.459 --> 36:48.950
Yeah, you're right.
That won't happen again.

36:49.129 --> 36:51.337
What about the forgetfulness?

36:51.549 --> 36:53.708
You complained of sleeplessness.

36:53.927 --> 36:55.635
I haven't slept much this month.

36:55.846 --> 36:59.844
- Are you taking anything?
- Lately I've been taking Halcion.

37:00.059 --> 37:02.051
Which could explain... Okay.

37:02.770 --> 37:04.016
The fact is, Jeanie-

37:04.231 --> 37:06.354
I mean, you've had such a rough time.

37:06.566 --> 37:09.853
With Al moving away and Scotty...

37:10.071 --> 37:12.312
That alone
could explain your symptoms.

37:12.741 --> 37:14.283
Yeah, you're right.

37:15.327 --> 37:17.154
If you ever wanna talk...

37:18.163 --> 37:20.203
Thanks, Kerry. I'd like that.

37:20.542 --> 37:21.740
Good.

37:22.836 --> 37:24.994
Figures are 10 percent
above projections.

37:25.171 --> 37:27.581
I think there'll be real cassette sales.

37:27.800 --> 37:29.460
Well, what about next time?

37:29.677 --> 37:31.919
Do I die on the TV?

37:32.138 --> 37:33.633
Don't make stupid jokes.

37:33.849 --> 37:37.468
Your blood sugar's still elevated.
I need to give you more insulin.

37:37.687 --> 37:40.723
I'm gonna make some phone calls,
sweetie.

37:42.817 --> 37:45.938
How often do you test
your blood sugar at home?

37:47.365 --> 37:49.690
What's that you're supposed to do?

37:50.285 --> 37:52.112
Four times a day? I don't know.

37:52.328 --> 37:54.535
To prevent complications, yes.

37:55.123 --> 37:57.033
Well, what kind of complications?

37:57.210 --> 38:00.544
Blindness, heart attack,
loss of peripheral circulation.

38:00.755 --> 38:02.713
Those are all good prayer vigils.

38:02.925 --> 38:04.123
I'm not joking.

38:04.343 --> 38:07.712
Take responsibility for your health.
Take your problems seriously.

38:08.389 --> 38:10.763
Honey, my problems are all I got.

38:11.518 --> 38:13.262
You wouldn't
make a living without them.

38:14.022 --> 38:16.727
Well, I sure as heck
wouldn't have Emmet.

38:19.027 --> 38:20.272
You're a lovely thing.

38:20.820 --> 38:22.980
- Are you married?
- No.

38:25.367 --> 38:28.571
Emmet and I were married
when we were in high school.

38:29.748 --> 38:32.500
Oh, we were crazy in love.

38:34.670 --> 38:36.794
You'd never know it now, would you?

38:37.757 --> 38:40.510
It's not for me
to make a judgment about that.

38:42.430 --> 38:44.256
I'll tell you one thing.

38:44.765 --> 38:46.094
Emmet won't leave me.

38:46.601 --> 38:47.881
Ever.

38:48.186 --> 38:49.764
God has...

38:49.938 --> 38:52.774
...given me the way to keep him close.

38:56.530 --> 38:58.403
He may not love me.

38:59.992 --> 39:03.492
But he loves the way caring for me
makes him look.

39:05.165 --> 39:07.490
I wouldn't be in a marriage
without love.

39:08.293 --> 39:10.999
Oh, honey, everyone thinks that.

39:11.839 --> 39:13.298
But things change.

39:14.467 --> 39:16.128
And you make do.

39:19.640 --> 39:21.051
So be careful.

39:22.101 --> 39:23.512
Thank you.

39:27.607 --> 39:30.064
So I suppose the Coq d'Or's
a bit dressy?

39:30.277 --> 39:33.481
Yeah. But actually,
I didn't make reservations there.

39:33.655 --> 39:36.149
- Our date's off?
- No, no.

39:36.452 --> 39:38.491
We're going to the Velvet Lounge.

39:39.664 --> 39:41.537
That's fantastic.

39:41.749 --> 39:45.700
- They'll look at us like we're crazy.
- You know that doesn't bother me.

39:45.921 --> 39:47.415
Wish I could say the same.

39:49.300 --> 39:53.084
Look, I can't change what I am
any more than you can.

39:53.304 --> 39:56.721
Whatever feelings I have for you
are based on who you are...

39:56.933 --> 39:58.843
...not what I want you to be.

39:59.020 --> 40:00.846
Elizabeth, you're not from here.

40:01.231 --> 40:03.388
I mean, you didn't grow up
the way I did.

40:04.401 --> 40:08.150
I wish I could say my feelings about
your skin color would disappear.

40:08.364 --> 40:11.115
But it doesn't work like that.
Do you understand?

40:11.325 --> 40:15.953
Yes. But I don't want to subject you
to something you're not ready for.

40:18.459 --> 40:21.626
You know, I've never met anybody
that makes me laugh...

40:21.838 --> 40:23.915
...or blush, or whatever,
the way you do.

40:24.800 --> 40:28.715
I'm trying to work through this.
You gotta trust me, all right?

40:31.016 --> 40:33.803
Come on,
let's go to the Velvet Lounge.

40:35.897 --> 40:36.928
Hey.

40:37.482 --> 40:39.309
Philly cheese steaks.

40:39.984 --> 40:43.567
I found them here. And they deliver.
Can you believe that?

40:43.906 --> 40:45.816
Want one? More than enough.

40:45.991 --> 40:47.190
No, thanks.

40:47.409 --> 40:51.112
Oh, come on! You get a free
angioplasty with a small order.

40:51.331 --> 40:54.001
Free quadruple bypass
with the dinner special?

40:54.710 --> 40:56.038
No?

40:57.589 --> 41:01.422
I was wondering. Maybe you'd like to
join Anna and I for dinner sometime.

41:01.635 --> 41:03.427
You really want an ally.

41:03.637 --> 41:06.092
No. It's about your friendship with her.

41:06.849 --> 41:09.720
I don't want her to cut herself off
from people she likes.

41:09.894 --> 41:11.687
Make it easier to go back to you.

41:13.065 --> 41:14.264
Am I hearing jealousy?

41:14.817 --> 41:16.015
Maybe once.

41:16.235 --> 41:17.646
Not now.

41:18.446 --> 41:20.107
I just think you're trouble.

41:20.407 --> 41:21.439
Maybe I'm wrong.

41:21.867 --> 41:23.491
I sort of hope I am.

41:23.702 --> 41:25.411
But that's what I think.

41:26.121 --> 41:29.871
I might laugh at your jokes, never
giving an indication of how I feel.

41:31.045 --> 41:32.752
But I wanted you to know that.

41:34.341 --> 41:35.882
Enjoy your dinner.

41:37.427 --> 41:39.420
Hey, Mark. I've been thinking.

41:39.637 --> 41:41.631
This storage area off the hallway...

41:41.849 --> 41:44.092
...could be made
a pediatric exam room.

41:44.310 --> 41:47.228
- The janitor's closet?
- Children's beds are small.

41:47.439 --> 41:50.441
We could hang the IV bags
on the hooks used for brooms.

41:50.609 --> 41:51.938
This is a joke.

41:52.111 --> 41:53.772
Maybe I'm facing reality.

41:53.988 --> 41:57.358
You're obviously behind the idea.
You gave Rosher a grand tour.

41:57.576 --> 42:00.613
He was very impressed
at how we handle our Pedes cases.

42:00.788 --> 42:02.282
Doug's your friend.

42:02.498 --> 42:05.582
You think Rosher's report
will get him an Attending position.

42:05.793 --> 42:09.543
I appreciate loyalty, but not
at the expense of the ER.

42:09.757 --> 42:11.750
That has nothing to do with it.

42:11.968 --> 42:16.262
I don't believe a Pedes unit
or Attending is a big improvement.

42:16.472 --> 42:19.308
Dr. Greene, Jeanie wants you to sign
off on a suture job.

42:19.518 --> 42:21.346
Will you go on record with that?

42:21.563 --> 42:23.520
Absolutely. When the time's right.

42:23.690 --> 42:24.722
Where is she?

42:35.537 --> 42:37.744
- Pulse ox 89.
- What's going on?

42:39.417 --> 42:41.209
Decreased breath on the left.

42:42.879 --> 42:45.631
A collapsed lung?
Should I get a portable x-ray?

42:45.841 --> 42:48.510
Can't be. Pressure's not that high.

42:48.718 --> 42:50.630
I'll give him 100 percent oxygen.

42:50.847 --> 42:53.635
- Could be a mucus plug.
- I'll get a suction catheter.

42:55.644 --> 42:56.675
Looks good.

42:56.896 --> 42:58.603
- Infected abrasion?
- Here.

42:58.814 --> 42:59.846
She cleaned it good.

43:00.066 --> 43:01.893
I'll change it when you come back.

43:02.110 --> 43:04.685
Sure. On Thursday.

43:10.495 --> 43:14.030
- It's secretions. Hook up the vent.
- Pulse ox 98.

43:14.250 --> 43:15.744
What the hell is this?

43:16.419 --> 43:17.830
This boy is my patient-

43:18.046 --> 43:19.540
Ketamine? What're you doing?

43:19.715 --> 43:22.549
An ultrarapid detox.
Everything's under control.

43:22.760 --> 43:25.796
Like hell it is. Is this baby
even a registered patient?

43:26.013 --> 43:27.472
- He-
- Is he on the board?

43:27.682 --> 43:30.008
If you'll just let me explain-

43:30.226 --> 43:32.552
You don't have consent, do you?

43:32.729 --> 43:35.896
You've got an intubated kid
under deep sedation?

43:36.108 --> 43:38.480
- It's under control.
- We gotta move this kid.

43:38.694 --> 43:40.106
- Hear me out-
- No.

43:40.322 --> 43:42.528
- BP 190/100.
- Nipride, 0.3 mcgs per kilo...

43:42.741 --> 43:44.568
- ... per minute-
- Gina, bag him.

43:44.785 --> 43:47.242
- Let's get to the PICU.
- We can do it right here.

43:47.414 --> 43:49.205
- His chart?
- I don't have one.

43:49.416 --> 43:51.705
Is this how you practice medicine?

43:51.919 --> 43:55.703
- I wrote everything on that paper.
- Oh, that's great.

43:55.923 --> 43:59.091
Inga, call the PICU.
Critical patient coming up.

43:59.260 --> 44:00.589
- I need a name.
- Name?

44:00.763 --> 44:02.756
- We don't have to.
- What's the name?

44:02.974 --> 44:04.681
- Josh McNeal.
- Baby McNeal.

44:04.892 --> 44:07.679
About six months old. Ketamine drip.
Intubated.

44:07.896 --> 44:09.272
What's going on?

44:09.440 --> 44:11.895
I found Doug in Exam 4,
detoxing this baby.

44:12.109 --> 44:14.186
- What?!
- I found him by accident.

44:14.403 --> 44:16.147
- Did you know?
- I was helping him.

44:16.364 --> 44:17.396
Helping him?!

44:17.615 --> 44:20.820
- He was stable, Kerry.
- This is a violation of every policy.

44:21.036 --> 44:24.038
- Bed's ready.
- Tell them I'm bringing him up!

44:24.248 --> 44:26.372
- I'm going too.
- You're damn right!

44:26.585 --> 44:28.827
You're gonna explain
to the Administration...

44:29.046 --> 44:30.624
...and the Executive Committee!

44:30.797 --> 44:32.173
Let's go!

44:32.383 --> 44:35.620
You lied to me.
You looked me in the face and lied.
