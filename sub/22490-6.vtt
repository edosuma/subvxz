00:19.119 --> 00:21.019
It's alive!

00:35.702 --> 00:36.828
Aah!

00:40.940 --> 00:42.134
Eee!

00:43.510 --> 00:46.001
Ha ha ha ha! Eee!

00:47.680 --> 00:51.480
Ha ha ha ha!
I have millions of these! Ha ha ha!

00:53.520 --> 00:56.546
Oh, my God! Look at the time!

00:56.589 --> 00:58.454
The bags! Just grab the bags.

00:58.491 --> 01:02.120
Oh! My hat. Where is my hat?

01:02.162 --> 01:03.823
Oh, wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait.
I need to make this happen.

01:03.863 --> 01:06.457
There's no time.
Are you kidding me? No time!

01:07.734 --> 01:11.465
Oh, no. Wait! No, please! Wait!

01:13.073 --> 01:15.473
Well, that's just great, Steve.

01:15.508 --> 01:18.534
My mother was so right
about you being unreliable.

01:18.578 --> 01:20.307
And now... now look at where we are!

01:20.346 --> 01:23.110
Well, I, um, uh...

01:24.150 --> 01:26.846
Are we too... we are!

01:26.886 --> 01:30.617
Come on. It's not that big a boat.
Just flip it o... aww!

01:33.693 --> 01:35.957
We're doomed. We're doomed.

01:35.995 --> 01:38.623
Aw, game over, man. Game over.

01:38.665 --> 01:41.225
You know what?
I'm gonna build my own ark.

01:41.267 --> 01:43.792
Yeah,
and it's gonna be better than Noah's.

01:47.107 --> 01:48.472
All right, yeah, do it.

01:52.145 --> 01:53.442
This sucks.

01:53.480 --> 01:59.578
Ha ha ha ha! You guys are gonna drown,
but we're a mermaid and a merman.

01:59.619 --> 02:02.053
We can swim! Ha ha ha!

02:03.289 --> 02:07.350
I hope you can also asexually reproduce.

02:07.393 --> 02:08.621
Crap.

02:13.800 --> 02:15.995
So, you told them
the wrong time on purpose?

02:16.035 --> 02:18.128
Yep. God hates freaks.

02:18.171 --> 02:19.934
That doesn't sound like God.

02:19.973 --> 02:22.840
That doesn't blah blah blah!

02:22.876 --> 02:26.710
Well, then, why did you
let the pixie fairies on board?

02:26.746 --> 02:27.974
I did?

02:31.818 --> 02:32.842
Aah!

02:32.886 --> 02:34.786
Get back here, you little dust tosser!

02:41.394 --> 02:42.725
Hmm!

02:44.364 --> 02:45.854
Ha ha!

02:55.141 --> 02:58.042
Ha ha ha ha! Goh!

02:59.712 --> 03:01.577
Oh!

03:03.483 --> 03:05.713
Kitty, my iPod's busted.

03:05.752 --> 03:08.949
I'm gonna put my foot
right up Steve Jobs' ass.

03:08.988 --> 03:11.320
Oh, hush, Red. I'm blogging.

03:11.357 --> 03:15.293
In Korea, you could get a good blogging
for five American dollars.

03:15.328 --> 03:18.422
Oh, honey. Ha ha ha ha ha!

03:19.599 --> 03:21.829
- Kelso.
- Fez.

03:21.868 --> 03:24.462
I just took your picture with my phone.

03:24.504 --> 03:25.732
I just sent it to you.

03:25.772 --> 03:27.797
Ooh, what a sexy photo.

03:27.840 --> 03:30.434
It really captures my metrosexuality.

03:30.476 --> 03:33.172
OK. Who just text-messaged me
that I'm a douchebag?

03:33.213 --> 03:34.202
Bargh!

03:35.281 --> 03:37.909
Hi. I'm TV's Topher Grace.

03:37.951 --> 03:40.283
As you've seen tonight,
the precious trappings...

03:40.320 --> 03:42.083
of our material-obsessed existence...

03:42.121 --> 03:44.351
become the sitcom fodder of the future.

03:44.390 --> 03:46.358
So, hey, please remember...

03:46.392 --> 03:48.360
try not to be such a douchebag.

03:48.394 --> 03:49.383
Thanks for listening.

03:52.031 --> 03:54.226
Bring out your dead!

03:57.403 --> 04:00.031
I'm not about to die
for a cause I don't believe in.

04:00.073 --> 04:03.668
I don't... what can I tell you?
I mean, this is... it's bad!

04:10.049 --> 04:13.109
Ohh. I sure am hungry.

04:13.152 --> 04:15.347
These carrots are not mine...

04:15.388 --> 04:18.118
but I'm hungry, so it's OK.

04:18.156 --> 04:21.786
Yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum.

04:21.827 --> 04:23.295
Who's eating my carrots?

04:23.329 --> 04:24.990
Oh, dear!

04:25.031 --> 04:28.797
Those carrots
are for robot Thanksgiving.

04:28.835 --> 04:29.767
Aah!

04:29.802 --> 04:32.134
I sure am glad I got you for Christmas...

04:32.171 --> 04:34.833
even though I wasn't good
every single day...

04:34.874 --> 04:38.002
and got a spanking
sometimes when I was bad.

04:39.078 --> 04:40.170
Aah!

04:40.213 --> 04:42.841
That's coming from the carrot patch!

04:45.451 --> 04:49.285
Oh, ho ho! Carrot stew...
and princess, too.

04:49.322 --> 04:51.290
I want to be the robot!

04:51.324 --> 04:52.916
I'm the robot!

04:52.959 --> 04:54.256
You're dumb.

04:54.294 --> 04:56.819
I will save you, Princess Britney.

04:56.863 --> 04:59.593
I will fight you. Pow! Pow! Pow!

04:59.632 --> 05:00.929
You're dead. You're dead.

05:00.967 --> 05:02.662
Nuh-uh. You're dead.

05:08.941 --> 05:12.399
My daddy says "I love you" with his belt.

05:12.445 --> 05:16.279
Mrs. McNally!
Mrs. McNally, Darryl made a fart.

05:16.316 --> 05:18.113
Pow! Pow!

05:18.151 --> 05:19.277
Quit it!

05:19.319 --> 05:22.413
I now pronounce you
husband, ro... wife, and robot.

05:28.027 --> 05:29.324
The end.

05:47.213 --> 05:50.182
I hear you're the guys to see
about entering a race.

05:50.216 --> 05:51.911
Not just any race.

05:52.985 --> 05:56.443
No race has higher stakes than this.

05:56.489 --> 05:58.616
I want in.

05:58.658 --> 06:00.990
You got to pay if you want to play.

06:03.696 --> 06:06.358
I haven't met the man yet...

06:06.399 --> 06:07.730
that I think can handle this race.

06:07.767 --> 06:09.894
I don't scare easy.

06:09.936 --> 06:12.905
- Ha ha ha!
- Ha ha ha!

06:34.794 --> 06:37.160
Let's stow away in the Mach 5,
for it goes so very fast...

06:37.196 --> 06:38.527
and we always greatly assist Speed...

06:38.564 --> 06:40.964
whenever he runs into trouble,
which he always does, mm-hmm?

06:41.000 --> 06:41.989
Chim chim.

07:15.935 --> 07:17.835
Better use the turbo boost.

07:17.870 --> 07:20.862
Michael, wait. I can only use
my turbo boost once per episode.

07:20.907 --> 07:22.238
Well, I'm using it.

07:26.946 --> 07:28.208
It's important that I do not move...

07:28.247 --> 07:29.771
because if I were to move,
that would add to the cost...

07:29.816 --> 07:31.909
so if I stay perfectly still,
it will be preferable to moving...

07:31.951 --> 07:34.010
because animation costs money, uh-huh.

07:45.731 --> 07:48.825
Gosh, golly, gee willikers,
ziminy jippity-do, Batman!

07:48.868 --> 07:50.699
Those policemen are pretty rude.

07:50.736 --> 07:54.194
Robin, law enforcement officers
are the backbone of our society.

07:55.641 --> 07:58.337
Mother...

07:59.445 --> 08:02.312
Yaaa-hoo!

08:08.254 --> 08:11.280
Now that guy is gaining.
We're never gonna win the race.

08:11.324 --> 08:13.485
I have to go to the bathroom.
Will you buy me a soda?

08:13.526 --> 08:15.084
My friend Jimmy's dad
bought him a new skateboard.

08:15.127 --> 08:17.459
I want a new skateboard.
This race is stupid.

08:25.972 --> 08:29.066
Hoo hoo hoo!
This'll fool them Duke boys.

08:34.714 --> 08:35.908
There's a detour, Bo.

08:38.918 --> 08:40.544
Yaaa...

08:41.621 --> 08:42.918
Oh.

08:42.955 --> 08:44.217
Oh, my God.

08:44.256 --> 08:47.784
I don't believe in cheating, Batman.
I believe in doing what's right.

08:47.827 --> 08:49.692
If you don't want a bat bitch-slap...

08:49.729 --> 08:53.529
you'll launch the Batnet
and take down those cops.

08:53.566 --> 08:54.555
Oops!

08:55.735 --> 08:58.932
- Aah!
- Retract the line. Retract the line!

08:58.971 --> 09:01.064
No, no, don't retract! Don't retract!

09:01.107 --> 09:03.598
- Aah!
- Aah! Get him off me!

09:05.611 --> 09:08.671
Oh, Lord! Aah!

09:20.626 --> 09:22.821
We're almost to the finish line, partner.

09:24.463 --> 09:25.452
Oh.

09:31.904 --> 09:33.132
Ha ha ha!

09:33.172 --> 09:34.867
Mario, we're losing.

09:34.907 --> 09:37.467
It's time to use the
blue tortoise shell, no?

09:37.510 --> 09:40.343
Do it,
you magnificent stereotypical bastard.

09:42.682 --> 09:46.778
The blue tortoise shell
is Mario kart race's ultimate weapon.

09:46.819 --> 09:50.755
It magically finds the lead car in the race,
and it takes it out.

09:50.790 --> 09:52.018
Ha ha ha!

09:55.494 --> 09:56.961
Urk!

10:09.875 --> 10:12.776
You're more man than me,
headless Ponch.

10:14.947 --> 10:17.347
Ooh!

10:17.383 --> 10:19.408
Headless Ponch.

10:19.452 --> 10:20.783
Headless Ponch!

10:20.820 --> 10:22.151
As the winner...

10:22.188 --> 10:27.091
you receive this gift basket
from Omaha steaks.

10:27.126 --> 10:28.525
Awesome. Wonderful.

10:28.561 --> 10:32.930
And a $50 gift certificate from Best Buy.

10:32.965 --> 10:35.559
Best Buy! Woof!

10:35.601 --> 10:37.933
Aww.

10:44.276 --> 10:48.007
I'm in awe of headless Ponch.
He's very attractive.

10:48.047 --> 10:50.345
- Headless pouch.
- Headless pouch.

10:50.383 --> 10:52.248
Ponch. Ponch. Ponch. Go.

10:52.284 --> 10:54.377
- Headless stick.
- Ha ha ha!

10:54.420 --> 10:57.082
Excuse me.
I just farted in a very musical tone.

10:58.791 --> 11:00.349
- Shut up!
- Ruff!

11:00.393 --> 11:02.452
I like being an American.

11:02.495 --> 11:07.330
I like everything about being Burt.

11:07.366 --> 11:10.164
Being Burt, being Burt, being Burt.

11:10.202 --> 11:11.499
Gosh, it's good.

11:13.673 --> 11:16.437
I want to show you something
that I'm very proud of...

11:16.475 --> 11:18.807
and it's gonna scare
the living... out of you.

11:18.844 --> 11:20.141
Ha ha ha!

11:20.179 --> 11:22.704
You will have to step back just a few feet.

11:22.748 --> 11:24.511
Print.

11:24.550 --> 11:26.211
Lunch.

11:29.055 --> 11:31.421
Stupid monkey.
