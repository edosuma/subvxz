20:15.963 --> 20:19.872
There was a war here a few years back.

20:21.408 --> 20:24.876
And I've been using the
dead and buried soldiers

20:24.912 --> 20:26.011
to experiment on.

20:27.713 --> 20:28.846
With a bit of success.

20:29.767 --> 20:32.651
You've got a freaky side, Neo,

20:33.160 --> 20:34.653
but I like it.

20:34.688 --> 20:36.655
There's a few hundred of them back there,

20:36.690 --> 20:39.591
which makes them an
army... Half-dead army.

20:39.626 --> 20:40.859
Or half-alive.

20:40.894 --> 20:43.195
Depends on whether you're a
glass-half-dead kind of guy.

20:43.230 --> 20:45.530
Either way, they're yours if you want them.

20:46.433 --> 20:48.734
Please take them. They freak me out.

20:48.769 --> 20:50.102
I like it.

20:50.137 --> 20:51.636
[Soldiers growling] Back, back!

20:53.089 --> 20:56.041
Have to be careful. They're... a bit bitey.

20:56.076 --> 20:57.676
[Growling continues]
