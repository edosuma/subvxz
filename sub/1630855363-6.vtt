Come on, guys, stop!

00:19.448 --> 00:20.651

-MIKEY: Hey.
-Hi.

00:23.491 --> 00:24.693
MIKEY:
You okay, buddy?

00:24.726 --> 00:26.062
-Yeah.
-MIKEY: Yeah?

00:26.429 --> 00:27.532
-SUGAR: Hmm.
-Yeah.

00:32.609 --> 00:33.744
(sighs)

00:35.314 --> 00:37.652
-I love you, bear.
-I love you, too, bear.

00:40.892 --> 00:43.297
Maybe just, like,

00:43.330 --> 00:45.133
like, don't do it to yourself?

00:47.171 --> 00:49.509
(sighs)
It's not like I'm trying to.

00:50.611 --> 00:53.450
But, you know,
when you do that,
it just kinda, like...

00:53.483 --> 00:55.187
does it to all of us?

00:55.220 --> 00:56.857
-Michael.
-Natalie.

00:58.360 --> 01:00.698
Just don't ask her.

01:01.900 --> 01:03.370
It's not like I wanna ask her.

01:03.403 --> 01:05.608
I know, I know,
but it's that thing, you know.

01:06.910 --> 01:08.514
You ask somebody
if they're okay,

01:08.547 --> 01:10.818
they immediately start thinking
they're not acting okay...

01:11.553 --> 01:14.659
and that immediately makes them
start not acting okay.

01:16.930 --> 01:19.302
No one can make anyone else
act a certain way.

01:19.335 --> 01:20.504

01:21.907 --> 01:23.745
Okay.

01:23.778 --> 01:25.582
-Remember last year?
-MIKEY: Hmm.

01:25.615 --> 01:27.552
-And the year before?
-Yeah.

01:27.585 --> 01:28.654
So I'm not fucking crazy.

01:28.687 --> 01:30.725
Nobody thinks you're crazy.
Nobody's saying that.

01:30.758 --> 01:31.593
Well, she is.

01:31.627 --> 01:33.429
Yeah, she's fuckin'
out of her mind.

01:34.800 --> 01:37.471
And here I am,
just fucking in the middle

01:37.505 --> 01:40.310
because you're you
and Carmy's Carmy.

01:40.343 --> 01:43.818
MIKEY:
Okay, so then, just,
you know, let us handle it.

01:43.851 --> 01:45.755
-You won't handle it.
-MIKEY: No, we won't. Exactly.

01:45.788 --> 01:46.857
That's my point.

01:46.890 --> 01:48.728
With her, not handling it,

01:48.761 --> 01:50.498
it's the best way to handle it.

01:51.366 --> 01:52.869
I mean, where do you think
she's at right now?

01:52.902 --> 01:55.374
What, like at a four?
A five?

01:55.407 --> 01:56.744
She's not at a six, right?

01:56.777 --> 01:58.346
Hmm. No.

01:58.881 --> 02:01.520
I've heard you ask her
three times tonight
if she's alright.

02:01.553 --> 02:03.791
You don't have to ask her
every ten minutes if she's okay.

02:03.824 --> 02:04.893
That's not gonna help anything.

02:04.926 --> 02:06.229
Do you know how much
I would love

02:06.262 --> 02:07.398
to feel like I didn't
have to ask her?

02:07.431 --> 02:08.735
I bet you would
love that very, very much.

02:08.768 --> 02:09.937
-Yes, a lot.
-Yeah. Yeah.

02:09.970 --> 02:11.339

-I'm sure.

Hey, hey, Mikey, can you come
inside and be you real quick?

02:17.819 --> 02:18.955
I don't know how to deal
with these people.

02:18.988 --> 02:20.290
Yeah, I'll be right there.

I'm happy you're home.

02:59.903 --> 03:00.805

03:05.915 --> 03:07.919
I'm not gonna ask
if she's okay.

03:08.353 --> 03:09.723

-Yeah.

03:09.756 --> 03:11.827

03:12.962 --> 03:14.332

07:43.904 --> 07:45.040
I'm the guy that does food.

07:45.073 --> 07:46.109
You're the guy that what?
You-you, uh...

07:46.142 --> 07:47.746
You start
100 different businesses

07:47.779 --> 07:48.981
and have zero follow-through.

07:49.015 --> 07:50.551
-DONNA: Carmen, I need you
to check the branzino.
-Wow.

07:50.584 --> 07:52.020
I feel like
that was a shot, Carm.

07:52.053 --> 07:53.691
Okay, this is why, this is why
I didn't wanna come home.

07:53.724 --> 07:55.293
-This is why.
-Fuck you.

07:55.326 --> 07:57.665
-What the fuck? What?
-Why the fuck
would you say that?

07:57.698 --> 07:59.168
It's fuckin' Christmas.
Why would you say
you didn't wanna come back?

07:59.201 --> 08:00.270
Whatever, okay? Whatever.

08:00.303 --> 08:01.607
-MIKEY: Whatever. Okay.
-(ringing)

08:01.640 --> 08:03.109
We're very happy
you're home, Carm.

08:03.142 --> 08:04.846
-DONNA: Yes, we are.
-We're all very
fucking proud of you.

08:04.879 --> 08:06.784
-We all really fuckin' love you.
-I'm not a fuckin' baby.

08:06.817 --> 08:08.721
Then stop being
a fuckin' pussy
and say the words.

08:08.754 --> 08:10.658
-Stop being a pussy.
Just say the fuckin' words.
-DONNA: Say the words.

08:10.691 --> 08:12.061
-Carmen, come on.
-Just say the words.

08:12.094 --> 08:13.195
DONNA: Just say it.

08:15.166 --> 08:16.770
-I love you.
-DONNA: (grunts) Ohh!

08:16.803 --> 08:18.941
-MIKEY: Thank you. Thank you.
-DONNA: Thank you.

08:18.974 --> 08:20.945
-Thank you.
-DONNA: Okay.

08:20.978 --> 08:22.715
So happy the bear's home.

08:22.748 --> 08:24.953
DONNA: Yes, I'm happy.
Come here. I am happy.

08:24.986 --> 08:26.021
-Hi. Yeah. Okay.
-DONNA: Happy, happy.

08:26.055 --> 08:28.059
-CARMY: Thank you.
-You know, it's nice he's back.

08:28.092 --> 08:29.027
We get him only once a year.

08:29.061 --> 08:31.733
-CARMY: Mom.
-DONNA: He's too fancy for us.

08:32.201 --> 08:33.804
Okay, Carmen,
I need you to pay attention.

08:34.205 --> 08:35.875
-CARMY: Yeah, yeah.
-Alright? No, come here.

08:35.908 --> 08:37.645
-CARMY: What?
-So when that timer goes off...

08:37.678 --> 08:39.215
-Uh-huh.
-...I need you to remember

08:39.248 --> 08:40.785
to put the Rockefellers in,

08:40.818 --> 08:43.323
um, and-and take out
the artichokes,

08:43.356 --> 08:44.659
which leaves an open oven.

08:44.692 --> 08:46.162
Stop doing something
and just listen.

08:46.195 --> 08:47.565
CARMY: Okay. Alright,
I hear you, I hear you.

08:47.598 --> 08:48.868
-What was I saying?
-CARMY: What? What?

08:48.901 --> 08:50.805
We were saying we gotta
free up one of the slots

08:50.838 --> 08:52.074
-in the oven, right? Yes. Okay.
-DONNA: Right, oven slot.

08:52.107 --> 08:53.744
So then, we take
the artichokes out.

08:53.777 --> 08:56.315
So then I need you to put
the branzino on the top

08:56.348 --> 08:57.685
and let it broil
and just get that

08:57.718 --> 08:59.188
nice little crispy bit on top.

08:59.221 --> 09:01.092
-Uh-huh.
-And then I need to remember
to set this timer back

09:01.125 --> 09:03.631
to two minutes
to drop the lobsters back in.

09:03.664 --> 09:05.200
And then when that goes off,

09:05.233 --> 09:06.837
I need you
to take the branzino out.

09:06.870 --> 09:08.941
And-and don't forget
to stir the gravy.

09:08.974 --> 09:11.212
-Oh, my God.
-Why? What do we got gravy for?

09:11.245 --> 09:13.082
Because nobody gets this shit.

09:13.115 --> 09:15.755
That was unpleasant.
I threw up all over my sweater.

09:15.788 --> 09:16.890
Is it okay
I borrowed your robe?

09:16.924 --> 09:18.694
-DONNA: Oh, of course.
You know what?
-I'm sorry.

09:18.727 --> 09:20.030
DONNA:
It looks so pretty on you.
You should keep it.

09:20.063 --> 09:21.767
-Oh, you're so sweet.
-No, no, no. Seriously.

09:21.800 --> 09:23.002
-Hi, Carm. hi, hi.
-CARMY: Hi, Tiff.

09:23.035 --> 09:24.171
-Hi. How are you?
-How you doing? You okay?

09:24.204 --> 09:25.239
I mean,
I'm puking everywhere.

09:25.273 --> 09:26.776
But I'm alright. I'm pregnant.
Do you know this?

09:26.810 --> 09:28.981
-CARMY: Yeah, yeah.
Congratulations. I know.
-We're having a baby. Thank you.

09:29.014 --> 09:30.350
-She is not alright.
-Why?

09:30.383 --> 09:31.820
-TIFF: What? I mean...
-She is throwing up.

09:31.853 --> 09:34.158
Get her some Brioschi.
I mean... You know what?

09:34.191 --> 09:35.862
Hey, Ri, Ri.

09:35.895 --> 09:37.632
-Get your fucking ass in here.
-RICHIE: What?

09:37.665 --> 09:39.401
DONNA: Get Tiff
some Brioschi right now.

09:39.434 --> 09:41.038
-Oh, my God. What's going on?
-That's it, that's it, I got it.

09:41.071 --> 09:42.340
-TIFF: How was Ireland?
-Uh, Copenhagen.

09:42.373 --> 09:44.378
-TIFF: Oh, sorry.
Where is Copenhagen?
-Yeah. Sorry, sorry.

09:44.411 --> 09:45.781
-CARMY: Huh?
-TIFF: Where's Copenhagen?

09:45.814 --> 09:46.749
RICHIE:
Aunt Deedee,

09:46.783 --> 09:49.088
why are you
screaming at me
like a maniac?

09:49.121 --> 09:50.992
Why are you screaming at me
like a maniac?

09:51.025 --> 09:52.394
-DONNA: Stop tickling me!
-RICHIE: Wh... (laughs)

09:52.427 --> 09:53.831
DONNA: Stop it right now!

09:53.864 --> 09:55.400
RICHIE: Why are you
screaming like a maniac?

09:55.433 --> 09:57.171
-I'm right here.
-You know. You know
I'm really ticklish.

09:57.204 --> 09:58.139
-RICHIE: Alright, alright.
-Stop.

09:58.172 --> 09:59.141
CARMY:
Watch out. Watch out.

09:59.174 --> 10:01.345
-Richie. Jesus Christ.
-She's okay. She's fine.

10:01.378 --> 10:02.916
-TIFF: How do you know I'm okay?
-RICHIE: She's alright.

10:02.949 --> 10:04.351
-She's a little nauseous.
-Be a gentleman

10:04.384 --> 10:05.587
-and take care of her.
-She's a little bit nauseous.

10:05.621 --> 10:08.159
-Actually--
-What the hell do you
have on your sleeve?

10:08.192 --> 10:10.397
-Don't worry about it.
-Jesus, this is your
nice sweater. I got it for you.

10:10.430 --> 10:12.769
Actually, nausea's good for
a baby 'cause it lets you
know that they're healthy.

10:12.802 --> 10:14.438
-He read one book. Yeah.
-DONNA: Okay, you know what.

10:14.471 --> 10:16.743
-Do you wanna go lay down
upstairs in my bed?
-That would be nice.

10:16.776 --> 10:18.279
-Oh, thanks, D.
-Of course.

10:18.312 --> 10:20.217
-D, you got a little
green on you.
-That's sweet of you.

10:20.250 --> 10:22.187
Oh, okay. Thank you.
You know what? Go lay down.

10:22.220 --> 10:23.089
RICHIE: You want
a Sprite or something?

10:23.122 --> 10:24.659
You go up, I'm gonna
get you a Sprite.

10:24.692 --> 10:25.895
-Alright.
-You want anything else, babe?

10:25.928 --> 10:27.064
-I don't know.
-DONNA: You good, bear?

10:27.097 --> 10:28.132
CARMY: Yeah, yeah.
I'm good, I'm good.

10:28.165 --> 10:29.235
I asked you not to do this.

10:29.268 --> 10:30.705
-I didn't do anything.
-Yeah.

10:30.738 --> 10:31.673
-What?
-You look a little green.

10:31.707 --> 10:32.609
-Do you want a Sprite?
-Thank you, I feel--

10:32.642 --> 10:34.779
Oh, yeah, that would be nice.
Thank you.

10:34.812 --> 10:36.315
-SUGAR: Yeah.
-How do you feel?

10:36.348 --> 10:38.052
-SUGAR: Not great.
-I-I feel terrible.

10:38.486 --> 10:39.789
SUGAR: Okay, feel better.

10:40.323 --> 10:41.994
-Here, paper towels.
-Thank you, thanks, Sug.

10:42.027 --> 10:43.162
-RICHIE: Yo, Auntie D.
-DONNA: What?

10:43.731 --> 10:45.033
RICHIE:
Uh, are we outta Sprite?

10:45.066 --> 10:46.335
DONNA:
We don't have Sprite.

10:46.368 --> 10:48.106
-RICHIE: We don't have Sprite?
-CARMY: Ma! Ma!

10:48.139 --> 10:50.210
Cousin... I got it.
I got it. I got it.

10:50.243 --> 10:51.980
DONNA:
Well, no, no, no, no, no.
You can't go to the store.

10:52.013 --> 10:53.349
You're gonna go
to the store now?

10:53.382 --> 10:54.886
-My timers are going off.
-Mom, I know.

10:54.919 --> 10:55.988
-Carmen. I need you.
-CARMY: I know, I know.

10:56.021 --> 10:57.124
No, no, I'm gonna make it.

10:57.157 --> 10:58.159
I'm gonna make it.
It's fine.

10:58.192 --> 10:59.294
DONNA:
Oh, you're gonna make it.

10:59.328 --> 11:01.032
-CARMY: Yeah.
-RICHIE: You're gonna
make Sprite?

11:01.065 --> 11:02.434
CARMY: Yeah, I'm gonna
make fuckin' Sprite, yeah.

11:02.467 --> 11:04.471
Are you a fuckin' pop machine?

11:04.505 --> 11:05.908
Yeah, I'm a fuckin' pop machine.

11:05.941 --> 11:07.444
Hey, Ma,
are you sure you're good?

11:07.477 --> 11:10.350
Listen, I know you keep thinking
like you wanna try to help.

11:10.383 --> 11:12.220
Do you wanna just
make the whole dinner?

11:12.253 --> 11:13.256
-SUGAR: I want to help you.
-How do you know how
to make a Sprite?

11:13.289 --> 11:15.293
Just stop. Okay?
Just stop.

11:15.326 --> 11:16.763
RICHIE:
How the fuck do you know
how to make Sprite?

11:16.796 --> 11:17.899
You know how he knows
how to make Sprite?

11:17.932 --> 11:19.068
Because he's a big-time chef.

11:19.101 --> 11:20.003
-Oh. Got it, got it.
-That's how.

11:20.036 --> 11:22.107
-That's how I know.
-Somehow, I forgot.

11:22.140 --> 11:23.142
Nattie, I appreciate you.
Thank you for asking.

11:23.175 --> 11:24.010
-SUGAR: Okay.
-DONNA: Thank you.

11:24.044 --> 11:25.480
-RICHIE: Yo, Auntie D.
-DONNA: What?

11:25.514 --> 11:27.284
-Why the seven fishes?
-DONNA: Oh, my God.

11:27.317 --> 11:29.288
What is up with everyone today?

11:29.321 --> 11:30.758
I'm just trying to make
a nice fuckin' thing.

11:30.791 --> 11:32.160
I just mean why the fuck
do people even do it?

11:32.193 --> 11:36.002
Because it's based
on people who left Italy

11:36.035 --> 11:39.308
to find new dreams
and homes with new people.

11:39.341 --> 11:41.112
And they brought
their seven best things

11:41.145 --> 11:43.449
from their sea
to their new homes,

11:43.482 --> 11:45.120
and not so their families end up

11:45.153 --> 11:46.757
being a bunch
of fuckin' jagoffs.

11:46.790 --> 11:47.992
-That's not even close.
-What's not even close?

11:48.025 --> 11:49.194
Why do you come
in here talking shit?

11:49.227 --> 11:50.363
I'm not talking shit.
I'm just saying,

11:50.396 --> 11:52.467
her seven fishes legend
is not even close.

11:52.501 --> 11:54.337
There are sevens
all over the Bible.

11:54.739 --> 11:59.081
You get Sacraments, virtues,
days, guilt, probably.

11:59.114 --> 12:01.018
You know,
making people feel like shit,

12:01.051 --> 12:03.824
holding everything in
and then letting it out
inappropriately,

12:03.857 --> 12:06.262
raging, pouting,
screaming, making scenes.

12:06.295 --> 12:07.999
You know,
all the Italian classics.

12:08.032 --> 12:09.368
Yo, you're
not even Italian, bro.

12:09.401 --> 12:11.906
I know. Polski, baby.
Polski.

12:13.577 --> 12:15.246
-I like your version better.
-Thanks.

12:15.279 --> 12:16.550
Hey, Carmen, take out

12:16.583 --> 12:18.219
the proscuit
and the mortadel, please.

12:18.252 --> 12:19.321
Yeah, I got you.

12:19.354 --> 12:20.456
Yo, Carm.

12:20.724 --> 12:22.227
CARMY:
Yo? Here you go, Sprite.

12:22.260 --> 12:23.530
-RICHIE: Sprite? Sprite. Fuck.
-CARMY: Sprite.

12:23.563 --> 12:25.400
Why isn't somebody
listening to me?

12:25.433 --> 12:26.636
-CARMY: What? I'm listening.
-No, no, no.

12:26.670 --> 12:29.174
-Why is no one listening to me?
-CARMY: I'm listening. What?

12:29.207 --> 12:31.012
-What? What?
-I said move the pot.

12:31.045 --> 12:34.084
-When?
-DONNA: I said move the pot.

12:34.117 --> 12:35.988
Right now? I'll move the pot.
You want me to move the pot?

12:36.021 --> 12:37.892
-I said move the fucking pot.
-CARMY: Okay! Alright!

12:37.925 --> 12:39.260
Here, here. Here's the pot.

12:39.528 --> 12:42.401
And it's fuckin' moving.
And it's going right over here.

12:42.434 --> 12:44.071
-Thank you.
-Okay? There you go.

12:44.104 --> 12:45.407
-I'm sorry.
I just need a second.
-Thank you.

12:45.440 --> 12:46.843
CARMY: I just need
to go look at this...

12:47.477 --> 12:49.281
Thank you.

12:49.314 --> 12:51.185
-MIKEY: One sec,
I gotta find Rich. Cousin!
CARMY: Jesus fucking...

12:51.218 --> 12:52.522
-Cousin!
-RICHIE: Yo.

12:52.555 --> 12:53.824
-Did you tell him?
-What?

12:53.857 --> 12:54.993
Did you fuckin tell him?

12:55.026 --> 12:56.162
Wh-wh-wh-what? What?

12:56.195 --> 12:57.965
-Oh, fuck me! Dawg!
-Bro...

12:57.998 --> 12:59.435
Merry fuckin' Christmas, bro.

12:59.468 --> 13:00.571
-What? What do you mean?
-Merry fuckin' Christmas

13:00.604 --> 13:01.573
Guys, don't fuck
with me right now.

13:01.606 --> 13:02.942
No one's fuckin' with you.

13:02.975 --> 13:04.111
What the fuck?
Why would you think that?

13:04.144 --> 13:05.179
'Cause you're always
fuckin' with me,

13:05.213 --> 13:06.181
that's why I fuckin think it.
What do you mean?

13:06.215 --> 13:08.620
You're not gonna
fucking believe who we just saw.

13:08.653 --> 13:09.923
No, no, no, no, no, no.
This is a good thing.

13:09.956 --> 13:11.392
This is a good thing.
Just listen.

13:11.425 --> 13:12.327
-What do you mean?
-MIKEY: Don't be
a mopey little fuck.

13:12.360 --> 13:13.664
What? I'm not being
a mopey little fuck.

13:13.697 --> 13:16.168
Just take a break.
Take a break from being
a mopey little fuck.

13:16.201 --> 13:17.538
-We're trying to tell you...
-RICHIE: Shut your mouth.
Just listen.

13:17.571 --> 13:19.308
We're trying to tell you
we ran into

13:19.341 --> 13:20.377
the love of your fucking life.

13:20.410 --> 13:21.479
I don't have a love of my life.

13:21.513 --> 13:23.249
-RICHIE: Just fucking tell him.
-MIKEY: Claire bear.

13:23.282 --> 13:24.519
-RICHIE: Claire bear!
-MIKEY: Claire bear.

13:24.552 --> 13:26.422
-You saw Claire?
-We saw Claire bear!

13:26.455 --> 13:29.461
That fuckin' chubby little
genius down the street,
she's beautiful.

13:29.495 --> 13:31.332
-The body is banging!
-Banging, yo. Banging.

13:31.365 --> 13:32.969
RICHIE:
Yo, she is hot as balls.

13:33.002 --> 13:34.204
-MIKEY:
Hot as fuckin' balls, dude.
-Yo.

13:34.237 --> 13:35.473
RICHIE: Oh, my God,
the glasses came off.

13:35.507 --> 13:38.279
The motherfucking glasses
came off, G!

13:38.312 --> 13:39.949
RICHIE: Like a librarian
in a fuckin' porno.

13:39.982 --> 13:41.318
She's all that
and a fuckin' basket
of biscuits, bro.

13:41.351 --> 13:42.522
And by the way, she's like,

13:42.555 --> 13:44.291
she's like
a legitimate fucking wizard.

13:44.324 --> 13:45.995
-Yeah. Oh, yeah. That's true.
-MIKEY: She's like a wizard.

13:46.028 --> 13:47.063
Tiffany used to babysit her.

13:47.097 --> 13:48.199
-She's obsessed with science.
-What did you do?

13:48.232 --> 13:49.969
-She's obsessed with science.
-She's in med school.

13:50.002 --> 13:51.205
-She's in med school.
-What did you do?

13:51.238 --> 13:52.642
-What did you do?
-We didn't do anything.

13:52.675 --> 13:54.311
-CARMY: What do you mean?
-We just massaged the fuckin'...

13:54.344 --> 13:56.082
Bro, this is a
once-in-a-million opportunity

13:56.115 --> 13:57.217
for you to score with a woman

13:57.250 --> 13:58.887
that's stacked
physically and mentally.

13:58.920 --> 14:00.558
Homie, you're having a child.
Like, what the fuck?

14:00.591 --> 14:01.960
Why are you talking like that?

14:01.993 --> 14:03.096
It's not about me.

14:03.129 --> 14:04.398
Carmen, what are you
talking about?

14:04.431 --> 14:06.168
-It's done.
-Who asked you
to do that, though?

14:06.201 --> 14:07.605
Who asked you to do that?
That's what I'm saying.

14:07.638 --> 14:09.108
It's Christmas.
I fuckin' put in a good word.

14:09.141 --> 14:10.243
CARMY:
Nobody asked you to do that.

14:10.276 --> 14:12.080
I told her about Napa,
about Copen...

14:12.113 --> 14:13.316
I feel like
you're breaking my balls.
That's what you're doing.

14:13.349 --> 14:14.451
I don't understand
why you always do that.

14:14.484 --> 14:15.319
Like, why are you like this?

14:15.353 --> 14:17.324
But she's hot now, Carm.
She's hot now.

14:17.357 --> 14:19.094
-I'm just like...
-Stevie was with us.

14:19.127 --> 14:19.996
Hey, Steven,
get the fuck in here, please.

14:20.029 --> 14:21.398
I don't need Steven
to come over here.

14:21.431 --> 14:22.968
RICHIE: Hey, Steven,
get the fuck in here.

14:23.001 --> 14:25.173
-Would you please
tell him who we ran into?
-RICHIE: He doesn't believe us.

14:25.206 --> 14:26.375
Oh, we saw Claire bear.

14:26.408 --> 14:27.612
-Boom!
-RICHIE: You see?

14:27.645 --> 14:30.049
STEVEN: On the weekends,
this woman teaches CPR

14:30.082 --> 14:31.452
to differently abled
college kids.

14:31.485 --> 14:32.588
Yeah, like, is that, like, Fak?

14:32.621 --> 14:33.556
-Like Neil?
-MIKEY: You see?

14:33.590 --> 14:35.494
-She's a deeply good person.
-MIKEY: Boom!

14:35.527 --> 14:36.630
I can see why
you're in love with her.

14:36.663 --> 14:37.632
I'm not in love
with her, though.

14:37.665 --> 14:38.332
That's what I'm saying.

14:38.366 --> 14:39.502
Where did you guys get this from

14:39.535 --> 14:40.469
that I'm in love with her?

14:40.504 --> 14:42.107
RICHIE: You used to have
all those drawings.

14:42.140 --> 14:43.409
That's what I'm fuckin'
talking about, though.

14:43.442 --> 14:44.411
That's what
I'm fucking talking about.

14:44.444 --> 14:46.115
-STEVEN: May I say...
-That's what I'm saying.

14:46.148 --> 14:47.150
That's why I think
you're fucking with me.

14:47.183 --> 14:48.252
You're
bringing up this thing

14:48.285 --> 14:49.989
you used to give me
a fucking hard time about it.

14:50.022 --> 14:51.158
You used to give me
a fucking hard time about it.

14:51.191 --> 14:52.160
-Relax.
-No one's giving you...

14:52.193 --> 14:53.262
Don't touch me.

14:53.295 --> 14:55.033
STEVEN:
Your brother handled it.

14:55.066 --> 14:56.235
-(timer ringing)
-I want to touch you.

14:56.268 --> 14:58.005
-(overlapping chatter)
-Don't touch me.

14:58.038 --> 14:59.576
Mikey, don't fuckin' touch me.
I'm serious.

14:59.609 --> 15:01.546
-I want to touch you.
-(ringing continues)

15:01.579 --> 15:03.249
Don't fucking touch me.
Mikey. Stop.

15:03.282 --> 15:04.318
-DONNA: Hey!
-CARMY: Mikey!

15:04.351 --> 15:05.588
-What the fuck?
-RICHIE: Yo!

15:05.621 --> 15:07.457
Auntie D, did you just
throw a spoon at me?

15:07.490 --> 15:09.596
DONNA: Yeah, I did.
You, Richard, bring her the pop.

15:09.629 --> 15:11.165
-Deedee--
-DONNA: Carmen, I need you.

15:11.198 --> 15:13.035
-Can you just calm down?
-Ma, you gotta chill, Mom.

15:13.068 --> 15:14.404
Ma, you gotta chill.

15:14.437 --> 15:16.141
DONNA: No, no, no.
You cannot say that.

15:16.174 --> 15:17.377
We're not done with
this Claire Bear thing.

15:17.410 --> 15:19.147
You're fuckin'
breaking my balls.

15:19.180 --> 15:21.318
RICHIE:
No, I think, I think it's just
a big misunderstanding.

15:21.351 --> 15:23.557
Carm... this is a good thing.

15:23.590 --> 15:26.061
DONNA:
You, Carmen, come on.
I need help.

15:26.094 --> 15:28.032
RICHIE:
Yo, Deedee, can you just
calm down a little...

15:28.065 --> 15:29.602
DONNA:
Hey, no, you do not tell me...

15:36.215 --> 15:37.585
IFF: Hi. -RICHIE: Hi.

15:37.618 --> 15:38.553
TIFF: Hi.

15:41.693 --> 15:42.762
How you doing?

15:42.795 --> 15:43.963
I'm okay.

15:44.665 --> 15:45.634
I'm good.

15:47.671 --> 15:49.609
This room is so insane.

15:49.642 --> 15:52.247
Yeah, it's a lot. Yeah.

15:52.280 --> 15:54.250
Um, we're out of Sprite, but...

15:55.520 --> 15:58.159
Carmy made this for you.

15:58.192 --> 15:59.361
TIFF:
What do you mean
he made it for me?

15:59.394 --> 16:00.564
RICHIE:
He made it for you.

16:00.597 --> 16:02.066
He's like a goddamn
pop machine, this guy.

16:03.235 --> 16:04.505
He's a weird little dude.

16:05.339 --> 16:07.143
(Richie laughs)

16:09.047 --> 16:10.216
-Yo.
-Right?

16:11.051 --> 16:12.053
Right?

16:12.086 --> 16:13.089
What's up with him, though?

16:13.122 --> 16:14.558
He's so, like...

16:14.892 --> 16:17.397
I don't know.
He's a little... Yeah.

16:17.430 --> 16:20.035
He's... weird.

16:21.839 --> 16:23.108
We're, um...

16:24.779 --> 16:26.583
We're trying to hook him up
with Claire bear,

16:26.616 --> 16:28.352
you know,
loosen him up a little bit.

16:28.385 --> 16:29.488
-With Claire?
-RICHIE: Yeah.

16:29.522 --> 16:31.258
Why would you do that?
She's so nice.

16:33.697 --> 16:34.698
Are you still mad at me?

16:38.439 --> 16:39.440
No.

16:40.711 --> 16:42.080
I threw up so many times,

16:42.113 --> 16:43.717
I honestly forgot
what I was mad about.

16:43.750 --> 16:45.186
You just puked
all that anger up?

16:45.219 --> 16:46.488
Just got it all outta you?

16:50.229 --> 16:52.367
I'll take it.

16:52.400 --> 16:54.539
Hey, did you go
look at the place?

16:54.572 --> 16:56.374
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

16:57.377 --> 16:58.445
What'd you think?

17:02.521 --> 17:04.091
I think it's expensive.

17:04.124 --> 17:06.128
But it's nice.

17:06.161 --> 17:07.564
And schools are nice.

17:09.134 --> 17:10.302
It's public school.

17:12.808 --> 17:14.477
You can walk to school.

17:31.144 --> 17:32.413
-Hi.
-Hey.

17:37.290 --> 17:38.191
Hi.

17:41.566 --> 17:43.168
-I had a dream.
-Mm-hmm.

17:43.803 --> 17:45.740
That we only wore
green clothes.

17:46.441 --> 17:48.713
They were our clothes,
but they were all green.

17:49.281 --> 17:50.851
-RICHIE: Mm-hmm.
-And then the baby

17:50.884 --> 17:52.453
only wore red clothes.

17:53.155 --> 17:55.360
Like I went to the store and I
bought all these other colors

17:55.393 --> 17:57.898
and I brought 'em back home
and then they were all red.

17:57.931 --> 17:59.100
What do you think?

18:00.403 --> 18:02.240
I think that's
pretty fuckin' dope.

18:02.273 --> 18:03.408
That's what I thought.

18:14.932 --> 18:16.502
Do you think
that she'll like us?

18:22.948 --> 18:24.686
I don't know.

18:24.719 --> 18:25.820
I hope so.

18:27.490 --> 18:29.495
-Yeah, me, too.
-We just gotta...

18:30.864 --> 18:32.701
not be like our parents,
you know.

18:34.605 --> 18:36.141
Well, you're not like a...

18:37.945 --> 18:41.385
a psycho vampire...

18:41.418 --> 18:42.721
TIFF: Alcoholic.

18:43.088 --> 18:45.193
-...bitch, like...
No offense, but.
-Vindictive.

18:45.226 --> 18:47.129
No. It's-it's accurate.

18:49.835 --> 18:51.305
I'm actually here.

18:51.338 --> 18:52.674
That's a start.

18:55.814 --> 18:58.285
-Am I squishing you?
-No, no, it's good. It's good.

18:58.318 --> 18:59.287
I like it.

19:01.358 --> 19:02.527
You're so cute.

19:04.297 --> 19:06.201
You're gonna be
such a cute dad.

19:17.457 --> 19:19.260
I really don't wanna
throw up again.

19:22.333 --> 19:23.703
You don't smell like barf.

19:25.372 --> 19:26.241
That's good.

19:26.274 --> 19:28.746
I like chugged Listerine.

19:31.586 --> 19:32.754
(Richie sighs)

19:36.294 --> 19:38.767
The upside of barf is that
you get some peace and quiet.

19:38.800 --> 19:41.506
-That is true.
-(Richie sighs)

19:41.539 --> 19:44.477
I get to be away from
all those psychos downstairs.

19:45.680 --> 19:47.016
Do you think
Donna's gonna kill me

19:47.049 --> 19:48.753
if I throw up on her robe?

19:49.287 --> 19:51.324
-I don't think she'll notice.
-(Tiff chuckles)

20:15.974 --> 20:17.343
I love you so much.

20:17.376 --> 20:18.880
TIFF: I love you so much.

20:21.919 --> 20:23.957
I have one quick question,
though, for you.

20:23.990 --> 20:26.361
-RICHIE: Mm-hmm.
-Is that a leopard

20:26.729 --> 20:29.467
or is it a cheetah
or is it a panther?

20:30.436 --> 20:31.505
That's a leopard.

20:31.939 --> 20:33.510
We're in Donna's bedroom.

20:33.543 --> 20:34.946
-(growls)
-There's not gonna
be a fuckin' cheetah.

20:34.979 --> 20:36.314
(Richie laughs)

20:38.352 --> 20:39.755
Alright, I gotta go back down.

20:39.788 --> 20:40.790
Okay.

20:41.659 --> 20:43.896
RICHIE:
I'll come back and check on you
in a few minutes.

20:48.438 --> 20:50.710
-I love you so much.
-I love you.

20:54.117 --> 20:55.086
RICHIE: Merry Christmas.

20:55.119 --> 20:56.822
Merry fuckin' Christmas.

20:58.325 --> 20:59.495
(sighs)

21:04.638 --> 21:06.876
DONNA:
Fuck! God-- Fuck!

21:06.909 --> 21:09.582
-Hey, I got this. I got this.
-No, it's okay. It's okay.

21:09.615 --> 21:10.884
-LEE: Yeah.
-DONNA: No, wait.

21:11.385 --> 21:14.090
-LEE: Ugh, here. Let me help.
-DONNA: Fuck! Thanks.

21:14.123 --> 21:15.593
Hey, did you get
that thing I sent you?

21:16.061 --> 21:17.363
No. What'd you send me?

21:17.396 --> 21:18.800
It's a building in Wilmette.

21:18.833 --> 21:21.004
I'm gonna buy it,
I'm gonna lease it out.

21:21.037 --> 21:22.340
-It's a piece of shit.
-(Donna laughs)

21:22.373 --> 21:23.577
It's got, like, seven cracks

21:23.610 --> 21:24.946
-in the foundation.
-Congratulations.

21:24.979 --> 21:27.518
Yeah, but the thing is,
the guy doesn't have a realtor.

21:27.551 --> 21:30.557
Hey, I thought if
you needed help again.
-Oh, no. No, no, no. No.

21:30.590 --> 21:31.926
Yeah, but this could be
a chance for us to--

21:31.959 --> 21:33.630
No, I don't need it.
I don't need it.

21:33.663 --> 21:35.366
Thank you, though.
I appreciate it.
I got it handled.

21:35.399 --> 21:37.370
-Okay, but everybody
wins, you know.
-MIKEY: Excuse me.

21:37.403 --> 21:39.942
-DONNA: Yeah. Nobody wins.
-You make a deal,
I'll make a deal...

21:40.476 --> 21:42.815
-We get to, you know,
do it together.
-DONNA: Oh, yeah.

21:42.848 --> 21:44.785
-Yeah. Thanks, though.
-That's a good idea.

21:44.818 --> 21:46.990
-Think about it, okay?
-DONNA: Okay.

21:47.023 --> 21:48.926
So, guys, are we
really doing this again?

21:49.728 --> 21:51.932
I'm just,
I'm cleaning up a mess here.

21:52.701 --> 21:53.837
(Mikey sighs)

21:53.870 --> 21:55.607
Yeah, you are a mess, Lee.

21:55.640 --> 21:56.842
-DONNA:
Oh, you know what, Michael?
-What?

21:56.876 --> 21:59.414
-That's not very nice. Michael.
-MIKEY: Is that not very nice?

21:59.447 --> 22:01.151
What happened to the
Christmas spirit in this house?

22:01.184 --> 22:03.388
-DONNA: I don't know.
-It's gone. I can't find it.

22:08.900 --> 22:10.637
Yo. Yo, yo, yo. Oh.

22:10.670 --> 22:11.872
(softly) Uncle J. Uncle J.

22:12.373 --> 22:13.308
(whispering)
Why are we whispering?

22:13.342 --> 22:15.379
(whispering)
Oh, I just wanted to talk to you

22:15.412 --> 22:16.649
about that thing from earlier.

22:17.050 --> 22:18.052
What thing from earlier?

22:18.085 --> 22:21.391
The... the job.
The job thing.

22:21.424 --> 22:22.695
(loudly)
Oh, the job from earlier!

22:22.728 --> 22:23.863
Come on, don't be an asshole.

22:23.896 --> 22:26.636
Come on.
I'm-I'm being real with you.

22:26.669 --> 22:31.512
Oh. Okay. In that case,
I gotta put on my real face.

22:31.545 --> 22:33.549
-Jimmy.
-CICERO: What did I say earlier?

22:34.250 --> 22:35.654
You said we'd
talk about it later.

22:35.687 --> 22:36.789
And now it's later.

22:37.123 --> 22:38.759
Very good. So shoot.

22:39.495 --> 22:40.731
Alright.

22:40.764 --> 22:41.933
I'm about to have this kid.

22:41.966 --> 22:44.538
I don't wanna be

It's-it's a fucking nightmare.

30:08.491 --> 30:09.895
-Like, trust me,
I'm doing you a favor.
-Yo.

30:09.928 --> 30:12.333
And I'd love to hear your ideas.
I would.

30:12.366 --> 30:14.203
I-I-I wanna hear
about you, I do.

30:14.236 --> 30:15.439
Also I don't need
you fuckin'...

30:15.472 --> 30:17.042
I don't need you
talking to Claire

30:17.075 --> 30:18.579
and acting all nice if you
don't actually give a fuck.

30:18.612 --> 30:19.614
You know?

30:20.415 --> 30:21.417
Wh-what?

30:22.319 --> 30:24.925
What are you talking about
I-I don't give a fuck?

30:24.958 --> 30:26.293
Why would you say that to me?

30:27.497 --> 30:29.100
Carmy, I give like a...

30:29.133 --> 30:30.569
I give like a huge fuck.

30:32.206 --> 30:33.509
-Yeah?
-Yeah. Fuck, yeah.

30:33.542 --> 30:34.912
-(timer ringing)
-DONNA: God fucking dammit!

30:34.945 --> 30:36.347
I mean, I give... I-I...

30:37.483 --> 30:39.420
I give like the biggest fuck.

30:43.361 --> 30:44.665
-Alright.
-Alright?

30:44.698 --> 30:45.633
Okay.

30:46.434 --> 30:47.504
Yeah.

30:47.537 --> 30:48.505
Hey, don't...

30:49.708 --> 30:51.679
I um, I got you...

30:51.712 --> 30:53.481
I got, uh, it's stupid.
I got you...

30:53.849 --> 30:55.987
-What?
-Actually, I got you something.

30:56.020 --> 30:58.024
-Can I give it to you?
-What, you got me a present?

30:58.057 --> 30:59.595
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I got you a present.
Just one second.

30:59.628 --> 31:00.930
Alright.

31:12.286 --> 31:13.187
Whoa.

31:13.555 --> 31:15.493
-Yo.
-What's this?

31:17.530 --> 31:19.333
Wait, before I, uh...

31:20.435 --> 31:22.106
why don't you give me, like,

31:22.139 --> 31:25.111
like, three things
about Copenhagen, man?

31:26.314 --> 31:27.416
Tell me.

31:27.449 --> 31:29.253
I don't know. Uh...

31:29.286 --> 31:30.355
MIKEY: Anything.

31:32.727 --> 31:34.397
It's the most beautiful place
I've ever seen.

31:34.430 --> 31:35.398
MIKEY: Yeah.

31:36.133 --> 31:37.002
Uh...

31:40.275 --> 31:41.678
I slept on a boat.

31:43.281 --> 31:44.249
And, uh...

31:47.055 --> 31:48.258
I fed an invisible cat.

31:48.291 --> 31:49.226
MIKEY: Hmm.

31:52.232 --> 31:53.267
Well, Carm...

31:54.236 --> 31:55.305
that's a home run.

31:55.338 --> 31:56.407
Yeah. Out of the park.

31:56.440 --> 31:57.577
MIKEY: Out of the park.

31:57.610 --> 31:58.713
Alright, go ahead.
Go ahead, go ahead.

31:58.746 --> 31:59.981
MIKEY: What is this?

32:06.027 --> 32:07.362
Oh, Carmy, that's a...

32:07.764 --> 32:09.300
It's like, it's like
a little bit rough,

32:09.333 --> 32:10.537
but I don't know,
it's something--

32:10.570 --> 32:11.671
No, man, that's...

32:13.709 --> 32:15.178
It's beautiful. That's...

32:16.047 --> 32:17.182
That's perfect.

32:19.486 --> 32:21.123
Yeah, Mike, we could, um...

32:23.762 --> 32:25.332
We could do this, you know.

-CARMY: Yeah.
-Yeah.

32:30.075 --> 32:31.010
Yeah, let it rip.

32:32.747 --> 32:33.783
Yeah, let it rip.

32:33.816 --> 32:35.151
Yeah, Carm.

32:37.356 --> 32:39.728
DONNA:
Carm, where the fuck
are the saltines?

32:39.761 --> 32:41.263
-I gotta get the thing.
-MIKEY: Okay.

what I'm telling you though?

-STEVEN: Yes. Okay.
The woman says what to you?
-MICHELLE: Okay?

33:45.693 --> 33:47.497
And then she said again.

33:47.530 --> 33:48.532
"What is your last name?"

33:48.565 --> 33:50.135
And I'm like,
"Fucking Berzatto."

33:50.168 --> 33:52.373

33:56.314 --> 33:57.383
You're an asshole.

33:57.416 --> 33:59.153
And then she's,
and then she's like,

33:59.186 --> 34:01.257
"I bet you know
a lot about bears."

34:01.290 --> 34:03.729
God damn her for thinking
that you know about bears.

34:03.762 --> 34:04.831
Yeah. Damn her.

34:04.864 --> 34:07.469
And how did
that incredibly deep,

34:07.503 --> 34:09.541
incredibly penetrating insult
make you feel?

34:09.574 --> 34:11.545
-Like I was gonna
roll that bitch.
-Yeah, roll that bitch.

34:11.578 --> 34:13.348
Okay, now I feel like you're
missing some details here.

34:13.381 --> 34:15.352
You want... Okay.
You wanted to fight this woman?

34:15.385 --> 34:16.555
So were you being
an asshole maybe?

34:16.588 --> 34:17.657
What do you mean?

34:17.690 --> 34:19.528
Well, you just said
that you wanted to fight her,

34:19.561 --> 34:22.132
so I asked if perhaps
it was you that was the asshole.

34:22.165 --> 34:24.805
Um, are you listening?
Hello? I am not the asshole.

34:24.838 --> 34:26.441
-She's the asshole?
-That is a fact.

34:26.474 --> 34:28.546
And you go around
rolling assholes.

34:28.579 --> 34:29.548
That is also a fact.

34:29.581 --> 34:30.883
Okay, I'm caught up.

34:30.916 --> 34:33.556
Okay. Anyway,
so-so she says to me,

34:33.589 --> 34:37.429
She finally says to me,
"My friend who passed away--"

34:37.462 --> 34:39.300
-FAK: Sorry for your loss.
-It's not her friend.

34:39.333 --> 34:41.471
MICHELLE: You don't
have to apologize to me, dude.

34:41.505 --> 34:43.475
I don't know this fucking woman.

34:43.509 --> 34:45.713
-This woman was, like, annoying.
-RICHIE: Pay attention, Neil.
Pay attention.

34:45.746 --> 34:48.451
Why don't you listen
to my story?

34:48.484 --> 34:50.757
He's gotten to know her so well.
This story is taking so long.

34:50.790 --> 34:51.625
Yeah, but it doesn't matter.
It doesn't matter.

34:51.659 --> 34:53.161
The point is,
she finally says to me,

34:53.194 --> 34:54.463
"I have a friend
who passed away.

34:54.497 --> 34:56.769
"She was a biologist,
and she studied bears.

34:56.802 --> 35:00.274
"And did you know that bears
are kind and-and sensitive

35:00.642 --> 35:04.651
"and devoted and also, um,
altruistic and empathetic

35:04.684 --> 35:07.624
"and-and very commonly known
to be adept at grieving?

35:07.657 --> 35:10.462
-Is this true?
-How the fuck
would I possibly know?

35:10.496 --> 35:12.600
I-I couldn't tell
if this bitch was trying
to fuck with me or not.

35:12.633 --> 35:15.238
Did you say to her, just be kind
and empathetic like a bear?

35:15.271 --> 35:17.510
-Yes, I did.
-RICHIE: That all
does check out.

35:17.543 --> 35:19.312
I share a lot
of those traits actually.

35:19.680 --> 35:22.219
Also, it is important to note

35:22.252 --> 35:24.891
that bears are incredibly,
incredibly aggressive.

35:24.924 --> 35:26.327
And how were you
related to them again?

35:26.360 --> 35:27.262
-Through friendship.
-TED: Yeah.

35:27.295 --> 35:28.733
-Like us.
-Not like you.

35:28.766 --> 35:30.636
FAK: Yeah. We're related
through friendship.

35:30.669 --> 35:32.607
-Whoa, whoa, whoa.
-Whoa, whoa, whoa.

35:32.640 --> 35:35.680
I was hiking once
in Northern California,

35:35.713 --> 35:38.686
and I saw a bear run up
a tree so goddamn fast,

35:38.719 --> 35:40.656
and I did not like it at all.

35:40.689 --> 35:43.228
When were you in
Northern California?

35:43.261 --> 35:45.666
Um, most of my life
before we met?

35:45.699 --> 35:47.236
And very weird that you are now

35:47.269 --> 35:48.906
acting like I never told you
I'm from California.

35:48.939 --> 35:50.275
What's super weird is that

35:50.308 --> 35:51.845
you just said
Northern California.

35:51.878 --> 35:52.914
That was weird how I said it.

35:52.947 --> 35:54.518
I thought it sounded elegant.

35:54.551 --> 35:55.787
-Super elegant.

39:01.457 --> 39:03.394
-MIKEY: We didn't know
where the fuck we were.
-FAK: Well, you were rocked.

39:03.427 --> 39:04.831
We're in a foreign land.
You know what I mean?

39:04.864 --> 39:06.835
And it's like, you know,
you can't read shit

39:06.868 --> 39:09.039
because it's all, like,
a different fucking alphabet.

39:09.072 --> 39:10.843
You can't fucking,
like, understand shit.

39:10.876 --> 39:14.416
We just know we gotta get
to a fucking ATM, you know.

39:14.449 --> 39:16.688
We've heard this story
a million times.

39:20.729 --> 39:22.065
-I'm sorry?
-The story.

39:22.098 --> 39:24.537
-Yeah, what?
-We've heard it a million times.

39:27.576 --> 39:29.446
No, Lee, like, you have.

39:29.479 --> 39:31.050
-And cousin has.
-I haven't.

39:31.083 --> 39:32.920
-I have, but I like it.
-It's a good story.

39:32.953 --> 39:34.824
Yeah, Lee,
chill out or fuck off.

39:34.857 --> 39:36.060
-Keep going.
-Let us tell the fucking story.

39:36.093 --> 39:37.597
Anyways, we have to find an ATM.

39:37.630 --> 39:39.066
LEE: No no no,
I'll finish it. I'll finish it.

39:39.099 --> 39:41.805
You sold the car,
and then at the end,

39:41.838 --> 39:43.107
you find the horse.

39:45.879 --> 39:48.652
Good for you, Lee,
that's... that's great.

39:49.921 --> 39:51.625
You're like a real,
genuine fucking asshole.

39:51.658 --> 39:53.027
Because-because
I cut off the story that

39:53.060 --> 39:54.129
you've told a million times?

39:54.162 --> 39:55.599
Why don't you finish
a business plan?

39:55.632 --> 39:56.868
Alright, that's enough.

39:56.901 --> 39:58.839
Where's the tomato sauce
prospectus, Michael?

39:58.872 --> 40:01.444
-Where's the frozen pizza plan?
-MICHELLE:
Come on, you're veering.

40:01.477 --> 40:02.613
That's, uh, that's enough.

40:02.646 --> 40:03.648
It's okay.

40:04.751 --> 40:06.554
-Hi, Unc.
-CICERO: Hey, honey.

40:07.723 --> 40:08.925
Fuck's going on in here?

40:09.927 --> 40:11.898
This jagoff's talkin' shit.

40:11.931 --> 40:14.169
-Yeah? Which jagoff?
-This jagoff.

40:14.202 --> 40:15.706
CICERO: What about, jagoff?

40:15.739 --> 40:18.645
That is, I guess about
how I, like, don't finish shit.

40:18.678 --> 40:20.783
Not stories. He finishes
those over and over.

40:20.816 --> 40:21.918
Mikey, I mean, come on.

40:21.951 --> 40:24.222
-MIKEY: Perfect.
-PETE: Ho, ho, ho!

40:25.826 --> 40:27.162
We got a tuna casserole delivery

40:27.195 --> 40:28.699
from the North Pole here.

40:28.732 --> 40:30.736
-Speaking of jagoffs.
-STEVEN: Hey.

40:30.769 --> 40:32.472
PETE:
Mikey, what is up, bro?

40:32.874 --> 40:34.644
You know
it's seven fishes, right, Pete?

40:34.677 --> 40:35.646
Yeah, I know.
That's why I brought this.

40:35.679 --> 40:37.015
That's the eighth fish, bro.

40:37.048 --> 40:38.519
Oh, what,
we can't have one more?

40:38.552 --> 40:40.121
LEE: That makes
absolutely no sense.

40:40.154 --> 40:41.891
I mean, I can't even
figure the logic of that.

40:42.927 --> 40:44.029
What?

40:44.897 --> 40:46.466
You're so fucked.

40:47.803 --> 40:49.541
Uh... 'Sup, Steve?

40:49.574 --> 40:50.876
Hey, Pete,
thanks for bringing fish.

40:50.909 --> 40:52.647
-PETE: Yeah, thanks.
-CARMY: (claps) Hey, family.

40:52.680 --> 40:53.949
Come on, let's sit.
Okay, dinner's ready, alright.

40:53.982 --> 40:55.519
-Hey, no way, Carmy!
-Hey.

40:55.552 --> 40:56.788
-What's up, brother?
-Hey, hey, hey.

40:56.821 --> 40:57.957
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What is that? What is that?

40:57.990 --> 40:59.594
-Don't tell him.
-MIKEY: What do you mean
don't tell him?

40:59.627 --> 41:00.896
It's nothing. It's nothing.

41:00.929 --> 41:02.734
Steve? Steve? Stevie?
What is that? What is it?

41:02.767 --> 41:04.203
You're gonna be upset,
but his heart was
in the right place, Carm.

41:04.236 --> 41:05.772
-It's a tuna casserole.
-What--

41:07.977 --> 41:09.814
-It's seven fishes. Pete.
-PETE: I know.

41:09.847 --> 41:11.952
-They didn't communicate--
-CARMY: This would
make eight fishes.

41:11.985 --> 41:13.221
That-that would
make us assholes, right?

41:13.254 --> 41:14.456
I already told him that.

41:14.490 --> 41:16.695
-MICHELLE: Swing and a miss.
-Why are you doing this to me?

41:16.728 --> 41:18.197
-PETE: Okay. I--
-Just don't let her
fuckin' see it.

41:18.230 --> 41:19.901
-I--
-Don't let her fucking see it.

41:19.934 --> 41:21.538
I didn't know because...

41:21.571 --> 41:22.573
What's up, bro?

41:22.606 --> 41:23.842
-Hey, Rich.
-Hey.

41:23.875 --> 41:25.245
-I'm so happy to see you.
-Hey, there's my girl.

41:25.278 --> 41:27.249
Oh, my God.

41:27.282 --> 41:28.986
-Merry Christmas.
-What the fuck is that?

41:29.019 --> 41:30.723
-Um...
-No. Pete.

41:30.756 --> 41:32.593
Pete, I told you
not to fucking do this.

41:32.626 --> 41:34.531
I know, but... Well, I can't
show up empty-handed.

41:34.564 --> 41:35.665
SUGAR: Ugh, it stinks.

41:38.237 --> 41:39.172
Fuck!

41:43.849 --> 41:45.586
Well, merry Christmas, guys.

41:45.619 --> 41:46.588
Maybe somewhere.

41:46.621 --> 41:48.859
I understand you were
just trying to be nice.

41:48.892 --> 41:50.161
Thanks, Steve.

41:50.930 --> 41:52.733
Good lights in
the neighborhood this year.

41:52.766 --> 41:54.002
LEE: Same as last year.

41:54.035 --> 41:55.004
PETE: No, there's more
this year. I noticed--

41:55.037 --> 41:56.072
LEE:
Really, you counted 'em?

41:56.106 --> 41:58.344
Do the Andersons still live
on the corner there?

41:58.377 --> 41:59.948
-They're doing it up.
-They died.

41:59.981 --> 42:01.217
You knock on every door?

42:01.250 --> 42:02.318
Okay.

42:02.686 --> 42:04.123
Is the bathroom
still right here?

42:04.156 --> 42:05.324
Yep. It's over there.

42:10.368 --> 42:11.904
-MICHELLE: Hey.
-Hey.

42:12.372 --> 42:13.675
MICHELLE: How you doing?

42:14.209 --> 42:15.846
-Yeah, you know...
-You okay?

42:16.581 --> 42:18.017
I've been wanting
to talk to you.

42:18.050 --> 42:19.754
You've been
running around like crazy.

42:19.787 --> 42:20.756
CARMY:
Yeah, it's a lot, so...

42:20.789 --> 42:21.924
Yeah, it's a lot.

42:22.927 --> 42:23.862
CARMY: Yeah.

42:25.198 --> 42:26.667
I have this idea

42:27.368 --> 42:29.339
and I just wonder
if maybe you'd be open to it.

42:29.707 --> 42:31.343
-What's up?
-MICHELLE:
Like for your own good.

42:32.680 --> 42:33.882
What is it? What is it?

42:34.884 --> 42:36.119
You wanna come stay with me

42:36.486 --> 42:38.057
for, like, a couple of days
in New York?

42:38.090 --> 42:39.025
Just like...

42:40.161 --> 42:41.765
get the fuck outta here?

42:41.798 --> 42:43.234
-Yeah.
-MICHELLE: You know.

42:43.267 --> 42:45.371
I think it's really
important for you to

42:45.404 --> 42:47.141
keep your head in the game,
you know.

42:47.643 --> 42:51.016
Stay focused. Keep your eye
on the motherfuckin' prize.

42:51.049 --> 42:52.753
Yeah. No, I hear you. Um...

42:54.022 --> 42:55.257
Yeah, no, I'd like that.

42:55.892 --> 42:57.863
I'm gonna kinda
hold you to it, Carm.

42:58.230 --> 42:59.900
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

43:00.301 --> 43:02.773
This is, um, this isn't
good for your head.

43:02.806 --> 43:03.876
It's not good
for anyone's head,

43:03.909 --> 43:05.044
but it's really
not good for yours.

43:06.814 --> 43:08.150
-Yeah, I know, I know.
-Yeah, so...

43:08.183 --> 43:09.920
But you know, what are you
supposed to do? You know?

43:11.123 --> 43:12.325
You gotta get outta here.

43:13.260 --> 43:14.864
That's what you gotta do.

43:14.897 --> 43:17.168
You just come stay with me
any time you want.

43:18.304 --> 43:20.041
I got a couple of restaurants.

43:20.074 --> 43:21.678
I mean, I'm an idiot
about this shit,

43:21.711 --> 43:22.813
but I think they're very good.

43:22.846 --> 43:24.283
-You like 'em? Yeah.
-I do.

43:24.316 --> 43:27.756
And then that way
you can just, like, decompress.

43:30.127 --> 43:32.199
-Okay?
-Okay.

43:32.232 --> 43:34.971
I see what happens here,
you know,

43:35.004 --> 43:36.741
and I can see
how it gets in your head.

43:37.309 --> 43:38.811
-Yeah.
-And I don't want that for you.

43:39.445 --> 43:40.447
-Okay. Thank you.
-MICHELLE: Okay?

43:40.481 --> 43:43.353
-Yeah.
-So you're gonna come?
Stay with me?

43:45.759 --> 43:46.727
I'll try.

43:50.234 --> 43:51.336
Thank you.

43:51.638 --> 43:52.940
Keep going.

43:54.844 --> 43:55.813
I hear you.

43:55.846 --> 43:57.081
-Okay.
-Okay.

43:59.019 --> 44:01.022
-MICHELLE: Love you.
-Alright, you too.

44:05.899 --> 44:08.839
RICHIE: Oh wow. Nice.

44:08.872 --> 44:10.475
TIFF: Just keeps goin'.

44:10.509 --> 44:12.279
RICHIE:
Table looks great, D.

44:12.312 --> 44:13.815
What do you want?
Where should we?

44:13.848 --> 44:14.951
-RICHIE: Hey, we're over there.
-TIFF: Okay, cool.

44:14.984 --> 44:16.755
Fuck me with a stick.

44:16.788 --> 44:18.390
-RICHIE: Scooch forward.
-Okay.

44:19.961 --> 44:21.096
Oh. You're sweet.

44:22.398 --> 44:23.367
Thank you for that.

44:23.400 --> 44:24.704
Okay.

44:24.737 --> 44:25.906
CICERO:
You feeling better, hon?

44:26.240 --> 44:27.409
Yeah. Yeah. Thanks, Unc.

44:27.442 --> 44:29.112
I think a banana is about

44:29.145 --> 44:31.283
all I can handle right now.

44:31.316 --> 44:32.753
Maybe about
all I can handle, too.

44:32.786 --> 44:34.255
I sense this getting dark.

44:35.124 --> 44:38.097
-God, you got that feeling?
-CICERO: Mm-hmm.

44:38.130 --> 44:39.166
Oh, yeah, I got that feeling.

44:39.199 --> 44:40.301
I'm right there with you, Unc.

44:40.334 --> 44:42.940
We lit.
This Christmas is lit.

44:43.509 --> 44:45.411
You ever have
a chocolate-covered
banana, Tiff?

44:45.444 --> 44:46.915
Yeah, of course I have.

44:46.948 --> 44:48.751
You know, the drive
out here we actually, uh,

44:49.085 --> 44:51.023
we passed the stand

44:51.056 --> 44:53.393
my dad used to
take me to get 'em.

44:53.695 --> 44:56.233
I swear to God, I can
smell 'em, you know, and him.

44:56.535 --> 44:58.839
-TIFF: (chuckles softly) Hmm.
-It's weird, right?

44:58.872 --> 45:02.279
We remember smells.
Cologne, you know.

45:02.312 --> 45:05.786
Anyway, it's kinda been,
uh, sitting with me, you know,

45:05.819 --> 45:07.790
-sitting on my chest.
-TIFF: Mm-hmm. Yeah.

45:07.823 --> 45:09.326
And all of a sudden,
after all these years,

45:09.359 --> 45:10.294
I'm missing that fat fuck.

45:11.296 --> 45:13.301
Anyway, and here you are,
you're eating a banana.

45:13.334 --> 45:14.970
-Anyways, kinda funny.
-Well...

45:15.505 --> 45:17.342
Funny that
it's the holidays, too.

45:17.375 --> 45:18.410
-You know.
-CICERO: Hmm.

45:19.112 --> 45:20.883
All comes back up,
doesn't it?

45:20.916 --> 45:22.052
It sure does come back up.

45:22.085 --> 45:23.154
-CICERO: Oh, boy.
-Oh.

45:23.187 --> 45:24.957
-CICERO: Oh, I get it.
-(Tiff laughs)

45:24.990 --> 45:26.761
-That's clever.
-Is it clever or gross?

45:26.794 --> 45:29.132
-(indistinct chatter)
-(laughter)

45:31.838 --> 45:33.474
(indistinct chatter)

45:33.508 --> 45:36.413
-Do you mind sitting
at the kiddie table?
-I don't mind at all.

45:36.446 --> 45:38.084
MICHELLE:
You can sit at the kiddie table.

45:38.117 --> 45:39.920
-I would prefer to sit
at the kiddie table.
-(laughter)

45:41.123 --> 45:42.492
Who wants wine?
Want some wine?

45:42.526 --> 45:44.763
FAK:
...understand the market.

45:45.097 --> 45:48.170
MICHELLE:
It has a lovely bouquet.

45:48.203 --> 45:49.841
I like your shirt,
it looks good.

45:49.874 --> 45:51.343
He looks like Clark Kent
in his glasses.

45:53.380 --> 45:55.885
(indistinct conversations)

45:59.292 --> 46:02.298
Oh. Oh, I'm such an asshole.
I wanted to say thank you.

46:02.331 --> 46:04.102
-What for, darling?
-Oh, for giving Richie a chance.

46:04.135 --> 46:05.304
Oh, what? No, no, no. Wh...

46:05.337 --> 46:06.908
-Uh, babe. Um...
-TIFF: What? Wh...

46:06.941 --> 46:08.377
-You're embarrassed to say it?
-RICHIE: No, no, no, no.

46:08.410 --> 46:09.847
-I can't talk about it?
-It's just not
public information yet.

46:09.880 --> 46:11.116
-Just wanted to say thank you.
-We're just...

46:11.149 --> 46:12.520
-What's not public information?
-RICHIE: Uh...

46:12.553 --> 46:14.256
You know, Tiff and I
were talking earlier,

46:14.289 --> 46:15.526
and I was just letting her know
a little bit about how--

46:15.559 --> 46:16.528
What's not public information?

46:16.561 --> 46:18.130
-Just how like when we...
-CICERO: Richard.

46:18.163 --> 46:19.399
Richard, shut the fuck up.

46:19.432 --> 46:20.969
Richard,
I'm talking to Tiffany.

46:21.002 --> 46:22.138
I know, but we were
just saying, like, um...

46:22.171 --> 46:24.375
CICERO:
Richard... shut up.

46:24.844 --> 46:26.814
I'm having a conversation
with your wife.

46:27.783 --> 46:29.620
-Tiffany, what were
you saying, my dear?
-Wh... Yeah.

46:29.653 --> 46:31.390
I don't know what the fuck
is going on here,

46:31.423 --> 46:32.425
'cause I was just
gonna thank you

46:32.458 --> 46:33.528
for giving Richie a job.

46:33.561 --> 46:35.264
See, that's not entirely...

46:35.297 --> 46:36.534
-TIFF: It's not true?
-RICHIE: No.

46:36.567 --> 46:37.703
Is that not
what's happening here?

46:37.736 --> 46:39.874
-RICHIE: It's not not true.
-TIFF: He told me that...

46:39.907 --> 46:41.109
Un-fucking-believable.

46:41.778 --> 46:43.848
-He told you I gave him a job?
-Yeah, he told me he...

46:44.550 --> 46:46.220
Yeah, he told me
that you gave him a job.

46:46.253 --> 46:47.221
CICERO: Okay, look.

46:49.058 --> 46:50.027
Here's the truth, alright?

46:50.060 --> 46:51.898
I mean, you know,
I'm a big fan of this guy.

46:51.931 --> 46:53.133
I believe in him. I do.

47:00.582 --> 47:02.586
Which is precisely why
I gave him a fucking job.

47:02.619 --> 47:04.088
Right?

47:05.458 --> 47:07.929
Thing is, I just wanna
keep a lid on it for now

47:08.531 --> 47:11.571
because I don't want
every jagoff in all of the land

47:11.604 --> 47:13.274
to know that I have
all these jobs to give out,

47:13.307 --> 47:14.275
which I don't.

47:14.944 --> 47:16.313
Alright?

47:16.346 --> 47:17.415
Right, Richard?

47:19.285 --> 47:21.524
-Yeah.
-I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

47:21.557 --> 47:23.194
-I didn't know I wasn't
supposed to say anything.
-No, no.

47:23.227 --> 47:25.131
My darling, how could you know?

47:25.164 --> 47:26.467
TIFF: And I promise you,
I will not say,

47:26.501 --> 47:28.905
I will not say a word
until you say that it's okay.

47:28.938 --> 47:31.042
But I just wanna say
thank you so much

47:31.544 --> 47:33.347
'cause we really
appreciate you.

47:33.380 --> 47:34.583
And I appreciate you, too.

47:36.219 --> 47:37.455
The both of you.

47:37.488 --> 47:38.658
(indistinct chatter)

47:40.327 --> 47:41.897
(mouths) Thank you.

47:45.204 --> 47:46.139
TIFF: Oh, yeah.

47:47.943 --> 47:49.346
Like, do I have to wait?
Can I pick?

47:49.379 --> 47:50.616
CARMY:
She'll be out in a minute.

47:50.649 --> 47:52.018
She'll be out in a minute,
I think.

47:52.051 --> 47:53.220
-MICHELLE: Can I pick?
-Yeah, yeah.

47:53.253 --> 47:54.489
Do you care?

47:54.523 --> 47:55.457
CAROL: Go for it.

47:55.491 --> 47:57.563
MICHELLE:
Don't we have
to say grace?

47:57.596 --> 47:59.465
-CARMY: Yeah, she'll, she'll be,
she'll just be a minute.
-Yeah.

48:01.069 --> 48:02.271
(sniffles sharply)

48:03.541 --> 48:04.475
(sighs)

48:05.044 --> 48:06.714
-(sniffles)
-CARMY: What's up, Ma?

48:06.747 --> 48:08.384
(coughs)

48:08.417 --> 48:09.485
I'm fine.

48:10.755 --> 48:12.057
I'm good.

48:13.160 --> 48:14.362
CARMY: Hey.

48:14.395 --> 48:15.464
(Carmy clears throat)

48:16.033 --> 48:18.505
Everybody's sitting down now.

48:18.538 --> 48:20.207
You know,
everything looks so beautiful.

48:26.554 --> 48:29.091
I don't think I can
do this by myself anymore.

48:30.762 --> 48:32.364
You're not
by yourself, alright?

48:33.433 --> 48:36.139
I'm right here with you.

48:36.172 --> 48:37.943
DONNA:
Well, yeah, now, but...

48:39.713 --> 48:41.350
Nobody out there
gives a shit about me.

48:41.383 --> 48:42.384
CARMY: That's not true.

48:45.057 --> 48:46.995
That's not true.
We all love you so much.

48:47.028 --> 48:48.498
(indistinct conversations)

48:51.504 --> 48:53.106
I had to beg you to come home.

48:55.579 --> 48:57.047
I'm happy to be here.

48:58.050 --> 49:00.154
Okay?

49:00.187 --> 49:02.526
I am. Mom, I'm really
happy to see you.

49:03.595 --> 49:05.197
Hey. Really.

49:06.066 --> 49:07.268
Okay?

49:07.301 --> 49:08.671
-(cries) Okay.
-CARMY: Okay.

49:09.038 --> 49:11.143
-(sniffles)
-Okay. It's okay.

49:11.176 --> 49:13.246
I just, I worked
all day for them.

49:13.648 --> 49:16.085
-I worked all day.
-I know. I know.

49:16.587 --> 49:19.091
Everybody-everybody
really appreciates it, too.

49:20.160 --> 49:21.630
DONNA:
It's just fucking hard.

49:24.335 --> 49:26.105
CARMY: (sighs)
Why, um...

49:27.475 --> 49:29.412
What's hard? What's hard, Mom?
What is it?

49:33.086 --> 49:35.157
I make things
beautiful for them...

49:38.330 --> 49:39.232
and...

49:40.001 --> 49:42.404
no one makes things
beautiful for me.

49:50.722 --> 49:52.191
Okay. Um...

49:53.661 --> 49:54.496
Look, I'm gonna go, uh,

49:54.530 --> 49:55.598
I'm gonna go...
I'm gonna sit down now.

49:55.632 --> 49:57.536
Why don't you give me
your hand and we'll go sit?

49:57.569 --> 49:58.538
-We'll go sit.
-No. Okay.

49:58.571 --> 49:59.674
CARMY:
Come on, Mom. Come on.

49:59.707 --> 50:01.242
I'll go in a minute.

50:03.080 --> 50:04.149
CARMY: Alright.
Well, I'll just wait.

50:04.182 --> 50:05.050
-I'll wait for you.
-Okay, Michael.

50:06.186 --> 50:07.321
I'll be there in a minute.

50:10.127 --> 50:11.195
I said go.

50:13.501 --> 50:15.371
CARMY: Okay. Um...

50:15.404 --> 50:17.108
-I said go.
-CARMY: Are you good?

50:17.141 --> 50:19.746
I'm good. Go. Go sit.

50:22.519 --> 50:24.188
How about I just wait with you?
I'll wait.

50:24.957 --> 50:27.630
Why are you treating me
like a child?

50:27.663 --> 50:29.567
CARMY: I'm not, I'm not
treating you like a child, Mom.

50:29.600 --> 50:30.602
I'm not.

50:31.771 --> 50:33.073
Do we have a problem?

50:34.409 --> 50:36.648
Do we, do we have a problem?

50:36.681 --> 50:39.085
DONNA:
Do we have a problem...

50:40.387 --> 50:43.226
Carmen Anthony Berzatto?

50:44.228 --> 50:46.232
Do we have a problem?

50:47.836 --> 50:49.105
No.

50:49.439 --> 50:50.440
DONNA: Good.

50:51.510 --> 50:52.579
CARMY: Oh. Mom.

50:56.587 --> 50:57.856
It's okay. It's okay.

50:58.223 --> 50:59.894
-(Donna crying)
-It's okay. It's okay.

50:59.927 --> 51:01.463
-It's okay, okay?
-(kisses)

51:01.497 --> 51:02.832
It's okay.

51:04.168 --> 51:05.271
DONNA: Go sit down.

51:05.304 --> 51:06.473
-Go sit down.
-Alright.

51:06.507 --> 51:09.780
♪ We did last summer ♪

51:11.517 --> 51:15.792
♪ I'll remember ♪

51:15.825 --> 51:22.605
♪ All winter long ♪

51:24.475 --> 51:26.780
(vocalizing)

51:30.755 --> 51:32.358
(sniffles sharply)

51:37.168 --> 51:38.838
MIKEY: Hey, uh, Tiff.

51:38.871 --> 51:41.577
A little, um a little
something came up, huh?

51:41.610 --> 51:43.447
A little bit
more than something.

51:43.480 --> 51:45.184
-MIKEY: Oh, boy.
-TIFF: Yeah.

51:45.217 --> 51:46.854
-You feeling okay?
-I'm good.

51:46.887 --> 51:48.591
-MIKEY: Yeah? Good.
-How are you?

51:48.624 --> 51:50.361
-Good.
-MICHELLE: Hey, Mikey.

51:50.394 --> 51:52.599
-Yeah?
-You wanna say grace?

51:54.268 --> 51:55.471
MIKEY:
I don't know, cousin.

51:55.505 --> 51:57.408
Is this motherfucker
gonna cut me off?

51:57.910 --> 51:59.513
(clears throat) It depends.

51:59.546 --> 52:01.884
Uh, is it a grace we've
heard a million times before?

52:01.917 --> 52:04.222
-CICERO: Okay. Okay.
-Oh, wow.

52:04.255 --> 52:07.496
Uh, Steven, would you like
to say grace, my friend?

52:07.529 --> 52:09.465
-MICHELLE: Oh.
-Can I please not?

52:10.267 --> 52:11.704
-MICHELLE: You don't want to?
-I don't.

52:11.737 --> 52:12.873
-Okay.
-I mean...

52:12.906 --> 52:14.342
Okay, so then I'm going to ask

52:14.375 --> 52:15.912
the same question
I ask every year,

52:15.945 --> 52:19.352
which is, what the hell is
the point of the seven fishes?

52:19.385 --> 52:20.889
-I don't get it.
-Oh, I know the answer.

52:20.922 --> 52:23.895
Well, it's biblical, okay?
There's seven fishes.

52:23.928 --> 52:26.768
And uh,
also by the manger, right,

52:26.801 --> 52:28.772
there's a Dutch oven of potatoes

52:28.805 --> 52:30.408
that burned the living shit
out of me earlier.

52:30.441 --> 52:32.211
-(buzzes)
-CARMY: Oh.

52:32.546 --> 52:33.915
Did you just throw a fork at me?

52:33.948 --> 52:35.183
I did.

52:35.818 --> 52:38.257
See that's the thing,
Lee, see, 'cause...

52:38.290 --> 52:39.392
you see what you did, right?

52:39.425 --> 52:40.929
You, you already did that.

52:40.962 --> 52:42.866
You remember you already
bitched about the Dutch oven?

52:42.899 --> 52:44.368
-You see, you did that before.
-Michael.

52:44.937 --> 52:46.541
-What are you doing, Michael?
-MIKEY: He started it. Uncle J.

52:46.574 --> 52:48.545
-Mike, just--
-Don't throw fuckin' forks
at people.

52:48.578 --> 52:49.747
(mocking Lee)
Don't throw forks...
Don't-don't-don't...

52:49.780 --> 52:50.949
LEE: Yeah, don't throw
forks at people.

52:50.982 --> 52:52.251
MIKEY: Don't-don't-don't.

52:52.284 --> 52:52.953
-Don't-don't-don't...
-It's a rule.

52:52.986 --> 52:54.489
It's a rule? It's a rule?

52:54.523 --> 52:56.561
Hey, Fak. You using your fork?

52:56.594 --> 52:58.229
Yeah, I-I-I need it, Mike.

52:58.865 --> 52:59.934
I need it.

52:59.967 --> 53:00.635
Ple... Mikey.

53:00.669 --> 53:02.438
-MIKEY: Yeah?
-FAK: Yeah.

53:02.471 --> 53:03.908
-MIKEY: I just,
I need to borrow it.
-Please. Please.

53:03.941 --> 53:05.277
MIKEY: I just need
to borrow it for one second.

53:05.310 --> 53:06.647
-FAK: Please.
-CICERO: Michael.

53:06.680 --> 53:08.518
I'm just gonna borrow it
for a second.

53:08.551 --> 53:10.822
-I just need it for one second.
-FAK: Mikey. Come on, dude.

53:10.855 --> 53:12.425
-CARMY: Yo.
-BOTH: Michael.

53:12.458 --> 53:13.661
I threw the fork, Lee.

53:13.694 --> 53:14.663
-STEVEN: Michael.
-MIKEY: See what I did?

53:14.696 --> 53:15.397
-I threw the fork.
-TIFF: Michael.

53:15.430 --> 53:17.268
-MIKEY: Tiff. Tiff. Shh.
-Please.

53:17.301 --> 53:19.540
Cousin, you're
scaring the normals.

53:19.573 --> 53:20.942
MIKEY:
This is fine. This is nothing.

53:20.975 --> 53:22.646
This is... It's nothing.

53:22.679 --> 53:23.782
Hey, Mikey,
can you hear me, buddy?

53:23.815 --> 53:25.283
Not right now, Stevie.

53:25.785 --> 53:27.388
-RICHIE: Cut it out.
-LEE: Rich.

53:27.421 --> 53:28.658
MIKEY: Hey, look,
here's the thing.

53:28.691 --> 53:30.394
You see, I can throw forks

53:30.427 --> 53:32.265
'cause this is
our father's house.

53:32.298 --> 53:33.267
-Mike.
-Rich.

53:33.300 --> 53:34.537
-Lee?
-My father's house.

53:34.570 --> 53:35.471
We have lift-off.

53:35.505 --> 53:36.941
LEE: Okay, you got
everyone's attention,

53:36.974 --> 53:38.878
so go ahead, tell us a story

53:38.911 --> 53:41.316
we've all heard
a million times already.

53:41.349 --> 53:42.619
-That's good, Lee.
-LEE: Yeah.

53:42.652 --> 53:44.690
Tell a story about how
you're living with your mom

53:44.723 --> 53:47.696
and you're borrowing money
off of her and any other sucker

53:47.729 --> 53:48.932
who'll listen to your bullshit.

53:48.965 --> 53:50.267
Lee, shut the fuck up.

53:50.300 --> 53:51.671
You're one of
the suckers, Jimmy.

53:51.704 --> 53:53.708
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I've told him.

53:53.741 --> 53:56.848
I told him not to listen to you.
I told him not to help.

53:56.881 --> 53:58.718
I told him to tell you
to go scratch.

53:58.751 --> 53:59.987
Thanks a whole
fucking lot, buddy.

54:00.020 --> 54:01.591
You come back next year, okay?

54:01.624 --> 54:02.993
-Motherfuck.
-Ssh, ssh, ssh. Unc, it's fine.

54:03.026 --> 54:03.995
-LEE: Yeah, it's fine.
-It's just totally fine.

54:04.028 --> 54:05.464
It's fine. It's fine.

54:05.498 --> 54:08.571
Because this guy's nothing
and he's nobody.

54:08.604 --> 54:11.711
And I know you're-you're
scared and you're afraid,
aren't you, Michael?

54:11.744 --> 54:14.048
And, Michael,
I don't know what,
what the fuck you're on,

54:14.081 --> 54:17.054
but whatever it is, if you
can hear me through the fog,

54:17.087 --> 54:18.457
throw another fork at me,

54:18.490 --> 54:19.826
you're gonna get
fuckin' rocked.

54:36.894 --> 54:38.463
Hey, Petey.

54:40.400 --> 54:41.637
I just, I...

54:42.371 --> 54:44.777
You think I could
just, like, borrow that
for one second? I just...

54:44.810 --> 54:45.912
-MICHELLE: Michael! Hey!
Come on. Mike, come on.
Please.

54:45.945 --> 54:47.415
-SUGAR: Michael!
-CARMY: Mike.

54:47.448 --> 54:48.518
CICERO: Michael.
Put the fucking fork down.

54:48.551 --> 54:50.789
-Michael. Michael. Michael.
-CICERO: Put it down.

54:50.822 --> 54:52.391
Please don't do this.

54:52.424 --> 54:53.594
Michael! Hey.

54:53.995 --> 54:55.330
Hey.

54:55.932 --> 54:56.834
Hey.

54:57.434 --> 54:58.504
Hey.

55:01.677 --> 55:02.712
I love you.

55:03.413 --> 55:04.917
Okay?

55:04.950 --> 55:06.352
I love you, too, Sug.

55:08.691 --> 55:09.793
SUGAR: I'm begging you.

55:11.664 --> 55:12.765
(whispers)
Don't do it.

55:18.945 --> 55:21.784
STEVEN: (giggles) I'm sorry.
I giggle when I get nervous.

55:21.817 --> 55:24.422
MIKEY: No, no, no. Steve,
do not apologize for that.

55:24.455 --> 55:26.059
You fucking giggle.
Fucking giggle.

55:26.092 --> 55:27.461
Fucking enjoy this.
This is fun!

55:27.496 --> 55:30.569
-Michael, I need you
to calm down, buddy, alright?
-CARMY: Mike!

55:30.602 --> 55:32.506
CICERO: There's
other people at the table.

55:32.539 --> 55:33.641
I need you to calm down.

55:33.674 --> 55:34.843
You're being
a bit of an asshole.

55:34.876 --> 55:36.681
Thank you, Uncle J.
I'm fine.

55:36.714 --> 55:38.851
That is the familial support
I was looking for.

55:38.884 --> 55:40.555
Yeah, well, you're being
a fuckin' asshole, too.

55:40.588 --> 55:42.693
Thank you for that too, Uncle J.

55:42.726 --> 55:43.928
Go ahead.

55:44.195 --> 55:46.466
-Let's go.
-Where do you wanna go, Lee?

55:46.500 --> 55:48.069
-LEE: Fuckin' throw it.
-Yeah?

55:49.706 --> 55:51.844
Yeah, throw it or put it down.

55:51.877 --> 55:53.982
(Mikey laughs)

55:54.015 --> 55:54.983
Yeah, come on.

55:55.317 --> 55:57.555
MIKEY: Well, Lee,
you look like you bite.

55:57.989 --> 55:59.693
You bite, Lee,
is that what you do?

55:59.726 --> 56:01.697
-MICHELLE: Oh, my God.
-CICERO: For fuck's sake.

56:01.730 --> 56:03.668
Your mother's been
working for fucking days

56:03.701 --> 56:04.703
making this meal.

56:04.736 --> 56:05.671
Have some respect.

56:05.705 --> 56:06.874
There's other people
on this fucking table.

56:06.907 --> 56:08.845
-Mike, stop!
-Shut the fuck up!

56:08.878 --> 56:10.514
Throw the fuckin' fork!

56:12.451 --> 56:13.988
-Here you go.
-CARMY: Sit down. Sit down!

56:14.021 --> 56:15.692
MIKEY:
Oh, would you look at that?

56:15.725 --> 56:17.863
I didn't throw it.
I didn't throw it,
you fuckin' pussy!

56:17.896 --> 56:19.465
You fuckin' flinched! Look!

56:19.767 --> 56:21.737
You did it again,
you fuckin' pussy!

56:21.770 --> 56:23.708
Throw it.

56:23.741 --> 56:25.611
I'm not on anything.
I flinch.

56:26.412 --> 56:29.152
I still-- my brain's
connected to my nerves.

56:29.185 --> 56:30.154
You monster.

56:30.187 --> 56:31.590
MIKEY:
Yeah, I'm a monster, Lee.

56:31.623 --> 56:32.793
You're a fuckin' monster.

56:32.826 --> 56:33.661
-Nobody wants you here.
-LEE: You loser.

56:33.695 --> 56:35.130
MIKEY: Nobody
fucking wants you here.

56:35.163 --> 56:36.132
LEE:
You loser fuckin' monster.

56:36.165 --> 56:37.168
Nobody fuckin' wants you here

56:37.201 --> 56:39.105
with your big fuckin' mouth.

56:39.138 --> 56:40.842
With your big fuckin' mouth!

56:40.875 --> 56:42.579
-LEE: Fuckin' throw it.
-MIKEY: Yeah?

56:42.612 --> 56:44.482
Go ahead, fuckin' throw it,
you fucking animal.

56:44.516 --> 56:46.152
(braying) Yeah?

56:46.185 --> 56:48.791
Yeah. Make it about you.
Make Christmas about you.

56:48.824 --> 56:49.994
-(screeching)
-If you're such a tough guy,

56:50.027 --> 56:51.463
throw the fucking fork.

56:51.497 --> 56:52.732
You're nothing.

56:54.536 --> 56:56.072
You're nothing.

56:56.105 --> 56:57.474
You're nothing.

56:58.076 --> 56:59.478
You are nothing.

57:00.180 --> 57:01.482
You're nothing.

57:03.687 --> 57:04.856
You are nothing.

57:07.896 --> 57:08.998
You're nothing.

57:16.580 --> 57:18.149
-CICERO: Oh, there she is.
-(clapping)

57:19.285 --> 57:22.659
-Merry Christmas.
-RICHIE: Merry Christmas,
Auntie Dee.

57:22.692 --> 57:24.062
DONNA: What did I miss?

57:24.095 --> 57:26.801
(Donna laughing)

57:26.834 --> 57:29.807
-What'd I miss?
-LEE: Nothing.

57:29.840 --> 57:31.109
-I missed something.
-MIKEY: No, no, no.

57:31.142 --> 57:32.679
-CICERO: Come on.
-DONNA: Oh, thank you.

57:32.712 --> 57:34.215
Uh, Stevie, Stevie's
about to say grace, Ma.

57:34.248 --> 57:35.384
-DONNA: Ooh, good, yes.
-No.

57:35.417 --> 57:37.522
-MIKEY: Go ahead
and take it away there, Stevie.
-No.

57:37.555 --> 57:38.456
-Yes, yes, yes.
-STEVEN: Uh, I don't...

57:38.489 --> 57:39.860
MIKEY: Just fuckin'
say the thing, okay?

57:39.893 --> 57:41.196
MICHELLE:
Come on. You can do it.

57:41.229 --> 57:42.933
-STEVEN: Um...
-DONNA: Grace.

57:42.966 --> 57:44.001
Um...

57:45.070 --> 57:46.072
Hey. Uh...

57:46.841 --> 57:50.214
-It's great that we're all...
-I'm sorry.

57:50.247 --> 57:54.488
...that we're all together,
um, and healthy, I think.

57:55.190 --> 57:59.566
Uh, no one's si...
physically very sick.

57:59.599 --> 58:00.534
Uh...

58:02.171 --> 58:06.546
I'm so grateful, um,
for this beautiful meal.

58:07.281 --> 58:09.953
And, Donna, um...

58:09.986 --> 58:11.824
What an incredible job
Donna did.

58:11.857 --> 58:13.861
And I-I could,
I could hear in there.

58:13.894 --> 58:17.969
It sounded very hard
and it's just gorgeous.

58:18.002 --> 58:19.840
And is he still
holding the fork?

58:19.873 --> 58:20.975
-Sure is.
-MICHELLE: Yeah.

58:21.008 --> 58:23.013
STEVEN: Okay. Um...

58:23.046 --> 58:24.214
Listen.

58:25.785 --> 58:27.989
Everyone's asking what this...

58:28.022 --> 58:30.127
What is the seven fishes
or why do we do it?

58:30.160 --> 58:33.232
-MICHELLE: Mm-hmm.
-And I think I know
what my definition is.

58:33.734 --> 58:35.871
Uh, as soon as I think of it.

58:37.274 --> 58:39.579
It's a chance to...

58:40.380 --> 58:44.221
be together and to
take care of each other.

58:45.625 --> 58:47.260
And to eat together.

58:47.729 --> 58:50.167
And there's seven fishes,

58:50.200 --> 58:54.610
which means you have to make
seven entirely different dishes.

58:54.643 --> 58:56.914
Seven entirely different ways.

58:56.947 --> 58:59.686
And that takes a lot of time.

59:00.621 --> 59:01.556
And...

59:02.525 --> 59:06.065
I think spending that time
and using that time

59:06.098 --> 59:09.640
on the people that we love
is how we show them

59:09.673 --> 59:10.741
that we love them.

59:13.313 --> 59:14.849
And maybe we eat too much...

59:15.450 --> 59:17.789
and we definitely drink too much

59:17.822 --> 59:21.596
and we say too much
without listening.

59:21.997 --> 59:26.039
But... tonight we...
we're gonna eat
seven fishes...

59:26.072 --> 59:27.174
(Michelle laughs)

59:27.207 --> 59:28.310
...which is absurd.

59:28.343 --> 59:29.612
Uh...

59:30.080 --> 59:31.750
But we have to take
extra time to do it

59:32.117 --> 59:36.158
and we have to chew more
and we have to listen more.

59:38.229 --> 59:42.270
And, uh, we only get to do
this tonight one time.

59:43.674 --> 59:44.308
So...

59:45.243 --> 59:46.613
I, by the way, love it.

59:47.347 --> 59:49.084
I love being here.

59:49.485 --> 59:52.324
Thank you for having me
every year at this.

59:52.357 --> 59:55.029
I look... I very much
look forward to this.

59:56.065 --> 59:57.168
And I love you.

59:57.201 --> 01:00:00.140
I-I-I'm very in love
with Michelle.

01:00:00.575 --> 01:00:02.778
And I'm not gay
like you guys asked a lot.

01:00:03.279 --> 01:00:04.816
But I was
thinking about what...

01:00:05.284 --> 01:00:08.924
what you said about bears
and how they're aggressive.

01:00:10.260 --> 01:00:12.832
They're aggressive,
but they're kind.

01:00:13.867 --> 01:00:14.903
They're sensitive.

01:00:16.907 --> 01:00:19.713
You guys
have been so kind to me.

01:00:19.746 --> 01:00:21.216
You let me hang out
with you every holiday.

01:00:21.249 --> 01:00:23.820
I don't have a family
like this and...

01:00:24.990 --> 01:00:27.127
I'm really grateful that, um,

01:00:27.495 --> 01:00:29.097
you make space for me
at this table

01:00:29.666 --> 01:00:31.837
and you make time for me
on the holidays.

01:00:36.914 --> 01:00:40.153
May God bless us
and keep us safe
in the New Year.

01:00:40.186 --> 01:00:41.724
And please give
Michael the strength

01:00:41.757 --> 01:00:43.159
not to throw that fork.
Amen.

01:00:43.192 --> 01:00:44.997
-(laughter)
-ALL: Amen.

01:00:45.030 --> 01:00:46.232
-I love you.
-I love you.

01:00:48.771 --> 01:00:49.706
(Donna grunts)

01:00:49.740 --> 01:00:51.977
Stevie, that was, uh,
that was beautiful.

01:00:53.146 --> 01:00:54.682
-(whispers) That helps a little.
-Yeah.

01:00:55.317 --> 01:00:56.686
(sniffles)

01:00:57.454 --> 01:00:58.791
(sighs)

01:00:58.824 --> 01:01:00.126
Yeah. Yeah.

01:01:02.397 --> 01:01:04.101
It doesn't fuckin' matter.

01:01:04.134 --> 01:01:05.103
Oh, Donna.

01:01:05.136 --> 01:01:07.408
DONNA:
(softly) It doesn't...

01:01:07.441 --> 01:01:10.180
SUGAR:
Ma, come on.
It's so beautiful.

01:01:10.213 --> 01:01:11.282
So gorgeous.

01:01:11.315 --> 01:01:12.852
RICHIE:
Thanks, Auntie D.

01:01:12.885 --> 01:01:14.188
We love you so much.

01:01:14.221 --> 01:01:16.158
-We love you.
-CICERO: Gorgeous, D.

01:01:18.797 --> 01:01:20.300
-(sighs deeply)
-STEVEN: We can't wait.

01:01:20.333 --> 01:01:21.970
Mom. Mom. Hey.

01:01:23.172 --> 01:01:24.308
(exhales)

01:01:26.245 --> 01:01:27.280
You okay?

01:01:28.216 --> 01:01:29.485
MICHELLE: Oh, my God.

01:01:29.519 --> 01:01:31.890
(Donna sighs)

01:01:31.923 --> 01:01:33.426
Oh, Natalie...

01:01:34.529 --> 01:01:36.131
Rose Berzatto...

01:01:37.802 --> 01:01:39.940
do you know how much
I fucking hate

01:01:39.973 --> 01:01:41.877
-when you ask me that?
-Okay.

01:01:41.910 --> 01:01:47.488
Do you know
how much I fucking hate...

01:01:47.522 --> 01:01:49.091
-SUGAR: Let's go upstairs.
-...that you ask me that.

01:01:49.124 --> 01:01:50.327
SUGAR: Okay.

01:01:50.360 --> 01:01:52.331
Do you...
do you ask the rest

01:01:52.364 --> 01:01:55.103
of these people if they're okay?

01:01:55.136 --> 01:01:56.306
SUGAR: No.

01:01:56.339 --> 01:01:57.440
Uh...

01:01:57.909 --> 01:01:59.478
Do I not look okay, Natalie?

01:01:59.512 --> 01:02:00.914
Not really.

01:02:02.518 --> 01:02:03.954
SUGAR: Let's go upstairs.

01:02:03.987 --> 01:02:06.092
-Oh, fuck you, Michelle.
-CARMY: Hey, hey, hey.

01:02:06.125 --> 01:02:07.529
-I didn't mean it like--
-DONNA: I do not look okay?

01:02:07.562 --> 01:02:10.033
-I didn't mean it like--
-Did I not just bust my ass

01:02:10.668 --> 01:02:13.073
all day for you motherfuckers?

01:02:13.106 --> 01:02:14.408
I didn't mean it like that.

01:02:15.077 --> 01:02:19.218
-This... is beautiful.
-MICHELLE: It is.

01:02:19.251 --> 01:02:21.222
Am I okay?

01:02:21.255 --> 01:02:23.059
Am I okay?

01:02:23.628 --> 01:02:26.933
(screaming)
Are you motherfuckers okay?

01:02:27.869 --> 01:02:29.338
Are you okay, Lee?

01:02:30.875 --> 01:02:32.812
You didn't do shit!

01:02:35.250 --> 01:02:38.824
This is fucking gorgeous.

01:02:42.130 --> 01:02:44.368
Fuck you!

01:02:46.138 --> 01:02:47.240
Fuck you!

01:02:48.977 --> 01:02:50.079
Fuck you.

01:02:52.384 --> 01:02:54.822
-(crying) Fuck you, Natalie.
-(footsteps receding)

01:02:58.129 --> 01:02:59.265
MICHELLE (softly):
It's okay.

01:02:59.298 --> 01:03:00.801
-(door shuts)
-It's okay.

01:03:14.194 --> 01:03:16.867
(exhales)
Well, I guess we all knew
that was gonna happen.

01:03:16.900 --> 01:03:18.269
So it's out.

01:03:18.302 --> 01:03:21.241
And, uh, maybe everybody,
everybody can relax, huh?

01:03:22.912 --> 01:03:25.050
MICHELLE:
Yeah, that's, uh...

01:03:25.083 --> 01:03:26.820
That's the worst
I've ever seen her.

01:03:29.592 --> 01:03:31.462
You fuckin' piece of shit!

01:03:31.496 --> 01:03:34.167

01:03:35.236 --> 01:03:37.174
(screaming)

01:03:37.207 --> 01:03:38.343
Get the fuck out.

01:03:38.376 --> 01:03:39.613
(screaming continues)

01:03:39.646 --> 01:03:40.882
Get outta here.

01:03:40.915 --> 01:03:42.619
-(screaming continues)
-Hang on!

01:03:42.652 --> 01:03:44.088
(screaming continues)

01:03:44.121 --> 01:03:46.191

01:03:54.074 --> 01:03:55.578
MIKEY:
Ma, what did you do?

01:03:55.611 --> 01:03:57.214

01:03:57.247 --> 01:03:58.884
