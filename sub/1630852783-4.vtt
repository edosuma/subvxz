02:40.000 --> 02:41.879
Is that the only pudding they got?

02:41.880 --> 02:44.279
They've got pudding,
but you have to start with starters

02:44.280 --> 02:46.479
cos that's why it's called starter.
Right, got it.

02:46.480 --> 02:48.680
Right, so, tomato and basil? No.

02:50.880 --> 02:55.239
And then you've got risotto
or beef bourguignon.

02:55.240 --> 02:57.839
And it is New York cheesecake
for pudding.

02:57.840 --> 03:00.519
Ooh! BECKY CHUCKLES

03:00.520 --> 03:03.319
I think the beef. Righto.

03:03.320 --> 03:07.360

03:42.880 --> 03:45.280
I'd better enjoy it
before I'm out on the street.

03:49.080 --> 03:50.600
Oh, come on!

03:51.720 --> 03:54.040

your strong point.

Hi, Becky. Hi, Christine.

04:38.480 --> 04:40.759
Everything OK? Yeah, all fine.

04:40.760 --> 04:43.919
I just thought I'd drop by and see
your mum now that she's settled in.

04:43.920 --> 04:45.959
It's all right,
they've got great people here.

04:45.960 --> 04:48.920
Oh, I know, I know. It's no trouble.

04:50.240 --> 04:53.680

yeah? Sure.

PAM CHUCKLES

05:06.040 --> 05:07.759
Aw!

05:07.760 --> 05:09.960
I'll put the kettle on. Oh! Hm-hm.

05:13.640 --> 05:16.199
I just saw your Becky
in the corridor.

05:16.200 --> 05:19.119
Yeah. She couldn't get out of here
quick enough. Aw!

05:19.120 --> 05:21.960
She's always with her fancy man now.
That's a shame.

05:23.240 --> 05:24.879
Well, it won't last long.

05:24.880 --> 05:27.079
She can never hold anything down,
that one.

05:27.080 --> 05:28.359
Hm-hm!

05:28.360 --> 05:31.320
Oh, you have bought a lot,
haven't you?

05:35.280 --> 05:36.520
Hm!

05:48.680 --> 05:50.720
Hi, there. Hi. Everything OK?

05:51.920 --> 05:56.079
Yes. Um…I'm Sasha,
I'm Pam Greene's daughter.

05:56.080 --> 05:58.599
The woman visiting my mum just now,

05:58.600 --> 06:01.519
I've asked her not to come
because she upsets Mum every time,

06:01.520 --> 06:04.039
but she won't listen,
she just keeps showing up.

06:04.040 --> 06:05.479
I'm so sorry.

06:05.480 --> 06:08.239
Do you think you could make sure
she isn't allowed in to visit her?

06:08.240 --> 06:09.680
Completely understand.

06:11.080 --> 06:12.680
Of course. Of course.

06:30.240 --> 06:31.919
Yes, can I help you?

06:31.920 --> 06:34.220
BECKY LAUGHS
No, no, you have to do that again.

06:39.080 --> 06:41.079

Please, come in.

07:01.520 --> 07:02.960
What did you call me?

07:04.400 --> 07:06.040
I called you an idiot.

07:07.440 --> 07:08.960
I'm just excited.

07:21.800 --> 07:23.280
How are you feeling?

07:25.080 --> 07:26.360
Lighter.

07:27.840 --> 07:29.240
Good.

07:31.560 --> 07:32.880
Oh, Christ!

07:34.760 --> 07:36.559
What have you got in here?

07:36.560 --> 07:38.480
Mum. ELLIOT CHUCKLES

07:41.000 --> 07:43.400
I've cleared some space
in the cupboards for you.

07:46.760 --> 07:48.360
I'm not moving in.

07:49.640 --> 07:51.719
I know, I know.

07:51.720 --> 07:54.770
It's just until you find somewhere
else to stay, right? Right.

07:57.560 --> 07:58.999
Want some coffee?

07:59.000 --> 08:01.120
Yes, please. OK.

08:48.920 --> 08:51.519
Well, I'm on your website now
looking at a photo of my daughter

08:51.520 --> 08:54.279
that you just love to flash around
to show how inclusive you are.

08:54.280 --> 08:58.039
And I have to say, that word
feels very hollow to me right now.

08:58.040 --> 08:59.920
My son is atypical!

09:02.240 --> 09:04.440
Oh, come on,
it was just a little bite.

09:05.720 --> 09:07.080
How…how much blood?

09:09.280 --> 09:10.519

09:14.080 --> 09:16.560
Yep. What time?

09:19.360 --> 09:22.010
OK, thanks. No, please don't.
I'll just see you there.

09:23.520 --> 09:25.560
LIVIA SIGHS Oh, God!

09:29.800 --> 09:32.920
I have to go into Noah's school.
Trunchbull's not happy.

09:34.240 --> 09:37.799
I think we're going to have to find him
another school. He's just not managing.

09:37.800 --> 09:41.479
I'm sorry to dump this on you, but can you
handle the last bits and pieces for Phil's show?

09:41.480 --> 09:43.360
No, no, no, it's fine. Thank you.

09:47.600 --> 09:51.159
Liv? Yeah? Sorry to be a pain. Um…

09:51.160 --> 09:53.359
But have you had a chance to pay
my invoice yet?

09:53.360 --> 09:56.479
Oh, God, I'm so sorry!
No, no, please, it's…it's just

09:56.480 --> 10:00.039
with my mum's home
and trying to find a new place…

10:00.040 --> 10:03.359
Of course. Um…there's, er…been
a bit of a cash flow problem

10:03.360 --> 10:06.559
and backlog, but I will…I will
do it as soon as I can.

10:06.560 --> 10:08.120
I'm sorry. Thank you.

10:09.440 --> 10:10.919
I've got to go. Hm!

10:10.920 --> 10:14.119
Got to go and face the mums

10:14.120 --> 10:18.439
before Noah cannibalises
another one of the little shits.

10:18.440 --> 10:19.799
BECKY CHUCKLES

10:19.800 --> 10:22.879

the caterers' list?

10:22.880 --> 10:25.079
Oh! Yes, of course. Yes, yes.

10:25.080 --> 10:27.759

confirmed for the exhibition.

Aha!

11:43.880 --> 11:45.839
How are you? I'm fine.

11:45.840 --> 11:48.079
So, about Phil's exhibition,

11:48.080 --> 11:50.039
thank you so much for sorting out
the space.

11:50.040 --> 11:51.999
Um…I can show you…

11:52.000 --> 11:55.550
Right, right, right, so, that's how
we're going to be doing this, is it?

11:56.640 --> 11:58.800
Sorry, I've been busy.

11:59.800 --> 12:01.120
Huh. Um…

12:03.440 --> 12:05.890

for Livia. Yes.

12:07.960 --> 12:09.640
So, you're seeing him again?

12:10.640 --> 12:12.360
Does he know your real name yet?

12:14.120 --> 12:16.079

DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES

13:22.120 --> 13:26.600
What have I told you
about getting drunk without me? Hm?

13:28.440 --> 13:30.720
Well, catch up, then! If I must.

13:39.040 --> 13:43.360
God, my whole day has felt like
one long meeting.

INCOMING CALL

13:52.600 --> 13:54.440
Everything all right? Yeah. Um…

13:56.600 --> 14:01.279
Yeah. Liv has just been putting off
paying my invoice for a while.

14:01.280 --> 14:04.559
I'm just trying to work out
what to say.

14:04.560 --> 14:07.360
What do you mean -
she's not paying you?

14:08.360 --> 14:10.399
There's…there's a cash flow issue.

14:10.400 --> 14:12.600
Which, of course,
I completely understand.

14:14.680 --> 14:16.720
That is such typical Livia.

14:18.080 --> 14:19.559
Do you want me to have a word?

14:19.560 --> 14:21.880
No, I-I don't want to make it
a thing.

14:23.000 --> 14:26.480
Well, you can be running a political
campaign and not pay your staff.

14:27.880 --> 14:29.120
No.

14:30.400 --> 14:32.480
I'll cover you for now. No!

14:34.640 --> 14:35.960
Honestly, it's nothing.

14:37.600 --> 14:39.080
Put your details in there.

14:44.520 --> 14:47.480
I…I will pay you back.

14:48.960 --> 14:50.560
And the money I owe you for Mum.

14:51.720 --> 14:54.719
Sure. There's, er…no rush.

14:54.720 --> 14:58.120
And I'll have a word in the
meantime, hurry things up a bit.

15:00.200 --> 15:01.879
Thank you.

15:01.880 --> 15:03.360
All done.

15:05.960 --> 15:07.760
Now, can we get drunk?

15:09.280 --> 15:11.120
Please? Ha-ha!

15:59.000 --> 16:01.040
What? It's nothing.

16:02.280 --> 16:04.160
Silly as this, um…

16:05.200 --> 16:06.560
The curtains…

16:08.000 --> 16:09.720
…we always used to have them open.

16:11.240 --> 16:14.119
She…said that she liked it,

16:14.120 --> 16:17.000
to be able to see outside.

16:19.800 --> 16:22.399
OK. Well, um…let's…let's open…

16:22.400 --> 16:25.080
Wait, no!
No, you're misunderstanding me. I…

16:26.560 --> 16:28.039
…I like them closed.

16:28.040 --> 16:30.960
It's just when you went to
close them, I…

16:32.120 --> 16:34.200
…I thought about looking over
my shoulder…

16:35.640 --> 16:37.440
…in case she was there…

16:38.480 --> 16:40.240
…watching.

16:43.320 --> 16:44.640
Look, is this…

16:46.160 --> 16:49.400
…too much…me coming to stay?

16:52.960 --> 16:54.280
No.

16:56.520 --> 16:57.920
I'm sorry.

17:00.240 --> 17:01.800
I want you here.

17:37.680 --> 17:39.120
SHE GASPS

17:40.720 --> 17:42.480
SHE PANTS

17:46.400 --> 17:48.719
SHE EXHALES

17:48.720 --> 17:50.240
FAINT CHATTER

17:58.040 --> 17:59.639
We're going straight out, aren't we?

17:59.640 --> 18:01.159
Elliot will drive us.

18:01.160 --> 18:03.199
But my car's in front of his.

18:03.200 --> 18:04.919
Why don't you two go on ahead?

18:04.920 --> 18:08.480
No! We are absolutely
going together. Go on, now!

18:16.120 --> 18:17.720
Hello.

18:18.640 --> 18:21.719
Ahem! Tiggy, er…this is Sasha.

18:21.720 --> 18:23.280
I think you've met before.

18:24.320 --> 18:26.159
I don't remember.

18:26.160 --> 18:30.439
And, er…this is Blob…er…B,
my, um…little sister.

18:30.440 --> 18:33.359
I couldn't say her name
when we were little, so…

18:33.360 --> 18:35.599
Blobs it was. Lucky me.

18:35.600 --> 18:37.520
B AND BECKY GIGGLE

18:39.680 --> 18:41.799
Oh, and what about Sasha?

18:41.800 --> 18:44.479
I'm sure she's not coming
to lay the headstone

18:44.480 --> 18:48.359
on your dead wife's grave
in her kimono.

18:48.360 --> 18:50.559
This is a very difficult day for me.

18:50.560 --> 18:52.799
She was like the daughter
that I never had.

18:52.800 --> 18:54.239
Mum!

18:54.240 --> 18:56.559
Oh, don't be so sensitive,
you know exactly what I mean!

18:56.560 --> 18:59.319
I-I didn't know it was today. Sorry.

18:59.320 --> 19:01.359
It's fine. I did say yesterday

19:01.360 --> 19:03.610
we'd be at the graveyard
all morning, but, er…

19:04.400 --> 19:05.920
I need to get my car key.

19:08.400 --> 19:10.080
I'm going to wait outside.

19:20.280 --> 19:23.480
Sorry about Mum. Don't take it
personally, she's just the worst.

19:24.640 --> 19:26.320
I just had mine put in a home.

19:27.480 --> 19:29.959
THEY LAUGH I really have.

19:29.960 --> 19:32.640
B, move this wretched car now!

19:36.600 --> 19:39.199
You two aren't going to gang up
on me, are you?

19:39.200 --> 19:40.480
Don't be silly.

19:42.040 --> 19:43.720
See you at lunchtime. OK.

19:51.240 --> 19:53.600
DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES

19:54.760 --> 19:57.599
PODCAST: …Avert the huge
catastrophes that have been predicted?

19:57.600 --> 20:00.279
Well, not on their own.

20:00.280 --> 20:03.679
But actually, I look at the future
and I feel huge hope.

20:03.680 --> 20:06.679
I always think the best of people.

20:06.680 --> 20:08.719
I think everyone wants to do
the right thing,

20:08.720 --> 20:10.519
and, yes, I may be an optimist,

20:10.520 --> 20:13.999
but I truly believe that having
faith in people is important,

20:14.000 --> 20:17.519
because it's what we base
meaningful action on.

20:17.520 --> 20:19.279
So, for example,

20:19.280 --> 20:22.079
I've been working with some
social enterprise companies

20:22.080 --> 20:25.520
that are developing a number
of incredible technologies that…

20:31.680 --> 20:33.199
BANGING

20:33.200 --> 20:34.760
SHE EXHALES SOFTLY

21:03.840 --> 21:05.240
DISTANT THUD

21:11.480 --> 21:13.080
THUD!

21:17.360 --> 21:18.960
BANG!

21:21.280 --> 21:22.760
BANG!

21:27.200 --> 21:28.800
BANG!

21:30.120 --> 21:31.360
BANG!

21:33.520 --> 21:34.960
BANG!

23:49.320 --> 23:50.800
Hey.

23:52.920 --> 23:54.320
Hi.

23:58.400 --> 24:00.320
Sorry, about earlier.

24:01.320 --> 24:02.960
Your mum. HE SIGHS

24:04.440 --> 24:06.840
I don't think she's a fan of me.
SHE CHUCKLES

24:08.960 --> 24:12.160
I don't think she's been a fan
of anyone since 1992.

24:16.080 --> 24:19.080
But fucking hell, I wish she'd
let me live my life, you know?

24:20.600 --> 24:23.200
Let's forget about her. Let's.

24:28.040 --> 24:29.360
How was it?

24:31.000 --> 24:32.320
HE SIGHS

24:33.760 --> 24:35.640
Seeing her headstone…

24:38.560 --> 24:40.200
…her grave…

24:43.440 --> 24:46.559
…the fact that she's under there,

24:46.560 --> 24:47.960
in the ground…

24:49.200 --> 24:50.600
Sorry. Er…

24:53.240 --> 24:54.640
Sorry. Er…

24:56.840 --> 25:00.680
I think me being here,
it's…it's…too much.

25:01.680 --> 25:03.040
You don't understand.

25:05.360 --> 25:07.359
The whole time I was there,
all I wanted to do

25:07.360 --> 25:09.280
was to come back here to you.

25:10.320 --> 25:12.599
And then I kept…I kept thinking,

25:12.600 --> 25:17.160
things can just be taken from you
without warning.

25:18.640 --> 25:21.479
Well, then, all the more reason
to make the most

25:21.480 --> 25:23.760
of any happiness you can find,
right?

25:26.800 --> 25:30.400
Maybe you don't need to look
elsewhere for somewhere to stay.

25:37.880 --> 25:39.400
Um…

25:42.000 --> 25:43.599
But he'd have to tell Liv.

25:43.600 --> 25:45.080
HE LAUGHS

25:47.080 --> 25:49.480
Yeah, yeah,
I suppose we would at some point.

25:50.720 --> 25:52.080
When?

25:53.680 --> 25:55.919
Tomorrow? At the exhibition?

25:55.920 --> 25:58.360
Well, she'll be in a good mood.

26:01.840 --> 26:03.160
OK.

26:04.480 --> 26:06.079
OK.

26:06.080 --> 26:07.760

26:09.480 --> 26:11.320

29:14.600 --> 29:16.399

29:16.400 --> 29:18.239
Hello. About tonight…

29:18.240 --> 29:19.599
…er…

29:19.600 --> 29:21.600
Do you want to speak to Livia
or shall I?

29:22.800 --> 29:24.639
Er…

29:24.640 --> 29:26.040
I think I should.

29:27.800 --> 29:29.520
Yeah, I think so, too.

29:33.000 --> 29:34.999
Are you sure? Mm-hm.

29:35.000 --> 29:36.280
OK.

29:39.160 --> 29:40.520
Hair up or down?

29:42.320 --> 29:43.760
I like it down.

30:26.760 --> 30:29.719
Yeah, I'm thinking we change
playlists around…nine?

30:29.720 --> 30:31.959
Just wait till it gets
a bit more crowded.

30:31.960 --> 30:33.999
And we'll get started in about
half an hour?

30:34.000 --> 30:35.280
Sure. Cool.

30:37.160 --> 30:39.599
What do you want me to do about it?
I don't know, I just feel…

30:39.600 --> 30:41.559
Is this the most recent update?

30:41.560 --> 30:42.719
What are you worried about?

30:42.720 --> 30:45.159
I don't know, it's just a lot of
the big dicks haven't RSVP'd.

30:45.160 --> 30:47.999
The what? You know, big dicks.
Money to burn on shit art.

30:48.000 --> 30:50.959
Wow, insulting as well as sexist.

30:50.960 --> 30:52.639
Some of the big dicks
are women, Phil.

30:52.640 --> 30:55.119
Look, don't worry. There's a lot of
tech guys on there

30:55.120 --> 30:57.479
from Elliot who apparently love
to show off to each other.

30:57.480 --> 30:59.319
I'm sure they'll be fighting
over your work.

30:59.320 --> 31:01.239
Oh, well, I don't know about that.

31:01.240 --> 31:04.359
Oh, the final room is finished. Oh.

31:04.360 --> 31:05.839
Want to come and have a look? Yeah.

31:05.840 --> 31:07.199
Has Elliot seen it?

31:07.200 --> 31:09.239
No.

31:09.240 --> 31:11.690
I think we should both be there
if we can as well.

31:31.160 --> 31:32.480
Gosh, it's a lot.

31:58.320 --> 31:59.680
It's beautiful.

32:01.600 --> 32:03.040
I mean, I have warned him.

32:11.600 --> 32:12.960
Shall we?

33:08.800 --> 33:10.240
That's my favourite.

33:20.920 --> 33:22.240
You smashed it.

33:23.840 --> 33:26.360
She is eating out of the palm
of his hand.

33:27.840 --> 33:30.439
Rich women love artists.

33:30.440 --> 33:33.039
Honestly, the amount of them willing
to take their clothes off,

33:33.040 --> 33:34.999
lie on a stained mattress and
tell my husband

33:35.000 --> 33:37.599
all their secrets is unbelievable.

33:37.600 --> 33:38.959
Really? Yeah.

33:38.960 --> 33:40.399
Yeah, he's like a Catholic priest.

33:40.400 --> 33:42.119
He knows everything about everyone.

33:42.120 --> 33:44.559
And the most annoying thing?

33:44.560 --> 33:46.879
He's completely trustworthy.
He never tells.

33:46.880 --> 33:48.159
I could murder him.

33:48.160 --> 33:50.399
He looks so happy, though. Yeah.

33:50.400 --> 33:51.999
Like a pig in shit.

33:52.000 --> 33:53.999
Sasha!

33:54.000 --> 33:55.679
What a treat! Hi.

33:55.680 --> 33:57.639
Hello, my love. Hello.

33:57.640 --> 33:59.559
Thank you so much for coming!

33:59.560 --> 34:00.920
No, I had to come.

34:02.080 --> 34:04.040
Well done, you. Aren't you clever?

34:05.200 --> 34:08.239
And you have so much trust in her!

34:08.240 --> 34:09.560
It's wonderful.

34:10.600 --> 34:12.840
Well, you've certainly made
an impression.

34:14.760 --> 34:18.040
Ooh, look which cowboy just
rode into town.

34:19.320 --> 34:21.999
Seems like he's got a new horse.

34:22.000 --> 34:24.040
Good for him. Yeah.

34:25.880 --> 34:28.200
Liv, I…
I should go and say thank you.

34:43.840 --> 34:45.199
Hey. Hi, Sasha.

34:45.200 --> 34:47.039
Excuse me, Mr Fairbourne,
can I take a photo?

34:47.040 --> 34:48.320
Oh, sure.

34:49.680 --> 34:51.799
Thank you.
Sasha, you remember Jack?

34:51.800 --> 34:53.279
Richard's father. I do.

34:53.280 --> 34:55.759
Sasha's the creative brains
behind the whole event.

34:55.760 --> 34:58.519
We were just saying the curation
is inspired.

34:58.520 --> 35:02.759
Oh, well, Phil had a strong vision.
I just made it happen.

35:02.760 --> 35:04.799
Well, congratulations.

35:04.800 --> 35:06.919
Have you seen the Chloe room yet,
Elliot?

35:06.920 --> 35:08.919
Er, I-I've been waiting to…

35:08.920 --> 35:11.220
I'm going to leave you.
It's incredibly moving.

35:12.360 --> 35:13.760
I'm sure it is.

INDISTINCT SPEECH

35:37.200 --> 35:38.480

35:41.320 --> 35:43.280
I'm still trying to work
out what it is.

35:45.040 --> 35:46.360
We're OK, by the way.

35:47.920 --> 35:49.320
I'll be fine.

35:51.040 --> 35:52.480
Sorry.

35:54.680 --> 35:56.160
Take care of yourself.

36:02.680 --> 36:04.040
There you are.

36:05.720 --> 36:07.040
Bye, Becky Green.

36:45.280 --> 36:47.040
SHE SIGHS

36:48.320 --> 36:50.560
She was so beautiful.

36:54.760 --> 36:56.440
I wish you could have met her.

36:58.000 --> 36:59.400
Me, too.

37:01.000 --> 37:02.720
She was so perceptive.

37:06.000 --> 37:08.760
I'd love to know what she would have
thought of you.

37:38.400 --> 37:40.319
Hey, how are you doing?

37:40.320 --> 37:42.199
I'm OK. Head rush.

37:42.200 --> 37:43.799
Oh, well, drink this.

LIVIA SIGHS

37:48.760 --> 37:51.999
You know, some women would be
threatened by their husband

37:52.000 --> 37:55.040
devoting an entire gallery
to their best friend.

37:57.920 --> 37:59.240
Phil?

38:00.520 --> 38:01.800
He loves you.

38:02.800 --> 38:05.599
Just as much as he loves
going to the cinema.

38:05.600 --> 38:08.480
He gets to sit there passively
while everything just…

38:11.360 --> 38:13.759
Isn't that just what happens when
you've been with someone

38:13.760 --> 38:15.279
a long time?

38:15.280 --> 38:16.800
Not with Elliot and Chloe.

38:18.760 --> 38:20.280
She never knew what she had.

38:27.040 --> 38:28.440
Liv. Hm?

38:30.400 --> 38:32.360
There's something I've been
meaning…

38:33.720 --> 38:35.439
Meaning to tell you.

38:35.440 --> 38:38.159
I just haven't found
the right moment.

38:38.160 --> 38:40.439
What?

38:40.440 --> 38:42.040
Elliot.

38:43.600 --> 38:45.679
Um, we're…

38:45.680 --> 38:47.160
…seeing each other again.

38:49.320 --> 38:50.720
Um…

38:52.120 --> 38:54.280
I'm sorry, I should have told you
earlier.

39:00.080 --> 39:01.880
Liv? Yeah, you should have.

39:11.000 --> 39:12.600
Hi. You all right? Yeah.

39:16.920 --> 39:18.360
It's amazing.

39:20.880 --> 39:23.440
I've got literally hundreds
of photos of her.

39:26.240 --> 39:29.320
But this is how I remember her.

39:31.480 --> 39:33.880
If I may, I'd love to… Oh, wow.

39:36.720 --> 39:39.199
There we go.

39:39.200 --> 39:41.119
Of course.

39:41.120 --> 39:42.600
That's where it belongs.

39:52.080 --> 39:53.440
It's…

39:56.240 --> 39:57.680
It's beautiful.

40:04.560 --> 40:07.239
We really don't know what was
going on, do we?

40:07.240 --> 40:08.999
No.

40:09.000 --> 40:10.799
Do you know what I can't get
out of my head?

40:10.800 --> 40:12.759
What?

40:12.760 --> 40:14.799
The Becky Green thing.

40:14.800 --> 40:16.479
Same. Same here.

40:16.480 --> 40:18.999
I mean, they weren't in touch,
were they?

40:19.000 --> 40:20.999
Why would Chloe be in touch
with Becky Green?

40:21.000 --> 40:22.999
Well, I don't know. It just doesn't
make sense.

40:23.000 --> 40:24.880
Chloe's last call, to Becky Green?

40:26.000 --> 40:27.679
Did you ever meet her? No.

40:27.680 --> 40:30.119
Chloe told me about her.
But didn't she go to your school?

40:30.120 --> 40:32.879
No, Chloe went to this really
depressing place for a bit

40:32.880 --> 40:34.439
when her dad went bankrupt.

40:34.440 --> 40:36.559
And this girl sort of latched on
like a limpet

40:36.560 --> 40:37.999
and wouldn't let go.

40:38.000 --> 40:41.279
Chloe had this thing for odd types.

40:41.280 --> 40:43.559
Yeah, she was a magnet for that
type of person.

40:43.560 --> 40:46.879
Poor girl. Chloe, she didn't know
how to say no.

40:46.880 --> 40:50.559
Yeah. Do you remember Chloe's 17th,
when she just showed up

40:50.560 --> 40:51.999
and lost her shit?

40:52.000 --> 40:53.719
Oh, God, yeah. She wouldn't leave.

40:53.720 --> 40:56.559
Do you remember Rich pissed in his
beer and threw it at her?

40:56.560 --> 40:57.799
Bloody hell, Rich.

40:57.800 --> 40:59.719
Wow, that's awful.

40:59.720 --> 41:01.239
I know.

41:01.240 --> 41:03.319
I feel bad.

41:03.320 --> 41:05.879
We didn't realise.
Maybe she wasn't well?

41:05.880 --> 41:07.599
Come on, you were young.

41:07.600 --> 41:09.399
What happened to her?
I don't know.

41:09.400 --> 41:10.959
I don't know.

41:10.960 --> 41:12.839
I don't know. I'm going
to Google her.

46:25.120 --> 46:28.399

46:28.400 --> 46:30.560
…he put her on a pedestal.

Why do you think she did it?

47:08.360 --> 47:10.720
…got up to go during the speech.

47:12.640 --> 47:16.200
Richard went to check on her,
I think Liv did the same.

47:19.560 --> 47:21.440
And I saw her before she left.

47:27.600 --> 47:29.320
She seemed scared.

47:37.040 --> 47:40.080
I suppose that's when she realised
what she was about to do.

47:42.400 --> 47:44.200
And it really hit her.

47:48.600 --> 47:50.600
I wish I'd gone after her.

47:59.440 --> 48:00.920
I'm sorry.

48:05.440 --> 48:07.240
I should go. Hm.

48:09.000 --> 48:11.199
Where's Liv?

48:11.200 --> 48:12.240
Oh, um…

48:15.120 --> 48:17.160
…she left with a guy.

48:20.560 --> 48:22.080
What?

48:25.240 --> 48:26.839
Don't worry.

48:26.840 --> 48:28.440
Happens sometimes.

48:29.720 --> 48:31.360
But she always comes back.

48:33.000 --> 48:34.640
I had no idea.

48:37.560 --> 48:39.000
Why would you?

49:33.920 --> 49:36.040
ENGINE STARTS

49:55.760 --> 49:57.800
Hi, is it Stuart?

49:58.840 --> 50:02.359
Yeah. Um, Jerome said you might be
able to help me.

50:02.360 --> 50:05.319
Sorry, I'm Sally Griffiths,
I'm from the security company.

50:05.320 --> 50:08.119
It's about some historic
CCTV footage.

50:08.120 --> 50:11.159
Yeah? We had an urgent message
from the PCU.

50:11.160 --> 50:14.079
I was here earlier, but it was
pretty manic, and Jerome said

50:14.080 --> 50:16.639
to try you on the night shift
when it was a bit quieter.

50:16.640 --> 50:18.279
Well, he didn't say.

50:18.280 --> 50:20.599
Oh, God, he's so forgetful! Yeah!

50:20.600 --> 50:22.199
THEY CHUCKLE

50:22.200 --> 50:25.279
Um, it's April 11th, 7:25pm.

50:25.280 --> 50:27.359
It was a big charity do.

50:27.360 --> 50:30.359
Oh, yeah, he's supposed to delete
everything after 30 days, but…

50:30.360 --> 50:32.120
He forgets! Yeah!

50:34.480 --> 50:36.039
There we go.

50:36.040 --> 50:37.600
7:25pm.

51:11.880 --> 51:14.640
Can you, um, can you jump forward
a bit, please?

51:16.440 --> 51:19.520
Have you got another camera
in there? Yeah.

51:28.440 --> 51:30.360
Can you flip back?

51:32.760 --> 51:34.839
LIFT DINGS

51:34.840 --> 51:36.680
INDISTINCT CHATTER

51:39.680 --> 51:42.799
Um, have you got long left
on your shift?

51:42.800 --> 51:45.319
Yeah, I'm on till eight
in the morning.

51:45.320 --> 51:46.839
Mate! Oh!

51:46.840 --> 51:49.879
Well, um, I'll leave you alone
after this, you can catch a nap.

51:49.880 --> 51:52.240
Yeah. THEY CHUCKLE

51:54.920 --> 51:57.079
Can you flip… Sorry.

51:57.080 --> 51:58.600

52:44.400 --> 52:47.439
Right, no, that's great,
you're a star. Star, Stuart.

52:47.440 --> 52:50.319
Hi, Jerome. I'm just going to grab
my coat. Thank you.

52:50.320 --> 52:52.439

52:52.440 --> 52:54.600

53:08.560 --> 53:09.919

54:08.560 --> 54:10.119
I'm so sorry.

54:10.120 --> 54:12.519
I've been calling and calling.
Um…

54:12.520 --> 54:14.519
I, uh…

54:14.520 --> 54:17.559
I just saw her parents there
and I freaked out.

54:17.560 --> 54:20.119
All right, but where are you now?
Why didn't you pick up?

54:20.120 --> 54:22.359
Sorry. I, um…

54:22.360 --> 54:27.839
I just needed some space, I just
felt like a bit of an impostor.

54:27.840 --> 54:29.359
Um…

54:29.360 --> 54:32.079
HE SIGHS I'm coming home now.

54:32.080 --> 54:34.719
OK? HE SIGHS

54:34.720 --> 54:38.839
I had no idea where you were,
I just, I really panicked.

54:38.840 --> 54:42.319
I've already lost someone I love.
You know?

54:42.320 --> 54:43.720
No, I know.

54:45.200 --> 54:46.679
It's okay.

54:46.680 --> 54:48.839
I'm in the car, I'll be 20 minutes.

54:48.840 --> 54:50.360
Please don't do it again.

54:51.680 --> 54:53.799
Sorry. OK. Thank you.
