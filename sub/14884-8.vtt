<i>Like, I've set this boundary that</i>
<i>he just can't come here in this state.</i>

12:59.812 --> 13:00.813
<i>He said he was coming here,</i>

13:00.880 --> 13:02.181
<i>and it's been four days now, right?</i>

13:03.682 --> 13:07.119
<i>This is not one of those situations</i>
<i>where, "Oh, I got… up,</i>

13:07.186 --> 13:09.989
<i>and then I sobered up,</i>
<i>and I realized I got… up,</i>

13:10.055 --> 13:12.224
<i>and okay, I'm cool now for a week."</i>
<i>You know what I mean?</i>

13:12.291 --> 13:14.126
<i>He needs help, he needs help.</i>

13:29.308 --> 13:32.378
<i>The good news is that they are</i>
<i>gonna get a plane now,</i>

13:32.444 --> 13:34.146
<i>within the next hour,</i>
<i>and get him out of here.</i>

13:37.016 --> 13:38.284
<i>Okay, I'll call you.</i>

20:36.501 --> 20:38.837
Do you guys know what "freezing" is?

26:00.258 --> 26:01.726
<i>Do you have a second to talk?</i>

26:06.531 --> 26:12.604
<i>Well… I was talking to Khloé and Kim
the other day or whatever,</i>

26:12.671 --> 26:17.409
<i>and they were just telling me</i>
<i>all this stuff</i>

26:17.475 --> 26:19.644
<i>that's making me second-guess the house.</i>

26:21.680 --> 26:24.282
<i>And making me feel like</i>
<i>this is a really big deal.</i>

26:24.349 --> 26:26.017
<i>I don't know if I can handle it.</i>

26:42.267 --> 26:46.004
<i>So I was really excited,</i>
<i>but they're talking about money,</i>

26:46.071 --> 26:48.340
<i>all the work and all the stuff.</i>

27:03.521 --> 27:04.389
<i>Yeah.</i>

27:21.306 --> 27:22.207
<i>Yeah.</i>

30:10.742 --> 30:13.011
Whenever you guys are ready,
you guys can fire up.

30:43.741 --> 30:45.810
-It's got 20 horsepower.
-Take mine for a quick ride.

30:45.877 --> 30:48.780
I'll go with you. I don't mind. I don't
need to drive. I'll just hang with you.

30:52.684 --> 30:54.285
Are you having fun, babe?

41:34.124 --> 41:37.595
People were talking a lot about your lips.
Tell me about them.
