Did, um, did you bring an item of his?

01:28.881 --> 01:30.132
Yes, I did.

01:30.591 --> 01:33.927
His doll. I had it made to look like me.

01:34.344 --> 01:35.679
Whoa.

01:35.679 --> 01:37.639
You'll have to give me

-Yes!
-not worse.

There's a reason I go
to a psychic and not a therapist.

the truth doesn't always care

02:09.922 --> 02:10.923
about how we feel.

02:13.550 --> 02:15.344

04:11.293 --> 04:12.961
We're having a party!

04:12.961 --> 04:14.880
It's a housewarming. I hope that's okay.

- Of course!

04:42.991 --> 04:44.451
Can you see when people
are going to leave?

04:44.993 --> 04:46.912
- Oh no. Unfortunately,
I can't choose what I see.

04:46.912 --> 04:49.122
That's why I end up having
so many visions of old men

04:49.122 --> 04:50.415
shaving their shoulders.

04:50.415 --> 04:51.750
Yeah, it's a thing.

04:51.750 --> 04:54.545
- I hope that's not why you ran away
halfway through my reading.

04:54.545 --> 04:56.964
- You ran away during his reading?

04:56.964 --> 05:00.008
- No, I didn't run away.
I just saw all there was to see.

05:00.008 --> 05:02.928
- Oh, I bet you know
some things that I don't.

05:07.432 --> 05:09.476
Oh gosh.

05:10.102 --> 05:11.603

It's, uh, 4:15.

05:14.314 --> 05:15.858
Yes, stay, Dave made beer.

05:16.692 --> 05:18.360
And we also have good beer.

05:18.360 --> 05:21.738
- Oh, but we actually like
unregulated alcohol.

05:21.738 --> 05:23.031
Oh, do we?

05:23.031 --> 05:24.032
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

05:24.032 --> 05:25.033
Let's try it.

05:27.077 --> 05:29.037
You're acting a little weird.

05:29.037 --> 05:30.455
I'm sorry. I know.

05:30.455 --> 05:33.876
I can't be hanging around
with the guy that I slept with

05:33.876 --> 05:38.172
and his new old girlfriend
and her very angular clavicles.

05:39.047 --> 05:41.633
- You might end up loving her.
You've been wrong before.

05:41.633 --> 05:42.885
Remember when we were kids

05:42.885 --> 05:45.137
and you had that vision of me
driving a PT Cruiser

05:45.137 --> 05:47.431
and therefore predicted
that I would be a millionaire?

05:47.431 --> 05:49.266
It looked very fancy back then,

05:49.266 --> 05:50.601
and I had no context.

05:50.601 --> 05:51.643
And predictions aside,

05:51.643 --> 05:55.272
Jessie does not know about me and Ben,

05:55.272 --> 05:57.816
so the less time
I spend around her, the better.

05:57.816 --> 05:59.234
Hmm. Oh.

05:59.234 --> 06:00.569
- Hey!
- Hey.

06:00.569 --> 06:02.863
- You know,
Amy is coming over on Thursday.

06:02.863 --> 06:03.989
You guys should join.

06:03.989 --> 06:06.491
We can do a girls' night.
We can discuss that hair issue.

06:07.367 --> 06:09.536
- We'd love to.
- Amazing.

06:09.536 --> 06:11.872
Ooh, we can play a drinking game
where we say we're fine,

06:11.872 --> 06:13.332
but then drink until we admit we're not

06:13.332 --> 06:14.708
and spill all of our darkest secrets.

06:14.708 --> 06:16.376
Okay.

06:16.376 --> 06:18.587
Sometimes I go to IKEA for dinner.

06:18.587 --> 06:20.547
- I don't wear underwear
when I try on swimsuits.

06:20.547 --> 06:21.798
- Sometimes I let my dog--

06:21.798 --> 06:23.592
- Okay, guys, we haven't
started playing yet.

06:23.592 --> 06:26.094
- That's right. We got to save
this energy for Thursday.

06:26.470 --> 06:27.471
Can't wait.

06:30.474 --> 06:31.892
Why would you agree to that?

06:31.892 --> 06:33.977
I can't spill my darkest secrets to her.

06:33.977 --> 06:35.687
And you know how I get
when I Sancerre.

06:35.687 --> 06:37.564
But she does hair professionally.

06:37.564 --> 06:39.608
That's the most important friend
I can have next to someone

06:39.608 --> 06:40.984
who knows how to wax it off.

06:41.860 --> 06:44.571
Next to you, my numero uno.

06:47.407 --> 06:49.034
No, no.

06:49.034 --> 06:50.035

06:56.834 --> 06:59.419
Ooh. Is that Bulgarian rosewater?

06:59.419 --> 07:02.506
- Pine-Sol. I'm having an earwig problem.

07:02.506 --> 07:03.841
Oh, I have had a day.

07:03.841 --> 07:06.468
You wouldn't believe this lady
that was in here upset

07:06.468 --> 07:07.761
about her lost bird.

07:07.761 --> 07:10.264
What she should have been upset about
is her online shopping habit.

07:10.264 --> 07:12.808
- Wait. Margot came to you?
- Mm-hmm.

07:12.808 --> 07:15.727
- What is with everybody?
Nobody wants the truth anymore.

07:15.727 --> 07:18.188
Well, not the way you stab it into them.

07:18.188 --> 07:21.775
I just told her the bird ended up
on a singles nudist cruise.

07:22.359 --> 07:23.861
That's where I'd fly away to.

07:25.612 --> 07:27.364
- Angel.
- Sorry.

07:27.364 --> 07:29.449
- Yeah. Aren't we supposed
to be honest with people,

07:29.449 --> 07:30.534
even if it hurts them?

07:30.534 --> 07:31.577
Well, yeah,

07:31.577 --> 07:34.705
but maybe you can start
by being honest with yourself.

07:34.705 --> 07:36.206
Okay. What do you mean?

07:36.206 --> 07:38.250
- I mean, you're using
your disappointment over Ben

07:38.250 --> 07:40.210
as an excuse to put your walls back up.

07:40.210 --> 07:41.420
I can see it.

07:41.420 --> 07:43.463
Okay, maybe I'm protecting myself.

07:43.463 --> 07:47.718
But... it's because I saw myself
ending up with Ben,

07:47.718 --> 07:49.636
and then it turned out I was wrong,

07:49.636 --> 07:52.973
which means I was actually right,
and I end up alone.

07:52.973 --> 07:56.476
- Aww. Maybe Ben is the one.
Maybe he isn't. Maybe--

07:57.060 --> 07:58.187
Shh!

07:58.187 --> 08:00.230
- I wasn't talking.
- Hush, child.

08:01.690 --> 08:04.234
Who is the girthy Adonis you're talking to

08:04.234 --> 08:05.903
at some housewarming party?

08:05.903 --> 08:07.154
Oh, I'm not going to that party.

08:07.154 --> 08:08.864
- Oh, you are.
- I have no date prospects.

08:08.864 --> 08:10.532
- You do.
- My mom tried to set me up with someone,

08:10.532 --> 08:11.742
but I never called him back.

08:11.742 --> 08:13.535
- Trust me, you're going
to want to call this one back.

08:13.535 --> 08:16.663
He's got that muscly V thing
that goes right to the crotch.

08:18.290 --> 08:21.043
And this is me
high-fiving an elephant's paw.

08:21.043 --> 08:23.170
Wow. What's that like?

08:23.921 --> 08:26.131
- It's hard to explain,
but it's kind of like

08:26.131 --> 08:30.344
when two people...
slap hands together, I guess.

08:31.220 --> 08:32.221
Kind of.

08:33.805 --> 08:36.225
So how long did you live in Thailand?

08:36.225 --> 08:37.351
A week.

08:37.351 --> 08:40.479
Yeah, but it was a super,
super important week.

08:40.479 --> 08:42.397
- Yeah.
- I mean, like--

08:44.566 --> 08:45.651
Hmm.

08:45.651 --> 08:47.277
Can I interest you guys in some dessert?

08:47.277 --> 08:49.029
Oh, you don't want any, right?

08:49.029 --> 08:50.072
- No.
- No.

08:50.072 --> 08:51.782
I would actually love some.

08:51.782 --> 08:53.242
I'll get you a menu.

08:58.497 --> 09:00.624
- This girls' night
hasn't even started yet,

09:00.624 --> 09:02.334
and I already want to leave.

09:02.751 --> 09:05.420
You sure it's not weird
to bring a single tiny cucumber?

09:05.420 --> 09:07.256
No. Jessie strikes me as someone

09:07.256 --> 09:09.800
who's really into
water-forward vegetables.

09:09.800 --> 09:11.260
Okay, well, what did you bring?

09:11.260 --> 09:13.762
The cucumber's from both of us.

09:14.263 --> 09:15.430
- Come on.

09:16.682 --> 09:19.017
- Hi.
- Hi. This is from me.

09:19.017 --> 09:21.311
You're amazing for bringing this.

09:21.311 --> 09:23.689
- Is that a Persian?
- Yes.

09:23.689 --> 09:24.982
I love Persians.

09:24.982 --> 09:26.900
Oh, hi.

09:28.485 --> 09:30.696
I didn't know you all
were hanging out tonight.

09:30.696 --> 09:33.699
- Yeah. You got to have girls
for a girls' night.

09:33.699 --> 09:34.992
Right.

09:34.992 --> 09:36.159
Well, I'm, uh...

09:37.494 --> 09:39.079
I'm off to meet Dave.

09:39.079 --> 09:40.664
Aww, I love it when you two hang out,

09:40.664 --> 09:41.999
'cause it's still kind of about me.

09:41.999 --> 09:43.709
- Ah, it's not.
- Well.

09:44.334 --> 09:46.336
Um, have a good night.

09:47.796 --> 09:50.799
- Alright, Maggie. Spill it.
What happened with you two?

09:54.094 --> 09:55.888
- What do you mean?
- Your date?

09:56.555 --> 09:59.183
The landlord said you went out
with some meat prince.

09:59.183 --> 10:02.227
She was very excited
about the possibility of free ham.

10:02.227 --> 10:03.937
Your mom says hi, by the way.

10:03.937 --> 10:06.523
John. Yes, him.

10:07.858 --> 10:09.193
Who is this John?

10:09.193 --> 10:10.777
Very sweet, but not my thing.

10:10.777 --> 10:12.279
Well, what is your thing?

10:12.279 --> 10:15.824
- I mean, I'm a psychic, so I guess
I just want somebody unpredictable

10:15.824 --> 10:17.117
who can surprise me.

10:17.951 --> 10:19.578
John was ugly, wasn't he?

10:25.501 --> 10:27.753
Wow. I literally can't think of words

10:27.753 --> 10:28.962
and look at him at the same time.

10:30.464 --> 10:33.175
- Okay, Maggie, I love you,
even though you still haven't accepted

10:33.175 --> 10:34.510
my period app friend request.

10:34.510 --> 10:37.763
But I feel like I just,
I don't understand you

10:37.763 --> 10:39.848
if you don't want to go out
with this guy again.

10:39.848 --> 10:40.891
Let me see.

10:40.891 --> 10:43.560
- Well, listen, there are
some perks to being single.

10:44.269 --> 10:46.021
That being said,
it sounds like a nightmare.

10:46.021 --> 10:47.648
And I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy.

10:47.648 --> 10:49.024
That's why I'm married.

10:49.024 --> 10:50.776
Aren't you and Dave not married?

10:50.776 --> 10:53.237
Hmm. Not legally.

10:53.237 --> 10:54.738
We got married at Burning Man.

10:54.738 --> 10:57.199
It was officiated by an unlicensed wizard.

10:57.199 --> 11:00.452
- Oh.
- He builds Adirondack chairs!

11:00.452 --> 11:02.746
Maggie, what is wrong with you?

11:05.249 --> 11:07.876
So this guy lives in the sea,

11:07.876 --> 11:10.045
and he and the octopus are together?

11:10.045 --> 11:11.630
DAVE:
I don't think they put labels on it,

11:11.630 --> 11:14.758
but I got a good feeling
they're going to make it after all.

11:14.758 --> 11:16.385
I got a good feeling that octopus has

11:16.385 --> 11:17.803
no idea what's going on.

11:17.803 --> 11:20.806
- Ben, love is love,
even with a tentacle. Can't fight it.

11:22.599 --> 11:25.519
- Listen. Um, when did you know
my sister was the one?

11:25.978 --> 11:27.396
That's not a thing you know, mate.

11:27.396 --> 11:30.274
It's like how do you know
water feels good? It just does.

11:30.274 --> 11:31.525
Well, not always.

11:31.525 --> 11:32.734
Sometimes you drink the wrong kind,

11:32.734 --> 11:34.111
and it ruins the family vacation.

11:34.111 --> 11:36.697
- Okay, worrywart.
See, your problem is you think too much.

11:36.697 --> 11:38.448
Just feel.
Quick, what's your favorite direction?

11:38.448 --> 11:40.450
- Uh, what?
- Mine's forward and to the left.

11:40.450 --> 11:42.494
Stop thinking. Just answer.
What's your favorite time?

11:42.494 --> 11:44.830
- 11:11. Because it reminds me
of four tiny swords.

11:44.830 --> 11:47.207
- Alright. What's yours?

11:47.207 --> 11:48.250
My future with Amy.

11:48.917 --> 11:50.669
Wow. That was interesting.

11:51.086 --> 11:52.921
My intuition just taught me something.

11:52.921 --> 11:55.048
Your turn. Jessie, do you love her?

11:55.048 --> 11:56.049
Yeah, I do.

11:56.884 --> 11:58.677
Nice. What are you drinking?

11:58.677 --> 12:00.512
A crisp white would be nice.

12:00.512 --> 12:02.139
Your intuition is wrong. Two big beers.

12:02.139 --> 12:03.724
- Two big beers.
- Two big beers.

12:04.558 --> 12:06.393
JESSIE:
Alright. What do you think?

12:06.393 --> 12:08.270
- I love it.
- Yeah?

12:08.270 --> 12:09.271
-So good.
- So good.

12:09.271 --> 12:10.814
Yes. Okay.

12:10.814 --> 12:12.274
How much do I owe you?

12:12.274 --> 12:15.194
Um, let's see. Where's my wallet?

12:15.194 --> 12:17.946
Oh, there's the exotic cucumber
I gifted you.

12:17.946 --> 12:20.365
- It's on the house.
- What?

12:21.158 --> 12:22.326
Thank you.

12:22.326 --> 12:25.287
Who knew having a friend
who does hair is so awesome?

12:25.287 --> 12:29.082
- Oh my god. Are we allowed
to call each other friends now?

12:29.082 --> 12:31.168
- Yeah.
- I didn't want to, like, say it first

12:31.168 --> 12:33.045
and, you know, scare you guys off.

12:34.129 --> 12:35.547
I haven't made new friends in a while.

12:35.547 --> 12:36.798
Yeah, me neither.

12:36.798 --> 12:38.300
No, I get that for you.

12:38.759 --> 12:41.553
Makes me so upset
because you deserve everything.

12:42.012 --> 12:44.973
We all deserve everything.
Women are amazing.

12:46.517 --> 12:48.018
What did you see in Ben's reading?

12:50.812 --> 12:52.147
- Oh. Um--

12:52.147 --> 12:54.233
I'm sorry. I shouldn't ask that,

12:54.233 --> 12:55.651
but I've been wanting to all night.

12:55.651 --> 12:58.445
Um, Ben and I have been
off and on for a while,

12:58.445 --> 12:59.821
so I get in my head sometimes,

12:59.821 --> 13:02.199
and I was just wondering
if you saw me in his future.

13:03.116 --> 13:04.451
- Well--

13:04.451 --> 13:06.119
AMY:
Oh. That's the door.

13:09.998 --> 13:11.375
- Hi.
- Hi.

13:11.375 --> 13:12.584
I hope I'm in the right place.

13:12.584 --> 13:13.961
Maggie texted me to come by,

13:13.961 --> 13:15.921
told me to wear basketball shorts.

13:15.921 --> 13:17.965
Please have a seat in this chair.

13:17.965 --> 13:20.926
Or, you know, you can build one
or whatever you want.

13:20.926 --> 13:24.471
- I can do both.

13:24.471 --> 13:26.557
- Can I have that back?
- Yeah.

13:27.474 --> 13:28.475
There you go.

13:29.142 --> 13:30.310
I'm Louise, by the way.

13:30.310 --> 13:32.437
- Hi. I'm John.
- Hi.

13:34.982 --> 13:36.567
JOHN:
Oh, is that a Persian?

13:36.567 --> 13:38.318
Oh my god--

13:39.820 --> 13:41.697
Oh! Oh god.

13:41.697 --> 13:43.031
Whoa! Uh...

13:43.824 --> 13:45.909
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare you.

13:45.909 --> 13:48.453
- Yeah. You just keep
popping up everywhere, huh?

13:48.453 --> 13:49.872
- No more surprises.
- Yeah.

13:49.872 --> 13:51.832
- I, I promise.
- Hmm.

13:52.916 --> 13:53.917
- Keys.
- Your keys.

13:55.627 --> 13:57.171
Don't think. Just answer.

13:57.171 --> 13:58.463
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

13:59.423 --> 14:00.632
I'm going to ask her at the party.

14:02.801 --> 14:05.095
Well, I should get to bed.

14:06.680 --> 14:08.140
- Makes more sense now
than when you said it

14:08.140 --> 14:09.391
at four o'clock in the afternoon.

14:09.391 --> 14:10.392
Yep.

14:14.229 --> 14:16.273
How was your date with the Adonis?

14:16.273 --> 14:18.317
Physically, Helvetica.

14:18.317 --> 14:20.360
Emotionally, Wingdings.

14:20.986 --> 14:23.447
- Tiny wiener?
- I don't know. I didn't see it.

14:24.031 --> 14:25.699
Oh, well, there's always Ben.

14:25.699 --> 14:27.409
No, there isn't.

14:28.076 --> 14:30.454
I had a vision of him proposing to Jessie

14:30.454 --> 14:31.788
at their housewarming party.

14:31.788 --> 14:33.498
Fun.

14:33.498 --> 14:35.792
I love a tacky public engagement.

14:35.792 --> 14:37.628
It's my favorite part of straight culture.

14:37.628 --> 14:41.048
- Angel, why do you keep telling me
to be open-minded?

14:41.048 --> 14:43.675
Just tell me I'm doomed
and let me give up.

14:43.675 --> 14:46.178
I'm not like our clients.
I can handle the truth.

14:46.178 --> 14:47.387
Okay, here's the truth.

14:48.805 --> 14:52.059
Your problem is you can see the future,

14:52.643 --> 14:54.269
but you never see past it.

14:54.269 --> 14:55.771
What's past the future?

14:55.771 --> 14:57.064
Hope, honey.

14:58.065 --> 15:00.776
And that is something
that everybody needs.

15:00.776 --> 15:01.777
In that regard,

15:02.611 --> 15:04.363
you're no different than your clients.

15:04.363 --> 15:06.114
What am I even hoping for?

15:06.532 --> 15:08.534
- You'll know, when it walks
through your door.

15:09.993 --> 15:11.078
Oh.

15:11.870 --> 15:13.121
Oh, I need a Tums.

15:13.622 --> 15:15.374
Those tiny wieners go right through me.

15:16.875 --> 15:18.961
I am surprised to see you back.

15:18.961 --> 15:20.921
I don't know where else to go.

15:21.338 --> 15:23.298
Jo-Ann Fabric was closed,

15:23.298 --> 15:26.510
and the world just keeps
moving on without my bird.

15:26.510 --> 15:28.011
And I can't seem to--

15:28.846 --> 15:31.265
- I know what you mean.
- I'm just hopeless.

15:34.393 --> 15:35.769
You know what?

15:35.769 --> 15:38.522
Even psychics need to double-check
their work sometimes.

15:40.315 --> 15:41.608
Can I have your hands?

15:44.111 --> 15:45.112
- Mm.
<i>This bond</i>

15:45.112 --> 15:46.905
<i>between the octopus and its human--</i>

15:46.905 --> 15:48.282
I love you.

15:48.282 --> 15:49.575
Hmm.

15:50.576 --> 15:52.828
Well, I don't know
how to tell you this, Margot,

15:52.828 --> 15:54.997
but I do see a bird in your future.

15:55.289 --> 15:56.957
- Are we happy?
- Yeah.

16:00.335 --> 16:01.587
Thank you.

16:01.587 --> 16:03.046
Pain is a gift!

16:03.046 --> 16:05.340
It is everyone's--
Oh. Watch out, Margot.

16:06.049 --> 16:08.719
Uh, who are you? What are you doing?

16:08.719 --> 16:10.804
Please, don't make me go back out there.

16:10.804 --> 16:12.264
We have been running up and down

16:12.264 --> 16:14.683
the same staircase for 20 minutes.

16:14.683 --> 16:16.560
Yeah. You lost me at running.

16:16.560 --> 16:17.895
That's where they lost me, too.

16:17.895 --> 16:19.354
Oh god, I'm so sorry.

16:21.690 --> 16:25.652
- Well, I mean, you can hide
in here if you want.

16:25.652 --> 16:28.071
Can I? I won't touch anything.

16:28.071 --> 16:30.032
- Oh. I think you're going
to change your mind about that.

16:30.657 --> 16:31.658
Wow.

16:33.202 --> 16:34.494
You must be psychic.

16:35.913 --> 16:37.915
- So what do you do here?
- I'm a psychic.

16:38.790 --> 16:39.958
Well, that explains it.

16:42.252 --> 16:43.420
I'm Daniel, by the way.

16:43.420 --> 16:45.547
- Maggie.
- Thank you, Maggie.

16:46.423 --> 16:49.843
Maybe, just maybe, this will get me
through the battle ropes.

16:51.678 --> 16:54.598
- Well, turns out I like giving people
a little hope now and then.

16:56.850 --> 16:57.851
Look, um,

16:58.644 --> 17:01.522
I hate to ask you this
when you can see the outline

17:01.522 --> 17:03.357
of my nipples through my shirt.

17:03.357 --> 17:05.359
- Oh.
But, um...

17:07.903 --> 17:09.821
would you want to go out sometime?

17:12.157 --> 17:13.492
Actually, um,

17:15.285 --> 17:16.745
what are you doing tonight?

17:16.745 --> 17:19.414
I may or may not die from CrossFit,

17:19.414 --> 17:21.875
but if I'm alive, I'm available.

17:21.875 --> 17:23.877
Perfect.

17:29.800 --> 17:30.884
Thank you.

17:31.343 --> 17:33.428
Hi. Thanks for coming.

17:33.428 --> 17:35.222
Oh, bar's over there. Food's inside.

17:36.014 --> 17:38.517
Uh, the party does end at 10:00,
but have a great time.

17:38.517 --> 17:39.685
You look great, by the way.

17:39.685 --> 17:42.229
I almost didn't recognize you
with your nipples covered.

17:42.229 --> 17:44.314
Oh, don't worry. They're still there.

17:45.983 --> 17:48.360
- So glad you decided to come.
- Thanks for having me.

17:48.360 --> 17:50.404
Yeah. So, what were you doing today?

17:50.404 --> 17:52.739
- Oh, I was counting trees
all throughout my neighborhood.

17:52.739 --> 17:54.533
Oh. How many were there?

17:54.533 --> 17:56.451
- Two.
- Oh, okay.

17:58.662 --> 18:01.373
Oh my gosh. John is so fascinating.

18:01.373 --> 18:03.625
Did you know that he's found every Waldo?

18:03.625 --> 18:05.669
- Yeah. That was
the first thing he told me.

18:05.669 --> 18:08.046
Oh, hey, Maggie. Have you seen Dave?

18:08.046 --> 18:09.673
Not like in the future, but like now.

18:09.673 --> 18:11.008
Oh no, I haven't seen him in either.

18:11.008 --> 18:12.426
Oh, I bet John could find him.

18:12.426 --> 18:13.677
- Oh, okay.
- Mm-hmm.

18:14.636 --> 18:17.431
- Have you seen Dave?

18:18.056 --> 18:21.393
- Oh.
- Hi. Uh, thank you all so much for coming

18:21.393 --> 18:25.147
to celebrate this new chapter
for Jessie and me.

18:25.731 --> 18:26.773
There's a lot that could be said

18:26.773 --> 18:29.568
for finding the right person in your life.

18:30.986 --> 18:34.489
Which brings us to what
this night is really about.

18:35.991 --> 18:36.992
Dave.

18:39.620 --> 18:41.788
- Thanks, mate.
Where's Amy?

18:42.414 --> 18:44.333
- Um--
- Sorry. Excuse me.

18:44.333 --> 18:46.376
Oh god. There you are.

18:46.376 --> 18:48.921
- Dave, what are you doing?
- You're as beautiful today

18:48.921 --> 18:51.089
as the day when we maybe
got married at Burning Man.

18:51.089 --> 18:52.508
Oh.

18:52.508 --> 18:53.926
And I'm not even on mushrooms.

18:55.886 --> 18:57.763
I've never looked back from that moment.

18:59.389 --> 19:00.390
But recently,

19:03.477 --> 19:06.313
I've been finding myself looking forward
and a little to the left.

19:07.064 --> 19:08.357
Your favorite direction?

19:08.357 --> 19:11.276
- That's my favorite direction.
You know me so well.

19:11.902 --> 19:13.654
I know I have my head
in the clouds sometimes

19:13.654 --> 19:15.447
and I don't always read
your text messages,

19:15.447 --> 19:17.324
especially when you send a bunch in a row.

19:18.408 --> 19:20.202
But I don't want to go
another day wondering

19:20.202 --> 19:22.788
if that wizard that married us
had a license or not.

19:26.875 --> 19:28.919
Aww!

19:29.211 --> 19:31.547
Will you marry me? For real this time?

19:31.547 --> 19:33.590
Yes. Of course.

19:33.590 --> 19:35.634
- Yes, yes, yes, of course.
- Yes!

19:35.634 --> 19:36.760
Yes!

19:36.760 --> 19:38.470
- Woo!

19:44.226 --> 19:46.061
- She said yes!
- Yes!

19:46.061 --> 19:48.564
Ooh, I did not see that coming.

19:48.564 --> 19:51.733
- Me neither.
I had no idea he was Australian.

19:52.651 --> 19:54.319
Yeah, I'm just hearing it now.

19:58.782 --> 19:59.992
BEN:
Let me guess--

19:59.992 --> 20:01.660
texting that you looked for me
to say good night

20:01.660 --> 20:03.078
but now you need to get to bed?

20:03.078 --> 20:04.830
Oh, this is awkward.

20:04.830 --> 20:07.624
I didn't save your number.
What's your name again?

20:09.668 --> 20:10.836
I need to ask you something.

20:11.753 --> 20:13.881
- Oh.
- I'm going to ask her at the party.

20:14.840 --> 20:17.426
- You were going to ask me.
- Well, we haven't talked.

20:17.426 --> 20:20.429
And it's weird that I moved
into your duplex with my girlfriend,

20:20.429 --> 20:22.389
especially after we, you know.

20:22.389 --> 20:24.266
Took the D train to V town.

20:25.142 --> 20:27.394
- I was going to say
"spent a lovely night together."

20:27.394 --> 20:28.604
Oh.

20:28.604 --> 20:30.272
Which is kind of the problem.

20:30.272 --> 20:31.315
You're pregnant.

20:33.275 --> 20:35.944
- I wanted to ask
if I should tell Jessie about us.

20:36.403 --> 20:37.821
- Oh.
- I love her.

20:38.947 --> 20:40.365
And I don't want to hurt her.

20:41.783 --> 20:44.161
Oh, gorgeous.

20:45.704 --> 20:48.874
- You know, I think the truth
can hurt people sometimes.

20:48.874 --> 20:52.127
And maybe it's better if we just

20:52.127 --> 20:53.754
leave the past in the past.

20:53.754 --> 20:54.922
Yeah, yeah.

20:55.964 --> 20:56.965
You're probably right.

20:58.383 --> 21:01.053
What about us? We'll be okay?

21:01.595 --> 21:02.763
Yeah, we're friends.

21:04.389 --> 21:05.390
We're friends.

21:06.266 --> 21:07.518
Good news.

21:07.518 --> 21:10.354
She must see you in her future
if she's keeping you around, huh?

21:13.440 --> 21:14.858
Hey. There you are.

21:15.901 --> 21:16.902
That used to be my line.

21:17.736 --> 21:19.363
- Good night.
- Good night.

21:20.197 --> 21:21.365
- Nice guy.
Yeah.

21:23.867 --> 21:25.661
Um, do you want to get another drink?

21:25.661 --> 21:27.454
- You know, I'm actually not
a huge fan of parties.

21:27.454 --> 21:28.497
Oh?

21:28.497 --> 21:30.707
- There's just something
about the talking and the people

21:30.707 --> 21:32.125
and the talking to people.

21:32.125 --> 21:34.253
- Totally.

21:34.253 --> 21:35.879
Well, my place is right upstairs,

21:35.879 --> 21:37.422
and we don't have to talk to anybody.

21:37.422 --> 21:38.632
Oh.

21:38.632 --> 21:41.051
Uh, well, you know, it's a good thing

21:41.051 --> 21:42.928
I have a lot of practice with stairs.

21:43.512 --> 21:46.473
- Do you?
- Well, you know, I almost died today.

21:47.891 --> 21:49.309
- We'll take it step-by-step.

Oh, um--

Have you seen one of our students?

22:13.917 --> 22:15.878
Scruffy, brutal BMI.

- Smells like cookies.
- I haven't seen him. Sorry.
