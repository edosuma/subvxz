WEBVTT

02:15.017 --> 02:16.640
Where are y'all headed?

02:16.674 --> 02:18.607
Well, we're trying to get up
to Santa Susana Pass Road

02:18.642 --> 02:20.161
but however far you can take us.

02:20.195 --> 02:21.990
- Oh, Spahn Ranch?
- Hey, yeah. How did you know?

02:22.024 --> 02:24.993
Yeah, well, not quite, uh,
all the way up there.

02:25.027 --> 02:26.960
My, uh, my aunt lives nearby.

02:30.861 --> 02:32.621
What you got there?

02:32.656 --> 02:35.245
Some money, I guess.

02:35.279 --> 02:37.281
Hey, if you're gonna take us
all the way

02:37.316 --> 02:39.456
we should buy you breakfast.

02:39.490 --> 02:40.664
Right on.

02:54.125 --> 02:55.575
I don't know.

02:55.610 --> 02:57.025
I thought
"Tiptoe Through The Tulips"

02:57.059 --> 02:59.510
was a pretty far-out song
if you're a little high.

03:00.753 --> 03:03.273
I guess I was a lot high
when I first heard it.

03:03.307 --> 03:04.895
Seems like a fag to me.

03:04.929 --> 03:06.517
Hey, watch it.

03:06.552 --> 03:08.899
Tex here told the army
he was an acid head homosexual

03:08.933 --> 03:10.590
to get out of the war, so..

03:10.625 --> 03:12.937
I'm not actually a homosexual.

03:12.972 --> 03:15.492
I mean, who sings like that?

03:15.526 --> 03:17.321
Guy with his voice
all high like a girl

03:17.356 --> 03:19.081
and his tiny
little whatchamacallit.

03:19.116 --> 03:20.600
It's a put on.

03:22.533 --> 03:24.639
Everything's a put on.

03:24.673 --> 03:27.262
Tiny Tim is just having fun.

03:27.297 --> 03:29.230
Hey, we better get out of here.

03:49.871 --> 03:51.459

Wow. I thought

05:18.684 --> 05:21.376
- Mm-hmm.
- Thank you.

05:21.411 --> 05:24.137
Pardon me, ladies.
Karlene, can I speak with you?

05:24.172 --> 05:27.451
- Sure.
- Ooh.

05:27.486 --> 05:29.246
You guys, go ahead.

05:34.147 --> 05:35.770
I need your help
with the Manson girls

05:35.804 --> 05:37.530
over
in the Special Security Unit.

05:37.565 --> 05:38.842
Since the death penalty
was lifted

05:38.876 --> 05:40.844
no one knows
what to do with them.

05:40.878 --> 05:43.709
The Governor doesn't want them in general population

05:43.743 --> 05:46.228
so they are on death row
indefinitely.

05:47.885 --> 05:51.130
Just the three of them, stuck in those cells 23 hours a day.

05:53.132 --> 05:55.065
I can't let them rot in there.

06:06.766 --> 06:07.905
Good morning, ladies.

06:07.940 --> 06:09.838
- Hi, Miss Carlson.
- Hello, Miss Carlson.

06:09.873 --> 06:12.151
I'd like you to meet
Karlene Faith.

06:12.185 --> 06:14.153
- Hi, Karlene.
- Nice to meet you, Karlene.

06:14.187 --> 06:15.430
Nice to meet you all.

06:15.465 --> 06:17.536
Karlene is a graduate student
at UC, Santa Cruz

06:17.570 --> 06:20.193
and she teaches
some of the inmates here.

06:20.228 --> 06:21.919
Now that you're gonna be
staying with us

06:21.954 --> 06:23.714
I think it's a good time

06:23.749 --> 06:25.682
to talk about taking
some classes with her.

06:25.716 --> 06:28.823
So that -- that means
we are staying in the SSU
for good then?

06:29.962 --> 06:32.723
Let's not get ahead
of ourselves.

06:32.758 --> 06:36.417
We're offering college courses
to residents here.

06:36.451 --> 06:38.764
You'd be free to study
just about anything you want.

06:38.798 --> 06:41.698
Literature, Philosophy,
Journalism.

06:41.732 --> 06:43.354
Are we gonna learn about shit
like Women's Lib?

06:43.389 --> 06:45.080
Language, please, Susan.

06:47.635 --> 06:49.913
We don't have to study
Women's Lib, no

06:49.947 --> 06:52.433
although I do teach a Women's
Studies course here in CIW.

06:52.467 --> 06:55.056
Women's Studies.

06:55.090 --> 06:56.298

06:57.507 --> 06:58.853
I'll leave you ladies to it.

06:58.887 --> 07:00.613

- Bye, Miss Carlson.

07:00.648 --> 07:03.305
- Bye, Miss Carlson.
- Oh, thank you, Jimmy.

07:03.340 --> 07:04.479
- Thanks, Jimmy.
- Thank you, Jimmy.

07:04.514 --> 07:06.964
Hey, Karlene,
do you want some grape Tang?

07:06.999 --> 07:08.103
Pretty please, Jimmy,
can we have

07:08.138 --> 07:09.380
some grape Tang for our guest?

07:09.415 --> 07:11.037

My name's Charlie.

10:04.935 --> 10:06.799
Where did you find her?

10:06.834 --> 10:09.699
She was hanging around my harem
for a while.

10:09.733 --> 10:12.391
But it was turning into a bad
scene with my old lady.

10:12.425 --> 10:15.049
Beautiful Brother Bobby.

10:15.083 --> 10:17.223
He really knows
how to make love to the girls.

10:17.258 --> 10:18.259
That's what they all tell me.

10:18.293 --> 10:19.778
Sadie's made love to Bobby,
right?

10:19.812 --> 10:21.745
Yeah, we've all made love to him
at this point, huh?

10:22.988 --> 10:24.575
I can't take
another man's woman.

10:24.610 --> 10:26.405
She's not mine, Charlie.

10:26.439 --> 10:28.683
Gypsy told me all about you
and the family.

10:28.718 --> 10:30.651
- I can't take her.
- Charlie.

10:31.893 --> 10:33.861
I think we should let her stay.

10:35.207 --> 10:37.692
She digs us and she's hungry.

10:37.727 --> 10:39.073
She's a seeker.

10:43.767 --> 10:46.287
Where are your parents?

10:46.321 --> 10:48.876
It doesn't matter to me.
I'm on my own journey.

10:48.910 --> 10:51.188
Well, what do you have for us?
Do you have a car?

10:51.223 --> 10:52.776
- No.
- Well, then we'll get you one.

10:52.811 --> 10:56.987
We'll get you a car.
We'll find you a car.

10:57.022 --> 10:58.817
You know why? Because old ego
is a too much thing.

10:58.851 --> 11:00.750
Old ego is a too much thing.
He'll make you fool yourself.

11:00.784 --> 11:01.751
You'll think
you're somebody else.

11:01.785 --> 11:04.063
You'll ride
that whole subway train.

11:08.481 --> 11:11.036
You like her, you teach her.

11:11.070 --> 11:13.038
You keep an eye on her,
and you see
if she belongs with us.

11:13.072 --> 11:14.971
And ,you,
Katie is my everything.

11:15.005 --> 11:17.456
Katie is me. You pay attention
to what she does.

11:17.490 --> 11:20.908
If you're even half as good
as her, then you can stay.

11:27.052 --> 11:30.227
When I first met Charlie,
I just knew.

11:31.781 --> 11:33.852
Hopped on a bus
and I never looked back.

11:35.854 --> 11:39.720
But Charlie's like a...beacon
of light or something.

11:41.376 --> 11:43.137
I mean, look at you,
you're here.

11:44.448 --> 11:46.002
- Hey, Tex.
- Hello there.

11:46.036 --> 11:47.244
How you doing?

11:49.108 --> 11:51.076
Tex hasn't reached
awareness yet.

11:52.629 --> 11:54.700
He's still working
on letting go of his ego.

11:58.704 --> 12:00.948
Charlie says,
"Let go of your ego

12:00.982 --> 12:03.916
and be like a finger
on a hand."

12:06.022 --> 12:09.094
Come on.
I want you to meet George.

12:09.128 --> 12:11.234
George Spahn. It's his ranch.

12:11.268 --> 12:12.545
Hello?

12:23.694 --> 12:25.904
Squeaky is so kind to him.

12:25.938 --> 12:29.010
- She's a generous soul.
- I'll say.

12:29.045 --> 12:30.909
It's beautiful here.

12:30.943 --> 12:33.359
We don't get hung up about sex.
You get it?

12:34.257 --> 12:36.811
We just be.

12:36.846 --> 12:38.709
We let things happen.

12:38.744 --> 12:40.850
We let go.

12:40.884 --> 12:42.955
I think you're gonna love it.

12:42.990 --> 12:44.819
Hurry up now, everybody.
Come on.

12:44.854 --> 12:47.028
- Dennis.
- Hey, girl.

12:49.686 --> 12:51.999
And who is this pretty thing?

12:52.033 --> 12:54.139
- I'm Leslie.
- Ah, welcome.

12:54.173 --> 12:56.693
I'm not in this family, but..

12:57.936 --> 12:59.800
...I dig this family.

13:01.387 --> 13:02.526
Hi.

13:08.325 --> 13:10.362
Beach Boys Dennis?

13:10.396 --> 13:12.122
That's really Dennis Wilson?

13:12.157 --> 13:15.022
- He's just Dennis to us.
- Time for communion.

13:17.748 --> 13:19.785
You've turned on before,
right?

13:19.820 --> 13:20.993
Millions of times.

13:21.028 --> 13:24.583
Just, uh, wasn't expecting it
right now.

13:45.638 --> 13:47.571
I spent my life in jail for you.

13:49.263 --> 13:51.886
So that you could ride
your bicycles.

13:51.921 --> 13:53.543
Have your birthday parties.

13:55.200 --> 13:57.892
I never had a life.
I don't even know what life is.

13:58.997 --> 14:01.896
But you all had a life.

14:01.931 --> 14:04.278
Your parents told you what to do
and you did it.

14:04.312 --> 14:05.831
And for payment, you got what?

14:05.866 --> 14:08.247
You got
little cookie cutter minds.

14:10.732 --> 14:13.252
Look what happened to Sandy.

14:13.287 --> 14:15.910
Spoiled Sandy.

14:15.945 --> 14:18.050
Spoiled Sandy had to come
to her new daddy

14:18.085 --> 14:20.121
to find something real.

14:24.643 --> 14:26.817
Take off your clothes for us,
Sandy.

14:35.378 --> 14:36.517
Do it.

14:48.805 --> 14:51.221
Help her. Come on.
Can't you see she needs help?

14:56.226 --> 14:57.331
Tex.

14:59.160 --> 15:00.541
Get up here.

15:01.438 --> 15:02.577
Go on.

15:33.367 --> 15:36.991
Now you look at how
parents abuse their children.

15:37.026 --> 15:38.648
If they loved her

15:38.682 --> 15:41.823
why did they allow doctors
to cut up her body like this?

15:43.894 --> 15:46.690
And then they felt bad

15:46.725 --> 15:48.830
and then they spoiled her.

15:51.247 --> 15:53.732
And now Sandy can't let go
of her ego.

15:55.251 --> 15:57.978
It's not your fault,
it's your parents' fault.

15:58.012 --> 15:59.945
Would you say that to me?

16:01.119 --> 16:03.052
It's my parents' fault.

16:04.225 --> 16:06.158
And it's not your fault.

16:08.333 --> 16:09.990
It's not my fault.

16:12.647 --> 16:13.994
Now turn around.

16:15.650 --> 16:18.136
It's not your fault.

16:19.378 --> 16:20.931
It's not my fault.

16:20.966 --> 16:22.588
It's your parents' fault.

16:22.623 --> 16:25.039
It's my parents' fault.

16:28.629 --> 16:32.115
Now come and tell her
that she looks beautiful.

16:32.150 --> 16:34.531
- You look beautiful, Sandy.
- You look beautiful.

16:34.566 --> 16:36.740
- You're beautiful.
- Perfect.

16:38.639 --> 16:40.020
You look beautiful.

16:41.090 --> 16:42.505
We love you so much.

16:45.818 --> 16:47.544
You look so beautiful.

17:22.786 --> 17:24.754
You are beautiful, Sandy.

17:46.431 --> 17:48.674
So he led Katie away

17:48.709 --> 17:52.022
and I asked Squeaky
if Katie was Charlie's old lady.

17:53.093 --> 17:55.060
And Squeaky told me

17:55.095 --> 17:57.856
"Nobody belongs
to anybody here

17:57.890 --> 17:59.858
"except Charlie.

17:59.892 --> 18:03.137
We all belong to Charlie."

18:03.172 --> 18:06.036
I thought
that was pretty far out.

18:06.071 --> 18:09.523
Then she says, "If you're lucky,
he'll pick you next."

18:09.557 --> 18:12.284
Every girl should have a daddy
like Charlie.

18:17.945 --> 18:21.845
Something for you to take a look
at for next week.

18:28.576 --> 18:30.992
The Bible is the only book
Charlie let us have around.

18:31.027 --> 18:32.477
Charlie says
that authors are evil.

18:32.511 --> 18:34.237
Trying to play mind tricks
on the reader.

18:34.272 --> 18:37.758
So do you feel like
you'd be doing something bad

18:37.792 --> 18:39.553
by studying with me?

18:39.587 --> 18:41.969
Because if you are going
to do these classes with me

18:42.003 --> 18:43.936
you're going to have
to read books.

18:46.146 --> 18:50.080
I'm also gonna leave
a copy of this.

18:50.115 --> 18:52.048
Have any of you read it?

18:53.912 --> 18:55.879
This book changed my life.

18:57.122 --> 19:00.194
It looks like
it could be interesting.

19:00.229 --> 19:04.267
Can you believe Charles Manson
wouldn't let them read?

19:04.302 --> 19:08.237
It's been three years since
they had any contact with him.

19:08.271 --> 19:11.067
But all they do
is talk about him

19:11.101 --> 19:13.897
and spout his bullshit.

19:13.932 --> 19:16.141
I want you to come talk to them.

19:16.176 --> 19:17.936
You should do
your poetry workshop.

19:17.970 --> 19:19.696
No way.

19:19.731 --> 19:22.630
There are real victims
in this prison.

19:22.665 --> 19:24.598
They're the ones I wanna help.

19:25.944 --> 19:27.877
Maybe these women
are victims too.

19:27.911 --> 19:29.879
Would you be saying that
if it was your sister?

19:29.913 --> 19:33.262
Your pregnant sister
who got stabbed 20 times.

19:43.686 --> 19:44.963
It's Leslie's shower time

19:44.997 --> 19:47.172
so it's your time
in the yard, Pat.

19:49.209 --> 19:52.764
And, Susan, I guess it's just
gonna be you and me for a bit.

19:52.798 --> 19:55.905
Perfect opportunity
for a hand job.

19:55.939 --> 19:58.839
Just teasing, Jimmy.
I know you love your Alice!

20:04.603 --> 20:06.916
Oh, there you go. Wow.

20:06.950 --> 20:09.436
Those tomatoes
are looking great.

20:09.470 --> 20:11.403
We'll give you some

21:09.392 --> 21:11.394
You're coming with me.

21:11.429 --> 21:12.982

21:51.538 --> 21:53.574
Uh, who here likes
the New Western?

21:53.609 --> 21:57.060
Okay, well, guess what. "Bonanza," "The Lone Ranger.."

21:57.095 --> 22:00.719
- How do you like our bus?
- It's far out.

22:00.754 --> 22:02.859
It's a joke on all the straights we pass on the road.

22:02.894 --> 22:04.827
They think we're a movie crew.

22:06.138 --> 22:08.589

I have a new rule.

22:08.624 --> 22:11.316
No women will ever carry money.
Not even pennies, you dig?

22:11.351 --> 22:12.593
That's why I'm sending Paul
with you.

22:12.628 --> 22:15.320
You give your panhandling money
to him.

22:15.355 --> 22:18.358
You...you still here?

22:20.360 --> 22:22.672
Alright, good.
Well, give your money to Paul.

No.

- Yes, Charlie.

24:51.925 --> 24:53.892
And why is that, Katie?

24:53.927 --> 24:55.860
- I'm living in the now.
- Mm-hmm.

24:55.894 --> 24:58.828
I don't need a soulless gadget
to tell me how to live.

24:58.863 --> 25:00.347
I don't wanna be
like the plastic people.

25:00.381 --> 25:01.935
Exactly.

25:01.969 --> 25:04.558
That's what our parents
and our schools taught us.

25:04.593 --> 25:07.423
You live by these numbers.
You play by these rules.

25:07.457 --> 25:08.873
That time is over.

25:08.907 --> 25:11.496
I'm here to make the new rules
and the new rules are no rules.

25:11.531 --> 25:12.601
Oh, yeah.

25:41.699 --> 25:45.185
I think it's time for us
to give you a name.

25:45.219 --> 25:47.843
Now what is it those, uh,
those people named you

25:47.877 --> 25:50.466
the ones you occupied a house
with and called a family?

25:50.500 --> 25:52.468
- Les--
- No, I don't wanna know.

25:57.680 --> 25:59.199
You're gonna be Lulu.

26:00.545 --> 26:01.926
Welcome, Lulu.

26:03.790 --> 26:04.963
Welcome.

26:07.207 --> 26:09.899
Yeah, what do we think
of that, guys? Lulu.

26:09.934 --> 26:12.074
- Yeah! There we go.
- Lulu.

26:12.108 --> 26:14.939
- Lulu.
- Hi, Lulu.

26:14.973 --> 26:16.216
- Lulu.
- That's far out!

26:16.250 --> 26:20.013
- Hi, little Lulu.
- Hi, Lulu.

26:20.047 --> 26:21.255
See, what we're trying
to do here is

26:21.290 --> 26:22.843
we're trying to break down
inhibitions.

26:22.878 --> 26:25.259
We're trying to live
in our bodies every night.

26:25.294 --> 26:27.710
Touch each other.
Touch yourselves.

26:27.745 --> 26:29.091
See?

26:42.691 --> 26:45.383
It's not a foreign country.
Your body's like a plant.

26:45.417 --> 26:48.938
If you don't give it love,
then...it will die.

27:20.832 --> 27:23.973
A little birdie told me Tex here
doesn't know how to give head.

27:25.319 --> 27:27.736
To me, man,
that's -- that's a crime.

27:27.770 --> 27:29.496
- Come on, Charlie.
- Now don't get uptight, man.

27:29.530 --> 27:31.532
I want my family to know
each other in every way.

27:31.567 --> 27:33.293
We got no secrets.
We got no shame.

27:33.327 --> 27:36.089
It's not your fault
that no one taught you.

27:36.123 --> 27:38.401
- You heard of Freud?
- Yeah.

27:38.436 --> 27:40.093
Well, looky here, man.

27:40.127 --> 27:43.441
The dude was always talking
about oral fixations.

27:43.475 --> 27:45.754
I mean, we all got 'em.

27:45.788 --> 27:47.721
Cat was right.
You need to suck on something.

27:47.756 --> 27:50.137
That's why you got a mouth.
That's why women got titties.

27:50.172 --> 27:51.587
You see kids?
They're always sucking

27:51.621 --> 27:52.968
on their thumbs
or their fingers

27:53.002 --> 27:54.970
or they're chewing on suckers
or jawbreakers.

27:55.004 --> 27:56.592
And people are always
sticking pickles

27:56.626 --> 27:58.732
or smokes and zuzus
in their face, you dig?

27:58.767 --> 28:02.322
Point is, Tex, if you're gonna
suck on something

28:02.356 --> 28:04.358
then you better be
fucking good at it, man.

28:06.084 --> 28:08.431
Gypsy, you get your fine ass
up here now. Come on now.

28:09.709 --> 28:11.607
Don't get uptight, man.
Come on.

28:11.641 --> 28:13.816
We got no secrets.
We got no shame.

28:16.405 --> 28:17.544
Now look.

28:19.615 --> 28:21.582
Oh, alright. I see you.

28:23.964 --> 28:26.380
You see this guy? This is
the guy who needs attention.

28:26.415 --> 28:28.279
- Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

28:28.313 --> 28:30.557
But you gotta be slow,
like you care.

28:31.834 --> 28:33.560
Come on now.

28:41.119 --> 28:42.914
Give it to her, Tex.

29:20.296 --> 29:21.642
It's okay.

29:45.252 --> 29:48.048
Don't get uptight
about Sandy, man.

29:49.187 --> 29:51.224
She's having an ego death.

29:51.258 --> 29:54.365
What we're trying to do here,
man, is submit. Let go.

29:54.399 --> 29:57.955
Get rid of materialistic culture
of hang-ups. You dig?

29:59.335 --> 30:00.889
We're all about love here.

30:00.923 --> 30:04.340
Except sometimes, there has
to be some death itself.

30:06.101 --> 30:07.792
Changes, tears.

30:10.139 --> 30:11.347
Weird trips.

30:12.659 --> 30:14.868
That's how it is.

30:14.903 --> 30:17.008
That's how it's always been.

30:55.391 --> 30:57.773
Oh, that's cool. You're not
into it. That's okay.

30:59.568 --> 31:01.397
You don't have to do anything
you don't wanna do here.

31:01.432 --> 31:03.606
It's not, that's not
what we're about.

31:05.954 --> 31:07.472
Let's just go back.

31:08.715 --> 31:10.820
No. I -- I want to...

31:11.994 --> 31:13.996
stay here with you right now.

31:36.639 --> 31:38.710
What is it you don't like
about your body?

31:39.919 --> 31:42.473
Come on now,
you hate something.

31:42.507 --> 31:44.716
All women do.
What is it, tits too small?

31:45.579 --> 31:46.787
Huh?

31:48.272 --> 31:49.549
Ass too big?

31:51.171 --> 31:53.587
What is it for Lulu?
No, don't you hide for me.

31:54.657 --> 31:56.625
Tell me what it is
that you hate.

31:59.041 --> 32:00.870
My thighs, I guess.

32:01.975 --> 32:03.977
- Too fat.
- No.

32:06.462 --> 32:07.739
You are perfect.
You say it to me.

32:07.774 --> 32:09.051
You say I am perfect.

32:10.501 --> 32:12.468
I am perfect.

32:12.503 --> 32:13.676
I am perfect.

32:15.299 --> 32:17.025
I am perfect.

32:17.059 --> 32:18.958
I am perfect.

32:18.992 --> 32:20.511
I am perfect.

32:32.074 --> 32:33.662
Hey, little girl.

32:35.940 --> 32:37.355
Now listen to me.

32:37.390 --> 32:41.670
If you wanna be free
of all the bad experiences

32:41.704 --> 32:43.568
and inhibitions
that are crushing you

32:43.603 --> 32:47.262
you have to imagine that you are
making love to your daddy, okay?

32:47.296 --> 32:50.748
That's what all the girls want
and can never have.

33:05.866 --> 33:09.939
Ladies, we have our own
special cell for school now.

33:11.424 --> 33:13.667
I'm not sure what you all did
to make Miss Carlson

33:13.702 --> 33:16.360
like you so much,
but she gave the okay.

33:17.464 --> 33:18.810
Thanks, Jimmy.

33:25.196 --> 33:27.026
It's been a long time.

33:28.682 --> 33:31.340
Ah, I'm sorry, ladies.
I'm gonna have to break that up.

33:31.375 --> 33:33.894
- It's not really allowed to..
- Okay.

33:37.588 --> 33:39.279
Ta-da.

33:39.314 --> 33:41.247
- Lovely.
- Yeah.

33:42.903 --> 33:44.181
Okay.

33:48.875 --> 33:52.223
Okay.
Let's talk about this one.

33:52.258 --> 33:55.537
- Did you all read it?
- It was horrible.

33:55.571 --> 33:57.539
It was very depressing.

33:57.573 --> 33:59.851
I felt really bad for the women
in those situations.

34:01.267 --> 34:05.098
A lot of women right here
in this prison

34:05.133 --> 34:07.859
are survivors
of domestic violence.

34:07.894 --> 34:09.896
They defended themselves

34:09.930 --> 34:12.036
and this is where
it landed them.

34:12.071 --> 34:14.107
That is so sad.

34:14.142 --> 34:16.489
That makes me really sad.

34:16.523 --> 34:19.457
Are you friends with them?
Do you help them?

34:19.492 --> 34:20.803
Yes, and yes.

34:20.838 --> 34:24.773
I'm working with a woman now
who's trying

34:24.807 --> 34:27.362
not to let her daughter
be put into foster care.

34:27.396 --> 34:29.433
She killed her abusive husband

34:29.467 --> 34:33.057
she went to prison,
and now her kid has no parents.

34:33.092 --> 34:35.024
- What's her name?
- How long is she in for?

34:35.059 --> 34:36.509
How old is her kid?

34:38.131 --> 34:40.651
I'm not really allowed
to give details like that.

34:40.685 --> 34:42.722
Well, what about you?
Do you have kids?

34:42.756 --> 34:45.034
Yes. I have four kids.

34:46.553 --> 34:49.038
And what does your husband do?

34:49.073 --> 34:50.971
As much as I'd love
to talk about me

34:51.006 --> 34:52.249
I am here to teach you

34:52.283 --> 34:54.596
and I am not a subject
that merits a college class.

34:57.254 --> 34:59.635
I feel so lucky.

34:59.670 --> 35:01.948
We'll have to decorate.
Make things for it.

35:01.982 --> 35:04.330
- It's like being home again.
- Yeah.

35:04.364 --> 35:06.090
The family BC.

35:06.125 --> 35:08.610
- BC?
- Before the crimes.

35:09.507 --> 35:11.095
When everything was about love.

35:11.130 --> 35:13.546
Yeah. Like when Mary gave birth
to Pooh Bear.

35:13.580 --> 35:16.307
And we all witnessed
the miracle.

35:20.277 --> 35:22.762
- You can do it.
- Yeah. You got this, mama.

35:22.796 --> 35:29.148
- One, two, three, push!
- One, two, three, push!

35:30.908 --> 35:32.599
- Charlie's here.
- It's alright, baby.

35:32.634 --> 35:34.705
It's alright. It's alright.
Nice and easy.

35:34.739 --> 35:36.327
Paul, why don't you play
some music?

35:36.362 --> 35:38.985
We want this motherfucker
to come out dancing, right?

35:39.019 --> 35:40.504
You just push, honey.
You take it easy.

35:40.538 --> 35:42.161
Go with the motion.

35:42.195 --> 35:44.680
Go with the motion, Mary.

35:44.715 --> 35:47.683
Somebody get me a razor blade
and sterilize it for me, please?

35:48.926 --> 35:50.169
Come on, darling.
Come on, darling.

35:50.203 --> 35:51.342
You can take it
nice and easy now.

35:51.377 --> 35:53.206
You take it nice and easy now, alright?

35:53.241 --> 35:55.933
Just go with the motion,
darling.

35:55.967 --> 35:57.452
You're gonna go with the motion.
Alright.

35:57.486 --> 35:58.660
Great, I'm gonna make
a little cut now.

35:58.694 --> 36:02.353
- Charlie!
- One, two, three.

36:02.388 --> 36:04.113
Oh, no, you're gonna give it
to me right now.

36:04.148 --> 36:06.771
Give it to me now.
Oh, there we go. There we go.

36:06.806 --> 36:08.566
That's it, come on,
one more, one more time!

36:08.601 --> 36:10.775
One more time! One more time!
One more time now.

36:12.846 --> 36:14.331
Come on, darling!
Here we go, here we go!

36:14.365 --> 36:16.954
Come on! Come on! Come on!

36:16.988 --> 36:18.852
Come on now.
You give me that squeeze!

36:18.887 --> 36:21.407
- Push!
- Come on! Come on! Come on!

36:21.441 --> 36:23.823
Push!

36:23.857 --> 36:25.997
That's alright. That is coming!

36:26.032 --> 36:27.482
Oh, yeah. Oh, we got it!

36:27.516 --> 36:29.311
We got it! Oh!

36:29.346 --> 36:31.555
Dig this. The little
motherfucker, man, he's out!

36:31.589 --> 36:33.384
Woo! Yee-haw!

36:33.419 --> 36:36.594
Alright, we got a baby!
We got a baby!

36:36.629 --> 36:38.562
We got a baby!

36:38.596 --> 36:40.253
Dig this little dude, Mary.

36:40.288 --> 36:42.151
Take this little one.

36:42.186 --> 36:43.532
Alright now, alright.

36:43.567 --> 36:46.949
- Yeah, you did so good, mama.
- Yeah.

36:46.984 --> 36:48.779
- There you go.
- So beautiful.

36:48.813 --> 36:50.677
Alright, darling.

36:53.784 --> 36:55.579
Dig this little dude.

37:24.055 --> 37:26.161
"And the fifth angel sounded

37:26.195 --> 37:29.302
"and I saw a star fall
from heaven unto the Earth.

37:29.337 --> 37:33.099
"And to him was given the key
of the bottomless pit.

37:33.133 --> 37:34.756
And he opened
the bottomless pit --"

37:34.790 --> 37:36.965
Do you know
about the bottomless pit?

37:36.999 --> 37:39.070
We're gonna find it.
Well, I'm gonna find it

37:39.105 --> 37:40.693
and we're gonna live in it.

37:40.727 --> 37:42.867
The question is your answer.
Keep reading.

37:45.180 --> 37:46.526
That's Charlie.

37:46.561 --> 37:48.597
Hey, Charlie.
Hey, listen, this is Kay.

37:48.632 --> 37:51.151
Well, how do you do?

37:52.360 --> 37:53.878
Welcome, ma'am.

37:56.156 --> 37:58.227
Oh, I see.

37:58.262 --> 38:00.540
You make a man ashamed
to show his pecker.

38:01.990 --> 38:04.233
That's what Eve did.

38:04.268 --> 38:06.166
Look where that got us.

38:11.206 --> 38:13.588
Do I make you uncomfortable,
little girl?

38:15.969 --> 38:17.799
No.

38:17.833 --> 38:19.318
You're just rude.

38:19.352 --> 38:21.285
Is that what daddy taught you,
to be polite?

38:22.735 --> 38:24.564
No. No, my daddy taught me

38:24.599 --> 38:26.186
not to take shit
from men like you.

38:26.221 --> 38:28.672
That's what he taught me.
- Keep reading.

38:29.880 --> 38:31.847
- Charlie, I --
- Go home to daddy, little girl.

38:31.882 --> 38:34.056
You don't belong here.

38:34.091 --> 38:35.299
Shoo.

38:37.474 --> 38:38.992
I'm sorry, Charlie.

38:42.513 --> 38:45.792
"And there came out of the smoke
locusts upon the Earth."

38:45.827 --> 38:48.623
Get her out of here so I don't
have to look at her piggie face.

38:52.109 --> 38:54.214
You see that, Lulu.

38:54.249 --> 38:56.424
Not every stupid hippie girl
can waltz onto my land

38:56.458 --> 38:59.081
and get a free dinner.

38:59.116 --> 39:01.049
I need to see something
in your eyes.

39:05.847 --> 39:07.158
Keep reading.

39:09.575 --> 39:12.474
"And there came out of the smoke locusts upon the Earth."

39:12.509 --> 39:13.855
The Beatles.

39:13.889 --> 39:15.581
"And unto them
was given power.."

39:15.615 --> 39:16.961
Me.

39:16.996 --> 39:18.411
"...as the scorpions
of the Earth have power."

39:18.446 --> 39:19.412
Me.

39:19.447 --> 39:20.827
"And it was commanded them

39:20.862 --> 39:23.278
"that they should not hurt
the grass of the Earth

39:23.312 --> 39:24.624
neither any green thing.."

39:57.588 --> 40:00.453
I have wings
and I can fly now.

40:03.145 --> 40:05.182
Charlie says
there's gonna be a revolution

40:05.216 --> 40:07.391
and we're gonna wait it out
in the bottomless pit.

40:07.426 --> 40:08.634
Like it says in Revelations.

40:08.668 --> 40:10.463
And that there will be babies
that are homeless

40:10.498 --> 40:13.432
and they need saving
from all the killings.

40:13.466 --> 40:16.055
And then we'll stay underground
and make music

40:16.089 --> 40:18.471
and make love
until the violence is over.

40:18.506 --> 40:20.162
And then -- and then
when it comes time for us

40:20.197 --> 40:22.164
to rise to the surface again,
some of us

40:22.199 --> 40:24.960
will begin to feel budding wings
on our backs.

40:24.995 --> 40:26.410
- Wings?
- Yes.

40:26.445 --> 40:28.412
Some of us want to become
winged elves.

40:29.586 --> 40:31.898
Me and Sandy, Squeaky.

40:31.933 --> 40:34.004
Charlie says it would happen.

40:36.075 --> 40:37.939
Karlene thinks we're crazy.

40:37.973 --> 40:41.149
No.
I would never use that word.

40:42.875 --> 40:46.499
I'm just surprised
to hear some of this stuff.

40:46.534 --> 40:49.019
You've to admit
it's pretty far out.

40:52.298 --> 40:55.439
You must know that elves

40:55.474 --> 40:57.855
are mythical creatures

40:57.890 --> 41:02.170
and therefore human beings
can't turn into elves

41:02.204 --> 41:03.551
or sprout wings?

41:07.278 --> 41:10.212
Well, hey, man, it's no more
far out than heaven and hell.

41:10.247 --> 41:12.767
- Yeah. Charlie says that --
- Yeah, but what do you think?

41:14.872 --> 41:16.943
Pat, do you still think
it's possible

41:16.978 --> 41:19.670
that you will become
a winged elf?

41:22.811 --> 41:25.883
Well, I guess not now.
Not -- not when we're in here.

41:27.678 --> 41:28.990
You won't become a winged elf

41:29.024 --> 41:31.475
whether you're in here
or out in the world.

41:42.900 --> 41:46.179
Karlene, tell us
about your kids.

41:46.214 --> 41:47.560
Pretty please?

41:47.595 --> 41:50.149
What are their names?
How old are they?

41:50.183 --> 41:52.427
We spend too much time
talking about us in here.

41:53.877 --> 41:58.053
They are 15, 14, 11 and 7.

41:59.227 --> 42:00.849
You have a 7-year-old?

42:00.884 --> 42:02.575
He must miss you so much.

42:02.610 --> 42:05.440
- I see him every weekend.
- I didn't mean it like that.

42:09.340 --> 42:12.654
I took my family
all around the world.

42:12.689 --> 42:16.693
To Germany, to France,
to Ethiopia.

42:16.727 --> 42:19.040
We've been through a lot
together

42:19.074 --> 42:21.905
and they are always
surprising me.

42:21.939 --> 42:24.114
Mom, I have a new family now.

42:24.148 --> 42:26.772
Leslie,
what are you talking about?

42:26.806 --> 42:29.498
We're your parents.

42:29.533 --> 42:32.087
Mom, please stop crying.

42:32.122 --> 42:35.435
Listen to me.
I need you to stop loving me.

42:35.470 --> 42:37.403
You're never gonna see me again.

42:41.200 --> 42:45.514

42:45.549 --> 42:47.068

42:47.102 --> 42:48.897
We were all way into our trips

42:48.932 --> 42:50.692
and hanging out inside the bus

42:50.727 --> 42:53.350
when Charlie just decides
he has to go.

42:53.384 --> 42:54.972
He starts running down the road

42:55.007 --> 42:57.457
we all start begging him
to come back to us.

42:57.492 --> 42:59.908
"Charlie! Charlie!"

43:01.392 --> 43:02.808
It was really scary.

43:02.842 --> 43:04.568
We can all laugh about it now.

43:04.603 --> 43:06.294
Right at that moment,
I was probably sitting

43:06.328 --> 43:08.089
in my secretarial school

43:08.123 --> 43:10.056
freaking out
but not even knowing it.

43:12.231 --> 43:14.233
We don't talk about our pasts.

43:15.268 --> 43:17.546
We don't have pasts.

43:17.581 --> 43:19.479
Our lives started
when we met Charlie.

43:19.514 --> 43:21.274
But Charlie talks
about his time in prison --

43:21.309 --> 43:23.552
How dare you question Charlie?

43:23.587 --> 43:25.796
You need to talk less
and listen more.

43:31.112 --> 43:32.907
- Dennis!
- Dennis!

43:37.290 --> 43:38.982
Hi.

Hey.

43:50.614 --> 43:53.203
Hey, beautiful.
Did you miss me?

43:54.238 --> 43:56.378
No, we've been busy.

43:56.413 --> 43:58.864
Lots going on here.
Charlie wants --

43:58.898 --> 44:01.383
Oh, Charlie, Charlie, Charlie.

44:01.418 --> 44:03.454
Let's talk about
what Greg wants.

44:03.489 --> 44:05.353
What does Greg want?

44:07.010 --> 44:09.322
Stand up girls, let's give
the guys what they want.

44:17.537 --> 44:19.747
You're all beautiful

44:19.781 --> 44:22.370
but right now, I just wanna
get high and play music, man.

44:22.404 --> 44:24.683
Come on then,
the girls are always here.

44:26.063 --> 44:27.824
Let's go play.

44:35.003 --> 44:37.972
I came to tell you something,
Charlie.

44:38.006 --> 44:40.906
I talked the band
into recording your song

44:40.940 --> 44:42.183
"Cease To Exist."

44:43.702 --> 44:46.497
- Everyone likes it, man.
- That's far out.

44:46.532 --> 44:48.741
Yeah. I can't promise
more than that though.

44:50.225 --> 44:52.158
We'll just see
how it works out.

Well, hey there.

45:18.909 --> 45:20.152
Looky, looky here.

45:21.498 --> 45:23.569
Where's that baby's daddy?

45:23.603 --> 45:26.330
We split. He went sailing
around the world or something.

45:26.365 --> 45:28.919
Take that baby to be with
the other little kiddies here.

45:31.957 --> 45:34.166
Tex tells me
that you have a car?

45:36.375 --> 45:38.308
Alright.
I think we can keep her.

45:39.412 --> 45:41.207
Let me show you around.

45:43.796 --> 45:46.247
Don't worry.
Ruth Ann is great with the kids.

45:46.281 --> 45:47.800
And just think,
if you're loyal to Charlie

45:47.835 --> 45:49.906
she will always
be taken care of.

45:49.940 --> 45:52.805
Here everything
belongs to everyone.

45:52.840 --> 45:55.463
Gypsy tells me you had a far-out
session making it with Tex.

45:55.497 --> 45:56.705
Yeah.

45:56.740 --> 45:58.880
When we came,
my -- my fists were clenched

45:58.915 --> 46:01.089
and my sides and arms
were paralyzed.

46:01.124 --> 46:02.919
That's your ego dying.

46:02.953 --> 46:05.266
Is that bad?
To have your ego dying?

46:05.300 --> 46:08.890
No. That's what Charlie's
trying to help us do.

46:08.925 --> 46:11.928
Kill our egos.
Be one consciousness.

46:16.104 --> 46:18.693
- Love you, sweetheart.
- Come on. Let's go.

46:40.646 --> 46:43.718
What -- what happened?
Is your mom okay?

46:45.478 --> 46:47.239
Oh, she's fine.

46:48.861 --> 46:50.000
Oh.

47:05.188 --> 47:07.707
I just can't stand it.

47:07.742 --> 47:09.295
She might think
I ended up in here

47:09.330 --> 47:12.229
because of something they did or the way that they raised me.

47:21.929 --> 47:24.828
No one has visited her
the whole three years.

47:26.761 --> 47:28.867
I told my mother
to stop loving me..

47:30.282 --> 47:32.249
...and she would never
see me again.

47:33.250 --> 47:35.183
She kept loving me, anyway.

47:45.331 --> 47:49.508
Now listen up. I want everyone
to show my good friend Phil here

47:49.542 --> 47:50.750
a lot of love tonight.

47:50.785 --> 47:52.097
He's my jailhouse brother.

47:52.131 --> 47:53.339
We were at San Quentin together.

47:53.374 --> 47:54.996
So Katie, Lulu,
why don't you come

47:55.031 --> 47:56.411
and make the man feel welcome?

47:56.446 --> 47:59.932
♪ I feel much better
on the other ♪

48:00.795 --> 48:02.555
♪ Side ♪

48:04.281 --> 48:06.663
Shit. Well, look at that.

48:08.872 --> 48:11.047
You know, we all thought
he was fucking crazy in prison.

48:11.081 --> 48:13.325
Talked a lot of nonsense, but..

48:14.222 --> 48:16.293
...maybe I should have listened.

48:16.328 --> 48:19.365
Now my good friend Dennis here

48:19.400 --> 48:21.643
has an announcement to make.

48:21.678 --> 48:24.370
Uh, yeah, Charlie's song

48:24.405 --> 48:27.477
"Cease To Exist"
is on the record.

48:37.866 --> 48:40.973
Now all you need to do is
get your friend Terry Melcher

48:41.008 --> 48:42.561
to come up here
and listen to me play

48:42.595 --> 48:43.976
and I know he'll wanna sign us.

48:44.011 --> 48:46.565
I'll do my best
to get him out here, man.

48:46.599 --> 48:48.015
Now that's right.

48:57.196 --> 48:58.784
Alright, man. Thanks.

49:01.580 --> 49:03.168
Now, Katie,
get everyone together.

49:03.202 --> 49:05.515
Tell them just stop what they're
doing right now and come here.

49:05.549 --> 49:07.448
- Okay.
- Soon. Now.

49:10.451 --> 49:12.971
Terry Melcher is coming
to hear me play.

49:13.005 --> 49:16.284
So we need to be ready. I mean,
we need to be more than ready.

49:16.319 --> 49:18.148
Terry Melcher.

49:18.183 --> 49:20.185
Terry Melcher!

49:20.219 --> 49:21.876
Come on.

49:21.910 --> 49:23.498
Dennis' producer,
the guy who can give me

49:23.533 --> 49:25.086
a record deal, goddamn it.

49:25.121 --> 49:26.329
Yeah.

49:26.363 --> 49:28.607
When Terry hears me play,
he's gonna lose his mind

49:28.641 --> 49:31.368
which means the world
gets to hear my music.

49:31.403 --> 49:33.992
And then all the lost
young loves during the mayhem

49:34.026 --> 49:35.545
and the killing
will hear my music

49:35.579 --> 49:37.547
and they will know that
they have a home.

49:37.581 --> 49:40.170
So, guys, make this place
look spotless.

49:40.205 --> 49:42.448
Get rid of all the stuff
that stinks.

49:42.483 --> 49:44.726
And, girls,
you bake some cookies.

49:44.761 --> 49:45.969
Go to the grocery store.

49:46.004 --> 49:48.903
I don't want no garbage run food
for Terry.

49:48.937 --> 49:51.975
And I want a deer skin shirt and
pants held together by laces.

49:52.010 --> 49:55.082
I want him to see my commitment
to going back to the land.

49:56.428 --> 49:58.637
But don't they have to kill
the deer for that?

50:09.199 --> 50:11.788
Lulu has a question. Would you
like to repeat that, Lulu?

50:15.033 --> 50:17.000
Don't they kill the deer --

50:17.035 --> 50:18.829
What we have here..

50:24.111 --> 50:27.286
...what we have here
is a contradiction.

50:27.321 --> 50:29.185
Lulu thinks
she sees a contradiction

50:29.219 --> 50:32.878
and her tiny female brain
is gonna have a freak out.

50:32.912 --> 50:36.675
If you think
I'm going against my own words

50:36.709 --> 50:38.677
then maybe you just aren't
evolved enough yet

50:38.711 --> 50:41.059
to understand what's going on.

50:43.889 --> 50:46.823
Old JC said a lot of things
his followers didn't understand

50:46.857 --> 50:49.446
and they stuck around.

Hey, Charlie, man,
let's take a walk.

55:34.110 --> 55:36.284

55:36.319 --> 55:37.838
Alright, man.

55:46.398 --> 55:48.642
You know, I mean, look,
we get off into these trees..

55:49.781 --> 55:51.714
...we go walking.

55:51.748 --> 55:53.923

you know.

55:55.476 --> 55:56.719
Yeah, so, uh..

55:56.753 --> 55:59.929
That was perfect.
So beautiful.

56:01.379 --> 56:05.624
You girls made me cry.
Your voices were so sweet.

56:05.659 --> 56:07.074

56:20.087 --> 56:22.020
He looks like
a rock star already.

56:34.895 --> 56:36.275
Well, man, what did he say?

56:36.310 --> 56:38.277
He looked like
he was really digging it.

56:38.312 --> 56:40.866
Is he gonna sign you
like he should?

56:40.901 --> 56:43.628
I mean, he gave me money.

56:43.662 --> 56:44.732
How much is it?

56:44.767 --> 56:46.458
I couldn't sign a contract
on the spot.

56:46.493 --> 56:48.391
That's just not how
Charlie Manson operates.

56:48.426 --> 56:51.049
My word is my bond. I don't need
no written contract.

56:52.844 --> 56:54.949
What about that money?

56:54.984 --> 56:56.675
Well, it's just hay money.

56:56.710 --> 56:58.746
I'm sure he wanted the horses
to eat well.

57:01.853 --> 57:03.026
You know, let's eat
some of the cookies

57:03.061 --> 57:04.511
those motherfuckers didn't want.

57:51.834 --> 57:53.767
Who made this salad dressing?

57:55.147 --> 57:56.252
I did.

57:58.737 --> 58:00.774
Well, smells a bit like piss.

58:03.708 --> 58:06.745
Well, that's 'cause
I pissed in yours.

and the powerful

1:02:54.999 --> 1:02:57.070
needin' a damn good whacking.
The "Blackbird."

1:02:57.104 --> 1:02:59.520
It's the black man's time
to rise.

1:02:59.555 --> 1:03:02.696
And "Revolution 1,"
it's a call to arms. It's time.

1:03:02.730 --> 1:03:05.147
"Revolution 9,"
it's the soundtrack to the war.

1:03:05.181 --> 1:03:07.045
It's guns. Screaming.

1:03:07.080 --> 1:03:08.495
Does that make you feel afraid?

1:03:08.529 --> 1:03:11.463
No. It's like you always said
it would be.

1:03:11.498 --> 1:03:13.465
You're damn straight it's like I always said it would be.

1:03:13.500 --> 1:03:15.122
You should feel proud.
You should all feel proud.

1:03:15.157 --> 1:03:17.297
And why should you all
feel proud? Lulu, why?

1:03:17.331 --> 1:03:19.161
Because we're already living
like revolutionaries.

1:03:19.195 --> 1:03:21.370
Yes! Now dig this.

1:03:21.404 --> 1:03:22.992
In Revelations, in the Bible

1:03:23.027 --> 1:03:24.822
it talks about the locusts
coming to Earth.

1:03:24.856 --> 1:03:26.064
Now that's the Beatles.

1:03:26.099 --> 1:03:27.894
And he talks about
the locusts having scales

1:03:27.928 --> 1:03:29.240
like iron breastplates.

1:03:29.274 --> 1:03:31.276
That's the Beatles' guitars.
And dig this.

1:03:31.311 --> 1:03:34.176
He talks about five angels
coming to Earth.

1:03:34.210 --> 1:03:36.385
Now this five angels,
four of them are the Beatles

1:03:36.419 --> 1:03:37.627
the other one is me.

1:03:37.662 --> 1:03:39.698
And the other one is me
because I am given the key

1:03:39.733 --> 1:03:41.459
to the shaft
of the bottomless pit.

1:03:41.493 --> 1:03:42.840
And where is
the bottomless pit?

1:03:42.874 --> 1:03:45.083
The one you told us about
in Death Valley?

1:03:45.118 --> 1:03:47.879
- The one we're going to find.
- Yes!

1:03:47.914 --> 1:03:50.709
So "Helter Skelter"
is the thing, man.

1:03:50.744 --> 1:03:52.919
It's what
the black man's gonna do

1:03:52.953 --> 1:03:54.852
to start the race war.

1:03:54.886 --> 1:03:56.163
But just like the Bible says

1:03:56.198 --> 1:03:58.890
I will lead my family
to the bottomless pit

1:03:58.925 --> 1:04:01.030
and we will live out the war
underground

1:04:01.065 --> 1:04:03.343
and we will expand to 144,000

1:04:03.377 --> 1:04:06.484
and then we will come back
like the 12 tribes of Israel.

1:04:06.518 --> 1:04:09.004
And when we come back,
the black man will not know

1:04:09.038 --> 1:04:11.006
how to act or how to be

1:04:11.040 --> 1:04:13.249
or how to govern
or what to do.

1:04:13.284 --> 1:04:16.080
And so, we cannot leave!

1:04:16.114 --> 1:04:18.151
We cannot leave
because you're white people

1:04:18.185 --> 1:04:19.324
and you will be murdered.

1:04:19.359 --> 1:04:20.878
You will be made
into black slaves.

1:04:20.912 --> 1:04:22.776
And Tex, Tex!

1:04:22.810 --> 1:04:25.123
Tex is gonna be sorry
that he ever left our tribe.

1:04:31.129 --> 1:04:33.062
- Thanks for coming out here.
- That's okay.

1:04:33.097 --> 1:04:35.064
Hey, look,
my wife just wants to know

1:04:35.099 --> 1:04:36.997
all about these
crazy Manson girls.

1:04:37.032 --> 1:04:38.757
Yeah.

1:04:38.792 --> 1:04:41.036
I get asked
about them a lot too.

1:04:41.070 --> 1:04:42.037
Yeah.

1:04:46.455 --> 1:04:49.182
Um, okay,
now you were all just kids

1:04:49.216 --> 1:04:52.840
when the Watts Riots happened,
but it's a perfect example.

1:04:52.875 --> 1:04:54.325
Here you have black Americans

1:04:54.359 --> 1:04:57.949
oppressed for generations,
at the end of their rope.

1:04:57.984 --> 1:04:59.537
You know, things got
out of hand back then

1:04:59.571 --> 1:05:01.332
but the message was sent.

1:05:01.366 --> 1:05:03.782
Yeah, Charlie said that
Watts was the beginning.

1:05:03.817 --> 1:05:05.543
I really think that
a race war would have started

1:05:05.577 --> 1:05:06.785
if they hadn't put us in here.

1:05:06.820 --> 1:05:10.341
The black man is rising up
and his time is coming.

1:05:10.375 --> 1:05:12.274
Do you think it's still coming?

1:05:13.551 --> 1:05:15.035
Um..

1:05:15.070 --> 1:05:18.866
Well, Bobby Seale was bound
and gagged in a courtroom

1:05:18.901 --> 1:05:20.972
but last year they let him go,
so..

1:05:23.837 --> 1:05:25.770
We don't know who that is.

1:05:29.463 --> 1:05:30.913
Black Panthers?

1:05:33.122 --> 1:05:34.744
Y'all don't get any news
in here at all?

1:05:34.779 --> 1:05:37.471
Oh, yes.
We know the Black Panthers.

1:05:37.506 --> 1:05:39.128
Charlie said that
black people wouldn't be able

1:05:39.163 --> 1:05:40.854
to lead themselves
after the revolution

1:05:40.888 --> 1:05:42.821
that they would need his help.

1:05:44.996 --> 1:05:46.791
Yeah, I heard that he said that.

1:05:46.825 --> 1:05:48.931
It's okay, he said
you wouldn't understand now

1:05:48.966 --> 1:05:51.037
but that you would thank him
later.

1:05:52.624 --> 1:05:53.591
But..

1:05:54.695 --> 1:05:56.352
You don't think that's true?

1:05:56.387 --> 1:05:59.631
I find that to be
a deeply racist idea.

1:05:59.666 --> 1:06:01.530
That black people would need
a white man

1:06:01.564 --> 1:06:03.635
to tell them what to think.

1:06:03.670 --> 1:06:05.189
When black people
take their power back

1:06:05.223 --> 1:06:06.500
there's no chance
in hell that --

1:06:06.535 --> 1:06:07.605
Charlie said --

1:06:07.639 --> 1:06:09.952
Let's listen to what
Bill has to say.

1:06:13.749 --> 1:06:16.096
There's no chance in hell
that we would turn

1:06:16.131 --> 1:06:19.065
to a white person
for leadership.

1:06:19.099 --> 1:06:23.138
And black people were
brought here as slaves in 1619.

1:06:23.172 --> 1:06:24.967
And even after slavery

1:06:25.002 --> 1:06:26.934
and the eventual abolishment
of slavery

1:06:26.969 --> 1:06:29.730
we are still
getting crushed by racism.

1:06:31.491 --> 1:06:33.838
We don't trust the white men

1:06:33.872 --> 1:06:36.358
and we certainly don't need one
to lead us.

1:06:36.392 --> 1:06:37.738
You hear me?

1:06:41.846 --> 1:06:43.020
The trouble with blackie is

1:06:43.054 --> 1:06:44.987
he wants to fuck
all the white women

1:06:45.022 --> 1:06:46.402
turn all the white babies
brown.

1:06:46.437 --> 1:06:49.440
We can't have that.
That's what makes whitey mad.

1:06:49.474 --> 1:06:51.062
Well, we're gonna
help blackie out.

1:06:51.097 --> 1:06:53.961
We're gonna start a race war
called Helter Skelter.

1:06:53.996 --> 1:06:56.033
And we start this war
by killing some white people

1:06:56.067 --> 1:06:58.069
and making it look like
the black man's work.

1:06:58.104 --> 1:07:01.038
Blackie's been waiting
for this. Blackie is waiting.

1:07:01.072 --> 1:07:03.005
And then the piggy cops
will come down on blackie

1:07:03.040 --> 1:07:04.731
when they find
the rich dead piggies.

1:07:04.765 --> 1:07:06.767
Then the revolution will begin.

1:07:06.802 --> 1:07:08.873
You understand me?

1:07:08.907 --> 1:07:11.151
Helter Skelter is upon us.

1:07:16.950 --> 1:07:18.262
Lulu, what's wrong?

1:07:19.918 --> 1:07:22.852
Did you ever start to think
that maybe Helter Skelter

1:07:22.887 --> 1:07:24.820
isn't coming down at all?

1:07:26.339 --> 1:07:28.099
That Charlie was wrong?

1:07:28.134 --> 1:07:29.894
No. No.

1:07:32.138 --> 1:07:35.072
Don't let this place
get to you.

1:07:35.106 --> 1:07:37.384
It would be happening right now if we weren't in here.

1:07:39.145 --> 1:07:40.594
Please don't give up now.

1:07:40.629 --> 1:07:42.734
- Okay.
- Please, I need you.

1:07:44.219 --> 1:07:46.531
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to upset you.

1:08:13.144 --> 1:08:15.629
Lulu, this knife might be
the only thing

1:08:15.664 --> 1:08:17.700
between you and blackie
slitting your throat.

1:08:17.735 --> 1:08:19.219
Thrust and jab
like you mean it.

1:08:19.254 --> 1:08:21.325
Thrust. Jab. Lift.

1:08:22.498 --> 1:08:23.948
Stab the chair.

1:08:31.714 --> 1:08:33.060
Good, Mary.

1:08:40.413 --> 1:08:43.001
I know everyone thinks
we're these scary creatures

1:08:43.036 --> 1:08:45.590
who committed
these horrible crimes

1:08:45.625 --> 1:08:49.836
but we were just engaging
in the dance of life and death.

1:08:49.870 --> 1:08:52.183
Charlie says there is no death.

1:08:52.218 --> 1:08:55.324
So you're saying it's okay
to take someone's life?

1:08:57.223 --> 1:08:59.466
Leslie, Susan,
is that what you think?

1:09:00.778 --> 1:09:01.710
No.

1:09:03.056 --> 1:09:05.092
I'm saying
that I'm starting to think

1:09:05.127 --> 1:09:08.889
that the devil took a hold of me
so I could find my way to God.

1:09:08.924 --> 1:09:10.891
So Charlie is the devil?

1:09:10.926 --> 1:09:14.067
No, Charlie is Charlie
and the devil is the devil.

1:09:17.657 --> 1:09:20.280
So you all still believe

1:09:20.315 --> 1:09:23.214
that thing he was talking about

1:09:23.249 --> 1:09:24.733
Helter Skelter?

1:09:32.568 --> 1:09:35.502
The other night, I started
to doubt it and I got shaky.

1:09:37.504 --> 1:09:40.576
You felt doubt.
What made you feel that doubt?

1:09:40.611 --> 1:09:42.578
That was just for a minute,
right, Lulu?

1:09:42.613 --> 1:09:44.201
She doesn't doubt anymore.

1:09:45.995 --> 1:09:48.619
Sorry to interrupt
your studies, ladies.

1:09:52.001 --> 1:09:54.625
I am afraid I have bad news.

1:09:54.659 --> 1:09:58.180
The decision has come down
and you will remain here in SSU

1:09:58.215 --> 1:10:00.355
for the duration
of your sentences.

1:10:02.771 --> 1:10:04.497
Fucking motherfuckers!

1:10:04.531 --> 1:10:07.327
They can't fucking
do this shit to us!

1:10:07.362 --> 1:10:09.156
We're fucking human beings!

1:10:09.191 --> 1:10:11.297
You are considered
an escape risk

1:10:11.331 --> 1:10:12.850
and too well known.

1:10:13.989 --> 1:10:15.542
No!

1:10:21.238 --> 1:10:23.895
I'm never gonna
see Charlie again.

1:10:26.898 --> 1:10:28.831
We don't know
what's gonna happen.

1:10:28.866 --> 1:10:30.350
There's always parole.
You could get out.

1:10:30.385 --> 1:10:33.284
No, you. You could get out.

1:10:33.319 --> 1:10:35.252
They'll never let me
out of here.

1:10:40.326 --> 1:10:42.397
It's my fault you're in here.

1:10:43.881 --> 1:10:46.435
Charlie said make sure everyone
does something that night

1:10:46.470 --> 1:10:48.403
and I made sure you did.

1:10:51.268 --> 1:10:52.855
You must hate me.

1:10:59.552 --> 1:11:01.554
I could never hate you.

1:11:25.267 --> 1:11:26.958
Good afternoon, ladies.

1:11:26.993 --> 1:11:28.857
Special treat for you today.

1:11:28.891 --> 1:11:30.341
No school.

1:11:30.376 --> 1:11:32.516
Just a mini concert.

1:11:32.550 --> 1:11:34.483
Ladies, I brought Robin
to play for you..

1:11:43.699 --> 1:11:45.770
Ladies, why would you do this?

1:11:47.013 --> 1:11:50.603
Charlie spoke to us last night.
He told us to.

1:11:50.637 --> 1:11:52.570
He told us to protest.

1:11:54.261 --> 1:11:56.367
Jesus fucking Christ.

1:11:58.231 --> 1:12:00.337
How the hell
did they get razors?

1:12:00.371 --> 1:12:01.476
The guards love them.

1:12:01.510 --> 1:12:04.341
They have all kinds of things
in their cells.

1:12:04.375 --> 1:12:05.652
Are you okay?

1:12:05.687 --> 1:12:08.724
It's just as long as
they're stuck alone together

1:12:08.759 --> 1:12:12.556
in that unit just repeating
their brainwashing
back to each other..

1:12:15.317 --> 1:12:17.250
I mean, they're never gonna see
the real world again

1:12:17.284 --> 1:12:19.839
so what is it
we can really do for them?

1:12:24.153 --> 1:12:26.259
I just wanna remind them

1:12:26.293 --> 1:12:27.640
if I can..

1:12:30.090 --> 1:12:33.439
...of who they were before
they ever met Charles Manson.

1:12:34.888 --> 1:12:37.615
I just wanna give them back
themselves.

1:12:52.147 --> 1:12:53.735
Let's go take a walk.

1:12:54.839 --> 1:12:56.807
Where's Charlie?

1:12:56.841 --> 1:12:58.636
He went somewhere with Paul.

1:12:58.671 --> 1:13:00.811
Seems like
he's been gone forever.

1:13:03.676 --> 1:13:06.299
- You like living here?
- Yeah. You should join us.

1:13:06.333 --> 1:13:08.163
- Nah, I need my freedom.
- Freedom?

1:13:08.197 --> 1:13:10.130
That's all we have here.

1:13:17.137 --> 1:13:18.345
I like you.

1:13:19.657 --> 1:13:21.659
You should come away
on adventures with me.

1:13:21.694 --> 1:13:24.179
I have a lot
of responsibilities here.

1:13:24.213 --> 1:13:26.146
We're preparing for a war.

1:13:27.078 --> 1:13:28.079
Well, if we're all gonna die

1:13:28.114 --> 1:13:29.840
we better get
to making love, huh?

1:13:29.874 --> 1:13:31.842
Well, I don't know about that.

1:13:31.876 --> 1:13:33.015
Come on.

1:13:33.050 --> 1:13:35.259
You might be my last chance,
baby.

1:13:45.096 --> 1:13:47.202
Hey. Who the fuck are you?

1:13:51.482 --> 1:13:52.897
Sorry, man. I came..

1:13:52.932 --> 1:13:55.693
I came with Danny and them guys.

1:13:55.728 --> 1:13:57.488
- I thought you --
- Get the fuck out of here.

1:13:57.523 --> 1:13:59.076
And don't you come back
unless you're invited

1:13:59.110 --> 1:14:00.387
which you wont be.

1:14:00.422 --> 1:14:02.700
Get up. Get out.

1:14:02.735 --> 1:14:04.495
You want me to help
get your dick in your pants?

1:14:04.530 --> 1:14:06.463
Get the fuck out of my barn!

1:14:08.672 --> 1:14:11.053
You guys got a weird scene
going on up here, man.

1:14:14.160 --> 1:14:16.058
You ask me first!

1:14:18.164 --> 1:14:20.269
You don't just whore around.

1:14:21.339 --> 1:14:23.100
That is it.

1:14:23.134 --> 1:14:25.965
No more hippie kids looking
for a free ride and a quick lay.

1:14:25.999 --> 1:14:28.761
Nobody has any visitors
unless it goes through me.

1:14:28.795 --> 1:14:31.453
We need to stay focused
on our scene.

1:14:31.488 --> 1:14:33.041
No more outsiders.

1:14:52.854 --> 1:14:55.132
I'm gonna go on an adventure.

1:14:57.030 --> 1:14:59.136
You can come.

1:14:59.170 --> 1:15:00.344
Bring Lulu.

1:15:02.484 --> 1:15:05.694
Bring that Linda girl.
We'll use her car.

1:15:05.729 --> 1:15:07.316
We get
in the rich people's houses

1:15:07.351 --> 1:15:10.216
and we get in their heads,
you dig?

1:15:10.250 --> 1:15:13.460
You just, you get in
and get out. Don't be afraid.

1:15:13.495 --> 1:15:15.911
Mess things up a bit,
but don't break anything.

1:15:15.946 --> 1:15:17.499
Alright, take a wallet
here and there

1:15:17.534 --> 1:15:20.019
but mostly just let them know
that they're not safe.

1:15:20.053 --> 1:15:21.883
But what if they wake up?

1:15:21.917 --> 1:15:24.989
Don't allow them to. Use your
training, man. Be invisible.

1:16:39.546 --> 1:16:42.584
He'll wake up and say, "Honey,
where did I put my wallet?"

1:16:44.034 --> 1:16:47.140
And he'll say, "Why did you put
the portraits upside down?"

1:16:49.246 --> 1:16:50.834
What's in the wallet?

1:16:52.352 --> 1:16:55.839
Uh, uh, sixty bucks
and three credit cards.

1:16:55.873 --> 1:16:58.013
Well, that's nothing.
Next time we tie some piggies up

1:16:58.048 --> 1:16:59.981
and we scare them to death.

1:17:25.075 --> 1:17:29.148
Lulu, I think
you should leave here.

1:17:29.182 --> 1:17:31.115
I came to help you do that.

1:17:34.429 --> 1:17:37.708
It looks like you're being made
to stay here against your will.

1:17:37.743 --> 1:17:39.814
I can take you right now.

1:17:39.848 --> 1:17:42.471
You can drop that broom, get on
my bike and we'll be gone.

1:17:44.266 --> 1:17:46.199
Nobody will stop us.

1:18:07.117 --> 1:18:08.152
No.

1:18:10.672 --> 1:18:12.847
I'm staying here.

1:18:12.881 --> 1:18:15.470
I want to be here. I-I mean..

1:18:15.504 --> 1:18:16.920
Thank -- thank you.

1:18:21.787 --> 1:18:23.927
Are you sure about this?

1:18:23.961 --> 1:18:26.584
I ain't expecting nothing
from you.

1:18:26.619 --> 1:18:27.654
I mean,
we -- we ain't gotta ball

1:18:27.689 --> 1:18:29.933
just 'cause I get you
out of here.

1:18:29.967 --> 1:18:32.349
You just look like you need
rescuing, that's all.

1:18:39.218 --> 1:18:40.529
I'm sure.

1:18:51.989 --> 1:18:53.197
Let's go.

1:19:35.619 --> 1:19:37.828
You wanna leave me?

1:19:37.863 --> 1:19:38.864
Jump.

1:19:57.675 --> 1:20:00.264
That's my Lulu.

1:20:00.299 --> 1:20:02.404
I knew you weren't going
anywhere.

1:20:35.886 --> 1:20:37.025
Hi.

1:20:39.269 --> 1:20:40.615
How are you?

1:20:43.100 --> 1:20:45.585
I've realized

1:20:45.620 --> 1:20:49.555
if I succeed in making them
really accept what they did..

1:20:51.626 --> 1:20:53.973
...then they will have to live
with that horror.

1:20:55.699 --> 1:20:58.426
Isn't that what prison's for?

1:20:58.460 --> 1:21:00.255
Atonement?

1:21:00.290 --> 1:21:02.775
Taking responsibility
for one's actions?

1:21:05.640 --> 1:21:08.712
They will have to live
with that horror every day

1:21:08.746 --> 1:21:10.541
for the rest of their lives.

1:21:11.784 --> 1:21:14.856
I'm opening the door
to that torment.

1:21:16.685 --> 1:21:19.757
To the place where
their punishment truly begins.

1:21:24.141 --> 1:21:26.557
- I like the 9-11.
- Yeah, me too.

1:21:26.592 --> 1:21:29.353
I like the little guy though.

1:21:29.388 --> 1:21:31.045
That's, uh, that's personal.

1:21:32.115 --> 1:21:33.254
Personal?

1:21:56.035 --> 1:21:58.555
I mean, it was just like
you said it'd be out there.

1:21:59.970 --> 1:22:02.731
Plastic people everywhere.

1:22:02.766 --> 1:22:04.906
But I belong here with you.

1:22:07.702 --> 1:22:09.669
Well, then get ready to fight.

1:22:18.092 --> 1:22:20.611
Now we put the piggy
in the chair.

1:22:20.646 --> 1:22:22.372
- Who's the piggy?
- Who's the piggy?

1:22:22.406 --> 1:22:24.063
- Who's the piggy?
- Who's the piggy?

1:22:24.098 --> 1:22:25.789
- Who's the piggy?
- Who's the piggy?

1:22:25.823 --> 1:22:26.997
- Who's the piggy?
- Who's the piggy?

1:22:27.032 --> 1:22:28.343
- Who's the piggy?
- Who's the piggy?

1:22:28.378 --> 1:22:29.758
- Who's the piggy?
- Who's the piggy?

1:22:29.793 --> 1:22:31.105
- Who's the piggy?
- Who's the piggy?

1:22:31.139 --> 1:22:32.485
- Who's the piggy?
- Who's the piggy?

1:22:32.520 --> 1:22:34.004
- Who's the piggy?
- Who's the piggy?

1:22:34.039 --> 1:22:35.316
- Kill the piggy.
- Kill the piggy!

1:22:35.350 --> 1:22:36.834
- Kill the piggy.
- Kill the piggy!

1:22:36.869 --> 1:22:38.181
- Kill the piggy.
- Kill the piggy!

1:22:38.215 --> 1:22:40.459
Now imagine we just yanked
this piggy out of his car.

1:22:40.493 --> 1:22:42.426
I want you to look at him and I want you to stare at him

1:22:42.461 --> 1:22:44.428
and I want you to scare him
to death!

1:22:48.053 --> 1:22:49.986
Now we could tie him up
and we could scare the piggy

1:22:50.020 --> 1:22:51.228
into willing us
all of his money.

1:22:51.263 --> 1:22:52.954
We could kill his family
in front of him

1:22:52.989 --> 1:22:54.887
but I need you
to give this gift to me.

1:22:54.921 --> 1:22:57.924
Are you willing
to die for me, Tex?

1:22:57.959 --> 1:23:00.306
Are you willing
to let me kill you?

1:23:00.341 --> 1:23:02.481
Yeah, Charlie.

1:23:02.515 --> 1:23:05.035
Charlie, you can kill me.

1:23:05.070 --> 1:23:07.486
You can kill me. I'm ready.

1:23:10.040 --> 1:23:11.973
I'm ready.

1:23:12.008 --> 1:23:13.940
We put the piggy in the chair.

1:23:24.020 --> 1:23:25.711
You can kill me, Charlie.

1:23:25.745 --> 1:23:27.368
- I can kill you.
- You can kill me.

1:23:27.402 --> 1:23:29.059
- We can kill you.
- You can kill me.

1:23:29.094 --> 1:23:30.647
- We can kill you.
- You can kill me.

1:23:30.681 --> 1:23:32.131
- We can kill you.
- You can kill me.

1:23:32.166 --> 1:23:33.719
- We can kill you.
- You can kill me.

1:23:33.753 --> 1:23:35.065
- We can kill you.
- You can kill me.

1:23:35.100 --> 1:23:36.653
- We can kill you.
- You can kill me!

1:23:36.687 --> 1:23:38.068
- We can kill you.
- You can kill me!

1:23:38.103 --> 1:23:39.966
- We can kill you!
- You can kill me!

1:23:40.001 --> 1:23:41.209
- We can kill you!
- You can kill me!

1:23:41.244 --> 1:23:42.797
- We can kill you!
- You can kill me!

1:23:48.423 --> 1:23:50.046
Tex Watson's gone.

1:23:51.806 --> 1:23:53.359
He doesn't exist anymore.

1:23:55.327 --> 1:23:57.053
Now there's just this.

1:23:58.951 --> 1:24:01.333
A body named Tex

1:24:01.367 --> 1:24:03.542
that carries around
a little piece of Charlie.

1:24:05.440 --> 1:24:07.373
A little piece of the infinite.

1:24:15.001 --> 1:24:17.073
It's Charlie Manson, baby.

1:24:17.107 --> 1:24:18.384
Yeah, for Terry.

1:24:19.903 --> 1:24:22.802
Yeah, well, I can call back,
but..

1:24:22.837 --> 1:24:24.908
Yeah, man, I dig.
That's cool. I can call back.

1:24:24.942 --> 1:24:26.427
That's no problem. Alright.

1:24:35.229 --> 1:24:36.437
You think I don't know
you're there, Terry?

1:24:36.471 --> 1:24:37.438
You think I don't know
you're there?

1:24:37.472 --> 1:24:38.680
I'll burn your fucking eyes out

1:24:38.715 --> 1:24:39.681
with this fucking cigarette.

1:24:39.716 --> 1:24:41.304
You fucking weasel fuck.

1:25:11.575 --> 1:25:13.059
Oh.

1:25:13.094 --> 1:25:15.476
Hello. Welcome. Do I know you?

1:25:15.510 --> 1:25:18.410
Uh, no, no,
I'm just looking for Terry.

1:25:18.444 --> 1:25:20.860
Terry Melcher.
I've been to a few parties here.

1:25:20.895 --> 1:25:23.277
- Hey, have I met you before?
- No.

1:25:23.311 --> 1:25:24.416
Well, um..

1:25:25.727 --> 1:25:28.765
...Terry moved to Malibu,
so he's not here.

1:25:28.799 --> 1:25:31.285
But are you a friend of Terry's?

1:25:32.665 --> 1:25:34.874
- Please come in if you want.
- No, no, thank you.

1:25:42.572 --> 1:25:44.953
Okay. Goodnight.

1:25:44.988 --> 1:25:46.092
Goodnight.

1:26:00.106 --> 1:26:01.832
- Thank you.
- Well, of course.

1:26:01.867 --> 1:26:04.421
...world-famous director
Roman Polanski.

1:26:04.456 --> 1:26:07.010
Beautiful Sharon Tate
had no way of knowing

1:26:07.044 --> 1:26:09.461
the horrific tragedy
that would soon befall her.

1:26:09.495 --> 1:26:11.808
I can feel very alone
at a party

1:26:11.842 --> 1:26:13.948
on the set or in general

1:26:13.982 --> 1:26:16.606
if I'm not in harmony
with the things around me.

1:26:16.640 --> 1:26:19.747
I'm very sensitive
to ugly situations.

1:26:19.781 --> 1:26:21.058
I'm quick to read people

1:26:21.093 --> 1:26:23.682
and I pick up
if someone's reacting to me

1:26:23.716 --> 1:26:25.856
as just a sexy blond.

1:26:25.891 --> 1:26:27.306
Times like those, I freeze.

1:26:27.341 --> 1:26:28.652
Lord Jesus..

1:26:28.687 --> 1:26:30.378
Who would you like to be
in your next life?

1:26:30.413 --> 1:26:32.484
I open up the door to my heart.

1:26:33.726 --> 1:26:36.108
Please come in
and forgive my sins.

1:26:38.386 --> 1:26:39.560
No!

1:26:41.044 --> 1:26:42.218
Dig.

1:26:44.875 --> 1:26:46.981
The time is now, man.
Helter Skelter.

1:26:47.015 --> 1:26:48.534
You go into Terry Melcher's
old house

1:26:48.569 --> 1:26:50.881
and you make it look like
blackie's work.

1:26:59.580 --> 1:27:01.547
Couple of weeks ago, me and Mary went on an acid run

1:27:01.582 --> 1:27:03.998
in Hollywood, you know.

1:27:04.032 --> 1:27:06.794
Even though they gave us this,
this really special stuff

1:27:06.828 --> 1:27:08.830
called Orange Sunshine.

1:27:08.865 --> 1:27:10.349
And when we got outside

1:27:10.384 --> 1:27:12.386
we were convinced
that we were invisible.

1:27:13.801 --> 1:27:17.218
Yeah. So we hitched a ride
over the Canyon, right

1:27:17.253 --> 1:27:19.462
and the driver, all of a sudden,
he just jerks around

1:27:19.496 --> 1:27:21.222
and he starts screaming
at us, you know, like

1:27:21.257 --> 1:27:23.811
"Who are you? What the fuck
are you doing to my car?"

1:27:23.845 --> 1:27:26.331
So we realized

1:27:26.365 --> 1:27:28.850
that we actually were invisible

1:27:28.885 --> 1:27:31.508
and what Charlie said was true.

1:27:31.543 --> 1:27:33.717
Once you burn every thought
out of your head..

1:27:35.512 --> 1:27:38.481
...there's nothing left
for anyone else to see.

1:27:38.515 --> 1:27:41.277
So we were staring
into the setting sun..

1:27:42.312 --> 1:27:44.452
...and..

1:27:44.487 --> 1:27:46.420
...it felt like we were looking
right at God.

1:27:47.628 --> 1:27:49.077
And I realized..

1:27:50.562 --> 1:27:52.564
...I realized that the closer
the sun got to setting

1:27:52.598 --> 1:27:56.015
the closer I knew
the end of the world was.

1:27:56.050 --> 1:27:58.190
What Charlie said was true.

1:27:58.224 --> 1:28:00.951
The apocalypse is at hand
and the present world is dying.

1:28:02.643 --> 1:28:06.198
From then on, I haven't had
a trace of doubt in my mind.

1:28:06.232 --> 1:28:08.511
It's coming down
and it's coming down fast.

1:28:33.777 --> 1:28:35.261
Please.

1:28:35.296 --> 1:28:37.609
Please, just take me with you.

1:28:37.643 --> 1:28:40.370
Please just let me live
to have my baby.

1:28:45.617 --> 1:28:46.825
Please.

1:28:52.451 --> 1:28:53.694
Kill her.

1:28:59.216 --> 1:29:00.459
No, no, no.

1:29:01.909 --> 1:29:04.739
Adorned with bright,
shiny things

1:29:04.774 --> 1:29:08.709
I see that as something
totally pure and beautiful.

1:29:08.743 --> 1:29:10.435
And what do you make
of some of the dark subjects

1:29:10.469 --> 1:29:11.643
in your husband's films?

1:29:11.677 --> 1:29:13.541
Everything that's realistic

1:29:13.576 --> 1:29:15.854
has some sort
of ugliness in it.

1:29:15.888 --> 1:29:18.477
Even a flower is ugly
when it wilts..

1:29:18.512 --> 1:29:21.135
Sadie, can you, please,
turn it down?

1:29:21.169 --> 1:29:23.689
The ocean
when it becomes violent.

1:29:26.347 --> 1:29:28.901
Was informative

1:29:28.936 --> 1:29:30.455
interesting

1:29:30.489 --> 1:29:32.940
but so graphic.

1:29:32.974 --> 1:29:35.287
I saw Lulu blushing
when she was reading it.

1:29:35.321 --> 1:29:36.530
I wasn't.

1:29:38.290 --> 1:29:39.567
Karlene, don't take this
the wrong way

1:29:39.602 --> 1:29:41.983
but are you a lesbian?

1:29:42.018 --> 1:29:44.054
This seems kind of like
a lesbian book.

1:29:45.262 --> 1:29:47.230
No, I'm not, Susan.

1:29:47.264 --> 1:29:49.819
Oh. I'm sorry.

1:29:50.992 --> 1:29:52.028
And glad.

1:29:53.478 --> 1:29:56.584
It's against the Lord's way
and I would worry for you.

1:29:56.619 --> 1:29:59.829
Well, we will have to agree
to disagree there.

1:30:02.176 --> 1:30:04.696
You can tell us if you are.

1:30:04.730 --> 1:30:07.664
I won't pass judgment on you.

1:30:07.699 --> 1:30:10.564
It's just that
you dress that way

1:30:10.598 --> 1:30:12.911
and you never talk
about your husband, so..

1:30:14.671 --> 1:30:16.846
My husband and I split up
a year ago.

1:30:18.744 --> 1:30:22.299
I don't like...talking
about him much.

1:30:22.334 --> 1:30:23.473
He's not a good man.

1:30:23.508 --> 1:30:24.854
I never saw you as someone

1:30:24.888 --> 1:30:27.028
who would be with a bad man.

1:30:29.583 --> 1:30:32.827
There are a lot of things
about all of you

1:30:32.862 --> 1:30:35.451
that I would never guess
from looking at you.

1:30:37.349 --> 1:30:40.076
Like, did you really believe

1:30:40.110 --> 1:30:43.976
that you were going to find
an underground cave

1:30:44.011 --> 1:30:46.634
and live that way
during the revolution?

1:30:48.774 --> 1:30:52.398
So much of what you've told me
doesn't make logical sense.

1:30:53.779 --> 1:30:55.919
How would you survive in a cave?

1:31:02.478 --> 1:31:05.101
We wanted to believe
something big was gonna happen.

1:31:07.690 --> 1:31:08.794
I mean..

1:31:11.314 --> 1:31:14.317
Do you remember in 1969..

1:31:15.836 --> 1:31:18.183
...it really felt like
there was gonna be

1:31:18.217 --> 1:31:21.255
a huge cosmic shift

1:31:21.289 --> 1:31:23.499
and things were never
gonna be the same?

1:31:25.949 --> 1:31:28.883
Like there was
gonna be some big thing

1:31:28.918 --> 1:31:30.885
that was gonna
change everything?

1:31:32.059 --> 1:31:33.819
Come on, Karlene..

1:31:35.027 --> 1:31:36.615
...you were there.

1:31:37.720 --> 1:31:39.687
Didn't it feel that way to you?

1:31:40.550 --> 1:31:41.965
Yeah, it did.

1:31:44.416 --> 1:31:47.005
It felt that way
to most people I know.

1:31:49.801 --> 1:31:52.286
But it didn't make them
kill strangers.

1:31:54.426 --> 1:31:55.979
But we had to.

1:31:59.293 --> 1:32:00.915
It was for..

1:32:02.538 --> 1:32:03.780
For what?

1:32:05.748 --> 1:32:07.543
What was it for?

1:32:18.623 --> 1:32:19.831
My hand hurts.

1:32:23.213 --> 1:32:25.526
The -- the knife didn't have
a proper handle

1:32:25.561 --> 1:32:27.597
and it just kept hitting
the bone.

1:32:30.566 --> 1:32:34.155
So it's all going down
like Charlie said?

1:32:36.468 --> 1:32:37.469
Yeah..

1:32:39.264 --> 1:32:40.506
It's pretty heavy.

1:32:41.784 --> 1:32:43.855
But -- but it's like
Charlie said.

1:32:43.889 --> 1:32:47.375
"If you love everything

1:32:47.410 --> 1:32:51.069
then you don't have to think
about things." Right?

1:32:52.346 --> 1:32:54.520
- Right on.
- Okay.

1:32:58.386 --> 1:33:02.045
- What was it like?
- The people were very young.

1:33:04.220 --> 1:33:05.980
It didn't seem right.

1:33:09.777 --> 1:33:11.434
But it was the right thing
to do.

1:33:13.781 --> 1:33:16.094
Charlie asked me to do it
and I did it.

1:33:17.302 --> 1:33:20.029
No ego. No trip.

1:33:20.063 --> 1:33:21.996
Charlie taught us that death
and life are the same thing

1:33:22.031 --> 1:33:24.585
so there's nothing
to be afraid of.

1:33:24.620 --> 1:33:26.691
You can't be afraid
if you don't exist.

1:33:31.454 --> 1:33:32.489
Yeah.

1:33:54.235 --> 1:33:57.169
Honey, can you rub my feet

1:33:57.204 --> 1:33:58.688
just for a minute?

1:33:58.723 --> 1:34:00.656
It's always just for a minute.

1:34:03.797 --> 1:34:05.902
That will be Cory letting us
know she got in okay.

1:34:17.811 --> 1:34:18.950
Get up.

1:34:21.746 --> 1:34:23.679
Stand over here.
Last night was too messy.

1:34:23.713 --> 1:34:26.716
Tonight we're gonna go out
and we're gonna get it right.

1:34:26.751 --> 1:34:27.890
Uh-huh?

1:34:32.757 --> 1:34:34.206
I wanna go.

1:34:37.934 --> 1:34:40.143
You come along then.

1:35:04.271 --> 1:35:05.375
Well..

1:35:09.207 --> 1:35:11.105
...there's two people in there.

1:35:11.934 --> 1:35:13.901
I got them ready for ya.

1:35:15.247 --> 1:35:17.353
They're calm.
Don't freak them out.

1:35:19.665 --> 1:35:21.253
Do something witchy.

1:35:23.980 --> 1:35:25.913
And find your own way home.

1:35:40.307 --> 1:35:41.826
What are you gonna do?

1:35:41.860 --> 1:35:44.207
You're gonna kill us,
aren't you?

1:35:44.242 --> 1:35:47.072
Did he say to kill them?
- You're gonna kill us.

1:35:54.079 --> 1:35:55.805
Please, don't do this.

1:35:55.840 --> 1:35:57.117
Where's my wife?

1:35:57.151 --> 1:35:58.877
I have a chest full of money
at the store.

1:35:58.912 --> 1:36:02.087
Please. No! No! No! No! No!

1:36:02.122 --> 1:36:05.056
No! Come on. Rosemary! Rosemary!

1:36:05.090 --> 1:36:06.712
No! No! I got money!

1:36:06.747 --> 1:36:09.198
I got money!
I got money! I got money!

1:36:17.206 --> 1:36:18.897
What are you doing?

1:36:20.588 --> 1:36:22.452
Go take care of her.

1:36:22.487 --> 1:36:23.557
Go!

1:36:31.289 --> 1:36:33.291
Get away from me!

1:36:38.503 --> 1:36:40.781
Get away! Get away!

1:36:52.137 --> 1:36:54.139
Somebody help us!

1:36:54.174 --> 1:36:55.865
Somebody help!

1:36:55.900 --> 1:36:58.040
No! No! No! No!

1:36:58.074 --> 1:37:00.249
No! No! No! No!

1:37:04.632 --> 1:37:05.841
No!

1:37:28.070 --> 1:37:29.588
Get away!

1:37:29.623 --> 1:37:30.589
Tex!

1:37:30.624 --> 1:37:32.108
No! No!

1:37:32.143 --> 1:37:33.661
Tex!

1:38:09.180 --> 1:38:11.113
Come on now, Lulu.

1:38:18.914 --> 1:38:21.364
Charlie says
everyone has to do something.

1:39:08.342 --> 1:39:10.482
It was all for nothing.

1:39:23.392 --> 1:39:26.153
We did those horrible things
for nothing.

1:39:26.188 --> 1:39:28.328
Lulu, we did what we had to do.

1:39:30.468 --> 1:39:32.711
Call me Leslie now, please.

1:39:36.163 --> 1:39:37.993
My name is Leslie.

1:39:44.033 --> 1:39:46.104
We didn't have to do any of it.

1:39:49.280 --> 1:39:50.833
But we did.

1:39:55.527 --> 1:39:56.977
And why?

1:40:03.466 --> 1:40:06.400
Do you know why, Katie?

1:40:09.783 --> 1:40:10.887
Sadie?

1:40:12.820 --> 1:40:14.753
Why did we do those things?

1:40:23.038 --> 1:40:25.074
Jimmy?

1:40:25.109 --> 1:40:27.111
Jimmy, can I get out, please?
