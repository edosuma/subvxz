WEBVTT

00:01.342 --> 00:03.299
You promised I'd be back by now.

00:03.386 --> 00:05.212
Don't get your thong in a knot.

00:05.304 --> 00:06.715
Yeah, well, if my old man finds out

00:06.806 --> 00:08.882
that I've been biking with you,
he'll kill us both.

00:08.975 --> 00:11.892
Oh, yeah? Well, if your old man
was a man, I might be worried.

00:11.978 --> 00:14.551
Wayne, you've gotta get me back.
I'm serious.

00:15.356 --> 00:16.850
I'll get you a ride.

00:20.069 --> 00:21.896
What if he doesn't stop?

00:22.238 --> 00:23.352
He'll stop.

00:23.823 --> 00:26.444
Hey, stop!

00:33.791 --> 00:35.618
You stupid bastard!

00:36.043 --> 00:40.123
When I get through with you,
you're gonna wish you were dead.

00:43.841 --> 00:45.171
He's dead.

01:26.052 --> 01:29.836
Massive internal bleeding
in the abdominal cavity, Gerald.

01:29.930 --> 01:31.306
No, that's enough.

01:33.100 --> 01:36.386
My young friend,
you must have been in acute pain

01:36.479 --> 01:37.937
for many hours.

01:38.314 --> 01:40.805
What kept you from seeking help,
I wonder?

01:42.109 --> 01:45.478
Well, run the gut for me,
would you please, Gerald?

01:45.571 --> 01:46.816
Not a problem.

01:47.323 --> 01:49.232
There was definitely a blockage.

01:50.159 --> 01:54.453
It's strange, though. It seems to consist
of a cluster of objects.

01:54.538 --> 01:56.448
- Gallstones?
- Oh, my, no.

01:56.540 --> 02:00.159
Gallstones that large could never
pass through the cystic duct.

02:00.252 --> 02:01.332
And even if they did,

02:01.420 --> 02:04.623
they wouldn't
all be expelled at the same time.

02:04.840 --> 02:09.003
Although I did find a gallbladder once
with almost a kilo of large stones.

02:09.095 --> 02:11.383
Of course,
the victim was a sumo wrestler

02:11.472 --> 02:13.465
who weighed over 200 kilos.

02:13.557 --> 02:16.227
He was in the middle
of a bout, he just went...

02:17.520 --> 02:19.014
They're stones, Doc.

02:19.772 --> 02:21.231
Not gallstones.

02:24.902 --> 02:26.182
Emeralds.

02:26.487 --> 02:28.895
It was lodged
in his gastrointestinal tract,

02:28.989 --> 02:32.358
causing perforation of the peritoneum,

02:32.451 --> 02:35.238
internal bleeding, infection, and death.

02:35.496 --> 02:38.069
- He swallowed emeralds.
- He did indeed.

02:40.209 --> 02:42.534
I'm gonna take a wild guess here, Doc.

02:43.713 --> 02:46.583
He smuggled them into the country.

02:46.674 --> 02:49.212
It's from where
he smuggled them in, Jethro.

02:49.301 --> 02:52.920
Our sailor just arrived
from Guantanamo Bay, Cuba,

02:53.013 --> 02:54.721
where he was a translator.

02:56.308 --> 02:59.262
Petty Officer Second Class,
Khalil Sa'id.

02:59.353 --> 03:01.642
Naturalised American citizen,
born in Egypt.

03:01.731 --> 03:03.889
Worked as a translator at Camp Delta.

03:03.983 --> 03:06.770
Fluent in Arabic, Uyghur and Pashto.

03:06.861 --> 03:09.980
Died in his car
on Route 522, near Fredericksburg.

03:10.072 --> 03:11.566
Almost killed a pair of bikers.

03:11.657 --> 03:13.400
"Vroom-vroom" bikers or pedal bikers?

03:13.492 --> 03:15.485
I said bikers, Tony. Not cyclists.

03:15.578 --> 03:17.305
Bikers is a term
that refers to both cyclists...

03:17.329 --> 03:18.361
Next of kin?

03:18.456 --> 03:20.994
None in the states.
No US address either.

03:21.083 --> 03:23.206
And apparently,
he rotated from our naval station

03:23.294 --> 03:25.749
in Bahrain to Gitmo five months ago.

03:26.046 --> 03:27.754
Where'd he get those emeralds?

03:27.840 --> 03:29.334
Gitmo exchange?

03:29.759 --> 03:30.838
Sorry.

03:32.303 --> 03:34.628
Get your gear. We're going to Gitmo.

03:34.722 --> 03:36.631
That's a good one, boss.

03:37.349 --> 03:38.808
He was kidding, right?

03:38.893 --> 03:40.268
I don't think so.

03:41.312 --> 03:43.304
We're going to Cuba!

03:48.694 --> 03:50.069
Hey, Gibbs.

03:50.154 --> 03:52.561
I've got a gemologist
coming over to look at the rocks.

03:52.656 --> 03:54.483
It's my mother's friend's sister's son.

03:54.575 --> 03:55.719
Yeah, does he know his stuff?

03:55.743 --> 03:58.198
I went out with him, like, once,
and didn't get very far.

04:00.414 --> 04:02.039
Is this all from the car?

04:02.124 --> 04:03.702
Yeah. It was a rental.

04:04.627 --> 04:07.034
- Any classified material?
- Not in the suitcases.

04:07.129 --> 04:09.667
He would've swapped
his hard drive before he left.

04:09.757 --> 04:11.334
Well, check it anyway.

04:12.510 --> 04:14.336
These were in the suitcase.

04:14.762 --> 04:17.798
Stamped, no postmark.
All the same return address.

04:17.890 --> 04:20.761
"NCIS Special Agent Paula Cassidy."

04:20.851 --> 04:21.882
You know her?

04:21.976 --> 04:23.685
No. But I will.

04:23.771 --> 04:25.431
Okay, smell this.

04:28.692 --> 04:30.151
Does this turn you on, Abby?

04:30.236 --> 04:31.564
It turned somebody on.

04:31.654 --> 04:33.231
Box of condoms, half empty.

04:33.322 --> 04:35.778
The price tag
says they're from the Gitmo exchange.

04:35.866 --> 04:38.737
Hey, maybe...
Maybe it was a package deal.

04:38.828 --> 04:40.322
See if you can brand the cologne.

04:40.412 --> 04:41.788
Why? You want some?

04:41.872 --> 04:43.117
Nope, don't use cologne.

04:43.207 --> 04:45.365
Women I date think
the smell of sawdust is sexy.

04:45.459 --> 04:47.701
That's probably why
I don't date many women.

04:53.676 --> 04:54.874
Sorry.

04:55.636 --> 04:58.127
You had better have
a good reason for spilling my coffee.

04:58.222 --> 04:59.385
I do.

04:59.473 --> 05:01.929
I booked us on the first
AMC flight to Gitmo tomorrow.

05:02.017 --> 05:03.298
Unbook it.

05:03.394 --> 05:04.769
I knew it.

05:04.854 --> 05:06.348
I told Kate you were pulling my leg.

05:06.438 --> 05:09.108
The Navy's giving us
a priority ride today.

05:09.483 --> 05:10.646
You mean it?

05:11.694 --> 05:12.974
You do mean it.

05:13.946 --> 05:16.383
Normally, I hate priority rides,
but who cares if it's going...

05:16.407 --> 05:17.551
What's wrong with priority rides?

05:17.575 --> 05:20.011
Come on, boss. You're telling me
you like sitting on canvas seats

05:20.035 --> 05:21.316
slung between cargo pallets?

05:21.412 --> 05:24.199
Yeah, it makes me feel
like I'm back in the Corps.

05:32.548 --> 05:34.540
I love priority rides.

05:34.633 --> 05:36.341
Boss, this is the best!

05:36.427 --> 05:38.051
I miss canvas seats.

05:38.512 --> 05:40.172
Check this out.

05:41.765 --> 05:43.141
What do you want?

05:43.851 --> 05:46.176
- Get to work.
- I already started.

05:47.313 --> 05:50.314
"Guantanamo enjoys
a year round tropical climate

05:50.399 --> 05:53.020
"cooled by the breezes
from the Windward Passage.

05:53.110 --> 05:56.561
"Some of the more
popular pastimes include skin diving,

05:56.655 --> 05:58.944
"sunbathing and horseback riding."

05:59.992 --> 06:02.613
I would be the last one
to rain on your parade, Fidel,

06:02.703 --> 06:05.490
but you're logged onto
an official Navy website.

06:05.581 --> 06:07.906
- It's PR.
- This isn't.

06:08.000 --> 06:11.499
It's the NCIS file
on Special Agent Paula Cassidy.

06:11.587 --> 06:13.378
She's an interrogator at Camp Delta.

06:13.464 --> 06:16.583
Special Agent Cassidy
is not to know that Sa'id is dead.

06:16.884 --> 06:18.129
We're not working with her?

06:18.218 --> 06:21.219
Sa'id was carrying
five unmailed letters of hers.

06:21.472 --> 06:24.010
Until we find out
how she was involved with him,

06:24.099 --> 06:25.179
she's out of the loop.

06:25.267 --> 06:28.019
I can't believe
we're in a $40 million Gulfstream.

06:28.103 --> 06:30.262
I mean, it's gotta be CNO's
or SECNAVS.

06:30.356 --> 06:31.875
You know,
Tiger Woods has one of these.

06:31.899 --> 06:33.441
Tom Cruise, all the big movie stars.

06:33.525 --> 06:35.185
- This is their ride.
- Tony?

06:35.277 --> 06:36.392
Yeah, boss?

06:36.487 --> 06:37.862
Can we get to work?

06:37.947 --> 06:40.616
Sure thing. Just check this out.

06:42.743 --> 06:43.988
It's a Gulfstream.

06:56.590 --> 06:59.081
So much for the element of surprise.

07:00.094 --> 07:01.469
Welcome to Gitmo.

07:01.553 --> 07:03.546
I'm Special Agent Paula Cassidy.

07:03.639 --> 07:06.640
Special Agent Jethro Gibbs.
Special Agent Kate Todd.

07:06.725 --> 07:07.804
- Hi.
- How are you?

07:07.893 --> 07:09.553
- Special Agent Anthony DiNozzo.
- Hey.

07:09.645 --> 07:11.436
Hello. I heard you all were coming.

07:11.522 --> 07:14.523
- Nice ride.
- You are so right there.

07:14.608 --> 07:17.277
This is yours. There's a map in it.

07:17.361 --> 07:20.278
They've put you up
in one of the nicest houses on the base.

07:20.364 --> 07:22.736
We appreciate that,
Special Agent Cassidy.

07:22.950 --> 07:26.200
So is there something going down
that I should know about?

07:26.495 --> 07:27.574
No.

07:28.247 --> 07:31.830
It's just that
all my transcripts have been pulled,

07:32.584 --> 07:34.328
my interrogations have been cancelled,

07:34.420 --> 07:37.586
and then you all arrive
on the Navy Gulfstream.

07:38.507 --> 07:40.500
How would you connect the dots?

07:41.176 --> 07:42.421
I wouldn't.

07:44.638 --> 07:47.592
Okay. Enjoy your stay.

08:19.381 --> 08:22.916
Okay. We'll set up here.

08:23.218 --> 08:26.718
Tomorrow morning we'll be joined
by the senior FBI translator,

08:26.805 --> 08:29.047
who's gonna bring transcripts
of Sa'id's translations.

08:29.141 --> 08:32.426
The interrogator
was Special Agent Cassidy.

08:37.191 --> 08:38.815
No way!

08:38.900 --> 08:40.893
It's the only bedroom with a bath.

08:40.986 --> 08:43.227
I know. And I picked it first.

08:43.822 --> 08:46.740
Women take baths.
Men take showers, Tony.

08:48.243 --> 08:52.111
Why does the woman thing come up
when a ship is sinking,

08:52.206 --> 08:54.779
or when there's
only one bedroom with a bath?

08:54.958 --> 08:56.156
Gibbs.

08:56.251 --> 08:59.455
Well, you were right
about Sa'id's laptop. System's virgin.

08:59.546 --> 09:01.691
Yeah, well, we'll track down the
hard drive he had here

09:01.715 --> 09:02.794
and ship it to you.

09:02.883 --> 09:05.754
- When's your rock boy coming?
- In the morning.

09:05.844 --> 09:07.386
My mother's very excited.

09:07.471 --> 09:08.550
Find anything else?

09:08.639 --> 09:11.640
Yeah, I picked up another scent
on his shorts and his T-shirts.

09:11.725 --> 09:13.350
What did Sa'id do, bathe in the stuff?

09:13.435 --> 09:14.811
No, it's not his.

09:14.895 --> 09:19.142
It's peach and musk,
with vanilla as a top note.

09:19.233 --> 09:20.264
It's definitely feminine.

09:20.359 --> 09:21.734
Well, tag it.

09:21.819 --> 09:23.147
Perfume is expensive, Gibbs.

09:23.237 --> 09:24.435
I can't just hang out

09:24.530 --> 09:26.771
at the Macy's tester tray with my lab kit.

09:26.865 --> 09:28.739
They frown on that sort of behaviour.

09:28.826 --> 09:31.399
Buy what you need to, Abby.
We'll deal with it later.

09:31.495 --> 09:33.986
Bold, Gibbs. Bold.

09:36.333 --> 09:38.326
- We're finished.
- And we need to talk to you.

09:38.418 --> 09:40.458
Whatever. It'll have to wait
till the morning.

09:40.546 --> 09:41.874
Well, it's kind of important.

09:41.964 --> 09:45.380
I appreciate that, but I'm going to bed.

09:46.802 --> 09:48.344
Talk to you mañana.

09:53.851 --> 09:56.258
Any preference
on the remaining bedrooms?

09:56.645 --> 09:58.768
No. They're both equally crappy.

10:06.113 --> 10:07.192
You pick.

10:07.281 --> 10:08.526
Ladies first.

10:12.536 --> 10:13.651
Night!

10:26.967 --> 10:28.046
God!

10:29.928 --> 10:31.209
Halt!

10:46.403 --> 10:47.897
I need coffee.

10:49.573 --> 10:51.281
Where'd you get this, Abby?

10:51.366 --> 10:54.237
If I told you,
I'd have to kill you, Benjamin.

10:54.328 --> 10:57.697
You know, this was very sweet,
but you did not have to bring me a gift.

10:57.789 --> 10:59.332
I wanted to.

10:59.416 --> 11:02.287
And your mother said
it was something you could use.

11:04.379 --> 11:06.538
Right on. Thanks.

11:07.049 --> 11:09.207
Benjamin, this is... This is great.

11:15.224 --> 11:17.549
So the emerald. Is it real?

11:18.268 --> 11:19.597
Oh, it's... It's very real.

11:19.686 --> 11:23.554
Colour grade 2.5,
tone one to two, clarity I-1.

11:23.649 --> 11:26.934
I mean, it's at least worth $20,000.

11:28.070 --> 11:29.896
And the colour is quite distinct.

11:29.988 --> 11:31.233
It's bluish apple green.

11:31.323 --> 11:34.490
And the fluid inclusions are
quite different than Colombian stones.

11:34.576 --> 11:37.577
This emerald was mined
in the Panjshir Valley.

11:37.663 --> 11:39.157
Where's that?

11:39.539 --> 11:40.702
Afghanistan.

11:52.702 --> 11:54.861
- William Gamal.
- Bill.

11:54.954 --> 11:56.283
Senior translator, Camp Delta.

11:56.373 --> 11:58.100
We've been expecting you.
Special Agent Gibbs,

11:58.124 --> 12:00.164
Special Agent DiNozzo and Todd.

12:00.251 --> 12:03.502
When the FBI relaxes their dress code,
they sure go for it.

12:05.006 --> 12:06.548
Well, these are the transcripts

12:06.633 --> 12:09.124
of the interrogations
of Nasser Al Jazeir you requested.

12:09.219 --> 12:11.792
- The translator was Sa'id?
- That's right.

12:11.888 --> 12:13.762
Apparently there's a problem?

12:13.848 --> 12:14.928
Did you know him?

12:15.016 --> 12:16.760
Only to say hello.

12:16.851 --> 12:19.473
He worked with the interrogator
Paula Cassidy.

12:22.023 --> 12:24.728
You might want
to think about keeping that door shut.

12:24.818 --> 12:27.190
Iguanas have been known
to wander inside.

12:32.075 --> 12:34.696
Nasser arrived in June
from Afghanistan.

12:34.953 --> 12:37.574
Yes. Insists he was
picked up by mistake.

12:37.664 --> 12:38.992
Weren't they all?

12:39.082 --> 12:41.787
Agent Cassidy did especially well
with the subject.

12:41.876 --> 12:44.996
Younger detainees feel more
comfortable with female interrogators.

12:45.088 --> 12:48.338
Once rapport has been established,

12:48.425 --> 12:51.129
the prisoner's
only interrogated by that team.

12:53.263 --> 12:56.133
I understand Agent Cassidy
is not in on the loop on this?

12:56.224 --> 12:57.303
Correct.

12:59.144 --> 13:01.469
I booked you
an interrogation room for this afternoon.

13:01.563 --> 13:03.970
Well, we better get started.

13:10.113 --> 13:12.948
Okay, I wanna know more
about Agent Cassidy.

13:13.032 --> 13:14.527
Who her friends are in Gitmo.

13:14.617 --> 13:16.859
How she spends her free time.
Where she hangs out.

13:16.953 --> 13:18.780
Was she involved with Sa'id.

13:18.872 --> 13:19.986
- Sure.
- No problem.

13:20.081 --> 13:21.659
Did I say both of you?

13:22.625 --> 13:25.116
Well, you didn't not say
both of us, Gibbs.

13:25.211 --> 13:26.689
Yeah, she's kind of
got a point there, boss.

13:26.713 --> 13:29.833
Yeah, well, I'm saying it now.
DiNozzo, you go.

13:29.924 --> 13:32.795
- Kate'll stay here and help me with this.
- Got it.

13:34.345 --> 13:36.883
- Do you mind telling me why he...
- Yeah.

13:38.475 --> 13:40.882
Agent Cassidy has a lot
of friends, I'll say that.

13:40.977 --> 13:42.056
Mostly male friends

13:42.145 --> 13:45.430
and mostly either
interrogators or translators.

13:45.523 --> 13:46.554
Where does she hang?

13:46.649 --> 13:48.808
A club on base called El Floridita.

13:48.902 --> 13:50.360
Check it out.

13:50.820 --> 13:52.612
Observe her if she's there.

13:53.323 --> 13:55.066
- Can I drink?
- Sure.

13:56.534 --> 13:57.779
Sarsaparilla.

13:58.870 --> 14:02.037
- Sarsaparilla? Who drinks sarsaparilla?
- Shane.

14:02.332 --> 14:03.577
Who's Shane?

14:03.833 --> 14:06.668
- Alan Ladd.
- Who's Alan Ladd?

14:06.753 --> 14:09.505
- Maybe you should check her out, Kate.
- I'm on it!

14:21.976 --> 14:24.052
Where is Agent DiNozzo?

14:24.145 --> 14:26.185
Drinking sarsaparilla.

14:26.272 --> 14:27.517
They'll bring Nasser down

14:27.607 --> 14:29.084
as soon as
the evening prayers are finished.

14:29.108 --> 14:30.733
Why aren't you praying?

14:31.152 --> 14:32.528
I'm Presbyterian.

14:37.116 --> 14:39.156
How do you say "good cop, bad cop"
in Arabic?

14:39.244 --> 14:40.406
I learned my Arabic

14:40.495 --> 14:42.223
at the Defence Language Institute
in Monterey.

14:42.247 --> 14:43.871
That phrase wasn't in the syllabus.

14:43.957 --> 14:45.914
Nasser should be here
in about five minutes.

14:46.000 --> 14:47.660
Watch his body language.

14:57.178 --> 15:00.594
Fortunately, Nasser speaks
some English.

15:10.567 --> 15:13.022
So Jack Palance shoots Elisha Cook.

15:13.111 --> 15:16.811
The slug lifts his body off the ground
and splat, right into the mud.

15:16.906 --> 15:18.282
Elisha Cook?

15:18.366 --> 15:20.323
Have you ever seen
The Maltese Falcon?

15:20.410 --> 15:21.441
Nope.

15:21.536 --> 15:24.027
You young people
don't know what good movies are.

15:24.122 --> 15:26.873
All this violence today. It's so sad.

15:27.250 --> 15:29.077
"Splat" isn't violent?

15:30.879 --> 15:32.373
What're you drinking?

15:33.840 --> 15:36.247
- Sarsaparilla.
- Root beer.

15:37.176 --> 15:40.343
- So you're on duty?
- Maybe I just like sarsaparilla.

15:41.931 --> 15:43.509
Cosmo, Jimmy.

15:43.600 --> 15:45.308
Coming up.

15:45.393 --> 15:48.180
That's funny.
I knew you were gonna order a cosmo.

15:48.354 --> 15:50.228
Are you here to check me out?

15:50.648 --> 15:52.226
Define "checking out."

15:52.984 --> 15:56.020
- Come on. What are you doing here?
- Straight up?

15:56.446 --> 15:58.438
No. I want you to lie to me.

16:00.283 --> 16:01.658
You turn me on.

16:05.163 --> 16:06.871
- Here, let me pay.
- No, thanks.

16:06.956 --> 16:08.367
I buy my own drinks.

16:17.258 --> 16:19.666
So, Jack Palance shoots Elijah Wood.

16:46.079 --> 16:47.621
He asks who we are.

16:48.581 --> 16:50.289
Name is Gibbs.

16:51.084 --> 16:54.038
US Naval Criminal Investigative Service.

16:57.006 --> 16:58.251
Sit down.

16:58.675 --> 17:00.050
Where is Paula?

17:00.385 --> 17:02.093
She's been replaced.

17:02.720 --> 17:03.799
By me.

17:05.098 --> 17:06.473
Why?

17:07.016 --> 17:08.558
I think you know why.

17:09.769 --> 17:10.848
No.

17:11.396 --> 17:14.065
Well, sit down, Nasser. I'll tell you why.

17:24.659 --> 17:25.987
Sa'id is dead.

17:35.962 --> 17:37.207
He's praying.

17:50.351 --> 17:51.596
That's it. There you go.

17:51.686 --> 17:52.765
Thank you.

17:57.608 --> 17:58.853
Miss me?

17:59.444 --> 18:00.606
Like herpes.

18:01.779 --> 18:03.606
- Now that confuses me.
- Really?

18:03.698 --> 18:05.009
Absolutely. If you don't like me,

18:05.033 --> 18:07.820
then why do you keep
coming over here for refills?

18:08.578 --> 18:09.609
Jimmy?

18:12.582 --> 18:13.910
I like the game.

18:14.125 --> 18:15.240
Me, too.

18:17.420 --> 18:18.535
Your move.

18:19.672 --> 18:22.459
You've been here eight months
and you haven't hooked up.

18:22.550 --> 18:23.961
Well, how do you know?

18:24.052 --> 18:25.487
You danced with five different guys.

18:25.511 --> 18:26.780
Nothing going on with any of them.

18:26.804 --> 18:29.260
You're counting the men
that I'm dancing with?

18:29.348 --> 18:30.843
I'm the jealous type.

18:32.351 --> 18:34.095
Jimmy, does he seem
like the jealous type?

18:34.187 --> 18:36.512
- I thought so.
- See?

18:36.606 --> 18:37.685
Till he flashed his badge

18:37.774 --> 18:39.683
when I wouldn't answer
any questions about you.

18:39.776 --> 18:41.567
More info than she needed, Jimmy.

18:41.652 --> 18:43.277
I'm disappointed.

18:43.362 --> 18:45.984
What if I told you
I was checking out the competition?

18:46.074 --> 18:48.362
- I'd say you were lying.
- No, it's true.

18:48.451 --> 18:50.574
I am checking out the competition.

18:51.079 --> 18:52.621
For your investigation.

18:52.705 --> 18:53.903
And for me.

18:55.333 --> 18:57.456
So what are you
gonna write in your report?

18:57.543 --> 19:00.793
That you have rules about hooking up
with men you work with.

19:00.963 --> 19:02.043
Accurate?

19:02.215 --> 19:03.460
Incomplete.

19:04.008 --> 19:06.879
I have rules about guys
that investigate me, too.

19:07.887 --> 19:09.381
Never broken a rule?

19:09.764 --> 19:10.795
Have you?

19:11.557 --> 19:13.265
If the risk is worth it.

19:14.185 --> 19:15.264
Jimmy.

19:19.440 --> 19:20.816
Let's dance.

19:27.490 --> 19:29.198
Sa'id was a good man.

19:30.118 --> 19:32.609
He gave me hope
I would see my family again.

19:34.914 --> 19:38.034
He said America does not hate Islam.

19:38.918 --> 19:42.038
And Allah knows we are here.

19:42.964 --> 19:45.122
Don't you want to know how he died?

19:48.136 --> 19:50.294
- Or have you guessed?
- He guessed.

19:50.388 --> 19:52.012
How would I know?

19:52.348 --> 19:55.053
We have no contact here
with the outside world.

20:07.155 --> 20:08.530
He swallowed these.

20:10.408 --> 20:11.783
They killed him.

20:13.452 --> 20:14.911
I think he got them from you.

20:17.832 --> 20:19.326
I don't understand.

20:32.054 --> 20:34.261
He says he's never seen them before.

20:41.022 --> 20:44.521
He would like to return to his cell
so he can pray for his friend's soul.

20:44.609 --> 20:46.482
Tell him he's not going back to his cell.

20:49.655 --> 20:51.399
He's being transferred to isolation.

20:57.079 --> 21:00.164
He says he was promised
a transfer to minimum security.

21:00.708 --> 21:02.333
Who promised him that?

21:03.377 --> 21:05.002
Special Agent Cassidy.

21:10.051 --> 21:11.130
One sec.

21:13.346 --> 21:14.425
DiNozzo.

21:14.513 --> 21:17.349
Back at the house.

21:17.433 --> 21:18.844
Be there in five.

21:20.311 --> 21:21.935
I'm back on duty.

21:22.021 --> 21:23.349
Well, that's too bad.

21:23.439 --> 21:24.602
So are you.

21:30.280 --> 21:33.696
Why'd you recommend transferring
Nasser to minimum security?

21:34.534 --> 21:36.492
Reward for cooperation.

21:36.954 --> 21:38.329
That's the idea around here.

21:38.413 --> 21:42.078
We read the transcripts. He didn't
tell us anything we didn't know.

21:42.584 --> 21:45.502
Well, that's not the point.
He told us all that he knows.

21:45.587 --> 21:46.832
Are you sure?

21:48.006 --> 21:49.548
It's a judgment call.

21:49.675 --> 21:52.960
But we get a lot of flak around here
for holding people too long.

21:53.053 --> 21:55.295
Are you gonna tell me what's going on?

21:56.223 --> 21:59.923
Are you gonna tell us what was going on
between you and Sa'id?

22:00.018 --> 22:01.678
We worked together.

22:01.770 --> 22:02.885
That's all.

22:04.147 --> 22:06.306
These were found in Sa'id's luggage.

22:07.693 --> 22:09.769
Well, he was gonna put them
in the mail for me.

22:09.861 --> 22:11.222
You couldn't find the post office?

22:15.284 --> 22:17.490
Mail is slow out of Gitmo.

22:17.577 --> 22:18.888
Sa'id was on his way to the States

22:18.912 --> 22:20.905
and I asked him
to throw them in the mail for me.

22:20.998 --> 22:22.622
Do you mind if we open them?

22:22.708 --> 22:24.332
Yes, I mind. They're private.

22:24.418 --> 22:25.746
We'll get a court order.

22:25.836 --> 22:27.663
What the hell is this about?

22:27.796 --> 22:29.836
Why do you have these letters?

22:32.634 --> 22:34.461
Something happened to Sa'id.

22:35.971 --> 22:37.169
He's dead.

22:39.516 --> 22:41.141
Oh, my God.

22:41.518 --> 22:43.345
How? What happened?

22:47.065 --> 22:49.105
Tell me how he died!

22:49.234 --> 22:51.606
Internal bleeding
from a perforated bowel,

22:51.695 --> 22:54.612
caused by the presence
of hard objects in his intestines.

22:54.698 --> 22:57.652
Hard objects? What the hell
is that supposed to mean?

23:00.245 --> 23:01.443
Look,

23:01.538 --> 23:04.954
I have been a damn good NCIS agent
for over six years now.

23:05.042 --> 23:07.367
I really don't deserve
to be treated like this.

23:07.461 --> 23:10.034
All we asked is,
can we open these letters?

23:10.172 --> 23:12.378
Sure. Go head. Open the damn things.

23:12.466 --> 23:13.545
Thank you.

23:15.427 --> 23:16.707
They're to my family.

23:16.803 --> 23:19.377
Would you like to search my apartment
while you're at it?

23:19.473 --> 23:21.382
- I would.
- Okay.

23:31.193 --> 23:32.687
Sorry, Paula.

23:36.990 --> 23:39.030
Check out Sa'id's apartment, too.

23:42.371 --> 23:44.826
First time I've seen you
apologise to a suspect.

23:44.915 --> 23:46.893
How would you feel
if I was gonna search your apartment?

23:46.917 --> 23:48.328
Violated beyond belief.

23:48.418 --> 23:50.188
You know why you're attracted to her,
though, don't you?

23:50.212 --> 23:51.612
- Who said I was?
- It's endorphins.

23:51.671 --> 23:52.916
Thank you, Abby.

23:53.006 --> 23:56.589
You were so excited about
going to Cuba and riding in the jet.

23:56.676 --> 23:58.477
It stimulated the hell
out of your endorphins.

23:58.512 --> 24:00.588
The first woman you saw
was like honey to a bear.

24:00.680 --> 24:02.721
You were the first woman
I saw on my endorphin high.

24:02.808 --> 24:05.809
Yeah, well, we work together, Tony.
It's like a brother-sister thing.

24:05.894 --> 24:08.052
- Never had a sister.
- That's probably a good thing.

24:08.146 --> 24:10.269
We just passed Sa'id's room, sis.

24:17.739 --> 24:19.020
Need some help?

24:19.366 --> 24:20.611
No.

24:29.751 --> 24:31.376
Tony, wait.

24:40.303 --> 24:42.426
Sa'id had a key to her apartment.

24:43.056 --> 24:45.381
Well, she doesn't have a key to his.

24:45.475 --> 24:47.800
Women like making love
in their own bed.

24:48.478 --> 24:51.183
Now, wait a minute. Just 'cause
you're woman and you enjoy doing it.

24:51.273 --> 24:53.764
- You're right. I misspoke.
Does not mean that all women

24:53.859 --> 24:57.524
- I was wrong, Tony. Let it go!
Insist on doing it in their own bed.

25:04.870 --> 25:06.494
Gonna read me my rights?

25:06.580 --> 25:09.284
You have the right
to be reimbursed for postage.

25:10.333 --> 25:12.373
Put it on your expense report.

25:12.461 --> 25:13.575
Thanks.

25:14.087 --> 25:16.958
You might want
to take that chip off your shoulder.

25:17.340 --> 25:18.585
Gladly.

25:18.967 --> 25:21.339
Just treat me as a member of the team.

25:21.428 --> 25:23.136
We're in the same agency,

25:23.972 --> 25:25.514
not on the same team.

25:28.310 --> 25:30.018
Is this interrogation over?

25:30.103 --> 25:31.681
Yeah. Yeah, almost.

25:33.231 --> 25:35.901
Why is Special Agent DiNozzo sorry?

25:36.485 --> 25:38.810
He blew his chance to get laid.

25:45.076 --> 25:48.243
This just came for you
from Guantanamo Bay.

25:48.705 --> 25:51.457
It's Sa'id's hard drive. Excellent.

25:53.585 --> 25:54.830
Quite a collection.

25:54.920 --> 25:57.755
Yeah, I'm trying to match a scent I found
on Sa'id's clothes.

25:57.839 --> 26:00.046
I don't see Chanel No. 5.

26:00.425 --> 26:02.299
Does anyone wear that anymore?

26:02.385 --> 26:05.137
- My mother does.
- Really?

26:05.263 --> 26:08.466
Ever since Marilyn Monroe
confessed that Chanel No. 5

26:08.558 --> 26:10.266
was all she wore to bed.

26:10.477 --> 26:12.600
So, does your mother...

26:13.396 --> 26:15.104
Unfortunately, yes.

26:15.440 --> 26:18.109
Makes for terribly awkward
slumber parties.

26:21.321 --> 26:23.278
Nasser is extremely upset.

26:23.365 --> 26:26.282
Feels he's been cooperative
and now he's in a cell with no windows.

26:26.368 --> 26:29.534
Well, maybe after losing all this luxury,

26:29.621 --> 26:31.614
he'll be even more cooperative.

26:32.290 --> 26:35.125
Well, a psychiatrist examined him
and is worried for his mental health.

26:35.210 --> 26:37.333
I'm not all that interested
in the mental health

26:37.420 --> 26:39.247
of people who wanna kill me.

26:40.257 --> 26:42.830
You're certain Nasser is a terrorist?

26:45.220 --> 26:47.177
Isn't it possible
that he is what he says he is?

26:47.264 --> 26:49.075
A man who was in the wrong place
at the wrong time?

26:49.099 --> 26:50.510
Yeah. And it's also possible

26:50.600 --> 26:53.138
that he's the man
who gave Sa'id those emeralds.

26:53.228 --> 26:54.722
Why would he do that?

26:55.522 --> 26:56.933
Are you that naive?

26:57.023 --> 27:00.938
Or did Nasser pass
some of those emeralds on to you?

27:06.032 --> 27:08.358
What are all these bottles, Abby?

27:08.952 --> 27:10.743
That's the perfume you said I could buy.

27:10.829 --> 27:12.157
Do we have to buy so many?

27:12.247 --> 27:13.445
I only got 30.

27:13.540 --> 27:15.829
There's more than 2,500 on the market.

27:16.459 --> 27:17.622
You're kidding me.

27:17.711 --> 27:21.162
Perfume is the most powerful accessory
a woman can wear.

27:21.256 --> 27:23.545
Yeah, well, how much
did all this power cost us?

27:23.633 --> 27:25.092
Around $1,500.

27:25.468 --> 27:27.212
$1,500?

27:27.304 --> 27:28.466
Well, not including the tax.

27:28.555 --> 27:31.888
I stuck to the 30 most popular scents,
hoping we'd get lucky.

27:33.059 --> 27:34.886
How fiscally responsible, Ab.

27:34.978 --> 27:36.009
Thank you.

27:36.104 --> 27:38.891
So, did we get any bang for our $1,500?

27:38.982 --> 27:40.145
We did.

27:40.233 --> 27:44.562
The perfume
on Sa'id's clothes is called "Escada."

27:46.990 --> 27:48.188
Never heard of it.

27:48.283 --> 27:50.359
Do you want to hear
about his hard drive?

27:50.452 --> 27:51.732
What's it gonna cost me?

27:51.828 --> 27:54.615
It's pretty much synonymous
with his sex drive.

27:54.706 --> 27:58.122
Our boy deleted 20 gigs of porn before
he turned his drive in.

27:58.209 --> 28:00.535
He was trading
with a porn pal on a Hotmail account

28:00.629 --> 28:01.957
that doesn't exist anymore.

28:02.047 --> 28:03.707
Anything good on it?

28:03.798 --> 28:05.506
Nothing with sawdust, yet.

28:07.636 --> 28:09.178
Agent Cassidy's?

28:09.262 --> 28:10.293
Yeah.

28:10.680 --> 28:13.765
And nothing else of interest
in her apartment except...

28:15.810 --> 28:16.973
What?

28:17.896 --> 28:21.016
She had a bottle of Escada
on her dresser.

28:21.107 --> 28:25.022
And Sa'id had a key to her apartment,
but she did not have a key to his.

28:25.445 --> 28:27.521
Most women prefer their own beds.

28:28.907 --> 28:32.358
So, she and Sa'id were doing
the horizontal salsa.

28:32.452 --> 28:35.073
Not according to the bartender
at El Floridita.

28:35.163 --> 28:36.443
What?

28:36.539 --> 28:38.746
Lovers register with him at Gitmo first?

28:38.833 --> 28:40.660
Bartenders know this kind of stuff, boss.

28:40.752 --> 28:43.193
He said she went there most nights,
danced with a lot of guys,

28:43.254 --> 28:45.330
but always went home alone.

28:46.925 --> 28:49.001
What'd you find out, Kate?

28:50.011 --> 28:52.383
Sa'id's place wasn't just clean.
It was sterilised.

28:52.472 --> 28:55.841
There were some towels,
soap and a half a roll of toilet paper.

28:55.934 --> 28:59.054
I think Sa'id copied Paula's key
without her knowing it.

28:59.396 --> 29:01.887
Now, which brain
is thinking that, DiNozzo?

29:04.192 --> 29:05.734
I'm hitting the rack.

29:11.658 --> 29:14.528
Get this off to Abby
first thing in the morning.

29:15.662 --> 29:17.868
You know, Gibbs,
sometimes you can be a real...

29:17.956 --> 29:19.035
Bastard?

29:20.667 --> 29:21.781
Yes.

29:21.960 --> 29:25.543
Yeah, well, my gut is telling me
Agent Cassidy is telling the truth.

29:25.630 --> 29:27.421
So then what's the problem?

29:29.050 --> 29:32.051
Romance between agents, Kate.

29:33.346 --> 29:34.888
It never works.

29:36.141 --> 29:38.264
Are you speaking from experience?

29:47.068 --> 29:48.942
Sa'id and I were not lovers.

29:49.112 --> 29:50.487
Who told you that?

29:50.655 --> 29:51.818
A room key.

29:52.907 --> 29:54.699
Had yours on his key chain.

29:55.952 --> 29:57.446
That's not possible.

29:57.704 --> 29:58.949
How would he get my room key?

29:59.038 --> 30:01.114
- You gave it to him.
- No, I didn't!

30:03.793 --> 30:05.537
I lost a key.

30:05.920 --> 30:07.379
Had to replace one.

30:07.797 --> 30:09.624
Sa'id could have stolen it.

30:10.383 --> 30:13.135
Are you just remembering now
that you lost a key?

30:13.219 --> 30:15.675
I was just told
that somebody else had it.

30:17.140 --> 30:18.219
Okay.

30:18.975 --> 30:20.968
Okay, let's say that I buy that.

30:22.145 --> 30:24.683
Why would he want a key to your room?

30:25.815 --> 30:27.689
To get to my computer.

30:27.776 --> 30:29.815
But how does he get my password?

30:31.112 --> 30:34.149
If you don't keep your doors shut,
the iguanas get in.

30:34.991 --> 30:37.363
We did so many interrogations together,

30:37.827 --> 30:39.986
he could have watched me type it in.

30:42.081 --> 30:44.751
Why would Sa'id want
to get into your computer?

30:44.834 --> 30:47.586
To read my interrogation reports.
I don't know.

30:47.670 --> 30:50.506
Lately, I noticed that
his conversations with Nasser

30:50.590 --> 30:53.211
seemed longer than his translations.

30:53.343 --> 30:55.668
I even noted that in my computer.

30:58.431 --> 31:02.215
Sa'id took leave
and left the next day for the States.

31:02.310 --> 31:03.341
Right after I wrote that.

31:03.436 --> 31:06.390
His room was empty.
He wasn't intending to come back.

31:07.649 --> 31:10.436
I should have had Bill come and sit in
on one of the interrogations

31:10.527 --> 31:12.436
and check my suspicions.

31:13.154 --> 31:14.233
I blew it.

31:16.908 --> 31:18.236
These are the hard objects

31:18.326 --> 31:20.782
that Sa'id had
in his stomach when he died.

31:21.120 --> 31:22.365
Emeralds?

31:22.789 --> 31:24.828
I think he got them from Nasser.

31:24.999 --> 31:27.834
How did Nasser get them
past our body search?

31:33.174 --> 31:35.214
Nasser complained
of constipation when he arrived

31:35.301 --> 31:37.093
and they gave him a laxative.

31:37.178 --> 31:39.848
He got them in
the same way Sa'id got them out.

31:40.557 --> 31:42.466
What are you looking at, Abby?

31:43.434 --> 31:44.763
It's just sex, Ducky.

31:44.853 --> 31:47.178
- Just sex?
- Yeah.

31:47.355 --> 31:50.605
You know, the biological act
between creatures within a species

31:50.692 --> 31:53.443
in response to neurological
and physiological stimuli.

31:53.528 --> 31:56.019
Between creatures within a species?

31:56.614 --> 31:57.729
Usually.

31:58.116 --> 32:00.607
- This isn't yours, I hope.
- No!

32:00.785 --> 32:04.154
It's off Sa'id's hard drive.
But something's wrong.

32:04.664 --> 32:06.491
The files are too big.

32:08.084 --> 32:09.993
Not just the files.

32:22.181 --> 32:23.344
Easter eggs.

32:23.433 --> 32:25.093
What the hell are Easter eggs?

32:25.184 --> 32:28.138
Easter eggs are hidden messages
within a computer program.

32:28.229 --> 32:29.474
If you don't know to look,

32:29.564 --> 32:31.307
you don't know they're there.

32:31.399 --> 32:32.597
They were hidden in the porn?

32:32.692 --> 32:36.476
My cursor has moved across places
that would make Tony blush.

32:36.571 --> 32:37.685
What kind of messages?

32:37.780 --> 32:41.695
There's a diagram of the camp
and a bunch of stuff in Arabic.

32:41.784 --> 32:43.243
It's coming to you now.

32:43.328 --> 32:46.364
Something tells me
it's not a greeting from the Bunny.

32:49.876 --> 32:53.043
Sa'id arrived Gitmo April 23rd.

32:54.297 --> 32:57.796
April 28th he writes,
"Son-in-law located."

32:57.967 --> 33:01.882
May 11th, "Son-in-law moved
to minimum security."

33:03.306 --> 33:05.464
May 23rd he gets a response.

33:05.558 --> 33:08.132
"Leader disavows son-in-law.

33:08.227 --> 33:12.724
"He will be eliminated
by the one who is victorious."

33:13.107 --> 33:14.139
Leader?

33:15.401 --> 33:16.646
Bin Laden.

33:17.820 --> 33:20.062
My God. We've got
one of bin Laden's son-in-laws here

33:20.156 --> 33:21.401
and didn't know it.

33:21.491 --> 33:23.199
"The one who is victorious"?

33:23.534 --> 33:25.471
Why does he start talking
in riddles all of a sudden?

33:25.495 --> 33:27.618
I don't think he is.

33:27.705 --> 33:30.161
I may not be translating that accurately.

33:34.587 --> 33:38.632
Nasser is old Arabic for
"the one who is victorious."

33:39.550 --> 33:42.754
I owe you an apology, Gibbs.

33:42.971 --> 33:45.129
If I'd transferred Nasser
into minimum security...

33:45.223 --> 33:46.682
You didn't. Don't worry about it.

33:48.101 --> 33:50.093
How do we find this son-in-law?

33:53.648 --> 33:54.893
Easy.

33:56.776 --> 34:00.560
We transfer Nasser
to minimum security so he can kill him.

34:04.483 --> 34:07.271
At Camp Delta,
the security buck stops with me.

34:07.361 --> 34:10.777
If Nasser kills a detainee,
it'll be my ass.

34:11.324 --> 34:13.362
Yeah. But,

34:13.451 --> 34:17.116
once the son-in-law learns that
Bin Laden ordered him murdered,

34:17.205 --> 34:19.362
he's going to sing like
a bird in Islamic paradise

34:19.456 --> 34:21.699
and maybe that prevents another 9/11.

34:22.543 --> 34:24.251
What's your plan, Gibbs?

34:24.629 --> 34:26.585
We transfer Nasser
to minimum security.

34:26.672 --> 34:29.792
From isolation to minimum security?
He's bound to be suspicious.

34:29.884 --> 34:32.801
A new interrogator will have to deliver
the news convincingly.

34:32.887 --> 34:35.460
Since we know
he trusts women, that's me.

34:36.641 --> 34:37.920
No, that's me.

34:39.101 --> 34:40.679
I'm the one he trusts.

34:41.187 --> 34:43.974
You promised him minimum security.
He got isolation.

34:44.065 --> 34:46.556
He won't believe
you have the authority to move him.

34:46.650 --> 34:49.188
He will when I order the guards
to remove the shackles.

34:49.277 --> 34:51.900
- That's too risky.
- Tony's right.

34:51.989 --> 34:55.607
Nasser and Sa'id did this
right in front of me.

34:55.701 --> 34:57.824
You're an interrogator, not a translator.

34:57.912 --> 34:59.655
You couldn't have known.

34:59.747 --> 35:01.027
But I did.

35:01.499 --> 35:04.334
I had suspicions about Sa'id
and I let them slide.

35:04.794 --> 35:07.166
- It's inexcusable.
- Yep.

35:08.256 --> 35:09.880
Let me make up for it.

35:11.175 --> 35:14.129
How good an actress
are you, Agent Cassidy?

35:16.264 --> 35:18.801
Ask Tony. He bought my act.

35:20.476 --> 35:22.932
- Icing me was an act?
- No.

35:23.896 --> 35:26.352
Letting you think I was melting was.

35:38.911 --> 35:41.402
Tony, she'd say anything
to get in that room.

35:41.497 --> 35:44.913
Kate, it's not a problem.
We were both playing a game.

35:45.501 --> 35:47.743
Yeah? Who won?

35:56.554 --> 35:57.965
Hello, Nasser.

35:58.723 --> 36:00.846
I did not expect we'd meet again.

36:01.183 --> 36:04.635
Neither did I. Remove the shackles.

36:07.773 --> 36:08.936
Now, please.

36:13.112 --> 36:14.440
Where is Gibbs?

36:14.780 --> 36:16.405
Recalled to Washington.

36:16.490 --> 36:20.239
His superiors determined
that his concerns were unfounded.

36:29.462 --> 36:30.920
He's not buying it.

36:32.048 --> 36:33.328
He will.

36:33.424 --> 36:36.840
Agent Gibbs
has had problems in the past.

36:36.927 --> 36:39.335
Agent Cassidy, this is inappropriate.

36:39.430 --> 36:40.889
He deserves to know.

36:41.098 --> 36:45.725
He has a history of building cases
at the expense of the facts.

36:48.314 --> 36:49.559
Tell him.

36:51.692 --> 36:52.807
She's good.

36:55.863 --> 36:58.152
I was locked up like a dog.

36:59.367 --> 37:02.154
It was out of my hands, Nasser.
I'm sorry.

37:03.954 --> 37:06.706
I've arranged to have you
returned to your cell.

37:10.294 --> 37:12.287
Just answer one question.

37:13.381 --> 37:15.088
Do you have a conscience?

37:19.887 --> 37:22.888
I have a moral awareness of my actions.

37:23.891 --> 37:25.006
Good.

37:26.852 --> 37:28.928
Because I've trusted you, Nasser.

37:30.439 --> 37:32.064
I am glad you are back.

37:33.651 --> 37:34.849
So am I.

37:35.861 --> 37:38.696
She's ending the session.
What is she doing?

37:39.198 --> 37:40.361
Playing him.

37:53.337 --> 37:55.828
He's asking about the transfer
to minimum security

37:55.923 --> 37:57.251
you promised him.

37:59.218 --> 38:00.629
I'll try.

38:07.143 --> 38:10.808
We have 120 detainees
in minimum security at present.

38:10.896 --> 38:12.688
20 to a unit.

38:13.149 --> 38:16.434
Barracks 20
is the one Nasser is assigned to.

38:16.694 --> 38:19.315
And this,
that's the inside surveillance cam.

38:19.405 --> 38:21.049
How many guards
do you have inside the barracks?

38:21.073 --> 38:23.742
Two. One on each exit. Front and rear.

38:23.993 --> 38:25.570
Odds are six to one against his target

38:25.661 --> 38:27.784
being billeted
in the same barracks as him.

38:27.872 --> 38:31.157
That means Nasser is gonna have to kill
his target in the exercise yard.

38:31.250 --> 38:33.159
What does Secret Service think?

38:33.252 --> 38:37.166
Three sharpshooters.
There, there and one in the watchtower.

38:37.381 --> 38:39.670
- I have an idea.
- It's about time.

38:39.842 --> 38:42.759
Nasser has to change his jumpsuit
when he transfers, right?

38:42.845 --> 38:45.087
Spanking brand-new white one. So?

38:45.306 --> 38:47.512
So I wanna add a little trim.

38:55.274 --> 38:58.228
You're being transferred
to minimum security, Nasser.

39:01.363 --> 39:03.071
You have kept your word.

39:04.325 --> 39:05.902
Does that surprise you?

39:06.702 --> 39:07.865
No.

39:08.287 --> 39:10.244
Don't betray my trust, Nasser.

39:12.208 --> 39:13.618
I will not.

39:21.675 --> 39:24.463
There. Right there.
They're bringing him out now.

39:27.681 --> 39:29.923
Talk about your own personal webcam.

39:30.851 --> 39:33.805
We only did enough of a search
to keep it legitimate.

39:38.776 --> 39:40.852
You think he already has a weapon?

39:40.945 --> 39:43.068
Yeah, I do. Probably a shiv.

39:43.322 --> 39:45.362
That makes sense. Easy to conceal.

39:45.449 --> 39:47.607
How does he make a shiv
in max security?

39:47.701 --> 39:51.913
A comb, a toothbrush,
something innocuous ground to a point.

40:14.478 --> 40:17.812
You're good. Bet you could have
made it in Hollywood.

40:20.317 --> 40:22.891
I don't know if I'm hoping you're right
or wrong about Nasser.

40:22.987 --> 40:25.359
He's a killer. It's in his eyes.

40:25.447 --> 40:27.820
Yeah. The eyes always give you away.

40:34.707 --> 40:36.035
Oh, yeah.

40:52.224 --> 40:54.846
Your target is the fifth detainee to exit.

40:54.935 --> 40:56.663
Acknowledge when you have him
in your sights.

40:56.687 --> 40:57.802
Roger that.

41:01.233 --> 41:02.562
Okay, I've got him.

41:21.295 --> 41:22.575
That's a diversion.

41:22.671 --> 41:24.463
I lost my target, Lieutenant. No shot.

41:24.548 --> 41:26.375
My sniper's lost his target.

41:26.550 --> 41:29.337
He's heading in the opposite direction,
Gibbs. He switched groups.

41:29.428 --> 41:31.255
He's going into barracks 21.

41:42.107 --> 41:44.942
He's made his man.
Where are your guards, Colonel?

41:50.115 --> 41:51.775
NCIS! Open up!

41:53.786 --> 41:55.862
- DiNozzo, go around back!
- Got it!

42:03.837 --> 42:04.952
Down!

42:06.548 --> 42:07.877
Get down!

42:14.014 --> 42:15.841
I'd have killed him.

42:15.933 --> 42:18.638
And make him a martyr? No.

42:18.727 --> 42:20.471
This is worse than death.

42:34.535 --> 42:37.204
She looks awfully lonely back there.

42:37.913 --> 42:39.193
So?

42:40.833 --> 42:44.036
So, I think one of us should go
and keep her company.

42:44.211 --> 42:45.242
Why?

42:45.629 --> 42:47.207
She is one of us.

42:48.549 --> 42:49.628
Kate.

42:50.384 --> 42:51.463
What?

42:53.887 --> 42:55.963
Well, I can't let her ride alone.

43:07.526 --> 43:11.571
Why is it that women always want to fix
what doesn't need fixing?

43:12.239 --> 43:14.730
It makes us feel all warm inside.

43:15.951 --> 43:18.703
So does scotch,
but it doesn't cost you a house.

43:22.916 --> 43:25.407
- I didn't really...
- I didn't think that...

43:26.587 --> 43:27.867
You go.

43:32.760 --> 43:33.922
Watch this.

43:40.601 --> 43:42.178
It's a Gulfstream.
