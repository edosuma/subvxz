WEBVTT

00:30.447 --> 00:32.533
Last night, one of our staff members

00:32.533 --> 00:36.161
leaked information about a guest
to <i>Espectacular</i> magazine.

00:36.662 --> 00:37.704
It's Máximo

00:38.288 --> 00:39.831
who will be helping me.

00:39.831 --> 00:43.252
He's my most trusted employee
since Don Pablo quit.

00:43.252 --> 00:46.505
So tell me what you know.

00:47.005 --> 00:51.385
I don't-- It wasn't--
Please don't fire me. It wasn't me.

00:51.718 --> 00:53.011
I don't know anything!

00:53.011 --> 00:55.848
I didn't even know
you could sell information!

00:56.682 --> 00:58.600
How much do they pay? Hypothetically.

00:58.892 --> 01:02.312
It wasn't us.
We refuse to talk to the press.

01:02.312 --> 01:05.816
And we will continue to refuse
until they return our calls.

01:05.816 --> 01:07.734
Wait, who's singing right now?

01:17.995 --> 01:20.414
Please don't tell Madonna I was crying.

01:20.414 --> 01:22.499
She'd be so disappointed.

01:24.042 --> 01:25.627
You're doing it all wrong.

01:25.878 --> 01:30.507
The art of interrogation is about making
the penalty for lying,

01:30.507 --> 01:33.552
worse than the penalty
for telling the truth.

01:35.470 --> 01:37.639
Where are your devices of persuasion?

01:37.806 --> 01:38.974
They should be visible.

01:38.974 --> 01:40.142
Don't you know anything?

01:40.142 --> 01:42.394
I know who the mole is.

01:42.394 --> 01:44.771
And I can't believe
our friend would do this to us.

01:47.941 --> 01:49.151
It's Memo.

01:50.736 --> 01:55.657
ACAPULCO

01:57.492 --> 01:59.119
It's good to see you.

01:59.119 --> 02:00.787
Thank you, Memo.

02:00.787 --> 02:03.874
How are you feeling
about the memorial service tomorrow?

02:03.874 --> 02:06.126
Sad that I have to say goodbye
to Don Pablo,

02:06.126 --> 02:08.711
nervous that I have to say hello
to everyone else.

02:08.711 --> 02:11.673
Yeah. Some people won't be thrilled
to see you.

02:12.174 --> 02:15.302
Good thing you brought your nephew here
as a body shield.

02:15.302 --> 02:17.095
That's the same joke I made.

02:17.095 --> 02:20.015
Even funnier the second time.
-Right?

02:20.015 --> 02:24.686
So, I was about to tell Hugo
about the night of Chad and Julia's...

02:24.686 --> 02:25.938
Bachelor parties.

02:27.189 --> 02:28.690
That was a crazy night.

02:28.690 --> 02:29.900
So cool...

02:30.317 --> 02:32.611
more stories from a hundred years ago.

02:34.029 --> 02:36.281
Memito. Don't make fun.

02:36.406 --> 02:37.991
Why don't you get a job?

02:38.408 --> 02:40.244
When I was your age, I'd already
worked in the laundry room

02:40.244 --> 02:43.205
and at the pool and I was
about to get the chance to--

02:43.205 --> 02:44.873
Hey. No spoilers.

02:45.791 --> 02:47.417
Not that Hugo understood a word.

02:47.417 --> 02:50.003
Hey.
-Yeah. Go ahead.

02:50.003 --> 02:54.258
As I was saying, Chad had his reasons
for suspecting Memo.

02:54.258 --> 02:55.634
HOLLYWOOD PARTY FOOTAGE

02:56.552 --> 02:58.387
Fabián must have gotten the information

02:58.387 --> 03:00.764
between his two live reports
at 6:00 and at 7:00.

03:00.764 --> 03:03.141
So I was looking through
our videographer's footage,

03:03.141 --> 03:04.309
when I saw this.

03:05.310 --> 03:07.104
Fabián and Memo together.

03:07.104 --> 03:09.773
Boom. Cracked the case. Brilliant, right?

03:09.773 --> 03:13.193
I'm like that <i>Murder, She Wrote</i> woman but,
like, a lot younger and almost as hot.

03:14.361 --> 03:15.529
I'm sorry, Máximo.

03:15.529 --> 03:17.781
I know he's your friend,
but I think Chad's right.

03:17.781 --> 03:18.991
We should make sure.

03:19.575 --> 03:23.036
We don't want to fire Memo and then
find out the real mole is still around.

03:23.662 --> 03:27.374
That's a good point.
And we are hanging out with Memo tonight.

03:27.374 --> 03:29.960
I could take charge
and get him to confess.

03:29.960 --> 03:32.754
Okay.
Take tonight to see what you can find out.

03:32.754 --> 03:35.174
But otherwise,
first thing tomorrow morning,

03:35.757 --> 03:38.260
we're firing Memo.
-Can I be the one that does it?

03:38.260 --> 03:40.971
I haven't got to fire anybody
since that gardener. Please. Please.

03:40.971 --> 03:42.973
That's a big boy job. You know that.

03:42.973 --> 03:45.893
<i>I had one night
to clear my best friend's name.</i>

03:45.893 --> 03:49.521
<i>And it was the night
of Chad and Julia's bachelor parties.</i>

03:55.444 --> 03:57.070
Okay, let's review the game plan.

03:57.070 --> 03:58.864
First, group dinner at Isabel's,

03:58.864 --> 04:00.574
then I'm playing cards with the boys,

04:00.574 --> 04:03.785
and my mom gave you girls the big suite.
Cool, right?

04:03.785 --> 04:08.707
Yeah. I'm mostly excited about dinner.
People we know, no strangers, no weirdos.

04:08.707 --> 04:10.501
Oh, my God, Chad.

04:11.335 --> 04:13.712
Kelli.
-Yes, duh. Who else?

04:15.547 --> 04:18.382
Kelli, this is--
this is-- my fiancée, Julia.

04:18.509 --> 04:19.843
Hi.
-Julia,

04:19.843 --> 04:22.679
Kelli is an-- an-- an old friend from LA.

04:22.679 --> 04:25.682
Old friend? Is that what you call a girl
you dated for two years?

04:25.682 --> 04:27.059
So, why--

04:27.059 --> 04:29.770
Okay, I was at this little retreat
up the coast, and I thought to myself,

04:29.770 --> 04:31.355
"Kelli, you have to see Chad
while you're here.

04:31.355 --> 04:33.190
I mean, how far can Acapulco really be?"

04:33.190 --> 04:36.693
Turns out it was a six-hour taxi ride.
I mean, who knew Mexico was really big?

04:36.693 --> 04:39.321
Yeah, that surprised me too.
-What a discovery you made.

04:39.321 --> 04:42.157
I had the best time
because Kyle and I have been so busy

04:42.157 --> 04:43.575
we don't have time to meditate.

04:43.575 --> 04:45.661
It was a week-long silent retreat.
Can you imagine me

04:45.661 --> 04:47.621
at a silent retreat for a week?
-I can't.

04:47.621 --> 04:50.374
I have a massage in five minutes.
Are you two free tonight? We can catch up.

04:51.166 --> 04:52.501
We-- We actually--

04:52.501 --> 04:55.128
We'd love to-- See, we have
this big dinner thing that we sh--

04:55.128 --> 04:56.296
Yeah...
-That sounds great.

04:56.296 --> 04:57.798
I can't wait to come.

04:57.798 --> 05:00.425
And I can tell that you and I
are cosmic sisters.

05:00.425 --> 05:02.427
We're gonna talk so much tonight.

05:02.427 --> 05:04.263
Yes.
-Yes.

05:04.263 --> 05:06.014
Well, one of us will at least.

05:06.932 --> 05:07.933
I am so sorry.

05:07.933 --> 05:10.894
I was gently trying to tell her,
"No, we're not free tonight."

05:10.894 --> 05:15.315
And I think that my no was so gentle
that it just-- just came out like a yes.

05:16.149 --> 05:18.485
Do you mind?
I mean, she's nutty but that's it.

05:18.485 --> 05:20.070
No, of course I don't mind.

05:20.070 --> 05:21.405
Of course I mind!

05:22.990 --> 05:23.824
Why is she even here?

05:25.033 --> 05:27.160
I trust Chad, but I don't trust her.

05:27.160 --> 05:28.453
Sara.

05:28.453 --> 05:30.205
Can you help me keep her away
from Chad tonight?

05:30.205 --> 05:32.583
Of course!
Maybe Máximo and Isabel can help, too.

05:32.708 --> 05:33.709
Thanks.

05:33.709 --> 05:35.294
Hey, and...

05:35.919 --> 05:37.629
how are those two?

05:38.338 --> 05:39.173
Well...

05:39.756 --> 05:41.675
They are always together,

05:41.675 --> 05:42.968
holding hands,

05:43.302 --> 05:45.012
laughing, kissing...

05:45.012 --> 05:46.013
It's disgusting.

05:51.268 --> 05:52.644
Ooh, I love that bracelet.

05:53.645 --> 05:54.438
You can have it.

05:55.397 --> 05:57.232
I found it when I was at the resort.

05:57.608 --> 05:58.942
Consider it my rent.

05:58.942 --> 06:00.194
Are you sure?
-Yeah.

06:03.655 --> 06:04.573
Thanks!

06:08.535 --> 06:09.369
Beautiful.

06:10.996 --> 06:12.372
<i>Meanwhile,</i>

06:12.372 --> 06:15.792
<i>Esteban's mother was having dinner
with my mom for the first time.</i>

06:18.712 --> 06:21.256
Is that the shirt
you're wearing to dinner?

06:21.507 --> 06:24.593
Yes, Mom. We're already at dinner.

06:24.593 --> 06:26.094
Can you please just try to support me?

06:26.094 --> 06:27.179
I'm sorry...

06:28.555 --> 06:31.391
I just thought
this dinner was important to you.

06:31.683 --> 06:32.935
Mom! It is.

06:33.185 --> 06:35.270
I'm really trying to impress Nora.

06:35.604 --> 06:37.606
Try to not be so negative about me
tonight?

06:37.606 --> 06:39.650
Of course, sweetie.

06:40.442 --> 06:42.736
I want this to work out, too.

06:42.736 --> 06:43.612
Thanks mom.

06:43.779 --> 06:46.823
Especially since she's way
too good for you.

06:47.157 --> 06:48.492
And because...

06:48.700 --> 06:50.160
you're getting old.

06:52.996 --> 06:53.830
I'll get it!

06:54.790 --> 06:58.043
Oh, I forgot to tell you: a friend
is stopping by for a quick visit.

07:00.504 --> 07:03.632
It's the one and only Don Pablo Bonilla!

07:03.799 --> 07:05.133
Don Pablo?

07:05.133 --> 07:06.468
Yes. Do you know each other?

07:07.094 --> 07:08.512
He doesn't know me.

07:08.512 --> 07:09.972
But I know him.

07:12.182 --> 07:13.600
Look. Catch!

07:14.017 --> 07:15.143
No, no, no.

07:15.143 --> 07:16.520
Stay away--

07:17.062 --> 07:19.314
Now there is a man
who you should be more like.

07:19.314 --> 07:21.525
Who makes his mother proud.

07:22.317 --> 07:24.736
He's handsome, responsible,

07:24.862 --> 07:26.363
Yeah, yeah, mom.

07:26.363 --> 07:27.948
respected.

07:27.948 --> 07:30.576
And helping to run Las Colinas!

07:30.951 --> 07:33.245
So much more elegant than the bus depot.

07:34.079 --> 07:37.583
I bet he doesn't come home
smelling like gasoline.

07:37.833 --> 07:39.001
He smells like...

07:40.836 --> 07:42.045
elegance!

07:44.590 --> 07:46.175
Not today Don Pablo.

07:46.508 --> 07:47.342
Not today.

07:49.553 --> 07:52.389
Don't hunch so much,
you look like a camel.

07:53.098 --> 07:56.685
Look how straight Don Pablo stands.

07:58.020 --> 07:58.854
Nora.

07:59.104 --> 08:01.773
It's not my intention
to interrupt your dinner,

08:01.773 --> 08:04.776
but I'm leaving tomorrow for Mexico City.

08:04.776 --> 08:06.695
I just want to thank you one more time...

08:07.362 --> 08:09.781
for bringing my son back into my life.

08:11.575 --> 08:12.826
They're beautiful, thank you.

08:12.826 --> 08:14.703
Flowers! What a sweet gesture!

08:14.703 --> 08:15.954
It's a shame you can't stay to eat,

08:15.954 --> 08:17.456
because it's a small gathering.

08:17.456 --> 08:18.373
Thanks.

08:18.582 --> 08:21.585
Don Pablo, please stay for dinner!

08:23.962 --> 08:25.672
I'd love to.

08:26.256 --> 08:27.090
I'll help you!

08:27.090 --> 08:28.008
Great.

08:37.558 --> 08:40.770
<i>It was finally time
for Chad and Julia's big dinner.</i>

08:40.770 --> 08:43.357
<i>It was also my last chance
to convince Chad</i>

08:43.357 --> 08:46.193
<i>that Memo was not a mole
for</i> Espectacular <i>magazine.</i>

08:46.193 --> 08:47.653
And here's the big couple!

08:47.653 --> 08:49.404
Hey.
-Chad, nice to see you.

08:50.280 --> 08:51.198
You look so nice.

08:51.740 --> 08:52.950
Welcome, guys.

08:52.950 --> 08:54.159
How have you been?

08:54.284 --> 08:55.285
How's living with Julia?

08:55.410 --> 08:56.703
It's the best!

08:56.703 --> 08:58.872
She lets me eat candy, watch TV...

09:00.123 --> 09:02.376
...and checks my homework
and turns the lights out at eight

09:02.376 --> 09:04.711
and makes me brush my teeth
six times a day.

09:05.587 --> 09:06.964
I'm glad you're all right.

09:07.798 --> 09:11.301
I guess you're not coming
home anytime soon.

09:12.219 --> 09:14.137
Not until Mom accepts who I am.

09:14.471 --> 09:17.474
Plus, now I get to go out
and party with all of you!

09:18.016 --> 09:19.768
Exactly! Super!

09:19.893 --> 09:20.727
So great!

09:21.728 --> 09:23.522
Please, do not let her drink.
-I got this.

09:23.522 --> 09:28.235
Hey, so, my ex-girlfriend
Kelli sort of invited herself here.

09:28.735 --> 09:30.529
Do you mind keeping her away from Julia?

09:30.529 --> 09:33.240
I can just tell that she doesn't wanna
deal with her tonight.

09:33.240 --> 09:34.408
You got it.

09:34.408 --> 09:35.784
Lifesaver.

09:36.577 --> 09:37.578
Okay, "hermigo,"

09:38.245 --> 09:40.080
tonight we got some work to do, all right?

09:40.080 --> 09:43.584
If Memo did leak information to Expac--

09:44.418 --> 09:46.461
Ex-spatula--
-<i>Espectacular.</i>

09:46.461 --> 09:47.713
That's where I was headed.

09:47.713 --> 09:49.923
Okay, that means
he has a lot more money now.

09:49.923 --> 09:52.509
And he's too smart
to just be flaunting it, okay?

09:52.509 --> 09:56.597
So we have to look very carefully
for the tiniest signs of wealth,

09:56.597 --> 09:58.599
the slightest hint of prosperity.

09:58.599 --> 10:02.269
Hey, everybody. Look at my fancy new suit.

10:03.353 --> 10:05.230
Ooh, Memo!

10:06.607 --> 10:09.151
Looking sharp, buddy.
-Thank you.

10:09.151 --> 10:12.821
You won't believe how much I paid for this
when I bought it.

10:14.198 --> 10:15.407
I didn't buy it!

10:15.657 --> 10:18.035
My cousin just died.
I got all his clothes!

10:24.124 --> 10:25.250
New to town?

10:25.250 --> 10:27.169
I'd be happy to show you
all the hot spots.

10:27.169 --> 10:29.671
My bedroom district, for example...

10:30.547 --> 10:31.590
I'm married.

10:31.590 --> 10:34.635
I won't tell him if you don't.
-You're bad.

10:34.635 --> 10:37.387
Nah, I am the best you'll ever have.

10:43.894 --> 10:45.020
Hey!

10:49.316 --> 10:52.819
<i>Chicos,</i> who is ready to get crazy, hey?

10:53.529 --> 10:55.072
I am, I am.

10:55.072 --> 10:58.367
Flaquito, next round's on me!

11:02.955 --> 11:04.873
I just found some cash in the pocket!

11:05.499 --> 11:07.334
<i>And so the night began.</i>

11:07.334 --> 11:09.878
<i>Chad was trying to prove
that Memo was the mole.</i>

11:10.462 --> 11:13.048
<i>I was trying to get Chad off Memo's scent.</i>

11:13.632 --> 11:16.635
<i>Sara was trying to keep Kelli away
from Chad.</i>

11:16.635 --> 11:19.513
<i>Isabel was trying to keep Kelli away
from Julia.</i>

11:19.513 --> 11:21.849
<i>Héctor was trying to seduce Kelli.</i>

11:21.849 --> 11:25.352
<i>And Memo just seemed intent
on digging his own grave.</i>

11:31.233 --> 11:35.237
Okay, my cosmic sister, spill it.
When did you know that Chad was the one?

11:35.237 --> 11:36.196
Well, I--

11:36.196 --> 11:38.490
Because for me and Kyle,
it was, like, instant fireworks.

11:38.490 --> 11:42.411
Oh, my God, you would love Kyle so much.
And he and I are totally different too.

11:42.411 --> 11:44.496
Like, he's from Encino,
I'm from Santa Monica,

11:44.496 --> 11:45.831
and we love each other. So--

11:45.831 --> 11:48.792
Kelli, Chad really wants to talk to you.

11:49.835 --> 11:50.752
I'll tell Chad about Kyle.

11:51.336 --> 11:52.337
Wait--

11:52.337 --> 11:53.422
Isa, no.

11:54.840 --> 11:57.718
Hey, boys.
-Hey, let's all order some food, right?

11:57.718 --> 12:02.139
Sure, yeah, great idea.
Does anybody wanna get the mole?

12:02.723 --> 12:04.057
Mole?
-What?

12:04.808 --> 12:05.976
Memo?

12:07.394 --> 12:08.395
You mean <i>mole</i>.

12:09.104 --> 12:10.147
You know what?

12:10.147 --> 12:12.107
It's your day, your party.

12:12.107 --> 12:13.609
I'll use your pronunciation.

12:13.609 --> 12:18.488
I love mole. Mole, mole, mole. That's me.

12:18.488 --> 12:22.159
Sometimes I have so much mole,
you can call me Mr. Mole.

12:25.495 --> 12:27.748
That guy's a funny one.
-This guy's a funny one.

12:27.748 --> 12:30.751
Oh, my God. We just said the same thing
at the same time.

12:30.751 --> 12:34.379
It's like you can read my mind.
-I can. I'm a third-level empath.

12:34.379 --> 12:35.756
Wow.
-I know.

12:36.673 --> 12:38.008
What is empath?

12:38.467 --> 12:41.386
Okay, so, Chad,
now, we are mixing metals here, honey.

12:41.386 --> 12:43.555
You can't do gold and silver
on the same arm.

12:43.555 --> 12:44.598
Really?
-Sara.

12:45.015 --> 12:46.266
Bring Kelli back here!

12:46.558 --> 12:47.518
Move it!

12:47.518 --> 12:49.228
<i>Now, back then, your mom's English</i>

12:49.228 --> 12:51.855
<i>was a lot like your Spanish,</i> no bueno.

12:51.855 --> 12:55.567
<i>All she could remember were the sentences
she'd had to learn for English class.</i>

12:55.567 --> 12:57.110
Hi.
-Hi.

12:57.778 --> 12:58.654
What is your name?

12:59.404 --> 13:01.031
Kelli. What's your name?

13:03.158 --> 13:04.910
I have a yellow pencil.

13:06.036 --> 13:07.788
I don't know how to respond to that.

13:08.288 --> 13:10.582
Come over here.
-Okay, okay. Okay.

13:10.582 --> 13:12.084
I'm so popular.

13:13.085 --> 13:16.547
So, Memo,
you confess to mole-like activities?

13:17.506 --> 13:19.091
Guilty as charged.

13:19.091 --> 13:20.634
"Guilty as charged."

13:21.134 --> 13:23.762
So do you meditate too,
or is that more Chad's thing?

13:23.762 --> 13:25.806
It's not really either of our thing.

13:25.806 --> 13:27.182
Really? That's weird.

13:27.182 --> 13:29.643
I mean, back when we were together,
he was so into it.

13:29.643 --> 13:32.187
I mean, it was as much part of him
as being a vegetarian.

13:34.898 --> 13:36.483
They got the best steak here.

13:37.943 --> 13:40.445
Will you excuse me for a second?
-Yeah. I'll come too.

13:40.445 --> 13:42.322
Okay. That was fun.

13:42.948 --> 13:44.241
No, Sara.

13:44.241 --> 13:45.659
Memo. Memo.

13:45.659 --> 13:48.787
So tasty, the fat and the gristle.
-I need to talk to you.

13:48.787 --> 13:49.955
Hey.

13:51.748 --> 13:55.586
How come I've never heard
about this whole meditation thing?

13:56.670 --> 13:59.256
You tell me. I mean,
it's been around for a thousand years.

13:59.256 --> 14:01.049
That's not what I meant, baby.

14:01.049 --> 14:02.968
Máximo, next round's on you.

14:03.468 --> 14:05.095
Stop bringing attention to yourself.

14:05.220 --> 14:07.139
What are you talking about?
-Don't freak out.

14:07.306 --> 14:08.932
I won't freak out.

14:08.932 --> 14:11.685
Diane and Chad think you're the
secret agent from Espectacular.

14:11.894 --> 14:12.936
What?! No!

14:13.312 --> 14:14.354
I AM FREAKING OUT!

14:15.022 --> 14:15.856
Máximo.

14:15.856 --> 14:18.108
Oh my God, I called myself "Mr. Mole"!

14:18.108 --> 14:19.234
They're gonna fire me!

14:19.234 --> 14:20.986
What will I do for money?

14:21.236 --> 14:22.946
I'll have to sell this suit,

14:22.946 --> 14:24.072
these shoes,

14:24.072 --> 14:25.657
maybe even my body--

14:25.657 --> 14:28.076
Calm down. I know you're not the mole.

14:28.076 --> 14:29.161
I'm going to help you out
in front of Chad.

14:29.161 --> 14:31.205
When I ask why they
saw you with Fabián Solares,

14:31.622 --> 14:32.497
just tell the truth:

14:32.497 --> 14:35.000
He came up to you, but you didn't
want anything to do with him.

14:35.542 --> 14:36.460
Okay.

14:36.460 --> 14:38.545
He came up to me, but I didn't
want anything to do with him.

14:38.545 --> 14:39.588
Easy.
-Easy.

14:40.047 --> 14:41.048
Okay.

14:41.840 --> 14:42.925
Oh, no, Máximo.

14:42.925 --> 14:43.842
I'm so nervous.

14:44.343 --> 14:45.177
Breathe.

14:45.177 --> 14:46.929
Okay.

14:48.847 --> 14:51.475
Don't worry, babe.
The meditation thing was just a phase.

14:51.475 --> 14:52.893
Like when I went brunette.

14:54.061 --> 14:58.815
Which I w-- I will also tell you about,
but tonight, let's just have fun, okay?

14:59.316 --> 15:02.027
Okay. I'll be right back.

15:03.654 --> 15:04.738
Hey.
-What?

15:04.905 --> 15:05.822
Who is that girl?

15:06.406 --> 15:07.533
That's Kelli-- Chad's ex.

15:07.533 --> 15:08.617
Chad?

15:09.493 --> 15:11.453
Damn. Not sure if I
can do that to him again.

15:11.912 --> 15:13.205
Do what to who again?

15:14.540 --> 15:15.791
Nothing! Don't worry.

15:15.791 --> 15:18.126
I've already decided to do it again.

15:18.126 --> 15:19.419
So here's our plan.

15:19.711 --> 15:23.090
You ask Kelli how she is,

15:23.090 --> 15:28.428
then whatever she answers, you say,

15:28.762 --> 15:29.972
"That reminds me,

15:29.972 --> 15:33.517
the most impressive
thing about Héctor's anatomy is his"--

15:33.517 --> 15:34.893
Héctor I'm not doing any of that.

15:35.102 --> 15:37.062
Please, Julia. Help me help you...

15:37.354 --> 15:38.564
Help me.

15:39.481 --> 15:41.108
I need a win tonight.

15:41.567 --> 15:43.527
And that win's name is Katy.

15:44.236 --> 15:45.070
Kelli.

15:45.988 --> 15:48.323
And that win's name is Kelli.

15:50.117 --> 15:51.702
You got this.
-I got this.

15:56.582 --> 16:00.460
Memo, did we see you
with Fabián Solares last night?

16:00.460 --> 16:03.547
Well, the thing that I honestly
about last night

16:03.547 --> 16:05.424
is the thing that I truly believe
is the yes.

16:05.424 --> 16:07.259
And, you know, sometimes I just go

16:07.259 --> 16:10.095
and I do things that I don't really mean,
but they happen.

16:10.095 --> 16:11.722
And it's okay. It's okay, you know?

16:11.722 --> 16:14.224
Because that is life.
That's what life is all about.

16:14.224 --> 16:17.895
Life is about going and taking chances
and making mistakes,

16:17.895 --> 16:20.105
but you don't really mean
to make those mistakes.

16:20.105 --> 16:22.065
And I always do the right thing,

16:22.065 --> 16:26.653
which is doing what's best for the hotel,
which I never don't do.

16:26.653 --> 16:28.280
And-- And that's innocence. Yeah.

16:29.489 --> 16:31.116
Memo, big spender.

16:32.701 --> 16:34.286
How'd I do? Did I convince him?

16:34.286 --> 16:35.537
Oh, you convinced him.

16:43.504 --> 16:46.131
I'm getting serious vibes
from one of the boys over there.

16:46.131 --> 16:48.884
So weird. I'm married. I'm happily
married. Already told him that.

16:48.884 --> 16:52.804
I'm really, really happily married.
Like, really, really happily married.

16:53.889 --> 16:56.642
Maybe I should tell him I'm really
happily married, just to be safe.

16:56.642 --> 16:58.227
Oh, no, no, no.

16:58.227 --> 17:00.562
My cat is on the bed.

17:01.313 --> 17:02.898
I really wish I knew what you meant.

17:04.858 --> 17:05.983
Do you want a drink?

17:07.694 --> 17:09.613
Which way is the library?

17:09.613 --> 17:10.696
Yes!

17:11.281 --> 17:15.536
Wait, Máximo. Are you sure that Sara would
want you to tell him about this next part?

17:15.536 --> 17:16.703
Good point.

17:17.287 --> 17:19.998
Hugo, after having trouble
talking all night,

17:19.998 --> 17:24.627
your mom and Kelli found the one thing
they could bond over.

17:25.462 --> 17:27.339
Orange juice!

17:27.339 --> 17:30.551
<i>Come on.
I know what they were really drinking.</i>

17:30.551 --> 17:35.264
<i>Look, I'm telling the story
and I'm saying it was orange juice.</i>

17:37.307 --> 17:38.976
...and I told him,

17:39.768 --> 17:43.105
"I don't care what country
elected you president...

17:43.897 --> 17:46.567
In our pool, no one swims naked."

17:47.818 --> 17:49.069
Well said.

17:49.236 --> 17:50.904
Something similar happened to me

17:51.071 --> 17:53.198
but instead of a president
it was a drunk guy,

17:53.198 --> 17:54.908
and instead of a pool
it was at the bus depot.

17:55.200 --> 17:57.494
Again with the bus depot.

17:57.661 --> 18:00.455
You know, my son didn't
always want to be a mechanic.

18:00.747 --> 18:02.416
He used to want to be a luchador.

18:02.416 --> 18:04.585
Well, mom I'm sure no one is interested.

18:05.502 --> 18:07.713
Every little boy wants to be a
luchador when they grow up.

18:07.713 --> 18:10.924
Oh, sure, but this was when he was 28.

18:10.924 --> 18:12.384
He called himself

18:12.384 --> 18:14.845
"The Avenging Squirrel!"

18:15.554 --> 18:17.097
Mom! Can I talk to you?

18:17.264 --> 18:18.765
Of course you can.

18:19.266 --> 18:20.100
What about?

18:21.393 --> 18:22.227
Excuse us.

18:23.687 --> 18:26.607
You must be excited for your vacation.

18:26.815 --> 18:27.858
Tell Víctor I said hello.

18:28.817 --> 18:29.860
It's not a vacation.

18:30.611 --> 18:31.737
I'm moving there.

18:33.530 --> 18:34.656
You're leaving Acapulco?

18:35.449 --> 18:37.075
It's time for me to be
with my family more.

18:37.993 --> 18:39.620
All the arguments we've had in the past...

18:39.953 --> 18:41.580
they all seem small now.

18:42.873 --> 18:45.834
I don't want to waste any more time
away from my son and grandchild.

18:47.461 --> 18:49.379
Family is what's most important.

18:50.547 --> 18:53.550
Thank you for helping me remember that.

18:54.760 --> 18:56.553
I am very glad.

19:05.646 --> 19:07.523
Sorry. I just had to have a
quick talk with my mom.

19:07.523 --> 19:09.691
Don Pablo, I wish my son
were more like you.

19:09.691 --> 19:11.568
He's too sensitive!

19:11.944 --> 19:13.403
Mom, can we talk again!

19:13.612 --> 19:16.031
Now, what is this about?

19:19.076 --> 19:20.410
<i>Back at the restaurant,</i>

19:20.410 --> 19:23.121
<i>Sara and Kelli kept pounding orange juice.</i>

19:23.121 --> 19:24.665
<i>Everyone else kept partying.</i>

19:24.665 --> 19:28.752
<i>And I told Isabel everything
about my troubles with</i> Espectacular<i>.</i>

19:28.752 --> 19:31.046
They might fire Memo for something I did.

19:31.046 --> 19:32.840
And now I'm not sure how to fix all this.

19:33.340 --> 19:34.383
I feel terrible.

19:34.383 --> 19:35.676
I hate who I'm becoming
because of the hotel.

19:37.386 --> 19:39.137
Sorry for dumping this on you.

19:39.137 --> 19:41.265
Normally, I go to Don Pablo
for advice, but he quit.

19:43.141 --> 19:44.142
Well...

19:45.686 --> 19:47.646
Maybe, Don Pablo still has the answer.

19:48.939 --> 19:49.773
How?

19:51.149 --> 19:52.943
Resign from Las Colinas.

19:53.443 --> 19:55.237
If you don't like who you
are becoming there,

19:55.237 --> 19:56.405
come work here.

19:57.489 --> 19:58.699
Everything would be easier.

20:00.534 --> 20:01.910
<i>Isabel was right.</i>

20:02.911 --> 20:06.790
<i>If I quit Las Colinas,
it would solve all my problems.</i>

20:08.125 --> 20:10.961
<i>Hugo, in that moment,</i>

20:11.628 --> 20:15.257
<i>I saw my future
there at the restaurant with Isabel.</i>

20:20.888 --> 20:24.349
Isabel had given me
the solution that I'd been looking for,

20:24.349 --> 20:25.434
but...

20:27.102 --> 20:28.270
could I do it?

20:30.564 --> 20:33.442
I don't know.
I wish the universe would show me a sign.

20:34.401 --> 20:35.903
Signs don't exist, Máximo.

20:36.278 --> 20:37.654
There's this way and that way.

20:38.697 --> 20:40.699
The universe doesn't give
a damn which one you pick.

20:41.825 --> 20:43.827
I'll tell Flaquito to bring out the cake.

20:46.205 --> 20:48.624
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
And I didn't even notice.

20:48.624 --> 20:51.919
I didn't even notice
my hair was stuck in the door!

20:51.919 --> 20:54.755
Can I use the telephone?
-I know, I know.

20:54.755 --> 20:57.799
And that was the last time I ever took
that vitamin supplement.

20:57.799 --> 21:01.553
Let's go to the post office.
-Yes, so true.

21:02.346 --> 21:04.056
Wow, you two hit it off, huh?

21:04.056 --> 21:05.766
Yeah, this is so fun.

21:07.184 --> 21:08.560
I never have fun like this.

21:09.561 --> 21:11.438
Sara. Sara.

21:11.605 --> 21:12.481
Have you been drinking?

21:12.648 --> 21:13.607
Yes.
-Yes.

21:13.607 --> 21:15.192
Just a little orange juice...

21:15.192 --> 21:17.152
mixed with apple juice.

21:17.528 --> 21:19.446
Ooh, and a shot of cranberry juice--

21:19.738 --> 21:20.697
that stuff is strong!

21:20.697 --> 21:21.698
Oh my God.

21:21.698 --> 21:24.117
I'm not happy in my marriage.

21:24.117 --> 21:26.119
All right, Memo. Enough is enough.

21:26.119 --> 21:28.163
Look me in the eyes and tell me the truth.

21:28.163 --> 21:32.167
Were you the one selling secrets
to Expat-- Expark--

21:32.167 --> 21:33.877
<i>Espectacular</i>?
-So it was you!

21:33.877 --> 21:36.713
No, no. I swear it wasn't me.
I don't know any secrets.

21:36.713 --> 21:38.048
I bet.
-And if I did,

21:38.048 --> 21:42.553
I would keep them to myself.
I have a lot of secrets that I keep.

21:43.053 --> 21:46.056
Lupe doesn't know how to swim.
Beto was a teen pop star.

21:46.056 --> 21:47.808
Diane had an affair with--
-What?

21:48.559 --> 21:50.978
Affair? With who?

21:50.978 --> 21:52.604
We're just not connected.

21:52.604 --> 21:55.190
But I thought Kyle was the one.
-Yeah, the one who sucks.

21:55.190 --> 21:57.234
There are so many things
he didn't tell me about him,

21:57.234 --> 21:58.527
and there's nothing worse

21:58.527 --> 22:01.029
than marrying someone
and then finding out who they are.

22:01.029 --> 22:04.324
I mean, if you have any doubt,
do not get married.

22:05.492 --> 22:06.785
Have you been drinking juice?

22:07.327 --> 22:08.620
You're too young to drink fruit!

22:09.663 --> 22:10.956
Don't tell Máximo.

22:11.540 --> 22:12.624
I'm confused.

22:12.624 --> 22:15.210
Did I say affair? I meant to say affair.

22:15.210 --> 22:17.254
Wait, that's the same word.
-Yeah.

22:17.254 --> 22:20.132
Look, Chad.
Your mom's affair was not serious.

22:20.132 --> 22:24.428
In fact, it was meaningless.
It was with nobody, and it meant nothing.

22:25.012 --> 22:27.222
Nobody and nothing. Nothing and no--

22:27.347 --> 22:28.765
It was with me!

22:29.558 --> 22:31.560
And it meant everything.

22:32.853 --> 22:36.064
You son of a bitch.
-No, no. Please! Stop! Stop.

22:36.064 --> 22:37.649
Héctor, to make it even,

22:37.649 --> 22:39.568
maybe Chad should sleep with your mom.
-Ha!

22:39.568 --> 22:41.695
What?!
-Wait, no. That's a bad idea.

22:41.695 --> 22:43.906
We're supposed to be soul mates
and I don't even know him.

22:43.906 --> 22:46.658
Don't I deserve someone
who's thoughtful and charming?

22:52.289 --> 22:56.293
<i>Hugo,
I had thrown that bracelet into the ocean,</i>

22:56.293 --> 23:00.881
<i>but somehow the universe brought it back.</i>

23:09.598 --> 23:12.017
I can't believe you had sex with my mom.

23:12.017 --> 23:14.561
No, I swear, Chad. We never had sex.

23:15.145 --> 23:16.605
We made love.

24:01.900 --> 24:03.360
I'll be right back.

24:12.369 --> 24:13.370
Máximo.

24:13.370 --> 24:14.454
Are you okay?

24:15.163 --> 24:16.665
Where did you get that bracelet?

24:17.457 --> 24:19.418
Your sister found it in the pool.

24:19.918 --> 24:20.919
It's lovely.

24:21.420 --> 24:22.838
I love what's written inside it.

24:23.797 --> 24:25.591
"Happiness is this."

24:26.425 --> 24:27.259
How do you know?

24:28.010 --> 24:29.136
It's Virginia Woolf.

24:30.554 --> 24:32.681
"He could not tell her he loved her.

24:33.182 --> 24:34.725
He held her hand.

24:35.726 --> 24:37.436
Happiness is this, he thought."

24:38.812 --> 24:40.314
I bought it for you.

24:43.358 --> 24:45.527
Good night.

24:45.694 --> 24:47.571
Mom, I'm going to help Nora clean up.

24:47.571 --> 24:50.073
You go ahead, I'll see you at home.

24:50.490 --> 24:52.743
I'd be happy to walk you home.

24:54.328 --> 24:57.998
I'm being walked home
by Don Pablo Bonilla?

24:57.998 --> 24:59.833
I wish I lived farther away!

24:59.833 --> 25:01.043
Have a good trip.

25:01.043 --> 25:02.211
Thank you!

25:07.049 --> 25:08.509
I'm sorry about my mom.

25:09.551 --> 25:10.552
Esteban.

25:11.929 --> 25:13.180
I know your mom can be...

25:13.472 --> 25:14.806
tough on you.

25:15.766 --> 25:17.935
But you've become exactly the

25:17.935 --> 25:21.146
honest, hardworking, handsome man

25:21.146 --> 25:23.273
she always wanted you to be.

25:23.774 --> 25:24.816
You mean that?

25:25.484 --> 25:26.777
I'm asking because...

25:27.528 --> 25:29.446
it's not too late--

25:29.696 --> 25:31.031
You're an incredible woman.

25:31.406 --> 25:32.783
You could easily find yourself

25:33.075 --> 25:34.618
a successful man like Don Pablo.

25:35.702 --> 25:37.246
And why do I want a successful man?

25:37.788 --> 25:38.789
If I already have

25:38.789 --> 25:40.707
The Avenging Squirrel!

25:45.254 --> 25:47.506
What have I done? I have a husband.

25:48.006 --> 25:49.341
That's nothing.

25:49.341 --> 25:51.260
I have a long-distance girlfriend.

25:51.260 --> 25:53.178
I am a horrible wife.

25:53.846 --> 25:55.931
You're not.
-Really, you don't think so?

25:57.474 --> 26:00.811
No, what are you doing? You are horrible.

26:02.646 --> 26:04.147
I want to go home now.

26:04.773 --> 26:06.984
Okay. I'll take you to Julia's.

26:07.484 --> 26:08.569
No, to my--

26:10.696 --> 26:12.489
Right, to Julia's.

26:13.490 --> 26:16.243
Punch me as hard and as much as you want.

26:16.243 --> 26:18.370
No one can hurt me like your mother did.

26:19.162 --> 26:21.081
Hold on, she hurt you?
-So much.

26:21.665 --> 26:24.293
If only she understood
the pain she made me suffer.

26:25.169 --> 26:28.172
So you really can't get over
what she did to you, huh?

26:29.381 --> 26:31.633
You wish you could
get back at her somehow?

26:34.845 --> 26:37.556
Don't worry, buddy.
Your suffering will be over soon enough.

26:40.225 --> 26:42.728
I would have been
such a good father to you.

26:45.397 --> 26:48.692
I bought that bracelet for
you last year, after we kissed.

26:49.359 --> 26:52.112
But when you got engaged,
I threw it into the ocean.

26:57.075 --> 26:58.744
Why didn't you tell me how you felt?!

26:59.536 --> 27:01.205
I tried to talk to you after New Year's,

27:01.455 --> 27:03.040
but, it was like
you didn't even care about us.

27:03.040 --> 27:04.208
I've always cared.

27:04.374 --> 27:05.501
But you said yes to Chad.

27:06.168 --> 27:07.711
I had to forget my feelings,

27:08.212 --> 27:09.046
our kiss...

27:10.881 --> 27:12.341
I should have forgotten. But I couldn't.

27:12.341 --> 27:13.967
We said it never happened.

27:13.967 --> 27:14.885
Of course it happened!

27:14.885 --> 27:17.554
It happened and I can never
forget that moment.

27:23.393 --> 27:24.520
...I can't either.

27:25.979 --> 27:27.147
Everything all right?

27:28.148 --> 27:30.859
Yes. Yeah, just catching up.

27:30.859 --> 27:33.362
Guys, this is crazy,
but do we call it a night?

27:33.362 --> 27:34.696
Yeah.
-Yes.

27:36.532 --> 27:39.868
Wait a minute. That moment with Julia
happened right outside the restaurant.

27:39.868 --> 27:41.703
And we were outside the restaurant

27:41.703 --> 27:44.498
when you asked Joe to check
if the mystery person was home.

27:44.498 --> 27:46.208
Was it? Who can remember?

27:46.208 --> 27:47.334
Yes!

27:47.334 --> 27:50.879
The person you're avoiding
isn't Isabel, it's Julia.

27:50.879 --> 27:52.589
That's the person
you're thinking of seeing.

27:52.589 --> 27:54.883
I think it's time
for your uncle to tell you about--

27:55.467 --> 27:56.802
I said no spoilers.

27:57.386 --> 27:58.387
Okay.

27:59.930 --> 28:01.014
Is-- Is that--

28:01.014 --> 28:05.519
This bracelet was the universe showing me
the sign that I'd been looking for.

28:06.103 --> 28:09.439
Because of it, Julia and I
confessed our feelings for each other.

28:09.439 --> 28:12.776
But what could we do?

28:14.653 --> 28:15.654
Bye.

28:16.697 --> 28:19.825
<i>Meanwhile,
Chad was now more certain than ever</i>

28:19.825 --> 28:23.370
<i>that he had also found
who he was looking for.</i>

28:23.370 --> 28:26.123
Dude, what the heck was this party?

28:27.624 --> 28:29.918
All right, Memo. You're off the hook.

28:30.669 --> 28:33.714
I know who the real mole is.
It's so obvious.

28:33.714 --> 28:36.008
He had time and a motive.

28:37.384 --> 28:38.594
It has to be Héctor.

28:40.888 --> 28:42.931
Chad, I have to admit...

28:45.225 --> 28:47.311
that makes a lot of sense.
