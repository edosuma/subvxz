10:13.367 --> 10:15.967
PLASTERED ALL OVER
PHILADELPHIA?

10:17.367 --> 10:21.300
THE JOB PAYS $50.
IF THEY LIKE YOU,

10:21.300 --> 10:23.734
I CAN GET YOU MORE
THE NEXT TIME.

10:23.734 --> 10:24.734
YOU'RE SERIOUS?

10:24.734 --> 10:26.400
THIS IS A REAL
MODELING JOB?

10:26.400 --> 10:28.967
HEY, EITHER YOU WANT IT
OR YOUR DON'T.

10:28.967 --> 10:30.800
YOU'RE NOT THE ONLY
GORGEOUS GUY

10:30.800 --> 10:34.300
WITH BIG HAZEL EYES
HERE AT THE MALL.

10:34.300 --> 10:35.400
HEH HEH.

10:35.400 --> 10:36.867
ACTUALLY,
THEY'RE BROWN,

10:36.867 --> 10:41.667
BUT KIND OF
A HAZELY BROWN.

10:41.667 --> 10:43.467
YOU KNOW WHAT THE TOUGH THING IS
ABOUT BEING MARRIED?

10:43.467 --> 10:47.300
ACTUALLY
<i>BEING </i>MARRIED?

10:47.300 --> 10:48.300
YEAH, THAT...

10:48.300 --> 10:50.400
AND LEARNING TO BE
THE TYPE OF HUSBAND

10:50.400 --> 10:51.767
YOUR WIFE
WANTS YOU TO BE.

10:51.767 --> 10:55.200
WERE YOU GOING TO SAY
SOMETHING, SWEETHEART?

10:55.200 --> 10:59.567
HEH. NOT FOR THE LAST
18 YEARS, DARLING.

11:01.867 --> 11:03.500
HEY, YOU GET
YOUR MONEY BACK?

11:03.500 --> 11:06.000
BETTER THAN THAT.
I GOT A CAREER.

11:06.000 --> 11:07.233
EXCUSE ME?

11:07.233 --> 11:09.200
LOOK, DAD, WE'VE SPENT
A LOT OF GREAT TIMES TOGETHER,

11:09.200 --> 11:11.300
AND I'LL NEVER FORGET
HOW WELL YOU TREATED ME.

11:11.300 --> 11:13.934
SON, ARE WE BREAKING UP?

11:13.934 --> 11:16.133
WELL, ACTUALLY, I'M LEAVING
MY JOB AT THE STORE.

11:16.133 --> 11:17.567
I GOT MY FIRST JOB
AS A MODEL.

11:17.567 --> 11:19.300
IT'S JUST
THE BEGINNING FOR ME.

11:19.300 --> 11:23.133
I'M, UH, GIVING YOU
YOUR APRON BACK.

11:24.500 --> 11:26.667
THANKS FOR TAKING IT
SO WELL, DAD.

11:28.600 --> 11:29.834
"DON'T DO ANYTHING.

11:29.834 --> 11:32.133
LET HIM WORK IT OUT
FOR HIMSELF."

11:32.133 --> 11:33.200
FABULOUS.

11:33.200 --> 11:35.500
HE WAS SUPPOSED TO REALIZE
HIS OWN MISTAKE.

11:35.500 --> 11:38.600
NO, NO, DON'T EVEN THINK
ABOUT IT, SWEETHEART.

11:38.600 --> 11:39.934
SIT BACK. DO NOTHING.

11:39.934 --> 11:41.834
WE'VE RAISED
THE PERFECT TEENAGE BOY.

11:41.834 --> 11:44.467
HE'S QUITE CAPABLE
OF RUNNING HIS OWN LIFE.

11:44.467 --> 11:48.800
ALAN...I'M LETTING YOU
OUT OF YOUR CAGE.

11:48.800 --> 11:50.734
THANK YOU!

11:53.100 --> 11:54.934
[MUSIC PLAYING]

11:54.934 --> 11:57.700
<i>Dad: ERIC, YOU ARE NOT </i>
<i>GOING TO QUIT A STEADY JOB </i>

11:57.700 --> 11:58.734
<i>FOR ONE </i>
<i>MODELING ASSIGNMENT. </i>

11:58.734 --> 12:00.700
I'M SURE IF YOU REALLY
THINK THIS THROUGH,

12:00.700 --> 12:01.767
YOU WILL REALIZE

12:01.767 --> 12:04.200
THAT THIS IS NOT SOMETHING
YOU REALLY WANT.

12:04.200 --> 12:05.567
I'VE THOUGHT.
I WANT.

12:05.567 --> 12:07.100
WHEN?
WHEN DID YOU THINK,

12:07.100 --> 12:08.600
IN THE 10 SECONDS
SINCE YOU GOT HOME?

12:08.600 --> 12:11.400
THAT IS NOT THE WAY YOU MAKE
AN IMPORTANT DECISION

12:11.400 --> 12:12.834
THAT WILL CHANGE
YOUR LIFE.

12:12.834 --> 12:14.734
YOU WANT TO MAKE
AN IMPORTANT DECISION?

12:14.734 --> 12:16.734
YOU CONSIDER
EVERY ASPECT OF IT.

12:16.734 --> 12:19.834
AND AFTER YOU HAVE THOROUGHLY
THOUGHT THIS THROUGH,

12:19.834 --> 12:23.867
THEN, AND ONLY THEN,
BECAUSE I AM CONFIDENT

12:23.867 --> 12:25.467
IN THE WAY
YOU WERE BROUGHT UP,

12:25.467 --> 12:29.400
I WILL SUPPORT YOU
IN WHAT YOU WANT TO DO.

12:31.867 --> 12:36.400
I WANT TO BE
A SUPERMODEL.

12:36.400 --> 12:37.834
DOH!

12:44.233 --> 12:45.233
OK.

12:45.233 --> 12:46.233
REALLY?

12:46.233 --> 12:47.233
REALLY?

12:47.233 --> 12:48.233
YES, REALLY.

12:48.233 --> 12:49.567
I AM NOT
THE TYPE OF FATHER

12:49.567 --> 12:51.700
WHO DISMISSES HIS SON'S
WELL-CONSIDERED ASPIRATIONS

12:51.700 --> 12:55.600
WITH SOME QUICKLY TOSSED-OFF
PARENTAL NEGATIVITY.

12:55.600 --> 12:56.667
THAT'S IT?

12:56.667 --> 12:58.100
SHUT UP!

12:58.100 --> 13:01.600
YOU ARE THE GREATEST
PARENTS IN THE WORLD!

13:01.600 --> 13:03.000
DAD, YOU'RE GONNA
LET HIM

13:03.000 --> 13:04.767
JUST WALK AWAY
LIKE THAT?

13:04.767 --> 13:06.500
I JUST DID, DIDN'T I?

13:06.500 --> 13:08.934
YES, HE DID,
AND YOU KNOW WHY?

13:08.934 --> 13:11.133
BECAUSE YOUR FATHER
HAS DECIDED

13:11.133 --> 13:13.367
TO TRUST HIS CHILDREN.

13:13.367 --> 13:14.367
LOOK, DAD,

13:14.367 --> 13:16.200
I KNOW SOMETHING
ABOUT BEING A FATHER.

13:16.200 --> 13:18.200
AND I KNOW THAT
THIS PLAN OF YOURS

13:18.200 --> 13:19.367
CANNOT POSSIBLY WORK.

13:19.367 --> 13:21.233
IF I RAN MY
SCHOOL FAMILY LIKE THAT,

13:21.233 --> 13:22.467
I'D GET AN "F."

13:22.467 --> 13:24.734
DON'T YOU SEE ERIC'S
MAKING A HUGE MISTAKE?

13:24.734 --> 13:27.000
COREY, LET ME TELL YOU
SOMETHING ABOUT BEING A FATHER.

13:27.000 --> 13:29.600
UM, IT DOESN'T MATTER
IF YOU SEE IT OR I SEE IT.

13:29.600 --> 13:32.133
IT ONLY MATTERS
THAT HE DOESN'T SEE IT.

13:32.133 --> 13:33.133
WELL, IN THAT CASE,

13:33.133 --> 13:34.934
CAN I SPEND THE NIGHT
AT SHAWN'S?

13:34.934 --> 13:36.200
IT'S A SCHOOL NIGHT.

13:36.200 --> 13:38.300
YEAH, BUT I DON'T
SEE THAT, DAD.

13:38.300 --> 13:42.100
ONLY YOU SEE THAT.

13:42.100 --> 13:44.867
WELL, DO YOU
SEE THIS?

13:46.200 --> 13:47.200
YOU KNOW, DAD,

13:47.200 --> 13:49.233
THOSE AREN'T VERY
CLEAR-CUT RULES.

13:49.233 --> 13:51.233
KIND OF A DOUBLE
STANDARD GOING ON.

13:51.233 --> 13:52.834
IF YOU KEEP
CHANGING THE RULES,

13:52.834 --> 13:55.967
HOW AM I GONNA LEARN HOW
TO BE A MODEL FATHER?

13:55.967 --> 13:58.467
ASK YOUR WIFE.

14:03.033 --> 14:05.000
SO, THIS FAMILY'S
CRISIS--

14:05.000 --> 14:08.033
THE OLDER,
COOLER BROTHER

14:08.033 --> 14:09.700
WANTS TO GET
A TATTOO.

14:09.700 --> 14:11.233
CONFLICTS ABOUND.

14:11.233 --> 14:12.367
TAKE IT AWAY,

14:12.367 --> 14:14.600
YOUNGER,
UNCOOL BROTHER.

14:14.600 --> 14:16.834
I CAN'T FATHOM
WHY ANY HUMAN BEING

14:16.834 --> 14:18.467
IN FULL POSSESSION
OF HIS FACULTIES

14:18.467 --> 14:21.133
WOULD WANT TO RENDER HIMSELF
PERMANENTLY DISFIGURED

14:21.133 --> 14:24.700
WITH SO-CALLED
"BODY ART."

14:27.200 --> 14:28.567
WHOA.

14:28.567 --> 14:29.567
WHAT?

14:29.567 --> 14:33.000
I'M SUCH A GOOD GEEK
I SCARED MYSELF.

14:33.000 --> 14:34.900
LISTEN, PINHEAD,

14:34.900 --> 14:36.367
IT'S MY BODY.

14:36.367 --> 14:38.734
AND I'LL DO WHATEVER
I WANT WITH IT,

14:38.734 --> 14:41.300
UNLESS MAYBE YOU'D LIKE
TO TRY AND STOP ME,

14:41.300 --> 14:43.300
YOU WOODCHUCK FACED,
NEARSIGHTED,

14:43.300 --> 14:46.767
UNDERWEIGHT,
FUTURE I.R.S. AUDITOR.

14:47.900 --> 14:49.834
MR. MINKUS,
I MIGHT REMIND YOU

14:49.834 --> 14:51.800
THAT EVENTUALLY
THE BELL WILL RING,

14:51.800 --> 14:53.900
AND HE WILL BE HE,
AND YOU WILL BE YOU,

14:53.900 --> 14:57.133
AND NATURAL SELECTION
WILL ONCE AGAIN RULE

14:57.133 --> 14:59.900
THE BLACKBOARD JUNGLE.

15:01.734 --> 15:03.400
WILL 5 COVER IT?

15:03.400 --> 15:06.834
HEY, TALK SOME MORE.

15:06.834 --> 15:08.900
OK, YOU LIVE
UNDER OUR ROOF.

15:08.900 --> 15:11.033
WE MAKE THE DECISIONS.
NO TATTOO.

15:11.033 --> 15:12.867
TATTOO, YOU, NO.

15:12.867 --> 15:15.600
A PERSON'S BODY
IS HIS TEMPLE.

15:15.600 --> 15:18.233
IF OUR SON WANTS TO
ORNAMENT HIS TEMPLE

15:18.233 --> 15:19.567
WITH A TATTOO,

15:19.567 --> 15:21.500
LET HIM WORSHIP
IN HIS OWN WAY.

15:21.500 --> 15:24.200
<i>NAM MYO </i>
<i>HO RENGE KYO. </i>

15:24.200 --> 15:27.800
YOU ARE SO BIZARRE!

15:27.800 --> 15:28.900
I'VE DECIDED,

15:28.900 --> 15:30.600
WITHOUT BENEFIT OF
DISCUSSION WITH MY SPOUSE--

15:30.600 --> 15:34.100
BECAUSE THAT'S THE KIND OF
HUSBAND I KNOW YOU'LL BE--

15:34.100 --> 15:37.500
THE TATTOO
WILL HAVE TO WAIT.

15:39.867 --> 15:41.367
WHOA.

15:41.367 --> 15:42.900
COOL.

15:42.900 --> 15:44.800
STUART,

15:44.800 --> 15:46.200
A TATTOO.

15:46.200 --> 15:48.233
IT SPEAKS TO ME.

15:50.500 --> 15:52.000
MINKUS, WHAT'S THE DEAL?

15:52.000 --> 15:53.834
WE AGREED ON NO TATTOO.

15:53.834 --> 15:55.033
MR. FEENY'S ASSIGNMENT

15:55.033 --> 15:56.867
WAS TO SOLVE
A FAMILY PROBLEM,

15:56.867 --> 15:59.367
AND I DECIDED
TO SOLVE IT MY WAY.

15:59.367 --> 16:01.667
WELL, ACTUALLY, HIS WAY.

16:01.667 --> 16:02.967
MINKUS...

16:02.967 --> 16:05.200
YOU'VE GOT
A DARK SIDE.

16:05.200 --> 16:07.200
IT SPEAKS TO ME.

16:07.200 --> 16:10.800
LET'S NOT GO OVERBOARD.
IT'S JUST A PRESS-ON.

16:10.800 --> 16:11.800
GREAT.

16:11.800 --> 16:14.000
THANKS FOR SCREWING UP
THE ASSIGNMENT.

16:14.000 --> 16:15.767
ON THE CONTRARY,
MR. MATTHEWS.

16:15.767 --> 16:18.834
MR. MINKUS DIDN'T SCREW UP
THE ASSIGNMENT AT ALL.

16:18.834 --> 16:20.967
YEAH, BUT WE HAD
OUR FAMILY DISCUSSION

16:20.967 --> 16:23.133
ALL PLANNED OUT,
AND HE MESSED IT UP.

16:23.133 --> 16:24.200
HE BROKE THE RULES.

16:24.200 --> 16:26.600
WHICH IS EXACTLY
WHAT HAPPENS

16:26.600 --> 16:28.600
IN REAL FAMILIES.

16:28.600 --> 16:31.734
THERE IS
NO MODEL HOUSEHOLD.

16:31.734 --> 16:33.800
THERE ARE
NO MODEL PARENTS.

16:33.800 --> 16:36.200
I THINK THE ONLY WAY
YOU CAN JUDGE A FAMILY

16:36.200 --> 16:38.233
IS BY HOW MUCH LOVE
THERE IS IN THE HOME.

16:38.233 --> 16:39.600
EXCELLENT POINT,
MISS LAWRENCE.

16:39.600 --> 16:42.300
A FAMILY IS A LIVING,
BREATHING THING

16:42.300 --> 16:46.033
THAT REQUIRES CONSTANT
ADJUSTMENT AND CHANGE.

16:46.033 --> 16:47.700
BUT BEAVER'S DAD
NEVER CHANGED.

16:47.700 --> 16:50.133
YOU ALWAYS KNEW WHAT
HE WAS GONNA SAY.

16:50.133 --> 16:51.967
BEAVER'S DAD
WASN'T REAL.

16:51.967 --> 16:53.867
REAL FATHERS
HAVE TO ADAPT.

16:53.867 --> 16:55.700
REAL FATHERS
DON'T HAVE A SCRIPT,

16:55.700 --> 16:57.500
LIKE BEAVER'S
FATHER DID.

16:57.500 --> 16:59.200
I GUESS IT'S EASY
TO SOUND SMART

16:59.200 --> 17:01.100
WHEN YOU'VE GOT THE BEST
WRITERS IN HOLLYWOOD

17:01.100 --> 17:04.467
WRITING EVERYTHING
YOU SAY.

17:04.467 --> 17:07.667
I WOULDN'T KNOW.

17:07.667 --> 17:08.767
HI. I'M ERIC MATTHEWS.

17:08.767 --> 17:10.867
I BELIEVE YOU'LL BE
TAKING PICTURES OF ME.

17:10.867 --> 17:13.033
[GIGGLES]
BECAUSE HE'S A MODEL.

17:13.033 --> 17:14.100
AND WE'RE
THE BABES

17:14.100 --> 17:15.700
WHO HANG OUT
WITH HIM.

17:15.700 --> 17:18.200
BECAUSE HE'S A MODEL.

17:18.200 --> 17:19.600
AND WHO ARE YOU?

17:19.600 --> 17:21.934
I'M THE HAPPY SIDEKICK.

17:23.100 --> 17:24.100
COME ON, MATTHEWS.

17:24.100 --> 17:25.400
THEY'RE WAITING FOR YOU
IN WARDROBE.

17:25.400 --> 17:27.934
WARDROBE--INDUSTRY TERM
FOR CLOTHES.

17:27.934 --> 17:29.467
EXCUSE ME.

17:29.467 --> 17:31.200
LOOK, MY SHOOT
STARTS AT 4:00.

17:31.200 --> 17:32.400
MAKE SURE
THESE GIRLS ARE HERE.

17:32.400 --> 17:35.900
I WANT THEM TO SEE ME
IN ALL MY GLORY.

17:35.900 --> 17:38.200
I QUIT!

17:38.200 --> 17:39.500
YOU CAN'T QUIT.

17:39.500 --> 17:40.600
YOU SIGNED A CONTRACT.

17:40.600 --> 17:42.200
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
WHAT IT'S LIKE

17:42.200 --> 17:44.200
TO DRESS UP IN
A HUMILIATING OUTFIT

17:44.200 --> 17:45.600
AND HAVE PEOPLE
GAWK AT YOU

17:45.600 --> 17:47.367
LIKE YOU'RE LESS
THAN HUMAN?

17:47.367 --> 17:49.967
BEEN THERE.
DONE THAT.

17:49.967 --> 17:54.400
WELCOME TO THE WORLD
OF BIG-TIME MODELING.

17:57.500 --> 17:59.500
WHAT ARE YOU
LOOKING AT?

18:01.600 --> 18:03.100
OH!

18:10.300 --> 18:12.300

OF IDIOT WOULD WEAR

18:12.300 --> 18:14.300
ONE OF THESE GETUPS
AT THE MALL?

18:14.300 --> 18:16.200
<i>Eric: </i>
<i>COME HERE! </i>

18:16.200 --> 18:17.400
APPARENTLY ERIC.

18:19.600 --> 18:22.100
ERIC, THIS MAY COME
AS SOMEWHAT OF A SHOCK,

18:22.100 --> 18:24.200
BUT YOU'RE
A LOBSTER, DUDE.

18:24.200 --> 18:25.900
LOOK, JASON AND I
INVITED 2 GIRLS HERE

18:25.900 --> 18:26.900
TO WATCH ME MODEL.

18:26.900 --> 18:30.033
WELL, I HOPE THEY BRING
A SIDE OF SLAW.

18:30.033 --> 18:31.200
[BOTH LAUGH]

18:31.200 --> 18:34.400

18:37.767 --> 18:39.300
YEAH, BUT HE HAD
TO LEAVE.

18:39.300 --> 18:40.600
WHY? WHAT HAPPENED?

18:40.600 --> 18:42.300
UH, HE'S NOT
FEELING WELL.

18:42.300 --> 18:44.400
YEAH, HE'S A LITTLE

18:46.600 --> 18:48.100
WOW, HOW WEIRD.

18:48.100 --> 18:49.667
HE WAS FINE
A FEW HOURS AGO.

18:49.667 --> 18:51.667
SO, I GUESS YOU WANT
TO JUST TAKE THE GIRLS

20:17.700 --> 20:18.934
WELL, THANKS, DAD.
YOU KNOW,

20:18.934 --> 20:20.667
IT TAKES TALENT
TO NOTICE TALENT.

20:20.667 --> 20:22.100
ARE YOU ASKING
FOR YOUR JOB BACK?

20:22.100 --> 20:24.200
UH, YES, BUT ASKING IS
JUST MY OPENING OFFER.

I'M PREPARED FOR BEGGING

MY JOB BACK, DAD.

20:41.400 --> 20:42.900
ERIC, I CAN'T
FIRE SOMEBODY

20:42.900 --> 20:44.934
JUST BECAUSE YOU SUDDENLY
WANT TO COME BACK.

20:44.934 --> 20:47.600
DAD, DO YOU REMEMBER
WHEN I WAS LITTLE,

20:47.600 --> 20:49.100
AND WE USED TO PLAY
MONOPOLY,

20:49.100 --> 20:50.900
AND I'D ROLL THE DICE
AND LAND ON BOARDWALK

20:50.900 --> 20:51.967
WHILE YOU HAD
A HOTEL ON IT?

20:51.967 --> 20:52.967

YEAH, BUT...

21:04.100 --> 21:05.367
YOU'RE NOT LITTLE

21:05.367 --> 21:07.367
YOU WANTED TO MAKE
YOUR OWN DECISIONS,

21:07.367 --> 21:09.667
LIVE YOUR OWN LIFE.
I LET YOU.

21:09.667 --> 21:11.400
I KNOW,
BUT COME ON, DAD.

21:11.400 --> 21:12.400
JUST FOR
OLD TIME'S SAKE?

21:12.400 --> 21:13.600
CAN'T I BE

21:13.600 --> 21:15.400
ERIC, I'M NOT ALWAYS
GONNA BE THERE

21:15.400 --> 21:16.667
TO GIVE YOU ANOTHER ROLL.

YOU'RE MY FATHER.

21:19.567 --> 21:21.700
YOU'RE SUPPOSED
TO HELP ME.

21:21.700 --> 21:25.033
CAN I HAVE
MY JOB BACK, PLEASE?

21:26.467 --> 21:27.667
NO.

21:27.667 --> 21:29.467
BUT WE COULD
USE SOME HELP

21:29.467 --> 21:31.300
ON THE WEEKEND
NIGHT SHIFT.

21:31.300 --> 21:33.400
MY OLD JOB?

21:33.400 --> 21:36.233
GOODBYE, FRIDAY
AND SATURDAY NIGHTS.

21:36.233 --> 21:37.300
WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE?

21:37.300 --> 21:39.467
AFTER THOSE 2 GIRLS
TELL ALL THE OTHER GIRLS

21:39.467 --> 21:41.834
ABOUT YOUR SECRET LIFE
AS A LOBSTER,

21:41.834 --> 21:44.500
DO YOU THINK
YOU'LL EVER DATE AGAIN?

21:44.500 --> 21:46.600
I'LL TAKE THE JOB.

21:46.600 --> 21:48.567
OOH, YOU'RE GOOD.

21:48.567 --> 21:50.000
OH, YOU THINK SO, HUH?

21:50.000 --> 21:52.600
YEAH, BECAUSE WHEN
YOU'RE A GOOD FATHER

21:52.600 --> 21:53.600
LIKE YOU AND ME,

21:53.600 --> 21:55.100
YOU REALIZE
THAT ONCE IN A WHILE

21:55.100 --> 21:58.500
KIDS DO STUPID THINGS
LIKE BECOME A LOBSTER

21:58.500 --> 21:59.600
OR GET A TATTOO.

21:59.600 --> 22:02.500
BUT A FAMILY'S A LIVING,
BREATHING THING.

22:02.500 --> 22:04.400
AND YOU DIDN'T
LET THAT THROW YOU.

22:04.400 --> 22:06.934
DID YOU GET
A TATTOO?

22:09.500 --> 22:10.834
HMM?
WHAT?

22:10.834 --> 22:12.100
DID YOU GET
A TATTOO?

22:12.100 --> 22:13.667
BECAUSE IF YOU GOT
A TATTOO,

22:13.667 --> 22:15.100
YOU ARE NOT
GONNA BE A LIVING,

22:15.100 --> 22:16.734
BREATHING THING.
WHERE IS IT?

22:16.734 --> 22:19.367
YOU'RE MISSING
THE POINT, DAD!

22:25.000 --> 22:27.600
[GRUNTING]

22:34.200 --> 22:36.667
SO YOU
TEACH MODELING, HUH?

22:36.667 --> 22:37.967
MM-HMM.

22:37.967 --> 22:39.700
AND YOU PROBABLY SELL
THE PICTURES

22:39.700 --> 22:42.000
A GUY WOULD NEED
FOR HIS PORTFOLIO, TOO?

22:42.000 --> 22:43.000
MM-HMM.

22:43.000 --> 22:45.400
AND THAT WOULD RUN
IN THE RANGE OF WHAT,

22:45.400 --> 22:46.967
90 BUCKS?

22:46.967 --> 22:48.200
ARE YOU LOST?

22:48.200 --> 22:51.400
NO. SEE, I SAW YOUR
MODELING PICTURES UP HERE,

22:51.400 --> 22:52.600
AND I WAS WONDERING

22:52.600 --> 22:54.467
IF I'M THE TYPE OF GUY
YOU'RE LOOKING FOR.

22:54.467 --> 22:55.934
NOT INTERESTED.

22:55.934 --> 22:57.100
HOW COME
YOU'RE NOT INTERESTED?

22:58.967 --> 23:00.867

23:00.867 --> 23:02.100
