00:02.504 --> 00:04.839
<i>Previously on Marvel's</i>
Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D...

00:07.050 --> 00:08.343
<i>Now you know
how it feels, Coulson.</i>

00:08.426 --> 00:10.345
<i>To watch someone you care for
bleed out right in front of you.</i>

00:10.428 --> 00:11.513
No, no.

00:11.596 --> 00:12.597
<i>Ward? What did you do?</i>

00:12.722 --> 00:13.765
Agent Mackenzie,

00:13.848 --> 00:15.183
to take Ward out,
I need to cross some lines

00:15.266 --> 00:16.601
the director of S.H.I.E.L.D.
shouldn't cross.

00:16.726 --> 00:17.936
Wait, you want me to fill in?

00:18.061 --> 00:19.521
As acting director, until it's finished.

00:19.604 --> 00:21.439
<i>Trace puts Ward
in the southwest of England.</i>

00:21.523 --> 00:23.108
They're at the castle
where we brought Simmons back.

00:23.233 --> 00:25.026
Which would explain
why he kidnapped her and Fitz.

00:25.110 --> 00:26.569
Because Malick's trying
to open another portal.

00:27.070 --> 00:28.113
It wants to come back.

00:28.196 --> 00:29.364
And, finally, after all these years,

00:29.447 --> 00:30.782
we found someone to help us do that.

00:31.116 --> 00:32.200
<i>Fitz, you can't do this.</i>

00:32.450 --> 00:34.285
We can't let them
bring that thing back to this planet.

00:34.369 --> 00:35.370
I lost you once.

00:35.453 --> 00:36.705
I can't lose you again.

00:36.788 --> 00:39.207
Only thing I'm gonna bring back
is Will, okay?

00:39.290 --> 00:41.543
Find it, get to the exit coordinates.

00:41.626 --> 00:44.462
We'll turn the portal back on
in exactly 12 hours.

00:44.587 --> 00:46.881
Be the one that finishes
what HYDRA started.

00:46.965 --> 00:48.383
<i>Looks like they're getting ready.</i>

00:48.466 --> 00:50.260
- That's Ward.
- He's going through.

00:51.469 --> 00:52.595
Coulson, wait!

00:54.639 --> 00:55.765
Shut it down.

01:26.129 --> 01:27.172
Something wrong?

01:32.844 --> 01:33.845
Fitz?

01:36.431 --> 01:38.266
- Go ahead and scout that ridge.
- Yes, sir.

01:43.980 --> 01:46.775
We have less than six hours to find
the next portal and go home.

01:46.858 --> 01:49.110
Why don't you shut the hell up
so I can concentrate?

01:49.861 --> 01:51.196
This programme's a work in progress,

01:51.321 --> 01:55.658
designed from Simmons' limited data
and hypothetical calculations.

01:56.451 --> 01:57.494
See?

01:58.036 --> 02:00.121
Our exit location is determined by
the position of the...

02:00.205 --> 02:01.498
Just figure it out.

02:11.883 --> 02:13.384
Aah!

02:13.843 --> 02:15.220
Let me be clear.

02:18.473 --> 02:20.892
If I don't make it back,
Simmons will be killed.

02:21.559 --> 02:24.062
Slowly. Horribly.

02:24.896 --> 02:26.147
And it'll all be your fault.

02:26.231 --> 02:27.315
Is that what you want?

02:27.398 --> 02:29.859
What do you want? Why are we here?

02:30.819 --> 02:34.072
To find some ancient,
mythical creature?

02:34.197 --> 02:35.990
Wake up, Ward.

02:36.074 --> 02:37.158
This is a snark hunt.

02:37.242 --> 02:40.411
And the only reason Malick sent you
is because you're expendable.

02:40.537 --> 02:42.413
Sir! Over here!

02:43.081 --> 02:44.249
Move.

02:44.415 --> 02:45.416
Move!

02:56.928 --> 02:58.596
Is that...

03:06.229 --> 03:07.605
Hail HYDRA.

03:36.175 --> 03:38.052
One of you wanna tell me
what Coulson was thinking

03:38.136 --> 03:39.637
jumping out of the Quinjet like that?

03:39.762 --> 03:41.723
I'd say he wasn't so much thinking
as feeling.

03:41.806 --> 03:43.266
Feeling that Ward needs to die.

03:43.349 --> 03:44.642
And you didn't try to stop him?

03:45.977 --> 03:48.313
Full disclosure,
I was planning on jumping as well.

03:49.355 --> 03:51.232
Again, less thinking than feeling.

03:51.316 --> 03:52.442
Coulson went there to get our people.

03:52.525 --> 03:54.277
Our people?
What are you talking about?

03:54.360 --> 03:57.280
We believe Ward took Fitz or Simmons
through the portal with him.

03:57.363 --> 03:59.407
Hopefully Coulson can find them
and bring them back safely.

03:59.490 --> 04:01.200
All we have to do is
take control of the castle

04:01.326 --> 04:02.785
and open the portal so they can return.

04:03.870 --> 04:06.831
So, just take
the ultra-fortified HYDRA castle

04:06.956 --> 04:08.207
and open the alien portal?

04:08.625 --> 04:09.667
That's it?

04:11.336 --> 04:13.171
You know you're wired different
than most folks.

04:13.296 --> 04:14.672
I'm not saying it'll be easy.

04:14.797 --> 04:16.132
I wouldn't mind hearing
it's gonna be easy.

04:16.214 --> 04:17.257
It'll be easy.

04:17.341 --> 04:19.052
It doesn't work if I know you're lying.

04:19.177 --> 04:21.471
<i>Mack... Or Director,
you guys should get up here.</i>

04:23.556 --> 04:25.975
This is HYDRA's compound
outside the castle.

04:26.059 --> 04:27.977
And these two trucks
were just unloaded.

04:28.061 --> 04:30.146
What are they
bringing in now? More weapons?

04:32.231 --> 04:34.943
Inhumans.
They're stockpiling Inhumans.

04:35.026 --> 04:38.529
That's how I read it. Looks like
10 or 12 of those gel-matrix containers.

04:39.405 --> 04:41.699
Andrew.
He's probably down there as well.

04:42.659 --> 04:45.370
Okay, so are we rescuing Inhumans,
or saving Coulson,

04:45.495 --> 04:47.872
or attacking HYDRA,
or is there some kind of combo?

04:50.541 --> 04:54.128
Sorry, new guy just trying to understand
how this whole S.H.I.E.L.D. thing works.

04:54.212 --> 04:55.505
This is how S.H.I.E.L.D. works.

04:55.588 --> 04:57.757
We make a plan, the plan
turns to rubbish, we make a new plan.

04:58.549 --> 04:59.676
Oh, just to be crystal clear,

04:59.759 --> 05:01.427
this is the part
where the plan turns to rubbish.

05:02.553 --> 05:05.348
Whatever the new plan, we need to
make sure those Inhumans are safe.

05:05.431 --> 05:06.766
And find Fitz and Simmons.

05:06.891 --> 05:08.309
And we get Coulson back
through the portal.

05:08.393 --> 05:10.061
Would everyone just shut up a second?

05:12.563 --> 05:15.233
Even cloaked, HYDRA's missiles
will find us if we get too close.

05:15.358 --> 05:17.652
And I will not be the one
who has to tell Coulson

05:17.735 --> 05:19.070
we got his fancy new plane blown up.

05:19.779 --> 05:24.075
Now, the only way to take the castle
and secure the portal is on the QT.

05:24.200 --> 05:26.077
That means no gunfire.

05:26.202 --> 05:27.537
And no backup.

05:29.205 --> 05:31.249
We leave all tactical support up here,
is that clear?

05:32.625 --> 05:36.337
Two infiltration teams. One to search
the compound for Fitz or Simmons,

05:36.421 --> 05:38.131
and one to secure the portal.

05:38.256 --> 05:39.507
We'll take care of everyone.

05:39.590 --> 05:40.842
Including the Inhumans.

05:40.925 --> 05:41.968
But first things first.

05:42.093 --> 05:43.094
Go.

05:44.762 --> 05:48.141
Satellite's at your disposal.
Find us a back door, Tremors.

05:56.399 --> 05:57.775
The cargo's here.

05:57.900 --> 06:00.361
All Inhuman systems
are stable and online.

06:00.445 --> 06:02.238
The team is ready to revive them.

06:02.321 --> 06:04.574
Patience, Mr Giyera.

06:04.949 --> 06:06.617
They're not our toys to play with.

06:06.743 --> 06:10.371
They're presents for our friend
once Grant Ward brings it back.

06:10.455 --> 06:12.457
Every general needs an army.

06:13.624 --> 06:16.502
So, how long do we have
once the portal re-opens?

06:16.627 --> 06:18.337
- Seventy-three seconds.
- He's wrong.

06:19.172 --> 06:21.966
Your team's calculations are off. It's 61.

06:22.091 --> 06:23.426
Twelve seconds
might not seem like much,

06:23.509 --> 06:25.887
but on that planet, it can be
the difference between life and death.

06:25.970 --> 06:27.013
Thank you.

06:27.138 --> 06:28.806
I'm not doing it for you.

06:28.931 --> 06:30.975
I don't want you all
mucking up Fitz's return.

06:33.478 --> 06:38.608
Did you notice the Hebrew word
<i>maveth</i> carved around the castle?

06:38.691 --> 06:40.443
- Death.
- That's right.

06:40.526 --> 06:43.488
Well, death is the only thing
returning through that portal.

06:43.613 --> 06:45.198
Fitz was just

06:45.323 --> 06:47.533
an offering to show him the door.

06:53.998 --> 06:57.210
The original machinery used
to open the portal was hydroelectric.

06:57.335 --> 06:59.504
But the nearest river
is almost a half a mile away,

06:59.629 --> 07:01.839
which got me wondering
how they powered it.

07:02.715 --> 07:04.383
- Aqueducts.
- Yeah.

07:04.509 --> 07:06.219
So, they brought the water along there

07:06.344 --> 07:08.221
and then
up through the portal chamber.

07:08.346 --> 07:11.516
Now, that looks like an overflow drain,
deep in the woods.

07:11.641 --> 07:13.184
So, we should be able to
slip into the compound

07:13.309 --> 07:14.685
without anyone seeing a thing.

07:14.811 --> 07:17.355
I'll exit here with Bobbi and Hunter.

07:17.480 --> 07:20.316
Hopefully we can barricade ourselves
long enough to open the portal

07:20.399 --> 07:21.734
and get Coulson back.

07:21.859 --> 07:24.153
May, you and Daisy
take Lincoln and Joey

07:24.237 --> 07:26.405
and you come out here,
on the southeast side.

07:27.156 --> 07:28.533
Let's find our people

07:29.534 --> 07:31.035
and get out.

07:35.373 --> 07:36.791
Hey.

07:36.874 --> 07:38.626
Here's a great idea.

07:38.709 --> 07:41.879
Why don't we go to an alien world
and summon a hell beast?

07:42.004 --> 07:43.506
Yeah, that's a brilliant idea.

07:43.589 --> 07:45.716
What could possibly
go wrong with that?

07:47.009 --> 07:48.636
How are you supposed to find it?

07:48.719 --> 07:50.054
Not your concern.

07:50.179 --> 07:52.515
You just whisper its name
three times into a mirror?

07:52.598 --> 07:55.560
Or do you put a saucer of milk
outside the door at night?

07:55.685 --> 07:57.520
Not milk.

07:57.603 --> 08:00.398
Ah, yes, you're right.
Simmons said it can smell blood.

08:00.523 --> 08:02.358
That's not disturbing at all.

08:03.359 --> 08:05.403
Who wouldn't want to be on that team?

08:06.946 --> 08:08.030
Uh...

08:10.241 --> 08:12.869
I think that's the ridge
we're looking for.

08:18.416 --> 08:20.751
You know, uh, Simmons also said
it can drive people crazy.

08:20.877 --> 08:23.421
You're doing a pretty good job
of that yourself.

08:27.592 --> 08:28.676
What's that?

08:28.759 --> 08:30.761
That's an interesting question.

08:30.845 --> 08:31.888
I thought I might check.

08:32.388 --> 08:33.431
Get away from there.

08:37.268 --> 08:38.269
Hello?

08:38.436 --> 08:40.188
Circle around and make sure
there's no exit.

08:40.270 --> 08:41.355
Will?

08:43.274 --> 08:44.275
Hey.

08:44.942 --> 08:45.943
Hey, Will.

08:47.945 --> 08:49.030
Hey.

08:50.281 --> 08:51.866
- You're Fitz.
- Yeah.

08:57.538 --> 08:59.040
- I warned you.
- Wait. Wait.

09:00.249 --> 09:02.210
- Who the hell is this?
- This is Will. Okay?

09:02.919 --> 09:04.128
He's gonna be our guide.

09:13.888 --> 09:14.931
Good morning.

09:24.899 --> 09:26.484
I thought I'd lost you.

09:26.567 --> 09:28.778
Nope. I'm still right here.

09:31.489 --> 09:33.491
- I don't remember...
- We overslept.

09:34.617 --> 09:35.993
Which is nice.

09:37.078 --> 09:38.913
But now you need to get up.

09:45.169 --> 09:47.463
How about we stay here
for a while instead?

09:48.631 --> 09:50.341
Mmm. Nothing would make me happier.

09:51.509 --> 09:52.843
But it's time.

09:54.637 --> 09:56.430
They need you, Phil.

09:56.514 --> 09:57.640
More than ever.

09:58.349 --> 09:59.767
Just one more minute.

10:00.351 --> 10:01.852
No.

10:01.978 --> 10:03.145
Now.

10:04.355 --> 10:05.523
Get up!

10:24.041 --> 10:25.876
I'll be damned.

10:25.960 --> 10:27.128
Tatooine.

11:00.911 --> 11:02.246
<i>You can't do this!</i>

11:02.330 --> 11:04.999
Ward, listen to me! You can't kill him!

11:05.082 --> 11:07.084
It's your fault, Fitz!
You didn't follow my instructions!

11:07.168 --> 11:10.755
But I did! I did! That's why we're here.
We're all dead without him!

11:10.880 --> 11:13.758
You told me to identify the exit point,
which I can do.

11:13.883 --> 11:16.260
But only that man there,
the one you want to kill,

11:16.385 --> 11:17.595
can get us there in time!

11:29.940 --> 11:31.275
So, how long have you been here?

11:34.904 --> 11:36.697
Feels like forever.

11:39.700 --> 11:42.370
So you're how Simmons managed to
survive all those cold nights. Huh?

11:43.079 --> 11:44.288
Hmm.

11:44.914 --> 11:46.707
Maybe you want to pull the trigger.

11:46.791 --> 11:48.292
Grow up, Ward.

11:52.922 --> 11:54.048
Can you walk on that leg?

12:01.305 --> 12:02.473
What happened?

12:02.973 --> 12:04.225
I got attacked.

12:04.308 --> 12:05.893
After Jemma left.

12:05.976 --> 12:07.812
You saved her.

12:07.937 --> 12:09.647
She made it out and now
I'm here to take you back.

12:10.898 --> 12:12.400
I can leave?

12:12.483 --> 12:14.151
- Really?
- Yeah.

12:14.235 --> 12:15.611
Yeah. We're all going to leave.

12:17.571 --> 12:19.281
You said you were attacked.

12:19.407 --> 12:20.741
By what?

12:21.492 --> 12:22.576
It.

12:24.453 --> 12:26.414
So you know how to find it?

12:27.289 --> 12:28.666
Why would you want to do that?

12:28.749 --> 12:30.751
I've brought it a gift.

12:32.086 --> 12:33.129
We should go.

12:45.516 --> 12:47.143
Nicely done, rookie.

12:53.315 --> 12:55.025
Bobbi and Hunter are with me.

12:55.109 --> 12:58.154
May, you take the Power Rangers
and go find Fitz or Simmons.

13:18.883 --> 13:19.884
Check it.

13:42.740 --> 13:45.075
Okay, we definitely want to
avoid the guy with the suit.

13:45.159 --> 13:46.160
He's telekinetic.

13:46.243 --> 13:47.828
Is that the one
where he can read your mind

13:47.912 --> 13:49.079
or move stuff with his mind?

13:49.163 --> 13:50.164
Move stuff.

13:50.247 --> 13:53.167
Good. I don't want anyone knowing
what I'm thinking right now.

13:53.250 --> 13:55.169
You mean that you're not a hero?

13:55.252 --> 13:58.422
That you're freaking out and want to be
anywhere but here?

13:59.423 --> 14:00.591
We're all feeling that.

14:01.050 --> 14:02.510
I'm not.

14:02.593 --> 14:04.929
Okay, all of us but May.

14:05.012 --> 14:06.096
You're doing great. Okay?

14:06.222 --> 14:08.849
Just breathe, stick close,
and follow our lead.

14:08.933 --> 14:11.936
Be a hell of a lot easier
if it wasn't lit up like a county fair.

14:12.937 --> 14:14.063
On it.

14:20.611 --> 14:21.612
Check the generator.

14:27.868 --> 14:28.911
Yeah, I copy that.

14:29.745 --> 14:31.539
Can you just give us an update
of what's going on out there

14:31.622 --> 14:32.623
with the generators?

14:32.748 --> 14:35.084
<i>Right. Pull them back up.</i>

14:48.973 --> 14:50.057
Can you run?

14:51.308 --> 14:52.768
I don't know. Why?

14:53.602 --> 14:55.312
Ward works for the same group
that sent you here.

14:55.396 --> 14:57.231
They've been sending people over
for centuries.

14:57.314 --> 14:58.774
Sacrifices.

14:59.650 --> 15:02.945
Their real agenda is to find the creature
and bring it back.

15:04.280 --> 15:05.739
Ward found a way to bring it back?

15:05.823 --> 15:07.408
No, I did.

15:07.491 --> 15:08.784
To get Simmons back.

15:09.243 --> 15:12.079
Ward's just a HYDRA toady
who hijacked it.

15:12.162 --> 15:13.747
HYDRA.

15:13.831 --> 15:15.416
- That's an old name.
- Yeah.

15:15.499 --> 15:18.252
They're still at it.
Cut off one head and...

15:18.836 --> 15:20.170
Blah, blah, blah.

15:21.839 --> 15:24.300
I didn't know I was doing something
they've been working on for ages.

15:27.177 --> 15:28.596
You're bleeding.

15:31.098 --> 15:32.516
Yeah, so are you.

15:35.311 --> 15:38.355
You know,
I'd run a dozen scenarios in my head,

15:38.439 --> 15:41.317
wondering what it'd be like
when we finally met.

15:43.277 --> 15:45.154
There's a lot more blood.

15:45.779 --> 15:47.531
And I never considered the smell.

15:51.827 --> 15:53.704
I can see why Jemma loves you.

15:56.373 --> 15:58.667
The good news is Ward needs us alive.

15:59.627 --> 16:03.047
I'm the only one that can read the data
and get us to the extraction point.

16:03.172 --> 16:05.883
We just have to try and find a way
to lose them before we get to the exit.

16:08.052 --> 16:09.386
Follow my lead.

16:11.680 --> 16:13.057
What's the holdup?

16:13.891 --> 16:16.060
There's no holdup. We just
need to make it through that canyon.

16:18.729 --> 16:20.022
You're sure?

16:20.481 --> 16:22.858
That's the only way to make it in time.

16:25.903 --> 16:27.237
All right. Lead on.

17:00.437 --> 17:01.689
Inhumans.

17:07.861 --> 17:10.239
The prisoner's escaped.
Seal the perimeter.

17:18.288 --> 17:20.249
This is our containment module.

17:25.045 --> 17:26.088
Jemma.

17:27.964 --> 17:29.341
Help me. Please.

17:29.925 --> 17:31.218
Let me out.

17:35.848 --> 17:37.725
- Did Coulson send you?
- No. I...

17:37.808 --> 17:39.476
I'm a prisoner. HYDRA's looking for me.

17:40.144 --> 17:41.395
Where are we?

17:42.271 --> 17:45.149
England. HYDRA's got Fitz.
They've re-opened the portal.

17:46.191 --> 17:47.943
Let me out. I can help.

17:48.026 --> 17:50.154
I've seen your help.
Autopsied the bodies.

17:51.447 --> 17:52.990
Is that why
you handed me over to HYDRA?

17:53.073 --> 17:54.825
We didn't know
they controlled the ATCU.

17:54.908 --> 17:56.535
May and Coulson
were trying to save you.

17:56.618 --> 17:58.036
Save...

17:58.120 --> 17:59.747
Maybe you didn't hear,
but Melinda shot me.

17:59.830 --> 18:02.374
Well, I can't say I blame her
after how you've misbehaved.

18:04.752 --> 18:05.794
Jemma.

18:06.795 --> 18:10.591
We may disagree about the Inhumans,
but we both hate HYDRA.

18:10.674 --> 18:12.843
Open this door and I'll protect you.

18:15.554 --> 18:17.890
I would never, ever hurt you.

18:18.390 --> 18:20.642
But HYDRA will kill you.

18:20.726 --> 18:23.187
Maybe you wouldn't,
but what about that thing you...

18:24.563 --> 18:25.939
You gotta let me out, Jemma.

18:26.774 --> 18:28.817
I'm the only one who can protect you.

18:31.320 --> 18:32.446
Circle behind.

18:34.072 --> 18:35.949
Get your hands up. Back up.

18:36.950 --> 18:38.702
It's okay. It's all right.
Just don't shoot.

18:38.827 --> 18:41.205
Just don't shoot.

19:11.693 --> 19:13.153
Hang in there, Fitz.

19:21.537 --> 19:23.330
I saw something today.

19:23.872 --> 19:26.917
Looked like a giant statue. Ancient.

19:27.376 --> 19:28.627
Looked like a shrine.

19:28.710 --> 19:30.003
It used to live there.

19:30.087 --> 19:31.797
Yeah, but who built it?

19:31.880 --> 19:33.632
Were there people here?

19:33.715 --> 19:35.217
A civilisation?

19:35.300 --> 19:37.427
All I've ever seen here is death.

19:39.638 --> 19:42.140
Pretty impressive you've survived
all these years.

19:42.724 --> 19:44.142
It couldn't have been easy.

19:44.935 --> 19:46.603
I learned to adapt.

19:47.437 --> 19:49.022
Change or die.

19:49.815 --> 19:51.358
That's worked for me as well.

19:52.025 --> 19:54.194
Earth's going through a big change
right now.

19:54.278 --> 19:56.238
Some kind of alien contagion.

19:56.864 --> 19:59.074
Call themselves Inhumans.

19:59.157 --> 20:02.578
I'm not thrilled about it,
but the wind's blowing that way, so...

20:03.704 --> 20:05.831
It's gonna be a bad one.

20:13.171 --> 20:14.840
I'm used to it.

20:16.341 --> 20:19.428
Simmons told me about an area
called the "No Fly Zone."

20:19.511 --> 20:20.679
You're leading us there, aren't you?

20:20.762 --> 20:22.931
We're already in it. Stay close.

20:29.813 --> 20:30.856
We're in.

20:32.399 --> 20:34.526
- Where are we?
- Pretty sure that's us.

20:37.571 --> 20:38.739
Brilliant.

20:38.822 --> 20:40.657
Just confirming it's really us.

20:41.491 --> 20:42.701
It is.

20:42.784 --> 20:43.869
You're welcome.

20:44.661 --> 20:46.622
If we're here, and we want to go there,

20:46.705 --> 20:49.291
we need to get past about
a dozen HYDRA soldiers.

20:49.374 --> 20:50.626
And we need to do it
as covertly as possible.

20:50.709 --> 20:51.752
Copy that.

20:54.963 --> 20:56.924
Are we supposed to wait here or help?

21:03.513 --> 21:05.766
We need to stay
hunkered down, sir.

21:05.849 --> 21:07.351
We don't have time for this.

21:28.997 --> 21:30.082
Hey!

21:31.458 --> 21:34.086
I think we took a wrong turn. This is...

21:40.050 --> 21:41.593
You said they were going to kill us.

21:41.677 --> 21:42.803
Did you have a better idea?

21:51.478 --> 21:52.729
What are they doing?

21:53.188 --> 21:54.606
It's not them, it's me.

22:00.237 --> 22:02.197
Okay, let's see what we've got.

22:14.292 --> 22:15.544
Daisy! Watch out!

22:28.223 --> 22:29.266
Lincoln, don't!

22:29.349 --> 22:31.059
There's no way they didn't hear that.
Come on.

22:31.143 --> 22:32.185
We gotta go.

22:32.728 --> 22:33.770
Did you see that?

22:35.647 --> 22:37.065
I'm bulletproof.

22:38.650 --> 22:40.235
Investigating gunfire now.

22:41.319 --> 22:42.654
Stop!

22:48.827 --> 22:50.328
Agent May!

22:50.412 --> 22:51.455
Fitz?

22:51.538 --> 22:52.581
Ward took him through the portal.

22:52.664 --> 22:53.915
Come on, we're gonna get him back.

22:53.999 --> 22:55.042
Andrew's here!

22:55.542 --> 22:57.586
- You saw him?
- He saved my life.

22:57.669 --> 22:59.004
Andrew or Lash?

22:59.087 --> 23:00.380
Technically, I think it was both.

23:00.464 --> 23:02.257
- We can find him. Maybe...
- No.

23:02.340 --> 23:03.717
That's not the mission.

23:03.800 --> 23:07.054
Daisy, I've got Simmons,
heading your way now.

23:10.932 --> 23:12.184
We've gotta go.

23:19.733 --> 23:20.776
Fan out. Find them.

23:26.323 --> 23:27.365
No.

23:32.079 --> 23:33.580
You'll never find Fitz without me.

23:33.663 --> 23:34.873
I'm not here for Fitz.

23:34.956 --> 23:36.166
Maybe.

23:36.750 --> 23:38.543
But you're not going to
let him die here, either.

23:38.627 --> 23:41.546
Fitz is a smart guy.
He'll find his way back.

23:41.630 --> 23:43.298
He'll be dead within the hour.

23:44.299 --> 23:46.384
The creature
who lives here can smell blood.

23:47.219 --> 23:48.470
Fitz is bleeding.

23:51.848 --> 23:52.891
So are you.

23:53.850 --> 23:55.143
Now get up.

23:55.227 --> 23:56.645
You're gonna lead the way.

24:04.569 --> 24:05.862
Party's this way.

24:10.992 --> 24:12.160
Watch your step.

24:12.244 --> 24:14.913
I left a few breadcrumbs
to find our way home.

24:22.254 --> 24:23.338
Simmons.

24:24.172 --> 24:25.715
HYDRA knows we grabbed her.

24:25.799 --> 24:28.176
- How secure are we in here?
- Rough estimate? Not very.

24:28.260 --> 24:29.803
We've sealed and barricaded the doors,

24:29.886 --> 24:32.222
but HYDRA has plenty of
big boy toys to smash their way in.

24:32.305 --> 24:33.849
I might be able to reinforce the doors.

24:34.474 --> 24:35.851
You know, using my, uh...

24:37.227 --> 24:38.395
Amazing new super power.

24:38.478 --> 24:40.355
- Yeah, that.
- Let's give that a go, then.

24:41.690 --> 24:42.816
Mack's through there.

24:50.157 --> 24:51.408
There she is.

24:51.491 --> 24:53.034
That's what I'm talking about.

24:54.161 --> 24:56.913
Now, do you have any idea
how the hell these rocks work?

24:56.997 --> 24:58.874
Is that counting down to
a good thing or a bad thing?

24:58.957 --> 25:01.334
It's the time remaining
until the portal re-opens.

25:01.418 --> 25:02.460
And answering your question,

25:02.544 --> 25:04.462
I don't believe we have to do anything
to these rocks.

25:04.546 --> 25:07.048
They're configured so
they'll activate at the designated time.

25:07.132 --> 25:08.508
So that's a good thing.

25:08.592 --> 25:11.344
That depends on whether
Fitz can locate the extraction point

25:11.428 --> 25:13.013
and who or what is with him.

25:13.096 --> 25:14.514
He'll make it. Coulson's there.

25:14.598 --> 25:16.391
I know, but it's more complicated
than that.

25:16.474 --> 25:18.101
- Ward's mission is to...
- Where's May?

25:19.311 --> 25:20.604
Oh, no.

25:22.105 --> 25:24.149
Dr Garner is here on the premises.

25:24.232 --> 25:26.693
I spoke with him.
He's actually the one who saved me.

25:26.776 --> 25:27.944
He's free?

25:30.238 --> 25:31.740
May must have gone back for him.

25:31.823 --> 25:32.866
To do what?

25:33.867 --> 25:36.620
I'd say that depends on what she finds.

25:56.681 --> 25:58.183
Oh, God...

26:00.227 --> 26:01.811
<i>I saw something
terrible today...</i>

26:01.895 --> 26:04.439
When I say terrible, I mean ancient,

26:04.522 --> 26:06.066
and powerful.

26:06.691 --> 26:08.610
It changed how I see things.

26:10.320 --> 26:12.447
I've never believed

26:12.530 --> 26:14.699
I was worth anything,

26:15.200 --> 26:17.619
and what I said or did had any meaning.

26:17.702 --> 26:19.412
Maybe that's why I'm a spy.

26:20.789 --> 26:23.333
Or why I agreed to come here.

26:23.416 --> 26:25.794
If you're trying to talk me out of this,
you can save your breath.

26:26.294 --> 26:28.964
I'm not looking for mercy or absolution.

26:29.547 --> 26:32.342
I just want you to know,
I've been where you are right now.

26:33.009 --> 26:34.636
Filled with rage.

26:34.719 --> 26:36.638
Wanting revenge.

26:37.305 --> 26:40.058
I chose HYDRA

26:40.141 --> 26:43.061
for petty, personal, selfish reasons.

26:43.979 --> 26:45.397
For a father figure,

26:46.314 --> 26:47.607
for vengeance,

26:48.233 --> 26:49.818
for closure.

26:52.070 --> 26:53.780
But what I saw today

26:54.406 --> 26:56.032
gave my life meaning.

26:56.866 --> 27:00.203
For the first time ever,
I have a sense of satisfaction

27:00.287 --> 27:04.874
that I never experienced
when I was seeking revenge.

27:08.503 --> 27:10.130
Gotta say,

27:10.213 --> 27:12.424
it feels pretty satisfying to me.

27:12.507 --> 27:14.050
Now turn around and keep walking.

27:15.010 --> 27:17.053
You know,
everyone had this place wrong.

27:17.804 --> 27:19.055
It isn't death.

27:20.098 --> 27:21.725
It's a new beginning.

27:22.642 --> 27:24.311
Malick was right.

27:25.437 --> 27:26.855
This is all meant to be.

27:28.398 --> 27:30.191
And the fact that you followed me here,

27:30.692 --> 27:32.736
that we're in this together,

27:32.819 --> 27:34.863
that just confirms the fact that

27:35.655 --> 27:37.741
I'm part of a grand plan.

27:38.616 --> 27:40.243
I see that now.

27:40.327 --> 27:42.871
I honestly have no idea
what you're talking about.

27:43.913 --> 27:45.457
You will.

27:51.129 --> 27:54.257
Malick sent Ward to bring back
some ancient HYDRA god?

27:54.341 --> 27:57.344
He didn't use those exact words,
but that's the general idea, yes.

27:57.427 --> 27:59.387
It's why he had
the ATCU collecting Inhumans.

27:59.471 --> 28:01.264
Why he shipped them here
to the castle.

28:01.348 --> 28:03.725
As some kind of army
for this powerful alien.

28:03.808 --> 28:06.519
Look, we all want
Fitz and Coulson back,

28:06.603 --> 28:09.272
but what if that thing comes back, too?

28:09.356 --> 28:11.566
Your mother was terrified
of the Monolith for a reason.

28:11.649 --> 28:13.443
You think the HYDRA thing
is what she was afraid of?

28:13.526 --> 28:14.986
When S.H.I.E.L.D. fell,

28:15.070 --> 28:16.196
Fury sent us onto the <i>Iliad</i>

28:16.279 --> 28:18.239
to keep HYDRA from getting
their hands on that Monolith.

28:18.823 --> 28:22.243
What if he knew that they wanted
to bring this creature back through it?

28:22.327 --> 28:24.704
Oh, come on.

28:24.788 --> 28:26.039
What, an ancient alien god?

28:26.122 --> 28:28.625
Are you people hearing the words
coming out of your mouths?

28:28.708 --> 28:30.919
The world's changing. Deal with it.

28:31.002 --> 28:32.504
You were there.

28:32.587 --> 28:34.547
Did you see it? What's it like?

28:35.382 --> 28:37.675
I did see it.

28:37.759 --> 28:39.344
But I can't really describe
what it looked like.

28:39.427 --> 28:42.263
It's more how it felt,
which is old and pained.

28:42.347 --> 28:44.432
As if it once had great power,
but lost it.

28:44.516 --> 28:46.559
And the entire planet is a wasteland.

28:47.227 --> 28:50.605
How that came to be, I can't really say,
not in any scientific terms.

28:51.398 --> 28:53.900
But my sense and certainly

28:53.983 --> 28:58.113
Will's heartfelt belief was
that the creature is the one responsible.

28:58.863 --> 29:01.199
That it caused the desolation.

29:04.744 --> 29:05.954
We have to destroy all this.

29:06.037 --> 29:08.665
You mean, once Fitz and Coulson
find Will and come back through.

29:08.748 --> 29:12.085
I mean, what if they're not the ones
who come back through?

29:12.585 --> 29:13.670
We can't risk that.

29:13.753 --> 29:15.880
Whatever we decide to do
isn't the end of the mission.

29:15.964 --> 29:17.841
There are a dozen
Inhumans in this compound

29:17.924 --> 29:19.467
that we can't leave behind.

29:19.551 --> 29:21.010
Yes, you can.

29:22.011 --> 29:23.179
They're dead.

29:23.972 --> 29:28.143
Lash or Andrew, honestly, I'm not sure
there's a difference any more.

29:29.102 --> 29:30.270
He killed them all.

29:44.617 --> 29:45.952
Sir,

29:46.035 --> 29:48.037
S.H.I.E.L.D. has infiltrated the castle.

29:48.121 --> 29:50.874
Barricaded themselves
inside the portal chamber.

29:50.957 --> 29:52.250
We need to get you off the premises.

29:52.333 --> 29:54.335
You have less than 15 minutes

29:54.419 --> 29:56.671
to breach their barricades
and regain control of that chamber.

29:57.130 --> 29:59.174
- Sir...
- That's an order, soldier.

30:18.651 --> 30:19.694
Hold up.

30:39.005 --> 30:40.798
How long before that portal opens?

30:40.882 --> 30:42.842
There's a timer on my watch.

30:57.482 --> 30:59.275
Come on, we need to move faster.

30:59.734 --> 31:02.195
I could move faster
if you hadn't shot me.

31:02.278 --> 31:03.363
Twice.

31:06.783 --> 31:07.867
What's that?

31:07.951 --> 31:09.577
I'm gonna go out on a limb
and guess HYDRA.

31:10.578 --> 31:11.913
We reinforced the barricades,

31:11.996 --> 31:13.206
but it won't take them long
to break through.

31:17.043 --> 31:18.169
No way they're taking this again.

31:18.253 --> 31:19.921
We can't destroy it before
Fitz and Coulson return.

31:20.004 --> 31:21.047
Not when we're this close.

31:21.506 --> 31:22.924
What if the creature
comes through instead?

31:23.007 --> 31:24.676
We'll be waiting for them with these.

31:24.759 --> 31:25.927
And what if we can't kill it?

31:26.010 --> 31:27.971
I can't speak for everyone,
but I'll probably run.

31:28.721 --> 31:31.307
Get everyone out through the tunnel
and back up to Zephyr One.

31:31.391 --> 31:33.184
I'm gonna stay here
until the last possible second

31:33.268 --> 31:34.561
for Coulson, Fitz and Will.

31:34.644 --> 31:37.313
Now, if HYDRA or that alien thing
gets inside here,

31:37.397 --> 31:40.316
you light this castle and compound up
with every missile on that plane.

31:40.400 --> 31:41.776
What?
No, I'm not leaving you here.

31:41.859 --> 31:44.320
Or Bobbi and I can cover
a couple of the barricaded entrances.

31:44.404 --> 31:45.863
Buy us enough time
for the portal to open.

31:45.989 --> 31:47.073
Yeah, I'm down with that plan.

31:47.156 --> 31:48.700
If HYDRA tries to get
through the barricades, I can...

31:48.825 --> 31:49.826
Hey!

31:49.909 --> 31:52.829
What part of, "That's an order,"
do you not understand?

31:53.997 --> 31:56.165
Coulson put me in charge
to make the hard call,

31:56.249 --> 31:57.292
and that's what I'm doing.

31:57.375 --> 32:00.003
We can't afford to lose
our best agents in one fell swoop.

32:00.086 --> 32:01.754
Not here. Not tonight!

32:05.216 --> 32:07.010
If I don't get out,

32:08.928 --> 32:10.263
May's the new director.

32:10.346 --> 32:12.223
That's what Coulson would want.

32:12.348 --> 32:13.600
Okay.

32:13.683 --> 32:15.184
But one thing.

32:15.268 --> 32:16.477
I'm staying with you

32:16.561 --> 32:19.147
because, A, I can keep the portal open
if something goes wrong.

32:19.230 --> 32:21.399
And, B, I'm your partner.

32:22.859 --> 32:24.360
Technically, that's two things.

32:26.404 --> 32:28.573
Daisy stays.
Everyone else, get the hell out of here!

32:40.877 --> 32:42.629
Is your leg going to be okay?

32:42.712 --> 32:44.088
I don't really feel it.

32:44.213 --> 32:46.049
The portal's just over this rise.

32:46.716 --> 32:49.636
It's going to be close,
but I think we're gonna make it.

32:50.470 --> 32:52.555
Jemma's gonna be really happy
to see you.

32:53.431 --> 32:55.475
This must be very difficult for you.

32:56.100 --> 32:59.771
Getting you off this godforsaken
planet is all that matters.

33:06.903 --> 33:09.614
Jemma never told me
there was an ancient civilisation here.

33:09.739 --> 33:12.617
She never saw it.
We're still in the No Fly Zone.

33:24.587 --> 33:26.798
What else do you know
about the ancient city?

33:26.923 --> 33:30.635
What happened to it? Whoa, whoa.
Hey! Hey! Hang on. Hang on.

33:31.427 --> 33:32.512
Let me fix that.

33:32.595 --> 33:35.348
There used to be
nine cities on this planet.

33:35.431 --> 33:36.974
The beings who lived there
were fairly advanced.

33:37.975 --> 33:40.812
But they feared change.
They were easily divided.

33:40.937 --> 33:43.981
They warred among themselves,
destroyed their entire race.

33:47.151 --> 33:48.986
You seem to know a lot about them.

33:49.112 --> 33:50.571
They had a chance

33:50.655 --> 33:53.199
to become something great,
something beautiful,

33:54.117 --> 33:55.201
but in the end...

33:57.286 --> 33:58.496
How do you know so much about...

34:02.041 --> 34:03.876
Because I was there.

34:07.839 --> 34:09.674
- You're not Will.
- No.

34:09.799 --> 34:11.551
Will died saving Jemma.

34:12.969 --> 34:14.512
From me.

35:04.729 --> 35:05.772
Listen up.

35:05.855 --> 35:08.357
All weapon systems online,
and then take her up to 20,000 feet.

35:08.441 --> 35:09.484
Yes, ma'am.

35:09.567 --> 35:10.610
Bobbi?

35:11.944 --> 35:13.237
Looks like HYDRA's inside the castle.

35:15.698 --> 35:17.366
They're gonna make it. Right?

35:20.953 --> 35:21.996
Tell me that was you.

35:22.079 --> 35:23.956
That's just them getting closer.

35:25.082 --> 35:27.627
Okay, Tremors. Let's hope this works.

35:58.658 --> 35:59.867
I forgot about this part.

35:59.951 --> 36:01.577
Get out of here, I can handle everything.

36:01.661 --> 36:03.246
I'm not leaving. I'll be fine.

36:05.790 --> 36:07.166
Did you see that?

36:10.837 --> 36:12.797
One minute left.
We don't have much time.

36:12.922 --> 36:14.924
You may have to hold this thing open.

36:17.093 --> 36:19.178
In case you-know-what shows up
instead of our peeps.

36:20.012 --> 36:21.722
Anything other than our people
comes out,

36:21.806 --> 36:23.599
we give May the high sign
and blow it to hell.

36:23.683 --> 36:25.643
Same if HYDRA gets in here.

36:55.464 --> 36:56.883
It's open. There's the portal.

36:56.966 --> 36:58.009
That's good.

36:58.134 --> 37:00.344
But that's not. HYDRA's almost in.

37:01.220 --> 37:05.516
All weapons systems go hot,
stand by for my command.

37:18.821 --> 37:20.364
How many people?

37:21.908 --> 37:23.159
The lives you've taken.

37:27.997 --> 37:29.373
It's over, Ward.

37:57.193 --> 37:58.527
We're out of time.

38:05.701 --> 38:08.287
Coulson! The portal's closing!

38:10.873 --> 38:13.542
He's finished, leave him. Let's go.

38:14.543 --> 38:15.586
Now!

38:16.045 --> 38:17.964
Now! We have to go.

39:30.119 --> 39:31.787
<i>Do it, May. Now!</i>

39:55.978 --> 39:57.980
<i>Open the doors, I'm bringing them in.</i>

41:42.376 --> 41:44.670
Sir, your plane
is waiting at the airport.

41:44.753 --> 41:47.298
We'll have you there
in less than 30 minutes.

42:05.149 --> 42:06.609
Well, I'll be damned.
