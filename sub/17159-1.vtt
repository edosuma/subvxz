WEBVTT

01:08.819 --> 01:10.856
(Footsteps)

01:19.621 --> 01:22.488
- Time to get up, Dad.
- Hmm?

01:29.965 --> 01:31.547
You sleep all right?

01:39.558 --> 01:41.299
People like milky coffee.

01:43.353 --> 01:45.685
Why not put a little grease
in your coffee?

01:48.859 --> 01:50.566
No,Dad.

01:50.694 --> 01:52.355
It sounds gross.

01:53.322 --> 01:56.314
Why not put a little grease
in your java?

01:56.450 --> 01:57.736
Why not try it?

01:59.745 --> 02:01.952
You're such a gross-out, Dad.

02:02.080 --> 02:04.242
I think I might barf.

02:04.374 --> 02:07.082
I'm not saying I wanna do it.

02:08.127 --> 02:12.042
I just wonder why
they haven't tried greasy coffee.

02:14.176 --> 02:15.587
Greasy coffee?

02:18.722 --> 02:21.339
Hey, you probably think
I'm the Greasy Strangler.

02:23.644 --> 02:25.055
I never said that.

02:27.522 --> 02:29.058
Tell you a secret.

02:29.983 --> 02:32.771
I am the Greasy Strangler.

02:35.781 --> 02:37.772
Hey, I call bullshit on that.

02:40.702 --> 02:42.113
OK.

02:42.913 --> 02:45.575
I'm not the Greasy Strangler.

02:47.167 --> 02:49.283
But you're a bullshit artist.

02:51.672 --> 02:53.538
Yeah, I kind of am.

03:38.009 --> 03:39.465
Now, who likes the Bee Gees?

03:41.430 --> 03:45.048
Well, this is where they came up
with that fabulous, spunky song,

03:45.183 --> 03:46.548
"Night Fever".

03:47.978 --> 03:49.889
What do you mean,
"came up with"?

03:50.647 --> 03:53.856
They wrote the lyrics while
they were standing in this doorway.

03:54.943 --> 03:57.685
Why were they standing
in this doorway?

03:57.821 --> 04:00.028
They were waiting
for a friend to pick them up.

04:00.157 --> 04:03.616
They were going out for Chinese
and celebrating his birthday.

04:04.453 --> 04:06.114
Can you verify that, please?

04:06.246 --> 04:08.533
Trust me, I know disco.

04:10.041 --> 04:13.250
I thought free drinks
were included in this tour.

04:13.378 --> 04:18.248
No, there's no free drinks.
I don't know where you got that idea.

04:18.800 --> 04:23.545
- It said in the brochure.
- The information you got is bullshit!

04:24.473 --> 04:28.341
We don't need even fizzy drinks.
Just water would be enough.

04:28.477 --> 04:31.435
You got false information.

04:32.272 --> 04:33.933
We must have free drinks.

04:34.065 --> 04:36.773
No free drinks!

04:36.902 --> 04:39.314
- Free drinks now!
- No free drinks!

04:39.446 --> 04:40.936
Come on, we want free drinks.

04:41.698 --> 04:44.531
- Free drinks.
- We must have free drinks.

04:44.659 --> 04:47.367
No free drinks!

04:47.496 --> 04:49.362
Free drinks! Free drinks!

04:49.498 --> 04:53.082
Free drinks!
Free drinks! Free drinks!

04:53.210 --> 04:55.542
Free drinks! Free drinks! Free drinks!

04:55.670 --> 04:57.752
Free drinks! Free drinks!
Free drinks!

04:57.881 --> 05:00.589
No free drinks!

05:00.717 --> 05:02.674
Frei drinken.

05:03.470 --> 05:06.132
Nichts frei drink.

05:06.932 --> 05:08.923
You must give me free drinks
immediately.

05:09.059 --> 05:10.766
Drop it with the free drinks crap.

05:10.894 --> 05:13.181
We believe in the power of free drinks.

05:13.313 --> 05:14.929
There are no free drinks,

05:15.065 --> 05:17.306
and if you're trying
to rip me a new asshole,

05:17.442 --> 05:19.979
you're making a big mistake.

05:20.445 --> 05:22.777
You are a shitty businessman.
You know that, no?

05:22.906 --> 05:25.238
And you're a bunch of fucking cunts.

05:25.367 --> 05:26.903
Check my cheeks.

05:50.851 --> 05:52.387
I'm sorry.

05:52.519 --> 05:54.886
My dad can get cranky sometimes.

05:55.021 --> 05:57.388
He sure has a temper on him.

05:57.524 --> 05:59.014
Yeah.

05:59.150 --> 06:02.063
He likes to shout. I like to smile.

06:03.363 --> 06:05.695
You cheesy old cornball.

06:05.824 --> 06:08.612
Yeah, that's what I am.

06:08.743 --> 06:10.654
I'm a cheesy old cornball.

06:10.787 --> 06:12.619
(Chuckles)

06:13.206 --> 06:14.492
Yeah, you are.

06:15.292 --> 06:16.999
But that's OK.

06:17.127 --> 06:18.788
I kind of like it.

06:19.421 --> 06:21.162
My name's Brayden.

06:22.924 --> 06:24.961
(Scottish accent) Brayden?

06:25.093 --> 06:26.754
Is that Scottish?

06:27.429 --> 06:30.091
It's not Scottish.
What's your name?

06:31.266 --> 06:32.552
I'm Janet.

06:34.769 --> 06:38.512
Hey, stop talking to the customer
and help Dad with his shorts.

06:55.206 --> 06:59.825
So, Dad, I think I've got a date
with that hot girl from the tour.

06:59.961 --> 07:03.579
No way!
You're a bullshit artist.

07:03.715 --> 07:06.082
No, it's official.

07:06.217 --> 07:08.675
It's all been confirmed.
She likes me.

07:08.803 --> 07:12.216
- She's yanking your chain. Trust rne.
- No, Dad.

07:12.349 --> 07:15.717
She likes my character.
She said so.

07:15.852 --> 07:17.684
And her name's Janet.

07:26.529 --> 07:28.361
That's not right.

07:29.532 --> 07:35.027
I need them greasy
and this is nothing like greasy.

07:36.790 --> 07:37.871
Do you understand?

07:39.125 --> 07:41.366
Too much grease is bad for you.

07:41.503 --> 07:44.370
I read it in a fitness magazine
someone left on the bus.

07:44.506 --> 07:47.089
That's horse shit.
You're a bullshit artist.

07:48.218 --> 07:49.834
We have an agreement.

07:49.970 --> 07:52.758
You stay here, you cook greasy.

07:53.431 --> 07:55.468
And this is not it.

07:56.226 --> 07:59.344
Maybe you should just go live
with your mum and Ricky Prickles.

08:00.522 --> 08:02.479
Dad, don't keep saying that.

08:02.607 --> 08:04.473
You know Ricky Prickles hates me.

08:06.069 --> 08:09.061
Last time I was there,
he called rne Fatty Boom Boom.

08:09.197 --> 08:10.653
(Scoffs)

08:10.782 --> 08:13.069
First, there's this dry food.

08:14.244 --> 08:16.281
Now you're telling me
you got a girlfriend.

08:17.539 --> 08:20.247
Next you're gonna be
leaving the family business.

08:20.375 --> 08:22.332
You must not like me very much.

08:25.130 --> 08:27.622
Is that what this is all about?

08:27.757 --> 08:29.543
I'm sorry, Dad.

08:29.676 --> 08:31.667
I can add more oil if you want.

08:31.803 --> 08:33.840
I'm not hungry anymore.

08:34.931 --> 08:37.673
Dad, I don't wanna leave you.

08:39.269 --> 08:41.260
But I guess I do like Janet.

08:42.272 --> 08:46.266
She might not like me, though,
not when she gets to know rne.

08:47.360 --> 08:49.818
If she gets to know you.

09:11.968 --> 09:14.380
You ask it for chips
and you get nothing.

09:14.512 --> 09:17.004
Yes, you should tell management.

09:17.140 --> 09:20.474
I pay a dollar for the chips,
the chips get stuck,

09:20.602 --> 09:23.469
the manager gets my dollar,
and I get no chips.

09:23.605 --> 09:24.640
Please tell me,

09:24.773 --> 09:27.765
what flavour chips
did you eventually decide upon?

09:27.901 --> 09:29.266
Who cares?

09:29.402 --> 09:31.518
They were paprika ridge chips.

09:32.363 --> 09:33.774
I like the ridges.

09:33.907 --> 09:36.524
I put the tip of my tongue
between ridges,

09:36.659 --> 09:40.368
because that is where
the salty chip dust is.

09:40.497 --> 09:43.330
Yes, that's so true.

09:43.458 --> 09:45.119
I love ridges.

09:45.585 --> 09:48.577
Yes, but what are
these chips made from?

09:48.713 --> 09:50.954
(Rapid, thick accent) Potato.

09:52.592 --> 09:54.549
Excuse me, what?

09:55.345 --> 09:56.881
Potato.

09:57.013 --> 10:00.005
- Can you say that again?
- Potato.

10:01.935 --> 10:05.428
Yes, but what are
these chips made from?

10:06.397 --> 10:07.512
Potato.

10:07.649 --> 10:09.606
- Sorry, but what?
- Potato.

10:10.193 --> 10:13.151
I don't understand.
Can you say that again?

10:13.279 --> 10:15.987
- Potato.
- Please, one more time.

10:16.116 --> 10:17.572
Potato.

10:18.618 --> 10:20.700
OK, this is embarrassing,

10:20.829 --> 10:23.696
but, please, can you say it
a little slower?

10:25.917 --> 10:27.282
Potato.

10:29.462 --> 10:32.545
I am very, very sorry,

10:32.674 --> 10:35.006
but I need to know,

10:35.135 --> 10:37.968
what are these chips made from?

10:38.721 --> 10:40.132
Potato.

10:41.599 --> 10:43.215
- Please, one last time.
- Potato.

10:43.351 --> 10:46.013
I think he's trying to say potato.

10:47.856 --> 10:49.688
Ah, yes.

10:49.816 --> 10:51.477
Potato!

10:51.609 --> 10:53.600
Potato chips.

11:27.729 --> 11:30.141
What on earth is this man doing?

11:31.107 --> 11:34.145
Hey, there are three of us
and one of you, buddy.

11:34.277 --> 11:36.018
Maybe he's not a man.

11:36.863 --> 11:39.571
Maybe he's the boogie-woogie.

11:39.699 --> 11:41.406
Is he the boogie-woogie?

11:49.834 --> 11:51.040
My God!

11:51.169 --> 11:53.456
This man is truly mad.

11:53.588 --> 11:57.331
Who cares? On the count of three,
we'll tackle him.

11:57.467 --> 11:59.549
One, two, three.

12:02.889 --> 12:05.005
(Growling)

12:09.520 --> 12:11.511
I am a rich gentlemen.

12:11.648 --> 12:13.980
I own a premium shipping business
in Denver.

12:14.108 --> 12:19.444
Let rne live.
I will make you the chief shareholder.

12:19.572 --> 12:23.440
You will get a handsome salary
with the attractive corner office.

12:23.576 --> 12:25.738
Does that or does that not
appeal to you?

12:27.789 --> 12:31.123
I wanted some ridged paprika chips.

12:31.251 --> 12:33.037
They weren't even for me.

12:33.628 --> 12:36.086
Who cares?
There is a girl in my room.

12:37.215 --> 12:40.082
I met her tonight at a sports bar.

12:42.053 --> 12:45.136
We tried to have sex
but I couldn't get a stiff y.

12:45.932 --> 12:48.970
Then my balls got sucked up
into my abdomen.

12:51.813 --> 12:54.521
Does it strike you as unusual?

12:57.360 --> 12:59.818
Am I dead yet?

12:59.946 --> 13:02.563
My name is Sidney.

13:17.046 --> 13:18.878
(Screaming)

13:24.929 --> 13:25.919
Ronnie?

13:26.055 --> 13:27.716
Is that you, Big Ronnie?

13:27.849 --> 13:29.806
Oh, yeah, better believe it.

13:29.934 --> 13:31.345
I heard screaming.

13:31.477 --> 13:33.809
All OK back there, Big Ronnie?

13:33.938 --> 13:36.430
Yeah, sure. I was laughing.

13:36.566 --> 13:40.025
Oh, laughing, were you?
Why, did your car get too greasy again?

13:40.153 --> 13:42.986
No comment, but yeah, kind of did.

13:44.282 --> 13:46.319
I like going through the car wash.

13:46.451 --> 13:49.034
It's good to know
my car is getting a good clean.

13:49.162 --> 13:50.778
It's fun.

13:50.913 --> 13:53.871
Oh, and here's ten for the wash.

13:54.709 --> 13:57.747
And I'm gonna go use your bathroom.

13:57.879 --> 13:59.665
Oh, you go right ahead, Big Ronnie.

14:52.600 --> 14:54.557
Ronnie's back.

14:54.685 --> 14:58.394
Let's go disco dancing
again soon, Big Ronnie.

14:59.482 --> 15:03.942
Yeah, that's not a bad idea.
We could disco dance. Why not?

15:04.070 --> 15:06.983
We used to disco dance
all the time.

15:07.115 --> 15:09.482
I guess you got too busy lately.

15:09.617 --> 15:12.780
Ah, well, it's a little embarrassing,

15:12.912 --> 15:15.153
but my son's having problems.

15:15.289 --> 15:16.905
What kind of problems, Big Ronnie?

15:17.041 --> 15:18.452
Between you and me,

15:18.584 --> 15:21.246
I think my son's
a severe manic depressive.

15:21.379 --> 15:23.370
He should be on medication.

15:23.506 --> 15:26.294
And did I tell you
he still craps the bed most nights?

15:27.468 --> 15:28.833
On, boy.

15:28.970 --> 15:30.051
Uh-Oh.

15:30.179 --> 15:31.590
No, you did not.

15:31.722 --> 15:34.760
Yeah, and he craps on the carpet.

15:34.892 --> 15:37.054
I've found it in the kitchen.

15:37.186 --> 15:40.395
Hell, he even crapped
on top of the TV last week.

15:41.023 --> 15:43.731
Anyway, thanks for the scrub.

15:43.860 --> 15:46.648
OK, Big Ronnie.
Catch you again soon, I hope.

15:47.905 --> 15:49.521
Bye-bye, Big Paul.

15:49.657 --> 15:51.489
Bye-bye, Big Ronnie.

15:51.617 --> 15:53.028
(Laughing)

16:08.801 --> 16:10.587
Morning, Dad.

16:10.720 --> 16:12.210
Go away.

16:12.972 --> 16:15.054
Someone's a grouch today.

16:16.058 --> 16:17.969
Oh, you don't care.

16:19.937 --> 16:21.393
What does that mean?

16:26.611 --> 16:28.898
Oh, now that you got a girlfriend,

16:29.030 --> 16:30.987
you're probably gonna
wanna move out.

16:31.449 --> 16:32.905
Bullshit artist.

16:33.034 --> 16:35.116
We haven't even had our first date.

16:35.244 --> 16:37.451
Look, I know women.

16:37.580 --> 16:39.947
She'll want you all to herself.

16:40.082 --> 16:41.368
She looked greedy.

16:42.168 --> 16:44.159
She looked nice to me.

16:45.546 --> 16:48.208
You'll leave
and I'll die of loneliness.

16:49.842 --> 16:51.128
People do that, you know.

16:51.886 --> 16:55.880
They get so lonely,
their heart stops and they die.

16:56.682 --> 16:58.423
But you won't care.

16:58.559 --> 17:02.393
You'll be too busy making love.

17:02.522 --> 17:03.933
(Sobbing)

17:08.027 --> 17:09.893
Cut it out, Dad.

17:10.029 --> 17:12.145
Quit goofing off.

17:12.990 --> 17:15.152
(Both laugh)

17:19.747 --> 17:21.829
I'm not going anywhere, Dad.

17:21.958 --> 17:23.915
You know how I am
with the ladies.

17:24.460 --> 17:27.248
But seriously, I have something
I need to tell you.

17:27.380 --> 17:29.462
- Come here.
- Go for it, Dad.

17:29.590 --> 17:31.797
- Are you ready?
- Yes. What is it?

17:33.803 --> 17:34.793
(Farts)

17:41.936 --> 17:44.974
I'm making these bacon rolls
real greasy, Dad.

17:45.481 --> 17:46.846
Bullshit artist.

17:46.983 --> 17:48.394
Am not.

17:48.526 --> 17:49.607
Bullshit.

17:49.735 --> 17:51.351
You make this the greasiest feast

17:51.487 --> 17:53.478
since that goose
you cooked on Christmas.

17:57.618 --> 18:00.155
Done and done, Dad.

18:21.726 --> 18:26.095
And now,
this very store here

18:26.230 --> 18:29.689
is where Kool
from "Kool and the Gang" worked

18:29.817 --> 18:33.481
before he exploded
onto the disco scene.

18:36.949 --> 18:40.567
Anyway, this is the end
of Big Ronnie's Disco Tour.

18:40.703 --> 18:44.492
Thank you very much for coming
and, er, come again soon.

18:59.555 --> 19:02.673
So, where are you taking me
tonight, Mister?

19:03.809 --> 19:05.925
How about a sizzling Cajun hotpot?

19:06.062 --> 19:08.679
What about me?
Who's gonna cook for me?

19:08.814 --> 19:11.932
- I'm hungry.
- You'll have to go to a vendor, Dad.

19:12.068 --> 19:14.856
- You'll have to go get a dog.
- Not a real dog.

19:14.987 --> 19:17.024
Yeah, don't bite into a real dog.

19:17.156 --> 19:19.147
Don't bite into a... woof-woof.

19:19.283 --> 19:20.489
Woof!

19:22.119 --> 19:25.328
OK, you two can fuck off tonight.

19:25.456 --> 19:26.446
Bye, Dad.

19:26.582 --> 19:27.947
Bye-bye.

19:28.084 --> 19:29.995
Bye-bye!

19:30.127 --> 19:31.583
Fucking cunts!

19:39.887 --> 19:44.597
I could feast on that queen's ass
all night long.

19:59.448 --> 20:02.486
Thanks, Big Heiny.
Looking forward to a great meal.

20:02.618 --> 20:04.154
Of course, of course.

20:11.961 --> 20:16.706
I think I read once that these kinds
of breadstick are called grissini.

20:21.971 --> 20:22.961
Probably.

20:27.268 --> 20:30.226
So, um, does your mum
live with you too?

20:31.605 --> 20:33.221
<i>No.</i>

20:33.357 --> 20:35.223
She left when I was small.

20:36.193 --> 20:37.775
She met someone new.

20:38.863 --> 20:40.194
Well, that's crapola.

20:41.866 --> 20:43.197
Yeah.

20:43.325 --> 20:44.986
His name is Ricky Prickles.

20:46.203 --> 20:48.365
He's a professional sports coach.

20:48.497 --> 20:51.535
He's got the most defined six-pack
I've ever seen.

20:51.667 --> 20:54.204
Ooh. Tell this girl more.

20:56.422 --> 20:59.005
I went to stay
with Mum and Ricky once.

20:59.133 --> 21:01.249
He made me punch him
in his six-pack.

21:03.137 --> 21:06.380
He didn't feel anything
because the muscles were so hard.

21:07.516 --> 21:11.510
It was like punching a vacuum-packed
bag of roasted sausages.

21:13.105 --> 21:15.642
Then he made rne do
abdominal crunches with him.

21:17.610 --> 21:19.977
I barfed all over his carpet.

21:20.112 --> 21:22.900
My barf was real orange
and tasted fizzy.

21:24.950 --> 21:27.863
Ricky Prickles was so mad,

21:27.995 --> 21:30.908
he smacked me twice in the face
with the flat of his hand.

21:33.250 --> 21:35.287
Ricky the Pricky.

21:35.419 --> 21:37.126
Then he molested me.

21:38.756 --> 21:40.167
Sexually harassed me.

21:42.802 --> 21:44.338
How old were you?

21:44.470 --> 21:45.926
Eighteen.

21:46.972 --> 21:49.760
I had long golden hair
and a soft moustache.

21:51.101 --> 21:54.514
I've never been able to do
muscle curls or abdominal crunches.

21:57.399 --> 21:59.766
Not all girls like ripped-up abs.

22:00.945 --> 22:02.606
Yeah.

22:02.738 --> 22:04.900
Some girls like loyal hearts.

22:19.046 --> 22:20.912
Janet, what's wrong?

22:23.926 --> 22:24.961
Please, Janet.

22:26.887 --> 22:29.470
The tourists I was with the other day
were murdered.

22:31.600 --> 22:33.136
Hey, hey, hey, hey-

22:33.269 --> 22:34.885
Hey, hey, hey.

22:35.020 --> 22:37.182
Hey, hey, hey, hey, he)'-

22:43.028 --> 22:44.314
You're cute.

22:49.660 --> 22:51.526
If I'm cute,

22:51.662 --> 22:53.573
you're stunningly beautiful.

23:21.275 --> 23:23.357
How can I help you, sir?

23:23.485 --> 23:25.647
I wanna dog. Give me a dog.

23:25.779 --> 23:30.148
One famous dog coming up.
I'll make yours extra picante, yeah?

23:36.332 --> 23:41.623
That'll be uno, dos, tres bucks.

23:42.880 --> 23:44.621
What the fuck is this shit?

23:45.674 --> 23:48.792
This is one famous chilli cheese dog.

23:48.928 --> 23:51.260
No, this isn't right.

23:51.388 --> 23:54.380
I need more grease on this.
I need more oil.

23:54.516 --> 23:56.348
Sir, I cannot do that.

23:56.477 --> 23:59.515
It's against regulations.
I could lose my licence.

23:59.647 --> 24:01.388
I need this oily.

24:01.523 --> 24:04.436
I need this to lubricate the world.

24:04.568 --> 24:09.153
I need this dog
to have some grease on it,

24:09.281 --> 24:14.196
so when I eat it
the grease will lubricate my throat.

24:14.787 --> 24:17.199
Sir, I cannot do that.

24:17.331 --> 24:19.368
It's not safe to use too much oil.

24:19.500 --> 24:24.119
I could... I repeat,
I could lose my licence.

24:25.798 --> 24:29.132
You probably think
I'm the Greasy Strangler.

24:29.259 --> 24:32.092
That's why you won't grease my dog.

24:43.232 --> 24:45.223
Hey, what are you doing?

24:45.359 --> 24:48.568
You're not allowed to touch that.
That's dangerous equipment.

24:48.696 --> 24:51.905
You could burn yourself.
I could lose my licence.

24:52.032 --> 24:55.696
I'm gonna dunk Big Ronnie's dog
all the way in.

25:01.208 --> 25:03.119
This dog is fully dunked.

25:23.647 --> 25:26.264
I wanna write fantasy novels someday.

25:27.693 --> 25:31.357
Interactive fables
with full colour illustrations

25:31.488 --> 25:34.150
and fold-out maps of faraway realms.

25:35.617 --> 25:38.655
I'd narrate the tales myself
for the audiobooks.

25:39.329 --> 25:41.787
I'd do all the voices
for the characters,

25:41.915 --> 25:44.077
even the dragons and trolls.

25:45.169 --> 25:47.160
What will the book be called?

25:47.880 --> 25:50.872
The first one is going to be called
"The Amulet of Arg".

25:51.842 --> 25:55.255
Arg is the reluctant keeper
of the trolls' realm.

25:56.263 --> 25:59.301
In the second book,
he crosses over to the digital realm

25:59.433 --> 26:01.015
to become the digi-troll.

26:02.895 --> 26:07.355
In the third book, he fulfils his destiny
as the Lord of the Three Realms.

26:08.233 --> 26:10.099
He has the largest amulet.

26:13.530 --> 26:16.113
I bet you have
a pretty large amulet yourself.

26:19.536 --> 26:21.368
I don't own an amulet.

26:24.625 --> 26:27.492
You're a real change of pace for rne
after guys like Rico.

26:28.587 --> 26:30.328
He was all fingers.

26:52.694 --> 26:54.810
I didn't say you could do that.

26:58.951 --> 27:00.783
Hey, where's my dad?

28:04.766 --> 28:06.552
(Screaming)

28:41.303 --> 28:42.293
(Belches)

28:50.395 --> 28:52.136
Ronnie?
Is that you, Ronnie?

28:54.358 --> 28:55.689
Why, yes it is.

28:55.817 --> 28:57.808
It's me, Ronnie.

28:58.487 --> 29:01.400
You must be driving some oily roads.

29:01.531 --> 29:03.898
You're getting a lot of car washes
these days.

29:04.868 --> 29:06.654
What are you implying, Paul?

29:06.787 --> 29:08.198
Oh, nothing.

29:08.330 --> 29:11.618
Just making a pleasantry,
that's all, Ronnie.

29:11.750 --> 29:13.206
Just a pleasantry.

29:14.086 --> 29:15.167
You ever hear those?

29:15.295 --> 29:17.787
Next time keep it to yourself, OK?

29:17.923 --> 29:20.085
I'm not the Greasy Strangler.

29:22.010 --> 29:23.546
I never said you were, Ronnie.

29:23.679 --> 29:26.467
I'm not the Greasy Strangler.

29:26.598 --> 29:28.305
(Laughing)

30:00.382 --> 30:02.043
All right, Big Brayden.

30:02.175 --> 30:05.133
- Hey, Oinker.
- You ready to hit the Horror House?

30:05.595 --> 30:09.338
Hey, you didn't tell me
you were out tonight.

30:09.474 --> 30:11.932
Two nights in a row
is not permitted,

30:12.060 --> 30:14.301
unless I come with you.

30:14.396 --> 30:17.013
Or I could evict you.

30:17.149 --> 30:20.187
Dad, I told you this morning.

30:20.319 --> 30:24.938
- You were too groggy to pay attention.
- Or too stoned on fart fumes.

30:25.073 --> 30:28.407
Brayden told rne you trumped
a real humdinger the other day.

30:28.535 --> 30:31.368
He said you cut
the world's biggest cheese.

30:31.496 --> 30:34.204
He said his eyes were watering.

30:41.089 --> 30:44.172
I'm joining you
at the Horror House tonight.

30:44.301 --> 30:46.087
I'm free tonight,

30:46.219 --> 30:49.257
so I'm coming with you
to the Horror House.

30:49.389 --> 30:50.550
But Dad!

30:52.100 --> 30:55.764
If you don't let me come,
I'm going to tell Janet

30:55.896 --> 31:00.606
that you haven't even stuck one finger
up a girl's pussy yet, OK?

31:03.320 --> 31:06.028
Oinker, where did you get
those shoes?

31:08.033 --> 31:12.368
I'm renting them,
and I'm absolutely loving it.

31:13.038 --> 31:15.075
<i>_</i> (snorts)
<i>_</i> (snorts)

31:16.625 --> 31:18.707
Very good shoes, Oinker.

31:25.926 --> 31:28.839
Three tickets for the Horror House,
please, Big Thaddeus.

31:28.970 --> 31:30.631
Sure thing, Big Brayden.

31:33.350 --> 31:36.684
Popcorn.
I need a big bucket of popcorn.

31:39.981 --> 31:42.348
No, this isn't right.

31:42.484 --> 31:44.225
I need more grease on this.

32:07.050 --> 32:07.881
<i>HEY-</i>

32:10.637 --> 32:12.344
You! Hey, hey, hey!

32:16.435 --> 32:18.551
(Ronnie) Grease! Grease!
Grease! Grease!

32:31.283 --> 32:32.489
- Dad.
- What?

32:32.617 --> 32:34.824
Janet is coming over tonight.

32:34.953 --> 32:36.739
We're making baguettes for dinner.

32:36.872 --> 32:39.910
They're long French bread sticks
filled with melted mozzarella

32:40.041 --> 32:42.499
and lardons,
which are ham cubes.

32:42.627 --> 32:45.085
Janet went to France last year.

32:45.213 --> 32:47.250
She fell in love with the food.

32:47.382 --> 32:49.498
Is it OK if she comes tonight, Dad?

32:51.803 --> 32:56.172
OK, disco people, do you remember
the Earth, the Wind and the Fire?

32:56.850 --> 33:01.845
Did you know that all three of them
lived in that apartment up there?

33:18.205 --> 33:22.790
I've been making my own olive oil
in my bedroom.

33:24.336 --> 33:25.872
Extra virgin.

33:44.940 --> 33:46.305
(Unzipping)

34:11.591 --> 34:12.752
Like this?

34:14.219 --> 34:16.051
Like this, Janet?

34:17.389 --> 34:20.097
I don't know
if I'm doing it right, Janet.

34:20.225 --> 34:22.431
I don't know if I'm doing it right,
Janet

34:23.478 --> 34:24.764
Like this?

34:24.896 --> 34:26.351
Is this right?

34:26.481 --> 34:27.471
Janet?

34:28.065 --> 34:30.683
I don't know
if I'm doing it right, Janet.

34:30.819 --> 34:32.230
Like this?

34:32.362 --> 34:33.523
(sighing)

35:07.897 --> 35:10.389
- Good morning, Ronnie.
- It is now.

35:12.652 --> 35:15.064
Do you got any disco tours
lined up for today?

35:15.196 --> 35:16.482
Maybe.

35:17.991 --> 35:20.153
Do you like oily grapefruit?

35:55.820 --> 35:57.310
(Slurping)

36:11.294 --> 36:12.750
(Peeing)

36:26.601 --> 36:28.183
(Stops peeing)

36:28.311 --> 36:29.301
Hello?

36:33.149 --> 36:34.139
Who's there?

36:36.986 --> 36:38.226
Brayden, is that you?

36:40.657 --> 36:43.615
No, it's Ronnie, Brayden's dad.

36:45.328 --> 36:46.318
<i>Oh.</i>

36:47.706 --> 36:48.912
Everything OK?

36:49.040 --> 36:51.782
Yeah. I wanted to watch you go pee.

36:53.670 --> 36:55.536
Peeing is private.

36:56.840 --> 36:58.626
Yeah, usually.

36:58.758 --> 37:00.374
But I got teeth to brush.

37:08.727 --> 37:10.593
Go ahead, keep peeing.
I won't look.

37:15.984 --> 37:18.476
(Resumes peeing)

37:19.279 --> 37:21.691
I thought you weren't gonna look.

37:44.220 --> 37:46.086
Hey, beautiful Janet.

37:46.222 --> 37:47.303
Oh, hey, Brayden.

37:49.559 --> 37:51.015
Are we exclusive?

37:52.437 --> 37:54.895
Because my dad said
he watched you go pee.

38:00.195 --> 38:02.277
Excuse me, I'm talking to you.

38:05.408 --> 38:06.990
OK, I get it.

38:07.118 --> 38:09.325
We're playing a sort
of silent game, right?

38:11.998 --> 38:13.284
Do you like me?

38:16.836 --> 38:18.452
Are you a bullshit artist?

38:28.056 --> 38:31.014
I don't know what to think
about anything right now.

38:31.142 --> 38:32.428
You're amazing.

39:01.047 --> 39:03.254
(Groaning)

39:26.322 --> 39:28.438
I'm... dying-

39:28.575 --> 39:31.738
I'm actually... dying.

39:36.374 --> 39:38.456
(Choking) Things are getting brighter.

39:40.336 --> 39:42.247
Now they're getting slightly darker.

39:46.968 --> 39:47.958
Sorry, mate.

39:48.595 --> 39:51.007
I blacked out there.

39:52.265 --> 39:54.552
Part of the dying process, I reckon.

39:55.518 --> 39:56.508
<i>Oh.</i>

39:56.644 --> 39:58.134
(Growling)

39:58.605 --> 40:01.688
Fuck me, this is amazing!

40:03.318 --> 40:04.353
(Snorting)

40:43.066 --> 40:45.808
I've been thinking
I should spend some time with Janet.

40:45.944 --> 40:47.685
Why, Dad?

40:48.237 --> 40:51.821
I know women.
I don't want to see you get hurt, OK?

40:51.950 --> 40:55.284
I should spend some time
getting to know her, alone.

40:56.037 --> 40:59.371
Yeah, so you can be a smoothie to her
and make her love you.

41:00.708 --> 41:01.698
Bullshit.

41:03.252 --> 41:06.586
I just know a lot more about women
than you do.

41:06.714 --> 41:08.204
Women like me.

41:09.092 --> 41:11.333
Yeah? Why did Mum leave, then?

41:11.803 --> 41:15.922
She left because you used to get
into her bed and poop all over her leg.

41:16.057 --> 41:17.968
That's a lie and you know it.

41:18.768 --> 41:20.475
Sorry, it's not.

41:20.603 --> 41:23.436
She yelled it from a moving car
when she was leaving.

41:23.564 --> 41:24.850
Bullshit artist.

41:24.983 --> 41:28.351
You mean, meeting Ricky Prickles
with his ripped-up abdominal muscles

41:28.486 --> 41:30.318
had nothing to do with her leaving?

41:30.446 --> 41:33.313
That's it for you, Colonel Crapper.

41:33.449 --> 41:36.987
- Sergeant Shizzly, you're evicted.
- Dad!

41:37.120 --> 41:40.613
You've only got three and a half hours
to vacate the property.

41:40.748 --> 41:41.738
No!

41:43.251 --> 41:46.994
OK, you're not really evicted,
but you will be,

41:47.130 --> 41:50.998
if you don't let rne spend some time
getting to know Janet.

41:51.134 --> 41:54.422
But she seems nice.
She seems like a nice, true girl.

41:55.013 --> 41:58.256
I don't want this cunt
to fuck you up and leave you lonely.

42:00.059 --> 42:02.175
OK, fine, take her out.

42:03.146 --> 42:05.137
I guess it could help.

42:05.273 --> 42:06.889
I trust you, Dad.

42:09.152 --> 42:11.519
I'm Big Ronnie and I'm back!

42:20.788 --> 42:23.155
Where are you taking her?

42:24.459 --> 42:27.542
Oh, this little night club
I took your mother to once.

42:28.379 --> 42:29.790
Is it romantic?

42:30.590 --> 42:33.924
Put it this way.
Is it exclusive? You bet it is.

42:34.427 --> 42:38.261
Are there expensive
high-quality creme cocktails?

42:38.389 --> 42:40.300
What the fuck do you think?

42:43.144 --> 42:46.387
I'm expecting to run up
a formidable bar bill tonight.

42:47.398 --> 42:53.940
15 bucks for a luxuriously creamy
pussy-ass daiquiri, motherfuckers.

42:55.490 --> 42:57.447
That's kind of pricey for a drink.

42:58.242 --> 42:59.653
It's not a drink.

43:00.495 --> 43:02.111
It's liquid sex.

43:04.332 --> 43:06.539
Just don't be a smoothie with her.

43:06.667 --> 43:08.249
I really like this girl.

43:09.087 --> 43:11.203
You can be a smoothie with women.

43:11.339 --> 43:12.500
Bullshit artist.

43:12.632 --> 43:14.999
Dad, you're a smoothie.

43:15.134 --> 43:16.966
- Am not.
- Are too.

43:18.137 --> 43:20.128
Well, kind of am.

43:22.433 --> 43:26.097
You called bullshit,
and you were right.

43:36.030 --> 43:38.192
(Sobbing)

43:47.125 --> 43:48.832
(Disco music)

44:40.011 --> 44:42.252
Tell rne more about yourself.

44:42.388 --> 44:44.345
I used to run a night club.

44:44.473 --> 44:47.340
I booked all the disco acts.
I knew them personally.

44:48.102 --> 44:51.561
One time, I had to drive
Michael Jackson to the airport,

44:51.689 --> 44:54.932
and on the way we decided
to stop at this little blues club,

44:55.067 --> 44:58.435
because he wanted to kick back
with a bottle of wine and a cigar.

44:58.571 --> 45:02.530
It was a quiet night.
He was eating these delicious nachos.

45:02.658 --> 45:04.114
And I broke into the DJ booth

45:04.243 --> 45:06.701
and I put "Smooth Criminal"
on the sound system.

45:07.455 --> 45:09.662
I wanted to boogie
and so did Michael.

45:09.790 --> 45:11.701
He got up and started
dancing on the table

45:11.834 --> 45:14.576
and this security guard came up
and tried to take him down,

45:14.712 --> 45:16.419
so I punched him the fuck out.

45:16.547 --> 45:20.006
And then this other guy comes up
and Michael hit him.

45:20.134 --> 45:22.842
He hit him so hard, his hair fell out.

45:22.970 --> 45:25.587
And then these two Korean twins
came on to us

45:25.723 --> 45:28.181
so we took them
into the manager's office

45:28.309 --> 45:30.425
and we started pumping away at them.

45:30.561 --> 45:32.893
And Michael and I were
just pumping and pumping

45:33.022 --> 45:36.060
and then we sprayed them
with hot, milky cum

45:36.192 --> 45:37.648
and everybody applauded.

45:39.111 --> 45:42.649
Then he gave me one of his gloves
and I drove him to the airport.

45:42.782 --> 45:45.865
He was going to Home
for some top-secret meeting.

45:49.789 --> 45:50.779
Wow.

45:51.415 --> 45:53.497
You must have had
some amazing adventures.

45:55.086 --> 45:58.545
I should have had more
but I had Brayden to raise.

45:59.382 --> 46:01.965
He was a horrible kid,
crying all the time.

46:02.843 --> 46:04.880
His mother left
because he was so horrible.

46:05.680 --> 46:09.674
He's never had a girlfriend
because he craps the bed most nights.

46:09.809 --> 46:12.551
I was 16 when I had him.

46:12.687 --> 46:16.100
I was a kid with a bed-crapping kid.

46:20.987 --> 46:22.944
- I can't do that, mister.
- Why not?

46:24.156 --> 46:25.817
Oh, no reason.

46:27.201 --> 46:29.283
I think I might be in love
with your son.

46:29.412 --> 46:31.653
You're in love with Brayden?

46:31.789 --> 46:32.779
Yeah.

46:33.666 --> 46:34.952
Huh!

46:35.084 --> 46:37.291
Kiss my juicy cherry lips.

46:40.506 --> 46:41.962
I can't do that.

46:43.634 --> 46:45.124
It feels weird.

46:46.554 --> 46:48.090
Bullshit artist!

47:04.989 --> 47:06.525
(Dance music)

47:58.751 --> 48:00.583
(Music stops)

48:28.989 --> 48:31.481
Nothing happened, I promise.

48:33.119 --> 48:34.530
I believe you.

48:36.330 --> 48:37.912
We just talked.

48:38.040 --> 48:41.328
He told me about his nights
with Michael Jackson.

48:42.128 --> 48:45.621
That wasn't the real Michael Jackson
he was friends with.

48:45.756 --> 48:50.000
That was an MJ lookalike who used
to cruise Hollywood as a male prostitute.

48:51.595 --> 48:53.256
He shot himself recently.

48:54.181 --> 48:56.798
He put a gun to his head
in the middle of the street.

48:57.685 --> 49:00.473
They say the bullet
folded his head in half.

49:05.818 --> 49:07.434
Can I ask you something?

49:08.571 --> 49:11.563
Is my dad a smoothie?
Did he get smooth on you?

49:16.245 --> 49:18.236
(Phone rings)

49:22.751 --> 49:25.914
- Hello.
- (Man) 'Oh, I got some bad news.

49:26.046 --> 49:27.662
'Oinker is dead.'

49:29.133 --> 49:31.500
OK, so now I'm shit scared, Janet.

49:31.635 --> 49:33.046
(Police siren)

49:52.156 --> 49:55.444
(Brayden) That's him, all right.
That's my best friend.

49:58.621 --> 50:01.864
I need a time-out.
Let's go to the table.

50:19.141 --> 50:20.927
What are you thinking, Brayden?

50:22.102 --> 50:26.266
I'm thinking I'm going to investigate
the Greasy Strangler killings myself.

50:27.066 --> 50:28.227
No, Brayden.

50:29.151 --> 50:31.267
That's too dangerous.

50:31.946 --> 50:35.155
I'm not afraid of dying,
if that's what you mean.

50:35.282 --> 50:37.068
I'm gonna find the Greasy Strangler.

50:37.993 --> 50:40.200
He brutally murdered the Indian guy.

50:40.329 --> 50:42.070
He brutally murdered Oinker.

50:42.206 --> 50:45.540
I'm gonna make sure
he never murders anyone else.

50:45.668 --> 50:48.956
I'm gonna expose the Greasy Strangler.
Then I'm gonna kill him.

50:53.259 --> 50:55.250
(Howls)

51:21.453 --> 51:22.943
What are you doing, Bray-Bray?

51:24.999 --> 51:26.706
Gathering evidence.

51:29.837 --> 51:31.623
I'm falling for you.

51:31.755 --> 51:35.339
I'm falling for you hard and fast
and I'm shit scared.

51:35.467 --> 51:36.878
I'm shit scared right now.

51:39.221 --> 51:41.804
I've got to expose
the Greasy Strangler.

52:12.087 --> 52:16.081
This is delicious.
What's on this toast?

52:17.217 --> 52:19.504
Just oil, like you normally have.

52:22.056 --> 52:23.797
Bullshit artist.

52:23.932 --> 52:26.515
This isn't the oil we usually use.

52:26.644 --> 52:28.351
Is it?

52:28.479 --> 52:30.561
Let's just say it's new oil.

52:32.274 --> 52:33.730
Where did you get it?

52:34.610 --> 52:36.692
I think you have an idea
where I got it, Dad.

52:38.238 --> 52:41.356
I think you know exactly
where I got this delicious oil.

52:45.371 --> 52:46.782
(Growling)

52:56.090 --> 52:58.377
- 'Hello?'
- Janet, it's me.

52:58.509 --> 53:02.548
- 'What's going on?'
- Oh, nothing much, just losing my mind.

53:02.680 --> 53:05.422
I think my dad might be
the Greasy Strangler.

53:05.557 --> 53:10.176
- 'Do you want rne to come over?'
- No, don't come over. It's too dangerous.

53:10.312 --> 53:12.724
I couldn't bear to lose you.

53:12.856 --> 53:15.439
I yearn for you
but I have to protect you now.

53:16.652 --> 53:18.609
Let's have phone sex quickly.

53:19.613 --> 53:22.776
Imagine me stroking your clitoris
with a pink feather

53:22.908 --> 53:24.239
and then you cradle my sack.

53:24.368 --> 53:26.484
- 'I'm tickling your sack.'
- Yes!

53:29.915 --> 53:31.656
Come on, Rodney.

53:31.792 --> 53:32.998
Play the game.

53:36.547 --> 53:38.208
<i>Oh, oh, oh...</i>

53:51.812 --> 53:52.893
Ooh.

53:57.276 --> 53:58.687
'Aah.'

53:59.653 --> 54:01.189
OK, bye.

54:08.662 --> 54:11.745
Dad, we need to talk.

54:12.833 --> 54:14.198
Dad?

54:15.711 --> 54:19.124
Ronnie, is that you?
I hope it is.

54:20.966 --> 54:22.957
Let's disco.

54:23.552 --> 54:26.169
Oh, yeah, the disco kings are back.

54:26.305 --> 54:27.887
Yep, you called it.

54:29.266 --> 54:30.427
(Farts)

54:31.852 --> 54:33.263
Fuck.

54:33.395 --> 54:34.601
Oh, fuck.

54:53.749 --> 54:55.990
Tonight we're going disco-dancing.

54:56.126 --> 54:58.538
We're gonna hit the club circuit
with a vengeance.

54:58.670 --> 55:01.458
Can I come?
I could use a boogie-woogie.

55:02.549 --> 55:03.880
I've got the blues.

55:05.010 --> 55:06.842
I don't know.
What do you think, Paul?

55:06.970 --> 55:08.961
Shall we bring my son along?

55:09.556 --> 55:11.046
No way!

55:11.183 --> 55:13.015
Absolutely not, Ronnie.

55:14.895 --> 55:15.976
Sorry.

56:02.985 --> 56:06.103
Yeah, I told you
he was a manic depressive.

56:06.238 --> 56:07.649
He seems very depressed.

56:07.781 --> 56:09.522
Yeah, he needs to be on meds,
you know.

56:09.658 --> 56:11.774
He was on meds
when he was a kid.

56:11.910 --> 56:15.574
They were brightly coloured pills
with fruity flavours.

56:15.706 --> 56:18.164
Meds for sad kids.

56:18.292 --> 56:19.498
(Both laugh)

57:12.512 --> 57:14.549
(Ringing tone)

57:26.944 --> 57:28.105
(Janet) 'Hello?'

57:28.236 --> 57:29.522
Come over now.

57:29.655 --> 57:31.271
I'm shit scared.

57:31.406 --> 57:32.612
I love you.

57:36.286 --> 57:38.072
Oh, I feel so sexy.

57:39.581 --> 57:42.744
But seriously,
imagine if I farted now.

57:52.719 --> 57:54.551
I'm scared, Janet.

58:05.524 --> 58:09.893
Hey, you look deliciously sexy tonight.

58:10.028 --> 58:11.143
Thank you.

58:12.114 --> 58:14.651
- How was your night?
- It was terrific.

58:14.783 --> 58:19.402
We danced a lot and we had
a lot of really creamy cocktails.

58:19.538 --> 58:22.530
A lot of cows got milked
so we could have fun tonight.

58:23.625 --> 58:28.119
Their teats supplied the creamy milk
that was in our cocktails tonight.

58:28.255 --> 58:29.541
Trust me.

58:30.757 --> 58:34.546
Oh, really? Did you spray any girls
with that hot, milky cum?

58:35.721 --> 58:38.133
Well, that's kind of top secret.

58:44.563 --> 58:47.521
Wanna come in
and do something sensual?

59:37.407 --> 59:39.364
Feels good, la?

59:43.580 --> 59:45.617
(Sobbing)

59:55.592 --> 59:57.583
I'm guessing we fucked all night.

01:00:07.062 --> 01:00:09.099
Looks like a massive mouse's head.

01:00:09.231 --> 01:00:11.313
(Both laugh)

01:00:24.246 --> 01:00:26.578
I'm officially dating Janet.

01:00:27.666 --> 01:00:31.375
We made it official last night.
We sealed it with a kiss.

01:00:31.503 --> 01:00:32.834
Bullshit artist.

01:00:33.964 --> 01:00:36.877
Janet and I are exclusive.

01:00:37.008 --> 01:00:39.921
There's no reason
to talk of this anymore.

01:00:40.053 --> 01:00:48.053
- Bullshit artist.
- Bullshit artist.

01:00:50.564 --> 01:00:54.102
- Bullshit artist.
- You, sir, are a horse-shit artist.

01:00:54.234 --> 01:00:55.816
I call bullshit on that.

01:01:10.959 --> 01:01:14.953
I'm detecting the unmistakable scent of...

01:01:18.800 --> 01:01:19.961
Wait for it.

01:01:21.303 --> 01:01:23.044
Horse shit?

01:01:23.180 --> 01:01:25.592
No, your answer is completely wrong.

01:01:25.724 --> 01:01:27.260
The correct answer is...

01:01:36.818 --> 01:01:38.308
What's the correct answer?

01:01:41.740 --> 01:01:42.730
Wait.

01:01:45.869 --> 01:01:47.485
Tell me the correct answer.

01:01:47.621 --> 01:01:49.362
The correct answer is...

01:02:00.050 --> 01:02:01.256
Horse shit.

01:02:01.384 --> 01:02:05.423
- That's what I said, Dad.
- Ah, bullshit.

01:02:05.555 --> 01:02:07.262
You're covered in horse shit.

01:02:07.390 --> 01:02:10.052
Bull-shit art-ist.

01:02:11.061 --> 01:02:14.804
You're officially the world's
biggest bullshit and horse-shit artist.

01:02:14.940 --> 01:02:17.307
Bullshit. Horse shit.

01:02:17.442 --> 01:02:19.900
Cat shit. Tiger shit.

01:02:20.028 --> 01:02:22.611
Lion shit. Duck shit.

01:02:22.739 --> 01:02:25.527
Walrus shit. Penguin shit.

01:02:25.659 --> 01:02:27.991
King Penguin shit.

01:02:28.119 --> 01:02:30.702
B, U, double I,

01:02:30.830 --> 01:02:33.913
S, H, I, T,

01:02:34.042 --> 01:02:36.158
new word,

01:02:36.294 --> 01:02:40.504
<i>A, R, T, I, S,T</i>

01:02:40.632 --> 01:02:43.545
spells bullshit artist.

01:02:43.677 --> 01:02:47.215
I say again, bullshit artist.

01:02:47.347 --> 01:02:49.679
Bully, bully, bullshit.

01:02:53.353 --> 01:02:56.141
Janet was mine first.
She loved me only.

01:03:00.777 --> 01:03:03.314
Well, I call bullshit on that one,

01:03:03.446 --> 01:03:05.938
because last night I claimed her pussy.

01:03:11.955 --> 01:03:15.573
Oh, you claimed her pussy
but you never claimed her heart.

01:03:20.130 --> 01:03:23.213
Don't make me evict you.

01:03:23.341 --> 01:03:26.424
I'm getting really close

01:03:26.553 --> 01:03:30.638
to throwing your whiney ass
out of my house forever.

01:04:03.923 --> 01:04:05.664
This pasta is perfect.

01:04:08.178 --> 01:04:11.671
This is officially the best meal
you have ever cooked.

01:04:11.806 --> 01:04:13.797
Just the right amount of oil.

01:04:13.933 --> 01:04:15.139
Thanks.

01:04:16.770 --> 01:04:18.556
You could serve this pasta

01:04:18.688 --> 01:04:22.397
at any premium restaurant
on the Sunset Strip.

01:04:22.525 --> 01:04:23.560
Yeah.

01:04:24.652 --> 01:04:27.235
It's called farfalle,

01:04:27.364 --> 01:04:29.401
shaped like a bow-tie.

01:04:29.532 --> 01:04:30.738
I know.

01:04:32.660 --> 01:04:34.446
And the best part is,

01:04:34.579 --> 01:04:37.617
it's fantabulously greasy.

01:04:40.335 --> 01:04:41.746
<i>Bravo.</i>

01:04:43.046 --> 01:04:46.255
I normally shoot
about six ropes of cum

01:04:46.383 --> 01:04:48.750
and dribble a little of the clear stuff,

01:04:48.885 --> 01:04:51.343
but baby, I'm all about the ropes.

01:04:51.471 --> 01:04:54.133
I'm the Spiderman of Cock Town.

01:04:54.265 --> 01:04:56.381
Or the Tarzan of Cum Jungle.

01:04:57.519 --> 01:04:59.260
<i>Oh.</i>

01:05:06.236 --> 01:05:09.024
You're so much more
than a hot, wet pussy.

01:05:10.657 --> 01:05:12.398
You could be my forever love.

01:05:13.201 --> 01:05:15.568
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:05:15.703 --> 01:05:18.286
You're a hootie-tootie disco cutie.

01:05:18.415 --> 01:05:21.498
I'm a hootie-tootie disco cutie.

01:05:21.626 --> 01:05:23.867
(Both) Hootie-tootie disco cutie.

01:05:24.003 --> 01:05:26.415
Hootie-tootie disco cutie.

01:05:26.548 --> 01:05:28.835
Hootie-tootie
disco cutie!

01:05:28.967 --> 01:05:30.958
(Growling)

01:05:37.183 --> 01:05:39.140
Hootie-tootie disco cutie.

01:05:39.269 --> 01:05:41.010
Hootie-tootie
disco cutie.

01:05:41.146 --> 01:05:42.853
Hootie-tootie disco cutie.

01:05:42.981 --> 01:05:44.813
Hootie-tootie
disco cutie.

01:05:44.941 --> 01:05:46.648
(Growling)

01:05:48.903 --> 01:05:50.769
Hootie-tootie disco cutie.

01:05:50.905 --> 01:05:52.612
Hootie-tootie
disco cutie.

01:05:52.740 --> 01:05:54.902
(Growling)

01:05:56.703 --> 01:05:58.444
Hootie-tootie disco cutie.

01:05:58.580 --> 01:06:00.537
Hootie-tootie
disco cutie.

01:06:00.665 --> 01:06:04.499
Hootie-tootie disco cutie.
Hootie-tootie disco cutie.

01:06:04.627 --> 01:06:06.288
Hootie-tootie
disco cutie.

01:06:06.421 --> 01:06:08.287
Hootie-tootie disco cutie.

01:06:08.423 --> 01:06:10.755
- Hootie-tootie disco cutie.
- Dad, please.

01:06:10.884 --> 01:06:14.127
Hootie-tootie disco cutie.
Hootie-tootie disco cutie.

01:06:14.262 --> 01:06:16.219
Hootie-tootie
disco cutie.

01:06:16.347 --> 01:06:19.931
- Hootie-tootie disco cutie.
- Janet, no, not your ass.

01:06:20.059 --> 01:06:21.845
Hootie-tootie disco cutie.

01:06:21.978 --> 01:06:23.810
Hootie-tootie
disco cutie.

01:06:23.938 --> 01:06:25.520
Hootie-tootie disco cutie.

01:06:36.951 --> 01:06:38.362
(Screams)

01:07:43.518 --> 01:07:45.225
(TV on)

01:07:50.817 --> 01:07:52.023
(Doorbell rings)

01:07:54.362 --> 01:07:55.944
My girlie is here.

01:07:58.074 --> 01:08:00.315
'Nick Lock shot the Fiesta
in the neck.

01:08:00.451 --> 01:08:04.490
'The Rasta went flying through the wall
and was dead instantly.

01:08:04.622 --> 01:08:08.286
'Nick spun the gun around his finger
and pointed it into the future

01:08:08.418 --> 01:08:11.376
'till the Rasta came back to life.

01:08:11.504 --> 01:08:15.748
"'You're under arrest, mon,
for conspiracy to commit revenge,"

01:08:15.883 --> 01:08:18.090
'the Rasta said as he lit
a hand-rolled cigar

01:08:18.219 --> 01:08:19.835
'in the scarlet sunset.'

01:08:22.390 --> 01:08:24.131
Oh, hey, Janet.

01:08:41.908 --> 01:08:43.319
Ah.

01:08:43.453 --> 01:08:45.363
You're up late.

01:08:45.496 --> 01:08:47.487
Yeah, I'm working on a novel.

01:08:49.459 --> 01:08:51.200
The fantasy one?

01:08:51.336 --> 01:08:55.455
No, it's an urban cyber thriller
called "Revenge incorporated".

01:08:56.591 --> 01:08:59.925
It's set in a dark future
where revenge is outlawed

01:09:00.053 --> 01:09:03.421
but there's a company you can hire
to get revenge for you.

01:09:09.812 --> 01:09:13.680
I've been dreaming about you
throughout these long, hard nights.

01:09:16.234 --> 01:09:17.566
Do you miss me?

01:09:21.658 --> 01:09:24.491
Yeah, I sort of miss you.

01:09:25.495 --> 01:09:28.112
I'm lost and lonely for you.

01:09:28.247 --> 01:09:29.908
Basically, I love you.

01:09:34.337 --> 01:09:36.419
Don't say that.

01:09:36.546 --> 01:09:38.913
Unless you mean it, of course.

01:09:39.050 --> 01:09:40.666
Why is the sky blue?

01:09:42.636 --> 01:09:44.969
Because blue is your favourite colour.

01:09:46.808 --> 01:09:48.799
Oh, you cornball.

01:09:48.935 --> 01:09:51.893
Yeah, I'm a cornball, remember?

01:09:52.020 --> 01:09:54.558
I love you, though.
I love you.

01:09:54.691 --> 01:09:56.602
I've wanted to say it for so long.

01:09:58.444 --> 01:10:00.185
It feels good to hear it,

01:10:01.155 --> 01:10:03.396
if I'm honest.

01:10:03.533 --> 01:10:05.695
Give yourself to me for all time.

01:10:08.287 --> 01:10:09.527
Don't say that.

01:10:10.540 --> 01:10:12.281
This girl's confused.

01:10:13.459 --> 01:10:16.042
If I could write your name
on the moon, I would,

01:10:16.170 --> 01:10:17.535
with my own blood.

01:10:18.756 --> 01:10:20.622
And also, I wanna marry you.

01:10:21.592 --> 01:10:23.424
OK.

01:10:23.553 --> 01:10:27.296
I loved you from the moment
I saw you on the disco tour.

01:10:27.432 --> 01:10:29.173
I'm a romantic at heart.

01:10:34.814 --> 01:10:35.804
(Janet) Ronnie?

01:10:37.984 --> 01:10:39.440
Ronnie, are you there?

01:11:20.568 --> 01:11:23.435
Now, that definitely sounds
like Big Ronnie.

01:11:23.571 --> 01:11:26.063
Big Ronnie, is that you?

01:11:26.199 --> 01:11:30.909
Big Ronnie, are you in my car wash?
How's the scrub working out?

01:11:31.704 --> 01:11:33.991
Are the brushes stiff enough for you?

01:11:38.002 --> 01:11:40.619
Take me disco-dancing, Big Ronnie.

01:12:27.802 --> 01:12:29.509
(Phone ringing)

01:12:34.934 --> 01:12:35.924
(Man) 'Hello?'

01:12:36.060 --> 01:12:38.392
I'm calling because I think
it just might be possible

01:12:38.521 --> 01:12:41.604
my dad Ronnie
is the Greasy Strangler.

01:12:41.732 --> 01:12:42.938
'Tomorrow.'

01:12:43.067 --> 01:12:45.354
Tomorrow is fine.
We can meet tomorrow.

01:12:45.486 --> 01:12:47.602
_ 'Bye_bye.l
<i>'</i> BYE-bye.

01:12:49.740 --> 01:12:53.074
A detective is coming tomorrow.
His name is Jody.

01:13:30.323 --> 01:13:33.236
I am Jody,

01:13:34.493 --> 01:13:37.326
and if your hunch is correct,

01:13:37.455 --> 01:13:39.492
you are the son

01:13:39.624 --> 01:13:42.286
of the Greasy Strangler.

01:13:44.503 --> 01:13:47.086
Come on in, Jody.
I like your jacket.

01:14:03.022 --> 01:14:04.729
You see this oil, Jody?

01:14:05.942 --> 01:14:08.525
Looks like the oil
from the murder crime scene.

01:14:09.612 --> 01:14:11.148
I can verify that.

01:14:33.761 --> 01:14:36.970
This oil is scrumptious

01:14:37.098 --> 01:14:39.931
and very good for the skin.

01:14:40.768 --> 01:14:43.305
But that's evidence
against the Greasy Strangler.

01:14:46.232 --> 01:14:47.848
Did you know?

01:14:48.943 --> 01:14:52.527
Jody needs to oil his glasses.

01:15:00.204 --> 01:15:04.414
Now, we shall go downstairs
and discuss the case.

01:15:06.293 --> 01:15:07.909
But first,

01:15:08.045 --> 01:15:11.254
Jody needs to wash his face.

01:15:33.446 --> 01:15:37.656
Your dada may well be
the Greasy Strangler.

01:15:39.910 --> 01:15:45.076
Unfortunately, I cannot proceed
with this case any further

01:15:46.167 --> 01:15:49.034
as there is no evidence.

01:15:50.046 --> 01:15:54.882
Please end all enquiries here.

01:15:57.136 --> 01:15:59.503
What about the oil on his floor?

01:16:01.640 --> 01:16:05.884
Circumstantial evidence is meaningless.

01:16:08.439 --> 01:16:14.606
Please end all enquiries here.

01:16:16.238 --> 01:16:17.774
So we're on our own?

01:16:22.787 --> 01:16:29.750
Please end all enquiries here.

01:16:32.546 --> 01:16:34.708
Come on, Jody, please.

01:16:36.008 --> 01:16:38.841
Please end all...

01:16:41.222 --> 01:16:44.135
Enquiries here.

01:16:44.266 --> 01:16:45.552
Correct.

01:16:47.645 --> 01:16:54.108
Please end all enquiries here.

01:16:56.987 --> 01:16:57.977
Great.

01:16:59.115 --> 01:17:01.402
Well, you've been most helpful, Mr Jody.

01:17:03.035 --> 01:17:05.447
I know my dad's the Greasy Strangler.

01:17:05.579 --> 01:17:08.071
I guess I'll have
to expose him on my own.

01:17:11.085 --> 01:17:12.416
Not on your own.

01:17:24.723 --> 01:17:27.511
Jody needs to go now.

01:17:57.173 --> 01:17:58.789
I'm really glad I met you, Brayden.

01:18:00.342 --> 01:18:03.460
That relationship with Rico
left me in a real bad space.

01:18:04.471 --> 01:18:05.961
Like, the worst.

01:18:07.349 --> 01:18:09.090
That sounds horrible.

01:18:10.644 --> 01:18:12.351
Brayden, can I tell you something?

01:18:14.481 --> 01:18:16.222
Is it about Rico?

01:18:16.358 --> 01:18:17.348
<i>No.</i>

01:18:18.152 --> 01:18:19.563
It's about love.

01:18:20.738 --> 01:18:22.228
I love you.

01:18:23.824 --> 01:18:27.067
(Brayden) Holy shit.
Will you marry me?

01:18:27.203 --> 01:18:28.659
(Janet) Yes, I will, mister.

01:18:35.628 --> 01:18:36.834
Dad!

01:18:36.962 --> 01:18:38.748
- Were you here the whole time?
- Yes.

01:18:38.881 --> 01:18:40.622
Don't hide under Brayden's bed.

01:18:40.758 --> 01:18:42.715
Hey, you're my girlfriend.

01:18:42.843 --> 01:18:45.505
And by the way,
he wouldn't even exist

01:18:45.638 --> 01:18:49.597
if he hadn't flown
out of my long, juicy prickus.

01:18:49.725 --> 01:18:51.056
And as for you,

01:18:51.185 --> 01:18:53.893
as your father
I forbid you to marry.

01:18:54.021 --> 01:18:56.353
And one other thing,
you're evicted,

01:18:56.482 --> 01:18:59.099
so it's time for you to fuck off.

01:18:59.235 --> 01:19:01.727
We're leaving right now
and we're leaving gladly.

01:19:01.862 --> 01:19:04.729
Brayden will move into my place.
He'll be happier there.

01:19:04.865 --> 01:19:07.948
He can twaddle my twat
any time that he wants.

01:19:08.077 --> 01:19:11.695
And, I don't care if he craps on the bed.
I'll rub it on my tits.

01:19:11.830 --> 01:19:13.787
Yeah, Dad, we don't need you.

01:19:13.916 --> 01:19:16.157
And it kills you to think
that Janet loves me.

01:19:16.293 --> 01:19:18.159
But guess what? I love her.

01:19:18.295 --> 01:19:20.753
And you were right
about one thing, though, Dad.

01:19:20.881 --> 01:19:23.043
She is a hootie-tootie disco cutie.

01:19:23.175 --> 01:19:24.961
Hootie-tootie disco cutie.

01:19:25.094 --> 01:19:27.005
Hootie-tootie
disco cutie.

01:19:27.137 --> 01:19:30.380
Hootie-tootie disco cutie.
Hootie-tootie disco cutie.

01:19:30.516 --> 01:19:32.678
Hootie-tootie disco cutie.

01:19:32.810 --> 01:19:34.471
Hootie-tootie
disco cutie.

01:19:34.603 --> 01:19:36.469
Hootie-tootie disco cutie.

01:19:38.023 --> 01:19:39.605
(Growling)

01:19:41.026 --> 01:19:42.812
Just so you know,

01:19:42.945 --> 01:19:46.233
he tried to impress me
with a loud fart once.

01:19:46.365 --> 01:19:48.402
He put his legs behind his head
and shouted,

01:19:48.534 --> 01:19:50.571
"Someone's cutting the cheese."

01:19:50.703 --> 01:19:55.789
Instead of just gas, a big glob of turd
flew out of his butt like a rocket.

01:19:55.916 --> 01:19:59.454
It did a loop-the-loop near the wall
and landed on the bed.

01:19:59.586 --> 01:20:02.453
So if anyone's a bed crapper
around here, it's him.

01:20:03.132 --> 01:20:05.874
- That must have been tough.
- Yeah.

01:20:06.010 --> 01:20:08.092
It looked like a big, brown finger.

01:20:08.220 --> 01:20:09.881
It was pointing right at me.

01:20:10.514 --> 01:20:12.972
If he really is the Greasy Strangler,

01:20:13.100 --> 01:20:14.511
you have to kill him.

01:21:03.609 --> 01:21:06.226
I can get greasy too.

01:21:06.362 --> 01:21:09.525
I can be a Greasy Strangler too.

01:21:09.656 --> 01:21:12.523
You're not the only Greasy Strangler.

01:21:13.077 --> 01:21:16.490
I'm the Greasy Strangler too.

01:21:51.240 --> 01:21:53.732
(Gasping)

01:22:54.928 --> 01:22:56.339
You're all right, Brayden.

01:22:58.056 --> 01:22:59.421
Thanks, Dad.

01:22:59.558 --> 01:23:01.925
That means a lot,
coming from you.

01:23:04.229 --> 01:23:07.017
We never really got along,
though, did we?

01:23:07.149 --> 01:23:08.139
Yeah.

01:23:09.109 --> 01:23:11.726
By which I mean, nah.

01:23:13.530 --> 01:23:15.897
It wasn't always like that.

01:23:16.033 --> 01:23:19.321
You were a cute baby.
I used to love cradling you.

01:23:20.579 --> 01:23:23.412
You cheesy old cornball.

01:23:23.540 --> 01:23:27.955
Well...you were a baby,
a tiny baby.

01:23:39.014 --> 01:23:42.006
You probably won't remember this,
but when you were small,

01:23:42.142 --> 01:23:45.931
we stayed on John Travolta's
luxury yacht in the Caribbean.

01:23:46.063 --> 01:23:49.897
We sailed around the islands
from Port-au-Prince to Montego Bay.

01:23:50.859 --> 01:23:53.851
Wow, I really don't remember that.

01:23:53.987 --> 01:23:55.443
You called it.

01:23:55.572 --> 01:23:58.234
Yeah, and John said
you were a good kid

01:23:58.367 --> 01:24:00.199
and you had good energy.

01:24:01.328 --> 01:24:02.659
OK.

01:24:02.788 --> 01:24:05.701
John Travolta talking about Brayden.

01:24:05.832 --> 01:24:08.620
I'm kind of trying to process that.

01:24:08.752 --> 01:24:11.870
Me and John were busting our butts
on a big business deal.

01:24:13.340 --> 01:24:15.081
That's kind of amazing, Dad.

01:24:15.634 --> 01:24:18.092
Yeah, he offered me a chance
to move to New Orleans

01:24:18.220 --> 01:24:23.340
to open a big disco
with very expensive drinks,

01:24:23.475 --> 01:24:25.136
a billiards room,

01:24:25.269 --> 01:24:28.102
a cherry-coloured, funky dance floor.

01:24:28.230 --> 01:24:32.064
There was going to be a pink limo
to cruise the Big Easy

01:24:32.192 --> 01:24:34.900
and pick up those hot
dancing mamasitas.

01:24:36.029 --> 01:24:39.021
It was gonna be called
"John and Ron's Dance Jungle".

01:24:40.659 --> 01:24:43.071
But you were small.

01:24:43.203 --> 01:24:46.491
I really didn't wanna leave you
with Mum and Ricky Prickles.

01:24:48.709 --> 01:24:51.076
Are you glad I moved in with you?

01:24:52.838 --> 01:24:57.753
Hey, I'd rather be here with you
than in New Orleans with John Travolta.

01:25:01.054 --> 01:25:03.421
But you really annoyed me.

01:25:03.557 --> 01:25:07.846
Your food was dry, and you made it
really hard to score ass.

01:25:09.021 --> 01:25:10.728
Look, I'm being honest here.

01:25:11.690 --> 01:25:13.681
Fair enough, I reckon, mate.

01:25:14.776 --> 01:25:18.394
That's probably why I screwed
your girlfriend up the butthole.

01:25:20.115 --> 01:25:21.947
I reckon, mate.

01:25:24.244 --> 01:25:27.362
She was disgusting, wasn't she?

01:25:28.165 --> 01:25:29.155
Yeah.

01:25:30.417 --> 01:25:32.033
She was gross.

01:25:32.878 --> 01:25:35.495
Gotta say,
she was kind of gross.

01:25:35.631 --> 01:25:38.419
Her pussy hair was like dried grass.

01:25:39.843 --> 01:25:43.336
Yeah, like the kind you see
on those African wildlife shows,

01:25:43.472 --> 01:25:45.804
sort of all dry and orangey.

01:25:47.142 --> 01:25:48.177
(Laughing)

01:25:52.939 --> 01:25:55.101
She faked all her orgasms with me.

01:25:55.233 --> 01:25:57.315
She definitely did with you.

01:25:58.654 --> 01:25:59.985
We don't need her.

01:26:19.508 --> 01:26:21.920
Let's kill Ricky Prickles.

01:26:25.389 --> 01:26:28.222
(Both) Let's kill Ricky Prickles.

01:26:28.350 --> 01:26:30.967
Let's kill Ricky Prickles.

01:26:31.103 --> 01:26:34.346
Let's kill
Ricky Prickles!

01:26:34.481 --> 01:26:36.472
(Laughing)

01:26:59.005 --> 01:27:01.212
Fuck you, guys!

01:27:01.341 --> 01:27:04.333
I am professional sprinter!

01:27:04.469 --> 01:27:06.676
I am Ricky Prickles!

01:27:06.805 --> 01:27:08.762
You'll never catch me!

01:27:08.890 --> 01:27:10.005
Oh, fuck.

01:27:10.142 --> 01:27:12.099
(Screaming)

01:29:07.592 --> 01:29:09.048
(Snarling)

01:29:09.177 --> 01:29:10.508
(Groaning)

01:29:16.643 --> 01:29:17.849
(Scream)
