00:09.487 --> 00:11.011
<i>with taking</i>
<i>your blood pressure.</i>

00:11.054 --> 00:12.186
What are you doing
back there?

00:12.229 --> 00:14.014
<i>It's a vital indicator</i>
<i>of your health.</i>

00:14.057 --> 00:15.711
Ahh!

00:15.754 --> 00:17.713
Oh, baby girl.

00:17.756 --> 00:19.541
I know
all the tricks.

00:19.584 --> 00:20.803
I've done this before.

00:20.846 --> 00:22.326
<i>But within the human body,</i>

00:22.370 --> 00:24.589
<i>there are many</i>
<i>pressurized systems,</i>

00:24.633 --> 00:27.070
<i>and each has its own threshold</i>
<i>and consequence for pressure.</i>

00:27.114 --> 00:28.724
You're late.

00:28.767 --> 00:31.161
Yeah, well, B-shift
was late first.

00:31.205 --> 00:32.989
Mm-hmm.

00:33.033 --> 00:34.251
How are
my favorite ladies?

00:34.295 --> 00:36.297
Oh, well, one of us
slept through the night.

00:36.340 --> 00:37.559
- Yay!
- Yay!

00:37.602 --> 00:39.952
And the other one
was jolted out of bed

00:39.996 --> 00:41.737
with a hospital scheduling
nightmare.

00:41.780 --> 00:43.956
Make the residents
pick up the slack.

00:44.000 --> 00:45.219
Minnesota's got
a good program.

00:45.262 --> 00:46.524
Maybe you can poach one
from there.

00:46.568 --> 00:48.091
Too soon?

00:48.135 --> 00:51.094
Dr. Wright
has apologized, twice,

00:51.138 --> 00:52.965
and he hasn't been
on my service since.

00:53.749 --> 00:55.185
Since when?

00:55.229 --> 00:56.708
Oh. Oh, since
he planted one on you. Oh.

00:56.752 --> 00:58.667
The coffee's fresh.

00:58.710 --> 01:01.148
Uh, don't let Miss Pru
con you out of her nap.

01:01.191 --> 01:02.540
Oh, you know
what we should do?

01:02.584 --> 01:04.064
We should bring her
lunch today.
Oh!

01:04.107 --> 01:06.370
I could wear my turnouts
and my helmet

01:06.414 --> 01:08.416
and my big,
red fireman badge,

01:08.459 --> 01:10.331
and I could strut around
in front of Dr. Romeo

01:10.374 --> 01:12.420
a few times.

01:12.463 --> 01:15.118
Love you! <i> Too much pressure on the lungs</i>

01:15.162 --> 01:18.208
<i>can cause them to collapse</i>
<i>to 1/10 of their size.</i>

01:18.252 --> 01:19.949
<i>Skulls can only take</i>
<i>so much pressure</i>

01:19.992 --> 01:22.212
<i>before the brain herniates</i>
<i>into the spinal cord.</i>

01:22.256 --> 01:25.911
My case notes, my bag,
my coffee, my keys --

01:27.217 --> 01:29.567
No. No.
Not my keys.

01:29.611 --> 01:31.395
Have you seen my keys?

01:31.439 --> 01:34.790
They were just -- just --

01:34.833 --> 01:36.008
Ah!

01:36.052 --> 01:37.009
Keys.

01:37.053 --> 01:38.924
Okay, we're ready.

01:38.968 --> 01:41.405
Exhausted,
but we are ready.

01:41.449 --> 01:42.928
Are you ready?

01:44.234 --> 01:46.106
Oh. You found Ribbit.

01:46.149 --> 01:47.542
Okay, this is Scout's.

01:47.585 --> 01:50.632
We -- We have to
give him back.

01:50.675 --> 01:52.808
Okay. Here.

01:54.418 --> 01:55.376
Don't look at me
like that.

01:55.419 --> 01:57.552
I miss them, too.

01:57.595 --> 01:59.249
<i>Enough pressure on the limbs</i>
<i>can cut off blood flow</i>

01:59.293 --> 02:01.686
<i>and kill them.</i> Okay.

02:03.427 --> 02:05.516
<i>The person you are trying</i>
<i>to reach is unavailable.</i>

02:05.560 --> 02:06.996
<i>Please leave a message.</i>

02:07.039 --> 02:10.304
Schmitt?
It's Dr. Webber again.

02:10.347 --> 02:12.088
Call me back, please.

02:13.829 --> 02:16.571
Are you
still calling that boy?

02:16.614 --> 02:18.268
Every morning,

02:18.312 --> 02:21.576
and I will until he answers
or comes back to work.

02:23.012 --> 02:25.101
You think I should
give up on him?

02:25.145 --> 02:29.888
I think not everyone belongs
in an OR, baby.

02:31.847 --> 02:34.719
<i>The amount of pressure</i>
<i>may vary,</i>

02:34.763 --> 02:37.069
<i>but every system</i>
<i>has a breaking point.</i>

02:38.723 --> 02:40.334
Ten more seconds.

02:40.377 --> 02:42.074
Oh, man.

02:42.118 --> 02:43.598
If I can do it,
then you can do it.

02:43.641 --> 02:45.165
Yeah, you're 14.
You're a rubber band.

02:46.818 --> 02:50.561
Look, I couldn't even bend
at all after surgery.

02:50.605 --> 02:51.867
But now look.

02:51.910 --> 02:53.608
That's why you can't slack
on physical therapy.

02:53.651 --> 02:55.871
I'm not.
I got two broken bones, okay?

02:55.914 --> 02:57.089
In the same leg.

02:57.133 --> 02:58.569
And a spine injury!

02:58.613 --> 02:59.657
He had
open-heart surgery.

02:59.701 --> 03:00.876
Is this a competition?

03:00.919 --> 03:02.312
Absolutely.

03:02.356 --> 03:03.531
Always.

03:04.662 --> 03:07.491
Okay, it is complete.

03:08.927 --> 03:12.235
Your dining room
is now your gym.

03:12.279 --> 03:13.628
Time for weight-bearing
exercises

03:13.671 --> 03:15.195
so we can get you
walking again.

03:15.238 --> 03:18.328
Alright, I've got to
pack the car.

03:18.372 --> 03:20.025
Up you go.
20 leg raises.

03:20.069 --> 03:21.157
I did those an hour ago.

03:21.201 --> 03:22.158
Congratulations.

03:22.202 --> 03:23.159
20 more.

03:23.203 --> 03:25.509
Oh, God.

03:27.424 --> 03:29.383
Post-op assessments
continue to show

03:29.426 --> 03:31.602
no signs of cerebral edema
or midline shift

03:31.646 --> 03:33.256
post cell injection,

03:33.300 --> 03:35.606
and there is no regression
in motor deficits.

03:35.650 --> 03:37.173
"Regression"?

03:37.217 --> 03:38.870
My motor skills
have improved,

03:38.914 --> 03:40.655
but Dr. Grey can't say that
definitively,

03:40.698 --> 03:43.266
because the medical journals
don't like that.

03:43.310 --> 03:46.269
But last night,
it was unbelievable.

03:46.313 --> 03:47.270
My wife and I --

03:47.314 --> 03:49.141
Let's --
Let's stop there.

03:49.185 --> 03:51.796
Oh, get your mind out
of the gutter, Dr. Bartley.

03:51.840 --> 03:53.363
We played chess.

03:54.886 --> 03:57.062
- And my hand didn't shake.
- Hm.

03:57.106 --> 03:58.412
Thanks to Dr. Grey.

03:58.455 --> 03:59.326
Thanks to the whole team.

03:59.369 --> 04:01.284
Led by you.

04:01.328 --> 04:03.243
Just accept
the compliment.

04:03.286 --> 04:05.114
And on behalf
of the clinic's leadership,

04:05.157 --> 04:07.072
we hope you will also accept
our offer

04:07.116 --> 04:10.554
for you to join us here
in a permanent position,

04:10.598 --> 04:15.080
as director of the Grey Center
and chief of general surgery.

04:15.124 --> 04:16.517
When can you start?

04:29.312 --> 04:30.313
- Nonfat latte.
- Thank you.

04:30.357 --> 04:32.315
Hey.
I just got in.

04:32.359 --> 04:34.404
My flight got delayed
a couple times.

04:34.448 --> 04:36.406
Noted.

04:36.450 --> 04:40.062
Did you see my e-mail about
the preschool sites for Scout?

04:40.105 --> 04:42.717
Yeah, uh, I still haven't
looked at it, but I will.

04:42.760 --> 04:45.154
Yeah, we should probably get him
on some waiting lists.

04:45.197 --> 04:47.330
There's one school
with a nature program.

04:47.374 --> 04:48.897
They grow
their own snacks.

04:48.940 --> 04:50.768
There's another one
with a music program.

04:50.812 --> 04:52.640
Yeah, well,
I said I'd look at them.

04:52.683 --> 04:53.728
I know.
I just want to get --

04:53.771 --> 04:55.338
I have a patient waiting.

04:55.382 --> 04:57.645
<i>Dr. Bradford</i>
<i>to Labor and Delivery.</i>

04:57.688 --> 04:59.299
<i>Dr. Bradford</i>
<i>to Labor and Delivery.</i>

05:00.691 --> 05:01.866
Well, it looks like
it's appendicitis.

05:01.910 --> 05:03.868
So tell the resident
to take him up to CT.

05:03.912 --> 05:05.130
Wait, do I have
a resident?

05:05.174 --> 05:06.741
Here.
I'm here. Sorry.

05:06.784 --> 05:08.351
J--
You've already apologized.

05:08.395 --> 05:10.048
No need to keep raising
the incident.

05:10.092 --> 05:11.223
No, I-I meant --
I meant for being late.

05:11.267 --> 05:13.965
I'm on your service.

05:14.009 --> 05:14.879
But if you need me
to be somewhere else,

05:14.923 --> 05:16.533
I will absolutely go.
Um...

05:16.577 --> 05:18.318
Find another resident.

05:18.361 --> 05:19.493
Get a chart.

05:19.536 --> 05:21.799
Help, help!
I-I need help!

05:21.843 --> 05:22.800
Are you doctors?

05:22.844 --> 05:24.149
Uh, yeah.
Y-- Are you hurt?

05:24.193 --> 05:25.716
Uh, not me.
My boyfriend.

05:25.760 --> 05:27.544
He's in the car with Gigi,
and he needs help.

05:27.588 --> 05:29.024
Hurry, please!

05:29.067 --> 05:31.374
I warned him something like this
would happen.

05:31.418 --> 05:33.420
I knew letting Gigi live with us
was a bad idea.

05:33.463 --> 05:36.074
Oh, is Gigi hurt, too?
Is she a family member?

05:36.118 --> 05:37.554
Ivan treats her like one.

05:37.598 --> 05:39.339
Honey, I brought doctors.
Everything's gonna be okay.

05:41.428 --> 05:42.864
Oh!
Hi.

05:42.907 --> 05:44.126
Is that
a boa constrictor?!

05:44.169 --> 05:45.519
Burmese python.

05:45.562 --> 05:46.520
Gigi.

05:46.563 --> 05:48.696
Give us one minute.

05:51.133 --> 05:52.134
Everything's
gonna be okay, okay?

05:52.177 --> 05:53.440
Just look at me.

05:53.483 --> 05:55.485
Just breathe, okay?
It's gonna be fine.

06:07.192 --> 06:09.673
You had to know
- an offer was coming.
- Why? Did you?

06:09.717 --> 06:11.458
No, but your project
was wildly successful.

06:11.501 --> 06:14.417
Doesn't take a genius to
figure out we'd want you here.

06:14.461 --> 06:16.419
We're really not even done
with the Parkinson's research.

06:16.463 --> 06:17.899
It doesn't matter.

06:17.942 --> 06:19.509
Now they all want to see
what else you can do.

06:22.077 --> 06:23.774
What if I just want to go home
and be with my kids?

06:23.818 --> 06:24.993
Then you should.

06:25.036 --> 06:27.343
You don't have to do
every project yourself.

06:27.387 --> 06:29.737
Hire a great team,
provide strategic direction.

06:29.780 --> 06:31.434
It's still your name
on the door.

06:31.478 --> 06:32.957
Look out.

06:35.090 --> 06:36.526
What could have possibly made
you think

06:36.570 --> 06:38.920
that I would respond well
to you springing this on me

06:38.963 --> 06:40.835
in front of a staff
I do not know?

06:40.878 --> 06:43.620
Well, maybe
you'll respond well to this.

06:43.664 --> 06:45.709
It's the hospital's new budget
on the Grey Center

06:45.753 --> 06:47.450
and your prospective
salary.

06:47.494 --> 06:50.453
I'm sorry you felt ambushed
back there.

06:50.497 --> 06:53.413
This just got approved this
morning, and I got excited.

06:53.456 --> 06:55.589
You pick
what we do with it.

06:55.632 --> 06:57.286
Take the work that we've done
and run with it.

06:57.329 --> 06:59.549
Huntington's disease,
ALS, MS, Alzheimer's --

06:59.593 --> 07:01.595
whatever you want.

07:01.638 --> 07:03.814
And I think Dr. Marsh
might benefit, too.

07:05.033 --> 07:08.384
So, win-win, right?

07:10.299 --> 07:12.693
Okay.

07:16.261 --> 07:18.916
<i>Dr. Norico Ohn to Radiology.</i>

07:18.960 --> 07:21.571
Did Bailey say why
she needed to see me outside?

07:21.615 --> 07:22.877
Patient consult.

07:22.920 --> 07:25.096
Well, we typically
see those inside, Helm.

07:25.140 --> 07:27.490
Dr. Perez said Dr. Wright said
Dr. Bailey said --

07:27.534 --> 07:29.449
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
N-Never mind, okay?

07:34.758 --> 07:36.151
Excuse me.

07:39.415 --> 07:42.070
Oh!

07:42.113 --> 07:44.289
Now it makes sense.

07:44.333 --> 07:45.900
N-No.

07:45.943 --> 07:48.598
N-No, no, no.

07:48.642 --> 07:50.470
Mnh-mnh.
Nope. Mnh-mnh.

07:50.513 --> 07:51.993
32-year-old male,

07:52.036 --> 07:53.864
bite to
the upper left arm,

07:53.908 --> 07:55.300
constricting injury,

07:55.344 --> 07:58.347
complains of pain
to the arm, chest, and abdomen.

07:58.390 --> 07:59.957
I had questionable pineapple
this morning,

08:00.001 --> 08:01.263
so it could be that.

08:01.306 --> 08:02.569
I'm guessing not.

08:02.612 --> 08:04.222
When are you people gonna
get her off of him?!

08:04.266 --> 08:07.225
Hon, you know I love it when you
get fired up, but I'm okay.

08:07.269 --> 08:08.444
Gigi's just giving me
a hug.

08:08.488 --> 08:10.141
Gigi is killing you!

08:10.185 --> 08:12.448
Burmese pythons
are docile.

08:12.492 --> 08:15.277
Uh. Your situation
suggests otherwise.

08:15.320 --> 08:18.367
I teach second grade, and
my class is studying reptiles,

08:18.410 --> 08:22.197
so I thought a class pet
would be engaging.

08:22.240 --> 08:25.113
I swear, when I got her,
she was only a few feet,

08:25.156 --> 08:27.071
but she just kept
- growing and growing.
- Mnh-mnh.

08:27.115 --> 08:28.464
So I brought her home.

08:28.508 --> 08:29.944
And she grew
because you fed her too much.

08:29.987 --> 08:32.990
I swear,
she's never done this before.

08:33.034 --> 08:34.165
When I went to feed her
this morning,

08:34.209 --> 08:36.516
she bit my arm
instead of her food.

08:36.559 --> 08:38.300
Once they bite,
they don't let go.

08:38.343 --> 08:40.563
Ohhh! Ohh.

08:40.607 --> 08:42.478
I can't feel my hand.

08:42.522 --> 08:44.132
Is that bad?

08:44.175 --> 08:45.655
Yes!

08:45.699 --> 08:47.788
He has eyes on the back
of his head with his students,

08:47.831 --> 08:49.703
but Gigi's just
one slithering blind spot.

08:49.746 --> 08:51.269
O2 is dropping.

08:51.313 --> 08:53.750
Look, uh, page Neuro
and Cardio a-and Ortho.

08:53.794 --> 08:54.925
No, page everyone.

08:54.969 --> 08:56.361
Until we get that thing
off of him,

08:56.405 --> 08:57.624
we don't know
what's going on.

08:57.667 --> 09:00.365
And where's
Animal Control?
Oh, God.

09:02.629 --> 09:03.891
Hey.

09:03.934 --> 09:05.632
Uh, Luna found Ribbit
this morning.

09:05.675 --> 09:06.763
I put him with your stuff
in the lounge.

09:06.807 --> 09:08.896
Oh. I was wondering
where that went.

09:08.939 --> 09:11.246
Are you looking
at preschools?

09:11.289 --> 09:13.640
Amelia says we need
to put him on a wait list.

09:13.683 --> 09:14.902
Do you already have a plan
for Luna?

09:14.945 --> 09:16.686
Yeah, I'm just gonna see
what you do

09:16.730 --> 09:18.688
and then just do that.

09:20.995 --> 09:23.040
Ortho consult
needed outside?

09:24.346 --> 09:26.827
Um...we miss you.

09:26.870 --> 09:29.569
Well, we miss you, too.

09:29.612 --> 09:31.222
<i>Dr. Brooks to Oncology.</i>

09:31.266 --> 09:32.659
<i>Dr. Brooks to Oncology.</i>

09:32.702 --> 09:34.051
For the record...

09:35.487 --> 09:37.011
...I blame Amelia.

09:37.054 --> 09:39.100
How is what happened between us

09:39.143 --> 09:41.581
- Amelia's fault?
- Ohh.

09:41.624 --> 09:43.713
Well, because I've decided that
everything is Amelia's fault.

09:43.757 --> 09:45.497
She's found a way to ruin
every good thing in my life.

09:45.541 --> 09:46.847
We are not ruined.

09:46.890 --> 09:48.675
We are best friends

09:48.718 --> 09:51.808
who were smart enough
to protect that.

09:51.852 --> 09:53.593
Okay, fine.

09:53.636 --> 09:54.942
But she's ruined
most good things.

09:54.985 --> 09:57.248
I think I like
petty Link.

09:57.292 --> 09:58.685
Petty?
Mm-hmm.

09:58.728 --> 10:00.556
Yeah, okay,
I'm petty now. Great.

10:00.600 --> 10:02.993
She turned me into my father.
I blame her for that, too.

10:03.037 --> 10:06.606
But your father got back
together with your mother.

10:06.649 --> 10:08.651
You're not helping.

10:13.613 --> 10:15.658
Want me to run another BNP
on Mr. Walters?

10:15.702 --> 10:16.833
Please and thank you.

10:16.877 --> 10:19.314
I am headed
to see my MVR.

10:19.357 --> 10:21.533
Dr. Pierce! We need Cardio
in the ambulance bay.

10:21.577 --> 10:22.883
There's a snake.

10:22.926 --> 10:24.493
Alright.
And that's code for...?

10:24.536 --> 10:26.843
Snake! There's a giant one
wrapped around a dude's body.

10:26.887 --> 10:28.279
Not it!

10:28.323 --> 10:29.454
You don't like snakes?

10:29.498 --> 10:30.891
- No. Do you?
- Oh, I love snakes.

10:30.934 --> 10:32.936
I begged my mom for a pet snake
when I was a kid.

10:32.980 --> 10:34.111
I even considered
herpetology.

10:34.155 --> 10:35.373
That's great.

10:35.417 --> 10:36.766
Yeah.
Yeah.

10:36.810 --> 10:38.420
- Let's go. Yeah.
- I'll be right --
Yeah, yeah.

10:38.463 --> 10:40.117
Who are you?

10:42.163 --> 10:44.078
Hey.
Okay, what do we --

10:44.121 --> 10:46.471
Oh, my God!
- Wow, wow! Wow! Wow!
- Oh! Oh, okay, yeah, no.
I don't --

10:46.515 --> 10:47.995
Everyone here
needs to grow up.

10:49.692 --> 10:50.911
Wright,
get that cannula on him.

10:50.954 --> 10:53.130
Yeah, I-I just don't want
to disturb Gigi.

10:53.174 --> 10:54.436
She's not poisonous,
is she?

10:54.479 --> 10:58.135
No, her species is
very easygoing. Shy, even.

10:58.179 --> 10:59.789
I know you love her,
but she thinks you're food.

10:59.833 --> 11:01.704
How are we supposed to
examine him?

11:01.748 --> 11:02.836
By chopping her head off!

11:02.879 --> 11:04.968
No!
Oh...

11:05.012 --> 11:06.709
Awesome.

11:06.753 --> 11:09.277
A python.

11:09.320 --> 11:11.453
You know they can swallow
their prey whole?

11:11.496 --> 11:12.759
Well, imagine that.

11:12.802 --> 11:15.065
Uh, sir, just try to relax.
Okay? Alright?

11:15.109 --> 11:17.633
Every time you breathe, your
snake is programmed to tighten.

11:17.677 --> 11:19.853
But we're gonna
get her off you, okay?

11:19.896 --> 11:21.811
Alright.
Uh, we need rubbing alcohol.

11:21.855 --> 11:23.030
- Okay.
- Uh, Helm, r--

11:26.381 --> 11:28.775
Helm! Alcohol!

11:30.341 --> 11:31.560
Helm!

11:40.134 --> 11:43.137
- Good morning!
- Hi!

11:43.180 --> 11:44.573
Tseng?

11:44.616 --> 11:47.010
Laura Eames, 34, severe
mitral valve insufficiency

11:47.054 --> 11:48.533
and scheduled
for a mitral repair.

11:48.577 --> 11:50.100
And also
22 weeks pregnant.

11:50.144 --> 11:51.101
How are you feeling?

11:51.145 --> 11:53.234
Oh, I'm good.
Todd's a mess.

11:53.277 --> 11:54.931
She's been breathing
even harder on our walks,

11:54.975 --> 11:56.106
and the swelling in her legs
has gotten worse,

11:56.150 --> 11:57.804
and she's gained
another 2.1 pounds.

11:57.847 --> 11:59.762
He keeps a spreadsheet
of my weight,

11:59.806 --> 12:01.242
as if it'll somehow help.

12:01.285 --> 12:03.679
Find me a woman who wants
a spreadsheet of her weight.

12:03.723 --> 12:05.202
I like data.
I'm a --

12:05.246 --> 12:06.856
Don't say "doctor."

12:06.900 --> 12:09.337
PhD.
Environmental science.

12:09.380 --> 12:10.425
He doesn't save lives.

12:10.468 --> 12:12.427
He can save us
from climate change.

12:12.470 --> 12:15.082
Well, speaking of data,
I need to do your echo

12:15.125 --> 12:16.823
before we take you up
to pre-op.

12:16.866 --> 12:19.390
So we'll need
to lower your gown.

12:19.434 --> 12:20.870
Oh, bye.

12:20.914 --> 12:21.958
Oh, no. Uh. You can --
You can stay with your wife.

12:22.002 --> 12:23.394
- Oh, ew.
- Oh, no.

12:23.438 --> 12:24.482
- No, no, no, no.
- Oh, no,
we're not married.

12:24.526 --> 12:25.483
He's my brother.

12:25.527 --> 12:27.094
Oh! Sorry.

12:27.137 --> 12:29.270
It's okay.
But, really, bye.

12:33.491 --> 12:35.493
I left my fidget popper
for Leo.

12:35.537 --> 12:36.843
I'm gonna miss you.

12:36.886 --> 12:39.671
Yeah, I'm not. He beat me
at gin rummy five times.

12:39.715 --> 12:41.195
And that was just
this morning.

12:41.238 --> 12:43.893
Well, come here. Come here.
I love you.

12:43.937 --> 12:46.983
Owen's PT routine. He needs to
be up on his feet yesterday.

12:47.027 --> 12:49.246
I don't need oversight.

12:49.290 --> 12:50.726
If you ever want
to walk again, you do.

12:50.770 --> 12:52.423
And please,
just let people help.

12:52.467 --> 12:54.208
I mean it.
You can't be the only hero.

12:54.251 --> 12:56.210
Even if you're mine.

12:58.255 --> 12:59.822
Farouk, you want to take that
out to the car?

12:59.866 --> 13:01.563
I'll be right behind you.

13:02.651 --> 13:06.002
I feel another lecture
coming on.

13:06.046 --> 13:08.788
I've given you guys a pass
because you've had a full house,

13:08.831 --> 13:10.702
but now we're leaving,
and your kids are at Mom's,

13:10.746 --> 13:12.487
and so it finally gives you
some alone time

13:12.530 --> 13:14.576
to deal with whatever the hell
is happening between you two.

13:14.619 --> 13:16.099
And don't say
that it's nothing.

13:16.143 --> 13:18.188
You two are easier to read
than Leo's Dr. Seuss books.

13:20.930 --> 13:22.802
Fix it.

13:24.891 --> 13:26.327
Love you!

13:33.900 --> 13:36.380
Alright, a little bit
of rubbing alcohol

13:36.424 --> 13:38.339
sprayed around Gigi's mouth
will irritate her.

13:38.382 --> 13:39.514
When you --
you say "i-irritate"...Well, s-she'll
unclench her jaw.

13:39.557 --> 13:41.037
But it won't hurt her.
She'll be fine.

13:41.081 --> 13:42.473
Yeah, and --
and then what?

13:42.517 --> 13:43.692
Then we have to
uncoil her.

13:43.735 --> 13:45.912
Uh, but she can't do it
by herself, so...

13:45.955 --> 13:49.132
Wright and Lincoln and I
will remove her,

13:49.176 --> 13:51.004
and then
you can all move Ivan inside.

13:51.047 --> 13:52.657
Yeah, I don't remember
volunteering.

13:54.355 --> 13:56.487
Okay, fine.

13:56.531 --> 13:57.532
Fine.
Alright, alright.

13:57.575 --> 13:58.272
You ready, Dr. Webber?

13:58.315 --> 14:00.883
Uh! Um...

14:00.927 --> 14:02.667
Okay.

14:05.453 --> 14:06.671
Okay.

14:13.330 --> 14:14.723
- Oh, for God's sakes.
- Huh?

14:14.766 --> 14:16.551
Let's save this man's life!

14:18.161 --> 14:19.380
Bailey, be careful.

14:26.735 --> 14:27.779
Oh, my God.
It's working.

14:27.823 --> 14:28.868
Ohh!

14:28.911 --> 14:29.956
- Aah! Aah!
- Ohh!

14:29.999 --> 14:31.609
Oh! I got you.
I got you.

14:31.653 --> 14:32.915
Okay, good.
It's time, guys. It's time.

14:32.959 --> 14:34.612
Oh, here we go.
Here we go.

14:34.656 --> 14:35.962
Alright, go, go, go.

14:37.180 --> 14:38.138
There we go.

14:38.181 --> 14:39.269
Oh, God!

14:39.313 --> 14:40.705
Easy, guys.
Easy.

14:40.749 --> 14:41.663
Ooh, don't bite me.
Don't bite me. Don't bite me.

14:41.706 --> 14:43.360
I hate snakes.
I hate snakes.

14:43.404 --> 14:45.449
There we go.
There we go.

14:45.493 --> 14:47.016
Oh, God, oh, God,
oh, God.

14:47.060 --> 14:48.017
Alright,
alright, alright.

14:48.061 --> 14:49.149
Over his head.
Right there.

14:49.192 --> 14:50.150
- Alright. Alright.
- Alright.

14:50.193 --> 14:51.238
Okay. Got him?

14:51.281 --> 14:52.630
- Okay.
- Alright.

14:53.893 --> 14:54.850
Watch his head.

14:54.894 --> 14:56.678
I got you, buddy.

14:58.593 --> 15:00.725
I'm coming.
I'm coming. Ivan.

15:02.423 --> 15:03.728
I'm right here.
I'm right here, okay?

15:03.772 --> 15:05.687
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

15:05.730 --> 15:07.645
I'll be okay.
Take care of Gigi.

15:07.689 --> 15:08.908
Alright, Trauma 1.
Let's go.

15:08.951 --> 15:09.909
Okay, I got it.

15:09.952 --> 15:11.649
Now, Link, now!

15:14.914 --> 15:16.132
Ohh!

15:22.791 --> 15:23.966
Okay, Laura.

15:25.707 --> 15:29.450
Your labs
look reassuring,

15:29.493 --> 15:31.974
and -- and Todd
is grabbing coffee.

15:32.018 --> 15:33.497
He seems pretty worried.

15:33.541 --> 15:35.586
He's the reason
why I'm here.

15:35.630 --> 15:37.545
No. Sorry.
That sounded wrong.

15:38.850 --> 15:41.027
When I decided
to get pregnant,

15:41.070 --> 15:42.463
everybody warned me
against it.

15:42.506 --> 15:44.378
My parents worried
about my heart.

15:44.421 --> 15:47.511
My friends worried about me
raising a kid alone.

15:47.555 --> 15:50.427
Todd immediately
made a spreadsheet.

15:50.471 --> 15:52.952
He's come with her
- to all of her appointments.
- Oh.

15:52.995 --> 15:55.389
He's been letting me stay
at the other half of his duplex

15:55.432 --> 15:57.260
while I recover.

15:57.304 --> 15:59.828
I've always been pretty
independent, but free rent.

15:59.871 --> 16:02.744
Take it.
Babies are expensive,

16:02.787 --> 16:05.355
and good help
is hard to find.

16:05.399 --> 16:06.966
I'm a single mom, too.

16:07.009 --> 16:08.576
How do you do it?
Do you have help?

16:08.619 --> 16:10.230
A significant other?

16:10.273 --> 16:12.754
On your side.
My job has a,
uh, daycare.

16:12.797 --> 16:14.364
Okay. Good.

16:14.408 --> 16:17.237
You know, you seem like
a -- a really kind person.

16:17.280 --> 16:18.760
Oh.

16:18.803 --> 16:22.285
Healthy, well-adjusted,
and you're a doctor.

16:22.329 --> 16:23.895
Are you open to dating?

16:23.939 --> 16:25.549
If -- If the person
liked kids?

16:25.593 --> 16:27.029
Oh...

16:27.073 --> 16:30.119
Well, um,
our hospital policy

16:30.163 --> 16:31.991
prohibits doctors
from dating patients.

16:32.034 --> 16:34.167
Oh, no, I --
I mean my brother.

16:34.210 --> 16:36.996
Todd is great,
- but he's really shy.
- Oh.

16:37.039 --> 16:38.562
And he's done
so much for me,

16:38.606 --> 16:39.955
I'd love to help him find
somebody --

16:39.999 --> 16:41.304
Laura, I'm gonna interrupt you
right there,

16:41.348 --> 16:42.958
'cause we are all done
- with your echo.
- Okay.

16:43.002 --> 16:46.614
So I will see you
in the OR, okay?

16:46.657 --> 16:47.876
- Okay. Hm.
- Okay.

16:49.399 --> 16:51.967
Thank you.

16:56.972 --> 16:59.453
Please save me.
Okay, hang on.

16:59.496 --> 17:01.585
I think if we just --
like that?

17:01.629 --> 17:02.934
- Yeah.
- Okay.

17:02.978 --> 17:04.719
Thank you.

17:04.762 --> 17:06.895
I'm a PhD who can't remember
the essentials,

17:06.938 --> 17:09.028
like a portable charger
or potato chips.

17:10.377 --> 17:13.423
I have now mentioned my PhD
twice and you think I'm gross.

17:13.467 --> 17:16.905
Or smart, but I bet I've had
more years of training than you.

17:16.948 --> 17:18.515
Probably true.
Mm-hmm.

17:18.559 --> 17:21.170
So, Laura's surgery
is gonna take a few hours.
Mm.

17:21.214 --> 17:23.259
We can text you
when she's in recovery

17:23.303 --> 17:25.174
if you want to leave --No, no, no.
I'll stay.

17:25.218 --> 17:27.220
She probably doesn't care,
but I do.

17:27.263 --> 17:29.091
Besides, I got a sandwich

17:29.135 --> 17:31.485
and five episodes
of "Ready, Set, Globe!"

17:31.528 --> 17:33.139
I love that show!

17:33.182 --> 17:35.489
I'm rooting for Jasper and
his 75-year-old mom, Vicki.

17:35.532 --> 17:38.274
You think they can still win
after the unicycle accident?

17:38.318 --> 17:39.275
I-I --
Wait, what?

17:39.319 --> 17:41.190
Oh, crap.
Oh, my -- Oh, my God.

17:41.234 --> 17:42.974
Okay, forget
that I said that.

17:43.018 --> 17:46.195
I am going to scrub in
and let you catch up.

17:46.239 --> 17:47.849
Yes, please, before
you tell me something else

17:47.892 --> 17:49.459
- I don't need to hear.
- Okay, okay.

17:49.503 --> 17:52.201
Oh, oh. But the second-floor
vending machine

17:52.245 --> 17:54.812
has really amazing
salt and vinegar chips.

17:54.856 --> 17:56.597
That I needed.

17:56.640 --> 18:00.079
<i>Dr. Eisenberg, 4673.</i>

18:00.122 --> 18:03.212
Ivan, you may have had
some damage to your lungs.

18:03.256 --> 18:05.519
Your oxygen level's not
where we'd like it to be.

18:05.562 --> 18:07.651
Will you tell Clark
to take care of Gigi?

18:07.695 --> 18:09.131
And make sure he feeds her,

18:09.175 --> 18:11.177
because she gets testy
when she's hungry.

18:11.220 --> 18:12.961
Clearly.
I hate today.

18:13.004 --> 18:14.832
Um, we'll give him
the message.

18:14.876 --> 18:15.964
Uh, you need to focus
on you.

18:16.007 --> 18:17.270
Films are up.

18:17.313 --> 18:19.315
Oh, he's got
a big opacity.

18:19.359 --> 18:20.490
It could be blood.

18:20.534 --> 18:21.709
A rib could have punctured
a lung.

18:21.752 --> 18:23.493
Helm, let's put in
a chest tube.
On it.

18:23.537 --> 18:25.582
I think I see
some air-fluid levels.

18:25.626 --> 18:26.844
There's something else
going on here.

18:26.888 --> 18:28.324
Yeah, it's probably
a hemothorax.

18:28.368 --> 18:29.630
His O2's at 92.

18:29.673 --> 18:32.502
Which is why we can
and should scan him first.

18:32.546 --> 18:34.156
Bailey --Unless someone wants
to kill this man.

18:34.200 --> 18:35.940
Helm needs to put
that scalpel down!

18:35.984 --> 18:37.159
CT. Now.

18:38.421 --> 18:40.075
Come on, let's go.

18:40.119 --> 18:41.207
Let's go, let's go.
Yeah.

18:49.084 --> 18:51.521
These pythons still act hungry
once they've eaten,

18:51.565 --> 18:53.958
so their owners
will just feed them again.

18:54.002 --> 18:55.482
Puts them at risk
for obesity.

18:55.525 --> 18:57.919
What do they eat?
Mice?

18:57.962 --> 18:58.963
Arms.

18:59.007 --> 19:00.487
Well, the whole hospital
is talking

19:00.530 --> 19:02.663
about how you tamed
the snake, Bailey.

19:02.706 --> 19:04.360
You were
Indiana Jones.

19:04.404 --> 19:06.057
Indiana Jones
was afraid of snakes.

19:06.101 --> 19:08.190
Mm.

19:08.234 --> 19:10.279
Whoa.

19:10.323 --> 19:11.628
That, right there,
next to his lung...

19:11.672 --> 19:12.760
is that his liver?

19:12.803 --> 19:14.675
And his stomach
and colon.

19:14.718 --> 19:17.417
The pressure ruptured
his diaphragm,

19:17.460 --> 19:20.637
and his abdominal organs
herniated into the chest cavity.

19:20.681 --> 19:22.378
So if we would have inserted
the chest tube...

19:22.422 --> 19:24.772
It would have gone right through
his liver or bowel.

19:24.815 --> 19:26.513
You're welcome.
I'll book an OR.

19:33.302 --> 19:35.217
Do a lot of your patients
try to set you up?

19:35.261 --> 19:38.351
No. But I did get a baby
out of one of them.

19:39.656 --> 19:41.005
Isn't that kind of
your job now?

19:41.049 --> 19:42.398
She's talking about Luna,
Tseng.

19:44.095 --> 19:45.967
I was once hit on
by a patient.

19:46.010 --> 19:47.316
He was 15.

19:47.360 --> 19:48.709
He thought I was
a high school volunteer.

19:48.752 --> 19:50.145
I was 26.

19:50.189 --> 19:52.452
I'm just still trying
not to screw up motherhood

19:52.495 --> 19:53.844
and being an OB resident.

19:53.888 --> 19:55.194
I can't handle dating.

19:56.717 --> 19:57.935
Her BP's dropping fast.

19:57.979 --> 19:59.546
Fetal monitor
is showing decels.

19:59.589 --> 20:01.330
We need to increase
her tilt.

20:01.374 --> 20:02.853
Page an OB attending.

20:02.897 --> 20:04.203
Oh, she's coding.

20:04.246 --> 20:06.161
Let's start CPR.
Let's bag her.

20:12.036 --> 20:13.255
It's not working.
Push ephedrine.

20:13.299 --> 20:14.822
I'm gonna try
to reposition the baby,

20:14.865 --> 20:17.259
in case it's aortocaval
compression syndrome

20:17.303 --> 20:21.045
and her uterus is compressing
against her IVC and aorta.

20:21.089 --> 20:22.264
Isn't that why
she's tilted?

20:22.308 --> 20:23.961
Yes, but
it may not be enough.

20:24.005 --> 20:25.441
Okay, on the count of three,
turn her.

20:25.485 --> 20:28.314
One, two, three.

20:34.276 --> 20:35.364
Wow.

20:38.628 --> 20:40.978
Well, that's not what I would
call screwing up, Wilson.

20:44.417 --> 20:46.810
Have you ever seen
anything like this?

20:46.854 --> 20:49.248
A man's abdominal cavity
squeezed like toothpaste

20:49.291 --> 20:51.206
up into his chest
by a python?

20:51.250 --> 20:53.252
Nope, and I'm happy
to never see it again.

20:53.295 --> 20:54.992
It's a great
teaching case, though.

20:55.036 --> 20:56.298
You're lucky,
Helm and Wright.

20:56.342 --> 20:57.691
Are we?

20:57.734 --> 20:59.606
Well, we get to watch
a master at work.

20:59.649 --> 21:02.565
Yeah, a good teacher makes
- all the difference.
- Gauze.

21:02.609 --> 21:04.611
You ever had a mentor
during your residency?

21:04.654 --> 21:06.177
Yeah, sure did.

21:06.221 --> 21:08.092
She was a surgical genius.

21:08.136 --> 21:09.485
Also, hot.

21:09.529 --> 21:11.531
Yeah, I was smitten
from day one.

21:11.574 --> 21:14.534
It may not have been the best
reason to choose a specialty.

21:14.577 --> 21:16.840
But that's
what got you here,

21:16.884 --> 21:18.842
and you eventually
got over her, right?

21:18.886 --> 21:20.322
Nope.
I'm married to her.

21:20.366 --> 21:21.323
Dr. Pierce?

21:21.367 --> 21:23.107
Yeah, she was my teacher.

21:23.151 --> 21:24.108
That's how
it all started.

21:24.152 --> 21:25.109
Dr. Webber.

21:25.153 --> 21:27.155
Animal Control
finally arrived.

21:27.198 --> 21:29.853
Boyfriend's trying to decide
what to do about Gigi.

21:29.897 --> 21:32.073
Oh, Damn it.
Colon looks dusky.

21:33.901 --> 21:36.164
Oh, do you think
it's salvageable?

21:36.207 --> 21:38.688
Maybe. Here,
- let's pull down the liver.
- Mm-hmm.

21:40.386 --> 21:41.691
BP's dropping.

21:41.735 --> 21:43.867
Hang two units of blood.

21:43.911 --> 21:45.521
Suction.

21:45.565 --> 21:47.262
Help me find
the source.

21:50.700 --> 21:52.354
Okay, eight more.

21:52.398 --> 21:53.486
Just 'cause Megan wrote
those numbers on that sheet

21:53.529 --> 21:55.009
doesn't make them necessary.

21:55.052 --> 21:56.140
She's not my doctor.

21:56.184 --> 21:58.926
Well, PT doesn't
just improve mobility.

21:58.969 --> 22:01.232
It also helps prevent
post-surgical complications.

22:01.276 --> 22:03.017
You don't have to sell me
on physical therapy, okay?

22:03.060 --> 22:04.366
Well, then,
just keep going.

22:04.410 --> 22:05.715
I need a break.

22:05.759 --> 22:07.630
You can take a break after
you finish these rounds.

22:07.674 --> 22:09.371
You're not gonna be able
to walk or operate

22:09.415 --> 22:11.330
if you don't push yourself.

22:11.373 --> 22:12.505
Don't hold back.

22:12.548 --> 22:13.984
Don't hold back?

22:14.028 --> 22:15.812
Don't hold back?
Look at you, Teddy.

22:15.856 --> 22:17.118
You've been tiptoeing
around this house,

22:17.161 --> 22:19.555
pretending like
everything is fine.

22:19.599 --> 22:21.122
But please just stop,
okay?

22:21.165 --> 22:22.950
And look me in the eye,
for God's sake.

22:22.993 --> 22:24.212
Just keep doing
your therapy.

22:24.255 --> 22:25.735
It hurts!

22:25.779 --> 22:27.433
I'm holding back
because I'm in pain!

22:27.476 --> 22:28.303
So am I!

22:31.132 --> 22:33.352
I can't look at you because
I don't recognize you anymore.

22:44.188 --> 22:46.930
It's the TX2 robot arm.

22:46.974 --> 22:50.107
I read about it
in the hospital newsletter.

22:50.151 --> 22:52.153
- It's so precise.
- Yeah.

22:52.196 --> 22:54.503
And very strong,
so don't try to arm wrestle it.

22:54.547 --> 22:55.939
I won't.

22:57.767 --> 22:58.942
So, what would you do
with the money,

22:58.986 --> 23:00.944
if you got some
of this funding?

23:00.988 --> 23:02.337
What would I do?

23:02.381 --> 23:04.339
Uh, well,
I'd keep studying

23:04.383 --> 23:06.820
regeneration
stem cell therapies,

23:06.863 --> 23:09.126
expand my research
on xenotransplantation,

23:09.170 --> 23:10.258
stuff like that.

23:10.301 --> 23:11.651
Are you doing all of that?

23:11.694 --> 23:13.653
I mean, I'm always trying to
save more patients

23:13.696 --> 23:16.046
without someone having to die,
but it's -- it's difficult.

23:16.090 --> 23:17.961
And it takes time.
It takes money.

23:18.005 --> 23:19.746
Not everyone gets surprised

23:19.789 --> 23:21.574
with millions
in research funding.

23:21.617 --> 23:23.227
It's not like
I don't appreciate it.

23:23.271 --> 23:24.925
It's not like
I'm not grateful for it.

23:24.968 --> 23:27.580
You know about my life
and my kids in Seattle,

23:27.623 --> 23:29.146
and it really kind of
seems like

23:29.190 --> 23:30.757
this just got
a little bit more complicated.

23:30.800 --> 23:33.107
I could meet your kids.

23:33.150 --> 23:34.804
You could have a life here.

23:34.848 --> 23:37.198
But Hamilton just implied
that this money could help <i>you.</i>

23:37.241 --> 23:38.808
Wait, I'm sorry.
Did you just change the subject?

23:38.852 --> 23:41.420
No, that's me assessing
how complicated this is.

23:41.463 --> 23:42.551
So you think I'm in
a relationship with you

23:42.595 --> 23:44.597
to get grant funding?

23:44.640 --> 23:46.207
I told you
I have trust issues.

23:47.730 --> 23:49.645
I didn't mention my research
because it's not relevant

23:49.689 --> 23:51.604
to how I feel about you.

23:51.647 --> 23:53.693
I think what we have here
is pretty great.

23:53.736 --> 23:55.172
I'm in this, Meredith.

23:55.216 --> 23:56.783
But it seems like you take
things that are pretty great

23:56.826 --> 23:58.001
and you start looking
for the problems.

23:58.045 --> 23:59.394
You want me to take
the offer.

23:59.438 --> 24:00.569
I want you to do
what you want to do.

24:04.921 --> 24:06.140
I got to go check
on a patient,

24:06.183 --> 24:08.185
but...
it's your choice.

24:08.229 --> 24:11.101
It's your life, as much as
I'd like to share it with you.

24:21.285 --> 24:23.679
Push bicarb.
He's hemorrhaging
from his liver.

24:23.723 --> 24:26.116
Okay, he's unstable
and in full DIC.

24:26.160 --> 24:29.032
Okay, uh, let's pack him,
leave him open,

24:29.076 --> 24:31.644
and get him to the ICU
to stabilize him.

24:31.687 --> 24:33.559
We'll try again tomorrow.

24:33.602 --> 24:35.996
Let's get more lap pads
and get ready for a wound-vac.

24:36.039 --> 24:37.084
But what
do we tell Clark?

24:37.127 --> 24:38.694
Tell him to meet us
in the ICU.

24:39.521 --> 24:41.480
Oh. Oh, my gosh.

24:49.879 --> 24:51.141
Hi, um.
Hey.

24:51.185 --> 24:53.753
Laura and the baby
are both fine,

24:53.796 --> 24:55.929
but the fetus compressed
her major vein,

24:55.972 --> 24:57.670
causing her heart
to briefly stop,

24:57.713 --> 24:59.976
so we will need to reschedule
the procedure.

25:00.020 --> 25:02.544
Oh, uh.
Wow, okay.

25:02.588 --> 25:03.850
But s-she's fine?

25:03.893 --> 25:05.547
She's fine.
She's sleeping.

25:05.591 --> 25:07.070
I can take you
to see her, or...

25:07.114 --> 25:09.072
Do most people usually peek
at their person

25:09.116 --> 25:10.204
while they're sleeping?

25:10.247 --> 25:11.379
I'll let you know
when she wakes up.

25:11.422 --> 25:12.815
Great.
Okay.

25:12.859 --> 25:15.209
Um, h-how far did you get in
"Ready, Set, Globe!"?

25:15.252 --> 25:17.124
Erikk and Tiffany just found
the amulet

25:17.167 --> 25:18.952
in the cave in Thailand.Oh, yeah.

25:18.995 --> 25:22.129
So...
Right. Um, and you found
the vending machine.

25:22.172 --> 25:24.131
Yeah, I-I couldn't decide
what I wanted,

25:24.174 --> 25:25.785
- so I got one of everything.
- Right.

25:25.828 --> 25:27.003
Except salt and vinegar chips.

25:28.614 --> 25:31.051
I got two of those.
You hungry?

25:31.094 --> 25:33.619
Actually, starving, yeah.
Thank you.

25:33.662 --> 25:34.707
No, thank <i>you.</i>

25:34.750 --> 25:36.186
A-And just for the record,

25:36.230 --> 25:38.275
we're not weird
"Game of Thrones" siblings.

25:38.319 --> 25:40.234
I just worry about her.Yeah.

25:40.277 --> 25:41.452
- She'll be a great mom.
- Mm-hmm.

25:41.496 --> 25:43.454
And I want her to feel
a little less alone.

25:43.498 --> 25:45.979
She deserves more.

25:46.022 --> 25:48.198
Do you want to go
for a drink?

25:48.242 --> 25:50.679
Um, there's this bar
across the street, Joe's.

25:50.723 --> 25:52.115
- Not to be confused with me.
- Uh-huh.

25:52.159 --> 25:54.988
My name is also Jo, but, um,
I'm "Jo" without an "e."

25:55.031 --> 25:57.599
The bar does have an "e" --
This is a terrible idea.

25:57.643 --> 25:59.732
I'd love a drink.
I --

25:59.775 --> 26:02.038
Okay. Okay, great.

26:02.082 --> 26:03.170
Um...

26:03.213 --> 26:05.651
I just have to finish
my shift.

26:05.694 --> 26:07.478
Yeah, and I have to wait
- for my sister.
- Right.

26:07.522 --> 26:10.220
But after that,
Joe's with an "e"?

26:10.264 --> 26:11.831
Joe's with an "e."
Yeah.

26:11.874 --> 26:14.224
Okay.
Okay.

26:18.968 --> 26:22.537
For the past 20 years, you have
supported death with dignity.

26:22.581 --> 26:24.887
You don't get to make this
an ethical argument.

26:24.931 --> 26:26.236
You know that I support it.

26:26.280 --> 26:28.108
I've even helped patients
pursue it.

26:28.151 --> 26:29.936
But it's not about me.
You made a choice

26:29.979 --> 26:32.503
that put our family at risk
without even consulting me.

26:32.547 --> 26:34.636
If something happened, I didn't
want you to be implicated.

26:34.680 --> 26:36.856
Oh, so you're fine with me
raising our two kids alone?

26:36.899 --> 26:38.074
I was careful.

26:38.118 --> 26:40.076
Careful?
Was Heather Young careful?

26:40.120 --> 26:42.209
Do you even know the soldiers
that she gave the drugs to,

26:42.252 --> 26:43.514
or the families?

26:43.558 --> 26:46.256
What if a devastated kid
shows up at our door?

26:46.300 --> 26:48.650
What happens if he goes
to the military and tells them

26:48.694 --> 26:51.044
that his father ended his life
with drugs

26:51.087 --> 26:52.741
that a doctor gave him
illegally?!

26:52.785 --> 26:54.264
How do we know that
that won't happen?

26:54.308 --> 26:56.484
We don't.

26:56.527 --> 27:00.140
This will follow us for the rest
of our careers and our lives.

27:00.183 --> 27:02.229
And you made that decision
for me.

27:02.272 --> 27:03.578
And for our kids.

27:03.622 --> 27:06.712
I thought we were a team,
in good times and bad.

27:06.755 --> 27:08.148
Isn't that the promise
that we made?

27:08.191 --> 27:09.671
I was just trying
to protect you.

27:09.715 --> 27:11.412
I don't need protection!

27:11.455 --> 27:13.457
I have never
needed protection!

27:13.501 --> 27:15.677
I need my husband
and the father of my kids

27:15.721 --> 27:17.461
to not go to prison!

27:17.505 --> 27:18.811
Teddy, wait.
Wait, wait.

27:18.854 --> 27:20.116
No, you don't get to
just walk away.

27:20.160 --> 27:20.943
Wait!

27:22.031 --> 27:23.467
Oh, my God, Owen.

27:24.555 --> 27:26.949
Owen, you -- you walked.

27:28.124 --> 27:30.779
Huh.

27:30.823 --> 27:32.433
I walked.

27:40.441 --> 27:42.965
David Hamilton
is a showman,

27:43.009 --> 27:45.794
so it's hard for him
to understand people

27:45.838 --> 27:48.884
who don't respond positively
to public accolade.

27:48.928 --> 27:50.625
But I understand.

27:50.669 --> 27:53.976
And I am so sorry
he handled it the way he did,

27:54.020 --> 27:55.935
and I hope you don't let it
scare you away.

28:00.156 --> 28:01.810
Thanks.

28:05.161 --> 28:09.209
and it's unnecessary
- for you to apologize for him.
- Mm-hmm.

28:09.252 --> 28:10.645
And let me ask you
something --

28:10.689 --> 28:12.038
are you seeing my sister?

28:13.213 --> 28:16.303
We...are getting close,
yes.

28:16.346 --> 28:18.958
But that's not why I hope
you take this job.

28:19.001 --> 28:21.003
Or at least it's not
the main reason why.

28:23.049 --> 28:24.877
He reminds me of my mother.

28:24.920 --> 28:26.008
Because they worked
together?

28:26.052 --> 28:27.967
Because he's exactly
like her --

28:28.010 --> 28:31.405
his wants, his needs,
his demands,

28:31.448 --> 28:34.800
and that personality
is exhausting for anyone.

28:34.843 --> 28:36.192
But for me, it's --

28:36.236 --> 28:37.193
Triggering.

28:37.237 --> 28:39.761
I don't like
that word, but...

28:39.805 --> 28:41.284
How do you deal with him?

28:41.328 --> 28:44.853
Well, for me,
he's the opposite of triggering.

28:44.897 --> 28:48.596
He knew me before I changed
my name and my pronouns,

28:48.639 --> 28:50.293
and when I told him
my new name,

28:50.337 --> 28:54.384
he patted me on the back,
and he called me brave,

28:54.428 --> 28:56.256
and he told me
he was proud of me,

28:56.299 --> 28:57.648
and he never deadnamed me.

28:57.692 --> 28:59.172
He got right on board
with my pronouns

28:59.215 --> 29:01.391
while my parents continued
to insist

29:01.435 --> 29:04.264
that it was an impossible
adjustment to make.

29:06.832 --> 29:09.791
David can be demanding
and egotistical.

29:09.835 --> 29:12.838
But he respects people
and talent,

29:12.881 --> 29:15.144
and not everyone does.

29:15.188 --> 29:17.320
Plus, he told me
we'd change the world,

29:17.364 --> 29:19.714
and then we just put a big dent
in Parkinson's.

29:19.758 --> 29:20.454
We did do that, didn't we?

29:20.497 --> 29:21.498
We did do that.

29:23.152 --> 29:25.546
So he's got
a pretty good track record

29:25.589 --> 29:27.504
for keeping his promises.

29:32.118 --> 29:35.034
Check his lactic acid
and ABG every hour.

29:35.077 --> 29:37.514
He needs aggressive
fluid resuscitation.

29:38.646 --> 29:39.821
Damn it! V-fib.

29:39.865 --> 29:41.605
Starting compressions.

29:41.649 --> 29:43.520
Should we take him back
to the OR?

29:43.564 --> 29:44.826
Not if we want him
to make it.

29:44.870 --> 29:45.914
- Hold on, Chief.
- Okay.

29:45.958 --> 29:46.915
Let's go.

29:49.352 --> 29:51.398
Okay. Watch it.
- Watch your foot.
- Crash cart!

29:51.441 --> 29:53.443
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God! <i>Code Blue. Surgical ICU.</i>

29:53.487 --> 29:56.098
Okay. What's --
What's -- What's happening? <i>Code Blue. Surgical ICU.</i>

29:56.142 --> 29:57.665
What's going on?

29:57.708 --> 29:59.493
Push one of epi!

29:59.536 --> 30:00.755
You have to save him.
Please.

30:00.799 --> 30:02.278
Just do whatever,
just bring him back.

30:02.322 --> 30:03.802
Wright.
I just --

30:03.845 --> 30:04.803
Is he gonna be okay?

30:04.846 --> 30:06.369
- Get the paddles!
- Okay.

30:06.413 --> 30:07.718
Charge to 120.

30:07.762 --> 30:08.937
Clear!

30:11.200 --> 30:12.506
Charge 200!

30:19.905 --> 30:24.170
<i>Doug Andham to the ICU.</i>
<i>Doug Andham to the ICU.</i>

30:24.213 --> 30:25.693
Oh, hey, um...

30:25.736 --> 30:28.957
I saw that Ivan has
a displaced humerus fracture.

30:29.001 --> 30:31.046
I can join
when you do the ORIF,

30:31.090 --> 30:33.440
in case his radial nerve
is severed.

30:33.483 --> 30:34.528
Okay.

30:36.356 --> 30:38.401
I'm not sure how we lived
together that whole time

30:38.445 --> 30:41.709
without discovering
our mutual fear of snakes.

30:43.493 --> 30:45.365
Amelia...

30:45.408 --> 30:47.149
I can't.

30:47.193 --> 30:50.326
I-I-I really --
I can't do small talk with you.

30:50.370 --> 30:52.851
I -- I can't.

30:57.072 --> 30:58.900
You always said
that you didn't want us

30:58.944 --> 31:00.902
to end up
like your parents.

31:00.946 --> 31:02.861
You didn't want that
for Scout.

31:02.904 --> 31:05.646
I don't want that
for Scout.

31:05.689 --> 31:10.477
Can we just decide
to not hate each other?

31:13.045 --> 31:16.483
I need to hate you
for a little while,

31:16.526 --> 31:18.137
right or wrong,

31:18.180 --> 31:21.140
because when
I don't hate you...

31:21.183 --> 31:23.011
I love you.

31:23.055 --> 31:27.015
And we can't have that,
right?

32:11.277 --> 32:12.321
Is he gonna live?

32:12.365 --> 32:15.194
We are gonna do
everything we can.

32:15.237 --> 32:16.847
Mm.

32:16.891 --> 32:18.632
You look like
you could use some rest.

32:18.675 --> 32:20.503
Do you have a ride home?

32:20.547 --> 32:22.331
The man I love
let his pet snake

32:22.375 --> 32:25.247
literally squeeze the life
out of him.

32:25.291 --> 32:28.033
I'm not sure rest
is gonna help me get over that.

32:28.076 --> 32:29.643
I'm standing here,
thinking that I might need

32:29.686 --> 32:32.037
to reassess my entire life.

32:34.082 --> 32:39.870
Maybe...hold his hand
for a minute.

32:39.914 --> 32:41.437
Remind yourself
why you love him.

32:42.656 --> 32:44.049
Come on.

32:55.103 --> 32:57.714
He sent Gigi
to a rescue organization.

32:59.064 --> 33:01.849
I'm not sure I would be
as forgiving.

33:01.892 --> 33:03.851
Chief,
what you did today...

33:03.894 --> 33:07.333
it was an education
on so many levels.

33:07.376 --> 33:08.769
Dr. Wright...

33:10.118 --> 33:11.859
Um, thank you.

33:11.902 --> 33:15.297
I appreciate the vote
of confidence

33:15.341 --> 33:17.125
in how I perform my job,

33:17.169 --> 33:21.303
but before this grows
into a larger problem --

33:21.347 --> 33:23.392
It's -- It's not.
It's not.

33:23.436 --> 33:24.959
And it won't.

33:25.003 --> 33:27.440
I am very sorry
- for what I did.
- I --

33:27.483 --> 33:28.615
It was not appropriate.

33:28.658 --> 33:30.834
No, it wasn't.

33:30.878 --> 33:32.358
But you sent me a signal.

33:32.401 --> 33:33.446
No, I did not.

33:33.489 --> 33:35.665
Yes, you did, too.

33:35.709 --> 33:37.102
I mean, I don't know.

33:37.145 --> 33:39.843
I don't know, maybe you didn't
do it on purpose,

33:39.887 --> 33:42.368
or maybe you didn't think
I'd pick up on it,

33:42.411 --> 33:46.024
because you don't see yourself
that way, but I do.

33:46.067 --> 33:48.678
I see you, and I felt it.

33:51.333 --> 33:53.509
But I <i>am</i> sorry.

33:53.553 --> 33:54.902
And it won't happen again.

33:54.945 --> 33:56.164
Good night, Chief.

34:08.742 --> 34:10.918
You're exactly the person
I wanted to see right now.

34:10.961 --> 34:12.354
Hey.
Is everything okay?

34:12.398 --> 34:14.052
No.

34:14.095 --> 34:16.315
Today was tough,
but you want to go to Joe's

34:16.358 --> 34:17.403
before you pick up Luna?

34:17.446 --> 34:19.057
Oh, um --

34:19.100 --> 34:21.842
Sorry, I told my sister
we were getting a drink,

34:21.885 --> 34:24.366
and she may have raved about you
in a drug-induced haze

34:24.410 --> 34:25.367
for 10 minutes.

34:25.411 --> 34:26.368
You ready?

34:26.412 --> 34:27.587
Um...

34:27.630 --> 34:29.458
Uh, is ev-- You're...?

34:29.502 --> 34:31.112
- Go. You have plans.
- Okay.

34:31.156 --> 34:32.896
- Yeah, ready.
- Let's go.

34:44.691 --> 34:46.867
Okay.

34:46.910 --> 34:48.260
Here you go.
Thank you.

34:48.303 --> 34:49.304
Yeah.

34:49.348 --> 34:50.479
Put this one on there,
too.

34:50.523 --> 34:52.351
Thanks.
Yeah.

34:54.135 --> 34:55.397
I'm exhausted.

34:55.441 --> 34:57.225
Go to bed.
I'll be fine.

34:57.269 --> 34:59.053
I'll probably just fall asleep
on the couch.

34:59.097 --> 35:01.360
No, I mean...

35:01.403 --> 35:03.971
exhausted from this.

35:09.368 --> 35:13.328
Owen, I love you,
and I'm not gonna leave you,

35:13.372 --> 35:18.116
but I -- I need to know
that we come first --

35:18.159 --> 35:21.771
the kids, us, our family.

35:23.643 --> 35:26.036
I-I understand
why you did what you did.

35:26.080 --> 35:28.256
I understand your principles.
I understand your heart.

35:28.300 --> 35:30.824
But, Owen, I swear to God,

35:30.867 --> 35:32.869
don't do something
without talking to me.

35:34.349 --> 35:37.352
Trust me that I-I will figure
out how to support you.

35:37.396 --> 35:39.137
Trust me that
I will be there for you,

35:39.180 --> 35:42.923
or trust me that I will talk you
out of doing something stupid.

35:42.966 --> 35:46.056
But, please, just...

35:46.100 --> 35:48.494
come to me.

35:53.629 --> 35:55.327
I love you, too.

35:56.980 --> 35:58.330
I love you.

35:58.373 --> 35:59.766
I love you.

36:21.396 --> 36:23.224
Shhh!

36:23.268 --> 36:24.747
Oh.

36:24.791 --> 36:26.793
And how many books
tonight?

36:26.836 --> 36:29.839
One, but she, uh --

36:29.883 --> 36:31.580
she made me read it to her
five times.
Oh.

36:31.624 --> 36:33.974
How was your day?

36:34.017 --> 36:37.151
A python tried to eat
a person.

36:37.195 --> 36:40.459
Herniated his abdominal organs
into his chest.

36:40.502 --> 36:43.201
Mm. Dramatic.

36:48.945 --> 36:50.860
Have we been ignoring
a snake?

36:53.602 --> 36:55.125
What?

36:55.169 --> 36:58.564
Well, we're sending mixed
signals to other people.

36:58.607 --> 37:00.609
Oh, oh, no, no.
Ingrid never kissed me.

37:00.653 --> 37:03.221
A woman you rescued
thought you were

37:03.264 --> 37:06.398
inviting her on a date
to Thanksgiving dinner.

37:08.530 --> 37:10.271
Fair.
Mm.

37:10.315 --> 37:12.273
We have stressful jobs.

37:12.317 --> 37:14.406
We hardly see each other.

37:14.449 --> 37:17.409
We
adopted a teenager.

37:17.452 --> 37:20.716
We're doing
a custody battle.

37:20.760 --> 37:25.330
I-I'm worried
that we're feeding a life

37:25.373 --> 37:28.507
that might be squeezing
our marriage to death,

37:28.550 --> 37:30.291
and I don't want to do that,

37:30.335 --> 37:31.901
because
it's too important to me.

37:31.945 --> 37:34.295
You are too important to me
for anyone

37:34.339 --> 37:36.341
to mistakenly think
that we're available.
Yeah.

37:36.384 --> 37:37.472
Miranda Bailey.

37:38.952 --> 37:42.477
I am available to you.

37:42.521 --> 37:43.696
Mm.

37:45.480 --> 37:46.829
And only you.

37:46.873 --> 37:48.483
But you're right.

37:48.527 --> 37:50.268
We -- We haven't been spending
much time together.

37:50.311 --> 37:52.182
- And we got to fix that.
- Yeah.

37:52.226 --> 37:55.316
Also, I don't care how young
and handsome your resident is,

37:55.360 --> 37:57.666
you're never getting rid
of me.

37:58.841 --> 38:00.669
C'mere.

38:02.845 --> 38:03.890
Don't let go.

38:03.933 --> 38:05.500
Hell no.

38:05.544 --> 38:07.720
<i>When too much pressure</i>
<i>builds within your body,</i>

38:07.763 --> 38:10.505
<i>you might need a surgeon</i>
<i>to relieve it.</i>

38:10.549 --> 38:13.116
<i>We drill burr holes,</i>
<i>place chest tubes,</i>

38:13.160 --> 38:14.248
<i>cut open limbs.</i> Ohh.

38:14.292 --> 38:15.510
Richard.

38:15.554 --> 38:18.208
I thought you were working late
tonight, baby.

38:20.689 --> 38:23.257
I made, um,
a bad call today,

38:23.301 --> 38:25.520
and if a resident
had implemented it,

38:25.564 --> 38:26.739
it could have killed
a man.

38:28.741 --> 38:33.920
This morning, you said,
"Not everyone belongs in an OR."

38:33.963 --> 38:36.139
Well, I created
a teaching method,

38:36.183 --> 38:40.361
pressured you and Bailey
to let me implement it,

38:40.405 --> 38:44.409
and it may have ended a very
promising resident's career.

38:44.452 --> 38:46.715
And I might be bringing down
the rest of his class, too,

38:46.759 --> 38:49.327
and I can't,
in good conscience, do that.

38:49.370 --> 38:52.112
What are you suggesting?

38:52.155 --> 38:54.027
I want an assessment.

38:54.070 --> 38:56.508
A physical exam,
a cognitive review,

38:56.551 --> 38:59.859
a fine motor skills test --
I want it all.

38:59.902 --> 39:03.819
And if my judgment
is off...

39:03.863 --> 39:07.780
if I don't belong
in the OR anymore,

39:07.823 --> 39:09.477
then I want to know.

39:13.263 --> 39:15.788
<i>In life, relieving pressure's</i>
<i>not always as easy.</i>

39:17.659 --> 39:20.227
<i>But it's just as important.</i>

39:20.270 --> 39:21.794
<i>Too much stress takes</i>
<i>a toll</i>

39:21.837 --> 39:23.622
<i>on our mental</i>
<i>and physical health.</i>

39:25.232 --> 39:26.407
Hello?

39:26.451 --> 39:27.408
Hey!

39:27.452 --> 39:28.409
Mama!

39:28.453 --> 39:30.106
Hi!

39:30.150 --> 39:31.673
Hey!

39:31.717 --> 39:33.414
How's everybody doing?

39:33.458 --> 39:34.981
I missed you!

39:35.024 --> 39:36.286
Thank you
for picking them up.

39:36.330 --> 39:37.636
Oh, yeah.
No problem.

39:37.679 --> 39:39.812
I got to taste Ellis's
chocolate pudding surprise.

39:39.855 --> 39:41.944
The surprise
is gummy worms!

39:41.988 --> 39:43.424
Are you kidding?
Oh, my goodness!

39:43.468 --> 39:44.556
And I saved you some.

39:44.599 --> 39:45.948
Great.

39:45.992 --> 39:49.169
I'm going to the gym,
because Winston saw

39:49.212 --> 39:52.390
a two-for-one special,
so now I belong to a gym.

39:52.433 --> 39:54.000
- Wow.
- I thought you were
staying for dinner.

39:54.043 --> 39:55.697
You said set
five places.

39:55.741 --> 39:59.048
You know, I brought a guest
home for dinner.

39:59.092 --> 40:02.095
I brought my friend Nick
- from Minnesota, Dr. Marsh.
- Hello.

40:03.270 --> 40:04.967
You're curing Parkinson's
together?

40:05.011 --> 40:07.274
Uh, no,
I'm a transplant surgeon.

40:07.317 --> 40:08.493
Then how'd you meet?

40:08.536 --> 40:09.972
Uh, well, um...

40:10.016 --> 40:11.844
Your mom saved my life.

40:13.280 --> 40:14.324
Who's hungry?
Me!

40:14.368 --> 40:15.674
Okay.

40:15.717 --> 40:17.632
Do you like
chocolate pudding surprise?

40:17.676 --> 40:20.330
Uh, well, only
if the surprise is gummy worms.

40:20.374 --> 40:21.549
- It is!
- It is?!

40:21.593 --> 40:23.203
Let's have some, then.

40:23.246 --> 40:25.118
<i>So go for a walk.</i>

40:25.161 --> 40:27.773
<i>Meet up with a friend.</i>
<i>Dance it out.</i>

40:27.816 --> 40:29.601
Wow, okay.

40:29.644 --> 40:31.646
Chocolate pudding surprise.
Let's try it.

40:33.300 --> 40:35.389
Mmm!

40:35.433 --> 40:36.608
I love it.

40:36.651 --> 40:38.566
Very good.
Love it.

40:38.610 --> 40:39.524
You know what else I love,
though?

40:39.567 --> 40:40.525
Pizza.

40:40.568 --> 40:41.787
- Me, too.
- Yes.

40:41.830 --> 40:43.571
Me, three.
Alright.

40:43.615 --> 40:47.053
<i>Seek out the moments of joy</i>
<i>that keep us alive.</i>
