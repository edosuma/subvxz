30:56.344 --> 30:57.896
Coy: SO RIGHT NOW,
ME AND THE PAINT AND BODY CREW,

30:57.896 --> 31:00.137
WE'RE GOING TO START
PREPPING THE '69 PLYMOUTH

31:00.137 --> 31:02.172
"BRADY BUNCH"
WAGON FOR PAINT.

31:02.172 --> 31:04.448
TIME IS RUNNING OUT
TO GET IT READY FOR HGTV'S

31:04.448 --> 31:07.034
"BRADY BUNCH" HOUSE
RENOVATION REVEAL,

31:07.034 --> 31:08.689
SO WE BETTER GET TO MOVING.

31:08.689 --> 31:10.275
I JUST SEE A LOT OF TAPING
IN OUR FUTURE.

31:10.275 --> 31:11.758
IT'S GOING TO BE
A LOT OF TAPING,

31:11.758 --> 31:13.482
BUT AT LEAST IT'S NOT GOING
TO BE A LOT OF PUT IT TOGETHER,

31:13.482 --> 31:15.137
TAKE IT APART,
PUT IT TOGETHER, TAKE IT APART.

31:15.137 --> 31:17.034
RICHARD BOUGHT THE PLYMOUTH
FOR 15 GRAND,

31:17.034 --> 31:18.827
AND HE'S GIVEN US
A BUDGET OF 15 GRAND.

31:18.827 --> 31:20.793
SO THAT'S ALL-IN AT $30,000.

31:20.793 --> 31:23.000
AS STEEP AS THAT SOUNDS,
RICHARD FIGURES

31:23.000 --> 31:24.793
THAT THE EXPOSURE
THAT GAS MONKEY WILL GET

31:24.793 --> 31:27.034
ON HGTV,
IT'S WORTH IT.

31:27.034 --> 31:28.275
THERE'S A WOODGRAIN DECAL

31:28.275 --> 31:30.448
THAT WRAPS AROUND
THE ENTIRE BOAT OF THE CAR.

31:30.448 --> 31:31.827
I'M GETTING LUCKY.

31:31.827 --> 31:33.137
TONY AND KEENAN ARE GOING
TO START PUTTING A HEAT GUN

31:33.137 --> 31:34.758
TO THE FENDERS.

31:34.758 --> 31:35.931
MAYBE NOT.

31:35.931 --> 31:38.827
AND I HAVE A GENIUS PLAN
FOR THE REST OF THE CAR.

31:38.827 --> 31:40.172
Coy: LET'S TRY ROLLING IT
IN THE PAINT BOOTH

31:40.172 --> 31:41.655
AND PUTTING IT ON BAKE.

31:41.655 --> 31:44.137
STRIPPING VINYL OFF THE SIDE
OF A CAR IS WORSE THAN REMOVING

31:44.137 --> 31:45.862
A PRICE STICKER
FROM THE SOLE OF YOUR SHOE.

31:45.862 --> 31:47.896
ANYBODY GOT A ROAST,
WANT TO MAKE A ROAST?

31:47.896 --> 31:50.344
BUT HERE'S WHAT CAN MAKE IT
EASIER, SOME HEAT.

31:50.344 --> 31:53.275
THE PAINT BOOTH CAN BE HEATED
AS HIGH AS 160 DEGREES.

31:53.275 --> 31:55.379
I CAN'T THINK OF A BETTER WAY
TO SPEND

31:55.379 --> 32:00.551
THE AFTERNOON THAN PEELING VINYL
IN A HOT BRIGHT BOX.

32:00.551 --> 32:02.000
DID I MENTION IT WAS HOT?

32:02.000 --> 32:04.517
IT'S HOTTER THAN THE DOGHOUSE
ON THE "BRADY BUNCH" SET,

32:04.517 --> 32:12.310
WHERE BOBBY AND CINDY BRADY
USED TO HANG OUT AND SMOOCH.

32:12.310 --> 32:13.413
WHY DON'T Y'ALL COME HELP ME?

32:13.413 --> 32:16.344
Tony: HELL NO,
LOOK AT YOURSELF.

32:16.344 --> 32:17.758
-IT'S HOT IN THERE.
-YOU THINK?

32:17.758 --> 32:18.965

REALLY QUICK.

NOW WE HAVE TO WELD UP ALL THE
HOLES FROM THE CHROME TRIM.

32:31.965 --> 32:33.137
WE ONLY PULLED THE SIDE TRIM.

32:33.137 --> 32:34.655
THE REST OF THE TRIM IS STAYING.

32:34.655 --> 32:38.034
I KNOW I COUNTED 54
JUST ON THIS ONE SIDE.

32:38.034 --> 32:39.965
DID YOU COUNT THE FENDERS?I HAVEN'T COUNTED THE FENDERS.

32:39.965 --> 32:42.793
WE GOT ABOUT 120, AT LEAST.YEAH.

32:42.793 --> 32:46.310

EACH HOLE TAKES 10 MINUTES,

32:46.310 --> 32:47.931
THAT'S 20 MAN-HOURS.
