It wasn't my father,
but Freddie Mercury

00:09.096 --> 00:11.098
and David Bowie

00:11.141 --> 00:13.535
who warned about the dangers
of cracking under pressure.

00:13.578 --> 00:15.972
I keep it in the back
of my mind on every op.

00:16.016 --> 00:19.367
While pressure can be
a destructive interaction,

00:19.410 --> 00:21.891
one hundred miles below
the Earth's upper mantle,

00:21.934 --> 00:24.285
it combines with heat
to create something beautiful.

00:24.328 --> 00:25.895
Something strong.

00:25.938 --> 00:28.637
Something that I really hope
I can replicate...

00:28.680 --> 00:30.117
in my kitchen.

00:30.160 --> 00:32.510
[knocking]Hey!

00:32.554 --> 00:34.947
[rock music playing over radio]Hey.

00:34.991 --> 00:36.906
[laughing]:
Dolo Boze!

00:36.949 --> 00:38.081
Just in time. Come on in.

00:38.125 --> 00:39.735
Close the door.Oh, what the...?

00:39.778 --> 00:42.042
Yeah, it's a chemical vapor
deposition system.

00:42.085 --> 00:44.087
I just spent the last
15 hours sucking air

00:44.131 --> 00:45.741
out of its vacuum chamber,
and then I added hydrogen

00:45.784 --> 00:49.614
to grow carbon seeds,
atom by atom. Isn't that cool?

00:49.658 --> 00:51.094
I'm not sure.
Why are you smiling like that?

00:51.138 --> 00:52.617
You inhale something?

00:52.661 --> 00:56.186
[laughing]: Actually,
that's entirely possible.

00:56.230 --> 00:59.015
But that is not why
I called you over here today.

01:05.152 --> 01:05.935

Wilt.

01:11.897 --> 01:13.595
Angus.

01:13.638 --> 01:15.553
For months, it's been like

01:15.597 --> 01:17.425
Desi and I have been caught
in this tug-of-war

01:17.468 --> 01:20.080
between how we feel
about each other and our jobs.

01:20.123 --> 01:21.864
We're on, we're off,
we're on, we're off,

01:21.907 --> 01:23.170
but things have been
great lately.

01:23.213 --> 01:26.390
Really great,
so I decided...

01:27.696 --> 01:29.176
...to...

01:29.219 --> 01:30.873
Ooh.

01:36.052 --> 01:37.097
To make...

01:40.796 --> 01:42.841
Mac,

01:42.885 --> 01:44.495
that's a...

01:44.539 --> 01:46.193
That's a diamond.Yeah.

01:46.236 --> 01:48.412
I'm gonna ask Desi to marry me.

01:50.197 --> 01:52.155
Oh...Unexpected?

01:52.199 --> 01:54.592
I know. I know,
but... [sighs]

01:54.636 --> 01:56.203
That's what I like
about it, you know?

01:56.246 --> 01:58.727
Ever since I lost
my dad and Jack,

01:58.770 --> 02:00.163
I've been thinking
about the bigger picture,

02:00.207 --> 02:01.904
and a commitment
to make things work is exactly

02:01.947 --> 02:03.035
what Desi and I need.

02:03.079 --> 02:06.387
A grand, romantic gesture.

02:10.956 --> 02:12.262
[laughs]

02:12.306 --> 02:13.829
Huh?

02:16.223 --> 02:17.876
Come here, man.

02:17.920 --> 02:20.227
Come here.
Congratulations.

02:20.270 --> 02:22.620
[groans, laughs]
Okay.

02:22.664 --> 02:25.014
I'm happy for you.Well, thanks, man.

02:25.057 --> 02:27.234
It was, um,
super important to me

02:27.277 --> 02:29.758
that you were
the first one to know.

02:29.801 --> 02:32.369
So, when are you
popping the question?

02:32.413 --> 02:34.197
When...[phone chimes, buzzes]

02:34.241 --> 02:35.807
I wonder who that could be.

02:35.851 --> 02:38.593
She wants us
at Phoenix.

02:38.636 --> 02:41.291
Hey, um, when you propose,
consider skipping the part

02:41.335 --> 02:43.815
about how you made
the rock yourself.

02:43.859 --> 02:46.905
Okay. Whatever you say.Okay.

02:46.949 --> 02:48.907
All right.All right.

Whoa. Taylor.

03:29.774 --> 03:31.559
Love what you've
done with the place.TAYLOR: Oh, good.

03:31.602 --> 03:35.215
You're here.What is all of this stuff?

03:35.258 --> 03:36.738
TAYLOR: These are
documents and files

03:36.781 --> 03:39.175
confiscated from Codex's bunker
in Montana.

03:39.219 --> 03:42.265
I, uh... I can process it
more efficiently

03:42.309 --> 03:44.615
if I have it all spread out
ahead of me.

03:44.659 --> 03:46.574
You know? That way, I can see
the-the bigger picture at once.

03:46.617 --> 03:49.272
Cool, but why?
And where's Matty?

03:49.316 --> 03:51.318
Um, just, uh,
tape those up there

would you, darling?

03:53.102 --> 03:55.017
Uh, Matty. Yes, of course.
I'm getting ahead of myself. Ah!

03:55.060 --> 03:56.279
[chuckles]

03:56.323 --> 03:57.802
Matty, you're on with the team.

03:57.846 --> 03:59.108
Hey, all, I'm out of town

03:59.151 --> 04:00.936
handling some
unfinished business,

04:00.979 --> 04:03.373
but something's come up and it
can't wait for me to get back.

04:03.417 --> 04:05.810
For weeks, Phoenix has been
working around the clock

04:05.854 --> 04:08.552
to decipher a message
sent by whoever

04:08.596 --> 04:10.250
is pulling the strings at Codex

04:10.293 --> 04:11.947
to all of its cell leaders.

04:11.990 --> 04:13.905
The worldwide wake-up call.

04:13.949 --> 04:15.472
TAYLOR: Exactly right.
And just this morning

04:15.516 --> 04:16.647
I managed to crack their code.

04:16.691 --> 04:18.693
Except, unfortunately...

04:21.522 --> 04:24.438
It was a code within a code?Well, that sucks.

04:24.481 --> 04:26.222
Yes. Donkeys.

04:26.266 --> 04:28.311
The message is
comprised of variations

04:28.355 --> 04:30.226
of the astronomical symbol

04:30.270 --> 04:32.924
for Earth, which Codex
has used in the past.

04:32.968 --> 04:35.710
But these little buggers,

04:35.753 --> 04:37.059
I've never seen them before.

04:37.102 --> 04:39.061
Hence all the stuff
from their bunker.

04:39.104 --> 04:40.323
You're looking for past uses

04:40.367 --> 04:41.716
of these characters
to crack the code. Yeah.

04:41.759 --> 04:43.718
Yes, and while we work
to solve the message,

04:43.761 --> 04:45.459
we do have another
actionable lead

04:45.502 --> 04:47.635
about where the message
was sent from.

04:47.678 --> 04:49.158
Mexico City.

04:49.201 --> 04:50.551
TAYLOR:
Yes, specifically,

04:50.594 --> 04:52.683
Plaza Loreto.

04:52.727 --> 04:53.945
RILEY: That message
could've been sent

04:53.989 --> 04:56.165
from any one of those buildings.

04:56.208 --> 04:57.993
Could that be the location
of Codex's new headquarters?

04:58.036 --> 05:00.082
Well, that's one theory,
but the bottom line is

05:00.125 --> 05:01.605
we just don't know,
and we must find out

05:01.649 --> 05:03.607
before whatever it is
they're plotting is executed.

05:03.651 --> 05:05.914
Bozer, I want you working
with Taylor to crack the code.

05:05.957 --> 05:08.351
Mac, Riley, Desi,

05:08.395 --> 05:10.135
you're wheels up to Mexico City.

All right, comms check.

05:24.802 --> 05:26.195
One, two.

05:26.238 --> 05:27.239
Loud and clear.

05:27.283 --> 05:29.067
Riles?
Good to go.

05:29.111 --> 05:30.808
All right.

05:32.593 --> 05:34.290
Hi, guys.

05:34.334 --> 05:36.640
RILEY: All right, Boze.Hey, uh, Riley?

05:36.684 --> 05:37.554
Matty wanted me to run
one last thing by you.

05:37.598 --> 05:38.816
What's up?

05:40.557 --> 05:42.820
Okay, look, I'm gonna tell
you something that I really,

05:42.864 --> 05:43.821
really shouldn't be
telling anyone,

05:43.865 --> 05:45.388
but I'm gonna do it anyway,

05:45.432 --> 05:46.737
because I don't know
when it's gonna happen

05:46.781 --> 05:48.652
and I think
you deserve a heads-up.

05:49.653 --> 05:51.394
Okay.

05:51.438 --> 05:52.395
It has to do with
that thing we agreed

05:52.439 --> 05:53.396
never to speak about again.

05:55.746 --> 05:57.182
About Mac.

call it out.

We'll follow on satellite
as you tail them

06:40.487 --> 06:41.488
back to where the message
was sent from.

06:41.531 --> 06:42.793
Got it.

06:42.837 --> 06:43.794
DESI:
Copy.

06:43.838 --> 06:45.013
Copy that.

06:49.060 --> 06:50.932

Russ, any luck
cracking what it says?

06:50.975 --> 06:53.021
TAYLOR:
Not yet.

06:53.064 --> 06:55.458
The message certainly looks
like Codex's language,

06:55.502 --> 06:57.982
but we can't find any evidence
of these specific characters

06:58.026 --> 07:00.071
in any of their communications.

07:01.899 --> 07:03.510
Is it possible that they've
evolved their symbology

07:03.553 --> 07:05.250
since Phoenix raided
their bunker?

Don't be shy, Angus.

07:32.016 --> 07:33.670
Admit it.

you missed me.

The one and only.

07:50.121 --> 07:52.863
How are you on our comms?
Phoenix locked you up.

07:52.907 --> 07:54.038
Clearly not well enough.

07:54.082 --> 07:57.259
Now pay attention.

07:57.302 --> 08:01.437
I want you to imagine yourself
like the avatar in a video game,

08:01.481 --> 08:06.573
only doing precisely what the
player controlling you demands.

08:06.616 --> 08:09.358
Remove your comms earpiece
or tell anybody else

08:09.401 --> 08:10.838

that information.

08:35.166 --> 08:36.690
to hack our comms
from halfway around the world,

but you don't have
anybody in danger.

Angus, I am disappointed.

You should know me
better than that by now.

Welcome to level one.

09:20.211 --> 09:22.039
You have 30 minutes

to get to the skyscraper
at the corner

09:32.920 --> 09:34.574
What the hell?

09:34.617 --> 09:35.705
MacGYVER:
That's on the other side
of the city.

09:35.749 --> 09:37.272
Then you better get moving.

09:37.315 --> 09:38.142
What's on the other side
of the city?

09:38.186 --> 09:41.537
The clock starts...

...now.

Mac!

09:57.161 --> 09:58.336
Okay.

09:58.380 --> 09:59.599
Ditched my phone.
But this is impossible.

09:59.642 --> 10:01.426
There's no direct path
to the skyscraper.

10:01.470 --> 10:03.515
Well, you didn't think
I'd set the difficulty level

10:03.559 --> 10:05.256
at easy, did you?

10:05.300 --> 10:07.302
A car couldn't make it there
in 30 minutes.

10:07.345 --> 10:09.391
That's the amount of time
you have.

10:09.434 --> 10:10.871
I wouldn't waste it

10:10.914 --> 10:12.350
complaining about the rules.

10:34.024 --> 10:35.243
Say cheese.

10:38.638 --> 10:40.291
What do you mean,
he just took off?I don't know,

10:40.335 --> 10:42.119
he was acting weird, he was
talking to himself out loud

10:42.163 --> 10:43.686
like the parrot guy
on Venice Beach,

10:43.730 --> 10:45.775
and then he grabbed
my map and ran.

10:45.819 --> 10:46.689
He didn't tell you
where he was going?Something about

10:46.733 --> 10:48.125

10:54.088 --> 10:55.480
I don't have his location.

10:55.524 --> 10:57.831
His comms and GPS locator
went off-line.

10:57.874 --> 10:59.659
If he wasn't talking
to one of us,
