Mother nature's piss.

And it's what brings us
here today, together.

00:14.687 --> 00:19.100
The unveiling of my luxurious,
brand new swimming pool.

00:19.133 --> 00:20.933
That's right.
I did this.

00:20.966 --> 00:22.941
My own brother,

00:23.006 --> 00:25.642
so full of envy
over my success,

00:25.683 --> 00:28.516
that son of a bitch didn't even
show up here today.

00:28.581 --> 00:29.916
But his wife showed up.

00:29.950 --> 00:32.423
Cassie, big ups to you
for being supportive.

00:32.456 --> 00:34.865
You've got much bigger balls
than your husband does.

00:34.898 --> 00:36.466
Much better man than him.

00:36.531 --> 00:38.466
Mere months ago,

00:38.499 --> 00:41.977
I was in the darkest, dirtiest,
shittiest hole of my life.

00:42.010 --> 00:45.781
Standing in a crowded room
while my wife was being honored.

00:45.822 --> 00:48.190
And I was miserable.

00:48.255 --> 00:50.856
But finally, all the struggles
and sleepless nights...

00:50.897 --> 00:52.533
[Gene] Dixie. Dixie?

00:52.598 --> 00:54.643
Dixie!

00:54.676 --> 00:56.510
Get out of here, Gene.
Security, get him

00:56.543 --> 00:57.646
- the fuck out of here.
- I need to talk to you, baby.

00:57.679 --> 00:59.615
I love you! What the
fuck are you doing?

00:59.648 --> 01:02.090
- Get off me!
- Gene...

01:02.123 --> 01:03.756
- No adulterers allowed.
- [Gene] Put me the fuck down, asshole!

01:03.797 --> 01:07.142
- Loser.
- Anyway, what I was saying was

01:07.175 --> 01:10.210
even though things were
that dark, I persevered.

01:10.251 --> 01:12.914
And I never stopped going
for what I wanted.

01:12.947 --> 01:14.222
And now look what's happened.

01:14.255 --> 01:17.395
Oops. Somebody got a
salt water motherfucking pool.

01:17.428 --> 01:20.838
That's right. So let
the deep sparkly waters

01:20.871 --> 01:22.406
serve as a symbol
to each of you,

01:22.439 --> 01:24.343
that if you work hard enough,

01:24.376 --> 01:26.207
you dream big enough,

01:26.240 --> 01:28.377
anything is possible.

were talking about my award today.

02:04.486 --> 02:06.992
You said that
you were miserable.

02:07.025 --> 02:09.544
Mmm. I think maybe you need to
stop paying attention to that shit

02:09.567 --> 02:11.735
and you need
to come over here...

02:11.768 --> 02:13.408

- Whoo. Look at this.
- Hm-mm.

02:19.119 --> 02:20.791
- I think I'm about to pay for this shit.
- Don't get close to me.

- You can not do that.
- I can do it.

- Shake it.
- Look at you being so obnoxious with money.

02:31.970 --> 02:34.238
Why you trying to cause
class warfare on my ass here?

Insult a man 'cause I'm trying
to share my wealth.

02:36.113 --> 02:38.281
I think that
you're losing touch.

02:38.314 --> 02:39.713
- Speaking of losing touch.
- What?

talking to Tel and Viv

02:44.390 --> 02:46.126
about their therapist
that they're seeing.

02:46.159 --> 02:47.327
- A therapist?
- Yep.

they try to fucking
smooth everybody out,

keep everybody even,
walking in a straight line.

03:02.076 --> 03:03.379
I got no interest in that.

03:03.412 --> 03:05.179
The only kind of therapy
you need

is that ding-a-ling therapy.

"N" is for and.
And the final "T"...

08:34.698 --> 08:37.663
...Tits. 'Cause all
the waitresses at TNT

08:37.696 --> 08:41.866
- have huge tits. Taters 'N' Tits.
- Oh my God.

08:41.899 --> 08:44.001
How on earth did you
even think of this?

08:44.034 --> 08:45.569
How does any genius
figure out his inventions?

08:45.601 --> 08:47.999
I mean, how did Leonardo DiCaprio
figure out about gravity?

08:48.033 --> 08:50.400
'Cause the bitch was sleeping underneath
a tree and an apple hit him on his head.

08:50.441 --> 08:53.408
This is amazing.
I'm all over this.

08:53.473 --> 08:57.076
Whew. Look at the men
we've become, huh. [chuckles]

08:57.109 --> 09:00.542
And on a personal side note, those
contacts are doing wonders for your look.

09:00.583 --> 09:04.083
- Oh... Oh, thank you.
- You got those Paul Walker eyes.

09:04.148 --> 09:06.881
I'm thinking about fixing
my other weak zones too.

09:06.914 --> 09:07.849
Oh, like your chin?

09:07.882 --> 09:09.851
Wha...

09:09.884 --> 09:11.282
My ch...
What's wrong with my chin?

09:11.323 --> 09:13.753
See, it's almost just like
a high neck fold.

09:13.818 --> 09:16.151
From your profile here,
it's just face

09:16.192 --> 09:18.052
down to tits.
It's just nothing.

09:18.085 --> 09:20.651
It's like a fucking little nub
at the bottom of your face.

09:20.692 --> 09:30.728
Yeah, my chin is shitty.

09:30.761 --> 09:32.295
Goddamn it.

09:32.328 --> 09:33.966
[truck door shuts]

09:33.999 --> 09:37.075
OK. Look, Kenny is here.

09:37.108 --> 09:39.909
Don't freak out, OK?
He brought gifts for the boys.

09:39.942 --> 09:44.578
Honey, he wants forgiveness.
All right?

09:44.611 --> 09:47.945
- Maybe just hear him out.
- [gunfire]

09:47.978 --> 09:53.091
[rock music playing]

09:53.124 --> 09:56.426
Oh! Fuck yeah! Huh?
Love that shit.

09:56.459 --> 09:58.090
Doesn't it feel good? Man, you
just take that deep breath.

09:58.123 --> 10:00.960
Bow! Shoot a man
right in his heart. Ha-ha.

10:00.993 --> 10:03.265
Meatloaf, how you
liking that guitar?

10:03.298 --> 10:04.601
- It's the shit, huh?
- [Dustin Jr] Yeah.

10:04.634 --> 10:05.665
- [Kenny] Yeah.
- Hey!

10:05.698 --> 10:07.698
Yo, Dustin.
What's up?

10:07.738 --> 10:09.673
- I came to buy back your forgiveness.
- The fuck are you doing

10:09.705 --> 10:11.637
- giving my kid an assault rifle.
- Hey, man.

10:11.670 --> 10:12.902
Dustin Jr
is a well adjusted kid.

10:12.935 --> 10:14.576
He's responsible enough
to own an assault rifle.

10:14.609 --> 10:17.240
Notice I didn't get Wayne one.
I'm thinking this thing through.

10:17.281 --> 10:18.912
Take it back.
Return it.

10:18.945 --> 10:20.216
You should hold on to that, man.
They're about to ban that shit.

10:20.249 --> 10:21.616
I'm trying to protect your
household. How much?

10:21.649 --> 10:22.648
- What are you doing?
- Come on.

10:22.681 --> 10:24.417
How much is your
forgiveness worth?

10:24.450 --> 10:26.291
Put your money away.
Take the damn rifle.

10:26.356 --> 10:28.261
Say a number.
I'll break you a piece off.

10:28.294 --> 10:31.696
No. Not a chance. Take it. Take the guitar.
Get the fuck off my property.

10:31.737 --> 10:34.030
God, Dustin. Can't you just
grow up for a second?

10:34.071 --> 10:36.839
I'm trying to reach out to you and
be the bigger man, all right?

10:36.872 --> 10:39.306
I... love you, brother.

10:39.339 --> 10:41.345
And I just wanna
discuss our issues.

10:41.378 --> 10:43.513
I'm just trying to
make good here, all right?

10:43.546 --> 10:45.377
I don't know how to fucking
make up with people, all right?

10:45.449 --> 10:47.048
It's not something
I usually do.

10:47.081 --> 10:48.785
But for whatever reason,
it's important to me

10:48.818 --> 10:51.222
that you and I
are just not enemies.

10:51.263 --> 10:53.894
It just doesn't feel right. I feel like
things are all fucked up and gross

10:53.927 --> 10:56.135
just because you and I aren't friends.
I don't like it.

10:56.168 --> 10:59.272
Dustin, he is clearly hurting.
I mean, look at him.

10:59.305 --> 11:01.411
Ow. Owie.

11:01.444 --> 11:04.444
- OK. Come on. Be the bigger man.
- I'm hurting. Help me.

11:04.509 --> 11:06.074
[Cassie] OK.
Just tell him how you feel.

11:06.115 --> 11:07.476
You wanna get
into this right here?

11:07.481 --> 11:09.143
I'd love to, brother.

11:09.216 --> 11:11.480
For one thing,
you really hurt me.

11:11.513 --> 11:14.292
- When you... when you faked your own death.
- I know.

11:14.325 --> 11:15.589
And we were all really worried,
Kenny.

11:15.622 --> 11:16.759
- [cell phone chimes]
- Hold on for one second.

11:16.792 --> 11:18.030
Just, my shit's
blowing up real quick.

11:18.063 --> 11:19.692
- Kenny, I'm talking to you.
- Yeah. Oh, fuck.

11:19.725 --> 11:21.193
- I thought we were gonna...
- Guy Young just text me.

11:21.226 --> 11:23.023
Kenny, you just said
you wanted to talk about this.

11:23.056 --> 11:25.591
No, I do but, yeah.
It's Guy Young. He's my boss.

11:25.632 --> 11:26.663
- It's work, so...
- [phone chimes]

11:26.696 --> 11:28.734
[laughing]

11:28.767 --> 11:30.766
This motherfucker sends
the funniest emoticons.

11:30.799 --> 11:32.901
- Put the phone away.
- [phone chimes]

11:32.934 --> 11:34.363
Oh, he wants me
to come out to the lake.

11:34.404 --> 11:36.372
[chuckles] OK, look.
You're obviously upset.

11:36.406 --> 11:39.438
I can see that. Why don't you
just gather your thoughts.

11:39.511 --> 11:41.342
Really think about
what's hurting you

11:41.375 --> 11:43.278
and then figure out a good way
to like, formulay it

11:43.311 --> 11:44.878
- that everyone can understand.
- Formulate it.

11:44.911 --> 11:46.118
That's what I said, all right?

11:46.151 --> 11:48.319
Love you guys.
Really nice to see everyone.

11:48.352 --> 11:53.764
Before I go...

11:53.797 --> 12:09.181
Love you guys.

12:16.718 --> 12:21.790
What the fuck is that?

12:21.823 --> 12:25.199
[Guy] Whoa. There he is,
Kenny Powers.

12:25.232 --> 12:28.904
Guy! [laughs]

12:28.937 --> 12:32.439
- What's up, KP?
- You look cool as fuck out there, dude!

12:32.472 --> 12:36.681
- Woo!
- [Kenny] It's fucking priceless.

12:36.714 --> 12:39.715
- Woo!
- Holy shit!

12:39.748 --> 12:42.853
- [Kenny] Goddamn.
- Pretty impressive little unit, huh?

12:42.917 --> 12:44.284
Dude, that's it. I'm fucking
getting one of those.

12:44.325 --> 12:46.492
- That's the shit.
- Yeah, well, they're about

12:46.525 --> 12:48.124
a quarter million a pop, so...

12:48.157 --> 12:50.892
I think they might be a little
bit out of your range there, KP.

12:50.933 --> 12:51.964
I might have to check
with the wife.

12:51.997 --> 12:53.262
[laughter]

12:53.303 --> 12:55.200
I still think it might be
a little out of your range.

12:55.241 --> 12:57.240
Well, we'll see.
I'll check with my wife.

12:57.273 --> 12:59.639
Speaking of which, I wanted to talk
to you about the show for a minute.

12:59.672 --> 13:01.839
- OK, yeah. What's up?
- Look. Kenny,

13:01.880 --> 13:03.511
I don't wanna... I don't
wanna hurt your feelings,

13:03.544 --> 13:05.544
you know what I mean? But
I feel like you need to take

13:05.585 --> 13:07.882
your performance down...
a little bit on the show.

13:07.923 --> 13:10.388
- Just take it down a notch.
- Oh yeah?

13:10.421 --> 13:12.691
I'm just doing
what you told me to do.

13:12.724 --> 13:14.724
Just being myself, man. Wild
card's gonna be wild, right?

13:14.765 --> 13:16.535
- [laughter]
- Sure, sure.

13:16.568 --> 13:18.137
But... [sighs]
If I'm being honest,

13:18.170 --> 13:19.538
I'm starting to see
shades of Dontel here.

13:19.571 --> 13:22.979
- Ew, yuck. Are you serious?
- Little bit.

13:23.013 --> 13:24.349
I mean, case in point.

13:24.382 --> 13:26.816
You know how nobody
came over for the nacho bit?

13:26.849 --> 13:28.520
But you came over
for the nacho bit.

13:28.585 --> 13:31.088
You don't have to come over for every bit.
You know what I mean?

13:31.120 --> 13:32.958
- You don't have to do that.
- Well, I mean,

13:32.991 --> 13:34.821
I just was kinda feeling
the vibe of the audience.

13:34.854 --> 13:35.956
You know, I thought
I had 'em in stitches.

13:35.989 --> 13:37.493
Right, right.
But if you come over

13:37.526 --> 13:39.433
and you eat the peppers and
then I can't eat the peppers

13:39.466 --> 13:43.537
then I'm left with no options. I'm
painted into a corner, right?

13:43.570 --> 13:45.306
I look like a fucking boob.

13:45.339 --> 13:47.074
Well, dude, I'm not trying to
make you look like boobs.

13:47.107 --> 13:49.506
I just... I didn't think eating
peppers was like your thing.

13:49.611 --> 13:51.978
It's not about the
goddamn peppers, Kenny!

13:52.011 --> 13:54.648
OK? It's about
your place on the show.

13:54.713 --> 13:56.948
I mean, like this
fucking jet pack.

13:56.981 --> 13:59.379
I spent my whole life
working my ass off

13:59.412 --> 14:00.777
to afford something like this

14:00.811 --> 14:02.080
and then you walk up
and you're like,

14:02.113 --> 14:03.479
"Hey, I'm gonna get me
one of those."

14:03.512 --> 14:05.109
No, you're not,
motherfucker. No.

14:05.149 --> 14:06.748
One, because
you can't afford it

14:06.781 --> 14:08.547
and, two, because you haven't
fucking earned it.

14:08.580 --> 14:10.250
- Got it?
- I wasn't talking about getting one right now.

14:10.283 --> 14:12.912
I just meant like, eventually it
would be cool to like, go buy one.

14:12.953 --> 14:16.548
No, but you shouldn't even be
thinking about jet packs, Kenny.

14:16.581 --> 14:18.984
OK? You're not there yet.

14:19.017 --> 14:20.847
And this Kenny cutting in shit,

14:20.880 --> 14:22.247
that's gotta go, OK?

14:22.280 --> 14:24.285
Those one-on-ones,
that's my shit.

14:24.318 --> 14:26.178
That's my domain, got it?

14:26.219 --> 14:27.552
People seem to like the
"Kenny's cutting in."

14:27.585 --> 14:28.879
Oh, God.
Kenny, fucking A, man.

14:28.920 --> 14:31.553
Listen to what I'm saying.
All right?

14:31.586 --> 14:34.023
Everything we do, we do
for the best of the show.

14:34.056 --> 14:36.116
- And for you.
- Yeah, and for me.

14:36.156 --> 14:37.482
Motherfucker.
Yeah, that's right.

14:37.587 --> 14:39.322
Because I'm the star
of the show. Not you, me.

14:39.355 --> 14:43.060
I'm the fucking star.
OK?

14:43.092 --> 14:45.330
- Yeah, OK. I got it.
- You cool with that?

14:45.363 --> 14:48.557
Yeah, you're the main star
of the show.

14:48.590 --> 14:50.259
OK.

14:50.325 --> 14:53.166
Just remember, Kenny...

14:53.200 --> 14:56.705
...not everybody can fly,
buddy.

14:56.770 --> 15:08.010
Not everybody can fly.

15:08.043 --> 15:14.375
<i>[screams]</i>

15:14.416 --> 15:19.320
- [robot footsteps]
- <i>[robot] See ya.</i>

15:19.353 --> 15:28.930
Don't stay out too late, dude.

15:28.963 --> 15:31.559
Now, Kenny. I've been doing
a lot of thinking.

15:31.599 --> 15:33.230
You know how you said we don't
wanna be fucking Pinkberry?

15:33.263 --> 15:35.063
- Mm-hmm.
- Well, what do you think

15:35.103 --> 15:37.903
about starting with something
along the lines of...

15:37.936 --> 15:41.177
Boom! That kiosk right there.

15:41.210 --> 15:43.610
Check it out.
This is how it's gonna work.

15:43.643 --> 15:46.085
First, we'll get people's
attention with how hot

15:46.118 --> 15:48.316
and how banging
our waitresses are, right?

15:48.349 --> 15:51.218
And then, when they walk over,
they're gonna smell those

15:51.251 --> 15:53.123
baked potatoes cooking
in the microwave

15:53.156 --> 15:54.788
and ka-ching!

15:54.829 --> 15:57.093
We're making money, money,
money, money, money.

15:57.126 --> 15:59.429
No diggity, no doubt.
I like to bag it up.

15:59.502 --> 16:02.870
This is fucking wonderful, homes. I'm
loving how you sexualized the food.

16:02.935 --> 16:04.272
This is perfect
for a shopping mall.

16:04.305 --> 16:05.545
It's very sexy.

16:05.578 --> 16:07.742
The only thing I'm seeing
I'd like to put an amend on,

16:07.775 --> 16:10.110
perhaps a little more room
here for the fixins.

16:10.143 --> 16:11.311
You know what
I'm talking about?

16:11.376 --> 16:13.680
Ooh. We're gonna have
a lot of fixins?

16:13.713 --> 16:16.354
Dude, we're gonna have so many fucking
fixins up in this motherfucker.

16:16.387 --> 16:19.554
We call the sauce station
the sauce rack.

16:19.587 --> 16:21.362
- Ooh!
- Get it? Goes with the tit theme.

16:21.395 --> 16:23.059
- Oh yeah.
- So every single sauce

16:23.093 --> 16:25.366
needs to have a
double entendre sexual name.

16:25.399 --> 16:27.400
- Do you understand?
- Instead of bacon bits, bacon tits.

16:27.441 --> 16:29.672
- Ooh. That's fucking good. Hell yeah.
- Yeah.

16:29.705 --> 16:31.303
This shit's gonna go
through the roof, man.

16:31.344 --> 16:33.540
Goddamn, I'm shitting
gold these days.

16:33.573 --> 16:35.573
Kinda makes me wonder
why the hell so many people

16:35.614 --> 16:37.076
are trying to tell me
to slow down.

16:37.109 --> 16:38.444
Seems like motherfuckers
should be

16:38.477 --> 16:40.413
shutting the hell up
and enjoying the show.

16:40.446 --> 16:43.087
Who the fuck is trying to
tell you to fucking slow down?!

16:43.120 --> 16:46.192
- Guy Young, for one. Yeah.
- Oh.

16:46.225 --> 16:47.888
Telling me I'm becoming
too popular too quick.

16:47.929 --> 16:49.262
I need to lower my energy.

16:49.299 --> 16:52.097
I mean, goddamn, dude.
I'm reaching my potential.

16:52.130 --> 16:55.000
The audience loves me and now he wants
me to adhere to his leadership?

16:55.033 --> 16:56.570
I ain't trying
to hear that, see?

16:56.603 --> 16:59.111
Well, Kenny, we got a
good thing going here, right?

16:59.144 --> 17:02.217
I finally got the respect
of my wife and kids.

17:02.250 --> 17:03.953
You have a fucking pool.

17:03.985 --> 17:05.951
Guy Young, he's been
in this business a long time.

17:05.983 --> 17:08.782
So maybe you should just,
you know,

17:08.823 --> 17:10.624
follow his lead
and listen to him.

17:10.656 --> 17:12.627
Nah. He ain't trying to think
about what the audiences want.

17:12.660 --> 17:15.329
Homeboy's scared. He senses
my dangerous potential.

17:15.363 --> 17:16.992
Trying to confine me
to the Scottie Pippen role.

17:17.032 --> 17:18.198
I don't know about that.

17:18.231 --> 17:20.111
I mean, I've been Scottie Pippen
for a while now

17:20.135 --> 17:22.030
and it's pretty awesome.
I mean,

17:22.063 --> 17:25.238
plenty of pussy and cash
for nasty old Scottie Pippen.

17:25.271 --> 17:28.670
Well, that might be all right for
you but I was born to fly, dog.

17:28.703 --> 17:32.680
Michael Jordan. Air Jordan's.
Air Max's. Number 24.

17:32.745 --> 17:41.718
[up tempo music]

17:41.751 --> 17:43.919
Woo!

17:43.992 --> 17:45.689
We are infinite!

17:45.730 --> 17:48.792
You looking for that mallet but
this ain't Red Lobster, sweetheart.

17:48.833 --> 17:51.400
They don't give you mallets in the
fucking expensive restaurants.

17:51.433 --> 17:54.266
- [laughs]
- I bet you love sucking on them crab legs

17:54.307 --> 17:57.111
as opposed to sucking on some
goddamn therapy too, huh?

17:57.144 --> 18:01.554
Spending money. Drinking
expensive cognac. Mmm.

18:01.587 --> 18:02.786
Go on, girl.
Get that white meat.

18:02.819 --> 18:05.459
Yeah. Keep it down.
Yeah, yeah.

18:05.492 --> 18:07.525
Swallow that load of gold,
baby.

18:07.558 --> 18:09.864
- Kenny, stop it.
- No, but seriously.

18:09.897 --> 18:11.971
You charmed?

18:12.004 --> 18:15.507
No? Not yet?
Well then.

18:15.540 --> 18:18.516
Maybe you ought to take
a look underneath your seat.

18:18.549 --> 18:23.090
[clicks tongue]
Go on.

18:23.122 --> 18:26.561
What?

18:26.594 --> 18:29.226
$3,000 Chanel purse.
Wa-pow.

18:29.266 --> 18:32.635
- Take a look inside.
- Oh my God.

18:32.668 --> 18:36.635
Kindle Paperwhite. Pre-loaded
with over 500 e-books.

18:36.668 --> 18:39.812
Including all of
Dean R. Koontz's novels.

18:39.845 --> 18:41.843
Take a look at that
side pocket. What's in there?

18:41.876 --> 18:43.811
$500. Ha-ha-ha.

18:43.844 --> 18:46.180
Whoa, hold on.
I think I gotta take a shit.

18:46.213 --> 18:48.486
[makes fart sound]
Oh. There's a hundred bucks.

18:48.519 --> 18:50.359
[laughs] Hey, what's that?

18:50.392 --> 18:51.760
- What?
- Something's behind your ear over here.

18:51.793 --> 18:54.125
[makes fart sound]
Hundred dollar bill.

18:54.157 --> 18:56.396
Damn, all this giving's
making me thirsty.

18:56.429 --> 18:58.326
Whoop! Look out.
Chump change.

18:58.399 --> 19:00.304
This is what I was afraid of.

19:00.337 --> 19:03.940
This is... right now what's
happening is my biggest fear.

19:03.973 --> 19:05.653
I feel like you're
not taking me seriously.

19:05.678 --> 19:08.444
I feel like you are getting
caught up in the bullshit.

19:08.477 --> 19:11.087
- You're not listening to me.
- OK, I'm listening.

19:11.120 --> 19:12.951
What the fuck do you want me to do?
[chuckles]

19:12.984 --> 19:15.186
I want to go to therapy.

19:15.219 --> 19:16.387
[sighs]
Oh. Jesus Christ.

19:16.420 --> 19:22.765
Please, can we go?
We need it.

19:22.830 --> 19:23.796
OK, fine. You know what?

19:23.829 --> 19:25.257
- You wanna go to therapy?
- Yes.

19:25.362 --> 19:26.897
Let's waste our money
on therapy. That's fine.

19:26.962 --> 19:27.962
Not because we can't afford it.

19:27.995 --> 19:29.796
'Cause trust me, sweetheart,
we can afford it.

19:29.805 --> 19:31.303
It's just, my motto's
always been,

19:31.336 --> 19:32.903
"Just 'cause you have money
you don't need to be wasting it

19:32.944 --> 19:34.638
on frivolous nonsense."

19:34.679 --> 19:37.174
But if my wife wants
fucking therapy, then,

19:37.215 --> 19:40.382
looks like we're going
to see a therapist.

19:40.415 --> 19:42.286
- Thank you.
- [sighs]

19:42.319 --> 19:44.579
Now then, can we please enjoy
this luxurious dinner?

19:44.613 --> 19:48.314
- Yeah, we can.
- Garçon.

19:48.355 --> 19:50.523
Finest bottle of
white zinfandel, please.

19:50.556 --> 20:05.935
[opera music]

20:09.202 --> 20:15.741
No. I'm OK.

20:15.774 --> 20:17.878
[whistles]
Bellissima.

20:17.943 --> 20:21.550
[Kenny clapping] Bravo!

20:21.615 --> 20:23.611
Fuck yeah. Bellissima.

20:23.652 --> 20:34.399
Bellissimas.

20:34.432 --> 20:36.352
[whispers] Isn't this the
picture of tranquility?

20:36.367 --> 20:38.030
[both chuckle]

20:38.063 --> 20:41.598
Billy. Trent. You guys
can take the children upstairs.

20:41.639 --> 20:43.536
You're relieved of your duties
for this evening.

20:43.577 --> 20:51.778
Thank you for your services.

20:51.811 --> 20:53.347
Good night.

20:53.380 --> 20:56.947
Pleasant dreams.

20:57.012 --> 20:59.581
You know, I'm kinda tired too.
So I'm gonna go to bed.

20:59.646 --> 21:02.277
But, um... I just wanna
thank you for tonight.

21:02.318 --> 21:05.421
Yeah.

21:05.454 --> 21:08.880
Good night.

21:08.913 --> 21:24.294
[sighs]

21:30.407 --> 21:34.207
Oh, stop everything, ladies.
You can't improve on perfection.

21:34.240 --> 21:36.110
- [laughs] Look at you.
- [Kenny] Hell yeah, that's right.

21:36.143 --> 21:37.973
- Good looking.
- Ah, man.

21:38.013 --> 21:41.144
Champion. You ready
to rock today's show?

21:41.209 --> 21:44.406
You know me, Guy. Always ready to bust
a nut on this television audience.

21:44.439 --> 21:46.881
OK. But remember what
we talked about? Right?

21:46.913 --> 21:49.184
Oh yeah. That's what I mean,
like, bust a nut,

21:49.249 --> 21:51.119
but, at the same time,
remember my place.

21:51.152 --> 21:53.780
That's right. So you're
usually about an eleven,

21:53.821 --> 21:56.049
we're gonna bring it down
to a five or a six, OK?

21:56.082 --> 21:59.845
All right. That's what you ask
for, that's what you're gonna get.

21:59.918 --> 22:04.222
Hey.
You're my favorite co-host.

22:04.255 --> 22:06.326
- Thank you.
- [Guy] Nice meeting you.

22:06.359 --> 22:10.793
Yeah.
Good to see you again.

22:10.826 --> 22:15.527
Some good advice, Kenny.
Five or a six.

22:15.592 --> 22:21.131
[sighs]

22:21.164 --> 22:24.028
- [audience cheering]
- Welcome back to another session of <i>Sports Sesh.</i>

22:24.069 --> 22:27.467
I'm Guy Young and I don't know how
I got talked into this segment.

22:27.500 --> 22:29.898
We're here with Jeff,
the animal expert.

22:29.939 --> 22:31.337
And we have a...
What do we have with us?

22:31.370 --> 22:33.569
It's called a black and white
ruffed lemur.

22:33.602 --> 22:35.809
You know those eyes remind me
of Rodney's ex-wife.

22:35.842 --> 22:37.440
- [audience laughs]
- Not cool.

22:37.473 --> 22:40.607
[Guy] Oh, we got another one
coming in. Great.

22:40.648 --> 22:42.088
And what is this?
This isn't a lemur.

22:42.144 --> 22:44.952
This is called an anteater.
A tamandua.

22:44.985 --> 22:46.878
They smell like weed
in an Italian restaurant.

22:46.919 --> 22:48.652
- [Guy] I see that.
- Get in there. Get right in there.

22:48.685 --> 22:50.714
- Get right...
- Ahh, I don't want it to bite me.

22:50.747 --> 22:52.955
I'm seeing so many missed joke
opportunities here.

22:52.988 --> 22:54.221
All right. Hey,
keep an eye on this thing.

22:54.254 --> 22:55.758
- I don't want it...
- I will. You're safe.

22:55.791 --> 22:57.292
- Oh, now who's this?
- I promise you. This is Bella.

22:57.325 --> 22:59.553
She's a white belly or
black handed spider monkey.

22:59.594 --> 23:01.592
- Is that right?
- Look, I bet he won't even say anything

23:01.657 --> 23:03.855
- about spanking the monkey.
- [Guy] Mischievous, these monkeys?

23:03.895 --> 23:05.793
[Jeff] Oh yeah. You gotta keep your eye on these guys.
They'll steal your jewelry.

23:05.833 --> 23:08.926
- And when they do that do you ever spank the monkey?
- [audience laughs]

23:08.967 --> 23:11.131
All right. Well, OK.
That was kind of obvious.

23:11.164 --> 23:13.835
- He got that one.
- Would you let me feed Bella? Is that OK?

23:13.868 --> 23:16.668
No. She doesn't take food
from strangers. No.

23:16.701 --> 23:18.036
We do... we teach her the
whole "stranger danger"...

23:18.069 --> 23:19.603
[voices muffled] I see, I see.
Well, that's probably safer

23:19.636 --> 23:29.803
- for both parties.
- Sure.

23:29.843 --> 23:31.041
Fuck this.

23:31.074 --> 23:33.747
I think it's time to stop
monkeying around.

23:33.780 --> 23:35.145
- Kenny's cutting in.
- [bell dings]

23:35.178 --> 23:40.747
- <i>[Sports Sesh</i> theme music]
- [cheering]

23:40.780 --> 23:42.876
No, that's all right, Ken. We're
good over here. We're cool.

23:42.917 --> 23:45.251
- We're good. Sit back down.
- [laughs] Cutting in.

23:45.284 --> 23:47.983
Guy, let me take this.
If there's one thing I know,

23:48.017 --> 23:51.284
- it's monkey business.
- [audience laughs]

23:51.317 --> 23:52.149
Oh yeah. Is that right?

23:52.182 --> 23:53.782
Do you have a
special relationship

23:53.823 --> 23:56.419
- with monkeys, do you?
- Well, you know I got people in Atlanta.

23:56.452 --> 23:59.122
[laughter]

23:59.155 --> 24:01.355
And they all love Skittles,
red Kool-Aid

24:01.388 --> 24:03.828
and some of them even like...
Froot Loops.

24:03.861 --> 24:06.659
That's right.
Bella, you like Froot Loops?

24:06.700 --> 24:09.393
Oooh. There we go. Huh.

24:09.434 --> 24:13.468
- Oh. Wonderful.
- [all] Aww.

24:13.501 --> 24:15.268
Wonderful.

24:15.309 --> 24:17.769
I think Bella and me are making
a little connection here, huh?

24:17.802 --> 24:20.073
Ooh, I found me
a date to the prom.

24:20.107 --> 24:22.242
Oh yeah.
Put on some Jodeci.

24:22.315 --> 24:25.743
Let's slow dance, Bella.
What you say? What you say?

24:25.776 --> 24:32.581

24:32.614 --> 24:35.516
