00:00.300 --> 00:01.349
Previously on "Heartland"...

00:01.495 --> 00:02.502
You know,
I've got this new case; Luke.

00:02.602 --> 00:05.807
I just thought a couple of
days around horses on a ranch

00:05.860 --> 00:07.341
might put him in a better head-space.

00:07.441 --> 00:09.041
Oh hey! Whoa! Whoa!

00:09.142 --> 00:11.544
Since when did you start gettin'
your mail sent here?

00:11.645 --> 00:14.447
Oh, just until I know what
my living arrangements

00:14.548 --> 00:16.382
are gonna be, just don't worry about it.

00:16.483 --> 00:18.484
Are you the Georgie Fleming-Morris?

00:18.585 --> 00:19.919
I wanna be your friend.

00:20.020 --> 00:22.455
Well, good, 'cause I...
wanna be your friend, too.

00:22.556 --> 00:24.256
Look at the little birdhouse!

00:24.358 --> 00:26.759
All thanks to Luke right here.

00:26.860 --> 00:28.494
Oof! I have a concussion.

00:28.595 --> 00:30.429
The doctor said I have to
take it easy for a while.

01:24.751 --> 01:25.951
Morning, Luke.

01:31.992 --> 01:33.893
Seatbelt.

01:33.994 --> 01:36.162
Hey, your mom leave for work already?

01:36.263 --> 01:38.130
Yeah.

01:56.917 --> 01:58.651
Hi, Daddy!

01:58.752 --> 02:01.687
Yay!

02:01.788 --> 02:04.457
- Funny!
- Funny!

02:05.559 --> 02:07.460
- Hey! Did you get it?
- Hey!

02:07.561 --> 02:10.196
- Yes, I did, right here.
- Oh!

02:10.297 --> 02:12.231
And the clerk said they
got great feedback on it.

02:12.332 --> 02:14.700
And it has this feature where it like,

02:14.801 --> 02:16.502
cheers when she has a success.

02:16.603 --> 02:18.838
Interesting, I still think we're crazy

02:18.939 --> 02:21.140
trying to potty train our
daughter in one weekend.

02:21.241 --> 02:22.875
Well,
the book said it only takes three days.

02:22.976 --> 02:24.944
Yeah, but I mean,
that's a lot of pressure

02:25.045 --> 02:26.512
to put on a toddler.

02:26.613 --> 02:28.948
We got the entire weekend off,
no distractions.

02:29.049 --> 02:30.416
Lyndy can do this!

02:30.517 --> 02:32.284
- Can you do this?
- I know she can!

02:32.385 --> 02:33.486
I told you, I've seen the signs.

02:33.587 --> 02:35.354
Yeah, "the signs", you've said.

02:35.455 --> 02:37.757
She's totally ready.

02:37.858 --> 02:39.725
Hey, is Luke coming today?

02:39.826 --> 02:41.694
No, that's next weekend.

02:41.795 --> 02:43.529
You're sure?

02:43.630 --> 02:45.397
Yeah, I think so, I...

02:47.467 --> 02:48.968
it's today! Uh...

02:49.069 --> 02:50.636
What about potty training?

02:50.737 --> 02:52.705
I, well...
I guess we'll have to double down,

02:52.806 --> 02:55.374
- and hope she's a quick study.
- Okay.

02:55.475 --> 02:58.711
- Sorry about that.
- Hey, do you wanna meet Clint?

03:03.216 --> 03:04.416
- Hey, there!
- Hey.

03:04.518 --> 03:06.218
Lyndy, finally!

03:07.387 --> 03:09.321
Hey, sweetie!

03:09.422 --> 03:11.557
- Whoa, is everything okay?
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

03:11.658 --> 03:13.893
I, I got the dates mixed up, but...

03:13.994 --> 03:16.262
- Is this gonna be a problem?
- No, it's... it's fine.

03:16.363 --> 03:19.265
- Okay.
- Hey, Luke.

03:19.366 --> 03:20.900
Welcome back.

03:21.001 --> 03:24.054
Why don't you put
your stuff in the office?

03:25.105 --> 03:27.473
That's great because
I need a few hours to,

03:27.574 --> 03:29.542
to find Luke a place
to stay this weekend.

03:29.643 --> 03:31.010
What do you mean?

03:31.111 --> 03:33.012
Oh, his mom picked up some extra shifts,

03:33.113 --> 03:34.914
and she doesn't have childcare,

03:35.015 --> 03:37.082
so I'm scrambling to find him a place.

03:37.184 --> 03:40.419
Uh... you know, he could,
he could just stay here.

03:40.520 --> 03:42.021
Really? I mean, that would be great,

03:42.122 --> 03:44.023
that would be a huge help.

03:44.124 --> 03:45.958
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, yeah.

03:46.059 --> 03:49.461
We'll make it work, that'd be fine.

03:49.563 --> 03:51.730
Hey... it'll be fine.

03:57.367 --> 04:01.494

04:36.710 --> 04:38.510
Oh hey, look at this.
A bona-fide Georgie sighting!

04:38.612 --> 04:40.045
What does that mean?

04:40.146 --> 04:42.715
It means I don't, I feel like
I don't see you anymore, ever.

04:42.816 --> 04:44.149
Okay, well, with work and training,

04:44.251 --> 04:46.085
I've barely had time for anything.

04:46.186 --> 04:48.854
Yeah, well,
it's my duty as a friend to tell you

04:48.955 --> 04:52.558
that you are actually in danger
of becoming capital "B" boring.

04:52.659 --> 04:54.560
Wow, thanks.

04:54.661 --> 04:58.230
Yeah, you're welcome.
It's my duty, so... I do it.

04:58.331 --> 05:00.866
Um, there's actually a
retrospective on Godzilla

05:00.967 --> 05:03.369
playing this weekend,
Adam said it was epic.

05:03.470 --> 05:06.238
So, do you wanna go?

05:06.339 --> 05:08.974
What like, a date?

05:09.075 --> 05:11.844
No, like a friend. Like, a friend date.

05:13.613 --> 05:15.414
What?

05:15.515 --> 05:17.850
Th-that-that's Betty Thomas!

05:17.951 --> 05:19.184
- Who?
- Betty Thomas!

05:19.286 --> 05:20.686
The lady who just sat down!

05:20.787 --> 05:22.321
I don't know, who is that?

05:22.422 --> 05:23.722
She's a famous trick rider!

05:26.126 --> 05:27.993
Excuse me?

05:28.094 --> 05:30.930
Hi,
I don't mean to disturb you or anything,

05:31.031 --> 05:32.364
but you're Betty Thomas, right?

05:32.465 --> 05:36.201
- Hey! Watch it!
- Oh my goodness, I'm so sorry!

05:36.303 --> 05:38.737
Sorry, I'm just,
I'm a really big fan of yours,

05:38.838 --> 05:41.774
and I-I just can't believe it's you!

05:41.875 --> 05:43.542
My coach used to show
me tons of your videos.

05:43.643 --> 05:45.277
I just think you're absolutely amazing,
I...

05:45.378 --> 05:47.146
Guess what?
I don't really care what you think,

05:47.247 --> 05:50.215
I just want some food,
if that's not too much to ask.

05:50.317 --> 05:53.919
Uh yeah, okay. What can I get you?

05:54.020 --> 05:56.021
Green salad, dressing on the side.

05:56.122 --> 05:58.257
- And make it quick.
- Okay.

05:59.359 --> 06:01.694
Coming right up.

06:04.798 --> 06:07.499
Whoa, What is her deal?

06:09.469 --> 06:13.238
Hey, Lis. Yeah,
your package arrived safe and sound.

06:13.340 --> 06:15.607
And yes, I agree,

06:15.709 --> 06:18.944
we'll be saving this for our
anniversary, I can't wait.

06:19.045 --> 06:21.280
Love you lots, call me.

06:21.381 --> 06:23.415
Nope, non-negotiable, Jade.

06:23.516 --> 06:26.151
No! A ride?!

06:27.187 --> 06:28.988
I'll tell you what,
Jack'll swing by and pick you up.

06:29.089 --> 06:30.990
I'll talk to you later, bye.

06:31.091 --> 06:32.791
You can't just assume

06:32.892 --> 06:34.793
I'm free to do your running around.

06:34.894 --> 06:37.129
One of the benefits of having me around

06:37.230 --> 06:39.932
is that you've got a lot
more free time on your hands.

06:40.033 --> 06:42.501
Besides,
I know that Jade is just moping around

06:42.602 --> 06:44.336
her mother's house, right?

06:44.437 --> 06:46.405
She refuses to get involved
with the rodeo school,

06:46.506 --> 06:47.973
but she's gotta get out of this funk,

06:48.074 --> 06:49.775
she's gotta find something to do.

06:49.876 --> 06:51.643
What is all that?

06:51.745 --> 06:54.947
Oh, I am making cedar planked salmon

06:56.182 --> 06:57.549
tonight for dinner.

06:57.650 --> 06:59.618
I told you,
I was making my stew tonight.

06:59.719 --> 07:01.820
Yeah well,
people are getting a little tired

07:01.921 --> 07:04.323
of your greasy old stew, Jack.

07:04.424 --> 07:07.026
I mean, even that vegetarian
meal that Lou whipped up

07:07.127 --> 07:08.827
the other night for Maya,

07:08.928 --> 07:10.229
that was like a refreshing relief

07:10.330 --> 07:12.097
from some of your old recipes, okay?

07:12.198 --> 07:14.566
You gotta, you gotta be
open to new things, like me.

07:14.667 --> 07:17.336
Okay well, maybe you could
be open to putting new hinges

07:17.437 --> 07:19.304
on the gate to the back road?!

07:19.406 --> 07:21.206
Here we go, I told you I'd do that!

07:21.307 --> 07:23.108
Well,
you've been saying that for a week.

07:23.209 --> 07:24.977
- Well, I'll do it right now!
- Okay!

07:25.078 --> 07:27.112
- You pick up Jade.
- Why can't you pick her up?

07:27.213 --> 07:29.248
Because I gotta fix the hinges!

07:29.349 --> 07:32.117
And make cedar planked
salmon for dinner.

07:34.254 --> 07:35.888
Works for me.

07:37.657 --> 07:39.525
I don't get it.

07:39.626 --> 07:41.660
I was trying to tell
her how amazing she was,

07:41.761 --> 07:44.263
and... she was so mean.

07:44.364 --> 07:46.799
Yeah well, that's...
Maybe that's why they say

07:46.900 --> 07:49.001
you shouldn't meet your heroes.

07:49.102 --> 07:51.236
I don't know,
I just don't want to have to deal

07:51.337 --> 07:54.139
- with her right now.
- Okay. Okay, I'll do it.

07:54.240 --> 07:56.141
- What?
- I got it, I got it.

07:56.242 --> 07:58.343
Trust me, I'm gonna win her over.

07:58.445 --> 08:00.012
- Really?
- Yeah.

08:00.113 --> 08:01.680
Old ladies love me.

08:05.185 --> 08:08.153
Hi, here you go, that's for you.

08:08.254 --> 08:10.022
So is that.

08:10.123 --> 08:12.724
Betty, right? My name's Wyatt.

08:12.826 --> 08:15.694
- My Mom's the manager here.
- So?

08:15.795 --> 08:17.563
So I just wanted to come over,

08:17.664 --> 08:19.264
and I wanted to introduce myself,

08:19.365 --> 08:21.967
- and just say hi.
- Why?

08:22.068 --> 08:23.936
Beuse my friend, Georgie, over there,

08:24.037 --> 08:25.537
who you met already,

08:25.638 --> 08:27.739
is actually super inspired by you, uh...

08:27.841 --> 08:29.842
and she used to be like,
an amazing trick rider too.

08:29.943 --> 08:32.711
Uh, Georgie, come here?
Yeah, come here, come here!

08:32.812 --> 08:34.780
Hey, you guys are gonna love each other,

08:34.881 --> 08:36.914
you're gonna get along really well,
so...

08:37.015 --> 08:39.017
I was just telling Betty
how you used to trick ride.

08:39.119 --> 08:41.854
I haven't done any trick riding...

08:41.955 --> 08:44.323
in a long time.

08:44.424 --> 08:46.525
Not that it's any of your business.

08:46.626 --> 08:49.061
What is it with this place?!

08:49.162 --> 08:51.263
Can't I just eat in peace?

08:51.364 --> 08:53.065
Sorry...

09:01.174 --> 09:02.541
Whoops.

09:05.712 --> 09:07.312
Wow.

09:12.719 --> 09:15.654
Hey, thank you so much
for looking after Lyndy.

09:15.755 --> 09:18.423
It turns out,
Luke is staying for the whole weekend.

09:18.525 --> 09:20.592
- Overnight?
- Yeah.

09:20.693 --> 09:23.128
We weren't exactly prepared for that.

09:24.430 --> 09:26.765
Hey, how was your shift?

09:26.866 --> 09:29.234
Hey, you will not believe
who came in to the diner.

09:29.335 --> 09:31.970
Betty Thomas.
She's like this famous trick rider.

09:32.071 --> 09:34.606
You bet she was! How is she doing?

09:34.707 --> 09:35.908
You know her?

09:36.009 --> 09:38.243
Oh, sure. I saw Betty perform at lots

09:38.344 --> 09:40.979
of half-time shows,
she was the real deal, boy.

09:41.080 --> 09:43.248
Yeah, I saw her, and her horse, Boots.

09:43.349 --> 09:45.184
They were incredible.

09:45.285 --> 09:48.120
Yeah, maybe,
but she was pretty rude to me.

09:49.556 --> 09:52.357
Well, Betty's had a rough go.

09:53.726 --> 09:55.060
You know, her and her husband, Frank,

09:55.161 --> 09:56.995
they fell on some hard times,

09:57.096 --> 09:59.698
They had to sell out lock,
stock, and barrel,

09:59.799 --> 10:03.168
and then things just
went downhill from there.

10:03.269 --> 10:04.970
What do you mean?

10:05.071 --> 10:06.872
Well, Frank passed away.

10:06.973 --> 10:09.408
It must be goin' on two years by now,

10:09.509 --> 10:12.711
and Betty's life fell apart.

10:12.812 --> 10:14.646
No one's seen much of her at all,
lately.

10:17.650 --> 10:19.218
That's crazy, what trick is that?

10:19.319 --> 10:20.419
It's called a shoulder stand,

10:20.520 --> 10:22.621
it's actually really hard.

10:22.722 --> 10:24.756
What uh, what's the article say?

10:24.857 --> 10:27.159
Well, it turns out the horse
that actually made Betty famous

10:27.260 --> 10:30.028
- was Boots' Mom, Lightning.
- Oh.

10:32.398 --> 10:33.665
What? What's wrong?

10:35.969 --> 10:39.438
It's her husband's obituary.
Frank Thomas.

10:39.539 --> 10:42.007
He was killed in a car accident.

10:42.108 --> 10:44.843
Oh, that's uh, that's terrible.

10:44.944 --> 10:47.012
Yeah.

10:47.113 --> 10:48.580
It says here that she was forced

10:48.681 --> 10:50.649
to put Boots up for auction.

10:54.287 --> 10:56.455
I can't imagine.

10:59.425 --> 11:01.593
What if we were to...

11:01.694 --> 11:04.129
track Boots down?

11:04.230 --> 11:05.797
So they could see each other again.

11:05.898 --> 11:07.232
Do you have time to do that?

11:07.333 --> 11:09.134
I mean, what about like, your training?

11:09.235 --> 11:10.869
I'll make time.

11:10.970 --> 11:13.739
Oh! Oh, okay, so should I be
offended that you don't have

11:13.840 --> 11:14.940
time to see a movie with me,

11:15.041 --> 11:16.808
but you're gonna make time to track down

11:16.909 --> 11:19.811
some random rude stranger's horse?!

11:19.912 --> 11:22.347
No, it's just...

11:22.448 --> 11:26.262
I get it, no wonder she's so...
miserable.

11:26.686 --> 11:28.553
Maybe we can help her.

11:28.655 --> 11:31.857
Okay, I can't really say no to that,
can I?

11:57.617 --> 11:59.618
All right!

11:59.719 --> 12:01.820
Well, we're inoculating the horses,

12:01.921 --> 12:03.488
I thought you might like to help.

12:05.825 --> 12:07.959
What are they being vaccinated for?

12:08.061 --> 12:10.062
Well, horses are susceptible
to many of the same diseases

12:10.163 --> 12:12.864
as humans are. Rabies,
tetanus, west nile.

12:12.965 --> 12:15.100
All right. You ready?

12:15.201 --> 12:17.235
Yeah. Let's go, Luke.

12:21.607 --> 12:23.642
Okay.

12:29.916 --> 12:32.217
All right, I think he's ready.

12:38.591 --> 12:41.126
- Whoa, easy.
- It's okay.

12:41.227 --> 12:43.562
Amy's got him.
You don't have to be scared.

12:43.663 --> 12:46.331
I'm not scared!

12:46.432 --> 12:47.833
I know it's tough;
you didn't expect to spend

12:47.934 --> 12:49.634
the whole weekend at Heartland.

12:49.736 --> 12:51.870
But we're glad that you're here, okay?

12:51.971 --> 12:54.906
I'm only here because
my mom got a new job!

12:55.007 --> 12:56.441
All right.

12:56.542 --> 12:58.877
What do you normally do
when your mom's at work?

12:58.978 --> 13:01.346
It's not like she
likes leaving me alone!

13:01.447 --> 13:03.315
I didn't say that she does.

13:03.416 --> 13:05.350
Okay,
but she does leave you alone sometimes,

13:05.451 --> 13:07.552
when she goes to work, doesn't she?

13:10.016 --> 13:11.323
Luke?

13:17.096 --> 13:19.464
Okay well, thanks anyway.

13:19.565 --> 13:20.599
Yeah, okay.

13:20.700 --> 13:22.234
Bye.

13:22.335 --> 13:24.035
Wow, who knew this was gonna be so hard?

13:24.137 --> 13:25.670
I know, right?

13:25.772 --> 13:26.772
What's next?

13:33.613 --> 13:35.514
Okay, thanks.

13:35.615 --> 13:38.150
- So?
- Nope.

13:40.520 --> 13:41.920
Hey, look.

13:42.021 --> 13:44.022
Boots got a new owner.

13:46.058 --> 13:47.559
Great, thank you.

13:47.660 --> 13:49.761
Yeah, we'll be right there!

13:49.862 --> 13:52.164
Okay, bye. Yes, we got him!

13:52.265 --> 13:55.367
- Oh, good! All right!
- Yeah!

13:55.468 --> 13:57.636
Georgie? Hi, I'm Philip.

13:57.737 --> 13:59.905
We spoke on the phone.
I manage the place.

14:00.006 --> 14:02.641
Nice to meet you, this is my...
friend, Wyatt.

14:02.742 --> 14:04.209
Hey.

14:04.310 --> 14:05.777
So this is Boots, right?

14:05.878 --> 14:08.613
- Yep.
- Can I go see him?

14:08.714 --> 14:11.550
You can try.

14:14.287 --> 14:16.288
Hey, bud.

14:18.658 --> 14:20.425
Hey.

14:26.032 --> 14:28.400
He wasn't always like this.

14:28.501 --> 14:29.401
Well, what happened?

14:29.502 --> 14:31.069
Boots' owner pays for his upkeep,

14:31.170 --> 14:33.438
but he lives in another province.

14:33.539 --> 14:37.075
It's been a year since
he's been down to visit.

14:37.176 --> 14:39.010
I do what I can, but...

14:39.111 --> 14:42.013
it's getting harder
and harder to ride him.

14:42.114 --> 14:44.349
Do you think I could take
him to Heartland for a day?

14:44.450 --> 14:46.551
Horses only leave here
with their owners.

14:46.652 --> 14:47.953
But his owner isn't around,

14:48.054 --> 14:52.424
and I really think it would be in Boots'
best interest.

14:52.525 --> 14:53.992
Could you maybe...

14:54.093 --> 14:56.895
- call the owners, to ask?
- Just say yes, trust me.

14:56.996 --> 14:59.164
When it comes to Georgie,
"resistance is futile."

15:02.902 --> 15:05.136
Yeah, okay, I'll call.

15:05.238 --> 15:07.105
- It can't hurt, right?
- Yeah, thank you, thanks.

15:07.206 --> 15:09.441
Thank you.

15:10.743 --> 15:13.445
Whoa!

15:13.546 --> 15:15.580
Honey, leave poor Remy alone.

15:19.285 --> 15:21.820
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful.

15:25.291 --> 15:28.059
Okay. Hey, Jade, perfect timing.

15:28.160 --> 15:30.195
I need somebody to make a marinade.

15:30.296 --> 15:31.730
Okay,
since when do you invite somebody over,

15:31.831 --> 15:33.698
and ask them to help you with dinner?

15:33.799 --> 15:36.368
- Since I'm behind schedule.
- Sorry, I'll be on the sofa.

15:36.469 --> 15:38.370
- Wha... uppy her!
- Uppy! Up!

15:38.471 --> 15:40.805
Uppy her, you gotta keep her occupied.

15:40.907 --> 15:43.475
I...

15:43.576 --> 15:45.510
Wait.

15:45.611 --> 15:48.046
Jack, I need you to pitch in.

15:48.147 --> 15:50.048
Oh no, I wouldn't dream of interfering

15:50.149 --> 15:51.850
with your special dinner.

15:52.852 --> 15:54.319
Okay, great, thank you!

15:54.420 --> 15:57.088
Yeah, I'll see you tomorrow. Bye-bye.

15:57.189 --> 16:00.392
Okay!
Boots can come to Heartland tomorrow.

16:00.493 --> 16:03.094
Well, that, that's great, but why?

16:03.195 --> 16:05.330
So Betty can see him again.

16:05.431 --> 16:07.432
That is, if she wants to,
you don't know that.

16:07.533 --> 16:09.634
I'm sure she will.

16:09.735 --> 16:11.870
Do you think you could meet
me at the stable tomorrow

16:11.971 --> 16:14.005
to pick him up, and maybe...

16:14.106 --> 16:15.974
work with him while he's here?

16:16.075 --> 16:18.643
Well, I would love to,
and I'll do my best,

16:18.744 --> 16:20.245
but Ty's busy all day,

16:20.346 --> 16:22.414
and I've got Lyndy.

16:22.515 --> 16:24.349
Jade can look after Lyndy.

16:24.450 --> 16:26.084
- What? No I can't.
- Why?

16:26.185 --> 16:28.787
Well-well, I'm sure you've
got lots of stuff to do, so...

16:28.888 --> 16:30.255
Yeah.

16:30.356 --> 16:33.325
What? What do you have to do tomorrow?

16:33.426 --> 16:35.360
Well... actually, nothing.

16:35.461 --> 16:37.028
Right, see?

16:37.129 --> 16:38.330
Uh well, I don't know, we...

16:38.431 --> 16:39.898
I think that would really help us out.

16:39.999 --> 16:42.667
I mean, if you're,
if you're up for it, I...

16:42.768 --> 16:44.369
Right? It would be great.

16:44.470 --> 16:46.905
- Well, I guess.
- Perfect.

16:48.441 --> 16:50.508
Luke, not at the table.

16:51.510 --> 16:54.479
- Sorry.
- Hey.

16:56.649 --> 16:59.618
You know the treehouse,
I rode past there yesterday,

16:59.719 --> 17:02.721
and it looks like a nice little family

17:02.822 --> 17:05.790
has already settled into
that birdhouse you built.

17:07.226 --> 17:09.260
Dad, this salmon is amazing.

17:09.362 --> 17:11.396
- It is delicious.
- Right, huh?

17:11.497 --> 17:13.498
And it's good for your heart.
It's a lot better than that

17:13.598 --> 17:15.599
greasy stew we get all the time.

17:17.703 --> 17:20.571
Did you have to dirty
every dish in this house?

17:22.174 --> 17:24.075
What can I say?
The salmon was a big hit.

17:24.175 --> 17:25.910
It's a small price to pay.

17:34.020 --> 17:36.154
What? I didn't drink that.

17:36.255 --> 17:38.390
I used it to soak the planks.

17:38.491 --> 17:40.191
You what?!

17:40.292 --> 17:41.860
I'll replace it, no big deal.

17:41.961 --> 17:43.962
You can't replace it!

17:44.063 --> 17:46.498
Lisa just sent this to me from France.

17:46.599 --> 17:49.801
It's a special vintage we were
saving for our anniversary!

17:49.902 --> 17:51.970
Well, I'm sorry. I had no idea.

17:52.071 --> 17:55.340
Yeah, 'cause you didn't ask,
you just helped yourself!

17:55.441 --> 17:57.175
You're gettin'
way too comfortable in this house

17:57.276 --> 17:59.944
for my liking, you're sticking
your oar where it's not wanted!

18:00.046 --> 18:01.880
You told me this was only temporary,

18:01.981 --> 18:03.581
so why are you still living here?

18:03.683 --> 18:05.016
Are you serious right now?!

18:05.117 --> 18:06.751
You know, I,
I've done everything I can do

18:06.852 --> 18:08.219
to help out around here, to pitch in.

18:08.320 --> 18:09.954
I made a big sacrifice moving in here!

18:10.056 --> 18:12.457
You're here because you
made a foolhardy decision.

18:12.558 --> 18:15.193
You sold Big River,
but I'm the one who's paying the price!

18:15.294 --> 18:17.662
You're not-you're not gonna do this.
You're in a mood

18:17.763 --> 18:19.898
'cause you're missing Lisa.
Everybody knows it.

18:19.999 --> 18:21.800
You're just too stubborn to admit it.

18:21.901 --> 18:23.568
You're not blaming this on me, Jack!

18:23.669 --> 18:24.836
You have overstayed your welcome,

18:24.937 --> 18:27.539
and I want you out of my house.

18:33.345 --> 18:34.979
It's French.

18:51.263 --> 18:53.031
Hey, hey, hey.

18:54.266 --> 18:56.468
What are you doing?

18:56.569 --> 18:58.636
I can't reach my mom.

18:59.705 --> 19:01.206
Okay.

19:01.307 --> 19:03.074
Well, she's at work right now,
isn't she?

19:06.712 --> 19:08.947
Mom, are you okay?

19:24.581 --> 19:26.682
Her lunch is in the blue
container in the fridge here.

19:26.783 --> 19:29.551
Okay? And no treats, okay, Jade?

19:29.653 --> 19:30.853
Just the ones we have down here,

19:30.954 --> 19:32.488
They've got no added sugar
or anything like that.

19:32.589 --> 19:35.124
She can have one, but she'll
try to convince you otherwise.

19:35.225 --> 19:37.226
- All right?
- Got it.

19:37.327 --> 19:38.594
And don't let her out of your sight,

19:38.695 --> 19:40.129
she likes to get into everything.

19:40.230 --> 19:42.264
I mean, you've probably done
some babysitting before though,

19:42.365 --> 19:44.600
- right?
- No.

19:44.701 --> 19:46.235
No, kids aren't really my thing.

19:46.336 --> 19:48.170
But how hard could it be? I ride broncs.

19:48.271 --> 19:50.072
Or, at least, I used to.

19:50.173 --> 19:52.074
So I'm pretty sure I
can handle one toddler.

19:52.175 --> 19:54.543
Okay, well, just call, or text,

19:54.644 --> 19:56.712
shout, if anything comes up, okay?

19:56.813 --> 19:57.947
Okay.

19:58.048 --> 19:59.515
I'm gonna go down and meet Luke.

19:59.616 --> 20:01.350
Wait, what's all this stuff?

20:01.451 --> 20:03.485
Oh,
we were planning on potty training her

20:03.586 --> 20:04.887
this weekend,
but we're just putting that on hold,

20:04.988 --> 20:07.723
- so don't worry about it.
- Mmah!

20:07.824 --> 20:10.759
And is this gonna be cash,
or e-transfer?

20:10.860 --> 20:12.628
- Ah! Ah!
- Mhmm...

20:12.729 --> 20:14.863
You be good to Jade, okay, sweetheart?

20:14.965 --> 20:16.732
- Okay.
- 'Kay.

20:18.702 --> 20:20.436
Your daddy's a control freak.

20:20.537 --> 20:22.838
- Yeah.
- Yeah, he is!

20:22.939 --> 20:25.541
I pity your teenage years.

20:25.642 --> 20:27.409
- Yeah.
- Yeah!

20:28.511 --> 20:30.713
Are you sure you
called the right Betty Thomas?

20:30.814 --> 20:32.047
Yes, I'm sure, and I've gotta say,

20:32.148 --> 20:34.616
she was thrilled that I
found her credit card.

20:34.718 --> 20:37.252
She is eating out of my hand.

20:37.354 --> 20:38.988
So where's my credit card?

20:39.089 --> 20:40.789
Right here, there you go.

20:40.890 --> 20:43.092
Um, we just wanted to
talk to you for a second.

20:43.193 --> 20:44.760
I don't have time for this.

20:44.861 --> 20:46.328
You're gonna want to hear it, trust me.

20:46.429 --> 20:48.063
We have a surprise for you.

20:48.164 --> 20:50.499
- I hate surprises.
- We found Boots.

20:55.305 --> 20:57.673
What gives you the right to
go meddling in my business?

20:57.774 --> 20:59.675
We're sorry, we just found
out you had to give him up,

20:59.776 --> 21:02.077
so we thought you might
like to see him again.

21:02.178 --> 21:04.013
We're taking him to
Heartland later today.

21:04.114 --> 21:08.150
I-I can drive you this afternoon,
if you want.

21:08.251 --> 21:11.186
Why? Why would you do this?

21:12.889 --> 21:15.224
Well, when I think about
being forced to give up

21:15.325 --> 21:17.760
my horse, Phoenix, I...

21:17.861 --> 21:19.261
I can't even go there,

21:19.362 --> 21:21.497
but I know that if I did,

21:21.598 --> 21:24.733
I would take any chance I
could get to see him again.

21:26.403 --> 21:28.704
All right.

21:30.373 --> 21:31.974
Come on, bud.

21:32.075 --> 21:34.777
Come on.

21:36.546 --> 21:38.781
- There you go!
- Good!

21:38.882 --> 21:41.350
Good job, hey Georgie,
why don't you go put him

21:41.451 --> 21:42.985
in one of the pens, I'll be right there.

21:43.086 --> 21:44.486
Sure. Come on.

21:46.022 --> 21:48.690
Ugh...

21:48.792 --> 21:50.926
That's just Jade trying to be funny.

21:51.027 --> 21:52.661
Very funny.

21:56.966 --> 21:58.934
Hey uh, I'll be right back.

21:59.035 --> 22:00.502
Oh, okay.

22:01.905 --> 22:03.138
Come on.

22:03.239 --> 22:05.741
Hey, you goin' somewhere?

22:07.277 --> 22:08.977
Yep, I'm outta here.

22:09.079 --> 22:11.280
It's time to pull the plug
on this little experiment.

22:11.381 --> 22:13.282
Why?

22:13.383 --> 22:15.617
It was always
meant to be temporary.

22:15.718 --> 22:17.486
I can't live with Jack, he's impossible,

22:17.587 --> 22:19.721
he won't acknowledge
anything I do to help him.

22:19.823 --> 22:21.223
You know,
sometimes you've gotta give people

22:21.324 --> 22:23.759
a reason to stick around.

22:23.860 --> 22:25.828
Where you gonna go?

22:25.929 --> 22:27.963
I got a plan.

22:28.064 --> 22:30.966
I'm just really gonna miss
having you around here.

22:31.067 --> 22:34.336
Well,
I'm going to miss you, too,

22:34.437 --> 22:37.539
but I'm not gonna be that far,
I'll be close.

22:37.640 --> 22:39.741
- Okay.
- Okay.

22:39.843 --> 22:41.110
Okay...

22:47.217 --> 22:49.184
You wanna give it a shot, Luke?

22:49.285 --> 22:52.354
Yeah? All right.

22:52.455 --> 22:53.889
Put those in.

22:53.990 --> 22:55.691
Yeah, just like that.

22:55.792 --> 22:58.393
Now listen right here, okay?

23:00.463 --> 23:02.731
Can you hear it?

23:02.832 --> 23:05.367
Yeah. The sounds and rhythm
are similar to a human,

23:05.468 --> 23:07.202
but the rate's a bit slower.

23:07.303 --> 23:10.439
- Is that normal?
- Well, yeah.

23:10.540 --> 23:12.341
Boots is in good health.

23:14.144 --> 23:15.944
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

23:16.045 --> 23:18.080
So I got a message from Wyatt,

23:18.181 --> 23:19.915
he's bringing Betty over soon.

23:20.016 --> 23:22.584
Okay, well, I wannna check on
Jade before they get here, so...

23:22.685 --> 23:24.953
Well, I wanted to go and say hi anyway,
so I can go.

23:25.054 --> 23:26.822
Oh, okay...

23:26.923 --> 23:29.691
uh, actually um, you know,
I should probably go,

23:29.792 --> 23:32.928
uh, just...

23:33.029 --> 23:35.297
no, I'm gonna stay here.

23:35.398 --> 23:38.066
You can go, I'm good.

23:38.168 --> 23:39.434
- Okay.
- Yeah?

23:39.536 --> 23:41.637
- Yeah, I'm good.
- Yeah? Okay.

23:41.738 --> 23:43.438
Do you wanna brush Boots?

23:43.540 --> 23:45.107
I'll show you, you just go like this,

23:45.208 --> 23:47.109
along with the grain of the hair,

23:47.210 --> 23:50.579
just nice and smooth, wanna try?

23:50.680 --> 23:52.714
Ah...

23:52.815 --> 23:55.450
That's it.

24:05.562 --> 24:08.463
How's it goin' in there?

24:08.565 --> 24:10.933
Tents?

24:11.034 --> 24:12.568
Oh, wow!

24:13.603 --> 24:15.537
This is amazing!

24:15.638 --> 24:18.607
Mhmm. So, did Ty send you to spy on me?

24:18.708 --> 24:21.210
No, it's nothing like that.

24:21.311 --> 24:25.681
He did...
he did kinda wanna come check on you.

24:27.617 --> 24:29.985
So how's it going?

24:30.086 --> 24:31.753
It's good.

24:31.854 --> 24:35.123
Lyndy's a cute kid,
there's no doubt about that.

24:35.225 --> 24:37.993
And it's not like I have
anything better to do.

24:40.396 --> 24:42.331
Are you okay?

24:45.602 --> 24:50.134
I get it,
being sidelined with a concussion sucks.

24:52.942 --> 24:54.543
I haven't told anyone,

24:55.545 --> 24:57.679
but I have a follow-up
appointment tomorrow.

25:02.952 --> 25:05.254
What if I'm not getting any better?

25:05.355 --> 25:07.589
Do you want me to come
with you tomorrow?

25:07.690 --> 25:09.992
For moral support?

25:10.093 --> 25:11.493
Yeah.

25:12.495 --> 25:14.663
- Thank you.
- Jade.

25:15.765 --> 25:17.933
- Oh hey!
- What do you have?

25:18.034 --> 25:20.168
- This.
- Let's see. Cars?

25:26.109 --> 25:27.843
Okay...

25:30.346 --> 25:32.948
Good boy, Boots.

25:33.049 --> 25:35.150
You're fine.

25:35.251 --> 25:36.618
It's okay, hey, hey, hey. Whoa...

25:36.719 --> 25:39.421
- Hey, hey, easy, easy.
- Whoa...

25:39.522 --> 25:41.757
- You good?
- Yeah.

25:43.593 --> 25:45.260
Okay, come on.

25:45.361 --> 25:48.263
Come on, Boots, it's okay.

25:56.606 --> 25:58.373
You just wait.

26:03.713 --> 26:06.183
Boots!

26:14.390 --> 26:16.291
How are you, buddy?

26:16.392 --> 26:19.161
You look good!

26:27.303 --> 26:29.905
That's it, come on.

26:41.351 --> 26:43.452
You two wanna go for a ride?

26:43.553 --> 26:45.573
Yeah, sure!

27:00.407 --> 27:03.309
Hey Luke,
we'll be right out front, okay?

27:03.410 --> 27:05.678
What?! Oh...

27:08.949 --> 27:12.218
Hey. Ha! Ha! Power steps.

27:12.319 --> 27:14.820
Don't even need 'em.

27:14.921 --> 27:16.455
What do you think?

27:16.556 --> 27:18.157
Well, what's it for?

27:18.258 --> 27:20.759
Well, I got the idea from
your little family road trip.

27:20.861 --> 27:22.962
It's a house on wheels.

27:23.063 --> 27:25.164
- You're gonna live in this?
- Uh-huh.

27:25.265 --> 27:27.533
Huh. If-if that's what
makes you happy Dad,

27:27.634 --> 27:29.235
then I'm, I'm happy for you.

27:29.336 --> 27:30.836
Thank you, sweetheart.

27:30.937 --> 27:33.472
Amy uh, do you know where
Jade got this paint from?

27:33.573 --> 27:35.374
No idea.

27:35.475 --> 27:37.676
Okay, this could be toxic.

27:39.446 --> 27:41.213
I'll show you inside later.

27:41.314 --> 27:43.048
It's-it's uh...

27:43.149 --> 27:45.317
Hey, what do you think, huh?

27:45.418 --> 27:47.820
Top of the line,
all the bells and whistles.

27:47.921 --> 27:49.555
Well, I hope you don't
plan on parking it here,

27:49.656 --> 27:52.157
'Cause when I told you to move out,

27:52.259 --> 27:55.094
I didn't mean move out into the yard.

27:56.096 --> 27:58.364
No pleasing you.

27:58.465 --> 28:00.566
You know,
I hope Lisa doesn't extend her stay,

28:00.667 --> 28:04.169
but... I'll understand if she does,

28:04.271 --> 28:06.805
because you are impossible.

28:06.907 --> 28:09.608
I'll pick the rest of my stuff up later.

28:11.144 --> 28:13.379
Beautiful, look!

28:13.480 --> 28:15.581
Perfect!

28:15.682 --> 28:18.384
I think we have a budding
Georgia O'Keeffe on our hands.

28:18.485 --> 28:20.486
Jade, where did you get this paint?!

28:20.587 --> 28:22.821
Relax, it's washable,
kid-friendly, eco-paint.

28:22.923 --> 28:24.757
I thought Lyndy might like it,

28:24.858 --> 28:26.525
so I picked it up while I was in town.

28:26.626 --> 28:29.061
I thought I said only one treat.

28:29.162 --> 28:31.096
Yeah, but, she asked for it.

28:31.197 --> 28:32.731
You-how did you...

28:33.934 --> 28:35.501
did she go down for her nap yet?

28:35.602 --> 28:37.269
Uh, you didn't say anything about a nap.

28:37.370 --> 28:39.305
You didn't put her down for a nap?!

28:39.406 --> 28:41.206
We've been having fun,
does it look like she's tired?

28:41.308 --> 28:43.909
Jade, you're the adult,
she's just a child!

28:44.010 --> 28:46.045
It's okay, it's fine, I'll put her down

28:46.146 --> 28:48.447
for a quick nap now,
and you should probably

28:48.548 --> 28:49.715
go tend to Luke.

28:59.492 --> 29:01.327
Okay, okay.

29:02.429 --> 29:03.729
- Good boy.
- That was great.

29:03.830 --> 29:06.198
But I can already tell that
I'm gonna regret that tomorrow.

29:06.299 --> 29:09.401
Well, if it isn't Betty Thomas!

29:09.502 --> 29:11.003
- Awww!
- It's good to see you.

29:11.104 --> 29:13.405
I'm-I'm glad you're here.

29:13.506 --> 29:15.975
Likewise Jack,
it's been too long.

29:16.076 --> 29:18.544
You have got a beautiful spot here.

29:18.645 --> 29:20.546
- Thank you.
- Young people around,

29:20.647 --> 29:23.415
- lots goin' on.
- Yeah, well, I gotta admit,

29:23.516 --> 29:25.684
it does seem a little hectic at times,
but...

29:25.785 --> 29:28.220
Well, enjoy it while you can.

29:28.321 --> 29:32.558
'Cause when it's gone,
the silence is deafening.

29:43.236 --> 29:44.770
She's been jumping?

29:44.871 --> 29:46.672
- Oh yeah, she's out here more.
- Yeah?

29:46.773 --> 29:48.807
Oh, a trick saddle?

29:49.809 --> 29:51.677
Yeah, if you don't mind,

29:51.778 --> 29:53.779
I'd like to see what he can do.

29:53.880 --> 29:56.949
Sure, if the old boy's up for it.

30:04.090 --> 30:05.324
Come on, Georgie!

30:05.425 --> 30:06.959
Woo! Woo!

30:22.275 --> 30:24.410
Oh, that's so cool!

30:24.511 --> 30:26.812
Lookin' good, Georgie!

30:26.913 --> 30:29.281
Good, are you kidding? That's awesome!

30:29.382 --> 30:31.717
You're right, not half bad.

30:32.786 --> 30:35.621
Now... watch this.

30:40.493 --> 30:41.994
Okay...

30:49.402 --> 30:51.203
Go Betty, whoo!

31:28.908 --> 31:31.076
I just wish Betty could
still take care of him,

31:31.177 --> 31:33.378
and he didn't have to go back
to that boarding facility.

31:37.650 --> 31:39.485
Whoa.

31:45.225 --> 31:47.893
Oh well, you know,
Boots has always sorta been my baby,

31:47.994 --> 31:50.762
but you know what,
now he wants to come and see you.

31:50.864 --> 31:53.832
Betty, that was... that was epic.

31:53.933 --> 31:56.969
Yeah, not too bad for an old gal, huh?

31:57.070 --> 31:59.238
Betty that was really something.

31:59.339 --> 32:01.573
Well Luke,
Boots has had a pretty big day.

32:01.674 --> 32:04.109
- You wanna help us untack him?
- Sure.

32:04.210 --> 32:06.478
- Okay.
- I bet he could use a drink.

32:06.579 --> 32:07.946
Good idea.

32:11.050 --> 32:13.986
I've always admired the work
you do with horses, Amy.

32:14.087 --> 32:16.121
I'm glad that I finally got to meet you.

32:16.222 --> 32:18.357
Well, feel free to stop by anytime.

32:21.427 --> 32:25.397
Wyatt told me that you are
focusing on show jumping.

32:25.498 --> 32:27.332
I hope you don't forget
about trick riding.

32:27.433 --> 32:31.003
It would be a shame,
because you're a natural.

32:31.104 --> 32:34.640
Well,
that's high praise coming from you.

32:34.741 --> 32:36.241
I won't, I promise.

32:38.378 --> 32:39.978
I want to know why.

32:40.980 --> 32:43.849
Look, I, I owe you an apology,
I'm sorry.

32:43.950 --> 32:47.182
I was... really rude to you.

32:47.520 --> 32:50.422
But you did this for me anyway, why?

32:53.293 --> 32:56.562
We have a lot more in common
than just trick riding.

32:56.663 --> 33:00.532
I read about what
happened to your husband.

33:00.633 --> 33:02.367
I know what it's like.

33:02.468 --> 33:05.671
I lost both my parents in a
car crash when I was a baby,

33:05.772 --> 33:08.640
And I was lucky enough to end up here,
but...

33:09.676 --> 33:11.343
you lost Boots, too.

33:12.579 --> 33:14.646
Forced to let him go, and I...

33:14.747 --> 33:17.382
I can't imagine that
happening to Phoenix.

33:17.483 --> 33:18.283
So I just...

33:19.319 --> 33:21.520
I wanted to give you
some time with him today,

33:21.621 --> 33:24.923
even if it was only for a few hours.

33:27.560 --> 33:29.494
Thank you.

33:29.596 --> 33:32.030
- Okay, you ready?
- Yeah.

33:35.902 --> 33:38.804
I can't thank the two of
you enough for this day.

33:38.905 --> 33:41.273
Yeah, it was our pleasure, so...

33:45.111 --> 33:47.613
- Watch your feet, though.
- Mhmm.

33:49.048 --> 33:52.951
Yeah, I gotta say,
we still do make a pretty good team.

33:53.052 --> 33:56.421
- Yep, yeah, we do.
- Yeah, a little bit.

33:56.522 --> 33:59.891
Come on,
let's get this Mustang on the road!

33:59.993 --> 34:02.194
Okay.

34:21.147 --> 34:23.081
Hey, Luke.

34:24.217 --> 34:26.995
- Where's Boots?
- I let him go.

34:27.219 --> 34:29.621
- What?! Why would you do that?
- What were you thinking, Luke?

34:29.722 --> 34:32.157
Okay, come on, Georgie.
Let's go find him.

34:44.498 --> 34:47.933
So don't worry, uh,
this is the last of it.

34:48.034 --> 34:50.703
I'll be out of your hair in no time.

34:52.572 --> 34:54.773
So where you staying?

34:54.875 --> 34:57.610
Stumpy said I could stay
on a piece of his land,

34:57.711 --> 34:59.612
past Mclean Creek.

35:01.214 --> 35:03.282
- It's a nice spot.
- Yeah.

35:03.383 --> 35:05.818
- What's this?
- That is uh...

35:06.987 --> 35:08.988
not the same vintage, but...

35:09.089 --> 35:10.956
it came highly recommended.

35:11.057 --> 35:13.392
I dropped a pretty penny on it.

35:19.065 --> 35:21.133
Okay, well...

35:22.702 --> 35:25.404
see 'ya.

35:36.850 --> 35:38.918
Luke? Hey.

35:41.521 --> 35:43.923
I just don't get why
everyone's so freaked out.

35:45.358 --> 35:47.393
Well,
you're gonna have to help me understand

35:47.494 --> 35:49.495
- why you let Boots go?
- I was trying to help him.

35:50.564 --> 35:52.831
Okay.

35:52.933 --> 35:54.466
Well, you've gotta know
that Boots has had someone

35:54.568 --> 35:57.069
looking after him his whole life.

35:57.170 --> 35:58.837
And I know you were trying to help him,

35:58.939 --> 36:00.906
but setting him free
actually puts him in danger.

36:01.007 --> 36:03.642
He needs people to look after him.

36:03.743 --> 36:06.211
Just like you.

36:06.313 --> 36:08.547
I think Betty and Boots
should be together.

36:09.916 --> 36:11.884
Yeah.

36:11.985 --> 36:14.486
I know what you mean.

36:14.588 --> 36:16.055
But it's not always possible.

36:16.156 --> 36:18.958
But why does he have
to go to a bad home?

36:19.059 --> 36:20.526
Who said anything about a bad home?

36:23.263 --> 36:25.297
Because Betty can't take care of him.

36:26.800 --> 36:28.200
Huh.

36:29.269 --> 36:32.037
Are you talking about Betty, or...

36:32.138 --> 36:34.673
someone else?

36:34.774 --> 36:35.975
Maybe your mom?

36:36.076 --> 36:38.644
No way! My mom's amazing.

36:38.745 --> 36:40.546
It's just, she works a lot,

36:41.848 --> 36:44.350
so I'm alone.

36:44.451 --> 36:46.986
Well, we love having you here, Luke.

36:47.087 --> 36:49.755
So anytime your mom's at work,
you just give me a call.

36:49.856 --> 36:52.024
I can come pick you up.

36:52.125 --> 36:53.225
Okay?

36:56.663 --> 36:58.998
Let's head back.

37:02.369 --> 37:05.037
Honestly,
I kinda get why Luke let him go.

37:05.138 --> 37:06.438
Why?

37:06.539 --> 37:08.574
Well, I don't want Boots to
go back to that stable either!

37:08.675 --> 37:11.243
Isn't there something we can do?

37:12.679 --> 37:14.546
Hey, look!

37:14.648 --> 37:17.016
There he is.

37:25.058 --> 37:26.258
They found him!

37:28.828 --> 37:30.129
Is he okay?

37:30.230 --> 37:32.264
- He seems all right.
- Hey, Boots.

37:32.365 --> 37:34.366
Hey, can I talk to you for a minute?

37:34.467 --> 37:36.068
Yeah.

37:36.169 --> 37:38.704
I have a crazy idea,
that I wanna run by you.

37:40.573 --> 37:42.508
You wanna buy Boots?

37:42.609 --> 37:44.443
Yeah.

37:44.544 --> 37:46.278
Are you sure?

37:46.379 --> 37:49.515
He's an amazing horse, Ty,
and he deserves better.

37:49.616 --> 37:51.183
Plus him and Luke have really bonded,

37:51.284 --> 37:53.952
so maybe it'll give Luke a
reason to be around here more,

37:54.054 --> 37:55.554
come out of his shell.

37:56.756 --> 37:58.290
What do you think?

37:59.292 --> 38:01.460
I think I'm one lucky man.

38:08.835 --> 38:10.436
You can cluck.

38:10.537 --> 38:12.137
Keep him goin'.

38:12.238 --> 38:14.306
Good job.

38:25.618 --> 38:27.086
Whoa.

38:28.455 --> 38:31.090
Okay, turn away now.

38:56.282 --> 38:58.117
Good job.

39:03.223 --> 39:04.923
Hey, thanks again
for taking him this weekend.

39:05.024 --> 39:07.593
It looks like you made some progress.

39:07.694 --> 39:09.928
Yeah.

39:10.029 --> 39:12.064
Although...

39:12.165 --> 39:13.499
I'm thinking he's terrified

39:13.600 --> 39:16.034
of being taken away from his mom.

39:16.136 --> 39:18.370
What, did he come out and say that?

39:18.471 --> 39:20.339
Well, not directly, but...

39:20.440 --> 39:22.341
I know he's hiding something.

39:22.442 --> 39:24.643
I just need a bit more time
to get to the bottom of it.

39:26.513 --> 39:28.480
Hey, Luke?

39:28.581 --> 39:31.183
I got some news for you.

39:31.284 --> 39:32.951
Amy's made a deal to buy Boots.

39:33.052 --> 39:35.487
So, he's gonna live here at Heartland.

39:35.588 --> 39:37.723
- For real?
- Yeah.

39:37.824 --> 39:39.525
You can see him whenever
you come and visit, okay?

39:39.626 --> 39:42.828
That's awesome! So Betty can visit, too?

39:42.929 --> 39:45.364
Absolutely.

39:45.465 --> 39:47.366
Will you teach me how to ride?

39:47.467 --> 39:49.401
I would love to.

40:06.154 --> 40:08.009
- Hey.
- What's up?

40:08.590 --> 40:10.657
Sorry I'm late,
I had to help Jade with something.

40:10.758 --> 40:12.493
Oh yeah, it's okay.

40:12.594 --> 40:14.995
Um, your text was uh, kinda cryptic.

40:15.096 --> 40:16.797
What's up?

40:20.301 --> 40:22.202
Godzilla retrospective.

40:24.272 --> 40:25.672
Yeah, I was...

40:25.773 --> 40:28.509
thinking we could go together.

40:28.610 --> 40:31.912
Yeah. Yeah, like the uh, friend date.

40:32.013 --> 40:33.447
Yeah.

40:33.548 --> 40:36.562
Or... maybe like a real date.

40:37.685 --> 40:39.553
If you're up for it.

40:41.189 --> 40:43.056
The thing is, after...

40:43.158 --> 40:44.424
hanging out with you this weekend,

40:44.526 --> 40:48.061
I've kind of realized how much I...

40:48.163 --> 40:49.563
You missed me.

40:53.201 --> 40:56.203
Yeah, you missed me, yes, you did!

40:56.304 --> 40:59.039
Well, I missed you, too.

41:04.812 --> 41:07.614
- Jade!
- I'm here.

41:07.715 --> 41:10.150
Oh, thanks for coming, Jade.

41:10.251 --> 41:12.419
Yeah, you bet, what's going on?

41:12.520 --> 41:14.421
Well, first of all,
I have to be honest with you,

41:14.522 --> 41:15.956
and say that...

41:16.057 --> 41:18.258
I wasn't so sure about
you babysitting Lyndy.

41:18.359 --> 41:20.694
- Yeah, that makes two of us.
- But I was wrong.

41:20.795 --> 41:22.963
Amy and I have been talking,
and we wanna offer you

41:23.064 --> 41:25.132
a full-time baby-sitting gig with Lyndy.

41:25.233 --> 41:27.801
Wow, I'm flattered.

41:27.902 --> 41:30.504
And I love hanging out with Lyndy.

41:30.605 --> 41:34.241
- But I'm gonna have to pass.
- Hmm? Why?

41:35.276 --> 41:37.978
Well, I just had a great
appointment with my doctor.

41:38.079 --> 41:40.647
And I'm not a 100% yet
but I am improving,

41:40.748 --> 41:43.650
So I called Tim,
and I told him that I wanted to help out

41:43.751 --> 41:45.719
mentoring students at the rodeo school.

41:45.820 --> 41:48.755
That's great, you know,
I'm-I'm really happy

41:48.856 --> 41:51.391
to hear you're getting
back in the scene.

41:51.492 --> 41:53.660
Yeah, I... I hope you do well.

41:53.761 --> 41:56.263
Good for you, I mean, all the best.

41:56.364 --> 41:58.732
I pee.

41:58.833 --> 42:00.734
I pee.

42:00.835 --> 42:03.170
I pee.

42:05.173 --> 42:06.940
I only did about 80% of
the stuff in this book,

42:07.041 --> 42:08.709
but it seems to be working.

42:10.912 --> 42:12.646
Look at you, you cute little doodle!

42:12.747 --> 42:15.749
How was that? Good for you!

42:17.185 --> 42:18.752
- Did she just...
- Huh.

42:30.865 --> 42:33.667
- Nice setup you got here.
- Yeah, I'm happy with it.

42:35.176 --> 42:37.337
Coffee and biscuits.

42:37.438 --> 42:39.873
Made 'em this afternoon, new recipe.

42:39.974 --> 42:42.342
Oh, look at you,
opening yourself up to new things.

42:42.443 --> 42:43.877
Wonders never cease.

42:43.978 --> 42:47.147
And they're pretty darn good,
if I do say so myself.

42:47.248 --> 42:49.383
What're you doing here, Jack?

42:49.484 --> 42:50.884
I wanted to check out your place.

42:57.721 --> 42:59.693
You worried about me?

43:00.812 --> 43:02.445
Hardly.

43:02.672 --> 43:04.931
You missed me, right? Is that it?

43:06.934 --> 43:09.136
Don't make me regret coming here.

43:09.237 --> 43:11.004
Oh, come on, don't deny it.

43:11.105 --> 43:12.806
Will you let it go?

43:12.907 --> 43:14.941
Okay.

43:15.043 --> 43:17.477
Sure, yeah, I can let it go, 'cause...

43:17.578 --> 43:19.946
I know it's the truth.

43:21.261 --> 43:23.483
You miss me.
