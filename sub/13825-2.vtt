01:48.274 --> 01:49.442
Oh.

02:06.417 --> 02:08.169
Ohm.

02:20.598 --> 02:21.766
Pbbt.

02:27.522 --> 02:28.857
Ah!

04:14.295 --> 04:15.505
Ohm.

05:43.634 --> 05:45.136
Ohm.

07:00.128 --> 07:01.295
Uh?

07:14.976 --> 07:16.477
Uh?

08:40.478 --> 08:41.687
Ah.

10:05.229 --> 10:08.482
Mousey, your wish is my command.

10:40.014 --> 10:40.973
Fore!

11:32.274 --> 11:34.068
Huh? Huh, huh?

12:46.682 --> 12:47.766
Ah.

14:20.359 --> 14:21.652
Ah.

15:01.317 --> 15:03.235
Ah.

15:25.591 --> 15:29.345
After scouring the forest and beyond...

15:29.345 --> 15:33.015
...my magic potion
will be complete at last.

15:33.015 --> 15:37.603
The time has come
to remove my wretched curse.

15:37.603 --> 15:39.438
Eye of newt.

15:39.438 --> 15:41.357
Dust from house.

15:41.357 --> 15:43.025
Mandrake root.

15:43.025 --> 15:45.778
One fresh mouse.

15:45.778 --> 15:47.363
Huh?

15:50.032 --> 15:52.034
One fresh mouse.

15:54.745 --> 15:57.039
Where is my lazy assistant?

16:12.262 --> 16:15.557
Fetch me a fresh mouse
from the cupboard, pussycat.

16:15.557 --> 16:17.810
There's a whole jar of them in there.

16:36.370 --> 16:37.913
Mwah!

16:44.920 --> 16:46.839
I need that mouse.

16:46.839 --> 16:49.299
Do whatever it takes.

16:57.474 --> 16:58.726
Catch him.

17:48.776 --> 17:49.860
Oh!

17:49.860 --> 17:52.070
You break one more thing...

17:52.070 --> 17:53.739
...and I'll let you have it.

17:58.076 --> 17:59.203
Oh...

17:59.203 --> 18:02.122
Couldn't get me a mouse, huh?

18:02.122 --> 18:03.665
Well, from now on...

18:03.665 --> 18:07.127
...I'll turn you into a mouse
every time I see you.

18:07.628 --> 18:10.798
Understand me, pussycat?

18:29.900 --> 18:34.696
Well, well, you have a knack
for riding a witch's broom, kitty-cat.

18:34.696 --> 18:37.407
Where the heck did you learn that?

18:38.867 --> 18:40.118
Oh, her.

18:40.118 --> 18:42.704
We've had a wicked feud
going on for years.

18:42.704 --> 18:44.498
Can't stand that old crone.

18:47.459 --> 18:48.794
You neither?

18:48.794 --> 18:54.091
Well, we'll all get along just fine,
won't we?

19:03.767 --> 19:08.105
Oh! A present for me?

19:11.525 --> 19:13.861
An enchanted hatchet.

19:16.655 --> 19:17.739
Oh, no.

19:21.159 --> 19:22.578
You again.

19:24.288 --> 19:25.581
Ah!

19:25.581 --> 19:28.333
Ha! Don't say I didn't warn you.

19:29.668 --> 19:32.629
Pull a dirty trick on me, will she?

19:45.017 --> 19:46.435
Come here, you two.

19:46.435 --> 19:49.062
I've got a little job for you.

19:51.857 --> 19:54.026
Now, take this to that other witch...

19:54.026 --> 19:56.194
...and make sure she gets it.

19:56.695 --> 19:59.156
I said, go!

20:09.708 --> 20:11.710
Oh, for me?

20:13.003 --> 20:17.758
"Please enjoy this lovely fruitcake.
A secret admirer."

20:19.092 --> 20:21.470
Ee! I've been double-crossed.

20:25.432 --> 20:27.309
She got you too, pussycat.

20:28.310 --> 20:30.354
There.

20:38.612 --> 20:40.072
Fruitcake, my eye.

20:46.244 --> 20:47.329
Take that.

20:47.788 --> 20:50.499
Oh, yeah? Well, right back at you.

20:51.124 --> 20:54.002
What are you looking at, pussycat?

20:59.925 --> 21:02.010
Ah! Take that.

21:02.928 --> 21:04.972
You take that.

21:04.972 --> 21:06.598
An ax for a battle ax.

21:06.598 --> 21:10.227
What do you mean,
an ax for a battle ax?

21:10.227 --> 21:11.770
Take that.

21:14.439 --> 21:16.608
Take that.
Take that.

21:25.701 --> 21:29.204
I guess it was about time
we buried the hatchet.

21:29.204 --> 21:32.499
What the heck was it
we were fighting about anyhow?

21:32.499 --> 21:37.170
Oh, something about broomsticks
and a curse.

21:41.883 --> 21:45.220
Oh, I think the curse is about to be lifted.

21:46.138 --> 21:50.225
Thanks to you guys,
we can now assume our original forms.

21:53.061 --> 21:54.521
- We remember now.
- We remember now.

21:54.521 --> 21:59.192
Our master was mad
and cast a spell, turning us into witches.

21:59.192 --> 22:02.821
Because we was chasing
after the same thing.

22:02.821 --> 22:04.364
- Uh?
- Uh?
