00:01.022 --> 00:02.304
Narrator: <i>Christmas...</i>

00:02.362 --> 00:05.136
<i>The time of year when
the chill in the air...</i>

00:05.256 --> 00:07.601
<i>brings out the warmth in your heart.</i>

00:08.013 --> 00:10.099
<i>But what happens when
Christmas spirit...</i>

00:10.141 --> 00:12.807
<i>meets 140 degrees outside?</i>

00:18.719 --> 00:21.263
Lola: Bugs, Christmas is almost here.
Are you excited?

00:21.383 --> 00:25.992
Bugs: Not really. It's December
and it's 100 degrees out here.

00:26.072 --> 00:29.146
Lola: What are you saying?
Bugs: It's too hot for Christmas.

00:29.192 --> 00:30.833
Lola: Too hot for Christmas?

00:30.882 --> 00:32.913
How can you say such a thing?

00:32.946 --> 00:35.159
I feel woozy. Oh! Like I'm gonna faint.

00:35.382 --> 00:38.071
Bugs: That's because
you're wearing a parka.

00:38.105 --> 00:40.573
Lola: Huh? Oh.

00:44.875 --> 00:46.774
Oh, yeah.
That's much better.

00:46.813 --> 00:48.350
What were we talking about again?

00:48.391 --> 00:50.301
Bugs: Not doing Christmas this year.

00:50.356 --> 00:52.058
Ohh!

The Looney Tunes Show - Season 2 Episode 10
A Christmas Carol

01:07.539 --> 01:12.235
Original Air Date:
December 4, 2012

01:13.838 --> 01:16.901
Elmer Fudd: <i>And with no relief
in sight for this heat wave,</i>

01:16.927 --> 01:19.045
<i>it certainly doesn't
feel like Christmas.</i>

01:19.173 --> 01:22.409
<i>A year ago today, this was main street,</i>

01:22.443 --> 01:25.513
<i>and this is how it looks now.</i>

01:27.583 --> 01:30.721
Sam: <i> I thought selling Christmas
trees would be the perfect job.</i>

01:30.755 --> 01:33.817
<i>You make your money and you only
gotta work a couple of weeks a year.</i>

01:33.864 --> 01:36.028
<i>But it's so darned hot,
no one's buying 'em,</i>

01:36.083 --> 01:38.752
<i>and now they're all dried up.</i>

01:38.783 --> 01:40.532
<i>Aah! Fire!</i>

01:40.567 --> 01:42.400
<i>Fire! Aah!</i>

01:42.439 --> 01:46.178
Elmer Fudd: <i>Looks like this Christmas
is gonna be anything but merry.</i>

01:46.217 --> 01:47.577
Lola: What is wrong with everyone?

01:47.608 --> 01:49.876
A little heat and we all
just give up on Christmas?

01:49.911 --> 01:52.662
Hey, well, not me. I'm gonna
do something about it.

01:52.693 --> 01:55.357
I--I'm gonna go out there
and I'm gonna...

01:55.389 --> 01:56.706
I'm gonna...

01:56.746 --> 01:58.269
Put on a show.

01:58.326 --> 02:00.957
A show that captures the
true meaning of Christmas.

02:00.991 --> 02:02.659
Bugs: Like "A Christmas Carol"?

02:02.727 --> 02:05.162
Lola: Ohh. I was thinking "Cats."

02:05.196 --> 02:06.492
What's "A Christmas Carol"?

02:06.524 --> 02:09.166
Bugs: "A Christmas Carol."
Charles Dickens.

02:09.199 --> 02:12.436
Scrooge? Tiny Tim?

02:12.470 --> 02:14.439
Bah, humbug?

02:19.213 --> 02:23.249
Here. It's the world's
most famous Christmas story.

02:23.283 --> 02:24.950
Lola: Oh! Thanks, bun-bun.

02:24.985 --> 02:27.353
Mwah. I'm off
to save Christmas.

02:27.387 --> 02:31.458
I mean, Charles Dickens and I
are off to save Christmas.

02:33.327 --> 02:34.991
Man, it's hot out here.

02:35.023 --> 02:36.590
Ohh!

02:43.913 --> 02:46.156
Bugs: What are you doing?
Daffy: Making room.

02:46.225 --> 02:49.145
Bugs: For what? I don't want
to cook a turkey this year.

02:49.213 --> 02:50.113
It's too hot.

02:50.148 --> 02:52.749
Daffy: I'm making room for
a duck, not a turkey.

02:52.812 --> 02:55.429
Bugs: What are you? Insane?
You'll suffocate.

02:55.476 --> 02:57.135
Daffy: Well, it's better than being hot.

02:57.210 --> 03:00.659
Plus, I've heard suffocating's
the most pleasant way to go.

03:00.693 --> 03:02.695
Hmph.

03:03.798 --> 03:04.798
Wait.

03:04.845 --> 03:07.933
Or is it that suffocating's
the worst way to go?

03:07.968 --> 03:11.036
I should probably do a little research.

03:11.838 --> 03:13.506
Bugs: Hey, look. It's your buddy.

03:13.540 --> 03:15.266
Elmer Fudd: <i> In a related story,</i>

03:15.297 --> 03:18.351
<i>eccentric billionaire,
Foghorn Leghorn...</i>

03:18.398 --> 03:20.202
<i>held a press conference today</i>

03:20.233 --> 03:22.272
<i>and made a stunning announcement.</i>

03:22.318 --> 03:25.263
Foghorn: I've been--I say, I've
been hearin' a lot of whining...

03:25.294 --> 03:28.932
about how it's too hot to
celebrate Christmas this year.

03:28.975 --> 03:32.148
But I'm here to announce that
I'm gonna do something--

03:32.180 --> 03:34.985
I say, I'm gonna do something about it.

03:35.030 --> 03:36.965
Ladies and gentlemen,

03:36.999 --> 03:41.436
I give you the fan plan.

03:41.629 --> 03:44.758
- What is that?
Foghorn: It's a giant fan, boy,

03:44.813 --> 03:47.195
and I'm gonna set it up
at the north pole...

03:47.237 --> 03:49.729
and blow some of that
cold air down here.

03:49.791 --> 03:53.053
If I were you, I'd get your
sweaters out of the cedar closet,

03:53.088 --> 03:58.645
'cause I'm predicting-- I say, I'm
predicting a white Christmas.

03:59.242 --> 04:01.527
Bugs: That is one crazy rooster.

04:01.562 --> 04:04.261
I'm surprised you didn't get
roped into going with him.

04:04.295 --> 04:05.329
Daffy: Oh, I'm going.

04:06.298 --> 04:08.433
Daffy: Well, I'm off to the north pole.

04:08.467 --> 04:10.209
Should I bring a jacket?

04:10.240 --> 04:14.106
Nah, it's 1,000 degrees outside.

04:15.408 --> 04:18.611
Bugs, your girlfriend fainted.

04:26.253 --> 04:27.979
Lola: Thank you all for coming.

04:28.033 --> 04:30.346
Of course, we're all here
for the same reason.

04:30.393 --> 04:32.927
We care about the community.

04:32.961 --> 04:35.063
We love Christmas.

04:35.097 --> 04:37.532
And we love the theater.

04:38.261 --> 04:40.689
And one of you is here because
I needed you to drive me...

04:40.712 --> 04:42.253
because my nail polish wasn't dry yet.

04:42.304 --> 04:44.905
So, thanks, Bugs.

04:44.939 --> 04:47.630
Sam: Actually, I'm here
'cause I understand...

04:47.669 --> 04:49.575
this is an equity production.

04:49.609 --> 04:52.844
As in, guaranteed money?

04:54.580 --> 04:56.681
And I also love the theater.

04:56.715 --> 04:59.082
Lola: Ok, "A Christmas Carol."

04:59.113 --> 05:01.356
Now, just a little heads up
before you read the script.

05:01.388 --> 05:03.809
I have made a few teeny, tiny changes.

05:03.841 --> 05:05.287
Bugs: What are you talking about?

05:05.321 --> 05:08.950
Lola: I rewrote it.
Bugs: You rewrote a beloved classic?

05:08.997 --> 05:09.923
Lola: Eh, come on.

05:09.958 --> 05:11.271
Who could belove a story...

05:11.272 --> 05:13.723
about a mean old guy named
scrooge who hates Christmas?

05:13.754 --> 05:16.362
I'm sorry, but that's not gonna get
anybody in the holiday spirit.

05:16.397 --> 05:17.961
Bugs, you're gonna play Santa.

05:18.016 --> 05:20.717
Bugs: Uh, Santa's not in
"A Christmas Carol."

05:20.789 --> 05:21.953
Lola: Well, he's in this version.

05:21.999 --> 05:24.169
Mac and Tosh, you'll play Santa's elves

05:24.203 --> 05:26.036
Weevil and Beevil.

05:26.067 --> 05:27.825
You can decide amongst
yourselves who's who.

05:27.856 --> 05:30.842
Both: I'll be Weevil.
Oh! Then, I'll be Beevil.

05:30.876 --> 05:32.304
Mac: Do you want me to be Beevil?

05:32.343 --> 05:34.108
Tosh: Only if you don't
want to be Weevil.

05:34.147 --> 05:36.075
I could easily see myself as Beevil.

05:36.098 --> 05:38.448
Mac: But I also think you would
make a fantastic Weevil.

05:38.483 --> 05:40.183
Sam: Oh, no one cares.

05:40.238 --> 05:42.513
We can't tell you apart, anyway.

05:42.534 --> 05:45.029
Here. You're Weevil.
You're Beevil.

05:45.089 --> 05:46.771
Now, who am I?

05:46.818 --> 05:50.428
Lola: You are nightclub
impresario, Rick Evans.

05:50.462 --> 05:52.575
And Speedy, you're Manu Ginobili.

05:52.622 --> 05:54.153
Speedy: The basketball player?

05:54.207 --> 05:57.658
Lola: Now, Porky, you're gonna
play a very important part.

05:57.706 --> 06:01.005
You will be playing the role of Hambone.

06:01.039 --> 06:04.166
Porky: Ooh.
What about my script?

06:04.190 --> 06:05.557
Oh, Hambone doesn't talk.

06:05.604 --> 06:08.119
He's a pet pig.
He oinks.

06:08.166 --> 06:11.616
Well, I guess that's everyone.

06:12.218 --> 06:13.705
Oh, no!

06:13.744 --> 06:15.487
There's no one left to play Carol.

06:15.521 --> 06:16.583
Mac: Who's Carol?

06:16.622 --> 06:19.132
Lola: Carol? "A Christmas Carol"?

06:19.162 --> 06:20.797
The girl from the title of the play.

06:20.831 --> 06:22.933
Bugs: Ecch.
Poor Charles Dickens.

06:22.966 --> 06:24.734
Tosh: Well, why don't you play Carol?

06:24.762 --> 06:28.091
Lola: Me? Oh, no. I'm just the writer.
I'm not an actor.

06:28.135 --> 06:30.372
Besides, Carol has...  A British accent...

06:30.424 --> 06:32.095
that's essential to the role.

06:32.140 --> 06:36.491
And I couldn't possibly capture the many
layers of Carol's intricate personality.

06:36.529 --> 06:39.915
The highs and the lows of her journey,

06:39.953 --> 06:43.652
her desperation, her fear,
her strength, her courage.

06:43.707 --> 06:46.691
She's a temptress. Ooh, but
she's shy, almost coquettish.

06:46.730 --> 06:49.356
How could I capture her volatility?

06:50.406 --> 06:52.326
And she's so funny.

06:52.360 --> 06:56.664
♪ <i>And what about the song?</i> ♪

06:56.698 --> 06:58.864
Mac: Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

06:58.911 --> 07:01.309
Tosh: Mm-hmm. You
have to be Weevil.

07:01.340 --> 07:03.270
Mac: Spoken like a true Beevil.

07:05.614 --> 07:09.351
Foghorn: If you think rewriting "A
Christmas Carol" is a bad idea,

07:09.401 --> 07:13.771
heh, well, I believe
I can show you a worse one.

07:15.051 --> 07:17.530
Foghorn: It's time to jump.
Daffy: What?

07:17.577 --> 07:21.150
Foghorn: We can't land a big ol'
plane like this on that ice.

07:21.190 --> 07:24.759
Daffy: Are you out of your mind?
Whoa!

07:24.794 --> 07:28.564
Foghorn: There--I say,
there goes the fan.

07:28.598 --> 07:30.165
Come on, boy.

07:30.200 --> 07:33.002
Daffy: Aah!

07:35.005 --> 07:38.208
Foghorn: I say, "Aah!"

07:43.937 --> 07:46.321
Sam: I don't know about you,
but I read the script.

07:46.354 --> 07:48.055
It ain't worth the air conditioner.

07:48.089 --> 07:51.258
Lola: Ok, everyone.
We're starting rehearsal.

07:54.062 --> 07:56.204
We have got a town full
of people out there...

07:56.228 --> 07:57.868
who have lost the Christmas spirit,

07:57.938 --> 08:00.868
and I believe the only chance
we have of getting it back...

08:00.902 --> 08:02.836
is to put on a flawless production...

08:02.871 --> 08:06.459
of an almost unrecognizable
version of "A Christmas Carol."

08:06.492 --> 08:08.226
Places, everyone.

08:15.449 --> 08:17.214
Oh, Hambone, it looks like...

08:17.236 --> 08:19.384
it's just you and me this Christmas.

08:19.418 --> 08:20.284
Porky: Oink.

08:20.319 --> 08:22.887
Lola: Is that how you're gonna do it?

08:22.922 --> 08:23.788
Porky: Oink, oink?

08:23.823 --> 08:26.491
Lola: Yeah, you're gonna
need to work on that.

08:26.526 --> 08:28.727
Narrator: <i>Meanwhile, at the north pole,</i>

08:28.761 --> 08:32.231
<i>or about 70 miles South of there.</i>

08:32.265 --> 08:34.131
Daffy: I quit.
Foghorn: What?!

08:34.179 --> 08:36.541
Daffy: My sense of adventure
has been surpassed...

08:36.572 --> 08:41.472
by my sense of tiredness and
overall out-of-shapedness. Ugh.

08:43.732 --> 08:47.045
Foghorn: You can't quit now.
You'll freeze to death.

08:47.079 --> 08:48.613
Then, it's my time.

08:48.647 --> 08:51.483
Daffy: According to my research,
it's the most pleasant way to go.

08:51.539 --> 08:53.713
Foghorn: You're just
like the rest of 'em.

08:53.783 --> 08:56.633
When the going gets tough,
you just give up.

08:56.676 --> 08:59.812
Boo hoo! It's too hot
to celebrate Christmas.

08:59.846 --> 09:03.025
Boo hoo! It's too cold
at the north pole.

09:03.064 --> 09:05.470
Boo hoo! I'm too tired
to help a rooster...

09:05.509 --> 09:08.087
pull a 6,000-pound crate 70 miles...

09:08.144 --> 09:10.362
and build a giant fan.

09:10.385 --> 09:13.299
Well, then, go ahead and freeze, boy.

09:13.432 --> 09:15.873
I'm not giving up on Christmas.

09:15.908 --> 09:18.809
Unh!

09:18.844 --> 09:21.953
Narrator: <i>But sometimes,
even the coldest heart...</i>

09:22.000 --> 09:24.449
<i>can be warmed by the Christmas spirit.</i>

09:26.284 --> 09:29.654
Foghorn: I say, unh!

09:30.489 --> 09:32.590
Huh?

09:32.625 --> 09:33.658
Ah.

09:36.763 --> 09:38.145
Mac: Are you Carol?

09:38.184 --> 09:39.803
Yes. Who are you?

09:39.859 --> 09:41.702
Both: We're Santa's elves.

09:41.734 --> 09:43.593
Tosh: Santa Claus is missing.

09:43.632 --> 09:46.772
You must come with us to the
north pole and take his place.

09:46.806 --> 09:48.290
Lola: But why me?

09:48.313 --> 09:52.010
Mac: Because you are his daughter.

09:52.712 --> 09:54.947
Lola: Santa Claus is my father?

09:54.981 --> 09:56.574
That answers so many questions,

09:56.606 --> 09:59.351
yet, raises so many
additional questions.

09:59.385 --> 10:00.719
I know what I must do.

10:00.753 --> 10:02.854
It is crystal clear to me.

10:02.888 --> 10:05.488
I have to...

10:05.522 --> 10:06.295
Line?

10:06.342 --> 10:09.270
Bugs: I have to go with
you to the north pole.

10:09.301 --> 10:12.429
Lola: I have to go with you
to the--line?

10:12.463 --> 10:14.650
Bugs: To the north pole.

10:14.666 --> 10:18.369
Lola: Oh, yeah. I have to go
with you to the north...

10:18.403 --> 10:19.340
Bugs: Pole.

10:19.379 --> 10:21.110
Lola: I didn't say "line".

10:21.152 --> 10:24.604
I know my line. Sheesh.

10:24.639 --> 10:26.072
<i>Line?</i>

10:32.194 --> 10:34.044
Foghorn:  We're there!

10:34.075 --> 10:38.183
I say, we're there!
We're at the north pole.

10:38.217 --> 10:40.852
Daffy: Whoohoo! We made it.

10:40.886 --> 10:42.548
Daffy: Ahh!
Foghorn: Whoo-hoo!

10:42.594 --> 10:44.386
Daffy: I always knew we'd make it.

10:44.415 --> 10:47.632
Except for that one time I
laid down in the snow to die.

10:47.695 --> 10:50.312
But all the rest of the time,
I knew we'd make it.

10:50.382 --> 10:53.066
Well, not that one time
when I tried to kill you...

10:53.128 --> 10:55.534
so that I could climb inside
your carcass for warmth,

10:55.573 --> 10:57.333
but then realized how
hard it would be...

10:57.368 --> 10:58.910
to clean out your carcass,

10:58.965 --> 11:00.929
so, instead, I just laid down...

11:00.960 --> 11:03.905
for a second time in the snow to die.

11:03.939 --> 11:05.345
But every other time,

11:05.369 --> 11:07.908
I always knew we would make it.

11:07.942 --> 11:10.644
Whoo-hoo! Yeah! Whoo-hoo!

11:17.696 --> 11:19.162
Foghorn: That's all it do it.

11:20.266 --> 11:22.680
Narrator: <i>But even the
best laid plans...</i>

11:22.722 --> 11:26.120
<i>duck and roster often go arrive.</i>

11:26.154 --> 11:29.556
Foghorn: Hmm. I say, "Hmm."

11:29.591 --> 11:32.977
Daffy: What?
Foghorn: Where are we gonna plug it in?

11:33.034 --> 11:36.170
Daffy: Plug it in?
We have to plug it in?

11:36.211 --> 11:38.125
We're in the middle of nowhere.

11:38.180 --> 11:40.815
You didn't think about this
before we left?

11:40.859 --> 11:44.039
Why do I keep getting involved with you?

11:44.112 --> 11:45.115
It's that limo.

11:45.146 --> 11:47.509
I keep getting tricked by that limo.

11:47.543 --> 11:51.913
Foghorn: Wwsd. Wwsd.

11:51.948 --> 11:53.472
Daffy: What are you muttering?

11:53.511 --> 11:56.318
Foghorn: Wwsd.
What would Santa do?

11:56.367 --> 11:59.321
It's something I ask myself
when I need guidance.

11:59.355 --> 12:00.956
That's it!

12:00.990 --> 12:02.607
Daffy: What?
Foghorn: We'll plug it in.

12:02.654 --> 12:05.265
I say, we'll plug it in
in Santa's workshop.

12:05.302 --> 12:07.476
It's gotta be around here somewhere.

12:07.523 --> 12:11.202
Daffy: So, you want us to just
wander around the north pole...

12:11.217 --> 12:13.986
hoping to bump into Santa Claus?

12:14.027 --> 12:16.230
Foghorn: What's the worst
that could happen?

12:21.273 --> 12:22.949
Lola: Now, it's Christmas Eve.

12:23.020 --> 12:27.750
Carol and the gang have gathered
to confront Rick Evans.

12:27.784 --> 12:30.118
♪ Places everyone ♪

12:30.386 --> 12:33.322
Sam: Welcome to the bungalow room.

12:33.356 --> 12:35.124
I.D., please.

12:35.158 --> 12:36.925
Lola: Where is Santa Claus?

12:36.960 --> 12:38.344
Sam: How should I know?

12:38.399 --> 12:40.399
I'm an innocent nightclub owner.

12:40.445 --> 12:44.633
Lola: Well, if Rick Evans didn't
kidnap Santa, then--line.

12:44.667 --> 12:46.078
Bugs: Then where is he?

12:46.133 --> 12:48.552
Lola: Wow, do you have the whole,
entire play memorized?

12:48.583 --> 12:49.838
Bugs: Unfortunately.

12:49.872 --> 12:54.942
Lola: Well, if Rick Evans didn't
kidnap Santa, then where is he?

12:54.977 --> 12:58.079
Bugs: Ho ho ho.

12:58.113 --> 12:59.514
All: Santa!

12:59.548 --> 13:02.560
Lola: Where have you been?
We were so worried about you.

13:02.607 --> 13:05.115
Bugs: I must have lost track of time.

13:05.192 --> 13:09.004
I guess I know what I should
give myself for Christmas.

13:09.048 --> 13:11.098
A watch.

13:11.160 --> 13:15.162
Lola: Oh, ha ha ha! Santa.

13:15.197 --> 13:19.333
I mean dad.

13:19.954 --> 13:21.251
The end.

13:21.308 --> 13:22.823
Oh, you guys, I'm so excited.

13:22.862 --> 13:26.707
This is gonna be the best version
of "A Christmas Carol" ever.

13:26.775 --> 13:29.644
Tosh: Is it just me,
or is this play bad?

13:29.678 --> 13:32.981
Like, really, really bad?

13:36.318 --> 13:39.955
Foghorn:  We
have to take cover, boy.

13:39.989 --> 13:42.991
Daffy: I think I see it.

13:43.025 --> 13:45.327
Santa's workshop.

13:45.361 --> 13:48.295
Foghorn: No, you've got hypothermia.

13:48.319 --> 13:51.633
You're hallucinating.
I say, you're hallucinating.

13:51.667 --> 13:54.702
Daffy: I'm coming, Santa.

14:02.752 --> 14:04.078
Daffy: Ahh.

14:04.113 --> 14:06.314
Santa: <i> Looking for some
place to plug that in?</i>

14:08.883 --> 14:10.468
Daffy: Santa?

14:15.122 --> 14:16.465
Santa: You look cold.

14:16.513 --> 14:19.882
Why don't you take a seat by the fire?

14:24.497 --> 14:28.533
Daffy: You're so snuggly, Santa.

14:32.912 --> 14:36.010
- So, you're saying you installed
the giant fan at the north pole...

14:36.030 --> 14:39.272
and that any minute, it's gonna
start blowing in winter weather?

14:39.318 --> 14:42.364
Foghorn: I'm not the kind of
rooster to say I told you so,

14:42.388 --> 14:44.529
but I told you so.

14:46.252 --> 14:47.352
- How'd you do it?

14:47.387 --> 14:48.937
Daffy: We had a little help.

14:49.000 --> 14:51.823
You probably know him
as father Christmas,

14:51.858 --> 14:54.226
Saint Nick, the captain.

14:54.260 --> 14:57.561
But I call him Santa Claus.

14:57.596 --> 15:00.297
And I've got him on tape.

15:03.696 --> 15:05.631
Daffy: <i>Santa?</i>

15:08.106 --> 15:11.474
Daffy: <i>You're so snuggly, Santa.</i>

15:13.488 --> 15:16.090
Daffy: I sat on the
lap of a polar bear?

15:16.131 --> 15:18.181
Foghorn: I told you you
was hallucinating.

15:18.239 --> 15:20.685
Daffy: Then I guess I didn't
plug the fan in, either.

15:20.744 --> 15:23.801
Foghorn: I'll make the
next one battery-operated.

15:23.832 --> 15:25.699
Daffy: Next one?

15:32.015 --> 15:33.968
Lola: This is it. We did it.

15:33.996 --> 15:36.991
It's Christmas Eve
and we have a packed house.

15:37.042 --> 15:38.702
Sam: 'Cause of the air conditioner.

15:38.761 --> 15:41.479
Lola: I just want to thank you all for
your hard work and dedication,

15:41.509 --> 15:44.158
which I believe is the
true meaning of Christmas.

15:44.204 --> 15:46.739
Group hug.

15:48.346 --> 15:49.713
Hoo hoo hoo!

15:49.748 --> 15:51.213
Lola: <i>Oh, this seems
like a good time...</i>

15:51.245 --> 15:53.394
<i>to tell everyone about
the trap door I put in.</i>

15:53.449 --> 15:56.862
Trust me. It will make our entrances
and exits much more dramatic.

15:56.924 --> 15:59.090
Porky:  How do we get out?

15:59.124 --> 16:01.068
We're gonna suffocate.

16:01.114 --> 16:04.324
Tosh: Ooh, I've heard that's
the most pleasant way to go.

16:04.368 --> 16:05.589
Lola: I've heard that, too.

16:05.628 --> 16:07.132
But it's not gonna come to that.

16:07.166 --> 16:08.400
Bugs will get us out.

16:08.434 --> 16:09.768
Bugs! Bugs!

16:13.505 --> 16:15.240
Bugs: Hello?

16:15.274 --> 16:17.181
Lola: <i>We're down here.</i>

16:17.235 --> 16:18.369
Bugs: Lola?

16:18.423 --> 16:21.279
Lola: Bugs, we fell through
my trap door and we're stuck.

16:21.313 --> 16:24.249
Bugs: Trap door?

16:25.151 --> 16:26.600
How does it open?

16:26.662 --> 16:27.729
Lola: Yeah, I don't know.

16:27.779 --> 16:30.214
I think I might have focused
too much on the trap part

16:30.299 --> 16:32.624
and not enough on the door part.

16:35.371 --> 16:37.086
Bugs: It won't budge.

16:37.142 --> 16:39.649
Mac: What are we going to do?
The play starts in one minute.

16:39.713 --> 16:42.095
Lola: You'll have to tell everyone
the play is cancelled.

16:42.152 --> 16:43.971
Bugs: But you've worked so hard.

16:44.016 --> 16:46.273
Lola: Well, there's
nothing else we can do.

16:46.349 --> 16:47.683
Narrator: <i>And at that moment,</i>

16:47.709 --> 16:51.112
<i>Bugs Bunny found the Christmas spirit.</i>

16:51.963 --> 16:55.966
Narrator: <i>Too bad he didn't
also find a better script.</i>

16:56.016 --> 16:58.360
Bugs:  Oh, Hambone.
It looks like...

16:58.399 --> 17:01.188
it's just you and me this Christmas.

17:02.679 --> 17:04.688
Ha ha ha! Hambone.

17:04.729 --> 17:06.867
<i>You're such a funny pig.</i>

17:06.925 --> 17:08.858
<i>Ha ha ha!</i>

17:08.936 --> 17:11.387
Foghorn: Hey, look.
"A Christmas Carol."

17:11.419 --> 17:15.075
That's--I say, that's one
of my favorite plays.

17:15.121 --> 17:17.189
Daffy: Never heard of it.

17:22.541 --> 17:24.877
Bugs: Where is Santa Claus?

17:24.911 --> 17:27.194
Well, how should I know?

17:27.262 --> 17:29.563
I'm an innocent nightclub owner.

17:29.591 --> 17:33.427
Well, if Rick
Evans didn't kidnap Santa,

17:33.474 --> 17:35.775
then where is he?

17:37.669 --> 17:39.325
No!

17:39.381 --> 17:42.373
Lola: <i>Bugs, you weren't supposed
to use the trap door.</i>

17:42.429 --> 17:43.257
Bugs: Really?

17:43.314 --> 17:44.848
Speedy: Now what are we gonna do?

17:44.883 --> 17:46.416
There's no ending.

Santa: Ho ho ho!

17:56.734 --> 17:58.368
Daffy: Santa?

17:58.427 --> 18:00.219
Santa: I know what you're all thinking.

18:00.248 --> 18:03.185
This is the worst Christmas
play you've ever seen.

18:03.208 --> 18:06.132
And I can't say I disagree.

18:06.202 --> 18:09.874
<i>But it took a lot of effort
to put on a play this bad,</i>

18:09.913 --> 18:12.695
<i>and if there's one thing
that's worth the effort,</i>

18:12.730 --> 18:14.564
<i>it's Christmas.</i>

18:14.598 --> 18:17.534
Look, I know it's a lot of work,

18:17.568 --> 18:20.032
tying the tree to the top of your car

18:20.055 --> 18:21.594
and then dragging it inside.

18:21.632 --> 18:23.499
Pine needles going everywhere.

18:23.575 --> 18:27.678
<i>Packing up the car and driving
6 hours to grandma's house.</i>

18:27.720 --> 18:30.868
But these are the things
that bring us all together.

18:30.940 --> 18:35.604
Even this utterly unrecognizable
version of "A Christmas Carol."

18:35.687 --> 18:37.272
I mean, look around you.

18:37.296 --> 18:40.211
The whole town is here.

18:40.267 --> 18:43.444
Yes, I know that Christmas isn't easy,

18:43.465 --> 18:47.001
but nothing worth doing ever is.

18:48.633 --> 18:51.432
Now, if you'll excuse me,

18:51.470 --> 18:55.173
I've got to deliver presents to
every boy and girl on earth.

18:55.227 --> 18:57.642
You think that doesn't take
a lot of effort?

18:57.677 --> 18:59.811
Ho ho ho!

18:59.846 --> 19:02.581
Merry Christmas, everyone.

19:02.616 --> 19:03.516
Oh!

19:08.889 --> 19:11.824
Santa: Nice trap door.

19:11.859 --> 19:13.994
Let's see here.

19:14.028 --> 19:17.526
Lola. Bugs. Gophers.

19:17.567 --> 19:19.542
Aw, you can decide who gets what.

19:19.624 --> 19:20.901
Yosemite.

19:20.935 --> 19:24.004
Better luck next year.

19:24.039 --> 19:26.173
Speedy.

19:27.809 --> 19:30.177
Daffy: What the?

19:34.249 --> 19:35.449
Santa: <i>Hey, fellas.</i>

19:35.483 --> 19:40.072
Ha ha ha!
I plugged your fan in.

19:40.119 --> 19:41.931
