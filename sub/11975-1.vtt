WEBVTT

00:18.567 --> 00:21.333
Kylie, do you know how
to play this game?

00:21.333 --> 00:23.200
- Oh, yeah, you're a Jenner.
- I feel like you're

00:23.200 --> 00:25.133
- good, so...
- I'm really not.

00:25.133 --> 00:27.033
Like, who do you think I play
with?

00:27.033 --> 00:29.033
- Ah!
- Lamar?

00:33.167 --> 00:35.433
- Oh, it still bounced!
- Wait. Why do you

00:35.433 --> 00:38.933
- have all that cabbage?
- This? Because I need to

00:38.933 --> 00:41.267
- stop breastfeeding.
- So, is it on you

00:41.267 --> 00:43.867
- right now?
- Yeah. Green is the color

00:43.867 --> 00:46.033
I should put on, or does it not
matter?

00:46.033 --> 00:48.367
I think I put
green, but I only tried it once,

00:48.367 --> 00:52.033
and then, I decided not to stop
breastfeeding, and then, I was

00:52.033 --> 00:54.400
- done with the cabbage.
- Wait. I kind of, like...

00:54.400 --> 00:56.333
I was in the shower today, and
milk came out, and then, I was,

00:56.333 --> 00:58.333
", should I start
again?"

00:58.333 --> 01:02.067
- Can you?
- I would.

01:02.067 --> 01:05.500
Two months ago, I gave
birth to my son, Saint.

01:05.500 --> 01:09.133
He is the most beautiful boy
I've ever seen.

01:09.133 --> 01:11.900
But I'm not gonna lie.
Like, it is so hard.

01:11.900 --> 01:15.867
My mom used to always say, "One
is one, two is 20."

01:15.867 --> 01:20.233
And I really do feel that way.
Being a mom is so tiring.

01:20.233 --> 01:25.467
Don't you agree, Kourtney?

01:25.467 --> 01:27.367
I lost!

01:28.867 --> 01:30.867
That's why Kim and
Kanye are together, guys--

01:30.867 --> 01:33.267
'cause they fall asleep at the
drop of a dime.

01:33.267 --> 01:35.733
I think Kim just fakes
it half the time.

01:35.733 --> 01:38.567
Here! Put these  things
on your  and call it

01:38.567 --> 01:39.967
a day!
This is ridiculous!

01:39.967 --> 01:41.833
She has them on
under her clothes...

01:41.833 --> 01:43.667
I have them on, you
freak!

01:43.667 --> 01:45.500
...under her bra.
Relax!

01:45.500 --> 01:47.333
This is meant to kill
ya!

01:47.333 --> 01:49.267
Ooh!

02:05.533 --> 02:08.967
- Hello? Hi!
- Hey, Mom.

02:08.967 --> 02:10.967
How are you?
You look so skinny!

02:10.967 --> 02:12.600
Oh, my God, people
keep saying that to me, and I

02:12.600 --> 02:14.600
- don't know why.
- Yeah, I...

02:14.600 --> 02:16.467
I just ate a bag of
chips.

02:16.467 --> 02:18.267
- Oh, my God.
- You look cute.

02:18.267 --> 02:19.967
Well, eat another one!
Thanks. This is so great!

02:19.967 --> 02:22.100
- Is Lamar here?
- No.

02:22.100 --> 02:24.833
So much has happened in the past
few months.

02:24.833 --> 02:28.767
Lamar's recovery has been
nothing short of a miracle.

02:28.767 --> 02:31.600
Right now, they have to
stabilize all of his organs.

02:31.600 --> 02:35.500
They don't know yet how-how he's
gonna respond to all of it.

02:35.500 --> 02:37.867
Khloe can be at the hospital
every day, and maybe still sleep

02:37.867 --> 02:39.700
- at home.
- Well, I don't think

02:39.700 --> 02:41.700
- she was leaving his side.
- Yeah.

02:41.700 --> 02:45.500
I got told on Tuesday
that he will be discharged this

02:45.500 --> 02:47.533
Friday.
I'm very blessed and very happy.

02:47.533 --> 02:51.300
But it's just horrible timing,
'cause I have a whole New York

02:51.300 --> 02:53.967
press trip that's been planned
for ages now.

02:53.967 --> 02:56.967
And I feel like I have to get
him into a new house before I

02:56.967 --> 02:59.000
go to New York.
Mom?

02:59.000 --> 03:02.733
- Yeah. Hi!
- Hi. Jaime is gonna do

03:02.733 --> 03:04.667
- the walk-through with us.
- Yeah, we're bringing

03:04.667 --> 03:06.767
in all the furniture for Lamar,
so...

03:06.767 --> 03:08.967
- Okay. Okay, great.
- Yeah, show me around.

03:08.967 --> 03:11.433
- I'm really excited to see this.
- Good.

03:11.433 --> 03:13.433
Knowing Khloe, she
probably has this all organized

03:13.433 --> 03:15.433
in her brain, too.

03:15.433 --> 03:17.300
Everything should be
more oversized.

03:17.300 --> 03:19.200
- Right.
- 'Cause he's seven

03:19.200 --> 03:21.233
feet.
Think that we're, like, giants.

03:21.233 --> 03:23.067
- Yeah.
- We like big.

03:23.067 --> 03:24.867
- Ah.
- Do you guys have big

03:24.867 --> 03:26.700
- mirrors, like, huge ones...
- Yes.

03:26.700 --> 03:28.533
...that go against a
wall and just...?

03:28.533 --> 03:30.400
Yeah, mirrors would be
beautiful here.

03:30.400 --> 03:33.000
Great.
My mom has offered to help me

03:33.000 --> 03:36.067
install Lamar's house, and help
me find furniture for it.

03:36.067 --> 03:40.600
To find a house and... furnish
it, especially for a seven-foot

03:40.600 --> 03:44.333
tall man is a big request on
such a short amount of time.

03:44.333 --> 03:46.133
- I liked those.
- Yeah, those are great,

03:46.133 --> 03:47.933
Khloe.
That's what I would choose.

03:47.933 --> 03:49.600
- I'm so excited. Yeah.
- Good! Good!

03:49.600 --> 03:51.433
- We're really excited.
- I'm going to New York,

03:51.433 --> 03:53.433
and so, I was, like, frantic,
'cause I want to get all this

03:53.433 --> 03:56.233
stuff done, but now I'm like,
"Okay, I can go to New York.

03:56.233 --> 03:58.067
I feel better!"
I'll be there for you,

03:58.067 --> 03:59.833
- Khloe.
- But if anyone could

03:59.833 --> 04:01.667
get this job done, it's
definitely my mom.

04:01.667 --> 04:03.367
This area is perfect,
and this outdoors is gorgeous.

04:03.367 --> 04:05.867
Think a big rug.
Yeah, and the outside, too.

04:05.867 --> 04:07.867
I just want it to look really
nice.

04:07.867 --> 04:09.733
- Yeah.
- Just so, you know, if

04:09.733 --> 04:11.733
you're in an environment that
looks good, you feel good, and I

04:11.733 --> 04:14.333
want him to feel like he has a
home for his journey of, like,

04:14.333 --> 04:16.333
- constantly getting better.
- Yeah.

04:16.333 --> 04:18.000
I want him to feel
good about the place he's

04:18.000 --> 04:19.833
staying in.
So, that's what I'm hoping you

04:19.833 --> 04:21.500
- guys could help me with.
- Yeah, we'd love to.

04:21.500 --> 04:23.367
- Yeah, it's perfect.
- Yeah, so thank you for

04:23.367 --> 04:26.967
that. Good!
So far, we're on the same page.

04:26.967 --> 04:29.000
Perfect.

04:29.000 --> 04:31.400
Why is Kim sending me
this?

04:31.400 --> 04:35.100
Oh, my God, I'm literally dying.

04:35.100 --> 04:38.167
Oh, hi, blondie!

04:38.167 --> 04:42.300
- Hi!
- Oh, my goodness!

04:42.300 --> 04:44.300
- What's going on?
- I'm plotting my

04:44.300 --> 04:46.200
- comeback.
- Yeah, you can't leave

04:46.200 --> 04:48.200
Kim alone for too long.

04:48.200 --> 04:50.900
Kim has been in hiding after she
has had Saint.

04:50.900 --> 04:54.133
She is trying on her wigs,
trying on her new looks, and

04:54.133 --> 04:56.133
how she's going to reveal
herself to the public when she

04:56.133 --> 04:58.367
first comes out.
Those pictures of me?

04:58.367 --> 05:01.600
Seriously?
It's like I was wearing a

05:01.600 --> 05:03.233
- fat suit.
- You were a different

05:03.233 --> 05:05.667
- person.
- I am.

05:05.667 --> 05:07.167
my
bathroom?

05:07.167 --> 05:09.733
- Yes, it is!
- I can't leave you alone

05:09.733 --> 05:14.067
for more than five minutes.

05:23.833 --> 05:28.700
- This is... nice!
- Here, I'll show you

05:28.700 --> 05:32.133
around a little.
I recently bought this house to

05:32.133 --> 05:35.467
move closer to the family, and
now I'm living very close to

05:35.467 --> 05:38.267
Kourtney and actually down the
street from Kris.

05:38.267 --> 05:40.667
You know, unfortunately, I feel
like you always kind of learn

05:40.667 --> 05:44.200
your lesson when things have
already passed and it's too

05:44.200 --> 05:46.467
late.
I wasn't really around for a

05:46.467 --> 05:49.767
little bit for everybody, and,
you know, it's disappointing and

05:49.767 --> 05:53.067
hurtful to myself, but I'm
trying to make up for it, I

05:53.067 --> 05:55.300
guess you'd say.
Oh, you got to see P's room.

05:55.300 --> 05:57.233
- She picked this out.
- She said, "I want

05:57.233 --> 05:59.000
- polka dots"?
- She wanted this color.

05:59.000 --> 06:00.833
Black, pink and yellow
polka dots.

06:00.833 --> 06:04.433
- Aw. How cute is she?
- She's  cute.

06:04.433 --> 06:10.167
It's definitely, definitely a
lot, lot nicer to be close to

06:10.167 --> 06:14.267
everybody, and there's just a
sense of feeling like you

06:14.267 --> 06:16.400
- actually have family around.
- What a nice closet!

06:16.400 --> 06:18.300
- Yeah.
- This is absolutely

06:18.300 --> 06:20.133
- perfect.
- Yeah, no, it's-it's

06:20.133 --> 06:21.967
- nice.
- Then you're gonna find

06:21.967 --> 06:24.933
a girl who's going to take over
your closets.

06:24.933 --> 06:26.633
- What does that mean?
- Like, men always get

06:26.633 --> 06:28.567
- this much closet when they...
- I don't want a

06:28.567 --> 06:30.967
- girlfriend.
- Whenever, in 80 years.

06:30.967 --> 06:33.967
Ew.
I'm not thinking about that, to

06:33.967 --> 06:37.300
be honest.
Kourtney will always be...

06:37.300 --> 06:41.767
a huge motivation in my life.
I mean, no matter whether we're

06:41.767 --> 06:45.467
together or not, she's still was
with me for ten years, and, you

06:45.467 --> 06:47.900
know, we've been through a lot
of things together.

06:47.900 --> 06:50.800
How serene is this?
You get the outside so you never

06:50.800 --> 06:53.000
feel depressed.
Look how beautiful that is!

06:53.000 --> 06:56.267
Yeah, I'm still
depressed.

06:56.267 --> 06:58.967
- How are you depressed?
- 'Cause I'm single, and

06:58.967 --> 07:02.867
I live here by myself.
I fell in love with the house

07:02.867 --> 07:07.267
that I'm in... until I actually
moved in and realized that it's

07:07.267 --> 07:13.100
way, way, way too big for a
single human being living alone.

07:13.100 --> 07:15.400
You know, I'm sure a lot of
people wish these were their

07:15.400 --> 07:19.467
problems, but it's a drop lonely
living alone in a big house.

07:19.467 --> 07:21.467
I'm so excited about
this.

07:21.467 --> 07:23.467
Get your food on.
Is Bob still living with you, or

07:23.467 --> 07:25.467
- what?
Mm-hmm. But do you

07:25.467 --> 07:28.067
want to hear the craziest story?
Rob was asking what time would I

07:28.067 --> 07:31.633
be home, and I got home 30
minutes earlier than the time

07:31.633 --> 07:35.100
that I told him I was coming
home, so I walked in on him with

07:35.100 --> 07:38.500
- Blac Chyna at my house.
- Excuse me?!

07:38.500 --> 07:40.567
There's alcohol
everywhere.

07:40.567 --> 07:42.833
He's having the time of his
life!

07:42.833 --> 07:45.900
I don't need this.
Don't you dare make me feel

07:45.900 --> 07:50.067
uncomfortable in my own home!
I don't really care who Rob

07:50.067 --> 07:54.667
dates, but having Chyna over at
my house without my knowledge is

07:54.667 --> 07:56.900
disrespectful.
Why can't he be honest with me

07:56.900 --> 08:01.267
and communicate?
Because Robert knows Chyna's

08:01.267 --> 08:05.433
Tyga's ex-girlfriend, and I just
don't want that drama in my

08:05.433 --> 08:08.433
personal space.
I told him, I said, "You've

08:08.433 --> 08:10.533
burned your last bridge."
Yeah, really, what a

08:10.533 --> 08:12.533
nightmare everything
has become.

08:12.533 --> 08:17.600
Dude, everything!
I'm like, "What did I do?"

08:24.633 --> 08:27.167
You want to take it
on my phone?

08:27.167 --> 08:29.267
- I can do it on yours.
- P.S. I did a thing

08:29.267 --> 08:32.133
- on you on my app today.
- You did?

08:32.133 --> 08:35.133
So, I feel like we
should take a picture and then,

08:35.133 --> 08:37.467
like, on my app, like, I could
Instagram it to, like, link to

08:37.467 --> 08:40.233
- it.
- I love this as an

08:40.233 --> 08:42.167
but I brought
some other stuff.

08:42.167 --> 08:44.367
Was there anything else of your
personal stuff you want to try?

08:44.367 --> 08:49.167
Yeah.
The Ellen Show

08:49.167 --> 08:51.933
next week.
Now that my app is launching, I

08:51.933 --> 08:55.800
love to be able to talk about
the positive things in my life,

08:55.800 --> 09:00.633
but I haven't done any press for
anything in about three years.

09:00.633 --> 09:03.800
I haven't talked about anything
since Scott and I broke up, and

09:03.800 --> 09:07.267
- I'm so nervous.
- Cute!

09:07.267 --> 09:09.467
You look very badass in this
outfit.

09:09.467 --> 09:11.867
- Hello?
- Hi.

09:11.867 --> 09:15.367
- Oh, my God, what is that?
- This is Piño.

09:15.367 --> 09:17.767
Kylie, you didn't
tell me that you have to dance

09:17.767 --> 09:20.033
- when you walk out.
- I didn't dance on

09:20.033 --> 09:21.700
- Ellen.
- I'm doing it on

09:21.700 --> 09:23.500
Thursday.
I'm like, "Why did I agree to

09:23.500 --> 09:25.167
this?"
I didn't know that you have to

09:25.167 --> 09:26.833
dance.
Do you get to pick a song?

09:26.833 --> 09:30.133
- I was so nervous.
- Why am I nervous?

09:30.133 --> 09:32.900
I don't know why.
Literally... Monica was there.

09:32.900 --> 09:36.267
I don't remember what I said for
the first, like, 60 seconds.

09:36.267 --> 09:39.133
- And she did so good.
- I don't remember.

09:39.133 --> 09:42.133
Like, do I take a
shot before?

09:42.133 --> 09:46.300
I haven't ever seen
Kourtney this nervous for

09:46.300 --> 09:48.733
anything, but I know exactly how
it feels 'cause I was just as

09:48.733 --> 09:50.500
Ellen.
And I'm just gonna be there for

09:50.500 --> 09:52.767
- her.
- Do I literally not

09:52.767 --> 09:55.767
dance at all when I walk out?
Like, I just don't move?

09:55.767 --> 09:57.467
I just walked and was,
like...

09:57.467 --> 09:58.933
I'm not gonna be
like...

09:58.933 --> 10:00.933
No.
I mean, it would be

10:00.933 --> 10:02.967
- kind of funny if you did that.
- I could be like,

10:02.967 --> 10:05.700
"Hey."
That's cute.

10:05.700 --> 10:08.900
Like, I just think
it's, like, humiliating.

10:08.900 --> 10:21.467
For real.♪ ♪

10:21.467 --> 10:24.133
Chop-chop.
- Hi.

10:24.133 --> 10:26.900
How are you, honey?
Mwah. You look handsome.

10:26.900 --> 10:28.900
- Thanks. You look nice.
- Thanks for inviting me

10:28.900 --> 10:31.700
out to lunch.
Does this mean you're buying?

10:31.700 --> 10:34.233
- Sure.
- I'm so excited.

10:34.233 --> 10:38.133
Kris has honestly been
really, really, really

10:38.133 --> 10:40.667
supportive of me throughout all
of this.

10:40.667 --> 10:43.567
And, truthfully, if the tables
were turned, you know, I don't

10:43.567 --> 10:46.700
know how I would be towards a
guy like me.

10:46.700 --> 10:49.067
And she's been amazing.
So, you know, it's been a real

10:49.067 --> 10:53.867
blessing for me, so...
It's pretty unbelievable.

10:53.867 --> 10:57.400
Devils on horseback.
Ceviche.

10:57.400 --> 11:00.733
Crispy California ca...
Ooh, chicken sauté lettuce cups.

11:00.733 --> 11:02.733
Yeah, that sounds
nice.

11:02.733 --> 11:06.200
Fried avocado?
Chicken wonton, peanut, sesame,

11:06.200 --> 11:08.667
citrus.
I'm gonna have the baby kale

11:08.667 --> 11:11.467
- Caesar.
- Congratulations.

11:11.467 --> 11:14.500
Vegan... Thank you.
Vegan-Ceasar dressing, almond,

11:14.500 --> 11:16.500
- gluten-free...
- I'm not gonna lie,

11:16.500 --> 11:18.833
it's very difficult for me to
try to look through the menu if

11:18.833 --> 11:22.167
you read everything out loud.
I'm trying to find something.

11:22.167 --> 11:24.167
Okay, sorry.
So, wait, have you eaten here

11:24.167 --> 11:26.167
- before?
- Yeah, Kourtney and I

11:26.167 --> 11:27.833
used to come here once in a
while.

11:27.833 --> 11:29.833
Aw.
That's sad.

11:29.833 --> 11:32.500
She's not dead.

11:32.500 --> 11:35.500
- So tell me about you.
- Physically, fine.

11:35.500 --> 11:38.833
Emotionally, I'm always.
But I love the new house, and

11:38.833 --> 11:41.167
it's gorgeous, and I'm happy
that I'm near you guys, and it

11:41.167 --> 11:43.533
makes me feel a little bit more
safe, and I like that I have,

11:43.533 --> 11:45.867
- you know, it's gated and...
- I like that you're

11:45.867 --> 11:47.867
- behind gates.
- ...it's definitely

11:47.867 --> 11:51.533
changed my life for the better
in the sense of, um... I see the

11:51.533 --> 11:53.533
kids every single day.
Today they'll come over and have

11:53.533 --> 11:55.533
dinner with me and watch a
movie and...

11:55.533 --> 11:57.533
Nice. And you're so
close.

11:57.533 --> 11:59.200
They picked out their
own bedrooms.

11:59.200 --> 12:01.200
Mm-hmm.
- But, you know,

12:01.200 --> 12:04.533
everybody keeps saying, like,
"Just wrap yourself up with work

12:04.533 --> 12:07.533
and you'll feel better," and I'm
just like, "I've tried that."

12:07.533 --> 12:11.200
Like, I just really just want to
feel decent and be happy and

12:11.200 --> 12:13.200
- take care of the kids.
- You know what?

12:13.200 --> 12:16.900
I think you seem to be making
really good choices.

12:16.900 --> 12:20.233
And you're putting your kids
first, which is amazing.

12:20.233 --> 12:23.233
You're gonna get to a place of
happiness where it's just gonna

12:23.233 --> 12:25.567
feel, all of a sudden, really
good.

12:25.567 --> 12:27.567
We'll see where things
go.

12:27.567 --> 12:31.233
I don't know.
I mean, I'm a 32-year-old man

12:31.233 --> 12:33.567
that lives alone.♪ ♪

12:33.567 --> 12:39.567
You know, in the back of my
mind, Kourtney's always there.

12:39.567 --> 12:43.567
So all I can do is hope
one day things fell into place

12:43.567 --> 12:46.900
and I can be able to raise my
kids together with her, but, you

12:46.900 --> 12:49.267
know, at the end of the day, I
still love Kourtney, and that's

12:49.267 --> 12:54.267
what's important to me, and it
always will be.

12:54.267 --> 12:56.267
I was jumping from

12:56.267 --> 12:58.267
- show to show.
- Do you think you

12:58.267 --> 13:00.267
and Lamar could ever get back
together?

13:00.267 --> 13:03.267
You obviously love him very
much.

13:03.267 --> 13:06.600
I'm actually hurt
that you regifted my

13:06.600 --> 13:08.267
- gift.
- This is the first time

13:08.267 --> 13:10.267
you've ever gotten me a gift in
your entire life.

13:10.267 --> 13:12.067
There are some
things that just aren't cool,

13:12.067 --> 13:18.067
and I don't think this is very
cool.

13:23.100 --> 13:27.100
What are you doing?
You freak.

13:27.100 --> 13:29.100
I just, like, was
looking at my old pictures on

13:29.100 --> 13:32.767
Instagram last night, and I
just posted some throwbacks.

13:32.767 --> 13:35.767
- Look how cool I was.
- You're not cool

13:35.767 --> 13:37.767
- anymore?
- No, I'm cooler.

13:37.767 --> 13:40.767
Oh yeah.
You can't pull out your

13:40.767 --> 13:43.100
eyelashes while we're having
a conversation, 'cause it's

13:43.100 --> 13:45.767
really hard to look at you.
It's gross.

13:45.767 --> 13:47.100
Okay, but do you see
that one that keeps falling

13:47.100 --> 13:48.433
- in my eye?
- Yeah. Why?

13:48.433 --> 13:50.100
- I don't know.
- It's gross.

13:50.100 --> 13:51.767
I've tried everything.
Curling it. I was gonna cut it

13:51.767 --> 13:54.433
- out with scissors this morning.
- I've had one that was

13:54.433 --> 13:57.133
coming in my... like, down, for
a good year.

13:57.133 --> 13:58.800
And guess what I finally had to
do.

13:58.800 --> 14:00.800
- Cut it?
- I had to tweeze it.

14:00.800 --> 14:04.133
To tweeze a  eyelash from
your eyeball?

14:04.133 --> 14:05.800
- I'm ruthless.
- Oof.

14:05.800 --> 14:09.133
Ugh.
I'm so overwhelmed 'cause I have

14:09.133 --> 14:12.133
- to... pack.
- Are you excited?

14:12.133 --> 14:13.800
For your tour?

14:13.800 --> 14:16.133
It's not, like, a
tour, just New York.

14:16.133 --> 14:19.800
Gone for three days.
I'm leaving for New York for my

14:19.800 --> 14:22.133
press tour and this is the
first week Lamar is gonna be

14:22.133 --> 14:25.133
home from the hospital.
And it is really causing me a

14:25.133 --> 14:29.167
ton of anxiety, and I think my
only comfort right now is

14:29.167 --> 14:31.500
knowing that my mom will be by
Lamar's side and there to help

14:31.500 --> 14:34.500
me with whatever I need.
I'm kind of not comfortable, you

14:34.500 --> 14:38.167
know, leaving L.A. right now.
I don't have a caregiver, I

14:38.167 --> 14:40.500
don't have any of that, so I'm
just, like, I have to leave him

14:40.500 --> 14:42.833
- with people that I trust.
- Yeah.

14:42.833 --> 14:44.833
'Cause he can't sleep
alone or anything.

14:44.833 --> 14:46.833
He doesn't have a phone or
anything like that, like, in

14:46.833 --> 14:48.500
case something happens.
That's okay.

14:48.500 --> 14:50.833
Going to New York.
So I leave Tuesday.

14:50.833 --> 14:53.500
- It's a lot.
- I know, it's a lot.

14:53.500 --> 15:02.867
Don't freak me out more.♪ ♪

15:02.867 --> 15:04.867
- Hello.
- Hi.

15:04.867 --> 15:06.867
- This looks so nice.
- Welcome to the

15:06.867 --> 15:08.533
Wellness Kitchen.

15:08.533 --> 15:10.533
My name is Erika Wong.
I'm one of the registered

15:10.533 --> 15:12.533
dieticians here.
Today we're gonna focus on

15:12.533 --> 15:15.867
kid-friendly recipes.
But really our whole philosophy

15:15.867 --> 15:18.533
in here is about plant-based
nutrition.

15:18.533 --> 15:20.533
And that's how the kids
eat, that's how Kourtney likes

15:20.533 --> 15:22.200
- 'em to eat anyway.
- Oh, trust me, I get

15:22.200 --> 15:23.867
- it. I know.
- So, yeah.

15:23.867 --> 15:26.867
Kris and I have
decided we are going to take a

15:26.867 --> 15:30.200
little cooking class.
Kourt's over-the-top extreme

15:30.200 --> 15:32.533
with the whole gluten-free,
organic.

15:32.533 --> 15:34.867
She's like, "I don't think it's
right that he eats Cap'n Crunch

15:34.867 --> 15:37.567
there because he wants to come
over there just so he can eat

15:37.567 --> 15:39.567
Cap'n Crunch."
So I'm trying to do everything I

15:39.567 --> 15:41.233
- can.
- Yeah.

15:41.233 --> 15:44.900
So I want to at least
be able to supply healthy food

15:44.900 --> 15:48.233
for the kids when they're at my
house, and I mean, I think

15:48.233 --> 15:50.900
Kourtney will appreciate it.
I feel like I'm cutting up

15:50.900 --> 15:52.567
- somebody's body.
- Scott.

15:52.567 --> 15:55.233
- Oh my.
- To be able to cut

15:55.233 --> 15:56.900
something, it's... pretty proud
of myself.

15:56.900 --> 15:58.500
- Good. That's really...
- You did a good job.

15:58.500 --> 16:00.500
- Yeah, thank you.
- So we're moving on to

16:00.500 --> 16:02.500
- turkey meatballs.
- Ooh, meatballs.

16:02.500 --> 16:04.833
- That sounds fun.
- So garlic has a

16:04.833 --> 16:06.833
- tendency to burn.
- Never turn your back

16:06.833 --> 16:08.833
- on garlic.
- Right.

16:08.833 --> 16:10.867
Never go against the
family, Kris.

16:10.867 --> 16:12.867
Just got to get in
there like that.

16:12.867 --> 16:14.867
I got one meatball
stuck in there.

16:14.867 --> 16:16.867
- Okay.
- This is a lot of work.

16:16.867 --> 16:18.867
It's not really.
This is nothing compared to a

16:18.867 --> 16:20.867
- lot of recipes.
- I'm from New York.

16:20.867 --> 16:22.867
I'm just so used to just
ordering in.

16:22.867 --> 16:24.867
I know, but it's gonna
be so much healthier for the

16:24.867 --> 16:26.867
- kids.
- Okay.

16:26.867 --> 16:29.533
And Kourtney's gonna be
really happy.

16:29.533 --> 16:32.867
I think Scott is finding his
way.

16:32.867 --> 16:36.867
And I think he realizes that he
messed up a good thing.

16:36.867 --> 16:40.867
He was with Kourtney for the
last decade, and that's a big

16:40.867 --> 16:44.567
change for anybody.
All I want to do is just be here

16:44.567 --> 16:47.567
for him right now.
His kids are my grandchildren.

16:47.567 --> 16:51.567
- So, yeah, I love Scott a lot.
- Oh, the cauliflower is

16:51.567 --> 16:53.900
- amazing.
- Cauliflower is so good.

16:53.900 --> 16:56.900
- I love the chicken.
- Mmm, mmm, mmm.

16:56.900 --> 16:58.900
Well, this could be your new,
like, hobby.

16:58.900 --> 17:00.567
No, I love it.
I mean, I...

17:00.567 --> 17:02.233
You could become, like,
one of the biggest chefs in

17:02.233 --> 17:03.900
- the world.
I-I don't... I don't

17:03.900 --> 17:06.900
think that's gonna happen.
But I'll settle for the

17:06.900 --> 17:09.900
- smallest.
- You never know.

17:21.767 --> 17:25.100
Morning, Khloe.

- Uh, great.

17:27.433 --> 17:29.433
- How about you?
- I'm good. Thank you.

17:29.433 --> 17:34.100
- I wanted to say hi to Lamar.
- He is finishing up his

17:34.100 --> 17:36.100
shower right now.
Um, do you want me to have him

17:36.100 --> 17:38.100
- call you when he steps out?
- Yeah, I would love

17:38.100 --> 17:39.767
- that.
- All right, Khloe, have a

17:39.767 --> 17:41.433
good one.
He'll call you in a few, okay?

17:41.433 --> 17:43.333
Okay, thank you.

17:46.433 --> 17:48.767
It is really, really hard being
away from Lamar.

17:48.767 --> 17:51.133
All I'm thinking about is, is
Lamar okay?

17:51.133 --> 17:54.133
Is he eating at the right time?
Is he being taken care of?

17:54.133 --> 17:57.133
But I have to get it together.
I'm in New York for my press

17:57.133 --> 18:00.067
tour, and it's gonna be crazy.
I have so many places lined up,

18:00.067 --> 18:02.433
and I have to try and just
focus.

18:02.433 --> 18:04.967
I'm just jumping from show to
show.

18:04.967 --> 18:07.300
- Live with Seth Meyers.
- Khloe

18:07.300 --> 18:09.800

18:09.800 --> 18:11.600
Live with Kelly and
Michael.

18:11.600 --> 18:13.600
Please welcome
Khloe Kardashian.

18:13.600 --> 18:15.600
Howard Stern.
I love you always.

18:15.600 --> 18:19.300
- There's just so much going on.
- Howard Stern and you,

18:19.300 --> 18:22.100
you guys are so magnetically
crazy.

18:22.100 --> 18:24.100
That made me so

18:24.100 --> 18:26.833
- nervous.
- Because?

18:26.833 --> 18:28.933
Um, just the Lamar
questions.

18:28.933 --> 18:31.700
Obviously, I know I have to talk
about it, but that's-- I'm not

18:31.700 --> 18:34.233
- one to talk about that stuff.
- I was glad that you

18:34.233 --> 18:36.233
opened up more than I thought
you would.

18:36.233 --> 18:38.233
And those are his kind of
questions all the time.

18:38.233 --> 18:40.600
But I just, I don't
like talking about someone else.

18:40.600 --> 18:44.033
Like, that's for them to talk
about.

18:44.033 --> 18:47.633
Howard and everyone else today
keeps asking me about my

18:47.633 --> 18:50.033
relationship with Lamar.
How am I doing?

18:50.033 --> 18:52.033
Am I back together?
And like, I just...

18:52.033 --> 18:55.700
I don't know.
It's just a really difficult

18:55.700 --> 18:57.733
- thing to answer.
- To begin the year

18:57.733 --> 18:59.733
with Caitlyn,
Yeah.

18:59.733 --> 19:01.733
...and end the
year with Lamar, do you think

19:01.733 --> 19:03.733
you and Lamar could ever get
back together?

19:03.733 --> 19:07.533
You obviously love him very
much.

19:07.533 --> 19:10.200
I've learned to say
never say never, because if you

19:10.200 --> 19:12.900
would've asked me two years ago
if this is what the events would

19:12.900 --> 19:14.900
have happened in my life, I
would've said never!

19:14.900 --> 19:16.900
- Right.
- But now, I can't say

19:16.900 --> 19:19.067
that.
I love Lamar, and we've been

19:19.067 --> 19:21.900
through so much, but there's
so much more that has to be

19:21.900 --> 19:24.233
resolved.
There's a lot of hurt and things

19:24.233 --> 19:26.867
that need to be fixed.
I don't know.

19:26.867 --> 19:31.333
I'm figuring out where I really
am right now.

19:31.333 --> 19:33.400
I drank this
calming tea.

19:33.400 --> 19:35.900
Wait, you're not
supposed to have calming tea

19:35.900 --> 19:37.900
- The Ellen Show!
- Why?

19:37.900 --> 19:40.233
I thought I needed to calm down.
I was like, "I'm gonna have

19:40.233 --> 19:42.567
heart attack."

19:42.567 --> 19:44.933
She can tell me to
off all she wants, I

19:44.933 --> 19:46.933
don't have a relationship with
her.

19:46.933 --> 19:50.533
I am getting insane, aggressive
texts from Caitlyn.

19:50.533 --> 19:52.600
I'm done.

20:04.633 --> 20:06.633
I mean, how gorge do
you look?

20:06.633 --> 20:08.933
- Gorge!
- Oh, my goodness,

20:08.933 --> 20:10.933
everybody has so much energy!
I feel like...

20:10.933 --> 20:12.667
Well, I don't.
I drank this calming tea

20:12.667 --> 20:14.000
- at home.
- Wait...

20:14.000 --> 20:15.500
I was yawning the
whole car ride up.

20:15.500 --> 20:17.500
- I almost fell asleep.
- You're not supposed to

20:17.500 --> 20:19.500
have calming tea before you
The Ellen Show!

20:19.500 --> 20:21.333
Why?
I thought that I needed to calm

20:21.333 --> 20:23.300
down.
I was like, "I'm gonna have a

20:23.300 --> 20:25.233
heart attack."
No, you are gonna do

20:25.233 --> 20:26.833
great.
Why are you so nervous?

20:26.833 --> 20:28.367
You've done a million talk
shows.

20:28.367 --> 20:30.367
- I know!
- So, just relax.

20:30.367 --> 20:33.067
Just go out there and tell them
how much you love your mom.

20:33.067 --> 20:36.933
- That'll calm your nerves.
- I think I'm so

20:36.933 --> 20:40.433
The Ellen Show,
because there's been, you know,

20:40.433 --> 20:43.633
a lot going on with everybody
in our family, and it's like,

20:43.633 --> 20:46.433
if you say the wrong thing,
everyone gets mad.

20:46.433 --> 20:49.200
And I just... you know?
I never know what someone's

20:49.200 --> 20:53.367
gonna ask.

20:53.367 --> 20:57.533
- Hello, guv'nah!
- How's it going?

20:57.533 --> 20:59.833
Oh, it's going!
Your sister looks really cute!

20:59.833 --> 21:02.233
Khloe, do you
really want me to Facetime you?

21:02.233 --> 21:04.233
You're Kourtney
Kardashian in a gold

21:04.233 --> 21:06.233
- lamé suit!
- Yeah.

21:06.233 --> 21:08.300
- Yes.
- Kourtney is just

21:08.300 --> 21:10.967
getting back into the swing of
things after she's gotten back

21:10.967 --> 21:13.633
into the best shape of her life,
and she's the old Kourtney

21:13.633 --> 21:15.967
again.
It's kind of cute that she's so

21:15.967 --> 21:18.833
nervous.
But she looks great.

21:18.833 --> 21:20.833
What is wrong with
you?

21:20.833 --> 21:22.833
- I'm fine.
- She's just feeling a

21:22.833 --> 21:25.700
- little bit insecure today.
- No, I'm not

21:25.700 --> 21:27.733
- insecure-- what the?
- Oh, sorry.

21:27.733 --> 21:30.700
- We are ready for you.
- Yeah.

21:30.700 --> 21:33.567
I'll be back!

21:33.567 --> 21:36.367
- Hi!
- Um, can I ask you

21:36.367 --> 21:38.967
about Scott?
How is he? What's going on?

21:38.967 --> 21:41.133
Are y'all together or are you
not together?

21:41.133 --> 21:43.167
Well, we're not
together.

21:43.167 --> 21:46.067
I feel like every day is
different, but we're totally

21:46.067 --> 21:49.900

three beautiful kids together,

21:49.900 --> 21:52.433
- and...
- They are beautiful.

21:52.433 --> 21:54.433
- Thank you.
- Does Justin Bieber

21:54.433 --> 21:58.133

- Well, you did great.
- Wasn't the

22:05.200 --> 22:07.800

- No! It was fun!

seemed so cool, calm, collected.

22:09.800 --> 22:11.800
Well, I don't even
know what the  I said.

22:11.800 --> 22:13.800
- No, it was funny.
- It went by so fast!

22:13.800 --> 22:16.067
And you looked
beautiful... gorgeous.

22:16.067 --> 22:18.800

like, such a relief.

little angel?

22:36.767 --> 22:38.800
Well, I wanted to call
you to tell you about these

22:38.800 --> 22:41.300
texts I got from Caitlyn.
She was like, "What happened to

22:41.300 --> 22:45.133
family sticking together?"
I am on this New York press trip

22:45.133 --> 22:48.933
and I am getting insane,
aggressive texts from Caitlyn.

22:48.933 --> 22:51.233
It all stems from my Howard
Stern interview.

22:51.233 --> 22:53.467
But I said nothing
inappropriate, I said nothing

22:53.467 --> 22:58.067
that was new information,
everything has been said before.

22:58.067 --> 23:01.667
I said, "You slaughtered my
mother and you have the nerve

23:01.667 --> 23:04.733
to say, 'What happened to family
sticking together?'"

23:04.733 --> 23:07.233
I said, "You jumped that ship as
soon as you did Diane Sawyer,

23:07.233 --> 23:11.267
and you, like, attacked my mom!"
But instead, tells me to get

23:11.267 --> 23:14.400
a life and to shut up, and all
this, I'm like, "You shut up

23:14.400 --> 23:18.033
and you get a  life!"
Mom, can you handle this?

23:18.033 --> 23:21.167
- Yes.
- If Caitlyn were to

23:21.167 --> 23:24.733
actually listen to my interview,
she would know that nothing bad

23:24.733 --> 23:27.633
- or harmful was said.
- She could tell me to  off

23:27.633 --> 23:32.033
all she wants, I don't have a
relationship with her, I'm done.

23:32.033 --> 23:35.100
- Do you like this?
- I kind of wanted

23:35.100 --> 23:38.133
Kourtney's opinion a little bit.
She did run my life for 11

23:38.133 --> 23:40.200
- years.
- Okay, I'm gonna go.

23:40.200 --> 23:42.200
- Bye, guys.
- All I wanted was kind

23:42.200 --> 23:45.233
of her two cents, but she seems
to not really care.

23:45.233 --> 23:47.867
What's going on
with Khloe?

23:47.867 --> 23:49.867
Well, yes, she's out
there talking  about me.

23:49.867 --> 23:53.133
- Don't bring it up!
- You were her dad since

23:53.133 --> 24:00.067
she was five years old.
Like, give her a break!

24:06.733 --> 24:11.467
Yes?

24:11.467 --> 24:14.533
- Hi!
- Hey, how you doing?

24:14.533 --> 24:18.967
Well, I'm good, I-I'm
just a little concerned, like,

24:18.967 --> 24:22.467
- what's going on with Khloe?
- Well, she's out

24:22.467 --> 24:26.133
there talking  about me.
See, now, I don't want her

24:26.133 --> 24:29.200
- talking about me, okay?
- You don't go on  Howard

24:29.200 --> 24:33.000
- Stern, call me a liar...
- She was doing

24:33.000 --> 24:36.367
interviews, and I don't think
she really thought about the

24:36.367 --> 24:39.367
- fact that you might come up.
- Then say, "I don't

24:39.367 --> 24:42.333
talk about that, Caitlyn is
"doing great, I've never seen

24:42.333 --> 24:46.200
her happier, next question."
We're the parents, we

24:46.200 --> 24:52.167
have to be the bigger force of,
of their emotional stability.

24:52.167 --> 24:55.067
Then don't, then
don't have her going out to the

24:55.067 --> 24:58.267
- press.
- Khloe has enough going

24:58.267 --> 25:01.633
on right now with Lamar, and
is very stressed out.

25:01.633 --> 25:05.500
The last thing she needs is
anyone getting angry at her

25:05.500 --> 25:08.667
about anything, especially
Caitlyn.

25:08.667 --> 25:12.133
I don't think Khloe would ever
say anything to intentionally

25:12.133 --> 25:16.167
hurt anybody, and everybody
just has to understand that

25:16.167 --> 25:18.467
sometimes things are
misinterpreted.

25:18.467 --> 25:20.467
Why does she even
talk about it?

25:20.467 --> 25:23.600
- Don't bring it up!
- What do you think I

25:23.600 --> 25:26.567
Vanity Fair,
you  say something nice

25:26.567 --> 25:28.667
or you don't say anything
at all!

25:28.667 --> 25:31.233
Nothing was said
that was terrible in that

25:31.233 --> 25:33.400
- article.
- All you said was

25:33.400 --> 25:38.167
negative!
So, now you know how I feel!

25:38.167 --> 25:42.467
This is not intentional.
You're making this, like, so

25:42.467 --> 25:45.433
- hard.
- Khloe's out there

25:45.433 --> 25:48.133
telling a bunch of
about the family!

25:48.133 --> 25:50.900
Khloe isn't out to get
you.

25:50.900 --> 25:54.367
- You were her father!
- Don't...

25:54.367 --> 25:57.267
Okay, but you were her
dad since she was five years

25:57.267 --> 25:59.833
old.
Like, give her a break!

25:59.833 --> 26:04.567
Being a mom can be so difficult
when you have to protect your

26:04.567 --> 26:07.600
kids and look out for what's
best for them.

26:07.600 --> 26:10.867
I hate it when any of my kids
are having a hard time about

26:10.867 --> 26:14.733
anything, and it can sometimes
be so overwhelming that I just

26:14.733 --> 26:18.067
want to break down.
But at the end of the day,

26:18.067 --> 26:20.733
I want to be there for them
no matter what.

26:20.733 --> 26:24.867
If she wants to call
me and discuss it, I will calmly

26:24.867 --> 26:28.967
discuss it, okay?
All right?

26:28.967 --> 26:31.400
- Okay.

A big one?
The massive one?

27:25.400 --> 27:26.900
- Yes, shut  up.

to find out through social

posted it.

just aren't cool, and I don't

Call him right now and say, "I

her anger towards him since Tyga

41:29.633 --> 41:33.133
and Scott are together all the
time, so I'm kind of stuck

41:33.133 --> 41:37.167
- between a rock and a hard place.
- Scott needs to grow some

41:37.167 --> 41:39.767
- balls and be a bigger person.
- No, he just needs

41:39.767 --> 41:41.833
- to grow up.
- Yeah.

41:41.833 --> 41:45.467
But I'm saying not
for me, for my kids.

41:45.467 --> 41:50.333
Scott really needs to want
to get his life in the right

41:50.333 --> 41:55.133
direction for himself, but I
just don't want Tyga to be like

41:55.133 --> 41:59.500
a negative influence on Scott.
So, it just gives me a bad taste

41:59.500 --> 42:02.533
in my mouth.
It pisses me off that people

42:02.533 --> 42:06.600
like Tyga, who should know
better, that are close to our

42:06.600 --> 42:18.600
family, that don't just, like,
find some other friends.

42:18.600 --> 42:20.367
Keeping
Up with the Kardashians...

42:20.367 --> 42:24.133
My one fan.

42:24.133 --> 42:26.067
- Thank you, Khloe.
- Are you thinking about

42:26.067 --> 42:27.633
- having a third?
- Kanye has said it every

42:27.633 --> 42:29.400
single day.
I don't think I could carry

42:29.400 --> 42:31.233
another one.

42:31.233 --> 42:33.533
I just can't remember
what it's like to go out and

42:33.533 --> 42:37.000
nobody know who I am.

42:37.000 --> 42:39.067
Oh, my God, there's
a paparazzi.

42:39.067 --> 42:42.367
Lamar wants to go to Kanye's
fashion show.

42:42.367 --> 42:44.433
This is Lamar's first time out

42:44.433 --> 42:46.400
- in public.
- This is the most epic

42:46.400 --> 42:49.433
- day!
- I'm nervous about

42:49.433 --> 42:51.200
- meeting Caitlyn.
- What's up?

42:51.200 --> 42:54.167
- We got to talk.
- You guys know where you

42:54.167 --> 42:55.767
- are?
- Vail.

42:55.767 --> 42:58.200
- Go for it.
- Here's to creating new

42:58.200 --> 43:00.800
memories.
Oh, my God.

43:00.800 --> 43:03.933
I don't think a girl's

43:03.933 --> 43:06.333
- ever done that for me.
- No successful

43:06.333 --> 43:09.133
relationship can happen in Los
Angeles.

43:09.133 --> 43:13.133
- Let's move.
- He's done so good.

43:13.133 --> 43:17.100
I almost want to call Tyga,
just literally go off on him.

43:17.100 --> 43:19.233
You think I'm, like,
the bad guy all the time.

43:19.233 --> 43:21.367
He still has to make a decision
as a man.

43:21.367 --> 43:24.200
- Trust me, I'm trying.
- Welcome home, baby.

43:24.200 --> 43:26.667
The fact that now he
wants to be so public blows my

43:26.667 --> 43:28.567
- mind.
- I don't want no

43:28.567 --> 43:30.067
- fighting.
- You make sure that your

43:30.067 --> 43:31.933
girlfriend doesn't publically
bash your sisters.

43:31.933 --> 43:33.700
No.
He proposed in front

43:33.700 --> 43:35.833
- of her whole family.
- That's so  up.

43:35.833 --> 43:37.867
Listen to your hostility
in your voice.

43:37.867 --> 43:39.700
That's exactly why I don't say
anything.

43:39.700 --> 43:41.700
This is the first time I ever
proposed to someone in my life.

43:41.700 --> 43:44.867
Don't come at me with some
bull.

43:44.867 --> 43:47.500
