WEBVTT

00:01.198 --> 00:02.264
It's been a year

00:02.264 --> 00:03.998
since chef Gordon Ramsay
traveled across the country

00:03.998 --> 00:06.831
trying to help failing
restaurateurs.

00:06.831 --> 00:07.831
Tell everybody
to  go home.

00:07.831 --> 00:09.164
I'm shutting the place down.

00:09.164 --> 00:10.931
They don't know what
the  they're doing.

00:10.931 --> 00:13.531
I'm a loser, everybody.
I'm the worst.

00:13.531 --> 00:15.131
They may have asked
for his help,

00:15.131 --> 00:17.031
But that didn't stop them
from fighting Chef Ramsay

00:17.031 --> 00:18.331
every step of the way.

00:18.331 --> 00:20.131
Don't you  go there!

00:20.131 --> 00:21.164
Don't point that
thing at me.

00:21.164 --> 00:22.264
I'll do what the
I like.

00:22.264 --> 00:24.264
I think you're a jerk.

00:24.264 --> 00:26.498
Well, you can't just act like
a precious princess.

00:26.498 --> 00:28.964
Yeah, I look like a
princess, right?

00:28.964 --> 00:30.000
Now, one year later...
How are you?

00:30.000 --> 00:30.798
Now, one year later...
How are you?

00:30.798 --> 00:32.264
Chef Ramsay is back,

00:32.264 --> 00:34.364
asking the questions we all
want the answers to.

00:34.364 --> 00:35.931
Did you really hate me
that much?

00:35.931 --> 00:37.031
Did you pay
the money back?

00:37.031 --> 00:38.331
Has he become less
of a snob?

00:38.331 --> 00:40.131
Get ready for a night
of big surprises

00:40.131 --> 00:41.831
as Chef Ramsay finds out
what happened to

00:41.831 --> 00:44.831
the restaurants he tried
to save.

00:44.831 --> 00:48.298
First, we return to Lido's in
Manhattan Beach, California...

00:48.298 --> 00:49.464
You come out,

00:49.464 --> 00:50.764
make us look like
in front of,

00:50.764 --> 00:53.964
like, friends and customers.

00:53.964 --> 00:55.298
Where a young, immature owner

00:55.298 --> 00:56.931
Spent more time running
to the bathroom

00:56.931 --> 00:58.864
than running her restaurant.

01:02.898 --> 01:04.598
And we'll check in
on Anna Vincenzo's

01:04.598 --> 01:06.298
in Boca Raton, Florida...

01:07.531 --> 01:09.231
Can I get some
servers back here?

01:09.231 --> 01:11.431
Run by a hot-tempered owner

01:11.431 --> 01:13.298
Who was completely resistant
to change.

01:13.298 --> 01:14.965
Oh, you're gonna get
your  ass kicked.

01:14.965 --> 01:16.965
Finally, we'll get updated
on Le Bistro

01:16.965 --> 01:18.465
in Lighthouse Point,
Florida.

01:18.465 --> 01:19.465
He wants medium-rare.

01:19.465 --> 01:21.265
Tell him to go  himself.

01:21.265 --> 01:24.131
Andy the owner not only lashed
out at his customers...

01:24.131 --> 01:26.465
Are you looking for naked women
dancing on the table?

01:26.465 --> 01:28.365
He went after Chef Ramsay
as well.

01:28.365 --> 01:30.000
You don't intimidate me.
What?

01:30.000 --> 01:30.431
You don't intimidate me.
What?

01:30.431 --> 01:32.431
Tonight, you will see it all.

01:32.431 --> 01:34.298
I can't keep doing it.
I'm done.

01:34.298 --> 01:35.698
Whose restaurants are cooking

01:35.698 --> 01:37.765
And who turned their kitchen
back into a nightmare?

01:37.765 --> 01:39.565
Can I hit him now?

01:58.598 --> 02:00.000
When I arrived
in Manhattan Beach--wow.

02:00.000 --> 02:00.931
When I arrived
in Manhattan Beach--wow.

02:00.931 --> 02:02.631
This is the California dream.

02:02.631 --> 02:05.531
I wanted to move there.
This little town was amazing.

02:05.531 --> 02:08.065
Just 1/2 an hour outside L.A.

02:08.065 --> 02:09.431
Beautiful beaches,
beautiful people.

02:09.431 --> 02:12.531
But one of its local
restaurants, Lido,

02:12.531 --> 02:16.098
was an ugly mess.

02:16.098 --> 02:18.065
Biggest problem?
Lisa.

02:18.065 --> 02:22.465
An owner completely clueless
on how to run a business.

02:22.465 --> 02:23.931
I don't want
to hear complaints.

02:23.931 --> 02:25.231
I don't want
to hear.

02:25.231 --> 02:26.398
I just want to hang out.

02:26.398 --> 02:27.765
Ay.

02:27.765 --> 02:29.431
She had a couple of diplomas.

02:29.431 --> 02:30.000
Big deal.

02:30.000 --> 02:31.265
Big deal.

02:31.265 --> 02:32.798
The problem was that Lisa
treated Lido

02:32.798 --> 02:36.065
less like a business and more
like a sorority party.

02:36.065 --> 02:39.465
Damien is bar manager

02:39.465 --> 02:44.065
and someone that I have been
kind of dating

02:44.065 --> 02:46.031
in the last six months.

02:46.031 --> 02:47.565
Thank you.

02:50.431 --> 02:51.431
- Hello.
- Hi.

02:51.431 --> 02:52.698
How are you?
Very well, thank you.

02:52.698 --> 02:54.065
How are you?
Good.

02:54.065 --> 02:55.465
I'm Lisa Hemmat.
Lisa, nice to see you.

02:55.465 --> 02:56.398
How old are you if you don't
mind me asking?

02:56.398 --> 02:57.531
28.
28.

02:57.531 --> 02:58.731
So you got it
when you were 23?

02:58.731 --> 03:00.000
23.
What was that,
a graduation present?

03:00.000 --> 03:01.398
23.
What was that,
a graduation present?

03:01.398 --> 03:02.398
So I'm gonna have
a quick bite to eat.

03:02.398 --> 03:03.431
Okay.
Thank you.

03:06.198 --> 03:08.298
That's just gross.

03:08.298 --> 03:10.398
Ugh.

03:10.398 --> 03:12.265
This was definitely gonna
be a big challenge.

03:13.265 --> 03:14.265
I'll bypass.

03:14.265 --> 03:17.231
Thank you though.

03:17.231 --> 03:20.131
The chefs were a pair of
brothers, Arturo and Luis.

03:20.131 --> 03:22.431
That night's dinner service,
I realized Lisa

03:22.431 --> 03:23.965
wasn't holding them
to any standard

03:23.965 --> 03:25.531
in the kitchen whatsoever.

03:25.531 --> 03:27.431
When was the last time you
looked in this fridge?

03:27.431 --> 03:30.000
Uh, I never really
examined it.

03:30.000 --> 03:30.798
Uh, I never really
examined it.

03:30.798 --> 03:32.465
How long ago do you think
that was sliced?

03:32.465 --> 03:34.598
I don't know.
A couple of days.
Roughly?

03:34.598 --> 03:37.365
Couple of days?
That is scary.

03:37.365 --> 03:40.031
The old food was disgusting.

03:40.031 --> 03:43.065
But what I found next
was an absolute disgrace.

03:43.065 --> 03:45.531
Stop!
You!

03:45.531 --> 03:47.698
Everybody, stop!

03:47.698 --> 03:49.365
Lisa, come here.

03:49.365 --> 03:51.398
When was the last time this
place was cleaned?

03:51.398 --> 03:53.031
They should be cleaning
every day.

03:53.031 --> 03:54.298
But look.

03:54.298 --> 03:56.698
Everywhere--disgusting.
Look at it.

03:56.698 --> 03:59.298
This is above food.

03:59.298 --> 04:00.000
I mean, come on.

04:00.000 --> 04:00.898
I mean, come on.

04:00.898 --> 04:02.298
Luis, I am not serving

04:02.298 --> 04:03.298
food like this.

04:03.298 --> 04:04.398
Okay.

04:04.398 --> 04:06.765
That is disgusting.

04:06.765 --> 04:08.731
I don't think it really
has affected

04:08.731 --> 04:10.731
or gone in the food.

04:10.731 --> 04:13.298
How do you know?

04:13.298 --> 04:15.431
Lisa just wasn't getting it,
so I had no option

04:15.431 --> 04:17.131
but to do something
really drastic.

04:17.131 --> 04:18.931
All these tables here,
can I borrow you

04:18.931 --> 04:20.265
for two seconds, please?

04:20.265 --> 04:21.398
Follow me.

04:21.398 --> 04:23.798
I just stopped serving
food in here

04:23.798 --> 04:26.798
because of the
and the dust.

04:26.798 --> 04:29.431
Are you interested in being
served dinner with that filth?

04:29.431 --> 04:30.000
Mmm, no.

04:30.000 --> 04:30.531
Mmm, no.

04:30.531 --> 04:31.698
That's your customers.

04:31.698 --> 04:34.431
You need me
to tell you that?

04:34.431 --> 04:35.598
Laugh.

04:35.598 --> 04:37.065
I'm not laughing.

04:37.065 --> 04:38.065
I think you're a jerk.

04:38.065 --> 04:40.031
Excuse me.

04:40.031 --> 04:43.898
Lisa.

04:43.898 --> 04:45.531
You come out, make us look like
in front of,

04:45.531 --> 04:49.031
Like, friends and customers.

04:49.031 --> 04:50.598
Lisa, you are
totally oblivious

04:50.598 --> 04:52.098
to what's happening
in your business.

04:52.098 --> 04:54.298
You may have bought the
restaurant at 23, my darling,

04:54.298 --> 04:55.531
but you're not
running it.

04:55.531 --> 04:58.031
Grow up, Lisa,
will you?

05:02.398 --> 05:04.698
Things were getting surreal.

05:04.698 --> 05:07.065
While the staff were cleaning
the kitchen...

05:07.065 --> 05:08.365
- He's right.
- Filthy.

05:08.365 --> 05:11.698
Impatient...S were getting

05:11.698 --> 05:14.731
and Lisa was hiding
in the toilet.

05:14.731 --> 05:16.031
She's in the restroom
and the restaurant's

05:16.031 --> 05:19.031
in the.

05:27.531 --> 05:28.631
That's clean, yeah?
Yeah.

05:28.631 --> 05:30.000
It's the cleanest
I've ever seen it.

05:30.000 --> 05:31.365
It's the cleanest
I've ever seen it.

05:31.365 --> 05:34.698
Luis, okay, we start
firing up again now, yes?

05:34.698 --> 05:36.698
Everybody was pitching in
to save the dinner service.

05:36.698 --> 05:39.031
Lisa disappeared to the loo.

05:39.031 --> 05:41.565
In fact, she stayed in there
all freaking night

05:41.565 --> 05:42.865
until that last customer left.

05:42.865 --> 05:47.431
How embarrassing is that?

05:47.431 --> 05:49.731
Is that the kind of trick
that they teach you

05:49.731 --> 05:51.031
in an honor's degree,

05:51.031 --> 05:54.398
to disappear in the toilet?

05:54.398 --> 05:56.198
That's not the way
to face problems.

05:56.198 --> 05:57.598
What was I supposed to do?

05:57.598 --> 05:59.231
Like, what?

05:59.231 --> 06:00.000
Do you want me to go back
and dust?

06:00.000 --> 06:00.731
Do you want me to go back
and dust?

06:00.731 --> 06:02.098
Like, I don't get what you're
trying to say now.

06:02.098 --> 06:03.098
You don't get it.
Okay.

06:03.098 --> 06:05.198
So no one's ever told
you the truth,

06:05.198 --> 06:10.631
but more importantly,
I think you're in denial.

06:10.631 --> 06:12.231
Why am I here?

06:12.231 --> 06:13.731
Because we need help

06:13.731 --> 06:16.131
and I'm missing
a key ingredient, obviously.

06:16.131 --> 06:18.098
Tomorrow, new start.

06:22.531 --> 06:25.398
Up until that point,
Lisa hadn't given me one reason

06:25.398 --> 06:26.865
for me to believe in her.

06:26.865 --> 06:29.298
But the next day,
she honestly surprised me.

06:29.298 --> 06:30.000
Things that I would like
to change about Lido today.

06:30.000 --> 06:32.031
Things that I would like
to change about Lido today.

06:32.031 --> 06:33.098
Mm-hmm.

06:33.098 --> 06:34.265
Be proud of the food
we're serving.

06:34.265 --> 06:36.431
Keep a clean and sanitary
environment.

06:36.431 --> 06:39.565
Learn how
the kitchen operates.

06:39.565 --> 06:41.565
Tonight, you--
yeah, here we are--

06:41.565 --> 06:43.598
are on the line.

06:43.598 --> 06:46.065
That's right.Yeah.

06:46.065 --> 06:47.765
Are you serious?

06:47.765 --> 06:49.098
I'm very serious.

06:49.098 --> 06:51.798
It became so obvious
so quickly

06:51.798 --> 06:54.698
that Lisa had never spent time
in a kitchen before.

06:54.698 --> 06:56.465
How ridiculous is that?

06:56.465 --> 06:57.698
Lisa, get comfortable with it,
yeah?

06:57.698 --> 06:59.065
Yeah.
Get comfortable.

06:59.065 --> 07:00.000
Why is this not turning on?

07:00.000 --> 07:00.765
Why is this not turning on?

07:00.765 --> 07:02.865
This is hot.
I don't know what to do with it.

07:02.865 --> 07:03.898
Keep it here?

07:03.898 --> 07:05.598
Whoa!

07:05.598 --> 07:09.031
Why is it flaming?

07:09.031 --> 07:11.431
Okay, Lisa may never be a chef.
got it.

07:11.431 --> 07:15.065
But at least she started showing
interest in the food.

07:15.065 --> 07:17.065
Why isn't it going
in there?

07:17.065 --> 07:18.898
I think
it's a very valid point.

07:18.898 --> 07:20.298
Why is it going
in the microwave?

07:20.298 --> 07:21.765
Why can't it go--
the oven's on?

07:21.765 --> 07:23.431
Yeah, it's on.

07:23.431 --> 07:24.431
Can you see what
I'm trying to say?

07:24.431 --> 07:27.431
It's really important
for you to see this.

07:27.431 --> 07:29.365
Dinner service did have
its ups and downs,

07:29.365 --> 07:30.000
but I did like what I've seen
coming out of Lisa.

07:30.000 --> 07:31.898
but I did like what I've seen
coming out of Lisa.

07:31.898 --> 07:37.398
And that night,
we transformed Lido.

07:37.398 --> 07:38.531
Ahh!
Come in. Come in. Come in.

07:38.531 --> 07:39.398
Wow!
Whoa!

07:39.398 --> 07:40.431
Come in.

07:40.431 --> 07:42.531
Oh, my God. Wow.

07:42.531 --> 07:43.898
It's beautiful.

07:43.898 --> 07:46.131
Was dividingous wall that

07:46.131 --> 07:47.798
your restaurant has gone.

07:47.798 --> 07:49.865
Now the whole thing just
feels open.

07:49.865 --> 07:52.865
And one thing you've got
every chance at succeeding in

07:52.865 --> 07:57.098
is becoming Manhattan's,
yeah, local, cool...

07:57.098 --> 07:59.565
wine bar.

07:59.565 --> 08:00.000
Serving great food,
great wines by the glasses.

08:00.000 --> 08:01.965
Serving great food,
great wines by the glasses.

08:01.965 --> 08:03.365
More importantly,

08:03.365 --> 08:05.865
a very cool place
to hang out.

08:05.865 --> 08:07.965
Everybody was so excited
with the new menu.

08:07.965 --> 08:10.231
Homemade chicken sausage.
Grilled baby artichokes.

08:10.231 --> 08:11.731
One of my favorites,
the flatbreads.

08:11.731 --> 08:12.965
They are fantastic.

08:12.965 --> 08:15.298
And the energy levels
for relaunch night

08:15.298 --> 08:17.465
was at an all-time high.

08:17.465 --> 08:19.565
One, two, three.
Lido.

08:19.565 --> 08:20.565
Lido!
Lido!

08:20.565 --> 08:23.198
Whoo!
Let's do it.

08:23.198 --> 08:25.131
Welcome to the new Lido.

08:25.131 --> 08:27.098
Thank you.
Enjoy some wine tonight.

08:27.098 --> 08:29.598
But it didn't take long for all
hell to break loose.

08:29.598 --> 08:30.000
I'm begging you just
to talk to each other.

08:30.000 --> 08:31.465
I'm begging you just
to talk to each other.

08:31.465 --> 08:33.365
Arturo,
will you please tell her

08:33.365 --> 08:34.631
to make some food?

08:34.631 --> 08:36.865
Lisa, I'm trying right now.
I can't do my stuff too.

08:36.865 --> 08:39.131
And then the unthinkable
happened.

08:42.398 --> 08:45.931
The entire kitchen team
disappeared.

08:45.931 --> 08:47.531
Oh, my God.

08:47.531 --> 08:48.598
Hello?
We giving up. Bye.

08:48.598 --> 08:50.098
Arturo!
We giving up, sir.

08:50.098 --> 08:51.565
Yeah, I know you're giving up.
Okay?

08:51.565 --> 08:53.365
Why?

08:53.365 --> 08:55.031
Is this what they do?

08:55.031 --> 08:56.565
Luis!
Luis!

08:56.565 --> 08:59.565
Never seen that ever before
in my entire cooking career.

08:59.565 --> 09:00.000
I called Scott,

09:00.000 --> 09:01.398
I called Scott,

09:01.398 --> 09:02.765
one of the best chefs
I know.

09:02.765 --> 09:04.531
Jump in the car and get down
here quickly,

09:04.531 --> 09:05.598
will you, please?

09:05.598 --> 09:08.365
But without the staff,
we were toast.

09:08.365 --> 09:09.465
Hey, Luis!

09:09.465 --> 09:12.531
I begged them to come back
for Lisa.

09:14.431 --> 09:16.265
This is music to my ears.

09:16.265 --> 09:17.265
Moments later, Scott arrived.

09:17.265 --> 09:19.198
Scott's here.

09:19.198 --> 09:20.198
Let's get this back together,
yes?

09:20.198 --> 09:21.298
Listen up, everybody.

09:21.298 --> 09:22.865
I need a prosciutto pizza
in the oven.

09:22.865 --> 09:24.731
I need a lamb sandwich up top
right now.

09:24.731 --> 09:26.398
For 106.
Thank you.

09:26.398 --> 09:28.398
Yay!

09:28.398 --> 09:29.398
Excellent.

09:29.398 --> 09:30.000
That's good.

09:30.000 --> 09:30.931
That's good.

09:30.931 --> 09:32.265
It wasn't perfect,

09:32.265 --> 09:34.131
But we did manage
to save the night.

09:34.131 --> 09:38.431
More importantly,
I now believed in Lisa.

09:38.431 --> 09:41.131
You have seriously grown up
this week

09:41.131 --> 09:43.698
more than I ever expected
you to do.

09:43.698 --> 09:44.931
I seriously believe in you.

09:44.931 --> 09:46.431
Thank you.

09:46.431 --> 09:47.431
I can't wait to come back.

09:47.431 --> 09:48.931
Can't wait to have you back.

09:48.931 --> 09:50.431
I'll be your honor student.

09:50.431 --> 09:51.931
Good night.
Well done, my darling.

09:51.931 --> 09:53.598
Yeah, well done.
Thank you so much.

09:53.598 --> 09:58.465
Good luck.
Spend time in that kitchen.

09:58.465 --> 10:00.000
I'm back at Lido
in Manhattan Beach.

10:00.000 --> 10:00.798
I'm back at Lido
in Manhattan Beach.

10:00.798 --> 10:02.865
Now, last time I was here,
the owner spent more time

10:02.865 --> 10:04.731
in the bathroom than she did
in the kitchen.

10:04.731 --> 10:06.931
Has she grown up and turned
her business around?

10:06.931 --> 10:08.631
We're about to find out.

10:08.631 --> 10:11.398
Coming up, has Lido's passed
Chef Ramsay's test...

10:11.398 --> 10:13.265
I've never done this before.
You know that?

10:13.265 --> 10:16.465
Or is the business back
in the toilet?

10:16.465 --> 10:19.465
Then, remember Anna Vincenzo's
in Boca Raton?

10:19.465 --> 10:22.531
Cece the owner fought
with Chef Ramsay at every turn.

10:22.531 --> 10:23.898
Okay, so you want me to be
your  puppet--

10:23.898 --> 10:25.131
Why are you shouting?

10:25.131 --> 10:26.598
Because you're pissing me
the  off.

10:26.598 --> 10:28.298
Now Chef Ramsay's back

10:28.298 --> 10:29.565
and he and Cece
go at it again.

10:29.565 --> 10:30.000
I'm sat in front of a lady
that doesn't really

10:30.000 --> 10:30.931
I'm sat in front of a lady
that doesn't really

10:30.931 --> 10:32.565
give a toss
about the restaurant.

10:32.565 --> 10:35.531
You don't wanna
miss this reunion.

10:35.531 --> 10:38.031
Coming up on Kitchen Nightmares
Revisited.

10:42.464 --> 10:43.798
Lido's was run by a young,

10:43.798 --> 10:44.864
Laid-back Californian.

10:44.864 --> 10:46.098
I don't want
to hear complaints.

10:46.098 --> 10:48.864
I don't want to hear.
I just want to hang out.

10:48.864 --> 10:50.564
Lisa was not only friends
with her employees...

10:50.564 --> 10:52.098
Do you have his
phone number?

10:52.098 --> 10:54.198
She was hooking up
with the bartender.

10:54.198 --> 10:59.298
It's probably a bad idea,
but I'm gonna do it anyways.

10:59.298 --> 11:02.798
And when Chef Ramsay wanted Lisa
to face the cold, hard truth...

11:02.798 --> 11:04.098
Grow up, Lisa, will you?

11:04.098 --> 11:05.864
She fell apart
and went into hiding.

11:05.864 --> 11:06.798
Where is Lisa?
Has she gone upstairs?

11:06.798 --> 11:08.198
She's in the restroom,
yeah.

11:08.198 --> 11:10.473
She's in the restroom?

11:10.473 --> 11:11.731
She's in the restroom?

11:11.731 --> 11:13.598
Chef Ramsay transformed
the restaurant

11:13.598 --> 11:16.764
and finally got Lisa to act
like a responsible owner

11:16.764 --> 11:18.798
and less like a party girl.

11:18.798 --> 11:22.631
Now one year later,
is Lido's on the path to success

11:22.631 --> 11:25.698
or on the road to failure?

11:25.698 --> 11:29.098
Last time I was at Lido,
the owner Lisa

11:29.098 --> 11:30.864
didn't have a clue
how to run a business.

11:30.864 --> 11:33.398
The food was rotten,
the kitchen was filthy dirty,

11:33.398 --> 11:34.864
and she couldn't understand
to why customers

11:34.864 --> 11:36.198
weren't showing up.

11:36.198 --> 11:39.298
I'm dying to see how her
business is doing now.

11:39.298 --> 11:40.473
Brace myself.

11:40.473 --> 11:40.864
Brace myself.

11:40.864 --> 11:41.964
Hello.

11:41.964 --> 11:43.598
Hey!
How are you, my darling?

11:43.598 --> 11:44.931
Good.
Good to see you well.

11:44.931 --> 11:47.731
What a surprise.
Likewise.
Good to see you too.

11:47.731 --> 11:48.931
God, the atmosphere here
is amazing.

11:48.931 --> 11:50.098
Really good.

11:50.098 --> 11:51.098
There's one person I can't see.

11:51.098 --> 11:52.131
Where is she?

11:52.131 --> 11:55.698
I think she's
in the restroom.

11:55.698 --> 11:59.898
Oh, please.
You're kidding me.

11:59.898 --> 12:01.398
She's in the bathroom?
Yes.

12:01.398 --> 12:03.898
Can I have a word with her?
Let me get her.

12:03.898 --> 12:05.464
Thank you.

12:05.464 --> 12:08.198
Lisa?

12:08.198 --> 12:09.364
Hey.
Hey, what's up?

12:09.364 --> 12:10.473
So we have a visitor.

12:10.473 --> 12:10.764
So we have a visitor.

12:10.764 --> 12:12.531
Oh, my gosh.

12:12.531 --> 12:13.731
,
how are you?

12:13.731 --> 12:15.264
Where have you been?
Good to see you, darling.

12:15.264 --> 12:17.431
Good to see you too.
Likewise.
Good to see you too.

12:17.431 --> 12:18.698
My goodness me.
You look great.

12:18.698 --> 12:20.431
Thank you.
You too.

12:20.431 --> 12:22.464
This place is amazing.
I know.
Packed house.

12:22.464 --> 12:24.398
Unbelievable.
Thank you.

12:24.398 --> 12:26.898
Trust you to be
in the bathroom.

12:26.898 --> 12:32.231
Where is Lisa?

12:32.231 --> 12:35.231
You know, you got to go to
the restroom once in a while.

12:35.231 --> 12:36.964
He just has bad timing.

12:36.964 --> 12:38.364
Well, that was just
a general break.

12:38.364 --> 12:39.864
That was a coincidence.
No one's pissed you off?

12:39.864 --> 12:40.473
No, no, no, no, no.
Okay, good.

12:40.473 --> 12:41.431
No, no, no, no, no.
Okay, good.

12:41.431 --> 12:42.598
How's things?

12:42.598 --> 12:44.964
Things have actually been
really good.

12:44.964 --> 12:47.864
I seriously took to heart
everything that you said.

12:47.864 --> 12:50.264
I wanted to be your A-plus
student when you came back.

12:50.264 --> 12:52.264
Have you stuck to the plan?
I've stuck to the plan.

12:52.264 --> 12:53.664
Yeah?

12:53.664 --> 12:54.798
I got to learn all
of the recipes.

12:54.798 --> 12:56.764
Got to know how
the kitchen operates.

12:56.764 --> 12:57.964
We've gotten great
cleaning habits.

12:57.964 --> 12:59.431
That's brilliant.

12:59.431 --> 13:02.065
Oh, I wanted you to taste
the mushroom flatbread

13:02.065 --> 13:03.398
that you inspired.

13:03.398 --> 13:04.432
Okay.
It's one of my favorites.

13:04.432 --> 13:05.998
I'm kind of addicted to it.

13:05.998 --> 13:07.865
That looks amazing.
Thank you, my darling.

13:07.865 --> 13:09.332
It's the, um,
wild mushroom,

13:09.332 --> 13:10.473
spinach, ricotta cheese,
mozzarella.

13:10.473 --> 13:12.432
spinach, ricotta cheese,
mozzarella.

13:12.432 --> 13:13.565
That's delicious.

13:13.565 --> 13:15.732
Thank you.
I'm glad you like it.

13:15.732 --> 13:17.398
I wanted to make him proud
and I wanted to do

13:17.398 --> 13:20.098
the absolute best I could,
so I've been looking forward

13:20.098 --> 13:21.332
to this day for a long time.

13:21.332 --> 13:24.398
The business in terms
of over the last 12 months,

13:24.398 --> 13:25.398
where are we?

13:25.398 --> 13:27.065
I would say we're up
about 20%,

13:27.065 --> 13:30.598
which puts me at about
a nice profitability.

13:30.598 --> 13:31.998
Wow.
That's fantastic news.

13:31.998 --> 13:34.598
So, um, where's
your boyfriend Damien gone?

13:34.598 --> 13:35.698
Is Lisa a good boss?

13:35.698 --> 13:36.865
Lisa is a lovely boss.

13:36.865 --> 13:38.398
Sounds like it's
an intimate lovely.

13:38.398 --> 13:39.865
I am dating Lisa, yes.

13:39.865 --> 13:40.473
Okay.

13:40.473 --> 13:40.932
Okay.

13:40.932 --> 13:42.665
Who cares?

13:44.098 --> 13:46.232
He was out of here about
a week after you left.

13:46.232 --> 13:48.032
I really followed
your advice.

13:48.032 --> 13:49.232
I'm telling you.

13:49.232 --> 13:50.998
Well, I didn't tell you
to fire your boyfriend.

13:50.998 --> 13:52.565
Well, kind of.

13:52.565 --> 13:53.932
But--did I?

13:53.932 --> 13:55.865
It was a great thing.
Amazing thing.

13:55.865 --> 13:58.265
I would never date
an employee again ever,

13:58.265 --> 14:00.998
ever, ever, never ever.

14:00.998 --> 14:02.532
Let's go back 12 months.

14:02.532 --> 14:04.165
Um, worst moment?
The dust.

14:04.165 --> 14:06.732
Are you interested in being
served dinner with that filth

14:06.732 --> 14:09.532
dripping in your food?

14:09.532 --> 14:10.473
Does anyone want to eat now?

14:10.473 --> 14:11.432
Does anyone want to eat now?

14:11.432 --> 14:12.532
Mm-mmm.

14:12.532 --> 14:14.098
I think you're a jerk.

14:14.098 --> 14:15.498
Did you really hate me
that much?

14:15.498 --> 14:16.698
I really hated you
that much.

14:16.698 --> 14:17.832
I really did.

14:17.832 --> 14:19.565
On a scale of one to ten?

14:19.565 --> 14:20.665
10, 11 maybe.

14:20.665 --> 14:22.165
10? 11?
Wow.
Yeah.

14:22.165 --> 14:23.398
So low.
That's amazing.

14:23.398 --> 14:24.932
I know.
You're amazing,

14:24.932 --> 14:25.998
because somehow
you turned me around.

14:25.998 --> 14:26.932
Now I love you.

14:29.665 --> 14:30.998
Oh, well,
I guess excuse me for a moment.

14:30.998 --> 14:32.165
Well, Lisa,
don't let me stop you.

14:32.165 --> 14:33.332
The fact that you're running
your business,

14:33.332 --> 14:34.765
I'm so happy.
Thank you.

14:34.765 --> 14:37.865
Huh?

14:37.865 --> 14:39.865
I've taken definitely more
of a leadership role,

14:39.865 --> 14:40.473
especially in the kitchen.

14:40.473 --> 14:41.665
especially in the kitchen.

14:41.665 --> 14:43.932
I feel much more comfortable
walking back

14:43.932 --> 14:48.532
and talking to Luis and making
sure it's done right.

14:48.532 --> 14:50.998
Can I just say--
look, it's shining here!

14:50.998 --> 14:52.232
It is,
isn't it?
Huh?

14:52.232 --> 14:53.998
You want to bring
the customers back now?

14:53.998 --> 14:54.998
I don't want to bring
the customers.

14:54.998 --> 14:56.665
I want to bring out
my white glove, okay?

14:56.665 --> 14:58.198
I just want to--
never done this before.

14:58.198 --> 15:00.032
You know that?

15:00.032 --> 15:01.698
Last time,
you got pissy with me.

15:01.698 --> 15:03.998
This is above food.

15:03.998 --> 15:05.732
I mean, come on.

15:05.732 --> 15:07.932
I don't think it really
has affected

15:07.932 --> 15:09.698
or gone in the food.

15:09.698 --> 15:10.473
How do you know?

15:10.473 --> 15:12.165
How do you know?

15:12.165 --> 15:13.732
All right,
let's hope we did good.

15:13.732 --> 15:15.365
Spotless.

15:15.365 --> 15:16.932
Yay.
Absolutely spotless.

15:16.932 --> 15:18.365
Well done.
Thank you.

15:18.365 --> 15:21.165
Since he's been gone,
we have a lot of customers

15:21.165 --> 15:22.932
come in and ask about it.

15:22.932 --> 15:25.265
So I gladly take them back
and show 'em

15:25.265 --> 15:27.865
how clean we keep everything.

15:27.865 --> 15:30.865
I have one other thing that I
have to kind of show off to you.

15:30.865 --> 15:32.998
Since you inspired
my wine bar,

15:32.998 --> 15:34.765
I came out with my own
Lido brand wines.

15:34.765 --> 15:36.265
You're kidding me.

15:36.265 --> 15:37.498
No.
Thank you.

15:37.498 --> 15:38.498
We shouldn't be drinking
at lunchtime.

15:38.498 --> 15:39.498
However--
so what is this?

15:39.498 --> 15:40.473
Special occasion.

15:40.473 --> 15:40.598
Special occasion.

15:40.598 --> 15:41.832
This is the Pinot noir.

15:41.832 --> 15:42.898
That's lovely.
Cheers, darling.

15:42.898 --> 15:44.998
House Pinot.

15:44.998 --> 15:46.765
Mmm.
That's lovely.

15:46.765 --> 15:47.765
One more thing.

15:47.765 --> 15:48.765
I have a favor
to ask of you.

15:48.765 --> 15:49.932
You're full of it today.

15:49.932 --> 15:51.098
I'm full of it today.

15:51.098 --> 15:52.165
Can you help me
make a dish...

15:52.165 --> 15:53.165
You got me a present?

15:53.165 --> 15:55.032
You want me to cook
for you now?

15:55.032 --> 15:56.032
To go with that,
please?

15:56.032 --> 15:57.498
You've become demanding.

15:57.498 --> 15:59.498
I think he thought
I might have been

15:59.498 --> 16:02.865
a little bit bossy or I asked
a little bit too much,

16:02.865 --> 16:05.198
but, you know, he wanted me
to take the reins.

16:05.198 --> 16:07.732
Let me get that chef's jacket
you got me last time.

16:07.732 --> 16:08.832
Tonight, you--

16:08.832 --> 16:10.473
yeah,
here we are--

16:10.473 --> 16:10.832
yeah,
here we are--

16:10.832 --> 16:13.998
are on the line.
That's right.

16:13.998 --> 16:16.398
Be your sous chef today.

16:16.398 --> 16:18.932
You're smart
in your old age.

16:18.932 --> 16:20.998
Right, let's do some
pan-seared duck

16:20.998 --> 16:22.532
with a cherry mustardo sauce

16:22.532 --> 16:25.098
with chanterelles
and braised shallots.

16:25.098 --> 16:27.998
Will you grab Luis for me?

16:27.998 --> 16:29.932
How are you,
Mr. Happy Man?

16:29.932 --> 16:31.665
Good to see you.
Welcome back.

16:31.665 --> 16:36.598
So, duck.
Cook it skin side down.

16:36.598 --> 16:40.032
Now, the duck,
just slice it nice and thick,

16:40.032 --> 16:40.473
so the goodness stays
in there.

16:40.473 --> 16:41.565
so the goodness stays
in there.

16:41.565 --> 16:43.365
Now sauce.

16:43.365 --> 16:44.865
Scatter the cherries around.

16:44.865 --> 16:46.898
Now the bad news is
you can't taste it.

16:46.898 --> 16:48.232
I know.

16:48.232 --> 16:49.432
I'm proud of being
a vegetarian,

16:49.432 --> 16:50.898
but it did smell delicious.

16:50.898 --> 16:52.332
Who's the chief taster?

16:52.332 --> 16:53.865
Bruna.
Yes!

16:53.865 --> 16:55.498
Bruna, right.

16:55.498 --> 16:58.032
Bruna came and tried the food.

16:58.032 --> 16:59.265
You could just tell
by her facial expression

16:59.265 --> 17:01.065
that it was fabulous.

17:01.065 --> 17:02.532
Amazing.

17:02.532 --> 17:04.098
Oh.
Thank you.

17:04.098 --> 17:05.432
Bless you.

17:05.432 --> 17:08.998
The biggest thing
I've learned from Gordon

17:08.998 --> 17:10.473
is to get back in the kitchen,
be confident

17:10.473 --> 17:10.598
is to get back in the kitchen,
be confident

17:10.598 --> 17:12.832
in taking the reins
of the whole entire operation

17:12.832 --> 17:13.898
of the restaurant.

17:13.898 --> 17:14.932
I'm very thankful.

17:14.932 --> 17:16.698
Darling, keep up the good work.

17:16.698 --> 17:17.865
Thank you.
Yes.

17:17.865 --> 17:18.998
I want to give you
a token here.

17:18.998 --> 17:20.165
You're giving me a present?

17:20.165 --> 17:21.432
Yes, this is our
single-vineyard Pinot.

17:21.432 --> 17:22.765
How wonderful.

17:22.765 --> 17:23.998
The experience overall
was priceless

17:23.998 --> 17:25.865
and I'd do it again
in a heartbeat.

17:25.865 --> 17:27.432
Thank you for everything.
Yes, well done.

17:27.432 --> 17:28.832
Thank you.
Take care.

17:28.832 --> 17:32.899
Thank you, bye.

17:32.899 --> 17:35.199
Wow. It's like night
and day in there.

17:35.199 --> 17:36.732
And Lisa's gone
from an immature kid

17:36.732 --> 17:38.565
to a very savvy
businesswoman.

17:38.565 --> 17:40.165
And if she can turn
her business around

17:40.165 --> 17:40.473
and increase sales by 20%
in the midst of a recession,

17:40.473 --> 17:44.165
and increase sales by 20%
in the midst of a recession,

17:44.165 --> 17:46.899
then trust me,
sky's the limit for Lido's.

17:46.899 --> 17:49.665
Beautiful.

17:49.665 --> 17:52.399
Coming up, we return
to Anna Vincenzo's

17:52.399 --> 17:54.432
in Boca Raton, Florida,
where Cece,

17:54.432 --> 17:58.232
an unstable owner,
had regular temper tantrums...

17:58.232 --> 17:59.232
Tell everybody
to  go home.

17:59.232 --> 18:00.732
I'm shutting the place down.

18:00.732 --> 18:02.365
And frequent
emotional breakdowns.

18:04.232 --> 18:05.565
Now, one year later,

18:05.565 --> 18:07.832
Chef Ramsay is in
for the shock of the year.

18:07.832 --> 18:09.599
Holy crap.
What happened?

18:09.599 --> 18:10.473
And later, who can forget Andy,

18:10.473 --> 18:11.599
And later, who can forget Andy,

18:11.599 --> 18:13.332
The hot-headed owner
from Le Bistro?

18:13.332 --> 18:14.899
Don't you  go there.

18:14.899 --> 18:16.165
You won't want to miss
what happens

18:16.165 --> 18:17.999
When Gordon and Andy
are together again.

18:17.999 --> 18:20.199
I can still sense
stubbornness in you.

18:20.199 --> 18:22.032
You know that?

18:22.032 --> 18:23.840
Kitchen Nightmares Revisited.

18:28.362 --> 18:31.029
Boca Raton, Florida.

18:31.029 --> 18:32.962
To most people,
a wealthy beach town

18:32.962 --> 18:35.296
just one hour north of Miami.

18:35.296 --> 18:39.029
But when I think of Boca,
I only think of one thing.

18:39.029 --> 18:39.862
Cece!

18:39.862 --> 18:41.562
Here's your!

18:41.562 --> 18:42.562
Tell everybody to
go home.

18:42.562 --> 18:44.029
I'm shutting
the place down.

18:44.029 --> 18:45.229
She was a real piece of work.

18:45.229 --> 18:47.362
And in between
her temper tantrums...

18:47.362 --> 18:48.562
Okay, forget it.

18:48.562 --> 18:49.895
Let's go to another
table.

18:49.895 --> 18:51.162
And her crying fits...

18:51.162 --> 18:53.062
There's, like,
nobody  coming here

18:53.062 --> 18:54.362
and five tables we have,
like,

18:54.362 --> 18:55.471
everything's  up.

18:55.471 --> 18:55.529
everything's  up.

18:55.529 --> 18:57.295
She was driving her restaurant,

18:57.295 --> 19:00.829
Anna Vincenzo's,
straight into bankruptcy.

19:00.829 --> 19:02.029
I'm a failure.

19:02.029 --> 19:05.295
I'm afraid we're gonna
lose our house.

19:05.295 --> 19:06.729
I have, like,
a weight on my shoulders

19:06.729 --> 19:09.329
that, you know,
weighs 1,000 pounds.

19:09.329 --> 19:11.829
Cece's dad Angelo,

19:11.829 --> 19:15.629
he lent his daughter 300,000
bucks to get her started.

19:15.629 --> 19:17.229
Now he's working for her.

19:17.229 --> 19:19.495
I stay up at night
just thinking,

19:19.495 --> 19:21.129
"How am I gonna
give him his money?"

19:21.129 --> 19:23.062
Michael!
Yes?

19:23.062 --> 19:24.195
And her husband Michael,

19:24.195 --> 19:25.471
The head server,
he was too scared

19:25.471 --> 19:25.695
The head server,
he was too scared

19:25.695 --> 19:27.062
to say a word to her.

19:27.062 --> 19:28.195
Here's your salmon divino salad.

19:28.195 --> 19:29.362
Thank you.

19:29.362 --> 19:32.329
That is, until I arrived
and tasted her bloody cooking.

19:32.329 --> 19:35.195
That has to be Florida's
worst dish ever.

19:35.195 --> 19:36.695
If he complains about this,
I'm really gonna

19:36.695 --> 19:38.062
kick his ass.

19:38.062 --> 19:40.462
This one looks like a,
uh, dog's dinner.

19:40.462 --> 19:42.962
So he is a bigger
than I thought.

19:42.962 --> 19:44.895
Just taste that for me,
would you?

19:44.895 --> 19:47.062
That's the snapper Anna.

19:47.062 --> 19:48.129
It's soggy.

19:48.129 --> 19:49.129
Should be baked a little longer.

19:49.129 --> 19:50.695
It's  disgusting.

19:50.695 --> 19:52.329
Yes, sir.

19:52.329 --> 19:53.495
- him.
- him?

19:53.495 --> 19:54.862
Chef Ramsay.

19:54.862 --> 19:55.471
Surprised nobody
break his legs yet.

19:55.471 --> 19:58.295
Surprised nobody
break his legs yet.

19:58.295 --> 19:59.829
After my disgusting lunch,

19:59.829 --> 20:02.629
I headed into the kitchen
to confront Cece.

20:02.629 --> 20:03.962
You didn't taste the snapper?

20:03.962 --> 20:05.029
I'm not gonna eat something
off your plate.

20:05.029 --> 20:06.162
Where's Michael?

20:06.162 --> 20:08.062
What difference does it make
where  Michael is?

20:08.062 --> 20:09.062
He's got nothing
to do with this.

20:09.062 --> 20:10.662
He tasted it.
And what did he say?

20:10.662 --> 20:11.729
He said it was mush.

20:11.729 --> 20:13.229
Are you  kidding me?

20:13.229 --> 20:14.362
Where is he?

20:14.362 --> 20:15.362
You said the
fish was mush?

20:15.362 --> 20:16.895
No, it was tender,

20:16.895 --> 20:17.895
the way everybody else
enjoys it.

20:17.895 --> 20:19.129
There.
It was tender.

20:19.129 --> 20:20.162
Michael, are you honestly
trying to tell me

20:20.162 --> 20:21.729
that you're now saying

20:21.729 --> 20:22.795
that was perfectly cooked?

20:22.795 --> 20:24.062
What a joke.

20:24.062 --> 20:25.471
A bunch of yes men
telling Madame

20:25.471 --> 20:25.895
A bunch of yes men
telling Madame

20:25.895 --> 20:27.029
exactly what she wants to hear.

20:27.029 --> 20:28.129
Come on.

20:28.129 --> 20:29.195
So you want me to be your
puppet--

20:29.195 --> 20:30.462
Why are you shouting?

20:30.462 --> 20:32.162
Because you're pissing me
the  off.

20:32.162 --> 20:33.962
So shut the  up
and talk properly.

20:33.962 --> 20:35.195
Oh, you're gonna get your
ass kicked.

20:35.195 --> 20:36.562
Oh, there you go.

20:36.562 --> 20:37.562
I'm not too sure which
is worse.

20:37.562 --> 20:39.029
The food or the attitude.

20:39.029 --> 20:40.195
Ooh, can I hit him now?

20:40.195 --> 20:41.995
Can you say, "unstable"?

20:41.995 --> 20:43.295
A lot of people said
you were a jerk.

20:43.295 --> 20:44.395
I think I believe it.

20:44.395 --> 20:46.029
That night,
I thought I was coming

20:46.029 --> 20:47.295
To observe dinner service.

20:47.295 --> 20:48.562
Instead,
I got a front-row seat

20:48.562 --> 20:52.862
to witness a complete emotional
breakdown.

20:52.862 --> 20:54.462
Can I get some
servers back here?

20:55.462 --> 20:55.471
The veal has no flavor at all.

20:55.471 --> 20:56.962
The veal has no flavor at all.

20:56.962 --> 20:58.495
They just say
it's no flavor,

20:58.495 --> 20:59.795
but they're willing
to let you try

20:59.795 --> 21:02.129
to put some flavor in it,
like garlic--

21:02.129 --> 21:03.629
No, I just don't want to put
nothing in it.

21:03.629 --> 21:04.829
Cece was the queen.

21:04.829 --> 21:07.129
The queen of bland frozen
cuisine.

21:07.129 --> 21:08.729
It was no surprise food
was coming back

21:08.729 --> 21:10.129
time and time again.

21:10.129 --> 21:12.029
I need this reduced down
a little more

21:12.029 --> 21:13.195
and add
a little more flavor.

21:13.195 --> 21:14.495
Michael, you know what?

21:14.495 --> 21:15.895
I'm ready to tell everybody
just to leave.

21:15.895 --> 21:17.295
Just don't even want
to hear it right now.

21:17.295 --> 21:19.195
Well, you can't just act
like a precious princess.

21:19.195 --> 21:21.562
Yeah, I look like a
princess, right?

21:21.562 --> 21:23.362
Sorry, I thought this
was your restaurant.

21:23.362 --> 21:25.471
I think princess Diana didn't
hang out in the  kitchen.

21:25.471 --> 21:26.295
I think princess Diana didn't
hang out in the  kitchen.

21:26.295 --> 21:28.195
She's from your neck
of the woods, isn't she?

21:28.195 --> 21:29.395
Wow.

21:29.395 --> 21:31.129
I'm done.
What do you mean you're done?

21:31.129 --> 21:32.362
Everything's
coming back.

21:32.362 --> 21:34.662
Why do I stand here and
keep cooking for nothing?

21:34.662 --> 21:37.229
I've had chefs quit
on me before,

21:37.229 --> 21:38.829
but not when they've owned
the damn restaurant.

21:40.695 --> 21:42.495
Are you gonna be all right
or are you gonna pass out?

21:42.495 --> 21:44.162
I can't get my breath.

21:44.162 --> 21:46.529
Michael and I got behind
the line to finish up service.

21:46.529 --> 21:48.862
Afterwards,
I decided it was time

21:48.862 --> 21:51.529
for Cece and I to have
a serious heart-to-heart.

21:57.562 --> 21:59.495
It's not a joke for me.

21:59.495 --> 22:00.795
I care.

22:00.795 --> 22:02.195
If I didn't care,
I wouldn't  be here,

22:02.195 --> 22:04.695
So stop just saying
I don't care.

22:04.695 --> 22:06.162
Just stop, please.

22:06.162 --> 22:08.029
I haven't said that.

22:08.029 --> 22:09.129
Yes, you did.

22:09.129 --> 22:10.229
It's not a sign
of weakness

22:10.229 --> 22:11.362
to admit
your failings.

22:11.362 --> 22:12.795
I've closed
three restaurants,

22:12.795 --> 22:15.395
but also have a number
of successful ones

22:15.395 --> 22:16.795
and 1,615 members.

22:16.795 --> 22:19.195
I know who you are,
and it's--it's--

22:19.195 --> 22:21.195
Yeah, a jerk.
You told me earlier.

22:21.195 --> 22:22.729
Well,
you can be a jerk.

22:22.729 --> 22:24.895
Stop acting
like a petulant teenager.

22:24.895 --> 22:25.471
You asked me here,

22:25.471 --> 22:26.295
You asked me here,

22:26.295 --> 22:28.829
and I'm here to help,
so let me in.

22:28.829 --> 22:31.029
Okay, the food sucks.

22:31.029 --> 22:32.829
There, you happy?

22:32.829 --> 22:34.362
Finally, a breakthrough!

22:34.362 --> 22:37.462
Thank God!

22:37.462 --> 22:39.362
New day tomorrow,
okay?

22:39.362 --> 22:41.229
We start to rebuild.

22:41.229 --> 22:43.395
I'm sorry
I called you names.

22:43.395 --> 22:44.962
Let's go. Up.

22:44.962 --> 22:48.329
Now that Cece was finally

22:48.329 --> 22:49.329
accepting responsibility,

22:49.329 --> 22:50.329
my team and I swept in

22:50.329 --> 22:53.529
and completely transformed
Anna Vincenzo's.

22:53.529 --> 22:55.471
Welcome to the new
Anna Vincenzo's.

22:55.471 --> 22:56.829
Welcome to the new
Anna Vincenzo's.

22:56.829 --> 22:59.195
Look at the space
created.

22:59.195 --> 23:00.662
Oh, my God.

23:00.662 --> 23:02.295
It's so bright
and beautiful!

23:02.295 --> 23:05.195
Dark, sedated colors.

23:05.195 --> 23:07.129
We've got lightness.

23:07.129 --> 23:09.229
It's contemporary,
and it's timeless.

23:10.329 --> 23:11.895
You happy?
Yes.

23:11.895 --> 23:13.329
Angelo, you happy?

23:13.329 --> 23:14.995
My daughter happy,
so I'm happy.

23:14.995 --> 23:16.162
Good.
And what do you think?

23:16.162 --> 23:19.662
Beautiful.
God bless you.

23:19.662 --> 23:21.162
Next, the food.

23:21.162 --> 23:24.329
Cece's old menu
had 181 dishes on it.

23:24.329 --> 23:25.471
181!

23:25.471 --> 23:26.229
181!

23:26.229 --> 23:28.462
Then I got rid
of all the frozen crap

23:28.462 --> 23:31.195
and turned Anna Vincenzo's

23:31.195 --> 23:34.029
into a quality
family restaurant.

23:34.029 --> 23:36.162
Okay, let's start
from the top.

23:36.162 --> 23:37.529
Baby fried mozzarella balls
with marinara sauce.

23:37.529 --> 23:39.129
Parmesan breaded
pork chop.

23:39.129 --> 23:41.195
Baked clams. They're
not frozen, they're baked.

23:41.195 --> 23:42.195
It's so beautiful.

23:42.195 --> 23:43.529
Wow!

23:45.195 --> 23:46.662
Relaunch night.

23:46.662 --> 23:48.562
I was hoping Cece
would keep her standards high

23:48.562 --> 23:50.862
and her temper low.

23:50.862 --> 23:52.129
If something's ready,
don't wait.

23:52.129 --> 23:53.529
Just send it out.

23:53.529 --> 23:54.529
Does that look
good to you?

23:54.529 --> 23:55.471
It doesn't matter.

23:55.471 --> 23:55.962
It doesn't matter.

23:55.962 --> 23:58.295
That pork chop
looks burned from here.

23:58.295 --> 23:59.562
It's done like that.
Just send it out.

23:59.562 --> 24:00.862
Service!

24:02.129 --> 24:04.195
It's.

24:04.195 --> 24:05.495
I'm gonna
flip my lid,

24:05.495 --> 24:08.162
and none of you have seen me
go  crazy yet.

24:08.162 --> 24:10.195
You know, I don't
give a.

24:10.195 --> 24:12.995
If Cece had sent
that burnt pork chop out,

24:12.995 --> 24:15.395
as far as I was concerned,
she was history,

24:15.395 --> 24:17.362
and the restaurant
was gonna go under.

24:17.362 --> 24:19.462
I was really hoping she
was gonna do the right thing.

24:19.462 --> 24:20.462
I know it's hard.

24:20.462 --> 24:24.195
You do not
have to send it out.

24:24.195 --> 24:25.229
Make another one now.

24:25.229 --> 24:25.471
Thank you.

24:25.471 --> 24:26.129
Thank you.

24:26.129 --> 24:27.229
And just like that,

24:27.229 --> 24:29.062
Cece was on her way,

24:29.062 --> 24:32.329
taking control
and turning relaunch night

24:32.329 --> 24:33.395
into a huge, huge success.

24:33.395 --> 24:36.129
Okay, pork chops.
Start this table.

24:36.129 --> 24:37.229
Eggplant Parmesan,

24:37.229 --> 24:38.895
veal Marsala,
spaghetti bolognese.

24:38.895 --> 24:40.329
No more.
We don't have time.

24:40.329 --> 24:41.862
Thank you.
That's what I need to hear.

24:41.862 --> 24:42.862
We're gonna handle it.

24:44.229 --> 24:46.995
That's establishing
a standard, Cece.

24:46.995 --> 24:48.895
Not there,
but there, yes?

24:48.895 --> 24:50.062
Yes, Chef.

24:52.229 --> 24:54.195
You've got everything
you need, Cece,

24:54.195 --> 24:55.471
to make this place work.

24:55.471 --> 24:55.662
to make this place work.

24:55.662 --> 24:58.062
Go for it, yeah?

24:58.062 --> 24:59.695
Stay with it.
Can I hug you?

24:59.695 --> 25:01.695
Of course you can.
Come here, you. Well done.

25:01.695 --> 25:04.562
Well done.

25:04.562 --> 25:06.229
I'm back
in Boca Raton, Florida,

25:06.229 --> 25:08.729
to visit Anna Vincenzo's.

25:08.729 --> 25:10.829
When you think
Anna Vincenzo's,

25:10.829 --> 25:12.129
you think Cece.

25:12.129 --> 25:13.795
My goodness me.

25:13.795 --> 25:15.629
What a girl,
full of tantrums and tears.

25:15.629 --> 25:17.029
We made a lot of changes.

25:17.029 --> 25:19.295
I can't wait
to see how they're doing.

25:19.295 --> 25:23.295
More importantly,
what kind of mood is Cece in?

25:24.862 --> 25:25.471
Next, you won't
believe what Cece's done

25:25.471 --> 25:27.662
Next, you won't
believe what Cece's done

25:27.662 --> 25:29.062
since Chef Ramsay left.

25:29.062 --> 25:30.062
What happened?

25:30.062 --> 25:31.329
Don't miss

25:31.329 --> 25:32.729
one of the most shocking
revisits ever.

25:32.729 --> 25:34.229
I'm sorry to hear that.

25:34.229 --> 25:35.962
Then we're going
back to Le Bistro,

25:35.962 --> 25:38.729
where an angry owner
cared little for his customers.

25:38.729 --> 25:40.295
He wants
it medium rare.

25:40.295 --> 25:41.995
Tell him to go
himself.

25:41.995 --> 25:44.395
And was in a constant battle
with Chef Ramsay.

25:44.395 --> 25:46.229
You don't like it,
we're  no good,

25:46.229 --> 25:47.862
I'm lousy, whatever.

25:47.862 --> 25:50.195
Now, a year later,
we'll find out if Le Bistro

25:50.195 --> 25:53.329
is a big hit
or a big mess

25:53.329 --> 25:55.795
when Kitchen Nightmares
Revisited returns.

26:00.262 --> 26:02.062
Anna Vincenzo's,
an Italian restaurant

26:02.062 --> 26:03.729
in Boca Raton, Florida,

26:03.729 --> 26:05.495
was run by one of
the most volatile chefs

26:05.495 --> 26:06.829
Gordon has ever met.

26:08.295 --> 26:10.795
Can I get some
service back here?

26:10.795 --> 26:12.662
Cece was either
losing her temper...

26:12.662 --> 26:14.829
Well, you can't just act
like a precious princess.

26:14.829 --> 26:17.229
Yeah, I look like
a  princess, right?

26:17.229 --> 26:18.695
Or her composure.

26:21.795 --> 26:23.129
It took a lot of tears,

26:23.129 --> 26:26.029
But Chef Ramsay gave Cece
the tools to succeed.

26:26.029 --> 26:27.456
But now,
one year later...

26:27.456 --> 26:27.662
But now,
one year later...

26:27.662 --> 26:30.329
Anna Vincenzo's, gone.

26:30.329 --> 26:31.862
Chef Ramsay returns
to find out

26:31.862 --> 26:34.062
that Anna Vincenzo's
has gone out of business.

26:34.062 --> 26:35.062
Damn.

26:35.062 --> 26:36.029
Looking for some answers,

26:36.029 --> 26:38.129
Chef Ramsay turns
to the one person

26:38.129 --> 26:40.295
who would give him
the honest truth--

26:40.295 --> 26:42.395
former server, Ashton.

26:42.395 --> 26:43.995
Good to see you.
Good to see you, too.

26:43.995 --> 26:45.062
Now, what happened
first off?

26:45.062 --> 26:46.895
Did she slip back
to her old ways?

26:46.895 --> 26:48.295
Yeah.
Oh, no.

26:48.295 --> 26:50.129
Like, right when you left...
No.

26:50.129 --> 26:52.662
She's like, "Well,
the prices are way too cheap,"

26:52.662 --> 26:54.495
so she made
the prices more.

26:54.495 --> 26:56.129
Ohh!

26:56.129 --> 26:57.456
But them she also
lowered the portion size.

26:57.456 --> 26:57.962
But them she also
lowered the portion size.

26:57.962 --> 26:58.962
Oh, my God.

26:58.962 --> 27:00.595
So it's like
she's doubling price

27:00.595 --> 27:03.129
and making everything
half the size what it was.

27:03.129 --> 27:04.995
Determined to get
Cece's side of the story,

27:04.995 --> 27:07.795
Chef Ramsay paid a visit
to her home.

27:12.195 --> 27:13.729
Beautiful place.

27:13.729 --> 27:15.062
Okay, coming.

27:15.062 --> 27:17.795
Oh, my goodness me,
look at you.

27:17.795 --> 27:18.862
Hello.

27:18.862 --> 27:20.895
Holy crap.
What happened?

27:20.895 --> 27:24.029
Uh, I lost a half.

27:24.029 --> 27:25.795
The secret to weight loss
is stress.

27:27.129 --> 27:27.456
I mean, that's like
the quickest--boop!

27:27.456 --> 27:29.629
I mean, that's like
the quickest--boop!

27:29.629 --> 27:30.629
The quickest remedy.

27:30.629 --> 27:31.829
I can't believe.

27:31.829 --> 27:33.229
Anna Vincenzo's...
Yeah.

27:33.229 --> 27:34.229
It's gone.

27:34.229 --> 27:36.029
Yeah,
we said good-bye.

27:36.029 --> 27:39.029
What happened?
I sold.

27:39.029 --> 27:42.995
I'm finding that
hard to understand why

27:42.995 --> 27:46.029
when it meant
so much to you at the time.

27:46.029 --> 27:48.562
It's just too much
of my personal things

27:48.562 --> 27:49.962
got in the way,

27:49.962 --> 27:51.162
and it was
just more important.

27:51.162 --> 27:53.062
My kids are
the most important thing.

27:53.062 --> 27:55.729
Once you have your children,

27:55.729 --> 27:57.095
your life
changes completely.

27:57.095 --> 27:57.456
Anna Vincenzo
was my first baby.

27:57.456 --> 27:58.895
Anna Vincenzo
was my first baby.

27:58.895 --> 28:00.962
I had to make a choice.
I couldn't do both.

28:00.962 --> 28:02.929
My family's
always come first.

28:02.929 --> 28:04.695
Was the restaurant busy?

28:04.695 --> 28:05.862
Yeah,
we were doing good,

28:05.862 --> 28:07.962
but, uh, the opportunity
came up,

28:07.962 --> 28:10.529
and I want to be
with my kids.

28:10.529 --> 28:11.795
And how's Angelo?
How's dad?

28:11.795 --> 28:12.829
He's good.

28:13.829 --> 28:16.029
him?

28:18.162 --> 28:19.695
And what about his feelings

28:19.695 --> 28:20.962
of saying good-bye
to the restaurant?

28:20.962 --> 28:22.462
He has
the same mixed feelings,

28:22.462 --> 28:25.295
like, "Oh, jeez, am I ever
gonna make a pizza again?"

28:25.295 --> 28:26.662
Or, you know.

28:26.662 --> 28:27.456
Did you pay
him the money back?

28:27.456 --> 28:27.995
Did you pay
him the money back?

28:27.995 --> 28:29.895
Whatever I'm getting
from the sale

28:29.895 --> 28:31.462
is going to him, yes.

28:31.462 --> 28:32.962
And, uh, Michael,
how is he?

28:32.962 --> 28:34.195
We've, uh, separated.

28:34.195 --> 28:37.029
Damn.
I'm sorry.

28:37.029 --> 28:38.029
And what happened?

28:38.029 --> 28:39.662
Because you two seemed
to be getting on just fine.

28:39.662 --> 28:42.195
I don't know, everyday life,
pressure of the business,

28:42.195 --> 28:44.129
and...
jeez.

28:44.129 --> 28:46.062
Two kids and...

28:46.062 --> 28:47.195
Just a lot.

28:47.195 --> 28:48.629
How do you feel now?

28:48.629 --> 28:50.129
I feel good.

28:50.129 --> 28:51.462
Mm-hmm?

28:51.462 --> 28:52.529
You feel good?

28:52.529 --> 28:53.562
I feel good.

28:53.562 --> 28:54.862
You look very calm.
I am.

28:54.862 --> 28:56.129
Relaxed.
I am.

28:56.129 --> 28:56.962
When's he
coming back?

28:56.962 --> 28:57.456
Why do I stand here
cooking for nothing?

28:57.456 --> 28:58.995
Why do I stand here
cooking for nothing?

28:58.995 --> 29:01.229
I was--I was
under a lot of stress.

29:01.229 --> 29:03.695
Okay, so you're at home with
the children on a daily basis.

29:03.695 --> 29:04.795
Do you have a job?

29:04.795 --> 29:06.162
You know, you could
give me a job.

29:06.162 --> 29:07.362
I can work
one of your kitchens.

29:07.362 --> 29:08.995
I could give you
a job?

29:08.995 --> 29:10.629
I'd be great
to work for you.

29:10.629 --> 29:12.829
Well, you can't just act
like a precious princess.

29:12.829 --> 29:15.195
Yeah, I look like
a  princess, right?

29:15.195 --> 29:17.895
Yeah, but I'm not
that crazy.

29:17.895 --> 29:19.829
I was like, "Oh, my God.

29:19.829 --> 29:22.495
"Okay, no wait,
I'm a different woman now.

29:22.495 --> 29:24.729
Stay calm."

29:24.729 --> 29:27.129
Go back 12 months,
the worst moments.

29:27.129 --> 29:27.456
I think the worst, worst

29:27.456 --> 29:28.062
I think the worst, worst

29:28.062 --> 29:29.629
was when you told me
that I didn't care.

29:29.629 --> 29:30.962
I care.

29:30.962 --> 29:32.395
If I didn't care,
I wouldn't  be here,

29:32.395 --> 29:35.462
So stop saying
I don't care!

29:35.462 --> 29:36.562
Just stop, please.

29:36.562 --> 29:38.195
I'm happy you've
made that decision

29:38.195 --> 29:39.295
to commit to the family,

29:39.295 --> 29:40.995
and, listen,
you know more than anyone

29:40.995 --> 29:43.129
what's right for you,
and you follow your instincts.

29:43.129 --> 29:44.962
I was just saddened
at the fact that I returned

29:44.962 --> 29:47.629
and Anna Vincenzo's
wasn't run by Cece.

29:47.629 --> 29:49.629
Though I'm happy to see
you're in a good state.

29:49.629 --> 29:50.629
Thank you.

29:50.629 --> 29:52.829
I think Gordon and I
are very similar

29:52.829 --> 29:55.162
in the sense that
on the outside,

29:55.162 --> 29:57.162
it's a tough shell,
and then on the inside,

29:57.162 --> 29:57.456
it's, you know, soft.

29:57.456 --> 29:58.329
it's, you know, soft.

29:58.329 --> 29:59.329
Take care of yourself.

29:59.329 --> 30:00.562
You do the same.

30:00.562 --> 30:02.029
He's not that bad
of a guy.

30:02.029 --> 30:03.995
He's not that bad.

30:06.062 --> 30:08.462
Look at that. Wow.

30:10.195 --> 30:13.062
Coming up, he was one
of the most defensive owners

30:13.062 --> 30:14.895
Chef Ramsay
has ever tried to help.

30:14.895 --> 30:16.862
I'm a loser, everybody.

30:16.862 --> 30:18.895
Oh, my God.
I'm the worst.

30:18.895 --> 30:20.162
Now a year later,

30:20.162 --> 30:21.695
Chef Ramsay
is in for a surprise.

30:21.695 --> 30:23.029
What's going on?

30:23.029 --> 30:24.462
See what it is

30:24.462 --> 30:26.029
when Kitchen Nightmares
Revisited continues.

30:34.039 --> 30:36.205
When you move
to Lighthouse Point, Florida,

30:36.205 --> 30:37.572
you know you've made it.

30:37.572 --> 30:39.105
Minutes from Boca Raton,

30:39.105 --> 30:41.039
this little town
is filled with mansions

30:41.039 --> 30:43.039
and millionaires.

30:43.039 --> 30:45.772
But the locals who dared
step into Le Bistro

30:45.772 --> 30:46.772
were treated like dirt.

30:46.772 --> 30:48.039
He wants medium rare.

30:48.039 --> 30:49.305
Tell him
to go  himself.

30:49.305 --> 30:50.672
Yeah?

30:50.672 --> 30:53.172
Andy, the owner,
was so bloody arrogant.

30:53.172 --> 30:56.772
His motto was
"The customer's always wrong."

30:56.772 --> 30:58.005
Steak is gristly!

30:58.005 --> 30:58.460
Get the
out of here.

30:58.460 --> 31:00.105
Get the
out of here.

31:00.105 --> 31:01.439
That's beautiful
beef tenderloin.

31:01.439 --> 31:03.272
They're
a local customer.

31:03.272 --> 31:04.305
I don't
give a.

31:04.305 --> 31:05.772
Andy was an angry man,

31:05.772 --> 31:07.172
And no one knew it
better than his staff.

31:07.172 --> 31:08.605
Hey, what's that
over there?

31:08.605 --> 31:09.605
Get off the shelf.

31:09.605 --> 31:11.039
His poor wife, Elin,

31:11.039 --> 31:12.105
Ran the front of house.

31:12.105 --> 31:15.105
Be happy.
Don't be, "Uhh, uhh."

31:15.105 --> 31:17.072
It's a bistro.
It's fun, it's upbeat.

31:17.072 --> 31:18.205
It was bleeding money.

31:18.205 --> 31:20.439
I was determined
to find out why.

31:20.439 --> 31:22.739
As usual,
I started with the food.

31:22.739 --> 31:25.005
Okay, here's the rillette.

31:25.005 --> 31:26.205
Mmm.

31:26.205 --> 31:28.005
Bon appetit.
Thank you.

31:28.005 --> 31:28.460
One bite

31:28.460 --> 31:29.572
One bite

31:29.572 --> 31:33.172
nearly sent me straight
to the dentist's chair.

31:33.172 --> 31:34.372
One little bite.

31:34.372 --> 31:36.439
I think I just
chipped my tooth.

31:36.439 --> 31:38.105
You did?
Duck cartilage.

31:39.205 --> 31:41.205
Show him the bone
as well..

31:41.205 --> 31:42.572
I think I've just
busted my tooth.

31:42.572 --> 31:45.072
Hey, man, he found
the bones in the duck.

31:45.072 --> 31:47.105
Listen, go away.

31:47.105 --> 31:48.339
I gave Andy another shot

31:48.339 --> 31:50.939
With his famous
lamb curry roll.

31:50.939 --> 31:52.505
Sounds very French, right?

31:52.505 --> 31:54.139
It's just
very rubbery.

31:54.139 --> 31:56.005
Something was very wrong.

31:56.005 --> 31:57.039
He hate it.

31:57.039 --> 31:58.339
Andy had studied

31:58.339 --> 31:58.460
In top Michelin restaurants
just like me,

31:58.460 --> 32:00.339
In top Michelin restaurants
just like me,

32:00.339 --> 32:01.872
but, I promise you,

32:01.872 --> 32:04.105
I've never, ever
cooked crap like that.

32:04.105 --> 32:06.072
The rillette,

32:06.072 --> 32:07.839
I don't know if anyone
gave you feedback,

32:07.839 --> 32:09.105
but it was on the verge
of breaking my tooth.

32:09.105 --> 32:10.105
I'm the chef.

32:10.105 --> 32:11.705
You don't like it,
that's fine.

32:11.705 --> 32:12.939
It's your opinion.

32:12.939 --> 32:15.772
, we're no good,
I'm lousy, whatever.

32:15.772 --> 32:17.939
Me,
do you have issues.

32:17.939 --> 32:20.005
As if bad food
and a defensive owner

32:20.005 --> 32:21.372
Weren't bad enough,

32:21.372 --> 32:24.039
that night, I discovered
another problem.

32:24.039 --> 32:26.205
The service--slow.

32:27.505 --> 32:28.460
Is Alex the only one
that takes orders in there?

32:28.460 --> 32:29.739
Is Alex the only one
that takes orders in there?

32:29.739 --> 32:32.572
Yes, one person
takes the orders,

32:32.572 --> 32:35.172
and it slows down
things for Andy.

32:35.172 --> 32:36.672
Amazing. Andy wouldn't allow

32:36.672 --> 32:38.205
any other waiter
to take orders.

32:38.205 --> 32:39.072
Not only that...

32:39.072 --> 32:40.405
But you actually
cook as well, or not?

32:40.405 --> 32:41.572
I can,

32:41.572 --> 32:43.105
but Andy
does not let me cook.

32:43.105 --> 32:45.172
He wouldn't let
his sous chef do anything

32:45.172 --> 32:46.705
But stand around.

32:46.705 --> 32:48.939
This is definitely his little
kingdom here, isn't it?

32:48.939 --> 32:50.005
He's a one-man band.

32:50.005 --> 32:52.172
Hey, hey, hey, we don't
have time for talking.

32:52.172 --> 32:53.505
I don't care
if it's him or the queen.

32:54.605 --> 32:55.805
When food finally arrived...

32:55.805 --> 32:57.105
That's gross.

32:57.105 --> 32:58.439
It's inedible.

32:58.439 --> 32:58.460
It was quickly sent back
to the kitchen.

32:58.460 --> 33:00.472
It was quickly sent back
to the kitchen.

33:00.472 --> 33:01.839
Andy?

33:01.839 --> 33:04.039
She wants it well,
but not charred.

33:04.039 --> 33:05.839
They asked for medium well;
that's medium well.

33:05.839 --> 33:06.872
She wants it more.

33:06.872 --> 33:08.272
Whatever.

33:08.272 --> 33:10.705
I'd stop right there
if I were you and go away.

33:10.705 --> 33:12.439
You treat your wife
like a  dog.

33:12.439 --> 33:13.772
Don't bring my wife
into it.

33:13.772 --> 33:15.405
I'm gonna do it.

33:15.405 --> 33:16.439
Do you know why?

33:16.439 --> 33:18.005
Don't bring
my  wife into it!

33:18.005 --> 33:19.405
Don't you
go there!

33:19.405 --> 33:21.572
Don't point
that  thing at me.

33:21.572 --> 33:23.539
Well, just calm down.

33:23.539 --> 33:25.705
Amazing.

33:25.705 --> 33:27.672
Bye-bye.
Good night.

33:29.372 --> 33:31.739
You've never, ever, ever

33:31.739 --> 33:33.405
understood the value
of your customers,

33:33.405 --> 33:35.772
let alone your staff,

33:35.772 --> 33:38.905
because you don't
give a  about them.

33:38.905 --> 33:40.405
I'm a loser, everybody.

33:42.372 --> 33:44.505
Oh, my God.
I'm the worst.

33:44.505 --> 33:46.705
Obviously, Andy was
far too proud and stubborn

33:46.705 --> 33:48.672
to hear the truth from me,

33:48.672 --> 33:50.605
so I had a little trick
up my sleeve.

33:50.605 --> 33:52.872
The next morning,
I invited him and Elin

33:52.872 --> 33:54.505
out for a little boat ride.

33:54.505 --> 33:55.872
How cool is this?

33:55.872 --> 33:57.005
Terrific.

33:57.005 --> 33:58.139
Got a little surprise
for you.

33:58.139 --> 33:58.460
Sandwich would be nice.

33:58.460 --> 33:59.772
Sandwich would be nice.

33:59.772 --> 34:00.839
Sandwich,.

34:00.839 --> 34:02.872
Stop thinking
about your tummy.

34:02.872 --> 34:05.872
In this room
are your previous customers,

34:05.872 --> 34:08.872
and they've got
some very important information

34:08.872 --> 34:10.105
to tell you.

34:10.105 --> 34:11.239
It just in general

34:11.239 --> 34:13.272
did not live up
to our expectations.

34:13.272 --> 34:15.072
You walk through the door,
it's kind of dark, gloomy.

34:15.072 --> 34:16.105
There's no one
in there at all.

34:16.105 --> 34:17.439
It's just
very uncomfortable.

34:17.439 --> 34:18.872
Honestly, deep down,

34:18.872 --> 34:22.172
are you looking for naked women
dancing on the table?

34:22.172 --> 34:24.039
Hey, relax. Relax.

34:24.039 --> 34:25.439
What are you looking for?

34:25.439 --> 34:27.072
Relax, relax, relax.

34:27.072 --> 34:28.460
They don't want to see
naked dancers on the table.

34:28.460 --> 34:28.772
They don't want to see
naked dancers on the table.

34:28.772 --> 34:29.839
Come on, Andy.

34:29.839 --> 34:31.072
These are customers.

34:31.072 --> 34:32.605
At that night's
dinner service,

34:32.605 --> 34:34.339
Andy was
up to his old tricks.

34:34.339 --> 34:36.105
I need
all the entrees now.

34:36.105 --> 34:37.572
Elin,
don't make matters worse.

34:37.572 --> 34:39.005
It's bad enough
having him on my ass.

34:39.005 --> 34:40.005
I'm just saying.

34:40.005 --> 34:41.239
Six has been there forever.

34:41.239 --> 34:42.439
To prove a point,

34:42.439 --> 34:44.005
I went to the restaurant
next door

34:44.005 --> 34:46.105
and ordered dinner.

34:46.105 --> 34:47.239
Would you mind
if I order to go?

34:47.239 --> 34:48.372
No, sir, not at all.

34:48.372 --> 34:50.605
Seared tuna. How long?
About ten minutes.

34:50.605 --> 34:52.772
Sure enough,
ten minutes later,

34:52.772 --> 34:55.039
I was enjoying
a great meal.

34:55.039 --> 34:56.172
That is
absolutely delicious.

34:56.172 --> 34:57.872
While impatient customers
sat inside,

34:57.872 --> 34:58.460
I pulled Elin outside
for a wake-up call.

34:58.460 --> 35:01.339
I pulled Elin outside
for a wake-up call.

35:01.339 --> 35:03.139
They are full.

35:03.139 --> 35:05.005
I'm just trying
to show you

35:05.005 --> 35:06.739
what's happening
on your doorstep.

35:08.105 --> 35:10.105
We're going to have
to have a serious talk.

35:10.105 --> 35:12.405
After the last
angry customer left,

35:12.405 --> 35:14.839
The moment
I'd been waiting for.

35:14.839 --> 35:18.072
Andy finally
let his guard down.

35:18.072 --> 35:19.872
You're about to blow it

35:19.872 --> 35:21.672
completely.

35:21.672 --> 35:22.905
We're at that point.

35:22.905 --> 35:26.072
You've brought it
to light.

35:26.072 --> 35:27.439
You've came,
and you've told us,

35:27.439 --> 35:28.460
and you've showed us,

35:28.460 --> 35:28.539
and you've showed us,

35:28.539 --> 35:31.005
and you've
brought it to light.

35:31.005 --> 35:33.272
Encouraged, my team and I
spent the night

35:33.272 --> 35:35.205
Completely renovating
Le Bistro.

35:35.205 --> 35:36.672
Have a look
at your new sign.

35:36.672 --> 35:40.039
Oh, that's fabulous.

35:40.039 --> 35:41.005
Modern, legible.

35:41.005 --> 35:42.505
Isn't it nice?
I love it.

35:42.505 --> 35:43.505
Ready to go inside,
have a look?

35:43.505 --> 35:44.705
This is great.

35:44.705 --> 35:45.705
Gone are the booths.

35:45.705 --> 35:46.839
Oh, thank God.

35:46.839 --> 35:48.005
Take a seat.

35:48.005 --> 35:49.439
Ahh!

35:49.439 --> 35:51.005
I also reworked
Andy's menu.

35:51.005 --> 35:52.105
The gazpacho,

35:52.105 --> 35:53.372
perfect for a hot
summer's evening.

35:53.372 --> 35:54.772
Oysters--
local oysters.

35:54.772 --> 35:56.439
Extraordinary.
Steamed mussels.

35:56.439 --> 35:58.139
I would order that.
Perfect.

35:58.139 --> 35:58.460
For relaunch night,

35:58.460 --> 35:59.705
For relaunch night,

35:59.705 --> 36:01.205
I invited
a bunch of local V.I.P.s

36:01.205 --> 36:02.705
we're anxious
to try your food.

36:02.705 --> 36:04.939
Oh, I'm so anxious.
I'm glad you're here.

36:04.939 --> 36:06.172
Here you are.
Thank you.

36:06.172 --> 36:07.339
And the night got off
to a great start.

36:07.339 --> 36:08.705
Wow, that's really good.

36:08.705 --> 36:12.039
But soon enough, Andy reverted
to his bad old ways.

36:12.039 --> 36:13.205
Come here
two seconds, please.

36:13.205 --> 36:14.739
Chef.

36:14.739 --> 36:16.605
What the
is going on there?

36:16.605 --> 36:18.272
This one's more cooked
than that one, Chef.

36:18.272 --> 36:19.939
I couldn't believe it.

36:19.939 --> 36:21.939
Andy was about to send out
undercooked food

36:21.939 --> 36:24.172
and completely ruin
his relaunch night.

36:24.172 --> 36:27.405
I quickly called him outside
and gave him a big gut check.

36:27.405 --> 36:28.460
Where's the standards?

36:28.460 --> 36:30.339
Where's the standards?

36:30.339 --> 36:32.205
You're right.

36:32.205 --> 36:33.072
I admit that.

36:33.072 --> 36:36.739
You coming here,
big eye-opener.

36:36.739 --> 36:38.072
I was so pleased.

36:38.072 --> 36:40.839
The arrogance and
the defensiveness were gone.

36:40.839 --> 36:42.405
Andy marched
back into the kitchen

36:42.405 --> 36:45.872
and saved the biggest night
of his career.

36:45.872 --> 36:47.572
You know what you could do,
would be nice?

36:47.572 --> 36:49.172
If you put the spinach
on for me.

36:49.172 --> 36:50.139
The snapper's delicious.

36:50.139 --> 36:51.772
They did
a really good job.

36:51.772 --> 36:54.505
Thank you very much.
Okay.

36:54.505 --> 36:58.305
I finally saw the man
I've been dying to see.

36:58.305 --> 36:58.460
You cooked
brilliantly well.

36:58.460 --> 37:00.139
You cooked
brilliantly well.

37:00.139 --> 37:01.272
You're a different man.

37:01.272 --> 37:02.805
Without you,
it wasn't possible.

37:02.805 --> 37:04.872
We appreciate it.

37:04.872 --> 37:07.105
Take care
of that stubborn mule.

37:07.105 --> 37:08.772
Yes?

37:08.772 --> 37:10.905
Thank you.

37:10.905 --> 37:12.005
Well done.
Good job.

37:16.872 --> 37:18.772
I'm back
in Lighthouse Point, Florida,

37:18.772 --> 37:20.039
to visit Le Bistro.

37:20.039 --> 37:21.205
If you came here last year,

37:21.205 --> 37:22.872
you would have been
treated to slow service,

37:22.872 --> 37:25.439
mediocre food,
and a very arrogant owner.

37:25.439 --> 37:27.505
We got to it,
made a lot of changes.

37:27.505 --> 37:28.460
I'm back to find out
if all that work has paid off.

37:28.460 --> 37:31.005
I'm back to find out
if all that work has paid off.

37:31.005 --> 37:33.439
Coming up, Chef Ramsay returns

37:33.439 --> 37:35.072
and is holding nothing back.

37:35.072 --> 37:37.005
The big question,
is he still stubborn?

37:37.005 --> 37:38.905
Has Andy stayed the course

37:38.905 --> 37:40.272
and turned around Le Bistro?

37:40.272 --> 37:41.539
I'm not gonna
lie to you.

37:41.539 --> 37:43.205
Or is it a flop in Florida?

37:43.205 --> 37:46.339
Find out when Kitchen Nightmares
Revisited continues.

37:51.982 --> 37:55.148
Chef Ramsay has dealt
with a lot of stubborn owners,

37:55.148 --> 37:57.848
but Andy at Le Bistro
was in a league of his own.

37:57.848 --> 37:59.348
Don't you
go there!

37:59.348 --> 38:00.815
It wasn't easy,

38:00.815 --> 38:01.981
But Chef Ramsay
got through to Andy

38:01.981 --> 38:04.015
and helped turn
the business around.

38:04.015 --> 38:07.748
Now, one year later,
is Le Bistro still thriving,

38:07.748 --> 38:11.415
or has Andy gone back
to his old ways?

38:11.415 --> 38:13.115
Last time
I was at Le Bistro,

38:13.115 --> 38:15.148
the food was awful,
the service was slow,

38:15.148 --> 38:17.081
and the business
was falling apart.

38:17.081 --> 38:18.466
Worse than that,
Andy wouldn't change a thing.

38:18.466 --> 38:19.915
Worse than that,
Andy wouldn't change a thing.

38:19.915 --> 38:22.148
More importantly, he just
wanted to fight with me.

38:22.148 --> 38:24.415
We managed to turn him
and the business around.

38:24.415 --> 38:27.148
I'm just hoping
he stayed on that right path.

38:27.148 --> 38:29.115
Please.

38:31.248 --> 38:32.715
Look at this place.
How are you?

38:32.715 --> 38:34.081
Welcome back.
Good to see you.

38:34.081 --> 38:35.715
Great to see you.
You look great.

38:35.715 --> 38:37.448
You look fantastic.
Thank you.

38:37.448 --> 38:38.448
We're great,
we're great.

38:38.448 --> 38:39.715
Everything is great.

38:39.715 --> 38:41.115
In general, business...

38:41.115 --> 38:42.048
Business has been great.

38:42.048 --> 38:43.848
10% up? 5% up?

38:43.848 --> 38:45.315
Uh, maybe 20.

38:45.315 --> 38:47.015
20% up?
Mm-hmm.

38:47.015 --> 38:48.015
That's great news.
Absolutely.

38:48.015 --> 38:48.466
The big question
I've been dying to ask--

38:48.466 --> 38:49.815
The big question
I've been dying to ask--

38:49.815 --> 38:51.815
is he still stubborn?

38:51.815 --> 38:53.148
He wants medium rare.

38:53.148 --> 38:55.015
Tell him
to go  himself.

38:55.015 --> 38:57.181
Well, certain things
won't change,

38:57.181 --> 38:59.981
but he's actually become
a lot more lighthearted.

38:59.981 --> 39:01.915
He was a tough nut
to crack.

39:01.915 --> 39:03.148
I know that.

39:03.148 --> 39:04.015
Where is he?

39:04.015 --> 39:05.448
He is back there
in the kitchen.

39:05.448 --> 39:06.648
Is he?
Yes.

39:06.648 --> 39:07.748
Dare I?
Oh, please.

39:07.748 --> 39:09.148
Jeez, here we go.

39:09.148 --> 39:10.615
Good luck.
Thank you.

39:11.948 --> 39:13.781
Hey.
Hey, how you doin'?

39:13.781 --> 39:15.648
Fine. How are you?
Nice to see you.

39:15.648 --> 39:18.466
I can see how clear
this place is now.

39:18.466 --> 39:18.481
I can see how clear
this place is now.

39:18.481 --> 39:19.781
The big fridge gone.

39:19.781 --> 39:21.781
Can you communicate a lot
easier now with the waiters?

39:21.781 --> 39:23.481
Well, you can see now.

39:23.481 --> 39:24.615
The big question for me,

39:24.615 --> 39:26.281
have you started
to delegate?

39:26.281 --> 39:27.615
Yes, definitely.

39:27.615 --> 39:29.148
You're changing.

39:29.148 --> 39:31.281
You didn't like the customers
last time round.

39:31.281 --> 39:32.881
The steak is gristly.

39:32.881 --> 39:34.548
Get the
out of here.

39:34.548 --> 39:36.115
That's beautiful
beef tenderloin.

39:36.115 --> 39:37.481
They're
a local customer.

39:37.481 --> 39:39.215
I don't
give a.

39:39.215 --> 39:40.115
Well, you know,
I think you just get

39:40.115 --> 39:41.481
used to people,
I think, more.

39:41.481 --> 39:42.781
Yeah, of course.

39:42.781 --> 39:44.248
I think the biggest thing
that I got

39:44.248 --> 39:46.048
after Gordon Ramsay
being here

39:46.048 --> 39:47.815
was change is good.

39:47.815 --> 39:48.466
And we did
a lot of changes,

39:48.466 --> 39:49.948
And we did
a lot of changes,

39:49.948 --> 39:51.048
so we did a lot of good.

39:51.048 --> 39:53.248
Okay, I'm hungry.
What's on the menu?

39:53.248 --> 39:54.615
Um...

39:54.615 --> 39:55.648
Surprise me.

39:55.648 --> 39:56.915
Yeah?
Good, good, good.

40:02.748 --> 40:04.081
He looks relaxed
in there.

40:04.081 --> 40:05.148
Oh, yeah, he is.

40:05.148 --> 40:06.448
I'm almost, uh...

40:06.448 --> 40:07.448
He's like a changed man.

40:07.448 --> 40:08.481
He is different,

40:08.481 --> 40:10.115
he's different.

40:10.115 --> 40:12.315
He's more comfortable
with what he's doing,

40:12.315 --> 40:14.081
with being here
at Le Bistro.

40:14.081 --> 40:16.248
So has he become less of
a snob and more of a local?

40:16.248 --> 40:18.048
Yes, he has.

40:18.048 --> 40:18.466
Gordon helped Andy

40:18.466 --> 40:21.248
Gordon helped Andy

40:21.248 --> 40:22.715
out of the mindset

40:22.715 --> 40:26.048
that he's working in
a three-star Michelin restaurant

40:26.048 --> 40:29.248
in Paris or London.

40:29.248 --> 40:30.415
Thank you.
That looks amazing.

40:30.415 --> 40:32.081
Thank you, Andy.

40:32.081 --> 40:34.148
I've heard you've
turned into a bit of a, uh...

40:34.148 --> 40:36.615
A sort of lighthearted,
uh, talented,

40:36.615 --> 40:39.115
serious,
comedian-stroke-chef now.

40:39.115 --> 40:42.315
Please take a seat.

40:42.315 --> 40:45.148
Even though I felt confident

40:45.148 --> 40:46.848
That Gordon would
love the food,

40:46.848 --> 40:48.466
there must have been
a little tension for Andy,

40:48.466 --> 40:49.848
there must have been
a little tension for Andy,

40:49.848 --> 40:51.215
based upon what happened
the last time.

40:57.315 --> 40:58.981
Delicious.
Really good.

40:58.981 --> 41:00.581
It's so tender.

41:00.581 --> 41:02.048
It made me feel good to see
the reaction on his face

41:02.048 --> 41:04.148
'cause he genuinely
seemed to like the food.

41:04.148 --> 41:05.748
So a leopard
can change his spots.

41:07.781 --> 41:09.248
For you,
the worst moment.

41:09.248 --> 41:11.081
Probably the boat.
The boat.

41:11.081 --> 41:12.381
'Cause that hurt.

41:12.381 --> 41:13.881
You know, you walk
through the door,

41:13.881 --> 41:15.248
it's kind
of dark, gloomy,

41:15.248 --> 41:16.081
there's no one
in there at all.

41:16.081 --> 41:17.448
It's just
very uncomfortable.

41:17.448 --> 41:18.466
Honestly, deep down
are you looking

41:18.466 --> 41:18.915
Honestly, deep down
are you looking

41:18.915 --> 41:22.115
for naked women
dancing on the table?

41:22.115 --> 41:23.748
Whoa!
Hey, hey, relax.

41:23.748 --> 41:25.215
What are you looking for?

41:25.215 --> 41:26.415
Relax,
relax, relax.

41:26.415 --> 41:28.615
And I know you did that
to make a strong point.

41:28.615 --> 41:30.915
Very valid point.
Yeah.

41:30.915 --> 41:32.115
Good. On that note,

41:32.115 --> 41:33.448
I have a little surprise
for you both.

41:33.448 --> 41:35.381
Stay there.
Excuse me two seconds.

41:35.381 --> 41:37.248
Thank you.

41:37.248 --> 41:38.815
Oh, my gosh.

41:38.815 --> 41:39.815
That's really good.

41:42.715 --> 41:44.381
I'm so sorry
to interrupt you.

41:44.381 --> 41:47.048
Um, first of all,
really nice to see you.

41:47.048 --> 41:48.466
It means a lot for me
to be back here

41:48.466 --> 41:48.548
It means a lot for me
to be back here

41:48.548 --> 41:50.181
to see Elin and Andy
standing strong,

41:50.181 --> 41:52.815
and more importantly,
uh, this week

41:52.815 --> 41:58.348
marks their tenth year
in business at Le Bistro.

41:58.348 --> 41:59.981
Amazing.

42:01.381 --> 42:04.181
I'm sure you'll join me
in wishing them

42:04.181 --> 42:05.915
here's to another
very successful

42:05.915 --> 42:07.881
decade.

42:07.881 --> 42:08.915
It was more
than a toast.

42:08.915 --> 42:12.215
He spoke so highly of us

42:12.215 --> 42:13.748
and gave such
a phenomenal speech.

42:13.748 --> 42:15.215
Congratulations.
Well done.

42:15.215 --> 42:16.948
Congratulations.
Thank you very much.

42:16.948 --> 42:18.466
We would love Gordon Ramsay

42:18.466 --> 42:19.415
We would love Gordon Ramsay

42:19.415 --> 42:20.548
to be here
in the next ten years

42:20.548 --> 42:22.215
and see
this restaurant bustling.

42:22.215 --> 42:23.748
He'd have to make
a reservation, though,

42:23.748 --> 42:25.115
'cause he probably
wouldn't be able to get in.

42:25.115 --> 42:26.315
Lunch is
on the house today.

42:26.315 --> 42:29.048
Amazing!

42:29.048 --> 42:30.115
That was a joke.

42:31.148 --> 42:33.048
Thanks, Gordon.

42:33.048 --> 42:34.415
Thank you very much.

42:34.415 --> 42:36.248
Having Gordon Ramsay

42:36.248 --> 42:37.048
here at Le Bistro

42:37.048 --> 42:38.448
gave Andy and I
a lot of hope.

42:38.448 --> 42:40.048
So good to see you.
Likewise.

42:40.048 --> 42:42.681
I frankly don't know
what would have happened

42:42.681 --> 42:44.415
if he didn't come
last year.

42:44.415 --> 42:46.215
I don't know if we would have
still been opened.

42:46.215 --> 42:47.681
Good to see you both,
and good luck.

42:47.681 --> 42:48.466
Perhaps
the next decade.

42:48.466 --> 42:49.748
Perhaps
the next decade.

42:49.748 --> 42:51.048
Bye.
Take care.

42:51.048 --> 42:53.881
Unbelievable.
Andy's a completely changed man,

42:53.881 --> 42:55.281
and Elin looks so happy.

42:55.281 --> 42:57.481
But more importantly,
the food is stunning.

42:57.481 --> 42:59.415
Le Bistro
is finally on its way

42:59.415 --> 43:01.148
to becoming
a huge success.

43:01.148 --> 43:02.148
Who knows?

43:02.148 --> 43:05.555
One day, he may win
a Michelin star.
