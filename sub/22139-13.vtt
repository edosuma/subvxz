00:03.071 --> 00:04.272
**

00:04.305 --> 00:10.111
One and two and three and burn!

00:10.144 --> 00:12.280
What are you doing?

00:12.313 --> 00:13.547
Leg lifts.

00:13.581 --> 00:15.249
Keeps the man buns tight.

00:15.283 --> 00:17.518
Four and five.

00:17.551 --> 00:18.719
What are you up to?

00:18.752 --> 00:20.654
Nicole and I are gonna
go see "Spice World."

00:20.688 --> 00:22.356
I didn't know
you liked the Spice Girls.

00:22.390 --> 00:25.093
I don't, but Nicole
is obsessed with Scary.

00:25.126 --> 00:26.327
Guess she likes them crazy.

00:26.360 --> 00:30.431
Plus, one reviewer said it was
"4 stars shy of a 4-star movie."

00:30.464 --> 00:32.233
It's gonna be so bad
it's good.

00:32.266 --> 00:33.767
Like my British accent.

00:33.801 --> 00:36.070
I'll give you guys
a ride to the movie

00:36.104 --> 00:37.738
if you promise
to never do that again.

00:37.771 --> 00:39.473
Nicole's gonna drive.

00:39.507 --> 00:42.476
Besides,
your car is mad filthy.

00:42.510 --> 00:44.312
I can't be seen riding
that kind of dirty.

00:44.345 --> 00:46.780
What are you talking about?
My car isn't dirty.

00:46.814 --> 00:48.649
See?

00:48.682 --> 00:49.850
Clean.

00:49.883 --> 00:52.586
That's the side of the car
that gets hit by the sprinklers.

00:52.620 --> 00:55.656
**

00:55.689 --> 00:58.192
Oh.

00:58.226 --> 00:59.327
What happened?

00:59.360 --> 01:01.629
You and Mom used to wash
the car together every Sunday.

01:01.662 --> 01:04.298
Yeah, I guess
it's been a while.

01:06.667 --> 01:07.768
Huh.

01:07.801 --> 01:10.404
No wonder
the grass is dying.

01:12.573 --> 01:14.875

01:30.624 --> 01:33.261
Isn't this fun,
washing the car together?

01:33.294 --> 01:34.895
I can't believe
it's been so long.

01:35.796 --> 01:37.631
Where are all these flies
coming from?

01:37.665 --> 01:39.167
Is Marvin tanning a deer?

01:41.302 --> 01:43.371
Hey, Jessica.

01:43.404 --> 01:44.638
Oh!

01:44.672 --> 01:45.806
What are you doing?

01:45.839 --> 01:47.641
Oh, come on.
We love this.

01:47.675 --> 01:50.278
It's cheaper, faster, and better
than going to a car wash.

01:50.311 --> 01:52.913
And it's a free
upper-body workout. I know.

01:52.946 --> 01:55.816
Mommy, your book editor
is on the phone.

01:55.849 --> 01:57.451
Uch.

01:57.485 --> 01:59.153
Terry.

01:59.187 --> 02:01.389
He's in town and wants
to meet about the manuscript.

02:01.422 --> 02:04.458
I sent him a new draft,
and he still has notes.

02:04.492 --> 02:06.694
I also had some thoughts on your
last draft if you're open --

02:06.727 --> 02:08.596
I'm not.

02:09.497 --> 02:12.700
Sure, don't mind
what ol' Evan has to say.

02:12.733 --> 02:15.603
I'm only reading
at a 9th-grade level.

02:15.636 --> 02:19.240
Marvin: Hey, it's been a while
since you two washed the car.

02:19.273 --> 02:21.909
Hey. Marvin.

02:21.942 --> 02:23.311
How long
have you been sitting there?

02:23.344 --> 02:24.312
Three hours.

02:24.345 --> 02:25.513
Oh.

02:25.546 --> 02:27.648
Yeah, Jessica and I used to
wash the car every weekend,

02:27.681 --> 02:29.617
but she's been busy lately.

02:29.650 --> 02:31.319
I guess we'll get to it
when she has the time.

02:31.352 --> 02:33.187
Or maybe you'll never get
to it.

02:33.221 --> 02:34.388
What?

02:34.422 --> 02:36.890
I'm just sayin'. You gotta stay
on top of these things, Lou.

02:36.924 --> 02:38.959
You don't want to lose
that connection.

02:38.992 --> 02:40.394
You think
that's what's happening?

02:40.428 --> 02:41.562
Could be.
I mean, I don't know.

02:41.595 --> 02:45.399
I'm just one man,
reading Parade in the sun.

02:45.433 --> 02:47.301
I don't want
to lose our connection.

02:47.335 --> 02:50.271
Well, then remind her
how much she means to you.

02:50.304 --> 02:51.572
Get her a nice gift.

02:51.605 --> 02:52.673
That's what I always do.

02:54.308 --> 02:55.309
Aah!

02:55.343 --> 02:57.978
Marvin, call the store!
The diamonds got corroded!

02:58.011 --> 02:59.947
It's not corroded.

02:59.980 --> 03:01.282
It's chocolate.

03:03.517 --> 03:05.286
She never wore them.

03:05.319 --> 03:07.955
I asked her why once, and
she said, "Oh, I wear them!"

03:07.988 --> 03:09.490
But she doesn't.

03:09.523 --> 03:11.759
It's been a while
since I surprised Jessica

03:11.792 --> 03:12.926
with something nice.

03:12.960 --> 03:15.396
The last thing I got her was
a Taser when she complained

03:15.429 --> 03:17.498
about the crowd
outside Jack in the Box.

03:17.531 --> 03:19.900
Yeah, ever since they introduced
that Extreme Sausage Sandwich.

03:23.571 --> 03:26.940
When the boy visits
Santiago's shed each night,

03:26.974 --> 03:29.610
why does he reference
his favorite baseball player,

03:29.643 --> 03:30.811
Joe DiMaggio?

03:33.414 --> 03:34.982
Yes, Emery.

03:35.015 --> 03:38.386
DiMaggio's father was also
a poor fisherman, like Santiago.

03:38.419 --> 03:39.787
That's right.

03:39.820 --> 03:42.022
Santiago hoped the boy would
rise above his circumstance--

03:42.055 --> 03:44.258
I said that's right.

03:44.292 --> 03:48.629
Sorry to interrupt, Ms. Doris,
but I have some V.P.C. here.

03:49.397 --> 03:50.798
Very Precious Cargo.

03:50.831 --> 03:51.899
Oh.

03:51.932 --> 03:52.833
As you know,
Lincoln Middle School

03:52.866 --> 03:55.336
received its first grade-skipper
this year,

03:55.369 --> 03:58.772
and now he's skipping his way
into 7th-grade English.

03:58.806 --> 04:01.275
There are no seats
in the front row.

04:01.309 --> 04:03.844
Hey, Stripes.
To the back.

04:07.615 --> 04:09.717
This is so exciting.
We have a class together.

04:09.750 --> 04:11.885
We're discussing
"The Old Man and the Sea."

04:11.919 --> 04:13.921
Taking on classic literature,
family style.

04:13.954 --> 04:15.022
I like it.

04:15.055 --> 04:17.725
Okay, can anyone tell me
what the Old Man's struggle

04:17.758 --> 04:19.493
with the marlin represents?

04:19.527 --> 04:20.828
Ooh. Oh, oh!
I know, I know!

04:20.861 --> 04:25.433
**

04:25.466 --> 04:26.767
Where am I supposed
to sit?

04:26.800 --> 04:28.902
There's no empty desks
back here.

04:28.936 --> 04:31.472
Hell, knock off early.
You earned it.

04:32.840 --> 04:34.542
**

04:34.575 --> 04:35.776
Jessica,
I have a surprise for --

04:35.809 --> 04:38.612
Hi, Louis!
This is my editor, Terry.

04:38.646 --> 04:40.414
He arrived via Amtrak.

04:40.448 --> 04:42.850
Unfortunately,
I'm on a no-fly list.

04:42.883 --> 04:43.717
I don't want
to get into it.

04:43.751 --> 04:46.687
Tell Louis the story
about Tom Clancy.

04:46.720 --> 04:50.824
Rumor is,
Clancy's a vegetarian.

04:50.858 --> 04:52.593
Crazy.

04:52.626 --> 04:53.761
No meat.

04:53.794 --> 04:55.863
Uh, yeah, impressive.

04:55.896 --> 04:57.631
Uh, Jessica,
can I talk to you?

04:58.632 --> 05:01.435
**

05:01.469 --> 05:03.537
Okay, so here's the plan:
We go back out there,

05:03.571 --> 05:05.773
I'll say my kidney is hurting,
and I need a ride to dialysis.

05:05.806 --> 05:06.840
Louis, it's okay.

05:06.874 --> 05:08.409
I'm not looking
for an escape.

05:08.442 --> 05:10.578
Terry's
actually pretty interesting.

05:10.611 --> 05:12.446
But I thought
you said he was annoying,

05:12.480 --> 05:13.747
always giving you notes.

05:13.781 --> 05:16.049
Yeah, that is annoying,
but Terry was telling me

05:16.083 --> 05:18.619
he's edited
a lot of successful authors.

05:18.652 --> 05:21.522
You know who else hates
Terry's notes, but takes them?

05:22.456 --> 05:24.024
Koontz...

05:24.057 --> 05:27.361
I thought you were
gonna say more people.

05:27.395 --> 05:28.762
Well, who else
do I need to say?

05:28.796 --> 05:30.030
It's Koontz.

05:30.063 --> 05:32.866
Terry invited me to his client's
book reading later this week.

05:32.900 --> 05:35.436
He says if I really nail
these revisions,

05:35.469 --> 05:38.406
I could be traveling through
Florida on my own book tour.

05:38.439 --> 05:41.575
If all goes well, maybe
we even hit the Rust Belt.

05:41.609 --> 05:43.677
Uh, uh,
wait, wait, wait, wait.

05:43.711 --> 05:44.812
I got you something.

05:44.845 --> 05:47.981
Oh, what's this?

05:48.015 --> 05:50.150
**

05:50.183 --> 05:51.552
A fly swatter?

05:51.585 --> 05:52.820
Mm-hmm.
It's electric.

05:52.853 --> 05:54.455
Because earlier
they were bothering you.

05:54.488 --> 05:56.824
The Electro-Sizzle
has a 3,000-volt grid.

05:56.857 --> 05:58.659
It burns bugs' bodies
on contact...
Mm-hmm.

05:58.692 --> 06:00.694
...and makes a victory sound
every time you kill a queen.

06:00.728 --> 06:02.963
Great.
I'll play with it later.

06:02.996 --> 06:06.600
But -- But you got to properly
store it in its sheathe!

06:07.901 --> 06:12.840
**

06:12.873 --> 06:14.141
What are you doing?

06:14.174 --> 06:16.477
Making a diorama
of "The Old Man and the Sea."

06:16.510 --> 06:17.845
This is the scene
where Santiago

06:17.878 --> 06:19.580
uses a harpoon
to fend off sharks.

06:21.515 --> 06:24.885
Ms. Doris
didn't assign us a diorama.

06:24.918 --> 06:26.153
I know.

06:26.186 --> 06:28.722
Okay, Evan,
you're new to the class,

06:28.756 --> 06:30.558
so let me explain something
to you:

06:30.591 --> 06:32.893
I'm this close
to being Ms. Doris' favorite.

06:32.926 --> 06:34.027
Really?

06:34.061 --> 06:35.996
It doesn't seem like
she likes you.

06:36.029 --> 06:37.465
She told you
to put your head down

06:37.498 --> 06:39.066
for the last ten minutes
of class.

06:39.099 --> 06:40.834
She knows I get overexcited.

06:40.868 --> 06:43.437
I'll admit, she's been
a tough nut to crack.

06:43.471 --> 06:45.539
But I've almost got
that walnut shelled.

06:47.508 --> 06:49.710
Let me explain something
to you.

06:49.743 --> 06:52.480
I've been the favorite
of every teacher I've ever had.

06:52.513 --> 06:56.149
Much like Old Man Santiago,
I refuse to be defeated.

06:56.183 --> 06:57.485
You're out of your league,
little man!

06:57.518 --> 06:58.486
Turn around
and get outta here!

06:58.519 --> 06:59.820
Whoa, I hear conflict.

06:59.853 --> 07:01.021
Are you guys
fighting over a girl?

07:01.054 --> 07:02.122
No, a woman.

07:02.155 --> 07:03.056
Oh!

07:03.090 --> 07:04.124
It's our teacher.

07:04.157 --> 07:05.759
Oh.

07:05.793 --> 07:08.729
I don't care enough about this
to watch it conclude.

07:08.762 --> 07:10.063
I'm gonna go see
"Spice World" again.

07:10.097 --> 07:11.832
Turns out
it was really good.

07:11.865 --> 07:13.834
I'm gonna stay for the end
credits and everything.

07:13.867 --> 07:16.704
Everybody who worked on
that movie deserves my respect.

07:16.737 --> 07:20.741
**

07:25.078 --> 07:26.847
All right.

07:26.880 --> 07:29.249
Hey, Marvin.
Sorry to bother you at work.

07:29.282 --> 07:31.018
No, no.
It's totally fine.

07:31.051 --> 07:32.586
You got me between patients.

07:32.620 --> 07:34.187
Bye-bye, Mr. Jensen.

07:35.689 --> 07:37.691
Man.

07:37.725 --> 07:40.728
He always comes in
just after he's eaten salami.
Oh.

07:40.761 --> 07:42.229
I took your advice,
and it didn't work.

07:42.262 --> 07:45.165
I bought Jessica a fly swatter,
and she totally didn't care.

07:45.198 --> 07:47.034
The Electro-Sizzle.
It's awesome.

07:47.067 --> 07:48.669
You don't have to tell me.
I love mine.

07:48.702 --> 07:50.237
I took down a whole family
of moths with it

07:50.270 --> 07:52.139
after they destroyed
my peacoat.

07:52.172 --> 07:54.642
I left one alive
to deliver the message.

07:54.675 --> 07:56.610
Jessica normally loves
practical gifts,

07:56.644 --> 07:58.278
but I think
she was distracted by Terry.

07:58.311 --> 08:00.280
Who's Terry?
Her book editor.

08:00.313 --> 08:03.116
Wait, is this a male Terry
or a female Terry?

08:03.150 --> 08:04.251
Male Terry.

08:04.284 --> 08:06.687
Those are
the worst kind of Terrys.

08:07.621 --> 08:09.056
So, she's too busy
to wash the car,

08:09.089 --> 08:11.959
she's not interested
in bug-zapping technology,

08:11.992 --> 08:14.628
and now this male Terry comes
rolling in on the D train?

08:14.662 --> 08:17.264
Oh, this is more serious
than just loss of connection.

08:17.297 --> 08:19.266
This is
a classic 7-Year Itch.

08:19.299 --> 08:20.267
No, it's not.

08:20.300 --> 08:22.102
Jessica and I
have been married for 15 years.

08:22.135 --> 08:24.872
Oh, then it's gonna hit you
slightly harder than double.

08:24.905 --> 08:27.074
Every marriage
goes through this slump.

08:27.107 --> 08:28.576
Mine certainly did.

08:28.609 --> 08:29.610
How did you get through it?

08:29.643 --> 08:31.078
I got Honey!

08:36.083 --> 08:38.586
No way. My marriage
is not going to fall apart.

08:38.619 --> 08:40.120
Yeah, that's
what everybody thinks.

08:40.153 --> 08:43.591
Then time marches on, and
you drift a little bit apart.

08:43.624 --> 08:45.993
Before you know it, you end up
like Chrissie Shrimpton.

08:46.026 --> 08:47.060
Who's that?

08:47.094 --> 08:48.228
Mick Jagger's
first girlfriend.

08:48.261 --> 08:50.230
She supported Mick
in the early days.

08:50.263 --> 08:53.734
Once The Stones got rolling,
he rolled away from her

08:53.767 --> 08:55.669
and into the arms of Bianca.

08:55.703 --> 08:58.105
I don't want to be
Chrissie Shrimpton.

08:58.138 --> 08:59.106
Nobody does.

08:59.139 --> 09:00.741
Not even Chrissie Shrimpton.

09:00.774 --> 09:02.275
Well, what do I need to do?

09:02.309 --> 09:03.476
Up your game.

09:03.510 --> 09:06.680
You remind Jessica of the Louis
that she fell in love with.

09:06.714 --> 09:10.618
**

09:13.386 --> 09:15.889
Bye, Ms. Doris.
Hope you have a good night.

09:15.923 --> 09:18.225
And I hope
you have a wonderful night.

09:18.258 --> 09:20.160
Come on.

09:20.193 --> 09:21.929
What are you doing?

09:21.962 --> 09:23.664
What are you doing?

09:23.697 --> 09:25.866
I'm gonna clean
Ms. Doris' whiteboards.

09:25.899 --> 09:28.068
I was gonna rake
her desktop Zen garden.

09:28.101 --> 09:33.841
**

09:33.874 --> 09:34.875
Uhh!

09:34.908 --> 09:37.678
Must...erase...board.

09:37.711 --> 09:38.912
Get back here!

09:39.947 --> 09:41.882
Let...go!

09:44.217 --> 09:46.019
Must...rake...sand.

09:46.053 --> 09:47.020
Aah!

09:48.255 --> 09:50.357
-Stop.
-You stop!

09:52.325 --> 09:53.894
Hey.
Wait a minute.

09:53.927 --> 09:55.796
What's this?

09:58.031 --> 10:00.634
It's a photo
of Eddie and Ms. Doris?

10:00.668 --> 10:02.369
How come
you can see her teeth?

10:02.402 --> 10:05.138
I think she's...smiling.

10:05.172 --> 10:11.211

10:13.246 --> 10:15.983
[ Chris de Burgh's "Lady in Red"
plays ]

10:16.016 --> 10:19.019
* Ooh, ooh

10:19.052 --> 10:22.022
* Ooh, ooh-ooh

10:22.055 --> 10:25.292
* I've never seen you looking
so lovely as you did tonight *

10:25.325 --> 10:26.994
What are you doing?

10:27.027 --> 10:29.797
* I've never seen you shine
so bright *

10:29.830 --> 10:31.965
You got flowers
on my keyboard.

10:31.999 --> 10:34.301
You won't need your keyboard
in the bedroom.

10:34.334 --> 10:36.303
I've been doing leg lifts.

10:36.336 --> 10:37.738
Now is not a good time.

10:37.771 --> 10:39.072
I'm in the middle
of something.

10:39.106 --> 10:40.908
Oh, come on.
The boys are all out,

10:40.941 --> 10:44.211
and Mom's got her headphones on,
watching "NYPD Blue."

10:44.244 --> 10:48.015
The whole house is ours!

10:48.048 --> 10:50.283
I'm working
on my book revisions.

10:50.317 --> 10:52.953
* Or the highlights in your hair
that catch your eyes *

10:52.986 --> 10:54.755
Want me to tickle your head?

10:54.788 --> 10:55.723
What?

10:55.756 --> 10:57.657
Oh, what's another word
for "hemorrhage"?

10:58.726 --> 11:04.097
Bleed out.
* The lady in red

11:04.131 --> 11:07.000
* Is dancing with me

11:08.869 --> 11:10.437
I even offered
to tickle her head.

11:10.470 --> 11:12.105
Who offers to tickle
someone's head?

11:12.139 --> 11:14.107
I meant "neck," but in
the moment, I said "head."

11:14.141 --> 11:15.809
Oh, this is worse
than I thought.

11:15.843 --> 11:18.178
She's so focused on her book
she doesn't even see me.

11:18.211 --> 11:19.780
Well, then you got to get her
away from that.

11:19.813 --> 11:21.882
Get her out of the house.
Take her somewhere special.

11:21.915 --> 11:24.885
Like a romantic picnic
by the water.

11:24.918 --> 11:27.354
Ho-ho!
A checkered blanket for two.

11:27.387 --> 11:30.357
Oh, but Terry's in town,
she's on a deadline...

11:30.390 --> 11:31.491
It's not a good time.

11:31.524 --> 11:33.426
It's never gonna be
a good time.

11:33.460 --> 11:35.395
Forget all the reasons
for not doing it

11:35.428 --> 11:37.765
and just sweep her
off her feet.

11:38.899 --> 11:40.433
Oh, a little tip:

11:40.467 --> 11:43.036
No matter how well
you think things are going,

11:43.070 --> 11:44.972
do not attempt
to fly a kite.

11:45.005 --> 11:47.074
**

11:47.908 --> 11:50.343
No, I'm pretty sure
it's Porsche Spice.

11:50.377 --> 11:52.212
Like, what is Posh?

11:52.245 --> 11:55.215
All right, Nicole,
agree to disagree.

11:55.248 --> 11:58.018
Who were you talking to?
Your best friend Ms. Doris?

11:58.051 --> 12:01.454
Or should we say,
"Best Friends 4 Eva"?

12:01.488 --> 12:05.058
Oh, my God.
Where'd you guys find this?

12:05.092 --> 12:07.127
On her desk,
in a folder marked "memories."

12:07.160 --> 12:09.262
Aww.
Ms. Doris is the best.

12:09.296 --> 12:12.032
No, she's not. She's a cold
walnut we can't crack.

12:12.065 --> 12:13.166
How are you a teacher's pet?

12:13.200 --> 12:14.935
And that teacher
of all teachers?

12:14.968 --> 12:16.103
I'm not a teacher's pet.

12:16.136 --> 12:17.270
We just got along.

12:17.304 --> 12:18.538
What's your secret?

12:18.571 --> 12:20.273
There's no secret.

12:20.307 --> 12:22.075
I was just being myself.

12:24.177 --> 12:25.545
Shaaaq!

12:25.578 --> 12:27.915
Ms. Doris:
Dennis Scooott!

12:29.049 --> 12:32.485
Ms. D? You're into
the Orlando Magic?

12:32.519 --> 12:35.055
Season ticket holder.
Going tonight.

12:35.088 --> 12:38.558
Penny Hardaway is gonna
dominate that nerd Grant Hill.

12:38.591 --> 12:40.227
We need to hang out more.

12:40.260 --> 12:41.294
So we did.

12:41.328 --> 12:42.395
And then it was picture day,

12:42.429 --> 12:44.531
and we thought it would be
funny to take one together.

12:44.564 --> 12:46.066
And it was.

12:46.099 --> 12:47.567
That's how you got her
to like you?

12:47.600 --> 12:49.302
By playing trash basketball?

12:49.336 --> 12:51.138
You didn't make
an extra-credit diorama

12:51.171 --> 12:52.139
or come to class early

12:52.172 --> 12:54.307
to make sure her chair
was ergonomically set?

12:54.341 --> 12:56.877
When?
When did you do that?!

12:56.910 --> 12:58.946
Dude, stop trying
to kiss up to Ms. Doris.

12:58.979 --> 13:00.047
That's not gonna work
on her.

13:00.080 --> 13:02.549
If you had seen "Spice World,"
you'd realize that life

13:02.582 --> 13:03.416
is about trying
to find a way

13:03.450 --> 13:05.285
to make genuine connections
with people.

13:05.318 --> 13:07.120
Hang on.
Let me write this down.

13:07.154 --> 13:08.121
Aah!

13:08.155 --> 13:09.556
My Keroppi!

13:09.589 --> 13:11.224
This is
what I'm talking about.

13:11.258 --> 13:13.193
Don't write anything down.

13:13.226 --> 13:15.395
Just be regular.

13:17.197 --> 13:18.131
Do you think he --
Shh!

13:18.165 --> 13:20.934
I'm committing
his instructions to memory.

13:20.968 --> 13:23.470
Spice Girls,
genuine connection, be regular.

13:23.503 --> 13:25.105

13:25.138 --> 13:26.173
Got it.

Richard Ramirez,
Night Stalker!

13:52.432 --> 13:55.035
You tried to kidnap me?

13:55.068 --> 13:57.604
I was going to take you
on a romantic picnic.

13:57.637 --> 14:00.507
Until you shocked me
with the stun gun I bought you.

14:00.540 --> 14:02.442
That's how you wanted
to take me on a picnic?

14:02.475 --> 14:04.544
By sneaking up behind me
in a parking lot?

14:04.577 --> 14:06.479
You're lucky
I didn't have my gun gun.

14:06.513 --> 14:08.048
You own a real gun?

14:08.081 --> 14:09.950
Ach, quit trying
to turn this on me.

14:09.983 --> 14:11.518
What is going on with you,
Louis?

14:11.551 --> 14:14.421
I'm trying to get us
through our 15-Year Itch!

14:14.454 --> 14:15.588
15

14:15.622 --> 14:17.124
What is
this made

14:17.157 --> 14:19.026
What white friend
told you this?

14:19.059 --> 14:20.593
Marvin.
And he's right.

14:20.627 --> 14:22.162
We're drifting apart.

14:22.195 --> 14:24.164
Drifting apart?
I've just been busy.

14:24.197 --> 14:26.333
Too busy for your husband,
you mean.

14:26.366 --> 14:30.003
Not too busy to take notes
from Terry and work on your book

14:30.037 --> 14:32.572
and not properly store
your new fly swatter.

14:32.605 --> 14:34.307
Don't you care
about our marriage?

14:34.341 --> 14:35.542
Of course I do.

14:35.575 --> 14:38.045
Well, then why am I
the only one who's trying?

14:38.078 --> 14:39.512
You know what your problem is,
Louis?

14:39.546 --> 14:41.181
You think you're easy-going.

14:41.214 --> 14:42.349
And you are.

14:42.382 --> 14:44.284
Until you decide you aren't.

14:44.317 --> 14:45.953
And when that happens,
you expect me

14:45.986 --> 14:49.222
to drop what I'm doing
and be there for you.

14:49.256 --> 14:53.060
But this one time, I have
something that is just mine,

14:53.093 --> 14:54.928
something that's really
important to me

14:54.962 --> 14:56.463
outside of you
and the kids,

14:56.496 --> 14:58.431
suddenly
we're "drifting apart"?

14:58.465 --> 15:03.470
**

15:03.503 --> 15:07.040
All right, I got her on
"assault with a deadly weapon"

15:07.074 --> 15:08.475
and you
on "false imprisonment."

15:08.508 --> 15:10.110
Those charges offset.

15:10.143 --> 15:13.280
So how about we say
"marital misunderstanding"

15:13.313 --> 15:15.615
and "attempted picnic"
and call it a day?

15:15.648 --> 15:20.687
**

15:25.092 --> 15:26.626
**

15:26.659 --> 15:28.228
Thanks for the ride home.

15:28.261 --> 15:30.430
I'll bet this is the first time
you've ever seen a husband

15:30.463 --> 15:32.332
get tased by his wife.

15:34.234 --> 15:35.468
Oh, that's funny.

15:35.502 --> 15:37.370
That's a good one.

15:37.404 --> 15:39.072
Did you hear
what Jessica said back there?

15:39.106 --> 15:41.141
We all heard
what Jessica said.

15:41.174 --> 15:42.475
Her voice carries.

15:42.509 --> 15:45.012
I don't expect her to drop
what she's doing.

15:45.045 --> 15:47.014
And I am easy-going.
I don't ask for much.

15:47.047 --> 15:48.615
That's what
most husbands think.

15:48.648 --> 15:50.617
'Cause they're used to
being the focal point.

15:50.650 --> 15:52.552
Whose side are you on?

15:52.585 --> 15:55.088
You know what?
Just let me out.

15:55.122 --> 15:58.091
I think you'll find
you can't open the doors.

15:58.125 --> 15:59.359
I'm just saying.

15:59.392 --> 16:02.062
Sometimes we expect things
to be a certain way

16:02.095 --> 16:04.331
because that's how
they've always been.

16:04.364 --> 16:07.234
**

16:07.267 --> 16:09.102
Hmm.

16:12.139 --> 16:13.173
'Sup?

16:13.773 --> 16:15.608
My favorite class
is recess.

16:17.644 --> 16:20.747
Hey, great job
at being regular.
You too.

16:20.780 --> 16:23.616
It was silly of us to compete
for Ms. Doris' attention.

16:23.650 --> 16:26.386
Let's never let a teacher
come between us again.

16:26.419 --> 16:27.987
**

16:30.823 --> 16:32.392
What is that?

16:32.425 --> 16:33.393
I'm weak!

16:33.426 --> 16:35.095
Give me that jersey!
Aah!

16:35.128 --> 16:38.131
Hey, hey!
No fighting in my classroom!

16:38.165 --> 16:40.133
You know what?
That's it!

16:40.167 --> 16:45.372

16:45.405 --> 16:47.340
This is going
on our permanent record.

16:47.374 --> 16:49.209
Goodbye, Yale.
Hello, Georgia Tech.

16:49.242 --> 16:52.645
Hey!
No talking in detention.

16:55.115 --> 16:57.184
Oh, thanks.

16:57.217 --> 16:58.551
I didn't wanna bend down.

16:58.585 --> 17:01.088
No problem.
Do you need anything else?

17:01.121 --> 17:03.790
Yeah.
There's, uh...

17:03.823 --> 17:06.493
there's lots of penises
drawn on the back board.

17:06.526 --> 17:08.795
You can try to erase those.

17:08.828 --> 17:10.230
Of course!

17:10.263 --> 17:11.298
If you've got any spray,

17:11.331 --> 17:14.334
I can also hit the faint
outlines of the shadow ones.

17:14.367 --> 17:17.070
You can try, but I don't
think that spray works.

17:17.104 --> 17:20.740
I've been using it forever,
and they just don't go away.

17:20.773 --> 17:23.243
That's because you need
to use a microfiber towel.

17:23.276 --> 17:25.412
But I don't have a micro--

17:25.445 --> 17:28.348
You -- You boys are great.

17:28.381 --> 17:30.283
Are you sure you belong here?

17:30.317 --> 17:31.251
We don't.

17:31.284 --> 17:33.653
But maybe we do.

17:33.686 --> 17:36.289
We weren't the problem.

17:36.323 --> 17:37.524
It was Ms. Doris.

17:37.557 --> 17:39.492
She's the one who messed up.

17:40.393 --> 17:42.395
Can I help empty
the trash can?

17:42.429 --> 17:44.664
Nice try, Stripes.
My name's Jordan.

17:44.697 --> 17:47.534
Stop trying to humanize
yourself, okay, Stripes?

17:53.773 --> 17:55.242
Hey.

17:55.275 --> 17:56.576
Stay away, Louis.

17:56.609 --> 17:57.877
I'm going
to the book reading.

17:57.910 --> 17:59.746
I know. I was hoping
I could give you a ride.

17:59.779 --> 18:01.781
No.
I thought you might say that,

18:01.814 --> 18:04.151
so I hid your tire.

18:04.184 --> 18:07.454
**

18:07.487 --> 18:08.821
Where's my tire?!

18:08.855 --> 18:10.457
You don't want
to keep Terry waiting.

18:15.228 --> 18:19.766
Just so you know,
I brought both.

18:24.571 --> 18:25.405
Where are you going?

18:25.438 --> 18:27.274
B. Dalton Bookseller
is the other way.

18:27.307 --> 18:29.776
I wanted to make a pit stop.

18:29.809 --> 18:32.379
At a car wash?

18:32.412 --> 18:34.647
I thought the car
was looking a little dirty.

18:34.681 --> 18:37.684
I miss washing the car
with you

18:37.717 --> 18:39.286
because it was something
we did together

18:39.319 --> 18:41.854
back when we had more time
for each other.

18:41.888 --> 18:44.724
But I was only looking at it
from my side.

18:44.757 --> 18:46.793
I understand you have
your book now and you're busy,

18:46.826 --> 18:47.860
and I'm all for that.

18:47.894 --> 18:50.197
So to show my support,

18:50.230 --> 18:52.265
I got you a package
of gift certificates

18:52.299 --> 18:53.900
for 10 automatic car washes.

18:53.933 --> 18:57.570
That's very thoughtful,
but it is too extravagant.

18:57.604 --> 18:59.606
It was free with
our grocery rewards points.

18:59.639 --> 19:02.775
Oh, Louis.
That's so sweet.

19:02.809 --> 19:05.312
You will always be
a priority for me.

19:06.346 --> 19:08.248
I miss spending time
with you, too.

19:09.282 --> 19:11.518
And I'm sorry I put
electricity through your body.

19:11.551 --> 19:12.652
Oh, it's okay.

19:12.685 --> 19:13.953
It was
only a second-degree burn.

19:13.986 --> 19:15.355
It'll heal.

19:15.388 --> 19:17.324
Not as fast as skin
that hasn't been burned,

19:17.357 --> 19:18.925
but still, it'll heal.

19:20.660 --> 19:23.263
All this exciting stuff
is happening with your book,

19:23.296 --> 19:24.664
and your life is expanding.

19:24.697 --> 19:26.799
I guess, deep down,
I was scared

19:26.833 --> 19:29.402
that you're gonna
leave me behind,

19:29.436 --> 19:31.904
like Chrissie Shrimpton.
Who's that?

19:31.938 --> 19:34.407
Mick Jagger's girlfriend
before he became a huge star.

19:34.441 --> 19:36.676
I'll never leave you behind.

19:36.709 --> 19:40.280
I am
a beautiful Mylar balloon,

19:40.313 --> 19:43.883
and you're the lug nut
that keeps me grounded.

19:43.916 --> 19:47.454
If anything,
you're my Dorothea Hurley.

19:47.487 --> 19:49.322
Who's that?
Bon Jovi's wife.

19:49.356 --> 19:50.723
He married
his high-school sweetheart,

19:50.757 --> 19:52.392
and they're still together.

19:52.425 --> 19:54.594
And Bon Jovi
could have anybody.

19:54.627 --> 20:01.601
**

20:06.873 --> 20:08.641
And there was this one stubborn
shadow-P we couldn't get,

20:08.675 --> 20:10.643
so we turned it
into a dog profile.

20:10.677 --> 20:12.679
Mr. Carlson was so thrilled,

20:12.712 --> 20:14.947
he ripped up the detention
slips and let us go.

20:14.981 --> 20:16.683
Yale is still in play.

20:16.716 --> 20:18.651
Mr. Carlson from detention?

20:18.685 --> 20:19.952
He hated my guts.

20:19.986 --> 20:21.488
Well, he loved us.

20:21.521 --> 20:23.690
Gave us a couple Zippos
from the lost and found.

20:23.723 --> 20:25.458
Mine has a shamrock on it.

20:25.492 --> 20:27.527
Anyway, we just wanted
to say thank you.

20:27.560 --> 20:29.729
For what?
You told us to be regular.

20:29.762 --> 20:30.930
This is our regular.

20:30.963 --> 20:32.732
Ms. Doris may not like us,

20:32.765 --> 20:35.935
but as long as 99%
of authority figures do,

20:35.968 --> 20:37.404
that's still an A-plus.

20:37.437 --> 20:38.805
Not everyone
has to like everyone.

20:38.838 --> 20:40.540
Word.

20:40.573 --> 20:42.509
Did you guys know
Mom has a gun?

20:44.711 --> 20:47.714
It's hard to believe
the Michelin Man

20:47.747 --> 20:49.516
is made up
of a bunch of these.

20:49.549 --> 20:52.919
Huh. I never really thought
about that, but yeah.

20:52.952 --> 20:54.321
Why is he white, though?

20:54.354 --> 20:55.187
Shouldn't he be black?

20:55.221 --> 20:57.324
Let's not get into
that whole thing.

20:57.357 --> 20:59.326
We're having a nice time.

21:01.761 --> 21:04.831
What's the rush?

21:04.864 --> 21:06.533
Don't you have work to do?

21:06.566 --> 21:07.534
Oh, it can wait.

21:13.340 --> 21:14.474
Oh, I got a queen!

21:14.507 --> 21:16.943
-Ah.

21:16.976 --> 21:20.580
Aww. Those two kids
are gonna make it after all.

21:22.014 --> 21:25.017
