<i>HOW TO FEEL RIGHT NOW.</i>

23:05.685 --> 23:07.885
<i>I'M SORRY FOR HIM,</i>
<i>I'M SORRY FOR ME,</i>

START ALL OVER.

23:09.722 --> 23:11.322
I'VE INSURED MYSELF FOR THAT,
BUT STILL.

23:11.324 --> 23:14.925
INSURED YOURSELF?
SO YOU THOUGHT
THERE WAS A CHANCE

23:14.927 --> 23:17.495
J-ME MIGHT NOT FINISH
THE FILM? WHY?

23:17.497 --> 23:18.863
BECAUSE
HE COULD'VE RELAPSED.

23:18.865 --> 23:20.564
HE DIDN'T GET CLEAN
FOR HIMSELF.

23:20.566 --> 23:22.133
HE DID IT
FOR HIS COMEBACK.

23:22.135 --> 23:23.567

ON KILLING J-ME,

MAKE HER MOVIE ALL OVER AGAIN.

AND IF WE COULDN'T GET
A URINE SAMPLE,

24:06.145 --> 24:07.778
THEN A VIDEO OF A DRUG DEAL
WOULD HAVE DONE THE SAME THING.

24:07.780 --> 24:09.380

YOU SAID YOU NEEDED HIM.

24:09.382 --> 24:10.848
NOW IT SOUNDS LIKE

24:10.850 --> 24:12.516
YOU WERE READY TO TOSS J-ME
OFF YOUR PROJECT.

24:12.518 --> 24:13.984
I MEAN,
DON'T GET ME WRONG --

24:13.986 --> 24:15.319
WHEN J-ME WAS WORKING WITH ME,
HE WAS FANTASTIC,

24:15.321 --> 24:16.520
BUT I JUST GOT TO THE POINT

24:16.522 --> 24:18.122
WHERE HE COULDN'T BE TRUSTED
ANYMORE,

24:18.124 --> 24:20.090
SO IF I COULD'VE SWITCHED HIM
OUT FOR SOMEONE RELIABLE,

24:20.092 --> 24:21.759
THEN, YES,
I WAS READY TO DO THAT.

<i>AND HE GOT HIS ASS KICKED</i>

OF THE STORY.
