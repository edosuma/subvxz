00:19.753 --> 00:22.187
You ever get the feeling
that everything in America...

00:22.255 --> 00:24.689
is completely fucked up?

00:24.758 --> 00:26.191
You know that feeling?

00:26.259 --> 00:29.023
The whole country is one inch
away from saying...

00:29.095 --> 00:31.188
"That's it! Forget it!"

00:31.264 --> 00:34.199
Think about it.
Everything's polluted--

00:34.267 --> 00:37.862
the environment, the government,
the schools--you name it.

00:37.971 --> 00:39.404
Speaking of schools...

00:39.472 --> 00:41.201
I was walking the hallowed halls
the other day...

00:41.307 --> 00:42.740
and I asked myself...

00:42.809 --> 00:44.743
"Is there life
after high school...

00:44.811 --> 00:46.244
"because I can't face
tomorrow...

00:46.312 --> 00:48.746
"let alone a whole year
of this shit."

00:48.815 --> 00:50.908
Yeah, you got it, folks.

00:50.984 --> 00:53.248
It's me again
with a little attitude...

00:53.319 --> 00:55.753
for all you out here
in white-bread land...

00:55.822 --> 00:57.255
all you nice people...

00:57.323 --> 00:59.757
livin' in the middle
of America the beautiful.

00:59.826 --> 01:03.193
Let's see, we're on 92 FM...

01:03.263 --> 01:06.198
and it feels like a nice,
clean little band so far.

01:06.266 --> 01:10.202
No one else is using it
and the price is right.

01:10.270 --> 01:11.737
And, yes, folks, you guessed it.

01:11.805 --> 01:13.739
Tonight, I'm as horny
as a ten-peckered owl...

01:13.807 --> 01:16.241
so stay tuned
because this is Hard Harry...

01:16.309 --> 01:19.710
reminding you to eat
your cereal with a fork...

01:19.813 --> 01:22.611
and do your homework
in the dark.

01:46.372 --> 01:48.306
Hey! Gimme that.

01:48.374 --> 01:50.308
Hey, man, let me see that.

01:50.376 --> 01:52.310
Give it on over here.

01:52.378 --> 01:54.141
He played Ice-T on this tape.

01:54.214 --> 01:56.307
Great. Plays Ice-T
and talks about his dick.

01:56.382 --> 01:57.815
Nah, man.
Ice-T shreds on this.

01:57.884 --> 01:59.545
I heard it last night.

02:17.036 --> 02:19.095
Mr. Chavez? Luis Chavez?

02:19.205 --> 02:20.638
Yes, just for a second.

02:24.377 --> 02:26.811
All right, so I'll    pick you up
after yearbook?

02:26.880 --> 02:27.972
OK, Dad.

02:28.047 --> 02:29.309
And no big dates tonight.

02:29.382 --> 02:32.146
Be well-rested
for your history exam tomorrow.

02:32.218 --> 02:33.651
-OK.
-Yo, Paige!

02:35.655 --> 02:37.316
Any time, anywhere, beautiful.

02:37.390 --> 02:38.379
Mr. Paige.

02:38.458 --> 02:41.427
Miss Paige Woodward arriveth.

02:41.494 --> 02:44.292
So rich, so smart...

02:44.364 --> 02:45.456
So perfect.

02:45.532 --> 02:47.466
Cheryl, good to see you.

02:47.534 --> 02:50.697
Gonna see the principal
this morning, huh?

02:56.109 --> 02:59.044
Mr. Murdock, can you tell me
what this is about?

02:59.112 --> 03:00.579
We'll see.

03:00.680 --> 03:02.614
Excuse me, Mrs. Creswood.

03:05.084 --> 03:06.312
Check this out.

03:06.386 --> 03:07.478
What is it?

03:07.554 --> 03:08.987
It's this guy.

03:09.055 --> 03:11.489
He's got a pirate
radio station on the air.

03:11.558 --> 03:14.823
His name is
"Happy Harry Hard-on."

03:14.894 --> 03:16.327
He's a total sex maniac.

03:16.396 --> 03:17.488
Of course.

03:17.564 --> 03:20.032
He comes on every night
at 10:00.

03:33.112 --> 03:34.739
Down to business.

03:36.783 --> 03:39.377
I got my Wild Cherry
Diet Pepsi...

03:39.452 --> 03:42.387
and I got my Blackjack gum here.

03:42.455 --> 03:43.922
And I got that feeling.

03:44.958 --> 03:46.391
Yeah, that familiar feeling...

03:46.459 --> 03:48.893
that something rank
is going down out there.

05:32.865 --> 05:35.959
Yeah, I can smell it.

05:36.035 --> 05:38.503
I can almost taste it--
the rankness in the air.

05:38.571 --> 05:40.505
It's everywhere.

05:40.573 --> 05:43.667
It's running through
that old pipeline out there...

05:43.776 --> 05:45.505
trickling along
that dumb concrete river...

05:45.578 --> 05:47.341
and coming up
through the drains...

05:47.413 --> 05:49.881
of those lovely tract homes
we all live in.

05:49.949 --> 05:51.507
So who is he?

05:51.584 --> 05:52.846
He goes to Humphrey.

05:52.919 --> 05:54.511
I mean, I don't know.

05:54.587 --> 05:58.523
Everywhere I look,
it seems everything is sold-out.

05:59.759 --> 06:02.626
They say this is where
the reception is the coolest.

06:02.695 --> 06:04.822
Then he probably lives
right around here.

06:06.032 --> 06:07.499
Fuckin' yuppies.

06:07.567 --> 06:10.035
My dad sold out...

06:10.103 --> 06:12.867
and my mom sold out years ago
when she had me.

06:12.972 --> 06:14.633
And then they sold me out...

06:14.741 --> 06:16.368
when they brought me
to this hole in the world.

06:16.476 --> 06:18.467
Hey, they made me
everything I am today...

06:18.578 --> 06:21.547
so, naturally,
I hate the bastards.

06:21.614 --> 06:23.047
Speaking of which...

06:23.116 --> 06:25.050
I'm running a contest...

06:25.118 --> 06:28.019
on the best way to put them
out of their miseries.

06:28.087 --> 06:29.520
Tonight,
we have number twelve...

06:29.589 --> 06:31.523
of one hundred things
to do with your body...

06:31.591 --> 06:33.024
when you're all alone.

06:34.427 --> 06:38.193
Now, are you ready
for the incredible sound...

06:38.264 --> 06:40.129
of Hard Harry
coming on his own face?

06:41.601 --> 06:43.535
Oh, my God.

06:43.603 --> 06:45.070
It's very possible, you know?

06:48.541 --> 06:49.803
Are you listening to this?

06:49.909 --> 06:51.069
Yeah, of course I'm listening.

06:51.144 --> 06:52.873
Guy's gotta have hair
coming out of his palms.

06:53.780 --> 06:56.044
This is a champion one.

06:56.482 --> 06:58.074
Oh. There. Yeah.

06:58.151 --> 06:59.311
Are you listening?

06:59.385 --> 07:01.250
-Yeah, I'm going blind.
-He's doing it.

07:01.320 --> 07:03.083
So unreal.

07:03.156 --> 07:04.953
Oh, my God.

07:05.024 --> 07:06.514
This...

07:14.200 --> 07:16.532
Yes, Hard Harry
will go to any length to keep...

07:16.602 --> 07:19.196
his three listeners glued
with ooey blooey to the radios.

07:19.305 --> 07:23.708
But the question is,
how far will you go?

07:23.810 --> 07:25.573
I mean, how far can you go...

07:25.645 --> 07:29.581
to amaze and disgust
the insatiable Hard Harry, huh?

07:29.649 --> 07:31.913
I mean, how serious are you?

07:32.985 --> 07:34.111
Hi, beautiful.

07:35.421 --> 07:37.082
You know
what I can't figure out?

07:37.156 --> 07:38.919
How you manage
to get such great grades...

07:38.991 --> 07:41.585
and you listen to that radio
all night, you know?

07:41.661 --> 07:44.755
Tomorrow, don't forget--
Yale interview.

07:44.831 --> 07:48.130
And I don't want you
to look too sleepy, you know?

07:48.201 --> 07:49.793
Good night, sweetie.

07:52.605 --> 07:54.038
Got a lot of letters
here, guys.

07:54.607 --> 07:56.040
Here. "Dear Hard Harry...

07:56.175 --> 07:58.439
"my boyfriend
won't talk to me anymore.

07:58.711 --> 08:01.077
"How do I show him
that I really love him?"

08:01.147 --> 08:02.580
Look, I don't know anything...

08:02.648 --> 08:04.582
about these letters
asking for love advice.

08:04.650 --> 08:06.413
lf I knew anything about love...

08:06.486 --> 08:08.078
I would be out there
making it...

08:08.154 --> 08:10.145
instead of sitting in here
talking to you guys.

08:10.223 --> 08:15.092
No. Just send me stuff
at Box 2710...

08:15.161 --> 08:19.621
U.S.A. Mail, Paradise Hills,
Arizona, 84012.

08:19.699 --> 08:21.724
Reply is guaranteed.

08:21.801 --> 08:23.098
"Dear Harry...

08:23.169 --> 08:25.137
"I think you're boring
and obnoxious...

08:25.204 --> 08:27.138
"and have a high opinion
of yourself."

08:27.206 --> 08:28.639
Of course, some of you
are probably thinking...

08:28.708 --> 08:30.232
I sent this from myself.

08:30.343 --> 08:33.278
"I think school is OK
if you just look at it right.

08:33.379 --> 08:34.812
"I mean, I like your music...

08:34.881 --> 08:36.644
"but I really
just don't see why...

08:36.716 --> 08:39.082
"you can't be cheerful
for one second."

08:39.150 --> 08:41.142
I'll tell you, since you asked.

08:41.320 --> 08:44.619
I just arrived
in this stupid suburb.

08:45.558 --> 08:47.822
I have no friends...

08:47.894 --> 08:49.225
no money...

08:49.295 --> 08:50.455
no car...

08:50.530 --> 08:52.157
no license.

08:52.231 --> 08:54.165
And even if I did
have a license...

08:54.233 --> 08:56.667
all I could do is drive out
to some stupid mall.

08:56.736 --> 08:57.998
Maybe if I'm lucky...

08:58.104 --> 09:00.538
play some fuckin' video games,
smoke a joint, and get stupid.

09:00.606 --> 09:03.598
You see,
there's nothing to do anymore.

09:03.709 --> 09:05.301
Everything decent's been done.

09:05.378 --> 09:07.642
All the great themes
have been used up...

09:07.713 --> 09:09.237
turned into theme parks.

09:09.315 --> 09:12.478
So I don't really find it
exactly cheerful...

09:12.552 --> 09:16.488
to be living in the middle of
a totally exhausted decade...

09:16.556 --> 09:18.649
where's there's nothing
to look forward to...

09:18.724 --> 09:20.521
and no one to look up to.

09:23.563 --> 09:25.531
That was deep.

09:27.433 --> 09:30.459
Oh, no. Not again.

09:30.903 --> 09:32.336
The creature stirs.

09:32.438 --> 09:35.430
Oh, God, I think
it's gonna be a gusher.

09:35.541 --> 09:37.907
This is the sixth time
in an hour.

09:37.977 --> 09:39.672
Oh, God.

09:39.745 --> 09:42.077
He sounds like
a chronic masturbator.

09:42.148 --> 09:43.274
He prides himself on it.

09:43.449 --> 09:45.383
See? I have to take care of it.

09:45.918 --> 09:48.853
Or else I'm going to explode.

09:48.921 --> 09:51.947
Just excuse me while l...

10:03.603 --> 10:04.900
Oh, my God, this is the biggest.

10:06.005 --> 10:07.700
Whoa, Nellie! Whoa!

10:07.807 --> 10:09.604
God! I'm gonna explode!

10:09.675 --> 10:11.233
Oh, take cover, Arizona!

10:11.344 --> 10:11.901
Here l--

10:12.011 --> 10:13.603
Any time now, man.

10:13.713 --> 10:15.112
Oh, God.

10:16.682 --> 10:18.240
Oh, God, it's the best.

10:18.317 --> 10:21.252
Oh, God, yeah.

10:21.354 --> 10:22.787
Free at last.

10:22.855 --> 10:25.449
I'm beat. I'm whipped.
Quittin' time.

10:25.558 --> 10:27.583
Gotta recuperate.

10:27.660 --> 10:28.922
There he goes.

10:28.995 --> 10:30.519
Sometimes he's on
for five minutes...

10:30.630 --> 10:32.063
sometimes he's on
for five hours.

10:32.231 --> 10:33.459
That's my man.

10:55.254 --> 10:58.087
God, I feel
so out of touch here.

10:58.190 --> 11:02.217
Honey, we didn't move out here
to stay in touch.

11:02.328 --> 11:04.819
Then why did we move out here?

11:04.997 --> 11:07.557
Because
it's a nice place to live.

11:07.633 --> 11:09.533
I'm making good money...

11:09.702 --> 11:11.226
and I'm the youngest
school commissioner...

11:11.303 --> 11:12.531
in the history of Arizona.

11:12.705 --> 11:13.831
Brian, you know what?

11:13.939 --> 11:16.203
The man I married loved
his work, not power and money.

11:16.308 --> 11:17.798
That's all right.
I still love my work.

11:18.010 --> 11:19.409
And I love power and money.

11:19.779 --> 11:21.076
When you were
young radical Brian...

11:21.213 --> 11:22.646
you were always fighting
against the system...

11:22.782 --> 11:23.544
and now you are the system.

11:23.816 --> 11:25.306
Now I am the system, yeah.

11:26.719 --> 11:28.209
Is that a beer?

11:29.622 --> 11:30.680
Sure.

11:31.223 --> 11:32.781
Have you noticed
his behavior lately?

11:33.092 --> 11:33.956
What about him?

11:34.160 --> 11:36.060
He's just so unhappy here.

11:40.833 --> 11:42.733
I'll go talk to him.

12:06.859 --> 12:08.087
What's up?

12:08.661 --> 12:10.390
I was just looking
for some stamps.

12:10.629 --> 12:12.358
Oh, fine. I got some right here.

12:14.200 --> 12:16.191
Going to send a letter to
one of your friends back east?

12:16.435 --> 12:19.927
No. I thought I might send away
for an inflatable date.

12:21.340 --> 12:22.307
You know, one of these days...

12:22.408 --> 12:24.069
you're gonna outsmart yourself,
young man.

12:24.677 --> 12:26.838
I love it when you
call me "young man."

12:27.146 --> 12:28.306
You know, when I was your age...

12:28.347 --> 12:30.679
I was on all the teams
and a bunch of clubs.

12:30.983 --> 12:32.143
Look, all I'm saying is...

12:32.284 --> 12:34.650
that school must have some
really terrific programs.

12:34.754 --> 12:35.482
It's very highly rated.

12:35.788 --> 12:37.915
Just save it for the masses, OK?

12:39.058 --> 12:41.788
Mark, they've got twelve hundred
students at that school.

12:41.827 --> 12:44.295
Certainly,
some of them got to be cool.

12:44.563 --> 12:46.656
Look, the deal is,
I get decent grades...

12:46.766 --> 12:48.700
you guys leave me alone, right?

13:06.852 --> 13:07.910
OK, who is this guy?

13:08.387 --> 13:09.615
I don't know.

13:09.922 --> 13:13.358
Nobody knows who he is, but he
really hates this school...

13:13.425 --> 13:14.756
so I guess he goes here.

13:14.994 --> 13:17.360
Yeah, but all the guys
that go here are geeks.

13:17.763 --> 13:19.162
Maybe not, my dear.

13:21.133 --> 13:22.327
Later.

13:22.535 --> 13:23.661
Later.

13:29.108 --> 13:31.702
"And so then
the Logicars questioned...

13:31.744 --> 13:34.508
"the few remaining Despars
more and more.

13:34.880 --> 13:36.148
"They began to fade away...

13:36.148 --> 13:38.116
"until there was nothing
left of them...

13:38.751 --> 13:43.051
"and they disappeared
from the face of the Earth."

13:45.891 --> 13:47.290
Pretty good, huh?

13:47.793 --> 13:51.024
Leading with your heart,
not your mind.

13:51.130 --> 13:53.724
Mark, I wondered
if you'd tell us...

13:53.833 --> 13:55.801
what you were thinking
about when you wrote this.

13:56.702 --> 13:59.830
I just wrote it late last night.

14:00.206 --> 14:02.572
That's obvious.
It's practically illegible.

14:04.310 --> 14:09.145
I was hoping that you'd share
your feelings about it.

14:16.755 --> 14:18.245
Saved by the bell.

14:18.490 --> 14:20.287
Don't think if I didn't
read your composition...

14:20.359 --> 14:21.621
it won't be read.

14:26.198 --> 14:28.689
They're looking for new writers
at the Clarion.

14:28.834 --> 14:30.859
Don't be embarrassed
of your talent.

14:33.205 --> 14:34.433
-Hey, Paige.
-Hiya, Paige.

14:36.408 --> 14:39.809
Hey, I finally got my new Miata.

14:39.912 --> 14:41.880
You should hear the cd player.

14:42.081 --> 14:42.843
It's unbelievable.

14:42.948 --> 14:44.245
Tennis team's throwing
a party tonight.

14:44.283 --> 14:45.807
Later, Paige.

14:46.385 --> 14:47.113
See you there.

14:47.186 --> 14:48.153
See ya.

14:50.623 --> 14:52.853
Hey, that's my box.
How's about asking, huh?

15:23.822 --> 15:24.846
Good morning, Mr. Murdock.

15:25.090 --> 15:25.647
Good morning, sir.

15:26.959 --> 15:28.893
I'm not stupid, you know.

15:29.862 --> 15:32.126
School is judged
on one category only.

15:32.197 --> 15:33.858
Academic schools.

15:34.767 --> 15:37.395
The lesson
of modern education is...

15:37.603 --> 15:41.004
nothing good comes easily--
no pain, no gain.

15:41.240 --> 15:41.968
Excuse me, everyone.

15:42.241 --> 15:43.970
Miss Creswood,
you want to listen to this?

15:44.443 --> 15:46.911
It's the third tape this week.

15:46.979 --> 15:48.207
I can't believe it.

15:49.214 --> 15:50.408
Oh, Nellie!

15:50.516 --> 15:52.450
Oh, yeah, I'm gonna explode.

15:52.584 --> 15:54.347
Oh, take cover, Arizona!

15:55.054 --> 15:56.453
Here I come!

15:56.522 --> 15:58.513
Jan, this is no laughing matter.

16:00.459 --> 16:02.484
Enjoy.

16:04.396 --> 16:06.421
You're in my writing class,
right?

16:07.132 --> 16:08.292
Right.

16:09.168 --> 16:12.501
Yeah, I like Emerson.
She's pretty funky.

16:14.006 --> 16:15.439
Now you're in trouble.

16:21.513 --> 16:23.344
You owe twenty-five cents.

16:26.685 --> 16:28.983
"How to Talk Dirty
and lnfluence People"...

16:29.054 --> 16:31.284
by Lenny Bruce.

16:32.458 --> 16:34.323
Who's he?

16:35.828 --> 16:37.591
Any good?

16:37.997 --> 16:39.521
He's all right.

16:40.165 --> 16:41.757
Talk a lot?

16:44.036 --> 16:45.628
Not too much, no.

16:56.949 --> 16:59.850
Cute, but no way.

17:00.753 --> 17:01.879
Guess who?

17:02.054 --> 17:04.454
It's 10:00. Do you care
where your parents are?

17:04.923 --> 17:07.653
Because after all,
it is a jungle out there.

17:19.304 --> 17:20.464
I don't know.

17:20.539 --> 17:21.096
I mean, everywhere I look...

17:21.173 --> 17:23.607
it seems like someone's getting
butt-surfed by the system.

17:24.343 --> 17:27.141
My parents are always
talking about the system...

17:27.212 --> 17:29.544
and the Sixties
and how cool it was.

17:29.948 --> 17:32.416
Well, look at where
the Sixties got them, huh?

17:32.551 --> 17:33.779
Come on, people, now

17:33.886 --> 17:35.183
Smile on your brother

17:35.454 --> 17:37.251
Everybody get together

17:37.389 --> 17:39.721
Try to love one another
right now

17:40.526 --> 17:41.288
Tune in, turn it up!

17:41.393 --> 17:42.951
Now that was the Sixties.

17:44.363 --> 17:45.728
This is a song
for the Nineties...

17:45.798 --> 17:47.129
from my buddies The Descendants!

17:48.100 --> 17:50.568
Welcome to Der Wienerschnitzel.
may I take your order, please?

17:50.636 --> 17:51.568
Yeah. I want...

17:55.808 --> 17:57.605
Want whale sperm with that?

17:59.044 --> 18:01.410
Why don't we listen
to that one again, huh?

18:01.480 --> 18:03.710
Welcome to Der Wienerschnitzel.
May I take your order, please?

18:03.816 --> 18:04.783
Yeah. I want...

18:08.620 --> 18:10.110
You want whale sperm with that?

18:12.624 --> 18:14.751
I hate the Sixties,
I hate school...

18:14.827 --> 18:16.590
I hate principals.

18:16.662 --> 18:18.323
I hate vice principals...

18:18.564 --> 18:21.931
but my true, pure,
refined hatred...

18:22.034 --> 18:23.729
is reserved
for guidance counselors.

18:25.137 --> 18:28.106
Happy Harry just happens
to have in his very hands...

18:28.173 --> 18:30.937
a copy of a memo written
by one Mr. David Deaver...

18:31.009 --> 18:33.534
guidance counselor
extraordinaire...

18:33.645 --> 18:36.409
to one Miss Loretta Creswood,
high school principal.

18:37.783 --> 18:39.774
"I find Cheryl unremorseful...

18:39.852 --> 18:41.513
"about her unfortunate
condition."

18:42.554 --> 18:44.749
Bastard can't even say
she's knocked up.

18:46.658 --> 18:47.784
What channel?

18:49.661 --> 18:52.186
"And she's unwilling
to minimize its effect...

18:52.264 --> 18:54.858
"on the morale
of the student population."

18:55.067 --> 18:56.125
Guidance counselors.

18:56.235 --> 18:58.430
lf they knew anything
about career moves...

18:58.504 --> 19:00.631
would they have ended up
as guidance counselors?

19:01.440 --> 19:03.271
What do you say
we call Deaver up, huh?

19:03.375 --> 19:05.502
Hard Harry
just happens to have...

19:06.311 --> 19:08.211
the home phone numbers
of every employee...

19:08.280 --> 19:11.374
of the Paradise Hills
school commission.

19:13.218 --> 19:14.207
Here we go.

19:14.286 --> 19:16.720
There you are, Mr. Deavski.

19:21.226 --> 19:22.454
Deaver residence.

19:22.561 --> 19:23.357
David Deaver speaking.

19:23.529 --> 19:25.622
Hey, this is WKPS.
You're live.

19:25.697 --> 19:27.324
We're doing a piece
on high schools.

19:27.399 --> 19:29.196
We understand that you're
a guidance counselor.

19:29.434 --> 19:31.163
I'm head of guidance...

19:31.270 --> 19:34.637
here at Hubert Humphrey High
in Paradise Hills, Arizona.

19:34.740 --> 19:36.970
l've been here seven years.

19:37.609 --> 19:39.474
Could you tell us a bit
about what you do?

19:39.778 --> 19:44.909
I run a comprehensive
American values program.

19:46.018 --> 19:49.351
ln which we discuss...

19:49.454 --> 19:50.887
ethical situations...

19:50.923 --> 19:53.756
sex education,
drug awareness...

19:54.026 --> 19:57.052
What do you say to young people
who look around at the world...

19:57.396 --> 19:59.990
and see that it's become,
you know, like, a...

20:00.098 --> 20:02.396
a sleazy country, you know?

20:02.501 --> 20:03.968
A place you just can't trust.

20:04.169 --> 20:05.796
Like your school, for example.

20:05.871 --> 20:08.305
How come it wins
all of these awards...

20:08.373 --> 20:10.136
and yet students
are dropping out like flies?

20:10.209 --> 20:11.471
Why is that?

20:11.843 --> 20:15.210
Now, my listeners are curious
about your participation...

20:15.280 --> 20:17.373
in the decision
to expel Cheryl Biggs.

20:18.884 --> 20:21.478
l--l...

20:21.587 --> 20:24.784
I'm not aware
of anything like that.

20:24.890 --> 20:26.482
I don't know
what you're talking about.

20:26.792 --> 20:28.316
Well, that's not true, sir.

20:28.794 --> 20:30.591
"Cheryl refuses to
accept suggestions...

20:30.696 --> 20:32.630
"of a more positive
mental attitude...

20:32.731 --> 20:33.925
"towards her health
and her future.

20:34.032 --> 20:36.796
"I find no alternative
but to suggest suspension."

20:37.002 --> 20:39.732
Who is this?
How did you get this number?

20:40.005 --> 20:41.131
Do you admit it, sir?

20:41.273 --> 20:43.138
Admit what?

20:44.576 --> 20:46.043
That you're slime.

20:46.144 --> 20:47.202
Now, wait just a minute.

20:47.312 --> 20:50.213
You interview a student,
and then you rat on her.

20:50.315 --> 20:51.475
You betrayed her trust.

20:51.516 --> 20:53.848
lsn't that right, sir?

20:56.655 --> 21:00.489
Well, as you can see,
these guys are played out.

21:00.759 --> 21:02.852
Society is mutating
so rapidly...

21:02.995 --> 21:06.726
that anyone over the age
of twenty really has no idea.

21:07.666 --> 21:09.634
All right.
Back down to business.

21:09.901 --> 21:12.096
"I share a room
with my older brother.

21:12.504 --> 21:14.870
"Nearly every night
after he turns off his light...

21:14.973 --> 21:16.167
"he comes over to my bed...

21:16.241 --> 21:18.869
"and gives me
a few arm noogies and stuff.

21:18.977 --> 21:20.308
"And then he makes me
scratch his back...

21:20.345 --> 21:22.870
"and other refinements."

21:22.948 --> 21:26.543
Well, it's about time we had
some refinements on this show.

21:26.585 --> 21:29.110
"Then sooner or later,
he gets worked up...

21:29.187 --> 21:31.712
"and without further ado...

21:31.790 --> 21:34.987
"he rubs his thing
and makes me watch."

21:36.228 --> 21:37.991
Signed yourself "Screwed Up."

21:38.697 --> 21:41.131
Well, first of all,
you're not screwed up.

21:41.233 --> 21:44.828
You're an unscrewed-up reaction
to a screwed-up situation.

21:44.936 --> 21:47.200
Feeling screwed up
in a screwed-up place...

21:47.306 --> 21:51.208
in a screwed-up time does not
mean that you are screwed up.

21:51.310 --> 21:53.244
lf you catch my drift.

21:55.814 --> 21:58.339
Now, as you know,
dear listeners...

21:58.450 --> 22:03.080
if you enclose your number...

22:03.121 --> 22:04.986
a reply is guaranteed.

22:05.924 --> 22:08.051
This is Happy Harry Hard-on.
You're live.

22:08.160 --> 22:09.354
Is this Miss Screwed Up?

22:10.729 --> 22:12.162
I have a couple of questions.

22:12.230 --> 22:14.596
How big is this thing
you described?

22:14.633 --> 22:16.760
Is it bigger than a baby's arm?

22:18.136 --> 22:20.934
You don't remember
or you don't want to tell me?

22:23.241 --> 22:25.641
Or maybe you made
this whole thing up, huh?

22:25.877 --> 22:26.605
Remember, my dear...

22:26.678 --> 22:28.669
I can smell a lie
like a fart in a car.

22:34.886 --> 22:37.150
it's too bad
about that one, actually.

22:37.789 --> 22:39.654
You see, to me...

22:39.758 --> 22:41.555
the real truth
is always a bigger turn-on...

22:41.693 --> 22:43.422
and it doesn't have
to be a big deal.

22:43.528 --> 22:44.358
lt could be anything.

22:44.429 --> 22:47.489
Malcolm, have you finished
your homework yet?

22:49.768 --> 22:51.793
Your father and l
are downstairs watching TV.

22:51.937 --> 22:53.962
Why don't you come down
and join us for once?

22:56.041 --> 22:58.339
All right, Malcolm.
Have it your way.

22:59.778 --> 23:00.836
Thanks.

23:03.982 --> 23:05.142
So, I don't know.

23:05.217 --> 23:08.311
Send me your most pathetic
moment, your most anything.

23:08.420 --> 23:09.887
As long as its real.

23:09.988 --> 23:14.391
I want the size, the shape,
the feel, the smell.

23:14.459 --> 23:17.087
I mean I want blood, sweat,
and tears on these letters.

23:17.195 --> 23:22.132
I want brains and ectocasm
and come spilled all over 'em !

23:22.200 --> 23:23.531
Hallelujah!

23:26.872 --> 23:29.136
And now,
all my horny listeners...

23:29.241 --> 23:31.675
get one hand free, because...

23:33.178 --> 23:35.408
Yes, the "eat me,
beat me" lady is back.

23:36.681 --> 23:38.546
"Come in.

23:38.617 --> 23:41.984
"Every night, you enter me
like a criminal.

23:42.087 --> 23:43.213
"You break into my brain...

23:43.355 --> 23:46.085
"but you're
no ordinary criminal.

23:46.191 --> 23:49.354
"You put your feet up
and you pop a Pepsi...

23:49.461 --> 23:52.589
"you start to party,
you turn up my stereo...

23:52.697 --> 23:55.131
"songs l've never heard,
but I move anyway.

23:55.233 --> 23:57.667
"You get me crazy. I say do it.

23:57.769 --> 23:59.600
"I don't care what. Just do it.

23:59.771 --> 24:02.706
"Jam me, jack me,
push me, pull me, talk hard."

24:10.048 --> 24:11.310
I like that.

24:13.452 --> 24:14.578
Talk hard.

24:17.055 --> 24:20.991
I like the idea that a voice
can just go somewhere...

24:21.026 --> 24:23.392
uninvited...

24:23.462 --> 24:24.759
just kind of hang out...

24:24.896 --> 24:28.332
like a dirty thought
in a nice, clean mind.

24:28.433 --> 24:30.196
Maybe a thought
is like a virus, you know?

24:30.302 --> 24:33.362
lt can kill
all the healthy thoughts...

24:33.472 --> 24:34.632
and just take over.

24:34.739 --> 24:37.299
That would be serious.

24:37.375 --> 24:39.434
That would be totally serious.

24:39.544 --> 24:41.774
Yeah. I know that
all of my horny listeners...

24:41.847 --> 24:43.940
would love it if I would call up
the "eat me, beat me" lady...

24:44.082 --> 24:45.174
but no!

24:46.218 --> 24:47.947
Because she never
encloses her number.

24:48.053 --> 24:50.487
Tough luck, creepoid.

24:50.622 --> 24:53.056
Always the same red paper...

24:53.124 --> 24:56.184
the same beautiful
black writing.

25:00.799 --> 25:03.029
Now, she's probably
a lot like me--

25:03.201 --> 25:04.532
a legend in her own mind.

25:08.139 --> 25:10.198
But you know what?

25:10.909 --> 25:14.401
I bet in real life,
she's probably not that wild.

25:15.514 --> 25:17.004
I bet she's kind of shy...

25:17.048 --> 25:20.484
like so many of us,
briskly walking the halls...

25:21.987 --> 25:24.581
pretending to be late
for some class...

25:24.689 --> 25:26.350
pretending to be distracted.

25:27.225 --> 25:31.594
Hey, poetry lady,
are you really this cool?

25:31.730 --> 25:33.459
Are you out there?

25:33.632 --> 25:34.223
Are you listening?

25:34.466 --> 25:36.434
I'm always out here.

25:36.768 --> 25:40.704
I feel like I know you,
and yet we'll never meet.

25:43.208 --> 25:44.675
So be it.

25:44.843 --> 25:47.607
Here's a song from my close
personal buddies back east--

25:47.646 --> 25:49.841
The Beastie Boys.

25:49.915 --> 25:51.712
This is a song
that was so controversial...

25:51.783 --> 25:53.842
they couldn't put it
on their first album.

25:53.885 --> 25:55.512
Add a little night light.

25:57.589 --> 25:58.886
Well

25:59.024 --> 26:01.185
Chillin' at the corner
this one time

26:01.293 --> 26:03.693
Cool at the party,
you're runnin' a line

26:03.762 --> 26:06.094
Smokin' my crack,
sayin' my rhyme

26:06.164 --> 26:08.359
Countin' my pack
just to pass the time

26:08.600 --> 26:10.727
Many young girls do some base

26:10.802 --> 26:13.430
Her boyfriend Pete,
he was on my case

26:13.572 --> 26:14.596
Took him to the place

26:14.673 --> 26:16.106
Threw the mattress in his face

26:16.608 --> 26:18.974
Got homeboy in his fuckin' face

26:22.280 --> 26:25.113
I just love
being the rap king of Arizona.

26:26.384 --> 26:27.715
I don't know.

26:27.786 --> 26:29.811
Drugs are out. Sex is out.

26:29.888 --> 26:32.516
Politics are out.
Everything is on hold.

26:32.857 --> 26:35.621
We definitely
need something new.

26:36.227 --> 26:37.888
I just keep waiting
for some new voice...

26:38.029 --> 26:41.123
to come out of somewhere
and just say, "Hey!"

26:41.199 --> 26:44.191
"Wait a second. What is
wrong with this picture?

26:44.269 --> 26:46.829
"Just take a look around."

26:48.006 --> 26:50.770
Maybe this is the answer
to everything.

26:52.077 --> 26:53.772
Wouldn't that be nice, huh?

26:56.815 --> 26:58.180
"Dear Hard Harry...

26:58.249 --> 27:00.479
"do you think
I should kill myself?"

27:01.519 --> 27:02.645
Great.

27:04.889 --> 27:07.653
Signed "I'm Serious."

27:07.926 --> 27:11.453
And, of course,
there is a number here.

27:11.763 --> 27:13.424
Now, look...

27:22.507 --> 27:24.065
Hello. Serious?

27:25.877 --> 27:27.310
Are you OK?

27:27.879 --> 27:32.339
I guess what I'm asking is,
how serious are you?

27:32.817 --> 27:34.978
Or how you gonna do it?

27:35.520 --> 27:37.920
I'm gonna blow
my fuckin' head off.

27:39.057 --> 27:41.082
Well, do you have a gun?

27:41.226 --> 27:43.751
No, I'm gonna use my finger,
genius.

27:45.597 --> 27:50.227
All right, so, where's this
gonna take place, huh?

27:50.435 --> 27:51.561
Right here.

27:54.673 --> 27:56.664
Where is this alleged gun?

27:56.741 --> 27:58.675
Do you have it with you?

28:00.211 --> 28:02.441
Did you at least write a note?

28:03.448 --> 28:05.712
You have a reason, don't you?

28:06.384 --> 28:07.874
You're not gonna be
one of those people...

28:07.919 --> 28:10.046
who kills themselves,
and nobody has any idea...

28:10.221 --> 28:11.518
why they did it, huh?

28:11.923 --> 28:14.448
That's why we need a note, pal.

28:14.959 --> 28:16.756
I'm all alone.

28:18.463 --> 28:22.092
Hey, look, maybe it's OK
to be alone sometimes.

28:22.233 --> 28:24.531
I mean, I...

28:24.636 --> 28:26.035
Everybody's alone.

28:26.137 --> 28:27.798
You're not.

28:28.840 --> 28:31.172
I didn't talk
to one person today...

28:31.309 --> 28:33.641
not counting teachers.

28:35.547 --> 28:39.074
I sit alone every day, you know?

28:39.150 --> 28:42.051
Sit in the stairwell,
eating my lunch, reading a book.

28:42.353 --> 28:44.014
What about you?

28:52.130 --> 28:53.427
I hate that.

28:55.366 --> 28:56.390
Now I'm depressed.

28:57.235 --> 28:58.463
Now I feel
like killing myself...

28:58.536 --> 29:01.403
but luckily,
I'm too depressed to bother.

29:05.110 --> 29:09.012
Great. He's got the phone
off the hook now.

29:09.280 --> 29:13.273
Rejected again.
That's OK, I'm used to it.

29:13.551 --> 29:14.711
Terminal loneliness.

29:19.157 --> 29:21.557
People always think
they know who a person is...

29:21.693 --> 29:22.785
but they're always wrong.

29:23.328 --> 29:25.319
Eats lunch on stairs.

29:25.797 --> 29:28.789
Parents have no idea.

29:28.900 --> 29:31.266
Mine had me tested
because I sit...

29:31.336 --> 29:35.966
alone in my room all day,
naked, wearing only a cock ring.

29:40.411 --> 29:42.675
lt really bugs me.

29:42.781 --> 29:45.841
Everyone thinks they know
how a person should be.

29:47.051 --> 29:49.212
Who cares how I should be,
you know?

29:49.654 --> 29:52.851
ln real life, I could be
that anonymous nerd...

29:52.957 --> 29:55.118
sitting across from you
in chem lab...

29:56.528 --> 29:58.758
staring at you so hard, and...

30:00.799 --> 30:06.328
Then when you turn around,
he tries to smile...

30:06.404 --> 30:11.000
but the smile
just comes out all wrong.

30:11.176 --> 30:13.041
You just think, "How pathetic."

30:16.181 --> 30:17.842
Then he just looks away.

30:21.252 --> 30:23.550
He never looks
back at you again.

30:27.358 --> 30:29.223
Ah, hey.

30:29.327 --> 30:32.023
Who cares? That's my motto.

30:34.933 --> 30:37.697
Well, sleep tight, Cheryl.

30:37.869 --> 30:40.030
Sleep tight, Miss Refinements.

30:41.472 --> 30:43.406
Sleep tight, poetry lady.

30:47.512 --> 30:49.446
Sleep tight, Mr. Serious.

30:52.150 --> 30:55.176
Maybe you'll
feel better tomorrow.

31:01.159 --> 31:04.651
Hey, what's a cock ring?
lt sounds cool.

31:04.762 --> 31:05.729
How should I know?

31:05.830 --> 31:08.594
Maybe it's a ring
with a cock on it.

31:08.700 --> 31:10.429
But he said he was wearing it.

31:43.334 --> 31:44.494
How much you want for it?

31:44.636 --> 31:45.762
Five bucks each.

32:24.943 --> 32:26.911
Like your school, for example.

32:27.345 --> 32:28.812
How come it wins
all of these awards...

32:28.947 --> 32:30.676
and yet students
are dropping out like flies?

32:30.748 --> 32:32.181
Why is that, Mr. Deaver?

32:32.417 --> 32:34.942
My listeners are wondering
about your participation...

32:35.053 --> 32:36.145
What is this?

32:36.254 --> 32:37.118
I don't know, sir.

32:37.255 --> 32:38.847
Is that your tape?
Whose tape is this?

32:39.123 --> 32:39.714
I don't know, sir.

32:39.757 --> 32:40.917
I looked around, and someone
had slipped that on.

32:41.426 --> 32:43.394
You know, people,
this dancing is a privilege...

32:43.461 --> 32:45.429
and it'll be taken away
if it's abused.

32:45.530 --> 32:47.054
You understand that?

33:07.986 --> 33:10.318
What? What are you lookin' at?

33:30.875 --> 33:32.308
You got a stick of gum?

33:34.779 --> 33:36.542
"Blackjack."

33:40.685 --> 33:44.143
You really as horny
as a ten-peckered owl?

33:50.595 --> 33:52.859
Hi. My name's Nora.

33:52.930 --> 33:53.988
What's yours?

33:54.632 --> 33:55.599
Mark.

33:57.468 --> 34:00.096
Well, hi, Mark.

34:01.773 --> 34:03.638
Listen, I was gonna
cut fourth period.

34:03.708 --> 34:06.233
You want to join me for a smoke
in the art supply room?

34:06.477 --> 34:09.105
No, I can't. I gotta go. Sorry.

34:10.081 --> 34:11.446
Sorry.

34:16.120 --> 34:18.213
Boy, these damn tapes keep
popping up all over the place.

34:18.322 --> 34:19.755
They were playing this
out in the alcove.

34:20.558 --> 34:21.717
Who is this guy, anyway?

34:21.793 --> 34:23.226
Every day there's more graffiti.

34:23.561 --> 34:25.791
I don't know, but he's sure
turning the school upside-down.

34:27.130 --> 34:29.257
Has anyone seen Luis Chavez?

34:29.367 --> 34:30.356
He wasn't in my class today.

34:30.868 --> 34:31.766
Mine, either.

34:31.869 --> 34:32.527
Listen to this.

34:32.870 --> 34:36.431
...a memo, written
by one Mr. David Deaver...

34:36.641 --> 34:38.666
guidance counselor
extraordinaire...

34:38.743 --> 34:41.337
to one Miss Loretta Creswood,
high school principal.

34:41.813 --> 34:42.780
"I find Cheryl..."

34:42.980 --> 34:44.311
Turn that off.

34:45.149 --> 34:47.811
I have an announcement to make.

34:56.761 --> 35:00.060
I have some
very upsetting news.

35:04.302 --> 35:06.270
Last night...

35:06.370 --> 35:08.304
one of our students...

35:08.406 --> 35:10.966
Malcolm Kaiser...

35:11.042 --> 35:12.441
took his own life.

35:13.611 --> 35:15.909
For those of you who knew him...

35:15.980 --> 35:21.111
there will be a memorial service
at Dempsey Hall on Friday.

35:21.319 --> 35:22.149
I know it hurts.

35:23.421 --> 35:26.151
It's painful to lose someone.

35:26.824 --> 35:27.756
Six, seven, eight

35:28.059 --> 35:29.287
We've got spirit

35:29.393 --> 35:30.485
Yes, we do

35:30.595 --> 35:31.755
We've got spirit

35:31.963 --> 35:33.863
How 'bout you?

35:44.609 --> 35:46.042
We've got spirit

35:46.110 --> 35:47.202
Yes, we do

35:47.411 --> 35:48.742
We've got spirit

35:48.813 --> 35:50.781
How 'bout you?

36:55.813 --> 36:59.010
You're the voice crying out
in the wilderness.

36:59.083 --> 37:00.948
You're the voice
that makes my brain burn...

37:01.052 --> 37:03.384
and my guts go gooey.

37:03.421 --> 37:05.252
Yeah, you gut me.

37:05.389 --> 37:08.756
My insides spill on your altar
and tell the future.

37:09.026 --> 37:12.587
My steaming, gleaming guts
spell out your nature.

37:13.030 --> 37:16.761
I know you--
not your name, but your game.

37:16.834 --> 37:19.029
I know the true you.

37:19.503 --> 37:21.664
Come to me,
or I'll come to you.

37:21.906 --> 37:23.339
So, you are him.

37:25.910 --> 37:28.401
Don't worry. I'm not going
to bust you or anything.

37:29.513 --> 37:31.242
Aren't you going to ask
who I am?

37:31.449 --> 37:32.973
No, I don't think so. No.

37:33.851 --> 37:36.081
I'm the "eat me, beat me" lady.

37:36.654 --> 37:38.121
You don't believe me?

37:40.124 --> 37:43.389
I know you--
not your name, but your game.

37:43.461 --> 37:44.655
I know the true you.

37:45.496 --> 37:49.523
Come to me, or I'll come to you.

37:53.170 --> 37:56.196
Hey, relax. I'm not really
like that except when I am.

37:56.507 --> 37:58.498
Look, I really can't
handle this right now, OK?

37:58.743 --> 38:02.144
It's not your fault.
I was listening last night.

38:02.246 --> 38:04.146
I didn't think
he'd go through with it.

38:12.723 --> 38:15.453
We heard about Malcolm Kaiser.

38:15.660 --> 38:16.991
We're just wondering
if you knew him.

38:19.864 --> 38:21.422
No, not really.

38:23.200 --> 38:24.861
I'm going to ask you something.

38:25.369 --> 38:27.234
Your mother and l
have been talking...

38:27.438 --> 38:28.370
and I guess we realized that--

38:28.472 --> 38:30.633
Mark, basically, we thought...

38:30.741 --> 38:33.209
that you might benefit
from seeing a psychiatrist.

38:33.511 --> 38:34.773
Is it that obvious?

38:35.146 --> 38:37.341
No, honey, of course not.
We think you're perfect.

38:37.415 --> 38:40.748
lt just seems that here you're
so sad and lonely all the time.

38:41.252 --> 38:43.186
And we want you to feel
good about yourself.

38:43.554 --> 38:45.351
You have friends
in New York, hon.

38:45.456 --> 38:47.083
Are you trying to meet people
here at all?

38:47.291 --> 38:49.054
lt was never--

38:49.126 --> 38:50.286
I know this sounds stupid...

38:50.328 --> 38:53.491
but have you ever just walked
up to a girl here and said hi?

38:53.731 --> 38:55.892
Look, the girls here,
they're different.

38:56.033 --> 38:57.000
I can't talk to them.

38:57.568 --> 38:58.330
How are they different?

38:58.569 --> 39:00.628
I was talking to
your English teacher today--

39:00.838 --> 39:01.930
Come on, Dad, please.

39:02.039 --> 39:04.599
It's creepy enough there
without you snooping around.

39:04.809 --> 39:07.869
She says that you've got
a great promise as a writer...

39:08.179 --> 39:10.010
but that you're having
trouble concentrating.

39:10.681 --> 39:12.706
So, when is Johnny
going to concentrate, huh?

39:12.983 --> 39:15.474
Get happy, get a girlfriend...

39:15.586 --> 39:17.520
and then write
a best seller, huh?

39:17.888 --> 39:20.015
Fine! You don't listen.
You don't talk to me.

39:20.157 --> 39:21.556
You hate everything.

39:21.759 --> 39:23.317
I can't talk to you people.

39:23.427 --> 39:24.860
I'm certainly not going
to a shrink.

39:25.029 --> 39:28.089
Everybody's got problems,
not just you...

39:28.499 --> 39:31.024
but you won't solve them
if you don't communicate!

39:31.202 --> 39:33.136
You've got to talk to somebody!

39:33.838 --> 39:35.271
OK, he's gone.

39:35.740 --> 39:38.607
He's gone back downstairs.

39:39.944 --> 39:42.242
And so, family and friends
of Malcolm Kaiser...

39:42.313 --> 39:43.712
sadly come and go
into the night...

39:44.115 --> 39:45.980
even as phantom DJ Hard Harry...

39:46.050 --> 39:50.419
prepares to broadcast
anonymously from somewhere...

39:50.488 --> 39:52.854
in this formerly peaceful
community.

39:53.157 --> 39:56.388
Shep Sheppard reporting live
from Paradise Hills, Arizona.

39:56.527 --> 39:57.585
Back to you, Bill.

39:57.661 --> 39:59.356
Thank you, Shep, for that--

39:59.930 --> 40:01.397
Yeah, back to you.

40:25.990 --> 40:28.515
lf it be your will

40:31.262 --> 40:34.060
That I speak no more

40:36.133 --> 40:38.761
And my voice be still

40:41.238 --> 40:43.866
As it was before

40:46.177 --> 40:50.273
I will speak no more

40:50.381 --> 40:52.872
I shall abide

40:52.950 --> 40:54.315
Until

40:56.687 --> 40:59.485
I am spoken for

41:00.891 --> 41:03.325
lf it be your will

41:14.872 --> 41:17.807
You see,
I never planned it like this.

41:19.677 --> 41:22.305
My dumb dad got me
this shortwave radio set...

41:22.446 --> 41:25.711
so I could just speak
to my friends back east.

41:26.417 --> 41:28.578
But I couldn't reach anybody...

41:29.420 --> 41:31.854
so I just thought
I was talking to nobody.

41:32.456 --> 41:35.152
But I imagine nobody listening.

41:35.259 --> 41:38.126
Maybe I imagine
that one person out there.

41:39.029 --> 41:41.862
Anyway, one day I woke up...

41:41.999 --> 41:44.229
and I realized I was never
going to be normal...

41:45.970 --> 41:47.232
so I said, "Fuck it."

41:48.772 --> 41:50.706
I said, "So be it..."

41:52.843 --> 41:54.811
and Happy Harry Hard-on
was born.

41:55.412 --> 41:58.438
But I never meant
to hurt anyone.

41:58.649 --> 42:00.446
Honestly...

42:01.018 --> 42:03.782
I never meant to hurt anyone.

42:04.388 --> 42:06.083
I'm sorry, Malcolm.

42:07.024 --> 42:08.685
I never said...

42:09.360 --> 42:10.827
don't do it.

42:14.698 --> 42:15.858
I'm sorry.

42:18.903 --> 42:22.168
Anyway...that's it.

42:22.640 --> 42:23.800
The show's over.

42:26.043 --> 42:27.670
I'm done.

42:27.845 --> 42:29.312
Stick a fork in me.

42:29.380 --> 42:31.109
It's been grand.

42:31.215 --> 42:34.514
This is Hard Harry
saying sayonara.

42:34.585 --> 42:36.177
Over and out.

42:36.820 --> 42:38.685
Come on, you can't do this.

42:39.290 --> 42:40.689
This is a joke, right?

42:41.058 --> 42:44.221
Come on, Harry, baby,
don't stiff.

42:45.496 --> 42:46.963
What am I doing?

42:50.868 --> 42:51.857
Fuck it.

42:55.372 --> 42:59.331
You hear about some kid,
did something stupid--

43:00.911 --> 43:02.276
something desperate.

43:03.547 --> 43:05.538
What possessed him?

43:05.683 --> 43:07.674
How could he do
such a terrible thing?

43:08.719 --> 43:10.687
Well, come here.

43:10.788 --> 43:12.756
It's really quite simple,
actually.

43:15.726 --> 43:19.184
Consider the life
of a teenager, huh?

43:19.563 --> 43:22.191
You have parents and teachers
telling you what to do.

43:22.333 --> 43:25.791
You have movies, magazines,
and TV telling you what to do...

43:26.070 --> 43:28.698
but you know
what you have to do.

43:29.340 --> 43:31.069
Your job, your purpose...

43:31.208 --> 43:33.733
is to get accepted,
get a cute girlfriend...

43:33.844 --> 43:36.312
think up something great to do
for the rest of your life.

43:36.614 --> 43:39.913
What if you're confused
and can't imagine a career?

43:40.918 --> 43:43.751
What if you're funny-looking
and can't get a girlfriend?

43:44.054 --> 43:46.522
You see,
no one wants to hear it.

43:48.525 --> 43:50.425
But the terrible secret...

43:52.997 --> 43:56.489
is that being young...

43:56.700 --> 44:00.693
is sometimes less fun
than being dead.

44:01.238 --> 44:03.206
This is great.
He's making it worse.

44:03.507 --> 44:07.500
Suicide is wrong, but the
interesting thing about it...

44:07.645 --> 44:09.977
is how uncomplicated it seems.

44:10.848 --> 44:12.372
You know?

44:12.716 --> 44:14.980
There you are,
you got all these problems...

44:15.052 --> 44:19.989
swarming around in your brain,
and here is one simple--

44:20.057 --> 44:22.582
one incredibly simple solution.

44:23.160 --> 44:25.685
I'm just surprised it doesn't
happen every day around here.

44:25.796 --> 44:28.458
Now, they're going to say I said
offing yourself was simple...

44:28.699 --> 44:31.429
but no, no, no, it's not simple.

44:31.602 --> 44:34.332
Like everything else,
you have to read the fine print.

44:34.672 --> 44:38.768
For instance, assuming that
there is a Heaven...

44:38.942 --> 44:40.432
who would ever want to go there?

44:40.644 --> 44:42.373
You know?
I mean, think about it.

44:42.746 --> 44:45.408
It's cool. You're sitting there
up on this cloud.

44:45.516 --> 44:46.881
It's nice, you know, it's quiet.

44:46.984 --> 44:48.781
There's no teachers...

44:48.886 --> 44:50.820
there's no parents,
but guess what?

44:51.288 --> 44:53.051
There's nothing to do.

44:53.157 --> 44:54.852
It's fucking boring.

44:55.125 --> 44:57.650
Another thing to remember
about suicide...

44:57.828 --> 44:59.591
is that it is not
a pretty picture.

44:59.763 --> 45:01.663
First of all,
you shit your shorts.

45:01.765 --> 45:02.789
You know?

45:02.933 --> 45:04.525
So, there you are, dead.

45:04.802 --> 45:07.168
People are weeping
over you, crying.

45:07.271 --> 45:10.763
Girls you never spoke to
are saying, "Why? Why? Why?"

45:11.275 --> 45:12.970
And you have a load
in your shorts.

45:13.077 --> 45:15.602
That's the way I see it.
Sue me.

45:15.713 --> 45:18.477
Now, they're saying I shouldn't
think stuff like this.

45:18.615 --> 45:21.516
They're saying that something
is wrong with me...

45:21.618 --> 45:24.280
that I should be ashamed.

45:24.388 --> 45:26.083
Well...

45:26.223 --> 45:28.123
I'm sick of being ashamed.

45:28.225 --> 45:29.453
I mean, aren't you?

45:29.560 --> 45:31.027
Sick to death.

45:31.161 --> 45:34.289
I don't mind being
dejected and rejected...

45:34.565 --> 45:36.430
but I'm not going
to be ashamed about it.

45:36.567 --> 45:37.556
Hallelujah.

45:37.634 --> 45:38.965
At least pain is real.

45:39.069 --> 45:41.196
You look around,
and you see nothing is real...

45:41.371 --> 45:43.396
but at least pain is real.

45:43.507 --> 45:45.407
Even this show isn't real.

45:45.542 --> 45:47.533
This isn't me.
I'm using a voice disguiser.

45:47.711 --> 45:50.509
I'm a phony fuck
just like my dad.

45:50.714 --> 45:52.272
Just like anybody.

45:52.382 --> 45:56.318
The real me is just as worried
as the rest of you.

45:56.653 --> 45:58.746
They say I'm disturbed.

45:58.856 --> 46:00.915
Of course I'm disturbed!

46:01.024 --> 46:04.255
We're all disturbed,
and if we're not, why not?

46:04.361 --> 46:06.727
Doesn't this blend of
blindness and blandness...

46:06.830 --> 46:08.991
want to make you
do something crazy?

46:09.066 --> 46:10.727
Then why not do something crazy?

46:10.834 --> 46:12.597
lt makes a hell
of a lot more sense...

46:12.669 --> 46:14.534
than blowing
your fucking brains out!

46:14.671 --> 46:16.332
Go nuts! Go crazy!

46:16.440 --> 46:17.873
Get creative!

46:18.008 --> 46:19.873
You got problems?
You just chuck 'em.

46:19.977 --> 46:22.343
Nuke 'em !
They think you're moody?

46:22.412 --> 46:23.970
Make them think you're crazy.

46:24.281 --> 46:28.115
Make them think you might snap!
They think you've got attitude?

46:28.185 --> 46:29.618
You show them
some real attitude.

46:29.720 --> 46:31.415
I mean, go nuts!

46:31.522 --> 46:32.989
Get crazy!

46:33.090 --> 46:36.719
No more Mr. Nice Guy!

46:39.229 --> 46:40.423
Oh, God!

46:45.135 --> 46:46.432
God! Yeah!

47:04.955 --> 47:07.423
Happy Harry Hard-on!

48:01.745 --> 48:02.871
Time out.

48:17.394 --> 48:18.861
This is good.

48:20.631 --> 48:22.599
This is very, very interesting.

48:27.871 --> 48:30.305
Hi, it's me.
You're on the air.

48:30.407 --> 48:33.205
Are you willing
to tell my listeners...

48:33.343 --> 48:34.810
what you told me here
in this letter?

48:34.912 --> 48:36.812
I think they're ready
to handle it.

48:36.847 --> 48:38.644
I'm not ashamed.

48:38.849 --> 48:40.544
So, tell us what happened.

48:40.651 --> 48:43.620
This guy I knew, he invited me
up to the ridge...

48:44.588 --> 48:47.455
and, well,
I wasn't really sure why...

48:47.591 --> 48:49.889
but I was really happy,
because he's pretty cool.

48:50.027 --> 48:52.757
He's an athlete and everything.

48:52.863 --> 48:55.832
First of all, when was this,
and how old are you?

48:56.199 --> 48:57.393
Just before school.

48:57.501 --> 48:59.162
I'm sixteen.

48:59.303 --> 49:00.270
Go ahead.

49:04.908 --> 49:08.776
So, we get up there,
we take off our shirts...

49:09.146 --> 49:10.977
and we start fooling around.

49:11.949 --> 49:15.908
And then, I sort of told him
how much I liked him.

49:20.257 --> 49:22.191
He just smiled
and said he knew it.

49:22.326 --> 49:23.725
Then he says...

49:23.994 --> 49:27.430
"Why don't we take our pants off
and get a tan?"

49:27.564 --> 49:29.031
So I did it.

49:31.935 --> 49:33.061
But he stalled.

49:33.670 --> 49:34.967
Go ahead.

49:36.707 --> 49:38.265
And then two of his friends
showed up...

49:38.375 --> 49:41.310
and they were drinking beer
and laughing.

49:42.779 --> 49:46.271
And they took my clothes
and threw them up in the trees.

49:51.688 --> 49:53.155
I didn't know what to do.

49:53.256 --> 49:55.918
I started to cry, but...

49:56.026 --> 49:58.995
they just laughed at me,
so I stopped.

50:01.231 --> 50:03.461
Then they started
calling me things...

50:03.600 --> 50:05.966
but I don't even care
about that.

50:06.603 --> 50:08.400
I know I'm into guys, but...

50:10.741 --> 50:12.174
this was different.

50:12.976 --> 50:15.103
So, what did you do?

50:15.212 --> 50:16.543
Everything.

50:16.646 --> 50:18.773
Everything they told me.

50:18.949 --> 50:21.076
I'm calling the police.

50:21.151 --> 50:22.914
Fraud, pornography--

50:23.053 --> 50:25.613
he is just using
those poor kids.

50:26.456 --> 50:28.686
That's the thirteenth call
tonight.

50:28.825 --> 50:31.157
Sounds like kids
bullshitting to me.

50:31.261 --> 50:32.751
I don't know.

50:32.896 --> 50:34.659
Things like that happen
when you're a kid.

50:34.865 --> 50:36.162
You swallow it, Donny?

50:36.700 --> 50:39.100
I think you're forgetting what
it's like when you're young.

50:39.269 --> 50:40.531
Come on, Shep.

50:40.771 --> 50:43.001
He got some kid to call in with
some story they've concocted.

50:43.106 --> 50:44.266
lt isn't real.

50:44.508 --> 50:47.602
Who cares if it's real
if the people are riveted?

50:47.778 --> 50:48.938
Let's go.

50:49.279 --> 50:52.908
No. People are rebroadcasting
this thing over state lines.

50:53.050 --> 50:55.211
I think it's time
to bring in the feds.

50:55.318 --> 50:56.945
This is FCC jurisdiction.

50:57.120 --> 51:00.578
I feel bad that
I didn't even do anything.

51:00.690 --> 51:03.215
I didn't even say anything.

51:03.293 --> 51:05.921
Now he won't even talk to me.

51:05.962 --> 51:08.430
He won't even look at me.

51:08.565 --> 51:10.658
I'm pretty confused.

51:10.767 --> 51:11.791
Confused?

51:12.669 --> 51:13.727
You're not the one
who's confused.

51:13.837 --> 51:16.533
You sound like you know
exactly what's going on.

51:16.673 --> 51:19.471
lf anyone's confused,
it's those guys out there.

51:19.576 --> 51:23.068
I know,
but I think about him a lot.

51:23.180 --> 51:27.879
Sometimes I wonder why
one person is born one way...

51:27.984 --> 51:30.145
and another person
is born another way.

51:34.558 --> 51:36.287
Are you there?

51:38.762 --> 51:42.095
So, I guess you think
I'm a faggot wimp, right?

51:44.434 --> 51:47.403
I'm just thinking
how strong people can be...

51:49.339 --> 51:53.173
and how everyone is alike
in some way...

51:55.712 --> 51:58.943
and how everyone needs
the same things.

51:59.015 --> 52:01.575
So, what are we going to do
about all this?

52:01.751 --> 52:03.218
I don't know.

52:05.655 --> 52:07.919
That's the big question,
isn't it, huh?

52:08.024 --> 52:10.219
I guess nobody knows, huh?

52:10.961 --> 52:13.259
Well, that's tough. I got to go.

52:13.630 --> 52:14.597
See you.

52:17.868 --> 52:21.133
I guess we all got to go now.

52:21.204 --> 52:22.637
Good night, pal.

52:23.740 --> 52:25.230
Good night, friends.

53:36.846 --> 53:39.280
"Believe it or not, I care"?

53:39.449 --> 53:41.974
"Eight-thirty to three-thirty."
What's that?

53:42.252 --> 53:45.119
It's some new hotline
Deaver's setting up.

53:45.322 --> 53:46.619
Hey, it's eight-thirty
in the morning...

53:46.756 --> 53:48.519
so I guess it's OK
to kill myself.

53:48.692 --> 53:50.489
Oh, my God,
it's after three-thirty...

53:50.627 --> 53:52.458
so I guess I'm totally fucked.

54:06.977 --> 54:08.410
What are you doing?

54:09.779 --> 54:11.713
Tramp.

54:12.082 --> 54:13.640
Bitch.

54:13.817 --> 54:15.944
How's he getting
this information?

54:16.119 --> 54:18.883
I want all the locks
in the school changed.

54:19.155 --> 54:22.613
I want a list of every student
with relatives on the staff.

54:22.759 --> 54:25.626
Just found the graffiti
on the roof of the cafeteria.

54:25.729 --> 54:26.957
They're taking it down now.

54:27.063 --> 54:28.155
What's it say?

54:28.265 --> 54:30.631
"Creswood's a maggot pus wad."

54:32.102 --> 54:33.967
Hey, are you the guy
selling tapes of that guy?

54:34.037 --> 54:35.334
-Yeah.
-How much?

54:35.438 --> 54:36.564
Five bucks each.

54:36.673 --> 54:37.833
All right, let me have it.

54:37.941 --> 54:39.966
-There you go.
-Thanks, man.

54:40.277 --> 54:42.438
Selling pretzels, Donald?

54:42.545 --> 54:44.308
Nobody knows who he is.

54:44.414 --> 54:45.938
We don't believe you, Donald.

54:46.116 --> 54:48.676
I swear to God.
Nobody has any idea.

54:48.785 --> 54:52.744
Then you've got until the end
of the day to get an idea.

54:52.856 --> 54:56.758
And don't forget--
your file is under review.

54:58.561 --> 55:01.428
You better bring all your
enrollment files to my office.

55:09.673 --> 55:11.664
What did they do to you?

55:11.841 --> 55:13.240
-You Donald?
-Yeah.

55:13.343 --> 55:14.310
I'm Joey.

55:14.377 --> 55:16.436
Can you get me into the P.A.?

55:22.218 --> 55:23.549
Stay hard!

55:27.724 --> 55:30.192
All right! Yeah!

55:30.293 --> 55:31.851
The truth is a virus!

55:37.667 --> 55:39.362
That's it for music
in the alcove.

55:39.703 --> 55:41.671
And from now on...

55:41.771 --> 55:45.867
anyone caught defacing
school property is expelled.

55:46.109 --> 55:47.576
David Deaver speaking

55:47.677 --> 55:48.837
Who is this

55:48.945 --> 55:50.503
Who--who--who is this

55:51.348 --> 55:53.282
You just hold on a minute there

55:53.350 --> 55:55.113
David Deaver speaking

55:55.185 --> 55:56.413
David Deaver speaking

55:57.053 --> 55:58.850
What's happening?
What's going on?

55:59.055 --> 56:00.181
It's Mr. Deaver.

56:00.590 --> 56:02.421
David Deaver speaking

56:07.697 --> 56:09.130
Admit what

56:09.299 --> 56:10.459
lt won't stop.

56:10.533 --> 56:11.659
Turn the speaker system.

56:11.768 --> 56:13.201
Shut off the whole system.

56:13.370 --> 56:14.496
We can't!

56:25.749 --> 56:28.513
Shut down the whole school.

56:33.523 --> 56:36.185
You just--you just

56:41.064 --> 56:42.588
-All right, Randy.
-Check this out.

56:42.699 --> 56:44.894
You're the TV guy, right?
Want to interview me?

56:44.968 --> 56:46.959
Because I was listening
the first night it was on...

56:47.036 --> 56:48.025
and I'm amazing.

56:48.171 --> 56:48.967
Here. Plug it in.

56:49.239 --> 56:50.866
I used to go here, you know?

56:51.007 --> 56:53.134
But they kicked me out
for no reason.

56:53.443 --> 56:54.569
Know what I'm saying?

56:54.677 --> 56:57.771
Check it out.
School colors, you know?

56:57.947 --> 56:59.437
It's instant pep rally.

56:59.549 --> 57:02.017
The smog's getting worse
and worse in this town.

57:02.118 --> 57:03.244
Go down on him.

57:04.154 --> 57:05.178
Come here, you little--

57:05.855 --> 57:06.947
Mr. Murdock.

57:07.123 --> 57:09.057
Can you direct me to the office?

57:09.192 --> 57:10.284
Come on!

57:10.393 --> 57:11.883
This is Shep Sheppard
reporting live...

57:11.995 --> 57:14.429
from deep in the smoke
at Hubert Humphrey High.

57:16.032 --> 57:17.124
Sit down.

57:17.534 --> 57:19.297
Anybody mind if I smoke?

57:19.536 --> 57:21.128
You do understand
you're expelled.

57:21.571 --> 57:22.629
That's cool.

57:22.839 --> 57:25.171
I can quite legally expel you.

57:25.375 --> 57:28.674
Loretta, I'm already expelled.
Don't you remember?

57:28.812 --> 57:31.246
You booted me out
the first week for dress code.

57:31.514 --> 57:34.176
You're trespassing.
How'd you like to be arrested?

57:34.284 --> 57:36.013
That's cool, too, you know?

57:36.252 --> 57:37.810
Because I told them cameras
to wait.

57:37.921 --> 57:39.252
I got lots to tell them.

57:39.355 --> 57:41.323
Who's going to believe
anything you say?

57:41.458 --> 57:43.619
Who's going to believe you?

57:43.760 --> 57:45.284
Maybe Harry might.

57:49.532 --> 57:50.726
What are you doing?

57:50.867 --> 57:53.358
It's cool.
We're safe in here.

57:54.804 --> 57:55.896
Guess what I heard?

57:55.972 --> 57:57.064
What?

57:57.207 --> 57:59.300
That smug Paige Woodward...

57:59.375 --> 58:01.343
she burned up
all her shit last night...

58:01.511 --> 58:03.308
right after you suggested it.

58:03.780 --> 58:05.714
ln her kitchen!

58:06.149 --> 58:09.550
Her precious pearls
were flying like bullets.

58:09.886 --> 58:12.514
Her dad was unthrilled.

58:14.591 --> 58:16.058
What?

58:16.192 --> 58:17.557
This is out of control.

58:17.727 --> 58:19.661
Yes!

58:19.796 --> 58:22.321
Students are requested
to inform their parents...

58:22.432 --> 58:24.366
of an emergency meeting
tonight...

58:24.467 --> 58:25.934
with the PTA
and the school commissioner.

58:26.269 --> 58:28.362
That's it.

58:28.505 --> 58:30.530
It's over.
I just hope it isn't too late.

58:31.708 --> 58:33.107
Just leave me alone, OK?

58:33.276 --> 58:34.368
Please.

58:40.617 --> 58:42.778
Oh, yes.
D-D-David Deaver

58:42.919 --> 58:44.784
And I really, really
don't give a damn

58:44.888 --> 58:46.412
I really don't know anything

58:46.489 --> 58:47.854
Because I haven't got it

58:48.024 --> 58:49.548
Have you guys listened
to the Hard Harry show?

58:49.626 --> 58:52.652
We would never, ever
listen to trash like that.

58:52.762 --> 58:53.854
He's obscene, dude.

58:53.930 --> 58:55.295
Yo, Mom.

58:55.932 --> 58:58.423
Yo, I'm D-D-David Deaver

59:13.650 --> 59:15.515
Is that box
registered to a name?

59:15.752 --> 59:17.310
Yes, of course that box
is registered to a name...

59:17.453 --> 59:19.045
but I can't give it out to you.

59:19.255 --> 59:20.552
But you can to me.

59:20.657 --> 59:24.889
Yes, sir, I can do it for you.
I will give it to you instantly.

59:25.094 --> 59:28.086
That box is rented
to Mr. Charles U. Farley...

59:28.164 --> 59:29.290
One-one-two-two Crescent.

59:29.499 --> 59:31.160
But that's the address
of the school.

59:32.368 --> 59:34.336
Chuck U. Farley.

59:34.771 --> 59:37.001
ln a follow up
to Monday's tragic suicide...

59:37.173 --> 59:39.232
we have a story
on Paige Woodward...

59:39.375 --> 59:41.400
who was a senior
at the same high school...

59:41.477 --> 59:43.411
who, apparently at
the urging of the pirate DJ...

59:43.546 --> 59:46.037
set off an explosion
in her family's home.

59:46.249 --> 59:48.410
Are you OK, Mark?

59:48.585 --> 59:50.917
Don't worry. I'm not gonna
blow up the kitchen.

59:51.054 --> 59:52.316
Very funny, darling.

59:52.422 --> 59:53.548
Listen to this.

59:53.690 --> 59:55.681
...still anonymous
radio operator.

59:55.792 --> 59:57.726
He's been charged with
criminal solicitation...

59:57.860 --> 01:00:00.021
in the suicide death
of Malcolm Kaiser.

01:00:00.229 --> 01:00:01.389
Elsewhere--

01:00:02.365 --> 01:00:05.334
Mark, have you ever listened
to this character?

01:00:05.468 --> 01:00:07.402
No, not exactly listened.

01:00:07.503 --> 01:00:09.403
He's knocking the best school
in the district...

01:00:09.606 --> 01:00:10.800
and apparently, he goes there.

01:00:12.208 --> 01:00:14.676
Well, it's not exactly
the best school in the district.

01:00:14.777 --> 01:00:16.642
There are some problems with it.

01:00:16.813 --> 01:00:18.747
I figure
you don't rock the boat...

01:00:18.881 --> 01:00:20.610
especially if
you're sitting in it.

01:00:20.717 --> 01:00:22.309
We should get going.
I don't want to be late.

01:00:26.990 --> 01:00:29.652
Come on, Mark.
It's your father's big meeting.

01:00:30.126 --> 01:00:31.115
Good evening.

01:00:31.561 --> 01:00:33.256
On behalf of myself...

01:00:33.363 --> 01:00:35.797
and the staff
of Hubert Humphrey High...

01:00:36.099 --> 01:00:39.091
I would like to thank you
for turning out in such numbers.

01:00:39.435 --> 01:00:41.801
I congratulate you
on your concerns.

01:00:42.038 --> 01:00:44.165
Now, before we begin...

01:00:44.273 --> 01:00:48.437
I would like to introduce
our new school commissioner...

01:00:48.544 --> 01:00:51.342
fresh from several
educational triumphs...

01:00:51.547 --> 01:00:54.107
on the East Coast--
Brian Hunter.

01:00:58.821 --> 01:01:00.948
Before I introduce
the rest of our speakers--

01:01:01.324 --> 01:01:02.848
Excuse me, Mrs. Creswood.

01:01:02.959 --> 01:01:04.893
Can we just skip
the preliminaries...

01:01:04.961 --> 01:01:06.656
and find out what you're
doing about all this?

01:01:07.397 --> 01:01:09.524
Well,
when I introduce Mr. Deaver...

01:01:09.699 --> 01:01:12.600
he'll talk about
our new 24-hour hotline--

01:01:12.835 --> 01:01:15.303
Wait a minute. The kids
who need the most help...

01:01:15.405 --> 01:01:16.838
the ones with drug problems...

01:01:17.106 --> 01:01:18.698
they don't go in
for stuff like that.

01:01:18.908 --> 01:01:21.342
I know kids.
They just want to be happy.

01:01:21.577 --> 01:01:23.044
Would you please sit down?

01:01:23.246 --> 01:01:25.908
This radio person
is the whole problem.

01:01:26.149 --> 01:01:27.582
Are we gonna allow this guy
to be heard...

01:01:27.717 --> 01:01:29.241
by anyone who can turn a dial?

01:01:29.385 --> 01:01:30.613
Please, one at a time.

01:01:30.787 --> 01:01:32.687
I work with teenage gangs
in the city.

01:01:32.789 --> 01:01:34.620
I say we go after this guy.

01:01:34.791 --> 01:01:35.951
Remove him physically.

01:01:36.059 --> 01:01:37.185
Same old rhetoric!
What are you doing--

01:01:37.326 --> 01:01:40.625
Please! We can't have
this kind of meeting.

01:01:40.763 --> 01:01:42.230
This is not the way--

01:01:42.298 --> 01:01:43.560
You'll all be heard.
I promise.

01:01:43.700 --> 01:01:46.601
Brian, this is my meeting.

01:01:47.203 --> 01:01:49.763
That's the girl who blew up
her kitchen last night.

01:01:52.141 --> 01:01:53.403
My name is Paige Woodward...

01:01:53.543 --> 01:01:55.534
and I have something
to say to you people.

01:01:55.878 --> 01:01:58.779
People are saying Harry
is introducing bad things...

01:01:58.915 --> 01:02:00.348
and encouraging bad things.

01:02:00.450 --> 01:02:03.078
lt seems to me these things
were already here.

01:02:03.152 --> 01:02:04.483
Please go and sit.

01:02:04.654 --> 01:02:06.315
My God,
why don't you people listen?

01:02:06.489 --> 01:02:08.354
He's trying to tell you
there's something wrong...

01:02:08.491 --> 01:02:09.753
with this school.

01:02:09.859 --> 01:02:10.951
Paige--

01:02:11.060 --> 01:02:13.858
Half the people here
are on probation of some kind.

01:02:13.996 --> 01:02:17.397
We're all really scared
to be who we really are.

01:02:17.533 --> 01:02:18.966
I am not perfect.

01:02:19.202 --> 01:02:22.228
l've just been going through
the motions of being perfect...

01:02:22.338 --> 01:02:24.272
and inside, I am screaming!

01:02:24.474 --> 01:02:27.068
Paige, you were a model student.

01:02:28.044 --> 01:02:29.807
Why won't you listen?

01:02:31.347 --> 01:02:33.508
Let's hear what she has to say!

01:02:33.683 --> 01:02:35.017
Paige, I want to hear
what you have to say.

01:02:35.017 --> 01:02:36.143
Do you know who he is?

01:02:36.252 --> 01:02:37.514
Are you prepared to do
anything he says?

01:02:37.620 --> 01:02:39.952
Can you hear me?
Don't listen to them !

01:02:40.089 --> 01:02:42.649
Don't listen to any of them !
Stay on!

01:02:43.092 --> 01:02:44.889
Has this affected
your school work?

01:02:45.027 --> 01:02:47.086
Stand hard!

01:02:47.230 --> 01:02:49.061
What do your parents
think about this?

01:02:50.767 --> 01:02:52.359
Are you on drugs?

01:02:52.502 --> 01:02:54.470
Talk hard!

01:02:59.976 --> 01:03:02.444
I got a lot of homework.
I'm gonna take off, all right?

01:03:02.912 --> 01:03:05.972
I know why you're
really going home.

01:03:06.816 --> 01:03:09.842
'Cause you want to listen
to that show tonight, don't you?

01:03:47.723 --> 01:03:48.883
Let's go.

01:04:27.797 --> 01:04:29.162
What are you doing?

01:04:31.801 --> 01:04:33.428
Those your letters?

01:04:37.173 --> 01:04:39.232
You having fun?

01:04:51.053 --> 01:04:52.987
Here. I took some of these
off the wall for you.

01:04:53.122 --> 01:04:55.613
I mistakenly thought
you might want them.

01:04:56.959 --> 01:04:58.221
Thanks.

01:04:59.929 --> 01:05:03.365
So I guess you're not
going on tonight.

01:05:03.532 --> 01:05:04.931
Brilliant.

01:05:07.837 --> 01:05:10.499
Is this all just a game to you?

01:05:10.873 --> 01:05:13.842
You can't just shout "fire"
in a theater and walk out.

01:05:14.010 --> 01:05:17.275
You have a responsibility to
the people who believe in you.

01:05:17.446 --> 01:05:19.141
What is this?

01:05:19.348 --> 01:05:20.872
Come on, say something.

01:05:20.983 --> 01:05:22.644
Say anything!

01:05:23.586 --> 01:05:25.019
Open your mouth and say...

01:05:25.121 --> 01:05:26.918
"Get the hell out of here,
bitch."

01:05:27.189 --> 01:05:28.451
I can't.

01:05:28.624 --> 01:05:30.387
You can't what?

01:05:30.793 --> 01:05:33.318
I can't talk.

01:05:33.462 --> 01:05:35.396
Sure you can talk.

01:05:35.731 --> 01:05:37.665
I can't talk to you!

01:05:47.944 --> 01:05:51.710
I got a letter from
this guy who has a problem.

01:05:52.148 --> 01:05:54.378
He can't talk.

01:05:54.483 --> 01:05:57.816
I mean, he can talk,
but never when he wants to--

01:05:57.920 --> 01:06:00.184
not to girls, not to people.

01:06:00.790 --> 01:06:03.816
What did they say, around FM 92?

01:06:06.662 --> 01:06:08.789
I can't believe
it's as bad as they say.

01:06:09.031 --> 01:06:12.023
He just opened up his mouth,
and nothing came out.

01:06:12.168 --> 01:06:17.333
Then this jerk finds somebody
that he likes...

01:06:17.540 --> 01:06:19.633
which is probably the worst
thing that can happen...

01:06:19.875 --> 01:06:22.469
to a person that can't talk.

01:06:23.746 --> 01:06:26.306
I don't know
what to tell this guy...

01:06:26.449 --> 01:06:29.247
because lately,
every time I give advice...

01:06:29.318 --> 01:06:32.082
the fit hits the shan.

01:06:32.822 --> 01:06:34.050
So...

01:06:34.223 --> 01:06:37.249
I don't know. Maybe the...

01:06:37.560 --> 01:06:40.688
best thing to do is just...

01:06:41.163 --> 01:06:44.132
turn around...

01:06:44.166 --> 01:06:47.226
face the music...

01:06:47.370 --> 01:06:49.338
and try to talk.

01:06:54.844 --> 01:06:56.277
Fuck.

01:06:58.681 --> 01:06:59.807
Damn it. Coming!

01:06:59.915 --> 01:07:02.611
It's just us.
We want to come in for a minute.

01:07:03.319 --> 01:07:06.447
Just give me a second here!

01:07:08.257 --> 01:07:09.747
Two seconds!

01:07:10.826 --> 01:07:13.454
Mark, unlock the door.

01:07:14.096 --> 01:07:17.190
Mark, can you hear us?

01:07:17.400 --> 01:07:19.163
We want to come in for a minute.

01:07:19.235 --> 01:07:20.702
Open the goddamn door!

01:07:21.037 --> 01:07:22.504
On my way!

01:07:26.509 --> 01:07:28.409
Your mother and I have been
out there for five minutes.

01:07:28.544 --> 01:07:30.205
What the hell are you doing
in here?

01:07:30.780 --> 01:07:33.271
I was just reading.

01:07:33.849 --> 01:07:35.749
Oh, come on, Mark.
We heard you.

01:07:35.851 --> 01:07:37.318
We heard you talking, all right?

01:07:37.586 --> 01:07:39.383
Yeah. I was reading aloud.

01:07:39.555 --> 01:07:42.615
Oh, come on. You really
expect us to believe that?

01:07:42.858 --> 01:07:44.985
OK, I'll tell you the truth.

01:07:45.261 --> 01:07:47.422
He was talking to me.

01:07:49.098 --> 01:07:52.363
Hi. I'm Nora Diniro.

01:07:52.468 --> 01:07:53.901
Nice to meet you.

01:07:54.103 --> 01:07:55.297
How do you do?

01:07:55.438 --> 01:07:58.839
I was afraid you'd be mad
I interrupted Mark's homework.

01:07:59.241 --> 01:08:01.004
Oh, no. Not at all.

01:08:01.177 --> 01:08:03.145
You don't know how happy
we are to meet you.

01:08:03.245 --> 01:08:04.337
Yeah. Really.

01:08:04.947 --> 01:08:06.642
Well, listen, I gotta go...

01:08:06.682 --> 01:08:09.378
but it was really nice
to have met you.

01:08:10.519 --> 01:08:11.611
Bye, Mark.

01:08:11.821 --> 01:08:13.721
You don't have to go.
It's all right.

01:08:13.789 --> 01:08:14.915
Mark, she doesn't have to go.

01:08:15.191 --> 01:08:17.022
I'll see you tomorrow.

01:08:17.593 --> 01:08:20.288
You've been a bad dog,
haven't you?

01:08:20.429 --> 01:08:21.987
You know, for a second there...

01:08:22.098 --> 01:08:26.125
we actually thought you were
that crazy DJ character.

01:08:27.036 --> 01:08:30.198
Maybe he's not that crazy, Dad.

01:08:30.473 --> 01:08:31.962
Right. Very funny.

01:08:32.140 --> 01:08:34.803
Go get her. Come on.

01:08:36.845 --> 01:08:39.314
That's my idea of homework.

01:08:48.124 --> 01:08:50.888
Sorry about that, folks.
Technical difficulties.

01:08:51.827 --> 01:08:55.285
Happens all the time
in professional radio.

01:08:55.497 --> 01:08:59.434
Who do we have out there
tonight?

01:08:59.902 --> 01:09:03.997
The usual band of
teenage malcontents?

01:09:04.140 --> 01:09:05.573
I certainly hope so...

01:09:06.075 --> 01:09:08.908
'cause Hard Harry's feeling
kind of rude tonight.

01:09:13.649 --> 01:09:16.082
And she's so pretty, too.

01:09:16.285 --> 01:09:17.843
She sure is.

01:09:17.987 --> 01:09:19.648
That little lech.

01:09:20.322 --> 01:09:22.790
Well, like father, like son.

01:09:23.425 --> 01:09:24.517
I feel good!

01:09:24.827 --> 01:09:25.850
Damn!

01:09:27.296 --> 01:09:29.627
Well, well, the big news.

01:09:29.832 --> 01:09:33.131
Emergency PTA meeting
to discuss yours truly!

01:09:33.234 --> 01:09:35.669
Yes, all of the professionals
have come out...

01:09:35.804 --> 01:09:37.237
to talk about little old me...

01:09:37.372 --> 01:09:39.341
and now they've all
run home to tune in...

01:09:39.441 --> 01:09:41.466
and listen to what they've
all been talking about.

01:09:41.577 --> 01:09:44.410
They say I am deluded...

01:09:44.580 --> 01:09:47.310
demented...deranged!

01:09:47.416 --> 01:09:49.077
Well, guess what I say!

01:09:49.285 --> 01:09:51.276
So be it!

01:09:51.420 --> 01:09:53.649
Rise up in the cafeteria...

01:09:53.788 --> 01:09:56.383
and stab them
with your plastic forks!

01:09:56.492 --> 01:09:59.325
I say flogging and flagellation
for Miss Creswood!

01:09:59.461 --> 01:10:02.225
She gets a hundred lashes
for every single kid...

01:10:02.331 --> 01:10:04.663
that she has hounded
out of that fucking place!

01:10:04.867 --> 01:10:08.030
I say down with
all guidance counselors!

01:10:08.170 --> 01:10:09.569
Make them work for a living!

01:10:09.805 --> 01:10:11.329
I can't stay away from this man!

01:10:11.440 --> 01:10:13.874
I gotta give him another call!

01:10:14.009 --> 01:10:15.442
Here I come, Deav.

01:10:17.680 --> 01:10:19.341
Hotline.
Believe it or not, we care.

01:10:19.848 --> 01:10:22.180
Hi, Believe lt or Not,
this is Hard Harry...

01:10:22.284 --> 01:10:25.720
and I would like the pleasure
of speaking with Mr. Deaver.

01:10:25.955 --> 01:10:28.515
Just a moment.
I'll see if he's available.

01:10:28.724 --> 01:10:31.989
I love it.
They just put me on hold.

01:10:32.161 --> 01:10:35.358
I'm waiting for you.

01:10:35.464 --> 01:10:38.058
You can run,
but you cannot hide, Mr. Deaver.

01:10:38.200 --> 01:10:40.395
Waitin' for the Deav.

01:10:40.569 --> 01:10:42.764
Hello, my young friend.

01:10:43.272 --> 01:10:45.035
You're in on it,
right, Mr. Deaver?

01:10:45.174 --> 01:10:47.142
It's all over, son.

01:10:47.276 --> 01:10:49.471
This phone call
has been traced...

01:10:49.545 --> 01:10:53.504
and whoever you are,
you're history.

01:11:00.923 --> 01:11:02.049
Well...

01:11:05.961 --> 01:11:07.394
So be it.

01:11:07.529 --> 01:11:10.498
Hallelujah.

01:11:22.611 --> 01:11:26.513
Shit.
Don't just sit there, man. Run!

01:11:38.093 --> 01:11:40.459
Don't worry about me.

01:11:40.596 --> 01:11:42.029
I'm all right.

01:11:42.264 --> 01:11:44.494
See, I'll bet
what's happening out there...

01:11:44.700 --> 01:11:48.500
is that the police are busting
some poor little old couple...

01:11:48.570 --> 01:11:51.539
unknowingly supplying me
with my phone feed.

01:11:51.774 --> 01:11:54.208
There's a phone line
coming into the shed here.

01:11:59.682 --> 01:12:01.343
There's the transmitter...

01:12:01.483 --> 01:12:03.576
which means the receiver
could be in any house...

01:12:03.686 --> 01:12:05.278
within a thousand yards
of here.

01:12:05.521 --> 01:12:07.284
I am everywhere.

01:12:07.423 --> 01:12:11.553
I am inside each and every
single one of you.

01:12:11.860 --> 01:12:14.829
Just look in,
and I will be there...

01:12:15.164 --> 01:12:16.722
waving out at you...

01:12:17.666 --> 01:12:18.997
naked...

01:12:19.802 --> 01:12:21.599
wearing only a cock ring.

01:12:26.141 --> 01:12:28.666
Time flies
when you're on the run.

01:12:29.078 --> 01:12:31.638
I'm gonna cut out now
with this unusual song...

01:12:31.780 --> 01:12:34.271
I'm dedicating to...

01:12:34.416 --> 01:12:36.646
an unusual person...

01:12:36.952 --> 01:12:39.546
who makes me feel kind of...

01:12:39.788 --> 01:12:41.483
unusual.

01:12:58.574 --> 01:13:01.008
So many people

01:13:02.211 --> 01:13:03.906
Come walking by

01:13:05.547 --> 01:13:07.412
Looking so happy

01:13:07.683 --> 01:13:10.709
When all I do is cry

01:13:12.588 --> 01:13:15.421
I just wanna be

01:13:15.557 --> 01:13:18.890
With somebody, too

01:13:19.328 --> 01:13:22.923
What l'd give for a kiss

01:13:23.132 --> 01:13:26.158
What am I gonna do

01:13:26.668 --> 01:13:31.833
Why can't I fall in love

01:13:34.877 --> 01:13:37.437
It's OK.
You don't have to talk.

01:13:39.214 --> 01:13:40.681
You don't have
to say anything...

01:13:40.816 --> 01:13:43.376
and you don't
have to do anything...

01:13:44.720 --> 01:13:46.517
unless you want to.

01:13:50.692 --> 01:13:53.627
You're so different.

01:13:59.501 --> 01:14:01.196
I meant...

01:14:01.336 --> 01:14:03.361
you're so fearless.

01:14:07.176 --> 01:14:09.804
I wish I could be like you.

01:14:09.945 --> 01:14:11.810
You are.

01:14:13.816 --> 01:14:15.306
I wish...

01:14:15.417 --> 01:14:18.147
I could say things to you.

01:14:18.320 --> 01:14:19.878
You do.

01:14:23.425 --> 01:14:25.359
Everything's so strange.

01:14:30.766 --> 01:14:32.927
Maybe we're just crazy.

01:14:34.102 --> 01:14:35.399
So be it.

01:14:35.571 --> 01:14:38.768
And change where I'm at

01:14:39.274 --> 01:14:41.742
But the same old questions

01:14:42.277 --> 01:14:45.212
Keep flowing back

01:14:46.982 --> 01:14:51.419
Why can't I fall in love

01:14:53.956 --> 01:14:57.892
I know she's out there waiting

01:14:58.060 --> 01:15:04.522
It's time to fall in love

01:15:04.666 --> 01:15:06.463
And I know

01:15:06.535 --> 01:15:08.730
Just how I feel

01:15:08.837 --> 01:15:12.000
Give it up or give it all

01:15:13.075 --> 01:15:14.633
Something tells me

01:15:14.776 --> 01:15:17.939
This can be real

01:15:20.983 --> 01:15:22.575
It's the cops.

01:15:22.718 --> 01:15:25.881
It's OK. I think they're just
dropping off my neighbor.

01:15:35.097 --> 01:15:36.291
So...

01:15:36.431 --> 01:15:39.264
are you really
wearing a cock ring?

01:15:39.635 --> 01:15:41.762
l've never even seen one.

01:15:43.205 --> 01:15:45.639
I read about 'em in a magazine.

01:15:45.807 --> 01:15:47.035
Maybe I don't believe you.

01:15:47.175 --> 01:15:49.075
What are you doing?
I have neighbors.

01:15:49.244 --> 01:15:50.575
Stop!

01:15:53.782 --> 01:15:57.274
So you can talk
when you want to.

01:15:58.587 --> 01:15:59.713
Yes, I can.

01:15:59.888 --> 01:16:03.619
I know she's out there waiting

01:16:03.692 --> 01:16:07.059
It's time, it's time

01:16:07.296 --> 01:16:10.356
Why can't I fall in love

01:16:11.133 --> 01:16:15.797
Maybe we should pause
for station identification.

01:16:17.973 --> 01:16:19.304
I gotta go.

01:16:21.977 --> 01:16:27.472
Why can't I fall in love again

01:16:27.683 --> 01:16:31.380
I know she's out there waiting

01:16:32.588 --> 01:16:35.489
It's three days since the death
of Malcolm Kaiser...

01:16:35.624 --> 01:16:38.149
and state and local officials
still have little idea...

01:16:38.260 --> 01:16:40.888
of the identity
of this so-called Hard Harry...

01:16:41.029 --> 01:16:45.557
although many are convinced
he is a student at this school.

01:17:08.223 --> 01:17:10.088
You OK?

01:17:15.464 --> 01:17:17.056
You?

01:18:34.409 --> 01:18:37.276
This is deep.
Your message is out there.

01:18:37.412 --> 01:18:38.845
"The truth is a virus."

01:18:38.947 --> 01:18:40.073
Oh, God.

01:18:42.350 --> 01:18:45.114
Jesus, this whole thing
is making me ill.

01:18:45.454 --> 01:18:46.853
Mark, what is with you?

01:18:47.389 --> 01:18:49.289
Look, Nora,
last night was a mistake.

01:18:49.391 --> 01:18:51.382
I'm not going on anymore.
It's over.

01:18:51.560 --> 01:18:53.619
-But you're so close.
-Close to what?

01:18:53.829 --> 01:18:55.524
To getting your message out.

01:18:55.731 --> 01:18:57.892
This is my life you're
screwing around with here.

01:18:58.100 --> 01:19:00.295
Not anymore, it isn't.
This is everyone's life.

01:19:00.469 --> 01:19:02.835
You can't leave it like this.
People are confused.

01:19:03.004 --> 01:19:04.164
Well, so am l.

01:19:04.406 --> 01:19:05.873
The thing's fucked up!
It's crazy!

01:19:06.174 --> 01:19:09.575
No. The world is fucked up,
just like you said.

01:19:09.711 --> 01:19:12.839
Don't you see
that you're the voice?

01:19:12.981 --> 01:19:14.881
You're the voice
you were waiting for.

01:19:15.016 --> 01:19:16.950
You're completely nuts.

01:19:19.387 --> 01:19:21.821
Yeah, well, you make me nuts.

01:19:28.196 --> 01:19:29.163
Excuse me.

01:19:29.364 --> 01:19:31.594
Young lady,
would you come along with us?

01:19:31.767 --> 01:19:34.736
Donald, come along.
Miss Diniro.

01:19:34.870 --> 01:19:36.497
Come along with us, please.

01:19:36.638 --> 01:19:38.003
What are we being busted for?

01:19:38.106 --> 01:19:40.301
We check your files, we'll see.

01:19:40.408 --> 01:19:41.773
Come along.

01:19:43.378 --> 01:19:45.710
No, Brian,
everything is under control.

01:19:45.847 --> 01:19:47.940
l've just ordered
psychiatric evaluations...

01:19:48.049 --> 01:19:51.917
on a couple of the key
troublemakers, and l--

01:19:52.087 --> 01:19:55.818
I can do whatever I like.
It's my school, Commissioner.

01:19:55.957 --> 01:19:57.151
No, you're not coming over here.

01:19:57.359 --> 01:19:59.725
lt would only upset me more.
Good-bye.

01:20:00.328 --> 01:20:01.454
Well...

01:20:01.596 --> 01:20:03.860
shall we have a look
at these files?

01:20:03.999 --> 01:20:07.366
Or shall we discuss
the identity of our DJ friend?

01:20:10.705 --> 01:20:13.037
No more Mr. Nice Guy!

01:20:13.208 --> 01:20:14.641
Oh, God!

01:20:14.776 --> 01:20:17.711
Kick out the jams,
motherfuckers!

01:20:20.849 --> 01:20:23.682
Don't push me, people.
You understand that?

01:20:28.690 --> 01:20:32.387
They got forced to take me back.

01:20:32.894 --> 01:20:34.122
Where you going?

01:20:34.262 --> 01:20:35.490
Yo, I'm putting this up.

01:20:35.597 --> 01:20:36.791
Get off the campus.

01:20:36.932 --> 01:20:38.058
Put it on my desk.

01:20:38.200 --> 01:20:39.827
You're not supposed to be here.

01:20:39.968 --> 01:20:41.731
What's the matter, Murdock?
You're getting so tense.

01:20:41.903 --> 01:20:43.803
You're not supposed to be here.

01:20:43.972 --> 01:20:45.837
I'm a big fan of yours.

01:20:45.941 --> 01:20:47.272
Can I get an autograph?

01:20:50.846 --> 01:20:52.711
Stop! That's enough!

01:20:52.814 --> 01:20:54.509
What's wrong with you?

01:20:54.616 --> 01:20:55.947
He was beating up students.

01:20:56.051 --> 01:20:57.916
-What's wrong with this school?
-Control yourself.

01:20:58.053 --> 01:20:59.748
I will not!
I want an answer!

01:20:59.821 --> 01:21:01.448
Or suffer the consequences.

01:21:01.623 --> 01:21:03.056
What are you talking about?

01:21:03.325 --> 01:21:06.123
I'm talking about
your dismissal.

01:21:28.283 --> 01:21:30.649
l've been looking
all over for you.

01:21:30.785 --> 01:21:34.243
I just wanted to apologize
for saying that you were nuts.

01:21:34.456 --> 01:21:35.582
Forget it.

01:21:35.957 --> 01:21:37.720
Look...

01:21:37.826 --> 01:21:40.090
FCC. You know what that means?

01:21:40.996 --> 01:21:44.227
Yeah, it means Federal
Communications Commission.

01:21:44.332 --> 01:21:47.392
They can drive around
and triangulate...

01:21:47.502 --> 01:21:50.096
wherever the hell the radio
signal's coming from.

01:21:50.572 --> 01:21:52.870
Yes, I know exactly
what it means.

01:21:53.008 --> 01:21:55.340
So fuck it, right?
I mean it's over.

01:21:55.477 --> 01:21:57.911
Frankly, I don't even
give a shit anymore.

01:21:58.446 --> 01:21:59.970
What the hell's wrong?

01:22:03.885 --> 01:22:06.183
I just got expelled.

01:22:07.489 --> 01:22:09.616
What the hell
are you talking about?

01:22:09.891 --> 01:22:12.155
I'm failing math.

01:22:13.962 --> 01:22:15.623
They can't kick you
out for that.

01:22:15.797 --> 01:22:17.788
l've been cutting classes,
and I'm way over the limit.

01:22:17.966 --> 01:22:19.365
They didn't tell me till now.

01:22:19.501 --> 01:22:21.492
So that just deserves
a suspension, right?

01:22:21.770 --> 01:22:24.671
Well, then I said "fuck you"
to Creswood.

01:22:25.073 --> 01:22:26.938
You should have seen her face.

01:22:27.108 --> 01:22:29.076
She was so happy,
she said thank you.

01:22:29.778 --> 01:22:31.405
This school sucks!

01:22:31.980 --> 01:22:33.208
Jesus Christ.

01:22:33.315 --> 01:22:35.783
I don't even care--
No, just leave it alone!

01:22:35.917 --> 01:22:38.112
There's nothing
you can do about it.

01:22:40.722 --> 01:22:42.781
Hunter, wait a minute!

01:22:43.124 --> 01:22:47.220
I just wanted to say good-bye...

01:22:47.929 --> 01:22:49.453
and good luck.

01:22:49.698 --> 01:22:50.858
Why?

01:22:51.166 --> 01:22:53.634
I was fired. I made a mistake.

01:22:53.735 --> 01:22:55.532
I thought I could change things.

01:22:55.704 --> 01:22:57.729
I forgot
you don't rock the boat.

01:22:58.006 --> 01:23:00.031
Especially when you're in it.

01:23:00.842 --> 01:23:02.605
Come on, chin up.

01:23:11.553 --> 01:23:13.418
Loretta, what in the hell's
happening here?

01:23:13.621 --> 01:23:15.111
It's the troublemakers.

01:23:15.223 --> 01:23:18.351
You can't run a top school
with troublemakers in the mix.

01:23:18.560 --> 01:23:20.721
OK, so what exactly
is a troublemaker?

01:23:20.962 --> 01:23:23.954
Someone who has
no interest in education.

01:23:24.265 --> 01:23:26.961
Come on, that includes
every teenager I know.

01:23:27.202 --> 01:23:28.533
Can't you understand...

01:23:28.670 --> 01:23:31.332
that nothing is more important
than a good education?

01:23:31.573 --> 01:23:33.598
Except the basic right to it.

01:23:35.043 --> 01:23:36.442
The point is...

01:23:36.544 --> 01:23:40.776
I have the highest average
S.A.T. scores in the state.

01:23:41.182 --> 01:23:42.410
Yeah, but how?

01:23:42.550 --> 01:23:44.415
I stand by my record.

01:24:11.346 --> 01:24:12.506
There he is. Mr. Watts.

01:24:12.647 --> 01:24:15.047
Shep Sheppard,
Channel Six news here.

01:24:16.418 --> 01:24:17.544
Good evening.

01:24:19.287 --> 01:24:21.983
How does Washington intend
to deal with this situation?

01:24:22.123 --> 01:24:24.648
We at the FCC feel
that democracy is all about...

01:24:24.859 --> 01:24:27.657
protecting the rights
of the ordinary citizen.

01:24:27.862 --> 01:24:30.695
Unregulated radio
would result in programming...

01:24:30.832 --> 01:24:32.561
of the lowest
common denominator...

01:24:32.834 --> 01:24:34.825
the rule of the mob.

01:24:36.237 --> 01:24:38.603
This is vandalism,
not free expression.

01:25:13.274 --> 01:25:15.401
Hey, NBC's here,
and if he goes on...

01:25:15.543 --> 01:25:17.135
they're gonna rebroadcast him
nationally.

01:25:17.212 --> 01:25:19.237
There's no way he can go on.
It's too risky.

01:25:19.447 --> 01:25:21.312
Oh, God, come on.

01:26:12.667 --> 01:26:16.103
OK, everybody, ten seconds
till Happy Harry Hard-on.

01:26:17.338 --> 01:26:19.306
Eight, seven...

01:26:19.440 --> 01:26:21.670
six, five, four...

01:26:21.809 --> 01:26:23.936
three, two, one.

01:26:33.721 --> 01:26:36.519
Come on. We're right here
waiting for you right now.

01:26:58.313 --> 01:26:59.746
You OK?

01:27:00.448 --> 01:27:02.678
Yeah, fine, great.

01:27:02.817 --> 01:27:04.284
Never been better.

01:27:07.088 --> 01:27:09.022
We started something here.

01:27:09.123 --> 01:27:10.055
We?

01:27:10.325 --> 01:27:12.384
All right, I started it, but...

01:27:12.560 --> 01:27:15.961
now I need your help
to finish it.

01:27:18.800 --> 01:27:22.099
Nora, I need you.

01:27:24.172 --> 01:27:25.605
Well, it's about time.

01:27:26.774 --> 01:27:28.799
I've got something to show you.

01:27:29.811 --> 01:27:32.974
Is it bigger than a baby's arm?

01:27:34.048 --> 01:27:36.278
No. It's outside.

01:27:40.154 --> 01:27:41.678
It's my mom's Jeep.

01:27:41.856 --> 01:27:44.086
She kind of loaned it to me.

01:27:45.360 --> 01:27:47.351
Who did all this?

01:27:47.495 --> 01:27:49.929
Me and Radio Shack.

01:27:53.668 --> 01:27:56.068
You have driven
a Jeep before, right?

01:27:58.339 --> 01:28:03.470
Everybody knows

01:28:03.611 --> 01:28:07.274
Everybody knows

01:28:08.283 --> 01:28:11.480
That's the way the story goes

01:28:14.222 --> 01:28:15.746
Got him.

01:28:17.258 --> 01:28:20.352
You know, personally,
I had hoped that we'd get...

01:28:20.461 --> 01:28:23.123
to hear him a little bit
before they nab him.

01:28:23.298 --> 01:28:26.495
Be interesting to see
how hard he is then.

01:28:28.069 --> 01:28:30.196
Hi, Dad, happy birthday

01:28:30.338 --> 01:28:32.499
I'm in jail

01:28:32.640 --> 01:28:34.403
Jail

01:28:34.509 --> 01:28:36.204
Hello, Dad

01:28:36.311 --> 01:28:37.539
I'm in jail

01:28:37.645 --> 01:28:39.875
Hello, Dad

01:28:39.981 --> 01:28:41.881
I'm in jail

01:28:41.916 --> 01:28:43.008
Hi, Dad

01:28:43.251 --> 01:28:46.084
I'm calling you from jail

01:28:46.154 --> 01:28:47.246
Hi, Dad

01:28:47.388 --> 01:28:49.379
Happy birthday

01:28:49.524 --> 01:28:51.389
I'm in jail

01:28:51.492 --> 01:28:53.392
Jail, jail

01:28:53.528 --> 01:28:55.621
Hello, Dad.
We're going to jail.

01:28:55.830 --> 01:28:57.354
Say hi to Mom !

01:28:58.366 --> 01:28:59.560
I like it here

01:28:59.701 --> 01:29:01.498
It's nice, I like it

01:29:01.769 --> 01:29:04.704
Hi, folks. Seems we have
a new listener tonight--

01:29:04.839 --> 01:29:06.329
Mr. Watts of the FCC.

01:29:06.607 --> 01:29:08.871
My favorite person
and yours, too, I know.

01:29:09.110 --> 01:29:11.340
Hi, Arthur,
thanks for coming out.

01:29:11.512 --> 01:29:13.844
Well, thank you for coming out.

01:29:14.182 --> 01:29:15.911
Imagine,
a fucking political hack...

01:29:16.017 --> 01:29:18.952
being in charge
of free speech in America.

01:29:19.053 --> 01:29:20.987
I'll bet Watts was the guy
who took names in high school...

01:29:21.155 --> 01:29:22.747
when the teacher was absent.

01:29:22.990 --> 01:29:25.322
This is the problem
with free speech.

01:29:25.426 --> 01:29:26.757
Would you cut that thing,
please?

01:29:26.894 --> 01:29:29.692
He's the kind of phony
in politics who wears a wig.

01:29:29.831 --> 01:29:31.355
Would you just turn
the damn thing off?

01:29:31.466 --> 01:29:32.125
Christ.

01:29:46.914 --> 01:29:48.074
He's obviously moving.

01:29:48.216 --> 01:29:50.081
Just pull over
everything on wheels.

01:29:50.251 --> 01:29:52.651
Welcome to Radio Free America.

01:29:52.754 --> 01:29:54.381
America's ready, I'm ready.

01:29:54.489 --> 01:29:58.016
I want a million voices
crying out in the wilderness.

01:29:58.159 --> 01:30:00.059
Jesus, let's get serious.

01:30:10.471 --> 01:30:12.962
Hello. Hello, anyone.

01:30:13.040 --> 01:30:14.598
This is Arthur Watts.

01:30:14.742 --> 01:30:16.767
I am under siege.

01:30:17.178 --> 01:30:19.305
Maybe Mr. Watts
can shed some light...

01:30:19.414 --> 01:30:22.645
on the mysterious disappearances
of some of our students.

01:30:22.784 --> 01:30:25.446
Luis Chavez, age fifteen...

01:30:25.586 --> 01:30:27.679
legally kicked out
on September 26.

01:30:27.989 --> 01:30:31.823
Arthur Washington, age sixteen,
expelled on September 27.

01:30:32.059 --> 01:30:33.026
Hector Garcia...

01:30:33.261 --> 01:30:34.285
So what does this prove?

01:30:34.429 --> 01:30:36.021
Not everyone goes to college.

01:30:36.097 --> 01:30:37.189
Right.

01:30:37.765 --> 01:30:41.667
I think you should be
aware of something.

01:30:42.136 --> 01:30:44.764
After the school received
the money from the government...

01:30:44.939 --> 01:30:46.634
for every enrolled student...

01:30:46.741 --> 01:30:48.572
Mrs. Creswood
would then proceed...

01:30:48.676 --> 01:30:52.134
to weed out those
she felt were undesirable.

01:30:52.313 --> 01:30:54.781
Nonsense. She doesn't know
what she's talking about.

01:30:54.982 --> 01:30:56.279
ln the first week of school...

01:30:56.350 --> 01:30:59.911
you flagged all the names
with low S.A.T. scores...

01:31:00.021 --> 01:31:02.080
and started files on them. Why?

01:31:02.256 --> 01:31:03.951
What are you doing
with school property?

01:31:04.025 --> 01:31:05.185
She asked you why.

01:31:05.326 --> 01:31:06.588
For extra tutoring?

01:31:06.727 --> 01:31:08.126
You expelled
over twenty students...

01:31:08.262 --> 01:31:09.695
in the first thirty days
of school.

01:31:09.797 --> 01:31:11.822
And how many others did you
harass into dropping out?

01:31:11.933 --> 01:31:13.457
And you kept the expelled
students' names on the rolls.

01:31:13.568 --> 01:31:14.660
That's illegal.

01:31:14.769 --> 01:31:16.202
The money went to the school.

01:31:16.404 --> 01:31:17.735
It's all for the good
of the school.

01:31:17.872 --> 01:31:19.100
Those kids had rights.

01:31:19.240 --> 01:31:20.673
They were losers.

01:31:20.808 --> 01:31:22.537
-Troublemakers.
-They're just kids.

01:31:22.643 --> 01:31:24.508
I don't regret my policy.

01:31:24.645 --> 01:31:27.079
It's criminal,
and I'm suspending you.

01:31:27.181 --> 01:31:29.012
You can't do that.

01:31:29.183 --> 01:31:30.980
I think I just did.

01:31:53.608 --> 01:31:55.269
Please get some help.

01:32:03.751 --> 01:32:05.150
Just drive over them.

01:32:23.104 --> 01:32:24.366
Oh, jeez, my harmonizer.

01:32:24.605 --> 01:32:25.401
Forget it.

01:32:25.606 --> 01:32:27.369
Hold on.
I gotta get us out of here.

01:32:35.283 --> 01:32:37.478
I needed that
to disguise my voice.

01:32:37.618 --> 01:32:39.347
Give me a minute.
Maybe we can fix it.

01:32:44.625 --> 01:32:45.819
Jesus.

01:32:46.561 --> 01:32:48.392
Look at this.

01:32:51.065 --> 01:32:52.794
Fuck it.
I'm going on without that thing.

01:32:52.967 --> 01:32:54.559
No. I think I've got it.

01:32:57.672 --> 01:32:59.230
OK.

01:33:00.141 --> 01:33:01.665
This is really me now.

01:33:01.842 --> 01:33:03.469
No more hiding.

01:33:05.980 --> 01:33:07.811
Listen.

01:33:07.915 --> 01:33:09.906
We're all worried.

01:33:09.984 --> 01:33:11.508
We're all in pain.

01:33:11.919 --> 01:33:14.979
That just comes with
having eyes, with having ears.

01:33:15.189 --> 01:33:17.453
But just remember one thing.

01:33:17.558 --> 01:33:20.721
lt can't get any worse.
lt can only get better.

01:33:21.228 --> 01:33:22.923
I mean,
high school is the bottom.

01:33:23.230 --> 01:33:25.790
Being a teenager sucks,
but that's the point.

01:33:25.933 --> 01:33:27.764
Surviving it is the whole point.

01:33:28.269 --> 01:33:30.794
Quitting is not
going to make you strong.

01:33:30.938 --> 01:33:35.898
Living will, so just hang on
and hang in there.

01:33:37.545 --> 01:33:41.003
I know all about
the hating and the sneering.

01:33:41.115 --> 01:33:44.380
I'm a member of the
"Why bother?" generation myself.

01:33:44.552 --> 01:33:47.953
But why did I bother
to come out here tonight?

01:33:48.122 --> 01:33:49.521
And why did you?

01:33:50.324 --> 01:33:52.315
I mean, it's time.

01:33:52.493 --> 01:33:55.929
lt begins with us--
not with politicians...

01:33:56.063 --> 01:33:59.464
the experts, or the teachers,
but with us--

01:33:59.634 --> 01:34:01.864
with you and with me--

01:34:02.136 --> 01:34:04.604
the ones who need it most.

01:34:04.772 --> 01:34:08.640
I believe with everything
that's in me...

01:34:08.809 --> 01:34:12.074
that the whole world
is longing for a healing.

01:34:12.279 --> 01:34:15.737
Even the trees...

01:34:16.050 --> 01:34:18.814
and the Earth itself
are crying out for it.

01:34:19.086 --> 01:34:21.577
You can hear it everywhere.

01:34:21.789 --> 01:34:26.522
It's the same kind of healing
I desperately needed, and...

01:34:28.195 --> 01:34:30.095
finally feel has begun...

01:34:31.032 --> 01:34:32.124
with you.

01:35:25.286 --> 01:35:27.413
Everyone listen up!

01:35:27.555 --> 01:35:30.183
It's not over yet.
This is just the beginning...

01:35:30.391 --> 01:35:32.018
but it's up to you.

01:35:32.126 --> 01:35:34.594
I'm calling for every kid
to seize the air.

01:35:34.795 --> 01:35:37.195
Steal it. lt belongs to you.

01:35:37.398 --> 01:35:38.422
Speak out.

01:35:38.566 --> 01:35:39.999
They can't stop you.

01:35:40.134 --> 01:35:41.795
Find your voice and use it.

01:35:42.002 --> 01:35:44.197
Keep this thing going.
Pick a name.

01:35:44.505 --> 01:35:46.029
Go on the air.

01:35:46.173 --> 01:35:48.664
It's your life.
Take charge of it. Do it.

01:35:48.776 --> 01:35:51.438
Try it, try anything.

01:35:51.612 --> 01:35:52.840
Spill your guts out.

01:35:52.980 --> 01:35:54.675
Say shit and fuck
a million times...

01:35:54.749 --> 01:35:57.047
if you want to, but you decide.

01:35:57.184 --> 01:35:58.583
Fill the air.

01:35:58.719 --> 01:36:00.016
Steal it.

01:36:00.154 --> 01:36:01.553
Keep the air alive!

01:36:15.236 --> 01:36:17.397
We're behind you all the way,
Harry.

01:36:18.806 --> 01:36:21.775
You talked to me, man.
You really talked to me.

01:36:21.876 --> 01:36:24.208
You're the one, man.

01:36:24.445 --> 01:36:26.140
We believe in you, Harry.

01:36:26.280 --> 01:36:27.907
Stay tough, man.

01:36:28.149 --> 01:36:29.582
You did great.

01:36:29.683 --> 01:36:32.652
Forget it, man.
We believe in you, Harry.

01:36:34.288 --> 01:36:37.519
We're with you, man.
We're with you all the way.

01:36:38.425 --> 01:36:40.290
Talk hard!

01:36:50.905 --> 01:36:54.864
Hi, everybody, this is Amy
at 97 FM in Springfield...

01:36:54.975 --> 01:36:56.636
and my show is Radioactive.

01:36:56.777 --> 01:36:57.869
Can anyone out there hear me?

01:36:58.045 --> 01:37:00.707
This is Ethan from L.A.,
and I'm here...

01:37:00.981 --> 01:37:02.949
Are you running in the streets?

01:37:03.150 --> 01:37:04.378
Call the real runaway hotline...

01:37:04.652 --> 01:37:07.120
K.C.A.T.,
Los Gatos, California...

01:37:07.288 --> 01:37:10.257
This is "I am, are you?"

01:37:10.391 --> 01:37:12.086
Hi, you're on the air...

01:37:12.226 --> 01:37:13.318
Turn on the truth.

01:37:14.305 --> 01:37:20.251
