not by skin temperature, no way.

In fact, there's no guarantee
that even you--

you'd have a four to one glide ratio.

01:04:56.492 --> 01:04:58.119
Shh. Come here.

01:05:02.231 --> 01:05:03.665
Where's Al Hagmud?

01:05:03.733 --> 01:05:05.098
<i>Who are you'?
What are you ddmg here'?</i>

01:05:05.167 --> 01:05:06.896
Never mind. I'm here to get him out.

01:05:08.771 --> 01:05:11.103
Then your intelligence
is a bit dated.

RUDY: You lied.

01:05:29.659 --> 01:05:30.785
How did you find out?

01:05:30.860 --> 01:05:33.830
What's the difference
how I found out? I know.

01:05:33.896 --> 01:05:37.799
And what I don't know is how you could
possibly send a man to his death...

01:05:39.869 --> 01:05:40.893

01:05:40.970 --> 01:05:43.496
None that could justify
what you've done. None!

01:05:43.572 --> 01:05:46.564
Dr. VVells, listen to me carefully.

01:05:46.642 --> 01:05:49.134
You're very good at what you do.

01:05:49.211 --> 01:05:53.079
But you have no idea at all
about what I do.

01:05:53.149 --> 01:05:55.481
Steve Austin is a risk.
He was from the very beginning.

01:05:55.551 --> 01:05:57.110
Why don't you just let him die?

01:05:57.186 --> 01:05:59.086
Because he's all I had.

01:05:59.155 --> 01:06:03.649
So we spent millions on him.
Literally rebuilt him from scrap.

01:06:03.726 --> 01:06:06.127
But with all your technology...

01:06:06.195 --> 01:06:09.290
what I couldn't rebuild
into him was attitude.

01:06:09.365 --> 01:06:12.164
Oh, yes. VUe trained him,
we taught him, we tested him...

01:06:12.234 --> 01:06:16.728
but how do you test a man to find out
if he has the need-- the will to survive?

01:06:16.806 --> 01:06:21.141
Are you telling me for the sake of a test
you risked an extraordinary man's life?

01:06:21.210 --> 01:06:22.871
Telling ma'?
Walk.

01:06:22.945 --> 01:06:26.074
Don't be sentimental. I can always have
another cyborg built if this one fails.

01:06:26.148 --> 01:06:30.346
But if he should survive,
which appears to be doubtful...

01:06:30.419 --> 01:06:32.217
then I know that I have my man.

01:06:32.288 --> 01:06:35.588
On the contrary. If he survives,
you've lost your man.

01:06:35.658 --> 01:06:40.220
Doesn't your file tell you they'll hold you
in contempt for what you've done?

01:06:40.296 --> 01:06:44.597
I am not concerned about feelings--
his, yours or mine.

01:06:44.667 --> 01:06:46.965
Before I risk VVorld VVar Ill on a man...

01:06:47.036 --> 01:06:50.768
I must know, beyond a doubt,
that he is utterly, totally reliable.

01:06:53.709 --> 01:06:56.508
There was no other way.

01:06:57.780 --> 01:07:01.683
BOY. you guys really
play for keeps, don't you?

01:07:01.751 --> 01:07:05.187
Yes, Dr. Wells.
Of course we play for keeps.

They will question you.

01:07:31.914 --> 01:07:34.246
And if they determine
you have no use to them...

01:07:34.316 --> 01:07:36.307
they will shoot you.

Here. Take a card.

01:07:51.267 --> 01:07:53.861
Too bad. It's a great trick.

01:07:53.936 --> 01:07:55.631

I wanted to make it back.

Is it possible to keep him

Now what are you going to do?

Keep him under
