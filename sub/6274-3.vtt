<i>Previously on Masters Of Sex...</i>

00:07.695 --> 00:08.693
They've invited us to dinner.

00:08.731 --> 00:10.432
They're very nice, the Edleys.

00:10.466 --> 00:13.201
He's a big guy,
a former football player.

00:13.236 --> 00:14.769
What do you want from me?

00:14.804 --> 00:16.905
I just want you to be
aware of all the things

00:16.940 --> 00:18.941
you've ruined for me
because you don't remember.

00:18.975 --> 00:20.375
You know what, mom?

00:20.410 --> 00:21.944
You're the last person who gets
to lecture me on anything.

00:21.978 --> 00:24.078
A pregnant, unwed woman

00:24.112 --> 00:26.180
cannot be the standard bearer
for the cause of--

00:26.214 --> 00:27.982
Cause of sexual enlightenment,

00:28.016 --> 00:29.116
yes, Bill, I realize that.

00:29.151 --> 00:30.585
You have made that very clear.

00:30.619 --> 00:33.521
This is not a traditional
marriage she's proposing.

00:33.556 --> 00:37.024
Simply an arrangement
to give your child legitimacy.

00:37.059 --> 00:39.093
It's about legitimizing
your partnership, too.

00:39.127 --> 00:41.862
Perhaps it's your
ambivalence that's the problem.

00:41.896 --> 00:44.165
That you live in a constant
state of apology

00:44.199 --> 00:45.266
to your children.

00:45.300 --> 00:47.068
What-- what
if you showed this baby

00:47.102 --> 00:49.470
that you were choosing
to pursue your passion,

00:49.504 --> 00:51.638
not over him, but for him?

00:51.673 --> 00:53.874
You parented this book,
Virginia--

00:53.908 --> 00:56.310
Half you, half me,
and now here it is.

"Dr. Masters
and Mrs. Johnson herald

01:46.026 --> 01:48.760
what is truly
a Copernican revolution

01:48.794 --> 01:51.430
in the study
of human sexuality."

01:51.464 --> 01:52.764
"The American Medical Journal."

01:52.798 --> 01:54.366
And that's after the grilling

01:54.400 --> 01:55.934
Buckland put us through
in Boston.

01:55.968 --> 01:57.169
Copernicus?

01:57.203 --> 02:00.506
Why doesn't he just compare us
to Jesus himself?

02:00.540 --> 02:02.841
"The Journal
For American Gynecology" says

02:02.875 --> 02:04.308
our book is highly recommended,

02:04.343 --> 02:06.011
as does
"American Endocrinology,"

02:06.045 --> 02:07.378
"The Easton Review."

02:07.412 --> 02:10.580
Buckland uses the word
"brilliant" three times.

02:10.616 --> 02:11.716
Did you see that?

02:11.751 --> 02:13.551
- Four times.
- Four times.

02:13.585 --> 02:16.487
And then goes on, "Well,
I will not hazard an answer

02:16.522 --> 02:19.490
to the question posed
on the cover of 'Time Magazine, '

02:19.525 --> 02:22.226
after reading
'Human Sexual Response, '

02:22.261 --> 02:25.463
I can confidently say
even if God is not dead,

02:25.497 --> 02:28.132
Dr. Freud certainly is."

02:31.670 --> 02:33.037
But we killed Freud.

02:33.071 --> 02:34.838
But we knew that years ago.

02:45.784 --> 02:47.718
You haven't...

02:47.752 --> 02:50.921
tried to touch me
in almost a year.

02:50.955 --> 02:52.489
Well, no,
eight months, Virginia,

02:52.523 --> 02:53.890
and I wanted to--
You know that.

02:53.924 --> 02:55.992
I didn't care
that it was George's baby.

02:56.026 --> 02:57.661
I cared.

02:57.695 --> 03:02.232
But... now the baby is here.

03:02.266 --> 03:07.136
And all traces of George
have gone.

03:07.171 --> 03:08.971
Yeah.

03:18.949 --> 03:20.516
That was easy.

03:28.625 --> 03:30.892
No, I want to see you.

03:30.927 --> 03:34.763
You can see me well enough.

03:34.797 --> 03:37.600
Eight months
is a long time, Virginia.

03:37.634 --> 03:39.034
I know.

03:39.068 --> 03:43.238
Have you...
Have you missed this?

03:43.272 --> 03:45.673
Of course I have.

03:52.181 --> 03:56.251
It's just...

03:56.285 --> 04:00.187
Your body...

04:00.222 --> 04:01.422
It...

04:01.457 --> 04:05.826
It never quite feels exactly
like itself...

04:05.861 --> 04:09.130
afterwards.
I mean, eventually, it does.

04:09.164 --> 04:11.098
Usually after six weeks.

04:11.133 --> 04:13.934
Often, you can resume sex
after six weeks,

04:13.969 --> 04:15.335
you're now at eight.

04:15.370 --> 04:18.172
And your body is...

04:18.206 --> 04:19.606
Not like itself.

04:19.641 --> 04:20.641
...perfect.

04:49.837 --> 04:52.172
She usually falls back asleep.

05:11.725 --> 05:13.559
Do you remember that?

05:13.593 --> 05:17.596
I know!
I would like to do that!

05:17.631 --> 05:18.764
Oh, Bill!

05:18.799 --> 05:21.166
How is that project of yours
coming along?

05:21.201 --> 05:22.201
Study, right?

05:22.235 --> 05:24.002
A study that's now a book.

05:25.638 --> 05:27.105
I wrote a book.

05:27.140 --> 05:28.440
My nephew wrote a book.

05:28.474 --> 05:30.909
He said it all
just sort of came to him.

05:30.944 --> 05:33.011
Is that how it was for you,
Bill?

05:33.046 --> 05:34.346
No.
Can you excuse me?

05:34.380 --> 05:35.413
Oh.

05:41.153 --> 05:42.387
I already did it.

05:42.421 --> 05:44.055
What?

05:44.089 --> 05:45.824
I have to get home.

05:45.858 --> 05:47.659
I'm sure he's going crazy.

05:47.693 --> 05:51.128
In fact, he showed me
three apartments just today.

05:51.163 --> 05:53.898
Joy, that is a really big step.

05:53.932 --> 05:56.834
Two of them are
the size of postage stamps.

05:56.869 --> 06:00.104
I told him that I'd make
a decision by week's end.

06:00.138 --> 06:04.342
We talked about this, Libby--
Our dissatisfaction.

06:04.376 --> 06:06.110
Yes, it was just talk, Joy.

06:06.144 --> 06:08.445
But if I don't do something
about this now, then I'm just...

06:08.480 --> 06:11.248
That's all it will ever be,
just talk.

06:12.884 --> 06:15.285
Bill.

06:15.319 --> 06:17.187
I should probably be going.

06:17.221 --> 06:19.456
Bill can walk you home,
if you like.

06:19.491 --> 06:22.025
I'm right next door.
Don't be silly.

06:22.059 --> 06:23.960
Congratulations on the book,
Bill.

06:23.995 --> 06:26.797
I'm gonna pick up a copy
tomorrow in broad daylight

06:26.831 --> 06:29.299
were even babies
and churchgoers can see me.

06:29.333 --> 06:31.101
Call you tomorrow, Libby.

06:33.104 --> 06:35.238
I thought
the Grape Boycott Committee

06:35.273 --> 06:36.373
met on Thursdays.

06:36.407 --> 06:39.242
It does.
Tonight was book group.

06:39.277 --> 06:40.676
Ah.

06:46.349 --> 06:50.019
I just found out that Joy
is talking about leaving Paul.

06:50.053 --> 06:53.289
And not just talking,
actually looking at apartments.

06:53.323 --> 06:55.691
Well, Paul seems nice enough--

06:55.726 --> 06:57.026
Although we hardly know them.

06:57.060 --> 06:58.494
Actually, I've gotten
to know Joy quite well

06:58.529 --> 06:59.995
since they moved in.

07:00.030 --> 07:02.764
Obviously, my mistake was giving
her "The Feminine Mystique."

07:02.799 --> 07:04.733
I simply said
it was an interesting book,

07:04.767 --> 07:06.969
I never told her it was
an instruction manual.

07:07.003 --> 07:08.404
David Buckland says

07:08.438 --> 07:10.039
we've written the most important
medical book of the decade.

07:10.073 --> 07:11.440
Reshaped the entire field.

07:11.474 --> 07:13.575
Do you think I should tell him?

07:13.609 --> 07:14.843
David Buckland?

07:14.877 --> 07:16.778
No, Paul,
that his wife is leaving him!

07:16.813 --> 07:20.854
Is...
Is that a serious question?

07:20.889 --> 07:22.050
Well, she said
she won't say anything

07:22.084 --> 07:23.685
until her bags are packed.

07:23.719 --> 07:26.421
She says he'll just try
to convince her to stay,

07:26.456 --> 07:28.557
which is exactly
what he should do.

07:28.591 --> 07:31.893
Or maybe you could say that you
overheard the two of us talking,

07:31.928 --> 07:32.761
and tell Paul.

07:32.795 --> 07:35.496
Paul from next door?

07:35.530 --> 07:37.265
I've exchanged four words
with the man.

07:37.299 --> 07:39.067
Yes, but I've shared
three dinners

07:39.101 --> 07:40.368
and one neighborhood pot luck.

07:40.402 --> 07:42.303
And if Paul found out
that I wanted to leave you,

07:42.338 --> 07:43.338
wouldn't you want to know?

07:43.372 --> 07:44.572
Libby, people fantasize

07:44.606 --> 07:46.307
about all sorts of things
that they never do--

07:46.342 --> 07:48.843
This... this is
a preposterous conversation.

07:48.877 --> 07:49.844
And I'm hungry.

07:53.882 --> 07:56.116
The Chinese menu
is in the top drawer.

07:56.150 --> 07:57.384
They deliver until 10:00.

08:01.890 --> 08:03.991
Doctor?

08:04.025 --> 08:06.893
Good morning.

08:06.927 --> 08:08.928
Good morning, may I help you?

08:08.963 --> 08:11.031
"Post Dispatch," "Star Times."

08:11.065 --> 08:12.799
Dr. Masters?

08:12.833 --> 08:15.602
Hi, I've just read your book.

08:15.636 --> 08:18.071
Really?
Are you a physician?

08:18.106 --> 08:19.239
Ronald Sturgis.

08:19.273 --> 08:21.241
No, I'm with the Committee
For Decency.

08:21.275 --> 08:24.711
I've come to tell you
that Hell is a real place.

08:24.745 --> 08:28.948
No worse
than St. Louis in August.

08:28.983 --> 08:30.950
Well, we have God to thank

08:30.985 --> 08:33.052
that Washington University
fired you

08:33.086 --> 08:34.453
before you had the chance

08:34.488 --> 08:37.123
to corrupt your students'
minds with this filth.

08:37.157 --> 08:39.025
What did you say?

08:39.058 --> 08:42.227
I said it's a miracle
you're no longer a teacher,

08:42.261 --> 08:45.631
no longer a in a position to
peddle smut to our young people.

08:45.665 --> 08:47.199
"Know ye not
that the unrighteous

08:47.234 --> 08:48.934
shall not inherit
the kingdom of God?

08:48.968 --> 08:51.637
Now be not deceived-- Neither
fornicators nor idolaters,

08:51.671 --> 08:55.174
nor adulterers, nor feminists,
nor homosexuals, nor thieves--"

08:55.208 --> 08:56.374
What if he had a knife?

08:56.409 --> 08:57.876
He didn't have a knife.

08:57.911 --> 08:59.978
Well, he had something,
'cause you're white as a ghost.

09:00.013 --> 09:01.813
I'm not frightened,
Betty, I'm thinking.

09:01.848 --> 09:03.448
Fine, but while you cogitate,

09:03.482 --> 09:05.350
we're hearing
from every John Birch nut job

09:05.384 --> 09:06.785
with a library card and a stamp.

09:06.819 --> 09:08.854
This one thinks
you work for Red China.

09:08.888 --> 09:11.590
This one thinks the book
is the work of the Antichrist,

09:11.624 --> 09:13.891
and now they're showing up
at our front door?

09:13.926 --> 09:15.093
Lester, wake up.

09:15.127 --> 09:16.561
How many medical students
are there in the US?

09:16.595 --> 09:17.728
30,000 maybe?

09:17.763 --> 09:19.497
I, uh...
I'm not sure.

09:19.532 --> 09:21.499
Well, that's 30,000 copies
of our book

09:21.534 --> 09:22.567
just waiting to be sold.

09:22.601 --> 09:23.668
It could be a textbook.

09:23.702 --> 09:26.337
The standard textbook
on the subject.

09:26.372 --> 09:28.039
We could start
at Washington University,

09:28.074 --> 09:29.640
where the study was born,
after all,

09:29.675 --> 09:30.841
and where we thank them
extensively

09:30.876 --> 09:32.176
in our acknowledgments,

09:32.210 --> 09:34.344
in spite of their abysmal
treatment of us and the work.

09:34.379 --> 09:36.213
But it's the logical
jumping-off point.

09:36.247 --> 09:38.215
Then we could branch out into
schools all across the Midwest.

09:38.249 --> 09:39.650
Build momentum.

09:39.685 --> 09:41.686
Do medical schools
even have courses on sex?

09:41.720 --> 09:43.320
And we'll convince them
that they should.

09:43.354 --> 09:46.022
I hate to rain
on your ticker-tape parade,

09:46.057 --> 09:47.591
but selling medical textbooks

09:47.625 --> 09:49.793
isn't exactly
a get-rich-quick scheme.

09:49.827 --> 09:51.261
It might take some time, yes.

09:51.296 --> 09:54.431
Or you could skip
all that busy work

09:54.466 --> 09:56.633
and take on an investor.

09:56.667 --> 09:59.303
Don't look at me like
I'm the old ball and chain.

09:59.337 --> 10:01.472
You know that we paid
for the research

10:01.506 --> 10:03.607
from the fertility
and gyno patients.

10:03.641 --> 10:06.076
So if you want the research
to be self-sustaining,

10:06.110 --> 10:08.778
and you're certainly making lots
of noise like you do,

10:08.813 --> 10:11.948
then you need
a dedicated source of funding.

10:11.983 --> 10:13.249
That means an investor.

10:13.283 --> 10:15.752
Oh, now's not the time
for an investor.

10:15.786 --> 10:17.420
Now is the perfect time
for an investor--

10:17.454 --> 10:18.854
With the publicity
from the book?!

10:18.888 --> 10:20.523
No, the book just needs
to find the right audience.

10:20.557 --> 10:21.824
The money
will take care of itself.

10:21.858 --> 10:23.993
Get me the Dean of Curricular
of Washington University

10:24.027 --> 10:25.661
on the line and Virginia and I
can set up a meeting

10:25.695 --> 10:26.962
as soon as possible.

10:26.997 --> 10:29.064
You're going to sell
Wash U on the sex class?

10:29.099 --> 10:31.734
No, but Virginia could
sell an airplane to the Amish.

10:31.768 --> 10:32.801
Where is Virginia?

10:32.836 --> 10:34.370
She called in this morning.

10:34.404 --> 10:36.005
There's a problem
with her daughter.

10:36.039 --> 10:37.806
It's not the colic again.

10:37.841 --> 10:40.643
No, not Baby Lisa,
her other daughter.

10:42.812 --> 10:43.912
You're late,

10:43.947 --> 10:45.547
so we're going to have
to discuss this

10:45.581 --> 10:46.615
on the move, Mrs. Johnson.

10:46.650 --> 10:47.983
We're not that late.

10:48.018 --> 10:49.985
This is not the first time

10:50.020 --> 10:51.886
we have spoken
about Tessa's behavior.

10:51.920 --> 10:54.489
I'm doubly disappointed
on the lack of improvement.

10:54.524 --> 10:55.790
Although, truth be told,

10:55.824 --> 10:58.560
students with divorced parents
often act out like this.

10:58.594 --> 11:00.995
Well,
that would not apply to Tessa,

11:01.030 --> 11:03.831
since Mr. Johnson and I
are married.

11:03.866 --> 11:05.433
Remarried as of two months ago.

11:05.468 --> 11:07.068
They don't technically
live together.

11:07.102 --> 11:08.435
That is not the case.

11:08.470 --> 11:11.605
Whatever
your arrangement, you're here

11:11.640 --> 11:14.942
because Tessa skipped her
afternoon classes two days ago,

11:14.977 --> 11:18.112
then showed up yesterday
with a forged note-- again!

11:18.147 --> 11:21.549
I'm considering all disciplinary
action, including barring Tessa

11:21.583 --> 11:23.818
from tomorrow night's
homecoming dance.

11:23.852 --> 11:27.888
I know your work keeps you
very busy, Mrs. Johnson,

11:27.922 --> 11:31.592
but please remember
children learn by example.

11:36.698 --> 11:40.000
What did I tell you
about skipping class--

11:40.034 --> 11:42.368
That Sister Annabelle's
watching you like a hawk!

11:42.403 --> 11:44.537
You have to admit,
I've got your signature down.

11:44.572 --> 11:45.872
And I would appreciate

11:45.907 --> 11:47.307
you not spreading
around the fact

11:47.341 --> 11:49.042
that your father and I
don't live together.

11:49.077 --> 11:50.777
It might give people
the wrong impression.

11:50.812 --> 11:52.579
What would
the right impression be?

11:52.613 --> 11:54.280
It's nobody's business, Tessa.

11:54.315 --> 11:56.083
Well, grandma thought
I made the whole thing up.

11:56.117 --> 11:57.383
Wait!
You spoke to grandma?

11:57.418 --> 11:59.519
You know
grandma and I are close.

11:59.553 --> 12:02.589
She said if she were my age and
her whole school had found out

12:02.623 --> 12:05.658
that her mom had written some
sex book, she'd skip class, too.

12:05.693 --> 12:07.126
What are you talking about?

12:07.160 --> 12:08.961
You have no idea, do you?

12:08.995 --> 12:11.964
The nightmare my life has become
since your book came out.

12:11.998 --> 12:14.600
No one will sit near me
at lunch.

12:14.634 --> 12:16.869
People scribble
disgusting things on my locker.

12:16.903 --> 12:19.739
When I walk in a room, people
whisper, "There's Tessa Johnson,

12:19.773 --> 12:22.174
the girl whose mom watches
people have sex all day."

12:22.209 --> 12:25.845
Why didn't you
talk to me about this?

12:25.879 --> 12:28.080
Talk to you when?
You have me three nights a week,

12:28.115 --> 12:29.949
and when I am there,
you're busy with the baby.

12:33.620 --> 12:35.987
Oh, I'm sorry.

12:36.021 --> 12:37.856
Are we not supposed
to mention the baby, either?

12:43.829 --> 12:47.665
In the second half of the
course, then, the focus shifts,

12:47.699 --> 12:51.369
gradually to metabolic and
glandular changes to the body

12:51.403 --> 12:52.703
during sex.

12:52.738 --> 12:57.475
Of course, ultimately,
concludes with geriatric sex.

12:59.678 --> 13:02.446
Do you have any questions?

13:02.481 --> 13:05.149
Well,
it's certainly impressive work

13:05.183 --> 13:08.185
that you and your partner
have done, Dr. Masters.

13:08.219 --> 13:11.021
I only wish that I had been here
during your tenure.

13:11.055 --> 13:12.323
I could have learned so much.

13:12.357 --> 13:14.258
Thank you.
I-- I appreciate you--

13:14.293 --> 13:19.229
Although... I'm not sure
Wash U is any more ready now

13:19.264 --> 13:23.167
for an entire course on sexual
response than they were then.

13:24.735 --> 13:27.905
But I'll run it by my colleagues
and get back to you.

13:27.939 --> 13:29.739
We'll call you.

13:29.774 --> 13:33.210
Well... thank you,

13:33.244 --> 13:35.412
uh, for making the time
to see us.

13:35.446 --> 13:37.747
I'll await your call.

13:37.782 --> 13:45.422
Until then, I-- I hope
we've... aroused your curiosity.

13:45.456 --> 13:47.924
If nothing else.

13:51.729 --> 13:54.096
Well, I wouldn't put it
in a stand-up routine,

13:54.131 --> 13:55.264
but it was not a bad joke.

13:55.299 --> 13:56.632
It wasn't meant to be a joke.

13:56.666 --> 13:58.000
Well, it was, and it worked.

13:58.035 --> 13:59.836
How exactly did it work, Lester?

13:59.870 --> 14:01.237
He didn't agree to the course.

14:01.271 --> 14:03.105
He's obviously considering it.

14:03.140 --> 14:04.307
Well, if he was sold,

14:04.341 --> 14:06.142
he would have said yes
right there in the room.

14:06.176 --> 14:08.878
It's over?
In 20 minutes?

14:08.912 --> 14:11.279
Would you give us
a moment, Lester?

14:13.450 --> 14:16.318
Well, what happened?
What did he say?

14:16.353 --> 14:18.186
He said
he would give us a call.

14:18.221 --> 14:19.855
Oh.

14:19.889 --> 14:23.692
Well, maybe we should make
a longer presentation next time.

14:23.727 --> 14:25.260
Next time?
Oh, there'll be no next time.

14:25.294 --> 14:27.262
There's right now and there's
too late, those are the options.

14:27.296 --> 14:29.164
Bill, I heard about
this meeting 30 minutes ago.

14:29.198 --> 14:30.932
I raced here from the office.

14:30.967 --> 14:32.667
Maybe if you'd been
at the office on time.

14:32.701 --> 14:33.935
I got called
from Tessa's principal

14:33.970 --> 14:35.270
at 7:00 AM--

14:35.304 --> 14:36.804
I understand
you have a lot on your plate,

14:36.839 --> 14:38.773
but, honestly, Virginia, if you
can't commit to this schedule--

14:38.807 --> 14:40.475
Of course I can commit.

14:40.509 --> 14:42.377
I'm here, right now, committed.

14:42.411 --> 14:44.278
And what happened this morning,

14:44.312 --> 14:46.881
I can assure you,
will not happen again.

14:53.422 --> 14:57.057
Are you ready for chapter four?

14:57.092 --> 15:02.796
"This localized area of...
bulbar vasocongestion

15:02.830 --> 15:05.132
contracts strongly
in a recurring pattern

15:05.166 --> 15:06.901
during the orgasmic expression."

15:06.935 --> 15:09.803
Translation?

15:09.837 --> 15:14.541
When a girl starts...
you know...

15:14.575 --> 15:17.411
I don't think
that I do know, actually.

15:17.445 --> 15:23.550
When a girl has an
orgasm, it feels really good.

15:23.584 --> 15:26.319
Really?

15:26.353 --> 15:28.688
And then
after she has the orgasm,

15:28.723 --> 15:32.358
obviously, she has a lot
of bulbar vasocongestion.

15:36.163 --> 15:37.696
Have you read "The Story Of O"?

15:37.731 --> 15:39.933
It's French,
so all of the characters

15:39.967 --> 15:42.168
are going all the way,
all the time.

15:42.202 --> 15:45.905
Andy Zeitlin,
his mom has a copy.

15:45.940 --> 15:49.374
His mom is a... nympho.

15:49.409 --> 15:52.645
You know what a nympho is,
right?

15:52.679 --> 15:55.113
It's when a girl
really likes sex.

15:55.148 --> 15:57.416
All girls really like sex.

15:57.451 --> 15:59.384
How do you know that?

15:59.419 --> 16:02.822
You... you've done it?

16:02.856 --> 16:04.122
Haven't you?

16:04.157 --> 16:06.191
Yeah.

16:06.225 --> 16:07.725
Definitely.

16:09.963 --> 16:12.697
Anyway...
What happens next?

16:12.731 --> 16:14.732
Oh, yeah.

16:14.767 --> 16:18.670
All right, "Chapter Five,
The Clitoris."

16:31.016 --> 16:34.853
Mrs. Johnson.
I've read your book.

16:34.887 --> 16:36.521
Have you?

16:42.461 --> 16:44.328
Congratulations
on all your success.

16:56.975 --> 17:00.010
My goodness,
what are we celebrating?

17:00.044 --> 17:01.411
Apparently, Hef isn't above

17:01.445 --> 17:03.079
shameless and much-appreciated
gift giving.

17:03.114 --> 17:04.781
Hugh Hefner sent us champagne?

17:04.816 --> 17:06.182
I still don't understand

17:06.217 --> 17:07.851
why he wants to invest
in our research.

17:07.886 --> 17:09.219
It's not just Hef.

17:09.252 --> 17:10.787
I told you, the phone has been
ringing off the hook.

17:10.821 --> 17:14.790
I've got this big-shot perfume
guy from New York who wants in.

17:14.825 --> 17:16.858
Some millionaire from Tucson.

17:16.894 --> 17:18.261
Makes electric hand massagers.

17:18.295 --> 17:19.561
A hand massage company?

17:19.596 --> 17:20.663
And who says a girl

17:20.696 --> 17:22.332
only uses a hand massager
on her hands?

17:22.366 --> 17:23.633
They're eager to meet,

17:23.666 --> 17:25.768
can't wait to put their money
where our mouth is.

17:25.801 --> 17:27.503
Anyway, it's gotta be this week,

17:27.538 --> 17:29.705
'cause Hef's back to Chicago
on Friday

17:29.740 --> 17:31.340
for the playmate pajama party.

17:31.374 --> 17:33.375
I'm not interested in pajamas.

17:33.410 --> 17:35.244
We need to focus
on the textbook.

17:35.278 --> 17:37.713
Oh, because everybody
knows there's a fortune

17:37.748 --> 17:39.181
to be made in medical textbooks.

17:39.215 --> 17:40.382
Because our book

17:40.417 --> 17:42.885
could change the face
of medical education.

17:42.920 --> 17:45.087
And yet here we are, as always,
quibbling over money.

17:46.656 --> 17:48.924
If people want
to throw money at us

17:48.958 --> 17:51.193
because they believe
in the work we're doing,

17:51.227 --> 17:52.727
we could at least listen, right?

17:52.762 --> 17:54.029
Let Betty and I meet,

17:54.064 --> 17:55.730
and you and Lester can stay
with the textbook.

17:55.765 --> 17:57.832
Oh, you're gonna meet
potential investors?

17:57.867 --> 18:00.001
You can barely keep up
with the work as it is.

18:00.036 --> 18:02.437
It's not a problem, Bill.

18:02.471 --> 18:04.172
Betty and I can handle it.

18:04.206 --> 18:06.007
And I will rededicate
myself to the book,

18:06.042 --> 18:08.409
despite the fact that that means
long days and sleepless nights,

18:08.444 --> 18:09.945
since I don't sleep anyways

18:09.979 --> 18:12.681
with my screaming kids
and morbidly grumpy wife.

18:12.715 --> 18:13.882
It's Jane, Lester.

18:13.916 --> 18:15.216
Oh, is it?

18:15.250 --> 18:17.518
'Cause it's certainly not
the Jane I fell in love with.

18:17.553 --> 18:19.153
Oh, it's most definitely Jane.

18:21.523 --> 18:24.858
Look who it is.
It's Jane!

18:27.529 --> 18:31.031
I am...
so sorry to interrupt

18:31.066 --> 18:33.867
your mentally stimulating
and fulfilling day,

18:33.902 --> 18:36.136
but this morbidly grumpy
housewife

18:36.170 --> 18:39.707
is taking a little time away
from spit-up and dirty diapers

18:39.741 --> 18:43.777
to bring her husband a homemade
turkey sandwich and a Twinkie.

18:48.349 --> 18:50.450
We're always so happy
to see you, Jane.

18:52.987 --> 18:56.789
But we made this plan
together, Joy-- weeks ago.

18:56.824 --> 18:58.458
I know,
but tonight's the only night

18:58.493 --> 18:59.559
that's good for the realtor.

18:59.594 --> 19:00.827
Goodness,
I feel like this realtor

19:00.861 --> 19:02.229
has taken over our lives.

19:02.263 --> 19:05.165
Okay, I'm sorry, Libby.
I didn't mean to upset you.

19:05.199 --> 19:06.600
I'm not upset.

19:06.634 --> 19:09.268
We just have leaflets to pass
out before the Boycott

19:09.302 --> 19:13.740
and another book to pick out
before the next book group

19:13.774 --> 19:16.709
and we have things
that we started together, Joy.

19:19.713 --> 19:22.515
I simply mean if Cesar Chavez
can walk 300 miles

19:22.549 --> 19:24.650
to the California
state capital--

19:24.684 --> 19:26.385
You can walk, too, Libby.

19:26.419 --> 19:28.654
Walk away, I mean.

19:32.825 --> 19:34.893
Walk away from my life?

19:36.095 --> 19:38.564
Like you?

19:41.367 --> 19:42.600
Don't be silly.

19:42.635 --> 19:45.671
If you're unhappy
in your marriage.

19:45.705 --> 19:47.973
Because I complain
about Bill's hours?

19:48.007 --> 19:49.975
Everyone complains, Joy.

19:50.009 --> 19:52.210
Plus, I have children.

19:52.244 --> 19:55.213
And I'm not unhappy.

19:55.247 --> 19:57.448
No, of course not.

19:57.483 --> 19:59.016
And you have
so much ahead of you

19:59.051 --> 20:00.418
with Bill's book being released.

20:00.452 --> 20:03.788
And, I mean, he's being written
about in "Time Magazine,"

20:03.822 --> 20:05.290
for crying out loud.

20:05.324 --> 20:08.059
I can't imagine what it's like
to share in all that with him.

20:10.996 --> 20:14.565
When Paul first fell in love
with me,

20:14.599 --> 20:16.167
I'm not exaggerating, Lib,

20:16.201 --> 20:18.869
when I say that
all the girls were jealous.

20:18.904 --> 20:22.339
I had landed the most beautiful
boy, the all-state quarterback,

20:22.373 --> 20:23.774
and not only that,

20:23.809 --> 20:26.911
the boy who wanted to write
the great American novel

20:26.945 --> 20:28.179
and move to Morocco.

20:28.213 --> 20:31.515
Paul had so many dreams.

20:31.549 --> 20:33.684
But that was a long time ago.

20:33.718 --> 20:37.321
And Paul, I mean,
he's a good teacher,

20:37.355 --> 20:39.656
a fine coach, a nice husband.

20:39.691 --> 20:43.527
But not one of those dreams
has come true.

20:43.561 --> 20:46.196
And I don't see that changing.

20:46.230 --> 20:49.733
Which means the rest of my life

20:49.767 --> 20:55.638
is this straight, flat highway
right into the sunset.

21:00.310 --> 21:04.146
I will go with you tomorrow
night to pass out leaflets,

21:04.180 --> 21:05.481
I promise.

21:05.515 --> 21:09.585
Just come with me to see
the apartment tonight.

21:09.620 --> 21:12.821
Please?
I know you don't approve.

21:12.856 --> 21:16.158
I could use a friend, anyway.

21:16.192 --> 21:18.227
Sorry I'm late.

21:18.262 --> 21:20.095
Staying for dinner, Joy?

21:20.130 --> 21:23.565
Actually,
Joy and I already ate.

21:23.599 --> 21:28.270
Um, we have Boycott work
to do tonight.

21:28.304 --> 21:30.605
I did make a casserole
for you and Paul.

21:30.640 --> 21:32.808
For?

21:32.842 --> 21:34.676
I invited Paul
over to join you.

21:34.710 --> 21:37.545
We thought you could
keep each other company...

21:37.580 --> 21:39.681
and give you a chance to talk.

21:44.687 --> 21:45.987
<i>St. Louis threatening.</i>

21:46.021 --> 21:47.088
<i>Back to throw.</i>

21:47.122 --> 21:48.456
<i>He's got a man</i>
<i>on the sidelines,</i>

21:48.491 --> 21:49.624
<i>batted out of bounds.</i>

21:49.659 --> 21:50.858
<i>Incomplete.</i>

21:50.893 --> 21:53.427
Well, I--
I saw an article in the paper

21:53.461 --> 21:54.528
about your book.

21:54.562 --> 21:56.330
Something about sexual...

21:56.364 --> 21:58.266
"Human Sexual Response."

21:58.300 --> 21:59.433
That's it.

21:59.467 --> 22:01.235
Uh, in fact,

22:01.270 --> 22:06.040
I-- I still have quite
a lot of work to do tonight.

22:06.074 --> 22:08.375
You know, those academic
books can really sell,

22:08.410 --> 22:10.444
especially if you get them
onto a curriculum,

22:10.478 --> 22:12.680
get the medical schools
to use them as a textbook.

22:12.714 --> 22:16.450
Yeah, that's exactly
what I'm trying to do.

22:16.484 --> 22:20.086
Yeah. Well, I look forward
to reading it.

22:20.121 --> 22:21.689
Although, I don't know.

22:21.723 --> 22:23.390
Doesn't sound like
the kind of title

22:23.425 --> 22:25.325
a married man should have
on his bookshelf.

22:25.359 --> 22:27.027
Actually, we think of the work

22:27.061 --> 22:28.428
as a way to strengthen marriage.

22:28.462 --> 22:30.496
Dissatisfaction in the bedroom

22:30.531 --> 22:33.433
is one of the leading causes
of divorce.

22:33.467 --> 22:34.734
No kidding.

22:34.768 --> 22:36.002
Well, luckily, Joy and I

22:36.037 --> 22:38.571
have never had any trouble
in that department, so...

22:41.942 --> 22:44.910
<i>He's back to throw again.</i>

22:44.945 --> 22:47.046
<i>- He's got a man on the side.</i>
<i>- Jesus.</i>

22:47.080 --> 22:49.215
Anderson left the receiver
wide open.

22:49.249 --> 22:50.483
It's like déjà vu.

22:50.517 --> 22:51.751
This is just like a game

22:51.785 --> 22:53.786
I played against
Washington State once.

22:53.821 --> 22:55.455
You played college ball?

22:55.489 --> 22:57.523
Yeah,
about a thousand years ago.

22:57.558 --> 22:59.658
I was quarterback in Nebraska.

22:59.692 --> 23:03.062
Paul Edley, you're--

23:03.096 --> 23:04.363
You're...

23:04.397 --> 23:06.999
That Paul edley, yeah.

23:07.033 --> 23:08.800
Washington State game.

23:08.835 --> 23:10.736
That-- that was
the 1949 Rose Bowl.

23:10.770 --> 23:12.872
It was.
And by the fourth quarter,

23:12.906 --> 23:15.440
my two best receivers were
headed to the emergency room.

23:15.475 --> 23:17.308
So we're fourth and goal,

23:17.343 --> 23:19.811
I don't know,
40 seconds on the clock...

23:19.846 --> 23:21.145
And down by six.

23:21.180 --> 23:22.447
That's right,

23:22.482 --> 23:25.484
and the second I got the snap,
all I could see was red.

23:25.518 --> 23:27.386
I mean, my offensive line
was Swiss cheese.

23:27.420 --> 23:28.587
These guys were pouring in.

23:28.621 --> 23:31.055
I had maybe three seconds
till I was down.

23:31.090 --> 23:32.090
Next thing I know, I look up,

23:32.124 --> 23:33.391
and I'm standing
in the end zone.

23:33.425 --> 23:34.859
You had
to run the ball yourself.

23:34.894 --> 23:38.329
Yeah, sometimes, that's...

23:38.364 --> 23:40.965
that's the only way.

23:49.974 --> 23:52.009
I want to show you something.

23:57.849 --> 24:03.086
1933 football star set,
mint condition.

24:03.121 --> 24:07.857
It took me two years to put
this whole collection together.

24:07.892 --> 24:10.727
Hmm.

24:10.761 --> 24:13.897
Those look, um...
those look pretty great.

24:13.932 --> 24:16.733
Look at this.

24:16.767 --> 24:17.867
Ah, yeah.

24:17.902 --> 24:19.269
Ed Weir.

24:19.304 --> 24:22.405
Captain
of the 1923 Nebraska team.

24:22.440 --> 24:24.908
He was.

24:24.942 --> 24:29.412
Oh. George Wilson--
"Wildcat" Wilson.

24:29.447 --> 24:30.680
Yep.

24:30.714 --> 24:32.916
37 career touchdowns
in college ball,

24:32.950 --> 24:35.452
then he goes on to win
the NFL championship in '28.

24:35.486 --> 24:37.386
Yeah, I did love the Wildcat.

24:37.421 --> 24:38.754
Yeah.

24:38.788 --> 24:42.058
I have to say I'm not much
of a card collector,

24:42.092 --> 24:44.526
but it's clear
this is quite the set.

24:58.207 --> 24:59.741
Um...

25:03.546 --> 25:04.980
Ernie Nevers.

25:05.014 --> 25:07.749
Hmm.

25:07.784 --> 25:11.453
Single greatest fullback
in the history of football.

25:11.487 --> 25:13.021
Oh.
I don't know about that.

25:13.055 --> 25:14.122
Paul, I do know.

25:14.156 --> 25:15.756
One of the older boys in school,

25:15.791 --> 25:18.259
he said he would give this one
to me for $5.00.

25:18.294 --> 25:20.828
Well, it might as well
have been $500.

25:20.863 --> 25:23.865
And I got my pal Wally to go in
on it with me.

25:23.899 --> 25:27.568
It took me and Wally
a month of shoveling driveways

25:27.603 --> 25:29.670
to scrape together the money.

25:29.705 --> 25:30.905
Then at the last minute,
Wally pulled out.

25:30.939 --> 25:32.406
Oh.

25:32.440 --> 25:34.775
I spent another month
and a half in the snow,

25:34.810 --> 25:36.410
trying to make up
the difference.

25:36.444 --> 25:40.180
Well, you know, it's like
we were saying before--

25:40.215 --> 25:43.683
Sometimes you gotta...
you gotta do it on your own.

25:43.718 --> 25:46.620
Right?

25:50.258 --> 25:52.726
<i>I-- I didn't know!</i>

25:52.760 --> 25:54.928
Hello?

25:57.065 --> 26:01.868
I have a cheeseburger
from D&W, no less.

26:01.903 --> 26:03.937
I already ate dinner.

26:03.971 --> 26:05.739
A bag of potato chips?

26:05.773 --> 26:07.140
That's not dinner, Tessa.

26:07.174 --> 26:09.609
Grandma called-- again.

26:09.644 --> 26:11.845
She wants you to call her back.

26:11.879 --> 26:15.615
I also made
a little stop at Vandervoort's

26:15.650 --> 26:16.916
on my way home.

26:29.663 --> 26:33.933
Grandma bought me a dress just
like that for my homecoming.

26:33.967 --> 26:35.935
It's pretty.

26:38.304 --> 26:41.406
And do you have a date
for tomorrow night?

26:41.441 --> 26:43.308
It's not that kind of dance.

26:43.342 --> 26:45.778
That's not what
Sister Annabelle said.

26:45.812 --> 26:47.379
I saw on the school bulletin

26:47.413 --> 26:50.182
that they were looking
for parents to chaperone,

26:50.216 --> 26:52.250
so I called Sister Annabelle,
and--

26:52.285 --> 26:54.252
- You didn't.
- I did.

26:54.287 --> 26:58.190
I thought about what you said,
and you're right.

26:58.224 --> 27:00.425
Between Lisa and everything

27:00.460 --> 27:01.893
that's been going on at work
lately,

27:01.927 --> 27:04.162
I think it's a good idea for us
to spend more time together.

27:04.197 --> 27:05.363
Oh, my God.

27:05.398 --> 27:07.699
That hardly sounds like,

27:07.733 --> 27:09.300
"Oh, my God, I'm so excited."

27:09.334 --> 27:10.768
You're kidding.

27:10.803 --> 27:13.437
The second you walk in that
school, everyone's gonna say,

27:13.472 --> 27:14.973
"Look, there goes the sex mom."

27:15.007 --> 27:18.542
Our entire school
knows who you are.

27:18.577 --> 27:22.213
You're infamous now,
so if you're going, I'm not.

27:27.452 --> 27:30.621
All right, well...

27:30.655 --> 27:32.323
If you don't want to go
to the dance,

27:32.357 --> 27:34.958
then there's no reason
to keep the dress, is there?

27:38.896 --> 27:40.030
I got calls back

27:40.064 --> 27:41.932
from Illinois, Indiana,
and Wisconsin.

27:41.966 --> 27:44.467
They're open to discussing the
book as a potential textbook,

27:44.502 --> 27:46.402
but they do want to hear
about it from you.

27:46.437 --> 27:47.771
Washington University?

27:47.805 --> 27:49.572
Yeah.
They haven't called yet.

27:49.607 --> 27:50.774
We could try calling them.

27:50.808 --> 27:53.977
Didn't you wear
that same tie yesterday?

27:54.012 --> 27:57.380
My wardrobe options
are limited at the moment.

27:57.414 --> 27:59.482
It's not like I'm gonna be
sleeping at the office forever.

27:59.517 --> 28:00.983
Here's hoping.

28:01.018 --> 28:04.287
I've got our investor meeting
set up for tonight, Virginia,

28:04.321 --> 28:07.123
since the earliest
Hef could do was 9:00 PM.

28:07.158 --> 28:09.825
Turns out
he's a bit of a night owl.

28:09.860 --> 28:11.827
Is tonight not good for you?

28:11.862 --> 28:14.997
No, tonight's fine.

28:15.032 --> 28:16.799
I might have to rearrange
a few things,

28:16.833 --> 28:18.868
but I said I would be there,
so I'll be there.

28:18.902 --> 28:20.636
Which calls would you
like me to return?

28:20.671 --> 28:22.705
Your hands are full.
I'll take care of it.

28:31.013 --> 28:33.948
Hello, this is Dr. Masters.

28:33.983 --> 28:37.152
Yes, Bill Masters.
I'm calling to speak to...

28:37.187 --> 28:38.720
Dr. Swanson.
Bob Grayson.

28:38.754 --> 28:40.589
Is Dr. Stern available?

28:40.623 --> 28:41.923
I was impressed, Dr. Kraft,

28:41.957 --> 28:45.560
by your symposium
on ovarian torsion.

28:45.594 --> 28:47.628
...your seminar
on endometriosis.

28:47.663 --> 28:48.730
...study on fibroids.

28:50.532 --> 28:51.966
So did you see the review?

28:52.001 --> 28:54.335
The write-up
in the "Scientific--"

28:54.369 --> 28:55.503
Oh, this is the first call
I'm making.

28:55.537 --> 28:56.738
The first medical school...

28:56.772 --> 28:59.140
Isn't it time a medical school
jumps on board?

28:59.175 --> 29:01.942
A comprehensive course
on the physiology...

29:01.976 --> 29:04.612
Sexual response...
Sexual response...

29:04.646 --> 29:06.647
Sex. Human sexual...

29:06.682 --> 29:08.416
Sex. Hello?

29:13.388 --> 29:14.755
The book, a textbook.

29:14.789 --> 29:16.557
Using the book as a textbook.

29:16.592 --> 29:18.692
It would not be
a how-to course, no.

29:18.727 --> 29:21.528
Well, you wouldn't want
the University of Minnesota...

29:21.562 --> 29:23.764
Kansas City...
Chicago beating you to...

29:23.798 --> 29:25.298
The cutting edge...
Cutting edge...

29:25.333 --> 29:28.135
That is exactly
where Ohio State should be.

29:28.169 --> 29:29.703
All right, we'll be in touch.

29:29.738 --> 29:34.541
And, well, my hope is at least
I've aroused your curiosity.

29:34.575 --> 29:38.410
I hope I've aroused your
curiosity, if nothing else.

29:41.882 --> 29:43.182
Excellent.

29:43.217 --> 29:45.818
Our publisher will be in touch
to set up the order.

29:45.853 --> 29:48.988
Any more calls?

29:49.022 --> 29:51.891
Toledo and Madison.

29:51.925 --> 29:54.093
How about
Washington University?

29:54.128 --> 29:55.227
Not a peep.

29:56.896 --> 29:59.197
Get Wash U on the line.

29:59.232 --> 30:02.000
Okey-doke.

30:02.034 --> 30:04.836
Never mind,
don't get Wash U on the line.

30:04.871 --> 30:06.772
Okay.

30:15.848 --> 30:19.184
Hello, Barton.
I'm sorry to stop by like this.

30:19.218 --> 30:20.451
I tried to call, but...

30:20.486 --> 30:22.921
Oh, no, I've been out.

30:27.026 --> 30:28.959
To what do I owe the pleasure?

30:28.994 --> 30:31.696
Well, I wanted to bend your ear

30:31.730 --> 30:33.665
about Washington University.

30:33.699 --> 30:36.401
Honey, did we
already open the wine?

30:36.435 --> 30:40.104
Oh, I didn't know
we had company.

30:42.140 --> 30:44.608
So last night when I told
you not to go to the dance,

30:44.642 --> 30:45.976
you completely refuse.

30:46.011 --> 30:48.045
And then today, you called
Sister Annabelle out of the blue

30:48.079 --> 30:49.646
and told her
you changed your mind?

30:49.681 --> 30:51.581
Well, you made it very clear

30:51.616 --> 30:53.117
that I would embarrass you,

30:53.151 --> 30:56.220
and that is the last thing that
I want to do-- embarrass you.

30:56.254 --> 30:57.321
You have work, don't you?

30:57.355 --> 30:58.989
Tessa.

30:59.024 --> 31:02.091
I have some meetings
that came up, yes,

31:02.126 --> 31:05.796
but that is not why I cancelled
the chaperoning.

31:05.830 --> 31:07.431
But even if I had,
I don't understand

31:07.465 --> 31:09.065
what you're getting
so worked up about.

31:09.099 --> 31:10.934
'Cause I wanted you
not to go to the dance

31:10.968 --> 31:12.636
because I asked you
not to go to the dance.

31:12.670 --> 31:14.338
Not because of work.

31:14.372 --> 31:16.707
Well, now you're just
being deliberately difficult.

31:16.741 --> 31:19.108
I will pick you up at 10:00.

31:19.143 --> 31:21.311
And don't forget, you're staying
at your dad's tonight.

31:21.345 --> 31:23.512
And, honey, you look...

31:23.547 --> 31:24.981
...pretty.

31:28.385 --> 31:30.153
I also have a berry cobbler,

31:30.187 --> 31:32.155
so I hope everybody
saved plenty of room.

31:32.189 --> 31:33.789
Oh!
Before I met Judith,

31:33.824 --> 31:35.391
I didn't know it was possible

31:35.425 --> 31:37.526
to go up two pants sizes
in one meal.

31:38.562 --> 31:40.429
He's always teasing me,
this one.

31:47.036 --> 31:48.771
So how did you two...

31:48.805 --> 31:50.038
Oh, Judith lives upstairs.

31:50.073 --> 31:52.875
Used to run into each other
in the elevator.

31:52.909 --> 31:54.243
Every time she saw me,

31:54.277 --> 31:56.845
I had a grocery bag
full of frozen dinners.

31:56.880 --> 31:59.281
One night, the doorbell rang,

31:59.315 --> 32:02.985
and there she was--
With homemade lasagna.

32:04.220 --> 32:06.888
You had a question
about Wash U?

32:06.922 --> 32:11.393
Uh, yes.
So I've been...

32:11.427 --> 32:13.094
I've been talking
to medical schools

32:13.128 --> 32:14.896
about using our study
as a textbook.

32:14.930 --> 32:19.033
I had... an encouraging meeting

32:19.067 --> 32:23.437
with Dean Snyder at Wash U,
but... I haven't heard back.

32:25.941 --> 32:27.141
I can ask around,
if you'd like.

32:27.175 --> 32:28.442
I'm sure Chancellor Fitzhugh

32:28.476 --> 32:31.112
has mixed feelings
about the book.

32:31.146 --> 32:32.579
I wouldn't know.

32:32.614 --> 32:35.116
I don't remember the last
conversation I had with Fitzhugh

32:35.150 --> 32:37.418
that lasted longer than
a "How are you" in the hall.

32:37.452 --> 32:42.188
When I came back to Wash U,
I gave up the provo job.

32:42.223 --> 32:44.691
Couldn't wait to get back
to doctoring.

32:44.726 --> 32:47.227
Now I come in at 7:00,
I leave at 5:00.

32:47.261 --> 32:48.662
And the best part is,

32:48.696 --> 32:51.665
I'm done toadying up
to the likes of Fitzhugh.

32:51.699 --> 32:52.933
You should be done, too.

32:52.967 --> 32:54.267
I'm not toadying.

32:54.302 --> 32:56.502
Oh, but you'll be doing
plenty of that, and more,

32:56.537 --> 32:58.271
if you're trying to get
your book in there.

32:58.306 --> 33:00.840
Wash U is where the...
It's where the study started.

33:00.874 --> 33:02.675
It's also where you were fired.

33:02.709 --> 33:04.444
Your book is a success, Bill.

33:04.478 --> 33:07.280
You don't need to tilt
at windmills anymore.

33:07.315 --> 33:10.150
Wash U is the number-one
school in the Midwest.

33:10.184 --> 33:11.418
I spent 15 years there.

33:11.452 --> 33:14.086
My practice got them
national attention.

33:14.120 --> 33:16.889
Wash U is where the book
belongs, Barton.

33:25.699 --> 33:27.266
I do know Fitzhugh

33:27.300 --> 33:30.336
is hosting a faculty
cocktail party tonight.

33:31.871 --> 33:35.507
I had no intention of going.

33:38.978 --> 33:41.880
So I figured
who doesn't like roast beef?

33:41.914 --> 33:43.615
- Am I right?
- Right!

33:43.650 --> 33:47.351
So your partner is
the doctor of the operation,

33:47.386 --> 33:48.853
and that makes you...

33:48.888 --> 33:51.089
I'm the psychologist.

33:51.123 --> 33:52.490
Oh,
so you're both head doctors.

33:52.524 --> 33:55.393
You do the big head,
he does the little guy!

33:58.097 --> 34:00.531
Shalimar.
A classic.

34:00.566 --> 34:03.100
Named after an emperor's wife.

34:03.134 --> 34:05.636
Actually, named after a garden

34:05.671 --> 34:07.738
the emperor built for his wife.

34:07.772 --> 34:12.310
Now, you, on the other hand...

34:12.344 --> 34:14.612
are a little harder to pin down.

34:14.646 --> 34:18.416
Well, actually,
I don't wear perfume.

34:18.449 --> 34:20.417
It makes me queasy when I eat.

34:20.451 --> 34:23.821
Allow me to introduce
the Velvet Touch--

34:23.855 --> 34:27.824
Electric Heated
Hand Massager 3000.

34:27.859 --> 34:33.130
This little baby is guaranteed
to cure migraines,

34:33.164 --> 34:34.697
cramps, muscle spasms.

34:34.733 --> 34:37.934
It also helps, or so I'm told,

34:37.967 --> 34:40.670
in relieving certain
pelvic pressures.

34:40.705 --> 34:43.540
So what makes someone
in the perfume industry--

34:43.574 --> 34:45.574
Flavors and fragrance industry,

34:45.610 --> 34:46.976
and it's not just perfume.

34:47.010 --> 34:50.112
We also do food additives,
soaps, hand lotions.

34:50.147 --> 34:51.781
My error entirely.

34:51.815 --> 34:53.349
So what makes someone

34:53.382 --> 34:55.217
in the flavors
and fragrances industry

34:55.252 --> 34:57.085
interested in sex research,
Mr. Logan?

34:57.121 --> 34:59.488
Well, as a doctor,
I'm sure you know--

34:59.522 --> 35:01.457
I'm not a medical doctor.

35:01.491 --> 35:02.892
My degree is in psychology.

35:02.926 --> 35:05.361
With your science
and my engineering,

35:05.395 --> 35:07.529
we could completely
revolutionize

35:07.564 --> 35:09.765
the electric hand-massaging
industry

35:09.799 --> 35:14.202
from top to bottom,
pun intended.

35:15.305 --> 35:17.306
There are two questions

35:17.340 --> 35:20.409
that have puzzled me
in my entire career.

35:20.443 --> 35:24.780
I think maybe we can answer
those questions together.

35:24.814 --> 35:27.482
And what might
those questions be?

35:27.516 --> 35:30.152
What is the smell of sex?

35:30.186 --> 35:34.355
And how do we get it
in a bottle?

35:34.390 --> 35:36.958
If you got caught having sex,

35:36.993 --> 35:38.526
first you'd be whipped publicly.

35:38.560 --> 35:41.362
Then you'd be taken to another
location and whipped again.

35:41.397 --> 35:44.299
After your second infraction,
it was a hot iron to the face.

35:44.333 --> 35:46.267
God bless the pilgrims.

35:46.302 --> 35:48.969
First in a long line
of self-righteous schoolmarms

35:49.004 --> 35:52.106
appointing themselves the moral
guardians of the free world.

35:52.140 --> 35:54.676
But you are going
to change all that.

35:54.710 --> 35:57.044
One centerfold at a time.

35:57.078 --> 35:59.746
I detect a little
skepticism in your voices.

35:59.781 --> 36:02.049
Well,
you're sitting with a shrink

36:02.083 --> 36:04.885
and a student of human nature,
let's say.

36:04.920 --> 36:07.587
So skepticism
is our bread and butter.

36:07.622 --> 36:10.291
Besides,
I doubt this is the first time

36:10.325 --> 36:13.060
that someone has questioned
the sincerity of a man

36:13.094 --> 36:15.696
whose employees wear
fuzzy ears and cottontails.

36:15.730 --> 36:19.766
This? This is all just
candy coating on the Aspirin.

36:19.801 --> 36:22.902
We're both offering
the same medicine here,

36:22.937 --> 36:25.071
only I know how
to get folks to take it.

36:25.105 --> 36:28.208
"Human Sexual Response"
has already sold 4,000 copies.

36:28.242 --> 36:30.877
And I sell
4 million magazines a month.

36:30.911 --> 36:33.112
I know science is expensive.

36:33.147 --> 36:34.747
I have a foundation

36:34.781 --> 36:37.817
ready to provide whatever
financial support you may need.

36:37.852 --> 36:40.286
Well, I'm still--
Still not exactly clear

36:40.321 --> 36:42.421
on what it is you expect
from us in return.

36:42.456 --> 36:44.290
Well, you have sterling reviews

36:44.325 --> 36:46.125
from the
"American Medical Journal."

36:46.160 --> 36:49.562
I wouldn't mind a little of what
you have rubbing off on me.

36:49.596 --> 36:53.432
So I'd like to feature you and
Dr. Masters in the magazine.

36:53.467 --> 36:54.967
I'd like to get your names

36:55.001 --> 36:57.403
on the quarterly report
of my foundation.

36:57.437 --> 37:00.138
Changing the world
can be a lonely business.

37:00.173 --> 37:01.640
Why not do it together?

37:04.010 --> 37:07.679
Why not, indeed.

37:09.615 --> 37:10.815
Dallas.

37:10.850 --> 37:14.186
Sorry.
The capital of Texas is Austin.

37:14.220 --> 37:15.954
No, you're wrong.

37:17.723 --> 37:19.091
I will drink anyway,

37:19.125 --> 37:21.493
but only because
I'm a good sport.

37:23.462 --> 37:27.198
Mmm!

37:27.232 --> 37:29.267
- Alaska.
- Juneau.

37:34.139 --> 37:35.273
Oh!

37:35.307 --> 37:37.841
I-- I feel like
I'm drinking by myself.

37:37.876 --> 37:40.344
Well, you sort of are.

37:41.780 --> 37:43.647
How do you remember all those?

37:43.681 --> 37:45.716
My dad traveled
when I was a kid.

37:50.588 --> 37:53.391
I...
I used to tell him how...

37:53.425 --> 37:57.160
I hated how I never knew
where he was.

37:57.194 --> 38:00.431
And so he put a map on my wall.

38:00.465 --> 38:03.567
And ever time he'd go on tour,

38:03.601 --> 38:08.238
he'd put pins in the places
he was going.

38:21.152 --> 38:23.954
Um...
the thing is...

38:23.988 --> 38:29.992
I haven't done a lot with girls.

38:30.026 --> 38:32.628
You probably know a lot more
about this stuff.

38:32.663 --> 38:34.564
So I know more.

38:34.598 --> 38:38.568
Well...
Would you teach me?

38:38.602 --> 38:42.104
You know, show me what to do?

39:04.259 --> 39:08.229
Only that thing
that we shouldn't do.

39:08.263 --> 39:10.764
What do you mean?
Why not?

39:13.735 --> 39:15.436
It-- it's that time
of the month.

39:15.471 --> 39:18.438
Where?
You don't seem to be...

39:18.473 --> 39:22.642
Oh, when a girl
can get really pregnant.

39:22.676 --> 39:24.378
And you don't have a rubber.

39:26.580 --> 39:29.782
Next time.
We'll plan ahead.

39:38.958 --> 39:41.927
Well, you can't just
leave me like this.

39:43.997 --> 39:46.231
I mean, you have to do
something.

39:46.265 --> 39:49.001
Oh.

39:51.905 --> 39:54.606
No.
Not with your hand.

39:54.641 --> 39:57.375
Try that other thing.

39:57.410 --> 40:00.611
You know, what girls do
with their mouth.

40:00.646 --> 40:03.881
I-- I don't...
I don't want to do that.

40:03.916 --> 40:06.651
Why not?
You said that you know.

40:06.685 --> 40:09.187
I-- I don't know.

40:09.221 --> 40:10.655
It's in your mom's book.

40:10.689 --> 40:13.357
Jesus, don't be such
a prick tease.

40:14.927 --> 40:18.228
Come on.
With your mouth.

40:21.700 --> 40:23.935
No, no, no!

40:23.969 --> 40:28.638
Oh!

40:38.649 --> 40:42.919
Sorry.
Did I pull your hair?

41:39.542 --> 41:41.876
Barton!
I see you brought a guest.

41:41.910 --> 41:44.012
Well, Bill had a craving
for rubber chicken.

41:44.046 --> 41:45.747
I said I know just the shindig.

41:45.781 --> 41:47.949
I'm glad to run into you, Doug.

41:47.983 --> 41:49.851
There's an opportunity
I'd like to discuss.

41:49.885 --> 41:50.985
Yes, Dean Snyder

41:51.020 --> 41:52.654
mentioned you stopped
by the campus.

41:54.723 --> 41:57.659
Wash U has the chance
to be one of the first schools

41:57.693 --> 42:00.128
in the country to offer
a stand-alone course--

42:00.162 --> 42:01.796
Using your book
as the textbook.

42:01.830 --> 42:06.834
Yes. I could send a copy
on over to you, if you'd like--

42:06.869 --> 42:09.069
No, no need, Bill.
I read your book.

42:09.103 --> 42:13.374
You have?
What do you think?

42:15.510 --> 42:17.478
Would you get me
a gin and tonic, Barton?

42:17.512 --> 42:19.313
What are you drinking, Bill?

42:19.347 --> 42:20.648
I'm fine, thanks.

42:20.682 --> 42:22.949
Beefeater and plenty of ice.

42:29.190 --> 42:31.558
It's quite an achievement,
your book.

42:31.592 --> 42:33.359
Although it's still about sex,

42:33.394 --> 42:36.730
it's still graphic,
still controversial.

42:36.764 --> 42:41.301
You behaved badly, Bill,
in my hospital.

42:41.335 --> 42:43.203
You lied to your superiors,

42:43.237 --> 42:46.206
you abused your authority,
embarrassed me.

42:46.240 --> 42:49.175
God knows you pulled the wool
over Barton's eyes

42:49.210 --> 42:50.276
all these years.

42:50.311 --> 42:51.578
And Barton is a fine doctor,

42:51.612 --> 42:53.746
but he has a tendency
to show poor judgment--

42:53.780 --> 42:56.583
And not just
in his professional life.

42:56.617 --> 42:58.317
You try to ignore gossip,

42:58.351 --> 43:01.787
but when you hear the same rumor
year after year...

43:01.822 --> 43:03.422
Obviously,
Barton did the right thing,

43:03.456 --> 43:04.724
walking away
from the provost job.

43:04.758 --> 43:07.226
Don't kid yourself.

43:07.260 --> 43:10.029
He fought tooth and nail
to hold onto that position.

43:10.063 --> 43:12.732
And, frankly, that queer
is lucky to have a place

43:12.766 --> 43:14.099
in the university at all.

43:14.133 --> 43:18.002
Jesus, you are still
a smug, small-minded bureaucrat.

43:20.373 --> 43:23.408
I'm smart enough
to know when something's rotten.

43:23.443 --> 43:26.111
Barton Scully
with his disturbing rumors,

43:26.145 --> 43:28.280
Bill Masters
with his smutty book.

43:28.314 --> 43:31.649
Well, at least I've been able
to rid Washington University

43:31.683 --> 43:32.617
of one of you.

43:32.651 --> 43:34.318
They're out of beefeater,

43:34.353 --> 43:35.586
so I got Plymouth instead.

43:40.760 --> 43:43.394
Another gin and tonic, please.

43:50.101 --> 43:51.502
For heaven's sake, Bill,

43:51.536 --> 43:53.337
you're the one asking a favor
from Fitzhugh,

43:53.372 --> 43:55.072
then you spit
in the man's face?!

43:55.106 --> 43:56.240
I mean, how many times

43:56.275 --> 43:58.609
are we gonna have the chancellor
show us the door?

43:58.644 --> 44:00.177
What the hell's
the matter with you?!

44:00.211 --> 44:01.512
What's the matter with me?

44:01.546 --> 44:03.680
I'm not the one who's fetching
drinks for Doug Fitzhugh

44:03.714 --> 44:04.915
like some goddamn serving boy!

44:16.895 --> 44:19.529
You know what you need to do?
You need to come work for me.

44:19.563 --> 44:21.698
I mean it.

44:21.732 --> 44:24.334
I need someone to manage
my fertility practice,

44:24.368 --> 44:27.671
my OB patients, even perhaps
bring some patients of his own.

44:27.705 --> 44:31.140
That's... that's what
we need to do, together.

44:31.175 --> 44:35.645
I'm flattered, Bill.
But I'm happy where I am.

44:35.680 --> 44:37.146
But you shouldn't be.
He--

44:39.950 --> 44:42.118
They do not
appreciate you there.

44:42.152 --> 44:44.821
I don't think that's true.

44:44.855 --> 44:47.323
They listen to rumors.

44:51.862 --> 44:54.029
I really do need
to be getting home.

44:54.063 --> 44:56.932
To Judith?

45:05.542 --> 45:08.577
You...
you must wonder...

45:08.611 --> 45:10.611
what on earth--

45:10.646 --> 45:12.914
This is why you need to
come work for me, because...

45:12.949 --> 45:17.685
I do not wonder about Judith,
about any of it.

45:17.720 --> 45:20.755
I know.

45:20.789 --> 45:23.191
And it doesn't matter to me.

45:23.226 --> 45:27.194
Come where you're wanted,
Barton.

45:27.229 --> 45:30.798
Where you're respected.

45:36.605 --> 45:38.939
Tessie, I wasn't that late.

45:38.974 --> 45:42.343
My meeting just went on and on.

45:49.584 --> 45:51.986
Well, did you at least
have a good time?

45:52.020 --> 45:53.720
Did you meet any nice boys?

45:53.755 --> 45:56.523
I was the last one
waiting tonight.

45:56.557 --> 45:58.359
So was what you were doing
so important

45:58.393 --> 46:00.193
that you had to embarrass me
like that?

46:00.227 --> 46:04.698
Tessie, that's not--

46:06.634 --> 46:10.203
I am so sorry.

46:10.237 --> 46:12.773
I really am.

46:22.783 --> 46:25.118
Still sleeping in the doghouse?

46:25.152 --> 46:29.055
Uh, only
for the foreseeable future.

46:29.089 --> 46:31.291
Tell me that's not
all hate mail.

46:31.325 --> 46:34.359
It's all hate mail,
but then this morning,

46:34.394 --> 46:36.228
I got curious, opened one up,

46:36.262 --> 46:38.864
it was a Lutheran pastor
from Minnesota

46:38.899 --> 46:42.701
asking for advice on how to talk
to his congregants about sex.

46:42.736 --> 46:46.739
Who knows how many like that
are just sitting there,

46:46.773 --> 46:48.307
waiting to be read.

46:48.341 --> 46:50.375
Don't look at me,
I'm really busy.

46:52.912 --> 46:54.779
With work and kids
and the she-wolf,

46:54.814 --> 46:56.614
I don't have time
to sort laundry,

46:56.649 --> 46:58.383
much less read 300 letters
a day.

46:58.418 --> 47:00.585
Let me tell you
something about your wife.

47:00.619 --> 47:02.988
She's not a she-wolf.
She's bored-- out of her skull.

47:03.022 --> 47:05.256
She's too smart
to be scraping applesauce

47:05.290 --> 47:06.691
and wiping snot all day.

47:09.495 --> 47:10.829
The crazy, she should throw out,

47:10.863 --> 47:12.497
the good ones,
she should write back.

47:12.531 --> 47:14.532
We'll pay her 5 bucks a bag.

47:29.647 --> 47:31.582
Hey, Tessa.

47:39.724 --> 47:45.161
Sorry about the schnapps.
Don't feel bad.

47:45.196 --> 47:47.698
The same thing happened
to me a couple weeks ago.

47:47.732 --> 47:50.367
I threw up
all over my cousin's dog.

47:52.937 --> 47:57.040
Anyway, I had a really
great time with you.

47:57.074 --> 47:58.841
We should do it again.

48:01.345 --> 48:04.514
I'd love to.

48:17.260 --> 48:19.829
We were prepared
to recommend Dan Logan,

48:19.863 --> 48:21.130
the perfume manufacturer.

48:21.164 --> 48:22.532
Flavors and fragrances.

48:22.566 --> 48:24.333
Flavors
and fragrances manufacturer.

48:24.367 --> 48:25.768
But that was before we met Hef.

48:25.802 --> 48:28.837
Turns out Hugh Hefner comes
with a built-in audience--

48:28.871 --> 48:30.305
Four million subscribers.

48:30.340 --> 48:32.508
Not to mention a ton of cash.

48:32.542 --> 48:35.010
I would like to take
Mr. Hefner's name

48:35.045 --> 48:36.245
out of consideration.

48:36.279 --> 48:38.180
What?
Bill, we just told you--

48:38.214 --> 48:40.049
Hugh Hefner stands
for everything

48:40.083 --> 48:41.750
that we're trying
to get away from.

48:41.784 --> 48:43.752
- Sex?
- Titillation.

48:43.786 --> 48:45.720
He believes
in the work that we are doing.

48:45.755 --> 48:47.121
He's using us

48:47.156 --> 48:49.591
because we're the "good
housekeeping" seal of approval.

48:49.625 --> 48:52.427
Once he has our names
in his magazine, suddenly,

48:52.461 --> 48:54.729
he's not just peddling
girlie photos,

48:54.764 --> 48:56.364
he's a high-minded academic.

48:56.398 --> 48:57.799
But where does that leave us

48:57.833 --> 49:00.168
when we're squeezed in between
Miss July and Miss August?

49:00.202 --> 49:01.835
We've killed ourselves
to convince

49:01.870 --> 49:04.572
the medical establishment that
what we are doing is legitimate.

49:04.606 --> 49:05.940
And they are convinced.

49:05.974 --> 49:07.542
We couldn't have more
glowing reviews.

49:07.576 --> 49:09.177
It's not enough.

49:09.211 --> 49:12.746
Hugh Hefner
is the obvious choice, Bill.

49:12.781 --> 49:15.649
Nobody else even comes close.

49:17.351 --> 49:20.320
Why do people kiss?

49:20.354 --> 49:23.323
How did that start?
It's baffling, isn't it?

49:23.357 --> 49:26.594
How does putting your lips
on someone else's lips

49:26.628 --> 49:29.262
serve any evolutionary purpose
at all?

49:29.297 --> 49:30.998
Smell.

49:31.032 --> 49:34.834
Lips, tongue-- incidental.
It's all background noise.

49:34.868 --> 49:37.404
It's what's happening
right here.

49:37.438 --> 49:39.972
Smell tells us
everything we need to know.

49:40.006 --> 49:41.840
We can smell if someone is sick.

49:41.874 --> 49:43.642
It's not a good idea.

49:43.676 --> 49:47.313
We can smell if a woman is
ovulating-- very good idea.

49:47.347 --> 49:50.216
We can smell fear.
We can smell revulsion.

49:50.250 --> 49:53.385
We can smell... desire.

49:53.420 --> 49:58.023
Now, this perfume
does not smell like desire.

49:58.057 --> 49:59.190
Mnh-mnh.

49:59.225 --> 50:02.027
It smells like
a bouquet of fresh flowers,

50:02.061 --> 50:05.831
which is telling us what,
exactly?

50:05.865 --> 50:08.500
The only thing
this perfume is telling us

50:08.534 --> 50:10.002
is that it smells nice.

50:10.036 --> 50:13.605
I'm not very interested in nice.

50:13.639 --> 50:16.774
I'm interested in a fragrance
that says "I want you.

50:16.808 --> 50:19.644
Go to bed with me,
you can't live without me."

50:24.550 --> 50:28.386
Well, uh, smell
is one of the disciplines

50:28.420 --> 50:31.255
we're hoping to explore in
the next phase of our research.

50:31.289 --> 50:34.558
That's why when we began
discussing a potential investor,

50:34.592 --> 50:36.861
Mrs. Johnson and I
immediately agreed

50:36.895 --> 50:39.196
that you were the right
man for the job.

50:39.230 --> 50:41.065
If you'll excuse me,

50:41.099 --> 50:44.268
I will get started
on the paperwork.

50:51.643 --> 50:55.345
What's the story?
Married, single?

50:55.380 --> 50:57.814
Mrs. Johnson?

50:57.848 --> 50:59.316
Mm-hmm.

50:59.350 --> 51:02.152
Is uh, married, yes.

51:21.572 --> 51:23.972
Is it
interesting reading at least?

51:24.007 --> 51:27.042
I have plenty to do,
Lester, I don't need a hobby.

51:27.077 --> 51:30.045
$5.00 a bag isn't a hobby.

51:30.080 --> 51:33.148
I got paid $35 to be a banana

51:33.183 --> 51:35.584
in that Chiquita commercial.

51:35.618 --> 51:37.352
Granted,
that was a long time ago,

51:37.386 --> 51:38.721
and I had to wear that suit.

51:47.296 --> 51:50.699
Look...
Answering the hate mail

51:50.734 --> 51:53.668
is not the most lucrative job
in the world,

51:53.703 --> 51:56.804
but let's face it,
you sitting at home all day

51:56.839 --> 52:01.543
with our sweet but screaming
kids is never gonna work.

52:01.577 --> 52:03.978
You're too smart for that.

52:08.316 --> 52:10.151
And who knows?

52:10.185 --> 52:14.655
Maybe you'll find someone
who's more confused than we are.

52:15.858 --> 52:19.326
I think I already did.

52:21.496 --> 52:24.732
Debbie from Des Plaines.

52:24.766 --> 52:29.002
"Dear Dr. Masters
and Mrs. Jonathan."

52:29.036 --> 52:31.572
You have to admit,
that's a pretty promising start.

52:34.075 --> 52:36.477
"I cannot stop thinking about
the wickedness of your book.

52:36.511 --> 52:40.080
The pictures come into my head,
and they will not leave me--

52:40.114 --> 52:42.448
Men and women
in all their nakedness.

52:42.483 --> 52:50.223
Hands reaching, groping,
skin quivering with lust,

52:50.258 --> 52:52.192
yearning to be touched.

52:52.226 --> 52:55.128
A whispering so close
to your ear

52:55.163 --> 52:59.231
that you can feel the hot breath
tingle down your spine--"

53:05.339 --> 53:07.139
This does not mean
that I forgive you.

53:07.174 --> 53:09.676
I didn't ask you to forgive me.

53:09.710 --> 53:11.577
Well, I don't.

53:11.612 --> 53:13.746
Well, then, good.

53:37.970 --> 53:39.003
Hello?!

53:41.140 --> 53:44.376
Joy?

53:46.145 --> 53:47.278
Joy?

53:49.849 --> 53:51.615
Hello?

53:51.650 --> 53:53.384
Paul.

53:53.418 --> 53:56.254
Sorry, your car is running.

53:56.288 --> 54:00.458
Oh, thank you, I...
I didn't realize.

54:00.492 --> 54:02.327
Is everything all right?

54:02.361 --> 54:05.062
Oh, it's, uh, it's...
it's Joy.

54:05.096 --> 54:09.266
She... she collapsed.

54:09.300 --> 54:15.272
And I took her in, and they're
calling it a brain aneurysm.

54:15.306 --> 54:17.641
Uh...

54:17.676 --> 54:18.942
Where is she now?

54:18.977 --> 54:20.344
She's at the ICU,

54:20.378 --> 54:23.613
and she's gonna be there
for a while.

54:23.647 --> 54:26.149
She's gonna be all right?

54:26.184 --> 54:30.020
Well, the extent
of the brain damage,

54:30.054 --> 54:32.489
the doctor said,
isn't clear yet.

54:32.523 --> 54:36.393
But it's, um, uh...

54:36.427 --> 54:40.997
"Catastrophic" was the word
they kept using.

54:41.031 --> 54:45.334
She's going to make it, the
doctor said, is the good news.

54:45.369 --> 54:49.406
That's...
That's the good news.

54:49.440 --> 54:50.673
I'm sorry.

55:07.757 --> 55:11.326
Who goes somewhere
where they're not wanted?

55:14.464 --> 55:17.866
You're wanted.

55:17.901 --> 55:19.701
Here.

55:35.818 --> 55:39.921
I'll be right back.

55:52.835 --> 55:54.836
No, no, no, stay, stay.

56:12.720 --> 56:14.955
She'll go back to sleep
in a minute.
