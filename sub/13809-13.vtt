ABOUT SURFING.

A FEW LESSONS?

04:23.429 --> 04:24.847
YOU KNOW, LIKE IN PRIVATE?

04:24.931 --> 04:26.557

BUT HE'S GOT A BALANCE PROBLEM.

04:26.641 --> 04:28.685
AHA!

WELCOME TO TITO'S
SCHOOL OF SURFING.

04:50.164 --> 04:51.916
NOT AFFILIATED
WITH TITO'S SURFING SCHOOL.

OF THE SURFBOARD

04:54.002 --> 04:58.256
IS GOING TO CHECK YOU OUT.

04:58.339 --> 05:00.675
I DON'T THINK THIS IS
SUCH A GOOD IDEA.

05:00.758 --> 05:03.011
SAMMY, YOU MUST NOT
CONCERN YOURSELF.

05:03.094 --> 05:04.012
EVERYTHING SAID
BETWEEN US

05:04.095 --> 05:07.056

CONFIDENTIAL.

05:07.140 --> 05:07.890
REALLY?

05:07.974 --> 05:08.766
OF COURSE.

05:08.850 --> 05:11.686
WHY, JUST LAST WEEK,
MERV STIMPLETON TOLD ME

05:11.769 --> 05:13.354
HE WAS AFRAID
OF SAND CRABS--

05:13.438 --> 05:16.065
LITTLE, TINY SAND CRABS.

05:16.149 --> 05:18.776
AND THAT IS A CONFIDENCE
I'LL NEVER BETRAY.

05:18.860 --> 05:20.945
TITO, WE KNOW THAT.

05:21.029 --> 05:22.905
YOU MENTIONED IT
AT THE TOWN MEETING

05:22.989 --> 05:24.282
TWO DAYS AGO.

05:24.365 --> 05:26.743
{\an1}NOW, WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM,
LITTLE BROTHER?

05:26.826 --> 05:29.287
I CAN TELL YOU
IN TWO WORDS: SUR FING.

05:29.370 --> 05:34.334
{\an1}OH, AS THE ANCIENT HAWAIIANS
SAID,<i> HE'E NALU.</i>

05:48.848 --> 05:49.766
{\an5}OH!

05:48.848 --> 05:49.766
OH!

05:49.849 --> 05:53.352
THE HISTORY OF SURFING
IS A FASCINATING ONE.

05:53.436 --> 05:56.189
IT STARTED
HUNDREDS OF YEARS AGO.

05:58.858 --> 05:59.484
YOWEE!

06:07.575 --> 06:09.911
{\an5}Tito:

<i>BE ALMOST 20 FEET LONG</i>

06:24.300 --> 06:26.844

<i>MADE OF PLYWOOD.</i>

06:34.393 --> 06:35.978

<i>IN A DISPLAY OF UNNATURAL ACTS,</i>
<i>BOTH ON SEA AND AIR.</i>

06:48.074 --> 06:52.620
AND SO, THIS IS WHY WE SURF:

06:52.703 --> 06:57.208
TO CELEBRATE A TRADITION
OF COMMUNING WITH THE WATER.

06:57.291 --> 06:59.752
AND TO HAVE AS MUCH FUN
AS HUMANLY POSSIBLE.

{\an1}RELAX AND HAVE
A KILLER TIME, LITTLE COZ!

07:13.933 --> 07:15.726
THAT'S WHAT REGGIE
KEEPS TELLING ME.

07:15.810 --> 07:18.020
NONE OF YOU GUYS KNOW
HOW HARD IT IS FOR ME

07:18.104 --> 07:19.814
{\an1}TO JUST BALANCE
ON THE BOARD.

07:19.897 --> 07:22.024
YOU JUST NEED
TO PRACTICE.

07:24.777 --> 07:27.029
(<i> grunting</i> )

07:27.113 --> 07:28.197
BALANCE?

07:28.281 --> 07:32.034
OKAY, NOW PADDLE...

07:32.118 --> 07:33.619
WHAT'S THE MATTER, TITO?

07:33.703 --> 07:34.412
HMM...

07:34.495 --> 07:36.873
I'VE BEEN DOING THIS
A MILLION TIMES.

07:36.956 --> 07:38.624
WHAT'S WRONG?

07:38.708 --> 07:40.585
HMM...

07:40.668 --> 07:42.253
IT'S ME, ISN'T IT?

07:42.336 --> 07:44.797
I DON'T KNOW WHY
I DIDN'T SEE IT.

07:44.881 --> 07:45.590
THE ANSWER IS OBVIOUS!

07:47.508 --> 07:51.762
{\an1}WHEN I SEE YOU IN THE WATER,
I SEE SOMEONE ELSE.

07:51.846 --> 07:52.722
HUH?

07:52.805 --> 07:54.891
I SEE MYSELF.

07:54.974 --> 07:56.434
{\an1}SAMMY, WHEN I WAS
A BOY IN HAWAII

07:56.517 --> 08:00.396
<i>I HAD TROUBLE SITTING</i>
<i>ON THE BOARD, TOO.</i>

08:01.898 --> 08:07.904
(<i> other kids laughing</i> )

08:07.987 --> 08:10.531
WHY DON'T YOU JUST GIVE UP,

08:10.615 --> 08:12.158
Tito:
<i>BUT I DIDN'T GIVE UP.</i>

08:12.241 --> 08:14.744
<i>I PRACTICED AND PRACTICED</i>
<i>UNTIL ONE DAY</i>

08:14.827 --> 08:17.455
<i>MY FATHER FIGURED OUT</i>
<i>WHAT THE PROBLEM WAS.</i>

08:20.333 --> 08:22.168

08:30.301 --> 08:33.179
WOW, YOU WERE LIKE ME.

08:33.261 --> 08:37.265
{\an1}AND BACK THEN, SAMMY, I WAS NOT
SO LITTLE AROUND THE MIDDLE.

08:37.350 --> 08:37.933
{\an1}BIG FELLAS
NEED BIG BOARDS.

08:38.017 --> 08:40.227
THAT MAKES
PERFECT SENSE.

08:40.311 --> 08:43.356
YOU DON'T NEED
AN ORDINARY SURFBOARD.

08:43.438 --> 08:44.357
YOU NEED A LONGBOARD,

08:44.440 --> 08:47.944
{\an1}AND NOT AN ORDINARY
LONGBOARD... BUT THIS.

08:48.027 --> 08:50.780

{\an1}IT IS ON THIS BOARD
THAT I LEARNED HOW TO SURF

08:54.033 --> 08:55.243
WHEN I WAS A BOY.

08:55.326 --> 08:56.285
IT SERVED ME WELL.

08:56.369 --> 08:58.246
AND IT WILL SERVE YOU WELL.

ME?

08:59.163 --> 09:01.082
YOU'RE GIVING
THIS TO ME?

09:01.165 --> 09:01.749
BUT TO BE WORTHY

09:01.832 --> 09:04.043
{\an1}YOU MUST NEVER
FORGET ONE THING

09:04.126 --> 09:05.628
THAT IS MOST IMPORTANT.

09:07.171 --> 09:08.798
{\an1}YOU GOT TO HAVE FUN,

09:47.878 --> 09:48.379
YOU READY, SAM?

09:48.462 --> 09:50.256
I'M READY

09:50.339 --> 09:53.092
IF THAT'S

10:32.882 --> 10:34.091
I'M REALLY DOING IT!

10:47.146 --> 10:48.189
I DID IT!

10:48.272 --> 10:50.024
I RODE MY FIRST WAVE!

10:50.107 --> 10:52.234
YOU WERE GREAT!

10:52.318 --> 10:54.862
{\an5}YOU DID OUR BOARD PROUD,

10:54.945 --> 10:56.155

11:01.911 --> 11:02.870
UH... UH...

11:05.373 --> 11:06.290
ALL RIGHT!

11:06.374 --> 11:07.249
I GOT TO TRY THAT ONE.

11:07.333 --> 11:10.336
{\an1}HEY, BEAUTY WAVE

11:11.629 --> 11:14.215

SAMMY!

11:14.298 --> 11:15.091
{\an1}I DIDN'T THINK
YOU HAD IT IN YOU

11:15.174 --> 11:17.176
BUT MAN, WAS I WRONG!

11:17.259 --> 11:19.136
YOU'RE REALLY A SURFER NOW.

11:19.220 --> 11:22.139
YOU WERE TRULY UNSQUIDLY, DUDE!

11:22.223 --> 11:24.183
{\an1}THANKS, BUT IT'LL
BE A LONG TIME

11:24.266 --> 11:25.226
{\an1}BEFORE I'M
AS GOOD AS YOU GUYS.

11:25.309 --> 11:27.812
AS THE OLD SAYING GOES

11:27.895 --> 11:30.523
THE BEST SURFER IS THE ONE
THAT'S HAVING THE MOST FUN

11:30.606 --> 11:32.733
AND TODAY, SAM, THAT'S YOU.
