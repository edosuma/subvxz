00:36.150 --> 00:37.947
Candy Party!

00:38.204 --> 00:41.127
Jake! This party is <i>so</i> crazy!

00:41.244 --> 00:42.962
I know, Finn! I know!

00:43.885 --> 00:45.971
So, Finn... Do you have a girlfriend?

00:46.033 --> 00:48.744
Oh, my gosh!
I can't believe you just said that.

00:51.299 --> 00:54.142
What a wonderful, marvelous party!

00:54.190 --> 00:55.736
Ok. I'm gonna do it.

00:55.759 --> 00:56.744
Ok-ok-ok.

00:56.776 --> 00:58.580
Everyone watch! I'm gonna do a flip!

01:11.352 --> 01:13.141
Princess Bubblegum's in trouble!

01:14.516 --> 01:16.086
Watch where you're going!

01:25.356 --> 01:28.208
Please! Calm yourselves, my people.

01:28.247 --> 01:29.966
I am safe!

01:30.114 --> 01:34.536
Oh, thank you, Finn.
You truly are my hero this day.

01:34.567 --> 01:35.278
Cool.

01:35.684 --> 01:37.958
Hero... Hmmm...

01:38.356 --> 01:40.012
Hero...

01:40.637 --> 01:42.262
Hey, I just thought of something!

01:42.309 --> 01:43.582
Uhh... What'd you think of?

01:43.621 --> 01:46.996
I'll show you. Come on!
We'll go through my secret entrance.

01:47.082 --> 01:49.059
Alright, everyone. Turn around.

01:50.683 --> 01:53.714
Well, turn around.
This entrance is <i>secret. </i>

01:56.878 --> 01:59.042
Math. Hurry, Finn!

01:59.831 --> 02:00.738
No way!

02:02.503 --> 02:04.331
Here it is. Check it out.

02:04.417 --> 02:05.807
A magical globe?

02:05.831 --> 02:08.714
No, Finn. It's what you can
see <i> through</i> the globe.

02:08.830 --> 02:09.612
Golly!

02:10.508 --> 02:12.425
Look. See this book?

02:12.455 --> 02:13.549
Yeah, I see it!

02:13.604 --> 02:16.182
It's called the Enchiridion.

02:16.213 --> 02:20.611
It's a book meant only for heroes
who's hearts are righteous.

02:21.822 --> 02:22.838
Shmow-zow!

02:22.845 --> 02:27.338
The book lies at the top of Mount Cragdor,
guarded by a manly minotaur.

02:27.345 --> 02:31.111
It's waiting for a truly
righteous hero to claim it!

02:31.134 --> 02:34.626
Do you think I've got the goods, Bubblegum?
'Cause I am <i>in to this stuff! </i>

02:34.657 --> 02:35.728
Yeah, I know...

02:35.736 --> 02:37.228
And yes, I do.

02:37.251 --> 02:38.829
Then off I go!

02:39.001 --> 02:41.110
Jaaaaaaake!

02:41.856 --> 02:42.848
Thanks, pal.

02:42.856 --> 02:44.130
Farewell, Fi-

02:44.145 --> 02:45.419
Oh, wait a minute...

02:45.590 --> 02:48.208
Farewell, Finn the human boy!

02:48.239 --> 02:49.184
Bye, Princess!

02:49.379 --> 02:50.966
You know what time it is, buddy?

02:50.989 --> 02:53.059
Adventure time?

02:53.091 --> 02:54.137
Yeah, man!

03:01.286 --> 03:03.005
Greetings, young heroes to be.

03:03.021 --> 03:05.732
This mountain is called Cragdor.
Its purpose is two-fold:

03:05.740 --> 03:09.200
to protect the Enchiridion and to test the
hearts of those who seek to possess it.

03:09.217 --> 03:10.842
Many noble challengers have
entered the temple

03:10.849 --> 03:12.999
to pass the grueling trials that
lie behind these walls,

03:13.013 --> 03:15.177
but no one has ever left here
alive <i>or</i> dead!

03:15.201 --> 03:18.263
Only the truest most worthy hero can
receive the heroes' Enchiridion

03:18.279 --> 03:19.576
and walk out these doors again!

03:19.815 --> 03:20.998
If it is you, friend,

03:21.357 --> 03:22.864
and I cannot say that I am certain,

03:22.865 --> 03:24.717
but you are verily welcome to try;

03:24.732 --> 03:27.295
however, first you must pass my riddle.

03:27.537 --> 03:29.404
My name is Key-per,

03:29.428 --> 03:31.560
and duly so, for I carry the key
to this door,

03:31.576 --> 03:33.998
but all is not how it appears, you see.
(Or perhaps you do not see at all)

03:34.435 --> 03:36.451
<i>Perhaps</i> the key is in you, child,

03:36.529 --> 03:38.318
but you cannot use your brawn here.

03:38.381 --> 03:40.834
The door is magically sealed.

03:41.637 --> 03:44.113
Oh! You've unlocked the riddle of the door.

03:44.387 --> 03:45.879
Brilliantly done, child!

03:46.941 --> 03:50.457
Please, reveal to me how
you unraveled my clue.

03:50.511 --> 03:52.464
I just thought you'd look
cute stuffed in that lock.

03:52.496 --> 03:53.871
Oh, yes.

03:53.902 --> 03:56.418
That's how most people get in.

03:56.441 --> 03:57.160
Bye!

03:57.371 --> 04:01.246
You've passed the first trial,
young heroes, but prepare yourselves!

04:01.277 --> 04:04.293
For there are many trials ahead of you,

04:04.316 --> 04:09.605
and each trial is more
treacherous than the last.

04:12.377 --> 04:13.901
Enchiridion is...

04:15.424 --> 04:15.987
That way.

04:16.002 --> 04:16.673
What?!?

04:16.704 --> 04:19.642
Dude! You can't smell the book from <i>here!</i>

04:19.658 --> 04:21.533
It's in the castle on top of the mountain.

04:22.260 --> 04:23.025
In a room.

04:23.721 --> 04:24.869
Wish you had one, huh?

04:25.423 --> 04:26.423
Help! Help!

04:26.455 --> 04:27.088
This way!

04:27.104 --> 04:28.112
What about the book?

04:28.252 --> 04:30.635
It can wait. Someone needs our help.

04:32.284 --> 04:33.721
Yo, Finn. Are you alright?

04:33.822 --> 04:35.166
Did you get brain damage?

04:35.213 --> 04:36.885
I'm fine! Keep going!

04:36.908 --> 04:37.783
We have to hurry!

04:40.663 --> 04:41.600
I gotcha.

04:42.423 --> 04:44.196
Thank you for saving us...

04:44.305 --> 04:47.274
<i>Now</i> we can destroy this old lady!

04:49.453 --> 04:50.102
What?!?

04:51.203 --> 04:53.375
Every time you say "what"
we'll destroy and old lady.

04:53.429 --> 04:53.929
What?!?

04:56.424 --> 04:58.432
Every time you say "no"
we'll destroy an old lady.

04:58.487 --> 04:59.346
No! Wai...

05:00.399 --> 05:01.133
Please...

05:01.313 --> 05:01.953
Don't destroy...

05:02.656 --> 05:03.156
Anymore...

05:03.797 --> 05:04.500
...Old women.

05:04.625 --> 05:07.859
Every time you look sad
we'll destroy a <i>big</i> old woman!

05:07.883 --> 05:09.813
Well... Ever since I got the...

05:12.453 --> 05:16.297
Hey, guys. Every time he's a big wuss,
let's destroy and old lady.

05:18.531 --> 05:19.984
Hey! Back off, you gnomes!

05:20.008 --> 05:21.828
That kid just saved you guys!

05:21.844 --> 05:25.179
You should thank him,
not destroy old ladies!

05:25.258 --> 05:27.234
Do you even know what I'm talking about?

05:27.578 --> 05:28.821
Say thank you!

05:29.453 --> 05:30.765
Say...

05:30.781 --> 05:31.500
Thank...

05:31.508 --> 05:32.492
You...

05:32.524 --> 05:33.516
Kill it!

05:35.663 --> 05:36.992
Get back in there!

05:37.336 --> 05:39.069
Help! Help!

05:39.539 --> 05:41.305
Hey, Finn. You ok?

05:41.499 --> 05:42.640
No way, dude.

05:42.758 --> 05:44.828
Those old ladies are destroyed
because of me.

05:45.086 --> 05:46.352
I'm not righteous...

05:46.406 --> 05:47.664
...I'm <i>wrongteous.</i>

05:47.711 --> 05:48.953
...Stupidteous...

05:50.219 --> 05:53.899
Awww. Don't let those gnomes
and their illusions get you down.

05:54.047 --> 05:55.836
They're just gnomes and illusions.

05:55.905 --> 05:56.843
Illusions?

05:56.875 --> 05:57.610
Yeah, man.

05:57.640 --> 05:58.344
Think.

05:58.360 --> 06:00.039
What would regular, old, sweet ladies

06:00.065 --> 06:02.478
be doing wandering the hills of
Mount Cragdor?

06:02.581 --> 06:03.713
Maybe they're lost?

06:04.956 --> 06:06.190
No way.

06:06.260 --> 06:08.659
This place is designed to mess you up;

06:08.698 --> 06:09.784
to mess with your head.

06:10.097 --> 06:11.307
None of this is real.

06:11.333 --> 06:14.075
It's all just trials to test your
heroic attributes.

06:17.378 --> 06:18.980
Now let's go get that book.

06:19.096 --> 06:21.635
Yeah! You're the smartest dog I know, man.

06:23.409 --> 06:25.502
Jake? Jaaaaaaaake!

06:25.556 --> 06:27.877
You cannot pass!

06:28.076 --> 06:29.686
Gimme back my friend!

06:29.717 --> 06:30.490
No!

06:30.521 --> 06:32.583
It's ok, Finn! I can get out!

06:32.935 --> 06:34.319
Let Jake go, or I'll...

06:35.248 --> 06:36.678
I'll kick your foot!

06:38.763 --> 06:42.154
It is impossible for <i>you</i> to hurt <i>me!</i>

06:42.920 --> 06:44.700
Don't worry, dude! I found another way...

06:46.075 --> 06:47.153
I'm coming, buddy!

06:49.575 --> 06:53.294
I think your dog finally fell
into my stomach.

06:53.466 --> 06:55.887
Hey... Where'd you go?

06:55.918 --> 06:57.911
I got your wallet, man!

06:58.972 --> 07:00.535
Hey! My big money!

07:00.543 --> 07:02.082
Give it back!

07:02.090 --> 07:03.778
Give me back my friend!

07:03.910 --> 07:05.988
But I killed him already!

07:06.988 --> 07:07.863
Fine...

07:07.925 --> 07:09.395
I'll give you your dollar.

07:09.644 --> 07:12.495
Here's your dollaaaaaarrrrr!!!

07:18.202 --> 07:18.991
Jake!

07:19.648 --> 07:20.601
You're ok!

07:20.664 --> 07:22.070
Stomachs are weird.

07:27.998 --> 07:30.749
Dude! You just flew us all
the way to the top!

07:30.842 --> 07:31.592
Wait a minute.

07:32.530 --> 07:34.553
I can smell the book right through
this door.

07:37.749 --> 07:40.897
You're under arrest for stealing my dollar!

07:42.225 --> 07:43.350
Just a minute Jake.

07:50.405 --> 07:51.663
You know what that was?

07:51.834 --> 07:52.999
<i>That</i> was righteous.

07:53.022 --> 07:53.858
Thanks, Jake.

07:53.952 --> 07:55.772
Now sniff out that book for me.

07:55.936 --> 07:56.788
You got it!

08:02.933 --> 08:04.113
Cool!

08:04.136 --> 08:08.050
Congratulations, Finn the human.

08:08.355 --> 08:13.480
You must be truly righteous
to have made it this far.

08:13.668 --> 08:14.449
Thank you.

08:14.496 --> 08:17.878
Now! Enter my brain-world,

08:17.902 --> 08:21.613
and I will show you some
aspect of yourself...

08:21.745 --> 08:26.675
...that you're not entirely aware of.

08:28.830 --> 08:30.619
Where... am I?

08:31.033 --> 08:33.173
For your final trial:

08:33.681 --> 08:35.275
slay the beast!

08:35.602 --> 08:37.392
Why? Is it an evil beast?

08:37.438 --> 08:40.977
Yes. It's completely evil.

08:41.001 --> 08:42.672
Will you slay it?

08:42.696 --> 08:45.259
Shoot, yeah. I'll slay
anything that's evil.

08:45.285 --> 08:46.182
That's my deal.

08:51.921 --> 08:56.820
Yes! You've done well, hero.

08:56.843 --> 08:57.187
Thank you.

08:57.202 --> 08:58.163
Now...

08:58.179 --> 09:02.897
As one last, <i>last</i>, trial...

09:03.491 --> 09:05.569
Slay this ant!

09:06.202 --> 09:06.944
Is it evil?

09:06.967 --> 09:10.717
No! But... it's not good either. It's...

09:11.303 --> 09:12.100
...neutral.

09:12.397 --> 09:13.475
Will you slay it?

09:15.217 --> 09:15.811
No!

09:15.842 --> 09:18.623
If you want the heroes' Enchiridion,

09:18.647 --> 09:22.201
then slay this unaligned ant!

09:22.256 --> 09:22.897
Never.

09:23.037 --> 09:24.022
Never.

09:24.240 --> 09:25.514
Never!!!

09:27.497 --> 09:29.911
Congratulations, Finn the human.

09:29.943 --> 09:31.583
Now you have truly reached...

09:31.607 --> 09:33.412
NEVER!!!

09:34.342 --> 09:36.028
Oh, no! Mr. Key-per!

09:36.052 --> 09:37.123
I-I'm sorry.

09:37.685 --> 09:39.997
Why are you wearing that
little devil costume?

09:40.115 --> 09:41.912
These are my pajamas.

09:41.935 --> 09:44.130
I was getting ready for bed.

09:44.193 --> 09:46.771
Finn... Jake... You made it!

09:46.818 --> 09:48.380
Are you another trial?

09:48.404 --> 09:49.833
Trial? Oh, no!

09:50.373 --> 09:52.740
I'm Mannish Man, the minotaur.

09:53.498 --> 09:56.161
The manly minotaur from
Princess Bubblegum's story!

09:59.398 --> 10:00.531
So...

10:00.617 --> 10:02.148
Can I check out the Enchiridion?

10:02.172 --> 10:03.359
Can I? Can I? Can I?

10:03.476 --> 10:05.625
Yeah. Come on. Let's go check it out.

10:06.773 --> 10:09.609
We've been watching you guys
on our magical viewing globe.

10:09.632 --> 10:11.483
Take a seat guys, have some juice.

10:11.506 --> 10:14.850
There's grape and apple and
the gatekeeper made spaghetti.

10:15.116 --> 10:16.718
And... Alright, Finn.

10:17.343 --> 10:18.632
Are you ready for this?

10:21.619 --> 10:23.236
The Enchiridion!

10:23.275 --> 10:24.650
You deserve it, Finn.

10:24.924 --> 10:25.689
Really?

10:25.721 --> 10:26.955
Yeah, Finn.

10:26.994 --> 10:30.408
You're the goodest of heart and
most righteous hero I've seen here.

10:30.510 --> 10:34.908
Tenderness, ingenuity, bravery,
nard-kicking ability,

10:35.041 --> 10:37.713
and when you took that
giant ogre's dollar...

10:38.986 --> 10:41.416
Oh, man! The Key-per nearly fainted!

10:42.197 --> 10:43.525
It's true!

10:46.736 --> 10:50.760
Hey! Crack open that book and read
something for fun's sake, alright?

10:51.361 --> 10:53.064
