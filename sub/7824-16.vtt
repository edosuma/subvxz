I'll make it, Mom.

This is Marge Simpson.

02:59.590 --> 03:01.300
Not that I'm angry

03:01.360 --> 03:04.130
but how did you get
my home number?

03:04.200 --> 03:07.100
I see. Quite ingenious.

03:07.170 --> 03:09.570
Doctor, I think Lisa
has the mumps.

03:09.640 --> 03:13.710
Mrs. Simpson, much as I'd like
to rely on your diagnosis

03:13.770 --> 03:17.240
I think it might be
professionally derelict
of me to do so.

03:17.310 --> 03:19.310
Let me check my schedule.

03:19.380 --> 03:21.420
2:00 is fine.

03:21.480 --> 03:22.720
Thank you, Dr. Hibbert.

03:22.780 --> 03:25.150
No way! She's faking!

03:25.220 --> 03:27.490
If Lisa stays home,
I stay home.

If Bart stays home,
I'm going to school.

03:29.760 --> 03:30.860
Fine. Then...

03:30.920 --> 03:33.120
Wait a minute.
If Lisa goes to school..

03:33.190 --> 03:34.400
then <i>I go to school.</i>

03:34.460 --> 03:35.630
But then Lisa stays home

03:35.690 --> 03:38.390
so I stay home...so
Lisa goes to school..

03:38.460 --> 03:40.330
Lisa, don't confuse
your brother like that.

03:40.400 --> 03:41.700
Have a nice day at school, Bart.

03:41.770 --> 03:44.010
Get my homework
from Mrs. Hoover.

03:44.070 --> 03:45.440

03:45.500 --> 03:48.000
Lisa, you wasted chicken pox.

your precious dog warden

04:50.570 --> 04:52.340
you old battle-ax

because <i>my dog
is tied up in the backyard.</i>

There's only one family
on this block--

04:57.780 --> 04:59.250
no, on Earth--

04:59.310 --> 05:02.580
inconsiderate enough to let
a monster like that roam free.

05:02.650 --> 05:04.220
D-ohhh!

05:04.280 --> 05:08.150
Are you losing your hearing,
or are you just stupid?

05:08.220 --> 05:11.090
I am going to explain this
to you one more time

05:11.160 --> 05:12.690
and then I'm going
to hang up on you.

05:12.760 --> 05:15.760
It is <i>not my dog!</i>

05:15.830 --> 05:20.970
I tied <i>my dog outside <i>myself!</i></i>

05:21.030 --> 05:23.030
I am looking at him right...

05:23.100 --> 05:23.970
D-ohhh!

05:28.170 --> 05:30.100
Well, howdly-do,
Simpson.

05:30.180 --> 05:30.950
Getting a little
exercise, huh?

05:31.010 --> 05:32.910
Good for you, pal.

05:32.980 --> 05:34.750
Oh, look at this old rascal.

05:34.810 --> 05:37.680
He's a wet old baby boy,
isn't he?

and vanity license plates.

06:02.910 --> 06:04.810
Well, they're not

Swelling of the parotids...

06:21.890 --> 06:23.020
I knew it.

06:23.100 --> 06:25.300
Looks like little Lisa
has the mumps.

06:25.360 --> 06:27.930
I guess you'll be missing
a week of school, young lady.

06:28.000 --> 06:30.470
Oh no. I don't want
to fall behind my class.

06:32.600 --> 06:36.630
Oh, such responsibility
for such a little girl.

06:36.710 --> 06:38.050
What's your
favorite subject?

06:38.110 --> 06:39.980
- Arithmetic.
- Oh ho, ho, ho...

06:40.050 --> 06:42.580
Arithmetic. Now before you know
it, you'll be back among

06:42.650 --> 06:48.060
your polygons, your hypotenuse
and your Euclidean algorithms.

06:48.120 --> 06:50.890
Now you get rest
and have yourself a wahwee pop.

Hi, Lisa.

06:55.230 --> 06:56.800
What's wrong?

06:56.860 --> 06:57.870
The mumps?

06:57.930 --> 06:59.900
Ooh, the kissing disease.

Oh yes, you do.

( <i>whimpering )</i>

19:46.930 --> 19:48.570
I'm sorry, boy.

19:48.630 --> 19:50.190
You can't help being dumb.

19:51.270 --> 19:53.170
What are you doing, dear?

19:53.240 --> 19:54.910
Sewing a new quilt.

19:54.970 --> 19:56.930
It's one thing
to be a link in a chain.

19:57.010 --> 19:58.680
It's another
to start one of your own.

19:58.740 --> 19:59.970
Aw..

20:00.040 --> 20:02.370
This patch commemorates

20:02.450 --> 20:04.950
the destruction
of the old quilt.

20:05.020 --> 20:09.790
Well, you certainly
captured the moment.
Mwah!

20:09.850 --> 20:11.280
Come on, boy.

20:11.360 --> 20:13.290
Sit.

20:13.360 --> 20:14.730
Sit... sit...

20:14.790 --> 20:17.420
Oh, come on, sit!

20:17.500 --> 20:18.800
Oh, man.

20:18.860 --> 20:21.160
Bart, he's not going
to learn it now.

20:21.230 --> 20:24.740
Don't spend your
last hours together
tormenting the poor creature.

20:24.800 --> 20:26.130
<i>Have some fun.</i>

20:26.200 --> 20:27.160
<i>Frolic with him.</i>

20:29.010 --> 20:31.010
Go get it, boy!

20:52.000 --> 20:53.630
I'm gonna miss you, boy.

20:53.700 --> 20:57.700
I thought we were going
to be pals forever.

20:57.770 --> 21:01.410
But we're going to
have to say good-bye

21:01.470 --> 21:04.800
because you don't understand
a single word I say.

21:04.880 --> 21:07.450
If you just knew
how important it was
to learn...

21:07.510 --> 21:08.820
blah blah sit.

21:10.550 --> 21:11.990
Wait, you did it.

21:13.920 --> 21:16.160
Blah blah blah
blah blah blah blah.

21:16.220 --> 21:17.320
Lay down.

21:18.720 --> 21:19.950
Shake hands?

21:21.430 --> 21:23.430
Stay.

21:23.490 --> 21:24.690
Speak.

21:25.860 --> 21:26.820
All right!

21:26.900 --> 21:27.870
Good boy!

21:27.930 --> 21:29.240
Roll over.

21:31.740 --> 21:33.670
You son of a bitch.

21:33.740 --> 21:35.340
Good show!

Alright. Yay.
