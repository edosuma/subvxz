WEBVTT

00:56.681 --> 00:58.266
Good evening, Dr. Hanover.

01:04.814 --> 01:08.151
I thought we might continue
our conversation about Edmund Tolleson.

01:09.402 --> 01:10.487
Or rather...

01:11.696 --> 01:12.530
end it.

01:12.906 --> 01:15.992
I recognize the pressure you're under
to deem him fit for trial,

01:16.076 --> 01:17.994
but I have to tell you right now,

01:18.453 --> 01:20.914
I simply will not allow you to do that.

01:22.332 --> 01:23.166
No.

01:23.500 --> 01:24.334
I'm sorry.

01:25.043 --> 01:26.795
I will make my own judgment.

01:26.878 --> 01:29.506
I will not be swayed by you
or Governor Wilburn.

01:30.381 --> 01:32.050
I'm genuinely sorry to hear that.

01:33.927 --> 01:35.970
Here I am, just trying to protect you.

01:37.722 --> 01:39.516
If it were ever to get out...

01:40.433 --> 01:42.560
that there were deaths at the hospital...

01:42.644 --> 01:44.437
Are you blackmailing me?

01:44.521 --> 01:46.272
I know where the bodies are buried.

01:47.023 --> 01:47.899
Or, rather...

01:48.900 --> 01:50.068
incinerated.

01:50.860 --> 01:53.738
You are responsible
for two murders thus far.

01:53.822 --> 01:54.656
What?

01:55.073 --> 01:57.158
Charles Wainwright and Mr. Salvatore.

01:57.659 --> 02:00.411
I had nothing to do with Mr. Salvatore.

02:00.495 --> 02:03.623
Maybe you sliced his throat
with your own hands.

02:04.582 --> 02:06.501
Maybe I watched you do it.

02:07.001 --> 02:10.171
It'd be easy enough
to testify to that in court.

02:13.842 --> 02:16.219
Which is why I think
it would be a good idea

02:16.302 --> 02:18.138
for you to appoint me head nurse.

02:19.472 --> 02:22.517
You can alert the staff
after you've informed Nurse Bucket.

02:23.768 --> 02:24.936
You scheming bitch.

02:25.353 --> 02:28.690
Yes. I thought you might wish
to strike me, Doctor.

02:36.573 --> 02:37.490
Search yourself...

02:38.283 --> 02:42.579
and I think you'll realize
it would be wise to do what I ask.

02:52.881 --> 02:54.716
- You wanted to see me, sir?

02:54.799 --> 02:56.050
What is this?

02:56.134 --> 02:57.010
An eclair.

02:57.093 --> 02:59.637
It's a cream-filled pastry
beloved by the French,

02:59.721 --> 03:04.142
made from the same choux dough
that makes profiteroles so very addictive.

03:05.602 --> 03:07.729
I am sick of the gifts, Bucket,

03:07.812 --> 03:09.606
and I am sick of you.

03:10.398 --> 03:13.234
This is about the lesbians, isn't it?

03:13.318 --> 03:16.738
I want your resignation as head nurse
on my desk within the hour.

03:16.821 --> 03:17.697
What?

03:18.281 --> 03:19.115
Well, I--

03:19.866 --> 03:20.992
I'll do no such thing.

03:21.075 --> 03:21.910
Yes, you will.

03:22.535 --> 03:25.705
Because you wish to continue
working at this hospital

03:25.788 --> 03:28.333
and seeing it is run
the way I need it to be run.

03:28.416 --> 03:32.712
And if you do not,
I will give you a lukewarm recommendation.

03:32.795 --> 03:34.672
I have a perfect reputation.

03:34.756 --> 03:37.342
Soon, you will have a middling reputation.

03:37.425 --> 03:41.596
But there's no one else here
who's even remotely qualified.

03:41.679 --> 03:42.889
Who could take my place?

03:44.182 --> 03:45.225
Mildred Ratched.

03:46.517 --> 03:47.852
She will be head nurse.

05:27.327 --> 05:32.081
I am so overwhelmed with gratitude
that I am your new head nurse.

05:36.961 --> 05:39.839
Which means I've temporarily saved you
from Dr. Hanover.

05:41.132 --> 05:43.176
Now I have to save you from the governor.

05:44.510 --> 05:45.636
But I have a plan.

05:45.720 --> 05:48.056
And it is in this spirit of new beginnings

05:48.139 --> 05:50.141
that I would like to propose
a celebration.

05:50.224 --> 05:53.311
I'm going to arrange for a dance
to be thrown at the hospital,

05:53.394 --> 05:57.315
where the staff and patients can enjoy
some time together in a social setting.

05:57.398 --> 05:58.983
Hanover's never gonna go for that.

05:59.067 --> 06:01.235
He will do what I say
because it's the right thing to do.

06:01.319 --> 06:05.656
So, next Thursday,
we will hold a Spring Fling.

06:07.075 --> 06:11.871
Right here in the common room,
with staff and patients.

06:13.247 --> 06:16.501
We'll have music, a little dancing,

06:16.584 --> 06:18.044
and of course, some punch.

06:18.503 --> 06:19.587
During the dance...

06:20.755 --> 06:24.467
you have to convince all of them
you're insane.

06:25.343 --> 06:26.844
Beyond a shadow of a doubt,

06:27.345 --> 06:28.846
so everyone sees it.

06:28.930 --> 06:30.264
Now, let's get to work.

06:40.149 --> 06:41.067
For you.

06:48.783 --> 06:50.284
I have to admit that...

06:51.202 --> 06:54.997
watching you this morning,
yammering away to the nursing staff...

06:56.082 --> 06:59.168
that was one bucket of bile
for me to swallow.

06:59.585 --> 07:01.170
But I need this place to work.

07:01.254 --> 07:04.465
So, I've decided to be a professional.

07:05.842 --> 07:08.386
I will not quietly undermine you

07:08.469 --> 07:11.264
or make your job harder
than it already is.

07:11.347 --> 07:12.390
I'm speechless.

07:12.890 --> 07:13.766
Hm.

07:14.392 --> 07:15.518
It's good...

07:16.477 --> 07:19.981
that you were so persistent
with Dr. Hanover,

07:20.064 --> 07:21.399
because I happen to know

07:21.482 --> 07:23.151
he has feelings for you.

07:23.985 --> 07:24.819
What?

07:25.862 --> 07:26.696
He does?

07:27.238 --> 07:28.239
Oh, yes.

07:29.657 --> 07:32.034
Yes, behind that, um...

07:32.702 --> 07:36.122
cold, academic exterior lies a soft heart,

07:36.205 --> 07:39.083
and with your steady stream of gifts,
you have pierced it.

07:39.167 --> 07:41.252
I think he doesn't know
how to approach you.

07:42.336 --> 07:45.006
You should ask him to the dance.
He will never say no.

07:47.091 --> 07:48.801
Well, I-- I-- I-- don't...

07:50.178 --> 07:51.846
don't know what to say. I mean--

07:51.929 --> 07:54.015
Maybe this demotion happened for a reason.

07:55.850 --> 07:58.895
He couldn't approach you
because of your position of authority,

07:58.978 --> 08:01.022
and now, in his eyes,

08:01.105 --> 08:02.315
you're a woman again.

08:06.110 --> 08:07.445
You should think about it.

08:11.616 --> 08:13.784
You would make the perfect couple.

08:18.498 --> 08:20.458
<i>Nurse Bucket is going</i>
<i>to ask you to the dance.</i>

08:20.541 --> 08:22.168
<i>When she does,</i>
<i>I would like you to say yes.</i>

08:22.251 --> 08:23.628
I can't stand that woman!

08:23.711 --> 08:24.962
That is out of the question.

08:25.046 --> 08:25.963
I'll say it again.

08:26.631 --> 08:29.467
When she asks you to the dance,
you will say yes.

08:29.550 --> 08:30.801
Do you understand?

08:30.885 --> 08:32.678
Why are you doing this?

08:32.762 --> 08:34.805
You're going to have to trust me, Doctor.

08:35.640 --> 08:37.725
-I really am looking out for you.

08:43.731 --> 08:44.857
You're shit!

08:54.450 --> 08:57.161
Look at your bow hold.

08:59.789 --> 09:02.875
That's an incorrect bow hold.

09:02.959 --> 09:07.213
Your thumb should be bent,
you arrogant sack of garbage!

09:07.296 --> 09:08.464
Leave him alone.

09:09.882 --> 09:12.843
Don't you dare talk to me.

09:14.428 --> 09:19.267
I am a graduate of the New England
Conservatory of Music.

09:19.350 --> 09:22.144
The Royal Academy of Music.

09:22.228 --> 09:27.024
Of the Juilliard School of Music.

09:27.108 --> 09:28.693
-Go away.
-No!

09:30.528 --> 09:34.949
I was first chair violin
of the London Symphony Orchestra.

09:35.575 --> 09:40.538
I played Mendelssohn
for Prince Louis II of Monaco.

09:40.621 --> 09:42.540
If Mendelssohn heard you,

09:42.623 --> 09:44.333
he would shoot himself in the head!

09:44.917 --> 09:48.254
Beethoven would fuck you in the face!

09:48.337 --> 09:50.339
You're nothing!

09:50.423 --> 09:52.300
You're excrement.

09:52.925 --> 09:54.427
You're no one!

09:54.510 --> 09:56.887
You don't get to walk away from me!

09:57.430 --> 09:59.223
I am Ondine Duquette!

09:59.307 --> 10:02.768
I played for the King and Queen
of England. Do you hear me?

10:03.227 --> 10:06.022
I am Ondine!

10:06.606 --> 10:09.775
Why don't you tell me why you're here,
Miss Duquette?

10:10.318 --> 10:12.320
It's Wells.

10:12.862 --> 10:15.406
Uh, Charlotte... Wells.

10:20.911 --> 10:23.122
I'm having trouble with my memory.

10:23.748 --> 10:25.082
Lately, I find I...

10:26.125 --> 10:28.085
I simply can't remember things.

10:28.169 --> 10:32.423
Two weeks ago, I found myself
on a train to New York City and

10:32.506 --> 10:34.675
I have no idea how I got on.

10:34.759 --> 10:37.303
Has a doctor ever told you
you might have amnesia?

10:37.845 --> 10:39.555
Yes, two years ago,

10:39.639 --> 10:43.643
I was hospitalized
with melancholia, and...

10:45.102 --> 10:46.812
I tried to take my own life.

10:47.813 --> 10:51.150
That's when the lapses in memory started,
when I was...

10:52.109 --> 10:53.903
locked up in that place.

10:54.570 --> 10:57.323
But I-- I think
it was the drugs they gave me.

10:58.074 --> 10:59.075
What were the drugs?

10:59.158 --> 11:00.117
They never told me.

11:00.618 --> 11:02.912
The drugs kept me awake for days.

11:03.204 --> 11:04.664
Amphetamines are what they gave you,

11:04.747 --> 11:09.126
in a ham-fisted attempt
to treat the melancholia...

11:09.835 --> 11:11.504
likely making it worse.

11:12.546 --> 11:15.716
But that would not have
any lasting effect on your memory.

11:17.677 --> 11:22.056
And I don't think mere melancholia
is what is ailing you, Miss Wells.

11:22.139 --> 11:26.519
The police report said you told him
your name was Ondine Duquette.

11:29.605 --> 11:30.523
Who is that?

11:32.650 --> 11:33.651
I don't know.

11:34.902 --> 11:36.612
I-- I've never seen her.

11:41.742 --> 11:44.036
I've just heard her voice.

11:47.581 --> 11:49.333
When Ondine speaks, you hear her?

11:50.876 --> 11:51.961
Um...

11:52.044 --> 11:54.380
Does she speak to you or to other people?

12:06.142 --> 12:07.518
Ma... Mommy.

12:11.772 --> 12:13.441
Mommy needs to rest.

12:13.858 --> 12:14.775
Ondine?

12:14.859 --> 12:18.154
Mommy needs Baby Taffy
to make her some nice, warm soup.

12:19.697 --> 12:22.908
If she doesn't eat some soup
and get some rest,

12:22.992 --> 12:25.286
then she's never gonna feel better.

12:27.079 --> 12:28.080
Where is Mommy?

12:31.751 --> 12:34.503
She-- She's right over there!

12:36.630 --> 12:43.053
Oh, it's okay, Mommy.
I'm gonna fix you some nice, warm soup--

12:43.137 --> 12:43.971
Taffy--

12:44.054 --> 12:46.432
Get your motherfucking hands off of me!

12:47.349 --> 12:48.559
Don't you know?

12:49.268 --> 12:50.269
He's here.

12:50.770 --> 12:51.812
Who?

12:52.521 --> 12:53.439
Hitler!

12:54.231 --> 12:56.275
Everybody say that son of a bitch is dead.

12:56.692 --> 12:59.278
That motherfucker ain't dead!

12:59.570 --> 13:03.240
That wasn't his bones they left
all burnt up in that bunker!

13:03.324 --> 13:04.450
Hell no!

13:04.533 --> 13:08.120
You think that Nazi-ass motherfucker
ain't got brains enough

13:08.204 --> 13:10.539
to leave some burnt-up bones behind

13:10.623 --> 13:14.293
before he lights out
on a submarine to Argentina?

13:14.376 --> 13:18.464
I humiliated him, Nazi piece of shit!

13:18.547 --> 13:20.257
At his own Olympics!

13:20.841 --> 13:26.138
Came into his stadium
and won five gold medals.

13:26.222 --> 13:28.974
Four-hundred-meter hurdles, boom!

13:29.058 --> 13:30.392
Gold medal!

13:30.476 --> 13:32.812
Swastika-wearing sack of dog shit

13:32.895 --> 13:34.480
-couldn't handle it!
-Charlotte--

13:34.563 --> 13:37.024
I was watching him in the stands!

13:37.107 --> 13:39.902
That silly little mustache of his
kept twitching!

13:39.985 --> 13:43.405
-I want you to know you're safe here--
-I knew he would come after me someday!

13:43.489 --> 13:46.742
-Charlotte, I can help you--
-I knew I would have to kill him myself.

13:47.451 --> 13:48.911
Yaaaah!

13:55.918 --> 13:57.753
Come get me, Adolf!

13:58.712 --> 14:01.048
We're gonna finish this thing,

14:01.131 --> 14:03.467
right here and now!

14:05.177 --> 14:06.512
You're nothing!

14:06.595 --> 14:11.809
You're no one, you ignorant,
no-talent nothing!

14:12.685 --> 14:14.520
Let go of me!

14:15.145 --> 14:18.816
I need to be on a train
to New York City tonight.

14:18.899 --> 14:20.818
I am first chair violin

14:20.901 --> 14:23.946
-of the New York Symphony Orchestra!
-Charlotte.

14:24.029 --> 14:26.365
-I'm administering a sleep cure.

14:26.448 --> 14:28.909
You'll be given a steady dose
for six days,

14:28.993 --> 14:30.828
safe under constant watch.

14:30.911 --> 14:32.663
Your nervous system is exhausted,

14:33.163 --> 14:34.832
and you need very much to rest.

14:45.467 --> 14:46.385
Where am I?

14:47.928 --> 14:48.762
You're safe.

14:49.305 --> 14:53.601
You're suffering from what is known
as multiple personality disorder.

14:58.981 --> 14:59.857
What...

15:01.317 --> 15:02.359
What is that?

15:03.444 --> 15:07.072
A trauma in your past
caused your psyche to split.

15:08.032 --> 15:11.035
-We must get to the root of this trauma--
-No, you don't understand, I...

15:12.244 --> 15:16.165
-The doctors told me it was melancholia.
-No, no.

15:17.416 --> 15:18.751
You've been misdiagnosed.

15:21.754 --> 15:22.755
Rest now, Charlotte.

15:24.173 --> 15:25.007
Rest now.

15:26.091 --> 15:27.009
I can help you.

15:28.510 --> 15:29.345
Trust me.

15:31.430 --> 15:32.264
Shh.

15:33.349 --> 15:34.350
You're safe now.

15:41.899 --> 15:42.983
Okay. Very good.

15:50.991 --> 15:52.117
Dr. Hanover!

15:52.785 --> 15:54.411
You stay away from me!

15:54.495 --> 15:56.747
Are you going to tell me
how to treat Miss Wells, too?

15:56.830 --> 15:58.666
No, I just... I don't understand.

16:00.042 --> 16:03.045
Dissociative disorders are
notoriously difficult to diagnose.

16:03.128 --> 16:04.713
They present as a whole host of maladies;

16:04.797 --> 16:08.008
mania, dementia, melancholy,
amnesia, schizophrenia.

16:08.092 --> 16:09.009
Now, please...

16:10.177 --> 16:13.555
leave me alone to treat her
in a manner that I see fit.

16:14.598 --> 16:16.016
She's an extraordinary case,

16:16.100 --> 16:18.519
which makes the proper treatment
all the more important.

16:18.936 --> 16:19.937
I agree with you.

16:21.397 --> 16:24.358
Show the governor that you can
rehabilitate someone like Miss Wells,

16:24.441 --> 16:26.568
and he'll forget
all about Edmund Tolleson.

16:27.569 --> 16:31.156
Show him the Dr. Hanover
I just saw in that room.

16:31.657 --> 16:33.742
Kind, decisive.

16:35.494 --> 16:38.831
And he will give you
all the money you could possibly need.

16:46.296 --> 16:48.007
Did the governor tell you that one?

16:48.090 --> 16:51.176
No, the jokes the governor tells
I don't care to repeat.

16:53.178 --> 16:57.808
By the way, the governor wants
the Edmund Tolleson matter concluded

16:57.891 --> 16:58.976
by the end of the month.

16:59.435 --> 17:00.269
Of course.

17:02.312 --> 17:05.190
We both want that monster
to get exactly what he deserves.

17:07.651 --> 17:08.610
So, Mildred.

17:10.362 --> 17:11.697
Why did you ask me here?

17:11.780 --> 17:14.408
You rebuffed my advance
in no uncertain terms.

17:14.491 --> 17:16.952
You told me I was presuming
all the wrong things.

17:22.708 --> 17:24.293
I'm going to say one thing...

17:26.045 --> 17:28.756
and then I'm going to ask you
not to bring it up again.

17:30.174 --> 17:31.008
All right.

17:32.676 --> 17:34.219
I do have feelings for you.

17:35.471 --> 17:36.305
Although...

17:37.389 --> 17:39.141
I don't entirely understand them.

17:41.560 --> 17:44.021
So I need to do this my own way.

17:44.521 --> 17:46.023
I understand completely.

17:48.484 --> 17:49.735
It took me quite a while.

17:53.989 --> 17:55.699
I was very in love with a girl...

17:57.576 --> 17:58.660
who went off to war.

18:01.038 --> 18:01.872
She was a nurse.

18:02.790 --> 18:03.791
She, um...

18:06.710 --> 18:07.961
she didn't make it back.

18:13.592 --> 18:14.885
Isn't it funny, then?

18:16.804 --> 18:17.721
That I'm a nurse.

18:26.563 --> 18:27.648
I forgot to tell you.

18:27.731 --> 18:29.900
Dr. Hanover has made me head nurse.

18:29.983 --> 18:31.110
-He has?
-Yes.

18:31.485 --> 18:32.486
Well, congratulations.

18:32.569 --> 18:34.321
-It's a very big deal.

18:35.572 --> 18:37.658
So, I've decided to organize a dance.

18:40.619 --> 18:42.746
Would you have any interest in attending?

18:45.541 --> 18:46.917
As my companion?

18:47.000 --> 18:47.835
Mildred.

18:49.503 --> 18:51.004
Nothing would make me happier.

18:54.133 --> 18:55.008
Good.

19:40.721 --> 19:42.764
I'd like to have a room, please.

19:43.932 --> 19:46.226
This is our finest room.

19:46.310 --> 19:48.228
We have two double beds,

19:48.312 --> 19:50.355
and I just washed the bathroom.

19:52.149 --> 19:54.318
I wouldn't let my monkey stay here.

19:54.401 --> 19:56.069
Where's the next real city?

19:56.153 --> 19:59.448
There's Salinas and, um... uh...
Watsonville and--

19:59.531 --> 20:00.365
San Francisco.

20:01.074 --> 20:02.951
San Francisco.

20:03.035 --> 20:04.161
Mildred Ratched?

20:04.870 --> 20:05.913
Where is she?

20:05.996 --> 20:07.372
She's room 10.

20:12.502 --> 20:14.588
I'm off to find more suitable lodging.

20:14.671 --> 20:16.381
You'll be hearing from me shortly.

20:19.176 --> 20:21.803
I've taken over
the top floor of this place.

20:22.971 --> 20:25.432
Though the wallpaper hurts my feelings.

20:27.142 --> 20:28.101
Thank you.

20:28.185 --> 20:30.103
I'm flying in my decorator.

20:31.355 --> 20:32.481
Where's your monkey?

20:32.898 --> 20:34.274
Oh, in her suite.

20:34.358 --> 20:36.318
I never bring her to business meetings.

20:38.654 --> 20:41.073
No, I said lemon wedges.

20:41.156 --> 20:42.491
Take it easy.

20:53.752 --> 20:56.380
You look like a woman
who knows her way around the world.

20:56.463 --> 20:58.257
I think we have that in common.

20:58.757 --> 21:00.467
So, I'll cut to the chase.

21:00.550 --> 21:03.553
I sent a man to do
what was clearly a woman's job.

21:04.429 --> 21:06.265
You work for the doctor. Am I right?

21:06.348 --> 21:07.182
Yes.

21:07.266 --> 21:08.892
He told me what he did...

21:11.603 --> 21:12.437
to your son.

21:16.608 --> 21:19.194
My son was a wild child.

21:19.278 --> 21:22.447
For the life of me,
I did not know what to do.

21:22.531 --> 21:26.326
Then, one day,
I heard this beautiful singing

21:26.410 --> 21:27.577
coming from the attic.

21:29.621 --> 21:31.957
Just simple scales.

21:32.791 --> 21:36.378
Over and over again, but it was beautiful.

21:39.298 --> 21:44.094
As I climbed the attic stairs,
I realized it wasn't singing.

21:44.928 --> 21:45.804
It was a cello.

21:47.139 --> 21:49.599
He found a cello.
I didn't even know we had one.

21:49.683 --> 21:51.852
And then I saw my son.

21:54.271 --> 21:56.606
He was sitting there, perfectly still.

21:58.066 --> 22:00.152
Completely serene.

22:02.904 --> 22:05.991
And he was playing these scales.

22:07.951 --> 22:09.661
Pitch perfect.

22:13.874 --> 22:14.833
I remember...

22:16.418 --> 22:17.252
his...

22:18.086 --> 22:22.341
beautiful little hands,
somehow just knowing...

22:23.050 --> 22:23.884
how to...

22:25.052 --> 22:27.429
tremble against the strings...

22:28.180 --> 22:29.181
just enough...

22:30.098 --> 22:32.351
to create the most beautiful...

22:33.226 --> 22:35.479
fragile vibrato.

22:37.814 --> 22:40.525
It was the only time I ever saw my son...

22:41.902 --> 22:44.112
just perfectly still.

22:48.700 --> 22:49.659
And that...

22:50.994 --> 22:52.704
is why that Doctor...

22:54.998 --> 22:59.920
Hanover, or whatever he's calling himself
these days...

23:01.338 --> 23:02.381
must die.

23:03.965 --> 23:06.676
I understand you completely, Mrs. Osgood.

23:08.929 --> 23:10.138
I will be happy...

23:11.223 --> 23:13.600
to relieve you of this suffering.

23:20.816 --> 23:22.901
I would like one million dollars.

23:24.486 --> 23:26.822
I realize that is
an enormous sum of money,

23:26.905 --> 23:30.492
but I, too, have a family member
who is helpless without me.

23:30.575 --> 23:32.786
And my circumstances will soon be such

23:32.869 --> 23:35.789
that I will not be able to provide for him
as I have been.

23:37.332 --> 23:39.626
You're taking advantage of me.

23:40.210 --> 23:43.839
You must understand,
I am trying to protect my family.

23:44.548 --> 23:47.843
No one takes advantage of me.

24:02.816 --> 24:03.859
Dr. Hanover?

24:04.734 --> 24:05.902
What are you doing?

24:08.029 --> 24:09.823
I wanted to just ask you...

24:13.201 --> 24:15.579
I was wondering if you would be willing...

24:16.121 --> 24:17.581
to go to the dance with me?

24:18.748 --> 24:19.708
As my date.

24:24.588 --> 24:25.755
Yes, I'd like that.

24:26.423 --> 24:28.383
Oh. My...

24:28.467 --> 24:32.554
Is there a, uh...
kind of corsage you would like?

24:33.013 --> 24:34.055
Why...

24:35.015 --> 24:37.309
Gardenias, of course.

24:39.478 --> 24:41.188
I'm very excited.

24:44.149 --> 24:46.776
Well, I'll leave you to your work,
whatever that might be.

24:47.235 --> 24:48.278
Hypnotherapy.

24:48.361 --> 24:49.696
-Oh.
-For Miss Wells.

24:50.780 --> 24:53.617
I've studied hypnosis,
but never performed it.

24:55.076 --> 24:59.331
Patients displaying multiple personalities
tend to be quite easy to hypnotize.

25:00.457 --> 25:02.042
Would you mind if I try it on you?

25:03.627 --> 25:04.753
Are you kidding?

25:05.795 --> 25:07.214
I would be delighted.

25:07.297 --> 25:08.507
Please, sit.

25:09.508 --> 25:12.260
This is a red-letter day for Betsy Bucket!

25:12.344 --> 25:13.762
-Just relax.
-Oh, yeah.

25:15.180 --> 25:17.224
And stare at the spinning disc.

25:20.477 --> 25:22.979
You will begin to think only of sleep.

25:25.649 --> 25:27.108
With each exhale...

25:28.151 --> 25:31.696
you feel sleep spreading
through your body.

25:33.740 --> 25:34.616
A deep...

25:35.408 --> 25:36.868
profound sleep.

25:39.788 --> 25:40.872
Also...

25:41.456 --> 25:42.832
with each breath...

25:44.668 --> 25:47.420
as you fall into a deep sleep...

25:49.631 --> 25:50.632
you realize...

25:53.802 --> 25:55.845
you wish to go to the dance alone.

25:58.431 --> 26:00.433
Or perhaps not go to the dance at all.

26:00.517 --> 26:01.351
What?

26:01.893 --> 26:03.270
What are you talking about?

26:03.353 --> 26:06.064
I wouldn't miss that dance for anything.

26:06.731 --> 26:08.233
I don't think this is working.

26:08.316 --> 26:09.526
Well, no, I...

26:09.609 --> 26:12.988
Yeah, I was gonna say,
I don't feel hypnotized at all.

26:16.491 --> 26:18.201
Maybe, I guess it's...

26:18.285 --> 26:19.953
it just doesn't work with everyone?

26:20.704 --> 26:21.746
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

26:23.456 --> 26:26.835
So, were you going to pick me up?
Or should we just meet here, or...

26:47.355 --> 26:48.857
Hey there, Doll-baby.

26:50.817 --> 26:52.277
Did you hear about the dance?

26:52.360 --> 26:53.320
Mm.

26:54.779 --> 26:58.366
I went out and bought
the prettiest pink dress I could find.

26:58.450 --> 26:59.451
Mm.

27:00.327 --> 27:02.162
I've never been to a dance before.

27:02.245 --> 27:03.079
Huh.

27:03.163 --> 27:05.290
-Mother didn't trust me enough.

27:06.124 --> 27:08.960
Dancing wasn't allowed
in any of the foster homes I grew up in.

27:10.337 --> 27:11.796
I took a look at your file.

27:13.006 --> 27:15.258
I read about what you did
to those priests.

27:25.352 --> 27:26.811
Do you think I'm a monster?

27:28.104 --> 27:28.938
No.

27:31.107 --> 27:31.941
You said...

27:32.692 --> 27:33.818
one of those men...

27:35.528 --> 27:38.448
raped your mother, then abandoned her.

27:39.157 --> 27:40.909
That man put rage inside you.

27:41.993 --> 27:43.745
And I know what that feels like...

27:44.704 --> 27:46.206
because I have it in me, too.

27:52.170 --> 27:53.880
I wish we could run out of here.

27:56.424 --> 27:58.301
That we could go far, far away.

28:01.888 --> 28:05.058
<i>Run through a moonlit field, laughing.</i>

28:05.141 --> 28:07.310
<i>Nobody telling us how we gotta live.</i>

28:07.394 --> 28:09.521
We could be free...

28:09.604 --> 28:11.690
...from whatever you and I
did in our past.

28:12.315 --> 28:13.483
<i>That would all be over.</i>

28:13.566 --> 28:14.984
<i>We wouldn't have a past.</i>

28:15.694 --> 28:19.989
<i>Only the future stretching out</i>
<i>ahead of us as far as we can see,</i>

28:20.073 --> 28:21.533
<i>all the way to the horizon.</i>

28:22.117 --> 28:23.618
I'd like that very much.

28:26.830 --> 28:27.831
I love you, Dolly.

28:36.464 --> 28:37.340
Nurse?

28:38.675 --> 28:39.634
Yes, I'm coming.

29:10.874 --> 29:12.125
How did you get in here?

29:12.208 --> 29:15.545
I told the guards you had lice,
so they wouldn't escort me inside.

29:17.255 --> 29:18.298
Cover up, please.

29:21.885 --> 29:23.470
I hatched us a plan.

29:23.553 --> 29:27.015
I'll prove to everyone at that dance
that I'm certifiable.

29:27.098 --> 29:31.102
All I need from you is something small
and metal and sharp.

29:33.104 --> 29:35.690
I'll start screaming
like I've been possessed.

29:40.278 --> 29:42.030
<i>And then I'll cut myself.</i>

29:45.950 --> 29:47.035
Good.

29:55.543 --> 29:56.795
Hell no!

29:56.878 --> 30:01.216
You can kiss my gold-medal-winning ass,
you low-down motherfucker!

30:01.299 --> 30:05.386
-Charlotte, hypnosis is harmless.
-I ain't gonna let you Svengali me!

30:05.470 --> 30:06.971
Hitler's gonna walk through that door

30:07.055 --> 30:08.515
-any minute.
-And individuals suffering

30:08.598 --> 30:10.642
-from multiple personalities...
-We got to be prepared!

30:10.725 --> 30:12.685
...are generally very easily hypnotized.

30:15.104 --> 30:16.606
Do I have your permission?

30:26.324 --> 30:27.367
Thank you, Apollo.

30:28.284 --> 30:30.829
And thank you, Ondine, and Baby Taffy.

30:32.789 --> 30:34.415
But right now, Charlotte...

30:35.583 --> 30:37.710
I want you to keep staring at the disc...

30:38.503 --> 30:39.796
and think only of sleep.

30:42.006 --> 30:43.007
Sleep.

30:44.759 --> 30:46.010
Going sound...

30:46.761 --> 30:48.638
sound asleep.

30:51.641 --> 30:53.101
Are you asleep?

30:55.061 --> 30:56.938
You're shit.

30:58.439 --> 31:00.441
You're nothing.

31:00.525 --> 31:04.946
I played Shostakovich's Concerto No. 1...

31:05.029 --> 31:07.365
-You're passing into a deep...
-...in A minor...

31:07.448 --> 31:11.202
-...profound sleep.
-...for King Leopold of Belgium.

31:11.953 --> 31:13.955
Going deeply to sleep.

31:15.707 --> 31:18.209
And Charlotte, as you fall asleep...

31:19.460 --> 31:24.424
please thank Apollo, and Ondine
and Baby Taffy for protecting you,

31:25.133 --> 31:26.551
and always keeping you safe.

31:33.516 --> 31:34.767
Are you there, Charlotte?

31:36.853 --> 31:37.979
Yes.

31:42.442 --> 31:43.276
Yes.

31:50.158 --> 31:51.492
Please open your eyes.

31:58.583 --> 31:59.500
Hello, Charlotte.

32:00.460 --> 32:01.294
It's me.

32:01.920 --> 32:02.921
Dr. Hanover.

32:06.674 --> 32:09.010
You experienced a severe trauma,

32:09.093 --> 32:12.722
and several personalities emerged
from your psyche,

32:13.348 --> 32:16.434
as a way to protect you
from the pain of that trauma.

32:19.437 --> 32:22.357
I want you to tell me
what happened to you.

32:22.815 --> 32:23.775
If I tell you...

32:24.817 --> 32:26.778
they'll make me go away again, and...

32:27.904 --> 32:29.322
I don't want to go away.

32:29.405 --> 32:31.115
The others aren't here, Charlotte.

32:32.200 --> 32:33.284
It's just you and I.

32:34.494 --> 32:37.622
And you needn't be afraid to tell me
what happened to you.

32:38.373 --> 32:39.874
You're safe, Charlotte.

32:49.467 --> 32:50.635
Two years ago...

32:52.595 --> 32:56.557
I was traveling to the University
of Maryland to attend a lecture.

33:01.020 --> 33:04.399
Walking home,
it was late and I was alone.

33:05.483 --> 33:08.111
I was attacked by four young, white men.

33:09.278 --> 33:10.405
They beat me and...

33:11.114 --> 33:12.949
threw me into the trunk of a car.

33:14.158 --> 33:16.536
They drove me to an abandoned house.

33:16.953 --> 33:19.080
They dragged me into the basement, and...

33:19.872 --> 33:21.082
they beat me again.

33:22.125 --> 33:23.209
Did they rape you?

33:23.543 --> 33:24.377
No.

33:25.378 --> 33:26.963
I thought they were going to.

33:28.798 --> 33:32.802
They took off my clothes
and locked me in a closet.

33:34.679 --> 33:37.223
I don't know how long I was in there.

33:38.683 --> 33:39.517
You do know.

33:41.644 --> 33:42.812
Nine days.

33:45.398 --> 33:47.108
Nine days.

33:50.570 --> 33:56.284
Every day, they would pull me out
of the closet and hit me or chase me.

33:57.577 --> 33:59.328
They made me eat dog food.

34:01.414 --> 34:03.708
One of the boys
didn't want to be involved.

34:03.791 --> 34:05.251
He kept pointing out that

34:05.334 --> 34:08.755
some of my wounds were getting infected
from sitting in my feces.

34:09.881 --> 34:12.592
I think he might have been the one
who told the police.

34:13.801 --> 34:15.011
Because late at night...

34:15.720 --> 34:20.099
on the ninth day,
an officer came and unlocked the door.

34:22.685 --> 34:24.479
He told me he would let me go

34:24.562 --> 34:27.565
if I agreed not to press charges
against the boys.

34:30.318 --> 34:32.862
I think it might have been
one of the boys' father.

34:35.281 --> 34:38.201
He had a clean set of clothing with him.

34:41.079 --> 34:42.955
He gave me five dollars and...

34:44.415 --> 34:46.000
drove me to the bus station.

34:50.379 --> 34:51.506
Thank you, Charlotte.

34:54.592 --> 34:55.551
Go back to sleep.

35:07.688 --> 35:09.065
When I snap my finger...

35:10.191 --> 35:11.067
you'll awaken.

35:12.693 --> 35:14.237
You and you alone.

35:15.947 --> 35:19.200
You will realize that
your trauma is in the past.

35:21.035 --> 35:22.912
And while you will never forget it...

35:24.747 --> 35:27.625
this event no longer controls you.

35:39.846 --> 35:40.721
How do you feel?

35:53.234 --> 35:54.068
Relieved.

36:01.367 --> 36:05.496
<i>Under hypnosis, the subject</i>
<i>described kidnapping and torture.</i>

36:05.580 --> 36:07.623
<i>She was locked up in a closet</i>
<i>for nine days</i>

36:07.707 --> 36:09.000
and repeatedly beaten.

36:22.138 --> 36:23.723
I think I helped someone today.

36:26.100 --> 36:27.977
I really helped someone.

36:53.920 --> 36:55.379
Ready to cut a rug?

36:55.463 --> 36:56.714
Nice to see you.

36:59.300 --> 37:00.218
Come on in.

37:00.301 --> 37:02.553
How's the book club, anyway?

37:02.637 --> 37:04.555
Still can't believe they voted me out.

37:04.639 --> 37:06.390
Who knew they could do such a thing?

37:06.474 --> 37:09.685
And all because I'm an alcoholic,
whatever that means.

37:09.769 --> 37:12.355
Betsy, is that beef Stroganoff?

37:12.438 --> 37:16.192
Yes, it's just a little recipe
off a Libby's can I've been working on,

37:16.275 --> 37:21.197
because you never know when
a gentleman caller might darken your door.

37:21.280 --> 37:25.409
Mm, you really have it bad
for that Dr. Hanover.

37:31.249 --> 37:34.752
I would like to put your dancing skills
to good use.

37:35.378 --> 37:40.675
See, Dr. Hanover and I will be attending
the hospital dance together.

37:41.425 --> 37:42.593
Ooh.

37:43.511 --> 37:44.553
You're kidding me.

37:46.013 --> 37:47.098
I gotta say...

37:47.848 --> 37:50.893
it was the gifts that melted his heart.

37:51.852 --> 37:52.770
Mm.

37:54.897 --> 37:55.731
Decadent.

37:56.983 --> 37:58.276
Lilies of the valley.

37:59.944 --> 38:02.238
These remind me of my dear,
departed mother.

38:05.574 --> 38:06.409
Thank you.

38:06.867 --> 38:10.663
I knew the feelings were there,
but he is so intimidated by me.

38:10.746 --> 38:12.957
I knew he wouldn't ask me
to the dance himself.

38:13.040 --> 38:14.834
So, I asked him.

38:14.917 --> 38:16.419
Yes.

38:16.502 --> 38:19.380
Yes, I will go to the dance with you.

38:19.463 --> 38:22.383
See, I'm not head nurse anymore.

38:22.842 --> 38:25.970
So there's none of that pesky
power dynamic.

38:26.053 --> 38:27.638
He's free to be himself.

38:28.097 --> 38:29.640
And after the dance...

38:30.516 --> 38:31.851
Oh, my.

38:32.435 --> 38:33.394
Who knows? I--

38:35.062 --> 38:39.317
I wouldn't be surprised
if we were honeymooning within a month.

38:39.692 --> 38:42.361
I hate weddings, but yours I'll come to.

38:42.820 --> 38:46.532
I want this love affair to start off
on the... on the right footing,

38:46.615 --> 38:49.535
so, I really need to brush up
on my dancing.

38:49.618 --> 38:51.829
So, since you're an old flapper,

38:51.912 --> 38:56.459
I thought maybe you could help me practice
my fox-trot, my box step...

38:57.043 --> 38:57.877
my waltz.

38:58.711 --> 38:59.920
I got your back.

39:00.338 --> 39:01.422
Oh.

39:01.505 --> 39:02.340
Thank you.

39:26.072 --> 39:28.532
I've never seen you look so happy.

39:28.949 --> 39:34.747
Well, there are two things in this world
that make me feel right in myself.

39:34.830 --> 39:37.792
And one is Dr. Hanover, and the other...

39:38.918 --> 39:40.294
is revenge.

39:42.004 --> 39:43.339
Mildred Ratched.

39:43.422 --> 39:44.423
Oh!

39:44.507 --> 39:46.384
I hate that stuck-up bitch.

39:46.467 --> 39:47.593
Oh, yeah.

39:48.386 --> 39:51.305
I made nice with her,
so she'd think that we were friends,

39:51.389 --> 39:52.473
but you know...

39:53.349 --> 39:56.143
I wouldn't shed a tear
if she dropped dead tomorrow.

39:56.560 --> 39:57.395
You know what I mean?

39:58.729 --> 40:04.485
I am just trying to protect Dr. Hanover,
because she is up to something.

40:04.568 --> 40:06.028
I can smell it.

40:06.112 --> 40:09.990
So, when I'm at the dance
with Dr. Hanover...

40:11.242 --> 40:15.996
cradled in his not overly large
but still quite strong arms...

40:16.080 --> 40:16.914
Mm.

40:16.997 --> 40:19.875
...you will be keying into her room,

40:20.543 --> 40:23.838
rifling through her stuff
like a truffle pig,

40:23.921 --> 40:26.382
looking for all the dirt that you can.

40:26.465 --> 40:27.550
Ooh, I love this!

40:36.559 --> 40:37.435
How many?

40:37.518 --> 40:38.644
-Table for one, please.
-Sure.

41:23.939 --> 41:26.150
-What are you doing here?
-She's here, I saw her!

41:26.233 --> 41:27.151
-Who?
-Lenore,

41:27.234 --> 41:28.777
the woman I told you about.

41:28.861 --> 41:31.489
She wants to kill me.
I... I need to stay here.

41:31.572 --> 41:33.491
No, no, no, you need to listen to me.

41:33.574 --> 41:35.618
-Just calm down--
-Please!

41:40.122 --> 41:42.416
I'm falling apart, Nurse Ratched!

41:43.876 --> 41:45.711
For several years now, I've been--

41:45.794 --> 41:48.881
I've been abusing
several different medications.

41:49.381 --> 41:51.592
I need help!

41:51.675 --> 41:52.635
Stop that.

41:53.886 --> 41:54.762
Stop that!

41:56.972 --> 41:58.349
If you want me to help you,

41:58.432 --> 41:59.517
then I need to think.

42:00.100 --> 42:01.644
-Okay?

42:03.395 --> 42:04.230
Okay.

42:09.485 --> 42:10.945
Has she gone to the police?

42:12.905 --> 42:14.031
I don't know. I--

42:14.573 --> 42:15.950
I don't think so, no.

42:16.325 --> 42:18.202
Well, maybe there's a reason for that.

42:18.744 --> 42:20.412
She must have secrets, too.

42:21.956 --> 42:23.457
And that makes her vulnerable.

42:25.251 --> 42:27.002
You should go back to the hospital.

42:27.795 --> 42:29.713
Tell the guards there's a...

42:30.381 --> 42:31.882
an ex-patient of yours, um...

42:32.716 --> 42:33.717
a woman,

42:33.801 --> 42:35.344
and she's threatened your life.

42:36.136 --> 42:39.223
You'll be safe there for now.
You can sleep in your office. Now, go!

42:39.723 --> 42:41.058
You shouldn't be seen here.

42:41.141 --> 42:43.102
If you do what I tell you,

42:43.185 --> 42:44.436
you will be all right.

42:57.366 --> 42:58.200
Hello.

42:59.076 --> 43:00.119
Hm.

43:03.372 --> 43:04.540
What were you thinking?

43:05.207 --> 43:06.458
Now he knows you're here.

43:06.875 --> 43:08.043
I'm not crazy.

43:08.419 --> 43:11.088
Well, he's holed up at the hospital
under armed guard.

43:11.755 --> 43:13.215
You'll never get to him now.

43:13.716 --> 43:15.634
I didn't just show up.

43:16.218 --> 43:17.052
I followed him.

43:18.470 --> 43:19.847
All day.

43:20.764 --> 43:21.640
And...

43:23.475 --> 43:25.519
...I had a gun in my purse.

43:31.734 --> 43:35.446
I thought if I followed him around
all day,

43:35.529 --> 43:39.199
I might eventually become so enraged...

43:39.283 --> 43:43.287
...that I would just blow
his brains right out of his skull.

43:45.289 --> 43:49.585
But then I thought,
"Who's going to take care of my son?"

43:49.668 --> 43:51.587
I have to take care of everything.

43:51.670 --> 43:54.882
I have to feed him and bathe him,

43:54.965 --> 43:57.301
and clean up after him when he...

43:58.802 --> 44:00.721
defecates all over himself.

44:01.680 --> 44:02.848
I have to do everything.

44:02.931 --> 44:05.434
I understand, Mrs. Osgood, I do,

44:05.517 --> 44:06.727
and I sympathize.

44:09.146 --> 44:10.397
I am on your side.

44:12.024 --> 44:13.150
I am, I mean it.

44:15.653 --> 44:17.571
I cannot go to prison.

44:18.530 --> 44:20.949
I cannot be implicated in a murder.

44:21.033 --> 44:22.117
Of course not.

44:23.911 --> 44:25.412
I would never let that happen.

44:27.081 --> 44:30.584
I'll pay you $100,000
and not a penny more.

44:32.127 --> 44:33.128
Take it or leave it.

44:51.313 --> 44:52.189
I'll do it.

44:54.191 --> 44:55.442
I will kill him for you.

44:56.777 --> 44:58.696
And I will make sure that he suffers.

45:05.369 --> 45:06.370
And if I were you...

45:07.621 --> 45:08.706
I'd go with the pink.

45:11.959 --> 45:13.293
Looks nice with the couch.

45:20.843 --> 45:25.764
Step, touch, step, touch,
one, two, one, two...

45:26.557 --> 45:27.391
Hey, sis.

45:28.809 --> 45:30.936
Got my dancing shoes
all polished and ready.

45:31.019 --> 45:32.312
Edmund, pay attention.

45:32.896 --> 45:36.150
At around 8:00 this evening, you'll be
brought up to the dance and unshackled.

45:36.233 --> 45:37.151
Mm.

45:37.234 --> 45:39.903
They will have swept the room
for knives and sharp objects,

45:39.987 --> 45:43.449
and Harold will be armed,
so that everyone feels safe.

45:43.532 --> 45:46.952
I've instructed all the nurses
and patients who will be in attendance

45:47.035 --> 45:48.662
not to make eye contact with you.

45:48.746 --> 45:52.082
I've told them you're part
of a vanguard insanity experiment

45:52.166 --> 45:55.502
that Hanover is running to see
how you respond to a social setting...

45:56.628 --> 45:58.922
and that they should simply ignore you.

46:00.549 --> 46:02.509
How'd you get Hanover to agree to that?

46:02.593 --> 46:03.635
I didn't.

46:05.304 --> 46:06.513
His mind is elsewhere.

46:08.515 --> 46:09.641
And I'm in charge here.

46:11.018 --> 46:15.355
Why, Gielgud himself saw me
give my Thane of Cawdor at the Old Vic,

46:15.439 --> 46:20.235
and afterwards said to me
he'd never seen a performance so loud!

46:22.196 --> 46:23.197
I'm nervous.

46:24.364 --> 46:26.158
There's nothing to be nervous about.

46:31.246 --> 46:33.081
Would you care to dance, Miss Wells?

46:53.018 --> 46:55.604
This is the fourth time
I've brought you punch.

46:56.188 --> 46:58.148
I'd really like to hit the floor.

46:59.316 --> 47:00.150
Fine.

47:21.755 --> 47:22.714
I'll be right back.

47:41.233 --> 47:42.276
Have you seen Dolly?

47:43.735 --> 47:46.697
That's your fucking
problem now, Head Nurse.

47:46.780 --> 47:49.283
I'm just here to dance with my man.

48:34.912 --> 48:36.997
Come on! I wanna do the Charleston!

49:13.909 --> 49:15.160
Whoo!

50:08.338 --> 50:10.215
- Punch?
- Oh, thank you.

50:11.800 --> 50:13.552
She's a great nurse, isn't she?

50:14.386 --> 50:15.762
She's a true caregiver.

50:16.221 --> 50:18.348
The razor blade is
under the pile of serviettes.

50:19.391 --> 50:20.392
Her?

50:20.851 --> 50:23.270
-Oh, yeah, she's a peach.

50:24.229 --> 50:26.690
I don't believe we've met.
I'm-- I'm Gwendolyn Briggs.

50:27.357 --> 50:28.233
Betsy Bucket.

50:28.859 --> 50:31.069
-Nice to meet you.
-Mm. What are you doing here?

50:31.153 --> 50:32.237
I'm here with Mildred.

50:33.196 --> 50:34.114
As a chaperone.

50:34.614 --> 50:35.490
Chaperone?

50:37.409 --> 50:38.326
Interesting.

50:44.124 --> 50:46.043
You know,
you don't need to be nervous.

50:46.126 --> 50:47.002
Huh?

50:47.085 --> 50:49.963
You don't need to be nervous.
Nothing bad is gonna happen.

50:51.548 --> 50:52.424
I know.

50:52.507 --> 50:55.343
It's just the last policeman I met
was not a kind man.

50:56.470 --> 50:57.345
Well, look at me.

50:58.388 --> 50:59.264
I'm kind.

51:01.308 --> 51:02.851
Get on up, princess.

51:03.602 --> 51:05.395
You're about as pretty as those pearls.

51:09.316 --> 51:10.734
Oh, look at you.

51:40.013 --> 51:42.140
For God's sake,
what do you think you're doing?

51:42.224 --> 51:43.517
Back off, Bucket.

51:43.600 --> 51:45.435
You're not head nurse anymore.

51:45.519 --> 51:46.603
Live your own life.

51:52.359 --> 51:53.485
You remember the plan?

51:54.945 --> 51:55.821
Say it.

51:56.446 --> 51:58.573
When we get the nod, I take out the guard.

51:59.866 --> 52:00.700
Be quick.

52:01.409 --> 52:02.577
You gotta be real fast.

52:03.578 --> 52:04.496
The car's outside.

52:05.122 --> 52:05.956
Engine running.

52:10.544 --> 52:12.712
Come on, let's dance.

52:13.171 --> 52:14.256
We already did.

52:14.339 --> 52:16.675
Yes, we danced, kind sir,

52:16.758 --> 52:19.302
because we're at a dance
where people dance,

52:19.386 --> 52:20.595
usually more than once.

52:43.326 --> 52:45.245
Look at us, just standing here.

52:45.328 --> 52:47.330
We should be out there on the floor.

52:49.124 --> 52:50.000
Yes.

52:51.626 --> 52:52.502
Maybe someday.

52:58.175 --> 52:59.050
Mildred.

53:00.260 --> 53:02.095
If I could have the honor...

53:04.055 --> 53:05.265
Would you dance with me?

53:06.433 --> 53:07.392
Yes, of course.

53:17.694 --> 53:20.614
Oh, look at everyone.
They're staring at us.

53:22.449 --> 53:23.450
Who can blame them?

53:24.284 --> 53:25.911
A doctor and a nurse.

53:25.994 --> 53:27.495
It's like a storybook.

53:29.372 --> 53:30.707
No, it isn't.

53:31.333 --> 53:33.877
-There's no storybook like that.

53:33.960 --> 53:36.963
Maybe you don't want children,
and that's fine.

53:38.215 --> 53:42.636
I'd be content with a little house,
white picket fence.

53:42.719 --> 53:46.765
Sundays snuggled up
on the porch swing,

53:46.848 --> 53:49.643
drinking our coffee,
reading our newspaper.

53:50.101 --> 53:50.936
That's enough!

53:51.686 --> 53:53.939
Let me be very clear about something.

53:54.356 --> 53:55.357
Yes? What is it?

53:55.440 --> 53:59.444
Since the day I set foot in this hospital,
I have loathed you.

53:59.527 --> 54:03.323
But you came with the facility,
and the previous owner liked you somehow

54:03.406 --> 54:05.367
and begged me not to fire you.

54:05.450 --> 54:07.619
-What--
-Nothing is going to happen between us.

54:07.702 --> 54:08.536
Nothing!

54:09.663 --> 54:11.873
I am sick and tired of women
telling me what to do,

54:11.957 --> 54:13.750
and I'm not going to take it anymore.

54:14.918 --> 54:17.045
You will never speak to me again.
Do you understand?

54:17.128 --> 54:18.171
If you do...

54:19.047 --> 54:20.090
I will strike you.

54:20.674 --> 54:22.842
I will strike you in the face!

54:25.804 --> 54:26.638
Hey.

54:31.101 --> 54:33.311
That poor woman.
Someone should go after her.

54:38.108 --> 54:39.442
Well, if you won't, I will.

54:45.740 --> 54:46.574
Ready?

54:56.918 --> 54:57.752
What happened?

55:00.755 --> 55:03.008
He said unspeakable things to me.

55:03.091 --> 55:04.592
Betsy, please, calm down.

55:05.218 --> 55:06.553
It was all in my head.

55:08.555 --> 55:10.473
The whole time, I was making it up.

55:12.183 --> 55:13.935
And I knew it.

55:14.019 --> 55:17.188
Betsy, listen to me. You're all right.

55:17.272 --> 55:19.774
Now just breathe,
and don't let him rob you of your pride.

55:19.858 --> 55:21.276
Do you have a compact or something?

55:21.359 --> 55:23.445
Let's get you cleaned up
and back out there.

55:23.528 --> 55:24.988
No! I can't.

55:25.613 --> 55:28.783
No, I will never even
show my face there again.

55:28.867 --> 55:30.577
-Don't let him do that to you.

55:32.495 --> 55:33.705
Oh, Christ.

55:34.289 --> 55:35.123
Fuck!

55:38.001 --> 55:38.960
Betsy.

55:40.170 --> 55:41.129
Listen to me.

55:43.673 --> 55:45.675
Dr. Hanover is a dope fiend

55:45.759 --> 55:48.511
and a basket case
who doesn't deserve someone like you.

55:49.137 --> 55:51.890
Someone strong and caring and opinionated,

55:51.973 --> 55:53.725
who knows what she wants.

55:54.017 --> 55:56.269
That's what you are, Betsy, a real woman.

55:56.353 --> 55:57.604
Do you have a comb?

55:58.897 --> 56:01.191
That is the only thing you are guilty of.

56:02.400 --> 56:03.485
Now let me do this.

56:03.735 --> 56:07.238
That's why he would want to hurt
someone like you. It's okay.

56:08.114 --> 56:10.450
Because you wake up every morning,

56:10.533 --> 56:14.621
and without even trying,
you are tenacious, clever and wise.

56:14.704 --> 56:17.040
You are a thousand wonderful things that

56:17.123 --> 56:19.876
that walking pile of garbage
will never be, do you hear me?

56:21.044 --> 56:22.462
-You're stunning.

56:26.007 --> 56:27.926
-Can you help her with her lipstick?
-Yes.

56:35.892 --> 56:37.352
What in God's name is wrong with you?

56:37.435 --> 56:40.897
No. I will not speak to you,
I will not listen to you ever again--

56:40.980 --> 56:43.191
Quit your mewling,
you pathetic little child.

56:43.274 --> 56:44.859
You had one task,

56:44.943 --> 56:46.277
and I was very clear.

56:46.861 --> 56:48.780
You only had to do it for one night.

56:50.365 --> 56:52.158
You have destroyed that woman.

56:52.492 --> 56:53.410
I don't care.

56:53.827 --> 56:56.955
From this day forward, you will never
bark another order at me again.

56:57.038 --> 56:59.207
Do you understand? I am your superior!

57:03.461 --> 57:04.712
Of that...

57:05.880 --> 57:07.674
you are very, very mistaken.

57:19.436 --> 57:20.270
Showtime.

58:07.859 --> 58:09.194
Drop the gun!

58:10.612 --> 58:11.446
It's all right.

58:12.197 --> 58:13.656
It's all right, drop the gun.

58:31.174 --> 58:33.635
You're nothing! You're a--

58:34.594 --> 58:35.929
You're nothing!

58:39.182 --> 58:40.642
You're shit!

58:41.893 --> 58:42.769
You're nothing!

58:46.064 --> 58:47.232
You're all--

58:47.315 --> 58:48.691
I am Ondine!

58:51.653 --> 58:52.820
Why did you do that?

58:53.738 --> 58:55.240
Why did you have to shoot her?

58:55.323 --> 58:57.700
She was coming right at us,
I didn't have a choice.

58:57.784 --> 58:59.035
You didn't have to kill her!

59:00.203 --> 59:02.372
You're okay. Stay with me.

59:03.164 --> 59:05.041
Stay with me. Stay with me.

59:06.584 --> 59:09.629
We did it! We're free, we did it.

59:09.712 --> 59:11.130
We'll be paying for that...

59:11.631 --> 59:12.465
someday.

59:13.508 --> 59:14.759
Spill the blood of an innocent,

59:14.842 --> 59:17.136
-you end up paying.
-What about the guard, what did he do?

59:17.220 --> 59:19.013
-The guard was fair game!
-What about Harold?

59:19.097 --> 59:20.265
Quiet down, okay?

59:21.641 --> 59:22.892
We are free, Edmund.

59:44.998 --> 59:46.374
Come out with your hands up!
