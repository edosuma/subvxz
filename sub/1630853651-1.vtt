01:18.750 --> 01:20.875
<i>This is my last chance</i>
<i>to be normal.</i>

01:23.208 --> 01:24.625
<i>You're not normal.</i>

01:26.125 --> 01:27.875
<i>I know that but…</i>

01:28.791 --> 01:30.750
<i>The world don't know that yet.</i>

01:31.250 --> 01:33.666
<i>I don't want to share you</i>
<i>with the world.</i>

02:01.083 --> 02:02.375
<i>What you thinking about?</i>

02:04.875 --> 02:05.958
The future.

02:08.458 --> 02:10.083
What's the future gonna be?

02:12.750 --> 02:13.750
<i>Freedom.</i>

02:27.291 --> 02:29.291
Oh, y'all in here kissing again, huh?

02:29.375 --> 02:30.750
Shut up, Abe.

02:30.833 --> 02:32.916
I told you
to stop climbing through my window,

02:33.000 --> 02:35.458
'cause if Mommy catch you,
I'mma get a beating.

02:35.541 --> 02:37.125
You're the only one she ain't gonna beat.

02:37.208 --> 02:38.833
Mommy slapped
the shit out of me last week.

02:38.916 --> 02:39.916
Oh, yeah.

02:40.416 --> 02:42.541
It's 'cause you told her to go to hell.
You deserved it.

02:43.125 --> 02:45.333
She tells your father
to go to hell all the time.

02:45.416 --> 02:46.958
She's grown. She can do that.

02:47.041 --> 02:48.291
Beauty's grown too.

02:49.583 --> 02:52.125
As long as we live in this house,
we children.

02:52.208 --> 02:53.541
And children must honor…

02:53.625 --> 02:55.666
…thy mother and thy father.

02:55.750 --> 02:57.833
It's in the Bible. You gotta do it.

02:57.916 --> 03:01.708
If we did everything the Bible say,
we'd live in a pretty messed-up world.

03:04.083 --> 03:05.583
Bible is kinda fucked-up.

03:07.875 --> 03:09.375
Hey, Beauty, your voice.

03:10.416 --> 03:12.208
Mmm, I'll be fine.

03:13.083 --> 03:14.125
Switch with me.

03:16.333 --> 03:17.916
Why you always want what I got?

03:18.000 --> 03:19.333
'Cause my nerves are bad.

03:22.750 --> 03:23.583
What?

03:23.666 --> 03:25.833
I don't know why,
you don't do shit.

03:25.916 --> 03:27.833
She ain't never had
a hard day's work in her life.

03:27.916 --> 03:29.666
Mm-mm-mm.

03:29.750 --> 03:32.500
Mommy makes me practice
for six hours a day,

03:32.583 --> 03:34.458
and she yells at me the whole time.

03:34.541 --> 03:35.833
That's work.

03:35.916 --> 03:36.916
That ain't shit.

03:40.000 --> 03:41.833
Both of y'all can shut the fuck up.

03:42.583 --> 03:44.375
You know you love us.

03:51.333 --> 03:52.375
Right now, I don't.

03:52.458 --> 03:54.333
Beauty! Abel!

03:54.416 --> 03:57.166
Get your asses down here right now!
Your father's home!

03:57.250 --> 03:58.250
Shit.

04:01.833 --> 04:03.291
Jas, you could come.

04:03.375 --> 04:06.083
-She ain't call my name.
-Don't worry. I'll protect you.

04:07.291 --> 04:08.500
You always say that,

04:08.583 --> 04:11.000
and when she starts giving me
the evil eye, you don't do shit.

04:27.333 --> 04:29.250
Don't be messin' up my bag, boy.

04:29.333 --> 04:30.208
Yo!

04:31.375 --> 04:32.208
Just bring it in.

04:37.875 --> 04:39.375
What was y'all doing up there?

04:40.541 --> 04:41.500
Nothing.

04:42.458 --> 04:43.541
Mm-hmm.

04:44.541 --> 04:46.541
Go in there and say hello to your daddy.

04:55.541 --> 04:56.541
There she is.

04:56.625 --> 04:58.375
-Hey, Daddy.
-Ah!

04:59.000 --> 05:00.875
-Hey.
-How was your trip?

05:00.958 --> 05:02.375
Mmm, productive.

05:03.208 --> 05:04.250
Look at you.

05:04.333 --> 05:05.583
You look wonderful.

05:06.375 --> 05:07.916
Oh, hey, son.

05:08.000 --> 05:08.875
Hey, Pop.

05:11.875 --> 05:13.250
You smell like reefer, boy.

05:27.041 --> 05:28.958
Why you let him
smoke that cigar in the house?

05:29.041 --> 05:30.333
It's his house.

05:30.416 --> 05:34.250
Look, I don't care if you do it.
Just don't bring it around your sister.

05:35.541 --> 05:36.375
Okay.

05:37.583 --> 05:39.500
You singing in church
or something?

05:39.583 --> 05:41.291
Jesus all right with me.

05:41.375 --> 05:42.750
What's going on? Tell me.

05:46.375 --> 05:48.000
-You all right, Mama?
-Hey.

05:55.208 --> 05:56.166
No, I got it!

05:58.625 --> 06:00.166
I was just trying to help.

06:00.250 --> 06:01.625
I don't need your help.

06:07.791 --> 06:09.208
I got something for you.

06:13.958 --> 06:15.208
Look at that. Do you like it?

06:15.291 --> 06:17.083
-It's beautiful.
-Mmm.

06:17.583 --> 06:20.416
Take it out. Let me put it on you.
You just pull that.

06:24.041 --> 06:25.791
Yeah, okay. Hold on.

06:26.416 --> 06:29.875
This you must always wear

06:30.458 --> 06:32.208
in honor of God's love for you.

06:32.291 --> 06:34.125
Turn around. Let me put this on you.

06:35.041 --> 06:38.125
This will affirm your faith,
keep you safe,

06:38.750 --> 06:42.541
and always keep you understanding…

06:42.625 --> 06:45.291
<i>…that God loves you as His own.</i>

06:45.375 --> 06:46.208
<i>Let me see.</i>

06:47.458 --> 06:49.791
<i>Oh, beautiful, radiant,</i>

06:49.875 --> 06:51.625
<i>shining.</i>

06:51.708 --> 06:54.875
<i>Always wear this.</i>
<i>It'll protect you, keep you safe.</i>

06:54.958 --> 06:59.041
<i>Always wear this. Always…</i>
<i>It'll protect you. </i>

06:59.125 --> 07:00.333
<i>Always wear this.</i>

07:07.458 --> 07:08.375
Mm-hmm.

07:09.000 --> 07:10.500
How come you didn't bring me nothing?

07:11.291 --> 07:13.166
'Cause you don't deserve nothing.

07:14.708 --> 07:15.833
What you laughing at?

07:16.333 --> 07:17.416
You, nigga.

07:21.791 --> 07:23.041
So,

07:24.458 --> 07:25.875
Mama made your favorite.

07:27.000 --> 07:28.291
Hot dogs?

07:28.375 --> 07:30.708
-I thought you liked--
-Get them bags upstairs, boy.

07:31.708 --> 07:34.125
You lucky Beauty was here.
I was about to drop your ass.

07:34.208 --> 07:35.541
Shut your dumb ass up.

07:38.125 --> 07:41.375
Nigga, you wasn't about to do shit.
Beauty just saved your life.

07:41.458 --> 07:43.166
I'm sick of his ass
always trying to punk me.

07:43.250 --> 07:45.416
He just mad
'cause he ain't cute like y'all.

07:45.500 --> 07:47.041
Ain't my fault he got a ugly daddy.

07:47.125 --> 07:49.125
Do not say that
about your brother.

08:02.666 --> 08:05.416
You're never going to convince me

08:05.500 --> 08:08.541
that in order to live,
I gotta eat something dead.

08:08.625 --> 08:11.125
You ain't gonna convince me.
It's not gonna happen.

08:11.208 --> 08:13.833
I heard
you shut the place down last night.

08:15.041 --> 08:17.041
Wanted to see if you got what it takes.

08:18.458 --> 08:19.416
I guess I do.

08:19.500 --> 08:21.083
I could've told you that.

08:21.166 --> 08:22.875
Still can't hold a candle to me, though.

08:22.958 --> 08:24.875
I know that's right, Mama.

08:24.958 --> 08:26.583
Nobody can hold a candle to you.

08:27.333 --> 08:28.625
You can.

08:33.291 --> 08:35.958
If the student
is not as good as the teacher,

08:37.083 --> 08:39.083
then the teacher's not doing a good job.

08:39.166 --> 08:42.833
Well, you have done
a wonderful job teaching her, honey.

08:44.041 --> 08:45.708
She still got some work to do.

08:45.791 --> 08:47.000
Says who?

08:47.083 --> 08:48.000
Says me.

08:50.583 --> 08:51.958
I think she ready for the big time.

08:53.333 --> 08:54.333
Of course you do.

08:56.250 --> 08:59.125
Don't speak at my table
unless I ask you a question.

09:00.416 --> 09:03.500
-I don't need permission to speak.
-When you're in my house, you do.

09:07.208 --> 09:09.666
-Then I'll leave.
-Yeah! Get the fuck out!

09:09.750 --> 09:12.208
Beauty, let her go. Don't need
this devil worshipper in my home.

09:12.291 --> 09:14.333
-I don't worship no devil.
-You don't worship God.

09:15.041 --> 09:16.166
Neither do you.

09:17.291 --> 09:18.375
Daddy, please.

09:20.083 --> 09:21.875
Can we all just calm down?

09:21.958 --> 09:23.583
We are having
a family discussion,

09:23.666 --> 09:26.916
and last time I checked,
you aren't part of this family.

09:27.833 --> 09:29.958
-Maybe one day I will be.
-What you gonna do?

09:30.041 --> 09:32.000
-Marry one of her brothers?

09:32.083 --> 09:34.416
I wouldn't touch that thing
with a ten-foot pole.

09:34.500 --> 09:36.375
-Cain, stop it.
-Come on, Jas.

09:36.458 --> 09:39.166
Let's run away and get married
and never come back.

09:39.833 --> 09:42.166
You think marriage is a joke? Huh?

09:42.875 --> 09:43.791
Do you?

09:44.416 --> 09:48.500
"For this reason,
a man leaves his mother and father

09:48.583 --> 09:50.833
and unites with his wife to become one."

09:50.916 --> 09:52.916
Not two but one flesh.

09:54.250 --> 09:56.541
"That that God brings together,

09:57.041 --> 09:58.583
let no man sever."

09:59.333 --> 10:00.625
Amen.

10:02.916 --> 10:04.208
Is that what you believe?

10:05.625 --> 10:07.500
That you're one flesh with your wife?

10:08.875 --> 10:10.541
That you only have eyes for her?

10:29.583 --> 10:32.208
Cain, would you take my plate,
please, son?

10:36.041 --> 10:37.333
We're having dinner.

10:38.208 --> 10:41.333
Oh, well, your husband
asked me to come by around six.

10:42.041 --> 10:43.375
It's 5:45.

10:43.458 --> 10:45.458
-Yeah, I'm done with that.

10:45.541 --> 10:46.625
Is that her again?

10:47.291 --> 10:48.333
Mm-hmm.

10:49.166 --> 10:52.000
-Why you leave her on the doorstep?
-I don't want her up in my damn house.

10:52.083 --> 10:53.500
Let's hear the woman out.

10:53.583 --> 10:56.125
I don't need to hear her out
to know she full of shit.

10:57.708 --> 10:59.333
Then I'mma talk to her myself.

10:59.416 --> 11:01.250
You can't make
a decision like that without me!

11:01.333 --> 11:04.541
I'mma ask the woman in
if that's all right with you.

11:17.291 --> 11:18.375
Thank you.

11:18.458 --> 11:19.583
My pleasure.

11:26.375 --> 11:27.208
Well,

11:28.250 --> 11:29.416
she's got it.

11:30.583 --> 11:32.958
Got the guts of Aretha,

11:33.041 --> 11:36.125
and… beauty of Lena,

11:36.208 --> 11:38.125
soul of Billie, the--

11:38.208 --> 11:40.625
Voice, my voice.

11:42.916 --> 11:45.041
Yes, she does. You taught her well.

11:45.125 --> 11:46.375
Let the woman talk.

11:48.958 --> 11:51.000
The torch has to be passed to someone,

11:51.083 --> 11:54.041
and I believe
that someone is your daughter.

11:55.458 --> 11:58.041
That's the same thing
she said to me ten years ago.

11:58.125 --> 11:59.916
And I was telling the truth.

12:00.000 --> 12:02.916
It's just that
I think you were ahead of your time.

12:03.000 --> 12:04.250
And Beauty's not?

12:04.750 --> 12:07.916
No. Beauty is right on schedule.

12:11.083 --> 12:12.541
It's easy.

12:12.625 --> 12:15.583
<i>A blind man could tell you</i>
<i>she's going places.</i>

12:15.666 --> 12:18.125
<i>It takes somebody who knows what to do…</i>

12:18.208 --> 12:20.625
<i>I can</i> <i>shape that</i>
<i>to make something out of that…</i>

12:20.708 --> 12:22.625
<i>I can bring people to the table…</i>

12:24.500 --> 12:28.666
…so that everyone in America
is gonna want a piece of her.

12:30.958 --> 12:33.791
And she can make you
a whole lot of money, can't she?

12:33.875 --> 12:36.541
<i> We can agree</i>
<i>to work together on this.</i>

12:37.083 --> 12:40.625
<i>I can promise you you're never gonna have</i>
<i>to work again for the rest of your life.</i>

12:40.708 --> 12:43.375
<i> And if everybody gets a piece,</i>

12:43.458 --> 12:44.916
<i>won't be nothing left.</i>

12:47.208 --> 12:49.333
-This is about Beauty.
-I know that.

12:49.833 --> 12:51.416
And I want what's best for her.

12:51.500 --> 12:53.625
You want
what's best for your bank account.

12:55.041 --> 12:57.958
Don't make me smack you
in front of this white woman.

13:10.416 --> 13:11.625
Should I step out?

13:11.708 --> 13:13.041
Give you two a minute?

13:13.958 --> 13:14.833
Please.

13:20.083 --> 13:21.333
What can I do

13:22.041 --> 13:25.291
to make you know that I have
Beauty's best interests at heart?

13:25.375 --> 13:26.458
You can wait.

13:26.541 --> 13:27.666
A few more years.

13:27.750 --> 13:28.708
I'm ready now.

13:28.791 --> 13:31.208
You don't know what's out there.

13:31.291 --> 13:34.291
The… the record industry is the devil,

13:34.833 --> 13:37.791
and he's just waiting to swallow you up.

13:37.875 --> 13:39.375
I won't let him.

13:40.250 --> 13:42.875
Do you know
what they do to stars, huh?

13:43.416 --> 13:46.583
They build you up
just so they can tear you down.

13:48.625 --> 13:51.500
Can't nobody tear me down, Mommy.

13:53.750 --> 13:55.750
You taught me to keep my head high

13:57.041 --> 13:58.750
and to put God first.

14:00.833 --> 14:02.250
Go to your damn room.

14:02.333 --> 14:03.250
Why?

14:04.083 --> 14:07.708
Go to your room or be dragged.

14:08.708 --> 14:09.791
It's your choice.

14:11.250 --> 14:12.500
Listen to your mama.

14:14.916 --> 14:15.750
Go!

14:16.916 --> 14:17.875
Go on, now.

14:34.541 --> 14:35.666
She ain't ready.

14:36.541 --> 14:37.500
Trust me.

14:39.583 --> 14:40.791
She's ready.

15:28.625 --> 15:29.458
No.

15:43.541 --> 15:48.000
I am not sending her out in the world
to be eaten by wolves.

15:49.791 --> 15:53.166
<i> How you know that she not a wolf?</i>

16:02.458 --> 16:04.291
'Cause she came out of my body.

16:06.375 --> 16:07.208
Okay.

16:08.041 --> 16:10.250
That's gonna work.

16:10.333 --> 16:11.541
That's gonna work.

16:12.250 --> 16:13.083
Yeah.

16:14.875 --> 16:16.833
-Hey, Daddy.
-Hey, daughter.

16:17.375 --> 16:18.875
Can you hand me that rag over there?

16:25.166 --> 16:26.583
What you doing up so early?

16:27.208 --> 16:28.208
I couldn't sleep.

16:28.291 --> 16:29.125
Ah.

16:30.500 --> 16:32.625
For sure, you got a lot on your mind.

16:32.708 --> 16:34.708
Hey, get in the car. Try to turn it on.

16:45.708 --> 16:47.416
You in the driver seat now.

16:49.125 --> 16:51.125
Move over. I'll take it from here.

16:54.958 --> 16:55.875
Okay.

16:57.916 --> 16:59.416
Cross our fingers, right?

17:02.708 --> 17:03.625
Ha!

17:08.083 --> 17:09.416
Put your seat belt on.

17:22.833 --> 17:25.416
Now, where you wanna go?

17:27.208 --> 17:28.041
Everywhere.

17:30.666 --> 17:31.583
All right.

17:33.708 --> 17:35.708
You really think I'm gon' make it?

17:37.083 --> 17:39.583
I think that
you're gonna give people hope.

17:42.916 --> 17:47.000
God, I can't help but look at you
and still see my little girl.

17:47.625 --> 17:50.125
I just wish I could hold on to you
a little bit longer.

17:51.125 --> 17:52.708
I'm not going anywhere.

17:53.833 --> 17:57.041
When you sign that contract,
everything's gonna change.

17:59.625 --> 18:01.458
Watching you sign that contract

18:02.875 --> 18:05.250
probably be
the hardest thing I ever have to do.

18:06.958 --> 18:09.583
It's not easy for a father…

18:09.666 --> 18:12.208
…to send his little girl out
into the world.

18:13.416 --> 18:14.958
Maybe I shouldn't sign it.

18:19.458 --> 18:20.541
You will.

18:20.625 --> 18:21.708
Jasmine and I were talking--

18:21.791 --> 18:23.125
She's not your family.

18:24.041 --> 18:25.000
I am.

18:26.416 --> 18:28.125
You don't sign that contract,

18:29.333 --> 18:31.583
you're gonna regret it
the rest of your life.

18:33.625 --> 18:37.291
You are destined for greatness.

18:38.458 --> 18:39.750
And Mommy wasn't?

18:40.750 --> 18:41.708
Uh…

18:41.791 --> 18:44.416
Well, sometimes
greatness skips a generation.

19:17.625 --> 19:19.166
Why you let him do that?

19:19.250 --> 19:20.166
Do what?

19:21.083 --> 19:22.208
Run your life.

19:23.791 --> 19:25.416
My father gave me life.

19:26.041 --> 19:27.500
I have to be respectful.

19:29.375 --> 19:30.416
No, you don't.

19:31.250 --> 19:32.250
How about this?

19:32.875 --> 19:35.250
You live your life, and I'll live mine.

19:36.708 --> 19:38.333
You really think you can trust him?

19:38.416 --> 19:39.708
Of course I can.

19:40.375 --> 19:41.333
He's my father.

19:41.833 --> 19:43.375
Whatcha need?

19:43.458 --> 19:46.083
Just 'cause he's your father
doesn't mean he's trustworthy.

19:47.500 --> 19:49.583
You gonna sign the contract or not?

19:50.833 --> 19:51.958
I think so.

19:58.250 --> 19:59.250
I'm scared.

20:01.583 --> 20:02.458
Of what?

20:04.041 --> 20:05.583
What's gonna happen to us?

20:06.666 --> 20:09.166
Your life's gonna get real big real fast.

20:10.250 --> 20:12.708
It's gonna be like
a freight train you can't stop.

20:13.208 --> 20:15.541
Yeah, but you'll be on that train with me.

20:15.625 --> 20:17.041
What if I want my own train?

20:17.125 --> 20:18.833
My train will be a lot nicer.

20:19.833 --> 20:21.750
-Whatever.

20:49.375 --> 20:52.500
-I don't got no money.
-It's on the house.

20:53.083 --> 20:54.958
How come you never give me no free shit?

20:55.041 --> 20:56.500
She prettier than you.

21:00.583 --> 21:01.708
See ya.

21:03.541 --> 21:04.500
<i>That's all you get.</i>

21:04.583 --> 21:06.458
Stop. Stop it.

21:06.541 --> 21:08.875
Is that your way of giving God praise?

21:09.375 --> 21:10.541
Is it?

21:10.625 --> 21:13.041
You are not singing from your gut.

21:15.083 --> 21:18.583
-I'm trying.
-Y… y'all hear me do it every Sunday.

21:19.625 --> 21:21.083
I… I'll try again.

21:21.166 --> 21:23.375
No, you won't, 'cause I done had enough.

21:24.125 --> 21:25.166
I haven't.

21:26.000 --> 21:27.125
And stop talking back.

21:27.750 --> 21:28.875
I'll try again.

21:30.666 --> 21:32.000
I swear to God.

21:53.208 --> 21:54.166
Sit down.

21:59.250 --> 22:02.791
<i>You are way too pretty</i>
<i>and way too talented</i>

22:02.875 --> 22:06.833
<i>to walk out on a national stage</i>
<i>and not be noticed.</i>

22:08.708 --> 22:10.833
<i> I just wanna use</i>
<i>the gift God gave me.</i>

22:12.500 --> 22:14.333
<i>Everybody's gonna love you,</i>

22:14.416 --> 22:15.958
<i>but you won't be real.</i>

22:17.208 --> 22:18.500
<i>You'll be a fantasy.</i>

22:20.333 --> 22:23.416
<i>People can fantasize about me</i>
<i>all they want.</i>

22:24.500 --> 22:26.750
<i>It's way too much to live up to.</i>

22:28.791 --> 22:29.916
<i> I'll be fine.</i>

22:34.708 --> 22:39.458
I have sung behind people my whole life.

22:41.041 --> 22:43.208
Never had the spotlight on my face.

22:46.416 --> 22:49.625
But I've been close enough
to see 'em get burned by it.

22:51.500 --> 22:53.583
It ain't all it's cracked up to be.

22:54.666 --> 22:55.833
I'll be careful.

22:56.958 --> 22:59.250
It's not about you being careful.

22:59.875 --> 23:00.791
Okay?

23:00.875 --> 23:04.125
It's about you
having to be something you not.

23:05.041 --> 23:06.416
What's wrong with that?

23:07.541 --> 23:09.916
You can't spend
the rest of your life

23:10.000 --> 23:11.666
trying to be something else.

23:12.208 --> 23:14.875
You will end up
forgetting who you really are.

23:19.291 --> 23:20.875
That won't happen to me.

23:23.208 --> 23:24.166
I promise.

23:25.083 --> 23:26.916
You think I don't know who you are?

23:27.416 --> 23:28.541
Hmm?

23:29.583 --> 23:31.208
What are you talking about?

23:35.458 --> 23:37.333
A mother knows her child.

23:43.291 --> 23:46.208
Folk gon' wanna know
who you laying with, Beauty.

23:47.958 --> 23:51.416
-And that's none of their business.
-And that ain't how none of this work.

23:53.500 --> 23:56.833
Just 'cause it didn't work out for you
doesn't mean it won't work out for me.

23:57.875 --> 23:59.000
What did you say?

24:03.208 --> 24:04.125
Nothing.

24:07.666 --> 24:10.625
You are sheltered, and you're spoiled.

24:10.708 --> 24:11.833
Spoiled?

24:12.416 --> 24:13.958
We ain't got no money.

24:14.041 --> 24:17.916
We have spent our whole lives
trying to protect you.

24:19.875 --> 24:23.666
When you walk out on that stage,
we can't come with you.

24:24.166 --> 24:25.375
I don't want you to.

24:26.125 --> 24:27.625
So who gonna do it, then?

24:28.458 --> 24:29.458
Jasmine?

24:30.291 --> 24:31.166
Yeah.

24:34.125 --> 24:36.000
The world ain't ready for that.

24:38.041 --> 24:39.166
Ready for what?

24:39.666 --> 24:41.750
We're friends. That's it.

24:42.500 --> 24:46.000
-I don't sleep in a bed with my friends.
-That's because God's your only friend.

24:52.833 --> 24:54.208
I'm sorry, Mommy.

24:56.166 --> 24:57.708
You should be.

24:59.666 --> 25:01.041
Let me tell you something.

25:01.125 --> 25:05.208
Life, life is about balance, Beauty.

25:05.958 --> 25:07.875
For every good thing you get,

25:09.583 --> 25:12.333
something bad…
something bad is gonna happen.

25:17.083 --> 25:18.208
Go wash your face.

27:11.958 --> 27:12.833
What's wrong?

27:21.875 --> 27:22.750
It's okay.

27:23.416 --> 27:24.833
It's okay. Just breathe.

27:27.708 --> 27:29.375
-<i> Way up.</i>

27:30.625 --> 27:31.666
What happened?

27:45.208 --> 27:47.416
It's okay
if I'm not with you on that train.

27:49.708 --> 27:50.750
No, it's not.

27:51.958 --> 27:52.958
I need you.

27:55.166 --> 27:56.291
You can handle it.

28:01.416 --> 28:03.291
Can't always get everything you want.

28:04.208 --> 28:05.125
Why not?

28:07.166 --> 28:09.083
'Cause that's not how the world works.

28:20.583 --> 28:23.166
You don't think
I should sign that contract, do you?

28:26.416 --> 28:29.083
I don't think your father's
the only one that should be looking at it.

28:29.583 --> 28:30.916
I don't have a choice.

28:33.166 --> 28:34.166
Yes, you do.

28:36.125 --> 28:37.500
Who's gonna look at it?

28:38.125 --> 28:39.041
My mom?

28:40.791 --> 28:43.166
-Find a lawyer.
-I don't know how to do that.

28:43.250 --> 28:44.500
I can help you.

28:54.458 --> 28:56.958
I'll always be here to protect you.

29:04.125 --> 29:05.083
Always.

29:19.083 --> 29:20.208
You promise?

29:24.750 --> 29:25.750
I promise.

31:20.166 --> 31:21.250
<i>Yes.</i>

31:21.333 --> 31:23.458
<i>I woke up this morning. I had no doubts.</i>

31:23.541 --> 31:25.125
<i>How many of y'all had doubts?</i>

31:25.833 --> 31:27.583
<i>Well, we gonna clear that up right now.</i>

31:29.125 --> 31:31.458
All right now. How you doing, sister?

31:33.541 --> 31:35.750
Give it up
for this beautiful choir, y'all!

31:43.125 --> 31:44.916
Ain't God good? Yes.

31:49.916 --> 31:51.458
Hey, hey.

31:51.541 --> 31:55.166
Stand up if you love Him.
Stand up if you love Him!

31:55.250 --> 31:57.583
<i>Up! Up! Up!</i>

31:57.666 --> 31:59.833
Yes! Yes!

32:01.583 --> 32:03.958
All right, y'all.
I have no doubts.

32:04.458 --> 32:06.041
How ya doing, sister?

32:06.125 --> 32:07.208
-Yes!
-Yes.

32:10.500 --> 32:11.500
Yes!

32:20.125 --> 32:22.333
Hey,
help me remember ya right here.

32:22.416 --> 32:24.916
Shout for Jesus.
Raise your hands for Jesus.

32:25.500 --> 32:27.166
I see some smiles in here.

32:34.250 --> 32:35.875
Hey! Clap your hands!

32:36.375 --> 32:39.625
Hands! Yes! Yeah, sister.

32:39.708 --> 32:41.208
You got the pearls on today.

32:41.708 --> 32:43.000
I see you, sister.

32:43.541 --> 32:44.375
Yes!

32:50.875 --> 32:52.458
Yes! Yes!

32:52.541 --> 32:54.416
Oh! Whoo!

33:09.583 --> 33:11.375
Can I take a break?

33:20.125 --> 33:22.708
We're all excited
until the bottom drops out, right?

33:22.791 --> 33:24.166
-Yes.
-She said it.

33:24.250 --> 33:27.333
We all waiting here.
She's gonna just take that pen

33:27.416 --> 33:29.166
and sign on page three.

33:29.250 --> 33:31.500
-Who's we?
-We your security.

33:31.583 --> 33:33.291
-She said it.

33:33.375 --> 33:34.458
Moment of truth.

33:35.083 --> 33:36.583
Beauty, whatcha gonna do?

33:39.458 --> 33:41.041
I want my lawyer to look at it.

33:41.125 --> 33:42.666
Oh, Beauty.

33:43.583 --> 33:47.625
Your dad and I have looked
that contract over a million times.

33:48.541 --> 33:49.666
Great.

33:50.208 --> 33:52.083
Now my lawyer could go over it again.

33:52.708 --> 33:54.125
What you need with a lawyer?

33:54.625 --> 33:56.583
Jasmine thought I should get one.

33:59.166 --> 34:02.958
What you doing? Come over here.
Get up. Come on, now. Right now!

34:04.666 --> 34:06.166
What the hell you think you're doing?

34:06.666 --> 34:08.375
I'm just looking out for myself.

34:08.458 --> 34:10.000
Don't fuck with my money!

34:11.333 --> 34:13.333
That's what this is about for you.

34:14.208 --> 34:15.041
Money.

34:15.125 --> 34:16.750
This is about your future.

34:16.833 --> 34:17.833
Exactly.

34:19.458 --> 34:21.875
And I wanna make sure I have a say in it.

34:22.583 --> 34:23.583
This ain't you.

34:24.416 --> 34:25.375
This is her.

34:26.208 --> 34:30.208
-You know she has a name.
-I don't give a shit what her name is.

34:30.291 --> 34:33.500
I am your father,
and you're not gonna disrespect me.

34:35.125 --> 34:37.083
I'm not trying to disrespect you.

34:37.625 --> 34:39.291
I wanna make sure
I'm doing the right thing.

34:39.375 --> 34:43.583
If you don't sign that contract now,

34:43.666 --> 34:47.958
I'mma put your shit on the front lawn,
and you can fend for yourself.

34:49.541 --> 34:53.375
After all I done for you,
this is how you repay me?

34:53.458 --> 34:55.208
I never thought I'd see the day

34:55.291 --> 34:58.625
when my own daughter
thinks I'm trying to steal from her.

34:59.625 --> 35:01.166
Daddy, I don't think that.

35:02.666 --> 35:04.083
Is that what she thinks?

35:04.166 --> 35:05.166
I don't know.

35:06.250 --> 35:08.166
Well, you better figure it out, honey.

35:09.208 --> 35:11.208
You better make a decision fast

35:11.750 --> 35:15.958
because we worked too hard to get here
for you to throw it all away.

35:30.625 --> 35:32.666
Okay, gonna be a big star.

35:32.750 --> 35:33.625
I know.

35:34.208 --> 35:35.583
Confidence is good.

35:37.166 --> 35:39.458
Three, two, one.

35:41.375 --> 35:42.666
Yes!

35:42.750 --> 35:43.625
All righty.

35:43.708 --> 35:45.500
-Wow!

35:45.583 --> 35:48.708
-Right.
-Congratulations.

35:48.791 --> 35:49.750
Congratulations.

35:50.291 --> 35:53.125
-We did it.
-I think we did it together.

35:54.875 --> 35:57.958
And I'm gonna be there for you
every step of the way.

36:00.958 --> 36:04.208
Are you really happy for me, Mommy?

36:05.416 --> 36:06.458
Of course.

36:07.333 --> 36:08.958
Of course, I-- Baby.

36:15.375 --> 36:16.375
I'm so proud.

38:01.958 --> 38:02.958
What's wrong?

38:03.041 --> 38:04.833
Why your face lookin' so long?

38:06.000 --> 38:07.875
I can't find Jasmine.

38:07.958 --> 38:09.625
What you mean you can't find her?

38:10.208 --> 38:12.791
I called her house three times,
and no one answered.

38:12.875 --> 38:15.541
And then I went over there,
and her mom said she wasn't home.

38:15.625 --> 38:18.458
Okay, well, I'm sure she's fine.
She'll turn up.

38:18.541 --> 38:20.875
Why don't you come downstairs with us
and have a drink?

38:20.958 --> 38:22.916
Your brothers is already down there drunk.

38:23.000 --> 38:24.500
Nah, I'm good.

38:30.791 --> 38:31.625
Okay.

38:35.625 --> 38:36.916
Are you happy?

38:41.708 --> 38:43.041
You make me happy.

39:17.833 --> 39:19.083
You okay, Pop?

39:20.291 --> 39:21.208
Yeah.

39:22.208 --> 39:23.541
Yeah, I'm fine.

39:27.166 --> 39:28.416
I was wondering…

39:32.291 --> 39:35.083
what kind of man you are.

39:42.166 --> 39:43.125
Same as you.

39:43.208 --> 39:44.750
Hmm. Is that right?

39:45.375 --> 39:47.583
-Yeah.
-He ain't shit.

39:47.666 --> 39:48.916
Fuck you, Abe.

39:50.125 --> 39:54.583
I could tell you
what kind of man Abe won't be.

39:55.125 --> 39:56.041
Here we go.

39:57.708 --> 39:59.500
He…

39:59.583 --> 40:00.791
He ain't gon' be shit.

40:04.958 --> 40:07.125
Yeah,
he living the life right now.

40:08.416 --> 40:11.875
'Cause he got my good looks
and his mother's charm.

40:12.833 --> 40:14.000
But truth is…

40:16.000 --> 40:17.041
he's simple.

40:18.125 --> 40:19.166
You know why?

40:21.208 --> 40:26.083
'Cause everything been handed to him.

40:27.500 --> 40:31.750
That's why he always walk around
with that stupid look on his face.

40:37.333 --> 40:38.583
But it'll go away.

40:41.291 --> 40:42.458
All of it will.

40:48.708 --> 40:51.166
He better appreciate this time

40:52.625 --> 40:56.041
now 'cause as he gets older,
his looks will fade,

40:56.125 --> 40:58.416
as will his ability
to talk women out their panties.

40:58.500 --> 41:02.666
And he would be sad and miserable.

41:03.958 --> 41:05.833
His wife will be bored,

41:05.916 --> 41:09.083
and his children will only love him

41:09.166 --> 41:11.041
because he is their father.

41:11.125 --> 41:13.458
And when he dies,

41:13.541 --> 41:17.000
nobody will remember his name.

41:17.750 --> 41:19.458
Not even his children

41:19.541 --> 41:23.625
will feel compelled
to keep his memory alive.

41:26.583 --> 41:27.500
Fuck you too, Pop.

41:32.291 --> 41:33.583
Yeah, got his ass.

41:33.666 --> 41:34.541
Right?

41:34.625 --> 41:35.458
I got his…

41:40.916 --> 41:41.916
What a… Wait.

41:42.541 --> 41:43.791
What about me, Pop?

41:44.791 --> 41:46.291
I can't tell your future.

41:47.708 --> 41:48.958
Boy.

41:49.041 --> 41:49.875
Why not?

41:49.958 --> 41:52.041
'Cause I wasn't there when you conceived.

41:52.125 --> 41:55.375
-But you was there when I was born.
-Yeah. Not the same.

41:58.166 --> 42:00.041
I'm still trying to figure you out.

42:01.875 --> 42:03.375
Well, what you need to know?

42:11.833 --> 42:12.750
I need to know…

42:15.166 --> 42:16.875
if you'd do something for me.

42:18.041 --> 42:20.041
I'd do anything for you, Pop.

42:21.083 --> 42:22.041
Anything?

42:23.208 --> 42:24.166
Yes, sir.

42:27.541 --> 42:29.041
What you need me to do?

42:33.375 --> 42:35.916
Make her go away.

42:43.250 --> 42:45.458
The fuck you mean "make her go away"?

42:45.541 --> 42:46.916
This don't concern you.

42:48.125 --> 42:49.458
Unless you wanna help.

43:04.208 --> 43:07.541
Show me what kind of man you are.

43:10.250 --> 43:12.000
-I got you.

43:17.000 --> 43:18.208
Be right back, Mama.

43:18.958 --> 43:20.000
Where y'all going?

43:20.083 --> 43:21.833
Me and Abe just 'bout
to go for a ride.

43:21.916 --> 43:23.250
I ain't going nowhere.

43:23.333 --> 43:25.250
Get your ass in the fucking car.

43:30.375 --> 43:31.750
Y'all be careful.

43:43.083 --> 43:44.083
Hmm.

45:03.583 --> 45:04.541
Where we going?

45:05.041 --> 45:07.625
-I'll tell you when we get there.
-Fuck that. Tell me now.

45:08.125 --> 45:10.750
-Just relax.
-Nigga, don't tell me to relax.

45:14.833 --> 45:16.958
I ain't got nothing against Jasmine.

45:17.958 --> 45:19.125
She a nice girl.

45:21.208 --> 45:23.166
If Beauty want a lady friend,
that's her business.

45:23.250 --> 45:25.041
It ain't got nothing to do with us.

45:25.125 --> 45:27.708
-It's got everything to do with us.
-It's her life.

45:29.916 --> 45:30.791
Listen.

45:31.666 --> 45:34.291
We can't have evil people
hanging around our sister.

45:34.958 --> 45:36.625
We supposed to protect her.

45:38.208 --> 45:39.666
Jasmine ain't evil.

45:46.500 --> 45:47.333
Man.

45:48.166 --> 45:49.791
You're too young to understand.

45:53.083 --> 45:54.375
So I'm young now?

45:57.333 --> 45:58.458
Yeah, Abe.

45:59.166 --> 46:00.166
You are.

46:01.708 --> 46:03.708
You always been young acting.

46:05.041 --> 46:06.166
You need to man the fuck up!

46:25.625 --> 46:27.666
-Get your ass out!
-You really wanna fuckin' fight me?

46:27.750 --> 46:29.250
Come out before I drag your ass out.

46:30.166 --> 46:31.750
-Come here!
-It's not about you!

46:33.000 --> 46:34.625
What? Try and hit me again!

46:38.333 --> 46:40.666
Come here!
You run like a girl, motherfucker!

47:29.583 --> 47:32.083
-Where's your girl?

47:32.166 --> 47:33.583
What you mean, man?

47:34.166 --> 47:35.291
Your Siamese twin.

47:35.875 --> 47:38.250
I don't think
I've seen you in here without her.

47:41.583 --> 47:45.583
Yeah, well, I… I can be alone sometimes.

47:45.666 --> 47:47.916
I see.

47:49.041 --> 47:51.125
You know, I got some shit if you want it.

47:53.541 --> 47:56.291
Yeah, that's not really my thing.
It's Beauty's.

47:57.708 --> 47:59.916
Well, maybe you could gift it to her.

48:01.500 --> 48:03.291
Come on, my dude.
That ain't no gift.

48:03.375 --> 48:05.375
It would be if you gave it to her.

48:09.416 --> 48:10.250
Um…

48:11.250 --> 48:12.375
Meet me out back.

48:15.791 --> 48:18.208
-Meet you where?
-Out back. Come on.

48:19.041 --> 48:20.875
Okay.

48:28.166 --> 48:31.083
Yeah…
Right over here. I got you.

48:31.708 --> 48:33.375
I told you I got you. Come on.

48:33.916 --> 48:35.083
All right.

48:36.416 --> 48:37.333
Come on.

49:13.750 --> 49:15.083
My son do that?

49:19.416 --> 49:21.250
You ain't got nothing to say to me, boy?

49:22.916 --> 49:25.375
You, who are just like me?

49:31.625 --> 49:32.916
Now we can move on.

49:33.791 --> 49:35.666
You couldn't do that shit, boy.

49:38.791 --> 49:41.416
Just like everything else I ask you to do.

50:19.041 --> 50:21.000
We just gotta get out of here.

50:27.583 --> 50:29.000
I can't go with you.

50:32.958 --> 50:34.166
Don't say that.

50:38.166 --> 50:40.000
We can't keep doing this.

50:40.875 --> 50:41.916
Doin' what?

50:45.416 --> 50:46.916
Whatever this is.

50:49.583 --> 50:50.416
Done.

50:55.250 --> 50:57.375
You live your life, I'll live mine.

50:59.833 --> 51:01.541
You… you don't mean that.

51:03.875 --> 51:04.791
No, I do.

51:10.708 --> 51:11.958
I love you.

51:18.375 --> 51:19.416
Yeah, I know.

51:23.666 --> 51:25.333
You don't love me anymore?

51:26.541 --> 51:27.916
I didn't say that.

51:32.666 --> 51:34.458
Why didn't you say it back?

51:41.291 --> 51:42.916
'Cause I want you to leave.

53:21.375 --> 53:22.458
You like it?

53:23.708 --> 53:24.791
I love it.

53:29.583 --> 53:31.791
We finally have
a place of our own.

54:25.291 --> 54:27.875
Ah shit.

56:18.416 --> 56:19.791
What do you say

56:19.875 --> 56:24.000
to the criticism you've been getting
from your Black audience?

56:24.083 --> 56:25.291
What you mean?

56:26.250 --> 56:30.958
Well, some people say
that you're pandering to a white audience

56:31.500 --> 56:34.583
and that you don't want
your music to sound too

56:35.708 --> 56:36.875
"soulful."

56:36.958 --> 56:38.791
Is that your plan?

56:38.875 --> 56:41.666
-Stay in character.
-No, I'm asking you a question.

56:42.208 --> 56:43.625
Is that your plan?

56:43.708 --> 56:44.541
No.

56:45.250 --> 56:46.291
Oh no.

56:47.125 --> 56:52.000
No, we… we are gonna first appeal
to the urban audience.

56:52.083 --> 56:53.791
What you mean "first"?

56:53.875 --> 56:56.958
Well, we're gonna choose a song

56:57.041 --> 56:59.625
that Black women are going to love.

57:00.166 --> 57:04.916
Also, that white teenage girls
are gonna go crazy over

57:05.000 --> 57:07.375
and play over and over and over again.

57:08.083 --> 57:11.250
That way,
you'll get both sides of the market.

57:11.791 --> 57:13.000
And if you do that,

57:13.500 --> 57:15.708
you will be an icon.

57:17.500 --> 57:18.416
Trust me.

57:20.916 --> 57:24.333
Now, I'd like you
to answer the question that I ask you,

57:24.416 --> 57:27.083
and I'd like you
to do it in proper English.

57:31.625 --> 57:34.750
I… I don't know how
to sing in Black, white…

57:37.583 --> 57:41.458
I just know how to sing,
because that's what I like to do.

57:45.125 --> 57:45.958
Good.

57:47.958 --> 57:48.791
All right.

57:53.333 --> 57:56.208
You have
a lot of love songs on your album.

57:57.416 --> 57:59.458
When you're singing those songs,

58:00.375 --> 58:02.041
who are you singing them to?

58:03.625 --> 58:04.625
Everybody.

58:19.333 --> 58:21.041
Let's just go with the answer we prepared.

58:21.125 --> 58:23.166
Why do I have to do this?

58:23.250 --> 58:28.083
Because you cannot just be a singing star.

58:28.166 --> 58:32.125
You, Beauty, have to be the whole package.

58:38.375 --> 58:40.208
There are a lot of little…

58:41.541 --> 58:42.916
little girls

58:43.666 --> 58:46.041
who need someone to look up to.

58:56.916 --> 58:58.375
If you wanna be a star…

59:04.458 --> 59:06.125
you're gonna have to wear a mask.

59:17.166 --> 59:18.166
Okay.

59:19.125 --> 59:19.958
Yeah.

59:22.125 --> 59:26.166
Let's answer the question
as it was prepared.

59:27.041 --> 59:28.041
Okay?

59:30.458 --> 59:31.333
Okay.

59:34.375 --> 59:37.666
I haven't found that special someone yet.

59:37.750 --> 59:38.625
Okay.

59:39.500 --> 59:41.750
But when I'm singing those love songs,

59:43.041 --> 59:46.291
I'm thinking about what <i>he</i> could be.

59:51.541 --> 59:52.500
Great.

59:53.416 --> 59:54.333
Really.

59:55.958 --> 59:58.333
Really, it was great.

59:59.833 --> 1:00:00.708
Okay?

1:00:01.208 --> 1:00:02.250
It was great.

1:00:13.125 --> 1:00:14.250
You like it?

1:00:15.916 --> 1:00:16.833
This is it.

1:00:17.458 --> 1:00:18.833
Yeah, this is the one.

1:00:31.708 --> 1:00:33.208
You look beautiful, babe.

1:00:34.208 --> 1:00:36.750
Um, please don't say that in public.

1:00:36.833 --> 1:00:40.625
Just wait for when we're
at the house, okay?

1:00:40.708 --> 1:00:44.375
This is all still
a lot for us to get used to.

1:00:47.875 --> 1:00:49.708
I don't care what you do at home.

1:00:49.791 --> 1:00:53.666
Just when we're out and about,
we have a certain image to maintain.

1:00:54.708 --> 1:00:55.708
We or me?

1:00:58.875 --> 1:01:00.791
I just want what's best for you.

1:01:02.250 --> 1:01:03.833
I know what's best for me.

1:01:09.291 --> 1:01:12.541
Why don't you try on
one of the long, black, flowing ones?

1:01:13.208 --> 1:01:15.333
Why can't I just rock my own hair?

1:01:16.083 --> 1:01:18.666
Because research says

1:01:18.750 --> 1:01:22.416
that little Black girls
like long, flowing hair.

1:01:24.458 --> 1:01:27.000
Maybe that's because people like you

1:01:27.750 --> 1:01:30.166
always tell them that's the only way
they can be beautiful.

1:01:32.166 --> 1:01:33.625
I don't make the rules.

1:01:34.291 --> 1:01:35.375
Yes, you do.

1:01:41.666 --> 1:01:43.708
You sure you don't wanna try a long one?

1:01:50.916 --> 1:01:51.833
Max.

1:02:05.625 --> 1:02:09.000
No. Actually, I like the short, curly one.

1:02:10.458 --> 1:02:12.125
Yeah, I like that one too.

1:02:14.041 --> 1:02:17.625
Max, slap that one on there,
and let's take a look at it first.

1:02:20.625 --> 1:02:23.708
Ooh, ah, ah, ah, let's go.

1:02:23.791 --> 1:02:27.125
And a…

1:02:27.208 --> 1:02:28.541
Turn around.

1:02:28.625 --> 1:02:30.000
And dip the hip. Ah!

1:02:30.083 --> 1:02:34.000
Turn and dip and move that hip. Okay!

1:02:34.083 --> 1:02:36.500
One more time. Let's go. And…

1:02:36.583 --> 1:02:38.083
All right.

1:02:39.208 --> 1:02:40.833
Turn around, and…

1:02:42.958 --> 1:02:45.041
Oh, okay. You know what?

1:02:45.125 --> 1:02:46.291
Let's take five.

1:02:46.375 --> 1:02:47.708
Good? Let's take five.

1:02:51.500 --> 1:02:54.583
I never met a Black person
who couldn't dance before.

1:02:54.666 --> 1:02:56.125
What she gotta dance for?

1:02:56.708 --> 1:02:58.708
Every pop star dances.

1:02:59.333 --> 1:03:02.208
She ain't every pop star.
Just keep the steps simple.

1:03:02.291 --> 1:03:05.875
She can join up for some of those,
and then the complicated stuff,

1:03:05.958 --> 1:03:08.333
she can be out front
doing one of her long runs.

1:03:09.208 --> 1:03:10.708
I'm down if she is.

1:03:10.791 --> 1:03:11.708
She will be.

1:03:12.333 --> 1:03:14.166
Trust me, she hates this shit.

1:03:28.458 --> 1:03:30.000
She's like a racehorse.

1:03:30.083 --> 1:03:31.458
She's not an animal.

1:03:31.958 --> 1:03:33.541
I'm sorry. It's just an expression.

1:03:33.625 --> 1:03:36.125
I don't give a fuck what it is.
Don't be calling my girl no horse.

1:03:36.208 --> 1:03:37.958
-Okay.
-I like the music here.

1:03:40.333 --> 1:03:41.458
Here.

1:03:41.541 --> 1:03:44.625
Do we have the words to give you?
Can we do that on the stand?

1:03:44.708 --> 1:03:46.541
-It's right here. I just…
-Okay.

1:03:46.625 --> 1:03:47.708
It's my brain.

1:03:47.791 --> 1:03:49.958
So you're not looking at it,
but is there a way…

1:03:57.583 --> 1:03:58.583
No, I'm good.

1:04:38.750 --> 1:04:41.208
I need some amazing vocalists behind her.

1:04:42.458 --> 1:04:44.375
-Yeah.
-Um…

1:04:44.458 --> 1:04:45.875
Who do you have in mind?

1:04:47.000 --> 1:04:48.458
-No.

1:04:48.958 --> 1:04:50.041
Y'all ready?

1:04:53.833 --> 1:04:54.708
Okay.

1:04:55.916 --> 1:04:56.750
A mirror.

1:04:57.375 --> 1:04:58.916
And I see your…

1:04:59.958 --> 1:05:01.625
I see your change.

1:05:01.708 --> 1:05:03.791
-Okay. That's not good.
-No.

1:05:13.458 --> 1:05:14.291
Okay.

1:05:16.375 --> 1:05:17.500
Wrong side.

1:05:17.583 --> 1:05:18.750
Just play the song.

1:07:01.125 --> 1:07:03.666
Hey, um,
can you turn it down, please?

1:07:04.166 --> 1:07:05.541
People trying to sleep.

1:07:06.250 --> 1:07:07.375
I'm sorry.

1:07:07.458 --> 1:07:10.916
I've been living here two whole years.
Been quiet as shit.

1:07:11.000 --> 1:07:14.000
Teenagers move in,
and I haven't had a peaceful night since.

1:07:14.083 --> 1:07:17.208
You motherfuckers always playing
music loud, giggling and shit.

1:07:18.083 --> 1:07:20.000
-I'm not a teenager.

1:07:20.083 --> 1:07:22.000
Well, you sure do look like one.

1:07:23.916 --> 1:07:26.750
That's because
you haven't seen me with my clothes off.

1:07:41.833 --> 1:07:45.083
Listen, just, uh…
just try to keep it down, okay?

1:07:46.375 --> 1:07:47.333
I'll try.

1:08:14.250 --> 1:08:15.208
Who was that?

1:08:19.208 --> 1:08:20.416
Who was at the door?

1:08:21.000 --> 1:08:22.000
Some guy.

1:08:30.458 --> 1:08:32.291
You were talking to him a long time.

1:08:32.916 --> 1:08:36.000
Relax, he just wanted me
to turn the music down.

1:08:37.833 --> 1:08:40.416
I'm surprised you didn't cuss his ass out.

1:08:40.500 --> 1:08:42.916
I wasn't in the mood to cuss his ass out.

1:08:43.875 --> 1:08:46.458
You always in the mood
to cuss somebody out.

1:08:46.541 --> 1:08:47.958
I'm trying to be nice.

1:08:50.166 --> 1:08:51.875
Nice? Since when?

1:09:45.666 --> 1:09:47.708
<i> So you ready for your big debut?</i>

1:09:49.041 --> 1:09:50.208
<i>Debut in what?</i>

1:09:51.666 --> 1:09:54.166
<i> Irv wants you</i>
<i>to come on his show and sing.</i>

1:09:55.833 --> 1:09:59.083
So you're going on his show,
and you're gonna sing.

1:09:59.166 --> 1:10:01.166
The album ain't even done yet.

1:10:01.250 --> 1:10:02.500
"Isn't done."

1:10:04.875 --> 1:10:06.583
What single should we do?

1:10:08.125 --> 1:10:10.125
Nobody wants you
to go on <i>The</i> <i>Irv Merlin Show</i>

1:10:10.208 --> 1:10:12.208
and sing a song they've never heard of.

1:10:13.333 --> 1:10:17.333
I don't wanna go on TV
singing someone else's song.

1:10:17.916 --> 1:10:19.541
I wanna sing my own music.

1:10:20.458 --> 1:10:22.833
Nobody's gonna care
what you're singing.

1:10:22.916 --> 1:10:28.250
What they care about
is that you are a young, beautiful woman

1:10:28.833 --> 1:10:30.541
with a voice of an angel.

1:10:34.791 --> 1:10:36.375
What song should I do?

1:10:38.208 --> 1:10:39.916
"Somewhere Over the Rainbow."

1:10:40.708 --> 1:10:42.166
I don't wanna sing that.

1:10:44.875 --> 1:10:45.916
Trust me.

1:10:46.625 --> 1:10:50.250
That song is wholesome,
and Irv's audience knows that.

1:10:50.833 --> 1:10:53.208
You mean white people know it.

1:10:55.708 --> 1:10:56.583
Fine.

1:11:00.291 --> 1:11:01.250
Okay.

1:11:01.833 --> 1:11:05.666
Well, why don't you take this?

1:11:05.750 --> 1:11:07.708
See if you can learn something.

1:11:07.791 --> 1:11:12.208
Take these and see
what a couple of my big stars did

1:11:12.291 --> 1:11:13.833
with their opportunity.

1:11:14.875 --> 1:11:16.833
I have a conference call in five.

1:11:26.208 --> 1:11:28.208
Kelly, get me Stevie on the phone.

1:11:55.333 --> 1:11:57.208
Are you gonna go in?

1:11:57.291 --> 1:11:58.375
Hell, no.

1:12:02.041 --> 1:12:03.833
Are you gonna come in with me?

1:12:05.500 --> 1:12:06.916
It's your brother.

1:12:11.458 --> 1:12:12.916
What you doing here?

1:12:17.083 --> 1:12:18.250
Daddy's sick.

1:12:21.833 --> 1:12:22.916
What you mean?

1:12:23.458 --> 1:12:24.791
He had a heart attack.

1:12:26.875 --> 1:12:28.750
How come Mommy didn't call me?

1:12:29.666 --> 1:12:30.708
She tried.

1:12:31.875 --> 1:12:33.083
You ain't been home.

1:12:38.333 --> 1:12:39.500
Where is he now?

1:12:41.791 --> 1:12:44.875
He's at Saint Michael's
on the fifth floor.

1:12:47.416 --> 1:12:48.958
He's been asking for you.

1:13:15.541 --> 1:13:16.458
Daddy?

1:13:25.125 --> 1:13:27.750
Hey, daughter.

1:13:30.958 --> 1:13:32.083
How you feeling?

1:13:32.666 --> 1:13:35.000
Hey, I've been better.

1:13:37.625 --> 1:13:38.500
You know,

1:13:39.875 --> 1:13:42.791
I'm sorry
I didn't come earlier to visit you. I…

1:13:44.625 --> 1:13:46.291
I didn't know you were sick.

1:13:48.750 --> 1:13:50.250
How's the album coming?

1:13:51.833 --> 1:13:52.875
Really good.

1:14:02.041 --> 1:14:04.208
They said they have to open me up,

1:14:05.291 --> 1:14:06.625
work on my heart.

1:14:08.583 --> 1:14:09.833
What's wrong with it?

1:14:10.541 --> 1:14:12.875
Not getting enough blood or something.

1:14:14.166 --> 1:14:17.166
-That's from eating all that pork.

1:14:17.250 --> 1:14:18.791
I know you ain't talking.

1:14:19.375 --> 1:14:20.833
You eat worse than me.

1:14:20.916 --> 1:14:22.916
But I'm young. I can do all that.

1:14:25.666 --> 1:14:28.791
-If I don't make it outta here--
-Don't… don't say that.

1:14:29.291 --> 1:14:31.458
Let me speak my piece, okay?

1:14:37.083 --> 1:14:39.333
I've always been an ambitious man.

1:14:40.750 --> 1:14:42.583
I got that from my father.

1:14:44.166 --> 1:14:45.750
He had a hard life.

1:14:46.750 --> 1:14:51.708
I think that's why I was so determined
to make something of myself.

1:14:54.333 --> 1:14:56.791
I wanted my life to have meaning.

1:14:59.916 --> 1:15:01.416
But after a while…

1:15:05.791 --> 1:15:09.166
…I realize I… have to settle

1:15:09.250 --> 1:15:12.916
for just being the head of my house.

1:15:14.833 --> 1:15:15.791
Shit.

1:15:17.791 --> 1:15:19.625
I wasn't even good at that.

1:15:21.750 --> 1:15:25.083
That's why it was so important

1:15:26.333 --> 1:15:29.041
to me that you make it.

1:15:32.458 --> 1:15:35.541
I thought, if you went far,

1:15:36.375 --> 1:15:37.833
I would too.

1:15:39.291 --> 1:15:40.250
I know.

1:15:41.416 --> 1:15:44.333
That's why it's hard
for me to say this…

1:15:47.250 --> 1:15:50.166
but I need you to give me my cut.

1:15:54.583 --> 1:15:55.458
Cut of what?

1:15:55.541 --> 1:15:57.583
I'm the one negotiated
that contract for you.

1:15:57.666 --> 1:15:59.208
You know what? I'm not doing this.

1:15:59.291 --> 1:16:02.291
I know you got
a new apartment downtown.

1:16:03.833 --> 1:16:06.625
I even heard
you bought your little girlfriend a car.

1:16:06.708 --> 1:16:08.333
Yeah, and where'd you hear that?

1:16:10.500 --> 1:16:12.375
You can't keep nothing from me.

1:16:17.750 --> 1:16:19.958
Is that why you wanted to see me?

1:16:20.666 --> 1:16:26.333
All I need is
for you to pay me what you owe.

1:16:32.416 --> 1:16:34.208
I don't owe you shit.

1:16:35.333 --> 1:16:39.291
You owe me your whole life.

1:16:43.000 --> 1:16:44.500
I used to think that.

1:16:45.875 --> 1:16:47.250
But I don't anymore.

1:16:49.541 --> 1:16:50.791
Look at you.

1:16:50.875 --> 1:16:52.291
Just look at ya.

1:16:52.875 --> 1:16:55.916
I didn't think
the business was gonna change you,

1:16:56.000 --> 1:17:00.083
but you up in here acting all crazy,
and you ain't even had a hit record yet.

1:17:07.250 --> 1:17:08.666
But one day, I will.

1:17:10.708 --> 1:17:12.708
I'mma have a whole bunch of 'em.

1:17:14.791 --> 1:17:18.000
And while I'm celebrating,
drinking champagne,

1:17:19.583 --> 1:17:21.291
everybody will be there…

1:17:23.458 --> 1:17:24.833
except for you.

1:17:32.500 --> 1:17:35.083
Those the last words
you wanna say to your father?

1:17:36.333 --> 1:17:39.125
Is that how you want me to remember you?

1:20:14.625 --> 1:20:16.458
<i>How would you describe</i>

1:20:16.541 --> 1:20:18.250
<i>the young lady</i>
<i>who's about to come out here?</i>

1:20:18.333 --> 1:20:20.166
<i>Well, I would say she's magical.</i>

1:20:21.416 --> 1:20:22.625
<i>I… I agree.</i>

1:20:23.208 --> 1:20:27.250
<i>Thank you.</i>
<i>And I think she's strong and confident.</i>

1:20:27.333 --> 1:20:28.791
<i>Her name is certainly fitting.</i>

1:20:28.875 --> 1:20:31.416
<i>It's true. She has a beautiful complexion.</i>

1:20:40.666 --> 1:20:41.791
You ready?

1:20:41.875 --> 1:20:42.958
Of course I am.

1:20:43.500 --> 1:20:45.291
You're confident. That's good.

1:20:51.583 --> 1:20:53.541
Your father would be so proud.

1:20:55.750 --> 1:20:56.708
I know, Ma.

1:21:00.666 --> 1:21:03.041
Jas, can you put that thing away?

1:21:03.125 --> 1:21:05.166
This is a big deal.
I wanna capture the moment.

1:21:05.250 --> 1:21:06.750
It's gonna be on TV.

1:21:07.250 --> 1:21:08.208
Not this part.

1:21:09.708 --> 1:21:12.000
What… what is that?

1:21:12.083 --> 1:21:13.208
They're practicing.

1:21:13.291 --> 1:21:15.791
Wha-- You hear how slow they playing?

1:21:15.875 --> 1:21:18.166
If they play like that,
you'll put everybody to sleep.

1:21:18.250 --> 1:21:19.958
I'mma go tell them to speed it up.

1:21:20.041 --> 1:21:23.708
Ma, they the house band.
I think they know what they doing.

1:21:23.791 --> 1:21:25.958
They're used to playing
for little white girls.

1:21:26.041 --> 1:21:27.291
You from the church.

1:21:27.375 --> 1:21:28.500
I'll be right back.

1:21:41.666 --> 1:21:43.041
Your mama still crazy.

1:21:44.458 --> 1:21:46.750
But if it wasn't for her,
I wouldn't be here.

1:21:58.041 --> 1:21:59.208
Mmm, you look good.

1:22:12.375 --> 1:22:13.375
Just a minute.

1:22:14.416 --> 1:22:16.375
Listen,
I ain't got all day now.

1:22:16.875 --> 1:22:18.666
Yo, who the fuck is that?

1:22:18.750 --> 1:22:22.750
It's the boy from the other apartment,
the one complaining about the music.

1:22:22.833 --> 1:22:24.000
Why is he here?

1:22:24.083 --> 1:22:25.291
I invited him.

1:22:29.250 --> 1:22:30.333
What's up?

1:22:31.083 --> 1:22:32.125
Come on in.

1:22:45.958 --> 1:22:46.833
For me?

1:22:47.541 --> 1:22:48.958
Well, they ain't for me.

1:22:53.916 --> 1:22:55.541
Hey, I'm Sammy.

1:22:56.833 --> 1:22:58.125
I'm Jas.

1:23:03.250 --> 1:23:04.791
So you big-time, huh?

1:23:05.291 --> 1:23:06.875
Not yet, but I will be.

1:23:08.291 --> 1:23:09.750
Yeah? What makes you so sure?

1:23:10.458 --> 1:23:11.500
I have a gift.

1:23:13.666 --> 1:23:14.666
Is that right?

1:23:16.958 --> 1:23:17.875
Jas,

1:23:19.208 --> 1:23:20.750
tell this boy

1:23:20.833 --> 1:23:23.458
that no one can sing better than me.

1:23:25.000 --> 1:23:26.708
Can't nobody sing better than her.

1:23:29.333 --> 1:23:31.958
Well, we just gonna have to see
about that, ain't we?

1:23:40.291 --> 1:23:45.333
Well, um, I just wanted to come back here,
uh, wish you good luck, give you those.

1:23:45.416 --> 1:23:46.625
See you after the show.

1:24:19.791 --> 1:24:20.833
Why is he here?

1:24:22.583 --> 1:24:25.041
-Relax.
-No. Don't tell me to relax.

1:24:27.791 --> 1:24:30.000
I just wanted him
to come and hear me sing.

1:24:31.541 --> 1:24:32.458
Why?

1:24:33.666 --> 1:24:37.375
'Cause I told him I was a good singer,
and he didn't believe me.

1:24:44.583 --> 1:24:46.625
Is that the only reason you invited him?

1:24:48.750 --> 1:24:49.666
Yes.

1:24:55.333 --> 1:24:56.750
When this is all over…

1:24:59.625 --> 1:25:02.541
the only person
I wanna hear applauding is you.

1:25:07.708 --> 1:25:10.750
I would applaud for you
even if you fall flat on your face.

1:25:11.333 --> 1:25:12.208
I know.

1:25:21.041 --> 1:25:22.000
Who is it?

1:25:23.208 --> 1:25:24.291
It's time.

1:25:59.583 --> 1:26:03.791
…and she has this aura about her
that's magnetic.

1:26:03.875 --> 1:26:08.583
<i>Yes. I was drawn to her right away</i>
<i>when I saw her perform the other night.</i>

1:26:08.666 --> 1:26:11.458
<i> Mm-hmm. I don't think</i>
<i>I've ever met someone quite like her.</i>

1:26:11.541 --> 1:26:12.541
She's

1:26:13.125 --> 1:26:16.875
<i>that kind of girl</i>
<i>that only comes along once in a lifetime.</i>

1:26:16.958 --> 1:26:19.041
<i>It's… If I can say,</i>
