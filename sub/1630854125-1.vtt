00:46.296 --> 00:52.052
* You give your love
so sweetly *

a moment's pleasure? *

02:08.670 --> 02:11.131
- No--good.
I'm--I've got something.

02:11.172 --> 02:14.009
- I wasn't talking
about the drink.

02:17.345 --> 02:19.139
- What? [laughs]
No. What?

02:19.180 --> 02:20.557
- You've been
staring at the guy

02:20.598 --> 02:22.767
like you've been waiting
to meet him your whole life.

02:22.809 --> 02:24.602
Go say hello.

02:24.644 --> 02:25.478
Buy him a drink.

02:25.520 --> 02:28.023
- No, not me, uh-uh. No.

02:28.064 --> 02:30.442
No, thank you. [laughs]

02:30.483 --> 02:32.819
Actually, okay.

02:32.861 --> 02:34.529
Okay.

02:36.740 --> 02:38.867
Thirsty?

02:38.908 --> 02:40.368
- Hmm?

02:40.410 --> 02:42.746
- Uh, for a drink.
Not--not sexually.

02:42.787 --> 02:44.497
Gross.
I didn't mean it like that.

02:44.539 --> 02:45.957
I'm gonna order
an alcoholic beverage.

02:45.999 --> 02:48.001
Would you like to have one,
too, with--with me?

02:48.043 --> 02:49.502
- Uh, sure. Why not?

02:49.544 --> 02:50.837
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

02:50.879 --> 02:53.757
- Okay, great.

[clears throat]

[clears throat] Phil.
- What can I get you?

03:00.013 --> 03:01.806
both: Old fashioned.

03:01.848 --> 03:04.893
[both laughing]
- How adorable.

03:04.934 --> 03:06.853
It's a real cute vibe
going on here.

03:06.895 --> 03:09.939
- Okay, two old fashioneds,
and you can cut that out, Phil.

03:09.981 --> 03:11.775
Hi, I'm Sheila.
- Hi.

03:11.816 --> 03:13.860
- Hi.
- I'm, uh--I'm Gary.

03:13.902 --> 03:15.320
- Oh, Gary.

03:15.362 --> 03:17.572
Wow, so we both have,
like, old-timey names.

03:17.614 --> 03:21.368
- Yeah, and I guess
very sadistic parents.

03:21.409 --> 03:22.702
- Oh, don't even
get me started.

03:22.744 --> 03:24.579
I mean,
there's no couch in here.

03:24.621 --> 03:26.456
[laughs]

03:26.498 --> 03:28.083
But yeah, Gary's--
that's a good name.

03:28.124 --> 03:29.292
That's, like, a strong name.

03:29.334 --> 03:30.669
- Yeah, I guess,
if you're, like,

03:30.710 --> 03:33.505
a used car salesman
or something.

03:33.546 --> 03:35.131
- Oh, wait, you're not a--

03:35.173 --> 03:36.883
- A--a used car salesman?

03:36.925 --> 03:38.051
- Or a mechanic?

03:38.093 --> 03:40.261
- No, no. No. Sorry.

03:40.303 --> 03:41.930
- Really needed
to get my car fixed,

03:41.971 --> 03:44.265
so I should probably go.

03:44.307 --> 03:45.684
- Oh...

03:45.725 --> 03:47.560
- I'm totally kidding.
- Okay.

03:47.602 --> 03:49.562
- [laughs]
- Okay.

03:49.604 --> 03:52.315
- Ah! Oh, yay!
- Yeah.

03:52.357 --> 03:54.025
Thanks, Phil.

03:54.067 --> 03:55.610
both: Cheers, mate!

03:57.612 --> 03:59.280
- That was kinda weird.

03:59.322 --> 04:01.658
- [chuckles] Well, not really.

04:01.700 --> 04:03.159
- I mean, what are the odds?

04:03.201 --> 04:04.285
- Odds are pretty good,
actually.

04:04.327 --> 04:06.371
Gary, I gotta come clean
with you.

04:06.413 --> 04:08.498
I'm a time traveler
from the future.

04:08.540 --> 04:10.709
So I knew everything
you were gonna say.

04:12.794 --> 04:14.671
- Right. Okay.
- [laughing]

04:14.713 --> 04:16.423
- Okay.
- Yeah.

04:16.464 --> 04:20.260
- [clears throat]
So what is the future like?

04:20.301 --> 04:21.594
- Kind of what you'd expect,
you know.

04:21.636 --> 04:23.847
Robots hunting down
inferior robots

04:23.888 --> 04:26.599
while the humans just watch
and do nothing.

04:26.641 --> 04:29.310
- So kind of like
"Blade Runner"?

04:29.352 --> 04:30.645
- No, that's a work of fiction,
Gary.

04:30.687 --> 04:32.147
This is reality
I'm talking about.

04:32.188 --> 04:33.606
- Yeah. Sorry.

04:33.648 --> 04:34.774
Yeah, you're right.
- [laughing]

04:34.816 --> 04:38.069
- Uh, well, excuse me,
but it sounds like

04:38.111 --> 04:40.739
things are pretty rough
for robots in the future.

04:40.780 --> 04:42.407
- Yes. It's a real injustice.

04:42.449 --> 04:43.867
But you know,
I wouldn't worry about it.

04:43.908 --> 04:45.702
They actually started their own
civil rights movement.

04:45.744 --> 04:47.078
- Wow.
- It's making headway.

04:47.120 --> 04:48.496
I can't talk about it.

04:48.538 --> 04:50.623
Plus, I don't wanna fuck up
your timeline.

04:50.665 --> 04:51.958
- Thank you. Thank you.
- You're welcome.

04:52.000 --> 04:53.376
- Because I like my timeline.
- Yeah.

04:53.418 --> 04:54.919
No, totally.
- You know. So, um--

04:54.961 --> 04:56.629
- Mm-hmm. [laughs]

04:56.671 --> 04:58.715
You know, all this time travel

04:58.757 --> 05:01.843
really makes a girl
super hungry.

05:01.885 --> 05:02.969
- Wow.

05:03.011 --> 05:06.598
That's--that's
super interesting.

05:06.639 --> 05:07.849
- So I'm gonna get some food.

05:07.891 --> 05:12.145
Would you like to come with me
and get food?

05:12.187 --> 05:13.438
- Food. Yeah.

05:13.480 --> 05:15.398
Let's--let's--
let's go get you some food.

05:15.440 --> 05:16.358
- Yeah?
- Yeah. Yeah.

05:16.399 --> 05:17.317
- Okay.
- All right.

05:17.359 --> 05:20.153
- Okay. Bye, Phil.

05:27.077 --> 05:28.995
I noticed you weren't really
watching the game in there.

05:29.037 --> 05:30.872
So what do you have
against televised sports?

05:30.914 --> 05:33.124
Did, like, a football kill
your grandpa or something?

05:33.166 --> 05:34.918
- Yeah, actually, it did.

05:34.959 --> 05:36.002
Love you, Grandpa.

05:36.044 --> 05:37.504
- [laughs]
- No.

05:37.545 --> 05:39.923
I didn't really grow up
in a sports-friendly household.

05:39.964 --> 05:41.716
You know,
my dad was never home.

05:41.758 --> 05:44.010
He was, like,
a traveling professor.

05:44.052 --> 05:46.680
And yeah, we never played catch
or anything like that.

05:46.721 --> 05:48.807
So I just, like, stayed inside
and watched movies.

05:48.848 --> 05:52.310
And you know,
before I knew it, he was dead.

05:52.352 --> 05:54.354
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be.

05:54.396 --> 05:56.564
What are you gonna do?
You know?

05:56.606 --> 05:58.608
- My dad's dead too.

06:00.235 --> 06:01.695
- Oh.

06:01.736 --> 06:03.988
- [laughing]
I don't know why...

06:04.030 --> 06:07.992
Uh, he was a--also a traveling
alcoholic, more so.

06:08.034 --> 06:09.703
Traveled from bar to bar,
you know?

06:09.744 --> 06:12.372
And then eventually
it just--it killed him.

06:12.414 --> 06:14.207
- I'm sorry.

06:14.249 --> 06:15.417
- That's okay.

06:16.835 --> 06:18.586
- Well, clearly, it didn't fuck
either one of us up.

06:18.628 --> 06:21.089
- No. Very normal people.
- Yeah.

06:21.131 --> 06:22.424
We're so normal.
- Mm-hmm.

06:22.465 --> 06:24.384
- Nothing wrong with us at all.
- No.

06:24.426 --> 06:25.552
I mean,
other than the fact that

06:25.593 --> 06:27.178
I'm about to ruin your life.
- Yeah?

06:27.220 --> 06:29.139
I had a feeling.

06:29.180 --> 06:31.099
- Ladies, come drink for free!

06:31.141 --> 06:34.102
[indistinct chatter]

06:34.144 --> 06:35.770
- Okay. We're here.

06:35.812 --> 06:37.981
What should we choose?

06:38.023 --> 06:40.316
- Well, it's a real
"Sophie's Choice"

06:40.358 --> 06:42.318
kind of decision now, isn't it?

06:42.360 --> 06:44.112
- I love it
when you make that joke.

06:44.154 --> 06:45.238
- What?
- What?

06:45.280 --> 06:46.656
- Best vindaloo in town!

06:46.698 --> 06:47.782
Eight stars on the Yelp.

06:47.824 --> 06:48.825
- Eight stars on Yelp!

06:48.867 --> 06:50.118
We have to go to that one.

06:51.619 --> 06:52.871
- Mr. Jeff Medolla

06:52.912 --> 06:54.330
from "The Bachelorette"
eat here.

06:54.372 --> 06:55.582
- Oh.
- Yes.

06:55.623 --> 06:57.625
- Are you playing peekaboo
or something?

06:57.667 --> 06:59.753
- No, just looking at the menu.
- Okay.

06:59.794 --> 07:01.379
Well, I would like to see
your face as soon as possible.

07:01.421 --> 07:03.048
- Really?
- If that's possible, yeah.

07:03.089 --> 07:04.007
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

07:04.049 --> 07:05.550
I wanna see your face.
- Okay.

07:05.592 --> 07:07.427
Let's just order so we can get
the business out of the way,

07:07.469 --> 07:09.929
you know, and get to pleasure,
from one OCD person to another.

07:09.971 --> 07:11.222
You understand that, right?
I'll be right back.

07:11.264 --> 07:12.307
- Yeah, for sure.
- Hold on.

07:12.349 --> 07:13.850
- Okay.
- Just looking at the menu.

07:13.892 --> 07:15.310
- Where'd Sheila go?
I can't see her.

07:15.352 --> 07:16.436
- Chicken korma.

07:16.478 --> 07:17.645
- There she is.
- Boom.

07:17.687 --> 07:18.646
What were you asking me?

07:18.688 --> 07:19.773
- The time travel thing?

07:19.814 --> 07:20.940
- Oh, yes.
- Like, yeah.

07:20.982 --> 07:22.609
Where are you--
what year are you from?

07:22.650 --> 07:23.985
- Oh, here's the thing, Gary.

07:24.027 --> 07:26.029
I have got to come clean
with you.

07:26.071 --> 07:27.947
- You're not from the future,
are you?

07:27.989 --> 07:29.616
I mean, I kinda figured, but...
- No, I am.

07:29.657 --> 07:30.784
I am, actually. Very much.

07:30.825 --> 07:32.077
I wouldn't lie about that.

07:32.118 --> 07:34.704
But I'm just not from very far
in the future.

07:34.746 --> 07:36.289
I'm from...[whispering]
24 hours in the future.

07:36.331 --> 07:37.290
- 24 hours in the future?

07:37.332 --> 07:38.500
You can do that?
- Yeah.

07:38.541 --> 07:39.626
- That's incredible.
- It's so cool.

07:39.668 --> 07:40.585
- They have the technology
to do that?

07:40.627 --> 07:41.544
- They do.
- It exists now?

07:41.586 --> 07:42.962
- Mm-hmm.
- Wow.

07:43.004 --> 07:44.714
- I know.
- Well, where is it located?

07:44.756 --> 07:45.965
- At a nail salon.
- Mm.

07:46.007 --> 07:48.259
- Excuse me,
can I get the chicken korma?

07:48.301 --> 07:50.512
- Chicken korma.
- Thank you. It's so good.

07:50.553 --> 07:52.055
And maybe two glasses
of the cab.

07:52.097 --> 07:53.264
Is that okay with you?
- Mm-hmm.

07:53.306 --> 07:54.516
- Are you gonna order?

07:54.557 --> 07:56.476
- I'll have
the chicken vin--vindaloo.

07:56.518 --> 07:57.811
- Oh, you won't regret it.

07:57.852 --> 07:59.437
Nine stars on the Yelp.
- Nine stars on Yelp.

07:59.479 --> 08:01.022
[clears throat]

08:01.064 --> 08:02.649
- Huh.
- I read a lot of reviews.

08:02.691 --> 08:04.484
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

08:04.526 --> 08:05.777
- Thanks, man.

08:05.819 --> 08:07.112
- Gary,
what do you do for work?

08:07.153 --> 08:09.781
- I'm a freelance
graphic designer

08:09.823 --> 08:11.658
for, like, nonprofits, mostly.

08:11.700 --> 08:13.868
I work from home.
- Oh.

08:13.910 --> 08:17.539
So the lonely boy
becomes the lonely man.

08:17.580 --> 08:20.667
- Well, when you say it
like that, I kinda sound sad.

08:20.709 --> 08:22.669
- No, you're not sad.

08:22.711 --> 08:25.005
You're perfect.
[stammers]

08:25.046 --> 08:26.881
Who am I to talk about
loneliness anyway?

08:26.923 --> 08:29.843
I mean, I'm an executive
producer's assistant.

08:29.884 --> 08:32.429
Don't ask me what that is
because I don't even know.

08:32.470 --> 08:35.056
I feel lonelier in an open
floor plan from 9:00 to 5:00

08:35.098 --> 08:37.600
than I would at the bottom
of a fucking well.

08:37.642 --> 08:39.019
- Huh.

08:39.060 --> 08:40.645
Bottom of the well
can be pretty fucking lonely.

08:40.687 --> 08:42.230
- Thank you.
- So about that--thank you.

08:42.272 --> 08:43.273
About that time machine...

08:43.314 --> 08:44.399
- Totally.
- From the nail salon--

08:44.441 --> 08:45.483
- Cheers.
- Yes.

08:45.525 --> 08:46.651
- Mm. You like this.

08:46.693 --> 08:49.154
- Mm-hmm. I do--what?

08:49.195 --> 08:50.822
- You will like this.

08:50.864 --> 08:52.574
So what were you asking...

08:52.615 --> 08:54.075
- I do like this.
- Me?

08:54.117 --> 08:55.660
Sorry.
- You are a time traveler.

08:55.702 --> 08:57.412
What is that like?
- Yes. Here's the thing.

08:57.454 --> 08:58.747
I don't get my nails done.

08:58.788 --> 09:00.373
I mean, it's a total
maintenance nightmare,

09:00.415 --> 09:01.416
and they chip all the time.

09:01.458 --> 09:02.459
You know what I'm saying?

09:02.500 --> 09:05.128
But I was having the best day.

09:05.170 --> 09:07.589
And I was walking down 23rd
and I saw this nail salon.

09:07.630 --> 09:09.257
It was called Nail Me Good.

09:09.299 --> 09:11.885
And I just felt
they deserved my money.

09:11.926 --> 09:13.636
I was greeted
with the international welcome

09:13.678 --> 09:15.555
of nail salons worldwide.

09:15.597 --> 09:17.474
- What color?
- Hmm.

09:17.515 --> 09:19.976
Maybe something that says
I've had a really nice day.

09:20.018 --> 09:21.561
[Louis Anton Jr.'s "Garçon"]

09:21.603 --> 09:23.813
Ooh, "Elegant Day." Perfect.

09:23.855 --> 09:25.148
So I get my nails done,

09:25.190 --> 09:26.608
and then I have to use
the bathroom.

09:26.649 --> 09:28.360
Do you have a restroom here?

09:28.401 --> 09:29.778
I just need to freshen up.

09:29.819 --> 09:31.071
[singer singing in French]

09:31.112 --> 09:32.405
And there in the back
was a large,

09:32.447 --> 09:34.074
horizontal, glowing neon bed

09:34.115 --> 09:35.492
that looked like
a tanning machine,

09:35.533 --> 09:37.619
and I was like, "Fuck it.
I'm having a great day.

09:37.660 --> 09:38.953
I should get a fucking tan."

of Orange County.

09:41.873 --> 09:43.375
So I call my girl June over.

09:43.416 --> 09:46.294
June, so how much to use
the tanning machine?

09:46.336 --> 09:47.754
- Oh, no.
It's not a tanning machine.

09:47.796 --> 09:48.755
It's a time machine.

09:48.797 --> 09:50.090
- Oh.
- Yeah.

09:50.131 --> 09:51.132
The owner bought it,
but he doesn't like it.

09:51.174 --> 09:52.717
It only goes back 24 hours.
- Hmm.

09:52.759 --> 09:53.927
Damn, false advertising.

09:53.968 --> 09:55.720
Such a problem these days,
June.

09:55.762 --> 09:57.013
- Tell me about it.
The owner went back

he bought the time machine

09:58.890 --> 10:01.267
to not buy the time machine.

10:01.309 --> 10:02.686
- So if he did that,

then why is the time machine
still here?

I didn't even think about that.

about something.

of a long relationship,

yearlong,
with a girl named Amber.

from a girl named Amber.

maybe a little fair.

Um, yeah, she was really sweet.

You know, just,
like, kinda passive.

11:41.326 --> 11:43.119
You know, she, like,
always expected me

11:43.161 --> 11:45.872
to know exactly what
was on her mind all the time.

11:45.914 --> 11:47.374

I guess you could say that.

It just--it got exhausting.

You know?

Nine stars on Yelp.

17:10.655 --> 17:12.407
[laughs]

17:12.449 --> 17:14.617
- You know, I could probably
do this forever,

17:14.659 --> 17:17.579
but it is getting
a little late.

17:17.620 --> 17:20.206
So I'd really love
to do this again sometime.

17:20.248 --> 17:21.750
- Me too.
I'll see you tomorrow.

17:21.791 --> 17:23.376
- [laughs] What?

17:23.418 --> 17:26.880
- You know, when I travel back
24 hours again.

17:26.921 --> 17:29.132
- What do you mean again?

17:29.174 --> 17:31.217
- Oh, I gotta come clean
with you, Gary.

17:31.259 --> 17:32.594
This is not our first rodeo.

17:32.635 --> 17:34.554
[laughs]
- What are you talking about?

17:34.596 --> 17:36.556
- Yeah. I've spent
the entire week with you.

17:36.598 --> 17:38.808
This night,
seven times in a row.

17:40.185 --> 17:41.936
- Okay, wait.
So you weren't kidding?

17:41.978 --> 17:43.646
- No, not kidding.

17:43.688 --> 17:45.648
Very serious.

17:45.690 --> 17:48.610
- Okay, let's just pretend
for a second

17:48.651 --> 17:50.737
that I believe your whole
future time travel bullshit--

17:50.779 --> 17:52.530
because I don't,
because it's bonkers,

17:52.572 --> 17:54.032
but let's just pretend
that I do.

17:54.074 --> 17:56.326
Why would you travel back
to the same time

17:56.368 --> 17:57.911
over and over again?

17:57.952 --> 17:59.329
Why? So you could get it right?

17:59.371 --> 18:01.581
Or to try and, like,
win me over or, like--

18:01.623 --> 18:02.582
- No.
- What are you doing?

18:02.624 --> 18:03.875
- No, that would be super weird

18:03.917 --> 18:04.876
and creepy and obsessive.

18:04.918 --> 18:05.877
No, that's the whole point.

18:05.919 --> 18:07.420
I don't have to be perfect.

18:07.462 --> 18:09.255
All this magic you're feeling,
I felt it, too,

18:09.297 --> 18:10.882
from night one
and every night after that.

18:10.924 --> 18:12.759
And no matter which way
I came at you--

18:12.801 --> 18:15.679
awkward, funny, silly, sad--
you played it all perfectly.

18:15.720 --> 18:18.098
And by the end of the night,
we were always on cloud nine.

18:18.139 --> 18:19.265
That's the thing.
I don't have to try.

18:19.307 --> 18:20.433
We just work.

18:20.475 --> 18:21.393
Have you ever had
a night like this,

18:21.434 --> 18:23.353
ever, in your entire life?

18:24.979 --> 18:26.106
You haven't. See?

18:26.147 --> 18:28.149
Because you feel the magic too.

18:28.191 --> 18:31.194
You feel it here,
and you feel it here,

18:31.236 --> 18:32.862
and you feel it here--
- Hey, all right.

18:32.904 --> 18:35.031
Yes. Yes, I feel it there.

18:35.073 --> 18:36.616
- Okay, well...[laughs]

18:36.658 --> 18:38.284
That's why I have to keep
revisiting this night.

18:38.326 --> 18:39.661
The perfect night.

18:39.703 --> 18:41.705
- But why would you
wanna revisit

18:41.746 --> 18:44.332
the same thing
over and over again?

18:44.374 --> 18:45.875
You know, wouldn't you
wanna try something new

18:45.917 --> 18:47.377
and maybe, I don't know,

18:47.419 --> 18:48.878
we go out for, like,
a second date

18:48.920 --> 18:51.798
or see if we have a future,
like, the old-fashioned way.

18:51.840 --> 18:53.633
- No, Gary,
I've already done that, okay?

18:53.675 --> 18:55.301
It just--it doesn't end well.

18:55.343 --> 18:56.886
Look, tomorrow,
Amber's gonna call you

18:56.928 --> 18:59.139
and tell you she's pregnant
or you're gonna get killed

18:59.180 --> 19:00.598
in a freaky
subway track accident.

19:00.640 --> 19:02.684
It was terrible.
Your body was, like, all--

19:02.726 --> 19:04.352
it was everywhere
and very unsettling.

19:04.394 --> 19:05.979
The entire East Coast's
gonna get nuked,

19:06.021 --> 19:07.397
you know, and we think
it's North Koreans,

19:07.439 --> 19:09.357
but we realize
it's an inside job, so...

19:09.399 --> 19:10.525
- What? What are you--

19:10.567 --> 19:11.901
- Nothing. Gary, it's okay.

19:11.943 --> 19:12.902
Listen, it doesn't matter.

19:12.944 --> 19:14.279
This is just about us.

19:14.320 --> 19:15.321
You have to trust me.

19:15.363 --> 19:18.283
This is the cleaner way.

19:19.826 --> 19:25.123
- Um--I'm, uh...

19:25.165 --> 19:26.458
I'm really tired.

19:26.499 --> 19:28.168
Uh, my head hurts.

19:28.209 --> 19:32.005
I think I should probably
get going.

19:32.047 --> 19:33.256
- I know.

19:33.298 --> 19:35.759
- It was nice to meet you,
Sheila.

19:36.885 --> 19:38.261
- Bye, Gary.

19:38.303 --> 19:40.055
I'll see you tomorrow.

19:40.096 --> 19:44.642
* *

19:44.684 --> 19:46.853
- So I've just been listening
to Sports Talk radio,

19:46.895 --> 19:49.856
'cause I don't wanna listen
to real news.

19:49.898 --> 19:52.901
[continues speaking
indistinctly]

19:52.942 --> 19:59.908
* *

20:07.916 --> 20:08.917
[brakes screeching]

20:17.342 --> 20:24.516
* *

20:25.141 --> 20:28.061
- Players surging forward
with real menace.

20:28.103 --> 20:29.646
Delivery to Vinnie Fisk!

20:29.688 --> 20:31.481
It's a perfect touch.
He's on the breakaway.

20:31.523 --> 20:33.108
Keeper comes out--

20:33.149 --> 20:36.277
[cheers and applause]

20:43.785 --> 20:44.828
- Thirsty?

20:44.869 --> 20:46.496
- Yeah. Yeah, Phil.
I wanna tap that.

20:46.538 --> 20:48.456
Happy?
- Damn.

20:48.498 --> 20:50.417
You go, girl.

20:50.458 --> 20:51.793
Why don't you go talk to him?

20:51.835 --> 20:55.171
- I am gonna go buy him
a drink.

20:55.213 --> 20:57.090
Nice evening for it, huh?

20:57.132 --> 20:59.092
- Uh, so--for--

20:59.134 --> 21:00.760
uh, for what?
- Exactly.

21:00.802 --> 21:02.262
I'm gonna order
an alcoholic beverage.

21:02.303 --> 21:04.305
Would you like one?

21:04.347 --> 21:06.266
- Uh...[clears throat]
Yeah. Sure.

21:06.307 --> 21:07.809
- Great.
- Yeah.

21:07.851 --> 21:10.270
So I had to develop these,
like, coping mechanisms.

21:10.311 --> 21:11.813
Nothing like murdering people,
but--

21:11.855 --> 21:14.399
- Oh, I had
coping mechanisms too.

21:14.441 --> 21:15.817
I mean, not the murdering part.

21:15.859 --> 21:18.653
Actually, yeah, I did.
More murdering myself.

21:18.695 --> 21:21.406
I more have, like, these
impulses that I can't control

21:21.448 --> 21:22.949
where things just...

21:22.991 --> 21:25.243
* *

21:25.285 --> 21:27.078
It's very hard
to live that way.

21:27.120 --> 21:28.830
- Yeah, I imagine that
could be quite debilitating.

21:28.872 --> 21:30.790
- Can't control it, yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

21:30.832 --> 21:32.959
- Which one do we choose?
- I don't know.

21:33.001 --> 21:35.628
It's a real "Sophie's Choice"
over here.

21:35.670 --> 21:37.797
- Best chicken korma
on the East Coast.

21:37.839 --> 21:39.632
- Let's go to this one.
- Henry P. Zagat himself raves,

21:39.674 --> 21:42.093
"It's a symphony
for the senses."

21:42.135 --> 21:46.473
Yeah, in 1995
before we moved locations.

21:46.514 --> 21:47.891
- You know in--how the--
"Titanic,"

21:47.932 --> 21:49.976
Jack teaches Rose how to spit?
- Yeah.

21:50.018 --> 21:53.980
- I kinda wanted to do that
with you, but with burping.

21:54.022 --> 21:55.106
I don't know.

21:55.148 --> 21:56.358
You know, a lot
of people actually say

21:56.399 --> 21:58.651
I remind them
of Leonardo DiCaprio,

21:58.693 --> 22:00.153
like in
"What's Eating Gilbert Grape."

22:00.195 --> 22:02.655
- [laughing]

22:02.697 --> 22:04.240
Yes.
- They say it's uncanny.

22:04.282 --> 22:06.034
- Uncanny.
- Some say.

22:07.160 --> 22:09.704
Wait, so if you're
from the future, can--

22:09.746 --> 22:11.915
you can tell...
both: What I'm gonna say?

22:11.956 --> 22:13.041
- Yeah.

22:13.083 --> 22:15.168
- [laughs]

22:15.210 --> 22:16.336
- Hey, let's order.

22:16.378 --> 22:17.796
You know, because--
- Yeah.

22:17.837 --> 22:19.172
So you can get business
out of the way

22:19.214 --> 22:21.424
so you can focus
on the pleasure.

22:21.466 --> 22:24.427
* *

22:24.469 --> 22:26.388
- Um...

22:26.429 --> 22:28.682
What--yeah.
- What can I get you?

22:28.723 --> 22:30.183
- All the things.
We want all the things.

22:30.225 --> 22:31.601
Let's get everything.

22:31.643 --> 22:33.687
Let's just, like, max out
the credit card, you know?

22:33.728 --> 22:35.855
Yeah, like curry
and chicken kebabs

22:35.897 --> 22:37.607
and saag mushroom
and butter chicken

22:37.649 --> 22:39.526
and chicken makhni tikka,
fish masala,

22:39.567 --> 22:41.361
shrimp biryani
with lamb or beef rezala,

22:41.403 --> 22:43.238
broccoli and chana,
bhindi bhaji,

22:43.279 --> 22:44.739
chicken pakora, coconut curry,

22:44.781 --> 22:48.326
and, like,
two very large wines.

22:48.368 --> 22:49.828
- Thank you, sir.

22:51.413 --> 22:52.497
- I was very hungry.

22:52.539 --> 22:56.042
- So do you know John Connor?

22:57.127 --> 22:58.211
"The Terminator."

22:58.253 --> 23:01.297
- Mm-hmm.
- He's--he's from the future.

23:01.339 --> 23:05.260
- Oh, I'm actually just
from 24 hours in the future.

23:05.301 --> 23:07.220
- Okay.
- Gary, here's the thing.

23:07.262 --> 23:09.347
Now that we've been seeing
each other for three months,

23:09.389 --> 23:12.058
I just really feel like I
can open up to you, you know?

23:12.100 --> 23:13.768
- Okay. Uh--

23:13.810 --> 23:16.062
- Normally I tell you
that I walked into a nail salon

23:16.104 --> 23:18.565
and I just stumbled upon
this time machine

23:18.606 --> 23:20.734
on a very happy,
sunshiny, perfect day.

23:20.775 --> 23:21.901
But that's just
really not the case.

23:21.943 --> 23:23.862
See, on that fateful day
three months ago

23:23.903 --> 23:25.447
when I took my first trip,

23:25.488 --> 23:27.407
I was actually
about to kill myself.

23:27.449 --> 23:30.410
[dramatic music]

23:30.452 --> 23:33.788
* *

23:33.830 --> 23:35.707
Good afternoon, everyone.

23:35.749 --> 23:37.500
I plan on killing myself,
and I'd really like

23:37.542 --> 23:39.210
to go out with some nice nails.

23:39.252 --> 23:41.963
You know, for the fans.

23:42.005 --> 23:44.382
What?

23:44.424 --> 23:45.633
- What color?

23:47.969 --> 23:50.221
- Hmm, something more
that says,

23:50.263 --> 23:52.098
"She lived a classy life."

23:52.140 --> 23:54.267
- Hmm.

23:54.309 --> 23:56.269
- "Elegant death." I like it.

23:56.311 --> 23:57.479
- It's glossy.

23:57.520 --> 23:59.064
- Great.

24:00.857 --> 24:02.275
- Do you have a bathroom here?

24:02.317 --> 24:04.235
I'd really like to die
on an empty bladder.

24:04.277 --> 24:06.154
- Yeah.

24:06.196 --> 24:07.364
I have a bathroom.

24:07.405 --> 24:09.908
Maybe before you straight up
murder yourself,

24:09.949 --> 24:11.576
go in there.

24:12.619 --> 24:13.578
- What?

24:13.620 --> 24:14.788
Time travel?

24:14.829 --> 24:16.539
Why? Why would I do that?

24:16.581 --> 24:18.583
Why would I wanna go back
to yesterday?

24:18.625 --> 24:20.126
Yesterday was shit too.

24:20.168 --> 24:21.670
Let me tell you, okay?

24:21.711 --> 24:23.755
I do not wanna fucking do that.

24:23.797 --> 24:25.382
I do not wanna go back there.

24:25.423 --> 24:28.301
That would be a really, really,
really big mistake, you know?

24:28.343 --> 24:30.637
I'm just such a fucking loser.

24:30.679 --> 24:32.263
I'm such a fucking sad sack.

24:32.305 --> 24:33.598
Why are you so nice to me?

24:33.640 --> 24:36.184
Why are you so nice to me?

24:36.226 --> 24:37.519
- You tip decent.

24:37.560 --> 24:39.270
- I do tip well.

24:39.312 --> 24:41.523
[crying] Just gonna...

24:41.564 --> 24:44.818
I don't wanna ruin my nails.

24:44.859 --> 24:46.861
- Okay.
- Just get it, right?

24:46.903 --> 24:50.532
- Okay. Okay. Look up.

24:52.242 --> 24:53.535
- Time travel.

24:53.576 --> 24:54.744
Tomorrow, yesterday,
it doesn't matter.

24:54.786 --> 24:56.746
That's the problem.
That is the problem.

24:56.788 --> 25:00.000
No matter what,
my life is shit, okay?

25:00.041 --> 25:04.337
- This is a second chance,
and those are rare.

25:04.379 --> 25:06.339
So maybe you should take it.

25:06.381 --> 25:09.092
You might see things
differently on the other side.

25:09.134 --> 25:10.802
And if you don't,

25:10.844 --> 25:13.638
you can always
kill yourself later.

25:13.680 --> 25:15.306
- Yeah, I'll do it. Fuck it.

25:15.348 --> 25:18.184
Maybe I'll get shit out on
the other side of the rainbow.

25:18.226 --> 25:20.520
- That's the spirit.

25:20.562 --> 25:22.272
[whirring]

25:24.232 --> 25:25.525
- And here I am.

25:25.567 --> 25:27.235
24 hours in the past.

25:29.946 --> 25:32.365
- Well, how do you feel now?

25:32.407 --> 25:34.409
- Much better.

25:34.451 --> 25:37.412
- You just kind of got shit out
the other side of the rainbow?

25:37.454 --> 25:40.498
- Mm-hmm. Yeah.

25:41.458 --> 25:43.793
- I've been shit out
the other side a couple times.

25:43.835 --> 25:45.628
- [laughs]
- It's okay.

25:45.670 --> 25:47.088
Nothing to be ashamed of.

25:47.130 --> 25:48.840
- Hmm.

25:48.882 --> 25:52.469
In fact, this is the first time
I've been this happy

25:52.510 --> 25:56.014
in a very, very,
very long time.

25:56.056 --> 26:00.602
- Well, it makes me
really happy.

26:00.643 --> 26:03.897
I'm very, very glad
to hear that.

26:05.565 --> 26:07.776
- I'll be right back.
- Okay.

26:08.860 --> 26:11.780
[pensive music]

26:11.821 --> 26:15.158
* *

26:15.200 --> 26:17.118
- Good night, Amit.

26:17.160 --> 26:24.084
* *

26:30.131 --> 26:32.550
Do you think I'm a passenger
on the crazy train?

26:32.592 --> 26:33.968
- No. No, I don't.

26:34.010 --> 26:36.179
- You think I'm the conductor
of the crazy train?

26:36.221 --> 26:37.430
I should not have said
any of that.

26:37.472 --> 26:38.598
That was TMI.

26:38.640 --> 26:39.683
I don't know
what I was thinking.

26:39.724 --> 26:40.600
I shouldn't have said that
to you.

26:40.642 --> 26:42.519
- Hey. Hey. Hey, relax.

26:42.560 --> 26:43.645
I don't think that.

26:43.687 --> 26:45.772
I really don't, at all.

26:45.814 --> 26:48.274
And even if I do, who cares?

26:48.316 --> 26:49.609
My life's been so boring.

26:49.651 --> 26:52.153
I can get on this ride.

26:52.195 --> 26:53.363
- Hmm.

26:53.405 --> 26:55.490
Well, then, all aboard, baby.
- All right.

26:55.532 --> 26:57.450
Well, just don't drive us
off a cliff, all right?

26:57.492 --> 26:58.660
- Oh, I would never.

27:03.331 --> 27:04.791
[gasps] Let's shop.

27:04.833 --> 27:06.376
- For dirty clothes?

27:06.418 --> 27:09.462
- [laughs] They're not dirty.

27:09.504 --> 27:11.840
Look how cute.

27:11.881 --> 27:13.717
- This one has gum on it.
- Oh, my God.

27:13.758 --> 27:16.219
[laughs] Gary.
- What?

27:16.261 --> 27:18.555
- An old-timey shirt
with your old-timey name.

27:18.596 --> 27:19.931
You have to get this.
- No.

27:19.973 --> 27:20.974
- Yes.
I'm getting it for you.

27:21.016 --> 27:22.100
- Absolutely not.
- You have to.

27:22.142 --> 27:23.268
- No.
- You have to.

27:23.309 --> 27:26.604
- Fine, but only
if I can get you this.

27:26.646 --> 27:28.231
- Okay. I'll get that.

27:28.273 --> 27:29.482
- Okay.

27:29.524 --> 27:30.817
- Thank you.

27:30.859 --> 27:32.152
It'll look very cute on you.

27:32.193 --> 27:33.361
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

27:33.403 --> 27:35.697
- Can't wait to wear
some random guy's shirt.

27:35.739 --> 27:37.115
- [laughs]

27:40.785 --> 27:42.287
Isn't it pretty tonight?
- Yes.

27:42.328 --> 27:43.621
- You look very good
in your new shirt, by the way.

27:43.663 --> 27:45.331
- Oh, thank you. Mm.

27:45.373 --> 27:48.835
- [laughing]

27:48.877 --> 27:51.171
Oh, by the way,
right there is exactly--

27:51.212 --> 27:53.965
- Is that where you grew up
or something?

27:54.007 --> 27:56.343
- What?
- Oh, I'm sorry.

27:56.384 --> 27:58.678
I thought, uh--for some reason
I thought maybe

27:58.720 --> 27:59.888
you might have mentioned...

27:59.929 --> 28:02.682
- Yeah, no. Yes. Um.

28:02.724 --> 28:06.394
[laughs] 600, Apartment 1K.

28:06.436 --> 28:08.021
- Okay.

28:08.063 --> 28:09.689
- My entire childhood.

28:09.731 --> 28:10.690
Yeah.
- That's crazy.

28:10.732 --> 28:12.025
What was that like?

28:12.067 --> 28:14.361
- Uh, you know, the city
was very different then,

28:14.402 --> 28:16.154
but it was kinda lonely.

28:16.196 --> 28:18.907
My mom kinda gave up
pretty early.

28:22.744 --> 28:24.329
[chuckles]
- What?

28:24.371 --> 28:27.207
- Um, there was
this, like, cable guy

28:27.248 --> 28:29.626
who stopped by one afternoon.

28:29.668 --> 28:31.711
I was really little,
so I don't really remember,

28:31.753 --> 28:34.923
but he was very nice to me.

28:34.964 --> 28:37.759
I don't know why
I just told you that.

28:37.801 --> 28:39.010
It's weird.
- It is a little weird.

28:39.052 --> 28:39.969
- Yeah.
- It's okay.

28:40.011 --> 28:40.970
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

28:41.012 --> 28:42.722
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah.

28:42.764 --> 28:44.391
- Come here.
Wanna take a picture?

28:44.432 --> 28:45.850
- Obviously.
- Let's take a selfie.

28:45.892 --> 28:47.560
- Yeah. Let me take it.
I have really long arms.

28:47.602 --> 28:48.645
- No, no, no, no.

28:48.687 --> 28:50.021
Oh. Oops.
- Oh, fuck! Fuck.

28:50.063 --> 28:51.773
- No, it's fine.
- Oh, no.

28:51.815 --> 28:53.108
I'm sorry.
- It's not a big deal.

28:53.149 --> 28:54.943
- No. I'm sorry. I think--
- It's just my phone.

28:54.984 --> 28:56.319
- I think I can fix it.
- Gary.

28:56.361 --> 28:57.821
- I fucked up. I'm sorry.
- Gary!

28:57.862 --> 28:58.988
- I'm sorry--yeah--
- Gary!

29:03.118 --> 29:05.578
It's okay for things
to be messy sometimes.

29:05.620 --> 29:08.581
[soft music]

29:08.623 --> 29:15.797
* *

29:20.468 --> 29:22.387
Oh, what a night.

29:22.429 --> 29:23.930
- Yeah, it was worth
all the time travel?

29:23.972 --> 29:25.390
- Oh, yeah.

29:25.432 --> 29:28.101
Henry Zagat says it's
a symphony for all the senses.

29:28.143 --> 29:29.936
- Zagat?
- Yeah.

29:29.978 --> 29:30.937
- "Zuh-gat"?
- I think so.

29:30.979 --> 29:32.230
- I thought it was "za-get."

29:32.272 --> 29:34.774
I've been saying "za-get."
- [laughs]

29:34.816 --> 29:36.526
I don't think so.

29:36.568 --> 29:38.028
Maybe I'm wrong.

29:42.490 --> 29:45.118
[siren wailing]

29:46.661 --> 29:48.955
So actually, this was the spot
I was gonna kill myself.

29:48.997 --> 29:50.290
Can you believe it?

29:52.375 --> 29:53.793
- Wait. Really?

29:53.835 --> 29:54.961
- I know.

29:55.003 --> 29:55.962
Think about it.

29:56.004 --> 29:57.630
The drop, the dive,

29:57.672 --> 29:58.882
the chill of the water.

29:58.923 --> 30:01.468
I mean, it's a pretty good way
to go.

30:01.509 --> 30:03.970
Plus, no blood,
and no, like, weird forensics.

30:04.012 --> 30:04.971
Like, what happened to her?

30:05.013 --> 30:06.598
It'd be very obvious.

30:06.639 --> 30:08.892
Pretty selfless way to kill
yourself, don't you think?

30:08.933 --> 30:10.060
I feel like people
would call me

30:10.101 --> 30:12.312
the Mother Teresa of suicides.

30:12.354 --> 30:14.606
Maybe not,
but I don't mind if they do.

30:18.193 --> 30:21.946
- I mean,
at the end of the day, it's--

30:21.988 --> 30:23.823
deep down, it's...

30:23.865 --> 30:25.992
it's all jokes, right?

30:26.034 --> 30:28.703
- Uh, no. Not all of them.

30:28.745 --> 30:30.288
But I'm okay now.

30:30.330 --> 30:32.207
- I'm sorry. I wish I could--

30:32.248 --> 30:34.668
- I've been waiting for you
my whole life, Gary.

30:34.709 --> 30:37.671
- Oh. Um--all right.

30:37.712 --> 30:40.173
Well, don't you think
it's a little early for that?

30:40.215 --> 30:43.134
- It's been five months, Gary.

30:43.176 --> 30:45.512
- Oh--we met today.

30:45.553 --> 30:47.597
We met literally today.

30:47.639 --> 30:50.433
- You're the first person
to make me truly happy ever.

30:50.475 --> 30:51.434
You're the man I've been

30:51.476 --> 30:52.769
looking over
men's shoulders for.

30:52.811 --> 30:54.020
It's you this whole time.

30:54.062 --> 30:55.939
I've been waiting
my whole life for you.

30:55.980 --> 30:57.899
You're finally here.

31:00.360 --> 31:02.028
- Uh...

31:02.070 --> 31:05.615
I think we should take
a breath.

31:05.657 --> 31:08.535
And I'm gonna go.

31:08.576 --> 31:10.578
Is that okay?
Is it okay if I go?

31:10.620 --> 31:12.163
- Yeah, I'll be fine.

31:12.205 --> 31:13.581
- You're not gonna do
anything dumb, right?

31:13.623 --> 31:14.791
- Mm-mm.

31:14.833 --> 31:15.917
- You're sure you're okay?

31:15.959 --> 31:18.378
- Mm-hmm.

31:24.175 --> 31:25.885
I'll see you tomorrow, Gary.

31:25.927 --> 31:28.138
[soft music]

31:28.179 --> 31:29.431
[whirring]

31:29.472 --> 31:31.391
Oh, what a night.

31:31.433 --> 31:34.060
This was the spot
I was gonna kill myself.

31:34.102 --> 31:35.645
Can you believe it?

31:35.687 --> 31:39.441
* *

31:39.482 --> 31:40.734
- I'm sorry. I--

31:40.775 --> 31:42.235
- Gary, I've been waiting
for you my whole life.

31:42.277 --> 31:43.903
- Oh.
- Hmm.

31:43.945 --> 31:47.574
- Well, um, I'm gonna go.

31:47.615 --> 31:48.992
- Bye, Gary.

31:49.034 --> 31:50.410
I'll see you tomorrow.

31:50.452 --> 31:51.745
* *

31:51.786 --> 31:52.787
[whirring]

31:52.829 --> 31:53.913
You're the person I've been

31:53.955 --> 31:55.415
looking over
men's shoulders for.

31:55.457 --> 31:56.583
You're the one
I've been waiting for,

31:56.624 --> 31:58.251
and you're finally here.

31:58.293 --> 31:59.586
Think about it:
the fall, the plunge,

31:59.627 --> 32:02.380
the dive and the chill,
the water.

32:02.422 --> 32:04.090
Very good spot for it.
And no blood.

32:04.132 --> 32:05.925
You are the person
that I have been waiting for

32:05.967 --> 32:07.886
my entire life.

32:07.927 --> 32:11.431
- Is it okay if I go?

32:11.473 --> 32:13.516
Maybe talk about this
some other time.

32:13.558 --> 32:15.643
Don't you think it's a little
too soon to talk like that?

32:15.685 --> 32:17.145
- You're not even gonna
remember this

32:17.187 --> 32:19.939
and it just makes me
so, so sad, Gary, you know?

32:19.981 --> 32:21.191
- Tomorrow can't be that bad.

32:21.232 --> 32:22.400
- Of course it can.

32:22.442 --> 32:24.110
I have to keep revisiting it.

32:24.152 --> 32:25.487
The perfect night.

32:25.528 --> 32:27.155
You do it every time.
Just fucking walk away.

32:27.197 --> 32:28.114
It's fine.
- How is that po--we ju--

32:28.156 --> 32:29.324
- Every time.

32:29.366 --> 32:30.450
- I don't know
what you're talking about

32:30.492 --> 32:32.452
'cause we just met, but okay.

32:32.494 --> 32:36.206
* *

32:36.247 --> 32:37.791
[door opens]

32:37.832 --> 32:39.459
[bell jingles]

32:39.501 --> 32:44.506
* *

32:44.547 --> 32:45.715
[whirring]

32:46.341 --> 32:48.343
- Surging forward
with real menace.

32:48.385 --> 32:50.220
Delivery to Vinnie Fisk!

32:50.261 --> 32:52.138
It's a perfect touch.
He's on the breakaway.

32:52.180 --> 32:53.348
Keeper comes out--

32:53.390 --> 32:56.518
[cheers and applause]

33:03.733 --> 33:06.111
- Hey, I'm Sheila.
Do you want a drink?

33:06.152 --> 33:07.278
- Me?
- Mm-hmm.

33:07.320 --> 33:09.989
- Hi. Uh, sure.

33:10.031 --> 33:12.659
Yeah. Okay. I'm Gary.

33:12.701 --> 33:14.911
- Hi, Gary.
- Hello.

33:14.953 --> 33:16.913
- Phil.

33:16.955 --> 33:17.997
- What can I get you?

33:18.039 --> 33:18.998
- He'll have an old fashioned.

33:19.040 --> 33:19.958
I will have a whiskey neat.

33:20.000 --> 33:21.292
Thank you.

33:21.334 --> 33:25.171
- [clears throat]
I--I really like your dress.

33:25.213 --> 33:28.049
It reminds me of, like,
a picnic.

33:29.134 --> 33:32.095
[soft music]

33:32.137 --> 33:33.847
* *

33:33.888 --> 33:36.057
Guilty--I am not a sports fan.

33:36.099 --> 33:37.225
- Yeah, no, I figured.

33:37.267 --> 33:38.852
We don't have to talk
about that again.

33:38.893 --> 33:40.103
- Hmm? Again?

33:40.145 --> 33:41.813
- Oh, no, I didn't--

33:41.855 --> 33:43.314
what were you saying?

33:43.356 --> 33:45.692
- Oh, um,
I grew up pretty neurotic.

33:45.734 --> 33:47.027
- Mm-hmm.

33:47.068 --> 33:49.446
- And not really
in a warm environment.

33:49.487 --> 33:50.655
My dad was never home.
- Oh, yeah.

33:50.697 --> 33:52.073
Why are we talking
about our dead dads?

33:52.115 --> 33:53.241
Why do we always do this?

33:53.283 --> 33:54.325
We don't have to do this,
you know.

33:54.367 --> 33:55.660
We can, like, make new choices.

33:55.702 --> 33:57.787
- Wow, it's a real
"Sophie's Choice" out here.

33:57.829 --> 34:00.373
* *

34:00.415 --> 34:02.500
- Best chicken korma
on the East Coast.

34:02.542 --> 34:05.712
Henry P. Zagat himself raves,
"It's a symphony for--"

34:08.673 --> 34:09.883
- Oh.

34:09.924 --> 34:12.635
Do you know, um, John Connor?

34:16.097 --> 34:19.434
'Cause he's from the future.

34:19.476 --> 34:20.894
"Give me your clothes,
your boots,

34:20.935 --> 34:22.520
and your motorcycle."

34:23.938 --> 34:25.732
"I'm the governor."
- Hmm.

34:25.774 --> 34:27.567
- Well, that's actually not
from the movie.

34:27.609 --> 34:30.320
He just later became
the governor, which was crazy.

34:30.362 --> 34:33.573
Did you know that "Predator"
has two governors in it?

34:33.615 --> 34:36.242
Jesse Ventura
and Arnold Schwarzenegger.

34:36.284 --> 34:37.410
I mean, that has to be, like,

34:37.452 --> 34:39.287
a Snapple Fact or something,
at least.

34:39.329 --> 34:41.456
- Gary, I gotta come clean
with you.

34:41.498 --> 34:44.834
We have been doing this
for almost a year now,

34:44.876 --> 34:47.587
and things are starting to feel
a little one-sided.

34:47.629 --> 34:50.256
You know what I mean?
- Um, a year?

34:50.298 --> 34:51.549
We've, uh--
- I get it.

34:51.591 --> 34:53.176
This night,
this is just one night to you.

34:53.218 --> 34:55.136
But for me, my entire life
revolves around

34:55.178 --> 34:56.429
this night only, nothing else.

34:56.471 --> 34:57.472
And is it a great night?

34:57.514 --> 34:59.099
Yeah. Is it my fault?

34:59.140 --> 35:00.433
Yes. My choice?

35:00.475 --> 35:02.769
Have I created this? Yes.

35:02.811 --> 35:05.230
But God damn it, Gary,
even a perfectly cooked steak

35:05.271 --> 35:07.107
starts to tastes like shit
when you eat it

35:07.148 --> 35:10.610
all day, every day, you know?

35:12.737 --> 35:13.988
- Okay. I'm sorry.

35:14.030 --> 35:15.323
I'm a little confused.

35:15.365 --> 35:16.783
- I just--I really thought
we were just

35:16.825 --> 35:20.120
so perfect for each other,
but no.

35:20.161 --> 35:21.996
I just don't know.
I don't know.

35:22.038 --> 35:23.707
I'm starting to feel stunted.

35:23.748 --> 35:25.000
Yeah. You know?

35:25.041 --> 35:27.127
And it's kind of my fault
because I have kept us

35:27.168 --> 35:29.504
in this whirlwind of hell
over and over

35:29.546 --> 35:31.339
and over and over
of this crazy loop.

35:31.381 --> 35:32.549
But you know, I gotta
be honest with you,

35:32.590 --> 35:33.800
it's kinda your fault too.

35:33.842 --> 35:34.968
Yeah, a little bit.

35:35.010 --> 35:37.053
You are so passive.

35:37.095 --> 35:39.014
Everything has to be perfect.

35:39.055 --> 35:40.181
You don't wanna make a mess.

35:40.223 --> 35:41.307
You don't wanna
ruffle any feathers.

35:41.349 --> 35:42.809
It's just like, ugh!

35:42.851 --> 35:46.146
You know, there is
nowhere but down with you.

35:46.187 --> 35:47.147
- I think I'm gonna go.

35:47.188 --> 35:49.149
- Oh, shocker.
- Yeah.

35:49.190 --> 35:51.317
- Okay. Bye, Gary.

35:51.359 --> 35:54.571
- Yeah.
Thank you for this.

35:54.612 --> 35:57.032
And please don't take
this the wrong way,

35:57.073 --> 35:58.366
but I think you need some help.

35:58.408 --> 36:00.035
- Oh, no.
Actually, you know what, Gary?

36:00.076 --> 36:01.453
We need help.
- No.

36:01.494 --> 36:02.620
You need help.
- We.

36:02.662 --> 36:03.872
- There's no we
in this situation.

36:03.913 --> 36:05.290
- We. We need help.
- No, it's you. It's you.

36:08.376 --> 36:10.003

- Here you go.

but you're gonna

36:14.924 --> 36:16.217
stop to pay like a good guy?

36:16.259 --> 36:17.594
- Yeah, I'm gonna stop to pay.
- You are so lame.

36:17.635 --> 36:19.262
- I'm sorry, I don't wanna
get arrested on a date.

36:19.304 --> 36:20.680
- Oh, my. Arrested?

36:20.722 --> 36:22.349
- Can you hurry up?
- Oh, my God. You are so dumb.

36:22.390 --> 36:23.725
- Make sure you have 25%.
- Bye, Gary.

36:23.767 --> 36:25.435
- Bye.
- Please tell your friends.

36:25.477 --> 36:27.937
- Bye!
- Bye! Ugh.

36:38.239 --> 36:41.368
- Rough night, Amit.

36:41.409 --> 36:42.911
Can I bum a cigarette?

36:46.998 --> 36:49.167
Oh, that beautiful case.

36:49.209 --> 36:51.294

Am I right?

- I'm happily married.
- Oh, good for you.

37:19.155 --> 37:20.990
Your life is perfect.

37:22.742 --> 37:24.911
- Maybe luck will change
for you too one day.

37:24.953 --> 37:26.329
- Ha. No.

37:26.371 --> 37:27.831
See, no.

37:27.872 --> 37:29.958
For me, nothing changes.
Like, ever.

37:30.000 --> 37:33.086
My life is just consistent,
consistent shit.

37:33.128 --> 37:35.338
Nothing ever fucking changes.

37:39.718 --> 37:41.928

beautiful, married man.

37:48.977 --> 37:50.437
Oh, my God, change.

37:50.478 --> 37:52.647
I can fix him.
I can change him.

37:52.689 --> 37:54.441
This is something
I can actually do.

37:54.482 --> 37:55.442
- Oh, no. Well, no.

37:55.483 --> 37:56.609
- Yeah.
- No.

37:56.651 --> 37:57.652
- Yeah.
- You can't.

37:57.694 --> 37:58.778
People don't really change,

37:58.820 --> 38:00.613
and you certainly
can't change people.

38:00.655 --> 38:02.699
In my culture,
we have a saying,

38:02.741 --> 38:05.410
"You can't fit a square peg
into a round hole."

38:05.452 --> 38:07.287
- I don't think that's
in your culture.

38:07.328 --> 38:08.496
It's a universal saying.

38:08.538 --> 38:09.706
- You can't change people.

38:09.748 --> 38:11.332
The world doesn't
work that way.

38:12.917 --> 38:14.919
- But what is that,
though, really?

38:14.961 --> 38:18.089
I mean, those are
just words, Amit.

38:18.131 --> 38:19.632
And what are words?

38:19.674 --> 38:22.260
Words are just, you know,
thoughts

38:22.302 --> 38:24.804
that we have
that exit our mouth.

38:24.846 --> 38:28.183
We talk too much, as a
civilization, not me and you,

38:28.224 --> 38:32.520
which I regret that
we don't do this more often.

38:32.562 --> 38:34.147
You're a really good man.

anything like

It's a second chance.

43:48.211 --> 43:49.963
You can always
kill yourself later.

43:50.005 --> 43:51.756
- Okay. Let's do it.

43:51.798 --> 43:53.550
Let's fuck up
some history, huh?

43:53.591 --> 43:55.218
- That's the spirit.
- Hmm.

43:55.260 --> 43:56.720
[whirring]

43:56.761 --> 43:57.971
And here I am.

43:58.013 --> 44:00.223
24 hours in the past.

44:00.265 --> 44:02.350
- Wow.

44:02.392 --> 44:04.686
Wow.
- Mm-hmm.

44:04.728 --> 44:06.980
- You can go back
to any point in the past,

44:07.022 --> 44:09.149
and you chose yesterday?
- Mm-hmm.

44:09.190 --> 44:11.234
- You didn't wanna go somewhere
more meaningful, like,

44:11.276 --> 44:12.819
I don't know, like,
to kill Hitler?

44:12.861 --> 44:15.655
- Well, I did
take out Smithson.

44:15.697 --> 44:17.365
- Who?
- Exactly.

44:17.407 --> 44:18.867
And Gary, I mean--
and why yesterday?

44:18.908 --> 44:20.452
I don't know; I mean,
technically speaking,

44:20.493 --> 44:22.203
it was actually June's fault.
She chose it.

44:22.245 --> 44:24.039
And let me tell you, when I
ended up 24 hours in the past,

44:24.080 --> 44:24.998
I was like,
"What the fuck, June?"

44:25.040 --> 44:26.458
I mean, life is already shit.

44:26.499 --> 44:28.335
I don't need a reminder
of yesterday's shit, right?

44:28.376 --> 44:30.462
I kind of preferred, like,
nostalgic childhood shit,

44:30.503 --> 44:32.464
that I could really like.
But what are you gonna do?

44:32.505 --> 44:34.883
So then I thought alcohol,
and I stumbled into that bar,

44:34.924 --> 44:36.551
and then I met you.

44:36.593 --> 44:39.637
And everything changed.

44:39.679 --> 44:42.015
- Right.
And that was a year ago?

44:42.057 --> 44:43.516
- Technically yesterday, but
yes,

44:43.558 --> 44:45.977
we've been doing this
for an entire year--

44:46.019 --> 44:48.355
365 days to be exact.

44:48.396 --> 44:51.858
In fact, it's, um--

44:51.900 --> 44:53.902
it's our anniversary, Gary.

44:55.737 --> 44:56.863
- Hey.

44:56.905 --> 44:58.406
Could I have the check, please?

44:58.448 --> 45:00.867
- Happy anniversary.

45:00.909 --> 45:02.535
Gary, thank you
so much for dinner.

45:02.577 --> 45:03.870
It was delicious.

45:03.912 --> 45:05.497
So should we head out
and find some dessert?

45:05.538 --> 45:07.665
- Mm, I don't think so.

45:07.707 --> 45:09.542
Are you for Gary?

45:09.584 --> 45:11.086
- Uh, yeah.
- Yeah.

45:11.127 --> 45:12.879
Look, I actually have
to be up kinda early,

45:12.921 --> 45:14.964
and I need my rest.

45:15.006 --> 45:17.050
But this was great.

45:17.092 --> 45:19.177
- This never happened
with old Gary.

45:19.219 --> 45:20.970
I must have really
done a number on you.

45:21.012 --> 45:23.223
Wow. Changes I have made.

45:23.264 --> 45:26.226
- Mm-hmm. Yeah.
Is that so? Hey. Hey.

45:26.267 --> 45:27.811
- Oh, I thought you were--
- No, listen.

45:27.852 --> 45:30.980
Look, not that I'm buying any
of your bullshit, future girl,

45:31.022 --> 45:33.149
but just out of curiosity,
just 'cause I wanna know,

45:33.191 --> 45:35.068
what exactly did
you change about me

45:35.110 --> 45:36.986
that was so fucking awful?
- Oh, okay.

45:37.028 --> 45:38.446
So we've spent
a lot of time together,

45:38.488 --> 45:40.407
and you've shared
a lot with me, okay?

45:40.448 --> 45:42.409
Like, I know all
about your childhood,

45:42.450 --> 45:44.953
your disappointments, the ups
and downs, all the traumas.

45:44.994 --> 45:46.413
And I've kind of, like,
narrowed them down

45:46.454 --> 45:48.540
to the moments that aided
in your mental decline.

45:48.581 --> 45:51.251
I call them the, "where things
went wrong for Gary" moments.

45:51.292 --> 45:52.794
- Oh, is that what
you call them?

45:52.836 --> 45:54.504
- Hey, dial down the sarcasm.

45:54.546 --> 45:56.006
It's our fucking anniversary.

45:56.047 --> 45:57.882
So anyway, I traveled back
there and I fixed them.

45:57.924 --> 45:59.092
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

45:59.134 --> 46:00.593
- Give me an example of one.
- Fine.

46:00.635 --> 46:01.886
[whirring]

46:01.928 --> 46:03.722
[inquisitive music]

46:03.763 --> 46:06.224
- Yes?
- You're Gary, right?

46:06.266 --> 46:07.726
- Mom!
- [clears throat]

46:07.767 --> 46:10.270
My name's Charlie and I just
moved in across the street.

46:10.311 --> 46:11.604
- Okay.

46:11.646 --> 46:15.358
- May I interest you
in a friendly game of catch?

46:15.400 --> 46:17.027
- I'm not supposed
to talk to strangers.

46:17.068 --> 46:18.903
- Can I tell you
a little secret?

46:18.945 --> 46:21.197
I lost my son many years ago,

46:21.239 --> 46:22.907
in a boating accident,
actually,

46:22.949 --> 46:24.784
and it makes me
very, very, very sad

46:24.826 --> 46:26.244
and I miss him so much.

46:26.286 --> 46:27.746
It would truly mean
the world to me

46:27.787 --> 46:30.165
if you would humor an old man
and play a friendly game

46:30.206 --> 46:32.167
of catch out in the yard.

46:32.208 --> 46:35.211
What do you say, sport?

46:35.253 --> 46:36.254
- Okay.

46:38.089 --> 46:39.007
- You should watch
more wrestling.

46:39.049 --> 46:41.051
The fake kind.

46:41.092 --> 46:43.136
- It's not fake.
- It's pretty fake, kid.

46:43.178 --> 46:45.889
A lot of people are gonna
say you're wrong, Gary.

46:45.930 --> 46:47.349
Fuck them.

46:47.390 --> 46:49.893
- Okay.

46:49.934 --> 46:52.645
- Oh, God. Gary, no.

46:52.687 --> 46:54.522
- My miming's good, right?

46:54.564 --> 46:56.441
- Gary, no. Don't do that.

46:56.483 --> 46:58.109
People don't like mimes.

46:58.151 --> 46:59.611
Please don't do that again.

46:59.652 --> 47:00.779
- Hey, wait.

47:00.820 --> 47:02.155
Just wait a second.
- What?

47:02.197 --> 47:04.240
- You were Uncle Charlie?
- It was I.

47:04.282 --> 47:07.243
- You're so fucking crazy.
That's fucking crazy.

47:07.285 --> 47:08.370
- Why?

47:08.411 --> 47:09.537
We just played
a little catch, big deal.

47:09.579 --> 47:11.122
- Sheila, I played catch
with Uncle Charlie

47:11.164 --> 47:13.166
every Sunday afternoon
for, like, three years.

47:13.208 --> 47:14.584
- I know.
Gary, what can I say?

47:14.626 --> 47:16.044
I'm very methodical.

47:16.086 --> 47:17.379
I went back a bunch to make
a difference in your life.

47:17.420 --> 47:18.588
You're welcome.

47:18.630 --> 47:20.048
- How do you not see
how fucked up this is?

47:20.090 --> 47:22.592
- What?
- What? I loved that guy.

47:22.634 --> 47:25.470
I fucking loved Uncle Charlie.

47:25.512 --> 47:27.263
He was like my dad.

47:27.305 --> 47:29.182
- I know.
That is the whole point.

47:29.224 --> 47:30.767
- No, it's not the point.

47:30.809 --> 47:32.227
You can't just
choose for people.

47:32.268 --> 47:33.478
You can't just do that.

47:33.520 --> 47:34.854
You can't just put
a positive influence

47:34.896 --> 47:36.648
and pawn 'em on someone
and hope it all works out.

47:36.690 --> 47:39.693
You can't fucking do that.
That's not how life works.

47:39.734 --> 47:40.944
What else did you change?

47:40.985 --> 47:42.320
- [stammers]
Well, just a couple things.

47:42.362 --> 47:43.697
I just deleted a few people.

47:43.738 --> 47:46.408
You know, like your
middle school bully, Patrick,

47:46.449 --> 47:49.494
and your math teacher,
Mrs. Kaiser, and Amber, duh.

47:49.536 --> 47:50.995
- Oh, my God!
- But that's all.

47:51.037 --> 47:52.956
That's all. That's all.
- Well, that's all? That's all?

47:52.997 --> 47:54.416
- Oh, actually no,
there is one more thing.

47:54.457 --> 47:57.252
[knock at door]

47:57.293 --> 47:59.754
- Hey, kiddo, how's it going?
I heard you ordered a pizza.

47:59.796 --> 48:02.549
- Oh, I didn't order any.
- Oh, my God, Tatiana?

48:02.590 --> 48:04.551
I lost my virginity to her.
- Uh, you're welcome.

48:04.592 --> 48:07.012
- You're unbelievable.
You're un-fucking-believable.

48:07.053 --> 48:09.055
You're fucking psychotic.
- Hey, that is not fair.

48:09.097 --> 48:11.725
I've heard you talk about your
pain over and over and over,

48:11.766 --> 48:13.852
night after night after night,
and it has broken my heart.

48:13.893 --> 48:16.896
I have this unique ability
to take your pain away.

48:16.938 --> 48:18.106
- Oh, guess what?

48:18.148 --> 48:19.274
It's not yours
to take away, Sheila.

48:19.315 --> 48:20.650
- It came from a good place,
Gary.

48:20.692 --> 48:21.860
- Yeah, and so did
gender-reveal parties.

48:21.901 --> 48:22.819
- You know what?
I don't need your

48:22.861 --> 48:24.279
fucking attitude right now.

48:24.320 --> 48:25.488
I'm just gonna go back and
I'm gonna tweak a few things

48:25.530 --> 48:26.990
and fix this
so this didn't happen.

48:27.032 --> 48:28.241
- Oh, well, go ahead.

48:28.283 --> 48:29.409
Go do whatever you want.
'Cause guess what?

48:29.451 --> 48:30.785
I'll still never
wanna be with you.

48:30.827 --> 48:32.328
- No, not true.
I will reset you.

48:32.370 --> 48:33.496
You'll remember nothing. Easy.

48:33.538 --> 48:34.664
- Yeah.
I will remember, actually.

48:34.706 --> 48:36.791
- No, you won't remember.
- Yeah. I will.

48:36.833 --> 48:38.710
- Really? A Sharpie, Gary?

48:38.752 --> 48:41.296
You are so dumb.
- Yeah. Sheila sucks balls.

48:41.338 --> 48:42.505
- You can't even spell.

48:42.547 --> 48:44.174
That's not going
to be there tomorrow.

48:44.215 --> 48:46.176
Do you understand?
- Fine, yeah. Maybe it won't.

48:46.217 --> 48:47.927
Maybe I won't remember
this conversation.

48:47.969 --> 48:49.179
Maybe I won't
remember this night.

48:49.220 --> 48:50.472
Maybe I won't remember
those two ladies.

48:50.513 --> 48:52.432
But I will remember
this feeling.

48:52.474 --> 48:54.267
- Gary, I've done this
hundreds of times,

48:54.309 --> 48:56.269
and you never remember.
- Oh, yeah?

48:56.311 --> 48:58.146
Were all of our dates
this shitty?

48:58.188 --> 49:00.106
- Actually no.
You used to fucking love them.

49:00.148 --> 49:01.608
- Oh, I used to
fucking love them.

49:01.649 --> 49:03.610
I wonder what happened.
Uh, I don't know. [stammers]

49:03.651 --> 49:05.695
Do you realize you can't
erase everything?

49:05.737 --> 49:08.448
- No, it's because
relationships need work, Gary.

49:08.490 --> 49:10.867
We just have to work on it.
That's all.

49:10.909 --> 49:12.952
- Well, maybe, just maybe,
you try to make things better,

49:12.994 --> 49:14.120
but you actually
make them worse.

49:14.162 --> 49:15.955
And maybe some shit sticks.

49:15.997 --> 49:17.165
- No, that's not
how this works.

49:17.207 --> 49:18.291
No, Gary,
I will prove you wrong.

49:18.333 --> 49:20.085
I will fucking prove you wrong.

49:20.126 --> 49:23.171
- Good luck!
- [screams]

49:23.213 --> 49:25.382
- Personally, I think that
he should feel touched

49:25.423 --> 49:27.509
that somebody cares so deeply

49:27.550 --> 49:32.055
to take away all the pain
of his life.

49:32.097 --> 49:36.810
- Oh, that is a really
romantic gesture.

49:36.851 --> 49:40.438
[upbeat music
playing in reverse]

49:40.480 --> 49:41.981
- Ooh.
- No, it's okay.

49:42.023 --> 49:45.652
Shh, shh. No, no. It's fine.
Shh. Please understand.

49:45.694 --> 49:46.736
- [screaming]

49:46.778 --> 49:49.364
- [screams]

49:49.406 --> 49:51.991
- Gary.
Here's your sexy pizza, Gary.

49:52.033 --> 49:54.202
Yeah. Okay.

49:54.244 --> 49:56.371
- Damn it. Wait.

49:56.413 --> 49:58.289
And then the karate instructor,

49:58.331 --> 49:59.249
he did not put up a fight
at all.

49:59.290 --> 50:00.375
It was very surprising.

50:00.417 --> 50:01.710
But then I came over
to get you.

50:01.751 --> 50:03.837
Little, cute Tatiana,
she doesn't deserve that,

50:03.878 --> 50:05.005
I couldn't do it.

50:05.046 --> 50:07.424
So you know,
that's why we're here.

50:07.465 --> 50:09.384
- Hmm.

50:09.426 --> 50:11.011
- Hello?

50:11.052 --> 50:13.013
- Oh, maybe next year, Gary.

50:13.054 --> 50:14.556
Shut the door.

50:14.597 --> 50:15.557
Come on.

50:17.892 --> 50:19.561
Cute kid.

50:19.602 --> 50:20.979
- He will be.

50:21.021 --> 50:23.606
[machine buzzing]

50:26.067 --> 50:29.195
Ugh. June. Ah.

50:29.237 --> 50:31.322
I did it. Yeah, I did it.

50:31.364 --> 50:34.784
Or I undid it, rather. Oh.

50:34.826 --> 50:36.327
[laughs] Oh.

50:36.369 --> 50:39.873
Now me and Gary can go back
to the way things used to be.

50:39.914 --> 50:41.750
[laughs]
- Okay.

50:41.791 --> 50:43.376
- Mm-hmm. "Okay," what?

50:43.418 --> 50:44.836
- In all the times
that you've done this,

50:44.878 --> 50:46.963
have things ever gone back
to the way they used to be?

50:47.005 --> 50:49.716
- Oh, God, you know, you sound
like evil Gary.

50:49.758 --> 50:50.967
RIP.

50:51.009 --> 50:53.136
Probably is covered
in black marker by now,

50:53.178 --> 50:55.638
whining, "Oh, I have
residual feelings.

50:55.680 --> 50:58.016
And when will they
ever go away?"

50:58.058 --> 51:00.101
Shit sticks my ass.

51:00.143 --> 51:02.354
- Well, some shit does stick.

51:02.395 --> 51:04.939
- Come on, no. No.
That is not fair.

51:04.981 --> 51:06.274
That is not what
we talked about.

51:06.316 --> 51:09.486
Where's the fucking manual
for this thing?

51:09.527 --> 51:10.987
- Sheila, in the 300-plus times

51:11.029 --> 51:12.155
that you've come
into this shop,

51:12.197 --> 51:13.698
have you ever once thought
to ask about me?

51:13.740 --> 51:14.991
About my life?

51:15.033 --> 51:16.493
- No.

51:16.534 --> 51:18.244
I've been very self-involved,
and I am not proud of it.

51:18.286 --> 51:21.581
- Okay.
Well, my parents wanted a boy.

51:21.623 --> 51:24.459
They wanted a boy so badly
that when I was born,

51:24.501 --> 51:26.127
they called me a mistake.

51:26.169 --> 51:27.754
And then they treated me
like a mistake.

51:27.796 --> 51:29.422
- Oh, my God.

51:29.464 --> 51:31.883
June, that's terrible.
I'm so sorry.

51:31.925 --> 51:34.260
- Yeah, so when I was old
enough to fend for myself,

51:34.302 --> 51:36.971
I murdered both of them.

51:37.013 --> 51:38.932
- What? Really?

51:38.973 --> 51:40.392
- No, not really, Sheila.

51:40.433 --> 51:42.143
But I did move to Bed-Stuy

51:42.185 --> 51:43.311
with a woman
who is now my wife,

51:43.353 --> 51:45.105
so in many ways,
I did murder them.

51:45.146 --> 51:46.481
- Oh, wow, you know,
I gotta tell you,

51:46.523 --> 51:48.108
it sounds like you handled
that shit like a champ.

51:48.149 --> 51:50.276
But hello, spoiler alert.

51:50.318 --> 51:51.444
I have a time machine.

51:51.486 --> 51:53.071
I could go back,
talk to your parents,

51:53.113 --> 51:54.280
remind them
what a treasure you are.

51:54.322 --> 51:55.448
They'll love you
from the start.

51:55.490 --> 51:58.118
And bam, trauma eliminated.

51:58.159 --> 52:00.704
- Don't fuck
with my trauma, Sheila.

52:00.745 --> 52:02.372
If I didn't have
these occasional moments

52:02.414 --> 52:04.749
of complete
and total worthlessness,

52:04.791 --> 52:08.211
I wouldn't have
this sparkling sense of humor.

52:08.253 --> 52:10.630
- Okay. Wow. Cool.
It's good for you.

52:10.672 --> 52:12.465
But you know,
for me, I have realized

52:12.507 --> 52:16.011
that I can undo anything.

52:16.052 --> 52:17.095
- No, you can't.
- Yes, I can.

52:17.137 --> 52:18.304
- No, you can't.

52:18.346 --> 52:20.306
Sometimes, people cut you,

52:20.348 --> 52:21.683
and they leave
an imprint on you

52:21.725 --> 52:23.393
that's like a gash
on your soul.

52:23.435 --> 52:25.979
You just live with it, and you
can't actually undo that.

52:26.021 --> 52:29.482
If you erase the pain,
you erase the person.

52:29.524 --> 52:32.694
Do you get it, Sheila?

52:32.736 --> 52:34.362
- No.

52:34.404 --> 52:35.655
I mean, yes.

52:35.697 --> 52:38.283
I'm just not gonna
apply it to my situation.

52:38.324 --> 52:39.367
- Why?

52:39.409 --> 52:41.661
- Because I don't know, June.

52:41.703 --> 52:43.246

lessons to their lives

it's kind of, like, enough.

I've told you is true.

really know why

1:00:49.607 --> 1:00:52.193
It's because this is sick.

You can't do that.

I can't--I can't do this.

comes here, goes back in time.

Ah, fuck.

She was fucking with me,
wasn't she?

1:04:46.928 --> 1:04:48.555
- So like love?

1:04:48.596 --> 1:04:50.098
- No, not at all.

1:04:50.140 --> 1:04:51.683
She keeps making me
do the same thing.

1:04:51.725 --> 1:04:54.185
And what's weird about it is,
I like her.

1:04:54.227 --> 1:04:56.104
- Oh, so like a relationship?

1:04:56.146 --> 1:04:58.398
- No, not like
a relationship at all.

1:04:58.440 --> 1:05:01.443
I get emotionally involved
and then somehow get hurt,

1:05:01.484 --> 1:05:03.486
and I don't even know
how many times she's done it.

1:05:03.528 --> 1:05:05.071
- So like love?

1:05:05.113 --> 1:05:09.075
- No, 'cause love is--
love is real.

1:05:09.117 --> 1:05:11.161
This is not. This is very fake.

1:05:11.202 --> 1:05:15.165
This is orchestrated.
This is inorganic.

1:05:15.206 --> 1:05:17.208
- You ever had
an organic banana?

1:05:17.250 --> 1:05:18.877
It tastes just like
a regular banana.

1:05:18.918 --> 1:05:20.712
- Okay. What?

1:05:20.754 --> 1:05:23.340
I don't know what that means,
but can we do this please?

1:05:23.381 --> 1:05:24.799
- Do you know
where you're going?

1:05:24.841 --> 1:05:28.303
- Yeah, I am going back in time
to where it all started.

1:05:28.345 --> 1:05:31.556
Wait, which is when?
When would that be?

1:05:31.598 --> 1:05:33.808
- Um, 1999?
- All right. Cool.

1:05:33.850 --> 1:05:35.935
Wait, that doesn't sound right.
Wait, June.

1:05:35.977 --> 1:05:37.437
Wait, I'm a little
claustrophobic.

1:05:37.479 --> 1:05:40.815
June. Oh, no.
June, I gotta piss.

1:05:40.857 --> 1:05:42.484
Can I piss back in the future?

- Gary?

1:06:09.594 --> 1:06:11.096
- Yeah.

1:06:11.137 --> 1:06:14.099
Oh, she's too young.
I came back too far.

1:06:14.140 --> 1:06:16.059
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I gotta go.

1:06:16.101 --> 1:06:18.395

1:06:18.436 --> 1:06:20.188

this man while he's working.

to when you're like 16 or 17

1:06:35.620 --> 1:06:37.330
so I can, you know,
catch you when you were

1:06:37.372 --> 1:06:39.374
developing your crazy
and maybe help you out,

1:06:39.416 --> 1:06:40.667
but you're way too young,

1:06:40.709 --> 1:06:42.669

yell at a little kid

for my daughter.

She can be quite dramatic.

1:06:50.552 --> 1:06:54.723
She got that
from her father, obviously.

that's not gonna work

1:06:58.309 --> 1:06:59.644

1:07:11.364 --> 1:07:13.408

Mommy's eyeliner?

all that noise!

It's okay.

Okay? It's okay.

1:07:42.854 --> 1:07:44.397

messy sometimes.

to be messy sometimes.

It's okay, it's okay.

It's always gonna be okay.

1:08:05.043 --> 1:08:07.003
I don't know how you did it,
but you got it in there.

1:08:07.045 --> 1:08:09.130

I'm running late.

1:08:09.172 --> 1:08:11.091
Is it fixed?

1:08:11.132 --> 1:08:13.009

1:08:17.806 --> 1:08:19.140
Okay.

1:08:19.182 --> 1:08:21.017
Did that make you feel
a little better?

1:08:42.163 --> 1:08:44.082
Hey, I just wanted
to come thank you

1:08:44.124 --> 1:08:46.918
for the last few months,
or years.

1:08:46.960 --> 1:08:49.504
I don't know how long
it's been, but, um,

1:08:49.546 --> 1:08:53.466
I've been thinking a lot
about giving up control,

1:08:53.508 --> 1:08:56.261
you know, and I realize
that that's just not me.

1:08:56.302 --> 1:08:58.304
I can't do that.

1:08:58.346 --> 1:09:02.809
So this is me saying
thank you, and goodbye.

1:09:02.851 --> 1:09:06.021
That's a good color.
That's my favorite color.

1:09:06.062 --> 1:09:07.272
That's a good one.

1:09:16.197 --> 1:09:17.741
Sorry, just one more thing.

1:09:17.782 --> 1:09:21.828
June, you would've
made a great man,

1:09:21.870 --> 1:09:26.958
but you make
an even better woman.

1:09:27.000 --> 1:09:29.711
And I just want you to know

1:09:29.753 --> 1:09:32.213
that it has been
an honor to know you

1:09:32.255 --> 1:09:37.719
and all your perfect,
perfect weirdness.

1:09:37.761 --> 1:09:39.179
You are perfect.

1:09:39.220 --> 1:09:40.764
And you are not a mistake.

1:09:45.727 --> 1:09:46.936

I fixed everything.

1:10:01.409 --> 1:10:02.744
I think I fixed her.

1:10:02.786 --> 1:10:05.246
It turns out she just had,
like, a, you know,

1:10:05.288 --> 1:10:06.873
crappy '80s mom.

1:10:06.915 --> 1:10:08.208
- Um, yeah.

1:10:08.249 --> 1:10:09.584
I don't think you fixed her.

1:10:09.626 --> 1:10:11.169
You did just miss her, though.

1:10:11.211 --> 1:10:12.295
And she didn't sound so good,

1:10:12.337 --> 1:10:16.383
so you should probably
go after her.

1:10:16.424 --> 1:10:18.927

It's so confusing.

Wait! Sheila, wait.

you doing here?

- Hey, look at me.

1:11:31.374 --> 1:11:32.709
Hey.

1:11:32.751 --> 1:11:34.419
It's okay for things
to be messy sometimes.

1:11:34.461 --> 1:11:37.464
Okay? Remember?

1:11:37.505 --> 1:11:38.715
- Yes, that's very nice.

1:11:38.757 --> 1:11:40.216
That doesn't work
on me anymore.

1:11:40.258 --> 1:11:42.635
Like everything in my life,
it has lost all meaning,

1:11:42.677 --> 1:11:45.388
and I would just really like
for today to be--

1:11:45.430 --> 1:11:47.390
- Hey, relax.

1:11:47.432 --> 1:11:49.309
Relax. Relax.

1:11:49.351 --> 1:11:50.894
We'll just wait for tomorrow.

1:11:50.935 --> 1:11:53.688
We will wait.
It's almost tomorrow.

1:11:53.730 --> 1:11:55.815
- Gary, fuck tomorrow.
- Don't you fucking say that.

1:11:55.857 --> 1:11:57.650
- Oh, my God.
- Sheila, come on.

1:11:57.692 --> 1:12:00.320
- There is not a future
that I want to be part of.

1:12:00.362 --> 1:12:01.988
Please understand that, okay?

1:12:02.030 --> 1:12:03.656
This world is such
a fucked up place,

1:12:03.698 --> 1:12:07.410
and I had, like, a thousand
chances to make today okay,

1:12:07.452 --> 1:12:09.496
and I fucked every single
one of them up,

1:12:09.537 --> 1:12:11.498
and I don't want that
to happen tomorrow.

1:12:11.539 --> 1:12:13.416
So why am I gonna
stay for tomorrow?

1:12:13.458 --> 1:12:14.959
Please go home.

1:12:15.001 --> 1:12:16.920
Please go home
and just live your life

1:12:16.961 --> 1:12:20.632
and let me end mine
the way I would like to.

1:12:20.674 --> 1:12:22.759
- Not a chance. Not a chance.
- Oh, my God, Gary.

1:12:22.801 --> 1:12:24.052
- No.
- Go home.

1:12:24.094 --> 1:12:25.512
- I'm not going anywhere.

1:12:25.553 --> 1:12:28.181
- Go home!
- I'm not going anywhere!

1:12:28.223 --> 1:12:30.392
I'll stay here all night.

1:12:30.433 --> 1:12:32.394
I don't give a fuck.

1:12:57.252 --> 1:13:01.297
- You cannot stand here for
the rest of your life, okay?

1:13:01.339 --> 1:13:04.968
Eventually, you have to go take
a piss or order a sandwich.

1:13:05.010 --> 1:13:07.554
And I'm still gonna
jump off this bridge.

1:13:07.595 --> 1:13:11.057
So please get the fuck
out of my face.

1:13:12.267 --> 1:13:17.355

that I saw the future?

1:13:17.397 --> 1:13:19.190

anymore, Gary.

1:13:19.232 --> 1:13:20.442
This isn't funny anymore. Stop.

1:13:20.483 --> 1:13:21.735

I saw the future.

1:13:21.776 --> 1:13:24.863
- No, you didn't.
- Yes, I did.

1:13:24.904 --> 1:13:27.032

to send it to the future.

She just switched the knob
to the F button.

1:13:30.744 --> 1:13:33.288

you're lying.

Maybe it's not great, okay?

1:13:39.002 --> 1:13:42.589
Maybe it's a little messy,
but who the fuck cares?

1:13:42.630 --> 1:13:44.758
It's a mess worth
being around for.

1:13:44.799 --> 1:13:46.593
- Gary, if you saw
the future,

1:13:46.634 --> 1:13:48.094
you would know that
I'm not in it.

1:13:48.136 --> 1:13:50.472

You are in it.

1:13:50.513 --> 1:13:52.140
- No, I'm not.
- And guess what?

1:13:52.182 --> 1:13:54.142
You're not jumping off
of this bridge.

1:13:54.184 --> 1:13:59.606

I am jumping off this bridge.

- Yes, I am!

go to the other side.

You haven't seen the future.

1:14:23.171 --> 1:14:25.465

to prove it to you?

1:14:25.507 --> 1:14:26.883
- You can't.

1:14:33.556 --> 1:14:35.016

tell the difference.
