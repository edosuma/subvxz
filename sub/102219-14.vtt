WEBVTT

00:09.009 --> 00:11.803
…because crime isn't just
something that's downtown.

00:11.886 --> 00:13.430
It's in our community.

00:13.513 --> 00:16.182
And if we don't do something
about it right now,

00:16.266 --> 00:20.687
the robberies,
the drug dealing, the gangs,

00:20.770 --> 00:23.231
they're going to show up in our backyard

00:23.314 --> 00:26.234
or our front steps or even our kitchens.

00:26.901 --> 00:28.111
And, personally,

00:28.903 --> 00:32.532
I want to live in a world
where I don't have to lock my front door

00:32.615 --> 00:35.577
or watch my back
every time I go to the grocery store

00:35.660 --> 00:39.581
or worry that someone's parked
on my street waiting for me to leave

00:39.664 --> 00:43.251
so they can just come in
and take whatever they want.

00:44.127 --> 00:46.713
I want to go back to that Ashfield,

00:47.547 --> 00:48.965
and I know you do, too.

00:50.008 --> 00:52.510
And that's why
I'm running for City Council,

00:52.594 --> 00:55.764
to proudly represent Ward 5.

00:59.142 --> 01:01.144
[music playing over tablet]

01:01.227 --> 01:02.312
How was it?

01:04.439 --> 01:05.440
It was long.

01:05.940 --> 01:07.817
Did you understand it?

01:08.401 --> 01:09.903
Parts were funny.

01:11.821 --> 01:14.949
-You're really doing this, huh?
-Was it that bad?

01:15.033 --> 01:16.367
[sighs]

01:18.161 --> 01:22.248
Uh… The principal wants to see us again.

01:22.332 --> 01:23.291
Didn't do it.

01:26.252 --> 01:27.670
[scoffs]

01:27.754 --> 01:28.922
[Beth sighs]

01:41.601 --> 01:42.602
[sighs]

01:46.648 --> 01:48.942
[Dave] Okay. One more time, from the top.

01:50.401 --> 01:51.694
Street crime.

01:51.778 --> 01:55.115
You got your petty theft, drugs,
carjacking, what have you.

01:55.949 --> 02:00.537
Now this is where you ladies come in.
Some of that money gets washed right here.

02:00.620 --> 02:02.622
The rest turns into counterfeit.

02:04.624 --> 02:08.795
Then it goes across the border
and comes back clean.

02:08.878 --> 02:10.588
But now they gotta launder it

02:10.672 --> 02:13.633
or else the IRS
starts asking all these questions.

02:13.716 --> 02:15.969
So you have your little mom and pops,

02:16.052 --> 02:20.390
electrical companies,
plumbing, materials, construction.

02:20.473 --> 02:22.016
Oh, I'm the banker.

02:22.100 --> 02:23.518
-Oh.
-Uh-huh.

02:23.601 --> 02:25.979
Those same companies pay for protection,

02:26.062 --> 02:27.730
kickbacks to your boy.

02:29.149 --> 02:31.067
He's not our boy. Why does everyone--

02:31.151 --> 02:32.819
And in return, they get…

02:33.361 --> 02:35.363
-Body glitter.
-Contracts.

02:36.573 --> 02:37.824
From a shell company.

02:37.907 --> 02:40.410
Owned by guess who?

02:41.744 --> 02:44.497
Gang friend's fairy godfather?

02:45.081 --> 02:46.708
That's what we're calling him?

02:46.791 --> 02:47.667
Works for me.

02:47.750 --> 02:50.962
-This is where it gets a bit complicated.
-Oh, jeez.

02:51.045 --> 02:55.300
The shell companies are hired
by the city to build whatever projects

02:55.383 --> 02:57.552
Gang Fairy Godfather could get approved.

02:57.635 --> 02:59.554
Which is why he needs you in that seat.

03:00.346 --> 03:02.640
But we don't know
what his next project is.

03:02.724 --> 03:04.642
Which is why <i>we</i> need you in that seat.

03:04.726 --> 03:06.102
To bring them all down!

03:09.230 --> 03:10.106
Any questions?

03:13.943 --> 03:14.944
Yeah.

03:15.028 --> 03:18.865
How much of this do we have
to understand to get our deal back?

03:20.491 --> 03:21.951
-None of it.
-[sighs]

03:22.035 --> 03:24.787
Good. 'Cause you lost me with that cutlet.

03:25.580 --> 03:26.789
There's no deal.

03:29.125 --> 03:30.668
-He's here on vacation.
-So are you.

03:30.752 --> 03:32.712
-Not really.
-Well, I'm calling it a vacation.

03:32.795 --> 03:37.008
Mmm, I'm calling it "suspended for
misplacing a suitcase full of fake cash

03:37.091 --> 03:39.218
while having drinks with a 'friend.'"

03:39.844 --> 03:44.474
So just to be clear,
there's nothing in it for us.

03:44.557 --> 03:47.268
How about not going away for all of this?

03:47.352 --> 03:49.437
Now, would that be to a Canadian prison?

03:50.480 --> 03:51.689
Does that matter?

03:51.773 --> 03:53.358
I think I could handle it.

03:55.109 --> 03:57.362
Can we keep our cut from all this?

04:00.406 --> 04:02.700
-Yeah.
-We all go home winners.

04:04.661 --> 04:06.996
-What if I can't win?
-You're a natural.

04:08.039 --> 04:09.916
She doesn't know jack about politics.

04:09.999 --> 04:12.794
She's great at pretending
to be something she's not.

04:12.877 --> 04:15.255
Okay, look, there's nothing to win.

04:15.338 --> 04:18.049
You're just filling an open seat.

04:18.132 --> 04:19.008
That was mine.

04:20.927 --> 04:22.512
Just get the signatures.

04:24.305 --> 04:26.224
-Ninety-seven, ninety-eight…
-[grunting]

04:26.307 --> 04:27.976
-…ninety-nine, one hundred!
-[groans]

04:28.059 --> 04:31.062
-[all cheering]
-And I nominate my buddy, Bob Allen,

04:31.145 --> 04:33.523
-a hundred pushups, a hundred seconds.
-[cell phone beeps]

04:33.606 --> 04:34.732
Why are you doing this?

04:35.316 --> 04:37.402
[grunts] He called me out on Insta.

04:37.485 --> 04:39.153
Uh, whoa. Everyone at the office did it.

04:39.237 --> 04:40.363
So what?

04:40.446 --> 04:43.574
So, if I flake, I'd look like
I don't wanna save teacup pigs.

04:45.743 --> 04:46.953
Do you believe this?

04:47.578 --> 04:48.705
I did it last week.

04:49.956 --> 04:51.291
All right, show of hands.

04:51.374 --> 04:54.127
Who here even knows
what a teacup pig looks like?

04:56.546 --> 04:57.714
A teacup pig?

04:59.257 --> 05:00.925
-Thank you.
-[Dean] What's up, boys?

05:01.009 --> 05:02.468
Can I talk to you guys for a sec?

05:03.136 --> 05:03.970
Yeah.

05:04.053 --> 05:05.972
Don't worry, we won't nominate you.

05:06.055 --> 05:09.183
No, now you have to.
'Cause I don't wanna be the only one.

05:11.269 --> 05:14.522
Um, so where are we at?

05:15.231 --> 05:17.358
-With what?
-You know, my whole situation.

05:17.442 --> 05:18.693
-Working on it.
-Yeah.

05:18.776 --> 05:22.113
-Okay, you guys say that every time.
-[Z sighs]

05:22.196 --> 05:24.741
[scoffs] You can't just
stick it in Lady Justice.

05:24.824 --> 05:26.492
Yeah, she's got to want it.

05:27.285 --> 05:29.162
My wife is running for City Council.

05:30.621 --> 05:31.622
What?

05:32.582 --> 05:35.418
-Why?
-I don't know. Civic pride.

05:35.918 --> 05:37.962
Just what the city needs,
another woman on top.

05:38.046 --> 05:40.048
I don't want her to be humiliated.

05:40.631 --> 05:41.549
That's not on us.

05:41.632 --> 05:43.217
In front of the whole world.

05:43.301 --> 05:44.844
-You backing out?
-Hell no.

05:48.222 --> 05:49.640
I don't know. Uh, look…

05:50.308 --> 05:53.061
Maybe… You know,
maybe we just take a beat.

05:54.812 --> 05:55.813
Hey, Darryl.

05:57.148 --> 05:59.150
-This is Dean.
-Hey.

06:01.652 --> 06:02.653
Who's that?

06:03.696 --> 06:06.032
You don't know your friendly County DA?

06:08.201 --> 06:09.410
He's one of us?

06:09.494 --> 06:11.662
[scoffs] How do you think
I win all my cases?

06:11.746 --> 06:13.623
Like we said, we're on it.

06:14.248 --> 06:16.626
-We can do whatever you want.
-Yeah, your call.

06:17.627 --> 06:18.920
You good?

06:21.172 --> 06:23.800
I want it to be as quick
and painless as possible.

06:23.883 --> 06:25.009
You got it, Dean.

06:26.761 --> 06:29.097
But, uh, don't bring it up here,
though. Okay?

06:29.180 --> 06:30.223
[Dean] Sure.

06:30.306 --> 06:33.643
If this gets out, it'd be more
than just our bar cards on the line.

06:38.689 --> 06:39.649
[Kevin] Mmm.

06:40.858 --> 06:43.277
-Oh, hey, can you chop the, uh--
-Already done.

06:43.361 --> 06:44.529
[whooshes]

06:44.612 --> 06:47.198
Juliennes. Nice.

06:47.281 --> 06:49.075
Only took two Band-Aids this time.

06:49.158 --> 06:51.369
-Oh, yeah. Looks great.
-[Annie] Pretty good, right?

06:51.452 --> 06:53.162
-Just in time, BM.
-Hi.

06:53.246 --> 06:55.331
Can that not be my nickname?

06:55.414 --> 06:57.333
-It's your initials.
-Speaking of… Here.

06:57.416 --> 06:59.168
Also something you flush.

06:59.252 --> 07:01.129
Auntie Beth needs you to sign this.

07:01.754 --> 07:04.340
Uh, I'm not even old enough to vote.

07:04.423 --> 07:05.800
Well, get Dad to do it.

07:05.883 --> 07:08.052
He's in Petoskey. Some corporate retreat.

07:08.136 --> 07:10.096
-What about Nance?
-She's in bed.

07:10.179 --> 07:12.390
-Oh, she sick or something?
-Depressed.

07:12.473 --> 07:15.685
'Cause she lost her honorary
parking spot at Tiffany's? [chuckles]

07:16.561 --> 07:18.604
More like her entire purpose in life.

07:20.690 --> 07:22.024
I'm gonna go change.

07:26.904 --> 07:28.239
Ow.

07:28.322 --> 07:29.532
What's wrong?

07:29.615 --> 07:30.950
[scoffs] Nothing.

07:31.534 --> 07:33.327
-Oh, is it your eyebrow zit?
-[gasps]

07:33.953 --> 07:34.996
You can see it?

07:35.079 --> 07:37.123
Dude, it's like a third eye.

07:37.206 --> 07:39.667
-[sighs] I've tried everything.
-Those are the worst.

07:39.750 --> 07:41.794
-It won't go away.
-Yeah, those kill.

07:41.878 --> 07:44.464
[sighs] It's, like,
holding my face hostage.

07:46.549 --> 07:48.050
-Let me at it.
-Absolutely not!

07:48.134 --> 07:49.010
You'll feel better.

07:49.093 --> 07:50.970
-[both laugh]
-That's disgusting.

07:51.053 --> 07:53.306
Okay, here. Just trust me.

07:53.389 --> 07:54.932
-What are you doing?
-Come here.

07:55.016 --> 07:58.352
We just need to, uh…
open up the pores a little bit.

07:58.436 --> 07:59.896
-Are you serious?
-Yeah.

08:01.522 --> 08:02.773
Hmm…

08:02.857 --> 08:05.067
-Just like a spa.
-Mmm-hmm.

08:06.736 --> 08:09.447
Okay, can we stop?
My eyeballs are hard-boiled.

08:10.990 --> 08:12.325
This is ridiculous.

08:12.909 --> 08:15.411
-How's it feel?
-Still bad.

08:16.245 --> 08:17.538
-Okay.
-Don't do it.

08:17.622 --> 08:19.665
-You don't have to.
-I'm going in.

08:19.749 --> 08:20.583
No.

08:20.666 --> 08:22.293
What if it squirts on your eyeball?

08:22.376 --> 08:24.462
It'll make our night more interesting.

08:24.545 --> 08:25.588
-[sighs] Kevin.
-Annie.

08:25.671 --> 08:27.298
Gentle. Gentle.

08:28.132 --> 08:29.884
-Oh!
-[Annie] Ow!

08:31.052 --> 08:34.263
-Ew!
-[both chuckle]

08:34.347 --> 08:38.059
-How's it feel now?
-It feels better. Okay?

08:39.227 --> 08:41.437
-Hungry?
-Not especially.

08:42.313 --> 08:44.982
-Another beer?
-That, I would do.

08:45.066 --> 08:46.067
All right.

08:55.451 --> 08:57.036
Just sign at the bottom there.

08:59.747 --> 09:02.250
-How many do you have?
-[Beth] I'm getting there.

09:04.252 --> 09:06.462
Wanna hear
where I stand on the issues again?

09:07.171 --> 09:08.005
Just…

09:08.631 --> 09:11.467
really puts us out there, you know?

09:12.843 --> 09:14.971
You just have to
hold my purse a few times.

09:15.054 --> 09:16.430
[ankle monitor beeps]

09:19.433 --> 09:21.394
[sighs] So…

09:23.020 --> 09:24.814
wouldn't have to dig too deep.

09:25.398 --> 09:26.983
The police records are sealed.

09:27.608 --> 09:29.443
That's not really what I'm worried about.

09:31.445 --> 09:32.947
Then what is it? [sighs]

09:38.035 --> 09:38.911
I just…

09:41.163 --> 09:43.541
I don't want the whole thing
to blow up in your face.

09:46.919 --> 09:48.212
Then wear long pants.

09:51.132 --> 09:52.174
[water running]

10:08.399 --> 10:11.652
-Who's Bongo Man?
-Kevin's friend from the park.

10:12.320 --> 10:15.239
-It can't be his given name.
-It's what he goes by.

10:15.740 --> 10:16.907
Did you get his ID?

10:18.075 --> 10:19.035
I saw the bongo.

10:20.911 --> 10:23.998
Oh, excuse me.
Where'd you guys get your signatures from?

10:24.081 --> 10:25.374
-Church.
-School.

10:25.458 --> 10:26.834
-Work.
-Kroger.

10:26.917 --> 10:29.545
-We both hit the Kroger.
-Two different days.

10:29.629 --> 10:31.714
Now we have all the demos covered, okay?

10:32.381 --> 10:34.133
[indistinct chatter in distance]

10:36.719 --> 10:38.554
So much for this being low-key.

10:39.847 --> 10:42.516
Maybe Gang Fairy Godfather
tipped them off.

10:43.601 --> 10:47.229
But I… I didn't, like,
put on makeup and…

10:47.313 --> 10:48.564
It's fine. You look hot.

10:48.648 --> 10:50.274
[Beth] I'm supposed to look like a mom.

10:50.900 --> 10:52.026
-Hot mom.
-[reporter] Denise!

10:52.109 --> 10:55.488
We can't just give this seat away.

10:55.571 --> 10:58.741
Especially to a woman
who doesn't share our values.

10:58.824 --> 11:02.078
Which is why
I am also running for City Council.

11:02.161 --> 11:05.456
To ensure that
our wonderful community is represented by

11:05.539 --> 11:07.958
someone who understands
what our children need.

11:08.042 --> 11:11.337
How do you feel about the proposed
dress code for public school?

11:11.420 --> 11:13.422
Looks like you just got out-mom'ed, bruh.

11:13.506 --> 11:15.132
[Denise] …children should wear uniforms.

11:17.718 --> 11:20.763
[woman] <i>Do you know what it means</i>
<i>to be Ashfield proud?</i>

11:21.597 --> 11:24.100
<i>-Denise Carpenter does.</i>
-[patriotic music playing]

11:24.183 --> 11:27.770
[woman] <i>Enriching</i>
<i>the lives of those in need,</i>

11:27.853 --> 11:31.065
<i>helping to shape the developing mind</i>

11:31.690 --> 11:34.985
<i>and caring for those</i>
<i>entering the autumn of life.</i>

11:36.153 --> 11:42.159
<i>She believes the pulse of our city</i>
<i>comes from service, faith and family.</i>

11:43.327 --> 11:47.957
<i>Because her heart's</i>
<i>always been in the same place,</i>

11:48.040 --> 11:50.376
<i>with the people of Ashfield.</i>

11:52.336 --> 11:53.963
I'm Ashfield proud.

11:54.839 --> 11:56.966
[woman] <i>Paid for by Family First Alliance.</i>

12:01.262 --> 12:02.805
Yeah, that sucks.

12:04.640 --> 12:08.436
And why does everyone look
so much more important in slow-mo?

12:08.519 --> 12:09.395
[chuckles]

12:10.146 --> 12:13.482
I know, even the flag waving
got me a little choked up.

12:14.400 --> 12:16.277
You said it was a shoo-in.

12:16.360 --> 12:18.571
That was before Jesus got involved.

12:20.698 --> 12:24.410
Well, can you, like,
grease some palms or whatever?

12:25.286 --> 12:28.080
-To get you elected?
-Isn't that what you guys do?

12:28.164 --> 12:31.041
[chuckles] That's not really
how democracy works.

12:31.125 --> 12:34.003
Okay, so all your projects and whatever…

12:35.880 --> 12:37.798
-What about them?
-[Beth] They're all…

12:39.800 --> 12:41.051
above board?

12:46.515 --> 12:50.769
Now, this isn't zoning a garden for kids
or building a parking structure.

12:50.853 --> 12:53.856
So, how can I help you
if you can't help me get elected?

12:53.939 --> 12:56.942
-Money.
-And where is that pot of gold?

12:57.026 --> 12:57.902
Hmm…

12:58.861 --> 12:59.695
[clicks tongue]

13:01.989 --> 13:03.407
Nowhere good.

13:04.950 --> 13:06.035
I'm used to it.

13:09.163 --> 13:10.831
Donors, Elizabeth.

13:12.833 --> 13:14.752
And how do we get to their gold?

13:15.419 --> 13:16.879
Take 'em to your church.

13:18.631 --> 13:20.049
[dance music playing]

13:26.430 --> 13:28.432
How's your civic pride tonight?

13:28.516 --> 13:29.433
Solid.

13:29.517 --> 13:31.268
I'm going to need to see it.

13:32.978 --> 13:34.146
All donations.

13:34.230 --> 13:35.981
Tax deductible.

13:41.529 --> 13:43.280
Keep the bottom for your receipt.

13:45.241 --> 13:47.701
-[Annie] Twenty bucks.
-What's it get me?

13:47.785 --> 13:49.119
Safer streets.

13:50.996 --> 13:53.582
That's why I would expand
our neighborhood watch,

13:53.666 --> 13:55.918
because the best eyes on the street
are your neighbors'.

13:56.001 --> 13:59.505
You can't always trust the police,
so make sure your tax dollars

13:59.588 --> 14:03.050
are going to the programs
that will help protect your community.

14:04.260 --> 14:06.220
So can I count on your support?

14:06.303 --> 14:07.471
Yeah, sure.

14:08.722 --> 14:11.600
Come on, you can do better than that
to support our girl.

14:19.441 --> 14:20.484
Hello?

14:22.528 --> 14:23.571
Anybody home?

14:26.949 --> 14:28.576
I, uh… I used the key.

14:29.869 --> 14:32.872
Let's see. Rise and shine.

14:34.290 --> 14:35.749
-Hmm.
-[Nancy moans]

14:37.585 --> 14:39.420
[Annie] Oh, my God!

14:39.503 --> 14:41.463
[Nancy] Leave me alone!

14:42.131 --> 14:43.966
Do you know where your baby is?

14:44.550 --> 14:45.926
[Nancy] With someone who showers.

14:48.721 --> 14:50.139
Do you know what day it is?

14:52.725 --> 14:54.101
Does it matter?

14:54.602 --> 14:55.519
Yes.

14:55.603 --> 14:58.564
Because it is spa day. Huh?

14:59.189 --> 15:00.149
Look at this.

15:00.733 --> 15:01.567
Eyes…

15:02.484 --> 15:05.404
face, hair…

15:06.363 --> 15:09.783
-and even… body.
-[vibrates]

15:11.911 --> 15:14.246
-Let's… Come here. Give me your foot.
-[vibrating]

15:14.330 --> 15:17.875
-Where's that little foot?
-No. Stop. What's wrong with you?

15:17.958 --> 15:20.628
-What is wrong with you?
-I lost everything.

15:20.711 --> 15:22.588
[scoffs] Well, so get it back.

15:23.797 --> 15:28.010
It's not… It's not like Tupperware
that someone borrowed.

15:28.093 --> 15:29.386
[sighs]

15:29.470 --> 15:32.598
Look, you know,
businesses fail. It happens.

15:34.808 --> 15:36.226
You don't get it.

15:36.310 --> 15:37.561
[scoffs] Why don't you try me?

15:38.687 --> 15:39.897
[device vibrates]

15:46.111 --> 15:49.448
I was super into
this senior in high school.

15:49.531 --> 15:53.243
He was super into this
<i>Mortal Kombat</i> game at our 7-Eleven.

15:53.744 --> 15:58.958
Every day before school,
I went and I practiced to impress him.

16:00.000 --> 16:01.085
And did it work?

16:01.168 --> 16:03.420
-We went to prom.
-Hail.

16:03.504 --> 16:06.757
Also, I had
the highest score for seven years

16:06.840 --> 16:08.884
before some dick unplugged the machine.

16:08.968 --> 16:10.177
You know it was him.

16:12.096 --> 16:13.097
[Nancy sighs]

16:15.015 --> 16:16.016
I never fail.

16:20.771 --> 16:21.814
[sighs]

16:25.526 --> 16:27.027
What about your marriage?

16:27.111 --> 16:28.028
Excuse me?

16:29.822 --> 16:32.157
I mean, he did bone me.

16:32.992 --> 16:34.535
-Okay.
-More than once.

16:34.618 --> 16:37.705
-Are you serious?
-While you were pregnant.

16:37.788 --> 16:40.332
-It was a rough patch.
-[Annie] I don't know.

16:41.125 --> 16:44.253
Sounds like
a pretty big fail, if you ask me.

16:46.005 --> 16:47.423
Got him back, didn't I?

16:50.175 --> 16:51.051
Exactly.

16:56.056 --> 16:57.558
[chuckles] God.

16:59.435 --> 17:02.896
You didn't have any better example
for your teachable moment?

17:05.899 --> 17:07.818
Look, you just…

17:08.694 --> 17:10.612
You just hit another rough patch.

17:12.239 --> 17:13.866
It's so embarrassing.

17:17.244 --> 17:18.078
Hey.

17:21.415 --> 17:22.624
It's gonna be okay.

17:24.585 --> 17:25.419
[sniffles]

17:26.378 --> 17:28.297
I'll leave you to your pity party.

17:29.715 --> 17:33.886
Just remember,
massager, not just for your foot.

17:36.722 --> 17:39.391
-[clears throat]
-I can't pay you back for any of this.

17:40.225 --> 17:42.269
It's cool. I used CVS points.

17:47.149 --> 17:47.983
[vibrating]

17:48.067 --> 17:50.319
[dance music playing in distance]

17:53.947 --> 17:55.324
[people cheering]

17:57.117 --> 17:58.035
[Rio] Cute.

17:58.660 --> 17:59.828
[Beth] Twenty bucks.

18:00.662 --> 18:01.997
Yeah, no, I'm good.

18:03.082 --> 18:04.208
Bumper sticker?

18:04.291 --> 18:06.126
I'll just take my dry cleaning.

18:07.795 --> 18:09.213
It's all boxed up.

18:13.300 --> 18:14.802
Let me ask you something.

18:16.178 --> 18:17.596
What's in it for you?

18:18.222 --> 18:19.223
What do you mean?

18:19.306 --> 18:21.433
I mean, why do you want to run this town?

18:21.517 --> 18:23.560
Nick said I would be good at it.

18:23.644 --> 18:24.853
Ah…

18:24.937 --> 18:27.314
-Nick, huh?
-Yeah, your genetic relation.

18:28.190 --> 18:30.609
-Whatever you call him.
-[Rio] Pretty smart guy.

18:30.692 --> 18:33.320
Yeah, he seems to know how it all works.

18:34.822 --> 18:37.491
So you just do whatever Nick says, huh?

18:41.286 --> 18:42.287
Don't you?

18:46.458 --> 18:47.793
That's what you think?

18:51.213 --> 18:54.216
I just know he's in City Hall
and you're in a strip club.

18:57.594 --> 18:58.637
Mmm-hmm.

19:00.848 --> 19:01.807
[sighs]

19:01.890 --> 19:03.517
That's some bag you got.

19:03.600 --> 19:05.769
Yeah, he's a pretty smart guy.

19:06.979 --> 19:08.147
Oh, no doubt.

19:12.901 --> 19:14.236
Box that up for me, too.

19:16.697 --> 19:17.656
[sighs]

19:18.448 --> 19:19.741
This isn't yours.

19:19.825 --> 19:22.578
-It's my strip club.
-This is campaign money.

19:22.661 --> 19:25.247
Oh, you didn't get this far
by taking handouts, right?

19:27.583 --> 19:29.918
-I need this to run.
-[Rio] Oh, yeah?

19:31.211 --> 19:32.254
Let's see.

19:35.048 --> 19:36.216
You can't.

19:38.427 --> 19:40.053
Take it up with City Hall.

19:50.772 --> 19:52.608
[upbeat music playing over speakers]

19:52.691 --> 19:53.734
[door closes]

20:02.659 --> 20:05.579
-That make you feel good?
-Yo, get him a scotch.

20:06.121 --> 20:07.998
-Really showed me, huh?
-Top-shelf.

20:08.081 --> 20:10.209
-Any shelf is fine.
-[Rio] Oh-ho!

20:11.001 --> 20:12.794
Look who's trying to keep it real now.

20:14.004 --> 20:15.214
Make it off the top.

20:17.507 --> 20:19.426
You don't get
what we're trying to do here.

20:19.509 --> 20:21.803
Whoa, ain't no "we."

20:22.304 --> 20:23.805
What <i>you're</i> trying to do.

20:24.306 --> 20:26.266
There'd be no shelf if it wasn't for me.

20:26.350 --> 20:29.186
-Fine. Drink the cheap stuff.
-No shelves at all.

20:30.437 --> 20:34.107
You'd be on the city's salary
if it wasn't for me. Don't forget that.

20:35.859 --> 20:37.527
You think you'd have any of this?

20:42.157 --> 20:43.825
You think you'd have her?

20:47.663 --> 20:49.289
-Just know one thing.
-What?

20:50.165 --> 20:52.501
-This isn't about her.
-What's it about?

20:54.127 --> 20:55.921
It won't be me doing the time.

20:58.674 --> 21:00.550
'Cause you'd make sure it was me.

21:04.304 --> 21:05.764
[laughs]

21:07.933 --> 21:09.101
[sighs]

21:09.935 --> 21:12.854
-No. I got this.
-No, no, no.

21:14.982 --> 21:16.566
Better keep what you can.

21:20.279 --> 21:21.280
[clicks tongue]

21:24.992 --> 21:27.286
[Annie] Can we get
the donor guys back to the club?

21:27.369 --> 21:28.954
And tell 'em what?

21:29.037 --> 21:30.664
"Oopsie, we lost it all"?

21:32.082 --> 21:34.668
Okay. What about a car wash?

21:34.751 --> 21:38.463
Do you have any idea
how much a minute of airtime costs?

21:39.089 --> 21:41.842
Paid for that sick trip
in high school we took to Toronto.

21:41.925 --> 21:43.427
Thought you hated Canada.

21:44.052 --> 21:44.928
Except Toronto.

21:45.929 --> 21:48.098
-Seriously?
-Has the best science center in the world.

21:48.724 --> 21:51.310
Hmm. You'd have to wash
every car in the city.

21:51.393 --> 21:55.731
Can we just skip the part where we pretend
there's any legitimate way to do this?

21:57.858 --> 21:59.943
Fine, but we gotta change it up.

22:00.027 --> 22:01.611
-New masks?
-Like Halloween?

22:01.695 --> 22:04.948
Or like those motorcycle helmets
with the mirrored visors?

22:05.032 --> 22:06.616
You can't hear a thing in those.

22:07.659 --> 22:10.287
Sorry, where are you buying
a Halloween mask this time of year?

22:10.370 --> 22:11.997
Uh, Amazon.

22:12.080 --> 22:13.623
We can't rob.

22:16.084 --> 22:17.419
We've never carjacked.

22:18.045 --> 22:19.546
Still need a mask for that.

22:19.629 --> 22:23.050
[chuckling] You guys,
my entire platform is anti-crime.

22:26.762 --> 22:27.888
So?

22:28.472 --> 22:30.307
So we can't do crime.

22:31.808 --> 22:34.728
No, we just can't do crime
and then get caught.

22:34.811 --> 22:36.980
Hmm, it's the end of an era.

22:37.731 --> 22:40.692
Hey, Principal Clark's waiting.
You gotta hustle.

22:40.776 --> 22:41.693
Aren't you coming?

22:41.777 --> 22:45.447
Unless we're meeting on the corner
of Delaney and Third, it's all you.

22:46.573 --> 22:48.867
You're right. Sorry. [sighs]

22:48.950 --> 22:50.535
What did he do this time?

22:50.619 --> 22:53.288
Your son's very popular
with all the students.

22:54.164 --> 22:55.248
That's good.

22:55.916 --> 22:58.376
Uh, they think he's hilarious.

22:58.460 --> 22:59.294
He is.

22:59.920 --> 23:03.340
-And also very creative.
-Okay, what am I doing here?

23:05.300 --> 23:09.471
I'm in the lounge the other day
when I hear… honking.

23:10.555 --> 23:11.431
Okay.

23:11.973 --> 23:12.849
All day.

23:13.767 --> 23:14.976
It doesn't end.

23:15.060 --> 23:15.977
Right.

23:16.770 --> 23:20.232
So, eventually I got up,
went outside to see what was going on

23:20.315 --> 23:23.527
and Kenny had written
on the side of the building.

23:25.195 --> 23:26.738
And what did it say?

23:26.822 --> 23:28.573
"Honk if you hate Principal Clark."

23:29.241 --> 23:30.117
Oh.

23:30.700 --> 23:32.410
[Clark] Apparently everyone hates me,

23:32.494 --> 23:35.831
because it went to the point that
teachers couldn't conduct lessons.

23:37.249 --> 23:39.292
And how do you know that it was Kenny?

23:41.419 --> 23:43.463
I had hair before I met your son.

23:48.385 --> 23:50.595
Also, these were in his locker.

23:52.013 --> 23:52.889
[sighs]

23:54.182 --> 23:56.059
How's it going at home, Mrs. Boland?

23:57.811 --> 24:00.730
I mean, you know,
just like every other family.

24:01.314 --> 24:04.276
-[sighs] How's his binge eating?
-Much better.

24:04.359 --> 24:07.445
Well, I'm afraid to say
he's still having a hard time here.

24:07.529 --> 24:11.658
The kid constantly needs attention
and he certainly knows how to get it.

24:14.202 --> 24:15.120
[upbeat music playing]

24:15.203 --> 24:17.622
We encourage students
to get their message across,

24:17.706 --> 24:19.332
just not at the school's expense.

24:22.294 --> 24:23.420
Won't happen again.

24:25.881 --> 24:28.925
My opponent can blanket
the airwaves with her message,

24:29.009 --> 24:31.219
but I'd rather be
out here doing something.

24:31.303 --> 24:33.763
And what's your message, Mrs. Boland?

24:33.847 --> 24:36.099
It's time to clean up our streets.

24:41.646 --> 24:44.774
By removing their calling cards,
we're saying to these gangs,

24:44.858 --> 24:47.444
"You are not welcome in Ashfield."

24:56.494 --> 24:58.121
And whether I'm elected or not,

24:58.205 --> 25:00.790
I'll continue to fight
for this community's safety.

25:00.874 --> 25:02.250
[reporter] <i>How will you do that?</i>

25:02.334 --> 25:05.837
Well, as a mother, uh,
I know that some of the best ways

25:05.921 --> 25:08.048
to clean up a mess
is to get to it before it starts.

25:08.131 --> 25:09.424
What are you doing? Uh-uh.

25:09.507 --> 25:10.800
You gotta go big.

25:13.678 --> 25:16.223
<i>When you see a business</i>
<i>vandalized like this</i>

25:16.306 --> 25:19.267
<i>and assume that it's normal,</i>
<i>you know what happens?</i>

25:19.351 --> 25:20.560
<i>It becomes normal.</i>

25:20.644 --> 25:21.728
How'd I do?

25:23.271 --> 25:25.815
-Can I have my iPad?
-You're still grounded.

25:26.358 --> 25:27.275
Who's that guy?

25:28.610 --> 25:29.444
[Beth] Who?

25:30.570 --> 25:32.781
That… That guy. The guy…

25:32.864 --> 25:34.908
The guy with the coffees.

25:34.991 --> 25:36.117
[doorbell rings]

25:37.410 --> 25:40.622
-Uh, he's just some guy who works there.
-Are you sure?

25:40.705 --> 25:42.582
I mean, he made me a latte.

25:44.042 --> 25:45.418
Why? Do you know him?

25:46.002 --> 25:47.504
-I thought I did, yeah.
-[door opens]

25:48.171 --> 25:49.923
[Kenny] Hey, Mom, your friend's here.

25:52.092 --> 25:53.051
Hi, Denise.

25:55.428 --> 25:58.765
Does your family have
a special tie to the islands?

25:58.848 --> 26:01.351
There's so much Caribbean flare.

26:01.434 --> 26:03.645
Uh, Kenny, get the girls ready for dance.

26:06.606 --> 26:08.525
-Is that a hot tub?
-Yeah.

26:09.276 --> 26:11.361
We treat every day like it's a vacation.

26:11.444 --> 26:14.948
How do you have time to relax
with all the campaigning you're doing?

26:15.031 --> 26:16.825
How can I help you, Denise?

26:16.908 --> 26:18.618
I came to congratulate you.

26:19.786 --> 26:20.662
I haven't won yet.

26:20.745 --> 26:24.708
Chief Gorski has been raving
about your neighborhood safety plan.

26:25.667 --> 26:29.212
-Oh, he's been really helpful.
-I would love for you to get it going.

26:30.046 --> 26:31.006
That's the plan.

26:32.257 --> 26:33.425
After I'm elected.

26:34.009 --> 26:35.093
I don't understand.

26:35.677 --> 26:37.137
I'm offering you a job.

26:38.596 --> 26:39.973
Why would I do that?

26:40.056 --> 26:41.725
Because he also mentioned

26:41.808 --> 26:44.728
the legal trouble
that your husband's been having.

26:45.520 --> 26:47.230
He hasn't been convicted of anything.

26:47.314 --> 26:50.900
But does it really matter
when that's your entire platform?

26:50.984 --> 26:53.278
[footsteps approaching]

26:53.361 --> 26:54.821
Can we order a pizza?

26:54.904 --> 26:56.614
Uh, one… one minute.

26:57.866 --> 27:00.910
Anyway… You're busy. Think about it.

27:02.746 --> 27:03.621
Oh.

27:05.457 --> 27:06.374
<i>Mahalo.</i>

27:15.383 --> 27:17.761
-Oh! [exhales]
-[knocking at door]

27:17.844 --> 27:19.554
Do not disturb is on!

27:22.807 --> 27:23.892
[knocking continues]

27:23.975 --> 27:25.352
You're disturbing!

27:27.145 --> 27:28.605
[knocking continues]

27:28.688 --> 27:31.524
Oh, my God! [sighs]

27:34.736 --> 27:36.071
What do you want?

27:38.031 --> 27:39.532
-A do-over.
-[Phoebe sighs]

27:40.867 --> 27:41.868
I'm good.

27:42.577 --> 27:44.371
There's nothing to steal
from you this time.

27:47.916 --> 27:49.000
One drink.

27:53.213 --> 27:54.589
I need that plate back.

27:56.674 --> 27:57.592
[glass clinks]

27:58.760 --> 27:59.803
What for?

27:59.886 --> 28:02.305
So I can replace what I took from you.

28:02.931 --> 28:04.140
What good would that do?

28:04.224 --> 28:07.394
You can say you misplaced it
and make everything right again.

28:07.477 --> 28:09.771
Too late. Wouldn't make us right.

28:10.355 --> 28:12.148
He made me do it. Okay?

28:12.232 --> 28:14.526
-You should've told me.
-I had to protect my family.

28:14.609 --> 28:16.152
Maybe I could've helped.

28:16.945 --> 28:19.572
I'm supposed to trust
the person who busted me?

28:19.656 --> 28:20.657
-Yeah.
-How?

28:20.740 --> 28:21.950
I trusted you.

28:24.327 --> 28:26.413
-Because we're supposed to be friends?
-I don't know.

28:26.496 --> 28:28.748
-How would that even work?
-I don't know.

28:28.832 --> 28:32.419
So we just put aside that I do what I do
and you do what you do,

28:32.502 --> 28:36.464
and we just meet up
for a girl's trip in Cabo every year?

28:41.594 --> 28:42.429
[sighs]

28:49.894 --> 28:51.479
The plate's back in DC.

28:53.898 --> 28:54.816
Can you get it?

28:55.942 --> 28:57.193
I just wanna get him.

29:00.780 --> 29:01.656
I can't run.

29:01.740 --> 29:02.782
Why?

29:03.533 --> 29:05.994
Because she's gonna use Dean against me.

29:06.077 --> 29:07.162
Who leaked it?

29:07.245 --> 29:11.124
Her daughter takes tap
with the chief's kid. It's a mom thing.

29:13.877 --> 29:16.755
-I have to bring back something.
-Well, I have to drop out.

29:16.838 --> 29:18.548
And I'd rather it not be you.

29:18.631 --> 29:20.884
So what am I supposed to do here?

29:21.885 --> 29:23.762
Do to her what you did to me.

29:26.973 --> 29:28.266
[door opens]

29:28.349 --> 29:29.768
[Dave sighs]

29:29.851 --> 29:35.023
What they call a gym is actually
a closet with a NordicTrack from 1992.

29:35.106 --> 29:38.610
I'd be better off up here
curling bags of my own urine.

29:38.693 --> 29:39.736
Please don't.

29:43.573 --> 29:44.866
Everything cool?

29:49.996 --> 29:50.914
Yep.

29:56.461 --> 29:58.546
I'm going to take a shower.

30:02.509 --> 30:03.635
[Ben chuckling]

30:03.718 --> 30:07.138
Obviously. How come everything
makes me think of Harry Styles?

30:07.222 --> 30:08.556
-I mean…
-[chuckles]

30:08.640 --> 30:10.558
[Nancy laughing]

30:11.184 --> 30:13.311
I thought he broke up with her.

30:14.312 --> 30:15.438
Could be a rebound.

30:18.024 --> 30:20.318
Do you want me to, uh, turn the oven on?

30:20.401 --> 30:22.111
[Kevin and Nancy laughing]

30:24.030 --> 30:25.073
What's wrong?

30:25.990 --> 30:27.951
Oh, nothing, they just…

30:28.034 --> 30:29.452
-forgot the garlic knots.
-Mmm.

30:30.203 --> 30:31.412
I'll warm it up.

30:32.956 --> 30:34.415
[Nancy and Kevin sigh]

30:37.627 --> 30:38.670
[oven beeps]

30:40.213 --> 30:41.756
There's pizza…

30:41.840 --> 30:44.843
-if you wanna come up for air.
-[Kevin] Cool. Come check us out.

30:45.885 --> 30:48.137
That will not be necessary. Thank you.

30:48.221 --> 30:49.222
[Nancy] Come here.

30:56.729 --> 30:58.731
She needed someone to do the back.

30:59.399 --> 31:01.484
[scoffs] You could have called.

31:01.568 --> 31:03.611
They shut my phone off.

31:04.320 --> 31:05.947
You can't pay your phone bill?

31:06.030 --> 31:08.199
Autopay's connected
to an overdrawn account.

31:08.283 --> 31:10.326
It's like a whole thing. [chuckles]

31:12.287 --> 31:13.955
Well, I hope you know what you're doing.

31:14.038 --> 31:16.124
He trained at Vidal Sassoon.

31:16.207 --> 31:18.668
Ah, no. Uh, Vito Sassin.

31:18.751 --> 31:20.003
Who's that?

31:20.628 --> 31:23.673
-Owns the dog grooming place on Trumbull.
-Oh, my God.

31:23.756 --> 31:26.342
You know what?
I'm gonna take over. Go grab a slice, huh?

31:29.304 --> 31:30.388
[Kevin] All right.

31:30.930 --> 31:32.932
-[Annie] Thank you.
-[Kevin] Excuse me.

31:35.435 --> 31:36.436
How is it?

31:37.103 --> 31:38.021
Let me see.

31:39.522 --> 31:41.065
-Hmm.
-Oh, no.

31:42.442 --> 31:44.652
[scoffs] I can't believe I'm saying this,

31:44.736 --> 31:47.488
but he actually got all your roots.

31:48.197 --> 31:49.365
Really?

31:49.449 --> 31:52.869
Yeah, and I feel like he somehow
may have given you highlights.

31:52.952 --> 31:54.787
-Oh, okay.
-[Annie snickers]

31:54.871 --> 31:57.790
-Maybe I should start going to Vito.
-[both laugh]

31:58.750 --> 32:01.836
Wow. This is, like, kind of amazing.

32:03.338 --> 32:05.465
-So is he.
-[scoffs]

32:05.548 --> 32:07.508
You know,
he taught me how to get double points.

32:07.592 --> 32:11.596
And not just at CVS,
but Walgreens, Rite Aid, Kroger's.

32:11.679 --> 32:13.222
They all apparently do it.

32:13.306 --> 32:15.350
Yeah, his whole life is a hack.

32:16.017 --> 32:18.436
I shouldn't have been so judgy about him.

32:19.020 --> 32:20.521
It's hard not to be.

32:20.605 --> 32:22.023
[Nancy] He's a really good guy.

32:22.607 --> 32:23.483
[chuckling] Yeah.

32:23.566 --> 32:26.319
-There aren't a lot of them out there.
-[Annie] Ugh, I know.

32:27.028 --> 32:28.529
I'm really happy for you.

32:30.490 --> 32:32.784
Oh, uh… No, we're not…

32:33.534 --> 32:34.827
It's not like that.

32:35.912 --> 32:37.163
Oh.

32:43.920 --> 32:44.837
Well, why not?

32:48.591 --> 32:49.884
[Beth] <i>It's so clean.</i>

32:49.968 --> 32:52.804
Well, my kids know
it's the only way to get their allowance.

32:52.887 --> 32:55.556
[chuckles] I can hardly get mine
to brush their teeth.

32:55.640 --> 32:58.476
Oh, well, you know,
you just have to give them structure.

32:59.143 --> 33:02.480
Or maybe you're very good
at convincing people to do things.

33:02.563 --> 33:03.439
[chuckles]

33:03.523 --> 33:05.274
-Coffee?
-Yes, please.

33:05.358 --> 33:08.361
If it makes you feel better,
I think we'll be a great team.

33:08.444 --> 33:09.529
Oh, so do I.

33:09.612 --> 33:11.906
-Wonderful.
-I couldn't win without you.

33:13.116 --> 33:15.284
Wait… I'm sorry?

33:17.120 --> 33:19.414
I'm gonna need all those Jesus lovers.

33:23.668 --> 33:25.628
Is that a Portmeirion butter dish?

33:26.421 --> 33:28.089
It was an anniversary gift.

33:29.215 --> 33:30.675
Do you have the whole set?

33:33.720 --> 33:34.971
He can have it.

33:35.722 --> 33:37.682
-Do you collect Portmeirion?
-Nah.

33:41.394 --> 33:43.146
[screaming]

33:45.106 --> 33:46.733
What is he doing?

33:48.151 --> 33:50.278
He's making it look like a home invasion.

33:51.362 --> 33:53.781
Wait, no. I… I… I have a family.

33:55.742 --> 33:56.659
So do I.

33:57.618 --> 33:59.871
Wait, please. Please don't do this.

33:59.954 --> 34:02.248
Let's hurry,
I'm picking Danny up from band.

34:04.292 --> 34:05.126
[gasps]

34:07.879 --> 34:09.422
I'll do whatever you want.

34:10.965 --> 34:12.216
I'll leave him out of it.

34:14.886 --> 34:16.929
Does your daughter skate, too?

34:18.056 --> 34:19.724
Do you like figure skating?

34:19.807 --> 34:21.059
I love the Ice Capades.

34:21.768 --> 34:26.731
He will be at every practice,
every show, everywhere.

34:30.610 --> 34:32.278
I won't tell anyone.

34:35.907 --> 34:37.742
Oh, hey.

34:37.825 --> 34:39.243
Thank you for your support.

34:40.495 --> 34:41.454
[shudders]

34:41.537 --> 34:43.122
[crying]

34:48.544 --> 34:49.462
[Tina] Come over here.

34:50.046 --> 34:52.799
-[Vance] I got it.
-[Tina] No, I need you to see. Come here.

34:53.466 --> 34:54.467
[Vance sighs]

34:57.428 --> 34:59.138
-Yeah.
-What is that?

34:59.972 --> 35:03.726
-[sighs] It's not the end of the world.
-A Big Mac is people food.

35:04.310 --> 35:06.354
-I'm sorry. Okay?
-How does that help me?

35:06.437 --> 35:07.355
[sighs]

35:09.899 --> 35:11.400
[sighs] What do you want, Tina?

35:11.484 --> 35:13.111
I want <i>you</i> to wake up at midnight

35:13.194 --> 35:15.780
when Licorice has the squirts
all over our bedroom.

35:15.863 --> 35:16.697
Fine.

35:17.240 --> 35:18.491
Hey, we're not done here.

35:19.033 --> 35:20.618
[Vance] He barely ate any of it.

35:21.244 --> 35:23.079
[Tina] I just need you
to answer something.

35:23.162 --> 35:24.038
[Vance sighs]

35:25.081 --> 35:25.915
What's that?

35:26.791 --> 35:29.877
[Tina] How do you make it through your day
being such a moron?

35:30.461 --> 35:32.171
Can we talk about this later?

35:32.672 --> 35:34.132
Just think about my question.

35:36.050 --> 35:37.176
[Vance scoffs]

35:37.760 --> 35:39.053
Hey, where were we? Um…

35:39.137 --> 35:43.182
Oh, right, so, corporate wants us
to do a promo with the fruit acid peel.

35:46.227 --> 35:47.353
Can I ask you something?

35:47.436 --> 35:50.731
Oh, she's on an elephant dose
of IVF crap. Ignore her.

35:50.815 --> 35:53.234
Hey, did you really
give that stuff to the DA?

35:54.861 --> 35:56.195
Yeah. Why?

35:57.488 --> 35:59.991
-I saw him yesterday.
-Where?

36:02.034 --> 36:02.869
Starbucks.

36:04.078 --> 36:04.996
Nice.

36:07.081 --> 36:08.124
He works there.

36:10.376 --> 36:12.128
He works <i>out</i> of a lot of places.

36:12.795 --> 36:15.548
Hmm, no, he was serving the coffee.

36:16.299 --> 36:18.134
Middle-aged bald dad?

36:18.217 --> 36:19.719
[Dean] Yeah, with a green apron.

36:21.012 --> 36:25.141
-That could have been anybody.
-But the name tag said Darryl.

36:27.268 --> 36:28.269
[sighs]

36:29.937 --> 36:31.355
We didn't have a choice.

36:36.485 --> 36:38.154
I made the name tag part up.

36:40.239 --> 36:43.868
-We're gonna send it to the real DA.
-What are you guys waiting for?

36:45.328 --> 36:46.287
Ask your friend.

36:47.580 --> 36:48.414
Stan?

36:48.497 --> 36:50.833
You're not the only one in a tight spot.

36:53.586 --> 36:55.671
[Tina] Jesus! It's all over the comforter!

36:58.799 --> 36:59.634
Coming!

37:00.718 --> 37:03.638
-[Tina] Bring the carpet cleaner!
-Excuse me.

37:12.480 --> 37:14.106
[Stan] You in my business again?

37:14.190 --> 37:15.691
The hell is bee venom?

37:15.775 --> 37:18.653
Oh, don't tell me. I know this one.

37:18.736 --> 37:22.823
Increases blood flow to the area,
bringing fresh oxygen and nutrients,

37:22.907 --> 37:26.118
also stimulates the production
of collagen and elastin.

37:27.078 --> 37:30.122
Hmm. Yeah, I meant
all of this. What is this?

37:30.206 --> 37:32.667
Well, it's my business, literally.

37:33.292 --> 37:34.126
Bee venom?

37:34.961 --> 37:38.422
No, not just that.
This has got, uh, vitamin-C balm.

37:38.965 --> 37:43.636
You got your energizing face wash.
And you got your serum concentrate.

37:45.471 --> 37:46.389
So, lotions.

37:48.099 --> 37:52.561
Look, babe, I'm just trying
to keep us out of trouble, okay?

37:53.187 --> 37:54.897
But I have the club now.

37:54.981 --> 37:58.234
-Club's trouble.
-The club pays the bills.

37:58.317 --> 38:00.152
Until more trouble comes knocking.

38:01.779 --> 38:03.239
Who is this trouble?

38:04.073 --> 38:05.116
I don't know.

38:05.199 --> 38:07.576
But it always seems to find you ladies.

38:12.999 --> 38:14.458
Oh, is this like the Scouts?

38:14.542 --> 38:16.502
Where I gotta make people buy it at work?

38:16.585 --> 38:18.879
No, I hit up my own network.

38:20.965 --> 38:24.093
-How deep are you in this?
-Oh, just a year's worth.

38:25.094 --> 38:27.471
-[scoffs] Jesus.
-What?

38:28.139 --> 38:32.018
[scoffs] Just so you know,
none of these are for Black people.

38:34.270 --> 38:35.980
These <i>are</i> for Black people.

38:40.151 --> 38:41.402

Love what you've done with the place.

Not all of it.

So, your tag is really coming along.

40:34.765 --> 40:37.017
I've got a really good campaign team.

40:39.353 --> 40:41.147
I told you you didn't need him.
