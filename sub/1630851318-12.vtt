WEBVTT

00:44.000 --> 00:46.220
Oh, my God!
Shaun!

00:48.439 --> 00:50.572
You're masturbating.

00:50.746 --> 00:52.661
I thought you left.

00:52.835 --> 00:55.316
I could catch the next bus if
you would like to have sex now.

00:55.490 --> 00:56.621
No... No, thank you.

00:58.971 --> 01:02.801
But you were...

01:02.975 --> 01:05.587
I'm good, and it's late.

01:08.285 --> 01:09.373
Okay.

01:15.727 --> 01:17.294
Oh, my God.

01:17.468 --> 01:21.820
Mariel Torres, 31, fever,
BP 124 over 83.

01:21.994 --> 01:24.171
Fainted coming
off a plane at SFO.

01:24.345 --> 01:25.737
Fiance said she's had
a persistent cough,

01:25.911 --> 01:27.174
pain in her chest
and abdomen.

01:27.348 --> 01:28.175
How long has she had
these symptoms?

01:28.349 --> 01:29.524
Months, on and off.

01:29.698 --> 01:31.569
I kept telling her
to go to a doctor.

01:31.743 --> 01:34.355
Soft and non-tender, no distention
or guarding present.

01:34.529 --> 01:36.531
Uh...Isaac, what's...
what's happening?

01:36.705 --> 01:38.141
Ms. Torres, I'm Dr. Lim.

01:38.315 --> 01:39.882
You're at
St. Bonaventure Hospital.

01:40.056 --> 01:41.231
You collapsed
at the airport.

01:41.405 --> 01:43.451
I'm... I'm not covered.
My insurance lapsed.

01:45.017 --> 01:46.193
We can fast-track
your access

01:46.367 --> 01:47.803
to St. Bonaventure's
uninsured program.

01:47.977 --> 01:49.326
Any recent stressors?

01:49.500 --> 01:50.806
I've been traveling a lot
for work.

01:50.980 --> 01:52.155
Deep breath, please.

01:53.809 --> 01:55.854
She's a photographer.

01:56.028 --> 01:58.074
She documents immigrant
communities across California.

02:00.120 --> 02:00.685
I tagged along
this last trip.

02:01.860 --> 02:02.731
He keeps me sane.

02:04.646 --> 02:06.561
Rales and rhonchi, decreased
breath sounds bilaterally.

02:06.735 --> 02:07.692
We need a chest X-ray.

02:09.216 --> 02:10.304
Hey.

02:12.393 --> 02:13.263
We got this.

02:15.091 --> 02:16.223
You and me.

02:20.575 --> 02:22.664
What do you do for work?

02:22.838 --> 02:25.057
Uh, I am one
of the research professors

02:25.232 --> 02:27.756
of the Jane Austen project
at Stanford.

02:27.930 --> 02:30.150
I imagine you sit a lot?

02:30.324 --> 02:33.065
Well, it would be unethical
to read a first edition

02:33.240 --> 02:34.415
of Sense and Sensibility
standing up.

02:36.112 --> 02:37.722
That explains why you're
in so much pain.

02:37.896 --> 02:39.115
You have
severe hemorrhoids.

02:41.639 --> 02:43.685
Well... Can you give me
a salve or something?

02:43.859 --> 02:46.601
This is...beyond salve.

02:49.995 --> 02:51.432
They seem like
a cool couple.

02:51.606 --> 02:53.216
They seem fine.

02:53.390 --> 02:54.783
Torres imaging
come through yet?

02:54.957 --> 02:55.914
Not yet.

02:56.088 --> 02:59.091
Supportive,
fun, loving,

02:59.266 --> 03:01.442
but not in a gross,
performative way.

03:01.616 --> 03:03.313
You picked up a lot
in two minutes.

03:03.487 --> 03:04.967
Sounds like someone
wants a boyfriend.

03:05.141 --> 03:07.839
I have been considering
venturing out of Hookuptown

03:08.013 --> 03:09.798
for something more serious,

03:09.972 --> 03:12.453
which requires finding
someone to get serious about.

03:12.627 --> 03:13.715
That does tend to be
the hard part.

03:13.889 --> 03:15.499
Well, that's why I've decided
to raise the bar,

03:15.673 --> 03:19.590
only date guys
that check all the boxes.

03:19.764 --> 03:21.418
So, your plan is to be more
open by being more closed?

03:22.680 --> 03:24.291
The images are in.

03:24.465 --> 03:26.989
I want to be
more intentional about it,

03:27.163 --> 03:30.645
find someone who gets me,
but also challenges me.

03:30.819 --> 03:31.950
Instead of getting diverted

03:32.124 --> 03:34.039
by whoever has
the hottest profile pic.

03:34.214 --> 03:35.693
Two nodules
in the left lung,

03:35.867 --> 03:37.042
one in the upper lobe,
one lower.

03:40.611 --> 03:41.308
That doesn't look like
pneumonia.

03:42.309 --> 03:43.484
That looks like cancer.

04:01.589 --> 04:02.242
Hi.

04:09.205 --> 04:10.554
So, about this morning,

04:10.728 --> 04:13.078
when you came home
and caught me, you know...

04:15.907 --> 04:18.432
Boosting my own morale...

04:21.086 --> 04:24.786
I used to boost my own morale
a lot before we got together.

04:24.960 --> 04:26.309
But I don't anymore

04:26.483 --> 04:27.919
because we usually have
very satisfying sex.

04:28.093 --> 04:29.356
Yes, we do.

04:29.530 --> 04:30.922
Absolutely, we do.

04:31.096 --> 04:32.881
Did you need a boost

04:33.055 --> 04:34.143
because we haven't had sex
in nine days?

04:35.971 --> 04:37.799
I didn't know
we were counting.

04:37.973 --> 04:39.540
Our average
is every 2.3 days.

04:42.064 --> 04:44.980
It has been
a stressful few months.

04:45.154 --> 04:48.331
If you wanted
a morale boost,

04:48.505 --> 04:50.072
why didn't you want me
to do it for you?

04:50.246 --> 04:52.509
No, it's... it's not that.

04:52.683 --> 04:54.642
I-I just... I don't know.

04:54.816 --> 04:57.253
I woke up
and had a few minutes

04:57.427 --> 04:58.863
and wanted
to take the edge off.

05:01.866 --> 05:04.565
Is it...the same
as when we're together?

05:04.739 --> 05:06.044
No.

05:06.218 --> 05:08.395
It's...different.

05:08.569 --> 05:10.658
It's definitely not as good,

05:10.832 --> 05:13.051
but it is...faster.

05:13.225 --> 05:14.575
Oh, I can go faster.

05:14.749 --> 05:16.968
No, Shaun.

05:17.142 --> 05:19.101
Boosting my own morale

05:19.275 --> 05:20.711
is not a substitute

05:20.885 --> 05:23.584
for being with you, ever.

05:23.758 --> 05:25.586
And I did try
to get things going

05:25.760 --> 05:26.848
a couple times
last week,

05:27.022 --> 05:28.937
but you were busy.

05:29.111 --> 05:31.592
You didn't ring
the cowbell.

05:31.766 --> 05:33.333
It wasn't
cowbell worthy.

05:33.507 --> 05:35.204
We agreed if we were off course,
we'd ring the cowbell.

05:35.378 --> 05:36.901
We are not off course.

05:37.075 --> 05:38.816
We're having a dry spell,
and it will blow over.

05:42.080 --> 05:43.517
That is a lot
of weather terms.

05:44.996 --> 05:46.171
I'm not sure they apply.

05:48.304 --> 05:49.392
Yeah.

05:54.310 --> 05:58.183
Anorectal ailments are one of the
oldest recorded medical conditions.

05:58.358 --> 05:59.968
One early remedy was to
burn them off with hot coals.

06:02.405 --> 06:03.841
We can remove
yours surgically,

06:04.015 --> 06:05.800
but we need to
do it right away.

06:05.974 --> 06:07.889
Isn't there some way we could
schedule it for next week?

06:08.063 --> 06:10.413
Your hemorrhoids
have already ruptured.

06:10.587 --> 06:12.415
You're at risk
of serious complications.

06:12.589 --> 06:14.025
Oh.

06:14.199 --> 06:16.114
The surgery is now routine
and effective.

06:16.288 --> 06:17.464
No hot coals.

06:17.638 --> 06:19.335
But the recovery
can be quite painful.

06:19.509 --> 06:21.076
You'll need a special diet
and sitz baths.

06:21.250 --> 06:23.208
No exercise or exertion,
including sex,

06:23.383 --> 06:24.601
for six to eight weeks
post-op.

06:24.775 --> 06:26.081
No sex? Why?

06:26.255 --> 06:28.126
The wounds need time
to heal.

06:28.300 --> 06:29.954
We can get you on the schedule
for later today.

06:32.348 --> 06:34.437
The X-rays show two nodules
in your left lung,

06:34.611 --> 06:35.264
possibly cancerous.

06:37.440 --> 06:38.615
We'll know more
after the biopsy.

06:38.789 --> 06:39.660
It's a simple procedure.

06:39.834 --> 06:41.662
Um, the... the biopsy...

06:41.836 --> 06:44.186
Is covered
under the uninsured program?

06:44.360 --> 06:46.057
It all is.

06:46.231 --> 06:48.277
And we'll run a few labs
and get you started on fluids.

06:48.451 --> 06:49.626
Is this arm okay for the IV?

06:49.800 --> 06:51.846
Mm-hmm.

06:52.020 --> 06:53.456
Listen, Mari, I was on the
phone with your insurance.

06:53.630 --> 06:54.979
What? W-Why?

06:55.153 --> 06:56.938
To save you the hassle.

06:57.112 --> 06:58.766
Sorry,
I need you to hold still.Oh. Sorry.

06:58.940 --> 07:01.246
You... You shouldn't
have called them.

07:01.421 --> 07:03.248
Why not? We need
to get this sorted out.

07:05.381 --> 07:08.210
Mari, whatever is going on,

07:09.777 --> 07:10.691
you can tell me.

07:16.610 --> 07:17.785
Um...

07:20.178 --> 07:21.745
My insurance didn't lapse.

07:21.919 --> 07:24.008
I, uh...I lost it.

07:26.402 --> 07:27.011
Because, um...

07:30.362 --> 07:31.581
I'm undocumented.

07:41.330 --> 07:42.026
Brenna?

07:42.984 --> 07:44.986
W-Where is our patient?

07:45.160 --> 07:46.553
She's not in the bathroom,

07:46.727 --> 07:49.077
and her clothes and personal
belongings are all gone.

07:49.251 --> 07:50.557
Code green.
We have a runner.

07:57.738 --> 08:00.741
I checked the whole
second floor. No Brenna.

08:00.915 --> 08:03.570
She's not in the cafeteria
or the lobby or the gift shop.

08:03.744 --> 08:05.223
We should check
all the exits.

08:05.397 --> 08:07.051
Lea and I haven't had sex
for nine days.

08:10.533 --> 08:12.970
Lenore,
the gift-shop cashier,

08:13.144 --> 08:15.277
she recommended
light bondage.

08:15.451 --> 08:17.540
Dr. Park suggested
a romantic bubble bath,

08:17.714 --> 08:19.281
but Lea and I don't agree
on water temperature.

08:20.456 --> 08:21.849
You both are busy.

08:22.980 --> 08:24.460
Have you tried
scheduling it?

08:25.374 --> 08:26.810
Reliability is sexy.

08:31.162 --> 08:32.554
I think we found her.

08:42.916 --> 08:44.657
All right,
time for your biopsy.

08:44.831 --> 08:46.572
I'll have her back
in about an hour or so.

08:48.618 --> 08:50.402
I should drop the bags off
at the apartment.

08:50.576 --> 08:52.883
Isaac, can we please
talk about this

08:53.057 --> 08:53.623
before I go
into my procedure?

08:55.015 --> 08:57.061
We've been together
two years.

08:57.235 --> 08:58.323
I was gonna tell you.

08:58.497 --> 08:59.150
When?

09:00.281 --> 09:01.326
The wedding?

09:05.069 --> 09:07.550
I promised myself that if
marriage were ever on the table

09:07.724 --> 09:09.552
for real,
that I'd tell you,

09:09.726 --> 09:11.902
but when you proposed,

09:12.076 --> 09:14.252
my DACA renewal
had just been rejected.

09:14.426 --> 09:17.124
And it really
freaked me out.

09:21.433 --> 09:22.129
It was, uh...

09:24.349 --> 09:27.134
It was all because of a stupid
marijuana DUI on my record.

09:29.963 --> 09:31.008
Another thing
you've been hiding.

09:32.705 --> 09:34.402
It was years ago.

09:34.577 --> 09:37.449
Cops pulled me over
for a tail light.

09:37.623 --> 09:40.321
They searched
and they found edibles,

09:40.495 --> 09:42.410
and they arrested me
for driving high,

09:42.585 --> 09:43.194
which I wasn't.

09:50.593 --> 09:52.072
Okay, let's get her
some humidified oxygen.

09:55.989 --> 09:58.339
I was...

09:58.513 --> 10:00.037
I was trying
to get it expunged.

10:00.211 --> 10:01.429
Breathe into this.

10:07.348 --> 10:08.654
I'm gonna go.

10:28.282 --> 10:28.718
I can get rid of that
for you.

10:33.113 --> 10:34.201
There's blood in her sputum.

10:37.465 --> 10:40.730
You're bleeding
from your lungs and airway.

10:40.904 --> 10:42.296
Let's get to the O.R.,
stat.

10:46.126 --> 10:48.781
I'm sorry I ran.
I know I need surgery.

10:48.955 --> 10:50.043
You're scared.
I understand.

10:50.217 --> 10:53.307
No, it's not just that.
I have this date

10:53.481 --> 10:55.353
that I've been waiting
a really long time for.

10:55.527 --> 10:57.224
And a rain check
poses a problem?

11:00.358 --> 11:01.881
I am...

11:03.753 --> 11:04.536
A virgin.

11:06.364 --> 11:08.192
I am 45 years old
and I have never had sex.

11:10.281 --> 11:11.499
Because of your religion?

11:11.674 --> 11:13.240
Honestly, I don't know.

11:16.156 --> 11:17.201
I mean,
freshman year in college,

11:17.375 --> 11:19.551
I-I made
this really detailed list

11:19.725 --> 11:20.944
of what I wanted
in a boyfriend,

11:21.118 --> 11:23.294
and then I fell madly in love
with my work.

11:23.468 --> 11:24.425
For a while, I thought
I wasn't having sex

11:24.599 --> 11:27.124
because I was obsessed
with Jane Austen.

11:27.298 --> 11:30.780
It's commonly believed that
she was a virgin when she died.

11:30.954 --> 11:33.696
She was obsessed
with her work, too.

11:33.870 --> 11:35.785
I n--
I never stopped looking.

11:37.830 --> 11:39.745
But every year
that I waited,

11:39.919 --> 11:41.704
it just got harder
to imagine telling someone

11:41.878 --> 11:43.923
I'd met a couple times
over coffee or drinks

11:44.097 --> 11:46.534
that I...
had never had sex.

11:48.406 --> 11:49.102
I just...

11:51.583 --> 11:53.541
I just felt so ashamed.

11:53.716 --> 11:55.456
You have nothing
to be ashamed of.

11:55.630 --> 11:58.372
Well, okay.

12:01.288 --> 12:01.941
Tell me about this date.

12:02.986 --> 12:03.943
Really?

12:04.117 --> 12:04.770
Mm-hmm.

12:06.119 --> 12:07.294
Okay. Um...

12:08.687 --> 12:09.601
His name is Viktor.

12:11.211 --> 12:13.213
He's an old friend
from college.

12:13.387 --> 12:14.301
Glaciologist.

12:14.475 --> 12:16.042
Oh.Yeah.

12:16.216 --> 12:19.611
And he's usually in Antarctica
or the Arctic Circle,

12:19.785 --> 12:24.442
but he's visiting San Jose
for two days.

12:25.748 --> 12:28.098
I was so scared to ask.

12:28.272 --> 12:29.403
I thought
he would laugh at me.

12:31.971 --> 12:35.801
But he just said
he would be honored.

12:38.630 --> 12:39.849
You've waited a long time.

12:40.023 --> 12:40.719
I have.

12:43.635 --> 12:44.636
And if I don't do it now,

12:45.724 --> 12:47.334
then w-what if I never...

12:49.467 --> 12:50.773
I'm not having the surgery
until I have sex with Viktor.

12:56.430 --> 12:58.345
Lea and I haven't had sex
in nine days.

13:01.740 --> 13:02.436
Okay.

13:04.090 --> 13:05.918
Um...
nine days isn't a thing.

13:06.092 --> 13:08.878
It is something.

13:09.052 --> 13:12.098
You said you and Debbie
had a very good sex life.

13:12.272 --> 13:13.708
I would like to know
all your secrets.

13:14.492 --> 13:15.188
I said that?

13:18.061 --> 13:19.889
Okay. Okay.
Okay. Okay.

13:22.195 --> 13:23.370
Okay. Uh...

13:25.198 --> 13:27.548
I got to test drive
a Testarossa once,

13:27.722 --> 13:28.811
a Ferrari, an '86.

13:28.985 --> 13:30.813
Oh, my God.
Beautiful car.

13:30.987 --> 13:33.424
Got my friend to get us
a track at Thunderhill.

13:33.598 --> 13:35.078
I get into the car...

13:35.252 --> 13:37.558
Leather interior,
stunning detail.

13:37.732 --> 13:39.560
I mean,
this car is ready.

13:39.734 --> 13:42.389
And I kick it into gear,
and it stalls.

13:42.563 --> 13:44.478
I kick it into gear again,
and it stalls again.

13:44.652 --> 13:45.828
It's jerking back and forth.

13:46.002 --> 13:48.743
I'm destroying
this $200,000 machine.

13:48.918 --> 13:52.225
Why? Because the pedals
are too close together.

13:52.399 --> 13:54.184
I'm...
I'm stepping on the brake

13:54.358 --> 13:55.402
and the accelerator
at the same time.

13:57.100 --> 14:00.059
Are you saying
that a Ferrari

14:00.233 --> 14:02.322
will not cure my dry spell
with Lea?

14:02.496 --> 14:04.063
No.

14:04.237 --> 14:06.936
I'm trying to explain
this sex book

14:07.110 --> 14:10.417
that Debbie gave me
called Come As You Are.

14:10.591 --> 14:11.941
See, uh,
according to the book,

14:12.115 --> 14:14.595
people think of it
as a sex drive, you know,

14:14.769 --> 14:16.119
and that's too simple.

14:16.293 --> 14:18.773
There's also a brake
and an accelerator.

14:18.948 --> 14:21.428
Dr. Glassman? The new
nursing schedule is a mess.

14:21.602 --> 14:22.734
Hawks and I have some ideas
to make it better,

14:22.908 --> 14:23.996
if you have time today?Okay, I think...

14:24.170 --> 14:26.172
I think
Dr. Andrews is your guy.

14:26.346 --> 14:28.827
If I could get time
on his calendar, I'd ask him.

14:29.001 --> 14:31.090
Fine. Um, if he doesn't get back to you
in a week, then come back to me.

14:33.832 --> 14:34.789
Uh...

14:36.530 --> 14:40.447
Accelerating is
all the things that rev...

14:42.319 --> 14:43.320
...the engine.

14:43.494 --> 14:44.712
Oh.

14:44.887 --> 14:45.975
All right. Listening,

14:47.977 --> 14:49.021
chocolates,

14:50.501 --> 14:52.416
listening a lot.

14:52.590 --> 14:54.287
And braking is everything

14:54.461 --> 14:56.246
that... that gets
in the way of good...

14:57.073 --> 14:58.335
You know, sex.

14:59.727 --> 15:01.381
Stress and work
and insecurities

15:01.555 --> 15:04.167
and jealousy and stress.
Yes?

15:04.341 --> 15:08.301
Sorry to interrupt, but we are having major
crackage problems with the BioGlass pipettes.

15:08.475 --> 15:10.216
Isn't that
a President thing?

15:10.390 --> 15:14.307
I have had issues talking to him
after the last couple months.

15:14.481 --> 15:15.961
I'll send you an e-mail,
fill you in on all the issues.

15:16.135 --> 15:16.788
I look forward to that.

15:20.966 --> 15:22.794
Car.

15:22.968 --> 15:24.970
Do you do
regular maintenance?

15:25.144 --> 15:27.799
Are you, you know, talking
and communicating and...

15:27.973 --> 15:30.715
Oh, talking, texting.

15:30.889 --> 15:32.717
But mostly about work.

15:32.891 --> 15:34.327
Okay.

15:34.501 --> 15:37.504
So, maybe
a little bit less braking,

15:37.678 --> 15:39.419
a little bit
more accelerating.

15:39.593 --> 15:41.030
You know,
when you get home tonight,

15:41.204 --> 15:42.248
leave your work
at the door.

15:42.422 --> 15:43.597
Go inside,
put on some music,

15:43.771 --> 15:44.947
light some candles,
not too many.

15:45.121 --> 15:46.165
You don't want to make
an announcement.

15:46.339 --> 15:47.036
How many?

15:48.341 --> 15:49.038
Nine.

15:50.691 --> 15:51.127
And no weather channel.

15:56.132 --> 15:57.046
Okay.

15:57.220 --> 15:59.265
I...will try.

15:59.439 --> 16:00.397
I have to get back
to work.

16:02.138 --> 16:03.313
Okay.

16:05.402 --> 16:06.185
Got a minute?

16:08.840 --> 16:09.623
There's the bleeder.

16:09.797 --> 16:11.321
Cauterizing.

16:11.495 --> 16:13.584
This nodule's
caused a lot of damage.

16:13.758 --> 16:15.847
It's too bad she didn't feel
safe coming to a hospital.

16:16.021 --> 16:18.632
Mm. One of my aunts
was undocumented.

16:18.806 --> 16:19.807
She never let
her guard down.

16:19.982 --> 16:21.679
With anyone.

16:21.853 --> 16:23.855
Inserting mini-forceps
into the tract.

16:24.029 --> 16:26.510
But hiding it
from your fiance?

16:26.684 --> 16:28.860
Doesn't exactly bode well.

16:29.034 --> 16:31.341
Ah, you're really ready to judge
this relationship, aren't you?

16:31.515 --> 16:33.125
First, they're "supportive,
fun, and loving,"

16:33.299 --> 16:36.563
now it's built on betrayal.
There's the nodule.

16:36.737 --> 16:38.652
Advance a little further.
Then we can take the sample.

16:38.826 --> 16:41.090
Which suggests that you
might be lacking experience

16:41.264 --> 16:42.482
with long-term
relationships.

16:42.656 --> 16:44.658
The one thing they never are
is simple.

16:47.313 --> 16:50.142
The capsule's tough
for a pulmonary nodule.

16:50.316 --> 16:51.578
The inside's friable,
crumbly.

16:52.840 --> 16:54.320
That's not cancer.

16:54.494 --> 16:56.322
It's fungus.

16:56.496 --> 16:58.455
And we just released it
into her bloodstream.

17:04.624 --> 17:06.973
What if we just let her
go home to see Viktor?

17:07.147 --> 17:08.497
It's one night.

17:08.671 --> 17:12.240
Dr. Allen,
she has grade four

17:12.414 --> 17:13.807
internal
and external hemorrhoids,

17:13.981 --> 17:15.590
which have
already ruptured.

17:15.765 --> 17:17.028
If it happens again
while she's home,

17:17.202 --> 17:18.507
she's at risk
for severe blood loss.

17:20.988 --> 17:22.207
I should tell her
about my first time.

17:26.472 --> 17:29.083
I vowed
that under no circumstances,

17:29.257 --> 17:30.998
I would be a virgin
when I went to college.

17:31.172 --> 17:33.305
Senior prom,
my high school boyfriend and I

17:33.479 --> 17:34.959
finally decided to take
that last big step past...

17:37.048 --> 17:39.615
"Heavy petting."

17:39.789 --> 17:42.314
Afterwards, all I could think
was "I preferred the petting."

17:42.488 --> 17:44.751
Mm, no second time
without a first time.

17:46.535 --> 17:48.624
Let's bring Viktor here.

17:48.798 --> 17:49.843
Afterwards,
we'll do the surgery,

17:50.017 --> 17:51.932
and if she has a rupture,

17:52.106 --> 17:53.978
there's no safer place to be
than in a hospital.

17:57.938 --> 18:00.897
The hospital has rules
against alcohol,

18:01.072 --> 18:03.813
illegal drugs,
patients running in socks,

18:03.988 --> 18:06.599
but there is nothing
about consensual sex.

18:11.386 --> 18:13.475
It's an illness commonly
known as Valley Fever.

18:13.649 --> 18:15.173
It's endemic to soil
in the Southwest.

18:16.783 --> 18:18.350
Our immediate concern is,

18:18.524 --> 18:20.308
the fungus is now
in your bloodstream.

18:20.482 --> 18:21.831
If an infection takes root
in your brain or spine,

18:22.006 --> 18:23.485
that could be fatal.

18:23.659 --> 18:24.791
We're gonna treat you
with an anti-fungal

18:24.965 --> 18:26.488
called amphotericin B.

18:26.662 --> 18:28.142
It can be pretty intense.

18:28.316 --> 18:30.492
The side effects include
nausea, violent chills,

18:30.666 --> 18:32.103
high fever, convulsions.

18:33.930 --> 18:34.583
Has Isaac been back?

18:36.672 --> 18:38.457
Um, we haven't seen him.

18:40.589 --> 18:42.591
We'll do what we can to
alleviate any discomfort.

18:44.985 --> 18:46.334
Get the infusion ready.

18:52.993 --> 18:54.821
Yeah?

18:54.995 --> 18:56.083
You're appointment only
now?

18:56.736 --> 18:58.390
It's fine.

18:58.564 --> 19:00.696
I had to establish
boundaries,

19:00.870 --> 19:02.524
at least until the hospital's
on firmer financial ground.

19:02.698 --> 19:04.918
Huh.

19:05.092 --> 19:07.181
There's a whole lot
of broken glass in the lab.

19:08.530 --> 19:10.271
Is that a metaphor?

19:10.445 --> 19:13.709
Yeah, and there's a whole lot
of broken glass in the lab.

19:13.883 --> 19:16.408
It's a supplier issue.
Apparently news to you?

19:16.582 --> 19:17.757
My assistant also
filters requests

19:17.931 --> 19:18.845
before they hit my desk.

19:19.019 --> 19:20.412
Allows me to focus

19:20.586 --> 19:21.761
on the bigger
post-Ethicure adjustments.

19:21.935 --> 19:23.589
Huh.Now, is there a reason

19:23.763 --> 19:25.286
for this...delightful,

19:25.460 --> 19:27.288
if unscheduled visit,
because...

19:27.462 --> 19:28.898
St. Bon's
needs a softball team.

19:29.073 --> 19:30.378
There's a hospital league.

19:30.552 --> 19:32.598
$650 covers a roster of 16.

19:32.772 --> 19:35.557
The team
covers bats and gloves.

19:35.731 --> 19:36.689
It'll be good for morale.

19:36.863 --> 19:38.212
You know,
I heard something

19:38.386 --> 19:41.563
about you playing softball
in Montana.

19:41.737 --> 19:42.651
What was your average?

19:43.783 --> 19:44.958
.394 and trending up.

19:45.132 --> 19:46.220
Hm.

19:49.832 --> 19:51.834
Fine. The hospital can cover
registration fee and uniforms.

19:52.008 --> 19:53.575
Gloves and bats
are on you.

19:53.749 --> 19:55.186
Next time,
make an appointment.

20:12.507 --> 20:13.291
Dr. Wolke?

20:14.379 --> 20:15.684
Sorry to interrupt.

20:15.858 --> 20:17.773
I'm just swiping left again.
Please, interrupt.

20:17.947 --> 20:19.688
I saw Ms. Torres
is going on ampho-B.

20:19.862 --> 20:21.168
Can we get her fiance back

20:21.342 --> 20:22.126
so she has
some emotional support?

20:23.997 --> 20:25.477
Uh, we tried.
He's not responding.

20:27.131 --> 20:28.697
Pretty lousy time
to ghost.

20:28.871 --> 20:32.223
Maybe, but I get it.

20:32.397 --> 20:33.572
You "get" taking off
when someone needs you?

20:35.182 --> 20:37.489
She lied to him for years.

20:37.663 --> 20:40.100
She hid things,
for pretty clear reasons.

20:40.274 --> 20:42.972
It's still
a violation of trust.

20:43.147 --> 20:44.191
That can take a while
to get over.

20:44.365 --> 20:46.802
Give him some time.Great empathy for him.

20:46.976 --> 20:48.456
Meanwhile, your patient is
about to be in a lot of pain,

20:48.630 --> 20:49.631
and you're judging her.

20:49.805 --> 20:51.677
I'm treating her.

20:51.851 --> 20:54.114
It is not my place to do
couples therapy. Or yours.

20:54.288 --> 20:56.464
If you don't have compassion
for her, Dr. Wolke,

20:56.638 --> 20:58.510
then maybe someone else
should handle her care.

20:58.684 --> 21:00.251
And you can go back to
polishing your Tinder profile.

21:03.645 --> 21:05.081
I have to hang her meds.

21:13.525 --> 21:14.482
You went all out.

21:14.656 --> 21:16.310
Mm-hmm.

21:16.484 --> 21:17.529
You didn't have
to bring those.

21:17.703 --> 21:19.052
I stole them
from the chapel.

21:19.226 --> 21:20.575
Oh.God works
in mysterious ways.

21:22.142 --> 21:23.230
Are you in any pain?

21:23.404 --> 21:25.058
No.
Lying here, I'm totally fine.

21:25.232 --> 21:26.277
It only hurts
when I walk around,

21:26.451 --> 21:30.019
but what about tomorrow,
when Viktor's...here?

21:30.194 --> 21:32.500
I got you covered.

21:32.674 --> 21:35.547
Tylenol,
a little Lidocaine cream.

21:35.721 --> 21:36.504
Should do the trick.

21:39.115 --> 21:40.813
You know, my mom had
the sex talk with me

21:40.987 --> 21:42.075
when I was
in the fifth grade.

21:42.249 --> 21:43.511
She showed me
The Joy of Sex,

21:43.685 --> 21:45.861
you know, that book
from the '70s.

21:46.035 --> 21:47.863
Lots of...hair.

21:49.735 --> 21:51.998
And, uh, when I asked her
to explain the pictures,

21:52.172 --> 21:54.783
she got really awkward
and then started to cry.

21:56.655 --> 21:59.353
That's not
very sex-positive.

21:59.527 --> 22:00.963
Well, she said she was upset
because I was so young

22:01.137 --> 22:03.966
and I was asking
all these questions.

22:04.140 --> 22:06.926
I just ended up rubbing her back
and making her a cup of tea.

22:07.100 --> 22:07.796
Oh.

22:10.059 --> 22:12.671
After wanting this for so many
years, why am I so scared?

22:14.673 --> 22:17.241
Being intimate with someone
feels vulnerable,

22:17.415 --> 22:19.025
no matter how many times
you've done it.

22:19.895 --> 22:21.332
That's why it's special.

22:23.203 --> 22:24.857
It will be an adventure...

22:25.031 --> 22:27.860
Your adventure,
on your terms.

22:28.034 --> 22:30.079
Have fun,

22:30.254 --> 22:31.864
tell him what you want,

22:32.038 --> 22:33.431
and lube is your friend.

22:34.780 --> 22:35.868
Oh, my God.

22:39.437 --> 22:41.830
It's all about
setting the mood.

23:09.684 --> 23:11.207
Tonight, there will be
no brakes.

23:11.382 --> 23:12.470
Oh.

23:12.644 --> 23:13.862
Only accelerators.

23:15.211 --> 23:16.604
Oh.

23:16.778 --> 23:18.389
Including wine.

23:18.563 --> 23:19.520
Oh, my God.

23:19.694 --> 23:20.869
And...

23:22.001 --> 23:23.742
A relaxing massage.

23:27.267 --> 23:29.356
I've researched
the best massages on YouTube

23:29.530 --> 23:31.097
and have been practicing...

23:31.271 --> 23:32.141
On a pillow.

23:33.491 --> 23:34.492
Okay.

23:37.408 --> 23:38.147
Yes.

23:50.290 --> 23:52.205
Mmm...

23:54.555 --> 23:57.210
Mm,
you havebeen practicing.

23:57.384 --> 23:59.386
You are much better
than a pillow.

23:59.560 --> 24:00.822
Mm.

24:00.996 --> 24:02.171
How's your back now?

24:02.346 --> 24:03.912
Much better.

24:06.480 --> 24:07.263
Would you like
a chocolate?

24:07.438 --> 24:09.353
Mm. Mm-hmm.

24:48.870 --> 24:50.002
You took these?

24:51.612 --> 24:55.181
Mm. On my last trip,
Imperial Valley.

24:55.355 --> 24:56.225
They're beautiful.

24:58.402 --> 24:59.968
So...relaxed.

25:01.535 --> 25:02.449
Just a bunch of friends
hanging out.

25:02.623 --> 25:04.669
Yeah.

25:04.843 --> 25:07.759
There are so many images
out there of the, uh, plight

25:07.933 --> 25:10.979
of the undocumented,
like we're just some sad story.

25:12.633 --> 25:13.982
I wanted to show
how we really are...

25:15.331 --> 25:16.463
Cracking jokes,
laughing,

25:17.769 --> 25:18.726
a bunch of badasses.

25:20.685 --> 25:22.295
Oh, not that I feel that way
at the moment.

25:22.469 --> 25:23.688
Oh!

25:23.862 --> 25:24.776
I can call Isaac again.

25:26.604 --> 25:27.561
Don't bother.

25:29.563 --> 25:32.261
If he doesn't see
how scary this all is,

25:32.436 --> 25:35.090
if he can't support me,
then I don't want him here.

25:48.147 --> 25:49.235
When I was in high school,

25:51.106 --> 25:52.543
I had a chavrusa...

25:52.717 --> 25:53.805
A study partner.

25:55.415 --> 25:57.591
I totally fell for him.

25:57.765 --> 25:59.463
His close textual readings
were super sexy.

26:01.116 --> 26:02.553
We grew up Hasidic.

26:04.555 --> 26:07.340
Micah was the first person
I told about being gay...

26:08.602 --> 26:09.647
And my first kiss.

26:11.344 --> 26:12.519
He said he was gay, too.

26:14.565 --> 26:17.176
That according
to two verses in Samuel,

26:17.350 --> 26:19.047
so were
King David and Jonathan.

26:21.049 --> 26:22.747
Like I said,
close textual readings.

26:22.921 --> 26:23.878
Next level.

26:27.882 --> 26:29.057
Micah said
we should be open.

26:30.885 --> 26:31.756
We should
tell our families.

26:34.628 --> 26:36.064
I was scared, but I did,

26:37.413 --> 26:38.850
And my dad...

26:41.940 --> 26:42.636
...lost it.

26:45.030 --> 26:48.294
Our home
just...imploded.

26:50.949 --> 26:52.080
But Micah backed out.

26:54.213 --> 26:55.475
He said
he couldn't do it.

26:58.522 --> 26:59.435
I lost my family

27:01.046 --> 27:02.917
and never spoke
to Micah again.

27:05.267 --> 27:06.747
He cut you off?

27:06.921 --> 27:08.096
I cut himoff.

27:09.968 --> 27:13.624
He reached out to me,
but I... I was so angry.

27:16.061 --> 27:17.671
He betrayed me and...

27:19.978 --> 27:21.370
Broke my heart.

27:22.981 --> 27:25.853
And then I realized
how terrified

27:26.027 --> 27:27.420
he must have been, too.

27:29.727 --> 27:30.684
And how...

27:32.556 --> 27:34.122
Alone he must feel now.

27:37.561 --> 27:39.084
I miss him.

27:46.482 --> 27:47.614
O2 falling.

27:49.311 --> 27:50.008
Is this from the ampho-B?

27:50.182 --> 27:51.139
No.

27:52.532 --> 27:54.447
EKG steady.It's not her heart.

27:58.146 --> 28:01.019
The area around
the nodule ruptured.

28:01.193 --> 28:02.716
Your lung has collapsed.
We need to get her to the O.R.

28:05.843 --> 28:08.063
Completing
final muscular suture.

28:08.237 --> 28:09.717
Lung is
reinflating nicely.

28:09.891 --> 28:12.241
Let's finish
closing her up.

28:12.415 --> 28:14.069
Dr. Lim? Who's talking to me?

28:14.243 --> 28:15.592
This is Nurse Martel.

28:15.766 --> 28:16.767
Her renal panel
just came back.

28:18.073 --> 28:19.205
How bad?

28:19.379 --> 28:21.772
B.U.N. 30, creatinine 4.

28:24.688 --> 28:25.559
Thanks
for letting us know.

28:28.214 --> 28:29.563
It's impacting
both her kidneys.

28:29.737 --> 28:30.999
We need to get that nodule
out of there.

28:31.173 --> 28:32.566
Now?No.

28:32.740 --> 28:34.785
There's still too much fungus
circulating in her blood.

28:34.959 --> 28:36.439
She needs around round
of ampho-B

28:36.613 --> 28:39.094
to clear as much fungus
as we can.

28:39.268 --> 28:40.922
Then we can do
the kidney surgery.

28:51.498 --> 28:52.194
Are you Viktor?

28:53.500 --> 28:55.328
Brenna showed me
your picture.

28:55.502 --> 28:57.982
I'm Dr. Allen.Pleased to meet you.

28:58.156 --> 28:59.897
Perhaps you could point me
toward the gift shop?

29:00.071 --> 29:01.769
I wanted to get something
for Brenna.

29:01.943 --> 29:03.379
What kind of a date
shows up empty-handed?

29:03.553 --> 29:05.163
Most of them.

29:05.338 --> 29:07.644
I am Dr. Shaun Murphy.
Give her these.

29:07.818 --> 29:09.603
Chocolate contains tryptophan
and Phenylethylamine,

29:09.777 --> 29:10.865
which will help to elevate
your moods.

29:15.130 --> 29:17.741
Oh, they are very good.

29:17.915 --> 29:19.830
Okay, please get started.

29:20.004 --> 29:21.528
As soon as you are done,
we can do the procedure.

29:21.702 --> 29:24.835
Oh, uh, I owe it to Brenna
not to rush.

29:26.315 --> 29:28.012
Definitely worth the wait.

29:35.977 --> 29:37.500
You're here.

29:37.674 --> 29:40.242
Uh, bearing
slightly used chocolates.

29:42.505 --> 29:45.682
Uh, Dr. Murphy says they...
they will improve our mood,

29:45.856 --> 29:47.554
w-which
I hope won't be necessary.

29:50.687 --> 29:51.732
Always the gentleman.

29:54.822 --> 29:58.216
Are you sure
this isn't too strange?

29:58.391 --> 30:01.350
Uh, well, making love
in a hospital is strange.

30:03.483 --> 30:07.138
And surprising
and... and completely unique.

30:07.313 --> 30:09.097
Exciting.

30:10.881 --> 30:12.492
I'll be outside,
guarding the door.

30:14.102 --> 30:14.929
Try not to be too loud.

30:26.549 --> 30:27.898
Yo.
See you on the field.

30:30.423 --> 30:31.728
I gave you your team.
My involvement ends there.

30:32.990 --> 30:34.818
You're a baller, right?

30:34.992 --> 30:36.733
You played in college.

30:36.907 --> 30:38.735
Yeah, I also ate instant ramen
for breakfast.

30:38.909 --> 30:40.650
I need a shortstop,
a field general,

30:40.824 --> 30:42.043
a boss of the infield.
You're perfect.

30:42.217 --> 30:44.045
I'm busy being
the actual boss.

30:44.219 --> 30:45.655
You're busy
being a bad boss.

30:48.397 --> 30:50.268
You isolate yourself
from your own staff.

30:50.443 --> 30:51.879
They don't like you.

30:52.053 --> 30:53.402
Especially since
this business with Salen.

30:56.187 --> 30:58.015
I've got bridges to build.
I'll get there eventually.

30:58.189 --> 31:00.670
I'm offering you a bridge
to build right now.

31:00.844 --> 31:02.411
Show them
you're on their team.

31:02.585 --> 31:03.586
Maybe they'll help you
right the ship.

31:03.760 --> 31:05.240
I know.
Mixed metaphor.

31:05.414 --> 31:07.460
And by the way,
maybe they'll stop bothering me

31:07.634 --> 31:09.244
with their problems
every five minutes.

31:27.393 --> 31:28.742
Let's have sex.

31:28.916 --> 31:29.873
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

31:30.047 --> 31:31.962
Shaun! Oh, my God!
I'm so sorry!

31:32.615 --> 31:33.660
Okay.

31:33.834 --> 31:34.965
Are you okay?

31:36.706 --> 31:38.795
Spontaneity
is not the solution.

31:38.969 --> 31:40.884
No.

31:41.058 --> 31:42.538
Sorry.

31:42.712 --> 31:43.974
Okay.

31:48.111 --> 31:50.940
Maybe we could try

31:51.114 --> 31:54.726
more of a...
planned surprise next time.

31:54.900 --> 31:57.076
That is a good idea.

31:57.250 --> 31:58.904
We should have
a sex schedule.

31:59.078 --> 31:59.992
Jordan recommended it.

32:01.690 --> 32:02.386
Did you mention
my morale boosting?

32:02.560 --> 32:03.953
N-No.

32:04.127 --> 32:05.737
Lea,
that is very personal.

32:05.911 --> 32:06.999
Yeah. Yeah, it is.

32:10.612 --> 32:13.092
The...
The sex schedule... sorry...

32:13.266 --> 32:15.399
It just feels like
the ultimate buzzkill.

32:16.400 --> 32:18.054
Okay.

32:18.228 --> 32:20.796
Lou the janitor mentioned
something called a sex swing,

32:20.970 --> 32:25.061
but the installation
sounds very cumbersome.

32:25.235 --> 32:27.716
Even allowing for foreplay,
Viktor should be finished.

32:31.589 --> 32:32.590
Uh...

32:39.292 --> 32:41.251
God.

32:41.425 --> 32:43.471
This feels worse
than the last time.

32:43.645 --> 32:46.822
The nausea, the pain...

32:46.996 --> 32:48.780
We have to clear
as much fungus from your blood

32:48.954 --> 32:49.781
as possible
before surgery.

32:58.442 --> 32:59.661
I got your message.

33:02.490 --> 33:03.360
Thanks for coming back.

33:05.884 --> 33:07.059
You lied to me.

33:09.453 --> 33:12.151
I don't know
what's going on anymore.

33:13.588 --> 33:14.850
Or what to trust.

33:16.678 --> 33:17.635
Of course you don't.

33:19.985 --> 33:20.856
I didn't give you
a chance.

33:23.598 --> 33:25.904
I didn't trust you,
and I should have.

33:28.907 --> 33:31.562
You don't have
to forgive me,

33:31.736 --> 33:35.087
but I-I hope you...
You understand...

33:38.177 --> 33:40.092
...why I hid from you.

34:05.378 --> 34:06.554
Seriously, I thought
they'd be done by now.

34:10.382 --> 34:11.688
This is
Dr. Shaun Murphy.

34:15.301 --> 34:16.433
Help.

34:21.743 --> 34:23.353
Mm.

34:23.527 --> 34:24.223
Um...

34:28.053 --> 34:29.577
What happened?

34:29.751 --> 34:30.926
Well, um, we finished...

34:32.231 --> 34:33.406
Both of us.

34:33.581 --> 34:34.320
Yay.

34:34.494 --> 34:36.844
Um, but we...

34:37.018 --> 34:40.196
Um...he's...I-I-I seem to be stuck.

34:41.893 --> 34:43.851
Oh, you must have
vaginismus.

34:44.025 --> 34:45.549
What?

34:45.723 --> 34:47.246
Your pelvic floor
is having a muscle spasm,

34:47.420 --> 34:48.117
and it's holding...Oh!

34:48.291 --> 34:49.379
Shaun.

34:49.553 --> 34:52.251
It's very rare in humans,

34:52.425 --> 34:54.253
but it is common in mammals
who need to ensure fertilization.

34:58.083 --> 34:59.781
Once your pelvic walls
relax,

35:01.609 --> 35:03.045
everything should go
back to normal.

35:03.219 --> 35:05.482
Oh, my God.

35:05.656 --> 35:08.311
I am so sorry.
You came to do me a favor,

35:08.485 --> 35:10.922
and now we're literally stuck.No, stop, stop,
stop, stop, stop.

35:11.096 --> 35:12.184
This is a beautiful choice
you made.

35:14.883 --> 35:16.841
And now that I know that
we're gonna be okay, uh...

35:18.277 --> 35:19.670
It's actually quite nice.

35:21.890 --> 35:22.630
Yes, it is.

35:27.460 --> 35:28.287
That was...

35:30.333 --> 35:31.900
Lovely.

35:47.829 --> 35:48.481
Mm.

35:50.570 --> 35:52.398
I owe you an apology.

35:52.572 --> 35:54.183
It's okay.

35:54.357 --> 35:55.706
The ice packs
are really helping.

35:55.880 --> 35:57.621
Not that.

35:57.795 --> 36:00.189
I'm sorry
for brushing you off.

36:00.363 --> 36:02.278
You've been trying to get us
out of this dry spell,

36:02.452 --> 36:03.105
and I've done nothing.

36:06.456 --> 36:08.284
About the sex schedule...

36:10.373 --> 36:11.766
My parents used
to have one.

36:13.768 --> 36:16.031
They used to mark our
kitchen calendar with "S.T."

36:16.205 --> 36:17.989
They claimed it was
for "Steak Tonight,"

36:18.163 --> 36:20.209
but we didn't have steak
that often.

36:20.383 --> 36:23.908
We finally realized it stood
for... "Sexy Time."

36:25.562 --> 36:26.476
Oh.

36:28.086 --> 36:31.133
I-I don't want my sex life
to be like my parents'.

36:34.179 --> 36:36.268
But they have been married
for 42 years.

36:37.530 --> 36:38.967
Yeah, they have.

36:39.750 --> 36:42.535
They seem happy.

36:42.710 --> 36:44.537
I think it is nice that they still
want to touch each other.

36:46.670 --> 36:48.716
I need to go remove
some hemorrhoids.

36:54.707 --> 36:57.291
We removed the nodule, and your
kidney function is improving.

36:59.233 --> 37:01.495
A few rounds of ampho-B to go,
but we think you're in the clear.

37:04.577 --> 37:05.404
Thank you, Dr. Park.

37:08.020 --> 37:10.196
We'll get through this.
All of it.

37:11.371 --> 37:13.417
And I won't freak out again.

37:14.191 --> 37:15.105
I'll step up.

37:18.199 --> 37:20.245
I'm sorry.

37:20.419 --> 37:22.116
Sorry it took me so long.

37:24.945 --> 37:25.772
You and me?

37:29.428 --> 37:31.299
Yeah. You and me.

37:41.880 --> 37:43.360
How did I do?

37:43.534 --> 37:45.405
The surgery was a success.

37:45.579 --> 37:47.146
And as long as you follow
the recovery protocols,

37:47.320 --> 37:48.452
you should have
no further problems.

37:50.192 --> 37:53.152
Look who I found
in the gift shop.

37:53.326 --> 37:56.155
I wanted to see how you were doing
and uh, give you these.

37:56.764 --> 37:59.114
Aww.

37:59.289 --> 38:02.379
And ask if you might be open
to another visit next month.

38:04.859 --> 38:06.687
There's a polar microbes
conference in San Francisco

38:06.861 --> 38:10.082
that I, uh,
was considering attending.

38:11.562 --> 38:12.519
I'd love that.

38:23.617 --> 38:25.532
Cafeteria closed
while you were in the O.R.,

38:25.706 --> 38:27.186
so I sat a couple
of meal trays aside.

38:27.360 --> 38:29.362
Oh, my God.
I'm starving.

38:29.536 --> 38:30.885
Thank you.

38:32.365 --> 38:33.453
And...

38:35.237 --> 38:36.891
Thanks for the push.

38:41.896 --> 38:43.376
We've got grilled salmon.

38:43.550 --> 38:45.596
Can be a little dry,

38:45.770 --> 38:48.207
although Ms. Shenoy in 314
seems to like it.

38:48.381 --> 38:49.817
Mm.Penne pesto.

38:49.991 --> 38:52.777
Sounds promising, I know,
but lower your expectations.

38:52.951 --> 38:55.649
Oh.And finally,

38:55.823 --> 38:57.216
the humble-but-classic
grilled chicken.

38:57.390 --> 38:58.652
Mm.

38:58.826 --> 39:00.219
Even my 5-year-old niece
loves it,

39:00.393 --> 39:01.568
and she's got the palate
of a 5-year-old.

39:03.570 --> 39:04.441
I would have gone
with the pesto.

39:05.093 --> 39:06.094
I could tell.

39:06.268 --> 39:07.313
I'm sold.

39:07.487 --> 39:08.575
Hit me
with that chicken.

39:08.749 --> 39:09.924
You got it.

39:15.930 --> 39:17.105
Unless we head over
to Tres Reyes,

39:17.279 --> 39:19.369
upgrade
to insanely good tamales.

39:26.811 --> 39:29.944
Are you...asking me out?

39:30.118 --> 39:32.643
In, like, a date-y way?

39:35.385 --> 39:36.168
Looks like it.

39:36.342 --> 39:37.474
Wait.

39:38.605 --> 39:39.432
You're gay?

39:41.173 --> 39:42.435
Nothing gets by you, huh?

39:49.224 --> 39:54.534
An upgrade to insanely good
tamales sounds perfect.

40:02.281 --> 40:03.630
All right, Reznick!

40:03.804 --> 40:04.457
Way to battle.Aw!

40:06.894 --> 40:09.462
Park, you're up!
Allen on deck.

40:09.636 --> 40:12.247
I got some intel. First up
is a fastball, followed by a change-up.

40:12.422 --> 40:14.511
Yeah, that's because he
doesn't have anything else, man.

40:14.685 --> 40:16.687
His curve ball's a disaster.Good to know.

40:16.861 --> 40:19.907
All right. You got this.Dilallo, in the hole.

40:20.081 --> 40:22.170
Oh. It's 7:45.Yeah.

40:22.344 --> 40:23.781
Sorry. Gotta go.

40:23.955 --> 40:24.695
What do you mean,
you gotta go?

40:24.869 --> 40:25.913
You're... You're
the cleanup hitter.

40:26.087 --> 40:26.827
We are on a schedule.

40:29.177 --> 40:30.440
Go, Park!

40:30.614 --> 40:32.398
Oh!

40:32.572 --> 40:34.226
Strike!Ah!

40:34.400 --> 40:35.575
Oh, that's a ball!
That was high!

40:35.749 --> 40:37.577
0-1!

40:37.751 --> 40:38.839
Nice turn on
that double play last inning.

40:39.797 --> 40:41.320
Thanks.

40:41.494 --> 40:43.540
If only you could handle our schedule
with the same skill.

40:45.672 --> 40:48.240
1 and 1.

40:48.414 --> 40:49.850
You got some ideas?

40:50.024 --> 40:50.938
Actually, yeah.

40:58.380 --> 40:59.120
I'm listening.

41:03.298 --> 41:04.735
Oh!

41:06.127 --> 41:07.520
Go, Park! Yeah!
Good job, man!

41:07.694 --> 41:09.740
Park!

41:19.750 --> 41:22.317
It just feels
a little weird.

41:22.492 --> 41:26.583
Like we're on the clock,
you know?

41:26.757 --> 41:29.716
I would offer you a chocolate
to help you relax,

41:29.890 --> 41:32.240
but I gave them away
to Viktor.

41:32.414 --> 41:34.155
Who's Viktor?

41:34.329 --> 41:37.028
A very nice Arctic explorer
who came to the hospital

41:37.202 --> 41:38.072
to have sex
with my patient.

41:38.812 --> 41:39.900
Oh.

41:40.901 --> 41:42.381
How full service.

41:43.730 --> 41:46.385
It was remarkable.

41:46.559 --> 41:49.344
His penis got stuck
in my patient's vagina.

41:53.958 --> 41:55.394
No, it didn't.

41:55.568 --> 41:56.830
Oh, yes, it did.

41:57.004 --> 41:58.092
No.

41:58.266 --> 41:59.224
It did.

42:07.754 --> 42:08.581
Come here.

42:11.236 --> 42:12.237
Oh.

42:14.042 --> 42:16.542
