NARRATOR:
<i>Previously on </i>Hill Street Blues...

00:03.461 --> 00:06.631
-I am wearing a toupee.
-If they offer you this job,

00:07.007 --> 00:08.299
we'll have a lot to talk about, won't we?

00:08.383 --> 00:12.220
The new promotions,
who got promoted, Phil? Who?

00:12.303 --> 00:14.472
I get this way when I've been up all night

00:14.556 --> 00:16.474
phoning a hotel
where you never checked in.

00:16.558 --> 00:19.436
You took me to dinner
every Saturday night for a month!

00:19.686 --> 00:22.397
Now I want to know what happened to us!

00:22.480 --> 00:25.025
The simple truth is that
I've met somebody else.

00:25.108 --> 00:27.444
I stayed there because it was nicer
than a hotel room

00:27.527 --> 00:28.820
and he was nice enough to offer.

00:28.903 --> 00:30.947
I have to know.
Did you sleep with this guy?

00:33.742 --> 00:35.535
(indistinct conversations)

00:39.748 --> 00:40.790
ESTERHAUS: Item nine.

00:42.083 --> 00:42.959
People!

00:43.376 --> 00:46.629
A little forbearance, please!

00:47.005 --> 00:47.839
Thank you.

00:49.132 --> 00:52.969
You will note Officer Bugburn
passing out amongst you

00:53.595 --> 00:57.265
the new 1983 revised
and unexpurgated edition

00:57.348 --> 00:59.601
-of the departmental manual.
-(crowd groans)

00:59.684 --> 01:02.228
I can well understand your dismay,

01:02.312 --> 01:06.566
as I myself do not look forward
to an in-depth study of this material.

01:06.941 --> 01:09.444
Chapter headings such as
"The Denver Boot,"

01:09.694 --> 01:13.031
"Innovations in Passive
Vehicular Immobilization"

01:13.656 --> 01:15.700
do not whet one's appetite for learning.

01:16.493 --> 01:18.495
Nevertheless, it remains
our duty to stay current

01:18.578 --> 01:21.331
with our agency's ever-changing
rules and procedures,

01:21.414 --> 01:23.041
so I implore you,

01:23.541 --> 01:29.005
please take a few precious off-duty hours
in the perusal of said tome.

01:30.048 --> 01:31.341
-Just what I'm gonna do.
-Yeah.

01:31.424 --> 01:33.218
ESTERHAUS: All right, item 10,
wants and warrants,

01:33.301 --> 01:34.928
short and sweet, so listen up.

01:35.011 --> 01:39.432
Be on the lookout
for one Roland J. Thompson,

01:40.225 --> 01:43.728
also known as "Hardball,"
"Cue Ball," or "Dr. T."

01:44.479 --> 01:47.232
He's a male Black, 5'7", 145 pounds,

01:47.315 --> 01:51.152
distinguishing characteristic,
being a totally bald pate.

01:51.236 --> 01:54.239
Last spotted driving a '76 gray Cutlass,

01:54.823 --> 01:57.784
license plate 053 apple David baker.

01:57.867 --> 02:01.287
Also be on the alert this a.m.
for a Herbert D. Ponzatino,

02:01.788 --> 02:04.874
a male Caucasian, brown hair, brown eyes,
5'10", heavyset.

02:04.958 --> 02:08.753
Prime suspect in the avenue "B"
housing project rapes.

02:08.837 --> 02:11.005
Let's put a little extra
into that one, people,

02:11.089 --> 02:16.886
as Mr. Ponzatino's aberrant appetites
appear to be on the rise.

02:17.846 --> 02:20.807
Item 11. Detective Belker
will be staking out

02:20.890 --> 02:24.269
the Shop 'n Save 24-hour market
this a.m...

02:24.352 --> 02:27.355
-(barking)
-...pursuant to a 34 percent increase

02:27.438 --> 02:30.650
in purse snatching and rob assaults

02:30.733 --> 02:32.610
on the patrons of said establishment.

02:32.694 --> 02:35.405
Motor patrols, be alert to that situation.

02:35.655 --> 02:39.367
Item last, the senior criminology class

02:39.826 --> 02:42.996
-of the St. Mary's girls high school...
-MAN: Oh...

02:43.079 --> 02:46.457
...will be guests on the premises
for the next three days

02:46.541 --> 02:48.042
under my direct supervision.

02:48.126 --> 02:50.170
(men chuckle)

02:50.253 --> 02:51.713
Needless to say,

02:52.338 --> 02:56.301
these young ladies are to be shown
the utmost courtesy

02:56.885 --> 02:58.720
by the officers of this precinct.

02:59.304 --> 03:02.932
And be reminded as well that I expect
a code of conduct that is exemplary,

03:03.641 --> 03:08.771
language-wise, behavior-wise,
and every which way otherwise.

03:08.855 --> 03:11.357
(indistinct conversations)

03:11.441 --> 03:12.567
All right, that's it. Let's roll.

03:14.110 --> 03:15.653
And hey, hey, hey!

03:16.571 --> 03:18.531
Let's be careful out there.

03:19.657 --> 03:21.367
Hey, Sarge, are you sure
you don't need any help

03:21.451 --> 03:22.535
on that supervision?

03:30.710 --> 03:32.462
My God, Neal. Have you ever seen

03:32.545 --> 03:36.507
some of these teenage chicks' firm,
young bosoms bursting to be free,

03:36.591 --> 03:39.761
short, pleated skirts
caressing golden down

03:39.844 --> 03:43.389
across an expansive, firm, white thigh?

03:43.473 --> 03:45.433
You're a sick man, J.D.

03:46.601 --> 03:48.394
I know, I know. I just can't help it.

03:48.478 --> 03:51.105
Yeah. I think I'm gonna take
this new departmental manual

03:51.189 --> 03:53.566
-to my pit stop this morning...
-Damn

03:53.650 --> 03:55.902
in case they run out of sanitary wipes.

03:56.694 --> 03:59.489
Ma, there's nothing to be concerned about.

04:00.281 --> 04:02.992
Yes, they called me, so I know
they put him in the hospital ward,

04:03.076 --> 04:05.119
but the doctor said it's only a cold.

04:07.163 --> 04:08.998
It's a simple precautionary, Ma.

04:09.082 --> 04:12.418
The doctor said at that age,
if you don't watch it--

04:14.671 --> 04:16.798
It's not pneumonia, Ma. Don't be silly.

04:17.215 --> 04:20.176
They're only concerned that it
shouldn't get into the lung, that's all.

04:22.178 --> 04:23.596
They're giving him...

04:26.724 --> 04:28.017
Tetracycline.

04:30.603 --> 04:32.230
Don't worry about the money,
would you please?

04:32.313 --> 04:34.065
I already authorized the addition.

04:35.858 --> 04:37.360
Don't keep saying that.

04:39.112 --> 04:43.658
According to the doctor,
it's a simple prophylactic measure.

04:45.034 --> 04:48.121
Ma, Ma... Ma!

04:49.580 --> 04:53.084
It doesn't mean what you think it means.
It has nothing to do with sex.

04:53.167 --> 04:55.712
WOMAN (on radio):<i> Dispatch.</i>
<i>We have a 9-11.</i>

04:56.587 --> 04:57.839
<i>Armed robbery in progress,</i>

04:57.922 --> 05:01.718
<i>Surplus Store, corner of People's Drive</i>
<i>and 124th Street.</i>

05:03.428 --> 05:05.513
(theme music playing)

06:09.952 --> 06:13.081
(siren wailing)

06:21.172 --> 06:22.090
Sure.

06:22.423 --> 06:24.509
Sure, a week before the prelim
will be fine. Yeah.

06:26.594 --> 06:28.721
Uh-huh. Yeah, thanks, Don.

06:30.640 --> 06:33.643
Yo, Frankie, I got a driver
waiting for me outside,

06:33.726 --> 06:37.438
and I've been cooling my heels here
12 minutes already.

06:38.147 --> 06:41.025
I got a nine o'clock crosstown brunch
with my broker.

06:41.234 --> 06:42.151
So, what's up?

06:42.902 --> 06:45.655
This is what's up. You want to fill me in?

06:49.367 --> 06:53.579
Looks like a standard financial disclosure
for the union securities exchange.

06:53.663 --> 06:55.248
Uh-huh, with your signature at the bottom

06:55.331 --> 06:57.834
and my name in it
as your prime credit reference.

06:57.917 --> 07:02.672
Oh, I would have put down Pepe Hernandez,
but he got turned down for parole.

07:02.755 --> 07:04.715
What the hell's going on here, Jesus?

07:04.799 --> 07:07.176
According to this,
you've invested nearly 50,000 dollars

07:07.260 --> 07:10.930
in some kind of commodity-futures deal.

07:11.764 --> 07:13.057
Beans.

07:13.141 --> 07:16.227
My broker tells me
if it rains in Georgia next month,

07:16.310 --> 07:20.273
I can turn this paper over
for a cool 1.5 million,

07:21.232 --> 07:25.278
unless you rather I go off the book
and deal Peruvian yap serum

07:25.361 --> 07:29.031
like most of the dudes
in my social-economic tide pool.

07:29.490 --> 07:30.908
Come on, Frankie.

07:31.367 --> 07:33.453
Let me get my nose
on the white man's trough.

07:34.370 --> 07:36.247
In case you've forgotten, Jesus,

07:36.330 --> 07:40.334
the grant proposal you submitted
was for a local youth-recreation program.

07:41.210 --> 07:45.256
What's 50 lousy Gs worth
of basketball and high-tops?

07:46.215 --> 07:52.472
Besides, preliminary accounts to the feds
is not due for five weeks.

07:52.763 --> 07:56.184
By then I'll have enough money
to buy 'em a whole damn country club.

07:56.267 --> 07:57.810
Get my name off your credit reference.

07:57.894 --> 08:00.521
If you want to spend the next five years
upstate, do it without my help, okay?

08:02.899 --> 08:04.025
Okay, Frankie.

08:05.067 --> 08:08.571
Mark my words, what you see
standing here before you today

08:08.821 --> 08:10.490
is the next Robert Vesco.

08:11.324 --> 08:13.993
Robert Vesco is wanted
in over 14 countries

08:14.076 --> 08:17.788
on about 5 dozen counts
of international securities fraud.

08:18.915 --> 08:19.790
Whatever.

08:27.507 --> 08:29.550
I'm not even going to ask
what that was about.

08:29.634 --> 08:31.344
Believe me, you're better off.

08:34.764 --> 08:35.932
Aren't you a few hours early?

08:36.015 --> 08:38.809
I've got an assault case
left over from last night,

08:39.227 --> 08:42.230
a regular one-man wrecking crew,
according to his arrest sheet.

08:43.439 --> 08:45.650
We'll, uh, station a uniform
in there with you.

08:45.733 --> 08:49.195
That's okay. I've got a good 10 rounds
left in my mace canister.

08:51.197 --> 08:53.783
Frank, do you mind if I take a rain check
on lunch today?

08:55.117 --> 08:57.954
Clark Galloway's flying out
from Washington on the morning shuttle.

08:59.121 --> 09:00.248
I take it you got the job.

09:01.123 --> 09:02.875
I suppose I'll find that out at lunch.

09:03.417 --> 09:05.253
Really, Frank, I have no idea.

09:05.503 --> 09:08.839
Excuse me, Miss Davenport.
Your suspect is in Interrogation One.

09:09.090 --> 09:10.049
Thank you, Sergeant.

09:11.884 --> 09:13.302
I'll let you know after lunch.

09:18.099 --> 09:19.475
CALLETANO: "The senior officer
at a police..."

09:19.559 --> 09:21.686
"The rank of the deputy is determined..."

09:21.769 --> 09:26.232
(overlapping dialog)

09:26.315 --> 09:27.817
-"...When an incident has re--"
-Has been ordered, Henry--

09:27.900 --> 09:29.402
"When an incident has reached a point

09:29.485 --> 09:31.320
where the remaining functions
are investigative

09:31.404 --> 09:35.449
and the senior concerned detective
should be in command,

09:35.533 --> 09:37.451
assuming such command
by identifying himself

09:37.535 --> 09:39.203
and informing the officer
then in command."

09:39.287 --> 09:41.831
Besides which you never really
identify yourself.

09:41.914 --> 09:44.750
Do you want it in neon, Ray?
For God's sake, here you go.

09:45.084 --> 09:47.336
Detective-lieutenant,
Lieutenant. Detective.

09:47.420 --> 09:48.754
Do you mind telling me what's going on?

09:48.838 --> 09:50.631
I was merely instructing
the junior lieutenant

09:50.715 --> 09:52.425
in the fine points of rank determination.

09:52.508 --> 09:55.344
Our house junkie got sick
on some lawyer's car in the lot, Frank.

09:55.428 --> 09:57.346
It was a bailiff's car,
and I got there first.

09:57.430 --> 09:59.181
I was just trying to break up a fight,
for God's sake.

09:59.265 --> 10:01.267
I had the situation under control,
thank you very much.

10:01.350 --> 10:02.560
Gentlemen!

10:03.185 --> 10:05.229
I think it's time we all three
had a talk, don't you?

10:05.313 --> 10:07.356
Since I suddenly find myself
available for lunch,

10:07.440 --> 10:09.942
suppose we meet in a few hours
and get to the bottom of this.

10:10.985 --> 10:12.194
I'll phone the galley for a table.

10:12.278 --> 10:13.321
That's over 20 blocks from here.

10:13.404 --> 10:15.114
-I'll call Luis's.
-Luis's?

10:15.197 --> 10:17.950
I'll pick the restaurant, okay,
gentlemen? Agreed?

10:21.412 --> 10:24.498
State health found a dog collar
behind Luis's last month.

10:26.292 --> 10:27.376
I don't know what they're talking about.

10:27.918 --> 10:30.171
I was sipping a beer,
minding my own business,

10:30.588 --> 10:32.923
when this big weight-lifter type
comes over and he starts--

10:33.007 --> 10:36.886
5'6", 145 pounds?

10:38.262 --> 10:39.263
Must have been the lighting.

10:40.473 --> 10:43.809
Anyway, he follows me into the john,
and he starts physically attacking me.

10:44.185 --> 10:45.102
It was terrible.

10:45.186 --> 10:47.605
I've got statements here
on the crime report

10:47.688 --> 10:50.107
from three witnesses
that<i> you </i>followed him into the washroom.

10:50.399 --> 10:51.525
No. You're kidding.

10:52.193 --> 10:54.904
Mr. Crockett, it's not exactly
classified information

10:54.987 --> 10:57.198
that you've been working
as a collection enforcer

10:57.281 --> 11:00.034
for a loan shark
by the name of Tobias Wolfe

11:00.117 --> 11:01.786
for the past several years.

11:01.869 --> 11:03.371
It's also a matter of record

11:03.454 --> 11:05.956
that the victim of this assault
was in arrears to Mr. Wolfe

11:06.040 --> 11:07.958
for the amount of 8,000 dollars.

11:08.042 --> 11:09.543
You got a great bod, mama.

11:09.960 --> 11:11.587
What are you doing for breakfast tomorrow?

11:11.671 --> 11:13.255
Quit wasting my time, Crockett.

11:13.589 --> 11:15.341
In case you slept
through the introductions,

11:15.424 --> 11:17.218
I'm your lawyer. I'm representing you.

11:18.010 --> 11:20.137
So unless you want to walk
into that courtroom

11:20.388 --> 11:22.973
with just your questionable wit
and a three-page rap sheet,

11:23.057 --> 11:25.351
I suggest you cut the crap
and tell me what really happened

11:25.434 --> 11:26.560
or I'm out of here.

11:27.269 --> 11:28.187
Keep a secret?

11:29.939 --> 11:33.234
All lawyer-client correspondence
is regarded by law

11:33.317 --> 11:34.860
as privileged communication.

11:35.986 --> 11:39.490
Well, in that case,
totally unprovoked assault.

11:40.199 --> 11:42.201
I used the creep's face like a volleyball

11:42.284 --> 11:44.870
against the john door
for at least five minutes.

11:44.954 --> 11:46.747
It was a real ugly scene.

11:47.623 --> 11:50.292
I'm just glad there wasn't anybody
in there to see it.

11:50.668 --> 11:52.712
That little shrimp won't sign
a complaint against me

11:52.795 --> 11:54.463
for a million bucks, Counselor.

11:55.339 --> 11:58.759
(scoffs) If he does,
he's fish food in the river

11:58.843 --> 12:00.177
by the end of the week.

12:02.012 --> 12:04.473
No complaint, no charges.

12:05.224 --> 12:07.893
I'm out of this stinkhole
by 4:00 at the latest.

12:09.186 --> 12:11.230
I imagine you will be, Mr. Crockett.

12:13.941 --> 12:16.736
-(horns honking)
-Whoa! Hit me! (shouting)

12:17.319 --> 12:19.363
Ooh! Hi-yah!

12:19.447 --> 12:21.782
(siren wailing)

12:24.326 --> 12:25.745
MAN: What do you think-- come on!

12:25.828 --> 12:28.080
(man laughs)

12:28.622 --> 12:29.623
Come on, hit me!

12:30.374 --> 12:32.084
(honking continues)

12:32.418 --> 12:33.461
TATAGLIA: He's got to be on dust.

12:33.544 --> 12:35.588
We went out there and he tried
to karate-kick my head.

12:35.671 --> 12:36.964
Do you think we should call
the paramedics?

12:37.047 --> 12:38.340
Oh, don't waste your time.

12:38.424 --> 12:40.176
They couldn't get a needle in him
with a blowgun out there.

12:40.259 --> 12:41.093
TATAGLIA: What are we gonna do?

12:41.177 --> 12:43.429
-He's gonna get run over any second.
-(shouting)

12:44.346 --> 12:47.767
Well, we could talk to him. All of us.

12:48.851 --> 12:50.436
(honking continues)

12:52.354 --> 12:54.148
COFFEY: So, Bruce Lee, how you doing?

12:54.690 --> 12:56.942
You got to be cold, uh,
standing out there like that.

12:57.026 --> 12:59.862
I'm telling the cars where to go, man.
(pants, chuckles)

12:59.945 --> 13:01.655
I'm telling the cars where to go!

13:01.739 --> 13:03.365
You don't have to tell me
where to tell the cars to go!

13:03.449 --> 13:05.701
Listen, there's no law
against telling the cars where to go.

13:06.076 --> 13:07.912
BATES: We just thought that maybe
you were freezing out there.

13:08.621 --> 13:09.872
You want my jacket?

13:09.955 --> 13:11.916
-I got it.
-Give it to me.

13:13.417 --> 13:14.627
I want it now!

13:14.710 --> 13:17.087
All right, look, if I give you
my coat now, you got to come with us.

13:19.632 --> 13:22.426
(screams)

13:22.510 --> 13:24.762
(grunting)

13:26.430 --> 13:29.225
-(grunting)
-(siren wailing)

13:37.483 --> 13:40.778
(grunting)

13:50.996 --> 13:52.706
Ah! Let go! I got to cuff!

13:52.790 --> 13:55.084
(grunting)

13:55.167 --> 13:56.085
All set!

13:56.627 --> 13:59.880
-(all grunting)
-(siren continue blaring)

14:13.143 --> 14:16.355
(siren wailing)

14:16.647 --> 14:18.315
I don't care if he ran a<i> purple </i>light.

14:18.399 --> 14:20.317
I'm about to bust a major organ here.

14:20.401 --> 14:22.194
I gave you 15 minutes
for a sit-down after roll call.

14:22.278 --> 14:25.906
Is it my fault that Jerkolech
was hogging that stall as per usual?

14:25.990 --> 14:27.783
-(tire screeching)
-Just make it fast!

14:29.118 --> 14:31.662
Oh. Oh, I'm dying here, Bobby.

14:31.745 --> 14:33.998
Just do the standard routine, okay?

14:34.498 --> 14:36.876
License, registration,
scribble a few notes,

14:36.959 --> 14:38.961
and<i> adios, </i>Mario. You got that?

14:39.920 --> 14:41.255
HILL: License and registration, please.

14:41.338 --> 14:42.923
Don't tell me, it's the socks, right?

14:43.257 --> 14:45.551
Blue socks, brown shoes,
I've offended you. (chuckles)

14:45.634 --> 14:47.595
No, wait, it's that, uh, family of 12

14:47.678 --> 14:49.263
that I rescued
from a burning bus last week

14:49.346 --> 14:50.639
and you want to give me a medal.

14:50.723 --> 14:52.016
Oh, please.

14:52.099 --> 14:53.267
HILL: Look, you ran a red light
back there, sir.

14:53.350 --> 14:55.603
Would you just give us
your license and registration, please.

14:55.686 --> 14:57.855
Oh, you mean a license? Yeah.

15:00.024 --> 15:00.900
(chuckles)

15:02.276 --> 15:03.235
Will a AAA card do?

15:04.361 --> 15:05.446
How about a AA card?

15:05.529 --> 15:08.198
Instead of a tow truck,
they send you a fifth of scotch. (laughs)

15:09.325 --> 15:10.576
MAN: What a morning
this turned out to be, huh?

15:11.243 --> 15:13.370
A guy comes up to me, says,
"You know where Delaware Park is?"

15:13.454 --> 15:15.873
I say, "No." He says,
"Okay, I'll mug you here." (laughs)

15:15.956 --> 15:18.334
He asked you for your license
and registration there, slick.

15:18.417 --> 15:19.668
MAN: Hey, relax, pal.

15:19.752 --> 15:24.506
It's (clears throat) probably in the,
uh, glove... compartment, the, uh--

15:31.180 --> 15:33.515
You've got several hundred dollars' worth
of parking tickets in there.

15:33.807 --> 15:35.809
Well, I'll be darned. (laughs)

15:36.685 --> 15:38.812
you can have the entire lot for 29.95.

15:39.188 --> 15:41.649
(sighs) Bobby, could we just please, uh--

15:41.732 --> 15:43.150
HILL: Would you mind
stepping out of the car?

15:43.233 --> 15:44.693
Op, what are you gonna do, shoot me,

15:44.777 --> 15:46.987
beat me to death with those rubber hoses?
Hmm... (chuckles)

15:47.571 --> 15:48.405
You don't look too good, pal.

15:48.489 --> 15:50.240
Look, we're gonna take you
down to the station.

15:50.324 --> 15:51.992
-Just step out of the car.
-Okay, okay.

15:52.076 --> 15:53.327
You know, lock me up. Persecute me.

15:53.410 --> 15:56.455
Put the nails right through the hands
and feed me to small animals.

15:56.538 --> 15:59.583
But remember this, I'm a personal friend
of Joey Bishop. (laughs)

16:00.793 --> 16:01.919
Wait right here.

16:02.378 --> 16:03.253
Belker.

16:05.589 --> 16:06.507
Move.

16:09.385 --> 16:10.344
BELKER: Left.

16:10.427 --> 16:13.681
I'm deathly ashamed, deathly ashamed.

16:13.764 --> 16:16.558
Oh, would you stop
all that old jive whining?

16:16.642 --> 16:18.769
-Sit down.
-If you hadn't of stopped like you did,

16:18.852 --> 16:20.270
we'd of outrun that white boy.

16:20.354 --> 16:23.107
Well, if you hadn't wasted time
rousing that pot roast,

16:23.190 --> 16:25.442
I wouldn't have had to stop
for the white boy.

16:25.734 --> 16:29.238
Well, who's been telling me
he'd rather go out in a blaze of gunfire

16:29.321 --> 16:30.447
than eat another plate of beans?

16:30.781 --> 16:32.157
Will you shut up?

16:35.577 --> 16:37.246
Name. You first.

16:37.329 --> 16:38.789
Freddie Lau-Jones,

16:38.872 --> 16:41.709
and I ain't never been outside
of the law in my life...

16:42.876 --> 16:45.421
except for the time
I borrowed some weekend money

16:45.504 --> 16:46.463
from the liquor store.

16:47.006 --> 16:49.008
And that was 38 long years ago.

16:50.384 --> 16:52.720
I been having myself
a clean slate ever since.

16:52.803 --> 16:54.138
That's the Lord's truth, son.

16:54.763 --> 16:55.764
Home address.

16:56.140 --> 16:58.225
We got us a room down on Dekker.

16:58.767 --> 17:01.145
There ain't no address
on account of they tore it down

17:01.228 --> 17:02.521
when they condemned the building.

17:02.604 --> 17:04.773
-(man screaming)
-FREDDIE: Ain't that right, Barney?

17:04.857 --> 17:06.358
MAN 2: I'm moving out on you, Freddie.

17:06.442 --> 17:09.236
This is the last time
I let you get me into any trouble.

17:09.737 --> 17:11.947
FREDDIE: Don't let the screen door hit
you on your way out.

17:12.614 --> 17:15.367
Hey, guys, I don't think you understand.

17:16.201 --> 17:17.786
You pulled an armed robbery.

17:17.995 --> 17:20.497
Even though the gun wasn't loaded,
you're probably going to jail.

17:21.040 --> 17:22.583
See what you done done?

17:23.083 --> 17:24.752
Lord, we're going to jail.

17:25.502 --> 17:28.672
Do jails have bathrooms
with hot running water nowadays?

17:28.756 --> 17:29.840
-(man continues screaming)
-Yeah, sure.

17:30.758 --> 17:32.760
Then we're better off than we've been.

17:33.510 --> 17:35.763
-FREDDIE: Do they have food in jail?
-Yeah.

17:36.555 --> 17:39.141
Well, Barney here,
he don't eat on Saturday,

17:39.433 --> 17:40.851
and I don't eat on Sunday.

17:41.143 --> 17:42.394
And that gets us through the week.

17:43.062 --> 17:44.396
They have doctors in jail?

17:44.646 --> 17:47.816
But Freddie here,
he's got diabetes and phlebitis,

17:47.900 --> 17:50.402
and he can't go back
to the hospital anymore

17:50.486 --> 17:52.696
'cause he done used up
all of his benefits.

17:53.030 --> 17:55.240
And Barney here, he's got a bad heart.

17:55.324 --> 17:57.451
Yeah, they say I have to have
a triple overpass,

17:57.951 --> 18:00.454
and I'm on the list
for one of those operations.

18:00.537 --> 18:03.207
What he needs is one of those
mechanical hearts.

18:03.582 --> 18:06.668
And it's a whole lot of white men
have to get one before he gets one.

18:07.044 --> 18:10.547
Freddie, I left my pills.
I thought we'd be home free by now.

18:10.631 --> 18:12.466
(man screaming)

18:12.549 --> 18:16.053
-(grunting)
-(broken glasses clattering)

18:16.637 --> 18:18.514
(grunting)

18:19.807 --> 18:21.809
(screaming continues)

18:21.892 --> 18:23.852
(growling)

18:23.936 --> 18:26.396
-(all grunting)
-BATES: Ow!

18:34.071 --> 18:35.781
-Get his feet. Get his feet.
-(man grunting)

18:35.864 --> 18:37.991
Take him downstairs.
We'll book him when he's straight.

18:38.075 --> 18:41.370
-(grunting, screaming)
-(grunts)

18:44.373 --> 18:46.166
Why did you do that, Mick?
Why did you hold me back?

18:46.250 --> 18:47.417
Because you could have gotten hurt.

18:47.501 --> 18:48.669
-So what?
-What happened to your face?

18:48.752 --> 18:50.462
I'm gonna get hurt. That's my job.

18:51.046 --> 18:52.881
Well, you're too little
for a psycho like that.

18:52.965 --> 18:54.716
I can look<i> you </i>in the eye, hotshot.

18:56.343 --> 18:58.637
You're right. I'm sorry.
I got a little carried away.

18:59.638 --> 19:02.933
You embarrass me, Mick.
Don't ever do it again.

19:03.016 --> 19:05.352
You better put some peroxide on that.
Those things--

19:10.065 --> 19:11.275
LARUE:<i> Bonjour.</i>

19:11.900 --> 19:14.236
Hi. Can I, uh, help you?

19:14.528 --> 19:17.239
Yeah. Could you tell us
where Sergeant Esterhaus is, please?

19:17.322 --> 19:20.784
Oh, uh, he's that tall,
elderly gentleman over there,

19:20.868 --> 19:23.453
but, uh, (clicks tongue) looks like
he might be a little busy, so--

19:23.537 --> 19:26.456
-Ah, the "belles" of St. Mary's!
-Sergeant Esterhaus?

19:26.540 --> 19:28.667
That's correct. And who might you be?

19:28.750 --> 19:30.711
-I'm Kristen.
-ESTERHAUS: Last name?

19:30.794 --> 19:31.837
-Murphy.
-ESTERHAUS: And you?

19:31.920 --> 19:35.757
Uh-uh. Cold showers,
babe, push-ups. (chuckles)

19:35.841 --> 19:36.758
It's criminal, Neal,

19:36.842 --> 19:39.428
Esterhaus monopolizing
all that young flesh.

19:39.511 --> 19:42.472
-(laughter)
-(indistinct chattering)

19:42.556 --> 19:44.349
What? No hostility, huh?

19:44.433 --> 19:46.018
Hey, I'm a dangerous man.

19:46.268 --> 19:49.188
-I tear tags off of mattresses.
-(laughter)

19:49.271 --> 19:51.773
All right, stand here, face this man,
and keep your mouth shut.

19:51.857 --> 19:52.983
Oh, you know what I did?

19:53.066 --> 19:54.818
I yelled "fire" at a urologists'
convention once.

19:54.902 --> 19:57.487
-That's dangerous.
-(laughter)

19:57.571 --> 19:59.031
You ever try a little humor in your work?

19:59.114 --> 20:00.657
You ever try paying your parking tickets?

20:00.741 --> 20:02.743
-Once. It cost me money.
-(laughter)

20:02.826 --> 20:04.453
All right, Sheckie's all yours, boy scout.

20:04.536 --> 20:05.996
I got a date with some porcelain.

20:06.288 --> 20:08.081
Angry wife goes to visit
her husband in the joint.

20:08.165 --> 20:09.708
"I'm fed up," she says.
"Look at your life.

20:09.791 --> 20:11.919
"Attempted robbery, attempted burglary,
attempted murder,

20:12.002 --> 20:12.920
can't you finish anything?"

20:13.003 --> 20:15.130
(laughter)

20:16.798 --> 20:18.091
This is my uncle, incredible man.

20:18.175 --> 20:20.219
A psychic, knew the exact day
he was gonna die.

20:20.427 --> 20:22.930
-The warden told him.
-(laughter)

20:23.972 --> 20:26.475
That's pretty good.
Hey, you're a pretty funny guy.

20:26.850 --> 20:27.809
A little old lady walks up
to a cop and says,

20:27.893 --> 20:29.102
"I was attacked. I was attacked."

20:29.186 --> 20:30.520
He says, "When?" She says, "20 years ago."

20:30.604 --> 20:31.813
He says, "Well, what are you
telling me now for?"

20:31.897 --> 20:34.524
She says, "Because I just like to talk
about it every once in a while."

20:34.608 --> 20:36.276
(laughter)

20:36.360 --> 20:37.778
Man, you're a scream.

20:37.861 --> 20:39.780
You know, you ought to be
doing this for a living.

20:40.739 --> 20:42.616
Thanks, Einstein.
I mean what do you think,

20:42.699 --> 20:44.576
I'm a member of the joint
chiefs of staff or something?

20:45.118 --> 20:46.578
I<i> do </i>do this for a living.

20:47.412 --> 20:50.290
Yeah? No kidding, huh?
A professional comic.

20:50.374 --> 20:52.000
Hey. Hey, you working
at a club around town?

20:52.084 --> 20:53.210
Maybe I can catch your act.

20:54.753 --> 20:57.464
Well, I'm, uh, you know, kind of
in between gigs right now. (chuckles)

20:57.756 --> 20:59.091
It takes a little time to get established,

20:59.174 --> 21:02.052
and since I just hit town
six months ago from Miami.

21:02.135 --> 21:04.179
You've been out of a gig for six months?

21:04.263 --> 21:05.555
A guy with your talent?

21:05.639 --> 21:08.558
(chuckles) Hey, it's the damn despotism
in this business, right?

21:09.017 --> 21:10.477
So you know. (chuckles)

21:10.560 --> 21:12.187
And am I right or am I right
not to mention agents?

21:12.271 --> 21:15.440
I mean, you sign with the wrong one,
next stop, toilet town.

21:15.524 --> 21:17.484
(laughter)

21:17.567 --> 21:20.070
My old lady, I took her
to a wife-swapping party last week.

21:20.153 --> 21:22.864
-I had to throw in some cash.
-(laughter)

21:23.657 --> 21:24.574
Name, sir?

21:25.492 --> 21:27.035
Vic. Public relations.

21:27.119 --> 21:28.578
I mean, I don't want to make
excuses or nothing,

21:28.662 --> 21:31.498
but how in the hell
am I supposed to land a gig

21:31.581 --> 21:32.833
wearing this clown suit?

21:32.916 --> 21:34.251
Uh, sorry. I need your full name.

21:34.334 --> 21:35.752
It's Vic, sweetheart, Vic.

21:35.836 --> 21:36.795
Yeah, I got that.

21:36.878 --> 21:41.091
...for any pants. I haven't had a decent
razor cut or manicure in two years.

21:41.842 --> 21:43.635
Should have caught my act in Reno, '72.

21:43.719 --> 21:45.971
-Man, did I look sharp.
-(laughter)

21:46.054 --> 21:48.640
Sir, I need your last name.

21:49.099 --> 21:50.726
It's Hitler. And then there's my car.

21:50.809 --> 21:52.060
I mean, that's a joke in itself
right there.

21:52.144 --> 21:53.270
-(groans)
-Hitler?

21:54.021 --> 21:56.023
Yeah, Vic Hitler.
Read my lips, Vic Hitler.

21:56.606 --> 21:58.692
I mean, you don't think
the guys that park the car

21:58.775 --> 22:01.987
don't tell the club owners that I drive
a 15-year-old Dodge? (chuckles)

22:02.821 --> 22:05.490
-Mm. Money chases money, right?
-Vic Hitler?

22:05.574 --> 22:08.535
That's my life story.
(laughs) That's it in a nutshell.

22:08.618 --> 22:13.582
Hey, hey, uh, you ever thought
of changing your name?

22:14.875 --> 22:17.127
-Why?
-(snickers)

22:21.256 --> 22:22.215
(door closes)

22:30.349 --> 22:31.850
Hey, Tatum, you sane yet?

22:32.768 --> 22:34.811
You tell me how sane I'm supposed to be

22:35.854 --> 22:38.732
after you guys beat me
every way but Sunday.

22:39.232 --> 22:42.027
Hey, pal, what do you call this, a rose?

22:43.570 --> 22:44.404
Put these on.

22:46.198 --> 22:48.617
You done bought yourself a lawsuit,
Jack. (chuckles)

22:50.077 --> 22:51.370
I got rights.

22:51.912 --> 22:53.038
You know, where I come from,

22:53.372 --> 22:55.165
we don't take
that kind of stuff off of him.

22:55.957 --> 22:57.501
Another county heard from.

22:58.210 --> 23:01.213
Where I come from
we'd have your turkey face for breakfast!

23:06.259 --> 23:07.969
I'm right here. Come on.

23:08.053 --> 23:10.680
-COFFEY: Hey, Harley, turn it off.
-Yeah, or what?

23:10.764 --> 23:13.975
You gonna sit on me, right, huh?
You gonna get on my case? (scoffs)

23:16.269 --> 23:17.854
White man ain't got no rights no more.

23:17.938 --> 23:19.815
Why don't you give it a rest, both of you?

23:26.029 --> 23:27.322
(door closes)

23:33.745 --> 23:36.915
If now is not the most
opportune time, amigo,

23:37.582 --> 23:39.418
this old ex-checker can wait a while.

23:39.835 --> 23:41.086
Thank you very much, Lieutenant,

23:41.169 --> 23:43.255
but I think I ought to pay you
while I still have it.

23:43.338 --> 23:45.090
(chuckles) I understand.

23:47.676 --> 23:49.719
How is the old-timer doin', Mick?

23:50.303 --> 23:51.513
-My father?
-Mm-hmm.

23:52.347 --> 23:54.015
Most of the time he ain't so good.

23:54.641 --> 23:56.893
Doctor says he's got Alzheimer's disease.

23:57.227 --> 23:59.020
Hmm. Is that a friend of the family?

23:59.563 --> 24:02.482
-Who?
-This Zeimer individual.

24:02.566 --> 24:05.986
No. Probably some guy
they just name diseases after.

24:06.278 --> 24:07.988
It's a sure thing, Neal.

24:08.488 --> 24:10.365
All the guy needs is some front money.

24:10.449 --> 24:13.118
Something for a suit.
A little something for some promotion.

24:13.201 --> 24:15.745
Maybe we take out one or two ads
in one of them Hollywood papers,

24:15.829 --> 24:17.164
and (claps) he's gone,

24:17.247 --> 24:19.583
Vegas, Atlantic City, Johnny Carson.

24:19.666 --> 24:23.170
Man, you saw him. He's got it all,
delivery, timing, instinct.

24:23.253 --> 24:24.421
Yeah, parking tickets.

24:24.504 --> 24:26.047
What's that got to do with anything?

24:26.131 --> 24:27.591
All artists got quirks.

24:27.674 --> 24:29.009
Mm. Do they have the name Hitler?

24:29.342 --> 24:33.346
Man, you can't see a stroke of genius
when it slaps you in the face.

24:34.055 --> 24:36.683
In the business
it's what's known as a "hook."

24:37.100 --> 24:38.977
Whoever heard of a comic
with the name Hitler?

24:39.060 --> 24:40.854
I think there's a reason for that, babe.

24:41.563 --> 24:44.858
Yeah, I got to admit I've been toying
with a minor name change,

24:46.026 --> 24:48.278
Vic Hitler, Jr.

24:48.904 --> 24:51.698
I'm telling you, Neal, Hitler is the best
thing that ever happened to us.

24:52.032 --> 24:53.992
J.D., you might as well
turn off the faucet, babe,

24:54.075 --> 24:56.244
'cause you ain't getting dollar
one out of this cop.

24:56.328 --> 24:58.622
Uh-uh-uh. Don't even bother
messing in the mouth.

24:58.705 --> 24:59.664
Two hundred.

24:59.748 --> 25:03.043
Two hundred inflation-ridden dollars
to help launch a career

25:03.126 --> 25:06.630
that'll land the both of us
in money city for life.

25:07.172 --> 25:08.632
You gonna pass up a chance like that?

25:08.715 --> 25:10.050
Mm-hmm, every time.

25:22.729 --> 25:25.148
I had a talk with departmental
maintenance this morning.

25:25.232 --> 25:27.192
We should get another furnace
in a couple of months.

25:27.567 --> 25:29.110
Great. Just in time for summer.

25:33.865 --> 25:34.741
How's your beef?

25:35.784 --> 25:36.910
Rosa makes it better.

25:38.703 --> 25:40.372
-How's your fish?
-Fine.

25:41.206 --> 25:42.123
A little too much butter.

25:43.542 --> 25:44.459
The veal's good.

25:45.085 --> 25:46.169
I almost got the veal.

25:48.004 --> 25:51.216
(breathes deeply) This is crazy.

25:52.175 --> 25:53.385
We've been here for half an hour.

25:53.468 --> 25:56.888
We've covered every subject
from furnaces to veal,

25:56.972 --> 25:59.266
except what we came here to talk about.

26:00.642 --> 26:02.102
Henry should go first.

26:02.769 --> 26:06.106
After all, it's his situation
that has changed, not mine.

26:06.398 --> 26:07.816
I'm stuck in the same hole.

26:07.899 --> 26:10.235
Great, Ray. Bleed all over the table.

26:10.694 --> 26:12.028
We're here because of you.

26:13.280 --> 26:14.447
What's the problem, Ray?

26:15.782 --> 26:16.700
It's just that--

26:17.742 --> 26:21.079
Damn it, Frank, I don't get
any respect from anyone.

26:22.038 --> 26:22.956
How can I?

26:23.623 --> 26:28.211
I spend the whole day saying,
"Phone call, Frank. Your car is ready."

26:29.713 --> 26:31.423
I feel useless.

26:32.299 --> 26:34.759
I feel like everyone
is moving up except me.

26:35.885 --> 26:38.221
I feel like I'm being left
behind by you, Frank,

26:38.305 --> 26:39.472
and it stinks.

26:40.390 --> 26:42.767
-Okay, now we're getting somewhere.
-(clears throat)

26:43.184 --> 26:45.854
Uh, would you mind putting out
that cigar, sir?

26:46.062 --> 26:47.397
This is the smoking section.

26:47.480 --> 26:49.232
It doesn't give you the right
to ruin my meal.

26:49.316 --> 26:51.234
-So call a cop.
-I<i> am </i>a cop.

26:51.318 --> 26:52.777
MAN: So, big deal, you're a cop.

26:52.861 --> 26:54.112
What are you gonna do,
send me up the river?

26:54.195 --> 26:56.448
I paid a buck for this cigar.
I want to enjoy it.

26:59.451 --> 27:00.368
Here.

27:01.411 --> 27:03.288
Hey, that's gonna cost you
more than a buck.

27:04.122 --> 27:06.166
This is a designated smoking area, sir.

27:06.333 --> 27:08.460
-I'd hate to have to ask you to leave.
-You don't have to.

27:13.965 --> 27:15.759
(horn honks)

27:20.764 --> 27:22.474
(tires screeching)

27:36.780 --> 27:38.031
I don't know what got into me.

27:38.573 --> 27:41.284
Ask me, I think
you were displacing anxiety.

27:42.077 --> 27:44.204
No psychoanalysis, Henry, okay?

27:44.954 --> 27:46.247
Right. You're right.

27:46.790 --> 27:48.500
Besides, we have other things
to talk about.

27:49.542 --> 27:51.002
(horn honks)

27:51.086 --> 27:52.962
(sighs)

27:53.046 --> 27:55.507
Provided we don't die of old age
getting to the point.

27:59.260 --> 28:00.220
I'm jealous.

28:00.929 --> 28:02.847
I'm jealous, I am ambitious,

28:03.473 --> 28:04.432
and I'm afraid.

28:04.808 --> 28:06.351
Welcome to the human race, Ray.

28:06.810 --> 28:09.104
I'm afraid you don't think
I'm good enough to be a captain.

28:09.562 --> 28:11.314
Have I given you any indication of that?

28:11.898 --> 28:15.652
Frank, my scores are high.
I am a hard worker.

28:15.735 --> 28:17.904
The department is ready
to promote Hispanics.

28:17.987 --> 28:19.280
I'm out of answers.

28:19.364 --> 28:21.324
So, I have to ask myself if it's you.

28:21.408 --> 28:23.618
I've recommended you for every vacancy.

28:23.702 --> 28:24.661
How strongly?

28:25.870 --> 28:27.288
Frank, be honest with me.

28:27.664 --> 28:29.624
Do you believe I have leadership ability?

28:30.959 --> 28:33.253
I think there's no better man
in the department,

28:33.336 --> 28:34.963
no more decent human being.

28:35.547 --> 28:38.133
I think you're a gifted
organizer and administrator.

28:38.508 --> 28:39.426
But?

28:40.385 --> 28:42.345
Do I see clear capacity for leadership?

28:42.429 --> 28:45.098
Sometimes. Sometimes not.

28:45.890 --> 28:47.308
(sighs) I see.

28:48.184 --> 28:51.271
You field 80 percent
of the precinct's business.

28:51.354 --> 28:54.858
You have a better flowchart in your head
than any duty officer's blackboard.

28:55.525 --> 28:56.943
I'm 48 years old.

28:58.528 --> 29:00.447
I have goals that I want to accomplish,

29:00.989 --> 29:04.242
ambitions that I set out with
when I was 20 years old.

29:04.701 --> 29:05.577
When I came here--

29:05.660 --> 29:08.246
And I appreciate that, Ray,
but you also have to keep in mind

29:08.329 --> 29:09.998
that even if you don't reach
all those goals,

29:10.081 --> 29:11.416
it doesn't make you less a person.

29:12.542 --> 29:14.169
So says the captain.

29:15.378 --> 29:16.337
You're right.

29:17.213 --> 29:18.423
It's easy for me to say.

29:23.845 --> 29:25.638
Thank you for your honesty, Frank.

29:26.389 --> 29:28.558
You've given me a lot to think about.

29:28.892 --> 29:32.437
Well, I hope you heard everything I said,
the good, as well.

29:33.188 --> 29:34.230
CALLETANO: I heard everything.

29:36.566 --> 29:38.777
(engine turns over)

29:39.360 --> 29:42.781
-(telephone ringing)
-(indistinct conversations)

29:44.616 --> 29:46.409
WOMAN: All right.
Just don't push, all right?

29:53.124 --> 29:57.879
Ladies, here in the vending area,
the officer takes sustenance

29:58.171 --> 29:59.923
when he hasn't time
for the full-dressed meal

30:00.006 --> 30:01.341
he might like to enjoy.

30:01.549 --> 30:02.967
Disgusting! How could I think that?

30:03.051 --> 30:04.636
-Get out of here, Vic.
-Did I die?

30:04.719 --> 30:07.138
I think I died and went
right to Heaven. (laughs)

30:08.014 --> 30:12.852
Hey, hey! I finally made it,

30:12.936 --> 30:15.522
<i>American Bandstand.</i>

30:15.605 --> 30:18.817
<i>♪ Da ra da dum-dum-dum ♪</i>

30:18.900 --> 30:21.194
<i>♪ Da da dum-dum-dum ♪</i>

30:21.277 --> 30:23.530
Hey, spotlight on Rico!

30:23.613 --> 30:26.908
Ladies, shall we leave
the area, please? Please.

30:26.991 --> 30:29.953
(humming)

30:39.003 --> 30:40.672
-Fay.
-Frank.

30:41.714 --> 30:42.549
How are you?

30:43.758 --> 30:44.592
Um...

31:00.775 --> 31:01.985
I'm pregnant, Frank.

31:04.070 --> 31:04.946
You sure?

31:07.198 --> 31:09.701
-Paul Grogin?
-Who else?

31:11.202 --> 31:13.413
-What are you gonna do?
-I don't know.

31:15.623 --> 31:17.709
You know how I feel
about abortion, and, uh...

31:18.543 --> 31:21.963
(inhales deeply)
I'm gonna be 39 years old, Frank.

31:22.255 --> 31:23.131
(sighs)

31:23.590 --> 31:26.050
I'm pregnant by a man
who won't even take the responsibility

31:26.134 --> 31:28.970
for returning my phone calls,
let alone supporting a child.

31:35.310 --> 31:38.229
You're always so logical, Frank.
Please be logical for me now.

31:38.813 --> 31:40.523
I can't tell you what to do, Fay.

31:41.441 --> 31:42.859
If you ask my opinion...

31:44.652 --> 31:46.821
I can't really see an upside to this.

31:47.655 --> 31:48.656
(sighs)

31:48.740 --> 31:51.492
I mean, your moral convictions
about abortion notwithstanding,

31:51.868 --> 31:54.829
you're already raising an eight-year-old
who's quite a handful.

31:55.622 --> 31:56.456
I know.

31:57.081 --> 31:58.917
You know my financial situation,

32:00.084 --> 32:02.170
your rent and Frank Jr.'s expenses.

32:03.254 --> 32:06.132
I guess you'd have to ask
the father for support.

32:06.215 --> 32:07.592
-(sighs)
-That might mean...

32:09.928 --> 32:12.680
-court appearances, testimony...
-I know.

32:12.764 --> 32:14.849
And there are possible
health considerations.

32:15.266 --> 32:16.476
I know, Frank.

32:19.896 --> 32:21.439
It's just that there's, uh...

32:22.649 --> 32:23.816
There's life in me.

32:25.610 --> 32:27.654
And I'm so moved, it's--

32:28.863 --> 32:30.823
it's as if Paul has nothing to do with it.

32:34.661 --> 32:36.788
-I know you think I'm a flake, Frank...
-Stop it.

32:37.830 --> 32:39.332
-...but I raised your son.
-Yes.

32:39.415 --> 32:41.292
I mean, is there anything about him
you'd have different?

32:41.376 --> 32:42.335
Nope.

32:46.881 --> 32:48.007
It's just that-- (sobs)

32:49.384 --> 32:51.844
I mean, I know everything
you say is true, but...

32:54.931 --> 32:56.975
...I have life in me.

32:58.559 --> 33:00.353
(sobbing)

33:05.984 --> 33:09.153
-You asked me what I think.
-(sniffles)

33:09.237 --> 33:11.990
Now, no matter how it is between us,

33:12.073 --> 33:13.324
we're still a family, you know.

33:14.033 --> 33:16.160
So no matter what you choose,
I'll still be there.

33:16.244 --> 33:17.537
I'll do whatever I can.

33:20.081 --> 33:21.457
I love you, Frank.

33:23.668 --> 33:26.337
I always have, and I always will.

33:33.845 --> 33:36.139
The guard level holding facility,

33:36.222 --> 33:39.183
a recently added
transitional accommodation

33:39.434 --> 33:43.229
for our precinct's alleged perpetrators.

33:44.605 --> 33:46.149
Here on the left,

33:47.066 --> 33:49.569
presently in the arms of Morpheus,

33:50.319 --> 33:53.448
is a gentleman arrested
in an acute delusional state,

33:53.531 --> 33:57.285
directly resulting from his ingestion
of dangerous drugs.

33:58.578 --> 34:01.497
Do you see anything glamorous
in that, ladies, hmm?

34:01.664 --> 34:03.291
Anything that looks like fun?

34:06.252 --> 34:07.462
Mr. Tatum!

34:12.300 --> 34:13.217
Hmm.

34:25.938 --> 34:27.398
You all right, young man?

34:30.568 --> 34:31.986
(gasps)

34:42.330 --> 34:45.541
You know, your holding cells are getting
like the firing range, Captain. (sighs)

34:45.792 --> 34:47.960
You people had the Dunleavy homicide
a while back.

34:48.044 --> 34:50.755
The last thing I need right now
is some smartass from I.A.D.

34:50.838 --> 34:53.007
taking cheap shots at this precinct.

34:53.091 --> 34:55.718
-Sorry.
-Save your "sorrys" and do your job.

34:57.178 --> 34:59.722
Is this area generally left,
uh, unsupervised?

34:59.806 --> 35:00.640
Read your manual.

35:00.723 --> 35:03.768
A khaki officer's down here
to check this facility every half-hour.

35:03.851 --> 35:04.977
According to my information,

35:05.061 --> 35:06.854
the last person down here
was Officer Coffey,

35:06.938 --> 35:08.189
who is not a khaki officer.

35:08.272 --> 35:10.608
I told you, I was bringing the guy
some clothes.

35:13.027 --> 35:14.779
Captain, I think you're gonna have
to put Officer Coffey

35:14.862 --> 35:16.614
on a desk pending disposition.

35:16.781 --> 35:18.908
I mean, my accounts have him
choking the man out at the bust

35:18.991 --> 35:20.868
and, uh, making a trip
to see him in his cell.

35:20.952 --> 35:21.869
-Captain--
-Is that it?

35:22.662 --> 35:25.748
For now... until we get forensics.

35:29.085 --> 35:31.462
I swear, Captain, I never touched the guy.

35:31.671 --> 35:33.297
I got a witness right in that cell.
He was right in that cell.

35:33.381 --> 35:35.133
He'll be questioned. Don't worry about it.

35:36.134 --> 35:37.677
-Yeah--
-It's procedure, Joe.

35:37.927 --> 35:39.512
It's just gonna be a couple days.

35:40.263 --> 35:41.556
I don't believe this!

35:42.557 --> 35:44.559
-Hiya, Frank.
-I'm dead.

35:44.642 --> 35:46.644
This guy's gonna convict me
of the Korean War.

35:46.811 --> 35:47.645
Wally.

35:47.728 --> 35:49.480
I understand one of your boys
choked a guy.

35:49.564 --> 35:51.232
That's speculative at best.

35:52.567 --> 35:53.776
Now, listen, Frank...

35:54.861 --> 35:55.945
I owe you one.

35:56.487 --> 35:58.030
You just tell me how you want it.

35:58.114 --> 36:01.659
I want it by the numbers, Coroner Nydorf.

36:02.702 --> 36:04.287
Uh-huh. Sure.

36:05.288 --> 36:06.414
I just, um--

36:07.248 --> 36:08.124
(chuckles)

36:08.916 --> 36:09.750
Of course.

36:11.335 --> 36:12.295
Let's see what we got.

36:24.307 --> 36:27.059
Now, either one of the brawls
could have killed Tatum, Frank,

36:27.143 --> 36:27.977
but I don't buy it.

36:28.060 --> 36:29.812
The time frame's all wrong.

36:30.229 --> 36:33.900
Some kind of physiological reaction
to the PCP could have done it,

36:33.983 --> 36:35.943
but, again, there's a time factor.

36:36.027 --> 36:37.153
Tatum was coming down.

36:37.236 --> 36:38.905
The drug was dissipated.

36:39.530 --> 36:42.283
No, whatever killed Lynn Tatum

36:42.366 --> 36:44.535
occurred while he was inside
the cell, Frank.

36:44.619 --> 36:45.953
I'm convinced of it.

36:46.746 --> 36:47.997
Now I got a theory,

36:48.748 --> 36:51.542
one that's not contradicted
by circumstances.

36:52.835 --> 36:54.212
Get in the cell, Frank.

36:54.712 --> 36:55.922
Just get in the cell.

36:57.924 --> 37:00.218
Now, come over here by the bars over here.

37:00.468 --> 37:01.427
Right over here.

37:01.886 --> 37:05.139
That's right. Now turn around like that.
That's good.

37:05.890 --> 37:08.059
Now, see?

37:08.601 --> 37:10.561
With my left arm like this, Frank,

37:10.645 --> 37:13.231
you'd never show bar burns
to the back of Tatum's head.

37:13.940 --> 37:14.815
Okay?

37:15.316 --> 37:17.902
Now, I let you go, and you fall.

37:18.945 --> 37:20.488
Uh, tell me what you think happened--

37:20.571 --> 37:22.990
Will you just fall, Frank?

37:26.452 --> 37:28.871
You see? You see where your
honker's heading, Frank?

37:28.955 --> 37:30.706
Right splat on the cement.

37:31.207 --> 37:32.792
You fall like that in a dead faint,

37:32.875 --> 37:35.878
you buy yourself a trauma
right up here on the bridge of the nose.

37:35.962 --> 37:39.757
Tatum had a collection of blood
up here, Frank, and it pooled.

37:39.840 --> 37:42.468
And there were bruise marks
on the frontal planes of the face.

37:42.551 --> 37:44.178
He-he must have been hit 30 times

37:44.262 --> 37:46.347
in the course of two major
struggles with officers.

37:46.430 --> 37:48.432
Surely he had to be hit in the nose.

37:48.516 --> 37:51.727
It's the time frame, Frank, the time.

37:52.019 --> 37:55.356
The way the blood clotted says
that he was lying motionless

37:55.439 --> 37:57.108
within minutes of the injury.

37:57.775 --> 38:00.361
So, he falls here,

38:01.320 --> 38:03.406
and then probably a few minutes later,

38:03.990 --> 38:08.536
in a half-conscious state consistent
with the tracheal damage observed,

38:09.704 --> 38:11.497
he stumbles over to his cot,

38:13.499 --> 38:15.376
where he fails to regain consciousness...

38:18.838 --> 38:21.549
and suffocates by reason
of a fractured larynx.

38:23.884 --> 38:26.679
He was subdued by a chokehold
during the initial arrest.

38:26.762 --> 38:28.097
Couldn't the injury have occurred then?

38:28.180 --> 38:30.057
(laughs)

38:30.141 --> 38:33.227
From what I hear, he was yelling
his lungs out for nearly an hour

38:33.311 --> 38:35.104
after they dragged him in here, Frank.

38:35.187 --> 38:37.440
With a fracture like that,
the vocal cords are shot

38:37.523 --> 38:39.108
in 15, 20 minutes.

38:39.317 --> 38:40.526
Find any blood on the floor?

38:40.818 --> 38:43.404
Patience, Frank. Patience.

38:43.946 --> 38:46.407
We'll be down here
with our tongues on the cement.

38:48.117 --> 38:51.746
-Couldn't Coffey--
-Yes, Coffey could have killed him,

38:52.204 --> 38:54.999
but it could have been the guy
in the next cell, Frank.

38:55.333 --> 38:58.336
Now, I took the liberty of asking
a couple of questions.

38:58.627 --> 38:59.503
And from what I hear,

38:59.587 --> 39:02.131
Lynn Tatum's neighbor
wasn't exactly an advocate

39:02.214 --> 39:04.425
of better relations among the races.

39:04.717 --> 39:06.594
The two guys had some words.

39:07.553 --> 39:11.432
So, to my mind,
given what you said about Coffey,

39:11.766 --> 39:14.769
I'd at least pick this guy up
and ask him a few questions.

39:14.852 --> 39:17.188
We're looking for him right now.
Thanks, Wally.

39:18.564 --> 39:19.440
Thank you.

39:22.360 --> 39:23.361
Hey, Frank...

39:25.154 --> 39:26.530
So, what do you think?

39:27.698 --> 39:29.700
Young Sherlock Holmes or what?

39:30.117 --> 39:32.203
(laughs)

39:35.456 --> 39:37.249
(grunts)

39:37.541 --> 39:40.544
Your Honor, my clients inform me
that they might be willing to do

39:40.628 --> 39:44.632
a certain amount of local time
in this matter, say till mid-May,

39:45.007 --> 39:46.926
if they could be assured
of being cellmates.

39:47.218 --> 39:50.971
Well, that's very generous of them
to set so few conditions, Mr. Mancuso.

39:51.472 --> 39:54.100
Council, please approach.
Detective, you as well.

39:58.062 --> 39:58.979
(sighs)

39:59.939 --> 40:02.566
Your Honor, the people are not unaware
of the age of the defendants,

40:02.650 --> 40:04.777
but this was an armed robbery with a gun.

40:04.860 --> 40:05.945
<i>Unloaded </i>gun.

40:06.987 --> 40:12.243
Detective, what's your impression
of these two old colts?

40:13.494 --> 40:15.830
Well, they seem to be nice
enough guys to me, Your Honor.

40:16.789 --> 40:19.458
They're a little short of dough
like a lot of people these days,

40:20.126 --> 40:23.045
and, uh, it's none of my business...

40:25.005 --> 40:27.883
but they're both sick.
One of them has diabetes.

40:28.259 --> 40:32.012
I'm aware of it, Detective.
It's on my papers here.

40:32.847 --> 40:36.892
Mr. Alvarez, I'm not about
to hand these men life sentences.

40:36.976 --> 40:39.562
(scoffs) We're talking
about 18 months max.

40:40.980 --> 40:43.566
With these guys, that is a life sentence.

40:44.900 --> 40:46.652
Your Honor,
if you're intending to dismiss,

40:46.735 --> 40:48.779
the people will have
to strenuously object.

40:49.196 --> 40:50.906
Well, be my guest, Mr. Alvarez,

40:50.990 --> 40:53.951
because that's exactly
what I'm going to do. Step back.

40:57.329 --> 41:02.918
Gentlemen, If you come back before me
again on a crime as heinous as this,

41:03.252 --> 41:06.046
I'll see that you get 12 years apiece

41:06.589 --> 41:08.090
in separate cells...

41:08.799 --> 41:10.092
in different prisons.

41:10.176 --> 41:13.137
You'll die 500 miles apart.

41:14.096 --> 41:15.473
Case is adjourned.

41:16.474 --> 41:17.808
-Contemplation of dismissal.
-(gavel bangs)

41:19.101 --> 41:19.935
Step out.

41:24.899 --> 41:26.192
Where do we get our stuff at?

41:26.275 --> 41:28.068
The property clerk, second floor.

41:28.152 --> 41:34.366
BAILIFF: Docket number's N637452-458.

41:34.450 --> 41:37.369
Vic-- (chuckles) Vic Hitler?

41:47.213 --> 41:48.088
How are you doin'?

41:49.048 --> 41:50.132
(sighs)

41:57.556 --> 42:02.645
I, uh, see your occupation
is comedian, Mr. Hitler.

42:03.729 --> 42:05.189
Bet you're a million laughs, huh?

42:06.190 --> 42:09.610
Your Honor...
Your Honor, Detective John LaRue,

42:10.027 --> 42:11.111
Hill Street Station.

42:11.862 --> 42:15.115
I, uh, just want to be
a character witness for Mr. Hitler.

42:19.161 --> 42:23.290
Hey, sonny, you know
they wouldn't give us our gun back?

42:23.499 --> 42:24.917
-Your gun?
-Yeah.

42:25.417 --> 42:27.336
What are you talking about, you hairball?

42:27.419 --> 42:30.005
You have any idea the kind of breaks
you guys got today?

42:30.422 --> 42:32.132
You got a revolving-door judge.

42:32.216 --> 42:33.259
You got a good word from me,

42:33.342 --> 42:35.511
and you got real, real lucky
when the guy in the supermarket

42:35.594 --> 42:37.263
didn't have a shotgun under the counter.

42:38.597 --> 42:41.016
You got to keep your noses clean,
do you hear me?

42:41.517 --> 42:44.395
Pull a stunt like this again and like
the judge said, you're going to jail.

42:44.478 --> 42:47.439
And if you go to jail,
you ain't gonna see each other anymore.

42:47.856 --> 42:48.983
Yeah, we know that.

42:50.526 --> 42:52.278
-You think we don't know that?
-Well, then?

42:53.821 --> 42:55.531
You can't make us beg, that's all.

42:56.532 --> 42:58.701
Won't do no more beggin',
neither one of us.

42:59.076 --> 43:01.161
Won't eat no more dog food neither.

43:02.204 --> 43:03.956
Too old to eat dog food.

43:06.041 --> 43:06.959
Come on, Freddie.

43:12.256 --> 43:15.426
Mr. Hitler, are you capable at this time

43:15.509 --> 43:18.637
of paying all or part of the money
you owe this state?

43:19.805 --> 43:20.848
Dream on, Your Honor.

43:22.016 --> 43:23.809
I'm so tapped that my banker
came to my apartment

43:23.892 --> 43:25.436
and demanded his calendar back. (chuckles)

43:25.519 --> 43:26.770
(laughs)

43:29.732 --> 43:30.566
Bailiff...

43:31.692 --> 43:34.445
Set a hearing date
for the purpose of constructing a schedule

43:34.528 --> 43:38.073
by which Mr. Hitler will be able
to meet his obligations.

43:39.408 --> 43:41.243
It isn't the intent of this court

43:41.327 --> 43:44.747
to prevent parking violators
from practicing their trade,

43:45.497 --> 43:47.166
regardless of their surnames.

43:47.791 --> 43:50.169
Your Honor, thank you
sincerely and deeply.

43:50.252 --> 43:53.339
You're a beautiful person,
like Detective LaRue here.

43:54.131 --> 43:55.299
I don't know if you like jokes,
Your Honor, but--

43:55.382 --> 43:58.385
-Yeah, uh, Vic--
-(chuckles) Yeah. You're right.

43:58.469 --> 43:59.303
-Come on.
-Is he--

43:59.803 --> 44:02.222
-This guy is the type of man...
-Neal.

44:02.306 --> 44:03.891
-No, that's true.
-LARUE: Come on.

44:03.974 --> 44:05.893
You're a beautiful person, Your Honor.
Thanks. You are.

44:06.435 --> 44:07.728
(indistinct conversations)

44:07.811 --> 44:08.729
You know what I'm gonna do?

44:09.688 --> 44:12.566
I have an uncle in the gravel business.
I'm gonna call him tomorrow.

44:14.401 --> 44:16.195
(chuckles) Hey, look,
we're gonna get the lawyer.

44:16.278 --> 44:17.613
Everything's gonna be fine.

44:19.865 --> 44:23.077
You know, whatever happened
down there in the cell,

44:23.160 --> 44:24.370
I mean, you can tell me if you want.

44:26.372 --> 44:29.541
Hey, I don't have a word to add,
not one word.

44:37.007 --> 44:39.176
Those two old guys were just-- (sighs)

44:41.720 --> 44:43.222
They weren't your father, Mick.

44:44.014 --> 44:44.973
I mean, your father's got you.

44:45.057 --> 44:46.934
Your father's got your mom
and your sister.

44:47.017 --> 44:48.018
It doesn't matter.

44:48.310 --> 44:49.728
You get old, people push you off.

44:49.812 --> 44:51.230
They put you in a home.

44:51.313 --> 44:53.857
-Come on.
-(sighs)

44:53.941 --> 44:56.235
Hey, you know something?
Let's go see your old man.

44:57.444 --> 44:58.445
When, right now?

44:58.529 --> 44:59.697
Yeah, sure. Why not?

45:00.364 --> 45:02.157
(chuckles) I was just there
this afternoon.

45:02.241 --> 45:04.618
Yeah, but we could go together.
I'd like to meet your father.

45:05.619 --> 45:07.329
-You would, really?
-Really?

45:08.038 --> 45:09.832
No, I really would. I'm not kidding.

45:12.459 --> 45:13.669
What about this morning?

45:14.044 --> 45:15.963
Ah, forget about it. It's history.

45:17.047 --> 45:18.465
We're in this thing together, Mick.

45:22.302 --> 45:23.303
Let's go.

45:25.305 --> 45:27.683
-(indistinct conversations)
-(laughter)

45:29.727 --> 45:31.645
Our table will be ready in a few minutes.

45:31.729 --> 45:33.021
Where's Clark? Did he go back?

45:33.856 --> 45:35.357
He's staying at the Marquee tonight.

45:36.066 --> 45:38.026
He's got some business in town tomorrow.

45:39.695 --> 45:41.572
-Um...
-He offered me the job.

45:44.408 --> 45:48.412
Could I have some water
with, uh, lemon in it?

45:51.623 --> 45:52.583
Can we sit over there?

46:07.431 --> 46:09.892
-Are you gonna take it?
-I haven't decided yet.

46:11.643 --> 46:12.561
(sighs)

46:14.313 --> 46:15.189
Thank you.

46:18.484 --> 46:21.987
Don't look at me like that,
like I'm some kind of criminal.

46:22.279 --> 46:23.447
It's not that easy, Frank.

46:24.072 --> 46:25.240
You're leaving my life.

46:25.824 --> 46:27.826
You keep saying that, but listen to me.

46:27.910 --> 46:31.789
Even if I take it, I'd...
I'd see you every weekend.

46:32.498 --> 46:34.458
Plus twice a month
I'd be here on business.

46:35.417 --> 46:38.378
Then maybe after 12, 18 months
I'd reassess.

46:38.754 --> 46:40.672
With a Justice Department
antitrust background,

46:40.756 --> 46:44.426
there'd be law firms in this town
offering me 70,000 to start.

46:47.262 --> 46:49.932
It would offer us
a whole different kind of security.

46:51.183 --> 46:52.100
Maybe.

46:52.559 --> 46:55.312
But somehow when I put
all those jokes together,

46:55.687 --> 46:57.022
it all comes out differently.

46:57.815 --> 46:59.983
You go down to Washington,
you work for Clark,

47:01.026 --> 47:02.611
suddenly you realize
what's really on his mind.

47:02.694 --> 47:06.323
He's in love with you.
He's rich and unencumbered.

47:06.406 --> 47:08.492
Well, we don't just
have to talk about Clark.

47:08.867 --> 47:12.913
Uh, Washington's filled with exciting men,
exciting jobs.

47:13.372 --> 47:14.957
Come home a couple of weekends,

47:15.415 --> 47:20.003
and here's good, old Frank Furillo
in a slightly shiny suit.

47:21.255 --> 47:23.215
You don't wear shiny suits, Frank.

47:23.966 --> 47:26.176
-Did you tell him you have a boyfriend?
-(sighing) Yes.

47:27.511 --> 47:29.888
Did you say, "he's a cop,"
or "he works in law enforcement"?

47:31.473 --> 47:33.725
-Frank, you're being very mean right now.
-No, I'm not.

47:33.809 --> 47:37.312
I'm just refusing to bury my head
in the sand.

47:37.563 --> 47:40.482
I won't lie to you.
Everything you say could happen.

47:40.858 --> 47:42.359
Maybe it would be the end of us.

47:42.693 --> 47:44.361
But let me give you another scenario.

47:46.280 --> 47:48.866
You bully me into turning down this job,

47:50.701 --> 47:52.536
and then I resent you for it forever.

47:53.787 --> 47:56.039
I'll love you no matter
what you decide, Joyce,

47:56.123 --> 47:58.500
but what you're saying is I can't win.

48:00.168 --> 48:03.463
Would you mind very much
if we were apart tonight?

48:04.464 --> 48:06.300
I have to give Clark a decision.

48:06.717 --> 48:07.885
There's just so much, Frank.

48:07.968 --> 48:10.596
I-I want to go home, take a bath,
wrestle with it.

48:11.555 --> 48:12.514
Wrestle alone?

48:33.577 --> 48:35.996
(closing theme playing)
