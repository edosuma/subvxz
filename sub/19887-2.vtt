WEBVTT

00:14.239 --> 00:17.319
Hail Mary, full of grace

00:19.720 --> 00:21.720
The Lord is with thee

00:23.839 --> 00:26.239
Blessed art thou among women

00:28.439 --> 00:31.119
And blessed is the fruit of thy womb,

00:32.119 --> 00:33.639
Jesus.

00:46.720 --> 00:49.360
Holy Mary, Mother of God

00:52.600 --> 00:54.119
Pray for us sinners

00:56.519 --> 00:59.639
Now and at the hour of our death

01:30.639 --> 01:32.439
Hey! Here, boy.

02:39.000 --> 02:42.560
Unidentified male. Dog
walker found him in the water.

02:42.600 --> 02:44.680
- Is that him?
- Yeah.

02:44.720 --> 02:46.360
SOCOs hauled the body out.

02:56.400 --> 02:59.400
- So what can you tell us, Tony?
- Late 20s.

02:59.439 --> 03:00.879
Emaciated.

03:00.920 --> 03:02.639
Signs of possible malnutrition.

03:02.680 --> 03:04.479
How long's he been dead?

03:04.519 --> 03:08.800
There's some post-mortem staining,
so, a few hours, I'd say.

03:08.839 --> 03:11.879
So, some time last night. Drowned?

03:11.920 --> 03:15.360
Unlikely. We've got a blunt trauma
wound to the back of the head.

03:15.400 --> 03:17.000
A shiner, a cut lip.

03:17.039 --> 03:20.039
What are those marks on his
arms? Are they needle tracks?

03:20.079 --> 03:23.319
We found this in his trouser pocket.

03:24.400 --> 03:26.800
Heroin wrap with a dealer's stamp.

03:26.839 --> 03:30.119
What's that say? "Dark Angel."

03:31.639 --> 03:33.839
Dealers like to stamp their gear.

03:33.879 --> 03:36.639
Users know they're
getting quality product.

03:36.680 --> 03:39.759
Well, if it's quality heroin,
that makes it OK, does it?

03:39.800 --> 03:42.639
Put a call in to Vice,
see what they can tell us.

03:44.200 --> 03:46.119
What's on the end of that chain?

03:54.759 --> 03:56.879
That's a mourning ring.

03:58.079 --> 04:00.079
Worn to remember the dead.

04:04.159 --> 04:06.839
Right, well, I want a sweep
of this whole riverbank --

04:06.879 --> 04:09.560
footprints, drag marks, the lot.

04:09.600 --> 04:11.839
I'm gonna talk to that
fella who found him.

04:11.879 --> 04:14.239
Can you give us a hand up, love?

04:17.720 --> 04:21.439
I'm DCI Stanhope, I'm
heading the investigation.

04:21.479 --> 04:24.200
Oh, I've already given
your copper a statement.

04:24.239 --> 04:25.720
I won't keep you long, love.

04:25.759 --> 04:28.000
You were out with your dog
when you found the lad?

04:28.039 --> 04:30.000
Yeah, floating face down in the burn.

04:30.039 --> 04:31.479
Have you seen him before?

04:32.479 --> 04:35.560
Doubt he was local. He
doesn't look the type.

04:35.600 --> 04:38.439
Did you see anyone else
on the path, in the woods?

04:38.479 --> 04:41.000
No one about, not at that hour.

04:41.039 --> 04:42.639
Ma'am.

04:42.680 --> 04:46.000
So, can you give your address
to one of my officers?

04:46.039 --> 04:47.680
And they'll make sure you get home.

04:47.720 --> 04:49.920
I'd rather walk, clear my head.

04:49.959 --> 04:51.519
Aye, I know how you feel.

04:55.119 --> 04:57.400
I've got intel on the heroin wrap.

04:57.439 --> 05:00.280
It's a brand that's been flooding
the streets in Gateshead.

05:00.319 --> 05:02.360
Pretty potent stuff, by all accounts.

05:02.400 --> 05:03.959
Oh, he's a city lad?

05:05.159 --> 05:07.200
What's he doing all the way out here?

05:07.239 --> 05:09.479
There's a needle exchange
on Altworth Road.

05:09.519 --> 05:12.239
We should check it out,
see if someone knows him.

05:19.800 --> 05:21.920
Yes, I do know him.

05:21.959 --> 05:23.360
There you go.

05:26.000 --> 05:28.400
His name's Nathan. He
came in twice a week.

05:28.439 --> 05:31.239
- How well do you know him?
- He's a troubled soul.

05:31.280 --> 05:33.159
Troubled? How?

05:33.200 --> 05:35.319
Well, he had a rough time of things.

05:35.360 --> 05:38.680
A lot of these kids, well, they
struggle just to stay on their feet.

05:38.720 --> 05:41.119
We found his body in a
woodland up in Alnwick.

05:41.159 --> 05:44.400
I don't know why he'd be up there.
Nathan was a creature of habit,

05:44.439 --> 05:46.560
never strayed far from
his patch, you know.

05:46.600 --> 05:48.319
Do you think he was homeless?

05:48.360 --> 05:50.400
I'd set him up the odd night in a hostel,

05:50.439 --> 05:53.159
but they shelter you
long-term if you're clean.

05:54.239 --> 05:56.759
- When did you last see him?
- He came in two days ago.

05:56.800 --> 05:59.079
Was he registered with
the exchange programme?

05:59.119 --> 06:02.759
We don't ask for personal details. I
couldn't even tell you his surname.

06:03.639 --> 06:05.159
What about his friends?

06:05.200 --> 06:06.759
No one I can think of.

06:06.800 --> 06:09.800
- Well, someone must be missing him.
- Oh, hang on, hang on.

06:10.680 --> 06:13.159
There was a girl he sometimes
knocked around with.

06:13.200 --> 06:14.959
I think she called herself Kelly.

06:15.000 --> 06:17.400
Kelly? Another user?

06:17.439 --> 06:21.479
I'm pretty sure she enrolled
on the methadone programme.

06:21.519 --> 06:24.839
- Pharmacy would need an address.
- I'll talk to them.

06:26.519 --> 06:29.280
If you do manage to track
down his next of kin,

06:29.319 --> 06:30.879
perhaps I could pay them a visit?

06:30.920 --> 06:33.239
You know, some small solace.

06:33.280 --> 06:34.879
I'll keep you informed.

06:34.920 --> 06:37.800
Thanks for your time, Father.

06:37.839 --> 06:39.239
Excuse me, love.

06:45.479 --> 06:48.959
So, he definitely died
from the blow to the head.

06:49.000 --> 06:50.400
Fractured skull.

06:50.439 --> 06:51.639
Internal bleeding.

06:52.600 --> 06:54.759
Yeah, he was hit from
behind with some force.

06:54.800 --> 06:56.720
Blood tests?

06:56.759 --> 06:59.319
There were traces of opiates
in his blood and urine.

06:59.360 --> 07:00.479
IV injection.

07:00.519 --> 07:02.920
So, yes, he had been using last night.

07:02.959 --> 07:07.360
- I've taken swabs for a DNA profile.
- Anything I can work with meantime?

07:07.400 --> 07:10.239
The bruising to his ribs
and this shiner on his eye,

07:10.280 --> 07:12.039
both consistent with some kind of assault.

07:12.079 --> 07:14.159
Does suggest he might
have known his killer.

07:14.200 --> 07:17.119
I'm gonna leave that little
puzzle for you to solve.

07:19.400 --> 07:22.400
Violent struggle, puts up a fight...

07:23.680 --> 07:25.519
.. comes off second best.

08:02.400 --> 08:05.039
We're here about a friend of yours.

08:06.479 --> 08:09.000
A regular down at the needle exchange.

08:09.039 --> 08:10.879
We know his name is Nathan.

08:12.560 --> 08:13.959
I've seen him around.

08:14.000 --> 08:15.720
Wouldn't say we were friends.

08:18.159 --> 08:20.000
Has something happened?

08:20.039 --> 08:23.280
I'm afraid he was found
murdered last night, love.

08:23.319 --> 08:24.839
Poor fella.

08:26.600 --> 08:28.920
So when did you last run into Nathan?

08:30.119 --> 08:31.959
Must have been a few days ago.

08:32.000 --> 08:34.920
Didn't see him on Tuesday, when
you picked up your methadone?

08:34.959 --> 08:37.079
I didn't get to the
centre at all this week.

08:37.119 --> 08:39.720
Picked it up from a chemist in town.

08:39.759 --> 08:41.680
We found this in Nathan's pocket.

08:41.720 --> 08:44.639
Do you know who he might
have scored that off?

08:45.639 --> 08:47.560
Could be any of the dealers in Newcastle.

08:47.600 --> 08:51.560
Now, Father O'Brien, he
told us Nathan was homeless.

08:52.720 --> 08:54.680
Well, if that's what he told you.

08:54.720 --> 08:57.639
What about his family?
He never mention anyone?

08:58.759 --> 09:01.319
We just need to give them the news, pet.

09:03.159 --> 09:05.560
I think his surname was Weaver.

09:05.600 --> 09:09.519
I know he didn't get on with his mam.
Grew up in one of those mining towns,

09:09.560 --> 09:11.280
somewhere like Ellington.

09:11.319 --> 09:14.239
Right, well, that's something
to be going on with.

09:14.280 --> 09:16.000
Well, if there's nothing else...

09:16.039 --> 09:18.159
Are you expecting company?

09:18.200 --> 09:20.720
- What if I am?
- Nothing, no.

09:21.720 --> 09:23.239
This your own place, is it?

09:23.280 --> 09:25.959
- That's right.
- Nice view!

09:27.519 --> 09:29.479
Where were you last evening?

09:30.479 --> 09:33.479
- I was here all night.
- Verify that, can you?

09:33.519 --> 09:36.560
Well, short of phoning up a client
for a character reference...

09:41.200 --> 09:42.920
Look, I'm sorry he's dead.

09:42.959 --> 09:45.200
Really, I am.

09:46.600 --> 09:48.600
But there's nothing I can tell you.

09:50.119 --> 09:53.159
Right, well, we'll leave
you to it. Thanks.

09:53.200 --> 09:57.400
If anything does spring
to mind, ask for CID.

10:04.319 --> 10:07.280
Business must be good,
plush pad on the river.

10:07.319 --> 10:08.879
The place doesn't look lived in.

10:08.920 --> 10:10.680
You reckon she's hiding something?

10:10.720 --> 10:12.839
She was frightened, I know that much.

10:14.600 --> 10:18.319
I tell you what, let's apply
for a surveillance order.

10:18.360 --> 10:22.319
And get on to the Land Registry,
find out who really owns that flat.

10:24.800 --> 10:25.959
Nathan Weaver.

10:26.000 --> 10:29.360
Late 20s, victim of a violent assault.

10:29.400 --> 10:34.280
His body was found by a dog walker,
Jeb Branning, in Brunhill Woods.

10:34.319 --> 10:36.519
He's thought to have been
dead about six hours,

10:36.560 --> 10:40.360
so killed late last night,
early hours of this morning.

10:40.400 --> 10:42.639
Heroin addict, possibly homeless.

10:42.680 --> 10:45.119
He was seen by a witness two days ago.

10:45.159 --> 10:47.000
Needle exchange, Gateshead.

10:47.039 --> 10:50.759
- A Father O'Brien.
- Who told us the lad was troubled.

10:50.800 --> 10:54.720
I've got a witness statement here
from a regular at the exchange.

10:54.759 --> 10:57.159
She claims that Nathan Weaver was dealing.

10:57.200 --> 10:59.400
Well, the chances are,
this is drug related.

10:59.439 --> 11:03.839
So, who was he working for
and who might he have crossed?

11:03.879 --> 11:07.439
Kenny, have you got anything on
the stamp on this heroin wrap?

11:07.479 --> 11:09.039
No one seems to recognise it.

11:09.079 --> 11:11.319
But they're hardly gonna
shop their suppliers.

11:11.360 --> 11:13.159
- Aye. - We've ran checks on his prints.

11:13.200 --> 11:14.319
No record.

11:14.360 --> 11:16.639
- Missing Persons?
- Nothing on the database.

11:16.680 --> 11:19.479
We could issue a public appeal.
It might throw something up.

11:19.519 --> 11:22.360
Aye. There's nothing to be
gained by keeping this quiet.

11:22.400 --> 11:24.879
And what about this
ring, what have we got?

11:24.920 --> 11:28.720
Antique. 18-carat gold.
-- Worth a bit, then.

11:28.759 --> 11:32.639
There's an inscription.
"Veritas me dirigit".

11:33.639 --> 11:35.800
Latin, that is, Kenny.

11:35.839 --> 11:37.639
"Let the truth guide me".

11:37.680 --> 11:38.800
Ooh!

11:38.839 --> 11:40.159
Stone me!

11:40.200 --> 11:42.879
Why hadn't he sold it?
He had a habit to finance.

11:42.920 --> 11:45.360
Ah, now, that's my thinking exactly.

11:45.400 --> 11:47.759
So run a check on the NMPR,

11:47.800 --> 11:51.239
any recent burglaries, pilfered jewellery.

11:51.280 --> 11:54.039
And what do we know about
this friend, Kelly Horton?

11:54.079 --> 11:57.839
She has an online profile
with an escort agency.

11:57.879 --> 12:01.759
It's how every self-respecting
client books a girl these days.

12:01.800 --> 12:04.439
Well, I'll take your word for that, Kenny.

12:07.280 --> 12:11.479
- Available for in-calls
only, ma'am. - Right.

12:11.519 --> 12:13.920
Have you got any plans
for tonight, Hicham?

12:15.439 --> 12:17.839
Football practice, pizza
and a pint with the lads.

12:17.879 --> 12:22.959
Nah. Well, get yourself a takeaway, love,
because I want a watch on that flat.

13:18.519 --> 13:19.920
Got you.

13:26.079 --> 13:28.079
Have you got a licence for that?

13:37.759 --> 13:39.159
Mrs Weaver?

13:42.560 --> 13:45.839
- Oh! - We're here
about your son, Nathan.

13:45.879 --> 13:47.280
What's he done?

13:48.039 --> 13:49.839
You might wanna sit down, love.

13:53.079 --> 13:54.400
God!

14:02.119 --> 14:04.119
When did you last see Nathan?

14:04.159 --> 14:06.519
He came round about three weeks ago.

14:07.519 --> 14:10.119
First time I'd clapped
eyes on him in months.

14:10.159 --> 14:12.079
How long has he been...?

14:12.119 --> 14:13.360
What, an addict?

14:13.400 --> 14:15.600
Since he was 17.

14:15.639 --> 14:18.360
Around the time his dad walked out on us.

14:18.400 --> 14:21.519
Well, that must have been hard
to deal with, all on your own.

14:21.560 --> 14:22.680
It was!

14:22.720 --> 14:25.439
Especially when he
started stealing from me.

14:26.119 --> 14:31.159
Strange thing was that the last
time I saw him, he looked better.

14:32.879 --> 14:35.079
He even talked about applying for a job.

14:35.119 --> 14:36.519
Did he tell you where?

14:37.519 --> 14:39.039
Somewhere in town.

14:39.079 --> 14:40.519
On the factory floor.

14:41.720 --> 14:43.560
And then he asked for a loan.

14:44.560 --> 14:46.439
Didn't say what the money was for?

14:47.680 --> 14:49.680
He said he owed some people.

14:50.680 --> 14:52.639
Same old story.

14:54.759 --> 14:56.639
Did this belong to you, love?

14:58.879 --> 15:00.600
I've never seen it before.

15:01.839 --> 15:04.839
Nathan was wearing it when we found him.

15:05.879 --> 15:08.159
Probably nicked it off someone.

15:11.000 --> 15:12.200
DS Healy.

15:13.400 --> 15:16.119
This photo, love, can we borrow it?

15:21.879 --> 15:24.159
"No one can help me, Mam."

15:24.200 --> 15:25.680
That's what he said.

15:29.159 --> 15:31.159
Maybe if I'd have let him come home.

15:32.439 --> 15:34.720
It's not your fault, love.

15:44.200 --> 15:47.600
The driver that picked up Kelly
last night, Hicham ran his plates.

15:47.639 --> 15:50.439
And? Get that circulated.

15:50.479 --> 15:53.200
It's registered to an Adam Gascoigne.

15:53.239 --> 15:55.439
Just finished a five-year stretch.

15:55.479 --> 15:58.200
Drug offences and violent
affray. Here he is.

16:01.200 --> 16:04.879
Well, that might explain why
none of the users are talking.

16:04.920 --> 16:07.280
He runs a salvage yard over in Blaydon.

16:07.319 --> 16:10.479
Right, let's pay him a little visit.

16:23.920 --> 16:25.720
Are you sure you wanna park there?

16:25.759 --> 16:27.200
Very funny!

16:36.839 --> 16:38.079
Adam Gascoigne?

16:38.119 --> 16:41.920
DCI Vera Stanhope,
Northumberland and City Police.

16:41.959 --> 16:44.759
We're investigating a homicide.

16:44.800 --> 16:48.039
- What's that got to do with us?
- Didn't say it had, love.

16:49.360 --> 16:50.680
Do you recognise this man?

16:50.720 --> 16:53.439
- Should I?
- Name of Nathan Weaver.

16:53.479 --> 16:55.680
Victim of a violent assault.

16:55.720 --> 16:58.560
I'm six months into a Prevention Order.

16:58.600 --> 17:01.000
Do you think I'd get mixed
up in something like that?

17:01.039 --> 17:05.400
- We know he was dealing drugs.
- Asking for trouble, then, wasn't he?

17:07.079 --> 17:12.000
We also know you've got previous,
possession with intent to supply.

17:13.200 --> 17:14.920
I've put all that behind me.

17:16.439 --> 17:21.159
You picked up a woman in this vehicle
last night, didn't you? Kelly Horton.

17:22.159 --> 17:24.439
- She needed a lift.
- To one of your clients?

17:24.479 --> 17:26.119
That's my business.

17:26.159 --> 17:28.839
Where were you Wednesday evening?

17:28.879 --> 17:33.879
Billiards club on the Durham Road.
Amateur tournament, came third.

17:33.920 --> 17:36.519
- Didn't get home till 4:00am.
- Well, we can check.

17:36.560 --> 17:39.879
You do that. Save you wasting my time.

17:41.519 --> 17:43.400
We're done here.

18:07.119 --> 18:10.519
Get Hicham down to that billiards
club, see if his alibi holds up.

18:10.560 --> 18:12.720
We've got nothing to pin
him to Nathan Weaver.

18:12.759 --> 18:16.079
He's a violent thug with form for
drugs, that'll do for starters.

18:16.119 --> 18:18.400
That flat on the river...

18:18.439 --> 18:22.720
is owned by a lettings company,
Mayfield Residential and Commercial.

18:22.759 --> 18:24.600
So Kelly was lying.

18:24.639 --> 18:26.959
Landlord's name's Stuart Mayfield.

18:27.000 --> 18:28.639
But he's not at work till Monday.

18:28.680 --> 18:30.680
Well, let's go and see him at home.

18:32.239 --> 18:34.039
Biscuit would have been nice.

18:49.959 --> 18:53.200
We had a couple of complaints
from one of the neighbours.

18:53.239 --> 18:55.039
Noisy visitors late at night.

18:56.239 --> 18:58.439
Aside from that, she's
never been any trouble.

18:58.479 --> 19:01.039
- She always pays the rent on time.
- How does she pay you?

19:01.079 --> 19:03.560
Direct debit, I think. 1st of every month.

19:03.600 --> 19:05.200
Ever see this man at the flat?

19:07.280 --> 19:10.560
I don't get over that way too often.
Haven't been round there in months.

19:10.600 --> 19:13.039
- Stuart?
- I'll be right over, love.

19:13.079 --> 19:15.159
Oh, it's a bit of a turnout.

19:15.200 --> 19:17.680
Just a few of the neighbours.

19:19.839 --> 19:22.159
If I'd known she was working from home...

19:23.079 --> 19:26.759
Maybe we can keep this between us. It
wouldn't look too good for business.

19:26.800 --> 19:29.439
Oh, I can't guarantee
that, sir, I'm afraid.

19:29.479 --> 19:31.479
I'll make sure I take care of things.

19:35.800 --> 19:37.759
We've just gone and got her evicted.

19:37.800 --> 19:42.319
Yeah, well, I had to tell him something.
All he cares about is his reputation.

19:45.079 --> 19:49.000
And do a run on his plates. Might
as well cover all our bases.

19:49.039 --> 19:50.159
Mark.

19:50.200 --> 19:52.400
I've pulled out Nathan
Weaver's bank statements.

19:52.439 --> 19:56.200
- Not quite down and out.
- His current account was barely used,

19:56.239 --> 19:59.519
but there is a recent deposit,
dated five days before he died.

19:59.560 --> 20:02.879
Bennick's Convenience Food.
It's a factory over in Pelaw.

20:02.920 --> 20:04.439
Thanks, Mark.

20:05.639 --> 20:09.839
What did his mam say? Went for
a job on the factory floor?

20:32.000 --> 20:35.560
We've reason to believe Nathan
Weaver had been working here.

20:35.600 --> 20:37.839
Aye, we took him on. We
were looking for packers.

20:37.879 --> 20:40.519
- He barely lasted a week.
- Why was that?

20:40.560 --> 20:43.920
The foreman gave him his marching
orders. You'll need to talk to him.

20:43.959 --> 20:46.560
Oi, Joe, a minute.

20:46.600 --> 20:49.759
Nathan Weaver, that lad
you got shot of last week.

20:49.800 --> 20:52.639
Ah, yeah. He'd had a few
warnings for turning up late,

20:52.680 --> 20:54.200
I didn't need the aggravation.

20:54.239 --> 20:56.879
We've got standards here at
Bennick's. Quality product.

20:56.920 --> 20:58.239
Oh, aye!

20:59.079 --> 21:01.280
Gave him plenty of chances
to sort himself out.

21:01.319 --> 21:03.079
Even paid him up to the end of the week.

21:03.119 --> 21:05.680
But between you and me, I
think he was on something.

21:05.720 --> 21:07.839
He looked like he needed a good wash.

21:08.720 --> 21:11.039
Did he make friends with
any of the other packers?

21:11.079 --> 21:13.079
Nah. Nah, he wasn't here long enough.

21:14.239 --> 21:16.400
What's he supposed to have done?

21:16.439 --> 21:18.439
I'm afraid he's been murdered, love.

21:19.519 --> 21:21.479
Sorry to hear that.

21:21.519 --> 21:24.680
Is it all right if my
sergeant has an ask around?

21:24.720 --> 21:26.239
Be my guest.

21:26.280 --> 21:29.920
- And you must have some details.
- We should have his home address.

21:29.959 --> 21:32.560
- Joe.
- Aye, it'll be in the office.

21:32.600 --> 21:34.159
Just come round.

21:44.879 --> 21:47.560
So much for being homeless.

21:47.600 --> 21:49.639
For a job, might have put
down any old address.

21:49.680 --> 21:51.319
A bit out of the way, though.

21:52.360 --> 21:56.000
He's keeping his head down,
if someone's out to get him.

22:05.839 --> 22:07.479
There's someone in there.

22:08.159 --> 22:09.879
Police. Open up, please!

22:26.680 --> 22:28.720
I let him stay here sometimes.

22:28.759 --> 22:30.439
He had nowhere else to go.

22:30.479 --> 22:32.319
So why lie to us?

22:32.360 --> 22:36.439
I open the door to a couple of coppers,
you tell me Nathan's been murdered,

22:36.479 --> 22:37.759
I wasn't thinking straight.

22:37.800 --> 22:39.560
Well, now you've had a bit of time,

22:39.600 --> 22:42.920
perhaps you'd like to think about
giving us some straight answers.

22:42.959 --> 22:44.680
Mam!

22:49.639 --> 22:51.439
It's all right, sweetheart.

22:51.479 --> 22:53.119
We're just talking.

22:57.800 --> 23:00.479
Nathan's stuff's in the bedroom upstairs.

23:07.759 --> 23:09.920
How long have the two
of you been together?

23:09.959 --> 23:12.000
We weren't. Not really.

23:12.039 --> 23:13.479
We met at the centre.

23:13.519 --> 23:15.439
It must have been five years ago.

23:16.239 --> 23:17.519
Fell in with each other.

23:17.560 --> 23:19.680
Suppose it was easier
than being on my own.

23:19.720 --> 23:23.800
So, the bairn... Nathan's?

23:25.959 --> 23:27.920
I'm still trying to take it all in.

23:29.079 --> 23:31.839
The meth, it numbs you, shuts you down.

23:32.839 --> 23:35.600
- None of this seems real.
- What's the lad's name?

23:35.639 --> 23:36.759
Kyle.

23:36.800 --> 23:39.239
So who looks after Kyle
when you're working?

23:39.280 --> 23:41.519
Child minder. Lives round the corner.

23:42.519 --> 23:44.039
I'm a good mum.

23:44.079 --> 23:47.239
And I'm trying to find
out who killed his dad.

23:48.239 --> 23:52.800
So if there's anything you can tell me
that might shed some light on that, pet...

24:31.600 --> 24:35.479
He tapped me for some cash, said
he was going into town to score.

24:36.479 --> 24:38.879
- When was this?
- Over a week ago.

24:40.079 --> 24:42.720
Well, weren't you worried
when he didn't come home?

24:42.759 --> 24:45.680
He used to take off sometimes.
Disappeared for days.

24:45.720 --> 24:49.759
- Do you know where he went?
- Nathan did as he pleased.

24:49.800 --> 24:51.759
He hated being tied down.

24:51.800 --> 24:55.159
He could never go far from the
smack, though. Always pulled him back.

24:55.200 --> 24:57.439
Well, we know he was dealing
to pay for his habit.

24:57.479 --> 24:58.600
Who told you that?

24:58.639 --> 25:01.200
He was selling drugs down
at the needle exchange.

25:01.239 --> 25:04.680
So, I'll ask you again, where's
he getting this heroin from?

25:04.720 --> 25:07.319
- I don't know.
- Not Adam Gascoigne, then?

25:08.360 --> 25:11.319
We know he picked you up from
that swanky flat last night.

25:11.360 --> 25:12.879
You've been keeping tabs on me?

25:12.920 --> 25:15.519
Well, if you'd been honest
with us from the start...

25:15.560 --> 25:19.319
- If he knew I'd been talking...
- What, he'd come after you?

25:19.360 --> 25:22.479
Oh, that's why you were hiding
with the curtains drawn?

25:22.519 --> 25:26.439
Look, love, if someone's threatening
you, we can offer you protection.

25:26.479 --> 25:28.079
I'm doing fine on my own.

25:28.119 --> 25:30.439
Under the thumb of a drug-dealing thug?

25:32.839 --> 25:34.239
You don't get it, do you?

25:34.280 --> 25:38.879
This has always been somewhere safe,
somewhere away from the girl in that flat,

25:38.920 --> 25:41.759
and now you've brought it all here.

25:44.560 --> 25:47.839
I don't know what happened to Nathan,
and I'd rather it stayed that way,

25:47.879 --> 25:50.159
so, please, just leave us alone.

25:51.159 --> 25:52.280
Kyle!

26:01.200 --> 26:02.720
Ma'am.

26:03.560 --> 26:04.959
Anything?

26:05.000 --> 26:07.159
A few clothes, sleeping bag.

26:07.200 --> 26:09.079
I found this in his pocket.

26:10.560 --> 26:13.200
- Father O'Brien?
- Chances are he did a runner.

26:14.200 --> 26:16.159
Nah. Abandon his son?

26:16.200 --> 26:18.000
- The lad's his?
- Mm.

26:18.039 --> 26:20.800
- Probably for the best, then.
- Hark at you!

26:20.839 --> 26:23.519
Dad six months, suddenly
you're Father of the Year.

26:23.560 --> 26:27.000
I was just saying, we could be
looking at a Child Protection issue.

26:28.000 --> 26:30.680
- And Max will be one next week.
- Who?

26:30.720 --> 26:32.200
Oh, right.

26:32.239 --> 26:33.959
Is he?

26:34.000 --> 26:36.319
Yeah, we're having a
few drinks and a cake.

26:36.360 --> 26:39.159
- Oh. - So, you know, if you're free...

26:39.200 --> 26:43.800
Well, I'll tell you what, I'll
drop you back at the station,

26:43.839 --> 26:46.959
you can do a routine enquiry
with social services.

26:47.000 --> 26:49.479
Yeah. It's better to be safe than sorry.

27:10.639 --> 27:15.200
We managed to locate
Nathan's mam, a Diane Weaver.

27:15.239 --> 27:19.759
Ah, you could have left her address
at the centre, saved yourself a trip.

27:19.800 --> 27:22.680
I wanted to talk to you about Nathan.

27:22.720 --> 27:25.439
See, you told me he was troubled.

27:26.479 --> 27:28.239
Well, that was the impression I got.

27:28.280 --> 27:32.159
Yeah, well, I think you knew
him a bit better than that.

27:33.159 --> 27:36.479
You gave him a character reference
for that job at Bennick's.

27:36.519 --> 27:40.079
Well, I was just trying to
get him back on his feet.

27:40.119 --> 27:45.119
And I found this in one of his
pockets, The Sacrament of Confession.

27:45.159 --> 27:46.360
Uh-huh.

27:46.400 --> 27:50.119
Well, he must have picked
it up from the centre.

27:50.159 --> 27:54.560
Well, anything he confided in you
could help shed light on how he died.

27:56.639 --> 27:59.560
You know I can't break the
seal of the confessional.

28:00.519 --> 28:03.039
So he did confess to something, then?

28:22.920 --> 28:24.639
Ma'am, a lorry driver's come in.

28:24.680 --> 28:26.839
Says he gave Nathan a
lift on the night he died.

28:26.879 --> 28:30.759
- I've put him in the interview room.
- Right. Mark, give us that.

28:30.800 --> 28:32.439
Make him another one.

28:36.519 --> 28:37.720
Yeah, that's him.

28:37.759 --> 28:40.319
He was hitching by the
Blue House roundabout.

28:40.360 --> 28:43.439
- What time was this?
- Around nine o'clock Wednesday evening.

28:43.479 --> 28:45.119
So where did you drop him?

28:45.159 --> 28:46.759
Hedgeley Services.

28:46.800 --> 28:50.200
I stopped off to get some
fuel, went in to pay,

28:50.239 --> 28:52.079
realised I'd left my wallet in the cab,

28:52.119 --> 28:55.280
and the thieving toe-rag had nicked
it, ran off across the fields.

29:12.519 --> 29:14.200
Oh. Thanks.

29:16.720 --> 29:18.079
Salmon and cucumber?

29:18.119 --> 29:19.839
I got you the healthy option.

29:20.600 --> 29:22.200
Meaning?

29:22.239 --> 29:23.800
What have you got?

29:24.360 --> 29:26.319
Cheese and pickle. Do you wanna swap?

29:26.360 --> 29:28.000
Go on, then.

29:30.000 --> 29:32.479
What did the cashier have to say?

29:32.519 --> 29:35.800
- Well, she was definitely
working that night. - And?

29:35.839 --> 29:38.239
- Doesn't remember seeing Nathan.
- CCTV?

29:38.280 --> 29:40.159
No, nothing we can work with.

29:42.200 --> 29:47.600
He left Gateshead under his own steam,
on edge, in a hurry, thumbs a lift.

29:47.639 --> 29:49.159
And then does a bunk.

29:50.000 --> 29:53.720
Steals a wallet, so he'll
wanna keep away from the road.

29:54.720 --> 29:58.560
And it's what... It's gone
10:00, it's dark, cold.

29:59.800 --> 30:01.839
He'd be looking for somewhere to kip.

30:01.879 --> 30:04.920
Nearest village is a couple of miles away.

30:04.959 --> 30:06.759
Where's the river from here?

30:16.600 --> 30:19.400
His body was found a mile from here.

30:19.439 --> 30:22.280
So where do you think he was heading, hm?

30:44.920 --> 30:47.079
Check out those outbuildings.

31:29.879 --> 31:31.439
Ma'am!

31:33.280 --> 31:34.839
Have a look at this.

32:01.560 --> 32:04.479
Get on to the station, find
out what happened here.

32:35.039 --> 32:37.479
Looks like Nathan made himself at home.

32:41.079 --> 32:44.000
Right, then, Nathan Weaver.

32:44.039 --> 32:47.079
Possibly killed here.

32:47.119 --> 32:49.360
Or at the house.

32:49.400 --> 32:53.759
Dumped in the river, floats
downstream to where we found him.

32:53.800 --> 32:56.600
That would explain why
the riverbank was clean.

32:57.280 --> 33:00.680
What's the story with this
farmhouse? Any intel yet?

33:00.720 --> 33:02.200
Scene of a homicide.

33:02.239 --> 33:04.600
Domestic: Farmer shot his wife.

33:07.439 --> 33:09.879
That's gotta be over ten years ago.

33:11.239 --> 33:14.920
So Nathan comes across
an old murder scene,

33:14.959 --> 33:17.159
ends up dead himself.

33:18.159 --> 33:21.239
Well, that puts a new slant
on things, doesn't it?

33:26.720 --> 33:30.759
Right, Nathan Weaver
broke into a farmhouse

33:30.800 --> 33:33.239
and it looks like that's
where he's been dossing.

33:33.280 --> 33:36.479
But it also happens to be the
scene of a previous homicide.

33:36.519 --> 33:38.479
China Farm Murder?

33:38.519 --> 33:42.519
Poultry farmer, Edward Thurston,
convicted for killing his wife.

33:42.560 --> 33:44.959
Currently serving life in Dursdale nick.

33:45.000 --> 33:48.000
The farm was on the market for a
few years, couldn't get a buyer.

33:48.039 --> 33:51.720
He's always protested his innocence.
Claimed to have run into intruders.

33:52.759 --> 33:56.800
Thurston shot her. He made up
a story to cover his tracks.

33:56.839 --> 33:59.239
- How do you know that?
- I worked on the case.

33:59.280 --> 34:02.560
Oh, well, perhaps you can fill
us in with the facts, Kenny.

34:06.439 --> 34:09.280
His wife was playing away, Laura Thurston.

34:10.039 --> 34:12.959
She'd packed her bags on
the night she was killed.

34:13.000 --> 34:14.519
So he shot her in cold blood?

34:15.479 --> 34:17.039
Eddie Thurston's a piece of work.

34:17.079 --> 34:19.920
Was there anyone else in
the frame for the murder?

34:21.400 --> 34:25.319
It was 13 years ago... I'll
have to look up the file.

34:25.360 --> 34:27.720
One of the neighbours was
questioned as a suspect.

34:27.759 --> 34:30.280
He'd had a previous altercation
with Eddie Thurston.

34:30.319 --> 34:32.560
A dog walker who was
trespassing on his land.

34:32.600 --> 34:34.200
A dog walker?

34:35.639 --> 34:37.239
This fella got a name?

34:39.720 --> 34:42.000
Well, well, well!

35:09.039 --> 35:10.959
Mr Branning?

35:13.280 --> 35:14.400
Hello?

35:21.519 --> 35:23.039
Mr Branning?

35:26.400 --> 35:28.000
DCI Stanhope.

35:35.639 --> 35:37.159
Mr Branning.

35:46.039 --> 35:47.360
Mr Branning?

36:24.519 --> 36:26.600
- Aiden!
- No one's going anywhere.

36:26.639 --> 36:29.479
Calm down! Just calm down!

36:29.519 --> 36:32.280
If you're gonna lamp me with
that, you better get on with it.

36:32.319 --> 36:35.720
Look, we just need to
talk to you, that's all.

36:35.759 --> 36:38.200
Am I... under arrest?

36:38.239 --> 36:41.360
No, but you will be if you
don't put that thing down.

36:47.119 --> 36:48.400
Come on.

37:01.600 --> 37:04.959
Sorry to keep you, Mr Branning.

37:06.039 --> 37:10.479
Now, according to your statement,
you found Nathan Weaver's body

37:10.519 --> 37:12.519
about 7:00am Thursday morning.

37:12.560 --> 37:14.959
- I was walking the dog.
- Mm.

37:15.000 --> 37:16.920
But let's go back to the night before.

37:16.959 --> 37:18.720
You went for a walk in the fields.

37:18.759 --> 37:20.239
Other side of the woods.

37:21.280 --> 37:23.680
Did you walk across Eddie Thurston's land?

37:27.280 --> 37:29.920
Well, let's see if this helps.

37:30.920 --> 37:35.600
Now, if you walked from
your house to the fields,

37:35.639 --> 37:38.159
you'd have gone right through his farm.

37:38.200 --> 37:40.519
I set a few snares, that's all.

37:41.360 --> 37:43.079
Laura Thurston's murder.

37:43.119 --> 37:46.319
You were questioned as a
possible suspect, weren't you?

37:46.360 --> 37:48.159
What's Laura got to do with all this?

37:48.200 --> 37:50.200
Well, now we've got a second murder

37:50.239 --> 37:53.439
and we're talking to you
as a person of interest.

37:53.479 --> 37:56.439
Now, that's either
rotten luck on your part,

37:56.479 --> 37:58.959
or a bit of a coincidence,
wouldn't you say?

38:00.600 --> 38:03.439
Didn't care for Eddie
Thurston much, did you?

38:03.479 --> 38:07.079
- No one did.
- Ah, but you argued with him.

38:07.119 --> 38:11.959
- A violent altercation according to this.
- He came at me pointing a shotgun.

38:12.959 --> 38:14.319
Told me to get off his land.

38:14.360 --> 38:16.800
Ah, he said you'd been harassing his wife.

38:16.839 --> 38:19.600
I ran into her sometimes, that's all.

38:20.759 --> 38:23.759
She used to go for walks
to get away from him.

38:23.800 --> 38:25.839
Jealous sort, was he?

38:25.879 --> 38:28.839
Hm! Loose with his fists
and tight with his money.

38:28.879 --> 38:30.680
Kept it all under the mattress.

38:32.000 --> 38:34.039
And how do you know that little nugget?

38:34.079 --> 38:35.519
People talk.

38:35.560 --> 38:38.600
Now, I think you'd been
watching that farmhouse

38:38.639 --> 38:41.159
and you knew Nathan had broken in.

38:41.200 --> 38:42.200
No.

38:42.239 --> 38:44.720
Did you see him up there
the night he was killed?

38:44.759 --> 38:47.200
I told you, I found him in the river.

38:47.239 --> 38:51.039
Well, I've got a forensics
team up at the farmhouse.

38:51.079 --> 38:54.000
We'll soon know if you're
telling us the truth.

39:12.720 --> 39:15.839
Ma'am, we can definitely place
Nathan in the farmhouse.

39:15.879 --> 39:19.200
DNA and fibre matches. His
prints are all over the scene.

39:19.239 --> 39:23.079
- It's Jeb Branning we need to pin down!
- We found footprints in the farmyard

39:23.119 --> 39:25.600
that don't match the victim's,
more near the bridge.

39:25.639 --> 39:28.479
Forensics are checking
Jeb's shoes and clothes.

39:28.519 --> 39:30.839
There's some tyre treads
in the mud on the lane.

39:30.879 --> 39:34.079
- Does Jeb Branning own a vehicle?
- We've checked, he doesn't drive.

39:35.959 --> 39:39.360
Right, I want the search moved up
to the house from the riverbank.

39:39.400 --> 39:41.079
We're looking for a murder weapon.

39:41.119 --> 39:42.639
All right to go in?

39:47.400 --> 39:49.720
Oh, SOCOs have set up
in the kitchen, ma'am.

39:51.200 --> 39:55.239
Must be giving you the chills,
Kenny, back to the scene of a murder.

39:56.239 --> 39:59.360
Well, I never expected to set
foot in this place again.

40:00.079 --> 40:03.360
I tell you what, get yourself
over to Jeb Branning's.

40:03.400 --> 40:04.839
I want a detective over there.

40:04.879 --> 40:06.839
I thought you needed help with a sweep?

40:06.879 --> 40:09.319
Oh, Hicham can cover
it, fresh pair of eyes.

40:09.360 --> 40:11.039
Go on, we can manage.

40:12.560 --> 40:14.400
Ma'am.

40:42.680 --> 40:45.000
Nathan's prints are all over this room.

40:45.039 --> 40:47.200
Probably looking for stuff to nick.

40:47.239 --> 40:49.000
So, what do we think?

40:50.800 --> 40:53.800
Jeb Branning knows the
lad's been snooping.

40:53.839 --> 40:56.479
Is he afraid he's gonna find something?

40:56.519 --> 40:58.319
Something to tie him to
Laura Thurston's death.

40:58.360 --> 41:00.720
What, then kills him to silence him?

41:02.280 --> 41:07.280
- Nah. Don't think he's got it in him.
- He did wave a big bloody stick at us.

41:08.400 --> 41:10.600
Two murders, one crime scene.

41:11.600 --> 41:16.039
This old case. Abusive relationship.

41:16.079 --> 41:17.680
She calls it quits.

41:18.479 --> 41:20.000
All set to leave him.

41:20.039 --> 41:22.000
According to Kenny, she was playing away.

41:22.039 --> 41:25.639
- But Thurston always denied that.
- Well, it gave him a motive to kill her.

41:26.720 --> 41:27.839
Hm.

41:29.439 --> 41:31.039
Look.

41:37.000 --> 41:41.280
He comes home, finds his
wife with her bags packed.

41:41.319 --> 41:44.280
He gets a shotgun from this cupboard.

41:44.319 --> 41:46.680
Forensics found the slug
cases in the hallway.

41:46.720 --> 41:48.079
And her body was found?

41:48.119 --> 41:50.360
- Bottom of the stairs.
- Right.

41:50.400 --> 41:55.800
So, he comes through this
door with a shotgun, right?

41:56.879 --> 41:58.800
Now, she's coming down the stairs.

42:01.000 --> 42:03.000
Right, here she comes.

42:04.000 --> 42:06.159
I'll be Laura, you be
Eddie. Get over there.

42:06.200 --> 42:08.600
Right, now, come on, shoot me.

42:09.800 --> 42:11.600
- Bang.
- Yeah, twice.

42:12.600 --> 42:15.720
- Bang. - She falls
down, fatally injured.

42:15.759 --> 42:20.239
There's blood on the walls and the
skirting according to the crime report.

42:20.280 --> 42:23.039
One shot to the stomach, one to the chest.

42:24.159 --> 42:27.600
A farmer, used to handling guns...

42:28.720 --> 42:32.239
.. he has to take two shots to
kill her, point blank range?

42:32.280 --> 42:35.479
Cold-blooded killer, profile fits.

42:36.600 --> 42:39.879
Unless Eddie Thurston's telling the truth,

42:39.920 --> 42:44.800
and there were intruders
in the house that night.

43:26.200 --> 43:27.839
Mr Thurston.

43:28.920 --> 43:31.439
You've consented to a voluntary interview.

43:32.720 --> 43:37.079
I'd like to ask you a few questions
about an ongoing investigation.

43:39.560 --> 43:43.439
This fella was found dead near
your farm a couple of days ago,

43:43.519 --> 43:46.680
and we've reason to believe
he'd broken into your farmhouse.

43:48.239 --> 43:49.600
Do you recognise him?

43:50.200 --> 43:52.000
Never seen him before.

43:54.839 --> 43:58.039
Can I take you back to the
night your wife was shot?

43:58.119 --> 44:02.800
Now, you claimed there were intruders
in the house the night your wife died.

44:02.879 --> 44:03.959
Burglary.

44:04.039 --> 44:05.560
It's all in my statement.

44:06.800 --> 44:09.519
Well, I'd like to hear
your version of events.

44:09.600 --> 44:14.119
Why? So you can twist my
words, like they did last time?

44:15.039 --> 44:16.519
Make me into a liar?

44:16.600 --> 44:19.759
Well, if you don't want to
talk, that's your prerogative.

44:19.839 --> 44:21.639
Completely understand.

44:21.720 --> 44:25.159
Put this down to a wasted journey.

44:27.920 --> 44:29.479
I come back late.

44:31.920 --> 44:33.920
The front door was wide open.

44:36.159 --> 44:37.759
She was upstairs.

44:39.000 --> 44:41.000
I could hear her screaming.

44:41.959 --> 44:43.920
Laura was upstairs?

44:45.560 --> 44:47.200
I fetched a shotgun.

44:47.280 --> 44:49.479
I didn't have time to think.

44:51.400 --> 44:53.200
One of them had a...

44:54.439 --> 44:55.920
.. knife to her throat...

44:57.000 --> 44:58.079
.. and...

44:58.159 --> 44:59.720
Just take your time.

45:02.200 --> 45:05.439
Another fella jumped me
from behind, grabbed the gun.

45:06.439 --> 45:08.079
What happened then was...

45:08.680 --> 45:13.720
Well, Laura, she's lying
on the floor, and she's...

45:15.560 --> 45:17.039
.. bleeding.

45:17.879 --> 45:21.079
Did you see their faces, the lads?

45:21.159 --> 45:23.319
No, they were wearing scarves.

45:24.319 --> 45:25.759
Hoods over their heads.

45:25.839 --> 45:28.200
Could Jeb Branning have been one of them?

45:29.639 --> 45:31.519
He knew the farm well enough.

45:33.000 --> 45:36.759
Now, you say these intruders
made off with certain items.

45:38.360 --> 45:40.000
Do you recognise this?

45:43.680 --> 45:46.439
- It might be Laura's.
- Can you be certain?

45:47.680 --> 45:49.839
It's been 13 years.

45:56.519 --> 45:58.119
Right, we're done here.

45:59.519 --> 46:02.519
They refused my parole, do you hear?

46:03.639 --> 46:05.360
But I didn't kill anyone.

46:05.439 --> 46:07.039
They stitched me up.

46:21.200 --> 46:25.119
Refuses parole, his one chance of freedom.

46:25.200 --> 46:29.039
After 13 years banged up,
you'd just say you did it.

46:29.119 --> 46:30.560
You think he could be innocent?

46:30.639 --> 46:34.039
Let's say he's telling the truth,
the killer could still be out there.

46:34.119 --> 46:35.800
Puts Jeb Branning in the frame.

46:35.879 --> 46:39.119
So who was the other intruder, hm?

46:39.200 --> 46:42.600
Nah, Jeb Branning's a
loner, one man and his dog.

46:42.680 --> 46:46.560
And that ring, if that was your wife's,
you'd recognise it, wouldn't you?

46:46.639 --> 46:48.119
After 13 years?

46:48.200 --> 46:52.319
Well, those are the sort of things
you hang on to, things you remember.

46:54.360 --> 46:55.959
Get Mark on the case.

46:56.039 --> 46:58.280
Jewellers, pawn shops.

46:58.360 --> 47:01.639
I mean, if Nathan really
was fleecing that farmhouse,

47:01.720 --> 47:03.839
stealing Laura's stuff to sell on...

47:03.920 --> 47:06.239
- Someone must have
been buying it. - Right!

47:09.759 --> 47:11.159
Ma'am!

47:15.759 --> 47:18.159
- You went to see
Thurston in prison? - Aye.

47:18.239 --> 47:20.119
Needed to ask him some questions.

47:20.200 --> 47:21.839
I should have been there with you.

47:21.920 --> 47:25.360
You put the man away, Kenny, no
telling how he would have reacted.

47:25.439 --> 47:28.039
Thurston plays people. He
gets his kicks out of it.

47:28.119 --> 47:31.000
Oh. Think he got the
measure of me, do you?

47:32.200 --> 47:33.319
No.

47:35.159 --> 47:37.239
What makes you so sure he's guilty?

47:37.319 --> 47:40.280
That feeling you get
after years at the job.

47:40.360 --> 47:41.839
I know he did it.

47:41.920 --> 47:46.000
Gut instinct's all very well, Kenny, as
long as it's backed up with hard evidence.

47:46.079 --> 47:48.680
- It was. - Well, there's
nothing to worry about, then.

47:48.759 --> 47:51.280
Ma'am, there's a
pawnbrokers over in Blaydon,

47:51.360 --> 47:53.680
it's a couple of streets
from the needle exchange.

47:53.759 --> 47:55.839
It's where all the
addicts pawn their stuff.

47:55.920 --> 47:58.400
Run by a woman known as Auntie Val.

47:58.479 --> 48:01.519
Right, come on, let's go see Auntie.

48:22.680 --> 48:23.920
How can I help?

48:24.000 --> 48:26.879
We're trying to trace the
movements of this man.

48:26.959 --> 48:29.639
We think he might have
been one of your customers.

48:29.720 --> 48:32.000
- Doesn't ring any bells.
- No?

48:32.079 --> 48:35.800
He was caught on a surveillance
camera entering and leaving your shop.

48:35.879 --> 48:41.280
Now, I think on, he was in
here some time last week.

48:41.360 --> 48:43.400
Hm. Name of Nathan Weaver.

48:44.039 --> 48:45.879
Junkie, was he?

48:46.360 --> 48:47.920
What makes you say that?

48:48.000 --> 48:50.039
We get them in here all the time.

48:50.119 --> 48:53.079
They'd sell you their
shoes if it paid for a fix.

48:53.159 --> 48:56.479
Ah, well, we think he was trying
to hock some stuff in a hurry.

48:56.560 --> 48:58.639
Most of my customers are.

48:59.800 --> 49:02.959
No. Nothing on "loans outstanding".

49:08.159 --> 49:11.360
DS Healey, I reckon most
of this stuff's knocked off.

49:11.439 --> 49:13.600
- How long to come back with a warrant?
- 20 minutes.

49:13.680 --> 49:15.560
Yeah, we'll tear the place apart.

49:18.680 --> 49:21.200
He'd turn up every few weeks or so.

49:21.280 --> 49:23.159
Pocket full of jewellery.

49:25.759 --> 49:27.280
Where's he getting it from?

49:27.360 --> 49:29.959
- I just buy it and sell it.
- No questions asked?

49:30.039 --> 49:34.680
Look, if any of that stuff was nicked,
obviously I wouldn't have touched it.

49:36.439 --> 49:38.920
Did he ever try to flog you this?

49:40.720 --> 49:42.119
Oh, now...

49:44.439 --> 49:46.759
.. that he wouldn't part with.

49:47.920 --> 49:52.039
Sentimental value, he said. They'll
do anything to put the price up.

49:52.119 --> 49:54.680
He'll be back on the make
when the money runs out.

49:54.759 --> 49:57.400
And if he shows his face,
I'll give you a call.

49:57.479 --> 49:59.839
Ah, a bit late for that, love.

49:59.920 --> 50:01.560
He's been murdered.

50:10.680 --> 50:12.000
Surveillance camera?

50:12.079 --> 50:14.400
Well, it did the trick, got her talking.

50:16.239 --> 50:18.600
And do a background check on Auntie Val.

50:18.680 --> 50:20.720
She's as bent as a dog's hind leg.

50:51.239 --> 50:53.920
Ma'am, I'm at Jeb Branning's place.

50:55.360 --> 50:57.360
Looks like we've found something.

51:05.159 --> 51:08.039
We found a steel wrench
hidden in your bathroom.

51:08.079 --> 51:10.159
Traces of Nathan Weaver's blood.

51:10.200 --> 51:12.439
We found your footprints
up near the farmhouse,

51:12.479 --> 51:14.600
which proves you've been lying to us.

51:14.639 --> 51:17.519
I've got enough evidence to
charge you with his murder.

51:17.560 --> 51:19.479
I found it!

51:23.239 --> 51:26.039
Up near the bridge in the long grass.

51:27.039 --> 51:30.439
- I took it home.
- Now, why on earth would you do that?

51:30.479 --> 51:32.159
I just pick things up.

51:33.239 --> 51:35.079
I can't help myself sometimes.

51:35.119 --> 51:37.519
So what were you doing
up at the farmhouse?

51:38.439 --> 51:41.280
I knew he'd broken in, the dead lad.

51:41.319 --> 51:44.159
I was gonna confront him, warn him off.

51:45.159 --> 51:48.200
That was when the other
fella drove up from the lane.

51:48.239 --> 51:50.400
Well, what did this other fella look like?

51:50.439 --> 51:52.400
It was pitch black!

51:52.439 --> 51:54.119
Headlights were blinding!

51:54.159 --> 51:57.720
So, this vehicle pulls
up to the farmhouse?

51:57.759 --> 52:00.119
The lad came out to meet him.

52:00.159 --> 52:01.280
Nathan.

52:01.319 --> 52:04.360
- And then what?
- They started shouting.

52:04.400 --> 52:09.319
Sounded like a fight. The lad
took off towards the bridge.

52:11.039 --> 52:12.759
It all went quiet for a while.

52:14.439 --> 52:17.239
The next thing I know, he
drives off like the clappers.

52:17.280 --> 52:19.119
Nearly ran me off the lane!

52:19.159 --> 52:21.479
So what happened to Nathan?

52:21.519 --> 52:23.360
I went up to the bridge.

52:24.360 --> 52:26.000
There was no sign of anyone.

52:26.039 --> 52:29.600
That was when I found it, the wrench.

52:29.639 --> 52:33.039
And you wait until the following
morning to ring the police?

52:33.079 --> 52:35.720
I wasn't supposed to be there.

52:46.360 --> 52:49.119
Friction from the plastic bags
wiped off any of the prints.

52:49.159 --> 52:51.280
Well, anyone could have
had their hands on it!

52:51.319 --> 52:54.920
Yeah, I'll run some tests for DNA,
but I'm not holding out much hope.

52:54.959 --> 52:57.360
What about the crime scene, anything?

52:57.400 --> 53:01.280
Tyre treads back up his statement.
Large vehicle, something substantial.

53:01.319 --> 53:02.759
The footprints on the bridge,

53:02.800 --> 53:06.039
they don't match either Jeb's or
the trainers worn by the victim.

53:06.079 --> 53:08.560
- So someone else was up there.
- Mm-hm.

53:10.200 --> 53:13.200
First thing tomorrow morning, I
want you back up at that farm.

53:13.239 --> 53:15.119
There's not a lot more we can get.

53:15.159 --> 53:19.000
No, I want a fresh forensic sweep
of the Laura Thurston murder scene.

53:19.560 --> 53:20.639
Seriously?

53:22.239 --> 53:23.920
A 13-year-old homicide?

53:23.959 --> 53:26.439
Unless you don't think
you're up for the challenge?

53:26.479 --> 53:29.680
No, no. Challenge duly noted. Count me in.

53:29.720 --> 53:31.119
Thanks, Tony.

53:31.159 --> 53:32.519
All right.

53:32.560 --> 53:35.400
Hold off charging Jeb Branning for now.

53:35.439 --> 53:36.800
Sorry? Ma'am?

53:38.839 --> 53:41.239
But we found the murder
weapon hidden in his house.

53:41.280 --> 53:42.759
We've got him bang to rights.

53:42.800 --> 53:45.519
Well, he maintains there was
someone else up at that farm,

53:45.560 --> 53:47.400
and forensic evidence backs that up.

53:47.439 --> 53:50.839
Well, he's been in custody 24 hours,
we either charge him, or we let him go.

53:50.879 --> 53:53.959
Well, charge him with
obstructing a murder enquiry.

53:54.959 --> 53:58.479
And in the meantime, let's have a
look at Eddie Thurston's conviction,

53:58.519 --> 54:01.239
because I think there's a
connection to Nathan Weaver.

54:01.280 --> 54:03.879
I told you, we are wasting
our time with Eddie Thurston!

54:03.920 --> 54:07.079
Well, you're just gonna
have to indulge me, Kenny.

54:07.119 --> 54:08.519
Fine!

54:10.319 --> 54:13.280
Well, Eddie Thurston said
he disturbed a robbery.

54:13.319 --> 54:17.720
Right, we all know he was a tightwad,
kept his hard-earned under the mattress.

54:17.759 --> 54:21.720
- Who else might have known about that?
- I've been looking into Thurston's finances.

54:21.759 --> 54:23.039
The farm was in trouble.

54:23.079 --> 54:25.759
Well, draw up a list of all
his business associates --

54:25.800 --> 54:28.000
suppliers, customers, the lot.

54:28.039 --> 54:30.280
What about his wife, this
affair she was having?

54:30.319 --> 54:33.439
Well, we know her bags were
packed, but where was she heading?

54:33.479 --> 54:36.400
I'll have to inform the CPS
if we're reopening the case.

54:36.439 --> 54:41.159
We're reviewing the case, because it's
relevant to the current investigation!

54:41.200 --> 54:46.119
Now, can we please just concentrate
on our number one priority,

54:46.159 --> 54:49.319
and that's finding Nathan Weaver's killer.

54:49.360 --> 54:50.879
Yes, ma'am.

55:55.839 --> 55:58.759
Sorry to disturb you so late, ma'am.

55:58.800 --> 56:00.000
I...

56:02.239 --> 56:03.800
Better come in.

56:17.360 --> 56:19.000
So, what couldn't wait?

56:22.079 --> 56:24.360
It's hardly a social call, Kenny.

56:29.560 --> 56:31.360
The China Farm murder case.

56:32.959 --> 56:35.239
Ah, wanna get something off your chest?

56:35.280 --> 56:37.039
I was the first officer on the scene.

56:37.079 --> 56:39.720
Aye, I know you were. It's all in the log.

56:40.720 --> 56:43.400
But I must confess to being a tad puzzled.

56:43.439 --> 56:45.439
Now, here, look at this.

56:46.720 --> 56:51.400
Here's the initial photos
taken at the scene here.

56:51.439 --> 56:52.959
The sitting room.

56:53.759 --> 56:57.400
The windowsill is completely clear, right?

56:58.400 --> 57:03.479
But in the official CSI
photos, two hours later...

57:06.000 --> 57:07.280
.. look at this.

57:07.319 --> 57:09.039
Same windowsill.

57:09.079 --> 57:11.600
There's a bloody great vase on it!

57:12.600 --> 57:16.239
We were working with a new police
surgeon. First day on the job.

57:17.360 --> 57:20.079
Well, I could see he was
a bit nervous, covering.

57:21.000 --> 57:23.280
He knocked the vase onto the floor.

57:23.319 --> 57:25.839
So I picked it up, put it back

57:25.879 --> 57:27.600
and told him not to worry.

57:29.200 --> 57:30.959
It was only later, I realised...

57:31.000 --> 57:33.519
You should have put it
back on the bookcase.

57:34.519 --> 57:37.319
Right? But you put it on the windowsill.

57:37.360 --> 57:41.239
So when CSIs processed the scene,

57:41.280 --> 57:45.239
they didn't consider this particular
window as a possible point of entry

57:45.280 --> 57:48.680
for those intruders Thurston
was banging on about.

57:49.800 --> 57:53.920
- It was an honest mistake.
- Aye, but you covered it up!

57:53.959 --> 57:56.720
We were all under pressure
to get a conviction.

57:56.759 --> 57:58.959
It would compromise the crime scene.

57:59.000 --> 58:02.119
Yeah, well, now you've compromised
my investigation, Kenny!

58:02.159 --> 58:03.560
That's why we're talking.

58:03.600 --> 58:08.519
If we had found some evidence that
gave weight to this burglary...

58:10.239 --> 58:13.280
.. then Eddie Thurston's
testimony might have stacked up.

58:18.439 --> 58:21.800
Get yourself home, Kenny, we'll
talk about this in the morning.

58:25.200 --> 58:26.839
Goodnight, ma'am.

58:30.439 --> 58:31.639
Ma'am...

58:50.280 --> 58:51.600
Kelly?

59:28.239 --> 59:29.839
Come on.

59:30.839 --> 59:32.519
Nearly there.

59:32.560 --> 59:33.959
Come on.

59:36.079 --> 59:37.879
Good, good. You've got one more.

59:37.920 --> 59:39.920
Just in there.

1:00:02.400 --> 1:00:06.600
Ma'am. I've been trying to call you. I've
got news on the China Farm murder case.

1:00:06.680 --> 1:00:08.759
Yeah, well, I'm here
now, what's so important?

1:00:08.839 --> 1:00:12.159
- You told us to look at Thurston's
business accounts. - Have you done it?

1:00:12.200 --> 1:00:16.200
He'd lost a contract with his biggest
customer, Bennick's Convenience Foods.

1:00:16.239 --> 1:00:17.400
What?

1:00:18.319 --> 1:00:20.720
Of course, Thurston was a poultry farmer.

1:00:20.759 --> 1:00:22.879
It's the factory where Nathan was sacked.

1:00:22.920 --> 1:00:26.439
The contract was terminated six weeks
before Laura Thurston was murdered.

1:00:26.159 --> 1:00:27.800
Was it, indeed?

1:00:27.839 --> 1:00:31.039
If Brian Bennick was doing
business with Eddie Thurston...

1:00:31.079 --> 1:00:33.159
He'd have been at that
farm on a regular basis.

1:00:33.200 --> 1:00:37.119
- So where does Nathan fit in to all this?
- Disgruntled ex-employee,

1:00:37.159 --> 1:00:40.680
holding a grudge, finds out
the dirt on Brian and Eddie.

1:00:40.720 --> 1:00:43.439
- So what did they fall out about?
- It's usually money.

1:00:43.479 --> 1:00:45.159
Oh, no.

1:00:46.159 --> 1:00:48.639
I think it was something more than that.

1:00:50.280 --> 1:00:51.800
Aiden, with me.

1:01:02.959 --> 1:01:04.680
Is the gaffer about?

1:01:04.720 --> 1:01:07.119
We're a bit pushed this
morning. Maybe I can help?

1:01:07.159 --> 1:01:08.959
I'll deal with this, Joe.

1:01:09.000 --> 1:01:12.800
Ah, Mr Bennick, I've just got a
couple more questions for you.

1:01:12.839 --> 1:01:14.000
We can talk inside.

1:01:14.039 --> 1:01:15.159
Everything OK?

1:01:15.200 --> 1:01:18.039
I need a list of all the vehicles
registered to your company.

1:01:18.079 --> 1:01:20.879
- What's all this about?
- Just following procedure.

1:01:22.479 --> 1:01:25.000
Aye, we had a contract
with Eddie Thurston.

1:01:25.039 --> 1:01:27.519
Most of our suppliers
have always been local.

1:01:27.560 --> 1:01:30.400
But the contract was
cancelled. Why was that?

1:01:30.439 --> 1:01:34.119
Difficult man to do business with. He
didn't leave us with a lot of choice.

1:01:34.839 --> 1:01:38.000
Did you ever have any
dealings with Thurston's wife,

1:01:38.039 --> 1:01:39.519
the woman who was murdered?

1:01:39.560 --> 1:01:42.959
- Laura had nothing to do with the business.
- First names, then?

1:01:43.600 --> 1:01:45.360
I might have met her once or twice.

1:01:45.400 --> 1:01:48.479
I think Eddie Thurston
cancelled that contract

1:01:48.519 --> 1:01:52.000
because he found out his
missus had been playing away.

1:01:53.159 --> 1:01:55.360
Now have a little peek at these.

1:01:56.159 --> 1:02:02.600
Purchase orders signed by you and
countersigned by Laura Thurston.

1:02:04.000 --> 1:02:07.280
She was your first port
of call up at the farm.

1:02:08.600 --> 1:02:10.879
That when it started, hm?

1:02:11.920 --> 1:02:13.439
The affair.

1:02:14.519 --> 1:02:17.519
- Well, I'll take that as a yes.
- He used to knock her about.

1:02:19.839 --> 1:02:22.759
I'd see her in the office,
trying to hide the bruises.

1:02:24.519 --> 1:02:26.319
I suppose I felt sorry for her.

1:02:26.360 --> 1:02:28.319
So you went to the farm
that night to pick her up?

1:02:28.360 --> 1:02:30.360
- No.
- Eddie comes home early,

1:02:30.400 --> 1:02:32.079
finds the pair of you doing a flit.

1:02:32.119 --> 1:02:34.639
- That not how it happened!
- We've found a connection

1:02:34.680 --> 1:02:37.720
between you and Nathan Weaver,
that lad who was murdered,

1:02:37.759 --> 1:02:40.879
and not just to do with working here.

1:02:40.920 --> 1:02:42.759
He's been staying up at China Farm.

1:02:42.800 --> 1:02:44.400
- What?
- Mm!

1:02:44.439 --> 1:02:47.239
You send him packing
with a flea in his ear.

1:02:47.280 --> 1:02:51.200
Did he find something to tie
you to Laura Thurston's murder?

1:02:51.239 --> 1:02:53.879
I had nothing to do with her murder.

1:02:53.920 --> 1:02:57.039
And can you see why I
find that hard to believe?

1:02:57.079 --> 1:02:58.200
All right!

1:03:02.159 --> 1:03:03.920
Yeah, we made plans.

1:03:07.079 --> 1:03:08.639
It was too fast.

1:03:12.000 --> 1:03:13.560
We didn't think it through.

1:03:14.639 --> 1:03:16.839
She was waiting for me up at the farm...

1:03:19.159 --> 1:03:21.159
.. but I couldn't go through with it.

1:03:25.079 --> 1:03:28.959
I could've stopped it, if only
I'd had the balls to go up there.

1:03:31.319 --> 1:03:32.839
But I didn't.

1:03:34.519 --> 1:03:36.159
I just drove away.

1:03:38.560 --> 1:03:40.479
Next day, it was all over the news.

1:03:41.239 --> 1:03:43.119
No mention of you, luckily!

1:03:43.159 --> 1:03:44.280
Lucky?

1:03:45.280 --> 1:03:50.239
I live with it, for 13
years, what he did to her.

1:03:51.600 --> 1:03:54.119
Eddie Thurston killed his wife.

1:03:55.200 --> 1:03:56.759
Everyone knows it.

1:04:05.959 --> 1:04:08.680
Ma'am. I ran those checks
on Stuart Mayfield's plates.

1:04:08.720 --> 1:04:09.839
And?

1:04:09.879 --> 1:04:13.039
We got this from a surveillance
camera by the needle exchange.

1:04:14.800 --> 1:04:17.400
Tuesday night, 10:15.

1:04:17.439 --> 1:04:20.639
That's the night before Nathan was killed.

1:04:20.680 --> 1:04:23.800
Is that Stuart Mayfield
driving? I can't see his face.

1:04:23.839 --> 1:04:25.319
Oh, here comes Kelly.

1:04:26.879 --> 1:04:30.479
And here's Nathan, our dead man walking.

1:04:31.239 --> 1:04:34.039
And there he is, Stuart Mayfield.

1:04:34.079 --> 1:04:36.119
No wonder he wanted this buried!

1:04:37.280 --> 1:04:40.000
The pair of them are lying
through their teeth.

1:04:41.159 --> 1:04:43.759
Right, now, here we are.

1:04:46.360 --> 1:04:50.280
Now, you told me you hadn't seen
Kelly for a couple of months.

1:04:50.319 --> 1:04:51.439
That's right.

1:04:51.479 --> 1:04:56.800
But the pair of you were caught
on CCTV threatening Nathan Weaver,

1:04:56.839 --> 1:04:59.159
who you said you didn't know,

1:04:59.200 --> 1:05:01.639
the day before he disappeared.

1:05:05.959 --> 1:05:07.600
He'd been hassling Kelly.

1:05:08.400 --> 1:05:10.759
She called me, asked me to pick her up.

1:05:10.800 --> 1:05:13.079
You were a client.

1:05:17.400 --> 1:05:19.439
It wasn't just a paid-for thing.

1:05:19.479 --> 1:05:23.600
Now, what goes on between consenting
adults, that's none of my business.

1:05:23.639 --> 1:05:27.639
But it does make me wonder
what else you're hiding.

1:05:27.680 --> 1:05:29.319
I don't know what you mean.

1:05:29.360 --> 1:05:34.239
For example, Adam Gascoigne, what did
he think of your little arrangement?

1:05:34.280 --> 1:05:37.319
And don't try telling me
you don't know him either,

1:05:37.360 --> 1:05:40.839
because you called each
other on a regular basis.

1:05:43.720 --> 1:05:45.639
He knew I'd been seeing Kelly.

1:05:46.400 --> 1:05:48.439
Found out I was in property.

1:05:48.479 --> 1:05:50.039
Offered me a deal.

1:05:50.639 --> 1:05:54.479
- What sort of deal?
- I agreed to let her use the flat.

1:05:54.519 --> 1:05:57.439
Gave Adam the keys to some
other empty properties.

1:05:58.319 --> 1:06:00.879
Places his girls could entertain in.

1:06:00.920 --> 1:06:03.079
- Ooh! Get a cut of the profits? - No.

1:06:03.119 --> 1:06:04.879
So what was in it for you?

1:06:06.759 --> 1:06:10.839
I play ball, I get to keep seeing Kelly.

1:06:11.839 --> 1:06:16.680
If I don't... the wife gets to
hear about what we've been up to.

1:06:17.680 --> 1:06:19.000
OK.

1:06:20.000 --> 1:06:22.400
So let's go back to Tuesday.

1:06:22.439 --> 1:06:24.319
What were you arguing about?

1:06:24.360 --> 1:06:27.879
Nathan started mouthing off. I'd
already warned him to watch his step.

1:06:27.920 --> 1:06:31.879
Oh... homeless junkie
dragging Kelly into the gutter?

1:06:31.920 --> 1:06:34.119
He didn't deserve her. I told him as much.

1:06:34.159 --> 1:06:37.680
So you saw Nathan Weaver as a
threat to your relationship.

1:06:37.720 --> 1:06:39.159
I didn't mean...

1:06:39.200 --> 1:06:44.800
You warned him off, which makes me
think you had unfinished business.

1:06:46.239 --> 1:06:48.079
That was the last time I saw him.

1:06:52.360 --> 1:06:53.800
Ma'am, a word.

1:06:57.800 --> 1:06:59.319
I'll be back.

1:07:04.079 --> 1:07:06.560
A neighbour of Kelly's just
called in a disturbance.

1:07:06.600 --> 1:07:08.519
Paramedics found her beaten up.

1:07:09.360 --> 1:07:11.720
- Where is she?
- They've taken her to AAU.

1:07:12.720 --> 1:07:14.239
Get your coat.

1:07:18.239 --> 1:07:19.959
You need to be brave for me.

1:07:22.560 --> 1:07:24.200
Just until I'm better.

1:07:24.879 --> 1:07:28.119
This lady is gonna look after you.

1:07:38.000 --> 1:07:42.800
Right, you talk to the social
worker, I'll go see Kelly.

1:07:45.920 --> 1:07:48.039
Your son's in safe hands.

1:07:48.800 --> 1:07:51.239
That's supposed to put my mind at rest?

1:07:51.280 --> 1:07:55.839
Just give me a name, love,
the man who did this to you.

1:07:55.879 --> 1:07:57.680
I got this for talking to you!

1:07:59.200 --> 1:08:00.800
He said next time it'd be Kyle.

1:08:00.839 --> 1:08:03.920
There won't be a next time, not
if I have anything to do with it.

1:08:05.319 --> 1:08:08.519
I'll tell you what I know if you
put in a word with social services.

1:08:08.560 --> 1:08:10.839
Ah, that's out of my hands, love.

1:08:11.600 --> 1:08:15.959
But if you cooperate, I'll make sure
you're presented in a favourable light.

1:08:19.720 --> 1:08:24.239
Now, you told me you hadn't
seen Nathan for over a week.

1:08:24.280 --> 1:08:26.200
I'd thrown him out. I had to.

1:08:26.239 --> 1:08:28.680
But you saw him the night
before he left town.

1:08:28.720 --> 1:08:32.239
You called Stuart Mayfield
to come and warn him off.

1:08:33.079 --> 1:08:35.319
Stuart can be overprotective.

1:08:35.360 --> 1:08:37.839
They pay for your time,
they think they own you.

1:08:37.879 --> 1:08:43.720
You were playing your landlord like
a fiddle, you and Adam Gascoigne.

1:08:44.479 --> 1:08:48.519
Now, I think you owe me the truth,
love. You certainly owe it to Nathan.

1:08:50.519 --> 1:08:52.600
Nathan turned up at the centre.

1:08:52.639 --> 1:08:57.000
He was rattling, he needed a fix. He
said he wanted to see his son before...

1:08:57.039 --> 1:08:58.720
Before what?

1:08:59.959 --> 1:09:03.079
He said he was leaving. He was scared.

1:09:04.119 --> 1:09:07.159
- Well, who was he running from?
- I don't know.

1:09:07.200 --> 1:09:09.400
- Adam Gascoigne?
- I don't know!

1:09:09.439 --> 1:09:11.439
I meant what I said about protection.

1:09:11.479 --> 1:09:15.039
- A copper outside the front door?
- If that's what it takes, yes, love!

1:09:15.079 --> 1:09:17.680
Kelly, you've got to trust me.

1:09:21.680 --> 1:09:24.039
Nathan was buying his gear from him.

1:09:24.079 --> 1:09:26.879
Adam gave him a loan
whenever he was short.

1:09:26.920 --> 1:09:30.680
At first he'd just front him for a
bag or two, let him build up a debt.

1:09:30.720 --> 1:09:32.720
But made sure Nathan owed him.

1:09:32.759 --> 1:09:35.319
It all got out of hand
when Nathan couldn't pay.

1:09:35.360 --> 1:09:38.519
He started using the stuff
instead of selling it on.

1:09:38.560 --> 1:09:40.360
It was like he didn't care any more.

1:09:40.400 --> 1:09:42.000
So how much did he owe?

1:09:42.039 --> 1:09:43.879
A couple of thousand.

1:09:43.920 --> 1:09:46.720
That's hardly enough to get him killed.

1:09:47.439 --> 1:09:51.360
You don't know Adam,
the people he works for.

1:09:51.400 --> 1:09:54.959
Do you think Adam Gascoigne killed Nathan?

1:09:56.879 --> 1:10:00.319
He told me Nathan had got
what was coming to him.

1:10:02.239 --> 1:10:04.159
The debt was still outstanding.

1:10:05.039 --> 1:10:06.759
File an assault charge, love.

1:10:07.720 --> 1:10:10.839
Just make a statement. I'll
make sure he's locked up.

1:10:32.800 --> 1:10:36.680
All right, everyone,
show's over. As you were.

1:10:36.720 --> 1:10:39.159
I have a warrant to search these premises.

1:10:39.200 --> 1:10:42.519
Phone records, emails, business contacts,

1:10:42.560 --> 1:10:44.959
anything that ties him to Nathan Weaver.

1:11:06.280 --> 1:11:12.239
Phone log of calls made and received by
Nathan Weaver the week before he died.

1:11:12.280 --> 1:11:15.200
You called Nathan twice
the day he was murdered.

1:11:15.239 --> 1:11:17.079
Doesn't prove anything.

1:11:17.119 --> 1:11:19.039
It proves you've been lying to us.

1:11:20.119 --> 1:11:22.639
Kelly told us the toe-rag
had been giving her trouble.

1:11:22.680 --> 1:11:24.360
I rang to warn him off.

1:11:24.400 --> 1:11:27.319
No, no, no. Stuart Mayfield
had already done that.

1:11:27.360 --> 1:11:30.319
And we know about that
little set up an' all.

1:11:30.360 --> 1:11:32.200
Business acquaintance.

1:11:32.239 --> 1:11:34.720
Who told you where Nathan was hiding?

1:11:35.439 --> 1:11:38.439
You went to see him up
at that farm near Alnwick.

1:11:38.479 --> 1:11:40.680
What farm? I've never been near any farm.

1:11:40.720 --> 1:11:42.479
You sure about that?

1:11:42.519 --> 1:11:44.519
Aye, crystal.

1:11:45.680 --> 1:11:47.759
Well, we'll come back to that.

1:11:47.800 --> 1:11:50.680
In the meantime, you're looking
at a stretch for assault,

1:11:50.720 --> 1:11:52.680
bearing in mind your Prevention Order,

1:11:52.720 --> 1:11:55.839
cos Kelly Horton has
decided to press charges.

1:11:55.879 --> 1:11:59.239
- She'll never testify.
- What, you'll see to that, will you?

1:11:59.280 --> 1:12:01.879
No one's gonna believe that lying cow.

1:12:01.920 --> 1:12:03.079
Nah.

1:12:03.119 --> 1:12:05.280
I grew up around fellas like you.

1:12:06.439 --> 1:12:08.119
You don't frighten me, love.

1:12:09.839 --> 1:12:11.319
Read him his rights.

1:12:32.400 --> 1:12:37.959
- I've told you everything I know.
- Here's the thing, I don't think you have.

1:12:38.959 --> 1:12:45.000
Now, I've been going through your property
portfolio, residential and commercial.

1:12:45.039 --> 1:12:46.759
Oh, it's pretty impressive!

1:12:47.400 --> 1:12:52.720
And I'd wager good money that one of
these lock-ups you've got on your books

1:12:52.759 --> 1:12:57.119
is where Adam Gascoigne stores his heroin.

1:12:57.879 --> 1:12:59.959
I don't know what he's
been storing in there.

1:13:00.000 --> 1:13:01.159
Turn a blind eye, do you?

1:13:01.200 --> 1:13:03.720
Look, he said if I wanted
to keep seeing Kelly that...

1:13:03.759 --> 1:13:06.159
Oh, look, there's no easy
way to tell you this, love,

1:13:06.200 --> 1:13:08.400
they've been giving you the runaround.

1:13:09.360 --> 1:13:13.519
And I've got a team of detectives
right now over at your office

1:13:13.560 --> 1:13:15.560
confiscating your assets.

1:13:15.600 --> 1:13:19.079
- You can't do that!
- Save it for a detective from Vice, love.

1:13:19.119 --> 1:13:23.560
Because if I'm proved right, that
little dalliance you had with Kelly,

1:13:23.600 --> 1:13:25.879
oh, that's the least of your worries!

1:14:10.360 --> 1:14:13.560
- Ma'am, have you got a second?
- Yes, Kenny.

1:14:13.600 --> 1:14:17.839
I've pulled out a couple of unsolved
burglaries in the Alnmouth area,

1:14:17.879 --> 1:14:20.600
the months leading up to
the China Farm murder.

1:14:21.759 --> 1:14:24.680
That pawnbroker was
questioned over one of them.

1:14:24.720 --> 1:14:27.039
- Handling stolen goods.
- Auntie Val?

1:14:27.079 --> 1:14:29.600
Yeah. A minor was also arrested.

1:14:29.639 --> 1:14:33.119
He was released without
charge. The record was wiped.

1:14:34.039 --> 1:14:35.879
But his name's still on the rap sheet.

1:14:35.920 --> 1:14:37.280
Nathan Weaver.

1:14:37.319 --> 1:14:40.079
But there's still nothing
to tie them to China Farm.

1:14:40.119 --> 1:14:42.479
Yeah, well, you just
hold that thought, Kenny.

1:14:42.519 --> 1:14:45.280
Have a look at that and
tell me what you see.

1:14:46.879 --> 1:14:48.319
Laura Thurston.

1:14:48.360 --> 1:14:51.959
Have a look at her hand
and tell me what you see.

1:14:52.000 --> 1:14:54.400
She's wearing the mourning ring!

1:14:56.079 --> 1:14:58.079
- You coming or what?
- Ma'am!

1:15:05.039 --> 1:15:08.759
You've known Nathan
Weaver for over 13 years.

1:15:08.800 --> 1:15:10.360
Yeah, I knew him.

1:15:10.400 --> 1:15:13.639
Him and every chancer that
ever walked through that door.

1:15:13.680 --> 1:15:16.519
The pair of you were questioned
over a series of burglaries.

1:15:16.560 --> 1:15:19.759
That was years ago. A misunderstanding.

1:15:19.800 --> 1:15:22.720
Does the name Laura Thurston
mean anything to you?

1:15:24.119 --> 1:15:27.280
- I can't say it does.
- Well, she was murdered.

1:15:27.319 --> 1:15:30.119
Just around the same
time as those burglaries.

1:15:31.159 --> 1:15:34.360
Oh, farmer's wife. He put
a bullet in her, didn't he?

1:15:34.400 --> 1:15:36.879
Oh, it's all coming
back to you now, is it?

1:15:37.879 --> 1:15:40.959
Nathan broke into that
farmhouse 13 years ago

1:15:41.000 --> 1:15:43.800
to steal jewellery for you to sell on.

1:15:43.839 --> 1:15:44.959
No.

1:15:45.000 --> 1:15:49.439
Well, you've already identified the
mourning ring, pet, Laura Thurston's ring,

1:15:49.479 --> 1:15:52.519
and that's evidence enough
to tie you to the murder.

1:15:52.560 --> 1:15:54.639
I didn't see any of it!

1:15:54.680 --> 1:15:58.039
He told me he'd just
dumped it all in the river.

1:16:13.000 --> 1:16:14.119
Ma'am.

1:16:14.159 --> 1:16:18.039
That inscription on that mourning
ring, "Let the truth guide me".

1:16:20.159 --> 1:16:21.759
Sorry, you've lost me, ma'am.

1:16:21.800 --> 1:16:25.400
What if it was Nathan who
killed that farmer's wife?

1:16:25.439 --> 1:16:27.360
Couldn't live with what he'd done.

1:16:28.119 --> 1:16:31.159
Kept that ring with him all
this time, cos he was grieving.

1:16:33.200 --> 1:16:33.800
Anything?

1:16:33.839 --> 1:16:36.680
We re-examined the area where
they found Laura's body.

1:16:36.720 --> 1:16:39.720
I ran some tests on that
window at the side of the house.

1:16:39.759 --> 1:16:42.079
There were some skin cells
snagged on the catch.

1:16:42.119 --> 1:16:43.560
Was it Nathan Weaver's?

1:16:43.600 --> 1:16:45.319
That's still inconclusive.

1:16:45.360 --> 1:16:48.319
The sample shared a significant
number of genetic markers.

1:16:48.360 --> 1:16:50.560
Yeah, well, it's gotta be him, hasn't it?

1:16:50.600 --> 1:16:52.720
Well, we could only
manage a partial profile.

1:16:52.759 --> 1:16:56.400
It could be Nathan's DNA, or just
somebody closely related to him.

1:16:56.439 --> 1:16:58.159
Well, there's only him and his mam,

1:16:58.200 --> 1:17:01.000
and I couldn't see her
shinning up any drainpipes!

1:17:02.920 --> 1:17:06.360
Unless there's more to
Dad than she's letting on.

1:17:15.879 --> 1:17:19.079
Just a couple more questions, Mrs Weaver.

1:17:20.239 --> 1:17:23.000
Nathan's dad, you said he took off.

1:17:23.039 --> 1:17:25.319
Something like that, yeah.

1:17:26.319 --> 1:17:29.800
- Nathan keep in touch with him?
- His dad didn't want to know.

1:17:30.800 --> 1:17:34.119
- Have you got an address?
- Maybe. Somewhere.

1:17:35.079 --> 1:17:37.079
But what's he got to do with all this?

1:17:38.079 --> 1:17:40.439
Why did he leave, if you
don't mind me asking?

1:17:40.479 --> 1:17:42.319
Another woman.

1:17:42.360 --> 1:17:45.079
He started seeing her
just after we got married.

1:17:45.119 --> 1:17:46.839
He even had a son with her.

1:17:46.879 --> 1:17:49.439
Clearly preferred him to Nathan.

1:17:49.479 --> 1:17:51.360
Nathan had a brother?

1:17:51.400 --> 1:17:52.800
Half-brother.

1:17:52.839 --> 1:17:55.720
- How can I get in touch
with him, love? - Joe?

1:17:55.759 --> 1:17:57.639
What do you want him for?

1:17:57.680 --> 1:17:59.200
Oh, just routine.

1:17:59.239 --> 1:18:01.639
So it's Joe Weaver, is it?

1:18:01.680 --> 1:18:03.959
No, he took his mam's name.

1:18:04.000 --> 1:18:06.200
- Connell.
- Thanks, love.

1:18:21.000 --> 1:18:22.839
I've answered all your questions.

1:18:22.879 --> 1:18:25.000
It's your foreman we're
after, Joe Connell.

1:18:25.039 --> 1:18:28.280
He's had the afternoon off. Said
he was going to the hospital.

1:18:30.680 --> 1:18:33.759
All units to Meldon Park Hospital.

1:18:45.360 --> 1:18:46.879
Let me get that.

1:19:04.959 --> 1:19:07.680
Get an ANPR on Joe's van.

1:19:07.720 --> 1:19:10.519
Look, I've gotta get you
away from Adam Gascoigne.

1:19:11.439 --> 1:19:13.280
I can't just take off. Not without Kyle.

1:19:13.319 --> 1:19:15.479
We'll come back for
Kyle once you're sorted.

1:19:15.519 --> 1:19:17.759
And how's it going to look,
me running out on him?

1:19:17.800 --> 1:19:20.879
You grassed, Kelly. You think
you're ever gonna be safe here?

1:19:21.680 --> 1:19:23.000
Go on.

1:19:27.479 --> 1:19:29.879
She checked herself out ten minutes ago.

1:19:30.400 --> 1:19:32.280
Well, she can't have gone far.

1:19:33.720 --> 1:19:35.959
We're looking for a Transit.

1:19:35.680 --> 1:19:38.959
- She said she'd protect me, that copper.
- You've got me to protect you.

1:19:39.000 --> 1:19:42.479
- It's what Nate would have wanted.
- Why would you care? You left him to rot.

1:19:42.519 --> 1:19:44.759
You and Kyle are all I've
got left of my brother.

1:19:44.800 --> 1:19:47.560
- Where are we going to go?
- Somewhere safe. Lie low for a bit.

1:19:47.600 --> 1:19:49.920
- Get in the van.
- This doesn't feel right.

1:19:49.959 --> 1:19:52.239
- Just do as you're told.
- I'm not going anywhere.

1:19:52.280 --> 1:19:55.079
- Get in the bloody van, Kelly!
- It's you they're after.

1:19:55.119 --> 1:19:56.639
- What have you done?
- Shut up.

1:19:56.680 --> 1:19:57.920
What did you do to him?

1:19:57.959 --> 1:20:00.280
- What did you do to him?
- Shut up!

1:20:10.280 --> 1:20:12.439
Hey! Joe! Hey!

1:20:13.439 --> 1:20:16.400
Joe Connell, I'm arresting you
for the murder of Nathan Weaver.

1:20:16.439 --> 1:20:20.720
Hey, it's all right, love.
It's all right, it's finished.

1:20:39.039 --> 1:20:41.800
When did you find out
your brother was dead?

1:20:42.800 --> 1:20:45.079
The day you turned up at the factory.

1:20:45.119 --> 1:20:48.039
It must have been a shock.
You didn't bat an eyelid.

1:20:49.560 --> 1:20:51.839
Nathan was bad news.

1:20:51.879 --> 1:20:55.360
So why did you wangle him a job at
the factory, if he was such bad news?

1:20:55.400 --> 1:20:58.879
He said he was desperate,
he needed the work.

1:20:59.879 --> 1:21:03.200
And all said and done,
he's still my brother.

1:21:03.239 --> 1:21:05.959
How long have you been
working at that factory?

1:21:06.879 --> 1:21:08.360
About 15 years.

1:21:08.400 --> 1:21:10.400
I started off as a driver.

1:21:10.439 --> 1:21:13.720
Did you ever pick up
supplies from China Farm?

1:21:14.720 --> 1:21:16.239
Eddie Thurston's place.

1:21:18.879 --> 1:21:22.200
I might have been there a few
times back in the day, I think.

1:21:23.360 --> 1:21:26.319
I think you went up there last week.

1:21:28.119 --> 1:21:29.959
Why would I do that?

1:21:30.879 --> 1:21:34.839
We found tyre tracks that
match your delivery van.

1:21:38.159 --> 1:21:39.280
Nah.

1:21:39.319 --> 1:21:41.720
Any one of the drivers could
have borrowed it, so...

1:21:41.759 --> 1:21:46.800
And Nathan called you
the night he was killed.

1:21:46.839 --> 1:21:48.639
Look, that's your number, isn't it?

1:21:49.439 --> 1:21:53.039
I haven't seen my brother
since he walked off the job.

1:21:53.079 --> 1:21:55.439
And we've got a witness,
heard you both arguing.

1:21:55.479 --> 1:21:59.839
We've got your shoeprints up on the bridge,
along with traces of Nathan's blood,

1:21:59.879 --> 1:22:03.239
and we've got your fingerprints
right along the safety rail.

1:22:03.280 --> 1:22:05.079
That doesn't mean I killed him.

1:22:05.119 --> 1:22:07.239
Ah, you admit you were there, then?

1:22:11.119 --> 1:22:14.879
And then you went after Kelly
to shut her up, didn't you?

1:22:14.920 --> 1:22:18.720
Because you were worried how
much Nathan might have told her.

1:22:20.119 --> 1:22:23.319
- About what?
- The China Farm murder.

1:22:26.360 --> 1:22:29.959
- I don't have to look at this.
- You cased that farmhouse, didn't you,

1:22:30.000 --> 1:22:32.479
while you were picking up
supplies for the factory?

1:22:32.519 --> 1:22:36.879
And then you went back later with
your brother to rob the place.

1:22:36.920 --> 1:22:40.519
You had a nice little scam going
on, targeting Bennick's suppliers.

1:22:40.560 --> 1:22:42.479
- Found yourself a fence.
- Ah, yeah.

1:22:42.519 --> 1:22:44.439
Auntie Val, she's confirmed it all.

1:22:44.479 --> 1:22:45.600
Oh...

1:22:45.639 --> 1:22:49.479
- If that's what she told you, she's lying.
- Oh, you know who she is, then?

1:22:51.119 --> 1:22:55.159
Then Eddie Thurston came home,
caught you threatening his wife,

1:22:55.200 --> 1:22:57.759
- and he came at you with a gun...
- I wasn't there!

1:22:57.800 --> 1:23:01.879
Oh, I think you were, love, because
we've got the DNA to prove it.

1:23:02.759 --> 1:23:05.439
And then Nathan grabs hold of the gun,

1:23:05.479 --> 1:23:09.159
and, in the scuffle, shoots Laura
Thurston where she's standing.

1:23:09.200 --> 1:23:13.039
- Thurston killed his wife!
- Except he didn't, did he, pet?

1:23:13.079 --> 1:23:14.560
Your brother shot her.

1:23:15.280 --> 1:23:17.600
And it haunted him, what he'd done.

1:23:17.639 --> 1:23:21.479
And when he finds out Eddie
Thurston's been refused parole,

1:23:21.519 --> 1:23:23.720
after all that time in prison,

1:23:23.759 --> 1:23:26.319
well, that sends him over the edge.

1:23:29.360 --> 1:23:32.119
It was the drugs. It was the
drugs that messed him up.

1:23:32.159 --> 1:23:36.720
- It just dragged us all down with him.
- Ah, well, at least he had a conscience.

1:23:36.759 --> 1:23:39.879
Nathan was a bloody liability!
It was me that looked out for him!

1:23:39.920 --> 1:23:42.639
It was always me! Thurston
would have killed him!

1:23:51.639 --> 1:23:55.200
It was you who grabbed
that gun, wasn't it?

1:23:57.000 --> 1:23:58.319
Not Nathan.

1:24:00.119 --> 1:24:01.280
Oh...

1:24:01.319 --> 1:24:02.439
It...

1:24:03.439 --> 1:24:04.560
It...

1:24:05.360 --> 1:24:06.920
It went off in my hand.

1:24:06.959 --> 1:24:12.119
And Laura Thurston took the bullet
that was meant for your brother.

1:24:12.159 --> 1:24:14.519
- I didn't mean to kill her.
- But you left her there.

1:24:14.560 --> 1:24:19.720
You legged it, the pair of you, and
let Eddie Thurston take the rap.

1:24:19.759 --> 1:24:21.319
Thurston was a bastard!

1:24:21.360 --> 1:24:23.519
He deserved locking up,
that was the end of it!

1:24:23.560 --> 1:24:26.959
It might have been the end of it
for you, but not your brother.

1:24:28.959 --> 1:24:32.400
He said he kept hearing
that gunshot in his head.

1:24:36.200 --> 1:24:37.800
It was an accident.

1:24:39.680 --> 1:24:41.560
So why did you shoot her twice?

1:24:45.839 --> 1:24:46.959
I didn't.

1:24:47.000 --> 1:24:49.920
It was just the once, like I told you.

1:24:52.800 --> 1:24:56.600
And then last week, on Wednesday
night, you went back up to that farm.

1:24:56.639 --> 1:24:58.200
Why did you do that?

1:24:59.839 --> 1:25:01.400
Right, Nathan called...

1:25:02.839 --> 1:25:04.959
.. he wasn't making any sense.

1:25:05.000 --> 1:25:08.200
God, he was off his
face on God knows what,

1:25:08.239 --> 1:25:13.479
and he said he'd spoken to a priest,
needed to do the right thing.

1:25:13.519 --> 1:25:17.039
- What, threatened to turn himself in?
- He had nothing to lose!

1:25:17.079 --> 1:25:20.119
So you picked up that
wrench and went after him.

1:25:20.159 --> 1:25:23.400
Murdered your brother
to save your own skin.

1:25:26.680 --> 1:25:31.720
But then how were you to know that that
shot you put into Laura Thurston...

1:25:32.560 --> 1:25:34.439
that didn't actually kill her?

1:25:48.519 --> 1:25:50.039
Mr Thurston.

1:25:51.680 --> 1:25:53.560
We're here to inform you

1:25:53.600 --> 1:25:58.720
that a Mr Joe Connell has testified
to accidentally shooting your wife.

1:25:58.759 --> 1:26:03.400
Claimed it happened during an
attempted burglary at your farm.

1:26:04.039 --> 1:26:06.759
And we need you to
corroborate his statement.

1:26:09.759 --> 1:26:11.400
Intruders.

1:26:11.439 --> 1:26:13.519
- Didn't I tell you?
- Aye!

1:26:14.759 --> 1:26:18.479
So what's the going rate
for wrongful conviction?

1:26:19.839 --> 1:26:25.119
You claim the gun was fired twice, but Mr
Connell claims the gun was fired only once,

1:26:25.159 --> 1:26:27.079
hitting your wife in the stomach.

1:26:27.119 --> 1:26:29.680
Well, clearly he was lying.

1:26:30.680 --> 1:26:36.319
We've spoken to Brian Bennick, the man
your wife was having an affair with,

1:26:36.360 --> 1:26:39.959
and his testimony backs up the
original prosecution's case.

1:26:40.000 --> 1:26:42.360
She was planning to leave you.

1:26:44.879 --> 1:26:47.879
Do you wanna know the truth
of what happened that night?

1:26:50.439 --> 1:26:52.759
Joe Connell didn't kill your wife.

1:26:53.759 --> 1:26:56.400
Although he spent 13
years thinking he had.

1:26:57.400 --> 1:27:01.000
She was wounded, but not fatally.

1:27:02.400 --> 1:27:05.479
And if they hadn't scarpered,
they'd have realised that.

1:27:07.920 --> 1:27:11.239
You could have saved her, if
you'd called an ambulance.

1:27:11.280 --> 1:27:14.200
- I did call an ambulance.
- Aye.

1:27:14.239 --> 1:27:18.239
But not before finishing
her cheating for good

1:27:18.280 --> 1:27:22.039
and emptying the second
barrel into her chest.

1:27:22.079 --> 1:27:24.439
What is this, another fit up?

1:27:26.400 --> 1:27:30.159
Your wife wasn't bleeding when you made
that call and neither was she breathing.

1:27:30.200 --> 1:27:32.079
She was already dead.

1:27:32.119 --> 1:27:33.400
Guilty as charged.

1:27:35.000 --> 1:27:37.200
You might wanna call that solicitor.

1:28:05.879 --> 1:28:08.800
I hear you've arrested Nathan's killer.

1:28:08.839 --> 1:28:12.920
Oh, aye. His brother, Joe Connell.
He's up in court in the morning.

1:28:12.959 --> 1:28:14.879
His brother?

1:28:16.479 --> 1:28:18.200
How much did Nathan tell you?

1:28:19.479 --> 1:28:21.119
Enough.

1:28:21.159 --> 1:28:24.560
I absolved him, told him he
had to be true to himself.

1:28:25.920 --> 1:28:27.360
Oh, if only I....

1:28:28.959 --> 1:28:30.800
Hey, the burden of guilt, eh?

1:28:32.000 --> 1:28:33.400
Weighs heavily.

1:28:35.680 --> 1:28:37.680
Easier not to dwell on things.
