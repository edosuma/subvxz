NARRATOR: In the criminal
justice system,

00:03.235 --> 00:06.865
sexually based offenses
are considered
especially heinous,

00:06.939 --> 00:08.066
In New York City,

00:08.141 --> 00:11.076
the dedicated detectives
who investigate
these vicious felonies

00:11.144 --> 00:14.636
are members
of an elite squad known
as the Special Victims Unit,

00:14.714 --> 00:16.648
These are their stories,

00:19.252 --> 00:24.121
Detective Stabler,
you stated under oath that
you tested everyone

00:24.190 --> 00:28.092
who had any personal contact
with Leslie Bello.

00:28.161 --> 00:29.992
Is that correct?
Yes.

00:30.063 --> 00:33.555
Did you test Mr. Hernandez,
her teacher?

00:34.267 --> 00:36.201
No.
No?

00:37.003 --> 00:39.767
Did you test her bus driver,
Mr. Campbell?

00:39.839 --> 00:41.170
No.

00:41.574 --> 00:44.600
Well, did you test the plumber
who fixed the bathroom drain

00:44.677 --> 00:47.737
when Leslie was home
sick from school?
No.

00:47.814 --> 00:49.179
So, in fact,

00:49.249 --> 00:52.275
everyone who could've
been alone with Leslie
was not tested.

00:52.352 --> 00:56.755
Leslie did not identify
the plumber as her rapist.

00:57.724 --> 01:01.023
And 8-year-olds,
they never Iie.
Objection.

01:01.094 --> 01:04.586
Withdrawn.
No further questions.

01:06.633 --> 01:08.430
Redirect, Your Honor.

01:09.869 --> 01:11.666
Detective Stabler,

01:11.738 --> 01:14.673
whom did Leslie Bello
identify as her rapist?

01:16.109 --> 01:19.078
Her grandfather,
Frederick Bello.

01:19.846 --> 01:21.279
Thank you.

01:35.829 --> 01:37.091
Was it scary?

01:37.163 --> 01:40.291
Piece of cake.
AII you gotta do
is tell the truth.

01:40.366 --> 01:42.027
Will you come with me?

01:42.102 --> 01:46.163
Well, you know, I can't,
but I'II wait right here
until you finish.

01:46.239 --> 01:47.706
Leslie Bello?

01:54.514 --> 01:56.414
Is he in there?

01:56.516 --> 01:59.747
Yeah, but he can't hurt you
anymore.

02:00.353 --> 02:02.048
Just Iook at the person
who's talking to you

02:02.122 --> 02:05.091
and answer their questions,
okay?

02:26.012 --> 02:27.604
Morning, EIIiot.

02:29.015 --> 02:31.210
Hey, how'd it go?

02:34.154 --> 02:37.385
They Iet him walk.
You're kidding me.

02:37.590 --> 02:39.922
Grandfather rapes
his granddaughter,
no big deal,

02:39.993 --> 02:42.860
even though he was
the only one in the house
with gonorrhea.

02:42.929 --> 02:45.659
Who the hell do they think
gave it to her?

02:45.732 --> 02:48.166
Juries screw up.

02:48.234 --> 02:51.726
Whole system's screwed up.
It's a Ioad of crap.

02:58.144 --> 02:59.668
MAN: It's a rape-homicide,

02:59.979 --> 03:01.708
Victim's Jennifer Walton, 25.

03:01.781 --> 03:04.147
The body was discovered
by her friend this morning.

03:04.217 --> 03:06.048
The Iandlady Iet her in.

03:06.119 --> 03:09.282
Any signs of forced entry?
No, but take a Iook.

03:11.958 --> 03:14.893
Did some damage.
That's only the beginning.

03:15.528 --> 03:17.155
(PEOPLE CHATTERING)

03:17.564 --> 03:19.031
How did it end?

03:19.098 --> 03:20.497
Found her tucked into bed,

03:20.567 --> 03:23.365
hands bound behind her back
with pantyhose,

03:23.436 --> 03:26.098
face pummeled,
throat slit and raped.

03:26.906 --> 03:28.271
Any fluids?

03:28.341 --> 03:30.969
Too much blood to tell,
but there is
perineal bruising.

03:31.044 --> 03:34.138
We'II test the sheets
for semen.
FIN: Look at this.

03:35.281 --> 03:37.044
A romantic psycho.

03:38.918 --> 03:41.819
And I thought my day
couldn't get any worse.

04:36.409 --> 04:39.810
MUNCH: How do you spell that?
EDNA: D-U-M-A-S.

04:40.413 --> 04:43.814
How well did you
know Jennifer?
We're both dog Iovers.

04:43.883 --> 04:47.182
We'd exchange stories
sometimes at the dog run.

04:47.287 --> 04:49.050
Did she ever mention
a boyfriend?

04:49.122 --> 04:50.783
Last month she said

04:50.857 --> 04:54.793
she was going away
for a weekend with
someone named David.

04:54.861 --> 04:57.955
She asked me to take care
of her Iittle puppy, Max.

04:58.698 --> 05:02.429
I bet he wants his breakfast.
Did you ever meet this David?

05:02.502 --> 05:04.265
Well, not formally,

05:04.337 --> 05:09.036
but I saw him sometimes
standing outside her door

05:09.108 --> 05:11.599
right there.
What's he Iook Iike?

05:12.245 --> 05:15.339
Tall, graying hair.

05:15.415 --> 05:17.542
He brought her flowers,
so I figured it was him.

05:17.617 --> 05:18.914
What kind of flowers?

05:18.985 --> 05:23.251
Begonias and daisies,
roses.

05:23.323 --> 05:25.188
He stop by Iast night?

05:26.025 --> 05:29.483
I think they were fighting.
About what?

05:29.696 --> 05:30.958
He was yelling so Ioud.

05:31.030 --> 05:34.898
Something about
she was trying
to ruin his Iife.

05:34.967 --> 05:38.061
I should've
checked up on her.

05:38.905 --> 05:40.099
(DOG WHINING)

05:40.506 --> 05:43.168
STABLER: What store?
Wheaton's Department Store.

05:43.242 --> 05:44.903
We planned to meet for drinks.

05:44.977 --> 05:47.070
When?
Around 9:00.

05:47.146 --> 05:48.636
8:30 she called my cell,

05:48.715 --> 05:50.842
said a friend
stopped by from work
and she'd be Iate.

05:50.917 --> 05:52.077
She mention a name?

05:52.151 --> 05:55.177
No, but I heard
a man's voice
in the background.

05:55.254 --> 05:57.154
What'd it sound Iike?

05:59.759 --> 06:02.319
Did he have an accent?
Did he sound angry?

06:02.395 --> 06:04.886
I don't know.
What about Jennifer?

06:05.598 --> 06:07.498
Was she upset,
nervous?

06:07.967 --> 06:09.434
I'm not sure.

06:09.902 --> 06:13.167
Is there anything
you're sure about?
We only talked for a moment.

06:13.239 --> 06:14.433
EIIiot.

06:15.808 --> 06:17.469
We'II be in touch.

06:20.279 --> 06:21.940
Looks Iike
she was entertaining.

06:22.014 --> 06:24.278
One glass with Iipstick.
Our perp a teetotaler?

06:24.350 --> 06:25.374
Neat freak.

06:25.451 --> 06:27.578
Found the other glass
in the kitchen
on the drying rack

06:27.653 --> 06:30.417
along with a carving knife,
both washed totally clean.

06:30.490 --> 06:33.482
So much for evidence.
Well, we've got blood.

06:34.927 --> 06:36.895
Probably Ianded
the first blow here.

06:36.963 --> 06:40.763
Then he dragged her
from the couch
into the bedroom.

06:41.501 --> 06:44.436
STABLER: Surprised he didn't
shampoo the rug.

06:44.504 --> 06:46.802
Victim's clothes
folded nice and neat.

06:47.540 --> 06:51.636
Buttons are all gone.
After he ripped them
from her body.

06:52.478 --> 06:53.968
Bag them all.

06:54.981 --> 06:57.279
There's no sign of
a struggle here.

06:57.350 --> 07:01.081
The blow must've stunned her,
maybe even knocked her out.

07:01.154 --> 07:03.315
So, he Iays her on the bed,
and he ties her up.

07:03.389 --> 07:05.414
He beats her
and he rapes her.

07:05.758 --> 07:07.692
I'd say you're Iooking
for a Iefty.

07:07.760 --> 07:10.854
He drew the blade
across her throat,
slicing the Ieft carotid,

07:10.930 --> 07:12.522
sending the spray
against the wall.

07:12.598 --> 07:15.032
Kitchen knife Iooks
good for the weapon.

07:15.101 --> 07:18.730
When he's finished with her,
heads for the bathroom.

07:19.305 --> 07:21.637
Hey.
Hey. Found traces of blood
in the sink

07:21.707 --> 07:23.834
and also around
the shower drain.

07:23.910 --> 07:25.400
Okay.

07:25.478 --> 07:28.106
So, he showers.
He gets dressed.

07:28.181 --> 07:30.945
He washes the wine glass
and the knife,

07:31.017 --> 07:35.249
strolls out the front door,
takes his dirty towels
with him.

07:35.321 --> 07:38.757
You got it all figured out.
At Ieast I'm trying.

07:40.059 --> 07:43.859
Check the drain traps.
Hear that?
Get the tub and the sink.

07:44.397 --> 07:46.092
You're thinking
crime of passion?

07:46.165 --> 07:48.929
Really did a number on her.
Hell of a Iot of rage.

07:49.001 --> 07:50.901
But he wasn't out of control.

07:50.970 --> 07:53.632
Still had the presence of mind
to clean up after himself.

07:53.706 --> 07:56.869
Maybe that's because
the violence is actually
soothing to him.

07:56.943 --> 07:59.912
You see, the initial outburst
triggers a flood of serotonin
to his brain,

07:59.979 --> 08:01.571
which calms him
while he acts out his anger.

08:01.647 --> 08:03.171
The more he maims,
the better he feels.

08:03.249 --> 08:05.149
Exactly, and then once
his rage dissipates,

08:05.218 --> 08:07.584
he's gentle, he's Ioving.
He tucks her into bed.

08:07.653 --> 08:10.053
He folds her clothes,
puts a flower on her pillow.

08:10.122 --> 08:12.056
So, what are we
Iooking for?

08:12.124 --> 08:13.591
Well, he wooed her
before he killed her.

08:13.659 --> 08:17.220
He's intelligent, articulate,
maybe even charming.

08:17.296 --> 08:19.389
Any Ieads on the boyfriend?

08:22.535 --> 08:27.029
EIIiot and I are heading
to Wheaton's to follow up
on her visitor from work.

08:27.139 --> 08:29.972
Munch, Fin,
stick with forensics.

08:30.042 --> 08:31.600
As meticulous
as this guy was,

08:31.677 --> 08:34.976
Iet's hope he Ieft something
behind in all that carnage.

08:35.047 --> 08:37.607
Multiple facial
and mandibular fractures.

08:37.683 --> 08:40.811
Knocked out four front teeth,
two embedded
in the soft palate.

08:40.886 --> 08:42.217
Any idea what
he beat her with?

08:42.288 --> 08:44.256
His fists,
by the bruise patterns.

08:44.323 --> 08:46.223
He could have cut himself
on a broken tooth.

08:46.292 --> 08:49.853
I'II canvas the ERs
for hand injuries.
Anything else?

08:49.929 --> 08:53.421
Traces of spermicide,
most Iikely from a condom,
but no semen,

08:53.499 --> 08:55.023
and something odd.

08:55.101 --> 08:58.628
Two circular incisions
on her chest
where the dermis was excised.

08:58.704 --> 09:00.763
What's his game?
I don't know,

09:00.840 --> 09:04.571
but the hell
this woman went through,
death was a blessing.

09:08.514 --> 09:10.277
DARCY: You gotta find
whoever did this,

09:10.349 --> 09:12.715
We're Iooking for someone
who might be able to help.

09:12.785 --> 09:16.482
A guy by the name of David.
You mean David Stedman?

09:16.556 --> 09:18.990
He work here?
He's the manager
in Women's Shoes.

09:19.058 --> 09:20.855
Were he
and Jenny involved?

09:20.927 --> 09:24.385
He's a married man.
Not that it ever stopped him.

09:24.897 --> 09:27.365
Stopped him from what?
Chasing women.

09:27.433 --> 09:31.096
He's shameless.
Even after Tammy filed
that harassment suit.

09:31.170 --> 09:33.900
Who's Tammy?
She worked in Cosmetics.

09:33.973 --> 09:36.942
She told him
she had a boyfriend,
but he wouldn't back off.

09:37.009 --> 09:39.807
She finally had to transfer
to the Brooklyn store.

09:39.879 --> 09:42.006
Is that when David
turned his attentions
to Jenny?

09:42.081 --> 09:43.173
Yeah.

09:43.249 --> 09:47.117
He started
coming around on breaks,
asking her to Iunch.

09:47.954 --> 09:49.785
I warned her,

09:50.256 --> 09:54.556
but she insisted
they were just friends.
But you didn't believe that?

09:54.627 --> 09:58.256
It's impossible for David
to be "just friends"
with a woman.

09:59.065 --> 10:00.828
Is he working today?

10:01.434 --> 10:03.994
Up the escalator
and on your right.

10:05.605 --> 10:08.540
Look what this shoe does
for the Iine of your Ieg.

10:09.208 --> 10:12.575
Very sexy.
I don't know.
They're awfully expensive.

10:13.179 --> 10:14.942
But you're worth it.

10:15.047 --> 10:16.981
David Stedman?
Be right with you.

10:17.049 --> 10:19.108
We'd Iike to talk to you now.
I'm with a customer.

10:19.185 --> 10:22.586
She'II understand.
I think you better
talk to them.

10:25.791 --> 10:28.658
What happened to your hand?
I broke a knuckle.

10:28.728 --> 10:29.786
How?

10:31.330 --> 10:33.423
Banged it against a door.

10:36.836 --> 10:39.361
She really must have
pissed you off.

10:39.672 --> 10:41.697
Who?
Jennifer Walton.

10:41.774 --> 10:44.174
Neighbor saw you
go into the apartment,
heard you two arguing.

10:44.243 --> 10:47.542
You get off
on beating up women?
Make you feel good?

10:48.114 --> 10:51.675
I never touched her.
BENSON: Well, we saw
the hole in the door.

10:51.984 --> 10:55.920
Is that what this is about?
'Cause I'II pay for
the damned door, okay?

10:55.988 --> 10:58.388
What set you off there,
shoe boy?

11:00.092 --> 11:02.822
She was gonna file
a complaint with my boss.

11:02.895 --> 11:04.123
She said I was harassing her.

11:04.196 --> 11:07.757
That's a bad habit of yours,
harassing the Iadies,
isn't it?

11:07.933 --> 11:10.026
I only asked her to dinner.

11:11.537 --> 11:13.164
You murdered her.

11:15.374 --> 11:16.466
What?

11:17.943 --> 11:19.308
She's dead?

11:19.945 --> 11:21.913
No more dancing.
EIIiot.

11:21.981 --> 11:24.211
You tried to get
into her pants,
and she wouldn't go for it,

11:24.283 --> 11:25.614
so you smacked her.
No.

11:25.685 --> 11:27.812
No? Then, tell me
what happened, huh?
EIIiot.

11:27.887 --> 11:29.013
Huh? Just tell me
what happened.

11:29.088 --> 11:30.385
She Iaughed at you,
'cause you couldn't
get it up?

11:30.456 --> 11:31.480
No!
EIIiot, knock it off.

11:31.557 --> 11:32.546
She made fun of
your manhood,

11:32.625 --> 11:35.219
and then you decided
to teach her a Iesson,
so you pounded it into her,

11:35.294 --> 11:37.319
and then you raped her
and you sliced her throat.

11:37.396 --> 11:38.420
No, I punched her door.
EIIiot.

11:38.497 --> 11:41.261
You raped her.
You sliced her throat.
She threw me out, I swear.

11:41.333 --> 11:42.800
What time?
Yeah.

11:42.868 --> 11:45.701
7:00.
No, witness puts you there
at 8:30.

11:46.672 --> 11:48.230
No.

11:48.307 --> 11:51.003
No. I was at the hospital
by 8:00.

11:51.077 --> 11:54.535
You don't believe me,
call the ER at Mercy General.

12:00.352 --> 12:02.877
What are you doing?
You itching for a Iawsuit?

12:02.955 --> 12:06.447
Just cutting through the crap.
He's calling his Iawyer.

12:06.525 --> 12:10.188
Well, God bless the Iawyers.
EIIiot, hey,
it's my ass, too.

12:10.262 --> 12:13.459
Don't worry about it.
I'II make sure it's covered.

12:17.369 --> 12:21.465
David Stedman,
signed in 7:47 p.m.,
discharged 1 2:52 a.m.

12:21.540 --> 12:23.599
What took so Iong?
It's a busy night.

12:23.676 --> 12:26.201
And he would've gotten in
sooner if he hadn't kept
hitting on me.

12:26.278 --> 12:27.404
I saw his wedding ring.

12:27.480 --> 12:29.778
Every time he made a move,
I dropped him
to the bottom of the Iist.

12:29.849 --> 12:31.373
Great.

12:32.284 --> 12:33.649
Thank you.

12:34.687 --> 12:36.746
So, we start over.

12:37.757 --> 12:40.726
Face pummeled, 5-inch Iac
to the throat.
How deep?

12:40.793 --> 12:44.889
Carotid partially severed.
BP thready. 70 palp.
Ran four units of saline.

12:44.964 --> 12:46.625
WOMAN: Take her to 3.

12:47.633 --> 12:49.362
We're on it.
What?

12:49.602 --> 12:51.001
That was Munch calling
from the crime scene.

12:51.070 --> 12:53.698
I think we just met
victim number two.

12:54.840 --> 12:57.638
(WOMAN CHATTERING
OVER PA SYSTEM)

13:03.082 --> 13:07.610
Celia Mitchum, second victim,
25, teacher's aide
at Thornton EIementary.

13:07.686 --> 13:09.711
Landlord found her
tucked into bed,

13:09.789 --> 13:12.451
hands tied, face beaten,
throat cut.

13:12.525 --> 13:14.891
After which
the perp took a shower,
did the dishes

13:14.960 --> 13:18.327
and Ieft a white rose
on her pillow.
Just Iike the other one.

13:18.397 --> 13:19.591
Have you seen this MO before?

13:19.665 --> 13:21.690
Not around here.
We're checking with VICAP.

13:21.767 --> 13:25.168
He's got his act down.
He's too organized
to be a first-timer.

13:25.237 --> 13:28.104
And he knows what he Iikes,
blonde, blue eyes, petite,

13:28.174 --> 13:30.665
both worked with children.
Mother fixation?

13:30.743 --> 13:32.404
I'd say more Iike
a romantic ideal.

13:32.478 --> 13:34.742
He shared a bottle of wine
with Jennifer.
He Iit a candle.

13:34.814 --> 13:36.042
What about Celia?

13:36.115 --> 13:38.345
Having coffee,
munching on some chocolates.

13:38.417 --> 13:40.681
Don't forget the roses.
White roses.

13:40.753 --> 13:42.846
The symbol of innocence
and purity.

13:42.922 --> 13:45.482
Unfortunately, no woman
fulfills his fantasy.

13:45.558 --> 13:49.494
So, his frustration
just keeps escalating until
he can't contain himself.

13:49.562 --> 13:50.688
What else?

13:50.763 --> 13:53.596
He tailors his approach.
Wine for Jennifer,
chocolates for Celia.

13:53.666 --> 13:56.328
This means that
he studied them.
He possibly knew them.

13:56.402 --> 14:00.270
He's white, educated,
probably middle-management.

14:00.339 --> 14:02.967
Why didn't you pick up
on this before?

14:03.275 --> 14:06.836
'Cause the pattern
didn't emerge until
the second victim.

14:07.379 --> 14:08.539
How Iong's he
been doing it?

14:08.614 --> 14:11.276
Long enough to perfect
a pretty sophisticated MO.

14:11.350 --> 14:12.977
Five, maybe 10 years.

14:13.052 --> 14:16.613
You'II have to go a hell of
a Iot farther back than that.

14:17.790 --> 14:18.984
HAWKINS: EIIiot.

14:19.358 --> 14:22.657
John. What do you need?
A few minutes with your boss.

14:22.728 --> 14:24.355
Detective Hawkins?
Captain Cragen.

14:24.430 --> 14:27.661
Come on in. EIIiot, join us.

14:27.733 --> 14:29.598
Who the hell is that?

14:30.669 --> 14:32.034
Wyatt Earp.

14:36.609 --> 14:38.099
Shut the door.

14:39.378 --> 14:42.313
You two know each other?
I took his class
at the Academy.

14:42.381 --> 14:45.350
AIways had him
figured for Homicide.
I guess he had other ideas.

14:45.417 --> 14:46.611
What's this about?

14:46.685 --> 14:50.121
Detective Hawkins has
some information he thinks
bears on your serial killer.

14:50.189 --> 14:51.281
Okay.

14:51.891 --> 14:54.223
You remember
the SoHo Strangler?

14:54.426 --> 14:56.155
Roger Berry, early '80s.

14:56.228 --> 14:58.287
Beat and raped his victims,
and then he strangled them.

14:58.364 --> 15:00.832
You put him away.
He's out.

15:00.900 --> 15:02.800
Paroled six months ago.

15:03.035 --> 15:05.401
Well, our guy doesn't
squeeze their throats.
He cuts them.

15:05.471 --> 15:06.768
Tucks them into bed?
Yeah.

15:06.839 --> 15:09.467
Leaves a white rose
on their pillow?
Okay, maybe we got a copycat.

15:09.541 --> 15:10.530
I wouldn't count on it.

15:10.609 --> 15:12.600
We never released
that Iittle detail
about the rose

15:12.678 --> 15:15.272
or the fact that
he tied his victims' wrists
with a Navy slipknot.

15:15.347 --> 15:17.474
Berry was a biter.
Still is.

15:17.549 --> 15:19.278
Only now he cuts the bite
marks off their chests,

15:19.351 --> 15:21.512
so you can't match them
to his dental records.

15:21.587 --> 15:23.487
Roger's had a few years
to sweat the details.

15:23.555 --> 15:26.046
Okay, well, thanks a Iot.
We'II check it out.

15:26.125 --> 15:27.922
You can ride with me.

15:32.264 --> 15:33.697
Brass called this morning.

15:33.766 --> 15:36.098
Detective Hawkins
has a Iot of experience
with Berry.

15:36.168 --> 15:38.466
He's been temporarily
reassigned here.

15:39.238 --> 15:43.299
Oh, so, now I need
a babysitter?
It's no reflection on you.

15:43.943 --> 15:46.810
This isn't right, Captain.
It's how it is.

15:46.879 --> 15:47.937
Yeah.

15:50.382 --> 15:53.374
His name's Roger Berry.
I miss one
damn parole hearing,

15:53.452 --> 15:55.181
and the morons Iet him
walk on good behavior.

15:55.254 --> 15:58.815
I see you've met everybody.
Hawk's a real take-charge
kind of guy.

15:58.891 --> 16:01.860
What makes you think
it's Berry?
Fits his signature.

16:01.927 --> 16:04.589
I read up on the first victim.
What've you got on the second?

16:04.663 --> 16:08.190
Scene wiped clean,
except for a contact Iens
on the bathroom floor.

16:08.267 --> 16:11.964
Victim's med records
says she's 20/20.
Roger's got Iousy eyesight.

16:12.037 --> 16:14.062
Where exactly do we
find this Roger?

16:14.139 --> 16:16.903
His PO's got him working
at a flower shop on 32nd.

16:16.976 --> 16:19.171
They sell white roses?
Check it out.

16:19.244 --> 16:21.974
BENSON: Benson. Yeah.
We'II take Roger's apartment.

16:22.047 --> 16:25.073
Okay. That was the Iab
with forensics.
So, go.

16:25.150 --> 16:28.415
EIIiot and I can take
care of ourselves, can't we?

16:31.223 --> 16:33.987
Coffee cups, chocolates,
roses, silverware.

16:34.059 --> 16:37.153
Wasn't able to get anything.
Same nothing
as the first crime scene.

16:37.229 --> 16:39.789
He did use the same
Navy slipknot on both victims.

16:39.865 --> 16:42.095
What about the contact Iens?
Contact Iens.

16:42.167 --> 16:44.158
Whoever Iost it is Iucky
he didn't walk into any walls.

16:44.236 --> 16:47.034
We calibrated the prescription
at 20/150.

16:47.106 --> 16:48.266
Any DNA on it?

16:48.340 --> 16:51.969
No, but we found hair samples
in the drain traps
from both apartments.

16:52.044 --> 16:55.172
They didn't belong
to either victim,
but they matched each other.

16:55.247 --> 16:56.339
The killer.

16:56.415 --> 16:58.315
Good news is the barb
was still attached
to one of them.

16:58.384 --> 16:59.373
If there's enough DNA,

16:59.451 --> 17:01.248
we can run it against
the sample they took
from Roger Berry

17:01.320 --> 17:04.686
when he was paroled.
Now all we have to do
is find him.

17:04.757 --> 17:05.746
See you.

17:09.060 --> 17:11.393
Your partner
always so friendly?

17:11.463 --> 17:13.624
Well, she just
doesn't Iike you.

17:13.699 --> 17:15.826
Wail till she gets to know me.

17:15.901 --> 17:17.266
Here we go.

17:18.270 --> 17:21.535
Hey, Roger,
it's your old buddy, Hawk.
Open up.

17:21.607 --> 17:23.871
Roger. Probably out
walking his dog.

17:25.377 --> 17:28.778
You got a warrant?
Don't need one.
PO's prerogative.

17:32.017 --> 17:33.507
Well, I don't see
a parole officer,

17:33.585 --> 17:36.053
unless that drunk
we stepped over
has got a badge.

17:36.121 --> 17:37.611
He'II be here.

17:39.191 --> 17:42.160
You sure
this is Roger's apartment?
Oh, yeah.

17:42.227 --> 17:44.752
Yeah, well, our shrink said
our guy's middle-management.

17:44.830 --> 17:46.297
Oh, he did, did he?
Oh, he did,

17:46.365 --> 17:49.300
and he also said that
he's meticulous.
Meticulous?

17:49.835 --> 17:53.134
Check the bed.
Hospital corners.

17:54.039 --> 17:58.339
"Happy birthday. Love, Mom."
We got a pair
of running shoes.

17:58.410 --> 18:00.844
You think she knew
we were coming?

18:01.580 --> 18:04.549
Well, well, Iookie here.

18:05.417 --> 18:08.944
Guess he didn't have time
to put them in his scrapbook.

18:09.021 --> 18:11.455
Jennifer Walton
and Celia Mitchum.

18:12.591 --> 18:15.560
You're Iate.
Hey, cross-town traffic's
a bitch.

18:15.627 --> 18:17.959
Detective Stabler,
Eddie Tobias, Roger's PO.

18:18.030 --> 18:20.362
How you doing?
Where's our boy?

18:20.432 --> 18:22.423
You were supposed
to be keeping track of him.

18:22.501 --> 18:25.163
He wasn't at work today.
Home was the next best bet.

18:25.237 --> 18:26.864
When he's in trouble,
he usually runs to Mama.

18:26.939 --> 18:29.237
She still in that shotgun
house out in Queens?

18:29.308 --> 18:31.742
Couldn't pry her out
with a crowbar.

18:31.810 --> 18:34.506
The neighbors tried to
when they found out
what her Iittle boy did.

18:34.580 --> 18:37.572
Thanks, Eddie.
CIose the door
on your way out.

18:38.317 --> 18:40.217
(CAR DOOR CLOSING)

18:40.686 --> 18:41.744
You.

18:42.121 --> 18:44.555
That's right, Mrs. Berry.
It's me.

18:45.257 --> 18:46.747
I got nothing to say.

18:46.825 --> 18:49.988
Your boy's at it again.
He raped and killed
two more women.

18:50.062 --> 18:53.054
You're trespassing.
Where is he?

18:53.132 --> 18:56.659
I'm not gonna Iet you
railroad him
Iike you did before.

18:56.735 --> 18:57.997
Roger confessed.

18:58.070 --> 19:00.834
You tricked him.
He didn't know
what he was doing.

19:00.906 --> 19:02.373
He knew exactly
what he was doing.

19:02.441 --> 19:05.137
You stole 18 years
of his Iife.

19:05.844 --> 19:07.209
(COUGHING)

19:10.282 --> 19:12.682
Ma'am, he surrenders himself,
he gets a fair shake.

19:12.751 --> 19:15.777
I give you my word.
You're all Iiars!

19:15.854 --> 19:20.791
I find out you're hiding him
again, I'II run you in
for accessory after the fact.

19:22.427 --> 19:24.224
You don't scare me.

19:24.596 --> 19:27.156
It's gonna be a Iot easier
if you give him up now.

19:27.232 --> 19:29.928
Roger keeps running,
he's Iiable to get hurt.

19:30.002 --> 19:31.367
Go to hell!

19:34.239 --> 19:37.367
You trying to kill her?
No. She's tougher
than she Iooks.

19:37.442 --> 19:40.104
Last time, she hid Roger
in her basement
for three weeks,

19:40.179 --> 19:42.113
meanwhile two more women
wound up dead.

19:42.181 --> 19:45.344
Sure as hell
ain't gonna help us now.
You think she would?

19:45.417 --> 19:49.012
Sometimes finesse
goes a Iong way.
Finesse is for fairies.

19:49.087 --> 19:51.681
Look, I don't care
how many strings
you pulled to get here,

19:51.757 --> 19:53.554
but you're working my case.

19:53.859 --> 19:55.121
My case.

19:55.827 --> 19:58.728
So, from now on,
we do it my way,
you got that?

19:58.797 --> 20:01.425
You hungry?
What?

20:01.500 --> 20:04.230
Roger used to eat
at this restaurant every day
about the same time.

20:04.303 --> 20:06.396
Thought we'd grab a bite.

20:07.773 --> 20:08.899
You hear me?
Yeah.

20:08.974 --> 20:12.307
But if I don't get something
in my gut before Iong,
I'm gonna pass out.

20:12.377 --> 20:13.708
You drive.

20:15.480 --> 20:16.572
(CAR DOOR CLOSING)

20:19.818 --> 20:21.285
Oh, yeah. Roger.

20:21.353 --> 20:23.719
He started coming in
a few months back.

20:23.789 --> 20:27.520
Orders the same dinner.
Cheeseburger and a root beer.

20:27.593 --> 20:29.686
Takes it to
his favorite table.

20:29.761 --> 20:31.786
STABLER: Yeah, he's got
a standing reservation?

20:31.863 --> 20:34.354
Well, you know,
he's a Iittle off.

20:34.433 --> 20:37.527
It's gotta be that table
or nothing. He'II wait an hour
for people to Ieave.

20:37.603 --> 20:40.572
So, I put a Iittle sign up,
save him the trouble.

20:40.639 --> 20:43.608
How are the cheeseburgers,
still the same?
Big and greasy.

20:43.675 --> 20:46.200
HAWKINS: I'II take two.
One for me
and one for my partner.

20:46.278 --> 20:48.269
My treat.
To drink?

20:48.347 --> 20:50.508
Double bourbon. Neat.

20:50.582 --> 20:52.777
Beer. A bottle of domestic.

20:53.752 --> 20:56.414
We'II have our burgers,
nail our perp and be home
for the 11:00 news.

20:56.488 --> 20:59.651
You're awfully cocky
for someone who's been
striking out all day.

20:59.725 --> 21:02.125
Well, Roger's a creature
of habit. He'II be here.

21:02.194 --> 21:03.821
Whatever you say.

21:05.831 --> 21:08.459
You wanna talk about
that bug up your ass
or just Iet it fester?

21:08.533 --> 21:10.831
I just don't Iike
grandstanders.

21:10.902 --> 21:13.894
I thought you were gonna
say grandfathers.

21:18.343 --> 21:20.538
That was a tough one to Iose.

21:21.880 --> 21:25.145
That jury sent him home
to rape that kid
all over again.

21:25.217 --> 21:27.845
You make your case?
I had him nailed.

21:28.353 --> 21:30.218
Then you did your job.

21:31.189 --> 21:33.783
Well, that's not good
enough anymore.
Well, it has to be,

21:33.859 --> 21:35.986
because that's all there is.

21:38.597 --> 21:41.725
I told that Iittle girl
everything was gonna be okay.

21:41.800 --> 21:45.031
And I told the parents
of Roger's victims
he'd rot in prison.

21:45.103 --> 21:46.730
Well,
at Ieast you put him
away for 18.

21:46.805 --> 21:50.263
Yeah, well, at Ieast
you gave that Iittle girl
a few days' peace.

21:50.342 --> 21:52.606
We never win this war, EIIiot.

21:54.880 --> 21:57.007
(SIGHING)
Just so tired of Iosing.

21:59.851 --> 22:01.876
Then what're you gonna do?

22:02.087 --> 22:03.076
Huh?

22:03.221 --> 22:04.381
Quit?

22:07.859 --> 22:09.326
I don't know.

22:11.963 --> 22:16.297
AII that's required for evil
to triumph is for good men
to do nothing.

22:16.935 --> 22:18.926
Here's to a few good men.

22:19.738 --> 22:21.535
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

22:26.311 --> 22:28.336

22:31.650 --> 22:32.639
STABLER: Really?

22:33.285 --> 22:36.516
Well, we'II Iet you know
if he shows up here.

22:36.588 --> 22:38.283
Wasn't a total bust
at the flower shop.

22:38.357 --> 22:40.689
The owner told Munch
that Roger made deliveries

22:40.759 --> 22:43.728
to Jennifer Walton's
apartment building a week
before she was murdered.

22:43.795 --> 22:45.990
That's the way
he accessed his victims
Iast time around.

22:46.064 --> 22:49.864
He also said that
Roger got fired
for threatening a customer.

22:50.702 --> 22:51.896
Our boy's Iate.

22:51.970 --> 22:54.404
Sometimes he gets caught up
watching the boats.

22:54.473 --> 22:56.600
Yeah, where?
Pier 41.

22:57.642 --> 22:58.734
Damn.

23:01.847 --> 23:04.247
Hey, who's gonna pay for this?

23:27.973 --> 23:29.304
Roger?

23:30.008 --> 23:31.737
It's me, Hawk.

23:32.677 --> 23:36.078
Turn around real slow,
and we'II handle this
Iike men, all right?

23:36.148 --> 23:39.549
Stay away from me.
Can't do that, Roger.

23:39.785 --> 23:43.346
I won't go back there.
That's not an option, Roger.

23:45.223 --> 23:47.282
No.
Roger.

23:48.126 --> 23:49.525
I won't.

23:50.195 --> 23:51.492
No.

23:53.632 --> 23:54.690
(GRUNTING)

23:54.766 --> 23:56.529
Come on, Roger.
No, I won't go back!

23:56.601 --> 23:58.159
Get up.
No!

24:00.906 --> 24:02.464
Damn it, Roger.

24:02.774 --> 24:04.071
(GRUNTING)

24:04.142 --> 24:05.507
Hold still.

24:05.610 --> 24:06.907
(ROGER GASPING)

24:06.978 --> 24:08.377
Your collar.

24:09.848 --> 24:11.110
Roger Berry,

24:11.183 --> 24:15.347
you're under arrest for
the murders of Jennifer Walton
and Celia Mitchum.

24:15.720 --> 24:17.381
No.
You have the right
to remain silent.

24:17.456 --> 24:18.445
No.

24:18.523 --> 24:21.356
If you give up that right,
anything you say can...

24:23.261 --> 24:27.163
We almost Iost you, there,
Roger.
I don't want to talk to you.

24:27.232 --> 24:28.392
I don't really want to
talk to you, either,

24:28.467 --> 24:30.401
but we've got some Ioose ends
we gotta tie up.

24:30.469 --> 24:32.869
Where were you
night before Iast?

24:33.505 --> 24:37.066
It was my birthday.
I was with my mother.
AII night?

24:37.709 --> 24:40.610
After we ate cake,
I went home.
What time?

24:40.946 --> 24:42.436
Lights out by 10:00.

24:42.514 --> 24:45.244
You stop by Celia Mitchum's
on the way home?

24:45.317 --> 24:46.375
Who's that?

24:46.451 --> 24:49.386
That's that nice Iady
you brought flowers to
day before yesterday.

24:49.454 --> 24:51.445
I bring flowers
to Iots of nice Iadies.

24:51.523 --> 24:54.219
Yeah, but this one
you killed, Roger.

24:54.659 --> 24:55.683
No.

24:56.294 --> 24:59.627
(CLEARS THROAT)
What about Jennifer Walton?
I didn't kill anybody.

24:59.865 --> 25:03.596
Then why'd you cut their
stories out of the paper?
See here?

25:04.169 --> 25:05.727
My mom gave me those.

25:05.804 --> 25:08.864
She said, "Be careful."
You was gonna try
to put me back in jail.

25:08.940 --> 25:11.272
Roger, you're not going back
if you didn't do it.

25:11.343 --> 25:14.506
You Iie just Iike he Iied.
Here we go.

25:14.946 --> 25:17.176
You said
if I signed that paper,
I could go home.

25:17.249 --> 25:19.979
We don't send murderers home,
we send them to prison.

25:20.051 --> 25:22.542
Now, admit it, Roger,
you took those girls flowers.

25:22.621 --> 25:24.179
No.
You pretended to be
their friend...

25:24.256 --> 25:26.019
No. No.
...and then you raped them
and killed them.

25:26.091 --> 25:27.251
No!

25:31.196 --> 25:32.458
(SOBBING)

25:32.531 --> 25:34.192
I want my mom.

25:34.266 --> 25:36.757
Your mama can't help you now,
boy.
Hawk.

25:36.835 --> 25:39.269
You're going back to jail,
and this time
I'm gonna see to it

25:39.337 --> 25:41.771
they strap you down
and put a needle in your arm.

25:41.840 --> 25:42.864
No.

25:43.708 --> 25:46.404
I saved your sorry ass
so you can die my way.

25:46.811 --> 25:48.711
My way!
Hawk.

25:49.347 --> 25:50.712
Hawk.

25:52.851 --> 25:54.182
STABLER: Stay here.

25:59.324 --> 26:01.383
I want my mom.

26:05.263 --> 26:06.287
Cut him Ioose?

26:06.364 --> 26:08.662
BENSON: The DNA's not back.
We've got nothing
to hold him on.

26:08.733 --> 26:12.499
It's Roger's signature.
It's the killer's signature.

26:12.671 --> 26:14.138
Meaning what?

26:15.307 --> 26:18.504
The guy's
borderline retarded.
You think he's capable?

26:18.577 --> 26:20.135
Roger's smarter
than you think he is.

26:20.211 --> 26:21.644
You give me some time
alone with him,

26:21.713 --> 26:23.305
and I'II have him singing
a different tune by Iunch.

26:23.381 --> 26:25.008
Nobody's talking
to Roger alone.

26:25.083 --> 26:27.347
His mother reached out
to Legal Aid.
He's Iawyered up.

26:27.419 --> 26:29.614
And with no DNA,
we've got no grounds
for arrest.

26:29.688 --> 26:32.088
Well, while you all sit around
with your thumb up your ass,

26:32.157 --> 26:36.184
I'II take Roger's mug
out to recanvas.
You remember, police work.

26:39.397 --> 26:41.160
It's hard to make
a case for a copycat

26:41.232 --> 26:44.224
when the signature wasn't
released to the press.

26:44.302 --> 26:46.497
There is another explanation.

26:48.573 --> 26:51.167
Roger Berry's not
the SoHo Strangler.

26:53.645 --> 26:57.547
Hit the archives,
take a fresh Iook at
the old strangler files.

26:57.782 --> 27:01.582
If this strangler's been
out there all this time,
he must have Ieft a scent.

27:01.653 --> 27:04.451
Hawk would never admit that
he's wrong, especially if
he hears it from a woman.

27:04.522 --> 27:06.786
He's old-school.
He's a drunk.

27:06.858 --> 27:08.450
I talked to a cop
at Manhattan South.

27:08.526 --> 27:09.754
They said that nobody
will ride with him.

27:09.828 --> 27:11.056
Well, maybe they don't
have the guts.

27:11.129 --> 27:12.721
Well, maybe they just
want to stay alive.

27:12.797 --> 27:13.923
Maybe they should shut up
and do their...

27:13.999 --> 27:16.467
I'm just telling you
to watch your back.

27:16.534 --> 27:19.128
Sorry, Detectives,
the files already
been checked out.

27:19.204 --> 27:20.796
Under what name?

27:21.940 --> 27:24.340
Detective John Hawkins,
Manhattan South Homicide.

27:24.409 --> 27:28.743
Son of a bitch,
he's covering his ass.
Wait a minute. I'II handle it.

27:32.517 --> 27:33.677
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

27:33.752 --> 27:35.344
ROGER ON TAPE:
I didn't mean,,,

27:35.420 --> 27:36.751
John, it's EIIiot.
You in there?

27:36.821 --> 27:39.016
HAWKINS ON TAPE:
You just wanted her
to stop screaming,

27:39.124 --> 27:41.524
I didn't want her
to scream,

27:41.793 --> 27:45.593
You tied her up,
grabbed her by the throat,
I don't,,,

27:45.664 --> 27:47.359
HAWKINS: It's open.
Damn it, Roger,
Stop screwing around,

27:47.432 --> 27:51.493
I want the truth,
If I say it,
can I go home?

27:52.837 --> 27:55.567
Tell me what happened,
Okay,

27:56.908 --> 27:58.273
Okay, what?

27:58.877 --> 28:00.367
I grabbed her,

28:00.578 --> 28:03.046
You raped her,
I raped her,

28:03.815 --> 28:06.443
Then you put the flower
on her pillow and left,

28:06.551 --> 28:08.849
I gave her the flower
and left,

28:09.187 --> 28:12.213
You left her dead,
Dead,

28:14.025 --> 28:18.621
Just spending some quality
time with my old friend,
the SoHo Strangler.

28:19.264 --> 28:20.754
You and Roger?

28:21.399 --> 28:23.833
Found a neighbor
that alibied him.

28:26.438 --> 28:30.636
Puts Roger at home
when Jenny and Celia
were killed.

28:33.712 --> 28:36.545
I don't need any DNA
to tell me the rest.

28:38.349 --> 28:40.010
We'II get the guy.

28:40.385 --> 28:45.220
You know, when I first caught
this case, I had my shield
only for one year.

28:46.891 --> 28:50.452
Wanted to show everybody
what a kick-ass cop I was.

28:52.530 --> 28:55.499
Six murders Iater,
I'm still drawing blanks.

28:56.601 --> 29:02.130
So, as usual,
the media's up our ass,
talking about taking me off.

29:03.975 --> 29:05.840
Then we catch a break.

29:07.412 --> 29:11.246
A neighbor sees
a flower delivery man Ieaving
Larissa Cutler's apartment.

29:11.316 --> 29:15.650
I go down to the flower shop,
search his truck,
strike the mother Iode.

29:16.221 --> 29:17.586
Women's underwear, porno,

29:17.655 --> 29:20.681
the same kind of rope
used to tie their hands.

29:20.759 --> 29:22.488
You made your case.

29:24.429 --> 29:26.420
Not without a confession.

29:32.604 --> 29:34.936
I wanted that so bad.

29:38.443 --> 29:42.846
I put Roger in the box
and I grilled him
over and over and over,

29:43.948 --> 29:47.406
till I convinced myself
he'd been
in those apartments.

29:50.088 --> 29:52.613
I fed him every detail
of the case.

29:54.592 --> 29:58.084
And then I told him that
if he signed that confession,

29:58.163 --> 30:00.290
he'd go home to his mother.

30:03.334 --> 30:05.962
Poor dumb son of a bitch
believed me.

30:09.240 --> 30:11.834
You have a chance
to make this right.

30:16.648 --> 30:19.481
I took 18 years
from an innocent man.

30:20.218 --> 30:21.776
God knows how many women
died because of it.

30:21.853 --> 30:24.583
You can't make something
Iike that right.

30:25.957 --> 30:28.517
Okay, so,
what are you gonna do?
Quit?

30:37.735 --> 30:41.034
You wanna drink yourself
to death? I can't stop you.

30:41.773 --> 30:45.231
But what are you
gonna tell the parents
of those girls?

30:46.878 --> 30:48.971
You made a promise to them.

30:50.281 --> 30:53.739
If you're the man
that I think you are,
you'II keep it.

31:01.993 --> 31:03.119
Hawk.

31:04.295 --> 31:06.195
Hawk!
You don't have to shout.

31:06.264 --> 31:07.856
I think I found something.

31:07.932 --> 31:10.594
Believe me,
I've been over that stuff
till my eyes bled out.

31:10.668 --> 31:12.329
If there was anything to find,
I'd have found it.

31:12.403 --> 31:13.734
Arthur BIessard?
Huh?

31:13.805 --> 31:15.830
Do you remember a guy
named Arthur BIessard?

31:15.907 --> 31:18.432
Yeah.
He's one of the neighbors
that ID'd Roger.

31:18.509 --> 31:21.137
Ann Chilsen's date book
three weeks before
she was murdered.

31:21.212 --> 31:24.841
She had an appointment
with her tax man. "AB."

31:26.718 --> 31:29.448
I'II be damned. Come on.

31:33.858 --> 31:35.120
It's a Iong shot.

31:35.193 --> 31:37.753
Everything's a Iong shot
till you connect the Iast dot.

31:37.829 --> 31:41.060
What are we Iooking for?
These are my notes
on the strangler case.

31:41.132 --> 31:45.193
I used to sketch faces
to keep the interviews
straight in my head.

31:45.737 --> 31:47.295
Son of a bitch.

31:47.639 --> 31:51.006
Who's this?
Artie BIessard.
Guy was blind as a bat.

31:51.476 --> 31:55.503
Like the guy who Ieft
his contact on Celia Mitchum's
bathroom floor.

31:55.580 --> 31:57.047
The Iast dot.

31:57.482 --> 31:59.416
We traced the MO
from the 1983 strangulations

31:59.484 --> 32:00.542
to the current murders.

32:00.618 --> 32:03.348
VICAP came back
with 12 more hits
from five different cities.

32:03.421 --> 32:04.888
Arthur BIessard's
employment history

32:04.956 --> 32:06.719
puts him in the vicinity
of seven of those murders.

32:06.791 --> 32:09.316
They show the evolution
of Arthur's MO over time.

32:09.394 --> 32:12.022
We're still contacting
Iocal PDs, but all we can
come up with is

32:12.096 --> 32:15.463
Chicago is where he began
to mutilate his victims
to hide the bite marks.

32:15.533 --> 32:17.467
And he started slitting
throats in Atlanta.

32:17.535 --> 32:20.732
BENSON: In every case,
the signature matches.

32:21.005 --> 32:23.235
So, where is this
Arthur BIessard now?

32:23.308 --> 32:26.869
Well, he quit his job
at some storefront tax outfit
in Hartford Iast month.

32:26.945 --> 32:28.469
Hawk is out checking
with the Feds,

32:28.546 --> 32:30.776
see if they have any info
on subsequent employment.

32:30.848 --> 32:32.406
AIready done.
Where?

32:32.483 --> 32:35.941
26 Federal PIaza.
The bastard's working
for the IRS.

32:37.055 --> 32:39.888
His desk is right over here
in the corner.

32:41.192 --> 32:42.989
Where the hell is he?

32:43.127 --> 32:45.823
Probably out in the field.
He's one of
our busiest auditors.

32:45.897 --> 32:46.921
Oh, really?

32:46.998 --> 32:48.022
Excuse me.
What?

32:48.099 --> 32:49.191
Hey.

32:50.768 --> 32:53.396
Hey, what are you doing?
Don't you need
a search warrant?

32:54.339 --> 32:55.863
Got it covered.

32:56.774 --> 32:58.708
HAWKINS: Here we go.

32:58.776 --> 33:01.370
Jennifer Walton.
Celia Mitchum.

33:01.913 --> 33:04.074
He's using their tax return
as a dating service.

33:04.148 --> 33:08.050
Employment, marital status,
home address. He's even got
their photos from the DMV.

33:08.119 --> 33:09.916
Got an appointment book.

33:09.988 --> 33:14.925
Beverly Parsons.
34 1/2 West 23rd Street.
5:00 p.m.

33:14.993 --> 33:16.324
It's 4:45.

33:18.396 --> 33:19.761
HAWKINS: This is it.

33:20.231 --> 33:21.493
(GLASS SHATTERING)

33:24.535 --> 33:26.435
STABLER: Police! Don't move.
Oh, my God!

33:26.504 --> 33:28.495
Hi, Artie. Remember me?

33:29.374 --> 33:31.239
Spread your Iegs.
What is this?

33:31.309 --> 33:32.970
Arthur BIessard,
you're under arrest

33:33.044 --> 33:34.807
for the murders
of Jennifer Walton
and Celia Mitchum.

33:34.879 --> 33:36.574
Murder?
Did he hurt you?

33:36.647 --> 33:38.979
No, I cut myself
when I dropped the vase.

33:39.050 --> 33:40.540
Artie was helping me
clean it up.

33:40.618 --> 33:44.315
Yeah, Artie's a real neat guy.
And a hopeless romantic.

33:44.389 --> 33:46.755
Since when is it a crime
to bring a Iady flowers?

33:46.824 --> 33:49.156
You got a date
with me now, boy.

33:54.432 --> 33:56.332
BEVERLY:
Artie first contacted me
a week ago

33:56.401 --> 33:58.892
about irregularities
on my tax return.

33:58.970 --> 34:00.267
I'd just moved here
from Ithaca

34:00.338 --> 34:02.636
and couldn't afford
to fly in my accountant,

34:02.707 --> 34:04.174
but he said that was okay.

34:04.242 --> 34:07.336
He thought the discrepancies
could be cleared up
without much trouble.

34:07.412 --> 34:10.245
And then,
so, you met with him?
At his office.

34:10.313 --> 34:13.772
He seemed really nice.
He'd found more problems
with my return,

34:13.851 --> 34:15.909
and when he saw
how nervous that made me,

34:15.987 --> 34:18.012
he offered to take me
to Iunch.

34:18.089 --> 34:21.956
I felt sorry for her.
You know,
audits can be nerve-racking.

34:23.261 --> 34:26.355
But when you're in a new city
and no family or friends,

34:26.431 --> 34:28.728
it can be
downright terrifying.

34:29.132 --> 34:32.534
You give that kind of
personal attention
to all your audits?

34:32.603 --> 34:35.572
We're not all
soulless bureaucrats,
Detective.

34:35.639 --> 34:39.770
He called me at the hospital,
I'm a pedes nurse,

34:40.311 --> 34:43.610
and said he'd accidentally
double-booked.

34:43.681 --> 34:47.844
He apologized and insisted
on making it up to me

34:48.386 --> 34:49.717
by taking me to dinner.

34:49.786 --> 34:51.277
Dinner was her idea.

34:52.322 --> 34:56.589
Well, aren't there...rules
against fraternizing?

34:57.361 --> 35:00.353
Her audit
was winding down,

35:00.431 --> 35:04.424
and she seemed Iike
a nice enough girl.
So, I said, "What the heck?"

35:04.969 --> 35:07.164
That's when things
got weird.

35:08.873 --> 35:12.934
He started asking me
a Iot of questions
about my personal Iife,

35:14.679 --> 35:18.376
and then tonight he showed up
at my apartment with flowers.

35:18.749 --> 35:20.979
I shouldn't have Iet him in,

35:21.052 --> 35:24.215
but I thought
I could Iet him down gently
without screwing up my taxes.

35:24.288 --> 35:27.655
So, why'd you come back,
Artie? Temptation too great?

35:28.126 --> 35:31.323
I don't know what
you're talking about.
Come on.

35:31.562 --> 35:34.554
Roger Berry.
I put him away
for what you did.

35:34.632 --> 35:36.998
His parole gave you
carte blanche
to murder again.

35:37.068 --> 35:38.660
You knew he'd be
the prime suspect.

35:38.736 --> 35:40.966
This time we've got
DNA evidence, Artie.

35:41.038 --> 35:44.496
You know
what that means, Artie?
It means we've got you.

35:45.443 --> 35:46.933
This is crazy.

35:47.211 --> 35:48.473
You know what's crazy, Artie?

35:48.546 --> 35:50.946
Sitting in your 8x10 cell
eating your Iast meal.

35:51.015 --> 35:53.745
Or walking down the hallways
to that Iittle room
with the gurney.

35:53.818 --> 35:56.218
Are you trying to
make me confess?

35:56.287 --> 35:57.777
You want to save your ass,
don't you, Artie?

35:57.855 --> 36:00.289
I'm not going to Iie.
We can tie you
to both victims.

36:00.358 --> 36:02.292
I did their taxes.
In their bedrooms?

36:02.360 --> 36:04.760
That would be
a breach of ethics.

36:05.796 --> 36:07.491
Keep it up, Artie.

36:07.598 --> 36:08.724
Keep it up,
and I swear to God,

36:08.799 --> 36:10.994
I'II put your head
through that wall.

36:11.068 --> 36:13.434
I'II be sure and tell that
to my Iawyer.

36:13.504 --> 36:14.801
STABLER:
I didn't say anything.

36:16.474 --> 36:20.069
We searched Artie's apartment
and found a Iens case
with a single contact.

36:20.144 --> 36:22.135
AIso found a receipt
from Jean's FIowers.

36:22.213 --> 36:24.238
The same flower shop
where Roger works.

36:24.315 --> 36:26.909
It's obvious
he was setting Roger up.

36:27.785 --> 36:31.243
Any Iuck with Artie?
He Iawyered up.
Can we hold him?

36:31.322 --> 36:32.914
Unfortunately,
we have nothing
to hold him on.

36:32.990 --> 36:35.390
What about the flowers
and the contact?
Circumstantial.

36:35.459 --> 36:37.051
Well, what about the DNA
from the hair?

36:37.128 --> 36:39.028
He will argue
he was an invited guest.

36:39.096 --> 36:40.222
That's a stretch,
isn't it?

36:40.298 --> 36:41.993
CABOT:
He had Iegitimate business
with both victims,

36:42.066 --> 36:43.624
just as he did with Beverly.

36:43.701 --> 36:46.499
Circumstantial or not,
we've made cases on Iess.

36:46.571 --> 36:50.735
This time we have to contend
with history. Roger Berry,
SoHo Strangler.

36:50.808 --> 36:52.275
Roger didn't do it.

36:52.343 --> 36:54.208
His convictions are a matter
of public record,

36:54.278 --> 36:57.270
which provides
a very compelling argument
for reasonable doubt.

36:57.348 --> 36:58.906
He had access, opportunity,

36:58.983 --> 37:00.814
and according
to his arrest file,
the same signature.

37:00.885 --> 37:02.147
So, Artie just walks?

37:02.220 --> 37:05.189
If we take this to trial
and he's acquitted,
he gets a Iifetime pass.

37:05.256 --> 37:08.487
So, unless we can tie him
more definitively
to these murders,

37:08.559 --> 37:10.254
the answer is yes.

37:16.667 --> 37:19.534
Wait a minute.
What about the old murders?

37:19.604 --> 37:22.767
Artie wasn't
as experienced back then
or nearly as neat.

37:22.840 --> 37:24.808
You thinking he might have
Ieft a deposit?

37:24.875 --> 37:28.367
It's 18 years ago,
but those evidence boxes
are still at Pearson PIace.

37:28.546 --> 37:30.309
VARGAS:
We went over everything
with a fine-tooth comb.

37:30.381 --> 37:33.680
The rope, Iingerie,
fingerprint slides,
all useless.

37:34.085 --> 37:35.416
What about the bite marks?

37:35.486 --> 37:38.922
Only subcutaneous bruising
of petechiae. Nothing we could
match to a suspect.

37:38.990 --> 37:41.117
There's gotta be something.

37:41.425 --> 37:43.120
We took a closer Iook
at this bed sheet.

37:43.194 --> 37:45.424
It belongs
to the first victim,
Marcia Johnston.

37:45.496 --> 37:46.929
The bookstore clerk.
VARGAS: Correct.

37:46.998 --> 37:48.158
According to the inventory,

37:48.232 --> 37:50.666
a mixture of blood and semen
was typed from this spot.

37:50.735 --> 37:53.226
We were able to extract
enough DNA to run a panel.

37:53.304 --> 37:56.432
The only problem is,
is the sample is mixed.

37:56.507 --> 37:58.873
Meaning what?
Meaning we need DNA

37:58.943 --> 38:02.208
from both the suspect
and the victim
to make an accurate analysis.

38:02.280 --> 38:05.408
But the victim's been dead
and buried for 18 years.

38:05.483 --> 38:06.848
Unbury her.

38:07.251 --> 38:09.617
No. I won't allow it.

38:09.854 --> 38:11.845
Let Marcia rest in peace.

38:12.256 --> 38:14.816
I know how difficult
this must be for you,
Mrs. Johnston, but...

38:14.892 --> 38:16.917
No, you don't.

38:18.362 --> 38:21.991
There isn't a day goes by
I don't think
about my daughter.

38:23.000 --> 38:25.833
There was a time
I couldn't even do that,

38:26.904 --> 38:31.967
because I couldn't bear
the thought about
the horrible way she died.

38:34.712 --> 38:36.805
I finally got to the point

38:36.881 --> 38:41.511
where I could Iook
at her picture
without breaking into tears.

38:46.691 --> 38:49.057
Mrs. Johnston,

38:49.126 --> 38:51.458
I put the wrong man away
for 18 years

38:51.529 --> 38:54.054
for your daughter's murder.

38:54.131 --> 38:55.689
Now I've gotta
carry that burden

38:55.766 --> 38:59.532
along with the deaths
of all the other daughters
since then.

39:00.671 --> 39:03.538
I promise to put
Marcia's killer away.

39:03.607 --> 39:06.132
I can't do it
without your help.

39:08.012 --> 39:09.604
How many others?

39:10.414 --> 39:12.314
Seven that we know of.

39:13.584 --> 39:15.552
If I don't get it
right this time,

39:15.619 --> 39:18.554
there's a man out there
that's gonna keep on killing.

39:18.622 --> 39:21.318
What exactly will you
have to do to her?

39:21.392 --> 39:25.294
We need to extract
a sample of DNA for analysis

39:26.230 --> 39:28.164
from one of her bones.

39:28.766 --> 39:30.757
And there's no other way?

39:30.935 --> 39:33.597
Unfortunately,
Marcia's our Iast hope.

39:34.438 --> 39:35.928
My Iast hope.

39:53.057 --> 39:54.957
(POLICE SIREN WAILING)

39:55.960 --> 39:58.190
BIessard's gonna be
awfully surprised to see us.

39:58.262 --> 40:02.096
I can't wait to see
that son of a bitch's face.
Get the back.

40:02.700 --> 40:05.100
(RATTLING)
Arthur BIessard, open up.
Police.

40:08.239 --> 40:10.833
One, two, three.

(ARTHUR PANTING)

40:35.332 --> 40:36.424
Hawk?

41:08.732 --> 41:09.858
Hawk!

41:37.495 --> 41:38.757
Hawk!

41:55.212 --> 41:57.339
(ARTIE SCREAMS)

42:11.395 --> 42:13.158
Hawk, don't do this.

42:13.497 --> 42:16.523
Don't do what, partner?
STABLER: You know
this isn't right.

42:16.600 --> 42:19.194
We both know
the system sucks.

42:19.270 --> 42:22.262
This way,
it's just natural selection.

42:23.474 --> 42:24.998
(SCREAMING) No! PIease!

42:25.643 --> 42:29.170
STABLER: Hawk, you do this,
you're no better than he is.

42:31.348 --> 42:33.816
He sure as hell
won't kill anybody else.

42:33.884 --> 42:35.909
This is no way to end it.

42:35.986 --> 42:37.351
Come on.

42:38.822 --> 42:40.847
He's an evil man, EIIiot.

42:41.258 --> 42:45.524
And all it takes for evil
to triumph is for good men
to do nothing.

(SCREAMING)

42:55.940 --> 42:58.101
ARTHUR: PIease! No!

43:00.444 --> 43:03.880
You gonna make an old drunk
do all the work?
Give me a hand.

Your collar.
