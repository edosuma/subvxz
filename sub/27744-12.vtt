I have never been
so pampered in my life.

00:58.308 --> 01:01.686
There was that guy who seemed to be
in charge only of my toes.

01:01.770 --> 01:04.272
Yeah. What am I gonna do
without a toe butler?

01:04.355 --> 01:07.484
Am I supposed to tend to my own
toe comfort like some sort of animal?

01:07.567 --> 01:08.610
Then it's settled.

01:08.693 --> 01:10.528
We'll drop off an envelope of cash to Bud,

01:10.612 --> 01:13.073
skip his wedding,
and head back to the Maldives.

01:13.698 --> 01:15.575
I have $70,000 on me.

01:15.658 --> 01:17.243
I'd love to go back...

01:17.327 --> 01:18.328
[sighs]

01:18.870 --> 01:21.956
but I have to deal with whatever
Frankie has done to our company.

01:23.041 --> 01:26.753
Maybe she's realized that being in charge
isn't all it's cracked up to be.

01:26.836 --> 01:29.130
Heavy is the head that wears the crown.

01:29.214 --> 01:32.133
Yeah, well even heavier is the head
that binges<i> The Crown</i>

-[phone ringing]

01:40.475 --> 01:44.187
-No, I sent that email ten times.
-Three, four, five-- Man!

01:44.270 --> 01:46.356
-[Joan-Margaret] Wait. Oh my bad.
-[Coyote] Six, seven.

01:46.439 --> 01:48.691
I sent it to myself ten times.

01:48.775 --> 01:50.443
Stop saying numbers.

01:50.527 --> 01:52.570
-Oh, welcome home!
-Hey, Grace.

01:52.654 --> 01:54.364
Who are all these people?

01:54.447 --> 01:56.491
Oh, this is Coyote, Frankie's son.

01:56.741 --> 01:57.909
We've met.

01:58.118 --> 01:59.536
Where is his mother?

01:59.619 --> 02:00.954
[metal clattering]

02:04.874 --> 02:06.042
Oh.

02:06.126 --> 02:08.378
Ha, well, well, well.

02:08.753 --> 02:11.131
The prodigal daughter returns.

02:11.214 --> 02:14.134
She flew the coop
when she couldn't handle the heat.

02:14.217 --> 02:16.302
Well, there's a new sheriff in town.

02:16.386 --> 02:18.012
Yeah, me. I'm back.

02:18.096 --> 02:20.056
Why are you still making donuts?

02:20.140 --> 02:22.142
I'm not. I'm making a cake-yata.

02:22.600 --> 02:24.394
-A what?
-For the wedding!

02:24.477 --> 02:27.397
It has the taste of a cake,
but the fun of a piñata.

02:27.480 --> 02:30.733
Well, your track record with piñatas
is so stellar.

02:30.817 --> 02:33.153
[chuckles] Boy, you hit one beehive...

02:33.236 --> 02:34.237
Repeatedly!

02:34.654 --> 02:36.573
You hit one beehive repeatedly.

02:36.656 --> 02:39.367
Oh, the runaway thinks
she can just waltz back in here

02:39.450 --> 02:41.744
and start zingin'
the living daylights out of me.

02:41.828 --> 02:44.539
I didn't run away. You drove me away.

02:44.622 --> 02:47.125
And what's with all the Post-its?

02:47.208 --> 02:50.378
"Fax the minions."
What's this supposed to mean?

02:50.461 --> 02:51.880
Wouldn't you like to know?

02:51.963 --> 02:53.923
Yes, this is me asking to know.

02:54.007 --> 02:55.091
[Frankie] Uh, Joan-Margaret?

02:55.717 --> 02:59.220
Do I have time to catch Grace up
on all the things she missed

02:59.304 --> 03:01.931
when she fucked off to God knows where?

03:02.015 --> 03:05.810
You've got 12 minutes at 3:17.

03:05.894 --> 03:07.061
Goddamn it!

03:07.896 --> 03:10.773
3:17. I'll reserve the meditation room.

03:10.857 --> 03:11.858
Great.

03:11.941 --> 03:13.776
[cell phone ringing]

03:17.280 --> 03:19.282
-Hello?
-[Joan-Margaret] Yes, hello.

03:19.365 --> 03:23.870
Just calling to confirm
your 3:17 with Frankie Bergstein,

03:23.953 --> 03:26.539
tentatively in the meditation room.

03:31.419 --> 03:34.172
Here's a pic that Evan
sent last week from the yard.

03:34.255 --> 03:36.257
Notice the ab definition.

03:36.341 --> 03:37.717
I think the bigger question here is

03:37.800 --> 03:42.555
who is taking all these incredibly
professional photographs of Evan in jail?

03:42.639 --> 03:46.392
Oh, his good friend, Ramirez
keeps a phone in his belly fold.

03:47.227 --> 03:49.312
Mint Juleps, coming in cold.

03:49.395 --> 03:51.522
-[Allison] Thank you.
-[Bud] Oh, good.

03:51.606 --> 03:53.399
Yeah. Okay.

03:53.983 --> 03:56.110
-[Goldie] Thank you.
-Thank you so much.

03:56.194 --> 03:57.528
-[all] Mm.
-[Goldie slurps]

03:57.612 --> 03:59.781
<i>-Salud.</i>
-Oh, this is so good.

04:00.615 --> 04:01.491
Oops.

04:02.033 --> 04:03.284
I guess I miscounted.

04:03.368 --> 04:06.120
Yes, because six
is a notoriously tough number.

04:08.414 --> 04:12.043
So, Robert, Allison tells us
that you like to sing and dance.

04:12.126 --> 04:14.087
Oh, he's a theater machine.

04:14.754 --> 04:17.507
Is that what
the gold footless shoe is for?

04:17.590 --> 04:19.509
That's called a Tappy.

04:20.093 --> 04:22.303
It's an award not unlike the Tony.

04:22.387 --> 04:25.640
I received that
for my performance in<i> 1776.</i>

04:25.723 --> 04:27.976
He's actually rehearsing for
another one right now.

04:28.059 --> 04:32.772
Yes, well, like all things
which once were and will never be again,

04:32.981 --> 04:37.026
that life is over now...
thanks to the man sitting across from you.

04:37.735 --> 04:39.862
-Way to go, Bud.
-[Sol] He means me.

04:40.113 --> 04:42.740
-I ended the life.
-[Robert] Tit for tat.

04:43.032 --> 04:47.370
I lost his dog for 20 minutes, so
he got me fired from the theater forever.

04:47.620 --> 04:50.498
Which, as you can see, was a mistake,

04:50.581 --> 04:54.961
because he deserves a Tappy
for this performance:

04:55.044 --> 04:58.131
"Best Complaint by a Baby Man."

04:58.214 --> 04:59.215
[laughs]

04:59.299 --> 05:01.259
You guys... stop.

05:02.051 --> 05:04.470
You know, Allison is a bit of a performer.

05:05.054 --> 05:07.390
Do you remember
when you re-enacted your first seizure

05:07.473 --> 05:08.808
for your Girl Scout troop?

05:08.891 --> 05:11.853
And then it turned into a real seizure.

05:11.936 --> 05:13.563
-So, I--
-Hey, everybody,

05:13.646 --> 05:15.315
here comes a Goldie story.

05:15.398 --> 05:17.525
-Last person to stay awake wins.
-It's...

05:19.485 --> 05:21.487
We'll have to play that fun game later.

05:22.113 --> 05:25.158
-Mom, we have to go pick up my dress!
-Dear God, the dress.

05:25.575 --> 05:28.870
-I cannot wait for you to see it.
-It's really something to see.

05:29.162 --> 05:30.455
But in a good way, right?

05:30.663 --> 05:34.709
-Mm... You're going to see it! [sighs]
-[chuckles]

05:36.085 --> 05:38.504
You're gonna see it. [laughs]

05:39.547 --> 05:40.673
[both grunting]

05:41.424 --> 05:44.218
If she's trying to escape,
maybe you should just let her.

05:44.302 --> 05:48.931
No, I'm giving her a good stretch out
with this great exercise we found online.

05:49.182 --> 05:50.892
-[Joan-Margaret grunts]
-Any better?

05:50.975 --> 05:52.935
-Oh, loads!
-[Frankie exhales]

05:53.436 --> 05:55.605
The cane is purely decorative
at this point.

05:55.688 --> 05:56.522
[Frankie chuckles]

05:56.606 --> 06:00.109
Well, good to see you girls
are piling on the affectations.

06:00.193 --> 06:01.402
This is real.

06:01.986 --> 06:02.862
Bar fight.

06:03.696 --> 06:05.615
[laughs] I'm kidding.

06:05.698 --> 06:07.950
-Barnes and Noble fight.
-[Frankie chuckles]

06:08.117 --> 06:09.994
I bedazzled her cane.

06:10.078 --> 06:12.789
Oh, we've been getting
lots of compliments.

06:12.872 --> 06:15.124
-From pimps?
-And whores.

06:17.126 --> 06:18.669
I'll get my whiteboard.

06:18.753 --> 06:22.465
Oh, no. Please, no more whiteboard.
Just tell me what's going on, would you?

06:22.548 --> 06:23.966
I present...

06:24.675 --> 06:26.219
Operation OPP.

06:26.302 --> 06:27.720
Operation Operation?

06:27.804 --> 06:30.515
Operation "Older Person Priority."

06:30.890 --> 06:33.893
You see, Grace, I remembered
why we started this company

06:33.976 --> 06:35.311
in the first place.

06:35.395 --> 06:38.356
Well, I never forgot:
to help older women.

06:38.439 --> 06:43.236
Exactly. To put them first,
unlike at the pharmacy or the crosswalk.

06:43.444 --> 06:46.781
Those senior volunteers over there
are from Walden Villas.

06:47.782 --> 06:49.242
There's nobody over there.

06:49.534 --> 06:52.537
Oh, well, it's almost 3:30,
they went to dinner.

06:52.912 --> 06:54.789
But they have been verifying the ages

06:54.872 --> 06:58.918
of all the people
to whom we owe a free Ménage.

06:59.127 --> 07:00.169
Because...

07:00.253 --> 07:04.298
Because at Vybrant,
older women come first.

07:05.883 --> 07:07.802
So, what does all this mean?

07:07.885 --> 07:11.347
Well, the older you are,
the faster you get your vibrator.

07:11.431 --> 07:15.685
Those with AARP cards are put in Group A,

07:15.977 --> 07:19.397
those with arthritis in Group double A...

07:19.480 --> 07:20.648
And what's Group X?

07:20.731 --> 07:22.650
Oh, a seminal punk band.

07:22.733 --> 07:24.444
No, on your big board.

07:24.694 --> 07:27.530
Oh, those are the younger people
we don't have to worry about yet

07:27.613 --> 07:30.867
'cause they'll get their vibrators
when they're old enough to need one.

07:30.950 --> 07:34.704
So are you trying to tell me that
Operation Operation is actually working?

07:34.912 --> 07:36.789
Well, sales are up.

07:37.123 --> 07:40.835
And<i> Fast Company</i> wants to interview me
for a big story they're doing.

07:40.918 --> 07:44.380
Some lady had a meltdown
and they want me to replace her.

07:44.464 --> 07:46.215
I heard it was not a meltdown.

07:46.299 --> 07:49.469
-I heard she's in an institution now.
-[Grace scoffs]

07:49.552 --> 07:52.763
But either way, I have things
pretty much under control here.

07:52.847 --> 07:55.224
Oh, come on,
you're still covered with Post-its.

07:55.308 --> 07:58.811
-Oh, these are all wedding stuff.
-Do you want me to help with it?

07:59.020 --> 08:02.398
-Do you want to help with it?
-Well, if you need me to help with it.

08:02.482 --> 08:04.525
Well, if you need me
to need you to help--

08:04.609 --> 08:06.986
Oh, God, just give me the fucking--

08:07.069 --> 08:10.281
Well, wait, wait,
you forgot a bunch of stuff.

-Hey. Congrats, man.
-Oh, thanks, Bar.

08:26.255 --> 08:28.382
How's Allison? How does she look?
How's she doing?

08:28.466 --> 08:30.134
She looks...

08:30.218 --> 08:32.178
She didn't have anything on
when we saw her.

08:32.261 --> 08:33.930
What? She was nude?

08:34.013 --> 08:34.972
[Barry] Um...

08:35.056 --> 08:37.808
I don't remember.
Brianna, was she nude or...

08:37.892 --> 08:42.355
Mm... Okay, here's the deal...
Allison's dress is very specific.

08:42.438 --> 08:45.608
Okay, well, I mean it can't be
that bad, right? I mean, it's a dress.

08:45.691 --> 08:46.526
[Brianna] Mm...

08:46.609 --> 08:51.781
It's more like what a dead child
was buried in in the 1800s.

08:51.864 --> 08:52.823
My God.

08:52.907 --> 08:54.992
The important thing is not to react.

08:55.076 --> 08:56.911
Or look directly at it.

08:56.994 --> 08:59.330
-You mean like the sun?
-Exactly.

08:59.747 --> 09:01.290
I thought Frankie made a cake.

09:01.374 --> 09:03.834
Yeah. No, she made a cake-yata...

09:04.335 --> 09:06.796
which is exactly why I got a real cake.

09:06.879 --> 09:08.714
Did you do any of her Post-its?

09:09.465 --> 09:11.217
Well, which one should I have done?

09:11.300 --> 09:14.929
"Reach up and wave at the lights"
or the one with a cat drawing on it?

09:15.012 --> 09:18.641
It looks like it's wearing roller blades.
That might mean something.

09:18.933 --> 09:21.727
The best way to help Frankie
is ignore what she says she wants

09:21.811 --> 09:23.646
and just do what you know she needs.

09:23.729 --> 09:25.940
So when she asked me
to buy her a fanboat...

09:26.023 --> 09:27.108
Oh, you didn't.

09:27.191 --> 09:28.234
No.

09:29.360 --> 09:30.570
Just one quick call.

09:32.572 --> 09:34.198
You guys go. Go, go, go.

09:34.282 --> 09:35.992
-Yes!
-Do not get dirty.

09:36.534 --> 09:38.452
I won't, and I'll keep
an eye on them, too.

09:38.536 --> 09:40.121
-You're a saint.
-[chuckles]

09:44.500 --> 09:46.294
Principal Dan is your date?

09:46.627 --> 09:49.213
I don't know, I don't wanna
put a label on things because--

09:49.297 --> 09:50.881
No, I don't care about that.

09:51.299 --> 09:53.801
He's trying to cut my music program.

09:54.260 --> 09:56.554
Okay, your brother is getting married.

09:56.637 --> 09:58.264
Please don't do anything weird.

09:58.347 --> 10:00.141
Yeah, yeah, whatevs. I need your kids.

10:01.350 --> 10:02.768
[Coyote] Hey! M&M!

10:05.938 --> 10:09.442
Smile like music changed your life
or you won't get your twenty bucks.

10:22.455 --> 10:25.207
I love when the groom walks down the aisle
with his mom and dad.

10:25.291 --> 10:28.127
They're giving him away,
like his birth parents.

10:29.420 --> 10:31.005
You are frightening.

10:39.972 --> 10:42.600

11:07.249 --> 11:09.001
Did you make that dress?

11:09.085 --> 11:10.378
[chuckles softly] I wish.

11:11.420 --> 11:12.630
You look beautiful.

22:15.917 --> 22:17.836
Come on, everybody, get a piece of toast.

22:18.378 --> 22:19.296
That's...

22:19.379 --> 22:20.380
No. We're leaving.

22:20.464 --> 22:22.716
Oh, come on. Come on. Please?

22:24.009 --> 22:24.926
[man] Sir?

22:25.677 --> 22:27.679
All right. Hold your toast up.

22:29.181 --> 22:31.892
To Bud... and Allison.

22:32.100 --> 22:33.852
This bread has no seeds,

22:34.061 --> 22:35.687
no traces of nuts,

22:35.771 --> 22:37.689
just lots of love.

22:38.357 --> 22:39.191
L'chaim.

22:39.274 --> 22:40.484
[all] L'chaim!

22:43.028 --> 22:46.656
[grunts] Cake-yata, coming through!

22:47.282 --> 22:48.658
Ooh.

22:48.742 --> 22:49.951
[applause]

22:50.035 --> 22:51.244
[grunts]

22:52.621 --> 22:54.081
-[exhales deeply]
-You did it!

22:54.581 --> 22:55.582
What's inside?

22:55.665 --> 22:58.543
-Oh, well, only one way to find out.
-Mm-mm.

22:58.835 --> 22:59.795
Okay.

23:02.798 --> 23:03.882
All right.

23:07.135 --> 23:09.137
-Okay, here we go.
-[Sol] That's a big piece.

23:11.348 --> 23:12.808
[all] Oh!

23:12.891 --> 23:14.559
[laughing and applauding]

23:15.602 --> 23:17.354
It's just like my Pinterest!

23:18.021 --> 23:20.690
-Do you like it?
-I love it. Thank you so much.

23:20.774 --> 23:23.693
Let's hear it for the most amazing mother
in the world, everyone!

23:23.777 --> 23:25.695
-[applause]
-[Allison] What a great job!

23:25.862 --> 23:27.364
-[woman] Frankie!
-[Bud] Yes!

23:30.033 --> 23:33.662
Al, I had an absolute blast off.

23:33.745 --> 23:36.206
-Aw.
-And Bud is so great.

23:36.623 --> 23:38.458
And Sol is great.

23:39.501 --> 23:41.211
-The sea lions are great.
-Christ,

23:41.294 --> 23:44.840
Goldie, what'd you do,
eat the open bar?

23:45.590 --> 23:46.633
Maybe.

23:47.342 --> 23:49.261
Come on. I'm taking you home. [grunts]

23:50.929 --> 23:52.013
Oh.

23:52.097 --> 23:54.433
[Goldie] Vince... look at me.

23:55.183 --> 23:58.186
Look at me in the windows to my soul.

23:58.895 --> 24:01.356
Shut... the fuck up.

24:01.982 --> 24:04.109
Shut all the way the fuck up

24:04.192 --> 24:08.113
until you reach the top
of Shut Fuck Mountain,

24:08.196 --> 24:11.908
where there are
no more fuck-ups to shut.

24:15.996 --> 24:17.247
[Goldie inhales deeply]

24:19.166 --> 24:20.333
Here's to me.

24:20.417 --> 24:23.211
When you stood up to Peter for me,
were you that good?

24:25.172 --> 24:29.176
I might not have taken him
all the way up Shut Fuck Mountain,

24:29.259 --> 24:30.844
but that was the gist.

24:30.927 --> 24:35.557
I may be a baby man
and you may have serious boundary issues,

24:36.349 --> 24:38.101
but at least we can hold our liquor.

24:39.352 --> 24:40.395
Ready to go home?

24:42.397 --> 24:44.316
We've got one stop first.

24:47.402 --> 24:49.404
[wind blowing]

24:57.287 --> 24:58.413
You disappeared.

24:58.914 --> 24:59.956
I'd like to.

25:00.665 --> 25:03.335
You had a fight. It's okay...

25:04.503 --> 25:06.171
This one didn't feel okay.

25:07.839 --> 25:09.591
It felt like something broke.

25:11.468 --> 25:14.179
Maybe Frankie and I
don't make sense anymore, you know?

25:15.514 --> 25:18.642
Maybe we were here to get each other
through the worst moment of our lives

25:18.725 --> 25:21.770
and... now it's time to move on.

25:21.853 --> 25:24.898
Ready and willing and able
to help with any and all moving on.

25:27.609 --> 25:29.152
Oh, you've helped already.

25:30.278 --> 25:32.906
So much. So much.

25:32.989 --> 25:36.868
I have half a mind to jet us
back to the Maldives right now.

25:37.369 --> 25:39.621
-We never should've left.
-Then let's go back.

25:39.704 --> 25:42.582
Or better yet,
let's go anywhere we want.

25:42.916 --> 25:44.251
Any time we want.

25:45.544 --> 25:46.461
Marry me.

25:48.338 --> 25:49.339
What?

25:50.590 --> 25:52.175
Are you crazy?

25:52.259 --> 25:54.427
So? Marry me anyway.

25:54.928 --> 25:56.471
Where is this coming from?

25:57.264 --> 25:58.723
From a simple place.

25:59.808 --> 26:00.725
I love you.

26:02.686 --> 26:05.230
And I want to spend
the rest of my life with you.

26:17.409 --> 26:18.243
[Sol] Step.

26:19.160 --> 26:20.287
Step.

26:23.081 --> 26:23.999
Oh.

26:24.833 --> 26:27.669
Seriously, Sol,
you're starting to scare me.

26:27.752 --> 26:29.504
No need to be scared.

26:35.885 --> 26:36.720
Hey, handsome.

26:37.679 --> 26:39.389
What are you all doing here?

26:39.681 --> 26:41.266
We came to see the show.

26:41.516 --> 26:42.350
What show?
