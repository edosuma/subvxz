Jessica,
here's you backpack.

00:29.738 --> 00:31.531
Thanks, Craiggy.

00:31.531 --> 00:33.450
Nicole: <i>So the roads to your
grandparents were clear</i>

00:33.450 --> 00:34.909
<i>when we drove up
this morning.</i>

00:34.993 --> 00:36.286
Watch it, Craig!

00:36.286 --> 00:38.747
Sorry, Mom.
Craig's being a maniac.

00:38.747 --> 00:40.457
No, I'm not!

00:40.457 --> 00:42.792
<i>Be patient with him
and your sister.</i>

00:42.876 --> 00:44.627
<i>I'm counting on you
to get them here.</i>

00:44.711 --> 00:47.005
Don't worry, Mom,
I'm the responsible one.

00:47.005 --> 00:49.215
<i>Wait, did you remember
the punch?!</i>

00:49.299 --> 00:50.550
Okay, you make sure the lid

00:50.550 --> 00:52.051
is on tight
so it doesn't spill over.

00:52.135 --> 00:54.804
And don't forget the candles
for the centerpieces I made.

00:54.888 --> 00:56.473
And am I forgetting
something else?

00:59.309 --> 01:00.643
And the gifts.

01:00.727 --> 01:03.813
Ooh, please don't forget
your grandparents' gifts.

01:03.897 --> 01:06.816
Mom!
I got what you forgot.

01:06.900 --> 01:08.610
We'll see you soon!

01:08.610 --> 01:10.487
Bernard...

01:10.487 --> 01:12.280
I accidentally
locked the doors.

01:12.280 --> 01:15.450
Can you open them for me?

01:15.450 --> 01:17.702
Aw, hold on,
lemme just --

01:17.786 --> 01:19.037
Where are my keys?

01:19.037 --> 01:22.373
Alright, looks like
we've got everything.

01:22.457 --> 01:23.458
Craig!

01:23.458 --> 01:25.001
Oh, right.

01:26.461 --> 01:28.463

to lock it.

01:38.181 --> 01:39.766
The keys...

01:39.766 --> 01:43.394
are still inside the house.

01:43.478 --> 01:45.146
We're locked out!

01:45.230 --> 01:47.857
Ugh,
I am too old for this.

01:47.941 --> 01:50.443
Dude, we've done this
type of episode already.

01:50.527 --> 01:52.237
Gyerrr-agh!

01:52.237 --> 01:54.155
Mom's gonna kill me!

01:54.239 --> 01:57.116

kill me first.

01:57.200 --> 01:58.618

01:58.618 --> 02:01.287

to snow all day!

02:03.206 --> 02:05.792
Eep!

02:05.792 --> 02:07.043
It's okay, Bernard.

02:07.043 --> 02:08.837
We can just break
th' window.

02:08.837 --> 02:10.880
Yeah,
we can patch it with ice!

02:10.964 --> 02:12.799
Spare me, you two.

02:12.799 --> 02:15.593
Wait.
The spare key to the house.

02:15.677 --> 02:17.929
I left mine with Alexis.

02:17.929 --> 02:20.974
Ooo,
Bernard's got a girlfriend!

02:20.974 --> 02:23.685
Yes, I do, it's been well
established at this point.

02:23.685 --> 02:25.687
We just gotta run to her house,
grab the key,

02:25.687 --> 02:27.522
and we'll be
on the road in no time.

02:27.522 --> 02:29.482
It'll be
a holiday adventure!

02:29.566 --> 02:31.526
Yeah!
I'll lead the way!

02:31.526 --> 02:33.736
Craig,
it's this way.

02:33.820 --> 02:36.072

02:45.290 --> 02:48.585
You made it to the secular
holiday celebration after all!

02:48.585 --> 02:50.420
My parents aren't here,
so we're getting

02:50.420 --> 02:53.006
a little buck wild,
if you know what I mean.

02:53.006 --> 02:56.342
Jessica:
Hurry up and find a song
for musical chairs, Cariss!

02:56.426 --> 02:58.094
Cariss: Oh, my gosh, chill.

02:58.094 --> 03:00.263
Musical chairs?!

03:00.263 --> 03:02.348
I must play, Nar Nar!

03:02.432 --> 03:03.725

03:19.866 --> 03:21.117
Beep.
Hyah!

03:21.117 --> 03:22.410
Yeah, I did it!

03:22.410 --> 03:26.080
You're in my seat, Gib-son.

03:26.164 --> 03:27.540
Outta my way, booty!

03:27.624 --> 03:28.708
Wah!

03:28.708 --> 03:29.792

03:39.886 --> 03:43.556
Now I can see into forever
just like Bernard!

03:43.640 --> 03:45.642
Hey now, my eyes
aren't that bad.

03:45.642 --> 03:48.019
Bernard, didn't we come here
for something?

03:48.019 --> 03:50.939
What?
No -- Oh, right!

03:50.939 --> 03:52.607
Alexis,
we got locked out.

03:52.607 --> 03:54.609
Do you have the spare key
to my house?

03:54.609 --> 03:55.818
Spare key?

03:55.902 --> 03:57.654
Didn't I give it to you,
Cariss?

03:57.654 --> 03:59.405
Wha?
No, you know better than that.

03:59.489 --> 04:01.658
I gave it to Amina.
She's right.

04:01.658 --> 04:03.993
But then I accidentally
washed it, so...

04:04.077 --> 04:06.245
I thought it'd be safer
with Cariss.

04:06.329 --> 04:07.789
You thought wrong.

04:07.789 --> 04:09.290
I gave 'em to Gibson.

04:09.374 --> 04:10.667
Yeah, and I left it back

04:10.667 --> 04:12.502
at the Williams family home
where it belonged.

04:12.502 --> 04:15.338
Cuz I did not want
that kind of responsibility.

04:15.338 --> 04:18.257
It's kinda funny
if you think about it.

04:18.341 --> 04:19.801
Uuuuugh!

04:19.801 --> 04:21.678
What now, Nar Nar?

04:21.678 --> 04:23.930
Tsk, Mom and Dad
were depending on me.

04:23.930 --> 04:26.391
I don't wanna have to call them
to come get us.

04:26.391 --> 04:29.686
Yeah, that's gonna
take forever.

04:29.686 --> 04:31.980
You didn't give a spare key
to one of your friends, Craig?

04:31.980 --> 04:33.147
Oh, right!

04:33.231 --> 04:35.274
Alright, guys.
This way, this way.

04:35.358 --> 04:36.609
After me, after me.

04:38.987 --> 04:40.196
Oh, Craig'th!

04:40.196 --> 04:42.073
Hoo!
I'm sorry, can I come in?

04:43.825 --> 04:45.660
Oh come in, come in!
You look cold!

04:45.660 --> 04:47.745
Father and I art
taking a breaketh

04:47.829 --> 04:50.206
from our
medieval movie marathon

04:50.206 --> 04:52.041
to have Hanukkah feast!

04:53.042 --> 04:54.210
Dad! Look!

04:54.210 --> 04:56.045

and sister are here!

04:56.129 --> 04:58.298
Hi, Mr. Pokoly!

04:58.298 --> 05:00.216
So, um, Kelsey, I --

05:00.216 --> 05:01.426
Wanteth some foodeth?

05:01.426 --> 05:03.219
I made some latkes!

05:01.509 --> 05:03.219
Oh!

05:03.219 --> 05:05.680
I would like a latkes
I'm hungry!

05:05.680 --> 05:07.432
Where is the spare key Craig
gave you?

05:07.432 --> 05:10.685
Ah, the key
to the Williams' domain?

05:10.685 --> 05:13.229
I hid it in the impenetrable
chest of keys

05:13.229 --> 05:14.564
safely buried deep,

05:14.564 --> 05:18.735
somewhere in the land
over which Mortimor watches.

05:18.735 --> 05:21.112
What?
Um, where?

05:21.112 --> 05:22.655
The front yard.

05:25.033 --> 05:28.494
Ugh, I don't remember
exactly where I hid it...

05:28.578 --> 05:31.748
But if you find any
dragon bones, they're mine!

05:35.877 --> 05:37.712
Sewage line?

05:37.712 --> 05:38.713
Uh-oh.

05:38.713 --> 05:39.922
Uh, Kelsey?

05:40.006 --> 05:41.924
How deep did you bury
this thing?

05:42.008 --> 05:44.093
I tried for the center
of the Earth!

05:44.177 --> 05:46.721
But my -- my arms
are kinda short.

05:46.721 --> 05:49.265
Huh, Jessica,
you haven't dug anything!

05:49.265 --> 05:50.433
I did, too!

05:50.433 --> 05:52.268
I dug away
all this snow!

05:52.268 --> 05:54.479
And then there
was only ground!

05:54.479 --> 05:56.647
May I?

06:01.277 --> 06:04.072
We found the impenetrable chest
of keys!

06:04.072 --> 06:06.074
I mean, I found the impenatrable
chest of keys,

06:06.074 --> 06:07.283
let's make that clear.

06:07.283 --> 06:09.619
Yeaugh!

06:09.619 --> 06:11.913
Oh, it's locked.

06:11.913 --> 06:13.414
Where's the key for this,
Kelsey?

06:13.498 --> 06:15.333
Why, of course,
safely also

06:15.333 --> 06:19.796
in the impenetrable
chest of keys.

06:19.796 --> 06:21.255
Oh.

06:21.339 --> 06:23.091
Craig: Tell your dad sorry
your pipes froze,

06:23.091 --> 06:24.884
but thanks for
the latkes and noodles!

06:24.884 --> 06:26.844
Have a happy Hanukkah!

06:26.928 --> 06:28.596
Peace!

06:31.057 --> 06:34.435
We've run all over town,
now it's dark and snowing.

06:34.519 --> 06:36.479
It's so cold, my noodles
are already frozen.

06:38.481 --> 06:39.941
And Mom,
she's probably like...

06:42.485 --> 06:44.779
She heard me.

06:44.779 --> 06:46.572
Nicole: <i>Ooh, you'd better
not be driving!</i>

06:46.656 --> 06:47.824
<i>But are you almost here?</i>

06:47.824 --> 06:49.492
Mom!
No, I'm not driving!

06:49.492 --> 06:52.495
I'm just, uh, stopped at a gas
station, gassing up!

06:52.495 --> 06:54.288
Yeah, we left a little late
because of some

06:54.372 --> 06:56.457
Craig and Jessica
tomfoolery.

06:56.541 --> 06:57.416
Hey!
Hey!

06:57.500 --> 06:59.377
Well drive safe, but hurry!

06:59.377 --> 07:00.795
We've got cups but no plates,

07:00.795 --> 07:03.297
collared but no greens,
a tree but no gifts,

07:03.381 --> 07:05.633
and the guests
are arriving soon!

07:05.633 --> 07:08.845
Well, luckily we'll be
arriving soon.

07:08.845 --> 07:10.221
Seeya! Soon!

07:10.221 --> 07:12.181
Ber-nard!

07:12.265 --> 07:14.851
How could you betray us
with that lie!

07:14.851 --> 07:18.187
There's eyes all around,
mister!

07:18.271 --> 07:22.191
Don't you try and drag my name
onto that naughty list with you.

07:22.275 --> 07:24.193
Yeah,
this is all your fault.

07:24.277 --> 07:27.280
And you can't trust teens
with a key.

07:27.280 --> 07:29.532
Oh, okay, my fault?!

07:29.532 --> 07:31.159
You locked the door!

07:31.159 --> 07:33.661
And your little friend
is so dumb, she just --

07:33.661 --> 07:34.745
Stop!

07:34.829 --> 07:36.497
It's hard
to watch you fight.

07:36.581 --> 07:40.334
And you two give away spare keys
like yesterday's milk.

07:40.418 --> 07:45.006
I trust no one with my spare
key, not even my family.

07:45.006 --> 07:47.341
Wait, you have
a spare key, Jessica?

07:47.425 --> 07:48.718
Where is it?

07:48.718 --> 07:50.511
Back at our house.

07:52.680 --> 07:54.765
I made up a rhyme
to help me remember.

07:56.517 --> 07:58.311
Okay, it goes...

07:58.311 --> 07:59.520
Uhh...

07:59.604 --> 08:02.190
The sun is, uh...

08:02.190 --> 08:03.816
No, it's like,

08:03.900 --> 08:05.401
the moon at night?

08:05.401 --> 08:08.404
No, moon doesn't rhyme
with anything.

08:08.404 --> 08:13.159
The sun is sweet, where did
they put all of the meeeaaaat?

08:13.159 --> 08:14.577
Hmmmmmm...

08:14.577 --> 08:18.831
I'm sorry, my brothers,
but I can not remember!

08:18.915 --> 08:22.168
Hey, hey, hey, it's okay,
Jessica, you did your best.

08:22.168 --> 08:24.253
We'll figure something
else out, right?

08:24.337 --> 08:25.463
I dunno, Craig.

08:25.463 --> 08:29.967
My toes are frozen
and my tips are frosted.

08:30.051 --> 08:31.636
What about that JP kid?

08:31.636 --> 08:34.639
Y'know, I gave it some thought,
then I just gave it to Kelsey.

08:34.639 --> 08:36.390
I wish the sun was out.

08:36.474 --> 08:37.516
I miss it.

08:37.600 --> 08:40.853
Shining so bright,
hearts a flutter,

08:40.937 --> 08:42.605
find my keeyy...

08:42.605 --> 08:44.565
in the gutter!

08:44.649 --> 08:47.568
That's where my spare key is!
Up there!

08:47.652 --> 08:49.528
In the gutter!

08:49.612 --> 08:51.113
Yeah!
Way to go, Jessica!

08:51.197 --> 08:53.241
Man, I'm really glad you --

08:53.241 --> 08:55.326
Wait, why and how on Earth
did you manage

08:55.326 --> 08:56.786
to get them up there?

08:56.786 --> 08:59.747
I threw them up there where
no one could steal it.

08:59.747 --> 09:02.583
'Cause I'm very responsible,
Bernard.

09:02.667 --> 09:04.794
So what's your trick
for getting them down?

09:06.087 --> 09:08.756
There's no trick.
They're just up there.

09:08.756 --> 09:09.966
Huh?!

09:09.966 --> 09:12.426
It's kind of funny
if you think about it.

09:12.510 --> 09:14.679
I'm so cold!

09:14.679 --> 09:18.140
Nobody told you to wear that
lil jacket during the winter!

09:18.224 --> 09:22.395
I hate the bulky stylings
of winter coats!

09:22.395 --> 09:23.854
I have an idea.

09:23.938 --> 09:25.940
But it's gonna take our
combined efforts to work.

09:25.940 --> 09:27.400
Y'all ready?

09:27.400 --> 09:31.862
I'll do whatever
it takes to look responsible.

09:31.946 --> 09:34.907
Craig: Jessica, grab the candy
canes from the yard.

09:34.991 --> 09:37.576
Bernard, pull down the lights
from around the house!

09:37.660 --> 09:39.495
Hup!

09:39.495 --> 09:40.997
Heh, that was e--

09:43.666 --> 09:46.043
Aaaand...there!

09:46.127 --> 09:47.753
Ta-daaa!

09:47.837 --> 09:51.132
Nar Nar, take these and throw
them up towards the gutter.

09:53.259 --> 09:55.303
Okay, here goes!

09:57.722 --> 10:02.184
Yes! I'm gonna look so
responsible after all this!

10:02.268 --> 10:04.270
Now, grab hold, siblings!

10:04.270 --> 10:05.771
Readyyyyyy...

10:05.855 --> 10:07.815
Puuuuullll!

10:07.815 --> 10:09.692
Pull harder!

10:09.692 --> 10:11.068
Jessica: It's coming loose!

10:11.152 --> 10:12.403
We almost got it!

10:12.403 --> 10:14.030
C'mon, Williams' siblings!

10:20.745 --> 10:22.371
Weeeee did iiiiiit!

10:22.455 --> 10:23.831
Yeeaaaah!

10:23.831 --> 10:26.917
Williams! Williams!
Williams!

10:27.001 --> 10:28.210
Whoa! Wha?!

10:32.173 --> 10:33.382
Oh.

10:36.177 --> 10:38.554
<i>I wish you'd have told me
you got locked out earlier.</i>

10:38.554 --> 10:41.891
<i>We gave the Mercer family
a spare key years ago.</i>

10:41.891 --> 10:43.225
Haha, yeah!

10:43.309 --> 10:45.770
I go to your house all the time
when you're not home.

10:45.770 --> 10:47.980
It's kinda funny
when you think about it.

10:48.064 --> 10:50.399
No, it's not.

10:50.483 --> 10:51.567
What a mess.

10:51.567 --> 10:53.402
I guess I shouldn't have
lied to Mom.

10:53.486 --> 10:54.570
So, we all agree?

10:54.570 --> 10:56.238
A dinosaur wrecked the car?

10:57.782 --> 11:00.159
The truth is now the lie.

11:00.159 --> 11:02.203
Santa can never know.

11:07.792 --> 11:12.213
♪ I know
I don't have to feel alone ♪

11:12.213 --> 11:15.591
♪ 'Cause I'll see you tomorrow ♪

11:15.591 --> 11:16.884
♪ At the creek ♪

11:16.884 --> 11:19.595
Just like I drew it.
