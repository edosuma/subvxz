01:30.767 --> 01:33.900
Blanche Devereaux's
going on a diet.

01:33.967 --> 01:36.166
Could you wait until tomorrow?

01:36.233 --> 01:39.033
I've got some Sarah Lee stock
to unload.

01:40.767 --> 01:43.133
Wait. Can I have those gummi bears?

01:43.200 --> 01:44.734
Aren't they good?

01:44.800 --> 01:46.200
I don't eat them.

01:46.266 --> 01:47.233
Then why take them?

01:47.300 --> 01:48.667
To play army.

01:51.166 --> 01:52.633
And sometimes I like
to line them up

01:52.700 --> 01:55.433
around my bed
and pretend I'm Gulliver.

01:57.300 --> 01:59.667
Blanche, you put yourself
through hell every year.

01:59.734 --> 02:00.967
Are you sure it's worth it?

02:01.033 --> 02:02.667
Of course it is.

02:02.734 --> 02:05.600
Every anniversary
since I was married,

02:05.667 --> 02:08.834
I've slipped into my wedding dress
and had my picture taken.

02:08.900 --> 02:11.734
George was proud of me
for staying svelte.

02:11.800 --> 02:15.266
I'll fit into that dress this year
if it kills me.

02:15.333 --> 02:18.000
It's not you I'm worried about.
The last time you went on a diet,

02:18.066 --> 02:20.767
you turned into that guy
from <i>Silence of the Lambs.</i>

02:22.600 --> 02:24.934
You did everything
but butter my face.

02:25.633 --> 02:27.667
It's going to be different this time.

02:27.734 --> 02:30.066
I'm on this drink-it-off diet.

02:30.133 --> 02:33.700
You have two shakes
and a sensible meal.

02:33.767 --> 02:35.834
You lose weight the fast, easy way.

02:35.900 --> 02:37.800
I prefer the Italian diet.

02:37.867 --> 02:40.433
You drink wine,
make a smart remark,

02:40.500 --> 02:42.100
then get your jaw wired.

02:44.166 --> 02:47.000
Dorothy, a man called for you
while you were out.

02:47.066 --> 02:51.433
Finally. We can break out that bottle
of champagne we've been saving.

02:51.500 --> 02:52.567
Ma.

02:52.633 --> 02:55.900
Dorothy, we might
not get another chance.

02:55.967 --> 02:59.233
Sure, we will.
We can serve it at the wake.

03:05.367 --> 03:09.000
He's in Miami on business
and wants to see you.

03:09.800 --> 03:12.400
John Noretti called.

03:12.467 --> 03:15.500
I haven't heard from him
in almost 40 years.

03:15.567 --> 03:16.767
I can't believe this.

03:16.834 --> 03:18.633
Who's John Noretti?

03:18.700 --> 03:21.834
He's a guy who humiliated me.

03:21.900 --> 03:24.934
Could you narrow it
down a bit, Dorothy?

03:28.200 --> 03:30.667
He's the guy who stood me up
for my senior prom.

03:30.734 --> 03:33.700
Oh, Dorothy, I had no idea
you were stood up

03:33.767 --> 03:37.333
for your prom.
Oh, that's awful.

03:37.400 --> 03:39.033
I figured you didn't go,

03:39.100 --> 03:41.633
but to be stood up...

03:42.633 --> 03:45.300
John Noretti was one
of the toughest guys

03:45.367 --> 03:47.333
in my high school.
He smoked, he drank,

03:47.400 --> 03:50.834
he made those rude noises
under his armpit.

03:52.800 --> 03:55.333
I was totally in love with him,

03:55.400 --> 03:58.834
and when he asked me
to the senior prom,

03:58.900 --> 04:00.834
I was thrilled.

04:00.900 --> 04:03.567
When I came down the stairs
all dressed,

04:03.633 --> 04:08.100
ma cried because
her little girl was grown up,

04:08.166 --> 04:10.934
and she remarked that that night
would always be

04:11.000 --> 04:13.834
the most memorable
and important night

04:13.900 --> 04:16.400
the two of us ever shared.
Remember, Ma?

04:16.467 --> 04:17.934
Vaguely.

04:20.266 --> 04:22.367
But John never showed up.

04:22.433 --> 04:23.800
I've never forgotten it,

04:23.867 --> 04:25.834
but apparently he has,

04:25.900 --> 04:28.033
or he wouldn't have had
the nerve to call here.

04:28.100 --> 04:31.300
-You're not calling him, are you?
-Absolutely.

04:31.367 --> 04:33.600
If John's in Miami, I want to see him.

04:33.667 --> 04:36.066
That's not such a good idea.

04:36.133 --> 04:38.600
Ma, don't you see?

04:38.667 --> 04:41.233
I'm finally going to get my revenge.

04:41.300 --> 04:44.233
He's going to see a beautiful,
vibrant woman

04:44.300 --> 04:46.133
who's done something with her life.

04:46.200 --> 04:49.633
Well, Dorothy,
I'd like to help, but...

04:52.100 --> 04:56.300
I can't go out with him
on such short notice.

04:57.066 --> 05:01.133
I meant done something
with her life standing up.

05:02.500 --> 05:03.800
(Dorothy) I'm talking about me.

05:04.533 --> 05:07.433
My revenge will be
to make John feel

05:07.500 --> 05:09.033
as bad as he made me feel.

05:09.100 --> 05:12.000
I want him to see me,
see my life,

05:12.066 --> 05:14.633
so he'll know exactly what he missed.

05:15.567 --> 05:19.100
She doesn't know
a whole lot about revenge.

05:24.667 --> 05:26.967
Well, I'm ready for John.

05:27.033 --> 05:29.667
I've waited a long time for this night.

05:29.734 --> 05:32.266
I'm begging you.
Don't go out with him.

05:32.333 --> 05:34.233
He'll hurt you again.

05:34.300 --> 05:35.900
I'm not going out with him.

05:35.967 --> 05:38.133
You said you'd make him suffer.

05:38.200 --> 05:40.200
Don't you have to date a man
to do that?

05:42.600 --> 05:43.567
Not this time.

05:43.633 --> 05:47.533
No. I have my plan
all worked out step by step.

05:47.600 --> 05:49.900
First, he'll comment
on how stunning I look,

05:49.967 --> 05:53.800
then I'll say, "Oh, John,
did we have a date tonight?

05:53.867 --> 05:56.166
I completely forgot."

05:56.233 --> 06:00.233
As he crumbles,
I will show him the door.

06:00.300 --> 06:03.900
What if he doesn't comment
on how stunning you look?

06:03.967 --> 06:05.767
Then you'll bring it up.

06:09.433 --> 06:11.033
Time for my shake.

06:11.100 --> 06:12.767
Honey, how are you doing
with this diet?

06:12.834 --> 06:15.500
Oh, no problem. Piece of cake.

06:15.567 --> 06:18.133
Nice big piece
of chocolate cake.

06:20.133 --> 06:22.767
Devil's food, smothered
in whipped cream

06:22.834 --> 06:25.133
and coconut flakes and a lobster.

06:25.200 --> 06:26.166
(Dorothy) Blanche.

06:27.800 --> 06:29.834
Oh, I'm fine, I'm fine.

06:29.900 --> 06:33.533
Ooh, a wonderful
strawberry shake.

06:36.100 --> 06:37.900
Strawberry, mmm.

06:37.967 --> 06:40.066
I bet that'd go great with a burger.

06:41.600 --> 06:44.333
Ma, you're being a little
insensitive, aren't you?

06:44.400 --> 06:46.400
A little. Who wants an eclair?

06:48.100 --> 06:49.467
(doorbell rings)

06:49.533 --> 06:51.433
Oh, God, that's John.

06:51.500 --> 06:54.567
Oh, I just hope I can be mean enough.

06:54.633 --> 06:57.934
Dorothy, do what you do to me
in the morning

06:58.000 --> 07:00.333
when I take bacon off your plate.

07:03.100 --> 07:05.166
Blanche,
I wanna tell you something.

07:05.233 --> 07:06.934
I've never weighed
more than a hundred pounds

07:07.000 --> 07:08.767
on any day of my adult life.

07:08.834 --> 07:11.200
And because you're my friend
I want you to sit down,

07:11.266 --> 07:13.834
and I'll share with you
that secret.

07:13.900 --> 07:15.600
Uh-huh. Tell me, Sophia.

07:15.667 --> 07:17.734
I was born that way.

07:19.233 --> 07:21.567
I could eat anything
and never get fat.

07:23.166 --> 07:26.367
Did anyone ever tell you
you look like George Kirby?

07:32.433 --> 07:34.166
No, no. Wait. Wait.

07:34.233 --> 07:36.633
It's time that John Noretti
learned a lesson.

07:36.700 --> 07:38.567
I'm not that same little girl

07:38.633 --> 07:43.667
whose head can be turned by a pair of
beautiful eyes and killer smile.

07:43.734 --> 07:44.900
(doorbell rings)

07:44.967 --> 07:46.200
Now.

07:48.433 --> 07:49.967
Dorothy.

07:50.033 --> 07:51.533
Dorothy, look at you.

07:51.600 --> 07:53.800
You're as beautiful now
as you were then.

07:53.867 --> 07:55.367
I love you.

08:00.567 --> 08:01.600
(John) What?

08:04.200 --> 08:05.633
I, uh...

08:05.700 --> 08:09.700
I'd love you to meet my, uh,
friend, uh, Rose.

08:09.767 --> 08:11.166
Hi, John Noretti.

08:11.233 --> 08:13.300
Shall we go?
We've got reservations at 8:30.

08:13.367 --> 08:14.400
Take me.

08:17.667 --> 08:18.767
Out.

08:18.834 --> 08:21.066
-Take me out for dinner.
-Sure.

08:23.567 --> 08:24.533
Dorothy.

08:26.934 --> 08:28.467
I thought you were going
to make him suffer.

08:28.533 --> 08:30.800
I will. Tomorrow morning I'll tell him

08:30.867 --> 08:33.200
he's the worst lover I've ever had.

08:45.867 --> 08:47.767
Hope you like medieval food.

08:47.834 --> 08:51.400
I do. I'm glad I didn't have it
for lunch.

08:54.000 --> 08:55.266
Good evening, my lord.

08:55.333 --> 08:56.767
Good evening, my lady.

08:56.834 --> 08:57.834
I am Don.

08:57.900 --> 09:00.800
I will be your fool
for the entire evening.

09:02.066 --> 09:03.867
Would you like our specials?

09:03.934 --> 09:06.066
We have pheasant and wild boar.

09:06.133 --> 09:07.200
How is the pheasant?

09:07.266 --> 09:08.934
Do you like chicken?

09:09.000 --> 09:09.867
Yes.

09:09.934 --> 09:11.266
It's chicken.

09:11.333 --> 09:14.266
Bring us a couple of grogs
while we decide.

09:14.333 --> 09:16.834
Diet grog if you have it.

-Why?

09:40.667 --> 09:44.066
Well, I remember you as that
tough kid in the leather jacket.

09:44.133 --> 09:45.767
Fights, vandalism.

09:45.834 --> 09:48.033
You were really
a juvenile delinquent.

09:50.300 --> 09:52.633

how... how lovely--

10:30.734 --> 10:32.400
Could we meet Friday night?

10:32.467 --> 10:37.233
I can't. The high school where I teach
has their prom.

10:37.300 --> 10:38.667
I promised I'd chaperon.

10:38.734 --> 10:39.667
Can you bring a date?

10:39.734 --> 10:41.467
You can't be serious.

10:41.533 --> 10:42.934
I'll buy you a corsage.

10:43.000 --> 10:44.400
Make it orchids,

10:44.467 --> 10:47.834
and make sure
you show up this time.

10:47.900 --> 10:48.800
What do you mean?

10:48.867 --> 10:51.066
You didn't show up
at our last prom.

10:51.133 --> 10:53.133
Not that I care.

10:53.200 --> 10:55.700
-What do you mean? I showed up.
-What?

10:56.700 --> 10:58.100
Your mother sent me away.

10:58.166 --> 10:59.166
She what?

10:59.233 --> 11:02.367
She called me a bum

Ma, come back.

11:37.400 --> 11:39.800
I want to sit and have a little talk.

11:39.867 --> 11:41.000
Why?

11:41.967 --> 11:42.834
Come on, now.

11:42.900 --> 11:45.867
Would it hurt to spend time
with your daughter?

11:45.934 --> 11:47.934
That remains to be seen.

11:48.000 --> 11:51.467
Rose, would you excuse us
just for a minute?

I'll believe you.

Did you tell John Noretti to leave
the night of my senior prom

12:13.467 --> 12:17.000

the way he was dressed?

12:17.066 --> 12:18.834
-Well...
-Liar!

12:20.967 --> 12:23.433
You knew John showed up that night.

12:23.500 --> 12:25.133
You didn't want me seeing him tonight,

12:25.200 --> 12:26.633
because you knew he'd mention it.

12:26.700 --> 12:30.767
I can explain. Just don't put me
in another ill-equipped nursing home.

12:30.834 --> 12:32.967
I promise nothing.

12:34.033 --> 12:35.834
It's true. I sent him away

12:35.900 --> 12:39.533
because he was dressed like a hood.

12:39.600 --> 12:41.033
I told him not to come back

12:41.100 --> 12:43.400
until he was wearing
a jacket and a tie.

12:43.467 --> 12:44.934
Why didn't you tell me?

12:45.000 --> 12:47.066
When he didn't come back,

12:47.133 --> 12:48.934
I was afraid if you
knew the truth,

12:49.000 --> 12:50.934
you'd never forgive me.

12:51.000 --> 12:53.266
It's over. What's the big deal?

12:53.333 --> 12:54.934
Stanley Zbornak, Ma.

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
That's the big deal.

12:57.066 --> 12:58.767
When John didn't show up,

12:58.834 --> 13:01.000
I lost all my self-esteem.

13:01.066 --> 13:04.266
When Stan asked me out I said yes,

13:04.333 --> 13:07.500
because I didn't think
I'd do any better.

13:07.567 --> 13:10.233
That's why I went to
that drive-in movie with Stan.

13:10.300 --> 13:14.166
That's why I got pregnant
and why I got married.

13:14.233 --> 13:17.166
You're saying I kept you
from marrying John Noretti.

13:17.233 --> 13:18.900
I don't know. Maybe.

13:18.967 --> 13:23.333
Or maybe I would have met
somebody else, somebody wonderful,

13:23.400 --> 13:25.967
but I'll never know, because of you.

13:26.033 --> 13:28.700
You took away my choices.

13:28.767 --> 13:31.233
How can I forgive you for that?

13:38.633 --> 13:41.266
(tranquil music playing)

13:53.633 --> 13:56.667
Time for today's sensible meal.

13:59.467 --> 14:02.600
Where's my tuna quiche?

14:02.667 --> 14:03.633
You heard me.

14:03.700 --> 14:06.834
I said, "Where's my tuna quiche?"

14:06.900 --> 14:08.734
I get five ounces of solid food.

14:08.800 --> 14:11.166
I want my tuna quiche.

14:11.233 --> 14:13.834
You mean that little pie?

14:13.900 --> 14:14.967
Little pie.

14:15.033 --> 14:16.967
-Little pie?
-I wanted a snack.

14:17.033 --> 14:19.066
A snack!

14:19.133 --> 14:20.934
I thought it was a little fishy.

14:21.000 --> 14:25.533
You ate my sensible meal!
You ate my sensible meal!

14:25.600 --> 14:27.467
Blanche, stop! Blanche!

14:27.533 --> 14:29.300
You're out of control.

14:29.367 --> 14:32.467
My God. Oh, Rose, honey, I'm sorry.

14:32.533 --> 14:34.133
What did I just do?

14:34.200 --> 14:35.333
This.

14:35.400 --> 14:37.633
-Oh.
-Ah!

14:41.867 --> 14:44.066
Honey, we know dieting is hard.

14:44.133 --> 14:46.033
We've all been there.

14:46.100 --> 14:47.867
I remember the time Stan and I

14:47.934 --> 14:50.633
went on that weight loss
through sex diet.

14:50.700 --> 14:53.500
The idea being,
every time you felt hungry,

14:53.567 --> 14:56.567
you would substitute food
with some sexual activity.

14:56.633 --> 14:59.400
-Did it work?
-I gained 18 pounds.

15:04.400 --> 15:07.133
Well, fine. I won't have
my sensible meal.

15:07.200 --> 15:08.400
Tomorrow's my anniversary anyway.

15:08.467 --> 15:10.200
I'll just have my last shake tonight.

15:16.133 --> 15:17.166
Where's my shake?

15:27.266 --> 15:30.333
You heard me.
I said, "Where's my shake?"

15:30.400 --> 15:33.600
I needed something
to wash down the little pie.

15:33.667 --> 15:35.367
Aah!

15:35.433 --> 15:37.100
It was so fishy.

15:37.166 --> 15:39.066
I don't believe you.

15:39.133 --> 15:42.734
Well, if it's any consolation,
I'm still hungry.

15:43.700 --> 15:45.200
Oh, shut up.

15:45.266 --> 15:47.900
Just shut up, you babbling,
bubble-headed,

15:47.967 --> 15:49.567
bleached blonde...

15:49.633 --> 15:51.767
-Baboon.
-Baboon.

16:01.834 --> 16:04.100
She needed a "B".

16:06.767 --> 16:09.433
(doorbell ringing)

16:14.166 --> 16:16.667
John. Oh. I'll go get Dorothy.

16:16.734 --> 16:17.834
Won't you have a seat?

16:17.900 --> 16:20.834
Mrs. Petrillo.

16:20.900 --> 16:22.834
It's John Noretti.

16:22.900 --> 16:25.700
Well, you haven't aged a bit.

16:28.400 --> 16:31.200
I said you haven't aged a bit.

16:33.367 --> 16:35.533
I hear you, I'm not deaf.

16:35.600 --> 16:38.934
"Haven't staged a hit"?

16:39.734 --> 16:41.967
Oh, John, I'm sorry I kept you waiting.

16:42.033 --> 16:42.934
Dorothy.

16:43.000 --> 16:47.400
You remember my lying,
vicious toad of a mother.

16:48.867 --> 16:51.066
-Is there a problem?
-Oh, not at all.

16:51.133 --> 16:54.500
Happy as ever at happiness house.

16:54.567 --> 16:57.867
Aw. Well, I guess
we should be going.

16:57.934 --> 17:00.200
-I want a picture.
-Oh, Rose.

17:00.266 --> 17:03.300
Come on, Dorothy,
it's your prom picture.

17:03.367 --> 17:04.300
Say cheese.

17:04.367 --> 17:05.700
Cheese.

17:05.767 --> 17:06.900
Now smile.

17:10.834 --> 17:13.700
We'll save a lot of time
if you just do it.

17:13.767 --> 17:14.700
(clicks)

17:14.767 --> 17:16.667
Have a good time.

17:16.734 --> 17:17.934
Thank you.

17:18.033 --> 17:20.800
I never went to the St. Olaf
junior prom.

17:20.867 --> 17:21.767
How come?

17:21.834 --> 17:24.233
It was just for people named junior.

17:33.166 --> 17:35.200
It fits.

17:35.266 --> 17:37.200
My wedding dress fits.

17:38.066 --> 17:40.033
Congratulations.

17:40.100 --> 17:42.066
You weren't married in a white dress?

17:42.133 --> 17:45.066
Rose, it's one thing
to hear snickering

17:45.133 --> 17:47.867
when you walk down the aisle,
but me in white?

17:47.934 --> 17:51.166
Even I couldn't keep
a straight face.

17:53.600 --> 17:56.266
Okay, Rose, come on.
Take the picture.

17:56.333 --> 17:57.367
(clicks)

17:58.066 --> 18:00.734
I never thought you'd fit
into that thing.

18:00.800 --> 18:03.533
The pain was worth it.

18:03.600 --> 18:05.400
George would be proud of me.

18:05.467 --> 18:07.500
My body's as lithe and taut

18:07.567 --> 18:10.133
as the day we were wed.

18:10.200 --> 18:12.233
Blanche!

18:14.367 --> 18:15.567
Nothing.

18:17.400 --> 18:18.700
(clicks)

18:24.867 --> 18:26.266
It was an enchanting evening.

18:26.333 --> 18:28.166
Enchanted evening.

18:28.233 --> 18:31.700
The was the theme
of that prom we never got to.

18:31.767 --> 18:34.433
More romantic than the theme
they had tonight.

18:34.500 --> 18:38.100
Wear a condom
is more than a prom theme.

18:38.166 --> 18:41.166
It's sort of become
the school slogan.

18:41.233 --> 18:43.066
It's catchy.

18:43.133 --> 18:47.333
I wish Stan had gone
to that high school.

18:47.400 --> 18:49.834
I've got a little confession
to make.

18:49.900 --> 18:51.800
I wanted to see you again

18:51.867 --> 18:54.600
to show you how well I turned out.

18:54.667 --> 18:57.700
I wanted to show you
the same thing.

18:57.767 --> 18:59.166
I was a mess in high school.

18:59.233 --> 19:00.467
We all were.

19:00.533 --> 19:06.033
Except for Roseanne Dorasmo.
She had it all together.

19:06.100 --> 19:07.900
I wonder whatever happened to her.

19:07.967 --> 19:11.867
She turned into a bitter lonely lady

19:11.934 --> 19:14.166
who came into a lot of money.

19:14.233 --> 19:16.767
At least that's how she was
after our divorce.

19:18.633 --> 19:20.767
I had a wonderful time tonight.

19:20.834 --> 19:23.133
So did I.

19:23.200 --> 19:25.433
I'm sorry I messed up in high school.

19:25.500 --> 19:28.100
It wasn't your fault.
It was my mother's.

19:28.166 --> 19:31.133
Actually I've always wanted to
thank her for that night.

19:31.200 --> 19:32.567
Why?

19:32.633 --> 19:35.500
For not letting me take you out.

19:35.567 --> 19:39.700
She took one look at my clothes
and my attitude,

19:39.767 --> 19:43.900
and she said her little girl
deserved better.

19:43.967 --> 19:45.533
She actually said that?

19:45.600 --> 19:49.633
Yeah, and a whole lot
of Italian words.

19:49.700 --> 19:51.433
I'm not sure if it was a curse,

19:51.500 --> 19:54.400
but I did talk like a girl
for three weeks.

19:55.667 --> 19:58.033
It was a turning point in my life.

19:58.100 --> 19:59.934
I finally started growing up.

20:00.000 --> 20:02.700
All that happened
because of my mother?

20:02.767 --> 20:04.633
I like to think so.

20:04.700 --> 20:07.266
Another thing I remember
about that night

20:07.333 --> 20:09.266
was how nervous I was.

20:09.333 --> 20:11.266
Nervous about what?

20:11.333 --> 20:12.667
Our good night kiss.

20:12.734 --> 20:14.333
I was terrified.

20:14.400 --> 20:17.567
I thought, she's not
going to want me--

20:23.633 --> 20:25.300
It was worth waiting for.

20:27.400 --> 20:29.734
Can I call you next time
I get back to town?

20:29.800 --> 20:31.033
I'd like that.

20:32.867 --> 20:34.567
Good night.

20:50.500 --> 20:52.934
Don't take me, death.
Don't take me.

20:55.200 --> 20:56.266
Oh, it's you.

20:56.333 --> 20:57.800
Ma, are you okay?

20:57.867 --> 20:59.800
Yeah, I'm fine.

20:59.867 --> 21:02.567
Oh, Ma, I said some terrible things
to you,

21:02.633 --> 21:04.367
and I'm sorry.

21:04.433 --> 21:08.533
I'm responsible for the decisions
I made in my life,

21:08.600 --> 21:10.700
and if my life didn't turn out
perfectly,

21:10.767 --> 21:13.066
well, whose has?

21:13.133 --> 21:14.834
Mary Ann Mobley comes to mind.

21:14.900 --> 21:19.200
She gets to sleep with Gary Collins
every night.

21:19.266 --> 21:21.133
I'm trying to say

21:21.200 --> 21:24.233
we all make the best decisions
we can make

21:24.300 --> 21:25.800
with what we know.

21:25.867 --> 21:27.467
Exactly.

21:27.533 --> 21:30.100
Just like on the night
of your prom.

21:30.166 --> 21:32.233
I did what I thought best.

21:32.300 --> 21:34.367
I was wrong, I'm sorry,

21:34.433 --> 21:37.166
but you didn't come
with a book of instructions.

21:37.233 --> 21:40.033
I only wanted the best
for my little girl.

21:40.100 --> 21:41.767
You deserved it.

21:41.834 --> 21:43.867
I didn't want you
to settle for less.

21:43.934 --> 21:47.433
You still think of me
as your little girl?

21:47.500 --> 21:49.000
Of course I do.

21:49.066 --> 21:51.400
In fact... come on.

21:55.266 --> 21:58.767
Sit on my lap
for old time's sake.

21:58.834 --> 22:01.667
Come on, Ma.
You can't be serious.

22:01.734 --> 22:03.867
I mean,
I'm a grown woman.

22:03.934 --> 22:06.967
What's wrong with a mother
wanting to hold her child?

22:07.033 --> 22:09.266
Dorothy, do this to me.
Sit on my lap.

22:19.734 --> 22:22.400
Well, if you're sure, I...

22:28.367 --> 22:30.367
Oh, Ma.

22:30.433 --> 22:33.834
Oh, this brings back
so many memories.

22:33.900 --> 22:35.500
The time I was 5.

22:35.567 --> 22:37.800
Bad idea. Bad idea.

22:40.133 --> 22:41.166
Ma, are you all right?

22:41.233 --> 22:44.233
I'm fine.
I just panicked for a minute.

22:45.333 --> 22:46.867
Come sit down here.

22:49.367 --> 22:53.000
Oh, Ma, this is just
like old times.

22:53.066 --> 22:54.867
So, tell me, did you
have a good time tonight

22:54.934 --> 22:56.033
at your prom, pussycat?

22:56.100 --> 23:00.300
Wonderful, Ma.
It was everything I wanted it to be.

23:00.367 --> 23:04.033
Come. Tell ma all about it.

23:04.100 --> 23:10.000
Well, John bought me this
beautiful corsage,

23:10.066 --> 23:12.400
and then when we got
to the gymnasium,

23:12.467 --> 23:14.867
it was so beautiful.

23:14.934 --> 23:18.333
Anyway, when we got there, we walked in...

23:18.400 --> 23:22.500
(soft music)

23:24.433 --> 23:27.867
(theme music playing)
