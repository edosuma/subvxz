Got a green thumb

00:53.855 --> 00:55.802
Or a green fry, l guess.

00:58.009 --> 00:59.946
How about you come over
and take a dip,

01:00.016 --> 01:01.963
cool off, beat the heat?

01:02.023 --> 01:03.519
- Nah.
No thanks, Carl.

01:03.599 --> 01:05.546
l, uh, l did get rid
of the water moccasins.

01:08.526 --> 01:10.092
there's something else
down there

01:10.162 --> 01:12.139
that l can't explain.

01:12.209 --> 01:14.206
But you don't bother it,
it don't bother you.

01:16.494 --> 01:17.989
Yeah, l'm planting
a row of trees

01:18.070 --> 01:20.006
so l ain't gotta look at that
mosquito breeding ground

01:20.077 --> 01:21.140
that you're running
over there.

01:21.211 --> 01:22.746
Oh, listen to you.
Here we go.

01:22.826 --> 01:24.321
Relax, it's cool.

01:24.392 --> 01:26.529
l filled the pool with DEET,
and that'll kill anything.

01:26.609 --> 01:27.543
- Hey, Carl.

01:27.613 --> 01:30.212
DEET DEET,
DEET DEET DEET DEET.

01:30.292 --> 01:31.848
l like saying DEET.

01:33.604 --> 01:35.410
DEET DEET, DEET DEET...

01:35.481 --> 01:38.622
Well, just so you know,
l called the city about it.

01:38.692 --> 01:42.365
Oh, yeah? Well, l called
the city on you, too!

01:42.445 --> 01:44.211
And your filthy, uh,
trees there.

01:44.281 --> 01:45.345
SHAKE:
What the hell are you planting?

01:45.425 --> 01:46.901
This is a rental!

01:46.961 --> 01:48.556
You don't get
your money back!

01:48.637 --> 01:52.611
Plus, l'm just gonna
chop those down.

01:52.691 --> 01:54.126
l may.

01:54.196 --> 01:55.531
You don't turn
your back on me.

01:55.601 --> 01:58.511
- DEET, DEET, DEET, DEET, DEET,
DEET, DEET, DEET, DEET, DEET...

02:00.087 --> 02:01.421
What the --
Meatwad!

02:01.492 --> 02:03.970
He's gone.
That thing took him.

02:04.041 --> 02:05.777
Back up!
l'm going in after him.

02:05.847 --> 02:07.794
- Yes, go in
after him!

02:07.854 --> 02:09.800
- Wait. Ain't no [expletive] way
l'm going in after him.

02:09.871 --> 02:11.467
- He could
still be alive.

02:11.537 --> 02:13.915
lf you went in after him,
you'd know for sure.

02:13.986 --> 02:16.183
Carl! You wanna feed me
to that monster, don't you?

02:16.264 --> 02:18.291
Yeah.

02:18.371 --> 02:20.538
That's cold-blooded, Carl.
Damn!

02:20.619 --> 02:22.024
- Last one in's a rotten egg!
- Shake, no!

02:22.084 --> 02:23.388
Cannonball!

02:28.115 --> 02:30.684
Lower me slowly.
Over.

02:32.741 --> 02:34.236
MAN:
Hang on, here, tough guy.

02:36.625 --> 02:38.863
Oh, hey!
Terry.

02:38.933 --> 02:41.462
l thought we were conducting
this conference call

02:41.542 --> 02:43.138
tomorrow morning?

02:43.218 --> 02:44.854
Boss says he wants
it done now.

02:44.924 --> 02:46.690
Or he'll take
your other nut.

02:46.770 --> 02:48.537
Ha ha!
Listen to this guy!

02:48.607 --> 02:51.246
Busting my ball...s.

02:51.316 --> 02:52.882
Balls.
l got two.

02:52.962 --> 02:54.558
We ain't gotta talk
about this publicly.

02:54.638 --> 02:55.872
You know, maybe you
oughta think about that

02:55.943 --> 02:58.512
the next time you bet
20 Gs for the Jets to cover.

02:58.582 --> 03:01.502
Well, you told me
the inside dope was

03:01.562 --> 03:04.061
that the other team had
the flesh-eating virus.

03:04.141 --> 03:06.249
You getting smart with me?
Huh, smart guy?

03:06.319 --> 03:08.085
Wanna trip down
a flight of stairs, huh?

03:08.165 --> 03:09.761
Have an accident
in your pathetic life?

03:09.841 --> 03:12.250
You're pathetic.
Say it.

03:12.310 --> 03:14.317
l'm worth nothing
in your eyes, sir.

03:14.387 --> 03:15.662
l knew that.

03:15.732 --> 03:18.472
Now get your monster up here
to take care of this trash.

03:25.837 --> 03:27.784
Now, was that so hard?

03:27.854 --> 03:29.450
Say, before you guys go,

03:29.530 --> 03:30.965
who do you like

03:31.036 --> 03:33.404
in the A.C. Beach
lnvitational?

03:33.474 --> 03:35.421
- A.C. Beach?
- Women's billiards.

03:35.481 --> 03:37.328
You guys do a book
on that, right?

03:37.398 --> 03:39.696
[expletive],
you're a [expletive] loser.

03:39.776 --> 03:42.305
Scuba guy,
you ain't seen nothing,

03:42.385 --> 03:43.720
and you ain't heard nothing.

03:43.790 --> 03:45.817
See, Fryman,

03:45.898 --> 03:47.844
you gotta let that be
a lesson to you.

03:47.905 --> 03:49.510
lf you see someone
racketeering,

03:49.581 --> 03:51.116
you let it go.

03:51.186 --> 03:52.752
They're digging
their own grave.

03:52.832 --> 03:54.428
Look, Carl, l know
it's none of my business,

03:54.508 --> 03:56.244
but gambling is
a dangerous addiction.

03:56.314 --> 03:58.452
All l need is one run
and l'm back!

03:58.522 --> 04:00.117
You follow
women's billiards?

04:00.198 --> 04:02.195
Wait, l got an idea.

04:02.275 --> 04:03.871
How much money you got?
- No, Carl.

04:03.951 --> 04:05.286
- lt's a proven system!
- No, no.

04:05.356 --> 04:06.379
You're throwing money
away!

04:06.460 --> 04:07.794
Unh-unh, Carl.
Nope.

04:07.865 --> 04:10.102
Fine, stay a sucker!

04:10.173 --> 04:11.808
Carl, lower me
into the water.

04:14.357 --> 04:16.264
Okay, one more idea.

04:16.334 --> 04:19.074
You go kill them guys
with your eye lasers,

04:19.144 --> 04:22.185
then l feed you
to this monster.

04:22.265 --> 04:23.700
Carl, that makes
no sense.

04:23.770 --> 04:25.677
There ain't nothing
in it for me.

04:25.747 --> 04:28.156
Sure it does.
You do the thing, and then...

04:28.226 --> 04:30.795
why can't l get ahead?!

04:33.444 --> 04:35.511
Yeah!

04:35.592 --> 04:38.331
All right!

04:38.402 --> 04:40.138
Oh, hey there.

04:40.208 --> 04:42.245
Oh, man!
lt's amazing down there.

04:42.315 --> 04:43.921
Are you serious?

04:43.991 --> 04:45.968
We spent what seems like
seven lifetimes.

04:46.038 --> 04:48.537
We sure did.
lt was fun down there.

04:48.617 --> 04:51.056
Everything is a never-ending
Superbowl of pleasure!

04:51.126 --> 04:52.531
You should try it, Shake.

04:54.277 --> 04:55.833
Do they have
a big screen TV?

04:55.913 --> 04:58.251
The biggest!
lt's huge!

04:58.321 --> 04:59.766
Well, okay.

04:59.827 --> 05:01.131
- We rented
Michael Clayton, man.

05:01.202 --> 05:02.145
- Michael Clayton?

05:02.205 --> 05:03.148
On Blu-ray.

05:03.219 --> 05:04.613
How'd it look?

05:04.684 --> 05:06.390
We done saw every pore
in George Clooney's face, yo.

05:06.460 --> 05:08.838
Turn on the TV!
l'm coming, Michael!

05:14.197 --> 05:15.461
So it's cool
down there?

05:15.532 --> 05:16.866
Hell, no, man!

05:16.947 --> 05:19.114
lt's a pain unlike any
l've ever felt in my entire life.

05:19.185 --> 05:22.326
Oh, yeah, we was digested
and defecated.

05:22.396 --> 05:24.373
And digested
and defecated.

05:24.443 --> 05:25.537
And digested and defecated.

05:25.617 --> 05:27.353
Okay, okay,
l get the picture.

05:30.033 --> 05:32.170
There weren't no TV
down there.

05:32.240 --> 05:35.421
And l'm starting to think that
my hands are gone!

05:35.492 --> 05:37.087
No, l see one.

05:37.168 --> 05:38.432
Oh, never mind.

05:38.502 --> 05:40.278
All right,
we gonna go home now, Carl.

05:41.422 --> 05:43.329
Help me outta here,
will ya?

05:43.399 --> 05:45.567
We need to treat
that pool.

05:48.317 --> 05:50.083
Take this, you mother--
[grunts]

05:50.163 --> 05:51.598
Carl's gonna be
so happy

05:51.668 --> 05:52.933
and surprised

05:53.003 --> 05:54.950
and then happy,
and then surprised.

05:55.010 --> 05:56.616
And then happy
and then surprised.

05:56.686 --> 05:58.282
Then the surprise
will wear off

05:58.362 --> 06:01.031
'cause he will have
seen it for a time.

06:01.111 --> 06:03.410
But he'll still
be happy.

06:03.490 --> 06:05.517
- What did you do to my pool?
- FRYLOCK: We cleaned it.

06:05.597 --> 06:07.725
Now it's refreshing
and enjoyable

06:07.805 --> 06:09.501
for the bitches we gonn' have
coming over there this summer.

06:09.581 --> 06:11.147
- Frylock.
- Sorry, l meant to say hoes.

06:11.217 --> 06:12.812
- There we go.
- Sorry.

06:12.893 --> 06:15.131
Monster! Monster!

06:16.676 --> 06:18.272
- lt's dead.
- No, no!

06:18.352 --> 06:19.947
- We killed it
with chlorine.

06:20.028 --> 06:21.834
They're dropping off
a package tonight!

06:21.904 --> 06:23.239
Crime doesn't pay, Carl.

06:23.309 --> 06:24.473
Oh, yeah, it does.

06:24.544 --> 06:25.517
You ever seen
his watch?

06:25.587 --> 06:27.564
l have, and l want
a watch like that.

06:27.624 --> 06:29.601
l should pamper myself
more.

06:29.672 --> 06:32.010
His pinky ring's worth
more than my l-Roc.

06:32.080 --> 06:33.816
Them freaking guys
are loaded.

06:33.886 --> 06:35.923
And l want to be loaded.

06:35.994 --> 06:37.469
Loaded, you say?

06:37.539 --> 06:39.275
That gives me an idea.

06:41.352 --> 06:44.353
[expletive] sumo wrestlers.

06:44.433 --> 06:46.029
When l say take
a dive,

06:46.109 --> 06:49.250
you take a [expletive] dive,
you fat [expletive]!

06:49.320 --> 06:51.729
l don't think
he understood English.

06:51.799 --> 06:53.405
Well, he's about
to be sushi.

06:53.475 --> 06:55.071
So blow
the [expletive] horn.

06:56.857 --> 06:59.596
What the [expletive]?
The water looks clear.

06:59.667 --> 07:01.804
Where's that big
[expletive] fish?

07:01.884 --> 07:02.978
You rang?

07:04.694 --> 07:06.460
Yeah! Fryman!

07:06.531 --> 07:08.166
Relax, Carl.
They're only stunned.

07:08.247 --> 07:10.244
Just until the authorities
can arrive.

07:10.314 --> 07:12.261
Authorities!
Are you outta your mind?!

07:12.331 --> 07:14.167
Shoot 'em again!
ln the head!

07:14.238 --> 07:15.673
Nope, that's not
how l roll, dog.

07:15.743 --> 07:16.877
And you know it.

07:16.947 --> 07:18.543
Okay, now, when do l cut
off the fingertips?

07:18.623 --> 07:20.560
After l check
the teeth for gold!

07:20.630 --> 07:21.664
Take your eye lasers

07:21.734 --> 07:23.179
and cut their heads off!

07:23.239 --> 07:24.343
Carl, they have
your number,

07:24.413 --> 07:25.347
they know
where you live,

07:25.417 --> 07:26.621
and you still
owe them money.

07:26.691 --> 07:28.227
Hell, they'll send
someone else.

07:28.297 --> 07:29.632
That's why it's called
a mob.

07:29.702 --> 07:31.378
Oh, yeah.
Good point.

07:31.448 --> 07:33.425
This was not very well
thought-out, Carl.

07:33.485 --> 07:35.221
Porcelain!
Outrageous!

07:35.302 --> 07:38.242
Whoa, l feel a little
tug from this filter.

07:38.312 --> 07:40.690
This jet is, uh, quite
pleasurable, actually.

07:40.761 --> 07:42.356
- Jet?
[splash]

07:42.427 --> 07:44.032
Move over, it's my pool!

07:44.102 --> 07:45.838
- All right, damn!

07:48.588 --> 07:50.535
Look, guys,

07:50.595 --> 07:52.662
l need some alone time

07:52.743 --> 07:54.810
so l can think
about my past

07:54.890 --> 07:57.419
and some of the poor
choices l made.

07:58.734 --> 08:01.584
And so you can
[expletive] off in there?

08:01.654 --> 08:03.681
Yeah, yeah, maybe
[expletive] in here, too.

08:03.761 --> 08:05.929
All right,
let's beat it.

08:05.999 --> 08:07.635
Listen, y'all,
name this tune.

08:14.940 --> 08:16.747
You give up?

08:16.817 --> 08:18.764
Are you playing?
- No.

08:18.824 --> 08:20.390
''Toxic,'' Britney Spears.

08:20.470 --> 08:22.306
All right, we'll do
a different one.

08:26.631 --> 08:28.608
''Touch My Body,''
Mariah Carey.

08:28.669 --> 08:30.615
l changed the key, though.

08:30.676 --> 08:32.121
And the meter.

08:32.191 --> 08:34.389
And most of the words.

08:35.432 --> 08:37.469
All right,
let's play again.

08:43.299 --> 08:44.745
Oh, man.

08:44.815 --> 08:47.946
l think l just found
a girlfriend.

08:48.026 --> 08:50.023
The creature!
Let go! Let go! No!

08:50.104 --> 08:52.131
l am this creature
you speak of.

08:52.211 --> 08:53.736
And you destroyed
our civilization

08:53.817 --> 08:55.222
when you cleaned
the pool.

08:55.292 --> 08:57.821
And so l can never be
your eternal sex slave

08:57.901 --> 09:00.239
because of what you did
to my people,

09:00.309 --> 09:02.547
my fish people.

09:02.628 --> 09:04.364
That wasn't me.
That was him.

09:04.434 --> 09:06.170
Oh, okay,
that changes things.

09:06.240 --> 09:08.277
l will quickly disappear
inside your penis

09:08.348 --> 09:09.722
and give you
an indescribable pleasure

09:09.793 --> 09:12.161
beyond all description.

09:12.231 --> 09:13.827
All right, do it.

09:13.907 --> 09:15.172
- $30.

09:15.252 --> 09:16.687
$50 if you let
them watch.

09:16.757 --> 09:18.282
- Come on, go for it!
- Make it 50!

09:18.363 --> 09:20.059
SHAKE: 50, 50, 50!
- $30.

09:20.139 --> 09:22.407
Close the blinds
over there!

09:22.477 --> 09:24.113
Am l doing it?

09:27.505 --> 09:29.100
lt's starting
to itch now,

09:29.181 --> 09:30.445
itch real bad.

09:30.515 --> 09:31.750
Come back up here.

09:31.820 --> 09:33.767
Get outta my penis.
Hold on.

09:33.827 --> 09:34.770
Have you been tested?

09:34.840 --> 09:36.837
Tested for what?

09:39.828 --> 09:41.263
Now, hatch forth,
eggs.

09:41.333 --> 09:43.240
Grow and reform our
lost civilization.

09:43.310 --> 09:44.906
Aw, damn it!

09:44.986 --> 09:46.782
l slept with her ass, too.

09:48.428 --> 09:50.967
l told her l was saving
myself for marriage

09:51.037 --> 09:52.914
and that wouldn't
be right,

09:52.984 --> 09:54.550
and it'd screw up
my friendship,

09:54.630 --> 09:56.828
but she got me drunk
on red wine,

09:56.898 --> 09:58.804
and things lead to things,
and...

09:58.875 --> 10:00.039
yeah.

10:00.119 --> 10:03.621
- What are you trying to say?

10:03.702 --> 10:06.973
Whoa.
What the --

10:07.043 --> 10:09.652
Well, just for the record,

10:09.723 --> 10:11.198
l did her twice.

10:11.268 --> 10:13.295
And her friend.

10:13.375 --> 10:14.971
All over my jock

10:15.051 --> 10:17.962
like sexual animals.

10:21.343 --> 10:24.013
l cannot believe that
l haven't exploded yet.

10:24.093 --> 10:25.960
l'm probably just immune

10:26.030 --> 10:27.635
'cause l had so much
exposure

10:27.706 --> 10:29.703
to their butts
and sex.

10:31.459 --> 10:33.125
You really should hear
this story

10:33.195 --> 10:35.473
'cause it is incredible.

10:37.450 --> 10:40.862
Hey, hey guys?

10:40.932 --> 10:42.528
Hey, you wanna listen
to this story

10:42.608 --> 10:44.204
about when l had sex
underwater?!

10:44.284 --> 10:45.478
- Okay, okay!

10:45.558 --> 10:47.756
- l'm just walking by,
minding my own business,

10:47.826 --> 10:49.432
flexing my pecs.

10:49.502 --> 10:52.543
And this chick starts
getting all up in my face.

10:52.623 --> 10:54.419
- Yeah, yeah,
l'm listening.

10:54.490 --> 10:56.768
- And l'm like, ''Whoa, man.
l'm just out here for flexing.''

10:56.838 --> 10:59.246
and then she looked down
and said, ''lt looks like

10:59.316 --> 11:01.253
you're here for more
than flexing.''

11:01.324 --> 11:03.893
- Keep going.
Yeah, l'm listening.

11:03.973 --> 11:05.809
Two broads, huh?
- Yeah.

11:05.879 --> 11:07.375
They started sexing me
all up.

11:07.455 --> 11:08.980
Hey, that's a good idea
to cut those trees down,

11:09.061 --> 11:10.124
by the way.

11:10.195 --> 11:11.640
Then they took turns.

11:11.710 --> 11:13.376
Where do you want me to put
your balls, in a jar?

11:13.446 --> 11:14.510
Wait. What?

11:14.580 --> 11:16.426
Cut him down.
