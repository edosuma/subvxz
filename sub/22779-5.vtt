WEBVTT

00:06.548 --> 00:08.550
[wind howling]

00:13.012 --> 00:14.597
[Frank] Beautiful country, ain't it?

00:17.267 --> 00:20.437
Good Book says prosperity
is the path to godliness.

00:21.521 --> 00:23.273
That if God wanted man to be poor,

00:23.356 --> 00:25.442
he wouldn't have surrounded him
with so much bounty.

00:26.067 --> 00:28.028
Which Good Book are you referring to?

00:30.822 --> 00:33.366
You sure know
how to pick fine horseflesh, son.

00:36.077 --> 00:40.123
If you get to reading someday, you might
come across a fellow named Xenophon.

00:41.499 --> 00:42.500
Xenophon?

00:44.919 --> 00:47.797
Come on, Frank. Why don't you
just admit you make this stuff up?

00:47.881 --> 00:48.882
[chuckles]

00:49.424 --> 00:50.550
He was a Greek fellow.

00:50.633 --> 00:53.803
A student of Socrates
and, some say, the first real horseman.

00:55.388 --> 00:56.806
He believed that horses,

00:56.890 --> 00:58.683
being prey animals and all...

01:00.685 --> 01:02.187
their greatest instincts...

01:03.480 --> 01:05.273
were fear, flight...

01:06.608 --> 01:07.942
and, lastly, fight.

01:09.194 --> 01:10.320
So, on account of that,

01:10.403 --> 01:14.115
old Xenophon thought taming them
made more sense than breaking them.

01:14.991 --> 01:17.660
And that... rather than hauling

01:17.744 --> 01:19.037
and beating the animal...

01:19.621 --> 01:20.872
he would use a bit of rope...

01:23.374 --> 01:24.834
some gentle restraint...

01:27.921 --> 01:28.922
and kindness.

01:31.925 --> 01:33.051
Do it that way.

01:39.557 --> 01:41.976
Not natural for a horse to be laid down.

01:43.978 --> 01:46.231
Makes him amenable, but full of fear.

01:48.858 --> 01:52.028
Makes it hard for him to do
what he wants to do, which is bolt.

01:52.987 --> 01:54.322
So he's got to trust you.

01:55.865 --> 01:57.575
Despite what some men think...

01:59.494 --> 02:02.205
it's not just about
showing him who's boss.

02:03.248 --> 02:06.584
It's about showing him that you're the one
who's gonna feed him...

02:07.669 --> 02:08.795
and water him.

02:12.257 --> 02:14.134
You're the one
who's gonna take care of him.

02:17.846 --> 02:19.639
[horse nickers]

02:21.057 --> 02:22.308
It's about showing him...

02:27.063 --> 02:28.231
that he can trust you.

02:29.107 --> 02:30.525
Always and forever.

02:41.619 --> 02:43.246
[gunshot]

02:51.963 --> 02:54.090
Move, boy,
and I'll open your fucking head.

02:56.593 --> 02:58.970
[Frank] That was a fine animal
you just shot.

02:59.846 --> 03:01.639
My name is Ben Broome,

03:01.723 --> 03:05.310
and I own a spread
about 60 miles east of here

03:05.393 --> 03:07.186
called the Double B.

03:07.270 --> 03:08.271
Lucky you.

03:08.855 --> 03:10.189
Maybe you can tell me, sir,

03:10.273 --> 03:14.193
how it happens
that them there horses grazing yonder

03:14.277 --> 03:16.279
all got my brand on them?

03:18.114 --> 03:19.782
They must have just wandered off.

03:19.866 --> 03:20.950
[Ben chuckles] Oh...

03:21.034 --> 03:24.287
That they did, with a little help
from you and your son there.

03:25.330 --> 03:27.373
You accusing me of something, Mr. Broome?

03:27.457 --> 03:28.458
Oh, no, sir.

03:28.541 --> 03:32.337
I'm too busy and too damn tired
to waste that kind of time,

03:32.420 --> 03:36.341
so I'm just gonna hang the both of ya
and be done with it.

03:44.140 --> 03:45.183
[Frank sighs]

03:45.266 --> 03:47.310
This ain't my death, boys.

03:49.604 --> 03:51.606
Don't be afraid, son. I'm right here.

03:52.148 --> 03:52.982
[chokes]

03:53.066 --> 03:54.067
[horse grunts]

03:58.196 --> 04:00.782
Come on, get it done.
We gotta round up them horses over--

04:00.865 --> 04:01.699
[gunshot]

04:01.783 --> 04:03.243
[splutters]

04:04.661 --> 04:05.787
[body thuds]

04:08.164 --> 04:08.998
[Gatz] Now...

04:09.707 --> 04:11.417
if the rest of you want to live...

04:11.876 --> 04:14.254
you'll unbuckle them belts
and throw them into the brush.

04:20.718 --> 04:21.761
[horse whinnies]

04:21.844 --> 04:23.096
[Roy gasps]

04:23.179 --> 04:24.889
[choking]

04:27.350 --> 04:28.810
What took you so damn long?

04:28.893 --> 04:32.063
That stream
was positively afire with trout.

04:32.814 --> 04:33.815
[choking]

04:33.898 --> 04:34.899
[grunts]

04:36.567 --> 04:38.361
[grunts and wheezes]

04:39.028 --> 04:40.905
You just ask and they would bite.

04:43.199 --> 04:45.618
I ain't ever seen a thing like it
in my whole life.

04:45.702 --> 04:46.536
[grunts]

04:48.162 --> 04:49.163
[coughs]

04:55.837 --> 04:57.463
[panting]

04:58.339 --> 04:59.757
[Ben groans]

05:03.720 --> 05:04.554
Frank.

05:05.346 --> 05:07.598
[Frank]
Where are you running to, Mr. Broome?

05:14.439 --> 05:15.440
[grunts]

05:16.399 --> 05:17.567
You best kill him, son.

05:19.193 --> 05:23.031
Mr. Broome don't strike me as the type
of fella who forgives and forgets,

05:23.114 --> 05:25.366
and I don't much like
looking over my shoulder.

05:25.450 --> 05:26.826
[Ben groans]

05:29.245 --> 05:31.414
The man was gonna hang
the only kin you had...

05:33.291 --> 05:34.751
without so much as a nod.

05:37.128 --> 05:38.629
Family's everything, son.

05:38.713 --> 05:40.339
Without family, we're lost.

05:42.675 --> 05:43.801
Do you trust me, son?

05:47.096 --> 05:48.556
'Cause I ain't your brother.

05:49.390 --> 05:50.892
I will never leave you.

05:50.975 --> 05:51.976
Not ever.

05:52.560 --> 05:53.644
You understand?

05:57.774 --> 05:58.941
Now, do as you're told.

06:03.404 --> 06:04.822
[exhales]

06:15.625 --> 06:17.251
[thunder rumbles]

06:21.339 --> 06:22.340
Keep it.

06:23.216 --> 06:24.217
It's yours now.

06:26.302 --> 06:28.304
[thunder rumbles]

06:34.143 --> 06:36.145
[instrumental theme music plays]

07:32.410 --> 07:35.079
I'm not used to such strong spirits.

07:35.163 --> 07:36.247
Well...

07:36.330 --> 07:39.208
a lady should never walk home alone
in the night.

07:39.709 --> 07:40.710
Least of all...

07:41.252 --> 07:43.754
go into a darkened house all by herself.

07:43.838 --> 07:45.131
Oh, it's all right.

07:45.214 --> 07:47.758
Mrs. Ehrlich
is sitting up with Luke tonight.

07:47.842 --> 07:49.719
I'm sure she lit a lantern for me.

07:50.553 --> 07:51.554
Luke?

07:52.138 --> 07:53.347
My baby.

07:53.431 --> 07:55.892
I told you about him, how he almost died.

07:55.975 --> 07:58.978
Yes, of course.
You thought he had the fever or something.

07:59.061 --> 08:00.396
Rubella.

08:00.480 --> 08:03.065
But it was that terrible snake
that almost got him.

08:03.566 --> 08:06.611
If it wasn't for Mr. Ward,
he'd be dead, for sure.

08:07.111 --> 08:08.488
Now, who's Mr. Ward?

08:09.489 --> 08:12.408
A young man helping Alice Fletcher
with her horses.

08:12.492 --> 08:14.494
Oh, Alice Fletcher.

08:14.577 --> 08:15.786
[chuckles] Of course.

08:16.787 --> 08:20.249
The woman that married a savage,
stole her parcel from Mr. Leopold,

08:20.333 --> 08:23.044
had his sons killed
and put a curse on the whole town.

08:23.127 --> 08:24.212
How could I forget?

08:24.295 --> 08:26.047
About almost none of that is true.

08:26.756 --> 08:28.799
I don't believe Alice is evil,

08:28.883 --> 08:31.219
but I do think the old lady has powers.

08:31.302 --> 08:32.345
Mr. Ward.

08:34.514 --> 08:35.598
Tell me about him.

08:36.682 --> 08:38.976
He shot the head off a sidewinder...

08:39.560 --> 08:42.188
that was about to sink his wicked fangs
into my boy.

08:43.397 --> 08:44.941
Shot the head off a snake?

08:45.024 --> 08:47.652
Yes, sir, from across the room.

08:48.569 --> 08:50.029
Well, that is some shooting.

10:13.904 --> 10:17.158
[Roy]  "Untro... Untrod...

10:17.241 --> 10:18.075
Untrod..."

10:18.743 --> 10:19.744
Good.

10:21.203 --> 10:24.123
[Roy] "...by serf...

10:24.624 --> 10:25.875
serf...

10:25.958 --> 10:27.168
or by..."

10:28.336 --> 10:29.337
[sounds out word]

10:30.796 --> 10:33.132
[sounds out word] "...slave.

10:33.215 --> 10:35.509
By... By serf or by..."

10:35.593 --> 10:36.594
[sounds out word]

10:38.471 --> 10:39.472
[sighs]

10:41.140 --> 10:42.516
-"...slave."
-Good.

10:42.600 --> 10:43.601
-"Slave."
-Good.

10:50.900 --> 10:52.068
[grunts]

10:56.155 --> 10:57.281
[horse nickers]

11:28.312 --> 11:29.688
-Ready!
-[gate opening]

11:29.772 --> 11:32.400
[Roy] Whoo! Go on, now! Get! Go on!

12:11.272 --> 12:12.398
[grunts]

12:15.276 --> 12:16.485
[panting]

12:18.154 --> 12:19.238
Haul it up!

[grunts]

12:31.709 --> 12:33.711
[water gushing]

12:41.635 --> 12:42.720
Hallelujah!

12:51.979 --> 12:53.606
You best climb up out of there.

13:10.873 --> 13:11.874
[grunts]

13:12.583 --> 13:13.709
[Truckee] Hey, Roy!

13:15.044 --> 13:16.587
I'm gonna rope me this burro!

13:20.549 --> 13:22.718
You sure you got that horse
saddled proper?

13:22.801 --> 13:23.802
Yes, sir.

13:24.720 --> 13:25.721
Watch this.

13:41.487 --> 13:42.613
Nicely done.

14:35.291 --> 14:36.750
[Callie and pupils] A.

14:36.834 --> 14:38.210
E.

14:38.294 --> 14:39.628
I.

O.

14:41.005 --> 14:42.131
U.

14:42.214 --> 14:44.717
And sometimes Y.

14:45.259 --> 14:46.260
That's right.

14:47.887 --> 14:48.929
Sorry we're late.

14:50.097 --> 14:50.931
[door closes]

14:51.015 --> 14:51.849
Jeremiah,

14:51.932 --> 14:55.978
why don't you come up and write out
the rest of the alphabet for us?

14:56.061 --> 14:57.438
I'll be back directly.

15:03.611 --> 15:04.612
Maggie?

15:11.076 --> 15:12.661
You could apologize, you know?

15:13.621 --> 15:15.372
Me? For what?

15:16.165 --> 15:17.333
You hurt me.

15:17.416 --> 15:18.459
That's rich.

15:18.542 --> 15:21.378
I don't fathom
how one person can simply forget

15:21.462 --> 15:23.881
when another person
tells her she loves her!

15:23.964 --> 15:24.924
Shh.

15:25.007 --> 15:26.592
I don't care who knows it,

15:26.675 --> 15:27.885
or what anyone thinks!

15:27.968 --> 15:29.261
I never did!

15:29.887 --> 15:32.306
But I never thought
you would be just like them.

15:33.015 --> 15:34.892
That you would see me the same as they do.

15:36.936 --> 15:38.938
How does that little Fritz bitch see you?

15:40.689 --> 15:41.690
Naked.

15:42.524 --> 15:44.485
Every square inch.

15:49.156 --> 15:50.991
[onlookers murmuring]

15:58.415 --> 15:59.750
What y'all staring at?

16:02.836 --> 16:03.837
Fuck y'all.

16:03.921 --> 16:05.130
[onlookers gasp]

16:07.132 --> 16:08.342
[murmuring]

16:36.704 --> 16:38.706
[indistinct chattering]

16:38.789 --> 16:41.667
[Major Lowell]  Well, Frank Griffin
is no longer my problem.

16:42.167 --> 16:45.838
Not since Geronimo and a few hundred
of his red-peckered Apache cousins

16:45.921 --> 16:48.507
decided to cross the border
into Arizona last month.

16:49.133 --> 16:50.759
Have you been up to Creede, Major?

16:51.802 --> 16:54.346
Had a look at what Griffin
and his cousins did?

16:54.430 --> 16:57.057
Those folks tried to take the law
into their own hands.

16:57.141 --> 17:00.269
Mm-hm, because there weren't
no law to look after them.

17:01.603 --> 17:04.440
Sooner or later, men like Griffin
find the wrong end of the rifle.

17:04.523 --> 17:05.858
It's just a matter of time.

17:06.525 --> 17:08.027
And until that happens?

17:08.986 --> 17:12.531
Well, he's the responsibility
of brave men, such as yourself.

17:16.201 --> 17:18.495
Major, he's not far.

17:19.246 --> 17:22.499
All right? I saw him but a day past
at the Purgatoire River.

17:22.708 --> 17:25.961
I bet your Crows could pick up on his
trail and have him in hand within a week.

17:26.045 --> 17:27.337
I bet we could, too.

17:28.964 --> 17:30.466
But, like I said,

17:30.549 --> 17:32.551
my orders point me elsewhere.

17:37.806 --> 17:38.974
Good hunting, Sheriff.

17:45.731 --> 17:46.899
[McNue]  Well,

17:46.982 --> 17:48.901
I can't take Griffin on my own.

17:49.610 --> 17:52.321
That's for damn sure. It'd be suicide.

17:53.489 --> 17:54.907
So go home to your children.

17:55.532 --> 17:56.950
I can't do that, either.

17:57.701 --> 17:59.411
Not without a head to show for it.

18:00.662 --> 18:02.539
This head will bring your family luck?

18:05.918 --> 18:07.044
You found the man.

18:07.127 --> 18:08.754
Is that not enough for you?

18:08.837 --> 18:10.255
Let me ask you something,

18:10.339 --> 18:12.758
Mr. Wise Old Shoshone Nuisance.

18:13.300 --> 18:17.096
You go on a buffalo hunt, how does it feel
if you come home with a rabbit?

18:17.179 --> 18:18.180
Not so good.

18:19.056 --> 18:20.099
But I come home.

18:24.770 --> 18:26.605
[dog barking]

18:32.569 --> 18:34.196
[horse whinnies]

18:46.583 --> 18:47.793
[horse snorting]

18:58.137 --> 19:00.347
[man] That's close enough.

19:02.391 --> 19:04.143
You all just turn around,

19:04.226 --> 19:06.436
go back the way you come, or else.

19:06.520 --> 19:07.604
Or else what?

19:07.688 --> 19:08.939
[man] Else we shoot ya.

19:09.439 --> 19:11.859
What the holy fuck
do you think "else" means?

19:13.902 --> 19:14.903
How many is "we"?

19:14.987 --> 19:16.697
[man] There are ten of us.

19:16.780 --> 19:18.031
[Frank] In that little shack?

34:52.340 --> 34:53.341
Eat.

34:53.424 --> 34:56.135
Gonna make you big and strong...
like me.

35:00.515 --> 35:02.350
[Roy chewing]

35:11.067 --> 35:13.069
[grunts]

35:15.905 --> 35:18.074
You've been poor your whole life,
I assume?

35:21.077 --> 35:22.161
Life's hard.

35:24.038 --> 35:26.290
It's already hard, of course,

35:26.374 --> 35:28.167
but it's even harder without luck.

35:29.544 --> 35:30.586
Bible says that?

35:32.547 --> 35:33.714
Have yourself a look.

35:34.841 --> 35:35.883
I can't read.

35:36.801 --> 35:37.885
That's all right.

35:38.678 --> 35:40.221
I can read for both of us.

35:43.933 --> 35:45.226
You've got a family now, son.

35:47.395 --> 35:48.729
These are your brothers...

35:51.774 --> 35:53.192
and I aim to be your pappy.

35:54.485 --> 35:55.945
And a good one, too.

35:58.865 --> 36:00.032
I won't mistreat you.

36:01.450 --> 36:02.451
I won't beat you.

36:03.369 --> 36:04.912
And I won't ever lie to you.

36:05.788 --> 36:06.622
Ever.

36:08.332 --> 36:09.333
Welcome home, son.

36:14.297 --> 36:16.007
[Frank]  There's different sorts of men.

36:16.090 --> 36:17.466
[thunder rumbles]

36:17.550 --> 36:19.468
Some don't have the taste for a fight.

36:20.386 --> 36:22.430
But they can talk, they can reason.

36:22.513 --> 36:23.973
That's almost as good.

36:25.141 --> 36:29.145
Then there's some men who can only talk
through their guns or their fists.

36:30.605 --> 36:32.899
There ain't no reasoning
with a man like that.

36:32.982 --> 36:34.483
A man like that comes at you,

36:34.567 --> 36:36.694
you best just be prepared to meet him.

36:37.278 --> 36:38.279
Prepared how?

36:39.488 --> 36:41.073
That's what I aim to teach you.

36:46.704 --> 36:47.955
[young Roy]  That's only a toy.

36:48.456 --> 36:50.791
-How come I don't get a real one?
-[Frank] You ain't ready.

36:52.168 --> 36:53.169
Go on, take it.

36:55.796 --> 36:57.840
Keep it in your hand all day...

36:58.674 --> 37:01.761
until it feels strange
not to have it there, until you miss it...

37:02.511 --> 37:03.888
like it's part of your arm.

37:07.475 --> 37:08.851
I want to shoot a real gun.

37:09.644 --> 37:10.853
What are you gonna shoot at?

37:11.938 --> 37:13.481
Any man who tries to shoot me.

37:13.564 --> 37:14.857
[chuckles]

37:15.816 --> 37:18.110
Let's say you get shot, anyhow. Then what?

37:19.070 --> 37:20.321
Then I guess I die.

37:20.404 --> 37:21.822
And would that be so bad?

37:23.241 --> 37:25.117
Death ain't such a big deal.

37:25.910 --> 37:28.287
It's dying that's no goddamn fun.

37:31.374 --> 37:34.001
Ain't nothing scarier
than a man with a gun.

37:37.213 --> 37:39.966
And ain't nothing more helpless
than a man without one.

37:40.967 --> 37:42.593
[thunder rumbles]

37:49.809 --> 37:51.811
[indistinct chattering]

37:58.818 --> 38:00.820
[thunder rumbles]

38:02.947 --> 38:04.573
It seems like she's doing better.

38:04.657 --> 38:06.325
Well, she's nearly rode out.

38:07.702 --> 38:08.869
But she's gentle.

38:10.204 --> 38:11.580
And she can still pull a wagon.

38:11.664 --> 38:14.166
I thought she'd be good for Sadie...

38:14.917 --> 38:16.002
and her little one.

38:19.130 --> 38:20.464
That one there is ornery.

38:21.215 --> 38:22.758
Keeps on biting the others.

38:23.884 --> 38:26.137
I thought the sheriff's sister
might like him.

38:26.595 --> 38:27.596
[chuckles]

38:29.515 --> 38:30.766
That one there is yours.

38:32.852 --> 38:33.853
Why is that?

38:35.313 --> 38:36.856
She always keeps her head up.

38:46.324 --> 38:48.034
-Thought we'd take them in tomorrow.
-Roy--

38:48.117 --> 38:49.327
Then I have to go.

38:52.038 --> 38:53.831
There's something I gotta finish.

38:55.374 --> 38:57.043
You're gonna kill Frank Griffin.

39:02.006 --> 39:03.507
When I first left Frank...

39:04.967 --> 39:07.178
I spent some time in the Fairview Hills.

39:09.388 --> 39:12.892
The more I was alone, the more I began
to have a bad time with myself.

39:14.518 --> 39:16.270
I was getting these crazy thoughts.

39:17.938 --> 39:19.690
I just could not leave Frank alone,

39:19.774 --> 39:21.400
so I started harassing him.

39:23.361 --> 39:25.446
I'd follow him, then I'd steal from him.

39:26.280 --> 39:27.323
-Why?
-I don't know.

39:27.406 --> 39:29.075
Maybe it's because I couldn't kill him.

39:29.950 --> 39:32.953
At least, not until I heard what he did
in Creede on account of me.

39:37.458 --> 39:39.585
Then it all went wrong in Doubtful Canyon.

39:41.128 --> 39:42.129
Wrong how?

39:43.631 --> 39:44.840
Neither of us died.

39:49.428 --> 39:51.389
After that, I went back to Moses

39:51.472 --> 39:53.766
to... rebury my daddy.

39:55.142 --> 39:57.019
Something I'd always swore I'd do.

39:58.020 --> 40:01.399
It ain't right, putting a man straight
into the dirt like that for all eternity,

40:01.482 --> 40:02.566
so I dug him up...

40:03.317 --> 40:04.485
moved him, and...

40:05.903 --> 40:07.446
dug him a whole new grave.

40:09.407 --> 40:11.200
After that, I was so tired I...

40:12.118 --> 40:14.829
thought I'd lie down
and bleed out right beside him.

40:18.624 --> 40:22.044
And while he was nothing but bones,
his clothes were all still there.

40:22.461 --> 40:23.754
They hadn't rotted away.

40:25.005 --> 40:26.757
I don't know how that could have happened.

40:28.134 --> 40:29.885
I recalled him wearing them clothes.

40:29.969 --> 40:32.012
Now I'm older than he was when he died,

40:32.096 --> 40:33.764
so I was recalling a younger man.

40:35.724 --> 40:37.226
I've lived longer than he did.

40:40.020 --> 40:43.315
Just then, it seemed right to me
that I put on my daddy's clothes.

40:44.358 --> 40:46.569
I don't know, I wasn't thinking straight.
I was dying.

40:46.652 --> 40:48.904
So... maybe I figured, by doing that,

40:48.988 --> 40:50.531
I'd end up wherever he is.

40:57.913 --> 41:00.833
So I laid down alongside him
and just waited to die.

41:04.211 --> 41:05.337
Waited all night.

41:08.757 --> 41:10.676
Then, at dawn, I had this vision.

41:15.139 --> 41:18.142
I realized then that hell
is gonna follow me wherever I go.

41:20.227 --> 41:23.230
I realize now that I don't ever want it
to follow me here.

41:30.488 --> 41:31.906
[Callie] You made them yourself?

41:32.907 --> 41:34.366
Nearly 50 pair.

41:35.075 --> 41:37.578
I hope the new preacher
won't frown upon it.

41:38.913 --> 41:41.499
I want to sell them... through the mail.

41:42.166 --> 41:43.542
Through the mail?

41:43.626 --> 41:46.462
I know, it sounds crazy,

41:46.545 --> 41:49.465
but if Sears and Roebuck could do it,
I could, too.

41:50.090 --> 41:51.592
But they got a catalogue.

41:52.343 --> 41:57.056
That's why I asked Mr. Grigg about
taking out an advertisement in his paper.

41:57.139 --> 41:59.099
[indistinct chattering]

42:00.226 --> 42:02.603
He said an advertisement costs $5,

42:02.686 --> 42:05.648
but that he would do it for free if I...

42:06.565 --> 42:07.566
If you what?

42:10.819 --> 42:12.446
[whispers indistinctly]

42:21.497 --> 42:23.415
You don't you worry about a thing.

42:23.499 --> 42:26.126
And don't you talk no more
to Mr. Grigg about it.

42:26.710 --> 42:28.128
I'll give you whatever you need.

42:28.212 --> 42:30.214
[thundering hooves in distance]

42:31.465 --> 42:32.675
Did you hear that?

43:14.300 --> 43:16.302
[horses whinnying]

43:25.185 --> 43:27.187
[horse whinnies]

43:30.399 --> 43:31.942
There's someone I gotta see.

43:32.860 --> 43:34.987
Who, pray tell, is that woman?

43:36.196 --> 43:38.157
Cause of all our distress.

43:39.491 --> 43:40.492
Really?

43:41.201 --> 43:42.202
That's her?

43:42.953 --> 43:44.747
That's the famous Alice Fletcher?

43:47.666 --> 43:50.794
[Grigg] And that, I'm guessing,
is her hand, Mr. Ward?

43:51.337 --> 43:52.546
[Asa] That's him.

43:52.630 --> 43:54.340
[Grigg] Not from around here, then, is he?

43:54.423 --> 43:55.716
[Asa] Not that I know of.

43:55.799 --> 43:57.718
Where all do you suppose he come from?

44:01.472 --> 44:03.557
She broke him out of jail.

44:07.936 --> 44:08.937
[chuckles]

44:27.748 --> 44:29.249
I wanted to return this to you.

44:30.668 --> 44:31.794
That was fast.

44:32.544 --> 44:33.671
He's a fast learner.

44:35.422 --> 44:36.507
I imagine so.

44:39.176 --> 44:40.386
There's something else.

44:42.221 --> 44:45.099
I was wondering
if you would like to buy my ranch.

44:45.599 --> 44:46.600
Your ranch?

44:47.434 --> 44:48.852
I'll give you a fair price.

44:50.229 --> 44:51.230
Why me?

44:51.772 --> 44:54.900
Well, I thought I'd start with
the richest person in town.

44:58.612 --> 45:00.114
There's a well, freshly dug.

45:00.906 --> 45:02.616
House and the barn are in good shape.

45:03.575 --> 45:05.285
I've got most of the land fenced.

45:05.369 --> 45:06.412
It's tempting.

45:07.788 --> 45:09.581
But I'm thinking of leaving, myself.

45:10.791 --> 45:11.917
Nothing here for me.

45:14.461 --> 45:17.131
When the mine starts back up,
all that will change, won't it?

45:17.714 --> 45:19.258
I don't want to go back to that.

45:20.175 --> 45:21.009
No.

45:22.678 --> 45:24.179
No, I don't see as you would.

45:26.557 --> 45:27.683
Thanks for the book.

45:30.894 --> 45:32.688
You've proved it up so nice.

45:34.815 --> 45:36.400
Be a shame for you to leave.

45:47.077 --> 45:48.078
[door closes]

45:52.291 --> 45:54.001
You steal that from me?

45:54.084 --> 45:54.960
Watch.

45:55.043 --> 45:55.878
[clatters]

45:56.670 --> 45:57.671
Well done.

46:00.716 --> 46:01.842
When you gonna teach me?

46:02.551 --> 46:04.052
More than likely never.

46:04.136 --> 46:05.220
How come?

46:05.304 --> 46:07.181
You want to teach me everything else.

46:07.264 --> 46:09.433
Well, I ain't teaching you
how to be no show-off.

46:09.516 --> 46:11.185
I don't think you even know how to do it.

46:12.144 --> 46:14.062
Well, you're right, I don't. I just...

46:14.730 --> 46:17.983
I just know how to get it clear of my
holster without shooting my damn foot off.

46:18.066 --> 46:19.401
The rest is just silly nonsense.

46:19.485 --> 46:20.611
And know what else?

46:20.694 --> 46:22.821
I'm done talking with you about guns.

46:25.073 --> 46:26.074
[Logan] Don't shoot!

46:27.367 --> 46:28.410
[chuckles] Don't shoot.

46:30.579 --> 46:31.580
We meet again.

46:34.917 --> 46:36.460
I always get a bad feeling...

46:37.336 --> 46:39.963
when I keep running into
a man I don't know.

46:41.298 --> 46:42.382
Makes me wonder.

46:44.092 --> 46:45.969
Tell me, friend,
should I wonder about you?

46:47.763 --> 46:48.764
No.

46:50.891 --> 46:52.935
There's plenty of others
more worrisome than me.

46:54.561 --> 46:56.647
You understand
I'm the new law around here?

46:56.730 --> 46:58.232
What happened to the old law?

46:58.315 --> 46:59.816
Your guess is as good as mine.

47:02.861 --> 47:04.696
Well, sir, I ain't your problem.

47:05.822 --> 47:06.907
I'll be leaving real soon.

47:07.866 --> 47:08.700
Town?

47:08.784 --> 47:09.910
Territory.

47:14.498 --> 47:15.541
Boy.

47:17.584 --> 47:18.669
You remember me?

47:21.463 --> 47:22.464
[chuckles]

47:23.006 --> 47:24.132
Look at him.

47:24.633 --> 47:27.678
You can just tell he'd like
to knock the turkey out of me.

47:27.761 --> 47:28.971
[laughs]

47:29.471 --> 47:32.641
How about I get down off this animal
and give you one free shot?

47:33.141 --> 47:34.601
How about I pull you off?

47:34.685 --> 47:36.478
[chuckles]

47:38.063 --> 47:39.356
We'll be on our way, sir.

47:40.107 --> 47:41.108
Yeah, you will.

47:48.156 --> 47:49.157
You feel better?

47:49.866 --> 47:50.701
I do.

47:51.410 --> 47:53.704
-And nobody got shot.
-Nope.

47:54.788 --> 47:56.498
[Truckee] I sure do hate that man.

47:56.707 --> 47:58.584
Someday, I'll get him back.

47:59.293 --> 48:00.377
I don't doubt it.

48:01.211 --> 48:03.630
But you just keep in mind,

48:03.714 --> 48:05.215
if a person ain't careful...

48:06.091 --> 48:08.218
they can make a profession out of revenge.

48:24.359 --> 48:26.028
Shot the head off a snake.
