00:02.402 --> 00:05.496
See, now this is called
the-severed-finger-in-a-box trick.

00:05.672 --> 00:10.268
See, you just slide your finger up
in the bottom and then voilà.

00:12.345 --> 00:13.471
Cool.

00:13.646 --> 00:17.047
- Good morning, everyone.
- Hey, what's up, C?

00:17.217 --> 00:19.481
Watch and learn.

00:23.156 --> 00:25.147
Hey, Carlton, what's up, man?

00:25.325 --> 00:28.624
You know, I was out
so I picked a little something up for you.

00:28.795 --> 00:31.662
Will, how sweet.

00:37.170 --> 00:38.831
Ha, ha, ha.

00:39.239 --> 00:40.706
Ow!

00:45.912 --> 00:48.039
Let's get Geoffrey.

00:48.648 --> 00:50.275
I don't know. I'll give it a try...

00:50.450 --> 00:54.284
...but I've been trying to get G for years,
he don't fall for nothing.

00:54.921 --> 00:59.381
Hey, G. You know, man, I was out
and I was thinking about you, you know...

00:59.559 --> 01:01.959
...so I picked a little something up
for you.

01:03.000 --> 01:09.074

01:14.107 --> 01:15.699
I'm looking for Geoffrey.

01:16.643 --> 01:19.976
- I'm Geoffrey.
- Then you must be my father.

01:27.120 --> 01:29.680
Well, he fell for that.

02:50.236 --> 02:52.170
Let's have it, what's your name, boy?

02:52.338 --> 02:53.600
Where are you from?

02:53.773 --> 02:57.209
And where'd you get
that outstanding cashmere jacket?

02:59.345 --> 03:02.906
I know this is quite a shock.
I'm sorry for startling you, Father.

03:03.082 --> 03:05.676
Let's put a pin in this father thing
for the time being.

03:06.519 --> 03:09.579
I'm sure you're a nice enough lad,
but I have no son.

03:09.756 --> 03:12.884
So let's see, the YMCA is downtown.
Open for business.

03:13.059 --> 03:16.756
There's a church next door. If you sit
through a sermon you can eat for free.

03:16.930 --> 03:18.295
Bye-bye. Ta-ta. Cheerio.

03:19.532 --> 03:21.159
Wait, I can prove it.

03:21.334 --> 03:23.131
You're allergic to peanuts.

03:23.303 --> 03:24.964
Many are.

03:25.138 --> 03:27.629
Your middle name is Barbara.

03:32.078 --> 03:34.171
Lucky guess.

03:34.747 --> 03:36.647
Barbara?

03:41.454 --> 03:43.945
It's a family name.

03:44.123 --> 03:46.717
Okay. You have a tattoo
of the Queen Mum on your...

03:46.893 --> 03:49.259
Oh, my God.

03:49.429 --> 03:52.489
How can Geoffrey be your dad
if he was never married?

03:53.666 --> 03:56.897
Okay, I'll talk to him.

03:57.403 --> 04:02.067
Well, you see, Nicky, sometimes
the stork's arms get real tired, right?

04:02.242 --> 04:05.109
He pretty much leave the baby
wherever he at.

04:05.478 --> 04:06.740
- Will.
All right.

04:06.913 --> 04:09.711
Get. Thank you.

04:09.983 --> 04:15.888
Well, Nicky, sometimes the stork's map
gets all scrunched up.

04:16.456 --> 04:19.584
Sorry, I should explain.
My name is Frederick Vickers.

04:19.759 --> 04:21.226
Penelope's your mother?

04:22.428 --> 04:25.090
- So it's true?
- Well, we were married.

04:25.265 --> 04:27.062
Briefly.

04:27.500 --> 04:29.434
But we had no children.

04:29.602 --> 04:33.595
That's right, G. Stick to your story, man.
At least till the blood test come out, man.

04:33.773 --> 04:36.571
- Don't tell him nothing.
- Will. Will.

04:36.743 --> 04:40.873
By the time Mom knew she was pregnant,
you'd already left for America.

04:41.047 --> 04:44.915
But everything turned out fine.
We live in a small flat in Kensington.

04:45.084 --> 04:48.212
I enjoy riding, cricket
and books about the sea.

04:48.388 --> 04:52.017
Yo, he got the same interests
as Miss July.

04:54.427 --> 04:57.692
Well, it was nice meeting you,
but I should be going.

04:57.864 --> 05:01.322
- I need to check into a motel for the night.
- Motel? Nonsense.

05:01.501 --> 05:06.234
I insist you stay here.
My house is your house.

05:08.474 --> 05:13.036
That is, my room
and half a shelf in the refrigerator.

05:13.212 --> 05:14.736
Yeah, at least stay for dinner.

05:14.914 --> 05:16.438
Of course he can stay, Geoffrey.

05:16.616 --> 05:19.141
In the pool house with us. It'll be fun.

05:19.319 --> 05:23.585
We'll stay up late, play Clue and
try on each other's jackets. Heh, heh, heh.

05:24.557 --> 05:27.287
I think it sounds like a ripping good time.

05:27.460 --> 05:30.987
Say, do you have any Tom Jones records?

05:33.733 --> 05:35.860
Do I?

05:49.549 --> 05:53.610
Hilary, if I didn't know any better
I'd say you were reading.

05:54.587 --> 05:57.078
I am. This is fascinating.

05:57.256 --> 05:59.850
- What's it about?
- Me.

06:01.160 --> 06:04.527
Frederick's arrival's made me wanna
look into my own past, you know?

06:04.697 --> 06:06.927
Look at all of this. It's all me.

06:07.100 --> 06:10.001
I have enough stuff here to write a book.

06:10.169 --> 06:15.163
- Kind of a riches-to-riches story, huh?
- Ha, ha, ha. Ugh...

06:16.175 --> 06:19.042
Oh, look at this picture
from my kindergarten class.

06:19.212 --> 06:21.578
Oh, I was darling, wasn't I?

06:21.748 --> 06:24.216
Aw, you sure were. Heh, heh, heh.

06:24.384 --> 06:28.320
Who is this poor little homely child
next to me?

06:28.488 --> 06:31.616
Uh, sweetheart, that was you.

06:33.593 --> 06:34.753
What? You always said...

06:34.927 --> 06:38.658
The first time you looked at these,
you cried so hard that we lied to you.

06:38.831 --> 06:41.265
We said you were the cute little girl
next to you.

06:41.434 --> 06:43.527
But eventually,
your teeth straightened out...

06:43.703 --> 06:46.900
...and you grew into your nose,
just like we said.

06:49.175 --> 06:52.872
You mean, you lied to me?
You told me I was pretty when I wasn't?

06:53.045 --> 06:56.105
- Well...
- Thank you. You really do love me.

07:02.889 --> 07:05.517
- Geoffrey, are you all right?
- Never better, sir.

07:05.691 --> 07:08.660
- What is all this stuff?
- Oh, they're for Frederick.

07:08.828 --> 07:10.819
Transformers. They're on special.

07:10.997 --> 07:13.761
A mitt. A football. A tool set.

07:13.933 --> 07:16.595
And, just in case,
a book on interior design.

07:17.503 --> 07:20.939
Geoffrey, I hate to break this to you,
but you're about 10 years too late.

07:21.107 --> 07:23.667
Boys Frederick's age don't play with toys.

07:24.210 --> 07:26.007
Ooh!

07:27.246 --> 07:31.945
Transformers. I've been looking
for Razorbeast since, like, October.

07:34.320 --> 07:37.118
I must admit, sir, I'm at a loss.

07:37.290 --> 07:40.919
You've raised four children.
Well, five if you include...

07:43.729 --> 07:47.426
Bow before Razorbeast
or I will crush you.

07:50.570 --> 07:53.767
I just don't know what to do first.

07:53.940 --> 07:59.105
Geoffrey, I have known you for years.
You will be a great father.

07:59.278 --> 08:03.112
But, sir, I don't know anything about him.
I don't know what his interests are.

08:03.282 --> 08:06.740
I don't even know whether
he would prefer a loose or a firm pleat.

08:07.887 --> 08:11.254
Geoffrey, you will have plenty of time
to find everything out.

08:11.424 --> 08:13.892
Had I known I was a father,
I would've known all this.

08:14.060 --> 08:17.689
- I would have been there.
- I know you would have.

08:18.331 --> 08:19.696
I'm so nervous.

08:21.234 --> 08:23.134
I just don't want to let him down.

08:23.302 --> 08:26.465
Geoffrey, you will do fine.

08:26.639 --> 08:28.300
Just be yourself.

08:28.474 --> 08:30.374
Does that mean
I don't have to play catch?

08:30.543 --> 08:31.840
- That's right.
- Oh, good.

08:32.010 --> 08:34.741
Then he doesn't have to know
his dad throws like a girl.

08:41.254 --> 08:45.281
Since Frederick is a guest of honor tonight
I insist that you join us for dinner.

08:45.458 --> 08:47.688
- Oh, very kind of you, sir.
Yeah, yeah.

08:47.860 --> 08:51.091
Sit on down. Sit on down.

08:52.031 --> 08:53.931
Okay.

09:00.540 --> 09:02.770
Perhaps I should join you after dinner.

09:02.942 --> 09:04.204
Great.

09:04.844 --> 09:07.244
That way we can eat.
That would be better.

09:07.413 --> 09:09.779
There you go.
Ha, ha, ha.

09:10.616 --> 09:15.178
Have you noticed how Father holds that
dish perfectly balanced in his right hand...

09:15.354 --> 09:20.291
...with his fingers just barely steadying it?
Superb, Father.

09:21.494 --> 09:24.588
England must be really boring.

09:25.197 --> 09:27.427
I think it's so great
you're not embarrassed...

09:27.600 --> 09:30.398
...that your father has to do this stuff
in people's lives...

09:30.570 --> 09:34.404
...that's too disgusting for them
to do themselves. No offense, Geoffrey.

09:35.207 --> 09:39.473
None taken, Miss Hilary.
I always consider the source.

09:40.079 --> 09:42.013
How sweet. Heh.

09:42.815 --> 09:46.774
You know, Father, being in service
is something I've always dreamed of.

09:46.953 --> 09:49.251
- May I?
- Certainly, son.

09:49.422 --> 09:52.516
"Son." I do like the sound of that.

09:52.692 --> 09:55.627
I know I can't match your expertise.

09:55.795 --> 09:59.993
I owe it all to my training
at the Cambridge Academy of Butlering.

10:00.166 --> 10:05.695
Ah, to be a CAB grad and wear
the school colors, black and white.

10:05.871 --> 10:08.863
Perhaps one day we can work together.

10:09.041 --> 10:11.805
No. CAB is very expensive.

10:12.211 --> 10:15.078
No, it's a dream that shall never be.

10:15.247 --> 10:17.238
I wanna be a butler too.

10:17.783 --> 10:19.546
No, you don't.

10:23.289 --> 10:24.950
Thanks for taking me with you.

10:25.124 --> 10:28.184
You had gorgeous women
literally climbing all over you today.

10:28.361 --> 10:30.522
You're even better than Will.
How'd you do it?

10:30.696 --> 10:33.927
Well, I'm sure the ladies
were merely charmed by my accent.

10:34.100 --> 10:37.194
Man, you gotta teach me
how to talk that English stuff.

10:37.370 --> 10:41.033
No problem, Jazz.
I hope I didn't cramp your style today, Will.

10:42.408 --> 10:47.243
Who me? Man, I got plenty of honeys
to choose from. Shoot.

10:47.813 --> 10:51.408
You know,
in England we call pool "snooker."

10:51.584 --> 10:53.518
Snooker. Ha, ha, ha.

10:53.686 --> 10:56.621
Man, the way this guy talk cracks me up.

10:56.822 --> 10:58.915
What y'all people call this?

10:59.992 --> 11:01.016
A clock.

11:01.661 --> 11:03.720
"A clock." Heh, heh, heh.

11:04.463 --> 11:06.431
I gotta remember that.

11:06.599 --> 11:10.091
Hey, yo, pizza. Sixteen bucks without tip.

11:10.269 --> 11:11.702
All right.

11:12.204 --> 11:14.331
- Ah, man, I don't have no money.
- Ditto.

11:14.507 --> 11:17.601
Unfortunately,
I'm down to my last penny.

11:21.347 --> 11:23.838
All right. Excuse me one second, bro.

11:24.016 --> 11:26.814
I gotta go check my super secret stash.

11:26.986 --> 11:29.819
- All right, come on. Assume the position.
- Oh, come on, Will.

11:29.989 --> 11:31.581
You know the routine.

11:34.293 --> 11:37.660
- You ain't special. Fall in line, Brit boy.
- Oh, sorry.

11:41.400 --> 11:43.027
<i>Gotta go find my money</i>

11:55.414 --> 11:57.678
All right, y'all can look now.

11:58.818 --> 12:02.219
There you go,
16 bucks without tip. Peace.

12:05.191 --> 12:09.560
Mm-mm-mm. Two jumbos with
extra jalapeños and pineapples.

12:09.729 --> 12:12.289
- Come on. We got to rock this by the pool.
Cool.

12:12.465 --> 12:16.367
I mean, that sounds like ripping fun.
Ha, ha, ha.

12:16.836 --> 12:21.000
I shall join you fellows out there shortly.
I have to avail myself of the bathroom.

12:21.173 --> 12:23.073
"The bathroom."

12:23.242 --> 12:26.234
Damn, I gotta learn
how to speak that language.

12:26.412 --> 12:28.676
We'll be out by the pool, man.

12:43.729 --> 12:45.458
Yo, Freddy Boom-Boom, man, we about...

12:45.631 --> 12:48.429
Oh, hello,
I was just looking for your bathroom.

12:48.601 --> 12:51.001
- What you got there, man?
- Pardon me?

13:02.515 --> 13:04.540
Give me my money, man.

13:05.918 --> 13:07.749
I don't know what you're talking about.

13:07.920 --> 13:11.151
Hey, you took my money out
from under that plant. Give it here.

13:11.323 --> 13:15.089
I have no idea what you're referring to.

13:15.961 --> 13:19.362
Let me see if we can jog your memory
up in here.

13:21.600 --> 13:25.195
Fine. What were you going to do?
Beat me up?

13:25.371 --> 13:28.534
Oh, no. I'm about to beat you down.

13:28.707 --> 13:30.766
Let's go, boy. Come on. Come on.

13:30.943 --> 13:32.570
Ah! Ugh!

13:43.355 --> 13:46.347
Boy, let me tell you.
You are so lucky that you Geoffrey's son.

13:46.525 --> 13:49.050
Ah. I'm glad it finally comes in handy
for something.

13:49.695 --> 13:53.187
- Don't be talking about your pop like that.
- My father of two days?

13:53.365 --> 13:56.596
- Your servant?
- I thought you wanted to be just like him.

13:56.769 --> 13:59.829
Oh, please.
Me be a butler, serving the likes of you?

14:01.440 --> 14:03.533
Now you made it personal.

14:08.581 --> 14:10.776
Go ahead, hit me.

14:11.517 --> 14:14.953
No. That's too easy.

14:15.120 --> 14:17.554
I'm gonna tell your father
what kind of son he has.

14:17.723 --> 14:20.089
Go ahead, break his heart.

14:27.967 --> 14:30.868
- Y'all seen Frederick?
- Yeah. In the kitchen with Geoffrey.

14:31.303 --> 14:33.237
Hil, I need to talk to you for a second.

14:33.405 --> 14:38.001
Now, look, what if you knew something
that you really needed to tell somebody...

14:38.177 --> 14:40.577
...but you knew if you told them
it would hurt them?

14:40.746 --> 14:42.771
Maybe even break their heart.

14:42.948 --> 14:45.280
Oh, no. I haven't grown into my nose.

14:48.254 --> 14:50.779
Teaspoon. Soupspoon.

14:50.956 --> 14:53.322
Salad fork. Dinner fork.

14:55.194 --> 14:58.095
Frederick, my man. Pip-pip.

15:00.666 --> 15:03.134
You look like an ass.

15:04.803 --> 15:09.206
I'll have you know this is a bona fide
British bowler and bumbershoot.

15:09.375 --> 15:13.277
I don't know which is which,
but I paid good money for the set.

15:14.213 --> 15:16.545
I cannot believe you sweating this fool.

15:16.715 --> 15:19.275
I saw him stealing money
out from under my secret plant.

15:19.952 --> 15:24.048
Will, just for my edification,
what plant would that be now?

15:24.223 --> 15:25.952
Carlton, did you hear what I said?

15:26.125 --> 15:29.583
You just can't get over the fact
that there's a couple new guns in town.

15:29.762 --> 15:32.060
I say, old bloke, what do you say...

15:32.231 --> 15:34.165
...we squire ourselves
down to the local pub...

15:34.333 --> 15:37.131
...and chat up some birds?
- What?

15:37.603 --> 15:40.094
Wanna get a drink after dinner?

15:43.442 --> 15:47.276
By Jove, that was a jolly good meal.

15:48.280 --> 15:50.271
- You see this fork?
Yeah.

15:50.449 --> 15:54.044
If you don't stop talking like that
it's gonna be in your leg.

15:55.888 --> 16:01.451
Frederick, finding out that you are my son
has been one of the greatest joys of my life.

16:01.827 --> 16:06.662
And knowing that you wish to follow in my
footsteps has made me a very happy man.

16:06.832 --> 16:10.131
- So if you wish to go to the Academy...
- Oh, Father, more than anything.

16:10.302 --> 16:13.829
Perhaps this check for your tuition
will show you how I feel.

16:14.006 --> 16:17.373
Oh.
Oh! Whoa!

16:17.910 --> 16:21.368
You're going to make
a blooming good butler.

16:21.547 --> 16:22.946
Ow!

16:25.617 --> 16:28.245
Pip-pip. Cheerio.

16:30.055 --> 16:31.647
Carlton, where is he? Where is he?

16:31.824 --> 16:34.987
Oh, who scraped
the icing off your cupcake?

16:35.160 --> 16:37.287
Carlton,
I've been going over this in my mind.

16:37.463 --> 16:41.263
G has got to know about his son.
Where is that little thief?

16:41.433 --> 16:43.993
Oh, Will, will you stop
with these crazy allegations?

16:44.169 --> 16:46.933
First he tried to rob me.
Now he's trying to stick it to G.

16:47.106 --> 16:49.574
- Where is he?
- Will, the money is for his education.

16:49.742 --> 16:53.109
He don't wanna go to no butler school.
I'm not asking again, where is he?

16:53.278 --> 16:56.611
Will, cool your jets, mister.
You're all over the map.

16:56.782 --> 16:59.046
Carlton, where is he? Where is he?

16:59.218 --> 17:03.552
I think he went
to go get his suitcase repaired.

17:04.022 --> 17:06.924
- What are you talking about?
- He's gone and so is his suitcase.

17:07.092 --> 17:09.321
That's the only logical explanation.

17:12.097 --> 17:15.089
Carlton, man, he left.
Come on, we gotta stop him.

17:15.267 --> 17:19.601
Fine, but you're only gonna be making
a fool of yourself. Frederick is trustworthy.

17:19.771 --> 17:22.297
Hey, my bowler's gone.

17:22.674 --> 17:25.142
That limey thief.

17:34.820 --> 17:38.187
- His flight leaves in about five minutes.
- Right behind you.

17:39.558 --> 17:42.322
- Hold on there, sport.
- Carlton, I gotta go to the gate, man.

17:42.494 --> 17:43.518
Go back through.

17:49.101 --> 17:52.264
- Empty your pockets.
- I don't have anything in my pockets.

17:52.671 --> 17:54.571
I think you're gonna have
to come with me.

17:54.740 --> 17:56.708
Hey!

17:59.578 --> 18:04.641
Last call for boarding
Air Britain Flight 1420 to London.

18:10.222 --> 18:13.521
What's up, man? What, no goodbye?
No, "Let's keep in touch"?

18:13.692 --> 18:16.820
I thought you were such a gentleman.
Give me that check right now.

18:16.995 --> 18:18.087
It's not yours.

18:18.263 --> 18:21.994
This has nothing to do with you, Will.
This is between me and my father.

18:23.402 --> 18:27.361
What, were you just sitting around one day
sipping tea and crumpets and just decided:

18:27.539 --> 18:30.269
"Hey, I'm gonna fly
halfway around the Earth...

18:30.442 --> 18:33.104
...to go steal from the father
that I don't even know"?

18:33.278 --> 18:36.247
I don't call it stealing.
I call it getting what's owed to me.

18:36.415 --> 18:38.610
Now, if you'll excuse me,
my plane is boarding.

18:40.252 --> 18:41.549
You know what's a real pity?

18:41.720 --> 18:44.883
You don't even know the kind of man
that you're walking away from.

18:45.057 --> 18:47.753
Keep that money,
you're losing something way more valuable.

18:47.926 --> 18:50.326
- Is that right?
- Yeah, that is right.

18:50.496 --> 18:54.091
Geoffrey's the kind of guy
that when you down...

18:57.236 --> 18:59.727
Yeah, he'll pretty much kick you.

18:59.938 --> 19:03.704
No, no, I'm saying though, it's like you
come home late, you know, to the crib...

19:03.876 --> 19:06.276
...you don't want your parents to know,
Geoffrey...

19:06.445 --> 19:08.379
...will dime you out.

19:09.047 --> 19:11.515
This is the man you're defending.

19:11.683 --> 19:14.447
Yes. He's also the man
whose eyes welled up with pride...

19:14.620 --> 19:16.349
...when you walked through that door.

19:16.522 --> 19:20.390
He's also the man that can't stop bragging
about you to all his butler friends.

19:20.559 --> 19:25.155
The man that didn't hesitate to empty out
his life savings for his so-called son.

19:27.032 --> 19:30.263
But you know what? You go ahead.
You got a flight to catch.

19:36.608 --> 19:40.066
I guess this thing must be broken.
You can go.

19:40.245 --> 19:42.736
Oh, don't stop now.

19:52.524 --> 19:56.517
- What's up, G?
- Oh, Master William. I'm glad you're here.

19:56.695 --> 20:01.394
What kind of bike do you think
Frederick would like? Mountain or racing?

20:02.334 --> 20:03.596
We gotta talk, G.

20:04.069 --> 20:06.663
You think I'm spoiling him, don't you?

20:06.838 --> 20:09.432
I think that ship has sailed.

20:09.608 --> 20:13.601
Look, G,
what I'm about to say is gonna hurt you.

20:13.779 --> 20:16.714
It's gonna hurt you bad,
but I'm gonna just cut to the chase.

20:16.882 --> 20:19.612
Because I'm about
to practically annihilate you.

20:20.118 --> 20:22.109
All right? But I'm gonna get right to it.

20:22.287 --> 20:25.051
All right?
Because this is gonna sting real, real bad.

20:25.224 --> 20:28.193
- I ain't doing no pussy-footing around...
- Master William...

20:28.360 --> 20:30.260
...hurt me already.

20:30.729 --> 20:34.221
Frederick is not what he appears to be.
He stole from me. He stole from you.

20:34.399 --> 20:37.891
He's on a plane back to England
with no intention of going to butler school.

20:38.070 --> 20:39.799
And you're never gonna see him again.

20:40.205 --> 20:41.763
Hello, Frederick.

20:42.674 --> 20:44.767
Three out of four ain't bad.

20:45.544 --> 20:46.636
What's going on?

20:47.012 --> 20:50.038
I came here to give you this.

20:51.216 --> 20:53.343
I don't understand.

20:54.486 --> 20:56.818
Will, I thought
you said we was going out tonight?

20:56.989 --> 20:58.513
Here I come, y'all.

21:00.792 --> 21:02.487
Well, Frederick?

21:03.762 --> 21:05.821
I came here...

21:05.998 --> 21:09.058
...to scam money
from the father I never knew.

21:09.635 --> 21:14.436
But somewhere along the way
I realized I can't do this.

21:15.407 --> 21:18.968
I suppose I'm not the son
you thought I was.

21:19.278 --> 21:21.974
I had no expectations.

21:22.214 --> 21:24.739
Until yesterday,
I didn't even know I had a son.

21:24.916 --> 21:28.443
But you knew you had a father
whom you'd never met.

21:28.620 --> 21:29.712
Frederick...

21:30.322 --> 21:33.018
...what you did was not out of malice
towards me...

21:33.191 --> 21:35.682
...it was out of confusion and anger.

21:36.962 --> 21:39.760
So you forgive me?

21:40.365 --> 21:42.959
That is what fathers do.
