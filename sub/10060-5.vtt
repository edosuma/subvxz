HANNAH: Great, 'cause
I'm hiding from Fran.

00:20.291 --> 00:21.875
MARNIE: Work it out.
He's a really good guy.

00:22.125 --> 00:23.750
He's a seemingly good guy.

00:23.750 --> 00:26.250
Hannah, it's more complex
than you understand.

00:26.250 --> 00:27.917
HANNAH: Maybe it's not
more complex, okay?

00:27.917 --> 00:29.041
Because mom wants a devorece.

00:29.834 --> 00:32.083
Get on a plane. I'll even
pick you up at the airport.

00:32.083 --> 00:34.041
I don't want to go back to
America.

00:34.250 --> 00:35.875
Then, why don't you stay?

00:36.166 --> 00:38.083
-Hot date tonight?
-ELIJAH: He's quite famous.

HANNAH: You're acting so weird.
Somthing's going on.

00:43.125 --> 00:44.125
I'm fine.

00:44.583 --> 00:46.041
Okay, then maybe we're just
growing in different directions.

00:47.208 --> 00:48.458
Maybe you don't want to be
friends anymore.

00:49.041 --> 00:49.708
Maybe.

00:50.708 --> 00:51.333
Jessa!

00:51.917 --> 00:53.750
I've wanted this for
a really long time.

Mom, no.

01:19.041 --> 01:21.458
I don't care
what they're calling it,
because I need it.

01:21.458 --> 01:23.708
I have some
big choices to make.

01:23.708 --> 01:26.166
I mean, how big could they be?
You already decided
to get a divorce.

01:26.166 --> 01:28.834
I didn't decide
to get divorced.

01:28.834 --> 01:32.500
Then what did you mean
by, "Tell Dad I want
a fucking divorce"?

01:32.500 --> 01:36.417
I'm taking some time
and considering,
as I turn 60,

01:36.417 --> 01:38.834
whether I can stand
to spend the rest
of my life

01:38.834 --> 01:40.500
sexless and alone.

01:40.500 --> 01:43.000
You don't
have to be sexless
and alone, Mom.

01:43.000 --> 01:45.041
Plus, isn't gay husband
kind of the same

01:45.041 --> 01:47.083
as no husband,
sexually speaking?

01:47.083 --> 01:49.500
No, sex has never
been our problem.

01:49.500 --> 01:53.000
It's actually
even been better lately.

01:53.000 --> 01:54.625
Less pressure.

01:55.708 --> 01:57.834
- Mm-mm-mm.
- Mom!

02:26.208 --> 02:29.125
You perform your job
with such perfect charm.

02:29.125 --> 02:31.959
It's very sweet of you
to spend your lunch hour
with me.

02:31.959 --> 02:35.542
Shoshani, Buriki is hiding
in windowsill again.

02:35.542 --> 02:37.041
I'll let you
do your job.

02:39.333 --> 02:41.208
Please, Shoshani.

02:45.125 --> 02:47.291
Oh, your friend
is looking for you.

02:50.417 --> 02:52.917
( meowing, purring )

02:52.917 --> 02:55.000
Abigail.

02:55.000 --> 02:59.375
Uh...
Ab-- Abigail, hi.

02:59.375 --> 03:02.542
Shoshanna, hello.

03:02.542 --> 03:06.041
Um, what--
what are you--
are you here for work?

03:06.041 --> 03:08.625
It's all right.
You don't have to be
kind to me.

03:08.625 --> 03:11.125
I know I took
a spiked dildo

03:11.125 --> 03:14.417
and I frickin' rammed it
right into your heart hole.

03:14.417 --> 03:16.125
I'm really sorry.

03:16.125 --> 03:18.708
Seriously,
Abigail, I'm fine.

03:18.708 --> 03:22.000
Honestly, Shoshanna,
it's hard for me to see
you like this,

03:22.000 --> 03:25.083
working in what
is clearly a sex hut.

03:25.083 --> 03:27.542
Oh, no,
it's actually
just a cat café.

03:27.542 --> 03:30.166
I know what cat is.

03:30.166 --> 03:32.125
I've had a boyfriend.

03:32.125 --> 03:33.667
It's gonna be okay.

03:33.667 --> 03:36.333
Really, Abigail,
I love it here.

03:36.333 --> 03:37.500
This place
is incredible.

03:37.500 --> 03:38.792
I'm learning
about a new culture,

03:38.792 --> 03:40.542
and in turn
I'm learning
about myself,

03:40.542 --> 03:43.125
and I'm also in
a real serious phase

03:43.125 --> 03:46.375
of romantic exploration
with Yoshi, so...

03:46.375 --> 03:48.208
Yoshi from work?

03:48.208 --> 03:49.875
Okay, that is very cool

03:49.875 --> 03:54.375
because he looks like
an Asiatic One Direction
member.

03:54.375 --> 03:56.125
Well, I mean, he isn't
Yoshi from work anymore.

03:56.125 --> 03:58.959
Now he's just Yoshi
from my heart.

03:58.959 --> 04:01.625
God, I'm really happy
for you, honestly.

04:01.625 --> 04:05.792
I'm surprised.
I'm shocked, even,
that you like it here.

04:05.792 --> 04:08.166
I gotta tell ya,
I have a couple days,

04:08.166 --> 04:11.458
and I was planning
to just steadily sit
in the McDonald's

04:11.458 --> 04:13.667
until I felt safe again.

04:13.667 --> 04:16.416
Okay, you know what?
I have tomorrow off.

04:16.416 --> 04:21.000
Let me take you around.
I'm going to make you
love Japan.

04:30.875 --> 04:32.792
Wow.

04:32.792 --> 04:34.000
Yeah.

04:34.000 --> 04:35.834
Yeah, all right.

04:37.417 --> 04:39.959
A lot
of Eileen Fisher here.

04:39.959 --> 04:42.083
- Hannah.
- What?

04:42.083 --> 04:45.000
They're sassy separates.
I just can't afford them.

04:45.000 --> 04:46.834
I'll go check us in.

04:47.875 --> 04:49.708
Hello.

04:49.708 --> 04:51.375
Man:
...and green
and really--

04:51.375 --> 04:53.375
it's just a wonderful
place to grow up.

04:53.375 --> 04:55.875
( chattering quietly )

04:55.875 --> 04:58.125
Okay,
well, good peace
to you both.

04:58.125 --> 04:59.708
- Yes. Oh, um...
- Thank you.

04:59.708 --> 05:01.333
Okay, no phones,
please.

05:01.333 --> 05:04.041
Oh, I wasn't making a call.
I was just gonna send an e-mail.

05:04.041 --> 05:05.500
Okay.

05:05.500 --> 05:07.792
It's just that
we mentioned this
in the e-mails.

05:07.792 --> 05:10.333
In the pamphlet,
in the itinerary.

05:10.333 --> 05:13.000
- Mm-hmm.
- Dhanimahila is about
dropping our walls

05:13.000 --> 05:16.375
and that starts
with dropping our screens.

05:16.375 --> 05:18.875
Well, that's great
because I'm not even
getting any service anyway.

05:18.875 --> 05:20.542
Well, maybe
that's a signal

05:20.542 --> 05:23.750
that the person you need
to connect with is yourself.

05:23.750 --> 05:26.875
Well, if you're telling me
to masturbate, I already did.

05:26.875 --> 05:28.375
( laughs )

05:31.291 --> 05:34.250
I'm glad you're
having fun already.

05:34.250 --> 05:36.417
( quiet chatter )

05:38.291 --> 05:40.250
Wow.

05:43.083 --> 05:45.375
Hi, I'm Loreen.

05:45.375 --> 05:46.750
This is my daughter
Hannah.

05:46.750 --> 05:49.542
Hi, Hannah.
I'm Cathy with a C

05:49.542 --> 05:51.125
and that's Kathy
with a K,

05:51.125 --> 05:52.458
and this is Barb.

05:52.458 --> 05:54.291
With a C or a K?

05:54.291 --> 05:56.291
With a B.

05:56.291 --> 06:00.708
Hi, I'm Kourtney,
but everyone calls me Koko.

06:00.708 --> 06:02.250
Are you
the yoga teacher?

06:02.250 --> 06:04.917
Oh, my God, no.
I wish.

06:04.917 --> 06:07.000
Though I do teach spin
in Westport.

06:07.000 --> 06:08.583
And also yoga.

06:08.583 --> 06:10.458
The itinerary said
that the orientation

06:10.458 --> 06:12.333
was supposed to start
like 10 minutes ago.

06:12.333 --> 06:14.792
Oh, do you think maybe
we should be someplace else?

06:14.792 --> 06:18.166
Who here
is waiting for someone

06:18.166 --> 06:20.333
to tell them what to do?

06:20.333 --> 06:22.125
You just said that.

06:22.125 --> 06:25.917
Because orientation
was supposed to start
10 minutes ago...

06:25.917 --> 06:27.250
Mm-hmm.

06:27.250 --> 06:30.834
...and none of you
said anything.

06:30.834 --> 06:32.250
Well, we were late.

06:32.250 --> 06:35.959
Yes, you were, and now
you're interrupting.

06:35.959 --> 06:41.291
The rest of you
just stood here waiting.

06:41.291 --> 06:44.375
Fearful, polite,

06:44.375 --> 06:48.041
asking for permission.

06:48.041 --> 06:49.917
That's your problem.

06:52.250 --> 06:55.291
Loreen:
Do you want to call Fran?
I can give you some privacy.

06:55.291 --> 06:57.458
Ugh, no.

06:57.458 --> 06:59.458
I thought
you liked him.

06:59.458 --> 07:01.542
I do like him.
He's so nice.

07:01.542 --> 07:03.041
I feel like
if we were in Hollywood,

07:03.041 --> 07:04.875
people would be like,
"Tom Hanks is such a dick.

07:04.875 --> 07:06.959
It's Fran
who's the nice guy."

07:06.959 --> 07:09.417
I'm just so relieved
to be away from him.

07:09.417 --> 07:12.500
Aw, Jesus.
I knew we did
a number on you.

07:12.500 --> 07:14.166
What kind of number?

07:14.166 --> 07:17.750
You are incapable of loving
someone who is kind to you.

07:17.750 --> 07:19.834
Your father and I
were no example.

07:22.083 --> 07:24.291
I mean,
sure, he's nice,

07:24.291 --> 07:26.000
but underneath
all that niceness

07:26.000 --> 07:27.667
was this dirty
little secret

07:27.667 --> 07:30.250
that was eating away
at the core of our marriage.

07:30.250 --> 07:33.667
Some part of you
must have picked up
on that.

07:33.667 --> 07:35.000
I really didn't.

07:35.000 --> 07:38.000
- You didn't?
- No.

07:38.000 --> 07:40.625
You guys are great.
I like nice people.

07:40.625 --> 07:43.375
There's not a problem.
You didn't fuck me up.

07:46.458 --> 07:48.667
Aren't you
gonna at least
brush your teeth?

07:48.667 --> 07:50.250
Mm-mm.
I'm a morning brusher.

07:50.250 --> 07:53.333
- I just go hard at it
in the morning.
- Mm.

07:55.875 --> 07:57.208
I love you, Mom.

07:57.208 --> 07:59.000
I love you, too, baby.

08:02.708 --> 08:03.917
Don't worry
about snoring.

08:03.917 --> 08:06.417
I can sleep through
anything, even sex.

08:06.417 --> 08:07.834
Thanks.

08:07.834 --> 08:10.166
( moaning )

08:12.542 --> 08:14.208
- Are you gonna come?
- Uh-huh.

08:14.208 --> 08:16.917
- Are you gonna
come for me?
- Uh-huh.

08:16.917 --> 08:21.041
Okay, after you come,
pretend like you meant
to pull out

08:21.041 --> 08:23.917
and then you're gonna
freak out like you might've
gotten me pregnant.

08:23.917 --> 08:26.166
You don't want me
to pull out?

08:26.166 --> 08:28.417
No, no, I'm wearing a sponge.
I have a sponge in.

08:28.417 --> 08:31.125
Fuckin' knew that shit.
I knew that wasn't
your pussy wall.

08:31.125 --> 08:32.500
( moaning )

08:32.500 --> 08:34.166
Please remember
to pull out.

08:34.166 --> 08:36.917
Please, please.
Please don't come in me.

08:36.917 --> 08:38.417
Don't you dare.

08:38.417 --> 08:40.542
( moaning )
I would never.

08:40.542 --> 08:44.667
- Please pull out.
Don't forget to pull out.
- Okay, I won't.

08:44.667 --> 08:48.041
( moans )
Oh, fuck!

08:48.041 --> 08:50.125
- ( moans )
- Fuck!

08:50.125 --> 08:51.583
I'm sorry.

08:51.583 --> 08:54.000
I came in you.

08:54.000 --> 08:56.208
( laughs )

08:56.208 --> 08:58.750
Oh, God,
what am I gonna
tell my parents?

08:58.750 --> 09:01.125
What the fuck
am I gonna tell Coach?

09:01.125 --> 09:02.625
( laughs )

09:02.625 --> 09:04.125
He'll never let me
borrow his car again.

09:04.125 --> 09:05.792
I'm gonna lose
my scholarship.

09:05.792 --> 09:09.125
- ( laughs )
- I can't pay
for the doctors' fees.

09:09.125 --> 09:11.125
You're brilliant.

09:23.792 --> 09:25.792
My sister's in town.

09:28.667 --> 09:31.417
- Oh, yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

09:31.417 --> 09:33.500
Yeah, she e-mailed me
out of nowhere

09:33.500 --> 09:36.917
and asked if I would
have dinner with her
tomorrow.

09:36.917 --> 09:40.291
So you want me to go?

09:40.291 --> 09:44.000
I-- well, I--

09:44.000 --> 09:46.583
I honestly didn't think
you'd be interested.

09:46.583 --> 09:48.792
Well, only if you want me to.
I'd fucking love to meet her.

09:48.792 --> 09:51.458
I-- I wasn't saying it
so that you'd feel obligated.

09:51.458 --> 09:52.875
I don't feel obligated.

09:52.875 --> 09:54.125
Good 'cause you're not.

09:54.125 --> 09:55.708
Good 'cause I'm going.

09:55.708 --> 09:57.834
( laughing )

09:59.959 --> 10:03.417
With your shoulders,
your shoulders.

10:03.417 --> 10:05.667
Now lead with your cunt.

10:05.667 --> 10:07.917
- Ew.
- That's good.
Cunt it.

10:07.917 --> 10:09.500
Yes.
Let's see that cunt.

10:17.333 --> 10:20.208
Yeah, nice and stiff.

10:20.208 --> 10:23.250
Use your arms,
use your arms,
yeah!

10:23.250 --> 10:26.208
- I'm flying!
- ( all chuckle )

10:26.208 --> 10:29.625
- Whoo-hoo!
- There you go.

10:29.625 --> 10:32.333
I feel like a baby.

10:32.333 --> 10:34.458
Good job.
Good job.

10:34.458 --> 10:35.917
Loreen:
Yeah.

10:39.208 --> 10:42.041
Hannah, you're too close.
I can see you.

10:42.041 --> 10:44.041
Well, where am
I supposed to go?

10:44.041 --> 10:47.708
You can go anywhere,
just not by me.

10:47.708 --> 10:49.375
We're supposed to be
by ourselves

10:49.375 --> 10:51.083
for at least an hour.

10:51.083 --> 10:54.125
I don't know why
you brought a swimsuit.

10:54.125 --> 10:56.750
Uh, 'cause it's a retreat.
I assumed there'd be a pool.

10:56.750 --> 10:59.667
- Oh, Hannah.
- Anyway, I shouldn't be
out here with bare legs.

10:59.667 --> 11:01.417
I could get
Lyme's disease.

11:04.917 --> 11:06.250
Yes!

11:06.250 --> 11:09.542
( phone rings )

11:09.542 --> 11:12.000
Hi, Banana.
Is everything okay?

11:12.000 --> 11:14.583
I thought the itinerary said
no phones this weekend.

11:14.583 --> 11:17.750
Well, I'm a real rule-breaker.
Check it out.

11:17.750 --> 11:19.542
I miss you.
How are you?

11:19.542 --> 11:21.750
Tad:
I'm fine.
I miss you, too.

11:21.750 --> 11:25.625
And your mother, has--
has she said anything?

11:25.625 --> 11:28.166
Is she leaning towards
us being together?

11:28.166 --> 11:29.959
Dad, I don't know.
We've just been doing
trust falls

11:29.959 --> 11:31.875
and being berated
by very toned women.

11:31.875 --> 11:33.917
- I hate everybody.
- ( chuckles )

11:33.917 --> 11:36.083
Anyway, I don't even know
why you'd want to stay married.

11:36.083 --> 11:37.917
You're a gay person.
It's not like--

11:37.917 --> 11:39.166
shit, Papa,
I gotta go.

11:39.166 --> 11:40.500
There's a bunch
of divorced Cathys

11:40.500 --> 11:41.917
coming towards me.
I love you, okay?

11:41.917 --> 11:44.208
- Hey, if your mom--
- ( phone beeping )

11:48.208 --> 11:53.208
I mean, honestly,
I feel like I'm inside,
like, Katy Perry's vagina.

11:53.208 --> 11:54.667
- I know.
- Yeah.

11:54.667 --> 11:56.458
And that's the amazing
thing about Japan.

11:56.458 --> 11:59.000
It's like
whatever these people do,
they do it full-out,

11:59.000 --> 12:01.417
they do not apologize,
and they make it cute.

12:01.417 --> 12:03.083
Yeah, like,
I cannot deny

12:03.083 --> 12:05.291
that everything
I'm seeing

12:05.291 --> 12:07.041
is exactly
what we're into.

12:07.041 --> 12:08.959
I know.
Plus sometimes at night,

12:08.959 --> 12:13.166
I think about Japan
and I'm like, "Did I create
this country in my mind?"

12:13.166 --> 12:16.041
Oh, my God.
Look, three little
tiny sailor girls.

12:16.041 --> 12:18.417
Shoshanna: Oh, yeah, I know.
That's actually their
school uniform.

12:18.417 --> 12:19.375
Abigail:
What?

12:19.375 --> 12:21.417
Just-- you just
slide them in.

12:21.417 --> 12:22.792
( laughs )
Oh, my God.

12:22.792 --> 12:24.708
It's like nothing.
You should just pretend--

12:24.708 --> 12:27.458
- It seems disgusting.
- No, but you've gotten
a pedicure before,

12:27.458 --> 12:28.959
so it's essentially
the same thing.

12:28.959 --> 12:30.834
- Just put them in.
- Let's do it at the same time.

12:30.834 --> 12:32.708
- Okay, you ready?
Okay, on three.
- Okay, one...

12:32.708 --> 12:33.959
Both:
Two, three.

12:33.959 --> 12:37.417
Oh, my God.
Oh, God!

12:37.417 --> 12:39.333
You just gotta breathe.
Just breathe.

12:39.333 --> 12:41.625
- Just breathe.
- ( groans ) Oh, my God.

12:41.625 --> 12:45.208
Oh, my God,
one is, like,
going raw dog on me.

12:45.208 --> 12:47.333
I'm so impressed,
Shoshanna.

12:47.333 --> 12:50.125
I feel like
you used to be
really work-driven

12:50.125 --> 12:54.542
and now you've
learned to slow down
and just enjoy life.

12:54.542 --> 12:57.166
Yeah, I did.
You have to enjoy life.

12:57.166 --> 12:59.333
You cannot rush
a cherry blossom.

12:59.333 --> 13:00.750
Wow.

13:00.750 --> 13:03.041
See? I get it.

13:03.041 --> 13:05.083
That's beautiful.

13:05.083 --> 13:07.041
That's Japan.

13:07.041 --> 13:10.000
You can't keep
breaking the rules.

13:10.000 --> 13:12.333
You cannot grab my phone
out of my hands.

13:12.333 --> 13:13.542
I am an adult.

13:13.542 --> 13:15.125
Adults follow rules.

13:15.125 --> 13:16.667
Please hand me
back my phone.

13:16.667 --> 13:18.834
I do not want to have
a physical tussle with you.

13:18.834 --> 13:20.041
I am just trying
to give you--

13:20.041 --> 13:21.750
- Hey, Sam!
- Yes! Yes?

13:21.750 --> 13:23.208
- Is everything
copacetic?
- Yes.

13:23.208 --> 13:24.959
Yes, it is.
It's just, um--

13:24.959 --> 13:28.041
God, it's just
our guest here was
on her phone again.

13:28.041 --> 13:31.041
Oh, okay, well,
I'm sure Hannah has
a great reason for it.

13:32.875 --> 13:35.750
Thank you, Sam.

13:35.750 --> 13:37.417
Thank you, Sam.

13:41.000 --> 13:43.750
- I do have a great reason.
- Oh, you don't need one.

13:43.750 --> 13:48.125
This weekend shouldn't
be about someone jamming
something down your throat.

13:48.125 --> 13:50.041
You know?
If you're not into it,
then fuck it.

13:50.041 --> 13:53.333
I'm into it.
I'm into--

13:53.333 --> 13:54.417
I hate it.

13:54.417 --> 13:55.959
I've hated
every moment of it.

13:55.959 --> 13:58.166
I really hate
being outside.

13:58.166 --> 14:00.458
But I realized
I'm more into being
here and hating it

14:00.458 --> 14:02.375
than I am with spending time
with my own boyfriend.

14:02.375 --> 14:04.917
- That's not a good sign.
- That's not a good sign, no.

14:04.917 --> 14:06.834
God, this is
a really hard
e-mail to write.

14:06.834 --> 14:09.000
- Well, maybe you
should do it in person.
- No, it's not that.

14:09.000 --> 14:11.250
He's just really judgy
about grammar stuff.

14:11.250 --> 14:13.000
He sounds like
a real fucking winner.

14:13.000 --> 14:16.125
No, he's nice.
He's so nice.

14:16.125 --> 14:17.750
You know what?
Fuck nice.

14:17.750 --> 14:20.750
Nice is a mask
angry people wear to hide
their inner assholes.

14:20.750 --> 14:23.750
- Yeah.
- Look, you do you,
all right?

14:26.125 --> 14:29.959
'Cause you're
way too luscious to be
with the wrong guy.

So, listen, the thing
to know about Minerva

15:07.667 --> 15:12.166
is that we've both slept
with all the same people.

15:12.166 --> 15:14.917
Except-- except my father.
That was just her.

15:14.917 --> 15:16.500
What the shit?

15:16.500 --> 15:19.250
I mean, they're not related,
so it's not what you think,

15:19.250 --> 15:22.000
but-- so, they ran
into each other at a bar
or something

15:22.000 --> 15:25.333
and-- it was hardly creepy
in the traditional sense.

15:25.333 --> 15:27.083
Besides,
her dad's Scottish.

15:27.083 --> 15:29.834
All I'm saying is that
if you want to fuck her,

15:29.834 --> 15:33.250
I mean, I won't care.
I'm used to it.

15:33.250 --> 15:35.333
Minni, hi.

15:35.333 --> 15:37.500
- Aw.
- Hey.

15:37.500 --> 15:39.667
Seriously, you are wee.
What the fuck?

15:39.667 --> 15:41.583
- Yeah, I got giardia.
- Amazing.

15:41.583 --> 15:43.542
Yeah, and it's
got rid of all the...

15:43.542 --> 15:46.166
- Hi, I'm Ad--
- This is Adam.
He's my boyfriend.

15:46.166 --> 15:47.583
Yay.

15:47.583 --> 15:49.959
Boyfriend?
God.

15:51.166 --> 15:52.500
Aw.

15:52.500 --> 15:53.959
Nice to meet you.

15:55.542 --> 15:57.834
All right, all right.
Easy.

16:00.542 --> 16:02.708
Well, the salmon's
very good.

16:02.708 --> 16:04.667
- Mm-hmm.
- Just needs
a little salt.

16:04.667 --> 16:06.250
It needs,
like, all the salt
in the known universe

16:06.250 --> 16:07.458
and there's none here.

16:07.458 --> 16:09.792
Oh, here.
I carry some.

16:09.792 --> 16:12.834
I have to be really careful
because I work out so hard

16:12.834 --> 16:14.375
that I drink
a lot of water.

16:14.375 --> 16:17.250
One time, I almost
drowned from the inside.

16:17.250 --> 16:19.917
I've been saying for years
that water's basically poison.

16:19.917 --> 16:22.250
Kathy:
Have you ever been
to Red Mountain Ranch?

16:22.250 --> 16:24.250
They really know
how to do low sodium.

16:24.250 --> 16:27.333
They make an asparagus
and leek egg white quiche.

16:27.333 --> 16:29.166
You take a bite,
you die.

16:29.166 --> 16:33.083
At Miraval,
they have these portobello
and lentil roll-ups.

16:33.083 --> 16:35.458
Delicious.
I ate them for every meal.

16:35.458 --> 16:37.375
And then again
for dessert.

16:37.375 --> 16:39.375
I can make pizza.

16:44.458 --> 16:47.834
At Esalen for breakfast,
they have six different
kinds of yogurt.

16:47.834 --> 16:50.083
Not flavors, kinds.

16:50.083 --> 16:52.458
- Greek yogurt and--
- Why don't we just focus

16:52.458 --> 16:54.542
on the meal
that we're having
right here, right now?

16:54.542 --> 16:56.625
This meal.

16:56.625 --> 16:58.125
Sweetie.

17:01.125 --> 17:02.834
I wonder what they'll
have for dessert.

17:02.834 --> 17:04.541
( all chuckle )

17:05.750 --> 17:08.916
What? I was talking
about the food here.

17:22.834 --> 17:25.416
- Hey, you.
- Hi.

17:25.416 --> 17:29.250
- Hi.
- Sorry, I'm allergic to bread.
I thought that was a nut.

17:29.250 --> 17:31.542
You are tense.

17:31.542 --> 17:34.750
Oh, yeah, I'm having some--
some family problems,

17:34.750 --> 17:36.625
so I may be
a little wound tight.

17:36.625 --> 17:39.834
Yeah, well, let's get you
to the sauna and I'll
stretch you out.

17:39.834 --> 17:41.291
I couldn't
do that to you.

17:41.291 --> 17:42.917
It's your dinner break.

17:42.917 --> 17:44.417
Anyway, my mom says
I'm not capable

17:44.417 --> 17:46.125
of centering myself
emotionally or spiritually

17:46.125 --> 17:48.208
'cause she and my dad
fucked me up so good.

17:48.208 --> 17:49.750
Oh.
( chuckles )

17:49.750 --> 17:51.125
Well, let's see
about that, huh?

17:51.125 --> 17:52.375
All right?

17:52.375 --> 17:53.959
Come on.

17:53.959 --> 17:55.291
Thank you.

17:55.291 --> 17:58.250
Hannah:
Wow! I feel so open
and balanced.

17:58.250 --> 18:00.208
That's what
this work's all about--

18:00.208 --> 18:02.291
balancing and toning.

18:02.291 --> 18:04.291
And you'll find
that as you continue,

18:04.291 --> 18:07.333
all this layer
will just melt away.

18:07.333 --> 18:10.291
Like a layer of emotions
or like a layer of fat?

18:10.291 --> 18:12.500
- What?
- ( both scream )

18:12.500 --> 18:13.834
Sorry, sorry.

18:15.875 --> 18:18.041
That's--
you're so sweaty.

18:18.041 --> 18:20.542
I know.
I didn't mean
to do that.

18:41.834 --> 18:45.041
You know, actually,
I've never had sex
with a woman before.

18:45.041 --> 18:48.208
I mean, I've done other stuff.
I went to Oberlin, so I'm not,
like, a monster,

18:48.208 --> 18:50.708
but my dad's gay,
so there might be
a genetic--

18:50.708 --> 18:53.041
I've never slept
with a student before.

18:53.041 --> 18:55.834
Aw, you don't
have to say that.

18:59.375 --> 19:02.291
Barb:
I blame it on Viagra.

19:02.291 --> 19:04.291
Larry and I were together
for 42 years

19:04.291 --> 19:06.083
and then he starts
popping the blue pill

19:06.083 --> 19:09.792
and then he leaves me
for his assistant, Flavia.

19:09.792 --> 19:11.917
Oh, my God.
That's terrible.

19:11.917 --> 19:13.917
Barb:
He's 70 years old.

19:13.917 --> 19:17.041
I said to him,
"You've turned
into a cliché."

19:17.041 --> 19:18.708
But then what am I?

19:18.708 --> 19:23.750
Divorced,
at a spa with strangers,
complaining about men.

19:23.750 --> 19:25.500
Oh, I love
being single again.

19:25.500 --> 19:27.458
- Loreen: Really?
- Sure.

19:27.458 --> 19:31.542
I want to stay in, I stay in.
I want to go out, I go out.

19:31.542 --> 19:34.834
I mean, I never
really want to go out.

19:34.834 --> 19:38.417
Just give me a good book
and a bottle of wine
and there you have it.

19:38.417 --> 19:40.375
The perfect morning.

19:40.375 --> 19:43.792
Kathy:
My friend Marsha put herself
online on the Match.com.

19:43.792 --> 19:45.583
- Ah.
- She met a guy,
a lawyer

19:45.583 --> 19:47.417
who's a partner
in his firm.

19:47.417 --> 19:50.583
He swept her off her feet.
He took her to Vegas.

19:50.583 --> 19:53.166
Celine Dion,
front row, twice.

19:53.166 --> 19:56.750
Yeah, no, she's never
slept with anyone except
for her ex-husband.

19:56.750 --> 19:59.583
She said she had
the time of her life.

19:59.583 --> 20:02.375
Vaginal orgasms,
one after the other.

20:02.375 --> 20:03.834
Women:
Oh...

20:03.834 --> 20:07.875
Two weeks after
she gets home,
a burning.

20:07.875 --> 20:12.041
- Cathy: Uh-oh.
- Kathy: Herpes
and genital warts,

20:12.041 --> 20:15.708
mouth chlamydia
at 57 years old.

20:15.708 --> 20:17.333
- No, no, no, no.
- Koko: Wow.

20:19.959 --> 20:22.291
Well...

20:22.291 --> 20:23.917
my husband is gay.

20:25.834 --> 20:28.625
So?

20:28.625 --> 20:31.041
Yeah, that seems like
a nonissue to me.

20:31.041 --> 20:33.208
I would kill
for a gay husband.

20:33.208 --> 20:35.375
Oh, my God.
I wish I were gay.

20:35.375 --> 20:38.125
Kathy:
Honestly, Koko,
why are you here?

20:38.125 --> 20:40.667
( conversation continues
indistinctly )

20:45.667 --> 20:48.750
( moaning )

20:50.500 --> 20:52.458
Oh, yeah.

20:52.458 --> 20:53.834
It's really hot.

20:53.834 --> 20:55.333
I'm feeling really hot.

20:55.333 --> 20:57.125
Yeah, you'll just
get used to it.

20:57.125 --> 20:59.333
- ( groans ) Oh, my God.
- It's okay, it's just new.

20:59.333 --> 21:01.708
- ( moaning )
- Okay, okay.

21:01.708 --> 21:03.333
- Oh, yeah.
- Okay...

21:03.333 --> 21:05.125
- Oh, yeah, there.
- ...I think I have to stop.

21:05.125 --> 21:06.333
I'd really like to stop.

21:06.333 --> 21:08.166
No, no, no, no.
I'm really close.

21:08.166 --> 21:10.041
- Just let me come.
- Nope, I'm gonna
need to stop.

21:10.041 --> 21:11.834
- Please.
- Please, it's just
30 seconds.

21:11.834 --> 21:13.500
- No, no, no, no, please--
- I'm sorry, Holly.

21:13.500 --> 21:15.208
- Let me go.
- Just give me 30 seconds.
Just 30 seconds.

21:15.208 --> 21:16.750
I can't.
I really can't.

21:16.750 --> 21:18.333
- I really can't
do 30 seconds.
- Ah, fuck.

21:18.333 --> 21:19.834
I really can't even
do 30 seconds.

21:19.834 --> 21:22.500
( moans )
Oh, God. Fuck.

21:22.500 --> 21:25.333
( moaning )

21:25.333 --> 21:27.208
Oh, yeah.

21:27.208 --> 21:29.708
Oh, fuck.

21:29.708 --> 21:32.000
( moaning )
Oh, yeah!

21:39.667 --> 21:42.041
( moaning )

21:44.208 --> 21:46.875
( sobbing )

21:53.291 --> 21:55.291
So, while I wait
for our legal separation,

21:55.291 --> 21:57.208
he's letting me
stay in the house,

21:57.208 --> 22:00.792
which is sweet of him
since I really didn't
behave well at all.

22:00.792 --> 22:02.667
And I'm getting
spousal support

22:02.667 --> 22:04.041
even though I actually
have more money

22:04.041 --> 22:07.125
because the trust fund
doesn't count as income.

22:07.125 --> 22:11.000
Speaking of money,
I do have something that
I've been meaning to ask you.

22:11.000 --> 22:12.291
Shoot.

22:12.291 --> 22:15.917
So, I think I told you
that I'm trying

22:15.917 --> 22:18.750
to go back to school
to become a therapist.

22:18.750 --> 22:23.750
But the thing is,
I am not eligible
for any financial aid

22:23.750 --> 22:25.583
because I'm
a foreign student.

22:25.583 --> 22:28.417
So I need money.

22:28.417 --> 22:30.417
Like, a bunch.

22:30.417 --> 22:33.500
Grandma cut me off
after rehab.

22:33.500 --> 22:36.500
Yeah, she said so.
So lame.

22:36.500 --> 22:39.542
But you should really have
hidden your drugs better.

22:39.542 --> 22:41.417
Jessa:
But she didn't
cut you off.

22:41.417 --> 22:42.792
( scoffs )

22:42.792 --> 22:45.583
Minni, I swear to you,
I will pay you back
every cent

22:45.583 --> 22:49.834
as soon as I could,
as soon as I had my own
business, which I will have.

22:49.834 --> 22:52.125
Jessa, you have to be
fucking kidding me.

22:52.125 --> 22:54.542
No, I'm not.
I'm really not
kidding you.

22:54.542 --> 22:57.959
I found
something that I love,
that I really love,

22:57.959 --> 23:02.291
and there's so much
that I have to learn,
and I want to learn it.

23:02.291 --> 23:04.125
More than anything,
I want to learn it.

23:04.125 --> 23:05.834
Minni:
Well, that's
a beautiful sentiment,

23:05.834 --> 23:07.959
but when have you ever
stuck to a single thing?

23:07.959 --> 23:10.542
You can't expect me to sink
my money into another whim.

23:10.542 --> 23:12.000
Jessa:
Well, it's not
your money.

23:12.000 --> 23:13.708
It takes a certain passion
to see things through

23:13.708 --> 23:15.125
and you've never had that.

23:15.125 --> 23:16.792
Maybe it's because Mum
was always easy on you

23:16.792 --> 23:21.375
or your face
is so symmetrical,
but it's left you soft.

23:21.375 --> 23:23.375
What are you
talking about?

23:23.375 --> 23:25.875
I'm sorry to be the one
to tell you things that
you don't want to hear,

23:25.875 --> 23:28.000
but I know you, Jessa.
I know you.

23:28.000 --> 23:31.125
No, you don't.

23:34.917 --> 23:36.750
Okay, Romeo.

23:36.750 --> 23:38.250
No, you don't.

23:38.250 --> 23:40.834
Jesus fucking Christ.
You don't know her at all.

23:40.834 --> 23:45.500
She's a beautiful
fuckin' rainbow,

23:45.500 --> 23:47.458
cutting and sublime.

23:47.458 --> 23:49.667
And she's gonna be
the best fucking
therapist ever.

23:49.667 --> 23:52.458
I envy her future patients
because she's a truth-teller.

23:52.458 --> 23:55.208
And her perfect face
is the least beautiful
thing about her.

23:55.208 --> 23:56.500
I'll pay
for your schooling.

23:59.458 --> 24:01.708
I'll pay
for your schooling.

24:01.708 --> 24:03.500
( laughs )
What?

24:03.500 --> 24:05.875
- Yeah, yeah.
- No.

24:05.875 --> 24:07.959
I made a fuckton of money
in all those Big Pharma
commercials.

24:07.959 --> 24:10.333
It's just sitting in the bank.
It should go to something good.

24:10.333 --> 24:13.458
- You're something good.
- ( laughs )

24:13.458 --> 24:15.125
You're ser--
are you serious?

24:15.125 --> 24:16.667
Yes.

24:16.667 --> 24:19.834
So nice.
That's brilliant.

24:19.834 --> 24:21.375
- Jessa: Thank you.
- Cool.

24:21.375 --> 24:23.542
( laughs )

24:26.583 --> 24:29.041
Thank you
for forcing me
to eat this

24:29.041 --> 24:33.542
because I feel like
my mouth is experiencing
intense personal growth.

24:33.542 --> 24:34.917
So, it actually is--

24:34.917 --> 24:37.250
that's "umami,"
the elusive fifth taste.

24:37.250 --> 24:38.834
Mm.

24:38.834 --> 24:41.625
She has become
so knowledgeable
in so short time.

24:41.625 --> 24:44.291
You guys
are the cutest.

24:44.291 --> 24:46.750
I want to watch
a reality show about
you called, like,

24:46.750 --> 24:49.375
"Yosh and Shosh
Take the City"

24:49.375 --> 24:51.041
anytime I have the flu.

24:51.041 --> 24:54.375
Soon we will
travel to Kamakura,
that's my place,

24:54.375 --> 24:57.542
- and Shoshanna can meet
my grandmother.
- Yeah.

24:57.542 --> 25:00.667
And then we will lose
our virginities
to each other.

25:00.667 --> 25:02.834
Mm-hmm.

25:02.834 --> 25:05.250
Holy hell.

25:05.250 --> 25:06.917
- Okay, wow.
- Yeah, that's--

25:06.917 --> 25:11.792
That's a relationship
hallmark, and that's cool.

25:11.792 --> 25:13.291
You ladies
can share tales.

25:13.291 --> 25:15.250
I'm going to make
quick stop at the bathroom.

25:15.250 --> 25:18.166
- Okay.
- Okay.

25:18.166 --> 25:20.083
Later.

25:20.083 --> 25:23.417
It is fucking
bonkers to me

25:23.417 --> 25:26.917
that that insane piece
is still a virgin.

25:30.250 --> 25:31.792
Are you okay?

25:31.792 --> 25:33.667
Um, yeah, yeah.

25:33.667 --> 25:36.959
I'm, um--
I'm great, you know?

25:36.959 --> 25:41.417
I work at, um--
as the assistant manager

25:41.417 --> 25:44.667
in the second biggest
cat café in Tokyo

25:44.667 --> 25:46.667
and everybody's
really jealous about that,

25:46.667 --> 25:48.708
and I'm dating
this beautiful
Japanese man,

25:48.708 --> 25:51.458
and we're gonna lose
our virginities
to each other,

25:51.458 --> 25:52.917
so everything's
really perfect.

25:52.917 --> 25:54.625
You know, like,
my life is perfect.

25:54.625 --> 25:56.625
- Yeah, you seem great.
- Yeah.

25:56.625 --> 25:58.250
Yeah, you're not, like--

25:58.250 --> 26:00.583
oh, wait, you're,
like, fully crying.

26:00.583 --> 26:02.250
- Yeah.
- Are you okay?

26:04.792 --> 26:06.583
I'm really sad.

26:08.083 --> 26:10.166
And...

26:10.166 --> 26:12.000
I'm really
fucking lonely.

26:12.000 --> 26:14.250
I'm so homesick,
and I swear to God

26:14.250 --> 26:18.125
if one more person
that I bump into bows
and says, "I'm sorry,"

26:18.125 --> 26:21.250
I'm gonna, like,
fucking cut somebody,
you know?

26:21.250 --> 26:24.166
Yeah, of course.
You're in fucking
outer space.

26:27.500 --> 26:30.041
I'm sorry, um...

26:30.041 --> 26:31.792
I really have
to go home.

26:31.792 --> 26:33.333
Okay.

26:41.333 --> 26:42.625
( sighs )

26:42.625 --> 26:44.834
( door squeaks )

26:47.750 --> 26:50.667
Where'd you go?

26:50.667 --> 26:52.291
I was following
my inner queen

26:52.291 --> 26:54.208
and she makes
terrible decisions,

26:54.208 --> 26:56.208
so I think I'm gonna
abdicate the throne.

26:56.208 --> 26:58.166
Aw, sweetie.

27:01.208 --> 27:06.125
Well, I am gonna stay
with your father.

27:07.417 --> 27:08.917
What?

27:08.917 --> 27:10.792
I'm gonna stay.

27:10.792 --> 27:12.166
Are you sure?

27:12.166 --> 27:14.875
Yeah, I've thought
about it a lot.

27:14.875 --> 27:17.208
And what am I gonna do,
go on a date on the Internet?

27:17.208 --> 27:20.875
Can you imagine?
I don't even want to talk
to the people I like.

27:20.875 --> 27:23.208
Even if I fell in love--
say I fell in love,

27:23.208 --> 27:24.667
what then?

27:24.667 --> 27:26.667
I don't know.
You'd be in love.

27:26.667 --> 27:27.959
No.

27:27.959 --> 27:31.750
We would have two years
of passion at best,

27:31.750 --> 27:34.417
and then, what, he would
get Alzheimer's disease

27:34.417 --> 27:36.417
or prostate cancer
and there I am

27:36.417 --> 27:38.208
draining his catheter
for the rest of my life,

27:38.208 --> 27:41.208
and this is a man
I don't even know.

27:41.208 --> 27:44.417
So I might as well stay.

27:44.417 --> 27:47.375
All right, I know
it sounds sad to you,

27:47.375 --> 27:51.750
but I like our house,
and your father's very nice,

27:51.750 --> 27:54.125
and he makes me laugh
when he does that Chris Rock.

27:54.125 --> 27:59.208
And he plays Scrabble
really well.

27:59.208 --> 28:01.583
These things
count for a lot.

28:04.750 --> 28:06.917
( sighs )

28:09.250 --> 28:12.875
If I had known
20 years ago...

28:20.000 --> 28:23.250
I think you guys
really did fuck me up.
