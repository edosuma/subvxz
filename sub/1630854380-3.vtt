from the start--

1:02:21.740 --> 1:02:23.108
<i>we're not gonna play
a scared game.</i>

1:02:23.108 --> 1:02:24.476
<i>We didn't. We sure did not.</i>

1:02:24.476 --> 1:02:25.744
And we gave these vets
a run for their money.

1:02:25.744 --> 1:02:27.479
We could see that
they're intimidated.

1:02:27.479 --> 1:02:29.782
<i>We found ourselves right back
in the elimination zone,</i>

1:02:29.782 --> 1:02:31.350
<i>and, you know,
if the shoe fits,</i>

1:02:31.350 --> 1:02:32.551
you gotta wear it,

1:02:32.551 --> 1:02:34.720
and, you know,
the shoe fit tonight.

1:02:34.720 --> 1:02:37.122
<i>- It is what it is,
but I gave it all that I had.</i>

1:02:37.122 --> 1:02:38.457
[grunts]

1:02:38.457 --> 1:02:39.958
I hope that
this won't be the last time

1:02:39.958 --> 1:02:41.260
that I'm on "The Challenge."

1:02:41.260 --> 1:02:42.828
<i>I feel like I proved to myself</i>

1:02:42.828 --> 1:02:44.963
<i>and to my family, my friends,
and the world, like,</i>

1:02:44.963 --> 1:02:46.498
<i>I am capable. I am strong.</i>

1:02:46.498 --> 1:02:47.800
And just being
Johnny's partner,

1:02:47.800 --> 1:02:49.768
it definitely
made me stronger altogether,

1:02:49.768 --> 1:02:52.671
so I definitely think
I'll be back on "The Challenge"

1:02:52.671 --> 1:02:54.406
to [bleep]
some more [bleep] up.

1:02:59.001 --> 1:03:00.403
<i>- With Laura I just feel like</i>

1:03:00.403 --> 1:03:02.705
<i>I have a person that I know
I can trust.</i>

1:03:02.705 --> 1:03:04.941
- You think that people in here
are gonna have your back?

1:03:04.941 --> 1:03:06.309
'Cause now you know
I don't have your back.

1:03:06.309 --> 1:03:08.111
- You made a smart move.

1:03:08.111 --> 1:03:10.513
It just sucks,
the repercussions of it.

1:03:10.513 --> 1:03:12.048
- What's up there?
- Today's challenge is

1:03:12.048 --> 1:03:14.617
gonna be taking place
300 feet in the air.

1:03:14.617 --> 1:03:16.000
- Oh, my God!
