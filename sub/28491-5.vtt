44:35.877 --> 44:38.293
- Good morning, Miss Lister.

44:38.377 --> 44:39.377
- Hmm!

44:39.460 --> 44:42.043
James' "Life of Charlemagne."

44:42.126 --> 44:44.001
Yes, that's very good.

44:44.085 --> 44:45.669
I've read that...

44:45.752 --> 44:47.835
twice.

44:47.919 --> 44:49.543
It's excellent.

44:49.627 --> 44:52.627
- What can I do for you
this morning, Miss Lister?

44:55.585 --> 44:58.710
- I'm looking for
a Book of Common Prayer.

44:58.794 --> 45:00.502
Gilt-edged, bound--

45:00.585 --> 45:03.877
if you have it--
in red Moroccan leather

45:03.960 --> 45:07.043
with an attractively marbled
flyleaf.

45:07.126 --> 45:10.251
- I do have one
exactly like that

45:10.335 --> 45:12.835
but at 8 shillings.

45:12.960 --> 45:14.001
- Good.

45:29.669 --> 45:31.877
[chuckles]

45:31.960 --> 45:35.126
[dog barking]
[indistinct chatter]

45:36.126 --> 45:37.543
- So what have you heard?

45:37.627 --> 45:39.710
- One of the men at Swan Bank
told me this morning

45:39.794 --> 45:41.251
that her land steward
has invited bids

45:41.335 --> 45:45.210
for the sinking
of a new pit above Conery Wood.

45:45.293 --> 45:46.794
- Mr. Rawson, please.
[coins jingle]

45:46.877 --> 45:48.043
- I've got it!
- I think I got one.

45:48.126 --> 45:51.210
- So that's right on top
of where the trespass is.

45:51.293 --> 45:52.543
They're auctioning the job off

45:52.627 --> 45:56.335
at the Stags Head at Mytholm
a week on Friday.

46:00.085 --> 46:02.377
We have to agree to her price
for the upper bed.

46:02.460 --> 46:04.418
You have to let me go and
offer her what she's asking.

46:04.502 --> 46:07.543
- I'm not paying
her fucking silly prices.

46:07.627 --> 46:09.085
Does she think we're stupid?

46:09.168 --> 46:10.710
- No, she thinks
we're stealing her coal.

46:15.919 --> 46:17.877
She knows
we're stealing her coal,

46:17.960 --> 46:19.669
and she wants paying for it.

46:19.752 --> 46:21.585
I think it's got to the stage
where we--

46:21.669 --> 46:24.418
where you have to accept
we have no choice,

46:24.502 --> 46:25.794
not if we want to stay
in production

46:25.877 --> 46:28.126
and not get found out
and, God knows,

46:28.210 --> 46:30.001
not have legal action
taken against us.

46:30.085 --> 46:32.752
- What would it cost,
something like that?

46:32.835 --> 46:36.585
Rough estimate, if she was to
sink a pit like that herself.

46:36.669 --> 46:39.085
- 2,000.

46:39.168 --> 46:41.293
And it is true,
what Mother said.

46:41.377 --> 46:42.919
Apparently,
she's over at Crow Nest

46:43.001 --> 46:44.418
morning, noon, and night.

46:44.502 --> 46:46.168
And if she really does
have her hand

46:46.251 --> 46:48.251
in Ann Walker's purse, then...

46:48.335 --> 46:50.627
she could have a pit sunk
within six months.

46:50.710 --> 46:52.502
- So why is anyone
letting her have her hands

46:52.585 --> 46:54.710
in Ann Walker's...

46:54.794 --> 46:56.377
anything, for God's sake?

46:56.460 --> 46:57.627
- I don't know.

46:57.710 --> 46:59.460
But if they're friends,
why shouldn't she?

46:59.543 --> 47:00.794
Who's going to stop her?

47:00.877 --> 47:02.085
Until she marries,
it's her money.

47:02.168 --> 47:04.126
She can do with it
as she likes.

47:04.210 --> 47:07.043
Christopher.
Christopher.

47:08.710 --> 47:10.168
Why don't I arrange
to see her and--

47:10.251 --> 47:11.794
- No.

47:11.877 --> 47:14.627
No, love, no.

47:14.710 --> 47:18.001
If she wants to start
running with the big dogs,

47:18.085 --> 47:19.669
then she's gonna have
to find out what it's like

47:19.752 --> 47:22.460
when they really
start biting each other.

It's exquisite.

48:30.752 --> 48:32.168
Thank you.

- You know, when you told me
about Mr. Ainsworth...

48:41.502 --> 48:43.460
Well, what he did--

48:43.543 --> 48:44.543
and I suspect it's something

48:44.627 --> 48:46.543
you've never told
anyone else...

48:46.627 --> 48:47.752
- Of course not.

48:47.835 --> 48:49.794
Who else could I have told?

48:55.460 --> 48:59.251
- When you told me,
it gave me a responsibility.

48:59.335 --> 49:02.752
It gave me a power over you,
which I intend to use wisely

49:02.835 --> 49:05.669
and very much
in your best interests.

I don't believe these
misgivings about Ainsworth

49:17.126 --> 49:19.543
will last
longer than a season.

49:21.001 --> 49:22.960
Now, come on,

49:23.001 --> 49:24.960
We can't keep avoiding
Miss Parkhill.

49:25.043 --> 49:27.210

after you left this morning,

49:27.293 --> 49:29.085
despite all the trouble
you took with her.

49:29.168 --> 49:32.126
- Well, then I shall
redouble my efforts.

49:32.210 --> 49:33.543
I'll have to.

49:33.627 --> 49:34.919
I can't go home.

49:35.001 --> 49:37.877
Marian's got
Mr. Abbott round for tea.

49:39.585 --> 49:41.627
- Mm, yes, no,

49:41.710 --> 49:43.877
the best thing you can do
with an old building like this

49:43.960 --> 49:45.877
is knock it down
and start again,

49:45.960 --> 49:48.001
because the land's
perfectly good,

49:48.085 --> 49:51.001
and it's in
a desirable enough position.

49:51.085 --> 49:54.710
I'm not saying you should,
obviously.

49:54.794 --> 49:57.293
It's over 400 years old.
It's a relic.

- Have more fruitcake,
Mr. Abbott.

49:58.794 --> 49:59.710
- And I know some people

49:59.794 --> 50:01.585
find that sort of thing
interesting,

50:01.669 --> 50:04.126
but, Miss Lister,
you're elderly.

50:04.210 --> 50:06.877
I hope you won't mind me
making that observation.

50:06.960 --> 50:10.168
It must be very cold for you
now winter's almost upon us.

50:10.251 --> 50:11.168
- Yes, but--

I have never once--

- Tell us about New Zealand.

- New Zealand?

50:54.627 --> 50:56.251
- And Australia.

50:56.335 --> 50:57.502
- What about New Zealand?

50:57.585 --> 50:59.335
- What fascinating countries
they must be.

50:59.418 --> 51:02.710
- I told my aunt and my father
and my sister

51:02.794 --> 51:04.293
that you had property
out there.

51:04.377 --> 51:05.710

[laughs] Yes.

51:05.794 --> 51:07.293
But I've never actually been.

- Oh, I thought--
- Lord, no.

51:09.919 --> 51:12.335
A voyage like that
would never do for me.

And anyway, I haven't time.

Anne's missed you.

51:29.835 --> 51:30.627
- Mm! Yes.

51:30.710 --> 51:32.585
I was looking forward
to meeting

51:32.669 --> 51:34.627
your elder daughter,
Captain Lister.

51:34.710 --> 51:36.001
You hear so many stories

51:36.085 --> 51:38.085
about her down in Halifax.

51:38.168 --> 51:41.251
Course, I always take them
with a pinch of salt.

51:41.335 --> 51:43.251
I'm sure I'd get on with her
perfectly well.

51:43.335 --> 51:44.960
I'll talk to anybody.

51:45.043 --> 51:46.794
- [laughs]

52:01.502 --> 52:03.377
- How about a walk?

52:06.460 --> 52:08.418
- Dr. Day said
not to exert myself

52:08.502 --> 52:10.001
any more than necessary.

52:10.085 --> 52:12.043
- A short walk.

52:12.126 --> 52:15.919
- He said my spine's too weak
even for that at present.

52:16.001 --> 52:17.126
I did ask him.

52:17.210 --> 52:19.460
- How can any medical man
in their right mind

52:19.543 --> 52:21.960
advise against fresh air?

52:22.043 --> 52:24.960
What do you think,
Miss Parkhill?

52:25.043 --> 52:28.126
- I imagine Dr. Day knows
what he's talking about,

52:28.210 --> 52:30.210
even if he didn't have
the benefit of studying

52:30.293 --> 52:33.085
under Monsieur Cuvier
in Paris.

52:36.043 --> 52:37.669
- [sighs]

52:37.752 --> 52:41.377
I think we should visit
Dr. Belcombe again in York.

52:41.460 --> 52:44.543
I think York would be
an all-round good thing.

52:44.627 --> 52:46.960
I could introduce you to some
of my better-connected friends,

52:47.043 --> 52:48.168
and you could have the benefit

52:48.251 --> 52:51.543
of the very best medical advice
at the same time.

52:52.752 --> 52:54.960
Come on, let's have a hit
of backgammon

52:55.043 --> 52:56.877
before we vegetate.

52:56.960 --> 53:00.460
Come and thrash me like
you usually do, Miss Walker.

53:12.085 --> 53:13.794
- You don't have to be here,

53:13.877 --> 53:16.543
Miss Lister,

53:16.627 --> 53:17.669
if you're bored,

53:17.752 --> 53:21.960
if you're itching for a walk.

53:22.043 --> 53:23.585
I came--

53:24.543 --> 53:27.168
I was asked here
by Miss Walker's aunt

53:27.251 --> 53:29.502
to keep her company whilst
she was under the weather.

53:29.585 --> 53:31.210
And to be candid,

53:31.293 --> 53:34.460
there barely seems any point
in me being here

53:34.543 --> 53:37.669
when you're here
so often.

53:37.752 --> 53:39.669
- [sighs]

53:39.752 --> 53:42.585
The more, the merrier,
surely, Miss Parkhill.

53:42.669 --> 53:43.794
Come on.

53:43.877 --> 53:46.877
Let's not fall out,
for Miss Walker's sake.

53:46.960 --> 53:48.669
It's entirely unnecessary,

53:48.752 --> 53:51.210
and we were all getting along
so nicely before.

53:51.293 --> 53:54.669
Let's have another go
at your past perfect.

54:00.502 --> 54:03.960
- Two's company.

54:08.335 --> 54:10.335
- Well, Miss Parkhill,

54:10.418 --> 54:13.418
if that's how you feel,
perhaps--

54:13.502 --> 54:16.210
I don't know--

54:16.293 --> 54:18.543
you should go home.

54:31.502 --> 54:34.001
- I'll be in the other room.

54:40.710 --> 54:42.210
- [sighs]

54:42.293 --> 54:43.126
[door clicks shut]

54:43.210 --> 54:45.585
- You shouldn't have
said that.

54:45.669 --> 54:47.835
She's my friend.
She's my guest.

54:47.919 --> 54:49.877
- Mrs. Priestley should never
have used her like that.

54:49.960 --> 54:50.960
- I can't do this.

54:51.043 --> 54:52.502
- I appreciate
it's not her fault.

54:52.585 --> 54:54.085
She's been put
in a difficult position, but--

54:54.168 --> 54:56.543
- I shouldn't have told you
about Mr. Ainsworth.

54:56.627 --> 54:57.669
I shouldn't have said
anything.

54:57.752 --> 54:59.293
I should've just
kept it all to myself.

54:59.377 --> 55:01.835
- No, you did absolutely
the right thing to tell me--

55:01.919 --> 55:04.085
- If only you'd allowed me
the time we that had agreed.

55:04.168 --> 55:06.293
If only we'd stuck to your
birthday for the yes or the no

55:06.377 --> 55:08.877
instead of forcing me
into that ridiculous business

55:08.960 --> 55:10.126
with the purse!

55:10.210 --> 55:11.210
- You came up with the ridic--

55:11.293 --> 55:12.293
with the business
with the purse.

55:12.377 --> 55:13.960
- Only because
I didn't know what to do

55:14.043 --> 55:15.335
because you were pushing me

55:15.418 --> 55:17.585
because I could
barely think straight!

55:17.669 --> 55:20.335
Then none of this
would've happened.

55:23.251 --> 55:25.585
- Let me go
and apologize to her.

55:25.669 --> 55:26.585
Come on, we can sort this out.

55:26.669 --> 55:27.835
I'll apologize to her, and--

55:27.919 --> 55:30.335
- I can't do this, Anne.

55:30.418 --> 55:32.377
- Yes, you can.

55:32.460 --> 55:34.752
- No, I can't.

55:34.835 --> 55:37.794
It's become impossible.

55:37.877 --> 55:40.293
I shall have to take
Mr. Ainsworth.

55:40.377 --> 55:41.543
- No.
- I shall.

55:41.627 --> 55:44.877
