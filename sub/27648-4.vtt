WEBVTT

00:06.063 --> 00:10.061
I'll be at the motel for two days.
Let me know.

00:13.997 --> 00:16.806
Just listen, OK? Actually
listen to me for once.

00:17.502 --> 00:20.337
"For once"?

00:20.438 --> 00:23.199
It's Taylor. She's borrowing
the car to go to Millwood.

00:23.360 --> 00:26.582
Mind if I join you actually?
I wanna go visit my mom.

00:26.882 --> 00:28.222
Yeah, sure.

00:28.247 --> 00:31.248
- You're staying at Wendy's?
- No. I'll stay at the motel.

00:33.277 --> 00:34.676
I'm talking to you

00:34.753 --> 00:36.812
and I decide when I go, Dad.

00:36.837 --> 00:38.696
- Let go of me!
- It's your dad.

00:38.721 --> 00:40.655
They found him in his room.

00:42.000 --> 00:48.074

01:25.203 --> 01:26.704
Come in.

01:33.078 --> 01:35.108
Coffee's hot.

01:36.081 --> 01:37.982
Take as much time as you need.

02:33.169 --> 02:35.270
They're expecting me.

02:36.140 --> 02:37.908
All right.

03:02.801 --> 03:06.630
That's him. That's my father.

03:23.822 --> 03:26.723
The last time we spoke was so awful.

03:27.523 --> 03:30.831
I know I shouldn't fixate
on it, but I can't...

03:32.397 --> 03:34.743
I can't stop thinking about it.

03:34.815 --> 03:38.133
- I know.
- I just wish I could go back

03:38.158 --> 03:40.862
and do things differently.

03:40.939 --> 03:42.991
Joanna, don't be so hard on yourself.

03:43.072 --> 03:45.340
You can't be nice to me right now.

03:47.412 --> 03:49.151
I'm sorry.

03:49.236 --> 03:51.404
I don't know how else to be.

03:51.880 --> 03:53.764
I'm sorry.

03:54.523 --> 03:56.353
I'm just...

03:59.105 --> 04:01.358
I, have to get to
the police station.

04:01.459 --> 04:02.993
They want me to make a statement.

04:03.070 --> 04:04.858
- I'll go with you.
- I said I'm fine...

04:04.883 --> 04:06.984
- It's no bother.
- I'll walk.

04:07.532 --> 04:09.042
Thank you.

04:09.634 --> 04:11.375
Joanna...

04:12.613 --> 04:14.685
anything you need,

04:14.873 --> 04:16.607
I'm here.

04:24.961 --> 04:26.929
Good job, boys.

04:30.662 --> 04:33.280
So, someone got the jump on him

04:33.305 --> 04:34.605
and smacked him with a bottle of booze.

04:34.629 --> 04:36.894
Unopened bottle of booze.
The cap and seal were found

04:36.995 --> 04:38.762
still intact in the broken bottle neck.

04:38.863 --> 04:41.031
He didn't even get to
enjoy a last drink.

04:41.132 --> 04:43.767
Doesn't look that way unless
this was bottle number 2.

04:43.868 --> 04:45.969
- They think he was inebriated?
- Tough to say.

04:46.070 --> 04:48.071
We'll know more when the
tox screen comes back.

04:49.955 --> 04:52.309
You'd have to get that angle just right.

04:52.410 --> 04:54.978
I mean, people don't normally
die from a knock on the head.

04:55.079 --> 04:56.850
Meaning the killing was unintentional.

04:56.965 --> 04:58.903
Or a crime of passion.

04:59.617 --> 05:01.575
Which would suggest

05:01.886 --> 05:04.150
that Hanley knew his attacker.

05:11.796 --> 05:13.764
You got the toast; I'll do the coffee.

05:13.865 --> 05:16.967
- Yeah.
- Sorry.

05:17.068 --> 05:19.203
It's been a while since I
had someone in the kitchen.

05:19.304 --> 05:21.045
Hey, Mom, why don't you sit down.

05:21.070 --> 05:23.304
Let me make you breakfast for once.

05:23.641 --> 05:25.842
- All right.
- OK.

05:28.084 --> 05:31.215
So, um... how's Molly been feeling?

05:31.316 --> 05:33.317
Aaah, the same.

05:34.253 --> 05:35.886
She's liking Winnipeg?

05:35.987 --> 05:38.472
Yeah. A bit too much.

05:38.990 --> 05:41.191
She's got a whole new
circle of friends, but...

05:41.609 --> 05:44.044
I mean, it's good to
see her happy again.

05:50.514 --> 05:52.594
Hey, Hey, Mom...

05:55.043 --> 05:56.951
- There's something I gotta talk...
- There's something I gotta

05:56.975 --> 05:58.875
talk to you about.

05:59.882 --> 06:01.983
You go first.

06:05.283 --> 06:08.692
I saw him last night, my father.

06:13.014 --> 06:15.495
I'll get rid of whoever that is.

06:21.399 --> 06:22.983
Gerrilynn Spence?

06:23.145 --> 06:24.568
You know it's me, Jason.

06:24.669 --> 06:26.714
I'm gonna need you to come
down to the station with us,

06:26.738 --> 06:29.488
- answer a few questions.
- What's this about?

06:29.846 --> 06:32.614
They can tell you more
back at the station, Ma'am,

06:33.041 --> 06:34.909
but I am gonna need you
to come with me now.

06:34.993 --> 06:38.628
Sure, just give me a minute.
I need to grab my purse.

06:47.044 --> 06:48.978
Mom, what do they want?

06:49.167 --> 06:51.891
Stay here, OK? I'll
call you if I need you.

07:05.593 --> 07:07.978
There's only been three
suspicious deaths in Millwood,

07:08.079 --> 07:09.861
and the RCMP was brought
in on all of them.

07:09.886 --> 07:12.046
They're not better than us.
We don't know what happened

07:12.116 --> 07:13.760
here, alright? When we get
the coroner's report back,

07:13.784 --> 07:15.238
we'll have a clearer picture
what we're dealing with,

07:15.262 --> 07:16.926
we'll be able to make a decision then.

07:17.265 --> 07:19.625
Alright, they found the wallet
in his room. Any money in it?

07:19.657 --> 07:21.221
Cash and cards still there.

07:21.246 --> 07:23.522
That rules out a smash and grab.

07:23.547 --> 07:26.469
Maybe it was a "time's up" type of deal,

07:26.577 --> 07:29.646
- Millwood style.
- One of his women did this?

07:29.691 --> 07:32.159
If not a woman, could be her husband.

07:32.403 --> 07:33.840
Good point.

07:33.865 --> 07:37.252
You turn over every stone,
a crab is bound to crawl out.

07:39.240 --> 07:41.275
We got this.

07:51.037 --> 07:53.469
Teddie, hey. I was
just about to call you.

07:53.640 --> 07:55.672
Great job on the Lovand case, Joanna.

07:55.697 --> 07:57.601
You really turned it around.

07:57.626 --> 07:59.157
They've reached out for a sit-down,

07:59.182 --> 08:01.754
and I think that they are
scared to go to trial now

08:01.779 --> 08:04.397
- because of you.
- My father died.

08:06.971 --> 08:08.845
My God!

08:09.062 --> 08:11.543
- Joanna, I'm so sorry.
- Thank you.

08:11.591 --> 08:13.099
I...

08:13.289 --> 08:16.106
I have a couple of things I have
to deal with here in Millwood,

08:16.131 --> 08:17.871
- and...
- Yes, of course!

08:17.948 --> 08:19.475
And then I will be back to work.

08:19.558 --> 08:22.154
No, don't worry about it.
I will take care of Lovand

08:22.179 --> 08:24.261
and Noah and anything
else that comes up.

08:24.320 --> 08:26.322
You just take as much time as you need.

08:26.424 --> 08:30.093
- No, I wanna be back.
- I insist.

08:30.325 --> 08:32.735
No, this should not take long.

08:32.909 --> 08:35.409
I will be back in a day or two.

08:44.043 --> 08:46.576
It wasn't self-defense
if he had his back turned.

08:58.360 --> 09:00.924
- Ms. Hanley.
- It's Chang.

09:01.221 --> 09:02.625
Great.

09:02.726 --> 09:05.562
I'm sorry for your loss.

09:05.663 --> 09:09.232
I appreciate you coming down.
Right this way, please.

09:10.156 --> 09:12.268
Your father had a lot of enemies.

09:12.624 --> 09:14.170
You're sure this was homicide?

09:14.271 --> 09:16.105
It's certainly pointing that way.

09:16.207 --> 09:18.034
How did he die?

09:18.742 --> 09:20.643
Looks like blunt-force trauma.

09:21.005 --> 09:22.496
He took a blow to the back of the head.

09:22.520 --> 09:25.170
- With what?
- A bottle of booze.

09:25.380 --> 09:27.214
A big one.

09:29.220 --> 09:31.354
- I'm sorry, do you need a minute?
- No, I'm good.

09:31.567 --> 09:33.046
Was he in pain?

09:33.091 --> 09:35.992
Single blow to the head, happened fast.

09:38.780 --> 09:40.523
Did he tell you he was gonna be in town

09:40.548 --> 09:42.515
or what he was doing here?

09:44.802 --> 09:46.703
Any idea who might
have done this to him?

09:46.804 --> 09:48.838
Like you said, throw
a stone in this town

09:48.863 --> 09:51.498
and you'll hit someone
with a grudge against him.

09:51.675 --> 09:53.576
We're gonna need a list.

09:56.714 --> 09:58.548
Ben Matheson.

09:58.949 --> 10:00.608
My father threw him under the bus

10:00.633 --> 10:04.303
during the Matheson Steel case.
He lost everything.

10:05.157 --> 10:07.877
But I can't imagine him
doing something like this.

10:08.802 --> 10:11.535
That lawsuit destroyed my life.

10:12.086 --> 10:14.087
Do I blame Hanley for that?

10:15.613 --> 10:17.786
Sure, maybe.

10:18.435 --> 10:20.788
You think I had something
to do with this?

10:21.963 --> 10:24.762
Where were you last night
between 8 and midnight?

10:24.810 --> 10:27.877
I was at The Boot all night.

10:28.421 --> 10:29.879
A lot of people saw me.

10:30.263 --> 10:31.981
I can get you a list

10:32.082 --> 10:35.198
or you could just talk to
Lou, I was sitting at the bar.

10:37.199 --> 10:39.600
I know you think I had
something to do with this.

10:40.289 --> 10:42.424
What do you mean by that?

10:42.946 --> 10:44.561
Because I was at the motel.

10:44.662 --> 10:46.891
A lot of people were
staying at the motel, Shane.

10:46.961 --> 10:49.396
But were a lot of people
supposed to stay in that room?

10:50.139 --> 10:51.726
What are you talking about?

10:55.940 --> 10:58.717
Look, I know I don't exactly
have a squeaky-clean record,

10:58.837 --> 11:01.606
and it's no secret that
the guy was a douche,

11:02.306 --> 11:03.707
but I didn't do it.

11:03.816 --> 11:06.052
We're not saying you did, son.

11:06.338 --> 11:09.289
Yeah. It's like I told
the officer last night.

11:09.987 --> 11:11.843
I didn't see or hear anything.

11:13.106 --> 11:14.712
There's no need to worry.

11:15.132 --> 11:18.706
Sorry, I just get nervous
talking to police.

11:19.208 --> 11:20.763
Of course.

11:21.167 --> 11:22.651
You know who doesn't?

11:22.722 --> 11:24.076
Bad guys.

11:27.890 --> 11:30.139
We just want to know what
you saw last night, Taylor.

11:30.240 --> 11:32.513
I didn't see anything.

11:32.632 --> 11:34.611
I did hear an argument though.

11:34.712 --> 11:36.912
- Between?
- A man,

11:36.937 --> 11:39.470
I guess that was David
Hanley, and some woman.

11:39.573 --> 11:41.186
You hear what was being said?

11:41.266 --> 11:43.791
- No.
- Did you hear anything else?

11:43.887 --> 11:45.720
Anything more after the argument?

11:45.745 --> 11:48.248
- Any type of struggle?
- No. Sorry. It all died down

11:48.312 --> 11:50.280
by the time the pizza guy came.

11:51.568 --> 11:53.262
Any idea what time that was?

11:53.364 --> 11:56.231
I don't know, 9-ish?

11:56.366 --> 11:58.568
Can you talk about the
women in your father's life?

12:00.804 --> 12:02.284
I'd rather not.

12:02.356 --> 12:04.614
It's no secret your father
was a fan of the ladies.

12:04.639 --> 12:08.042
- You can't have been oblivious to that.
- I don't know what to tell you.

12:12.587 --> 12:13.883
We just want to talk to you

12:13.908 --> 12:15.032
about your,

12:15.057 --> 12:17.492
relationship with David Hanley.

12:17.629 --> 12:19.550
It was a lifetime ago.

12:21.091 --> 12:24.817
- You knew he was in town?
- I'm the mayor, not a psychic.

12:25.780 --> 12:27.042
Can your office handle

12:27.067 --> 12:28.695
- this investigation?
- 100%.

12:28.720 --> 12:30.990
- Because if this goes sideways.
- It's not gonna happen.

12:31.035 --> 12:33.350
And you're sure you shouldn't
bring in some backup on this?

12:33.374 --> 12:36.780
Hey, I'm the one asking
the questions here, Mayor.

12:40.590 --> 12:42.524
Where were you last night?

12:42.605 --> 12:45.281
I was hosting a fundraiser
at the Booster Club.

12:45.647 --> 12:47.450
Anybody see you there?

12:47.830 --> 12:49.528
Yeah.

12:49.615 --> 12:53.163
The 55 people I delivered a speech to.

12:55.771 --> 12:57.661
Last time you were in town,
didn't someone give you

12:57.685 --> 12:59.264
a big old shiner?

12:59.486 --> 13:00.740
Amy Carr.

13:00.765 --> 13:03.257
And why would she haul off and do that?

13:03.659 --> 13:06.494
She was upset about what
happened with her sister.

13:06.761 --> 13:08.207
- Erin?
- Yeah.

13:08.232 --> 13:10.825
- What did you do to Erin?
- Nothing.

13:12.443 --> 13:14.143
It was a message.

13:14.435 --> 13:16.270
For your father?

13:18.382 --> 13:21.118
- Where were you last night?
- I was home

13:21.143 --> 13:22.429
watching reruns

13:22.454 --> 13:24.884
of Say Yes to the Dress.
I am guilty of that.

13:24.963 --> 13:27.823
- Were you alone?
- Yeah.

13:28.358 --> 13:31.027
What were you doing at Gerrilynn
Spence's place last week?

13:31.128 --> 13:33.663
I was working. She asked
me to appraise her house.

13:34.402 --> 13:35.681
She wanted to sell?

13:35.759 --> 13:37.467
That's right.

13:37.663 --> 13:39.564
But the house isn't listed.

13:39.724 --> 13:41.565
I guess she changed her mind.

13:41.590 --> 13:43.522
Or maybe you two cooked
up a different plan.

13:43.547 --> 13:45.010
I don't know what you're talking about.

13:45.034 --> 13:46.781
Two ex-girlfriends of David Hanley...

13:46.806 --> 13:49.790
Well we weren't conspiring if
that's where this is going.

13:49.815 --> 13:52.695
We only want to determine
what happened last night.

13:53.582 --> 13:56.217
I'm sorry. I can't help you with that.

13:57.239 --> 13:59.021
Where do you think you're going?

13:59.601 --> 14:01.224
Am I under arrest?

14:01.939 --> 14:03.118
No, Ma'am.

14:03.201 --> 14:04.894
Well then, you can't keep me here.

14:05.052 --> 14:07.997
You let me know when you
catch whoever did this.

14:08.153 --> 14:10.421
I'd like to send them a gift basket.

14:16.270 --> 14:18.358
Of course I was angry,
but I had other recourse.

14:18.387 --> 14:20.821
- We filed a civil suit.
- Wow!

14:20.948 --> 14:24.508
Now, those are some fancy words.
Your lawyer teach you those?

14:25.294 --> 14:28.115
A lot of people saw that
stunt you pulled at The Boot.

14:28.179 --> 14:30.353
I argued with him; I didn't kill him.

14:30.454 --> 14:32.088
- But you were angry.
- Yes.

14:32.189 --> 14:34.592
- I already told you that.
- You threw a glass at his head.

14:34.659 --> 14:37.546
Yeah. A couple of
tables actually cheered.

14:37.816 --> 14:39.517
But you missed.

14:40.342 --> 14:43.019
Maybe you went back to the
motel to finish the job?

14:43.289 --> 14:45.014
I didn't kill him.

14:45.071 --> 14:46.478
We have and eyewitness account

14:46.503 --> 14:48.295
of an Indigenous woman
fleeing the scene.

14:48.320 --> 14:50.260
That plus broken glass at the motel.

14:50.285 --> 14:51.904
Seems like we have a running theme here.

14:51.929 --> 14:54.162
Look, we got into it at the bar,

14:54.187 --> 14:56.739
and that's the last time I saw him, OK?
I swear.

14:56.764 --> 14:59.048
- I was working all night!
- You didn't take a break then?

14:59.149 --> 15:01.317
Yes. No.

15:01.460 --> 15:03.391
- I took my break.
- How long?

15:03.914 --> 15:06.589
I don't know, 10 minutes maybe.

15:07.299 --> 15:09.334
You sure you didn't stretch it a bit?

15:09.388 --> 15:12.290
- Head over to the motel?
- No!

15:12.568 --> 15:14.630
Look...

15:15.904 --> 15:17.355
I'm sure you didn't go there

15:17.380 --> 15:18.758
with the intention of killing him.

15:18.836 --> 15:20.734
I didn't go there, period.

15:20.759 --> 15:22.323
You just wanted to finish the argument

15:22.348 --> 15:24.142
you started at The Boot,
things got out of hand.

15:24.166 --> 15:25.712
- It happens.
- You know what?

15:25.737 --> 15:27.067
I don't have anything more to say.

15:27.091 --> 15:30.093
SIT DOWN, Ms. Spence!

15:32.457 --> 15:34.158
Sit down!

15:37.004 --> 15:39.856
When are you people
gonna learn some respect?

15:45.097 --> 15:47.281
I want to talk to my lawyer.

15:48.031 --> 15:50.442
You hear me?! I want
to talk to my lawyer!

15:50.775 --> 15:53.825
I'm detaining you in connection
with the murder of David Hanley.

15:53.921 --> 15:55.555
What?

16:04.377 --> 16:06.782
- Luna.
- Where's Mom?

16:06.884 --> 16:09.895
Um...

16:13.800 --> 16:15.701
David Hanley died last night.

16:16.118 --> 16:17.627
He was murdered.

16:18.136 --> 16:20.075
Your mom's being held for questioning.

16:20.169 --> 16:22.053
- She didn't do it.
- I know.

16:22.078 --> 16:23.934
- I need to see her...
- No, no. Hey, hey,

16:23.959 --> 16:25.592
you can't go back there right now.

16:25.669 --> 16:28.092
I'm telling you, she didn't do it.

16:28.249 --> 16:30.584
She didn't do it.

16:30.836 --> 16:32.837
She didn't do it!

16:45.343 --> 16:47.567
They strip searched me, Billy,

16:47.663 --> 16:50.608
and they took all sorts of pictures.

16:50.728 --> 16:52.270
It's supposed to be for
your own protection.

16:52.294 --> 16:55.962
- Well, it sure doesn't feel that way.
- In case of police brutality.

16:58.979 --> 17:00.937
You sit tight.

17:01.263 --> 17:03.188
Don't say a word.

17:03.642 --> 17:04.983
They haven't charged you with anything;

17:05.007 --> 17:06.582
It's clear they don't have a case.

17:09.050 --> 17:12.178
Can you call Luna and
explain what's going on?

17:13.306 --> 17:16.213
She knows. She's right outside.

17:17.710 --> 17:19.810
Do you want me to bring her in?

17:19.951 --> 17:21.776
No. I don't...

17:21.926 --> 17:24.444
I don't want her to see me like this.

17:31.250 --> 17:33.956
He's cutting corners,
jumping to conclusions.

17:33.989 --> 17:35.214
He's dangerous.

17:35.239 --> 17:37.413
If you want me to stick my
neck out for you, I need more.

17:37.437 --> 17:39.804
A man was murdered, and a
potentially innocent woman

17:39.829 --> 17:42.027
may be blamed for it,
an Indigenous woman.

17:42.093 --> 17:43.616
I know the history of this town.

17:43.673 --> 17:46.570
With all due respect, my
history and your history

17:46.623 --> 17:48.421
in this town are pretty
different, Mayor.

17:48.464 --> 17:51.003
We're on the same team, Owen.

17:51.544 --> 17:53.981
Just bring me something I can use.

18:12.470 --> 18:13.971
Joanna!

18:14.536 --> 18:16.304
Joanna.

18:20.652 --> 18:22.228
What are you doing here?

18:22.332 --> 18:25.074
I-I drove in with
Taylor this morning.

18:25.099 --> 18:28.670
My mom, she didn't
do what they're saying.

18:28.723 --> 18:30.601
They're talking to a lot of people,

18:30.626 --> 18:34.089
- I'm sure it's just a formality.
- She didn't kill him!

18:34.114 --> 18:36.797
- Hey, hey.
- Are they done? Can I see her?

18:36.822 --> 18:39.013
No, not yet. Luna, I talked to her.

18:39.255 --> 18:41.156
It's gonna be OK. I'm
gonna do everything I can

18:41.181 --> 18:42.756
- to get her out of here.
- I want to see her.

18:42.780 --> 18:44.301
No, no, not right now.

18:44.326 --> 18:46.461
She asked that you head out to my place.

18:46.486 --> 18:47.868
Just lay low for a bit.

18:47.893 --> 18:50.661
OK? I'll call you the
second we know anything.

18:50.757 --> 18:53.826
OK. But you'll take care of her, right?

18:54.277 --> 18:56.445
You have my word.

19:07.303 --> 19:08.529
How did my father react

19:08.554 --> 19:10.722
to Gerrilynn's civil suit against him?

19:11.469 --> 19:13.392
You know I can't discuss
the case with you.

19:13.417 --> 19:16.061
- Why not? He's dead, Billy.
- He's not my client.

19:16.243 --> 19:19.277
She has motive. She
probably had opportunity.

19:19.412 --> 19:22.581
Joanna, a lot of people in Millwood
had motive and opportunity.

19:22.623 --> 19:25.123
Yes, but how many of those people
pressed charges against him

19:25.148 --> 19:26.442
and had those charges thrown out?

19:26.466 --> 19:27.703
That would make me pretty angry.

19:27.727 --> 19:30.902
You know her... you
can't think she did this.

19:31.074 --> 19:33.071
I don't know what to think.

19:34.904 --> 19:36.993
She didn't do it.

19:41.949 --> 19:45.151
Hey. The coroner's report came back.

19:47.073 --> 19:48.674
Give me the CliffsNotes version.

19:48.728 --> 19:50.667
No defensive wounds

19:50.739 --> 19:52.266
other than the head trauma.

19:52.291 --> 19:54.049
There's no other signs of a struggle.

19:54.341 --> 19:55.890
Pulled a bunch of prints
off the murder weapon.

19:55.914 --> 19:56.979
They're running those.

19:57.004 --> 19:59.185
And, interestingly, they found

19:59.210 --> 20:01.185
skin underneath his fingernails.

20:01.259 --> 20:03.130
They're running the DNA.

20:03.383 --> 20:06.589
So, it's good news.
Exonerates Gerrilynn.

20:07.906 --> 20:09.759
How do you figure?

20:10.063 --> 20:12.462
You saw the pictures, she
doesn't have a mark on her.

20:12.557 --> 20:15.352
Well, no visible signs
of struggle, but...

20:16.178 --> 20:17.960
that skin could be from the last woman

20:17.985 --> 20:19.460
that Hanley had sex with.

20:19.670 --> 20:21.892
What? So you're saying Gerrilynn

20:21.917 --> 20:23.417
went over and killed him

20:23.442 --> 20:25.394
after some other woman had sex with him?

20:25.419 --> 20:28.025
No, I'm saying I don't know
what happened in that motel.

20:28.050 --> 20:30.018
And neither do you, Owen.

20:30.325 --> 20:32.693
I'm keeping her until the DNA is back.

20:43.409 --> 20:45.944
Hi. You've reached Molly.
You know what to do.

20:49.849 --> 20:51.650
Hey, it's me.

20:52.286 --> 20:54.320
Again.

20:59.276 --> 21:01.205
It says here Billy Crawford's
the lawyer on record...

21:01.229 --> 21:02.753
Obviously. I'm his partner

21:02.778 --> 21:05.166
and I want to speak to our client now!

21:15.240 --> 21:17.241
I want to know what
happened to my father.

21:17.271 --> 21:19.339
Just tell me the truth, and I'll leave.

21:19.615 --> 21:21.169
Joanna, you...

21:21.641 --> 21:24.176
you... you have to believe
I could never... I...

21:26.218 --> 21:28.352
I would never.

21:30.795 --> 21:33.243
He was your dad, and you loved him.

21:34.115 --> 21:36.416
I loved him too...

21:36.620 --> 21:38.478
once.

21:45.775 --> 21:47.413
You don't say a word to anyone

21:47.438 --> 21:49.182
without Billy here, got it?

21:51.270 --> 21:54.082
OK... What are you gonna do?

21:54.216 --> 21:57.617
I'm gonna find out who did this
and help get you out of here.

22:58.504 --> 23:01.455
- Who are you?
- Shane?!

23:01.876 --> 23:03.727
It's-it's me, Taylor.

23:03.807 --> 23:05.753
Taylor Matheson?

23:07.847 --> 23:10.125
You shouldn't be sneaking around
out here, I could have hurt you.

23:10.149 --> 23:13.098
I'm sorry. I was just
looking for my yearbook.

23:13.376 --> 23:15.811
Being home has made
me kind of nostalgic.

23:16.210 --> 23:17.760
Billy told me no one was here.

23:17.823 --> 23:20.349
Why is your stuff in
my brother's garage?

23:21.901 --> 23:24.869
You probably heard that my
parents were splitting up.

23:25.122 --> 23:27.079
No...

23:27.285 --> 23:29.959
No, I didn't. I'm so sorry.

23:30.319 --> 23:32.226
That sucks!

23:32.408 --> 23:34.189
Yeah, it does.

23:34.938 --> 23:37.506
Billy was nice enough to
let me keep my stuff here.

23:37.694 --> 23:39.490
Bad time to show up in town.

23:39.555 --> 23:41.268
What with the murder and everything.

23:41.379 --> 23:43.639
I know. That's crazy, right?

23:43.740 --> 23:45.320
I was supposed to stay in that room.

23:45.448 --> 23:48.386
- What? What do you mean?
- Last night,

23:48.806 --> 23:51.480
I asked for that room;
They said it was taken.

23:51.581 --> 23:53.638
That's super creepy.

23:56.891 --> 24:00.079
Stay here. Let me check this out.

24:07.506 --> 24:09.140
Luna!

24:12.115 --> 24:15.451
- Are you OK?
- Tay, I-I...

24:15.577 --> 24:17.789
I'm sorry. Stupid, stupid question.

24:20.358 --> 24:22.411
- You good?
- Yeah, we're good.

24:22.821 --> 24:24.313
Watch your backs out there?

24:24.350 --> 24:26.351
- Who's that?
- That's Billy's brother.

24:26.397 --> 24:28.265
Come on, let's get you inside.

24:28.302 --> 24:30.203
Taylor... Taylor, my dad...

24:30.344 --> 24:32.301
- I know.
- My mom, they're holding her

24:32.326 --> 24:33.927
- for questioning.
- What?!

24:33.952 --> 24:36.285
They think she's somehow connected.

24:37.414 --> 24:39.369
No, there's no way she did it.

24:39.394 --> 24:41.012
Sometimes, you don't know, Luna,

24:41.037 --> 24:42.484
what people are capable of.

24:42.548 --> 24:45.010
- What are you saying?
- Nothing. I'm not...

24:45.035 --> 24:47.973
I just... I didn't believe

24:47.998 --> 24:50.776
that my dad would poison
the town, but he did.

24:51.364 --> 24:52.736
I'm sorry, Luna.

24:52.761 --> 24:55.482
This isn't coming out the
way that I want it to.

24:55.507 --> 24:57.402
I'm just nervous.

24:59.064 --> 25:01.360
Being home, it's been a lot.

25:01.590 --> 25:03.700
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have
bailed on you the other night.

25:03.724 --> 25:05.636
No, it's OK.

25:06.479 --> 25:08.557
I had to go down to the police station

25:08.650 --> 25:10.474
to answer some questions
about what I heard

25:10.499 --> 25:11.847
at the motel last night.

25:11.975 --> 25:13.691
What did you hear?

25:13.826 --> 25:15.725
An argument between him and some woman.

25:15.750 --> 25:18.018
- Did you hear what they said?
- No. No.

25:18.090 --> 25:20.687
It was muffled. Not much help I guess.

26:10.712 --> 26:12.338
Check 1-0-4.

27:22.988 --> 27:25.626
You jeopardize this entire
investigation, you realize that?

27:25.651 --> 27:28.607
Nobody saw me. What was
in the coroner's report?

27:28.652 --> 27:31.130
No way.

27:35.477 --> 27:37.702
Doesn't that look like
fresh blood to you?

27:38.447 --> 27:39.704
And your guys missed it.

27:39.805 --> 27:41.870
Things are being missed, Owen.

27:41.963 --> 27:44.431
This investigation is amateur hour.

27:44.955 --> 27:47.245
The coroner found DNA under his nails.

27:47.822 --> 27:50.713
Whoever killed him likely
got scratched in the process.

27:50.880 --> 27:52.372
And cut.

27:52.451 --> 27:55.152
- You have to test that blood.
- We will.

27:55.328 --> 27:57.299
Please tell me you didn't
touch anything in here.

27:57.410 --> 28:00.758
Don't worry, I'm not nearly
as sloppy as the Millwood PD.

28:02.944 --> 28:05.579
How did you find that down there?

28:07.364 --> 28:12.003
My father would never
use motel towels. Ever.

28:12.104 --> 28:14.255
He always brought his own.

28:14.889 --> 28:17.723
Check his stuff. He
has a monogrammed set.

28:18.425 --> 28:21.260
And there is one towel missing.

28:21.489 --> 28:24.391
Someone was bleeding and left
with one of those towels.

28:24.428 --> 28:27.630
- This is huge, Joanna.
- I know.

28:27.755 --> 28:29.823
You have to get Mercer
off this investigation.

28:29.848 --> 28:31.782
He's not experienced enough.

28:32.157 --> 28:34.673
We have to find who did this.

28:34.840 --> 28:36.582
We will.

28:36.663 --> 28:38.662
Now why don't you stick
to your job, counselor,

28:38.687 --> 28:40.217
and let me do mine.

28:45.716 --> 28:48.510
I have been calling you so
much I feel like a stalker.

28:48.542 --> 28:49.778
Don't say that.

28:49.819 --> 28:51.976
It's my fault. I've been...

28:52.296 --> 28:53.906
I've been stupid.

28:53.971 --> 28:55.853
No, you haven't.

28:56.883 --> 28:59.851
We're both just trying
to figure stuff out.

29:00.715 --> 29:02.553
I can't believe he's dead.

29:03.083 --> 29:04.555
Are you OK?

29:04.656 --> 29:06.857
I don't really know

29:06.882 --> 29:08.620
how I am supposed to feel.

29:08.689 --> 29:11.525
I'll jump on a bus. I can
be there in a few hours, OK?

29:11.550 --> 29:12.773
No, don't.

29:12.798 --> 29:14.533
I just... I-I want to get out of here,

29:14.558 --> 29:17.493
but I need to make sure
that my mom's OK first.

29:17.956 --> 29:20.014
Yeah, of course.

29:20.188 --> 29:22.707
So, I'll call you when I know more.

29:23.177 --> 29:24.542
Yeah.

29:25.113 --> 29:28.546
I'm really glad I
finally got ahold of you.

29:28.887 --> 29:30.372
Me too.

29:30.419 --> 29:32.399
I'm sorry I haven't been around more.

29:32.479 --> 29:34.780
That stops now, OK?

29:35.120 --> 29:37.021
I love you, Lu.

29:37.834 --> 29:39.323
I love you too.

29:51.903 --> 29:54.372
- Thanks for coming.
- Of course.

29:59.340 --> 30:01.879
I'm sorry about how I was earlier.

30:02.044 --> 30:04.615
Hey, let's not start apologizing.

30:04.798 --> 30:06.617
It'll set a bad precedent.

30:07.752 --> 30:09.286
I believe Gerrilynn's innocent.

30:09.551 --> 30:11.288
I found new evidence at the crime scene.

30:11.466 --> 30:12.923
You broke into the crime scene?

30:12.948 --> 30:14.685
- Billy, keep your voice down.
- What were you thinking?

30:14.709 --> 30:16.176
I was trying to help your client.

30:16.201 --> 30:18.169
She doesn't need that kind of help.

30:18.523 --> 30:21.810
Her alibi checks out, and I have this.

30:31.970 --> 30:34.238
- He tried to pay her off.
- Yeah.

30:35.312 --> 30:36.927
So why wouldn't she cash it first?

30:36.952 --> 30:38.195
Jesus!

30:38.220 --> 30:40.228
I'd want that kind of money
for a getaway, wouldn't you?

30:40.252 --> 30:42.253
- Yeah, definitely.
- Hey.

30:42.792 --> 30:45.072
Can we talk about the bit where
you broke into a crime scene?

30:45.096 --> 30:46.636
Billy...

30:49.483 --> 30:51.484
I just think you might be
a little close to this.

30:51.712 --> 30:53.412
No, I'm fine.

30:53.654 --> 30:56.033
Come on, let's go get your client out.

30:58.321 --> 31:01.284
She's not going anywhere
until the DNA comes back.

31:03.801 --> 31:06.721
That's what David Hanley offered
Gerrilynn to drop the civil suit.

31:06.832 --> 31:08.979
This is nothing to prove
she didn't kill him.

31:09.835 --> 31:11.353
So why didn't she cash it?

31:11.440 --> 31:14.084
I don't know, maybe she
was insulted by the offer.

31:14.186 --> 31:15.796
It's gonna be hard to prove to a jury

31:15.821 --> 31:18.909
that anyone around here would be
insulted by half a million dollars.

31:19.146 --> 31:21.054
Plus, I have two coworkers

31:21.141 --> 31:22.993
willing to give sworn
statements that Gerrilynn

31:23.018 --> 31:25.232
took one 10-minute break, all night.

31:25.366 --> 31:27.667
Not nearly enough time
to get to the motel

31:27.692 --> 31:29.693
and to kill him and then get back.

31:30.101 --> 31:32.000
Without a scratch on her, I might add.

31:32.082 --> 31:34.283
No motive, no opportunity,

31:34.308 --> 31:36.275
no defensive wounds.

31:39.729 --> 31:42.264
Tell your client not to leave town.

31:45.750 --> 31:47.447
You should probably lay low for a bit.

31:47.491 --> 31:49.416
Mercer's gunning for you.

31:53.337 --> 31:55.971
- Thank you.
- You got it.

32:07.827 --> 32:10.128
Thanks for helping me.

32:11.747 --> 32:14.311
And again, I just want to say I'm sorry.

32:17.990 --> 32:20.601
Come on, let's get you home.

32:27.325 --> 32:28.959
It's been a long day.

32:29.032 --> 32:32.235
Diane wants to meet us at The Boot.
You up for that?

32:32.376 --> 32:34.677
I could really use a drink.

32:35.191 --> 32:36.836
Have you notified everyone you need to?

32:36.861 --> 32:38.786
- Do you need me to call anyone?
- I don't think so.

32:38.810 --> 32:40.910
I spoke to the partners at CTS,

32:40.939 --> 32:42.706
and, um...

32:43.000 --> 32:44.708
I called my mom.

32:45.177 --> 32:47.011
Honey, that must have been...

32:47.036 --> 32:48.416
Yeah.

32:50.442 --> 32:52.410
Yeah, complicated.

32:54.152 --> 32:57.208
I know how strained things
were between you and your dad.

32:57.233 --> 32:59.789
Strained is an understatement.

32:59.814 --> 33:02.236
Get back to me as soon as you
get the results. Thank you.

33:02.283 --> 33:04.517
Nothing was ever easy with him.
I mean, even now,

33:04.542 --> 33:07.161
I want to just bury him,
and I can't even do that.

33:07.198 --> 33:10.166
Sorry. That was the police.

33:10.681 --> 33:12.882
Still no word on the forensic results.

33:12.907 --> 33:14.501
I would feel a hell of a lot better

33:14.526 --> 33:16.207
if Mercer wasn't in
charge of this thing.

33:16.237 --> 33:19.773
- I think we all would.
- It's out of our control.

33:20.450 --> 33:22.164
We need to focus on the facts.

33:22.189 --> 33:24.019
When I spoke to Taylor
about her statement,

33:24.044 --> 33:25.329
she said she had no idea

33:25.354 --> 33:27.718
the argument she heard
even involved your father.

33:28.761 --> 33:30.554
Wait, Taylor was a witness?

33:30.655 --> 33:32.543
Yeah, she was staying at the motel.

33:32.660 --> 33:34.761
She came in last night?

33:34.878 --> 33:36.946
As far as I know.

33:37.892 --> 33:39.330
I have to go. Um,

33:39.431 --> 33:41.043
- thanks for the drink.
- Wait.

33:41.076 --> 33:43.211
What? Where are you going?

33:58.253 --> 34:00.388
Why did you lie to me?

34:02.454 --> 34:03.754
What?

34:04.876 --> 34:07.644
You told me that you and
Taylor came in this morning,

34:08.159 --> 34:10.159
but you and I both know
she was here last night.

34:27.804 --> 34:30.327
He told me to go home, and I
followed him into the room.

34:30.351 --> 34:32.591
We started fighting. And
then when he threatened

34:32.616 --> 34:34.466
to call the cops,
I grabbed for his phone

34:34.491 --> 34:36.699
- and that's how I got these...
- But then you left?

34:36.826 --> 34:39.179
- Yes.
- And you never went back?

34:39.266 --> 34:41.228
No. I told you.

34:41.463 --> 34:45.264
OK. So you got in a fight with him,

34:45.426 --> 34:49.279
left and then an hour or so later,

34:49.304 --> 34:51.205
someone else killed him?

34:51.960 --> 34:53.474
Why do you say it like that?

34:53.498 --> 34:56.583
- Like what?
- Like you don't believe me.

34:56.612 --> 34:58.402
Luna, you lied to me.

34:58.455 --> 35:00.289
Because he's your dad!

35:00.802 --> 35:02.145
I didn't want you to think

35:02.170 --> 35:04.620
that I had anything to do
with what happened to him.

35:04.693 --> 35:06.073
Mercer told me

35:06.098 --> 35:07.384
that they have a witness that saw

35:07.408 --> 35:08.946
an indigenous woman leave the room,

35:08.987 --> 35:12.346
so it's only a matter of time before
they piece two and two together.

35:15.311 --> 35:17.312
Where are you gonna go?

35:19.555 --> 35:21.857
I don't know. South?

35:22.914 --> 35:26.325
It'll look worse for you if you run.

35:27.312 --> 35:29.377
You have to go to the
police and tell them

35:29.402 --> 35:31.637
what you just told me,
explain exactly what happened.

35:31.755 --> 35:34.119
No. See, you're acting like she's you.

35:34.182 --> 35:35.478
The rules are different for us.

35:35.503 --> 35:37.232
If she goes in there,
she's not coming out.

35:37.273 --> 35:40.171
If she runs, she will never stop.

35:41.006 --> 35:42.898
You have to get out in front
of this because you know

35:42.922 --> 35:44.622
when that DNA comes back,

35:44.647 --> 35:46.715
it's gonna place her at the scene.

35:50.279 --> 35:52.100
Luna,

35:52.424 --> 35:54.597
I can protect you.

35:59.324 --> 36:01.409
Can I sleep on it?

36:01.633 --> 36:03.427
Of course, baby.

36:03.734 --> 36:05.779
The decision is yours.

36:13.892 --> 36:15.356
No.

36:15.870 --> 36:17.646
I'll make the couch.

36:49.196 --> 36:50.837
Is Luna with you?

36:51.960 --> 36:54.896
- No, she isn't.
- Then where the hell is she?

36:55.370 --> 36:57.137
Dammit!

37:10.588 --> 37:12.921
- Sam.
- There we go.

37:14.246 --> 37:16.637
I want to thank you for all
the work you've done so far...

37:16.702 --> 37:17.842
Don't patronize me!

37:17.867 --> 37:19.479
I understand it's a
high-profile case, Alison...

37:19.503 --> 37:20.671
Sam,

37:20.696 --> 37:23.148
blood that wasn't the victim's
was missed at the crime scene.

37:23.225 --> 37:24.464
How can you possibly know that?

37:24.488 --> 37:27.075
It's not your concern. I want
the RCMP brought in on this.

37:27.100 --> 37:28.878
I already told you that was unnecessary!

37:28.903 --> 37:31.805
And I'm telling you this town can't
handle any more negative press.

37:31.888 --> 37:33.883
Look, this is my investigation to run!

37:33.925 --> 37:35.926
For now.

37:36.495 --> 37:38.562
You can be replaced.

37:47.360 --> 37:49.122
Hey, everything OK in here?

37:49.206 --> 37:51.007
She thinks she can come in here,

37:51.172 --> 37:53.574
threaten me, threaten my job?

37:53.674 --> 37:56.155
Well, let me tell you something,
that door swings both ways.

37:56.219 --> 37:58.459
- Now is not the time to panic.
- No, no, no, no,

37:58.560 --> 38:01.628
I don't panic. I close cases.

38:46.608 --> 38:48.529
Luna?

38:56.560 --> 38:58.906
I'm ready to go to the station
and tell them what happened.

38:59.057 --> 39:01.222
- You're sure, baby?
- Yeah.

39:01.617 --> 39:04.018
You're making the right decision.

39:09.403 --> 39:10.609
Luna Spence...

39:10.634 --> 39:11.957
We were just going to come
down to the station...

39:11.981 --> 39:13.945
You're under arrest for
the murder of David Hanley.

39:13.969 --> 39:16.070
Luna is a witness. You
don't need to cuff her!

39:16.103 --> 39:18.244
- No, no, no, no!
- Gerrilynn. Gerrilynn.

39:18.647 --> 39:20.548
- Are you insane?! No!
- Shh, shh, shh.

39:20.609 --> 39:22.843
- We'll get out of there, OK?
- What are you doing?!

39:22.952 --> 39:25.258
- Just relax.
- You're gonna be OK.

39:25.520 --> 39:27.381
- Get off of me!
- Owen, I've got her!

39:27.406 --> 39:28.740
No!

39:28.917 --> 39:30.571
No! No.

40:44.982 --> 40:48.939
- She has the right to counsel.
- You can't keep us out.

40:49.050 --> 40:51.919
I'll call you when she's been processed.

40:52.560 --> 40:55.656
Hi. You've reached Molly.
You know what to do.

40:56.192 --> 40:58.223
Hey, it's... it's me.

40:58.445 --> 41:00.412
It's Luna. Umm...

41:02.612 --> 41:05.800
I... I accidentally
got your car impounded.

41:06.266 --> 41:09.775
Maybe Taylor can get
it and drive it back.

41:11.377 --> 41:12.829
Umm...

41:13.357 --> 41:15.391
they think I did it, Molls.

41:17.404 --> 41:20.255
They...

41:21.033 --> 41:23.884
They think I killed him, but I didn't.

41:24.302 --> 41:27.104
I swear, I swear I didn't do it.

41:29.205 --> 41:32.560
I just really, really
need to hear your voice.

41:50.135 --> 41:53.563
I just really, really
need to hear your voice.

41:54.517 --> 41:56.208
OK.

42:28.363 --> 42:29.950
We need a plan.

42:30.141 --> 42:32.742
The evidence is circumstantial,
but still it doesn't look good.

42:32.868 --> 42:35.470
Luna's gonna need the best
defense we can give her.

42:39.255 --> 42:41.256
Are you listening?

42:42.922 --> 42:45.086
I know my representing
her is an ethical breach,

42:45.111 --> 42:47.768
and I know we need a plan, but...

42:51.704 --> 42:53.939
But first, you have to listen to this.

42:57.960 --> 43:01.148
Guys like David get off with nothing,

43:01.647 --> 43:04.003
But not this time. I don't know how,

43:04.028 --> 43:06.049
but he's gonna pay for what he did.

43:06.074 --> 43:07.514
He's gonna get what's coming to him.

43:22.855 --> 43:24.672
