<i>Unit Christmas rations
must be picked up by 0900 hours.</i>

01:16.342 --> 01:21.473
<i>Armor group tree decoration team,
report to the Engineering Depot.</i>

01:25.952 --> 01:29.649
My son, will you turn off
that wretched puppet?

01:30.657 --> 01:32.625
Brush your teeth.

01:32.692 --> 01:35.354
Don't call him a puppet.

01:35.428 --> 01:36.895
I beg your pardon.

01:36.963 --> 01:39.591
Look, he's not a puppet.

01:39.666 --> 01:40.894
Howdy Doody's real.

01:40.967 --> 01:42.127
Well...
He's real.

01:42.202 --> 01:44.727
Mr. Deedee Doodoo will
have to say good night.

01:44.804 --> 01:46.567
Oh, no.

01:46.639 --> 01:49.164
And remember,
you have to be asleep

01:49.242 --> 01:51.733
when he comes
down the chimney.

01:52.779 --> 01:54.679
It's not even a chimney, Pop.

01:55.682 --> 01:56.979
He has his ways.

01:57.050 --> 01:58.381
Then I want to wait up.
Watch him do it.

01:58.451 --> 01:59.509
Nonsense.

01:59.586 --> 02:02.350
Okay.
I want a story then.

02:02.422 --> 02:03.787
Oh, no, no, no.
No stories tonight.

02:03.857 --> 02:05.950
Just one.
And then I'll go to bed.

02:06.025 --> 02:07.458
Right away.

02:07.527 --> 02:10.257
Then I'll brush my teeth,
I promise.

02:19.873 --> 02:23.809
"It is said that
at the dawn of time,

02:23.877 --> 02:30.783
"man, beast and all magical beings lived
together under Aiglin the Father Tree.

02:31.551 --> 02:35.487
"But man had been created
with a hole in his heart,

02:35.555 --> 02:41.050
"a hole that no possession,
power or knowledge could fill.

02:41.127 --> 02:43.357
"And in his infinite greed,

02:43.429 --> 02:48.594
"man dreamt of expanding his
dominion over the entire Earth.

03:03.216 --> 03:07.050
<i>" The blood of many an elf,</i>
<i>ogre and goblin</i>

03:07.120 --> 03:09.850
<i>was spilled in</i>
<i>their war with man.</i>

03:09.923 --> 03:13.324
<i>"And King Balor, the
one-armed king of Elfland,</i>

03:13.393 --> 03:17.124
<i>" watched the slaughter</i>
<i>in dread and despair.</i>

03:18.665 --> 03:22.101
<i>" But one day, the master</i>
<i>of the goblin blacksmiths</i>

03:22.168 --> 03:26.264
<i>" offered to build the king</i>
<i>a golden mechanical army,</i>

03:26.339 --> 03:28.705
<i>"seventy times 70 soldiers</i>

03:28.775 --> 03:32.711
<i>" that would never know hunger</i>
<i>and could not be stopped.</i>

03:32.779 --> 03:35.714
<i>" Prince Nuada begged</i>
<i>his father to agree.</i>

03:36.883 --> 03:39.408
<i>" 'Build me this army, '
<i>the king said.</i></i>

03:49.729 --> 03:52.721
<i>" So a magical crown</i>
<i>was forged</i>

03:52.799 --> 03:55.029
<i>" that would allow</i>
<i>those of royal blood</i>

03:55.101 --> 03:57.934
<i>" to command the Golden Army</i>
<i>if unchallenged.</i>

03:58.004 --> 04:02.134
<i>" 'I am King Balor,</i>
<i>leader of the Golden Army.</i>

04:02.208 --> 04:04.768
<i>" 'ls there anyone</i>
<i>who disputes my right? '</i>

04:04.844 --> 04:08.644
<i>"And in his throne room</i>
<i>no one challenged his word."</i>

04:09.582 --> 04:12.745
But, wait, what if someone
could challenge him?

04:12.819 --> 04:13.877
Would they have a fight?

04:13.953 --> 04:15.215
Well, most likely.

04:15.288 --> 04:16.482
A challenge must
be answered.

04:16.555 --> 04:18.649
But do you want to hear
the end of this story or not?

04:18.725 --> 04:19.817
Yes, please.

04:19.892 --> 04:20.950
Right.

04:21.027 --> 04:26.158
"So the world was changed, and
the next time the humans marched,

04:26.232 --> 04:29.861
<i>" they felt the earth</i>
<i>tremble beneath their feet</i>

04:29.936 --> 04:34.430
<i>" and saw the sky darken</i>
<i>with monstrous shapes.</i>

04:39.612 --> 04:46.279
<i>" The Golden Army had no
remorse, felt no loyalty or pain.</i>

04:50.089 --> 04:53.490
<i>"And King Balor's heart</i>
<i>grew heavy with regret.</i>

04:53.559 --> 04:58.826
<i>" So he called a truce and
divided the crown in three pieces,</i>

04:58.898 --> 05:02.561
<i>" one for the humans,</i>
<i>and two for himself.</i>

05:02.635 --> 05:05.900
<i>" In exchange, man
would keep to the cities</i>

05:05.972 --> 05:08.964
<i>" and the magical beings</i>
<i>would own the forests.</i>

05:09.042 --> 05:13.308
<i>" This truce would be honored by
their sons and the sons of their sons</i>

05:13.379 --> 05:15.176
<i>" until the end of time.</i>

05:16.416 --> 05:20.318
<i>" But Prince Nuada did not
believe in the promises of man.</i>

05:20.386 --> 05:23.355
<i>"And it is said that</i>
<i>he went into exile,</i>

05:23.456 --> 05:27.620
<i>" vowing to return the day
his people needed him most.</i>

05:28.227 --> 05:31.822
<i>" So the Golden</i>
<i>Army lay dormant,</i>

05:31.898 --> 05:35.425
<i>" locked inside the Earth,</i>
<i>waiting.</i>

05:37.337 --> 05:40.170
<i>"And there it is to this day,</i>

05:40.239 --> 05:44.039
"awaiting the day the crown
is made whole again.

05:44.110 --> 05:49.707
"Silent,
still and indestructible."

05:49.782 --> 05:53.411
Wow. What does it
mean "industrable"?

05:53.486 --> 05:54.714
Indestructible.

05:54.787 --> 05:55.947
Indestruct...

05:56.022 --> 05:57.182
It means no one
can destroy them.

05:57.256 --> 05:58.382
Wow.

05:58.458 --> 06:00.585
Go to sleep, my son.

06:00.660 --> 06:03.561
But it's just
a story, right, Pops?

06:03.629 --> 06:04.687
Is it now?

06:04.764 --> 06:06.129
Yeah, come on.

06:06.199 --> 06:07.530
Those guys,
they can't be real.

06:07.600 --> 06:11.730
Well, my son,
I'm sure you'll find out.

07:46.466 --> 07:49.060
How long have you
been there, my friend?

07:54.974 --> 07:56.703
They're over there.

07:57.176 --> 07:58.234
I bought them today.

07:59.479 --> 08:01.879
I haven't fed them at all.

08:02.915 --> 08:06.078
I will go up first.
You will follow.

08:06.152 --> 08:10.179
And remember, Mr. Wink,
don't be shy.

08:35.313 --> 08:38.909
<i>Next lot. Number 776.</i>

08:38.985 --> 08:41.476
<i>This is an important</i>
<i>votive figure,</i>

08:41.554 --> 08:47.151
<i>a fertility goddess dating
approximately 15,000 to 10,000 B.C.</i>

08:48.461 --> 08:50.361
<i>This was found</i>
<i>in a loess deposit</i>

08:50.429 --> 08:53.830
<i>in a terrace about 30 meters
from the Shannon River.</i>

08:53.900 --> 08:57.893
<i>And we'll open the</i>
<i>bidding at $300,000.</i>

08:57.970 --> 08:59.164
<i>Three hundred thousand.</i>

08:59.238 --> 09:01.763
<i>Three hundred and</i>
<i>twenty-five, thank you.</i>

09:01.841 --> 09:03.968
<i>Three hundred and fifty,</i>

<i>Three seventy-five.</i>

09:07.580 --> 09:10.208
<i>Three hundred</i>

09:10.349 --> 09:12.977
<i>Going once.</i>
<i>Going twice. Sold.</i>

09:14.020 --> 09:17.581
<i>And now we move on to
our next item, lot 777,</i>

09:19.091 --> 09:21.525
<i>a piece of the Royal</i>
<i>Crown of Bethmoora.</i>

09:21.594 --> 09:23.789
<i>The origin of this</i>
<i>piece harkens back</i>

09:23.930 --> 09:26.160
<i>to the saga of</i>
<i>the Sons of the Earth</i>

09:26.232 --> 09:29.724
<i>and the creation of</i>
<i>the fabled Golden Army.</i>

09:38.044 --> 09:40.604
<i>And here it is,</i>
<i>our next item.</i>

09:40.680 --> 09:43.274
<i>Lot 777.</i>

09:46.419 --> 09:48.683
Ladies and gentlemen,
please keep your seats.

09:48.754 --> 09:50.381
The auction will
restart shortly.

09:50.456 --> 09:52.754
I'm sure this is just
a temporary loss of power.

09:52.825 --> 09:55.316
Now, for the first
time at auction,

09:55.461 --> 09:57.986
a piece of the Royal
Crown of Bethmoora,

09:58.064 --> 10:02.125
coming to us from
a long lost culture.

10:02.201 --> 10:03.668
Lost?

10:05.037 --> 10:06.436
Not at all.

10:07.773 --> 10:09.900
Forgotten by you,
perhaps,

10:09.976 --> 10:12.410
but very, very much alive.

10:13.379 --> 10:15.006
Who are you, sir?

10:15.081 --> 10:18.141
Sir, please identify yourself.
You can't just...

10:18.217 --> 10:21.709
I am Prince Nuada Silverlance,
son of King Balor.

10:21.787 --> 10:26.451
And I am here, sir, to reclaim
what is rightfully mine.

10:26.525 --> 10:27.617
Security. Call security!

11:05.531 --> 11:06.828
What do you think
you're doing?

11:06.899 --> 11:08.161
This is outrageous.

11:08.234 --> 11:10.202
Take what you want.
Please leave.

11:10.269 --> 11:12.169
Anything, take anything.

11:19.979 --> 11:21.276
Be quiet.

11:26.419 --> 11:28.353
Sit down!

11:28.421 --> 11:31.948
Proud, empty, hollow
things that you are.

11:32.925 --> 11:36.759
Let this remind you why
you once feared the dark.

12:22.808 --> 12:26.574
<i>Fishstick. We have to talk.</i>

12:29.115 --> 12:30.605
Undercover.

12:30.683 --> 12:32.116
Can't he get the
meaning of the word?

12:32.184 --> 12:33.879
Look, we are still
government-funded.

12:33.953 --> 12:37.582
We are still a secret, although
a dirty secret, if you ask me.

12:37.656 --> 12:41.148
Officially we do
not exist, you see.

12:41.227 --> 12:44.162
So that's the problem
when we get these.

12:44.230 --> 12:48.599
Subway. Highway. Park.

12:49.869 --> 12:52.997
And he posed for this one
and gave an autograph.

12:55.107 --> 12:57.473
I suppress each photo.
Cell phone videos.

12:57.543 --> 13:01.206
They cost me a fortune and
they show up on YouTube.

13:01.280 --> 13:02.941
God, I hate YouTube.

13:03.015 --> 13:06.212
Well, he just wants the world
outside to know what we do,

13:06.285 --> 13:08.048
what he does.

13:08.120 --> 13:09.917
He loathes me.

13:09.989 --> 13:11.013
I don't think so.

13:11.090 --> 13:12.352
No?

13:12.424 --> 13:13.516
Target practice.

13:13.592 --> 13:14.684
Oh, dear.

13:14.760 --> 13:17.092
And then he
posts them around.

13:19.665 --> 13:21.656
Do you know how
that makes me feel?

13:27.973 --> 13:29.338
What's going on?

13:29.408 --> 13:30.705
Oh, it's Friday.

13:30.776 --> 13:32.607
I tell you, Fishstick,
he hates me.

13:32.678 --> 13:33.872
He's out to destroy me.

13:33.946 --> 13:35.880
My street cred is low.

13:35.948 --> 13:37.074
Street cred?

13:37.149 --> 13:38.207
My mojo.

13:38.284 --> 13:41.219
Washington, they're wondering
if I've got the stuff.

13:41.287 --> 13:42.549
You think I have
an easy job?

13:42.621 --> 13:48.560
Do you think
I enjoy being a pain in the neck?

13:51.230 --> 13:52.754
I am medicated.

13:54.033 --> 13:55.557
I mean,
this is not candy.

13:55.634 --> 13:57.124
This is...
It's an antacid.

13:57.203 --> 13:59.034
Yes, it's an
over-the-counter medicine,

13:59.104 --> 14:01.732
but this is medicine.

14:01.807 --> 14:05.368
You see, I worry
because, you know,

14:05.444 --> 14:08.470
I mean, I am,
we are, after all,

14:08.614 --> 14:11.640
we're just humble
public servants.

14:11.717 --> 14:14.880
It's not about you.
He's acting out.

14:14.954 --> 14:17.184
Things are a little
tense with Liz.

14:17.256 --> 14:20.521
Tense? How tense?
Tense how?

14:20.593 --> 14:23.084
Well, you know, the usual.

14:23.229 --> 14:25.493
A new couple
making adjustments.

14:25.564 --> 14:27.464
They argue.
They argue, huh?

14:27.533 --> 14:28.693
Sometimes.
How bad?

14:28.767 --> 14:30.029
Like everybody else.

14:30.102 --> 14:33.094
They have good days
and bad days.

14:35.207 --> 14:37.004
I'm not done with you.

15:00.733 --> 15:01.893
Hey, Abe.

15:01.967 --> 15:03.332
Red, come back here!

15:03.402 --> 15:04.528
Manning.

15:04.603 --> 15:05.831
Pick up your clothes!

15:05.905 --> 15:07.099
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

15:07.172 --> 15:08.639
Put away your things!

15:09.775 --> 15:11.766
Watch it,
boys, she's on fire.

15:11.844 --> 15:14.745
Then again, there are
the really bad days.

15:16.882 --> 15:17.940
I'm not afraid
of you, you know.

15:18.017 --> 15:20.485
You should be.
Look at this mess. Look around.

15:20.552 --> 15:23.487
I have one rule.
Don't touch my stuff.

15:23.555 --> 15:25.921
Oh, I get it.
That's your rule. Okay.

15:25.991 --> 15:28.323
The one and only.
I'm easy.

15:28.394 --> 15:29.486
How's that even possible?

15:29.561 --> 15:30.585
Everything is your stuff.

15:30.663 --> 15:32.392
The same CD, LP.

15:32.464 --> 15:33.692
It's Al Green.

15:33.766 --> 15:34.926
You can't listen
to Al Green on CD.

15:35.000 --> 15:36.160
But it's good to keep.

15:36.235 --> 15:37.725
And an eight-track.
An eight-track, Red?

15:37.803 --> 15:40.465
Yeah, well, one day, the world's
gonna realize its mistake.

15:40.539 --> 15:42.166
Eight-track was
the way to go, baby.

15:42.241 --> 15:44.766
Come on, kids,
you can come out now.

15:44.910 --> 15:47.470
That's right, it's all over.
That's right.

15:48.547 --> 15:50.174
And what about me, Red?

15:50.249 --> 15:51.807
I need some space.

15:54.253 --> 15:56.483
At least enough to
find my toothbrush.

15:56.622 --> 15:58.852
Toothbrush? Wait a minute.

16:01.360 --> 16:02.987
It's right there.

16:05.597 --> 16:08.589
Red! I can't
live like this.

16:10.102 --> 16:11.364
<i>Security breach</i>
<i>central Manhattan.</i>

16:11.437 --> 16:12.631
Oh, damn.

16:12.705 --> 16:14.468
Gotta go.
We all gotta go.

16:14.540 --> 16:16.508
It's an emergency, right?

16:16.575 --> 16:17.769
<i>Security breach.</i>
Let's go.

16:17.843 --> 16:19.367
Red. Red!

16:19.445 --> 16:20.912
<i>All personnel</i>
<i>to garage area.</i>

16:20.980 --> 16:22.413
Hold on a sec.

16:22.481 --> 16:25.450
Oh, jeez, it's Manning.
Watch yourself, Liz.

16:25.517 --> 16:26.916
Red. Red!

16:26.986 --> 16:28.510
Listen.

16:28.587 --> 16:29.645
Manning.
Hi.

16:29.722 --> 16:30.916
We're going to
downtown Manhattan.

16:30.990 --> 16:32.150
Yeah, it'll be fun.

16:32.224 --> 16:33.657
Downtown.
Very dangerous.

16:33.726 --> 16:35.125
Dangerous for you.

16:35.194 --> 16:37.355
And for me.

16:37.429 --> 16:39.624
Now, I know you dream
of the outside world,

16:39.698 --> 16:41.131
but, trust me,
it's not that great.

16:41.200 --> 16:44.829
It's savage, as a
matter of fact. Bad.

16:44.903 --> 16:46.803
Come on, fellas,
let's get this out of here.

16:46.872 --> 16:49.102
These, on the
other hand, are good.

16:49.775 --> 16:50.799
Mmm.

16:50.876 --> 16:52.434
Cuban.

16:52.511 --> 16:54.001
Good.

16:54.079 --> 16:55.205
Being seen?

16:55.280 --> 16:56.338
Bad.

16:56.415 --> 17:00.249
Exactly. I confiscated a box of these,
and I'll get you some more.

17:00.319 --> 17:03.846
But you've gotta do me
a little favor tonight, out there.

17:03.922 --> 17:07.414
You have to be...
You have to be very, very...

17:07.492 --> 17:08.482
Discreet.

17:08.560 --> 17:10.050
What? Thank you. Yes.
You're welcome.

17:10.128 --> 17:11.391
Discreet.

17:11.463 --> 17:14.522
Invisible. In and out.

17:15.768 --> 17:17.736
Really?
Hey.

17:17.803 --> 17:20.464
Hey, I can be
discreet if I wanna be.

17:20.539 --> 17:22.029
I followed you
and Myers, didn't I?

17:22.107 --> 17:24.165
And then you had him
transferred to Antarctica.

17:24.242 --> 17:25.904
That's very discreet.

17:26.045 --> 17:27.740
He said he liked the cold.

17:29.848 --> 17:31.247
Like a shadow.

17:32.551 --> 17:34.781
<i>Red team, Red team.</i>

17:36.989 --> 17:39.719
Like a shadow
in the night.

17:51.303 --> 17:54.795
US Customs discovered
a few illegally imported items.

17:54.873 --> 17:58.365
It's a minor infraction.
And a gas pocket.

17:58.444 --> 18:01.379
They detected
a gas pocket up there.

18:01.447 --> 18:04.746
Now FBI agents,
under my command,

18:04.817 --> 18:09.311
are going up there right now
with special gas equipment.

18:12.257 --> 18:14.225
Jeez, it stinks in here.

18:15.360 --> 18:16.884
This is worse
than my room.

18:16.962 --> 18:19.692
Waiting for a report on that.

18:21.867 --> 18:22.959
Say "cheese."

18:24.136 --> 18:25.603
Let's go.

18:53.899 --> 18:56.129
Whatever they
called us for is over.

18:56.201 --> 18:58.829
We had over 70
guests reported.

18:58.904 --> 19:01.498
We have no survivors,
no bodies.

19:01.573 --> 19:03.006
Same story here, babe.

19:03.075 --> 19:04.565
<i>Don't call me "babe."</i>

19:04.643 --> 19:07.612
"Abe," I said.
"Abe." Wrong channel.

19:10.315 --> 19:13.944
Abe, I think Liz is
still mad at me.

19:14.019 --> 19:15.486
<i>Still the same channel.</i>

19:15.554 --> 19:16.543
Oh!

19:32.905 --> 19:34.202
<i>Can I ask</i>
<i>you a question?</i>

19:34.273 --> 19:35.535
No.

19:35.607 --> 19:37.438
Now, listen.
When we get home later,

19:37.509 --> 19:39.272
I'm gonna clean up
my whole mess.

19:39.344 --> 19:40.572
That's not the problem.

19:40.646 --> 19:41.670
What is it?

19:41.747 --> 19:42.771
Not now.

19:51.223 --> 19:53.521
Abe, what have you got?

19:53.592 --> 19:55.753
Oh, this is interesting.

19:55.827 --> 19:58.387
Both boxes have
the Royal Seal.

19:58.463 --> 20:01.227
Only delivered
at a time of war.

20:37.569 --> 20:40.299
Red? We have company.

20:42.441 --> 20:44.909
<i>Come on, Blue,</i>
<i>give me something to work with here.</i>

20:44.977 --> 20:46.444
Burrowing creatures.

20:46.511 --> 20:47.944
How many of them?
<i>- Many.</i>

20:48.013 --> 20:52.006
There are no corpses because
there are no leftovers.

20:52.084 --> 20:53.984
<i>Have you noticed the floor?</i>

20:54.052 --> 20:55.076
Oh, crap.

20:55.153 --> 20:56.142
<i>Precisely.</i>

20:56.221 --> 20:58.212
All these things
do is eat and eat.

20:58.290 --> 21:00.258
Then poop,
and then eat again.

21:00.325 --> 21:02.156
Remind you of anyone?

21:02.861 --> 21:04.795
Damn it, Abe.
What are these things?

21:07.399 --> 21:08.866
<i>English, English.</i>

21:08.934 --> 21:09.958
Oh, they're Tooth Fairies.

21:10.035 --> 21:11.195
Ha!

21:11.270 --> 21:13.329
No, no. Third century,
Black Forest.

21:13.405 --> 21:17.171
Feed mostly on calcium,
bones, skin, organs.

21:17.242 --> 21:21.008
But they do go
for the teeth first.

21:21.079 --> 21:23.104
Hence the name
Tooth Fairies.

21:23.181 --> 21:26.048
I bet you they don't
leave money, either.

21:37.663 --> 21:39.028
Oh, my God.

21:40.799 --> 21:43.029
Liz, you're pregnant.

21:43.101 --> 21:44.398
No, I'm not.

21:44.536 --> 21:45.867
Yes, you are.

21:58.417 --> 22:00.112
What have you got, Marble?

22:00.252 --> 22:02.049
Think I may have found one.

22:03.755 --> 22:05.655
But he's kind of cute.

22:08.093 --> 22:09.822
Don't go near it!

22:18.203 --> 22:19.898
It's biting me!

22:22.174 --> 22:23.505
Marble.

22:23.575 --> 22:25.406
It hurts! It hurts!

22:45.364 --> 22:47.229
<i>Red, we need you here!</i>

22:50.235 --> 22:51.463
Marble.

22:54.506 --> 22:55.905
Nasty little...

23:08.954 --> 23:11.081
Keep firing, Abe.
Keep firing!

23:25.036 --> 23:26.128
Damn.

23:47.592 --> 23:49.025
Sorry, lady.

23:55.066 --> 23:57.091
You should be running.

23:57.169 --> 23:59.137
There's a safe upstairs.

23:59.204 --> 24:00.603
How do we get there?

24:00.672 --> 24:02.139
We need a clearing.

24:03.208 --> 24:04.300
Run!

24:11.116 --> 24:12.879
Up to the safe, now!

24:16.054 --> 24:17.919
Abe. Up the stairs.

24:21.993 --> 24:25.019
Come on, Liz, burn them all.
Go. Go!

24:25.096 --> 24:27.121
Yes, we're going!

24:27.732 --> 24:30.394
Get in the safe, Abe.
Get in the safe!

24:40.145 --> 24:41.476
Oh, no, no.

24:42.380 --> 24:44.905
No, no, no!

24:44.983 --> 24:46.143
Steel!

24:57.963 --> 24:59.362
Damned beasts.

25:05.403 --> 25:07.871
Fire is mine.

25:08.807 --> 25:11.002
Fire is in me.

25:11.076 --> 25:13.772
Red, stay away
from the window!

25:14.946 --> 25:17.437
Fire is me.

25:17.516 --> 25:19.950
Stop biting me!

25:22.687 --> 25:27.056
Fire is me.

25:28.426 --> 25:30.621
World, here I come.

26:17.309 --> 26:19.072
What have you done?

26:20.011 --> 26:21.171
Guess we're out.

26:21.246 --> 26:23.339
Hey, Hellboy,
over here.

26:57.449 --> 26:59.474
Your Royal Highness.

27:12.364 --> 27:15.424
Before entering
the council chamber,

27:15.500 --> 27:19.994
you must surrender
your weapon.

27:20.071 --> 27:21.538
I will not.

27:24.643 --> 27:30.707
It is protocol, sire,
for peasant and prince alike.

27:45.930 --> 27:47.693
For you, Sister,

27:49.634 --> 27:50.999
anything.

27:54.339 --> 27:58.332
<i>According to multiple eye witnesses,
lives were, in fact, endangered.</i>

27:58.410 --> 27:59.934
<i>There you have it, Hellboy.</i>

28:00.011 --> 28:01.740
<i>But is he really</i>
<i>on our side?</i>

28:01.813 --> 28:03.110
<i>Do you have superpowers?</i>

28:03.181 --> 28:04.409
<i>Well, yeah.</i>

28:04.482 --> 28:07.178
<i>But, really, all I wanna be
is just an ordinary person,</i>

28:07.252 --> 28:08.446
<i>just like you and</i>
<i>you and everybody.</i>

28:10.522 --> 28:12.547
Hey, guys.
You're missing this.

28:13.658 --> 28:15.023
We're on TV.

28:17.529 --> 28:19.121
Liz. Liz,
are you all right?

28:19.197 --> 28:21.097
Yeah, I'll be out
in a minute.

28:21.833 --> 28:23.767
You don't need to do that.
You can trust me.

28:23.835 --> 28:25.063
My readings are
quite accurate.

28:25.136 --> 28:26.296
Shut up, Abe.

28:26.371 --> 28:28.999
Get your damn hand
away from the door.

28:29.874 --> 28:32.069
You have nothing to fear.

28:32.143 --> 28:33.440
In spite of appearances,

28:33.511 --> 28:36.378
I believe Red would be an
excellent father figure.

28:38.383 --> 28:40.943
<i>And what about this guy?</i>

28:41.019 --> 28:42.714
<i>Walking around with a
toilet seat on his head.</i>

28:42.787 --> 28:44.015
A toilet seat!

28:44.089 --> 28:47.456
It's quite obvious it's
a breathing apparatus.

28:47.525 --> 28:49.755
Hey, I think we gotta
lose the garbage truck.

28:49.828 --> 28:51.853
Sends out the wrong signal.

28:53.064 --> 28:55.294
You think that's
our problem?

28:55.366 --> 28:56.890
Transportation?

28:58.670 --> 29:01.434
<i>And this girl, we definitely have
to find out what's wrong with her.</i>

29:01.506 --> 29:03.565
<i>She's cute, though.</i>
<i>We should get her on the show.</i>

29:03.641 --> 29:06.474
I hate it when
people stare at me.

29:06.544 --> 29:09.206
Makes me feel
like a freak.

29:09.280 --> 29:11.441
You had no right, Red.

29:11.516 --> 29:12.608
It's Manning. Could you...

29:12.684 --> 29:13.708
<i>How many times do</i>
<i>I have to tell you?</i>

29:13.785 --> 29:16.549
<i>It's a gas pocket.</i>

29:16.621 --> 29:19.089
<i>And a gaseous</i>
<i>phenomenon that occurred...</i>

29:22.627 --> 29:25.425
Gas pocket.
What an idiot.

29:27.665 --> 29:29.326
You've murdered me.

29:29.968 --> 29:31.629
You have murdered me.

29:34.539 --> 29:36.404
You have ridiculed me.

29:39.911 --> 29:42.004
And you have brought
this unto yourself.

29:42.080 --> 29:43.342
What?

29:43.414 --> 29:47.350
Washington is sending
down a new BPRD agent.

29:47.418 --> 29:48.885
A new guy?

29:49.821 --> 29:51.152
Why?

29:51.222 --> 29:52.621
To look after you.

29:59.197 --> 30:01.893
Sire, please.

30:23.121 --> 30:25.988
To set us free.
All of us, Father.

30:31.596 --> 30:33.655
A truce based on shame.

30:34.899 --> 30:37.629
The humans have
forgotten the gods,

30:37.702 --> 30:40.136
destroyed the Earth.
And for what?

30:42.073 --> 30:45.065
Parking lots.
Shopping malls.

30:45.143 --> 30:47.475
Greed has burned a hole in their
heart that will never be filled.

30:47.545 --> 30:49.672
They will never
have enough.

30:57.222 --> 30:58.211
Honor?

30:59.324 --> 31:02.487
Look at this place.
Where is the honor in it?

31:03.595 --> 31:05.961
Father, you were
once a proud warrior.

31:06.030 --> 31:08.328
When did you
become their pet?

31:11.603 --> 31:14.197
I have returned
from exile to wage war

31:14.339 --> 31:16.967
and reclaim our land,
our birthright.

31:18.209 --> 31:21.144
And for that, I will call upon
the help of all of my people.

31:21.212 --> 31:23.339
And they will answer,

31:23.414 --> 31:26.645
the good, the bad

31:28.686 --> 31:30.051
and the worst.

31:33.858 --> 31:37.521
Perhaps I am.
Perhaps they made me so.

31:50.441 --> 31:52.966
We will not fade.

31:58.883 --> 32:00.077
It is.

32:00.718 --> 32:01.844
I am sorry, Father.

32:14.465 --> 32:19.562
And you, Sister, are you at
peace with your king's verdict?

32:19.637 --> 32:22.197
I am, my brother. I am.

32:24.442 --> 32:27.070
Then very well.
Death it is.

34:21.292 --> 34:24.125
Now, for the final piece,
my sister.

34:28.166 --> 34:30.464
Where is she, Wink?
Where is she?

34:38.576 --> 34:41.545
Go find her.
Now! Find her!

34:46.284 --> 34:49.253
<i>Elevator</i>
<i>arriving now to section 42.</i>

34:50.888 --> 34:54.289
<i>Elevator arriving</i>
<i>now to section 42.</i>

34:56.127 --> 34:57.924
Pardon me, boys.
Excuse me. Excuse me.

34:57.995 --> 34:59.656
Is he here?
Not yet.

34:59.730 --> 35:00.890
I'm telling you,
we don't need this guy.

35:00.965 --> 35:02.057
Well, I think we do.

35:02.133 --> 35:04.761
Evidently, this guy's quite
the big shot in Washington.

35:04.836 --> 35:06.929
What's his name?

35:07.004 --> 35:09.029
His name is Johann Krauss.

35:09.107 --> 35:11.701
Johann Krauss?
Sounds German.

35:11.776 --> 35:13.334
He's the top man in...

35:13.411 --> 35:14.435
Ectoplasmic.

35:14.512 --> 35:16.776
Yes, thank you.
Ectoplasmic research.

35:16.848 --> 35:19.339
Comes highly recommended
by our European liaison.

35:19.417 --> 35:20.782
Johann Krauss.
"Liaison."

35:20.852 --> 35:22.444
I love that word,
don't you?

35:22.520 --> 35:24.044
It's so hoity toity.

35:24.122 --> 35:25.589
I don't like Germans.
No fingerprints.

35:25.656 --> 35:27.351
Here he comes.
Germans make me nervous.

35:27.425 --> 35:32.624
No photo. Dossier says, and I translate,
"He has a nice open face."

35:46.777 --> 35:48.574
Oh, my God.

35:49.180 --> 35:52.809
<i>Damen und Herren,</i>
Johann Krauss at your service.

35:53.818 --> 35:55.809
I like him.

36:00.591 --> 36:02.786
Look at that.
Poor little thing.

36:02.860 --> 36:04.521
Bought and sold on
the black market.

36:04.595 --> 36:06.187
Crammed into
cargo containers.

36:06.264 --> 36:08.630
Smuggled, abused.

36:08.699 --> 36:10.223
He has very
expressive hands.

36:10.301 --> 36:12.360
The seal on the box
worries me also.

36:12.436 --> 36:13.596
A warring emblem.

36:13.671 --> 36:14.797
Yes, from the Bethmoora clan.

36:14.872 --> 36:15.896
The Sons of the Earth.

36:15.973 --> 36:18.134
Your file says you're the
brains of the operation,

36:18.209 --> 36:19.699
and I must admit,
I'm impressed.

36:19.777 --> 36:21.574
In my file, you'll see,
Mr. Krauss,

36:21.646 --> 36:24.615
that I worked very closely
with Abe in his training.

36:24.682 --> 36:25.774
<i>Ja,</i> okay.

36:25.850 --> 36:27.784
Let's see what our little
friend here can remember.

36:27.852 --> 36:30.980
Memory gets a little sketchy
right after you've burned to death.

36:31.055 --> 36:35.355
But maybe Saint
Malachy can help.

36:35.426 --> 36:37.656
Oh, no, no.
No amulets, <i>Mein Herr.</i>

36:37.728 --> 36:38.922
Teleplasty.

36:38.996 --> 36:40.520
Plastic. Very modern.

36:41.465 --> 36:43.956
Teleplasty by which
an ectoplasmic medium,

36:44.035 --> 36:48.028
such as Dr. Krauss,
can control inanimate things,

36:48.105 --> 36:52.667
organic, mechanical,
dead or alive.

36:52.743 --> 36:55.644
Take it, take it all in,
<i>mein Junge.</i>

36:57.715 --> 37:01.151
There we are. Get up.

37:01.719 --> 37:03.619
Get up. Get up.

37:04.789 --> 37:07.724
Now I have full control
of its limbic system.

37:07.792 --> 37:09.817
Let us see how long
I can hold it.

37:10.995 --> 37:12.485
What?

37:12.563 --> 37:14.861
Hey, you chewed off
the tip of my tail.

37:15.499 --> 37:16.864
Yeah, you, you little...

37:16.934 --> 37:20.370
It says you're rude, brutish
<i>und</i> not very bright.

37:20.438 --> 37:21.496
Wow!

37:26.177 --> 37:28.077
It seems our
little friend here

37:28.145 --> 37:29.976
remembers market
sounds and voices.

37:30.047 --> 37:32.515
And a peculiar
troll language spoken

37:32.583 --> 37:34.107
in the last place
his cage was opened.

37:34.185 --> 37:36.085
The troll market.

37:36.153 --> 37:37.984
The troll market?
Come on.

37:38.789 --> 37:40.381
No one's ever found it.

37:40.524 --> 37:42.515
That's because
it doesn't exist.

37:46.864 --> 37:49.298
Mr. Krauss? Dr. Krauss, sir.

37:49.367 --> 37:52.495
Our little informant there
doesn't look so good.

38:08.419 --> 38:10.819
Back inside, you.
There we are.

38:10.955 --> 38:13.355
So, now we know
where to begin.

38:13.424 --> 38:15.415
Trolls dwell under bridges.

38:15.493 --> 38:17.461
Wow. You're a genius.

38:17.528 --> 38:20.929
By the way, there's over
2,000 bridges in New York City.

38:20.998 --> 38:24.126
But Vladimir Vanya, 19th
century occult historian,

38:24.201 --> 38:25.691
places the troll
market directly under

38:25.770 --> 38:27.203
the east end of
the Brooklyn Bridge.

38:27.271 --> 38:28.295
We've already looked there.

38:28.372 --> 38:30.169
Yes, you have,
but not with me, Agent.

38:30.241 --> 38:31.765
Not with me.

38:31.842 --> 38:33.434
We're moving in.

38:50.728 --> 38:53.094
Keep it coming, keep it coming.
Hold it.

38:57.068 --> 38:59.400
"Not with me, Agent."
What an ego.

38:59.470 --> 39:00.596
I like him.

39:00.671 --> 39:02.571
Well, you can keep him.

39:05.409 --> 39:07.274
I mean, am I the only one that
thinks this guy is full of...

39:07.345 --> 39:08.607
No, no, no, no,
don't lean.

39:08.679 --> 39:12.445
Lot 336, the Schufftein
glasses. Could it be?

39:12.516 --> 39:14.177
The three surviving
pairs,

39:14.251 --> 39:15.843
and we will use them to
locate the troll market.

39:15.920 --> 39:17.785
Dr. Krauss, what a coup.

39:17.855 --> 39:19.584
The Schufftein glasses.

39:19.657 --> 39:21.648
You're my hero.

39:21.726 --> 39:22.852
Hey. You Hellboy?

39:22.927 --> 39:23.985
Yeah.

39:24.061 --> 39:25.688
You're ugly, man.

39:26.964 --> 39:29.398
Two more on
the wall in front of me

39:29.533 --> 39:32.093
and then three on
the alleys facing that way.

39:33.304 --> 39:34.430
What do you think of
Mr. Know-It-All?

39:34.505 --> 39:35.597
Don't know,
too early to tell.

39:35.673 --> 39:36.901
Hey, you're Hellboy.

39:36.974 --> 39:38.134
I know, I'm ugly.

39:38.209 --> 39:39.608
Forget it.

39:39.744 --> 39:41.473
We'll talk about it later.

39:42.113 --> 39:46.709
He's sure of himself, and I
think maybe you're intimidated.

39:47.385 --> 39:49.717
Intimidated. Huh?

39:55.259 --> 39:58.353
<i> Keep us up to date on thecameras, Agent Sherman.
Over and out.</i>

39:58.429 --> 39:59.828
What's this?

40:01.532 --> 40:04.126
Normally, we can't see
fairy folk and trolls.

40:04.235 --> 40:08.729
They generate a cloaking
aura called "glamour."

40:08.806 --> 40:12.105
But in 1878,
Emil Schufftein designed and built these.

40:12.176 --> 40:15.077
<i>Four crystal diopters</i>
<i>that penetrate that effect</i>

40:15.146 --> 40:17.614
<i>and reveal the true</i>
<i>nature of things.</i>

40:17.681 --> 40:20.707
Oh, Dr. Krauss, they're more
beautiful than I'd imagined.

40:20.785 --> 40:22.184
You must try them on then.
Oh, yes.

40:22.253 --> 40:24.118
Try them on, Agent.
They'll look good.

40:24.188 --> 40:26.019
I love these tight
little leather straps.

40:26.090 --> 40:27.489
Intimidated?

40:29.593 --> 40:31.424
Mr. Kraut? Sir?

40:31.495 --> 40:33.588
Krauss, Agent.
With a double "S."

40:33.664 --> 40:35.689
S-S. Right, right.

40:35.766 --> 40:37.961
Listen, those gizmos?

40:41.772 --> 40:44.400
How do you know they work?

40:44.475 --> 40:45.533
<i>I have a suspect.</i>

40:45.609 --> 40:48.339
Give me a vector,
Agent Sherman. A vector.

40:48.746 --> 40:51.010
B-12, the alley, northbound.

40:51.081 --> 40:53.345
<i>Well, track the target.</i>
<i>We're coming down.</i>

40:53.417 --> 40:55.647
Keep an eye on her.
I'll be right back.

40:55.719 --> 40:57.482
This little old lady?
Come on.

40:57.555 --> 41:00.490
It's a Fragglewump,
an ugly Scottish troll.

41:00.558 --> 41:02.185
They're afraid of canaries.

41:02.259 --> 41:05.251
Oh, my God. Canaries, huh?

41:06.263 --> 41:07.321
What about the kittens?

41:07.398 --> 41:08.422
She feeds on them.

41:08.499 --> 41:10.865
Come on, then.
Kitty, kitty, kitty.

41:10.935 --> 41:12.596
That thing is a "she"?

41:34.024 --> 41:35.150
Down, you fools.

41:35.226 --> 41:36.523
What do you think
you are doing?

41:36.594 --> 41:37.856
She's gonna eat the cat.

41:37.928 --> 41:40.829
You'll make her
aware of our presence.

41:40.898 --> 41:42.058
We should use
the canary now.

41:42.132 --> 41:43.258
She's gonna eat it!

41:43.334 --> 41:44.562
We should use
the bird, Dr. Krauss.

41:44.635 --> 41:45.795
The bird.

41:48.239 --> 41:49.365
She's going to eat the cat.

41:49.440 --> 41:50.532
You will stay put
and follow my orders.

41:50.608 --> 41:51.666
I can't sit by here...

41:51.742 --> 41:53.767
You are directly under my command,
and you have to obey.

41:53.844 --> 41:55.402
Stay put!
Oh, screw this!

41:55.479 --> 41:56.810
Hey! Lucy.

41:56.881 --> 41:58.143
Come back here.

41:58.215 --> 41:59.910
I'm home.

41:59.984 --> 42:02.418
Oh, yes, dearie.
Can I help you?

42:02.486 --> 42:04.716
Give it up, nasty.
We can see you.

42:04.788 --> 42:06.153
You see me?

42:06.223 --> 42:08.748
How? How do you see me?

42:09.793 --> 42:11.317
We're looking
for the entrance

42:11.395 --> 42:12.862
to the troll market.
Any clues?

42:12.930 --> 42:15.160
Come any closer and
I'll rip your heart.

42:15.232 --> 42:16.995
We're gonna have to get
a little old-school, Abe.

42:17.067 --> 42:18.796
Give me the bird.

42:20.337 --> 42:22.032
Not a canary.

42:22.106 --> 42:24.870
What, you're afraid
of this little guy?

42:24.942 --> 42:26.239
Who'd know?

42:26.310 --> 42:27.538
No more, no more.

42:27.611 --> 42:29.101
I'll take you there.

42:31.715 --> 42:34.912
Come on, let's go,
you dirty old troll.

42:51.902 --> 42:53.369
Let's go.

42:53.470 --> 42:56.166
Agent Sherman, we are
going into the troll market.

42:56.240 --> 42:57.605
Keep communication
to a minimum.

42:57.675 --> 42:59.006
Over <i>und</i> out.

42:59.076 --> 43:00.873
I like him.

43:00.945 --> 43:02.537
You see, this is
a man who takes charge.

43:02.613 --> 43:03.637
You think?

43:03.714 --> 43:04.840
Yeah. He's efficient.

43:04.915 --> 43:06.746
He's precise.

43:06.817 --> 43:09.251
You add "resistant" to that,
you got yourself a new watch.

43:09.320 --> 43:13.051
Dr. Krauss is aware of the
chain of command, and he...

43:13.123 --> 43:14.249
Oh, brother!

43:14.325 --> 43:15.815
He seems to like me.

43:20.464 --> 43:22.091
Here we are.

43:23.634 --> 43:25.534
Wow, that's some door!

43:29.640 --> 43:31.665
It's a complex
combination lock.

43:31.809 --> 43:33.868
What do you think,
Agent Sapien?

43:34.979 --> 43:36.071
Not good.

43:36.146 --> 43:39.240
With the number of symbols on the
combination, we'll be here for days.

43:39.316 --> 43:40.442
Well, not necessarily.

43:40.517 --> 43:42.212
Let me try my technique.

43:42.286 --> 43:43.617
Open it, Lucy.

43:43.687 --> 43:45.211
I will not.

43:45.289 --> 43:46.517
Pretty please.

43:48.125 --> 43:49.786
Do as you may, demon.

43:49.927 --> 43:51.588
Release the yellow beast.

43:51.662 --> 43:52.822
Tear my eyes out.

43:52.896 --> 43:55.831
Rip my insides and
my legs and my tongue,

43:55.899 --> 43:58.231
but I will never
open that door.

44:06.210 --> 44:08.610
Is that your
investigative technique?

44:08.679 --> 44:09.873
It said "never."

44:09.947 --> 44:11.437
It's unconscionable.

44:12.216 --> 44:13.581
That means
he didn't like it.

44:13.651 --> 44:14.982
What?

44:15.052 --> 44:16.986
So, what, you're gonna
show us how it's done,

44:17.054 --> 44:19.079
Mr. By-The-Book?

44:19.323 --> 44:20.756
Is that it?

44:20.824 --> 44:23.258
Yes, I think I will.

44:27.965 --> 44:29.296
There we are.

44:30.801 --> 44:33.429
Let me see. Yes.

44:53.190 --> 44:56.489
Gentlemen, welcome
to the troll market.

45:34.932 --> 45:38.800
<i>Red, there's something really
important that I need to tell you.</i>

45:38.869 --> 45:41.463
Oh, Liz, you should
be here. You'd love it.

45:41.538 --> 45:43.938
Nobody's looking at us.
We blend right in.

45:44.007 --> 45:46.703
Agent, I said keep
communication to a minimum.

45:46.777 --> 45:48.404
You'll blow our cover.

45:48.479 --> 45:50.310
You know?
I think he's right.

45:51.915 --> 45:54.008
I'm bringing you
here for sure, babe.

45:54.084 --> 45:55.745
<i>The fishbowl wants</i>
<i>radio silence. So...</i>

45:55.819 --> 45:57.446
Over and out.

46:20.444 --> 46:21.968
The Royal Seal.

46:36.660 --> 46:38.753
Brother Red.
Red, do you read me?

46:38.829 --> 46:41.798
Yeah, I read you, Blue,
but I'm watching Sherlock at work.

46:41.865 --> 46:42.991
I'll get back to you.

46:43.066 --> 46:44.124
Excuse me, sir.

46:44.201 --> 46:47.932
Sir, excuse... Pardon me.
Sir, may I ask a...

46:52.242 --> 46:54.472
I gotta tell
the boys that one.

46:54.545 --> 46:55.569
Excuse me, gentlemen.

46:55.646 --> 46:58.581
Have you seen anyone purchasing
this type of Tooth Fairy?

46:58.649 --> 47:00.241
No one sells them
down here, pal.

47:00.317 --> 47:01.841
Over in Jersey, maybe.

47:01.919 --> 47:03.910
Well, what about this, then?

47:04.054 --> 47:06.045
Do you recognize this seal?

47:06.123 --> 47:07.590
Make him go away.
Make him go away.

47:07.658 --> 47:09.057
No. We don't.

47:09.126 --> 47:10.286
Please, dear sir.

47:10.360 --> 47:12.885
You'd better go. Now!

47:12.963 --> 47:14.157
We'll make it
worth your while.

47:15.432 --> 47:18.060
Don't waste your time.
We will not talk!

47:18.569 --> 47:19.558
What are you doing?

47:19.636 --> 47:21.365
You're absolutely
sure about that, huh?

47:21.438 --> 47:22.803
Absolutely.

47:22.873 --> 47:23.965
You won't talk, eh?

47:24.041 --> 47:25.065
Never.

47:25.142 --> 47:26.302
Never, huh?

47:26.376 --> 47:28.810
Never ever, ever.

47:53.904 --> 47:55.064
Feeling a little
chattier now?

47:55.138 --> 47:56.503
We'll never talk.

47:56.740 --> 47:58.173
Yes, yes.

47:58.242 --> 48:00.767
We will, only don't
hit me anymore.

48:00.844 --> 48:02.334
Chicken.

48:02.412 --> 48:04.039
Who bought
the Tooth Fairies?

48:04.114 --> 48:05.706
Prince Nuada.

48:05.782 --> 48:07.841
They say Prince Nuada
broke the truce,

48:07.918 --> 48:09.579
and now there is
talk of war,

48:09.653 --> 48:11.780
a war with
the human world.

48:13.390 --> 48:14.414
Sorry, kid.

48:14.491 --> 48:15.856
That's all right.

48:16.093 --> 48:17.458
Nice baby.

48:17.527 --> 48:19.995
I'm not a baby.
I'm a tumor.

48:22.966 --> 48:27.300
Yes, Red. I am following
a lead right now.

48:27.371 --> 48:29.032
It may turn out...

48:31.508 --> 48:33.772
It may turn out
to be nothing,

48:33.911 --> 48:36.209
but I will let you
know soon enough.

49:05.175 --> 49:07.905
What do you want?
Tell me your name.

49:14.785 --> 49:16.252
Follow me.

49:18.288 --> 49:20.756
Your father
left you this map.

49:20.824 --> 49:23.850
In it, he said,
lies the secret

49:23.994 --> 49:26.519
to the location
of the Golden Army.

49:27.831 --> 49:30.299
Move away!
Quickly, Your Highness.

49:33.637 --> 49:35.502
Can I help you
with something?

49:35.572 --> 49:37.403
No, thank you.
I'm just looking.

49:37.474 --> 49:39.237
You can't go in there!

49:39.309 --> 49:40.776
Sir, why
are you following me?

49:40.844 --> 49:42.334
I...

49:42.512 --> 49:46.312
I was just hoping to find
an old map chart of Algiers.

49:46.383 --> 49:47.975
Why are you following me?

49:48.051 --> 49:49.678
I was not.

49:49.853 --> 49:52.549
Did my brother send you
to steal the crown piece?

49:52.622 --> 49:53.884
Your brother?

49:53.957 --> 49:56.755
Oh, you're sorely
mistaken, I assure you.

49:57.260 --> 49:58.727
Then answer me truthfully.

49:58.795 --> 50:00.524
Why were you following me?

50:03.200 --> 50:05.760
My name is Abraham Sapien.

50:07.471 --> 50:08.631
There is no such name.

50:08.705 --> 50:10.002
Oh, I don't like
it either, but I...

50:10.073 --> 50:11.301
Enough.

50:11.375 --> 50:13.639
Give me your hand.

50:13.710 --> 50:15.041
Your hand.

50:22.519 --> 50:24.214
You are an agent

50:24.287 --> 50:27.586
for the Bureau of Paranormal
Research and Defense.

50:28.692 --> 50:30.455
And your name is...

50:31.828 --> 50:32.817
Oh...

50:33.230 --> 50:34.857
Horrible, I know.

50:34.931 --> 50:37.559
I'm Nuala,
Princess Nuala.

50:38.135 --> 50:39.602
Yes, I know.

50:39.669 --> 50:41.500
Forgive me,
Your Highness,

50:41.571 --> 50:43.562
but as you were
learning about me,

50:43.640 --> 50:46.803
I couldn't help but learn
a bit about you myself.

50:48.311 --> 50:50.006
I know that you
need our help.

50:50.080 --> 50:52.139
I'm afraid it's
the other way around.

51:02.125 --> 51:03.524
The window. Out now.

51:03.593 --> 51:04.958
I will take care of this.

51:05.028 --> 51:06.290
Oh, dear.

51:26.850 --> 51:28.374
Go! Now go!

51:47.771 --> 51:49.705
Get out of here, Blue.

51:49.773 --> 51:51.638
Yes. Come with me,
Your Highness.

51:51.708 --> 51:52.697
You.

51:54.611 --> 51:57.671
Let me put this to you
as delicately as I can.

52:04.654 --> 52:06.622
My cigar, it was Cuban.

52:07.324 --> 52:09.224
Now you pissed me off.

52:18.468 --> 52:19.765
Oh, crap.

52:28.111 --> 52:29.100
Whoa!

53:41.051 --> 53:42.575
Now stay down!

53:59.769 --> 54:00.895
Damn.

54:04.441 --> 54:06.409
A tooth. Happy?

54:12.449 --> 54:14.542
Give it up, pal.
It's over.

54:16.119 --> 54:18.314
I wouldn't do that
if I were you.

54:31.601 --> 54:33.569
Wow. Told you.

54:42.879 --> 54:45.905
<i>Oh, mein Gott,</i>
what have you done, Agent Hellboy?

54:45.982 --> 54:47.847
Look at this!
Now we have to leave.

54:47.917 --> 54:50.477
Red. This is Princess Nuala.

54:51.354 --> 54:52.685
Lady.

54:52.756 --> 54:54.018
We should leave.
Now. Now!

54:54.090 --> 54:55.387
Let's go.

55:32.329 --> 55:35.924
To wage his war,
my brother needs this,

55:35.999 --> 55:38.263
the final piece of
the Crown of Bethmoora

55:38.335 --> 55:40.803
and this map to the location
of the Golden Army chamber.

55:40.870 --> 55:42.963
The Golden Army.

55:43.039 --> 55:44.666
The harbingers of death.

55:44.741 --> 55:46.333
The unstoppable tide.

55:47.210 --> 55:48.199
Howdy Doody.

55:48.278 --> 55:51.008
Your Highness, if you hand
the crown piece over to us...

55:51.081 --> 55:53.276
No. Where it goes, I go.

55:54.250 --> 55:56.684
My father died to uphold
the truce with your world.

55:56.753 --> 55:58.448
You must honor
his noble intention.

55:58.521 --> 55:59.818
The lady's
in dire danger.

55:59.889 --> 56:02.517
I take it you're vouching for her,
Agent Sapien?

56:02.592 --> 56:05.083
Most emphatically.
Yes, I am.

56:05.161 --> 56:06.389
Even so.

56:07.063 --> 56:09.998
I am sorry, but we
simply cannot assume

56:10.066 --> 56:12.057
such responsibility
on our own.

56:12.135 --> 56:13.500
The lady just
lost her father.

56:13.570 --> 56:14.901
What more do you want?

56:14.971 --> 56:18.202
You may not care, but
there are procedures, rules

56:18.274 --> 56:19.764
and little handbooks...

56:19.843 --> 56:21.276
She's coming with us.

56:21.344 --> 56:22.436
You got that, Gas Bag?

56:22.512 --> 56:23.570
What did you call me?

56:23.646 --> 56:25.045
You.

56:27.851 --> 56:30.046
You will pay for what happened
to my friend down there.

56:30.120 --> 56:32.350
Yeah, right.
You take checks?

56:32.422 --> 56:33.684
Demon.

56:33.757 --> 56:35.054
Born from a womb of shadows.

56:35.125 --> 56:37.958
Sent to destroy their world,
and you still believe you belong.

56:38.027 --> 56:39.494
Are we gonna
talk all night?

56:39.562 --> 56:41.257
'Cause I'm really sleepy.

56:44.701 --> 56:46.293
No, Brother, no!

56:58.615 --> 56:59.877
Kill him.

57:10.760 --> 57:12.455
It's just a jumping bean.

57:12.529 --> 57:14.360
It's going for water. Hurry.

57:18.101 --> 57:19.090
Oh, dear.

57:20.336 --> 57:22.804
No. No, no, no, no. No.

57:52.101 --> 57:54.001
What the hell is that?
- Excuse me!

57:55.738 --> 57:58.138
Stay back.
- Hey, what's going on?

58:25.235 --> 58:27.260
<i>We've got</i>
<i>target in sight.</i>

58:28.605 --> 58:30.596
It's an Elemental,

58:30.673 --> 58:32.800
a giver of life
and a destroyer.

58:32.876 --> 58:33.934
What?

58:34.010 --> 58:35.238
A Forest God.

58:36.579 --> 58:38.479
A Forest God, eh?

58:40.550 --> 58:42.609
I'm gonna get me Big Baby.

58:50.493 --> 58:54.088
Somebody help! My baby's...
Help! Help!

58:54.597 --> 58:55.757
How can I help you, ma'am?

58:55.832 --> 58:57.595
My baby's inside!

58:57.667 --> 58:59.532
Come with us,
dear lady, please.

58:59.602 --> 59:01.069
There's nothing
to worry about.

59:01.137 --> 59:02.570
We've got everything
under control.

59:02.639 --> 59:05.733
Please. My baby's
still in there! Please!

59:18.855 --> 59:20.618
Hey, little guy.

59:36.539 --> 59:38.370
<i>Homing in on target.</i>

59:42.278 --> 59:43.768
Hang on, kid.

59:54.390 --> 59:55.448
Agent Hellboy.

59:55.525 --> 59:57.755
Reach higher ground
and shoot the weapon.

59:58.061 --> 59:59.289
Shoot the weapon!

01:00:15.511 --> 01:00:17.604
First praise the tail, kid.

01:00:34.097 --> 01:00:36.258
You must shoot it in
the energy ganglion.

01:00:36.332 --> 01:00:37.356
The what?

01:00:37.433 --> 01:00:38.422
The energy ganglion.

01:00:38.501 --> 01:00:41.368
<i>Scheisse.</i> The head!
Shoot it in the head!

01:00:42.105 --> 01:00:43.094
Whoa!

01:00:53.182 --> 01:00:54.513
Oh, crap.

01:00:59.188 --> 01:01:01.850
You gotta trust me,
little buddy. Okay?

01:01:12.869 --> 01:01:14.666
You woke up the baby.

01:01:41.097 --> 01:01:43.964
Agent Hellboy,
take the shot!

01:01:44.033 --> 01:01:45.967
Right now! Take it!

01:01:46.035 --> 01:01:48.003
That's an order!
Take the shot.

01:01:48.137 --> 01:01:50.128
That's an order,
Agent Hellboy.

01:01:50.206 --> 01:01:54.802
Shoot it!
Shoot the gun! Shoot the gun!

01:01:58.381 --> 01:01:59.905
Demon.

01:02:00.183 --> 01:02:02.276
What are you waiting for?

01:02:02.418 --> 01:02:04.511
This is what you
wanted, isn't it?

01:02:04.587 --> 01:02:07.613
Look at it.
It's the last of its kind.

01:02:11.794 --> 01:02:14.490
Like you and I.
You destroy it,

01:02:14.564 --> 01:02:16.896
the world will never
see its like again.

01:02:21.037 --> 01:02:22.061
Shoot it!

01:02:22.138 --> 01:02:24.606
You have more in common
with us than with them.

01:02:24.674 --> 01:02:25.902
It's breaking free.

01:02:25.975 --> 01:02:27.499
You could be a king.

01:02:27.643 --> 01:02:29.167
You will not
disobey a direct order!

01:02:29.245 --> 01:02:31.008
Shoot it!
It's getting loose!

01:02:31.080 --> 01:02:32.206
If you cannot command...

01:02:32.281 --> 01:02:33.373
It will
destroy everything!

01:02:33.449 --> 01:02:34.643
That's an order,
Agent Hellboy!

01:02:34.717 --> 01:02:35.877
...then you must obey.

01:02:35.952 --> 01:02:37.817
Shoot it now!
Damn.

01:02:39.188 --> 01:02:40.450
Shoot it!

01:03:13.189 --> 01:03:16.955
Move back.
Step back, step back.

01:03:52.061 --> 01:03:54.052
It's beautiful.

01:04:16.786 --> 01:04:20.654
and this huge monster
just came out of nowhere!

01:04:29.465 --> 01:04:31.933
Yo, give the
baby back, man!

01:04:32.702 --> 01:04:35.500
Oh, what have you
done to my baby?

01:04:35.571 --> 01:04:36.595
The baby's fine.

01:04:36.672 --> 01:04:37.696
You freak!

01:04:37.773 --> 01:04:38.933
Hellboy,
what'd you do to that baby?

01:04:39.008 --> 01:04:40.270
The baby's fine.

01:04:40.343 --> 01:04:42.868
Don't move.
Hands in the air! Up!

01:04:42.945 --> 01:04:44.572
He's got a weapon
in his hand.

01:04:44.647 --> 01:04:46.615
That is his hand.

01:04:46.682 --> 01:04:49.446
Miss, stay away from him
for your own safety.

01:04:49.518 --> 01:04:51.611
He was trying to help.
Don't you see?

01:04:51.921 --> 01:04:53.980
He was just trying to help.

01:04:55.191 --> 01:04:57.386
That's all we do.

01:04:57.460 --> 01:04:58.927
That's all we've
done all these years.

01:04:58.995 --> 01:05:00.428
She's touching
his hand!

01:05:00.496 --> 01:05:03.659
We've just tried to
help you. You.

01:05:05.234 --> 01:05:07.168
You're a goddamn freak.

01:05:07.770 --> 01:05:09.761
We don't need
you around!

01:05:22.885 --> 01:05:24.375
What a freak.

01:05:24.487 --> 01:05:25.545
Liz.

01:05:33.296 --> 01:05:34.786
Let's go home.

01:05:37.667 --> 01:05:41.000
<i>... investigation of the BPRD and its
promotion of intra-species marriage</i>

01:05:41.070 --> 01:05:44.301
<i>seen by many as a threat</i>
<i>to traditional families,</i>

01:05:44.373 --> 01:05:46.204
<i>fuelled by federal funds.</i>

01:05:47.710 --> 01:05:49.610
I didn't touch you yet.

01:05:54.483 --> 01:05:56.678
You did a good job
out there.

01:05:57.853 --> 01:06:01.687
Then tell me, why
don't I feel so good?

01:06:01.757 --> 01:06:06.217
I mean, I killed that thing.
And for what?

01:06:07.964 --> 01:06:09.932
They don't even like me.

01:06:11.033 --> 01:06:12.830
I mean, they're afraid of me.

01:06:13.669 --> 01:06:15.432
What do we do with that?

01:06:15.805 --> 01:06:18.865
Red, I don't want
you to freak out.

01:06:21.077 --> 01:06:23.602
I'm gonna leave
for a little bit.

01:06:25.581 --> 01:06:27.412
I need time to think.

01:06:28.250 --> 01:06:29.740
About what?

01:06:29.819 --> 01:06:32.083
Can't you do your
thinking right here?

01:06:32.254 --> 01:06:34.188
Look, I'll be really,
really quiet.

01:06:34.256 --> 01:06:36.156
I'll get rid of the cats.

01:06:37.793 --> 01:06:39.818
Red, why are you with me?

01:06:40.796 --> 01:06:43.594
Do you need
everyone to like you?

01:06:43.666 --> 01:06:46.897
Everybody?
Or am I enough?

01:06:48.037 --> 01:06:49.561
Think about it.

01:06:57.947 --> 01:07:01.883
<i>You stay.</i>
<i>We belong dead.</i>

01:07:09.492 --> 01:07:12.359
It's blank.
No coordinates.

01:07:25.574 --> 01:07:28.236
"Be near me
when my light is low

01:07:28.310 --> 01:07:32.804
"When the blood creeps and
the nerves prick and tingle

01:07:32.882 --> 01:07:37.581
"And the heart is sick and
all the wheels of being slow

01:07:38.521 --> 01:07:44.323
"Be near me when the sensuous frame is
wracked with pangs that conquer trust

01:07:44.393 --> 01:07:46.384
"And time, a maniac..."

01:07:46.462 --> 01:07:49.556
Tennyson, "In Memoriam."
A beautiful poem.

01:07:49.632 --> 01:07:51.293
Forgive me, I didn't
mean to startle you.

01:07:51.367 --> 01:07:53.597
Oh, no. No, no.
I borrowed this book.

01:07:53.669 --> 01:07:54.727
I hope you don't mind.

01:07:54.804 --> 01:07:57.773
Oh, no, no. Please,
this is your home now.

01:07:57.840 --> 01:07:59.102
You are safe here.

01:07:59.175 --> 01:08:01.735
My brother will find me.
He always does.

01:08:01.811 --> 01:08:02.937
How could he?

01:08:03.012 --> 01:08:04.502
Our location is a highly
classified secret.

01:08:04.580 --> 01:08:07.208
Yes, but I know of it now,
which means that he does, too.

01:08:07.283 --> 01:08:08.580
We're twins.

01:08:08.651 --> 01:08:12.212
Even as children, a link has
bound us one to the other.

01:08:13.389 --> 01:08:14.651
Something I cannot explain.

01:08:15.124 --> 01:08:16.318
No need.

01:08:19.194 --> 01:08:20.560
You look different.

01:08:20.629 --> 01:08:21.926
Oh, do I?

01:08:21.997 --> 01:08:23.191
Perhaps my hair?

01:08:23.265 --> 01:08:24.390
No.

01:08:24.466 --> 01:08:27.800
It's your eyes.
I can see your eyes.

01:08:27.870 --> 01:08:32.136
Yes. Just trying
a new look.

01:08:36.545 --> 01:08:38.069
Is that a map?

01:08:39.715 --> 01:08:41.615
Yes, it was in the cylinder.

01:08:41.750 --> 01:08:43.684
There are no coordinates.

01:08:47.423 --> 01:08:49.653
Perhaps there's
a watermark.

01:08:52.661 --> 01:08:55.653
You were very brave
vouching for me.

01:08:55.731 --> 01:08:59.029
How do you know I'm not
the enemy, bringing me here?

01:09:00.136 --> 01:09:02.194
It's as you were
saying just now.

01:09:02.270 --> 01:09:06.799
From intuition maybe,
a link.

01:09:09.745 --> 01:09:12.805
Normally I'm able to
read others quite quickly,

01:09:13.849 --> 01:09:16.283
but I've never met
anyone like you.

01:09:18.821 --> 01:09:20.412
Nor I, like you.

01:09:23.658 --> 01:09:25.593
Good night, Abraham.

01:09:25.661 --> 01:09:27.185
Good night, Princess.
Your Highness.

01:09:27.263 --> 01:09:29.094
Your Majesty.
Your... Ma'am.

01:09:29.698 --> 01:09:30.858
Ma'am?

01:10:03.666 --> 01:10:05.759
<i>Gute Nacht,</i>
Agent Hellboy.

01:10:09.905 --> 01:10:12.703
Look, Agent,
I know you don't like me,

01:10:12.775 --> 01:10:14.504
but I could take
away your badge.

01:10:14.577 --> 01:10:16.477
Never had one.

01:10:16.545 --> 01:10:18.706
Kept asking, though.

01:10:18.781 --> 01:10:20.976
You will learn to
obey me, follow protocol

01:10:21.050 --> 01:10:23.177
and stay fockused
at all times.

01:10:23.252 --> 01:10:25.777
Oh, that word "fockused."

01:10:25.854 --> 01:10:28.948
Yeah, with your accent,
I wouldn't use it that much.

01:10:29.024 --> 01:10:31.015
I knew Professor Broom,
young man.

01:10:31.093 --> 01:10:32.321
You didn't know
Professor Broom.

01:10:32.394 --> 01:10:33.554
Yes, I did.

01:10:33.629 --> 01:10:34.994
After my accident...
Shut up. Shut up.

01:10:35.064 --> 01:10:36.691
...he designed
this containment suit.

01:10:36.765 --> 01:10:38.357
A wonderful man.

01:10:38.434 --> 01:10:39.833
And even then he was worried
about your future. He...

01:10:39.902 --> 01:10:41.767
Hey, Gas Bag, stop it!

01:10:43.606 --> 01:10:44.630
Right now.

01:10:44.707 --> 01:10:46.971
Or what?
Are you threatening me?

01:10:47.176 --> 01:10:49.508
Because I think
I can take you.

01:10:52.014 --> 01:10:53.140
Excuse me?

01:10:53.282 --> 01:10:54.510
You heard me.

01:10:57.152 --> 01:11:00.246
I couldn't hear you
from all the way over there.

01:11:00.322 --> 01:11:04.088
I can take you because
you have one fatal flaw.

01:11:05.127 --> 01:11:06.219
Oh, I wanna hear it.

01:11:06.295 --> 01:11:08.627
No, you don't.
You can't take criticism.

01:11:08.697 --> 01:11:10.392
Try me.

01:11:10.532 --> 01:11:12.227
Can't take it.

01:11:14.703 --> 01:11:16.568
What's my flaw?

01:11:16.639 --> 01:11:19.540
Your temper.
It gets the best of you.

01:11:19.642 --> 01:11:22.236
Makes you weak.
Makes you vulnerable.

01:11:26.348 --> 01:11:27.337
Oh, crap.

01:11:28.517 --> 01:11:29.677
Johann.

01:11:34.690 --> 01:11:37.488
Johann? Johann?

01:11:39.762 --> 01:11:41.457
Hey, Johann?

01:11:45.901 --> 01:11:48.335
Come on, pal.
Hang in there, will you?

01:11:48.404 --> 01:11:50.770
Johann? Johann?

01:11:54.943 --> 01:11:55.932
Damn.

01:12:00.115 --> 01:12:01.104
Ow!

01:12:39.288 --> 01:12:40.653
There we are.

01:12:40.723 --> 01:12:42.281
Your temper,
it makes you sloppy.

01:12:42.358 --> 01:12:44.326
Try to control it,
Agent Hellboy.

01:12:44.393 --> 01:12:46.293
Before it controls you.

01:12:54.737 --> 01:12:56.068
Glasshole.

01:13:03.178 --> 01:13:04.167
Mmm.

01:13:10.185 --> 01:13:11.174
Huh?

01:13:27.603 --> 01:13:28.592
Hello, Red.

01:13:28.670 --> 01:13:29.898
Well, you're up late.

01:13:29.972 --> 01:13:31.166
What are you listening to?

01:13:31.240 --> 01:13:34.232
Vivaldi.
<i>Il cimento dell'armonia.</i>

01:13:34.309 --> 01:13:35.674
I particularly
like the last...

01:13:35.744 --> 01:13:37.075
Hey, hey. What's that?

01:13:37.146 --> 01:13:38.807
Just a remote.

01:13:41.316 --> 01:13:43.147
This? Yes.

01:13:45.354 --> 01:13:47.288
<i>"Popular Love Songs."</i>

01:13:50.492 --> 01:13:51.686
Oh, Abe.

01:13:52.761 --> 01:13:55.229
You fell for the Princess.

01:13:55.831 --> 01:13:58.425
She's... She's like me.

01:13:58.500 --> 01:14:00.832
A creature from
another world.

01:14:02.337 --> 01:14:04.771
You need to get out more.

01:14:04.840 --> 01:14:07.809
She's alone in the world.
I wanna help her.

01:14:07.876 --> 01:14:10.071
I need to care for her.

01:14:12.114 --> 01:14:14.412
You're in love.
Have a beer.

01:14:14.483 --> 01:14:15.472
Oh, my body's a temple.

01:14:15.551 --> 01:14:16.609
Well, now it's an
amusement park.

01:14:16.685 --> 01:14:17.674
No, no, no.

01:14:17.753 --> 01:14:18.742
The glandular balance of...

01:14:18.821 --> 01:14:21.016
Just shut up and
drink it, would you?

01:14:23.759 --> 01:14:25.852
What track?
Eight.

01:14:25.928 --> 01:14:28.488
<i>Can't Smile Without You.</i>

01:14:28.564 --> 01:14:29.895
I know.

01:14:30.032 --> 01:14:31.966
Yep, I'm gonna need
a beer, too.

01:14:32.034 --> 01:14:34.298
Well, see, I love this song.

01:14:34.369 --> 01:14:36.997
And I can't smile or cry.

01:14:37.072 --> 01:14:39.370
I think I have
no tear ducts.

01:14:42.244 --> 01:14:44.769
I wish Father were here.

01:14:44.847 --> 01:14:47.907
He'd know what to tell
you. Us.

01:14:55.858 --> 01:15:00.192
<i>I can't smile without you</i>

01:15:00.295 --> 01:15:04.891
<i>I can't laugh</i>
<i>and I can't sing</i>

01:15:05.567 --> 01:15:09.298
<i>I'm finding it hard</i>

01:15:09.371 --> 01:15:15.276
<i>You see,</i>
<i>I feel sad when you're sad</i>

01:15:15.944 --> 01:15:20.313
<i>I feel glad when you're glad</i>

01:15:20.382 --> 01:15:25.183
<i>If you only knew</i>
<i>what I'm going through</i>

01:15:26.288 --> 01:15:33.023
<i>I just can't</i>

01:15:35.230 --> 01:15:37.425
<i>You came along</i>

01:15:37.499 --> 01:15:39.729
<i>Just like a song</i>

01:15:39.801 --> 01:15:43.032
<i>And brightened my day</i>

01:15:43.105 --> 01:15:47.405
<i>Who'd have believed that

01:15:47.476 --> 01:15:52.812
<i>Now it all seems</i>

01:15:52.881 --> 01:15:59.047
<i>And now you know I can't</i>

01:16:00.255 --> 01:16:04.214
<i>I can't smile without you</i>

01:16:05.727 --> 01:16:07.194
<i>Nuala.</i>

01:16:17.439 --> 01:16:18.701
Good dog.

01:16:29.418 --> 01:16:32.546
<i>Security detail</i>
<i>for the front gate, immediately.</i>

01:16:51.440 --> 01:16:53.203
It's the last one.

01:16:58.447 --> 01:17:01.883
Look at her.
She's it, Abe.

01:17:02.484 --> 01:17:03.473
She's it.

01:17:03.619 --> 01:17:05.553
She's my whole wide...

01:17:07.856 --> 01:17:08.845
You know?

01:17:10.492 --> 01:17:12.517
Yeah. Yeah.

01:17:12.594 --> 01:17:14.994
I would give
my life for her.

01:17:16.698 --> 01:17:19.428
But she also wants me
to do the dishes.

01:17:20.802 --> 01:17:24.169
I would die
and do the dishes.

01:17:24.239 --> 01:17:26.230
Why is she mad at me?

01:17:26.308 --> 01:17:27.935
It's not because
the room is dirty.

01:17:28.010 --> 01:17:29.568
Something else.

01:17:30.646 --> 01:17:33.137
Well, ask her, then.

01:17:33.215 --> 01:17:35.115
No.

01:17:35.384 --> 01:17:36.749
Listen, Abe.

01:17:36.818 --> 01:17:37.807
Yeah.

01:17:37.886 --> 01:17:39.820
When a woman's
mad about something,

01:17:39.888 --> 01:17:41.788
but she's really mad
about something else,

01:17:41.857 --> 01:17:45.691
you can't ask because then they
get angry because you had to ask.

01:17:45.761 --> 01:17:47.194
Do you know what I mean?

01:17:47.262 --> 01:17:49.628
Never mind,
don't answer that question.

01:17:49.698 --> 01:17:51.393
You gotta just...

01:17:52.267 --> 01:17:53.359
Yeah.

01:17:54.369 --> 01:17:55.529
...find out.

01:18:02.577 --> 01:18:04.374
Very quick of you.
The parchment.

01:18:04.446 --> 01:18:06.209
It was of no importance.

01:18:06.782 --> 01:18:10.980
The cylinder is
very interesting.

01:18:16.058 --> 01:18:18.492
We will find
the Golden Army here.

01:18:20.395 --> 01:18:23.558
As for the crown piece,
I know it's here.

01:18:25.901 --> 01:18:28.495
I can feel that
much from you.

01:18:29.905 --> 01:18:33.602
Father always tried so hard
to shield your heart from mine.

01:18:37.079 --> 01:18:40.242
But it's in one of the books,
and I will find it.

01:18:40.682 --> 01:18:41.876
Blue.

01:18:42.317 --> 01:18:44.979
You always look
so beautiful in blue.

01:18:46.388 --> 01:18:47.514
Blue.

01:18:48.557 --> 01:18:50.752
Poetry. "Love.

01:18:51.827 --> 01:18:54.523
"Found then lost."

01:18:56.098 --> 01:18:58.589
Only words.
I will find it.

01:19:00.502 --> 01:19:02.060
Listen, listen, Red.

01:19:02.137 --> 01:19:05.538
I know what's
going on with Liz.

01:19:05.607 --> 01:19:07.040
Red.

01:19:07.109 --> 01:19:08.633
Abe.

01:19:10.078 --> 01:19:11.238
I'm sorry.
He has to know.

01:19:11.313 --> 01:19:12.405
Abe!

01:19:12.481 --> 01:19:13.846
Know what?

01:19:19.221 --> 01:19:20.518
Why?

01:19:20.589 --> 01:19:22.420
Stay back.
I'll go first.

01:19:22.491 --> 01:19:26.018
Abraham. No, don't...
He'll kill you.

01:19:26.094 --> 01:19:27.459
Princess?

01:19:27.529 --> 01:19:28.894
Abraham?

01:19:30.899 --> 01:19:32.298
No!

01:19:32.434 --> 01:19:34.163
I will kill you, Abraham.

01:19:35.604 --> 01:19:38.072
And anyone else
if that is necessary.

01:19:40.242 --> 01:19:41.504
Well?

01:19:42.744 --> 01:19:47.807
Then why don't you just start
with me, Your Royal Assness?

01:19:47.883 --> 01:19:49.316
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:19:49.384 --> 01:19:50.783
Who put those there?

01:19:50.852 --> 01:19:52.444
And your weapon of choice?

01:19:52.521 --> 01:19:55.012
Five-fingered Mary.

01:19:55.090 --> 01:19:58.355
You move and I'll kill
your Abraham first.

01:20:09.571 --> 01:20:11.129
Red, you mustn't
harm the Prince.

01:20:11.206 --> 01:20:12.332
What?

01:20:12.407 --> 01:20:15.137
If you hurt him,
you hurt the Princess.

01:20:16.545 --> 01:20:18.843
You've gotta be kidding me.

01:20:23.885 --> 01:20:25.011
Will you give me
the crown piece?

01:20:25.086 --> 01:20:26.348
No.

01:20:36.331 --> 01:20:37.992
The piece.
No.

01:21:08.230 --> 01:21:09.219
Abe?

01:21:09.297 --> 01:21:10.559
Red, I'm so sorry,
but they're linked.

01:21:10.632 --> 01:21:11.860
What's going on?

01:21:11.933 --> 01:21:13.491
Red.
Liz.

01:21:13.568 --> 01:21:15.331
Red, behind you.

01:21:17.472 --> 01:21:20.839
You may have mused in the past,
"Am I mortal?"

01:21:26.448 --> 01:21:27.847
You are now.

01:21:34.456 --> 01:21:38.187
Abraham, many people
have died for this crown.

01:21:39.761 --> 01:21:41.558
He will, too.

01:21:42.797 --> 01:21:47.666
If you want to save him
and see her again,

01:21:48.737 --> 01:21:52.298
you will find the missing
piece and bring it to me.

01:22:29.110 --> 01:22:31.578
Jesus, Abe, pull the
damn thing out!

01:22:31.646 --> 01:22:32.874
I cannot.

01:22:32.948 --> 01:22:36.315
Every time I touch it, every
time I come close to it,

01:22:36.384 --> 01:22:38.352
it moves closer
to his heart.

01:22:38.420 --> 01:22:40.149
I don't know
what else to do.

01:22:40.221 --> 01:22:43.520
The wound will not heal
until the spear is removed.

01:22:45.860 --> 01:22:47.225
We're running out of time.

01:22:47.295 --> 01:22:49.126
Then we go after the Prince.

01:22:50.565 --> 01:22:52.795
And we make him
take it out.

01:22:54.736 --> 01:22:56.067
Hey, Liz.

01:22:56.471 --> 01:22:57.631
You were asking me.

01:22:57.706 --> 01:22:58.832
Don't talk.

01:22:58.907 --> 01:23:00.465
No, no, let me tell you.

01:23:00.542 --> 01:23:02.237
I know what's important.

01:23:04.179 --> 01:23:05.237
It's you.

01:23:05.313 --> 01:23:06.746
Red.

01:23:07.248 --> 01:23:10.445
I could turn my back
on the world, all of it,

01:23:13.621 --> 01:23:15.316
as long as you stay with me.

01:23:15.390 --> 01:23:17.187
I'll stay with you.

01:23:17.993 --> 01:23:20.461
You're the best man
I've ever met.

01:23:25.867 --> 01:23:26.856
"Man."

01:23:53.862 --> 01:23:56.330
<i>"Be near me</i>
<i>when my light is low</i>

01:23:56.398 --> 01:23:57.831
<i>" When the blood creeps</i>

01:23:57.899 --> 01:24:02.893
<i>"And the heart is sick and
all the wheels of being slow"</i>

01:24:09.444 --> 01:24:11.105
The cylinder
yielded coordinates

01:24:11.179 --> 01:24:13.306
to County Antrim,
Northern Ireland.

01:24:13.748 --> 01:24:16.911
The Giant's Causeway.
Right about here.

01:24:18.586 --> 01:24:20.383
Great. So we know
where he is.

01:24:20.455 --> 01:24:21.479
What are we waiting for?

01:24:21.556 --> 01:24:22.648
We should get going.

01:24:22.724 --> 01:24:25.625
The Prince will demand the
crown piece, Agent Sherman.

01:24:25.693 --> 01:24:27.354
So we give it to him.

01:24:27.429 --> 01:24:28.828
Dr. Manning?

01:24:28.897 --> 01:24:31.525
I'm afraid it's not
as simple as that.

01:24:32.233 --> 01:24:33.495
Hold on here,
what are you saying?

01:24:33.568 --> 01:24:35.900
The Golden Army
must not awaken.

01:24:37.038 --> 01:24:38.630
So, what?

01:24:38.706 --> 01:24:41.072
You're just gonna let
him die, is that it?

01:24:41.142 --> 01:24:42.200
I'm sorry.

01:24:42.277 --> 01:24:44.677
We called Washington.
We have our orders.

01:24:45.780 --> 01:24:48.044
And what about you?
He saved your life.

01:24:48.116 --> 01:24:49.674
I know.

01:24:52.787 --> 01:24:54.778
I know this is
difficult for you, but...

01:24:54.856 --> 01:24:56.517
Well, I won't
let him die.

01:24:56.591 --> 01:24:58.320
Agent Sherman,
may I remind you

01:24:58.393 --> 01:25:01.362
that I am the leader
of this team.

01:25:01.429 --> 01:25:03.158
Oh, there's no doubt
about that, sir.

01:25:03.231 --> 01:25:05.165
That is what you
are, Dr. Krauss.

01:25:05.233 --> 01:25:09.101
And if ever you were human,
that time is long gone.

01:25:10.605 --> 01:25:12.573
What's wrong
with her?

01:25:12.640 --> 01:25:13.800
You want me to
call her back, sir?

01:25:13.875 --> 01:25:15.103
Let her go.

01:25:15.310 --> 01:25:16.743
I understand.

01:25:17.712 --> 01:25:19.509
What about you?

01:25:19.581 --> 01:25:21.014
You find anything?

01:25:21.082 --> 01:25:22.481
No. Nothing yet.

01:25:22.550 --> 01:25:24.017
Well, keep looking.

01:25:24.085 --> 01:25:25.484
Absolutely, sir.

01:25:25.553 --> 01:25:27.282
All of you.

01:25:27.355 --> 01:25:30.256
But don't worry, sir, we know
it's here, and we're gonna find it.

01:25:30.325 --> 01:25:32.418
When Tom Manning gets on
the case, things get done.

01:25:32.494 --> 01:25:34.724
They get done.
They get done!

01:25:35.296 --> 01:25:38.231
100%. I guarantee that.

01:25:53.982 --> 01:25:58.112
Even without the piece, we
have to get him out of here.

01:25:58.186 --> 01:26:01.053
We'll go to Antrim, and
we will find the Prince.

01:26:01.122 --> 01:26:02.316
Keep looking.

01:26:02.390 --> 01:26:03.414
I ask you, everybody,
keep looking.

01:26:03.491 --> 01:26:04.480
Abe.

01:26:08.096 --> 01:26:09.927
Just the two of us.

01:26:10.632 --> 01:26:12.463
Yes. Yes.

01:26:13.101 --> 01:26:14.398
Let's go.

01:26:30.685 --> 01:26:34.086
We need to leave now, before
they run our clearance upstairs.

01:26:34.222 --> 01:26:36.622
<i>Guten Abend,</i>
<i>meine Freunde.</i>

01:26:36.691 --> 01:26:39.251
Do you have authorization
to take that plane?

01:26:40.662 --> 01:26:42.721
You're not gonna
stop us, Johann.

01:26:42.797 --> 01:26:45.265
On the contrary,
I've been giving it some thought,

01:26:45.333 --> 01:26:48.302
and we should be able
to save Agent Hellboy.

01:26:49.137 --> 01:26:52.698
You say I'm not human anymore,
but you are wrong.

01:26:52.774 --> 01:26:55.402
I understand your
pain all too well.

01:26:55.476 --> 01:26:58.445
A long time ago,
I lost the woman I loved.

01:26:58.513 --> 01:27:02.074
And that was, in fact, the
source of my present misfortune.

01:27:02.150 --> 01:27:03.777
I will tell you
about it one day.

01:27:03.851 --> 01:27:06.786
But for now, the tactical
advantage is ours.

01:27:06.854 --> 01:27:09.687
Consider this, the Prince
lacks the crown piece

01:27:09.757 --> 01:27:12.351
and without it, his
army poses no threat.

01:27:12.427 --> 01:27:13.860
So we have clearance, then?

01:27:13.928 --> 01:27:17.557
Agent Sherman, Liz,
screw the clearance.

01:27:18.233 --> 01:27:20.201
We will take that plane!

01:27:44.192 --> 01:27:45.887
It should be here someplace.

01:27:45.960 --> 01:27:49.987
The entrance should be here.

01:27:50.064 --> 01:27:51.429
I don't understand.

01:27:51.499 --> 01:27:54.059
Perhaps there's
a mistake on the map.

01:27:59.374 --> 01:28:00.864
Hello there!

01:28:02.910 --> 01:28:04.502
I bid you welcome, strangers.

01:28:04.579 --> 01:28:06.103
How can I be of assistance?

01:28:06.180 --> 01:28:08.273
We seek safe
passage to Bethmoora.

01:28:08.916 --> 01:28:11.885
And what does a nice little girl
like you want in the nightlands?

01:28:11.953 --> 01:28:13.784
We are looking
for Prince Nuada.

01:28:13.855 --> 01:28:15.322
Him, I know.

01:28:15.390 --> 01:28:17.551
Trade me something,
and I'll take you to him.

01:28:17.625 --> 01:28:19.957
Here. I have a shiny belt.

01:28:20.094 --> 01:28:22.460
But I have no pants.

01:28:22.530 --> 01:28:25.556
Look, a wonderful
set of magic eyes.

01:28:25.633 --> 01:28:27.658
I already have binoculars.

01:28:28.703 --> 01:28:33.663
But I see something special,
something shiny underneath the bandages.

01:28:33.741 --> 01:28:35.208
I want that.

01:28:35.276 --> 01:28:36.903
No, you can't take it out.

01:28:36.978 --> 01:28:39.003
Not without killing him.

01:28:40.481 --> 01:28:42.244
Maybe I know someone
who can.

01:28:42.317 --> 01:28:44.046
Will you trade me then?

01:28:49.824 --> 01:28:51.018
All right.

01:28:51.092 --> 01:28:52.320
Very well.

01:30:04.232 --> 01:30:06.132
Keep going. Keep going.

01:30:20.281 --> 01:30:21.976
Oh, my God.

01:30:33.961 --> 01:30:37.158
You should have seen
this city when it was alive.

01:30:39.534 --> 01:30:40.933
What happened to it?

01:30:41.002 --> 01:30:41.991
Curse.

01:30:42.069 --> 01:30:44.333
As soon as the Golden
Army was stored here,

01:30:44.405 --> 01:30:46.896
a plague of silence
and death befell us.

01:30:46.974 --> 01:30:49.272
And the world left us behind.

01:30:56.484 --> 01:30:59.419
For a long time,
I alone dwelled in the dust.

01:31:02.690 --> 01:31:06.683
All right, little girl,
the two of you come inside.

01:31:06.761 --> 01:31:09.059
The rest of you,
wait out here.

01:31:24.879 --> 01:31:26.244
Hello, old friend.

01:31:26.314 --> 01:31:28.145
I have brought you visitors.

01:31:31.552 --> 01:31:34.544
And I have
a favor to ask you.

01:31:34.622 --> 01:31:38.319
I owe no favor to
you, goblin. Leave.

01:31:38.392 --> 01:31:40.383
But I have done
so much for you.

01:31:40.528 --> 01:31:42.621
I have brought
you many souvenirs.

01:31:43.531 --> 01:31:45.658
And he has something shiny.

01:31:45.733 --> 01:31:46.893
Red.

01:31:46.968 --> 01:31:48.094
Something mine.

01:31:48.169 --> 01:31:49.158
Red!

01:31:54.542 --> 01:31:57.204
Anung un Rama.

01:31:57.278 --> 01:31:58.336
You know that name?

01:31:58.412 --> 01:32:03.111
And yours.
Elizabeth Sherman.

01:32:08.856 --> 01:32:11.586
At last.

01:32:11.692 --> 01:32:17.653
I have been waiting for
you both many a winter moon.

01:32:20.201 --> 01:32:23.796
I am his death,

01:32:23.871 --> 01:32:28.740
and I will meet him
at each crossroads.

01:32:28.809 --> 01:32:31.744
Good. But when can I have
that which is mine?

01:32:32.947 --> 01:32:34.312
Can you save him?

01:32:34.382 --> 01:32:36.873
It is for you to decide that.

01:32:36.951 --> 01:32:38.885
It is all the same to me.

01:32:38.953 --> 01:32:44.084
My heart is filled
with dust and sand,

01:32:44.158 --> 01:32:48.458
but you should know
it is his destiny

01:32:49.630 --> 01:32:52.793
to bring about the
destruction of the Earth.

01:32:53.868 --> 01:33:00.296
Not now, not tomorrow,
but soon enough.

01:33:05.012 --> 01:33:10.382
Knowing that, you still
want him to live?

01:33:19.126 --> 01:33:23.529
So, child, make the choice.

01:33:23.598 --> 01:33:27.159
The world or him?

01:33:27.802 --> 01:33:28.928
Him.

01:33:30.771 --> 01:33:35.435
The time will come
and you, my dear,

01:33:35.509 --> 01:33:38.774
will suffer more than anyone.

01:33:38.846 --> 01:33:40.643
I'll deal with it.

01:33:42.416 --> 01:33:43.906
Now save him.

01:33:43.985 --> 01:33:47.546
It is done.

01:33:52.426 --> 01:33:54.690
I have done what I can.

01:33:54.795 --> 01:33:59.789
Now, give him
a reason to live.

01:34:04.605 --> 01:34:09.008
Hey, friend, what
about that which is mine?

01:34:09.076 --> 01:34:12.807
Don't forget about me.
What about me?

01:34:12.880 --> 01:34:14.211
Friend?

01:34:24.492 --> 01:34:25.652
Shiny.

01:34:31.065 --> 01:34:34.262
Listen to me, you big ape.

01:34:36.170 --> 01:34:38.468
You have to get up.

01:34:41.242 --> 01:34:43.005
You have to get up.

01:34:45.713 --> 01:34:48.113
'Cause you're
gonna be a father.

01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:07.661
I become

01:35:10.304 --> 01:35:11.293
father?

01:35:23.451 --> 01:35:26.249
Well, all this is
very touching,

01:35:26.320 --> 01:35:31.314
but if you still want to meet
Nuada, we have to leave now.

01:35:32.193 --> 01:35:33.217
Ready.

01:35:41.268 --> 01:35:42.633
Here we are.

01:35:44.238 --> 01:35:46.638
And there they are.

01:35:46.707 --> 01:35:50.040
Seventy times 70 soldiers.

01:35:50.611 --> 01:35:53.637
Sometimes I wish
I'd never created them.

01:35:53.714 --> 01:35:55.306
Bim-bam went the hammers!

01:35:55.382 --> 01:35:57.043
Whoosh went the furnaces!

01:35:57.118 --> 01:36:00.713
And one of those fires
took my legs off, now.

01:36:00.821 --> 01:36:03.654
This is as far as I can go.

01:36:03.724 --> 01:36:06.284
I'm not very
good with steps.

01:36:06.360 --> 01:36:11.229
But if you're here to stop him,
the Prince, I wish you luck then.

01:36:11.298 --> 01:36:13.289
The Golden Army
must not awaken.

01:36:13.367 --> 01:36:14.561
Undo what we did.

01:36:14.635 --> 01:36:15.624
We will.

01:36:35.022 --> 01:36:36.182
You're here.

01:36:36.257 --> 01:36:38.418
So I assume you brought
the remaining piece.

01:36:38.492 --> 01:36:40.323
No. We didn't,
but we should discuss...

01:36:40.394 --> 01:36:42.692
I'm not addressing you,
Tin Man.

01:36:43.764 --> 01:36:44.856
Abraham.

01:36:44.932 --> 01:36:46.024
Abraham?

01:36:46.100 --> 01:36:47.294
My sister is well
as I promised, so...

01:36:47.368 --> 01:36:49.063
Abe?

01:36:52.039 --> 01:36:54.200
What the hell are you doing?

01:36:54.341 --> 01:36:56.502
You would do
the exact same for Liz.

01:36:56.577 --> 01:36:58.238
Agent Sapien, no!

01:37:20.601 --> 01:37:24.093
I am Prince Nuada,
Silverlance,

01:37:24.171 --> 01:37:26.196
leader of the Golden Army.

01:37:27.741 --> 01:37:30.938
Is there anyone here
who would dispute my right?

01:38:50.124 --> 01:38:51.216
Kill them.

01:38:51.292 --> 01:38:52.384
But...

01:38:53.794 --> 01:38:55.318
He lied to us.

01:38:57.298 --> 01:39:00.995
Abe, old buddy, if we ever
get out of this, we gotta talk.

01:39:29.229 --> 01:39:30.560
Open wide!

01:39:40.274 --> 01:39:42.299
Industrable, my ass.

01:40:22.383 --> 01:40:24.647
Hey! Throw me a bone here!

01:42:04.284 --> 01:42:05.615
Oh, crap.

01:42:08.956 --> 01:42:10.856
Well,
I'm out of ideas.

01:42:19.099 --> 01:42:20.623
I got one.

01:42:20.701 --> 01:42:24.569
I challenge Prince Nuada

01:42:26.073 --> 01:42:29.736
for the right to
command this army.

01:42:35.549 --> 01:42:37.881
You challenge me?

01:42:37.951 --> 01:42:39.475
Who are you
to challenge me?

01:42:39.553 --> 01:42:41.020
You are nobody.

01:42:41.889 --> 01:42:43.356
You are not royalty.

01:42:43.423 --> 01:42:47.689
Yes. Yes! He is Anung un Rama,
son of the Fallen One.

01:42:47.761 --> 01:42:48.819
He has the right.

01:42:48.896 --> 01:42:50.727
A challenge must
be answered.

01:42:54.368 --> 01:42:55.858
Very well then.

01:42:55.936 --> 01:42:57.130
Red, please.
Red. Think about it.

01:42:57.204 --> 01:42:58.193
Guys. Guys!
He will kill you.

01:42:58.272 --> 01:43:00.035
Don't do this, Red.

01:43:00.807 --> 01:43:02.934
Don't worry, babe.

01:43:03.010 --> 01:43:05.240
I'm not gonna kill him, Abe.

01:43:05.879 --> 01:43:07.870
But I am gonna
kick his ass.

01:44:38.839 --> 01:44:39.828
Whoa!

01:45:15.442 --> 01:45:16.534
Red.

01:45:18.178 --> 01:45:19.167
Hey!

01:45:27.521 --> 01:45:28.818
Nice ride, huh?

01:46:08.829 --> 01:46:11.059
You jumpy, slippery bastard.

01:46:12.299 --> 01:46:13.561
I got you now.

01:46:23.210 --> 01:46:26.805
Kill me. You must,
for I will not stop.

01:46:26.880 --> 01:46:28.472
I cannot.
Sorry, pal.

01:46:29.850 --> 01:46:31.010
I win.

01:46:31.985 --> 01:46:33.213
You live.

01:47:04.050 --> 01:47:05.210
Nuala.

01:47:33.680 --> 01:47:35.011
The humans,

01:47:37.717 --> 01:47:40.049
they will tire of you.

01:47:40.120 --> 01:47:41.951
They have already
turned against you.

01:47:42.456 --> 01:47:43.616
Leave them.

01:47:45.192 --> 01:47:47.854
Is it them or us?

01:47:51.031 --> 01:47:53.431
Which holocaust
should be chosen?

01:48:04.678 --> 01:48:08.580
I never had a chance
to tell you how I felt.

01:48:09.850 --> 01:48:11.511
Give me your hand.

01:48:22.562 --> 01:48:24.154
It's beautiful.

01:48:25.265 --> 01:48:26.596
We die

01:48:28.802 --> 01:48:31.430
and the world will
be poorer for it.

01:48:45.519 --> 01:48:47.714
Nuala, my sister.

01:49:31.665 --> 01:49:32.757
All that power.

01:49:32.832 --> 01:49:34.561
Don't even think about it.

01:50:23.850 --> 01:50:25.408
No. No, it's nothing.

01:50:25.485 --> 01:50:27.316
I told you,
it's a dead end.

01:50:27.754 --> 01:50:30.120
What are you doing?
Go away.

01:50:30.190 --> 01:50:32.090
Check the belt locator.

01:50:33.193 --> 01:50:35.855
Check the belt locators,
over there.

01:50:37.764 --> 01:50:39.254
Over there.

01:50:42.936 --> 01:50:46.201
You, you took that plane without
an authorization, young man.

01:50:46.272 --> 01:50:48.934
Hey. Manning.

01:50:49.042 --> 01:50:51.135
Here to help as always.

01:50:51.211 --> 01:50:53.611
What's going on?
What's going on?

01:50:54.381 --> 01:50:55.609
I quit.

01:50:56.583 --> 01:50:57.982
What? Are you serious?

01:50:58.051 --> 01:50:59.416
Looks that way,
doesn't it?

01:50:59.486 --> 01:51:02.319
What's wrong with you?
You can't all just quit.

01:51:02.389 --> 01:51:03.720
Watch us.

01:51:05.492 --> 01:51:07.153
On second thought,

01:51:08.862 --> 01:51:10.489
I think I'll keep this.

01:51:12.132 --> 01:51:14.362
Come on. Come on!

01:51:15.669 --> 01:51:18.467
Johann, they can't do this.
Stop them.

01:51:18.538 --> 01:51:21.974
Dr. Manning, suck my
ectoplasmic schwanzstucker.

01:51:22.709 --> 01:51:24.006
So what you said before,

01:51:24.077 --> 01:51:25.442
about us living anywhere.

01:51:25.512 --> 01:51:26.672
Guys. Guys!

01:51:26.746 --> 01:51:28.873
Anywhere. You and me.
- Come on back.

01:51:28.948 --> 01:51:29.972
Let's find a place
in the country.

01:51:30.050 --> 01:51:31.210
I said come on back.

01:51:31.284 --> 01:51:33.309
Clean air.
Green hills.

01:51:34.254 --> 01:51:37.815
A yard with lots
of room to grow in.

01:51:37.891 --> 01:51:39.007
It'll be great for the baby.

01:51:39.292 --> 01:51:40.520
Babies.

01:54:40.521 --> 01:54:41.521
