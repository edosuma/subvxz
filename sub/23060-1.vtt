It's called "Scouter Stories."

10:35.384 --> 10:37.136
Great excuse for me and Leahto get out

10:37.219 --> 10:39.930
and chase down adventuresall over the city. Pretty cool.

10:39.972 --> 10:42.516
But, right now,I have a new editor, and, um

10:42.516 --> 10:44.852
she wants to use the spacefor ad sales, so I'm like..

10:44.977 --> 10:46.354
If you see beads of sweaton my forehead

10:46.354 --> 10:48.481
it's because I've gotwriter's block and a deadline

10:48.564 --> 10:50.358
for a great Christmas storythis week.

10:50.399 --> 10:51.525
I totally get it.

10:51.650 --> 10:52.818
If I miss a deadline, 300 people

10:52.860 --> 10:54.195
might miss their vacations.

10:54.278 --> 10:58.449
Right. I'm sorry aboutthe whole Bali situation.

10:58.532 --> 10:59.367
Oh, no. It's fine.

10:59.367 --> 11:00.868
I'm sure I can fly out tomorrow

11:00.993 --> 11:02.828
with a few creative connections.

11:02.912 --> 11:04.705
Ah, Christmasin Bali, that's..

11:04.830 --> 11:06.165
- Yeah.- It's cool, but, um..

11:06.248 --> 11:08.542
Are you gonna missa regular Christmas?

11:08.668 --> 11:10.169
Oh, gosh. Not a chance.

11:10.211 --> 11:11.879
No. It's the best timeto travel.

11:12.004 --> 11:14.715
Christmas day,the airports are a breeze.

11:14.757 --> 11:16.509
But caroling and..

11:16.592 --> 11:19.637
...snowball fightsand snow, I mean..

11:19.720 --> 11:21.430
Come on.

11:21.555 --> 11:24.517
I guess Christmasjust isn't really

11:24.558 --> 11:25.810
that big of a deal to me.

11:25.851 --> 11:28.729
And I like how no two daysare ever the same.

11:28.813 --> 11:31.190
I like two days the same,if they're good days.

11:31.273 --> 11:34.860
But don't you miss, like,adventure..

11:34.944 --> 11:36.153
Oh, I think I've gotenough adventure

11:36.237 --> 11:37.822
with this little monkey here.

11:37.905 --> 11:39.031
[chuckles]

11:39.115 --> 11:41.909
So, um,where do you call home?

11:41.909 --> 11:43.327
I live in California.

11:43.411 --> 11:46.038
But, uh, actually,I was born

11:46.122 --> 11:48.416
and lived here in Chicagountil I was six.

11:48.416 --> 11:51.502
- Local girl.- Yeah, I guess.

11:51.544 --> 11:53.421
- What part of the city?- North side, maybe.

11:53.546 --> 11:55.131
- Does that make sense?- Yeah.

11:55.172 --> 11:57.800
But, uh, do you knowwhat school you went to?

11:57.842 --> 11:59.760
Uh..

11:59.844 --> 12:02.138
Any other details?Streets?

12:02.179 --> 12:04.473
Uh, I'm not really sure.Details are kinda hazy.

12:04.515 --> 12:06.225
Do you remember any storesthat you went to?

12:06.308 --> 12:09.437
Sorry, I'm totally grilling you.That's, uh.. Sorry.

12:09.437 --> 12:12.356
Old reporter habits die hard.

12:12.440 --> 12:15.317
No, no, it's fine. I carry gumfor take-off and landing.

12:15.359 --> 12:17.111
- Even when I'm not flying.- Wait a minute.

12:17.153 --> 12:19.113
Um, can't your parentstell you where you lived?

12:19.155 --> 12:21.157
Uh, no. They passed.

12:21.282 --> 12:23.743
Oh, I'm sorry.

12:23.826 --> 12:27.371
That's okay. I grew up withmy grandparents in California.

12:27.413 --> 12:30.040
So, Chicago is pretty mucha blank slate.

12:30.124 --> 12:31.333
It's a great place.

12:31.459 --> 12:33.043
Yeah, I mean,I'd love to see it more.

12:33.127 --> 12:35.546
You know, if I, uh,was ever here for long enough.

12:35.629 --> 12:39.383
Actually, my parents met hereover Christmas time.

12:39.467 --> 12:42.386
- What? Really?- Yeah.

12:42.470 --> 12:43.345
Uh, how?

12:43.512 --> 12:46.015
I don't really knowthe details, actually.

12:46.140 --> 12:47.475
Not even a clue? I mean..

12:47.558 --> 12:50.978
Uh, can you..I'm just desperate for stories.

12:51.103 --> 12:52.605
[chuckles]Especially this week.

12:52.688 --> 12:55.065
But it sounds great.Did your grandparents ever..

12:55.149 --> 12:57.067
Uh, I'd love to help you.

12:57.109 --> 12:59.028
I, um,I know my grandparents said

12:59.153 --> 13:01.697
that they met hereduring college.

13:01.739 --> 13:04.325
And, um.. Oh!

13:04.450 --> 13:05.784
- Actually..- Mm-hm?

13:05.868 --> 13:09.455
Uh, this is from the Christmaswhen they met.

13:09.538 --> 13:12.333
'Uh, yeah, there's picturesof them in here from that time.'

13:12.333 --> 13:15.252
I've always been really curiousabout more of that story.

13:15.336 --> 13:16.796
- But, uh..- Yeah.

13:16.879 --> 13:18.047
I'm sorry, it's..

13:18.088 --> 13:20.174
That's probablytoo much information.

13:20.299 --> 13:21.967
No, no, no.Not enough information.

13:22.051 --> 13:25.221
Um, do you mind?Can I see the photos?

13:25.346 --> 13:27.681
Oh. Uh, no,I'll show them to you.

13:27.765 --> 13:29.975
Hey, don't break iton my account.

13:30.059 --> 13:31.852
There we go.

13:31.977 --> 13:34.188
Uh, that's mom and dad.

13:34.230 --> 13:36.065
Wow! Cool photos.

13:36.190 --> 13:38.692
[cell phone beeps]Oh, sorry.

13:38.776 --> 13:41.862
Uh, the ghostof deadlines future.

13:41.946 --> 13:44.365
I should probably grab Leahand get out of here.

13:44.490 --> 13:46.033
- Yup.- Hey, buddy, you ready?

13:46.158 --> 13:48.369
(Sydney)Hey, little one.

13:48.410 --> 13:51.247
Leah, I feel like I'm alwayssaying goodbye to you.

13:51.372 --> 13:55.209
Then, let's say it inanother language this time.

13:55.209 --> 13:56.710
That's a great idea.

13:56.794 --> 14:00.339
-Arrivederci.█- Ooh, what's that?

14:00.381 --> 14:02.508
I put in for a job postingin Rome

14:02.591 --> 14:04.552
so I've been brushing upon my Italian.

14:04.593 --> 14:07.846
- Fingers crossed.-Arrivederci,Sydney.

14:07.888 --> 14:10.057
[chuckling]Very good.

Well done.

14:11.767 --> 14:14.061
-Et Buon Natale.█- What's that?

14:14.186 --> 14:15.521
It means, "Merry Christmas."

14:15.604 --> 14:17.231
You have funwith your cousins, okay?

14:17.231 --> 14:19.233
I will. Bye, Sydney.

14:19.275 --> 14:21.735
Bye, sweet girl. And good luckwith your deadline.

14:21.819 --> 14:24.154
Thanks.Enjoy your tropical Christmas.

14:24.238 --> 14:25.781
Will do.

14:33.163 --> 14:34.248
Mm.

14:34.331 --> 14:36.208
What if I connected itthrough Oakland

14:36.292 --> 14:38.586
and then I hoppedto the Bali flight from SFO?

14:38.711 --> 14:41.255
(Anya on phone)'Sorry, Sydney, but betweenthe weather and the holidays'

14:41.338 --> 14:43.465
'right now,it's all completely full.'

14:43.591 --> 14:44.633
'Look, let me check around'

14:44.675 --> 14:46.260
'and try to worksome magic, okay?'

14:46.260 --> 14:49.263
- 'I'll call you back.'- Okay, thanks for trying, Anya.

14:49.388 --> 14:51.599

14:55.352 --> 14:57.938
[instrumental music]

15:00.608 --> 15:01.859
Oh.

15:04.403 --> 15:06.572
[cell phone keys clacking]

15:07.948 --> 15:09.283
Hey, Anya. It's Sydney again.

15:09.283 --> 15:11.452
'Can I borrow your computerskills one more time?'

15:11.577 --> 15:14.705
Now, I need to track downa passenger.

15:14.788 --> 15:16.123
It's important.

15:16.248 --> 15:19.460
[instrumental music]

15:28.385 --> 15:32.431
Wow! These peopleare not kidding around.

15:42.316 --> 15:44.401
[knocking on door]

15:44.485 --> 15:46.862
(Jonathan)Hang on a sec.There's someone at the door.

15:46.987 --> 15:48.322

I'm so sorry, I tried calling

15:52.326 --> 15:53.744
but your phone kept goingto voicemail.

15:53.786 --> 15:55.537
[whispers]Uh, yeah,my editor keeps calling.

15:55.579 --> 15:58.415
Oh, I'll be quick.I just have something of Leah's.

15:58.499 --> 16:00.751
Oh. I'll call you right back.

16:00.834 --> 16:02.461
- Sorry.- No.

16:02.503 --> 16:06.256
- Hi.- Ooh, Sydney. What's that?

16:06.340 --> 16:09.218
Something special thatI thought you might be missing.

16:09.343 --> 16:11.220
- Sydney, you found it!- Yeah.

16:11.345 --> 16:13.013
[whispering]Is that my gift for daddy?

16:13.013 --> 16:14.390
Yeah, I think somehow it got

16:14.431 --> 16:16.266
into my thingswhen your bag spilled.

16:16.350 --> 16:17.851
You wrapped it up so pretty.

16:17.851 --> 16:20.562
Actually, the conciergeat my hotel wrapped it up

16:20.688 --> 16:23.774
so pretty, because gift-wrappingis not my specialty.

16:23.857 --> 16:26.568
Oh, my gosh. Thanks for runningit all the way down here.

16:26.694 --> 16:30.447
For goodness sakes, Jonathan,invite the poor girl in.

16:30.531 --> 16:32.449
Oh, uh, right, yeah.He's totally right.

16:32.533 --> 16:34.201
You should come in.We're just trimming the tree.

16:34.243 --> 16:36.203
No, thank you so much.I have a cab waiting.

16:36.203 --> 16:38.664

16:49.258 --> 16:50.676

16:52.469 --> 16:54.221
[sighs]Why not?

16:54.304 --> 16:56.473
[chuckling]

17:02.730 --> 17:04.897
(Sydney)'Ooh. What's going on here?'

17:05.022 --> 17:08.068
Getting ready for Christmas,of course.

17:08.152 --> 17:11.029
Yeah, my family'slike a human advent calendar.

17:11.113 --> 17:13.574
We throw an event every dayleading up to Christmas.

17:13.699 --> 17:16.326
Today is tree-decorating dayat my house.

17:16.410 --> 17:17.618
Oh, gosh, look.

17:17.744 --> 17:19.454
- I don't wanna intrude.- No, no, no.

17:19.579 --> 17:21.080
You're not intruding,you're saving the day, actually.

17:21.123 --> 17:23.625
Leah's been upset ever sinceshe unpacked. Now I know why.

17:23.666 --> 17:25.377
Well, between you and me,she worked

17:25.461 --> 17:26.920
really hard on her presentfor you.

17:26.962 --> 17:29.339
Oh, we don't do Christmashalfway in this family.

17:29.423 --> 17:32.092
I noticed.

17:32.176 --> 17:34.428
Uh, so any wordon the Borneo flight?

17:34.553 --> 17:36.305
- Uh, Bali.- Bali.

17:36.430 --> 17:37.556
I'm just waitingon a jump seat.

17:39.016 --> 17:40.434
[cell phone vibrates]Oh, I gotta take this.

Actually, this is my editor.

Uh, meanwhile, Leah willgive you a tour of the house.

17:44.438 --> 17:46.565
- Hey..- Merry Christmas.

17:46.648 --> 17:48.358
- Oh!- Ho-ho-ho!

17:48.400 --> 17:50.110
Welcome.

17:50.152 --> 17:52.029
[all laugh]

17:52.070 --> 17:55.199
- That was Uncle Arthur.- Okay.

17:55.282 --> 17:57.868
And that's daddy's sister

17:57.951 --> 17:59.953
Robin over there.

18:00.037 --> 18:02.039
Great Aunt Lindawill be here soon.

18:02.122 --> 18:04.625
Oh, there are my two cousins.

18:04.750 --> 18:06.627
And here's Grandma Fiona.

18:06.627 --> 18:09.379
- And Grandpa Tom.- Oh.

18:09.421 --> 18:11.507
You must be that lovely angel

18:11.632 --> 18:13.300
that Leah'sbeen telling us about.

18:13.425 --> 18:14.676
She hasn't stopped talking

18:14.802 --> 18:18.472
about that nice flight attendantshe met on the plane.

18:18.597 --> 18:21.558
So, uh, Sydney,are you married?

18:21.642 --> 18:24.144
Of course she's not married.Do you see a ring?

18:24.269 --> 18:26.188
Not all married ladieswear rings.

18:26.313 --> 18:27.481
And how do you know that?

18:27.564 --> 18:29.316
And not all married ladiesare suspicious

18:29.441 --> 18:31.318
every time their husbandopens their mouth.

18:31.401 --> 18:33.070
My parents made a promisenever to go to bed angry

18:33.153 --> 18:36.073
so they've usually been awakefor three days straight.

18:36.156 --> 18:37.699
[Sydney laughs]

18:38.659 --> 18:40.661
- Yeah. Mm-hm.- I see.

18:40.702 --> 18:44.623
Sydney, we could use more handshere to string popcorn.

18:44.706 --> 18:47.584
This one eatsmore than he threads.

18:47.626 --> 18:49.419
Sorry, I know.My family can be a bit much.

18:49.503 --> 18:51.171
[chuckles]They're fine.

18:53.006 --> 18:56.218
Aah. Merry Christmas!

18:56.343 --> 18:58.303
Oh, I missed you all!

18:58.387 --> 19:01.348
Hey, Aunt Linda.You actually don't know her yet.

19:23.078 --> 19:25.289
Okay, get it up..

Perfect!

19:27.249 --> 19:29.001
Ta-da!

19:30.169 --> 19:32.462
Oh, except I think

19:32.504 --> 19:34.590
I strung the lightswith the plug on top.

19:34.715 --> 19:35.716
You don't happen to have

19:35.841 --> 19:39.094
an outlet in the ceiling or..

19:39.136 --> 19:42.472
- No. Don't.- I'm not very good at this.

19:42.514 --> 19:45.684
I don't really dotraditional Christmas.

19:45.726 --> 19:47.561
- No?- 'No. Not my thing.'

19:47.644 --> 19:49.563
That was kinda obvious.Um..

19:49.646 --> 19:52.399
I think we're just gonnablame it on the jetlag, uh..

19:52.524 --> 19:53.567
Yes.

19:53.567 --> 19:55.402
Oh, uh, I think that's your cab.

19:55.444 --> 19:56.778
And I'm gonna go in it

19:56.820 --> 19:59.323
before I doany more damage here.

19:59.406 --> 20:01.408
So, thank you guys so much.

20:01.450 --> 20:02.743
It was nice meeting you.

20:02.784 --> 20:03.869
[cell phone rings]

20:03.911 --> 20:06.496
Ah-ha!There's the airline calling now.

20:06.580 --> 20:09.499
Hi, Anya. What's the word?

20:09.541 --> 20:11.585
Mm-hm.

20:11.668 --> 20:13.837
Oh, okay.

20:13.921 --> 20:16.673
Yeah. Well, just let me know,um, if anything changes.

20:16.757 --> 20:19.134
- Thank you.- Uh, success?

20:19.259 --> 20:20.594
No. No luck yet.

20:20.719 --> 20:23.305
Seems that, uh,every jump seat to Bali

20:23.430 --> 20:24.598
is booked until Christmas.

20:24.598 --> 20:26.224
Jonathan, we can't have her

20:26.266 --> 20:28.227
stranded over Christmas.

20:28.268 --> 20:30.020
Oh, no, really.I'm totally fine.

20:30.062 --> 20:31.855
I have tons that I can dowhile I'm here.

20:31.939 --> 20:33.815
I've got my Italian tapes

20:33.857 --> 20:36.109
and, uh, trust me,I could use the practice.

20:36.193 --> 20:39.488
But, um, a seat will becomeavailable anytime.

20:39.529 --> 20:40.656
- Yeah?- Yes.

20:40.697 --> 20:42.115
No, really.

20:42.199 --> 20:43.742
Okay, uh..

20:43.825 --> 20:45.702
I-I think maybe we could helpeach other out.

20:45.744 --> 20:47.287
- How's that?- I need a story.

20:47.412 --> 20:48.622
And you've got a story.

20:48.705 --> 20:50.582
You know, how your parents meton Christmas.

20:50.666 --> 20:53.126
Yeah, but I mean,I barely even know that story.

20:53.168 --> 20:54.711
No, I know. That's what'sso interesting about it.

20:54.753 --> 20:56.046
And you said thatyou wanted to see more

20:56.088 --> 20:57.631
of Chicagowhen you had the time.

20:57.714 --> 20:59.299
- 'Yeah, but--'- 'Well, now you've got time.'

20:59.424 --> 21:00.634
Look, hometown girl tracks down

21:00.759 --> 21:02.469
her parents' holiday romance.

21:02.594 --> 21:04.388
That is perfectfor my Christmas column.

21:04.429 --> 21:05.931
- Are you serious?- Absolutely!

21:06.014 --> 21:08.767
Yeah. Romantic story set againstthe backdrop of Christmas.

21:08.850 --> 21:11.561
Plus, you said, you, uh,wanted a little adventure.

21:11.603 --> 21:14.064
Of course.But I mean, I wasn't..

21:14.106 --> 21:16.233
- I didn't mean like--- Okay.

21:16.316 --> 21:19.152
Full disclosure, I've alreadypitched the idea to my editor

21:19.194 --> 21:22.280
who's turned down all my otherideas, and she loves this one.

21:22.322 --> 21:24.491
- You did what?- Y-yeah.

21:24.616 --> 21:26.451
Sorry about that.But it was a..

21:26.493 --> 21:27.911
Maybe we couldhave a win-win, okay?

21:27.953 --> 21:29.538
I could help youfind your story

21:29.579 --> 21:32.541
and you could help me, uh,you know, keep my job.

21:32.666 --> 21:35.335
[both laugh]

21:35.377 --> 21:37.296
- Okay.- Perfect.

21:37.379 --> 21:38.505

We'll start tomorrow,I'll go down to the archives

21:41.550 --> 21:42.759
at the paperand see if they can find

21:42.843 --> 21:44.011
any information on your folks.

21:44.136 --> 21:46.638
We'll have to scan thosephotos in your locket

21:46.680 --> 21:47.931
'cause thoseare our first lead.

21:48.015 --> 21:49.307
- Sydney..- Oh..

21:49.391 --> 21:51.101
Don't forget these.

21:52.644 --> 21:54.271
Can't forget those.

21:54.354 --> 21:55.314
[chuckles]

21:55.397 --> 21:56.982
Adorable!

22:02.237 --> 22:03.530
(Leah)See ya!

22:03.530 --> 22:05.032
[car door closes]

22:06.533 --> 22:09.077
Oh, what did I just agree to.

22:15.208 --> 22:18.295
[instrumental music]

22:36.897 --> 22:40.901
Wow! The whole team is here,bright and early!

22:41.026 --> 22:42.944
- You still game?- Oh, yeah.

22:42.986 --> 22:44.696
I mean,it's either this or practicing

22:44.780 --> 22:46.490
my Italian with Lorenzo.

22:46.531 --> 22:47.866
Lorenzo?

22:47.908 --> 22:50.077
Oh, I downloadedan Italian tutor.

22:50.118 --> 22:53.330
And, uh, turns out, he's prettytough on conjugating verbs.

22:53.413 --> 22:55.123
Oh, I see. Um..

22:55.248 --> 22:57.667
Before we get started,Leah has something for you.

22:57.709 --> 22:59.920
Since we're gonna beyour tour guides

23:00.045 --> 23:01.797
while you're here..

23:01.922 --> 23:05.759
- "U-G."- Unaccompanied Grown-up.

23:05.884 --> 23:08.595

That's amazing!

23:10.430 --> 23:12.766
Nice work. Thank you.

23:12.808 --> 23:14.726
And I took the libertyof printing this up.

23:14.810 --> 23:16.144
So, if we can just find

23:16.186 --> 23:18.897
where in Chicagothese photos were taken

23:18.980 --> 23:21.775
I think we could probably figureout where their paths crossed.

23:21.817 --> 23:23.944
And I have a pretty good ideawhere to start.

23:24.069 --> 23:25.612
- So, we're actually doing this?- Yeah.

23:25.654 --> 23:27.948
Well, I promised my editora Christmas column

23:27.948 --> 23:29.449

23:29.449 --> 23:31.368
It's only my job on the line.

23:31.410 --> 23:33.245

23:33.328 --> 23:35.872
Okay.Oh, but first things first.

23:57.644 --> 24:00.814
We're gonna take a coupleof these fruitcakes, okay?

24:00.856 --> 24:03.150
What exactly does thishave to do with our mission?

24:03.275 --> 24:04.943
(Jonathan)'Nothing, my, uh'

24:04.985 --> 24:06.069

24:11.658 --> 24:14.286
Look, daddy, cuckoo clocks.

24:15.912 --> 24:18.498
Leah seems to know her wayaround here pretty well.

24:18.582 --> 24:21.293

24:21.334 --> 24:24.004

- Christmas tradition.- Ooh.

24:33.263 --> 24:35.182

24:35.307 --> 24:37.309
You ever feel likeyou're missin' out

24:37.350 --> 24:39.019

24:39.102 --> 24:41.021
Oh, my gosh.Are you kidding me?

24:41.062 --> 24:43.815
I've been to Christmas massin Salzburg Cathedral

24:43.857 --> 24:45.859
and I've seen real reindeerin Russia.

24:45.942 --> 24:47.819
I mean, why would you ever wannastay in one place

24:47.861 --> 24:49.029
when you can travel the globe?

24:49.029 --> 24:50.280
To celebrate Christmas.

24:50.363 --> 24:51.198
But I do celebrate.

24:51.364 --> 24:53.950
I just celebrateall over the world.

24:54.034 --> 24:56.536
I mean, at the end of the dayon the slopes, I come home

24:56.661 --> 24:58.330
I've perfectedthe hotel room Christmas.

24:58.413 --> 24:59.915
You can make a Christmas treeout of hangers.

24:59.956 --> 25:01.541
You put the little tinypillow mints underneath.

25:01.583 --> 25:03.919
And then, you hang a big old"Do Not Disturb" sign on top.

25:03.960 --> 25:06.046
- It's great.- Why am I not surprised?

25:06.046 --> 25:07.547
So, no hanging stockings?

25:07.672 --> 25:09.216
Out to dryon a balcony in Venice.

25:09.299 --> 25:11.676
Or feeding reindeerat a local Santa's village?

25:11.760 --> 25:12.886
That I've never done.

25:12.969 --> 25:14.679
But I've run with the bullsin Spain.

25:14.721 --> 25:16.890
Okay, message received.

25:23.855 --> 25:25.148
You're an arborist, right?

25:25.232 --> 25:27.317
Can you tell mewhat kind of trees those are

25:27.400 --> 25:28.944
in the background?

25:30.487 --> 25:33.031
I'd say those curved branchesare Fraser firs.

25:33.114 --> 25:35.242
Do you know anywhere around herethat I could get those?

25:35.367 --> 25:38.036
Christmas tree, lots,but these are rare.

25:38.119 --> 25:40.914
I remember one placethat sold them.

25:42.040 --> 25:43.708
Sorry, it's been years.

25:43.792 --> 25:45.335
No problem. Thanks.

25:45.418 --> 25:48.505
Okay, not a slam dunk,but we have our first lead.

25:48.588 --> 25:49.923
- Fraser firs.- Right.

25:50.006 --> 25:52.968
That narrows it downto a larger part of the world.

25:53.093 --> 25:55.178
Are you sure that you'rean investigative reporter?

25:55.220 --> 25:57.430
Oh, so I'm a little rusty. What?

25:57.514 --> 26:00.934
[cell phone beeps]Oh, being side-tracked here.

26:00.976 --> 26:03.436
Okay, what's your favoriteChristmas dessert?

26:03.520 --> 26:04.854

26:06.481 --> 26:08.942
So, you don't have dinner plansfor tonight.

26:08.942 --> 26:11.111

26:11.152 --> 26:14.781
No. But I'm not gonna intrudeon your family again.

26:14.864 --> 26:16.741
I don't wanna go afoulof Aunt Linda.

26:16.825 --> 26:18.785
But if you do,that's-that's on you.

26:18.827 --> 26:22.789
Oh, well, then we shouldlet the sleepy reindeer lie.

26:22.914 --> 26:23.873
That's a smart choice.

26:23.957 --> 26:24.916
Besides, my family really likes

26:24.958 --> 26:25.959
a good Christmas mystery.

26:25.959 --> 26:27.419
They can probably help us out.

26:35.343 --> 26:36.886

30:22.028 --> 30:23.196
ever ask how we first met.

30:23.279 --> 30:24.656
- 'Oh, really?'- Because we know.

40:28.175 --> 40:31.929
I'm hosting, uh, cookiedecorating at my house tonight.

40:31.971 --> 40:33.556
That can be your dessert.

40:34.723 --> 40:36.475
Our? Oh, no, no, no.

40:36.600 --> 40:39.186
There is no way I am crashingmore of your Christmas plans.

40:39.228 --> 40:41.147
You can just drop me offat the hotel, seriously.

40:41.230 --> 40:43.107
I'm not gonna eatthose cookies by myself.

40:44.567 --> 40:48.737
- Really? Are you sure?- He's sure, and I'm sure.

40:48.821 --> 40:50.322
Let's go.

40:51.073 --> 40:54.326
[instrumental music]

40:55.369 --> 40:57.371
[fire crackling]

40:58.831 --> 41:00.833
The place looks fantastic,Jonathan.

41:00.916 --> 41:02.376
Ah, thank you.

41:03.335 --> 41:05.546
Ooh. Thanks, mom.

41:10.092 --> 41:13.888
(Sydney)Ooh, nice. Delicious.

41:13.929 --> 41:15.472
Looking good.

41:17.433 --> 41:19.643
(Robin)'Okay, kids,whoever wants to lick the bowls

41:19.685 --> 41:21.312
get in the kitchen,pronto.

41:21.395 --> 41:24.857
Whoa! Leah, is there a cookieunderneath all those sprinkles?

41:24.940 --> 41:26.984
Only way to know is to try it.

41:27.067 --> 41:30.029
(Sydney)Leah, you arethe Frida Kahlo of frosting

41:30.029 --> 41:31.864
and the Van Gogh of vanilla.

41:31.864 --> 41:33.324
What does that mean?

41:33.365 --> 41:36.952
It means that your cookies are,without question, the very best.

41:37.036 --> 41:40.206
(Jonathan)You look likeyou're enjoying yourself.

41:40.331 --> 41:42.041
By the way,I left word at the newspaper

41:42.166 --> 41:44.001
in case there's any new infoon the ballet.

41:44.084 --> 41:46.670
I thought you said you don'tdo a traditional Christmas.

41:46.712 --> 41:49.965
- Oh, who knew?- Oh.

41:50.007 --> 41:52.593
I guess, if you can't beat 'em,join 'em.

41:52.718 --> 41:54.011
- Right?- Indeed.

41:54.094 --> 41:55.721
Why don't you dosome decorating yourself?

41:55.846 --> 41:57.514
- What is that, a challenge?- Yes, it is.

41:57.556 --> 41:59.058
- Alright.- Have a seat.

41:59.141 --> 42:00.768
- Okay.- You a reindeer guy?

42:00.809 --> 42:01.894
Or a boot?You're gonna go with the boot?

42:01.894 --> 42:03.103
You're trying to copy me?

42:03.145 --> 42:05.898
Yeah, well, I figuredit's a direct comparison.

42:05.940 --> 42:09.818
[laughing]Oh, no. I have a badfeeling about this.

42:09.860 --> 42:12.488
- Me too.- Is your dad good at this?

42:12.571 --> 42:14.240
Oh, oh.

42:14.365 --> 42:16.075
Yeah, I could useall the help I can get.

42:16.158 --> 42:20.746
- 'Can I borrow some red icing?'- Yes, you may. Right.

42:20.746 --> 42:21.956
Here he goes.

42:22.081 --> 42:23.499
- Got it goin' on.- Alright.

42:23.582 --> 42:27.586
- Oh, what do you think?- I think it looks yummy.

42:27.628 --> 42:30.881
- But I need to know for sure.- Who's my judge?

42:30.965 --> 42:32.716
You have a sweet girl,that's what you have.

42:32.800 --> 42:34.426
(Jonathan)'Take it easy,we have to save some of those'

42:34.468 --> 42:36.428
for Christmas morning.

42:36.428 --> 42:37.638
- Daddy?- Yeah?

42:37.763 --> 42:41.016
Sydney isn't going to be hereon Christmas morning.

42:41.100 --> 42:44.270
And then, what if someonehas a gift for her?

42:45.729 --> 42:49.275
You are so sweet and not justbecause you're covered in icing.

42:49.316 --> 42:51.443
'But you don't haveto worry about me, okay?'

42:51.485 --> 42:53.737
What do you say we give somepresents out tomorrow night?

42:53.821 --> 42:56.991
Christmas Eve Eve, right?Start a new tradition.

42:57.032 --> 42:58.367
Sounds great.

42:58.409 --> 43:00.536
Jonathan, can you help mewith the dishes?

43:00.619 --> 43:01.745
Yeah, I got this.

43:02.955 --> 43:06.667
Sydney, want to makea snowman outside?

43:06.792 --> 43:09.795
I might be a little rusty..

43:09.837 --> 43:14.800
...but, um, it's Christmas time,so, what do you say?

43:14.883 --> 43:16.176
Let's go.

43:17.303 --> 43:20.389
Let's make a snowmanten-feet tall.

43:20.431 --> 43:23.976
Oh, or we could makea snow-kid

43:24.059 --> 43:25.144
that's like,about your height.

43:25.227 --> 43:26.895
What do you thinkabout that?

43:26.979 --> 43:30.232
- Let's go.- Okay.

43:31.984 --> 43:34.236
[instrumental music]

43:36.071 --> 43:39.325
[indistinct chatter]

43:46.874 --> 43:48.292
[laughing]

43:48.375 --> 43:49.376
Oh, no!

43:51.003 --> 43:52.588
Kids are readyfor Christmas film fest.

43:52.671 --> 43:55.007
Okay. I just wanna give hera couple more minutes.

43:55.132 --> 43:57.343
Peace! Peace! Truce! Truce!

43:57.468 --> 44:00.346
I haven't seen Leahthis happy in a while.

44:00.429 --> 44:03.724
Yeah. She and Sydneyare having a lot of fun.

44:03.849 --> 44:05.267
I think you have, too.

44:05.309 --> 44:06.852
It's the first Christmasin a while

44:06.977 --> 44:08.520
I've seen you this happy.

44:08.562 --> 44:11.273
Yeah, I've been havinga pretty great week.

44:11.315 --> 44:14.610
Look, you're doingan amazing job with Leah.

44:14.693 --> 44:16.445
You always put her first.

44:16.528 --> 44:19.740
But maybe, it's time you thoughtabout yourself again, too.

44:19.865 --> 44:21.533
Seize the day.

44:21.617 --> 44:23.285
My day is seized

44:23.369 --> 44:26.955
in-between the...bake salesand the brownies

44:27.039 --> 44:28.707
and the birthday parties.

44:28.791 --> 44:30.334
I don't have roomfor more.

44:30.417 --> 44:34.213
When was the last time you wenton a date, last Christmas?

44:34.254 --> 44:37.049
Look, I appreciatethe sisterly advice, but..

44:37.091 --> 44:39.134
But you don't want it.

44:39.968 --> 44:41.512
Exactly.

44:43.806 --> 44:46.475
No, don't throw.Stop it.

44:48.227 --> 44:51.230
I haven't done this since..

44:51.355 --> 44:54.233
Wow! Since I wasprobably about your age.

44:54.233 --> 44:56.568
Like, ten years ago.

44:56.693 --> 44:59.446
Yes!Exactly that.

44:59.488 --> 45:01.907
No, I think it wasa little longer than that.

45:02.032 --> 45:05.035
- Sydney?- 'Yeah?'

45:05.077 --> 45:09.331
Are sky angelslike snow angels?

45:09.373 --> 45:11.041
Hm..

45:11.083 --> 45:13.252
That's a reallygood question.

45:13.293 --> 45:16.755
All I know is that they'reboth really beautiful

45:16.797 --> 45:20.968
whether they're in the snowor up in the clouds.

45:21.093 --> 45:22.761
And I'm an expertin the clouds

45:22.845 --> 45:26.432
because I've spent almosthalf my life up there.

45:26.432 --> 45:29.601
(Jonathan)The cousins are startingthe Christmas movies, honey.

45:29.643 --> 45:33.564
Ooh, I hope they rememberedcaramel popcorn.

45:34.481 --> 45:35.482
Aw..

45:35.524 --> 45:36.525
Thank you.

45:36.567 --> 45:40.154
Oh! Wait!What are you doing to my angels?

45:42.156 --> 45:44.366
Looks like you guysare having some fun.

45:44.408 --> 45:46.618
Yes, I, uh,couldn't have asked

45:46.702 --> 45:49.955
for better Christmas chaperonesfor this week.

45:49.955 --> 45:51.123
Hey, I heard from my editor.

45:51.123 --> 45:52.499
Um, your folks didn't show up

45:52.624 --> 45:53.959
in any ofthe "Nutcracker" programs.

45:54.084 --> 45:55.294
That was a long shot.

45:55.419 --> 45:56.795
And they're notin the archives either.

45:56.837 --> 45:58.922
So, back to square one.

45:59.006 --> 46:00.466
That's okay.

46:01.091 --> 46:02.801
I just made a snow angel

46:02.926 --> 46:04.511
so that is giving mea pretty big

46:04.553 --> 46:06.638
sense of accomplishmentright now.

46:07.848 --> 46:10.058
Johnny, the kids want meto watch movies with them.

46:10.142 --> 46:12.811
Uh, you two mind finishing upthe dishes?

46:13.896 --> 46:16.482
Sure, yeah. We're on it.

46:16.523 --> 46:17.608
[chuckling]

46:18.317 --> 46:20.235
(Jonathan)Nice work today.

46:20.319 --> 46:23.155
You're getting into thatholiday spirit, I see.

46:23.197 --> 46:26.408
[chuckles]I am, I'm..

46:26.450 --> 46:28.243
...actually havinga great time.

46:28.327 --> 46:30.370
Yeah, those snow angelslooked sharp. You know--

46:30.496 --> 46:31.997
I was impressed,I was impressed.

46:32.080 --> 46:33.332
I was..We were all impressed.

46:33.373 --> 46:36.418
It's funny, you know like,Christmases bring back

46:36.502 --> 46:38.337
so many happymemories for me.

46:38.337 --> 46:40.047
Some bittersweet, as well.

46:40.172 --> 46:41.965
- I know what you mean.- Yeah.

46:42.007 --> 46:43.217
Well, I gotta say,this past week

46:43.342 --> 46:45.135
Leah's been so happy,you know?

46:45.219 --> 46:46.512
And I don't think thatthe caroling and the cookies

46:46.595 --> 46:48.305
are just fun, I thinkthat they're also giving her

46:48.388 --> 46:50.224
this sense of stabilityand normalcy

46:50.265 --> 46:52.351
that she reallyhas been needing.

46:52.392 --> 46:53.936
- I understand.- And if I'm being honest, I..

46:54.019 --> 46:56.230
I don't think I'm beingsuch a great dad all the time.

46:56.355 --> 46:57.815
I'm always on a callor a deadline

46:57.898 --> 47:01.193
and trying to be this acecolumnist and this perfect dad

47:01.235 --> 47:03.487
and I'm probablyjust floundering at both.

47:03.570 --> 47:06.365
That is so not true.Are you kidding?

47:06.448 --> 47:09.701
- Just look at the evidence.- The evidence?

47:09.827 --> 47:12.412
What a great kid you have.

47:14.790 --> 47:16.250
You know what?

47:16.291 --> 47:18.377
- I have to thank you.- For what?

47:18.502 --> 47:22.214
For inviting meto be a part of all this.

47:22.297 --> 47:25.759
And, I have a confessionto make.

47:25.884 --> 47:28.053
But dinner around a table

47:28.136 --> 47:30.347
definitely beats room service.

47:31.598 --> 47:36.562
I guess I just forgot, like,how much fun Christmas can be.

47:41.692 --> 47:43.485
- Careful. Sorry.- I'm sorry.

47:43.569 --> 47:45.070
- I'm just gonna--- 'Oh.'

47:45.153 --> 47:47.531
- Oh. Okay.- Actually..

47:47.614 --> 47:49.867
- 'Whoops.'- Oh. Here, did you..

47:49.908 --> 47:53.036
Here, I'll wash.You dry.

47:53.078 --> 47:55.289
- Okay.- 'Sure.'

47:59.585 --> 48:03.130
(Arthur)'Jonathan, Sydney,come here, we've got something.'

48:03.171 --> 48:05.048
- Oh.- Okay.

48:05.090 --> 48:07.676
- Let's go check. Give me that.- No.

48:07.759 --> 48:09.928
No? Come on. Hey!

48:13.140 --> 48:16.518
Okay, so, tech wizard that I am,I managed to scan in

48:16.560 --> 48:18.437
the photosat a higher resolution.

48:18.562 --> 48:22.024
Now, take a look, that's nota ballet outfit she's wearing.

48:22.065 --> 48:23.483
'It's an ice-skating outfit.'

48:23.609 --> 48:25.319
(Sydney)'Wait, ata "Nutcracker" performance?'

48:25.444 --> 48:27.613
Oh, no, no, no. Take a lookat the background here.

48:27.654 --> 48:30.032
You see that "Nutcracker" figureis the same one

48:30.073 --> 48:31.366
'they haveat the Christmas display'

48:31.450 --> 48:32.701
'every year at City Park.'

48:32.743 --> 48:34.244
(Robin)'I know exactly where that is.'

48:34.328 --> 48:35.704
- 'It's just by the ice rink.'- Mm-hm.

48:35.746 --> 48:37.414
- 'Yeah.'- Well, of course.

48:37.456 --> 48:38.916
I mean,it makes really good sense.

48:38.999 --> 48:42.544
- She loved skating.- We're getting warmer here.

48:42.628 --> 48:45.464
Thank you. We're gonna gocheck it out tomorrow, right?

48:45.547 --> 48:47.549
- 'Thanks. Yeah, definitely.'- 'Okay.'

48:47.633 --> 48:49.801
(Leah)I'm gonna head backto the hotel for now.

48:49.843 --> 48:50.886
'But, thank you, Leah.'

48:50.969 --> 48:52.971
I had so much fun playingwith you today.

48:53.096 --> 48:54.931
Thank you so much,sweet girl.

48:55.015 --> 48:56.683
I hope you don't mind

48:56.725 --> 49:00.520
but I've been prayingfor bad weather.

49:00.562 --> 49:01.313
Why?

49:01.438 --> 49:04.566
To keep you here longer,of course.

49:04.650 --> 49:07.152
Come here, you.Thank you.

49:07.277 --> 49:08.654
I'm gonna see you tomorrowthough, okay?

49:08.779 --> 49:10.197
- You walk me out?- Yeah.

49:10.322 --> 49:11.657
Okay. Come on.

49:11.782 --> 49:14.076
- Good work, sweetheart.- Thanks.

49:18.330 --> 49:19.414
(Lorenzo on speaker)'Lesson 10.'

49:19.498 --> 49:21.416
[speaking in foreign language]

49:21.500 --> 49:23.627
[cell phone ringing]Mm.

49:25.504 --> 49:29.007
Kerry, hi.Where are you?

49:29.132 --> 49:30.300
Tulsa. Just landed.

49:30.384 --> 49:31.885
But the better question is,where are you?

49:31.927 --> 49:34.179
- Still in Chicago?- Merrily marooned.

49:34.179 --> 49:37.182
(Kerry)'So, are you stillflying out on Christmas day?'

49:37.182 --> 49:39.017
As far I know..

49:39.017 --> 49:42.479
...three more days to feaston Christmas cookies.

49:42.562 --> 49:45.023
Unless, of course,my flights get cancelled.

49:45.148 --> 49:46.525
So, how are things going?

49:46.566 --> 49:50.362
I'm having a surprisingly goodtime being stranded in Chicago.

49:50.487 --> 49:52.698
Doing what, exactly?

49:52.698 --> 49:55.534
(Sydney)Well, today..

49:55.534 --> 49:57.786
...we made Christmas cookies.

49:57.869 --> 50:01.540
- And I made a snow angel.- You made a snow angel?

50:01.581 --> 50:03.834
You should try it sometime.It's actually quite fun.

50:03.917 --> 50:06.128
Just tell me this,in this little

50:06.211 --> 50:07.838
Chicago Christmas scenario

50:07.921 --> 50:11.508
is there a guyinvolved, perhaps?

50:12.551 --> 50:14.720
(Sydney)No, there is not.

50:14.845 --> 50:17.264
I mean, there's a guy,but it's not like that.

50:17.389 --> 50:18.640
His name is Jonathan.

50:18.724 --> 50:20.559
Mostly, I've just beenhanging out with his family

50:20.642 --> 50:22.060
for, like, the last three days.

50:22.144 --> 50:23.228
Aah! I knew it!

50:23.311 --> 50:24.896
You're, you're fallingfor him, too.

50:24.938 --> 50:27.232
- I can hear it in your voice.- No, I am not.

50:27.315 --> 50:28.442
I'm not falling for anybody.

50:28.567 --> 50:29.901
I'm not even looking to fall

50:29.943 --> 50:31.319
and neither is he.

50:31.403 --> 50:32.696
How's the weather in Tulsa?

50:32.738 --> 50:35.282
Apparently, not as warmas in Chicago.

50:35.323 --> 50:37.075
'Listen, I am,I'm gonna be landing'

50:37.159 --> 50:38.410
in O'Hare late tomorrow night.

50:38.535 --> 50:39.995
On my way home for Christmas,do you wanna

50:40.078 --> 50:41.455
maybe grab a Christmas mocha?

50:41.580 --> 50:44.583
- Yeah, that sounds perfect.- Okay, I'll give you a shout.

50:44.708 --> 50:47.711
- Okay.Ciao, ciao.█- Bye.

50:50.881 --> 50:52.048
Mm.

50:53.258 --> 50:54.259
Green one.

50:54.301 --> 50:56.720
[instrumental music]

50:56.803 --> 51:01.725
Our next stopon our Christmas quest..

51:02.601 --> 51:05.437
...is a Christmas tree farm..

51:08.940 --> 51:14.196
...where, along the pines,we discovered..

51:17.157 --> 51:19.242
Got you covered, dad.

51:26.374 --> 51:29.878
...another breadcrumbin our search.

51:35.967 --> 51:39.096
Wow, look at this.Your family comes through again.

51:39.179 --> 51:40.597
There's our Nutcrackers.

51:40.680 --> 51:42.516
- 'There's our ice rink.'- 'Yeah.'

51:42.641 --> 51:46.645
So, whoever took my mom'sphotograph must've been standing

51:46.645 --> 51:48.522
up on that gazebo, right?

51:48.647 --> 51:51.108
We don't know the whole story,but I'm pretty sure your mom

51:51.191 --> 51:52.275
'skated on that rink.'

51:52.359 --> 51:53.819
I guess, skatingran in the family

51:53.819 --> 51:57.322
'cause my grandma always made metake skating lessons growing up.

51:57.447 --> 52:00.867
They sure look likethey're having fun.

52:00.909 --> 52:02.077
Oh, do they?

52:02.119 --> 52:04.663
I mean, we are hereat an ice rink, right?

52:04.704 --> 52:08.750
It would be a shame for usnot to give it a try.

52:08.792 --> 52:11.253
Oh, I don't thinkthat's a good idea.

52:11.336 --> 52:12.879
Come on, daddy.

52:13.004 --> 52:16.216
What's the matter, you afraidof a little Christmas adventure?

52:16.341 --> 52:19.010
Well, I don't think "Afraid"is a strong enough word.

52:19.094 --> 52:21.179
[whispers]I think we should do it. Yeah?

52:21.263 --> 52:24.015
(Sydney)Let's go. You're in.

52:24.141 --> 52:25.767
Come on!

52:28.270 --> 52:30.772
[Leah yelling]

52:33.108 --> 52:34.401
- Come on!- Wow.

52:34.442 --> 52:36.152
What are you,a professional skater?

52:36.236 --> 52:37.362
It's coming back to me.

52:37.487 --> 52:39.155
- 'Slowly?'- Yeah! Yeah!

52:39.239 --> 52:42.325
Literally, literally skatingcircles around me.

52:42.367 --> 52:43.577
(Sydney)'Not really.'

52:43.618 --> 52:45.704
Look at you, monkey,you're doing great.

52:45.745 --> 52:49.708
Aunty Robin thinks I mighteven be ready for hockey soon.

52:49.708 --> 52:52.419
Oh, thanks a lot, Aunty Robin.

52:52.460 --> 52:54.212
Looks like skatingruns in your family.

52:54.254 --> 52:56.715
Well, you know, one of my veryfirst memories was my mom

52:56.840 --> 52:58.049
taking me to the ice rink.

52:58.133 --> 53:00.302
She'd put me in betweenher legs and spin me around.

53:00.343 --> 53:02.220
You know, we always usedto have so much fun.

53:02.220 --> 53:04.055
Ah, that's great material.

53:04.139 --> 53:06.641
I'd take notes,but I'm afraid I'd face plant.

53:06.725 --> 53:09.603
- Can we take a selfie?- Yeah, you wanna take a selfie?

53:09.728 --> 53:11.229
Just be careful of the otherskaters. Come over here.

53:11.229 --> 53:12.981
Assuming I can stop.

53:13.857 --> 53:16.276
Here, careful,careful, careful.

53:16.401 --> 53:18.320
Are you ready?

53:18.361 --> 53:19.863
- Here we go.- I was stomping.

53:20.697 --> 53:22.407
- Got it.- Yeah!

53:22.532 --> 53:25.702
- Good job, dad.- Good job, dad.

53:30.457 --> 53:32.292
Oh, now you're rubbin' it in.

53:32.334 --> 53:34.169
[chuckling]

53:35.503 --> 53:37.714
Aww. You know what?

53:37.756 --> 53:39.174
The sun's about to set.

53:39.257 --> 53:40.217
You wanna go up and check out

53:40.258 --> 53:41.468
the view from the gazebo?

53:41.509 --> 53:45.180
Oh, get out of these skates?Yes, please.

53:55.315 --> 53:56.900
(Sydney)Hm.

53:58.860 --> 54:00.612
Wow.

54:00.737 --> 54:01.905
Yeah, look at that.

54:01.988 --> 54:03.823
The view is just likefrom the photograph.

54:03.949 --> 54:05.283
(Jonathan)'Yeah.'

54:05.325 --> 54:07.160
(Sydney)'Do you think my dadcould've been'

54:07.285 --> 54:08.203
the one to stand here

54:08.286 --> 54:10.455
and take that photo of my mom?

54:10.497 --> 54:14.167
From this angle, well,I think you might be right.

54:15.710 --> 54:18.964
[instrumental music]

54:21.549 --> 54:23.176
Daddy, listen.

54:23.969 --> 54:27.722
- Dance?- My pleasure.

54:31.476 --> 54:34.771
[instrumental music]

54:37.148 --> 54:39.401
[humming]

54:41.152 --> 54:43.488
(Jonathan)'Mm. Nice.'

54:43.571 --> 54:46.616
Okay, Sydney.Now your turn.

54:46.700 --> 54:51.037
- Aww. I'm good, sweetie.- Dance, you guys!

54:52.706 --> 54:54.082
Hey, monkey.

54:54.165 --> 54:55.834
[laughing]

54:57.002 --> 54:59.838
[clearing throat]Alright.

55:01.381 --> 55:04.467
[music continues]

55:10.390 --> 55:12.225
[chuckling]

55:21.026 --> 55:23.570
Ha-hah.She's having fun.

55:23.695 --> 55:24.946
You know, it's funny.

55:25.030 --> 55:28.700
These past several dayshave sort of felt like..

55:28.825 --> 55:30.535
...finding an unopenedChristmas present

55:30.577 --> 55:33.830
in the closet and gettingto take a peek inside.

55:35.373 --> 55:39.544
When other kids at schoolwould talk about their parents..

55:39.586 --> 55:42.130
...it would always make mewonder about my own.

55:43.131 --> 55:45.383
I mean, even thoughmy grandparents would

55:45.508 --> 55:48.178
would talk aboutmy folks all the time..

55:48.261 --> 55:50.221
...I guess..

55:50.263 --> 55:54.100
...I always felt sort of likea puzzle with a missing piece.

55:54.142 --> 55:57.729
Well, I wish myreporting skills were better.

55:57.771 --> 56:00.190
We haven't figured outhow they actually met yet.

56:00.273 --> 56:02.692
No.

56:02.776 --> 56:06.529
Even if we only know a partof their Christmas story

56:06.613 --> 56:08.281
I feel like there'sa silver lining.

56:08.406 --> 56:09.532
What do you mean?

56:09.616 --> 56:13.369
I only have a coupleof photographs of my parents

56:13.453 --> 56:16.873
and my memories, but I neverimagined that I would be able

56:16.915 --> 56:20.085
to actually standin their footsteps

56:20.210 --> 56:24.172
and feel so close to themat Christmas.

56:24.214 --> 56:28.218
- And do you?- Yeah. I do.

56:29.302 --> 56:33.014
And all while having a blastat the same time.

56:33.098 --> 56:34.933
'Chicago puts on quite a show.'

56:35.058 --> 56:37.602
Whoa, you should seethis town at New Year's.

56:37.644 --> 56:38.770
- Yeah?- Yeah.

56:38.895 --> 56:40.230
Well, stranger thingshave happened.

56:40.313 --> 56:44.400
I never even expectedto be here for this long.

56:47.112 --> 56:49.531
It's interesting to thinkabout how many happy memories

56:49.572 --> 56:52.075
this gazebohas probably seen.

56:55.954 --> 56:58.331
You never know whena new one might happen.

57:00.792 --> 57:02.001
Yeah.

57:03.169 --> 57:05.130
Oh!

57:05.171 --> 57:07.465
It wasn't quite the memoryI was thinking of.

57:07.590 --> 57:09.384
[laughing]Me either.

57:09.467 --> 57:11.553
Ah! Oh! It's on!

57:11.636 --> 57:13.179
Snowball fight!

57:14.139 --> 57:16.224
(Sydney)Leah! Let's flank your dad.

57:16.307 --> 57:19.811
I don't know what that means,but let's do it!

57:19.936 --> 57:21.813
It means that you get himfrom your side

57:21.813 --> 57:23.440
and I'll get him from mine.

57:23.523 --> 57:25.483
Oh, I'm so scared.

57:26.484 --> 57:29.195
Here I come!Here I come.

57:30.989 --> 57:33.199
[screaming]

[instrumental music]

58:00.351 --> 58:01.519
Hi, how are you?

58:01.603 --> 58:03.563
Can I get one coffee please?

58:05.023 --> 58:07.525
Thank you so much.Keep the change.

58:13.448 --> 58:16.492
Hello, sir. You look like youcould use a little warming up.

58:16.576 --> 58:19.787
Oh, thank you, ma'am.This'll sure hit the spot.

58:19.871 --> 58:21.706
You certainly havethe Christmas spirit.

58:21.748 --> 58:23.124
Yes, I do.

58:23.708 --> 58:27.003
[instrumental music]

58:34.552 --> 58:36.179
[doorbell jingles]

58:43.061 --> 58:46.397
Hi, may I help you?

58:46.481 --> 58:47.565
Hi. Yes, um..

58:47.732 --> 58:51.736
There's a little guardian angelnecklace in the window..

58:51.861 --> 58:54.197
That's our display, but..

58:54.239 --> 58:57.534
...I have one right here.

58:57.575 --> 58:59.786
Aah. Yeah, it's perfect.

58:59.827 --> 59:01.746
I know someone who wouldlove that for Christmas.

59:01.829 --> 59:04.332
And I have a nice boxthat'll go in.

59:04.374 --> 59:05.333
Great.

59:05.375 --> 59:09.295
And, uh,I just need one other gift.

59:09.337 --> 59:10.922
You lookingfor anything special?

59:10.964 --> 59:14.342
I'm not really great atpicking out Christmas presents.

59:14.384 --> 59:15.677
[laughs]

59:15.718 --> 59:18.513
Uh, well, over here,we have a lovely, uh

59:18.596 --> 59:19.764
vintage mahogany washboard.

59:19.764 --> 59:21.057
'It's very popular.'

59:21.099 --> 59:22.809
Yeah, I'm no Mrs. Claus

59:22.850 --> 59:25.937
but I'm pretty sureit's not his style.

59:26.062 --> 59:27.939
You know what I mean?

59:27.939 --> 59:31.067
Oh, I like the typewriters,though, those are nice.

59:31.150 --> 59:34.153
I don't know. Maybe that'll justremind him too much of work.

59:34.195 --> 59:36.906
How about I let you, uh,browse around on your own?

59:36.948 --> 59:39.492
Some people justshop better solo.

59:39.534 --> 59:41.077
Okay, thank you.

59:42.537 --> 59:44.163
Hmm.

59:55.967 --> 59:58.177
[music box chiming]

01:00:15.403 --> 01:00:20.325
Sydney, look at my pineconeSanta I made. He's perfect.

01:00:20.408 --> 01:00:23.494
Yeah, they did turn outpretty well, didn't they?

01:00:23.578 --> 01:00:25.955
Here's another oneready for the tree.

01:00:25.997 --> 01:00:27.749
So glad you remembered.

01:00:27.832 --> 01:00:30.543
I know, I guess it's sort oflike riding a bike

01:00:30.668 --> 01:00:32.128
or playing the piano, huh?

01:00:32.211 --> 01:00:34.297
Though, I did refreshmy memory by watching

01:00:34.339 --> 01:00:36.883
a couple of onlinecraft videos.

01:00:36.924 --> 01:00:39.761
- They look great.- 'Yeah, they do.'

01:00:39.802 --> 01:00:42.305
Next step,perching them on the tree.

01:00:42.347 --> 01:00:46.309
Shall we? Come on.Great.

01:00:48.853 --> 01:00:50.480
- Thank you.- Right there.

01:00:50.563 --> 01:00:53.566
[music box playing]

01:00:55.443 --> 01:00:58.196
- What do you think?- Perfect.

01:00:58.279 --> 01:01:02.200
Daddy, come seethe ornaments we made.

01:01:02.241 --> 01:01:04.535
The ornaments are a hit.

01:01:04.619 --> 01:01:05.703
Seems so.

01:01:05.828 --> 01:01:07.413
Which makes me think, um..

01:01:07.455 --> 01:01:09.165
...could you help me outwith something?

01:01:09.207 --> 01:01:12.210
- Sure.- R-r-right this way.

01:01:14.545 --> 01:01:17.215
(Sydney)Wow. Yours looks so pretty.

01:01:17.256 --> 01:01:19.384
Why when I wrap giftsdoes it always look like

01:01:19.467 --> 01:01:21.511
they fell out of the backof a car?

01:01:21.594 --> 01:01:22.762
Yeah.

01:01:22.804 --> 01:01:24.013
Oh, no!

01:01:24.055 --> 01:01:25.390
You're, like, "I agree."

01:01:25.431 --> 01:01:26.516
[laughing]

01:01:26.557 --> 01:01:28.101
- That's okay. It's okay.- No..

01:01:28.142 --> 01:01:29.769
Well, you know,wrapping, like, anything

01:01:29.894 --> 01:01:31.104
just is an acquired skill.

01:01:31.229 --> 01:01:32.271
- Yes.- Yes.

01:01:32.397 --> 01:01:34.190
Um, okay.Here's something you can do.

01:01:34.232 --> 01:01:35.233
Uh, why don't youput your finger

01:01:35.358 --> 01:01:36.609
right thereso I can make a bow?

01:01:36.734 --> 01:01:38.444
Sure. That I can do.

01:01:38.486 --> 01:01:40.071
[laughing]

01:01:41.030 --> 01:01:43.366
So, you travel a lotfor work, huh?

01:01:43.449 --> 01:01:44.242
Yeah, I do.

01:01:44.409 --> 01:01:46.035
Mm, life's an adventure though,right?

01:01:46.119 --> 01:01:49.539
Hm. Yeah. Well,adventure comes in many forms.

01:01:49.622 --> 01:01:53.501
Like you said,"Life's an adventure."

01:01:53.584 --> 01:01:57.213
Hey, Sydney.Can I borrow you for a sec?

01:01:59.924 --> 01:02:01.426
Oh, sure. Sure, go.

01:02:01.551 --> 01:02:02.760
- Thank you.- You poor thing.

01:02:02.802 --> 01:02:04.554
[laughing]

01:02:04.595 --> 01:02:05.847
It's an acquired skill.

01:02:05.888 --> 01:02:08.307
(Sydney)'We'll keep workin' on it.'

01:02:09.267 --> 01:02:11.269
[music box playing]

01:02:11.352 --> 01:02:13.312
(Jonathan)There's too many great choices.

01:02:13.354 --> 01:02:15.606
I can only pick three photosfor my column.

01:02:15.648 --> 01:02:19.861
Wow, I guess that's gonna bebetween you and your editor.

01:02:19.944 --> 01:02:21.946
How's the word count going?

01:02:21.988 --> 01:02:25.032
Well, somehow,my writer's block melted away.

01:02:25.074 --> 01:02:26.826
Just gotta figure outhow this ends.

01:02:26.951 --> 01:02:28.244
And when is itgonna be published?

01:02:28.327 --> 01:02:30.037
Well, if my editor signs off,tomorrow night

01:02:30.121 --> 01:02:32.081
Christmas Eve.

01:02:32.165 --> 01:02:33.666
Wow.

01:02:33.791 --> 01:02:35.918
Is there anywhere in the worldthat you haven't been?

01:02:35.960 --> 01:02:38.755
[chuckles]Of course, plenty of places.

01:02:38.838 --> 01:02:40.590
I do like to takea couple of shots

01:02:40.673 --> 01:02:42.550
of every new place I go.

01:02:44.385 --> 01:02:46.137
Wow, those are terrific.

(Sydney)'That's Machu Picchu.'

01:02:47.513 --> 01:02:50.975
One of the mostamazing places ever.

01:02:51.058 --> 01:02:53.394
And that's theGreat Wall of China.

01:02:54.479 --> 01:02:57.148
- The pyramids, of course.- Of course.

01:02:57.273 --> 01:03:00.151
And Mount Fuji of Japan.

01:03:00.234 --> 01:03:02.361
Alright, this is embarrassing.

01:03:02.487 --> 01:03:04.155
I've barely been anywhere.

01:03:04.238 --> 01:03:05.990
You've seen so muchof the world.

01:03:06.115 --> 01:03:07.575
Aw.

01:03:07.617 --> 01:03:11.329
Don't sell yourself short.Chicago is, like..

01:03:11.412 --> 01:03:13.456
It's a whole worldin itself.

'the very first momentthat I did.'

01:05:10.114 --> 01:05:13.451

Are you sayingyou're not gonna grab it?

01:07:31.380 --> 01:07:32.840
No, I-I-I guess, I just..

01:07:32.882 --> 01:07:35.259
I have to think about it,you know?

01:07:35.301 --> 01:07:36.427
Okay.

You work for ten yearsfor this

01:07:38.220 --> 01:07:39.597
and then you get it

[chuckles]That's okay.

01:08:36.487 --> 01:08:38.154
Um, it's not definite yet

01:08:38.238 --> 01:08:40.533
but, um, they need someoneto fill in pretty fast

01:08:40.573 --> 01:08:44.662
and they said that I'm basicallya shoo-in for the job

01:08:44.745 --> 01:08:46.872
if I can justget there by Christmas.

01:08:48.332 --> 01:08:50.501

It's just, uh..

01:09:00.301 --> 01:09:01.554
I guess, getting the newsright now

01:09:01.679 --> 01:09:04.265
feels like,a little overwhelming.

01:09:11.522 --> 01:09:14.774

01:09:15.776 --> 01:09:17.819

I just can't believeChristmas Eve is tonight.

01:10:05.618 --> 01:10:08.871

But we have Christmasto prepare for.

01:10:17.963 --> 01:10:21.425
I thought she wasn't leavinguntil Christmas day.

01:10:21.425 --> 01:10:23.761
She doesn't like us anymore?

01:10:23.886 --> 01:10:26.096
Oh, no, no.It's not like that.

01:10:26.096 --> 01:10:27.890

but it doesn't mean thatthey don't have an impact.

01:10:34.772 --> 01:10:36.398
What's an impact?

01:10:36.440 --> 01:10:39.443

01:10:44.406 --> 01:10:46.450
Will she be okay?

01:10:46.533 --> 01:10:47.910
I think so. Why?

01:10:47.993 --> 01:10:51.330

01:12:48.197 --> 01:12:50.908
Tsk. Yes, I am.

01:12:51.992 --> 01:12:54.787
But, um, I thinkI'm in pretty good company

01:12:54.912 --> 01:12:57.039
because, if Iremember correctly

01:12:57.122 --> 01:13:00.000
uh, somebody else flieson Christmas Eve.

01:13:00.084 --> 01:13:01.752

01:13:01.877 --> 01:13:04.296
- Oh, yeah.- Santa. Yeah.

01:13:04.421 --> 01:13:05.422
And if I see him

01:13:05.589 --> 01:13:09.009

01:13:15.432 --> 01:13:16.934
[clearing throat]

01:13:17.601 --> 01:13:19.812
I, um..

01:13:21.939 --> 01:13:25.192
Sorry, I'm not really goodat saying goodbye.

01:13:26.151 --> 01:13:29.363
(Leah)'Then let's say in Italian.'

01:13:30.322 --> 01:13:32.032
Arrivederci.

01:13:38.831 --> 01:13:40.290
[chuckles]

[humming]

01:14:21.707 --> 01:14:24.835
- Hey, you okay?- Huh? Oh, yeah. I'm fine.

01:14:24.918 --> 01:14:27.129
Sure about that?

01:14:27.171 --> 01:14:29.840
Well, if I told you the truth,you'd just say, "I told you so."

01:14:29.840 --> 01:14:32.092
No, I-I won't, I promise.

01:14:32.134 --> 01:14:34.887
But let me guess.It's about Sydney?

01:14:35.012 --> 01:14:37.556
Come on.I'll buy you an eggnog.

01:14:39.099 --> 01:14:40.851
Thanks for not saying,"I told you so."

01:14:40.976 --> 01:14:42.269
I don't careabout being right.

01:14:42.311 --> 01:14:44.563
- I just want you to be happy.- I know.

01:14:44.688 --> 01:14:45.856
She's really leaving, huh?

01:14:45.939 --> 01:14:49.735
Yeah. She got offeredher dream job in Rome.

01:14:49.860 --> 01:14:51.445
Uh-huh.And she took it?

01:14:51.528 --> 01:14:53.155
Yeah.

01:14:54.698 --> 01:14:56.867
Did you tell herhow you felt?

01:14:57.701 --> 01:14:59.620
Let's say, I do tell herhow I feel

01:14:59.661 --> 01:15:02.122
and let's say...she feelsthe same way.

01:15:02.206 --> 01:15:03.540
I-I don't know if Leah's ready.

01:15:03.665 --> 01:15:07.211
Leah or you? Maybe you'rethe one who is up in the air.

01:15:07.336 --> 01:15:08.795
But to be happy,you have to be ready

01:15:08.879 --> 01:15:11.173
to finally move on in life.

01:15:11.256 --> 01:15:12.341
Are you?

01:15:12.424 --> 01:15:14.760
[cell phone buzzing]Oh, maybe this is Sydney.

01:15:14.885 --> 01:15:16.553
It's my editor.

01:15:17.721 --> 01:15:19.598

Merry Christmas.

01:15:26.939 --> 01:15:29.107

01:15:29.233 --> 01:15:31.485

01:15:31.568 --> 01:15:32.694
Yeah.

01:15:33.779 --> 01:15:35.405
Can you watch Leahthis afternoon?

01:15:35.447 --> 01:15:36.740
Sure. Why?

01:15:36.865 --> 01:15:38.617
Well, the column's done,but I promised Sydney

01:15:38.659 --> 01:15:40.118
that I'd find outhow her parents met

01:15:40.244 --> 01:15:42.120
and I haven'tdone that yet.

01:15:42.246 --> 01:15:45.082
Okay.Sounds good.

01:15:45.123 --> 01:15:47.918
Leah, come on, let's go.

01:16:05.686 --> 01:16:07.020
Mm.

01:16:12.609 --> 01:16:15.612
[instrumental music]

01:16:32.587 --> 01:16:35.132
Sydney, there you are.

01:16:35.716 --> 01:16:36.633
Kerry.

01:16:36.633 --> 01:16:37.801
- Hi.- Hi.

01:16:37.801 --> 01:16:39.052
How are you? Mmm.

01:16:39.094 --> 01:16:42.597
I got in at midnight,I slept like a log.

01:16:42.681 --> 01:16:44.850
What do you say we grabsome peppermint mochas

01:16:44.975 --> 01:16:46.101
and then headto the airport?

01:16:46.184 --> 01:16:49.354
Sure. I could usea sympathetic ear.

01:16:49.479 --> 01:16:51.273
You got it.

01:16:52.065 --> 01:16:55.319
[indistinct chatter]

01:17:07.080 --> 01:17:09.625

(man on PA)'Okay, skaters, ten more minutesof free skating'

01:17:20.719 --> 01:17:23.430
'till we clear the icefor hockey practice.'

01:17:23.513 --> 01:17:25.098
"Hockey."

01:17:32.856 --> 01:17:36.193
Excuse me? Hey, did they sayhockey's gonna take the ice?

01:17:36.193 --> 01:17:37.736
Just for a couple of hours.

01:17:37.778 --> 01:17:39.529
Christmas Pairs Competitionis tonight.

01:17:39.571 --> 01:17:43.033
Oh. How long have they beendoing that competition?

01:17:43.033 --> 01:17:44.868
For as long as I can remember.

01:17:44.910 --> 01:17:46.203
[sighs]

01:17:50.123 --> 01:17:51.416
Hey, it's Jonathanin Features.

01:17:51.541 --> 01:17:53.710
Can I talk to Jeremyin Archives?

01:17:53.835 --> 01:17:55.587
Thanks.

01:17:55.629 --> 01:17:57.172
Hey, Jeremy.

01:17:57.255 --> 01:17:58.548
We need to look througharchives again.

01:17:58.632 --> 01:18:01.343
It's a long shot,but I got a hunch.

01:18:01.385 --> 01:18:04.137
Look, I knowit's Christmas Eve.

01:18:04.221 --> 01:18:06.348
I'll head down there myself.

01:18:09.059 --> 01:18:10.477
I know you've hada whirlwind week

01:18:10.560 --> 01:18:14.648
but Rome will be a wholenew chapter for you, right?

01:18:14.689 --> 01:18:15.774
Yes.

01:18:15.816 --> 01:18:17.192
I hope so.

01:18:17.275 --> 01:18:20.112
I mean, and one thing you neverhave to think about ever again

01:18:20.153 --> 01:18:22.948
is jetlag every timeyou want to see somewhere new

01:18:23.073 --> 01:18:24.449
in Europe or Africa

01:18:24.491 --> 01:18:28.078
'cause you'll just beone or two time zones away.

01:18:28.120 --> 01:18:29.413
That's why I love you.

01:18:29.538 --> 01:18:31.623
You always knowhow to cheer me up.

01:18:31.748 --> 01:18:33.542
It's my pleasure.

01:18:33.625 --> 01:18:34.584
And, you know, I get it.

01:18:34.751 --> 01:18:37.754
Jonathan sounds likea really great guy.

01:18:37.796 --> 01:18:39.381
He is.

01:18:41.716 --> 01:18:44.261
Oh, speaking of..

01:18:44.344 --> 01:18:46.430
I think his articlemight be out by now.

01:18:46.555 --> 01:18:47.764
Ooh.

01:18:47.848 --> 01:18:49.599
Ah. So exciting.

01:18:50.267 --> 01:18:52.144
"A Christmas Story."

01:18:53.353 --> 01:18:56.398
- Oh, your cab's here.- Oh.

01:18:56.481 --> 01:18:59.651
- Send it to me, okay?- I will.

01:19:01.069 --> 01:19:02.821
- Oh.- Oh.

01:19:02.946 --> 01:19:04.948
[both laughing]

01:19:05.073 --> 01:19:06.366
(Kerry)I'm excited for you.

01:19:06.408 --> 01:19:08.285
- Promise you'll come see me?- Of course!

01:19:08.285 --> 01:19:09.870
- Soon?- That's a given.

01:19:09.953 --> 01:19:11.872
[laughing]Oh, you better.

01:19:16.960 --> 01:19:19.212
(Jonathan) For most folks, the days up till Christmas

01:19:19.296 --> 01:19:21.965
are about searching for trees,  treats and gifts.

01:19:21.965 --> 01:19:23.425
But for one hometown girl

01:19:23.467 --> 01:19:25.093
it was a different kind of search

01:19:25.177 --> 01:19:27.179
for a Christmas story of her own.

01:19:27.220 --> 01:19:29.681
A search to discover how her parents

01:19:29.806 --> 01:19:33.643
Steve and Josephine met, one Chicago Christmas

01:19:33.643 --> 01:19:35.187
a long time ago.

01:19:37.856 --> 01:19:40.901
[mellow music]

01:19:54.664 --> 01:19:57.709

01:20:15.018 --> 01:20:17.604
[music continues]

01:20:18.855 --> 01:20:21.358
And, in the end, while we may never know the story

01:20:21.441 --> 01:20:23.151
of how Steve and Josephine met

01:20:23.193 --> 01:20:24.361
they will always be a part

01:20:24.444 --> 01:20:26.071
of Sydney's Christmas story

01:20:26.112 --> 01:20:28.365
and the memories we found along the way.

01:20:28.406 --> 01:20:30.867
Our Christmas memories are like lights on a tree

01:20:30.951 --> 01:20:33.620
each one that lights up, illuminates a moment

01:20:33.703 --> 01:20:36.706
of happiness past and happiness future.

01:20:36.790 --> 01:20:40.001
And these are the lights that guide us home.

01:20:43.004 --> 01:20:44.214

01:20:44.214 --> 01:20:47.509

[airplane droning]

01:21:18.123 --> 01:21:19.583
Jonathan?

01:21:20.292 --> 01:21:21.585
Sydney.

01:21:21.710 --> 01:21:24.838
You're supposed to beat 35,000 feet up there.

01:21:24.921 --> 01:21:27.007
Yeah.But, I'm here.

01:21:28.008 --> 01:21:29.384
And why are you here?

01:21:29.467 --> 01:21:31.428
I came to take a peekat the pairs skating.

01:21:31.428 --> 01:21:33.221
They're having it tonight.

01:21:33.263 --> 01:21:36.099
Jonathan, I read your column.

01:21:36.141 --> 01:21:38.101
I loved it.

01:21:38.226 --> 01:21:40.395
Especially, the ending.

01:21:42.689 --> 01:21:43.982
May I?

01:21:44.774 --> 01:21:46.610
Sure.

01:21:46.693 --> 01:21:48.904
"Our search endedatop a gazebo

01:21:48.987 --> 01:21:51.281
"where countless othershave stood.

01:21:52.240 --> 01:21:53.700
"Gazing out at the city

"twinkling with a millionmemories and moments

01:21:58.163 --> 01:22:01.917
and maybe that's a giftin itself."

01:22:04.127 --> 01:22:05.587
Thank you.

01:22:08.632 --> 01:22:11.051
I had to come back hereand see..

01:22:12.135 --> 01:22:14.512
...the gazeboone last time.

01:22:16.306 --> 01:22:19.517
The thing is, I've beento so many amazing places

01:22:19.643 --> 01:22:21.811
and I guessI never expected

01:22:21.895 --> 01:22:26.942
to feel such a specialconnection with just one..

01:22:27.943 --> 01:22:29.319
...place.

01:22:29.361 --> 01:22:30.904
'And I do.'

01:22:31.446 --> 01:22:33.365
This is home.

01:22:34.658 --> 01:22:38.203
Um, Sydney,can I tell you something?

01:22:38.244 --> 01:22:41.873
Um, the thing about reporters iswe never give up

01:22:41.915 --> 01:22:44.793
and I did some diggingand I found something.

01:22:44.876 --> 01:22:48.338
- Found what?- It's a Christmas gift for you.

01:22:48.380 --> 01:22:49.589
A story, actually.

01:22:49.673 --> 01:22:51.174
(man on PA)'Hockey's winding up shortly.'

01:22:51.299 --> 01:22:54.344
'Pairs, ten minutesand the ice is yours.'

01:22:54.427 --> 01:22:57.347
About a young womanwho loves to skate.

01:22:57.472 --> 01:23:01.434
And she, uh, would practiceright here at this very rink.

01:23:01.476 --> 01:23:03.186
But one year,when she came to rehearse

01:23:03.311 --> 01:23:05.063
for the ChristmasPairs Competition

01:23:05.188 --> 01:23:07.315
her partner cancelled.

01:23:07.399 --> 01:23:10.193
She was sodisappointed because..

01:23:10.276 --> 01:23:12.821
...after all,dancing was her passion..

01:23:12.862 --> 01:23:14.280
...on the ice and off.

01:23:14.322 --> 01:23:15.740
Go on.

01:23:15.865 --> 01:23:17.242
A hockey player

01:23:17.367 --> 01:23:19.869
saw her on that gazebo.

01:23:19.953 --> 01:23:22.372
He worked ata Christmas tree farm.

01:23:22.414 --> 01:23:24.249
And he was exhaustedat the end of the day

01:23:24.290 --> 01:23:25.792
but he saw how muchit meant to her

01:23:25.875 --> 01:23:29.254
so he volunteeredto be her skating partner.

01:23:29.379 --> 01:23:31.631
Now, he wasn't muchof a dancer..

01:23:32.590 --> 01:23:34.384
...but he knew the ice.

01:23:34.426 --> 01:23:36.720
And with her help,after a couple of weeks

01:23:36.803 --> 01:23:39.973
they skated circlesaround the competition.

01:23:40.015 --> 01:23:42.475
E-even a sprained ankledidn't stop him

01:23:42.517 --> 01:23:46.062
from winningthe competition..

01:23:46.146 --> 01:23:48.148
...and fromfalling in love.

01:23:48.189 --> 01:23:49.899
But how do you knowall of this?

01:23:49.983 --> 01:23:51.735
It's all in this article,my associate and I

01:23:51.735 --> 01:23:53.570
'dug up from the archives.'

01:23:53.570 --> 01:23:55.196
I was gonna mail it to Rome.

01:23:55.280 --> 01:23:57.657
'It ran as a human intereststory in the paper'

01:23:57.741 --> 01:23:59.743
'with a little backgroundof how your folks met.'

01:23:59.868 --> 01:24:01.369
First names only,and that's why

01:24:01.411 --> 01:24:03.037
it didn't show up earlier.

01:24:03.079 --> 01:24:05.540
'Josephine and Steve.'

01:24:06.041 --> 01:24:07.542
Wow.

01:24:09.294 --> 01:24:10.503
Mom and dad.

01:24:10.587 --> 01:24:13.339
Jonathan, this is the bestChristmas present

01:24:13.423 --> 01:24:15.759
that you could ever give me.

01:24:15.759 --> 01:24:18.470
Well, I'm glad you like it.

01:24:18.595 --> 01:24:20.764
- But I'm sorry.- For what?

01:24:20.889 --> 01:24:23.099
Well, now, I've made youmiss two flights.

01:24:23.183 --> 01:24:24.893
[chuckles]

01:24:26.227 --> 01:24:30.398
This is one planeI am so not sorry to miss.

01:24:30.482 --> 01:24:34.736
And, you know,Chicago is a hub..

01:24:34.819 --> 01:24:36.738
...and..

01:24:36.821 --> 01:24:40.116
...a great home basefor adventures.

01:24:40.200 --> 01:24:41.618
Are you sure?

01:24:41.743 --> 01:24:44.454
Nobody's ever confusedChicago with Rome.

01:24:44.454 --> 01:24:46.372
No, they haven't.

01:24:46.456 --> 01:24:48.124
But, um, you may not know this

01:24:48.249 --> 01:24:50.126
but the pizza'stop-notch here.

01:24:50.168 --> 01:24:51.336
That's true.

01:24:51.461 --> 01:24:54.506
And...if it's Chicago

01:24:54.631 --> 01:24:58.468
then...it'll be likecoming home.

01:24:58.593 --> 01:25:02.889
Would you like to hang outwith Leah and I this evening?

01:25:02.972 --> 01:25:05.975
We're gonna drink some eggnog,and sing some carols.

01:25:06.017 --> 01:25:08.144
I mean, unless you've gotsome other Christmas plans.

01:25:08.269 --> 01:25:10.480
Nothing wouldmake me happier.
