BEEN CAMPING ONCE

THAT CALL.

00:34.968 --> 00:36.137
[muttering in agreement]

00:36.137 --> 00:37.571

AND I DON'T WANT TO CANCEL
THE NEXT CONCERT

00:50.151 --> 00:51.985
BECAUSE YOU'VE BEEN EATEN

YOU WERE GOING CAMPING.

02:32.820 --> 02:34.955
- WELL, ACCORDING TO GUSTAVO,

02:34.955 --> 02:37.024
WE'RE NOT ALLOWED TO BE ONE

03:39.620 --> 03:41.154
NOT BAD.

03:41.154 --> 03:42.923

03:50.331 --> 03:51.799
- WHERE DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE GOING?

03:51.799 --> 03:52.933
- CAMPING.

03:52.933 --> 03:53.934
- WITH WHO?

03:53.934 --> 03:57.838
- YOU.

03:57.838 --> 03:58.972
- NO.

03:58.972 --> 04:00.140
I HATE CAMPING.

04:00.140 --> 04:01.575
I LIKE BEDS.
BEDS ARE NICE.

04:01.575 --> 04:02.843
WOODS ARE NOT NICE.

04:02.843 --> 04:05.713
- BUT WE'RE CAMPING OUT FRONT
OF THE BIG BUY.

04:05.713 --> 04:07.180
THE ISLAB 3
GOES ON SALE TOMORROW,

04:07.180 --> 04:09.149
AND I NEED TO CAMP OUT
TO MAKE SURE I GET ONE.

04:09.149 --> 04:10.518

- BUT, MOM, I'VE BEEN GOOD.

04:11.919 --> 04:14.322

04:19.092 --> 04:21.128
THE MAD LOOK WON'T WORK, EITHER.

[adventurous music]

04:32.440 --> 04:34.241
SUCH A GOOD SPEECH.

- WELL, YOU ALWAYS SAY,
DO GOOD THINGS,

04:36.844 --> 04:39.347
AND GOOD THINGS WILL HAPPEN.

04:39.347 --> 04:40.481
[music deflates]

- LIKE I ALWAYS SAY,
QUIT YOUR YAMMERING,

ALL NIGHT LONG.

WE DID A CAMPING EPISODE

04:48.856 --> 04:50.458
WHERE WE GOT ATTACKED
BY ZOMBIES,

04:50.458 --> 04:53.026
AND A VAMPIRE BEAR SAVED US.

04:53.026 --> 04:54.227
both: YOU SCARED?

04:54.227 --> 04:55.763

04:57.598 --> 04:59.467
[dramatic violin music]

04:59.467 --> 05:01.469
- THIS IS NOTHING LIKE CAMPING.

05:03.070 --> 05:06.374
- IT'S CAMPING HOLLYWOOD STYLE.

05:06.374 --> 05:09.577
- STAY THERE.

05:19.086 --> 05:21.855
OKAY, HOW'S THAT?

05:21.855 --> 05:24.892
- WELL, WE WANTED TO SLEEP
UNDER THE STARS.

05:26.727 --> 05:29.229
- [gasps]
- HEY.

05:29.229 --> 05:30.998
- WE ALSO WANT TO SEE
THE SUNRISE

05:30.998 --> 05:33.967
AND WAKE TO THE SWEET SOUNDS
OF THE LOONS.

05:35.903 --> 05:37.237
- YEAH, I CAN'T DO THAT.

05:37.237 --> 05:38.406
- GAH!

05:38.406 --> 05:39.873
- OKAY, IT'S IMPRESSIVE,

05:39.873 --> 05:42.410
BUT IT'S MISSING
THAT ELEMENT OF DANGER.

05:42.410 --> 05:43.711
- DANGER.

05:43.711 --> 05:45.413
- WHO IS THAT?

ANYONE THERE?

06:04.798 --> 06:07.435
I AM NOT ALLOWED TO BRING ANYONE
ON SET WITHOUT CLEARANCE,

06:07.435 --> 06:10.771
SO STAY AWAY
FROM THE WEEKEND WATCH PERSON.

06:10.771 --> 06:13.206
- BOYS ON THAT SIDE
OF THE LOG...

06:13.206 --> 06:14.808
all: GIRLS ON THIS SIDE.

06:16.209 --> 06:18.111
- [laughs]
LOVE OUR SIDE.

06:18.111 --> 06:19.480
LOVE IT.

06:19.480 --> 06:22.349
- AND DON'T EVEN THINK
ABOUT ASKING US FOR HELP.

06:22.349 --> 06:25.619
all: DON'T ASK US FOR HELP.

06:25.619 --> 06:27.287
- CARLOS,
YOU'RE ON THE WRONG SIDE.

06:30.624 --> 06:31.559
- YEAH.

06:35.829 --> 06:38.899
- WELL, THE GPS WE PUT IN
THE GUYS' CAMPING GEAR WORKED.

06:38.899 --> 06:40.801
- THEY WENT TO BEAR GULCH?

06:40.801 --> 06:43.637
- ACTUALLY, THEY WENT
TO COLOSSAL STUDIOS,

06:43.637 --> 06:45.038
STAGE 27.

06:45.038 --> 06:46.907
I CALLED THE STUDIO,
AND THEY INFORMED ME

06:46.907 --> 06:48.642
THAT IT'S HALF-FULL
WITH A CAMPING SET.

06:48.642 --> 06:50.243
- I SAID NO CAMPING!

06:50.243 --> 06:52.713
- ACTUALLY, YOU SAID
NO CAMPING OUTDOORS.

06:52.713 --> 06:56.884
- MY DOGS UNSUPERVISED
ON A SOUND STAGE?

06:56.884 --> 06:58.486
THEY COULD GET HURT!

06:58.486 --> 07:00.788
- OH, MY GOSH.

07:00.788 --> 07:02.022
YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT THEM.

07:02.022 --> 07:04.925
- OH, YEAH,
I'M WORRIED ABOUT THEM.

07:04.925 --> 07:06.894
YEAH, ME?
OH, YEAH.

07:06.894 --> 07:08.395
YEAH, YOU KNOW WHAT
I'M WORRIED ABOUT IS

07:08.395 --> 07:09.863
THAT THEY'RE GONNA
LOSE THEIR ARMS,

07:09.863 --> 07:12.833
AND THEN HOW WILL THEY HOLD
THEIR MICROPHONES?

07:12.833 --> 07:14.935
OKAY, CALL COLOSSAL STUDIOS

07:14.935 --> 07:18.005
AND TELL THEM WE WANT A TOUR
OF THE LOT FOR A VIDEO SHOOT.

07:18.005 --> 07:21.274
BUT WHAT WE'RE ACTUALLY GONNA DO
IS BREAK INTO THAT SOUND STAGE

07:21.274 --> 07:24.512
AND CUT THOSE GUYS'
CAMPING TRIP SHORT.

07:24.512 --> 07:25.813
BOOYA!

07:42.295 --> 07:45.533
- EARTH, STARS,
AND A SLEEPING BAG.

07:45.533 --> 07:46.700
IT'S ALL YOU NEED.

07:46.700 --> 07:49.136
- YEAH, BUT THE GIRLS
ARE KIND OF NICE.

07:49.136 --> 07:51.271
- HEY, THEY ARE JUST GONNA
SLOW US DOWN.

07:51.271 --> 07:52.806
- WE'RE GONNA END UP
SPENDING ALL NIGHT

07:52.806 --> 07:54.808
TRYING TO HELP THEM SET UP
CAMP--AND WHAT'S THAT SMELL?

07:54.808 --> 07:55.843

SOME APPLE SAUSAGE?

08:00.313 --> 08:01.414
all: YUP!

08:01.414 --> 08:02.550
- NO!

08:02.550 --> 08:04.685
BECAUSE WHEN WE CAMP,

08:04.685 --> 08:07.120
WE LIKE TO FORAGE OFF THE LAND.

08:08.221 --> 08:09.356
NOW, WHAT WE GOT?

08:09.356 --> 08:11.592
- I FOUND...

08:11.592 --> 08:14.061
FOUR DIRTY MINTS
AND A MUSTARD PACKET.

08:20.901 --> 08:22.169
[triumphant trumpet fanfare]

08:22.169 --> 08:23.771
- IT'S A PROP TURKEY.

08:23.771 --> 08:26.206
- YEAH.
THAT'S WHAT THE MUSTARD'S FOR.

08:28.375 --> 08:30.811
- GUYS, COME ON.
YOU HAVE NO FOOD.

08:30.811 --> 08:33.581
- WELL, THAT'S THE WAY
WE LIKE TO CAMP--

08:33.581 --> 08:34.915
HUNGRY,

08:34.915 --> 08:36.950
READY FOR ANYTHING.

08:36.950 --> 08:38.886

- WHO'S THAT?

08:42.590 --> 08:44.357
[wind gusting]

08:44.357 --> 08:45.593
- A STORM'S A'COMING.

08:45.593 --> 08:47.094
- IT'S THE AIR CONDITIONING.

08:47.094 --> 08:50.030
IT KICKS ON TO KEEP ALL
THE EQUIPMENT COOL OVERNIGHT.

08:51.298 --> 08:53.901
- OKAY, SO WHAT,
IT STAYS ON ALL NIGHT?

08:56.403 --> 08:59.372
- BUT YOU GUYS BROUGHT
EXTRA LAYERS, RIGHT?

08:59.372 --> 09:01.642
- LAYERS?
- [chuckles]

09:01.642 --> 09:04.745
- WE ONLY NEED ONE LAYER
TO STAY WARM.

09:04.745 --> 09:05.913
- THANK YOU.

09:09.182 --> 09:10.618
- WHY ARE THEY LOOKING AT US
LIKE THAT?

09:10.618 --> 09:13.486
- THEY LOOK LIKE GIANT WORMS.
- UH-HUH.

09:16.890 --> 09:19.660
- WHY YOU ARE WAITING IN LINE
IF YOU ALREADY HAVE AN ISLAB?

09:19.660 --> 09:23.130
- UGH,
BECAUSE THE ISLAB 2 IS OLD,

09:23.130 --> 09:25.532
AND THE ISLAB 3 IS NEW.

09:51.024 --> 09:53.526

BIG BUY'S OVERNIGHT LINE POLICY
IS FIRST COME, FIRST SERVE.

09:57.364 --> 09:59.299
AND I WAS HERE FIRST.

09:59.299 --> 10:00.801

OF LIFE IS,

10:00.801 --> 10:02.335
IF YOU'RE GREAT-LOOKING
WITH SNACKS,

10:02.335 --> 10:04.604
YOU CAN DO ANYTHING YOU WANT.

10:04.604 --> 10:07.374

10:07.374 --> 10:10.243
AND NOW YOU'RE 21st IN LINE.

10:10.243 --> 10:11.178
- WHOOP.

10:16.684 --> 10:20.287
- OKAY, NOW THEY'RE
JUST MOCKING US.

10:20.287 --> 10:22.489
- THIS IS GUSTAVO'S FAULT.

10:22.489 --> 10:25.358
HE SHOULD'VE JUST LET US CAMP
IN REAL WOODS LIKE WE WANTED.

10:25.358 --> 10:26.526
- OH, IF HE WAS HERE,

10:26.526 --> 10:28.929
I WOULD TOTALLY GIVE HIM
A PIECE OF MY MIND.

10:28.929 --> 10:30.330
- YEAH!
- MY FAULT?

10:30.330 --> 10:31.732
THEY'RE THE ONES
THAT ARE FREEZING

10:31.732 --> 10:33.166
AND ARE GONNA CATCH A COLD.

10:33.166 --> 10:34.802

10:34.802 --> 10:36.403
AN ACTUAL CARING PERSON
RIGHT NOW.

10:36.403 --> 10:37.838
- OH, YEAH.

10:37.838 --> 10:40.040
THE ONLY THING I WANT TO DO
IS CUT THIS CAMPING TRIP SHORT.

10:40.040 --> 10:41.508
BUT HOW?

10:41.508 --> 10:43.343
- WHY DON'T GUYS JUST ADMIT
THAT YOU'RE WRONG

10:43.343 --> 10:44.511
AND COME AND GET WARM?

10:44.511 --> 10:46.579
- AND COME FAKE-ROAST
MARSHMALLOWS WITH US?

10:46.579 --> 10:48.882
- CAN WE PLEASE GO GET
SOME MARSHMALLOWS?

10:48.882 --> 10:49.883
PLEASE?

10:49.883 --> 10:51.218
- NOPE.

10:51.218 --> 10:53.420
'CAUSE THANKS TO
SOME MANLY FORAGING,

10:53.420 --> 10:56.156
WE CAN START A REAL FIRE.

HOLLYWOOD STYLE!

11:13.974 --> 11:15.108
- WET!

11:15.108 --> 11:17.310
- COLD!
- HUNGRY!

11:17.310 --> 11:20.180
- GUYS, JUST GET OUT
OF THE WET SLEEPING BAGS,

11:20.180 --> 11:21.281
COME OVER HERE...

11:21.281 --> 11:22.649
all: GET SOME FOOD...

11:22.649 --> 11:24.317
- AND SOME HEAT.

11:24.317 --> 11:26.754
- WE ARE MEN OF THE WILD,

11:26.754 --> 11:28.789
AND IF THE WILD IS
A HOLLYWOOD SOUND STAGE,

11:28.789 --> 11:31.458
THEN WE WILL CONQUER IT
WITHOUT GIRL HELP.

11:31.458 --> 11:32.760
- WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

11:32.760 --> 11:34.161
- IT MEANS
THERE'S GOT TO BE

11:34.161 --> 11:36.296
A KITCHEN OR A PANTRY
AROUND SOMEWHERE.

11:36.296 --> 11:37.597
- RIGHT.

11:37.597 --> 11:39.967
CARLOS AND I WILL SEARCH
THE WILDERNESS FOR PROVISIONS.

11:39.967 --> 11:42.803
- AND LOGAN AND I WILL FIND
WARM, DRY CLOTHES AND BLANKETS.

11:42.803 --> 11:44.571
- ALL RIGHT, LET'S ROLL.

11:44.571 --> 11:47.340
I MEAN HOP.

11:49.910 --> 11:51.111
- EXCELLENT.

11:51.111 --> 11:53.781
THE DOGS HAVE LEFT THE WILD
ON THEIR OWN.

11:53.781 --> 11:56.116
- BUT NOW THEY'RE OUT WANDERING
ON A STUDIO LOT.

11:56.116 --> 11:57.117
- [gasps]
YOU'RE RIGHT!

11:57.117 --> 11:58.151
SOMETHING COULD HAPPEN TO THEM!

11:58.151 --> 11:59.652
THEY COULD GET HURT!

11:59.652 --> 12:03.156
- WHAT HAS GOTTEN INTO YOU?

12:03.156 --> 12:04.557
- COME ON, SWEETHEART.

12:04.557 --> 12:07.895
YOU'RE 21st IN LINE,
AND THEY ONLY HAVE 20 ISLABS.

12:07.895 --> 12:11.999
- YOU'RE GONNA LET THEM GET AWAY
WITH CUTTING ME OUT OF LINE?

12:11.999 --> 12:14.567
- THEY WILL NOT GET AWAY
WITH THIS,

12:14.567 --> 12:17.437
BECAUSE BAD THINGS HAPPEN
WHEN YOU DO BAD THINGS.

12:17.437 --> 12:19.172
SO LET'S GO SLEEP
IN OUR BEDS TONIGHT,

12:19.172 --> 12:21.274
AND THEY WILL GET
PAINFUL SKIN RASHES.

12:21.274 --> 12:22.843
- OH, I WON'T GET A RASH,

12:22.843 --> 12:25.578
'CAUSE I USE LANOLIN OIL
AFTER I BATHE.

12:25.578 --> 12:26.947
- WE CAN'T LEAVE NOW.

12:26.947 --> 12:28.281
A STORM COULD ROLL IN,

12:28.281 --> 12:29.682
OR IT COULD GET REALLY COLD,

12:29.682 --> 12:32.552
AND PEOPLE WOULD LEAVE THE LINE,
THEN I WOULD MOVE UP.

12:32.552 --> 12:35.255
- OH, ACCORDING TO MY ISLAB,
THE FORECAST FOR TONIGHT

12:35.255 --> 12:39.827
IS SUNNY AND WARM WITH NO CHANCE
OF YOU GETTING AN ISLAB 3.

12:39.827 --> 12:42.229
- OKAY, LET'S GO.

12:42.229 --> 12:43.296
- NO.

12:43.296 --> 12:45.365
I HAVE DONE GOOD THINGS.

12:45.365 --> 12:46.834
I VOLUNTEER.

12:46.834 --> 12:49.502
I RETURNED THAT WALLET I FOUND
AND LEFT THE MONEY IN IT.

WHERE'S THIS BIG

12:51.471 --> 12:53.273
YOU KEEP TELLING ME ABOUT, MOM?

12:53.273 --> 12:56.844

12:56.844 --> 12:57.911
'CAUSE WE'RE STAYIN'.

13:08.588 --> 13:10.090
- OKAY, OKAY.

13:10.090 --> 13:14.127
PREPRODUCTION, FINANCE...

13:14.127 --> 13:17.097
JACKPOT!

13:17.097 --> 13:18.231
IT'S LOCKED.

13:18.231 --> 13:21.401

AND THERE ARE NO DOORS
IN THE WILD.

THAT'S A NICE DRESS.

13:42.890 --> 13:44.892
HEY, DID YOU FIND ANYTHING YET?

13:44.892 --> 13:46.459

- WELL, IT DOESN'T ALWAYS
HAPPEN INSTANTLY.

14:38.145 --> 14:41.181
IT COULD COME IN THE FORM
OF AN IRS AUDIT

14:41.181 --> 14:43.250
OR A RACCOON ATTACK
WHEN THEY'RE 60.

14:43.250 --> 14:44.717
[laughter]

14:44.717 --> 14:47.020
- WELL, I CAN'T WAIT THAT LONG.

14:47.020 --> 14:50.023
AND A STINK BOMB IN THEIR TENT
WILL GET THEM OUT OF LINE

14:50.023 --> 14:51.959
AND GET ME AN ISLAB 3.

14:51.959 --> 14:53.961

REALLY BAD CAMPERS.

WILL BE CHARGED WITH TRESPASSING

15:38.138 --> 15:39.872

15:42.175 --> 15:44.677
- WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO TO ME?

15:44.677 --> 15:47.614
- I MIGHT HOLD YOU CAPTIVE
TILL MORNING.

15:47.614 --> 15:49.016
I MIGHT CALL THE POLICE.

15:49.016 --> 15:51.118

16:11.238 --> 16:13.040
- WAIT.
YOU CAN'T FIND LOGAN?

16:13.040 --> 16:14.941
- WELL, HE WAS IN A BEAR SUIT.

16:14.941 --> 16:16.076
