WEBVTT

00:00.423 --> 00:02.343
I am on cloud nine.

00:02.368 --> 00:04.604
Another afternoon
rendezvous with Brett.

00:04.629 --> 00:07.647
And I am buzzing with
romance and macchiatos.

00:07.649 --> 00:09.499
Hey, listen, I've been
meaning to talk to you

00:09.501 --> 00:11.634
about something, but I
didn't know how to say it

00:11.636 --> 00:13.603
without possibly freaking you out.

00:13.639 --> 00:14.738
Oh, God. Here we go.

00:14.773 --> 00:16.706
Webbed toes? Money problems?

00:16.708 --> 00:18.525
Or worse... bisexual?!

00:19.594 --> 00:21.260
- Go ahead?
- Okay.

00:21.262 --> 00:25.581
I was wondering if you wanted
to go to the Sia concert with me.

00:25.583 --> 00:26.716
That's it?

00:26.718 --> 00:28.685
Okay, that's not the freak-out part.

00:28.687 --> 00:31.554
Um, I was wondering if
you wanted to go with me

00:31.556 --> 00:34.058
as my... boyfriend.

00:35.461 --> 00:36.459
Yeah.

00:36.461 --> 00:37.978
S-Sure. Yeah.

00:37.979 --> 00:39.445
And sure... to both.

00:39.447 --> 00:41.447
I would...

00:41.449 --> 00:43.416
love to see Sia with you.

00:43.418 --> 00:46.603
I will see ya there at Sia.

00:46.604 --> 00:48.604
Works both ways, bu you don't, right?

00:49.691 --> 00:51.658
Okay, bye.

00:51.659 --> 00:53.843
Don't freak out. You got this.

00:53.845 --> 00:55.996

02:59.771 --> 03:02.021
This is a ticket to a Sia concert

03:02.023 --> 03:03.589
that my boyfriend got me.

03:03.591 --> 03:04.607
"What did you say?"

03:04.609 --> 03:06.293
"My boyfriend!"

03:06.294 --> 03:08.994
- Dude, I never thought it would happen.
- Right?

03:08.996 --> 03:10.235
Not because you're not awesome,

03:10.237 --> 03:12.765
but because for a desperate
guy, you're pretty picky.

03:12.767 --> 03:14.405
Okay, I really need
your support right now.

03:14.407 --> 03:16.541
I'm about to go break the
boyfriend news to Mom and Dad.

03:16.543 --> 03:18.554
They'll be fine. They
already know you're gay.

03:18.556 --> 03:20.423
I've only been gay with myself.

03:20.425 --> 03:22.742
I've never gotten to be
gay with another person.

03:22.743 --> 03:24.773
And Mom gets upset when I
even mention the thought

03:24.775 --> 03:26.262
of marrying Anderson Cooper.

03:26.264 --> 03:28.387
Okay. I have good news to tell them.

03:28.388 --> 03:30.683
Right? So I tell them my good news,

03:30.685 --> 03:32.084
then you tell them your news,

03:32.086 --> 03:33.837
and then they won't even hear it.

03:33.862 --> 03:34.744
Mm.

03:34.769 --> 03:36.523
What news could you possibly have

03:36.524 --> 03:38.774
that would eclipse
me having a boyfriend?

03:38.776 --> 03:41.360
I scored over 1,000 on my SATs.

03:41.362 --> 03:43.112
You whaaat?!

03:43.114 --> 03:44.670
That is such great
news! Aren't we happy?

03:44.671 --> 03:45.837
Nothing could ruin this moment.

03:45.839 --> 03:47.700
- I also have news.
- Shh. Hang on, Kenny.

03:47.702 --> 03:48.802
I have so many questions.

03:48.804 --> 03:50.186
What? H-How? Why?

03:50.188 --> 03:52.872
Shannon has been tutoring
me for the past few months.

03:52.874 --> 03:54.905
That doesn't sound like
something Shannon would do

03:54.906 --> 03:56.308
out of the kindness of her heart.

03:56.310 --> 03:57.376
It's not.

03:57.378 --> 03:59.195
I did it because you
promised Jimmy a car

03:59.197 --> 04:00.747
if he broke 1,000 on his SATs.

04:00.748 --> 04:03.148
And one day, his car's
going to be my hand-me-down.

04:03.150 --> 04:04.267
Wait. Hang on.

04:04.269 --> 04:05.826
We did not promise to get Jimmy a car.

04:05.827 --> 04:07.191
Hey, I feel like we're
veering off course.

04:07.193 --> 04:08.693
Maybe we could circle back to my news?

04:08.695 --> 04:10.723
I knew you would react this way.

04:10.725 --> 04:13.125
If I get over 1,000 on the SATs,

04:13.127 --> 04:14.844
then you guys promise
to buy me a car?

04:19.300 --> 04:20.966
Go ahead and fast-forward a little bit.

04:25.907 --> 04:28.208
Fine. We will get you a car.

04:28.209 --> 04:30.342
Do you think it's good
to have role models

04:30.344 --> 04:31.460
who break their promises?

04:31.462 --> 04:33.746
Or who laugh at your hopes and dreams?

04:33.748 --> 04:35.820
Pat, can I whisper-argue with you
over here for a second, please?

04:35.822 --> 04:37.683
What the hell was that?!

04:37.685 --> 04:38.856
I thought you had good news.

04:38.858 --> 04:40.536
I do. I'm getting a car.

04:40.538 --> 04:42.222
Okay, that's not good for me.

04:42.223 --> 04:43.355
It's great for me.

04:43.357 --> 04:45.391
All right, your mother
and I have decided

04:45.393 --> 04:46.892
to uphold our promise.

04:46.894 --> 04:49.645
You can get a new used car.

04:49.647 --> 04:51.698
- And I'm going with you to buy it.
- Wha...?

04:51.699 --> 04:55.184
- You two turkeys would get
swindled in a heartbeat. - Hey!

04:55.186 --> 04:57.822
Pat, your biggest flaw is that
you're just too nice to people.

04:59.224 --> 05:00.790
He is.

05:00.792 --> 05:02.308
He's the nicest one.

05:02.310 --> 05:04.611
He's the nicest one in our family.

05:04.612 --> 05:05.711
Up yours!

05:05.713 --> 05:06.712
I'm nice!

05:06.714 --> 05:08.064
Owww-wuh!

05:09.101 --> 05:11.434
- Hey, Dad.
- Hey.

05:11.436 --> 05:14.687
Wow. Your tiny house makes
that sandwich look very large.

05:14.689 --> 05:17.123
Mm. It's a hoagie, and it serves four.

05:17.124 --> 05:20.793
While I have ya, I have
some pretty big news.

05:20.795 --> 05:24.263
And I'm only telling you
and not Mom because...

05:24.265 --> 05:25.906
you're the cool parent.

05:27.419 --> 05:29.969
I have a boyfriend. His name is
Brett. I want you to meet him.

05:29.971 --> 05:31.343
I hope you like him,
because if you like him,

05:31.344 --> 05:32.877
then Mom will like
him, and since I like him,

05:32.879 --> 05:35.307
it's important that
you all like him, too.

05:35.309 --> 05:37.843
Well, of course I'm
gonna like him, Kenny.

05:38.913 --> 05:40.629
All right, buddy, your first boyfriend!

05:40.631 --> 05:42.014
- Yeah.
- Ooh, I get to do

05:42.016 --> 05:43.588
my "What are your
intentions with my son?" bit.

05:43.590 --> 05:44.950
Oh, wow.

05:44.952 --> 05:47.353
Or we could... you... Maybe
we could not do that?

05:50.491 --> 05:52.191
Test-driving cars is fun.

05:52.193 --> 05:53.409
And she drove like a dream.

05:53.411 --> 05:56.429
I can't wait to
parallel-park her brains out.

05:56.430 --> 05:57.930
Calm down, Jimmy.

05:57.932 --> 05:59.048
One whiff of enthusiasm,

05:59.050 --> 06:00.933
and they know they've
got you on the hook.

06:00.935 --> 06:03.369
This is about establishing
who's in charge, all right?

06:03.371 --> 06:05.988
And if all else fails...

06:05.990 --> 06:06.973
we have this.

06:06.974 --> 06:08.007
What?!

06:08.009 --> 06:09.242
Are we rich?!

06:09.243 --> 06:11.761
Yo, can we make it rain?!

06:11.763 --> 06:13.580
You see how you just reacted?

06:13.581 --> 06:15.814
That's what cash does to
people. It makes them stupid.

06:15.816 --> 06:17.183
So...

06:17.185 --> 06:19.052
We gonna get you in
that car today, J-man?

06:19.053 --> 06:21.086
Yeah! I love her!

06:21.088 --> 06:22.271
It's just... stupid.

06:22.273 --> 06:23.806
Mm, yeah, she's cool.

06:23.808 --> 06:25.798
All right, well, I mean, the
car has everything you want.

06:25.799 --> 06:27.393
And, uh, this is the best I can do.

06:27.395 --> 06:28.194
Okay.

06:28.195 --> 06:30.613
Oh! Yeah.

06:30.615 --> 06:32.665
- This is perfect.
- Mm-hmm.

06:32.667 --> 06:34.567
For me to spit my gum into.

06:34.568 --> 06:36.419
Wha... We're leaving.

06:36.421 --> 06:37.904
And we're taking our cash with us.

06:37.905 --> 06:38.837
Come on, Jimmy.

06:38.839 --> 06:40.142
Is that why we stopped for gum?

06:40.144 --> 06:40.957
M-Mo...

06:41.860 --> 06:42.808
Oh.

06:42.810 --> 06:44.693
You have nothing to be nervous about.

06:44.695 --> 06:47.563
My dad is very, very
excited to meet you.

06:47.565 --> 06:49.966
I'm actually more nervous abou
him embarrassing me

06:49.967 --> 06:51.050
with his lame jokes.

06:52.053 --> 06:53.237
Hey, guys.

06:54.473 --> 06:55.621
I should tell you...

06:55.623 --> 06:57.756
It's so validating going
to these gay places.

06:57.758 --> 06:59.725
A guy just asked me
out and gave me a scone.

06:59.727 --> 07:01.660
That's 'cause he's got good taste.

07:01.662 --> 07:03.395
- How you doing?
- Hi. I'm Brett.

07:03.397 --> 07:05.181
Brett, Pat O'Neal. Nice to meet you.

07:05.183 --> 07:08.635
Ooh. Nice handshake.
Firm but not a showoff.

07:08.636 --> 07:09.785
All right.

07:09.787 --> 07:11.554
Have a seat, Brett.

07:11.556 --> 07:13.789
Kenny has, uh, told me a lot about you.

07:13.791 --> 07:15.074
Oh, really?

07:15.076 --> 07:17.410
Did he tell you that I'm the
cool parent? Because I am.

07:19.864 --> 07:22.015
But not too cool.

07:23.468 --> 07:25.257
Now, I don't want you bringin' our boy

07:25.258 --> 07:27.125
back to the homestead in
the middle of the night.

07:27.127 --> 07:27.903
You got me?

07:27.905 --> 07:29.321
Here he goes.

07:29.323 --> 07:32.441
So, what exactly are your
intentions with my son?

07:32.443 --> 07:34.744
Um... nothing out of the ordinary.

07:34.745 --> 07:37.830
And I can promise you I will
not get him pregnant, sir.

07:41.153 --> 07:43.007
Wait. You
guys are having sex already?

07:43.009 --> 07:44.998
What? No! No.

07:45.023 --> 07:47.506
He was making a joke 'cause
you were doing a thing!

07:47.508 --> 07:50.493
And we're two dudes.
That's not possible.

07:50.495 --> 07:53.580
I think what Brett is trying to say is,

07:53.581 --> 07:55.013
it's great to meet you.

07:55.015 --> 07:56.715
It really is, Pat.

07:56.717 --> 07:59.051
I think "Mr. O'Neal" is
going to be just fine.

08:02.959 --> 08:04.212
Kenny! Hi!

08:04.214 --> 08:05.763
Hey. What are you guys doing here?

08:05.765 --> 08:08.366
Well, Steve the colorist and
I are on our afternoon 15,

08:08.368 --> 08:09.984
which ended an hour ago.

08:09.986 --> 08:11.202
We're so bad.

08:12.605 --> 08:14.855
Both we work on commission,
so it's really our loss.

08:16.109 --> 08:17.241
I can't pay my rent.

08:20.596 --> 08:21.796
What are you up to, buddy?

08:21.798 --> 08:23.097
Boyfriend drama.

08:23.099 --> 08:24.231
You have a boyfriend?

08:24.233 --> 08:25.900
I remember my first boyfriend.

08:25.902 --> 08:26.984
He died.

08:26.986 --> 08:28.669
Well, this is way worse.

08:28.671 --> 08:31.556
Dad and Brett's first
meeting... Super-awkward.

08:31.558 --> 08:33.607
Oh, they were probably
both just nervous.

08:33.609 --> 08:35.515
You know what brought
Steve and I closer together?

08:35.517 --> 08:36.861
An escape room.

08:36.863 --> 08:38.096
What is that?

08:38.097 --> 08:40.780
An escape room is a locked
space filled with puzzles

08:40.783 --> 08:42.332
that you have to solve to get out.

08:42.335 --> 08:44.519
It's a great bonding
experience for a group...

08:44.521 --> 08:46.838
Unless, of course, someone is useless.

08:46.840 --> 08:47.905
I'm claustrophobic.

08:47.907 --> 08:50.091
And bad with puzzles.
And numbers. And groups.

08:50.093 --> 08:50.975
Mm.

08:50.977 --> 08:52.693
Wait. That sounds perfect.

08:52.695 --> 08:53.961
Dad is great with numbers,

08:53.963 --> 08:55.768
Brett is great with puzzles,
and I'm great with groups.

08:55.770 --> 08:57.904
Just make sure that you don't
volunteer to be the group leader.

08:57.906 --> 09:00.173
Otherwise, somebody could
strangle you out of frustration.

09:00.175 --> 09:01.836
You found a clue, di't you?

09:03.723 --> 09:04.956
Clive. Clive.

09:08.929 --> 09:10.144
Hey.

09:10.146 --> 09:11.751
Geez, they got you
working on a Saturday, huh?

09:11.753 --> 09:13.564
Oh, yeah, just supervising detention.

09:13.566 --> 09:16.317
Lot of these students,
they're throwaway kids.

09:16.319 --> 09:18.319
Nobody cares about them, but... I do.

09:18.321 --> 09:19.837
Hey! Scagnetti!

09:19.839 --> 09:21.596
Don't worry about
what's going on out here!

09:21.598 --> 09:23.991
Worry about where your
life's going! Nowhere!

09:23.993 --> 09:26.077
What can I do you for, Pat?

09:26.079 --> 09:28.613
I need your advice, but
you cannot tell Eileen.

09:28.615 --> 09:30.731
I'm terrible at keeping secrets.

09:30.733 --> 09:31.949
Kenny has a boyfriend,

09:31.951 --> 09:33.206
and he wanted me
to meet him and not Eileen

09:33.208 --> 09:34.841
because I'm supposed
to be the cooler parent,

09:34.843 --> 09:36.376
but I was not cool,
Clive... Far from it!

09:36.378 --> 09:37.343
Why did you tell me that?

09:37.345 --> 09:38.956
Now I know Kenny has a boyfriend.

09:38.958 --> 09:40.808
What?

09:40.810 --> 09:41.826
What are you doing?

09:41.828 --> 09:43.978
I am texting Eileen,
"Kenny has a boy..."

09:43.980 --> 09:45.952
- You got to take the phone away from me!
- Clive, I need you to focus!

09:45.954 --> 09:47.665
I'm spinning out here, okay?

09:47.667 --> 09:49.289
What if I don't like Brett
because I just don't like

09:49.291 --> 09:51.318
the idea of seeing Kenny with a boy?

09:51.320 --> 09:52.537
Am I a homophobe?

09:52.539 --> 09:53.905
You are not a homophobe.

09:53.907 --> 09:55.540
You love white wine.

09:57.477 --> 09:58.876
It's Kenny.

09:58.878 --> 10:00.700
He wants me to come and meet
up with him and Brett again.

10:00.702 --> 10:02.680
See? He's giving you a second chance.

10:02.682 --> 10:04.782
That's the key... Getting to know them,

10:04.784 --> 10:07.618
realizing these kids,
there's goodness in all of...

10:07.620 --> 10:09.187
Hey! Scagnetti!

10:09.189 --> 10:11.110
So help me, the last
thing you see in this world

10:11.112 --> 10:12.290
will be this detention room.

10:12.292 --> 10:14.108
And no one will care!

10:14.110 --> 10:15.376
Yeah! Ooh! Ooh!

10:15.378 --> 10:16.382
Do you need to go handle that?

10:16.384 --> 10:18.729
Nah, nah. Can lock them in.

10:19.899 --> 10:21.988
Come on, Pat. Let's go make
friends with a young boy.

10:24.771 --> 10:26.554
So, what kind of car did we get?

10:26.556 --> 10:29.874
Oh! Nothing! Zip! Zilch! Nada! Bonjour!

10:29.876 --> 10:31.325
Because after every test-drive,

10:31.327 --> 10:33.266
Mom would break the salesman
down to the brink of tears.

10:33.268 --> 10:35.179
None of the cars fit our parameters.

10:35.181 --> 10:36.263
And those men were weak.

10:36.265 --> 10:37.481
What were your parameters?

10:37.483 --> 10:38.666
Nothing crazy.

10:38.668 --> 10:40.534
Just has to fit into our budget

10:40.536 --> 10:41.886
and have everything on that list.

10:41.888 --> 10:44.922
A latch system for infant car seats?

10:44.924 --> 10:47.108
You never know when a
baby's gonna need a ride.

10:47.110 --> 10:48.859
You can't get all of
this for that price.

10:48.861 --> 10:51.412
Exactly! She was never
gonna let me buy a car!

10:51.414 --> 10:52.980
This is like that time that you told me

10:52.982 --> 10:54.721
that I could go to the
moon for my birthday.

10:54.723 --> 10:56.016
There is no moon!

10:56.018 --> 10:57.251
Jimmy.

10:57.253 --> 10:59.170
There's moon.

10:59.172 --> 11:00.354
Look, if you feel

11:00.356 --> 11:02.489
you can negotiate those
terms for my price,

11:02.491 --> 11:04.358
you're more than welcome to try it.

11:04.360 --> 11:05.392
Here.

11:05.394 --> 11:06.894
I trust you with this.

11:06.896 --> 11:08.295
Like an adult.

11:12.552 --> 11:14.734
- Want me to hold that for you, buddy?
- Yes, please.

11:14.759 --> 11:15.752
'Kay.

11:16.490 --> 11:17.789
Aah!

11:18.992 --> 11:21.092
Thank you, Shannon.

11:26.148 --> 11:27.965
It was a foul, dark night

11:27.967 --> 11:31.636
when old Mr. Newman found his wife dead.

11:31.638 --> 11:34.372
You have one hour to escape the room

11:34.374 --> 11:38.143
and find the murderer before
he returns for you.

11:39.910 --> 11:42.113
Thank you for doing this with me.

11:42.115 --> 11:45.333
Now that I have your attention, sleuths,

11:45.335 --> 11:47.118
the teams that escape with their lives

11:47.120 --> 11:50.788
are the ones who assign a
leader and work together.

11:50.790 --> 11:53.024
This is your chance.
Let Brett be the leader.

11:53.026 --> 11:55.609
Show him you're respectful.
Let my dad be the leader.

11:55.611 --> 11:56.916
- You be the leader.
- You can be the leader.

11:56.918 --> 11:58.829
No, really, you should be the leader.

11:58.831 --> 12:01.448
- All right, wonderful.
- No, no, I insist.

12:01.450 --> 12:02.566
Let him be the leader.

12:02.568 --> 12:04.485
Ooh! A plot twist. Here you are.

12:04.487 --> 12:06.404
No, you should be the
leader. You're older.

12:06.406 --> 12:07.688
What's that supposed to mean?

12:07.690 --> 12:09.740
Like, more experienced.

12:09.742 --> 12:10.941
Fine. I'll do it.

12:10.943 --> 12:13.066
I'm actually really good at
solving puzzles and stuff.

12:13.068 --> 12:14.534
- Excellent.
- Oh, well, on second thought,

12:14.536 --> 12:17.364
I am a cop, and I have
solved several puzzles myself,

12:17.366 --> 12:18.307
called crimes.

12:18.332 --> 12:21.218
Guys, I'm auditioning for
"Pippin" in like two hours,

12:21.220 --> 12:22.953
so I'm starting the clock either way,

12:22.955 --> 12:24.956
and you just figure it out.

12:26.493 --> 12:28.342
Ooooh!

12:31.247 --> 12:32.163
Hey.

12:32.165 --> 12:35.215
So, I ran my algorithm,

12:35.217 --> 12:37.101
and unless we're willing
to fly to Germany,

12:37.103 --> 12:39.203
I can't find anything
that fits Mom's criteria.

12:39.205 --> 12:40.705
It's a fool's errand.

12:40.707 --> 12:44.058
Well, this fool is about
to go on an errand to get a car.

12:44.060 --> 12:45.943
I met a nice man named
Ranger on Craigslist

12:45.945 --> 12:47.567
who has the perfect car
that fits our budget.

12:47.569 --> 12:49.669
Oh. My Uber's here. I got to run.

12:49.671 --> 12:52.038
Ranger is waiting for me in an
alley behind the Dollar Store

12:52.040 --> 12:53.740
on the South Side, and
I don't want to be late.

12:53.742 --> 12:55.553
So... give me the cash?

12:55.555 --> 12:57.088
On one hand, I'm suspect.

12:57.090 --> 12:59.424
On the other hand, I really
hate riding on the bus.

13:06.195 --> 13:07.247
Here you go.

13:07.249 --> 13:08.215
Wait a minute.

13:08.217 --> 13:09.550
What's going on here?

13:09.552 --> 13:10.723
I'd rather not talk about it.

13:10.725 --> 13:12.570
Is that one of my Hot Wheels?

13:15.533 --> 13:16.757
I'm onto you, Shannon.

13:23.383 --> 13:25.366
Okay, guys, as your default leader,

13:25.368 --> 13:27.768
I am happy to report that we are close

13:27.770 --> 13:29.904
to solving our first clue.

13:29.906 --> 13:31.902
So let's really think
about what this means, okay?

13:31.904 --> 13:35.309
"When the stars align,
the Earth will turn."

13:35.311 --> 13:37.194
I got nothing. I got nothing.

13:37.196 --> 13:38.996
It seems like if we work together,

13:38.998 --> 13:40.681
we can solve this puzzle,

13:40.683 --> 13:43.550
and maybe even the larger puzzle...

13:43.552 --> 13:44.752
Of us.

13:44.754 --> 13:47.688
Oh, hey. Maybe this star
has something to do with it.

13:47.690 --> 13:49.023
Here's the globe.

13:49.025 --> 13:50.324
Oh, can I have the star?

13:50.326 --> 13:52.826
Oh, you want to be the hero
who puts the star in the globe?

13:52.828 --> 13:55.929
Okay, it's the first clue.
Nobody's really the hero here.

13:55.931 --> 13:57.931
Here you go. I'm sure
you can figure it out.

13:57.933 --> 13:59.266
Oh, let's hope so.

13:59.268 --> 14:02.520
Just put the star in a star hole.

14:05.625 --> 14:07.608
If they don't figure
that out, it's all right.

14:07.610 --> 14:10.161
I'm actually just
about to pick this lock.

14:10.163 --> 14:13.064
Clive, that is a painting
of a lock on a fake door.

14:15.135 --> 14:16.517
Copy that.

14:16.519 --> 14:18.235
- Can I help you?
- I've got it!

14:18.237 --> 14:19.570
Okay, you know what, Dad?

14:19.572 --> 14:21.889
- Can I speak to you over by
the sconce, please? - Why?

14:21.891 --> 14:24.142
Maybe there's a clue. Just
come over to the sconce!

14:24.167 --> 14:25.943
Is the sconce real?

14:25.945 --> 14:27.144
I cannot tell what is real.

14:27.146 --> 14:29.396
Okay, Brett is working
very hard to impress you,

14:29.398 --> 14:31.015
and you're being totally rude.

14:31.017 --> 14:33.066
- No, I am not.
- Yes, you are.

14:33.068 --> 14:34.919
H-H-He has tried everything,

14:34.921 --> 14:36.520
and nothing has been good enough.

14:36.522 --> 14:38.077
The only thing I can think
of is that he's a boy.

14:38.079 --> 14:40.613
At least Mom has been honest about
her feelings from the beginning.

14:40.615 --> 14:42.648
Maybe you actually aren't
okay with me being with a guy.

14:42.650 --> 14:45.579
No, Kenny, that is not it. I am
very proud to have a gay son.

14:45.581 --> 14:46.853
And I have watched too many episodes

14:46.855 --> 14:48.321
of "Dancing With the
Stars" to be a homophobe.

14:48.323 --> 14:49.300
Okay, then what is it?

14:49.302 --> 14:50.668
I just don't like Brett!

14:51.738 --> 14:52.904
That was real.

14:54.915 --> 14:59.060
I can't believe you let Jimmy
buy a car off of Craigslist.

14:59.062 --> 15:01.117
You're the one who gave him
the envelope full of cash.

15:01.119 --> 15:02.485
Don't pin this on me, lady.

15:02.487 --> 15:04.982
Oh, I gave him awful advice.

15:04.984 --> 15:06.517
I taught him all my power moves,

15:06.519 --> 15:09.837
which is fine if you're talking
to Daniel at the dealership.

15:09.839 --> 15:12.340
But you can't spit your
gum at a man named Ranger.

15:12.342 --> 15:14.208
You spit your gum at somebody?

15:14.210 --> 15:16.944
Am I the only one who
understands the art of the deal?

15:16.946 --> 15:19.714
You must have seen one
decent car he could take to college.

15:19.716 --> 15:22.399
Well, yes, of course.
We saw dozens of cars.

15:22.401 --> 15:23.884
But...

15:23.886 --> 15:25.619
Jimmy needs a little extra protection.

15:25.621 --> 15:28.172
And I'm just worried that
out there in the world,

15:28.174 --> 15:29.897
people aren't gonna do that for him.

15:30.761 --> 15:33.194
Maybe you're just not
ready for him to leave.

15:35.599 --> 15:37.915
Well, I'm definitely not
ready for him to get mugged

15:37.917 --> 15:39.166
by a guy named Ranger.

15:39.168 --> 15:41.902
I should have given him my rape whistle.

15:41.904 --> 15:43.520
You have a rape whistle?

15:43.522 --> 15:44.655
You don't?

15:46.559 --> 15:48.659
Well, the last 30 minutes
of that escape room

15:48.661 --> 15:49.960
really flew by, huh?

15:49.962 --> 15:51.161
Still not talking to you.

15:51.163 --> 15:53.014
Kenny, come on!

15:54.484 --> 15:55.899
Ay-yi-yi.

15:55.901 --> 15:58.222
Well, thanks for coming,
buddy. Sorry it was such a bust.

15:58.224 --> 16:00.805
Oh, hey, I'd rather fail with
you than with Scagnetti.

16:00.807 --> 16:04.007
Oh, my God. I forgot about those kids.

16:04.009 --> 16:05.008
I better skedaddle.

16:05.010 --> 16:06.160
Plus, if I see Eileen,

16:06.162 --> 16:07.683
I'm gonna tell her
everything about today.

16:09.014 --> 16:10.064
It's her.

16:10.066 --> 16:12.233
It's not her. Clive, she lives here.

16:12.235 --> 16:13.835
- She wouldn't knock.
- Oh.

16:15.939 --> 16:17.138
Hi, Mr. O'Neal.

16:17.140 --> 16:19.473
"Mr. O'Neal."
Ethan, that was my dad.

16:19.475 --> 16:21.575
- You can call me Pat.
- Okay.

16:21.577 --> 16:23.533
I have Shannon's homework.
She left it at my house.

16:23.535 --> 16:24.795
Shannon's not home.

16:24.797 --> 16:26.981
Do you want me to leave it? Or take it?

16:26.983 --> 16:28.682
Or should I come back another time?

16:28.684 --> 16:30.373
Or maybe you want me to
leave it on the porch.

16:30.375 --> 16:31.335
If you have a rock...

16:31.337 --> 16:33.053
Ethan. Just give it to me.

16:33.055 --> 16:34.037
I'm sorry, sir.

16:34.039 --> 16:36.440
Now it's "sir"?

16:36.442 --> 16:37.847
You hear this little suck-up, Clive?

16:37.849 --> 16:39.115
This is who my daughter's dating.

16:39.117 --> 16:41.178
I think he's being quite respectful.

16:41.180 --> 16:43.214
Never had a child call me "sir"...

16:43.216 --> 16:44.821
Even this one, and
I'm his vice-principal.

16:44.823 --> 16:45.833
- Can I go now?
- No.

16:45.835 --> 16:47.551
You know, you think Brett's too casual,

16:47.553 --> 16:49.353
you think Ethan's too formal.

16:49.355 --> 16:51.205
You just don't like kids.

16:51.207 --> 16:53.056
That's ridiculous. I love kids.

16:53.058 --> 16:55.776
First of all, I like my
kids. I like the neighbor's kids.

16:55.778 --> 16:57.678
I even like that Allison
friend of Kenny's,

16:57.680 --> 16:59.230
and she's a real snooze fest.

16:59.232 --> 17:01.865
- Ugh. She is awful.
- Yeah.

17:01.867 --> 17:05.653
But none of those kids are
dating your kids.

17:07.790 --> 17:10.140
Son of a bitch. You're right.

17:13.244 --> 17:15.145
Stop! Our dad's a cop!

17:15.146 --> 17:16.512
What are you guys doing here?

17:16.515 --> 17:18.781
We're here to save you
from this sketchy lowlife.

17:18.784 --> 17:20.401
Mom! This is Ranger.

17:20.403 --> 17:22.090
He's moving to Omaha to
take care of his sick sister.

17:22.093 --> 17:23.159
That's why he's selling his car.

17:23.161 --> 17:24.939
Yeah, right! What does she have?

17:24.941 --> 17:26.223
Advanced lupus.

17:26.224 --> 17:27.491
Oh, God. I'm so sorry.

17:27.492 --> 17:29.626
So why'd you lure my
son into this alley?

17:29.628 --> 17:31.295
Because he's having his going-away party

17:31.297 --> 17:33.263
at a hipster warehouse right there.

17:34.900 --> 17:36.533
Oh. Yeah, I-I didn't see them.

17:36.535 --> 17:37.601
Hi.

17:37.603 --> 17:39.053
The car meets all your requirements.

17:39.055 --> 17:41.533
Does it have a latch system
for an infant car seat?

17:41.558 --> 17:42.547
Yes, ma'am.

17:42.572 --> 17:44.747
You never know when you're
gonna need to give a baby a ride.

17:44.749 --> 17:46.494
Well, I misjudged you.

17:46.496 --> 17:48.812
Oh, it's okay. I have a mom, too.

17:48.814 --> 17:51.849
She's all yours, kid.

17:54.453 --> 17:55.352
Yes!

17:55.354 --> 17:56.453
I did it!

17:56.455 --> 17:57.438
My first car!

17:57.440 --> 17:58.639
I used all your power moves.

17:58.641 --> 17:59.974
I'm very proud of you, Jimmy.

17:59.976 --> 18:02.062
You're gonna look great
driving that car to college.

18:02.064 --> 18:04.879
Maybe this baby bird's
ready to leave the nest.

18:06.216 --> 18:09.917
We're really gonna
miss having you around all the time.

18:09.919 --> 18:11.474
Don't... Don't you do that.

18:11.476 --> 18:13.337
You know that when
you cry that I cry.

18:15.307 --> 18:18.759
Eh. I guess I can have a feeling.

18:18.761 --> 18:19.977
You come here.

18:21.380 --> 18:24.615
Look, here's the point... Is...

18:24.617 --> 18:25.599
I'm your dad.

18:25.601 --> 18:27.551
It's my job to protect you.

18:27.553 --> 18:29.853
So nobody is ever gonna
be good enough for you.

18:29.855 --> 18:32.322
And especially since this is
your first real relationship,

18:32.324 --> 18:34.057
I'm setting the bar even higher

18:34.059 --> 18:36.844
because I know that
you deserve a great guy.

18:36.846 --> 18:38.529
I know, but Brett is a great guy.

18:38.531 --> 18:41.415
He's sweet and smart,
and he likes my dorkiness.

18:41.417 --> 18:43.767
He even likes my sense of humor,
that I got from you.

18:45.671 --> 18:46.788
I am pretty funny.

18:47.924 --> 18:50.991
So I am going to try with Brett, okay?

18:50.993 --> 18:53.043
Because I know how much he means to you.

18:53.045 --> 18:54.182
Thank you.

18:56.252 --> 18:59.500
Aaaaaaaaa... dorable.

18:59.502 --> 19:00.790
You're a real quiet
breather, aren't you?

19:01.737 --> 19:03.053
Yo, yo!

19:03.055 --> 19:06.840
Guess which Sagittarius is
the proud owner of a Taurus!

19:06.842 --> 19:09.877
Okay, Jimmy, for the last
time, you are a Virgo.

19:11.067 --> 19:12.313
Clive?

19:12.315 --> 19:13.648
I tried calling you today.

19:15.051 --> 19:17.518
Are you feeling all right? You look ill.

19:17.520 --> 19:19.386
Kenny has a boyfriend!

19:19.388 --> 19:20.604
I'm so sorry.

19:20.606 --> 19:22.205
He's just a friend who's a boy

19:22.207 --> 19:23.891
that he has sexual... chemistry with.

19:23.893 --> 19:25.509
Oh, no. They're the cutest couple!

19:25.511 --> 19:26.810
I can't stop!

19:30.282 --> 19:31.899
His name is Brett. He's a keeper.

19:31.924 --> 19:33.884
Can't tell you enough how sorry I am.

19:42.587 --> 19:45.128
I'm sorry you had to
find out that way, Mom.

19:45.130 --> 19:47.364
Me too.

19:47.366 --> 19:49.651
I was waiting for you to tell me.

19:51.189 --> 19:52.653
What?

19:52.655 --> 19:53.937
You knew this whole time?

19:53.939 --> 19:56.607
Of course I did. I'm not blind.

19:56.609 --> 19:58.914
I could see it when you were
singing into each other's eyes

19:58.916 --> 20:00.394
at the Christmas concert.

20:00.396 --> 20:02.896
And... And you're okay with it?

20:02.898 --> 20:05.115
I don't think I have a choice.

20:05.117 --> 20:07.951
I'll take that as you're okay with it.

20:07.953 --> 20:11.655
We can't stop you kids from growing up.

20:11.657 --> 20:13.040
But that's not gonna stop me

20:13.042 --> 20:14.625
from looking at your baby pictures

20:14.627 --> 20:16.343
and thinking about the good old days,

20:16.345 --> 20:18.178
when I made all the decisions.

20:18.180 --> 20:21.131
Well, hey, come on. Let's
go check out your ride.

20:21.133 --> 20:22.132
Oh! Shotgun!

20:22.134 --> 20:24.601
Oh, wait! I'm driving.

20:31.462 --> 20:33.558
Uh, I had a mild stroke.

20:33.583 --> 20:34.654
No, I used that last week.

20:34.656 --> 20:35.956
I'm just gonna speak off the cuff.

20:35.958 --> 20:38.386
I'm gonna talk from the
heart to these kids here.

20:38.388 --> 20:40.621
All righty.

20:40.623 --> 20:41.906
What?

20:41.908 --> 20:43.942
Son of a gun.

20:43.944 --> 20:46.360
Those damn throwaway
kids escaped tonight.

20:46.362 --> 20:48.080
No, no, no, no, no!

20:48.105 --> 20:50.064
Damn it, Scagnetti! I know this was you!

20:50.066 --> 20:51.805
Oh, God. I'm trapped again.

20:51.807 --> 20:53.467
- Come on! Scagnetti!
- Yeah!

20:53.469 --> 20:56.370
I'm gonna rip off your head
and down your neck!

20:56.372 --> 20:58.823
No, come on, guys! I'm
just fooling around!

20:58.825 --> 21:00.792
- Up yours, Murray!
- Hey, guys?
