WEBVTT

00:00.562 --> 00:01.710
Attention shoppers.

00:01.758 --> 00:03.914
It's Valentine's Day,
and love is in the air,

00:04.014 --> 00:06.867
along with dust, pet dander,
and toxic mold spores,

00:06.976 --> 00:10.170
so pick up a Supercloud air
purifier and convince yourself

00:10.195 --> 00:11.367
it's making a difference,

00:11.445 --> 00:13.666
which it's not, 'cause it's just a fan.

00:13.765 --> 00:15.304
- Excuse me, everyone.
- Dude.

00:15.421 --> 00:17.062
- You know what?
- I don't care.

00:17.197 --> 00:19.414
Two Aprils ago, I was new here,

00:19.492 --> 00:22.447
and someone special came over
to help me on register.

00:22.525 --> 00:26.853
And, Lisa, you didn't
just bag groceries.

00:26.908 --> 00:28.353
You bagged my heart.

00:28.416 --> 00:29.744
Ooh, this is a bad idea.

00:29.814 --> 00:32.595
Lisa Beth-Ann
Donatella Lopez-Fitzgerald,

00:32.689 --> 00:35.348
if you'll make me the luckiest
man in St. Louis,

00:35.442 --> 00:38.137
I'll show you the time of your life.

00:43.820 --> 00:46.851
This makes me genuinely sad.

00:47.078 --> 00:49.679
Flash mob proposals are so lame.

00:49.766 --> 00:51.242
Except for the one that Bo did for you.

00:51.296 --> 00:53.218
- That was unique and very cool.
- Yeah.

00:53.421 --> 00:57.257
Yeah, but flash mobs stopped
being cool, like, a year ago.

00:57.367 --> 01:00.539
Yeah, they were cool one year ago.

01:03.218 --> 01:05.328
Where's Lisa? We need Lisa.

01:05.437 --> 01:06.962
Where the [Bleep] is Lisa?

01:07.039 --> 01:09.250
She's in the bathroom.

01:09.726 --> 01:11.467
Is it a quick bathroom break or more

01:11.501 --> 01:13.671
of a hunker-down-watch-
YouTube-videos situation?

01:13.726 --> 01:16.031
Hard to say.
Her body language going in...

01:16.083 --> 01:17.450
oh, wait, here...

01:21.369 --> 01:22.945
Go back. Go back. Places, places.

01:23.109 --> 01:24.703
- Oh, God. Not again.
- Oh, wow.

01:24.850 --> 01:26.317
Take two, dude.

01:26.726 --> 01:30.753
<font color=#FF00FF>*SUPER STORE*</font>
<font color=#00FF00>Season 02 Episode 13</font>
<font color=#FFFF00>"Valentine's Day"</font>

01:31.114 --> 01:33.387
Front of store on the left.

01:33.591 --> 01:34.757
- Amy, Amy.
- Yeah.

01:34.957 --> 01:37.817
Tell me, do you think
that Brett and Brittany

01:37.925 --> 01:39.269
would be good together?

01:39.294 --> 01:40.911
I mean, it feels like there's
chemistry there,

01:40.981 --> 01:42.770
but it might just be the alliteration.

01:42.825 --> 01:44.684
- What, like, together-together?
- Yeah, yeah.

01:44.716 --> 01:46.153
I don't know. Why?

01:46.262 --> 01:50.156
'Cause I hired Miles and Lisa,
and now they're in love.

01:50.285 --> 01:52.636
You know, so I thought maybe
there's some other sad singles

01:52.723 --> 01:54.239
who'd like to get bitten by Cupid.

01:54.395 --> 01:56.661
An arrow. I think Cupid has an arrow.

01:56.716 --> 01:58.061
And he bites.

01:58.184 --> 02:00.270
And I don't think
that it's a good idea to go

02:00.325 --> 02:02.132
setting people up around work.

02:02.200 --> 02:05.731
Are you down on love because
of your bad marriage?

02:05.836 --> 02:08.833
No, I just don't think people
come here to find love.

02:08.902 --> 02:11.169
This is a workplace, not Match.com.

02:11.286 --> 02:12.692
What's Match.com?

02:12.755 --> 02:15.614
It's like Christian Mingle,
but for everyone.

02:15.700 --> 02:18.223
Oh! That is such a good idea.

02:18.319 --> 02:19.544
Mm-hmm.

02:25.923 --> 02:27.145
I'm sure it's her.

02:27.200 --> 02:28.848
Well, there's definite similarities.

02:28.933 --> 02:30.567
Slightly different BMIs,
but she could be on

02:30.614 --> 02:31.911
one of those crash diets.

02:32.052 --> 02:33.958
So what do we do next?
Do we... do we call the cops?

02:34.005 --> 02:35.832
Do we bust her ourselves?

02:35.866 --> 02:38.101
Easy, Cagney.

02:38.135 --> 02:39.501
We have to catch her in the act.

02:39.547 --> 02:41.137
Now, I'd have my
plainclothes guy tail her,

02:41.180 --> 02:42.333
but Tuesday's his day off.

02:42.520 --> 02:44.286
Ah, I wonder
what he wears on his day off.

02:44.387 --> 02:45.676
Fancy clothes probably.

02:45.715 --> 02:46.715
I could do it.

02:46.747 --> 02:48.471
I've always wanted to go undercover.

02:48.940 --> 02:49.963
You?

02:50.033 --> 02:53.165
Okay, yeah, you're way underqualified.

02:53.240 --> 02:54.983
What do you need to be qualified?

02:55.058 --> 02:56.596
You need to watch a video.

02:56.675 --> 02:58.547
I could watch a video.

02:59.267 --> 03:00.930
You could watch a video.

03:01.350 --> 03:03.984
You guys, look what Jeff just sent me.

03:04.312 --> 03:05.875
"My precious treasure,

03:05.945 --> 03:08.945
words cannot express my love for you.

03:09.062 --> 03:12.922
And I love seeing you naked,
because it's really good.

03:13.031 --> 03:14.625
Love, Mr. Man."

03:14.711 --> 03:16.992
Wow, Jeff sent you those.

03:17.017 --> 03:17.811
Mm-hmm.

03:17.836 --> 03:19.289
That's, like, a hundred-dollar bouquet.

03:19.359 --> 03:20.699
Yeah, or, like, 140.

03:20.774 --> 03:22.516
Seems so weird he'd send you
a gift at work when your

03:22.578 --> 03:24.177
relationship is supposed to be secret.

03:24.252 --> 03:26.412
I guess he really loves me, huh?

03:26.487 --> 03:28.374
- Yeah.
- Hey, Heather.

03:28.534 --> 03:30.167
Look what Jeff just sent me.

03:33.215 --> 03:35.314
Oh, we need more tissue paper.

03:37.376 --> 03:38.687
What's wrong with him?

03:38.987 --> 03:43.542
Well, it's because of a reason
that I... I can't tell you.

03:43.596 --> 03:44.775
Hmm, I actually don't care, so...

03:44.865 --> 03:46.823
Mateo's the one dating Jeff, okay?

03:46.877 --> 03:50.010
And Sandra is just making
it up to get attention.

03:50.573 --> 03:52.631
So Sandra has a fake boyfriend,

03:52.706 --> 03:54.841
she sent herself flowers,
and Mateo is dating Jeff?

03:54.916 --> 03:56.018
Yeah.

03:56.112 --> 03:57.956
This a quality Tuesday.

04:04.017 --> 04:05.588
Oh!

04:05.752 --> 04:06.784
Hello.

04:06.885 --> 04:08.495
Welcome to Cloud 9.

04:08.557 --> 04:12.401
And you must be the little
princess we've been expecting.

04:12.510 --> 04:15.151
Right this way, Your Highness.

04:18.135 --> 04:20.284
M...

04:24.385 --> 04:28.467
Hey, Arthur, I might be
totally off base here,

04:28.542 --> 04:31.143
but do you have a crush on Myrtle?

04:31.276 --> 04:33.321
Oh, no. I...

04:34.014 --> 04:35.648
well, maybe just a little crush.

04:35.723 --> 04:37.784
Oh, that's so sweet.

04:37.877 --> 04:40.987
I like to imagine the two
of us together someday

04:41.143 --> 04:42.924
- feeding the ducks...
- Ohh.

04:43.011 --> 04:44.731
Watching the ducks.

04:44.830 --> 04:46.135
It doesn't have to be ducks.

04:46.182 --> 04:48.823
No. It can be ducks.

04:52.049 --> 04:54.050
You're doing great.

04:55.451 --> 04:56.711
Good, good, good.

04:56.776 --> 04:58.964
Just keep thinking,
"Customer, customer."

04:59.039 --> 05:00.151
I'm shopping as a customer."

05:00.261 --> 05:02.488
- Okay, okay, thank you.
- All right.

05:08.248 --> 05:10.008
Hey, Jonah.

05:10.127 --> 05:13.912
Do you think Elias and Pauline
would be good together,

05:13.987 --> 05:16.589
or am I just projecting
Laurel and Hardy?

05:17.758 --> 05:21.205
I think you have me confused
with someone else.

05:21.860 --> 05:24.845
Oh, wow. I'm... I'm so sorry.

05:24.916 --> 05:27.967
I... you look exactly like
someone who works here.

05:28.042 --> 05:29.268
I'm so sorry.

05:31.973 --> 05:33.665
Wow, it's uncanny.

05:33.740 --> 05:35.682
And Bo's parents are out of town,

05:35.752 --> 05:38.837
so everyone's just gonna get waa-sted.

05:38.884 --> 05:41.548
What about you?
Any hot Valentine's Day plans?

05:41.573 --> 05:47.053
No, probably sit in the park,
feed the ducks.

05:47.151 --> 05:50.249
Ohh, that's so old person.

05:50.324 --> 05:53.581
You can come if you want,
but it's bring your own nitrous.

05:53.635 --> 05:56.120
Hey, Myrtle, do you date anymore?

05:56.190 --> 05:59.878
No, but if you know someone nice,

06:00.003 --> 06:01.128
set me up.

06:01.596 --> 06:03.792
He doesn't even have to be white.

06:11.479 --> 06:14.221
Arthur, we're switching
things up a bit today.

06:14.300 --> 06:17.116
I'm gonna have you tackle
Womenswear with Myrtle,

06:17.191 --> 06:19.557
and Cheyenne here is
gonna take your post.

06:19.651 --> 06:21.198
You want me to be a greeter?

06:21.292 --> 06:22.714
I'm not trained in that.

06:22.792 --> 06:24.987
You'll be fine. I believe in you.

06:25.057 --> 06:27.628
Hello. Welcome to Cloud 9.

06:27.892 --> 06:30.307
Ooh, yeah, I nailed that.

06:32.135 --> 06:35.050
Come on, you two. Talk to each other.

06:35.210 --> 06:37.278
It's not like either one of you
have that much time left.

06:37.353 --> 06:41.075
Hey. Oh, what is Arthur doing
in Womenswear?

06:41.150 --> 06:42.659
He's confused again.

06:42.721 --> 06:43.721
- I'll go fix it.
- No, no.

06:43.792 --> 06:46.885
No, Glenn, I put him there.

06:47.073 --> 06:48.026
Why?

06:48.159 --> 06:50.565
You know, just to mix things up,

06:50.614 --> 06:54.199
give people an opportunity to
work with other people and...

06:54.339 --> 06:56.598
Oh, I see.

06:56.673 --> 06:59.434
It's wrong when I try to do matchmaking,

06:59.509 --> 07:01.844
but you get to whip out the fangs, huh?

07:01.919 --> 07:03.510
- What fangs?
- Cupid's fangs.

07:03.589 --> 07:07.182
Glenn, again, an arrow. Never mind.

07:07.311 --> 07:08.690
Look, this is different.

07:08.765 --> 07:10.815
They're really perfect for each other.

07:10.870 --> 07:12.994
They are. They're both old.

07:13.069 --> 07:14.979
Yeah, and there's, like,
this whole duck thing,

07:15.026 --> 07:16.300
but mostly they're old.

07:16.378 --> 07:18.214
Why aren't they talking to each other?

07:18.272 --> 07:19.831
I don't know. He's really shy.

07:20.010 --> 07:21.666
It's like they need a bigger push.

07:21.741 --> 07:24.071
Yeah. Oh, hey, you see that guy?

07:24.146 --> 07:25.835
You think that's Jonah, right?

07:25.963 --> 07:27.393
It's not.

07:30.352 --> 07:32.079
This is so embarrassing.

07:32.154 --> 07:35.623
I always tell him, "Jeff,
you're gift enough for me,"

07:35.698 --> 07:37.517
but he won't listen.

07:37.592 --> 07:40.659
I'm not much of a romantic,
but this is special stuff.

07:40.768 --> 07:42.039
Whatever.

07:42.112 --> 07:44.691
Do you know how many babies choke
on balloons and die every year?

07:44.766 --> 07:46.333
I don't know, but it
seems like a few would.

07:46.408 --> 07:47.568
I'm just happy for Sandra.

07:47.643 --> 07:51.264
I mean, can you imagine what
it's like to have what she has?

07:51.339 --> 07:54.475
I mean, just to have a connection
like that with someone.

07:54.550 --> 07:56.310
I bet Jeff just loves it.

07:56.385 --> 07:58.640
30. 30 babies die.

08:11.460 --> 08:13.793
- Oh!
- Oh, my God. I'm so sorry.

08:13.818 --> 08:14.823
I'm so sorry.

08:14.848 --> 08:16.320
Ah, are you okay?

08:16.743 --> 08:19.347
Oh, yeah, no, happens all the time.

08:19.422 --> 08:21.320
Someone flies a drone into my head.

08:21.398 --> 08:24.260
Are you sure? 'Cause I can
give you a ride to the hospital.

08:24.335 --> 08:27.022
No way. I've seen how you drive.

08:27.757 --> 08:30.933
Well, I... I mean, I'm better
with the... the four wheels.

08:31.008 --> 08:32.515
Yeah, I'd hope so.

08:33.667 --> 08:36.234
This is why people hate Valentine's Day,

08:36.318 --> 08:38.320
you know, drone strikes.

08:38.414 --> 08:40.467
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah.

08:40.586 --> 08:42.553
Oh, welcome to Cloud 9.

08:43.039 --> 08:44.718
Welcome to Cloud 9.

08:45.549 --> 08:47.710
Cloud 9 welcomes you.

09:00.726 --> 09:02.390
That's right, chat her up.

09:02.515 --> 09:04.953
Just a normal person having
a normal conversation.

09:05.046 --> 09:07.406
Speak, listen, speak, listen.

09:07.431 --> 09:08.304
<i>Oh! my God.</i>

09:08.305 --> 09:10.734
Ooh, look at him getting some on V-Day.

09:11.042 --> 09:12.362
What are you talking about?

09:12.453 --> 09:13.718
He is undercover.

09:13.796 --> 09:15.867
He's just building a rapport
with the suspect.

09:15.953 --> 09:18.062
I mean, that's why they're
talking and laughing so much,

09:18.148 --> 09:19.421
standing so close.

09:19.507 --> 09:22.914
He just touched her elbow with his hand.

09:23.835 --> 09:25.335
- Anyway, do you want to...
- Huh.

09:25.421 --> 09:27.523
- She's late, like...
- There she is.

09:28.758 --> 09:31.232
Hey, Myrtle. Break time already, huh?

09:31.307 --> 09:32.120
Uh-huh.

09:32.195 --> 09:34.261
I love break time, great
time to kick back

09:34.336 --> 09:36.895
and see what's in the old locker, huh?

09:37.866 --> 09:39.786
Wh... what you got there?

09:40.437 --> 09:43.138
I don't think this is my locker.

09:43.213 --> 09:44.406
Yeah, it is.

09:45.057 --> 09:48.210
It just looks like someone left
you some flowers and chocolates

09:48.285 --> 09:49.411
and a duck.

09:49.486 --> 09:52.786
Wow. Who's it from?

09:53.123 --> 09:55.145
Well, look. Look for a card.

09:55.218 --> 09:56.344
Just look around. Look...

09:56.419 --> 09:57.319
look under that sweater.

09:57.394 --> 10:00.723
No, not your sweater.
He's not a magician.

10:02.859 --> 10:04.526
It's from Arthur.

10:04.601 --> 10:06.317
- Oh.
- Ohh.

10:06.432 --> 10:09.901
That's so sweet of him. That's so nice.

10:11.201 --> 10:12.575
Ohh.

10:12.880 --> 10:15.411
You don't have to cry, sweetie.

10:15.598 --> 10:17.856
He won't leave me alone.

10:18.065 --> 10:20.817
Why won't he leave me alone?

10:22.208 --> 10:23.434
Aah!

10:30.231 --> 10:32.841
So Myrtle has filed sexual
harassment complaints against

10:32.866 --> 10:34.559
Arthur as well as the two of you.

10:34.614 --> 10:36.051
That's crazy.

10:36.106 --> 10:37.539
We didn't harass her.

10:37.614 --> 10:39.811
She's alleging that you used
your positions of authority to

10:39.874 --> 10:42.247
force her to work with an
employee in hopes of engaging

10:42.325 --> 10:43.494
in a physical relationship with him.

10:43.561 --> 10:45.808
And she also claims you broke
into her locker.

10:45.883 --> 10:47.671
Now, what's your side of the story?

10:47.746 --> 10:50.823
Um, factually similar.

10:50.898 --> 10:53.119
Yeah, but you can prove
anything with facts.

10:53.194 --> 10:54.460
I mean, Darwin...

10:54.535 --> 10:56.970
She goes on to say that he
made lewd and profane comments.

10:57.045 --> 10:59.598
Arthur? He's so sweet.

10:59.673 --> 11:02.668
We had no idea what
he was saying to her.

11:02.743 --> 11:04.804
The security cameras don't have sound.

11:04.879 --> 11:07.147
I'm sorry, are you saying
that you were spying

11:07.222 --> 11:08.281
on them as well?

11:08.356 --> 11:10.532
No, spying makes it sound like

11:10.579 --> 11:12.285
we were trying to get information.

11:12.360 --> 11:14.521
We were just watching them
for our own pleasure.

11:14.596 --> 11:15.655
Stop talking, Glenn.

11:15.730 --> 11:17.123
Welcome to Cloud 9.

11:17.198 --> 11:19.025
Welcome to Cloud 9.

11:19.100 --> 11:22.608
Hey, it's Cloud 9 up in here.

11:23.531 --> 11:24.772
Jeff got her a watch.

11:24.847 --> 11:26.313
I would have liked a watch.

11:26.388 --> 11:28.241
But she sent it to herself.

11:28.316 --> 11:29.283
Yeah, I know she sent it to herself.

11:29.358 --> 11:30.376
I'm not stupid.

11:30.451 --> 11:32.753
You know, it's just sad that
she feels the need to...

11:32.828 --> 11:33.847
White gold?

11:33.922 --> 11:35.548
Oh, my God. That's her favorite.

11:35.623 --> 11:36.657
It's like he knows exactly
what she wants.

11:36.732 --> 11:38.284
Ohh.

11:38.359 --> 11:41.437
I thought space camp was just
gonna be all moon rocks

11:41.512 --> 11:43.664
and astronaut ice cream,
but it was basically

11:43.739 --> 11:45.558
just a bunch of science classes.

11:45.633 --> 11:48.468
But still, I'm... that's...
I'm so jealous of that.

11:48.543 --> 11:50.396
- Really?
- Yes, it's incredible.

11:50.471 --> 11:53.440
Meanwhile, according to the
absurd amount of decorations

11:53.515 --> 11:56.476
in this store,
I guess it's Valentine's Day.

11:56.551 --> 11:57.771
- Oh.
- Did you...

11:57.846 --> 11:58.946
did you see any of this?

11:59.021 --> 12:00.447
No, I hadn't noticed.

12:00.522 --> 12:03.650
So do you... do you have any plans or...

12:03.725 --> 12:08.815
Actually, yeah, I'm going to
an MMA fight with my boyfriend.

12:08.890 --> 12:11.458
Yeah, he's that muscly guy
right over there.

12:11.816 --> 12:12.861
Oh.

12:13.061 --> 12:15.220
- Oh, I didn't...
- So gullible!

12:15.299 --> 12:17.986
- I am gullible.
- Yes.

12:18.080 --> 12:20.064
So are you... are you free or...

12:20.174 --> 12:22.002
Yeah, I'm free.

12:22.148 --> 12:24.064
She's not the shoplifter.

12:24.439 --> 12:27.267
Really? Because you were
so certain of it earlier.

12:27.342 --> 12:29.476
I mean, you had
that dance-y energy you get.

12:29.551 --> 12:31.077
Oh, no, no, no. That was just...

12:31.152 --> 12:33.513
I had an extra shot
in my cold brew this morning.

12:33.588 --> 12:37.427
But seeing her up close,
the chin, the nose,

12:37.506 --> 12:39.012
that's a different person.

12:39.231 --> 12:40.768
Huh, well,

12:40.843 --> 12:43.119
I can't think of any reason
why you'd want to lie.

12:43.220 --> 12:45.852
So I guess you're
officially off the case.

12:45.924 --> 12:47.394
Thank you for your service.

12:47.469 --> 12:50.041
It was an honor and a pleasure.

12:52.331 --> 12:53.892
Attention shoppers.

12:53.967 --> 12:56.529
We just received a song dedication.

12:56.604 --> 12:59.599
This one goes out
to "Sandra, my one and only."

12:59.674 --> 13:01.181
"Happy Valentine's Day, Boo.

13:01.260 --> 13:03.595
Love, your Mr. Man."

13:12.345 --> 13:13.847
Hi, Myrtle.

13:13.922 --> 13:16.482
Look, I just... I want to say I'm sorry.

13:16.557 --> 13:18.058
I was totally out of line.

13:18.133 --> 13:22.429
He was saying such filth,
how much he liked my sweater.

13:22.504 --> 13:25.491
Oh, well, is that really that bad?

13:25.566 --> 13:28.602
He meant he liked
what's under my sweater.

13:28.677 --> 13:33.525
Okay, maybe, but maybe...
I don't know...

13:33.788 --> 13:37.503
it is possible that you
misunderstood what he said or...

13:37.578 --> 13:39.702
Oh, blame the victim.

13:39.777 --> 13:41.411
She's blaming the victim!

13:41.486 --> 13:42.865
No, no, no, no.

13:42.940 --> 13:44.040
I'm not blaming anyone.

13:44.115 --> 13:47.177
I'm just saying that maybe he
wasn't harassing you.

13:47.252 --> 13:48.804
It is a very nice sweater.

13:48.879 --> 13:50.880
It shouldn't matter what she's wearing.

13:50.955 --> 13:53.049
I'm sorry.
Who asked you to get involved?

13:53.124 --> 13:54.884
Sexual harassment involves us all.

13:54.959 --> 13:56.846
Okay, this isn't sexual...

13:56.921 --> 13:59.923
okay, I was just trying
to set her up for a date.

13:59.998 --> 14:01.651
Intent is irrelevant.

14:01.726 --> 14:02.993
Seriously, who are you people?

14:03.068 --> 14:04.453
Oh, we're not together.

14:04.528 --> 14:07.097
Oh, oh, 'cause a woman
couldn't possible be out on her

14:07.172 --> 14:10.459
own without a big, strong man,
'cause then she'd be a slut!

14:10.534 --> 14:12.361
Okay, none of you know the story.

14:12.436 --> 14:14.730
She asked me to set her up,
so I set her up.

14:14.805 --> 14:16.072
She was asking me for it.

14:16.147 --> 14:17.374
She asked for it.

14:19.944 --> 14:21.370
Sexual harassment.

14:21.445 --> 14:24.180
At what point is it inappropriate?

14:24.255 --> 14:26.982
Harassment is always wrong.

14:27.572 --> 14:29.439
If it starts in the break room,

14:29.514 --> 14:31.965
it shouldn't end in the bedroom.

14:32.040 --> 14:35.084
He's totally thinking about
boning Sandra right now.

14:35.159 --> 14:35.812
No, he's not.

14:35.887 --> 14:39.349
And fewer lawsuits equals
more revenue for Cloud 9,

14:39.424 --> 14:42.111
which benefits all of us.

14:42.186 --> 14:45.402
I'm sorry for making you
uncomfortable, Michelle.

14:45.477 --> 14:48.918
Oh, M.C.Cool Cloud, you are all right.

14:48.993 --> 14:50.699
Does anybody have any questions?

14:50.774 --> 14:52.606
No, I think we're all set here.

14:52.681 --> 14:55.418
Well, you can't take love out
of the workplace.

14:55.493 --> 14:56.722
Oh, God, kill me now.

14:56.819 --> 14:58.590
What about Miles and Lisa?

14:58.665 --> 15:01.480
If it was up to you, they never
would have gotten together.

15:01.567 --> 15:04.578
And then the children they're gonna
have would never have been born.

15:04.657 --> 15:06.936
Oh, we're... we're not having kids.

15:07.011 --> 15:08.604
- What?
- No one is saying

15:08.679 --> 15:11.147
you can't ever date somebody
you work with.

15:11.222 --> 15:14.009
Just be careful not to
make unwanted advances.

15:14.084 --> 15:17.587
So you can't ask someone out
unless you know they like you?

15:18.102 --> 15:19.736
But then you don't know
if someone likes you

15:19.811 --> 15:24.174
unless you ask them out,
so that's, like, a Catch-22.

15:24.249 --> 15:25.768
Whoa, well done.

15:25.843 --> 15:28.338
Oh, I've been studying for the SATs.

15:28.413 --> 15:31.048
It's been a very
extrapolatory experience.

15:31.123 --> 15:33.476
Okay, what we need is a database.

15:33.551 --> 15:37.347
Everybody write down all the
employees you're attracted to.

15:37.422 --> 15:38.681
Totally confidential.

15:38.756 --> 15:40.783
I will compile a
spreadsheet of any matches

15:40.858 --> 15:41.925
and post it above the microwave.

15:42.000 --> 15:43.453
Nope, we're not doing that.

15:43.528 --> 15:45.529
Let's just say that if
you ask somebody out,

15:45.604 --> 15:47.790
and they say no, move on.

15:47.865 --> 15:48.932
What if she just says no

15:49.007 --> 15:50.393
because she has plans that night?

15:50.468 --> 15:52.331
Can you ask her out again
for a different night?

15:52.406 --> 15:55.572
Umm. I guess. I mean, it depends.
Does she really have plans,

15:55.647 --> 15:58.368
or is she politely telling you
she's not interested?

15:58.443 --> 16:00.210
- Which one is it, Sarah?
- It's the second one.

16:00.285 --> 16:01.712
Whatever.

16:02.236 --> 16:04.000
I was just asking as a joke anyway.

16:04.075 --> 16:05.708
Without kids, what's the point of life?

16:05.783 --> 16:06.950
I can't believe you'd want
to bring someone

16:07.025 --> 16:08.552
into this crazy world.

16:08.627 --> 16:11.414
Sometimes people do change their minds.

16:11.489 --> 16:13.857
I mean, I met Jerusha
when we were both working

16:13.932 --> 16:16.127
at my father's hardware store.

16:16.202 --> 16:19.722
I asked her out every day for a year,

16:19.797 --> 16:21.231
and then she said yes.

16:21.306 --> 16:22.191
Aww.

16:22.266 --> 16:23.200
- Yes.
- Okay, actually,

16:23.275 --> 16:25.635
that's called a systemic
pattern of hostility.

16:25.710 --> 16:28.105
It's, like, the number
one thing you can't do.

16:28.180 --> 16:29.165
I got a question.

16:29.240 --> 16:31.817
The actress in the video,
does she get paid per video,

16:31.892 --> 16:34.578
or is it more of a flat rate
for the whole day kind of thing?

16:34.653 --> 16:37.206
My guess is flat rate.

16:37.281 --> 16:38.508
Can ignoring someone you're dating

16:38.583 --> 16:39.483
be considered harassment?

16:39.558 --> 16:41.611
- I don't think so.
- Of course you don't.

16:41.686 --> 16:43.253
I'm... I'm just not explaining it right.

16:43.328 --> 16:44.914
I wasn't harassing her.

16:44.989 --> 16:47.758
She agreed to go out with me
because my father threatened

16:47.833 --> 16:49.593
to fire her if she didn't.

16:49.668 --> 16:51.521
Myrtle, I'm so sorry.

16:51.596 --> 16:54.498
It was wrong to harass
you, and if you want,

16:54.573 --> 16:56.133
I will quit right now.

16:56.208 --> 16:58.461
- No, no, no.
- Yes, quit.

16:58.536 --> 16:59.669
Arthur is a lovely guy.

16:59.744 --> 17:01.671
He was just trying to compliment you.

17:01.746 --> 17:03.032
That's all it is!

17:03.107 --> 17:05.842
I like your sweater,
and I think you're pretty.

17:05.916 --> 17:08.278
- Ohh.
- And I love how your sweater

17:08.353 --> 17:11.114
cleaves tight against your breasts.

17:11.189 --> 17:13.476
- Arthur, no.
- Gross, dude.

17:13.550 --> 17:14.477
She's, like, 100.

17:14.551 --> 17:16.118
Okay, this is actually
making things worse.

17:16.194 --> 17:17.654
It's not always harassment.

17:17.729 --> 17:19.589
I mean, Jerusha and I got married.

17:19.664 --> 17:22.551
Oh, so it's not harassment
if you marry them?

17:22.627 --> 17:24.194
Oh, God, what have I done?

17:24.269 --> 17:27.664
They're like two little
robin's eggs all bundled up

17:27.739 --> 17:28.999
in a bird's nest.

17:29.074 --> 17:31.127
- Stop.
- Found her on IMDB.

17:31.202 --> 17:33.963
She was on "NCIS."
She played "Lady in Pool."

17:34.038 --> 17:35.312
Acting life is tough.

17:43.047 --> 17:47.317
So right in here is where
I saw the feces swastika.

17:47.392 --> 17:48.919
Okay.

17:50.424 --> 17:52.132
Happy Valentine's Day, baby.

17:52.218 --> 17:54.165
Mm, yeah, you too.

17:54.304 --> 17:57.648
Oh, all right, well, there you go.

17:57.751 --> 18:00.788
Oh, you didn't have to get me anything.

18:02.562 --> 18:04.820
- It's a keychain.
- Thank you.

18:04.890 --> 18:06.570
'Cause you're always losing your keys.

18:06.645 --> 18:11.333
Ahh, what a small,
thoughtful... small gift.

18:11.443 --> 18:14.036
Are you angry at me?

18:14.111 --> 18:15.111
'Cause I'm not ignoring you.

18:15.186 --> 18:16.913
I just don't think everybody
at work needs to know

18:16.988 --> 18:18.227
you're my boyfriend.

18:18.763 --> 18:19.802
Boyfriend?

18:19.827 --> 18:20.927
Yeah.

18:20.952 --> 18:22.216
I'm your boyfriend?

18:22.279 --> 18:23.307
Yeah.

18:23.398 --> 18:26.701
Oh, you've never called me that before.

18:30.282 --> 18:32.716
Boyfriend is way better
than the keychain.

18:32.815 --> 18:35.748
So what did you get me?

18:36.801 --> 18:38.789
I'm sorry. I've been dealing
with a lot of drama today.

18:38.864 --> 18:40.435
Oh, okay. Yeah, no, that's all right.

18:40.576 --> 18:41.948
- Yeah.
- Sure.

18:42.010 --> 18:43.419
Sure, so...

18:44.275 --> 18:47.303
Anyway, I was convinced that I
was gonna be the president

18:47.378 --> 18:49.581
of the thespians,
but then Steve Luber got it.

18:49.675 --> 18:51.046
- What?
- And he was in, like,

18:51.121 --> 18:51.914
three plays.

18:51.989 --> 18:53.073
Hey, sweetheart.

18:53.148 --> 18:55.850
Did you get what I sent you in
for, or did you get distracted?

18:55.925 --> 18:57.211
Men, right?

18:57.286 --> 18:58.912
Hey, wh... who...

18:58.987 --> 19:01.055
Look, Tyler and Megan are in the car.

19:01.130 --> 19:03.851
- Oh, you're married?
- No, no, no, no, no.

19:03.926 --> 19:05.259
Those are not my kids.

19:05.334 --> 19:07.895
Those are your kids with your boyfriend.

19:07.970 --> 19:09.990
How dare you!

19:10.065 --> 19:11.599
You are the closest thing
those kids have had to a father

19:11.674 --> 19:13.227
since he died at war.

19:13.302 --> 19:16.330
Fighting for the other side,
and we are not married!

19:16.419 --> 19:18.150
I never signed any divorce papers!

19:18.175 --> 19:19.261
You don't remember you signed them

19:19.286 --> 19:20.298
because of your drinking problem!

19:20.323 --> 19:21.378
I drink because of you!

19:21.478 --> 19:22.878
You don't...

19:23.178 --> 19:25.011
great, now she's gone.

19:25.089 --> 19:26.163
Why would you do that?

19:26.188 --> 19:28.831
You put your personal libido
in front of busting a thief.

19:28.906 --> 19:30.092
She's not a thief!

19:30.167 --> 19:31.675
She... oh, my God. My wallet's gone.

19:31.750 --> 19:33.494
- There you go.
- Oh, wait, no, no.

19:33.569 --> 19:34.521
It's in the other pocket.

19:34.596 --> 19:36.839
My chiropractor told me to switch it up.

19:37.042 --> 19:40.602
Jerusha, our whole marriage

19:40.900 --> 19:43.128
is based on a sex crime.

19:43.243 --> 19:47.316
No, no, no, you only think you love me.

19:47.884 --> 19:49.722
You were my victim!

19:50.254 --> 19:52.433
Ooh, he got her puppies too?

19:52.523 --> 19:55.638
I'm not a big Valentine's Day
guy, but Jeff and Sandra are...

19:55.713 --> 19:56.738
Jandra.

19:56.974 --> 19:58.730
We should call them Jandra.

20:01.078 --> 20:02.245
Puppies!

20:02.320 --> 20:03.413
Hi!

20:03.488 --> 20:06.375
Ohh!

20:06.450 --> 20:09.045
Why does everybody want to [Bleep] Jeff?

20:09.120 --> 20:12.248
Oh, hey, if you've got plans
tonight, you can head out.

20:12.323 --> 20:13.764
I'm fine to finish this up.

20:13.789 --> 20:15.433
No, I'm good.

20:15.563 --> 20:16.963
No plans for me.

20:16.988 --> 20:18.925
Yeah, me neither.

20:26.124 --> 20:27.060
Oh!

20:27.559 --> 20:30.144
Wow, you are not messing around.

20:37.755 --> 20:39.990
Aah!

20:42.092 --> 20:44.019
Yah!

20:44.094 --> 20:45.128
Aah!

20:47.264 --> 20:49.497
What is wrong with you?

20:49.661 --> 20:51.262
Ugh! Coconut.

20:51.466 --> 20:52.729
I got caramel.

20:52.849 --> 20:55.076
- Mmm.
- Mmm.

21:00.114 --> 21:02.512
Happy Valentine's Day, by the way.

21:02.587 --> 21:04.640
Oh, yeah.

21:04.817 --> 21:06.783
Happy Valentine's Day.
