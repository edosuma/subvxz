Okay, just... Just hear me out here.
We're not burying anything.

What I wanna do is buy cemetery plots
with our cash.

Then, any time we want,
we can sell it back for the same price.

11:11.204 --> 11:13.273
It's a completely liquid asset.

11:13.339 --> 11:14.907
I talked to the guys here.

11:14.946 --> 11:16.946
There's plenty of plots
available to purchase.

you're Armenian.

You know what that means?

12:18.171 --> 12:20.039
[whispers] That guy was buried alive.

12:22.508 --> 12:23.743
Come on, Mom.

12:24.978 --> 12:27.447
[moans] Hello.

12:34.153 --> 12:37.056
I know we call Dank and Dabby
fucksticks, like, a lot,

12:38.124 --> 12:39.826
but it really is the right word.

12:39.892 --> 12:43.229
Yeah, they really are
Lord and Lady Fuckstick.

12:44.088 --> 12:45.162
[cell phone buzzes]

12:45.198 --> 12:46.366
Oh, please be my mom.

12:47.333 --> 12:50.136
Ugh! It's just that same
stupid Amber Alert.

12:50.203 --> 12:55.008
Yes, silver Corolla, child abduction,
immediate danger, we get it.

12:56.509 --> 12:58.444
So, you still haven't heard
from your mom?

13:00.146 --> 13:01.381
I don't wanna talk about it.

13:03.082 --> 13:04.083
Let's talk about you.

13:05.251 --> 13:06.519
I don't wanna talk about me.

13:08.554 --> 13:10.890
Let's talk some more shit
about Dank and Dabby.

13:11.157 --> 13:12.425
Yeah.

13:12.914 --> 13:14.093
[imitating] "I'm Dabby.

13:14.190 --> 13:19.062
I smoke a shit ton of weed
and I scream for no reason!"

13:19.866 --> 13:22.869
That's her, that's her. Okay,
here we go. Here we go. Here we go.

13:22.935 --> 13:27.507
[imitating] "Dank, dick, dickhead,
douche bag, jackass,

13:27.573 --> 13:32.545
jerk off, moron, more on that later."

13:32.812 --> 13:34.480
[both whooping]

13:34.547 --> 13:37.116
"Somehow I find that attractive,
make out with me!"

13:37.183 --> 13:38.183
"Yes, I will."

13:46.592 --> 13:48.995
- They dumb.
- Yeah, so stupid.

13:50.063 --> 13:52.999
- I'm gonna get back to this trash.
- I'm gonna kick this around.

13:57.970 --> 14:00.206
[giggles] Where are we going, Daddy?

14:01.174 --> 14:02.174
A forest

14:02.442 --> 14:07.146
where you can be safe
and be with your own kind and run free.

14:07.213 --> 14:09.849
Well, stand still free.

14:11.617 --> 14:14.020
Someplace where I won't have to kill you.

14:14.487 --> 14:15.621
"Kill you?"

14:16.289 --> 14:20.059
Uh, no. No, I said "krill you."

14:21.094 --> 14:26.332
You know, make you talk to the
microscopic plankton that whales eat.

14:28.468 --> 14:29.469
Jesus.

14:30.603 --> 14:33.339
Slow down, you stupid silver Corolla.

14:35.041 --> 14:37.643
To think he'd drive like that
with his daughter in the back.

14:38.311 --> 14:40.613
Yes. Hey, hi, little girl. I see you.

14:44.984 --> 14:46.652
[melancholy music playing]

14:49.021 --> 14:53.092
[man] <i>When the tornado hit,</i>
<i>it was pretty devastating.</i>

14:53.159 --> 14:55.962
<i>Everything we had was gone.</i>

14:56.562 --> 14:58.097
[woman] <i>Even with our insurance,</i>

14:58.164 --> 15:02.068
<i>we knew it would take a while
to get life back to normal.</i>

15:02.602 --> 15:06.439
Well, we were anxious and scared.

15:07.140 --> 15:09.242
We needed to get high.

15:09.976 --> 15:11.344
[upbeat music playing]

15:12.278 --> 15:15.181
[man] <i>Within a few hours,</i>
<i>Pot Farmers was here</i>

15:15.248 --> 15:19.318
<i>with two weeks' worth
of emergency joints, lighters and bongs.</i>

15:20.219 --> 15:21.687
<i>No questions asked.</i>

15:21.954 --> 15:26.292
- And, like, good weed.
- Oh, yeah. Primo.

15:26.359 --> 15:27.994
Not that trim shit.

15:28.294 --> 15:31.164
Thank you so much. Thank you.

15:31.230 --> 15:35.401
It was really reassuring
to suddenly understand

15:35.468 --> 15:39.208
<i>that what happened to us
was an infinitesimal</i>

15:39.262 --> 15:41.583
<i>ripple in the ocean of time.</i>

15:41.674 --> 15:44.076
Plus, I got my appetite back.

15:46.712 --> 15:49.215
[both laughing]

15:55.087 --> 15:56.489
It's so funny.

15:56.556 --> 16:00.059
<i>- I don't know what the future holds.
- Nobody does.</i>

16:00.126 --> 16:07.133
But it's nice to know
we don't have to face it fully.

16:10.570 --> 16:12.038
[whispering] Where are the kids?

16:12.104 --> 16:13.439
[laughing]

16:28.588 --> 16:30.323
- What?
- Nothing.

16:35.561 --> 16:38.397
All right, what clown
put a box of turds on my desk?

16:43.202 --> 16:44.637
Those are my nana's fudge swirls.

16:44.662 --> 16:46.303
I'm trying to talk Olivia
into making them

16:46.327 --> 16:48.006
with weed so we can sell them here.

16:48.007 --> 16:50.710
Ooh. Another good idea, Travis.
You're on a roll.

16:50.776 --> 16:54.313
And "Nana's Fudge Swirls,"
what a homey name.

16:55.548 --> 16:56.616
Thank you!

16:56.682 --> 16:58.784
They wanna call them "Shitballs."

17:00.753 --> 17:02.021
Well, that's better.

17:03.523 --> 17:05.090
Stoners love a good shit joke.

17:05.558 --> 17:08.127
Okay, no, I need to make
a stand here, guys.

17:08.209 --> 17:09.949
My grandmother was the sole bright spot

17:09.973 --> 17:11.530
in an otherwise
miserable childhood, okay?

17:11.531 --> 17:14.032
We are not selling "Nana's Shitballs."

17:15.568 --> 17:17.336
How about "Olivia's Shitballs"?

17:18.704 --> 17:20.406
Can my picture be on the package?

17:21.607 --> 17:22.607
Ruth.

17:23.542 --> 17:24.609
Howdy, neighbor.

17:24.676 --> 17:27.813
How's it's Tae Kwon Do-ing?

17:39.191 --> 17:41.460
I thought we came to an understanding.

17:41.527 --> 17:43.663
Remember, we did this together?

17:44.797 --> 17:46.165
It's not what you think.

17:46.799 --> 17:50.069
I just caught your friends Tweedle Dank
and Dabby Tweedle

17:50.136 --> 17:52.538
handing out jimmies
in front of my dojang.

17:53.773 --> 17:55.575
My students could've gotten addicted.

17:55.641 --> 17:58.444
Now, hold on, "jimmies"
can mean sprinkles or condoms,

17:58.511 --> 18:00.079
depending on where you grew up.

18:00.680 --> 18:02.782
Well, I grew up in La Cañada.

18:05.451 --> 18:06.652
Just north of Glendale.

18:06.719 --> 18:08.621
It's got good people, excellent schools.

18:09.555 --> 18:13.259
Look, I'm sorry
for whatever Dank and Dabby did,

18:13.326 --> 18:15.127
but they don't work for me.

18:15.194 --> 18:16.596
Actually, Ruth, they kind of do.

18:16.662 --> 18:17.663
Zip it, dropout.

18:19.298 --> 18:20.333
I think you should know

18:20.399 --> 18:23.636
I started a petition to have your ass
thrown out of this retail plaza.

18:23.703 --> 18:26.405
And I gotta tell you,
the response has been overwhelming.

18:26.472 --> 18:27.573
What does that mean?

18:27.640 --> 18:31.344
It means that everybody I talked to
responded in one way or another.

18:32.144 --> 18:33.279
And you should be warned,

18:33.346 --> 18:34.851
because most of them requested that

18:34.876 --> 18:36.673
I come back when they were less busy.

18:37.550 --> 18:40.119
Well, I'd like to make that request
of you now.

18:42.321 --> 18:43.321
Fine.

18:44.757 --> 18:46.726
We were jerk-off buddies in the alley.

18:49.195 --> 18:50.429
And then you ruined it.

18:52.315 --> 18:55.250
Okay, again, it's not
what it sounds like.

18:55.274 --> 18:56.906
It's not. It's...

19:07.446 --> 19:08.581
[woman] Pete.

19:10.249 --> 19:14.286
[singsong] Oh, Pete.

19:15.454 --> 19:16.454
Hello?

19:18.924 --> 19:20.192
Hello, Pete.

19:22.328 --> 19:24.330
- Who are you?
- I am Mary Jane.

19:24.397 --> 19:27.166
I am the spiritual embodiment
of the marijuana plant.

19:27.233 --> 19:28.367
Oh, sure.

19:29.268 --> 19:34.440
People also call me Puff Mommy,
Lady Ganja, Green Goddess.

19:34.507 --> 19:36.342
Isn't that a salad dressing?

19:36.709 --> 19:37.709
Ow!

19:38.444 --> 19:39.879
What the hell are you doing here?

19:39.945 --> 19:42.548
I'm setting these plants free
in the forest.

19:42.615 --> 19:45.251
[scoffs] You are
an award-winning grower, Pete.

19:45.317 --> 19:47.653
You should know marijuana's
not meant to be set free!

19:47.720 --> 19:49.255
It's meant to be set on fire.

19:49.321 --> 19:53.426
To be chopped, dried, ground, rolled,
strained, pressed.

19:53.492 --> 19:56.595
Oh, I don't know, they're doing
all kinds of crazy stuff these days.

19:56.662 --> 20:00.199
You seen these "One Gram Dab" videos?
That shit is fucked.

20:01.267 --> 20:04.403
- But they're my babies.
- Then you must kill them.

20:04.470 --> 20:06.872
Like you have done
dozens of times before.

20:06.939 --> 20:08.674
But these plants are special.

20:08.741 --> 20:11.844
- They talk to me.
- No, they don't, you're just lonely.

20:11.911 --> 20:13.713
When was the last time you got laid?

20:13.779 --> 20:16.315
Ugh. Wait, I remember.

20:16.382 --> 20:18.984
It was after that Phish concert
at the Hollywood Bowl.

20:19.251 --> 20:23.255
Oh, yeah. It was stacked parking.
We weren't going anywhere, so...

20:23.322 --> 20:24.322
[Sadie yawning]

20:24.356 --> 20:27.593
- Daddy? Who are you talking to?
- No one, Sadie.

20:27.660 --> 20:28.761
No, stop it! Goddamn it!

20:28.828 --> 20:30.429
There is no Sadie!

20:30.965 --> 20:33.665
You take these golden clippers

20:33.790 --> 20:36.954
and you cut those little plants
into little pieces.

20:37.002 --> 20:38.237
No.

20:38.304 --> 20:41.006
Don't you want people
to still enjoy Phish concerts?

20:41.273 --> 20:44.276
- Yes.
- Well, this is the only way.

20:45.644 --> 20:47.546
- I can't.
- Oh, God!

20:47.613 --> 20:49.949
Do you need me to fuck some sense
into you?

20:50.649 --> 20:51.649
Okay.

20:54.520 --> 20:55.520
[sighs]

20:55.921 --> 20:57.256
You are a grower.

20:58.991 --> 21:00.459
No, Daddy! Don't!

21:00.526 --> 21:02.528
[marijuana girls chattering]

21:03.896 --> 21:04.896
I love you, Daddy!

21:04.930 --> 21:06.365
- Daddy, no!
- [Pete] Shh!

21:10.669 --> 21:12.371
Daddy, don't! No!

21:17.343 --> 21:19.845
Hi, I'm Olivia
from Ruth's Alternative Caring.

21:19.912 --> 21:21.881
- And this is my friend Maria.
- Friend?

21:22.047 --> 21:23.616
Aw. [chuckles]

21:25.518 --> 21:28.320
Who has a double-oven
and a big-ass stand mixer, so...

21:28.821 --> 21:31.056
And a housekeeper
that showed us how to use them.

21:31.323 --> 21:33.859
Shout out to Rosita.
Pathway to citizenship.

21:36.295 --> 21:39.665
Now, for the first time ever,
our Strain O' the Day is an edible.

21:39.965 --> 21:43.035
- And it's called...
- Olivia's Shitballs.

21:43.302 --> 21:44.403
[laughs]

21:45.938 --> 21:47.473
- [Maria] They look like poop.
- Yes.

21:50.342 --> 21:53.412
Okay, baked
from my beloved grandmother's recipe,

21:53.479 --> 21:57.683
these mouth-watering treats
have been the hit of countless potlucks,

21:57.750 --> 21:59.685
church suppers, VFW bake sales...

21:59.752 --> 22:02.454
But now they're filled
with marijuana grass.

22:03.722 --> 22:05.591
You guys know how it works with edibles.

22:05.658 --> 22:07.860
The dosage can be tricky
so start with just one.

22:07.927 --> 22:10.796
Right. Right, right.
Because once you get to number two,

22:14.066 --> 22:15.534
things can get messy.

22:15.601 --> 22:17.036
[laughs]

22:18.070 --> 22:19.505
- Do you get it?
- Okay, stop.

22:20.506 --> 22:21.506
Let's just try one.

22:24.810 --> 22:26.879
Oh, my God. That is some good shit.

22:29.381 --> 22:31.517
Think about all the fun
you can have with them.

22:31.584 --> 22:32.851
Put one on your boss's chair.

22:32.918 --> 22:34.954
Take one to the zoo
and throw it at a monkey.

22:35.020 --> 22:38.057
Or, for that perfect baby shower
party favor...

22:39.558 --> 22:41.393
Aww!

22:42.394 --> 22:43.394
Itty-bitty baby.

22:43.429 --> 22:47.433
Anyway, [laughs] what used to be
a precious childhood memory

22:47.499 --> 22:49.902
is now available for ten bucks
for a pack of three.

22:49.969 --> 22:52.438
And that's a full movement.

22:55.908 --> 22:56.909
Did you get that one?

22:58.811 --> 23:01.580
- It's a bowel movement,
- Bowel. Yeah, I got it.

23:11.690 --> 23:13.692
- Hey.
- Hey.

23:14.994 --> 23:15.994
So, um...

23:16.862 --> 23:19.031
I haven't done this in a while, but...

23:20.899 --> 23:22.134
would you wanna have dinner?

23:23.168 --> 23:25.037
You haven't had dinner in a while?

23:28.040 --> 23:29.408
Please don't fuck with me.

23:31.110 --> 23:32.111
This is hard enough.

23:33.412 --> 23:34.412
I'm sorry.

23:34.847 --> 23:37.082
Yes, I would love to have
dinner with you, Carter.

23:38.784 --> 23:39.784
Cool.

23:47.450 --> 23:49.051
You know, I'm really not high at all.

23:49.075 --> 23:50.795
Are you sure we put enough weed in?

23:50.796 --> 23:53.499
Really? Because I'm feeling it all over.

23:53.565 --> 23:55.834
Then again, I'm much smaller than you.

23:57.836 --> 24:00.172
No, no, no. It's just that, um...

24:00.806 --> 24:04.543
I'm petite and you're athletic.

24:05.644 --> 24:06.644
Have another one.

24:09.682 --> 24:11.784
- Hey, Pete.
- What's up?

24:11.850 --> 24:13.519
I harvested the weed.

24:13.585 --> 24:15.621
- Oh, yeah. Cool.
- Yeah, it was.

24:15.688 --> 24:17.056
You know what else was cool?

24:17.122 --> 24:20.159
Mary Jane,
the spiritual embodiment of marijuana,

24:20.225 --> 24:22.127
fucked me sideways last night.

24:23.662 --> 24:25.230
I thought we were making love.

24:26.765 --> 24:27.900
Yeah, of course we were.

24:28.834 --> 24:30.636
You used the F-word.

24:30.703 --> 24:32.171
I'm sorry.

24:32.237 --> 24:35.674
Yeah, this was not just, like,
a one-night thing for me.

24:35.741 --> 24:37.576
No, I know. Me neither.

24:38.010 --> 24:41.847
I'm s... I don't...
Yeah, I... Yeah, sure. Yeah.

24:45.084 --> 24:46.685
There's no one there, right?

24:48.821 --> 24:51.123
No, but he does make a cute couple.

24:52.624 --> 24:54.693
Could I have everybody's attention?

24:55.194 --> 24:57.029
Sorry, baby, I gotta work.

24:59.198 --> 25:02.101
Three months ago my son, Travis,
came back from business school

25:02.167 --> 25:03.736
to help me run this place.

25:04.136 --> 25:10.209
And at the time, I was skeptical
and stubborn and, um, a little hungry.

25:10.275 --> 25:11.510
Olivia, Shitball me.

25:17.049 --> 25:18.984
Oh, fucking A, Olivia.

25:20.686 --> 25:21.686
Mm.

25:21.711 --> 25:22.755
Where was I?

25:22.821 --> 25:23.822
- Skeptical.
- Stubborn.

25:23.889 --> 25:25.524
- A little shrill.
- Pain in the ass.

25:25.591 --> 25:26.859
California.

25:29.261 --> 25:30.562
[Ruth] All right, all right.

25:30.629 --> 25:35.033
Since then, I've come to realize
that Travis knows what he's doing.

25:35.901 --> 25:39.304
And that's made me think
of all the things I haven't done

25:39.571 --> 25:41.106
and I haven't had the time to do,

25:41.173 --> 25:45.177
because I've been so focused
on running this business.

25:46.612 --> 25:51.016
So, this morning
I remembered I'm a lawyer.

25:53.752 --> 25:58.257
And I filed the paperwork
for change of ownership.

25:58.991 --> 26:01.727
So as of now, Travis and I
are equal partners.

26:02.694 --> 26:08.233
And Ruth's Alternative Caring is now
Ruth's Travis Alternative Caring.

26:08.300 --> 26:10.936
- Oh, yay!
- All right. Cool.

26:12.237 --> 26:14.072
Wow, Mom, thank you.

26:14.255 --> 26:15.307
Baby.

26:15.574 --> 26:16.575
[Carter] Nice.

26:16.642 --> 26:19.211
- Speech.
- Say something.

26:20.112 --> 26:22.214
[stammering] I don't believe this.

26:22.714 --> 26:24.650
I mean, this is really exciting.
You know?

26:24.716 --> 26:26.919
All of us working together
to make this store...

26:26.985 --> 26:27.985
- DEA!
- DEA!

26:28.020 --> 26:30.055
This is a raid. Everybody on the ground.

26:30.080 --> 26:31.098
Faces down!

26:31.123 --> 26:32.224
- Right now!
- Get down!

26:32.249 --> 26:33.377
Get on the ground!

26:33.416 --> 26:34.860
- Get down.
- Down!
