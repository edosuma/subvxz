00:02.253 --> 00:04.381
<i>Previously on Marvel's</i>
Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D...

00:04.464 --> 00:06.383
Why do you want
to rebuild the portal, Jemma?

00:06.549 --> 00:08.218
<i>Because I have to
get back there.</i>

00:08.760 --> 00:10.053
We're going to get him back.

00:10.136 --> 00:11.221
<i>I saw something.</i>

00:11.304 --> 00:13.014
<i>Lash can turn into a person.</i>

00:13.098 --> 00:15.016
I mean, think about it,
he could be anybody.

00:15.100 --> 00:16.935
I know you really want to
get back into action, Agent Morse,

00:17.060 --> 00:18.061
but the answer's no.

00:18.144 --> 00:19.229
Understood, sir.

00:19.312 --> 00:21.106
If I don't call off my men,

00:21.231 --> 00:23.149
<i>Dr Andrew Garner is a dead man.</i>

00:23.274 --> 00:25.443
All you have to do
is put your weapons down,

00:25.568 --> 00:26.653
and I'll let you go.

00:26.778 --> 00:28.238
I'm sorry.

01:03.481 --> 01:04.941
Agent May.

01:06.651 --> 01:07.986
He's alive.

01:17.495 --> 01:19.581
Possible pneumo on the right.
Let's get him on the monitor.

01:19.664 --> 01:22.125
He's dry. I'm starting him
on another litre of fluid.

01:22.208 --> 01:23.585
Andrew.

01:24.002 --> 01:25.044
What happened?

01:26.212 --> 01:27.756
I went to the store.

01:28.548 --> 01:30.717
I had a headache, I needed something.

01:30.842 --> 01:32.761
One of my students was there. He's a...

01:32.844 --> 01:35.847
Hey, Professor. Where you been?

01:35.930 --> 01:38.099
...transfer student,
he only started a few weeks ago.

01:38.183 --> 01:39.934
<i>Had two men with him.</i>

01:40.685 --> 01:43.521
<i>My experience is limited,
but I'd say they were professionals.</i>

01:44.397 --> 01:46.024
It was HYDRA.

01:49.068 --> 01:50.695
<i>I don't know
why they'd be after me.</i>

01:50.862 --> 01:54.115
- I do.
- May, this isn't your fault.

01:56.618 --> 01:57.869
How'd you survive?

01:58.453 --> 01:59.579
Phil.

02:03.124 --> 02:05.043
He had a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent tailing me.

02:05.126 --> 02:06.795
<i>The man saved my life.</i>

02:08.045 --> 02:11.007
He gave me time to find cover
and must have caught Alex off-guard,

02:11.090 --> 02:13.384
because nothing went
exactly as planned.

02:16.596 --> 02:17.722
<i>The kid had a lighter.</i>

02:24.604 --> 02:26.940
I barely made it to the door.

02:27.065 --> 02:29.734
And the blast must've thrown me clear.

02:30.568 --> 02:33.655
Next thing I remember,
you were there, picking me up.

02:35.573 --> 02:38.576
I'm lucky. Can't see how anyone
would've survived that.

02:38.993 --> 02:43.081
Now, I know Alex is troubled,
but I'm not sorry he's gone.

02:43.748 --> 02:45.583
Ward would've made him finish the job.

02:48.920 --> 02:50.839
- What if Ward...
- He won't.

02:50.922 --> 02:52.799
You're safe now, we got you.

02:53.675 --> 02:56.594
We'll let the doctor work on you.
You need to get some rest.

02:58.096 --> 02:59.305
Where the hell do you think
you're going?

02:59.430 --> 03:01.432
- I think I'm going to see Andrew.
- No.

03:01.516 --> 03:03.226
I just wanna make sure he's all right.

03:03.309 --> 03:04.352
You're the reason he's not.

03:04.435 --> 03:06.354
Ward was gonna hurt him no matter...

03:07.939 --> 03:09.774
- I made the most logical choice.
- Yeah, logical?

03:09.858 --> 03:10.942
You wanted revenge.

03:11.025 --> 03:12.777
Hey, hey, hey!

03:14.612 --> 03:17.240
Coulson's orders were to end him.
I had one shot, I took it.

03:17.323 --> 03:19.325
And you missed.
You're off that assignment.

03:21.661 --> 03:23.955
Good. Then put me on it.

03:25.790 --> 03:27.125
Let me go after him.

03:27.667 --> 03:28.793
Are you back?

03:30.628 --> 03:32.171
Yeah, I'm back.

03:41.389 --> 03:44.767
S.H.I.E.L.D. sent a man
to assassinate me.

03:44.851 --> 03:47.812
He came into my house
and tried to kill me.

03:48.313 --> 03:50.648
Because you let him in.
You were sloppy.

03:50.732 --> 03:51.983
I followed your protocol.

03:52.483 --> 03:54.068
He killed a man to get close to you.

03:54.152 --> 03:56.237
He wanted you dead that much.

03:56.321 --> 03:58.656
They all want me dead that much.

04:00.491 --> 04:02.911
- Now we have a dangling thread.
- Von Strucker.

04:02.994 --> 04:05.204
You shouldn't have sent a boy
to do a man's job.

04:05.330 --> 04:06.789
Not really sure you would've blended in

04:06.873 --> 04:08.374
as an undergrad
watching Garner.

04:10.835 --> 04:12.337
Has Von Strucker called in?

04:14.255 --> 04:18.927
So, he's either captured, killed,
or he's running.

04:19.010 --> 04:20.887
And only one of those options
works for us.

04:21.012 --> 04:22.430
The kid knows too much.

04:22.513 --> 04:24.682
So go and find him
before S.H.I.E.L.D. does.

04:25.600 --> 04:26.851
If he's still alive,

04:27.685 --> 04:28.770
take care of him.

04:35.234 --> 04:37.111
Hey. How are you holding up?

04:37.195 --> 04:39.072
I'm pissed. I got manhandled by Lash

04:39.197 --> 04:41.783
and I messed up our chance
to see the ATCU facility.

04:42.367 --> 04:45.036
But, good news, I have a theory.

04:45.119 --> 04:46.496
I like theories.

04:46.579 --> 04:48.206
Lash was tracking us.

04:48.289 --> 04:51.334
He knew where our truck was.
He needed inside info for that.

04:51.417 --> 04:53.711
You think he's got access
to ATCU information?

04:54.379 --> 04:55.838
No, I...

04:55.922 --> 04:57.715
I think he's in the ATCU.

04:59.092 --> 05:02.679
We know that he can transform himself
into a regular size guy and back.

05:02.762 --> 05:04.806
What if he's hiding out as one of them?

05:04.889 --> 05:06.599
That's a scary thought.

05:07.100 --> 05:09.477
I've got Rosalind giving me a tour
of her operation today.

05:09.560 --> 05:10.812
Let me see what I find there.

05:10.895 --> 05:13.314
Good. I'll see what I can get
on Lash's identity.

05:13.398 --> 05:16.025
And whatever you dig into,
try to keep it off Rosalind's radar.

05:16.109 --> 05:17.735
I need her to trust me today.

05:18.653 --> 05:20.780
You're not having a hard time
working her, are you?

05:21.614 --> 05:24.158
Not getting too attached?

05:25.410 --> 05:28.871
You do this long enough, you learn
to cut yourself off from all that.

05:28.955 --> 05:30.748
Makes it easier to do the job.

05:31.916 --> 05:33.084
Sir.

05:34.919 --> 05:36.587
Is May really back for good?

05:36.671 --> 05:39.340
I'm not sure.
Right now she's out for blood.

05:42.927 --> 05:44.095
May.

05:44.929 --> 05:47.598
I heard about Andrew. How's he... Hey!

05:47.765 --> 05:50.268
- What the hell?
- Hunter nearly cost Andrew his life.

05:50.351 --> 05:51.561
And he was doing it for you.

05:51.644 --> 05:53.730
- I feel terrible.
- You were egging him on.

05:53.813 --> 05:55.940
Letting him fight your battles for you.
It's your fault.

05:56.024 --> 05:57.775
If I knew Andrew was in danger,
I never...

05:57.859 --> 05:59.944
Oh!

06:00.153 --> 06:01.529
Okay, you're upset.

06:20.840 --> 06:22.467
So you can fight your own battles.

06:23.676 --> 06:24.802
What?

06:27.055 --> 06:28.431
You were testing me?

06:28.514 --> 06:30.391
Had to make sure
you were mission-ready.

06:36.981 --> 06:38.941
Coulson still has me off combat duty.

06:39.025 --> 06:40.943
And tests say that
my lung hasn't healed all the way yet.

06:41.027 --> 06:42.528
My test says otherwise.

06:43.529 --> 06:45.198
Wheels up in 20.

06:45.323 --> 06:47.033
Welcome back, Agent Morse.

07:00.838 --> 07:02.882
- Bob.
- Not your mission, Hunter.

07:03.007 --> 07:05.384
Stay away, or I'll make you stay away.

07:05.510 --> 07:07.095
I just want a minute with my ex-wife.

07:12.683 --> 07:14.602
- I'm going with you.
- Like hell you are.

07:15.186 --> 07:17.230
- You put Andrew at risk.
- I had Ward in my sights.

07:17.355 --> 07:18.981
Damn right I pulled the trigger.

07:19.065 --> 07:21.734
- You of all people should get it.
- I get it.

07:21.859 --> 07:23.986
You were quick to violence
and an innocent got hurt.

07:24.070 --> 07:26.823
Other people aren't as used to
your behaviour as I am.

07:26.906 --> 07:29.033
Since when do you care
what other people think?

07:32.370 --> 07:35.039
You're really going back in the field,
after him.

07:35.748 --> 07:36.916
I'm ready.

07:37.625 --> 07:38.751
You're lying?

07:39.794 --> 07:40.920
No.

07:42.880 --> 07:44.048
Do better than I did, yeah?

07:46.134 --> 07:47.426
You're not gonna say the thing?

07:48.261 --> 07:49.595
You already know.

08:08.239 --> 08:10.491
Andrew didn't get all the details
exactly right.

08:10.575 --> 08:12.660
He said there were
four men on the scene,

08:12.743 --> 08:14.620
but only three bodies were recovered.

08:14.745 --> 08:16.455
Coulson's man, two HYDRA guys.

08:16.581 --> 08:18.499
The fourth guy
was one of Andrew's students.

08:18.583 --> 08:21.085
That's his ID, but it's an alias.

08:21.169 --> 08:22.712
He's not Alexander Braun.

08:22.795 --> 08:24.380
He's Werner Von Strucker.

08:24.463 --> 08:27.008
- Wait, Von Strucker? As in...
- Hail, HYDRA.

08:28.092 --> 08:30.845
Ward was starting his own
little HYDRA dynasty. Cute.

08:30.928 --> 08:33.597
We find the Strucker kid,
he'll lead us back to Ward.

08:33.681 --> 08:34.724
You got a how?

08:34.807 --> 08:38.144
S.H.I.E.L.D.'s been monitoring several
HYDRA bank accounts for a while now.

08:38.227 --> 08:39.352
One just woke up.

08:41.230 --> 08:42.440
Cayman Islands.

08:42.523 --> 08:44.483
Strucker needed funds. Makes sense.

08:44.567 --> 08:45.735
So what's the op?

08:46.861 --> 08:47.904
How's your Mandarin?

08:49.822 --> 08:52.909
If we head down there,
maybe we'll pick up his trail.

08:52.992 --> 08:55.494
He's on the run from Ward, from us.

08:56.204 --> 08:58.080
Almost makes me feel sorry for the kid.

08:58.831 --> 09:00.166
He's a monster.

09:00.249 --> 09:01.584
You were right
to ask me to come.

09:01.876 --> 09:03.211
I didn't know where else to turn.

09:03.294 --> 09:06.172
I figured you and my father must've
dealt with guys like Ward all the time.

09:06.797 --> 09:08.090
Ward is...

09:09.175 --> 09:10.760
I didn't finish the mission.

09:11.302 --> 09:12.428
He won't care why.

09:12.511 --> 09:16.140
If you put an untested youth in play
without proper training, it's foolish.

09:16.224 --> 09:17.433
Boggles the mind, really.

09:18.059 --> 09:19.518
Your father understood.

09:19.602 --> 09:23.439
Protecting assets is more important
that flaunting them.

09:23.814 --> 09:25.066
He never let me in on that stuff.

09:26.776 --> 09:28.069
You were nicer to me than he was.

09:28.819 --> 09:30.613
Your father was a great man.

09:31.072 --> 09:32.406
Trust me,

09:32.949 --> 09:34.867
we would have never
put up with such things.

09:34.951 --> 09:38.120
You don't know this guy Ward.
He's scary.

09:39.080 --> 09:40.748
I'm aware of Grant Ward.

09:40.998 --> 09:45.503
He was once an untested youth, too.
Everyone has a history.

09:47.046 --> 09:48.673
So does that mean you'll help me?

09:50.633 --> 09:52.301
I'll handle everything.

09:56.764 --> 09:58.391
Nice of you to pick me up.

09:58.474 --> 09:59.600
Yes, on the corner.

09:59.684 --> 10:01.936
Since you won't tell me
where your base is.

10:02.019 --> 10:03.604
You know I run
a spy organisation, right?

10:03.688 --> 10:04.897
And you know we agreed

10:04.981 --> 10:06.899
to share information, right?

10:09.318 --> 10:10.361
Yeah.

10:11.279 --> 10:13.197
When? Do you know who?

10:15.116 --> 10:18.202
All right. Just have them
get started, I'm on my way.

10:19.453 --> 10:20.496
Turn around.

10:20.579 --> 10:22.373
- We need to head back.
- Yes, ma'am.

10:23.040 --> 10:27.044
I'm sorry, it's an emergency
I need to handle. We'll reschedule.

10:35.928 --> 10:38.597
So, this is the part
where you get out of the car.

10:39.181 --> 10:40.308
I don't think so.

10:40.391 --> 10:41.934
Do you not get how this works?

10:42.018 --> 10:44.061
What I get is that
it's time to see this facility.

10:44.145 --> 10:45.938
No more delays.

10:46.022 --> 10:47.106
I'll stay with you.

10:47.189 --> 10:48.524
When the emergency is done,
then we can go.

10:48.607 --> 10:50.443
You can't. Not where I'm going.

10:50.526 --> 10:52.278
Oh, so we're not sharing
information then?

10:52.361 --> 10:54.613
'Cause you kind of just
made a whole thing about that.

10:56.282 --> 10:57.366
Okay.

10:58.451 --> 11:00.202
Director Coulson will be joining us.

11:01.078 --> 11:02.121
Take me home.

11:10.546 --> 11:11.881
<i>I just thought
you could use some help.</i>

11:11.964 --> 11:14.175
I've got it, I promise.
I just need to concentrate.

11:15.634 --> 11:18.429
Really? 'Cause it looks like
your mind is kind of elsewhere.

11:19.680 --> 11:21.849
The portal simulation is just
running in the background.

11:21.932 --> 11:23.309
They're not taking any of my time.

11:23.392 --> 11:25.353
Doesn't make it a good idea.

11:27.605 --> 11:29.774
What, you don't think
I should help Simmons rescue Will?

11:29.857 --> 11:31.067
Do you think you should?

11:31.150 --> 11:32.443
He's the competition.

11:32.526 --> 11:34.153
If your girlfriend's ex
wants to visit from Phoenix,

11:34.236 --> 11:35.905
you do not buy him a plane ticket.

11:36.947 --> 11:38.199
That's really specific.

11:38.324 --> 11:39.367
Hmm?

11:39.700 --> 11:42.328
Anyway, this guy kept Simmons alive.

11:42.411 --> 11:44.205
I owe him, he deserves my help.

11:44.830 --> 11:48.417
Just because he kept Simmons warm
for a few months with fire,

11:49.001 --> 11:50.836
doesn't mean he's someone
you should save.

11:50.920 --> 11:52.338
How much do you
even know about him?

11:52.421 --> 11:54.882
What are you doing in here?

11:54.965 --> 11:56.050
I mean, why are you here?

12:00.137 --> 12:01.555
Coulson put me on the bench.

12:03.182 --> 12:05.476
So I thought I would offer
my expertise elsewhere.

12:07.561 --> 12:09.730
Is that what you're going with,
Katelin Frayer?

12:10.648 --> 12:13.109
Is that how you spell "Katelin"? K-A-T?

12:13.192 --> 12:14.693
I'm not sure that's right, mate.

12:14.777 --> 12:16.987
Yeah. No.
There's lots of ways to spell Katelin.

12:17.071 --> 12:18.989
And can you please
just find somewhere else

12:19.073 --> 12:20.282
to make yourself useful?

12:22.034 --> 12:23.119
Copy that.

12:29.458 --> 12:32.753
Dr Garner, it's good to see you up.
Do you have time for a consult?

12:32.837 --> 12:34.422
Oh, God, yes, please.

12:35.589 --> 12:38.175
Ah, that came out more desperate
than I intended.

12:38.259 --> 12:40.177
Being laid up is very boring.

12:40.636 --> 12:42.555
- What's up?
- It's Lash.

12:43.389 --> 12:45.641
- Lash?
- The Inhuman killer-monster.

12:45.724 --> 12:47.476
Oh, right.
I heard you had a run-in with him.

12:47.560 --> 12:48.894
I'm glad you're okay.

12:48.978 --> 12:50.479
That is what I don't understand.

12:50.563 --> 12:52.273
Why am I okay?

12:52.356 --> 12:55.818
He kills Inhumans, he killed Frye.
Why spare me?

12:56.068 --> 12:57.361
It's a tough one.

12:57.445 --> 13:00.030
I'm still trying to put together
an Inhuman psych profile on him.

13:01.198 --> 13:02.366
They're all different.

13:02.450 --> 13:04.952
Yeah, but he's really different.

13:08.497 --> 13:10.458
He changed into a guy.

13:10.541 --> 13:11.792
A regular guy.

13:11.876 --> 13:13.002
You saw him?

13:13.085 --> 13:15.588
- Did you get a good look at him?
- No, just his shadow, but still.

13:16.797 --> 13:18.090
I didn't know that was possible.

13:18.174 --> 13:22.720
Me neither, but someone that big
and ugly, I mean, it makes sense.

13:22.803 --> 13:24.680
He's got to get around
without being noticed somehow.

13:24.763 --> 13:26.974
Or maybe Lincoln can help.
You know where he is?

13:27.057 --> 13:30.186
No idea. He's been off the grid
since the ATCU tried picking him up,

13:30.269 --> 13:31.312
but he calls sometimes...

13:31.395 --> 13:33.939
Hey, Tremors. You got a sec?

13:34.023 --> 13:35.608
Yeah. Um...

13:36.859 --> 13:38.819
Thank you. I'll keep you posted.

13:40.237 --> 13:41.280
What's up?

13:42.198 --> 13:44.116
I've been thinking about
your ATCU theory.

13:44.200 --> 13:45.951
Now who took off before the convoy left

13:46.035 --> 13:48.287
and who knew the exact route
we were going to take?

13:50.498 --> 13:51.582
Banks.

13:51.665 --> 13:54.668
He's got access to everything
the ATCU learns about Inhumans.

13:56.587 --> 13:57.630
We should tail him.

13:57.713 --> 14:00.799
Already got a van ready to go.
Full surveillance package.

14:00.883 --> 14:03.135
Infrared scanners, one-way glass.

14:03.219 --> 14:04.553
Perfect. Let me get some things.

14:04.637 --> 14:05.679
I'll drive.

14:07.014 --> 14:09.433
I mean, please.

14:17.274 --> 14:20.027
Miss Wong would like to access
her safe deposit box.

14:20.110 --> 14:21.695
Here's her account number.

14:21.779 --> 14:23.405
I will need your IDs, please.

14:23.489 --> 14:24.698
Of course.

14:38.712 --> 14:39.797
Miss Wong likes your tie.

14:50.849 --> 14:52.101
Follow me.

15:03.070 --> 15:04.863
Take as much time as you need.

15:28.178 --> 15:29.722
Box 38.

15:36.478 --> 15:39.857
Fitz, we need anything on Strucker,
anything that will get us to Ward.

15:39.940 --> 15:41.483
Yeah, getting it.

15:41.567 --> 15:44.862
Real estate deeds, passport. No cash?

15:44.945 --> 15:46.238
<i>He must have cleared it all out.</i>

15:46.697 --> 15:48.324
<i>He probably
doesn't want it found.</i>

15:48.532 --> 15:50.618
Oh, uh, guys, I think you triggered
an alarm somewhere.

15:51.952 --> 15:53.787
- Great.
- How much time do we have?

15:53.912 --> 15:55.789
Uh, oh!

15:56.665 --> 15:57.791
Looks like zero.

16:13.682 --> 16:14.975
What is happening in here?

16:19.897 --> 16:22.066
- My boss would like to congratulate you.
- What?

16:23.609 --> 16:27.237
Your security system is top-notch
and your team is incredibly efficient.

16:28.447 --> 16:30.449
Just what we had hoped for.

16:32.534 --> 16:34.036
We've been reading up on you.

16:34.536 --> 16:36.121
I see where you're going with this.
One second.

16:36.580 --> 16:38.082
<i>And we'd like to offer you a job.</i>

16:38.499 --> 16:39.958
A job?

16:40.542 --> 16:43.212
This seems most unorthodox.

16:43.295 --> 16:45.297
We were sent
from your former employer,

16:45.381 --> 16:46.757
First Fiduciary National.

16:46.840 --> 16:48.092
<i>And they would like you back.</i>

16:48.175 --> 16:51.011
I know it's been hard,
your wife missing Miami.

16:51.095 --> 16:52.179
How long have you been separated?

16:52.805 --> 16:53.931
You know about that?

16:56.433 --> 16:58.936
You're only earning 4% more
than you were in 2012.

16:59.103 --> 17:00.396
We can do better.

17:02.231 --> 17:04.942
I... I have been looking
to make a change.

17:22.751 --> 17:24.211
Sorry.

17:31.635 --> 17:33.387
No one yet.

17:34.513 --> 17:35.848
Banks is still not back.

17:36.890 --> 17:40.853
He wasn't back 37 seconds ago either,
but thanks for the regular updates.

17:40.936 --> 17:44.022
This guy is bad news.
Got discharged from the Marines.

17:44.106 --> 17:46.442
- With cause.
- And Rosalind hired him anyway.

17:46.525 --> 17:49.570
He was part of an elite anti-alien
taskforce after New York.

17:49.653 --> 17:50.779
Of course he was.

17:50.863 --> 17:52.865
So what's the plan when he gets back?

17:52.948 --> 17:55.242
Is this a grab and torture kind of deal?

17:55.868 --> 17:58.495
Choke hold might not work
if he turns out to be Lash.

17:58.579 --> 18:00.456
- But we could...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

18:00.539 --> 18:02.499
Slow down, Gitmo.
I thought you just wanted to drive.

18:02.583 --> 18:04.793
Just offering helpful suggestions.

18:04.877 --> 18:06.670
Helpful in what way exactly?

18:06.754 --> 18:08.756
Um, stopping bad guys.

18:08.839 --> 18:09.965
How about professionalism?

18:10.048 --> 18:12.426
Doing the job smart?
Not getting people killed?

18:12.509 --> 18:13.635
Hmm.

18:13.719 --> 18:15.846
Wild guess,
this isn't about following Banks.

18:15.929 --> 18:17.848
Hunter, come on. Andrew almost died.

18:18.307 --> 18:19.475
And there we have it.

18:19.558 --> 18:21.977
Look, it's not like I just
handed over Andrew and said,

18:22.060 --> 18:23.437
"Hey, please kill our friend."

18:23.520 --> 18:25.939
- Right. "I had no choice."
- I had no choice.

18:26.023 --> 18:27.441
Guys. Guys.

18:34.656 --> 18:36.325
Looks like we're following him home.

18:36.784 --> 18:38.368
At a safe distance.

18:52.716 --> 18:54.635
Rosalind Price, ATCU.

18:54.718 --> 18:56.762
Yes, ma'am.
Sorry about the circumstances.

18:56.845 --> 18:59.223
We'll do our best to make sure
we find whoever broke in here.

18:59.807 --> 19:01.433
Someone broke into your home?

19:01.517 --> 19:02.893
- Any leads?
- Not yet.

19:02.976 --> 19:07.064
Looks like the guy was scared away by
your very impressive security system.

19:08.023 --> 19:09.191
All right if we take a look around?

19:09.775 --> 19:10.901
Of course.

19:11.610 --> 19:12.986
Not you.

19:14.822 --> 19:15.864
This way.

19:19.535 --> 19:20.869
Nice place, huh?

19:22.287 --> 19:24.206
You can tell a lot about a woman
from her books.

19:27.417 --> 19:29.503
Okay, I didn't actually know that

19:29.586 --> 19:32.089
there were this many
biographies of Margaret Thatcher.

19:36.176 --> 19:37.511
New furniture.

19:39.930 --> 19:41.181
Brand new.

19:48.355 --> 19:49.606
Holy...

19:50.190 --> 19:52.484
- Where did you get...
- Don't touch my things.

19:53.569 --> 19:56.280
Sorry. Anything missing?

19:56.363 --> 19:58.615
Then you weren't listening in
when I talked to the cop?

19:59.116 --> 20:03.161
You're slipping, Phil. I thought
you'd definitely be scoping things out.

20:23.473 --> 20:25.517
He's gonna go back inside
when he finishes his call.

20:25.601 --> 20:26.852
What's our next move?

20:26.935 --> 20:28.687
He goes in his house,
we're done for the day.

20:28.770 --> 20:30.480
I don't wanna give up on him yet.

20:30.564 --> 20:34.192
Or I could break into his car and drop
a spot cam in his speedometer.

20:34.276 --> 20:36.528
We have to be stealthy.
If he catches you, we're toast.

20:36.612 --> 20:37.738
Coulson is in the belly of the beast.

20:37.821 --> 20:39.990
We can't tip off the ATCU
that we're on to them.

20:40.073 --> 20:41.825
There must be some way we can keep...

20:43.619 --> 20:44.786
What...

20:45.579 --> 20:47.372
Oh, no.

20:49.917 --> 20:50.959
What's happening?

20:52.377 --> 20:53.545
Hey!

20:54.421 --> 20:55.672
- Oh!
- Come on!

21:00.928 --> 21:02.387
So much for stealthy.

21:08.602 --> 21:11.813
- Here we go.
- And this is a good idea how?

21:11.897 --> 21:13.649
I didn't kill him, I just ICE'd him.

21:13.732 --> 21:15.067
And screwed Coulson.

21:15.150 --> 21:18.111
He's working Rosalind
and you just shot her number two.

21:18.195 --> 21:19.279
- When she finds out...
- She won't.

21:19.363 --> 21:20.739
That's what the bandana's for.

21:21.114 --> 21:23.992
Lash is an Inhuman,
Inhumans have markers in their DNA.

21:24.076 --> 21:28.038
If we test Banks' blood for markers,
we'll know if he's Inhuman or not.

21:34.294 --> 21:35.754
That's actually kind of smart.

21:36.129 --> 21:37.172
Thank you.

21:37.339 --> 21:39.466
But I still think you need to talk about
your anger issues.

21:39.549 --> 21:40.592
And this isn't the med lab.

21:40.676 --> 21:42.678
We don't have the equipment
to draw Banks' blood.

21:44.179 --> 21:45.931
Okay.

21:46.014 --> 21:47.140
There you go. Blood.

21:48.642 --> 21:51.353
Okay, there might be
a small anger issue.

21:51.853 --> 21:53.313
Just pass me the swab.

21:54.523 --> 21:55.565
Argh.

21:57.567 --> 22:00.153
All I'm saying is that you've been
through something extreme.

22:00.862 --> 22:02.406
There will be after effects.

22:03.281 --> 22:04.700
Sound familiar?

22:07.411 --> 22:09.413
It's eye-opening being
on this side of the counselling.

22:09.997 --> 22:11.915
People treat you with kid gloves.

22:12.457 --> 22:14.209
They mean well,
but the more they try to help...

22:14.292 --> 22:15.961
The weaker you feel.

22:17.004 --> 22:18.588
Maybe it's our PhDs.

22:20.215 --> 22:23.010
Makes them underestimate
just how strong we really are.

22:23.677 --> 22:24.761
Might just be.

22:25.512 --> 22:26.722
Excuse me.

22:27.931 --> 22:29.016
- Daisy.
<i>- Jemma.</i>

22:29.099 --> 22:32.477
I know you haven't been in the lab and
I hate to ask you to do work, but if...

22:32.561 --> 22:34.896
In fact, I can handle it actually.

22:34.980 --> 22:36.064
Whatever it is.

22:37.482 --> 22:39.109
Do you have time to run
a blood analysis?

22:39.192 --> 22:40.944
I want to see if Banks
has Inhuman markers.

22:41.528 --> 22:43.071
I have plenty of time. Send away.

22:45.615 --> 22:46.908
Thank you, Jemma.

22:46.992 --> 22:48.702
<i>- I'll call when I know.</i>
- Okay.

22:50.537 --> 22:52.706
- Anything?
- Guy shops at Costco.

22:52.789 --> 22:54.041
Anything useful?

22:54.124 --> 22:57.711
There's not even any selfies.
Banks, you are boring.

22:57.794 --> 23:00.464
Well, apart from the fact that
he might be a giant beast

23:00.589 --> 23:03.050
who blows holes
in people's chests, but...

23:03.550 --> 23:05.635
I didn't do it. It wasn't me.

23:06.720 --> 23:07.971
We know.

23:08.638 --> 23:09.639
It's a phone.

23:11.600 --> 23:14.061
"Subject en route to Endotex."
No caller ID.

23:14.144 --> 23:17.230
Something called Endotex Labs
in Gaithersburg.

23:17.314 --> 23:18.398
We could check it out.
What do you think?

23:18.482 --> 23:20.984
Well, we got time before Simmons
comes back with results.

23:21.109 --> 23:22.903
- What about him?
- We could take him with us.

23:22.986 --> 23:25.572
I've been trapped in a moving vehicle
with Lash before.

23:25.655 --> 23:27.657
I don't love the idea
of it happening again.

23:28.325 --> 23:32.162
Yes, if he has the DNA markers,
we know where to find him. Let's go.

23:43.173 --> 23:44.591
Cops finished up.

23:44.674 --> 23:46.343
I had my driver pick up
some burgers for us,

23:46.468 --> 23:48.929
figured you could use some dinner.

23:49.012 --> 23:51.014
D.J.'s, from around the corner.

23:51.515 --> 23:53.809
So, your computer's still here,

23:54.476 --> 23:55.769
couple of TVs, too.

23:55.852 --> 23:58.146
Some big-time art pieces, I noticed.

23:58.688 --> 24:01.358
Hardly big-time.
Nice, maybe.

24:01.483 --> 24:04.694
Unusual for thieves to break in
and not take anything.

24:05.612 --> 24:06.822
Well, lucky me.

24:07.864 --> 24:09.783
- You got a point?
- I don't know.

24:09.866 --> 24:12.536
If you were looking to earn
some sympathy from me,

24:12.619 --> 24:14.037
soften me up, say,

24:14.162 --> 24:16.456
a staged break-in
might be one way to do it.

24:16.540 --> 24:17.707
Interesting.

24:17.833 --> 24:21.211
Also interesting, my home had
a break-in for the first time ever

24:21.294 --> 24:23.547
on the exact day you knew I'd be out.

24:23.672 --> 24:25.132
That's a serious accusation.

24:25.215 --> 24:27.134
You just accused me of
staging a break-in.

24:27.217 --> 24:28.969
Which I did why, exactly?

24:29.052 --> 24:32.347
Maybe I won't like what I see
at the ATCU facility,

24:32.722 --> 24:34.641
so you're trying to make me like you,

24:34.724 --> 24:37.352
working me ever since the Thunderbird.

24:37.811 --> 24:40.397
Humanising yourself,
so I'll take it better.

24:41.356 --> 24:44.192
Wow, I am quite the mad genius, huh?

24:44.860 --> 24:46.987
Is all this stuff really yours?

24:47.070 --> 24:49.406
I gotta admit,
the bat, that was a nice touch.

24:49.531 --> 24:52.909
Triple Crown winners, autographs from
Mickey Mantle, Ted Williams,

24:52.993 --> 24:54.828
Frank Robinson, Carl Yastrzemski.

24:54.911 --> 24:56.663
Most people just looking at that
wouldn't know

24:56.746 --> 24:58.582
that it's worth over 7 grand, but I do.

24:58.707 --> 24:59.749
Okay, the bat is not...

24:59.833 --> 25:02.252
And burgers
from my favourite place, D.J.'s.

25:02.377 --> 25:05.839
What possible reason
would the head of the ATCU have

25:05.922 --> 25:07.716
for keeping me here with that?

25:10.760 --> 25:12.053
You're right.

25:12.929 --> 25:14.055
No reason at all.

25:16.016 --> 25:17.684
You wanna go see the facility?

25:18.268 --> 25:19.436
Fine.

25:22.606 --> 25:24.232
Let's go see the facility.

25:31.781 --> 25:33.283
<i>Okay,
each of those passports</i>

25:33.366 --> 25:35.535
<i>has a different fake identity
for Von Strucker.</i>

25:36.536 --> 25:38.622
<i>Mmm, my work is better,
just for the record.</i>

25:38.788 --> 25:40.290
- We know.
<i>- Right.</i>

25:40.373 --> 25:44.878
<i>Well, one ID matches the name
on one Strucker real estate holding,</i>

25:44.961 --> 25:46.713
<i>a penthouse in Lisbon, Portugal.</i>

25:46.796 --> 25:49.799
<i>So, I did a sweep of passengers
arriving at the Lisbon airport.</i>

25:49.925 --> 25:52.052
<i>He went through customs
several hours ago.</i>

25:52.135 --> 25:54.304
- Nice work, Fitz. Thank you.
<i>- You're welcome.</i>

25:54.387 --> 25:56.306
So, we go to a penthouse in Lisbon.

25:59.643 --> 26:01.645
You want to talk about
what happened at the bank?

26:03.480 --> 26:04.773
There's nothing to discuss.

26:06.566 --> 26:09.152
I was treating fighting as a last resort.

26:09.236 --> 26:10.237
Usually that's good.

26:10.320 --> 26:11.655
Usually.

26:11.738 --> 26:13.573
Sometimes it's 'cause you're gun shy.

26:13.657 --> 26:14.658
Maybe I'm not 100%,

26:14.783 --> 26:17.327
but you're the one who dragged me
on this mission in spite of the tests.

26:17.410 --> 26:19.162
Stop hiding behind the tests.

26:19.246 --> 26:20.288
I'm not.

26:21.414 --> 26:23.166
I said I wanted back in the field.

26:23.250 --> 26:24.334
Sure.

26:24.459 --> 26:27.504
After Bahrain, I said I hated my cubicle,
didn't mean it.

26:27.587 --> 26:30.674
Coulson says stay home,
and you just agree?

26:32.759 --> 26:34.636
Why are you keeping yourself
locked up?

26:35.303 --> 26:38.014
You know, I saw you train
at the Academy once,

26:38.139 --> 26:39.182
scouting you.

26:39.683 --> 26:40.767
I didn't know that.

26:40.850 --> 26:42.602
Strongest recruit I ever saw.

26:42.686 --> 26:45.355
Any test would have said
you were 100% then,

26:45.689 --> 26:49.693
but you're better today,
because now you have experience.

26:50.110 --> 26:51.611
What Ward did,

26:52.195 --> 26:54.030
you think that was just experience?

26:54.114 --> 26:55.865
That can make you stronger.

26:56.449 --> 26:57.617
Let it.

26:57.701 --> 27:01.288
'Cause next time, talking our way out
may not be an option.

27:06.835 --> 27:08.211
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

27:08.295 --> 27:09.963
Be careful with that one.

27:10.046 --> 27:13.008
It'd be a shame to see this whole place
blow up before we even move in.

27:14.551 --> 27:15.635
What the hell are you doing here?

27:15.719 --> 27:17.512
You're supposed to be out
looking for Von Strucker.

27:27.564 --> 27:28.565
Who is this?

27:28.690 --> 27:30.317
<i>You don't know my name,</i>

27:30.400 --> 27:33.570
<i>but I think you've been trying
to get my attention.</i>

27:33.653 --> 27:36.156
I've been wondering
when I'd hear from you.

27:36.239 --> 27:38.658
You're the one
all the others were afraid of,

27:38.742 --> 27:39.868
before me.

27:40.368 --> 27:42.829
Not everyone fears you, Mr Ward.

27:42.912 --> 27:44.664
Well, not everyone should.

27:44.748 --> 27:47.083
Just the ones who won't fall in line.

27:47.167 --> 27:48.376
What can I do for you?

27:49.711 --> 27:51.588
Now, that's not the correct question.

27:51.671 --> 27:54.174
The correct question is,
what I can offer you.

27:55.342 --> 27:58.219
The answer, in case you're wondering,
is redemption.

27:58.762 --> 28:00.597
No, thanks. I don't need redeeming.

28:00.680 --> 28:02.265
Oh, I think you do.

28:03.224 --> 28:05.769
You made some mistakes
at your gameplay.

28:06.603 --> 28:08.605
Using Von Strucker's son as a pawn

28:08.688 --> 28:10.607
when he shouldn't even be
on the board yet.

28:10.690 --> 28:14.569
You see, that's just typical
of guys in your generation.

28:14.944 --> 28:17.030
<i>You don't even know
the game I'm playing.</i>

28:17.781 --> 28:20.367
Von Strucker is more than just a pawn.

28:20.450 --> 28:22.786
And now he's a liability.

28:22.911 --> 28:24.621
He knows too much.

28:24.704 --> 28:26.456
Just tell me if I'm wrong.

28:27.791 --> 28:29.626
<i>You burned that asset.</i>

28:30.210 --> 28:32.712
S.H.I.E.L.D. is looking for him,
which means so are you.

28:34.714 --> 28:36.800
And I know where you can find him.

28:37.801 --> 28:39.427
And you'll just tell me that?

28:40.053 --> 28:41.096
Why?

28:42.263 --> 28:45.266
Sometimes you sacrifice a player
to save the game.

28:45.809 --> 28:50.647
You just remember, when I come calling,
that I chose a side.

28:54.692 --> 28:57.612
This is the place,
matches the Endotex location.

28:57.695 --> 29:00.740
With a high-voltage,
zinc-coated razor wire,

29:00.824 --> 29:04.160
iris recognition,
staggered perimeter patrols.

29:04.619 --> 29:07.705
They don't want any visitors.
That's gotta be a front, don't you think?

29:08.540 --> 29:09.582
So, what now?

29:09.666 --> 29:13.294
Now we use the new D.W.A.R.F.
Fitz crafted.

29:13.378 --> 29:15.964
He doesn't think it's ready yet,
but that's stupid because it's awesome.

29:16.047 --> 29:17.841
So I stole it.

29:20.385 --> 29:23.054
What? I didn't say
you were the only one with issues.

29:24.639 --> 29:26.015
All right.

29:48.037 --> 29:50.498
- Simmons, what do you got?
- It's negative.

29:50.582 --> 29:53.543
Banks has no Inhuman markers.
He's not Inhuman.

29:54.002 --> 29:55.295
So he's not Lash.

29:55.378 --> 29:56.671
Really?

29:57.589 --> 29:59.007
I was so sure...

30:00.884 --> 30:02.385
Okay. Thanks.

30:08.892 --> 30:10.018
Fitz?

30:12.187 --> 30:13.480
I'm done helping Daisy,

30:13.563 --> 30:15.315
and since you're done helping
Bobbi and May,

30:15.398 --> 30:19.068
I thought maybe now we could
take a look at the simulation.

30:19.194 --> 30:20.570
Um, Jemma,
I've been meaning say to you...

30:20.695 --> 30:23.156
Look, I understand
if you don't want to look into this.

30:23.239 --> 30:24.616
I'm stronger than you think. I think...

30:24.741 --> 30:26.201
No, no. No.
Jemma, I have looked into it.

30:26.284 --> 30:28.786
Actually, I've run dozens of simulations,

30:28.912 --> 30:32.248
and I kept on hoping
that one of them would work.

30:34.417 --> 30:35.585
Oh...

30:35.710 --> 30:36.753
I...

30:36.878 --> 30:38.755
I didn't want to disappoint you.

30:40.256 --> 30:42.884
The Monolith
was just one option though.

30:43.718 --> 30:45.303
We're not gonna give up, okay?

30:50.141 --> 30:51.935
I know this isn't easy for you.

30:52.435 --> 30:54.270
It's an odd situation.

30:54.395 --> 30:56.606
Yeah, it's one of the oddest.

30:56.731 --> 30:57.774
Even for us.

30:58.066 --> 31:00.652
Fitz, if you knew Will,
you'd understand, I promise you.

31:00.777 --> 31:01.778
Jemma, that's the thing.

31:01.903 --> 31:04.614
I am gonna know him.
It's not even a question.

31:25.426 --> 31:28.471
I don't care what the blood work says,
that guy Banks is shifty.

31:28.596 --> 31:30.932
You know,
he once held me prisoner on a train.

31:31.015 --> 31:32.183
Didn't care for that.

31:32.308 --> 31:36.771
Banks was still on his way here.
Endotex is obviously a front for ATCU.

31:36.854 --> 31:38.022
They're up to something here.

31:38.147 --> 31:39.524
Maybe the D.W.A.R.F.
will find something,

31:39.649 --> 31:41.651
so today won't have been pointless.

31:42.318 --> 31:44.988
Banks wanted to be here
for a delivery of something.

31:45.113 --> 31:46.364
I wonder what it is.

31:57.041 --> 31:58.543
Hey, but won't they see
the D.W.A.R.F.?

31:58.668 --> 31:59.836
They will not.

32:00.169 --> 32:01.296
That's the 2.0.

32:05.967 --> 32:08.011
Fitz should not be
keeping that locked up.

32:09.345 --> 32:11.055
Wait a minute, what is that?

32:12.056 --> 32:13.516
I don't...

32:15.476 --> 32:16.811
Clear.

32:18.313 --> 32:19.355
Right side.

32:20.523 --> 32:21.524
<i>Pick it up.</i>

32:21.733 --> 32:22.817
<i>Up!</i>

32:23.026 --> 32:24.235
Is that a person?

32:25.528 --> 32:26.571
Oh, God.

32:27.030 --> 32:28.072
Is he dead?

32:29.032 --> 32:30.283
No, they're monitoring him.

32:30.366 --> 32:31.576
He's alive.

32:31.701 --> 32:34.537
But in some kind of, what, a coma?

32:35.204 --> 32:36.664
This is ATCU.

32:39.334 --> 32:41.711
This is where
they're storing Inhumans they find.

32:42.420 --> 32:44.380
Like animals in cages.

32:47.258 --> 32:49.052
Let me get a better shot.

32:58.770 --> 33:00.021
Oh.

33:06.235 --> 33:07.654
Can we turn it up? I can't hear a thing.

33:07.737 --> 33:10.948
It's up. This is as close as we can get
without giving ourselves away.

33:11.074 --> 33:12.784
There's noise in the background.

33:14.577 --> 33:16.162
I know how it looks.

33:16.245 --> 33:17.413
He should be freaking out.

33:17.538 --> 33:19.582
This is a sort of thing
that should freak a person out.

33:19.707 --> 33:21.376
Why is he not
burning this place to the ground?

33:21.459 --> 33:23.211
He's telling her what he thinks.

33:23.294 --> 33:24.712
He's horrified like we are.

33:25.129 --> 33:26.422
It doesn't look like it.

33:27.882 --> 33:30.093
Well, bring back the D.W.A.R.F.,
make sure we're not discovered.

33:30.218 --> 33:33.054
There's no way
we're working with the ATCU now.

33:33.137 --> 33:34.430
Tremors.

33:36.099 --> 33:37.850
Daisy, the D.W.A.R.F.

33:37.934 --> 33:39.352
Bring it back.

33:39.435 --> 33:40.561
All right.

33:48.820 --> 33:50.655
It's efficient, I'll say that.

33:51.614 --> 33:53.491
What is it,
some kind of suspension gel?

33:53.616 --> 33:54.826
It keeps them in stasis.

33:54.951 --> 33:57.829
Alive, healthy, just asleep.

34:00.998 --> 34:03.918
You were right about one thing,
I didn't wanna show you.

34:04.001 --> 34:06.504
Not because I think
what we're doing here is wrong,

34:06.629 --> 34:08.005
because I know how it looks.

34:08.630 --> 34:09.799
Looks like a horror movie.

34:09.924 --> 34:11.134
But try to understand.

34:11.259 --> 34:13.511
These people were all in trouble
after they turned.

34:13.636 --> 34:15.929
Some tried hurting themselves,
some hurt loved ones.

34:16.013 --> 34:17.806
Yes, they can be dangerous,
I've seen that.

34:17.931 --> 34:19.058
But it doesn't begin at just...

34:19.141 --> 34:20.685
This thing is like an illness.

34:20.810 --> 34:23.478
But we're working on a cure,
and we're close.

34:23.563 --> 34:26.858
So close to telling those people,
"You're safe.

34:27.525 --> 34:30.402
"Your loved ones are safe,
you can go home."

34:30.485 --> 34:32.989
It's like putting someone
in a medically-induced coma

34:33.072 --> 34:34.239
to make them better.

34:35.491 --> 34:38.661
Imagine doing that for someone
who has no other shot.

34:44.667 --> 34:46.002
You lost someone.

34:47.170 --> 34:48.504
I don't know what you're talking about.

34:48.880 --> 34:51.340
I'm such an idiot for not seeing it,
I'm sorry.

34:54.010 --> 34:56.012
Big baseball fan, I'm guessing.

34:57.430 --> 34:58.723
My husband.

35:01.893 --> 35:03.561
- Not to this?
- No.

35:04.020 --> 35:06.189
- No, it was years ago.
- In the field?

35:06.522 --> 35:08.691
No, that's the funny part.

35:09.275 --> 35:11.027
I was the spy taking risks.

35:11.110 --> 35:13.821
He was a cardiologist,
an honest man, a good husband,

35:13.905 --> 35:15.531
and cancer sucks.

35:16.199 --> 35:17.533
I'm sorry.

35:20.203 --> 35:23.039
I would have given anything
to do this for him.

35:23.706 --> 35:27.376
Just put him to sleep for a little while
until someone found a cure.

35:28.419 --> 35:31.964
I can do that for those people,
for their families.

35:33.925 --> 35:35.009
I gotta be honest,

35:35.092 --> 35:36.219
- I didn't expect...
- What?

35:36.636 --> 35:37.887
That I'm human?

35:38.387 --> 35:40.097
Not all of us are.

35:40.640 --> 35:41.808
Not fully.

35:42.391 --> 35:43.476
I am.

35:43.559 --> 35:45.061
And I think you are, too.

35:45.895 --> 35:49.440
But if you tell anyone I said that,
I'll find your base and blow it up.

35:50.983 --> 35:54.153
I find it hard
to keep my humanity in all of this.

35:55.071 --> 35:57.031
Usually have to cut yourself off from it.

35:57.114 --> 35:58.991
I'm trying not to.

36:02.411 --> 36:03.579
Before,

36:04.413 --> 36:07.124
you said that you thought
I wanted you to like me.

36:07.917 --> 36:09.544
Yeah, sorry. That was...

36:09.627 --> 36:13.130
But that part might be a little true.

36:15.591 --> 36:16.843
Maybe.

36:18.344 --> 36:19.595
Good.

36:26.936 --> 36:28.104
Ready?

36:35.444 --> 36:37.822
You again. Good.

36:40.199 --> 36:41.284
Aah!

36:48.708 --> 36:51.168
All right, here we go.

37:29.707 --> 37:30.917
Strucker!

37:31.375 --> 37:34.170
Strucker, where do I find Ward?

37:34.545 --> 37:35.713
Ward...

37:36.923 --> 37:38.257
No.

37:38.341 --> 37:39.383
Please.

37:50.019 --> 37:52.730
I've taken down men
three times your size, girl.

38:04.116 --> 38:05.910
What makes you think
you could beat me?

38:09.372 --> 38:10.373
Experience.

38:22.885 --> 38:25.096
I tried to do what Ward wanted.

38:25.638 --> 38:27.264
I tried to kill him.

38:27.390 --> 38:29.809
Him, Professor Garner?

38:30.893 --> 38:32.311
We had him.

38:34.939 --> 38:37.733
But I didn't know
he changed into that thing.

38:42.154 --> 38:43.739
<i>What really happened?</i>

40:18.250 --> 40:19.710
That's not true.

40:20.503 --> 40:21.587
No?

40:23.297 --> 40:24.673
What is he?

40:29.178 --> 40:30.513
I don't know.

40:43.692 --> 40:46.195
I told you
you don't have to worry about me.

40:46.278 --> 40:48.489
Are you all right, staying safe?

40:48.572 --> 40:49.990
<i>Safe as houses.</i>

40:51.075 --> 40:52.118
<i>What?</i>

40:52.201 --> 40:53.994
It's an expression, people say that.

40:55.246 --> 40:56.580
Sure,
and some day you can tell me

40:56.664 --> 41:00.626
how you survived the Dust Bowl and
the Hoover administration, Grandpa.

41:01.502 --> 41:03.337
It's an ugly side of you, Daisy.

41:03.587 --> 41:05.840
That's too bad, you know the deal.

41:06.006 --> 41:08.467
<i>I'll stop making fun of you
when you tell me where you are.</i>

41:08.551 --> 41:09.635
Yeah.

41:11.011 --> 41:13.722
Just keep your head down, okay?

41:13.806 --> 41:16.058
I don't want this thing to find you.

41:16.142 --> 41:17.852
Do you have any friends
out there at least?

41:17.935 --> 41:19.478
Not as many as I used to.

41:20.729 --> 41:22.815
How much longer
till the call is traceable?

41:25.985 --> 41:27.528
Fifteen seconds.

41:34.869 --> 41:36.120
I'll reach out soon.

41:36.203 --> 41:37.496
I hope so.

41:45.296 --> 41:47.006
Dr Garner, hey.

41:47.089 --> 41:48.549
Was that Lincoln?

41:48.632 --> 41:50.259
Did he have anything
to help us with Lash?

41:50.342 --> 41:51.969
No, back to square one.

41:52.344 --> 41:53.387
Hmm.

41:54.680 --> 41:56.724
Don't worry, you'll figure it out soon.

41:58.559 --> 42:00.769
Hey, did Lincoln tell you where he is?

42:00.853 --> 42:02.688
I mean, he'd be safer here,
under our protection.

42:02.771 --> 42:04.857
I know, but he doesn't believe me.
He won't tell me.

42:06.025 --> 42:07.526
But I'll let you know when he does.

42:08.110 --> 42:09.153
Great.
