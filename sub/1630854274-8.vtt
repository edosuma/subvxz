WEBVTT

00:04.833 --> 00:06.125
They're in.

00:09.583 --> 00:11.541
-<i>We're getting out of here.</i>
-To go where?

00:11.625 --> 00:12.625
Anywhere we want.

00:13.541 --> 00:15.625
I got lucky.

00:15.708 --> 00:18.166
I've got enough credits
to get us anywhere.

00:18.250 --> 00:20.958
We're treating what happened
at Aldhani like a robbery.

00:21.041 --> 00:22.583
What would you call it?

00:23.791 --> 00:25.208
An announcement.

00:25.291 --> 00:27.458
You realize what you've set in motion?

00:27.541 --> 00:29.166
People will suffer.

00:31.083 --> 00:32.375
That's the plan.

00:32.458 --> 00:33.833
<i>I hope she's worth it.</i>

00:33.916 --> 00:35.333
<i>Well, we'll see, won't we?</i>

00:36.333 --> 00:37.875
We can't hide forever.

00:37.958 --> 00:41.125
I can now prove a link between the theft
of our most secret equipment

00:41.208 --> 00:43.625
and its distribution
to rebel groups across the galaxy.

00:43.708 --> 00:47.666
For the moment, I'm reassigning
the Morlana Sector to Supervisor Meero.

00:47.750 --> 00:49.875
Ferrix is of great interest to her

00:49.958 --> 00:52.208
and has clearly
become a distraction for you.

00:52.291 --> 00:55.041
<i>As long as everyone</i>
<i>thinks I'm an irritation,</i>

00:55.125 --> 00:57.291
<i>they might miss what I'm really doing.</i>

00:57.375 --> 00:58.666
What are you really doing?

00:58.750 --> 01:00.000
Raising money.

01:00.958 --> 01:02.291
Raising money for what?

01:02.375 --> 01:03.625
I'm not going.

01:03.708 --> 01:05.166
What are you talking about?

01:05.250 --> 01:08.250
You can't stay, and I can't go.

01:09.333 --> 01:10.583
<i>Morlana One.</i>

01:10.666 --> 01:13.291
I fully intend to clear my name
and have my record expunged.

01:13.375 --> 01:15.291
Why don't we start that process now?

01:17.416 --> 01:19.541
<i>There's a rebel murderer</i>
<i>running free</i>

01:19.625 --> 01:22.000
<i>because of corruption and laxity</i>
<i>in the authority.</i>

01:22.083 --> 01:23.791
Hang onto this one for me.

01:26.541 --> 01:27.750
Six years.

01:27.833 --> 01:28.875
Six years?

01:29.666 --> 01:30.666
No, no, wait!

01:30.750 --> 01:32.458
Change of guidelines.

01:32.541 --> 01:33.958
I didn't do anything!

01:34.041 --> 01:36.125
Wait. I'm just a tourist!

02:38.291 --> 02:39.458
Get in line!

02:43.250 --> 02:44.250
Move it!

02:46.375 --> 02:47.541
Don't you look at me!

02:49.125 --> 02:50.333
Move it!

02:50.416 --> 02:51.541
Keep moving!

02:51.625 --> 02:52.666
Up the stairs!

02:54.041 --> 02:55.166
Pick it up!

02:59.083 --> 03:00.125
Name?

03:00.208 --> 03:01.291
Tuck Hybecks.

03:01.375 --> 03:03.291
-Home planet?
-Galdi.

03:03.375 --> 03:05.333
Belsavis. Next.

03:07.625 --> 03:08.625
Name?

03:08.708 --> 03:10.125
Girgo. Keef Girgo.

03:10.208 --> 03:12.041
-Home planet?
-Deris-plata.

03:12.125 --> 03:13.208
Narkina Five.

03:13.291 --> 03:14.583
What? What's that?

03:14.666 --> 03:15.958
Get to your transport.

03:16.041 --> 03:17.333
-Next.
-What is that?

03:17.416 --> 03:18.666
What's Narkina Five?

03:18.750 --> 03:19.833
I'm a tourist!

03:19.916 --> 03:21.000
Move it.

03:21.083 --> 03:22.791
-Home planet?
-Giermos.

03:22.875 --> 03:24.333
Belsavis.

03:24.416 --> 03:25.458
Right there.

03:26.041 --> 03:27.083
On you go.

03:28.041 --> 03:29.750
Come on, move it, move it.

04:04.291 --> 04:06.083
Anywhere, come on, sit down!

04:07.791 --> 04:08.791
Right, shoes off!

04:08.875 --> 04:11.416
Boots, sandals, everything on the floor!

04:11.500 --> 04:12.500
Toss it in!

04:12.583 --> 04:14.916
Come on, move it, bare feet, let's go!

04:43.041 --> 04:44.541
I'm Lieutenant Dedra Meero.

04:44.625 --> 04:47.333
I'm the ISB Supervisor
for the Morlana Sector.

04:47.958 --> 04:49.416
What happened to Lieutenant Blevin?

04:49.500 --> 04:50.875
I'll ask the questions.

04:51.541 --> 04:53.666
Ferrix. I've been reviewing the incident.

04:53.750 --> 04:56.666
I was planning on calling you in
to fill some gaps in the report.

04:56.750 --> 04:58.208
We were scheduling that.

04:58.291 --> 05:00.375
But now, we've both
had our mornings interrupted

05:00.458 --> 05:03.750
because you keep requesting
the Bureau of Standards Data Center

05:03.833 --> 05:05.541
to look for Cassian Andor.

05:06.375 --> 05:09.625
You've claimed
he was a missing fuel specialist,

05:09.708 --> 05:11.750
an unresponsive energy engineer,

05:11.833 --> 05:16.291
a fuel purity field officer
suspected of forging Imperial reports.

05:16.375 --> 05:20.416
You've been here for less than a month
and you've filed five false inquiries.

05:20.500 --> 05:21.625
Six, actually.

05:21.708 --> 05:23.333
I wasn't counting this morning.

05:25.375 --> 05:27.333
What are you doing, Mr. Karn?

05:30.500 --> 05:33.458
Cassian Andor is a murderer
and a threat to the Empire.

05:33.541 --> 05:36.625
I have been trying, with the limited
tools available, to find him.

05:36.708 --> 05:38.958
So, this is about public safety?

05:41.666 --> 05:43.708
Here's what's happened, Syril.

05:45.125 --> 05:48.333
You have engaged the curiosity of the ISB.

05:52.583 --> 05:54.666
Now, is there anything
you'd care to tell me

05:54.750 --> 05:58.500
before I waste more of my time
figuring out what it is you are up to?

05:58.583 --> 06:00.000
I'm just trying to clear my name.

06:00.083 --> 06:02.791
One would think
you'd want to leave Ferrix far behind.

06:02.875 --> 06:04.916
One would be wrong.

06:07.583 --> 06:08.958
I have a busy day.

06:09.750 --> 06:13.083
Tell me, what's not in Lieutenant Blevin's
report that I need to know?

06:13.166 --> 06:15.916
I have no idea.
I wasn't allowed to see the report.

06:16.916 --> 06:19.500
-You signed it.
-I was given no choice.

06:28.958 --> 06:30.291
We should be upstairs by now.

06:30.375 --> 06:32.208
Give him Blevin's report, let him read it.

06:32.291 --> 06:34.250
-Keep him in there.
-Of all days?

06:34.333 --> 06:35.583
We have time.

07:29.250 --> 07:31.083
This is an Imperial Starpath unit.

07:31.166 --> 07:33.583
It was stolen
from the Steergard Naval yard last year.

07:33.666 --> 07:35.250
We don't know when it was taken

07:35.333 --> 07:37.500
because Steergard
was afraid to disclose its theft

07:37.583 --> 07:39.291
and thought they could hide its absence.

07:39.375 --> 07:42.833
My full report highlights the prevalence
of this problem galaxy-wide.

07:45.958 --> 07:47.166
I'm listening.

07:49.541 --> 07:53.125
This unit was found last month
on Ferrix in the Morlana One Sector.

07:53.208 --> 07:55.958
The thief was a local named Cassian Andor.

07:56.041 --> 07:59.625
He was wanted for the murder
of two Corporate Security officers.

07:59.708 --> 08:04.083
The Starpath was left behind as he escaped
the tactical team sent in to arrest him.

08:06.375 --> 08:11.583
Andor was in the act of transferring
the unit to a person we've named Axis

08:11.666 --> 08:14.125
because of his centrality
to what we believe to be

08:14.208 --> 08:18.041
an organized rebel effort
to acquire specialized Imperial gear.

08:18.125 --> 08:19.958
This is quite the wishlist.

08:20.041 --> 08:23.625
Full planetary comnet,
full Garrison tech package,

08:23.708 --> 08:29.166
Series Nine Spectrum surveillance,
local agent funding, Code Droid.

08:29.250 --> 08:30.833
All ready to go, sir.

08:30.916 --> 08:33.625
If someone there is talking,
we need to be listening.

08:33.708 --> 08:35.041
It's a large investment.

08:36.000 --> 08:38.458
It's a fraction of the price
of lost technology.

08:42.125 --> 08:46.500
So, drill down on Ferrix,
find this thief, and then what?

08:46.583 --> 08:47.750
Identify Axis.

08:47.833 --> 08:49.000
They escaped together.

08:49.083 --> 08:51.041
It's the first best lead we've had.

08:51.125 --> 08:54.291
Supervisor Meero has convinced me

08:54.375 --> 08:56.000
that this Axis has been nimble

08:56.083 --> 08:58.500
in spreading his activities
across the galaxy.

08:59.250 --> 09:04.916
And, no, we don't know who he is,
nor do we know the scope of our problem.

09:05.000 --> 09:10.375
The little we are aware
of is already troubling.

09:10.458 --> 09:12.375
Ferrix was a mistake.

09:12.458 --> 09:14.500
It's the first one he's made.

09:14.583 --> 09:17.583
Drill down is exactly
what I want to do, sir.

09:17.666 --> 09:21.166
Drill down, find Andor,
and get a hunt started.

09:31.500 --> 09:32.708
All right, move!

09:33.541 --> 09:34.541
Go!

09:34.625 --> 09:36.041
Down the ramp!

09:36.125 --> 09:38.083
Down the ramp, now!

09:39.000 --> 09:40.000
Move it!

09:40.083 --> 09:41.750
Stay right there!

09:41.833 --> 09:43.375
On program!

09:43.458 --> 09:45.750
Hands behind heads, feet down!

10:09.583 --> 10:10.875
Breathe deep, brother.

10:10.958 --> 10:13.541
This may be the last fresh air
we ever taste.

10:16.541 --> 10:18.583
Welcome to Narkina Five.

10:20.166 --> 10:22.666
This is an Imperial factory facility.

10:22.750 --> 10:25.458
You've all been assessed as labor-worthy.

10:25.541 --> 10:27.458
Now, following this introduction,

10:27.541 --> 10:30.250
you'll be transferred
to your level assignment and workroom,

10:30.333 --> 10:33.250
where your floor manager
will explain the details

10:33.333 --> 10:35.958
of our schedule and expectations.

10:36.916 --> 10:39.458
Your length of stay
has been predetermined.

10:39.541 --> 10:42.666
The quality of that time
will be up to you.

10:43.291 --> 10:46.875
Now, those who've been incarcerated
before will be surprised by the calm,

10:46.958 --> 10:52.208
sanitary conditions, and our minimally
invasive enforcement techniques.

10:54.250 --> 10:56.625
Well, I'm sure some,
if not all of you, are wondering,

10:56.708 --> 11:00.125
how we risk standing
before you without weapons?

11:00.208 --> 11:01.708
It's a potent question.

11:02.791 --> 11:06.583
And hopefully, one you won't need
to have answered very often, but...

11:21.041 --> 11:22.416
You may stand.

11:23.000 --> 11:25.458
That was level one of three.

11:25.541 --> 11:28.125
Our floors are Tunqstoid steel.

11:28.791 --> 11:31.333
Do your time productively,
keep to your lane,

11:31.416 --> 11:33.500
and this needn't be more than a memory.

11:34.291 --> 11:35.541
Good luck to you.

11:37.625 --> 11:38.625
Up!

11:39.875 --> 11:42.208
Line up! Single file!

11:43.000 --> 11:44.000
Up!

11:45.375 --> 11:46.458
Let's go!

11:52.750 --> 11:54.000
You've read the report?

11:55.958 --> 11:57.125
Worse than I feared.

11:57.708 --> 11:59.875
Criminal negligence
of my commanding officer,

11:59.958 --> 12:02.375
the total lack
of Imperial authority on Ferrix,

12:02.458 --> 12:05.916
the fact that Andor obviously had
an organized local cadre of accomplices.

12:06.750 --> 12:07.833
None of that is here.

12:07.916 --> 12:10.583
Let's talk about
the accomplice you encountered.

12:10.666 --> 12:14.041
You told Lieutenant Blevin that Andor was
in the company of an older man,

12:14.125 --> 12:15.625
tall, wearing a cloak.

12:15.708 --> 12:17.125
What's not in here?

12:19.750 --> 12:20.750
Uh...

12:21.708 --> 12:23.875
Grey cloak, grey green.

12:24.166 --> 12:26.541
Dark boots.

12:27.958 --> 12:29.125
I didn't get a good look.

12:30.708 --> 12:31.708
Uh...

12:32.375 --> 12:34.041
I heard his voice, I'd recognize it.

12:34.125 --> 12:36.375
Here's what we'll do, Mr. Karn.

12:36.458 --> 12:39.083
You'll stop filing requests for Andor.

12:39.166 --> 12:42.250
Anticipating that,
I will inform the Bureau of Standards

12:42.333 --> 12:44.875
that you were of service
to the Empire today.

12:47.416 --> 12:49.583
I was a good deputy inspector!

12:53.875 --> 12:55.083
I was very good.

12:55.166 --> 12:57.750
I solved a double murder
and found the killer in two days.

12:57.833 --> 12:59.208
I was overly ambitious, yes,

12:59.291 --> 13:01.958
but time was slipping away,
and the opportunity was real.

13:04.041 --> 13:07.291
Service to the Empire, you just said it.

13:08.666 --> 13:11.208
Can one ever be too aggressive
in preserving order?

13:13.166 --> 13:14.750
I didn't deserve what happened.

13:15.708 --> 13:17.083
I wish you luck.

13:17.166 --> 13:18.166
I'm running late.

13:19.000 --> 13:21.708
It's clear you need Andor
in order to find his partner.

13:23.458 --> 13:27.583
This is more important than the death
of two Corporate Security guards.

13:27.666 --> 13:30.041
I could be a valuable asset going forward.

13:34.208 --> 13:39.500
Raise the alarm one more time,
and it won't be me you're speaking to.

13:42.875 --> 13:44.041
Forget this happened.

14:12.583 --> 14:13.583
Stop right there.

14:14.500 --> 14:15.500
On program.

14:15.583 --> 14:19.000
That means, hands on head,
eyes front, feet on the floor.

14:19.083 --> 14:20.083
Do it.

14:25.208 --> 14:26.250
Zap rod.

14:26.333 --> 14:28.166
If I have to use it, you'll remember it.

14:28.250 --> 14:29.916
Yes? Yes?

14:31.333 --> 14:33.083
What's goin' on? Where's your partner?

14:33.166 --> 14:34.625
They had a tech problem on One.

14:34.708 --> 14:36.833
Delivery takes priority
over tech, you know that.

14:36.916 --> 14:38.375
He'll be here any second.

14:38.458 --> 14:41.666
New man ready on five-two-D,
requesting units override.

14:41.750 --> 14:43.083
<i>Copy that. Coming up.</i>

14:43.166 --> 14:44.916
That's not good.
This was on the schedule.

14:45.000 --> 14:47.375
-He can't just not turn up.
-He'll be here.

14:47.458 --> 14:49.791
<i>Override engaged.</i>
<i>Five-two, you have the floor.</i>

14:49.875 --> 14:51.375
We've got deliveries' waiting.

14:51.458 --> 14:53.916
-Eyes front.
-Let's just get him out on the Ring.

14:54.000 --> 14:55.333
Step forward, let's go, move.

14:55.416 --> 14:57.666
Step forward and stop, now, move.

14:57.750 --> 14:59.041
Stop.

14:59.125 --> 15:00.125
Eyes front, I said.

15:00.208 --> 15:01.625
Sorry, I had to wait.

15:01.708 --> 15:03.041
They were short-handed.

15:03.125 --> 15:06.083
They had to pull a guy out from Four.
I came as quick as I could.

15:06.166 --> 15:07.708
Post up. We're already behind.

15:08.375 --> 15:10.125
-We good?
-Yes, you can go.

15:11.666 --> 15:13.625
-Ready on the floor?
-Looks good.

15:13.708 --> 15:14.916
Prep for door.

15:20.708 --> 15:22.208
<i>On program.</i>

15:23.541 --> 15:25.208
Step on to the lift and stop.

15:25.750 --> 15:27.750
-Move forward.
-New man on the floor!

15:28.416 --> 15:30.250
-Move.
-Hold your positions.

15:30.333 --> 15:31.833
Step on there and stop.

15:57.791 --> 15:58.791
Step off, move.

16:00.000 --> 16:01.333
I said, step off, now!

16:01.416 --> 16:02.458
Move!

16:06.291 --> 16:09.208
This is Unit Five-Two-D.

16:10.000 --> 16:13.708
Level five, room two,
the D is for Day shift.

16:13.791 --> 16:16.916
Seven levels of factory,
seven rooms per level,

16:17.000 --> 16:21.333
seven tables per room,
seven men, each table.

16:22.250 --> 16:24.208
My name is Kino Loy.

16:24.291 --> 16:26.083
I'm the Five-Two-D unit manager.

16:27.000 --> 16:29.541
The forty-nine men
in this room answer to me.

16:29.625 --> 16:30.833
Name.

16:30.916 --> 16:31.916
Keef.

16:33.083 --> 16:34.458
Keef Girgo.

16:35.041 --> 16:36.083
He won't be back.

16:36.833 --> 16:40.291
They only come to pick up the dead
and bring their replacements.

16:40.375 --> 16:41.500
You're mine now.

16:42.750 --> 16:44.583
Off program!

16:44.666 --> 16:46.041
Back to work!

16:46.833 --> 16:47.833
Listen up.

16:48.875 --> 16:50.708
It's a 12-hour shift.

16:51.333 --> 16:56.791
Productivity is encouraged,
evaluation is constant.

16:58.375 --> 17:00.916
You have been assigned table five,

17:01.541 --> 17:03.125
which is the pod that is behind

17:03.208 --> 17:05.750
because you're not on the line
doing your job.

17:05.833 --> 17:07.458
-Can you read?
-Yeah.

17:07.541 --> 17:09.791
You see in the main boxes,
one through seven,

17:09.875 --> 17:13.041
those are the scores for the tables
in this room, on this shift.

17:13.125 --> 17:14.416
What's your table number?

17:15.291 --> 17:16.291
Five.

17:17.041 --> 17:18.416
There you go, table five.

17:18.500 --> 17:19.708
See it? At the bottom?

17:19.791 --> 17:21.541
Last place. That's you.

17:22.208 --> 17:24.125
The seven tallies are the running shift

17:24.208 --> 17:27.083
totals of all the other rooms
on this floor.

17:27.166 --> 17:30.333
You play against
all the other tables in this room,

17:30.416 --> 17:33.291
I play against all the other rooms.

17:33.375 --> 17:35.250
-Play?
-Call it what you will,

17:35.333 --> 17:39.791
the point of this conversation is that
you understand one thing most clearly.

17:40.458 --> 17:44.458
I have 249 days left of my sentence.

17:44.541 --> 17:47.791
I have a free hand in how I run this room.

17:47.875 --> 17:50.250
I'm used to being
in the top three on the level.

17:50.333 --> 17:52.791
You will wanna keep that happening.

17:52.875 --> 17:54.500
I'm sensing you understand me.

17:54.583 --> 17:56.875
Sick, injured, you talk to me.

17:56.958 --> 18:00.000
Problems with another inmate,
I'll know before you do.

18:00.833 --> 18:04.875
Losing hope, your mind,
keep it to yourself.

18:04.958 --> 18:08.458
Don't ever slow up my line.

18:09.166 --> 18:10.208
Table five.

18:13.083 --> 18:14.083
Table five!

18:19.208 --> 18:20.208
Table five?

18:20.291 --> 18:22.416
Yeah, we've been waiting.
What do we call you?

18:22.500 --> 18:23.666
Keef.

18:23.750 --> 18:25.541
I'm Jemboc. Welcome.

18:26.208 --> 18:27.208
Xaul.

18:27.916 --> 18:29.166
Taga.

18:29.250 --> 18:30.250
Ulaf.

18:31.416 --> 18:32.541
Ham.

18:32.625 --> 18:34.250
And this is Melshi.

18:34.333 --> 18:35.375
We're down ten.

18:35.916 --> 18:38.291
-We're a man short, he'll give us a pass.
-He should.

18:38.375 --> 18:39.833
-He won't.
-He's done it before.

18:39.916 --> 18:42.708
-That was months ago.
-We're down ten. You're dreaming.

18:42.791 --> 18:44.541
-He's done it before.
-We're wasting time.

18:44.625 --> 18:46.291
Down 12 before you know it.

18:46.375 --> 18:49.083
They give us a new man
with only an hour left?

18:49.166 --> 18:52.208
Forty-two minutes,
come on, boys, we can rally.

18:52.291 --> 18:54.458
-They're up there, laughing.
-Don't.

18:54.541 --> 18:56.583
-Melshi's right.
-We're wasting time.

18:56.666 --> 18:58.166
Jem thinks Kino's in charge.

18:58.250 --> 19:00.625
Hey, new guy, prepare to fry.

19:00.708 --> 19:02.666
-Keef.
-What?

19:02.750 --> 19:04.291
It's his name. Right?

19:04.958 --> 19:06.250
Keef.

19:06.958 --> 19:08.666
Work!

19:08.750 --> 19:10.583
-Ham's right, get to it.
-Fly.

19:11.208 --> 19:12.208
Stand back.

19:12.291 --> 19:14.291
Watch what I do, exactly what I do.

19:14.375 --> 19:16.083
You'll be where I am this time tomorrow.

19:16.166 --> 19:17.791
With seven men, I'm the Swing,

19:17.875 --> 19:20.541
I'll be feeding the table
so it might be a little different...

19:20.625 --> 19:22.333
-He's on the box.
-They're callin' him.

19:23.375 --> 19:24.375
No.

19:27.083 --> 19:30.416
<i>Five-Two-D shift</i>
<i>productivity levels are unacceptable.</i>

19:30.500 --> 19:31.916
<i>We're calling a new clock.</i>

19:32.000 --> 19:33.125
Okay, listen up!

19:33.958 --> 19:36.958
This will be a sprint segment.

19:37.041 --> 19:39.375
39 minutes on the tone.

19:39.458 --> 19:43.291
<i>As ever, the least</i>
<i>productive table will be disciplined.</i>

19:48.333 --> 19:49.708
-Hands away.
-Clear.

19:55.583 --> 19:56.625
Come on, boys.

19:57.416 --> 19:59.375
Let's go, let's go.

20:06.875 --> 20:08.208
Come on, come on, come on.

20:09.500 --> 20:11.125
Get busy, or get fried!

20:23.333 --> 20:24.958
Keep it going!

20:43.708 --> 20:44.708
Not for me.

20:44.791 --> 20:45.833
I'll have hers.

20:48.208 --> 20:49.291
You used to like it.

20:50.291 --> 20:51.708
I was just better at pretending.

20:51.791 --> 20:53.166
Well, that I find hard to believe.

20:53.250 --> 20:54.250
<i>Sagrona.</i>

20:54.333 --> 20:56.583
-What are we toasting?
-A quick night.

20:56.916 --> 20:58.625
-Hmm. I'll drink to that.

21:00.000 --> 21:01.750
So, the evening's agenda?

21:01.833 --> 21:04.750
I need votes to stall
the Emperor's latest overreach.

21:06.291 --> 21:07.416
Hello, Tay.

21:08.291 --> 21:10.416
Tay Kolma, how prompt you are.

21:10.500 --> 21:11.541
Perrin.

21:11.625 --> 21:13.041
Still in town, or commuting?

21:13.125 --> 21:14.875
-Bit of both.
-Something to drink?

21:14.958 --> 21:16.333
What are we having?

21:16.791 --> 21:18.458
Taste of home, eh? I'll have one.

21:18.541 --> 21:19.625
Make it three.

21:19.708 --> 21:21.041
I'm fine, thank you.

21:21.125 --> 21:23.416
-Mon is working.
-Well, there's much to be done.

21:23.500 --> 21:25.541
I don't think
you're on the menu tonight, Tay.

21:25.625 --> 21:27.958
The Senator is pitching politics,
not charity.

21:28.041 --> 21:30.625
-Saving the Empire from the Emperor.

21:30.708 --> 21:32.125
Do you remember Perrin at 15?

21:32.208 --> 21:33.208
Oh, let's not.

21:33.291 --> 21:34.875
The academy firebrand.

21:34.958 --> 21:36.583
-Two squigs again, sir?
-Please.

21:36.666 --> 21:37.875
How things change, eh?

21:39.250 --> 21:43.125
The new legislation
is definitely having an effect.

21:43.208 --> 21:46.500
The rebels might have thought that over
before blowing up Aldhani.

21:47.375 --> 21:48.375
Thank you.

21:48.458 --> 21:49.458
<i>Sagrona.</i>

21:49.541 --> 21:50.666
<i>Sagrona teema.</i>

21:53.250 --> 21:55.916
Well, good luck, feeding
the galaxy. I'm off to feed myself.

21:56.000 --> 21:57.291
Charity begins at home.

21:58.791 --> 22:00.041
I was hoping you'd come.

22:00.125 --> 22:01.541
I wish I had better news.

22:01.625 --> 22:03.166
I'm about to get very busy.

22:03.250 --> 22:05.708
The new banking regulations
are making life difficult.

22:05.791 --> 22:07.875
-Difficult or impossible?
-I don't know.

22:07.958 --> 22:11.375
They're staffing up Imperial auditors,
we'll see where they are placed.

22:11.458 --> 22:13.083
Is there anything we can do?

22:13.166 --> 22:14.500
That has its own risks.

22:15.083 --> 22:16.083
Leida.

22:16.166 --> 22:18.041
-Uh, we've met.
-Indeed.

22:19.166 --> 22:20.625
You're here all the time now.

22:20.708 --> 22:21.958
Learning to love Coruscant.

22:23.250 --> 22:24.875
Your father's looking for you.

22:24.958 --> 22:26.250
You're drinking squigs?

22:26.333 --> 22:27.916
No, I've lost my taste for it.

22:28.000 --> 22:29.000
It's disgusting.

22:29.083 --> 22:30.125
That's the point.

22:32.208 --> 22:33.416
I should find Dad.

22:33.500 --> 22:34.750
Nice to see you again.

22:36.458 --> 22:38.666
What about the money I've moved already?

22:38.750 --> 22:40.166
Not everything's tucked away.

22:40.250 --> 22:41.791
We'll find a way to explain it.

22:41.875 --> 22:43.333
So, we've given up on hiding it?

22:43.416 --> 22:45.083
How much are we worrying about?

22:45.166 --> 22:46.458
Four hundred thousand.

22:47.958 --> 22:49.083
Senator.

22:49.166 --> 22:51.708
Hi! I was just coming to get you.

22:51.791 --> 22:53.625
Perrin said you were hoarding the squigs.

22:53.708 --> 22:56.000
I always forget
you're Chandrilan at heart.

22:56.083 --> 22:59.458
And I always forget how sweet you are
when you're looking for votes.

23:27.958 --> 23:29.208
Keep it down!

23:33.166 --> 23:36.416
Keep it down!

24:12.458 --> 24:13.500
Line up!

24:14.208 --> 24:15.208
Let's go!

24:22.916 --> 24:25.458
Palpatine's frustrating,
yes, we agree.

24:25.541 --> 24:26.875
Too easily provoked? Yes.

24:26.958 --> 24:29.000
Overreactive, but...

24:29.083 --> 24:30.125
Understatement.

24:30.208 --> 24:31.291
Says what he means.

24:31.375 --> 24:34.541
We're discussing legislation,
not speeches.

24:34.625 --> 24:35.750
What does he mean?

24:35.833 --> 24:37.000
What is public order?

24:37.083 --> 24:38.750
It's an awfully big box, isn't it?

24:38.833 --> 24:42.375
The Emperor's primary charge
is to protect us, is it not?

24:42.458 --> 24:45.125
And that's what the P.O.R.D.
legislation will do.

24:45.208 --> 24:47.083
How much protection is enough?

24:47.166 --> 24:49.000
We know what too little looks like.

24:49.083 --> 24:51.875
Surveillance and prosecution
without limit.

24:51.958 --> 24:54.291
If you're doing nothing wrong,
what is there to fear?

24:54.375 --> 24:56.333
I'm fearing your definition of wrong.

24:56.416 --> 24:57.875
These are dangerous times.

24:57.958 --> 25:00.125
-Dangerous times?
-Are they not?

25:00.208 --> 25:01.416
Do you feel under threat?

25:01.500 --> 25:03.916
Personally? Here, yes.

25:04.000 --> 25:08.333
I'm at great risk of ingesting too much
of this nourishing Chandrilan hospitality.

25:23.750 --> 25:24.958
This is our block.

25:26.000 --> 25:28.041
You see the white lights?
That's the floor.

25:28.125 --> 25:29.833
White is cold, red is hot.

25:29.916 --> 25:33.666
The white lights start flashing,
you got seven seconds to get to your cell.

25:34.750 --> 25:38.250
Sensors in the floor, two men in one cell,
it's an instant fry.

25:38.833 --> 25:40.125
Fall out!

25:40.208 --> 25:41.541
Fall out, fall out, fall out.

25:42.166 --> 25:44.833
-Jem, walk the new man.
-Yeah.

25:44.916 --> 25:46.083
Okay, Kino.

25:47.041 --> 25:48.041
Come on.

25:50.333 --> 25:51.375
This is you.

25:52.750 --> 25:53.833
Your rack.

25:53.916 --> 25:56.333
Everything you need here is on the wall.

25:56.416 --> 26:02.791
Water, night light, toilet flips down,
got a plate, spoon, and shaver.

26:02.875 --> 26:04.166
-And food?

26:05.083 --> 26:06.083
The tube.

26:07.083 --> 26:08.541
You can get as much as you want.

26:09.125 --> 26:11.083
They like us healthy and fueled.

26:11.166 --> 26:14.166
Don't worry, you'll learn to eat it.

26:15.291 --> 26:18.250
Tough way to start,
getting fried twice in one day.

26:19.416 --> 26:23.458
But perhaps in a few shifts,
we can pull a winner.

26:24.416 --> 26:26.708
Winner gets taste with their food.

26:27.500 --> 26:29.208
Top table wins flavor.

26:29.291 --> 26:31.500
Last place gets fried.

26:33.541 --> 26:38.583
Right, this will be cleaned every day,
and that is your tab.

26:41.000 --> 26:42.000
What did you do?

26:45.250 --> 26:46.375
Nothing.

26:46.458 --> 26:47.500
Lot of that lately.

26:48.208 --> 26:51.708
At least you know where you stand
from the start, no surprises.

26:51.791 --> 26:53.500
Ask him already.

26:54.250 --> 26:56.458
They doubled everyone's number last month.

26:57.250 --> 26:58.583
P-O-R-D.

26:58.666 --> 27:01.291
-People must be talkin' about it.
-About what?

27:02.000 --> 27:03.791
The Public Order
Resentencing Directive.

27:03.875 --> 27:06.166
It's been a tough month here
waiting for news.

27:06.250 --> 27:08.208
Can't help but wonder
what people are saying.

27:11.750 --> 27:12.916
He's never heard of it.

27:14.000 --> 27:15.583
-He never heard of it.
-Told you.

27:15.666 --> 27:18.625
The Public Order Decree.

27:18.708 --> 27:19.958
The resentencings.

27:20.041 --> 27:22.583
-I'm sorry.
-All the rebel activity.

27:22.666 --> 27:25.041
-It's rebel nonsense.
-I don't know anything about it.

27:25.125 --> 27:27.958
-They slaughtered a garrison.
-That's not what he said.

27:28.041 --> 27:29.875
-They burned it down.
-Does it matter?

27:29.958 --> 27:31.750
We're the ones getting punished.

27:31.833 --> 27:33.208
But this guy never heard of it.

27:34.458 --> 27:35.791
Don't ever look at the number.

27:35.875 --> 27:37.708
-Double, triple, it doesn't matter.
-Hey!

27:37.791 --> 27:39.958
You're here 'til they don't want you.
Understand?

27:40.041 --> 27:41.208
Enough! Melshi!

27:41.291 --> 27:43.083
Getting out now is just a dream.

27:43.166 --> 27:44.875
Those days are over.

27:46.833 --> 27:48.375
I said, that's enough.

27:49.916 --> 27:52.291
<i>Return to</i>
<i>your cells immediately.</i>

27:52.375 --> 27:54.458
<i>Thirty seconds on red floor.</i>

28:00.583 --> 28:02.166
You don't walk in your sleep, do you?

28:03.166 --> 28:04.375
What?

28:05.000 --> 28:06.291
You'll find out.

28:06.375 --> 28:07.375
Tighten up!

28:08.041 --> 28:09.166
Hot floor!

29:00.208 --> 29:02.916
Oh, you should ask my wife.
I never look out the window.

29:03.000 --> 29:04.916
-Ah! Here she is.

29:05.000 --> 29:06.000
Your embassy hostess.

29:06.083 --> 29:07.291
The question was,

29:07.375 --> 29:10.500
how many hours a day
do we stand here admiring the view?

29:10.583 --> 29:13.291
We should. I know.

29:13.375 --> 29:14.958
-Not enough!

29:15.041 --> 29:16.166
I think I'd never leave.

29:16.250 --> 29:17.916
Well, that's always the way, isn't it?

29:18.000 --> 29:19.750
One forgets to savor the familiar.

29:19.833 --> 29:20.833
So true.

29:20.916 --> 29:22.250
We came here as children.

29:22.333 --> 29:25.666
-To visit?
-No, Mon became a Senator at 16.

29:25.750 --> 29:26.916
So this is where you met?

29:27.000 --> 29:29.291
No, we'd already been married a year.

29:29.375 --> 29:30.833
That's so romantic.

29:30.916 --> 29:31.916
And traditional.

29:32.583 --> 29:33.875
The old ways of Chandrila.

29:33.958 --> 29:35.333
As was the custom.

29:35.416 --> 29:36.750
To each people its own.

29:37.833 --> 29:39.875
Speaking of, have you seen Tay?

29:40.541 --> 29:41.666
No, he left.

29:41.750 --> 29:43.416
He said he had an early morning.

29:43.500 --> 29:44.541
Well, of course.

29:45.333 --> 29:46.666
Excuse me if you will.

29:46.750 --> 29:48.000
So nice to meet you.

29:48.083 --> 29:51.083
I'm going to spend more time
at this window, I promise you.

30:34.416 --> 30:35.458
Tighten up!

31:23.458 --> 31:24.458
Flight.

31:28.000 --> 31:30.166
Three's off two, they're at 18.

31:30.833 --> 31:32.208
Four is struggling.

31:33.166 --> 31:34.166
Flight.

31:34.250 --> 31:35.250
Hands away.

31:35.333 --> 31:36.708
-Clear.
-Clear.

31:39.208 --> 31:40.291
Away!

31:41.125 --> 31:42.416
-Flight!
-Clear!

31:45.375 --> 31:47.541
All right, come on, come on, come on.

31:50.625 --> 31:51.625
Ready?

31:52.875 --> 31:54.416
-I think so.
-It's tight.

31:54.500 --> 31:55.500
Flip it.

32:04.583 --> 32:05.833
-Ready up?
-Ready up.

32:05.916 --> 32:07.250
Well, hang on, hang on.

32:07.333 --> 32:09.250
-You okay?
-Pin jam.

32:09.333 --> 32:10.916
Xaul, help him.

32:11.000 --> 32:12.000
Yeah. Come on, mate.

32:18.208 --> 32:19.375
Hey!

32:20.708 --> 32:22.750
You just takin' a breather?

32:23.416 --> 32:24.458
Come on, guys!

32:24.541 --> 32:26.500
You got a chance of winning
the shift today!

32:27.541 --> 32:28.833
Be a shame to waste it.

32:29.583 --> 32:30.791
Keef.

32:31.750 --> 32:32.916
Keef!

32:36.750 --> 32:38.416
-Yeah.
-Yes!

32:38.500 --> 32:39.625
Drill in!

33:01.333 --> 33:04.333
It's not complaining
if you tell me what's going on.

33:04.416 --> 33:06.416
Oh, you're freezing!

33:07.125 --> 33:09.833
My mother was a whiner
and that'll cure you.

33:12.083 --> 33:14.750
I'm just trying to figure out
if you need a doctor or not.

33:14.833 --> 33:16.791
She has p-p-pain in the knee.

33:16.875 --> 33:18.625
The doctor was here yesterday.

33:20.375 --> 33:21.875
Your breathing sounds weak.

33:22.875 --> 33:24.250
You got dizzy again.

33:25.333 --> 33:26.791
What have you done now?

33:27.583 --> 33:29.375
Apparently I'm throwing a party.

33:29.458 --> 33:31.666
I heard the boys
had to carry you back here.

33:31.750 --> 33:33.375
Oh! Word travels fast.

33:33.458 --> 33:34.458
She fell.

33:42.416 --> 33:44.166
<i>What was she doing by the hotel?</i>

33:44.833 --> 33:46.458
She's obsessed with Troopers.

33:47.291 --> 33:49.625
She fell trying to pry open
the old Rix flood gate.

33:50.583 --> 33:52.541
-She gonna flush them out?
-No.

33:53.416 --> 33:56.291
She wanted to see if the tunnel
under the hotel was still open.

33:57.416 --> 33:58.416
Why?

33:59.083 --> 34:01.833
So the Rebellion can sneak in
and take them by surprise.

34:03.958 --> 34:04.958
She's a Rebel.

34:08.750 --> 34:10.375
I should be coming by more often.

34:10.458 --> 34:11.875
She's not your mother.

34:11.958 --> 34:13.041
Or yours.

34:15.333 --> 34:18.208
-She can't stay here much longer.
-Good luck with that.

34:18.291 --> 34:19.958
What about the Daughters of Ferrix?

34:20.041 --> 34:21.416
She's a past president.

34:21.500 --> 34:23.125
They must have a warm room somewhere.

34:23.208 --> 34:24.208
They've tried.

34:24.291 --> 34:25.791
She's made her wishes clear.

34:29.375 --> 34:30.375
Cassian.

34:31.625 --> 34:33.125
You really don't know where he is?

34:49.083 --> 34:50.375
Where did you go?

34:50.458 --> 34:51.541
Who's the big one?

34:52.375 --> 34:53.416
I've no idea.

34:54.541 --> 34:56.750
Where were you?
I was about to come lookin'.

34:57.708 --> 34:58.833
Cold now.

35:02.958 --> 35:03.958
What?

35:05.083 --> 35:07.083
There's a room to rent around the corner.

35:07.166 --> 35:08.666
They have a sign up.

35:08.750 --> 35:10.125
Can't just stay here.

35:10.208 --> 35:11.208
I can.

35:12.083 --> 35:13.083
Alone?

35:14.333 --> 35:16.250
Two of us would draw too much attention.

35:16.333 --> 35:17.625
You'll stay here and wait?

35:17.708 --> 35:19.833
Just hope he shows up?

35:19.916 --> 35:21.708
-Could be anywhere.
-This is all we have.

35:21.791 --> 35:22.875
What's the alternative?

35:24.291 --> 35:26.250
Haven't we been apart long enough?

35:26.333 --> 35:27.875
It's not about us.

35:29.333 --> 35:30.916
After what we've been through?

35:32.958 --> 35:35.333
You think the Empire
stops to catch its breath?

35:36.833 --> 35:38.666
This is a fight to the death, Vel.

35:42.166 --> 35:43.541
Who would you say you are?

35:46.125 --> 35:49.083
Maybe I'm a rich girl
running away from her family.

35:50.083 --> 35:51.250
Well, that's cold.

35:53.000 --> 35:54.125
Even for you.

35:56.166 --> 35:59.583
I told you upfront
the struggle will always come first.

35:59.666 --> 36:01.000
We take what's left.

36:12.250 --> 36:13.791
I'm a mirror, Vel.

36:15.958 --> 36:19.000
You love me because I show you
what you need to see.

36:21.958 --> 36:22.958
Thank you.

36:23.041 --> 36:24.125
Sure.

36:24.208 --> 36:25.625
Well, I'll keep an eye.

36:41.041 --> 36:42.041
Paak?

36:44.458 --> 36:45.666
Are you as slow as I am?

36:45.750 --> 36:47.833
Yeah, losing the hotel
is not good for business.

36:47.916 --> 36:50.666
We need a meeting.
There's gotta be something we can do.

36:50.750 --> 36:53.625
-What's up?
-I need to look for something in the back.

36:54.833 --> 36:56.333
Not sure that's a good idea.

36:56.416 --> 36:58.500
-It's been off for a while.
-It's urgent.

37:01.250 --> 37:02.416
All right.

37:29.500 --> 37:30.541
Kleya?

37:34.000 --> 37:35.000
Kleya?

37:42.625 --> 37:44.208
It's the shop owner on Ferrix.

37:44.291 --> 37:46.833
She's trying to find Cassian Andor.
His mother is ill.

37:49.500 --> 37:51.708
We're not answering. We can't.

37:51.791 --> 37:53.333
She could show the right direction.

37:53.416 --> 37:54.416
She's asking us.

37:54.500 --> 37:55.750
She knows more than we do.

37:55.833 --> 37:57.416
So much more.
She might have a lead.

37:57.500 --> 37:59.416
More likely
it's the ISB working her radio.

37:59.500 --> 38:01.708
-You're guessing!
-And you're slipping!

38:05.000 --> 38:06.541
We're shutting down Ferrix.

38:06.625 --> 38:08.375
The code, the frequency, all of it.

38:08.458 --> 38:10.791
I'm thinking clearly and you're not.

38:13.125 --> 38:14.333
Tell me to shut it down.

38:17.791 --> 38:18.875
It's Andor.

38:20.166 --> 38:24.250
Knowing he's out there, knowing me,
not knowing what he knows.

38:26.541 --> 38:27.875
I took him on the Fondor.

38:28.875 --> 38:30.000
Was I insane?

38:30.083 --> 38:32.458
You were desperate
for Aldhani to work and it did.

38:32.541 --> 38:34.583
And we'll find him, just not like this.

38:34.666 --> 38:36.000
Vel was out hunting.

38:36.083 --> 38:37.166
She and Cinta.

38:37.250 --> 38:39.166
-Are they in Ferrix yet?
-I'll have a listen.

38:39.250 --> 38:41.166
We're being extremely careful with it.

38:42.208 --> 38:44.333
The woman's name is Bix Caleen.

38:44.416 --> 38:46.125
Vel could have a look if it's safe.

38:46.208 --> 38:47.791
They know what they're doing.

38:51.166 --> 38:52.583
I'm not slipping, Kleya.

38:53.666 --> 38:55.208
I've just been hiding for too long.

38:56.000 --> 38:57.416
It's all different now.

38:57.500 --> 38:58.750
We're going loud.

38:58.833 --> 39:00.750
Vulnerability is inevitable.

39:01.791 --> 39:02.833
I'm not slipping.

39:03.666 --> 39:04.791
I know.

39:04.875 --> 39:06.541
I just need you to wake up.

39:06.625 --> 39:08.166
There's a lot to do.

39:10.291 --> 39:11.291
Shut it down.

40:28.833 --> 40:31.541
Coordinate alternatives for Segra Milo.

40:31.625 --> 40:32.625
<i>Calculating.</i>

40:33.708 --> 40:34.833
<i>Four potential routes.</i>

40:34.916 --> 40:36.500
Let's take the long way around.

40:37.750 --> 40:39.541
<i>Re-routing Segra Milo.</i>

41:01.875 --> 41:03.208
No, no, no, no!

41:03.291 --> 41:04.291
Aw, man.

41:04.375 --> 41:05.708
-Who is it now?
-No!

41:05.791 --> 41:06.791
He railed it!

41:06.875 --> 41:08.250
-Who?
-Veemoss!

41:08.333 --> 41:09.416
Veemoss!

41:09.500 --> 41:11.208
Table three, the tall one.

41:11.291 --> 41:12.916
He fell! Or jumped!

41:13.333 --> 41:15.541
Aw, man, well,
we'll be smellin' him all night.

41:15.625 --> 41:17.333
Here? He rails it here?

41:17.416 --> 41:18.916
He was slipping. You could see it.

41:19.000 --> 41:21.708
I don't care, man.
You rail here at night, I got no sympathy.

41:21.791 --> 41:22.791
Shut up about it.

41:22.875 --> 41:24.583
You'll be shorthanded
all day tomorrow.

41:24.666 --> 41:26.541
Think about that
when you're gettin' fried.

41:26.625 --> 41:28.583
Enough! Let's quiet down!

41:28.666 --> 41:30.916
<i>Level five, grid disruption.</i>

41:31.500 --> 41:34.375
<i>You have ten seconds</i>
<i>to get to your sleeping platforms.</i>

41:49.916 --> 41:51.708
Move, move, move!

41:54.916 --> 41:55.916
What's going on?

41:56.000 --> 41:57.000
It's Paak's yard.

41:57.083 --> 41:58.875
I'm not sure. They're all over it.

42:04.916 --> 42:05.958
Detained for what?

42:07.041 --> 42:08.416
Why won't you tell me?

42:08.500 --> 42:10.333
Where are they taking my father?

42:10.416 --> 42:12.125
Tell me! Where is he?

42:12.208 --> 42:13.500
Where is my father?

42:13.583 --> 42:15.416
-Shut him up!
-Silence!

42:19.291 --> 42:21.416
-What's going on?
-They took Paak in last night.

42:21.500 --> 42:24.458
-Where?
-The hotel. He never came home.

42:25.291 --> 42:27.750
Get these people back. I want a perimeter.

42:27.833 --> 42:30.291
Two and two, up and down, clear the lane!

42:30.375 --> 42:31.375
Yes, sir!

42:32.708 --> 42:34.791
-Let's go!
-You okay?

42:35.833 --> 42:37.916
-I don't know.
-Move it.

42:38.000 --> 42:39.916
Let's go, let's go!

42:40.000 --> 42:41.166
Get out of the way!

42:42.000 --> 42:43.083
Move it!

42:47.000 --> 42:48.083
Caleen!

42:50.208 --> 42:51.250
Bix Caleen!

42:52.708 --> 42:54.083
That's your name, isn't it?

42:55.083 --> 42:57.000
If not, the resemblance is quite striking.

42:57.083 --> 42:58.500
Get to Zorby's. Run!

42:59.291 --> 43:00.666
Get her!

43:00.750 --> 43:03.541
-Move! Move! Move!
-Sorry. Excuse me. Sorry.

43:04.166 --> 43:05.166
Go!

43:10.791 --> 43:12.166
Get her!

43:35.083 --> 43:40.833
So, my friend,
the garrison at Aldhani, was that you?

43:40.916 --> 43:43.333
I was just about to ask you
the same thing.

43:43.416 --> 43:44.958
You'd never tell me if it was.

43:46.083 --> 43:47.583
Somebody's sitting on some dosh.

43:47.666 --> 43:49.833
If it's you,
I'm hoping you'll put it to good use.

43:49.916 --> 43:51.958
Would I be out here in the cold

43:52.041 --> 43:54.333
if I had just pinched
a 100 million credits?

43:54.416 --> 43:56.083
That's exactly what you'd do.

43:58.000 --> 44:00.750
And that's exactly
what I would say if I were you.

44:00.833 --> 44:03.666
If you're trying to convince me
it was you, it's working.

44:04.500 --> 44:05.750
Let's agree.

44:05.833 --> 44:08.041
-It was a masterpiece.
-Well, now I'm sure.

44:11.875 --> 44:15.416
Aren't you tired of playing
behind the scenes, Luthen?

44:15.500 --> 44:18.291
Aren't you tired of fighting
with people who agree with you?

44:18.375 --> 44:19.875
You come all this way to scold me?

44:21.458 --> 44:23.250
Or did you bring me some toys?

44:23.541 --> 44:24.625
Hmm.

44:24.708 --> 44:26.208
I did, but they're not for free.

44:26.291 --> 44:27.375
Nothing with you is free.

44:27.458 --> 44:29.750
Not every operation is as flush as yours.

44:31.416 --> 44:32.500
Tell me what you've got.

44:32.583 --> 44:36.041
Well, how about a full set
of Imperial drive adapters?

44:36.125 --> 44:39.291
I've also got three sealed
Steergard targeting deflectors.

44:39.541 --> 44:40.541
Mmm.

44:40.750 --> 44:43.375
You have this all here with you?

44:46.291 --> 44:47.291
At what cost?

44:48.458 --> 44:49.541
Anto Kreegyr.

44:50.458 --> 44:53.291
-I want you to meet him.
-Anto Kreegyr?

44:53.375 --> 44:56.083
He's been probing
the Imperial power station at Spellhaus.

44:56.166 --> 44:57.916
He's found a weakness in the defenses.

44:58.000 --> 45:00.625
It may take some time to work up,
but he's got an angle.

45:00.708 --> 45:01.916
The man's an ox!

45:02.000 --> 45:03.875
Slow! And stupid!

45:03.958 --> 45:04.958
And strong.

45:05.041 --> 45:07.375
I want you to hear his plan.
He'll need air support.

45:07.458 --> 45:08.666
Let's just keep this simple.

45:08.750 --> 45:11.458
I'll take all three deflectors. How much?

45:11.541 --> 45:13.541
Well, you meet with Kreegyr, they're free.

45:13.625 --> 45:15.541
-You don't, I won't sell.
-I work alone.

45:15.625 --> 45:17.041
That's what I'm trying to change.

45:17.125 --> 45:20.458
I'm not gonna put my people
at risk for someone else.

45:20.541 --> 45:22.291
We need to pull together, Saw!

45:24.500 --> 45:26.625
Whatever our final version
of success looks like,

45:26.708 --> 45:29.500
there's no chance any of us
can make it real on our own.

45:30.458 --> 45:31.875
We need the Empire to help.

45:31.958 --> 45:33.125
We need them angry.

45:33.208 --> 45:34.875
We need them coming down hard.

45:37.041 --> 45:38.666
Oppression breeds rebellion.

45:40.208 --> 45:41.333
Kreegyr needs air support.

45:41.416 --> 45:43.000
-I'm not for hire.
-Think of it.

45:44.208 --> 45:46.416
Think of Spellhaus in flames.

45:46.500 --> 45:49.000
Neither of you could do it on your own,
but together...

45:49.083 --> 45:51.083
Kreegyr's a separatist.

45:52.000 --> 45:53.750
Maya Pei's a neo-Republican.

45:54.625 --> 45:56.458
The Ghorman front.

45:56.541 --> 45:58.166
The Partisan alliance?

45:58.875 --> 45:59.875
Sectorists.

45:59.958 --> 46:01.500
Human cultists?

46:01.583 --> 46:03.291
Galaxy partitionists.

46:03.375 --> 46:04.416
They're lost!

46:05.125 --> 46:06.333
All of them, lost!

46:07.666 --> 46:08.666
Lost!

46:14.750 --> 46:16.916
What are you, Luthen?

46:19.958 --> 46:21.208
I've never really known.

46:23.666 --> 46:24.666
What are you?

46:29.166 --> 46:30.791
I'm a coward.

46:31.833 --> 46:33.250
I'm a man who's terrified

46:33.333 --> 46:35.625
the Empire's power
will grow beyond the point

46:35.708 --> 46:37.583
where we can do anything to stop it.

46:37.666 --> 46:38.791
I'm the one who says,

46:38.875 --> 46:42.541
"We'll die with nothing if we don't put
aside our petty differences."

46:42.625 --> 46:43.666
Petty?

46:45.625 --> 46:50.333
I am the only one with clarity of purpose.

46:53.375 --> 46:56.208
Well, anarchy is a seductive concept.

46:57.458 --> 47:01.333
A bit of a luxury I'd argue
to a man who is hiding in cold caves,

47:02.166 --> 47:03.666
and begging for spare parts.

47:13.791 --> 47:15.166
No sale today, Luthen.

47:16.000 --> 47:17.416
Good luck with Anto Kreegyr.

47:34.500 --> 47:36.083
She's on her way up.

47:36.166 --> 47:37.750
Would you like us to clear the room?

47:37.833 --> 47:38.833
No.

47:39.500 --> 47:40.750
I want her to see him.

47:52.833 --> 47:55.541
What are you doing?
Get him out of here.

47:56.208 --> 47:58.291
-Quickly.
-You two, with me.

47:59.041 --> 48:00.041
Now!

48:01.416 --> 48:02.750
-Paak.

48:04.875 --> 48:06.375
Paak. Hey.

48:15.250 --> 48:16.416
Hello, Bix.

48:31.625 --> 48:33.458
-Let's go!
-Come on, come on!

48:33.541 --> 48:34.583
Hands away!

48:34.666 --> 48:35.708
Clear!

48:37.125 --> 48:38.166
Good?

48:40.250 --> 48:41.291
All right.

48:41.375 --> 48:43.166
Okay, ready?

48:44.208 --> 48:46.375
-Bring it. Bring it in.
-Come on, boys, yes.

48:58.541 --> 48:59.958
It's good, it's good.
