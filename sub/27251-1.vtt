00:23.891 --> 00:24.857
"... And as she walked down

00:24.892 --> 00:26.859
the brightly-decorated
streets of Derryville,

00:26.894 --> 00:29.828
Amanda finally felt at home.

00:29.864 --> 00:32.131
Peaceful, harmonious,

00:32.165 --> 00:34.867
and a place where everyone
knows each other's business,

00:34.902 --> 00:36.535
good or bad,

00:36.570 --> 00:38.470
and where
you can't walk past anyone

00:38.506 --> 00:41.006
without stopping to say hello,

00:41.042 --> 00:42.508
Derryville was the home

00:42.543 --> 00:44.009
she had always been
searching for.

00:45.179 --> 00:46.111
Looking around,

00:46.147 --> 00:48.213
Amanda realized Derryville
was at its peak

00:48.249 --> 00:50.049
during the Christmas season.

00:50.084 --> 00:51.250
She smiled with excitement,

00:51.285 --> 00:54.453
knowing she would be there
for the annual holiday festival.

00:54.488 --> 00:56.855
But this year
would be different.

00:56.891 --> 00:58.390
This year,
she would look forward

00:58.426 --> 01:00.059
to so much more
than Christmas trees

01:00.094 --> 01:01.326
and opening presents,

01:01.362 --> 01:03.862
because, this year,

01:03.898 --> 01:05.831
she would open her heart
to love".

01:07.435 --> 01:09.246
And that's chapter 12
of "Small Town Christmas".

01:09.270 --> 01:10.702
Thank you all for coming.

01:12.540 --> 01:13.980
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Nell Phillips!

01:15.743 --> 01:16.787
If you'd like to stick around,

01:16.811 --> 01:18.844
Ms. Phillips will be signing
copies of her book.

01:18.879 --> 01:20.159
They make great Christmas gifts!

01:22.750 --> 01:23.582
Thank you so much
for doing this.

01:23.617 --> 01:24.750
Of course.

01:24.785 --> 01:26.385
I love meeting everyone.

01:26.420 --> 01:27.386
I love your book so much.

01:27.421 --> 01:28.320
Don't you wish

01:28.355 --> 01:29.955
a place like Derryville
actually existed?

01:33.627 --> 01:35.160
All right, Santa Claus,

01:35.196 --> 01:36.706
I promised I'd donate
next time I saw you.

01:36.730 --> 01:37.830
I made good on it.

01:37.865 --> 01:39.231
Merry Christmas!

01:39.266 --> 01:41.266
Oh! Ester!

01:41.302 --> 01:42.835
You don't want to lose
your star.

01:42.870 --> 01:44.870
Merry Christmas!

01:46.407 --> 01:48.340
Steve! Hey!
Merry Christmas!

01:48.375 --> 01:49.686
Are you going to go
finally fix the pothole?

01:49.710 --> 01:50.921
I am hoping
for a Christmas miracle.

01:50.945 --> 01:52.711
Third time's a charm.
Go get it.

01:52.746 --> 01:53.779
Here's hoping.

01:53.814 --> 01:55.058
- Merry Christmas, buddy.
- Thanks!

01:55.082 --> 01:57.082
I'm sorry!

01:57.118 --> 01:58.016
Goodness, Emmett!

01:58.052 --> 01:59.184
Hi!

01:59.220 --> 02:00.853
Would you like a ginger snap?

02:00.888 --> 02:01.920
I made those fresh.

02:01.956 --> 02:03.633
Running into you
is the sweetest part of my day.

02:03.657 --> 02:06.058
Merry Christmas.
Mrs. Ferguson.

02:06.093 --> 02:08.794
All right, one more!

02:08.829 --> 02:10.529
By the way,

02:10.564 --> 02:13.098
Norma's granddaughter
was asking about you again.

02:13.134 --> 02:14.199
I was wondering,

02:14.235 --> 02:16.213
would you mind if I give her
your telephone number?

02:16.237 --> 02:17.814
I'm sorry, Mrs. Ferguson,
I can't hear you.

02:17.838 --> 02:19.872
The cookies...
they're too delicious.

02:19.907 --> 02:21.607
Merry Christmas!

02:31.318 --> 02:32.384
There you go.

02:32.419 --> 02:34.653
Thank you so much.
Merry Christmas!

02:34.688 --> 02:35.621
Thank you very much.

02:35.656 --> 02:37.289
Some extra fuel.

02:37.324 --> 02:38.891
Thank you, Caroline.

02:38.926 --> 02:40.058
I have to admit,

02:40.094 --> 02:41.727
I'm glad this tour
is finally over.

02:41.762 --> 02:42.728
No, no, no, no.

02:42.763 --> 02:43.996
Not until you tape

02:44.031 --> 02:44.997
the "Hello Chicago"
interview today.

02:45.032 --> 02:47.099
Then you can take
a nice long holiday break...

02:48.636 --> 02:50.002
and start the sequel.

02:50.037 --> 02:51.403
You don't stop, do you?

02:51.438 --> 02:52.871
And that's why
you signed with me.

02:54.475 --> 02:55.908
Well, you got me there.

02:59.813 --> 03:01.046
Hey, Brad.

03:01.081 --> 03:02.959
Is that report on Springdale
ready for me to take a look at?

03:02.983 --> 03:04.416
It sure is.

03:04.451 --> 03:05.317
All right.
Let's see what you've got.

03:05.352 --> 03:07.119
Research doesn't lie.

03:07.154 --> 03:10.589
Springdale is America's
best-kept Christmas secret.

03:10.624 --> 03:12.991
It is the perfect candidate
to be revitalized.

03:13.027 --> 03:15.027
Now, I think if we act quickly,

03:15.062 --> 03:16.428
we could turn it
into next year's

03:16.463 --> 03:18.263
hottest holiday
destination spot.

03:18.299 --> 03:20.766
We'll have all the luxuries
of a big city,

03:20.801 --> 03:22.681
without losing that small-town
Christmas spirit.

03:23.704 --> 03:25.470
We could be looking at

03:25.506 --> 03:27.372
an exponential return
on our investment.

03:27.408 --> 03:29.508
Just like you did in Wallisport.

03:29.543 --> 03:30.375
I've got to say, Brad,

03:30.411 --> 03:31.488
this is all
looking very promising.

03:31.512 --> 03:33.111
Thank you.

03:33.147 --> 03:34.347
You know, for a moment there,

03:34.381 --> 03:35.214
I was worried that you were
dragging us there for nothing.

03:35.249 --> 03:37.482
I know, I know,
it's close to Christmas,

03:37.518 --> 03:39.718
but trust me on this, Lance,

03:39.753 --> 03:40.819
being there in person

03:40.854 --> 03:42.532
is the only way to see
Springdale's full potential.

03:42.556 --> 03:43.689
I mean, it is...

03:43.724 --> 03:44.724
it's utterly charming.

03:44.758 --> 03:46.291
I'm looking forward to it.

03:46.327 --> 03:47.359
Me too.

03:52.499 --> 03:57.636
<i>Welcome back
to "Hello Chicago" with Ricki.</i>

03:57.671 --> 04:00.038
How does it feel to see
your debut novel do so well,

04:00.074 --> 04:01.707
so quickly?

04:01.742 --> 04:03.220
As a writer, even I don't have
the words for it.

04:03.244 --> 04:06.211
The town you paint is so rich.

04:06.247 --> 04:07.324
Is it based
on your own hometown?

04:07.348 --> 04:08.180
Actually, no.

04:08.215 --> 04:10.382
We moved around a lot
when I was a kid

04:10.417 --> 04:11.717
because of my parents' work.

04:11.752 --> 04:13.552
I've never told anyone this,

04:13.587 --> 04:14.553
but Derryville

04:14.588 --> 04:16.387
is actually based
on a town called Springdale.

04:16.423 --> 04:17.755
It's in Wisconsin.

04:17.791 --> 04:19.156
I see.

04:19.192 --> 04:20.269
You must have taken
trips there then?

04:20.293 --> 04:22.794
Believe it or not,
I have never been to Springdale.

04:24.131 --> 04:26.198
An old co-worker of mine
grew up there

04:26.233 --> 04:27.833
and he used to tell me
stories about it.

04:29.403 --> 04:31.737
It sounded so idyllic,

04:31.772 --> 04:34.439
I felt inspired to set the book
in a town just like it.

04:34.475 --> 04:35.774
That's incredible.

04:35.809 --> 04:39.077
How does your co-worker
feel about the book?

04:39.113 --> 04:41.046
I don't know.

04:41.081 --> 04:42.214
We've lost touch.

04:44.551 --> 04:47.319
Look up bookstores
in Springdale, Wisconsin.

04:55.963 --> 04:56.862
All right, kiddo.

04:56.897 --> 04:58.930
Look, I got a little
brain food for you.

04:58.966 --> 04:59.931
Why don't you take a break?

04:59.967 --> 05:02.567
Do you think
I'm getting everything right?

05:02.603 --> 05:05.003
Well, let me
take a look here, Peanut.

05:07.241 --> 05:08.318
I think that your math homework

05:08.342 --> 05:10.742
is starting to look
like a foreign language to me.

05:10.778 --> 05:12.010
Besides, you know,

05:12.046 --> 05:14.713
your teacher said that you're
way ahead of your classmates.

05:14.748 --> 05:16.715
She said that
you stay inside during recess

05:16.750 --> 05:17.994
so that
you can finish extra work.

05:18.018 --> 05:19.951
How else
am I going to stay ahead?

05:21.689 --> 05:22.721
Sweetheart,

05:22.756 --> 05:24.756
you don't have to be ahead
of anything or anyone.

05:24.792 --> 05:27.059
You're perfect
just the way that you are.

05:28.429 --> 05:31.930
Besides, you're 9 years old
and it's Christmas break.

05:31.965 --> 05:33.131
You need to live a little.

05:35.202 --> 05:37.069
Hang on.

05:40.474 --> 05:42.018
PaigeTurner Books,
this is Emmett speaking.

05:42.042 --> 05:43.608
Hello.
This is Caroline Lucas.

05:43.644 --> 05:45.277
I would like to speak to someone

05:45.312 --> 05:46.756
<i>about scheduling
a book signing event.</i>

05:46.780 --> 05:49.181
Well, you are speaking to
the right someone.

05:49.216 --> 05:51.783
Great, it's for an author
by the name of Nell Phillips.

05:53.654 --> 05:55.754
I'm sorry, did you say
Nell Phillips?

06:03.564 --> 06:05.508
So how come you never mentioned
Springdale before?

06:05.532 --> 06:07.632
Because I have a terrific idea!

06:07.668 --> 06:10.202
I am sending you there
for one last stop on the tour!

06:10.237 --> 06:11.136
No.

06:11.171 --> 06:12.838
No, no. I've got to get home
to New York.

06:12.873 --> 06:15.107
Think of all the positive press
the book will get.

06:15.142 --> 06:17.042
"Best-selling author

06:17.077 --> 06:19.244
finally visits
real-life inspiration".

06:21.749 --> 06:24.116
Please,
I would really rather not.

06:24.151 --> 06:26.318
I'm sorry, Nell, it's all set.

06:26.353 --> 06:27.519
I spoke to the bookstore

06:27.554 --> 06:28.353
and they've arranged

06:28.389 --> 06:29.821
some local events
for you to attend.

06:29.857 --> 06:31.123
And guess what?

06:31.158 --> 06:32.824
This is all a joke?

06:32.860 --> 06:36.128
You know that co-worker

06:36.163 --> 06:37.696
that you mentioned
in your interview?

06:37.731 --> 06:40.332
The one
in your acknowledgements?

06:40.367 --> 06:42.401
Well, it turns out that
he runs the bookstore!

06:42.436 --> 06:43.268
You know, I think that

06:43.303 --> 06:44.703
my phone call
kind of surprised him.

06:46.006 --> 06:47.172
Emmett?

06:47.207 --> 06:48.640
You spoke to Emmett Turner?

06:50.077 --> 06:51.087
And he seemed very excited

06:51.111 --> 06:53.044
that you wanted
to come and visit Springdale.

06:54.915 --> 06:56.782
Only I don't want
to visit Springdale.

07:04.291 --> 07:06.011
Book club
potluck chicken, check.

07:08.195 --> 07:10.695
Hayley, why don't you sit down
and give yourself a rest?

07:11.899 --> 07:13.098
I'm fine!

07:13.133 --> 07:14.332
You sound just like Steve.

07:14.368 --> 07:15.700
He's a wise man.

07:15.736 --> 07:16.935
Ooh, speaking of Steve,

07:16.970 --> 07:19.738
I need him to build me a podium
for the Kringlefest stage.

07:19.773 --> 07:20.806
Yes, thank you!

07:20.841 --> 07:23.241
That might actually make him
stop building cribs.

07:23.277 --> 07:26.011
He's obsessed with getting
this new nursery done.

07:26.046 --> 07:27.179
Well, do you blame him?

07:27.214 --> 07:27.879
I mean, you only get
to celebrate

07:27.915 --> 07:29.025
your first child once, right?

07:29.049 --> 07:30.749
That's true.

07:30.784 --> 07:32.451
Also, I really do need you

07:32.486 --> 07:34.786
to order me some more
of those "how to" titles,

07:34.822 --> 07:36.922
because we only have
one more month to go

07:36.957 --> 07:38.190
and we have a lot to learn.

07:38.225 --> 07:39.057
Well, you know what,

07:39.092 --> 07:40.570
it's on the list,
so consider it done.

07:40.594 --> 07:41.693
Thank you.

07:43.096 --> 07:44.629
Mayor Deakins.

07:44.665 --> 07:45.797
- Hey, Emmett.
- How are you?

07:45.833 --> 07:47.132
Good.

07:47.167 --> 07:48.645
Sorry I'm late.
The budget meeting ran long.

07:48.669 --> 07:50.202
Don't even think about it.

07:50.237 --> 07:52.103
Look it, I made
a Kringlefest list.

07:52.139 --> 07:53.238
Here's what I think.

07:53.273 --> 07:55.607
I think that we should do
the Secret Santa selections

07:55.642 --> 07:57.209
before we do the tree lighting,

07:57.244 --> 07:58.710
and I've talked
to the potluck folks.

07:58.745 --> 07:59.644
They're starting
to cook already.

07:59.680 --> 08:02.047
Sounds good to me.

08:02.082 --> 08:03.793
You know, you really keep
a good handle on all of this.

08:03.817 --> 08:05.562
I can't believe
you still don't use a tablet.

08:05.586 --> 08:07.052
They really are handy.

08:08.489 --> 08:10.589
You know how Emmett is
with technology.

08:10.624 --> 08:11.656
Look, I just feel like

08:11.692 --> 08:13.391
there's something
more substantial

08:13.427 --> 08:14.427
about paper and pen.

08:15.662 --> 08:16.840
Can I get you something, Mayor?

08:16.864 --> 08:18.763
Sure.
I'll grab a coffee, thanks.

08:18.799 --> 08:19.631
Okay.

08:19.666 --> 08:21.600
Hey, do you have any of that...

08:21.635 --> 08:22.501
almond milk?

08:22.536 --> 08:24.236
I was talking to my niece
the other day

08:24.271 --> 08:25.582
and she says
it's so much better for you.

08:25.606 --> 08:26.950
I didn't know
you could milk an almond.

08:26.974 --> 08:28.618
Hayley, did you know
you could milk an almond?

08:28.642 --> 08:29.908
I had no idea.

08:29.943 --> 08:31.154
We didn't know that,
we don't have any...

08:31.178 --> 08:33.345
but next time,
we'll get you some.

08:33.380 --> 08:35.447
Okay, so besides
the tree lighting,

08:35.482 --> 08:36.448
what else is on the agenda?

08:36.482 --> 08:39.083
We have the same as always...

08:39.119 --> 08:40.952
the gingerbread contest,

08:40.988 --> 08:42.787
and caroling, of course...

08:42.823 --> 08:44.689
Actually, this year,

08:44.725 --> 08:46.135
we've got something
a little different.

08:46.159 --> 08:47.792
I've got a surprise
for Springdale.

08:47.828 --> 08:49.194
A special guest speaker.

08:49.229 --> 08:51.029
Well, I hope
it doesn't cost anything

08:51.064 --> 08:52.375
after what I heard
at the budget meeting today.

08:52.399 --> 08:53.865
Things are not looking good.

08:53.901 --> 08:55.311
Yeah, Steve said
that the hardware store

08:55.335 --> 08:56.701
hasn't been as busy either.

08:56.737 --> 08:57.981
Okay, well, hang on.
Don't be so gloomy, guys.

08:58.005 --> 08:59.804
It's not going to cost anything,

08:59.840 --> 09:01.806
and, in fact,
it might bring in some business.

09:01.842 --> 09:03.108
Okay? So, who's this...

09:03.143 --> 09:04.476
Nell Phillips.

09:04.511 --> 09:06.511
She's coming for a reading
and a book signing

09:06.547 --> 09:07.646
for Kringlefest.

09:07.681 --> 09:10.448
"Small Town Christmas"
is my favorite book right now.

09:11.852 --> 09:13.229
Wait, this is the one
we're doing for book club.

09:13.253 --> 09:14.719
That's right, Mayor.

09:14.755 --> 09:16.121
And funny thing, you know what,

09:16.156 --> 09:17.055
I actually...

09:17.090 --> 09:18.501
I used to work with her
in New York City.

09:18.525 --> 09:20.325
No kidding.
This is amazing!

09:20.360 --> 09:22.727
Well done, Emmett.

09:22.763 --> 09:23.795
Nell Phillips. Here!

09:23.830 --> 09:25.130
I mean, you must be thrilled.

09:26.934 --> 09:28.266
I'm... I'm... I am.

10:06.306 --> 10:08.173
Nell Phillips.
"Small Town Christmas".

10:10.410 --> 10:11.676
"Dedicated to my parents.

10:11.712 --> 10:16.014
Special thanks
to Caroline Shaw... "

10:16.049 --> 10:17.482
"Emmett".

10:33.834 --> 10:35.600
Good morning!

10:35.636 --> 10:37.068
Don't look so grim.

10:37.104 --> 10:38.970
It's just a quick trip.

10:39.006 --> 10:41.139
Are you sure
this is really necessary?

10:41.174 --> 10:42.474
Isn't the book
doing well enough?

10:42.509 --> 10:44.149
Yes, but we have to
keep up the momentum.

10:45.312 --> 10:46.444
Plus, seeing the town

10:46.480 --> 10:47.946
may give you
that extra inspiration

10:47.981 --> 10:49.225
for the sequel you're supposed
to be working on.

10:49.249 --> 10:51.049
I get inspiration
from everywhere.

10:51.084 --> 10:52.250
Do you really?

10:52.285 --> 10:53.118
Because you've given me

10:53.153 --> 10:56.121
a grand total
of zero pages so far.

10:56.156 --> 10:57.967
You know, I really think
that this trip will be helpful.

10:57.991 --> 11:00.158
Okay, I'm fine with the trip,

11:00.193 --> 11:02.260
but why does Emmett
have to be involved?

11:03.430 --> 11:05.096
Okay...

11:05.132 --> 11:06.564
what's this really about?

11:06.600 --> 11:09.100
It's just...

11:09.136 --> 11:11.436
Back when Emmett and I
used to work together,

11:11.471 --> 11:12.904
we had this connection.

11:14.608 --> 11:15.473
Or at least I thought we did.

11:15.509 --> 11:17.342
And then?

11:17.377 --> 11:18.176
And then, one night,

11:18.211 --> 11:20.412
we were supposed to meet
for dinner.

11:20.447 --> 11:23.081
He told me he had
this amazing night planned.

11:23.116 --> 11:23.882
We were celebrating

11:23.917 --> 11:25.617
because a story
we wrote together

11:25.652 --> 11:26.918
was moved into development.

11:26.953 --> 11:28.353
What happened?

11:28.388 --> 11:30.088
He didn't show up.

11:30.123 --> 11:32.791
I waited for two hours
in that restaurant,

11:32.826 --> 11:34.826
alone.

11:34.861 --> 11:38.263
He didn't call, he didn't text.

11:38.298 --> 11:40.265
Nothing.

11:40.300 --> 11:41.199
The next day,

11:41.234 --> 11:43.702
my boss told me
that he'd quit abruptly

11:43.737 --> 11:44.936
and packed up all his stuff.

11:46.306 --> 11:48.039
You didn't try to contact him?

11:48.075 --> 11:51.376
I sent him a few text messages.

11:51.411 --> 11:53.011
But he never responded.

11:53.046 --> 11:55.046
And that's it?

11:55.082 --> 11:57.315
He just disappeared.

11:57.350 --> 11:58.683
It was a sign to move on.

11:58.719 --> 11:59.551
A few years ago,

11:59.586 --> 12:01.352
I tried to look him up
on social media,

12:01.388 --> 12:02.388
but... nothing.

12:03.490 --> 12:04.556
End of story.

12:04.591 --> 12:06.524
You know you say that so much,

12:06.560 --> 12:08.071
they're gonna put it
on your tombstone.

12:08.095 --> 12:10.495
Here lies Nell Phillips,

12:10.530 --> 12:12.063
"End of Story".

12:12.099 --> 12:13.299
This time, it's true, though.

12:16.937 --> 12:18.870
He was the first guy
I really opened up to.

12:20.073 --> 12:22.273
About my parents...
and everything.

12:24.344 --> 12:26.224
And as soon as I opened up,
he shut it all down.

12:28.882 --> 12:30.515
I'm not going
to let that happen again.

12:32.285 --> 12:34.185
It sounds more like
"To be continued".

12:39.059 --> 12:39.924
"The sleepy town of Derryville

12:39.960 --> 12:42.327
roars to life
during the holiday season

12:42.362 --> 12:45.530
as if compelled by the magic
of Christmas itself".

12:45.565 --> 12:47.665
Of course, this book
is based on Springdale.

12:47.701 --> 12:50.168
No wonder
I love this book so much.

12:50.203 --> 12:52.048
She definitely
did this town justice.

12:52.072 --> 12:53.204
Sure did.

12:53.240 --> 12:54.884
You must be excited to see her
after all these years.

12:54.908 --> 12:55.908
I am.

12:55.942 --> 12:57.342
I'm not, you know,

12:57.377 --> 12:59.377
so sure she's going to be
excited to see me.

12:59.412 --> 13:00.912
Why? What happened?

13:00.947 --> 13:02.580
It was a long time ago.

13:03.984 --> 13:05.049
Come on, spill it.

13:06.887 --> 13:08.052
All right, all right.

13:08.088 --> 13:08.953
Well, we worked together.

13:08.989 --> 13:11.790
We'd gotten close, you know?

13:11.825 --> 13:14.092
So I had
this big dinner planned.

13:14.127 --> 13:15.527
It was kind of a first date.

13:16.730 --> 13:18.463
And then, you know,
everything happened,

13:18.498 --> 13:20.165
and I came back here.

13:23.003 --> 13:25.670
Which is the best decision
I ever made.

13:35.348 --> 13:36.759
So I just landed
in the middle of nowhere,

13:36.783 --> 13:38.650
in Wisconsin.

13:38.685 --> 13:40.785
This is the smallest airport
I've ever seen.

13:40.821 --> 13:42.086
<i>Well, buckle up,</i>

13:42.122 --> 13:44.455
<i>because you are still
a few hours from Springdale.</i>

13:44.491 --> 13:45.456
<i>It was too far away</i>

13:45.492 --> 13:47.091
for a car service,

13:47.127 --> 13:48.593
so I reserved you a rental.

13:48.628 --> 13:50.662
Perfect.

13:50.697 --> 13:51.529
<i>Call me when you get settled in.</i>

13:51.565 --> 13:54.065
I need to hear
how the reunion goes.

13:55.368 --> 13:56.913
And I will see you
back in New York for Christmas.

13:56.937 --> 13:59.137
I'll bring you some of
their famous ginger snaps.

13:59.172 --> 14:01.673
If they're as good
as you described in the book,

14:01.708 --> 14:02.974
bring a couple dozen.

14:03.009 --> 14:05.810
<i>And when you're not busy eating
award-winning baked goods,</i>

14:05.846 --> 14:07.612
<i>maybe get me some new pages?</i>

14:07.647 --> 14:08.947
Don't push your luck.

14:10.183 --> 14:11.183
<i>Okay. Bye.</i>

14:12.352 --> 14:13.151
Here are your keys.

14:13.186 --> 14:15.119
Do you need
any directions today?

14:15.155 --> 14:16.465
No thanks.
My phone should get me there.

14:16.489 --> 14:17.856
Okay, you're all set.

14:17.891 --> 14:19.123
Great.
Merry Christmas!

14:19.159 --> 14:20.225
Merry Christmas!

14:21.494 --> 14:22.527
Hi. I'm so sorry,

14:22.562 --> 14:23.361
I don't have a reservation,

14:23.396 --> 14:25.196
but I'll take
whatever you've got.

14:25.232 --> 14:27.265
I'm afraid
I just rented out the last one.

14:27.300 --> 14:28.533
Seriously?

14:28.568 --> 14:30.134
It's the holidays,
our busiest season.

14:31.204 --> 14:32.348
- Where are you off to?
- Springdale.

14:32.372 --> 14:34.172
The cabs won't go that far,

14:34.207 --> 14:35.073
but I can check
the bus schedule.

14:35.108 --> 14:36.608
Yeah, that would be great.
Thank you.

14:36.643 --> 14:39.477
The last bus to Springdale
already left.

14:39.512 --> 14:40.890
There's one
tomorrow afternoon, though.

14:40.914 --> 14:42.513
No, I really need
to get there tonight.

14:42.549 --> 14:44.360
I've got an important meeting
tomorrow morning.

14:44.384 --> 14:47.318
Is there anyone in town
that can maybe take me?

14:47.354 --> 14:48.820
I'll pay whatever it takes.

14:48.855 --> 14:51.356
Come on, Sandra.
It's... it's Christmas.

14:51.391 --> 14:52.290
I'm so sorry.
I don't...

14:52.325 --> 14:53.791
Excuse me.

14:53.827 --> 14:55.393
Sorry, I couldn't help
but overhear.

14:55.428 --> 14:56.694
I'm Nell.

14:56.730 --> 14:57.996
I'm Brad.

14:58.031 --> 15:00.198
I believe we're going
to the same place.

15:00.233 --> 15:01.065
I'd be happy
to share my rental car.

15:01.101 --> 15:02.166
Really?

15:02.202 --> 15:03.134
That... that would be amazing.

15:03.169 --> 15:04.747
Are you sure
you're comfortable with that?

15:04.771 --> 15:05.882
I mean, I can help cover
the cost, of course.

15:05.906 --> 15:07.739
That won't be necessary.

15:07.774 --> 15:09.574
But I will need your help
with directions?

15:09.609 --> 15:12.176
I would be honored
to be your navigator.

15:12.212 --> 15:13.077
Thank you so much.

15:13.113 --> 15:14.078
Thank you.

15:14.114 --> 15:15.079
May I?

15:15.115 --> 15:16.314
Thanks.

15:25.425 --> 15:27.325
Sorry, I had to fire off
a quick email.

15:27.360 --> 15:28.738
I'm helping a friend
with a new business plan.

15:28.762 --> 15:30.328
You're a finance guy?

15:30.363 --> 15:32.330
Guilty.

15:32.365 --> 15:33.998
I work for
a venture capital firm.

15:34.034 --> 15:35.767
That's actually
why I'm on this trip.

15:35.802 --> 15:37.702
I think I can put this town
on the map.

15:37.737 --> 15:40.038
I want to turn it into
a popular tourist destination.

15:40.073 --> 15:42.206
And you think
Springdale fits the bill?

15:42.242 --> 15:43.741
I know it does.

15:43.777 --> 15:46.210
I spent several Christmases
there when I was a kid.

15:46.246 --> 15:48.126
I still remember
all the fun holiday activities.

15:49.316 --> 15:50.559
So you've already experienced
a true Springdale Christmas.

15:50.583 --> 15:51.516
I have.

15:51.551 --> 15:52.551
I'm so jealous.

15:52.585 --> 15:54.552
I'm actually really excited
to be going again.

15:56.556 --> 15:57.355
Hi, Caroline.

15:57.390 --> 15:59.357
You're on speaker
and I'm not alone,

15:59.392 --> 16:01.759
so don't say anything
to embarrass me.

16:01.795 --> 16:02.860
<i>Okay.</i>

16:02.896 --> 16:04.896
I already sent you an email,

16:04.931 --> 16:07.231
but I wanted to give you
the head's up on your itinerary.

16:07.267 --> 16:09.067
<i>You have a book signing,</i>

16:09.102 --> 16:10.435
<i>then a local radio spot,</i>

16:10.470 --> 16:12.303
<i>and then book club.</i>

16:12.339 --> 16:13.304
<i>And last but not least,</i>

16:13.340 --> 16:15.373
I signed you up
for the gingerbread contest.

16:16.476 --> 16:18.543
Of course you did.

16:18.578 --> 16:19.922
And there'll be a photographer
there to cover everything.

16:19.946 --> 16:21.312
If you forget anything,

16:21.348 --> 16:22.391
Emmett's got
all the information.

16:22.415 --> 16:23.948
Emmett. Yes.

16:23.984 --> 16:25.283
Sounds good.

16:25.318 --> 16:26.284
<i>I'll call you later.</i>

16:26.319 --> 16:27.285
Okay. Have fun.

16:27.320 --> 16:28.252
<i>- Bye.
- Bye.</i>

16:28.288 --> 16:29.387
Whoa.

16:29.422 --> 16:30.422
I did not know

16:30.457 --> 16:32.557
I was in the presence
of a bona fide celebrity.

16:32.592 --> 16:33.658
Okay!

16:33.693 --> 16:35.560
Tell me about
this book of yours.

16:35.595 --> 16:36.595
Well, it's about

16:36.629 --> 16:37.662
a career-driven woman

16:37.697 --> 16:38.774
who gets stranded
in a small town

16:38.798 --> 16:40.331
over the holidays.

16:40.367 --> 16:43.101
And she may or may not
find love.

16:43.136 --> 16:44.402
Whoa! Don't leave me hanging.

16:44.437 --> 16:45.614
No, you have to buy the book
and read it.

16:45.638 --> 16:47.338
Okay. Done deal.
I'm in.

16:47.374 --> 16:50.174
So, this gingerbread contest...

16:50.210 --> 16:51.754
which I can tell
you're very excited about?

16:51.778 --> 16:52.778
Yeah.

16:52.812 --> 16:54.178
Do you need a partner?

16:54.214 --> 16:55.613
Only if you intend to win!

16:55.648 --> 16:56.614
I do.

16:56.649 --> 16:57.615
For sure.

16:57.650 --> 16:58.650
Okay.

17:02.655 --> 17:03.666
Looks like we're almost there.

17:03.690 --> 17:04.800
Okay, what are you
most excited about

17:04.824 --> 17:05.923
for your first Kringlefest?

17:07.160 --> 17:08.992
Whoa! What was that?

17:09.029 --> 17:09.761
That was a pothole.

17:09.796 --> 17:11.529
This town
has a whole lot of them.

17:11.564 --> 17:13.631
Looks like I need to add
street repairs to my list.

17:13.665 --> 17:16.267
Okay, so it looks like
we're coming up to my stop.

17:16.301 --> 17:18.202
Where do you want me
to drop you off?

17:18.238 --> 17:19.704
I'm at the Springdale Inn.

17:19.739 --> 17:22.205
Really?
That's where I'm staying.

17:22.242 --> 17:23.674
Don't be too surprised,
neighbor.

17:23.710 --> 17:25.443
It is the only hotel in town.

17:25.478 --> 17:26.778
Something else I intend to fix.

17:31.851 --> 17:33.131
Well, this is adorable.

17:36.222 --> 17:38.462
I'll just go ahead
and grab the bags real quick.

17:44.564 --> 17:46.864
- I'll drop them off inside.
- Yeah.

17:58.511 --> 17:59.511
Nell!

18:01.347 --> 18:02.713
Emmett.

18:04.584 --> 18:05.716
Hi.

18:05.752 --> 18:07.652
Hi, Nell.
Welcome to Springdale.

18:07.687 --> 18:10.021
I didn't know you were going
to be here when I arrived.

18:10.056 --> 18:11.389
I was just passing by.

18:11.424 --> 18:13.491
It's good to see you again.

18:13.526 --> 18:14.659
It's good to see you, too.

18:14.694 --> 18:15.871
You look exactly
like I remember.

18:15.895 --> 18:18.062
- You look good.
- Thank you.

18:18.098 --> 18:19.797
- So do you.
- Thanks.

18:19.833 --> 18:21.477
So what have you been...

18:21.501 --> 18:22.501
You go first.

18:22.535 --> 18:23.901
How was your trip?

18:23.937 --> 18:25.837
I'm shocked
that you're standing here.

18:25.872 --> 18:28.406
Well, it wasn't my idea.

18:28.441 --> 18:32.143
But it's great
to finally see Springdale.

18:32.178 --> 18:33.222
I should really thank you
for setting everything up.

18:33.246 --> 18:34.512
No, it was easy.

18:34.547 --> 18:35.580
It was no trouble at all.

18:35.615 --> 18:36.714
People are so impressed

18:36.749 --> 18:38.249
that I get to say
I knew you when.

18:38.284 --> 18:40.551
- That you did.
- Yeah.

18:40.587 --> 18:42.887
Hey, Nell, don't lock the...

18:42.922 --> 18:44.255
- Hey.
- Hi.

18:44.290 --> 18:45.156
How's it going?
I'm Brad Hathaway.

18:45.191 --> 18:46.324
Well, hi, Brad.

18:46.359 --> 18:47.391
I'm Emmett Turner.

18:47.427 --> 18:48.693
Right.
You own the book store.

18:48.728 --> 18:50.461
That? Yeah, I do. Yeah.

18:52.031 --> 18:52.997
I'm just going
to get my bag real quick.

18:53.032 --> 18:54.032
Yeah.

18:57.370 --> 18:58.269
Okay, well, what I want to do

18:58.304 --> 19:00.438
is give you the grand tour
of Springdale,

19:00.473 --> 19:01.405
but I'm sure you're beat,

19:01.441 --> 19:03.040
so get some sleep,

19:03.076 --> 19:05.343
and then in the morning,
if you have time, we'll do that.

19:05.378 --> 19:06.878
- Sure.
- Okay.

19:08.314 --> 19:10.081
I'll call the bookstore
when I'm ready.

19:10.116 --> 19:11.236
Great.
That's where I'll be.

19:13.419 --> 19:14.763
Brad! Great to meet you.
Welcome to Springdale.

19:14.787 --> 19:16.347
Nell, we're so excited
to have you here.

19:17.423 --> 19:19.223
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you, too.

19:27.667 --> 19:29.033
This place is beautiful.

19:29.068 --> 19:30.701
It's gorgeous.

19:30.737 --> 19:31.737
I hope they have wifi.

19:32.939 --> 19:34.338
I wonder where the host is.

19:35.842 --> 19:36.674
- Those are cute.
- Aren't they sweet?

19:36.709 --> 19:39.277
The local kids
make a new set each year

19:39.312 --> 19:40.422
and we display them
all over town.

19:40.446 --> 19:42.486
You know, I remember
making those when I was a kid.

19:43.349 --> 19:44.582
That's amazing.

19:44.617 --> 19:46.896
The only stockings I ever had
were from a department store.

19:46.920 --> 19:47.785
These have
so much more character.

19:47.820 --> 19:49.420
I'm Scott.

19:49.455 --> 19:50.388
You must be Ms. Phillips
and Mr. Hathaway?

19:50.423 --> 19:51.956
Yes.

19:51.991 --> 19:53.169
You're the last two guests
to arrive.

19:53.193 --> 19:54.559
Let me get the keys
to your rooms.

19:54.594 --> 19:55.594
Perfect.

19:58.198 --> 20:00.831
Hey, thank you again
for the ride.

20:00.867 --> 20:02.700
And I really enjoyed
the company.

20:03.770 --> 20:04.770
Of course.

20:05.872 --> 20:06.882
If you're not busy
tomorrow morning,

20:06.906 --> 20:08.117
you're more than welcome
to join me on the tour.

20:08.141 --> 20:09.985
I'd love to, but I actually
have a meeting with the mayor.

20:10.009 --> 20:12.243
But there's
a tree-lighting ceremony

20:12.278 --> 20:13.278
tomorrow night.

20:13.313 --> 20:14.378
Would you care to join me?

20:15.815 --> 20:17.515
I'd love to.

20:17.550 --> 20:19.417
- Great.
- Great.

20:23.723 --> 20:26.524
I can't believe that you're
here after all these years.

20:26.559 --> 20:28.459
Yeah, it's
funny it all worked out.

20:28.494 --> 20:30.361
Hey, do you keep in touch
with the old gang?

20:30.396 --> 20:32.129
I'd love to hear
how they're doing.

20:32.165 --> 20:33.442
A bunch of us got together
for Thanksgiving

20:33.466 --> 20:34.466
a few years ago,

20:34.500 --> 20:35.633
but it's been a while.

20:35.668 --> 20:38.469
Well, I should reach out
and wish them happy holidays.

20:38.504 --> 20:40.504
Seeing you will be
an excuse to re-connect.

20:40.540 --> 20:41.806
Sure. Good idea.

20:41.841 --> 20:42.807
All right.

20:42.842 --> 20:44.842
Well, here it is.

20:44.877 --> 20:45.810
This is the Main Street.

20:45.845 --> 20:46.956
This is where it all happens,
as they say.

20:46.980 --> 20:48.479
Now, this, right here,

20:48.514 --> 20:49.480
this is the Silver Moon Diner.

20:49.515 --> 20:50.381
If you're hungry for breakfast,

20:50.416 --> 20:52.550
it's the best
you're ever going to eat.

20:52.585 --> 20:54.363
Right across the street, we have
the original movie theatre

20:54.387 --> 20:55.786
built in 1949,

20:55.822 --> 20:57.222
and there,
at the end of the street,

20:57.257 --> 20:58.289
is PaigeTurner Books.

20:59.859 --> 21:01.259
That's my store.

21:02.562 --> 21:05.396
So you came back here
to open a store?

21:05.431 --> 21:07.632
It's been in the family
for years.

21:07.667 --> 21:08.987
I did start
the book club, though.

21:10.603 --> 21:11.914
Which is the last event
on my trip?

21:11.938 --> 21:13.537
Yep. Yep.

21:15.908 --> 21:17.174
I have to admit,

21:17.210 --> 21:18.988
I thought you were exaggerating
when you described this place.

21:19.012 --> 21:20.811
No. Not at all. No.

21:20.847 --> 21:21.857
There is no place in the world

21:21.881 --> 21:24.048
that celebrates Christmas
quite like Springdale.

21:24.083 --> 21:26.083
I saw
the kids' stockings earlier.

21:26.119 --> 21:27.084
So you really don't think

21:27.120 --> 21:28.880
that I'm going to need
that replacement part?

21:29.389 --> 21:31.589
Now, this is
Mrs. Ferguson and Steve.

21:31.624 --> 21:33.535
...Why that dishwasher just
suddenly started working again.

21:33.559 --> 21:35.026
Look, I promise you,

21:35.061 --> 21:36.705
you are not going to
run into another problem.

21:36.729 --> 21:38.162
Steve, if I find out

21:38.197 --> 21:39.575
that you came over there
and fixed it secretly

21:39.599 --> 21:40.865
without sending me a bill...

21:40.900 --> 21:42.266
All right, hold on a second.

21:42.302 --> 21:43.134
Before you get too mad at him,

21:43.169 --> 21:44.649
you know
he can't help himself, right?

21:45.872 --> 21:46.904
Hi!

21:46.939 --> 21:48.372
Who's your friend?

21:48.408 --> 21:49.373
Nell Phillips,

21:49.409 --> 21:50.775
this is Mrs. Ferguson.

21:50.810 --> 21:51.709
Now, don't tell Mayor Deakins,

21:51.744 --> 21:53.411
but Mrs. Ferguson

21:53.446 --> 21:55.346
is the one who actually
runs things around here.

21:55.381 --> 21:57.248
And this is Steve.
He runs the hardware store.

21:57.283 --> 21:59.283
It's a pleasure to meet you,
Mrs. Ferguson. Steve.

21:59.319 --> 22:01.218
The pleasure is mine.

22:01.254 --> 22:04.255
Our book club is going to be
very happy to meet you.

22:04.290 --> 22:05.589
If you have the time,

22:05.625 --> 22:07.224
please, drop over for tea.

22:07.260 --> 22:08.993
If I can, it would be an honor.

22:10.496 --> 22:12.641
All right, I'm going to take
Nell to go see the bookstore.

22:12.665 --> 22:13.931
All right.

22:13.966 --> 22:15.466
- See you later.
- Bye-bye.

22:15.501 --> 22:16.545
That means you're probably

22:16.569 --> 22:17.613
going to run into
my wife, Hayley,

22:17.637 --> 22:19.403
and fair warning...

22:19.439 --> 22:21.372
she's gonna ask you
a whole lot of questions.

22:21.407 --> 22:22.873
I'll prepare myself.

22:22.909 --> 22:24.008
Seriously.

22:25.411 --> 22:26.677
- Bye, Steve.
- See ya.

22:28.281 --> 22:31.282
You know, I want to say
how much I enjoyed your book,

22:31.317 --> 22:34.085
I mean, how much everybody
has enjoyed your book.

22:34.120 --> 22:36.053
You took a few snippets
of this town

22:36.089 --> 22:36.987
that I told you,

22:37.023 --> 22:38.434
and you created something
really wonderful.

22:38.458 --> 22:39.458
I'm proud of you.

22:40.460 --> 22:41.892
Well, thank you.

22:41.928 --> 22:43.828
And, you know,
I saw you put my name there

22:43.863 --> 22:44.729
in the special acknowledgements.

22:44.764 --> 22:45.908
That was...
you didn't have to do that.

22:45.932 --> 22:46.764
I was flattered.

22:46.799 --> 22:48.432
It's customary
to thank the people

22:48.468 --> 22:51.001
that provided inspiration
or feedback on a work.

22:51.037 --> 22:52.037
It's pretty standard.

22:54.307 --> 22:56.340
Well...

22:56.376 --> 22:58.776
other than writing
a best-selling novel,

22:58.811 --> 23:01.645
what have you been doing
these past six years?

23:01.681 --> 23:02.681
Mostly working.

23:02.715 --> 23:04.448
After a few dead ends,

23:04.484 --> 23:06.161
someone finally responded
to "Small Town Christmas,"

23:06.185 --> 23:07.151
and, well...

23:07.186 --> 23:08.586
End of story.

23:08.621 --> 23:09.987
Yeah.

23:11.190 --> 23:12.190
We're here.

23:13.226 --> 23:14.226
You ready?

23:18.398 --> 23:19.541
Mayor Deakins, thank you so much

23:19.565 --> 23:20.642
for agreeing to meet with me.

23:20.666 --> 23:21.766
I have to say,

23:21.801 --> 23:22.945
I was very intrigued
by your email.

23:22.969 --> 23:26.337
Tell me more about this
revitalization idea of yours.

23:26.372 --> 23:27.772
It's very simple.

23:27.807 --> 23:29.807
I plan to fund
upgraded infrastructure,

23:29.842 --> 23:30.886
technology,
and building improvements.

23:30.910 --> 23:33.711
Now, I also want to purchase
existing buildings,

23:33.746 --> 23:35.880
some to fix up,
and others to re-purpose.

23:35.915 --> 23:37.548
Now, you honestly believe

23:37.583 --> 23:40.351
you can transform Springdale
into a viable vacation spot?

23:40.386 --> 23:41.952
Kringlefest and Springdale

23:41.988 --> 23:43.621
is absolutely

23:43.656 --> 23:45.356
the world's best-kept
holiday secret.

23:45.391 --> 23:46.891
But it's not going to be long

23:46.926 --> 23:49.226
until the whole world
is knocking at your door.

23:49.262 --> 23:50.561
This place,

23:50.596 --> 23:52.196
it has potential
for huge success,

23:52.231 --> 23:53.364
so as long as you can handle

23:53.399 --> 23:56.033
the number of tourists
that are sure to come your way.

23:56.068 --> 23:57.101
That's where I come in.

23:57.136 --> 24:01.806
These are some of the plans
that I have in mind.

24:05.745 --> 24:07.178
Here it is.

24:15.388 --> 24:16.698
You couldn't have just
stuck with the basics, huh?

24:16.722 --> 24:18.222
Fiction.

24:18.257 --> 24:19.223
Non-fiction.

24:19.258 --> 24:22.193
I think that
it's a very successful system.

24:22.228 --> 24:23.705
It was one of the innovations
I implemented

24:23.729 --> 24:24.862
when I took this place over.

24:26.132 --> 24:27.372
Well, it's the only innovation.

24:30.536 --> 24:31.613
I just hope my book
doesn't end up

24:31.637 --> 24:32.970
with the "One Hit Wonders".

24:35.575 --> 24:36.507
Highly unlikely.

24:36.542 --> 24:38.342
In fact,

24:38.377 --> 24:39.621
I created a section
especially for you.

24:39.645 --> 24:40.711
Come here.

24:44.083 --> 24:45.749
Where is it?

24:45.785 --> 24:47.685
Here, here.

24:47.720 --> 24:50.221
"Heartfelt Christmas
with a Strong Female Heroine".

24:51.657 --> 24:52.690
Okay.

24:52.725 --> 24:53.836
Looks like I should
get cracking on that sequel.

24:53.860 --> 24:58.128
And I wanted you to have
a proper Springdale welcome

24:58.164 --> 25:00.030
with an absurdly large sign.

25:01.100 --> 25:03.300
Well...

25:03.336 --> 25:05.236
Emmett, this store
is incredible,

25:05.271 --> 25:07.271
but are you still writing?

25:07.306 --> 25:08.873
- Well...
- Hey, boss!

25:08.908 --> 25:10.608
I didn't know
you were coming in.

25:10.643 --> 25:11.609
Ms. Phillips!

25:11.644 --> 25:14.378
Nell, this is Hayley,
my favorite employee.

25:14.413 --> 25:16.814
His only employee,
but I'll take it. Hi.

25:16.849 --> 25:19.250
Hi, Hayley,
very nice to meet you.

25:19.285 --> 25:20.462
We ran into your husband
earlier today,

25:20.486 --> 25:21.418
and, please, call me Nell.

25:21.454 --> 25:22.987
Okay, thank you!

25:23.022 --> 25:23.888
Springdale?

25:23.923 --> 25:25.100
Is it everything
you thought it would be

25:25.124 --> 25:26.724
or is it totally different?

25:26.759 --> 25:27.591
And do you have a big agenda
while you're in town?

25:27.627 --> 25:28.737
Can I get you a coffee
or something?

25:28.761 --> 25:29.927
You were warned.

25:31.464 --> 25:32.830
It's been incredible so far.

25:32.865 --> 25:33.764
Even better than I imagined.

25:33.799 --> 25:36.066
Just a few official stops
for the book tour

25:36.102 --> 25:37.801
and then
it's back home to New York.

25:39.005 --> 25:40.771
And, yes,
a coffee sounds perfect.

25:40.806 --> 25:42.573
Yes! Okay!

25:42.608 --> 25:43.641
I've...

25:43.676 --> 25:46.310
I've always wanted
to travel and visit New York.

25:46.345 --> 25:48.646
It just seems so exciting,

25:48.681 --> 25:50.948
but I haven't really
ever made it out of state.

25:52.151 --> 25:54.618
Well, I've always wanted
to visit Springdale.

25:54.654 --> 25:55.831
Maybe you can tell me
some more stories.

25:55.855 --> 25:57.922
I need some fodder
for the sequel.

25:57.957 --> 25:59.877
You might be able to help
with my writer's block.

26:00.860 --> 26:02.526
I'm sorry, I just...

26:02.562 --> 26:03.427
I can't believe that Emmett

26:03.462 --> 26:06.931
is friends with
a best-selling author.

26:08.167 --> 26:08.999
Acquaintances, really,

26:09.035 --> 26:11.001
but, yeah, we go way back.

26:13.472 --> 26:14.472
One sugar, no cream.

26:16.375 --> 26:17.455
- Thanks. Thank you.
- Yeah.

26:20.413 --> 26:23.447
Well, I should get back.

26:23.482 --> 26:24.802
I've got some work
to catch up on.

26:26.185 --> 26:28.152
But I'll see you tonight?

26:28.187 --> 26:30.120
Yes, you will.

26:30.156 --> 26:32.957
- Very nice to meet you, Hayley.
- Thank you.

26:32.992 --> 26:34.158
Bye-bye.

26:36.662 --> 26:37.662
She's great!

26:37.697 --> 26:39.196
Yeah.

27:37.790 --> 27:38.790
How are they selling?

27:38.824 --> 27:40.991
Oh, my goodness,
they're selling like hotcakes.

27:41.027 --> 27:42.960
I'm moving her
to the prime spot.

27:42.995 --> 27:44.461
Where's Marnie?

27:44.497 --> 27:46.008
I was going to take her
to the ice rink.

27:46.032 --> 27:47.598
Hayley took her
Christmas shopping.

27:47.633 --> 27:48.532
You know, I don't know

27:48.567 --> 27:49.611
what I would do
without you two ladies.

27:49.635 --> 27:50.934
I appreciate you.

27:50.970 --> 27:52.581
You know we'd do anything
for that girl.

27:52.605 --> 27:53.837
I know.

27:53.873 --> 27:56.607
Hey, what was it like
seeing Nell again.

27:56.642 --> 27:58.075
I don't know.

27:58.110 --> 27:59.743
It was different.

27:59.779 --> 28:01.812
You know, she...

28:01.847 --> 28:03.325
She used to have
more of a sense of humor.

28:03.349 --> 28:05.015
Maybe she's just shy

28:05.051 --> 28:06.628
because you haven't
seen each other in so long.

28:06.652 --> 28:07.685
Could be.

28:07.720 --> 28:09.364
But she completely ignored
the letter I sent her.

28:09.388 --> 28:12.256
Letter?

28:12.291 --> 28:13.611
Like an actual letter
in the mail?

28:14.527 --> 28:15.527
Why didn't you call her?

28:17.797 --> 28:18.662
I don't know.

28:18.698 --> 28:20.042
You know how hard it was
for me back then.

28:20.066 --> 28:21.665
I didn't know what to say.

28:21.701 --> 28:22.966
She texted me a few times,

28:23.002 --> 28:24.435
but...

28:24.470 --> 28:25.981
I should have responded,
but I ignored her,

28:26.005 --> 28:27.137
and...

28:28.174 --> 28:31.175
- You were overwhelmed.
- Yeah.

28:31.210 --> 28:32.076
I wanted to focus on Marnie

28:32.111 --> 28:33.777
and I wanted
to make sure she was okay.

28:33.813 --> 28:35.533
I still don't get
how this letter fits in.

28:36.682 --> 28:39.116
Okay, I wrote her a letter
months after.

28:39.151 --> 28:41.819
I just wanted to apologize
and tell her about Paige,

28:41.854 --> 28:43.954
and I wanted to put
all my thoughts down at once,

28:43.989 --> 28:44.788
and then I mailed it

28:44.824 --> 28:47.357
to the office
we used to work at.

28:47.393 --> 28:48.393
- She didn't reply?
- No.

28:48.427 --> 28:50.494
No, and I guess she's moved on
and that's fine.

28:51.764 --> 28:52.730
Emm, I'm sorry.

28:52.765 --> 28:53.765
That's okay, you know?

28:55.901 --> 28:57.367
I guess she's just...

28:57.403 --> 28:58.902
from a different time
in my life.

28:58.938 --> 29:01.371
But when I heard
she was coming back here,

29:01.407 --> 29:02.206
I got my hopes up.

29:02.241 --> 29:04.041
I thought
maybe we could be friends.

29:04.076 --> 29:05.342
I've missed her.

29:21.026 --> 29:22.704
So I know I'm supposed to be
working on the sequel,

29:22.728 --> 29:25.095
but I just ran into
the coolest toy store.

29:25.131 --> 29:26.141
What are your kids into
these days?

29:26.165 --> 29:28.332
They will be fine
with whatever you pick out.

29:28.367 --> 29:29.333
Now stop deflecting

29:29.368 --> 29:31.101
and tell me how it went
seeing Emmett again.

29:31.137 --> 29:33.670
I am not deflecting!

29:33.706 --> 29:34.838
Emmett's fine.

29:34.874 --> 29:36.218
He knows all the details
for my trip.

29:36.242 --> 29:38.442
But did you ask him
about standing you up?

29:38.477 --> 29:39.888
He's acting like
it never happened,

29:39.912 --> 29:41.612
so I am, too.

29:41.647 --> 29:43.024
You're seriously
not going to mention anything?

29:43.048 --> 29:45.516
I seriously don't see the point.

29:45.551 --> 29:46.862
Obviously,
the time we spent together

29:46.886 --> 29:48.352
meant more to me
than it did to him.

29:50.055 --> 29:51.233
I'll call you
after the book signing

29:51.257 --> 29:52.367
and let you know how it goes.

29:52.391 --> 29:53.657
<i>- Bye!
- Bye.</i>

29:58.230 --> 30:00.197
I'm so sorry!

30:00.232 --> 30:02.032
That's okay.
You can't break the stuffing.

30:02.067 --> 30:03.433
That's true.

30:03.469 --> 30:04.535
I'm Marnie.

30:04.570 --> 30:05.669
I'm Nell.

30:05.704 --> 30:07.783
Are you the one who wrote
the book about Springdale?

30:07.807 --> 30:08.605
That's me.

30:08.641 --> 30:09.684
It's very nice
to meet you, Marnie.

30:09.708 --> 30:12.476
I'm going to read it
while I'm on winter break.

30:12.511 --> 30:14.611
I can do a book report on it
if you want!

30:14.647 --> 30:16.079
That's so sweet!

30:16.115 --> 30:17.115
Like for school?

30:17.149 --> 30:18.816
Just for practice.

30:18.851 --> 30:20.050
What are you practicing for?

30:20.085 --> 30:21.885
College.

30:21.921 --> 30:22.853
College?

30:22.888 --> 30:26.223
Marnie, I just found
the cutest little...

30:26.258 --> 30:27.491
Hi! Nell! Hi!

30:27.526 --> 30:29.226
Hi, Hayley.

30:29.261 --> 30:30.427
Is she yours?

30:30.462 --> 30:33.096
Oh, no, I'm just watching
this little cutie for Emmett.

30:33.132 --> 30:34.398
Emmett?

30:34.433 --> 30:36.466
Okay.

30:36.502 --> 30:38.202
But it is good practice for me.

30:39.805 --> 30:40.805
I'm sure.

30:42.041 --> 30:43.185
Are we going to see you
at the tree lighting?

30:43.209 --> 30:45.676
Yeah! That's tonight!

30:45.711 --> 30:47.110
I almost forgot about that.

30:47.146 --> 30:49.580
Thank you for reminding me.

30:49.615 --> 30:50.826
I'm just on my way
back to the hotel

30:50.850 --> 30:52.683
to bundle up.

30:52.718 --> 30:54.451
Okay. Well, we will
see you there, then.

30:54.486 --> 30:55.486
See you there!

30:55.521 --> 30:56.561
Race you to the register.

30:59.024 --> 31:00.390
Bye.

31:09.301 --> 31:11.501
I just saw the stage
that you built, Steve.

31:11.537 --> 31:12.870
Amazing job, as always.

31:12.905 --> 31:15.072
Thank you.
I do what I can, you know?

31:16.242 --> 31:17.507
Nell!

31:19.245 --> 31:20.322
Hope you're enjoying Springdale!

31:20.346 --> 31:21.445
Thanks, Steve.

31:22.514 --> 31:23.547
Hiya, Nell.

31:23.582 --> 31:24.948
Well, you're certainly getting

31:24.984 --> 31:26.984
an insider's peek
behind the scenes, huh?

31:27.019 --> 31:29.319
I sure am.

31:29.355 --> 31:31.066
It seems like you have
a very fulfilled life here.

31:31.090 --> 31:32.823
Yeah, well, it's not perfect,

31:32.858 --> 31:35.158
but I wouldn't trade it
for anything.

31:37.229 --> 31:38.562
You're very lucky

31:38.597 --> 31:40.430
you spent your childhood
in a place like this.

31:42.701 --> 31:44.045
My parents
never slowed down long enough

31:44.069 --> 31:45.702
to celebrate our own traditions,

31:45.738 --> 31:47.371
and after my mom passed,

31:47.406 --> 31:48.972
we started celebrating
even less.

31:49.008 --> 31:51.341
I'm sorry.

31:51.377 --> 31:52.309
I remember you telling me

31:52.344 --> 31:55.479
how your dad passed away
shortly after that,

31:55.514 --> 31:56.947
so Christmases
must be hard for you.

31:58.684 --> 31:59.783
I think that's why

31:59.818 --> 32:03.220
your Christmas stories
stood out the most in my mind.

32:03.255 --> 32:04.321
And I'm surprised

32:04.356 --> 32:05.756
you remember that
about my parents.

32:05.791 --> 32:07.357
I remember everything about you.

32:07.393 --> 32:09.159
About us.
Our time together.

32:13.532 --> 32:15.098
Here's what I do know.

32:15.134 --> 32:16.945
I know that your mom and dad
would be very proud of you,

32:16.969 --> 32:18.835
and...

32:18.871 --> 32:20.071
all the success you're having.

32:21.707 --> 32:22.906
I know I am.

32:25.577 --> 32:27.244
Hey, are you going to join us

32:27.279 --> 32:29.880
for the Christmas tree
lighting tonight?

32:29.915 --> 32:31.348
Yeah.

32:31.383 --> 32:32.716
I should get going,

32:32.751 --> 32:33.862
'cause I told Brad
I would meet him before.

32:33.886 --> 32:35.018
Brad?

32:36.789 --> 32:37.754
Right, Brad.

32:37.790 --> 32:40.257
How... how is Brad?

32:40.292 --> 32:41.224
He's good.

32:41.260 --> 32:42.292
Yeah?

32:42.328 --> 32:43.328
Yeah, he's a nice guy.

32:44.930 --> 32:46.063
- See you there.
- Bye now.

32:48.734 --> 32:50.167
Brad...

33:13.859 --> 33:15.225
So...

33:15.260 --> 33:17.627
how are you liking
Springdale so far?

33:17.663 --> 33:21.631
It's surreal being here
after picturing it for so long.

33:21.667 --> 33:22.933
It's magical.

33:22.968 --> 33:24.401
It's so unique.

33:24.436 --> 33:25.436
I know.

33:25.471 --> 33:27.938
And I don't want to interfere
with any of that.

33:27.973 --> 33:29.406
I just...

33:29.441 --> 33:31.401
I just want to spruce things
up a bit, that's all.

33:32.344 --> 33:33.176
Being here makes me want

33:33.212 --> 33:34.612
to start my own
Christmas tradition.

33:35.714 --> 33:36.847
Who knows?

33:36.882 --> 33:38.482
We could be starting one
right now.

33:40.019 --> 33:41.585
Watch out for that ice.

33:41.620 --> 33:43.660
We can't have the guest of honor
showing up injured!

33:45.157 --> 33:46.857
You look terrific, by the way.

33:46.892 --> 33:47.892
Thank you.

33:50.396 --> 33:52.462
Hi! Welcome to Kringlefest.

33:52.498 --> 33:55.866
Hey, so how does this stage
compare to other venues?

33:55.901 --> 33:58.268
Well, I've never had a stage
quite like this.

33:58.303 --> 34:00.137
Springdale might not be
a big town,

34:00.172 --> 34:01.805
but we make up for it
with enthusiasm.

34:04.343 --> 34:05.854
I'm sorry, I've got to take
this call real quick.

34:05.878 --> 34:07.177
I'll be right back.

34:07.212 --> 34:08.478
- Okay.
- Hello?

34:08.514 --> 34:10.047
So I hope it's okay

34:10.081 --> 34:11.681
I cleared off
a little space right here

34:11.717 --> 34:12.860
for the reporter
to take pictures of you.

34:12.885 --> 34:13.850
If that's all right?

34:13.886 --> 34:16.319
Well, thank you, Emmett.

34:16.355 --> 34:17.355
That's very thoughtful.

34:17.389 --> 34:18.554
Happy Secret Santa night!

34:18.590 --> 34:19.723
Happy what?

34:19.757 --> 34:21.069
It's the night
we all draw names,

34:21.092 --> 34:22.292
the start of Kringlefest.

34:22.327 --> 34:23.693
How do you know Nell?

34:23.728 --> 34:25.695
Marnie and I met
at the toy shop today.

34:25.731 --> 34:26.797
We go way back.

34:28.266 --> 34:29.199
So how does it work?

34:29.234 --> 34:31.568
You pull a secret name
out of Santa's bag

34:31.603 --> 34:33.536
and we all exchange gifts
on Christmas Eve.

34:33.572 --> 34:34.371
You have to do it!

34:34.406 --> 34:36.672
I'll be back
in New York by then.

34:36.708 --> 34:39.309
You could mail it.
That'd be super secret.

34:39.344 --> 34:41.545
I'll feel bad, I'm not a local.

34:41.580 --> 34:43.547
Come on, it's so much fun!

34:43.581 --> 34:44.915
You know, it's pointless.

34:44.949 --> 34:46.616
You don't really want
to argue with her.

34:48.020 --> 34:49.186
Well, okay. Why not?

34:49.221 --> 34:50.221
And then tomorrow,

34:50.255 --> 34:51.933
you can come over and decorate
our tree with us!

34:51.956 --> 34:54.757
All right, hold on.
Slow down, Pumpkin.

34:54.793 --> 34:57.360
She's got a full plate tomorrow.

34:57.396 --> 34:59.362
She's got a big, important
radio interview.

34:59.398 --> 35:01.264
Okay, that big, important
radio interview's

35:01.300 --> 35:02.899
only going to take an hour,

35:02.935 --> 35:04.245
but I don't want to impose
on your family time.

35:04.269 --> 35:05.202
No, no, it's not an imposition.

35:05.237 --> 35:06.603
You want to come,

35:06.638 --> 35:08.438
we would love to have you
if you want to come.

35:09.541 --> 35:11.007
Okay! I'll take that
as a yes. Bye!

35:12.277 --> 35:13.910
- Jenny!
- See?

35:13.946 --> 35:15.011
What did I tell you?

35:15.047 --> 35:16.091
I told you
she's hard to say no to.

35:16.115 --> 35:16.913
Did she get that from you

35:16.949 --> 35:19.049
or did she get that
from her mother?

35:19.084 --> 35:20.050
Paige.

35:20.085 --> 35:21.885
Paige?

35:21.920 --> 35:22.786
Like your sister, Paige?

35:22.821 --> 35:23.821
Yeah.

35:25.157 --> 35:26.367
Wait, so Marnie's
not your daughter?

35:26.391 --> 35:27.724
No, no.

35:27.759 --> 35:31.428
Marnie is my wonderful,
precocious, fiery niece.

35:31.463 --> 35:32.863
I thought we talked about that.

35:32.898 --> 35:34.197
Yeah...

35:35.601 --> 35:37.434
Yeah, I guess,
but that was a long time ago.

35:37.469 --> 35:38.368
I mean, it's been years.

35:38.403 --> 35:39.269
Well, sure.

35:39.304 --> 35:40.537
So where are her parents?

35:43.909 --> 35:45.086
Her mom and dad
died in a car accident

35:45.110 --> 35:46.110
when she was 3.

35:46.145 --> 35:48.879
I took custody right away.

35:50.983 --> 35:52.727
- I wrote all that in...
- Come on, Uncle Emmett!

35:52.751 --> 35:54.084
I want to see the tree up close!

35:57.589 --> 35:59.856
That's why you left.

36:09.301 --> 36:11.101
Hey, what did I miss?

36:11.136 --> 36:12.102
Nothing.

36:12.137 --> 36:13.681
Just about to pick out
my Secret Santa name.

36:13.705 --> 36:15.150
You're really getting into this.

36:15.174 --> 36:17.607
Okay...

36:20.179 --> 36:22.979
All right, everyone,
let's gather around.

36:23.015 --> 36:24.481
We're about to begin.

36:24.516 --> 36:25.549
Come on up.

36:25.584 --> 36:29.619
Grab yourselves
some hot chocolate and a treat.

36:29.655 --> 36:31.321
Get some hot cider.

36:31.356 --> 36:33.323
Welcome, everyone,

36:33.358 --> 36:34.758
to the start
of another Kringlefest.

36:36.995 --> 36:39.529
Now, before I call upon
our special guest,

36:39.565 --> 36:40.645
I have a few brief remarks.

36:41.833 --> 36:43.733
If everything
goes as intended this week,

36:43.769 --> 36:46.736
Springdale will be receiving

36:46.772 --> 36:48.838
a much-appreciated
and much-needed

36:48.874 --> 36:50.740
infusion of capital

36:50.776 --> 36:52.542
from Brad Hathaway
and his investment group.

36:53.712 --> 36:55.879
As a token of their support,

36:55.914 --> 36:57.180
they have arranged

36:57.216 --> 36:59.716
to have this year's
Christmas Eve potluck

36:59.751 --> 37:00.617
professionally catered.

37:00.652 --> 37:02.686
So you can all put away
your Crock-Pots!

37:02.721 --> 37:05.021
By this time next year,

37:05.057 --> 37:08.959
we'll be hosting
a brand-new holiday festival.

37:11.463 --> 37:12.929
All we're aiming to do

37:12.965 --> 37:15.065
is enhance
our beloved traditions

37:15.100 --> 37:16.199
and look toward the future.

37:17.302 --> 37:20.103
Now, we've instituted
some recommended guidelines

37:20.138 --> 37:22.272
for next year's
storefront decorations.

37:22.307 --> 37:23.618
You can't just change tradition.

37:23.642 --> 37:25.008
That's why
it's called "tradition"!

37:27.246 --> 37:28.612
Okay...

37:28.647 --> 37:30.380
Everyone, just
bear with me, please.

37:31.650 --> 37:33.116
Everybody, calm down.

37:33.151 --> 37:34.918
Calm down.
Calm down, everybody.

37:34.953 --> 37:35.685
Let's just listen

37:35.721 --> 37:37.787
to what next year's plans
might be

37:37.823 --> 37:38.866
before we lodge complaints.

37:38.890 --> 37:41.224
Isn't that fair?

37:41.260 --> 37:43.126
We're here to light
a Christmas tree tonight.

37:43.161 --> 37:44.127
We're here to celebrate

37:44.162 --> 37:46.229
and welcome our special guest
to Springdale.

37:46.265 --> 37:47.931
In fact,

37:47.966 --> 37:49.933
why don't we let
our special guest

37:49.968 --> 37:51.635
light the Christmas tree
this year?

37:51.670 --> 37:54.804
Everybody, please give
author Nell Phillips

37:54.840 --> 37:56.072
a warm Springdale welcome!

37:59.745 --> 38:01.244
You're going to flip a switch.

38:02.681 --> 38:04.559
I've never done anything
like this before, but...

38:04.583 --> 38:07.917
here's to Kringlefest,
past, present and future!

38:07.953 --> 38:09.452
Ready?

38:09.488 --> 38:13.256
Three, two, one...

38:25.537 --> 38:27.637
Thank you for that, by the way.

38:27.673 --> 38:30.407
I think that everyone's going
to love my plan for Springdale

38:30.442 --> 38:32.108
once they just see
my vision for it.

38:32.144 --> 38:33.109
It's going to be great.

38:33.145 --> 38:34.411
I hope so, Brad.

38:34.446 --> 38:35.545
Let me ask you this,

38:35.580 --> 38:37.292
have you ever thought
about selling your bookstore?

38:37.316 --> 38:39.949
Because, from what I've heard,

38:39.985 --> 38:42.452
you should be writing books,
not selling them.

38:42.487 --> 38:43.753
I've never...

38:43.789 --> 38:44.754
Just think about it.

38:44.790 --> 38:46.222
I'll think about it.

38:47.326 --> 38:49.092
All right, everybody.

38:49.127 --> 38:52.529
Nell is going to read
a small excerpt

38:52.564 --> 38:54.709
from her new best-selling book,
"Small Town Christmas,"

38:54.733 --> 38:56.099
and then when she's done,

38:56.134 --> 38:57.654
if you want her to,
she'll sign a copy.

39:03.041 --> 39:05.175
"One break-up had been enough.

39:05.210 --> 39:07.121
Amanda had locked her heart
and thrown away the key,

39:07.145 --> 39:09.813
but as she connected
to Derryville

39:09.848 --> 39:11.948
and the people within it,

39:11.983 --> 39:14.984
it was if the town itself
was slowly picking the lock.

39:17.055 --> 39:17.854
When she imagined

39:17.889 --> 39:19.356
what kind of man
could win her heart,

39:19.391 --> 39:21.291
she always thought of him...

39:21.326 --> 39:22.326
the one that got away.

39:23.829 --> 39:26.296
The one no one
had ever measured up to...

39:26.331 --> 39:27.697
or ever could".

39:34.773 --> 39:35.939
Thank you so much.

39:37.909 --> 39:39.976
The entire town is in this line.

39:40.011 --> 39:41.356
Do you want me to help you
make a break for it?

39:41.380 --> 39:42.380
I'm okay.

39:42.414 --> 39:45.248
I want to meet everyone
who wants to meet me.

39:45.283 --> 39:46.616
- Hi.
- You're the boss.

39:48.220 --> 39:49.886
Hey, kiddo.

39:49.921 --> 39:51.388
Are you getting sleepy?

39:51.423 --> 39:53.323
No. I want to stay
till the end.

39:53.358 --> 39:55.558
Well, I think
we've reached the end, baby.

39:55.594 --> 39:57.494
Let's get you home to sleep.
Come on.

39:58.697 --> 40:00.864
Shouldn't we say goodbye
to Nell first?

40:00.899 --> 40:03.066
No. She'll understand.

40:03.101 --> 40:04.601
Plus, we'll see Nell tomorrow.

40:04.636 --> 40:06.169
Come on, let's get you to sleep.

40:13.879 --> 40:15.044
Merry Christmas.

40:18.917 --> 40:20.683
Hi.

40:21.953 --> 40:24.387
Tuck Lady Bunnington in.

40:24.423 --> 40:26.089
All right, goodnight, kiddo.

40:27.259 --> 40:28.658
One more story before bed?

40:30.262 --> 40:31.639
Okay. Which one
do you want me to read?

40:31.663 --> 40:33.703
Not one of those.
I want an Uncle Emmett original.

40:35.133 --> 40:37.167
All right. Okay.
All right. All right.

40:38.937 --> 40:40.537
Once upon a time,

40:40.572 --> 40:42.939
a long, long time ago,

40:42.974 --> 40:47.243
there was a little girl
who could yawn for hours

40:47.279 --> 40:48.445
and never fall asleep.

40:50.415 --> 40:51.748
But one day,

40:51.783 --> 40:55.385
this little girl met a rabbit.

40:56.822 --> 40:58.332
And that's why
he had to move so suddenly.

40:58.356 --> 41:00.223
I just wish
he would have told me sooner.

41:00.258 --> 41:02.091
I could have
done something to help.

41:02.127 --> 41:03.326
<i>He walked away</i>

41:03.361 --> 41:04.928
from his entire life

41:04.963 --> 41:05.862
to take care of his niece.

41:05.897 --> 41:08.264
<i>He sounds like an amazing guy.</i>

41:08.300 --> 41:09.911
<i>No wonder you've been
pining after him all this time.</i>

41:09.935 --> 41:11.401
Pining?

41:11.436 --> 41:12.502
Who said I was pining?

41:12.537 --> 41:15.171
Anyway, it doesn't matter.

41:15.207 --> 41:16.606
He's focused on his niece
right now

41:16.641 --> 41:17.752
and he doesn't see me
the way he used to.

41:17.776 --> 41:18.776
End of story.

41:18.810 --> 41:20.510
Okay, fair enough.

41:20.545 --> 41:22.345
So... tell me about
this Brad guy.

41:22.380 --> 41:26.416
Well, he's successful and witty.

41:26.451 --> 41:29.118
He's very passionate
about his job,

41:29.154 --> 41:31.421
He really helped me out
last night at the book signing,

41:31.456 --> 41:32.322
which was sweet.

41:32.357 --> 41:34.290
You sound like
you have some options.

41:34.326 --> 41:35.492
Okay.

41:35.527 --> 41:36.459
Well, I have to get going,

41:36.495 --> 41:38.194
because my publisher booked
an appearance

41:38.230 --> 41:40.330
on a small-town radio station.

41:40.365 --> 41:41.965
<i>She sounds great at her job.</i>

41:42.968 --> 41:44.133
I'll talk to you later.

41:44.169 --> 41:45.301
Bye.

41:49.741 --> 41:50.707
Hey there.

41:50.742 --> 41:52.275
You working here now?

41:52.310 --> 41:53.843
I'm on winter break.

41:53.879 --> 41:55.356
Uncle Emmett
is making me earn my keep.

41:55.380 --> 41:56.412
Good for you.

41:59.851 --> 42:01.184
That's my mom.

42:01.219 --> 42:02.485
She's beautiful.

42:04.022 --> 42:05.121
You look just like her.

42:05.156 --> 42:06.189
Thanks.

42:07.592 --> 42:10.793
You know, my mom and dad

42:10.829 --> 42:12.295
passed away
when I was young, too.

42:13.732 --> 42:15.732
And I carry their pictures
with me everywhere I go.

42:17.035 --> 42:18.235
Like my own personal treasure.

42:20.539 --> 42:22.138
They look really nice.

42:23.842 --> 42:25.041
They were.

42:26.411 --> 42:27.691
I'm sure your parents were, too.

42:29.281 --> 42:30.613
Can I help you find anything?

42:31.917 --> 42:32.957
<i>What do you like to read?</i>

42:34.386 --> 42:36.386
My favorite stories
aren't available for sale.

42:36.421 --> 42:37.387
Out of stock?

42:37.422 --> 42:39.055
Never in print.

42:39.090 --> 42:40.930
Uncle Emmett makes up
the best bedtime stories.

42:42.294 --> 42:44.561
That doesn't surprise me.

42:44.596 --> 42:45.828
You know, he used to write

42:45.864 --> 42:47.408
the most incredible stories
for me when we worked together.

42:47.432 --> 42:48.731
I'm surprised he doesn't have

42:48.767 --> 42:49.777
about a dozen books
published by now.

42:49.801 --> 42:50.801
Really?

42:51.903 --> 42:53.336
Good, you're here.

42:54.573 --> 42:55.872
Hey, Steve called me last night

42:55.907 --> 42:57.587
and said the book-signing
went really well.

42:58.143 --> 42:59.420
I'm glad everyone enjoyed it.

42:59.444 --> 43:00.944
Hey, kiddo,

43:00.979 --> 43:03.279
so Nell and I have
an important meeting

43:03.315 --> 43:04.781
at the radio station.

43:04.816 --> 43:06.449
Do you want to come along
with us

43:06.484 --> 43:07.417
or do you want
to stay here with Hayley?

43:07.452 --> 43:08.718
I'll stay with Hayley.

43:10.455 --> 43:12.288
<i>We'll be back.
Tr ee o'clock.</i>

43:12.324 --> 43:13.222
You're coming, too, right, Nell?

43:13.258 --> 43:15.258
How could I refuse
a charmer like you?

43:16.928 --> 43:17.928
Thank you, Hayley.

43:20.498 --> 43:21.464
I'm Kevin LaGrange

43:21.499 --> 43:24.300
and you're listening
to "Wake up, Springdale!"

43:24.336 --> 43:25.735
I'm pleased to welcome

43:25.770 --> 43:28.237
your favorite author, and mine,
Nell Phillips.

43:28.273 --> 43:29.105
Thanks for having me, Kevin.

43:29.140 --> 43:31.874
<i>I'm a straight shooter.</i>

43:31.910 --> 43:33.087
Normally,
a heartfelt story like this

43:33.111 --> 43:34.277
is not my cup of tea,

43:34.312 --> 43:35.411
but a friend said,

43:35.447 --> 43:36.447
"Give it 10 pages, Kevin,

43:36.481 --> 43:39.415
and if you don't like it,
move on something else".

43:39.451 --> 43:42.952
But once I started,
I couldn't put it down!

43:42.988 --> 43:45.221
I was up all night
because I had to get through it.

43:46.758 --> 43:48.269
Well, I apologize
for the lack of sleep.

43:48.293 --> 43:49.492
Totally worth it.

43:49.527 --> 43:50.393
Tell me, did you always know

43:50.428 --> 43:53.229
you had what it takes
to be a writer?

43:53.264 --> 43:54.264
No, actually.

43:54.299 --> 43:56.132
When I first started,
it was more as a hobby.

43:56.167 --> 43:58.468
I'd spend hours on it,
but I still had a day job.

43:58.503 --> 44:00.069
But I got a lot of encouragement

44:00.105 --> 44:01.105
from an old friend.

44:02.040 --> 44:03.006
<i>And...</i>

44:03.041 --> 44:05.074
that gave me the confidence
to share my work.

44:05.110 --> 44:06.476
Thank goodness you did.

44:06.511 --> 44:08.945
<i>What do you hope your readers
take away from this story?</i>

44:08.980 --> 44:10.513
"Small Town Christmas"

44:10.548 --> 44:12.115
represents
the sense of community

44:12.150 --> 44:13.983
everyone is looking for,

44:14.019 --> 44:19.188
whether they live in a big city
or in a tiny village.

44:19.224 --> 44:21.591
It's that feeling of belonging,

44:21.626 --> 44:22.937
knowing that
you have people there

44:22.961 --> 44:25.728
that will stand by you
no matter what.

44:29.801 --> 44:31.012
You were really great in there.

44:31.036 --> 44:32.435
You're a natural.

44:32.470 --> 44:35.838
Thanks.

44:35.874 --> 44:38.441
You know, it's true what I said.

44:38.476 --> 44:40.154
You really did inspire me
to get my work out there.

44:40.178 --> 44:41.911
I'm really flattered, Nell.
I had no idea.

44:44.516 --> 44:45.815
What was it like for you?

44:45.850 --> 44:46.983
Moving back home?

44:47.018 --> 44:49.385
Well, gee...

44:49.421 --> 44:52.155
It was a huge adjustment,

44:52.190 --> 44:54.724
trading in big city
for a quieter life.

44:54.759 --> 44:56.626
It was, you know...

44:56.661 --> 44:57.661
I can imagine.

44:59.164 --> 45:01.204
And on top of that,
you became a guardian overnight.

45:01.599 --> 45:03.533
Well, that was
definitely a challenge.

45:03.568 --> 45:04.534
You know,
it's still a challenge.

45:04.569 --> 45:06.803
I'm just trying to do
the best job that I can.

45:06.838 --> 45:08.204
You know, actually,

45:08.239 --> 45:10.006
my parents offered

45:10.041 --> 45:12.709
to take Marnie
down to Florida with them.

45:12.744 --> 45:15.845
What made you decide
to stay here?

45:15.880 --> 45:18.181
It didn't seem fair to Marnie
to move her down there

45:18.216 --> 45:21.250
after her life had already
changed so dramatically.

45:21.286 --> 45:23.720
And, well, Paige...

45:23.755 --> 45:26.322
Paige listed me as her guardian

45:26.357 --> 45:27.824
if anything
were to happen to them,

45:27.859 --> 45:29.139
and I just wanted to honor that.

45:30.128 --> 45:31.672
You made a tremendous sacrifice
for your family.

45:31.696 --> 45:33.196
That's what family does, Nell.

45:35.700 --> 45:37.620
I really admire you
for how you handled things.

45:39.037 --> 45:40.837
Marnie is very lucky
to have you.

45:40.872 --> 45:41.872
I am the lucky one.

45:43.308 --> 45:45.108
I hope you're ready
for tree decorating,

45:45.143 --> 45:46.843
because Marnie takes this
very seriously.

45:48.813 --> 45:50.546
She takes everything
very seriously.

45:50.582 --> 45:51.681
I'll follow her lead.

45:51.716 --> 45:54.050
Just one small detail
we need to take care of first.

45:54.085 --> 45:55.585
What detail?

46:00.091 --> 46:01.451
All right, here she is.

46:04.996 --> 46:06.062
Seriously?

46:06.097 --> 46:08.131
We have to cut this down
ourselves?

46:08.166 --> 46:10.600
<i>No, you have to cut it down.</i>

46:10.635 --> 46:13.169
The guest of honor always
cuts down the Christmas tree.

46:13.204 --> 46:14.904
That is a Springdale tradition.

46:14.939 --> 46:15.671
Pretty sure
you just made that up.

46:15.707 --> 46:16.773
Nah. Nah.

46:16.808 --> 46:17.840
Come on.

46:17.876 --> 46:19.408
Get swinging, Miss Bunyan.

46:20.979 --> 46:21.844
I do yoga three times a week,

46:21.880 --> 46:24.480
but my axe-wielding skills
are limited.

46:24.516 --> 46:25.659
Don't underestimate yourself.

46:25.683 --> 46:26.683
Is this even legal?

46:26.718 --> 46:29.185
We are on private land,

46:29.220 --> 46:30.765
but the owners are in Florida,
so no biggie.

46:30.789 --> 46:31.821
Emmett!

46:31.856 --> 46:33.601
It's my parents property,
I promise. It's fine.

46:33.625 --> 46:34.657
Get chopping.

46:36.027 --> 46:37.426
Can you do it?

46:37.462 --> 46:38.606
I really don't like
killing trees.

46:38.630 --> 46:39.874
Oh, really? What do you think
your books are made of?

46:39.898 --> 46:40.898
Please?

46:42.300 --> 46:43.477
All right, I'll tell you what,
I'll make you a deal.

46:43.501 --> 46:46.803
I will cut down this tree if...

46:46.838 --> 46:47.838
if you read my work.

46:49.407 --> 46:50.606
You're still writing?

46:50.642 --> 46:52.008
Yeah. Here and there.

46:52.043 --> 46:52.909
I'm a little rusty

46:52.944 --> 46:54.054
and I think your notes
would be helpful.

46:54.078 --> 46:55.845
Of course.

46:55.880 --> 46:57.847
Why didn't you say
something earlier?

46:57.882 --> 47:00.183
Well, I was worried
that you'd be too busy for me

47:00.218 --> 47:02.652
now that you're
a big, famous writer and all.

47:02.687 --> 47:05.054
Never.

47:05.089 --> 47:06.649
I'm so happy to hear
you didn't give up.

47:08.092 --> 47:09.292
Well...

47:09.327 --> 47:10.459
You're very talented.

47:10.495 --> 47:14.363
You know, I know that you say
that I've inspired you,

47:14.399 --> 47:17.300
but you...

47:17.335 --> 47:18.575
you're a big inspiration to me.

47:20.772 --> 47:21.737
I might be your biggest fan.

47:21.773 --> 47:23.306
Is that so?

47:23.341 --> 47:26.175
Well, next to Marnie, of course.

47:26.211 --> 47:27.971
Speaking of,
we shouldn't keep her waiting.

47:29.714 --> 47:31.147
That's all you.

47:32.550 --> 47:33.550
Come on.

47:37.355 --> 47:38.795
Sure you don't need help
with that?

47:39.691 --> 47:41.390
Ho, ho, ho!
Merry Christmas!

47:43.194 --> 47:44.393
It's huge!

47:45.496 --> 47:47.864
It's going to be beautiful
when it's all decorated.

47:47.899 --> 47:52.235
Now, I will see you three
at the gingerbread contest.

47:52.270 --> 47:53.502
Bye-bye, Mrs. Ferguson.

47:53.538 --> 47:55.037
- Drive safe.
- Bye, Mrs. Ferguson.

47:56.541 --> 47:58.701
This year, Uncle Emmett and I
are taking first place!

47:59.644 --> 48:01.055
Not if I have
anything to say about it.

48:01.079 --> 48:02.445
Really?
Did you hear that?

48:02.480 --> 48:04.380
Look at the ornament
Mrs. Ferguson and I made

48:04.415 --> 48:05.514
for the tree!

48:05.550 --> 48:06.415
Hold on a second.

48:06.451 --> 48:07.795
Are you telling me
that you made that?

48:07.819 --> 48:09.285
No. There is no way.

48:09.320 --> 48:11.554
Do you think she made that?

48:11.589 --> 48:12.589
Definitely not.

48:12.624 --> 48:13.664
An ornament that beautiful

48:13.691 --> 48:16.259
had to have been bought
at a super-fancy store.

48:16.294 --> 48:18.305
I'm telling you, Mrs. Ferguson
taught me how to make them.

48:18.329 --> 48:20.429
Sweetheart, I believe you.

48:20.465 --> 48:22.198
It's beautiful.
Of course, she did.

48:22.233 --> 48:23.473
We're going to set the tree up.

48:26.070 --> 48:27.081
Can I tell you a secret?

48:27.105 --> 48:28.237
Yeah.

48:28.273 --> 48:31.073
I got Uncle Emmett
for Secret Santa,

48:31.109 --> 48:32.253
but I don't know
what to get him.

48:32.277 --> 48:33.242
Can you help me?

48:33.278 --> 48:34.777
Of course.

48:34.812 --> 48:35.812
I won't tell a soul.

48:40.251 --> 48:41.851
Let the tree trimming begin!

48:42.921 --> 48:43.753
Okay...

48:43.788 --> 48:46.722
Wait! Before you start,
I have a system.

48:46.758 --> 48:48.291
Let me show you.

48:48.326 --> 48:49.725
You've got to go with it.

48:49.761 --> 48:50.960
Okay.

48:50.995 --> 48:52.728
Show me how to do it.

48:52.764 --> 48:54.964
You see,
it's very just kind of...

48:54.999 --> 48:58.401
Yeah. I've been doing it wrong
my whole life, I think.

48:58.436 --> 48:59.902
You didn't even know it,
did you?

48:59.938 --> 49:00.938
I didn't, no.

49:00.972 --> 49:01.972
A method to the madness.

49:04.809 --> 49:05.908
Hi, Mr. Hathaway.

49:05.944 --> 49:08.244
I'm sorry, we're closed
for the gingerbread contest.

49:08.279 --> 49:09.690
That's okay. I'm actually here
to talk about business.

49:09.714 --> 49:10.846
Business?

49:10.882 --> 49:11.882
Yeah.

49:17.188 --> 49:18.120
It's perfect.

49:18.156 --> 49:19.588
It sure is.

49:19.624 --> 49:21.824
Hey, kiddo,
it's almost gingerbread time.

49:21.859 --> 49:24.493
I'll go upstairs and get ready!

49:25.863 --> 49:26.863
She's happy.

49:28.333 --> 49:29.265
You're great with her.

49:29.300 --> 49:30.766
You think so?

49:30.802 --> 49:32.301
I worry she's not
having any fun,

49:32.337 --> 49:33.302
you know, like a proper kid.

49:33.338 --> 49:34.837
We had fun just now, didn't we?

49:34.872 --> 49:36.472
Totally. Totally.

49:36.507 --> 49:37.940
But you know, I worry

49:37.976 --> 49:40.142
that she takes herself
too seriously.

49:40.178 --> 49:43.112
I think that she thinks
of herself as a burden,

49:43.147 --> 49:45.715
and that's why she has to be
so perfect all the time.

49:45.750 --> 49:47.027
I tell her
that she's already perfect,

49:47.051 --> 49:48.051
and she is.

49:48.086 --> 49:50.319
I'm sure she knows
how much she means to you,

49:50.355 --> 49:51.721
and I'm certain
Paige would approve

49:51.756 --> 49:52.955
of everything you're doing.

49:52.991 --> 49:54.490
Thanks, Nell.

49:57.261 --> 49:58.301
Has it been hard to date?

49:59.163 --> 50:01.764
You know, with raising Marnie
by yourself?

50:05.870 --> 50:07.703
I sort of gave up
on that part of my life

50:07.739 --> 50:09.005
when I moved back here.

50:09.040 --> 50:10.206
You know, Marnie,

50:10.241 --> 50:11.340
she had lost so much.

50:11.376 --> 50:14.343
I didn't want anything
to come between the two of us.

50:14.379 --> 50:16.712
Dating, it hasn't really been
a priority in my life.

50:18.383 --> 50:21.183
How are things with Brad?

50:23.087 --> 50:24.420
Nothing really to report.

50:24.455 --> 50:26.022
We just met.

50:28.192 --> 50:30.326
Yeah, I just wanted
to make sure you're happy.

50:31.796 --> 50:32.862
Thanks.

50:40.972 --> 50:43.606
All right, everyone has candy
at their stations.

50:43.641 --> 50:45.274
Now, once the timer begins,

50:45.309 --> 50:46.842
you'll have
until the buzzer sounds

50:46.878 --> 50:49.078
to make
you best gingerbread house.

50:49.113 --> 50:51.380
And, as usual,

50:51.416 --> 50:54.183
your creations will be judged
by the beloved Mrs. Ferguson.

50:59.490 --> 51:01.791
I am here to be impressed,

51:01.826 --> 51:03.692
but I will not be
playing favorites!

51:05.163 --> 51:06.028
Did you hear that?

51:06.064 --> 51:07.730
Come on.
Come and get your gingerbread.

51:09.233 --> 51:11.634
- I'll be right back.
- Okay.

51:11.669 --> 51:13.803
One second.

51:13.838 --> 51:15.382
So, how are you liking
your first Kringlefest?

51:15.406 --> 51:16.639
It's amazing.

51:16.674 --> 51:17.506
Good!

51:17.542 --> 51:20.109
And this is
probably pretty different

51:20.144 --> 51:21.777
than most events you go to, huh?

51:21.813 --> 51:23.412
Oh, yeah.
I mean, it's not even close.

51:23.448 --> 51:24.448
It's even better.

51:25.917 --> 51:26.917
Good.

51:28.519 --> 51:29.718
I got something for you.

51:30.855 --> 51:32.254
It's an offer for the store.

51:32.290 --> 51:33.255
Thanks, Brad,

51:33.291 --> 51:35.391
but I'm not interested
in selling right now.

51:35.426 --> 51:37.827
Have a look at the terms
before you decide.

51:37.862 --> 51:39.273
Your shop is at
the top of my wishlist.

51:39.297 --> 51:41.964
Technically,
it's my niece's store.

51:41.999 --> 51:44.133
It'll go back into her name
when she's old enough.

51:44.168 --> 51:46.669
Right, but you have
power of attorney, correct?

51:46.704 --> 51:47.570
That's right,

51:47.605 --> 51:48.537
but I think
it's in her best interests

51:48.573 --> 51:50.306
that I hold on
to what her mother created.

51:50.341 --> 51:52.108
Hey, I totally hear you.

51:52.143 --> 51:54.677
Just have a look at the numbers
before you decide anything.

51:54.712 --> 51:56.612
It is a very generous offer

51:56.647 --> 51:58.614
and it could set the both of you
up financially.

51:58.649 --> 52:01.183
Plus, you have to think about
all that free time you'd have

52:01.219 --> 52:02.284
to pursue other interests.

52:02.320 --> 52:04.753
Okay, I'm going to read this,

52:04.789 --> 52:06.689
but I'm not going to make you
any promises.

52:06.724 --> 52:07.656
Great.
If you have any questions,

52:07.692 --> 52:08.958
you know where to find me.

52:12.864 --> 52:14.029
Sorry about that.

52:14.065 --> 52:16.599
It's okay.

52:16.634 --> 52:19.335
All right, everybody,
your time begins...

52:19.370 --> 52:20.636
now!

52:22.907 --> 52:24.807
So what were you talking
to Emmett about?

52:24.842 --> 52:25.842
His bookstore.

52:25.877 --> 52:27.521
It's one of the properties
that I want to buy.

52:27.545 --> 52:28.822
I didn't know
it was on the market.

52:28.846 --> 52:30.212
Technically, it's not,

52:30.248 --> 52:31.881
but I made him
a very generous offer.

52:31.916 --> 52:32.848
Hey...

52:32.884 --> 52:34.884
Maybe you could put in
a good word for me,

52:34.919 --> 52:36.159
since you guys are old friends?

52:38.356 --> 52:40.389
Yeah. I could do that.

52:40.424 --> 52:42.191
Thank you.

52:53.404 --> 52:55.315
All right, everybody,
this is the final minute!

52:55.339 --> 52:56.372
Looking good!

52:56.407 --> 52:57.918
That's okay, that's okay.
We can work with this.

52:57.942 --> 52:58.942
We can work with this.

53:20.798 --> 53:22.358
We did it, Marnie!
We did it!

53:24.435 --> 53:25.668
Good job, Marnie!

53:38.316 --> 53:40.516
It's been wonderful
having you here, dear.

53:40.551 --> 53:41.584
Thank you.

53:41.619 --> 53:43.297
I wish you were part of
our book club permanently.

53:43.321 --> 53:45.120
Same. That would be so fun.

53:45.156 --> 53:46.589
What's your favorite carol?

53:46.624 --> 53:48.290
I actually don't know very many.

53:48.326 --> 53:49.191
Do you think you could teach me?

53:49.227 --> 53:50.227
Sure!

53:51.562 --> 53:52.728
So...

53:52.763 --> 53:54.763
Did he make you an offer?

53:54.799 --> 53:56.131
A very large one.

53:56.167 --> 53:58.234
Did you accept it?

53:58.269 --> 54:00.202
No, but I have to say
I'm considering it.

54:01.505 --> 54:02.616
He said I could stay on
as the manager,

54:02.640 --> 54:03.606
even after the sale.

54:03.641 --> 54:05.274
It's a tough decision.

54:05.309 --> 54:08.377
It is. It is.

54:09.947 --> 54:11.247
I have to think of Marnie

54:11.282 --> 54:12.759
and what she'd want to do
with the store.

54:12.783 --> 54:15.084
Yeah, but it will be years
before she takes it over,

54:15.119 --> 54:16.563
and you don't know
what she'll want then.

54:16.587 --> 54:18.087
I know.

54:18.122 --> 54:19.202
That's the problem.
I don't.

54:22.493 --> 54:23.493
Come on.
Let's go sing.

54:30.835 --> 54:33.435
You didn't have to
walk me home...

54:33.471 --> 54:35.271
or to the inn.

54:35.306 --> 54:36.416
Don't you have to
get back to Marnie?

54:36.440 --> 54:37.339
No, no.

54:37.375 --> 54:40.976
Marnie is sleeping over
at Jenny's house.

54:41.012 --> 54:42.311
And besides, you know,

54:42.346 --> 54:44.246
Springdale at this hour

54:44.282 --> 54:47.483
is a hot-bed
of nefarious activity.

54:47.518 --> 54:49.518
Hooligans abound.

54:49.553 --> 54:51.654
Oh, yeah.
I can see that.

54:51.689 --> 54:53.722
Yeah. Yeah.

54:56.160 --> 54:58.460
Hey, I know that
you're leaving tomorrow,

54:58.496 --> 55:00.195
but I hope that we can...

55:00.231 --> 55:03.098
I hope that
we can stay in touch this time.

55:03.134 --> 55:04.134
I hope so, too.

55:04.168 --> 55:06.035
There have been so many times

55:06.070 --> 55:08.504
I'll hear something
that will remind me of you,

55:08.539 --> 55:10.539
or I'll hear something
I know would make you laugh.

55:11.242 --> 55:12.141
You never thought to call me?

55:12.176 --> 55:13.809
I did.

55:13.844 --> 55:14.943
Of course, I did, Nell.

55:14.979 --> 55:15.911
It's just that
it doesn't seem fair

55:15.946 --> 55:17.713
to jump back into your life,
out of the blue.

55:17.748 --> 55:21.016
It would have been nice
to hear your voice.

55:21.052 --> 55:22.532
And at least know
you were doing okay.

55:23.321 --> 55:24.321
Yeah.

55:25.656 --> 55:27.616
Next time the mood strikes,
promise you'll call?

55:31.929 --> 55:33.262
I promise.

55:34.732 --> 55:36.131
Hey, so I have to chat

55:36.167 --> 55:37.511
with Marnie tomorrow
before I leave.

55:37.535 --> 55:39.868
We have some
important business to discuss.

55:39.904 --> 55:41.570
She's not going to let you leave

55:41.605 --> 55:43.038
without saying a proper goodbye.

55:51.949 --> 55:53.916
I'm going to go now.
Goodnight.

55:53.951 --> 55:55.651
Make sure you send me
those stories.

55:55.686 --> 55:56.752
Oh, yeah.

55:56.787 --> 55:58.654
I'll make sure you get them.

55:58.689 --> 55:59.900
I'll make some copies
before you leave.

55:59.924 --> 56:02.024
Maybe you can read them
on the plane?

56:02.059 --> 56:03.425
Sounds good.
I will.

56:03.461 --> 56:05.361
Merry Christmas, Nell.

56:05.396 --> 56:07.162
Merry Christmas.

56:10.768 --> 56:12.134
Goodnight.

56:29.987 --> 56:32.221
Caroline! Hi!

56:32.256 --> 56:33.188
I think you're going to be
super excited

56:33.224 --> 56:34.384
when you see these new pages.

56:36.227 --> 56:37.626
Are you okay?

56:37.661 --> 56:38.494
We've been hit.

56:38.529 --> 56:40.028
What?

56:40.064 --> 56:41.463
<i>The entire family has the flu.</i>

56:41.499 --> 56:42.843
The girls must have
caught it at school

56:42.867 --> 56:45.334
and brought it home
to infect all of us.

56:45.369 --> 56:46.880
We're just gonna
quarantine ourselves in here

56:46.904 --> 56:48.237
until it passes.

56:48.272 --> 56:49.304
<i>That's horrible.</i>

56:49.340 --> 56:51.740
Can I order you
some chicken soup or something?

56:51.776 --> 56:53.509
Do they sell it by the gallon?

56:54.845 --> 56:55.811
I'm so sorry!

56:55.846 --> 56:56.912
<i>No, I'm sorry.</i>

56:56.947 --> 56:59.515
I'm sorry
for leaving you stranded.

56:59.550 --> 57:01.094
Tell me that you have
somewhere to go for Christmas.

57:01.118 --> 57:03.752
No, it's all right.

57:03.788 --> 57:06.355
I'll get some takeout
and get some work done.

57:06.390 --> 57:08.223
<i>It'll be good for me.</i>

57:08.259 --> 57:09.539
Come on, I feel even worse now.

57:10.461 --> 57:11.661
Just focus on getting better.

57:12.963 --> 57:14.696
So how have things been going?

57:14.732 --> 57:16.064
Good.

57:16.100 --> 57:17.344
Yeah, I think you'll be pleased.

57:17.368 --> 57:18.200
No, no.

57:18.235 --> 57:19.513
I mean how are things
going with Brad?

57:19.537 --> 57:23.505
I don't think things are going
anywhere with Brad, actually.

57:25.309 --> 57:27.042
I was really excited
by his enthusiasm,

57:27.077 --> 57:29.611
but I think he might be
a bit misguided.

57:29.647 --> 57:30.846
And how about Emmett?

57:30.881 --> 57:34.883
I have a lot of respect for him.

57:34.919 --> 57:36.385
The way he looks after Marnie

57:36.420 --> 57:40.456
and... the town...

57:40.491 --> 57:41.323
it's really inspiring.

57:41.358 --> 57:44.092
Inspiring some more pages,
I hope?

57:44.128 --> 57:45.394
Even the flu can't stop you.

57:46.564 --> 57:47.796
Merry Christmas!

57:47.832 --> 57:49.231
I gotta go.

57:49.266 --> 57:50.599
Merry Christmas.

58:09.653 --> 58:10.797
You guys
are going to love it here.

58:10.821 --> 58:12.988
My renderings
can only show so much.

58:13.023 --> 58:14.456
The local diner will serve

58:14.492 --> 58:16.291
artisanal cheese
and imported wines?

58:16.327 --> 58:17.292
That's right. Yeah.

58:17.328 --> 58:18.772
Only the best
for our prospective visitors.

58:18.796 --> 58:20.395
Now, the research says

58:20.431 --> 58:21.230
that bringing in

58:21.265 --> 58:22.998
higher-end clientele
to Springdale

58:23.033 --> 58:24.144
is the best way
to turn it around financially.

58:24.168 --> 58:25.168
Hey!

58:25.202 --> 58:26.502
Nell!

58:26.537 --> 58:27.814
You came down just in time.
Have a seat.

58:27.838 --> 58:28.804
These are my colleagues.

58:28.839 --> 58:29.938
This is Julia and Lance.

58:29.974 --> 58:32.107
This is Nell Phillips,
the novelist I told you about.

58:32.142 --> 58:33.142
Hi.

58:34.545 --> 58:37.012
So, what do you have planned
for PaigeTurner?

58:37.047 --> 58:39.014
Just a few embellishments
and upgrades.

58:39.049 --> 58:40.916
Now, the main thing I want to do

58:40.951 --> 58:43.118
is get rid of that
quaint, old cataloguing system

58:43.153 --> 58:46.188
for something people can,
you know, actually understand.

58:46.223 --> 58:47.289
I see.

58:47.324 --> 58:48.190
Are you from here, Nell?

58:48.225 --> 58:49.992
No...

58:50.027 --> 58:50.926
but I'm starting to wish I was.

58:50.961 --> 58:52.661
Brad was just about
to give us the tour.

58:52.696 --> 58:53.629
Would you like to join us?

58:53.664 --> 58:55.797
No thanks.

58:55.833 --> 58:56.977
Brad and I see this town
a little differently.

58:57.001 --> 58:58.634
But enjoy it.

58:58.669 --> 58:59.909
Springdale's a wonderful place.

59:01.805 --> 59:03.605
I should go.

59:03.641 --> 59:04.606
Hold on one second.

59:04.642 --> 59:05.974
Hey, Nell, wait up.

59:07.344 --> 59:08.277
Are you upset with me?

59:08.312 --> 59:11.380
No. Not at all.

59:11.415 --> 59:13.982
I just feel like
I finally understand you.

59:14.018 --> 59:15.350
Brad?

59:15.386 --> 59:17.286
- Are you ready?
- Just one second.

59:18.489 --> 59:20.155
You should go deal
with your colleagues.

59:20.190 --> 59:20.989
Are you sure?

59:21.025 --> 59:22.991
That's why you came here,
isn't it?

59:24.061 --> 59:25.427
Goodbye, Brad.

59:29.099 --> 59:30.859
You guys ready
for the big Springdale tour?

59:36.507 --> 59:38.974
So where did it fall
on the X axis?

59:39.009 --> 59:41.143
- Six?
- And then this one?

59:41.178 --> 59:42.311
Three?

59:42.346 --> 59:43.812
There's the girl
I wanted to see!

59:43.847 --> 59:46.014
Nell!

59:46.050 --> 59:46.949
So I have an idea

59:46.984 --> 59:48.664
for that project
you were telling me about.

59:50.120 --> 59:51.954
Hey, Nell, secrets are no fun.

59:55.793 --> 59:56.692
So, your last day, huh?

59:56.727 --> 59:58.026
Yep.

59:58.062 --> 59:58.860
It all went by so fast.

59:58.896 --> 01:00:00.896
What are you doing
for Christmas?

01:00:00.931 --> 01:00:01.997
Well, as it turns out...

01:00:02.032 --> 01:00:03.032
nothing.

01:00:03.067 --> 01:00:04.433
Nothing?

01:00:04.468 --> 01:00:05.867
You can't do nothing
for Christmas.

01:00:05.903 --> 01:00:07.002
That's no good.

01:00:07.037 --> 01:00:08.870
I know,
but my friend and her family

01:00:08.906 --> 01:00:11.106
just came down with the flu.

01:00:11.141 --> 01:00:12.841
Well, all right,

01:00:12.876 --> 01:00:14.743
well, the solution seems
pretty obvious to me.

01:00:14.778 --> 01:00:15.577
You're going to forget

01:00:15.613 --> 01:00:16.723
your flight
back to New York City.

01:00:16.747 --> 01:00:17.913
And stay here?

01:00:17.948 --> 01:00:19.514
You could do Secret Santa!

01:00:19.550 --> 01:00:21.216
You did say
the atmosphere around here

01:00:21.251 --> 01:00:22.562
was helping clear up
your writer's block.

01:00:22.586 --> 01:00:24.720
I did say that...

01:00:24.755 --> 01:00:26.188
I did say that.

01:00:26.223 --> 01:00:28.602
<i>And I have always wanted to see
a true Springdale Christmas...</i>

01:00:28.626 --> 01:00:30.292
Well, then it sounds to me

01:00:30.327 --> 01:00:32.361
like the solution
is pretty obvious.

01:00:33.664 --> 01:00:35.130
Okay. I guess I'm staying.

01:00:35.165 --> 01:00:36.431
Yay!

01:00:36.467 --> 01:00:37.811
Want to go skating
with me and Jenny?

01:00:37.835 --> 01:00:39.635
I have some bad news, kiddo.

01:00:39.670 --> 01:00:40.747
I have to stick around here

01:00:40.771 --> 01:00:43.138
and help the caterers
set up for tomorrow's party.

01:00:43.173 --> 01:00:44.473
Shoot. Well, you know what,

01:00:44.508 --> 01:00:45.952
if you can wait a few hours,
I'll take you.

01:00:45.976 --> 01:00:46.908
That's okay.

01:00:46.944 --> 01:00:49.878
I can just do
some math exercises instead.

01:00:49.913 --> 01:00:51.413
I can take her.

01:00:54.318 --> 01:00:55.829
Well, I'm... if you're
in the middle of writing,

01:00:55.853 --> 01:00:57.219
I don't want to disturb you.

01:00:57.254 --> 01:00:58.920
No, it's fine.
I could use a break.

01:00:58.956 --> 01:00:59.821
You're sure?

01:00:59.857 --> 01:01:01.490
Please, Uncle Emmett!

01:01:01.525 --> 01:01:02.624
All right.

01:01:02.660 --> 01:01:03.825
Well, if you're sure.

01:01:03.861 --> 01:01:05.260
Come on!

01:01:05.295 --> 01:01:06.295
But I have to warn you,

01:01:06.330 --> 01:01:08.664
the last time I went skating,
I was your age.

01:01:08.699 --> 01:01:09.931
I might need some extra help.

01:01:09.967 --> 01:01:12.801
Marnie, don't break her.

01:01:19.810 --> 01:01:21.677
You weren't kidding.

01:01:21.712 --> 01:01:24.312
Yeah, ice really isn't my thing.

01:01:25.816 --> 01:01:28.417
You'll never learn
if you don't let go.

01:01:30.020 --> 01:01:31.865
Has anyone ever told you
you're a very astute kid?

01:01:31.889 --> 01:01:34.322
Uncle Emmett says I'm advanced.

01:01:34.358 --> 01:01:35.358
I study all the time.

01:01:36.794 --> 01:01:37.954
Let's sit down for a second.

01:01:41.632 --> 01:01:42.698
You know,

01:01:42.733 --> 01:01:44.800
you don't have to worry so much
about your grades.

01:01:44.835 --> 01:01:46.134
You're still just a kid.

01:01:49.173 --> 01:01:51.454
I told you I lost my parents
when I was young, too, right?

01:01:52.009 --> 01:01:52.974
I wasn't as young as you,

01:01:53.010 --> 01:01:55.243
but I remember how hard it was.

01:01:56.380 --> 01:01:57.212
Did you have other family?

01:01:57.247 --> 01:02:00.015
I have an aunt and uncle
and cousins.

01:02:00.050 --> 01:02:02.017
I see them a few times a year.

01:02:03.353 --> 01:02:05.131
And some of my closest friends
became like family.

01:02:05.155 --> 01:02:06.822
That's nice.

01:02:08.225 --> 01:02:09.057
I just want you to know

01:02:09.093 --> 01:02:12.227
that your uncle
is so proud of you,

01:02:12.262 --> 01:02:14.663
and the one thing
that makes him happiest

01:02:14.698 --> 01:02:15.698
<i>is seeing you happy.</i>

01:02:19.203 --> 01:02:20.836
Should we try this again?

01:02:20.871 --> 01:02:21.871
I need practice.

01:02:24.775 --> 01:02:26.135
You've got to give me
some lessons.

01:02:27.010 --> 01:02:28.376
Let's go fast.

01:02:35.519 --> 01:02:38.553
Well, looks like
skating was a success!

01:02:38.589 --> 01:02:40.155
Hey, how'd she do?

01:02:40.190 --> 01:02:42.157
She's basically a professional.

01:02:43.360 --> 01:02:44.871
"Basically a professional"?

01:02:44.895 --> 01:02:46.575
That's high praise.
I've never gotten that.

01:02:49.266 --> 01:02:51.166
Hey! Hi, Stacy.

01:02:51.201 --> 01:02:52.567
Hi, Mr. Turner!

01:02:52.603 --> 01:02:54.202
Hey, Marnie!

01:02:54.238 --> 01:02:55.537
So, we're going to go.

01:02:55.572 --> 01:02:56.938
The kitchen is full of food.

01:02:56.974 --> 01:02:57.839
Help yourself
to whatever food you want.

01:02:57.875 --> 01:02:59.574
Thanks!

01:02:59.610 --> 01:03:00.542
Let's make a little snack
right now, okay?

01:03:00.577 --> 01:03:02.544
And, hey, you, young lady,

01:03:02.579 --> 01:03:04.224
are not allowed to do
any homework while I am gone.

01:03:04.248 --> 01:03:05.248
Do you understand?

01:03:05.282 --> 01:03:07.215
Only fun things.
Is that clear?

01:03:07.251 --> 01:03:09.217
Clear!

01:03:09.253 --> 01:03:10.585
Clear. All right.
Love you.

01:03:10.621 --> 01:03:11.553
- Have fun.
- Thanks.

01:03:11.588 --> 01:03:13.308
- Bye! We'll see you later.
- See you later.

01:03:14.424 --> 01:03:15.424
Bye-bye.

01:03:22.900 --> 01:03:23.799
Well, thank you

01:03:23.834 --> 01:03:25.245
for helping me set up
for the book club.

01:03:25.269 --> 01:03:26.067
It's the least I can do,

01:03:26.103 --> 01:03:27.247
the way everyone's
welcomed me in.

01:03:27.271 --> 01:03:28.537
Especially you.

01:03:30.107 --> 01:03:32.908
All right, so we know
you're no good at winter sports.

01:03:32.943 --> 01:03:34.009
What do you do for fun?

01:03:34.044 --> 01:03:36.812
I'll have you know,
the second the weather warms up,

01:03:36.847 --> 01:03:38.291
I'll be showing off
my softball skills!

01:03:38.315 --> 01:03:40.015
Now, that I would like to see.

01:03:41.418 --> 01:03:42.818
I still like going
to the theater.

01:03:45.122 --> 01:03:47.082
That's another thing I miss
about New York City.

01:03:47.791 --> 01:03:49.235
I signed up to help
with the local theater group,

01:03:49.259 --> 01:03:51.493
and Jenny...

01:03:51.528 --> 01:03:53.228
has a beautiful singing voice.

01:03:54.464 --> 01:03:55.997
No kidding?

01:03:56.033 --> 01:03:58.099
Yeah. We're putting on

01:03:58.135 --> 01:04:00.302
a production
of "My Fair Lady" this spring.

01:04:01.371 --> 01:04:02.448
You should come back and see it.

01:04:02.472 --> 01:04:03.472
Wouldn't that be lovely?

01:04:05.342 --> 01:04:07.108
That's a reference
from the play.

01:04:20.858 --> 01:04:21.858
Thank you.

01:04:23.894 --> 01:04:25.126
Hi.

01:04:25.162 --> 01:04:26.528
Welcome to the book club!

01:04:26.563 --> 01:04:27.563
Hi, Nell.

01:04:29.800 --> 01:04:34.669
Nell, you described
how we celebrate Christmas here.

01:04:34.705 --> 01:04:38.240
You did it so perfectly
in your book.

01:04:38.275 --> 01:04:40.742
That's why I'm so nervous
about Brad's proposal.

01:04:40.777 --> 01:04:43.411
I don't want him to change
what makes this town so special.

01:04:43.447 --> 01:04:44.813
It's not change.

01:04:44.848 --> 01:04:45.814
It's enhancement.

01:04:45.849 --> 01:04:47.415
Oh, please!

01:04:47.451 --> 01:04:50.652
He wants to turn this town
into a cookie-cutter town,

01:04:50.687 --> 01:04:53.255
with no heart.

01:04:53.290 --> 01:04:55.257
Well, Brad's ideas
have been interesting.

01:04:55.292 --> 01:04:56.936
I mean, especially since
my sales have been so down.

01:04:56.960 --> 01:05:00.395
He did just come and give us
a very generous offer.

01:05:02.499 --> 01:05:04.532
We haven't made any decisions.

01:05:04.568 --> 01:05:07.702
But with what he offered,

01:05:07.738 --> 01:05:10.839
we would have a nest egg
for our little egg.

01:05:12.676 --> 01:05:13.786
And Emm could do the same
for Marnie.

01:05:13.810 --> 01:05:14.976
I don't know, Hayley.

01:05:15.012 --> 01:05:16.144
This isn't just a store.

01:05:16.179 --> 01:05:17.112
It's my sister's legacy.

01:05:17.147 --> 01:05:18.625
It'll still be here
if you want to visit.

01:05:18.649 --> 01:05:20.215
Listen, Steve,

01:05:20.250 --> 01:05:22.150
I appreciate how attractive
these offers sound,

01:05:22.185 --> 01:05:23.351
I really do,

01:05:23.387 --> 01:05:24.352
but don't we value

01:05:24.388 --> 01:05:25.388
our own traditions

01:05:25.422 --> 01:05:27.188
and the community that we built?

01:05:28.659 --> 01:05:29.391
I mean, life can't be
measured out

01:05:29.426 --> 01:05:30.625
in dollars and cents.

01:05:30.661 --> 01:05:32.160
I'm sorry,

01:05:32.195 --> 01:05:33.695
but I, for one,

01:05:33.730 --> 01:05:35.297
am not going to accept
the offer.

01:05:38.669 --> 01:05:40.902
Well...

01:05:40.938 --> 01:05:42.858
this is book club,
so let's get back to the book.

01:05:45.042 --> 01:05:47.309
Nell, I was wondering,

01:05:47.344 --> 01:05:48.664
what is
your writing process like?

01:05:49.913 --> 01:05:50.913
Is that the correct term?

01:05:52.683 --> 01:05:54.316
Well, I start
with brainstorming.

01:05:54.351 --> 01:05:56.251
You've probably seen me around
with my notebook?

01:05:56.286 --> 01:05:57.764
You must be finding
lots of new details

01:05:57.788 --> 01:05:58.865
to incorporate into the sequel.

01:05:58.889 --> 01:06:00.822
Which we can't wait for!

01:06:02.125 --> 01:06:04.359
Absolutely.

01:06:04.394 --> 01:06:05.860
Descriptions, funny ideas,

01:06:05.896 --> 01:06:06.828
lines of dialogue.

01:06:06.863 --> 01:06:08.697
I write down everything.

01:06:08.732 --> 01:06:09.909
I don't even turn on my laptop

01:06:09.933 --> 01:06:11.177
until I have
a clear roadmap ready.

01:06:11.201 --> 01:06:13.668
So you're oldfashioned
like Emmett.

01:06:13.704 --> 01:06:17.138
What I think Steve means is
that Nell and I are classic.

01:06:19.476 --> 01:06:21.076
I like the feeling
of my pen and paper.

01:06:21.111 --> 01:06:22.877
I can't describe it.

01:06:22.913 --> 01:06:24.724
It's... there's just something
substantial about it.

01:06:24.748 --> 01:06:26.181
Substantial! See!

01:06:26.216 --> 01:06:27.216
No. No.

01:06:28.552 --> 01:06:30.452
Why don't you tell us
a bit about Amanda.

01:06:30.487 --> 01:06:31.319
Was she based on you?

01:06:31.355 --> 01:06:34.522
I mean, I notice
that you're both single.

01:06:36.293 --> 01:06:37.225
Well, you know,

01:06:37.260 --> 01:06:40.562
I don't know
if Amanda was inspired by me,

01:06:40.597 --> 01:06:43.064
or if I was inspired by her.

01:06:44.234 --> 01:06:45.467
You're right.

01:06:45.502 --> 01:06:47.202
I have been focusing
on my career

01:06:47.237 --> 01:06:49.404
and not really dating
much lately.

01:06:50.574 --> 01:06:52.007
I thought you were dating Brad.

01:06:53.643 --> 01:06:54.643
We're not dating.

01:06:55.846 --> 01:06:57.278
So final impressions

01:06:57.314 --> 01:06:59.614
of the town
that inspired Derryville?

01:06:59.649 --> 01:07:00.827
I thought I knew
what it would feel like

01:07:00.851 --> 01:07:02.751
to be part of a tight-knit town.

01:07:04.087 --> 01:07:07.555
But after being here
and experiencing it...

01:07:07.591 --> 01:07:12.794
my imagination pales
in comparison to the real thing.

01:07:12.829 --> 01:07:14.329
And you can't simply replace

01:07:14.364 --> 01:07:17.565
the things that make
Springdale... Springdale.

01:07:25.275 --> 01:07:27.642
No Springdale Christmas

01:07:27.677 --> 01:07:30.011
would be complete
without a carriage ride.

01:07:30.047 --> 01:07:31.524
Would you care for
a jaunt around the town?

01:07:31.548 --> 01:07:33.415
I thought you'd never ask.

01:07:33.450 --> 01:07:34.949
M'lady.

01:07:37.054 --> 01:07:38.987
- You got it?
- Yeah.

01:07:39.022 --> 01:07:40.989
Let me see if I can get up.

01:07:41.024 --> 01:07:42.857
Here's a little blanket.

01:07:42.893 --> 01:07:44.993
All right, we're all ready.

01:07:49.499 --> 01:07:51.299
I read your stories today.

01:07:51.334 --> 01:07:52.534
Oh, right.

01:07:52.569 --> 01:07:53.935
Yikes.

01:07:53.970 --> 01:07:56.304
Put me out of my misery.
What did you think?

01:07:56.339 --> 01:07:58.673
They're fantastic.

01:07:58.708 --> 01:08:00.675
I'm serious, Emmett.

01:08:00.710 --> 01:08:02.055
A gift like that
shouldn't be hidden away.

01:08:02.079 --> 01:08:05.380
Well, it's not...
it's not in hiding.

01:08:05.415 --> 01:08:07.282
I'm on hiatus
until Marnie is okay.

01:08:07.317 --> 01:08:08.950
She is okay.

01:08:08.985 --> 01:08:11.286
She more than okay.
She's amazing.

01:08:11.321 --> 01:08:13.032
And I know you want to be
a good role model for her,

01:08:13.056 --> 01:08:15.623
so shouldn't you show her
how to pursue your dreams?

01:08:15.659 --> 01:08:19.027
Geez.
When you put it like that...

01:08:19.062 --> 01:08:21.462
You need to stop
putting your own life on hold.

01:08:21.497 --> 01:08:24.032
Okay, I never wanted
to run a store,

01:08:24.067 --> 01:08:24.899
but I've grown to love it,

01:08:24.935 --> 01:08:26.667
and it helps me feel
close to Paige,

01:08:26.703 --> 01:08:28.803
and I can honor her memory
by doing right by it...

01:08:28.839 --> 01:08:29.871
and Marnie.

01:08:32.209 --> 01:08:35.310
I think you should do
whatever makes you happy.

01:08:35.345 --> 01:08:37.145
It's time you went after
what you really want.

01:09:01.438 --> 01:09:02.604
Hey, good morning, Peanut!

01:09:02.639 --> 01:09:04.671
Merry Christmas Eve!

01:09:04.707 --> 01:09:05.952
How are you liking Nell's book?

01:09:05.975 --> 01:09:07.408
I love it!

01:09:07.444 --> 01:09:08.910
My favorite
is the boy Amanda likes.

01:09:08.944 --> 01:09:10.104
He kind of reminds me of you.

01:09:15.819 --> 01:09:17.430
All right, I'm going
to make some breakfast.

01:09:17.453 --> 01:09:18.774
I'll let you know
when it's ready.

01:09:23.760 --> 01:09:25.026
Well, Nell dear,

01:09:25.060 --> 01:09:27.395
you have put some pep
in the town's step.

01:09:29.099 --> 01:09:31.466
<i>I feel like the town
has put some pep in my step.</i>

01:09:31.501 --> 01:09:33.268
I think that being on the road

01:09:33.303 --> 01:09:35.203
as long as
you've been on the road,

01:09:35.238 --> 01:09:39.040
well, I would think
you'd be anxious to get home.

01:09:39.075 --> 01:09:41.075
Yeah. I suppose so.

01:09:41.111 --> 01:09:42.443
But, to be honest,

01:09:42.479 --> 01:09:43.719
it's really just become a place

01:09:43.747 --> 01:09:45.279
I can put my clothes away
and sleep.

01:09:46.483 --> 01:09:47.247
It's nothing like
what you have here.

01:09:47.283 --> 01:09:48.983
This...

01:09:49.019 --> 01:09:50.618
This takes years to build up.

01:09:50.654 --> 01:09:51.731
You have a very special home.

01:09:51.755 --> 01:09:53.587
Thank you.

01:09:53.622 --> 01:09:56.324
Now, between us girls,

01:09:56.359 --> 01:09:58.193
what is it you're looking for?

01:10:00.330 --> 01:10:01.963
I don't have a list or anything.

01:10:01.998 --> 01:10:04.465
Just someone that I can trust,

01:10:04.501 --> 01:10:07.435
who makes me laugh.

01:10:07.470 --> 01:10:08.803
Mostly...

01:10:08.838 --> 01:10:09.737
I just want a partnership

01:10:09.773 --> 01:10:11.317
where we can support
each other's goals.

01:10:11.341 --> 01:10:12.840
And you've not found that yet?

01:10:15.378 --> 01:10:16.644
Sorry to barge in.

01:10:16.680 --> 01:10:17.823
It's Hayley.
She's gone into labor.

01:10:17.847 --> 01:10:19.814
But she's a month early!

01:10:19.849 --> 01:10:22.417
I told Emmett we'd meet him
at Steve and Hayley's house.

01:10:22.452 --> 01:10:23.452
Let's go!

01:10:32.996 --> 01:10:34.207
Hey, everyone.
Thanks for coming.

01:10:34.231 --> 01:10:35.797
- How's Hayley?
- Is there any word yet?

01:10:35.832 --> 01:10:36.798
It's good news.

01:10:36.833 --> 01:10:37.833
Steve called.

01:10:37.867 --> 01:10:38.878
They had the baby an hour ago.

01:10:38.902 --> 01:10:40.068
It's a girl!
A healthy girl.

01:10:40.103 --> 01:10:41.369
That's wonderful!

01:10:41.404 --> 01:10:43.304
How can we help?

01:10:43.340 --> 01:10:45.206
Well, since the baby
was born a month early,

01:10:45.242 --> 01:10:46.752
Steve wasn't able
to finish the nursery

01:10:46.776 --> 01:10:47.609
and he still needs
baby supplies,

01:10:47.644 --> 01:10:48.721
so we're all going
to pitch in, yeah?

01:10:48.745 --> 01:10:50.590
I'll go to the diner
and get snacks for everyone.

01:10:50.614 --> 01:10:51.579
Thank you, Jenny.

01:10:51.615 --> 01:10:52.714
Steve wants to come home

01:10:52.749 --> 01:10:54.315
and help add
his own special touches,

01:10:54.351 --> 01:10:55.661
but he can't leave
the baby and Hayley alone

01:10:55.685 --> 01:10:56.651
at the hospital.

01:10:56.686 --> 01:10:58.019
I'll go.

01:10:58.054 --> 01:10:59.354
I want to meet that baby!

01:10:59.389 --> 01:11:01.089
Do you think
you could give me a lift?

01:11:01.124 --> 01:11:02.223
Of course.

01:11:02.259 --> 01:11:04.759
Be sure to meet us at
the Kringlefest banquet, okay?

01:11:04.794 --> 01:11:05.526
- All right.
- Let's get started.

01:11:05.562 --> 01:11:07.395
- Let's go.
- Come on, everybody.

01:11:12.369 --> 01:11:14.035
She's so tiny and beautiful.

01:11:16.940 --> 01:11:17.905
Have you thought of a name yet?

01:11:17.941 --> 01:11:20.208
We're going to call her Eve,

01:11:20.243 --> 01:11:23.177
because she was
our Christmas Eve miracle!

01:11:23.213 --> 01:11:24.213
That's so perfect.

01:11:26.216 --> 01:11:27.693
I was going to wait
till the party to give you this,

01:11:27.717 --> 01:11:28.583
but...

01:11:28.618 --> 01:11:29.929
since you'll be
a bit pre-occupied...

01:11:29.953 --> 01:11:31.519
This is from the Secret Santa.

01:11:33.757 --> 01:11:35.056
Oh, my goodness.

01:11:37.460 --> 01:11:40.228
Thank you.
I love it.

01:11:40.263 --> 01:11:42.563
And then once you guys
are feeling up to it,

01:11:42.599 --> 01:11:44.399
I thought you could come
visit me in New York.

01:11:46.002 --> 01:11:47.002
Thank you.

01:11:55.578 --> 01:11:56.844
See Auntie Nell?

01:11:59.949 --> 01:12:02.083
I just can't
thank you guys enough.

01:12:02.118 --> 01:12:03.596
Hayley's going to think
this is so incredible.

01:12:03.620 --> 01:12:06.254
Steve, it was nothing.

01:12:06.289 --> 01:12:07.289
We're all family here.

01:12:07.324 --> 01:12:09.190
Whatever happens to one
happens to all of us.

01:12:10.460 --> 01:12:12.393
Yeah, thanks.

01:12:12.429 --> 01:12:14.395
Look, Emmett,

01:12:14.431 --> 01:12:16.075
I know you're probably
not going to want to hear this,

01:12:16.099 --> 01:12:18.566
but...

01:12:18.601 --> 01:12:19.534
I really think I've got
to accept Brad's offer.

01:12:19.569 --> 01:12:21.569
I mean, I can barely
keep my head above water

01:12:21.604 --> 01:12:22.570
at the store.

01:12:22.605 --> 01:12:23.805
And now with the baby...

01:12:23.840 --> 01:12:24.706
It's just...
it's a lot.

01:12:24.741 --> 01:12:26.441
I don't think I have
a choice either...

01:12:26.476 --> 01:12:28.276
the way things are going.

01:12:28.311 --> 01:12:29.488
I spoke with him this morning.

01:12:29.512 --> 01:12:32.447
He needs all of your properties
for his vision to work.

01:12:32.482 --> 01:12:34.148
- Are you serious?
- What does that mean?

01:12:34.184 --> 01:12:37.418
Well, if Emmett doesn't agree
to sell PaigeTurner,

01:12:37.454 --> 01:12:38.774
he might rescind
the other offers.

01:12:40.990 --> 01:12:42.256
Please, Emmett.

01:12:42.292 --> 01:12:43.257
We need this.

01:12:43.293 --> 01:12:46.461
I have Marnie
that I have to think of first.

01:12:46.496 --> 01:12:47.695
We know,

01:12:47.731 --> 01:12:49.464
but we don't know
what the future holds.

01:12:49.499 --> 01:12:50.976
I mean, as far as
what Marnie's going to do,

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:52.133
she may not know.

01:12:53.570 --> 01:12:55.269
Today, this is
a really good deal.

01:12:55.305 --> 01:12:56.671
If you invest it right,

01:12:56.706 --> 01:12:58.317
you could really set yourself
on the right foot.

01:12:58.341 --> 01:12:59.173
We all believe

01:12:59.209 --> 01:13:01.275
that this is what's best
for the town.

01:13:03.480 --> 01:13:04.680
This is what you really want?

01:13:05.648 --> 01:13:06.848
Yeah.

01:13:06.883 --> 01:13:07.883
All of you?

01:13:11.154 --> 01:13:12.854
All right,
I promise I'll consider it.

01:13:15.392 --> 01:13:16.758
Good day to you.

01:13:19.162 --> 01:13:21.429
What in the world?

01:13:31.040 --> 01:13:32.040
Who are they?

01:13:33.543 --> 01:13:34.809
That's Brad's team, I assume.

01:13:36.613 --> 01:13:38.824
I thought you said
Springdale went all out for Christmas.

01:13:38.848 --> 01:13:40.481
Exactly. They do.

01:13:40.517 --> 01:13:43.384
And we're just here to help
take it to the next level.

01:13:43.420 --> 01:13:44.652
Next level, Brad?

01:13:44.687 --> 01:13:46.154
This is kinda...

01:13:46.189 --> 01:13:47.189
Generic?

01:13:49.092 --> 01:13:51.359
This isn't how we usually
celebrate Kringlefest.

01:13:51.394 --> 01:13:52.760
What's it typically like?

01:13:52.796 --> 01:13:54.896
Do you want to see pictures
from last year?

01:13:54.931 --> 01:13:56.931
I have a whole bunch
of all the different events.

01:13:56.966 --> 01:13:58.599
Yeah, that would be great,

01:13:58.635 --> 01:13:59.745
because this doesn't
feel like Christmas.

01:13:59.769 --> 01:14:00.935
This is way too...

01:14:00.970 --> 01:14:02.737
polished.

01:14:02.772 --> 01:14:03.949
What am I missing, Brad?

01:14:03.973 --> 01:14:05.773
How do you plan
to sell Springdale

01:14:05.809 --> 01:14:07.675
as a unique way
to spend the holidays?

01:14:29.432 --> 01:14:30.698
- Excuse me?
- Hi.

01:14:30.733 --> 01:14:31.744
Can you ring Brad's room for me?

01:14:31.768 --> 01:14:33.201
I'm sorry.

01:14:33.236 --> 01:14:34.516
Mr. Hathaway
already checked out.

01:14:35.805 --> 01:14:36.771
Thank you.

01:14:36.806 --> 01:14:38.072
No problem.

01:14:51.120 --> 01:14:52.120
Nell, you made it!

01:14:53.623 --> 01:14:55.089
Hi.

01:14:55.124 --> 01:14:56.124
I have something for you.

01:14:57.760 --> 01:14:59.171
We aren't doing
the Secret Santa exchange

01:14:59.195 --> 01:15:00.261
until later.

01:15:00.296 --> 01:15:01.596
It's not for Secret Santa.

01:15:01.631 --> 01:15:02.697
That's from me to you.

01:15:04.133 --> 01:15:05.244
Merry Christmas, sweetheart.

01:15:05.268 --> 01:15:06.367
Thanks, Nell!

01:15:09.272 --> 01:15:11.606
I'll open it tomorrow
for Christmas morning.

01:15:11.641 --> 01:15:12.641
Sounds good.

01:15:12.675 --> 01:15:14.108
I'm so glad you stayed.

01:15:14.143 --> 01:15:15.576
Me too.

01:15:16.779 --> 01:15:18.913
The two of you drive
a very hard bargain,

01:15:18.948 --> 01:15:21.182
but I am willing to increase...

01:15:21.217 --> 01:15:22.937
I'll come find you
in a few minutes, okay?

01:15:23.820 --> 01:15:24.820
Moment of truth.

01:15:30.693 --> 01:15:32.026
All right.

01:15:32.061 --> 01:15:33.160
I'll sell.

01:15:33.196 --> 01:15:34.556
You've made
a very wise decision.

01:15:35.665 --> 01:15:37.109
If you could just sign there
at the bottom,

01:15:37.133 --> 01:15:38.432
you're good to go.

01:15:41.504 --> 01:15:43.148
I thought you said there were
more important things

01:15:43.172 --> 01:15:44.138
than dollars and cents.

01:15:44.173 --> 01:15:45.173
How could you do this?

01:15:46.142 --> 01:15:47.008
Just because.

01:15:47.043 --> 01:15:48.354
It's just the best choice
for everybody.

01:15:48.378 --> 01:15:49.378
No, it's not.

01:15:50.747 --> 01:15:52.313
What would Paige think?

01:15:52.348 --> 01:15:54.315
Your store isn't just
a place to buy books.

01:15:54.350 --> 01:15:56.951
It's a place people can gather
as a community.

01:15:56.986 --> 01:15:59.287
I thought it meant
more to you than money.

01:15:59.322 --> 01:16:02.056
If you're so concerned
about Springdale,

01:16:02.091 --> 01:16:03.724
why did you wait six years
to come here?

01:16:03.760 --> 01:16:05.459
Maybe I would have come sooner,

01:16:05.495 --> 01:16:06.961
if I had heard from you,
even once,

01:16:06.996 --> 01:16:08.229
since you left New York.

01:16:08.264 --> 01:16:09.308
- Hold on.
- No, you hold on.

01:16:09.332 --> 01:16:10.565
And before you sign anything,

01:16:10.600 --> 01:16:12.320
you should see what Brad
really has planned.

01:16:13.670 --> 01:16:17.371
It's none my business,
but this town deserves better.

01:16:17.407 --> 01:16:18.839
Have a Merry Christmas, Emmett.

01:16:20.343 --> 01:16:22.510
Nell... Nell...

01:16:30.620 --> 01:16:32.731
The deal was that you were
going to leave my store intact.

01:16:32.755 --> 01:16:34.956
All our stores.

01:16:34.991 --> 01:16:36.757
I underestimated
the number of tourists

01:16:36.793 --> 01:16:38.704
that are going to want to come
to Springdale next Christmas,

01:16:38.728 --> 01:16:40.928
so in order to keep up
with my projections,

01:16:40.964 --> 01:16:43.030
you're going to need
a major overhaul.

01:16:44.267 --> 01:16:46.045
I'm sorry, Brad,
but I'm not going to do it.

01:16:46.069 --> 01:16:48.736
I'm not going to let him
destroy Paige's legacy.

01:16:48.771 --> 01:16:49.737
Please be reasonable.

01:16:49.772 --> 01:16:50.892
Will you forgive me, Jenny?

01:16:51.975 --> 01:16:52.907
Sorry, Brad.

01:16:52.942 --> 01:16:55.443
You guys are making
a very big mistake here.

01:16:58.281 --> 01:16:59.246
The deal's off, Brad.

01:16:59.282 --> 01:17:00.581
That is so much money.

01:17:01.684 --> 01:17:02.883
Call Nell Phillips.

01:17:09.125 --> 01:17:10.091
Hi.

01:17:10.126 --> 01:17:11.792
<i>Hey, Nell.
Merry Christmas Eve.</i>

01:17:11.828 --> 01:17:12.760
Merry Christmas Eve to you, too.

01:17:12.795 --> 01:17:13.761
How are you guys feeling?

01:17:13.796 --> 01:17:14.962
We're hanging in there.

01:17:16.299 --> 01:17:17.543
Are you enjoying
your Springdale Christmas?

01:17:17.567 --> 01:17:20.534
I don't belong here.

01:17:20.570 --> 01:17:22.770
It's time I get back
to New York,

01:17:22.805 --> 01:17:23.805
where my real life is.

01:17:23.840 --> 01:17:26.273
What? On Christmas Eve?

01:17:26.309 --> 01:17:27.475
I'll call you when I land.

01:17:28.678 --> 01:17:29.810
Oh, Nell.

01:17:31.147 --> 01:17:32.313
Bye.

01:17:52.068 --> 01:17:53.467
I really wanted Nell to be here.

01:17:53.503 --> 01:17:55.803
I know, kiddo.
Me too.

01:17:55.838 --> 01:17:57.878
But we're still going to have
fun anyway, aren't we?

01:17:58.441 --> 01:18:01.108
And the next gift
goes to Emmett.

01:18:04.113 --> 01:18:06.247
That's for me.

01:18:06.282 --> 01:18:08.215
All right.
Let's see what we've got.

01:18:08.251 --> 01:18:10.184
"To Emmett.
Love, Secret Santa".

01:18:11.954 --> 01:18:15.056
"The Adventures of Uncle Emmett
and Marnie".

01:18:16.225 --> 01:18:17.525
Can you guess who it's from?

01:18:17.560 --> 01:18:18.659
I have a hunch.

01:18:18.695 --> 01:18:20.572
I think this is going to be
a national best-seller.

01:18:20.596 --> 01:18:21.862
Thank you.

01:18:24.200 --> 01:18:25.266
Nell helped.

01:18:25.301 --> 01:18:26.934
I made it,
but she gave me the idea.

01:18:26.969 --> 01:18:29.303
She did, huh?

01:18:30.473 --> 01:18:32.106
You know what,
you just gave me an idea.

01:18:32.141 --> 01:18:33.074
Will you watch Marnie
for a minute?

01:18:33.109 --> 01:18:34.109
I'll be right back.

01:18:34.143 --> 01:18:36.377
Of course.

01:18:36.412 --> 01:18:37.892
All right, kiddo,
let's see this book.

01:19:03.506 --> 01:19:04.338
I'm...

01:19:04.373 --> 01:19:06.807
I'm really sorry
for wasting your time.

01:19:06.843 --> 01:19:08.109
Are you kidding?

01:19:08.144 --> 01:19:09.443
We've been so caught up

01:19:09.479 --> 01:19:11.045
in how to capitalize
on towns like this,

01:19:11.080 --> 01:19:14.315
that we forgot what actually
makes them special.

01:19:14.350 --> 01:19:15.928
We needed this dose
of the real Christmas sprit

01:19:15.952 --> 01:19:17.152
to see what is more important.

01:19:18.488 --> 01:19:19.587
I'll tell you what,

01:19:19.622 --> 01:19:20.966
let's set up a meeting
with the mayor in the new year

01:19:20.990 --> 01:19:22.590
to discuss how we can help out...

01:19:22.625 --> 01:19:23.591
the Springdale way.

01:19:23.626 --> 01:19:25.025
Yeah. I'd love that.

01:19:26.763 --> 01:19:28.562
Hey, can I hitch a ride
back to the airport?

01:19:28.598 --> 01:19:29.563
I mean, if we leave now,

01:19:29.599 --> 01:19:31.359
then we can still
make it back for Christmas.

01:19:33.002 --> 01:19:34.301
- Sure.
- Thanks, guys.

01:19:36.672 --> 01:19:38.906
- Hey, Scott, Merry Christmas.
- Hey.

01:19:38.941 --> 01:19:41.175
I'm here to see Nell.
Can you ring her room for me?

01:19:41.210 --> 01:19:42.421
I'm afraid you just missed her.

01:19:42.445 --> 01:19:43.965
She just checked out
a few minutes ago.

01:19:47.650 --> 01:19:49.784
She just checked out...

01:19:49.819 --> 01:19:51.118
All right.
Bye-bye.

01:20:05.401 --> 01:20:06.401
Hey, Nell.

01:20:13.309 --> 01:20:14.441
What happened?

01:20:14.477 --> 01:20:15.810
I ran over a pothole.

01:20:15.845 --> 01:20:17.178
You all right?

01:20:17.213 --> 01:20:18.991
Yeah, I'm fine.
What are you doing here?

01:20:19.015 --> 01:20:20.681
I wanted to say thank you.

01:20:22.385 --> 01:20:23.651
I think...

01:20:23.686 --> 01:20:24.952
that you saved the day,

01:20:24.987 --> 01:20:25.786
and you stopped us from making

01:20:25.822 --> 01:20:27.102
the biggest mistake
of our lives.

01:20:28.324 --> 01:20:29.223
You didn't sell?

01:20:29.258 --> 01:20:30.624
No.

01:20:33.596 --> 01:20:34.628
Nell, I'm sorry.

01:20:34.664 --> 01:20:37.565
I'm sorry that I left
New York City so suddenly.

01:20:37.600 --> 01:20:38.632
I should have called you

01:20:38.668 --> 01:20:40.835
and given you the explanation
that you deserved,

01:20:40.870 --> 01:20:42.069
but I was so sad.

01:20:42.104 --> 01:20:43.470
And I was overwhelmed.

01:20:46.008 --> 01:20:46.874
And writing you that letter...

01:20:46.909 --> 01:20:48.375
Letter?

01:20:48.411 --> 01:20:49.411
What letter?

01:20:51.280 --> 01:20:54.048
The letter I sent you
a few months after I left.

01:20:54.083 --> 01:20:55.149
I didn't get a letter.

01:20:56.419 --> 01:20:57.351
Where did you send it?

01:20:57.386 --> 01:20:59.053
To the office.

01:20:59.088 --> 01:21:01.555
Emmett, I left that office
about a month after you did.

01:21:01.591 --> 01:21:03.524
Oh, my gosh.

01:21:03.559 --> 01:21:05.259
And they didn't
forward it to you?

01:21:05.294 --> 01:21:06.727
No.

01:21:06.762 --> 01:21:08.202
You didn't get the letter?

01:21:08.231 --> 01:21:09.897
Do you want to know
what it said?

01:21:09.932 --> 01:21:11.632
I don't care what it said.

01:21:13.202 --> 01:21:14.235
I know why you left

01:21:14.270 --> 01:21:17.838
and I have all the respect
in the world for you.

01:21:17.874 --> 01:21:20.040
I know that must have been hard.

01:21:20.076 --> 01:21:23.077
What matters is you're here now.

01:21:23.112 --> 01:21:24.845
That's all I care about.

01:21:24.881 --> 01:21:25.881
End of story.

01:21:29.118 --> 01:21:31.285
You know...

01:21:31.320 --> 01:21:33.265
I still would really like
to take you on that date.

01:21:33.289 --> 01:21:34.989
Can I get a rain check?

01:21:36.726 --> 01:21:37.758
I don't know...

01:21:37.793 --> 01:21:39.960
That rain check's long expired.

01:21:39.996 --> 01:21:41.795
Yeah?

01:21:41.831 --> 01:21:43.271
You might
have to ask me out again.

01:21:43.299 --> 01:21:45.299
All right.

01:21:45.334 --> 01:21:46.967
Nell Phillips...

01:21:47.003 --> 01:21:48.502
would you go on a date with me?

01:21:53.309 --> 01:21:54.875
I'm going to take that as a yes.

01:21:54.911 --> 01:21:56.176
It's a yes.

01:22:09.825 --> 01:22:11.458
Knock-knock.
Anybody home?

01:22:12.528 --> 01:22:13.594
Merry Christmas!

01:22:13.629 --> 01:22:15.896
- Look who it is.
- Merry Christmas.

01:22:15.932 --> 01:22:17.331
Did Santa come?

01:22:17.366 --> 01:22:19.900
You better believe did. Hi.
Good morning.

01:22:21.203 --> 01:22:23.137
Good morning.

01:22:23.172 --> 01:22:24.805
I saved this one for last.

01:22:28.778 --> 01:22:31.912
It's a locket!
Just like yours.

01:22:31.948 --> 01:22:33.525
I thought you could keep
your treasures with you.

01:22:33.549 --> 01:22:35.049
Thanks, Nell.

01:22:36.185 --> 01:22:37.945
- You're welcome.
- It's beautiful.

01:22:39.455 --> 01:22:42.823
Who even knew we had one left?

01:22:42.858 --> 01:22:44.191
But who do you think it's for?

01:22:44.226 --> 01:22:45.492
Does it say?

01:22:45.528 --> 01:22:46.939
It looks like
a Secret Santa for Nell.

01:22:46.963 --> 01:22:48.429
For me?

01:22:49.966 --> 01:22:50.966
What is this?

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:53.133
Let's see what we've got.

01:22:59.408 --> 01:23:00.374
It's perfect!

01:23:00.409 --> 01:23:01.442
Do you like it?

01:23:01.477 --> 01:23:02.843
I love it.
Thank you.

01:23:06.816 --> 01:23:08.293
- Did you make this?
- I did make it, yeah.

01:23:08.317 --> 01:23:09.695
With a little help
from Mrs. Ferguson.

01:23:09.719 --> 01:23:11.051
Okay, okay.
That's what it is.

01:23:11.087 --> 01:23:13.220
And Marnie.

01:23:13.255 --> 01:23:15.489
And, Marnie, what else
did you get from Santa?

01:23:16.305 --> 01:23:22.164
