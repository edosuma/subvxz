00:51.308 --> 00:56.844
If you're watching this, you've
discovered something you shouldn't have.

01:04.053 --> 01:05.887
Anyway, um...

01:07.757 --> 01:12.994
This... This is a close-up
of a model's eye.

01:13.128 --> 01:15.830
Yeah. I can't remember her
name to save my life,

01:15.832 --> 01:19.100
but she had the bluest eyes
I've ever seen.

01:19.102 --> 01:23.938
The only other time I remember seeing
this exact intensity of blue...

01:23.940 --> 01:26.874
was the day my sister drowned.

01:26.876 --> 01:28.076
It was everywhere.

01:28.078 --> 01:32.747
It was in the water,
in the sky, Nicole's skin.

01:32.749 --> 01:35.283
Blue.
I remember.

01:35.551 --> 01:36.551
And gold.

01:36.553 --> 01:39.821
The gold of the light
off the surface of the water.

01:39.823 --> 01:44.158
Like an empty frame
flashing onto the screen.

01:45.728 --> 01:47.295
Nicole.

01:47.297 --> 01:50.031
She's the one girl
I keep trying to remember.

01:50.033 --> 01:53.234
But I... I think
she's the problem.

01:53.236 --> 01:59.007
I think she's the reason
I am the way I am, right?

03:39.708 --> 03:44.679
Maybe I should back up and try to
explain what the hell happened here.

03:45.180 --> 03:49.450
<i>Jesus Christ. What the
hell did happen here?</i>

03:49.452 --> 03:50.918
<i>Um...</i>

03:50.920 --> 03:53.688
Well, let's start with me.

03:53.690 --> 03:55.723
My name is Kevin Wolfe.

03:55.725 --> 03:56.891
I'm a studio photographer.

03:56.893 --> 04:02.029
I do head shots, and most
of my clients are girls.

04:02.031 --> 04:03.764
Girls.

04:04.199 --> 04:06.734
They've sort of been the focus
of my whole fucking life.

04:06.736 --> 04:08.002
They're sort of
a problem for me.

04:08.004 --> 04:11.739
I've just been trying to find a way
to forget all the bad experiences...

04:11.741 --> 04:14.475
and try to have
at least one good one, so...

04:14.477 --> 04:16.844
every girl that comes
into this studio...

04:16.846 --> 04:20.848
every actress, every model...

04:20.850 --> 04:22.283
I ask out.

04:22.285 --> 04:24.719
Would you like to see a movie?

04:24.721 --> 04:26.921
And they almost always say...

04:26.923 --> 04:28.689
No.

04:28.691 --> 04:31.125
And so, I do
this forgetting thing.

04:31.127 --> 04:32.059
It's like a ritual.

04:32.061 --> 04:35.663
I mean, I know it sounds weird, but
you gotta do something positive...

04:35.665 --> 04:39.967
to cancel out the negative
experiences, right?

04:39.969 --> 04:41.969
Um, for instance,

04:41.971 --> 04:45.840
I forgot Theresa
by going to Coney Island.

04:45.842 --> 04:48.476
And before Theresa
there was Carrie,

04:48.478 --> 04:50.645
who decided to stand me up
at the movies.

04:50.647 --> 04:55.917
<i>Forgot her by watching every
single episode of Lost on DVD.</i>

04:56.952 --> 05:00.121
And then, uh...

05:00.556 --> 05:01.989
Then there was Sheila.

05:01.991 --> 05:03.724
She was a real girl, you know?

05:03.726 --> 05:05.793
Not like most actresses...
not fake.

05:05.795 --> 05:10.264
Although she does look
really overdone here.

05:10.266 --> 05:11.332
My assistant Jamie,

05:11.334 --> 05:13.801
she sometimes went
a little crazy with the makeup.

05:13.803 --> 05:17.338
Anyway, I remember asking...
Are you single?

05:17.340 --> 05:21.042
Um, I'm only 19.

05:21.044 --> 05:22.577
Oh.

05:22.579 --> 05:27.281
Um, do you have
a... a boyfriend?

05:27.283 --> 05:30.084
Oh, no. No, I don't.

05:30.086 --> 05:33.921
Maybe we could go
to a-a movie sometime?

05:34.289 --> 05:37.158
Uh...

05:37.926 --> 05:39.126
Sure.

05:39.128 --> 05:41.996
Yeah. Uh, sure.
Um...

05:41.998 --> 05:44.165
I... I like movies.

05:44.167 --> 05:47.235
A lot of girls have
a hard time saying no,

05:47.237 --> 05:50.204
especially if they're from Iowa
or some fucking place.

05:50.206 --> 05:52.106
It's like they're trying
to be polite all the time.

05:52.108 --> 05:55.176
But, anyway, she called the day
we were supposed to go out...

05:55.178 --> 05:56.510
and she said she'd forgotten
about other plans.

05:56.512 --> 06:01.582
Some relative was in from out of town, I
think, or something, blah, blah, blah.

06:01.584 --> 06:04.252
I forgot her
by going to the newsstand.

06:04.254 --> 06:06.721
Flipping through
the fashion magazines,

06:06.723 --> 06:09.657
the pictures of
the skinny supermodels,

06:09.659 --> 06:13.861
the emaciated and beautiful.

06:14.963 --> 06:21.602
And then, uh, there are the ones
who are not so easy to forget...

06:21.604 --> 06:24.505
because they are the ones
who said...

06:24.507 --> 06:26.307
Yes.

06:26.309 --> 06:28.109
Okay.

06:36.485 --> 06:38.152
This looks great.
Thanks.

06:38.154 --> 06:41.055
It's a great smile.

06:42.324 --> 06:44.425
Have you done a lot of acting?

06:44.427 --> 06:46.594
I mean, theater or...

06:46.596 --> 06:50.231
Um, a few years ago,
I went on some auditions.

06:50.233 --> 06:52.633
And then I met this guy,

06:52.635 --> 06:54.802
and... now I'm a hostess.

06:54.804 --> 06:59.373
But I'm planning on
getting back into it.

07:00.509 --> 07:03.344
How old are you?

07:03.346 --> 07:04.912
How old am I?

07:04.914 --> 07:08.649
Why do you want to know
how old I am?

07:09.818 --> 07:11.819
Where'd you grow up?

07:11.821 --> 07:13.621
Who said I ever grew up?

07:13.623 --> 07:15.656
Oh.

07:15.658 --> 07:17.191
Well, where'd you go to school?

07:17.193 --> 07:21.629
You know, usually, how this works is that
I'm usually the one asking questions.

07:21.631 --> 07:23.064
Oh.

07:23.066 --> 07:26.434
What are you doing tonight?

07:27.202 --> 07:29.103
What am I doing?

07:29.105 --> 07:32.273
Do you want to go out
with me, Kevin?

07:32.641 --> 07:34.775
Oh, like what?
Like a movie?

07:34.777 --> 07:38.946
I was thinking more like a bar.

07:40.015 --> 07:42.383
Okay.

07:52.361 --> 07:54.362
Kevin.

07:59.668 --> 08:02.503
I had a bad dream.

09:00.530 --> 09:02.930
Oh, my God.

09:04.332 --> 09:09.270
- Good morning.
- Are you taking pictures of me?

09:09.272 --> 09:11.172
Taking one picture.
Here.

09:11.174 --> 09:13.374
See? You look beautiful.

09:13.376 --> 09:15.443
Not likely.
Yeah, you do.

09:15.445 --> 09:18.746
Oh, God.

09:20.282 --> 09:22.583
What time is it?

09:28.990 --> 09:29.990
Oh, my God.

09:29.992 --> 09:32.860
I don't want you to get
the wrong idea about me.

09:32.862 --> 09:35.262
Get the wrong idea?

09:35.264 --> 09:38.098
What wrong idea?

09:38.100 --> 09:39.867
Um...

09:41.603 --> 09:45.306
Yeah. I mean, I can't
believe that I, like...

09:45.308 --> 09:47.308
Listen, I'm not, uh...

09:47.310 --> 09:51.212
I'm not the type of person
that just wants to...

09:51.214 --> 09:53.814
Uh, fuck.

09:53.816 --> 09:58.886
Listen, I know that... I know that I
really don't know you at all, Adrienne.

09:58.888 --> 10:01.989
I can't even think of your
last name at the moment.

10:01.991 --> 10:05.192
But... And it's safe to say
that you don't know me,

10:05.194 --> 10:06.861
but...

10:06.863 --> 10:10.130
I really feel
that we made this...

10:10.132 --> 10:12.099
this connection.

10:12.101 --> 10:13.901
Right?

10:14.669 --> 10:16.670
Uh, a connection?
Yeah.

10:16.672 --> 10:19.773
I mean, you're here, I'm here,

10:19.775 --> 10:24.645
and I just feel like there's this...
there's a spark.

10:24.647 --> 10:28.649
I mean, what I want,
really, is just...

10:29.651 --> 10:30.851
I just want a girl, you know?

10:30.853 --> 10:35.089
I mean, I'm just a guy. I mean, I'm
not, like, a fashion photographer.

10:35.091 --> 10:37.992
It's nothing glamorous.
I just do head shots, you know...

10:37.994 --> 10:41.295
300 a digital set,
prints are extra.

10:41.297 --> 10:44.532
It's the deal I gave
you, essentially. Yeah.

10:44.534 --> 10:46.433
Um, hey, listen.

10:46.435 --> 10:52.706
Yesterday was, like,
a really, um, weird day for me.

10:53.808 --> 10:55.609
So...

10:55.611 --> 10:58.112
Mmm.
Yeah.

10:58.114 --> 10:59.914
Okay.

11:00.115 --> 11:02.082
Sh... Coffee?
Do you want coffee?

11:02.084 --> 11:04.885
I could go down to the corner...
No, thanks.

11:04.887 --> 11:06.787
No, thanks.

11:07.455 --> 11:09.490
You have to go to work?

11:09.492 --> 11:11.825
Work. Yeah, I do.
Work.

11:11.827 --> 11:15.596
Can I, um... Can I
call you sometime?

11:15.598 --> 11:19.867
Um, did I give you my number?

11:22.737 --> 11:24.605
Oh. Wow.

11:24.607 --> 11:26.774
Uh, yeah, you gave it
to Jamie on the card...

11:26.776 --> 11:32.313
so that I could call you when the
pictures were ready. Oh! Right, right.

11:36.151 --> 11:39.520
Awkward.
Okay.

11:39.522 --> 11:41.355
Thanks!

11:43.892 --> 11:46.060
Fuck. Fucking fuck.

11:46.062 --> 11:48.729
I am such a fucking idiot.
Oh, my God.

11:48.731 --> 11:51.932
Oh, my God. I can't
believe how stupid I am.

11:53.235 --> 11:57.237
No idea how to talk to people...
girls in particular.

11:58.274 --> 12:01.609
Hi. I really think we had
this connection, right?

12:01.611 --> 12:05.879
Hi! We have a connection.
I really think, uh...

12:22.597 --> 12:24.632
Stupid. I'm so fucking stupid.
I'm stupid.

12:24.634 --> 12:29.403
I'm such a fucking moron. I'm such
a fucking dumb-ass piece of shit.

12:29.405 --> 12:32.006
Fucking brain...

12:33.708 --> 12:35.676
Hey.

12:35.678 --> 12:37.444
Hi.

12:38.279 --> 12:40.714
Do you wanna go camping?

12:40.716 --> 12:42.483
Uh, Derek and me were...

12:42.485 --> 12:46.620
Derek and I are going camping,
and we want you to go.

12:46.622 --> 12:52.092
And I was thinking you could do
some of your nature photography.

12:53.395 --> 12:57.831
You know, if you don't want
to, that is totally fine.

12:57.833 --> 12:59.933
Please tell me
you're kidding, right?

12:59.935 --> 13:03.170
Yeah. I was kidding.
You're kidding.

13:03.172 --> 13:05.839
Yeah. I got you.
You got me.

13:05.841 --> 13:09.977
I'm going to go set up now.
Okay.

14:09.003 --> 14:12.339
Do you have any pictures
to show me?

14:12.341 --> 14:14.108
Nah.

14:14.442 --> 14:16.543
You never show me your pictures.

14:16.545 --> 14:19.012
They're just girls.

14:19.014 --> 14:21.014
They're just...
head shots.

14:21.016 --> 14:25.152
They're boring, Ruby.
They'd bore you.

14:25.553 --> 14:28.355
Girls are nice.

14:28.623 --> 14:30.858
You wouldn't like 'em.
Trust me, Ruby.

14:30.860 --> 14:33.127
You wouldn't like any of 'em.

14:33.129 --> 14:35.929
They're not dirty pictures,
are they?

14:36.197 --> 14:37.197
Come on.

14:37.199 --> 14:41.368
I've seen those magazines. I know what all
kinds of pictures they have out there.

14:41.370 --> 14:43.804
They're not dirty.
You're taking dirty pictures!

14:43.806 --> 14:49.176
You are crazy, Ruby.
You are a crazy old woman.

14:49.377 --> 14:53.847
You shouldn't call me Ruby.
You should call me Grandma.

14:55.850 --> 14:59.353
Ruby, can I see
the pictures of Nicole?

15:11.599 --> 15:14.201
She wasn't supposed to be
called "Nicole," you know,

15:14.203 --> 15:17.471
because that was
your mother's name.

15:17.473 --> 15:19.106
I know.

15:19.108 --> 15:23.043
But when she died,
we thought it was fitting.

15:23.211 --> 15:27.247
Just a newborn baby,
and a little girl and all.

15:27.249 --> 15:29.783
Such a pretty little baby.

15:29.785 --> 15:33.921
It was fitting she should
have your mother's name.

15:33.923 --> 15:35.055
Oh, your mother...

15:35.057 --> 15:39.560
I guess it was just
one of those things.

15:39.562 --> 15:43.530
They said they
couldn't have known.

15:44.098 --> 15:49.102
And I thought I could console
myself with little Nicole.

15:51.706 --> 15:54.675
You're all I've got left.

17:03.011 --> 17:05.145
Fuck.

17:05.713 --> 17:09.182
It's not that you're
a bad guy or anything.

17:09.184 --> 17:12.853
I mean, you seem like
you're really nice.

17:12.855 --> 17:14.954
It's just...
I don't know...

17:14.957 --> 17:18.258
like you seem
kind of like, um...

17:19.527 --> 17:23.130
You know, like, with
the whole connection thing?

17:24.165 --> 17:28.068
And then, plus, the mood
that I was in when we...

17:28.435 --> 17:34.741
You know, um, I was kind of
acting something out.

17:34.743 --> 17:37.344
I mean, you... you asked
me out, you know.

17:37.346 --> 17:40.047
Why would you ask me out?
I mean, I don't...

17:40.049 --> 17:41.348
I'm sorry.

17:41.350 --> 17:45.285
It's not something that you
should do lightly, you know.

17:48.790 --> 17:51.758
You know what?
Thank you for the head shots.

17:51.760 --> 17:55.062
I, uh... Yeah, I have some, uh, extra
prints in here, if you want them.

17:55.064 --> 17:59.433
And I ended up using one of
them, actually, for my flyer.

17:59.435 --> 18:01.068
I hope that doesn't bother you.

18:01.070 --> 18:04.571
Oh, no, it's fine.
And these are fine.

18:04.573 --> 18:05.839
Yeah.
Um...

18:05.841 --> 18:09.109
It is fine. It's gonna be fine.
It's totally fine.

18:09.111 --> 18:12.045
It's, uh... Don't even
feel bad about it.

18:12.047 --> 18:14.381
You know, I know a lot of girls.

18:14.383 --> 18:16.650
Um, it's just...

18:16.918 --> 18:19.686
I felt... I felt like
we had a, uh...

18:19.688 --> 18:21.588
Hey, Kevin.

18:23.424 --> 18:25.993
I'm sorry.

18:28.262 --> 18:29.262
Me too.

18:29.264 --> 18:33.166
You know when you're in a museum
and you're looking at a painting,

18:33.168 --> 18:35.702
and it's really
freaking you out?

18:35.704 --> 18:39.306
It's all jagged and awful,
and it gets inside you?

18:39.308 --> 18:43.910
Then you just turn your head
and walk through the door...

18:43.912 --> 18:46.980
into another room of the museum,

18:46.982 --> 18:48.849
and you're looking
at another painting...

18:48.851 --> 18:55.288
a calculation of colors, abstract
and meaningless, but beautiful.

18:55.290 --> 18:57.491
So beautiful.

18:57.493 --> 18:59.960
Just waiting for you...

18:59.962 --> 19:03.196
if you just walk through.

19:12.173 --> 19:13.173
Hi.

19:13.175 --> 19:15.642
Uh, my name's Kevin Wolfe.
I'm a studio photographer.

19:15.644 --> 19:19.446
I do head shots, $300 a digital set.
Prints are extra.

19:19.448 --> 19:22.282
You've probably
seen my flyers...

19:22.284 --> 19:23.784
all over the city?

19:23.786 --> 19:26.920
No? Sounds like you've said
that a few times before.

19:26.922 --> 19:31.091
Yeah, I think I even
say it in my sleep.

19:31.093 --> 19:33.226
Well, I mean, it's okay
if you haven't seen 'em.

19:33.228 --> 19:37.030
It's probably not something
you'd pay attention to anyway.

19:37.131 --> 19:40.667
I mean, unless, of course, you know,
you wanted to get head shots, right?

19:40.669 --> 19:42.702
I mean, are you, uh, an actor?

19:42.704 --> 19:46.073
Yeah, uh, actually, I need some.

19:46.075 --> 19:47.874
Yeah?

19:49.210 --> 19:50.644
I'm Beth.

19:50.646 --> 19:53.046
Beth, uh...
Beth Dalewell.

19:53.048 --> 19:55.248
Beth Dalewell.

19:55.250 --> 19:58.151
Are you, uh, enjoying
the play so far?

19:58.153 --> 20:02.122
Yeah. Uh, so far
it's all right.

20:02.124 --> 20:04.691
Just all right?
Yeah.

20:04.693 --> 20:07.327
I don't know. It's kind of
embarrassing, isn't it?

20:07.329 --> 20:11.565
I mean, the guy's walking around in
white tights pretending to be a swan.

20:11.567 --> 20:14.334
I don't know. We're actually
supposed to believe he is one.

20:14.336 --> 20:14.836
Yeah.

20:20.308 --> 20:24.010
Did... Did you produce it
or something?

20:24.012 --> 20:25.912
Oh, no. No, no, no.
I mean...

20:25.914 --> 20:29.116
I did the head shots
for someone in that cast.

20:29.118 --> 20:32.619
Yep. And plus, I'm just
a fan of the theater.

20:34.455 --> 20:36.957
Oh, fuck. I can't believe
I just said that.

20:36.959 --> 20:40.961
"I'm a fan of the theater."

20:40.963 --> 20:42.696
"The theater."

20:42.698 --> 20:44.865
I'm sorry.
I'm just an idiot.

20:44.867 --> 20:47.834
No, you're...
you're funny.

20:47.836 --> 20:49.836
I'm funny? What do you...
What do you mean?

20:49.838 --> 20:53.473
I don't know. You're just...
You're just funny.

20:55.611 --> 20:57.377
So...

21:16.797 --> 21:21.168
Are you, um,
coming from Kevin's?

21:21.170 --> 21:24.871
Uh, yeah. Just picking
up some head shots.

21:24.873 --> 21:26.706
Photos.

21:29.143 --> 21:31.011
Are you an actress?

21:31.013 --> 21:33.980
I'd like to be.

21:38.519 --> 21:40.921
What do you do?

21:41.689 --> 21:43.557
Nothing.

21:43.559 --> 21:45.959
Really?

21:45.961 --> 21:50.897
I'm sort of the...
the landlord.

21:50.899 --> 21:52.866
Oh.

21:55.836 --> 21:58.872
I feel like I'm just like this
worthless piece of shit...

21:58.874 --> 22:02.042
that, like, exists in the world
for absolutely no reason.

22:02.044 --> 22:06.079
And, like, I should just essentially be
dead, and everyone would be happier.

22:06.081 --> 22:07.948
Like everyone else
has a reason to be alive,

22:07.950 --> 22:12.852
and I'm just, like, this worthless
failure that has no... point.

22:12.854 --> 22:14.354
Okay, Jamie.
James. Listen.

22:14.356 --> 22:15.622
I look in the mirror,
and I'm just like...

22:15.624 --> 22:19.526
I just feel like I'm so ugly
and hideous, and I...

22:19.528 --> 22:23.463
Jamie, listen. You're not hideous, Jamie.
You're not ugly at all.

22:23.465 --> 22:26.132
Will you... Will you stop
being so negative?

22:26.134 --> 22:27.467
<i>Why don't you try
being positive?</i>

22:27.469 --> 22:30.036
<i>Think about... Think about anything.
I know, Derek.</i>

22:30.038 --> 22:34.107
I know it is your job
to talk me down, okay?

22:34.109 --> 22:36.443
And...

22:36.445 --> 22:40.046
I'm not gonna
drink anything, okay?

22:40.048 --> 22:42.716
And thank you, you know?
Thank you.

22:42.718 --> 22:44.818
You're like my only friend
in the entire world,

22:44.820 --> 22:48.555
and that is why I call you,
because you're nice, you know?

22:48.557 --> 22:52.659
You're a very, very,
very nice sponsor.

22:52.661 --> 22:55.662
I'm really gla...
Can you hold on?

22:55.664 --> 22:58.198
I have another call.

23:00.668 --> 23:02.802
Hi, honey.

23:04.839 --> 23:07.207
<i>Hi, Mom. I didn't
interrupt anything?</i>

23:07.209 --> 23:09.643
<i>No. I can call you
back if you want.</i>

23:09.645 --> 23:10.777
<i>No.
What are you doing?</i>

23:10.779 --> 23:14.714
I was just on the other line
with the suicide hotline, so...

23:14.716 --> 23:17.384
<i>Really? Yeah. They
said I should do it.</i>

23:17.386 --> 23:19.919
<i>Oh, my God, Jamie. Are you okay?
I'm kidding.</i>

23:19.921 --> 23:22.656
<i>I'm kidding, Mom. Why would
you scare me like that?</i>

23:22.658 --> 23:24.824
Can you please
hold on for a second?

23:24.826 --> 23:26.626
The swan started crying,
you know?

23:26.628 --> 23:30.830
The dancing was one thing,
and then... and then, yeah.

24:24.752 --> 24:25.752
Hi.
Hey.

24:25.754 --> 24:28.521
So, I still need you to get
me a key for the downstairs,

24:28.523 --> 24:31.391
and then you wouldn't have to buzz
me in every time I come to work.

24:31.393 --> 24:33.927
I don't mind it, but since I
already have the upstairs key,

24:33.929 --> 24:36.396
and I know it bothers you... I
keep forgetting about that.

24:36.398 --> 24:38.798
Would you mind making
some coffee, please? Yes.

24:38.800 --> 24:42.001
So... you know how I was
telling you Derek is gay?

24:42.003 --> 24:46.673
I know you knew he was gay, but all
of my best friends are always gay.

24:46.675 --> 24:49.542
"Fag hag." That's what they
used to call me in high school.

24:49.544 --> 24:51.378
Because my best friend
was gay... Tony.

24:51.380 --> 24:52.612
Oh, my God.
You would like Tony.

24:52.614 --> 24:55.682
The weird thing is is that I
have never known any lesbians.

24:55.684 --> 24:57.584
I mean, I don't think
I'd get along with one.

24:57.586 --> 24:59.152
Although, who's to judge?
I don't know.

24:59.154 --> 25:01.454
Maybe I've known a lot of
lesbians and didn't know. God.

25:01.456 --> 25:04.991
If I was friends with lesbians in high school,
they couldn't have called me "fag hag."

25:04.993 --> 25:09.996
They'd have to call me something
else like "lesbi-friend."

25:09.998 --> 25:11.631
Oh, shit.

25:11.633 --> 25:13.600
You didn't think, a minute ago,

25:13.602 --> 25:15.769
that I was saying
I thought you were gay,

25:15.771 --> 25:17.570
'cause that is not
what I was saying.

25:17.572 --> 25:21.274
I would not want you
to think... That's not...

25:21.276 --> 25:22.675
Wow.

25:22.677 --> 25:24.677
So, yeah, Derek
is not my boyfriend,

25:24.679 --> 25:28.748
and I wouldn't even want Derek to be
my boyfriend even if he wasn't gay.

25:28.750 --> 25:34.053
I mean... You know what I'm saying?
Kevin?

25:38.225 --> 25:40.360
Sorry.

25:41.695 --> 25:45.331
Jesus Christ, Tanner.
It's dark as hell in here.

25:45.333 --> 25:45.865
Sorry.

25:45.867 --> 25:50.136
I need to borrow your... your car this weekend.
Is that all right?

25:51.806 --> 25:53.773
What have you got in your hand?

25:53.775 --> 25:57.310
Just pictures.
Photographs.

25:57.312 --> 25:59.145
Let's see.

25:59.147 --> 25:59.946
I don't think so.

25:59.948 --> 26:04.784
If you want to borrow the
Impala, show me the pictures.

26:13.928 --> 26:16.396
That's a good boy.

26:16.398 --> 26:19.799
Mmm.
Mmm.

26:20.801 --> 26:22.702
I saw this one on the poster.

26:22.704 --> 26:25.872
Wait a minute. You mean you
actually left your apartment?

26:25.874 --> 26:28.608
Hilarious.

26:31.445 --> 26:33.613
Did you fuck her?

26:36.116 --> 26:37.584
Let's look at yours.

26:37.586 --> 26:40.487
Mine are better.
Yeah, I'm sure.

26:42.624 --> 26:45.024
Hmm, hmm, hmm.

26:47.528 --> 26:50.630
Aw! God.

26:50.632 --> 26:53.333
Look at this one. What is...
What is that?

26:53.335 --> 26:55.602
That's a fish.

26:55.604 --> 26:57.136
Why would she...

26:57.138 --> 26:59.639
Look at this one.

27:00.307 --> 27:02.175
Yeah. Oh.

27:02.177 --> 27:04.010
Where do you get this shit?

27:04.012 --> 27:07.280
Come on, Kevin.
This is beautiful.

27:07.282 --> 27:09.616
You're so fucked up.

27:09.618 --> 27:11.417
Yeah.

27:12.553 --> 27:14.954
Can I keep this?

27:15.990 --> 27:18.725
Yeah, it's yours.

27:19.460 --> 27:21.094
Thanks.

27:21.096 --> 27:23.129
Don't you want this?

27:23.131 --> 27:25.365
No.
Why?

27:26.534 --> 27:28.568
What'd you do to her?

27:30.906 --> 27:33.239
I guess I scared her.

27:33.241 --> 27:35.241
Yeah, apparently.

27:35.243 --> 27:37.610
Apparently, I do that sometimes.

27:39.713 --> 27:43.583
Anyway, Adrienne's memory
played on in my psyche...

27:43.585 --> 27:47.687
like one of those
extended remixes...

27:47.689 --> 27:52.125
over and over and over.

27:52.127 --> 27:54.093
How did I forget her?

27:56.064 --> 27:58.197
<i>Hello?
Hey, it's Kevin.</i>

27:58.199 --> 28:02.702
<i>You, uh... You still
going camping?</i>

28:02.704 --> 28:03.303
Yes.

28:03.305 --> 28:06.039
So I'm pretty much not sure
what I'm going to call it yet.

28:06.041 --> 28:08.808
It could either be
a "uni-peg" or a "pega-corn,"

28:08.810 --> 28:12.612
or I could just call it something really
simple like "flying horse with horn."

28:12.614 --> 28:14.781
You know what I mean? If I
just need to keep it simple.

28:14.783 --> 28:18.818
But basically, it's like the most
incredible animal that's ever existed.

28:18.820 --> 28:20.687
It's half unicorn, half Pegasus.

28:20.689 --> 28:24.457
So it's like a flying horse
with wings and a horn.

28:24.459 --> 28:28.494
I can't even tell you how important the
Pegasus on its own, without a horn,

28:28.496 --> 28:30.296
has been essentially
since I was, like, born.

28:30.298 --> 28:32.565
'Cause when I was a kid, I had
this game called Dark Tower.

28:32.567 --> 28:35.101
It's, like, there's this tower,
and it's called the Dark Tower.

28:35.103 --> 28:38.371
And there's all these things like Brigands...
I think the Brigand is the bad guy.

28:38.373 --> 28:40.506
Then there's this other...
like you have rations.

28:40.508 --> 28:42.342
Oh, yeah. And you go
to the Bazaar.

28:42.344 --> 28:43.977
It spins around, and I don't know...
Jamie.

28:43.979 --> 28:49.515
Could you stop, like... Could you stop
talking, please? For like a second.

28:49.517 --> 28:51.584
- I'm sorry.-

28:51.586 --> 28:53.720
I'm really sorry.
No, don't be sorry.

28:53.722 --> 28:56.556
You just... You make me
nervous, I guess.

28:56.558 --> 28:58.725
There's nothing
to be nervous about.

28:58.727 --> 29:01.861
There isn't?
No. I like you, okay?

29:01.863 --> 29:05.498
Just... with the talking,
please just be calm, okay?

29:05.500 --> 29:07.834
For an exercise. Because
I want to be quiet.

29:07.836 --> 29:12.038
I mean, I really do. It's like
I want my mouth to just die.

29:12.040 --> 29:13.906
But then, like, all of
a sudden, it's back.

29:13.908 --> 29:16.909
It resurrects like Christ,
and then it's like... Jamie!

29:16.911 --> 29:18.277
Please!
I am begging you.

29:18.279 --> 29:20.380
Sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Thank you.

29:20.382 --> 29:22.148
I'll shut up.

29:29.056 --> 29:32.825
She told me how she feels
about you, Kevin.

29:32.960 --> 29:37.830
You might take that
into consideration.

29:39.767 --> 29:42.135
What are you talking about?

29:42.403 --> 29:46.673
Jamie's... very fragile.

29:48.442 --> 29:52.078
I'm not saying
she'd do anything, but...

29:53.681 --> 29:57.383
Just do me a favor
and be nice to her.

29:57.385 --> 29:58.785
Yeah.

29:58.787 --> 30:01.454
Yeah, of course.

30:24.612 --> 30:28.214
Everybody loves him.
He's very talented.

30:38.292 --> 30:42.628
Tweet, tweet, tweet, tweet.

30:44.832 --> 30:47.900
Tweet, tweet, tweet, tweet!

30:47.902 --> 30:51.938
I'm sorry.
Tweet, tweet.

30:54.174 --> 30:56.109
Tweet, tweet!

30:57.478 --> 31:01.547
In the end, I did end up
forgetting Theresa...

31:01.549 --> 31:06.285
and Doris and Allison
and Sheila and Adrienne...

31:06.287 --> 31:07.620
and... and all of them.

31:07.622 --> 31:09.889
I mean, it's not that
I forgot them literally though.

31:09.891 --> 31:15.394
It's just I made it
so I didn't care anymore.

31:15.629 --> 31:19.065
See? That's a picture
of me not caring.

31:20.935 --> 31:22.735
Ah, anyway, um,

31:22.737 --> 31:27.740
I decided I had to try to remember
more about my sister Nicole,

31:27.742 --> 31:28.908
what happened.

31:28.910 --> 31:31.644
Try to really find
the answer this time,

31:31.646 --> 31:37.850
try to figure out...
why I'm like this.

31:44.424 --> 31:47.827
All right, Ruby.
Are you comfortable?

31:50.230 --> 31:51.764
What do you want me to do?

31:51.766 --> 31:56.402
Well, I just... I want
to record you, okay?

31:57.571 --> 31:58.571
I want to...

31:58.573 --> 32:03.776
I want to record some of your
stories about the old days...

32:03.778 --> 32:05.444
because, uh...

32:05.446 --> 32:08.748
I mean, what happens
when you're gone, right?

32:08.750 --> 32:10.950
I mean, no one's gonna
know what you know.

32:10.952 --> 32:14.587
So, I just want you
to talk, all right?

32:14.589 --> 32:19.959
Just like normal. Forget
that the camera's even here.

32:20.928 --> 32:23.763
What do you want me
to talk about?

32:25.699 --> 32:27.667
Talk about Mom.

32:34.341 --> 32:36.776
Talk about Nicole.

32:45.820 --> 32:47.887
What is it?
Uh, there's someone here.

32:47.889 --> 32:52.625
I didn't have an appointment.
It's not a good time.

32:52.726 --> 32:55.628
I think you should
come out here, Kevin.

33:02.836 --> 33:06.205
- Hi.
- Um, my name is Denise Gilcrest,

33:06.207 --> 33:10.543
and this is my...
this is Mike Haley.

33:10.978 --> 33:13.512
What...
What can I do for you?

33:14.114 --> 33:16.349
Well...

33:16.650 --> 33:19.085
- Adrienne.
- She's my sister.

33:19.087 --> 33:22.054
- You're Kevin Wolfe, right?
- Yeah. Yeah.

33:22.056 --> 33:25.024
- I took these pictures.
- Have you seen her?

33:25.026 --> 33:30.329
Uh, no. I mean, not for a while.
You know.

33:30.331 --> 33:31.831
Why? Is... Is she...

33:31.833 --> 33:34.800
- She's been missing.
- Missing?

33:34.802 --> 33:38.337
- Did you know her?
- Me? No.

33:38.339 --> 33:41.407
No, I just saw her
when we did the pictures.

33:41.409 --> 33:45.044
But you knew her better than
that, didn't you, Kevin?

33:45.046 --> 33:49.415
Yeah. I mean, we went out one
night, um, and then that was it.

33:49.417 --> 33:52.985
I mean, I called her once after that, and
then we saw each other briefly, but...

33:52.987 --> 33:57.790
- Do you remember what day that was?
- Yeah, that was on...

33:58.158 --> 34:00.626
Uh, when was that?

34:00.628 --> 34:05.364
Uh, no, actually I don't
remember exactly.

34:05.366 --> 34:06.666
Well, where did you go?

34:06.668 --> 34:10.369
We went to a diner on 43rd
Street, and then, uh...

34:10.371 --> 34:12.271
Yeah, are you sure
she didn't just take off?

34:12.273 --> 34:14.572
Is that... I mean, you called
her friends and everything?

34:14.574 --> 34:18.411
If she just took off, she did it
with none of her belongings...

34:18.413 --> 34:20.012
no suitcase, no money, nothing.

34:20.014 --> 34:22.648
The detectives think
it's really unlikely, so...

34:22.650 --> 34:25.051
She would have called her
sister, don't you think?

34:25.053 --> 34:29.322
Are the police, like...
Are they helping you guys?

34:29.324 --> 34:29.989
Hardly.

34:29.991 --> 34:34.427
So, can you tell us what you talked
about the last time you saw her?

34:34.429 --> 34:39.465
Um, yeah. Well, I gave her these
pictures, and then, uh...

34:39.467 --> 34:42.234
and then, geez, what did we...
then we talked about, um...

34:42.235 --> 34:46.572
Well, we talked about why she
didn't really wanna see me.

34:46.574 --> 34:48.607
She was breaking up with you?

34:48.609 --> 34:53.646
Ye... Well, I mean, we had
hardly left it at that.

34:56.550 --> 34:59.685
Do you guys want coffee or...

35:01.188 --> 35:03.222
Hmm.

35:03.224 --> 35:04.323
Oh!

35:04.325 --> 35:07.026
You are one sick motherfucker.

35:07.028 --> 35:10.730
Ah, you're just as interested
in these pictures as I am.

35:10.732 --> 35:12.498
Mm-mmm.

35:12.500 --> 35:14.133
No, I like real girls.

35:14.135 --> 35:17.770
Yeah, but even these girls
won't do it...

35:17.772 --> 35:21.240
unless there's a camera there.

35:21.242 --> 35:21.974
It's true.

35:21.976 --> 35:27.046
The camera... That's what
makes all this magic happen.

35:27.048 --> 35:31.217
You do have a point. Which is exactly
why you became a photographer.

35:31.219 --> 35:35.421
So that you could get girls
to do twisted shit...

35:35.423 --> 35:38.524
like... that.

35:39.226 --> 35:42.261
I don't take pictures like this.

35:42.729 --> 35:45.197
What about that one?

35:45.966 --> 35:48.467
- It's not pornographic.
- She's naked.

35:48.469 --> 35:51.037
Yeah, but it's different.
It's completely different.

35:51.039 --> 35:54.740
Oh, yeah. I mean,
if I were you, I would...

35:54.841 --> 36:00.012
I'm not really interested in what their
bodies look like in these pictures.

36:01.081 --> 36:03.149
Would Adrienne do
something like...

36:03.151 --> 36:05.785
that?

36:06.953 --> 36:08.721
No.

36:10.057 --> 36:12.425
See her eyes?

36:12.626 --> 36:17.029
Yeah? Yeah, like, the
way they're flat.

36:17.031 --> 36:19.765
Looks like
she doesn't even care,

36:19.767 --> 36:21.867
like it doesn't even matter.
Yeah.

36:21.869 --> 36:23.436
That's exactly
what I don't like.

36:23.438 --> 36:25.938
When I have a girl
at the studio,

36:25.940 --> 36:27.840
she's, like...

36:27.842 --> 36:29.608
She's doing it for
a whole different reason.

36:29.610 --> 36:34.046
She's looking at the camera in a
completely different way, like...

36:34.048 --> 36:37.716
like she's looking out
at you from the inside.

36:38.251 --> 36:40.519
And you see it.

36:40.521 --> 36:43.622
You see that spark.

36:43.624 --> 36:46.125
You see that life.

36:50.931 --> 36:51.931
Good.

36:51.933 --> 36:54.366
Good. This is really good.
Have you modeled before?

36:54.368 --> 36:56.368
No. I'm an actress.

36:56.370 --> 36:58.537
I mean, I want to be an actress.

36:58.539 --> 37:01.540
Right. Wolfe Photography. Hello.

37:01.542 --> 37:04.543
Uh, Kevin's busy right now.
Who is it?

37:04.545 --> 37:07.079
Just some girl.
What girl?

37:07.081 --> 37:09.548
Uh, Beth, her name is.

37:09.550 --> 37:11.617
Beth.
Give me the phone.

37:11.619 --> 37:14.019
Hold on. Kevin wants
to talk to you.

37:14.021 --> 37:17.356
Hold on for one second.
Beth?

37:18.458 --> 37:20.659
Hi!
Beth from the play, right.

37:20.661 --> 37:24.730
Kevin won a, uh, portrait
award in college.

37:24.732 --> 37:28.901
I don't know if you know that.
It's true.

37:28.903 --> 37:30.736
I'm Jamie, by the way.

37:30.738 --> 37:31.770
I've been doing
Kevin's makeup...

37:31.772 --> 37:35.241
Well, not Kevin's makeup because Kevin
doesn't actually wear any makeup,

37:35.243 --> 37:36.976
but makeup for his clients,
you know.

37:36.978 --> 37:40.112
Girls like you...
actresses and models.

37:40.114 --> 37:42.414
You're not a model, are you?
Mm-mmm.

37:42.416 --> 37:43.482
No. Hmm.

37:43.484 --> 37:45.050
Good. I'm so glad
that you called.

37:45.052 --> 37:48.621
<i>Your pitch
was pretty hard to forget.</i>

37:48.623 --> 37:51.891
Remember Beth? Hmm?

37:52.359 --> 37:53.859
Those big, watery eyes.

37:53.861 --> 37:57.630
Her mouth permanently curved
into a half smile.

37:57.632 --> 38:02.468
I'll never forget the day that she looked
me dead in the eye and she said...

38:02.470 --> 38:04.470
Okay.

38:04.472 --> 38:06.138
You will?

38:06.140 --> 38:08.174
What do you wanna see?

38:08.176 --> 38:10.543
Um, I don't know.
Whatever.

38:10.545 --> 38:13.746
Anything that you wanna see.
You can pick it.

38:13.748 --> 38:16.615
Okay. I'll call you.

38:16.617 --> 38:21.520
Later this afternoon, I'll find
something and I'll call you.

38:22.155 --> 38:25.090
Good.
Okay, yeah, call me.

38:25.425 --> 38:28.127
Good.

38:28.129 --> 38:28.694
Okay.

38:28.696 --> 38:32.431
I was starting
to get giddy inside.

38:32.433 --> 38:35.601
Like all of a sudden,
I had another chance.

38:35.603 --> 38:39.071
It was like Adrienne had never happened.
Forget Adrienne!

38:39.073 --> 38:40.339
Just relax.

38:40.341 --> 38:44.476
I knew exactly what
was gonna happen next.

38:44.945 --> 38:46.779
It was gonna be awesome.

38:46.781 --> 38:51.784
Truly, incredibly,
amazingly fantastic.

38:51.786 --> 38:57.122
Easily the greatest romantic
experience of my entire...

38:57.124 --> 38:57.923
fucking... life.

38:57.925 --> 39:01.093
You're incredibly blotchy.
What are you talking about?

39:01.095 --> 39:05.297
Step away with that thing,
please. Please.

39:08.535 --> 39:12.671
Maybe afterwards
we could grab a bite to eat?

39:13.707 --> 39:15.608
Maybe.

39:17.644 --> 39:20.112
Maybe.

39:32.692 --> 39:35.995
- There's nothing wrong with me, is there?
- No.

39:35.997 --> 39:37.529
He could... He could...

39:37.531 --> 39:39.465
I mean, if I really
made an effort...

39:39.467 --> 39:41.734
You would totally
have to help me, Derek.

39:41.736 --> 39:45.137
Jamie. He could
go for me, right?

39:45.139 --> 39:48.340
Jamie. He's all I ever
think about, Derek.

39:48.342 --> 39:51.777
I know. He's all I
ever have on my mind.

39:51.779 --> 39:57.016
And sometimes I think if I could just get
him away from those girls for one minute,

39:57.018 --> 39:59.785
if I could just get them out
of the fucking picture...

39:59.787 --> 40:01.120
There's always another one.

40:01.122 --> 40:03.756
Maybe you should keep
your options open.

40:03.758 --> 40:05.724
There are a lot of boys
out there.

40:05.726 --> 40:08.894
Kevin can't be
the only one, can he?

40:08.896 --> 40:11.430
He kind of is.

40:16.169 --> 40:18.904
What was she like, Ruby?

40:18.906 --> 40:23.208
What was her...
her personality like?

40:25.412 --> 40:27.313
Oh.

40:27.315 --> 40:30.149
She was full of energy.

40:30.151 --> 40:32.718
She was rambunctious.

40:32.720 --> 40:34.787
Not like you.
You were always quiet,

40:34.789 --> 40:37.523
always such a quiet little boy.

40:38.892 --> 40:42.094
You were very sensitive,
you know.

40:42.796 --> 40:45.597
Oh, but I was so proud of you.

40:45.599 --> 40:47.066
So proud.

40:47.068 --> 40:49.535
Of both of you.

40:50.170 --> 40:52.905
You were such good children.

40:52.907 --> 40:55.407
A boy and a girl.

40:57.110 --> 41:00.179
Wish your mother
could have seen you.

41:00.181 --> 41:04.183
She never even saw your
sister at all, did she?

41:04.185 --> 41:07.086
She never even saw
what Nicole looked like.

41:07.088 --> 41:11.523
She never... She never got
to see her own daughter.

41:14.461 --> 41:18.964
How could I have lost
my two girls like that?

41:35.281 --> 41:38.150
Hey, hey.
Hey.

41:38.152 --> 41:40.352
Thought I wouldn't make it?

41:40.354 --> 41:42.187
Hmm. I wasn't sure.

41:42.189 --> 41:47.726
Uh, we don't have to see this
particular movie if you don't want to.

41:47.728 --> 41:49.294
I mean, there are
a lot we can go to.

41:49.296 --> 41:53.432
Yeah, this is fine. I really wanted
to see this, you know, so...

41:53.434 --> 41:56.602
And besides, I already
bought the tickets.

41:56.604 --> 41:57.736
Yeah.

41:57.738 --> 42:02.007
Um, do you want some popcorn?
Sure.

42:47.087 --> 42:50.622
La-la-la-la, la-la

42:50.624 --> 42:52.157
La-la

42:52.159 --> 42:55.394
La-la-la-la

43:02.635 --> 43:04.536
What about...

43:05.171 --> 43:10.509
What about the day
that she... you know...

43:11.811 --> 43:13.445
in the pool?

43:13.447 --> 43:17.683
Kevin. I can't.

43:18.718 --> 43:21.687
You can't remember?

43:24.023 --> 43:25.924
It was my fault.

43:25.926 --> 43:28.627
I wasn't there.
I wasn't...

43:29.762 --> 43:31.763
I know you tried.

43:33.166 --> 43:36.001
Did you see me?

43:36.003 --> 43:38.871
Did you see me try?

43:41.207 --> 43:45.811
You know what I like to do
sometimes, Derek?

43:45.813 --> 43:53.285
Sometimes I like to imagine that I have
this whole bottle of little blue pills.

43:53.287 --> 43:56.021
Why blue?

43:56.122 --> 44:00.459
I don't know.
I just like the color, I guess.

44:00.560 --> 44:03.962
And then, I take
these little blue pills...

44:03.964 --> 44:09.568
and I line them up
on the bed, one by one.

44:09.570 --> 44:10.969
Jamie, why are you
telling me this?

44:10.971 --> 44:15.140
<i>I'm just making
conversation, Derek.</i>

44:15.308 --> 44:19.978
Then I take the pills...

44:19.980 --> 44:23.815
and I push them into my mouth.

44:23.817 --> 44:25.751
Past my lips.

44:26.185 --> 44:30.689
But you don't have
any... of those pills.

44:30.691 --> 44:32.624
<i>Do you?</i>

44:32.626 --> 44:34.092
No.

44:34.094 --> 44:38.764
<i>No, of course not. 'Cause if
you did, you would tell me.</i>

44:38.766 --> 44:43.368
I tell you everything, Derek.
You're my sponsor.

44:43.370 --> 44:50.242
I just feel like,
why did she have to call him?

44:50.244 --> 44:52.110
<i>Who, Jamie?</i>

44:52.112 --> 44:56.615
Her name is...
B-E-T-H.

44:56.617 --> 45:00.419
Jamie, I'm... I'm gonna ask
you to do something for me.

45:00.421 --> 45:03.689
I'm gonna put down the phone.

45:03.691 --> 45:06.658
And I want you
to look at yourself.

45:06.660 --> 45:10.329
This is gonna sound stupid, but I want
you to look at yourself in the mirror,

45:10.331 --> 45:15.133
and I want you to tell
yourself that you're pretty.

45:18.538 --> 45:23.041
- Did you hear me?
- Are you serious?

45:23.509 --> 45:25.110
<i>Do that for me, Jamie.</i>

45:25.112 --> 45:28.447
Are... Are you gonna stay
on the phone?

45:28.449 --> 45:30.649
<i>I'm right here.</i>

45:30.651 --> 45:33.452
Okay.

45:42.629 --> 45:45.797
You... are...

45:46.232 --> 45:51.503
You... are...

45:51.505 --> 45:56.341
Fuck you.

45:56.343 --> 45:57.843
Go fuck yourself!

45:57.845 --> 45:59.578
I'm not even fucking
kidding around right now.

45:59.580 --> 46:03.815
Go fuck yourself,
you stupid piece of shit!

46:03.817 --> 46:05.183
I fucking hate you!

46:05.185 --> 46:10.756
I fucking hate you,
and I want you to fucking die!

46:18.798 --> 46:24.536
The holy crosses

46:25.071 --> 46:28.807
Shit.

46:29.509 --> 46:31.643
Co... Coming.

46:38.785 --> 46:40.619
Did you find her?

46:40.621 --> 46:42.754
No.

46:42.855 --> 46:45.590
Did you ask anyone in the diner?

46:45.592 --> 46:49.461
Nobody remembers
you two being there.

46:50.530 --> 46:53.198
Where's your boyfriend?
Kevin.

46:54.100 --> 46:57.069
Do you mind if I
ask you a question?

46:57.071 --> 46:59.638
No, not at all.

47:01.007 --> 47:03.075
Did you do something to her?

47:03.077 --> 47:05.277
Listen, I-I...

47:05.279 --> 47:10.248
I am really sorry if something bad has
happened to your sister. I really am.

47:10.250 --> 47:14.920
<i>But it was her decision to not
see me anymore, you know?</i>

47:14.922 --> 47:17.456
That was her choice, not mine.

47:17.458 --> 47:21.059
I've just been trying
to forget I ever met her.

47:22.895 --> 47:24.029
I'm sorry.
No, I'm sorry.

47:24.031 --> 47:27.966
I don't know what I'm doing. Just tell me...
Tell me how to help.

47:27.968 --> 47:30.602
I just don't know where she is.

47:30.604 --> 47:33.772
I know. Gee.

47:33.774 --> 47:38.477
I'm so sorry.
No, no, no, no. It's okay.

47:38.479 --> 47:41.213
It's okay.

48:10.643 --> 48:13.011
That was good.
The movie?

48:13.013 --> 48:14.546
Oh, no, the...
the pizza.

48:14.548 --> 48:19.951
Was it, uh, Ray's
Original or Famous Ray's?

48:19.953 --> 48:23.989
Famous Ray's Original.

48:29.128 --> 48:33.632
Um, you can kiss me now.

48:38.004 --> 48:39.504
Really?

49:18.344 --> 49:19.477
Hey, hey.

49:19.479 --> 49:23.515
Sorry. Not, uh... Not yet. What?

49:27.019 --> 49:29.621
Um...

49:42.735 --> 49:48.607
Kevin. Kevin. Kevin,
come on. I said stop.

49:48.609 --> 49:51.209
Shit.
Okay.

49:51.211 --> 49:53.311
Sorry.

49:55.514 --> 49:57.916
I just, uh...

49:59.552 --> 50:03.755
Sorry.
I thought that we had a...

50:04.590 --> 50:05.590
Oh.
Sorry.

50:05.592 --> 50:10.161
No. You're really nice,
you know. Uh...

50:10.163 --> 50:14.833
Nice.
And I really like you.

50:14.835 --> 50:17.068
And... I just...

50:17.070 --> 50:22.507
I just barely know you.
You know? I mean, we just, um...

50:22.509 --> 50:24.142
I just met you.
And I...

50:24.144 --> 50:29.881
I just think, you know,
I gotta wait a little.

50:29.883 --> 50:33.385
I mean, you've just
gotta be patient.

50:36.289 --> 50:38.757
But I love you.

50:41.594 --> 50:45.297
Suddenly, I could see
directly into the future.

50:45.299 --> 50:46.932
Sorry.

50:47.033 --> 50:52.470
I could see the days unfolding in front
of me like pages of a newspaper.

50:52.472 --> 50:54.739
Huh.
What do you mean?

50:54.741 --> 50:59.477
And I realized that Beth
was far, far away.

50:59.479 --> 51:03.848
I would have to forget Beth
with some... severity.

51:03.850 --> 51:05.984
It wouldn't be easy.

51:06.085 --> 51:13.124
Forgetting Beth
would not be easy at all.

51:13.359 --> 51:17.495
If I told her the truth... This is bullshit.
I'm sorry. This...

51:17.497 --> 51:21.333
If I told her who I really was...

51:21.867 --> 51:23.101
I probably should go.

51:23.103 --> 51:25.737
She would hate me.

51:27.807 --> 51:28.807
Uh, Kev. Uh...

51:28.809 --> 51:33.578
Why would she go out with me in the first place?
What the fuck is wrong with her?

51:35.414 --> 51:36.414
Kevin...

51:36.416 --> 51:40.118
<i>What the fuck is wrong with me?</i>

51:41.487 --> 51:43.321
I just...

51:43.889 --> 51:48.660
And I guess I hadn't really
forgotten Adrienne after all.

52:05.378 --> 52:09.514
Sometimes nothing can help you forget
a girl better than another one.

52:09.516 --> 52:13.451
Hello?

52:13.453 --> 52:16.254
Hey, it's me.
What are you doing?

52:16.256 --> 52:20.158
<i>What happened to your date?
What date?</i>

52:20.160 --> 52:21.426
Oh.

52:21.428 --> 52:24.162
Uh, are you hungry?

52:24.164 --> 52:25.897
No.

52:25.899 --> 52:30.735
- Will you meet me?
- Okay.

52:30.737 --> 52:35.840
The truth is, women are objects.

52:35.842 --> 52:39.144
I mean, the feminists
can say what they want,

52:39.146 --> 52:41.746
but when it comes
right down to it,

52:41.748 --> 52:44.616
girls are made of bones...

52:44.618 --> 52:48.319
and muscle...
and blood.

52:48.321 --> 52:49.954
And you're over there.

52:49.956 --> 52:55.827
You're right behind the camera,
looking at them,

52:55.829 --> 53:00.331
creating a moment,
an object in space.

53:00.333 --> 53:01.666
- And you're saying...
- Smile.

53:01.668 --> 53:05.370
Look this way. And smooth your hair
just back a little off your eye.

53:05.372 --> 53:09.441
<i>- And they're saying...
- How do you want me?</i>

53:09.875 --> 53:12.844
Here?
Like this?

53:12.846 --> 53:16.848
And you're saying... yes.

53:16.850 --> 53:20.685
Yes, I want you exactly...

53:20.687 --> 53:22.787
like...

53:23.823 --> 53:25.323
that.

53:29.662 --> 53:31.529
Like that.

54:39.265 --> 54:40.765
I take the "A" train

54:40.767 --> 54:41.267
No!

54:46.505 --> 54:47.505
Oh, yes!

54:47.507 --> 54:51.409
That's one of the saddest
things I've ever seen.

54:51.411 --> 54:54.012
I'm fine.
And...

54:54.014 --> 54:56.814
- Oh!
- Yes! I got one.

54:56.816 --> 54:57.649
Notice the form.

54:57.651 --> 54:59.851
You're like...
I'm a champion!

54:59.853 --> 55:02.787
Go, Kevin, go!

55:03.489 --> 55:06.257
Your aim... It almost looks like
you're placing it in the gutter.

55:06.259 --> 55:09.093
There.
You want a direct line.

55:09.095 --> 55:13.131
Cool it, cool it, cool it, cool
it, cool it, cool it, cool it

55:13.133 --> 55:16.301
Feel the hot dough

55:16.303 --> 55:17.602
Are you kidding me?
Oh!

55:17.604 --> 55:19.904
Are you kidding me?
Oh!

55:19.906 --> 55:21.940
Oh, my God.
I'm like a bowling genius.

55:21.942 --> 55:23.975
- That is... Wow.
- Oh, my God.

55:23.977 --> 55:24.977
That... Wow.

55:24.978 --> 55:28.913
Is this helping you?

55:28.915 --> 55:31.216
What do you mean?

55:31.218 --> 55:34.052
With that girl.
With Beth.

55:34.054 --> 55:38.690
Is this helping you with
your forgetting thing?

55:45.497 --> 55:49.200
Do you know what I need?
What?

55:50.369 --> 55:52.403
I need whiskey.

55:53.172 --> 55:54.973
Neat.

55:55.874 --> 55:59.110
Do you want to go get a drink?

55:59.112 --> 56:01.279
Yeah.

56:01.447 --> 56:03.381
That would be fantastic.

56:03.383 --> 56:05.383
Okay.

56:36.883 --> 56:38.950
Looks like you caught me.

56:38.952 --> 56:43.454
Mmm. Looks like I did.

57:00.707 --> 57:03.074
My parents are dead.

57:04.310 --> 57:08.579
Or actually, you know, that I...
I never actually met my dad,

57:08.581 --> 57:10.815
so... who knows?

57:10.817 --> 57:13.985
Who knows?
He might still be alive.

57:13.987 --> 57:20.058
Um... And then when I was eight or...
seven.

57:20.060 --> 57:22.827
Uh... Something like that...
Eight, seven.

57:22.829 --> 57:28.933
I... had a sister.
Uh, Nicole.

57:28.935 --> 57:34.038
I have a dead sister...
named Nicole.

57:34.273 --> 57:36.841
What-What happened to her?

57:36.843 --> 57:39.143
You know, I don't know.

57:39.145 --> 57:42.680
I, uh... It's hard
for me to remember.

57:42.682 --> 57:44.849
I, uh...

57:44.851 --> 57:47.452
She drowned in the pool.

57:47.454 --> 57:49.587
She drowned?
Yeah.

57:49.589 --> 57:52.290
Oh, my God.

57:55.294 --> 57:57.795
It's okay, Kevin.

57:57.797 --> 58:00.932
Is it?
Yeah.

58:00.934 --> 58:03.668
It's fine.

58:04.803 --> 58:06.938
I don't pay you enough.
Oh, my God.

58:06.940 --> 58:08.306
Jamie, I don't.
Come on.

58:08.308 --> 58:11.275
I don't. I mean, here we
are, we're sitting here.

58:11.277 --> 58:14.112
I feel like I can
tell you anything.

58:14.114 --> 58:16.681
You can.
Yeah.

58:16.683 --> 58:18.449
I feel like I can...

58:18.451 --> 58:23.187
I-I can explain myself to you.
You can.

58:23.189 --> 58:25.757
I feel like...

58:25.759 --> 58:27.725
I feel like you understand.

58:27.727 --> 58:29.827
I do, Kevin.
Yeah.

58:29.829 --> 58:33.765
I do.
I-I do understand.

58:33.767 --> 58:37.168
I understand
absolutely everything.

58:37.170 --> 58:41.472
Anything that you could ever
say to me, I would understand.

58:41.474 --> 58:45.410
And there's something that I've
been wanting to tell you too.

58:45.412 --> 58:47.678
For a really long time, okay?
Mm-hmm.

58:47.680 --> 58:52.083
And that is that...
I told my mom...

58:52.085 --> 58:55.920
that you were my boyfriend.

58:55.922 --> 58:58.489
And, like, I know
that I shouldn't have.

58:58.491 --> 59:01.058
Oh, and another thing:
I've been following you.

59:01.060 --> 59:04.061
When you're with those girls.
Just to make sure you're okay.

59:04.063 --> 59:06.764
And I know that I shouldn't
and everything, but I just...

59:06.766 --> 59:08.399
I don't know. I wanted
to make sure you were okay.

59:08.401 --> 59:12.170
And I just felt, like, a little bit
jealous, and, uh... I don't know.

59:12.172 --> 59:18.075
It's just that I've always felt like we
have this amazing connection, you know?

59:18.077 --> 59:19.777
And, like, the first time
I ever met you...

59:19.779 --> 59:22.880
It was like
I was watching again.

59:22.882 --> 59:27.018
I mean, I was there
with Jamie, in the bar,

59:27.020 --> 59:28.986
sitting on the hard stool.

59:28.988 --> 59:34.759
But my true self
was actually up in the ceiling,

59:34.860 --> 59:39.597
looking down,
watching myself sitting there.

59:40.132 --> 59:42.700
I could see Jamie too.

59:54.780 --> 59:59.317
I left you on the bed

59:59.319 --> 01:00:03.721
And took all the money

01:00:10.063 --> 01:00:16.901
Gonna buy you something
to ease the hurt

01:00:16.903 --> 01:00:20.838
You're here.

01:00:21.807 --> 01:00:24.141
You're here.
I am.

01:00:24.576 --> 01:00:27.445
I've loved you for so long.

01:00:30.048 --> 01:00:31.048
I know.

01:00:31.050 --> 01:00:36.287
I've always loved you.

01:00:36.289 --> 01:00:38.623
I know.

01:00:38.625 --> 01:00:40.992
It's okay.

01:00:41.159 --> 01:00:44.228
Okay.

01:00:46.131 --> 01:00:49.033
This is Jean. Jean.

01:00:49.035 --> 01:00:53.170
Forgotten after
a full-release body massage.

01:00:55.274 --> 01:00:56.807
Oh, this is Fiona.

01:00:56.809 --> 01:01:02.380
Uh... I forgot Fiona by joining
a gym I never ended up going to.

01:01:02.781 --> 01:01:08.619
Brenda. I forgot Brenda
at the Museum of Modern Art.

01:01:09.087 --> 01:01:12.456
I forgot... Mary.

01:01:12.458 --> 01:01:14.191
Forgot Sarah.

01:01:14.193 --> 01:01:16.894
Forgot Kelly.

01:01:16.896 --> 01:01:18.763
I forgot...

01:01:19.932 --> 01:01:22.266
Forgot.

01:01:22.268 --> 01:01:24.402
Forgot.

01:01:24.404 --> 01:01:26.604
Forgot.

01:01:56.935 --> 01:01:59.303
Holy shit.

01:02:13.852 --> 01:02:16.020
I had to do something radical,

01:02:16.022 --> 01:02:19.624
something to forget all this
in a major way.

01:02:19.626 --> 01:02:21.726
I was really going
out of my mind, I admit.

01:02:21.728 --> 01:02:24.795
And I don't think I knew...
I mean, I...

01:02:24.797 --> 01:02:27.632
I knew what was going on,
what was happening.

01:02:27.634 --> 01:02:31.702
But I had to find some way
of canceling it all out.

01:02:31.704 --> 01:02:35.773
Of forgetting Beth,
forgetting Adrienne...

01:02:35.775 --> 01:02:40.077
and especially forgetting Jamie.

01:02:46.985 --> 01:02:50.087
I had to forget Jamie.

01:03:23.689 --> 01:03:27.525
Kevie. Kevie!

01:03:28.093 --> 01:03:29.493
Kevin!

01:03:29.495 --> 01:03:32.663
I really feel that we
made this... this connection.

01:03:32.665 --> 01:03:35.232
I'm really sorry, Kevin.
But I love you.

01:03:35.234 --> 01:03:36.934
What do you mean?

01:03:36.936 --> 01:03:39.003
I feel like
I can tell you anything.

01:03:39.005 --> 01:03:43.274
I've been following
you. I've always loved you.

01:03:53.251 --> 01:03:55.019
Beth.

01:03:55.021 --> 01:03:57.521
What are you doing here?
Oh.

01:03:57.523 --> 01:04:01.225
I thought you were someone else.
Ow.

01:04:03.361 --> 01:04:06.063
Poor Beth.

01:04:06.065 --> 01:04:09.867
She couldn't have known
what I was doing this for.

01:04:09.869 --> 01:04:12.903
But once I started,

01:04:14.506 --> 01:04:16.807
I had to keep going.

01:04:28.520 --> 01:04:30.254
Come on.

01:04:30.256 --> 01:04:33.390
I had to forget about
all this somehow.

01:04:34.893 --> 01:04:36.761
Kevie. Kevie!

01:04:36.763 --> 01:04:40.331
<i>I just wish I could remember more
about Nicole, you know? Kevie!</i>

01:04:40.333 --> 01:04:43.768
What the hell was she doing in that pool anyway?
She wasn't allowed.

01:04:43.770 --> 01:04:48.139
She was too little to swim. I
mean, I could barely swim myself.

01:04:51.543 --> 01:04:54.612
What was I supposed to do?

01:04:54.813 --> 01:04:57.681
How was I supposed to save her?

01:05:21.039 --> 01:05:23.808
What are we gonna do with her?

01:05:27.245 --> 01:05:29.313
How did you get in?

01:05:31.016 --> 01:05:34.051
I finally got a key made.

01:05:36.788 --> 01:05:38.722
Oh.

01:05:41.626 --> 01:05:46.363
Why don't you go hop in the
shower, and I'll clean up here.

01:05:52.003 --> 01:05:53.270
Go.

01:06:14.025 --> 01:06:19.697
In the past I was a man

01:06:20.700 --> 01:06:26.937
But now I'm a ghost
with dirty hands

01:06:28.074 --> 01:06:32.376
I stain the ground
as I crawl to you

01:06:35.580 --> 01:06:39.216
I stain the ground
as I move on through

01:06:39.218 --> 01:06:41.585
Good.

01:06:41.587 --> 01:06:45.656
Good. And tilt... Tilt your head a
little to the left. A little more.

01:06:45.658 --> 01:06:46.824
Yeah. Completely.

01:06:46.826 --> 01:06:49.793
In the dark I cannot sleep

01:06:49.795 --> 01:06:53.397
Good. That's good.

01:06:53.732 --> 01:06:59.403
<i>- I can't escape these thoughts that creep
- Hmm.</i>

01:07:03.408 --> 01:07:05.309
Good. Look this way.

01:07:05.311 --> 01:07:07.578
Great.
Yeah, let's see that smile.

01:07:07.580 --> 01:07:10.314
Good. Good.

01:07:10.316 --> 01:07:12.016
Perfect.

01:07:12.951 --> 01:07:15.686
Move your hair.

01:07:19.457 --> 01:07:24.895
A shadow descending to be a man

01:07:30.201 --> 01:07:32.970
Why don't you sit up here?

01:07:32.972 --> 01:07:34.038
Me?

01:07:34.040 --> 01:07:36.840
- Just for one shot.-

01:07:36.842 --> 01:07:38.742
Mmm.
My makeup is a mess.

01:07:38.744 --> 01:07:40.978
No, that's okay. It's not
a glamour shot, Jamie.

01:07:40.980 --> 01:07:45.783
Plus, I just... I don't have any
pictures of you, that's all.

01:07:53.825 --> 01:07:55.993
Let's see.

01:08:08.807 --> 01:08:15.212
- You know, Jamie, I've been thinking about...
- I'm not gonna tell anyone.

01:08:15.214 --> 01:08:17.046
I know.

01:08:17.349 --> 01:08:20.551
I know that you
wouldn't do that. But...

01:08:21.618 --> 01:08:24.087
You have to understand, I...

01:08:24.090 --> 01:08:28.559
I can't go around
remembering all of this.

01:08:29.327 --> 01:08:33.697
You know?
I have to forget.

01:08:34.765 --> 01:08:37.935
Well-Well,
what about last night?

01:08:37.937 --> 01:08:40.504
Do you have to forget...

01:08:51.850 --> 01:08:55.252
Jamie,

01:08:55.254 --> 01:08:57.755
last night was...

01:08:59.624 --> 01:09:01.225
a mistake.

01:09:01.227 --> 01:09:01.727
Oh.

01:09:05.631 --> 01:09:08.232
Do you know what I mean?

01:09:17.443 --> 01:09:21.045
It's okay.

01:09:21.046 --> 01:09:23.247
It's okay.

01:09:24.149 --> 01:09:26.483
It's okay.

01:09:27.018 --> 01:09:31.354
'Cause I... I have been
thinking about something...

01:09:31.357 --> 01:09:34.792
for a really long time.

01:09:34.794 --> 01:09:37.728
And I even told Derek about it.

01:09:37.729 --> 01:09:41.064
And he's trying
to talk me out of it, but...

01:09:41.067 --> 01:09:47.037
I've got a whole...
whole fucking bottle.

01:09:47.038 --> 01:09:50.240
Of what?

01:09:50.242 --> 01:09:52.709
Blue pills.

01:09:53.243 --> 01:09:55.846
Blue.

01:09:56.548 --> 01:09:58.415
Blue.

01:09:59.417 --> 01:10:03.921
Jamie, it's gonna be beautiful.

01:10:04.856 --> 01:10:06.723
It's gonna be so beautiful.

01:10:06.725 --> 01:10:08.859
You.
Beautiful?

01:10:08.861 --> 01:10:09.960
You...

01:10:09.962 --> 01:10:13.697
are gonna be so beautiful.

01:10:13.699 --> 01:10:16.500
Beautiful.
So beautiful.

01:10:18.070 --> 01:10:21.472
So beautiful.
I promise.

01:10:22.907 --> 01:10:24.308
I promise.

01:10:24.310 --> 01:10:28.545
I'll give you something.

01:10:30.982 --> 01:10:35.185
I wanna be beautiful
for you, Kevin.

01:10:35.453 --> 01:10:39.289
I wanna be beautiful for you.

01:10:46.231 --> 01:10:50.968
Kevin, if you are watching this,

01:10:50.970 --> 01:10:54.505
that means that you found me.

01:10:54.672 --> 01:10:58.041
And I just want you to know...

01:10:58.043 --> 01:11:02.679
<i>why I killed Beth Dalewell
in your studio.</i>

01:11:02.681 --> 01:11:04.982
<i>And also,</i>

01:11:04.984 --> 01:11:10.454
<i>why I took Adrienne
Gilcrest's life too.</i>

01:11:12.123 --> 01:11:14.758
<i>I guess I was jealous.</i>

01:11:15.260 --> 01:11:20.230
And now I have nothing left...

01:11:20.232 --> 01:11:22.166
<i>to live for.</i>

01:11:22.168 --> 01:11:25.669
<i>I have nothing left.</i>

01:11:26.104 --> 01:11:28.038
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

01:11:30.475 --> 01:11:33.277
This is Adrienne.

01:11:33.279 --> 01:11:36.446
I forgot her on a camping trip.

01:11:39.884 --> 01:11:42.386
This is Beth.

01:11:42.388 --> 01:11:44.254
Forgotten.

01:11:45.456 --> 01:11:48.926
And this is Jamie.

01:12:03.375 --> 01:12:07.244
Where did you get these anyway?

01:12:07.246 --> 01:12:09.680
A doctor.

01:12:09.682 --> 01:12:11.481
Said I was nervous.

01:12:11.483 --> 01:12:17.187
You should wipe your fingerprints
off the bottle, don't you think?

01:12:17.189 --> 01:12:19.156
Don't worry.

01:12:21.526 --> 01:12:25.229
What if it doesn't work?

01:12:25.730 --> 01:12:28.632
It'll work.

01:12:46.351 --> 01:12:48.652
Kevin.

01:12:49.554 --> 01:12:51.955
Can I keep my clothes on?

01:12:51.957 --> 01:12:56.426
Sure. Sure,
you can keep 'em on.

01:16:18.664 --> 01:16:23.900
If you're watching this, you've
discovered something you shouldn't have.

01:16:31.643 --> 01:16:33.610
Anyway, um...

01:16:34.011 --> 01:16:38.482
This... This is a close-up
of a model's eye.

01:16:38.484 --> 01:16:43.954
I can't remember her name to save my life,
but she had the bluest eyes I'd ever seen.

01:16:43.956 --> 01:16:49.359
The only other time I remember seeing
this exact intensity of blue...

01:16:49.361 --> 01:16:52.462
was the day my sister drowned.

01:16:52.864 --> 01:16:55.098
It was everywhere...

01:16:55.333 --> 01:17:00.770
in the water, in the sky,
Nicole's skin.

01:17:00.772 --> 01:17:01.838
Blue.

01:17:06.078 --> 01:17:10.447
Nicole. She's the one girl
I keep trying to remember.

01:17:10.449 --> 01:17:13.917
But I... I think
she's the problem.

01:17:13.919 --> 01:17:17.821
I think...
I think she's the reason...

01:17:17.823 --> 01:17:21.658
I am the way I am, right?

01:17:31.135 --> 01:17:34.371
This is what it looked like,
these flashes of white.

01:17:34.373 --> 01:17:37.340
It was like this empty slide.

01:17:37.708 --> 01:17:41.978
The sun was flashing
off the water.

01:17:42.146 --> 01:17:44.548
It was just like this.

01:17:49.620 --> 01:17:52.088
Jesus.

01:17:56.060 --> 01:17:58.495
I watched her.

01:18:01.399 --> 01:18:04.034
I watched the whole thing.

01:18:06.370 --> 01:18:10.040
Through the blue and the gold
and the white flashes.

01:18:12.176 --> 01:18:14.444
The white...

01:18:14.446 --> 01:18:16.146
flashes.

01:18:16.148 --> 01:18:17.614
Flashes.

01:18:22.320 --> 01:18:25.522
Kevie!

01:18:25.856 --> 01:18:28.658
Kevin!

01:18:33.966 --> 01:18:34.466
Kevin!

01:18:39.236 --> 01:18:42.973
Help me! Somebody help!

01:18:42.975 --> 01:18:46.109
Do you remember
what happened, sweetheart?

01:18:46.111 --> 01:18:48.678
I just don't remember.

01:18:54.819 --> 01:18:57.220
I watched her.

01:18:58.689 --> 01:19:02.258
I was looking through the light.

01:19:03.060 --> 01:19:05.562
Into the heart of the light.

01:19:05.963 --> 01:19:08.231
Into the silence.

01:19:11.135 --> 01:19:14.971
I knew my baby sister
was drowning.

01:19:16.374 --> 01:19:18.742
And I let it happen.

01:19:24.115 --> 01:19:26.316
I watched it...

01:19:27.685 --> 01:19:30.086
because it was beautiful.

01:19:33.491 --> 01:19:35.058
I let it happen...

01:19:35.060 --> 01:19:39.529
because it was beautiful to see.

01:19:58.783 --> 01:20:03.086
Under the water,
Nicole called my name.

01:20:03.954 --> 01:20:06.790
What I saw
were flashes of light.

01:20:07.892 --> 01:20:10.060
And what I heard...

01:20:10.661 --> 01:20:13.496
What did I hear?

01:20:13.631 --> 01:20:17.967
Put your hands over your ears.

01:20:19.503 --> 01:20:21.738
Press down.

01:21:21.365 --> 01:21:27.303
I know it's hard to tell
how mixed up you feel

01:21:27.305 --> 01:21:32.475
Hoping what you need
is behind every door

01:21:32.477 --> 01:21:37.580
Each time you get hurt,
I don't want you to change

01:21:37.582 --> 01:21:42.719
'Cause everyone has hopes
You're human after all

01:21:42.721 --> 01:21:48.558
The feeling sometimes, wishing
you were someone else

01:21:48.560 --> 01:21:53.496
Feeling as though
you never belong

01:21:53.498 --> 01:21:58.935
This feeling is not sadness
This feeling is not joy

01:21:58.937 --> 01:22:05.775
I truly understand
Please don't cry now

01:22:07.311 --> 01:22:12.182
Please don't go
I want you to stay

01:22:12.184 --> 01:22:17.187
I'm begging you, please
Please don't leave here

01:22:17.189 --> 01:22:22.725
I don't want you to hate for
all the hurt that you feel

01:22:22.727 --> 01:22:29.432
The world is just illusion
trying to change you

01:22:31.168 --> 01:22:36.439
Being like you are
Well, this is something else

01:22:36.441 --> 01:22:42.178
Who would comprehend?
But some that do lay claim

01:22:42.180 --> 01:22:46.983
Divine purpose blesses them

01:22:46.985 --> 01:22:49.886
Well, that's not what I believe

01:22:49.888 --> 01:22:52.889
And it doesn't matter anyway

01:22:52.891 --> 01:22:57.727
A part of your soul
ties you to the next world

01:22:57.729 --> 01:23:02.732
Or maybe to the last,
but I'm still not sure

01:23:02.734 --> 01:23:08.204
But what I do know is
to us the world is different

01:23:08.206 --> 01:23:14.611
As we are to the world
I guess you would know that

01:23:16.647 --> 01:23:21.384
Please don't go
I want you to stay

01:23:21.386 --> 01:23:26.489
I'm begging you, please
Please don't leave here

01:23:26.491 --> 01:23:32.061
I don't want you to hate for
all the hurt that you feel

01:23:32.063 --> 01:23:37.800
The world is just illusion
trying to change you

01:23:37.802 --> 01:23:42.639
Please don't go
I want you to stay

01:23:42.641 --> 01:23:47.844
I'm begging you, please
Oh, please don't leave here

01:23:47.846 --> 01:23:53.283
I don't want you to change for
all the hurt that you feel

01:23:53.285 --> 01:23:59.989
This world is just illusion
always trying to change you

01:24:31.288 --> 01:24:36.125
Please don't go
I want you to stay

01:24:36.127 --> 01:24:41.164
I'm begging you, please
Please don't leave here

01:24:41.166 --> 01:24:46.636
I don't want you to hate for
all the hurt that you feel

01:24:46.638 --> 01:24:52.508
The world is just illusion
trying to change you

01:24:52.510 --> 01:24:57.313
Please don't go
I want you to stay

01:24:57.315 --> 01:25:02.552
I'm begging you, please
Oh, please don't leave here

01:25:02.554 --> 01:25:07.890
I don't want you to change for
all the hurt that you feel

01:25:07.892 --> 01:25:14.931
This world is just illusion
always trying to change you
