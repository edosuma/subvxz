Scott:
I'm turning the attic
into my office.

00:08.486 --> 00:09.574
I'm going to
run for mayor.

00:09.661 --> 00:11.228
Wow, Mom, that's huge.

00:11.315 --> 00:14.797
Tomorrow,
auditions will be held
for Murder Masquerade.

00:14.884 --> 00:17.321
I was walking in the garden
when I murdered Lord Cumberland,

00:17.408 --> 00:20.411
and-- Wait.
Murdered, that--
that's not right.

00:20.498 --> 00:22.892
This is a mistake.
I never should have
auditioned.

00:22.979 --> 00:24.981
If I can't be an actor,
I'd still like to be
a part of it.

00:25.068 --> 00:26.635
Maybe you can
help build sets.

00:26.722 --> 00:28.637
- Oh...
- The book.
It's gone.

00:28.724 --> 00:31.292
- And the spices.
- Do you think
someone stole it?

00:31.379 --> 00:33.468
- This is bad.
- I know that guy.

00:33.555 --> 00:35.426
RJ White bought
the winning ticket

00:35.513 --> 00:37.080
in the Saffron Falls
lottery.

00:37.167 --> 00:38.864
That's the kook
I met at Mama P's

00:38.951 --> 00:41.476
who tried to convince me
that Grandma was under
a magic spell.

00:41.563 --> 00:42.999
I bet he cheated.

00:43.086 --> 00:44.957
I guarantee you
he cheated.

Well,
I was going to,

02:34.806 --> 02:37.809
but let's just say
he doesn't have
a warm personality.

02:37.896 --> 02:38.854
[knocking]

02:41.378 --> 02:43.206
What did you find out
about RJ?

02:43.293 --> 02:45.469
Whoa. How about a
"Hi, Jake, nice to see you."

02:45.556 --> 02:46.992
All: Hi, Jake,
nice to see you.

02:47.079 --> 02:49.517
Thank you for
doing this for us.

02:49.604 --> 02:51.693
Yeah, we would have
investigated him ourselves,

02:51.780 --> 02:52.694
but he knows
what we look like.

02:52.781 --> 02:54.043
You were right.

02:54.130 --> 02:55.523
Being a sleuth
is kind of awesome.

02:55.610 --> 02:57.133
I know.
It's so fun.

02:57.220 --> 02:58.874
Especially when
disguises are involved.

02:58.961 --> 03:01.746
- Does he have the book?
- He does.

03:01.833 --> 03:03.792
That's why he's
always carrying around
that old backpack.

03:03.879 --> 03:06.011
Ugh.
That is not a good look
for a grown man.

03:06.098 --> 03:07.622
First he went
clothes shopping.

03:07.709 --> 03:09.493
Dude has terrible taste.

03:09.580 --> 03:12.104
He bought six pairs
of cargo shorts.

03:12.192 --> 03:14.411
And then he went
shoe shopping.

03:14.498 --> 03:16.544
- With the book?
- Oh, yeah.

03:16.631 --> 03:18.502
And he bought three pairs
of tennis shoes.

03:18.589 --> 03:20.287
He was also rude to
the sales assistant

03:20.374 --> 03:22.376
because they didn't have
the right kind of shoelaces.

03:22.463 --> 03:24.769
And then,
before I came over,

03:24.856 --> 03:26.293
he went
grocery shopping.

03:26.380 --> 03:27.511
Wait. He went to
the grocery store?

03:27.598 --> 03:29.252
You could have
started with that.

03:29.339 --> 03:30.688
- Did you see what he bought?
- Is he cooking a spell?

03:30.775 --> 03:31.950
What was wrong with
the shoelaces?

03:32.037 --> 03:34.649
Whoa. Okay, uh...

03:34.736 --> 03:37.391
he bought eggs,
but not the cage-free kind,

03:37.478 --> 03:40.394
which I thought
was a bad choice,
but who am I to judge.

03:40.481 --> 03:43.527
He also bought a bow,
and a small box.

03:43.614 --> 03:46.269
You know,
the kind you would
put a cupcake in.

03:46.356 --> 03:49.968
What happened next was
really disturbing.

03:50.055 --> 03:51.187
He bought
generic cake mix.

03:51.274 --> 03:52.884
- No.
- Eww.

03:52.971 --> 03:55.017
That was my reaction, too.

03:55.104 --> 03:56.453
So I decided to
talk to him.

03:56.540 --> 03:58.847
You made contact?
Jake, I told you never to--

03:58.934 --> 04:00.718
Relax.
I was smooth.

04:00.805 --> 04:03.373
I said I liked his shoes,
especially the shoelaces.

04:03.460 --> 04:05.593
- Darby: Smart.
Butter him up.
- Jake: Exactly.

04:05.680 --> 04:07.247
It worked, too.
And then I asked him

04:07.334 --> 04:10.119
which cake mix
he thought was better.

04:10.206 --> 04:11.686
And then he told me
a secret.

04:14.428 --> 04:16.168
When he makes cupcakes,

04:16.255 --> 04:17.648
he uses water
instead of milk.

04:17.735 --> 04:19.041
Gross.

04:19.128 --> 04:20.390
He's cooking a spell,
I know it.

04:20.476 --> 04:22.087
Another spell
to win the lottery?

04:22.174 --> 04:24.829
No, I-- I think he's gonna
spell someone else.

04:26.570 --> 04:28.224
He's gonna give someone
a magical cupcake.

04:28.311 --> 04:29.747
Well, we have to
stop him.

04:29.834 --> 04:31.271
Who knows what he's
trying to do with it.

04:31.358 --> 04:32.576
You're right.
We may not have the book,

04:32.663 --> 04:34.274
but we're still
its protectors.

04:34.361 --> 04:36.232
We can't just let him
spell an innocent person.

04:36.319 --> 04:38.539
So we cook
non-magical cupcakes,

04:38.626 --> 04:40.323
and switch out the boxes
when he's not looking.

04:40.410 --> 04:42.673
Yeah.
That'll be easy.

04:42.760 --> 04:46.024
Come on,
it's done all the time
in heist movies.

04:46.111 --> 04:47.156

cake mix was it?

10:46.820 --> 10:48.517
But I was saying
good job.

10:48.604 --> 10:50.998
Tone down the sarcasm.

10:51.085 --> 10:52.564
Girl: And everybody
knows that

10:52.652 --> 10:54.044
Bartleby hasn't
spoken a word

10:54.131 --> 10:56.046
since his trip
to the Orient.

10:56.133 --> 10:58.440
Oh, well,
this is terrible.

10:58.527 --> 11:01.051
Hey, I'm still
learning my lines.

11:01.138 --> 11:03.010
Oh, I wasn't
talking to you.

11:04.228 --> 11:05.926
You don't have to be
so mean.

11:09.756 --> 11:11.671
Aren't you supposed to
meet your friend for lunch?

11:11.758 --> 11:13.150
Uh, yeah,
I'll meet her later.

11:13.237 --> 11:14.412
This is more important.

11:14.499 --> 11:16.588
- You sure?
- Yeah.

11:16.676 --> 11:18.503
But I still want lunch.

11:18.590 --> 11:20.723
Just wait 'til you see
the new hand dryer

11:20.810 --> 11:22.682
I had installed
in the bathroom.

11:22.769 --> 11:24.727
It has a special
UV filter

11:24.814 --> 11:26.686
that sanitizes.

11:26.773 --> 11:28.470
Sounds like something
I should put on my wish list.

11:28.557 --> 11:30.515
Sounds expensive.

11:30.602 --> 11:33.780
You know, I read somewhere
that money well spent

11:33.867 --> 11:34.824
is money earned.

11:34.911 --> 11:36.957
No, I read that.

11:37.044 --> 11:38.523
You told me
it was nonsense.

11:38.610 --> 11:41.352
[chuckles]
That doesn't sound like me.

11:43.485 --> 11:45.748
Well, I'm glad Mama P's
fixing up the place.

11:45.835 --> 11:48.664
Yeah, me too,
but it's not like her.

11:48.751 --> 11:50.710
That woman
does not like to spend
if she doesn't have to.

11:50.797 --> 11:52.189
She's always
up to something,
isn't she?

11:56.933 --> 11:58.239
Listen to this.

11:58.326 --> 12:00.328
"The Franklin's
of Saffron Bluffs

12:00.415 --> 12:01.938
"are proud to announce
the engagement

12:02.025 --> 12:03.679
"of their son Nick to his
long-time girlfriend

12:03.766 --> 12:04.724
"Alyssa Escovel."

12:04.811 --> 12:07.335
This must be our Alyssa.

12:07.422 --> 12:08.815
Oh, how nice.

12:08.902 --> 12:11.731
Nick and Alyssa are
finally engaged.

12:11.818 --> 12:13.689
- She waited long enough.
- Wait. You know them?

12:13.776 --> 12:16.170
Sure. She owns
the new yoga studio.

12:16.257 --> 12:19.086
Oh, Yoga Legends Studio.
Yeah, I've been dying to
try that place.

12:19.173 --> 12:22.219
Oh, and you know Nick.
He comes in here all the time.

12:22.306 --> 12:24.091
Macchiato and
biscotti to go.

12:24.178 --> 12:26.615
Oh, yeah,
double cup guy.

12:26.702 --> 12:27.790
I'd better call Kelly.

12:30.227 --> 12:32.316
This is just for
my own reference.

12:38.061 --> 12:42.109
Um, but it helps me get
a sense of you guys as
a family, so--

12:44.415 --> 12:47.854
Now, Terri, why don't you
tell us a little bit

12:47.941 --> 12:49.246
about what made you
run for mayor.

12:49.333 --> 12:52.249
Sure. Uh, it all started
when Buddy here

12:52.336 --> 12:55.339
narrowly escaped
being hit by a car.

12:55.426 --> 12:57.298
I became an advocate
for speed bumps,
and that--

12:57.385 --> 13:00.301
I-- I'm sorry.
Can we stop for a second?

13:00.388 --> 13:03.478
Kelly,
would you mind sitting up
a little straighter?

13:03.565 --> 13:05.045
Sure.

13:09.745 --> 13:11.138
[cell phone buzzing]

13:11.225 --> 13:13.096
Be right back.

13:16.839 --> 13:19.102
Sorry.

13:19.189 --> 13:21.104
Hannah: Okay,
here's what I have so far.

13:21.191 --> 13:22.976
Alyssa Escovel
just got engaged

13:23.063 --> 13:25.413
to a successful lawyer
from Saffron Bluffs, and--

13:25.500 --> 13:27.458
Why are you making
that face?

13:27.545 --> 13:29.983
What face?
I'm just listening to
what you're saying.

13:30.070 --> 13:32.028
What else
did you find out?

13:32.115 --> 13:33.900
I'm doing my best.
Calm down.

13:33.987 --> 13:36.728
- Huh?
- You were criticizing me.

13:36.816 --> 13:39.644
What's going on today?
My mom said that
I was being sarcastic,

13:39.731 --> 13:40.863
but I swear I wasn't.

13:40.950 --> 13:42.430
- Uh-oh.
- Oh, no.

13:42.517 --> 13:44.171
[cell phone buzzing]

13:44.258 --> 13:46.260
[sighs] You guys
aren't going to believe--

13:46.347 --> 13:48.349
Eww. Why are you
making that face?

13:48.436 --> 13:50.742
Well, why are you
making that face?

13:50.830 --> 13:53.049
You're both
making faces.

13:53.136 --> 13:54.572
I think you two
were spelled.

13:54.659 --> 13:56.923
What? I haven't eaten
anything today

13:57.010 --> 13:59.751
except for that
bag of cheese puffs
and that burrito.

13:59.839 --> 14:00.970
And that grapefruit.

14:01.057 --> 14:02.493
Okay, so I guess
I've eaten a lot.

14:02.580 --> 14:05.105
What? You don't have to judge me, Kelly.

14:05.192 --> 14:07.672
- I was smiling.
- You were?

14:07.759 --> 14:10.937
- What am I gonna do?
- I don't know but
stop yelling at me.

14:11.024 --> 14:13.200
I don't understand,
you're not spelled.

14:13.287 --> 14:15.332
RJ's cupcake.

14:15.419 --> 14:18.161
I'm the only one
that didn't touch it,
but you both did.

14:18.248 --> 14:20.033
You can get spelled
from touching something?

14:20.120 --> 14:21.599
That's big magic.

14:21.686 --> 14:25.516
Well,
if your skin can absorb
lotion and medicine,

14:25.603 --> 14:26.909
why not magic?

14:26.996 --> 14:28.476
It was probably
the powdered sugar.

14:28.563 --> 14:30.565
It cast some sort of
unlikability spell.

14:30.652 --> 14:33.307
You think Darby and I
are unlikable?

14:33.394 --> 14:35.875
Oh, yeah.
Big time.

14:35.962 --> 14:39.617
So RJ wanted to make
Alyssa unlikable
for some reason?

14:39.704 --> 14:41.532
I will try and figure out
what's going on,

14:41.619 --> 14:44.622
but in the meantime,
you two just try and
be extra nice.

14:44.709 --> 14:47.277
- Duh!
- I am trying.

14:47.364 --> 14:48.452
Oh, boy.

14:49.758 --> 14:50.715
[sighs]

14:55.068 --> 14:57.940
I can't believe we built
two flats today.

14:58.027 --> 14:59.246
Great job, Oren.

14:59.333 --> 15:02.597
- What?
- I said great job, Oren.

15:02.684 --> 15:04.468
Do you really think
you can do better than me?

15:04.555 --> 15:07.863
No, no. I don't think
I can do better than you.

15:13.695 --> 15:15.175
Maybe this is
more your speed.

15:20.267 --> 15:21.964
And are you all very involved
in the community?

15:22.051 --> 15:23.748
Absolutely.

15:23.835 --> 15:26.012
Last month, we had
a canned food drive
at school,

15:26.099 --> 15:28.101
and it was really fun.

15:28.188 --> 15:31.234
We made a real
difference.

15:31.321 --> 15:35.151
We spent the whole day
stacking bent cans.

15:35.238 --> 15:37.414
Kelly, you loved doing
the food drive.

15:37.501 --> 15:40.330
I'm so sorry.
I think she's just
camera shy.

15:40.417 --> 15:41.810
What are you doing?

15:41.897 --> 15:45.161
Uh--
What am I doing?

15:45.248 --> 15:47.033
[chuckles]
Kids.

15:47.120 --> 15:48.034
[groaning]

15:50.862 --> 15:53.865
So, you're writing an article
on luck for the school paper,

15:53.953 --> 15:55.606
and you want to
talk about RJ White?

15:55.693 --> 15:57.130
You know him,
right?

15:57.217 --> 15:58.392
Yeah, I knew him
in high school.

15:58.479 --> 16:00.481
We dated briefly.

16:00.568 --> 16:02.526
- You guys dated?
- Yeah, I still don't
know why.

16:02.613 --> 16:03.875
What do you mean?

16:03.963 --> 16:05.877
RJ was kind of
under the radar,
you know?

16:05.965 --> 16:08.924
And then one day
he became quarterback
of the football team,

16:09.011 --> 16:11.187
and suddenly
he was cool.

16:11.274 --> 16:12.754
And that's when
you dated him?

16:12.841 --> 16:16.453
I know, it's shallow,
but that's high school.

16:16.540 --> 16:18.325
The whole thing lasted
only six months.

16:18.412 --> 16:20.196
Pretty soon
he was kicked off
the football team,

16:20.283 --> 16:21.981
and faded back into
the woodwork.

16:22.068 --> 16:24.070
He spent
the rest of high school
in detention, I think.

16:24.157 --> 16:26.115
That doesn't seem
very lucky to me.

16:26.202 --> 16:28.074
You know, it's funny that
you're asking about him.

16:28.161 --> 16:29.727
He showed up
a couple weeks ago

16:29.814 --> 16:31.120
totally out of
the blue.

16:31.207 --> 16:32.208
Then, when he won
the lottery,

16:32.295 --> 16:34.384
he asked me to
go away to Europe.

16:34.471 --> 16:35.472
And what
did you say?

16:35.559 --> 16:37.257
I told him I was
engaged to Nick.

16:37.344 --> 16:40.173
He did not take that
very well.

16:40.260 --> 16:41.696
Wait. Who told you
I know him?

16:41.783 --> 16:44.220
Uh,
this has been so helpful.
Thank you so much.

16:45.874 --> 16:48.268
RJ tried to make
Alyssa unlikable

16:48.355 --> 16:49.660
so Nick would
break up with her.

16:49.747 --> 16:51.619
- That's cruel.
- And confusing.

16:51.706 --> 16:53.621
He stole our book
to get his girlfriend back?

16:53.708 --> 16:55.362
Well,
mystery solved.

16:55.449 --> 16:59.018
And, if you hurry,
you still have time
to make that movie.

16:59.105 --> 17:01.150
Uh...

17:01.237 --> 17:04.458
Caitlyn didn't
actually invite me.

17:04.545 --> 17:06.415
She said that
she would text,
but--

17:06.502 --> 17:08.417
Well, maybe it hasn't
come through yet.

17:08.505 --> 17:10.203
Nice try.

17:10.290 --> 17:12.422
The truth is,
I'm not exactly making

17:12.509 --> 17:15.685
a ton of friends
at Fox Canyon.

17:15.772 --> 17:17.210
It's really hard
being the new girl.

17:19.125 --> 17:21.518
Give it time.

17:21.605 --> 17:24.304
Remember when I started at
Rockbury in third grade?

17:24.391 --> 17:26.741
It took a long time before
anyone would talk to me.

17:26.828 --> 17:28.960
Yeah, I remember.
You were really weird.

17:29.048 --> 17:30.875
Okay, I'm trying to
make you feel better here.

17:30.962 --> 17:33.008
[chuckles]
I'm joking.

17:33.095 --> 17:34.662
It'll get better.

17:34.749 --> 17:36.577
I promise.

17:36.664 --> 17:38.535
Thanks.

17:39.449 --> 17:40.581
Jill: Terri, look.

17:40.668 --> 17:42.670
I love everything
about your platform.

17:42.757 --> 17:44.933
I think you're
a good candidate.

17:45.020 --> 17:46.152
But?

17:46.239 --> 17:48.371
But the angle
I was going to use was,

17:48.458 --> 17:49.851
"Terri Quinn.

17:49.938 --> 17:52.767
"Let her run your town
the way she runs her home."

17:52.854 --> 17:55.509
I really wanted to
focus on your family.

17:55.596 --> 17:57.337
And-- And they are
really great.

17:57.424 --> 17:59.904
But Kelly, you know,
I'm just not sure

17:59.991 --> 18:01.210
voters will relate
to her.

18:01.297 --> 18:03.082
She's acting
so weird today.

18:03.169 --> 18:05.040
She's usually
such a good girl.

18:05.127 --> 18:06.868
Perhaps the thought of
being in the public eye

18:06.955 --> 18:08.522
is bringing out
a bad side.

18:08.609 --> 18:10.828
I've seen it happen
before.

18:10.915 --> 18:12.569
[sighs]
It was unfair of me

18:12.656 --> 18:14.702
to bring my family
into politics.

18:14.789 --> 18:17.139
In fact--
Oh, I don't know.

18:17.226 --> 18:21.012
Maybe running for mayor
isn't such a good idea.

18:21.100 --> 18:24.059
Sleep on it.
We'll talk tomorrow.

18:24.146 --> 18:25.104
Okay.

18:29.760 --> 18:31.675
[whirring]

18:39.205 --> 18:41.555
Okay. I can't hold
my tongue any longer.

18:41.642 --> 18:43.818
That jack you built
is the wrong size.

18:43.905 --> 18:45.428
For a flat of
these dimensions,

18:45.515 --> 18:46.995
you're gonna need a jack
at least three feet deeper,

18:47.082 --> 18:48.692
and braceable
with sandbags.

18:48.779 --> 18:51.304
Otherwise,
when Lily Montgomery
slams the door in scene 3,

18:51.391 --> 18:53.523
the whole thing
is gonna come
tumbling down.

18:53.610 --> 18:56.222
I know you don't like me
because I'm an actor,
but guess what?

18:56.309 --> 18:57.484
I've been building stuff

18:57.571 --> 18:58.963
a lot longer than
I've been acting.

18:59.050 --> 19:01.531
And I'm really good at it.

19:01.618 --> 19:02.619
Give me that.

19:07.320 --> 19:09.931
[whirring]

19:10.018 --> 19:12.499
Oh, you're right.
I forgot about
the door slamming.

19:13.891 --> 19:15.197
Actors aren't useless.

19:15.284 --> 19:16.851
I know the script
inside out.

19:16.938 --> 19:18.157
And you know what?

19:18.244 --> 19:19.723
I don't care if
you don't like me.

19:19.810 --> 19:21.856
I'm just here to build
a beautiful set.

19:21.943 --> 19:24.859
And I can't do that if
your crew doesn't know
what they're doing.

19:24.946 --> 19:27.296
I guess I owe you
an apology.

19:27.383 --> 19:29.080
I don't need an apology.

19:29.168 --> 19:30.908
Just don't make me
sweep floors anymore.

19:30.995 --> 19:32.345
That I'm not good at.

19:32.432 --> 19:33.824
Well, I wish you'd
told me sooner.

19:33.911 --> 19:37.001
We could have used
someone with your skill.

19:37.088 --> 19:40.483
What if I said
you're doing a good job?

19:40.570 --> 19:43.225
Then I would say
thank you.

19:43.312 --> 19:44.966
Good.
Come help me with this.

19:46.620 --> 19:48.143
[whirring]

19:49.623 --> 19:50.885
Jill, wait.

19:52.408 --> 19:54.758
Please,
don't listen to my mom.

19:54.845 --> 19:56.717
She really wants
to be mayor.

19:56.804 --> 19:59.198
An election is hard on
the whole family.

19:59.285 --> 20:00.547
Maybe your mom
needs to wait

20:00.634 --> 20:01.852
'til you're past
your teenage years.

20:01.939 --> 20:04.203
That's crazy.
So I'm not perfect,

20:04.290 --> 20:05.769
but big deal.

20:05.856 --> 20:07.945
Every family knows
what teenagers are like.

20:08.032 --> 20:10.470
We can pose for
some fake photograph,

20:10.557 --> 20:12.211
and pretend like we're
a picture perfect family,

20:12.298 --> 20:14.038
but we're not.

20:14.125 --> 20:16.693
And that shouldn't
keep my mom
from doing her job.

20:16.780 --> 20:18.913
Because she's
really good.

20:19.000 --> 20:20.480
I don't care if
you don't like me,

20:20.567 --> 20:23.570
but give my mom
another chance.

20:23.657 --> 20:24.745
Look at it this way.

20:24.832 --> 20:26.747
If she can handle
a moody teenager,

20:26.834 --> 20:28.183
she can handle anything.

20:28.270 --> 20:30.229
Wow.

20:30.316 --> 20:32.709
I never thought about it
like that.

20:32.796 --> 20:35.843
You make some
valid points.

20:35.930 --> 20:38.237
And you're giving me
an idea.

20:38.324 --> 20:40.413
What if we play up
the millennial angle?

20:40.500 --> 20:43.024
We can even give her
a hashtag.

20:43.111 --> 20:45.113
Wait for it.

20:45.200 --> 20:47.507
Hashtag Quinning.

20:47.594 --> 20:49.160
- Get it?
- I love it.

20:49.248 --> 20:51.598
So you'll do it?

20:51.685 --> 20:53.208
Yes.

20:53.295 --> 20:55.863
And see?
If you just smile more,

20:55.950 --> 20:57.212
you're delightful.

20:57.299 --> 20:59.997
You can tell I'm smiling?

21:00.084 --> 21:01.260
Why wouldn't I?

21:05.873 --> 21:08.310
[bell jingles]

21:08.397 --> 21:09.877
Hi, girls.

21:09.964 --> 21:11.966
I'd love to sit around
and chat, but I'm late.

21:12.053 --> 21:13.402
Where are you going?

21:13.489 --> 21:14.969
I'm meeting
a landscaper.

21:15.056 --> 21:17.711
I'm thinking of putting
a little patio out back.

21:17.798 --> 21:20.235
Still on her
spending spree?

21:20.322 --> 21:22.150
Whatever Mama P wants,
Mama P gets.

21:22.237 --> 21:23.760
What are you guys
doing here?

21:23.847 --> 21:26.372
We need Elysian sugar to make
the spice detecting spell.

21:26.459 --> 21:28.156
Yeah, we need to find out
what RJ put in that cupcake

21:28.243 --> 21:29.505
to give us
the worst day ever.

21:29.592 --> 21:31.333
Oh, come on,
it wasn't that bad.

21:31.420 --> 21:33.988
It was that bad.

21:34.075 --> 21:35.032
Let's go get
the sugar.

21:38.471 --> 21:39.776
But if the spell
broke already,

21:39.863 --> 21:41.212
why do you need to know
what spice he used?

21:41.300 --> 21:42.866
This spell was
complicated.

21:42.953 --> 21:45.478
We've never been spelled
just by touching food.

21:45.565 --> 21:48.568
RJ clearly knows
a thing or two about magic.

21:48.655 --> 21:50.744
I be he used
carnesian something.

21:50.831 --> 21:52.572
Probably.

21:52.659 --> 21:55.488
Your spell broke when
you stopped caring if
Oren liked you.

21:55.575 --> 21:59.405
And your spell broke
when you stopped trying
to please Jill.

21:59.492 --> 22:01.363
Good old emotional
carnesian.

22:01.450 --> 22:04.235
But we didn't have any
carnesian in the doll house.

22:04.323 --> 22:05.672
We used them all up
already, remember?

22:07.587 --> 22:08.892
Ready?

22:14.724 --> 22:16.160
Darby: Whoa.

22:17.510 --> 22:19.294
Brown is definitely
carnesian.

22:19.381 --> 22:20.513
That means he has
access to spices.

22:20.600 --> 22:22.384
And knows
how to use them.

22:22.471 --> 22:25.344
Do you think that's
how he went from
a nobody in high school

22:25.431 --> 22:27.563
to a super star
almost over night?

22:27.650 --> 22:29.304
He had magic.

22:29.391 --> 22:31.393
And then
he didn't have it.

22:31.480 --> 22:34.004
Alyssa said that he faded
into the background again.

22:34.091 --> 22:36.180
I-- I don't
understand.

22:36.267 --> 22:38.835
I thought the only people
who had the book before us
were the OCs.

22:38.922 --> 22:41.142
Clearly, there were
others in between.

22:41.229 --> 22:45.625
Guys, I can't believe
I'm about to say this,
but...

22:45.712 --> 22:47.583
I think RJ
was a protector.
