Remember that time?

00:28.129 --> 00:29.728
Oh, I remember.

00:29.730 --> 00:32.031
Do you remember what she said?

00:32.033 --> 00:33.632
I remember.

00:33.634 --> 00:37.269
Do you remember
when we were remembering
the remembrance?

00:37.271 --> 00:39.271
You mean right now?

00:39.273 --> 00:40.372
Yes.

00:40.374 --> 00:42.474
ALL: We remember.

00:42.476 --> 00:44.877
Man, remembering is the best.

Reviving our stored
neutral pathways

00:47.248 --> 00:49.014
into coherent recollections.

00:49.016 --> 00:51.150
A nice little trip
down memory lane.

00:51.152 --> 00:53.652
Hey! You guys remember
where we like to go

00:53.654 --> 00:56.221
when remembering things
we like to remember?

00:56.223 --> 00:58.924
If I remember correctly...

00:58.926 --> 01:00.592
ALL: The attic!

01:06.399 --> 01:08.200
ALL: Whoa!

01:08.202 --> 01:11.603
I just remembered how I like
remembering all this stuff.

01:11.605 --> 01:15.007
Then why is it stored here,
away from us?

01:15.009 --> 01:17.643
Because you gots
to forget about it first,

01:17.645 --> 01:21.113
so's you can remember
it's later, girl. Duh.

01:21.115 --> 01:24.616
Speaking of forgetting,
are you forgetting
why we came up here?

01:24.618 --> 01:26.852
-We remember.
-To remember.

01:26.854 --> 01:29.154
-Remember.
-Remember.

01:29.156 --> 01:31.757
Then let us do the dusting off
of these boxes

01:31.759 --> 01:34.793
so we can access
the remembrances.

01:38.232 --> 01:41.033

01:42.769 --> 01:44.369
You know, from Episode One.

01:44.371 --> 01:45.671
Dude, you kept that thing?

01:45.673 --> 01:48.774
-That was many episodes ago.
-Ew.

Gah! The past?
You have to focus on the now!

02:44.765 --> 02:47.933
What's the big deal?
We're just taking a little
trip down memory lane.

02:47.935 --> 02:52.070
Yeah, man, these
boxes are filled
with good re-memories.

02:52.072 --> 02:53.071
Remember this sandwich?

02:53.073 --> 02:56.742
Wow, so interesting.
Garbage!

02:56.744 --> 02:58.577
Well, we're about
to open this one.

02:58.579 --> 03:00.312

excited about that!

No, no, no, no, no!

03:03.816 --> 03:06.518
Green undies and elf boots?

03:06.520 --> 03:11.590
(GASPS) You killed a
Christmas elf and stuffed
his body in that box?

03:12.325 --> 03:13.458
That's cold.

03:13.460 --> 03:15.027
Don't be ridiculous.

03:15.029 --> 03:18.530
Yeah, Beastie, obviously
Robin didn't kill
a Christmas elf.

03:18.532 --> 03:22.501
He's just hiding
the fact that he used
to be a Christmas elf.

-(BOTH GASP)
-Is it super-cold

(YELLING) I am not an elf!

03:28.309 --> 03:30.809
This was my first costume.

03:30.811 --> 03:32.945
Woah, you wore
these in public?

03:32.947 --> 03:38.817
For years! So trust me when
I say that the past is filled
with pain and regret.

03:38.819 --> 03:40.886
Nothing good
comes from history.

03:40.888 --> 03:42.988
Holding onto the past
limits our future.

03:42.990 --> 03:46.225
Robin, without the past,
there is no future.

03:48.094 --> 03:51.029
(SARCASTICALLY) Wow,
that's so deep, Raven.

03:51.031 --> 03:52.531

of this junk!

04:09.717 --> 04:11.850
tricking people into
buying your garbage?

04:11.852 --> 04:13.385
This isn't garbage.

04:13.387 --> 04:15.387
Of course it is.

04:15.389 --> 04:17.656
And for whatever reason,
people want to buy it
when it's randomly strewn

04:17.658 --> 04:18.757
across your wet lawn.

04:18.759 --> 04:20.058
This stuff may be garbage,

04:20.060 --> 04:21.893
but it's still
important to us.

04:21.895 --> 04:25.764
And, the future is nothing
without the past.

04:27.267 --> 04:29.701
Stop saying meaningless
phrases that sound deep.

04:29.703 --> 04:31.136
Okay, here come the weirdos.

04:31.138 --> 04:32.638
We have to sell this trash
and sell it fast.

04:32.640 --> 04:34.273

all sales are final.

05:08.242 --> 05:11.643
All our cherished memories
amount to pocket change?

05:11.645 --> 05:15.814

almost 12 bucks to haul
away our garbage.

is acting weird.

without the past
there is no future.

I just thought you were
pretending to be deep.

05:38.939 --> 05:41.773
So selling our old stuff
made time stop?

05:41.775 --> 05:43.875
Yes, the weight
of all those items

05:43.877 --> 05:46.211
creates the momentum
that moves time forward.

05:46.213 --> 05:49.448
Without those items,
time cannot progress.

05:49.450 --> 05:51.116
Well, let's just take
our precious treasures back

05:51.118 --> 05:52.651
and get some time
momentum going!

of the garage sale is clear.

to retrieve the items and
restore the flows of time.

used to hang out there?

still exist here.
