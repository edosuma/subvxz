00:20.012 --> 00:21.282
That's disgusting.

00:22.454 --> 00:25.303
- Want some?
- Hit me.

00:28.402 --> 00:29.631
See?

00:29.751 --> 00:31.722
<i>Constantly learning</i>
<i>something new.</i>

00:31.756 --> 00:33.730
Today's lesson:
Always get dressed for work

00:33.765 --> 00:35.637
after you give the baby a bath.

00:35.671 --> 00:36.907
Say good morning to Tucker

00:36.941 --> 00:37.910
and your Uncle Danny.

00:37.944 --> 00:39.916
- Hi, baby.
- ( Babbles )

00:39.950 --> 00:42.821
Okay, so I think
we're officially

00:42.856 --> 00:45.329
out of everything with
the word "baby" in it.

00:45.931 --> 00:46.966
Where's the list?

00:47.000 --> 00:48.869
What list?

00:48.904 --> 00:50.741
The one we should have started

00:50.776 --> 00:52.745
before we ran out
of everything.

00:55.307 --> 00:57.020
Why can't you just ask your mom

00:57.055 --> 00:59.892
- to go pick up some stuff?
- Oh, no no no no no.

00:59.927 --> 01:01.729
There will be no asking
the mom anything.

01:01.763 --> 01:03.632
She already thinks
I'm making a huge mistake,

01:03.667 --> 01:04.733
that I'm too irresponsible.

01:04.769 --> 01:06.537
So I'd like to
get a handle on this

01:06.572 --> 01:07.639
before she hits me with a giant

01:07.674 --> 01:08.975
"I told you so."

01:09.010 --> 01:10.946
Then get ready to be smacked,

01:10.980 --> 01:12.782
because I'm pretty sure
she's on her way over.

01:13.885 --> 01:15.955
What? Here, now?
Why do you think that?

01:15.989 --> 01:18.893
Because when I told her
you decided to keep Emma,

01:18.927 --> 01:20.762
all I heard was
"Oh, dear lord,"

01:20.797 --> 01:21.830
the phone hit the floor

01:21.864 --> 01:22.864
and tires squealing,

01:22.899 --> 01:24.968
so I kind of put
two and two together.

01:25.002 --> 01:26.972
Okay. Uh,
we gotta clean up.

01:27.006 --> 01:28.807
No, change the baby.

01:28.842 --> 01:31.578
No, I just did that.
A schedule.

01:31.612 --> 01:33.581
She's crazy
about having a plan.

01:33.616 --> 01:34.583
Okay, I've got a day shift,

01:34.617 --> 01:35.651
so I can be
home by 6:00.

01:35.685 --> 01:36.886
Sorry, but I'm heading
down to the rink.

01:36.920 --> 01:39.690
And it's emasculation
Saturday with Vanessa.

01:43.732 --> 01:44.899
I think we're sham shopping.

01:46.903 --> 01:49.906
Guys, come on.

01:49.940 --> 01:51.775
I really want to
prove mom wrong.

01:51.809 --> 01:53.878
I want to show her
I can be a good dad.

01:55.915 --> 01:57.082
Where's Emma?

- Emma?

02:14.840 --> 02:15.840
Emma? Found her!

02:15.874 --> 02:16.908
Under the table. Wait,

02:16.942 --> 02:17.976
here is my retainer.

02:18.010 --> 02:20.545
I have been looking
everywhere for this.

02:20.579 --> 02:21.813
Okay.

02:21.848 --> 02:22.948
Be careful.
Grab this end.

02:22.982 --> 02:24.015
All right?
On three.

02:24.050 --> 02:25.751
One, two, three.

02:37.800 --> 02:40.603
Yeah, you really should
get used to hearing that.

02:41.805 --> 02:43.873
Just playing a little hide and seek.
( Chuckles )

02:43.908 --> 02:45.843
Oh, there you are, Emma.

02:45.877 --> 02:47.044
You're such a good hider.

02:47.079 --> 02:48.747
Honey, she's not hiding,

02:48.781 --> 02:49.982
she's trying to escape.

02:51.885 --> 02:53.853
But don't you worry,
little Emma.

02:53.887 --> 02:56.857
Your fairy grandmother
is here to save you.

02:56.891 --> 02:58.792
Emma doesn't need to be saved.

02:58.826 --> 02:59.960
I've got this under control.

02:59.994 --> 03:02.730
Once again, it's going
to be up to me

03:02.765 --> 03:03.931
to bail you out.

03:03.966 --> 03:04.932
At least this time,

03:04.967 --> 03:06.968
I don't have to fly to Mexico.

03:09.672 --> 03:11.806
That was a good trip.

03:11.841 --> 03:13.741
You know I hate to say

03:13.776 --> 03:14.943
"I told you so," but--

03:14.977 --> 03:17.812
Mom, there is gonna be
no "I told you so" this time.

03:17.847 --> 03:19.715
You know, unless it's me
saying it to you.

03:19.749 --> 03:21.850
So you're telling me
you've worked out a plan

03:21.885 --> 03:24.687
- to take care of this baby.
- ( Scoffs ) Yeah.

03:24.721 --> 03:25.921
I was just working it out
with the guys.

03:25.956 --> 03:27.656
- Bonnie: <i>Oh.</i>
<i>- Just give me a second.</i>

03:29.860 --> 03:31.561
Please help me.

03:31.595 --> 03:33.029
( Whispering )

03:36.868 --> 03:38.803
Fine. I've got her
this morning.

03:38.837 --> 03:40.871
And I am taking her out
this afternoon.

03:40.906 --> 03:43.608
And I've got her tonight,
which is what we like to call

03:43.642 --> 03:45.043
a <i>plan!</i>

03:46.612 --> 03:48.013
Yeah, hold up there,
chip and Dale.

03:52.674 --> 03:55.576
Just so you know, if anything

03:55.610 --> 03:57.645
happens to my granddaughter,

03:57.679 --> 03:58.813
you're both dead men.

04:01.316 --> 04:03.751
Which is what I like
to call a <i>threat.</i>

04:08.756 --> 04:10.657
All right, Emma.

04:10.692 --> 04:13.627
I think we've got everything.

04:13.661 --> 04:16.728
Do I really need to take
all the baby stuff?

04:16.764 --> 04:18.297
Dude, you're gonna be gone

04:18.331 --> 04:19.731
for four or five hours.

04:19.766 --> 04:21.533
Just take a diaper
and a bottle.

04:21.567 --> 04:22.567
( Chuckles )

04:25.370 --> 04:27.571
<i>( Cell phone ringing )</i>

04:27.605 --> 04:29.506
- ( Beeps )
- Hey, man, what's going on?

04:29.540 --> 04:31.408
This plan is not working.

04:31.442 --> 04:33.476
I'm out of food,
her diaper's history,

04:33.510 --> 04:34.710
and the new one's
gonna blow any minute.

04:34.745 --> 04:36.479
And apparently
there's some new rule

04:36.513 --> 04:38.547
about bringing babies
into the locker room.

04:38.581 --> 04:41.383
Hey, buddy, why don't you put
a towel on or something?

04:41.417 --> 04:42.717
I got a baby over here.

04:42.751 --> 04:45.686
Rude! You gotta
get over here, now.

04:45.720 --> 04:47.688
I-- I can't right now.

04:47.722 --> 04:49.756
Okay, hang on one second.

04:49.791 --> 04:52.525
What? Okay.
I'm on my way. Okay?

04:53.527 --> 04:55.328
( Scoffs )

04:55.362 --> 04:56.796
Why is it always up to Tucker

04:56.830 --> 04:58.730
to save the day?
( Chuckles )

04:58.765 --> 05:00.698
<i>( Cell phone rings )</i>

05:00.733 --> 05:03.501
- Hey, Tuck, what's going on?
- I cannot do this, okay?

05:03.535 --> 05:05.669
I've got a lap full of pee,
and it isn't even mine.

05:07.772 --> 05:09.572
Hey! I could really
use a diaper out here

05:09.607 --> 05:11.341
and I know
one of y'all is holding.

05:12.576 --> 05:14.610
$20 for a diaper, miss.
Please? Baby or senior,

05:14.645 --> 05:16.712
at this point, it really don't matter.
Where you going?

05:20.316 --> 05:22.284
I'm sorry. I came as soon
as I got your message.

05:22.318 --> 05:23.352
Is everything okay?

05:23.386 --> 05:24.619
Ben:
Yeah, she's fine.

05:24.654 --> 05:28.589
Though I should remind you,
complete stranger,

05:28.624 --> 05:31.459
that we're not
a daycare center.

05:34.429 --> 05:35.696
( Whispers ) I'm five minutes
away from getting fired

05:35.730 --> 05:37.397
if anyone finds out
she's really my baby.

05:38.666 --> 05:40.600
I've been telling my boss
the mom's outside smoking

05:40.635 --> 05:42.402
for the last hour.

05:44.705 --> 05:46.505
Double Margarita, rocks.

05:46.540 --> 05:48.741
So, apparently, I'm a bad mom

05:48.775 --> 05:50.476
with a drinking problem.

05:52.679 --> 05:54.379
What the hell.

05:56.381 --> 05:57.515
I know, I know.
I'm sorry.

05:57.549 --> 05:58.782
I just have to get this right.

05:58.817 --> 06:01.318
Don't worry, Emma.
Daddy will figure this out.

06:04.321 --> 06:06.555
And he'll be right back. Can
you watch Emma for a sec?

06:09.525 --> 06:11.392
Wow. Wouldn't
have pegged her

06:11.427 --> 06:12.760
for a parenting expert.

06:14.363 --> 06:16.397
<i>Please?</i>
<i>Her name's Chloe.</i>

06:16.431 --> 06:18.533
She comes in every
Saturday for crab cakes.

06:18.567 --> 06:20.401
And if you've ever had ours,

06:20.435 --> 06:22.737
you'd know that's not why she's
really here. ( Chuckles )

06:24.506 --> 06:26.573
Oh, crapballs.

06:27.675 --> 06:30.343
- Hey, Benji.
- Hey.

06:30.378 --> 06:31.611
Has anyone seen Emma?

06:33.345 --> 06:36.478
( Gasps ) Oh, there she is.

06:36.512 --> 06:39.612
Oh, wow, you're right.
She really is a good hider.

06:39.646 --> 06:40.679
Mom.

06:40.713 --> 06:42.677
I guess I missed out
on the part of the plan

06:42.712 --> 06:44.542
where she hangs out
with the bar snacks.

06:46.511 --> 06:48.711
Oh, no, there's a baby
in my beer nuts.

06:52.615 --> 06:54.649
Something came up, okay?

06:54.684 --> 06:57.419
But like any good plan,
I had a plan B,

06:57.453 --> 06:59.387
also known as Riley.

07:01.356 --> 07:03.457
Words every girl
just lives to hear.

07:05.727 --> 07:08.529
So as you can see, we've got
this all under control.

07:08.563 --> 07:11.598
- Did you want something?
- Yeah, I actually wanted to talk about

07:11.633 --> 07:13.400
that sweet little
angel's future.

07:13.434 --> 07:15.569
I was thinking about
redoing my will--

07:15.603 --> 07:17.570
you know, setting up
a college savings account.

07:17.605 --> 07:20.340
You know, you really
can't be too proactive.

07:20.374 --> 07:22.408
Actually I've been taking
this estate planning class--

07:22.442 --> 07:24.510
Oh my God.

07:24.545 --> 07:27.312
I just had an amazing idea.

07:30.750 --> 07:33.351
That Riley should help you
with your estate planning,

07:33.385 --> 07:35.619
thus saving you money and giving
her some real world experience?

07:35.653 --> 07:37.321
That is an amazing idea.

07:38.523 --> 07:40.591
Why don't you two discuss
that while I go on break?

07:43.294 --> 07:45.561
I actually was gonna say, "Why
don't we order some fried things?"

07:45.596 --> 07:47.730
But I like his idea better.

07:47.764 --> 07:49.431
- Gonna finish that?
- Yeah.

07:49.465 --> 07:50.632
Okay.

08:04.414 --> 08:05.514
All right, she's out.

08:05.548 --> 08:07.249
( Sighs ) There's nothing cuter

08:07.283 --> 08:08.417
than a sleeping baby.

08:08.451 --> 08:09.551
Yeah, it's when they're awake

08:09.585 --> 08:10.652
you gotta watch your back.

08:12.521 --> 08:14.455
Yeah, they suck you in
with their cuteness

08:14.490 --> 08:16.224
and then once
they got you-- bam!

08:16.258 --> 08:18.259
--Fluids are flying everywhere.

08:21.598 --> 08:23.431
Oh. I'm so glad
you're all here.

08:23.466 --> 08:25.300
Uh, this is perfect.

08:25.334 --> 08:27.369
So a little change of plans.

08:27.403 --> 08:28.670
I know it was my turn
with Emma tonight,

08:28.704 --> 08:31.473
but crab cake Chloe
just invited me over

08:31.507 --> 08:33.341
to get to know
each other a little better,

08:33.375 --> 08:34.542
if you know what I mean.

08:34.577 --> 08:36.477
Well, you're
on your own tonight.

08:36.511 --> 08:39.024
- Tough break, dad.
- I hope she likes kids.

08:41.751 --> 08:44.184
So obviously
you don't know what I mean.

08:47.766 --> 08:50.071
Wait, where are you going?

08:50.311 --> 08:51.445
Did you all miss the part

08:51.479 --> 08:53.446
where she said she wants
to get to know me better?

08:55.282 --> 08:57.516
No. But you obviously
missed the part

08:57.551 --> 08:59.251
where we don't care.

09:02.221 --> 09:03.988
And also the part

09:04.022 --> 09:06.188
where I had to
throw out my pants.

09:08.321 --> 09:10.016
<i>Please,</i> guys?

09:10.136 --> 09:13.022
I'll be quick.
Well, not that quick.

09:14.424 --> 09:16.991
Well, if someone hadn't
already committed me

09:17.026 --> 09:18.259
to a fun-filled evening

09:18.294 --> 09:20.194
of helping his mother
with her will...

09:22.430 --> 09:24.364
Sorry about that.

09:24.399 --> 09:27.400
So probably not a good time
to ask for another favor.

09:27.435 --> 09:29.335
But if you could try
to wedge in a word or two

09:29.370 --> 09:31.037
about how great
I'm doing with Emma,

09:31.071 --> 09:32.271
you know, how responsible I am?

09:32.306 --> 09:34.206
So you want me to lie?

09:36.076 --> 09:37.243
Look, you're right.

09:37.277 --> 09:40.012
I said I'll figure
this out and I will.

09:40.046 --> 09:42.281
- I promise.
- Good man.

09:42.315 --> 09:44.049
<i>( Elevator dings )</i>

09:45.485 --> 09:48.353
But you two, not so fast.

09:48.387 --> 09:51.122
You just said you were
gonna figure it out.

09:51.156 --> 09:52.390
And that's what I'm doing.

09:52.424 --> 09:54.158
Come on, guys.
I've been working on Chloe

09:54.193 --> 09:55.459
for, like, five weeks.

09:55.494 --> 09:57.361
Okay, look,
you can probably tell

09:57.396 --> 09:59.297
from the extra hair product

09:59.331 --> 10:01.366
and the fact that
the big guy showered,

10:03.269 --> 10:05.070
that we have plans.

10:05.104 --> 10:06.271
Sorry, little bro.

10:06.306 --> 10:08.173
Work this one out on your own.

10:08.208 --> 10:10.075
I can't believe you're
gonna make me do it.

10:10.109 --> 10:12.244
I'm invoking the bro code.

10:19.118 --> 10:20.252
Are you serious?

10:20.286 --> 10:22.320
June 21st, 2010,

10:22.354 --> 10:24.422
who covered for you when
Vanessa caught you flirting

10:24.457 --> 10:26.391
with that unnaturally
enhanced waitress, huh?

10:27.427 --> 10:29.495
Senior year,
who told Jessica Feltshank

10:29.529 --> 10:31.330
that you were sick in bed when,
in fact, you were having

10:31.364 --> 10:33.365
carnal knowledge of her sister
in our tree house?

10:35.201 --> 10:38.337
Answer to both?
I did.

10:38.372 --> 10:42.075
Fine. Just go.

10:42.109 --> 10:44.344
Yes! Don't wait up.

10:46.413 --> 10:48.448
And remember, she needs
a second bottle around 10:00.

10:54.121 --> 10:55.355
I hate that code.

10:57.492 --> 11:00.126
I loved that tree house.

11:03.497 --> 11:07.067
Oh, do you just believe that after all
these years we would be here together?

11:07.101 --> 11:09.270
Yep. Life is...
♪ funny. ♪

11:11.306 --> 11:12.507
So if you have all the info,

11:12.541 --> 11:14.308
- we should be able--
- Oh, here.

11:17.245 --> 11:20.314
I like to stay organized, so I keep
all my important papers together.

11:22.184 --> 11:24.219
Oh, honestly, Riley,

11:24.253 --> 11:26.221
where did I go wrong?

11:26.255 --> 11:28.523
Wow, so many ways
to go with that.

11:28.557 --> 11:31.125
I meant with Ben.

11:32.394 --> 11:34.128
Well, I think
he turned out all right.

11:34.163 --> 11:35.496
In fact,

11:35.530 --> 11:37.464
he's one of the most
responsible young men

11:37.499 --> 11:40.068
- I've ever met.
- Oh.

11:40.102 --> 11:42.404
I'm sorry, I didn't know we were
drinking before this meeting.

11:44.140 --> 11:47.242
Well, he is sitting
at home on a Saturday night

11:47.277 --> 11:49.278
taking care of his daughter.

11:49.313 --> 11:51.514
That sounds awfully
responsible to me.

11:52.550 --> 11:54.117
Hi.

11:54.152 --> 11:55.519
For you, and I'm
pretty sure it's good

11:55.553 --> 11:58.289
because it's from a place I can't
pronounce and it has a cork.

11:58.323 --> 12:01.125
Nice. I'll get
some glasses.

12:01.160 --> 12:03.261
- All right.
- Make yourself comfortable.

12:08.200 --> 12:09.434
Wow, your place is really...

12:11.070 --> 12:12.204
Efficient.

12:14.074 --> 12:15.441
So is there a separate...

12:15.475 --> 12:17.043
Sleeping area?

12:17.077 --> 12:19.111
<i>The futon flips out into a bed.</i>

12:19.145 --> 12:22.047
<i>I hope you didn't think</i>
<i>I was too forward</i>

12:22.082 --> 12:23.315
<i>by asking you to come over.</i>

12:23.349 --> 12:25.484
Forward is
my favorite direction.

12:25.518 --> 12:27.519
<i>So many guys</i>
<i>get the wrong idea.</i>

12:27.553 --> 12:30.489
<i>They just automatically</i>
<i>assume you want to hook up.</i>

12:30.523 --> 12:32.357
<i>It's so nice</i>
<i>to finally meet a guy</i>

12:32.391 --> 12:33.525
<i>who's not like that.</i>

12:41.100 --> 12:42.267
See, the trouble with Ben is,

12:42.301 --> 12:43.501
he's exactly like his father,

12:43.536 --> 12:45.336
Danny Sr.

12:45.371 --> 12:47.438
( Groans ) Now there was a man

12:47.473 --> 12:50.341
who was clinically allergic
to responsibility.

12:52.444 --> 12:54.345
I liked Mr. Wheeler.

12:54.379 --> 12:56.147
God, he always put on the best

12:56.181 --> 12:58.082
4th of July fireworks displays.

12:58.117 --> 13:01.219
He has no eyebrows, and only
four fingers on his right hand.

13:04.123 --> 13:05.424
I was lucky he could sign

13:05.459 --> 13:07.230
the divorce papers.

13:07.264 --> 13:08.466
( Sighs )

13:08.500 --> 13:11.036
But with a father like that,

13:11.070 --> 13:14.206
it meant that I had to be
the responsible parent.

13:14.240 --> 13:16.341
The role model.

13:16.375 --> 13:18.277
Who's Larry Hoffman?

13:18.311 --> 13:19.344
What? Why? No,
I've never heard of--

13:19.379 --> 13:20.512
No no no, give me that.

13:20.546 --> 13:22.247
- ( Chuckling )
- Give it, give it, give it!

13:24.183 --> 13:26.485
That's funny
that you don't know him,

13:26.519 --> 13:30.088
because it says here
that you two were married

13:30.123 --> 13:33.458
in Vegas when you were 18.

13:35.394 --> 13:37.296
I really am sorry
about your futon.

13:37.330 --> 13:39.064
I certainly don't want
you to get the impression

13:39.098 --> 13:41.366
- that I'm one of those guys.
- My only impression so far

13:41.401 --> 13:44.069
is that you're a horrible liar.

13:44.103 --> 13:45.371
Which, if you think about it

13:45.405 --> 13:47.406
- is a good thing.
- Huh?

13:47.440 --> 13:49.374
I mean, who'd want
to go out with a good liar?

13:49.409 --> 13:51.476
( Chuckles ) Not me.

13:51.510 --> 13:54.479
Definitely something
for the plus column.

13:55.481 --> 13:57.081
Well, if there's
anything I can do

13:57.116 --> 13:59.383
- to help that total--
- There might be

13:59.417 --> 14:01.417
one or two things.

14:03.353 --> 14:05.021
That's not your baby, is it?

14:05.055 --> 14:07.456
What? Oh God, no.
Could you imagine?

14:07.491 --> 14:10.126
Shoot me.
( Chuckles )

14:10.161 --> 14:11.428
It's my sister's.

14:11.462 --> 14:14.064
- Why?
- Oh, no reason.

14:14.099 --> 14:16.100
- She's cute.
- ( Chuckles )

14:17.236 --> 14:18.403
Good night, Emma.

14:21.207 --> 14:22.473
Hey, Tuck, I was thinking.

14:22.508 --> 14:25.143
There's really no reason
we both need to stay in tonight,

14:25.177 --> 14:26.244
so I'm out of here.

14:31.517 --> 14:33.418
So I divorced Larry,

14:33.452 --> 14:36.120
I rushed home
and I married Danny Sr,

14:36.154 --> 14:38.322
which is what I should have
done in the first place.

14:38.356 --> 14:41.459
So, oddly,
if this hadn't happened,

14:41.493 --> 14:44.295
your two greatest accomplishments
never would have been created.

14:44.329 --> 14:46.197
How did you know
about my tattoos?

14:47.232 --> 14:49.433
I'm talking
about Danny and Ben.

14:49.468 --> 14:51.402
Your sons never
would have been born.

14:51.436 --> 14:53.437
That's a really good point,

14:53.472 --> 14:55.172
but maybe next time
you could try it

14:55.207 --> 14:57.074
without the sledgehammer.

14:57.109 --> 14:58.509
Even I can tell

14:58.544 --> 15:01.278
that you're being especially
hard on Ben lately.

15:02.280 --> 15:03.314
I mean, I know he'd hate me

15:03.348 --> 15:05.249
for telling you this,

15:05.284 --> 15:06.417
but he could really
use your help.

15:06.451 --> 15:08.148
Well, I am trying to.

15:08.183 --> 15:10.316
- He won't let me.
- Maybe because it's not worth

15:10.350 --> 15:12.351
the "I told you so"
that always comes with it.

15:12.385 --> 15:14.286
Well, I'm a mother.
It's a package deal.

15:15.422 --> 15:17.422
Well, you didn't
get to be a mom

15:17.457 --> 15:20.224
without making a few
mistakes, Mrs. Hoffman.

15:22.127 --> 15:23.394
So, maybe if you could admit

15:23.428 --> 15:25.129
that you weren't
always so perfect

15:25.163 --> 15:27.197
Ben could admit
that he needs help.

15:27.232 --> 15:29.065
You're just not gonna
let it go, are you?

15:29.100 --> 15:30.500
Not until you go talk to him.

15:32.136 --> 15:33.169
He needs you.

15:34.238 --> 15:36.305
Thanks, Riley.

15:36.339 --> 15:38.140
You know, you've
turned out to be

15:38.174 --> 15:40.308
a pretty smart young lady.

15:40.342 --> 15:42.476
I think you might
just make a go of this.

15:42.510 --> 15:44.411
- Being a lawyer?
- No, keeping the weight off.

15:44.445 --> 15:46.179
You barely touched
the cheese board.

15:51.518 --> 15:53.252
Ben honey, we need to talk.

15:56.289 --> 15:57.489
Ben?

16:04.195 --> 16:06.296
Oh hey, princess.

16:06.331 --> 16:08.165
<i>Oh, you're taking a nap.</i>

16:10.301 --> 16:12.169
Hey, big guy,
there's really no reason

16:12.204 --> 16:14.338
we both need to
stay in tonight, right?

16:14.372 --> 16:16.373
So, um, see you!

16:21.346 --> 16:22.513
Hello?

16:25.184 --> 16:26.384
Is anyone here?

16:29.154 --> 16:30.388
Ben?

16:30.422 --> 16:33.124
Danny?
The other one?

16:36.062 --> 16:37.463
Oh, this is gonna be the mother

16:37.497 --> 16:39.465
of all "I told you so"s.

16:46.602 --> 16:47.835
Is everything okay?

16:47.870 --> 16:49.704
I can't stop
thinking about Emma.

16:49.738 --> 16:50.905
Of course.

16:50.940 --> 16:52.840
Married, gay,
commitment issues--

16:52.875 --> 16:54.675
it's always something.

16:54.710 --> 16:56.139
No no, it's not that.

16:56.289 --> 16:59.191
Emma's my daughter.
I have a daughter.

16:59.225 --> 17:00.751
She was that little girl
at the bar today.

17:01.075 --> 17:02.568
Look, I know
I should have told you.

17:02.688 --> 17:04.228
I guess I was just afraid
that I wouldn't be here

17:04.262 --> 17:06.064
doing this with you
now if I had.

17:07.200 --> 17:09.233
Hey, it's okay.

17:09.269 --> 17:11.103
It's actually another thing

17:11.137 --> 17:12.270
for the plus column.

17:12.304 --> 17:15.142
- Really?
- Really.

17:17.040 --> 17:18.272
Do you want to see her picture?

17:18.307 --> 17:20.474
- Sure.
- ( Chuckles )

17:22.478 --> 17:25.079
I think she rolled over for
the first time this morning.

17:25.114 --> 17:27.114
- ( Chuckles )
- You know, maybe I'll call

17:27.148 --> 17:28.248
and check in
and then I'll be fine.

17:30.151 --> 17:33.052
- ( Rings )
- <i>( Dance music playing )</i>

17:33.087 --> 17:34.320
Danny, where are you?

17:34.354 --> 17:36.388
Hey, man. I just met a
couple of my new teammates

17:36.422 --> 17:38.423
- out for a drink.
- Ben: <i>Where's Emma?</i>

17:38.458 --> 17:41.193
Oh, she's totally conked out.
Tucker has it covered.

17:41.227 --> 17:42.394
( Laughs )

17:42.428 --> 17:44.262
I thought you were--

17:44.296 --> 17:46.430
Never mind.
Two seconds.

17:49.266 --> 17:50.500
Hey, Tuck,
I was just--

17:50.534 --> 17:53.102
<i>( bowling pins clatter )</i>
<i>- Are you bowling?</i>

17:53.136 --> 17:54.403
Where's Emma?!

17:54.438 --> 17:56.439
- Oh. I gotta go.
- ( Beeps )

17:57.507 --> 17:59.441
Emma, it's okay, daddy's here.

18:04.479 --> 18:07.147
Oh my God, Emma, where are you?

18:07.181 --> 18:09.182
Oh my God. No no no.
This can't be happening.

18:09.216 --> 18:12.051
- Oh my God.
- Looking for someone?

18:13.086 --> 18:15.321
Emma.
Thank God you're okay.

18:15.355 --> 18:19.324
I am so so sorry.
( Sighs )

18:19.359 --> 18:21.226
I thought I might
never see you again.

18:22.428 --> 18:25.463
I never want you out
of my sight, ever. Okay?

18:27.332 --> 18:29.066
I'm the worst father
in the world.

18:33.438 --> 18:35.139
Riley, can you take Emma?

18:39.077 --> 18:40.377
Come here, baby.

18:52.488 --> 18:55.423
I'm ready.
Let me have it.

18:55.457 --> 18:58.025
But just know that
nothing you can say to me

18:58.059 --> 19:00.994
can be any worse than what I'm
already saying to myself.

19:01.996 --> 19:04.296
Actually, Ben.

19:04.331 --> 19:06.198
All I wanted to say

19:06.232 --> 19:08.366
is that I'm proud of you.

19:08.401 --> 19:10.135
( Sniffles )

19:10.169 --> 19:13.337
Did you miss the part
where my baby got left alone?

19:15.440 --> 19:18.241
I once left Danny at a
Wal-Mart when he was two.

19:21.178 --> 19:23.379
- What happened?
- He was never seen again.

19:23.413 --> 19:24.480
( Mouths )

19:29.351 --> 19:32.486
My point--
I made mistakes.

19:34.022 --> 19:35.088
But that feeling?

19:36.090 --> 19:37.323
That gut-wrenching,

19:37.357 --> 19:39.158
heart-stopping,

19:39.192 --> 19:41.127
if-anything-
happens-to-my-child-

19:41.161 --> 19:42.328
I-think-I-will-die feeling--

19:42.362 --> 19:44.296
what you just had-- that?

19:44.330 --> 19:48.098
That is what let's you know
that you're a parent.

19:48.133 --> 19:50.267
And, honey, I guarantee
that you will do anything

19:50.301 --> 19:52.369
to make sure that
you never feel that again.

19:55.239 --> 19:57.340
So congratulations,

19:57.375 --> 19:59.375
now you're a dad.

20:02.112 --> 20:04.445
And I think you're
gonna be a pretty great one.

20:07.249 --> 20:08.382
But I don't know
what I'm doing.

20:08.416 --> 20:10.350
I know I said I got this,

20:10.385 --> 20:13.386
but I just <i>so</i> don't got this.

20:14.454 --> 20:17.023
- Emma!
- Well, if it isn't--

20:17.057 --> 20:19.158
me standing here,
talking to myself.

20:20.494 --> 20:22.262
Is she all right?

20:22.296 --> 20:24.531
She's got three boys
fawning over her.

20:26.100 --> 20:27.301
Works for most girls.

20:29.237 --> 20:31.138
Emma, I am so sorry.

20:31.172 --> 20:33.173
This will never happen again.

20:33.207 --> 20:34.374
Ben:
<i>Guys, it's all right.</i>

20:34.409 --> 20:37.244
We all make mistakes.

20:37.279 --> 20:39.079
But I think we could
definitely use some help.

20:40.449 --> 20:42.083
I need you, mom.

20:46.421 --> 20:48.255
Wait for it.

20:48.289 --> 20:49.753
I told you so.

20:49.873 --> 20:54.399
<font color="#ec14bd">Sync & corrections by honeybunny</font>
<font color="#ec14bd">www.addic7ed.com</font>

20:54.519 --> 20:56.543
Baby's at the ready...

20:57.518 --> 20:58.652
Oh, yeah.

20:58.687 --> 21:00.654
In three, two,

21:00.688 --> 21:01.622
one, roll!

21:01.656 --> 21:02.689
Come on, Emma, come here!

21:02.724 --> 21:04.491
- Roll!
- Come on, Emma. Roll to daddy.

21:04.525 --> 21:06.493
- Roll roll roll.
- Dan: This way, lead with your head.

21:06.527 --> 21:08.661
( All chattering )

21:09.696 --> 21:11.531
All: Oh!

21:11.565 --> 21:13.465
Are you kidding? Emma.

21:13.500 --> 21:14.565
Oh.

21:14.599 --> 21:16.664
- Double or nothing?
- You're on.

21:16.698 --> 21:19.298
- ( Laughing )
- Gentlemen, place your bets.
