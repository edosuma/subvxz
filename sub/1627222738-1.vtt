WEBVTT

01:27.826 --> 01:29.176
Hey, Lola.

01:29.219 --> 01:32.266
Checking in from Idaho.

01:32.309 --> 01:35.834
Other than my right foot being
one gigantic blister, I'’m okay.

01:35.878 --> 01:39.186
I'’ll just have to fight
through it.

01:39.229 --> 01:41.144
Fight it out, will it out.

01:41.188 --> 01:43.973
I'’ll call you again
from Twin Falls, okay?

01:44.016 --> 01:46.106
I miss you.
Hug Joseph for me.

02:02.296 --> 02:03.819
What the fuck?

02:03.862 --> 02:05.864
Fucking... You motherfucker!

02:05.908 --> 02:07.127
Hey, you all right?

02:07.170 --> 02:08.780
Yeah, I'’m all right.

02:08.824 --> 02:10.931
See, that'’s why you need
to do what Mom tells you to do.

02:10.955 --> 02:12.828
Walk against the traffic. What?

02:12.871 --> 02:14.699
You'’re 15, all right?
I'’m 45.

02:14.743 --> 02:16.503
You think I don'’t know
what I'’m doing out here?

02:16.527 --> 02:19.139
No I don'’t.
That'’s why I'm with you.

02:27.103 --> 02:30.324
We... we have with us
tonight Joe Bell,

02:30.367 --> 02:32.326
all the way
from La Grande, Oregon.

02:32.369 --> 02:35.111
Joe'’s here to talk to us tonight
about tolerance.

02:35.155 --> 02:36.755
Let'’s, uh,
give him a round of applause.

02:42.466 --> 02:43.641
Uh...

02:45.121 --> 02:46.664
Good afternoon.
Thanks for having me here.

02:46.688 --> 02:49.343
Uh...

02:49.386 --> 02:51.214
I jotted down a couple of things

02:51.258 --> 02:54.043
I want to chat
with you guys about, um...

02:54.086 --> 02:56.524
You know, a lot of people
don'’t think it's a big deal

02:56.567 --> 02:59.266
to make fun of other people...

03:00.615 --> 03:03.574
um, who are different from you.

03:03.618 --> 03:06.316
You know, bullying
and intolerance

03:06.360 --> 03:08.405
can have a deadly effect.

03:08.449 --> 03:10.799
And I'’m here because
I'’m walking across America

03:10.842 --> 03:12.366
on behalf of my son, Jadin,

03:12.409 --> 03:14.846
to speak out against bullying.

03:14.890 --> 03:17.545
All right?
Now it'’s important...

03:17.588 --> 03:20.112
Is it okay if I take this?

03:20.156 --> 03:23.246
I don'’t want to break it.

03:23.290 --> 03:26.467
You know, it'’s important
for people to understand,

03:26.510 --> 03:31.602
or understand how hurtful it
is to harass and torment people

03:31.646 --> 03:35.519
who aren'’t the same as you.

03:35.563 --> 03:38.130
And that understanding begins
at home

03:38.174 --> 03:40.045
with the parents and families.

03:40.089 --> 03:41.743
All right?

03:41.786 --> 03:43.808
Parents out there, just let
your kids be who they are,

03:43.832 --> 03:45.486
and it'’ll all be fine.

03:45.529 --> 03:47.551
You tell them you love them
no matter what, all right?

03:47.575 --> 03:48.987
Because that'’s what they need
to know.

03:49.011 --> 03:50.273
All right?

03:50.317 --> 03:52.101
Anybody have any questions
for me?

03:55.583 --> 03:57.193
No?

03:59.239 --> 04:01.850
Okay, well please
follow me on Facebook

04:01.893 --> 04:04.505
and share my message
with your friends.

04:04.548 --> 04:06.681
Thank you, guys.

04:08.596 --> 04:09.771
Thank you.

04:19.346 --> 04:20.911
Shit. Hey!

04:20.956 --> 04:23.219
Yeah? Why won'’t this thing work?

04:23.263 --> 04:25.569
Come on.

04:25.613 --> 04:26.918
You need any help?

04:26.962 --> 04:28.746
I'’m done now.

04:28.790 --> 04:30.357
I'’m useless. Get in, get in, get in.

04:32.533 --> 04:34.361
I'’m laying here with you?

04:34.404 --> 04:37.146
Yeah. You'’re stuck with me.

04:37.189 --> 04:38.539
Get your feet off my pillow!

04:38.582 --> 04:40.802
Oh, shit! Whoa!

05:06.480 --> 05:08.656
What was that last night, huh?

05:08.699 --> 05:11.180
"Understanding begins at home"?

05:12.486 --> 05:14.923
Whose home? Not ours.

05:14.966 --> 05:16.316
That'’s the way it was.

05:16.359 --> 05:18.753
No, not for me it wasn'’t.

05:18.796 --> 05:21.930
"Just be who you are
and it'’ll all be fine."

05:21.973 --> 05:24.585
How can you say that
when you know it'’s a lie?

05:24.628 --> 05:26.978
Look at that resolution
on this bad boy.

05:27.022 --> 05:28.763
I see it. Huh?

05:28.806 --> 05:30.852
Big TV.Oh, yeah.

05:30.895 --> 05:32.157
Hey, don'’t worry,

05:32.201 --> 05:34.072
the washing machine'’s
coming next.

05:34.116 --> 05:36.074
Yeah, I'’m not gonna
hold my breath on that!

05:36.118 --> 05:38.903
Hey, I'’m getting one of
these. Don'’t hook up the VHS.

05:38.947 --> 05:40.427
We ain'’t gonna use that shit.

05:40.470 --> 05:42.013
Well, there'’s plenty of holes
back there.

05:42.037 --> 05:43.604
Hey. LOLA: What?

05:43.647 --> 05:44.909
Get out of the way, man.

05:44.953 --> 05:47.564
All right, what can I get
anybody?

05:47.608 --> 05:49.044
Hey, come on. Hey. What?

05:49.087 --> 05:50.872
Sit with me for a few minutes
and enjoy this.

05:50.915 --> 05:54.005
No, game time'’s in an hour.
The food can wait, come on.

05:54.049 --> 05:56.878
Hey, Dad, can I talk to you
for a minute?

05:56.921 --> 05:59.446
What? LOLA: He needs to talk to you.

05:59.489 --> 06:01.883
Honey, I'’m talking to you.
Can I please talk to you just...?

06:01.926 --> 06:03.798
Now? Yes, now.

06:03.841 --> 06:06.627
You'’ve got to be shitting me.
All right, then, talk to me.

06:10.457 --> 06:13.373
Can we please talk outside
or out back?

06:13.416 --> 06:16.550
You gotta be shitting me.
Hey, don'’t touch the remote.

06:16.593 --> 06:17.768
All right.

06:20.205 --> 06:21.381
Well?

06:22.730 --> 06:24.558
Well? Can you just give me a second.

06:24.601 --> 06:26.187
That goddamn TV ain'’t gonna
watch itself.

06:26.211 --> 06:27.778
Well, Mom already knows.

06:27.822 --> 06:31.086
Knows what? What?

06:31.129 --> 06:33.610
Knows that I'’m getting picked
on by these guys at school.

06:35.177 --> 06:36.352
Why is that?

06:39.921 --> 06:41.836
I don'’t know,
because I'’m not like them?

06:41.879 --> 06:43.901
It'’s gotta be more than that.
That doesn'’t make sense.

06:43.925 --> 06:45.598
Why aren'’t you like
them? Because I'’m just...

06:45.622 --> 06:47.755
I'’m different. I'm just... Because why?

06:47.798 --> 06:50.322
Because I'’m not like them.
That'’s not an answer, Jadin.

06:50.366 --> 06:52.150
Doesn'’t make any sense. Because I'’m gay.

07:07.818 --> 07:09.777
You remember when I took
you boys to the Y?

07:09.820 --> 07:11.474
Hmm? I put boxing gloves on you both

07:11.518 --> 07:13.041
and made you duke it out.

07:13.084 --> 07:14.956
You need to know how to clean
anybody'’s clock.

07:14.999 --> 07:17.698
Anybody that messes with you.
Didn'’t I teach you anything?

07:24.879 --> 07:26.620
I don'’t want to spend
my high school

07:26.663 --> 07:28.685
duking it out with guys
who just don'’t agree with me.

07:28.709 --> 07:30.362
I can fight someone one on one,

07:30.406 --> 07:32.147
but I can'’t fight
an entire school.

07:32.190 --> 07:34.323
Well, if I got to go down there
and kick the fuck

07:34.366 --> 07:36.046
out of them little
sons of bitches, I will!

07:39.459 --> 07:41.983
You know what? We'’re gonna let
nature take its course.

07:42.026 --> 07:43.724
All right?

07:43.767 --> 07:46.553
This isn'’t anybody else's
business anyway, is it?

07:46.596 --> 07:48.555
Don'’t talk about it
with the other kids.

07:48.598 --> 07:50.620
Or with other people.
You mind your own damn business.

07:50.644 --> 07:52.186
It'’ll all be fine.
It'’ll work itself out.

07:52.210 --> 07:53.603
Joe.

07:53.647 --> 07:55.300
What? It'’s not gonna work itself out.

07:55.344 --> 07:57.346
What am I supposed to
do? Not talking about it

07:57.389 --> 07:59.217
is not gonna help.
JOE: It'’s gonna be fine.

07:59.261 --> 08:01.655
None of this is his fault.
JOE: I didn'’t say that it was.

08:01.698 --> 08:05.702
The only thing he needs to know
is that his family loves him.

08:05.746 --> 08:08.009
This family loves you. You'’re
stating the obvious here.

08:08.052 --> 08:10.292
- It'’s not that obvious.
- You can say it too, you know.

08:11.882 --> 08:13.318
He knows I love him.

08:14.537 --> 08:16.626
I love you. You...

08:16.670 --> 08:18.585
You know that.

08:21.718 --> 08:22.893
Are we done here now?

08:38.735 --> 08:39.953
Here you go.

08:39.996 --> 08:41.869
You fucking with my settings?

08:41.912 --> 08:45.350
I was just trying to see
if I could figure it out.

08:45.394 --> 08:47.222
Lola!

08:48.876 --> 08:50.530
I'’m getting a beer.

09:01.758 --> 09:05.675
Hey, just don'’t get all
bent out of shape about it, Joe.

09:05.719 --> 09:06.937
He'’s just a kid.

09:06.981 --> 09:08.417
What'’s that supposed to mean?

09:08.460 --> 09:10.898
I mean, so he'’s playing
a little grab-ass,

09:10.941 --> 09:13.422
stirring up some trouble.
It'’s not a big deal.

09:13.465 --> 09:15.139
What are you trying to say,
this is a phase?

09:15.163 --> 09:17.184
The point is, I know
what he'’s in for now, all right?

09:17.208 --> 09:19.404
I just don'’t want him out there
damn near broadcasting it.

09:19.428 --> 09:21.952
You know where we live. JIMMY: I know.

09:21.996 --> 09:24.999
I'’m just saying, kids are
designed to drive you nuts.

09:25.042 --> 09:27.567
He might just grow out of it.

09:30.308 --> 09:33.050
Go, Cougars!

09:33.094 --> 09:35.487
Let'’s go, Cougars!

09:36.576 --> 09:39.622
Let'’s go, Cougars!

09:39.666 --> 09:42.582
What in the hell?
Hey, Lola, come here.

09:43.713 --> 09:45.367
What? Come here!

09:45.410 --> 09:47.325
I'’m coming. What is it?

09:47.369 --> 09:48.718
You tell me.
What is this?

09:48.762 --> 09:51.329
What? He'’s practicing
his cheers.

09:51.373 --> 09:53.656
He'’s just going to do his cheers
out there in the front yard?

09:53.680 --> 09:55.290
We told him he could
join the squad...

09:55.333 --> 09:56.857
But in the front yard?

09:56.900 --> 09:59.555
Let him be, Joe.
It'’s his first game this week.

09:59.599 --> 10:01.557
Why not? Hell no, hell no. No, no, no.

10:01.601 --> 10:02.776
Joe... Joe.

10:02.819 --> 10:04.212
Mm-hmm. LOLA: Joe.

10:04.255 --> 10:07.345
Front yard. Oh, for God'’s sakes.

10:07.389 --> 10:08.845
Let'’s go, Cougars, let's go! Hey, son?

10:08.869 --> 10:10.174
Yeah? Could you...?

10:10.218 --> 10:11.761
Would you mind practicing
in the backyard?

10:11.785 --> 10:13.023
It'’s hard for me
to hear the TV.

10:13.047 --> 10:14.222
What?

10:16.354 --> 10:17.636
You'’re out in front here
yelling.

10:17.660 --> 10:19.401
And I can'’t hear
the television.

10:19.444 --> 10:22.186
Can you not just turn it
up? Don'’t tell me what to do.

10:22.230 --> 10:24.319
Your mother and I been
supporting this cheerleading,

10:24.362 --> 10:25.862
but you need to practice
in the backyard.

10:25.886 --> 10:27.278
What'’s his problem?

10:27.322 --> 10:28.821
Why can'’t we just
practice in the front?

10:28.845 --> 10:30.368
Get your ass
in the backyard now.

10:30.412 --> 10:31.737
Can'’t you ever
just shut the fuck up

10:31.761 --> 10:33.154
and do what you'’re told?

10:33.197 --> 10:34.677
I thought my home life
was unstable.

10:36.026 --> 10:37.985
Go ahead. Follow Marcie.

10:43.425 --> 10:45.514
You better tell Marcie to stop
running her mouth,

10:45.557 --> 10:47.734
or I'’m gonna put a foot
in her ass.

10:47.777 --> 10:49.474
Oh, okay.

10:53.783 --> 10:56.481
Come here. Come sit with me.

10:56.525 --> 10:57.657
I'’m doing my crossword.

11:50.971 --> 11:52.494
I'’m going to try to be better.

11:57.847 --> 11:59.022
I love you.

12:01.721 --> 12:02.852
I love you too.

12:04.158 --> 12:05.333
I know.

12:14.342 --> 12:16.799
- I got to give you credit, Dad.
- At least you'’re persistent.

12:16.823 --> 12:18.825
Well, I'’m walking all this way

12:18.868 --> 12:21.194
because that'’s where you told us
you wanted to live, remember?

12:21.218 --> 12:23.090
Oh, yeah. New York City.

12:23.133 --> 12:25.222
Yeah, your big dream.

12:25.266 --> 12:28.051
Mm-hmm. I mean,
obviously.

12:28.095 --> 12:30.445
Why obviously?

12:30.488 --> 12:33.056
Why not? Think about it,
if you were me,

12:33.100 --> 12:37.713
would you rather live
in La Grande or New York City?

12:37.757 --> 12:40.281
Well, I bet you'’ll feel more
comfortable in New York.

12:40.324 --> 12:42.085
Yeah. I'’m sure you're right.
That'’s the point.

12:42.109 --> 12:43.521
All right, well,
just for the record,

12:43.545 --> 12:44.938
I happen to love La Grande.

12:44.981 --> 12:46.350
So, you know,
why don'’t you just...?

12:46.374 --> 12:48.768
Okay, no, uh-uh.
There'’s no comparison.

12:48.811 --> 12:50.813
There'’s no comparison. Well, I...

12:50.857 --> 12:53.729
Okay, what does La Grande have?

12:53.773 --> 12:56.210
Nothing. Exactly.
What does New York have?

12:56.253 --> 12:58.865
It has every kind of food,

12:58.908 --> 13:01.737
every kind of people,
every kind of pizza.

13:01.781 --> 13:03.347
We got pizza in La Grande.

13:03.391 --> 13:06.829
It'’s got skyscrapers
and Broadway and... Stefani.

13:06.873 --> 13:08.178
I mean, hello?
Stefani.

13:08.222 --> 13:09.789
Who'’s Stefani?

13:09.832 --> 13:11.921
Stefani Joanne Angelina
Germanotta.

13:11.965 --> 13:15.185
What? Who is that?

13:15.229 --> 13:17.797
Gaga, Dad.Oh.

13:17.840 --> 13:19.276
Lady Gaga.

13:19.320 --> 13:21.670
Yeah, yeah. And, you know, of course...

13:21.713 --> 13:23.256
Of course she'’s proud
of how she grew up.

13:23.280 --> 13:25.717
I mean, she grew up in New York.

13:25.761 --> 13:27.850
Only a New Yorker
could write that song.

13:27.894 --> 13:29.156
Well, don'’t start.

13:29.199 --> 13:30.548
Oh, come on.

Hey, my name'’s Joe Bell.

15:44.117 --> 15:46.162
Overheard you talking over here.

15:46.206 --> 15:48.991
I'’m on a walk for change
for my son Jadin.

15:49.035 --> 15:50.340
And, uh...

15:50.384 --> 15:51.602
I'’d like you to check out

15:51.646 --> 15:53.126
our message of inclusion.

Appreciate it if you get
a chance, thanks.

I don'’t know what the fuck
that'’s all about.

16:06.922 --> 16:09.838
Dad. Don'’t start your shit, Jadin.

16:11.883 --> 16:13.755
Dad! What?

16:13.798 --> 16:16.410
Giving them a card and running
away isn'’t gonna change shit.

16:16.453 --> 16:18.455
I'’m sorry, but it'’s not.

16:18.499 --> 16:20.042
I don'’t know if you
realize this or not,

16:20.066 --> 16:21.241
but this is America, okay?

16:21.284 --> 16:22.590
And they'’re Americans.

16:22.633 --> 16:24.331
They are entitled
to their own opinion.

16:24.374 --> 16:25.854
Okay, I'’m starving
my ass off, okay?

16:25.897 --> 16:27.377
I just wanted to finish my meal

16:27.421 --> 16:29.597
and get back on the road
and on my walk.

16:29.640 --> 16:31.164
Which I am doing for you,
remember?

16:31.207 --> 16:33.079
I mean, what else the hell...

16:33.122 --> 16:35.405
What else in the hell do you
expect from me, for chrissakes?

16:35.429 --> 16:37.605
The people that come
to your talks aren'’t the issue.

16:37.648 --> 16:39.128
They are.

16:39.172 --> 16:40.825
Really?

16:40.869 --> 16:43.002
Guys like that and their kids.
That'’s the issue.

16:43.045 --> 16:44.829
I hate to break it to you,

16:44.873 --> 16:47.310
but we wouldn'’t be hauling
our asses cross-country on foot

16:47.354 --> 16:50.009
if you'’d actually done what I
told you to in the first place.

16:50.052 --> 16:52.707
You told me to fight,
which you didn'’t do.

16:52.750 --> 16:54.361
And? You'’re a hypocrite.

16:54.404 --> 16:56.252
I'’m the hypocrite? Don'’t
want to be a hypocrite,

16:56.276 --> 16:58.017
then go back in there
and kick their asses.

16:58.060 --> 17:00.193
Oh, I'’m sorry, give them
another card and say bye.

17:33.530 --> 17:35.489
Yes, I agree.

17:35.532 --> 17:36.881
Very, very.

17:36.925 --> 17:38.448
Oh, who are we talking about?

17:55.552 --> 17:57.598
They'’re so loud.

17:57.641 --> 18:00.296
Oh, my gosh, he'’s so hot.

18:03.169 --> 18:04.692
Guys, guys, guys.

18:05.780 --> 18:06.955
Yeah.

18:20.316 --> 18:21.839
You guys want to come over?

18:21.883 --> 18:23.145
Jerk!

18:23.189 --> 18:24.755
First down, faggot!

18:24.799 --> 18:27.584
You guys are such assholes.

18:27.628 --> 18:28.977
Takes one to know one.

18:45.385 --> 18:46.864
Chug, chug!

19:01.096 --> 19:02.489
Get a drink.

19:03.968 --> 19:05.492
I do. Really?

19:27.035 --> 19:28.689
She has had so many drinks.

19:40.788 --> 19:42.311
Wanna smoke?

19:50.276 --> 19:52.234
Go, go. Right now?

19:52.278 --> 19:54.193
Yes, go. Hurry.Okay.

20:21.307 --> 20:22.525
I didn'’t know you smoked.

20:22.569 --> 20:25.093
Yeah, we'’re not supposed to.

20:27.226 --> 20:28.792
Don'’t tell coach, okay?

20:28.836 --> 20:31.012
Don'’t worry,
your secret'’s safe with me.

20:39.716 --> 20:40.891
Is it?

20:45.287 --> 20:46.419
Yeah.

21:09.877 --> 21:11.531
You jerk, where are you
taking me?

21:21.889 --> 21:23.412
You kissed a football player?

21:23.456 --> 21:25.588
Mm-hmm.

21:25.632 --> 21:29.026
Uh, no, technically
he'’s a running back.

21:29.070 --> 21:30.593
What'’s that?

21:30.637 --> 21:33.770
I don'’t know, actually.

21:33.814 --> 21:36.338
This is, like, the stuff
dreams are made of.

21:36.382 --> 21:37.600
I know.

21:37.644 --> 21:39.080
How was the kiss?

21:39.123 --> 21:40.563
Can we not talk
about this right now?

21:40.603 --> 21:42.320
You wanna go to my room
and talk about this?

21:42.344 --> 21:44.540
Yeah, I want to talk about this.
I want to talk about this.

21:44.564 --> 21:47.044
Warmer? Okay, come on.

21:47.088 --> 21:51.135
Second and ten
on the 45-yard line.

21:54.400 --> 21:56.706
Here we go, Cougars.
Here we go.

22:00.275 --> 22:02.625
Let'’s go, Cougars!

22:05.585 --> 22:07.369
Let'’s go...

22:07.413 --> 22:09.197
Do a good job, Chance. Let'’s go.

22:09.240 --> 22:11.547
Come on, Chance! Go, number 5!

22:11.591 --> 22:13.462
Whoo!

22:16.160 --> 22:17.727
Whoo!

22:17.771 --> 22:20.121
Yeah! Whoo!

22:24.604 --> 22:27.694
Hey, Bell,
did you forget your skirt?

22:29.435 --> 22:30.871
Whoo!

22:35.005 --> 22:36.355
Hey, ass bandit!

22:40.576 --> 22:41.838
Is that a boy down there?

22:41.882 --> 22:45.059
What the hell
is the school thinking?

22:45.102 --> 22:46.277
Hike!

23:00.248 --> 23:01.728
Touchdown, Cougars!

23:15.306 --> 23:17.396
A 30-yard pass to number 40...

23:17.439 --> 23:20.050
Let'’s go, Cougars!

23:20.094 --> 23:22.401
Let'’s go, Cougars!

23:23.532 --> 23:26.143
Let'’s go, Cougars! Whoo!

24:04.138 --> 24:06.096
I saw what they said about you.

24:08.447 --> 24:10.274
Doesn'’t it bother you
what people say?

24:13.887 --> 24:15.192
Words can'’t hurt me.

24:17.064 --> 24:20.328
I'’m tougher than I look, okay?

24:40.304 --> 24:41.697
Look at these mountains.

24:41.741 --> 24:42.959
They'’re so steep.

24:43.003 --> 24:44.308
Yeah.

24:44.352 --> 24:47.007
If we had more time,
we'’d hike them.

24:47.050 --> 24:48.574
You can see why
I always wanted you

24:48.617 --> 24:50.401
to go hunting and fishing
with me.

24:50.445 --> 24:52.858
Take you up there and get you
away from everything down below.

24:52.882 --> 24:54.536
Yeah, real macho stuff.

24:54.580 --> 24:56.451
I was just trying to be
a decent parent.

24:56.495 --> 24:57.950
I mean, I thought
being out in the wild

24:57.974 --> 24:59.149
would help you be a man.

25:01.021 --> 25:03.216
What does that mean to you,
"be a man"? I'’m just curious.

25:03.240 --> 25:05.373
I did the same thing for Joseph
for the same reason,

25:05.416 --> 25:06.896
and he'’s not gay.

25:06.940 --> 25:09.420
It didn'’t matter to you
what I was okay with,

25:09.464 --> 25:11.640
especially after you started
your cheerleading thing.

25:11.684 --> 25:14.034
I mean, Dad, some men
like cheerleading

25:14.077 --> 25:15.514
and some men like hiking.

25:15.557 --> 25:16.993
And I think if we'’re...

25:17.037 --> 25:18.821
I don'’t know,
if we'’re being honest,

25:18.865 --> 25:21.563
you were never really okay
with me cheerleading, were you?

25:21.607 --> 25:22.825
No, if we'’re being honest,

25:22.869 --> 25:24.229
if you thought
you could handle it,

25:24.261 --> 25:25.436
I knew different.

25:27.613 --> 25:31.181
I mean, you saw me cheer,
like, once?

25:31.225 --> 25:34.402
The one time you did, you left. What?

25:34.445 --> 25:36.467
People were calling me names
and throwing stuff at me,

25:36.491 --> 25:38.251
and you got up and
left. I was afraid for you.

25:38.275 --> 25:40.669
We were all afraid for you.

25:54.640 --> 25:58.034
Well, I worked two shifts today.

26:00.254 --> 26:04.563
And then I came home
to do some laundry,

26:04.606 --> 26:07.740
and the laundry machine
finally just fucking died.

26:09.263 --> 26:10.663
But with a whole load
of clothes in,

26:10.699 --> 26:12.483
it wouldn'’t drain.

26:12.527 --> 26:15.225
I mean, it was...
it was such a mess.

26:15.269 --> 26:16.705
Well, I'’m sorry about all that,

26:16.749 --> 26:18.968
but there'’s not much
I can do from out here.

26:22.363 --> 26:24.060
There'’s really not much
you could do

26:24.104 --> 26:26.585
if you were standing
right in front of me.

26:29.631 --> 26:30.763
I'’m right about that.

26:31.938 --> 26:34.549
You know you should just call us

26:34.593 --> 26:38.901
at the same time every week,
you know?

26:38.945 --> 26:42.775
Just set it so we know
that we'’re gonna hear from you.

26:42.818 --> 26:45.516
Look, Lola...

26:45.560 --> 26:47.518
I'’m afraid for Joseph
with you drinking again.

26:47.562 --> 26:50.478
I mean, I want to trust things
are okay while I'’m gone,

26:50.521 --> 26:52.611
but you'’re damn near
slurring every other word.

26:52.654 --> 26:54.917
Joseph doesn'’t need to see
that. LOLA: Wait, what? Wait.

26:54.961 --> 26:56.615
What is... What is...
What is so difficult

26:56.658 --> 26:57.877
about what I just asked?

26:57.920 --> 26:59.269
Well, I know
that you drink a lot,

26:59.313 --> 27:01.054
and so does Marcie and Joseph.

27:01.097 --> 27:02.708
Can'’t you just stop
with one damn drink?

27:02.751 --> 27:04.337
What, you gotta have
five or ten of them?

27:04.361 --> 27:07.190
Joe, you'’re not here.

27:07.234 --> 27:10.411
You have no idea
what'’s going on.

27:10.454 --> 27:12.152
No idea.

27:17.723 --> 27:19.638
So, what are you gonna do?
You gonna go to bed?

27:19.681 --> 27:21.398
Oh, no, I dipped into
our retirement savings

27:21.422 --> 27:22.965
so I could splurge
on a presidential suite

27:22.989 --> 27:24.164
at the Bear River Inn.

27:30.431 --> 27:32.389
Right.

27:32.433 --> 27:35.044
Well, love you.

27:35.088 --> 27:36.263
I love you.

27:47.143 --> 27:50.059
Hey. Hey.

27:50.103 --> 27:51.321
What? Come here.

27:51.365 --> 27:52.714
What? It'’s gold!

27:52.758 --> 27:54.498
Gold, baby!

27:54.542 --> 27:56.152
What? JOE: Whoo!

27:56.196 --> 27:59.242
Green gold, baby.
Look at these bad boys.

27:59.286 --> 28:01.418
Look at the size of them. Huh?

28:01.462 --> 28:03.246
Is that asparagus? Oh, man.

28:03.290 --> 28:05.616
I'’m gonna grill them up on
the fire, you are gonna love it.

28:05.640 --> 28:07.183
Ain'’t nothing better
than wild asparagus.

28:07.207 --> 28:09.035
Oh, that smells so good. BOTH: Oh, yeah.

28:09.078 --> 28:10.732
That'’s the real deal
right there, baby.

28:10.776 --> 28:13.430
Yeah, man. JOE: This is green gold. Whoo!

28:23.005 --> 28:24.485
Nothing better.

28:24.528 --> 28:26.313
Right out of the ground.
Taste that.

28:30.709 --> 28:32.362
That'’s so good.

28:32.406 --> 28:33.905
Give me more of that.
You'’re hogging it.

28:33.929 --> 28:35.322
I haven'’t had a bite yet.

28:35.365 --> 28:37.019
What the heck?

28:37.063 --> 28:38.804
Here, get one. Just make sure it'’s cooked.

28:38.847 --> 28:40.287
I don'’t want you eating
nothing raw.

28:44.113 --> 28:47.203
You know, this is the one thing
you can cook.

28:56.386 --> 28:58.475
Did you ever wish
that I wrestled?

28:58.519 --> 29:00.919
No. You didn'’t want to wrestle,
you didn'’t have to wrestle.

29:02.349 --> 29:04.351
Joseph'’s gotten really good.

29:04.394 --> 29:06.179
You know why'’s good at it? Why?

29:06.222 --> 29:07.746
Because he works hard at it.

29:07.789 --> 29:09.530
You put the time in...

29:10.879 --> 29:13.664
you get good at whatever
you work hard at.

29:13.708 --> 29:15.014
That'’s all about sacrifice.

29:19.148 --> 29:20.671
Trying to get
this one big one here.

29:32.553 --> 29:34.294
Whoo!

29:34.337 --> 29:35.904
Yeah, buddy!

29:40.953 --> 29:42.955
Let'’s go, Cougars, let'’s go!

29:42.998 --> 29:46.872
Let'’s go, Cougars, let's go!
Come on!

29:46.915 --> 29:49.439
Come on. Come out here.
It feels great.

29:49.483 --> 29:51.615
Let'’s go, Cougars, let's go!
Argh.

29:52.791 --> 29:54.227
I will keep you up all night.

29:54.270 --> 29:56.446
Let'’s go, Cougars!
Let'’s go!

29:56.490 --> 29:59.885
Let'’s go, grandpa.
Come on.

29:59.928 --> 30:02.191
Let'’s go, Cougars! Let's go!!
Argh!

30:02.235 --> 30:03.908
All right, show me again. All right, ready?

30:03.932 --> 30:05.586
Yeah.Watch.

30:05.629 --> 30:07.675
Let'’s go, Cougars, let's go!

30:07.718 --> 30:09.416
Argh! Argh!

30:17.772 --> 30:19.339
Whoo!

30:40.012 --> 30:42.275
How many yards did you
rush for in last night'’s game?

30:42.318 --> 30:43.537
Uh...

30:43.580 --> 30:45.321
158.

30:50.239 --> 30:52.851
Is that a lot, or...?

30:56.332 --> 30:59.074
If you don'’t know,
why are you asking?

30:59.118 --> 31:01.207
I want to know about your game.

31:02.991 --> 31:05.907
Um... yeah.

31:05.951 --> 31:08.301
Yeah, I mean,
158'’s pretty good.

31:08.344 --> 31:11.130
Um, it'’s below my average,
though, but...

31:12.914 --> 31:15.917
you know, I don'’t need
to be a star or anything.

31:15.961 --> 31:17.919
I just want to get
into a small program

31:17.963 --> 31:19.399
and play football somewhere.

31:23.185 --> 31:25.187
Like where?

31:25.231 --> 31:26.754
Um...

31:26.797 --> 31:28.930
well, I'’m not really, you know,

31:28.974 --> 31:30.845
D-1 material.

31:30.889 --> 31:33.065
But I don'’t know.

31:33.108 --> 31:35.371
Like Portland State, maybe?

31:35.415 --> 31:36.807
Maybe Eastern Washington.

31:40.550 --> 31:44.598
That'’s a long way away
from where I'’ll be.

31:44.641 --> 31:46.992
Hmm. And where'’s that?

31:47.035 --> 31:48.210
New York.

31:50.996 --> 31:52.876
You know there'’s a lot
of colleges in New York.

31:58.003 --> 31:59.526
And if you wanted to...

32:01.484 --> 32:02.659
I don'’t know, go east...

32:06.098 --> 32:08.056
we could go together.

32:08.100 --> 32:09.797
Or something.

32:16.499 --> 32:18.419
I don'’t know, Jadin.
That'’s aiming pretty high.

32:24.855 --> 32:26.161
He, uh...

32:27.249 --> 32:28.511
he got freaked out.

32:31.601 --> 32:33.168
He was afraid
that he'’d get kicked out

32:33.212 --> 32:35.388
if his moron parents knew.

32:40.741 --> 32:42.961
Romantic relationships
aren'’t everything, Jadin.

32:43.004 --> 32:45.267
They'’re not the solution
to life.

32:45.311 --> 32:47.835
It was the solution to my life.

32:47.878 --> 32:50.751
My life, Dad.
Not yours. Mine.

33:28.963 --> 33:30.138
Nervous, huh?

33:30.182 --> 33:32.967
No. Why would I be nervous?

33:33.011 --> 33:34.751
What if somebody hits on you?

33:34.795 --> 33:36.362
Nobody'’s gonna hit on me.

33:36.405 --> 33:38.973
It'’s a gay bar, Dad.

33:39.017 --> 33:40.864
Somebody'’s gonna hit on
you. How would you know?

33:40.888 --> 33:42.237
Ever been to a gay bar? No, but...

33:42.281 --> 33:43.847
Have you ever been to a bar? JADIN: No.

33:43.891 --> 33:45.066
Okay, then.

33:45.110 --> 33:46.546
Also, it'’s drag night,

33:46.589 --> 33:47.808
so you better dance.

33:47.851 --> 33:49.418
I don'’t dance.

33:49.462 --> 33:52.378
I cannot wait to see my dad,
the magnificent Joe Bell,

33:52.421 --> 33:54.423
working it with some
fierce lady queens.

33:54.467 --> 33:56.307
That'’s not gonna happen.
You'’re staying here.

33:56.338 --> 33:57.968
Okay, well, at least say hi
to Cher for me.

33:57.992 --> 33:59.733
Cher? Mm-hmm. There'’s always a Cher.

33:59.776 --> 34:01.213
It'’s a given. How would you know?

34:01.256 --> 34:03.345
Because. It'’s a given.

34:03.389 --> 34:05.347
And if she flirts with you,
try not to be mean.

34:05.391 --> 34:07.045
Why would I be mean?

34:07.088 --> 34:08.871
I mean, who the hell
do you think I am?

34:08.916 --> 34:10.222
Would you flirt back?

34:10.264 --> 34:11.875
No, I would not, Jadin. JADIN: Why not?

34:11.918 --> 34:14.094
Because. Because why?

34:14.139 --> 34:16.097
Because Cher'’s not my type.

34:16.141 --> 34:18.056
Now, if Dolly'’s there... JADIN: No.

34:18.099 --> 34:20.188
I'’m gonna motorboat
them big-ass titties.

34:22.103 --> 34:24.322
You are disgusting.

34:26.107 --> 34:28.630
Dad... What?

34:28.675 --> 34:31.156
Relax. You got this.

34:32.460 --> 34:34.376
You know that'’s my job.

34:34.420 --> 34:35.725
To reassure you.

34:37.597 --> 34:39.164
Yeah, I wish I could
go with you.

34:39.206 --> 34:40.730
Yeah, well, so do I.

34:44.342 --> 34:45.909
Well, wish me luck.

34:45.953 --> 34:47.694
Good luck. Give me a hug.

34:47.737 --> 34:48.911
All right.

34:56.224 --> 34:58.444
How do I look?

34:58.487 --> 35:00.098
Pants tight enough
but not too tight?

35:00.141 --> 35:02.230
Oh, God, Dad! I'’m
gonna keep the flaps down.

35:02.274 --> 35:04.319
Stop buying the time.
Get out of here.

35:04.363 --> 35:05.581
Go. Good luck.Bye.

35:05.625 --> 35:06.800
Bye.

35:33.261 --> 35:36.046
Our folks are deeply religious.

35:36.090 --> 35:39.267
I was 15, and I was a deacon
at our church.

35:39.311 --> 35:42.096
I was sitting at church
with my family,

35:42.140 --> 35:45.360
and the sermon that day
was on sins against God.

35:45.404 --> 35:49.495
And when he said,
"gays are going to hell,"

35:49.538 --> 35:52.193
I couldn'’t take it anymore.

35:52.237 --> 35:55.762
I got up and I-I-I
went to leave,

35:55.805 --> 35:58.001
and my mom stopped me and
she said, "Where are you going?"

35:58.025 --> 36:00.462
And I turned and I said
"To hell, apparently."

36:04.510 --> 36:06.425
It'’s seems funny now, but... It was funny.

36:08.296 --> 36:11.212
At the time it was like
an avalanche had hit.

36:11.256 --> 36:14.650
My entire life was hell.

36:17.000 --> 36:19.786
It'’s hard to stand strong

36:19.829 --> 36:23.224
in places where there are more
churches than there are gays.

36:23.268 --> 36:25.661
Churches, man.
Don'’t even get me started.

36:25.705 --> 36:27.881
Jadin went to church with
a friend of his one Sunday.

36:27.924 --> 36:29.554
I mean, he was hoping
he'’d make some friends

36:29.578 --> 36:31.319
and find a place where people
would be kind.

36:31.363 --> 36:33.582
During the service, the pastor
singled him out and said,

36:33.626 --> 36:35.976
"If you are gay, you must come
up here to the altar

36:36.019 --> 36:38.544
and repent your sins,
or leave."

36:38.587 --> 36:41.242
Jaden told us it made him feel
horrible, like he didn'’t belong.

36:41.286 --> 36:43.723
You got them Catholic Church
taking child molesting priests,

36:43.766 --> 36:45.638
they move them from one
church to another

36:45.681 --> 36:47.920
so they can molest other boys,
and they won'’t accept my son

36:47.944 --> 36:49.729
because he'’s openly gay?
I mean, the idea is

36:49.772 --> 36:53.036
you'’re supposed to worship
the guy who died to build it,

36:53.080 --> 36:54.908
not the frigging assholes
in there

36:54.951 --> 36:56.755
that are judging everybody
doing God knows what

36:56.779 --> 36:58.999
behind closed doors. WILL: It'’s true.

37:00.566 --> 37:02.568
People think it'’s easier
these days.

37:02.611 --> 37:05.266
But everyone in this bar knows
that'’s not necessarily true.

37:05.310 --> 37:07.355
That'’s why they come here.

37:07.399 --> 37:10.576
This place is like a church too.

37:10.619 --> 37:12.186
I think it'’s amazing.

37:12.230 --> 37:13.709
Hi, darlings.

37:13.753 --> 37:15.320
It'’s almost showtime again.

37:15.363 --> 37:17.713
Oh, my God, who is this?

37:17.757 --> 37:19.976
Don'’t make me introduce myself.

37:20.020 --> 37:22.109
This is Joe Bell.

37:22.152 --> 37:25.068
Where have you been all my life?

37:26.505 --> 37:27.810
He'’s just visiting. Oh, perfect.

37:27.854 --> 37:29.725
Well, if you need
a place to crash,

37:29.769 --> 37:31.379
there'’s room on my couch.

37:31.423 --> 37:33.860
Or my bed.

37:33.903 --> 37:36.254
Oh, I'’m, uh...

37:36.297 --> 37:37.907
I'’m... I'm... Well...

37:37.951 --> 37:41.433
I'’m not... I mean,
I am a straight guy.

37:41.476 --> 37:43.130
I didn'’t know if you were
serious or not.

37:43.173 --> 37:45.263
Joe'’s walking across the country
to raise awareness

37:45.306 --> 37:48.527
about bullying,
because his son was bullied.

37:48.570 --> 37:50.311
Well, why didn'’t you bring him?

37:50.355 --> 37:53.096
Especially if he'’s as cute
as you are.

37:53.140 --> 37:55.708
Is he as cute as you, Daddy?

37:58.363 --> 38:01.104
Um... my son is dead.

38:05.195 --> 38:06.371
Oh, my God.

38:06.414 --> 38:08.503
Oh, my God, I had no idea.

38:08.547 --> 38:10.636
I'’m... I'm so sorry. JOE:
It'’s all good. Really.

38:10.679 --> 38:12.681
Let me take my foot
out of my mouth.

38:12.725 --> 38:14.050
I'’m so sorry, I... No, no, no, I...

38:14.074 --> 38:15.684
I had no idea. It'’s all good.

38:15.728 --> 38:17.599
No, it'’s... It's not.

38:17.643 --> 38:20.950
I really didn'’t know, and now
I'’ve got to perform again.

38:20.994 --> 38:22.909
Hey, hey. I'’m okay. I'’m so sorry.

40:57.411 --> 40:59.500
It'’s been a hell of a walk
through Colorado.

40:59.544 --> 41:02.721
You gotta call us, you know,

That storm went way south of me.

41:09.336 --> 41:10.816
I only caught
the tail end of it.

41:10.859 --> 41:14.123
Yeah, well, still just call us.

Coach filmed a few of them.
Well, I can'’t wait to see them.

41:30.531 --> 41:32.751
Yeah, hey, Dad,

41:32.794 --> 41:36.450
what would you think about me
and Mom coming to visit you?

41:36.494 --> 41:38.626
Out on the road.
I mean, not on the road,

41:38.670 --> 41:42.717
but maybe in a motel
or a hotel, even?

41:42.761 --> 41:45.546
Well, I can'’t think of anything
I'’d like better.

41:45.590 --> 41:47.548
Your mom okay with it?

41:47.592 --> 41:49.768
Mom? Yeah.
She'’s okay with it.

41:49.811 --> 41:51.073

we'’ll talk about it.

42:04.783 --> 42:07.699
All right. Hurry.

42:07.742 --> 42:09.309
All right. Love you, bye.

42:15.794 --> 42:17.709
Oh, shit.

42:22.191 --> 42:23.802
Well, it'’s starting to snow.

42:23.845 --> 42:25.760

snowboarding later.

it'’s only been a few months.

42:36.989 --> 42:38.556
You'’re as tall as me
Missed you, buddy.

42:38.599 --> 42:40.296
I missed you too, Dad.Hey.

42:40.340 --> 42:42.516
Hi. Saw you spit

42:42.560 --> 42:44.387
Oh, no,
that'’s just for walking.

Mm-hmm. You smell so good.

42:50.132 --> 42:52.572
I brought my wrestling tapes.Good.
We'’ll watch them tonight.

I'’m telling you,
I think you can beat the record.

44:12.214 --> 44:13.694
Excuse me.

44:13.738 --> 44:15.565
Excuse me, aren'’t...?

44:15.609 --> 44:17.543
Aren'’t you that fella
that'’s walking across America?

44:17.567 --> 44:18.743
I am.

44:18.786 --> 44:20.179
Sir, it is a pleasure
to meet you.

44:20.222 --> 44:22.094
Dad'’s a celebrity. MAN: This is my wife.

44:22.137 --> 44:24.836
So nice to meet you.

44:24.879 --> 44:27.447
Hi, I'’m... I'm his wife.

44:27.490 --> 44:29.033
And Jadin'’s mom. WOMAN: Nice to meet you.

44:29.057 --> 44:31.451
And this is our son,
Joseph. Hi, I'’m Joseph.

44:31.494 --> 44:33.801
Hi, Joseph. MAN: I think it'’s incredible

44:33.845 --> 44:36.412
what you'’re doing for
your son. WOMAN: Yes.

44:36.456 --> 44:38.719
Takes real courage to stick up
for what you believe in.

44:38.763 --> 44:40.895
Well, it'’s got to be done.
This can'’t go on.

44:40.939 --> 44:42.680
Yes. MAN: Would you mind

44:42.723 --> 44:44.638
if we got our picture with you?

44:44.682 --> 44:47.772
Sure. Absolutely. WOMAN: Yes. Thank you.

44:47.815 --> 44:49.338
Honey, take the picture.

44:49.382 --> 44:51.340
Oh. Okay.

44:51.384 --> 44:52.733
Thank you. WOMAN: Thank you.

44:56.911 --> 44:59.087
That'’s real good work.
JOSEPH: I'’m getting faster.

44:59.131 --> 45:00.828
You see how much leverage
you got on him?

45:00.872 --> 45:02.090
He ain'’t going nowhere.

45:02.134 --> 45:04.049
That'’s good.

45:04.092 --> 45:05.659
That'’s real good.

45:08.096 --> 45:11.099
You seen this? Yeah.

45:11.143 --> 45:12.492
I was there when it happened.

45:12.535 --> 45:13.991
He'’s got some pretty decent
takedowns,

45:14.015 --> 45:15.689
but these transitions
are a lot more fluid.

45:15.713 --> 45:16.931
What'’s coach saying?

45:16.975 --> 45:18.585
Coach is saying I'’m doing good.

45:18.628 --> 45:20.389
You know, he'’s... Well,
I'’m seeing right here.

45:20.413 --> 45:23.024
We'’ve been working out,
but he says I might want

45:23.068 --> 45:24.809
to look into losing
a few pounds.

45:24.852 --> 45:27.725
What? This boy'’s just growing.
No, no, no, no, no.

45:27.768 --> 45:30.466
You go up a couple pounds.
Go up another weight class.

45:30.510 --> 45:32.425
Brush your teeth. Tell
the coach what I said.

45:32.468 --> 45:33.837
All right. Make sure you tell coach.

45:33.861 --> 45:35.360
We got an early morning
tomorrow, okay?

45:35.384 --> 45:36.821
Okay. Hey, hey, hey, hey.

45:36.864 --> 45:38.779
"Hey, hey, hey."

45:38.823 --> 45:41.434
Get him to bed
so I can get you to bed.

45:41.477 --> 45:43.175
I'’m trying.
You wanna help me?

45:43.218 --> 45:45.046
I'’m just...

45:45.090 --> 45:46.918
I can'’t believe how much
he'’s improved.

45:46.961 --> 45:48.136
I know. Isn'’t it great?

45:52.010 --> 45:53.315
I found this.

45:53.359 --> 45:55.187
I thought you might like
to see it.

45:55.230 --> 45:56.536
What'’s that?

45:56.579 --> 45:58.233
Uh, well...

45:58.277 --> 45:59.452
Let me see.

46:13.379 --> 46:14.597
Where'’d this come from?

46:14.641 --> 46:17.035
It was on his grave,
in some flowers.

46:17.078 --> 46:18.863
One of them little shits
that bullied my boy

46:18.906 --> 46:21.082
into the ground had the nerve
to stand over his grave?

46:21.126 --> 46:23.128
Well, Joe... Why?

46:23.171 --> 46:25.217
And now he wants to apologize?

46:25.260 --> 46:27.001
Who'’s this for?

46:27.045 --> 46:28.936
It'’s not for Jadin,
because he'’s dead and buried.

46:28.960 --> 46:30.178
And not for me.

46:30.222 --> 46:31.832
What am I supposed to do
with this, Lola?

46:31.876 --> 46:33.810
I don'’t know I thought
you'’d like to see it, Joe.

46:33.834 --> 46:36.073
I shouldn'’t have brought it.
No, don'’t keep secrets from me.

46:36.097 --> 46:37.988
Don'’t even threaten that.
I'’m not keeping secrets.

46:38.012 --> 46:39.903
I'’m out here on my own,
no money, alone, all right?

46:39.927 --> 46:42.538
No, the truth is all I have.
Shit!

46:42.582 --> 46:44.584
Well... That little son of a bitch.

46:44.627 --> 46:48.370
you'’re...you're on a walk
for forgiveness, right?

46:48.414 --> 46:49.850
For...

46:49.894 --> 46:51.896
There'’s no apologies
with me, okay?

46:51.939 --> 46:54.594
There is no forgiveness here.
They buried that with my boy.

46:54.637 --> 46:56.552
Do you understand that, Lola?

46:58.293 --> 46:59.749
I should not have
brought that letter.

46:59.773 --> 47:01.731
Lola... what?

47:01.775 --> 47:04.169
It'’s all yours, Dad. JOE:
Those sons of bitches.

47:04.212 --> 47:06.016
Fucking kidding me.
LOLA: Don'’t worry about it.

47:06.040 --> 47:07.825
Don'’t think about it then, Joe.

47:09.522 --> 47:13.091
Son of a bitch, Joseph,
get your ass in here now!

47:13.134 --> 47:15.484
Did you hear what the fuck
I said? Now!

47:15.528 --> 47:17.573
You see what you'’ve done? Look!

47:17.617 --> 47:19.314
How many times
have I told you, huh?

47:19.358 --> 47:21.379
How many times to put the seat
up when you take a piss?

47:21.403 --> 47:23.188
Joe! A hundred? A thousand?

47:23.231 --> 47:25.166
Nobody'’s fucking talking to you.
Shut the fuck up.

47:25.190 --> 47:26.626
What do you think,
I'’m your maid?

47:26.669 --> 47:27.932
Hey! Just stop!

47:40.901 --> 47:42.729
Jesus Christ.

48:07.972 --> 48:09.538
Hey.

48:09.582 --> 48:12.585
What I saw in those practice
films was damn good, son.

48:12.628 --> 48:15.631
You keep it up, you'’ll be state
champ by the time I get back.

48:18.199 --> 48:19.374
I love you.

48:21.768 --> 48:22.900
Did you hear me?

48:28.122 --> 48:31.343
Yeah. Take care, Dad.

48:32.605 --> 48:33.780
And what else?

48:37.001 --> 48:38.437
I love you too.

48:43.355 --> 48:44.965
Hey.Hey.

48:45.009 --> 48:47.009
So I'’ll see you in Illinois,
or maybe even before.

48:48.577 --> 48:49.752
Yeah. We'’ll see.

48:51.406 --> 48:53.495
Well, I thought that was
the plan, Lola.

48:55.410 --> 48:56.810
We talked about this.
Lola, don'’t...

48:56.846 --> 48:59.240
Joe, don'’t you. Don't.

49:02.765 --> 49:04.376
What are you doing out here?

49:04.419 --> 49:06.726
Because we'’ve supported you
every step of the way,

49:06.769 --> 49:08.989
because we know
what'’s right for you.

49:09.033 --> 49:11.861
But you'’re supposed to be
on some forgiveness walk?

49:11.905 --> 49:14.473
And you act the way
you acted last night.

49:18.825 --> 49:22.568
Our son is gone, Joe.
Gone.

49:25.832 --> 49:28.487
You'’re gonna lose another one,

49:28.530 --> 49:30.706
because we'’re not gonna
sit around waiting

49:30.750 --> 49:32.032
for another one
of your outbursts.

49:32.056 --> 49:33.274
Lola... It'’s not gonna happen.

49:33.318 --> 49:34.884
Lola, I... No, no, no, no, no.

49:34.928 --> 49:38.453
Keep walking. Keep walking.
Don'’t come home.

49:38.497 --> 49:42.892
Okay? Don'’t come home till you
figure out whatever it is

49:42.936 --> 49:44.285
that you need to figure out.

49:44.329 --> 49:46.418
But I hope that'’s not
you being some

49:46.461 --> 49:49.377
Facebook celebrity and getting
your pictures taken with people.

49:52.380 --> 49:54.121
Are you walking for Jadin, Joe?

49:55.775 --> 49:57.646
Because if you'’re walking
for Jadin,

49:57.690 --> 50:00.090
then you let Jadin let you know
when it'’s time to come home.

50:03.043 --> 50:04.653
I love you, Lola.

50:08.527 --> 50:11.138
You guys drive safe, okay?
I love you.

50:11.182 --> 50:13.358
Be safe.

50:17.536 --> 50:20.408
Be careful, all right?

So I found something,

52:52.908 --> 52:55.302
and I want you to hear it, okay?

52:55.346 --> 52:58.087
I found it in his backpack,

52:58.131 --> 52:59.915
and I wanted to... Well, what is it?

52:59.959 --> 53:01.439
Can you read it to me?

53:01.482 --> 53:03.092
Yeah. Yeah. It'’s, uh...

53:04.485 --> 53:08.054
it'’s an essay that he wrote.

53:11.927 --> 53:13.427
"It'’s a horrible thing
to be surrounded

53:13.451 --> 53:16.236
"by people who hate you

53:16.280 --> 53:18.847
"when they don'’t even know you,

53:18.891 --> 53:20.849
"for a reason you can'’t change.

53:22.416 --> 53:24.940
"One they can'’t comprehend
or understand.

53:26.899 --> 53:28.292

53:30.598 --> 53:32.252
"Some nights,
I look for the pieces

53:32.296 --> 53:33.514

53:35.995 --> 53:38.693

54:09.768 --> 54:14.686
"It'’s only getting worse.
I just want it to be over.

54:14.729 --> 54:17.254
It will be soon enough."

54:18.733 --> 54:20.300
Don'’t fucking look at us, fag.

54:23.825 --> 54:26.524
What are you doing in here?
Girl'’s bathroom's over there.

54:26.567 --> 54:29.178
Come hang out with us.

54:29.222 --> 54:31.703
What the fuck did we say
about looking at us?

54:31.746 --> 54:33.922
All he wants to do
is watch us change.

54:33.966 --> 54:37.274
He'’s shaking,
he wants it so bad.

54:37.317 --> 54:39.972
Look at him shake.Stop. Stop. Stop.

54:40.015 --> 54:43.323
It'’s okay. It's okay.
It'’s okay. It's okay.

54:43.367 --> 54:46.283
Let me ask you something.

54:46.326 --> 54:49.068
You like dick?

54:49.111 --> 54:50.548
Huh? Answer me.

54:50.591 --> 54:53.986
I think he does. You like fucking dicks.

54:54.029 --> 54:55.292
I'’ll give you dick.

54:58.207 --> 54:59.426
Stop, stop.

54:59.470 --> 55:01.646
It'’s okay, it's okay.

55:03.691 --> 55:06.128
Fuck it.
You like fucking dick?

55:06.172 --> 55:08.696
Fucking dick?
You like fucking dick!

55:13.179 --> 55:15.834
You like that?
You like that? Huh?

55:21.230 --> 55:23.537
Can we even give you
the names of the boys?

55:23.581 --> 55:25.713
No, no, no, no. No names.

55:27.889 --> 55:29.329
Have you considered
changing schools?

55:32.024 --> 55:34.026
Yeah. We applied
to another high school.

55:34.069 --> 55:36.115
We were out of their district,
so they rejected him.

55:38.204 --> 55:40.380
What about therapy?

55:40.424 --> 55:45.429
We did, um, a few sessions
of, uh, family therapy.

55:45.472 --> 55:47.561
And I don'’t need therapy.
They do.

55:47.605 --> 55:50.912
Jadin, I hear
what you'’re saying.

55:52.436 --> 55:53.785
You don'’t think the situation

55:53.828 --> 55:55.228
might settle itself down
on its own?

55:55.264 --> 55:56.396
No, I don'’t.

55:59.094 --> 56:00.748
Okay.

56:00.792 --> 56:02.402
Mr. and Mrs. Bell,

56:02.446 --> 56:05.013
I'’m not saying it was
acceptable behavior

56:05.057 --> 56:07.581
on the part of the other
students, because it wasn'’t,

56:07.625 --> 56:09.670
but we live in
a very small town,

56:09.714 --> 56:11.019
and the high school student body

56:11.063 --> 56:14.109
is a reflection
of our community.

56:14.153 --> 56:16.677
If you file a formal complaint
against these boys,

56:16.721 --> 56:19.593
it may very well cause you more
trouble in the long run

56:19.637 --> 56:20.812
than it'’s worth.

56:24.076 --> 56:25.512
You don'’t know
what it'’s like...

56:27.819 --> 56:29.124
to feel like...

56:34.565 --> 56:36.828
you have to muster up
the courage to ask for help,

56:36.871 --> 56:39.396
and then only to find out
that the person who can

56:39.439 --> 56:41.136
just couldn'’t be bothered.

56:42.311 --> 56:46.272
Son, I am trying to help you.

56:46.315 --> 56:49.101
I'’m trying to stop you
from making a mistake.

57:40.848 --> 57:42.720
Hey, it'’s Marcie.

57:44.548 --> 57:46.027
Hi, Marcie, it'’s me.

57:46.071 --> 57:48.029
Can you please call me
when you get the chance.

57:48.073 --> 57:50.771
I just need to talk to you.
Please call me when you can.

58:03.305 --> 58:05.177
Remember when we used to take...

58:05.220 --> 58:06.700
Oh, just a second.

58:06.744 --> 58:08.876
Sorry.

58:08.920 --> 58:10.095
Jadin?

58:12.532 --> 58:15.274
Hi, it'’s me.
Can you talk for a second?

58:15.317 --> 58:17.276
Jadin? Hi, it'’s Dolores.

58:17.319 --> 58:19.191
Sorry. We'’re in the car.

58:19.234 --> 58:21.367
Hi, Mrs. Roberts.
I didn'’t know it was you.

58:21.410 --> 58:24.065
I'’m taking Colleen
to go see her cousin

58:24.109 --> 58:25.763
over in Pendleton
for the weekend.

58:29.418 --> 58:32.987
Okay. Do you think you could
stop by and pick me up?

58:33.031 --> 58:35.990
We are already out of Le Grande.

58:36.034 --> 58:37.470
So I'’m sorry.

58:37.514 --> 58:39.037
But why don'’t you go

58:39.080 --> 58:41.430
to our house and relax?

58:41.474 --> 58:43.345
Be alone for a little while.

58:43.389 --> 58:45.826
I can'’t be alone right now,
okay?

58:45.870 --> 58:48.046
And I can'’t go home.

58:48.089 --> 58:49.917
So I need you to please
just come pick me up.

58:49.961 --> 58:51.571
Mom?

58:51.615 --> 58:52.790
No.

58:55.314 --> 58:57.925
Can it wait until Monday?

58:57.969 --> 59:01.320
We'’ll be back on Sunday night,
and we'’ll see you on Monday.

59:01.363 --> 59:03.540
And whatever it is,

59:03.583 --> 59:05.716
I'’m sure that we can
take care of it then.

59:05.759 --> 59:09.284
Listen, Jadin, I will call you
first thing Sunday

59:09.328 --> 59:10.895
when we get back, okay?

59:10.938 --> 59:13.245
Just...

01:00:20.051 --> 01:00:21.269
Come on, Jadin.

01:00:21.313 --> 01:00:23.750
Come on, Jadin!

01:00:23.794 --> 01:00:25.926
Come on, Jadin!

01:00:28.581 --> 01:00:30.148
No, no, no.

01:00:30.191 --> 01:00:32.629
Come on, come on, come on.

01:01:08.447 --> 01:01:10.579
Would you mind if I say grace?

01:01:10.623 --> 01:01:12.669
Sure. JIMMY: It'’s okay?

01:01:12.712 --> 01:01:14.627
No. Go ahead. It'’s okay?

01:01:22.113 --> 01:01:24.332
Our Father, who art in heaven.

01:01:24.376 --> 01:01:27.161
We come before thee
with heavy hearts.

01:01:28.728 --> 01:01:31.644
We ask that thy loving
kindness be upon us.

01:01:31.688 --> 01:01:32.950
And thy guidance.

01:01:32.993 --> 01:01:34.473
We are indeed thankful
for the gift

01:01:34.516 --> 01:01:36.562
Jadin has been in our lives.

01:01:36.605 --> 01:01:39.478
We'’ll need help
on this new path.

01:01:39.521 --> 01:01:41.567
We are thankful
for this meal before us

01:01:41.610 --> 01:01:44.004
and ask thy blessing upon it.

01:01:44.048 --> 01:01:45.745
In Jesus'’ name, Amen.

01:01:47.660 --> 01:01:49.096
Thank you.

01:02:12.685 --> 01:02:14.861
You gotta get out of this room,
Joe.

01:02:21.825 --> 01:02:23.696
You'’re pale as milk.

01:02:28.832 --> 01:02:33.924
Put some clothes on.
Go outside. Take a walk.

01:02:36.753 --> 01:02:38.232
Pretty sure it'’ll do you good.

01:02:51.768 --> 01:02:53.726
Joe, I'’m hurting too.

01:03:33.200 --> 01:03:34.549
What are you doing?

01:03:36.595 --> 01:03:38.466
Just going for a drive.

01:03:41.295 --> 01:03:42.993
Go back inside, Joseph.

01:03:45.822 --> 01:03:49.564
No. Not until you tell me
what'’s going on.

01:03:54.004 --> 01:03:55.614
Get your ass back in the house.

01:03:57.094 --> 01:03:58.617
I need to go for a drive,

01:03:58.660 --> 01:04:00.837
and you need to get back inside
and get into bed.

01:04:00.880 --> 01:04:02.012
Now.

01:04:36.002 --> 01:04:37.612
Go back inside, Joseph.

01:04:40.877 --> 01:04:42.008
Now.

01:05:47.030 --> 01:05:48.335
Shit.

01:05:52.296 --> 01:05:53.732
Here you go.

01:05:53.775 --> 01:05:55.081
Thanks, Mom. MARCIE: Thanks.

01:05:56.604 --> 01:05:58.606
Eat it while it'’s hot.

01:05:58.650 --> 01:06:00.173
Can you pass me the syrup?

01:06:00.217 --> 01:06:01.497
Yes. LOLA: I have some bacon too.

01:06:01.522 --> 01:06:03.916
It may seem...

01:06:03.960 --> 01:06:05.613
people are just
going after each other,

01:06:05.657 --> 01:06:08.181
but it requires a lot of skill.

01:06:08.225 --> 01:06:11.010
Whoa! You'’re up.

01:06:11.054 --> 01:06:12.794
Hi.

01:06:14.144 --> 01:06:15.580
Lola, I got something
to tell you.

01:06:15.623 --> 01:06:17.712
Okay. Could you give me a few minutes?

01:06:17.756 --> 01:06:20.193
Yes, Joe.

01:06:20.237 --> 01:06:22.195
What is it?

01:06:22.239 --> 01:06:26.808
I'’ve decided to walk
across America to New York City.

01:06:28.332 --> 01:06:29.550
What?

01:06:29.594 --> 01:06:30.987
Did you hear what I said?

01:06:31.030 --> 01:06:32.205
Yeah.

01:06:32.249 --> 01:06:33.467
When did you decide that?

01:06:33.511 --> 01:06:35.165
Well, just earlier this morning.

01:06:35.208 --> 01:06:38.342
When I told you to take a walk,
I meant around the block.

01:06:38.385 --> 01:06:39.865
Not to New York City. Lola,

01:06:39.908 --> 01:06:42.128
I'’ll talk to everybody
along the way.

01:06:42.172 --> 01:06:44.609
Anybody who will listen.
About bullying.

01:06:44.652 --> 01:06:47.046
About the damage it does.
About what it did to our boy.

01:06:47.090 --> 01:06:49.831
I'’m doing this for Jadin, Lola.
It'’s what he wants.

01:06:49.875 --> 01:06:51.877
It'’s what he'd want me to do,
I know it is.

01:06:51.920 --> 01:06:55.576
I mean, he told us he wanted to
live there someday, remember?

01:06:55.620 --> 01:06:58.318
Yeah. Yeah.

01:06:58.362 --> 01:07:00.842
Uh, I don'’t know.

01:07:00.886 --> 01:07:03.541
How do you...? How do you...?
How do you pay for it?

01:07:03.584 --> 01:07:06.326
Well, I'’ll... I'll get the money.
I can fundraise.

01:07:06.370 --> 01:07:08.261
I mean, everybody'’s against
bullying, aren'’t they?

01:07:08.285 --> 01:07:12.506
No. If they were,
this wouldn'’t have happened.

01:07:15.553 --> 01:07:17.922
Let me get you something to eat
before you head on the highway.

01:07:17.946 --> 01:07:20.079
So nice that you'’re
back up again.

01:07:20.123 --> 01:07:21.843
Can I get some coffee,
Marcie? MARCIE: Yeah.

01:07:24.692 --> 01:07:26.999
Hey. You didn'’t tell your mama
about last night, did you?

01:07:27.043 --> 01:07:28.479
No, sir.

01:07:28.522 --> 01:07:31.177
Come here.
I love you, buddy.

01:07:31.221 --> 01:07:32.744
Hey. I love you so much.

01:07:32.787 --> 01:07:34.417
This is gonna be
something great, all right?

01:07:34.441 --> 01:07:36.313
You'’ll see. I promise.Yeah.

01:08:02.469 --> 01:08:03.688
Joe?

01:08:05.994 --> 01:08:07.213
Joe?

01:08:07.257 --> 01:08:08.432
Lola.

01:08:11.783 --> 01:08:13.611
Joe, say something.
Why are you not talking?

01:08:13.654 --> 01:08:15.352
You'’re scaring me.

01:08:15.395 --> 01:08:18.354
I don'’t... I don't think
I can keep going.

01:08:18.398 --> 01:08:22.010
Joe... come on.

01:08:22.054 --> 01:08:24.796
You gotta keep going. I
just wanna come home.

01:08:24.839 --> 01:08:27.841
Oh, Joe, you can'’t come home.
Come on.

01:08:29.582 --> 01:08:31.716
You'’re doing it
for Jadin, remember?

01:08:31.759 --> 01:08:35.154
Yeah. For Jadin.
I remember.

01:08:35.198 --> 01:08:36.634
Yeah. And for us.

01:08:38.201 --> 01:08:40.116
Do you want to talk to Joseph?

01:08:40.158 --> 01:08:42.073
Is he there? Yeah.

01:08:42.118 --> 01:08:44.008
Yeah, he'’s getting ready
for his wrestling match.

01:08:44.032 --> 01:08:45.599
We'’re late.

01:08:45.643 --> 01:08:47.185
I know he'’d love
to talk to you, though.

01:08:47.210 --> 01:08:48.819
Not like this.

01:08:48.863 --> 01:08:50.952
Just... just tell him...

01:08:52.779 --> 01:08:55.305
tell him I'’ll call...
I'’ll call him later.

01:08:57.089 --> 01:08:59.046
Okay, okay. I'’ll tell him.

01:09:01.224 --> 01:09:02.399
Lola?

01:09:04.705 --> 01:09:06.837
I saw him.

01:09:06.881 --> 01:09:08.448
He was right there
in front of me.

01:09:10.102 --> 01:09:12.496
And he just kept leading me
for miles, and...

01:09:14.237 --> 01:09:16.108
I followed him all the way,
and then...

01:09:19.850 --> 01:09:21.331
he just disappeared.

01:09:25.639 --> 01:09:27.075
Mom! We'’re late!

01:09:28.599 --> 01:09:29.774
Joe.

01:09:31.210 --> 01:09:32.645
Mom, did you pack the shoes?

01:09:32.689 --> 01:09:34.430
Yeah. Everything'’s in there.

01:09:34.474 --> 01:09:37.085
Okay. All right.

01:09:37.129 --> 01:09:38.261
I love you.

01:09:39.609 --> 01:09:40.785
I love you.

01:09:55.930 --> 01:09:57.758
Kindness. And respect.

01:09:57.802 --> 01:10:00.128
Kindness is the most important
quality a human being can have,

01:10:00.152 --> 01:10:01.893
or that a parent can have.

01:10:01.936 --> 01:10:04.176
Shit, when I was walking and
talking these past six months,

01:10:04.200 --> 01:10:06.308
you never know how long you have
the people that you love

01:10:06.332 --> 01:10:07.986
and that love you,

01:10:08.029 --> 01:10:11.076
so you damn well
better love now, all right?

01:10:11.119 --> 01:10:12.923
No matter how confused
or misguided or messed up

01:10:12.947 --> 01:10:14.253
you think they are.

01:10:14.297 --> 01:10:15.820
Because it'’s probably
a good chance

01:10:15.863 --> 01:10:17.648
that you'’re just as messed up
as they are.

01:10:17.691 --> 01:10:20.259
You gotta look in the mirror,
and gotta have accountability.

01:10:20.303 --> 01:10:21.434
All right?

01:10:45.719 --> 01:10:47.982
Hey, there. You'’re Joe Bell?

01:10:48.026 --> 01:10:49.288
That I am. Yes.

01:10:49.332 --> 01:10:50.550
I'’ve got something for you.

01:10:52.248 --> 01:10:53.379
Oh!

01:10:54.772 --> 01:10:56.034
Holy shit!

01:10:58.036 --> 01:11:00.168
Come here!

01:11:00.212 --> 01:11:01.866
So we got Coke in here,
and some ice.

01:11:01.909 --> 01:11:03.781
We got water over here
in this one.

01:11:03.824 --> 01:11:05.391
That'’s a solar panel.

01:11:05.435 --> 01:11:08.264
We'’ll pay you for this.
You'’re a good man, Jim.

01:11:08.307 --> 01:11:10.788
Thank you so much.
Thank you.

You know, last night,
I had a corral

01:12:03.406 --> 01:12:05.843
a bunch of strangers up the
street to come and hear me talk.

01:12:05.886 --> 01:12:09.150
Shit. I gotta go.

01:12:09.194 --> 01:12:11.762
Time for me to explain myself
to another lawman.

01:12:21.380 --> 01:12:22.555
Howdy, sir.

01:12:22.599 --> 01:12:24.296
Hi.

01:12:24.340 --> 01:12:26.385
While you'’re taking your hands
out of your pockets,

01:12:26.429 --> 01:12:28.692
why don'’t you tell me
where you'’re headed.

01:12:28.735 --> 01:12:30.302
New York City.

01:12:32.130 --> 01:12:33.436
Looking for a ride
out here then?

01:12:33.479 --> 01:12:34.959
No. I'’m walking.

01:12:35.002 --> 01:12:36.656
Walking all the way to New York?

01:12:38.658 --> 01:12:40.399
Joe Bell.

01:12:40.443 --> 01:12:41.922
Yeah.

01:12:41.966 --> 01:12:43.576
Well, what'’s your mission,
Mr. Bell?

01:12:43.620 --> 01:12:45.578
Well, like it says there
on my card,

01:12:45.622 --> 01:12:47.232
I talk to people about bullying.

01:12:47.275 --> 01:12:48.905
About how it'’s not okay
to torment somebody

01:12:48.929 --> 01:12:50.366
because they'’re different
from you.

01:12:50.409 --> 01:12:51.802
Different how?

01:12:53.151 --> 01:12:55.936
Like my son Jadin.
He was gay.

01:12:55.980 --> 01:12:58.420
He was bullied so bad in school,
he couldn'’t take it anymore.

01:13:02.116 --> 01:13:03.596
You been on the road six months?

01:13:03.640 --> 01:13:04.858
Yeah.

01:13:04.902 --> 01:13:06.991
I started out
in La Grande, Oregon.

01:13:10.298 --> 01:13:12.431
When was the last time
you had a warm meal?

01:13:17.436 --> 01:13:20.657
Sam, meet my new friend,
Joe Bell.

01:13:20.700 --> 01:13:22.963
Joe, Sam.

01:13:23.007 --> 01:13:26.402
Sam'’s my girl of all work,
and our dispatcher.

01:13:26.445 --> 01:13:27.881
Have a seat.

01:13:29.622 --> 01:13:30.841
Nice to meet you, ma'’am.

01:13:30.884 --> 01:13:32.408
It'’s a pleasure, Joe.

01:13:32.451 --> 01:13:35.367
I called the chaplain
like you asked, Sheriff.

01:13:35.411 --> 01:13:37.108
He says once you give him
the green light,

01:13:37.151 --> 01:13:39.173
he'’ll announce a youth meeting
with Joe as the speaker

01:13:39.197 --> 01:13:41.242
here at the high school
this afternoon.

01:13:42.330 --> 01:13:43.723
Joe?

01:13:43.767 --> 01:13:45.159
Yeah, as long as you'’re sure

01:13:45.203 --> 01:13:46.833
you can drop me off
where you picked me up,

01:13:46.857 --> 01:13:48.878
because I intend to walk every
single step of the way.

01:13:48.902 --> 01:13:50.077
Then let'’s get you fed.

01:13:52.950 --> 01:13:56.693
Lunch here is usually
last night'’s leftovers.

01:13:56.736 --> 01:13:58.576
I'’m a sorry cook,
but I'’ve learned the basics

01:13:58.608 --> 01:13:59.783
of a microwave.

01:14:03.656 --> 01:14:06.398
That'’s my son, William.

01:14:08.705 --> 01:14:11.490
He wasn'’t your typical
teenage boy.

01:14:11.534 --> 01:14:13.840
He didn'’t have that
"girl crazy" attitude

01:14:13.884 --> 01:14:15.929
that we had when we
were his age.

01:14:19.933 --> 01:14:22.458
Janine'’s pinto beans are even
better the next day.

01:14:22.501 --> 01:14:23.807
Hmm. Yeah.

01:14:23.850 --> 01:14:25.504
And the day after that.

01:14:25.548 --> 01:14:27.468
I haven'’t had beans this good
since I left home.

01:14:28.768 --> 01:14:30.814
The stove is strictly
Janine'’s domain.

01:14:30.857 --> 01:14:32.903
I barely know how to boil water.

01:14:32.946 --> 01:14:34.121
She'’s a keeper.

01:14:37.516 --> 01:14:41.651
I was on the family computer
one day, and I...

01:14:41.694 --> 01:14:43.174
I saw that Will
had been searching

01:14:43.217 --> 01:14:44.741
what it meant to be gay.

01:14:54.011 --> 01:14:56.187
I have to admit, at first, I...

01:14:58.145 --> 01:15:01.409
I worried that I'’d been
too tough on him growing up.

01:15:01.453 --> 01:15:03.411
We were raised Christians,
after all.

01:15:06.023 --> 01:15:08.460
I wondered if he might have
told me sooner himself

01:15:08.504 --> 01:15:12.551
if I hadn'’t been
such a hard-core lawman.

01:15:12.595 --> 01:15:15.685
I thought about that same thing.

01:15:15.728 --> 01:15:18.165
About whether I was
too hard on my boy.

01:15:18.209 --> 01:15:21.038
Well, if Jadin knew
before he died

01:15:21.081 --> 01:15:25.216
that you loved him
and accepted him, that'’s what...

01:15:25.259 --> 01:15:27.697
that'’s what matters, isn'’t it?

01:15:27.740 --> 01:15:29.457
I want to believe
that that'’s the way it was,

01:15:29.481 --> 01:15:32.919
but I don'’t know if it was.

01:15:36.619 --> 01:15:38.969
When I broke the news to my dad

01:15:39.012 --> 01:15:42.146
that his oldest grandson
was gay, he surprised me.

01:15:42.189 --> 01:15:44.365
He'’s a Marine.

01:15:44.409 --> 01:15:46.324
And he was a lot more accepting

01:15:46.367 --> 01:15:48.369
of William being gay than I was.

01:15:51.503 --> 01:15:54.158
And that made me take a long,
hard look at myself.

01:15:57.640 --> 01:15:59.946
My father didn'’t understand.

01:15:59.990 --> 01:16:02.340
Still doesn'’t to this day,
even with Jadin being gone.

01:16:04.342 --> 01:16:06.910
You know a lot of folks believe
that being gay is a choice?

01:16:08.520 --> 01:16:09.956
All things being equal,

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:12.219
Jadin would have never
chosen to be bullied.

01:16:12.263 --> 01:16:13.656
With all things being equal,

01:16:13.699 --> 01:16:15.832
he would have never chosen
the way he died.

01:16:17.921 --> 01:16:19.096
You know, Ben...

01:16:20.967 --> 01:16:22.534
when I started out walking...

01:16:24.144 --> 01:16:26.494
I didn'’t know
what I was doing, really.

01:16:26.538 --> 01:16:30.063
I thought I just wanted
to make Jadin'’s life...

01:16:31.935 --> 01:16:33.980
and his death matter somehow.

01:16:37.157 --> 01:16:38.332
But what I come to know...

01:16:40.378 --> 01:16:42.095
is I'’ve been walking
and trying to figure out

01:16:42.119 --> 01:16:43.773
why my son did what he did.

01:16:47.341 --> 01:16:49.256
And make sense out
of the part that I played

01:16:49.300 --> 01:16:50.954
in his decision to end his life.

01:16:53.696 --> 01:16:56.655
I mean, I was too caught up
in my own feelings

01:16:56.699 --> 01:16:58.091
about what other people
would think

01:16:58.135 --> 01:17:00.920
to see how alone
my own son must have felt.

01:17:00.964 --> 01:17:03.140
I should'’ve known how bad
it was for him.

01:17:03.183 --> 01:17:05.621
I... I should'’ve known
all along.

01:17:05.664 --> 01:17:06.926
But instead I just...

01:17:10.669 --> 01:17:13.759
I just made Jadin'’s being gay
all about Joe Bell.

01:17:15.674 --> 01:17:16.806
About me.

01:17:18.155 --> 01:17:19.373
Not about my boy.

01:17:27.338 --> 01:17:28.513
Joe...

01:17:31.734 --> 01:17:34.432
I think you made me
realize something.

01:17:38.697 --> 01:17:41.178
It never crossed my mind until
this very moment that...

01:17:43.180 --> 01:17:46.487
William might have considered
taking his own life.

01:17:53.756 --> 01:17:56.367
I don'’t think I could've
carried on if he had.

01:18:08.814 --> 01:18:10.555
I never let him know
it was okay.

01:18:12.165 --> 01:18:13.601
And I gotta live with that.

01:18:16.909 --> 01:18:19.216
Don'’t make that same mistake,
Ben.

01:18:19.259 --> 01:18:21.348
Don'’t do that to your son
or yourself.

01:19:25.064 --> 01:19:26.239
Um...

01:19:30.853 --> 01:19:31.984
Shh!

01:19:35.596 --> 01:19:37.337
Uh...

01:19:37.381 --> 01:19:39.165
thanks for having me here today.

01:19:39.209 --> 01:19:41.820
Uh, my name is Joe Bell.

01:19:41.864 --> 01:19:44.867
I'’m really honored to be here
to speak with you today

01:19:44.910 --> 01:19:47.217
about something that I feel
is very, very important

01:19:47.260 --> 01:19:50.089
not only to myself,
but to all of you.

01:20:38.659 --> 01:20:40.444
I think you and I
are a lot more alike

01:20:40.487 --> 01:20:42.359
than you'’d want to admit, Dad.

01:20:47.494 --> 01:20:52.195
It took me 13 years

01:20:52.238 --> 01:20:57.983
to realize that living a lie
wasn'’t really living at all.

01:20:59.202 --> 01:21:00.943
It only took you six months.

01:21:02.161 --> 01:21:03.336
No, son.

01:21:05.948 --> 01:21:08.341
It took me 45 years
and six months.

01:21:10.039 --> 01:21:11.605
I'’m sorry, Jadin.

01:21:11.649 --> 01:21:13.259
I'’m so sorry.

01:21:20.745 --> 01:21:24.053
I never meant for you to feel
that I didn'’t love you.

01:21:26.838 --> 01:21:28.231
No, son. I never felt that.

01:21:31.408 --> 01:21:32.975
And I always knew you loved me.

01:21:35.238 --> 01:21:36.456
Everything just...

01:21:37.980 --> 01:21:39.329
hurt so much.

01:21:42.898 --> 01:21:44.987
But deep down, I always knew.

01:21:47.728 --> 01:21:49.252
That means the world to me, son.

01:21:51.036 --> 01:21:52.646
The whole breathing world.

01:22:14.059 --> 01:22:15.234
Dad?

01:22:20.283 --> 01:22:21.458
I love you.

01:22:25.418 --> 01:22:27.551
I know. I know.

01:22:33.122 --> 01:22:34.340
I love you, buddy.

01:22:45.438 --> 01:22:48.006
Hey, Lola, honey. It'’s me.

01:22:48.050 --> 01:22:50.878
The reason I'’m calling is
to tell you that I love you.

01:22:50.922 --> 01:22:52.054
You and Joseph.

01:22:55.057 --> 01:22:57.624
Thanks for putting up with me
all these years.

01:22:57.668 --> 01:22:59.298
I don'’t know what would've
happened to me

01:22:59.322 --> 01:23:00.952
if you hadn'’t come along
and taken me in.

01:23:00.976 --> 01:23:03.674
I'’m just truly lucky
to have my family.

01:23:06.111 --> 01:23:08.592
There'’s a lot of things
I'’ve learned out here,

01:23:08.635 --> 01:23:10.376
with nobody but me for company.

01:23:12.074 --> 01:23:13.640
Some of it'’s been hard
to come to know.

01:23:15.338 --> 01:23:17.601
Real hard.

01:23:17.644 --> 01:23:19.864
I know I'’ve still got
a long road ahead of me.

01:23:19.907 --> 01:23:22.016
And I'’ll be better about
staying in touch from now on.

01:23:22.040 --> 01:23:23.172
You'’ll see.

01:23:24.564 --> 01:23:26.479
You give my love to our boy.

01:23:26.523 --> 01:23:27.828
I love you.

01:23:42.495 --> 01:23:44.671
Sheriff Westin.

01:23:44.715 --> 01:23:46.847
Sheriff, you'’re requested
on scene.

01:23:46.891 --> 01:23:48.284
U.S. 40 just west
of Wild Horse,

01:23:48.327 --> 01:23:50.590
a pedestrian was struck.
