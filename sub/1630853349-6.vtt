WEBVTT

01:41.400 --> 01:43.600
<i>The orgy will begin in half an hour.</i>

01:43.680 --> 01:46.680
<i>Lube is available</i>
<i>near the make-your-own-pasta station.</i>

01:46.760 --> 01:48.240
<i>I'm Maria Menounos.</i>

01:49.400 --> 01:50.840
In a few short hours,

01:50.920 --> 01:55.080
we'll be the richest human beings
in the history of mankind.

01:55.160 --> 01:57.520
-Go check on Ken Scarborough.
-Gunter!

02:17.720 --> 02:19.440
Is your name even Reilly?

02:19.520 --> 02:21.800
Yes. Let me explain.

02:22.680 --> 02:25.920
There's a power struggle
going on in the Pentaverate right now.

02:26.000 --> 02:28.840
Bruce and Skip are trying to destroy
everything we stand for.

02:29.880 --> 02:32.480
Lordington, Mishu, and Shep
want to save it.

02:33.520 --> 02:35.360
Sorry. I'm jumping ahead.

02:37.200 --> 02:39.800
<i>I was recruited into the Fimbra Manus</i>
<i>from Cambridge.</i>

02:40.440 --> 02:42.920
<i>I was thrilled</i>
<i>to be part of a secret organization</i>

02:43.000 --> 02:44.400
<i>that was actually doing good</i>

02:45.480 --> 02:48.640
<i>and trying to create the kind of world</i>
<i>that I wanted to live in.</i>

02:54.160 --> 02:56.280
<i>Of course, then I meet the top guys,</i>

02:56.360 --> 03:00.040
<i>and it's just old white man</i>
<i>after older white man</i>

03:00.120 --> 03:05.040
<i>after older, whiter, richer man</i>
<i>after oldest, whitest, richest man.</i>

03:06.040 --> 03:09.000
<i> I mean, if the most diversity</i>
<i>in your group is Russian,</i>

03:09.080 --> 03:10.720
<i>you just know</i>
<i>it's gonna be the usual deal,</i>

03:10.800 --> 03:13.400
<i>which is tons of diversity</i>
<i>on the lower levels,</i>

03:13.480 --> 03:16.400
<i>then you bang your head</i>
<i>on that old, white ceiling.</i>

03:16.480 --> 03:18.800
<i>They were never gonna let us</i>
<i>be part of making decisions</i>

03:18.880 --> 03:21.720
<i>in a world that's made up</i>
<i>of a lot more us's than thems.</i>

03:22.560 --> 03:25.280
-Three-sixty, yeah.
-Patty.

03:25.360 --> 03:26.920
<i>So I went to see Patty,</i>

03:27.000 --> 03:29.640
<i>because she's been fighting</i>
<i>for diversity for years.</i>

03:30.200 --> 03:34.600
<i>Of course, she's not in the inner circle,</i>
<i>but she did get me in to see Lordington.</i>

03:36.000 --> 03:40.080
I thought my head was gonna be spiked
like a kebab for speaking out, but no.

03:40.680 --> 03:42.960
<i>They asked me to head up a secret mission,</i>

03:43.040 --> 03:46.080
<i>so secret that no one else</i>
<i>outside the room knew about it.</i>

03:46.640 --> 03:49.240
<i>All I was told was, "Go to Canada."</i>

03:49.320 --> 03:53.040
<i>"Find this individual.</i>
<i>Get him into the Liechtenstein Guard."</i>

03:53.120 --> 03:54.800
I know, right?

03:54.880 --> 03:57.040
Another old, white man.

03:57.120 --> 03:58.760
I'm not that old.

03:58.840 --> 04:01.760
<i>But Patty said Lordington</i>
<i>was the only one she trusted.</i>

04:01.840 --> 04:04.160
<i>He had a plan, and he was my only hope.</i>

04:04.880 --> 04:08.000
<i>But first, I had to learn</i>
<i>how to be Canadian.</i>

04:08.080 --> 04:09.240
Again.

04:09.720 --> 04:12.360
Sorry,
but the moose is loose around the house.

04:12.440 --> 04:13.600
Next sentence.

04:13.680 --> 04:17.040
-My mom says my dog is conceited, eh?
-Take that one again, but slow it down.

04:17.120 --> 04:19.440
-My mom says my dog is conceited, eh?
-Great.

04:24.560 --> 04:27.880
<i>Then I went to learn everything I could</i>
<i>about Ken Scarborough.</i>

04:33.520 --> 04:35.200
<i>I knew I was gonna need some help</i>

04:35.280 --> 04:37.880
<i>getting you to follow a story</i>
<i>all the way to the States.</i>

04:37.960 --> 04:41.800
<i>He didn't know it, but I used Anthony</i>
<i>to get you excited about the Pentaverate.</i>

04:41.880 --> 04:44.600
<i>The man with the mustache</i>
<i>worked for me all along,</i>

04:44.680 --> 04:47.360
<i>because, well, nothing lures</i>
<i>someone into an adventure</i>

04:47.440 --> 04:51.120
<i>like a mysterious mustachioed man</i>
<i>with a menacing memo.</i>

04:52.680 --> 04:55.320
<i>And Captain Whitford's</i>
<i>one of ours as well.</i>

04:55.400 --> 04:57.680
<i>Sorry. You know him as Sammy.</i>

04:57.760 --> 04:58.760
<i>Once you got the fob,</i>

04:58.840 --> 05:01.840
<i>I managed to fast-track you</i>
<i>into the Guard in Higgins' office.</i>

05:03.000 --> 05:05.880
I have no idea
why you still got the tug test.

05:07.040 --> 05:08.400
But then things got out of hand.

05:09.120 --> 05:10.280
Jason was murdered.

05:10.360 --> 05:12.960
And so was
the Pentaverate's first Black member.

05:13.040 --> 05:16.040
Lordington told me to hold fast
as our plan could still work,

05:16.120 --> 05:19.040
but after the Maester was killed,
I didn't think you'd be sent to Dubrovnik,

05:19.120 --> 05:22.080
and nobody expected you
to fuse with the spare key.

05:23.240 --> 05:26.280
So, the mustache man and I
were able to help you escape.

05:26.360 --> 05:27.680
<i>But yet again…</i>

05:27.760 --> 05:29.160
Oh, shit.

05:29.240 --> 05:30.800
<i>…Bruce was one step ahead.</i>

05:32.600 --> 05:33.960
So here we are.

05:34.520 --> 05:36.320
And now The Meadows have started.

05:37.160 --> 05:39.200
This can't just be about diversifying.

05:39.280 --> 05:42.080
We now have to save
the whole world from Bruce.

05:45.200 --> 05:46.400
But basically,

05:47.040 --> 05:48.640
you lied to me, Reilly.

05:50.720 --> 05:52.720
How am I supposed to trust you now?

05:53.440 --> 05:55.200
I'm so sorry, Ken.

05:56.040 --> 05:57.080
You were my mission,

05:57.160 --> 06:01.000
but as I got to know you,
I understood why you were the mission.

06:02.840 --> 06:06.760
I can see the truth and goodness
in your heart.

06:12.400 --> 06:14.200
It's a lot to process.

06:14.280 --> 06:18.760
You know, like five minutes ago, I was
in Toronto trying to get my job back.

06:20.240 --> 06:21.440
What happens next?

06:21.520 --> 06:23.560
I don't know
the next steps of the plan,

06:24.160 --> 06:26.360
but I trust that whatever Lordington
and Patty are up to,

06:26.440 --> 06:28.600
it's for the greater good. Please.

06:29.280 --> 06:31.880
I really do believe in you.

06:34.720 --> 06:36.280
And I believe in you, kid.

06:39.680 --> 06:42.320
-Is he part of the plan?
-No.

06:44.640 --> 06:46.400
What's going on down there?

06:47.760 --> 06:51.920
"I'm breaking you out.
Count to three, then duck."

06:52.000 --> 06:54.320
One, two,

06:54.400 --> 06:55.360
three.

07:04.760 --> 07:05.960
We'd better get moving.

07:12.120 --> 07:14.360
Save the Pentaverate!

07:19.800 --> 07:21.760
<i>In 1347,</i>

07:21.840 --> 07:23.560
<i>blah, blah, blah.</i>

07:24.160 --> 07:25.280
<i>Fuck it.</i>

07:36.520 --> 07:38.320
Shit!

07:48.040 --> 07:50.640
Stop the Canadian!

07:50.720 --> 07:51.640
Run!

07:54.760 --> 07:56.320
Freeze!

07:56.400 --> 07:58.360
-This way!
-No, this way!

08:10.160 --> 08:11.680
<i>Please find your seats.</i>

08:11.760 --> 08:15.720
<i>The Meadows' main presentation</i>
<i>will be starting shortly.</i>

08:15.800 --> 08:17.880
<i>And please beware the moon door.</i>

08:17.960 --> 08:21.240
<i>-You could fall to your certain death.</i>

08:22.680 --> 08:23.520
Reilly?

08:24.360 --> 08:25.320
Stop!

08:40.200 --> 08:42.200
No clothes allowed in the orgy room.

08:42.280 --> 08:45.160
All right. Well, you see, a buddy
of mine's inside, and I'm just about to--

08:45.240 --> 08:47.000
Shh. Shh. Shh. Shh.

08:47.080 --> 08:48.040
Strip.

09:01.640 --> 09:04.280
Well, we tried
to give Mr. Myers creative license,

09:04.360 --> 09:06.720
but, again, he's abused that privilege.

09:07.880 --> 09:10.680
Nobody needs to see his button on a bush.

09:10.760 --> 09:12.920
So we're gonna blur any nudity
in this next scene

09:13.000 --> 09:16.560
using our state-of-the-art
pixelation algorithm, Fix-Plix.

09:19.040 --> 09:22.480
Now, we're still beta testing it,
but let's try it now.

09:22.560 --> 09:25.920
See if we can pixelate
this filthy, filthy scene.

09:30.200 --> 09:32.040
Oh, yeah. Thank you so much.

09:34.480 --> 09:36.400
Hey, buddy. How's it going? Good?

09:37.800 --> 09:39.240
Oh, sausages!

09:39.320 --> 09:40.840
Hey, I'll have one of those, yep!

10:08.800 --> 10:10.520
-Goddamn it!

10:11.840 --> 10:12.840
Goddamn it!

10:25.760 --> 10:29.280
As you can see, there are still
some bugs to be worked out.

10:37.520 --> 10:39.320
Reilly, what happened to you?

10:39.400 --> 10:41.360
What happened to me? What happened to you?

10:41.880 --> 10:43.480
I hear the Canadians.

10:45.080 --> 10:46.920
-Let's go! This way.
-Okay.

10:47.000 --> 10:48.600
Left, left, left, left, left!

10:56.720 --> 10:58.400
The Liechtenstein Guard?

10:59.200 --> 11:00.760
Holy crap, it's Ken.

11:00.840 --> 11:02.480
-And a woman.

11:02.560 --> 11:03.960
What are you guys doing?

11:04.040 --> 11:05.720
We're no match for the Red Robes,

11:05.800 --> 11:07.960
so why don't you pull up a chair
and play Ticket to Ride.

11:08.040 --> 11:11.760
You guys are the Liechtenstein Guard.
Have you no dignity?

11:11.840 --> 11:13.160
With all due respect, Ken,

11:13.240 --> 11:16.520
we're not the ones
wearing an upside-down T-shirt diaper.

11:18.520 --> 11:19.520
Get me a shield.

11:20.200 --> 11:21.120
And a uniform.

11:21.200 --> 11:22.040
Thank you.

11:22.880 --> 11:25.720
Have you guys lost sight
of what you stand for?

11:25.800 --> 11:28.280
-Face it, Ken, it's over.
-Over?

11:32.560 --> 11:35.440
Smitty, who gave you a place
that you can call home

11:35.520 --> 11:37.320
after you were out on the streets?

11:37.400 --> 11:39.560
-The Liechtenstein Guard.
-Yeah.

11:39.640 --> 11:44.280
Anderson, when your mom died,
who gave you a shoulder to cry on?

11:44.360 --> 11:46.640
-Liechtenstein Guard.
-Yes.

11:46.720 --> 11:48.920
-We're gonna do this for Higgins.
-Yes!

11:49.000 --> 11:51.240
We can beat those Red Robes!

11:51.320 --> 11:52.440
Yes!

11:52.520 --> 11:54.920
-Because who are we?
-The Liechtenstein Guard!

11:55.000 --> 11:57.520
I'm sorry, I can't hear you. Who are we?

11:57.600 --> 11:59.760
The Liechtenstein Guard!

11:59.840 --> 12:01.720
This is my crossbow.

12:01.800 --> 12:04.320
There are many like it,
but this one is mine.

12:04.400 --> 12:07.640
Without my crossbow,
I am useless.

12:07.720 --> 12:09.680
My weapons are old-timey,

12:09.760 --> 12:12.920
but my commitment
to the Pentaverate is not.

12:13.000 --> 12:17.120
I care not if I'm killed
by automatic gunfire.

12:17.200 --> 12:18.240
Or grenades.

12:18.320 --> 12:20.080
Or rocket launchers.

12:20.160 --> 12:22.080
To the Liechtenstein Guard!

12:22.160 --> 12:24.880
-Let's go! Let's go!

12:32.120 --> 12:35.080
-There you are!

12:35.160 --> 12:37.520
You made it. You made it. G'day.

12:39.680 --> 12:42.800
Oh! Don't you all look wonderful tonight.

12:42.880 --> 12:44.680
-Yes!

12:44.760 --> 12:47.280
Oh, Angela Merkel has just entered.

12:47.360 --> 12:50.440
Let's give a big round of applause
for Angela Merkel!

12:52.320 --> 12:55.200
I've known Ang for many years.

12:55.280 --> 12:57.800
She always likes
a warm hand on her entrance.

13:02.000 --> 13:02.840
Thank you.

13:02.920 --> 13:06.600
Well, here we are at The Meadows, which is
a big part of the Pentaverate calendar.

13:06.680 --> 13:09.560
We've had
a particularly fantastic year this year.

13:09.640 --> 13:12.800
We've tackled
one of humanity's greatest problems.

13:12.880 --> 13:14.200
Climate change!

13:17.040 --> 13:20.800
We've done that with the help
of our supercomputer, MENTOR,

13:21.320 --> 13:23.480
the gold standard of truth.

13:25.520 --> 13:28.000
It is too bad

13:28.080 --> 13:31.360
that the people
are too stupid to deserve the truth.

13:32.800 --> 13:35.080
Yeah, that's right, I said stupid.

13:35.640 --> 13:38.840
They're so stupid
that they give away their privacy online

13:38.920 --> 13:40.800
just to be mindlessly entertained.

13:41.800 --> 13:44.360
So stupid that they give away
their personal data

13:44.440 --> 13:47.960
just to have that data weaponized
against them, and they don't care.

13:48.920 --> 13:50.840
They don't deserve the truth.

13:52.600 --> 13:53.800
But you do.

13:54.320 --> 13:56.520
Ladies and gentlemen, I give you MENTOR!

13:59.400 --> 14:00.560
Wow!

14:02.120 --> 14:03.880
With these three keys,

14:03.960 --> 14:06.000
I now control the Pentaverate.

14:06.560 --> 14:07.600
So tonight,

14:08.320 --> 14:10.080
I'm selling off MENTOR,

14:10.160 --> 14:11.240
its truth,

14:12.080 --> 14:13.680
its known facts,

14:13.760 --> 14:15.240
to the highest bidder.

14:21.400 --> 14:22.280
Fine.

14:22.880 --> 14:24.960
Go! Who needs you?

14:25.880 --> 14:28.280
Don't let the door hit you
where the good Lord split you.

14:29.480 --> 14:31.440
Now, for the rest of you
that want to stay,

14:31.520 --> 14:35.640
do you have a fact in your past you'd like
to have removed from the public record?

14:35.720 --> 14:38.200
Don't worry, MENTOR is your friend.

14:38.280 --> 14:43.080
Or maybe you're a do-gooder, and you want
to actually solve climate change.

14:43.800 --> 14:46.480
But more than likely,
if you're still here,

14:46.560 --> 14:50.720
you're looking for scientific proof
that there never was climate change.

14:50.800 --> 14:51.920
It doesn't matter to me.

14:52.880 --> 14:55.200
So let's start the bidding, shall we?

14:55.280 --> 14:58.720
The bidding starts at 17 trillion dollars.

15:00.240 --> 15:01.520
Do I hear 18?

15:02.120 --> 15:03.760
Do I hear 19?

15:03.840 --> 15:05.280
Do I hear 20-teen?

15:05.360 --> 15:07.000
-Hey, Bruce.
-Twenty-one-teen?

15:07.080 --> 15:08.800
Bruce. The Canadian's escaped.

15:08.880 --> 15:09.920
Escaped?

15:10.000 --> 15:11.720
Escaped? How the fuck did that happen?

15:11.800 --> 15:14.560
Don't worry. He's no match
for the Red Robes. They got this.

15:16.320 --> 15:17.840
Twenty-two-teen.

15:20.120 --> 15:22.000
Tallyho!

15:53.440 --> 15:54.560
Make ready.

16:01.360 --> 16:02.200
Fire!

16:14.280 --> 16:17.880
Let's get out of here!
Move it! Move it! Come on!

16:26.400 --> 16:27.720
Shield formation!

16:49.200 --> 16:50.640
Second formation!

16:53.880 --> 16:55.040
Fire!

17:00.960 --> 17:02.600
Right in the schnitzel!

17:03.480 --> 17:06.520
-Yeah!
-31-teen, 32-teen.

17:07.120 --> 17:09.240
-Let's go!

17:09.320 --> 17:12.680
-What is going on here, Baldwin?
-Nothing to be concerned about.

17:12.760 --> 17:16.280
Let's just keep the bidding going,
shall we? Going once!

17:16.360 --> 17:18.240
-Let's go!

17:18.320 --> 17:21.560
Hands up! Hands up! Hands up!
Everybody, I said hands up!

17:21.640 --> 17:22.520
Fucking hell.

17:25.200 --> 17:28.320
Your Red Robes have been defeated, Bruce.

17:39.680 --> 17:41.360
Holy shit,

17:41.440 --> 17:43.400
there really is a Meadows!

17:44.480 --> 17:45.720
Bruce Baldwin!

17:45.800 --> 17:47.720
I knew you were in the Pentaverate.

17:47.800 --> 17:51.400
Well, well, well. Anthony Lansdowne.

17:51.480 --> 17:52.920
You know my name?

17:53.000 --> 17:57.120
Of course I do. You conspiracy nuts
were the easiest people to control.

17:57.200 --> 17:59.600
You don't control me.

18:04.400 --> 18:06.600
-I'm a free man.
-Wanna bet, mate?

18:07.760 --> 18:09.040
You're not a free man.

18:10.400 --> 18:11.640
You're a slave.

18:12.520 --> 18:14.720
You're a slave to every conspiracy theory

18:14.800 --> 18:17.720
that says that there's an other
keeping you down.

18:17.800 --> 18:20.080
An other who took your job,

18:20.720 --> 18:22.200
your tax dollars,

18:22.280 --> 18:24.720
your culture, your country.

18:25.760 --> 18:31.080
So you all get together and dress alike
and make up your own flags.

18:32.000 --> 18:33.320
Well, I've got news for you.

18:34.920 --> 18:36.360
There is no other.

18:37.320 --> 18:38.560
There's just you.

18:39.960 --> 18:42.800
You're why the American dream
passed you by.

18:44.720 --> 18:45.600
But…

18:50.480 --> 18:52.720
What the blazes is going on here?

18:53.520 --> 18:56.120
Ah, there you are. Just in time.

18:56.200 --> 18:58.560
Okay, Bruce, we've heard enough.
Hands out.

18:58.640 --> 19:00.960
-Okay, there you go. Now, nobody move!
-No!

19:01.040 --> 19:03.320
-Or the sheila gets it!

19:03.920 --> 19:05.360
Prepare the Da Vinci lock.

19:05.440 --> 19:07.160
Everybody, back off.

19:07.240 --> 19:09.200
Don't do anything crazy, Bruce.

19:09.280 --> 19:10.520
Too late now, mate.

19:10.600 --> 19:13.960
You forced my hand when you forced me
into this Pentaverate hellhole.

19:15.160 --> 19:16.800
-Putin.
-<i>Da.</i>

19:16.880 --> 19:21.320
You're the highest bidder. Going once,
going twice, going three times. Sold!

19:23.880 --> 19:26.720
Game, set, and match, motherfucker.

19:26.800 --> 19:27.960
Three keys, Ken.

19:28.040 --> 19:29.480
Take theParce Clavem,

19:29.560 --> 19:32.400
'cause now only you can use
the fucking key.

19:32.480 --> 19:36.160
Put the key into the Da Vinci lock,
or I blow her fucking head off.

19:36.800 --> 19:39.560
Don't do it, Ken! I'm willing to die
for the betterment of humanity.

19:40.160 --> 19:43.680
Reilly lied to you, Ken.
The Pentaverate's a bad organization.

19:43.760 --> 19:47.080
You got red-pilled,
but you can take the blue pill again.

19:47.160 --> 19:48.440
Forget all about this.

19:48.520 --> 19:51.160
You can stay local,
you can go back to your old life,

19:51.240 --> 19:53.440
and leave the big world stuff to us.

19:54.040 --> 19:55.720
You're a good man, Ken.

19:55.800 --> 19:56.960
Do the right thing.

19:57.040 --> 20:00.160
-Turn the key, my friend.
-Don't do it. Don't do it.

20:02.040 --> 20:03.640
Turn the key

20:03.720 --> 20:04.760
on three.

20:06.480 --> 20:07.560
One.

20:07.640 --> 20:08.960
Don't do it, Ken.

20:09.480 --> 20:11.080
-Two.
-Stop "cunting."

20:11.680 --> 20:12.760
Three.

20:13.480 --> 20:15.680
No!

20:19.760 --> 20:21.000
What have you done?

20:21.080 --> 20:23.760
The Pentaverate must never be exposed.

20:24.560 --> 20:27.240
The people need to trust the experts.

20:28.040 --> 20:31.840
But the experts need to serve the people.

20:36.800 --> 20:38.360
That was a really great speech.

20:38.840 --> 20:40.600
You made a compelling case.

20:42.800 --> 20:43.960
I'm only kidding.

20:44.040 --> 20:46.760
I'm taking this little lady hostage,
and I'm getting out of here.

20:48.760 --> 20:50.040
-Hey, Bruce!
-What the--

20:50.120 --> 20:51.120
Freedom!

20:51.960 --> 20:55.560
-Oh!
-But what about her emails?

20:55.640 --> 20:58.640
-Ah!
-Bloody hell!

20:58.720 --> 21:00.920
-See you later, Bruce.
-See you next fall.

21:01.000 --> 21:02.720
-Ken!
-Oh! There you are.

21:05.040 --> 21:06.520
Shep, Mishu,

21:07.160 --> 21:09.960
I motion to enact the Demetrius Protocols.

21:10.040 --> 21:10.920
Seconded.

21:11.000 --> 21:13.040
-Affirmed.
-Observed.

21:13.720 --> 21:16.720
-<i>Claves.</i>
-Wait, no! No! Put down the keys!

21:17.240 --> 21:20.040
<i>Parare.</i>
-Wait, stop! What are you doing?

21:20.760 --> 21:23.320
<i>-Vobis.</i>

21:23.400 --> 21:25.640
Don't destroy the Pentaverate!

21:26.680 --> 21:29.560
<i> Holy crap!</i>
<i>The Demetrius Protocols…</i>

21:29.640 --> 21:32.720
-<i> …have been enacted.</i>

21:32.800 --> 21:35.720
Ah! Out of my way!

21:35.800 --> 21:39.800
Patty, as you know,
the Demetrius Protocols exist

21:39.880 --> 21:43.760
in the event that the Pentaverate
should fall into nefarious hands.

21:44.720 --> 21:46.240
The world has changed.

21:46.760 --> 21:49.040
The Pentaverate has not.

21:49.120 --> 21:52.800
We have become those nefarious hands.

21:52.880 --> 21:54.920
In the words of Alice Cooper,

21:55.000 --> 21:57.680
"Sometimes you gotta know
when to get off the stage."

21:57.760 --> 21:58.920
School's out…

22:00.920 --> 22:01.760
forever.

22:01.840 --> 22:03.440
No, Shep! Shep, wait!

22:10.680 --> 22:13.000
<i> The Demetrius Protocols</i>
<i>have been enacted.</i>

22:13.080 --> 22:16.120
<i>The Demetrius Protocols</i>
<i>have been enacted.</i>

22:18.640 --> 22:19.960
<i>I'm getting the fuck outta here.</i>

22:20.040 --> 22:23.000
<i>The Demetrius Protocols</i>
<i>have been enacted.</i>

22:25.240 --> 22:26.840
<i>Ah. Hello!</i>

22:26.920 --> 22:29.400
<i>The Demetrius Protocols</i>
<i>have been enacted.</i>

22:30.520 --> 22:31.840
<i>Shit, let me out!</i>

22:33.120 --> 22:34.600
<i>I'm Maria Menounos!</i>

22:34.680 --> 22:37.080
<i>The Demetrius Protocols</i>
<i>have been enacted.</i>

22:39.080 --> 22:43.440
Reilly, thank you for delivering us
the soul that will save MENTOR.

22:44.040 --> 22:47.120
<i>Initiating new soul transfer procedure.</i>

22:48.800 --> 22:49.720
I don't understand.

22:49.800 --> 22:52.360
That Canadian,
he has kindness in his heart,

22:52.440 --> 22:54.360
as is the way of his people.

22:54.960 --> 22:56.680
<i>MENTOR needs a soul.</i>

22:56.760 --> 22:59.040
<i>Someone kind, someone empathetic.</i>

23:00.160 --> 23:02.440
<i>New soul, Ken Scarborough,</i>

23:02.520 --> 23:04.160
<i>take your position, please.</i>

23:10.440 --> 23:12.840
Wait, Ken, I didn't know
that I was enlisting your soul.

23:12.920 --> 23:14.640
You don't have to do this.

23:14.720 --> 23:16.320
You were right all along.

23:17.240 --> 23:19.640
My journey's not over.
It's just beginning.

23:20.560 --> 23:24.240
But I realize now
that my kindness is my strength,

23:24.320 --> 23:28.240
and if my kindness
is what it takes to save MENTOR,

23:29.560 --> 23:31.120
I'm happy to do it.

23:33.560 --> 23:36.240
This is my destiny.

23:37.640 --> 23:39.400
No, you can't do this!

23:39.480 --> 23:41.200
It's too risky.

23:41.280 --> 23:42.440
I'm scared.

23:42.520 --> 23:44.920
You know, a smart person once said to me,

23:45.000 --> 23:47.280
"That's how you know
it's the right thing to do."

23:50.200 --> 23:51.680
You're gonna be okay.

24:03.480 --> 24:06.200
<i>Soul transfer subject in place.</i>

24:06.280 --> 24:10.200
<i>Initializing soul upload</i>
<i>and transfer procedure.</i>

24:10.800 --> 24:11.880
It's time.

24:12.520 --> 24:14.040
Please. Don't leave me.

24:14.760 --> 24:16.440
You must let go, Patty.

24:17.640 --> 24:18.600
Sir, it's been…

24:18.680 --> 24:20.680
…an honor working with you.

24:22.080 --> 24:23.120
Thank you, Patty.

24:23.880 --> 24:26.440
Thank you, Lord Lordington.

24:37.120 --> 24:39.760
<i>Bystanders,</i>
<i>please clear the area.</i>

24:57.680 --> 24:58.840
I understand.

25:23.360 --> 25:28.200
I'm pleased to announce
the Lagrange Point Lens is now in orbit.

25:28.280 --> 25:29.800
And that's a happy.

25:30.800 --> 25:32.760
Thank you, Patty.

25:33.600 --> 25:35.240
With our Lagrange Point Project,

25:35.320 --> 25:39.760
we are one step closer to solving
the issues that affect our global climate.

25:40.600 --> 25:41.680
Go ahead, KENTOR.

25:43.040 --> 25:44.640
<i> Hey there, Septaverate.</i>

25:44.720 --> 25:45.720
<i>KENTOR here.</i>

25:45.800 --> 25:49.240
<i>The Lagrange Point Lens</i>
<i>has been activated, eh?</i>

25:49.320 --> 25:51.560
<i>What are we working on next?</i>

25:51.640 --> 25:54.200
So, next on the agenda,

25:55.120 --> 25:56.240
let's discuss…

25:57.680 --> 26:01.440
<i>And so</i>
<i>a new secret society was born.</i>

26:01.520 --> 26:05.800
<i>This group of benevolent experts</i>
<i>became the Septaverate.</i>

26:07.200 --> 26:08.960
<i>More representative,</i>

26:09.040 --> 26:10.880
<i>more inclusive.</i>

26:10.960 --> 26:11.840
<i>More</i>

26:12.920 --> 26:13.880
<i>nice.</i>

26:27.360 --> 26:29.640
Here's your peach Bellini,
Mr. Baldwin.

26:29.720 --> 26:30.640
Thank you.

26:32.120 --> 26:36.880
So you can see I had the <i>Face/Off </i>surgery
to look like Rob Lowe.

26:37.520 --> 26:40.120
Did you think
you could get rid of me so easily?

26:42.840 --> 26:43.920
Cheers, mate.

27:41.360 --> 27:43.440
During his distinguished acting career,

27:43.520 --> 27:46.040
there was one role
Mike Myers has always wanted to play,

27:46.120 --> 27:48.120
but fate never gave him that opportunity.

27:48.200 --> 27:52.800
But today, thanks to the magic
of television, his moment is at hand.

27:53.360 --> 27:55.200
Here we are at Queen's Park.

27:55.280 --> 27:57.720
Glenn Cochrane, CFTO News.

27:57.800 --> 27:59.280
-That's my boy!

27:59.360 --> 28:02.000
-Yes, come here! Yes.

28:02.080 --> 28:04.320
-Yay! Yay to Glenn Cochrane.

28:04.400 --> 28:06.560
-Yay!
-Yeah.

28:06.640 --> 28:07.560
Okay.
