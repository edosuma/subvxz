WEBVTT

00:00.667 --> 00:02.067
Very nosy.

00:02.235 --> 00:05.104
<i>[man] What I really like about
camels is their personalities.</i>

00:05.106 --> 00:06.805
<i>[woman] The boy is Matthew.</i>

00:06.807 --> 00:08.774
Matthew is
a tricky camel to work with.

00:08.776 --> 00:10.976
Just be aware. He is a biter.

00:10.978 --> 00:12.778
- Good to know.
- Oh.

00:12.780 --> 00:14.947
- [Jim laughs]
- [woman] Matty!

00:15.014 --> 00:16.749
[woman 2] Hi, nugget!

00:16.751 --> 00:20.686
<i>It has been about ten years, since
we've had a parent raised magellanic chick.</i>

00:20.688 --> 00:23.055
This chick comes across
as kind of a teenager.

00:23.057 --> 00:24.556
<i>Just doesn't want
to deal with me.</i>

00:24.558 --> 00:26.392
Will you please eat something?

00:28.194 --> 00:29.227
You all right, Ivy?

00:29.229 --> 00:31.196
<i>[woman] Babirusa are
threatened in the wild.</i>

00:31.198 --> 00:32.331
<i>[man 2] They're a lot of fun.</i>

00:32.333 --> 00:33.699
- [Babirusa grunts]
<i>- [man 2] They're social.</i>

00:33.701 --> 00:34.967
<i>They want attention.</i>

00:34.969 --> 00:37.770
I have never ultra-sounded
a babirusa before.

00:37.772 --> 00:39.571
Oh, is that a little heartbeat?

00:43.043 --> 00:45.778
<i>[Jim] If you ask a child
to draw a picture of a zoo,</i>

00:45.780 --> 00:49.415
<i>chances are they'll
draw an animal behind bars.</i>

00:49.417 --> 00:52.951
We're just going to take
that image and change it.

00:52.953 --> 00:57.322
<i>[man 3] I really enjoy this. It strengthens
the bond that we have with these guys.</i>

00:57.324 --> 00:58.857
[man 4] Come on. I know,
you don't like doors.

00:58.859 --> 01:01.226
<i>[woman 3] Go on, ladies.</i>

01:01.228 --> 01:03.996
<i>[Jim] It's not enough to keep animals
in exhibits just for people to look at.</i>

01:03.998 --> 01:06.065
<i>There has to be
a higher purpose.</i>

01:06.067 --> 01:09.501
<i>And for us, it's conservation
of species in the wild.</i>

01:09.503 --> 01:10.536
All right.

01:10.538 --> 01:12.104
<i>[Jim] The general public</i>

01:12.106 --> 01:13.872
<i>would never going to get the
access you're going to get...</i>

01:13.874 --> 01:15.707
[woman] It's a girl.

01:15.709 --> 01:19.211
<i>[Jim] which is to see, what goes
on behind the scenes every day.</i>

01:19.213 --> 01:21.146
That's how we do it here
in the boogie down Bronx.

01:21.148 --> 01:23.315
[laughs]

01:35.228 --> 01:38.964
[woman] See. Oh wow!

01:42.302 --> 01:45.104
[Fausto] Hi, boys. Morning.

01:46.372 --> 01:47.506
Hi, Joshua.

01:49.209 --> 01:51.176
Hello, Matthew. I'm gonna
go get your food ready.

01:52.779 --> 01:53.979
Okay.

01:53.981 --> 01:55.414
Grabbing some greens for them,

01:55.416 --> 01:57.549
and I'm going to tip them down
to the viewing area.

01:59.018 --> 02:04.223
<i>I've been working here at the camel
barn for about ten years, going on 11.</i>

02:04.225 --> 02:06.525
<i>And the time we get to spend
with our animals is priceless.</i>

02:08.761 --> 02:10.162
<i>The main part
that I love this job</i>

02:10.164 --> 02:11.897
<i>is that with such large animals</i>

02:11.899 --> 02:13.866
that have
such large personalities.

02:13.868 --> 02:15.067
Hey Luke.

02:15.069 --> 02:16.535
They are really easy
animals to love.

02:16.537 --> 02:18.303
<i>Like they grow on you quickly.</i>

02:21.040 --> 02:22.107
He's ready.

02:23.343 --> 02:25.444
All right, let's go!

02:26.079 --> 02:27.479
[laughs]

02:27.881 --> 02:29.581
Excited.

02:30.783 --> 02:33.418
<i>You tend to think
of a camel as slow and steady.</i>

02:33.420 --> 02:36.455
<i>They can get wild, crazy,
buckle their legs around.</i>

02:39.292 --> 02:40.392
Very nosy.

02:40.394 --> 02:42.194
[laughs]

02:43.062 --> 02:44.463
Nosy boy.

02:45.832 --> 02:47.266
So this is Matthew.

02:47.268 --> 02:49.268
He's around 20 years old now.

02:49.669 --> 02:52.538
<i>Matthew came to the zoo in 2008.</i>

02:52.540 --> 02:55.541
He was, kind of like, a tricky
camel to work with in the beginning

02:55.543 --> 02:58.844
because if he didn't trust you
he would, kind of, nip at you.

02:58.846 --> 03:00.846
<i>But the longer you worked
with him, he gets used to you.</i>

03:00.848 --> 03:02.948
He mellows down.
He trusts you.

03:02.950 --> 03:05.484
And he believes in you,
and then, it's fine.

03:08.888 --> 03:12.724
We've noticed, Matthew has
been having some trouble eating.

03:12.726 --> 03:15.027
We know this
because of the wet lips.

03:15.029 --> 03:16.795
He's not chewing
his cud properly.

03:16.797 --> 03:20.432
<i>And we found some cud balls
around his yard.</i>

03:20.434 --> 03:23.168
<i>They are ruminants. So they
regurgitate their food and they chew it.</i>

03:23.170 --> 03:26.038
<i>So, he wasn't able to chew it
properly so he kept dropping it.</i>

03:26.040 --> 03:28.574
<i>Meaning, he wasn't
digesting food.</i>

03:28.576 --> 03:30.075
<i>And we've noticed that
he looks a little thinner.</i>

03:30.077 --> 03:31.743
Go eat.

03:31.745 --> 03:34.980
The idea that he can't eat
properly is very concerning to me.

03:36.015 --> 03:37.950
<i>We're thinking
that it's a tooth problem.</i>

03:37.952 --> 03:40.185
He might have some points
on his teeth.

03:40.187 --> 03:42.854
<i>And the way that camels chew is,
kind of like, in a figure eight motion.</i>

03:42.856 --> 03:44.089
<i>So, they grind the food.</i>

03:44.091 --> 03:47.226
And if he has points,
he can't grind.

03:47.228 --> 03:49.528
So, then he is spitting up
the food.

03:50.663 --> 03:53.332
We're hoping
to regain some body mass.

03:53.334 --> 03:55.734
Um... through eating some hay,
through some grain,

03:55.736 --> 03:57.903
through whatever treats we
need to give him to fatten him up.

03:57.905 --> 04:01.740
And, Matthew is going to be
scheduled for some dental work,

04:01.742 --> 04:05.244
filing down the points of his
teeth, making them flat again.

04:05.246 --> 04:08.180
<i>With Matthew, new people,
he's very wary about.</i>

04:08.182 --> 04:11.316
<i>You know, they kind of
identify who the vets are, so...</i>

04:11.951 --> 04:12.985
We'll see how that goes.

04:15.188 --> 04:16.355
[grunts]

04:23.763 --> 04:25.264
Oh, that's so cute.

04:27.066 --> 04:30.836
We are right now in between

04:30.838 --> 04:34.640
the lesser adjutant stork exhibit
and this is the Aitken aviary.

04:34.642 --> 04:37.242
And I'm about
to go feed the penguins.

04:38.811 --> 04:41.546
<i>Getting to be out there and
interacting with the penguins</i>

04:41.548 --> 04:43.548
<i>is just
the highlight of the day,</i>

04:43.550 --> 04:45.050
<i>the thing I look forward to.</i>

04:47.987 --> 04:50.022
Hey, mushes. How are you?

04:52.525 --> 04:54.393
Hi, you want some food?

04:56.129 --> 04:58.997
Right now, at the Bronx Zoo, we
have two different species of penguins.

04:58.999 --> 05:01.566
We have little penguins.

05:01.568 --> 05:05.203
<i>And we also have their larger
cousins. The magellanic penguins.</i>

05:06.072 --> 05:07.105
Another one?

05:07.407 --> 05:08.974
Good girl.

05:10.777 --> 05:14.579
You think of a penguin, you think of
ice cold and just barren wilderness,

05:14.581 --> 05:17.949
<i>but most penguins actually
live in more of a mid-range.</i>

05:17.951 --> 05:21.219
<i>So, they live all over the Pacific,
they live south of the equator.</i>

05:22.789 --> 05:25.023
<i>Magellanic penguins
are native to South America.</i>

05:25.025 --> 05:27.559
Come on. There you go.
Good girl.

05:27.561 --> 05:29.394
<i>The are considered,
temperate weather penguins,</i>

05:29.396 --> 05:31.763
which means they can tolerate
all kinds of ranges of temperatures.

05:31.765 --> 05:36.201
So, out here at the Bronx Zoo, they actually
live outside in a really large aviary.

05:37.003 --> 05:39.304
Okay, successful.
Everyone took something.

05:39.939 --> 05:41.406
That was good.

05:43.242 --> 05:48.580
It has been about 10 years since we've
had a parent raised magellanic chick.

05:48.582 --> 05:52.250
<i>We have a pair of penguins. And
they've managed to raise a chick.</i>

05:52.252 --> 05:54.386
That's the baby, that's
downstairs, right now.

05:55.021 --> 05:57.289
We are doing
a blood draw, right?

05:57.291 --> 06:00.325
Can we vaccinate
the magellanic chick, first?

06:00.660 --> 06:02.894
Yeah.

06:02.896 --> 06:06.365
<i>Magellanic penguin chicks
are little tiny gray fluff balls</i>

06:06.367 --> 06:08.333
<i>and they grow very quickly.</i>

06:09.001 --> 06:10.035
Hi, nugget.

06:10.037 --> 06:11.937
How are you?

06:11.939 --> 06:16.341
Our chick right now is 70 days
old. So, just over two months.

06:16.343 --> 06:18.143
<i>So, she's ready
to be an adult now.</i>

06:18.145 --> 06:19.745
Oh, boy.

06:19.747 --> 06:23.181
<i>Right now, the magellanic
penguin chick is in holding</i>

06:23.183 --> 06:25.617
<i>with some of
the other adult birds.</i>

06:25.619 --> 06:26.952
<i>It's actually separated
from its parents,</i>

06:26.954 --> 06:29.821
<i>so that it gets comfortable
eating from the keepers.</i>

06:29.823 --> 06:33.191
We want to make sure that
they are really responding to us.

06:33.193 --> 06:35.193
<i>Because we're going to be
the ones that have to feed them.</i>

06:35.561 --> 06:37.295
Big chunk meister.

06:37.297 --> 06:38.997
It's a beautiful baby.

06:39.799 --> 06:41.700
<i>We give our penguins vaccine,</i>

06:41.702 --> 06:45.003
<i>the same way the humans
would give their children vaccines.</i>

06:45.005 --> 06:48.206
<i>Just to keep them from getting
any diseases, that are in the area.</i>

06:48.208 --> 06:50.375
Okay, little one. I'm sorry.
It's a little pinch.

06:50.377 --> 06:52.110
You've had this before.
It's okay.

06:53.980 --> 06:55.814
Good job.

06:55.816 --> 06:57.949
[vet] Look at all these people.
And maybe, if you slide this way,

06:57.951 --> 07:00.118
I'll have you come in
and help hold the foot.

07:00.586 --> 07:03.855
- Yeah.
- Okay, little one.

07:03.857 --> 07:07.159
<i>For magellanic penguins, the males
are slightly larger than the females.</i>

07:07.161 --> 07:08.927
But there is
a bit of an overlap.

07:08.929 --> 07:10.996
So it's really really
hard to tell.

07:11.831 --> 07:13.565
<i>The vets are going to draw blood</i>

07:13.567 --> 07:18.003
<i>so that we can get the DNA tests to
be certain what the sex of the chick is.</i>

07:21.574 --> 07:24.242
- Just a drop baby, it's just a drop.
- [vet] You keep holding.

07:26.579 --> 07:27.579
We're good, guys.

07:27.581 --> 07:29.848
[Nancy] All right, awesome.

07:29.850 --> 07:31.983
- [vet] He's completely huggable.
- [Nancy] Yes.

07:32.051 --> 07:33.051
[vet] She's cute.

07:33.053 --> 07:35.720
-Or he's cute. We'll know soon.
-[vet laughs]

07:35.722 --> 07:38.890
[Nancy] Okay, you're going
back in. Okay? Thank you.

07:38.892 --> 07:41.626
<i>So, we're going to keep the
magellanic penguin chick inside.</i>

07:41.628 --> 07:43.662
Come on kiddos.

07:43.664 --> 07:48.033
<i>We'll keep working and establishing
our relationship with the chick</i>

07:48.035 --> 07:52.003
<i>and then, in a few weeks, we will be
putting the chick back out on exhibit.</i>

07:53.239 --> 07:54.172
Excuse me, guys.

07:54.174 --> 07:55.941
Scooch over. Thank you.

07:55.943 --> 07:58.376
You'll get the blanket
in a second, okay?

07:59.712 --> 08:02.314
<i>These birds, they're kind of
keeping him company.</i>

08:03.983 --> 08:07.486
Bye, honey. Thank you for
being patient. Thank you, guys.

08:11.324 --> 08:12.924
[children chattering]

08:12.926 --> 08:14.092
[visitor 2] Look at
that big animal.

08:14.159 --> 08:15.393
Say hi.

08:15.395 --> 08:17.128
- Oh, look, look, look.
- [baby cooing]

08:17.130 --> 08:19.397
Kenneth.
Hey boy, how you doing?

08:21.334 --> 08:24.202
This is our are eight-year-old
babirusa, Kenneth.

08:24.737 --> 08:25.970
He's a great pig.

08:25.972 --> 08:28.039
<i>You can go in there with
him, do anything with him.</i>

08:28.041 --> 08:31.009
<i>Loves personal attention.
Like most of them do.</i>

08:32.011 --> 08:34.312
All right, Kenneth,
do you want more peanuts?

08:35.014 --> 08:38.116
<i>Babirusa is
a wild pig from Indonesia.</i>

08:38.118 --> 08:40.619
<i>They're threatened in the wild.</i>

08:40.621 --> 08:45.156
Keeping a healthy population
of babirusa is important.

08:45.158 --> 08:48.260
<i>We have four babirusa
here at the Bronx Zoo.</i>

08:48.262 --> 08:50.962
<i>We have two males
and two females.</i>

08:54.567 --> 08:58.203
I'm preparing breakfast
for our babirusa.

08:59.038 --> 09:02.574
Yams, bananas, grain.

09:02.576 --> 09:05.443
Depending on a particular pig.

09:06.779 --> 09:13.785
Ivy doesn't really like her grain,
unless she has bananas mixed into it.

09:13.787 --> 09:17.088
She likes it customized which
I'm giving a little bit, accordingly.

09:19.091 --> 09:21.293
Okay, here you go, Kiwi.

09:21.295 --> 09:22.861
It's what
you've been waiting for.

09:22.863 --> 09:24.262
All right.

09:25.631 --> 09:27.299
There you go.

09:27.301 --> 09:31.303
This is Kiwi.
She's our 18 year old female.

09:31.571 --> 09:33.038
She's very good.

09:35.107 --> 09:37.242
Hi. This is for Linus.

09:37.510 --> 09:39.310
There's yours.

09:41.981 --> 09:48.253
<i>On the males, the top tusks grow through
on top of their snouts like deer antlers.</i>

09:48.654 --> 09:50.889
Good boy.

09:50.891 --> 09:56.595
I've been working with babirusa
about 13 years and they are a lot of fun.

09:57.563 --> 09:58.997
<i>They are social.</i>

09:59.064 --> 10:02.233
They want attention and
they are very smart as well.

10:03.135 --> 10:05.937
Okay, Ivy. Here you go.

10:05.939 --> 10:09.140
This is our three year old
babirusa, Ivy.

10:10.276 --> 10:12.277
She's been with us
less than a year.

10:12.279 --> 10:15.647
She was very very nervous,
very skittish when she came to us.

10:15.649 --> 10:19.017
And she's warmed up quite a bit.

10:19.019 --> 10:22.020
Ivy came to us through a
breeding recommendation

10:22.022 --> 10:24.456
through the species
survival plan.

10:24.458 --> 10:26.090
<i>So earlier this year,</i>

10:26.092 --> 10:31.563
<i>we did put Ivy together with our
eight year old male babirusa, Kenneth.</i>

10:31.565 --> 10:33.765
And they did exhibit
breeding behavior.

10:33.767 --> 10:36.034
<i>Ivy has never been
pregnant before.</i>

10:36.036 --> 10:39.771
<i>We don't know for sure
if Ivy is pregnant yet.</i>

10:39.773 --> 10:43.708
<i>But we have seen some weight
gain and some teeth development.</i>

10:43.710 --> 10:46.077
<i>Babirusa can have
one or two piglets.</i>

10:46.079 --> 10:47.946
<i>Very very rare occasion, three.</i>

10:47.948 --> 10:51.249
<i>Our hope is to conduct
an ultrasound.</i>

10:51.251 --> 10:55.387
If she is pregnant, that's
going to be a great thing.

10:55.389 --> 10:59.424
It's been a number of years
we've not had piglets born here.

10:59.426 --> 11:01.026
Go out, Ivy.

11:01.994 --> 11:04.129
<i>Babies are always really cool.</i>

11:04.730 --> 11:07.065
Who can resist a little piglet?

11:09.869 --> 11:12.470
[man 6] Better tell psyches,
he's a biter.

11:12.472 --> 11:16.074
Unfortunately as a veterinarian,
most of my patients don't like me.

11:16.175 --> 11:17.008
Oh!

11:17.010 --> 11:18.443
Matthew is no exception.

11:19.378 --> 11:21.379
Oh, the back foot
and everything.

11:26.152 --> 11:28.486
[seal barking]

11:35.161 --> 11:39.230
[vet] This one probably is more useful
than that one, for shaving off points.

11:39.232 --> 11:43.101
<i>[Fausto] We're at the camel barn and we're
getting ready for Matthew's procedure.</i>

11:43.103 --> 11:44.703
It's literally just
filing down his teeth

11:44.705 --> 11:47.372
and making sure that
there are no points.

11:47.374 --> 11:49.174
So that he could be able
to chew his food properly.

11:49.176 --> 11:51.376
- [vet] Good boy.
- [woman] Good boy

11:51.378 --> 11:52.844
- [vet] Oh.
- [woman] Careful.

11:52.846 --> 11:55.246
- [vet] Angry.
- [woman] Good boy, Matty.

11:55.248 --> 11:57.549
I, personally, don't like
going to the dentist.

11:57.783 --> 12:00.552
<i>So, I'm sure Matthew doesn't
want to go to the dentist either.</i>

12:00.786 --> 12:02.153
But, he needs to go.

12:02.755 --> 12:04.622
So, what's happening?

12:04.624 --> 12:06.958
Right now, we're just waiting
'cause he got sedation.

12:06.960 --> 12:08.593
So, we're just waiting for
him to get a little droopy.

12:08.595 --> 12:12.030
And then we can start
working on him.

12:12.032 --> 12:14.833
I spent most of the first eight
years of my career at the zoo,

12:14.835 --> 12:16.634
working with camels.

12:16.636 --> 12:20.638
So, there'll always be some special
connection between me and them.

12:20.640 --> 12:22.507
[woman] You take a wide turn.
There you go.

12:22.509 --> 12:25.143
<i>[Jim] What I really like about
them is their kind of personalities.</i>

12:25.145 --> 12:29.981
You have to work with camels in
order for them to, basically, like you.

12:29.983 --> 12:32.317
[woman] Just be aware.
He is a biter.

12:32.319 --> 12:33.718
[Jim] Good to know.

12:33.720 --> 12:36.387
<i>Ruthy and I, we've both
been here for our entire career.</i>

12:36.389 --> 12:40.358
She is really connected to these
animals and always has been.

12:40.360 --> 12:44.262
He was one of the camels I
worked a lot, so, I know pretty well.

12:44.264 --> 12:46.197
I could rub his ears.

12:46.199 --> 12:48.867
The familiarity that the
people have with the animals

12:48.869 --> 12:51.035
that they work with
and care for at the zoo,

12:51.037 --> 12:54.105
really is the first step in
providing excellent health care

12:54.107 --> 12:57.075
because they're the first to
pick up on subtle changes.

12:57.077 --> 12:59.244
<i>And then the vets can take
the appropriate action,</i>

12:59.246 --> 13:02.514
<i>to make sure small problems
don't become big ones.</i>

13:02.516 --> 13:03.848
[Jim] He's pretty thin.

13:03.850 --> 13:08.052
[Ruth] Yeah, he just lost
some weight, like, rather rapidly.

13:08.054 --> 13:10.889
And this year Jim, his coat
went, I don't know what happened.

13:10.891 --> 13:13.057
He had a bad shed.

13:13.059 --> 13:16.027
[Jim] Did you have a bad shed?
Did you have a bad shed?

13:16.029 --> 13:18.163
- [laughs]
- [Ruth] Matty.

13:18.964 --> 13:21.065
[Jim] We better tell
Sykes he's a biter.

13:22.802 --> 13:26.571
[Ruth] He's very stable still.

13:26.573 --> 13:31.042
We tried for a standing immobilization
in Matthew and it didn't work.

13:31.044 --> 13:34.078
So, now we're going to go
ahead with a full anesthesia.

13:34.080 --> 13:35.814
<i>That'll lay him
all the way down.</i>

13:35.816 --> 13:38.016
Okay, boys, control his head.
See what happens.

13:38.018 --> 13:41.252
Oh. The back foot
and everything.

13:41.254 --> 13:45.824
So, unfortunately, as a veterinarian,
most of my patients don't like me.

13:45.826 --> 13:47.292
<i>Every time I go to see them,</i>

13:47.294 --> 13:49.794
<i>I'm doing something that's
uncomfortable for them.</i>

13:49.796 --> 13:50.728
[Ruth] So, good.

13:50.730 --> 13:52.797
<i>[Dr. John] Matthew is
no exception.</i>

13:52.799 --> 13:54.732
You want to try and lay him
down now? We could do that.

13:54.734 --> 13:56.000
[Ruth] Okay, steady.

13:56.002 --> 13:58.036
- [Jim] Just gotta wait.
- [Dr. John] That's the ketamine.

13:58.038 --> 14:00.572
[Dr. John] It will take
effect, probably fairly quickly.

14:00.806 --> 14:02.240
So, just be aware,
he might fall.

14:02.242 --> 14:03.575
Are you aware?

14:08.447 --> 14:11.516
[Ruth] All right, easy,
easy, easy.

14:12.718 --> 14:16.688
<i>It's hard not to worry about
an animal that's not doing well.</i>

14:16.690 --> 14:19.624
<i>Especially with older camels,
even the smaller procedures.</i>

14:19.626 --> 14:22.026
<i>They are accompanied
with stress for me.</i>

14:22.028 --> 14:25.830
Because I want to make sure
that they get the proper care.

14:25.832 --> 14:27.198
[Jim] Let's see
if we can roll him.

14:27.200 --> 14:28.967
We need a couple more
people under this.

14:28.969 --> 14:31.269
- [Ruth] Yup, yup.
- [Jim] There we go.

14:31.271 --> 14:32.937
<i>[Dr. John] As camels get older
in the wild</i>

14:32.939 --> 14:35.373
<i>and they have problems
with their teeth like this,</i>

14:35.375 --> 14:38.977
they ultimately will die because
they can't chew their food

14:38.979 --> 14:42.480
and they just don't have the
nutrition to sustain themselves.

14:44.350 --> 14:46.150
Hannah, you pull this side.

14:46.152 --> 14:47.385
And I'll pull this side.

14:49.154 --> 14:50.188
Interesting.

14:50.556 --> 14:52.657
[Jim] Were you able to see
how his teeth looked?

14:52.659 --> 14:54.325
[Dr. Robert] There are
some points, Jim.

14:54.327 --> 14:56.961
His right side is definitely
worse than his left.

14:58.130 --> 14:58.863
All right.

14:58.865 --> 15:00.598
You ready folks?

15:03.903 --> 15:08.039
<i>[Dr. John] The traditional way to do
dentistry is with a big long file, by hand.</i>

15:09.241 --> 15:12.610
<i>Luckily, we actually have
a drill that's been modified</i>

15:12.612 --> 15:15.546
<i>to have a grinding disk on it.</i>

15:15.748 --> 15:19.484
<i>And it can speed up the course
of, what we need to do here.</i>

15:24.390 --> 15:26.291
Think I'm pretty much
done up here.

15:26.293 --> 15:29.193
For most part, for an old camel,

15:29.195 --> 15:31.095
the teeth are pretty good.

15:31.097 --> 15:34.632
I was afraid we might find
more disease going on.

15:34.634 --> 15:36.968
Specially with
the difficulty eating.

15:36.970 --> 15:38.770
It could be much worse
than what we're seeing.

15:38.772 --> 15:39.837
[Ruth] That's good.

15:41.674 --> 15:44.075
[Dr. John] You ready?
Gonna give the reversal now.

15:44.077 --> 15:45.977
Well, it turned out all right,
so far.

15:45.979 --> 15:49.814
<i>[Fausto] Now the plan is to
monitor him, and make sure that</i>

15:49.816 --> 15:53.117
<i>he can eat his food properly
and put on some weight.</i>

15:53.119 --> 15:55.820
[Ruth] Good boy.
You did good, buddy.

15:55.822 --> 15:58.957
We're also going to offer him
another supplement like grain

15:58.959 --> 16:01.292
just so that, it's easier
for him to eat and digest.

16:01.927 --> 16:03.027
Itchy nose.

16:03.996 --> 16:04.996
More scratches?

16:04.998 --> 16:06.564
He knows Fausto.

16:14.039 --> 16:15.506
[woman] All set.

16:18.544 --> 16:20.611
- [woman] All set up.
- [woman 2] Okay. Good.

16:20.613 --> 16:21.545
[Phillip] Okay.

16:21.547 --> 16:23.081
I think we'll just leave her
with access

16:23.083 --> 16:24.949
to the yard,
like we usually do it.

16:24.951 --> 16:26.784
So, she's doing it
on her own terms.

16:26.786 --> 16:29.087
So, she doesn't feel like, she's
being shoved into the corner.

16:29.221 --> 16:30.989
[woman] Sounds like a plan.

16:30.991 --> 16:34.158
Okay, let's see if we can
confirm a pregnant pig.

16:34.160 --> 16:37.895
We don't know, for
sure, if Ivy is pregnant yet.

16:37.897 --> 16:39.831
<i>There's a lot of anticipation.</i>

16:39.833 --> 16:43.901
<i>So, we're looking to
conduct an ultrasound on her.</i>

16:43.903 --> 16:45.136
Here, Ivy.

16:45.138 --> 16:46.537
If, Ivy, cooperates with us.

16:47.940 --> 16:49.040
Come, Ivy.

16:52.077 --> 16:53.244
Come.

16:57.916 --> 16:59.083
Come on here, kid.

17:01.320 --> 17:03.254
- Come.
- [woman] She's cute.

17:03.489 --> 17:04.922
Ivy, come.

17:04.924 --> 17:07.025
<i>[Donna] We have a small group
going in there today with her,</i>

17:07.027 --> 17:11.562
because she gets a little
nervous with a lot of people

17:11.830 --> 17:14.198
and a new things
that she's not used to.

17:14.200 --> 17:15.733
Good girl.

17:15.735 --> 17:17.969
But she knows Mary and Phil, so,

17:17.971 --> 17:20.238
hopefully that will
keep her comfortable.

17:20.906 --> 17:21.906
Hi, there mama.

17:21.908 --> 17:23.808
- May I feed her a peanut?
- Yeah.

17:23.810 --> 17:27.812
Boy, is that true? Hi!
Oh, we're friends, huh?

17:27.814 --> 17:31.783
It is very exciting to get to
do an ultrasound on Ivy today.

17:31.785 --> 17:35.019
<i>I have never ultra-sounded
a babirusa before.</i>

17:35.021 --> 17:36.554
Get a little bit
of lube on that.

17:39.258 --> 17:41.192
I am going to be over here.

17:41.727 --> 17:42.893
[vet] It's okay.

17:42.895 --> 17:44.628
<i>[Dr. Donna] This is just like
an ultrasound exam</i>

17:44.630 --> 17:48.533
<i>that a pregnant woman would go through
when you go for your neonatal checkups.</i>

17:48.834 --> 17:50.501
Though pigs are very smart,

17:50.969 --> 17:56.074
you can't explain to them, like you would
a human, that this is for her own good

17:56.076 --> 17:57.909
and this is not going to hurt.

17:57.911 --> 18:01.979
Go back towards midline
just a little bit more.

18:07.252 --> 18:08.519
You guys good?

18:09.154 --> 18:10.955
- So far.
- Good girl.

18:11.423 --> 18:12.523
Getting anxious.

18:12.991 --> 18:14.559
[laughs]

18:14.561 --> 18:16.461
<i>It'd be great if she is pregnant</i>

18:16.463 --> 18:20.164
<i>because we haven't had a baby
babirusa in a number of years.</i>

18:20.166 --> 18:23.201
<i>We were waiting to get a
breeding program going again.</i>

18:24.036 --> 18:25.937
Fingers crossed. [laughs]

18:25.939 --> 18:27.105
You could check this out.

18:27.107 --> 18:29.273
I really don't care
if you check it out.

18:32.945 --> 18:35.980
Oh, I think, I see a spine
right there.

18:37.049 --> 18:39.984
Wonder if you can
twist the probe a little bit.

18:40.419 --> 18:42.120
Oh, is that a little heartbeat?

18:42.821 --> 18:43.754
Seriously.

18:43.822 --> 18:47.024
There's something there.

18:47.026 --> 18:50.962
Let me look at this and see... but it
sure looks like there's a baby in there.

18:51.163 --> 18:52.263
That's cool.

18:57.069 --> 18:58.269
Good girl.

18:59.104 --> 19:00.171
I'll see you in a bit.

19:03.942 --> 19:05.109
Uh.

19:05.711 --> 19:07.211
Uh, look.

19:08.280 --> 19:11.115
See right there? That
sure looks like a baby, right?

19:12.017 --> 19:13.484
A little heartbeat?
Right there?

19:16.021 --> 19:17.255
Congratulations.

19:17.257 --> 19:18.289
[all laugh]

19:18.291 --> 19:19.323
Good job.

19:19.325 --> 19:20.892
At least, one.

19:20.894 --> 19:21.993
No, that's great.

19:21.995 --> 19:23.394
[all laugh]

19:23.396 --> 19:25.196
- I mean, we had the strongest suspicions that was the case.
- Yeah.

19:25.198 --> 19:27.265
But it's nice get some kind
of confirmation

19:27.267 --> 19:29.167
- and erase that little question mark.
- Yeah.

19:29.935 --> 19:30.668
Yay.

19:30.670 --> 19:33.037
Yay, very good.

19:33.039 --> 19:36.174
I'm excited for Ivy.
Only got three-four weeks.

19:36.742 --> 19:38.276
Hopefully, all goes well.

19:38.278 --> 19:40.411
<i>First time mom, first time dad.</i>

19:40.979 --> 19:43.214
There's many aspects to our job.

19:43.216 --> 19:46.384
But, there's none
more rewarding than this.

19:46.952 --> 19:48.152
Now we just wait.

19:50.422 --> 19:52.823
[Nancy] Hi, will you please eat?

19:52.825 --> 19:56.260
<i>We have to train
the new chicks to eat from us</i>

19:56.262 --> 19:58.963
'cause we want to make sure
they're getting enough food everyday.

19:58.965 --> 20:01.065
Please eat something.

20:11.476 --> 20:17.448
I am going to be feeding the
magellanic penguin chick that we have.

20:17.482 --> 20:21.018
<i>Couple of weeks ago, we got a
drop of blood for the veterinarians.</i>

20:21.020 --> 20:24.055
And we sent that off to the lab and
we just found out that she's female.

20:24.256 --> 20:26.023
<i>Her name is Lucy.</i>

20:27.492 --> 20:29.660
<i>Lucy is just over two months.</i>

20:29.662 --> 20:34.865
And in the wild, that's the age where
chicks would be going off into the ocean

20:34.867 --> 20:36.934
and learning
how to hunt for themselves.

20:37.936 --> 20:40.738
Hi, yes. It's fish time.

20:40.740 --> 20:45.343
But in a zoo environment we have
to train the new chicks to eat from us.

20:45.345 --> 20:48.012
<i>So, she is not with parents
at this point.</i>

20:49.214 --> 20:51.182
So, this is a baby.

20:51.984 --> 20:53.217
Will you please eat?

20:53.552 --> 20:55.019
Please eat something?

20:56.888 --> 20:59.123
<i>For this chick right now,</i>

20:59.125 --> 21:01.859
<i>she's really resistant
to eating from me.</i>

21:01.861 --> 21:04.762
And so, it comes across
as being kind of a teenager.

21:04.764 --> 21:06.197
<i>Just doesn't
want to deal with me.</i>

21:08.800 --> 21:12.136
If I get her to eat anything, it's
usually about one fish at a time.

21:14.139 --> 21:16.040
Oh, she's eating!

21:17.009 --> 21:18.309
Hi, another one?

21:18.810 --> 21:20.845
Wonderful.

21:20.847 --> 21:23.247
This is actually very exciting
that she ate two.

21:24.249 --> 21:25.483
Hi, another one?

21:26.184 --> 21:27.418
Hello?

21:28.020 --> 21:29.553
Are you guys done?

21:29.555 --> 21:33.324
So, as you can see, they are kind of
accepting her into the flock over here.

21:33.326 --> 21:36.327
Hopefully, means that when she
goes outside to join the bigger group,

21:36.329 --> 21:38.929
she's going to be just fine.

21:38.931 --> 21:40.898
All right, kiddos,
I'm going to go.

21:40.900 --> 21:45.736
<i>Obviously, I'm really looking forward
to put her out with the other birds.</i>

21:45.738 --> 21:47.938
Right now, we're just waiting
for her to get just a little bit older

21:47.940 --> 21:49.807
so she's a little bit heftier.

21:49.809 --> 21:52.143
Little more consistent
with the food.

21:52.145 --> 21:53.611
I'll see you guys later, okay?

21:53.613 --> 21:55.112
Be good.

21:58.283 --> 22:00.818
[visitor] Look, he's looking
at you. He's saying, "Hello."

22:00.820 --> 22:02.219
Hi.

22:03.555 --> 22:06.090
- [Ruth] We have their attention.
- [Fausto] Yeah.

22:06.092 --> 22:08.059
- [Fausto] Do you want to do it here? Okay.
- [Ruth] There's plenty. Yeah.

22:08.061 --> 22:09.894
That's a good one.

22:09.896 --> 22:13.030
[Fausto] Right now, our
boys are in the viewing area,

22:13.032 --> 22:14.999
- [Ruth] Got it.
- [Fausto] We're cutting some bamboo

22:15.001 --> 22:16.500
just to give them
some enrichment.

22:17.069 --> 22:18.269
[Ruth] Okay good.

22:19.237 --> 22:21.372
Nice. Go get it.

22:22.374 --> 22:24.175
Go and get it, my love.

22:25.110 --> 22:26.711
Hi, Matty.

22:26.713 --> 22:29.880
[Fausto] Matthew got his
teeth filed down last week.

22:29.882 --> 22:32.116
He is keeping his hay down.
And he is eating his grain.

22:32.118 --> 22:34.085
We're going to be separating him

22:34.087 --> 22:36.487
because we want to give
Matthew his supplements

22:36.489 --> 22:38.055
so that he can
put on more weight.

22:38.057 --> 22:41.058
-All right, let's drop a few. They'll take it away.
-All right.

22:41.060 --> 22:42.693
[Ruth] Then we're going
to want to pull Matty.

22:42.695 --> 22:45.096
And we want to have
these guys busy.

22:46.264 --> 22:47.965
<i>[Fausto] Whenever, all
the camels are altogether,</i>

22:47.967 --> 22:49.100
<i>they don't want to be separated.</i>

22:49.102 --> 22:50.368
'Cause they are a family.

22:50.370 --> 22:52.269
[Ruth] Yeah,
they got enough to chew on.

22:52.904 --> 22:54.738
Come on, Matty.

22:55.173 --> 22:58.275
<i>[Fausto] The minute you take someone away,
they're like, why, why is this happening?</i>

22:58.277 --> 22:59.043
<i>What's going on?</i>

22:59.045 --> 23:00.411
[Ruth] Good.

23:00.746 --> 23:02.480
<i>[Fausto] So, we have to make
sure that everyone's happy.</i>

23:02.482 --> 23:05.416
And keep their mind occupied
while Matthew is away.

23:06.885 --> 23:08.219
So, this is Wild Herbivore.

23:08.221 --> 23:11.088
We give Matthew about
two quarts of this a day.

23:11.890 --> 23:13.290
Oh, hi. Sorry to keep you.

23:13.692 --> 23:15.159
Oh, yeah.

23:16.094 --> 23:17.895
[Ruth] They get
very excited for grain.

23:17.897 --> 23:21.532
- He cleans his plate.
- He cleans his plate, yeah.

23:21.534 --> 23:25.803
But if you watch him chewing, it's a
little bit more up and down than typical...

23:25.805 --> 23:27.972
- [Fausto] And, he is still kind of favoring one side.
- [Ruth] Yeah.

23:28.206 --> 23:29.306
He's a little off.

23:31.610 --> 23:33.244
Want to go home?

23:34.913 --> 23:38.849
<i>[Jim] I haven't seen Matthew since
the day the vet filed down his teeth</i>

23:38.851 --> 23:40.985
<i>in a process called floating.</i>

23:42.988 --> 23:44.455
- [Ruth] Hey, Jim.
- [Jim] Hey, Ruth.

23:47.159 --> 23:49.493
- [Ruth] How you doing? Good.
- [Jim] Good, How are you guys?

23:49.694 --> 23:51.796
How is the camel?

23:51.798 --> 23:55.900
[Ruth] We watch his chewing cause it still
feels like a bit up and down sometimes.

23:55.902 --> 23:58.068
[Jim] I was just watching him.
He does move his mouth.

23:58.070 --> 23:59.270
- [Ruth] Yeah.
- [Jim] In a weird fashion.

23:59.272 --> 24:02.239
[Ruth] That little bit
of extra rotation.

24:02.241 --> 24:05.910
[Jim] Yeah, I mean, it's
subtle but it's definitely there.

24:05.912 --> 24:07.978
<i>When you work around
animals a lot,</i>

24:07.980 --> 24:09.747
you pick up
all different indicators

24:09.749 --> 24:12.283
so you can judge
what the animal's mood is,

24:12.285 --> 24:15.319
<i>and when a camel is relaxed,
it just kind of,</i>

24:16.054 --> 24:17.721
calmly just chews its cud

24:17.723 --> 24:20.257
<i>in a really, kind of,
smooth rhythmic fashion.</i>

24:20.259 --> 24:22.960
<i>So, when we watched
Matthew today,</i>

24:22.962 --> 24:26.564
it's just very obvious to us
to anybody who knows camels

24:26.566 --> 24:31.235
that this motion with the lower
jaw is not as smooth as it should be.

24:31.237 --> 24:35.272
<i>He, kind of, has to put a little
extra effort, every once in a while.</i>

24:35.807 --> 24:37.141
<i>I would just like to</i>

24:37.143 --> 24:41.545
<i>ask the vets to come down
with portable x-ray</i>

24:41.680 --> 24:45.382
and see if there's something
that's causing that movement.

24:46.017 --> 24:47.418
It's really great
for these animals

24:47.485 --> 24:49.820
cause when the keepers
notice something,

24:49.822 --> 24:52.189
<i>we can get the vet to come down
and look at any subtle changes</i>

24:52.191 --> 24:53.757
<i>on any of these animals.</i>

24:53.759 --> 24:55.593
<i>And make sure that
the animal is okay.</i>

24:55.595 --> 24:57.995
And if we have to do something
we can move quickly.

24:57.997 --> 25:02.766
Do it early in the process before
small problems become larger ones.

25:02.768 --> 25:06.070
[Ruth] So, I think that'll be the
next step. Just to take a radiograph.

25:06.072 --> 25:09.106
-[Jim] All right. Sure, thank you. Okay.
-[Ruth] I'll keep you posted.

25:14.880 --> 25:15.980
[visitor] See that
giraffe there?

25:15.982 --> 25:17.248
[child] Giraffes!

25:18.917 --> 25:20.117
I'll go put her outside.

25:20.119 --> 25:21.886
Yeah. Hey, kiddo.

25:21.888 --> 25:24.488
How you doing? Good girl.

25:27.626 --> 25:30.094
<i>[Phillip] Our female
babirusa, Ivy,</i>

25:30.096 --> 25:32.763
<i>is a little bit less than five
months pregnant, right now.</i>

25:32.765 --> 25:35.099
She is approximately, two weeks,

25:35.101 --> 25:38.235
away from one week
to be expecting piglets.

25:39.604 --> 25:42.373
<i>We have to set it up</i>

25:42.375 --> 25:46.777
<i>a little differently for her now that
she is getting so close to giving birth.</i>

25:46.779 --> 25:49.179
<i>It's the real thing
coming up pretty soon.</i>

25:52.017 --> 25:53.951
This is like
a maternity set up here.

25:54.352 --> 25:55.486
So, we want to try and provide

25:55.553 --> 25:58.289
as much substrate as
possible, which is wood shavings

25:58.291 --> 26:01.158
<i>as well as, hay for them to,
kind of, hide in.</i>

26:01.793 --> 26:03.327
Little Irish jig.

26:03.962 --> 26:06.964
<i>[Phillip] Ivy, is going to be
a first time mom</i>

26:06.966 --> 26:11.802
<i>which is new to her. So, the
most important thing is privacy.</i>

26:11.804 --> 26:15.139
<i>We need to set things up
to reduce her stress level.</i>

26:15.141 --> 26:16.774
For her to feel comfortable
giving birth

26:16.776 --> 26:19.843
and for the piglets to have
a hiding area

26:19.845 --> 26:23.247
as they are coming into
the world and adjusting.

26:24.983 --> 26:29.720
I've been here. But not as much
as Phil. Phil is like the babirusa man.

26:29.722 --> 26:31.655
Phil is always
in this barn with these guys.

26:31.657 --> 26:33.824
And he's got a really
good relationship with them.

26:33.826 --> 26:36.093
And they feel
really comfortable around him.

26:36.095 --> 26:38.529
<i>He's got
the stuff down to a science.</i>

26:39.731 --> 26:43.834
[Phillip] Lots and lots of
hay. Lots of nesting material.

26:43.836 --> 26:48.772
This is where she'll probably,
actually, give birth.

26:48.774 --> 26:55.045
And this is where the babies will
stay for their first chunk of time in life.

26:56.681 --> 26:58.015
[Jose] This is our bicycle rack.

26:58.017 --> 27:01.986
[Phillip] Yeah. These are for
an extra element of privacy.

27:01.988 --> 27:04.288
[Jose] We'll know
that everything is going well

27:04.656 --> 27:06.056
by watching our cameras.

27:06.058 --> 27:08.859
The little bit that we can see
when they are out of the nest.

27:08.861 --> 27:11.996
But when they are in their nest
and we see a little movement,

27:11.998 --> 27:14.498
we'll just automatically
assume that everything is okay.

27:15.000 --> 27:18.002
It feels cool to be so close.

27:18.004 --> 27:22.873
It's no longer in the distant
future. It's the real thing.

27:22.875 --> 27:28.145
We're pretty well, on our way,
to having what we need.

27:28.947 --> 27:31.415
This is more or less
babirusa nursery.

27:31.417 --> 27:34.718
The day I'm looking forward to
is coming in here in the morning,

27:34.720 --> 27:39.289
looking at the camera monitor, where
we will discover that we have a piglet.

27:41.159 --> 27:43.193
- How do they look so far?
- Pretty blurry.

27:43.195 --> 27:46.463
I'm hoping that Matthew
is going to cooperate with us.

27:47.232 --> 27:49.433
[Ruth] No? He's got to
get a treat.

27:51.069 --> 27:53.237
It's like she's hiding.

27:53.239 --> 27:55.139
I see a little bit of movement
there in the hay.

27:55.774 --> 27:58.008
It's like watching
a baby monitor.

28:03.314 --> 28:05.115
What do you think of the rhinos?

28:12.290 --> 28:14.124
[Phillip] I don't see any pigs.

28:14.659 --> 28:16.393
Looks like she's hiding.

28:17.829 --> 28:20.197
I see a little bit of
movement there in the hay.

28:21.232 --> 28:23.233
There she goes. She
is coming out of the hay.

28:24.769 --> 28:26.403
And there's the debut.

28:30.008 --> 28:32.843
One of my co-workers
discovered the piglet first.

28:32.845 --> 28:37.548
We're being really respectful.
Very minimal interaction.

28:37.749 --> 28:39.149
It's like watching
a baby monitor.

28:39.151 --> 28:41.085
There's our new addition.

28:41.653 --> 28:44.655
It looks good. It's actually
up on its feet.

28:44.657 --> 28:48.258
It's amazing how quick they
get their bearings together.

28:48.260 --> 28:51.328
It was just born. And it's
climbing around in the hay.

28:52.263 --> 28:53.664
And now she's making a tunnel

28:53.666 --> 28:55.999
just for the piglet to go under.

28:56.001 --> 29:00.070
Obviously babirusa in wild
don't have hay nests, like this.

29:00.072 --> 29:04.007
But they'll certainly make
themselves a comfortable spot.

29:04.009 --> 29:06.276
Whether it's
ground cover, leaves.

29:06.511 --> 29:09.079
It's amazing, the instinct.

29:09.081 --> 29:12.983
Because you are talking about a first
time mom and she knows exactly what to do.

29:13.084 --> 29:14.918
It's really cool.

29:14.920 --> 29:19.923
It's been five years since we
had our last babirusa born here.

29:19.925 --> 29:24.027
And now we have to look
forward to raising this baby.

29:24.829 --> 29:26.363
As time goes on,

29:26.365 --> 29:30.334
we're going to start visiting with
her, but that would be baby steps.

29:31.102 --> 29:32.870
So far, so good.

29:32.872 --> 29:35.506
And mom is looking proud.

29:46.918 --> 29:47.684
It's almost time, Matthew.

29:47.686 --> 29:49.953
Going to be a good boy today?

29:49.955 --> 29:53.891
<i>[Fausto] Couple months ago, Matthew,
the camel, got a teeth filing done.</i>

29:53.893 --> 29:55.659
And we've noticed that
even after the filing was done,

29:55.661 --> 29:57.995
he was still chewing
a little bit irregular.

29:57.997 --> 30:02.099
His health and behaviors are
normal, other than the chewing.

30:02.101 --> 30:05.135
Okay, will you toss that in
that spot? And put it like that.

30:06.104 --> 30:07.371
<i>[Fausto] Today,
the vets are here.</i>

30:07.438 --> 30:10.507
We're going to try to get a
voluntary radiograph from Matthew

30:10.509 --> 30:12.776
<i>to see if we can get an image
inside of his mouth.</i>

30:12.778 --> 30:15.546
<i>It's going to give us the
information to move forward.</i>

30:15.548 --> 30:18.081
- [Ruth] Morning, Jim.
- [Jim] Hey, how are you?

30:18.083 --> 30:21.385
- [Jim] Will you do it in his jaw or he comes out here?
- [Ruth] He comes out here.

30:22.520 --> 30:24.021
[Jim] Well, I am anxious to see.

30:24.023 --> 30:25.155
[Ruth] I think, we're ready.

30:25.190 --> 30:26.390
Okay. Ruth.

30:27.358 --> 30:28.859
- [Ruth] Hi, Matthew.
- [Jim] Hello, Matthew.

30:28.861 --> 30:30.427
[Fausto] Hey, Matthew.

30:30.429 --> 30:33.764
Matthew being a camel
that is kind of bitey.

30:33.766 --> 30:37.167
<i>I'm hoping that Matthew
is going to cooperate with us.</i>

30:37.169 --> 30:39.903
<i>We're going to have
the full vet staff here.</i>

30:39.905 --> 30:41.505
<i>We're going to have
the actual equipment.</i>

30:41.507 --> 30:43.040
<i>But we're hoping that</i>

30:43.042 --> 30:47.144
he's unbothered by this because he's
going to be so focused on the treats.

30:47.146 --> 30:49.980
[Ruth] Right, first off, he
has to get a little warmed up.

30:49.982 --> 30:51.415
We've got to check things out.

30:52.550 --> 30:54.084
Go and look at the camera.

30:54.086 --> 30:55.352
All right.

30:56.154 --> 30:57.054
No?

30:57.056 --> 30:59.122
- Got to get a treat.
- [laughs]

30:59.124 --> 31:01.558
[Jim] And how long does he
keep his chin on it?

31:01.726 --> 31:04.628
[vet] We only need to do it for a
couple of seconds for him to click.

31:04.630 --> 31:06.096
[Ruth] He is moving his lips.

31:06.130 --> 31:09.266
- [Jim] How do they look so far? Blurry?
- [vet] Pretty blurry. Yeah.

31:10.068 --> 31:12.903
[Fausto] Matthew just needs
to be still.

31:12.905 --> 31:16.573
Because even a little bit of
motion, will make it blurry.

31:18.543 --> 31:23.247
The whole idea of getting Matthew
to voluntarily cooperate with this

31:23.249 --> 31:26.717
<i>is important because when
you anesthetize any animal,</i>

31:26.719 --> 31:28.886
<i>there's always a risk, but
especially with an older animal.</i>

31:28.888 --> 31:30.954
[vet] Can you get him up
a little bit?

31:30.956 --> 31:33.056
<i>[Jim] When we did
the filing down of his teeth,</i>

31:33.058 --> 31:35.025
he had to be sedated for that

31:35.027 --> 31:36.693
because there's no way he
would have cooperated with that.

31:36.695 --> 31:38.929
That would have been
too much to ask.

31:38.931 --> 31:43.800
<i>But this is basically, asking him to
position his head and holding it still.</i>

31:43.802 --> 31:45.001
<i>It's a simple procedure.</i>

31:45.003 --> 31:47.304
<i>But at the same time,
it needs to be choreographed.</i>

31:47.306 --> 31:49.106
<i>Because there's
a lot of moving parts.</i>

31:49.108 --> 31:50.807
<i>The challenge is kind of</i>

31:50.809 --> 31:53.277
communicating to him
what you want him to do.

31:53.279 --> 31:55.045
[vet] Let me know
when you're ready, Ange.

31:55.047 --> 31:56.013
Ready.

31:56.015 --> 31:57.180
[Ruth] Okay.

32:00.218 --> 32:01.551
We'll distract him.

32:03.121 --> 32:04.221
All good?

32:09.661 --> 32:11.261
All right.

32:12.931 --> 32:16.233
Since, Matthew is most comfortable
with the people he works with everyday...

32:16.235 --> 32:18.402
[Ruth] Hold the tray
closer to his mouth.

32:19.103 --> 32:21.104
[all laugh]

32:21.106 --> 32:23.540
They were the ones who
started the target training,

32:23.542 --> 32:25.809
so to get him to put his head
on the table,

32:25.811 --> 32:29.980
<i>and have him used to something
coming near his head while he is posing.</i>

32:30.548 --> 32:32.115
[Ruth] Good, Mathew.

32:32.117 --> 32:34.885
<i>[Jim] Matthew became more
comfortable when we brought in Dr. More.</i>

32:34.887 --> 32:37.754
<i>So that, Matthew could be
comfortable with them too.</i>

32:37.756 --> 32:38.788
[vet] You know, it would be good

32:38.790 --> 32:40.958
- if he would just stop swaying.
- [Ruth] Yeah.

32:40.960 --> 32:43.493
Some of the things are just
little bit closer to his face maybe,

32:43.495 --> 32:46.863
than he might be
comfortable right now.

32:46.865 --> 32:50.300
<i>Now, he's got a way better
attitude. It's pretty amazing.</i>

32:51.903 --> 32:54.171
Wow. Good boy, Matty.

32:54.173 --> 32:55.439
Cool, right?

32:55.974 --> 32:57.374
He's warming up now.

32:58.676 --> 33:00.811
That's pretty amazing.

33:00.813 --> 33:03.947
<i>These seemingly simple steps
that we can do</i>

33:03.949 --> 33:06.249
to get the animal to cooperate,

33:06.251 --> 33:08.118
so, that there is no stress

33:08.120 --> 33:11.555
in these procedures that we're
doing to better guarantee them

33:11.622 --> 33:14.191
the health, care that they need.

33:14.193 --> 33:16.893
<i>It's kind of the foundation
of what we do.</i>

33:16.895 --> 33:20.063
It took me longer
to learn this than Matthew.

33:22.533 --> 33:25.669
It's the very last molar
that we're looking at.

33:25.671 --> 33:30.974
It does look like there may be
more loss of bone where that tooth is.

33:30.976 --> 33:33.610
Which may just be his body like
you know what, push that tooth out.

33:33.612 --> 33:38.015
Yeah, that's what camels will do,
when they have bad teeth sometimes.

33:38.017 --> 33:43.687
It's not 100% diagnostic. I can't hang
my hat on what I'm seeing necessarily.

33:43.689 --> 33:45.922
But I can look at the images
back at the health center.

33:45.924 --> 33:49.059
I'll get better detail from that
you know, high res monitor.

33:49.761 --> 33:51.028
He's made some good stride.

33:51.462 --> 33:53.897
You look good, Matty, yeah.

33:53.899 --> 33:55.832
- He doesn't wanna end it.
- [all laugh]

33:55.834 --> 33:57.567
Oh, my gosh!

33:57.802 --> 33:59.202
<i>[Fausto] I think
Matthew performed</i>

33:59.404 --> 34:00.470
<i>great today.</i>

34:00.738 --> 34:03.273
<i>Of what he did, what we were
asking him to.</i>

34:03.275 --> 34:05.409
And, I couldn't ask for more.

34:05.411 --> 34:07.544
Good boy, Matthew. Good boy.

34:08.613 --> 34:10.213
Be good, mama.

34:10.548 --> 34:14.084
Lucy, is just over 100 days old, and
she is going out into the Aitken aviary.

34:14.086 --> 34:15.419
Are you going to follow them?

34:16.954 --> 34:20.357
<i>[Phillip] It's a lot of fun,
watching this baby grow up.</i>

34:20.359 --> 34:24.227
It's very important that the piglet
gets used to us being a part of its life.

34:24.229 --> 34:25.829
[woman] Oh, that's cute.

34:25.831 --> 34:27.998
[Phillip] It's my
favorite part of the day.

34:33.137 --> 34:36.506
[visitor] Oh, my God,
look at how adorable they are.

34:40.078 --> 34:41.378
- Hi.
- [man] Hey, guys.

34:41.380 --> 34:43.046
Hey, Lucy.

34:44.182 --> 34:46.450
<i>Lucy is just over
100 days old today.</i>

34:46.452 --> 34:48.185
Hi.

34:48.187 --> 34:51.254
And we are going to be putting her
out on exhibit for the first time today.

34:51.256 --> 34:52.756
Okay, okay.

34:52.758 --> 34:54.524
Lucy is feeling very calm.

34:55.159 --> 34:56.293
She's taking it all in stride.

34:56.295 --> 34:58.161
Big day, mama.

34:58.163 --> 34:59.529
[man] It is a big day.

34:59.531 --> 35:01.264
<i>[Nancy] She is going back in</i>

35:01.266 --> 35:04.134
<i>with two other penguins who have
been keeping her company in holding.</i>

35:05.570 --> 35:06.503
All ready.

35:07.238 --> 35:10.373
Hey, guys. There you go.

35:11.909 --> 35:13.276
She's like, what is this?

35:14.145 --> 35:15.278
[penguin sounds]

35:15.880 --> 35:17.247
[man] Here you go, walker.

35:17.249 --> 35:18.548
[Nancy] Okay, Lucy.

35:19.317 --> 35:20.383
You going to go with them?

35:21.686 --> 35:23.186
[laughs]

35:23.188 --> 35:25.255
Like she has no idea
what's going on right now.

35:26.824 --> 35:28.892
<i>The colony is definitely aware</i>

35:28.894 --> 35:30.994
<i>that there's something going
on. They are on high alert,</i>

35:30.996 --> 35:33.663
<i>They are vocalizing a lot.</i>

35:33.665 --> 35:38.368
It is normal reaction for any
new introduction into the exhibit.

35:38.370 --> 35:42.305
We'll walk around to the public side
and just keep tabs on what's going on.

35:44.041 --> 35:45.509
Okay.

35:47.945 --> 35:51.248
- [man] There's a lot of stimulation going on.
- [Nancy] Yes.

35:52.216 --> 35:54.484
Here we go. She's going in.
I think she is following.

35:55.186 --> 35:56.286
There we go.

35:57.889 --> 35:59.689
<i>The two that she was with</i>

35:59.691 --> 36:01.558
<i>in for the quarantine,
she is following them around.</i>

36:01.560 --> 36:03.927
<i>So, she's going to see,
you know, what they do.</i>

36:03.929 --> 36:07.898
Around the other birds, I think
she will cue in on that really quickly.

36:07.900 --> 36:09.900
- Oh, she's coming out.
- [man] There you go, she's coming out.

36:09.902 --> 36:12.302
[Nancy] Yeah. Awesome.

36:12.304 --> 36:15.972
Now she's going to wander
around and look at everyone.

36:15.974 --> 36:17.373
This is good.

36:17.375 --> 36:20.644
<i>I see that Lucy is interacting
with all the other birds.</i>

36:20.646 --> 36:24.181
<i>She's on the island
with everyone.</i>

36:24.183 --> 36:26.183
She's on the right track.
She's doing really well.

36:28.219 --> 36:29.586
She's finally walking around.

36:30.454 --> 36:33.757
I've been working with magellanic
penguins for about 25 years now.

36:33.759 --> 36:38.061
<i>It's really satisfying to be able to
get to a point where we have a chick</i>

36:38.063 --> 36:41.565
<i>that's out on exhibit,
because it really is hard work</i>

36:41.567 --> 36:44.534
<i>raising the chick and
making sure she was healthy.</i>

36:44.536 --> 36:46.203
<i>Making sure
she is eating from us.</i>

36:46.205 --> 36:49.039
All of those things play
into being able to put her out.

36:49.041 --> 36:51.808
<i>So, it's really
a sense of accomplishment</i>

36:51.810 --> 36:54.611
<i>for us, she is actually
doing normal penguin stuff,</i>

36:54.613 --> 36:57.047
<i>and she gets to
enjoy her big exhibit.</i>

36:57.049 --> 37:01.918
<i>I really just hope that Lucy grows
into a very calm, very chill adult.</i>

37:01.920 --> 37:05.121
And may be, she'll have a
bunch of little chill babies.

37:05.123 --> 37:07.090
<i>[laughs] And down the road,</i>

37:07.092 --> 37:08.925
<i>we'll have a few chicks from her</i>

37:08.927 --> 37:10.293
<i>and we'll see what happens.</i>

37:11.529 --> 37:14.264
- And this is going to be the most awkward splash ever.
- [man] Yeah.

37:14.266 --> 37:17.300
-Yeah, this looks better. [laughs]
-[man 2] Just as we thought.

37:17.302 --> 37:18.468
[Nancy] Yeah.

37:28.713 --> 37:31.214
[Phillip] We're going over
to our babirusa barn,

37:31.216 --> 37:35.218
to say hi to Ivy and her piglet.

37:36.354 --> 37:38.021
It's my favorite part
of the day.

37:38.889 --> 37:39.990
[Colleen] Hi.

37:40.057 --> 37:41.992
- [Phillip] How you doing, piglet?
- [Colleen laughs]

37:41.994 --> 37:43.627
- Hey, Ivy.
- [Colleen] Aw, that's cute.

37:43.629 --> 37:46.196
- Getting big too.
- [Phillip] How you doing?

37:47.098 --> 37:50.200
<i>Right now,
our piglet is two months old.</i>

37:50.202 --> 37:52.068
We now know,
that the piglet is a male.

37:52.070 --> 37:55.438
And we named him Sprout.

37:55.440 --> 37:58.742
<i>It's doing great.
Mom is being a great mom.</i>

37:58.744 --> 38:02.312
<i>And we're at the point where
we can build a relationship.</i>

38:02.314 --> 38:05.949
Very important that the piglet gets
used to us being a part of its life.

38:06.584 --> 38:07.817
[Colleen] Hi, little one.

38:07.819 --> 38:10.020
- [Phillip] Look good.
- [Colleen] No problem eating.

38:10.022 --> 38:12.188
[Phillip] This one
is a crazy eater.

38:12.190 --> 38:14.858
<i>Loves his treats,
grapes, peanuts.</i>

38:14.860 --> 38:16.893
<i>A little bit of everything.</i>

38:16.895 --> 38:20.730
<i>The name, Sprout, it
matches perfectly the fact that</i>

38:20.732 --> 38:25.235
we got a fast grower here. And
her is going to continue to sprout.

38:25.237 --> 38:27.537
[Colleen] I have to say,
feeling really calm.

38:27.539 --> 38:30.173
He looks quiet at ease.
I like it.

38:30.175 --> 38:33.643
- [Phillip] Yeah.
- But you've slowly gotten her used to being around.

38:33.645 --> 38:36.713
Noises of other keepers,
other managers.

38:36.715 --> 38:39.149
[Phillip] You are a good mom.
You're a really good mom.

38:42.086 --> 38:44.154
<i>The kid has gotten
more independent</i>

38:44.156 --> 38:47.057
and it's developed
a confident attitude.

38:47.059 --> 38:50.193
<i>It's a lot of fun watching
this baby grow up.</i>

38:50.895 --> 38:52.295
[Colleen] Go on, little one.

38:53.698 --> 38:55.231
[Phillip] And this is good too.

38:55.233 --> 38:58.301
Ivy, going on one side.
Piglet going on the other side.

38:58.303 --> 39:00.303
[Colleen] Right, getting
really comfortable here.

39:00.638 --> 39:02.672
It's wonderful.

39:02.674 --> 39:06.743
<i>We have a very long history of
having babirusa, here, at the Bronx Zoo.</i>

39:06.745 --> 39:09.913
Our first breeding pair
came in 1985.

39:09.915 --> 39:12.615
And then in 1986,
we saw our first birth.

39:12.617 --> 39:14.884
<i>So, since 1986 to today,</i>

39:14.886 --> 39:19.155
with Ivy's new offspring here
we have produced, 32 offspring.

39:20.024 --> 39:21.758
<i>This piglet
is really important for us</i>

39:21.760 --> 39:24.761
<i>because babirusa
are threatened in the wild.</i>

39:24.763 --> 39:28.498
There are, perhaps,
less than 10,000 of them left.

39:28.500 --> 39:33.069
<i>So, all efforts for conservation
must be reinforced.</i>

39:33.071 --> 39:37.741
<i>It's been really exciting to be able to
set up a breeding program again here.</i>

39:37.743 --> 39:40.410
<i>Ivy is turning out to be
a really good mom</i>

39:40.412 --> 39:43.213
<i>which means she will have
many more piglets in her future.</i>

39:43.215 --> 39:45.148
[Phillip] I can't wait till
the piglet gets big enough so

39:45.150 --> 39:47.917
that we can take this
baby proofing off

39:47.919 --> 39:50.019
and be a little more
personable there.

39:50.021 --> 39:53.957
[Colleen] Well, if it keeps growing
this way, it'll be before you know it.

39:55.159 --> 39:58.928
[Fausto] Matthew's previous
weight was 1,385 pounds.

39:58.930 --> 40:00.997
<i>Today we're hoping to see
it a little higher.</i>

40:00.999 --> 40:02.132
[Ruth] Fairly big.

40:11.008 --> 40:12.175
[Fausto] Take
the measuring tape.

40:14.311 --> 40:16.212
[Ruth] Hello, Matthew.

40:16.547 --> 40:17.947
Hi, hon.

40:17.949 --> 40:19.215
Today, we're going
to be weighing Matthew.

40:19.217 --> 40:21.117
We don't have a scale
here at the barn.

40:21.119 --> 40:22.852
But we do have measuring tape.

40:22.854 --> 40:24.854
So, we'll take measurements
of his body,

40:24.856 --> 40:27.390
put it into a formula and
we get an estimated weight.

40:27.792 --> 40:28.958
[Ruth] Good boy.

40:29.727 --> 40:31.461
[Fausto] So, we take
measurement of his height,

40:31.463 --> 40:33.329
which is
the shoulder to the floor.

40:33.931 --> 40:35.665
So, 195.

40:35.667 --> 40:37.100
Then we take measurement
of his circumferences

40:37.102 --> 40:39.436
of his shoulder around
his pedestal.

40:40.004 --> 40:40.937
[Ruth] Steady, babe.

40:40.939 --> 40:42.772
- [Mathew grunts]
- [Ruth laughs]

40:42.774 --> 40:45.041
- [Fausto] 228.
- [Ruth] Good baby boy.

40:45.043 --> 40:49.145
<i>[Phillip] Matthew's previous
weight was 1,385 pounds.</i>

40:49.147 --> 40:52.081
Today, we're hoping to either
see the same or a little bit higher.

40:52.083 --> 40:54.951
That gives us, 1,391 pounds.

40:54.953 --> 40:57.554
So, according to the estimated
weight, he did go up.

40:57.556 --> 41:01.057
- [Ruth] Okay. Good.
- [Phillip] So, it's great.

41:01.059 --> 41:04.861
<i>[Jim] Since Matthew had his teeth filed
down, he's had a lot easier time eating.</i>

41:04.863 --> 41:07.063
He's actually gaining weight,
his condition is improving.

41:07.065 --> 41:09.466
So, even though
the radiograph showed

41:09.468 --> 41:11.868
<i>that he may have issues
with one of those teeth,</i>

41:11.870 --> 41:14.938
<i>we're hoping that
it'll resolve itself.</i>

41:14.940 --> 41:17.006
[Fausto] He's so ready to train
right now. He's just watching us.

41:17.008 --> 41:18.441
- [Fausto laughs]
- [Ruth] Yeah.

41:18.943 --> 41:20.944
<i>[Jim] The people that work
him everyday,</i>

41:20.946 --> 41:23.947
<i>They're going to make sure he's
doing okay. Follow his progress.</i>

41:23.949 --> 41:27.217
And he's a strong animal. And he's
going to come through this just fine.

41:28.085 --> 41:29.219
[Fausto] Hold.

41:30.087 --> 41:32.789
- Good boy.
- [Ruth] Really good.

41:32.791 --> 41:37.427
I am impressed with the progress we've
made with Matthew and his cooperation.

41:38.295 --> 41:39.462
- Very good hold.
- [Fausto] Great.

41:40.331 --> 41:41.397
[Ruth] Amazing.
