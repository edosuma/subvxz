last week in New Orleans
is sick now.

19:13.326 --> 19:14.936
Fever, deep cough.

She's waiting
on COVID test results.

19:16.590 --> 19:17.982
Thought I should tell you

19:18.026 --> 19:19.636
since we were
in the same room together.

19:19.680 --> 19:21.247
Oh, wow.

19:21.290 --> 19:22.726
Thank you for that.
I appreciate it.

19:22.770 --> 19:24.380
They're keeping a pretty
close eye on us over here.

19:24.424 --> 19:26.513
Trust me.
But I'll stay careful.

19:26.556 --> 19:27.992
Are you okay? You're not
feeling sick, are you?

19:28.036 --> 19:29.646
No, not at all.

19:29.690 --> 19:31.692
But I'm gonna quarantine
for a while just to be safe.

19:31.735 --> 19:33.433
I'm sorry to hear that.

19:33.476 --> 19:35.261
What are you gonna do
about tonight?

19:35.304 --> 19:36.958
Who's gonna drop off the food
for the folks stuck inside?

19:37.001 --> 19:38.394
Well, everyone's gonna get
their meals.

19:38.438 --> 19:39.656
Just might not be tonight.

19:39.700 --> 19:41.528
Why don't you let me
handle that?

19:41.571 --> 19:42.920
You already have so much
going on with work.

19:42.964 --> 19:44.444
If I have to work,

19:44.487 --> 19:45.836
I'll just get somebody else

19:45.880 --> 19:47.316

to help out.

her for coronavirus.

20:13.734 --> 20:15.431

she needs stitches.

20:15.475 --> 20:16.867

20:16.911 --> 20:18.434
Wow. I'm so sorry.

20:18.478 --> 20:20.306

to catch the guy.

20:20.349 --> 20:21.698

20:21.742 --> 20:22.917
No, she won't
press charges,

20:22.960 --> 20:24.571
so they're not even
looking for him.

20:24.614 --> 20:26.442
I called in a favor with
a buddy in video forensics.

20:26.486 --> 20:28.531
I'll find him, make sure
he knows what's what.

20:28.575 --> 20:29.880
Hey, I get it, I do,
but just try

20:29.924 --> 20:32.013

on this, all right?

20:32.056 --> 20:33.710
That's easy for you to say.
It wasn't your mom.

20:33.754 --> 20:36.017

Well, I guess I've always
just been a risk-taker,

22:14.637 --> 22:17.466

a risk worth taking.

What's the word from the CIA?

23:21.835 --> 23:23.880
Well,
Prebble thinks it's promising.

23:23.924 --> 23:26.056
Unis are chasing down the
owner of the storage facility

23:26.100 --> 23:28.581

Sir, Rob Ulmer died in '88.

Come on, Commander.
You think Salman Radek

23:37.938 --> 23:39.809
is really hanging out
in storage lockers?

23:39.853 --> 23:41.724
I guess his travel plans
could have changed

23:41.768 --> 23:44.074
when flights shut down,
left him in between hideouts.

23:44.118 --> 23:46.076
We don't even know yet
why he'd be in L.A.

I just can't see him crashing on
the floor of a storage locker.

30:15.509 --> 30:16.902
[gunfire over TV]

30:16.945 --> 30:19.121
Okay. I just lost.

30:25.649 --> 30:27.608
Kid replied.Keep him talking, Tan.

30:46.409 --> 30:49.325
All right, I sent it.All right, let's get the drone
in position.

30:49.369 --> 30:50.849
Roger that.

30:56.028 --> 30:57.464
All right, he's in the room.

30:57.507 --> 30:59.248
The man still appears
to be sleeping. Are you ready?

31:00.467 --> 31:02.861
Good to go.

31:11.173 --> 31:13.567
[camera shutter clicking]

31:16.004 --> 31:17.484
Photo should be processing now,
Commander.

31:23.316 --> 31:24.578
We got him.

31:24.621 --> 31:25.622
Yeah.

31:29.365 --> 31:31.715
Before we go in, I'm
sorry for losing my cool.

31:31.759 --> 31:33.456
Okay, but you keep
your focus, Street.

31:33.500 --> 31:35.023
The real work
hasn't started yet.

31:35.067 --> 31:36.242
Chris, you good?

31:36.285 --> 31:37.939
Ready when you are.All right, listen up.

31:37.983 --> 31:40.420
We got five armed adult males
and one child at risk inside.

31:40.463 --> 31:42.596
We think Radek's
in the back room, east side.

31:42.639 --> 31:43.597
Now we're taking them by
surprise, so I need

31:43.640 --> 31:45.164
every access point covered.

31:45.207 --> 31:46.905
Everyone clear on their orders?Clear.
Clear.

31:47.644 --> 31:48.645
I'm clear.

31:48.689 --> 31:50.299
I know.

31:50.343 --> 31:52.258
Let's go.

31:54.651 --> 31:57.350
20-David to all perimeter units.
Let me know when you're set.

31:57.393 --> 32:00.179
24-David and 26-David set.On my command.

32:00.222 --> 32:01.441
Three, two,

32:01.484 --> 32:02.964
one.

32:05.184 --> 32:06.315
LAPD!

32:06.359 --> 32:07.403
We got the house surrounded!

32:14.628 --> 32:16.151
Armed suspect just ran
out of the house.

32:16.195 --> 32:17.544
Three-side, heading south.

32:17.587 --> 32:19.241
I'm on it.

32:21.591 --> 32:23.463
Police! Put the weapon down!

32:27.423 --> 32:29.164
[gunshot]

32:31.036 --> 32:34.169
Out in the hallway!
Step out slowly!

32:34.213 --> 32:36.650
Hands where I can see
them. On your knees!

32:36.693 --> 32:38.652
Get on your knees!

32:38.695 --> 32:40.697
Hands behind your head.

32:42.482 --> 32:43.657
Where's Radek?

32:51.317 --> 32:53.319
Mischa, wait.

33:06.419 --> 33:09.117
Hey. I'm a
policeman.

33:09.161 --> 33:11.380
Run outside to the yard.
Come on. You'll be safe there.

33:12.512 --> 33:16.255
MAILMAN:
Mischa. Hey.

33:16.298 --> 33:17.386
Hey. Come. Come here.

33:17.430 --> 33:18.692
Daddy wants to
talk to you.

33:20.172 --> 33:21.521
These men want to hurt us.

33:22.826 --> 33:24.741
Come on.

33:24.785 --> 33:26.395
[shouts]Down on the ground!

33:26.439 --> 33:27.744
Drop the weapon! Do not move!

33:27.788 --> 33:29.311
Show me your hands!

33:30.573 --> 33:32.314
Get outside, kid. Go!

33:40.844 --> 33:44.152
LAPD. Hands
above your head.

33:44.196 --> 33:45.197
Turn around.

33:47.590 --> 33:48.809
On your knees.

33:48.852 --> 33:51.594
Hands behind your head.

33:54.554 --> 33:55.642
[camera clicks]

33:58.601 --> 34:02.083
Chris, I got two guys zip-tied
in the south hall.

34:02.127 --> 34:04.607
We've got our target.
It's Radek.

34:04.651 --> 34:06.044
Good job, Deac. Well done.

34:07.480 --> 34:09.482
Great work.

34:09.525 --> 34:11.353
Well, I told you
they were the best.

34:11.397 --> 34:13.616
HONDO:
Photo's uploading, Commander.

34:18.491 --> 34:19.882
That's a look-alike.

34:19.927 --> 34:22.234
That's not Salman Radek.

34:34.898 --> 34:38.598
Radek's got to be somewhere
on this side of the house.

34:38.641 --> 34:41.253
Tan, switch the eyes in the sky
back into thermal.

34:41.295 --> 34:43.081
Roger that.

34:45.431 --> 34:47.824
There's someone moving your way
from inside the house, Hondo.

34:47.868 --> 34:50.130
He's just on the other side
of your wall.Is he headed east?

34:50.175 --> 34:52.306
No, he's moving exactly parallel
to you and he's got a gun.

34:52.351 --> 34:54.222
Well, one man down,
it must be Radek.

34:54.266 --> 34:55.614
How close is he to the door?

34:56.659 --> 34:57.791
TAN:
Five seconds.

34:59.793 --> 35:03.405
Three, two, one.

35:04.711 --> 35:06.191
Stay down.

35:06.234 --> 35:09.194
Stay down! Target
apprehended.

35:09.237 --> 35:11.805
Repeat: Radek in custody.

35:15.809 --> 35:17.680
Looks like Radek's
wedding is off.

35:17.724 --> 35:19.378
According to one of his men,
they were supposed

35:19.421 --> 35:21.945
to leave together a few days
ago, but he got spooked

35:21.989 --> 35:24.513
when travel was shut down and
figured he'd try to wait it out.

35:24.557 --> 35:27.168
That's the social worker
assigned to help the kid.

35:27.212 --> 35:28.430
She said he came here
from Chechnya

35:28.474 --> 35:29.910
three years ago
after his mom died.

35:29.953 --> 35:32.478
Molly said she'll try
to pull some strings.

35:32.521 --> 35:34.262
We know some great homes
that'll help keep him on track.

35:34.306 --> 35:36.308
That's-that's cool of her.

35:36.351 --> 35:38.658
Hey, uh, Molly and
I were talking,

35:38.701 --> 35:41.443
and the news is saying
as long as your friends follow

35:41.487 --> 35:43.445
the guidelines,
people can still hang out.

35:43.489 --> 35:44.968
Like, in a pod.

35:45.012 --> 35:46.796
Sounds more like coffee
than a real plan.

35:46.840 --> 35:49.408
Yeah, I know, but, uh,
if you're ever down,

35:49.451 --> 35:51.540
I'd love to
have you over.Maybe next time.

35:51.584 --> 35:53.586
See you tomorrow.
Cool.

35:54.848 --> 35:57.155
See you then.

36:03.291 --> 36:04.945
You Oliver Davis?

36:04.988 --> 36:06.686
I got a question
for you.

36:06.729 --> 36:08.731
If you think you'll get COVID
from an Asian American

36:08.775 --> 36:10.429
who's lived
in the U.S. for 30 years,

36:10.472 --> 36:11.865
why not leave her alone?

36:11.908 --> 36:13.258
Who are you?

36:13.301 --> 36:15.303
The son of the woman
you attacked outside the market.

36:15.347 --> 36:16.391
What woman?

36:16.435 --> 36:17.697
Her name's Fei.

36:17.740 --> 36:19.438
She was born in China,

36:19.481 --> 36:21.614
but she loves this country
and she's given it everything,

36:21.657 --> 36:23.572
including two sons:
a doctor and a cop.

36:23.616 --> 36:25.400
What have you done, huh?
Besides taunt people

36:25.444 --> 36:26.575
who don't look
like you?

36:26.619 --> 36:28.316
Give an old woman stitches?

36:28.360 --> 36:30.536
We got video
of what you did.

36:30.579 --> 36:32.712
Even worse for you, I'm the cop.

36:32.755 --> 36:33.843
I didn't do anything.

36:33.887 --> 36:34.975
She tripped.

36:35.018 --> 36:36.498
Yeah, there you go.
Now you remember.

36:36.542 --> 36:38.718
Hey, stay right there,
ma'am. LAPD.

36:38.761 --> 36:40.328
What'd my brother do?

36:40.372 --> 36:41.938
Doesn't concern you.

36:41.982 --> 36:43.026
He's sick, you know.

36:43.070 --> 36:44.463
Don't play the virus card.

36:44.506 --> 36:45.812
I didn't mean for her to fall.

36:45.855 --> 36:47.509
You can't arrest me.

36:47.553 --> 36:49.250
Oliver, whatever you did,
I don't have cash

36:49.294 --> 36:50.860
until next week
to bail you out.

36:50.904 --> 36:52.949
So you might have to be
in jail over the weekend.

36:52.993 --> 36:55.865
He was in a motorcycle accident
18 years ago

36:55.909 --> 36:57.519
and he's never been...

36:57.563 --> 36:59.042
He's mentally ill.

36:59.086 --> 37:01.697
Hey, look, I know
about mental illness.

37:01.741 --> 37:03.264
I also know
what your brother said

37:03.308 --> 37:05.397
to my mom didn't
come out of nowhere.

37:07.790 --> 37:09.618
He may not have the mental
capacity to know better,

37:09.662 --> 37:10.880
but you do.

37:12.317 --> 37:13.535
[quietly]:
Go.

37:15.581 --> 37:17.800
So what kind of crap
are you saying around him?

37:26.418 --> 37:27.636
Hey, Commander,
what are you doing here?

37:27.680 --> 37:29.856
Well, you seemed pretty
upset when you left.

37:30.813 --> 37:33.555
Deacon filled me in
on what happened with your mom.

37:34.774 --> 37:36.079
Think I was gonna
do something stupid?

37:36.123 --> 37:37.994
Never crossed my mind.

37:38.038 --> 37:39.953
But I thought maybe

37:39.996 --> 37:43.304
if you did do something stupid,
I'd come by and stop you.

37:48.483 --> 37:50.616
ANNIE [over phone]:
I told her it wasn't easy
for Matthew to concentrate

37:50.659 --> 37:53.793
with 15 other kids
on the screen, and...

37:53.836 --> 37:55.403
you know, I can't look after him
the whole time.

37:55.447 --> 37:56.622
So... Hold on.LILA: Mommy!

37:56.665 --> 37:58.493
I'm waiting!Hey, honey?

37:58.537 --> 38:00.669
I told you we need
some Mom and Dad time, okay?

38:00.713 --> 38:02.323
Annie, it's okay.

38:02.367 --> 38:03.542
If you got to go handle it,
we'll talk later.

38:03.585 --> 38:04.673
You sure? I'm...

38:04.717 --> 38:06.327
I'm sorry.No, no. No problem.

38:06.371 --> 38:08.111
Just give me a call at bedtime,
all right?

38:08.155 --> 38:10.636
I promised Lila we'd get to
chapter nine of Charlotte's Web.

38:10.679 --> 38:13.639
Okay. We all miss you so much.

38:13.682 --> 38:15.684
Miss you, too.

38:15.728 --> 38:17.382
Love you guys.

38:17.425 --> 38:19.471
Love you, too.

38:21.821 --> 38:23.475
[sighs]

38:25.868 --> 38:27.870
[phone ringing]

38:34.834 --> 38:36.618
Hey, Nichelle.

38:36.662 --> 38:37.924
Oh, you're already there.

38:37.967 --> 38:39.578
I was hoping to catch you
before you...

38:39.621 --> 38:41.667
Is everything all right?My friend in New Orleans,

38:41.710 --> 38:42.972
her test came back negative,

38:43.016 --> 38:44.670
so I don't have to quarantine
after all.

38:44.713 --> 38:48.456
I can cover tonight, so please
go, enjoy your time off.

38:48.500 --> 38:49.588
And thank you so much.

38:49.631 --> 38:51.111
Nichelle, that's great news.

38:51.154 --> 38:52.982
Sorry you went all the way
over there.

38:53.026 --> 38:54.157
No, come on, don't be.

38:54.201 --> 38:55.985
I actually got
a lot done already,

38:56.029 --> 38:58.466
so I'll lock up
before you get here.

38:58.510 --> 39:01.600
Um, hey, uh,
do you have a minute?

39:01.643 --> 39:04.733
Um, there's something
I really need to say to you,

39:04.777 --> 39:07.606
and I'm just glad
that I can see your face.

39:07.649 --> 39:08.998
Sure. You okay?

39:09.042 --> 39:10.826
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I'm okay.

39:12.524 --> 39:16.832
Yeah, I'm okay, I just, um...
I wasn't.

39:16.876 --> 39:21.663
Um, before you left, you said me
and you want different things.

39:21.707 --> 39:24.884
And... I get why you said that.

39:24.927 --> 39:26.059
I do.

39:27.452 --> 39:29.410
It's just, you know,
it-it ain't easy

39:29.454 --> 39:32.631
when someone holds a mirror up
to your face and...

39:32.674 --> 39:34.981
you don't see the man
that you want to be.

39:37.244 --> 39:39.072
Look, Nichelle,
when I was a kid, you know,

39:39.115 --> 39:41.030
I'd see married couples
holding hands,

39:41.074 --> 39:43.076
you know,
laughing together and...

39:43.119 --> 39:46.993
But I was always just like,
"Damn," you know, "My parents...

39:47.036 --> 39:48.690
[laughs softly]

39:48.734 --> 39:52.085
...they just,
they got it wrong."

39:52.128 --> 39:56.524
And I think fear of repeating
their mistakes,

39:56.568 --> 39:59.222
it messed me and my sister's
head up for 30 years.

39:59.266 --> 40:01.442
You know?

40:01.486 --> 40:04.445
But for me, all that time,
I mean,

40:04.489 --> 40:06.926
I guess I just felt that the
rest of my life was moving along

40:06.969 --> 40:10.930
well enough that I didn't
really see it as a problem.

40:12.932 --> 40:14.934
Until I lost you.

40:16.501 --> 40:17.589
[exhales]
Listen, Hondo...

40:17.632 --> 40:18.938
No, no, no. Seriously.

40:18.981 --> 40:22.071
You don't have to say anything.

40:22.115 --> 40:23.899
I know it's too late, and...

40:25.727 --> 40:28.469
...and you've met someone else.

40:28.513 --> 40:30.166
I ain't gonna lie,
I really wish you hadn't,

40:30.210 --> 40:33.431
but... you did.

40:36.782 --> 40:38.261
I just want to tell you
I'm sorry.

40:38.305 --> 40:41.264
I'm-I'm sorry for being so
afraid when we were together,

40:41.308 --> 40:43.179
and letting you down
with your parents,

40:43.223 --> 40:46.618
because I know
I hurt you and I am sorry.

40:49.142 --> 40:51.274
The time that I had
with you, it...

40:51.318 --> 40:53.276
it changed how I look at life.

40:53.320 --> 40:57.455
It... It changed
what I want for myself.

41:00.719 --> 41:04.723
What I'm trying to say to you is

41:04.766 --> 41:07.116
because of you
holding me accountable,

41:07.160 --> 41:09.989
I'm actually at a better place
in my life than I was,

41:10.032 --> 41:14.036
and... I just want
to thank you for that.

41:15.037 --> 41:16.604
So...

41:20.042 --> 41:22.741
Good night, Nichelle.

41:24.264 --> 41:26.266
Good night, Hondo.
