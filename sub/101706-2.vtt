Previously onSWAT...STREET: Almost every SWAT op

00:10.140 --> 00:11.663
would be the scariest day

00:11.707 --> 00:13.448
of most people's lives.

00:13.491 --> 00:15.058
We're not most people.

00:15.102 --> 00:16.799
You and me, we already
experienced our worst day.

00:16.842 --> 00:17.800
When we were kids.

00:17.843 --> 00:19.149
Can't argue that.

00:19.193 --> 00:20.455
That kiss...

00:20.498 --> 00:21.717
The mutual moment that we had?

00:21.760 --> 00:24.285
We're teammates.
That's all.

00:24.328 --> 00:26.156
Is Jim Street single?

00:26.200 --> 00:28.637
I-I think you guys
would be great together.

00:28.680 --> 00:30.334
I'm not gonna be able
to make it tonight.

00:30.378 --> 00:32.075
This is important, Hondo.

00:32.119 --> 00:34.164
Your friends are gonna be there
and-and your folks.

00:34.208 --> 00:36.471
I understand.

00:36.514 --> 00:37.994
Nichelle, I am so sorry

00:38.038 --> 00:39.735
about the way I handled things
the last time I saw you.

00:39.778 --> 00:42.346
NICHELLE:
I'm not upset, Hondo.

00:42.390 --> 00:45.219
It just clarified things.

00:47.221 --> 00:48.831
Masks now?
From the virus?

00:48.874 --> 00:51.225
Recommendations and protocols
keep changing.

00:51.268 --> 00:52.791
We're still getting info
for it.

00:52.835 --> 00:54.663
It's coronavirus. Mayor's been
on the phone with the CDC

00:54.706 --> 00:57.100
and the governor; she may
have to shut the city down.

00:57.144 --> 00:58.493
What does that mean for SWAT?

00:58.536 --> 01:00.234
It means the world's
about to change.

still going strong.

I'm losing him in the dust.

Get down on the ground!

Hands out in front

02:50.692 --> 02:52.215
We also got a totaled van

02:52.259 --> 02:53.825
and a bunch
of stolen merchandise--

02:53.869 --> 02:58.003
disinfectant wipes,
latex gloves, hospital masks...

02:58.047 --> 02:59.396

Seriously, dude?

03:01.529 --> 03:04.749
This virus has people
losing their damn minds.

03:11.278 --> 03:15.499
Hey, Sybil, it's Hondo,
dropping off our contribution.

03:15.543 --> 03:16.848
Hondo.

03:16.892 --> 03:19.764
Nichelle. Hey. I...

03:19.808 --> 03:21.723
I didn't know...

03:21.766 --> 03:23.246
When'd you get
back to L.A.?

03:23.290 --> 03:24.639
Day before last.

03:24.682 --> 03:27.337
With the pandemic,
we had to cut the trip short.

03:27.381 --> 03:30.340
Plenty to do back here,
though, as you can see.

03:30.384 --> 03:31.820
The place is looking
really great.

03:33.561 --> 03:35.650
Listen, I've been out there
working, doing my thing.

03:35.693 --> 03:37.695
Otherwise, I'd come over there
and give you a big old squeeze.

03:37.739 --> 03:39.915
Bad idea. I just
got off a plane.
Oh.

03:39.958 --> 03:42.526
Still getting used
to all the new guidelines.

03:42.570 --> 03:45.268
Not sure my hands can take
much more sanitizer.

03:45.312 --> 03:46.617
Coming from the woman
whose lotion budget's

03:46.661 --> 03:47.749

03:49.968 --> 03:52.536
Sybil said you've been
stopping by,

03:52.580 --> 03:53.929
helping get things done. Thanks.

03:53.972 --> 03:55.409
Well, it's the
least I can do.

03:55.452 --> 03:56.714
Everything this place
does for folks

03:56.758 --> 03:58.325
stuck at home
with no groceries...

03:58.368 --> 04:01.719
I mean, people are really
scared out there right now.

04:01.763 --> 04:04.026
Yeah. Everyone around here has
been calling it "the Rona."

04:04.069 --> 04:06.594
Hmm.
Maybe a nickname
makes it less scary.

04:06.637 --> 04:08.378
Hmm.I imagine

04:08.422 --> 04:10.554
you guys are as busy as ever.Oh, yeah.

04:10.598 --> 04:12.991
Lot of us have been taking extra
shifts, helping out in patrol.

04:13.035 --> 04:14.906
You mean criminals didn't get
the shutdown memo?

04:14.950 --> 04:16.386
Nah. Nobody told 'em.

04:16.430 --> 04:18.387

04:19.433 --> 04:20.911
Stay safe, Hondo.

04:20.956 --> 04:22.827
It's good to see you again.

04:22.871 --> 04:25.787
It's really good
to see you, too.

04:25.830 --> 04:27.919
Hey, listen, I-I know it's been
a while since we spoke,

04:27.963 --> 04:30.008
but, um, you know,
once you get all settled in,

04:30.052 --> 04:31.880
I'd love a chance to
speak to you for real.

04:31.923 --> 04:33.577
I mean, do you think
we could do that?Listen, Hondo...

04:33.621 --> 04:35.362
I never felt right
about how we left things.

04:35.405 --> 04:37.494
It's okay. You don't have
to say anything about that.

04:37.538 --> 04:39.583
Nichelle, you deserve
an explanation.

04:39.627 --> 04:41.063
Hondo, I met someone.

04:44.632 --> 04:46.764
It's probably too early
to say anything,

04:46.808 --> 04:49.593
but I just wanted to be
up front.

04:49.637 --> 04:51.334
Sure. Sure, I appreciate that.

04:51.378 --> 04:54.076
I'm sorry if
I'm being presumptuous,

04:54.119 --> 04:56.513
but you should know,
you don't owe me an explanation.

04:56.557 --> 04:58.341
You don't owe me anything.

04:58.385 --> 04:59.951
You're a great person.

05:00.996 --> 05:02.563
So are you.

05:02.606 --> 05:05.566
All right, I, uh,
got to get going.

05:05.609 --> 05:07.742
Um...

05:07.785 --> 05:11.354
listen, if you ever
need anything, just...

05:11.398 --> 05:12.921
know that I'm around.

05:12.964 --> 05:14.966
Thanks.

05:15.010 --> 05:17.012
[quietly]:
Okay.

05:22.060 --> 05:23.758
Here are the new rules.

05:23.801 --> 05:25.847
Employees receive temperature
checks at the gate.

05:25.890 --> 05:27.588
All common areas are
to be sterilized hourly...

05:27.631 --> 05:30.373
Officers are to wear gloves
when detaining suspects.

05:30.417 --> 05:31.722
We're doing all those things
already.

05:31.766 --> 05:32.810
It's the same list as last week.

05:32.854 --> 05:34.159
Tests were supposed

05:34.203 --> 05:35.770
to be here five days ago.

05:35.813 --> 05:37.380
City hall is pulling out
all the stops

05:37.424 --> 05:39.382
against Sacramento
to help out the cops.

05:39.426 --> 05:41.384
When do you ever get to hear
that from a union lawyer?

05:41.428 --> 05:42.646
I'm-I'm sorry.

05:42.690 --> 05:44.779
Listen, COVID's
got us all scrambling.

05:44.822 --> 05:46.041
We're-we're down ten percent
of SWAT officers

05:46.084 --> 05:47.651
to quarantine, not
to mention the handful

05:47.695 --> 05:48.913
of officers that went to Germany

05:48.957 --> 05:50.045
before this whole thing started.

05:50.088 --> 05:51.481
How's Luca doing over there?

05:51.525 --> 05:52.700
Ah, he's as good
as he can be.

05:52.743 --> 05:54.005
He's in lockdown
like everybody else

05:54.049 --> 05:55.485
in Europe,
so it's not exactly

05:55.529 --> 05:56.791
the sightseeing trip
he had planned.

05:56.834 --> 05:58.401
All right,
just give him my best.

05:58.445 --> 06:00.447
I promise we're doing
everything we can on behalf

06:00.490 --> 06:01.796
of the office
to get you guys tested.

06:01.839 --> 06:03.885
Just hang in there.
How's the family?

06:03.928 --> 06:07.976
Well, I've only seen them on
video these past six days.

06:08.019 --> 06:10.544
Annie's brain surgery
a couple years back--

06:10.587 --> 06:12.502
her immune system is...

06:12.546 --> 06:14.156
I don't want to bring
this thing home.

06:14.199 --> 06:16.027
So I took up residence

06:16.071 --> 06:18.421
at the extended stay
the LAPD set up.

06:18.465 --> 06:20.162
Accommodations okay?

06:20.205 --> 06:22.425
A motel is a motel.

06:22.469 --> 06:24.514
I just miss my family.

06:24.558 --> 06:27.517
Fingers crossed,
we hear something soon.

06:27.561 --> 06:29.563
I'll keep you posted.

a very long two weeks.

07:09.907 --> 07:12.519
The man on the screen is
Salman Radek.

07:12.562 --> 07:14.085
He's a crime lord
turned fugitive.

07:14.129 --> 07:15.739
His hit squad
singlehandedly made

07:15.783 --> 07:17.132
kidnapping Chechnya's
most lucrative export.

07:17.175 --> 07:18.960
Yeah, I'm familiar.

07:19.003 --> 07:20.918
He forced his men to compete
to earn the highest ransom.

07:20.962 --> 07:23.573
This is the only interview
Radek ever gave.

07:23.617 --> 07:24.879
Sat for it in 2012.

07:24.922 --> 07:26.620
That's the same year
he blew up

07:26.663 --> 07:27.969
that apartment building
in Moscow, right?Same month.

07:28.012 --> 07:29.623
Authorities thought
they had him cornered,

07:29.666 --> 07:32.016
but nyet. He hopped
a flight to Istanbul.

07:32.060 --> 07:34.018
We can place him
in Budapest in 2016,

07:34.062 --> 07:35.759
and then Montreal
two years later,

07:35.803 --> 07:37.152
but he's been underground
ever since.

07:37.195 --> 07:39.850
Our theory is

07:39.894 --> 07:42.505
that he has someone set up
P.O. boxes wherever he is.

07:42.549 --> 07:44.246
Helps him collect cash,

07:44.289 --> 07:46.117
keeps control of his operations
via correspondence.

07:46.161 --> 07:50.034
Now this... was once rumored
to be that someone--

07:50.078 --> 07:51.601
Radek's former courier.

07:51.645 --> 07:52.950
He's never been identified,

07:52.994 --> 07:54.909

as "The Mailman."

Photo looks pretty dated.

It's the only thing we had

07:58.173 --> 08:00.784
until a couple hours ago
when a tip came in.

08:00.828 --> 08:02.525
Mailman's allegedly been spotted
two days in a row

08:02.569 --> 08:04.135

08:04.179 --> 08:05.876

That's why I'm talking to you.
With the pandemic

08:07.661 --> 08:09.967

can't find a team in time.

08:10.011 --> 08:11.795
We need SWAT to run surveillance
on the newsstand.

08:11.839 --> 08:13.275
HONDO:
Well, say we do find him.

08:13.318 --> 08:14.798
Are we even sure that
he's still in touch

08:14.842 --> 08:16.539
with Salman Radek anymore?

08:16.583 --> 08:18.106
When it comes to Radek,
we're not sure about anything,

08:18.149 --> 08:20.064
but it's our first shot at him
in at least five years.

10:16.790 --> 10:18.139
Relax. I'm walking here.

10:18.182 --> 10:19.401
You could have hit me!

10:19.444 --> 10:21.403
[horn honking]I'm not moving.

10:35.330 --> 10:36.810
Be there as soon as I can.

10:36.853 --> 10:38.420
HICKS:
It was a success.

10:38.463 --> 10:40.204
Tracker's on the car.
We're on his tail.

10:41.336 --> 10:42.380
Everything okay?

10:42.424 --> 10:44.426
I just spoke
to an Officer Schmidt.

10:44.469 --> 10:45.906
My mom was involved
in an altercation.

10:45.949 --> 10:47.777
She's hurt.
Go.

10:47.821 --> 10:48.778
Go, get out of here.

10:48.822 --> 10:49.910
[exhales]

10:55.089 --> 10:57.134
Well, looks like your guy's
keeping his distance.

10:57.178 --> 10:59.310
Well, it's hard to be covert
without cars on the road.

10:59.354 --> 11:00.703
Deacon's a pro.

11:00.747 --> 11:02.226
Good, because what we know
about The Mailman,

11:02.270 --> 11:03.706
he's always on edge.

11:03.750 --> 11:05.795
What are the odds this guy's
still in Radek's orbit?

11:05.839 --> 11:07.492
We're not even sure
that Radek has an orbit.

11:07.536 --> 11:09.320
Half the division
at Langley thinks he's dead.

11:09.364 --> 11:10.887
You agree with your colleagues?

11:10.931 --> 11:12.323
Well, I came up
in surveillance tech.

11:12.367 --> 11:13.542
Not as an ops officer.

11:13.585 --> 11:15.413
There's a reason
they're there and I'm here.

11:15.457 --> 11:16.980
I think Radek's alive.

11:17.024 --> 11:18.329
And I want to find his ass.

11:18.373 --> 11:21.245
[vibrating]Give me a sec.

11:21.289 --> 11:22.725
What's the latest, Deac?

11:22.769 --> 11:25.859
The Mailman was just dropped off
at a gated residence.

11:25.902 --> 11:28.426
303 Coralberry Road-- could be
where Radek's laying low.

11:28.470 --> 11:30.472
â™ª

11:34.215 --> 11:35.738
HICKS:
Got the property record.

11:35.782 --> 11:37.435
It's owned by an LLC in Bermuda.

11:37.479 --> 11:40.003
Looks like they paid
for a landline, too.

11:40.047 --> 11:41.483
Tell him I'll meet him there.
I can help us get tapped in.

11:41.526 --> 11:42.789
Deac, stay put

11:42.832 --> 11:44.051
until he makes a move.

11:44.094 --> 11:46.009
Reinforcements are on the way.Roger that.

11:48.272 --> 11:51.058
[helicopter blades whirring]

11:51.101 --> 11:52.233
Hey, Mom.

11:52.276 --> 11:53.756
You okay?Hold up, sir.

11:53.800 --> 11:55.497
I told the officer
not to call you.

11:55.540 --> 11:56.890
I thought she would
let me go home

11:56.933 --> 11:58.935
if she knew my son was
a police officer.

11:58.979 --> 12:00.110
She said there was
an altercation.

12:00.154 --> 12:01.198
Who did this to you?

12:01.242 --> 12:02.199
I don't want to talk about it.

12:02.243 --> 12:04.071
Hey, I'm Officer Tan.

12:04.114 --> 12:05.202
We spoke earlier.

12:05.246 --> 12:06.769
Who the hell hit her?We don't know.

12:06.813 --> 12:08.205
Suspect was gone
by the time we got here.

12:08.249 --> 12:11.034
Building picked it up
on their security camera.

12:12.079 --> 12:13.776
Video and audio.

12:13.820 --> 12:16.779
What are you trying to buy
in here?

12:16.823 --> 12:19.521
Answer me, lady.Food for dinner.

12:19.564 --> 12:21.392
Excuse me.MAN: Bats?

12:21.436 --> 12:22.959
You making bat soup tonight?

12:23.003 --> 12:24.831
FEI:
Please, just go away.

12:24.874 --> 12:26.093
MAN: Me go away?
How about you go away?!

12:26.136 --> 12:27.398
How about you go back to China

12:27.442 --> 12:29.270
and take all your filthy
diseases with you?!

12:29.313 --> 12:30.880
[grunts]

12:30.924 --> 12:33.187
SCHMIDT:
Video didn't show
what vehicle he left in.

12:33.230 --> 12:34.579
Who's out chasing this guy down?

12:34.623 --> 12:36.451
Nobody, not right now.Why the hell not?

12:36.494 --> 12:38.845
Your mom won't press charges.
Even if she did,

12:38.888 --> 12:40.411
we don't have
anything else to go on.

12:40.455 --> 12:43.240
Awful as this is, there's not
much we can do. You're a cop.

12:43.284 --> 12:44.546
You know all this, right?Fine.

12:44.589 --> 12:45.895
I'll take things from here.

12:45.939 --> 12:47.244
Hey, come on, Mom.

12:47.288 --> 12:48.419
We're gonna go home, okay?

12:51.466 --> 12:54.599
This place is a compound.

12:54.643 --> 12:57.951
The Mailman guy's blasting
the local news at full volume.

12:57.994 --> 13:00.083
He's either trying
to drown out his voice

13:00.127 --> 13:01.824
or he's running
an unlicensed nursing home.

13:03.347 --> 13:04.435
Hey.

13:04.479 --> 13:07.830
Maybe we can lift
prints from this?

13:07.874 --> 13:11.138
You really think he's hiding
Radek inside somewhere?

13:11.181 --> 13:13.140
I don't know. He's got to be
hiding something; otherwise,

13:13.183 --> 13:14.881
why burn all your trash
bin-Laden style?

13:14.924 --> 13:17.405
Hey, Deac, I'm not even getting
one cell signal from the house.

13:17.448 --> 13:18.841
That's strange.

13:18.885 --> 13:20.495
We're tapping
into the landline in a minute.

13:20.538 --> 13:22.236
CHRIS:
Roger.

13:22.279 --> 13:23.454
Still no heat signature.

13:23.498 --> 13:24.891
We know The Mailman's in there.

13:24.934 --> 13:26.109
We should be getting something.

13:26.153 --> 13:27.458
Maybe the machine's
malfunctioning.

13:27.502 --> 13:28.808
No, it's working.

13:28.851 --> 13:30.635
Maybe they got some kind
of coding on the walls

13:30.679 --> 13:33.900
or something that blocks
heat signatures.

13:33.943 --> 13:35.423
I've never heard of that.Yeah, me, either.

13:35.466 --> 13:37.512
Street, look.

13:40.167 --> 13:41.255
STREET:
There's a boy in the yard.

13:41.298 --> 13:42.865
CHRIS:
A boy? How old?

13:42.909 --> 13:43.997
Uh, maybe nine, ten?

13:44.040 --> 13:46.956
He's got some serious bruises.

13:47.000 --> 13:49.393
Someone in there is
roughing this kid up.

13:49.437 --> 13:50.394
MAILMAN:
Mischa, where'd you go?

13:50.438 --> 13:52.309
Get back in here!

13:52.353 --> 13:55.486
[phone dialing]It's a landline.

13:55.530 --> 13:57.314
Are y'all picking this up?CHRIS: Roger.

13:57.358 --> 13:59.142
DEACON:
It's an outbound call.

13:59.186 --> 14:01.188
Can you see the number
that's being dialed?[line ringing]

14:01.231 --> 14:02.929
Yeah. He's calling
a restaurant-- Fetterman's Deli.

14:02.972 --> 14:04.887
It's a restaurant in the Valley.

14:04.931 --> 14:06.193
Just found the menu online.

14:06.236 --> 14:07.324
Deacon, get her on that line.

14:07.368 --> 14:08.935
Connect 24-David to the call.

14:08.978 --> 14:10.937
Yeah.

14:10.980 --> 14:13.069
[line ringing]

14:13.113 --> 14:15.332
Come on. Come on,
come on, come on.

14:15.376 --> 14:17.160
MAILMAN:
Hello?

14:17.204 --> 14:18.161
Come on, come on.

14:18.205 --> 14:19.380
DEACON:
You're patched.

14:19.423 --> 14:20.990
Hello? Anyone there?Fetterman's.

14:21.034 --> 14:23.253
May I take your order?I want takeout.

14:23.297 --> 14:24.689
Three number sixes,
two number sevens.

14:24.733 --> 14:27.910
How many kabobs come
in your deluxe combo platter?

14:27.954 --> 14:29.346
Four.

14:29.390 --> 14:30.521
I want two combo platters.

14:30.565 --> 14:31.958
Awful lot of food
for no heat signals.

14:32.001 --> 14:33.176
He's got a whole crew in there.

14:33.220 --> 14:34.395
Is that everything?

14:34.438 --> 14:36.527
We've got a free
delivery special today.

14:36.571 --> 14:39.052
No. I said "takeout."
I'll come pick it up.

14:39.095 --> 14:40.227
It's free.No.

14:40.270 --> 14:42.142
Okay. Uh, can I get a name?

14:42.185 --> 14:44.187
John. I'll be there
in 20 minutes.

14:44.231 --> 14:46.059
HONDO:
Chris, go.

14:46.102 --> 14:48.539
Tan's on his way back.
I'll have him meet you there.

14:56.417 --> 14:58.680
Mic fit inside the container?

14:58.723 --> 15:00.595
Yup. Can't even tell it's there.

15:04.773 --> 15:06.557
There's another man in the car.

15:06.601 --> 15:09.125
It's not Radek.
He looks too young.

15:09.169 --> 15:11.084
They're both wearing masks.TAN: Just point

15:11.127 --> 15:12.433
the camera at their faces.

15:14.739 --> 15:17.307
Hi. You John?

15:17.351 --> 15:20.397
There you go.

15:20.441 --> 15:22.399
[camera shutter clicking]

15:22.443 --> 15:26.490
Oh, I'm sorry. I don't have
change for a hundred on me.

15:26.534 --> 15:27.752
Do you mind waiting?Keep the change.

15:27.796 --> 15:29.319
Are you sure?
It'll only take a second.

15:29.363 --> 15:31.278
Forget it.Thank you.

15:33.758 --> 15:37.110
HICKS:
She's got his eyes, but
that might not be enough.

15:37.153 --> 15:38.546
If we can't identify
someone in that house,

15:38.589 --> 15:40.417
the only thing we got tying
these people to Radek

15:40.461 --> 15:43.420
is secondhand intel
and a nine-year-old photo.

15:43.464 --> 15:45.031
Wait a minute.
Commander, check it out.

15:45.074 --> 15:47.076
We just got the name
of the passenger.

15:47.120 --> 15:48.425
Timur Basarov.

15:48.469 --> 15:49.774
Well, it looks like

15:49.818 --> 15:51.472
Timur's a wanted man
in Saint Petersburg.

15:51.515 --> 15:53.691
Sir, you see that stamp?
That's his regimental insignia.

15:53.735 --> 15:55.432
He's a Chechen soldier.

15:55.476 --> 15:57.086
In the Second
Chechen War,

15:57.130 --> 15:59.436
a unit of rebels branded
themselves "The Lone Wolf."

15:59.480 --> 16:01.308
And they were led
by Salman Radek.

16:05.486 --> 16:07.140
Anything since they got back,
Deac?

16:07.183 --> 16:08.750
DEACON:
They're talking really quietly.

16:08.793 --> 16:10.447
But at least we can hear
their conversations now.

16:10.491 --> 16:12.362
Two male voices,
possibly three.

16:12.406 --> 16:14.451
STREET:
If one's The Mailman,
and one's this soldier,

16:14.495 --> 16:16.323
you think
the third could be Radek?I'm not sure.

16:16.366 --> 16:18.194
Prebble's translating now.

16:18.238 --> 16:19.630
[arguing in Russian]

16:19.674 --> 16:22.198
Uh, one of the men
is getting angry.

16:22.242 --> 16:25.071
He says he's gonna leave.
He's walking out.

16:25.114 --> 16:26.072
Street, you get that?

16:26.115 --> 16:28.161
Roger. Staying low.

16:30.163 --> 16:31.991
Timur's behind the wheel.
The soldier.

16:38.649 --> 16:40.347
He turned the other way earlier.

16:40.390 --> 16:41.696
Heads up for a drive-by, Deac.

16:41.739 --> 16:43.524
All right, let's pack it up.

16:57.103 --> 16:59.148
Wonder where he's headed.Just keep your head down.

16:59.192 --> 17:01.629
Be cool. Let's go.Yeah.

17:01.672 --> 17:03.848
Damn it!
It's all right.
It's all right. Listen.

17:03.892 --> 17:06.373
We're just a couple of power
workers who dropped some stuff.

17:06.415 --> 17:08.069
It's no biggie.
Just pick it up.Okay. I got it.

17:08.114 --> 17:09.767
Hey, hold on. Hold on.

17:17.775 --> 17:19.690
He knows.[tires squealing]

17:19.733 --> 17:21.692
If he gets back to the house,
we're done.

17:21.736 --> 17:23.346
[tires squealing]

17:29.874 --> 17:31.354
[weapon fires]

17:31.398 --> 17:34.096
[man grunts]It's only

17:34.140 --> 17:35.576
a matter of time before they
realize he hasn't come back.

17:35.619 --> 17:38.057
We got to fix this.
We got to get him out of here.

17:40.450 --> 17:41.756
[phone ringing]

17:41.799 --> 17:43.149
Yeah, Deac.
You got anything?

17:43.192 --> 17:44.411
Yeah, we got something.

17:44.454 --> 17:45.542
We got a Chechen soldier.

17:45.586 --> 17:46.587
Bring his ass down here.

17:51.548 --> 17:54.377
How many people
are in that house?

17:54.421 --> 17:57.119
You ordered a hell of a lot
of food for only two guys.

17:57.163 --> 17:58.729
Being hungry a crime?

17:58.773 --> 18:00.209
Is Radek in L.A.?

18:00.253 --> 18:01.863
What if he is?Tell me

18:01.906 --> 18:03.734
if Radek is in that house.

18:03.778 --> 18:05.867
TIMUR: Why don't you ring
the doorbell and find out?

18:05.910 --> 18:07.782
Answering every question
with a question.
Well,

18:07.825 --> 18:10.567
he's running out the clock. He
knows if he stalls long enough,

18:10.611 --> 18:12.439
his buddies will wonder
where he is,

18:12.482 --> 18:14.571
figure something's up
and bolt.

18:14.615 --> 18:16.530
It won't be long
before they realize we have him.

18:16.573 --> 18:19.272
Sir, there may be a way
to explain his absence

18:19.315 --> 18:21.404
so the people in that house
don't start asking questions

18:21.448 --> 18:23.189
in the first place.

18:25.713 --> 18:29.151
Hey.Luca's brother really
came through for us.

18:29.195 --> 18:31.197
Yeah. Terry's got real
connections in the news world.

18:31.240 --> 18:33.590
He had two stations in a bidding
war for this accident footage.

18:33.634 --> 18:35.549
Just hope the guys
in that house buy it.

18:35.592 --> 18:37.377
Forensics is gonna
send a report to us

18:37.420 --> 18:38.943
as soon as they get it.

18:38.987 --> 18:41.294
They combed through the SUV
before we had it towed.

18:41.337 --> 18:44.253
I just got it.
Item eight--

18:44.297 --> 18:46.342
electronic key fob
with handwritten letters.

18:46.386 --> 18:48.910
"RUS."Yeah. Detective found it
under the driver's seat.

18:48.953 --> 18:50.564
Thinks it's at least
20 years old.

18:50.607 --> 18:52.653
He figures it's Russian.
The number "28" is on the back.

18:52.696 --> 18:55.264
All right, Deac, why don't
you grab this key fob
out of evidence?

18:55.308 --> 18:57.266
Head over
to Rob Ulmer Storage.

18:57.310 --> 18:59.573
Place is ancient.
"R-U-S." You never know.

18:59.616 --> 19:01.531
All right, sure thing.

19:01.575 --> 19:03.533
[phone ringing]

19:04.969 --> 19:06.493
Hey, thanks for calling me back.

19:06.536 --> 19:07.972
HONDO:
Yeah, of course.

19:08.016 --> 19:09.278
What's going on?

19:09.322 --> 19:11.280
A lady I worked with

19:11.324 --> 19:13.282
last week in New Orleans
is sick now.

19:13.326 --> 19:14.936
Fever, deep cough.

19:14.979 --> 19:16.546
She's waiting
on COVID test results.

19:16.590 --> 19:17.982
Thought I should tell you

19:18.026 --> 19:19.636
since we were
in the same room together.

19:19.680 --> 19:21.247
Oh, wow.

19:21.290 --> 19:22.726
Thank you for that.
I appreciate it.

19:22.770 --> 19:24.380
They're keeping a pretty
close eye on us over here.

19:24.424 --> 19:26.513
Trust me.
But I'll stay careful.

19:26.556 --> 19:27.992
Are you okay? You're not
feeling sick, are you?

19:28.036 --> 19:29.646
No, not at all.

19:29.690 --> 19:31.692
But I'm gonna quarantine
for a while just to be safe.

19:31.735 --> 19:33.433
I'm sorry to hear that.

19:33.476 --> 19:35.261
What are you gonna do
about tonight?

19:35.304 --> 19:36.958
Who's gonna drop off the food
for the folks stuck inside?

19:37.001 --> 19:38.394
Well, everyone's gonna get
their meals.

19:38.438 --> 19:39.656
Just might not be tonight.

19:39.700 --> 19:41.528
Why don't you let me
handle that?

19:41.571 --> 19:42.920
You already have so much
going on with work.

19:42.964 --> 19:44.444
If I have to work,

19:44.487 --> 19:45.836
I'll just get somebody else

19:45.880 --> 19:47.316
to deliver the food for me.

19:47.360 --> 19:48.535
I know Darryl would love
to help out.

19:48.578 --> 19:51.494
Girl, will you let me be useful?

19:51.538 --> 19:53.017
Yeah, okay.

19:53.061 --> 19:55.368
That's, uh, so kind of you.

19:55.411 --> 19:56.717
Thank you so much, Hondo.

19:56.760 --> 19:58.414
Any time.

19:58.458 --> 20:00.460
Just take care of yourself.

20:00.503 --> 20:02.984
Bye.

20:03.027 --> 20:05.204
[sighs]

20:06.944 --> 20:08.903
I heard something happened
to your mom.

20:08.946 --> 20:10.513
She okay?

20:10.557 --> 20:11.906
She got attacked
by some racists

20:11.949 --> 20:13.690
at a market blaming
her for coronavirus.

20:13.734 --> 20:15.431
Knocked her down so hard,
she needs stitches.

20:15.475 --> 20:16.867
It's all on tape.

20:16.911 --> 20:18.434
Wow. I'm so sorry.

20:18.478 --> 20:20.306
I mean, they should be able
to catch the guy.

20:20.349 --> 20:21.698
They got it on video, right?

20:21.742 --> 20:22.917
No, she won't
press charges,

20:22.960 --> 20:24.571
so they're not even
looking for him.

20:24.614 --> 20:26.442
I called in a favor with
a buddy in video forensics.

20:26.486 --> 20:28.531
I'll find him, make sure
he knows what's what.

20:28.575 --> 20:29.880
Hey, I get it, I do,
but just try

20:29.924 --> 20:32.013
to stay in control
on this, all right?

20:32.056 --> 20:33.710
That's easy for you to say.
It wasn't your mom.

20:33.754 --> 20:36.017
This where he was headed
before you stopped him?

20:36.060 --> 20:37.714
It's the operating theory.

20:37.758 --> 20:39.629
Here we go--
storage unit 28.

20:39.673 --> 20:41.892
Let's see if that
key fob works.

20:41.936 --> 20:43.503
[beeps]

20:51.075 --> 20:52.773
TAN:
Major firepower.

20:52.816 --> 20:54.601
DEACON: Yeah, but not
enough left to warrant

20:54.644 --> 20:55.993
a return trip.

20:56.037 --> 20:57.908
Look at that.
The sandwich is still fresh.

20:57.952 --> 20:59.606
Someone's been staying here.Who? The Mailman?

20:59.649 --> 21:02.478
We've had eyes on him all day.
That doesn't add up.

21:02.522 --> 21:04.741
Unless Radek's never been to
that house in the first place.

21:04.785 --> 21:06.656
You think Radek's
been staying here?

21:12.096 --> 21:15.012
[gunfire]STREET: Kid sure likes
playing Combat Town.

21:16.057 --> 21:17.711
You can hear the TV.

21:17.754 --> 21:18.799
Listen.

21:18.842 --> 21:20.583
REPORTER:
Unidentified driver

21:20.627 --> 21:21.628
is undergoing surgery

21:21.671 --> 21:23.412
at L.A. County Hospital.

21:23.456 --> 21:24.935
Think they buy it.

21:24.979 --> 21:28.635
There'd be a lot more commotion
in there if they didn't.

21:30.506 --> 21:32.769
[sighs] How's it going
with you and Molly

21:32.813 --> 21:34.815
locking down in separate place?Actually, uh,

21:34.858 --> 21:37.034
since she's working from home,
we're locking down together

21:37.078 --> 21:38.601
from her place for now.

21:38.645 --> 21:40.560
It felt like the next step.

21:40.603 --> 21:42.692
We're just doing it
a little sooner, you know?

21:44.651 --> 21:46.000
If I ask you something,

21:46.043 --> 21:48.655
promise not to take
it the wrong way?

21:49.656 --> 21:50.918
Sure.

21:50.961 --> 21:53.137
What is it about
Molly for you?

21:53.181 --> 21:56.750
Like, what made it the
right connection for you?

21:56.793 --> 21:59.970
Uh, you know,
she's selfless. Thoughtful.

22:00.014 --> 22:03.060
Smart as hell. Good heart.Sure,

22:03.104 --> 22:04.932
but you didn't know any of that
when you first met.

22:04.975 --> 22:07.064
She's beautiful, obviously,

22:07.108 --> 22:09.937
but at the beginning...

22:09.980 --> 22:11.939
what did you see in her?

22:11.982 --> 22:14.594
Well, I guess I've always
just been a risk-taker,

22:14.637 --> 22:17.466
and Molly Hicks seemed like
a risk worth taking.

22:17.510 --> 22:18.554
Why?

22:18.598 --> 22:20.469
[door opens]

22:32.568 --> 22:35.397
CHRIS:
Those bruises.
You see the handprints?

22:35.441 --> 22:37.834
STREET:
An adult did that,
and they're fresh.

22:37.878 --> 22:40.010
I always hated going to school
after my dad hit me.

22:40.054 --> 22:42.839
Especially in the
places you can't hide.

22:42.883 --> 22:44.101
MAILMAN:
Mischa!

22:44.145 --> 22:45.581
Where are you?

22:45.625 --> 22:47.453
We got to get him out of there.Street,

22:47.496 --> 22:48.758
we got different orders.

22:56.070 --> 22:58.028
Screw orders.
This is a hurt kid.Hey.

22:58.072 --> 23:00.161
I know it sucks,
but we can't move in

23:00.204 --> 23:02.381
until we're sure Radek's inside,
all right?

23:12.826 --> 23:15.437
Aren't there rumors
that he's diabetic?

23:20.573 --> 23:21.791
What's the word from the CIA?

23:21.835 --> 23:23.880
Well,
Prebble thinks it's promising.

23:23.924 --> 23:26.056
Unis are chasing down the
owner of the storage facility

23:26.100 --> 23:28.581
for the security footage.Yeah, good luck with that.

23:28.624 --> 23:30.539
Sir, Rob Ulmer died in '88.

23:30.583 --> 23:31.845
Junior's in Orlando,

23:31.888 --> 23:33.673
and their security system's
like a six iron.

23:33.716 --> 23:35.892
Well, other than that,
it's a hell of a plan.

23:35.936 --> 23:37.894
Come on, Commander.
You think Salman Radek

23:37.938 --> 23:39.809
is really hanging out
in storage lockers?

23:39.853 --> 23:41.724
I guess his travel plans
could have changed

23:41.768 --> 23:44.074
when flights shut down,
left him in between hideouts.

23:44.118 --> 23:46.076
We don't even know yet
why he'd be in L.A.

23:46.120 --> 23:47.730
Commander, a guy that big,

23:47.774 --> 23:49.906
I just can't see him crashing on
the floor of a storage locker.

23:49.950 --> 23:51.821
Plus, the guys in that
house are way too quiet.

23:51.865 --> 23:54.433
I'm betting that
Radek is in there.[phone vibrating]

23:58.262 --> 24:00.787
Yeah, Street, what's up?
Talk to me.STREET: The kid in the house

24:00.830 --> 24:02.484
is getting the crap beat out
of him. We got to pull him.

24:02.528 --> 24:04.791
Hey, lower your voice,
Street. Do not blow this op.

24:04.834 --> 24:06.793
Someone in that house
is using insulin.

24:06.836 --> 24:08.838
If Radek's diabetic,
it's got to be him.

24:08.882 --> 24:10.927
That is not proof, kid.
No. Not yet.

24:10.971 --> 24:12.581
My first day of kindergarten,
you know what I remember?

24:12.625 --> 24:14.496
My mom putting makeup on my chin

24:14.540 --> 24:16.106
to cover up my dad's
crappy weekend.

24:16.150 --> 24:17.673
We can help this boy, Hondo.

24:17.717 --> 24:19.501
We are not authorized to raid

24:19.545 --> 24:22.069
until we know for a fact
that Radek's in that house.

24:22.112 --> 24:24.114
That means actual photographic

24:24.158 --> 24:27.117
or DNA proof, Street.
This conversation is over.

24:27.161 --> 24:29.511
Just let me slip through
the gate. I can signal him.Okay, you know what? That's it.

24:29.555 --> 24:31.252
Your shift is done.
You get your ass

24:31.295 --> 24:33.820
back here to HQ right now.
I'm taking your spot.

24:49.096 --> 24:50.967
Radek ever come out
for some fresh air?

24:51.011 --> 24:52.534
CHRIS:
He's lived on the run
a long time.

24:52.578 --> 24:53.970
Guess he's disciplined.TAN:
Yeah, still,

24:54.014 --> 24:55.102
they got a huge yard.

24:55.145 --> 24:56.146
You'd think
he'd want some sunshine.

24:56.190 --> 24:58.758
As high as the FAA allows, Tan.

24:58.801 --> 25:00.020
TAN:
Going all the way up.

25:05.199 --> 25:07.070
[exhales][chuckles softly]

25:07.114 --> 25:10.160
Extended Stays
ain't the Taj Mahal, huh?

25:10.204 --> 25:11.858
Deac, it's got to be tough
not being able to go home

25:11.901 --> 25:13.642
and see Annie and the kids.Yeah.

25:13.686 --> 25:15.339
It's been pretty rough.

25:15.383 --> 25:17.907
Slim chance I'll
be getting tested

25:17.951 --> 25:19.822
on a regular basis
anytime soon,

25:19.866 --> 25:23.086
so makes it even
harder on my family.

25:25.828 --> 25:27.438
Hey, I meant to tell you,

25:27.482 --> 25:29.789
it's really great stuff you're
doing at the community center.

25:29.832 --> 25:31.704
Lot of people
struggling right now.

25:31.747 --> 25:34.576
Yeah.I'm guessing you, uh,

25:34.620 --> 25:36.839
you got back together with
the woman that runs the place?

25:36.883 --> 25:39.102
[chuckles]
No, Deac. She, uh...

25:39.146 --> 25:41.975
Apparently, she's seeing
some other dude now.

25:46.414 --> 25:48.547
Before she left, uh...

25:50.070 --> 25:52.028
I just keep replaying
our last conversation

25:52.072 --> 25:55.031
over and over in my head, and...

25:55.075 --> 25:58.774
I got to admit,
I screwed that all up.

25:58.818 --> 26:01.255
Well, if it's eating at you,

26:01.298 --> 26:04.084
maybe you still got
something to say.

26:04.127 --> 26:06.869
I don't know,
Deac. I just...

26:06.913 --> 26:10.090
I care about her too much
to confuse things for her.

26:10.133 --> 26:12.048
It's never too late to tell
someone you care about

26:12.092 --> 26:13.180
that you messed up.

26:13.223 --> 26:16.096
[both chuckle]

26:16.139 --> 26:18.925
What's that on the roof?

26:20.927 --> 26:23.016
It's an industrial-size AC unit.

26:23.059 --> 26:26.236
That is overkill for
a house that size.

26:26.280 --> 26:28.369
Do you think that if that unit

26:28.412 --> 26:31.894
is consistently pumping cold
air within the exterior walls,

26:31.938 --> 26:33.069
that's what's blocking
our thermal reader?

26:33.113 --> 26:34.288
Acting as a shield?

26:34.331 --> 26:36.029
That'd be some advanced
countersurveillance.

26:36.072 --> 26:38.335
It's like they got
somebody to hide.

26:38.379 --> 26:40.947
How familiar are you
with industrial units like that?

26:40.990 --> 26:43.384
Well, not enough to repair one.

26:43.427 --> 26:45.647
But I bet I could break it.

26:47.170 --> 26:48.911
STREET:
Hey, Commander.

26:48.955 --> 26:50.783
What's up?

26:50.826 --> 26:52.959
Hondo wanted me back here
to check on something.

26:54.003 --> 26:55.091
Anything to do with this?

26:56.963 --> 27:00.270
"Syringe contained
no DNA sufficient for testing."

27:00.314 --> 27:02.751
Without Radek's DNA,
there's no proof he's inside.

27:02.795 --> 27:04.710
Guess that's why
they burn their trash.

27:04.753 --> 27:06.799
Well, there's no proof
he's not inside, either.

27:06.842 --> 27:09.192
His DNA didn't show up
on that storage locker.

27:11.194 --> 27:13.153
Iryna Melnik, 17.

27:13.196 --> 27:15.677
Flew over here from Belarus
before the flights shut down.

27:15.721 --> 27:17.418
Said she was here for
an arranged marriage.

27:17.461 --> 27:19.115
That's who was sleeping
in the storage locker?

27:19.159 --> 27:21.074
Cops picked her up a mile
from Rob Ulmer Storage.

27:21.117 --> 27:22.858
Apparently, she was
told to wait there,

27:22.902 --> 27:24.730
but she must have
panicked and fled.

27:24.773 --> 27:26.296
The CIA thinks
she came to L.A.

27:26.340 --> 27:27.733
to be Radek's next wife.

27:27.776 --> 27:29.778
Keep at it.

27:42.748 --> 27:44.706
â™ª

27:53.497 --> 27:56.370
[door slides open]

28:06.380 --> 28:08.948
CHRIS:
It's a new guy.

28:08.991 --> 28:10.776
It's gonna take him a minute
to burn everything.

28:14.997 --> 28:16.869
Let me know
when he comes back this way.

28:32.493 --> 28:35.496
HONDO: Deacon, freeze.
The Mailman's right below you.

28:40.370 --> 28:41.720
Tarkhan?

28:44.418 --> 28:45.985
Tarkhan?

28:50.076 --> 28:52.861
He forgot his lighter.
Deac, he's coming back now.

29:05.918 --> 29:07.963
â™ª

29:13.926 --> 29:15.014
Made it.

29:15.057 --> 29:16.972
All right, Mr. Fix-it Man,
go to town.

29:17.016 --> 29:19.453
[beeps]

29:19.496 --> 29:22.151
Yeah, it's just what I thought.
42 degrees.

29:28.636 --> 29:30.769
[electrical crackling]

29:32.640 --> 29:34.990
[whirring slows]

29:46.349 --> 29:48.438
You did it, Deac.
They're lighting up.

29:48.482 --> 29:50.092
All right, we got six bodies
on my count.

29:50.136 --> 29:51.572
Four in the front of the house,
two in the back.

29:51.615 --> 29:53.182
You see that movement
on the back side?

29:53.226 --> 29:55.184
CHRIS:
Yeah. What's
going on in there?

29:55.228 --> 29:56.446
Someone's serving the man
in the back room.

29:56.490 --> 29:58.013
[phone vibrating]

29:59.319 --> 30:01.321
Yeah, what's up, Street?

30:01.364 --> 30:02.844
The kid in the house
is probably playing

30:02.888 --> 30:04.585
his video game right now.Hey, that's enough.

30:04.628 --> 30:07.240
Talking about the kid
ain't gonna help him, Street.

30:07.283 --> 30:09.808
No, I mean, I might have a way
to prove Radek's in that house.

30:12.288 --> 30:13.420
Tan, how's it coming?

30:13.463 --> 30:14.464
Give me a sec.

30:15.509 --> 30:16.902
[gunfire over TV]

30:16.945 --> 30:19.121
Okay. I just lost.

30:25.649 --> 30:27.608
Kid replied.Keep him talking, Tan.

30:46.409 --> 30:49.325
All right, I sent it.All right, let's get the drone
in position.

30:49.369 --> 30:50.849
Roger that.

30:56.028 --> 30:57.464
All right, he's in the room.

30:57.507 --> 30:59.248
The man still appears
to be sleeping. Are you ready?

31:00.467 --> 31:02.861
Good to go.

31:11.173 --> 31:13.567
[camera shutter clicking]

31:16.004 --> 31:17.484
Photo should be processing now,
Commander.

31:23.316 --> 31:24.578
We got him.

31:24.621 --> 31:25.622
Yeah.

31:29.365 --> 31:31.715
Before we go in, I'm
sorry for losing my cool.

31:31.759 --> 31:33.456
Okay, but you keep
your focus, Street.

31:33.500 --> 31:35.023
The real work
hasn't started yet.

31:35.067 --> 31:36.242
Chris, you good?

31:36.285 --> 31:37.939
Ready when you are.All right, listen up.

31:37.983 --> 31:40.420
We got five armed adult males
and one child at risk inside.

31:40.463 --> 31:42.596
We think Radek's
in the back room, east side.

31:42.639 --> 31:43.597
Now we're taking them by
surprise, so I need

31:43.640 --> 31:45.164
every access point covered.

31:45.207 --> 31:46.905
Everyone clear on their orders?Clear.
Clear.

31:47.644 --> 31:48.645
I'm clear.

31:48.689 --> 31:50.299
I know.

31:50.343 --> 31:52.258
Let's go.

31:54.651 --> 31:57.350
20-David to all perimeter units.
Let me know when you're set.

31:57.393 --> 32:00.179
24-David and 26-David set.On my command.

32:00.222 --> 32:01.441
Three, two,

32:01.484 --> 32:02.964
one.

32:05.184 --> 32:06.315
LAPD!

32:06.359 --> 32:07.403
We got the house surrounded!

32:14.628 --> 32:16.151
Armed suspect just ran
out of the house.

32:16.195 --> 32:17.544
Three-side, heading south.

32:17.587 --> 32:19.241
I'm on it.

32:21.591 --> 32:23.463
Police! Put the weapon down!

32:27.423 --> 32:29.164
[gunshot]

32:31.036 --> 32:34.169
Out in the hallway!
Step out slowly!

32:34.213 --> 32:36.650
Hands where I can see
them. On your knees!

32:36.693 --> 32:38.652
Get on your knees!

32:38.695 --> 32:40.697
Hands behind your head.

32:42.482 --> 32:43.657
Where's Radek?

32:51.317 --> 32:53.319
Mischa, wait.

33:06.419 --> 33:09.117
Hey. I'm a
policeman.

33:09.161 --> 33:11.380
Run outside to the yard.
Come on. You'll be safe there.

33:12.512 --> 33:16.255
MAILMAN:
Mischa. Hey.

33:16.298 --> 33:17.386
Hey. Come. Come here.

33:17.430 --> 33:18.692
Daddy wants to
talk to you.

33:20.172 --> 33:21.521
These men want to hurt us.

33:22.826 --> 33:24.741
Come on.

33:24.785 --> 33:26.395
[shouts]Down on the ground!

33:26.439 --> 33:27.744
Drop the weapon! Do not move!

33:27.788 --> 33:29.311
Show me your hands!

33:30.573 --> 33:32.314
Get outside, kid. Go!

33:40.844 --> 33:44.152
LAPD. Hands
above your head.

33:44.196 --> 33:45.197
Turn around.

33:47.590 --> 33:48.809
On your knees.

33:48.852 --> 33:51.594
Hands behind your head.

33:54.554 --> 33:55.642
[camera clicks]

33:58.601 --> 34:02.083
Chris, I got two guys zip-tied
in the south hall.

34:02.127 --> 34:04.607
We've got our target.
It's Radek.

34:04.651 --> 34:06.044
Good job, Deac. Well done.

34:07.480 --> 34:09.482
Great work.

34:09.525 --> 34:11.353
Well, I told you
they were the best.

34:11.397 --> 34:13.616
HONDO:
Photo's uploading, Commander.

34:18.491 --> 34:19.882
That's a look-alike.

34:19.927 --> 34:22.234
That's not Salman Radek.

34:34.898 --> 34:38.598
Radek's got to be somewhere
on this side of the house.

34:38.641 --> 34:41.253
Tan, switch the eyes in the sky
back into thermal.

34:41.295 --> 34:43.081
Roger that.

34:45.431 --> 34:47.824
There's someone moving your way
from inside the house, Hondo.

34:47.868 --> 34:50.130
He's just on the other side
of your wall.Is he headed east?

34:50.175 --> 34:52.306
No, he's moving exactly parallel
to you and he's got a gun.

34:52.351 --> 34:54.222
Well, one man down,
it must be Radek.

34:54.266 --> 34:55.614
How close is he to the door?

34:56.659 --> 34:57.791
TAN:
Five seconds.

34:59.793 --> 35:03.405
Three, two, one.

35:04.711 --> 35:06.191
Stay down.

35:06.234 --> 35:09.194
Stay down! Target
apprehended.

35:09.237 --> 35:11.805
Repeat: Radek in custody.

35:15.809 --> 35:17.680
Looks like Radek's
wedding is off.

35:17.724 --> 35:19.378
According to one of his men,
they were supposed

35:19.421 --> 35:21.945
to leave together a few days
ago, but he got spooked

35:21.989 --> 35:24.513
when travel was shut down and
figured he'd try to wait it out.

35:24.557 --> 35:27.168
That's the social worker
assigned to help the kid.

35:27.212 --> 35:28.430
She said he came here
from Chechnya

35:28.474 --> 35:29.910
three years ago
after his mom died.

35:29.953 --> 35:32.478
Molly said she'll try
to pull some strings.

35:32.521 --> 35:34.262
We know some great homes
that'll help keep him on track.

35:34.306 --> 35:36.308
That's-that's cool of her.

35:36.351 --> 35:38.658
Hey, uh, Molly and
I were talking,

35:38.701 --> 35:41.443
and the news is saying
as long as your friends follow

35:41.487 --> 35:43.445
the guidelines,
people can still hang out.

35:43.489 --> 35:44.968
Like, in a pod.

35:45.012 --> 35:46.796
Sounds more like coffee
than a real plan.

35:46.840 --> 35:49.408
Yeah, I know, but, uh,
if you're ever down,

35:49.451 --> 35:51.540
I'd love to
have you over.Maybe next time.

35:51.584 --> 35:53.586
See you tomorrow.
Cool.

35:54.848 --> 35:57.155
See you then.

36:03.291 --> 36:04.945
You Oliver Davis?

36:04.988 --> 36:06.686
I got a question
for you.

36:06.729 --> 36:08.731
If you think you'll get COVID
from an Asian American

36:08.775 --> 36:10.429
who's lived
in the U.S. for 30 years,

36:10.472 --> 36:11.865
why not leave her alone?

36:11.908 --> 36:13.258
Who are you?

36:13.301 --> 36:15.303
The son of the woman
you attacked outside the market.

36:15.347 --> 36:16.391
What woman?

36:16.435 --> 36:17.697
Her name's Fei.

36:17.740 --> 36:19.438
She was born in China,

36:19.481 --> 36:21.614
but she loves this country
and she's given it everything,

36:21.657 --> 36:23.572
including two sons:
a doctor and a cop.

36:23.616 --> 36:25.400
What have you done, huh?
Besides taunt people

36:25.444 --> 36:26.575
who don't look
like you?

36:26.619 --> 36:28.316
Give an old woman stitches?

36:28.360 --> 36:30.536
We got video
of what you did.

36:30.579 --> 36:32.712
Even worse for you, I'm the cop.

36:32.755 --> 36:33.843
I didn't do anything.

36:33.887 --> 36:34.975
She tripped.

36:35.018 --> 36:36.498
Yeah, there you go.
Now you remember.

36:36.542 --> 36:38.718
Hey, stay right there,
ma'am. LAPD.

36:38.761 --> 36:40.328
What'd my brother do?

36:40.372 --> 36:41.938
Doesn't concern you.

36:41.982 --> 36:43.026
He's sick, you know.

36:43.070 --> 36:44.463
Don't play the virus card.

36:44.506 --> 36:45.812
I didn't mean for her to fall.

36:45.855 --> 36:47.509
You can't arrest me.

36:47.553 --> 36:49.250
Oliver, whatever you did,
I don't have cash

36:49.294 --> 36:50.860
until next week
to bail you out.

36:50.904 --> 36:52.949
So you might have to be
in jail over the weekend.

36:52.993 --> 36:55.865
He was in a motorcycle accident
18 years ago

36:55.909 --> 36:57.519
and he's never been...

36:57.563 --> 36:59.042
He's mentally ill.

36:59.086 --> 37:01.697
Hey, look, I know
about mental illness.

37:01.741 --> 37:03.264
I also know
what your brother said

37:03.308 --> 37:05.397
to my mom didn't
come out of nowhere.

37:07.790 --> 37:09.618
He may not have the mental
capacity to know better,

37:09.662 --> 37:10.880
but you do.

37:12.317 --> 37:13.535
[quietly]:
Go.

37:15.581 --> 37:17.800
So what kind of crap
are you saying around him?

37:26.418 --> 37:27.636
Hey, Commander,
what are you doing here?

37:27.680 --> 37:29.856
Well, you seemed pretty
upset when you left.

37:30.813 --> 37:33.555
Deacon filled me in
on what happened with your mom.

37:34.774 --> 37:36.079
Think I was gonna
do something stupid?

37:36.123 --> 37:37.994
Never crossed my mind.

37:38.038 --> 37:39.953
But I thought maybe

37:39.996 --> 37:43.304
if you did do something stupid,
I'd come by and stop you.

37:48.483 --> 37:50.616
ANNIE [over phone]:
I told her it wasn't easy
for Matthew to concentrate

37:50.659 --> 37:53.793
with 15 other kids
on the screen, and...

37:53.836 --> 37:55.403
you know, I can't look after him
the whole time.

37:55.447 --> 37:56.622
So... Hold on.LILA: Mommy!

37:56.665 --> 37:58.493
I'm waiting!Hey, honey?

37:58.537 --> 38:00.669
I told you we need
some Mom and Dad time, okay?

38:00.713 --> 38:02.323
Annie, it's okay.

38:02.367 --> 38:03.542
If you got to go handle it,
we'll talk later.

38:03.585 --> 38:04.673
You sure? I'm...

38:04.717 --> 38:06.327
I'm sorry.No, no. No problem.

38:06.371 --> 38:08.111
Just give me a call at bedtime,
all right?

38:08.155 --> 38:10.636
I promised Lila we'd get to
chapter nine of Charlotte's Web.

38:10.679 --> 38:13.639
Okay. We all miss you so much.

38:13.682 --> 38:15.684
Miss you, too.

38:15.728 --> 38:17.382
Love you guys.

38:17.425 --> 38:19.471
Love you, too.

38:21.821 --> 38:23.475
[sighs]

38:25.868 --> 38:27.870
[phone ringing]

38:34.834 --> 38:36.618
Hey, Nichelle.

38:36.662 --> 38:37.924
Oh, you're already there.

38:37.967 --> 38:39.578
I was hoping to catch you
before you...

38:39.621 --> 38:41.667
Is everything all right?My friend in New Orleans,

38:41.710 --> 38:42.972
her test came back negative,

38:43.016 --> 38:44.670
so I don't have to quarantine
after all.

38:44.713 --> 38:48.456
I can cover tonight, so please
go, enjoy your time off.

38:48.500 --> 38:49.588
And thank you so much.

38:49.631 --> 38:51.111
Nichelle, that's great news.

38:51.154 --> 38:52.982
Sorry you went all the way
over there.

38:53.026 --> 38:54.157
No, come on, don't be.

38:54.201 --> 38:55.985
I actually got
a lot done already,

38:56.029 --> 38:58.466
so I'll lock up
before you get here.

38:58.510 --> 39:01.600
Um, hey, uh,
do you have a minute?

39:01.643 --> 39:04.733
Um, there's something
I really need to say to you,

39:04.777 --> 39:07.606
and I'm just glad
that I can see your face.

39:07.649 --> 39:08.998
Sure. You okay?

39:09.042 --> 39:10.826
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I'm okay.

39:12.524 --> 39:16.832
Yeah, I'm okay, I just, um...
I wasn't.

39:16.876 --> 39:21.663
Um, before you left, you said me
and you want different things.

39:21.707 --> 39:24.884
And... I get why you said that.

39:24.927 --> 39:26.059
I do.

39:27.452 --> 39:29.410
It's just, you know,
it-it ain't easy

39:29.454 --> 39:32.631
when someone holds a mirror up
to your face and...

39:32.674 --> 39:34.981
you don't see the man
that you want to be.

39:37.244 --> 39:39.072
Look, Nichelle,
when I was a kid, you know,

39:39.115 --> 39:41.030
I'd see married couples
holding hands,

39:41.074 --> 39:43.076
you know,
laughing together and...

39:43.119 --> 39:46.993
But I was always just like,
"Damn," you know, "My parents...

39:47.036 --> 39:48.690
[laughs softly]

39:48.734 --> 39:52.085
...they just,
they got it wrong."

39:52.128 --> 39:56.524
And I think fear of repeating
their mistakes,

39:56.568 --> 39:59.222
it messed me and my sister's
head up for 30 years.

39:59.266 --> 40:01.442
You know?

40:01.486 --> 40:04.445
But for me, all that time,
I mean,

40:04.489 --> 40:06.926
I guess I just felt that the
rest of my life was moving along

40:06.969 --> 40:10.930
well enough that I didn't
really see it as a problem.

40:12.932 --> 40:14.934
Until I lost you.

40:16.501 --> 40:17.589
[exhales]
Listen, Hondo...

40:17.632 --> 40:18.938
No, no, no. Seriously.

40:18.981 --> 40:22.071
You don't have to say anything.

40:22.115 --> 40:23.899
I know it's too late, and...

40:25.727 --> 40:28.469
...and you've met someone else.

40:28.513 --> 40:30.166
I ain't gonna lie,
I really wish you hadn't,

40:30.210 --> 40:33.431
but... you did.

40:36.782 --> 40:38.261
I just want to tell you
I'm sorry.

40:38.305 --> 40:41.264
I'm-I'm sorry for being so
afraid when we were together,

40:41.308 --> 40:43.179
and letting you down
with your parents,

40:43.223 --> 40:46.618
because I know
I hurt you and I am sorry.

40:49.142 --> 40:51.274
The time that I had
with you, it...

40:51.318 --> 40:53.276
it changed how I look at life.

40:53.320 --> 40:57.455
It... It changed
what I want for myself.

41:00.719 --> 41:04.723
What I'm trying to say to you is

41:04.766 --> 41:07.116
because of you
holding me accountable,

41:07.160 --> 41:09.989
I'm actually at a better place
in my life than I was,

41:10.032 --> 41:14.036
and... I just want
to thank you for that.

41:15.037 --> 41:16.604
So...

41:20.042 --> 41:22.741
Good night, Nichelle.

41:24.264 --> 41:26.266
Good night, Hondo.
