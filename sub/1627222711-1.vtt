WEBVTT

00:05.005 --> 00:07.674
(ominous music)

00:12.220 --> 00:14.973
(fire crackling)

00:33.450 --> 00:36.870
(intense ethereal music)

00:51.634 --> 00:55.472
(dramatic instrumental music)

02:03.706 --> 02:06.668
(electricity crackling)

02:06.668 --> 02:09.628
- [Vincent] I'm from a
different metropolis,

02:09.628 --> 02:11.756
another city far away from here,

02:13.508 --> 02:15.218
but I've been in Marfa a long time

02:17.011 --> 02:19.681
and I refuse to accept
this town as the end,

02:19.681 --> 02:20.640
as my end.

02:22.142 --> 02:23.351
I need to leave here.

02:24.769 --> 02:26.646
I need to leave Marfa.

02:26.646 --> 02:29.649
And I know that my old friend
will struggle with that,

02:29.649 --> 02:30.942
even fight me on it.

02:32.192 --> 02:33.027
That's all right.

02:34.195 --> 02:38.783
Leaving here isn't going
to be easy for any of us.

02:38.783 --> 02:41.786
(tense piano music)

02:49.668 --> 02:51.504
We have a habit of trusting in fate,

02:53.464 --> 02:55.216
that things are out of our control.

02:56.216 --> 02:58.803
Me? I don't think so.

03:00.346 --> 03:01.848
I don't think that's the case.

03:03.349 --> 03:04.893
I don't think it's over for me.

03:06.060 --> 03:06.895
Not yet.

03:09.689 --> 03:12.358
(wind rustling)

03:21.826 --> 03:24.662
(easygoing music)

03:33.963 --> 03:36.132
- Two, three, four, five, six, seven.

03:37.091 --> 03:38.635
- [Vincent] Meet Matthew Bench.

03:39.677 --> 03:42.472
Now this guy pretends his fortune teller

03:42.472 --> 03:43.640
helps him lead the way

03:44.557 --> 03:45.642
in everything.

03:45.642 --> 03:47.810
Can't make a decision without it.

03:47.810 --> 03:49.562
But the truth is,

03:49.562 --> 03:51.564
I don't think even he believes it.

03:55.151 --> 03:58.529
Then there's Erik Streett, the quiet one.

03:59.656 --> 04:02.492
Uh-huh, never in a big hurry.

04:02.492 --> 04:03.618
He goes with the flow,

04:04.535 --> 04:06.204
but he's definitely unpredictable.

04:11.000 --> 04:12.085
Eden Percell.

04:13.461 --> 04:16.089
Obsessed with her cell phone.

04:17.923 --> 04:20.385
I guess she's really curious.

04:20.385 --> 04:22.220
Okay, who am I kidding?

04:22.220 --> 04:24.764
She's an odd one for sure.

04:29.560 --> 04:30.395
Allie Holliwell.

04:31.729 --> 04:32.939
Yep.

04:32.939 --> 04:35.108
She's a Looker for sure.

04:35.108 --> 04:37.068
Full of one-liners too.

04:37.068 --> 04:37.902
Funny.

04:37.902 --> 04:39.153
Kind of. Sort of.

04:39.988 --> 04:41.447
On her good days anyway.

04:42.490 --> 04:44.033
- Great song, huh?

04:44.033 --> 04:45.952
- Yeah, it's good the first 78 times.

04:45.952 --> 04:46.869
- Oh, come on, man.

04:46.869 --> 04:47.704
Don't be like that.

04:47.704 --> 04:49.706
You can never get enough of a good song.

04:49.706 --> 04:51.957
- Okay guys, this is my first
weekend out in a long time,

04:51.957 --> 04:53.835
other than books, my brother, and BF's,

04:53.835 --> 04:56.087
and I'm actually having fun.

04:56.087 --> 04:58.589
What did you think about
our first tequila cook off?

04:58.589 --> 05:01.551
- It's Terlingua cook off.

05:01.551 --> 05:04.387
You quote hypotheses about
scientific law and theory

05:04.387 --> 05:07.390
and a lot of crap people don't understand,

05:07.390 --> 05:09.100
but you can't get Terlingua
out of your mouth?

05:09.100 --> 05:10.393
- [Erik] Enough, Allie.

05:10.393 --> 05:11.436
Just relax.

05:11.436 --> 05:13.855
Knock it off, princess.

05:13.855 --> 05:15.148
- Okay, so Matt, did you have fun

05:15.148 --> 05:16.316
at that Terlingua cook off?

05:16.316 --> 05:17.859
- There you go.

05:17.859 --> 05:19.110
- I don't know.

05:19.110 --> 05:20.278
Let's ask my fortune teller.

05:20.278 --> 05:22.030
(eerie music)

05:22.030 --> 05:23.031
Did I have a good time?
- I thought those things

05:23.031 --> 05:25.074
just tell you yes, no, or maybe?

05:25.074 --> 05:27.410
- Nope. Mine is special.

05:27.410 --> 05:29.287
Boop, boop, boop, boop, boop.

05:29.287 --> 05:30.121
Boop.

05:30.997 --> 05:31.831
What does it say?

05:31.831 --> 05:34.082
It says that

05:35.209 --> 05:38.755
quite possibly the best
trip I've ever had.

05:38.755 --> 05:40.423
And I agree.

05:40.423 --> 05:42.925
(Eden laughs)

05:43.926 --> 05:46.220
And Eden, I'm proud of you.

05:46.220 --> 05:48.139
You actually got out of
your own little world

05:48.139 --> 05:49.599
and actually, you know,

05:49.599 --> 05:51.392
joined the human race
and talked with people.

05:51.392 --> 05:53.061
It was nice.
- Okay, yeah, okay.

05:53.061 --> 05:54.020
You know what?

05:54.020 --> 05:55.521
Not all of us can be in our junior year

05:55.521 --> 05:57.732
and clueless about what we
wanna do with our lives.

05:57.732 --> 06:00.026
Some of us have to, I don't know,

06:00.026 --> 06:01.652
you know, plan our life.

06:01.652 --> 06:02.487
- I'm not clueless.

06:02.487 --> 06:04.530
I'm just searching for myself.

06:05.907 --> 06:07.617
Sir, Erik.

06:07.617 --> 06:12.330
Erik, what did you think
of the tequila cook off?

06:12.330 --> 06:13.456
- Oh, you know,

06:13.456 --> 06:14.791
I think it was pretty kick-ass

06:14.791 --> 06:16.417
but a little hard to remember

06:16.417 --> 06:18.169
with Eden's phone in my face.

06:19.212 --> 06:20.046
Why do you have to record

06:20.046 --> 06:21.881
every single moment of your life anyway?

06:21.881 --> 06:23.174
You know it's probably
just gonna come back

06:23.174 --> 06:25.593
and haunt us all someday.

06:25.593 --> 06:27.136
Just chill.

06:27.136 --> 06:28.262
- [Allie] Word.

06:28.262 --> 06:30.431
- Everyone, shh, shh, shh.

06:31.641 --> 06:33.058
See, Eden?

06:33.058 --> 06:34.811
There's no such thing
as an awkward silence.

06:34.811 --> 06:37.105
- (laughs) It's awkward if Edie is silent.

06:37.105 --> 06:38.648
- Oh, okay, yeah.

06:38.648 --> 06:39.482
I'm the social one

06:39.482 --> 06:40.900
who always has something to say.

06:40.900 --> 06:41.943
Yeah, all right.

06:41.943 --> 06:43.528
You sure about that, Allie?

06:43.528 --> 06:44.779
- Silence!

06:44.779 --> 06:46.364
We've got a pit stop coming up ahead,

06:46.364 --> 06:49.283
but the question is, should we stop?

06:49.283 --> 06:50.784
Shall we?

06:50.784 --> 06:53.329
- Do you really have to ask
that thing that question?

06:53.329 --> 06:54.455
- Oh, we do, we do.

06:54.455 --> 06:55.957
- Or, you know, any questions at all?

06:55.957 --> 06:57.417
- We absolutely do

06:57.417 --> 06:58.793
and if anyone cares,

06:58.793 --> 07:02.296
it says that we should
keep it moving, people.

07:02.296 --> 07:03.840
- Oh, oh, oh!

07:03.840 --> 07:04.841
I think we should stop

07:04.841 --> 07:07.969
because Matt's little
friend here tells us so.

07:07.969 --> 07:09.053
- All right, fine.

07:10.263 --> 07:11.681
Don't come to me.

07:11.681 --> 07:13.224
Don't say that I didn't warn ya.

07:13.224 --> 07:15.309
- Good, 'cause I've had to take a leak

07:15.309 --> 07:16.894
since last Thanksgiving.

07:16.894 --> 07:19.522
Something your little piece
of paper didn't predict.

07:21.065 --> 07:22.942
- Mind over bladder, Erik.

07:22.942 --> 07:24.902
Simply mind over bladder.

07:24.902 --> 07:25.862
- Okay, Allie.

07:25.862 --> 07:27.822
I'll remember that next
time you have to go.

07:27.822 --> 07:29.866
(easygoing music)

07:29.866 --> 07:33.744
- [Vincent] These four, they
really look out for each other.

07:35.163 --> 07:38.374
And that, that was reason enough for me.

07:38.374 --> 07:40.126
♪ Who do you think you are ♪

07:40.126 --> 07:42.378
♪ You're on top ♪

07:42.378 --> 07:45.256
So, let's go back.

07:45.256 --> 07:48.634
(music warbling)

07:48.634 --> 07:51.471
Let me show you how we
found ourselves right here.

07:52.722 --> 07:55.224
(eerie music)

08:04.192 --> 08:06.277
- [Waitress] How about a
cup of pitch-black brew?

08:08.571 --> 08:09.906
- Hit me with the jet fuel.

08:11.866 --> 08:12.742
I'm gonna need it.

08:15.828 --> 08:18.122
You've worked here ever
since I entered Marfa.

08:19.207 --> 08:20.457
- [Waitress] Yes, I have.

08:23.336 --> 08:24.879
- You ever think about leaving?

08:28.424 --> 08:29.258
- Every day.

08:34.931 --> 08:36.474
Good morning, Mr. Mayor.

08:36.474 --> 08:38.142
Would you like some coffee?

08:38.142 --> 08:40.144
(Mayor inhales deeply)

08:40.144 --> 08:40.977
- No, thank you.

08:56.827 --> 08:58.371
- It cannot go on like this.

08:58.371 --> 08:59.705
- What are you talking about?

08:59.705 --> 09:01.165
- You know exactly what I'm talking about.

09:01.165 --> 09:02.667
- You know...

09:02.667 --> 09:05.878
How many times do we have to go over this?

09:05.878 --> 09:07.171
- Until you understand.

09:07.171 --> 09:09.340
- Look, they're here,

09:09.340 --> 09:12.093
they're home, and they're safe.

09:12.093 --> 09:15.346
(tense music)

09:15.346 --> 09:16.180
- Are they?

09:16.180 --> 09:17.014
- Yeah.

09:17.014 --> 09:19.559
Where the hell else are they gonna go?

09:19.559 --> 09:22.311
(paper rustling)

09:29.026 --> 09:30.152
- Anywhere but here.

09:32.363 --> 09:35.449
- You know what, Vincent?

09:36.450 --> 09:37.285
I'm beginning to think

09:37.285 --> 09:38.995
that you don't really understand

09:38.995 --> 09:39.996
what's going on here.

09:39.996 --> 09:41.664
- I understand all too well.

09:41.664 --> 09:43.374
Stop trying to keep them here.

09:43.374 --> 09:44.584
They have free will

09:46.460 --> 09:48.129
and you need to let them move on.

09:50.548 --> 09:51.382
- Okay.

09:55.636 --> 09:57.263
(Mayor sighs)

09:57.263 --> 09:58.806
- Have a good day.

09:58.806 --> 10:00.266
- Thank you.

10:00.266 --> 10:02.768
(eerie music)

10:09.108 --> 10:10.693
- This one's on me.

10:36.302 --> 10:38.179
- [Vincent] Okay.

10:38.179 --> 10:41.182
So, let's pick up right where we left off.

10:44.101 --> 10:46.562
(music warbling)

10:46.562 --> 10:49.190
♪ I'm not getting in my way ♪

10:49.190 --> 10:54.195
♪ I'm getting in my lonely lonely way ♪

10:56.614 --> 11:00.034
♪ And who knows that I hide the things ♪

11:00.034 --> 11:01.702
♪ I want to share with you. ♪

11:01.702 --> 11:04.580
- This is fancy.
- This is cute. Look at this.

11:05.665 --> 11:06.499
(tense music)

11:06.499 --> 11:09.335
(wrench clicking)

11:13.464 --> 11:16.050
(bell dinging)

11:19.553 --> 11:21.013
Look at this.

11:24.392 --> 11:26.018
Hey, get us some drinks, girls.

11:26.018 --> 11:27.353
Have them put 40.

11:28.354 --> 11:30.022
- Okay.
- Pump three.

11:31.649 --> 11:32.983
Put it in there.

11:35.194 --> 11:37.405
Wow, love this thing. Look at that.

11:37.405 --> 11:38.239
Man.

11:41.617 --> 11:42.660
- [Vincent] And this,

11:43.577 --> 11:44.912
this is where we first met.

11:46.997 --> 11:49.417
- I feel like we're on the
edge of the earth out here.

11:49.417 --> 11:52.712
It's more like the to-kill-ya
cook off at this point.

11:54.255 --> 11:55.631
It's like time has stopped.

11:57.049 --> 11:59.135
We can't find our way out.

11:59.135 --> 12:00.094
- Seriously, man?

12:00.928 --> 12:02.888
This trip must be really,
really long for you

12:02.888 --> 12:04.807
if you're coming up with
lame crap like that.

12:06.934 --> 12:08.644
Is that a brontosaurus?

12:08.644 --> 12:10.855
(static crackling)

12:10.855 --> 12:13.524
(flies buzzing)

12:23.701 --> 12:26.120
- I need to put 40 on pump three, please.

12:27.288 --> 12:29.707
- [Cashier] They don't
let me handle the money.

12:29.707 --> 12:31.834
They say I have sticky fingers.

12:31.834 --> 12:34.336
(eerie music)

12:39.717 --> 12:41.260
- Well, what do you girls need?

12:42.970 --> 12:46.432
- Well, we were just asking Wilmer here

12:46.432 --> 12:47.266
if we could have-

12:47.266 --> 12:48.893
- Wilmer doesn't work here anymore.

12:53.481 --> 12:55.524
- Then why does it say Wilmer on his tag?

12:57.735 --> 13:00.488
(Allie chuckles)

13:03.532 --> 13:06.285
Well then, that's a good move on Wilmer.

13:06.285 --> 13:08.871
- Well, it weren't really his choice

13:09.997 --> 13:12.082
being that Wilmer's dead and all.

13:13.000 --> 13:17.588
(eerie music)
(flies buzzing)

13:17.588 --> 13:18.631
- Got any drinks?

13:18.631 --> 13:19.673
- Oh, sure do.

13:21.342 --> 13:26.222
(laughs) Hey, there's
my other set of teeth.

13:26.222 --> 13:27.389
Been wondering where they were,

13:27.389 --> 13:28.557
now here they are.

13:30.267 --> 13:32.061
Well, take what you need.

13:32.061 --> 13:33.979
Our selection is sort of small,

13:33.979 --> 13:36.398
but all we got is real cold.

13:36.398 --> 13:37.817
- I can't believe this is happening.

13:37.817 --> 13:39.401
This is unbelievable.

13:39.401 --> 13:40.361
- Well, cold works.

13:40.361 --> 13:42.488
We need four drinks.
- All right.

13:42.488 --> 13:44.907
- If you got 'em.
- Go ahead.

13:50.079 --> 13:51.539
There you are.

13:51.539 --> 13:52.915
Your four sody-pops.

13:52.915 --> 13:54.458
(Eden laughs)

13:54.458 --> 13:55.751
- Oh my God.

13:56.710 --> 13:59.672
I haven't seen one of
these since I was a kid.

13:59.672 --> 14:00.631
I saw one of these

14:00.631 --> 14:02.258
in those black and white movies

14:02.258 --> 14:03.968
at my Nanny and Poppy's house.

14:05.636 --> 14:08.055
I loved it 'cause it would creep me out.

14:08.055 --> 14:09.473
- [Eden] What is this thing?

14:10.516 --> 14:11.600
- I just remember seeing it

14:11.600 --> 14:13.644
in those old black and white movies.

14:15.229 --> 14:17.481
It would answer yes or no questions.

14:17.481 --> 14:19.400
Tell you your future.

14:19.400 --> 14:20.860
Kind of scary.

14:20.860 --> 14:22.069
- I tell you what.

14:22.069 --> 14:23.571
Sometimes it's best not to know

14:23.571 --> 14:24.780
what your fortune holds.

14:25.614 --> 14:26.574
Leave it alone.

14:29.285 --> 14:30.536
Well, I'll tell you what.

14:34.373 --> 14:36.292
(hand slams)

14:36.292 --> 14:37.126
Or not.

14:38.961 --> 14:40.421
- Come on, let's get out of here, Allie.

14:40.421 --> 14:41.964
- I'm willing to take a chance.

14:43.257 --> 14:44.425
What do I have to lose?

14:46.218 --> 14:48.220
What does our future hold?

14:48.220 --> 14:51.140
- Mm, I thought it answered
only yes or no questions.

14:52.433 --> 14:53.851
Come on, enough of this nonsense.

14:53.851 --> 14:54.685
We gotta roll.

15:01.859 --> 15:04.695
(machine buzzing)

15:08.157 --> 15:10.242
Come on, Allie. Let's go.

15:29.762 --> 15:30.930
- Hey, I'll be right back.

15:30.930 --> 15:31.764
I gotta take a piss

15:31.764 --> 15:33.849
before we get back on
this highway to hell.

15:33.849 --> 15:34.808
- Don't fall in.

15:38.479 --> 15:40.314
- Who says it isn't a highway to heaven?

15:40.314 --> 15:41.649
(eerie music)

15:41.649 --> 15:43.400
- Dude, look around.

15:43.400 --> 15:45.402
If heaven looks anything like this,

15:45.402 --> 15:46.362
I'm not interested.

15:47.571 --> 15:50.115
- Maybe it's more than just a highway.

15:50.115 --> 15:52.618
All depends where you wanna go.

15:52.618 --> 15:55.579
- [Erik] Exactly where is it
that you're looking to go?

15:55.579 --> 15:56.413
- Just Marfa.

15:57.623 --> 15:59.165
- Good luck with that.

15:59.165 --> 16:00.167
We need to get home.

16:02.378 --> 16:03.587
- Good luck to you, too.

16:05.172 --> 16:07.007
I hope that home is where you end up.

16:10.803 --> 16:12.137
- Not sure what that means.

16:13.138 --> 16:14.723
That's exactly where we're headed.

16:19.395 --> 16:21.105
(tense piano music)

16:21.105 --> 16:24.441
- [Matthew] Buddy, do you have orange?

16:24.441 --> 16:25.359
All righty.

16:26.527 --> 16:29.071
Sitting in this here captain's seat.

16:29.071 --> 16:31.907
(voices warbling)

16:35.953 --> 16:39.790
What's this crazy person
doing around here?

16:39.790 --> 16:43.335
I've never seen him before in my life.

16:43.335 --> 16:44.211
They do say that.

16:44.211 --> 16:45.045
- Excuse me.

16:45.045 --> 16:46.422
- [Matthew] Hey, did it all flow well?

16:46.422 --> 16:48.048
Was it good?
- Always.

16:50.551 --> 16:54.471
- Hey, Erik, you still good to drive, man?

16:54.471 --> 16:55.973
- Heck yeah, dude.

16:57.141 --> 16:58.142
- All right.

17:00.310 --> 17:01.729
Bye, dinosaur.
- Let's go.

17:01.729 --> 17:02.688
(bright guitar music)

17:02.688 --> 17:03.731
- [Matthew] Goodbye.

17:03.731 --> 17:04.940
Drive right through it.

17:06.400 --> 17:07.734
Bye, creepy man.

17:12.573 --> 17:16.117

17:16.117 --> 17:18.328

- So, Allie,

17:18.328 --> 17:20.998
I think that guy at the gas
station kinda liked you.

17:20.998 --> 17:23.291
You know, he was totally
flirting with you.

17:23.291 --> 17:25.461
- Wait, wait, wait. What
guy was flirting with you?

17:25.461 --> 17:26.627
- [Matthew] Yeah, what
are y'all talking about?

17:26.627 --> 17:29.673
- Yeah, that cashier was
a straight up creeper.

17:29.673 --> 17:31.467
- Well, if you didn't
dress like a stripper,

17:31.467 --> 17:33.052
men wouldn't be throwing quarters at you.

17:33.052 --> 17:35.262
- I'm not dressed like a stripper.

17:35.262 --> 17:37.264
I don't even have my hair and makeup done.

17:37.264 --> 17:39.183
- Hey, you gotta know where you're at.

17:39.183 --> 17:42.019
I mean, the competitions
pretty weak out here.

17:42.019 --> 17:43.270
- He's right, Allie.

17:43.270 --> 17:44.271
With a body like yours,

17:44.271 --> 17:45.939
you should've gotten
much more than quarters.

17:45.939 --> 17:46.774
- Ew, gross!

17:46.774 --> 17:47.983
(Allie laughs)

17:47.983 --> 17:49.568

18:21.141 --> 18:23.644
with that fortune teller
ticket thing said.

18:23.644 --> 18:24.895
- Whoa, wait a minute.

18:24.895 --> 18:26.021
There's another fortune teller

18:26.021 --> 18:27.231
and you're giving me trouble about mine?

18:27.231 --> 18:28.607
- Yeah, well maybe because yours

18:28.607 --> 18:30.150
is made out of paper.

18:30.150 --> 18:31.193
- [Matthew] It doesn't
matter what it's made out of

18:31.193 --> 18:33.570
as long as it's giving you the
answers you're looking for.

18:33.570 --> 18:34.404
- Okay.

18:34.404 --> 18:35.948
- Wait, wait, was there seriously
a fortune teller in there

18:35.948 --> 18:37.783
or are you just messing with me?

18:37.783 --> 18:41.328
- It was just a stupid toy
sitting on the counter.

18:41.328 --> 18:44.414
I don't wanna think about
that creepy place again.

18:44.414 --> 18:46.458
- You know, speaking of creepy,

18:46.458 --> 18:48.919
my grandmother had a crystal ball.

18:48.919 --> 18:50.587
She would leave it outside on a full moon

18:50.587 --> 18:52.381
claiming it would recharge

18:52.381 --> 18:53.799
and pull energy from Mother Earth.

18:53.799 --> 18:55.050
- Shut up, I don't believe
in all that crazy stuff.

18:55.050 --> 18:56.927
Come on.
- No, seriously.

18:56.927 --> 18:58.428
People would pay her for her predictions.

18:58.428 --> 18:59.972
You know, even local police agencies

18:59.972 --> 19:01.181
would have her profile killers

19:01.181 --> 19:03.392
to help solve crime scenes.

19:03.392 --> 19:05.018
- You believe in all that
crap when you're studying

19:05.018 --> 19:07.187
the scientific approach in forensics?

19:07.187 --> 19:08.522
- What does that even mean?

19:08.522 --> 19:10.274
- Dead men tell a tale.

19:10.274 --> 19:12.317
You know, possibly in more ways than one.

19:12.317 --> 19:14.444
The Indians believed in astral travel.

19:14.444 --> 19:16.446
- I believe in assholes traveling.

19:16.446 --> 19:18.574
We got two in the front
row seats right now.

19:18.574 --> 19:20.701
- [Matthew] Oh, shots fired!

19:20.701 --> 19:22.911
- No, I'm being serious, guys.

19:22.911 --> 19:24.121
Okay, you know when you fall asleep

19:24.121 --> 19:25.706
and your body jumps?
- Yeah.

19:25.706 --> 19:27.374
- Okay, so the Indians believed

19:27.374 --> 19:29.501
that your spirit's
traveling outside your body

19:29.501 --> 19:31.128
and at that very moment
when your body jumps,

19:31.128 --> 19:33.589
your spirit is jumping
right back into your body.

19:38.969 --> 19:40.721
- [Erik] Hey, look.

19:40.721 --> 19:42.472
The Marfa ghost lights.

19:42.472 --> 19:43.849
- [Matthew] I bet that's about as real

19:43.849 --> 19:46.351
as your grandmother's crystal ball.

19:46.351 --> 19:49.271
- [Erik] Hey, maybe we can
stay the night there, huh?

19:49.271 --> 19:51.857
The Marfa sign says it's just up the road.

19:51.857 --> 19:53.192
- [Matthew] Let me consult

19:53.192 --> 19:55.527
with the fortune teller in the car.

19:55.527 --> 19:57.487
(eerie music)

19:57.487 --> 19:58.780
Oh, too bad.

19:58.780 --> 20:01.116
It says that we should not stop.

20:01.116 --> 20:02.409
- Knock it off, Matt.

20:02.409 --> 20:04.745
Quit letting a piece of
paper dictate your future.

20:04.745 --> 20:06.330
- [Matthew] Hey, it was
right about the gas station

20:06.330 --> 20:07.414
and that turned out creepy.

20:07.414 --> 20:08.999
- Okay, so it says Marfa.

20:08.999 --> 20:10.959
It's a town of 2,000.

20:10.959 --> 20:14.922
It has art and culture and
a historical courthouse.

20:14.922 --> 20:15.756
And most importantly,

20:15.756 --> 20:17.466
a place to pull over for the night.

20:18.634 --> 20:21.428
And something about mystery ghost lights.

20:22.471 --> 20:23.263
Whatever.

20:23.263 --> 20:24.389
I say we check things out.

20:26.516 --> 20:27.935
- I'm up for the adventure.

20:27.935 --> 20:28.769
- [Matthew] Okay.

20:28.769 --> 20:30.312
Don't say I didn't warn you not to.

20:31.730 --> 20:34.900
(eerie music)

20:34.900 --> 20:37.277
- Hey, look, it's the guy
from back at the gas station,

20:37.277 --> 20:38.362
the one with the scar.

20:39.696 --> 20:41.281
- How'd he get here before us?

20:41.281 --> 20:42.699
I mean, he said he was
on his way to Marfa,

20:42.699 --> 20:46.453
but he seemed really, real
confused that, you know?

20:47.955 --> 20:49.748
- Well then let's just pick him up.

20:49.748 --> 20:51.625
- See?

20:51.625 --> 20:53.210
We met him for a reason.

20:53.210 --> 20:54.628
He's just another sign telling us

20:54.628 --> 20:56.421
we should go to Marfa.

20:56.421 --> 20:58.465
- I know we shouldn't be
picking up hitchhikers

20:58.465 --> 21:00.300
and he isn't exactly wholesome looking,

21:00.300 --> 21:02.219
but you only live once.

21:02.219 --> 21:03.804
- Fortune teller says that
we should pick him up.

21:03.804 --> 21:05.347
- Not you too.

21:05.347 --> 21:06.431
- [Matthew] I'm just saying, man,

21:06.431 --> 21:08.642
the fortune teller agrees with the ladies.

21:08.642 --> 21:09.893
It must be okay.

21:11.103 --> 21:12.312
- Please?

21:12.312 --> 21:14.064
- [Erik] All right,
well, if we get murdered,

21:14.064 --> 21:15.565
I'm gonna be very upset with all of you.

21:15.565 --> 21:17.442
- Nice turn.
- Yeah.

21:17.442 --> 21:18.694
- [Matthew] Nice turn.

21:18.694 --> 21:21.405
(all cheering)

21:21.405 --> 21:24.491
(wind howling)

21:24.491 --> 21:26.994
(eerie music)

22:02.988 --> 22:03.864
- Hey, get in.

22:03.864 --> 22:04.781
We're heading into town.

22:04.781 --> 22:06.199
- Be glad to join you.

22:07.159 --> 22:08.243
- Whoa.

22:08.243 --> 22:09.536
What in the world was that?

22:09.536 --> 22:10.370
- [Allie] Whoa.

22:13.665 --> 22:14.833
- Welcome to Marfa.

22:22.632 --> 22:23.842
Wanna open the trunk?

around here, aren't they?

24:58.788 --> 25:00.040
- I'm pretty certain

25:00.040 --> 25:01.750
they were waving at the guy behind us.

25:01.750 --> 25:03.376
- Aw, just for a split second

25:03.376 --> 25:04.461
I was thinking we were all important

25:04.461 --> 25:06.254
like a celebrity and all.

25:06.254 --> 25:08.006
- Y'all come on in. Grab a booth.

25:16.681 --> 25:19.059
All right, here we go.

25:19.059 --> 25:21.019
I know it is hot out there.

25:21.019 --> 25:21.853
Okay.

25:21.853 --> 25:24.064
We don't want anybody
dyin' on us around here.

25:24.064 --> 25:25.148
- Well, we're actually on our way home

25:25.148 --> 25:28.151
from that to-kill-ya cook off, you know?

25:28.151 --> 25:29.152
Does that count?

25:29.152 --> 25:30.695
- Stop with the to-kill-ya, would ya?

25:30.695 --> 25:32.030
It wasn't funny the first time.

25:32.030 --> 25:33.490
- So I think we should stay

25:33.490 --> 25:35.075
and check out these lights
everyone's talking about.

25:35.075 --> 25:35.909
- Oh.

25:35.909 --> 25:37.661
Y'all are here to see the lights.

25:37.661 --> 25:38.995
I thought that's why y'all might be here.

25:38.995 --> 25:41.540
(man speaking foreign language)

25:41.540 --> 25:42.374
Shh.

25:43.750 --> 25:45.377
Shh.

25:45.377 --> 25:46.378
I said shh!

25:47.295 --> 25:48.129
Let me tell you something

25:48.129 --> 25:49.089
about those lights.
- There's nothing

25:49.089 --> 25:50.340
to the lights, I'm telling you.

25:50.340 --> 25:51.633
Nothing at all.

25:51.633 --> 25:54.344
- People say that it's
the souls of the dead

25:54.344 --> 25:56.721
that are refusing to just pass on.

25:56.721 --> 25:58.723
You know, they're just hanging out.

25:58.723 --> 26:00.892
- What does that even mean?

26:00.892 --> 26:02.519
- Yeah, really. (laughs)

26:02.519 --> 26:05.480
(man laughing)

26:05.480 --> 26:07.524
- There's nothing to the lights.

26:07.524 --> 26:09.526
Most folks can't even see them.

26:09.526 --> 26:10.986
- Well, those that have

26:12.112 --> 26:14.114
sure think they're beautiful.

26:14.114 --> 26:17.784
(waitress chuckles)

26:17.784 --> 26:19.869
- [Eden] Ma'am, have you
yourself ever seen the lights?

26:19.869 --> 26:21.288
- Oh, honey.

26:21.288 --> 26:22.581
I see them every day.

26:23.790 --> 26:24.874
- She does not.

26:26.710 --> 26:27.961
- I'm with the old guy.

26:27.961 --> 26:30.589
I think it's a hoax or an urban legend.

26:30.589 --> 26:32.382
Every small town in America has one.

26:40.765 --> 26:41.600
- Old guy?

26:43.727 --> 26:44.686
Old guy, huh?

26:46.396 --> 26:49.733
Smells to me like you
drink your own bath water.

26:51.151 --> 26:52.569
Y'all be careful out there.

26:56.573 --> 26:57.574
- All right.

26:59.200 --> 27:02.579
- Okay, here we go.
- Thank you.

27:02.579 --> 27:03.580
- [Waitress] Honey, are you okay?

27:03.580 --> 27:06.458
You look like death warmed over.

27:06.458 --> 27:08.251
And what have you done to your neck?

27:09.628 --> 27:10.754
- [Matthew] Erik.

27:10.754 --> 27:11.963
- [Allie] Let me see, Erik.

27:13.048 --> 27:15.008
It's dried blood. What'd you do?

27:15.884 --> 27:16.843
- I have no idea.

27:18.970 --> 27:20.764
I'll go take a look.

27:24.392 --> 27:25.560
- Matt, I think you oughta drive

27:25.560 --> 27:26.936
the rest of the way home.

27:26.936 --> 27:28.938
Erik isn't looking too good.

27:28.938 --> 27:30.273
- Yeah, I agree.

27:33.568 --> 27:35.320
- So I think we should stay

27:35.320 --> 27:36.696
and check out the lights

27:36.696 --> 27:39.199
and maybe some of the art.

27:39.199 --> 27:41.284
You know, after all, we are here.

27:41.284 --> 27:42.869
- You did say when in Rome, right?

27:42.869 --> 27:45.080
- Oh, Edie, that's so you.

27:45.080 --> 27:46.206
Always so curious,

27:46.206 --> 27:48.208
always wanting the
unexplained explained to you.

27:48.208 --> 27:49.417
- Get off.

27:49.417 --> 27:50.710
(Allie laughs)

27:50.710 --> 27:53.630
(soft eerie music)

27:58.134 --> 28:02.097
- [Vincent] Waiting, watching, listening,

28:03.640 --> 28:05.058
but it's getting late now.

28:12.440 --> 28:13.983
- You again?

28:13.983 --> 28:16.403
Why do we keep bumping into you?

28:16.403 --> 28:17.237
- Who knows?

28:17.237 --> 28:18.655
Maybe our paths were meant to cross.

28:19.572 --> 28:21.574
- Or maybe we were simply meant

28:21.574 --> 28:23.868
to give you a ride into town.

28:23.868 --> 28:24.703
- Could be.

28:26.287 --> 28:27.706
I guess only time will tell.

28:30.917 --> 28:33.753
(water dribbling)

28:40.635 --> 28:43.138
(eerie music)

28:47.100 --> 28:50.103
(dishes clattering)

28:57.485 --> 28:59.654
- I see you're still here.

29:00.572 --> 29:01.406
- For now I am.

29:02.365 --> 29:04.826
- Vincent, I see how you've been preying

29:04.826 --> 29:06.202
on these four young ones.

29:06.202 --> 29:07.829
- I'm not preying on anyone.

29:07.829 --> 29:09.873
- I see what you're doing.

29:09.873 --> 29:13.084
I just want you to just
leave them be, all right?

29:13.084 --> 29:14.085
They belong here.

29:15.462 --> 29:18.131
- They can decide that for themselves

29:18.131 --> 29:20.049
and I'm not gonna stand in their way.

29:20.049 --> 29:21.509
- I don't think you truly understand

29:21.509 --> 29:22.719
what's going on here.

29:23.720 --> 29:25.388
- I don't know what you're talking about.

29:25.388 --> 29:26.765
- You can't change what is.

29:43.323 --> 29:44.324

29:44.324 --> 29:46.242
The Day of the Dead festival

29:46.242 --> 29:48.161
and they got a fat Elvis!

29:48.161 --> 29:50.580
- Well, I guess all
the conspiracy theories

29:50.580 --> 29:53.166
about me being alive are correct.

29:53.166 --> 29:54.834
- Where's your blue suede shoes?

29:54.834 --> 29:56.711
- Oh man, don't be cruel.

29:56.711 --> 29:57.796
(officer laughs)

29:57.796 --> 29:59.547
- You got me all shook up.

- Oh, yep.

30:40.255 --> 30:41.798
They're definitely celebrating the dead.

30:41.798 --> 30:43.675
- Yeah, looks more like
a bunch of freaks to me.

30:43.675 --> 30:44.717
- Come on, Erik.

30:44.717 --> 30:46.052
The King's here.

30:48.847 --> 30:50.890
- I say we get our faces painted.

30:50.890 --> 30:52.851
I mean, there's gotta be face painting.

30:52.851 --> 30:53.893
We should find it.

30:53.893 --> 30:56.104
- What, in this heat? Are you crazy?

30:56.104 --> 30:56.938
- Okay.

30:56.938 --> 31:00.191
So it says DOD is celebrated in Mexico

31:00.191 --> 31:02.402
and around the world in many cultures.

31:02.402 --> 31:03.778
It focuses on the honoring

31:03.778 --> 31:05.905
dead friends and family members.

31:05.905 --> 31:06.739
Oh gosh.

31:07.740 --> 31:09.409
Well, come on, Erik.

31:09.409 --> 31:12.579
This might be our last trip
together as a foursome.

31:12.579 --> 31:13.872
- I think y'all might need some advice

31:13.872 --> 31:14.956
from a fortune teller here.

31:14.956 --> 31:17.959
- Um, we're good.
- Don't count on it, Matt.

31:17.959 --> 31:20.169
You need to put that toy away.

31:20.169 --> 31:21.004
- Fine.

31:21.004 --> 31:22.213
It's not like you're listening to it.

31:22.213 --> 31:24.549
- Are y'all going somewhere
I don't know about?

31:24.549 --> 31:25.508
- Uh, duh.

31:25.508 --> 31:27.010
It's called life.

31:27.010 --> 31:28.428
And before you know it we'll be adulting

31:28.428 --> 31:29.679
and going our separate directions.

31:29.679 --> 31:31.681
- Come on, we've been friends
way too long for that.

31:31.681 --> 31:32.849
You know better.

31:32.849 --> 31:34.851
- Edie has a point about that, Erik.

31:34.851 --> 31:37.478
I mean, maybe it's just time
that the diapers come off,

31:37.478 --> 31:39.147
the training wheels come off.

31:40.273 --> 31:42.358
(sighs) It's gonna happen.

31:42.358 --> 31:43.276
- Speak for yourself.

31:43.276 --> 31:44.819
- Oh yeah, you still wear diapers.

31:44.819 --> 31:46.821
- [Matthew] It just makes life easier.

31:46.821 --> 31:48.239
- I'll visit you at the home.

31:51.200 --> 31:54.454
- Today is one of my
favorite days of the year.

31:54.454 --> 31:56.080
- Oh yeah?

31:56.080 --> 31:57.373
Why's that?

31:57.373 --> 31:59.834
- It feels like I'm
honoring my grandparents,

31:59.834 --> 32:01.711
my ancestors.

32:01.711 --> 32:02.545
- Excuse me, ma'am.

32:02.545 --> 32:04.172
Do you have space for four more?

32:04.172 --> 32:05.882
- [Vincent] Yes, we do.

32:05.882 --> 32:06.716
I'm on it.

32:06.716 --> 32:09.135
I'm gonna get you guys a little DODed.

32:09.135 --> 32:10.011
- DODed?

32:10.011 --> 32:10.929
What does that mean?

32:10.929 --> 32:12.680
- I think it means Day of the Deaded up.

32:12.680 --> 32:13.514
- This is Day of the Dead

32:13.514 --> 32:14.641
not night of the living dead, right?

32:14.641 --> 32:17.352
- Yeah, I'm not so sure
there's a difference.

32:17.352 --> 32:18.895
- Hey, Vincent, it's you.

32:18.895 --> 32:20.271
- Wow, she's really perceptive.

32:20.271 --> 32:21.522
Yes, it is.
- Here we go again.

32:21.522 --> 32:23.775
- I didn't know you were a face painter.

32:23.775 --> 32:25.652
- I didn't know I was
gonna be working today.

32:25.652 --> 32:26.986
- [Erik] What do you mean by that?

32:26.986 --> 32:28.321
(gentle piano music)

32:28.321 --> 32:29.948
- Yes.

32:29.948 --> 32:31.824
We must always remember.

32:31.824 --> 32:32.659
- Exactly.

32:34.744 --> 32:35.578
- Uh, just that,

32:36.746 --> 32:38.998
I was gonna pay you back
for giving me a ride.

32:38.998 --> 32:40.833
- [Erik] Gee, thanks.

32:40.833 --> 32:41.668
- You're welcome.

32:50.385 --> 32:51.594
- [Little Girl] What's wrong?

32:53.972 --> 32:54.806
- Nothing.

33:00.395 --> 33:01.312
- Come on, come on.

33:01.312 --> 33:02.271
You got four of us to work on.

33:02.271 --> 33:04.023
- I'm all over it.

33:04.023 --> 33:06.109
Just gotta make sure it's done right.

33:06.109 --> 33:07.026
Look the other way.

33:08.194 --> 33:09.028
That way.

33:09.028 --> 33:09.862
- Oh.

33:09.862 --> 33:10.697
Hey.

33:11.990 --> 33:12.824
- [Vincent] Why do you have three eyes?

33:12.824 --> 33:14.325
Hold on a second.

33:14.325 --> 33:15.535
- It's Marfa. Hello?

33:17.412 --> 33:22.208
♪ That I cast a spell when
I looked in his eyes ♪

33:22.208 --> 33:27.213

33:27.296 --> 33:32.301

33:41.936 --> 33:46.024

33:46.024 --> 33:47.525
- I see a troubled past.

33:52.238 --> 33:54.407
You're carrying a heavy burden.

33:54.407 --> 33:57.160
(dramatic music)

34:01.748 --> 34:03.082
- Well, who doesn't?

34:04.167 --> 34:05.918
Come on, where's your skills at?

34:10.630 --> 34:14.802
- I see you've put your
friend's lives in great danger.

34:14.802 --> 34:16.344
And they don't know, do they?

34:19.139 --> 34:20.725
And neither do you.

34:23.393 --> 34:24.771
Look inside yourself.

34:24.771 --> 34:25.938
Find your spirit.

34:27.482 --> 34:28.440
Confront him.

34:29.650 --> 34:31.194
And only then will you have the answer

34:31.194 --> 34:32.820
that will truly set you free.

34:34.906 --> 34:37.283
Live for today and tomorrow never comes.

34:40.078 --> 34:41.621
- I wonder if she has Saturday's

34:41.621 --> 34:43.081
winning lottery numbers, huh?

35:00.389 --> 35:01.682
- But I want a picture.

35:03.476 --> 35:04.435
Say Marfa.

35:05.561 --> 35:06.395
- Marfa.

35:14.529 --> 35:15.988
- Hey.

35:15.988 --> 35:17.490
Okay, so it's Matt's pocket,

35:18.533 --> 35:20.451
gas stations, and gypsy booths.

35:21.619 --> 35:23.121
They're everywhere.

35:23.121 --> 35:24.997
I feel like we're in a traveling circus.

35:24.997 --> 35:26.249
It's like revenge of the fortune tellers.

35:26.249 --> 35:28.835
(Allie laughs)

35:29.836 --> 35:32.338
(tense music)

35:50.565 --> 35:51.399
- Man.

35:52.567 --> 35:54.318
How are we gonna get this crap off?

35:55.570 --> 35:58.906
- Nothing a little turpentine
and steel wool can't remove.

35:58.906 --> 36:01.325
- Um, you might not like your face.

36:01.325 --> 36:02.869
I however, am attached to mine.

36:04.245 --> 36:05.246
- Man, I'm wore out.

36:06.497 --> 36:07.790
Too much sun or something.

36:09.125 --> 36:10.251
- Take a hot shower.

36:11.752 --> 36:12.670
You'll feel better.

36:13.588 --> 36:15.131
You'll definitely smell better.

36:19.343 --> 36:21.846
(Allie sighs)

37:00.718 --> 37:02.386
- Anyone got service?

37:02.386 --> 37:03.763
I got nothing on this thing.

37:04.847 --> 37:08.851
- Matt, we're lucky we
got water and electricity.

37:08.851 --> 37:11.103
- Surely they have wifi
here though, come on.

37:12.104 --> 37:13.814
- You want some room service with that?

37:13.814 --> 37:15.441
- [Matthew] Yes, please.

37:15.441 --> 37:16.275
You never know.

37:17.151 --> 37:19.362
Hey Edie, why don't you
call the front desk,

37:19.362 --> 37:20.363
ask if they got some wifi,

37:20.363 --> 37:21.364
get us the password?

37:22.949 --> 37:24.325
- [Woman On TV] They oughta
make the day and the time

37:24.325 --> 37:26.661
change on the first day of summer.

37:26.661 --> 37:29.205
- [Eden] Yes, could you
tell me the wifi password?

37:29.205 --> 37:30.665
- You can't be serious, Edie.

37:35.002 --> 37:37.505
- [Mysterious Voice] It's because of you.

37:37.505 --> 37:39.257
Go to the lights.

37:39.257 --> 37:40.091
- Y'all quit!

37:41.509 --> 37:42.551
Quit messing with me.

37:47.640 --> 37:50.268
- I heard them pick up and
now I can't hear anything.

37:51.102 --> 37:52.728
- [Man On TV] Is there
any of that candy left?

37:52.728 --> 37:53.938
- Well, you called it, Allie.

37:53.938 --> 37:55.022
They don't have a phone that works,

37:55.022 --> 37:56.107
let alone internet service.

37:56.107 --> 37:58.317
- We still remember.
- I don't.

38:02.321 --> 38:04.490
- [Mysterious Voice] Erik.

38:06.784 --> 38:08.119
- Oh.

38:08.119 --> 38:11.414
Dude, I haven't seen you move
that fast in a long time.

38:11.414 --> 38:13.291
- [Allie] I take it the
shower didn't help any.

38:13.291 --> 38:14.875
- Something's not right.

38:14.875 --> 38:16.460
I'm not feeling well.

38:16.460 --> 38:17.503
- Maybe it has something to do

38:17.503 --> 38:20.589
with that foot long sausage
on a stick you had earlier.

38:20.589 --> 38:21.882
- That's real funny.

38:21.882 --> 38:23.759
- [Mathew] I'm just saying.

38:23.759 --> 38:24.593
I'm just saying, man.

38:24.593 --> 38:26.387
Come on, put some clothes on, would ya?

38:26.387 --> 38:27.513
- We've had a long few days.

38:27.513 --> 38:28.889
We're all just tired.

38:28.889 --> 38:29.724
- I'm not sick or tired.

38:29.724 --> 38:31.851
I just...

38:31.851 --> 38:34.437
I don't feel like myself at all.

38:34.437 --> 38:35.813
- All right.

38:35.813 --> 38:37.898
We'll leave first thing tomorrow morning.

38:38.774 --> 38:40.276
Come on, the paper fortune teller

38:40.276 --> 38:42.028
told us we shouldn't
even be here, all right?

38:42.028 --> 38:43.654
We should've listened to it.

38:43.654 --> 38:45.114
- Matt, I'm gonna shove that thing

38:45.114 --> 38:46.282
where the sun don't shine.

38:46.282 --> 38:47.366
- I'm just saying.

38:50.745 --> 38:51.746
- We can't just leave without seeing

38:51.746 --> 38:53.622
what those ghost lights are all about.

38:56.917 --> 38:58.336
- Are you sure?

38:58.336 --> 39:00.671
We don't have to see the ghosts lights.

39:00.671 --> 39:02.173
If you're not feeling well,

39:02.173 --> 39:04.091
we can go home in the morning.

39:04.091 --> 39:05.760
- If we didn't see those darn lights,

39:05.760 --> 39:06.844
you'd drive the whole way home

39:06.844 --> 39:09.638
while being this close
and not seeing them?

39:10.598 --> 39:11.932
I'd rather see them sick as a dog

39:11.932 --> 39:13.267
than watch you pout the whole way home.

39:13.267 --> 39:15.019
- I wouldn't pout the whole way home.

39:15.019 --> 39:16.604
(Allie chuckles)

39:16.604 --> 39:18.230
Like maybe half of it.

39:18.230 --> 39:20.733
- And from every trip on.

39:20.733 --> 39:21.901
Edie, you and I both know

39:21.901 --> 39:23.527
as soon as those Christmas lights come on,

39:23.527 --> 39:24.862
you're gonna get triggered.

39:25.946 --> 39:27.823
Those traffic lights are gonna change

39:27.823 --> 39:28.991
and you're just gonna think about

39:28.991 --> 39:31.369
all of the Marfa lights you're missing.

39:31.369 --> 39:33.329
(Allie and Erik laughing)

39:33.329 --> 39:34.205
- [Man On TV] I wonder what happened

39:34.205 --> 39:36.582
to the one from last year.

39:36.582 --> 39:39.293
Each year we spend good
money on these things.

39:39.293 --> 39:41.796
(eerie music)

39:45.257 --> 39:48.052
- Well, well, who do we have here?

39:50.805 --> 39:51.639
- Who?

39:53.808 --> 39:57.061
- It's the two cashiers
from the gas station,

39:57.061 --> 39:59.313
but there's a third guy
standing beside them.

40:00.731 --> 40:01.857
He must be Wilmer.

40:03.025 --> 40:05.319
He's actually wearing
his own shirt this time.

40:07.738 --> 40:09.490
- Why is a picture of them in here?

- [Allie] It's so dark out here.

42:11.529 --> 42:15.533
At this point any bit of
light would be welcome.

42:15.533 --> 42:18.410
- Yeah, I'm not really
expecting to see any lights.

42:18.410 --> 42:19.703
And if we do,

42:19.703 --> 42:21.622
I'm honestly not
expecting them to be much.

42:21.622 --> 42:22.456
- Who cares?

42:22.456 --> 42:24.458
It's not like we'd be doing anything else.

42:25.292 --> 42:28.128
- You mean, other than standing
in the middle of nowhere?

42:30.631 --> 42:32.424
- Guys, let's just give it a minute, okay?

42:32.424 --> 42:34.677
It's got me really curious.

42:34.677 --> 42:35.678
- Ooh.

42:35.678 --> 42:37.805
- [Man In The Dark] Give it some time.

42:37.805 --> 42:39.723
I've given it years.

42:41.183 --> 42:43.477
When you're ready for them

42:43.477 --> 42:44.436
you'll see them.

42:45.396 --> 42:46.772
- What the heck?

42:46.772 --> 42:50.609
- Uh, God, is that you?

42:50.609 --> 42:51.735
(eerie music)

42:51.735 --> 42:53.362
- Okay, what's going on?

42:53.362 --> 42:54.822
We can't even see who we're talking to.

42:54.822 --> 42:56.949
- [Man In The Dark] The point is

42:56.949 --> 42:58.826
it doesn't even matter who I am.

42:59.827 --> 43:03.289
Just be open and willing to listen.

43:03.289 --> 43:06.041
- Your ability to attract
weirdos is unparalleled.

43:06.041 --> 43:08.168
I've literally never
seen anything like it.

43:08.168 --> 43:09.420
- [Man In The Dark] There's
more to these lights

43:09.420 --> 43:11.255
than we see,

43:11.255 --> 43:13.549
more than we know or willing to accept.

43:14.383 --> 43:16.719
Most can't see them and those few who do

43:16.719 --> 43:19.430
can't begin to explain them.

43:19.430 --> 43:21.849
Maybe they're here to guide us,

43:21.849 --> 43:24.351
to help us take a step back,

43:24.351 --> 43:26.895
and think about the big picture,

43:26.895 --> 43:31.567
that everything has a
beginning and an end.

43:33.360 --> 43:34.361
- Okay.

43:34.361 --> 43:36.822
I'll take that as your
opinion and nothing else.

43:36.822 --> 43:38.949
- [Man In The Dark] Maybe or maybe not.

43:41.327 --> 43:43.871
The light shines in the darkness

43:43.871 --> 43:46.749
and the darkness has never understood it.

43:47.791 --> 43:48.751
You're searching.

43:49.793 --> 43:51.670
You all came here for a reason.

43:52.796 --> 43:53.631
Be patient.

43:54.923 --> 43:56.842
You'll see them soon enough.

43:58.093 --> 43:59.428
- [Matthew] What does that even mean?

43:59.428 --> 44:00.679
- Exactly, Matt.

44:00.679 --> 44:03.515
What the heck does that even mean?

44:03.515 --> 44:05.726
Oh, wait.

44:06.727 --> 44:08.687
Do you mean those lights out there?

44:08.687 --> 44:09.605
- [Erik] Shut up, Allie.

44:09.605 --> 44:11.899
He's trying to tell us something.

44:11.899 --> 44:13.317
- Okay, Allie, look,

44:13.317 --> 44:14.151
you know as well as I do

44:14.151 --> 44:15.235
that those lights you're pointing at

44:15.235 --> 44:16.820
are a bunch of idiots on
their cell phones, okay?

44:16.820 --> 44:17.655
It's not funny.

44:27.081 --> 44:29.583
Do you guys remember
what that waitress said?

44:29.583 --> 44:30.417
- [Allie] What?

44:32.336 --> 44:35.172
- Something about souls

44:35.172 --> 44:37.132
and them refusing to move on

44:37.132 --> 44:38.217
and them hanging out.

44:39.718 --> 44:41.011
- [Matthew] Oh, right.

44:41.011 --> 44:43.639
Yeah, she was talking about
the souls of the dead, right?

44:43.639 --> 44:45.808
- Yeah. That's, that's it.

44:48.018 --> 44:50.854
- [Man In The Dark] For one
to be open to a new beginning,

44:50.854 --> 44:54.274
one must first come to
terms with one's end.

44:54.274 --> 44:55.609
- Wait!

44:55.609 --> 44:56.860
I just saw something.

44:56.860 --> 44:57.695
- [Eden] Where?

44:57.695 --> 44:58.612
- Like over there on the right.

44:58.612 --> 45:00.906
Kind of over the horizon.

45:00.906 --> 45:03.200
It's kind of like they're floating.

45:03.200 --> 45:05.869
- Oh my God. I see them too.

45:05.869 --> 45:08.539
(eerie music)

45:08.539 --> 45:09.373
- Wait.

45:09.373 --> 45:10.207
No, I see it too.

45:10.207 --> 45:11.333
It's right over there.

45:13.293 --> 45:14.128
- Wow.

45:15.087 --> 45:16.922
Are those the Marfa lights
everyone's talking about?

45:16.922 --> 45:18.507
- Well, there's nothing else out that way.

45:18.507 --> 45:20.008
What else could it be?

45:20.008 --> 45:21.093
- How do we know it's not a highway

45:21.093 --> 45:23.470
with a bunch of cars on
it off in the distance?

45:23.470 --> 45:24.346
- There's only one way to find out.

45:24.346 --> 45:27.266
- Erik, what the heck?
Where are you going?

45:27.266 --> 45:29.309
- I'm gonna track these lights down.

45:29.309 --> 45:31.145
I bet you someone's screwing with us.

45:31.145 --> 45:32.438
- Erik, you're nuts!

45:32.438 --> 45:34.481
I mean, it's pitch black out there.

45:34.481 --> 45:36.150
You don't know what you're stepping on.

45:36.150 --> 45:37.860
- Erik, I'm with ya. I'm coming too!

45:37.860 --> 45:39.403
- Matt!

45:39.403 --> 45:40.821
- [Matthew] Erik!

45:43.824 --> 45:44.992
What are you doing?

45:44.992 --> 45:48.328
(electricity crackling)

45:53.333 --> 45:54.168
- Erik.

45:55.878 --> 45:57.463
Erik, are you okay?

45:59.965 --> 46:01.675
(heartbeat pounding)

46:01.675 --> 46:04.219
(lights sparking)

46:04.219 --> 46:07.639
(Erik breathing heavily)

46:18.442 --> 46:20.194
- What just happened?

46:22.613 --> 46:23.947
- Erik.

46:23.947 --> 46:27.367
(soft tense piano music)

46:38.504 --> 46:41.006
(eerie music)

47:03.362 --> 47:06.448
- You know, people in
Marfa talk in circles.

47:06.448 --> 47:07.699
No, not circles.

47:07.699 --> 47:09.034
Soliloquies.

47:09.034 --> 47:12.162
Some kind of poetic
verse you can't under...

47:47.322 --> 47:48.657
Hey, are you okay?

47:49.908 --> 47:50.742
- I guess.

47:54.288 --> 47:55.539
- So, I've been thinking.

47:59.042 --> 47:59.877
- Yeah?

48:01.295 --> 48:03.505
- Allie and I went to the store today

48:03.505 --> 48:05.841
and bought gemstones, a crystal ball,

48:05.841 --> 48:09.511
talked about astral travel and taro cards-

48:09.511 --> 48:10.929
- Yeah, and?

48:10.929 --> 48:11.763
- And,

48:13.974 --> 48:17.019
since being here you've had
some guy following us around,

48:17.895 --> 48:20.355
a gypsy tried to tell you your fortune,

48:20.355 --> 48:21.189
you've been hearing someone

48:21.189 --> 48:22.524
whispering to you in the shower,

48:22.524 --> 48:24.693
and now you've been
knocked over by lights.

48:24.693 --> 48:25.903
- Yeah, tell me about it.

48:29.823 --> 48:31.033
What are you getting at?

48:36.330 --> 48:37.456
- I think...

48:43.670 --> 48:44.796
I think there's some kind of

48:44.796 --> 48:46.465
spellbound curse on this town.

48:48.675 --> 48:51.720
Maybe voodoo or witchcraft

48:51.720 --> 48:52.971
and the list can keep on

48:52.971 --> 48:54.181
but you get my point.

48:55.432 --> 48:56.266
- And?

48:58.727 --> 49:00.187
- I gotta show you something.

49:01.563 --> 49:02.981
I discovered this just a few minutes ago,

49:02.981 --> 49:05.525
so no one else has seen
this and no one else knows.

49:07.069 --> 49:08.320
- Okay.

49:08.320 --> 49:09.321
- I was going over the photos

49:09.321 --> 49:10.614
I've taken over the course of this trip

49:10.614 --> 49:14.701
and I gotta show you the
one of you with that gypsy.

49:15.869 --> 49:17.329
I think that's where
this whole mess started.

49:17.329 --> 49:18.163
It's with her.

49:18.163 --> 49:19.581
- Well you take pictures and videos

49:19.581 --> 49:20.666
of everything and everyone.

49:20.666 --> 49:22.584
So, I'm not surprised.

49:23.669 --> 49:24.503
- Okay.

49:27.547 --> 49:29.925
Okay, so remember sitting down with her?

49:29.925 --> 49:31.051
- Yes, of course I do.

49:32.052 --> 49:34.429
- And remember how weird she was?

49:34.429 --> 49:35.263
- Yeah.

49:37.766 --> 49:39.559
- Okay, take a look at this picture.

49:44.940 --> 49:45.774
See anything?

49:55.617 --> 49:56.451
- Yeah.

49:57.577 --> 49:59.413
I see two chairs in a booth.

49:59.413 --> 50:00.414
- Yeah.
- What about it?

50:00.414 --> 50:02.708
- Maybe I should've asked
you what you don't see.

50:07.295 --> 50:08.130
- I'm not following. Just tell me.

50:08.130 --> 50:09.464
- What you don't see, Erik,

50:09.464 --> 50:11.967
is neither of you two
sitting in those two chairs.

50:13.051 --> 50:14.469
You're not in your chair

50:14.469 --> 50:15.595
and the gypsy isn't in hers,

50:15.595 --> 50:17.681
but you know as well as
I do y'all were both,

50:17.681 --> 50:19.266
you were both in those two chairs.

50:19.266 --> 50:20.934
- [Erik] So what?

50:20.934 --> 50:21.768
- So what?

50:21.768 --> 50:23.145
So I'm telling you, I know
you were in this picture

50:23.145 --> 50:23.979
when I took it, okay?

50:23.979 --> 50:26.273
Just, just trust me on this.

50:26.273 --> 50:27.524
- Okay, I mean.

50:30.068 --> 50:30.986
I thought I was.

50:32.571 --> 50:34.656
But that doesn't mean the timing was off.

50:34.656 --> 50:35.782
Maybe you took the picture when we got up.

50:35.782 --> 50:37.659
- Just take my word for it, Erik.

50:39.161 --> 50:40.370
You know that gypsy never got up

50:40.370 --> 50:41.580
the entire time we were there.

50:41.580 --> 50:42.456
So explain that.

50:45.834 --> 50:46.668
- Okay.

50:48.503 --> 50:50.213
Where are you going with all this?

50:51.548 --> 50:54.718
- Erik, that gypsy cast a spell on you.

50:55.969 --> 50:59.514
(Erik chuckling)

50:59.514 --> 51:00.348
- Are you serious?

51:00.348 --> 51:01.933
- I'm being dead serious, Erik.

51:01.933 --> 51:03.852
You've been weird ever since then.

51:03.852 --> 51:07.397
I mean, above and beyond your
normal realm of weirdness,

51:07.397 --> 51:09.024
which is really, really weird.

51:09.024 --> 51:11.068
- Okay, okay.

51:11.068 --> 51:14.446
Look, you have my attention.

51:14.446 --> 51:15.739
- Oh, well that's a start.

51:18.325 --> 51:20.118
Let's keep this between you and I.

51:20.118 --> 51:20.994
Okay?

51:20.994 --> 51:22.204
Let's get our facts a little straighter

51:22.204 --> 51:23.830
before we clue the other two in.

51:24.706 --> 51:25.540
- Okay.

51:26.750 --> 51:27.959
I'm not sold on this theory

51:27.959 --> 51:31.505
just because of a picture
you took of two empty chairs.

51:31.505 --> 51:34.382
And we're leaving tomorrow anyway, so.

51:35.425 --> 51:37.886
(tense music)

51:53.068 --> 51:55.821
(crow squawking)

52:06.790 --> 52:08.458
- [Allie] Oh, don't worry. I saw that.

52:08.458 --> 52:09.292
- You saw that?
- Mm-hmm.

52:09.292 --> 52:11.044
- Oh hey, look who's headed this way.

52:12.129 --> 52:13.255
- It's the freaks from the gas station.

52:13.255 --> 52:14.798
- [Eden] Mm-hmm.

52:14.798 --> 52:16.758
- [Allie] I mean, look at his clothes.

52:16.758 --> 52:18.385
- Wilmer?
- Yeah, Wilmer!

52:18.385 --> 52:21.263
- Shh, he might hear you, Allie.

52:21.263 --> 52:22.639
- Do you think it matters?

52:22.639 --> 52:25.642
I mean, if we actually ran

52:25.642 --> 52:27.227
do you think they'd actually catch up?

52:27.227 --> 52:28.353
- Yeah, no joke.

52:28.353 --> 52:30.105
That one dude is still rolling around

52:30.105 --> 52:32.607
on his little cooler thingy-ma-jig.

52:32.607 --> 52:34.734
- Okay, is thingy-ma-jig even a real word?

52:34.734 --> 52:35.902
- It is when you have no other words

52:35.902 --> 52:37.529
to describe that thing.

52:37.529 --> 52:38.363
- Yeah, I have a word for you.

52:38.363 --> 52:40.407
Wacko, straight up wack jobs.

52:40.407 --> 52:43.076
And don't ask me if
that's a real word, Eden.

52:43.076 --> 52:45.120
I'm pretty sure it's still
in the urban dictionary.

52:45.120 --> 52:46.538
- No, I'm with you, Allie.

52:46.538 --> 52:48.665
It definitely fits both of them.

52:48.665 --> 52:49.499
- Yeah.

52:49.499 --> 52:51.251
It's probably safe to say

52:51.251 --> 52:53.962
that their antennas aren't
picking up all the channels.

52:53.962 --> 52:55.172
- More like nothing at all.

52:55.172 --> 52:56.006
- Shut up, guys.

52:56.006 --> 52:57.257
They are way too close

52:57.257 --> 52:58.592
for y'all to be talking this loud.

52:58.592 --> 53:00.969
- Do you think it matters?

53:12.647 --> 53:14.024
- They really are creepy, man.

53:14.024 --> 53:15.859
I'm so glad they didn't engage.

53:15.859 --> 53:17.277
- [Erik] Shoot, we're
lucky they didn't hear us.

53:17.277 --> 53:18.111
- It's so creepy.

53:18.111 --> 53:19.362
They didn't even say anything at all.

53:19.362 --> 53:22.991
- Yeah, they were definitely
in their own little worlds.

53:22.991 --> 53:24.534
Hey, don't turn around.

53:24.534 --> 53:26.369
Don't even look at those guys again.

53:27.579 --> 53:28.496
- Okay, was it just me

53:28.496 --> 53:30.790
or did that guy have Wilmer's shirt on?

53:32.083 --> 53:34.336
I mean, that's pretty weird, guys.

53:34.336 --> 53:35.837
Totally cray-cray.

53:35.837 --> 53:37.505
- Why are they even here anyway?

53:37.505 --> 53:38.506
They don't really seem like the type

53:38.506 --> 53:40.467
to just be walking around for exercise.

53:40.467 --> 53:42.052
- Who honestly cares?

53:42.052 --> 53:43.595
- Okay, now let's not get
all sentimental about it.

53:43.595 --> 53:45.096
- Yeah, let's not.

53:46.181 --> 53:47.224
I have an appetite.

53:47.224 --> 53:48.934
I wanna eat and get out of Marfa.

53:51.686 --> 53:54.397
(Allie groans)

53:54.397 --> 53:57.150
(paper rustling)

53:59.861 --> 54:00.654
- Hey Tux Man,

54:02.447 --> 54:04.366
can I have a BLT please?

54:04.366 --> 54:05.200
- A what?

54:05.200 --> 54:06.076
- A BLT?

54:07.077 --> 54:10.622
- Uh, I guess we can make
you one without the B.

54:10.622 --> 54:11.831
- What's the B, Tux Man?

54:12.666 --> 54:14.334
- The B is for bacon, kid.

54:15.585 --> 54:17.796
- [Little Boy] So just
lettuce and tomato, Tux Man?

54:17.796 --> 54:18.880
No bacon?

54:18.880 --> 54:20.173
- That's what I'm saying, kid.

54:20.173 --> 54:21.591
That's what I'm saying.

54:21.591 --> 54:23.593
- What kind of sandwich is that?

54:23.593 --> 54:25.136
- One with no bacon.

54:25.136 --> 54:26.596
I got a kebab.

54:26.596 --> 54:28.265
I got hummus.

54:28.265 --> 54:30.350
But I can't make you a BLT.

54:30.350 --> 54:31.851
I ain't got it.

54:31.851 --> 54:34.354
You're gonna have to pick
something else out, kid.

54:35.563 --> 54:38.149
(wind howling)

55:15.395 --> 55:18.106
- That cute kid wanted
his BLT pretty badly, huh?

55:18.106 --> 55:20.984
- Yeah, I guess he didn't get
this place has a fancy menu.

55:23.320 --> 55:24.154
- [Eden] So do you guys think

55:24.154 --> 55:27.324
that man in the dark the
other night was Wilmer?

55:27.324 --> 55:28.491
Look, he didn't deny it.

55:28.491 --> 55:29.617
- Who cares?

55:29.617 --> 55:31.411
- Eden's right, though.

55:31.411 --> 55:33.663
I've been wondering the same thing.

55:33.663 --> 55:34.831
- I wouldn't think twice about it

55:34.831 --> 55:37.792
if everyone else here wasn't so weird.

55:37.792 --> 55:39.169
- [Matthew] Yeah.

55:39.169 --> 55:40.128
I think this whole town is getting to us.

55:40.128 --> 55:41.880
- Which is exactly why we're eating

55:41.880 --> 55:43.340
and getting back on the road.

55:44.299 --> 55:45.967
Goodbye, Marfa!

55:45.967 --> 55:47.344
(whistles) Out of here.

55:49.471 --> 55:51.681
- Have any of y'all thought about

55:51.681 --> 55:52.807
having a bucket list?

55:53.767 --> 55:55.602
You know, things you wanna
accomplish before you die?

55:55.602 --> 55:57.354
- [Erik] Bucket list?

55:57.354 --> 55:59.981
Come on, that's for folks dodging coffins.

55:59.981 --> 56:01.316
I haven't even started my life yet.

56:01.316 --> 56:02.734
I'm barely 20 years old.

56:04.486 --> 56:05.987
- Well seeing how bad you look

56:07.280 --> 56:08.990
and that curse the gypsy put on you,

56:08.990 --> 56:12.786
I'd say you start thinking
bucket list pretty soon, buddy.

56:12.786 --> 56:15.663
- [Eden] You know, I told
him the exact same thing.

56:15.663 --> 56:17.040
- [Allie] How do you mean?

56:17.040 --> 56:18.416
- Just that the gypsy either cursed him

56:18.416 --> 56:19.292
or cast a spell on him.

56:19.292 --> 56:20.877
- Hey, come on now.

56:21.961 --> 56:23.922
- Or we could just drop all that and eat.

56:25.382 --> 56:26.925
- Sorry for bringing something up

56:26.925 --> 56:28.676
most folks would get excited about.

56:29.552 --> 56:32.639
- So you bring up what we
wanna do before we die?

56:32.639 --> 56:33.932
Yeah. No, thank you.

56:35.683 --> 56:38.520
- [Allie] Y'all need to
chill out a whole lot.

56:38.520 --> 56:41.231
(sirens wailing)

56:44.734 --> 56:46.444
- [Eden] Where do you think they're going?

56:46.444 --> 56:49.572
- [Erik] Let's go see what's going on.

57:03.420 --> 57:04.879
- They seem to like it here.

57:06.464 --> 57:07.590
(eerie music)

57:07.590 --> 57:08.800
- [Vincent] You think so?

57:08.800 --> 57:09.843
- Yeah, I do.

57:10.844 --> 57:12.178
I think they're gonna stay.

57:13.721 --> 57:14.556
How about you?

57:15.932 --> 57:17.434
You still planning on leaving?

57:18.601 --> 57:19.602
- What do you think?

57:20.728 --> 57:22.397
- I think that you're confused.

57:23.481 --> 57:25.817
I think you don't know
where you should be.

57:29.487 --> 57:30.655
Look out there, Vincent.

57:32.031 --> 57:32.866
What do you see?

57:34.909 --> 57:35.910
Where are you gonna go?

57:35.910 --> 57:37.954
What are you gonna do when you get there?

57:38.872 --> 57:40.457
When are you gonna understand

57:41.749 --> 57:43.126
that you belong here?

57:46.129 --> 57:47.005
- No, I don't.

57:48.339 --> 57:49.632
- Come on, Vincent.

57:51.092 --> 57:53.970
Vincent, why don't you stick around, huh?

57:53.970 --> 57:55.054
I need you, Vincent.

57:56.264 --> 57:57.974
We gotta keep everybody in line, man.

57:57.974 --> 57:59.350
I need you.

57:59.350 --> 58:00.143
Vincent!

58:01.769 --> 58:03.438
- [Vincent] It's getting late now.

58:14.991 --> 58:16.367
Choosing the right moment.

58:17.952 --> 58:21.039
That, that's what it comes down to.

58:21.039 --> 58:23.625
(wind howling)

58:24.667 --> 58:26.336
- I told you all someone
needed help, didn't I?

58:26.336 --> 58:27.712
- Oh my God.

58:27.712 --> 58:28.963
- I wonder what happened.

58:29.881 --> 58:31.341
I only see one car.

58:31.341 --> 58:32.175
- Yeah.

58:32.175 --> 58:33.468
It looks like it just rolled over.

58:34.385 --> 58:38.181
Maybe the driver fell asleep or something.

58:38.181 --> 58:39.682
- Oh, goodness.

58:39.682 --> 58:41.684
Any idea what happened?

58:41.684 --> 58:42.894
- No.

58:42.894 --> 58:45.480
(thunder crashing)

58:45.480 --> 58:48.816
(electricity crackling)

58:50.610 --> 58:53.321
- Erik, are you okay?
- Erik!

58:53.321 --> 58:54.656
(tires screeching)
(girls screaming)

58:54.656 --> 58:59.619
(glass shattering)
(Erik breathing heavily)

59:06.042 --> 59:06.876
- Deja vu.

59:12.966 --> 59:15.468
- [Allie] Let me see, Erik.

59:15.468 --> 59:16.302
- What?

59:25.270 --> 59:28.022
(sign squeaking)

59:31.401 --> 59:32.610
- I've been here before.

59:35.238 --> 59:36.072
- Erik.

59:37.740 --> 59:38.616
That's your car.

59:40.118 --> 59:41.995
That's the car that we were riding in.

59:52.922 --> 59:55.633
(sirens wailing)

59:58.261 --> 59:59.804
- [Eden] Where do you think they're going?

59:59.804 --> 1:00:02.974
- [Erik] Let's go see what's going on.

1:00:11.107 --> 1:00:14.027
(tires screeching)

1:00:15.486 --> 1:00:18.031
(car crashing)

1:00:31.210 --> 1:00:33.963
(sirens wailing)

1:00:46.059 --> 1:00:47.560
- [Paramedic] We've got people in here.

1:00:47.560 --> 1:00:49.020
I have no vitals.

1:00:49.020 --> 1:00:49.979
- I think I get it.

1:00:51.731 --> 1:00:53.107
- Get what, Erik?

1:00:54.651 --> 1:00:55.652
- [Mysterious Voice] Erik.

1:00:55.652 --> 1:00:58.404
- [Norman] That is your car, Erik.

1:01:00.198 --> 1:01:01.908
- You're the man from the bar.

1:01:01.908 --> 1:01:04.494
(jaunty music)

1:01:07.747 --> 1:01:10.750
- Oh, your perceptive
capabilities are just astounding.

1:01:14.712 --> 1:01:18.091
(Norman humming "Entry of the Gladiators")

1:01:18.091 --> 1:01:18.925
You, sir.

1:01:21.886 --> 1:01:23.179
You've been here already.

1:01:23.179 --> 1:01:25.390
And you, Erik,

1:01:26.391 --> 1:01:28.351
you've definitely been here before.

1:01:29.936 --> 1:01:33.398
(Norman humming "Entry of the Gladiators")

1:01:33.398 --> 1:01:36.442
(heartbeat pounding)

1:01:48.538 --> 1:01:49.372
- [Matthew] Erik.

1:01:49.372 --> 1:01:51.207
- [Allie] Let me see, Erik.

1:01:51.207 --> 1:01:53.668
(tires screeching)

1:01:53.668 --> 1:01:55.461
(somber music)

1:01:55.461 --> 1:01:56.921
- [Waitress] He's right.

1:01:56.921 --> 1:01:58.423
You all have been here before.

1:02:00.717 --> 1:02:01.968
- I need you guys to back up.

1:02:01.968 --> 1:02:03.928
I want you guys to back up.

1:02:03.928 --> 1:02:05.555
Come on, guys. You need to back up.

1:02:07.557 --> 1:02:10.184
- [Eden] What? No, no.

1:02:10.184 --> 1:02:11.811
(crying) No.

1:02:11.811 --> 1:02:13.980
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

1:02:14.897 --> 1:02:16.023
It's okay.

1:02:16.023 --> 1:02:17.567
Hey, hey.

1:02:17.567 --> 1:02:18.818
Hey, it's okay.

1:02:20.445 --> 1:02:21.279
It's okay.

1:02:22.613 --> 1:02:23.448
Allie.

1:02:25.783 --> 1:02:28.453
Allie, what are you looking at?

1:02:28.453 --> 1:02:31.289
(machine buzzing)

1:02:38.087 --> 1:02:38.921
- The ticket.

1:02:39.964 --> 1:02:41.966
(thunder rumbling)

1:02:41.966 --> 1:02:43.050
I don't know.

1:02:46.512 --> 1:02:47.513
I forgot to read it.

1:02:49.682 --> 1:02:51.267
- What does it say?

1:02:53.936 --> 1:02:55.062
- [Erik] At this point,

1:02:56.189 --> 1:02:57.356
it can't get any worse.

1:02:58.733 --> 1:03:00.109
- Allie, just tell us.

1:03:02.361 --> 1:03:04.781
- Remember what I tried telling you all

1:03:04.781 --> 1:03:06.908
that night at the observatory?

1:03:10.995 --> 1:03:13.372
- Why is a picture of them in here?

1:03:13.372 --> 1:03:14.207
What?

1:03:16.167 --> 1:03:18.795
We never understood a
single word you said!

1:03:23.674 --> 1:03:24.509
Oh my God.

1:03:27.595 --> 1:03:28.429
It's you.

1:03:29.931 --> 1:03:30.848
You're Wilmer.

1:03:32.642 --> 1:03:35.269
- Every beginning has an end.

1:03:35.269 --> 1:03:40.191
Life, lives, your lives, our lives.

1:03:42.401 --> 1:03:43.444
Dead or alive.

1:03:46.906 --> 1:03:49.033
- What do you mean your lives?

1:03:50.034 --> 1:03:51.369
- What Wilmer is trying to say

1:03:51.369 --> 1:03:53.996
is that we've been here with you before.

1:03:55.081 --> 1:03:56.749
- [Eden] What?

1:03:56.749 --> 1:03:57.917
- Tell 'em.

1:03:57.917 --> 1:03:59.502
Be more specific.

1:04:03.589 --> 1:04:07.093
- Wilmer, Norman from
the diner, and myself,

1:04:08.261 --> 1:04:09.095
we've been here.

1:04:10.513 --> 1:04:13.057
- [Vincent] The waitress, Donna.

1:04:14.100 --> 1:04:15.309
That smile,

1:04:16.227 --> 1:04:19.063
that very hospitality seen
in diners and truck stops

1:04:19.063 --> 1:04:20.147
across the country.

1:04:21.482 --> 1:04:23.901
The mayor knew she had loyalty

1:04:23.901 --> 1:04:26.821
and didn't have the courage to move on.

1:04:26.821 --> 1:04:29.073
Donna died in the '50s.

1:04:30.825 --> 1:04:33.160
- What the lady here, Miss Monroe,

1:04:33.160 --> 1:04:34.328
is trying to say,

1:04:34.328 --> 1:04:36.831
we pretty much stood like you

1:04:36.831 --> 1:04:40.585
and we stared into the
abyss of our own bodies.

1:04:42.086 --> 1:04:45.923
- [Vincent] The man at the
bar, the eccentric Norman,

1:04:46.841 --> 1:04:49.051
a child of the '70s,

1:04:49.051 --> 1:04:51.053
always saw things his way

1:04:51.053 --> 1:04:54.390
uniquely without consequence.

1:04:54.390 --> 1:04:56.267
Maybe that's why Marfa

1:04:56.267 --> 1:04:58.728
was all too comfortable for him.

1:04:58.728 --> 1:05:00.897
- Just like you all are now.

1:05:03.983 --> 1:05:04.942
- [Vincent] Wilmer.

1:05:06.360 --> 1:05:07.361
The man in the dark.

1:05:09.572 --> 1:05:10.907
The wise one of the bunch.

1:05:14.243 --> 1:05:15.912
His wisdom is what held him back.

1:05:17.288 --> 1:05:19.415
Always too afraid to try and move on.

1:05:20.541 --> 1:05:22.877
Although he's been
debating that with himself

1:05:24.003 --> 1:05:26.172
ever since his death back in the '60s.

1:05:28.549 --> 1:05:29.383
- When?

1:05:30.927 --> 1:05:31.969
When did this happen?

1:05:32.887 --> 1:05:34.430
- For us?

1:05:34.430 --> 1:05:36.390
A very long time ago.

1:05:36.390 --> 1:05:41.020
- [Norman] We all passed on
in our own time, individually.

1:05:41.020 --> 1:05:41.854
- No!

1:05:43.522 --> 1:05:45.524
I mean the car wreck.

1:05:45.524 --> 1:05:47.193
We need to get home.

1:05:48.819 --> 1:05:50.029
- Good luck to you, too.

1:05:51.614 --> 1:05:53.491
I hope that home is where you end up.

1:05:57.328 --> 1:05:58.746
- Not sure what that means.

1:05:59.664 --> 1:06:01.707
That's exactly where we're headed.

1:06:03.042 --> 1:06:05.628
(gentle music)

1:06:09.006 --> 1:06:11.842
(coin clattering)

1:06:34.991 --> 1:06:38.411
- [Vincent] Death stared him in the face.

1:06:41.497 --> 1:06:44.208
His own subconscious even grabbed him.

1:06:46.794 --> 1:06:48.254
- [Mysterious Voice] Erik.

1:06:48.254 --> 1:06:50.131
It's because of you.

1:06:50.131 --> 1:06:51.632
Go to the lights.

1:06:51.632 --> 1:06:55.678
- [Vincent] The gypsy never
stopped whispering in his ear.

1:06:55.678 --> 1:06:57.263
But he missed all the clues.

1:07:38.220 --> 1:07:39.847
- Hey Erik,

1:07:39.847 --> 1:07:41.682
you still good to drive, man?

1:07:41.682 --> 1:07:43.184
- Heck yeah, dude.

1:07:44.226 --> 1:07:45.227
- All right.

1:07:47.813 --> 1:07:48.981
Bye, dinosaur.

1:07:50.608 --> 1:07:52.943
- Erik has something he'd like to confess.

1:07:52.943 --> 1:07:54.904
- [Matthew] She's here too. Why not?

1:07:54.904 --> 1:07:55.988
Why not?

1:07:55.988 --> 1:07:58.949
- [Vincent] The gypsy, Heather.

1:07:58.949 --> 1:08:00.785
She died in the 1980s.

1:08:01.827 --> 1:08:04.288
Not much of a fortune teller,

1:08:04.288 --> 1:08:06.999
but then again, which of us is?

1:08:09.085 --> 1:08:10.753
- So what do you need to tell us?

1:08:12.004 --> 1:08:14.924
- Tell them what you did
back at the gas station.

1:08:14.924 --> 1:08:16.634
How you all got here.

1:08:16.634 --> 1:08:17.926
They have a right to know.

1:08:20.679 --> 1:08:22.139
- [Matthew] Erik, just say it.

1:08:28.312 --> 1:08:29.313
- I'd been drinking.

1:08:33.359 --> 1:08:35.611
I put alcohol in my
drink at the gas station.

1:08:37.446 --> 1:08:39.490
I wasn't in the right
frame of mind to drive.

1:08:39.490 --> 1:08:40.324
I'm sorry.

1:08:40.324 --> 1:08:42.827
(tense music)

1:08:45.788 --> 1:08:47.414
- You killed us!

1:08:47.414 --> 1:08:48.249
Huh?

1:08:49.959 --> 1:08:50.792
And I killed us too.

1:08:50.792 --> 1:08:51.627
- Why didn't you just let me drive?

1:08:51.627 --> 1:08:52.545
- No, stop!

1:08:53.546 --> 1:08:54.380
What's done is done.

1:08:54.380 --> 1:08:57.675
(Eden screams)

1:08:57.675 --> 1:09:00.261
(Eden sobbing)

1:09:02.888 --> 1:09:06.142
- [Erik] I'm sorry doesn't
even begin to cut it.

1:09:06.142 --> 1:09:09.478
- It's what you all do now that counts.

1:09:09.478 --> 1:09:10.771
Move on.

1:09:12.690 --> 1:09:14.191
- Trust in us!

1:09:14.191 --> 1:09:15.651
Testify!

1:09:15.651 --> 1:09:17.653
- [Donna] Do not let this keep you here.

1:09:21.115 --> 1:09:22.491
- Keep us from what? Huh?

1:09:23.951 --> 1:09:26.412
The car wreck concludes everything.

1:09:26.412 --> 1:09:29.290
- [Donna] No, you're not
listening, my darling.

1:09:29.290 --> 1:09:31.541
You need to move on just
like Wilmer told you.

1:09:31.541 --> 1:09:32.376
- We never had the courage

1:09:32.376 --> 1:09:33.919
which is why we are still here.

1:09:37.214 --> 1:09:38.048
- I've been a waitress

1:09:38.048 --> 1:09:39.550
a lot longer than you may think.

1:09:41.218 --> 1:09:44.180
- We're stuck here, here in this town.

1:09:47.683 --> 1:09:50.144
- [Matthew] You're stuck in Marfa.

1:09:51.437 --> 1:09:54.398
- [Norman] Yeah, in Marfa.

1:09:58.360 --> 1:10:00.821
- Well, yes and no.

1:10:00.821 --> 1:10:01.655
You see, Marfa is where the living

1:10:01.655 --> 1:10:03.365
and the dead cross roads.

1:10:04.325 --> 1:10:05.492
We don't interact with each other,

1:10:05.492 --> 1:10:07.827
but we share the same space together.

1:10:09.621 --> 1:10:10.456
- Yeah?

1:10:10.456 --> 1:10:12.333
That sounds like purgatory.

1:10:13.626 --> 1:10:15.002
- Right you are!

1:10:15.002 --> 1:10:17.963
This is what we've been
trying to share with you.

1:10:20.674 --> 1:10:22.425
- I wanted to.

1:10:22.425 --> 1:10:24.553
Miss Monroe told me not to.

1:10:25.429 --> 1:10:27.764
I've just been trying
to save you some moves,

1:10:27.764 --> 1:10:29.266
cut to the chase.

1:10:30.934 --> 1:10:32.978
- You didn't need to tell them.

1:10:32.978 --> 1:10:34.813
They need to figure it out on their own.

1:10:39.985 --> 1:10:42.362
- I just wanted them
to get out of this town

1:10:42.362 --> 1:10:46.075
and it could be so different for them.

1:10:50.329 --> 1:10:51.956
- You know as well as we all do,

1:10:52.957 --> 1:10:53.958
what's done is done.

1:10:55.709 --> 1:10:56.752
- Not necessarily.

1:10:58.254 --> 1:11:00.047
If they will listen to us right now,

1:11:01.215 --> 1:11:03.384
things could be different.

1:11:09.306 --> 1:11:10.474
- [Wilmer] Like I told you all

1:11:10.474 --> 1:11:13.559
that night at the observatory,

1:11:13.559 --> 1:11:16.272
those lights were a sign

1:11:16.272 --> 1:11:18.273
to protect those who would listen,

1:11:19.566 --> 1:11:24.280
that an ending is just
simply a new beginning.

1:11:24.280 --> 1:11:26.740
- What does that even mean, man? Come on.

1:11:26.740 --> 1:11:27.657
- A new beginning.

1:11:29.451 --> 1:11:30.369
A new beginning?

1:11:30.369 --> 1:11:31.620
We're dead!

1:11:31.620 --> 1:11:33.414
- To your new life.

1:11:33.414 --> 1:11:34.665
This is where you're at

1:11:34.665 --> 1:11:37.918
right here, right now.

1:11:37.918 --> 1:11:40.087
- Do not dwell on this.

1:11:40.087 --> 1:11:42.464
Do not put roots down in Marfa.

1:11:44.508 --> 1:11:45.675
Y'all need to move on.

1:11:46.969 --> 1:11:47.969
- What if...

1:11:50.723 --> 1:11:52.516
What if we never came to Marfa?

1:11:56.645 --> 1:12:01.650
Oh my god.

1:12:04.570 --> 1:12:07.489
- Look, I know you can't stay.

1:12:07.489 --> 1:12:09.491
I know you have to go

1:12:09.491 --> 1:12:10.951
and I know they have to go.

1:12:12.870 --> 1:12:14.788
- [Vincent] Henry, come with me.

1:12:16.415 --> 1:12:19.335
- I'm too afraid of my own judgment.

1:12:20.960 --> 1:12:23.047
- They have free will, so do you.

1:12:23.047 --> 1:12:25.174
They need to leave and
I'm leaving with them.

1:12:26.550 --> 1:12:27.425
- [Henry] I can't.

1:12:30.763 --> 1:12:31.638
- Why not, Henry?

1:12:33.766 --> 1:12:34.600
The mayor,

1:12:35.601 --> 1:12:38.478
the official gatekeeper of Marfa.

1:12:39.938 --> 1:12:41.857
I'm not really sure when he passed.

1:12:42.775 --> 1:12:43.942
He's always been here

1:12:44.860 --> 1:12:46.653
holding people down,

1:12:46.653 --> 1:12:49.073
keeping them from moving on.

1:12:50.866 --> 1:12:52.284
- [Henry] Walk to the light.

1:12:53.494 --> 1:12:56.371
(soft tense music)

1:13:27.361 --> 1:13:28.529
- For once in my life

1:13:30.406 --> 1:13:31.990
I actually saw this one coming.

1:13:35.452 --> 1:13:38.330
I hitchhiked my way across the country

1:13:38.330 --> 1:13:39.748
until I ended up right here.

1:13:40.874 --> 1:13:41.708
Marfa.

1:13:43.168 --> 1:13:45.087
Quiet, peaceful.

1:13:47.089 --> 1:13:50.550
I've been restless ever since
that day claimed my life.

1:13:52.969 --> 1:13:53.804
You're not the only one

1:13:53.804 --> 1:13:55.222
who bought a fortune telling ticket

1:13:55.222 --> 1:13:57.391
at that gas station, Allie.

1:13:59.768 --> 1:14:00.686
- You got one too?

1:14:02.771 --> 1:14:03.897
Did you read it?

1:14:03.897 --> 1:14:05.482
- Yes.

1:14:05.482 --> 1:14:06.316
I read mine.

1:14:08.068 --> 1:14:09.318
But you never read yours.

1:14:11.655 --> 1:14:13.073
Here's what I know.

1:14:13.073 --> 1:14:14.992
They always taught us

1:14:14.992 --> 1:14:16.410
never pick up hitchhikers,

1:14:17.995 --> 1:14:19.496
but they never told us about the dangers

1:14:19.496 --> 1:14:21.790
of getting in cars with strangers.

1:14:21.790 --> 1:14:22.624
- Wait, what?

1:14:23.834 --> 1:14:25.377
You knew this was gonna happen?

1:14:26.462 --> 1:14:30.466
You knew if you'd get in
the car with us, you'd die?

1:14:30.466 --> 1:14:31.967
- He hoped it wouldn't come to this.

1:14:31.967 --> 1:14:33.177
- [Vincent] That's right.

1:14:33.177 --> 1:14:36.054
- He hoped y'all would read the ticket.

1:14:36.054 --> 1:14:36.889
- Well since you've been here,
