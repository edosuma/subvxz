WEBVTT

00:01.000 --> 00:02.120
And you want to help me, don't you?

00:02.120 --> 00:03.960
For a start,
I'll take Felix Ferne's book.

00:03.960 --> 00:06.960
You gave him the Book
of Shadows? Why would you do that?

00:06.960 --> 00:08.080
Well, I didn't mean to!

00:08.080 --> 00:09.760
I know you know things.

00:09.760 --> 00:11.840
You are going to tell me
what happened.

00:11.840 --> 00:13.480
I've had it up to here
with all of you.

00:13.480 --> 00:15.960
Unless you tell me what I want to
know, there will be consequences.

00:15.960 --> 00:17.720
There are things I can do, you know?

00:17.720 --> 00:20.760
Things that can make your lives
a little less pleasant.

00:20.760 --> 00:25.040
Perhaps sending you back to Year 10.

00:25.040 --> 00:26.840
Why do you keep ditching me?
I thought we were friends.

00:26.840 --> 00:28.200
I thought we were
gonna do this together.

00:28.200 --> 00:29.400
We are.

00:29.400 --> 00:30.560
So what if someone's gay?

00:30.560 --> 00:33.400
What difference does that make
to anyone?

00:33.400 --> 00:36.560
I'm the one who gets to say
what I am, no-one else.

00:36.560 --> 00:39.080
Yeah, but at least I'm brave enough
to own who I am.

00:41.520 --> 00:45.120
Magic is tearing
the multiverse apart.

02:39.520 --> 02:42.280
Where is it?
Who's been in my office?

02:42.280 --> 02:45.000
Brianna! Who's been in my office?

02:46.000 --> 02:48.080
What does he want with Felix's book?
I don't...

02:48.080 --> 02:49.200
He could be
a cop.

02:49.200 --> 02:50.400
He didn't look like one.

02:50.400 --> 02:52.960
Maybe an undercover cop
pretending to be a teenager.

02:52.960 --> 02:55.040
This isn't 21 Jump Street.
He's not a cop.

02:55.040 --> 02:57.240
Fine. OK, what else
do we know about him?

02:57.240 --> 02:59.440
Well, he's got Bates
wrapped around his little finger.

02:59.440 --> 03:01.040
Heath's still ignoring me.

03:01.040 --> 03:02.600
Obviously!

03:02.600 --> 03:04.640
Do you really think
he'd just give up Felix's book?

03:04.640 --> 03:06.080
There's got to be more to it.

03:06.080 --> 03:07.560
We don't even know the guy's name.

03:10.400 --> 03:11.800
Oh, hi.

03:11.800 --> 03:13.400
Hi, Ms Jarra.
Hi.

03:13.400 --> 03:16.120
Luke, a word.

03:21.640 --> 03:22.960
What did you do?

03:22.960 --> 03:25.200
Can you be a little bit
more specific?

03:25.200 --> 03:27.880
I just had a staff meeting
with Mr Bates.

03:27.880 --> 03:30.680
He said you and your friends
stole a book from his office.

03:30.680 --> 03:34.440
Stealing a book?
Yeah, we're so hungry for knowledge.

03:34.440 --> 03:36.960
I don't know,
but Bryan was very upset.

03:36.960 --> 03:41.120
He's been upset quite a lot lately.
Is he OK?

03:42.120 --> 03:43.920
Maybe he should have a chat
with a counsellor.

03:43.920 --> 03:46.640
I mean, there's no shame
in asking for help.

03:46.640 --> 03:50.400
So, you didn't go into his office?
Take this book?

03:50.400 --> 03:53.080
No, I swear.

03:54.680 --> 03:57.440
Mr Bates wants to see you
first thing tomorrow.

03:57.440 --> 04:00.080
You can clear this up with him then.
Alright. Sure thing.

04:04.240 --> 04:06.680
Bates is accusing us
of grand theft notebook.

04:06.680 --> 04:08.040
Just what we need.

04:08.040 --> 04:10.000
You were outside Bates's office
longer than us.

04:10.000 --> 04:12.040
Did you hear anything, or...?

04:12.040 --> 04:13.560
Maybe his name, where he works,

04:13.560 --> 04:16.480
his favourite place to hang
on a Thursday afternoon.

04:16.480 --> 04:17.920
I didn't hear anything.

04:17.920 --> 04:20.279
Luke! Dinner in five!

04:20.279 --> 04:22.079
We need to talk to Heath.

04:22.079 --> 04:23.600
What do you think
I've been trying to do?

04:23.600 --> 04:26.280
Someone needs to go over
to his house.

04:26.280 --> 04:29.400
I'd offer, but I kinda like my head
still attached to my body.

04:32.560 --> 04:35.640
Fine. I'll go in the morning.

04:41.680 --> 04:44.680
Oh, Nicco.
Hi. Um, is Heath here?

04:44.680 --> 04:46.200
He's staying home today.

04:46.200 --> 04:47.640
Oh, is he sick?

04:47.640 --> 04:49.960
He said he felt a bit off-colour,
but I don't know.

04:49.960 --> 04:52.480
It seemed like something more.

04:52.480 --> 04:55.000
He didn't eat his dinner last night.
Not hungry.

04:55.000 --> 04:56.960
Yeah, that doesn't sound like Heath.

04:56.960 --> 04:59.800
Mysteries of teenage boys.

04:59.800 --> 05:01.720
Just head in if you like.

05:09.640 --> 05:11.320
Heath!

05:14.240 --> 05:16.600
Heath?

05:25.080 --> 05:26.320
Eww...

05:26.320 --> 05:28.520
Oh, gross.

05:29.560 --> 05:31.480
Lucky I've had my tetanus booster.

05:32.760 --> 05:34.680
Eww!

05:34.680 --> 05:36.440
Wakey-wakey!

05:36.440 --> 05:38.600
Good morning!

05:38.600 --> 05:40.400
You wagging school?

05:40.400 --> 05:42.480
Not wagging, I'm quitting.

05:42.480 --> 05:44.360
You can't quit school. That's stupid.

05:44.360 --> 05:45.960
Actually, I can.

05:45.960 --> 05:49.200
Quitting and stupidity
are my superpowers.

05:49.200 --> 05:51.760
Well, then, what are you going to do?

05:51.760 --> 05:54.320
I don't know - get a job, pay taxes,

05:54.320 --> 05:56.800
watch murder mysteries,
complain about young people.

05:56.800 --> 05:59.600
Whatever adults do.
That sounds terrible.

06:02.080 --> 06:04.520
He's gonna make me
go back to Year 10.

06:04.520 --> 06:06.720
Bates?

06:11.520 --> 06:14.120
I'm so sick of it, Nicco.

06:14.120 --> 06:17.640
I feel like everyone else
knows the rules of the game

06:17.640 --> 06:20.640
and I'm still stuck on square one.

06:20.640 --> 06:23.400
Probably because
I can't read the instructions.

06:25.760 --> 06:28.960
Is everyone still mad
about the book?

06:30.120 --> 06:31.240
Hmm...

06:31.240 --> 06:33.160
I didn't want to give it to him.

06:33.160 --> 06:35.360
But then, suddenly, I just...

06:35.360 --> 06:36.840
..well, I did.

06:36.840 --> 06:38.800
What do you mean?

06:38.800 --> 06:41.480
It's like I wasn't in control.
I just handed it over.

06:41.480 --> 06:44.440
He used magic!
Why didn't you say anything?

06:44.440 --> 06:45.720
When?

06:45.720 --> 06:50.080
Before, during or after
all my friends were yelling at me?

06:50.080 --> 06:51.640
Yeah, sorry about that.

06:53.400 --> 06:54.800
Really.

06:57.560 --> 07:01.000
We need you back.
We need your smarts to find this guy.

07:02.040 --> 07:04.240
Things must really be desperate.

07:04.240 --> 07:06.480
We can't do it without you.

07:06.480 --> 07:09.520
Do you remember anything
that could help?

07:15.840 --> 07:18.080
Zeb? What kind of name
is that?

07:18.080 --> 07:20.720
Short for Zebediah or Zebedee.

07:20.720 --> 07:23.000
Says here Zebedee was a fisherman
who left his boat...

07:23.000 --> 07:24.800
Can we save the fun facts
for another time?

07:24.800 --> 07:25.800
OK.

07:25.800 --> 07:28.680
Um, so Zeb. There can't be
too many of them around, right?

07:28.680 --> 07:32.120
Well, actually there's Zeb the Pug,
who has two million followers.

07:32.120 --> 07:34.080
There's a zero calorie ice-cream
called Zebalicious...

07:34.080 --> 07:37.480
Listen, Heath thinks that Zeb
put a spell on him -

07:37.480 --> 07:39.800
forced him to hand over the book.

07:39.800 --> 07:42.040
Zeb knows magic?
Oh, that's convenient.

07:42.040 --> 07:44.560
What's that supposed to mean?
Well, it gets Heath off the hook.

07:44.560 --> 07:46.440
Magic ate my homework.

07:46.440 --> 07:48.000
Maybe because he deserves
to be off the hook.

07:48.000 --> 07:49.400
OK, it doesn't matter
what Heath did.

07:49.400 --> 07:51.360
If we find Zeb, we find the book.

07:51.360 --> 07:52.840
Zeb emailed Bates.

07:52.840 --> 07:54.840
The following students

07:54.840 --> 07:56.480
report to the principal's office.

07:56.480 --> 07:58.280
Niccolina Pandelis, Luke Hamil...
Come on, let's go.

07:58.280 --> 08:01.040
..Ben Ripley, Heath Buckland
and Jesse Banda.

08:01.040 --> 08:02.360
We need a plan.

08:02.360 --> 08:03.880
If Zeb contacted Bates by email,

08:03.880 --> 08:05.680
that means his address
is still on the school server.

08:05.680 --> 08:07.240
Great. How do we access that?

08:08.280 --> 08:09.880
There you are.

08:09.880 --> 08:13.080
So, where's Buckland?
He's sick, sir.

08:13.080 --> 08:15.480
Well, frankly, I know how he feels

08:15.480 --> 08:18.360
because I am sickened by
the utter contempt

08:18.360 --> 08:20.320
that you five have shown
for authority.

08:20.320 --> 08:23.040
I'm sorry,
I'm just...not following you.

08:23.040 --> 08:24.120
Don't give me that!

08:24.120 --> 08:26.360
You were in my office,
the book was in my office,

08:26.360 --> 08:30.240
and then you weren't in my office
and the book wasn't in my office!

08:30.240 --> 08:31.720
That's circumstantial, sir.
Yes!

08:31.720 --> 08:34.559
The circumstance being that you
stole the book from my office!

08:34.559 --> 08:35.679
No, we didn't.

08:35.679 --> 08:37.960
You are facing suspension...

08:37.960 --> 08:39.559
..even expulsion.

08:39.559 --> 08:41.600
Expulsion?
Well, that's a bit extreme.

08:41.600 --> 08:43.039
What about the Zeb guy?
Mr Cool.

08:43.039 --> 08:44.480
How do you know
he didn't take the book?

08:44.480 --> 08:47.080
Yeah, he was around all afternoon.
Who was he anyway?

08:47.080 --> 08:49.480
I am willing to give you
one last chance,

08:49.480 --> 08:53.640
if - and ONLY if -
the item in question

08:53.640 --> 08:56.120
is back on my desk
by the end of the day.

08:56.120 --> 08:58.280
Get to class. Now!

08:58.280 --> 09:02.040
All we have to do is gain access
to Bremin High's mainframe.

09:02.040 --> 09:04.000
Yeah, 'cause that's super easy.
It's doable.

09:04.000 --> 09:06.600
But tricky. It could take
a while to figure it all out.

09:06.600 --> 09:08.800
Can't you get access to
the staff emails through your Mum?

09:08.800 --> 09:10.280
Oh, yeah.

09:10.280 --> 09:12.800
Hey, Mum, can I just have
your email password?

09:12.800 --> 09:14.760
Have you ever met my mother?

09:14.760 --> 09:18.000
Let's get to class.
We'll sort it out at lunch.

09:18.000 --> 09:22.640
So, you know how I'm an all-singing,
all-dancing triple threat?

09:22.640 --> 09:25.840
Well...well, with that level of drama

09:25.840 --> 09:29.000
comes a sprinkling of...

09:29.000 --> 09:32.080
There's a chance I overreacted.

09:32.080 --> 09:33.400
A chance?

09:33.400 --> 09:35.800
OK, I overreacted.

09:35.800 --> 09:37.520
It's just...
I know you've got a lot going on,

09:37.520 --> 09:41.520
but you're so good at
dealing with it all, unlike me.

09:41.520 --> 09:43.240
Let me get this straight.

09:43.240 --> 09:46.400
You're saying it's my fault
you overreacted

09:46.400 --> 09:48.160
because I'm emotionally stable?

09:48.160 --> 09:53.120
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

09:56.520 --> 09:58.680
You know, for someone
so bright and shiny,

09:58.680 --> 10:00.840
I can sometimes be a little dim.

10:02.840 --> 10:04.440
You really can.

10:15.760 --> 10:17.560
Hey.

10:17.560 --> 10:20.160
Forgot my chemistry book.

10:22.120 --> 10:23.280
So mature.

10:25.040 --> 10:27.760
You know what, Nicco?
Peta. Nicco. I need a word.

10:35.120 --> 10:36.320
You two OK?

10:36.320 --> 10:38.200
Yeah, fine.

10:38.200 --> 10:40.480
Fine.
OK.

10:40.480 --> 10:43.160
Here's the deal.
I've got one spot for try-outs.

10:43.160 --> 10:44.680
You have to compete for it.

10:46.800 --> 10:49.080
Not a problem.
Yeah, no problem.

10:56.120 --> 10:58.240
A dull roar, please!

10:58.240 --> 11:01.960
As you can see, I'm not
Ms O'Donnell. She is unwell...again.

11:01.960 --> 11:04.760
People, come on!

11:04.760 --> 11:07.320
You're in Year 11 now. You should
be capable of self-starting.

11:07.320 --> 11:09.400
Get on with it! Hand those out!

11:16.520 --> 11:19.240
Shouldn't you be in class?
Probably.

11:23.040 --> 11:24.800
Well?

11:24.800 --> 11:30.400
Uh...you know that guy, Zeb, who was
here yesterday, with the topknot?

11:30.400 --> 11:32.200
I may have noticed him.

11:32.200 --> 11:33.840
Actually, I'd better get to class...

11:33.840 --> 11:35.200
No, no, wait! Wait.

11:35.200 --> 11:37.480
Did he...? Just...
What were you gonna say?

11:38.760 --> 11:42.520
Um, well, I think his bike's
parked out front.

11:42.520 --> 11:44.200
He's back?

11:44.200 --> 11:46.360
I don't know, I just saw his bike.

11:46.360 --> 11:48.840
I'd better make sure
he signs in as a visitor.

11:48.840 --> 11:50.840
I should do that.

11:52.640 --> 11:55.000
You should get to class.

12:15.800 --> 12:18.280
I can't believe I'm doing this.

12:24.320 --> 12:26.960
Sorry, Coach Jane wanted to see me.

12:32.320 --> 12:34.880
Zeb better have the book
or we're expelled.

12:47.760 --> 12:49.280
About time.

12:49.280 --> 12:53.240
Mum would kill me
if she knew we emailed a stranger.

12:53.240 --> 12:54.480
He replied.

12:54.480 --> 12:56.040
"I've been waiting
to hear from you."

12:56.040 --> 12:57.480
That's kind of creepy.

12:57.480 --> 13:00.280
Or sweet, depending on the context.

13:00.280 --> 13:02.160
OK, maybe not in this context.

13:02.160 --> 13:05.120
Ooh, but maybe in this one.

13:09.920 --> 13:14.840
# But you're so very young

13:16.240 --> 13:19.600
♪ You live in an empire... ♪

13:19.600 --> 13:22.800
# At the mercy of men

13:27.080 --> 13:31.360
♪ And do it again
and again and again... ♪

13:34.280 --> 13:36.880
Hey, Jesse?

13:42.920 --> 13:45.120
I can't believe Ali did this.

13:45.120 --> 13:48.240
He's got the book
and he wants to meet up.

13:48.240 --> 13:49.920
Good. When and where?

13:49.920 --> 13:52.160
He knows magic, remember?
This could be a trap.

13:52.160 --> 13:55.480
Then we meet him somewhere public.
Like Little Gino's.

13:57.400 --> 13:59.680
I'll go. I'll meet up with him.

13:59.680 --> 14:01.520
We should all go. This is dangerous.

14:01.520 --> 14:04.640
Well, then, we need Heath,
in case we need to do a spell.

14:04.640 --> 14:06.840
Start practising your apologies.

14:13.400 --> 14:14.680
Hey.

14:14.680 --> 14:16.360
Heath...

14:16.360 --> 14:18.000
We need you.

14:18.000 --> 14:19.400
Luke's meeting Zeb and...

14:19.400 --> 14:21.440
That sounds like a terrible idea.
That guy's trouble.

14:21.440 --> 14:23.160
It's the only way
to get Felix's book back.

14:26.640 --> 14:27.760
Meeting him where?

14:27.760 --> 14:30.080
Little Gino's, after school.
You need to come.

14:30.080 --> 14:33.480
Yeah, and what do the others think?
Do they want me there?

14:33.480 --> 14:35.080
Let me check.

14:35.080 --> 14:36.960
Guys, do you want Heath there?

14:36.960 --> 14:39.160
Yes, we do. Yes, I suppose.
Mm, sure.

14:40.600 --> 14:41.760
Hear that?

14:41.760 --> 14:44.920
Hear what?
Just sounds like mumbling.

14:44.920 --> 14:46.400
Louder.

14:46.400 --> 14:48.280
Sorry, Heath.

14:48.280 --> 14:50.880
I'll think about it.

14:54.200 --> 14:55.640
Well?

14:57.320 --> 14:58.600
I don't know.

15:04.360 --> 15:07.080
Yeah, yeah. Coming.

15:09.640 --> 15:13.080
Why are you knocking?
I showed you where the spare key is.

15:13.080 --> 15:14.760
Sorry, it's just ...

15:14.760 --> 15:17.280
I know you're really, really sick
but we need your help.

15:21.080 --> 15:23.560
What's happened?

15:37.600 --> 15:40.040
Nicco's on her way with Ellen.

15:48.720 --> 15:50.600
It's show time.

16:03.160 --> 16:05.320
Hi.
Can I sit here?

16:05.320 --> 16:06.760
You sure, Luke?

16:06.760 --> 16:08.560
I wouldn't want to block
your friends' view.

16:08.560 --> 16:11.920
Huh?
Let's keep this simple.

16:13.520 --> 16:16.960
So, how have you been?

16:18.440 --> 16:20.280
I'm kidding. I don't care.

16:20.280 --> 16:21.520
Did you bring the book?

16:21.520 --> 16:23.280
Never leave home without it.

16:23.280 --> 16:25.240
It's too valuable to lose.

16:29.960 --> 16:31.600
I'll watch the back exit.

16:39.720 --> 16:41.520
Ugh!

16:41.520 --> 16:43.760
It's like single-origin drain water.

16:43.760 --> 16:46.120
Sure you don't want something?

16:46.120 --> 16:48.480
The book. I want it back.
We need it.

16:48.480 --> 16:49.920
You're very intense.

16:49.920 --> 16:52.080
I thought you were the laid-back one

16:52.080 --> 16:54.040
who liked video games
and comic books.

16:54.040 --> 16:55.280
How do you know that?

16:56.800 --> 16:58.080
What are they doing?

16:58.080 --> 17:00.280
Luke's trying to get
the book back, I hope.

17:00.280 --> 17:02.800
But you didn't mention
one of your interests.

17:04.160 --> 17:06.319
Magic.

17:06.319 --> 17:08.839
If you don't have the book,
then I'm out.

17:08.839 --> 17:10.280
No, you're not.

17:10.280 --> 17:13.480
Elements that knit and bind,
Hear my will, join different kind

17:15.760 --> 17:18.400
Something's wrong.
How can you tell?

17:22.079 --> 17:24.560
You're gonna do
exactly what I tell you.

17:24.560 --> 17:26.079
Attaboy.

17:26.079 --> 17:28.319
I think we should get out of here.

17:29.560 --> 17:31.040
What do you reckon?

17:31.040 --> 17:33.640
It would be better if you said it.

17:33.640 --> 17:36.160
Yeah, let's get out of here.

17:36.160 --> 17:37.720
Great idea.

17:37.720 --> 17:39.880
Waiting for a free meal?

17:39.880 --> 17:42.720
Meat lovers and pineapple?
And barbecue sauce.

17:42.720 --> 17:44.280
Glad you're back.
What are you doing here?

17:44.280 --> 17:46.440
Heavy lifting. Fire power.

17:46.440 --> 17:49.320
Smouldering good looks.
Whatever you need.

17:49.320 --> 17:52.760
Don't worry,
I've got the good looks covered.

17:52.760 --> 17:54.120
So, what'd I miss?

17:56.440 --> 17:58.080
Where are they?

17:58.080 --> 18:02.400
What? They were just here.
They were just here!

18:02.400 --> 18:04.200
Don't panic.

18:04.200 --> 18:05.880
Maybe Ellen saw something?

18:10.400 --> 18:11.440
Ellen?!

18:11.440 --> 18:13.720
Ellen, did you see them?

18:13.720 --> 18:15.280
Which way did they go?

18:15.280 --> 18:18.560
Luke just drove past.
He seemed fine.

18:19.960 --> 18:21.840
You don't look so good.
Maybe I should drive.

18:26.440 --> 18:28.920
Some time today!
Why would Luke go off with Zeb?

18:28.920 --> 18:30.760
Maybe he used the same spell
he used on Heath.

18:30.760 --> 18:32.600
So, now you believe me.

18:32.600 --> 18:34.600
Zeb could be responsible for
the nematodes.

18:34.600 --> 18:35.800
He could use them to attack us.

18:35.800 --> 18:37.960
Hey, listen.

18:37.960 --> 18:40.600
Which way's it coming from?

18:40.600 --> 18:42.080
That way.

18:44.280 --> 18:46.480
- Get in, get in!
- Getting in!

18:52.880 --> 18:54.360
Quick, quick,
they're getting away.

18:54.360 --> 18:56.080
Left, left, left, left,
turn left!

18:56.080 --> 18:58.520
Nobody likes
a backseat driver, Jesse.

19:05.040 --> 19:06.880
You're sure
they went this way?

19:11.200 --> 19:12.920
We lost them.
Can't have!

19:12.920 --> 19:15.120
It's like they just disappeared.

19:15.120 --> 19:17.640
There, follow them! Quick!

19:25.880 --> 19:27.360
Sit.

19:28.720 --> 19:30.520
My friends'll come for me.

19:30.520 --> 19:31.880
I'm counting on it.

19:31.880 --> 19:33.560
You saw how many laps
around the block I had to do

19:33.560 --> 19:34.960
before they followed me.

19:34.960 --> 19:37.800
- There's the bike.
- They're here.

19:39.240 --> 19:43.040
Hey, you OK?
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

19:43.040 --> 19:44.400
You should stay here.

19:44.400 --> 19:46.120
I'm fine, really.

19:46.120 --> 19:48.440
You never know - we might
need to make a quick getaway.

19:48.440 --> 19:50.440
Be careful.
Let's go!

19:54.480 --> 19:56.840
That'll be them now.

19:56.840 --> 19:59.880
Brave but predictable.

20:07.360 --> 20:09.280
Allow me.

20:19.720 --> 20:21.640
I loosened it for you.

20:21.640 --> 20:23.240
I did too.

20:25.000 --> 20:26.880
So, there's your firepower.

20:26.880 --> 20:29.280
This is almost too easy.

20:29.280 --> 20:31.120
You know about elementals?

20:32.240 --> 20:34.240
That's why you stole our book.

20:38.680 --> 20:42.680
- Whoa.
- This place is huge.

20:42.680 --> 20:44.320
I like what he's done with it.

20:44.320 --> 20:46.000
He's gone for the industrial look.

20:46.000 --> 20:47.960
Can we get on with it?

20:47.960 --> 20:51.600
OK, I say we make a sweep,
cover the area methodically.

20:51.600 --> 20:53.440
A man with a plan.

20:53.440 --> 20:56.880
Mm. Man with a plan.

20:59.280 --> 21:01.360
Why are you doing this?

21:01.360 --> 21:04.680
We're not your enemy.
I know.

21:04.680 --> 21:06.640
I'd say we're gonna be pals
in the long run.

21:06.640 --> 21:08.520
It's a funny way to treat your pals.

21:08.520 --> 21:11.760
There'll be plenty of time
to talk about this, but not now.

21:11.760 --> 21:13.000
Yeah, but...
Shh!

21:13.000 --> 21:14.280
Mmm...

21:14.280 --> 21:16.680
Don't want to miss the good bit.
Mmmmm!

21:20.000 --> 21:22.320
I'm ready for my close-up.

21:28.560 --> 21:30.520
There's something in the way.

21:30.520 --> 21:31.960
You're the door ninja.

21:31.960 --> 21:33.640
After you.

21:42.640 --> 21:45.480
Sandbags. Heaps of them.

21:45.480 --> 21:46.800
Can you move them?

21:46.800 --> 21:48.920
What do you think?

22:05.840 --> 22:09.240
So, Nicco is your earth element,

22:09.240 --> 22:12.040
which just leaves water and air.

22:12.040 --> 22:15.680
Aside from me, of course. Don't mean
to brag, but air is the best.

22:20.560 --> 22:24.160
Come in! Don't be shy.

22:24.160 --> 22:26.880
We've been waiting for you.

22:31.000 --> 22:32.680
Should have bought pastries.

22:32.680 --> 22:34.800
Luke, are you OK?

22:34.800 --> 22:37.280
He's not in a very chatty mood.

22:37.280 --> 22:38.920
Elements that knit and bind,

22:38.920 --> 22:40.840
Hear my will, join different kinds...

22:40.840 --> 22:42.200
It's a binding spell!

22:42.200 --> 22:44.080
Let's just get you lined up.

22:51.000 --> 22:53.240
That's better. Now we can talk.

22:53.240 --> 22:56.760
Well, I'll talk, you listen.

22:56.760 --> 22:58.840
Here's what's going to happen.

22:58.840 --> 23:01.520
I need your help in negative space,

23:01.520 --> 23:03.960
so we're all going
on a little journey.

23:05.280 --> 23:07.120
Elements obey me.

23:07.120 --> 23:08.640
Heed my call.

23:08.640 --> 23:10.600
Become the power,

23:10.600 --> 23:11.880
Source of all.

23:11.880 --> 23:13.360
Elements guide me,

23:13.360 --> 23:15.200
See the unseen.

23:15.200 --> 23:17.200
Open the space between.

23:21.760 --> 23:25.000
It's time, Ellen.

23:25.000 --> 23:26.920
What's going on?

23:26.920 --> 23:28.640
You know what you have to do.

23:28.640 --> 23:30.760
No, I don't.

23:30.760 --> 23:33.560
Get out of my head!

23:33.560 --> 23:35.880
Let's not fight.

23:35.880 --> 23:38.240
It will be easier on you.

23:38.240 --> 23:40.880
You know what I'm saying is true.

23:43.880 --> 23:45.840
What do you want me to do?

23:47.000 --> 23:49.280
Find the elementals.

23:49.280 --> 23:51.640
It's the air power we need.

23:51.640 --> 23:55.800
He's the most powerful.
He must be the one.

23:55.800 --> 23:57.120
Get him.

23:57.120 --> 24:00.520
No. I'm not doing it.

24:00.520 --> 24:01.880
I don't want to hurt anyone...

24:01.880 --> 24:03.720
Enough!

24:06.480 --> 24:09.160
That's better. Let's go.

24:12.240 --> 24:13.520
Ellen...

24:16.360 --> 24:18.880
Don't scare the children.

24:24.840 --> 24:28.200
Just going on a little trip
to negative space.

24:28.200 --> 24:29.720
Interesting.

24:36.600 --> 24:37.600
What was that?

24:37.600 --> 24:40.840
We need to find out exactly what
just happened. Who is Zeb, really?

24:40.840 --> 24:43.040
Well, he's an elemental,
just like us.

24:43.040 --> 24:45.160
If we could just figure out
where he's from.

24:45.160 --> 24:46.960
Then we can figure out
what he wants.

24:48.560 --> 24:50.120
Ellen was acting a little weird.

24:50.120 --> 24:52.160
Weird? How?

24:52.160 --> 24:53.960
Well, she saves us by using a spell,

24:53.960 --> 24:56.400
speaking in a strange language
that no-one's ever heard of before.

24:56.400 --> 24:57.960
Good morning. How are you?

24:57.960 --> 25:00.240
Where's Luke?
How would I know?

25:01.560 --> 25:03.680
Are you lying?
Why would I lie?

25:06.360 --> 25:07.800
Is everything alright?

25:07.800 --> 25:10.080
Everything's fine.
