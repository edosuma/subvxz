WEBVTT

00:32.075 --> 00:35.165
Don't be afraid, Margot.
Do what Miep says.

00:35.165 --> 00:36.949
Yes.

00:36.949 --> 00:38.125
I wanna go too.

00:38.125 --> 00:39.561
No.
You'll go later with us.

00:39.561 --> 00:41.128
Why can't I go now?

00:41.128 --> 00:43.086
Because we decided, Anne,
you would go with us later.

00:43.086 --> 00:45.219
You never
consult me on anything!

00:45.219 --> 00:46.437
Margot, do you know
where we're going?

00:46.437 --> 00:47.960
Anne, please, not now.

00:47.960 --> 00:49.049
We, we really have to go.

00:49.049 --> 00:50.180
I don't
know either, Anne.

00:50.180 --> 00:51.355
Well, goodbye then.

00:51.355 --> 00:52.661
No, no, no,
we're not saying goodbye

00:52.661 --> 00:54.141
because we'll see you soon.

00:54.141 --> 00:55.229
How soon?

00:55.229 --> 00:57.144
Don't worry.
In a few hours.

00:57.144 --> 00:58.667
So the hiding
place is in town?

00:58.667 --> 00:59.929
Well, you really
are a pain in the ass.

00:59.929 --> 01:01.365
So are you.

01:01.365 --> 01:02.236
Can you go and get
your sister's coat please?

01:02.236 --> 01:04.064
Listen to me, darling.

01:04.064 --> 01:07.023
It's just an
ordinary bike ride, okay?

01:07.023 --> 01:08.372
Yeah.

01:08.372 --> 01:09.895
Huh?
Uh-hmm.

01:09.895 --> 01:11.549
That's better.

01:11.549 --> 01:12.811
And remember.

01:12.811 --> 01:14.726
I know.
Do what Miep says.

01:14.726 --> 01:15.945
Do what Miep says.

01:15.945 --> 01:18.034
Good girl.

01:18.034 --> 01:19.253
You listen to Miep.

01:19.253 --> 01:21.255
Okay.
Let's, let's go.

01:21.255 --> 01:23.083
Put your coat on. But...

01:23.083 --> 01:24.127
In case the
neighbors are watching.

01:24.127 --> 01:25.172
Go on.

01:25.172 --> 01:28.218
Don't look nervous.

01:29.741 --> 01:31.439
There you go.

01:31.439 --> 01:32.962
Hurry.

01:32.962 --> 01:34.877
We need to get there before
they open the checkpoint.

01:42.711 --> 01:44.669
Let's go.

02:16.919 --> 02:20.140
Hurry. Faster.

02:27.538 --> 02:29.105
Uh, what should I.

02:29.105 --> 02:31.107
Drop it.
On the ground?

02:31.107 --> 02:34.241
Drop it. Yes.
Let's go. Margot.

02:54.174 --> 02:55.349
Attention. Attention.

02:55.349 --> 02:58.352
Have your papers ready.

02:59.004 --> 03:00.658
Oh, my God.
We're too late.

03:00.658 --> 03:02.225
The checkpoint is open.

03:02.225 --> 03:03.661
Attention. Attention.

03:03.661 --> 03:05.228
Please have your
identification ready.

03:05.228 --> 03:06.925
I, I don't have my ID.
I know.

03:06.925 --> 03:08.318
Because you told
me not to bring it and

03:08.318 --> 03:09.667
you told me to take off my coat.

03:09.667 --> 03:11.278
Margot.

03:11.278 --> 03:12.148
And if they see I'm
not wearing my star, they're,

03:12.148 --> 03:13.410
they're going to arrest me.

03:13.410 --> 03:16.239
Margot, stop it
and listen to me, okay?

03:16.239 --> 03:17.414
No, no, no, no, no.

03:17.414 --> 03:22.811
Don't cry. Don't cry.
Don't cry. Okay?

03:29.426 --> 03:31.950
Come on.
Quickly. That way.

03:32.429 --> 03:35.127
You apologize and
say you forgot your ID.

03:35.824 --> 03:37.608
What if they stop me?

03:37.608 --> 03:39.306
They won't,
if you smile.

03:39.306 --> 03:41.743
You can't show any fear.

03:43.005 --> 03:44.876
He's looking at us. Laugh.

03:44.876 --> 03:47.444
I can't tell if you're joking.

03:47.444 --> 03:50.752
Yeah. Okay.
What was that?

03:50.752 --> 03:53.624
What was that?

03:53.624 --> 03:54.886
I can't do this.

03:54.886 --> 03:56.410
Margot, I forgot
my ID two days ago.

03:56.410 --> 03:57.454
They let me right through.

03:57.454 --> 03:58.586
No.
I'm going back.

03:58.586 --> 04:00.805
No.
He's already seen us.

04:00.805 --> 04:04.505
All right.
Listen to me.

04:05.941 --> 04:09.510
I really don't
think I can do this.

04:09.510 --> 04:12.339
Margot, you can do this.

04:12.817 --> 04:15.994
You are so much stronger
than you think you are.

04:18.170 --> 04:20.521
Go on.
Let me see.

04:32.881 --> 04:36.493
Miep!

04:37.320 --> 04:38.887
Miep!

04:38.887 --> 04:40.584
Get up!

04:44.196 --> 04:46.242
It is lunch time!

04:46.242 --> 04:49.289
You're just
sleeping the day away!

04:55.643 --> 04:57.732
What are you doing?

04:57.993 --> 04:59.124
Look
who's finally up.

04:59.124 --> 05:00.517
Oh, here we go.

05:00.517 --> 05:01.866
Don't
"here we go" me.

05:01.866 --> 05:03.346
It is 2:00 PM.

05:03.346 --> 05:05.653
You were out
drinking again last night.

05:05.653 --> 05:08.264
You promised me you were
gonna spend all week
looking for a job.

05:09.483 --> 05:11.398
He's the one you
should be worried about,

05:11.398 --> 05:13.661
burping and farting his
way through the world.

05:14.705 --> 05:18.492
Oh, my God!
Jacob, that stinks!

05:19.536 --> 05:20.972
Mom, don't look so worried.

05:20.972 --> 05:22.757
It's fine.
I'm gonna get a job.

05:22.757 --> 05:24.541
When?
What steps have you taken?

05:24.541 --> 05:26.151
The economy's bad.
You know that.

05:26.151 --> 05:27.544
Jobs are hard to come by.

05:27.544 --> 05:29.024
You're not going
to find one in a pub,

05:29.024 --> 05:31.809
so perhaps you should try
and find a husband instead.

05:32.680 --> 05:34.203
Oh, you're enjoying this,
aren't you?

05:34.203 --> 05:37.032
I am.
I really am.

05:37.032 --> 05:38.773
Tell her.

05:38.773 --> 05:40.209
Tell me what?

05:40.209 --> 05:41.341
Why me?

05:41.341 --> 05:42.429
Because
you're her father.

05:42.429 --> 05:43.647
And
you're her mother.

05:43.647 --> 05:45.823
Well, can one
of you just tell me?

05:46.258 --> 05:49.261
Your father
and I have been talking.

05:49.523 --> 05:53.265
We think you should
get married to Cas.

05:59.707 --> 06:02.579
You looked so serious.

06:02.579 --> 06:05.060
Did you see their faces?

06:06.757 --> 06:07.758
Wait.

06:07.758 --> 06:09.064
Is this actually happening?

06:09.064 --> 06:10.979
Cas has
got a good job.

06:10.979 --> 06:13.242
He's stable and he's nice.

06:13.242 --> 06:14.417
And he's my brother.

06:14.417 --> 06:16.114
You're adopted
so it's not illegal.

06:16.114 --> 06:17.246
Your father checked.

06:17.246 --> 06:18.813
Checked? Whoa.
Whoa. With who?

06:18.813 --> 06:19.944
And Cas is single.

06:19.944 --> 06:21.163
And he's not
getting any younger.

06:21.163 --> 06:23.252
So it would solve
everybody's problems.

06:23.252 --> 06:24.732
No one has a problem.

06:24.732 --> 06:26.081
Cas, say something.

06:26.081 --> 06:29.214
Uh, I.

06:29.824 --> 06:31.042
He doesn't
wanna marry me.

06:31.042 --> 06:32.783
We can't keep
supporting you forever.

06:32.783 --> 06:36.439
You, you've got to grow up,
get your life together.

06:36.439 --> 06:38.659
What, by
marrying my brother?

06:38.659 --> 06:41.966
Unless
you've got a better idea.

06:43.359 --> 06:45.535
Oh, my.

06:53.021 --> 06:55.676
So gonna fling
yourself in the canal then?

06:55.676 --> 06:57.547
End it all right here?

06:57.547 --> 06:59.897
Put us all out of our misery?

06:59.897 --> 07:01.986
Sorry I don't
want to marry you, Cas.

07:01.986 --> 07:03.335
It's all right.

07:03.335 --> 07:05.642
You're not my type anyway.

07:05.642 --> 07:06.948
You ever
gonna tell them?

07:06.948 --> 07:08.210
Oh, yeah.

07:08.210 --> 07:10.821
"Hey, Mom, I like boys.
Pass the roast beef."

07:10.821 --> 07:12.083
She'd die.

07:12.083 --> 07:13.258
On the spot.

07:13.258 --> 07:15.478
Just face down into
the mashed potato.

07:15.478 --> 07:17.393
And then I would be a
homosexual and responsible for

07:17.393 --> 07:18.873
our mother's death.

07:18.873 --> 07:20.396
That's not good.

07:20.396 --> 07:22.485
You know, the worst
thing about it is that's all

07:22.485 --> 07:25.488
they think I'm capable of,
marrying my brother.

07:25.488 --> 07:28.448
No.
They're just panicking.

07:31.276 --> 07:32.539
All right then.

07:32.539 --> 07:35.063
Let's get you a job.

07:35.933 --> 07:39.154
What are you doing?
I'm writing you a CV.

07:39.154 --> 07:40.372
Okay.

07:40.372 --> 07:45.813
"I am a young woman
from a very good family.

07:46.378 --> 07:50.078
I have no previous job
experience, so no references,

07:50.078 --> 07:54.517
unfortunately, but my
school grades were..."

07:54.517 --> 07:55.910
Terrible.

07:55.910 --> 08:00.654
"Adequate.
My technical skills are..."

08:00.654 --> 08:02.830
Nonexistent.

08:02.830 --> 08:04.745
They're "Emerging."

08:04.745 --> 08:05.833
Oh, my God.

08:05.833 --> 08:07.487
I am pathetic!

08:07.487 --> 08:09.010
No.

08:09.010 --> 08:10.838
We just need to sell some
of your positive qualities.

08:10.838 --> 08:13.318
To who?
Jobs really are hard to come by.

08:13.318 --> 08:15.886
Yeah.

08:15.886 --> 08:19.673
Well, lucky for you then that I
spoke to the lady on the corner.

08:19.673 --> 08:21.805
You know, the one who
sells jam door to door.

08:21.805 --> 08:23.372
Yeah.

08:23.372 --> 08:25.069
She says that her
company that she works for is

08:25.069 --> 08:26.897
looking for a secretary and

08:26.897 --> 08:29.857
I have got you an
interview tomorrow.

08:30.248 --> 08:33.077
The owner's name
is Otto Frank.

08:43.305 --> 08:44.785
Football assistant?

08:44.785 --> 08:46.830
Uh-hmm.
My school team.

08:46.830 --> 08:49.572
I, I sprained my ankle
so I helped the coach.

08:49.572 --> 08:51.531
Hmm.

08:51.531 --> 08:56.579
I was hoping for someone with a
bit more secretarial experience.

08:56.579 --> 08:58.625
Well, I had to keep
track of the schedule,

08:58.625 --> 09:01.453
so it had secretarial elements.

09:03.499 --> 09:05.588
As you can see,
I'm new to the language

09:05.588 --> 09:07.721
and the local customs so
it's important for me to...

09:18.819 --> 09:20.908
Which shows
that I'm a fast learner.

09:20.908 --> 09:23.693
I'm sure you are.

09:23.693 --> 09:26.217
And once we're up and running,
we'll need more people,

09:26.217 --> 09:29.177
so why don't you come
back in a few months?

09:29.481 --> 09:30.700
My parents are gonna
make me marry my brother

09:30.700 --> 09:32.267
if I don't get a job.

09:32.267 --> 09:34.356
But it, it's not as
bad as it sounds.

09:34.356 --> 09:35.836
I'm adopted.

09:35.836 --> 09:38.969
But still, would you
want to marry your brother?

09:38.969 --> 09:40.449
Don't answer that.

09:40.449 --> 09:42.059
I mean, I don't even know if
you have a brother, but,

09:42.059 --> 09:44.018
I don't mean it literally.

09:44.018 --> 09:47.282
I just, I just mean
I'm, I'm desperate.

09:49.371 --> 09:50.546
Oh.

09:50.546 --> 09:53.288
Yeah, I'm really not
getting this job, am I?

09:53.288 --> 09:54.898
Um, all right.

09:54.898 --> 09:56.552
Well, thanks.

09:56.552 --> 09:58.946
Thank you.

10:00.556 --> 10:03.733
Do you know
what pectin is?

10:04.604 --> 10:07.694
It's what you put in
jam to make it thicker.

10:07.694 --> 10:08.912
I'll work very hard.

10:08.912 --> 10:10.261
I won't let you down.

10:10.261 --> 10:14.135
Good.
Make jam.

10:16.354 --> 10:17.704
I don't understand.

10:17.704 --> 10:20.358
Directions
are on the box.

10:41.423 --> 10:43.686
It needs to be thicker.

10:46.080 --> 10:47.342
Good morning.

10:47.342 --> 10:49.561
Gooseberry is in the kitchen.

11:02.879 --> 11:05.012
Mmm. Too tart.

11:15.718 --> 11:18.199
You are here early.

11:18.547 --> 11:20.941
Raspberries today.

11:31.038 --> 11:32.735
This is perfect.

11:32.735 --> 11:34.171
Do you know how I know that?

11:34.171 --> 11:36.521
Because all I do is make jam.

11:36.521 --> 11:38.567
Well, I was hired
to be a secretary.

11:38.567 --> 11:39.916
Miep.

11:39.916 --> 11:41.570
And, yes, I'm
inexperienced, but how am

11:41.570 --> 11:44.225
I ever gonna get any experience
being stuck in, in the kitchen?

11:44.225 --> 11:46.096
You're not.
Yes, I am.

11:46.096 --> 11:48.620
And the phone never stops
ringing, the place is a mess,

11:48.620 --> 11:51.014
and I'm just stuck in
there chopping fruits.

11:54.670 --> 11:56.498
Answer it.

11:56.498 --> 11:58.152
Why?
Who is it?

11:58.152 --> 12:01.024
Answer it and find out.

12:01.764 --> 12:04.027
Opekta.

12:04.811 --> 12:05.986
Oh.

12:05.986 --> 12:08.553
Yeah, I'm, I'm very
sorry to hear that.

12:08.553 --> 12:10.904
How long, how long
did you simmer it for?

12:10.904 --> 12:12.470
Hmm.

12:12.470 --> 12:15.038
Yeah, no, you need to simmer
it for 30 minutes, at least.

12:15.038 --> 12:16.518
Yeah, as soon as it starts
sticking to the spoon,

12:16.518 --> 12:17.867
that's when it's nearly ready.

12:17.867 --> 12:21.088
All right. Okay.
Good luck. Bye.

12:21.697 --> 12:24.091
The housewives don't
always read the directions.

12:24.091 --> 12:25.353
They call and complain.

12:25.353 --> 12:27.181
That's why I
needed you to make jam.

12:27.181 --> 12:29.226
Oh.

12:29.226 --> 12:31.402
You'll be
answering phones now.

12:31.402 --> 12:33.013
I made a desk for you.

12:33.013 --> 12:34.536
Oh.

12:34.536 --> 12:36.103
Part of the experience
you lack is knowing how to

12:36.103 --> 12:37.800
talk to your employer.

12:37.800 --> 12:41.543
In the future, a more respectful
tone would be appreciated.

12:41.543 --> 12:43.763
I'm really sorry
I got angry.

12:43.763 --> 12:46.374
My mother says I do
have a temper.

12:46.374 --> 12:48.115
She also says I'm
really annoying.

13:01.606 --> 13:03.565
Miep!

13:03.565 --> 13:05.828
Tess!
Look what I got!

13:05.828 --> 13:07.525
Yes!

13:07.525 --> 13:08.744
Go on.

13:08.744 --> 13:12.269
All right. Mmm.

13:12.269 --> 13:14.837
Yes! Woo!

13:14.837 --> 13:16.970
Dancing? Shall we?

13:16.970 --> 13:19.668
I got a job.
We're celebrating.

13:19.668 --> 13:21.801
Race you.

13:41.298 --> 13:42.909
Hey, Jackie!

13:42.909 --> 13:44.127
Hello.

13:44.127 --> 13:45.825
There are no
decent guys in here.

13:45.825 --> 13:47.000
Who needs guys?

13:47.000 --> 13:48.871
Marriage is enslavement!

13:48.871 --> 13:49.916
Says who?

13:49.916 --> 13:52.396
Me.

13:54.877 --> 13:56.748
This is so jolly.

13:56.748 --> 13:59.186
Oh, what about him?

13:59.186 --> 14:00.883
I thought you
didn't need a man?

14:00.883 --> 14:02.189
I don't need one.

14:02.189 --> 14:03.190
I want one.

14:03.190 --> 14:04.800
And he's handsome.

14:04.800 --> 14:06.236
He's reading a book.

14:06.236 --> 14:07.411
He's shy.

14:07.411 --> 14:08.543
Or boring.

14:08.543 --> 14:10.806
How do I look?
Desperate.

14:10.806 --> 14:12.852
I'm going in.

14:16.333 --> 14:18.161
Hello.

14:18.161 --> 14:21.034
Hi. Hi. Hello.

14:22.078 --> 14:24.080
Fancy a drink?

14:24.080 --> 14:25.952
Um, of course.

14:25.952 --> 14:27.910
What, what would you like?

14:27.910 --> 14:29.738
No.
I'm getting you one.

14:29.738 --> 14:34.003
Come on.
Come on.

14:39.574 --> 14:41.489
What are you reading?

14:41.489 --> 14:43.447
Uh, rereading.

14:43.447 --> 14:46.363
It's just a bit of Kafka.

14:46.363 --> 14:48.626
<i>Metamorphosis.</i>

14:48.626 --> 14:51.455
What's it about?

14:51.455 --> 14:54.632
About a man who wakes up
one day and realizes he's a bug.

14:54.632 --> 14:56.504
Oh.

14:56.504 --> 14:58.549
Obviously,
it's a metaphor.

14:58.549 --> 15:01.813
Obviously.

15:01.813 --> 15:03.859
Don't mind if I do.

15:07.950 --> 15:10.866
It's about the absurdity of
life and the human condition.

15:10.866 --> 15:14.217
He was, he's a visionary.

15:21.355 --> 15:22.617
I'm just gonna
catch up with my friend.

15:22.617 --> 15:23.966
I'll see you in
a little while.

15:23.966 --> 15:26.360
Okay. I'll, I'll
just wait by the band.

15:26.360 --> 15:28.405
Great.

15:38.720 --> 15:40.678
You were right.
He was so boring.

15:40.678 --> 15:43.943
Let's go to a
bar with better men.

15:45.074 --> 15:46.989
I have to be
at work in an hour.

15:46.989 --> 15:49.774
Congratulations on
your new job, Jam-Making Girl.

15:49.774 --> 15:51.385
I love you.

15:51.385 --> 15:52.386
I'll see you later.

15:52.386 --> 15:54.736
Bye, Miep!

15:55.302 --> 15:57.304
Are these the
numbers from last week?

15:57.304 --> 15:58.914
Yes. Yes.

15:58.914 --> 16:02.004
The actual numbers
are in red and the
projections are in blue.

16:03.049 --> 16:04.180
This is good.

16:04.180 --> 16:06.008
Thank you.

16:06.008 --> 16:07.705
I meant Rotterdam.

16:07.705 --> 16:10.491
Oh, yes.
Rotterdam is doing very well.

16:10.491 --> 16:12.232
We need
more sales people.

16:12.232 --> 16:14.060
Maybe you should
put an ad in a paper.

16:14.060 --> 16:15.322
Oh, okay.

16:15.322 --> 16:16.671
Run it by me first.

16:16.671 --> 16:18.629
Of course.

16:18.629 --> 16:21.589
I meant to tell you
my friend, Hermann van Pels,

16:21.589 --> 16:25.288
he's developed a spice
blend for sausage-making.

16:25.288 --> 16:26.724
Uh-hmm.

16:26.724 --> 16:28.204
He's talking to me
about joining the company.

16:28.204 --> 16:30.206
If he does, we may need
to get more office space.

16:30.206 --> 16:32.252
Yeah. Yeah.
Great. Great.

16:33.166 --> 16:38.432
Well, thank you
for working with me, Miep.

16:38.432 --> 16:40.521
I'll see you tomorrow.

16:40.521 --> 16:43.350
It's your birthday!

16:43.350 --> 16:45.395
And your, your wife called
this morning and asked if

16:45.395 --> 16:47.876
I'd surprise you with a cake.

16:47.876 --> 16:49.834
Um, but we got really busy
and we worked through lunch,

16:49.834 --> 16:51.314
I didn't have time to go out.

16:51.314 --> 16:53.621
But there's a really nice
bakery just down there,

16:53.621 --> 16:57.277
so either you come with me
and I'll buy you a cake or

16:57.277 --> 16:59.670
please just explain to your wife
that I tried because, frankly,

16:59.670 --> 17:01.455
I find her quite scary.

17:01.455 --> 17:04.588
She's very intimidating.

17:06.329 --> 17:08.679
Let's go.

17:10.159 --> 17:11.291
Happy birthday.

17:11.291 --> 17:13.554
Thank you.

17:14.120 --> 17:16.774
I was 36 when we met.

17:16.774 --> 17:19.690
I was working in my
family's bank in Frankfurt.

17:20.474 --> 17:24.086
We got married, had the girls,
and bought a house.

17:24.086 --> 17:26.393
Life was good.

17:26.393 --> 17:30.179
Then the economy collapsed,

17:30.179 --> 17:32.877
the bank failed,

17:32.877 --> 17:36.316
and Hitler came to power.

17:37.491 --> 17:39.841
And...

17:39.841 --> 17:42.800
One day, I took Edith and
the girls to play tennis, and

17:42.800 --> 17:47.283
there was a sign on the court
that says "No Jews allowed."

17:53.855 --> 17:56.988
I have to look at my
family and say we can't play.

17:58.164 --> 18:01.341
Silly.

18:01.819 --> 18:05.432
It's tennis, I don't even
really like tennis but...

18:08.391 --> 18:12.787
for me, it was,
it was when I knew

18:12.787 --> 18:15.833
Germany wasn't my home anymore.

18:19.272 --> 18:21.665
I'm, I'm sorry.

18:21.665 --> 18:24.755
What, what were
we talking about?

18:24.755 --> 18:28.716
I, I asked you when
your family were moving here.

18:28.716 --> 18:31.545
Hmm. Sorry.

18:31.545 --> 18:34.156
Long-winded way of
saying next week.

18:34.156 --> 18:35.853
Oh. Really?

18:35.853 --> 18:37.203
Yeah.

18:37.203 --> 18:39.030
Of course, they're scared
to come even though

18:39.030 --> 18:40.684
it's much worse there.

18:40.684 --> 18:45.689
Every day another raid,
another anti-Jewish regulation.

18:48.866 --> 18:53.262
Mr. Frank, I really
didn't want to leave Vienna.

18:54.350 --> 18:58.006
My, my, my mom, my mother had
no husband and she was poor

18:58.006 --> 18:59.268
and I was malnourished.

18:59.268 --> 19:02.053
I was, I was only 10.

19:02.053 --> 19:06.928
And she found a Dutch family
who were willing to adopt me.

19:06.928 --> 19:08.973
And, and the day came that
I was supposed to leave and

19:08.973 --> 19:12.586
I hid under the bed so
that I missed the train.

19:14.414 --> 19:16.546
And she was begging me.

19:16.546 --> 19:18.200
Begging.

19:18.200 --> 19:21.160
Saying that my new family
had food and medicine and

19:21.160 --> 19:23.336
Holland would save my life.

19:23.336 --> 19:28.036
And she, she tried to climb
under the bed to drag me out

19:28.036 --> 19:30.256
but she couldn't reach me.

19:30.256 --> 19:34.042
She said later, actually,
that she'd almost given up.

19:35.043 --> 19:39.003
If she had, I probably
would have, would have died.

19:39.003 --> 19:41.702
I was so unwell.

19:46.097 --> 19:48.970
I'm sorry.

19:50.493 --> 19:52.234
Sometimes I think here's
this woman who made this

19:52.234 --> 19:56.238
huge sacrifice so I could live,
and I repay her by what?

19:56.238 --> 19:59.023
Forgetting her?

20:03.071 --> 20:06.248
It doesn't seem to me
that you've forgotten her.

20:11.253 --> 20:16.215
I think you pay her
back by living a life
worthy of her sacrifice.

20:21.437 --> 20:23.744
I'll try.

20:24.875 --> 20:27.704
Do you know how she eventually
got me out from under the bed?

20:27.704 --> 20:30.925
She, she told me that
my new family had a cat.

20:30.925 --> 20:32.318
Ah.

20:32.318 --> 20:33.971
So once I was on the
train she ran home and

20:33.971 --> 20:37.758
wrote to them and she suggested
that they get one, and they did.

20:54.165 --> 20:56.559
Hello, um, I'm looking
for Mrs. Vandenberg.

20:56.559 --> 20:59.170
I saw an ad
about some kittens.

20:59.170 --> 21:00.911
She's not here.

21:00.911 --> 21:03.436
Oh. Well, do you
know when she'll be back?

21:03.436 --> 21:05.394
She's my landlady.

21:05.394 --> 21:08.267
I don't keep track of
her comings and goings.

21:08.267 --> 21:12.053
If I did, I'd, I'd probably tell
her not to give you a kitten.

21:13.010 --> 21:14.969
Excuse me?

21:14.969 --> 21:17.101
Have I done
something to offend you?

21:17.101 --> 21:19.060
You ditched
me at Katty Korner.

21:19.060 --> 21:21.236
Oh.
Yeah.

21:21.236 --> 21:23.020
You're the man
who reads books in bars.

21:23.020 --> 21:24.326
Jan Gies.

21:24.326 --> 21:26.067
Right. Yes.

21:26.067 --> 21:27.242
Oh, God.

21:27.242 --> 21:28.765
That was bad form of me.

21:28.765 --> 21:30.637
I'm really sorry.

21:30.637 --> 21:33.727
I was only waiting
there for 30 minutes,

21:33.727 --> 21:34.858
twiddling my thumbs.

21:34.858 --> 21:36.033
You never showed up.

21:36.033 --> 21:37.121
At least
you had a book.

21:38.775 --> 21:42.388
Funny.
Have a nice day.

21:53.747 --> 21:56.445
You know
what your problem is?

21:56.445 --> 21:58.708
You don't have a sense of
humor, because what I just

21:58.708 --> 22:01.320
said was really funny.

22:01.320 --> 22:03.060
And the reason I ditched
you is because you were being

22:03.060 --> 22:06.281
pompous and you were lecturing
me like I was stupid.

22:06.281 --> 22:08.196
And I was actually going
through a really rough patch

22:08.196 --> 22:10.546
and I was tired of
being underestimated.

22:10.546 --> 22:13.723
But, again, sorry.

22:14.420 --> 22:17.292
I was nervous.

22:20.208 --> 22:22.906
I was going through
a rough time too.

22:22.906 --> 22:24.517
Then this girl appeared.

22:24.517 --> 22:26.388
Offered me back-alley brandy.

22:26.388 --> 22:29.391
I thought she was...

22:29.391 --> 22:31.393
I thought she was one of
the most beautiful girls

22:31.393 --> 22:34.353
I've ever seen.

22:35.789 --> 22:38.226
I didn't think
you were stupid.

22:38.226 --> 22:41.142
I thought you were
out of my league.

22:41.142 --> 22:43.274
Oh.

22:43.274 --> 22:47.409
Well, I can't walk away
in a huff now, can I?

22:47.409 --> 22:49.716
Not really.

22:49.716 --> 22:52.371
So I got married at 18 to
my high school sweetheart.

22:52.371 --> 22:57.158
And after a few years, well,

22:57.158 --> 23:00.161
I realized we actually didn't
have anything to talk about.

23:00.161 --> 23:03.338
And I was working at
a textile factory.

23:03.338 --> 23:04.513
And the money was good.

23:04.513 --> 23:07.603
The job was soul-destroying.

23:07.603 --> 23:10.519
I used to work next to this
bloke who was always going on

23:10.519 --> 23:13.435
about how much he hated his
life and why shouldn't he

23:13.435 --> 23:17.134
leave this place and go
traveling and move to America.

23:17.134 --> 23:19.441
And one day I snapped.

23:19.441 --> 23:21.965
I said, "Go on then. Leave."

23:21.965 --> 23:23.532
And he did.

23:23.532 --> 23:25.882
He left.

23:25.882 --> 23:31.888
And I thought I'd be over the
moon but I was actually jealous.

23:31.888 --> 23:33.977
Oh.

23:33.977 --> 23:36.240
I thought if I'm
so happy in my own life,

23:36.240 --> 23:37.720
why would I be
jealous of this guy?

23:37.720 --> 23:39.156
Uh-hmm.

23:39.156 --> 23:41.289
It's one of those
moments, you know,

23:41.289 --> 23:45.119
you realize you need
to change something.

23:45.119 --> 23:47.991
And the longer you leave it,
the harder it is.

23:47.991 --> 23:53.214
So that day I left my job.

23:53.214 --> 23:56.696
I went home and I asked
my wife for a divorce.

23:56.696 --> 23:58.480
Wow.
Yeah.

23:58.480 --> 24:00.482
You were the bug!

24:00.482 --> 24:02.005
The bug?
In the book.

24:02.005 --> 24:04.486
You woke up one day and
you turned into a bug.

24:04.486 --> 24:07.228
Yeah.
I was the bug, yes.

24:07.228 --> 24:11.493
That was when I became a
social worker, to help people.

24:12.538 --> 24:15.497
So did you
get a divorce?

24:15.497 --> 24:19.196
Yes.
Well, sort of.

24:19.196 --> 24:22.286
How do you
sort of get a divorce?

24:22.286 --> 24:24.506
We both agreed to
split and I started doing the

24:24.506 --> 24:27.857
paperwork, but then her mother
got sick so she suddenly had

24:27.857 --> 24:31.078
to leave town, and we
just haven't done it yet.

24:31.078 --> 24:32.819
Oh.

24:32.819 --> 24:36.083
But we're going to.

24:36.083 --> 24:39.260
You look like you don't
believe me but we really are.

24:39.260 --> 24:41.523
Is that what
you think this look is?

24:41.523 --> 24:43.786
Is it not?
No.

24:43.786 --> 24:45.701
What is it then?

24:45.701 --> 24:49.009
I was just wondering
if you kissed someone,

24:49.009 --> 24:52.055
would it be
considered infidelity?

24:52.055 --> 24:54.580
I don't know. Technically.

24:54.580 --> 24:56.886
Legally. Probably.

24:56.886 --> 25:00.411
Why?

25:11.814 --> 25:14.338
We just broke the law.

25:14.338 --> 25:15.601
Would you like to go
somewhere where we can

25:15.601 --> 25:17.167
break it some more?

25:17.167 --> 25:20.997
Yes.
Come on then.

25:22.825 --> 25:25.219
I'm afraid if I turn my
back on you, you'll disappear

25:25.219 --> 25:28.222
and I really don't want
you to go anywhere at all.

25:28.222 --> 25:31.747
I won't.
I need my kitten.

25:38.711 --> 25:39.799
Oh.

25:39.799 --> 25:41.365
Mrs. Frank.
I'm, I'm Miep.

25:41.365 --> 25:44.281
Miep.
Edith Hollander Frank.

25:52.028 --> 25:53.726
Come and see.

27:13.240 --> 27:14.850
I'm nervous.

27:14.850 --> 27:16.243
Don't be nervous.

27:16.243 --> 27:17.940
I want
everyone to like you.

27:17.940 --> 27:20.247
Oh, thanks very much.

27:20.247 --> 27:22.510
Your parents liked me,
didn't they?

27:22.510 --> 27:23.946
Yeah,
but that's different.

27:23.946 --> 27:25.165
This is my boss.

27:25.165 --> 27:27.297
And it's Shabbat dinner.
It's a big deal.

27:27.297 --> 27:29.299
Oh, don't mention
that you're married.

27:29.299 --> 27:30.779
Well, I'm,
I'm not married, am I?

27:30.779 --> 27:33.173
Separated and too lazy
to file the paperwork

27:33.173 --> 27:34.435
doesn't sound much better.

27:34.435 --> 27:35.697
Not too lazy.

27:35.697 --> 27:36.872
Too broke.

27:36.872 --> 27:38.831
Well,
definitely don't say that.

27:38.831 --> 27:40.833
What should I say then?

27:40.833 --> 27:42.486
How much I like his jam?

27:42.486 --> 27:43.618
It's not jam.

27:43.618 --> 27:44.967
It's, it's pectin.

27:44.967 --> 27:47.013
And Mr. Van Pels is
gonna be there, so.

27:47.013 --> 27:48.405
Oh, Sausage Man?

27:48.405 --> 27:51.713
Stop calling
him Sausage Man.

27:51.713 --> 27:53.802
Oh.

27:53.802 --> 27:55.630
You're cute
when you're nervous.

27:55.630 --> 27:56.805
I don't feel cute.

27:56.805 --> 27:58.372
I feel sweaty.

27:58.372 --> 27:59.982
These are really fancy people.

27:59.982 --> 28:03.246
Oh, and they're all Jewish,
so don't mention you know who.

28:03.812 --> 28:04.987
Hitler's a narcissist.

28:04.987 --> 28:06.336
It's all ego.

28:06.336 --> 28:09.078
He's child trapped
in a man's body.

28:09.078 --> 28:10.210
Who are
we talking about?

28:10.210 --> 28:11.602
Who do you think?

28:11.602 --> 28:12.865
Oh, do we
have to talk about him?

28:12.865 --> 28:14.867
The man gives me indigestion.

28:14.867 --> 28:17.652
Your Miep was just
educating us to why she thinks

28:17.652 --> 28:19.088
we're safe here in Holland.

28:19.088 --> 28:20.350
I'm telling you,
he won't come here.

28:20.350 --> 28:21.569
We're neutral.

28:21.569 --> 28:22.744
You're being naive.

28:22.744 --> 28:24.093
Oh, let her
make her point, Hermann.

28:24.093 --> 28:25.616
Thank you,
Mrs. Van Pels.

28:25.616 --> 28:28.315
We were neutral in the Great War
and the Queen just issued

28:28.315 --> 28:30.186
a statement saying
we remain neutral.

28:30.186 --> 28:31.710
Oh, so that's it?

28:31.710 --> 28:34.582
That's your argument, a
press release by a figurehead.

28:34.582 --> 28:36.149
You really are naive, Miep.

28:36.149 --> 28:37.803
Let's be nice to Miep.

28:37.803 --> 28:39.805
What's not nice about
telling Miep she's being naive

28:39.805 --> 28:43.678
to think that Hitler cares
about the Queen's proclamation?

28:43.678 --> 28:45.419
She's your
queen now too, Hermann.

28:45.419 --> 28:47.943
And if she
were here, I'd tell her
what I'm telling you.

28:47.943 --> 28:50.337
Hitler's objective is France.

28:50.337 --> 28:51.817
And to get around
the Maginot Line,

28:51.817 --> 28:53.993
he needs to go through
the Netherlands.

28:53.993 --> 28:57.823
So neutral or not, if France
declares war on Germany,

28:57.823 --> 28:59.912
he is coming.

28:59.912 --> 29:00.956
Well, then we'll fight.

29:00.956 --> 29:02.784
With what? Cheese?

29:02.784 --> 29:04.394
The Dutch aren't
equipped for war.

29:04.394 --> 29:05.787
The Dutch look
out for each another.

29:05.787 --> 29:06.788
It's not Germany.

29:06.788 --> 29:08.181
This country saved my life.

29:08.181 --> 29:11.140
No. Your adoptive
parents saved your life.

29:11.140 --> 29:13.012
A country is made
up of people, Miep.

29:13.012 --> 29:16.363
And people, even the good,
loving wooden-shoe-wearing

29:16.363 --> 29:19.366
people of your beloved Holland
will be no match for Hitler

29:19.366 --> 29:22.021
when, not if,
he comes and attacks.

29:22.021 --> 29:25.459
So, Hermann,
my love, my very grumpy,

29:25.459 --> 29:29.724
cynical doomsday darling,
what do you propose we do?

29:29.724 --> 29:31.944
Oh, I have no answers
or the answers I have aren't

29:31.944 --> 29:33.380
the ones you wanna hear.

29:33.380 --> 29:35.817
Well, Otto thinks
we should move to America.

29:35.817 --> 29:38.341
And
what do you think?

29:39.081 --> 29:42.476
Well, I think America
sounds far away and I'm hoping

29:42.476 --> 29:45.696
that Miep is right, that he'll
leave the Netherlands alone.

29:45.696 --> 29:47.916
I mean, I finally
learned the language,

29:47.916 --> 29:49.962
with much difficulty.

29:49.962 --> 29:51.790
"Dear Adolf Hitler,
please stay away from

29:51.790 --> 29:55.837
Amsterdam because our dear Edith
can't possibly learn to say

29:55.837 --> 29:58.622
'May I have some champagne'
in any other languages."

29:58.622 --> 30:00.755
Oh.

30:01.060 --> 30:03.584
Nobody's eating my cheese
balls except the nice,

30:03.584 --> 30:05.455
quiet Dutchman.

30:05.455 --> 30:07.806
What do you think, Jan?

30:07.806 --> 30:11.157
Do you think Hitler will
invade the Netherlands?

30:13.637 --> 30:17.467
I think...

30:18.164 --> 30:21.123
I think these are
delicious, Mrs. Frank.

30:21.863 --> 30:23.256
See?
A true Dutchman.

30:23.256 --> 30:24.953
He knows how to
stay out of a fight.

30:24.953 --> 30:27.434
He's a good diplomat.

30:42.666 --> 30:44.407
I can't believe this.

30:44.407 --> 30:45.974
What, five days.

30:45.974 --> 30:48.890
The Dutch fought for five days
and then just surrendered.

30:48.890 --> 30:51.893
And the Queen just fled
to London, left us here.

30:53.460 --> 30:55.854
Wait. Where are you going?

30:55.854 --> 30:58.769
To work.
Today?

30:58.769 --> 31:01.511
We have a new office,
new employees.

31:01.511 --> 31:04.036
We have to work.

31:05.080 --> 31:06.734
I'm sorry.

31:06.734 --> 31:08.692
I, I didn't think
this would happen.

31:08.692 --> 31:11.695
I didn't understand.

31:12.044 --> 31:16.135
Well, now you do.

31:39.419 --> 31:40.376
Morning, Miep.

31:40.376 --> 31:41.725
Morning Bep.

31:41.725 --> 31:44.511
Morning,
Mr. Kugler, Mr. Kleiman.

31:44.511 --> 31:46.252
Is our fearless leader in?

31:46.252 --> 31:48.297
Yes.
And he's in a mood.

31:48.297 --> 31:50.604
Uh-oh.
What?

31:50.604 --> 31:52.606
Oh, dear.

31:52.606 --> 31:54.956
We have a very
dissatisfied customer.

31:54.956 --> 31:57.828
"Dear The Terrible Makers
of This Terrible Product.

31:57.828 --> 32:01.049
I tried to use your product
and it was a dismal failure.

32:01.049 --> 32:04.313
Even my husband, who will eat
anything, including head cheese,

32:04.313 --> 32:06.315
tried it and
found it disgusting.

32:06.315 --> 32:08.230
The banana jam I
made was inedible."

32:08.230 --> 32:10.232
Well, banana jam
does sound disgusting.

32:16.456 --> 32:18.501
Let's not forget that
the woman you're laughing at

32:18.501 --> 32:20.808
pays our bills.

32:25.639 --> 32:27.771
You know, I told you about
the guy that Nellie was seeing.

32:27.771 --> 32:28.903
Uh-hmm.

32:28.903 --> 32:29.991
Well, you'll
never guess what.

32:29.991 --> 32:31.732
Willie is seeing him too.

32:31.732 --> 32:33.473
What?
Yeah.

32:33.473 --> 32:37.172
Miep, could you come see
me before you leave please?

32:44.223 --> 32:46.355
I won't keep you long.
I'm sure you have plans.

32:46.355 --> 32:47.835
Oh, just some
drinks with a friend.

32:47.835 --> 32:51.273
Ah. Sit.

32:54.798 --> 32:56.670
I'm really sorry
about what happened earlier.

32:56.670 --> 32:57.758
I feel terrible.

32:57.758 --> 33:00.239
No, it's fine.

33:01.109 --> 33:02.937
Miep.

33:02.937 --> 33:05.548
Yes?

33:09.335 --> 33:13.643
I read this today from
an old friend, Nathan Straus.

33:13.643 --> 33:15.428
We went to
Heidelberg together.

33:15.428 --> 33:17.386
He's American but he
was there for a year.

33:17.386 --> 33:18.997
Oh.

33:18.997 --> 33:21.869
Nathan now works in the
Roosevelt administration and

33:21.869 --> 33:25.699
he wants to sponsor my family
and me to come to America.

33:25.699 --> 33:28.354
Oh.
So you're leaving?

33:28.354 --> 33:31.009
No.

33:31.618 --> 33:34.447
This letter says that, um,

33:34.447 --> 33:37.406
my application for a
visa was turned down.

33:38.625 --> 33:41.410
It seems even my
well-connected friend

33:41.410 --> 33:45.893
cannot pry open the door
to America for my family.

33:50.811 --> 33:54.075
We have to get out but
there's nowhere to go.

33:56.686 --> 33:58.819
Um, I'm so sorry.

33:58.819 --> 34:01.430
I, I didn't realize it
had gotten to this point.

34:01.430 --> 34:03.563
No.

34:03.563 --> 34:07.088
I didn't want to bring
my troubles to work.

34:08.307 --> 34:09.656
I wanted to keep
you out of it.

34:09.656 --> 34:13.747
But it's not possible anymore.

34:21.668 --> 34:26.064
Miep, what I want to ask you,

34:26.064 --> 34:28.936
it's too much.

34:28.936 --> 34:32.809
I have no right but
I also have no option.

34:32.809 --> 34:35.160
What is it?

34:35.160 --> 34:38.119
We are
going into hiding.

34:38.119 --> 34:39.294
Not right away.

34:39.294 --> 34:40.643
I still have a lot to plan.

34:40.643 --> 34:42.254
Where?

34:42.254 --> 34:45.692
It's better if you know
as little as possible right now.

34:45.692 --> 34:47.650
But when get there,
we'll need your help

34:47.650 --> 34:49.043
getting food and medicine.

34:49.043 --> 34:50.088
Whatever you need.

34:50.088 --> 34:52.960
Let me finish please.

34:59.184 --> 35:03.101
What I am asking you
to do is dangerous.

35:04.798 --> 35:09.759
If you get caught, you could
get arrested or even worse.

35:12.458 --> 35:15.504
Don't answer right away.

35:15.504 --> 35:18.246
You need to take your
time to think it through.

35:18.246 --> 35:21.597
You need to talk
it over with Jan.

35:21.597 --> 35:24.209
No, I don't.

35:24.209 --> 35:27.342
I don't.

35:32.565 --> 35:35.394
What do I do?

35:49.451 --> 35:51.801
For right now, you go
have drinks with your friend

35:51.801 --> 35:55.240
and you act as if
nothing has happened.

35:59.069 --> 36:00.723
You enjoy yourself.

36:00.723 --> 36:02.682
You laugh and you act
like you know nothing.

36:02.682 --> 36:05.815
And one day it will seem
as if we disappeared,

36:05.815 --> 36:08.340
and you will still
go for drinks,

36:08.340 --> 36:12.126
and laugh and act as if
nothing has happened.

36:12.822 --> 36:16.130
Even after many drinks.

36:16.130 --> 36:19.568
Even if your friend
is a trusted friend.

36:22.658 --> 36:25.792
Hi.
I am so sorry.

36:25.792 --> 36:27.881
Did you forget?
No. No.

36:27.881 --> 36:30.100
I was leaving work and
a client held me up.

36:30.100 --> 36:31.276
Right.
You forgot.

36:31.276 --> 36:32.668
That's fine.

36:32.668 --> 36:34.148
What's this?

36:34.148 --> 36:35.802
Well, I wasn't even
sure if you wanted gifts,

36:35.802 --> 36:40.241
but it felt strange not to
give you something.

36:43.766 --> 36:49.119
Wow.
Tess, it's beautiful.

36:49.119 --> 36:50.991
I love it.

36:50.991 --> 36:53.211
Good.

36:53.907 --> 36:55.909
Oh, please
don't be angry.

36:55.909 --> 36:58.346
My best friend
gets married and I hear
about it afterwards.

36:58.346 --> 36:59.565
You were out of town.

36:59.565 --> 37:01.480
For a month.
You couldn't wait?

37:01.480 --> 37:02.872
It was barely a wedding.

37:02.872 --> 37:05.135
You have to believe me
when I say it was nothing.

37:05.135 --> 37:07.486
We got married
for my citizenship.

37:07.486 --> 37:10.619
We did it in the records
office on my lunch break.

37:11.272 --> 37:13.970
That's romantic.

37:13.970 --> 37:15.885
Did you have a party?

37:15.885 --> 37:17.060
No, no, no, no.

37:17.060 --> 37:18.323
Anne was the flower girl.

37:18.323 --> 37:19.541
My parents came.

37:19.541 --> 37:20.803
Cas was there.

37:20.803 --> 37:22.892
But, seriously, that was it.

37:22.892 --> 37:25.808
And I love this bowl, more
than I've ever loved anything,

37:25.808 --> 37:27.680
except you.

37:27.680 --> 37:28.811
Do you love me
more than you love your

37:28.811 --> 37:30.291
stupid new husband?

37:30.291 --> 37:31.553
Oh, my God.

37:31.553 --> 37:33.163
Of course.

37:33.163 --> 37:34.643
Okay. Fine.

37:34.643 --> 37:36.471
I forgive you for
being a terrible friend.

37:36.471 --> 37:38.299
Thank you.

37:38.299 --> 37:41.302
How's work?
Fine.

37:41.302 --> 37:43.609
How's Mr. Frank?
He's fine.

37:43.609 --> 37:45.045
'Cause I hear they're
cracking down on the Jews.

37:45.045 --> 37:46.699
It must be scary.

37:46.699 --> 37:49.397
Um, I mean, we don't
really talk about that

37:49.397 --> 37:51.660
kind of stuff, to be honest.

37:51.660 --> 37:53.880
Tell me about your new
fabulous boyfriend

37:53.880 --> 37:56.448
who owns a country house?

37:59.451 --> 38:00.974
Don't even
get me started.

38:00.974 --> 38:02.323
I can't wait for
you to meet him.

38:02.323 --> 38:04.325
What happened
to the ice cream shop?

38:04.325 --> 38:06.414
What, you didn't hear?

38:06.414 --> 38:08.242
Oh, my God.

38:08.242 --> 38:10.157
So these Nazis came in and
they were harassing these

38:10.157 --> 38:12.159
Jewish customers and the owner
got so upset about it,

38:12.159 --> 38:14.683
he sprayed ammonia
in their faces.

38:14.683 --> 38:16.337
They dragged him out to the
street and they shot him

38:16.337 --> 38:17.556
right here.

38:17.556 --> 38:19.340
They killed him?
Yeah.

38:19.340 --> 38:21.037
I can't believe you
didn't hear about it.

38:21.037 --> 38:23.257
That's awful.

38:23.257 --> 38:25.346
I mean,
he did break the law.

38:25.346 --> 38:27.609
Yeah,
but it's a stupid law.

38:27.609 --> 38:29.219
Yeah, I know.

38:29.219 --> 38:31.483
It's just, I just think that,
there are ice cream shops in

38:31.483 --> 38:33.049
all the Jewish neighborhoods,

38:33.049 --> 38:36.705
so, I mean, how hard can it be
for them to just go there?

38:49.414 --> 38:51.241
<i>QUEEN WILHELMINA [over radio]:
Our enemy occupies...</i>

38:51.241 --> 38:53.374
Hello, Missus... Shh.

38:53.374 --> 38:55.681
The Queen is talking.

38:55.681 --> 38:58.161
<i>QUEEN WILHELMINA [over radio]:
Destruction and utter
disregard of law</i>

38:58.161 --> 39:00.773
<i>as basic principles of morality</i>

39:00.773 --> 39:02.122
How is Tess?

39:02.122 --> 39:03.210
Annoying.

39:03.210 --> 39:04.516
She gave us a bowl.

39:04.516 --> 39:08.171
Uh-hmm.
That's nice.

39:08.868 --> 39:11.827
Mrs. Stoppelman
is listening to the BBC.

39:13.002 --> 39:14.308
I know.

39:14.308 --> 39:16.658
It's illegal.

39:17.050 --> 39:21.097
Well, they'll have
to drag her out before
she gives up her BBC.

39:21.097 --> 39:22.969
They might.

39:22.969 --> 39:25.537
They might drag us away too.

39:27.713 --> 39:30.237
What's wrong?

39:30.237 --> 39:32.674
Koco's is closed.

39:32.674 --> 39:34.633
They killed the owner.

39:34.633 --> 39:36.809
I know.

39:36.809 --> 39:38.419
You knew about this?

39:38.419 --> 39:40.639
Yeah.

39:40.639 --> 39:42.815
It was in the paper.

39:42.815 --> 39:46.427
Heartless fascists.

39:46.427 --> 39:48.908
Yeah, well.

39:49.343 --> 39:51.040
What's that
supposed to mean?

39:51.040 --> 39:52.302
Nothing.

39:52.302 --> 39:53.956
Just, you're right.

39:53.956 --> 39:55.436
They're heartless.

39:55.436 --> 39:58.221
You said, "Yeah, well,"
like he deserved it.

39:58.221 --> 39:59.875
Like he broke the law so
he deserves to get killed.

39:59.875 --> 40:01.050
Real, really?

40:01.050 --> 40:02.965
You discerned all
that from my yeah, well?

40:02.965 --> 40:04.445
You just
don't seem very upset.

40:04.445 --> 40:06.142
No, no.
Here's what happened.

40:06.142 --> 40:10.538
I was sleeping and you came home
irritated at your best friend

40:10.538 --> 40:15.282
and the landlady and now me,
whom you seem to

40:15.282 --> 40:19.155
suddenly see as
callous and unfeeling.

40:20.026 --> 40:22.463
Is there
something else going on?

40:22.463 --> 40:24.465
Did something happen at work?

40:25.597 --> 40:26.815
No.

40:26.815 --> 40:30.384
It's just a weird day.

40:30.819 --> 40:33.169
Go back to sleep.

40:39.480 --> 40:41.743
Sorry I'm late.
Checkpoint was crazy.

40:41.743 --> 40:43.136
But I've got the fish.

40:43.136 --> 40:46.226
I'll debone it, but first,
I need to use the loo.

40:46.226 --> 40:49.664
We have a visitor.

40:53.712 --> 40:55.278
Mr. Van Pels?

40:55.278 --> 40:57.019
Margot got a letter
ordering her to report to the

40:57.019 --> 41:00.153
train station in the
morning to be sent to
a work camp in Germany.

41:00.153 --> 41:02.155
What?

41:02.155 --> 41:03.548
The
plan has moved up.

41:03.548 --> 41:05.637
They're going into
hiding tomorrow.

41:05.637 --> 41:08.901
We have to go now.

41:12.818 --> 41:14.863
We don't want to
believe people are evil.

41:14.863 --> 41:17.823
That makes us good but
it also makes us stupid.

41:17.823 --> 41:20.434
So we need to
stop being stupid.

41:20.434 --> 41:22.567
Hey, Jew!
Curfew in 30 minutes.

41:22.567 --> 41:24.960
Yes, sir.
Thank you, sir.

41:27.833 --> 41:29.269
What does that mean?

41:29.269 --> 41:32.794
Roughly translated,
"Go shit in the ocean."

41:32.794 --> 41:34.840
Okay. I have to go.

41:34.840 --> 41:36.885
Otto will tell you what
needs to be done.

41:36.885 --> 41:39.148
Go.

41:40.976 --> 41:43.065
I wasn't
planning to go for weeks.

41:43.065 --> 41:44.458
Oh, there you are.

41:44.458 --> 41:45.938
Thank God.

41:45.938 --> 41:47.374
We didn't have a chance to
bring all our clothes to the

41:47.374 --> 41:50.682
hiding places, so we have
to put them all on now.

41:50.682 --> 41:52.422
Wear all these clothes
to your apartment tonight.

41:52.422 --> 41:54.512
You can bring them to us
later at the hiding place.

41:54.512 --> 41:55.730
Here are
the good towels.

41:55.730 --> 41:56.992
Oh, how are
we gonna bring those?

41:56.992 --> 41:58.385
Margot, go get
one of your rucksacks.

41:58.385 --> 41:59.647
Okay.

41:59.647 --> 42:01.214
Something bigger.
A suitcase perhaps.

42:01.214 --> 42:02.389
Oh, no. A suitcase
will draw too much attention.

42:02.389 --> 42:04.565
You may need to
make several trips.

42:04.565 --> 42:06.567
Where's Anne?

42:06.567 --> 42:07.829
Anne?

42:07.829 --> 42:09.439
She's still
mad about the cat.

42:09.439 --> 42:11.920
What about the cat?

42:11.920 --> 42:14.227
You know, they
won't even tell me where
it is we're going.

42:14.227 --> 42:16.577
All they've said is I
can't bring Moortje.

42:16.577 --> 42:18.884
And when I get upset,
they tell me to grow up.

42:18.884 --> 42:20.755
Well, then stop
treating me like a child.

42:20.755 --> 42:22.278
I'll find a
good home for him.

42:22.278 --> 42:24.150
I promise.

42:24.150 --> 42:25.543
I'm not leaving him.

42:25.543 --> 42:26.979
I'm not.

42:26.979 --> 42:28.415
They can go but I'm staying.

42:28.415 --> 42:29.895
Anne.
Girls!

42:29.895 --> 42:31.461
Girls, come.
We're going tonight.

42:31.461 --> 42:32.550
We're going tonight.

42:32.550 --> 42:33.768
Edith, listen to me.

42:33.768 --> 42:34.900
You said we'd
be safe in Holland.

42:34.900 --> 42:36.118
You have to calm down.

42:36.118 --> 42:37.032
I'm done with
listening to you, Otto.

42:37.032 --> 42:38.338
I want to go tonight.

42:38.338 --> 42:39.948
We can't go tonight.
There's a curfew.

42:39.948 --> 42:41.689
We should have
gone when we had a chance.

42:41.689 --> 42:43.125
We should have
gone to America.

42:43.125 --> 42:44.213
We tried.

42:44.213 --> 42:45.650
We should've
tried harder!

42:45.650 --> 42:47.086
Edith, please.
You're not thinking straight.

42:47.086 --> 42:48.957
Of course I'm not
thinking straight, when my

42:48.957 --> 42:51.307
16-year-old daughter
is going to her death.

42:51.307 --> 42:52.439
She's not going.

42:52.439 --> 42:54.049
This isn't
a work camp, Otto.

42:54.049 --> 42:55.703
It's a death camp, I...

42:55.703 --> 43:00.055
The children are here!

43:00.534 --> 43:02.623
Edith, they're children.

43:02.623 --> 43:05.931
Please, they don't
need to hear this.

43:10.326 --> 43:13.112
Maybe she's right.

43:13.112 --> 43:15.680
Maybe we should go tonight.

43:17.986 --> 43:19.814
We'll all go
together in the morning.

43:19.814 --> 43:22.121
You can't.

43:22.121 --> 43:24.602
Sorry.

43:25.254 --> 43:28.214
Maybe it's not my place
but you can't go together.

43:28.562 --> 43:30.825
If you're together and they
stop you and they see that

43:30.825 --> 43:32.740
Margot hasn't reported
to the station,

43:32.740 --> 43:34.524
they'll arrest all of you.

43:34.524 --> 43:36.439
So be it.

43:36.439 --> 43:38.050
Mr. Frank,
Margot has still...

43:38.050 --> 43:41.270
You're right.
It's not your place.

43:41.270 --> 43:43.925
I'll take her
to the hiding place.

43:47.581 --> 43:51.585
In the morning, I'll take her.

44:32.147 --> 44:35.150
So are you
going to tell me?

44:40.025 --> 44:42.462
He's my
boss and my friend.

44:42.462 --> 44:44.159
I'm your husband.

44:44.159 --> 44:45.508
I never wanted the kind
of marriage where I had to

44:45.508 --> 44:47.032
consult my husband
about everything.

44:47.032 --> 44:48.381
Ah.

44:48.381 --> 44:49.948
What, what kind of
marriage did you want then?

44:49.948 --> 44:53.125
One where you lie to your
husband and it doesn't matter?

44:53.125 --> 44:55.431
I didn't ask you to
help because, like I said,

44:55.431 --> 44:56.911
I don't need your help.

44:56.911 --> 44:59.261
You don't need my help?
You don't need my help?

44:59.261 --> 45:03.570
And then when you're arrested,
taken to a concentration camp,

45:03.570 --> 45:06.225
you're gonna be all right
on your own, won't you?

45:06.225 --> 45:08.183
Can we not
have this argument?

45:08.183 --> 45:10.272
It's the right thing to do
and I've agreed to do it,

45:10.272 --> 45:12.100
and I didn't think I had to
consult you before deciding to

45:12.100 --> 45:13.580
save a person's life.

45:13.580 --> 45:16.148
Who the hell do
you think you are?

45:16.148 --> 45:18.063
The only person with morals?

45:18.063 --> 45:20.543
What would you have
me do when Mr. Frank asked?

45:20.543 --> 45:21.893
Say no?

45:21.893 --> 45:24.069
Ask, ask me.
That's what I'd have you do.

45:24.069 --> 45:25.635
Stop being selfish.

45:25.635 --> 45:27.376
Think about someone
besides yourself.

45:27.376 --> 45:29.030
How dare you.

45:29.030 --> 45:31.206
No, no, no.
How, how dare you.

45:31.206 --> 45:34.688
You live in this, this fantasy
that you're, you're all alone

45:34.688 --> 45:36.821
and your, you, your mother
abandoned you and your new

45:36.821 --> 45:39.998
family didn't understand
you and poor Miep has no one.

45:39.998 --> 45:41.782
You cling to it.

45:41.782 --> 45:45.220
But I'm here.
I'm right here.

45:45.220 --> 45:47.309
You don't even see me.

45:47.309 --> 45:49.834
You don't see me.

45:49.834 --> 45:52.010
Stop shouting at me.

46:10.419 --> 46:12.465
I'm crawling out
of my skin, I'm so hot.

46:12.465 --> 46:15.511
Come here.

46:38.752 --> 46:41.973
It feels so good.

46:51.069 --> 46:54.333
Can we just not
think about tomorrow?

46:59.555 --> 47:00.687
I'm sorry.

47:00.687 --> 47:03.516
It's all right.
I'm sorry.

47:51.216 --> 47:54.001
How many of these
have you got on?

47:54.001 --> 47:56.569
Take them off.

48:37.218 --> 48:38.611
Next!

48:38.611 --> 48:39.655
What are you doing?
I'm thinking.

48:39.655 --> 48:42.180
Just give me a second.

48:44.834 --> 48:46.967
Okay.

48:46.967 --> 48:48.273
Here's what's gonna happen.

48:48.273 --> 48:49.317
I need you to talk to me.

48:49.317 --> 48:50.753
Just tell me
something, anything.

48:50.753 --> 48:53.017
Like, like what?

48:53.017 --> 48:54.540
It doesn't matter,
just talk, just talk like you
don't have a care in the world

48:54.540 --> 48:56.063
and smile at the same
time and follow me.

48:56.063 --> 48:57.238
Miep.
I can't. I can't.

48:57.238 --> 48:58.326
Yes, you can.
Miep. No.

48:58.326 --> 48:59.458
You have to.

48:59.458 --> 49:02.678
I'm not,
I'm not like Anne, okay?

49:02.678 --> 49:03.766
I'm not brave.

49:03.766 --> 49:05.159
So tell me about it.

49:05.159 --> 49:07.770
But just get on your
bike and follow me, Margot.

49:08.206 --> 49:11.818
Tell me what is Anne like?

49:12.253 --> 49:14.560
She's, she's opinionated
and, and she's funny.

49:14.560 --> 49:15.865
And she has a
boyfriend and I don't.

49:15.865 --> 49:16.954
Smile.

49:16.954 --> 49:17.998
I don't
have a boyfriend.

49:17.998 --> 49:19.304
Yeah. What else?

49:19.304 --> 49:20.044
And, you know,
she knows who she is.

49:21.697 --> 49:23.743
She's, she's only 13 and
she wants to be a famous writer.

49:23.743 --> 49:27.051
And I'm 16 and I don't have
any idea of who I want to be.

49:27.051 --> 49:28.226
Halt!

49:28.226 --> 49:29.401
Sorry. Sorry.

49:29.401 --> 49:30.706
My tire's flat and
we're late for work.

49:30.706 --> 49:32.534
My boss will kill
us if we're late.

49:32.534 --> 49:35.015
So sorry.

49:35.276 --> 49:36.799
Is he following us?

49:36.799 --> 49:38.714
Don't look back.

49:57.472 --> 49:58.952
Why are
we at the office?

49:58.952 --> 49:59.953
Shh.

49:59.953 --> 50:01.607
Miep.

50:01.607 --> 50:04.436
You'll see.

50:05.176 --> 50:07.004
Tell me
what's going on.

50:07.004 --> 50:09.615
You'll see.
Just put your bike there.

50:09.615 --> 50:12.966
What, I
don't understand.

50:15.969 --> 50:18.363
What is this?

50:18.798 --> 50:21.844
Come on. Come on.
We'll talk upstairs.

50:24.238 --> 50:26.806
There are small set of rooms
behind your father's office.

50:26.806 --> 50:28.068
No one goes there.

50:28.068 --> 50:30.636
No one even
knows they're there.

50:34.074 --> 50:36.816
Come on. Careful.

50:36.816 --> 50:39.036
They're steep.

50:39.036 --> 50:41.560
Where are we going?

50:46.478 --> 50:48.480
Take off your coat.

50:48.480 --> 50:51.048
Take it off.

50:51.048 --> 50:52.919
This is the hiding place.

50:52.919 --> 50:54.442
But we have clients and
salespeople in and out of the

50:54.442 --> 50:56.053
building all day.

50:56.053 --> 50:57.402
There's a
meeting this morning.

50:57.402 --> 50:59.056
They'll be here in 30 minutes.

50:59.056 --> 51:01.145
So you have to be quiet.

51:01.145 --> 51:03.886
You can't walk or talk
or make any noise at all.

51:03.886 --> 51:06.585
You can't open the windows
and you can't use the loo.

51:06.585 --> 51:08.369
I know this is a
lot to take in.

51:08.369 --> 51:11.242
Your family will be here
later and we'll make
this place into a home.

51:11.242 --> 51:13.766
If you need to cry, cry now.

51:13.766 --> 51:16.638
You have 30 minutes.

51:16.638 --> 51:19.250
I'll be back later
to check on you.

51:19.946 --> 51:24.255
Margot, we made it.
You're safe.

51:25.473 --> 51:27.997
Yeah.

52:43.638 --> 52:45.466
I thought you were gone.

52:45.466 --> 52:47.686
I woke up, I thought
you were gone.

52:47.686 --> 52:48.904
I'm sorry.

52:48.904 --> 52:50.123
I'm sorry I didn't
wake you and tell you.

52:50.123 --> 52:51.994
I'm sorry.
I'm, I'm so selfish.

52:51.994 --> 52:53.561
No, you're not.

52:53.561 --> 52:55.868
You're not selfish.

52:56.129 --> 52:58.000
Look at what you just did.

53:01.047 --> 53:03.528
Look at what you just did.

53:13.407 --> 53:15.801
