Female computer voice:
Pudding.

18:59.938 --> 19:01.139
Aw, damn it, barry!

19:01.141 --> 19:02.907
You put pudding in my head!

19:02.909 --> 19:04.442
Putting pudding.

19:05.444 --> 19:09.013
Or, putting pudding.

19:09.015 --> 19:11.249
I was gonna say,
"the future is now."

19:11.251 --> 19:13.484
"the future is now"?

19:13.486 --> 19:15.887

19:17.623 --> 19:18.990
Excuse me, guys.

19:18.992 --> 19:20.858
I think the computer
just read his thoughts.

19:22.327 --> 19:23.961
We did it!
Oh, my god.

19:23.963 --> 19:25.129
We did it!
It worked.

19:25.131 --> 19:27.198

Female computer voice:
Stop thinking about sex.

19:34.274 --> 19:37.575
Baseball. Boobs. Boobs.
Baseball. Baseball.

19:40.279 --> 19:42.880
Female computer voice:
This was a great idea, walden.

19:42.882 --> 19:46.017
It was.
You're so beautiful.

19:46.019 --> 19:49.887
Thank you.
And you're so handsome.

19:49.889 --> 19:52.390

20:16.783 --> 20:20.851
Last man picked
and I have an unwanted boner.

20:20.853 --> 20:22.920
I wouldn't say it's unwanted.

20:25.057 --> 20:27.058
Oh. Hello.

20:27.060 --> 20:30.361
Well, looks like
it's just you and me.

20:30.363 --> 20:33.097
Yeah... Jeff probst

20:33.099 --> 20:34.131
Bastard.

20:34.133 --> 20:36.434
He's my grandson.

20:36.436 --> 20:40.438
Wow! Uh, I-I-I can't believe
he'd bring his grandmother

20:40.440 --> 20:41.672
To a party like this.

20:41.674 --> 20:45.142
(chuckling):
He can't bring me
to my own party.

20:45.144 --> 20:46.744
Wait, but this is your house?

20:46.746 --> 20:47.745
That's right.

20:47.747 --> 20:48.779
What do you say?

20:48.781 --> 20:51.515
You want to go road test
this new hip?

20:53.051 --> 20:55.319
All right. Why not?
