WEBVTT

00:50.356 --> 00:51.687
This is ground control.

00:51.758 --> 00:55.694
Citation Zebra-Bravo is landing
on runway 3-0, right.

00:55.862 --> 00:58.763
Police and security
to full alert immediately.

01:38.838 --> 01:42.103
Rolex watch. You know the name,
now own the watch.

01:42.175 --> 01:44.666
You little rascal, running away like that.

01:45.411 --> 01:48.972
Are you seeing how he is running around?
He is programmed to be doing that.

01:49.048 --> 01:52.711
This, this is a highly sophisticated robot
for $19.95, no tax.

01:52.785 --> 01:53.683
Please note.

01:53.753 --> 01:56.847
Uncle, are you wanting to buy?
There's no obligation.

01:56.923 --> 01:57.981
You can just look.

01:58.057 --> 02:01.049
Rolex watch. You know the name,
now own the watch.

02:01.127 --> 02:03.322
The ultimate Swiss craftsmanship.

02:03.897 --> 02:06.559
You see these fine chronometers
on sale at Tiffany's...

02:06.633 --> 02:07.930
for $1,700.

02:08.133 --> 02:09.294
I deal in volume.

02:09.369 --> 02:12.429
My special price to you today, $39.95.

02:12.705 --> 02:14.832
How you gonna beat that?

02:14.908 --> 02:17.706
You gonna beat that?
How are you gonna beat that?

02:17.944 --> 02:19.707
How's your line moving, pal?

02:19.879 --> 02:22.712
They are not selling like pancakes,
that is for certain.

02:22.782 --> 02:25.876
Maybe I should be
selling them door-to-door?

02:26.419 --> 02:29.786
Door-to-door? In this town?
You just fall off the banana boat...

02:29.856 --> 02:30.856
or what?

02:30.924 --> 02:33.017
I do not travel with bananas, sir.

02:33.092 --> 02:37.620
I've been kicking around here
for two days' time already.

02:37.764 --> 02:38.958
Really?

02:42.202 --> 02:45.000
- Interested in upgrading your image?
- Up my image?

02:45.071 --> 02:48.040
I am gonna let you have
half of my inventory.

02:48.107 --> 02:49.904
What would you say to that?

05:00.239 --> 05:01.706
Look at that!

05:08.514 --> 05:11.677
Wait, Mr. Slater, look.
You haven't seen this.

05:12.151 --> 05:14.984
You haven't seen this before. Check it out.

05:15.521 --> 05:19.013
Look, see, they're hands. They clap.

05:19.459 --> 05:23.418
- I know it will sell.
- Sandy, we don't sell novelty items here.

05:23.629 --> 05:26.223
Now, how many chances
am I supposed to give you?

05:26.299 --> 05:27.960
I told you I want high-tech...

05:28.034 --> 05:29.296
and I want it now.

05:29.369 --> 05:32.133
For Christmas, not Easter, got it?

05:32.972 --> 05:34.564
Yes, sir. High-tech.

05:35.508 --> 05:37.339
I'll can the hat and keep looking.

05:37.410 --> 05:41.744
And if you don't mind, Miss Banatoni,
some of us are trying to work.

05:42.849 --> 05:44.111
That's better.

05:47.019 --> 05:49.317
Silence is better than Little Richard?

05:55.828 --> 05:58.991
I can let you have these
rock-bottom wholesale. You'll clean up.

05:59.065 --> 06:01.124
That's nice, but I'm occupying myself...

06:01.200 --> 06:03.691
But the toy robot business, it's pathetic.

06:03.770 --> 06:06.261
They're not gonna move. Not in this town.

06:06.339 --> 06:07.897
Excuse me, is this yours?

06:08.941 --> 06:11.603
Yes. It is called Number Five.

06:11.811 --> 06:13.870
It rolled past my office. Listen...

06:13.946 --> 06:16.710
Excuse me. My friend and I
were taking a meeting here.

06:16.783 --> 06:18.114
Who are you?

06:18.184 --> 06:20.118
Sandy Banatoni, Assistant Buyer...

06:20.186 --> 06:22.677
Simpson's Toy Department. Okay?

06:22.889 --> 06:23.981
- Listen....
- Hello.

06:24.056 --> 06:25.717
- These are great toys.
- Thank you.

06:25.792 --> 06:28.317
My boss loves it. Where did you get them?

06:28.394 --> 06:30.259
Well, I am making them.

06:30.329 --> 06:34.129
I am Ben Jahrvi, Titanic Toy Corporation.

06:34.567 --> 06:35.693
Like the ship.

06:35.768 --> 06:38.498
Sorry, I haven't heard of you.
Where are you located?

06:38.571 --> 06:41.699
Actually, I am based
in that vehicle right over yonder.

06:41.841 --> 06:45.038
Oh, no. I mean, where's your
assembly plant? Your offices?

06:45.111 --> 06:48.103
Well, you are also there.
That's also my home.

06:49.148 --> 06:52.549
You mean, you make these yourself?
In there?

06:52.919 --> 06:56.320
Yes, you see robotics
is the only livelihood I am knowing.

06:56.389 --> 06:58.084
Are you wanting to purchase one?

06:58.157 --> 07:00.148
You see the hands, they bend like that.

07:00.226 --> 07:02.888
We deal in volume.
I couldn't possibly order...

07:02.962 --> 07:04.554
less than 1,000.

07:04.630 --> 07:05.961
- 1,000?
- 1,000.

07:06.032 --> 07:08.159
1,000? We could do 1,000.

07:08.234 --> 07:10.964
No perspiration,
if the per unit price is attractive.

07:11.037 --> 07:13.005
What? Who are "we"?

07:13.072 --> 07:15.836
We could go maybe, $50 apiece?

07:15.942 --> 07:18.035
Oh, no, I am only charging $19.95.

07:18.110 --> 07:22.069
A day, to rent.
If you want to buy them wholesale...

07:22.148 --> 07:23.809
we could live with $50 apiece.

07:23.883 --> 07:25.009
Okay, maybe.

07:25.084 --> 07:28.349
But seriously, I mean, how long before
you could deliver that many?

07:28.421 --> 07:31.151
You just want a rough estimate
of how long....

07:31.257 --> 07:33.020
Yes. 1,000 robots, well...

07:33.092 --> 07:36.220
This is a ballpark figure, you know.
We'll round it off.

07:37.029 --> 07:40.123
They could be ready for delivery
in the middle of October.

07:40.199 --> 07:40.961
Really?

07:41.033 --> 07:42.125
1993.

07:42.535 --> 07:43.695
Rolex!

07:44.203 --> 07:45.602
Get a Rolex watch.

07:46.572 --> 07:49.439
Look, I'm sorry for wasting your time.

07:49.642 --> 07:51.906
We're in two different worlds here.

07:51.978 --> 07:54.947
I mean, I'd have to have them
in, like, 30 days.

07:55.014 --> 07:56.242
30 days?

07:56.449 --> 07:57.609
I'm sorry.

07:57.683 --> 07:59.082
Well, wait a minute.

07:59.151 --> 08:02.712
You know, he meant
with our current facilities, but we...

08:02.788 --> 08:04.619
could expand our operation.

08:04.690 --> 08:07.659
You know, we can get more personnel,
a larger factory.

08:07.727 --> 08:10.161
Once we get a cash advance,
we'd be in high gear.

08:10.229 --> 08:12.220
You are saying this "we" word, sir.

08:12.298 --> 08:14.232
My boss wouldn't give a cash advance.

08:14.300 --> 08:17.064
All right, for Simpson's
we'll forego the cash advance.

08:17.303 --> 08:18.634
How does this sound?

08:18.704 --> 08:21.400
We will show up at your door
October 15 this year...

08:21.474 --> 08:24.102
with 1,000 of these.
You guarantee to buy them?

08:24.176 --> 08:25.609
$50 apiece, COD?

08:27.380 --> 08:28.711
Okay.

08:28.781 --> 08:30.510
Get your lawyers on the paperwork.

08:30.583 --> 08:32.847
- We got a deal.
- We got a deal. Thank you.

08:32.919 --> 08:34.784
- Thanks.
- We are making a deal.

08:34.854 --> 08:37.254
This is most pleasant deal. Pleasing.

08:37.523 --> 08:39.683
I'm studying with fever
to become citizen...

08:39.759 --> 08:42.352
of your country 'tis of thee. Yes, sir.

08:42.428 --> 08:44.760
You are appreciating my robots?

08:45.498 --> 08:48.626
- Did you ask me a question?
- Benny, merchandise is running away.

08:48.701 --> 08:51.169
- Get back here, you are grounded!
- 'Bye now.

08:51.237 --> 08:54.035
I'm going to take your batteries out.
Bad boys.

08:54.540 --> 08:55.734
First things first.

08:55.808 --> 08:57.503
Before the first thing is a question:

08:57.577 --> 08:59.442
Who are you and what is your name?

08:59.512 --> 09:01.742
Fred Ritter.
I'm in the entrepreneur business.

09:01.814 --> 09:04.374
I ask financial questions like,
"where's your capital?"

09:04.450 --> 09:06.042
Washington, DC.

09:06.752 --> 09:08.447
Right. Simple words.

09:08.654 --> 09:11.646
How will you build all those robots
by yourself with no money?

09:11.724 --> 09:15.353
I am thinking I will contact my friends
Newton and Stephanie in Montana.

09:15.428 --> 09:17.055
Perhaps they can help me financially.

09:17.129 --> 09:18.892
Montana? You got friends here.

09:18.965 --> 09:21.365
I got you your big break.
Tell me what you need.

09:33.279 --> 09:34.837
Oscar, step aside.

09:51.163 --> 09:53.154
Mr. De Ruyter,
may I have a word with you?

09:53.232 --> 09:56.963
Mr. De Ruyter, welcome to the US,
and welcome to First Federal Trust.

09:57.036 --> 09:59.800
It's an honor for all of us at the bank,
and I'd like...

09:59.872 --> 10:01.863
Might we step inside, please?

10:01.941 --> 10:03.568
Oh, yes. Yes, indeed.

10:17.623 --> 10:19.181
Madson steel alloy.

10:19.358 --> 10:21.019
- A-450.
- Well, of course.

10:21.127 --> 10:25.063
Built by Heimdall. Completely custom.
I must say we're really...

10:25.264 --> 10:27.061
quite proud of it.

10:41.380 --> 10:45.009
Gentlemen, the Vanderveer Collection.

10:48.421 --> 10:52.016
We'll keep them here until one day
before the exhibition is to open...

10:52.091 --> 10:53.718
at the museum.

10:57.196 --> 11:01.690
Of course, during the day we'll have
a special detail of six armed guards.

11:02.301 --> 11:06.032
At night, they'll be augmented
by 12 strategically placed...

11:06.572 --> 11:08.096
security personnel.

11:08.174 --> 11:10.904
- Excellent.
- I'm glad you approve.

11:14.447 --> 11:16.642
You already owe a substantial sum, Fred.

11:16.716 --> 11:19.276
- It's due in 30 days.
- Mr. Arnold, I'm aware of that.

11:19.351 --> 11:21.444
But it takes money to make money.

11:21.520 --> 11:24.785
And this is a sure thing.
With this, I am guaranteed in the black.

11:24.857 --> 11:27.724
And your money,
your interest is in your pocket, in full.

11:27.793 --> 11:29.761
On time, no bullshit.

11:29.862 --> 11:34.356
And this time, I have great collateral:
55 Rolex watches.

11:34.967 --> 11:37.492
You know the name, now own the watch.

11:39.472 --> 11:43.704
I know the name, Fred.
And your body is your collateral.

11:47.379 --> 11:48.175
Now...

11:48.280 --> 11:50.407
this doesn't change
our original contract.

11:50.483 --> 11:51.415
Absolutely not.

11:51.484 --> 11:53.679
- You still owe me everything.
- Absolutely.

11:53.986 --> 11:55.112
In 30 days.

11:55.421 --> 11:56.421
30 days.

11:58.824 --> 12:01.759
This is it.
Your new factory, rented just for you.

12:01.861 --> 12:03.829
Oh, baprai! Right here?

12:04.563 --> 12:06.963
This is why I am studying
to become citizen...

12:07.032 --> 12:08.465
of your great country.

12:08.534 --> 12:12.368
In one day's time only,
a man can go from a mean street corner...

12:12.471 --> 12:15.372
like this one,
to a skyscraping building like that one.

12:15.441 --> 12:17.636
What are you talking about? Not the bank.

12:17.710 --> 12:19.075
180, over here.

12:22.014 --> 12:26.348
Mid-town, centrally located.
Been here since 1902.

12:26.552 --> 12:27.814
Beautiful, huh?

12:27.887 --> 12:30.185
An historic building. Come on.

12:35.561 --> 12:37.119
It's unbelievable, isn't it?

12:37.196 --> 12:40.996
They're tearing it down soon,
so I sweet-talked them into a short lease.

12:41.066 --> 12:44.194
- Really?
- Got it for a song. It'll work though, right?

12:44.270 --> 12:47.171
I mean, it's got everything we need.
It's got...

12:47.339 --> 12:49.466
walls and windows.

12:49.975 --> 12:53.411
Phone service.
All the square footage you could ask for.

12:53.679 --> 12:54.407
Arey.

12:54.480 --> 12:56.948
Benny, I'd like you to meet
your production staff.

12:57.016 --> 12:59.541
They're fast learners,
they're hard workers.

12:59.618 --> 13:01.142
Minimum wage.

13:01.320 --> 13:04.016
Here's your budget
for tools and parts and all that.

13:04.089 --> 13:06.523
I promised our staff a three-course dinner.

13:06.592 --> 13:08.958
Got my favorite table
reserved at McDonald's.

13:09.028 --> 13:10.359
Excuse me.

13:12.231 --> 13:14.597
How are you obtaining
this financial funding?

13:14.667 --> 13:17.067
A little muscle, a whole lot of hustle.

13:17.269 --> 13:18.668
Everybody get a watch?

13:18.737 --> 13:20.500
I got a watch.

13:22.074 --> 13:24.065
- You like McNuggets?
- Who is he?

13:24.243 --> 13:25.505
Trust me.

13:37.389 --> 13:39.118
I don't believe it.

13:39.225 --> 13:39.692
Well, this is just great!

13:39.693 --> 13:42.786
Well, this is just great!

13:42.895 --> 13:45.420
Who the hell are they?
Nobody's supposed to be here.

13:45.497 --> 13:46.691
Slow down, Saunders.

13:46.765 --> 13:48.858
I knew I should have
stayed away from this.

13:48.934 --> 13:49.798
So leave!

13:49.869 --> 13:53.396
Go back to your two-bit computer scam
you were doing so good.

13:53.472 --> 13:54.370
All right.

13:54.440 --> 13:57.739
- How much time do we need?
- You gotta be kidding.

13:58.510 --> 14:00.444
We're not past the utility lines yet.

14:00.512 --> 14:02.480
The soil density is lower than I thought.

14:02.548 --> 14:04.539
We'll have to shore every five feet.

14:04.617 --> 14:07.017
There's no way we'll get
to the jewels before...

14:07.086 --> 14:08.417
How much time?

14:25.671 --> 14:28.265
If we have to stop digging
for more than five days...

14:28.340 --> 14:30.035
we'll never make it in time.

14:30.109 --> 14:34.239
We have to get them out of here,
or we can kiss those diamonds good-bye.

14:34.546 --> 14:36.741
Benny, where did you get the idea for this?

14:36.815 --> 14:37.474
No.

14:37.549 --> 14:39.540
Split conductor cable, remember?

14:39.618 --> 14:42.416
Before I arrived in this city,
I was working in Oregon...

14:42.488 --> 14:43.750
for Nova Robotics.

14:43.822 --> 14:46.552
My friend Newton Crosby and I
designed and built...

14:46.625 --> 14:48.252
the real Number Five robot.

14:48.327 --> 14:51.660
Unfortunately, the military got hold of him
and decided to use him...

14:51.730 --> 14:53.823
as a weapon of death and destruction.

14:53.899 --> 14:55.890
You were making these things for real?

14:55.968 --> 14:58.402
And now you're making toys for a living?

14:59.038 --> 15:02.496
Well, the real Number Five,
he malfunctioned and....

15:02.708 --> 15:06.337
Well, let us just say
that we were separated from our jobs.

15:06.912 --> 15:09.380
When you complete this robot,
we will have 25.

15:09.448 --> 15:10.938
Voila, my man.

15:11.250 --> 15:12.581
Number 25.

15:17.323 --> 15:18.323
24.

15:20.526 --> 15:25.361
Excuse me, sir, but we are not open
to the public. Hello. Can l...

15:27.566 --> 15:29.397
Hey, come on now, guys!

15:29.501 --> 15:32.800
You're jumping the gun here.
Arnold said I got 29 more days.

15:32.871 --> 15:34.634
Hey, watch the silk!

15:35.841 --> 15:37.638
Come on, let's do it!

15:39.445 --> 15:42.141
No, sir, please don't touch that!

15:45.084 --> 15:47.211
No, please don't leave!

15:48.854 --> 15:52.153
Don't forget the circuit tester.

15:52.291 --> 15:54.191
Not the circuit tester!

15:54.293 --> 15:56.818
Oh, now, Fred, get up! You're chicken?

16:06.839 --> 16:08.500
You must learn to defend yourself.

16:08.574 --> 16:11.236
But who would do this
to struggling business persons...

16:11.310 --> 16:12.174
like us?

16:12.244 --> 16:15.441
- I thought it was somebody I knew.
- No, wait, sir!

16:16.048 --> 16:18.209
Now we are un-employers.

16:19.284 --> 16:21.514
We still have the robot parts and the van.

16:21.587 --> 16:22.986
I'll get a new staff together.

16:23.055 --> 16:26.218
But we have no more money.
And now we're having no equipment.

16:26.291 --> 16:29.783
To assemble robots with our naked hands
would be slower than...

16:29.862 --> 16:31.921
than moles' asses in January.

16:33.899 --> 16:36.834
Benny? You're leaving me with my back
to the wall here.

16:36.902 --> 16:38.665
We gotta come up with something!

16:38.737 --> 16:40.705
Not possible. We're the type of people...

16:40.773 --> 16:43.105
who have everything going against us.

16:43.175 --> 16:45.302
Look. How about this? How about we...

16:45.377 --> 16:48.540
go to the lady at Simpson's
and we beg for an advance?

16:48.614 --> 16:52.380
I mean, we go in there and we grovel.
We look really pathetic.

16:52.785 --> 16:56.152
Mountain Lion Air Freight.
We got a delivery for you.

16:57.356 --> 16:58.618
Oh, yeah?

16:59.324 --> 17:02.122
We've had enough deliveries
for one day, pal.

17:02.294 --> 17:04.285
Mr. Benjamin Jarvee, right?

17:04.396 --> 17:05.396
Jahrvi.

17:05.464 --> 17:07.625
We should leave it out here or what?

17:07.699 --> 17:09.530
Leave it out there.

17:23.615 --> 17:25.742
It's for you. Who even knows you're here?

17:25.818 --> 17:28.810
I have only told my friends in Montana.

17:33.992 --> 17:36.187
I've never seen that happen before.

17:36.695 --> 17:38.526
What the hell is this crap?

17:39.598 --> 17:42.123
Who is caring? This crap is moving!

17:57.749 --> 17:59.216
Hello, bozos!

17:59.885 --> 18:03.013
Benjamin! Come here. Give me a hug.

18:03.122 --> 18:05.090
It's so good to see you!

18:05.324 --> 18:06.256
Number Five!

18:06.325 --> 18:09.453
For you, from Stephanie.
All-natural granola brownies.

18:09.795 --> 18:11.422
No preservatives or additives.

18:11.497 --> 18:13.556
That's the real one! The real Number Two!

18:13.632 --> 18:15.361
Number Five!

18:15.434 --> 18:17.425
Please, call me Johnny Five.

18:17.503 --> 18:19.869
Johnny? You have taken name
for yourself?

18:19.938 --> 18:23.704
I choose many things for myself,
but did not choose travelling in a box.

18:24.009 --> 18:27.103
I choose to fly tourist class,
but they say I'm cargo.

18:27.246 --> 18:29.840
No movie, no magazine, no bag of peanuts.

18:29.915 --> 18:32.645
What are you doing here?
I am not understanding.

18:32.784 --> 18:33.784
Listen.

18:35.020 --> 18:37.818
" Dear Ben, we decided that
the only way we could help...

18:37.890 --> 18:39.482
"was to send Number Five.

18:39.558 --> 18:41.822
" He can build your robots,
but you know how...

18:41.894 --> 18:45.057
"crazy he is for input,
so keep an eye on him. Good luck.

18:45.130 --> 18:46.688
" Love, Stephanie and Newton."

18:46.765 --> 18:50.257
Benjamin, this is your home,
domicile, flophouse?

18:50.702 --> 18:54.103
Fred, Lady Luck,
she is sitting in our laps today.

18:54.206 --> 18:57.198
She is? I thought you said
this thing misfunctioned on you.

18:57.276 --> 18:59.437
That's a falsity.
What really happened was...

18:59.511 --> 19:02.639
we were working on him
and suddenly he was struck by lightning.

19:02.714 --> 19:04.739
And from this moment on...

19:05.117 --> 19:08.450
he has a mind of his own.
So the government tried to destroy him.

19:08.520 --> 19:11.956
So he ran away. So now he is living
with my friend in Montana...

19:12.024 --> 19:14.584
in a cabin, in the woods, incognito.

19:15.327 --> 19:16.351
Input!

19:16.595 --> 19:18.586
Hound of the Baskervilles.

19:24.002 --> 19:25.970
I think the chauffeur did it.

19:29.875 --> 19:31.069
He did.

19:31.276 --> 19:34.541
Listen very carefully.
I am thinking we should not tell him...

19:34.613 --> 19:36.547
he is in major metropolitan area.

19:36.615 --> 19:39.209
If he is discovering
he is in a city full of input...

19:39.284 --> 19:41.013
he will go insanely crazy.

19:41.086 --> 19:42.986
You mean this thing runs by itself?

19:43.055 --> 19:47.082
Thing? An object without life,
a personal possession? Incorrect.

19:47.259 --> 19:48.954
Johnny Five not a thing.

19:49.027 --> 19:52.656
Right. What I mean,
is it remote-controlled, or what?

19:53.332 --> 19:56.665
Well, you would not believe me.

19:57.236 --> 19:58.396
Number Five?

19:58.971 --> 20:00.268
Johnny Five.

20:00.472 --> 20:02.497
Johnny is a very cute name.

20:02.574 --> 20:04.599
- I like it.
- Come here. Come on.

20:04.676 --> 20:06.200
This is my friend, Fred.

20:06.278 --> 20:07.176
Hello, Fred.

20:07.246 --> 20:09.146
- No, over here.
- Right. Sorry.

20:09.214 --> 20:12.047
Perhaps Fred would like
a demonstration of just how...

20:12.117 --> 20:14.347
you'll help us out
of this predicament...

20:14.419 --> 20:15.909
we are stuck inside of.

20:15.988 --> 20:18.183
- Here, please assemble.
- Sure.

20:18.257 --> 20:20.054
Okay, check diagram, right.

20:20.492 --> 20:24.326
Okay, find tread assembly, right.

20:24.630 --> 20:27.656
Attach serve linkage
to motor and solder there.

20:27.733 --> 20:30.668
Insert tab A into slot B.
Put that down there...

20:30.736 --> 20:33.637
and don't forget the nernies. Okay...

20:33.905 --> 20:37.432
and back to this, and that lower boom,
and attach the screws here...

20:37.509 --> 20:41.172
and tighten A and B, and tighten C, D.
Put the neck assembly down...

20:41.246 --> 20:45.012
to split wire connectors,
and attach at points X and Y....

20:45.083 --> 20:47.244
It's me! Isn't that special?

20:47.352 --> 20:50.446
We're home free!
It could build them all, right?

20:55.227 --> 20:56.626
What is it?

21:00.165 --> 21:03.066
And now, the next set of parts....

21:12.744 --> 21:14.974
Completed Number 74, Benjamin.

21:15.881 --> 21:17.143
Benjamin?

21:17.249 --> 21:20.685
The government is divided into three trees.

21:21.787 --> 21:23.186
Branches.

21:24.089 --> 21:27.786
We'll return to Tarzan the Fearless
after these messages.

21:27.926 --> 21:31.123
Like I said,
it's the all-new Radio Shack stereo...

21:31.196 --> 21:35.189
and just look at these prices!
I admit it...

21:35.267 --> 21:38.259
I need therapy.
But till I'm cured, you can save big!

21:38.337 --> 21:41.829
So, come on, take advantage
of Manic Mike's emotional problems.

21:41.907 --> 21:45.673
I just got to sell! I can't help it.
Look at me. I'm in a panic.

21:45.744 --> 21:48.440
I'm frantic and I'm manic!

21:48.580 --> 21:50.445
Wow, nutso.

21:50.882 --> 21:52.349
Interesting human.

21:58.123 --> 22:00.091
It's incredible!

22:00.792 --> 22:03.886
They have got a robot
doing all the work for them.

22:03.995 --> 22:06.156
Operating completely unsupervised.

22:06.231 --> 22:09.029
A totally mobile,
independent robotics system!

22:09.101 --> 22:11.194
Saunders, are they moving out or not?

22:11.269 --> 22:12.463
Are you kidding?

22:12.537 --> 22:15.097
What we smashed is worth
nothing compared to that.

22:15.173 --> 22:17.903
These guys must be loaded.
Why are they in that building?

22:17.976 --> 22:19.500
They probably bought it.

22:19.578 --> 22:21.978
Okay, so we get rid of the robot.

22:27.652 --> 22:31.349
Benjamin? Wake up call.

22:38.330 --> 22:40.890
Up and at 'em, Benjamin.
Time for recharging.

22:40.999 --> 22:42.432
Good morning.

22:42.501 --> 22:44.901
You have an alternative power supply?

22:44.970 --> 22:47.530
Lithium-argon liquid battery.
Good for 500 hours.

22:47.606 --> 22:49.870
Improvement on your design.
Got the bugs out.

22:49.941 --> 22:52.842
Yes, and I'm proud of you.
You removed your laser weapon.

22:52.911 --> 22:56.540
Weapon is to kill, disassemble, make dead.
Unacceptable.

22:56.681 --> 22:59.616
You have made many modifications
upon your person.

22:59.684 --> 23:02.653
You have come a long way
from a Defense Department prototype.

23:02.721 --> 23:06.623
You betcha! It's the all-new Johnny Five.
Just look at these items!

23:06.725 --> 23:08.989
Increased memory, 500 megabytes on-line.

23:09.060 --> 23:11.927
I come with a utility pack
and gadgets for outdoor living.

23:11.997 --> 23:14.363
Lots of Greenpeace stickers
and even a Nike swoosh!

23:14.433 --> 23:16.526
If you act now, I'll throw in for free...

23:16.601 --> 23:19.434
my all-new multi-frequency
remote control!

23:26.611 --> 23:28.306
You're a crazy man, huh?

23:30.449 --> 23:32.474
There's a guy trying to sleep up here.

23:32.551 --> 23:34.382
"I can't help it. I'm in a panic.

23:34.453 --> 23:38.321
"I'm frantic and I'm manic!"

23:38.390 --> 23:41.985
Fred, it is time to wake up.
The early bird gets worms.

23:42.427 --> 23:44.258
What is the time being?

23:44.329 --> 23:46.695
- 8:37 a.m. And 17 seconds.
- Oh, my God.

23:47.299 --> 23:50.166
I'm supposed to go to Simpson's
to sign the papers.

23:50.268 --> 23:53.203
Benjamin! I'll go with you.
I'd love more input.

23:53.305 --> 23:55.034
Oh no, Johnny Five, you...

23:55.106 --> 23:57.939
must wait here. You stay here.

23:58.009 --> 24:00.603
There is nothing outside.
It's very boring out there.

24:00.679 --> 24:02.340
Everything you need is here.

24:02.414 --> 24:03.676
I'll be back soon.

24:03.748 --> 24:06.376
It is very boring out there. No input.

24:06.451 --> 24:08.248
Boring.

24:08.487 --> 24:11.479
Dubious. Hard to believe.

24:11.556 --> 24:14.684
- Excuse me.
- Hi. Mr. Jarvee, right?

24:14.759 --> 24:17.592
Jahrvi, but you can call me B-E-N.
I spell it Ben.

24:17.662 --> 24:19.527
Ben, hi. So, how's it going?

24:19.598 --> 24:21.088
Great.

24:21.833 --> 24:23.027
This is for you.

24:23.101 --> 24:24.693
- Ben, it looks great.
- Thank you.

24:24.769 --> 24:27.067
This looks even better than your prototype.

24:27.138 --> 24:29.902
You can mass produce
at this quality and still meet...

24:29.975 --> 24:31.237
our deadline?

24:31.309 --> 24:32.105
Yes.

24:32.177 --> 24:34.839
Great. Why don't you go down
and see my secretary...

24:34.913 --> 24:36.540
about signing the papers?

24:36.615 --> 24:38.014
I don't know why.

24:38.517 --> 24:41.486
- No, I mean, you should go...
- I mean, yes.

24:41.553 --> 24:45.489
Okay. Good, well, so good luck
with the rest of them and...

24:45.590 --> 24:47.387
we'll be in touch.

24:51.796 --> 24:55.892
" Please won't you be my neighbor?"

24:55.967 --> 24:57.195
Hi, neighbor.

24:57.369 --> 25:00.395
I've been thinking about you,
and I thought you...

25:00.505 --> 25:03.201
might like to see Hisher Boot-trunk.

25:04.209 --> 25:06.541
Hisher is a ventriloquist's dummy.

25:06.678 --> 25:09.306
He isn't alive. I'm alive.

25:09.414 --> 25:11.439
I'm a human being like you.

25:12.150 --> 25:15.347
Hisher is made
of papier-mache and wood...

25:15.720 --> 25:19.952
and except for pretend,
Hisher doesn't have feelings.

25:20.725 --> 25:22.317
I have feelings.

25:23.862 --> 25:25.921
I have skin and bones....

25:26.598 --> 25:29.726
Hey, gently with the shirt.
That's my Bisana.

25:30.268 --> 25:34.466
It's a $190 shirt.
I got it for $45.50 off the truck.

25:36.508 --> 25:38.533
You want to hand me the Labatts?

25:38.944 --> 25:40.002
Sure.

25:40.345 --> 25:42.779
I wouldn't want you to strain yourself.

25:42.914 --> 25:44.905
Can you say "thank you"?

25:45.250 --> 25:48.845
Why don't you see if you can hunt up
some more of those cashew nuts?

25:48.920 --> 25:50.512
There's somebody at the door.

25:50.589 --> 25:53.387
Wash his socks, iron his shirts....

25:54.192 --> 25:56.558
Just like animals in a jungle,
I swear to God.

25:56.628 --> 26:00.120
The people in this city,
it's like back-to-the-trees time.

26:00.432 --> 26:01.432
City?

26:02.267 --> 26:03.894
I am in a city?

26:04.102 --> 26:05.501
I didn't say that.

26:05.837 --> 26:08.067
This is actually no place at all.

26:09.374 --> 26:11.001
You shouldn't waste your time.

26:11.076 --> 26:13.271
There's really nothing to see out there.

26:13.345 --> 26:16.906
I mean, well, you can see for yourself.
It's pretty dull, actually.

26:20.118 --> 26:22.712
It's not much of a place
to see, really, is it?

26:22.787 --> 26:24.414
Major metropolis!

26:24.956 --> 26:26.947
Come on, now. We got toys to make.

26:27.025 --> 26:29.118
Was not told I was in a city. Why?

26:29.194 --> 26:30.752
Look, just get back to work!

26:30.829 --> 26:32.228
You're ordering me?

26:32.297 --> 26:35.266
I'm not Slave-O-Matic.
I'm Johnny Five. I'm alive.

26:35.333 --> 26:38.461
And my Aunt Bertha is a toaster oven.
Come on, get to work!

26:38.536 --> 26:40.663
I've never seen a city.
Time for sightseeing.

26:40.739 --> 26:42.866
Sightseeing? You don't need to sightsee.

26:42.941 --> 26:43.999
Excuse me.

26:55.787 --> 26:59.723
Input. Megabytes of input.

27:00.759 --> 27:02.158
Watch your toes.

27:02.293 --> 27:05.353
Look at this place. It's amazing!

27:07.165 --> 27:10.100
It's like Montana, only vertical.

27:12.537 --> 27:17.770
Buildings, skyscrapers, urban habitats.
I am impressed.

27:21.846 --> 27:23.313
Mobile human.

27:26.551 --> 27:28.576
Woman carrying a dead animal.

27:29.954 --> 27:31.387
Outdoor plumbing.

27:33.525 --> 27:34.719
Oh, my.

27:36.728 --> 27:38.127
Must be Candid Camera!

27:38.196 --> 27:40.460
It must take batteries or something,
you know?

27:40.532 --> 27:41.328
Hot dogs!

27:41.399 --> 27:44.232
Pork snouts, nitrates, red dye number five.

27:46.571 --> 27:50.507
Hello, there, pedestrians, city dwellers,
young urban professionals.

27:50.742 --> 27:52.710
Nice place you got here.

27:54.946 --> 27:56.573
Human porcupines.

27:58.717 --> 27:59.717
Smile!

28:01.653 --> 28:03.518
What's going on?

28:06.925 --> 28:08.392
Keep your eye on it.

28:08.460 --> 28:11.520
Okay, red to black, red to black. Red card.

28:11.596 --> 28:13.928
Everybody can play, okay?
Winners all the time.

28:13.998 --> 28:17.092
Here we go. Red to black,
red to black. Red card.

28:17.168 --> 28:20.160
- Okay, pick that card up.
- That one. I win.

28:22.340 --> 28:24.638
What the hell am I looking at here?

28:24.709 --> 28:25.937
Look, it's a droid.

28:26.010 --> 28:27.978
Kiss off, you bug-eyed geek. Come on!

28:28.046 --> 28:30.480
- I did not win?
- Who's running this thing?

28:30.548 --> 28:33.711
Get this ugly mother out of my face!

28:34.719 --> 28:37.153
Well, excuse me for living.

28:37.822 --> 28:41.622
Los Locos kick your ass!
Los Locos kick your face!

28:41.893 --> 28:45.659
Los Locos kick your balls into outer space!

28:46.097 --> 28:48.622
That thing ain't gonna work
on this lock, sucker.

28:48.700 --> 28:52.033
Push on the window. Push, man!

28:53.104 --> 28:54.628
I'll unlock it.

28:55.740 --> 28:56.740
It's a droid!

28:56.775 --> 28:59.608
- Is he a cop, man?
- No, man, I seen that shit before.

28:59.677 --> 29:04.410
I seen it too. It's a Mitsubishi!

29:04.616 --> 29:07.278
Not Mitsubishi. I'm Johnny Five.

29:07.585 --> 29:09.018
He's talking, man.

29:09.420 --> 29:14.221
Sure, they all do that, man.
Hey, what are you doing here?

29:14.492 --> 29:17.325
I'm sightseeing,
but many people are angry.

29:17.462 --> 29:18.258
Why?

29:18.329 --> 29:20.854
Is that your car, man?
You're looking out for it?

29:20.932 --> 29:21.796
No.

29:21.933 --> 29:22.695
Come on.

29:22.767 --> 29:25.292
- Are you angry, too?
- No, man.

29:25.370 --> 29:29.067
I want to be your friend.
Listen, you can open any car you want?

29:29.240 --> 29:30.264
Sure.

29:30.408 --> 29:32.706
You want to help us out?

29:33.411 --> 29:36.380
We got this big job, you know,
where we go around looking...

29:36.447 --> 29:39.507
for old car stereos that need to be,
like, polished up...

29:39.584 --> 29:42.382
and repaired and stuff,
and that's what we do.

29:42.520 --> 29:45.819
And then we put them back in the cars
and everybody is happy.

29:45.957 --> 29:50.587
We work for the
Department of Car Stereo Repair, right?

29:51.029 --> 29:53.327
And we're really overworked.

29:53.398 --> 29:56.629
We got too many cars to do today.
See all those cars?

29:57.635 --> 30:01.366
We have to do all those cars
or we don't even get to go home...

30:01.739 --> 30:05.004
to see our families
and little babies and stuff.

30:08.880 --> 30:11.508
- Is it doing it?
- I don't see nothing.

30:11.583 --> 30:13.448
I think it split, man.

30:16.855 --> 30:19.915
I got radios! I got stereos!
I got tape decks and CDs!

30:19.991 --> 30:22.482
Everything you need
for car systems at low prices!

30:22.560 --> 30:24.858
"I can't help it. Look at me.
I'm in a panic.

30:24.929 --> 30:26.829
"I'm frantic and I'm...

30:26.998 --> 30:28.829
"manic!"

30:30.368 --> 30:32.199
Arriba!

30:47.118 --> 30:50.986
Arriba! Andale! Hola, dude.

30:51.222 --> 30:53.690
Check it out, man. Pretty nice, eh?

30:54.626 --> 30:57.527
Por favor, need assistance
to find Benjamin and Frederick.

30:57.595 --> 31:00.962
135 West Lafayette Boulevard.
Usted comprende amigo?

31:01.065 --> 31:04.432
That's right across the street.

31:04.936 --> 31:06.426
Muchas gracias.

31:06.671 --> 31:09.936
What is this, some type of stunt? A joke?

31:10.074 --> 31:11.666
No humor is involved.

31:11.843 --> 31:14.437
Collecting mucho input. Urban input.

31:14.512 --> 31:16.139
Be careful!

31:16.281 --> 31:19.682
Be careful. You really should
cross at the crosswalk.

31:19.984 --> 31:22.009
- You lost Number Johnny Five?
- Hold it.

31:22.086 --> 31:24.452
You stop backing up,
you untrustworthy person.

31:24.522 --> 31:25.522
Now, get up!

31:25.590 --> 31:28.058
I did not lose him, first of all.
He just ran out.

31:28.126 --> 31:28.956
He went ape.

31:29.027 --> 31:31.359
My friends trusted me
and I lowered them down.

31:31.429 --> 31:33.192
- Your friends?
- This is a major screw-up!

31:33.264 --> 31:36.700
Your friends? What about me?
What about this business?

31:36.834 --> 31:38.028
Excuse me. I...

31:38.102 --> 31:41.037
I found this machine across the street.

31:41.506 --> 31:42.837
Number Johnny Five!

31:42.941 --> 31:45.569
Am I not telling you not to go
outside of the doors?

31:45.643 --> 31:49.977
Outside of doors is city. Awesome input.
You did not tell me.

31:50.181 --> 31:53.048
You have been vandalized all over yourself.

31:53.117 --> 31:56.177
No, decorations.
Multicolored petroleum by-products.

31:56.321 --> 31:59.552
Los Locos kick your ass!
Los Locos kick your face!

31:59.724 --> 32:03.091
Los Locos kick your balls
into outer space!

32:03.161 --> 32:04.628
Number Johnny Five!

32:04.829 --> 32:06.456
Come on. I will clean you up.

32:06.597 --> 32:08.963
If you had a mouth,
I'd wash it out with soap.

32:09.033 --> 32:10.033
But, I....

32:10.068 --> 32:12.502
You really saved our bacon there.
Thanks a lot.

32:12.570 --> 32:15.368
That thing is remarkable! Is it yours?

32:15.440 --> 32:18.568
Yes, there's only one of them
and we've got it.

32:18.643 --> 32:21.669
We're using it to build
this fine line of quality toys.

32:21.879 --> 32:24.143
- Hey, that's very nice.
- Isn't that cute?

32:24.215 --> 32:26.342
My name is Oscar Baldwin.

32:26.417 --> 32:27.611
I work at the bank.

32:27.685 --> 32:30.245
I thought this building had been vacated.

32:30.922 --> 32:34.050
Maybe you'd like to join
the Neighborhood Merchants Association.

32:34.125 --> 32:34.750
Well...

32:34.826 --> 32:37.090
I happen to be
the Membership Committee chairman.

32:37.161 --> 32:39.823
We're on a short-term lease.
We'll be gone in a month.

32:39.897 --> 32:42.422
You have removed 57 car stereos?

32:42.967 --> 32:44.229
From automobiles?

32:44.302 --> 32:45.030
What?

32:45.103 --> 32:46.764
You were out ripping stuff off?

32:46.838 --> 32:49.671
Not ripping, unscrewing.
I helped my friends:

32:49.741 --> 32:52.107
The Department of Car Stereo Repair.

32:52.310 --> 32:54.608
Dummy, you were boosting car stereos!

32:54.679 --> 32:56.840
It was stealing, okay? You were stealing!

32:56.914 --> 32:58.848
- You got fingerprints?
- No, he doesn't.

32:58.916 --> 33:01.976
Stealing? To take property
without permission, unlawfully?

33:02.320 --> 33:04.845
But they said it's their job.
They'll put them back!

33:04.922 --> 33:07.720
No, they scammed you, see?
They tricked your ass.

33:07.792 --> 33:10.283
I've got more brains in my nostril
than he's got...

33:10.361 --> 33:11.988
in his whole erector set.

33:12.063 --> 33:15.521
I was tricked? Flimflammed?
Hornswoggled?

33:15.600 --> 33:19.661
You see, this is not the countryside.
This is the city-side.

33:20.038 --> 33:23.269
There are many people here,
and people, they are very complicated.

33:23.341 --> 33:25.707
I know. I've spent
my entire lifetime as one...

33:25.777 --> 33:27.938
and still I do not understand them.

33:28.012 --> 33:30.446
Now, please, will you stay inside?

33:30.948 --> 33:31.948
Okay.

33:31.983 --> 33:33.109
Okay, thank you.

33:40.158 --> 33:43.355
- Let's go, Saunders.
- God, I think I'm allergic to this stuff.

33:43.428 --> 33:44.656
Come on.

33:44.829 --> 33:46.660
The key is in the ignition.

33:47.198 --> 33:49.166
- Get it! The key!
- I got it!

33:50.968 --> 33:54.768
"Dear Stephanie, the toys are almost done.
The city is nice...

33:54.872 --> 33:57.306
"but people here get angry easily.

33:57.375 --> 34:01.368
"Maybe they need more fiber in their diet.
Or maybe it's just me.

34:02.246 --> 34:03.372
"Love, Johnny.

34:03.448 --> 34:06.542
"P.S. Enclosed is
something called a chilidog."

34:10.121 --> 34:11.213
Masks?

34:11.422 --> 34:15.755
Disguises? Excuse me, gentlemen.
Our showroom closes at 6:00.

34:16.960 --> 34:18.929
Let's get that craphead.

34:22.266 --> 34:24.166
Have a seat, gentlemen.

34:24.835 --> 34:28.272
Why are you angry?
Why try to disassemble Johnny Five?

34:29.774 --> 34:31.139
Bad humans!

34:34.145 --> 34:38.138
Please allow me to demonstrate
the law of centrifugal force.

34:38.748 --> 34:41.081
Please return your seatbacks
and tray tables...

34:41.152 --> 34:44.985
to their full, upright positions
in preparation for landing.

34:45.255 --> 34:47.952
"Robot ejects prowlers. Film at 11 p.m."

34:57.835 --> 34:59.564
To the moon, Alice.

35:00.671 --> 35:03.037
Who are these masked men
and what do they want?

35:03.107 --> 35:05.632
Does everybody get treated this way?

35:06.043 --> 35:07.908
Now we have to get a security system.

35:07.979 --> 35:09.970
Security system? Sure.

35:12.250 --> 35:13.717
" R-E-S-P-E-C-T

35:14.085 --> 35:15.643
"That is what I'd like for me

35:15.987 --> 35:18.319
- "R-E-S-P-E-C-T"
- Lower your volume.

35:18.389 --> 35:20.914
I cannot hear myself forgetting
what I am studying.

35:20.992 --> 35:25.053
It makes me unable even to remember
the name of Warren G. Harding.

35:25.696 --> 35:26.924
Harding?

35:28.299 --> 35:29.493
Johnny.

35:29.934 --> 35:31.162
Hi, Oscar.

35:32.470 --> 35:34.665
I thought this would interest you.

35:34.739 --> 35:37.207
- Sightseeing tips!
- Lots of input.

35:37.275 --> 35:38.902
Oscar, thank you.

35:41.913 --> 35:43.813
And I'll read it again later.

35:43.981 --> 35:45.881
- I found one for you.
- Great.

35:46.784 --> 35:48.046
- Got it?
- Yep.

35:50.855 --> 35:51.855
Hello, there.

35:52.256 --> 35:54.884
I just thought I'd drop off
that application for you.

35:54.959 --> 35:56.950
Thanks. I'll get to it right away.

35:57.028 --> 35:58.461
What's he doing, anyway?

35:58.529 --> 36:00.759
Making homemade contraption
to protect my friends.

36:00.831 --> 36:03.129
Let me ask you something.
How does that thing work?

36:03.201 --> 36:04.964
Do you run it by remote control?

36:05.036 --> 36:06.560
No, you just talk to it.

36:06.637 --> 36:08.161
Absolutely amazing.

36:08.272 --> 36:11.435
I know about computers
and we'd expect to pay no less than...

36:11.509 --> 36:13.636
$500,000 for something like him.

36:13.711 --> 36:15.201
Johnny Five total value:

36:15.279 --> 36:19.181
$11,002,076.17.

36:19.884 --> 36:23.786
$11,000,000, you see? And well worth it!

36:24.155 --> 36:28.615
Capable of doing anything,
and a marvellous personality to boot.

36:28.893 --> 36:30.884
Thank you, Oscar. Adios.

36:31.963 --> 36:36.923
I like Oscar. He's friendly.
And he treats me with "R-E-S-P-E-C-T."

36:37.068 --> 36:38.968
"Sock it to me, sock it to me"

36:39.036 --> 36:41.129
Amendment 2, right to have bare arms...

36:41.205 --> 36:43.298
- All right, what's the deal here?
- What?

36:43.374 --> 36:46.400
I'm talking about a robot worth
$11,000,000 bucks?

36:46.644 --> 36:47.338
So?

36:47.411 --> 36:48.708
So, Benny:

36:48.813 --> 36:52.044
Why are we killing ourselves
making toys for a lousy $50,000?

36:52.116 --> 36:55.552
- Why don't we sell the big one?
- What? This is not possible.

36:55.653 --> 36:57.678
For very personal reasons.

36:57.955 --> 37:00.924
Number Johnny Five cannot be sold
in any way howsoever.

37:00.992 --> 37:03.688
Am I making myself completely
transparent to you?

37:03.761 --> 37:05.820
Transparent as hell.

37:05.896 --> 37:10.663
Out of all the partners I could have picked,
I get the one that doesn't wanna be rich.

37:12.803 --> 37:17.069
Of course, if everybody was rich,
then everybody would have a Bisana.

37:17.908 --> 37:20.877
Benny, grab your jacket.
I'm taking you to lunch.

37:21.012 --> 37:23.480
- I've been thinking about Sandy.
- You have?

37:23.547 --> 37:25.640
And how she's got your jeans steaming.

37:25.716 --> 37:27.149
- That's not true.
- Listen.

37:27.218 --> 37:29.550
It's a surprise, the kind
of guys they go for.

37:29.787 --> 37:32.381
You'd think it'd be someone like me, right?
No hope.

37:32.456 --> 37:34.651
It always some guy just like you. I swear.

37:34.725 --> 37:37.193
But she isn't recognizing me
when she is seeing me.

37:37.261 --> 37:38.728
Hey, I'm telling you.

37:38.796 --> 37:41.424
You know what you gotta do?
You gotta break it up...

37:41.499 --> 37:44.059
with a little small talk, you know?
Small talk?

37:44.135 --> 37:46.365
You start out by talking about the weather.

37:46.437 --> 37:49.736
Then you move on to complimenting
her shoes or her earrings.

37:49.840 --> 37:52.707
Then you move onto something
more personal, you know?

37:52.777 --> 37:56.508
Tell her you find yourself
fascinated by her hypnotic blue eyes.

37:56.714 --> 37:58.944
I paid yesterday. Bill
is picking it up today.

37:59.016 --> 38:00.984
- Who?
- Hey, Bill. How you doing?

38:01.052 --> 38:03.043
Good game. Great game.

38:03.120 --> 38:05.145
- Hi, Bill.
- Fine young athlete.

38:05.222 --> 38:06.222
I'm with him.

38:06.290 --> 38:08.383
Hypnotic blue eyes.

38:08.459 --> 38:09.756
That sounds good.

38:09.827 --> 38:11.692
That sounds good. You're on a roll.

38:11.762 --> 38:13.195
- Yes.
- You know what I'd do?

38:13.264 --> 38:14.856
- What?
- I'd go see Sandy today.

38:14.932 --> 38:16.126
- Today?
- Absolutely.

38:16.334 --> 38:19.394
Right after lunch.
I'm not that hungry myself.

38:19.503 --> 38:22.666
I can go take care of the store.
You go for the groceries.

38:22.740 --> 38:25.174
- I'll cover for you. Go for it.
- You think so?

38:25.242 --> 38:26.334
Absolutely.

38:26.410 --> 38:29.140
Thank you, Fred. Sandy Banatoni.

38:29.947 --> 38:33.075
Come on, J. Five. I got some people
that are dying to meet you.

38:33.150 --> 38:36.586
Frederick, I have an important question.
Why do humans not like me?

38:36.654 --> 38:37.780
Call me "craphead"?

38:37.855 --> 38:41.154
They like you. Craphead is a compliment.

38:42.460 --> 38:46.692
Check it out! Major input!

38:46.797 --> 38:49.664
Frederick, wait here.
I'll be right back after these words.

38:49.734 --> 38:51.793
Input, input!

38:51.969 --> 38:52.993
No!

38:56.140 --> 38:57.664
Input!

38:57.775 --> 38:58.867
Watch out!

38:59.744 --> 39:03.111
Input! Treasure Island,
Origin of the Species.

39:03.180 --> 39:06.343
Everything You Always Wanted
to Know About Sex.

39:09.920 --> 39:10.920
Five?

39:15.092 --> 39:16.092
More!

39:18.896 --> 39:20.124
Fabulous!

39:20.197 --> 39:23.530
That was good. I like that one.
That one, too.

39:24.068 --> 39:26.593
Boring. The movie was better.

39:27.171 --> 39:28.866
These two are wonderful.

39:30.241 --> 39:33.108
Five, what are you doing?
You're gonna get us busted here!

39:33.177 --> 39:36.613
Frederick, I must read
these two books very carefully.

39:39.850 --> 39:43.513
Two excellent books.
May I have these, craphead?

39:44.922 --> 39:46.514
Five! Come on, we gotta go.

39:46.590 --> 39:49.525
- But, Fred, l...
- Do you see those two guys down there?

39:49.593 --> 39:51.925
They wanna take your books away.

39:54.765 --> 39:56.096
Nice going, ace.

39:56.333 --> 39:59.791
- Read any good books lately?
- Yes. I covered many great subjects.

39:59.870 --> 40:02.395
Philosophy, art, religion, aerobics.

40:02.506 --> 40:04.497
But, Frederick, there are so many more.

40:04.575 --> 40:06.202
I could be done in 35 minutes.

40:06.277 --> 40:07.744
- Can't we just...
- Give me a break.

40:07.812 --> 40:10.076
- I got you some input, didn't I?
- But, l...

40:10.147 --> 40:11.739
Now you do something for me!

40:11.816 --> 40:13.909
- Okay.
- And watch the shirt.

40:13.984 --> 40:15.474
- Silk.
- Damn right.

40:15.553 --> 40:18.716
From the Bombyx mori moth caterpillar,
or silkworm.

40:18.789 --> 40:21.622
I don't care!
Come on, we're gonna be late.

40:30.868 --> 40:33.428
This is far too risky.
I mean, broad daylight.

40:33.504 --> 40:36.166
All of them are gone.
It's the only chance we'll get.

40:36.240 --> 40:39.038
We'll be out of here in under two minutes.

40:44.949 --> 40:48.646
I used to do this for a living.
It'll be a controlled fire.

41:01.732 --> 41:03.859
Ladies and gentlemen, please...

41:03.934 --> 41:06.061
direct your attention to the persons...

41:06.136 --> 41:08.570
attempting illegal entry here at 135...

41:08.639 --> 41:11.130
West Lafayette Boulevard.
They are criminals...

41:11.208 --> 41:13.108
thugs, bad dudes, desperados.

41:13.210 --> 41:16.475
So get the police, the Lone Ranger,
Dirty Harry, Mean Joe Green...

41:16.547 --> 41:18.947
the Green Berets, the Green Hornet.

41:21.418 --> 41:22.680
No, it can't be.

41:22.753 --> 41:26.154
The Nova project was scrapped
and the robots were destroyed.

41:26.223 --> 41:28.316
I'm telling you, it's a Nova robot.

41:29.093 --> 41:31.027
Follow the red card. Winners all the time.

41:31.095 --> 41:33.256
Everybody is a winner.
Follow the red card.

41:33.330 --> 41:34.228
Red to black.

41:34.298 --> 41:36.493
Follow the red card, not the black card.

41:36.567 --> 41:39.161
Here it is. Step right up.
Take a chance. Place a bet.

41:39.236 --> 41:41.796
It's just that me and Ben Jahrvi,
we've got...

41:41.872 --> 41:42.998
Ben Jahrvi?

41:43.774 --> 41:46.834
Ben Jahrvi, wasn't he with Nova Robotics?

41:46.911 --> 41:48.708
He was Newton Crosby's partner.

41:48.846 --> 41:50.643
Whatever happened to those guys?

41:50.714 --> 41:53.444
They were supposed to be
such hotshot engineers.

41:54.118 --> 41:55.779
Incredible adaptability.

41:55.853 --> 41:58.219
It's a breakthrough in
artificial intelligence.

41:58.289 --> 42:00.484
- Hi.
- Very impressive, Mr....

42:00.558 --> 42:02.617
Ritter, Fred Ritter. Nice to meet you.

42:02.693 --> 42:05.218
Ritter, huh?
You say it's not remote controlled...

42:05.296 --> 42:06.786
but how can you get...

42:06.864 --> 42:08.991
such a range of abilities?

42:09.567 --> 42:12.127
Corporate secrets
which I will explain in detail...

42:12.202 --> 42:15.638
once we have a sale.
That is, if you're interested.

42:15.940 --> 42:18.408
Well, yes, of course, we are interested.

42:18.509 --> 42:21.740
Sale. Contract by which ownership
of property is transferred.

42:21.812 --> 42:23.837
What property is for sale?

42:24.214 --> 42:25.875
Well, you, I hope.

42:25.950 --> 42:28.350
Fred wants to sell me?

42:28.786 --> 42:32.153
- Come on, it's just a figure of speech.
- Am not property, Frederick.

42:32.222 --> 42:35.919
One whose person is under control
of another as master, is a slave.

42:35.993 --> 42:38.484
That's all we need,
a robot who's into equal rights.

42:38.562 --> 42:42.123
Five, if you blow this, I'll pull
your head off. I swear to God I will.

42:42.199 --> 42:45.259
But they cannot purchase me.
Cannot. I am alive!

42:45.402 --> 42:49.099
I am endowed by my creator
with certain inalienable rights!

42:55.145 --> 42:58.512
Falling 32 feet per second. Unacceptable.

42:59.984 --> 43:03.147
Better hurry before I make
a big hit on Broadway.

43:13.130 --> 43:15.360
Steady, watch the trim.

43:19.470 --> 43:21.199
It's great up here.

43:21.639 --> 43:23.664
No problems.

43:25.042 --> 43:26.839
Look up there.

43:26.910 --> 43:30.573
- What is that? Look at that thing!
- Some kind of a bird!

43:30.648 --> 43:32.548
No, it's a hang glider!

43:32.616 --> 43:34.413
I wish I were a bird.

43:34.718 --> 43:37.016
Me, Chrome-Breasted Input Eater.

43:38.555 --> 43:42.150
Dream on, Johnny. Landing area, 6:00.

43:42.926 --> 43:45.019
Beginning final approach.

43:54.471 --> 43:55.961
What's this?

43:58.142 --> 44:01.339
Aesthetic input. Sculpture. Modern art.

44:06.950 --> 44:08.611
An early Brancusi?

44:08.919 --> 44:13.151
Please, darling, it is a Hankoff.
It's gaunt, angular...

44:13.857 --> 44:15.290
repulsive.

44:33.977 --> 44:37.276
What do you think, Mr. Slater?
We can call it Funny Fingers.

44:37.715 --> 44:39.012
Sandy....

44:39.116 --> 44:41.516
Now, you've been with us how long?
Two months?

44:41.585 --> 44:44.486
You still haven't found one item
I'd consider carrying.

44:44.555 --> 44:46.216
The robots, sir. I found those.

44:46.290 --> 44:48.952
Where are they?
You're dealing with a street hustler.

44:49.026 --> 44:51.893
- Come on, Sandy. Get with it!
- He's not street hustler.

44:51.962 --> 44:54.954
He's a robotics engineer.
He worked for the government.

44:55.899 --> 44:58.766
He's very businesslike.
A total professional.

45:00.904 --> 45:02.098
Pardon.

45:03.841 --> 45:05.308
Delivery boy.

45:08.679 --> 45:10.408
- That was my boss.
- Sorry.

45:10.481 --> 45:13.109
Listen, Ben.
What's going on with those robots?

45:13.183 --> 45:15.242
We're getting close to the deadline.

45:15.319 --> 45:17.787
Well, we are manufacturing them
like gangbangers.

45:17.855 --> 45:19.447
Busters. Gangbusters.

45:19.623 --> 45:20.623
Busters.

45:21.158 --> 45:23.490
Okay, good. Totally professional.

45:23.560 --> 45:25.221
I knew I could count on you.

45:25.362 --> 45:27.057
I can count on you, can't I?

45:27.131 --> 45:30.066
Sandy, that pogo stick guy
is waiting for you upstairs.

45:31.902 --> 45:35.736
I gotta run. Contact me
as soon as the complete shipment is ready.

45:35.806 --> 45:38.866
Hold this. Thank you. Sandy?

45:39.743 --> 45:41.005
Excuse me.

45:41.078 --> 45:43.945
It is time to tell you something
which is very important.

45:44.014 --> 45:45.777
I have a need to explain.

45:47.084 --> 45:49.882
Oh, God. There's a problem, isn't there?

45:50.154 --> 45:53.055
You won't be able
to make the robots on time?

45:53.190 --> 45:54.782
I knew it.

45:55.559 --> 45:57.618
Slater tells us, "Don't take chances."

45:57.694 --> 46:00.094
So I don't.
Then I take a chance and then....

46:00.164 --> 46:02.132
- He'll fire me.
- No, everything is okay.

46:02.199 --> 46:04.667
This is not my current discussion of topic.

46:06.236 --> 46:07.635
Ben, then, what is?

46:09.540 --> 46:10.734
Well....

46:11.441 --> 46:14.274
I am wishing to say there is a...

46:14.511 --> 46:17.071
great deal of weather today.

46:19.850 --> 46:23.377
I say, you know,
you have attractive shoes and earrings.

46:24.221 --> 46:25.313
Thank you.

46:25.622 --> 46:28.853
I am fascinated by your hypnotic blue eyes.

46:29.793 --> 46:31.226
I mean, brown.

46:31.295 --> 46:32.592
They're brown.

46:32.896 --> 46:35.956
- Ben...
- It is a small talk, chat-chit to...

46:36.033 --> 46:38.092
to increase the relationship with...

46:38.168 --> 46:41.626
Ben, you don't have to make small talk.

46:41.705 --> 46:44.299
We're already in business.
What you have to make...

46:44.374 --> 46:46.604
are those damn little robots, you know?

46:46.677 --> 46:50.204
And I really got to run,
so why don't you go back to work, okay?

46:50.747 --> 46:53.477
I shall be damn sure
telling you when the robots are...

46:53.550 --> 46:56.075
to be completed. To damn to be sure.

46:56.153 --> 46:58.314
Gaya yaar, sub kharaab, hogaya.

47:07.130 --> 47:09.428
Maybe a new wardrobe would help.

47:09.900 --> 47:11.390
60 regular.

47:14.304 --> 47:17.137
Great fit! Fashion statement.

47:19.409 --> 47:22.435
Mixing in with all the other living bipeds.

47:22.913 --> 47:25.711
I'm just like you
except I'm from out of town.

47:28.852 --> 47:30.319
They're buying it.

47:36.927 --> 47:40.454
Beautiful architecture.
Edifice, Romanesque.

48:05.422 --> 48:08.186
Can someone direct me
to the answers, please?

48:15.299 --> 48:17.790
Maybe that's where the answers are.

48:21.939 --> 48:23.201
Hello?

48:23.640 --> 48:25.073
Yes, my child?

48:25.242 --> 48:27.176
Hello. Need input.

48:27.277 --> 48:29.837
Input? Well, that's what I'm here for, son.

48:29.947 --> 48:33.041
People dislike me.
Call me droid, ugly mother.

48:33.116 --> 48:36.017
My goodness.
Well, I've been called a few names myself.

48:36.086 --> 48:39.317
I understand it. It always hurt.
We all want to be liked.

48:39.389 --> 48:42.324
The truth is,
it doesn't matter what people think of you.

48:42.392 --> 48:43.222
It doesn't?

48:43.293 --> 48:46.194
No. What matters is what you do,
how you live...

48:46.363 --> 48:50.424
what the Lord thinks about you.
We're all equal before Him.

48:50.801 --> 48:53.964
All equal? Oh, but I'm different. I'm a...

48:54.471 --> 48:56.905
No, you're not.
No matter what you've done...

48:56.974 --> 49:01.468
you are as deserving as anyone else.
You possess the immortal soul.

49:01.745 --> 49:03.474
That makes you equal.

49:03.814 --> 49:08.547
Soul? Yes, input from
Bible, Koran, Upanishads.

49:08.785 --> 49:11.913
Well, I lean towards the Bible myself.

49:12.089 --> 49:14.057
I possess immortal soul?

49:14.257 --> 49:17.249
Of course you do, my son.
You're human, right?

49:17.461 --> 49:20.555
No, I'm a machine, but I am alive.

49:22.799 --> 49:26.098
Now, this is confession!
You don't play games in the house of God!

49:26.169 --> 49:28.501
Not games. Have questions.
Need answers.

49:28.572 --> 49:31.302
Then come to confession yourself.
Don't send a machine!

49:31.375 --> 49:33.468
You can't confess by remote control.

49:33.543 --> 49:35.534
Now, out! Get out!

49:43.687 --> 49:45.848
Look at that thing over there.

49:46.223 --> 49:49.090
You think that's the who's-it
that trashed the bookstore?

49:49.159 --> 49:51.559
How many of these could there be?

49:55.866 --> 49:57.766
All right. Fun's over.

49:57.834 --> 50:00.769
Police officer,
can you answer questions for me?

50:00.837 --> 50:01.997
Just the facts.

50:02.072 --> 50:04.233
Whoever's running this, this is the police.

50:04.307 --> 50:06.002
- Come on out now.
- But I am out.

50:06.076 --> 50:07.100
Here I am.

50:07.177 --> 50:10.669
Listen up, now!
We got complaints on this thing.

50:10.781 --> 50:12.749
Complaints? I did something wrong?

50:12.816 --> 50:14.147
All right.

50:15.886 --> 50:17.353
This is your last chance.

50:17.421 --> 50:20.754
Either you come out now
or we're impounding this piece of equip...

50:20.824 --> 50:23.258
But I am not equipment.

50:23.326 --> 50:26.489
Am passerby, man on street, average Joe.

50:26.696 --> 50:28.129
Is this thing for real?

50:28.198 --> 50:31.599
Sure. I'm just on my way
to pick up the kids and my wife.

50:31.668 --> 50:34.068
My wife, Morgan Fairchild.

50:34.171 --> 50:36.298
That's the ticket.

50:37.307 --> 50:38.934
You will book me, Danno?

50:39.009 --> 50:43.571
I will make your day? Do not pass go?
I'm underage, you know.

50:45.215 --> 50:46.978
Okay, hold it there.

50:49.453 --> 50:50.283
Mug shots?

50:50.353 --> 50:53.686
- The chief said to get a photo record.
- What are we supposed to do?

50:53.757 --> 50:56.487
Jail is for human beings.
They may be scum of the earth...

50:56.560 --> 50:58.187
but they're human beings.

50:58.261 --> 51:01.822
But I am alive. Read my lip lights.
"I think, therefore I am."

51:02.332 --> 51:03.993
Take it down to Stolen Goods.

51:04.067 --> 51:06.399
I am not stolen goods.

51:06.503 --> 51:07.265
Out!

51:07.337 --> 51:09.168
Oh, but hath not a robot eyes?

51:09.239 --> 51:12.265
Hath not a robot hands, organs,
dimensions, senses...

51:12.375 --> 51:15.867
affections, passions?
If you prick us, do we not bleed?

51:15.946 --> 51:17.971
Battery fluid, maybe.

51:18.281 --> 51:20.841
Let me get this straight.

51:21.051 --> 51:23.986
You tried to sell Number Johnny Five?

51:24.221 --> 51:27.952
Yes, but it fell through.

51:29.126 --> 51:31.959
So, where is he now?

51:33.530 --> 51:35.691
I lost him.

51:35.999 --> 51:36.999
I see.

51:37.033 --> 51:39.558
So, you lost him? Oh, well.

51:39.636 --> 51:41.729
Saala gandu! Lundia!

51:41.805 --> 51:43.568
Take it easy! I just misplaced him.

51:43.640 --> 51:44.971
Like car keys, sunglasses...

51:45.041 --> 51:47.305
How are you misplacing
a 700-pound car key?

51:47.377 --> 51:49.777
- Don't come any closer.
- You coward!

51:50.113 --> 51:52.240
You snake in the glass!

51:53.884 --> 51:54.976
Damn it!

51:55.152 --> 51:57.746
- Benjamin Jarvee?
- Jahrvi!

51:58.989 --> 52:00.149
Hello.

52:21.378 --> 52:23.107
Stolen goods warehouse?

52:23.180 --> 52:25.978
He is looking to you
like a household appliance?

52:26.316 --> 52:28.045
Number Johnny Five!

52:28.652 --> 52:31.382
Are you operational?
Say something to me.

52:31.755 --> 52:35.088
Hubcaps, corn dog, soul.

52:36.159 --> 52:37.626
What is this?

52:38.161 --> 52:39.628
He is delicate equipment.

52:39.696 --> 52:43.097
A completely unique, self-mobile
microcomputer robotics system.

52:43.166 --> 52:45.396
We thought it was that.

52:48.672 --> 52:51.505
- Okay, Johnny Five, you're free to go.
- Okay.

52:54.010 --> 52:56.535
What are these foolish clothings
you are wearing?

52:56.613 --> 52:59.741
Attempt to look human, fit in, belong.

53:00.383 --> 53:01.850
Unsuccessful.

53:16.967 --> 53:19.458
When people look at you,
they see a machine...

53:19.536 --> 53:21.834
so they are treating you like a machine.

53:21.905 --> 53:25.705
But this causes strange feeling, emotion.
It's not good.

53:25.809 --> 53:27.538
What emotion is this?

53:27.611 --> 53:30.102
Feels like desert, wasteland.

53:30.313 --> 53:32.804
Can you explain
a little more explicitly, please?

53:32.882 --> 53:35.976
Unpleasant, hollow, cold.

53:36.519 --> 53:37.884
Is it loneliness?

53:38.021 --> 53:43.425
Loneliness, solitude. Yes!
I have read about this in many books.

53:43.827 --> 53:47.263
Francis Bacon said,
"A crowd is not company...

53:47.397 --> 53:50.264
"and faces are but a
gallery of pictures."

53:50.333 --> 53:53.393
Well, you are hitting the nail
right between the eyes.

53:53.703 --> 53:55.864
Anyway, you should become accustomed...

53:55.939 --> 53:59.204
to this feeling because this
is the way life is being usually.

53:59.276 --> 54:02.302
Since I am leaving India,
I, too, am having much loneliness...

54:02.379 --> 54:03.607
in this lifetime.

54:03.680 --> 54:06.843
You are having loneliness, too?
But you're human.

54:06.916 --> 54:09.214
Yes. Humans are everywhere, this is true.

54:09.286 --> 54:11.720
But for two of these humans
to get together...

54:11.788 --> 54:14.848
to not to be lonely, it is very well...

54:15.225 --> 54:16.249
Complicated?

54:16.326 --> 54:19.625
Correct. Because out of all these humans,
there is only one...

54:19.696 --> 54:21.960
that I'm wanting
to be the yin for my yang.

54:22.032 --> 54:23.465
Which one human?

54:25.502 --> 54:27.902
Sandy Banatoni, the human.

54:29.572 --> 54:33.133
Every time I am being near her,
the sweat in the palms...

54:33.910 --> 54:36.174
the duckbumps, I am so...

54:36.613 --> 54:38.046
Like a sweaty duck.

54:38.114 --> 54:40.810
No. Afraid.

54:42.319 --> 54:45.914
- Afraid to be rejected.
- Rejection makes you lonely?

54:45.989 --> 54:46.989
Yes.

54:47.957 --> 54:50.653
You see, we have much in common.

54:50.760 --> 54:54.321
You are lonely because
no one is believing you are alive and...

54:54.564 --> 54:59.331
I am lonely because
Sandy Banatoni is not knowing I am alive.

55:00.103 --> 55:02.264
But, Benjamin, I can help you.

55:02.339 --> 55:05.706
No, I am completely un-helpable.
I cannot be a...

55:05.775 --> 55:08.107
a fast-talking, socially-type person.

55:08.178 --> 55:10.703
But in the bookstore,
I scanned many megabytes...

55:10.780 --> 55:14.238
on male-female relationships,
courtship and dating rituals...

55:14.317 --> 55:16.877
romance novels, poetry.

55:16.953 --> 55:19.444
I could give you input.

55:19.756 --> 55:22.554
Number Johnny Five,
you would be doing this for me?

55:22.625 --> 55:24.820
Well, yes. You're my friend.

55:25.362 --> 55:28.889
That's wonderful!
If you're even just helping me to...

55:29.165 --> 55:32.396
speak to Sandy, I am jumping with joy.

55:32.469 --> 55:36.929
- Well, give me five, hombre.
- Yes, and give me the three.

55:39.509 --> 55:42.444
- We catch fish fresh everyday.
- No, those fish are old.

55:42.812 --> 55:46.441
Look, you have
no background in this field at all.

55:46.583 --> 55:49.677
There is no way to get that robot
to do what we want.

55:49.753 --> 55:53.086
Sounds like a good idea to me.
We sure as hell can't get rid of it.

55:53.156 --> 55:55.420
We can't even get into the damn building.

55:55.492 --> 55:57.892
Why shouldn't we get the robot
to help us out?

55:57.961 --> 56:01.727
It's a computer.
It probably has custom operating systems...

56:02.065 --> 56:05.262
Hey, you're the expert.
The jewels go to the museum in two days.

56:05.335 --> 56:08.702
We're flat out of time, buddy.
So what's your brilliant plan?

56:08.905 --> 56:11.305
Exactly. There is no other plan.

56:11.674 --> 56:15.440
This will be our only opportunity.
Now, you two just keep...

56:15.512 --> 56:18.447
that Indian fellow and his partner
out of that building.

56:18.515 --> 56:20.881
Let me deal with the robot.

56:21.084 --> 56:24.076
You have selected
an appropriate location for my date?

56:24.154 --> 56:28.454
Yes, right on Sandy's way home.
Also remembered another great book:

56:28.525 --> 56:31.255
Dating Dos and Don'ts for Modern Teens.

56:35.498 --> 56:37.625
Are you able to hear me?

56:38.301 --> 56:39.996
Are you able to hear me?

56:40.136 --> 56:41.763
10-4, good buddy.

56:42.172 --> 56:44.072
Mane ghabarat thaychhe.

56:46.109 --> 56:48.839
And with a wave of my magic antenna...

56:51.080 --> 56:52.411
presto!

56:53.283 --> 56:54.648
Go. Now!

56:54.818 --> 56:57.446
- Do it!
- Okay. Lord Rama....

57:00.957 --> 57:04.449
Ignition system has fouled up somehow.
Sorry, folks.

57:08.097 --> 57:09.155
Ben?

57:10.867 --> 57:14.496
There's Sandy.
What a coincidence you are here.

57:14.804 --> 57:17.534
This is so weird.
I was just thinking about you...

57:17.607 --> 57:19.040
and now here you are.

57:19.108 --> 57:20.905
" Say there, Sandy...

57:20.977 --> 57:23.844
"isn't that a swell dress you're
wearing tonight?"

57:24.881 --> 57:26.075
Thanks.

57:26.816 --> 57:29.216
"If it is okay with your Mom and Pop...

57:29.586 --> 57:32.817
"would you like to go to a malt shop
for a cheeseburger?"

57:35.358 --> 57:37.690
Sure. Why not?

57:38.862 --> 57:39.988
Malt shop?

57:40.096 --> 57:42.656
Well, Hungarian malts. Very good.

57:42.932 --> 57:44.126
Oh, no.

57:44.367 --> 57:45.834
It's a better view.

57:50.139 --> 57:52.630
Isn't it strange we should be meeting
like this?

57:52.709 --> 57:55.303
Meet, closeness, proximity, yes.

57:56.279 --> 58:00.579
"The goal of two ones who share
proximity on a physical plane...

58:00.683 --> 58:04.414
"is to achieve a double oneness
on the metaphysical plane."

58:04.687 --> 58:08.384
Ben, don't go weird on me.
Just tell me you are making the robots...

58:08.458 --> 58:10.619
and everything is really okay, right?

58:10.693 --> 58:14.720
"Say, doll, this mug's got more moves
than you got curves.

58:15.098 --> 58:17.259
"I cracked that case hours ago."

58:17.467 --> 58:20.903
Does that mean you're done?
On time? Like I wanted?

58:21.004 --> 58:22.198
Yes.

58:22.272 --> 58:23.330
Definitely.

58:23.406 --> 58:24.896
Great!

58:25.542 --> 58:28.943
I'll arrange to have them
picked up tomorrow. This is terrific.

58:29.078 --> 58:30.511
I know they're gonna sell.

58:30.580 --> 58:32.480
I have a good feeling about this.

58:32.549 --> 58:34.346
You know, this is great for me, too.

58:34.417 --> 58:36.647
I mean,
especially at this stage in my career.

58:36.719 --> 58:38.710
Stage. That's a good one.

58:39.188 --> 58:42.817
I am thinking "all the world's a stage."

58:44.694 --> 58:47.458
"All the world's a stage."

58:47.931 --> 58:49.398
Get off!

58:49.465 --> 58:50.989
You know Shakespeare?

58:51.234 --> 58:53.065
"Are you troubled by irregularity?"

58:54.070 --> 58:57.198
- " Just two tablets brings natural...."
- Get off, Sylvester!

58:57.273 --> 58:59.400
Garfield! Do I look like a mouse?

58:59.676 --> 59:02.975
"It takes a tough man
to make a tender chicken."

59:04.714 --> 59:05.874
Ben....

59:06.416 --> 59:09.112
You're not doing any drugs, are you?
I mean...

59:09.185 --> 59:10.516
Oh, no....

59:12.388 --> 59:13.047
Run!

59:13.122 --> 59:15.750
I knew this guy once
who started talking like you...

59:15.825 --> 59:17.690
right before he decided he was God.

59:17.760 --> 59:18.522
God!

59:18.595 --> 59:19.595
God?

59:19.963 --> 59:23.126
- Jehovah, Krishna, Lord of Lords....
- I think he needs coffee.

59:23.199 --> 59:25.394
Garcon. Deux expressos, s'il vous plait.

59:26.636 --> 59:28.228
French now?

59:29.105 --> 59:31.596
Every time I meet you, I think to myself:

59:31.841 --> 59:33.570
Is he naturally this...

59:33.910 --> 59:35.207
eccentric?

59:36.179 --> 59:39.410
- Or is this just an act, or what?
- Move those balloons!

59:40.850 --> 59:42.841
What are you really like?

59:45.388 --> 59:47.413
I see, no answer to that one.

59:48.458 --> 59:50.392
- Why are guys like that?
- Go on!

59:50.460 --> 59:52.928
I've never been able to figure it out.

59:53.730 --> 59:55.925
All the guys I ever met were the same way.

59:58.601 --> 59:59.625
Me?

01:00:01.804 --> 01:00:02.896
Yes, you!

01:00:04.774 --> 01:00:05.774
Okay.

01:00:05.975 --> 01:00:07.135
Andale! Arriba!

01:00:07.210 --> 01:00:09.542
Guys just smile.

01:00:11.781 --> 01:00:14.249
" Tu mama hace el amor con mi perro."

01:00:14.484 --> 01:00:17.112
Wait, I know a little Spanish.

01:00:17.353 --> 01:00:18.718
Oh, no.

01:00:18.788 --> 01:00:20.016
My mother...

01:00:20.857 --> 01:00:21.983
sleeps...

01:00:22.925 --> 01:00:24.620
with your dog?

01:00:25.228 --> 01:00:26.525
Oh, no!

01:00:27.597 --> 01:00:31.761
Well, that's an expression
in my country, where...

01:00:31.834 --> 01:00:34.200
sometimes we are speaking Spanish.

01:00:34.871 --> 01:00:37.863
It does not mean
that your mother is sleeping with my dog.

01:00:37.940 --> 01:00:38.838
Oh, no.

01:00:38.908 --> 01:00:41.274
It means the people
that she's sleeping with...

01:00:41.344 --> 01:00:42.675
they are like dogs.

01:00:42.912 --> 01:00:44.277
I mean that they are....

01:00:44.347 --> 01:00:46.212
No. What a moron.

01:00:46.482 --> 01:00:47.881
I think I'd better go.

01:00:47.950 --> 01:00:50.214
Oh, no. Maaf karna. I am...

01:00:51.120 --> 01:00:52.610
Please, I am sorry.

01:00:52.689 --> 01:00:55.214
I am confessing to you now, Sandy.

01:00:56.225 --> 01:01:00.628
Everything that I have been saying
has been coming to you, not from me...

01:01:00.997 --> 01:01:04.558
but from my friend who has been
controlling remotely the sign.

01:01:12.341 --> 01:01:14.775
You mean,
you've had someone prompting you?

01:01:14.844 --> 01:01:18.439
Yes. Please, I must escape
this embarrassment.

01:01:18.648 --> 01:01:20.445
Don't. No, wait.

01:01:20.683 --> 01:01:22.583
Sit. Please, sit down.

01:01:23.519 --> 01:01:27.478
Do you mean that you're interested
in me personally?

01:01:28.091 --> 01:01:29.091
Yes.

01:01:33.029 --> 01:01:35.122
So, that's what's been going on.

01:01:35.364 --> 01:01:37.457
You've been trying so hard.

01:01:41.037 --> 01:01:42.800
Ben, the expense alone....

01:01:42.872 --> 01:01:47.138
I am wanting so much to be able
to speak to you with my tongue untied.

01:01:48.277 --> 01:01:49.835
It's really sweet.

01:01:52.081 --> 01:01:53.878
You could have just told me.

01:01:57.186 --> 01:02:01.145
So, what do we talk about now?

01:02:01.924 --> 01:02:03.858
Well, do you like music?

01:02:03.993 --> 01:02:06.826
No. Don't tell me, please.

01:02:06.929 --> 01:02:10.626
This one is Bo Diddley!
Performed by Mr. Diddley himself!

01:02:10.700 --> 01:02:11.724
What year?

01:02:11.801 --> 01:02:13.325
- Nineteen...
- fifty...

01:02:13.402 --> 01:02:14.767
fifty-five!

01:02:14.837 --> 01:02:16.304
That's great.

01:02:19.809 --> 01:02:22.505
I think this Mr. Diddley
did more for this country...

01:02:22.578 --> 01:02:25.172
than Warren G. Hardon. Harding.

01:02:27.750 --> 01:02:29.479
It's okay, Ben.

01:02:31.587 --> 01:02:34.249
Oh, my, how time is fun
when you're having flies.

01:02:34.323 --> 01:02:36.086
I know an all-night rock-and-roll place.

01:02:36.159 --> 01:02:37.820
An after-hours club. You up for it?

01:02:37.894 --> 01:02:40.488
Yes, I am in all directions for it.
Most definitely.

01:02:40.663 --> 01:02:41.663
We need a cab.

01:02:41.731 --> 01:02:44.564
No, I will get it. Allow me, sir....
Ma'am. Pardon me.

01:02:44.634 --> 01:02:45.965
Hello, taxi!

01:02:46.035 --> 01:02:48.697
God, you can't even get a cab in this city.

01:02:49.338 --> 01:02:52.603
Au contraire, mi amiga. Did I startle you?

01:02:52.675 --> 01:02:54.609
- What is that?
- What is what?

01:02:54.677 --> 01:02:55.439
That!

01:02:55.511 --> 01:02:58.446
There are 2,312 taxicabs in this city.

01:02:58.514 --> 01:03:02.006
There's one now. Hey, taxi! Cab!

01:03:03.019 --> 01:03:05.487
Oh, yeah? Bull's-eye!

01:03:10.827 --> 01:03:14.092
Ben, what the hell is that?
It looks like a giant one of your toys.

01:03:14.163 --> 01:03:17.064
Oh, but... Yes, it does, doesn't it?

01:03:17.934 --> 01:03:20.960
Will you please tell me what that thing is?

01:03:22.305 --> 01:03:23.932
Thank you for stopping.

01:03:26.409 --> 01:03:27.876
- Please.
- Excuse me.

01:03:30.513 --> 01:03:32.208
Number Johnny Five.

01:03:33.883 --> 01:03:35.544
Thank you, friend.

01:03:38.054 --> 01:03:40.284
- Now, you go back home.
- Okay.

01:03:52.401 --> 01:03:55.268
Okay, all loaded. 1,000 toy robots.

01:03:56.038 --> 01:03:57.699
Is that it, Robby?

01:03:59.175 --> 01:04:01.109
You enjoying Planet Earth?

01:04:01.277 --> 01:04:02.369
What?

01:04:03.880 --> 01:04:05.507
Take me to your leader.

01:04:05.581 --> 01:04:06.980
What's this?

01:04:08.584 --> 01:04:10.677
This is XL-7, over and out.

01:04:18.394 --> 01:04:19.827
Oh, Oscar!

01:04:19.896 --> 01:04:22.091
Hola, dude! What's happening?

01:04:31.007 --> 01:04:34.738
Number Johnny Five, the date was...

01:04:36.879 --> 01:04:38.608
such a success.

01:04:39.982 --> 01:04:41.381
We talked.

01:04:42.585 --> 01:04:43.950
We danced.

01:04:44.353 --> 01:04:46.753
We drank champagne.

01:04:46.923 --> 01:04:47.787
Well...

01:04:47.857 --> 01:04:50.155
she sure came through with the money.

01:04:50.226 --> 01:04:52.786
Benny, our first big score. Look at that.

01:04:52.862 --> 01:04:54.693
Half those zeroes are yours.

01:04:56.632 --> 01:05:00.090
Come on, you gonna hold a grudge
all your life? Be happy!

01:05:00.303 --> 01:05:02.271
We're finally making it!

01:05:02.371 --> 01:05:05.135
No! No way!

01:05:05.207 --> 01:05:07.004
Who are you guys anyway?

01:05:09.278 --> 01:05:11.371
- Five?
- Number Johnny Five?

01:05:11.781 --> 01:05:15.444
Oscar, you're such a friendly guy.
I always enjoy talking to you.

01:05:15.518 --> 01:05:18.316
Well, I've always enjoyed talking to you.

01:05:19.055 --> 01:05:21.023
But you know something, Johnny?

01:05:21.090 --> 01:05:24.457
I'm worried about our friends,
Benjamin and Frederick.

01:05:24.593 --> 01:05:27.221
Frederick is not my friend.

01:05:28.264 --> 01:05:31.165
Well, to be perfectly honest,
I never liked him either.

01:05:31.233 --> 01:05:33.633
- But Benjamin is our friend, right?
- True-blue.

01:05:33.703 --> 01:05:35.967
Now, with all the break-ins,
the vandalism...

01:05:36.038 --> 01:05:38.063
the sudden attacks by those thugs...

01:05:38.140 --> 01:05:40.938
you and I have to make sure
Benjamin is safe.

01:05:41.110 --> 01:05:41.838
Okay.

01:05:41.911 --> 01:05:45.608
Now, across the street out there
is a little secret room...

01:05:45.715 --> 01:05:49.048
that I happen to know about
and it's a perfect hiding place.

01:05:49.118 --> 01:05:51.985
And I thought Benjamin
could use an escape tunnel...

01:05:52.054 --> 01:05:54.852
to that room in case
those villains come back.

01:05:54.924 --> 01:05:57.188
I worked it out in intricate detail.

01:05:57.259 --> 01:05:59.750
It's taken me a long time, let me tell you.

01:05:59.829 --> 01:06:02.889
Borrowing the blueprints,
purchasing equipment.

01:06:03.265 --> 01:06:05.358
Here, let me show you.

01:06:08.237 --> 01:06:09.568
Get in there!

01:06:13.976 --> 01:06:15.238
Oh, dear!

01:06:15.411 --> 01:06:17.902
I get it. Industrial espionage.

01:06:18.247 --> 01:06:20.772
We got a hot toy,
so the big boys want it, right?

01:06:20.850 --> 01:06:23.717
Relax, get comfortable.
You're gonna be here for a while.

01:06:23.786 --> 01:06:25.879
Somebody will let you out
Monday morning.

01:06:26.389 --> 01:06:28.186
You screw around with Johnny Five...

01:06:28.257 --> 01:06:30.885
he's gonna knock you
into the next ZIP code, pal.

01:06:30.960 --> 01:06:33.588
The robot is working for us now, pal.

01:06:33.996 --> 01:06:37.090
When he's finished,
we'll turn him into aluminium siding.

01:06:37.166 --> 01:06:38.428
No, sir, please!

01:06:39.468 --> 01:06:40.833
Now I wonder...

01:06:41.871 --> 01:06:43.634
if you would help me...

01:06:45.174 --> 01:06:47.039
finish my hiding place...

01:06:48.477 --> 01:06:51.173
for our friend Benjamin.

01:06:51.480 --> 01:06:55.211
Certainly, Oscar.
I'd detach my right arm for Benjamin.

01:06:55.284 --> 01:06:58.651
And my left arm. Or both arms. Oh, wait.

01:06:58.988 --> 01:07:02.048
Subterranean excavation
requires many permits.

01:07:02.124 --> 01:07:04.888
Department of Water, telephone company,
city planners...

01:07:04.960 --> 01:07:06.552
I have them, every single one.

01:07:06.629 --> 01:07:07.721
Okay.

01:07:10.332 --> 01:07:11.629
Low bridge.

01:07:12.701 --> 01:07:14.566
This place is a mess.

01:07:26.415 --> 01:07:29.578
I'm sorry I tried to sell
your goddamned robot.

01:07:29.652 --> 01:07:33.019
Okay? It was a dirty trick.
I'm a jerk. I'm a sleazeball.

01:07:33.089 --> 01:07:34.386
You're getting warmer.

01:07:34.457 --> 01:07:37.187
It's just that when you owe
as much money as I do...

01:07:37.259 --> 01:07:38.783
it puts you under pressure.

01:07:38.861 --> 01:07:41.523
And who would be foolish enough
to loan money to you?

01:07:41.597 --> 01:07:43.827
Don't rub it in. I had to go to a shark.

01:07:43.899 --> 01:07:46.390
Now you're expecting me
to believe that you...

01:07:46.469 --> 01:07:48.266
you borrowed money from a fish.

01:07:48.337 --> 01:07:49.736
A loan shark.

01:07:49.839 --> 01:07:51.807
If you don't pay them back right away...

01:07:51.874 --> 01:07:54.843
they start removing
popular parts of your anatomy.

01:07:55.411 --> 01:07:59.108
And this shark money,
it is what you have used to help me?

01:07:59.215 --> 01:08:02.742
I did it to help us.
Give us our big break, you know?

01:08:04.954 --> 01:08:07.821
You are risking
your popular body parts to...

01:08:09.158 --> 01:08:11.183
- to start our business?
- Yes.

01:08:11.427 --> 01:08:14.885
Only, then I got greedy. I mean, come on...

01:08:14.997 --> 01:08:18.455
a robot worth $11,000,000.
I couldn't stand it.

01:08:19.602 --> 01:08:21.399
I should have known it wouldn't work.

01:08:21.470 --> 01:08:23.529
That thing ran me all over
to hell and gone...

01:08:23.606 --> 01:08:25.233
which I deserve, I admit.

01:08:26.442 --> 01:08:27.932
How do you control it, though?

01:08:28.010 --> 01:08:30.410
Really, Benny,
that thing doesn't work so good.

01:08:30.479 --> 01:08:33.380
Well, there is something in which
I have not told you also.

01:08:33.448 --> 01:08:36.179
The reason it is so difficult
to control is because...

01:08:36.252 --> 01:08:39.085
- it is just like you and I.
- What are you talking about?

01:08:39.154 --> 01:08:42.955
I mean, it is making a lot of mistakes
because it is alive.

01:08:44.359 --> 01:08:45.520
Alive?

01:08:45.594 --> 01:08:48.563
I know what it's like for Benjamin
working long hours...

01:08:48.631 --> 01:08:50.826
for very little compensation.

01:08:50.933 --> 01:08:54.663
I work all day with other people's money.
Look, but don't touch.

01:08:54.870 --> 01:08:58.499
Don't make mistakes.
They treat me like a machine.

01:08:59.875 --> 01:09:01.399
Like a machine?

01:09:01.577 --> 01:09:04.876
This gives you bad emotion,
loneliness, unhappiness.

01:09:05.080 --> 01:09:07.674
Oscar, come here.

01:09:09.118 --> 01:09:10.585
I understand.

01:09:12.188 --> 01:09:15.350
So those two dickheads out there,
if they smash Johnny Five up...

01:09:15.424 --> 01:09:17.858
would they shut him down or something?

01:09:17.926 --> 01:09:21.225
- He'll be dead?
- Lf he is losing his power, yes.

01:09:21.529 --> 01:09:23.589
That's it. We gotta get out of here.

01:09:24.500 --> 01:09:27.196
All right, the two of us together.
We can take it.

01:09:27.269 --> 01:09:29.032
One shot. Mind over matter. Ready?

01:09:29.104 --> 01:09:30.036
- Ready.
- On three?

01:09:30.104 --> 01:09:32.403
One, two, three.

01:09:37.513 --> 01:09:41.210
My mind is not getting over that matter.
That is for certain.

01:09:42.518 --> 01:09:44.917
Oh, good golly! I just remembered.

01:09:45.020 --> 01:09:47.511
I'm now missing
my second date with Sandy.

01:09:47.590 --> 01:09:48.886
Oh, no.

01:10:09.311 --> 01:10:11.245
Squid. I need squid.

01:10:12.314 --> 01:10:15.112
Wait a minute, they screwed up!

01:10:15.284 --> 01:10:16.284
- What?
- Look!

01:10:16.352 --> 01:10:18.786
"Doo Wah's Chinese Restaurant and Deli."

01:10:18.854 --> 01:10:22.346
There is the address right there!
We know where we are!

01:10:22.424 --> 01:10:24.119
Oh, such excellent luck.

01:10:24.360 --> 01:10:27.056
But to whom are we to tell
this earth-quaking news?

01:10:27.129 --> 01:10:28.129
Right.

01:10:28.797 --> 01:10:30.856
It doesn't help us save
Number Johnny Five.

01:10:30.933 --> 01:10:33.561
We may be too late already.
We've been here for hours.

01:10:33.636 --> 01:10:36.537
It is unfortunate we're not carrying
a telephone with us.

01:10:36.605 --> 01:10:40.041
- Well, I left mine in the Mercedes.
- No, I am speaking seriously.

01:10:40.109 --> 01:10:43.567
There is a telephone line here.
I can wire in the telephone easily.

01:10:43.646 --> 01:10:45.841
Hey, Benny, can't you use that?

01:10:45.914 --> 01:10:48.075
I mean you're a high-tech kind of a guy.

01:10:48.284 --> 01:10:52.050
Can't you make something?
Send them Morse code or something?

01:11:00.562 --> 01:11:04.498
"Johnny's in the tunnel with Oscar
Digging ten feet below

01:11:04.600 --> 01:11:07.296
"Johnny's in the tunnel with Oscar"

01:11:08.370 --> 01:11:09.860
Juicy Fruit...

01:11:10.639 --> 01:11:12.834
to hold the wire in place.

01:11:22.084 --> 01:11:25.542
9-1-1. Oh, Bagwhan, please.

01:11:26.088 --> 01:11:28.056
Ringing! It is ringing.

01:11:28.490 --> 01:11:29.650
Ringing again.

01:11:29.725 --> 01:11:33.286
And someone has picked up.
Now quickly, tell me the code.

01:11:35.397 --> 01:11:36.489
This Morse code.

01:11:36.565 --> 01:11:38.328
- I don't know it!
- What do you mean?

01:11:38.400 --> 01:11:39.662
I thought you knew that stuff.

01:11:39.735 --> 01:11:40.963
No. This is a fine...

01:11:41.036 --> 01:11:43.903
What kind of a genius
are you if you don't know it?

01:11:43.972 --> 01:11:45.940
How am I supposed to know Morse code?

01:11:46.008 --> 01:11:48.602
- I can't believe you...
- Oh, dear.

01:11:48.677 --> 01:11:49.677
What is that?

01:11:49.745 --> 01:11:53.442
- The Beach Boys, 1964, "Help Me, Rolla."
- Rhonda.

01:11:53.515 --> 01:11:56.712
I'm studying popular music,
so I can increase my relationships...

01:11:56.785 --> 01:12:00.778
and communications with Sandy,
who I'll probably never be seeing again.

01:12:00.856 --> 01:12:04.383
Wait a minute. Fred has this weird idea.

01:12:06.261 --> 01:12:08.559
"I don't know why

01:12:08.630 --> 01:12:11.861
"But I'm feeling so sad

01:12:13.736 --> 01:12:18.002
"I long to try something I've...."

01:12:18.640 --> 01:12:21.404
- Is this gonna work?
- Yes. I think she will understand.

01:12:21.477 --> 01:12:23.945
She's very knowledgeable in this field.

01:12:24.913 --> 01:12:27.040
- Does she have an answering machine?
- Yes.

01:12:27.116 --> 01:12:29.016
Greetings. Hello, I'm Sandy Banatoni.

01:12:29.084 --> 01:12:31.552
I'm not here,
but leave message at sound of tone.

01:12:31.620 --> 01:12:33.485
I'll get back on you when I return.

01:12:33.555 --> 01:12:35.716
But please wait for a beeping beep. Beep.

01:12:35.791 --> 01:12:37.224
- Yes. Right.
- First one.

01:12:37.292 --> 01:12:40.887
"Help me, Rhonda
Help, help me, Rhonda"

01:12:41.029 --> 01:12:44.294
"Oh, where can you be?"

01:12:45.601 --> 01:12:48.866
"7-8-7, 8-8-9-7-4."

01:12:49.304 --> 01:12:52.933
"Camptown robots sing this song
Doo-dah, doo-dah

01:12:53.041 --> 01:12:56.340
"Think this tunnel's five-miles long
Oh, Doo-Dah-Day

01:12:56.578 --> 01:12:59.342
"Gonna dig all night, gonna"...

01:13:00.849 --> 01:13:04.683
Madson steel alloy. A-450.
I'll dig around it.

01:13:04.987 --> 01:13:05.612
No!

01:13:05.687 --> 01:13:07.211
No, it's okay.

01:13:08.791 --> 01:13:12.750
Oh, yes. This is the secret room.

01:13:12.828 --> 01:13:15.524
I had planned to make an entrance
with a cutting torch...

01:13:15.597 --> 01:13:18.293
but perhaps you have a faster way?

01:13:19.535 --> 01:13:21.264
- Entrance. Portal.
- Right.

01:13:21.336 --> 01:13:22.598
- A hole.
- Yes!

01:13:30.813 --> 01:13:32.337
Hey, good morning out there.

01:13:32.414 --> 01:13:34.814
You're tuned to Daddy-O's Patio
with Stacks o' Wax...

01:13:34.883 --> 01:13:36.817
and golden-oldie, platter-chatter, too.

01:13:36.885 --> 01:13:40.048
And we've got lots more on tap.
Little Anthony and the Im...

01:13:44.626 --> 01:13:46.025
What the hell?

01:13:53.335 --> 01:13:55.064
Wait a minute. Ben?

01:14:02.945 --> 01:14:06.278
Stand back, please.
My plasma cutter is dangerous to humans.

01:14:19.294 --> 01:14:21.319
Yes, turn here. I think.

01:14:21.630 --> 01:14:25.964
"They say the neon lights are bright
On Broadway"

01:14:26.034 --> 01:14:28.229
Broadway. It's gotta be it. Keep going.

01:14:28.303 --> 01:14:31.363
Excuse me, but if you are worried
for your friend to be safe...

01:14:31.440 --> 01:14:32.634
why not call the police?

01:14:32.708 --> 01:14:33.868
I called them.

01:14:33.942 --> 01:14:35.534
They said technically, he's missing.

01:14:35.611 --> 01:14:37.078
If he's just missing...

01:14:37.145 --> 01:14:40.046
he must be missing 24 hours
before he's officially missing.

01:14:40.115 --> 01:14:41.605
But something's wrong.

01:14:41.683 --> 01:14:42.479
I just know it.

01:14:42.551 --> 01:14:45.520
We are at Broadway.
Is it a left or right that I would hang?

01:14:45.587 --> 01:14:46.679
Wait.

01:14:51.727 --> 01:14:54.787
"You can always go Downtown"

01:14:54.863 --> 01:14:56.626
Downtown! Take a left!

01:14:56.732 --> 01:14:59.633
Hurry up, please!
We may not have much time.

01:15:00.168 --> 01:15:01.999
Okay, Ben.

01:15:02.070 --> 01:15:03.799
Broadway's a long street.

01:15:05.741 --> 01:15:08.107
"Sixteen Candles"

01:15:08.176 --> 01:15:09.643
Tony Romeo and the Crests.

01:15:09.711 --> 01:15:10.973
Sixteenth Street!

01:15:11.046 --> 01:15:14.504
That's it. Sixteenth Street! Go! Hurry!

01:15:14.783 --> 01:15:17.843
Can't you go any faster?
If you get a ticket, I'll pay for it.

01:15:17.920 --> 01:15:21.356
- Move, lady!
- Okay, rockin' baby. Sixteenth Street.

01:15:21.423 --> 01:15:22.481
Next song, please.

01:15:22.558 --> 01:15:23.957
Where did you learn this stuff?

01:15:24.026 --> 01:15:27.655
Leningrad. Black market.
Everything from Abba to ZZ Top.

01:15:31.066 --> 01:15:32.533
What is this?

01:15:32.634 --> 01:15:33.999
You have not known this one?

01:15:34.069 --> 01:15:35.798
Otis Redding. Dock of the Bay.

01:15:35.871 --> 01:15:37.304
Dock of the Bay!

01:15:37.372 --> 01:15:40.239
Of course! Dock of the Bay!
Good! Go towards the docks!

01:15:40.309 --> 01:15:41.309
Okey-dokey.

01:15:51.019 --> 01:15:53.419
"Lucy, I'm home!"

01:15:53.722 --> 01:15:55.087
Oh, my God!

01:15:59.628 --> 01:16:01.357
You're incredible!

01:16:02.097 --> 01:16:04.463
This is the room,
the hiding place for Benjamin.

01:16:04.533 --> 01:16:05.966
Isn't it wonderful?

01:16:06.301 --> 01:16:10.499
Oscar? Hiding place is bank vault.
Heimdall bank vault.

01:16:11.106 --> 01:16:13.597
Well, yes, of course.

01:16:14.176 --> 01:16:16.144
That's the whole idea, see?

01:16:16.278 --> 01:16:18.769
What could be safer than a safe?

01:16:19.014 --> 01:16:21.608
- But isn't that...
- We need to do just one more thing.

01:16:21.683 --> 01:16:24.208
We need to clear out all my old junk here.

01:16:25.120 --> 01:16:26.348
Open this box.

01:16:26.421 --> 01:16:30.983
But Oscar, cutting hole in bank vault
is not damage? Vandalism?

01:16:31.393 --> 01:16:34.294
Don't be ridiculous. I own this vault.

01:16:34.529 --> 01:16:37.089
You can't vandalize something
if it's already yours.

01:16:37.165 --> 01:16:38.564
Come on!

01:16:38.634 --> 01:16:40.226
Well, all right.

01:16:48.443 --> 01:16:49.637
Hold this.

01:17:01.089 --> 01:17:03.023
- Now open this.
- Okay.

01:17:13.802 --> 01:17:15.133
Precious stones.

01:17:15.337 --> 01:17:18.636
Diamonds. The Vanderveer Collection.

01:17:20.008 --> 01:17:21.873
This is your old junk?

01:17:22.744 --> 01:17:23.802
Yep.

01:17:24.079 --> 01:17:25.410
Excuse me.

01:17:26.548 --> 01:17:28.846
- Oscar owns the Vanderveer Collection?
- Yes!

01:17:28.917 --> 01:17:30.350
What? Oscar!

01:17:30.552 --> 01:17:31.450
Louie, Louie!

01:17:31.520 --> 01:17:35.581
Nah, no, it's doo-doo something.
"Da-Doo-Run-Run"

01:17:36.458 --> 01:17:39.359
Doo Wah Diddy! Yes!

01:17:41.363 --> 01:17:43.422
What the hell's a "Doo Wah Diddy"?

01:17:56.445 --> 01:17:58.572
"The warmth in your heart...

01:17:59.214 --> 01:18:02.479
"makes others happy."

01:18:03.018 --> 01:18:04.713
I still like this one.

01:18:04.853 --> 01:18:06.548
"Opportunity is waiting.

01:18:06.722 --> 01:18:09.088
"You need but to open the door."

01:18:11.059 --> 01:18:12.617
Arm yourself.

01:18:17.699 --> 01:18:18.563
Hi.

01:18:18.633 --> 01:18:22.228
It's coming and it's smarter
than I thought. Get ready!

01:18:22.304 --> 01:18:24.534
I'm telling you,
we should take the robot, too!

01:18:24.606 --> 01:18:25.903
Don't be absurd!

01:18:25.974 --> 01:18:28.738
But Oscar, taking jewels
without permission is stealing!

01:18:28.810 --> 01:18:30.778
Boosting. Ripping off...

01:18:36.918 --> 01:18:39.944
- You missed him!
- It's half busted. We'll finish it off.

01:18:40.021 --> 01:18:42.546
You idiots! You don't even know
what you're chasing.

01:18:42.624 --> 01:18:45.422
- Artificial intelligence automat...
- Will you shut up!

01:19:08.483 --> 01:19:10.212
Help! Police!

01:19:11.219 --> 01:19:14.711
Must find policeman!
Constable! Gendarme!

01:19:17.159 --> 01:19:19.184
Hurry up! We've gotta get him.

01:19:20.195 --> 01:19:22.823
Police station! Which way?

01:19:27.302 --> 01:19:30.135
- Look out!
- Stand back!

01:19:40.982 --> 01:19:42.210
Where is he?

01:19:50.058 --> 01:19:52.288
You have some explaining to do,
young man.

01:19:52.360 --> 01:19:54.385
- Do something!
- Oscar, enlighten me.

01:19:54.462 --> 01:19:56.987
Why try to disassemble Johnny Five?

01:19:57.265 --> 01:20:01.395
- "Act-ay ared-scay."
- Is your speech program scrambled?

01:20:01.503 --> 01:20:03.266
- What?
- "Act-ay ared-scay."

01:20:03.338 --> 01:20:06.068
"Et-gay ehind-bay im-hay!"

01:20:06.274 --> 01:20:08.265
"Et-gay ehind-bay im-hay!"

01:20:08.410 --> 01:20:11.902
Oh, right. I'm scared. We'd better go.

01:20:12.047 --> 01:20:14.106
Oh, shit. I'm scared.

01:20:14.182 --> 01:20:15.979
Let's get out of here.

01:20:16.084 --> 01:20:20.487
Oscar, I do not understand this input.
What language are you speaking, Oscar?

01:20:30.532 --> 01:20:32.625
Hey, no! No, wait!

01:20:36.137 --> 01:20:37.661
Wreck it!

01:20:38.206 --> 01:20:41.004
Don't you get it?
It's a witness that can identify us!

01:20:41.076 --> 01:20:42.737
No! Stop! Please!

01:20:42.911 --> 01:20:44.538
Not just machine!

01:20:44.913 --> 01:20:47.643
Not disassemble! Am alive! Can die!

01:20:47.716 --> 01:20:49.411
Smash the damn thing!

01:20:49.484 --> 01:20:52.214
No! Please! I'm alive!

01:20:53.088 --> 01:20:54.715
No, stop!

01:20:55.023 --> 01:20:56.752
No, do not kill me!

01:21:00.161 --> 01:21:02.561
- No!
- It's still moving! Get it!

01:21:02.631 --> 01:21:05.099
Hit it!

01:21:05.166 --> 01:21:06.166
No!

01:21:07.836 --> 01:21:08.836
Rip it apart!

01:21:10.438 --> 01:21:12.633
Hit it! Finish it off!

01:21:17.479 --> 01:21:20.277
What the hell? Come back here!

01:21:30.191 --> 01:21:31.715
Hey, come back here!

01:21:39.768 --> 01:21:41.668
That's it! Good!

01:21:47.342 --> 01:21:48.468
Look out!

01:21:56.084 --> 01:21:58.382
Hey, those things can kill you!

01:22:03.892 --> 01:22:04.950
Get up!

01:22:37.692 --> 01:22:39.284
Come on.

01:22:39.794 --> 01:22:42.729
Number Johnny Five! Johnny?

01:22:43.531 --> 01:22:45.829
Fred, check outside.

01:22:47.235 --> 01:22:48.634
Where is he?

01:22:48.937 --> 01:22:51.872
A secret, sliding descending staircase.

01:22:52.807 --> 01:22:53.933
Johnny Five?

01:22:54.209 --> 01:22:56.609
- Number Johnny Five?
- Freeze! Hands in the air!

01:22:56.678 --> 01:22:59.476
- Hands over your head!
- What is the meaning of....

01:22:59.547 --> 01:23:00.809
I said, don't move!

01:23:00.882 --> 01:23:03.282
Stand apart, now! Do it now. I said, now!

01:24:24.532 --> 01:24:26.056
Have you seen a robot?

01:24:26.134 --> 01:24:29.069
About this big.
Looks like a metal grasshopper.

01:24:29.337 --> 01:24:31.464
No grasshoppers today?

01:25:46.948 --> 01:25:48.643
J. Five!

01:25:48.983 --> 01:25:50.314
Hey! Stop!

01:25:58.393 --> 01:26:01.453
Oh, God! What did they do to you?

01:26:34.729 --> 01:26:36.856
I can't.

01:26:37.131 --> 01:26:38.996
The cops have got him.

01:26:53.248 --> 01:26:55.648
Me? Fix?

01:26:57.552 --> 01:26:59.383
How? With what?

01:27:17.939 --> 01:27:19.065
The purple?

01:27:19.140 --> 01:27:21.631
The purple wires?
Twist them back together?

01:27:23.244 --> 01:27:26.145
"Lo-hel," bozo. Hello, "zo-bo."

01:27:27.215 --> 01:27:28.682
Hello, bozo.

01:27:29.784 --> 01:27:31.308
Thank God, are you okay now?

01:27:31.386 --> 01:27:34.253
No, backup power "ing-go." Going.

01:27:34.922 --> 01:27:36.856
Can't you just plug it into the wall?

01:27:36.924 --> 01:27:40.416
Main "wer-po," power circuits are severed.

01:27:40.528 --> 01:27:43.725
Must "nnect-reco," reconnect main battery.

01:27:43.798 --> 01:27:46.767
"Pen-o," open. Quick, like a bunny.

01:27:48.202 --> 01:27:51.899
- Oh God! You're bleeding!
- Yes, battery fluid.

01:27:53.741 --> 01:27:57.370
Oh, no, Fred.
Not your "shilk sirt." Silk shirt.

01:27:57.779 --> 01:28:00.043
- Bombyx mori moth caterpillar.
- Forget it.

01:28:00.114 --> 01:28:02.412
I think I got you bandaged.
You gonna be okay now?

01:28:02.483 --> 01:28:03.108
No.

01:28:03.184 --> 01:28:06.620
Must repair wiring to memory.
My memory is me.

01:28:06.954 --> 01:28:11.323
If it loses power, I die, expire,
"buck the kicket."

01:28:13.895 --> 01:28:16.295
Just tell me what to do.

01:28:16.731 --> 01:28:19.461
First get soldering iron, iron, iron....

01:28:21.069 --> 01:28:22.696
- Thank you.
- This is it, right?

01:28:22.770 --> 01:28:24.635
- No.
- No, that's not it.

01:28:31.145 --> 01:28:34.273
I can't do this. I'm no good at this stuff.

01:28:34.349 --> 01:28:37.477
15 minutes you have to get good.

01:28:38.419 --> 01:28:39.078
What?

01:28:39.153 --> 01:28:41.986
Plenty of time.

01:28:42.056 --> 01:28:44.923
Time, in a sort of runic rhyme...

01:28:45.026 --> 01:28:47.494
All right, don't lose it.

01:28:47.562 --> 01:28:50.258
Just tell me, step by step.

01:28:51.632 --> 01:28:54.260
We were nowhere near that tunnel.

01:28:54.335 --> 01:28:56.735
I was spending the night with a friend...

01:28:56.804 --> 01:28:59.329
- in a Chinese refrigerator.
- It's true! Smell him!

01:29:06.147 --> 01:29:07.910
Hurry, Fred!

01:29:23.297 --> 01:29:25.231
Backup power is going.

01:29:29.604 --> 01:29:31.196
Hurry! Quickly!

01:29:32.073 --> 01:29:32.971
Jesus!

01:29:33.040 --> 01:29:36.407
Christ. Lived from 1 to 33 AD.

01:29:36.511 --> 01:29:37.910
Okay, those are in now.

01:29:37.979 --> 01:29:39.742
This should be it. Right?

01:29:39.814 --> 01:29:41.042
Hope so.

01:29:41.449 --> 01:29:43.542
Okay. Here we go!

01:29:43.618 --> 01:29:46.246
Hello, baby!

01:29:47.155 --> 01:29:49.089
Told you you could do it.

01:29:49.290 --> 01:29:50.484
Thanks.

01:29:51.392 --> 01:29:55.055
Okay, ace? If I get your arm working,
you can do the rest yourself, right?

01:29:55.129 --> 01:29:56.460
"Kay-o, Derf."

01:29:56.764 --> 01:29:57.856
Fred.

01:29:58.032 --> 01:29:59.932
That's what I said. "Derf."

01:30:11.679 --> 01:30:13.146
Why'd you get dinosaurs?

01:30:13.214 --> 01:30:16.206
They were on sale at Woolworth's.
Oscar said it didn't matter.

01:30:16.284 --> 01:30:17.615
It doesn't matter.

01:30:17.752 --> 01:30:19.879
This'll get us through customs just fine.

01:30:19.954 --> 01:30:22.889
Our gift to the Brazilian
National Orphanage.

01:30:23.424 --> 01:30:25.449
Oscar? That shlup?

01:30:26.093 --> 01:30:27.287
I can't believe it.

01:30:27.795 --> 01:30:29.422
How you doing? Feeling better?

01:30:29.497 --> 01:30:32.955
Approximately 70 present,
president, percent repaired.

01:30:33.534 --> 01:30:37.129
Derf, why did Racso lie to me?
Try to disassemble me?

01:30:37.505 --> 01:30:39.803
Rasc.... Oh, Oscar!

01:30:39.907 --> 01:30:43.775
Well, the jewels, man.
They must be worth, well, who knows?

01:30:44.011 --> 01:30:48.846
37,862,000 "lar-dols."
I thought my friend he was.

01:30:49.317 --> 01:30:51.751
Am naive, gullible, schlemiel.

01:30:52.220 --> 01:30:55.155
Lesson Number One:
You can't trust anybody.

01:30:55.389 --> 01:30:57.482
I trust you, now.

01:30:57.725 --> 01:31:00.387
Well, you shouldn't. I wouldn't trust me.

01:31:00.461 --> 01:31:02.395
I tried to cash in on you, too.

01:31:02.463 --> 01:31:04.556
Humans are so "pli-comp-cated."

01:31:05.032 --> 01:31:06.260
Well, come on, buddy.

01:31:06.334 --> 01:31:09.792
Don't take it so hard.
Welcome to life in the big city.

01:31:10.605 --> 01:31:13.438
Oscar suckered me
and I'm the big con man.

01:31:13.508 --> 01:31:17.205
He locked up me and Benny
in a room full of frozen Chinese squids.

01:31:17.278 --> 01:31:21.442
He locked you up? He did not smash,
crush, dent, mangle you?

01:31:22.550 --> 01:31:24.575
No. He just wanted us out of the way.

01:31:24.652 --> 01:31:27.120
Sure. Kidnap the humans...

01:31:27.355 --> 01:31:29.823
destroy the machine!

01:31:45.907 --> 01:31:47.340
All right!

01:31:48.276 --> 01:31:49.675
Let's party!

01:31:51.846 --> 01:31:53.780
Hey, take it easy. You're okay now.

01:31:53.848 --> 01:31:57.284
Am not human, but am a life form.
Have soul.

01:31:57.351 --> 01:31:58.909
But he me killed to try.

01:31:58.986 --> 01:32:00.954
Wait a minute. What are you gonna do?

01:32:01.022 --> 01:32:03.286
Pursue, capture, incarcerate!

01:32:03.357 --> 01:32:05.848
Come on, now, man.
These are serious guys.

01:32:05.927 --> 01:32:09.226
You're not in top form
and your backup battery's used up.

01:32:09.297 --> 01:32:12.596
I'm okay.
Just a few Bugs Bunny to work out.

01:32:12.667 --> 01:32:15.932
In-out, in.... Perfectly functionality.

01:32:16.070 --> 01:32:19.301
Sure, listen to yourself!
You can't even talk straight!

01:32:19.373 --> 01:32:21.398
A life form's gotta do...

01:32:21.475 --> 01:32:24.569
what a life form's gotta do.
Stand aside.

01:32:31.786 --> 01:32:33.481
Hey! How did you get in?

01:32:33.554 --> 01:32:35.044
Hey, life form! Cool it!

01:32:35.122 --> 01:32:37.852
What is that? How much you want for it?

01:32:38.225 --> 01:32:41.160
This is a hell of a way to treat
a future American citizen.

01:32:41.228 --> 01:32:41.956
You know that?

01:32:42.029 --> 01:32:43.121
Please, someone let...

01:32:43.197 --> 01:32:44.528
Excuse me. Listen to me.

01:32:44.599 --> 01:32:47.159
- A life is hanging on a tightrope.
- Just got a 10-31.

01:32:47.234 --> 01:32:50.294
- Guy was ripped off by a robot.
- This is America?

01:32:50.371 --> 01:32:51.371
You!

01:32:51.405 --> 01:32:52.565
This is ridiculous!

01:32:52.640 --> 01:32:53.106
Hello.

01:32:53.341 --> 01:32:56.469
They broke my alarm,
but I didn't hear noise, and then they...

01:32:56.577 --> 01:32:59.273
Excuse me. You are Maniac Mike
who spotted the robot?

01:32:59.347 --> 01:33:00.439
Come with me. Pardon me.

01:33:00.514 --> 01:33:02.243
- I gotta do this.
- This is important.

01:33:02.316 --> 01:33:05.012
- Would you do that for me?
- Come on in the car.

01:33:06.253 --> 01:33:08.881
- Back to the scene of the crime.
- Hey! This is crazy.

01:33:08.956 --> 01:33:11.424
You're never gonna find 'em.
They're long gone.

01:33:11.492 --> 01:33:15.451
Find them, I will.
Activating spectro-analyzer.

01:33:17.098 --> 01:33:21.592
Vehicle tire tracks.
Goodyear radials, 215-75-15.

01:33:21.736 --> 01:33:22.736
Hop on, Derf.

01:33:22.803 --> 01:33:25.863
You mean, you can see their tire tracks?
You can follow them?

01:33:25.940 --> 01:33:30.343
Piece of corn. Can of cake. "Suck doup."

01:33:38.719 --> 01:33:40.778
Oh, no. Fluid.

01:33:41.555 --> 01:33:42.579
He is leaking.

01:33:42.657 --> 01:33:45.285
Hydraulic fluid? Brake fluid?
Lighter fluid?

01:33:45.359 --> 01:33:47.691
Mr. Manic,
you are not knowing your fluids.

01:33:47.762 --> 01:33:50.822
This is battery fluid.
He is bleeding to death.

01:33:54.902 --> 01:33:55.664
Here.

01:33:55.736 --> 01:33:56.532
Parked.

01:33:56.604 --> 01:33:57.604
Gone.

01:33:58.039 --> 01:33:59.563
That way.

01:34:10.885 --> 01:34:13.854
Don't worry.
My cousin was a Harley-Davidson.

01:34:15.389 --> 01:34:17.823
There! Chrysler LeBaron, late model.

01:34:18.025 --> 01:34:20.391
That's them? You did it. We got 'em!

01:34:20.828 --> 01:34:23.695
Headed south on Central Avenue,
a man riding a motorcycle...

01:34:23.764 --> 01:34:26.858
that looks like a robot?
6-Charlie, do you copy?

01:34:26.934 --> 01:34:29.129
That is him! That is Number Johnny Five!

01:34:29.203 --> 01:34:32.036
This is Charlie-6. 6-Charlie, we're on it.

01:34:35.643 --> 01:34:37.270
I don't believe it.

01:34:39.447 --> 01:34:41.677
No! We gotta lose that thing!

01:34:45.352 --> 01:34:46.216
You jerk!

01:34:46.287 --> 01:34:49.256
- We're never gonna catch 'em now.
- Check this out, baby.

01:34:49.323 --> 01:34:50.323
What?

01:34:51.759 --> 01:34:54.250
- No, that's not a good idea.
- Trust me.

01:34:54.328 --> 01:34:58.788
Short cut. As the crow flies.
Have seen utility maps in the bookstore.

01:34:58.999 --> 01:35:01.524
We're on 59th, headed east.
No sign of the suspect...

01:35:01.602 --> 01:35:03.797
We are not seeing the hide
nor the head of them!

01:35:03.871 --> 01:35:06.305
- I am requesting a helicopter immediately!
- Ben?

01:35:06.373 --> 01:35:07.397
4-10!

01:35:08.175 --> 01:35:10.473
Do you know what I'm standing in?

01:35:10.544 --> 01:35:13.012
Suspect vehicle turning east on Lakeshore.

01:35:13.114 --> 01:35:14.114
Wait!

01:35:18.552 --> 01:35:20.816
- What the hell?
- Go around them!

01:35:23.691 --> 01:35:24.691
Look out!

01:35:27.862 --> 01:35:29.659
It's all right. We lost them now.

01:35:29.730 --> 01:35:31.857
I'm telling you, you underestimate him.

01:35:31.932 --> 01:35:33.126
He's gonna find us.

01:35:35.069 --> 01:35:36.502
Do you see them?

01:35:36.604 --> 01:35:37.696
Quiet.

01:35:37.772 --> 01:35:40.798
Quiet? Do you know
what just floated past me?

01:35:40.975 --> 01:35:42.875
Vehicle is low on fuel.

01:35:43.277 --> 01:35:45.040
What? No, it isn't.

01:35:45.112 --> 01:35:46.340
Door is open.

01:35:46.413 --> 01:35:48.813
And you're going nowhere, bozos!

01:35:52.286 --> 01:35:54.652
- What's going on?
- What are you doing now?

01:35:54.922 --> 01:35:56.150
Pumping iron.

01:35:56.290 --> 01:35:57.689
Is the car moving?

01:36:02.263 --> 01:36:05.061
Prepare for launch. All systems are go.

01:36:05.332 --> 01:36:06.332
It's not that.

01:36:06.400 --> 01:36:07.526
The valves?

01:36:09.203 --> 01:36:10.602
We have lift-off.

01:36:21.148 --> 01:36:22.080
What happened?

01:36:22.149 --> 01:36:23.776
Let's get them out.

01:36:24.552 --> 01:36:26.986
Easy. Wait a minute. Are you okay?

01:36:28.289 --> 01:36:29.984
Hey, you.

01:36:30.157 --> 01:36:32.387
Here's Johnny!

01:36:32.626 --> 01:36:34.253
Here. Give me that.

01:36:34.895 --> 01:36:37.830
Okay, jerk off. You're gonna get recycled.

01:36:38.199 --> 01:36:41.657
Oh, yeah? Well, recycle this,
you meshuggenah schmuck!

01:36:41.869 --> 01:36:44.030
Get out of my face, you ugly mother!

01:36:44.104 --> 01:36:46.538
Tu mama hace el amor con mi perro.

01:36:46.874 --> 01:36:49.172
Come on, you bug-eyed geek!

01:36:49.310 --> 01:36:51.073
Do you feel lucky, punk?

01:36:51.245 --> 01:36:53.213
6-Charlie, this sounds like your baby.

01:36:53.280 --> 01:36:56.215
We have a 10-34
between two men and a forklift?

01:36:56.283 --> 01:36:59.446
What is a 10-34?
Why does he not speak English?

01:37:04.992 --> 01:37:06.687
Where you going, Speedy?

01:37:08.395 --> 01:37:10.886
Watch it, dink! You're out of your league.

01:37:11.265 --> 01:37:14.564
Dr. Ruth says, "Violence
is an expression...

01:37:14.735 --> 01:37:16.635
"of sexual frustration."

01:37:16.804 --> 01:37:21.400
Saunders, you bastard, help me!
"Eep-kay im-hay usy-bay!"

01:37:21.475 --> 01:37:22.475
Hey, you!

01:37:22.543 --> 01:37:24.135
You got water-cooled tubes?

01:37:24.211 --> 01:37:26.179
- What?
- I got an error message for you!

01:37:26.247 --> 01:37:27.680
I'll scramble your RAM!

01:37:27.748 --> 01:37:30.774
Oh, like, I'm really scared.
You know, for sure.

01:37:34.655 --> 01:37:37.249
Yes, J. Five!

01:37:38.926 --> 01:37:40.188
You rang?

01:37:42.897 --> 01:37:45.365
"Ew-scray ou-yay, ozo-bay."

01:37:51.705 --> 01:37:53.297
Well, okay, pilgrim...

01:37:53.374 --> 01:37:55.171
it's roundup time.

01:37:59.780 --> 01:38:01.407
Five?

01:38:01.482 --> 01:38:03.609
Excuse me.
Could you put your arms down?

01:38:03.684 --> 01:38:04.378
Sure.

01:38:04.451 --> 01:38:06.419
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

01:38:12.493 --> 01:38:13.892
Five!

01:38:14.895 --> 01:38:16.055
Oscar!

01:38:24.738 --> 01:38:26.638
It's a dead end, Oscar.

01:38:27.908 --> 01:38:29.273
Give it up!

01:38:39.520 --> 01:38:41.988
- Stop!
- So long, sucker.

01:38:49.096 --> 01:38:51.326
Oh, yeah? Watch this.

01:38:52.633 --> 01:38:54.931
Rats. Can't lock on frequency.

01:38:55.669 --> 01:38:58.604
Okay, Oscar. I'll pass you off at the head.

01:38:59.506 --> 01:39:01.030
Hey, tough guy...

01:39:05.279 --> 01:39:06.279
Ben!

01:39:06.814 --> 01:39:07.814
Ben!

01:39:09.717 --> 01:39:12.948
Where is he? He is leaking!
He'll run out of power and he'll die!

01:40:02.169 --> 01:40:04.364
No, Oscar!

01:40:12.012 --> 01:40:14.105
Forget it. You can't swim!

01:40:39.506 --> 01:40:43.067
Elevation! Altitude! Come on!

01:40:47.014 --> 01:40:49.881
Oscar, you will not get away.

01:40:50.150 --> 01:40:52.584
I am really pissed off!

01:41:12.206 --> 01:41:13.206
No!

01:41:13.974 --> 01:41:15.134
No!

01:41:16.477 --> 01:41:19.412
Me, Johnny. You, busted.

01:41:23.550 --> 01:41:25.313
Oh, no!

01:41:38.665 --> 01:41:41.828
What are you? Punishment from God?

01:41:52.946 --> 01:41:56.712
- J. Five!
- Number Johnny Five, are you okay?

01:42:00.053 --> 01:42:02.715
Get out of my way!

01:42:02.789 --> 01:42:04.848
- Please, officer.
- Benjamin.

01:42:05.425 --> 01:42:06.790
Number Johnny Five?

01:42:07.394 --> 01:42:09.658
What is wrong?
Where is your auxiliary power?

01:42:09.730 --> 01:42:11.288
- What?
- His auxiliary power!

01:42:11.365 --> 01:42:12.593
- Backup battery?
- Yes!

01:42:12.666 --> 01:42:15.829
- It's dead!
- He used it up already! Goddamn it!

01:42:15.903 --> 01:42:17.734
I knew he wasn't up to this.

01:42:23.477 --> 01:42:25.206
Number Johnny Five.

01:42:29.316 --> 01:42:30.078
You!

01:42:30.150 --> 01:42:33.085
Medical person, pay attention to your job!
Come here!

01:42:33.153 --> 01:42:33.881
Quickly!

01:42:34.087 --> 01:42:36.681
- Give me the defibrillator!
- Ben, what are you doing?

01:42:36.757 --> 01:42:38.019
Give it to me!

01:42:38.592 --> 01:42:39.923
Good-bye...

01:42:41.295 --> 01:42:42.956
Benjamin.

01:42:46.800 --> 01:42:47.800
No!

01:42:49.336 --> 01:42:51.167
Listen, you nutcase! Give me that!

01:42:51.238 --> 01:42:52.762
Do not be touching me, sir.

01:42:52.839 --> 01:42:55.569
Turn the power on
to its top-most capacity.

01:42:55.676 --> 01:42:58.110
- Get back!
- Look out!

01:43:00.948 --> 01:43:03.644
Number Johnny Five.
Come on, Johnny Five.

01:43:05.686 --> 01:43:08.382
Come on, Johnny Five!

01:43:08.455 --> 01:43:09.547
Come on!

01:43:15.395 --> 01:43:16.419
Please!

01:43:16.496 --> 01:43:17.724
Come on!

01:43:42.089 --> 01:43:43.852
Please say something.

01:43:48.228 --> 01:43:50.719
Benjamin.

01:43:52.132 --> 01:43:53.531
My friend.

01:43:54.568 --> 01:43:55.933
Oh, my God.

01:43:56.570 --> 01:44:00.267
Number Johnny Five.
Are you completely operational?

01:44:00.674 --> 01:44:02.403
100 percent intact?

01:44:02.643 --> 01:44:04.907
Perfectly, "kay-o."

01:44:06.880 --> 01:44:10.145
Keep that power on or I'll beat
the living headlights out of you!

01:44:10.217 --> 01:44:12.549
But I've got such a headache.

01:44:13.654 --> 01:44:16.452
Number Johnny Five,
you had me so worried.

01:44:16.556 --> 01:44:17.556
Pardon me.

01:44:38.078 --> 01:44:41.343
See this guy? I know him.
I know him. Fast reader.

01:44:41.415 --> 01:44:44.316
Close personal friend of mine.
Comes by here all the time.

01:44:44.384 --> 01:44:46.978
You talk about speed-reading,
he can really read.

01:44:48.388 --> 01:44:51.118
You want my toys?
Everybody wants my toys.

01:44:51.191 --> 01:44:53.182
Fred, will you hurry up? We'll be late.

01:44:53.260 --> 01:44:55.125
You want 5,000, you got 5,000.

01:44:55.195 --> 01:44:57.493
You just gotta wait six months
like everybody else.

01:44:57.564 --> 01:45:00.499
I got three shifts working on them now.
Not a lot I can do.

01:45:00.567 --> 01:45:02.728
Okay, I'll get back to you.

01:45:03.603 --> 01:45:07.300
I've been a salesman all my life.
I finally got something that sells!

01:45:07.374 --> 01:45:08.966
What about this new slogan:

01:45:09.042 --> 01:45:12.034
"Johnny Five. You know the name,
now own the toy."

01:45:12.112 --> 01:45:15.240
- What do you think?
- I think we ought to get in the car.

01:45:17.584 --> 01:45:19.211
I solemnly swear...

01:45:19.353 --> 01:45:20.945
I solemnly swear...

01:45:21.021 --> 01:45:24.479
that I will support and defend
the Constitution and the laws...

01:45:24.558 --> 01:45:28.085
that I will support and defend
the Constitution and the laws...

01:45:28.161 --> 01:45:30.186
of the United States of America...

01:45:30.263 --> 01:45:32.390
of the United States of America...

01:45:32.466 --> 01:45:33.660
against all....

01:45:33.734 --> 01:45:34.962
- Hurry up!
- Coming.

01:45:35.369 --> 01:45:38.463
Against all enemies,
foreign and domestic...

01:45:38.538 --> 01:45:41.735
and that I will bear true faith
and allegiance to the same...

01:45:41.808 --> 01:45:44.800
and that I will bear true faith
and allegiance to the same...

01:45:44.878 --> 01:45:47.210
and that I take this
obligation freely...

01:45:47.280 --> 01:45:50.181
and that I take this
obligation freely...

01:45:50.250 --> 01:45:53.617
without any mental reservation,
or purpose of evasion...

01:45:53.954 --> 01:45:57.651
without any mental reservation,
or purpose of evasion...

01:46:00.527 --> 01:46:02.427
so help me God.

01:46:02.529 --> 01:46:04.190
So help me God.

01:46:04.398 --> 01:46:06.628
Congratulations to you all.

01:46:06.700 --> 01:46:10.363
And finally,
it is my unique honor officially...

01:46:10.470 --> 01:46:13.303
to recognize our first robotic citizen.

01:46:13.840 --> 01:46:17.037
By this ceremony,
the United States government decrees...

01:46:17.144 --> 01:46:19.806
that he shall have the same rights
and privileges...

01:46:19.880 --> 01:46:22.075
as any other citizen in this nation.
