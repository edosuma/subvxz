WEBVTT

00:00.001 --> 00:01.400
What's up, party people?

00:01.401 --> 00:02.758
Everybody that knows me

00:02.759 --> 00:05.047
knows I'm a sucker for tradition.

00:05.048 --> 00:07.649
For example, every Super Bowl Sunday,

00:07.650 --> 00:13.689
I host my very own halftime
wing-eating contest.

00:13.690 --> 00:16.258
It's not a contest if
you're the only one eating.

00:16.259 --> 00:19.161
Shut up and watch the game.

00:19.162 --> 00:21.095
And every February 14th,

00:21.096 --> 00:23.397
I like to sit and watch "The Notebook"

00:23.399 --> 00:24.866
with my valentine.

00:24.867 --> 00:28.236
Why would her mom hide the letters?

00:32.207 --> 00:33.674
And every year on her birthday,

00:33.675 --> 00:35.910
I call my mama and I tell her I love her.

00:35.911 --> 00:37.545
Happy birthday, Mom.

00:37.546 --> 00:39.280
I love you.

00:39.281 --> 00:42.183
Mom, you've got to stop
poking me on Facebook.

00:42.184 --> 00:44.185
Girl, I'm going to unfollow you.

00:44.186 --> 00:46.154
I'm not being disrespectful.

00:46.155 --> 00:47.655
Yes, ma'am.

00:47.656 --> 00:49.223
Why do I do this?

00:49.224 --> 00:51.192
Because I love traditions.

01:04.873 --> 01:08.276
There go my best friend.

01:08.277 --> 01:10.845
There she is, all single and beautiful.

01:10.846 --> 01:11.946
Come here, girl.

01:11.947 --> 01:13.781
Bring it in, baby.

01:13.782 --> 01:14.949
Come on.

01:14.950 --> 01:16.884
Yvette, I'm fine.

01:16.885 --> 01:19.253
Oh, you don't got to be brave.

01:19.254 --> 01:21.556
It's your first anniversary
since the divorce.

01:21.557 --> 01:22.723
You want to talk about it?

01:22.724 --> 01:24.225
Maybe open a bottle of wine?

01:24.226 --> 01:25.593
No, I don't need any wine.

01:25.594 --> 01:27.462
I just want to, you know, finish doing...

01:27.463 --> 01:30.264
How the hell do you do that so fast?

01:30.265 --> 01:31.732
I know my way around a cork, baby.

01:31.733 --> 01:33.301
Mm-hmm.

01:33.302 --> 01:34.769
Well, Yvette, I appreciate your concern,

01:34.770 --> 01:36.604
but today is just another day.

01:36.605 --> 01:38.639
I'm not going to be sad, I'm
not going to think about it,

01:38.640 --> 01:40.274
and I'm not going to make any plans.

01:40.275 --> 01:43.711
Yvette, get out. We got plans.

01:43.712 --> 01:45.480
Hey, babies.

01:45.481 --> 01:46.914
How you doing?

01:46.915 --> 01:48.516
Marlon, what plans do we have?

01:48.517 --> 01:50.651
Come on, do I need to
refresh your memory?

01:50.652 --> 01:54.622
Hater bridesmaids.

01:54.623 --> 01:56.724
Drunken pastor,

01:56.725 --> 01:58.392
and your uncle splitting his pants

01:58.393 --> 02:00.795
getting low doing the Tootsie Roll.

02:00.796 --> 02:03.431
Yes, Marlon, it's our
wedding anniversary.

02:03.432 --> 02:04.999
Yeah, see. Come on.

02:05.000 --> 02:06.601
I mean, we don't have
to do the same traditions

02:06.602 --> 02:08.269
that we used to do when we were married.

02:08.270 --> 02:10.770
Like, you know, my sexy underwear dance,

02:10.771 --> 02:14.809
which leads to my sexy
no underwear dance,

02:14.810 --> 02:18.012
which leads to your
sexy no underwear dance,

02:18.013 --> 02:19.881
and then we'd have a
butt-naked dance off.

02:19.882 --> 02:22.416
That was weird. Why did we do that?

02:25.621 --> 02:29.490
But you got to admit, my
windmills was real dope.

02:32.194 --> 02:33.895
Come on, I know we can't do that,

02:33.896 --> 02:35.997
but I did make dinner
reservations at Miccello's.

02:35.998 --> 02:37.431
Uh, excuse me.

02:37.432 --> 02:39.634
Can I address the elephant in the room?

02:39.635 --> 02:41.335
Oh, snap. When did your mama get here?

02:41.336 --> 02:43.804
Hey, Ms. Brown.

02:43.805 --> 02:45.740
You're divorced, weirdo.

02:45.741 --> 02:47.975
What kind of deranged stalker Muppet

02:47.976 --> 02:50.578
takes his ex-wife out to
celebrate their anniversary?

02:50.579 --> 02:51.879
It's creepy.

02:51.880 --> 02:53.714
Muppet?

02:53.715 --> 02:56.484
I know your "Fraggle Rock"
looking ass ain't talking.

03:00.389 --> 03:02.523
Let me ask you, what are
you and your ex-husband

03:02.524 --> 03:03.991
doing for y'all anniversary?

03:03.992 --> 03:05.927
Nothing. Why?

03:05.928 --> 03:10.631
Because you got to have a man
in order to lose a man, right?

03:10.632 --> 03:13.034
Okay, Marlon. She's right.

03:13.035 --> 03:15.369
Oh, come on, Ash.

03:15.370 --> 03:17.104
Come on, this is our tradition.

03:17.105 --> 03:19.073
We recreate our first date.

03:19.074 --> 03:21.475
You know, dinner at Miccello's,

03:21.476 --> 03:23.578
walking along the Santa Monica pier,

03:23.579 --> 03:27.014
trying to cop my first
feel on the Ferris wheel.

03:27.015 --> 03:29.083
Marley, you're in charge.

03:29.084 --> 03:30.952
I'm in charge? Zack, go to bed.

03:30.953 --> 03:32.687
Why does she get to be in charge?

03:32.688 --> 03:34.455
Boy, you heard your
sister. Get your ass to bed.

03:34.456 --> 03:35.523
Zack!

03:35.524 --> 03:37.992
Zack, I'm in charge, okay?

03:37.993 --> 03:39.527
And Marlon, divorced people

03:39.528 --> 03:41.062
don't celebrate their anniversary.

03:41.063 --> 03:43.698
It's like a dead person
celebrating their birthday.

03:43.699 --> 03:45.399
Oh, that's a good idea.

03:45.400 --> 03:47.068
Dead guy birthday.

03:47.069 --> 03:48.369
Put that in my will.

03:48.370 --> 03:49.770
But don't put me in a coffin.

03:49.771 --> 03:53.007
Just lean me on a wall
real cool like this.

03:56.875 --> 03:58.177
Damn it.

03:58.285 --> 03:59.419
Just my luck.

03:59.420 --> 04:01.988
I don't have jury duty tomorrow.

04:01.989 --> 04:04.057
- You like jury duty?
- You kidding?

04:04.058 --> 04:06.459
15 bucks a day, free coffee,
and a real-life whodunit?

04:06.460 --> 04:08.962
Whoo, sign me up.

04:08.963 --> 04:10.597
What are you talking about?

04:10.598 --> 04:13.700
Listen, Stevie, black
people don't do that, okay?

04:13.701 --> 04:17.702
We don't do swimming
pools past the stairs.

04:17.704 --> 04:21.373
We don't do ice hockey, or
any hockey for that matter.

04:21.374 --> 04:23.542
And we damn sure don't do jury duty,

04:23.543 --> 04:25.687
because we're scared they're
going to put our black ass

04:25.688 --> 04:26.578
on the stand and say,

04:26.579 --> 04:31.149
"Hey, this is about
you. You under arrest."

04:31.150 --> 04:34.086
I was going to brush up on
my juror's manual tonight,

04:34.087 --> 04:36.755
but since I'm free, I guess
I'll just join you guys

04:36.756 --> 04:38.590
for your anniversary shindig.

04:38.591 --> 04:41.526
Oh, my God, there's not
going to be a shindig.

04:41.527 --> 04:44.196
- Marlon's being crazy.
- I'm being crazy?

04:44.230 --> 04:46.298
You're being crazy if you're
trying to kill this tradition.

04:46.299 --> 04:49.801
Ash, we've been recreating
our first date for 16 years.

04:49.802 --> 04:52.304
Marlon, since you're so into traditions,

04:52.305 --> 04:54.539
now that we're divorced,
how about we start a new one?

04:54.540 --> 04:57.309
One where we're honest
about that first date.

04:57.310 --> 04:58.744
Fine, I'll be honest.

04:58.745 --> 05:01.613
It was fly, you was all
up on a brother, boom.

05:01.614 --> 05:04.116
I put a ring on it.

05:04.117 --> 05:05.584
Marlon, it was a mess.

05:05.585 --> 05:07.719
It was a template for
our entire marriage.

05:07.720 --> 05:10.155
Ah, two sides of a story.

05:10.156 --> 05:12.424
If only there was a time-tested method

05:12.425 --> 05:14.292
of arbitrating such a dispute.

05:14.294 --> 05:17.362
Talking about a jury, y'all.

05:17.363 --> 05:19.431
Yes, a jury.

05:19.432 --> 05:21.166
You guys will hear the testimony,

05:21.167 --> 05:23.702
and then we'll decide,
was our first date,

05:23.703 --> 05:26.605
indeed, the bomb, which it was.

05:26.606 --> 05:28.874
Kids, get on over here.

05:28.875 --> 05:32.077
You are about to experience
the unbridled intoxication

05:32.078 --> 05:34.513
of the judicial process.

05:34.514 --> 05:37.649
That sounds corny as hell.

05:37.650 --> 05:39.618
Marlon, you sure you want to do this?

05:39.619 --> 05:41.553
Yeah, I'm sure I want to do this.

05:41.554 --> 05:43.889
If I win, we're going to dinner.

05:43.890 --> 05:46.391
- Mm-hmm.
- And if you win...

05:46.392 --> 05:49.194
well, pfft, you ain't going to win.

05:49.195 --> 05:51.129
Fine, but the facts.

05:51.130 --> 05:53.331
Not the way you've been
spinning it all these years.

05:53.333 --> 05:55.333
We are going to tell
them the real version

05:55.335 --> 05:56.902
of what happened on that first date.

05:56.903 --> 05:58.637
Oh, come on, Ash.

05:58.638 --> 06:00.172
They don't need to hear
all that nasty stuff.

06:00.173 --> 06:02.307
They're still babies.

06:02.308 --> 06:05.277
Remember, we must all be
impartial and objective.

06:05.278 --> 06:06.511
Even you, Yvette.

06:06.512 --> 06:08.680
I can be objective,

06:08.681 --> 06:13.185
even though I'm sure the
dummy did something dumb.

06:13.186 --> 06:15.187
You shut up with that tacky peach dress,

06:15.188 --> 06:18.056
looking like a damn
well-dressed Snicker.

06:18.057 --> 06:20.859
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,

06:20.860 --> 06:23.161
court is now in session.

06:23.162 --> 06:24.663
Let me set the scene for you.

06:24.664 --> 06:26.732
It was 1997.

06:26.733 --> 06:28.867
"Titanic" was in the movie theaters,

06:28.868 --> 06:31.837
and Leonardo DiCaprio just got his,

06:31.838 --> 06:36.241
oh, white boy-can-get-it
card from the sisters.

06:36.242 --> 06:37.943
So I rolled in to Miccello's

06:37.944 --> 06:40.812
in my mustard-colored Oak
Tree suit, looking fly.

06:42.000 --> 06:48.074

06:54.394 --> 06:56.528
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

07:04.470 --> 07:06.938
You know, when I first saw these roses,

07:06.939 --> 07:09.841
I said to myself, "These are beautiful."

07:09.842 --> 07:11.743
But then myself said,

07:11.744 --> 07:16.214
"These roses are garbage
compared to that girl's beauty."

07:16.215 --> 07:19.885
But then self said,
"Marlon, buy them anyway,

07:19.886 --> 07:22.621
for she knows not her own beauty."

07:22.622 --> 07:27.592
And I said, "Damn, self.
You've been reading."

07:31.898 --> 07:34.766
You had me at "self."

07:37.437 --> 07:40.672
Let's go knock some boots.

07:40.673 --> 07:42.574
Stop. Pause.

07:42.575 --> 07:43.809
Timeout.

07:43.810 --> 07:46.411
Roses and smooth talk?

07:46.412 --> 07:47.913
I'm still listening.

07:47.914 --> 07:51.283
You sound like a real player, Dad.

07:51.284 --> 07:54.252
Don't form an opinion until
both sides make their case,

07:54.253 --> 07:58.423
but legally speaking,
that was stone-cold player.

07:58.424 --> 08:01.293
Here's how the date actually began.

08:01.294 --> 08:03.962
He was a hot mess.

08:10.503 --> 08:12.604
You good?

08:12.605 --> 08:16.274
Don't worry, you ain't got
that long to live anyway.

08:16.275 --> 08:19.411
Hey, how you doing, shorty doo-wop?

08:19.412 --> 08:21.313
I'm sorry I'm looking all busted,

08:21.314 --> 08:24.349
but my A/C in my car's broken

08:24.350 --> 08:27.819
and my windows don't roll down.

08:27.820 --> 08:29.621
You're 40 minutes late.

08:29.622 --> 08:32.624
I figured I'd give you time to miss me.

08:34.760 --> 08:36.394
Oh, here.

08:36.395 --> 08:39.030
I bought you something.

08:39.030 --> 08:40.966
I was going to get you roses,

08:40.967 --> 08:44.269
but my hookup on the freeway
off-ramp, he was fresh out.

08:44.270 --> 08:46.771
And I was like, "Damn, Paco."

08:46.772 --> 08:52.410
So it was either oranges
or candles de Jesus.

08:52.411 --> 08:57.949
And it's hard to get busy
with, you know, Jesus like this.

08:57.950 --> 09:00.318
Kind of creepy, you know.

09:00.319 --> 09:02.487
Damn, I'm sweaty.

09:02.488 --> 09:04.089
Oh, yeah, that's right.

09:04.090 --> 09:06.057
I did bring oranges.

09:06.058 --> 09:08.760
Freeway oranges? Really, Dad?

09:08.761 --> 09:10.695
The jury should consider
that they do help

09:10.696 --> 09:12.063
in the fight against scurvy.

09:12.064 --> 09:13.698
- Ah.
- See?

09:13.699 --> 09:16.735
They jury is rocking
with me on the oranges.

09:16.736 --> 09:18.670
I think you need to get
your face ready for dinner.

09:18.671 --> 09:20.372
They're not going to be rocking with you

09:20.373 --> 09:22.941
on this next part,
because even you can't spin

09:22.942 --> 09:25.510
- what happened next.
- It was awesome.

09:25.511 --> 09:29.080
If they believe your version,
or maybe they want the truth.

09:29.081 --> 09:33.118
You can't handle the truth!

09:33.119 --> 09:34.953
You're out of order, you're out of order!

09:34.954 --> 09:37.656
This whole courtroom is out of order!

09:37.657 --> 09:42.861
Love should have brought
your ass home last night.

09:42.862 --> 09:48.566
Until you do right by me,
everything you do will crumble!

09:48.568 --> 09:52.704
Now, I think a couple of those
were not courtroom dramas,

09:52.705 --> 09:55.074
but either way it goes, I rest my case.

09:56.714 --> 09:58.915
Marlon, please inform the
jury of what happened next.

09:58.916 --> 10:00.726
Well, after we enjoyed

10:00.727 --> 10:02.828
a nice, delightful meal of baked ziti,

10:02.829 --> 10:07.767
Ashley went to the
bathroom to "freshen up."

10:07.768 --> 10:09.034
And when she came out...

10:09.035 --> 10:10.836
? Rhymes all the time ?

10:10.837 --> 10:12.170
? That's what I do,
I'm bustin' rhymes ?

10:12.171 --> 10:13.838
? I be like, rawr, rawr! I be crazy ?

10:13.839 --> 10:16.007
? Oh wow, wow ?

10:16.008 --> 10:20.845
Damn, I ain't know you
could freestyle, too.

10:20.846 --> 10:23.848
That's just something I be
doing off the top of the dome,

10:23.849 --> 10:25.817
you know what I'm saying?

10:25.818 --> 10:29.654
But, damn, Ma, I think you
all that and a bag of chips.

10:29.655 --> 10:32.857
You know what, I kind of
want to be outtie 5000.

10:32.858 --> 10:34.859
So I was thinking, you know,

10:34.860 --> 10:37.695
now that I've filled your belly
with zesty, cheesy goodness...

10:37.696 --> 10:39.364
Word.

10:39.365 --> 10:42.033
I was thinking maybe we could
take a walk down the pier,

10:42.034 --> 10:44.903
and perhaps I could, if you allow me to,

10:44.904 --> 10:48.106
if I'm not being too
forward, Ma, no disrespect...

10:51.110 --> 10:55.947
that I could hold your hand
while we look up at the moon,

10:55.948 --> 10:59.884
'cause you my type of hyper.

10:59.885 --> 11:02.320
Lead the way, my Mandingo king.

11:02.321 --> 11:04.055
'Cause all niggity-niggity-night,

11:04.056 --> 11:07.192
I've been thinking about
climbing up and down that lanky,

11:07.193 --> 11:09.160
chocolate frame and making shameful,

11:09.161 --> 11:12.197
disgusting love on the
top of the Ferris wheel.

11:12.198 --> 11:13.765
No diggity.

11:13.766 --> 11:15.199
No doubt.

11:15.201 --> 11:17.268
Damn, girl.

11:17.269 --> 11:20.338
You a freak.

11:20.339 --> 11:23.174
But I like that.

11:27.079 --> 11:29.247
- Ew, stop!
- Gross!

11:29.248 --> 11:32.951
Gross is y'all breath
in the morning, okay?

11:32.952 --> 11:34.519
That was pure sexy.

11:34.520 --> 11:37.088
Girl, I got to say, a nice dinner

11:37.089 --> 11:38.756
and a stroll down the pier?

11:38.757 --> 11:40.892
Sounds pretty legit to me.

11:40.893 --> 11:44.796
And if it sounds legit,

11:44.797 --> 11:47.565
you must acquit!

11:47.566 --> 11:49.934
Objection, Johnny.

11:49.935 --> 11:52.770
What happens next is the moment

11:52.771 --> 11:56.274
that Marlon always seems to skip over.

11:56.275 --> 11:58.977
Hey there, squally-dip.

11:58.978 --> 12:00.478
It's almost 8:00.

12:00.479 --> 12:02.380
Uh, shouldn't we head to the concert?

12:02.381 --> 12:04.549
I don't want to miss a
minute of Boyz II Men.

12:04.550 --> 12:07.552
This fool took you to go see Boyz II Men?

12:07.553 --> 12:09.320
How come I never knew this?

12:09.321 --> 12:12.991
Because this fool never
took me to see Boyz II Men.

12:15.427 --> 12:18.229
Okay. Hold up, hold up, hold up.

12:18.230 --> 12:19.931
I tried to get those tickets.

12:19.932 --> 12:23.601
He a liar, and the truth ain't in him!

12:23.602 --> 12:25.970
Order in the court!

12:25.971 --> 12:28.206
The jury foreman has a question.

12:28.207 --> 12:31.943
If the date was so bad, then
why was there a second one?

12:31.944 --> 12:34.412
Yes, Ashley.

12:34.413 --> 12:38.349
Do tell the jury what happened next.

12:38.350 --> 12:42.086
And I remind you, you are under oath.

12:44.924 --> 12:47.492
So you lied to me to get
me to go out with you?

12:47.493 --> 12:49.327
Oh, no, I didn't lie.

12:49.328 --> 12:50.828
Bye.

12:50.829 --> 12:52.363
Wait, no, no. Listen, I didn't lie.

12:52.364 --> 12:54.999
I didn't, okay, not about the tickets.

12:55.000 --> 12:56.467
I lied about the bulge, okay?

12:56.468 --> 12:58.636
This is fake. This is fake, okay?

12:58.637 --> 13:03.174
But, other than that, I
didn't lie about the tickets.

13:03.175 --> 13:05.176
If you'll just let me explain, okay?

13:05.177 --> 13:08.980
When I first asked you out,
I didn't have the tickets,

13:08.981 --> 13:11.616
but I was going to get them
from a very reliable source.

13:11.617 --> 13:14.018
He told me to come and bring $200,

13:14.019 --> 13:17.388
but when I met him, he said
the tickets was $200 each.

13:17.389 --> 13:20.158
And so, I started haggling with
him, and so he struck me a deal.

13:20.159 --> 13:24.996
He didn't give me the tickets,
but I got this Rolex for $82.

13:24.997 --> 13:27.131
Wait, hold up.

13:27.132 --> 13:28.566
That say Polex.

13:28.567 --> 13:30.902
Why didn't you just tell me?

13:30.903 --> 13:32.870
Well, I didn't think
you was in to watches.

13:32.871 --> 13:34.405
I would've hooked you up, too.

13:34.406 --> 13:37.175
About the tickets.

13:37.176 --> 13:39.977
I didn't want you to think I was broke.

13:39.979 --> 13:42.113
So you'd rather I think you're a liar?

13:44.416 --> 13:46.150
Hey, hey, hey.

13:46.151 --> 13:50.521
Listen, I think you're
unlike any girl I ever met,

13:50.522 --> 13:53.491
and I just wanted to make a
really good first impression,

13:53.492 --> 13:55.560
and I know I messed that up,

13:55.561 --> 13:58.062
but we could still have a
really good time tonight.

13:58.063 --> 14:00.364
You like Boyz II Men?
I'll do you one better.

14:00.366 --> 14:04.535
We'll do a solo act... Boy II Man.

14:04.536 --> 14:06.371
Yeah, okay. We'll
figure out a name later.

14:06.372 --> 14:08.106
- Here.
- Wait...

14:08.107 --> 14:09.507
You're going to get front row seats

14:09.508 --> 14:11.943
to the best show in town.

14:11.944 --> 14:14.078
What are you doing? Are you crazy?

14:14.079 --> 14:16.414
? When I can't sleep at night ?

14:16.415 --> 14:19.183
? Without holding you tight ?

14:19.184 --> 14:20.985
? Girl, each time I try ?

14:20.986 --> 14:23.588
? I just break down and cry ?

14:23.589 --> 14:25.456
? Pain in my head ?

14:25.457 --> 14:28.593
? Oh, I'd rather be dead ?

14:28.594 --> 14:33.030
? Spinning around and around
and around and around ?

14:33.032 --> 14:34.532
? Although we've come ?

14:34.533 --> 14:36.100
Move.

14:36.101 --> 14:39.937
? To the end of the road ?

14:39.938 --> 14:41.239
Hands up, come on.

14:41.240 --> 14:44.308
? Still I can't let go ?

14:44.309 --> 14:47.145
? It's unnatural ?

14:52.284 --> 14:55.119
? Yeah ?

14:55.120 --> 14:57.121
? Whoo-ooh-ooh ?

14:57.122 --> 14:58.122
You're an idiot.

15:00.159 --> 15:02.527
But you're very cute.

15:04.096 --> 15:05.563
And that's what happened.

15:05.564 --> 15:07.899
And that's exactly the
way I remembered it,

15:07.900 --> 15:11.402
except I was a lot more on key?

15:11.403 --> 15:16.140
So, jury, I think it's pretty
obvious who won this trial.

15:16.141 --> 15:17.275
Please.

15:17.276 --> 15:19.944
You lost me at "no tickets."

15:19.945 --> 15:21.612
I have to side with Dad.

15:21.613 --> 15:25.249
He buys all my sneakers,
so no shade, Mom.

15:25.250 --> 15:27.752
I'm with Mommy because Zack's with Daddy.

15:27.753 --> 15:30.021
These are all biased conclusions.

15:30.022 --> 15:33.324
It's like none of you
understand the jury process.

15:33.325 --> 15:37.295
I'm going to need a couple of
hours to pore over the evidence.

15:37.296 --> 15:39.330
Okay, hung jury. Case dismissed.

15:39.331 --> 15:40.665
We're not going to Miccello's.

15:40.666 --> 15:42.633
Ash, what are you talking about?

15:42.634 --> 15:44.802
We just proved we had a great night.

15:44.803 --> 15:46.337
No, Marlon.

15:46.338 --> 15:48.506
We proved that we had some good moments

15:48.507 --> 15:49.807
and some bad moments,

15:49.808 --> 15:51.275
just like our marriage.

15:51.276 --> 15:53.611
But, for some reason,
at the end of the day,

15:53.612 --> 15:57.181
we didn't get to make it, and that's sad.

15:57.182 --> 15:59.350
So I think this is a tradition

15:59.351 --> 16:01.686
that you're just going
to have to let go of.

16:07.126 --> 16:09.327
Well, I'm sure you're
going to let this go,

16:09.328 --> 16:11.957
and That'll be the end of that.

16:20.596 --> 16:21.932
Really, Marlon?

16:21.933 --> 16:24.322
I tell you that I don't want
to celebrate our anniversary,

16:24.323 --> 16:26.791
so you lure me here
by stealing my iPhone?

16:26.792 --> 16:27.506
Ugh.

16:27.507 --> 16:29.241
Well, I had to get you here somehow.

16:29.242 --> 16:30.475
Hey.

16:30.476 --> 16:32.678
Hey, Ashley.

16:32.679 --> 16:35.247
Hey, listen, you're right.

16:35.248 --> 16:37.282
We shouldn't celebrate our anniversary.

16:37.283 --> 16:39.951
That's what I've been
trying to tell you, Marlon.

16:39.952 --> 16:43.588
Fine, I'll let the
anniversary celebration go,

16:43.589 --> 16:46.454
but I have one question to ask you.

16:48.660 --> 16:51.630
Would you marry me?

16:51.631 --> 16:54.700
Can you please get up off the floor?

16:54.701 --> 16:56.635
Girl, I didn't say, "Will you marry me?"

16:56.636 --> 16:59.538
I said, "Would you marry me?"

16:59.539 --> 17:02.040
Knowing all that you know now,

17:02.041 --> 17:03.975
that we'd have a failed marriage,

17:03.976 --> 17:05.944
we'd have two beautiful kids,

17:05.944 --> 17:08.280
this wonderful friendship,

17:08.281 --> 17:13.018
would you do it again?

17:13.019 --> 17:14.986
Of course, I would.

17:14.987 --> 17:17.888
And so would I.

17:17.890 --> 17:22.560
So from now on, we'll
celebrate our family,

17:22.561 --> 17:26.031
our friendship.

17:26.031 --> 17:29.601
That'll be the new tradition.

17:29.602 --> 17:32.970
That's a tradition I can get behind.

17:34.706 --> 17:38.877
And, I'm sorry if, in our marriage,

17:38.878 --> 17:42.214
I didn't follow through
with all my promises.

17:42.215 --> 17:44.182
But, in divorce,

17:44.183 --> 17:47.352
I promise you I will.

17:47.353 --> 17:51.990
And I promise you, I'm
going to hold you to that.

17:51.991 --> 17:54.859
Damn, we just did divorce vows.

17:58.864 --> 18:02.067
And you may kick the groom.

18:02.068 --> 18:04.336
Instead of "I do," you say "I don't."

18:04.337 --> 18:06.338
- I don't either.
- Well, forget you then.

18:06.339 --> 18:08.939
- Forget you.
- The ring, take it.

18:10.909 --> 18:12.244
- Come here.
- What?

18:12.245 --> 18:15.680
- Cuckoo!
- What is going on?

18:15.681 --> 18:17.182
Oh.

18:17.183 --> 18:20.252
We're about to start our new tradition.

18:20.253 --> 18:23.255
We're celebrating our family anniversary,

18:23.256 --> 18:25.557
but first, I feel like I need

18:25.558 --> 18:28.260
- to make good on something.
- Oh, my god, Marlon.

18:28.261 --> 18:30.629
Please tell me you're not going to sing.

18:30.630 --> 18:34.599
No, I'm not going to sing. They are.

18:34.600 --> 18:37.235
? Although we've come ?

18:37.236 --> 18:41.773
? To the end of the road ?

18:41.774 --> 18:45.677
? Still I can't let you go ?

18:45.678 --> 18:47.846
? It's unnatural ?

18:47.847 --> 18:49.948
? You belong to me ?

18:49.949 --> 18:52.250
? I belong to you ?

18:52.251 --> 18:53.885
? Come ?

18:53.886 --> 18:57.989
? To the end of the road ?

18:57.990 --> 19:01.726
? Still I can't let you go ?

19:01.727 --> 19:03.895
? It's unnatural ?

19:03.896 --> 19:05.864
? You belong to me ?

19:05.865 --> 19:09.601
? I belong to you ?

19:11.671 --> 19:13.305
Girl.

19:13.306 --> 19:18.009
I always wanted to do one
of these sexy R&B breakdowns,

19:18.010 --> 19:19.978
with the deep voice,

19:19.979 --> 19:22.113
but, man, this is a lot doper

19:22.114 --> 19:25.250
than I even anticipated.

19:25.251 --> 19:28.320
But, you know, we're divorced now.

19:28.321 --> 19:31.690
And, although our marriage
may have come to an end,

19:31.691 --> 19:34.326
our family never will.

19:34.327 --> 19:37.863
And marriage is just like divorce,

19:37.864 --> 19:40.397
because you don't have
sex either way it goes.

19:43.702 --> 19:47.138
You know, I remember the day

19:47.139 --> 19:49.908
that we first made the baby girl.

19:49.909 --> 19:52.143
I knew you was prego with her,

19:52.144 --> 19:55.847
because you cried like a crack baby.

19:55.848 --> 19:59.117
And then with him, oh, you were so mean

19:59.118 --> 20:00.485
and hungry, girl.

20:00.486 --> 20:01.987
You were hungry.

20:01.988 --> 20:03.321
"Give me these snacks.

20:03.322 --> 20:04.956
"Give me some cookies.

20:04.957 --> 20:06.992
Give me some of this. Rub my feet."

20:06.993 --> 20:11.029
I said this, "Is she pregnant
with a boy or with a demon?"

20:11.030 --> 20:14.332
And I was right. It was a demon.

20:14.333 --> 20:16.001
But you two lovely friends

20:16.002 --> 20:20.038
celebrating our
consummation of each other.

20:20.039 --> 20:22.205
Stevie, I still don't know
what the hell you're doing

20:22.206 --> 20:23.975
with that Afro.

20:23.976 --> 20:27.145
It look like a tumbleweed out of...

20:27.146 --> 20:29.781
out of an old Western

20:29.782 --> 20:32.951
with glasses on.

20:32.952 --> 20:37.289
And Yvette, this moment's for friends.

20:37.290 --> 20:41.126
I don't know why the hell you're here.

20:41.127 --> 20:44.963
But I want you to know,
baby girl, I love you.

20:44.964 --> 20:46.331
? I belong to you ?

20:46.332 --> 20:47.799
Don't try to kiss me on my lips.

20:47.800 --> 20:50.368
I saw.

20:50.369 --> 20:54.104
Thank you!
