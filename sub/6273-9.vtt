00:00.066 --> 00:02.001
Narrator:  <i>Previously on</i>
<i>masters of sex...</i>

00:02.003 --> 00:04.003
We decided to begin
our work on

00:04.005 --> 00:05.304
Dysfunction
with male impotence.

00:05.306 --> 00:08.507
I'm just like those guys
in the, you know,

00:08.509 --> 00:09.541
Dysfunctional way.

00:09.543 --> 00:11.777
Are you going
to join me?

00:11.779 --> 00:13.645
I may have overdone it.

00:13.647 --> 00:17.549
I'm not sure I'd be of...
Uh, much use.

00:17.551 --> 00:18.517
I thought you
were going home.

00:18.519 --> 00:21.587
We decided we didn't
want anyone else
doing the treatments.

00:21.589 --> 00:24.456
I've spent most
of my life pretending
you don't exist.

00:24.458 --> 00:28.160
If people would
ask me, I'd tell them
I was an only child.

00:28.162 --> 00:29.161
I want my brother back.

00:29.163 --> 00:30.562
Look, we got a couple
of witnesses...

00:30.564 --> 00:32.564
<i>...Who saw</i>
<i>the truck drive by</i>

00:32.566 --> 00:34.033
<i>And saw leonard</i>
<i>get dumped out the back.</i>

00:34.035 --> 00:36.268
<i>And so I was wondering</i>
<i>if maybe you saw anything.</i>

00:36.270 --> 00:37.770
Libby:  <i>If there</i>
<i>are other witnesses,</i>

00:37.772 --> 00:39.338
Why are you
talking to me?

00:39.340 --> 00:41.640
What was his name?
Your first?

00:41.642 --> 00:43.675
(crying)
I'd remembered his name.

00:43.677 --> 00:44.676
Paul.

00:44.678 --> 00:45.611
But wasn't
your brother...

00:45.613 --> 00:47.780
We had this creek
that ran behind our house

00:47.782 --> 00:51.750
And we'd catch frogs
and have them race.

00:51.752 --> 00:53.952
Who is the best
psychologist
in st. Louis?

00:53.954 --> 00:55.687
Lloyd madden, maybe.
Let's call him.

00:55.689 --> 00:56.855
We can give him
the basics of
barbara's case.

00:56.857 --> 01:00.392
No reputable physician
would consent to giving
a medical opinion

01:00.394 --> 01:01.560
On a patient
they haven't met.

01:01.562 --> 01:03.662
Barbara:
<i>You cannot expect</i>
<i>me to sit down</i>

01:03.664 --> 01:06.231
With a complete
stranger, a, a man.

01:06.233 --> 01:08.400
I'm sorry,
virginia, I can't.

01:08.402 --> 01:10.269
My brother and I,
we would spend...

01:10.271 --> 01:13.072
Every day down there
chasing frogs and...

01:13.074 --> 01:17.476
As we got older,
the games...

01:17.478 --> 01:19.578
They changed.

01:20.613 --> 01:23.282
(theme music playing)

02:07.193 --> 02:08.460
That's...

02:08.462 --> 02:10.629
I think everything.

02:10.631 --> 02:12.264
My story.

02:20.406 --> 02:21.507
I don't know
how this works.

02:21.509 --> 02:24.176
I've never done
this before so...

02:24.178 --> 02:26.745
Do you ask
me questions?

02:28.214 --> 02:30.315
How can
I help you?

02:30.317 --> 02:31.416
Why are you here?

02:31.418 --> 02:33.619
Well, I suppose,
I would like to know

02:33.621 --> 02:38.123
How to put what
happened to me
in its proper place,

02:38.125 --> 02:41.660
To not think about it
all the time, every day.

02:41.662 --> 02:43.428
It's a process,
barbara.

02:43.430 --> 02:45.297
Not a checklist.

02:45.565 --> 02:46.064
Of course,

02:46.066 --> 02:48.700
But if you had any
specific suggestions...

02:48.702 --> 02:52.070
You know what's
interesting about
your story?

02:52.072 --> 02:55.407
Your voice,
when you tell it.

02:55.409 --> 02:57.309
Those are difficult
things you're
speaking of...

02:57.311 --> 02:59.811
...Being
sexually abused
by your brother.

02:59.813 --> 03:02.281
Your mother finding
you and him together

03:02.283 --> 03:03.982
And yet never
speaking of it.

03:03.984 --> 03:07.920
The judgment
and rejection you
felt from her,

03:07.922 --> 03:10.189
The repulsion you
felt for yourself.

03:10.191 --> 03:11.523
And one might
expect the telling

03:11.525 --> 03:13.959
Of such
terrible things

03:13.961 --> 03:16.995
To summon up some
very strong feelings...

03:16.997 --> 03:18.530
Pain...

03:18.898 --> 03:20.566
Rage...

03:20.568 --> 03:22.467
Sadness.

03:22.469 --> 03:24.136
But it didn't
for you.

03:24.138 --> 03:25.737
It was almost as if
you were describing
something

03:25.739 --> 03:29.007
That happened
to someone else.

03:29.342 --> 03:31.777
Well, it didn't.
It happened to me.

03:31.779 --> 03:35.614
And I'm sorry
that I wasn't emoting
enough, but...

03:35.616 --> 03:38.050
Were there tears
when it happened?

03:38.052 --> 03:40.118
Yes, of course.

03:40.553 --> 03:41.987
A 12-year-old girl,
she...

03:41.989 --> 03:45.490
...Cries when she's
being penetrated
for the first time.

03:45.492 --> 03:48.794
Were you that
12-year-old girl?

03:48.895 --> 03:51.363
Yes, I told you.

03:51.798 --> 03:55.834
Then why not say "I"?
"I cried."

03:55.836 --> 03:57.903
Well, I did.

03:57.905 --> 04:00.505
And I've cried plenty
in telling the story,

04:00.507 --> 04:02.040
Maybe not tonight,
but I have.

04:02.042 --> 04:06.111
Hmm. To whom
have you told it?

04:06.212 --> 04:07.946
Just a friend...

04:07.948 --> 04:11.883
Someone who
wants to help but
does not know how.

04:11.885 --> 04:14.886
Someone who
doesn't know what
to do besides just

04:14.888 --> 04:17.990
Listen to me
as I go on and on.

04:17.992 --> 04:19.491
Perhaps
you keep reliving
your experience

04:19.493 --> 04:23.362
Because each time
you're hoping it'll have
a different outcome.

04:23.364 --> 04:27.666
So how would
you rewrite your
story, barbara?

04:27.668 --> 04:29.334
I can't.

04:29.535 --> 04:31.603
It happened.
I can't change it.

04:31.605 --> 04:32.471
What if
you could?

04:32.473 --> 04:34.740
Where would you begin?
What would you say...

04:34.742 --> 04:37.809
...To make it
end differently?

04:38.444 --> 04:40.579
I don't know.

04:40.581 --> 04:43.215
I guess I... I would...

04:43.217 --> 04:44.950
Tell my brother to stop?

04:44.952 --> 04:47.386
That's right. Say it.

04:47.388 --> 04:51.323
Stop?
As a little girl.
Not as a woman.

04:53.459 --> 04:55.427
Stop!
Yes.

04:55.429 --> 04:56.862
Yes, find
that voice.

04:56.864 --> 04:58.397
Speak as your
12-year-old self.

04:58.399 --> 05:02.601
Imagine telling
your brother what you
wanted to say then...

05:02.603 --> 05:04.870
...But couldn't.

05:05.271 --> 05:07.272
Start there.

05:10.376 --> 05:12.277
Estabrooks:
Libby, take a bow.

05:12.279 --> 05:14.313
She really is
the best cook!

05:14.315 --> 05:15.480
Isn't she, bill?

05:15.482 --> 05:16.048
She is, indeed.

05:16.050 --> 05:17.916
Well, I used to be
more adventurous,

05:17.918 --> 05:19.785
But johnny's going
through a phase.

05:19.787 --> 05:21.520
Nothing but
buttered noodles.

05:21.522 --> 05:23.455
You know how picky
children can be.

05:23.457 --> 05:26.825
Oh, well, you don't yet,
but you will very soon.

05:26.827 --> 05:29.528
All systems go
for Wednesday?

05:29.762 --> 05:31.330
Pauline: (sighs)
libby,

05:31.332 --> 05:35.500
Frank got me
a fondue set a few
christmases ago.

05:35.502 --> 05:38.403
Oh, I just
love fondue.
Pauline: Still in the box!

05:38.405 --> 05:40.272
He didn't realize...

05:40.274 --> 05:42.040
Oh, I'm so sorry.

05:42.042 --> 05:43.442
Not at all.

05:43.444 --> 05:45.344
I thought it was
just melted cheese.

05:45.346 --> 05:46.278
Turns out there's a...

05:46.280 --> 05:48.313
A lot of booze
in the recipe.

05:48.315 --> 05:49.648
Pauline:
It's nearly half wine.

05:49.650 --> 05:51.717
Well, if I can't offer
anyone seconds...

05:51.719 --> 05:53.385
Oh, let me
help you there.

05:53.387 --> 05:55.721
Francis:
It really was delicious.

05:55.723 --> 05:57.422
Libby, thank you.

05:57.424 --> 05:59.391
A clean plate
is the best compliment.

05:59.393 --> 06:00.492
Estabrooks:
Would you look at that?

06:00.494 --> 06:02.160
I thought I would
go to my grave

06:02.162 --> 06:04.496
Before I saw francis
eat a green vegetable.

06:04.498 --> 06:05.697
Pauline: Oh, nowadays
he'll eat salad, even.

06:05.699 --> 06:07.899
Estabrooks: I could
never get either one
of them to eat fish,

06:07.901 --> 06:11.136
No matter how much sauce
I used to disguise it...

06:11.138 --> 06:14.940
It's a very
handsome house
you have here, bill.

06:14.942 --> 06:17.676
It burns off,
doesn't it?

06:17.678 --> 06:18.043
Sorry?

06:18.045 --> 06:21.146
The wine.
The alcohol content.

06:21.148 --> 06:21.947
When you heat it up,

06:21.949 --> 06:26.985
Ethanol evaporates
when it reaches
a boiling point.

06:26.987 --> 06:28.920
It's basic science.

06:30.123 --> 06:31.022
Nevertheless,

06:31.024 --> 06:33.992
We don't bring
liquor into the house.

06:34.193 --> 06:37.028
So, is this
a problem for you?

06:37.030 --> 06:39.264
Being around this?

06:39.365 --> 06:40.565
(sighs)

06:40.567 --> 06:42.134
Not today.

06:42.136 --> 06:46.538
Although mom
seems a little tight,
don't you think?

06:46.540 --> 06:48.640
(clears throat)
no.

06:48.642 --> 06:50.475
I think she's happy.

06:50.477 --> 06:53.211
I didn't know you had
friends in st. Louis.

06:53.213 --> 06:55.480
Not friends exactly.

06:55.482 --> 06:57.149
And they're frank's,
not mine.

06:57.151 --> 06:59.684
I'm glad bill's
agreed to meet them
tomorrow night.

06:59.686 --> 07:02.721
You mean,
he wants them
to meet bill.

07:02.723 --> 07:03.221
(chuckles)

07:03.223 --> 07:04.856
And I don't blame
him for wanting
to show off

07:04.858 --> 07:07.192
His accomplished
big brother.

07:07.194 --> 07:10.595
It's so wonderful
having them
both together.

07:10.597 --> 07:13.098
I don't recall ever
seeing her drink.

07:13.100 --> 07:14.266
Well, she never
drank scotch,

07:14.268 --> 07:17.669
Which is what
dad had around
the house.

07:17.671 --> 07:20.071
Now she likes
the occasional...

07:20.073 --> 07:22.674
...Tom collins
or two.

07:23.176 --> 07:24.309
Or three?

07:24.311 --> 07:26.411
Libby: Show of hands
for coffee, please.

07:26.413 --> 07:30.715
Oh, I left some files
in the office over
the weekend.

07:30.717 --> 07:31.683
Pauline: Oh, no!

07:31.685 --> 07:33.518
Estabrooks:
You're leaving now?

07:33.520 --> 07:34.219
Can't it wait?

07:34.221 --> 07:35.754
I have a patient
early tomorrow, um,

07:35.756 --> 07:40.625
Woman with a complicated
medical history
I need to review.

07:40.627 --> 07:41.693
Well, why don't
I go with you?

07:41.695 --> 07:42.661
Keep you company
on the drive.

07:42.663 --> 07:43.728
Estabrooks:
Oh, that's a fine idea.

07:43.730 --> 07:46.131
That neighborhood
is bad enough
in the daytime,

07:46.133 --> 07:47.899
As libby
certainly can attest.

07:47.901 --> 07:50.001
My god, such
a harrowing story.

07:50.003 --> 07:53.238
Not necessary, sit.
Enjoy dessert.

07:53.240 --> 07:55.307
I caught a whiff
of it earlier.

07:55.309 --> 07:58.009
You are in
for a treat.

07:58.578 --> 08:00.178
Libby: It's a rum cake.

08:00.180 --> 08:03.215
I didn't realize.
I made a rum cake.

08:03.217 --> 08:06.151
Which I'm sure
will be sensational.

08:06.153 --> 08:08.653
I'll be just fine
with coffee.

08:09.288 --> 08:10.355
(door closes)

08:10.357 --> 08:11.623
(keys jingle)

08:11.625 --> 08:14.493
Did you see what's
going on downstairs?

08:14.495 --> 08:16.761
No.
Really?

08:16.763 --> 08:18.930
You didn't notice
dozens of young women

08:18.932 --> 08:22.100
In sashes and tiaras
down in the lobby?

08:22.468 --> 08:25.103
It's the miss buoy
of st. Louey pageant.

08:25.105 --> 08:26.771
I guess
I must've been
preoccupied.

08:26.773 --> 08:30.675
Just so happens,
I was a pageant
girl myself.

08:30.677 --> 08:32.711
Runner-up,
miss teen fayetteville.

08:32.713 --> 08:35.180
What did the winner
have that you didn't?

08:35.182 --> 08:39.217
An uncanny resemblance
to veronica lake.

08:39.219 --> 08:39.951
Ah.

08:39.953 --> 08:40.986
God, I hated
those things.

08:40.988 --> 08:44.189
I never would've done it
if my mother hadn't
forced me to sign up.

08:44.191 --> 08:47.993
My mother could
be a little deaf

08:47.995 --> 08:50.161
When it came
to listening to me.

08:50.163 --> 08:51.429
(water running)

08:51.431 --> 08:53.598
I should've
just said, "no."

08:53.600 --> 08:57.235
Loud enough for her
to have really heard.

08:58.871 --> 09:00.305
No!

09:01.140 --> 09:02.507
(scoffs)

09:02.509 --> 09:03.842
And what's got you
so preoccupied?

09:03.844 --> 09:05.477
Where are
you coming from?
Oh...

09:05.479 --> 09:08.780
Uh, family dinner
with my mother.

09:08.782 --> 09:11.316
Mmm, how was that?

09:13.553 --> 09:18.323
Why don't you take
your dress off?
Come over here.

09:19.058 --> 09:22.127
And why don't you
take your pants off...

09:22.129 --> 09:23.828
...And come
over here?

09:23.830 --> 09:27.065
I was looking
forward to, uh,

09:27.067 --> 09:30.135
Taking care
of you tonight.

09:30.137 --> 09:32.804
Where's the fun
in that for you?

09:32.806 --> 09:34.940
I enjoy watching you...

09:34.942 --> 09:37.175
...Enjoying yourself.

09:37.177 --> 09:42.213
That's becoming
standard operating
procedure these days.

09:46.118 --> 09:49.321
Well, for a change
of pace then,

09:49.323 --> 09:53.992
Why don't we reverse
the arrangement?

09:56.062 --> 09:58.196
Why don't you...

10:00.232 --> 10:02.200
Lie back...

10:03.903 --> 10:04.769
(exhales deeply)

10:04.771 --> 10:07.772
...And let me
take care of you?

10:10.610 --> 10:12.444
I've, uh, I've...

10:12.446 --> 10:15.580
I've just come
from libby.

10:18.217 --> 10:19.184
But you said dinner
with your mother.

10:19.186 --> 10:22.554
She went early
and libby and I...
I see.

10:24.423 --> 10:26.257
(exhales sharply)

10:26.259 --> 10:29.060
Does that
happen a lot?

10:29.362 --> 10:33.732
Her to me?
Or from me to her?

10:35.067 --> 10:36.668
Never mind.
I shouldn't have
said anything.

10:36.670 --> 10:39.938
No, I...
Should not
have asked.

10:46.345 --> 10:48.980
(alcohol pouring)
(bottle thuds)

10:49.181 --> 10:53.151
Maybe we
should just take
a rain check tonight.

10:57.123 --> 10:58.356
Kitty:
I'm just curious,

10:58.358 --> 11:00.091
How did you
get my number?

11:00.093 --> 11:02.027
William:
Well, miss dimello
said you came...

11:02.029 --> 11:05.864
...Highly recommended
by, uh...

11:06.832 --> 11:07.465
By...

11:07.467 --> 11:10.869
Judge tillinghast.
We go way back. Way.

11:10.871 --> 11:14.706
Apparently,
he had some very nice
things to say about you.

11:14.708 --> 11:17.242
Said you took initiative.

11:17.244 --> 11:19.611
Always found
creative solutions.

11:19.613 --> 11:21.913
You very imaginative.
And flexible.

11:21.915 --> 11:23.515
The judge
said, "flexible."

11:23.517 --> 11:27.018
Oh, yes, very flexible.
Gymnastics as a kid.

11:27.020 --> 11:29.287
And you're clear
about what the job is.

11:29.289 --> 11:29.888
Blow job, hand job,

11:29.890 --> 11:31.322
Whatever it takes
to get the job done.

11:31.324 --> 11:34.626
It's not that this
guy's pecker has
never worked, is it?

11:34.628 --> 11:37.562
No, he's had some
unfortunate interactions

11:37.564 --> 11:41.666
With women that have
left him, uh, non-functioning

11:41.668 --> 11:42.500
For the past few years.

11:42.502 --> 11:43.468
You've dealt
with men like that

11:43.470 --> 11:46.638
Suffering erectile
dysfunction for an extended
period of time?

11:46.640 --> 11:50.075
Impotence is a working
girl's bread and butter.
Am I right, kitty?

11:50.077 --> 11:51.910
Oh, sure.
See it all
the time.

11:51.912 --> 11:56.481
Now, mr. Linden is
the, uh, nervous type.

11:56.483 --> 11:58.049
A gentle approach
may be most effective,

11:58.051 --> 12:01.152
But we'll leave that
to your discretion.
(door opens)

12:01.154 --> 12:03.088
Mmm,
speak of the devil.

12:04.657 --> 12:05.190
(coughs)

12:05.192 --> 12:09.160
Betty: He's a certain charm,
kitty, wouldn't you say?

12:09.962 --> 12:11.696
I've seen worse.

12:11.698 --> 12:13.131
I don't know,
dr. Masters,

12:13.133 --> 12:14.666
It's a really nice
offer and everything,

12:14.668 --> 12:17.502
But if you wanted
to let me know I was
doing a good job,

12:17.504 --> 12:21.306
Some extra
cash at christmas
would be great.

12:21.308 --> 12:22.941
Is it hot in here?
This isn't a bonus.

12:22.943 --> 12:26.544
It's an opportunity to
participate in the work.

12:26.546 --> 12:28.713
Aren't I already
participating?

12:28.715 --> 12:30.682
As a subject.

12:31.283 --> 12:33.585
Is that a good idea?
I mean, to cross that line.

12:33.587 --> 12:37.622
Isn't it best to
maintain some professional
objectivity?

12:37.624 --> 12:40.325
That's outweighed
by the value of having

12:40.327 --> 12:42.393
An insider
participate, you know,

12:42.395 --> 12:46.264
Someone like you
who's observed
the subtle nuances

12:46.266 --> 12:50.635
Of sexual arousal
and can speak
to them personally.

12:50.637 --> 12:52.437
I need a little air.

12:55.274 --> 12:55.974
But... But...

12:55.976 --> 12:58.376
Why do I have
to do it with
a girl like that?

12:58.378 --> 13:01.513
How else
are we to eliminate
the question

13:01.515 --> 13:04.115
Of your partner's
sexual competence?

13:04.117 --> 13:07.385
In a controlled experiment,
there can only
be one variable.

13:07.387 --> 13:10.388
So we need to partner
you with a woman whose...

13:10.390 --> 13:11.856
Whose sexual
competence
is not a factor,

13:11.858 --> 13:15.493
Someone who's...
Who's come across
this problem before,

13:15.495 --> 13:20.799
Often, and has some
ideas of how to treat it.

13:21.300 --> 13:23.368
I am... I am...

13:23.502 --> 13:29.073
I am offering
you the chance
to be a pioneer.

13:29.075 --> 13:30.875
You know, like, um...

13:31.143 --> 13:32.644
Like wilbur wright

13:32.646 --> 13:38.082
Flying over the heads
of the doubting french

13:38.084 --> 13:39.884
At le mans.

13:39.886 --> 13:41.820
There's film of
that, you know.

13:41.822 --> 13:45.023
A year later, 1909,
first aerial shots.

13:45.025 --> 13:48.626
There's history to
be made here, lester.

13:49.428 --> 13:51.563
Marcus: What made
you look up, mrs. Masters?

13:51.565 --> 13:53.431
Libby: Well, um,
the sound of the truck,

13:53.433 --> 13:54.432
The squeal
of the tires.

13:54.434 --> 13:56.534
And how close would
you say you were to it
when it passed you?

13:56.536 --> 14:01.673
I guess the distance
from here to...
About there?

14:02.041 --> 14:04.042
How's your vision,
mrs. Masters?

14:04.044 --> 14:05.210
Can you read
the sign there?

14:05.212 --> 14:08.580
"the law of the land
is our demand."

14:08.582 --> 14:09.647
Are those letters
about the same size

14:09.649 --> 14:13.451
As numbers on a license
plate, wouldn't you say?

14:13.453 --> 14:14.285
Well, I didn't...

14:14.287 --> 14:16.421
As I said, the truck
went by so fast.

14:16.423 --> 14:17.555
I saw that it was
old and blue,

14:17.557 --> 14:20.959
Uh, with
an engine that had
a terrible rattle to it.

14:20.961 --> 14:24.362
Uh, by the time
I got in my car and
turned the corner, um,

14:24.364 --> 14:26.431
I saw mister, uh...

14:26.433 --> 14:28.933
Sorry, I forgot that
poor man's name.

14:28.935 --> 14:29.934
Robert: Gilroy.

14:29.936 --> 14:31.135
Leonard gilroy.

14:31.137 --> 14:34.706
Mr. Gilroy...
On the curb.

14:34.708 --> 14:37.442
Marcus: It was
a distressing sight,
wasn't it?

14:37.444 --> 14:40.345
A man bound and gagged,
his body thrown to the curb

14:40.347 --> 14:42.313
Like a sack of grain.

14:42.315 --> 14:43.214
It was terrible.

14:43.216 --> 14:45.984
Had you ever seen
anything like it before?

14:46.552 --> 14:47.418
No.

14:47.420 --> 14:51.322
It shakes a person up,
doesn't it? Rattles you?

14:51.324 --> 14:56.194
You know, when I'm rattled,
I forget things... Details.

14:56.196 --> 14:58.363
You know, maybe there
are a few you forgot.

14:58.365 --> 14:59.697
Robert:
She can't help, marcus.

14:59.699 --> 15:00.465
She didn't see it happen.

15:00.467 --> 15:02.600
She wasn't
an eyewitness.
No, I didn't hear

15:02.602 --> 15:05.136
Mrs. Masters expressly
say that, robert.

15:05.138 --> 15:06.571
Well, I...
I wanna make sure

15:06.573 --> 15:09.407
You understand
the stakes
here, ma'am.

15:09.409 --> 15:11.509
Before you commit
to an answer,

15:11.511 --> 15:14.445
The stakes might
jog your memory and
cause you to recollect

15:14.447 --> 15:17.949
The situation differently
than when you
and robert first spoke.

15:17.951 --> 15:21.786
For example,
you might recollect
that you were already

15:21.788 --> 15:24.489
In your car
when that truck
passed you,

15:24.491 --> 15:26.257
But you were just
a second behind it

15:26.259 --> 15:27.759
When you turned
onto slocum,
close enough to see

15:27.761 --> 15:29.727
That the first
three numbers of
the license plate

15:29.729 --> 15:34.799
Were 2-8-9 right
before you saw
leonard gilroy

15:34.801 --> 15:37.201
Thrown off the
back of that truck.

15:37.970 --> 15:41.105
It would be very
helpful, mrs. Masters,

15:41.107 --> 15:42.740
If you recollected that.

15:42.742 --> 15:45.944
Because I'm sorry
to say that the st. Louis
police department

15:45.946 --> 15:48.112
Thinks people
with your color eyes

15:48.114 --> 15:51.349
See better than people
with my color eyes.

15:58.924 --> 16:01.125
What are you doing?
We have a patient coming.

16:01.127 --> 16:02.727
I know,
vaginismus, right?

16:02.729 --> 16:03.828
Dr. Masters
said it was okay.

16:03.830 --> 16:05.830
I haven't documented
a single vaginismus yet.

16:05.832 --> 16:09.300
We are seeing a woman,
lester, not a dysfunction.

16:09.302 --> 16:11.002
She's just
beginning treatment.

16:11.004 --> 16:12.537
She's self-conscious
enough as it is

16:12.539 --> 16:14.138
Without a camera
trained on her.

16:14.140 --> 16:15.106
But dr. Masters said...

16:15.108 --> 16:18.142
I'm saying that
it's too soon.

16:18.144 --> 16:19.677
Out.

16:22.748 --> 16:23.948
William:  <i>Vaginismus</i>
<i>is the loss of...</i>

16:23.950 --> 16:29.354
...Control over the muscles
of the perineum and the
outer third of the vagina.

16:29.356 --> 16:31.856
These muscles
contract spastically

16:31.858 --> 16:36.461
In response to entry
or even the suggestion
of entry.

16:36.463 --> 16:37.462
Couldn't it
be a holiday?

16:37.464 --> 16:39.163
Doesn't it sound
like a holiday?

16:39.165 --> 16:42.600
The feast
of vaginismus!

16:42.602 --> 16:45.370
Uh, virginia has
explained to you

16:45.372 --> 16:48.106
The importance of
a vaginal examination?

16:48.108 --> 16:49.007
Barbara: Yes.

16:49.009 --> 16:51.309
William: Have you've
been penetrated before?

16:52.311 --> 16:56.314
Uh, when I was
very young, yes.

16:56.316 --> 16:58.282
Without difficulty?

16:58.350 --> 17:00.018
Dr. Masters means
physical difficulty.

17:00.020 --> 17:04.455
We understand that
there was a difficult
emotional component.

17:04.457 --> 17:09.260
Uh, when...
When he first
put it inside me,

17:09.262 --> 17:12.096
It, it hurt,
and there was
a little blood.

17:12.098 --> 17:15.299
And after
the first time?

17:15.834 --> 17:18.503
Uh, the...
The pain was lessened.

17:18.505 --> 17:20.071
But then once
I realized that

17:20.073 --> 17:23.041
The circumstances
were inappropriate...

17:23.043 --> 17:25.376
Does he know
who I was with?

17:25.378 --> 17:27.845
He does.

17:28.814 --> 17:30.815
After that,
the intercourse
stopped,

17:30.817 --> 17:36.754
And then years later
when I tried to
have relations...

17:36.756 --> 17:40.091
Vaginal relations...
With gil... My fiance...

17:40.093 --> 17:45.096
It was as if
I had closed up
entirely down there.

17:45.631 --> 17:49.067
Okay, so what
we're gonna do
today is, uh,

17:49.069 --> 17:53.137
Help you understand
how your body
has been responding,

17:53.139 --> 17:56.841
How the muscles
constrict physically
to prevent penetration.

17:56.843 --> 18:02.146
So, first, I will
be inserting a dilator
into your vagina.

18:02.148 --> 18:04.482
(stammering)
today? Now?

18:04.484 --> 18:08.920
We're gonna go
very slowly, very gently
with lubrication.

18:10.989 --> 18:11.622
All right.

18:11.624 --> 18:13.758
And then, uh,
once the dilator
is inside you,

18:13.760 --> 18:16.394
You're gonna
feel yourself
clenching around it.

18:16.396 --> 18:18.496
Uh, but without
the back and forth
of intercourse,

18:18.498 --> 18:23.901
The muscles will relax
and begin to comfortably
accommodate it.

18:24.636 --> 18:27.105
(voice breaks)
don't mind me.

18:27.339 --> 18:29.707
(speaking inaudibly)

18:39.685 --> 18:42.787
(continues
speaking inaudibly)

19:07.613 --> 19:09.247
(crying)

19:13.152 --> 19:14.919
Barb, we don't
have to do this today.

19:14.921 --> 19:18.089
No, no, no, no,
I want to. I...

19:18.091 --> 19:21.058
I wanna get
it over with.
All right.

19:22.394 --> 19:23.961
Deep breath.

19:23.963 --> 19:27.131
I'm gonna
go very slowly.

19:27.133 --> 19:30.268
(barbara gasps)

19:30.270 --> 19:33.204
(sobbing)

19:33.206 --> 19:35.873
I'm sorry! No, no,
I can't, I can't!

19:35.875 --> 19:37.108
I can't, please!

19:37.110 --> 19:38.809
No. I don't know
what's wrong with me.

19:38.811 --> 19:43.748
Why don't we just give
barb a few moments
to herself, shall we?

19:49.021 --> 19:50.154
You know how I feel
about this, bill.

19:50.156 --> 19:52.456
We are only treating
one half of the problem.

19:52.458 --> 19:54.792
Yes, the half we can
do something about.

19:54.794 --> 19:57.128
Every patient
with sexual dysfunction

19:57.130 --> 19:59.263
Is going to experience
some kind of distress.

19:59.265 --> 20:01.532
It's the distress
that brings them here.

20:01.534 --> 20:03.367
Yes, it is terrible
for them.

20:03.369 --> 20:05.469
And yes, it is hard
to stand by and watch.

20:05.471 --> 20:06.704
But are we gonna
turn them away

20:06.706 --> 20:09.440
When we have
the means to treat
their physical symptoms?

20:09.442 --> 20:11.375
We are clearing
the way for her

20:11.377 --> 20:12.743
To have intercourse
that she is

20:12.745 --> 20:13.945
Psychologically
unprepared for.

20:13.947 --> 20:16.948
And why do you assume
that some kind of
emotional breakthrough

20:16.950 --> 20:18.316
Is gonna relieve
her physical problems?

20:18.318 --> 20:21.886
We can offer
a practical treatment,
virginia.

20:21.888 --> 20:25.990
Anything else,
and we are out
of our depth.

20:25.992 --> 20:30.194
Now let's go back in
and try again.

20:34.633 --> 20:37.401
(telephone rings in distance)

20:50.015 --> 20:52.049
I'm... I'm trying
to remember
the last time

20:52.051 --> 20:56.087
Something
that I said mattered
this much.

20:57.322 --> 21:01.359
I could send
those men to
jail, couldn't I?

21:02.928 --> 21:05.062
I don't think so.

21:05.230 --> 21:07.865
You think
the system's
that corrupt?

21:07.867 --> 21:11.469
That the eyewitness
testimony of an
upstanding member

21:11.471 --> 21:14.505
Of this community
wouldn't be enough
to indict them?

21:14.507 --> 21:16.507
Well, maybe
someone else's.

21:16.608 --> 21:18.643
Just not yours.

21:18.944 --> 21:21.746
What's wrong
with my testimony?

21:21.880 --> 21:23.381
You ever lied before?

21:23.383 --> 21:28.519
Yes. Of course.
Who hasn't?

21:28.521 --> 21:30.388
White lies.

21:30.689 --> 21:34.392
White lies, huh?
What did you do?

21:34.394 --> 21:36.594
Someone once make
the wrong change
in your favor

21:36.596 --> 21:37.628
And you didn't
correct 'em?

21:37.630 --> 21:40.931
You tell your
girlfriend you like her
hairdo when you didn't?

21:40.933 --> 21:42.099
Are you
insulting me?

21:42.101 --> 21:45.436
You made a left turn
onto slocum?

21:46.004 --> 21:47.271
(clicks tongue)
uh, that's right.

21:47.273 --> 21:49.774
With the light
or after the light
had changed?

21:49.776 --> 21:51.008
With the light.

21:51.010 --> 21:53.978
There's no traffic
light on that corner.

21:53.980 --> 21:54.979
It's a stop sign.

21:54.981 --> 21:56.914
Yes, well, under
the circumstances,

21:56.916 --> 21:57.815
A person
could forget that.

21:57.817 --> 22:00.117
Well, how'd you
happen to remember
the license plate,

22:00.119 --> 22:01.285
Mrs. Masters?
I mean, you had to make

22:01.287 --> 22:04.722
Visual note of that
before you saw
anything unusual.

22:04.724 --> 22:06.457
I just...

22:06.459 --> 22:07.692
It stuck in my mind.

22:07.694 --> 22:12.163
Uh, 2-8-9, because...
That was my
street address

22:12.165 --> 22:15.166
When I was a child...
2-8-9 cedar avenue.

22:15.168 --> 22:18.803
They can check that,
so it better be true.

22:18.805 --> 22:20.404
Is it true?

22:20.406 --> 22:21.439
No.

22:21.441 --> 22:24.809
So I... I...
Instead I could say...

22:24.811 --> 22:27.378
Well, what should I say?

22:27.380 --> 22:29.914
You seem real
flustered, ma'am.

22:30.115 --> 22:31.082
Are you flustered?

22:31.084 --> 22:31.982
I...
You saw a man...

22:31.984 --> 22:34.752
Bound and gagged
and thrown from
the back of a truck.

22:34.754 --> 22:36.887
I mean,
what did you do?

22:36.889 --> 22:39.056
Did you stop
the car and get out?

22:39.058 --> 22:41.726
No.
You just drove off?

22:41.728 --> 22:45.162
Yes.
Ah, to a police station,
I'm assuming.

22:45.164 --> 22:45.663
No.

22:45.665 --> 22:47.798
You saw someone
commit a crime,

22:47.800 --> 22:49.667
A despicable act,
and you didn't drive

22:49.669 --> 22:51.969
Straight to the
authorities to report it?

22:51.971 --> 22:53.637
Well, I am
doing that now.

22:53.639 --> 22:55.072
I am... I am here now.

22:55.074 --> 22:57.675
The defense will eat you
for lunch, mrs. Masters,

22:57.677 --> 22:59.643
And pick you
out their teeth.

22:59.645 --> 23:01.412
You'll do us more
harm than good.

23:01.414 --> 23:02.046
It ain't worth it.

23:02.048 --> 23:04.815
Well, then, why
did that lawyer,
mr. Gabler, ask me?

23:04.817 --> 23:06.384
Because he doesn't
know you.

23:06.386 --> 23:06.917
Oh, and you do?

23:06.919 --> 23:10.388
So I'm not a good liar,
as if that is something
to be ashamed of.

23:10.390 --> 23:15.292
So I don't have
a criminal record
like some people.

23:15.294 --> 23:18.462
(telephone ringing
in distance)

23:18.464 --> 23:22.366
You know, when I was,
uh, 17,

23:22.368 --> 23:24.335
I threw a brick through
a plate glass window

23:24.337 --> 23:27.371
Of a service station
and stole a set of tires,

23:27.373 --> 23:29.640
Just 'cause they was
fine and I wanted 'em.

23:29.642 --> 23:32.910
Now, it was stupid.
You know, I was a stupid kid,

23:32.912 --> 23:37.681
But I wanted something
I couldn't get any other
way than by taking it.

23:37.683 --> 23:41.051
Now I don't want
things that don't belong
to me anymore,

23:41.053 --> 23:42.420
But the things that do,

23:42.422 --> 23:47.158
The things that I'm
entitled to that someone
says I can't have...

23:47.160 --> 23:50.394
Oh, I'm gon' get them
anyway I can.

23:50.929 --> 23:53.264
You came to me.

23:53.266 --> 23:54.098
You asked for my help,

23:54.100 --> 23:57.234
And I am here and I am
willing to give it to you.

23:57.236 --> 23:59.804
And now
you don't want it?

23:59.806 --> 24:01.472
Now it's not...

24:01.474 --> 24:04.241
It's not good
enough for you?

24:04.243 --> 24:06.610
I'm not good
enough for you?

24:10.081 --> 24:13.017
You're a careful woman,
mrs. Masters.

24:13.019 --> 24:15.753
And I'm guessing you...
You came to a complete stop

24:15.755 --> 24:17.855
At that stop sign,
you looked both ways,

24:17.857 --> 24:20.357
You signaled,
you drove on,

24:20.359 --> 24:23.928
Hell, you didn't
get out of the car.

24:24.362 --> 24:29.633
Now we need
a different kind of person
on that witness stand.

24:30.802 --> 24:34.104
Now it was real good
of you to wanna help,

24:34.106 --> 24:37.208
And we thank you
kindly for your offer,

24:37.210 --> 24:40.110
But we'll make do
without it.

24:40.112 --> 24:43.147
You just go on
home, ma'am.

25:03.969 --> 25:06.103
(sniffles)
I'm embarrassed.

25:06.105 --> 25:07.738
Don't be.

25:08.573 --> 25:11.075
You were both
very patient.

25:11.077 --> 25:15.179
I'm sorry that
I made it so difficult.

25:16.648 --> 25:18.682
I'm doing the
right thing, aren't I,

25:18.684 --> 25:21.552
By trying
to fix myself?

25:21.554 --> 25:23.220
I know it's unfair
of me to ask you,

25:23.222 --> 25:25.890
Because what are
you supposed to say?

25:26.558 --> 25:28.158
Thank you.

25:28.793 --> 25:31.996
I think that
we can help you.

25:31.998 --> 25:35.766
We're going to
try our very best.

25:35.768 --> 25:39.470
I wanna believe you. I...

25:40.772 --> 25:42.907
I have trouble
trusting people.

25:42.909 --> 25:44.909
Of course you do.

25:44.911 --> 25:50.414
People have let you down,
taken advantage of you.

25:50.416 --> 25:53.050
People close to you.

25:59.224 --> 26:03.027
Maybe even the person
closest to you.

26:03.795 --> 26:05.896
My brother, you mean?

26:05.898 --> 26:09.233
What would you say
to him if you could?

26:09.235 --> 26:13.637
Well, we still talk.
Not about what happened.

26:13.639 --> 26:17.308
But he lives
in chesterfield.

26:17.809 --> 26:19.843
He just got divorced...

26:19.845 --> 26:20.644
Again.

26:20.646 --> 26:22.913
Again, again,
it's third time.

26:22.915 --> 26:23.614
What would you...

26:23.616 --> 26:26.050
What would you have
wanted to say to him

26:26.052 --> 26:27.184
When you were
that little girl,

26:27.186 --> 26:31.255
But you couldn't because
you were too afraid?

26:31.257 --> 26:33.324
Like what?
Like...

26:33.892 --> 26:35.893
"stop."

26:35.895 --> 26:38.462
Did you ever
tell him to stop?

26:38.964 --> 26:43.601
I don't know.
I... I must have, right?

26:43.603 --> 26:44.535
Well, what
if you were...

26:44.537 --> 26:49.773
What if you were
to say it now?
Out loud?

26:49.775 --> 26:55.179
Tell him now
but say it as your
12-year-old self.

26:57.949 --> 26:59.416
Stop.

27:01.019 --> 27:02.720
Like that?

27:04.122 --> 27:07.491
Woman: (over television)
<i>certainly not acting...</i>

27:07.959 --> 27:08.459
Adorable.

27:08.461 --> 27:10.260
He just tucked himself
right under my arm.

27:10.262 --> 27:12.396
(inhales deeply,
exhales sharply)

27:12.398 --> 27:14.365
I can tell he was
dropping off, so I
skipped ahead a bit.

27:14.367 --> 27:17.501
Oh, johnny will
never let you
get away with that.

27:17.503 --> 27:18.636
Did he make
you go back?

27:18.638 --> 27:22.673
And then insisted
on turning the rest of
the pages himself.

27:22.675 --> 27:23.607
(laughs)

27:23.609 --> 27:25.576
Did bill want a boy?

27:25.744 --> 27:28.545
Um... Just a healthy
baby, he said.

27:28.547 --> 27:31.248
Frank says that, too,
but I know he wants one.

27:31.250 --> 27:32.950
The giveaway is when
you see your husband

27:32.952 --> 27:34.985
With your
friends' kids, isn't it?

27:34.987 --> 27:37.488
How he jokes with the boys,
but doesn't quite know

27:37.490 --> 27:38.989
What to say to the girls?

27:38.991 --> 27:40.057
Yes, I suppose.

27:40.059 --> 27:42.593
I'm glad they're going
together tonight.

27:42.595 --> 27:43.427
It was important to frank

27:43.429 --> 27:45.929
That he introduce
bill to his crowd.

27:45.931 --> 27:50.234
Well, he may find that
his brother can be a little
on the taciturn side.

27:50.236 --> 27:51.001
Oh, that's
perfectly okay.

27:51.003 --> 27:55.039
Really, no one
there expects him
to say a thing.

27:56.307 --> 27:58.308
Why would that be?

27:58.610 --> 27:59.877
Man: Rarely have we
seen a person fail

27:59.879 --> 28:02.479
Who has thoroughly
followed our path.

28:02.481 --> 28:04.381
Those who do not
recover are people

28:04.383 --> 28:06.350
Who are not completely
willing to give...

28:06.352 --> 28:09.420
(lowered voice)
you said we were meeting
friends of yours.

28:09.422 --> 28:10.854
(lowered voice)
and here they are...

28:10.856 --> 28:16.660
Total strangers,
most of whom know me better
than I know myself.

28:16.662 --> 28:18.696
(inhales sharply)
it's my birthday, bill.

28:18.698 --> 28:20.998
I want you here
to celebrate it.

28:21.000 --> 28:22.499
It's your birthday in March.

28:22.501 --> 28:23.734
My sober birthday.

28:23.736 --> 28:27.905
They're gonna give me a chip
and let me tell my story.

28:28.106 --> 28:29.873
I want you to hear it.

28:29.875 --> 28:31.175
Man:
...But many of them
do recover.

28:31.177 --> 28:33.644
They have the
capacity to be honest.

28:33.646 --> 28:34.511
(knock on door)

28:34.513 --> 28:37.414
You must be lester.
Come on in.

28:37.416 --> 28:39.750
It's very nice
to meet you, miss...

28:39.752 --> 28:40.651
Kitty.

28:40.653 --> 28:43.153
Miss kitty,
like on  <i>gunsmoke.</i>

28:43.155 --> 28:47.124
The proprietress
of the long branch saloon
in dodge city?

28:47.126 --> 28:48.292
Although everyone
knew miss kitty

28:48.294 --> 28:52.062
Wasn't really
a barkeep as much as
she was a prost...

28:52.664 --> 28:54.998
It's okay.
You just relax.

28:55.000 --> 28:56.333
We're gonna have
a good time tonight.

28:56.335 --> 29:00.237
Nothing is going
to happen that you don't
want to happen.

29:00.239 --> 29:03.107
What if I don't want
anything to happen?

29:03.109 --> 29:04.908
Now why would
you say that?

29:04.910 --> 29:06.710
Don't you think
I'm pretty?

29:06.712 --> 29:09.680
Pretty? Oh, yeah.
Yes, you're very pretty.

29:09.682 --> 29:11.448
My sister has
your hair color.

29:11.450 --> 29:14.251
Okay, see, now
that's not a great road
to go down, lester.

29:14.253 --> 29:18.555
Why don't we just
try having a normal
conversation?

29:18.557 --> 29:21.692
Maybe we could
start by you telling me
what you like?

29:21.694 --> 29:23.627
The french new wave.

29:23.629 --> 29:24.895
About me.

29:24.897 --> 29:28.499
Um, that's a very
lovely blouse.

29:28.501 --> 29:32.803
Oh, thank you.
Well, it's very silky.

29:32.805 --> 29:34.905
Do you wanna feel
how silky it is?

29:34.907 --> 29:35.672
I can tell from here.

29:35.674 --> 29:38.809
To be honest,
it's a little
constricting,

29:38.811 --> 29:41.478
A little tight
around the bust area.

29:41.480 --> 29:42.146
(exhales deeply)

29:42.148 --> 29:46.550
Wow, um, I should
tell you my heart's
beating very fast.

29:46.552 --> 29:48.652
Oh, may I take that
as a compliment?

29:48.654 --> 29:51.922
I think it's paroxysmal
supraventricular tachycardia.

29:51.924 --> 29:55.492
It's what killed my father.
Very recently.

29:55.494 --> 29:56.593
I'm so sorry.

29:56.595 --> 30:02.065
Now, lester,
what's the worst thing
that could happen here?

30:02.067 --> 30:03.534
I could drop dead.

30:03.536 --> 30:06.770
Well, let's pretend
like I'm a doctor.

30:06.772 --> 30:08.639
A cardiologist?

30:08.706 --> 30:11.308
Okay, a cardiologist.

30:11.310 --> 30:14.144
You'd trust
a cardiologist,
wouldn't you?

30:14.146 --> 30:15.913
Depends on
where he went to
medical school.

30:15.915 --> 30:20.484
(chuckles) well, I went
to the best medical school
in the world.

30:20.486 --> 30:23.086
And I studied more things
than just the heart.

30:23.088 --> 30:26.223
But ultimately,
you'd have to
pick a specialty.

30:26.225 --> 30:28.859
Oh, it was
very difficult.

30:28.861 --> 30:31.061
Because it turns out...

30:31.063 --> 30:32.729
I'm good at everything.

30:32.731 --> 30:36.099
Patients can lie down
on my exam table

30:36.101 --> 30:39.736
And I can diagnose
their problems.

30:39.904 --> 30:44.374
And I use my magic
touch to heal them.

30:45.009 --> 30:47.277
Doesn't that
make medical school
superfluous?

30:47.279 --> 30:50.581
I instinctively know
where to press,

30:50.583 --> 30:55.085
Where to squeeze,
where to stroke,

30:55.087 --> 30:56.086
And where to lick.

30:56.088 --> 30:59.556
Won't you let me
show you, lester,

30:59.558 --> 31:03.126
How I can bring
men back to life?

31:03.128 --> 31:06.964
(moaning)

31:09.434 --> 31:12.069
(applause)

31:12.071 --> 31:17.007
(cheers and applause)

31:17.009 --> 31:19.810
Congratulations, frank.
Thank you.

31:20.278 --> 31:22.546
(whispers)
thanks.

31:24.315 --> 31:28.252
(normal voice)
hi. I'm frank,
and I'm an alcoholic.

31:28.254 --> 31:30.020
All: Hi, frank.

31:30.022 --> 31:33.190
I'm very grateful
to be here tonight.

31:35.326 --> 31:37.895
(coin clinks)

31:43.635 --> 31:45.502
(laughter)

31:45.504 --> 31:48.605
Been practicing
that move since I was 8.

31:48.607 --> 31:52.809
Disappearing acts
have always
been my specialty.

31:52.811 --> 31:56.413
Not just coins or cards.

31:56.415 --> 31:58.682
I had this trick
when I was a kid,

31:58.684 --> 32:01.652
I could make
myself disappear,

32:01.654 --> 32:04.554
I could sense trouble
coming with just...

32:04.556 --> 32:07.858
...From the way my dad
came through the door.

32:07.860 --> 32:11.128
Shazam! I was out the door
and down the street

32:11.130 --> 32:15.499
Telling
mrs. Magavern jokes,

32:15.501 --> 32:18.869
Helping water
her tomato plants
so she'd invite me

32:18.871 --> 32:20.604
To have supper
with her family

32:20.606 --> 32:24.474
Before anyone
at my house had
even missed me.

32:25.009 --> 32:28.278
After a while,
I decided to up the ante.

32:28.280 --> 32:32.749
You know,
teach myself
to disappear

32:32.751 --> 32:33.884
Without ever
going anywhere.

32:33.886 --> 32:36.887
I could be sitting
at the dinner table
and my dad

32:36.889 --> 32:42.192
Would be telling
me what he thought
about me...

32:42.194 --> 32:43.393
(laughs)

32:43.395 --> 32:48.932
Taking tap dancing lessons
or any extra helpings.

32:48.934 --> 32:51.268
Getting a "b" in biology.

32:51.270 --> 32:52.836
"your brother
never got a 'b'."

32:52.838 --> 32:56.740
And, uh, presto,
I was gone.

32:57.575 --> 33:00.510
Some tricks get easier
the more you practice.

33:00.512 --> 33:05.349
This one
got harder, took more
and more effort, uh,

33:05.351 --> 33:07.451
To make it look simple.

33:07.453 --> 33:12.389
After a while, I needed
a fearless assistant

33:12.391 --> 33:14.358
To help me pull it off.

33:14.726 --> 33:16.493
And I found

33:16.495 --> 33:18.428
Lots of them...

33:20.031 --> 33:21.331
Brandy.

33:21.333 --> 33:23.133
Sherry.

33:23.267 --> 33:25.068
Scotch.

33:25.570 --> 33:27.337
Bourbon...

33:28.973 --> 33:30.374
Gin.

33:30.376 --> 33:34.211
I always thought
I was just born

33:34.213 --> 33:36.380
With this natural gift.

33:36.382 --> 33:38.615
It wasn't until
I quit drinking,

33:38.617 --> 33:44.021
Until my sobriety
allowed me this, uh...

33:47.959 --> 33:49.993
Magnificent

33:50.962 --> 33:54.765
Clarity that
I realized...

33:56.000 --> 33:59.136
I'd had a teacher
all along.

33:59.704 --> 34:01.171
My dad...

34:01.173 --> 34:03.440
The greatest magician
of all time.

34:03.442 --> 34:07.511
He could make
things vanish.
Like that.

34:07.645 --> 34:10.747
His approval...
(blows air)

34:11.015 --> 34:13.517
My mother's smile...

34:14.052 --> 34:15.285
The fun of a baseball game

34:15.287 --> 34:16.319
You'd been waiting for
all summer.

34:16.321 --> 34:18.255
I'd do one thing
to disappoint him,

34:18.257 --> 34:20.657
Blow a line
at the christmas
pageant,

34:20.659 --> 34:22.959
Strike out
with the bases loaded,
and, uh,

34:22.961 --> 34:27.064
And, uh, afterwards,
he wouldn't let me
get in the car.

34:27.066 --> 34:28.598
He'd make me walk home,

34:28.600 --> 34:31.234
Once in, uh,
once in a heat wave,

34:31.236 --> 34:34.171
Once in a snowstorm.

34:35.073 --> 34:38.442
I watch his car
pull away,

34:38.776 --> 34:42.712
I'd see him
get smaller and smaller

34:42.714 --> 34:46.683
As he drove into
the distance until...

34:47.051 --> 34:49.953
Poof. He was gone.

34:52.423 --> 34:57.227
Without saying a word,
just by his example,

34:57.295 --> 35:01.598
He taught
both of his boys
how to vanish.

35:02.366 --> 35:04.634
Didn't he, bill?

35:09.040 --> 35:10.440
(sighs)

35:10.442 --> 35:12.809
Ta-da. (chuckles)

35:17.682 --> 35:19.850
I'm not sure
what you mean.

35:19.852 --> 35:21.251
"what else?"

35:21.253 --> 35:22.652
That was good.

35:22.654 --> 35:24.254
That finding your
voice exercise,

35:24.256 --> 35:25.655
I think that
really helped.

35:25.657 --> 35:28.892
So I was hoping you had
another suggestion.

35:28.894 --> 35:32.696
I see.
So you're done
with that part?

35:33.197 --> 35:35.065
Well, I imagined
what I would've liked

35:35.067 --> 35:35.966
To have said
to my brother.

35:35.968 --> 35:40.303
You said to do that.
I did it. So what do
I do now?

35:41.472 --> 35:45.542
You seem very intent
on moving through
this process

35:45.544 --> 35:47.244
As quickly as possible,
barbara.

35:47.246 --> 35:48.512
Well, do you blame me
for that?

35:48.514 --> 35:51.748
For wanting
a little piece of mind?

35:51.750 --> 35:53.717
That's why I'm here,
after all.

35:53.719 --> 35:57.053
You're asking
"if I blame you."

35:57.255 --> 36:01.558
I meant, I know that
you don't blame,
it's a...

36:01.560 --> 36:02.692
It's a figure of speech.

36:02.694 --> 36:06.029
It's familiar to you,
though, isn't it?

36:06.031 --> 36:07.597
To feel blamed?

36:08.266 --> 36:10.333
Judged?
Misunderstood?

36:10.335 --> 36:12.936
You felt that from
your mother, you said.

36:12.938 --> 36:15.272
And your, um...
(clicks tongue)

36:15.640 --> 36:17.774
I'm sorry,
your fiance?

36:19.911 --> 36:22.779
Gil.
Yes. Who else?

36:24.849 --> 36:28.485
Mmm. No one, really.

36:33.291 --> 36:34.624
Have you ever

36:34.626 --> 36:37.294
Withheld some truth
about yourself

36:37.296 --> 36:40.630
Because you feared
someone's judgement?

36:43.134 --> 36:45.602
There, there was someone

36:46.103 --> 36:46.836
That I was close to,

36:46.838 --> 36:49.039
My boss, actually.
She died a few years back.

36:49.041 --> 36:53.143
I was afraid of
her finding out something
that I'd done,

36:53.145 --> 36:56.413
Which, she did,
by accident.

37:01.352 --> 37:04.321
I was, I was seeing
a married man.

37:04.323 --> 37:07.123
And how did your friend
react to that?

37:07.125 --> 37:08.792
She,

37:08.794 --> 37:11.027
Let me have it.

37:11.029 --> 37:11.895
But the situation was,

37:11.897 --> 37:16.967
It wasn't entirely
as she understood it
to be.

37:16.969 --> 37:21.538
Lillian, uh,
lillian saw things
in black and white

37:21.540 --> 37:23.039
And this relationship...

37:23.041 --> 37:26.776
There was a lot of
grey area in,
in that relationship.

37:26.778 --> 37:31.481
So she judged you more
harshly than you felt
you deserved.

37:31.782 --> 37:32.182
Yes.

37:32.184 --> 37:34.284
And yet you say,
you anticipated
her judgement.

37:34.286 --> 37:39.556
So clearly you had
a sense of what her
objections would be.

37:39.558 --> 37:40.957
Well...

37:40.959 --> 37:43.994
Of course.
Yeah, I,
he was married.

37:43.996 --> 37:46.630
And that bothered
your friend?

37:47.498 --> 37:49.499
And not you?

37:50.201 --> 37:53.536
I never saw myself
as a threat to
the man's wife.

37:53.538 --> 37:57.207
Because?
Because I never
wanted to marry him.

37:57.209 --> 37:59.943
So that was the
only way you posed
a threat if, uh,

37:59.945 --> 38:03.280
You wanted this woman's
husband for yourself?

38:03.347 --> 38:04.748
Yes.

38:09.754 --> 38:11.988
So why did it end?

38:13.891 --> 38:14.391
I'm sorry?

38:14.393 --> 38:17.694
Well, if you weren't
concerned about
this man's wife,

38:17.696 --> 38:21.097
What caused the
relationship to end?

38:26.337 --> 38:27.737
Gil.

38:29.073 --> 38:30.840
I met gil.

38:35.913 --> 38:38.148
Leona'd take ages
to get ready.

38:38.150 --> 38:40.684
So frank and I'd
wind up sitting
in the living room

38:40.686 --> 38:42.018
Waiting for her
to make an entrance,

38:42.020 --> 38:45.021
And in the meantime,
he'd be trying to
make me laugh,

38:45.023 --> 38:46.790
Doing all these
crazy routines,

38:46.792 --> 38:48.958
Most of which he just
stole off the tv.

38:48.960 --> 38:51.461
One day he knocked
on the door and
my sister answered it,

38:51.463 --> 38:55.832
All smiles
and batted eyelashes,
"oh, francis."

38:55.834 --> 38:58.601
And he said,
"actually, leona,

38:58.603 --> 39:00.570
"I'm here for pauline."

39:00.572 --> 39:02.272
(chuckles)

39:03.040 --> 39:06.176
So how about you
and bill?

39:06.377 --> 39:08.378
Oh, um, uh,

39:08.380 --> 39:11.781
I was working
as a medical secretary.

39:13.851 --> 39:15.552
Uh-huh...

39:16.153 --> 39:19.222
Uh, we, we didn't get
married right away,

39:19.224 --> 39:23.727
But only because
he was so busy
with his practice.

39:23.861 --> 39:28.031
(sighs)
uh, we fell in love
very quickly.

39:28.033 --> 39:31.234
He was, um,
he was so charming.

39:31.236 --> 39:35.672
I know.
The masters charm.
(laughs)

39:35.740 --> 39:39.175
I, for one,
was blinded by it.

39:39.443 --> 39:40.777
It's probably
what prevented me

39:40.779 --> 39:43.246
From seeing the signs
for so long.

39:43.248 --> 39:46.116
Signs of...
Frank's drinking?

39:46.118 --> 39:48.051
It's embarrassing
what I missed, really.

39:48.053 --> 39:52.455
Things I just chalked up
to his having
a big personality.

39:52.457 --> 39:56.826
But, god,
the mood swings,

39:57.461 --> 39:58.995
The impulsivity...

39:58.997 --> 40:04.567
A new car, a new house,
a new medical partnership.

40:05.102 --> 40:07.470
He got sloppy
toward the end, though,

40:07.472 --> 40:10.340
Couldn't keep
his story straight,

40:10.342 --> 40:11.975
The lies...

40:12.943 --> 40:15.578
Where he'd been
all night,

40:15.580 --> 40:17.580
Why he couldn't
make love,

40:18.215 --> 40:22.285
And then, of course,
there was the visit to the
er where he almost died.

40:22.287 --> 40:26.156
And I said,
"it's the bottle
or me.

40:26.590 --> 40:28.124
"pick."

40:28.926 --> 40:32.829
You really think
you would've
walked away?

40:35.399 --> 40:38.635
You would've done
the same thing in
my position, libby.

40:39.170 --> 40:43.239
No one expected me
to draw the line,
honestly,

40:43.241 --> 40:47.277
I think most people
considered me
as a bit of a ninny.

40:47.279 --> 40:49.579
I'm sure
that's not true.
I was!

40:49.581 --> 40:53.550
You wouldn't
recognize the person
I was before.

40:53.552 --> 40:56.386
I was the
go-along gal,

40:56.720 --> 40:59.022
The laugh you could
always count on.

40:59.024 --> 41:04.093
I didn't wanna make waves,
didn't ever wanna
upset anyone.

41:04.929 --> 41:07.096
Mmm, I tell ya,
it felt good to do
something

41:07.098 --> 41:10.066
No one thought
I was capable of.

41:11.702 --> 41:15.438
He thought
I saved his life,
but really,

41:16.507 --> 41:19.008
I was saving my own.

41:23.848 --> 41:25.181
(door closes)

41:25.183 --> 41:28.718
So, dr. Masters does
not want to go

41:28.720 --> 41:30.753
Up in size today.

41:30.755 --> 41:33.723
We're just going to see
if the insertion itself

41:33.725 --> 41:34.457
Is less painful,

41:34.459 --> 41:39.162
And if you can
tolerate the same
dilation for longer.

41:39.164 --> 41:41.531
So how was
the soreness after?

41:41.533 --> 41:45.235
I went home
and took a warm bath
like you said.

41:45.237 --> 41:47.937
And you took
the pain pill?

41:48.005 --> 41:50.240
I followed all
your instructions.

41:50.242 --> 41:52.876
Good.
That's good.

41:54.211 --> 41:56.379
Including talking to paul.

41:57.848 --> 42:00.850
I, saying those
things to him.

42:00.852 --> 42:05.488
Wait, uh, do you mean
you spoke to him
in your head?

42:05.956 --> 42:07.624
Or in person?

42:07.858 --> 42:09.526
We met.

42:10.761 --> 42:12.929
No, I meant...

42:12.931 --> 42:15.365
The suggestion
was that you,
you think about

42:15.367 --> 42:18.935
What you would have liked
to have said back then.

42:18.937 --> 42:20.870
You, you said
to talk to him, so...

42:20.872 --> 42:24.941
No, the idea was
to imagine the
conversation.

42:24.943 --> 42:26.309
Well, I did not
have to imagine one

42:26.311 --> 42:30.847
Because he lives
20 miles away,
and we met for dinner

42:30.849 --> 42:33.850
Like we do
sometimes anyway.

42:35.019 --> 42:36.486
And?

42:37.955 --> 42:41.157
"remember when?"
I said...

42:42.860 --> 42:46.696
"do you remember
that time when we..."

42:49.033 --> 42:51.868
I could've said,
"went sledding on
bergen hill."

42:51.870 --> 42:53.937
For all it upset him.

42:53.939 --> 42:56.506
Did he deny it?
No.

42:56.574 --> 42:58.041
No.

42:58.976 --> 43:00.877
Not at all.

43:01.312 --> 43:04.414
But he remembered
it different.

43:06.083 --> 43:08.585
He said that
it was my idea.

43:10.621 --> 43:12.288
That's absurd, barb.

43:12.290 --> 43:14.257
Of course he's
going to say that.

43:14.259 --> 43:17.226
No, no, no, it,
no, it, it wasn't
like that.

43:17.228 --> 43:20.496
He didn't accuse me.
He just...

43:21.932 --> 43:24.067
He reminded me.

43:26.036 --> 43:29.539
I forgot that there

43:29.541 --> 43:31.774
Were these triplets
that moved in

43:31.776 --> 43:32.942
Across the street from us
that summer.

43:32.944 --> 43:37.647
And every morning
he wanted to go off
with them.

43:38.983 --> 43:42.118
And I wanted him
to stay home,

43:42.753 --> 43:44.687
Play with me.

43:45.222 --> 43:47.190
Just with me.

43:48.626 --> 43:50.259
And so...

43:50.594 --> 43:56.065
I invented this game
to keep him interested.

43:59.303 --> 44:01.871
(whispers)
and it worked.

44:02.039 --> 44:04.774
You don't know that
that's what happened.

44:04.776 --> 44:07.176
It makes sense,
virginia.

44:07.178 --> 44:11.214
If he had violated me,
how could we be so close?

44:13.050 --> 44:14.651
How could I want
to see him be happy?

44:14.653 --> 44:16.719
Barb, these things
are complicated.

44:16.721 --> 44:20.657
I'm just learning myself
how complicated.

44:20.659 --> 44:23.192
I want to remember
this is his fault

44:23.194 --> 44:27.530
Because I wanna be
absolved of responsibility

44:27.532 --> 44:30.433
For how my life
has turned out.

44:31.201 --> 44:33.069
Being alone.

44:33.237 --> 44:34.971
For not being able
to love someone

44:34.973 --> 44:38.741
In a way that is not
shameful and dirty.

44:39.510 --> 44:43.613
(whispers)
what if it's my fault,
virginia?

44:43.881 --> 44:46.916
What if I did this
to myself?

44:48.686 --> 44:50.820
(inhales deeply)

44:53.057 --> 44:53.990
Lester: You know in
sunset boulevard

44:53.992 --> 44:56.059
How william holden's dead
floating in the pool

44:56.061 --> 44:59.028
And telling the story
at the same time?

44:59.030 --> 45:01.030
That was me.
Splayed on the bed,

45:01.032 --> 45:03.332
Hovering above it all
at the same time,

45:03.334 --> 45:04.133
Victim and narrator.

45:04.135 --> 45:05.968
Come on, now.
Isn't that a little
overstated?

45:05.970 --> 45:10.707
I'm telling you,
I was completely
disassociated from my body.

45:10.709 --> 45:13.843
In my head,
looking down at
myself thinking,

45:13.845 --> 45:17.814
"what's going on
down there?
What is she doing?

45:17.816 --> 45:19.048
"where's she
touching me?

45:19.050 --> 45:21.484
"has this woman ever
pulled taffy for a living?"

45:21.486 --> 45:22.418
What was she
doing exactly?

45:22.420 --> 45:25.688
Was it all manual
stimulation or oral
as well?

45:25.690 --> 45:27.957
Why are you writing
any of this down?

45:27.959 --> 45:30.393
Nothing happened,
all right?

45:30.395 --> 45:31.594
I flopped. Literally.

45:31.596 --> 45:34.831
Even if you didn't
achieve an erection,
lester,

45:34.833 --> 45:36.199
It's still of
clinical value.

45:36.201 --> 45:38.134
You know, it allows us
to rule out techniques

45:38.136 --> 45:40.136
That weren't effective
this time but next time

45:40.138 --> 45:42.505
You'll be open to
other techniques.
Oh, no, no, no.

45:42.507 --> 45:44.741
There's not gonna be
a next time.
Lester.

45:44.743 --> 45:47.210
Can't you find
another guy
in my situation

45:47.212 --> 45:50.446
To be your guinea pig?
You say we're
everywhere, right?

45:50.448 --> 45:54.217
I want you
to stay with this,
lester.

45:54.219 --> 45:55.485
I can't.

45:55.487 --> 45:58.121
The single variable thing
may work for the study

45:58.123 --> 45:59.856
But not for me.

45:59.858 --> 46:03.226
For me, I need
just two people

46:03.228 --> 46:05.128
Figuring it out together.

46:05.496 --> 46:08.097
Not an expert
and a novice.

46:08.099 --> 46:11.100
Just a man and a woman
equally matched

46:11.102 --> 46:12.168
Even if they both happen
to be inept.

46:12.170 --> 46:15.772
That'd be tantamount
to the blind leading
the blind.

46:15.774 --> 46:17.774
Not if they're
already a couple.

46:17.776 --> 46:19.609
If they know
each other's bodies,

46:19.611 --> 46:21.911
Have feelings
for each other.

46:22.212 --> 46:26.215
So many subjects
have come through
your door.

46:26.316 --> 46:28.417
Don't you know a couple
like that?

46:31.522 --> 46:33.523
(soft music playing)

46:34.158 --> 46:35.558
Gini.

46:40.764 --> 46:41.998
Lib.

46:42.000 --> 46:45.401
What are you
doing here?
Oh, well, I'm...

46:45.403 --> 46:47.770
Can I get a refill,
please?

46:47.772 --> 46:49.038
May I join you
for a second?

46:49.040 --> 46:52.008
Oh, I'm sorry, lib,
I really should
head back upstairs.

46:52.010 --> 46:55.745
I won't take up
much of your time,
okay, just...

46:55.747 --> 46:58.181
Well, I'm stalling,
really.

46:58.183 --> 47:01.284
I'm trying to
screw up my courage.

47:01.518 --> 47:03.653
Uh, to do what?

47:04.888 --> 47:07.356
Can I tell you
after I know
how it turns out?

47:07.358 --> 47:10.860
In case
I chicken out?
Of course.

47:11.161 --> 47:13.529
Now, I really
should get going.

47:13.531 --> 47:15.064
Let's just say that
I could use some of

47:15.066 --> 47:18.034
What you have
in abundance...

47:18.202 --> 47:19.669
Nerve.

47:19.903 --> 47:22.805
Really, gin, I keep
thinking about when you
first started

47:22.807 --> 47:24.774
Working with bill
at maternity.
Hmm.

47:24.776 --> 47:28.711
How you just,
walked into his office
without any experience

47:28.713 --> 47:33.015
And yet you demanded
to be taken seriously.

47:33.917 --> 47:37.420
What made you think
that you could do that?
It was...

47:37.621 --> 47:40.022
(chuckles)
it was not courage,

47:40.024 --> 47:42.859
If that's what
you're thinking.

47:44.461 --> 47:46.095
What was it then?

47:46.964 --> 47:49.999
False sense
of entitlement, maybe?

47:50.001 --> 47:52.101
Recklessness?

47:52.469 --> 47:53.870
Stupidity?

47:53.872 --> 47:56.606
Come on.
Libby, I...

47:56.840 --> 47:58.908
I don't read instructions,
I just

47:58.910 --> 48:01.711
Take things out of
the box and I plug them in.

48:01.713 --> 48:02.712
To hell with
consequences.

48:02.714 --> 48:06.616
To hell with
the blown fuses.
(chuckles)

48:06.950 --> 48:11.020
The fingers almost lost
in the spinning blade.

48:12.522 --> 48:14.390
That's ridiculous.

48:15.192 --> 48:17.393
I look at you and...

48:17.395 --> 48:21.030
You're one of the bravest
people that I know.

48:21.832 --> 48:24.166
You just see
what you want
and you,

48:24.168 --> 48:27.870
You go and get it.
Don't do that, please.

48:28.872 --> 48:30.806
I mean it.
Don't, uh,

48:30.808 --> 48:35.177
Don't hold
me up as an example
of anything.

48:35.179 --> 48:39.181
Now, I really need
to get upstairs.
We have patients.

48:39.183 --> 48:40.883
Of course, you go.

48:47.124 --> 48:48.424
Uh, we have your
wife scheduled

48:48.426 --> 48:50.159
For a capping
this afternoon.

48:50.161 --> 48:51.193
Did I get the
time wrong?

48:51.195 --> 48:55.097
She'll be here.
Uh, I was hoping to have
a private word with bill.

48:55.099 --> 48:59.568
Oh, dr. Masters,
dr. Mason is here
to see ya.

48:59.570 --> 49:01.904
I'm sorry,
did you say "mason?"
yeah, that's right.

49:01.906 --> 49:04.040
In my office,
please, frank.

49:04.042 --> 49:06.676
My name's not...
Dr. Masters: My office.

49:21.291 --> 49:24.260
Is there anything
you'd like to say to me
about last night, bill?

49:24.262 --> 49:25.695
You're hoping
for an apology?

49:25.697 --> 49:28.864
You don't think
your abrupt departure
calls for one?

49:28.866 --> 49:30.967
Oh, it seemed
an appropriate response

49:30.969 --> 49:32.368
To a bait-and-switch.

49:32.370 --> 49:36.005
You were hardly
introducing me to
some friends.

49:36.007 --> 49:40.309
I was reintroducing
myself, to you.

49:40.311 --> 49:42.845
I needed
their support.

49:42.847 --> 49:48.217
It's in rooms like that
I found the courage
to tell the truth.

49:49.453 --> 49:50.486
My truth.

49:50.488 --> 49:54.590
Well, which is it?
The truth or your truth?

49:54.592 --> 49:55.624
Maybe if you stayed
and listened...

49:55.626 --> 49:58.327
I already knew
the whole story.

49:59.763 --> 50:01.330
The sadistic father,

50:01.332 --> 50:04.300
Always teaching his son
a lesson in humiliation.

50:04.302 --> 50:08.204
The kid who left home
to become a doctor

50:08.206 --> 50:11.874
To make a career out
of saving lives,

50:12.175 --> 50:14.076
Having barely been able
to save his own.

50:14.078 --> 50:17.580
I knew it because
it's my story, francis.

50:18.115 --> 50:21.450
And maybe aa's allowed
you to appropriate
my experience

50:21.452 --> 50:23.953
As justification
for your overindulgence.

50:23.955 --> 50:26.188
What?
Or maybe you truly are
deluded, you know?

50:26.190 --> 50:28.657
All that alcohol
has played tricks
on your mind.

50:28.659 --> 50:31.394
Now just a minute...
I fumbled a 4th down

50:31.396 --> 50:33.129
33-yard pass
at the 8-yard line.

50:33.131 --> 50:35.564
That was me
he pulled out
of the car,

50:35.566 --> 50:39.735
Me he made walk home
in the rain,

50:39.803 --> 50:41.804
Me his tire splattered
with mud

50:41.806 --> 50:44.006
As he pulled out
of the parking lot,

50:44.008 --> 50:46.275
Me who knew
there was a beating
waiting for me

50:46.277 --> 50:47.977
When I got back home.

50:47.979 --> 50:51.213
And you were
in the backseat,
little brother,

50:51.215 --> 50:54.583
Watching me through
the rear window.

50:55.185 --> 50:57.019
You saw it
happen to me.

50:58.688 --> 51:00.122
What makes you think
the same thing

51:00.124 --> 51:01.390
Didn't happen to me
after you were gone?

51:01.392 --> 51:03.793
That I was
your replacement?

51:05.729 --> 51:10.066
Because if I thought
that was possible, I...

51:11.101 --> 51:14.537
I never would've
left you behind.

51:16.473 --> 51:19.842
No, you,
you were the apple
of his eye.

51:20.310 --> 51:22.178
He'd show you off
in front of company,

51:22.180 --> 51:25.748
Make you perform.
For christ's sake,
he gave you his name.

51:25.750 --> 51:27.850
What father skips over
his firstborn

51:27.852 --> 51:29.852
To give his second son
his name?

51:29.854 --> 51:32.421
A son of a bitch,
that's who.

51:32.423 --> 51:34.657
That's what he was

51:34.858 --> 51:36.592
To both of us.

51:37.794 --> 51:38.594
You tunneled
under the wall.

51:38.596 --> 51:40.496
I went over it.
We both escaped!

51:40.498 --> 51:42.631
Look, whatever
you need to believe
to keep yourself

51:42.633 --> 51:45.868
On the straight
and narrow.

51:47.070 --> 51:49.405
I'm healed, bill.

51:49.673 --> 51:52.174
That's what
the truth does.

51:52.176 --> 51:54.910
You just have to be
brave enough to face it.

51:54.912 --> 51:55.778
Oh, I see. I see.

51:55.780 --> 51:57.646
So the point of
dragging me
to that meeting

51:57.648 --> 52:02.485
Wasn't really to
share insights about
yourself, was it?

52:02.487 --> 52:06.589
Who did you really think
you were in that story,
bill?

52:06.591 --> 52:08.290
Me?

52:08.492 --> 52:10.025
Or him?

52:11.194 --> 52:12.461
Think about it.

52:12.463 --> 52:15.531
No, there's nothing,
there's nothing to
think about.

52:15.533 --> 52:17.032
He left you,

52:17.434 --> 52:19.568
And you left me.

52:22.239 --> 52:24.507
I don't blame you
for it.

52:25.475 --> 52:27.009
I did.

52:29.246 --> 52:31.680
But I understand now.

52:33.216 --> 52:35.451
And I forgive you.

52:44.561 --> 52:47.229
(indistinct conversations)

52:47.231 --> 52:50.065
(telephone ringing
in distance)

52:55.906 --> 52:58.174
Robert: We got heat out
above the 8th floor
in pruitt.

52:58.176 --> 53:00.676
That's at least
600 people.

53:03.880 --> 53:05.247
May I help you,
mrs. Masters?

53:05.249 --> 53:07.883
I was coming to ask you
the same thing.

53:07.885 --> 53:10.920
I was wondering
if you could use my help.

53:10.922 --> 53:12.888
You wanna volunteer?

53:13.490 --> 53:15.024
Yes.

53:17.794 --> 53:19.828
What can you do?

53:19.830 --> 53:22.865
I can type.
I can answer phones.

53:22.867 --> 53:25.434
I can stuff envelopes.

53:30.140 --> 53:33.809
We need someone
to make a sandwich run.

53:49.092 --> 53:51.660
What can I get for you?

53:52.362 --> 53:53.996
I'm fine.

53:54.397 --> 53:56.031
Really?
(bottle thuds)

53:56.033 --> 53:57.299
Nothing, huh?

53:57.301 --> 54:00.769
Usually I'm playing
catch up with you.

54:00.771 --> 54:02.871
(ice rattles)

54:04.641 --> 54:06.742
Does it help?

54:07.711 --> 54:10.279
You to be here
with me?

54:10.281 --> 54:13.015
I don't know
what you mean.

54:13.984 --> 54:15.651
Does drinking

54:15.653 --> 54:18.787
Help to relieve
your conscience about

54:18.789 --> 54:23.058
What it is
we're doing here
with each other?

54:23.060 --> 54:25.761
About what it is we're...

54:25.895 --> 54:28.163
We are doing to libby?

54:28.765 --> 54:30.232
Libby?

54:31.635 --> 54:35.204
(scoffs) where is
this all coming from
all of a sudden?

54:35.206 --> 54:39.375
Isn't the question
why hasn't it
come up sooner?

54:44.648 --> 54:46.248
I want to know.

54:46.250 --> 54:48.717
What things have we
told ourselves that
make it possible

54:48.719 --> 54:52.788
To do what it is
we've done here
in this room?

54:54.624 --> 54:55.791
(scoffs)

54:55.793 --> 54:57.126
It's not as
if you've told me

54:57.128 --> 54:58.627
That you don't love
your wife

54:58.629 --> 55:01.630
The way a married man
strings along a mistress.

55:01.632 --> 55:04.667
Well, I do love her.
I know.

55:04.669 --> 55:06.935
I love her, too.

55:07.337 --> 55:10.873
She's been
a wonderful friend
to me.

55:13.043 --> 55:18.380
I almost wish that
there was something that
I could point to, some

55:18.382 --> 55:20.683
Terrible thing that
she had done to me

55:20.685 --> 55:23.319
That would justify
what it is

55:23.321 --> 55:26.155
I've done to her.
But...

55:29.292 --> 55:31.560
There's nothing.

55:32.729 --> 55:36.265
What do you tell
yourself, bill,

55:36.766 --> 55:38.834
That makes
all of this okay?

55:38.836 --> 55:43.038
Jesus, virginia,
what's the matter
with you?

55:43.540 --> 55:45.341
I don't know.

55:45.343 --> 55:50.079
But maybe there is
something wrong with me,
with both of us.

55:50.081 --> 55:52.848
I wanna talk
about this, bill.
Why?

55:52.850 --> 55:53.482
What's the point?

55:53.484 --> 55:56.085
What does this
endless self-examination
accomplish,

55:56.087 --> 55:59.822
Except to make
everyone who engages
in it miserable?

55:59.824 --> 56:02.558
The past is past.
You can't change it.

56:02.560 --> 56:07.229
You can poke at it
and prod it,
but you cannot change it.

56:08.164 --> 56:09.832
So you move on.

56:10.233 --> 56:12.835
You do your best,
which is what I've done.

56:12.837 --> 56:14.770
I can move ahead
with certainty

56:14.772 --> 56:16.405
That I have never made
a decision

56:16.407 --> 56:18.941
With the intention
of hurting anyone.

56:18.943 --> 56:20.709
Then you're a fool.

56:20.711 --> 56:23.345
You don't think
any of this
would hurt libby?

56:23.347 --> 56:24.947
I don't intend
for her to find out.

56:24.949 --> 56:27.149
I see, so as long
as she remains oblivious...

56:27.151 --> 56:29.718
I weighed what
she did not know
against the value

56:29.720 --> 56:32.187
Of everything
we are trying to
accomplish here!

56:32.189 --> 56:34.323
No, no, we have
a greater purpose,
virginia.

56:34.325 --> 56:35.424
The study...
The study!

56:35.426 --> 56:38.394
It hasn't been about
the study in years, bill.

56:38.396 --> 56:41.530
When is the last time
we noted a session?

56:41.532 --> 56:42.765
Used a stopwatch?

56:42.767 --> 56:46.468
Added up anything
besides our bar tab?

56:46.970 --> 56:50.272
We cannot pretend
that there is any point

56:50.274 --> 56:52.174
To what
we are doing here

56:52.176 --> 56:54.276
Beyond our own
physical pleasure.

56:54.278 --> 56:55.511
What we do
in this room

56:55.513 --> 56:59.415
Does not make a damn
bit of difference to
anybody but us.

56:59.417 --> 57:00.549
It will.

57:00.551 --> 57:01.850
You can say that, but...
We are not gonna find

57:01.852 --> 57:05.954
The cure for dysfunction
in an exam room.
We're not.

57:05.956 --> 57:07.956
We can diagnose
individual conditions,

57:07.958 --> 57:08.991
We can rule out
underlying issues,

57:08.993 --> 57:13.095
But we're not gonna find
answers pairing impotent
men with prostitutes,

57:13.097 --> 57:15.664
Wives with husbands
whose sexual techniques

57:15.666 --> 57:16.365
Have made them frigid.

57:16.367 --> 57:20.335
It's gonna take
subjects that understand
sexual response.

57:20.337 --> 57:22.871
Who know
each other's body...

57:22.873 --> 57:23.739
What are you saying?

57:23.741 --> 57:28.277
That this is research
that you and I should
undertake here?

57:28.279 --> 57:29.711
That this is important
enough to justify

57:29.713 --> 57:31.914
What it is
we've done to libby?

57:32.582 --> 57:33.549
You can't treat

57:33.551 --> 57:36.452
A sexual dysfunction
theoretically.

57:36.454 --> 57:39.588
It's practical work.
It is trial and error.

57:39.590 --> 57:40.889
Yes, I'm aware
of that.
Then tell me, bill,

57:40.891 --> 57:45.127
What sexual dysfunction
are you proposing
we treat?

57:46.629 --> 57:48.096
Mine.
