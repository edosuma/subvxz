Hey! What are you doing?

01:23.417 --> 01:25.853
Get off! Off!

02:07.928 --> 02:11.031
And we're sure that this girl's
mother can be trusted?

02:11.131 --> 02:13.066
It's car pool, Deeks. Doesn't
require a security clearance.

02:13.167 --> 02:14.935
Did you run
a background check?
No.

02:15.035 --> 02:17.004
Did you run the driver's record
to make sure it was clean?

02:17.104 --> 02:18.839
Like, how do we know
she's not a road rager?

02:18.939 --> 02:20.508
Who isn't a road rager
in L.A., sweetie?
That's true.

02:20.608 --> 02:22.142
Come on. Car pool
gives us a chance

02:22.243 --> 02:24.512
to do stuff for ourselves,
such as jogging.

02:24.612 --> 02:26.380
Yeah, but driving Rosa
to school,

02:26.480 --> 02:28.382
like, listening
to podcasts. Yeah.

02:28.482 --> 02:30.218
Or introducing her
to '70s rock is, like,

02:30.318 --> 02:31.819
the highlight of my day.
No, me, too.

02:31.919 --> 02:34.021
But on Mondays, Wednesdays and
Fridays, you still get that.

02:34.121 --> 02:36.857
Right. So Tuesdays and Thursdays
are just gonna suck.

02:36.957 --> 02:39.260
Are you saying that spending
time with your wife sucks?
Oh!

02:39.360 --> 02:40.828
No, no, I would...

02:40.928 --> 02:42.863
I-I would never say...
How dare you?
Uh-huh.

02:42.963 --> 02:45.366
Well, good,
because I really feel like

02:45.466 --> 02:46.734
we need
to spend more time together.

02:46.834 --> 02:48.502
Because spending all day
together as superheroes

02:48.602 --> 02:50.371
fighting crime-- that-that's
not enough for you?

02:50.471 --> 02:52.440
Okay, A) We're not superheroes. Eh.

02:52.540 --> 02:54.375
And B) I'm talking
about actual alone time.

02:54.475 --> 02:55.876
Just you and me.
Like romance.

02:55.976 --> 02:57.511
Shh.
Do you even remember
what that feels like?

02:57.611 --> 02:59.647
We don't need romance.
We're married.

02:59.747 --> 03:01.282
How can you
say that, honey?

03:01.382 --> 03:04.685
Because romance is a scam
to get to what we already have.

03:04.785 --> 03:06.387
Okay, stop. What are you
talking about?

03:06.487 --> 03:08.789
I'm saying that romance is based
on lies. Think about this.

03:08.889 --> 03:10.691
You wear clothes
you would normally never wear.

03:10.791 --> 03:12.092
You put on perfume and cologne

03:12.192 --> 03:14.161
to lie about
how your body actually smells.

03:14.262 --> 03:15.863
Deeks, I'm...
And don't even get me started

03:15.963 --> 03:17.731
on bouquets, because you
know what? The flowers are dead.

03:17.831 --> 03:19.667
You know
who murdered those flowers?

03:19.767 --> 03:22.603
Romance.
This makes me so sad.

03:22.703 --> 03:24.638
I had no idea
that you felt this way.

03:24.738 --> 03:26.807
See? More lies,
and at least now we're married,

03:26.907 --> 03:29.009
and the charade can stop.
No, I'm sorry.

03:29.109 --> 03:30.678
I don't want to go through life
on autopilot,

03:30.778 --> 03:32.145
just going
through the motions, okay?

03:32.246 --> 03:33.581
It's not healthy.

03:33.681 --> 03:35.616
No, that's fair.
Okay?

03:35.716 --> 03:39.186
You're right. It would be... it
would be nice to maybe go back

03:39.287 --> 03:41.455
and do some of the fun stuff
that we used to do.
There it is.

03:41.555 --> 03:43.624
Okay.
You know what? We could
go to Leo's taco truck.

03:43.724 --> 03:44.992
I love Leo's taco truck.

03:45.092 --> 03:46.694
And that wine bar
that we love so much. Yup.

03:46.794 --> 03:48.061
We could see a movie.
Oh, a movie. See, date night.

03:48.161 --> 03:50.764
Not a date. Just the fun stuff
we used to do.

03:51.532 --> 03:53.066
Unbelievable.

03:53.166 --> 03:55.303
<i>No, Dad.
That was Korean barbecue.</i>

03:55.403 --> 03:57.438
This is Japanese food.

03:57.538 --> 04:00.140
Of course
there's a difference. Uh...

04:00.240 --> 04:02.142
I can't talk about this
right now, okay?

04:02.242 --> 04:04.378
We'll talk a little later. It's
gonna be a great dinner, okay?

04:04.478 --> 04:05.846
All right, bye.

04:05.946 --> 04:07.448
Admiral, good morning.

04:07.548 --> 04:10.751
Agent Hanna. Just the man
I need to speak with.
Yeah?

04:10.851 --> 04:12.720
You want to join me and my dad
at Benihana?

04:12.820 --> 04:13.754
I'm sure he'd love to have you.

04:13.854 --> 04:15.423
I'll think about it.

04:15.523 --> 04:16.957
In the meantime, there is

04:17.057 --> 04:19.460
something important
I need to discuss with you.

04:19.560 --> 04:21.595
Okay. What about?
Your partner.

04:21.695 --> 04:23.964
Agent Grisha Callen.

04:24.064 --> 04:25.733
He was sent TAD

04:25.833 --> 04:28.502
this morning
to assist the San Diego office

04:28.602 --> 04:31.305
in a Russian gun smuggler case.

04:31.405 --> 04:32.573
I got the memo.

04:32.673 --> 04:34.842
And he is
in a precarious situation.

04:34.942 --> 04:37.077
Something go down? Is he okay?

04:37.177 --> 04:39.079
In my opinion, no.

04:39.179 --> 04:41.982
But then there are
countless others who seem

04:42.082 --> 04:43.717
to think
that a lifelong commitment

04:43.817 --> 04:46.787
to one person makes sense,
so perhaps I'm wrong.

04:46.887 --> 04:49.390
Oh, you're talking
about his wedding?
His wedding.

04:49.490 --> 04:52.292
His dealings with Pembrook,
the whole thing with Katya.

04:52.393 --> 04:55.563
I mean, Agent Callen is spinning
several plates in the air.

04:55.663 --> 04:57.498
And you're worried
he may drop one.

04:57.598 --> 05:00.501
Well, as director of
the Office of Special Projects,

05:00.601 --> 05:05.005
I must be certain that all bases
are covered at all times.

05:05.105 --> 05:06.774
Well, if there's one thing
about Callen,

05:06.874 --> 05:08.642
he knows how
to take care of business.

05:08.742 --> 05:10.277
Yes, but if I have

05:10.378 --> 05:12.179
to leave town
to handle my own business,

05:12.279 --> 05:14.582
I am not convinced
that Agent Callen is

05:14.682 --> 05:18.652
in the right headspace to
take over for me when I'm gone.

05:18.752 --> 05:21.221
So, what are you thinking?

05:22.022 --> 05:24.758
I'm thinking
I need <i>you</i> to serve

05:24.858 --> 05:27.595
as the acting supervisor of OSP

05:27.695 --> 05:29.930
if and when duty calls.

05:31.732 --> 05:34.435
I appreciate the offer, Admiral.

05:34.535 --> 05:36.537
I'm not a desk guy.

05:36.637 --> 05:37.938
I-I belong in the field.

05:38.038 --> 05:39.473
I hope you understand.

05:39.573 --> 05:44.077
Oh, I do, but Callen
may not like this, especially

05:44.177 --> 05:47.247
if they send in
some blue-flame outsider.

05:47.347 --> 05:50.618
Uh, it'd be a lot easier for him
to accept you in the position.

05:50.718 --> 05:52.953
Oh.

05:54.054 --> 05:55.956
Can I think about it?

05:56.056 --> 05:58.792
Well, I don't need an answer
right now,

05:58.892 --> 06:02.329
but I do want you to seriously
consider this offer

06:02.430 --> 06:04.732
and what it would mean to you

06:04.832 --> 06:07.735
and, more importantly,
to the team.

06:25.819 --> 06:27.888
Hey, can I ask you something?

06:27.988 --> 06:30.357
Oh, no, not
video game trivia again.

06:30.458 --> 06:34.695
How often do you
think about the future?

06:34.795 --> 06:36.329
Every now and then, I guess.

06:36.430 --> 06:39.433
But, you know,
I try to stay present. Why?

06:39.533 --> 06:41.635
Lately, I just been obsessed.

06:41.735 --> 06:43.103
You know, especially after

06:43.203 --> 06:45.473
target practice
when my brain is just on ten.

06:45.573 --> 06:47.207
Doomsday prepping again?

06:47.307 --> 06:49.743
Of course
I got my end-of-the-world kit,

06:49.843 --> 06:51.479
but that's not
what I'm talking about.

06:51.579 --> 06:53.647
I'm talking about visualizing

06:53.747 --> 06:55.415
exactly what I want
in the future.

06:55.516 --> 06:58.118
Oh, like a vision board?
I love making those.

06:58.218 --> 07:00.754
No. I'm talking
about something concrete,

07:00.854 --> 07:02.355
not some magazine cut-outs

07:02.456 --> 07:03.891
put up on a poster board.

07:03.991 --> 07:05.793
I'm talking
about an actual ten-year plan.

07:05.893 --> 07:07.561
Okay, okay, yeah,
I feel that.

07:07.661 --> 07:11.131
You know, no judgment to people
who do, but, uh, what is it?

07:11.231 --> 07:13.066
You know the denim brand
that I invested in?

07:13.166 --> 07:16.203
Mm-hmm.
All right, so I'm seeing
just crazy returns from that.

07:16.303 --> 07:18.572
Right? So, I figure,
after about a year of savings,

07:18.672 --> 07:20.373
I could buy a home in L.A.

07:20.474 --> 07:21.942
That's great. Then,

07:22.042 --> 07:24.878
I'm gonna invest in another
start-up, but this time

07:24.978 --> 07:27.380
something I believe in,
something that could...

07:27.481 --> 07:29.249
actually change the world.

07:29.349 --> 07:32.419
Yeah, passive
and conscious income. Smart.

07:32.520 --> 07:34.488
Yeah. Thanks.

07:34.588 --> 07:35.989
Is there any chance

07:36.089 --> 07:39.059
a special someone inspired
this new direction?

07:39.159 --> 07:41.862
Come on, you know
you can tell me.

07:43.330 --> 07:44.698
Bell saved you.
We got a case.

07:44.798 --> 07:45.966
Oh, thank God.

07:46.066 --> 07:47.535
Yeah, you got lucky
this time.

07:51.438 --> 07:53.240
What do we have?

07:53.340 --> 07:56.409
So, late last night,
a retired Navy reservist,

07:56.510 --> 07:58.111
Commander Dr. Darryl Howard,

07:58.211 --> 08:01.982
was nearly stabbed to death at
his lab at Whitley University.

08:02.082 --> 08:04.852
He's a tenured professor
of entomology there.

08:04.952 --> 08:06.486
A bug scientist.

08:06.587 --> 08:07.788
I know.
Y-Yeah.

08:07.888 --> 08:10.490
He's currently in a coma
right now at Cedars.

08:10.591 --> 08:13.493
Most of his research deals
with pesticides.

08:13.594 --> 08:14.762
They ransacked his lab.

08:14.862 --> 08:16.129
LAPD's down there now

08:16.229 --> 08:17.698
trying to determine
exactly what was stolen.

08:17.798 --> 08:19.366
What's our connection?
Well,

08:19.466 --> 08:21.234
Dr. Howard often works
on special projects

08:21.334 --> 08:23.370
for the Office
of Naval Research.

08:23.470 --> 08:26.139
Admiral Kilbride is looking into
what he's currently working on.

08:26.239 --> 08:28.008
What's more pressing is,
this time last year,

08:28.108 --> 08:30.110
a similar incident happened
at Glenforest University

08:30.210 --> 08:31.812
in one of their labs.

08:31.912 --> 08:33.446
And gallons
of pesticides were stolen.

08:33.547 --> 08:35.248
Let me guess. Bombs.

08:35.348 --> 08:38.719
Yes, the stolen pesticides were
used to manufacture explosives

08:38.819 --> 08:40.821
which were traced back
to a bombing

08:40.921 --> 08:43.090
at a city council
office in Downey.

08:43.190 --> 08:44.391
Six people were injured.

08:44.491 --> 08:46.159
Any suspects?
Well, the investigation's

08:46.259 --> 08:47.861
still ongoing, but FBI thinks

08:47.961 --> 08:50.063
that maybe the members
of this extremist,

08:50.163 --> 08:52.499
anti-government group
could be behind it.

08:52.600 --> 08:55.302
The Patriot Mission Society.

08:55.402 --> 08:56.904
Any surveillance cameras
in the lab?

08:57.004 --> 08:59.907
No, but there was
an exterior camera that caught

09:00.007 --> 09:02.175
a masked suspect entering
and running out.

09:02.275 --> 09:04.945
I don't know how I'm supposed
to ID anything off of this.

09:05.045 --> 09:07.180
Well, he seems
to be carrying a duffel bag.

09:07.280 --> 09:08.616
It would take gallons
of pesticides

09:08.716 --> 09:10.017
to blow up anything substantial.

09:10.117 --> 09:11.819
They'd need several duffel bags.

09:11.919 --> 09:14.521
Not necessarily.
So, Dr. Howard has access

09:14.622 --> 09:16.056
to what the EPA classifies

09:16.156 --> 09:18.191
as "severely restricted use"
chemicals.

09:18.291 --> 09:20.761
Can't find those at your local
home improvement store.

09:20.861 --> 09:22.562
Mm-mm. Some are
so highly concentrated,

09:22.663 --> 09:25.799
it would not take much
to produce a powerful weapon.

09:25.899 --> 09:28.501
Okay. What about
Dr. Howard's family?

09:28.602 --> 09:30.037
Well, I located a Layla Lewis.

09:30.137 --> 09:32.039
It's his wife, or ex-wife,

09:32.139 --> 09:34.007
ex-domestic partner,
estranged wife?

09:34.107 --> 09:35.442
It's complicated.

09:35.542 --> 09:37.377
Okay. Have Castor
take her to the boatshed.

09:37.477 --> 09:39.012
Have Kensi and Deeks
meet them there.

09:39.112 --> 09:40.614
Rountree and I will
hit the crime scene.

09:40.714 --> 09:42.716
And, Fatima, I want you
to find out everything you can

09:42.816 --> 09:44.184
about this
Patriot Mission Society.

09:44.284 --> 09:46.086
Copy that.
If they're planning
another bombing,

09:46.186 --> 09:47.554
we want to figure this out

09:47.655 --> 09:50.490
before more innocent people
get hurt. Come on.

10:01.534 --> 10:04.171
Wow.

10:08.308 --> 10:09.877
The hard drive
is missing.

10:09.977 --> 10:11.979
The attacker might
have taken it.

10:12.746 --> 10:15.382
Yeah. This place
really is ransacked.

10:15.482 --> 10:17.517
Yup.

10:17.617 --> 10:20.287
Everything is torn apart.

10:20.387 --> 10:21.822
Everything but these shelves.

10:21.922 --> 10:23.623
Well, maybe
just like everybody else,

10:23.724 --> 10:25.793
they hated bugs,
so they didn't come over here.

10:25.893 --> 10:27.427
Or maybe they were trying
to throw us off,

10:27.527 --> 10:29.496
stage a crime scene,

10:29.596 --> 10:31.198
cover up
what they really wanted.

10:31.999 --> 10:34.001
Maybe what they really wanted
was right here.

10:34.101 --> 10:37.971
We need to talk to someone who
knows this lab inside and out.

10:40.173 --> 10:42.309
Hey.

10:42.409 --> 10:45.245
Hey, guys.
This is Layla Lewis.

10:45.345 --> 10:46.914
Hello.
How are you?

10:47.014 --> 10:49.416
Uh, thank you, Castor.
Thank you.
Thank you for joining us.

10:49.516 --> 10:51.351
Please have a seat.

10:51.451 --> 10:53.053
Um, could you tell us
a little bit

10:53.153 --> 10:55.422
about your relationship
with Dr. Howard?

10:55.522 --> 10:57.057
Oh, we're not together anymore.

10:57.157 --> 10:59.192
But you were together for
a long period of time, yes?

10:59.292 --> 11:00.527
Yes. Uh,

11:00.627 --> 11:02.395
we had a beautiful
commitment ceremony

11:02.495 --> 11:04.832
up in Oakland
about 20 years ago.

11:04.932 --> 11:07.768
Hmm.
We loved each other
deeply, but

11:07.868 --> 11:10.070
the only thing that
Darryl Howard is committed to

11:10.170 --> 11:11.571
is his work.

11:11.671 --> 11:13.606
How long have you been
separated?

11:13.707 --> 11:15.175
About five years.

11:15.275 --> 11:17.845
He's lovely, a genius.

11:17.945 --> 11:19.546
He wanted

11:19.646 --> 11:21.648
to change the world
with his insects.

11:21.749 --> 11:23.984
How exactly?
By making sure

11:24.084 --> 11:26.619
people understand
what we're doing to the <i>'aina.</i>

11:26.720 --> 11:28.321
The-the Earth.

11:28.421 --> 11:30.924
Uh, the insects, the animals.

11:31.024 --> 11:33.326
He studies the effects
certain chemicals

11:33.426 --> 11:35.562
have on the environment.

11:35.662 --> 11:37.564
He's not driven by money.

11:37.664 --> 11:39.933
He's driven
by a love of science

11:40.033 --> 11:42.002
and understanding.

11:42.102 --> 11:44.537
I always admired that
about him.

11:44.637 --> 11:47.074
Just couldn't be with him.

11:47.174 --> 11:48.842
It's so easy to lose touch

11:48.942 --> 11:51.378
with someone when all you do
is talk about work

11:51.478 --> 11:53.380
and the day-to-day grind.

11:53.480 --> 11:55.615
Mm. I know what you mean.

11:55.715 --> 11:58.919
We still talked.

11:59.019 --> 12:00.954
I'm so sorry to hear
what happened to him.

12:01.054 --> 12:03.056
I guess it all makes sense now.

12:03.156 --> 12:05.025
What makes sense?

12:05.125 --> 12:07.627
Lately, he was calling me
with these crazy stories.

12:07.727 --> 12:10.463
I was worried about him.
I told him

12:10.563 --> 12:12.465
to go see a doctor,
get some help

12:12.565 --> 12:14.001
before something bad happened.

12:14.101 --> 12:15.202
What stories?

12:15.302 --> 12:17.237
People after him.

12:17.337 --> 12:20.573
Hacking his emails,
tapping his phone.

12:20.673 --> 12:22.675
Trying to ruin his career.

12:22.776 --> 12:24.878
Trying to kill him.

12:25.846 --> 12:28.548
Oh, my God.
Sorry. Did Dr. Howard

12:28.648 --> 12:30.818
say who he thought
was after him?

12:30.918 --> 12:32.920
He didn't really know. He...

12:33.020 --> 12:34.754
He tried not
to say too much on the phone.

12:34.855 --> 12:37.757
But when he started
talking about canceling

12:37.858 --> 12:39.793
his speaking engagements, I...

12:39.893 --> 12:41.628
I started to worry
about his mental health.

12:41.728 --> 12:43.530
When was this?
A few months ago.

12:43.630 --> 12:48.201
He thought that someone
in the audience was after him,

12:48.301 --> 12:52.139
that they were following him
from lecture to lecture.

12:53.006 --> 12:54.641
I didn't believe him.

12:54.741 --> 12:57.377
I just thought it was
some kind of psychosis. I...

12:57.477 --> 12:59.446
I guess I was wrong.

13:00.213 --> 13:02.115
I'm a horrible person.
Oh, my gosh.

13:02.215 --> 13:04.184
No, Layla, you...
you are not a horrible person.

13:04.284 --> 13:05.785
There is no way
you could have known

13:05.886 --> 13:07.587
this was going to happen to him.

13:08.355 --> 13:10.590
Darryl didn't deserve this.

13:10.690 --> 13:13.693
He's such a kind soul.

13:16.696 --> 13:19.332
Is this an inventory list?
Yes.

13:19.432 --> 13:20.868
Right. Double-check it.

13:20.968 --> 13:22.669
Uh, Dr. Howard's hard drive
is missing.

13:22.769 --> 13:25.138
Who would want access to that?

13:25.238 --> 13:26.473
No idea.

13:26.573 --> 13:28.842
Oh, that's weird.

13:28.942 --> 13:31.044
It says there are four
moth cages.

13:31.144 --> 13:33.847
Moths.
You're Dr. Howard's
assistant.

13:33.947 --> 13:35.215
Shouldn't you know
what was there?

13:35.315 --> 13:37.918
Yes, but I was out of town
for two weeks.

13:38.018 --> 13:40.620
Maybe somebody moved it
and forgot to indicate that?

13:40.720 --> 13:42.089
Maybe they were stolen.

13:42.189 --> 13:44.557
LAPD is still
processing the lab.

13:44.657 --> 13:46.994
Are there any pesticides
missing?

13:47.995 --> 13:51.098
Actually, there are
several containers missing.

13:51.198 --> 13:52.900
They're from his most
recent research.

13:53.000 --> 13:54.868
If someone stole pesticides
with the intention

13:54.968 --> 13:58.771
of making a bomb, why would they
take Dr. Howard's hard drive?
And moths.

13:58.872 --> 14:01.408
What, exactly, is Dr. Howard
working on?

14:01.508 --> 14:05.545
He studies the negative effects
pesticides have on soil,

14:05.645 --> 14:09.316
insects, reptiles, and
ultimately on us, humans.

14:09.416 --> 14:13.153
His theories were published
in every major science journal.

14:13.253 --> 14:15.388
Dr. Howard's research could
make or break

14:15.488 --> 14:17.891
big agrochemical companies
like Monsanto.

14:17.991 --> 14:20.160
You know, if we had a list
of all the pesticides

14:20.260 --> 14:22.729
that Dr. Howard was researching,
we could cross-check that

14:22.829 --> 14:24.932
with the companies
that manufacture them.

14:25.032 --> 14:26.566
I could put one together.

14:26.666 --> 14:28.135
That would be helpful.
Thank you.

14:33.573 --> 14:36.809
Can I help you
find something?

14:36.910 --> 14:38.045
You know, Hetty had me organize
her office,

14:38.145 --> 14:39.446
so I know where everything is.

14:39.546 --> 14:41.281
Won't be necessary.

14:41.381 --> 14:44.751
May I ask what it is
you're looking for?

14:44.851 --> 14:48.288
You may, but your asking
does not entitle you

14:48.388 --> 14:51.324
to a response, Agent Namazi.

14:51.424 --> 14:54.661
Where are we with the
Patriot Mission Society?

14:54.761 --> 14:57.364
Well, I managed to locate
every one of its members,

14:57.464 --> 15:00.267
and it is highly unlikely
that they're behind this.

15:00.367 --> 15:02.869
Five are in prison,
one was killed last year,

15:02.970 --> 15:05.705
and the seventh has been
in the ICU for the last month,

15:05.805 --> 15:10.043
sustaining injuries from
an intense bar fight.

15:10.143 --> 15:11.344
Well, let's broaden the search.

15:11.444 --> 15:14.948
Look for other groups
or individuals

15:15.048 --> 15:17.350
who are known to make bombs
with pesticides.

15:17.450 --> 15:21.288
Domestic terrorism comes in all
shapes and forms these days.

15:21.388 --> 15:23.090
Copy that.

15:24.424 --> 15:25.525
You sure I can't help you
find anything?

15:31.164 --> 15:33.433
<i>Dr. Howard spoke
at five conferences</i>

15:33.533 --> 15:34.434
this year.

15:34.534 --> 15:35.868
All five conference venues

15:35.969 --> 15:37.971
filed incident reports
with security

15:38.071 --> 15:39.572
during his lecture. Wow.

15:39.672 --> 15:40.940
Looks like these science symposiums

15:41.041 --> 15:42.242
can get pretty rowdy.

15:42.342 --> 15:44.211
Yeah. And at his last lecture,
get this.

15:44.311 --> 15:47.347
A heckler from the audience
harassed Dr. Howard

15:47.447 --> 15:48.681
and had to be removed.

15:48.781 --> 15:50.984
A woman in her 30s.
Didn't have ID on her,

15:51.084 --> 15:52.219
and security didn't get
a name. Great.

15:52.319 --> 15:54.421
Hey, Fatima, we got
a potential suspect

15:54.521 --> 15:59.126
for you. A unruly heckler at
Dr. Howard's last lecture.

15:59.226 --> 16:00.593
All right, do we have a name?
We don't.

16:00.693 --> 16:02.462
But that's where you come in.
If you can find

16:02.562 --> 16:03.930
the footage of the lecture,
maybe we can spot and ID her.

16:04.031 --> 16:05.398
And it was at
the Terrace Theater.

16:05.498 --> 16:06.499
I'm on it.

16:06.599 --> 16:07.900
Thank you.
Keep us posted.

16:08.001 --> 16:09.969
The Terrace Theater.
How do I know that?

16:10.070 --> 16:11.338
That's in Long Beach?

16:11.438 --> 16:12.539
Yes, it is.

16:12.639 --> 16:14.174
That's where we saw
The Queen Experience.

16:14.274 --> 16:16.743
Yes, it is.
That was a fun night.

16:16.843 --> 16:17.977
That was a fun night.
See?

16:18.078 --> 16:19.446
That's what I'm
talking about, babe.

16:19.546 --> 16:21.114
Yeah, but we have
different types of fun now.

16:21.214 --> 16:23.850
We have, like, you know,
couples fun, married fun.

16:23.950 --> 16:25.152
You know, we go
to the supermarket

16:25.252 --> 16:26.553
and go to Costco and have
the little samples

16:26.653 --> 16:29.056
and-and do car pools
and-and family dinners, right?

16:29.156 --> 16:30.457
Yeah, absolutely.

16:30.557 --> 16:33.593
Do you remember what
Layla Lewis said earlier?

16:33.693 --> 16:36.463
That Dr. Howard wants to
save the world with insects?

16:36.563 --> 16:37.830
N-No.

16:37.930 --> 16:39.532
I was referring to
the other thing she said,

16:39.632 --> 16:43.236
which is, it's easy
to lose touch with each other

16:43.336 --> 16:46.306
if all we discuss is
the daily grind.

16:46.406 --> 16:48.275
Yeah, listen, I get that,
but you know this,

16:48.375 --> 16:50.443
that you are the most
important thing to me

16:50.543 --> 16:53.012
in the world.

16:53.113 --> 16:56.449
But also, we only have
377 left.

16:56.549 --> 16:59.186
377 what?

16:59.286 --> 17:01.888
Days until Rosa graduates
high school

17:01.988 --> 17:03.356
and goes out into the world.

17:03.456 --> 17:04.991
She's gonna be
a full-blown adult in 377 days.

17:05.092 --> 17:06.593
I know that seems like a lot,
but it's not.

17:06.693 --> 17:08.061
It's only, like,
582,000 minutes.

17:08.161 --> 17:10.430
And if you turn that into
seconds, you times it by 60.

17:10.530 --> 17:14.367
So it's 32 million seconds,
but that flies by.
Hey, Deeks.

17:14.467 --> 17:16.569
I love that you love
being in a family

17:16.669 --> 17:18.905
and that you love doing
family things

17:19.005 --> 17:19.906
because I do, too,

17:20.006 --> 17:21.641
of course.

17:21.741 --> 17:27.180
But I just don't ever want
to lose touch with being us.

17:32.018 --> 17:33.720
Arjun.

17:33.820 --> 17:36.923
I sent your office a list with
the names of the pesticides

17:37.023 --> 17:38.591
Dr. Howard was
currently studying,

17:38.691 --> 17:41.594
and I also included a chart
of his ranking system.

17:41.694 --> 17:43.230
It rates each pesticide

17:43.330 --> 17:45.165
according to safety
and efficacy.

17:45.265 --> 17:47.434
Whoever did this seemed to be
fast and efficient,

17:47.534 --> 17:49.769
which suggests they may have
been inside the lab before.

17:49.869 --> 17:51.871
Fatima already cleared everyone
with badge access.

17:51.971 --> 17:55.442
Arjun, is there any other way
for someone without a badge

17:55.542 --> 17:56.709
to get inside the lab?

17:56.809 --> 17:58.578
Visitors that enter
with badge holders

17:58.678 --> 17:59.946
sign in here
at the front desk.

18:00.046 --> 18:02.081
All right, you're free to go.

18:03.350 --> 18:06.553
It's possible Dr. Howard was
about to publish

18:06.653 --> 18:09.956
damning research about the
effect of pesticides on moths.

18:10.056 --> 18:11.591
Manufacturer could lose billions,

18:11.691 --> 18:13.993
so they sent somebody up here
to get the affected moths.

18:14.093 --> 18:15.495
And their pesticides.

18:15.595 --> 18:17.630
FATIMA
Sam, you were right.

18:17.730 --> 18:19.166
Dr. Howard was researching
nine different types

18:19.266 --> 18:20.967
of pesticides recently.

18:21.067 --> 18:23.436
But there are two that
he highly criticized:

18:23.536 --> 18:24.471
Matrazine

18:24.571 --> 18:25.405
and Nitrithazine.

18:25.505 --> 18:26.906
What did he say about 'em?

18:27.006 --> 18:28.808
Well, they're listed as
highly toxic.

18:28.908 --> 18:31.144
And he claims that they change
the cell structures in lizards.

18:31.244 --> 18:33.112
Anything about moths?

18:33.213 --> 18:34.914
Not that I'm seeing. Hmm.

18:35.014 --> 18:35.948
Who's the manufacturer?

18:36.048 --> 18:38.117
Allurum Tech and GenBioSys.

18:38.218 --> 18:40.253
If these pesticides
can change

18:40.353 --> 18:42.088
the cell structure
of a lizard...

18:42.189 --> 18:43.756
Then it's possible they're
harmful to humans.

18:43.856 --> 18:45.292
There is more.

18:45.392 --> 18:46.826
Allurum Tech and GenBioSys
both saw

18:46.926 --> 18:49.596
a significant loss in sales
in the last three months.

18:49.696 --> 18:52.031
Right around the time
Dr. Howard published

18:52.131 --> 18:53.433
his most recent research.

18:53.533 --> 18:55.602
That sounds a lot like
a motive to me.

18:55.702 --> 18:57.304
Yeah, a whole lot of motive.

18:57.404 --> 19:00.039
If one of these companies is
targeting Dr. Howard,

19:00.139 --> 19:03.042
we need to figure out
which one.

19:16.256 --> 19:17.156
Enter.

19:17.257 --> 19:18.625
Sir, I have an update.

19:18.725 --> 19:20.260
I'm listening.

19:20.360 --> 19:21.561
So, the audience heckler

19:21.661 --> 19:23.596
that interrupted
Dr. Howard's lectures

19:23.696 --> 19:25.064
is Natasha Graham.

19:25.164 --> 19:27.600
Now, she's a PR
manager for GenBioSys.

19:27.700 --> 19:30.069
I found a video of her online.

19:30.169 --> 19:31.238
Excellent. Let's see it.

19:31.338 --> 19:32.472
The video?

19:32.572 --> 19:35.642
Yes, the video.

19:35.742 --> 19:37.777
Okay, just, it's kind of silly.

19:37.877 --> 19:40.447
It's like a college student
made it for social media.

19:40.547 --> 19:43.983
Just keep that in mind.

19:44.083 --> 19:45.852
This is unnecessary.

19:45.952 --> 19:48.388
All I said was check your facts.

19:48.488 --> 19:53.593
Check-check-check-check-check-
check-check-check your facts!

19:55.895 --> 19:58.731
People have entirely
too much time on their hands.

19:58.831 --> 20:01.801
GenBioSys has been trying
to disparage Dr. Howard,

20:01.901 --> 20:03.870
hoping to discredit
his research.

20:03.970 --> 20:05.572
Which leaves me to wonder
just how far

20:05.672 --> 20:07.340
this corporation's willing
to go

20:07.440 --> 20:08.775
to protect their product.

20:08.875 --> 20:11.411
Well, Kensi and Deeks
are heading there now.

20:11.511 --> 20:14.013
I'd like to welcome all of you
to GenBioSys.

20:14.113 --> 20:17.617
These daily tours introduce
our newest varieties

20:17.717 --> 20:19.852
and put the best
of our innovations on display,

20:19.952 --> 20:23.089
bringing together the entire
vegetable supply chain.

20:23.189 --> 20:24.457
And you said I don't
take you anywhere.

20:24.557 --> 20:25.925
Hi. Sorry we're late.
Thank you.

20:26.025 --> 20:29.896
We came all the way from
San Luis Obispo, so sorry.

20:29.996 --> 20:31.431
One example of our innovative technology

20:31.531 --> 20:34.834
is LHUZ 18-9922.

20:34.934 --> 20:38.671
Better known to most people
simply as lettuce.

20:39.872 --> 20:41.508
It has the taste
of romaine

20:41.608 --> 20:43.310
but the crunchiness
of iceberg,

20:43.410 --> 20:45.545
and it retains its crunchiness
when heated.

20:45.645 --> 20:48.281
Perfect on a burger.
Uh-huh.

20:48.381 --> 20:49.549
Please take a bite.

20:49.649 --> 20:51.284
Oh, mm-hmm.

20:52.352 --> 20:53.786
Strawberries or wine?

20:53.886 --> 20:56.656
Oh, no, thank you. This is, this
is plenty right here.

20:56.756 --> 20:58.124
No, you said you're from
San Luis Obispo.

20:58.224 --> 21:00.893
Do you grow strawberries
or wine grapes?

21:00.993 --> 21:02.061
Or garlic, maybe.
We grow wine--

21:02.161 --> 21:03.763
We drink wine. Sorry.
We love wine.

21:03.863 --> 21:06.165
Vineyards. We have
acres and acres of vineyards.

21:06.265 --> 21:08.535
You've probably heard of us.
The Smithingtonses?

21:08.635 --> 21:09.502
Oh.
Yeah, no,

21:09.602 --> 21:10.537
Smithington Wineries.

21:10.637 --> 21:12.905
Wow, uh, what variety?

21:13.005 --> 21:15.107
Ch... sauvignon blanc.
Um, chardonnay.

21:15.207 --> 21:16.443
Chardonnay.
Chardonnay, mainly.

21:16.543 --> 21:17.344
Also both-- we do.
Little bit.

21:17.444 --> 21:18.611
It's buttery, oaky.

21:18.711 --> 21:19.612
We-we age 'em in oak,

21:19.712 --> 21:20.813
and we get the pear...

21:20.913 --> 21:22.682
Yeah, like very...
...and the apple.

21:22.782 --> 21:24.116
...like the floral notes.
White floral notes.

21:24.216 --> 21:25.918
That makes it so world
"reknowned."
Yeah.

21:26.018 --> 21:27.854
Amazing.
Renowned.

21:27.954 --> 21:29.822
It's always been a dream
of mine to own a vineyard.

21:29.922 --> 21:31.591
Oh, it's really quite--
It's wonderful.

21:31.691 --> 21:33.760
And it's so romantic,
you know.

21:33.860 --> 21:35.495
I mean, that's really what
I love the most about it.

21:35.595 --> 21:37.430
Yeah, babe?
Yeah.

21:37.530 --> 21:41.000
Okay, everyone, follow me
to the tomato plants.

21:41.100 --> 21:43.269
Hey, yeah.
I'm gonna stay here and
keep trying this lettuce.

21:43.370 --> 21:46.473
Mmm.
This "perfect for burgers"
lettuce.

21:46.573 --> 21:48.908
Deeks, look.
Mm-hmm.

21:49.008 --> 21:50.943
Hmm?

21:51.043 --> 21:52.078
Come on.

21:57.650 --> 21:59.185
Natasha Graham?

21:59.285 --> 22:01.821
I'd like to ask you
a question.
How can I help you?

22:01.921 --> 22:03.122
You don't happen to have
any kale

22:03.222 --> 22:05.024
that doesn't taste
like kale, do you?

22:05.124 --> 22:06.926
Uh, what can you tell us

22:07.026 --> 22:08.528
about Dr. Darryl Howard?

22:08.628 --> 22:10.497
Who wants to know?

22:10.597 --> 22:12.865
NCIS wants to know.

22:12.965 --> 22:14.266
We're just ch-ch-checking
the facts.

22:14.367 --> 22:17.336
All I said was check your facts.
Ch-Ch-Check...

22:17.437 --> 22:19.338
Thank you.

22:19.439 --> 22:22.008
If someone from GenBioSys was
trying to case the lab,

22:22.108 --> 22:24.477
they would sign in here
using a fake name.

22:24.577 --> 22:27.146
Well, I'm only seeing
one visitor for Dr. Howard.

22:27.246 --> 22:29.482
Claire Winchester
of Braddock University.

22:29.582 --> 22:30.817
Mm-hmm.

22:30.917 --> 22:32.051
She was here five nights
in a row.

22:32.151 --> 22:33.820
It's too risky
for Natasha Graham

22:33.920 --> 22:35.588
or anyone from GenBioSys.

22:35.688 --> 22:37.790
Could be another colleague.

22:37.890 --> 22:40.460
Hmm. Yo, Fatima,

22:40.560 --> 22:41.628
can you give me an address for

22:41.728 --> 22:42.662
Claire Winchester
from Braddock?

22:42.762 --> 22:43.963
Yep. Sure thing.

22:44.063 --> 22:45.698
She spent a lot of time
with Dr. Howard,

22:45.798 --> 22:48.300
which means she may have known
what kind of trouble he was in.

22:50.470 --> 22:53.072
Check-check-check-check,
check your facts!

22:53.172 --> 22:55.608
It's an entertaining video.
Probably went viral.

22:55.708 --> 22:57.243
Wasn't me.

22:57.343 --> 22:59.011
I'm guessing you're
one of many people

22:59.111 --> 23:01.247
that GenBioSys sent to follow
and harass Dr. Howard.

23:01.347 --> 23:02.649
That broke in,
attacked him,

23:02.749 --> 23:04.016
and then stole his research.

23:04.116 --> 23:07.119
What? I didn't attack him.

23:07.219 --> 23:08.555
Is he okay?

23:08.655 --> 23:09.589
No, he's not okay.

23:09.689 --> 23:11.390
He's in the ICU in a coma.

23:14.260 --> 23:16.996
I only went to one
of Dr. Howard's talks.

23:17.096 --> 23:19.532
And threatened him
the day before he was attacked?

23:19.632 --> 23:21.901
Okay, but I didn't attack him.

23:22.001 --> 23:24.303
Dr. Howard knew how
important the launch

23:24.403 --> 23:27.540
of our new pesticide was
to this company, to me.

23:27.640 --> 23:29.442
And I had to do something.

23:29.542 --> 23:30.543
Did you know him personally?

23:30.643 --> 23:32.178
Not really.

23:32.278 --> 23:34.947
GenBioSys contracted Dr. Howard
to study the pesticide

23:35.047 --> 23:37.049
right after I got promoted
to this job.

23:37.149 --> 23:38.985
So to clarify,
you guys hired him

23:39.085 --> 23:40.653
to research your pesticide?

23:40.753 --> 23:41.854
And when the results
were unfavorable,

23:41.954 --> 23:44.423
GenBioSys launched
a smear campaign

23:44.524 --> 23:45.458
to discredit him.

23:45.558 --> 23:46.659
Please keep it down.

23:46.759 --> 23:51.363
Matrazine was
my first big project.

23:51.464 --> 23:53.733
Other scientists concluded
the pesticide was fine.

23:53.833 --> 23:55.602
Even Dr. Howard at first.

23:55.702 --> 23:57.269
So what changed?

23:59.105 --> 24:00.807
A colleague of mine got wind

24:00.907 --> 24:02.542
that he was working
for someone else.

24:02.642 --> 24:03.676
A competitor?

24:03.776 --> 24:05.044
I have no idea.

24:05.144 --> 24:06.679
But after Dr. Howard
was confronted about it,

24:06.779 --> 24:09.782
suddenly he believed Matrazine
would poison the Midwest,

24:09.882 --> 24:11.518
and babies would grow
two heads.

24:11.618 --> 24:12.952
Maybe the science evolved.

24:13.052 --> 24:15.321
Well, my job depended
on the first results.

24:15.421 --> 24:17.757
So, yes, I did try
to discredit him,

24:17.857 --> 24:19.759
but I did not attack him.

24:19.859 --> 24:22.128
Where were you last night?

24:25.131 --> 24:27.900
On a crappy Tinder date
at Del Frisco's.

24:28.000 --> 24:31.504
Talk to a waiter named Rodney.
He saved me.

24:31.604 --> 24:34.306
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have to get back to work.

24:35.608 --> 24:36.843
Ooh.

24:38.511 --> 24:41.013
Oh, yeah, I can see myself
living in this neighborhood.

24:41.113 --> 24:43.750
Nice front yard,
and it's close to work.

24:43.850 --> 24:45.518
And it'll set you back
a million.

24:47.119 --> 24:50.957
Damn. Maybe I should
start shopping in Texas.

24:51.057 --> 24:52.725
Looks like Dr Winchester's
office was right.

24:52.825 --> 24:55.628
She's working from home today.

24:55.728 --> 24:57.429
Hold up.

24:57.530 --> 24:59.599
Dr. Winchester?

25:05.972 --> 25:07.874
Dr. Winchester,
we're federal agents!

25:07.974 --> 25:09.942
Everything okay in there?!

25:25.825 --> 25:27.226
You okay?
Yeah, yeah, I'm good.

25:29.028 --> 25:31.030
He went out here.

25:38.705 --> 25:41.107
I can't get a clean shot.

25:44.877 --> 25:47.413
Go! Go! Move!

25:54.520 --> 25:55.988
I got him.

26:07.033 --> 26:08.567
I think the prices
in this neighborhood

26:08.668 --> 26:10.302
might have just dropped.

26:22.682 --> 26:25.417
Yeah.
Thanks, Fatima.

26:25.517 --> 26:26.653
So, Fatima's got a BOLO out.

26:26.753 --> 26:28.420
Kaleidoscope is up and running.

26:28.520 --> 26:29.922
Didn't get any hits yet.

26:30.022 --> 26:31.490
Well, and, unfortunately,
none of the neighbors

26:31.590 --> 26:33.325
have cameras facing the alley.

26:33.425 --> 26:34.526
What about the dead guy?

26:34.627 --> 26:37.529
No ID. I sent a photo
to Fatima.

26:37.630 --> 26:39.465
Claire Winchester.

26:39.565 --> 26:42.001
She spent a lot of time
in Dr. Howard's lab.

26:42.101 --> 26:44.170
Someone sent three
armed men to kidnap her.

26:44.270 --> 26:45.604
Well, maybe she and
Dr. Howard were

26:45.705 --> 26:46.906
working on something together.

26:47.006 --> 26:48.775
Or Dr. Howard didn't have
what they needed,

26:48.875 --> 26:51.678
and they thought Claire
knew where to find it.

26:51.778 --> 26:53.345
I'll start with
the house, all right?

26:53.445 --> 26:55.715
Try to make a connection
between Winchester and Howard.

26:55.815 --> 26:56.949
You check with the neighbors.

26:57.049 --> 26:58.417
Maybe somebody saw
something suspicious.

26:58.517 --> 27:00.653
All right, on it.

27:02.054 --> 27:04.991
Agent Namazi, tell me
we have made progress

27:05.091 --> 27:06.558
on that vehicle.

27:06.659 --> 27:07.727
Bad news, Admiral.

27:07.827 --> 27:09.295
I haven't been able
to track it.

27:09.395 --> 27:10.697
Yeah, well,
I have more bad news.

27:10.797 --> 27:13.432
Call up the DoD database.

27:13.532 --> 27:14.633
I don't have access
to that database.

27:14.734 --> 27:15.935
You do now.

27:16.035 --> 27:20.172
Enter Hotel 21
Papa Charlie Foxtrot.

27:20.272 --> 27:22.641
Okay.
Claire Winchester?

27:22.742 --> 27:24.476
DoD never came up
when I pulled her name.

27:24.576 --> 27:27.146
That's because she doesn't work
for the Department of Defense.

27:27.246 --> 27:31.083
Dr. Winchester is a professor
at Braddock University

27:31.183 --> 27:33.652
working on a classified
DoD assignment.

27:33.753 --> 27:35.254
With Dr. Howard?

27:35.354 --> 27:37.389
Yes. I've already alerted DCIS.

27:37.489 --> 27:40.727
We have been cleared to continue
our investigation.

27:40.827 --> 27:43.963
They are sending
a chief technology officer

27:44.063 --> 27:45.097
to the boatshed.

27:45.197 --> 27:47.566
They will download Kensi
and Deeks.

27:49.068 --> 27:51.003
An ID just came in
for the dead man.

27:51.103 --> 27:52.739
Oh. Finally getting somewhere.

27:52.839 --> 27:54.606
Okay, his name is Zhang Chin.

27:54.707 --> 27:57.844
He's a Chinese citizen
and U.S. legal resident.

27:57.944 --> 27:59.178
Well, that's damn near impossible

27:59.278 --> 28:01.013
without a government affiliation.

28:01.113 --> 28:03.649
There's also an old
student visa.

28:03.750 --> 28:06.385
He attended Whitley University,
never graduated.

28:06.485 --> 28:08.287
Who sponsored Chin's visa?

28:08.387 --> 28:12.491
Let's see, it's a company
named New Origin Talent.

28:12.591 --> 28:15.027
It's a Chinese talent
recruitment agency.

28:15.127 --> 28:18.164
Yeah, what these programs do is
they lure foreign experts

28:18.264 --> 28:21.400
to bring their talent
and expertise to China,

28:21.500 --> 28:23.803
but they also reward individuals

28:23.903 --> 28:26.338
for stealing proprietary information.

28:26.438 --> 28:29.308
This New Origin is a vector

28:29.408 --> 28:33.045
for intellectual property theft
and espionage.

28:33.145 --> 28:35.281
So they must have found out
what he was working on

28:35.381 --> 28:36.949
and targeted him.

28:37.049 --> 28:41.287
All right, see if we can get
an address for Mr. Zhang Chin.

28:41.387 --> 28:44.323
Maybe that could lead us
to Dr. Winchester.

28:44.423 --> 28:46.125
Yes, sir.

28:48.560 --> 28:50.096
What'd you find?
Not much.

28:50.196 --> 28:52.298
Dr. Winchester's
next-door neighbor said

28:52.398 --> 28:54.233
she heard a scream but
thought it was a squirrel.

28:54.333 --> 28:56.936
The neighbor across
the street has cameras,

28:57.036 --> 28:58.204
but they're pointed
the wrong way.

28:58.304 --> 29:00.807
Anyways, a guy
a couple doors down

29:00.907 --> 29:02.141
did say that he saw
a vehicle

29:02.241 --> 29:03.876
with dark tinted windows
parked outside

29:03.976 --> 29:05.044
he didn't recognize
for a few days.

29:05.144 --> 29:06.545
They might have been
surveilling her.

29:06.645 --> 29:08.480
That explains how they'd know
she'd be home.

29:08.580 --> 29:09.882
You think it was planned?

29:09.982 --> 29:11.217
It seems so. I mean,
they took her laptop.

29:11.317 --> 29:12.885
They knew what they came for. Yeah.

29:12.985 --> 29:15.621
Just like Dr. Howard. Hmm.

29:18.390 --> 29:21.193
I think I might have a way
to find Dr. Winchester.

29:21.293 --> 29:22.428
You recognize this?

29:22.528 --> 29:24.196
Yeah, it's a smartwatch charger.

29:24.296 --> 29:26.132
If it's turned on,
Fatima can ping a location.

29:26.232 --> 29:28.334
After they get
what they want from her,

29:28.434 --> 29:30.102
they may kill her.

29:30.202 --> 29:33.840
We got to find that SUV,
and we got to find it fast.

29:33.940 --> 29:36.608
Kensi, Deeks,

29:36.708 --> 29:38.878
Tom Fields, Chief
Technology Officer.

29:38.978 --> 29:40.146
Great. Thank you, Castor.

29:40.246 --> 29:41.981
Hi. I'm Special Agent
Kensi Blye,

29:42.081 --> 29:43.182
this is my partner
Investigator Deeks. Pleasure.

29:43.282 --> 29:44.516
Pleasure.
Please have a seat.

29:44.616 --> 29:46.118
Thank you.

29:47.753 --> 29:49.388
Agents, I'm here to assist you
with whatever you need.

29:49.488 --> 29:53.159
And thank you for alerting us
to the theft of the moths.

29:54.060 --> 29:56.328
Uh, don't you mean
Dr. Winchester's kidnapping?

29:56.428 --> 29:58.730
Yes, I'm concerned
about Dr. Winchester,

29:58.831 --> 30:00.332
and I'm sorry about what
happened to Dr. Howard,

30:00.432 --> 30:03.569
but right now
the moths are more important.

30:03.669 --> 30:05.037
Why are these moths
so important?

30:05.137 --> 30:07.339
And how is Dr. Howard involved?

30:07.439 --> 30:10.943
Dr. Howard and Dr. Winchester
succeeded in the first

30:11.043 --> 30:13.579
field trial of an insect
modified to control

30:13.679 --> 30:15.181
an agricultural pest.

30:15.281 --> 30:18.684
The project was funded
by the DoD.

30:18.784 --> 30:21.220
So, a genetically
modified moth.

30:21.320 --> 30:24.390
These were high-tech,
virus-carrying moths.

30:24.490 --> 30:26.993
They could potentially end
the need for pesticides.

30:27.093 --> 30:28.961
Which is a great thing, right?

30:29.061 --> 30:31.397
In the wrong hands,
the technique could be used

30:31.497 --> 30:33.365
by malicious actors
to help spread diseases

30:33.465 --> 30:37.836
to almost any crop species,
devastating harvests.

30:37.937 --> 30:39.705
Which is why they took
Dr. Winchester,

30:39.805 --> 30:42.541
to replicate the results
and modify the moth.

30:42.641 --> 30:44.043
That's biowarfare.

30:44.143 --> 30:47.046
Once released, insects are
difficult to control.

30:47.146 --> 30:49.715
And if they're released here,
in America,

30:49.815 --> 30:51.450
they'll reproduce.

30:51.550 --> 30:55.554
And by summer, half of America's
food supply could be gone.

30:55.654 --> 30:59.458
I guess that answers why
the moths were so important.

30:59.558 --> 31:02.228
One of the men that kidnapped
Dr. Winchester,

31:02.328 --> 31:04.730
he was working for
a Chinese recruitment agency.

31:04.830 --> 31:06.598
How would
the Chinese government

31:06.698 --> 31:08.267
even know about the moths?

31:08.367 --> 31:09.902
Was anyone else working
on the project?

31:10.002 --> 31:12.404
No. Dr. Howard's lab was
a cleared facility.

31:12.504 --> 31:15.541
And his lab assistant was
granted access to

31:15.641 --> 31:17.409
projects, materials and data.

31:17.509 --> 31:19.045
Okay, that doesn't track,
though, 'cause

31:19.145 --> 31:20.046
Dr. Howard's assistant
claimed he didn't know

31:20.146 --> 31:21.180
what the moths were for.

31:21.280 --> 31:22.748
I can't see how that's possible.

31:22.848 --> 31:24.116
Why?

31:24.216 --> 31:26.485
Dr Howard worked
very closely with his assistant.

31:26.585 --> 31:27.987
He trusts Arjun.

31:28.087 --> 31:30.489
Well, it looks like Sam's
gonna have to have

31:30.589 --> 31:33.059
another conversation with Arjun.

31:33.159 --> 31:34.793
Where are we with
Arjun's emails?

31:34.893 --> 31:37.029
Nothing so far.

31:37.129 --> 31:40.432
All right, pull in Sam
and Rountree.

31:40.532 --> 31:41.867
What do you got, Fatima?

31:41.968 --> 31:43.669
Okay, so there's nothing
really connecting Arjun

31:43.769 --> 31:45.972
to New Origin or Zhang Chin.

31:46.072 --> 31:47.606
No emails, no text messages.

31:47.706 --> 31:50.609
Okay, maybe Arjun was
telling the truth. Right?

31:50.709 --> 31:53.045
So Howard's wife said that
he was extremely paranoid,

31:53.145 --> 31:54.280
so maybe he never told Arjun

31:54.380 --> 31:55.847
what the moths
were actually for.

31:55.948 --> 31:57.883
Arjun claimed to know
that lab inside and out.

31:57.984 --> 31:59.418
He would've known
they were being used

31:59.518 --> 32:01.753
for a classified project, but
instead he played ignorant.

32:01.853 --> 32:04.356
Arjun's bank records
just came through.

32:04.456 --> 32:06.392
Hmm, not very much
in his account.

32:06.492 --> 32:08.127
Yeah, the university
should really

32:08.227 --> 32:09.661
pay their lab assistants better.

32:09.761 --> 32:11.530
Well, if Arjun is being paid
by a Chinese company,

32:11.630 --> 32:13.199
maybe they're sending it
via wire transfer.

32:13.299 --> 32:14.700
Something like Western Union?

32:14.800 --> 32:16.902
Has he recently transferred
any money into his account?

32:17.003 --> 32:19.205
Uh, yes, actually.

32:19.305 --> 32:21.740
Last month he transferred
$5K into his account

32:21.840 --> 32:23.009
from Nomportacoin.

32:23.109 --> 32:24.943
It's a crypto exchange account.

32:25.044 --> 32:26.112
Can you access that account?

32:26.212 --> 32:27.513
He may be keeping
a balance there.

32:27.613 --> 32:30.349
Bingo. There's about $30K
in the account.

32:30.449 --> 32:31.950
He's been receiving
weekly deposits

32:32.051 --> 32:33.519
for the last three months.

32:33.619 --> 32:35.387
But not from New Origin.

32:35.487 --> 32:38.357
These payments are coming
from a stateside company:

32:38.457 --> 32:39.825
Flow Genis.

32:39.925 --> 32:41.627
Dr. Howard had a loan-out
company with a business name

32:41.727 --> 32:44.730
for all of his
speaking engagement income.

32:44.830 --> 32:46.665
Maybe Arjun did the same?

32:46.765 --> 32:50.002
Oh, yeah, Flow Genis is a corp
connected to Arjun.

32:50.102 --> 32:51.937
He's been using crypto
to cover up

32:52.038 --> 32:54.073
the money he's receiving
from New Origin.

32:54.173 --> 32:56.408
Find him.
Arjun lied to us.

32:56.508 --> 32:58.610
And to Dr. Howard.

33:10.856 --> 33:12.858
It's over, Arjun.

33:34.113 --> 33:36.248
All right, let's make this easy, Arjun.

33:36.348 --> 33:38.150
We know you lied to us.

33:38.250 --> 33:41.420
The pesticides weren't missing,
and you knew about the moths.

33:41.520 --> 33:43.455
Now help us find Dr. Winchester.

33:43.555 --> 33:45.023
I already told you.

33:45.124 --> 33:47.726
I have no idea
where they're taking her.

33:47.826 --> 33:49.128
This was not part of the plan.

33:49.228 --> 33:52.364
All right, Arjun,
walk us through the plan.

33:52.464 --> 33:54.333
They paid me to give them
first looks

33:54.433 --> 33:55.767
at Dr. Howard's research.

33:55.867 --> 33:57.203
So if you gave 'em
Dr Howard's research,

33:57.303 --> 33:59.138
then why did they break in
and attack him?

34:01.006 --> 34:02.874
Dr. Howard wouldn't cooperate.

34:02.974 --> 34:04.610
He knew you were working
with New Origin?

34:04.710 --> 34:07.813
I told him I had been approached
by New Origin

34:07.913 --> 34:10.082
to receive a huge grant
for our lab.

34:10.182 --> 34:12.084
But Dr. Howard knew he was
developing the moths

34:12.184 --> 34:14.453
for the DoD, and they could
be dangerous.

34:14.553 --> 34:16.888
And you decided to
help them steal it.

34:16.988 --> 34:21.527
No. I thought in time
I could convince Dr. Howard

34:21.627 --> 34:23.529
that there was no harm
in taking the money.

34:23.629 --> 34:26.265
Arjun, they could weaponize
that technology

34:26.365 --> 34:27.833
and use it against us.

34:28.834 --> 34:31.637
Are you aware that you're in
violation of the Patriot Act,

34:31.737 --> 34:35.006
and what you did
amounts to treason?

34:36.007 --> 34:37.209
Treason?

34:37.309 --> 34:38.910
Treason.

34:40.179 --> 34:43.749
So I'm gonna ask you
one more time, Arjun,

34:43.849 --> 34:46.885
where are they taking her?

34:50.256 --> 34:53.091
There's a lab in Shanghai.

34:55.294 --> 34:57.229
Hey.

34:57.329 --> 35:00.832
Fatima, did you find a location
on Dr. Winchester's smartwatch?

35:00.932 --> 35:03.302
Yeah, I picked up a signal,
but it's intermittent.

35:03.402 --> 35:05.437
She's headed south on the 405,

35:05.537 --> 35:07.406
but they could have
exited by now.

35:07.506 --> 35:09.007
Kaleidoscope's trying
to track 'em.

35:09.107 --> 35:11.109
All right, Arjun said they could
be taking her to Shanghai.

35:11.210 --> 35:13.011
There's three airports
on the Westside.

35:13.111 --> 35:15.046
They may be trying to
smuggle her out of the country.

35:15.147 --> 35:18.550
New Origin has a private jet
at the Santa Monica Airport.

35:18.650 --> 35:20.719
And they just headed west
on the 10.

35:20.819 --> 35:22.321
If they get her out
of the country,

35:22.421 --> 35:23.589
we'll never get her back.

35:23.689 --> 35:24.523
Tell Kensi and Deeks
to meet us there.

35:24.623 --> 35:27.025
On it.

35:29.861 --> 35:32.030
We're not far behind them.
We got to go.

35:34.466 --> 35:37.203
Guys, Kaleidoscope has them
exiting the freeway at Bundy.

35:37.303 --> 35:38.670
And they're headed south.

35:38.770 --> 35:40.206
We're close by, Fatima.

35:46.245 --> 35:48.046
They just made a right
on Ocean Park.

35:48.980 --> 35:50.682
We may be able
to cut 'em off.

36:02.394 --> 36:04.830
I see 'em.

36:08.667 --> 36:10.836
Out of the car!

36:10.936 --> 36:12.738
Wait, wait, wait.

36:12.838 --> 36:14.406
Winchester could be in there.
Fatima, can you shut

36:14.506 --> 36:15.807
that engine down?

36:15.907 --> 36:17.676
See, the SUV should have
anti-theft technology.

36:17.776 --> 36:19.911
I'll alert the vehicle
security services.

36:21.380 --> 36:22.981
Guys, we're coming up behind.

36:30.088 --> 36:31.690
It's coming at us.
Shut it down now.

36:31.790 --> 36:33.725
They're working on it.

36:38.330 --> 36:40.065
It's been disabled.

36:42.368 --> 36:45.571
Out of the car!
Hands up. Hands up.

36:45.671 --> 36:46.872
Get out of the car.

36:46.972 --> 36:50.309
Get out of the car.
Hands up! Hands up!

36:55.381 --> 36:56.848
Oh, my God.

36:56.948 --> 36:58.684
Hey, hey, you're okay.
All right, all right.

36:58.784 --> 37:00.519
It's okay.

37:00.619 --> 37:02.087
All right, you're safe now.
You're okay.

37:02.187 --> 37:07.025
Yes. Guys, we have
recovered the moths.

37:07.125 --> 37:10.996
Repeat, the moths
have been recovered.

37:12.398 --> 37:14.333
All right.

37:14.433 --> 37:16.234
Just breathe.

37:25.577 --> 37:27.112
What is this?

37:27.212 --> 37:29.681
You murdered flowers
just for me?

37:29.781 --> 37:31.717
Those flowers were already
dead when I bought them.

37:31.817 --> 37:33.285
I got no blood on my hands.

37:33.385 --> 37:34.986
Well, that's
very romantic of you.

37:35.086 --> 37:36.488
Yeah, that's because
I'm Mr. Romance,

37:36.588 --> 37:39.791
even though you spent
the whole day doubting me.

37:39.891 --> 37:41.760
And I am mildly offended,

37:41.860 --> 37:44.029
but you do have to
answer this question.

37:44.129 --> 37:46.465
"Will you go on a date with me?"

37:46.565 --> 37:47.733
And then I put a little box

37:47.833 --> 37:48.900
where you have to check
yes or no.

37:49.000 --> 37:51.503
Yes.
Oh, yes.

37:51.603 --> 37:52.838
With a big heart.

37:52.938 --> 37:54.840
Yes!

37:54.940 --> 37:56.207
Back right pocket.

37:56.308 --> 37:58.310
You want me to pull something
from your pocket?

37:58.410 --> 37:59.711
My back right pocket.

37:59.811 --> 38:00.712
Your right or my right?

38:00.812 --> 38:03.014
My right.
My right.

38:04.182 --> 38:05.116
Get in there.
Take what's yours.

38:05.216 --> 38:07.152
Okay, wait. I'm so sorry. Ooh...

38:07.252 --> 38:08.820
Tip your waiter.

38:10.155 --> 38:11.590
Okay, this looks like
something I haven't seen

38:11.690 --> 38:13.191
since middle school.
Yeah, well.

38:13.291 --> 38:17.262
"Will you be my girlfriend?"

38:17.363 --> 38:19.064
Yes.

38:19.164 --> 38:21.700
But also because that's
the only answer you gave me.

38:21.800 --> 38:23.301
Back left pocket.

38:23.402 --> 38:24.870
There's more?
Take your time.

38:24.970 --> 38:26.304
Take your time.
Really earn it.

38:26.405 --> 38:29.775
Ooh, God, that's--
We're gonna get fired. HR.

38:29.875 --> 38:31.377
Oh, my gosh.

38:31.477 --> 38:33.479
Gregory Alan Isakov
at the Terrace Theater?

38:33.579 --> 38:34.880
Are you serious?

38:34.980 --> 38:36.314
I know that we have
so much on our plate,

38:36.415 --> 38:39.317
but the last thing
I want to do is lose this.

38:39.418 --> 38:43.722
I don't want to lose
the thing that got us here.

38:43.822 --> 38:46.191
Although, full honesty,

38:46.291 --> 38:49.060
you rockin' those
torn-up Levis

38:49.160 --> 38:50.596
was a big part of our thing.

38:50.696 --> 38:52.531
Yeah, why do you think
I wore 'em on every single date?

38:52.631 --> 38:54.866
Yeah, well, they worked.

39:00.171 --> 39:03.141
This feels like ten years ago.

39:04.142 --> 39:06.812
Yeah.

39:08.113 --> 39:10.682
I don't want to lose that spark.

I'm gonna call Mama Deeks,
and I'm gonna tell her

39:29.735 --> 39:34.205
that we need a babysitter
for a standing date night.

39:34.305 --> 39:36.808
You better make that call
pretty fast.

39:36.908 --> 39:39.745
She's on speed dial, so...

39:40.546 --> 39:43.415
Mama Deeks, we're gonna need you

39:45.817 --> 39:48.253
Or Sunday morning

39:48.353 --> 39:49.721
What? Oh.

39:49.821 --> 39:52.524
Let me get that for you,
Mrs. Deeks.
Oh, thank you.

39:52.624 --> 39:54.793
No, yeah, no, there's
nothing back there anymore,

I spoke with Director Fields.

40:10.408 --> 40:12.678
Dr. Winchester
has been released.

40:12.778 --> 40:14.613
Just some cuts and bruises,

40:14.713 --> 40:16.715
and very happy
that all the moths

40:16.815 --> 40:18.049
have been accounted for.

40:18.149 --> 40:20.351
Hunting down bugs.

40:20.452 --> 40:23.221
All my years as an agent,
this is a first.

40:23.321 --> 40:25.023
Well, that's what I've come
to love about this job.

40:25.123 --> 40:26.758
Every day is something unexpected.

40:26.858 --> 40:28.126
Keeps you on your toes,
you know?

40:28.226 --> 40:29.495
That is true. Yeah.

40:29.595 --> 40:31.429
And about me taking over
the reins of your office

40:31.530 --> 40:33.832
when you're away...
Yes, about that.

40:33.932 --> 40:37.068
I received this when
I took over the job.

40:37.168 --> 40:39.838
I always assumed that
Henrietta sent it,

40:39.938 --> 40:41.673
although she would
never admit it.

40:41.773 --> 40:45.911
And I was not exactly
head over heels at the idea of

40:46.011 --> 40:48.714
working with a bunch of misfits
who thought that

40:48.814 --> 40:52.618
daily meditation should be
a part of the employee handbook.

40:52.718 --> 40:57.856
But Henrietta evidently knew
this office needed me

40:57.956 --> 41:02.594
and probably thought
I needed it, too.

41:03.929 --> 41:05.430
Now, you don't open
that envelope

41:05.531 --> 41:08.199
till you're sure
you want to take this job.

41:08.299 --> 41:10.669
You know, in the past
I would have

41:10.769 --> 41:13.138
given you a flat-out no.

41:13.238 --> 41:15.406
But my life has evolved
into something that

41:15.507 --> 41:18.043
I barely even recognize.

41:18.143 --> 41:20.478
I think it's time
for me to reevaluate

41:20.579 --> 41:23.882
where I want to go,
how I want to get there.

41:23.982 --> 41:25.551
You mean setting goals.

41:25.651 --> 41:26.852
Ah, I wouldn't call it that.

41:26.952 --> 41:29.621
More like conscientious objectives.

41:29.721 --> 41:31.189
Tomato, to-mah-to.

41:31.289 --> 41:33.792
But let me know what you decide
as soon as you can.

41:33.892 --> 41:36.361
I want to be able to leave
at a moment's notice,

41:36.461 --> 41:39.097
and somebody has to do
this godforsaken job.

41:39.197 --> 41:40.999
Well, you make it sound
so fun, Admiral.

41:41.099 --> 41:45.270
I will give you an answer
very soon.

41:45.370 --> 41:48.506
Thank you.
And, uh, Agent Hanna,

41:48.607 --> 41:50.776
no matter what you decide,
just remember,

41:50.876 --> 41:54.145
it is never too late
to explore other pathways.

41:54.245 --> 41:58.717
Something I'm happy to say
I learned from my son.

41:58.817 --> 42:02.187
Apparently you can teach
an old dog new tricks.

42:29.514 --> 42:32.317
You haven't got me yet, Hetty.
