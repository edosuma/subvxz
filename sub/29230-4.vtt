Your mom is really into this wedding.

00:14.055 --> 00:15.098
Maybe there's a compromise.

-I'm good with whatever you want.
-You mean it?

Hasn't changed, has it, since we got married here?

-Simon, I--
SIMON: I knew you were unhappy, Bree.

And it would hurt me too much
to know that I was responsible.

BREE:
The <i>USS Kelsey </i> is no more.

Sunk by a torpedo of irony.

After 53 years, the set of <i>The Good Ship Forever</i>

Hey, at least it wasn't termites.

00:45.670 --> 00:47.797
I sign on to be producer of the school play,

00:49.924 --> 00:52.927
-Most romantic movie ever.
-You realize it doesn't end well, right?

00:53.011 --> 00:56.431
Yeah, before the whole iceberg thing, it's true love.

Look at all the names of all the students
writing them on the sets.

-They're all gonna be thrown away.
-Ooh!

01:02.729 --> 01:06.357
I remember when I was cast in the school play.
I was so happy.

01:06.441 --> 01:08.276
Well, right now, I'm stupidly happy

01:08.359 --> 01:10.987
because I just rewrote the ending of my play.

01:11.071 --> 01:14.657
Wait, is stupidly happy a thing
like stupidly beautiful?

01:14.741 --> 01:19.329
Yeah, and didn't you just break up
with Simon last week? Shouldn't you be less...

01:19.412 --> 01:20.955
-Stupidly happy?
ABBY: Yeah.

01:21.039 --> 01:24.751
And didn't you also say
that your original ending was perfect

01:24.834 --> 01:26.795
and that Jace and Melanie

01:26.878 --> 01:30.465
"were bound together by the past,
but hopeful for a love

01:30.548 --> 01:33.176
-that would last forever."
-"Last forever."

01:34.177 --> 01:35.345
I love happy endings.

01:35.428 --> 01:37.722
ABBY: Have you seen the ending?
-Which is the best part.

01:37.806 --> 01:41.893
Because it's realistic, it's sad, it's depressing.

01:41.976 --> 01:43.144
Just like my play now,

01:43.228 --> 01:46.606
where Jace and Melanie realize
that eventually love fades,

01:46.689 --> 01:47.899
and so must they.

01:47.982 --> 01:49.526
That's not happy at all.

it usually is.

we just start all over again.

I honestly don't care about Bauhaus

It's just-- This place is truly ours.

I wouldn't even want my parents there.

as a personal floatation device.
