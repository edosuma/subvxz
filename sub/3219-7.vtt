36:08.916 --> 36:12.085
Tomorrow. November 2nd.

36:12.420 --> 36:15.547
-It's an anniversary for you, right?
-What are you doing here?

36:16.174 --> 36:18.383
It's the day Azazel killed your mother.

36:18.551 --> 36:20.886
Then, 22 years later, your girlfriend too.

36:21.554 --> 36:23.263
Must be difficult to bear.

36:23.431 --> 36:26.057
Yet, you brazenly use
the power he gave you.

36:26.225 --> 36:28.768
His profane blood
pumping through your veins.

36:28.936 --> 36:32.063
-Excuse me?
-You were told not to use your abilities.

36:32.231 --> 36:33.732
What was I supposed to do?

36:34.317 --> 36:38.612
That demon would've killed me,
and my brother, and everyone.

36:38.779 --> 36:42.073
You were told not to.

36:42.241 --> 36:44.326
If Samhain had gotten loose in this town--

36:44.493 --> 36:47.120
You've been warned twice now.

36:47.288 --> 36:50.498
You know,
my brother was right about you.

36:50.791 --> 36:52.417
You are dicks.

36:59.800 --> 37:02.302
The only reason you're still alive,
Sam Winchester...

37:02.470 --> 37:04.095
...is because you've been useful.

37:04.263 --> 37:06.264
But the moment that ceases to be true...

37:06.432 --> 37:11.144
...the second you become more trouble
than you're worth, one word-- One.

37:11.312 --> 37:13.605
--and I will turn you to dust.

37:19.320 --> 37:20.779
As for your brother...

37:20.947 --> 37:24.616
...tell him that maybe he should
climb off that high horse of his.

37:25.326 --> 37:29.829
Ask Dean what he remembers from hell.

37:52.853 --> 37:56.690
Let me guess.
You're here for the "I told you so."

37:56.857 --> 37:58.149
No.

37:58.317 --> 38:00.652
Well, good,
because I'm really not that interested.

38:01.487 --> 38:03.196
I'm not here to judge you, Dean.

38:03.781 --> 38:05.407
Then why are you here?

38:06.993 --> 38:09.703
-Our orders--
-Yeah, I've had enough of these orders.

38:09.870 --> 38:14.374
Our orders were not to stop
the summoning of Samhain.

38:14.542 --> 38:16.793
They were to do
whatever you told us to do.

38:20.047 --> 38:22.340
Your orders were to follow my orders?

38:23.384 --> 38:25.552
It was a test...

38:26.012 --> 38:31.725
...to see how you would perform under
battlefield conditions, you might say.

38:35.187 --> 38:39.232
It was a witch, not the Tet Offensive.

38:42.528 --> 38:45.238
So I failed your test, huh?

38:45.406 --> 38:47.324
I get it.

38:48.034 --> 38:49.951
But you know what?

38:52.330 --> 38:56.082
If you were to wave that magic
time-traveling wand of yours...

38:56.250 --> 38:59.627
...and we had to do it all over again,
I'd make the same call.

39:02.048 --> 39:04.924
I don't know what's gonna happen
when these seals are broken.

39:05.092 --> 39:07.427
Hell, I don't know
what's gonna happen tomorrow.

39:07.595 --> 39:10.430
But what I do know is that this here...

39:11.140 --> 39:15.060
...these kids, the swings, the trees...

39:15.227 --> 39:19.356
...all of it is still here
because of my brother and me.

39:21.859 --> 39:23.401
You misunderstand me, Dean.

39:23.569 --> 39:27.405
I'm not like you think. I was praying
that you would choose to save the town.

39:27.573 --> 39:28.948
You were?

39:29.116 --> 39:35.789
These people,
they are all my father's creations.

39:36.374 --> 39:38.249
They are works of art.

39:39.460 --> 39:43.421
And yet, even though you
stopped Samhain, the seal was broken.

39:43.589 --> 39:47.425
And we are one step closer
to hell on Earth for all creation.

39:47.593 --> 39:51.096
And that's not an expression,
Dean. It's literal.

39:52.306 --> 39:55.683
You, of all people,
should appreciate what that means.

40:00.147 --> 40:03.483
Can I tell you something
if you promise not to tell another soul?

40:03.651 --> 40:04.818
Okay.

40:04.985 --> 40:10.657
I'm not a hammer, as you say.

40:12.159 --> 40:14.327
I have questions. I....

40:15.162 --> 40:17.330
I have doubts.

40:18.541 --> 40:23.336
I don't know what is right
and what is wrong anymore...

40:23.921 --> 40:25.797
...whether you passed or failed here.

40:27.800 --> 40:33.138
But in the coming months
you will have more decisions to make.

40:33.806 --> 40:37.225
I don't envy the weight
that's on your shoulders, Dean.

40:39.812 --> 40:42.021
I truly don't.
