00:07.341 --> 00:10.342
         - It's funny.
   They warned me about you.

00:10.344 --> 00:12.678
  Upstairs said, "manage him.

00:12.680 --> 00:15.080
           "use him.
       Keep him in line.

00:15.082 --> 00:18.150
    And as soon as you start
  to lose him, take him down."

00:18.152 --> 00:20.185
        But they didn't
     do you justice, hank.

00:20.187 --> 00:22.588
   - They set you up to fail.

00:22.590 --> 00:24.256
    - No, I don't think so.

00:24.258 --> 00:26.191
      They know this place
     needs a guy like you,

00:26.193 --> 00:29.094
  As long as he's controlled.

00:29.096 --> 00:31.196
  But now you're an experiment
       gone wrong, hank,

00:31.198 --> 00:33.365
  And they're gonna find a way
         to break you.

00:33.367 --> 00:35.567
     You might as well know
         that's coming.

00:35.569 --> 00:38.437
      - Hmm. And you'll be
      there to watch, huh?

00:38.439 --> 00:41.140
      - No, probably not.

00:41.142 --> 00:43.475
   But I'll hear about it...

00:43.477 --> 00:46.512
            And know
  somewhere I'll be laughing.

            [groans]
           - wake up.

01:24.284 --> 01:26.085
           You came.

01:41.468 --> 01:44.703
         - What exactly
      do you want, nadia?

01:49.275 --> 01:52.544
      If you can't say it,
    it's never gonna happen.

01:52.546 --> 01:55.514
          - I called.
        - Yes, you did.

01:55.516 --> 01:59.351
       But then you tied
    a tube around your arm.

01:59.353 --> 02:01.487
         - I want out.

02:01.489 --> 02:05.290
        - Then you have
         to get clean.

02:09.329 --> 02:11.663
           - [sighs]

02:11.665 --> 02:13.432
            - Yeah?

02:13.434 --> 02:15.167
            - Yeah.

02:15.169 --> 02:17.402
              Yes.

02:17.404 --> 02:19.805
            - Okay.

02:19.807 --> 02:22.841
   I'm gonna make some calls
  and get you into a facility,

02:22.843 --> 02:24.776
       But it's probably
  gonna take me a day or two,

02:24.778 --> 02:28.380
      So you're gonna stay
    at my place, all right?

02:28.382 --> 02:30.349
            - Um...

02:33.620 --> 02:37.523
    Could you just make sure
 I actually walk in this time?

02:39.359 --> 02:41.493
         - You got it.

02:44.764 --> 02:47.299
           - Thanks.

02:51.371 --> 02:54.306

02:59.246 --> 03:00.646
    - What do you got, jin?

03:00.648 --> 03:02.381
     - That lonnie rodiger
          credit card

03:02.383 --> 03:04.249
    You wanted me to track.

03:04.251 --> 03:06.251
         Just got a hit
   from a toy store downtown.

03:06.253 --> 03:08.320
     - Text me the address.

          Go for jay.

03:31.545 --> 03:33.345
        - Where you at?

03:33.347 --> 03:35.280
        - On my way in.
      - Head to chinatown.

03:35.282 --> 03:38.350
    Sending you the address.

03:38.352 --> 03:40.419
         - You got it.

      [indistinct chatter]

03:56.269 --> 03:58.370
          - Let's go.

04:06.346 --> 04:09.581
         Triad casino.

04:09.583 --> 04:12.751
        - A lot of money
      rolls through here.

04:12.753 --> 04:15.554
      - You feeling lucky?

04:20.726 --> 04:22.794
      - Luckier than them.

04:33.606 --> 04:35.874
          - Over here.

04:41.814 --> 04:44.716
          They killed
    the damn errand boy too.

04:54.761 --> 04:54.993
               .

04:54.995 --> 04:56.361

       They were startled
          by the kid.

05:02.670 --> 05:04.369
      - Weapons, uniforms.

05:04.371 --> 05:06.371
     - Military, for sure.

05:06.373 --> 05:07.406
      These guys are pros.

05:07.408 --> 05:08.707
            - I want
         a copy of this

05:08.709 --> 05:12.711
   In the intelligence office
      before we get back.

05:16.082 --> 05:18.984
      - All right, this is
 an illegal triad gambling den.

05:18.986 --> 05:20.752
     It's one of two dozen
        that vice thinks

05:20.754 --> 05:22.354
   They operate in the area.

05:22.356 --> 05:23.955
           Problem is
     they tend to shut down

05:23.957 --> 05:25.390
           And pop up
    somewhere else quickly.

05:25.392 --> 05:27.959
   - Who's their competition?
         - Cermak crew.

05:27.961 --> 05:31.363
      On the illegal lotto
      in the neighborhood.

05:31.365 --> 05:33.932
         And the triads
     take the bigger cash.

05:33.934 --> 05:35.500
       - This cermak crew
  looking for a bigger piece?

05:35.502 --> 05:36.702
     - Yeah, they could be.

05:36.704 --> 05:39.338
   - All right, it's a start.

05:39.340 --> 05:41.406
   Where's olinsky and ruzek?

05:41.408 --> 05:43.642
   - Coming in from the cold.

05:43.644 --> 05:46.111
- Well, I understand the concept
     of sunglasses, ruzek,

05:46.113 --> 05:47.612
       But it looks like
    you're trying too hard.

05:47.614 --> 05:48.947
     You're supposed to be
       from the streets.

05:48.949 --> 05:50.716
 - Why don't you quit worrying
        about what I'm--

05:50.718 --> 05:52.417
      - Olinsky, where are
     your non-suit reports?

05:52.419 --> 05:54.353
  - Uh, haven't had the time.

05:54.355 --> 05:55.854
        - I'm going up.
       - Well, make time.

05:55.856 --> 05:57.022
   - Hey, hey, look at ruzek.

05:57.024 --> 05:59.057
           - [laughs]

05:59.059 --> 06:01.426
      Gutierrez, you still
 carrying maloney on your back?

06:01.428 --> 06:02.661
 - Hey, I'm used to it by now.

06:02.663 --> 06:04.563
          - Up yours.
      How are you, buddy?

06:04.565 --> 06:06.465
        Good to see you.
           - You too.

06:06.467 --> 06:08.367
          - Those are
   some sweet shades, ruzek.

06:08.369 --> 06:09.768
   - All right, gentle, man.
             Easy.

06:09.770 --> 06:11.103
         - Hey, so how
        is it here, man?

06:11.105 --> 06:13.438
 We're hoping after graduation,
       this is our spot.

06:13.440 --> 06:15.407
    - Yeah, I don't know how
 it is for the patrolmen here.

06:15.409 --> 06:17.109
            I mean,
      I skipped that part.

06:17.111 --> 06:18.777
      - Yeah, so we heard.

06:18.779 --> 06:20.879
- Yeah, put in your time, boys.
       That's my advice.

06:20.881 --> 06:23.115
       Then maybe you too
  can join us upstairs, right?

06:23.117 --> 06:25.984
        - You know what?
      That is good advice.

06:25.986 --> 06:27.819
     Come here. Come here.
         - Duty calls.

06:27.821 --> 06:29.654
  Let's get a drink sometime.
       - Definitely, man.

06:29.656 --> 06:31.656
    - Say, sergeant platt...

06:31.658 --> 06:35.427
        Ruzek here needs
 to better appreciate the, uh--

06:35.429 --> 06:38.797
          The journey
  that he, uh, got to bypass.

06:40.099 --> 06:42.467
    - Oh, I've been waiting
         for this day.

06:44.070 --> 06:46.571
      - I appreciate this,
    detective olinsky, sir.

06:46.573 --> 06:48.173
       - Don't sweat it,
 just put your plain clothes on

06:48.175 --> 06:52.677
          - Yes, sir.
       - Ah, there he is.

06:52.679 --> 06:55.847
    Look at you, all sharp.

06:55.849 --> 06:58.183
     Where are the shades?
          - How long?

06:58.185 --> 07:00.452
    - We'll play it by ear.
        [clicks tongue]

07:00.454 --> 07:02.421
           All right?

07:09.162 --> 07:12.197
    - Well, this is awkward.
    - Oh, tell me about it.

07:12.199 --> 07:13.999
         - Burgess, you
     and special sauce here

07:14.001 --> 07:16.134
   Will be doing foot patrol
  at ron goodwin high school.

07:16.136 --> 07:19.471
 - Great. Thank you, sergeant.
       - You're welcome.

07:19.473 --> 07:21.473
   - Aka crossing-guard duty.

07:21.475 --> 07:24.075
           - Perfect.

07:24.077 --> 07:26.978
 Tight inside the cermak crew.
           - Uh-huh.

07:26.980 --> 07:29.147
 - He said they're making money
 hand over fist on the lottery

07:29.149 --> 07:30.882
     And have no incentive
     to take on the triads.

07:30.884 --> 07:33.151
         - We both know
 if someone in the cermak crew

07:33.153 --> 07:34.786
 Feels up a triad's girlfriend,

07:34.788 --> 07:36.087
 Economics goes out the window.

07:36.089 --> 07:38.156
- I'd have heard of it, voight.
           Trust me.

07:38.158 --> 07:39.825
      Now, no one's happy
          about this.

07:39.827 --> 07:42.627
   Bad business for everyone.
- Sells a lot of papers, though.

07:42.629 --> 07:45.096
 - A better story will be when
 you find out who's doing this.

07:45.098 --> 07:47.532
      I want an exclusive.
        - Oh. [chuckles]

07:47.534 --> 07:51.736
  Just keep my name out of it.
           - [laughs]

07:54.106 --> 07:56.908
       - Sergeant voight.

07:56.910 --> 07:58.577
        It's a pleasure
          to meet you.

07:58.579 --> 08:01.146
   I'm edwin stillwell, I.A.

08:01.148 --> 08:02.714
   I'll be taking over your--

08:02.716 --> 08:05.183
     Well, I'll be working
     with you from now on,

08:05.185 --> 08:07.152
    Now that miss gradishar
     is no longer with us.

08:07.154 --> 08:09.120
- Look, you want to talk to me?
       You call me first.

08:09.122 --> 08:10.856
        Don't ambush me
         in the street.

08:10.858 --> 08:12.557
- See, it's words like "ambush"

08:12.559 --> 08:14.092
  That get things started off
       on the wrong foot.

08:14.094 --> 08:17.028
   Now, I came here with what
I hope will be a fresh approach,

08:17.030 --> 08:18.864
     One that might get us
        better results--

08:18.866 --> 08:20.899
  A partnership, if you will.

08:20.901 --> 08:23.034
           - Uh-huh.

08:24.136 --> 08:26.171
        - Maurice owens.
         - Here we go.

08:26.173 --> 08:28.006
         - My notes say
    that you told gradishar

08:28.008 --> 08:29.608
   That he would be arrested
     in a couple of weeks.

08:29.610 --> 08:31.009
      And now here we are
        on month three.

08:31.011 --> 08:32.977
  - Yeah, well, what gradishar
       didn't understand

08:32.980 --> 08:36.881
   Without him or anyone else
       knowing it was me.

08:36.884 --> 08:39.083
 That kind of work doesn't fit
     neatly on a calendar.

08:39.086 --> 08:41.653
            - Okay.

08:41.655 --> 08:44.289
      Well, I'm gonna need
     more than lip service.

08:47.693 --> 08:49.995
        - Anything else?

08:49.997 --> 08:52.030
            - Nope.

08:52.032 --> 08:55.133
      Keep me in the loop.
  Like I said, "partnership."

08:57.203 --> 08:59.571
        [whistle blows]

08:59.573 --> 09:01.840
   - This is complete horse--
        [whistle blows]

09:01.842 --> 09:03.909
        - That's 'cause
     you're doing it wrong.

09:03.911 --> 09:05.744
          - Oh, yeah?
            - Yeah.

09:05.746 --> 09:09.047
    You got to get your hips
      into it, like this.

09:12.685 --> 09:14.219
  - You're kind of full of it,
         you know that?

09:14.221 --> 09:16.888
            - Am I?
     Or am I awesome at it?

09:20.860 --> 09:22.627
          - This okay?
            - Yeah.

09:22.629 --> 09:24.262
   As long as you don't wear
  those cool-daddy sunglasses,

09:24.264 --> 09:27.766
        You'll be fine.

09:27.768 --> 09:30.302
           - Atwater.

09:30.304 --> 09:32.003
             Yeah?

09:32.005 --> 09:33.672
      - Question for you.
             - Huh?

09:33.674 --> 09:35.640
        - How many cards
 you given out over the years?

09:35.642 --> 09:38.777
    - And how many came back
      and asked for help?

09:38.779 --> 09:40.312
            - Three.
              Why?

09:40.314 --> 09:43.949
            - Okay.
    Party people, listen up.

09:43.951 --> 09:45.317
          I went back
   seven days and downloaded

09:45.319 --> 09:47.185
        All in-progress
       and service calls

09:47.187 --> 09:49.220
       In close proximity
     to the chinatown quad.

09:49.222 --> 09:51.189
       We got three calls
    on suspicious vehicles.

09:51.191 --> 09:53.258
       I ran the plates.

09:53.260 --> 09:56.127
         Legit, legit,
but the third came back a ghost.

09:56.129 --> 09:58.263
        I put that plate

      Exercise your right
         to fight this.

25:39.272 --> 25:41.772

    here down to your office

26:15.775 --> 26:17.274
      And show her, uh...

26:17.276 --> 26:19.643

      This way, detective.

26:29.721 --> 26:31.255

26:31.257 --> 26:35.092
 We got a four-man robbery crew
impersonating jimmy's vice unit,

      As soon as they know
         jimmy's left.

26:42.268 --> 26:44.201
  - That's right, so we should
     use that against them.

26:44.203 --> 26:46.337
  Jimmy, why don't we have you
         and your team

26:46.339 --> 26:49.173
      With olinsky and me
       acting as bankers?

26:49.175 --> 26:51.775
         You guys radio
       amongst each other

26:51.777 --> 26:53.611
        You got 200,000
       from some new den,

26:53.613 --> 26:55.779
         And they're in
   the process of banding it.

26:55.781 --> 26:57.348
  - Right. Once we're inside,
           we put out

26:57.350 --> 27:00.017
       A fraudulent 10-1,
 officer-needs-assistance call,

27:00.019 --> 27:01.952
     And you guys radio in,
   aborting your surveillance

27:01.954 --> 27:02.987
    To respond to the call.

27:02.989 --> 27:04.154
      - And then we wait.

27:04.156 --> 27:06.290
   - Yeah, with a sticky net.

27:06.292 --> 27:08.626
        We tie this crew
    to the other robberies,

27:08.628 --> 27:10.260
    We put 'em away forever.

27:12.263 --> 27:14.965
       - Hey, stay safe.

27:20.939 --> 27:23.040
     - Hey, what happened?

27:23.042 --> 27:26.176
       With you and hank
   and jimmy shi over there?

27:26.178 --> 27:29.246
          - Ask hank.
  - I did, and he clammed up.

27:29.248 --> 27:31.115
      - Well, sounds like
   you got your answer, then.

27:31.117 --> 27:32.282
            - Al...

27:32.284 --> 27:34.652
        Who's browning?
           - [sighs]

27:37.122 --> 27:38.689
     - Jimmy mentioned him,
   and then the three of you

27:38.691 --> 27:40.257
     Started trading looks.

27:40.259 --> 27:42.226
  - You know something, erin?

27:42.228 --> 27:45.262
  You ever hear the expression
    "let sleeping dogs lie"?

       - I'm a detective.
        I poke the dogs.

34:15.219 --> 34:17.286
           - See you.

34:31.536 --> 34:34.204
           - I'm not
       the bad guy here.

34:34.206 --> 34:35.705
         - That's cool.

34:35.706 --> 34:37.174
       Not my department.

34:37.176 --> 34:38.675
       - I'm good police.
             - Wow.

34:38.677 --> 34:41.078
        I so don't care.

34:41.080 --> 34:42.779
          - Hey, jin.

34:42.781 --> 34:45.449
            - Okay.
       Well, good night.

34:45.451 --> 34:46.850
     See you guys tomorrow.

34:46.851 --> 34:48.552
          - Oh, well,
    you might want to check

34:48.554 --> 34:49.686
      With sergeant voight
          about that.

34:49.688 --> 34:52.789
      - Yeah, don't think
         I'll need to.

34:56.694 --> 35:00.230
     - Thanks for tracking
    the rodiger credit card.

35:00.232 --> 35:03.800
- You know, you better be right
about this, or it's my ass too.

35:13.177 --> 35:15.745
       - Good day today.
            - Yeah.

35:15.747 --> 35:19.583
 - What are your plans tonight?
     - Uh, I'm babysitting.

35:19.585 --> 35:21.551
             - Ooh.
       - What about you?

35:21.553 --> 35:23.487
           - Molly's.
            See you.

35:23.489 --> 35:25.856
        - Hey, antonio?

35:27.625 --> 35:29.793
            [sighs]

35:29.795 --> 35:33.130
       You know anything
   about the name "browning"?

35:34.632 --> 35:37.467
      Come on, man, voight
  won't give me anything here.

35:41.772 --> 35:44.307
           - [sighs]
        - I got to know.

35:49.847 --> 35:52.549
           - Well...

35:52.551 --> 35:54.551
       There's rumors...

35:54.553 --> 35:57.220
       There's stories...

35:57.222 --> 36:00.690
          And there's
     what's in the record.

36:00.692 --> 36:03.393
  All I can tell you is this--

36:03.395 --> 36:07.230
   A cop named eddie penland
     was killed on the job.

36:07.232 --> 36:09.566
   He was olinsky's partner.

36:10.701 --> 36:15.372
A lot of people thought a heavy
named browning was the shooter.

36:15.374 --> 36:19.509
  He heard the heat was on him
     and turned himself in.

36:19.511 --> 36:22.746
Last they were seen was getting
 into jimmy and voight's squad.

36:22.748 --> 36:26.316
     Olinsky was with them.

36:28.553 --> 36:31.288
     Browning never made it
          to the jail.

36:35.726 --> 36:37.327
       That's all I know.

36:42.266 --> 36:44.334
     Have fun babysitting.

36:44.336 --> 36:46.636
        - Yeah, thanks.

36:52.877 --> 36:54.711
             Nadia!

37:01.252 --> 37:04.487
             Nadia.

37:06.891 --> 37:08.825
              Hey.

37:11.229 --> 37:13.730
            Damn it.

37:17.702 --> 37:20.570
         Where are you?

37:20.572 --> 37:21.938
         - I couldn't.

37:21.940 --> 37:23.540
         - No, no, no.

37:23.542 --> 37:25.308
            Come on.
        Come on, nadia.

37:25.310 --> 37:28.712
     Tomorrow you and me--
   we walk in there together.

37:28.714 --> 37:31.014
           - I can't.
        - Yes, you can.

37:31.016 --> 37:33.283
        You are strong.
I know you don't think you are.

37:33.285 --> 37:34.684
     But I'm telling you--
         - I gotta go.

37:34.686 --> 37:36.286
            - Hello?

37:36.288 --> 37:38.355
             Nadia?

37:49.500 --> 37:51.801
         - [chuckling]

37:51.803 --> 37:55.872
 - The magnificent mile detail
   is looking for patrolmen,

37:55.874 --> 38:00.410
    So I recommended you to
 sergeant castellaw over there.

38:00.412 --> 38:03.647
          - All right,
whatever you think is best, man.

38:06.450 --> 38:08.685
       - I'm just messing
         with you, man.

38:08.687 --> 38:10.453
           You know?
         - This guy...

38:10.455 --> 38:11.855
         - And I heard
      you did good today.

38:11.857 --> 38:13.690
      - You did, did you?

38:13.692 --> 38:16.559
    - So, what'd you learn?

38:16.561 --> 38:17.961
          - I learned
    that things can jump off

38:17.963 --> 38:20.597
 No matter what you're wearing.
            - Yeah.

38:20.599 --> 38:22.766
     All right, so you come
    ready to work tomorrow.

38:22.768 --> 38:24.067
         But next time
   I hear you big-dogging it

38:24.069 --> 38:26.036
 To any of your academy mates,

38:26.038 --> 38:27.871
      You're not gonna get
        a third chance.

38:27.873 --> 38:29.439
      - Never again, boss.
          - All right?

38:29.441 --> 38:30.840
         - Never again.

38:30.842 --> 38:32.709
             - Hey.
        Everything okay?

38:32.711 --> 38:35.312
         - Ask me that
    after I've had a drink.

38:39.550 --> 38:43.586
  - First rule of a gunfight--
          bring a gun.

38:43.588 --> 38:46.790
         Second rule--
    bring friends with guns.

38:46.792 --> 38:48.692
    Here's to having friends
          in chicago.

38:48.694 --> 38:50.660
           - [laughs]
          I like that.

38:50.662 --> 38:52.896
           - [laughs]

38:52.898 --> 38:55.432
             - Mm.

38:55.434 --> 38:58.068
       I learned it from
an old sergeant back in patrol.

38:58.070 --> 38:59.803
    - We want another round?
         I need a beer.

38:59.805 --> 39:02.072
     - Well, you're buying.
            - Pfft.

39:02.074 --> 39:03.606
             - Hey.
           [whistles]

39:03.608 --> 39:05.575
     We need another round
          and a beer.

39:05.577 --> 39:08.778
        [low murmuring]

39:12.717 --> 39:14.484
             - Hey.
             - Hey.

39:19.590 --> 39:22.759
           - Kevin...

39:22.761 --> 39:24.728
        Dinner's ready.

39:24.730 --> 39:26.996
     - What are we having?
          - Swanson's.

39:26.998 --> 39:29.833
          - Bump that.
  We going to bijan's tonight.

39:32.069 --> 39:34.404
     Go tell your brothers.

39:54.158 --> 39:56.426
          - You alone?

39:59.897 --> 40:02.632
    This better be important
    to drag my ass out here.

40:02.634 --> 40:03.800
            - It is.

40:03.802 --> 40:05.602
      I need you to buy me
       a little clearance

40:05.604 --> 40:09.072
          While I have
     a new load brought in.

40:09.074 --> 40:11.975
            - Fine.

40:14.745 --> 40:17.781
           - I swear,
  you are gonna bleed me dry.

40:17.783 --> 40:19.916
         - Green blood
    don't ever run dry, bro.

40:19.918 --> 40:21.951
       [sirens whooping]

40:23.921 --> 40:25.755
    - What the hell is this?

40:25.757 --> 40:27.791
      - Don't say a word.

40:38.636 --> 40:40.203
          - Let's go.

40:42.606 --> 40:45.008
         - Hook him up.

40:46.911 --> 40:49.779
      [handcuffs clicking]

40:49.781 --> 40:54.117
        Sergeant voight,
     you are under arrest.

40:55.786 --> 40:58.621
     - What are you doing?

40:58.623 --> 41:01.558
       - You're finished.
