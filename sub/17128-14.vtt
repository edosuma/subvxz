12:01.121 --> 12:04.294
HEY, GEORGE,
MAX´S SCHOOL´S ON THE PHONE.

12:04.294 --> 12:06.156
THEY WANT TO KNOW
IF HE´S HOME SICK.

12:06.156 --> 12:08.728
HE´S NOT SICK.
I SAW HIM LEAVE THIS MORNING.

12:08.728 --> 12:10.000
WELL, HE NEVER SHOWED UP.

12:10.000 --> 12:12.903
RICKY.
I KNEW IT.

12:15.966 --> 12:17.267
WHAT HAPPENED?

12:17.267 --> 12:19.439
YOU SEE, I WAS REFFING
A SOCCER GAME --

12:19.439 --> 12:21.041
STOP.

12:21.041 --> 12:24.244
ALREADY BORING.

12:28.478 --> 12:30.480
MAX!

12:30.480 --> 12:32.853
MAX!!

12:32.853 --> 12:34.324
Ricky: COME ON!
TRY IT AGAIN!

12:34.324 --> 12:36.126
Max: IT WON´T MOVE!
IT´S STUCK!

12:43.964 --> 12:46.296
GET --
GET OUT OF THE CAR!

12:46.296 --> 12:47.898
NO, SAVE YOURSELF!

12:47.898 --> 12:50.540
STAY IN THE CAR,
LOCK THE DOOR!
ERNIE!

12:50.540 --> 12:52.803
OPEN THE BACK FOR ME!
HURRY!

12:52.803 --> 12:54.945
HE´S COMING!
HURRY!

12:59.349 --> 13:01.781
HOW THE HELL
DID THAT HAPPEN?

13:01.781 --> 13:05.785
WELL, WE WERE TRYING TO
SURPRISE YOU AND WASH YOUR CAR,

13:05.785 --> 13:08.158
BUT...
THE HOSE WAS TOO SHORT.

13:09.820 --> 13:12.863
I LOVE YOU, DAD.

13:12.863 --> 13:14.064
LOOK, I WANT THE TRUTH.

13:14.064 --> 13:15.996
OKAY, HERE´S WHAT HAPPENED.

13:15.996 --> 13:17.928
WE DITCHED SCHOOL,
BUT IT WAS LUCKY

13:17.928 --> 13:20.971
BECAUSE TWO GANGBANGERS
WERE STEALING YOUR CAR.

13:20.971 --> 13:22.833
WE SCARED THEM AWAY.

13:22.833 --> 13:25.876
BUT WHEN WE WERE TRYING TO PUT
THE CAR BACK IN THE DRIVEWAY,

13:25.876 --> 13:27.077
WE CRASHED, SO...

13:27.077 --> 13:29.209
I GUESS YOU´RE WELCOME,
MR. LOPEZ!

13:32.012 --> 13:33.383
YOU, YOU´RE GOING BACK
TO SCHOOL.

13:33.383 --> 13:35.185
WE´LL DEAL WITH THIS
TONIGHT.

13:35.185 --> 13:36.816
AND YOU --
YOU´RE OUT OF HERE, MAN!

13:36.816 --> 13:38.018
I´M TAKING YOU BACK
TO YOUR MOTHER.

13:38.018 --> 13:39.489
AND SAY GOODBYE TO MAX.

13:39.489 --> 13:42.122
BECAUSE THAT´S THE LAST TIME
YOU´RE GONNA SEE HIM.

13:42.122 --> 13:44.254
DO YOU KNOW YOU COULD
HAVE KILLED SOMEONE?!

13:44.254 --> 13:46.326
WELL, HEY,
YOUR MOM SITS OUT HERE.

13:46.326 --> 13:48.398
WHAT IF SHE WAS
IN THAT CHAIR?

13:48.398 --> 13:50.830
DON´T TRY TO CHEER ME UP!
COME ON.

13:56.967 --> 14:00.911
YOU TWO WAIT HERE.
I´LL TALK TO HIS MOM ALONE.

14:00.911 --> 14:02.042
ALL RIGHT.

14:06.046 --> 14:08.848
YOU KNOW, THAT WAS A PRETTY
STUPID STUNT YOU TWO PULLED.

14:08.848 --> 14:11.421
I KNOW.

14:11.421 --> 14:14.354
DO YOU THINK HE´LL EVER
LET ME SEE MAX AGAIN?

14:14.354 --> 14:16.987
HE´S PRETTY MAD, RICKY.

14:16.987 --> 14:19.329
MAX IS MY BEST FRIEND.

14:22.362 --> 14:24.094
YOU KNOW WHAT?

14:24.094 --> 14:27.367
ONCE GEORGE COOLS DOWN, I´LL TRY
AND TALK TO HIM, ALL RIGHT?

14:27.367 --> 14:32.442
THANKS, ERNIE.

14:32.442 --> 14:36.406
[ Chuckling ]
ACTUALLY, YEAH.

14:36.406 --> 14:38.248
ONE TIME, GEORGE AND I
BROKE INTO SCHOOL

14:38.248 --> 14:41.081
WITH A WHOLE BUNCH OF
SPRAY PAINT, AND WE, UH--

14:42.512 --> 14:46.516
MADE A BANNER THAT SAID,
"LEARNING IS COOL."

14:46.516 --> 14:49.619
WHOO!
THOSE WERE THE DAYS, MAN!

15:02.572 --> 15:07.137
[ Slurred ] YOU´RE NOT
THE USUAL DELIVERY GUY.

15:07.137 --> 15:08.538
WHERE´S MY ORDER?

15:08.538 --> 15:13.013
NO, I´M GEORGE LOPEZ.
I BROUGHT RICKY WITH ME.

15:13.013 --> 15:14.344
[ LAUGHS ]

15:14.344 --> 15:19.019
WHAT WAS RICKY DOING
AT THE LIQUOR STORE?

15:19.019 --> 15:23.093
HEY, NO, I´M MAX´S DAD.
RICKY WAS STAYING WITH US.

15:23.093 --> 15:26.596
OHH, YOU´LL HAVE TO EXCUSE ME.
I JUST WOKE UP.

15:26.596 --> 15:28.198
WHY DON´T YOU COME IN?

15:28.198 --> 15:31.561
I´M WAITING FOR SOME WINE
TO BE DELIVERED.

15:31.561 --> 15:35.035
YOU KNOW, IT´S 10:30
IN THE MORNING.

15:35.035 --> 15:36.506
IT´S A WHITE WINE.

15:38.408 --> 15:42.142
LISTEN, I GOT TO TALK
TO YOU ABOUT RICKY.

15:42.142 --> 15:44.044
OH, NO, HE´S NOT HERE.

15:44.044 --> 15:47.077
I LEFT HIM WITH
THE NICEST PEOPLE.

15:47.077 --> 15:50.720
YOU LEFT HIM WITH ME.

15:50.720 --> 15:53.253
[ Laughing ]
OHH, I´M SORRY!

15:53.253 --> 15:56.086
I JUST CAN´T
THINK STRAIGHT.

15:56.086 --> 15:59.059
I JUST BROKE UP
WITH MY BOYFRIEND

15:59.059 --> 16:02.332
AND I´M TRYING TO
GET MY LIFE TOGETHER.

16:02.332 --> 16:04.394
[ SIGHS ]

16:04.394 --> 16:08.468
MAYBE I SHOULD CALL HIS DAD.
CAN I GET HIS NUMBER?

16:08.468 --> 16:10.100
YEAH. NOT FROM ME.

16:10.100 --> 16:12.242
I HAVE NO IDEA
WHERE HE IS.

16:12.242 --> 16:14.744
BUT IF YOU FIND HIM,
YOU TELL THAT LOSER

16:14.744 --> 16:18.508
THAT HE OWES ME 10 YEARS´ WORTH
OF CHILD SUPPORT.

16:18.508 --> 16:20.610
RIGHT.

16:22.712 --> 16:25.485
OKAY, LOOK, MAYBE I SHOULD JUST
TAKE RICKY BACK TO SCHOOL.

16:28.318 --> 16:29.359
YEAH.

16:31.261 --> 16:33.563
[ Chuckling ] NOW´S NOT
A VERY GOOD TIME FOR ME.

16:36.666 --> 16:38.168
IF YOU WANT...

16:38.168 --> 16:42.132
HE COULD STAY WITH US
FOR A COUPLE MORE DAYS.

16:42.132 --> 16:48.007
OH, THANK YOU!

16:50.640 --> 16:54.244
YOU´RE AN ANGEL.

16:54.244 --> 16:58.188
[ Off-key]
♫ ANGEL ♫

16:58.188 --> 17:02.252
♫ YOU´RE MY ANGEL ♫

17:02.252 --> 17:06.596

17:06.596 --> 17:11.030

17:11.030 --> 17:16.366

17:19.169 --> 17:25.345
[ Off-key ] ♫ THE ANGEL
IS SHUTTING THE DOOR ♫

17:33.453 --> 17:36.086
HERE, RICKY.
PUT YOUR STUFF IN MAX´S ROOM.

17:36.086 --> 17:37.257
I´LL GIVE YOU A HAND.

17:41.831 --> 17:44.294
YOU WERE RIGHT.
RICKY IS A BAD SEED.

17:44.294 --> 17:46.836
I NEVER WANT TO SEE
THAT LITTLE PUNK AGAIN.

17:46.836 --> 17:49.099
I BROUGHT HIM BACK.

17:49.099 --> 17:51.101
HE´S IN THE HOUSE.

17:51.101 --> 17:53.343
OH, HE WOULDN´T TELL YOU
WHERE HE LIVES, HUH?

17:53.343 --> 17:54.674
OKAY,
I´LL GET IT OUT OF HIM.

17:54.674 --> 17:57.147
YOU JUST TURN UP THE STEREO
REAL LOUD

17:57.147 --> 17:59.109
SO THE NEIGHBORS
DON´T HEAR ANYTHING.

17:59.109 --> 18:00.650
ANGIE...

18:00.650 --> 18:02.152
I WENT TO HIS APARTMENT.

18:02.152 --> 18:04.654
HIS MOM WAS DRUNK
AT 10:30 IN THE MORNING.

18:04.654 --> 18:05.855
OH, MAN.

18:05.855 --> 18:09.459
NO WONDER
HE´S SO SCREWED UP.

18:09.459 --> 18:11.421
I COULDN´T LEAVE HIM THERE.

18:11.421 --> 18:14.494
I WANT HIM
TO STAY WITH US FOR A WHILE.

18:14.494 --> 18:15.725
ARE YOU CRAZY?

18:15.725 --> 18:18.568
FIRST THE GARAGE,
THEN THE FENCE.

18:18.568 --> 18:22.472
HE´S GETTING CLOSER
TO WHERE WE SLEEP, GEORGE.

18:22.472 --> 18:26.176
ANGIE, HIS DAD WALKED OUT
ON HIM, TOO.

18:26.176 --> 18:29.209
HONEY...
THIS ISN´T YOUR LIFE.

18:29.209 --> 18:30.640
NO, IT MIGHT BE WORSE.

18:30.640 --> 18:33.783
MY MOM WAS ROUGH, BUT AT LEAST
SHE WASN´T A DRUNK.

18:33.783 --> 18:37.217
LISTEN, YOU KNOW I´M ALWAYS
THE FIRST TO HELP OUT.

18:37.217 --> 18:39.749
I SPENT THE ENTIRE MORNING
GIVING MAKEOVERS

18:39.749 --> 18:42.452
TO 45 HOMELESS WOMEN,
AND IT WASN´T EASY.

18:42.452 --> 18:45.455
YOU TRY CONVINCING A LADY
WITH LEAVES IN HER HAIR

18:45.455 --> 18:47.126
THAT SHE IS NOT AN AUTUMN.

18:47.126 --> 18:49.259
SO WHY CAN´T WE
HELP RICKY?

18:49.259 --> 18:52.232
BECAUSE...WE HAVE TO
THINK ABOUT MAX FIRST.

18:52.232 --> 18:54.634
HE´S ABOUT TO FAIL
THE FIFTH GRADE,

18:54.634 --> 18:57.267
AND RICKY IS A BAD INFLUENCE
ON HIM.

18:57.267 --> 18:58.808
YOU SAID SO YOURSELF.

18:58.808 --> 19:00.770
I DON´T WANT HIM
IN OUR HOUSE.

19:00.770 --> 19:03.913
WELL, IF HE CAN´T GO HOME
AND HE CAN´T STAY HERE,

19:03.913 --> 19:05.815
WHAT´S HE SUPPOSED TO DO?

19:05.815 --> 19:07.277
WHAT IF HE STAYS WITH ME?

19:07.277 --> 19:08.578
COME ON, ERNIE.

19:08.578 --> 19:11.150
NO, HE CAN STAY WITH ME
AND MY FOLKS.

19:11.150 --> 19:12.652
YOU SERIOUS?

19:12.652 --> 19:13.853
YEAH, YOU REMEMBER.

19:13.853 --> 19:15.785
MY MOM AND DAD
USED TO BE FOSTER PARENTS.

19:15.785 --> 19:18.388
I COULD GET CERTIFIED WHILE
RICKY´S STAYING WITH US.

19:18.388 --> 19:20.159
BUT, DUDE, COME ON.

19:20.159 --> 19:23.162
TAKING ON A KID, ISN´T THAT
GONNA CUT INTO YOUR SOCIAL --

19:26.266 --> 19:28.298
WHAT ABOUT CLIMBING UP
THE CORPORATE --

19:31.201 --> 19:33.172
WHAT IF YOU
MEET A GIRL WHO --

19:34.744 --> 19:38.378
YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU CAN TAKE MY KIDS, TOO.

19:38.378 --> 19:40.810
THIS IS GONNA WORK,
GEORGE.

19:40.810 --> 19:44.854
I CAN ACTUALLY MAKE
A DIFFERENCE IN SOMEONE´S LIFE.

19:44.854 --> 19:47.357
ERNIE´S PARENTS DO HAVE
PLENTY OF ROOM.

19:47.357 --> 19:49.789
THEY EVEN HAVE THAT PANELED
BASEMENT DOWNSTAIRS

19:49.789 --> 19:52.692
WHERE ERNIE TRIED TO DO HIS OWN
CABLE-ACCESS SHOW,

19:52.692 --> 19:54.424
"IT´S ME, ERNIE."

19:55.965 --> 19:57.697
I´M GONNA GO TALK TO RICKY.

19:57.697 --> 20:00.770
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO IF HE
DRIVES A CAR THROUGH YOUR FENCE?

20:00.770 --> 20:05.575
GEORGE, MY DAD´S 75.
HE DOES THAT ONCE A WEEK.

20:09.979 --> 20:13.543
HEY, I CAN´T FIND DAD ANYWHERE.

20:13.543 --> 20:17.487
COME ON MOM. WE´RE GOING TO BE
LATE FOR MY POETRY READING.

20:34.804 --> 20:36.466
GEORGE

20:36.466 --> 20:39.839
I KNOW YOU´RE IN THERE.

20:41.711 --> 20:45.415
YOU´RE GOING TO MISS YOUR OWN
DAUGHTER´S POETRY READING.

20:46.416 --> 20:48.548
I CAN´T HEAR YOU. I´M TRASH.
