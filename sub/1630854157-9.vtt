Ah, boy, do I love
the Fall Festival.

00:40.449 --> 00:42.041
Especially how
everywhere you turn

00:42.268 --> 00:43.876
is the smell of pumpkin spice.

00:44.027 --> 00:45.435
Pumpkin spice.

00:45.529 --> 00:48.772
Sounds like a reject
from a female British pop band.

00:49.775 --> 00:51.775
Quit tossing your scarf
over your shoulder

00:51.794 --> 00:52.867
to punctuate your jokes.

00:53.036 --> 00:53.944
You know what, Peter?

00:54.113 --> 00:55.128
I like me.

00:55.281 --> 00:56.630
Look, "Guess Your Weight."

00:56.724 --> 01:01.310
With a line that long, I'll
guess my own wait: 30 minutes.

01:02.212 --> 01:04.045
Oop, see you in a few.

01:04.065 --> 01:06.065
Got scarfed up.

01:11.480 --> 01:12.813
(laughing)

01:12.965 --> 01:14.131
No. No, no, no.

01:14.224 --> 01:15.966
I don't-- I don't
throw in public.

01:15.968 --> 01:17.651
Ugh, and I only fetch.

01:17.745 --> 01:19.653
All right, I'll see
if I can get my money back.

01:19.747 --> 01:20.746
Excuse me?

01:29.906 --> 01:32.257
Oh, cool. I like your tattoo.

01:32.409 --> 01:35.243
Oh, that? Yeah, that's the
Hormone Monstress.

01:35.262 --> 01:37.154
She likes sex
and I like sex, so I figured

01:37.172 --> 01:39.914
I'd permanently disfigure
myself with something

01:39.934 --> 01:42.159
I'd seen on Netflix three times.

01:42.177 --> 01:43.677
You like sex, huh?

01:43.829 --> 01:46.555
You, uh, wouldn't maybe want
to grab dinner sometime?

01:46.665 --> 01:49.257
Nah, but I'll bang you
in the porta-potty

01:49.276 --> 01:51.593
back by the
very loud generators.

01:51.612 --> 01:54.004
The one that smells like all
different pees mixed together?

01:54.022 --> 01:55.447
Um, hell yes.

01:55.674 --> 01:56.673
See ya, Stewie.

01:56.766 --> 01:57.674
Wait, you're just going to

01:57.767 --> 01:58.784
leave me here by myself?

01:58.894 --> 02:00.435
Look at all these
ne'er-do-wells.

02:00.454 --> 02:03.497
When's that guy
gonna do well? Ne'er.

02:07.128 --> 02:10.370
Hello, carnival-goers, and
welcome to "Generation Gap,"

02:10.522 --> 02:12.689
where we learn which of these
parents and kids

02:12.708 --> 02:13.799
know each other best.

02:14.026 --> 02:16.135
How'd you get Dad to agree
to be in this?

02:16.362 --> 02:18.804
I rescued him from
the corn maze, so he owes me.

02:18.955 --> 02:19.880
Oh.

02:20.032 --> 02:21.456
Yeah, he was crying.

02:21.550 --> 02:22.808
Okay, first question:

02:22.959 --> 02:25.385
Parents, what does your child
want to be

02:25.537 --> 02:27.220
when they grow up?

02:27.314 --> 02:29.815
How did you answer,
Team Number One?

02:29.966 --> 02:31.483
Lady NASA scientist.

02:31.635 --> 02:34.135
Okay, weird, and what did
you say, Dad?

02:34.229 --> 02:35.896
<i> Hidden Figures</i> gal?

02:36.048 --> 02:36.880
Judges?

02:36.899 --> 02:37.972
-(bell dings)
-A match.

02:37.992 --> 02:38.973
(crowd applauding)

02:39.067 --> 02:40.400
Team Number Two?

02:40.552 --> 02:42.068
You both said, "Retire after

02:42.163 --> 02:44.312
large personal
injury settlement."

02:44.331 --> 02:45.313
-Bravo.
-(bell dings)

02:45.332 --> 02:47.148
-(crowd applauding)
-Team Three?

02:47.168 --> 02:50.560
Guy who holds the "Slow" sign
during road construction.

02:50.579 --> 02:52.229
And, Dad, you said...?

02:52.247 --> 02:53.672
-Leprechaun.
-(buzzer buzzing)

02:53.899 --> 02:55.674
(laughter)

02:55.901 --> 02:57.734
Ooh, our first wrong answer.

02:57.827 --> 02:58.902
Fat Leprechaun?

02:58.921 --> 02:59.845
Also incorrect.

03:00.072 --> 03:01.071
You may not understand the game.

03:01.164 --> 03:02.347
Next question:

03:02.499 --> 03:06.518
Kids, what would your parent
say is their hobby?

03:06.745 --> 03:07.744
Team Number One?

03:07.763 --> 03:09.079
Refurbishing people's

03:09.081 --> 03:10.096
garage door openers.

03:10.249 --> 03:11.339
That's a match.

03:11.433 --> 03:12.933
-(bell ringing)
-It's one button.

03:13.085 --> 03:15.068
You just got to fix one button.

03:19.608 --> 03:21.700
Okay, final question.

03:21.851 --> 03:25.429
Team Three, who is your child's
favorite singer?

03:25.447 --> 03:27.113
<i> The Price is Right</i> yodeler.

03:27.266 --> 03:29.524
What? No. I said Adele.

03:29.618 --> 03:30.525
Judges?

03:30.544 --> 03:31.768
(buzzer buzzing)

03:31.861 --> 03:33.770
(laughter)

03:33.863 --> 03:35.622
Ugh, this is more humiliating

03:35.716 --> 03:38.700
than my first day working at
that rice pilaf company.

03:38.794 --> 03:42.446
You know, I think we can start
putting pilaf in other things.

03:42.464 --> 03:45.115
Lois, can I see you
in my office for a second?

03:45.133 --> 03:46.541
(Lois sobbing)

03:46.635 --> 03:49.728
I told you not to rock
the boat over there.

03:53.234 --> 03:55.234
Oh, there you are, little dude.

03:55.461 --> 03:57.827
Ah, finally back from
the carnival, I see.

03:57.829 --> 03:59.238
Ah, it was amazing.

03:59.465 --> 04:01.889
I got to tell you
all about Amber, amigo.

04:01.909 --> 04:03.984
"Little dude"? "Amigo"?

04:04.152 --> 04:06.820
Brian, have you...
have you forgotten my name?

04:06.972 --> 04:08.730
I don't know, I-I spent
the whole afternoon

04:08.749 --> 04:10.249
drinking ethanol out of a ladle.

04:10.400 --> 04:11.308
It's "Stewie."

04:11.326 --> 04:12.567
Stewie, right.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

04:12.586 --> 04:16.146
Anyway, Amber is, like,
the perfect girl for me.

04:16.164 --> 04:17.497
How old is she, even?

04:17.649 --> 04:18.982
Well, she's so weathered

04:19.001 --> 04:20.667
that that's a hard number
to peg.

04:20.819 --> 04:23.153
Either 27 or 61.

04:23.246 --> 04:25.505
But the thing is, Stewie,
she's leaving town

04:25.657 --> 04:27.507
with the carnival
in three days, Stewie,

04:27.659 --> 04:31.937
so it's sex-sex-sex and
then "adios," Stewie.

04:32.164 --> 04:34.756
By the way, and, like,
relax about this,

04:34.833 --> 04:38.026
but is abortion
still legal in Rhode Island?

04:41.282 --> 04:44.174
Peter, it was humiliating
having the whole town witness

04:44.192 --> 04:46.860
you and Chris not knowing the
first thing about each other.

04:47.012 --> 04:48.512
I know the first
thing about him.

04:48.514 --> 04:51.681
It was his goopy head squishing
out of you like toothpaste.

04:51.700 --> 04:54.351
Peter, it's important
a boy knows his father.

04:54.369 --> 04:56.703
Now go up to Chris' room
and talk to him.

04:56.855 --> 04:58.380
(sighs)

05:01.209 --> 05:02.968
Hey, Chris, can I talk
to you for a second?

05:03.119 --> 05:04.361
Next door over, Chief.

05:04.379 --> 05:05.545
Roger that.

05:06.715 --> 05:08.289
-(Peter knocking)
-STEWIE: Yeah, Pop? What's up?

05:08.383 --> 05:09.558
PETER:
Oh, I'm so sorry.

05:10.536 --> 05:12.218
-Chris?
-Yes?

05:12.371 --> 05:13.270
Phew.

05:24.474 --> 05:26.307
(sighs) Is there something
you want, Dad?

05:26.401 --> 05:28.718
I don't know.
Your mom sent me up here.

05:28.737 --> 05:30.904
We-we embarrassed her in front
of the town or something.

05:30.998 --> 05:33.314
Ugh, that is so Mom,

05:33.392 --> 05:35.817
always getting mad about
stuff that doesn't even matter.

05:36.027 --> 05:37.485
Oh, my God, tell me about it.

05:37.504 --> 05:39.338
I can't tell you how tired
I am of hearing,

05:39.565 --> 05:42.732
"Peter, don't use my hair dryer
to dry your anus."

05:42.901 --> 05:44.734
(laughs) Yeah, or

05:44.753 --> 05:47.904
"Chris, stop freezing
bees until they fall asleep

05:47.997 --> 05:49.997
and gluing little leashes
on them."

05:50.092 --> 05:51.741
(laughs) Totally.

05:51.760 --> 05:53.685
God, I can't believe
you notice this stuff, too.

05:53.837 --> 05:57.247
Oh, you mean like how if a pair
of her underpants goes missing

05:57.416 --> 05:59.524
she can't just let it go
and move on?

05:59.676 --> 06:00.842
Exactly.

06:00.861 --> 06:02.936
(laughter)

06:03.088 --> 06:06.198
Well, sounds like bonding to me.

06:06.349 --> 06:09.534
Looks like somebody worked some
pretty good mom magic.

06:10.537 --> 06:12.412
Huh? Where the hell
are all my underpants?

06:19.028 --> 06:20.695
Okay, place your bets.

06:20.864 --> 06:23.197
Stewie's shoe: burn or melt?

06:23.217 --> 06:25.275
I'm gonna say
a little bit of melt,

06:25.293 --> 06:27.677
and then a lot
of very quick burn.

06:32.041 --> 06:34.801
Wow, would not have expected
rainbow sparks.

06:34.953 --> 06:36.878
Lot of chemicals
near my baby's foot.

06:36.897 --> 06:39.472
Well, look at you two
getting along.

06:39.566 --> 06:40.974
Now I wonder who made
that happ--

06:41.068 --> 06:43.309
Oh, my God, are you
lighting fires in the house?

06:43.462 --> 06:45.478
Huh. Just what we
guessed you'd say.

06:45.631 --> 06:47.313
Yeah, it was either
gonna be that or,

06:47.466 --> 06:50.075
"I'm Lois. When I don't
hit my step goals,

06:50.226 --> 06:53.319
I spin my arm
around to trick my Fitbit."

06:53.414 --> 06:55.029
(laughter)

06:55.140 --> 06:56.915
Wh-What is that?
Is that supposed to be me?

06:57.066 --> 06:59.734
Oh, I don't know.
Maybe you'll recognize this one.

06:59.828 --> 07:02.996
"I'm Mom. I cry on the toilet

07:03.148 --> 07:06.407
as I circle things in catalogs
I'll never afford."

07:06.427 --> 07:07.667
(laughter)

07:07.761 --> 07:09.502
(smoke alarm beeping)

07:09.655 --> 07:12.097
Ah, damn it.
Look what you guys did.

07:13.008 --> 07:15.158
(toy siren wails)

07:15.251 --> 07:18.511
All right, men, looks like Mom's
got this one under control.

07:18.664 --> 07:22.274
Now back to the station for
spaghetti and a group shower.

07:31.618 --> 07:33.176
Oh, hey, Stewie, perfect timing.

07:33.269 --> 07:35.603
-Amber, come meet Stewie.
-Pass.

07:35.622 --> 07:38.181
Ooh, he's so cute.

07:38.200 --> 07:40.700
I just got to kidnap him,
don't I?

07:40.869 --> 07:41.793
Would you like that?

07:41.945 --> 07:43.186
I stuff you in a duffel bag,

07:43.279 --> 07:45.446
zip it up, we're in Indiana
before you know it?

07:45.540 --> 07:46.781
Charmed.

07:46.800 --> 07:47.874
Isn't she awesome?

07:48.026 --> 07:49.116
You want to come inside, babe?

07:49.285 --> 07:51.136
Nah, I'm just gonna park it here
for a few hours

07:51.287 --> 07:56.141
and watch<i> Fuller House</i>
on my stepson's cracked iPad.

07:56.368 --> 07:59.703
I'm telling you, Stewie, this
thing is all next-level sex.

07:59.796 --> 08:03.206
The rugs in her van are just
filled with crushed Froot Loops.

08:03.225 --> 08:05.967
So, while we're doing it, I can
lean over and lick the crumbs.

08:06.135 --> 08:07.877
I'm familiar with
the temptations

08:07.896 --> 08:09.362
of crushed Froot Loops,
thank you.

08:10.473 --> 08:12.716
Brian, you should know
the Nextdoor app

08:12.734 --> 08:14.141
is on fire right now.

08:14.161 --> 08:16.995
"Have you seen the van?"
"What's with the van?"

08:17.146 --> 08:18.738
"Here's a photo of the van."

08:18.890 --> 08:21.983
"I checked with the police
and we can't get rid of the van

08:22.002 --> 08:23.818
unless we witness
criminal activity."

08:23.837 --> 08:25.562
And then just some
nervous comments

08:25.655 --> 08:28.340
about the Black Amazon driver,
but you get the gist.

08:32.012 --> 08:34.904
Hurry up, gang,
the movie starts soon.

08:34.998 --> 08:36.163
What are we seeing, Mom?

08:36.258 --> 08:38.591
Oh, something I've been
waiting forever for:

08:38.744 --> 08:41.427
<i> Penelope's Struggle</i>
starring Renée Zellweger.

08:41.522 --> 08:43.004
The dramatic, true story

08:43.098 --> 08:45.765
of the first female
carriage driver for the Queen.

08:45.859 --> 08:47.417
That movie sounds terrible.

08:47.435 --> 08:49.602
And, besides, Chris and I had
our hearts set on seeing

08:49.696 --> 08:52.422
the re-release of
<i> You Don't Mess with the Zohan,</i>

08:52.515 --> 08:54.866
now remastered
to be 40% louder.

08:55.093 --> 08:58.611
Oh, but, Peter,
you know I always choose

08:58.764 --> 09:00.764
the movie for
family movie night.

09:00.932 --> 09:02.615
It's tradition.

09:02.709 --> 09:07.771
Yeah, but just now I'm realizing
Chris and me are two guys.

09:07.864 --> 09:09.363
And you're only one guy.

09:09.532 --> 09:11.049
So, technically,
we can outvote you.

09:11.276 --> 09:13.276
I'm sorry. Out-outvote me?

09:13.369 --> 09:15.111
But-- but what about Meg?

09:15.130 --> 09:16.203
I-I mean, she obviously
gets a vo--

09:16.223 --> 09:18.298
All in on<i> Zohan,</i> bro.

09:18.392 --> 09:20.541
<i> ZOHAN:</i>
<i> My armpit is smelly</i>

09:20.561 --> 09:23.728
<i> and now you smell like</i>
<i> my smelly armpit.</i>

09:23.880 --> 09:25.880
(laughs) The whispers
in this movie

09:25.899 --> 09:28.358
would be yells in other movies.

09:32.147 --> 09:33.572
(Fitbit beeping)

09:33.799 --> 09:35.815
Ugh, these are basically steps,

09:35.984 --> 09:37.725
it's the same thing as steps.

09:37.744 --> 09:39.819
You can put all that away, Lois.

09:39.971 --> 09:41.988
Me and Chris just bought
dinner at the grocery store.

09:42.140 --> 09:44.974
The-the grocery store?
W-Without me?

09:45.026 --> 09:47.310
Okay, so everybody gets
four puddings

09:47.329 --> 09:48.995
and their own package
of bologna.

09:49.089 --> 09:51.481
But I spent all day
making lasagna.

09:51.499 --> 09:53.149
Yeah, no, our thing is more fun.

09:53.168 --> 09:54.150
Shall we take a vote?

09:54.243 --> 09:55.594
All in favor say "aye."

09:55.821 --> 09:56.820
-Aye.
-Aye.

09:56.838 --> 09:57.837
The "ayes" have it.

09:57.914 --> 09:59.246
Sorry, Lois, democracy.

09:59.308 --> 10:01.507
Oh, and we're dragging
the TV into the dining room.

10:01.584 --> 10:03.676
What? You know that's
not allowed.

10:03.829 --> 10:04.828
Vote? All in favor say "aye."

10:04.846 --> 10:05.770
-Aye.
-Aye.

10:05.997 --> 10:08.523
"Ayes" have it, sorry.
Kids, dinner.

10:11.612 --> 10:14.337
Dad, can we watch
<i> The White Lotus</i> ?

10:14.356 --> 10:15.096
Why not?

10:15.115 --> 10:16.430
I poop in a suitcase,

10:16.508 --> 10:17.949
I'm wrestled
to the ground at LaGuardia.

10:18.059 --> 10:20.243
That guy does it: gold statue.

10:22.623 --> 10:24.681
(phone chimes)

10:24.774 --> 10:25.682
Oh, boy.

10:25.775 --> 10:26.850
What? What is it?

10:26.868 --> 10:28.034
Text from Amber:

10:28.186 --> 10:30.019
"We should talk
about where this is going."

10:30.113 --> 10:32.188
Man, what if she wants
to get married?

10:32.207 --> 10:34.132
Ugh, looks like I have
to break things off with her.

10:34.283 --> 10:37.010
(tires screeching)

10:39.030 --> 10:41.714
Hey, Amber.
Listen, I got your text--

10:41.808 --> 10:43.867
Brian, this here
ain't working out.

10:43.960 --> 10:45.292
We need to break up.

10:45.312 --> 10:47.812
What?
You're breaking up with me?

10:48.039 --> 10:51.207
Whoa. Dumped by a carny. Brutal.

10:51.300 --> 10:53.467
Yeah, I've been thinking.

10:53.545 --> 10:55.211
We don't really
have much in common.

10:55.230 --> 10:57.822
I mean, you don't know
a single Kid Rock lyric

10:58.049 --> 11:00.383
or the names of
any monster trucks.

11:00.402 --> 11:03.644
Monst-- I--
Grave Maker, that's one.

11:03.664 --> 11:07.165
Ah! Grave Digger!
You're embarrassing yourself!

11:07.316 --> 11:09.559
Come on, what's this
really about?

11:09.652 --> 11:11.244
Is this because I couldn't
smash that Percocet

11:11.396 --> 11:12.671
into powder fast enough?

11:14.991 --> 11:18.551
Goodbye, Brian.

11:20.588 --> 11:23.848
Wow, buddy, I just want you
to know that I'm...

11:24.000 --> 11:25.091
She's stealing our mail.

11:25.243 --> 11:26.601
She's stealing our mail!

11:29.672 --> 11:31.431
Thanks for meeting me, guys.

11:31.583 --> 11:33.024
I should warn you:
this is gonna be

11:33.176 --> 11:36.102
a two-hands-on-the-coffee-cup
conversation.

11:36.196 --> 11:39.439
All right. Time to get
some work done.

11:39.533 --> 11:40.423
Don't mind me.

11:40.442 --> 11:42.425
This is screenwriting software.

11:42.518 --> 11:43.702
You've probably
never seen it before.

11:43.929 --> 11:45.428
You guys, I don't know
what to do.

11:45.597 --> 11:48.114
I-I told Peter to bond
with Chris, and he did,

11:48.266 --> 11:50.191
but now, well,
it's like they've stolen

11:50.285 --> 11:51.451
all the power in the family.

11:51.545 --> 11:52.711
Oh, no, no, no.

11:52.938 --> 11:55.271
For a mother to remain
in control of her family,

11:55.364 --> 11:57.716
she needs to make sure
there are no alliances

11:57.867 --> 11:58.883
she's not a part of.

11:59.035 --> 12:00.534
If a scene is in the sea,

12:00.554 --> 12:03.370
would you put
"interior" or "exterior"?

12:03.465 --> 12:04.464
Ah, never mind.

12:04.616 --> 12:05.782
No alliances, huh?

12:05.800 --> 12:07.283
What's a funny name for a boat?

12:07.376 --> 12:08.468
Well, then, that's it.

12:08.562 --> 12:11.062
I have to drive a wedge
between Peter and Chris.

12:11.214 --> 12:12.731
Push them back apart.

12:12.882 --> 12:16.960
Okay, now to loudly watch this
Aaron Sorkin MasterClass.

12:16.978 --> 12:20.146
<i> AARON SORKIN:</i>
<i> Hi, I'm Aaron Sorkin and</i>
<i> I've been paid a lot of money</i>

12:20.223 --> 12:22.966
<i> to give you false hope</i>
<i> about your ridiculous dream.</i>

12:23.059 --> 12:24.909
Oh, thanks, you guys.

12:25.061 --> 12:26.411
I got this.

12:26.562 --> 12:27.804
What the hell?

12:27.822 --> 12:29.247
My credit card is gone.

12:32.193 --> 12:33.643
"Dear Lois,

12:33.661 --> 12:36.980
Chris and I borrowed your credit
card to shop for fireworks

12:36.998 --> 12:39.740
you would normally
have to be a town to buy."

12:39.760 --> 12:42.594
(fireworks exploding)

12:42.821 --> 12:44.504
(Peter distantly laughing)

12:44.598 --> 12:46.656
PETER:
Ow! Ow! Ow!

12:46.658 --> 12:48.433
Gather all the fingers! Ow!

12:55.275 --> 13:00.003
All right, time to put an end
to this Peter-Chris alliance.

13:00.021 --> 13:03.189
Hey, FYI, I accidentally got
in the shower with my socks on.

13:03.341 --> 13:04.598
I wasn't sure what to do,

13:04.692 --> 13:07.010
so I just mashed them down
the drain with my elbow.

13:07.028 --> 13:08.861
Peter, we need to talk.

13:08.955 --> 13:11.531
I just found the oddest thing
in Chris' room.

13:11.683 --> 13:14.017
It's this essay he apparently
wrote for school

13:14.110 --> 13:16.702
about his hero: Joe Swanson.

13:16.797 --> 13:18.112
Joe Swanson?

13:18.131 --> 13:19.113
Let me see that.

13:20.116 --> 13:23.042
Okay, th-this is actually quite
long, can you just summarize it?

13:23.136 --> 13:25.545
Chris says,
"Mr. Swanson's skewed take

13:25.697 --> 13:29.198
"on contemporary politics
is painfully astute

13:29.292 --> 13:30.958
and refreshingly twisted."

13:31.052 --> 13:32.459
That son of a bitch.

13:32.479 --> 13:34.537
I've been like
a father to that kid.

13:34.539 --> 13:35.538
I know, right?

13:35.557 --> 13:38.191
I mean, who does Chris
think he is?

13:39.878 --> 13:41.319
The last three pages
is all about

13:41.470 --> 13:44.305
how you're aging as well
as Jennifer Lopez.

13:44.399 --> 13:45.156
(laughing)

13:45.308 --> 13:46.899
Well, that's our son.

13:46.993 --> 13:48.993
Oh, hey, Chris.

13:49.220 --> 13:50.736
You know, I just found
the oddest thing

13:50.831 --> 13:52.146
in your father's room:

13:52.240 --> 13:55.166
an essay he wrote for work
about his favorite son,

13:55.335 --> 13:57.743
Charles from<i> Charles in Charge.</i>

13:57.896 --> 14:00.730
What? But Charles wasn't
even one of the sons.

14:00.790 --> 14:02.582
He was their babysitter.

14:02.734 --> 14:04.250
I'm so sorry.

14:04.402 --> 14:06.419
I know it must be hard
to hear that your father

14:06.495 --> 14:08.421
would rather be a parent
to a fictional character

14:08.497 --> 14:11.407
who the writers, in five
seasons, never even bothered

14:11.500 --> 14:12.833
to give a last name--

14:12.927 --> 14:15.745
a totally weird but true fact,
feel free to Google that--

14:15.763 --> 14:16.929
than his own son.

14:17.082 --> 14:20.099
I hate him so much.

14:20.251 --> 14:24.028
Wait, Dad dots all his
I's with a smiley face?

14:24.105 --> 14:26.013
Yeah, that means he's got flair.

14:26.032 --> 14:27.681
Maybe those faces
brighten his otherwise

14:27.701 --> 14:29.942
bleak day just a tiny bit.

14:30.095 --> 14:31.185
Maybe he's known for them.

14:31.204 --> 14:34.038
I don't know,
it seems stupid and weird.

14:34.190 --> 14:35.522
You're stupid and weird!

14:35.542 --> 14:37.283
Now I see why
your father prefers

14:37.435 --> 14:39.627
Charles Last Name Unknown.

14:43.699 --> 14:46.626
Hello, uh, my name is Stewie,

14:46.778 --> 14:48.887
and I'm a milk-aholic.

14:49.114 --> 14:50.947
Okay, I figured out
what I got to do:

14:51.040 --> 14:52.873
I need to get back together
with Amber.

14:52.967 --> 14:55.393
What? But I thought you were
just about to break up with her.

14:55.544 --> 14:58.471
Brian, are you sure this isn't
just your wounded ego talking?

14:58.623 --> 14:59.546
Pfft, no. What?

14:59.566 --> 15:01.124
No, I-I can really
see us together.

15:01.217 --> 15:04.402
There's something romantic about
her style of life on the road.

15:04.629 --> 15:06.571
Oh, really?
What's the romantic part?

15:06.798 --> 15:08.965
Taking a whore bath
in a Taco Bell restroom

15:08.983 --> 15:12.135
or peeing in a Gatorade bottle
that you leave near a payphone?

15:12.153 --> 15:13.727
You don't know what
you're talking about.

15:13.747 --> 15:14.913
Don't I?

15:14.989 --> 15:17.064
Because I think that
you can't stand

15:17.083 --> 15:18.975
that you got dumped by a carny,

15:19.068 --> 15:20.919
someone you feel
is inferior to you.

15:21.070 --> 15:23.404
Fine, you're right, okay?
I'm pissed.

15:23.423 --> 15:26.482
That's why I'm off to win
Amber back so I can dump her.

15:26.501 --> 15:28.927
Look, man, I don't know if
Lois and the fat man told you,

15:29.095 --> 15:31.262
but they found a lump
on your neck.

15:31.414 --> 15:33.973
Is this really what you want
to spend your time on?

15:37.270 --> 15:38.828
What the hell?

15:38.846 --> 15:41.998
I thought you said we were both
gonna get Mark Davis haircuts.

15:42.016 --> 15:44.067
-Who's that?
-This maniac.

15:45.928 --> 15:48.171
I don't know what
you're talking about.

15:48.264 --> 15:49.839
I'm talking about
the voice mail you left me.

15:49.841 --> 15:52.933
Which now I see was all just
a trick to humiliate me.

15:52.953 --> 15:55.954
-I didn't leave you
a voice mail.
-Oh, no?

15:56.105 --> 15:57.789
<i> LOIS (imitating Chris):</i>
<i> Uh, hey, Dad.</i>

15:58.016 --> 15:59.791
<i> It's your son, Chris.</i>

15:59.942 --> 16:01.867
<i> Hot Pockets and</i> Fortnite.

16:01.962 --> 16:05.021
Son of a bitch,
I guess I did call you.

16:05.190 --> 16:07.448
<i> Hey, know what could be fun?</i>

16:07.467 --> 16:11.285
<i> If we both got bowl haircuts</i>
<i> like-- Oh, hang on.</i>

16:11.304 --> 16:12.862
<i> (normal voice):</i>
<i> Estrogen smoothie, please.</i>

16:12.880 --> 16:14.864
<i> Sorry, I'm busy</i>
<i> tricking my husband.</i>

16:14.957 --> 16:16.140
Wait a minute.

16:16.367 --> 16:18.643
I would never trick my husband.

16:18.794 --> 16:21.871
Dad, I think Mom
may have left that message.

16:21.889 --> 16:23.464
(gasps) But why?

16:23.558 --> 16:26.317
You think she's, like, trying
to get us mad at each other?

16:26.544 --> 16:29.320
Well, it would certainly
explain the voice mail I got.

16:29.547 --> 16:31.138
<i> Hey, Chris,</i>
<i> Principal Shepherd here.</i>

16:31.157 --> 16:34.641
<i> So, listen, the nurse</i>
<i> is going to press charges</i>

16:34.661 --> 16:36.385
<i> for you touching her breast.</i>

16:36.404 --> 16:39.646
<i> I offered her the money</i>
<i> like you said, but, well,</i>

16:39.666 --> 16:41.165
<i> that seemed to make it worse.</i>

16:41.317 --> 16:43.001
<i> So, we either got to come up</i>
<i> on that number</i>

16:43.228 --> 16:44.544
<i> or find a different plan,</i>

16:44.695 --> 16:49.582
<i> but methinks a lawyer</i>
<i> is in our future. Hmph.</i>

16:49.734 --> 16:51.567
<i> Anyway, call me back,</i>

16:51.586 --> 16:55.905
<i>but remember the rule on these:</i>
<i> delete, delete, delete.</i>

16:55.998 --> 16:57.831
<i> AUTOMATED VOICE:</i>
<i> Message saved.</i>

16:57.925 --> 17:00.393
What kind of game
is Mom playing?

17:06.267 --> 17:09.193
("Palisades Park" playing)

17:12.365 --> 17:14.699
♪<i> Last night I took</i>
<i> a walk after dark</i> ♪

17:14.850 --> 17:17.851

♪<i> To have some fun</i>

17:21.041 --> 17:22.948
♪<i> That's where the girls are.</i> ♪

17:23.043 --> 17:25.651
Brian? What are you doing?

17:25.803 --> 17:27.378
Amber, please take me back.

17:27.530 --> 17:29.380
Look, I even brought you
a peace offering:

17:29.532 --> 17:31.532
a pack of cigarettes
and some Nicorette gum

17:31.626 --> 17:33.976
because I wasn't sure which way
you wanted to go this week.

17:34.112 --> 17:35.778
Aw, that's sweet.

17:35.797 --> 17:39.282
I'm-a smoke and chew them both
for an extra nicotine surge.

17:39.300 --> 17:41.375
It's what carnies call
"The Surf and Turf."

17:41.394 --> 17:42.709
Well, that doesn't
make much sense,

17:42.878 --> 17:44.287
but it sure is two things.

17:44.380 --> 17:47.214
Amber, we have
something special.

17:47.233 --> 17:49.125
I want us to grow mold together.

17:49.143 --> 17:51.218
Aw, me, too.

17:51.237 --> 17:53.296
And I'd love
to take you back, Brian,

17:53.389 --> 17:54.647
but if we're a couple,
that means

17:54.741 --> 17:56.908
you'd have to be willing
to come on the road

17:57.059 --> 17:59.135
and work the carnival with me.

17:59.304 --> 18:01.395
I mean, that's my life.

18:01.414 --> 18:03.397
Of course.
I'm totally up for that.

18:03.491 --> 18:04.140
Really?

18:04.233 --> 18:06.534
Aw, that's boss!

18:06.644 --> 18:07.734
Let's do it!

18:07.829 --> 18:09.495
Okay, great, so you
do take me back?

18:09.589 --> 18:11.831
Well, then, as long as we're
officially a couple again,

18:11.983 --> 18:13.316
I have something to say.

18:13.334 --> 18:15.484
Amber, if you think
for one second--

18:15.486 --> 18:19.672
Oh, my gosh, Uncle Earl, you got
to meet my new boyfriend Brian.

18:19.841 --> 18:21.324
Good to meet you, Brian.

18:21.417 --> 18:23.601
But don't you break
her heart, you hear?

18:23.828 --> 18:25.269
Last guy who treated her wrong

18:25.421 --> 18:27.271
had his scrotum
nail-clippered off,

18:27.498 --> 18:29.941
then got kicked to death
behind a Chick-fil-A.

18:30.168 --> 18:32.777
I assure you, my intentions
are strictly honorable.

18:32.928 --> 18:34.353
Okay, then.

18:34.505 --> 18:38.157
I'm just telling you this as
her uncle and her ex-boyfriend.

18:44.457 --> 18:45.681
Check it out, Chris.

18:45.850 --> 18:48.275
Your mom tries to turn us
against each other?

18:48.294 --> 18:50.369
Well, this ought to teach her
a thing or two.

18:50.446 --> 18:52.872
Your plan is to drop
a piano on Mom?

18:53.024 --> 18:53.873
No, not at all.

18:53.967 --> 18:56.116
See, your mother
loves this piano,

18:56.210 --> 18:57.969
and by stringing it up
in the air like this,

18:58.196 --> 18:59.971
she'll never be able
to touch it again.

19:00.122 --> 19:01.472
That's genius.

19:01.699 --> 19:04.367
My plan was just to suggest
something to you halfheartedly

19:04.460 --> 19:06.385
and then immediately back down
like a beta.

19:06.554 --> 19:07.887
I think we should
go with my plan.

19:07.981 --> 19:09.814
No, yeah,
your-your plan is better.

19:09.965 --> 19:12.208
Oh, hey, you two.
What's all this?

19:12.301 --> 19:13.484
Don't play dumb, Mom.

19:13.711 --> 19:15.802
Chris and I see you're
trying to push us apart.

19:15.897 --> 19:18.063
Yeah, we're your husband
and your son

19:18.216 --> 19:20.383
and we were actually getting
to know each other,

19:20.476 --> 19:24.662
but it seems like some part
of you wanted that to fail.

19:25.665 --> 19:27.890
Oh, you guys, I am so sorry.

19:27.909 --> 19:29.558
You're right.

19:29.652 --> 19:31.669
I guess, at first, I felt bad
you were making fun of me,

19:31.896 --> 19:34.321
and then later I resented
that you'd removed me entirely

19:34.340 --> 19:36.899
from any family decision-making.

19:36.992 --> 19:38.843
But what I did was awful.

19:38.994 --> 19:41.470
I genuinely hope you
can forgive me.

19:44.592 --> 19:48.577
Honestly, Lois, I'm not certain
I will be able to excuse this.

19:48.596 --> 19:52.081
But I pray that, with time,
healing may come.

19:52.099 --> 19:55.676
What? You do something crazy
basically once a week

19:55.695 --> 19:57.344
and I always forgive you.

19:57.363 --> 20:00.573
Fine. Get a Mark Davis haircut
and we'll call it even.

20:01.868 --> 20:03.367
I hate you for this, Peter.

20:03.519 --> 20:04.610
I know.

20:04.762 --> 20:07.246
Now let's go upstairs
and have idiot sex.

20:12.695 --> 20:14.103
Well, these last few days--

20:14.196 --> 20:16.288
-(piano crashing)
-Ahh! Son of a bitch!

20:16.365 --> 20:17.957
Dad never took the piano down.

20:18.109 --> 20:20.459
I think it just fell on Brian.

20:20.553 --> 20:23.279
He has had a bad week.

20:23.297 --> 20:26.039
(sighs) Anyway,
like I was saying,

20:26.059 --> 20:28.208
these last few days
have been quite an adventure,

20:28.228 --> 20:30.895
but I'm just happy that
everything is back to normal.

20:31.046 --> 20:33.456
Yes. And now I must away
to the sea,

20:33.549 --> 20:36.567
and hunt down the orca
that killed my Pappy.

20:36.794 --> 20:38.294
Be careful, my love,

20:38.312 --> 20:41.722
for no one truly knows
the secrets of the inky deep.

20:41.799 --> 20:43.966
Fare thee well, my love.
