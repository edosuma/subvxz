00:00.208 --> 00:02.625
(lively music playing)

00:02.709 --> 00:04.375
(J.D.) <i>Ah, Christmas Eve.</i>

00:04.750 --> 00:07.625
<i>Unfortunately, when you spend</i>
<i>every waking moment in the hospital,</i>

00:07.709 --> 00:09.500
<i>it's kinda hard to get into the spirit.</i>

00:09.583 --> 00:11.917
Are you aware
that you're in everyone's way?

00:13.792 --> 00:16.583
Everyone's way or your way?

00:17.458 --> 00:18.625
Think about it.

00:20.000 --> 00:21.417
You want me to think about it, huh?

00:21.500 --> 00:23.041
I'll let you think about it.

00:23.125 --> 00:26.166
(J.D.)
<i>Still, there are some traditions I enjoy,</i>

00:26.250 --> 00:30.291
<i>like Nurse Tisdale's 9:15 cup of coffee.</i>

00:30.375 --> 00:34.375
(sensual music playing)

00:47.208 --> 00:48.542
Carla, what time is it?

00:48.625 --> 00:51.875
Oh, I don't know, but I'm guessing
it's about, hmm, 9:15-ish?

00:52.458 --> 00:54.250
Oh, this thing?

00:56.125 --> 00:57.834
-Who put this up?
-(janitor) I did.

00:59.291 --> 01:00.375
I drove around the whole city

01:00.458 --> 01:03.959
before my 5 A.M. shift
just lookin' for that,

01:04.750 --> 01:06.250
tryin' to add a little cheer.

01:06.333 --> 01:08.625
Okay, heh heh.
You will not ruin my Christmas.

01:09.083 --> 01:11.834
Not again. Not this year.

01:13.875 --> 01:16.375
But I've only worked here for 3 months.

01:16.458 --> 01:17.709
(J.D.) <i>Ah, things could be worse.</i>

01:17.792 --> 01:20.709
<i>I could be with Elliot</i>
<i>doing my mandatory day in the free clinic.</i>

01:20.792 --> 01:23.333
I understand that you took a cab
all the way down here.

01:23.417 --> 01:26.709
That doesn't mean that I can give you
Vicodin because your teeth are itchy.

01:27.542 --> 01:28.667
Dr. Kelso.

01:28.750 --> 01:31.375
You know,
I don't want to sound insensitive,

01:31.458 --> 01:34.083
but why don't these people have any money?

01:34.166 --> 01:38.000
Uh, I don't know, sir.
They probably waste it all on food.

01:38.083 --> 01:40.542
Dr. Kelso, I need to precept a patient...

01:40.625 --> 01:42.375
19-year-old complaining of abdominal pain,

01:42.458 --> 01:44.083
turns out she's at least
8 months pregnant.

01:44.166 --> 01:46.333
I'm just gonna let one
of the family practice people handle it.

01:46.417 --> 01:48.417
Well, that sounds like
a wonderful idea, sweetheart,

01:48.500 --> 01:51.125
except I heard your smart-aleck remark
a second ago,

01:51.208 --> 01:53.375
so why don't you just keep
your little pregnant girl?

01:53.917 --> 01:55.417
It'll be good practice for you

01:55.500 --> 01:58.291
since you'll probably end up
in a female specialty anyway.

01:58.375 --> 01:59.291
(chuckles)

01:59.375 --> 02:01.792
What do you mean by that?
I'm internal medicine.

02:01.875 --> 02:03.709
Well, of course you are...
(chuckles)

02:04.625 --> 02:06.458
But numbers don't lie,
and most women end up

02:06.542 --> 02:09.500
in ob-gyn, family practice, or pediatrics.

02:09.583 --> 02:13.000
It's like a riptide, sweetheart,
pulling and pulling,

02:13.083 --> 02:16.000
and you can swim
against the current all you want,

02:16.083 --> 02:18.083
but when Mr. Stork comes a-calling,

02:18.166 --> 02:20.000
you're not gonna be thinkin',
"I'm internal medicine."

02:20.083 --> 02:21.834
Nope. It's gonna be...

02:22.500 --> 02:24.542
(female voice)
"Oh...

02:24.625 --> 02:27.542
Look at the baby."

02:27.625 --> 02:30.000
Sir, I have to say I'm offended.

02:30.083 --> 02:33.959
Oh, no. Now I have to go buy flowers
to make it right.

02:36.542 --> 02:40.208

02:40.291 --> 02:43.166

02:53.375 --> 02:56.166
Oh, what a good boy you are.

02:56.250 --> 02:59.667
Dear God, Judy,
how much product do you use?

02:59.750 --> 03:01.583
None. It's like this when I wake up.

03:01.667 --> 03:03.834
Yeah, quick tip there sports star.

03:03.917 --> 03:06.000
When you're defensive
about your feminine side,

03:06.083 --> 03:07.458
it just makes you seem more girly.

03:10.291 --> 03:11.625
-I assume you want something.
-Easy.

03:11.709 --> 03:15.208
Nobody likes a cranky punching bag,
and yes, it's about a patient...

03:15.291 --> 03:16.917
A pretty good friend of mine, actually.

03:17.000 --> 03:19.458

<i>he respects me a little.</i>

03:19.542 --> 03:20.375
Huh.

03:21.166 --> 03:23.333
Hey, Randy, Jackie, what do you say?

03:23.417 --> 03:26.709
This is the monkey I got
to videotape the birth.

03:27.625 --> 03:28.750

03:29.500 --> 03:31.667

<i>to fix him.</i>

I'm sorry, but it's been 2 weeks,

04:00.250 --> 04:02.458
and your son shows
no neurological improvement.

04:02.542 --> 04:03.458
(grunts)

04:04.709 --> 04:07.458
First of all, the man was damn near dead,

04:07.542 --> 04:09.291
-and then he comes out...
-You are ridiculous.

04:09.375 --> 04:12.291
He was damn near...
J.D., I'm tellin' you, it was a miracle.

04:12.375 --> 04:13.500
It was not a miracle.

04:13.583 --> 04:15.250
Yes, it was a miracle. Dude...

04:15.333 --> 04:16.834
(J.D.) <i>I kind of envy Turk</i>

04:16.917 --> 04:19.583
<i>to be that sure of something,</i>
<i>to have that faith.</i>

04:19.667 --> 04:22.417
<i>Of course, that doesn't mean</i>
<i>I don't love busting him about it.</i>

04:22.500 --> 04:25.709
Okay, so you think God
was responsible for his recovery.

04:25.792 --> 04:28.667
-Uh-huh.
-That's fine. We all have our beliefs.

04:28.750 --> 04:32.625
I, for instance, carry around this tiny,
little monopoly piece for good luck.

04:32.709 --> 04:35.709
Did you just compare my lord and savior
to a tiny top hat?

04:35.792 --> 04:37.959
He did. I heard him, baby. Go get him.

04:38.041 --> 04:40.125
Oh, excuse me, Nurse Teresa.

04:40.625 --> 04:42.125
Have you ever read the Bible?

04:42.208 --> 04:43.417
I started it,

04:43.500 --> 04:45.750
but then I skipped to the end,
and it ruined it for me.

04:46.458 --> 04:48.625
That's it.
The both of you to the window. Let's go.

04:48.709 --> 04:50.166
-(Carla) I'm goin'.
-(Turk) Right now.

04:52.417 --> 04:56.834

05:03.750 --> 05:05.750
I understand what you're saying, baby.

05:05.834 --> 05:06.917
Oh, no, no, please.

05:07.000 --> 05:09.041
You can't just jump back on my good side.

05:09.792 --> 05:11.291
You see all this right here...

05:11.875 --> 05:14.458

-It will last.
-Oh, yeah?

05:22.000 --> 05:23.625
-It's gonna last.
-What if I came up to you

05:23.709 --> 05:25.250
all tired, you know, and I just...

05:26.333 --> 05:27.500
I had to yawn.

05:28.083 --> 05:28.917
Ooh.

05:31.166 --> 05:32.208
Damn!

05:34.583 --> 05:35.542
How pathetic is that?

05:35.625 --> 05:38.500
Do it again. Please.

05:38.583 --> 05:41.458
Oh. This is from last night...

05:41.542 --> 05:43.542
The Christmas tree over at Miller Park.

05:43.959 --> 05:46.917
God, I love that tree.
It's so beautiful, isn't it?

05:47.542 --> 05:49.000
I've been there
almost every night this week.

05:49.083 --> 05:51.041
Listen, Meredith, you're pregnant...

05:52.000 --> 05:53.667
And pretty far along, actually.

05:53.750 --> 05:56.083
What? That's not possible.

05:56.667 --> 05:58.625
What am I supposed to do?

05:58.709 --> 06:03.542
Oh, look at the baby.

06:04.834 --> 06:06.709
Um, babies aren't really my thing,

06:06.792 --> 06:09.834
so, uh, I'm just gonna go
get you someone else to talk to.

06:13.458 --> 06:16.333
Oh, come on.
It's great to see you guys again, really.

06:16.417 --> 06:18.291
All 3 of you.
(laughs)

06:19.583 --> 06:22.375
What is it with friends and the whole
wanting to be in your life thing?

06:22.458 --> 06:24.166
It's selfish is what it is.

06:24.250 --> 06:26.458
I thought I got Randy
and Jackie in the divorce.

06:26.542 --> 06:28.083
(J.D.) <i>Oh, my God, his ex-wife.</i>

06:28.166 --> 06:29.250
<i>The tension actually hurts.</i>

06:29.834 --> 06:32.417
<i>You have to break it.</i>
<i>Say something. Anything!</i>

06:32.500 --> 06:33.458
Banana Hammock!

06:35.291 --> 06:37.583
I'm betting your ability
to thrive under pressure

06:37.667 --> 06:39.041
is what drove you to medicine.

06:39.125 --> 06:41.125
Oh, please. You should have seen him
when he was a new intern.

06:41.208 --> 06:44.291
"I... don't... want...
to... be... a... doctor."

06:44.375 --> 06:46.834
(both laugh)

06:47.458 --> 06:49.834
You know, I think we all know
that's just not true.

06:52.250 --> 06:55.959
I'm assuming since you already went ahead
and took everything else,

06:56.041 --> 06:58.125
that you're here for my self-respect,

06:58.208 --> 07:01.166
but there's bad news on that one,
sweet-cheeks.

07:01.250 --> 07:04.709
I already gave it to your mom
when she begged me to marry you.

07:04.792 --> 07:07.250
(laughs)
Whoo-hoo!

07:07.333 --> 07:08.792
Oh, I wouldn't have room for it anyway,

07:08.875 --> 07:10.709

in my trophy case.

07:12.500 --> 07:13.542
Holy cow.

What do you want for Christmas?

09:40.834 --> 09:41.667
Unh!

09:43.625 --> 09:45.041
I know you must be busy.

09:45.792 --> 09:47.625
It's really nice of you
to offer to do this.

09:48.625 --> 09:50.458
Oh, it's no problem.

09:50.542 --> 09:53.542
(J.D.)
<i>Childbirth has been so romanticized.</i>

09:53.625 --> 09:56.041
<i>I guess because if people</i>
<i>really knew the truth...</i>

09:56.458 --> 09:59.792
(Narrator)
<i>Congratulations! You're expecting.</i>

09:59.875 --> 10:03.959
<i>Don't worry. Your doctor will tell you</i>
<i>everything you need to know.</i>

10:04.417 --> 10:05.500
<i>Hi, doctor.</i>

10:05.583 --> 10:09.583
You'll fart, pee, puke, and poop
in front of 10 complete strangers

10:09.667 --> 10:12.417
who will be staring intently
at your vagina,

10:12.500 --> 10:16.208
which, by the way,
has an 80% chance of tearing.

10:18.166 --> 10:19.000
You do it.

10:20.291 --> 10:22.166
(J.D.)
<i>Still, no matter what the realities,</i>

10:22.792 --> 10:24.667
<i>the end result is always the same.</i>

10:24.750 --> 10:27.291
(baby cries)

10:27.375 --> 10:29.083
Oh, look at the baby.

10:29.166 --> 10:31.959
It's a bouncing baby boy!

10:32.041 --> 10:36.166
Yet, another soldier
in the fight against communism.

10:37.875 --> 10:41.667
(quirky music playing)

10:43.667 --> 10:46.667
-Where's the girl that was in here?
-I just make beds.

10:46.750 --> 10:47.792
(sighs)

10:50.583 --> 10:52.417
Hello, I just got Meredith Fox's
blood work back,

10:52.500 --> 10:53.458
and she's got HELLP syndrome.

10:53.542 --> 10:55.959
She needs to deliver immediately,
so let's get her in a room and...

10:56.917 --> 10:58.208
What do you mean, she just left?

10:59.917 --> 11:01.208
Get me any contact numbers.

11:02.583 --> 11:03.583
Why did she leave?

11:03.667 --> 11:06.208
Again, bed-maker.

11:07.709 --> 11:08.583
(sighs)

11:10.000 --> 11:13.250
(Dr. Cox) Newbie,
I always punch the tabs out of my tapes

11:13.333 --> 11:15.875
so there's no possible way
they can be recorded over,

11:15.959 --> 11:17.875
so please tell me

11:17.959 --> 11:20.834
you didn't use the tape
that was already in the camera.

11:22.041 --> 11:22.917
Banana Hammock.

11:23.458 --> 11:27.375
So, in other words,
there is no permanent historical record

11:27.458 --> 11:29.583
of the birth of my friend's baby.

11:30.792 --> 11:33.792
Well, you know, I...
I think that the baby itself

11:33.875 --> 11:39.208
would serve as proof that it was,
you know, born.

11:41.291 --> 11:43.083
You don't understand what you've done.

11:43.667 --> 11:47.125
My ex-wife is probably gonna hold this
over my head for so long

11:47.208 --> 11:49.417
that I doubt I'll ever see
the sun again...

11:50.250 --> 11:52.000
And I like the sun, newbie.

11:52.583 --> 11:53.959
It made me hopeful.

11:54.875 --> 11:56.667
Well, I was there, you know.

11:56.750 --> 12:02.417
I could certainly jot down
some of my feelings and impressions.

12:04.375 --> 12:05.875
(J.D.)
<i>You know, if he was really mad at me,</i>

12:05.959 --> 12:07.250
<i>he would have stayed and yelled at me.</i>

12:07.959 --> 12:09.083
<i>Don't kid yourself, newbie.</i>

12:09.166 --> 12:10.709
<i>I couldn't be any madder at you.</i>

12:12.291 --> 12:16.834
<i>Oh, no! Do not do that again. Bad newbie.</i>

12:16.917 --> 12:19.583
<i>Hold that. Hold that. Okay, no...</i>

12:19.667 --> 12:21.000
(J.D.) <i>At least I can go home now.</i>

12:21.583 --> 12:24.166
<i>You see, maybe it's because</i>
<i>Christmas is a hard time for people.</i>

12:24.250 --> 12:26.458
<i>Maybe it's because</i>
<i>too many families get together,</i>

12:26.542 --> 12:27.417
<i>but statistically,</i>

12:27.500 --> 12:31.166

I can't believe I'm wearing a suit
at 6:30 in the morning.

13:18.208 --> 13:20.000
If you ruin this for Turk,
I'll have to hurt you.

13:20.083 --> 13:20.917
Noted.

13:23.291 --> 13:25.291
Hey, you better hurry up.

13:25.375 --> 13:26.875
Mass starts in 15 minutes.

13:26.959 --> 13:28.083
I'm not goin'.

13:28.166 --> 13:29.583
Great. Can I go back to bed?

13:30.458 --> 13:32.000
I'm kidding. Let's do it.

13:32.083 --> 13:33.625
I wanna get me some of them
church crackers.

13:33.709 --> 13:35.125
No, I'm not goin'...

13:35.834 --> 13:36.667
Ever.

13:38.208 --> 13:41.917
-Baby, what happened?
-(door closes)

13:42.000 --> 13:44.250
Turk. Turk, come on.

13:46.000 --> 13:47.375
(J.D.) <i>Merry Christmas.</i>

13:50.250 --> 13:51.667
I think you're overreacting.

13:51.750 --> 13:53.667
A young, pregnant girl said,
"What am I gonna do?,"

13:53.750 --> 13:55.083
and I said, "Oh, babies aren't my thing."

13:55.166 --> 13:57.041
How could I possibly be too hard
on myself?

13:57.667 --> 13:59.250
(J.D.) <i>Don't say, "banana Hammock."</i>

14:00.333 --> 14:02.041
Look, I'm sure she'll turn up.

14:02.709 --> 14:04.458
Yeah, that's exactly what's gonna happen.

14:04.542 --> 14:07.333
She'll definitely turn up,
and she'll have a healthy baby,

14:07.417 --> 14:09.583
and nothing will ever happen
to either one of 'em.

14:11.291 --> 14:13.792
(J.D.) <i>I never really thought of faith</i>
<i>as important,</i>

14:13.875 --> 14:15.625
<i>but without his... I don't know...</i>

14:16.041 --> 14:18.583
<i>Turk kinda seems like he's fading away.</i>

14:20.500 --> 14:22.208
<i>Me, I could use a little faith.</i>

14:22.291 --> 14:24.041
<i>I have to tell the wheelers</i>
<i>I didn't tape a thing.</i>

14:24.125 --> 14:27.500
You made some interesting choices
with the camera, Orson.

14:27.583 --> 14:29.000
You didn't wanna see any faces?

14:29.583 --> 14:30.542
Excuse me?

14:30.625 --> 14:32.500
I switched the tapes. Just go with it.

14:32.583 --> 14:34.792
Here he comes. I see the head.

14:34.875 --> 14:36.917
Oh, what a gorgeous head of hair.

14:37.000 --> 14:41.083
That's funny. He was completely bald
when he was in here a few minutes ago.

14:41.166 --> 14:42.208
Yeah, well...

14:42.291 --> 14:43.375
We shaved the baby.

14:43.458 --> 14:44.709
You shaved the baby?

14:45.291 --> 14:46.208
Shaved it.

14:46.834 --> 14:48.208
Well, it's standard procedure,

14:48.291 --> 14:50.959
what with the recent outbreak
of prenatal lice.

14:51.041 --> 14:52.834
Yep. Definitely.

14:53.667 --> 14:55.375
Shave and a haircut...

14:57.417 --> 14:58.625
2 bits.

14:59.208 --> 15:00.083
Really?

15:03.834 --> 15:05.375
Yeah, I'm not buying it.

15:06.208 --> 15:09.208
And you two are gonna go by the nursery
and see baby Charlie, right?

15:09.291 --> 15:11.041
-Absolutely.
-Yes...

15:11.125 --> 15:12.583
Charlie and his new haircut.

15:13.250 --> 15:14.542
(both) Oh.

15:17.792 --> 15:19.542
Have we checked all the other hospitals?

15:19.625 --> 15:20.959
They haven't seen her, honey.

15:24.000 --> 15:26.250
Dr. Reid. Isn't this your day off?

15:26.333 --> 15:28.625
Actually, it's that pregnant girl
I was telling you about.

15:28.709 --> 15:30.542
Oh, right. The one who went missing...

15:30.625 --> 15:35.458
And now you're here
voluntarily hellbent on finding

15:35.542 --> 15:37.875
one of your little lost ducklings.

15:37.959 --> 15:40.291
Dr. Kelso, I think it's important
you understand something.

15:40.375 --> 15:43.792
I'm not interested in babies.
I don't coo when I'm around them.

15:43.875 --> 15:44.917
I don't melt when I see them.

15:45.000 --> 15:47.250
I don't have some yearning
to make them my life's work.

15:47.333 --> 15:50.458
I'm a doctor who's interested
in my patients, male or female,

15:50.542 --> 15:52.083
and right now, one of them needs help.

15:52.667 --> 15:56.583
(laughs)
God, do I know women.

15:59.667 --> 16:01.500
I don't get it. Why are we on the roof?

16:02.291 --> 16:03.583
I just wanted to show you

16:03.667 --> 16:06.458
that no matter how ugly things
can get down there,

16:06.542 --> 16:08.750
there's still a lot of beauty up here.

16:10.250 --> 16:14.500
Is that gum or pigeon crap on my sneaker?

16:15.125 --> 16:17.208
Come on. Look around.

16:17.750 --> 16:20.542
There's nobody here. No one can see us.

16:20.625 --> 16:22.667
We could do whatever we wanted.

16:24.166 --> 16:25.041
Like what?

16:25.125 --> 16:26.834
Okay, how are you not getting this?

16:27.458 --> 16:30.417
Oh, you... you mean have relations.
(laughs)

16:30.500 --> 16:32.417
You wanna have relations
right here on the roof?

16:32.500 --> 16:33.417
Mm-hmm.

16:33.500 --> 16:35.083
Baby, there's a lot of pebbles
on the ground.

16:35.166 --> 16:37.166
It'll make my ass look like
a chocolate chocolate chip.

16:37.250 --> 16:40.542
I can make you see God again,
or at least call out his name.

16:42.125 --> 16:43.250
Is this a joke to you?

16:44.333 --> 16:46.583
No, I'm just trying to help you
feel better.

16:46.667 --> 16:48.375
Baby, you don't know how I feel.

16:48.458 --> 16:49.625
Well, then, tell me.

16:49.709 --> 16:51.041
I feel abandoned!

16:53.542 --> 16:56.750
All my life, I've believed
that god listens to our prayers

16:56.834 --> 16:59.500
and that he cares for us
and that he watches over us...

17:01.250 --> 17:04.500
And last night, there were so many people
that needed to be watched over.

17:07.458 --> 17:09.041
How am I supposed to believe in someone

17:09.125 --> 17:11.750
that is willing to let
innocent people suffer?

17:13.166 --> 17:15.959
Huh? Answer me, please.

17:17.959 --> 17:19.166
I can't.

17:23.333 --> 17:24.500
Did you go see baby Charlie yet?

17:24.583 --> 17:27.000
Oh, yeah. I was actually
just planning on doing that.

17:27.083 --> 17:28.083
Never.

17:28.166 --> 17:30.125
You're such a special friend.

17:30.208 --> 17:33.250
Oh, gosh, Marjorie,
aren't you sassy today?

17:33.333 --> 17:37.417
Did Santa finally bring you
that "Y" chromosome you always wanted?

17:37.500 --> 17:39.125
What's your problem, anyway?

17:39.208 --> 17:41.375
Well, for starters, I hate Christmas.

17:42.166 --> 17:45.709
I don't like bambersnoodles.
I loathe dinkerwallows.

17:45.792 --> 17:48.417
I hate snagtumgoopers.

17:49.041 --> 17:50.917
I say, do you follow?

17:52.500 --> 17:53.667
Do you think I'm a moron?

17:53.750 --> 17:56.000
Newbie, don't answer that question.

17:56.083 --> 17:57.375
It's a trick. That's a trick.

17:57.458 --> 18:02.417
Oh, prenatal lice? You do realize
that would be lice in the womb?

18:02.500 --> 18:04.709
Oh, I've seen 'em.
They're real, and they're gross.

18:04.792 --> 18:06.875
(J.D.)
<i>Maybe Dr. Cox has pushed me too far.</i>

18:06.959 --> 18:09.000
<i>I don't know.</i>
<i>Whatever it was, I told on him.</i>

18:09.083 --> 18:10.750
Plus, he didn't even go see
baby Charlie yet.

18:11.834 --> 18:13.750
(J.D.)
<i>And then, something amazing happened.</i>

18:13.834 --> 18:17.750
<i>They connected,</i>
<i>and all the hatred they had for each other</i>

18:17.834 --> 18:20.166
<i>was suddenly focused on me.</i>

18:20.834 --> 18:22.083
Excuse me, Sally sensitive.

18:22.166 --> 18:24.208
I don't remember asking you anything.

18:24.291 --> 18:27.792
Your mom's aware that she'll eventually
have to stop the breast feeding, right?

18:27.875 --> 18:31.667
Whoo! Good, Jordan, good.
Now work the body. Work the body.

18:31.750 --> 18:34.250
-Under the ribs. Under the ribs.
-I'm not gonna see that baby, either.

18:34.333 --> 18:36.750
Are you gonna tattle on me?
Are ya? Are ya?

18:36.834 --> 18:38.750
-(Imitates baby crying)
-Ooh, I'm frightened.

18:38.834 --> 18:40.750
-J.D., do you have a second?
-Oh, God, yes.

18:40.834 --> 18:42.500
(Miss Sullivan) That's right.
Ran away, Sally.

18:42.583 --> 18:43.709
I talked to a 911 operator

18:43.792 --> 18:45.458
who got a call from
this young girl who was in labor,

18:45.542 --> 18:46.500
but they lost the signal.

18:46.583 --> 18:47.667
I don't know what to do.

<i>especially the way they bring the people</i>
<i>around them together.</i>

20:00.917 --> 20:03.000
So, baby Charlie is the bald one?

20:03.083 --> 20:03.917
Yeah.

20:04.542 --> 20:07.208
He wouldn't be smiling so much
if he knew how ugly his parents were.

20:07.291 --> 20:09.333
(laughs)

20:09.417 --> 20:10.458
You're a sexy bitch.

20:10.875 --> 20:11.917
Thanks.

20:12.000 --> 20:14.083
-(both laugh)
-Aw, jeez. Come here.

20:15.750 --> 20:18.250
(J.D.) <i>Either way,</i>
<i>it's impossible to be unaffected...</i>

20:19.000 --> 20:22.792
What up, little dog?
(cackles)

20:22.875 --> 20:25.834
(J.D.) <i>Because a baby can stir</i>
<i>something deep down inside you</i>

20:25.917 --> 20:27.542
<i>you didn't even know was there.</i>

20:27.625 --> 20:30.834
Aw, look at the baby.

20:30.917 --> 20:33.792
(J.D.) <i>It can help you find</i>
<i>something you thought you'd lost.</i>

20:33.875 --> 20:35.667
How did you know she was here?

20:36.375 --> 20:37.750
I don't know. I just knew.

20:39.542 --> 20:41.333
(J.D.) <i>So I guess</i>
<i>Turk was right after all.</i>

20:42.041 --> 20:43.125
<i>Miracles do happen.</i>

20:46.875 --> 20:49.875
(solemn music playing)

20:59.917 --> 21:02.583
<i>I think you just have to be willing</i>
<i>to look for them.</i>

21:06.542 --> 21:08.083
Merry Christmas, guys.

21:12.083 --> 21:14.583
God bless us, every one.

21:15.250 --> 21:17.041
Dude, you could not be a bigger dork.

21:17.125 --> 21:18.041
(chuckles)

21:18.125 --> 21:19.250
You're so lame.

21:19.333 --> 21:20.750
That was so cheesy.

21:20.834 --> 21:23.083
Really? 'Cause I felt like it was...
it was right.
