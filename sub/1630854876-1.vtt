WEBVTT

00:41.834 --> 00:43.181
Mr. Maguire.

00:43.319 --> 00:44.975
At last, we meet.

00:45.114 --> 00:46.184
Pleasure.

00:46.322 --> 00:48.048
My son was impressed
with your offer.

00:48.186 --> 00:51.499
And given what I'm
looking at, so am I.

00:51.637 --> 00:53.501
<i>Oh, he's got a voice
for radio, huh?</i>

00:53.639 --> 00:55.469
I'm such a sucker
for an Irish accent,

00:55.607 --> 00:56.642
even on a gangster.

00:56.780 --> 00:57.885
<i>♪ Oh ♪</i>

00:58.023 --> 01:00.094
Ooh.
Look, a mystery guest.

01:00.232 --> 01:02.096
<i>♪ You're gonna lose
your soul ♪</i>

01:02.234 --> 01:04.995
<i>All right, Charlie,
it's time to work your magic.</i>

01:05.134 --> 01:07.343
Please, right this way.

01:07.481 --> 01:09.172
<i>♪ You're gonna lose
your soul ♪</i>

01:09.310 --> 01:11.416
How are we looking?

01:11.554 --> 01:14.246
Well, it's not the paperwork
that worries me.

01:14.384 --> 01:17.215
What's odd is his willingness
to sell us this warehouse

01:17.353 --> 01:19.734
at a discount,
take crypto over cash.

01:23.221 --> 01:26.914
Respectfully, only one reason
folks in your line of work

01:27.052 --> 01:29.089
want to buy a warehouse
near the port under the table,

01:29.227 --> 01:32.575
and it's not exactly legal.

01:32.713 --> 01:34.749
I forgot, how did you say
you and Connor

01:34.887 --> 01:36.234
came to know one another?

01:36.372 --> 01:38.374
Oh, I didn't.

01:41.998 --> 01:43.896
I'm sorry.
I don't know who she is.

01:44.034 --> 01:47.072
My deal's with your son.

01:47.210 --> 01:48.901
Mr. Maguire, can we talk?

01:52.388 --> 01:54.424
What's going on?

01:54.562 --> 01:55.908
We need to walk.

01:58.670 --> 02:00.085
<i>Hey, this could be
a problem.</i>

02:02.570 --> 02:03.571
She's trying
to get him to walk.

02:10.509 --> 02:12.718
The hell do you think
you're going?

02:12.856 --> 02:15.065
I didn't realize she was
the one calling the shots.

02:15.204 --> 02:16.101
She's not.

02:17.758 --> 02:19.277
Could have fooled me.

02:23.729 --> 02:25.731
Enough.

02:25.869 --> 02:27.595
Let's get on with it.

02:44.440 --> 02:46.338
I'll need to confirm
the funds.

02:53.621 --> 02:55.347
OK.

02:55.485 --> 02:56.693
Sign the transfer
of ownership,

02:56.831 --> 02:58.143
and we are--
- Shh.

02:58.281 --> 02:59.455
Chopper.

02:59.593 --> 03:01.802
We got to go--now!

03:01.940 --> 03:03.804
Put it back!

03:03.942 --> 03:05.461
Put it back!

03:05.599 --> 03:08.188
Did you set me up?
Did you set me up?

03:14.608 --> 03:17.921
FBI!
On the ground--now!

03:18.059 --> 03:20.372
On the ground!

03:33.834 --> 03:35.767
That was a lot of mustard
on that sandwich, Pop.

03:35.905 --> 03:38.287
What?

03:38.425 --> 03:39.391
I've got to commit to sell it.

03:39.529 --> 03:40.703
Ah, I think you oversold it.

03:40.841 --> 03:42.325
Here!
Let me.

03:44.500 --> 03:45.639
Did you get it?

03:45.777 --> 03:46.847
Yeah.

03:46.985 --> 03:47.882
Of course I got it.

03:48.020 --> 03:50.851
Mm.

03:50.989 --> 03:52.749
I'm thinking we keep these
for the honeymoon.

03:52.887 --> 03:55.165
- Oh, Jesus. Unsubscribe.
- Oh, yeah.

03:55.304 --> 03:56.201
At least
he's in a relationship.

03:56.339 --> 03:57.582
You know what, Mom?

03:57.720 --> 03:59.687
I am the only reason
you have a grandchild.

04:01.206 --> 04:02.656
Hey, great timing
on that chopper.

04:02.794 --> 04:04.520
Yeah, the words
"rooftop" and "sniper"

04:04.658 --> 04:06.660
put a real pep in the step
of the Baltimore PD.

04:06.798 --> 04:08.386
- 621, Pop.
- Right, right.

04:08.524 --> 04:09.594
- 621.
- Yeah, yeah.

04:09.732 --> 04:10.560
Yeah, right.
I got it.

04:10.698 --> 04:11.596
I got it. I got it.

04:14.392 --> 04:15.703
Hey, let's get out of here
before they realize

04:15.841 --> 04:17.878
they were buying a warehouse
we didn't own.

04:19.707 --> 04:21.088
Look, I get it.

04:21.226 --> 04:23.055
By this point in my life,
I should have two kids

04:23.193 --> 04:24.919
and a husband
on the partner track.

04:25.057 --> 04:26.058
But guess what, Mom.

04:26.196 --> 04:28.751
I'm not you.

04:28.889 --> 04:32.030
She's reminding me of my
geriatric pregnancy years.

04:32.168 --> 04:34.377
Yeah, well, Kevin's been
working late a lot,

04:34.515 --> 04:35.689
so I doubt he'll make it.

04:35.827 --> 04:37.587
But I will ask, promise.

04:37.725 --> 04:39.244
I'm getting called
into a meeting, Mom.

04:39.382 --> 04:41.211
Got to go.
I'll talk to you later.

04:52.015 --> 04:54.017
You're welcome.

04:54.155 --> 04:55.640
What am I thanking you for?

04:55.778 --> 04:57.089
That signal in the noise
you were looking for?

04:57.227 --> 04:58.574
I think we found it.

05:01.266 --> 05:02.819
I knew it.

05:02.957 --> 05:05.305
Wherever one of these
distribution hubs pop up,

05:05.443 --> 05:08.963
a spike in fentanyl overdoses
soon follows.

05:09.101 --> 05:11.552
You're looking at the largest
drug trafficking ring

05:11.690 --> 05:13.140
in Europe,
hiding in plain sight

05:13.278 --> 05:16.143
behind a series of shills
and numbered corporations.

05:16.281 --> 05:17.903
And if I'm right,
they're about to make

05:18.041 --> 05:19.940
a big push into the U.S.

05:20.078 --> 05:23.115
So we know the what
and the how, just not the who.

05:23.253 --> 05:25.290
Not just yet,
but now I know where to look.

05:37.578 --> 05:39.062
<i>Room service!</i>

05:39.200 --> 05:41.582
Ordered us the good stuff.

05:41.720 --> 05:42.963
Emma!

05:43.101 --> 05:45.068
Hey, wait!
You can't just barge in here!

05:45.206 --> 05:45.966
Emma, what are you doing here?

05:46.104 --> 05:47.105
Emma!

05:48.417 --> 05:49.832
Oh, my God.

05:49.970 --> 05:52.317
Are you cheating on me?

05:52.455 --> 05:54.112
Nice.

05:54.250 --> 05:55.424
<i>How long?</i>

05:55.562 --> 05:57.253
Must have been a while.

05:57.391 --> 05:59.497
Stacy seemed pretty torn up.

05:59.635 --> 06:01.844
Three months.

06:01.982 --> 06:03.052
Why not just tell me?

06:04.985 --> 06:08.402
Oh, come on, Em.

06:08.540 --> 06:10.577
Can you honestly say
that you're in love with me?

06:15.513 --> 06:17.446
I can't believe
we pulled that off.

06:17.584 --> 06:18.826
You were amazing back there.

06:18.964 --> 06:20.966
We were amazing.
Hey, you ready to celebrate?

06:21.104 --> 06:22.105
Because somebody
might have booked

06:22.243 --> 06:23.659
the penthouse suite
at the Langston.

06:27.801 --> 06:29.630
By this time tomorrow,
we'll be en route to Italy.

06:29.768 --> 06:31.183
And then?

06:31.321 --> 06:32.978
Whatever we want
till the money runs out.

06:34.773 --> 06:36.326
Hey.

06:36.465 --> 06:38.674
You know the best part
about happily ever after?

06:38.812 --> 06:41.193
I don't know, discovering
that it actually exists?

06:41.331 --> 06:42.919
Mm.

06:43.057 --> 06:44.852
You don't know what comes next.

06:44.990 --> 06:46.440
Yeah, yeah.

06:46.578 --> 06:48.131
Hey, ditch the truck.
I'll see you back at the bar.

06:58.556 --> 07:02.422
<i>♪ Last night,

07:02.560 --> 07:03.837

Come on. Get up.

07:03.975 --> 07:05.528
Let's go.

07:07.737 --> 07:10.360
You lovebirds decide
on a destination yet?

07:10.499 --> 07:11.845
Oh, he won't
let go of Mexico,

07:11.983 --> 07:13.398
and I won't budge on Spain.

07:13.536 --> 07:14.606
Why not both, huh?

07:14.744 --> 07:16.332
Repeat after me, son:

07:16.470 --> 07:19.059
marriage is compromise.

07:19.197 --> 07:20.681
- You're telling me.
- Bird!

07:20.819 --> 07:22.234
Come on.

07:22.372 --> 07:23.891
We just pulled off
the biggest job of our lives.

07:24.029 --> 07:25.859
I'm sure you can spare
one second to celebrate.

07:25.997 --> 07:27.136
Yeah, call me conservative.

07:27.274 --> 07:30.311
I like the small scores,
under the radar.

07:30.450 --> 07:32.313
What we just did
makes me nervous.

07:32.452 --> 07:33.867
You got to gamble big
if you want to win big.

07:34.005 --> 07:36.386
I will celebrate
once I transfer the funds

07:36.525 --> 07:38.147
into the offshore account
I set up.

07:38.285 --> 07:40.080
Can you hand me
the cold wallet?

07:40.218 --> 07:42.462
Sure can.

08:01.688 --> 08:02.723
Charlie.

08:02.861 --> 08:04.104
Charlie!

08:04.242 --> 08:05.415
Call her right now!

08:06.796 --> 08:08.211
Call who?

08:08.349 --> 08:09.247

08:15.909 --> 08:17.635
<i>The number you've dialed

<i>disconnected,

08:44.524 --> 08:47.941
Vodka martini,
rocks, extra dirty.

08:48.079 --> 08:49.943
Decisive.
I like it.

08:50.081 --> 08:52.359
I've had...
A bit of a day,

08:52.497 --> 08:55.120
so whatever this is, hard pass.

08:55.258 --> 08:56.121
You want to talk about it?

08:56.259 --> 08:58.296
I'm a very good listener.

09:00.298 --> 09:02.024
How was Hawaii?

09:02.162 --> 09:03.266
You have fun with the fam?

09:04.751 --> 09:06.269
Sunburn's starting to peel.

09:08.099 --> 09:11.240
Trace of purple nail polish
from your daughter... or son.

09:11.378 --> 09:13.035
I don't want to be gendered.

09:13.173 --> 09:14.726
And then there's this.

09:14.864 --> 09:18.419
Oh, I drink mai tais now.

09:20.111 --> 09:22.354
And honestly, the cliché
tan line from your wedding ring

09:22.492 --> 09:24.322
was all I needed, so...

09:24.460 --> 09:26.255
whatever man-whore
business trip

09:26.393 --> 09:28.188
you're hoping to have
here in Charm City,

09:28.326 --> 09:29.638
it won't be with me.

09:29.776 --> 09:31.847
Cool.
Have a good one.

09:36.817 --> 09:37.818
Hawaii sounds nice.

09:47.345 --> 09:49.554
Relationships.

09:49.692 --> 09:52.246
What a racket.

09:52.384 --> 09:54.939
A shell game to conceal
who you really are.

09:55.077 --> 09:57.355
It's exhausting, isn't it?

09:57.493 --> 09:59.633
Lying to each
other all the time.

10:01.048 --> 10:03.119
But not just
lying to each other.

10:03.257 --> 10:06.398
I mean...
lying to ourselves, really.

10:15.684 --> 10:16.892
Whew.

10:17.030 --> 10:18.341
So what happened?

10:20.171 --> 10:22.000
She lied to me
about who she was.

10:22.138 --> 10:23.381
Mm.

10:23.519 --> 10:25.728
I'd promise
not to do the same, but...

10:25.866 --> 10:27.488
we both know
that'd be a lie.

10:31.907 --> 10:33.633
So what do you do?

10:37.740 --> 10:39.431
Oh, me?
I'm a--

10:42.227 --> 10:43.297
I'm a yoga instructor.

10:43.435 --> 10:44.229
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

10:44.367 --> 10:45.368
No man bun?

10:45.506 --> 10:46.749
I got rid of it last year.

10:46.887 --> 10:48.544
It was attracting
the wrong kind of attention.

10:48.682 --> 10:50.132
You?

10:50.270 --> 10:52.997
Oh, me?
I'm a...

10:53.135 --> 10:55.171

10:55.309 --> 10:56.656

10:59.589 --> 11:00.625
Well, I bet
those pageants really

11:02.765 --> 11:04.491
Oh, you have no idea.

11:04.629 --> 11:06.010
The only people more

13:29.256 --> 13:30.740
Wait.
You have to look me in the eye.

13:30.879 --> 13:32.742
Otherwise, it's seven years
of bad sex.

13:51.485 --> 13:53.108
- Morning.
- Morning.

14:34.943 --> 14:37.117
I showered.

14:37.255 --> 14:38.636
OK.

14:38.774 --> 14:42.812
I reeked of alcohol
and terrible decisions--

14:42.951 --> 14:44.676
not that you were
a bad decision.

14:44.814 --> 14:45.781
I mean, we didn't even--

14:45.919 --> 14:47.334
No.

14:47.472 --> 14:48.508
No, we didn't.

14:56.102 --> 14:58.828
So...

14:58.967 --> 15:00.969
what did you say
you do again?

15:03.764 --> 15:05.180
I'm a classical musician.

15:05.318 --> 15:07.492
Mm. Piano.

15:09.149 --> 15:10.840
Weirdly, no.

15:10.979 --> 15:12.187
Theremin.

15:13.360 --> 15:15.155
The theremin?

15:15.293 --> 15:17.675
The beauty of it is,

15:17.813 --> 15:18.952
it's all electricity.

15:20.643 --> 15:21.679
Hmm.

15:21.817 --> 15:24.371
You don't even
need to touch it.

15:40.491 --> 15:44.391
OK, Beatles or Stones?

15:44.529 --> 15:46.014
Stones, all day.

15:46.152 --> 15:48.395
- Every day.
- Yeah.

15:51.605 --> 15:53.228
A negroni, really?

15:54.677 --> 15:57.059
What?
I'm not a gin person.

15:57.197 --> 15:58.440
Yeah, you're not a gin person

15:58.578 --> 15:59.924
<i>till you've had
the perfect negroni.</i>

16:03.893 --> 16:05.550
Ooh.

16:05.688 --> 16:07.621
Barroom brawl?

16:07.759 --> 16:09.554
No, actually.

16:09.692 --> 16:11.867
Old roommate of mine

16:12.005 --> 16:13.903
tried to steal my apple.

16:14.042 --> 16:16.009
Put a blade in me
before I took it back.

16:16.147 --> 16:18.529
You almost lost your life
over a piece of fruit?

16:18.667 --> 16:20.876
No, not me.

16:21.014 --> 16:21.946
Him.

16:24.086 --> 16:25.674
<i>You got to take 'em.</i>

16:25.812 --> 16:28.711
I'm not stealing slippers.

16:28.849 --> 16:30.299
I'm a rule follower.

16:32.957 --> 16:35.649
See, the idea is

16:35.787 --> 16:38.342
to respect the orange.

16:38.480 --> 16:42.277
You draw the essence out
without the bitterness.

16:43.761 --> 16:47.627
<i>Maybe we just stay here,
do this.</i>

16:47.765 --> 16:49.146
For how long?

16:49.284 --> 16:50.630
Indefinitely.

16:54.392 --> 16:56.394
Fantasy is one thing, Charlie.

16:58.776 --> 17:00.467
Reality is another.

17:05.783 --> 17:06.818
Yeah.

17:19.107 --> 17:20.142
Hey.

17:20.280 --> 17:21.592
Heard about Tina.

17:23.145 --> 17:24.008
Sorry.

17:24.146 --> 17:25.837
Yeah.

17:25.975 --> 17:27.287
You were always
a bit of a romantic,

17:27.425 --> 17:28.909
even in the seventh grade.

17:29.979 --> 17:33.224
Look, you said you got
a line on a thing?

17:33.362 --> 17:35.916
'Cause I got to make up quick
for this last one.

17:36.848 --> 17:40.231
Yeah, we had a client,
some high roller from D.C.

17:40.369 --> 17:42.544
You know the type--
hired some girls,

17:42.682 --> 17:43.855
lots of drinks,
a lot of big swinging--

17:43.993 --> 17:45.064
Yup.

17:45.202 --> 17:48.239
Anyways,
there's this TV preacher,

17:48.377 --> 17:50.345
runs a megachurch in Arlington.

17:50.483 --> 17:52.864
One too many drinks,
makes it rain.

17:53.002 --> 17:55.764
Big stacks. I noticed.

17:55.902 --> 17:58.491
Seemed like the kind of guy
you'd want to know about.

17:58.629 --> 18:00.665
Yeah, he does.

18:00.803 --> 18:02.322
Usual deal?

18:02.460 --> 18:04.359
I make money,
you make money.

18:07.879 --> 18:10.089
- Hey, Charl.
- Yeah.

18:10.227 --> 18:11.849
If someone's got to level
the playing field

18:11.987 --> 18:14.438
for the rest of us,
I'm glad it's you.

19:01.864 --> 19:03.659
36 hours total AWOL.

19:05.558 --> 19:06.766
I was starting to think
your fake fiancée

19:06.904 --> 19:08.181
was your real fiancée
and the two of you

19:08.319 --> 19:09.803
planned this thing together.
- OK, Birdie.

19:09.941 --> 19:12.081
No, Mom, really not OK.

19:12.220 --> 19:14.118
I never wanted
to do a job this big.

19:14.256 --> 19:16.500
And now, thanks to Romeo's
romantic blind spot,

19:16.638 --> 19:18.295
not only are we out
10 million.

19:18.433 --> 19:21.229
We are flat broke.
- All right. All right, enough.

19:21.367 --> 19:23.265
What happened happened.

19:26.406 --> 19:28.270
We'll get through it.

19:28.408 --> 19:29.961
We always do.

19:31.963 --> 19:33.310
Yeah, Pop, forgive me
if I'm not really

19:33.448 --> 19:35.933

I'll fix this.

19:56.436 --> 19:58.542
I already got something
lined up.

20:00.613 --> 20:02.304
Don't worry about that
right now, kiddo.

20:04.341 --> 20:06.135
You just took a dagger
through the heart.

20:07.654 --> 20:08.793
Give it a minute.

20:11.244 --> 20:13.142
Do we have a minute to give?

20:13.281 --> 20:14.661
What do you mean?

20:14.799 --> 20:17.216
621.

20:17.354 --> 20:19.701
Code on the Pelican case?

20:19.839 --> 20:21.530
It's Ollie's birthday.

20:21.668 --> 20:23.670
Same code we've been using
since the day she was born.

20:26.880 --> 20:29.883
- Your mother tell you?
- Nah, she didn't need to.

20:30.021 --> 20:31.230
Don't worry about it.

20:31.368 --> 20:32.817
It's early stage, memory loss.
That's it.

20:32.955 --> 20:35.303
- Pop.
- We're not...

20:35.441 --> 20:36.994

20:41.792 --> 20:43.311

20:43.449 --> 20:46.866

20:47.004 --> 20:48.695
tell me what
you're thinking about.

20:51.491 --> 20:53.597
How do you feel about
taking from the hand of God?

20:55.771 --> 20:57.186
Oh.

21:08.128 --> 21:10.165
This is our target:

21:10.303 --> 21:13.099
Evan Earle III,
aka Pastor Earle.

21:13.237 --> 21:14.894
We cannot be late to church.

21:16.240 --> 21:17.345
<i>He's the lead pastor

than on TV.

21:33.084 --> 21:34.189
Don't you think so, honey?
- Oh, I do.

21:34.327 --> 21:35.639
- I mean, really.
- Oh!

21:35.777 --> 21:37.882
- Oh.
- Are you OK, ma'am?

21:38.020 --> 21:39.332
- Yes, thank you.
- I told her she's too old

21:39.470 --> 21:41.576
for four-inch heels,
but you know how it is.

21:41.714 --> 21:43.647
Closer to God,
that's what I say.

21:43.785 --> 21:46.132
- Amen.
- The devil is hiding,

22:54.580 --> 22:55.926
This is why
I'm a lapsed Catholic.

22:57.445 --> 22:59.170
So obviously
they're laundering money.

22:59.308 --> 23:00.689
Where from?
- Don't know.

23:00.827 --> 23:04.003
His teeth are whiter
than a Wilco concert.

23:04.141 --> 23:05.625
You loved that concert.

With money in your pocket.

23:07.593 --> 23:09.560
OK.

23:09.698 --> 23:12.045
What's the play?

23:12.183 --> 23:14.979
The space between his public
persona and private life.

23:15.117 --> 23:16.498
<i>Every Wednesday,

23:25.438 --> 23:26.405
we got the keys to the kingdom.

23:34.343 --> 23:35.966

You saved her.

Oh, my gosh.

23:49.186 --> 23:50.877
Thank you.

23:51.015 --> 23:52.500
Why, thank--oh!

23:52.638 --> 23:54.881
Are you that pastor from TV?

24:05.823 --> 24:07.687
- Are you OK?
- Easy, Karen.

24:07.825 --> 24:09.206
Not everything's
a viral moment.

24:09.344 --> 24:11.139
Who asked you?
Mind your own business.

24:11.277 --> 24:12.589
Oh, that's the pot
calling the kettle black.

24:12.727 --> 24:13.900
- Pastor.
- That's racist.

24:14.038 --> 24:15.384
That's not racist!

24:15.523 --> 24:17.352
You're a proper hero
is what you are.

24:17.490 --> 24:18.733
- I have rights.
- Peace be with you.

24:18.871 --> 24:19.872
I can film
anything I want to.

24:20.010 --> 24:21.529
Did someone drop a phone?

24:21.667 --> 24:22.771
Oh.

24:22.909 --> 24:24.532
That's--

24:25.912 --> 24:27.120
Bless you.

24:27.258 --> 24:29.053
Thank you.

24:29.191 --> 24:30.745
Find anything?

24:30.883 --> 24:32.229
I did.

24:32.367 --> 24:34.438
Whoever the pastor
is laundering money for,

24:34.576 --> 24:36.785
he's meeting tonight
at some D.C. gala.

24:36.923 --> 24:38.649
If these guys are taking
the risk to meet in person,

24:38.787 --> 24:41.376
they're either celebrating,
or they're scared.

24:41.514 --> 24:43.067
Either way, we can use that.

24:43.205 --> 24:46.105
Hey, you, like, cranked
my wrist on that purse snatch.

24:58.704 --> 25:00.464
Ferraris don't wait in line.

25:04.917 --> 25:06.263
Invitation?

25:35.395 --> 25:37.639
So the dirty cash goes in.

25:37.777 --> 25:39.986
The church cleans it.

25:40.124 --> 25:42.023
Then the pastor takes his cut
and donates the rest

25:42.161 --> 25:44.163
around town
to buy access and influence

25:44.301 --> 25:46.441
for whoever it is
he's taking orders from.

25:46.579 --> 25:48.132
One big D.C. shell game.

25:48.270 --> 25:49.686
And they think
we're the crooks.

25:49.824 --> 25:50.825
Huh.

25:50.963 --> 25:52.067
Hi.

25:52.205 --> 25:53.724
So even you
can understand it.

25:53.862 --> 25:55.001
I gave him the invitation.

25:55.139 --> 25:56.796
He took my car.
- All right.

25:56.934 --> 25:58.142
I'm on the pastor.
You find his contact.

25:58.280 --> 25:59.454
Mm-hmm.

26:33.212 --> 26:34.662
And it also helps
that he's my father.

26:37.423 --> 26:39.770
So, Emma, your father's
the former governor.

26:39.908 --> 26:41.082
Your brother's a senator.

26:41.220 --> 26:42.255
What does that make you?

26:42.393 --> 26:44.223
A crushing disappointment.

26:44.361 --> 26:46.018
Oh!

26:48.434 --> 26:50.194
No, I'm actually
a data analyst

26:50.332 --> 26:52.541
for a logistics firm.

26:52.680 --> 26:54.198
Oh, that's great.

27:00.377 --> 27:01.758
A negroni.

27:01.896 --> 27:03.242
Really?

27:08.523 --> 27:10.352
How is it?

27:11.768 --> 27:12.769
- Imperfect.
- Mm.

27:12.907 --> 27:14.184
No fire trick.

27:19.741 --> 27:21.398
You're here.

27:21.536 --> 27:23.089
I'm here.

27:26.368 --> 27:28.301
Let me guess.

27:28.439 --> 27:30.614
They needed a theremin player
for the band.

27:30.752 --> 27:32.478
No.

27:34.756 --> 27:36.965
Actually wanted some face time
with my congressman.

27:37.103 --> 27:39.209
This pothole can't seem
to get fixed.

27:42.005 --> 27:46.250
It's strange, seeing you
in something other than a robe.

27:46.388 --> 27:48.114
Was that a compliment?

27:49.737 --> 27:50.565
I can do better.

28:03.060 --> 28:04.924
You are an old sandbagger,

28:05.062 --> 28:07.651
because I know
what you're up--

28:07.789 --> 28:09.170
We'll see you inside.

28:11.517 --> 28:12.691
May I pray with you, Pastor?

28:12.829 --> 28:14.416
Of course.

28:50.694 --> 28:51.626
<i>Break time.</i>

28:56.113 --> 28:57.977
What do you mean?

28:58.115 --> 28:59.013
What do you think I mean?

29:03.845 --> 29:06.883
So your family's...
impressive.

29:07.021 --> 29:09.402
Mm, only from the outside
looking in.

29:09.540 --> 29:13.027
Spin over substance,
all day, every day.

29:13.165 --> 29:15.581
Mm.

29:15.719 --> 29:20.068
I own a bar...
with my family in Baltimore.

29:20.206 --> 29:24.728
Who I am is so wrapped up
in who they are that it's...

29:24.866 --> 29:27.696
hard to see past it
sometimes, you know?

29:27.835 --> 29:30.907
I have the opposite problem.

29:31.045 --> 29:35.049
Been defining myself
against them my entire life.

29:35.187 --> 29:36.326
Sounds lonely.

29:37.914 --> 29:39.501
It can be.

29:53.067 --> 29:54.862
Sorry.
I got to--

29:55.000 --> 29:56.898
- Yeah.
- Be right back.

29:57.036 --> 29:58.037
Mm-hmm.

29:58.175 --> 29:59.798
Yeah.

30:01.730 --> 30:03.387
Hey.

30:03.525 --> 30:04.733
What in the hell are you doing?

30:04.872 --> 30:07.012
- Just blending in.
- Please.

30:07.150 --> 30:09.221
I am the one person who always
knows when you're lying.

30:11.188 --> 30:13.087
What's going on
with the pastor?

30:13.225 --> 30:15.675
Well, I identified
his contact, and you're right.

30:15.814 --> 30:17.574
He's nervous, which means
that something's up,

30:17.712 --> 30:21.233
which you would know if you
weren't otherwise distracted.

30:21.371 --> 30:23.131
Charlie, this was your plan.

30:23.269 --> 30:24.201
You brought me on board.

30:24.339 --> 30:25.651
I am here.

30:25.789 --> 30:27.998
Where are you?

30:28.136 --> 30:29.828
Don't do this to me again.

30:38.146 --> 30:41.149
Hey, sorry about that.

30:41.287 --> 30:42.771
I have to go.

30:42.910 --> 30:44.670
Work thing.

30:44.808 --> 30:47.535
But tomorrow night,

30:47.673 --> 30:50.124
French-fusion place on Concord,

30:50.262 --> 30:54.956
a harpist playing
a song neither of us knows.

30:55.094 --> 30:56.509
Sounds wonderful.

30:56.647 --> 30:59.133
But...

30:59.271 --> 31:00.928
I have a thing.

31:01.066 --> 31:03.654
You have a thing?

31:07.106 --> 31:09.039
What's going on?
Did something happen?

31:11.904 --> 31:13.906
It's like you said, Emma.

31:14.044 --> 31:16.633
There's a big difference
between fantasy and reality.

31:19.153 --> 31:22.673
Can you honestly say
you didn't think about me,

31:22.811 --> 31:24.641
that you don't think
there's something here?

31:27.471 --> 31:29.991
I didn't.

31:30.129 --> 31:31.337
And I don't.

32:17.866 --> 32:18.867
Stop.

32:23.148 --> 32:24.563
Did anyone follow you?

32:26.392 --> 32:27.773
No.

32:27.911 --> 32:28.947
Leave the suitcase.

32:29.085 --> 32:31.225
We'll take it from here.

32:31.363 --> 32:33.917
Our friend will be in touch
when he knows more.

32:36.161 --> 32:37.231
Get going.

32:37.369 --> 32:38.577
Thank you.

32:43.892 --> 32:46.136
Don't let Tina
near that suitcase.

32:46.274 --> 32:47.517
Hey, you know what?

32:47.655 --> 32:49.484
Too soon.

32:51.486 --> 32:52.625
Wow.

32:52.763 --> 32:54.213
Look at you.
- I was at a thing.

32:54.351 --> 32:55.559
Talk to me.

32:55.697 --> 32:57.734
That signal
in the noise you found?

32:57.872 --> 32:59.805
The deputy director ran it
past our friends at the FBI,

32:59.943 --> 33:00.944
and guess what.

33:01.082 --> 33:02.911
We got a hit?

33:03.050 --> 33:04.465
Patrick Maguire.

33:04.603 --> 33:06.812
This dude's basically
the Jeff Bezos of fentanyl.

33:06.950 --> 33:08.400
His operations
have doubled in size

33:08.538 --> 33:09.953
in the last three years.

33:10.091 --> 33:11.679
Been on the FBI's radar
for a while,

33:11.817 --> 33:13.474
but they couldn't nail him.

33:13.612 --> 33:15.683
So we traced the movements
of his crew,

33:15.821 --> 33:19.618
hacked into a nearby
security camera, and got this.

33:22.103 --> 33:23.484
Who's that?

33:23.622 --> 33:25.141
No clue.

33:25.279 --> 33:27.833
But he stiffed the syndicate
on a deal, so...

33:27.971 --> 33:29.248
Maguire's still here
trying to secure

33:29.386 --> 33:30.974
an East Coast
distribution hub.

33:31.112 --> 33:33.149
Call our friends at the FBI.

33:33.287 --> 33:34.943
I want to be there
when this guy goes down.

33:35.082 --> 33:36.531
Done and done.

33:38.602 --> 33:40.190
<i>♪ You got it ♪</i>

33:40.328 --> 33:41.709
You guys should have seen
the look on the pastor's face.

33:41.847 --> 33:43.435
I thought he was gonna
crap his holy trousers.

33:43.573 --> 33:44.677
Beautiful work, guys.

33:45.989 --> 33:48.198
Just beautiful work.

33:48.336 --> 33:50.028
Except for the part
where Charlie almost blew

33:50.166 --> 33:52.168
the whole operation
on account of some girl.

33:52.306 --> 33:53.997
<i>♪ I said ow ♪</i>

33:54.135 --> 33:56.103
<i>♪ Ow, ow ♪</i>

33:56.241 --> 33:57.483
We'll have to be smart
about this,

33:57.621 --> 33:59.692
launder a little at a time
through the bar.

33:59.830 --> 34:02.143
At least you and Dad can
still start your retirement.

34:02.281 --> 34:03.800
Yeah, for what it's worth,
I vote Mexico.

34:03.938 --> 34:05.664
Spain's too far away.

34:05.802 --> 34:08.149
So... there's a new girl,
Charlie?

34:08.287 --> 34:10.496
Was, not is.

34:10.634 --> 34:12.326
Why was?

34:12.464 --> 34:14.638
'Cause, Mom, like, this
is what I'm good at, all right?

34:14.776 --> 34:15.950
Just this.

34:16.088 --> 34:18.056
<i>♪ Do the Everything ♪</i>

34:24.821 --> 34:26.029
We're not OK with this.

34:26.167 --> 34:27.548
With what?

34:27.686 --> 34:29.584
With your mother and I
sailing off into the sunset

34:29.722 --> 34:32.587
while you stay here to fall
on your sword for this family.

34:32.725 --> 34:34.141
You did that once.

34:34.279 --> 34:36.522
- Dad, it's fine.
- Just stop!

34:40.630 --> 34:42.080
It's our fault
that you went inside,

34:42.218 --> 34:43.702
had to survive that hell.

34:46.187 --> 34:47.671
We're in this spot today
because of our choices,

34:47.809 --> 34:48.914
not yours.

34:49.052 --> 34:50.674
And you're right, Charlie.

34:50.812 --> 34:52.987
You are the best.

34:53.125 --> 34:54.506
The best.

34:54.644 --> 34:57.992
But this can't be
your whole world.

34:58.130 --> 35:01.237
I got a lifetime
of regrets,

35:01.375 --> 35:03.756
and soon I may not
remember any of them.

35:07.795 --> 35:10.522
So no, Charlie, no.

35:10.660 --> 35:11.695
No, we're not walking away

35:11.833 --> 35:13.904
and leaving you
holding the bag.

35:14.042 --> 35:15.906
Either we're all out,
or we're all in.

35:21.567 --> 35:23.638
Mr. Maguire,
we're all set and ready to go.

35:23.776 --> 35:25.537
All right.

35:25.675 --> 35:27.539
I told you
that deal was rotten.

35:27.677 --> 35:28.574
Should have listened to me.

35:30.507 --> 35:32.199
Stop thinking
you're smarter than me.

35:33.924 --> 35:35.409
It won't end well.

35:39.758 --> 35:41.208
I'll be right behind you.

35:55.636 --> 35:57.500
We got movement.

35:57.638 --> 35:59.605
On my count.
- Hold up.

35:59.743 --> 36:01.642
We need to wait until
his whole crew is on the plane.

36:01.780 --> 36:03.402
You did your job.

36:03.540 --> 36:05.266
Now let us do ours.

36:18.624 --> 36:19.763
Drop the bag!

36:19.901 --> 36:22.249
Drop the bag!

36:22.387 --> 36:24.285
Get on the ground!
Get on the ground!

36:57.801 --> 36:59.941
Damn it.

37:05.119 --> 37:06.120
<i>You good?</i>

37:06.258 --> 37:07.501
<i>How's your wrist?</i>

37:07.639 --> 37:10.158
<i>It's fine.
I'm fine.</i>

37:10.297 --> 37:12.160
Did you get an ID
on our mystery woman?

37:12.299 --> 37:15.405
<i>Yes.
Daphne Finch.</i>

37:15.543 --> 37:17.580
Grew up in Philadelphia
to a single mother,

37:17.718 --> 37:20.168
law degree at Penn,
MBA at Columbia.

37:20.307 --> 37:21.515
Maguire brought her in
a couple years ago

37:21.653 --> 37:23.724
as a kind of consultant.

37:23.862 --> 37:26.174
<i>The crime syndicate's
consultant?</i>

37:26.313 --> 37:27.693
Weird, right?

37:27.831 --> 37:30.524
<i>Nothing about this girl
screams Irish gangster.</i>

37:30.662 --> 37:32.905
It's her.

37:33.043 --> 37:36.081
She's the reason their
operation expanded so quickly.

37:36.219 --> 37:38.601
She's the brains
behind Maguire's syndicate,

37:38.739 --> 37:41.431
which means arresting Maguire
changes nothing.

37:41.569 --> 37:43.744
<i>Pull all available data:</i>

37:43.882 --> 37:46.712
<i>phone records, emails, texts,
and every known associate.</i>

37:49.197 --> 37:50.854
<i>So we won the battle?</i>

37:50.992 --> 37:52.408
Yeah...

37:52.546 --> 37:54.202
but not the war.

38:02.418 --> 38:04.040
I got to call you back.

38:21.126 --> 38:22.127
What happened?
Are you--

38:22.265 --> 38:23.853
I'm fine.

38:23.991 --> 38:24.992
What are you doing here?

38:26.925 --> 38:29.030
Look, about last night,
I want to explain.

38:29.168 --> 38:30.584
It's really not necessary.

38:30.722 --> 38:31.757
No, it is. Look.

38:33.345 --> 38:35.140
My life,

38:35.278 --> 38:37.038
my family, it's--

38:39.040 --> 38:41.353
It's complicated.

38:41.491 --> 38:44.563
The more you know about me,
the faster you'll want to run.

38:44.701 --> 38:46.013
I get it.

38:46.151 --> 38:48.636
We spent 36 hours
in a hotel room.

38:48.774 --> 38:50.776
We barely know each other.
Let's just leave it at that.

38:50.914 --> 38:52.260
You're wrong.
I do know you.

38:55.229 --> 38:57.162
<i>Coffee, black.</i>

38:57.300 --> 39:00.338
<i>Stones over the Beatles,
all day, every day.</i>

39:00.476 --> 39:04.169
<i>You read people better
than they read themselves.</i>

39:04.307 --> 39:07.275
<i>You're loyal,</i>

39:07.414 --> 39:09.001
<i>but you don't trust easily</i>

39:09.139 --> 39:10.934
<i>or often.</i>

39:12.591 --> 39:14.835
<i>And you're funny,
even though you use it</i>

39:14.973 --> 39:16.526
<i>to protect yourself.</i>

39:18.494 --> 39:21.255
<i>I know you want
something different.</i>

39:21.393 --> 39:23.153
<i>So do I.</i>

39:23.291 --> 39:26.467
I want to take you
on that date.

39:26.605 --> 39:28.366
What do you say?

39:28.504 --> 39:30.540
I say you're right.

39:30.678 --> 39:33.371
I don't trust easily or often,
but last night--

39:33.509 --> 39:37.029
Last night,
I lied

39:37.167 --> 39:39.169
when I said that...

39:39.307 --> 39:42.138
there wasn't something
between us,

39:42.276 --> 39:45.624
when I said
I didn't think about you.

39:45.762 --> 39:49.559
Truth is, I never stopped
thinking about you,

39:49.697 --> 39:52.769
not once, not for a minute.

39:52.907 --> 39:55.945
I--

39:56.083 --> 39:57.395
Emma.

40:14.066 --> 40:17.035
Maybe we just stay here,

40:17.173 --> 40:18.864
do this.

40:20.556 --> 40:21.867
For how long?

40:24.007 --> 40:26.562
Indefinitely.

40:26.700 --> 40:28.011
Yeah.

40:40.023 --> 40:41.784
Hey, Bird.

40:43.475 --> 40:45.373
Forget everything I said
last night, OK?

40:45.512 --> 40:47.030
We're not gonna
chip away at the debt.

40:47.168 --> 40:48.584
That's not how this
is gonna work.

40:48.722 --> 40:50.965
One last big score
gets us all out for good.

40:51.103 --> 40:53.312
Yeah, I've heard that before.

40:53.451 --> 40:54.452
Hey, it's different
this time.

40:55.522 --> 40:56.419
OK.

40:58.214 --> 41:00.285
Charlie.

41:05.773 --> 41:07.050
Oh, great.

41:07.188 --> 41:08.327
Looks like we got
the whole family here.

41:08.466 --> 41:09.363
- Ollie?
- Wait, no, hold on, Bird.

41:09.501 --> 41:12.297
Wait. Just wait.

41:16.888 --> 41:18.130
You won.

41:20.029 --> 41:21.789
Smart kid.

41:21.927 --> 41:22.928
Wonder where she gets it.

41:26.691 --> 41:28.762
This is a nice place, Charlie.

41:30.142 --> 41:31.109
Look, about your money--

41:31.247 --> 41:33.594
It's gone.
I heard.

41:33.732 --> 41:35.596
Love can be a real bitch, huh?

41:37.633 --> 41:39.738
You owe us
the 10 million you stole

41:39.876 --> 41:41.119
plus an additional 5.

41:41.257 --> 41:42.569
Let's call it the cost

41:42.707 --> 41:44.260
of getting Mr. Maguire
out of prison.

41:44.398 --> 41:46.365
Why?

41:46.504 --> 41:47.608
I mean, it looks like
you got what you wanted.

41:47.746 --> 41:48.920
You're in charge.

41:49.058 --> 41:49.783
I'm glad I could
help you out with that.

41:49.921 --> 41:51.819
Careful, Charlie.

41:51.957 --> 41:54.339
There is no angle out of this

41:54.477 --> 41:57.963
except for you doing
exactly what I tell you to.

42:05.074 --> 42:08.008
OK.

42:08.146 --> 42:10.182
So what guarantee do I have
that you're not just gonna

42:10.320 --> 42:13.358
take your money, then...
take care of us?

42:13.496 --> 42:15.222
That's the problem
with lying for a living.

42:15.360 --> 42:18.121
You never really know
who you can trust, do you?

42:23.886 --> 42:26.474
Look, that kind of money,
it's gonna take me some time.

42:26.613 --> 42:28.062
Which I don't have.

42:28.200 --> 42:32.239
So I suggest you do
what you do best.

42:33.516 --> 42:35.553
Get to stealing, Charlie,

42:35.691 --> 42:37.175
because you are not
gonna be able

42:37.313 --> 42:39.315
to lie your way
out of this one.
