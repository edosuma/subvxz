00:02.436 --> 00:05.437
What can I tell you, Cathy?
My parents aren't home yet.

00:05.439 --> 00:08.140
Oh, don't worry.
I'm going to get the car.

00:08.142 --> 00:10.409
They already said
I could use it.

00:10.411 --> 00:13.212
No, I promise we won't
miss the concert.

00:13.214 --> 00:14.546
Bye.

00:14.548 --> 00:18.717
- If we miss that concert..
- Unbelievable.

00:18.719 --> 00:20.586
I know they're an hour late.

00:20.588 --> 00:23.622
No, I'm talkin' about
Wall Street weekend review.

00:23.624 --> 00:26.392
This guy is sitting there
with a straight face

00:26.394 --> 00:30.262
talkin' about gold
like it's valuable or something.

00:30.264 --> 00:31.730
But gold is valuable.

00:31.732 --> 00:34.600
- And so is time.
- You're kidding.

00:34.602 --> 00:39.338
You may not believe this but
on Melmac gold is worthless.

00:39.340 --> 00:42.708
On Melmac the most valuable
thing is foam.

00:42.710 --> 00:45.077
- Foam?
- Yeah.

00:45.079 --> 00:47.079
My Granduncle Shumway
once said

00:47.081 --> 00:51.350
"I'm heading out west, there's
foam in them thar hills."

00:51.352 --> 00:54.086
Well, foam is almost
worthless here.

00:54.088 --> 00:57.489
- What about gravel?
- Gravel's cheap too.

00:57.491 --> 00:59.058
Ah..

00:59.060 --> 01:01.093
- Wax?
- Yup.

01:01.095 --> 01:02.594
Boy.

01:02.596 --> 01:05.064
ALF, I got some more
lint for you to save.

01:07.635 --> 01:08.801
Dump it.

01:09.804 --> 01:12.771

02:13.834 --> 02:15.434
Cathy, I told you
I'd call you

02:15.436 --> 02:17.436
the minute
they got home.

02:17.438 --> 02:19.338
Fine, if it'll
make you feel better

02:19.340 --> 02:22.608
go stand by the curb. Bye!

02:22.610 --> 02:25.677
Hey, even silver has value.

02:28.249 --> 02:29.748
That's them.
See you later, ALF.

02:32.186 --> 02:33.685
Oh, no.
It's a tow truck.

02:33.687 --> 02:38.490
- I didn't order any toes.
- The car broke down again.

02:38.492 --> 02:40.859
So what's the connection
to toes?

02:43.230 --> 02:44.696
Mom and dad
what happened to the car?

02:44.698 --> 02:47.232
- The engine.
- And the differential.

02:47.234 --> 02:48.500
And the brakes.

02:48.502 --> 02:50.335
Hey, ALF, you better
go in the kitchen.

02:50.337 --> 02:51.503
The tow truck driver
is coming in.

02:51.505 --> 02:53.472
He's helping us
bring in the groceries.

02:53.474 --> 02:55.374
Then who's bringing in the toes?

02:56.810 --> 02:58.510
Just go.

03:01.382 --> 03:02.881
Well, there go
my concert plans.

03:02.883 --> 03:05.918
I-I'm sorry, Lynn. We're as
upset about this as you are.

03:05.920 --> 03:08.320
It just seems like my friends
are always drivin' me some place

03:08.322 --> 03:11.356
and then when it's my turn to
drive something always happens.

03:11.358 --> 03:13.325
I'd like to be more sympathetic

03:13.327 --> 03:17.196
but ice cream
is melting on my shoe.

03:17.198 --> 03:19.965
I'm sorry.
I'll call Cathy and cancel.

03:23.804 --> 03:26.238
Sorry about my tow truck
breakin' down.

03:26.240 --> 03:28.473
What do you suppose
the odds were on that one?

03:28.475 --> 03:30.309
Ah, you can just set
those down anywhere.

03:30.311 --> 03:31.777
Ah, that's okay, I'll carry
them right into the kitchen.

03:31.779 --> 03:36.014
Uh, no, uh...we'd like
to unload our own groceries

03:36.016 --> 03:38.650
it's kind of a family thing.

03:38.652 --> 03:41.520
I know what you mean,
we're the same way.

03:41.522 --> 03:44.022
Well, how, how much do I
owe you then, Bert?

03:44.024 --> 03:45.857
Well, uh, the tow is 49

03:45.859 --> 03:49.828
but, uh, then I owe
you 63.50 for the new battery.

03:49.830 --> 03:51.597
Of course, your wife
sat on my glasses.

03:51.599 --> 03:54.433
So, uh, let's see, uh..

03:57.238 --> 03:58.837
...carry the four..

04:00.741 --> 04:04.476
- Call it 50 bucks.
- But who owes who?

04:05.813 --> 04:08.847
That's a good one.
Cash will be fine.

04:08.849 --> 04:10.716
Here you go.

04:10.718 --> 04:13.652
You know, I hate takin'
this money from you.

04:13.654 --> 04:15.287
You folks are gonna
have to shell out plenty

04:15.289 --> 04:16.622
to get that car fixed.

04:16.624 --> 04:18.257
How much do you
think it'll be?

04:18.259 --> 04:22.261
Well, you're lookin' at couple
of grand to repair the engine

04:22.263 --> 04:24.663
and another douche
for the differential

04:24.665 --> 04:27.966
plus your tires are shot.
That's, that's gonna run you

04:27.968 --> 04:32.571
uh...carry the four..

04:32.573 --> 04:34.539
I think we get the picture.

04:34.541 --> 04:35.974
Yeah, and also you
may wanna consider

04:35.976 --> 04:37.809
a new set of brake pads.

04:37.811 --> 04:41.847
We should've never towed you
with the emergency on.

04:41.849 --> 04:45.951
- My mistake.
- You're too kind.

04:45.953 --> 04:47.919
I'm sorry, I got a grease spot
on the carpet.

04:47.921 --> 04:52.324
Oh, no, no, no. I-I-I I'm sure
that this will take care of it.

04:52.326 --> 04:55.494
- I-it I-I-I.. It's my fault.
- Don't worry about it.

04:55.496 --> 04:57.663
Thanks, thanks again.
See you, Bert.

04:58.699 --> 05:01.033
You can come out now, ALF.

05:01.035 --> 05:03.869
Well, I've canceled
my concert plans.

05:03.871 --> 05:07.105
But before I go into my room and
listen to The Pretenders on tape

05:07.107 --> 05:09.875
instead of seeing them in
person, I would just like to say

05:09.877 --> 05:13.045
that I wish we had a second car.
Have a nice evening.

05:16.483 --> 05:18.383
Why don't you
buy her one, Willie?

05:18.385 --> 05:20.952
- What?
- A car.

05:20.954 --> 05:22.521
Spring for it.

05:22.523 --> 05:25.424
We can't afford to
spring for a car.

05:25.426 --> 05:26.825
Now is the time.

05:26.827 --> 05:29.761
Four point eight financing
on every Chevy in stock.

05:29.763 --> 05:32.631
On approval of credit,
of course.

05:32.633 --> 05:34.132
I believe our credit
was used up

05:34.134 --> 05:36.368
in the repair
to the roof of our garage.

05:36.370 --> 05:40.138
Which had been damaged I believe
by an errant spaceship.

05:40.140 --> 05:42.841
Thanks for not naming names.

05:42.843 --> 05:45.610
Willie, what if we kicked
in a little money to add

05:45.612 --> 05:49.381
to what Lynn has saved
and let her buy a used car.

05:49.383 --> 05:51.383
Well, I don't know, we, we..

05:51.385 --> 05:52.918
We'd have to talk about it,
that's all.

05:52.920 --> 05:56.488
You've ice cream
on your shoes.

05:56.490 --> 05:59.925
- Who has my Pretenders tape?
- Oh, it's in my Walkman.

05:59.927 --> 06:02.661
I use it to do my aerobics.

06:02.663 --> 06:05.530
Lynn, how much money do you have
in your savings account?

06:05.532 --> 06:07.966
About $150.

06:07.968 --> 06:10.068
What if we kicked in
150 with that?

06:10.070 --> 06:13.839
- What kinda car would that buy?
- A stolen one.

06:13.841 --> 06:16.742
You guys would go in halves
with me on a car?

06:16.744 --> 06:17.909
We could do that.

06:17.911 --> 06:19.544
As-as long we were sure
that it would

06:19.546 --> 06:21.079
amount enough to buy a safe one.

06:21.081 --> 06:23.749
Well, I-I can, I can get
a part time job to earn more.

06:23.751 --> 06:26.485
There's an opening in
Mr. Jim's Chicken and Oysters.

06:26.487 --> 06:28.553
We had a Mr. Jim's on Melmac.

06:28.555 --> 06:31.590
But instead of chicken
and oysters, it was dogs and--

06:31.592 --> 06:33.692
- Don't say it, ALF, don't.
- Why?

06:33.694 --> 06:35.761
It's not the same Mr. Jim.

06:35.763 --> 06:37.195
The one I knew is in prison.

06:37.197 --> 06:39.931
He got caught substituting
hamburger for collie.

06:42.669 --> 06:44.836
- He said it.
- Said what?

06:45.806 --> 06:47.572
Well, so, so what do
you think, dad?

06:47.574 --> 06:52.544
I think that's one of the most
repugnant things I can imagine.

06:52.546 --> 06:54.479
No, no.
I mean, can I get a job?

06:54.481 --> 06:57.883
Honey, do you think that you can
handle a job and go to school?

06:57.885 --> 06:59.985
I mean, you're not exactly
getting straight A's.

06:59.987 --> 07:02.687
All the more reason
to start a carrier.

07:02.689 --> 07:04.456
Nobody asked you.

07:04.458 --> 07:08.193
Well, if I had to wait for
an invitation, I'd never speak.

07:09.596 --> 07:11.797
I'll put away the groceries.

07:13.233 --> 07:17.002
How many more questions
are there in this stupid test?

07:17.004 --> 07:20.672
Five more on chicken
and three more on oysters.

07:20.674 --> 07:24.142
Oh, and there's a two part essay
on citizenship.

07:24.144 --> 07:26.178
I'm so tired.

07:26.180 --> 07:28.146
Is it really worth
all this trouble

07:28.148 --> 07:30.816
just to get a jalopy
to drive around in?

07:30.818 --> 07:34.886
Yes, ALF.
I want a car more than anythin'.

07:34.888 --> 07:36.588
Well, then you better
get crackin' here

07:36.590 --> 07:38.757
if you wanna be
wearin' Mr. Jim's

07:38.759 --> 07:41.693
feather and shell insignia.

07:41.695 --> 07:43.094
- Alright.
- Alright.

07:43.096 --> 07:47.165
- What's the next question?
- Question 126.

07:47.167 --> 07:50.836
"While preparing
the clock and shark combo

07:50.838 --> 07:54.506
"the chicken should be,
A, breaded?

07:54.508 --> 07:56.641
"B, baked?

07:56.643 --> 07:59.644
C, washed?"

07:59.646 --> 08:02.781
I'll go with...C.
Washed.

08:02.783 --> 08:05.684
Eh-h-h! Wrong.

08:05.686 --> 08:07.786
The answer is A, breaded.

08:07.788 --> 08:09.221
You're not supposed to wash 'em?

08:09.223 --> 08:13.658
According to Mr. Jim,
chickens wash themselves.

08:13.660 --> 08:17.229
Don't wash chickens.
Don't wash chickens.

08:17.231 --> 08:18.663
- Okay.
- Alright.

08:18.665 --> 08:20.999
Question 127.

08:21.001 --> 08:26.071
"An oyster should be thrown out
when A, it turns brown

08:26.073 --> 08:30.976
B, it turns black,
C, it turns over."

08:34.081 --> 08:36.915
That's right.
Take your time.

08:36.917 --> 08:39.117
Think before you answer.

08:41.822 --> 08:44.789
Lynn, Lynn.

08:44.791 --> 08:47.526
Yo, Lynn.

08:47.528 --> 08:49.628
I'm gonna guess brown.

08:49.630 --> 08:50.762
Lynn, I thought you might have--

08:50.764 --> 08:52.864
Ssshh! She's asleep.

08:52.866 --> 08:55.800
Oh, the poor thing.

08:55.802 --> 08:57.168
You're killing her, Kate.

08:57.170 --> 09:00.005
She can't work and go to school
at the same time.

09:00.007 --> 09:01.873
You are robbing her
of her youth

09:01.875 --> 09:04.009
just because you won't
spring for a car.

09:04.845 --> 09:06.211
[sniffing]

09:06.213 --> 09:07.579
Is that cocoa?

09:07.581 --> 09:09.848
I can't believe
you're saying that to me.

09:09.850 --> 09:12.684
Why not?
It smells like cocoa.

09:12.686 --> 09:15.120
Alright, it's cocoa. Let's get
back to this car thing.

09:15.122 --> 09:17.589
Now we made a deal with Lynn.

09:17.591 --> 09:20.191
We'll contribute half,
she's to earn the other half.

09:20.193 --> 09:22.761
But it is cocoa?

09:22.763 --> 09:24.262
Yes, it is.

09:24.264 --> 09:26.698
I knew it.

09:26.700 --> 09:27.933
Do you want the cocoa, ALF?

09:27.935 --> 09:30.268
- Are there marshmallows in it?
- No.

09:30.270 --> 09:31.570
- Pass.
- Fine.

09:33.774 --> 09:36.207
But some hot coffee
would be nice.

09:39.012 --> 09:40.912
I guess she didn't hear me.

09:51.024 --> 09:53.925
Here you are, sir.
The pelican gullet platter.

09:53.927 --> 09:56.027
Chicken on the half shell
for the lady.

09:56.029 --> 09:58.964
And oyster dog and a Mr. Jim's
game card for you.

09:58.966 --> 10:00.632
What do I do?

10:00.634 --> 10:04.169
You scratch off three oysters
and win a pack of cigarettes.

10:04.171 --> 10:07.405
Ah, which is the chicken
and which is the oyster, Lynn?

10:07.407 --> 10:11.109
- This tastes like fish.
- Then that's the chicken.

10:11.111 --> 10:15.046
You did everything right, Lynn.
It looks fine.

10:15.048 --> 10:16.715
You served it beautifully.

10:16.717 --> 10:20.885
I just don't think I'm really
all that hungry right now.

10:20.887 --> 10:22.721
You don't have
to be nice, dad.

10:22.723 --> 10:25.223
That was the worst thing
I ever ate.

10:26.059 --> 10:27.959
I just serve it, buster.

10:29.696 --> 10:31.329
We're supposed to say that.

10:31.331 --> 10:35.000
- I'm gonna go change.
- I won, I won.

10:35.002 --> 10:40.271
- Menthol lights.
- I'll take that.

10:40.273 --> 10:43.008
You know, Willie,
Lynn hasn't said anything to me

10:43.010 --> 10:46.378
but she's been so good
about this whole thing.

10:46.380 --> 10:48.246
Maybe we should
let her buy a car now

10:48.248 --> 10:50.148
and she could pay us back
little by little.

10:50.150 --> 10:52.984
Gosh, Kate,
I thought we decided.

10:52.986 --> 10:56.087
I think it's important that
she sees this thing through.

10:56.089 --> 10:58.289
Umm, something smells good.

10:58.291 --> 11:01.359
- You can have mine.
- Later.

11:01.361 --> 11:04.663
- Where is Lynn?
- Um, she's changing. Why?

11:04.665 --> 11:06.297
You'll find out in a minute.

11:06.299 --> 11:08.066
- Lynn!
- 'Yeah.'

11:08.068 --> 11:11.269
Got somethin' for ya.
Meet me in the garage.

11:12.472 --> 11:14.172
Bye.

11:15.242 --> 11:16.875
What has he done?

11:16.877 --> 11:19.177
Maybe nothing.

11:19.179 --> 11:21.079
Maybe.

11:21.081 --> 11:23.114
What's going on? ALF?

11:23.116 --> 11:26.017
(ALF)
'Out here.
I've got a surprise for ya.'

11:26.019 --> 11:28.420
- What is it?
- 'I'll give you a hint.'

11:28.422 --> 11:31.022
[car honking]

11:38.131 --> 11:41.466
- It's a car!
- Hmm, you didn't need a hint.

11:47.407 --> 11:51.042
- ALF stole a car.
- I didn't steal it.

11:51.044 --> 11:53.445
I bought it...for Lynn.

11:56.416 --> 11:58.349
I don't believe it.

11:58.351 --> 12:01.486
It would've been here last week.
But I held out for red.

12:02.856 --> 12:04.189
I don't believe it.

12:04.191 --> 12:07.125
It's true,
everybody wants red.

12:07.127 --> 12:09.360
ALF, how did you
buy this car?

12:09.362 --> 12:11.162
I got it
through my broker.

12:11.164 --> 12:12.831
Broker?
What broker?

12:12.833 --> 12:16.434
The one I hired to sell
the gold from my spaceship.

12:16.436 --> 12:19.904
Wait, wait, wait. Let's just
take this one step at a time.

12:19.906 --> 12:22.240
You bought a car?

12:22.242 --> 12:24.943
Yes. The papers are
in that envelope.

12:26.113 --> 12:27.879
You have gold?

12:27.881 --> 12:29.447
Had gold.

12:29.449 --> 12:32.484
All the plumbing
on my ship was gold.

12:32.486 --> 12:33.952
Except for the bidet.

12:34.554 --> 12:36.121
That was platinum.

12:36.857 --> 12:38.423
Uh-huh.

12:38.425 --> 12:41.926
ALF, this is the most
wonderful present

12:41.928 --> 12:44.095
anyone has ever given me.

12:44.097 --> 12:45.930
Aww, you're just saying that.

12:45.932 --> 12:46.931
No!

12:46.933 --> 12:49.934
No, I mean it.
It's incredible.

12:49.936 --> 12:53.138
Shektor, Kosay, and Klein,
investment brokers

12:53.140 --> 12:55.073
"Dear, ALF. Congratulations

12:55.075 --> 12:58.843
"or should I say
<i> congratulazzione.</i>

12:58.845 --> 13:01.346
"I've sold the balance of
your gold and will invest

13:01.348 --> 13:04.082
"the proceeds in
that mango farm in Oxnard.

13:04.084 --> 13:06.451
All the best. Joel."

13:06.453 --> 13:08.286
Look at this interior?

13:08.288 --> 13:10.789
The dashboard
is burled mahogany.

13:10.791 --> 13:14.259
Grown in the Ferrari family's
private arboretum.

13:15.162 --> 13:17.462
And check out these wheels.

13:17.464 --> 13:19.130
Chrome...from Rome.

13:19.132 --> 13:22.100
Ohh, feel this leather.

13:22.102 --> 13:25.370
Virgin ox.
Albino virgin.

13:25.372 --> 13:28.373
Oh, my gosh, Willie,
look, a cellular phone.

13:28.375 --> 13:30.842
Programmed for speed dialing.

13:30.844 --> 13:34.312
Come on, Willie. Park your
carcass on that virgin ox.

13:34.314 --> 13:36.080
- Yeah, come on, dad.
- Come on, hon.

13:36.082 --> 13:37.882
- Eh..
- Yeah, dad, park it.

13:37.884 --> 13:40.018
Yeah.

13:40.020 --> 13:42.420
Uh, no, no.
I'm not..

13:47.394 --> 13:49.160
I'm not getting in that car.

13:49.162 --> 13:51.296
I can't. ALF.

13:51.298 --> 13:52.864
We're not keeping the car.

13:52.866 --> 13:53.998
What?

13:54.000 --> 13:55.033
Why not, dad?

13:55.035 --> 13:56.401
Yeah, Willie, how come?

13:56.403 --> 14:00.872
- Because it's wrong.
- "Because it's wrong."

14:00.874 --> 14:04.542
Why don't we just needlepoint
that into a sampler?

14:04.544 --> 14:08.213
Look, we're not keeping a car
that costs 60 thousand--

14:08.215 --> 14:10.148
- Ninety.
- Ninety thousand.

14:10.150 --> 14:13.117
[mumbling]
Ninety thousand dollars.

14:13.119 --> 14:14.519
What's bugging you, Willie?

14:14.521 --> 14:17.155
Is it that your daughter drives
a better car than you do?

14:17.157 --> 14:19.924
That has nothing to do with it.

14:19.926 --> 14:22.861
We are returning this car.
Call Joel.

14:22.863 --> 14:27.365
I can't. He's in Palm Springs
till Thursday.

14:27.367 --> 14:31.069
Dad, please. I'll let you drive
my car anytime you want.

14:31.071 --> 14:34.305
You wanna see how
the Gucci airbag works?

14:34.307 --> 14:37.008
It's obvious, you cannot
have a rational conversation

14:37.010 --> 14:38.443
in the presence of a Ferrari.

14:38.445 --> 14:40.578
Alright.
We'll go into the kitchen.

14:40.580 --> 14:43.514
No, we'll go into the kitchen.
You stay here.

14:44.551 --> 14:48.186
Come on, Lynn.
Don't touch that airbag.

14:48.188 --> 14:51.089
Fine.
I'll just preset the radio.

14:51.091 --> 14:53.625
[chuckling]
Joel.

14:59.432 --> 15:02.233
I know what you're thinking, I'm
the ogre, I'm the wet blanket.

15:02.235 --> 15:03.968
Willie, no one is thinking that.

15:03.970 --> 15:05.370
- I am.
- Me too.

15:05.372 --> 15:06.638
I see.

15:06.640 --> 15:09.574
Dad, you're not being fair,
the car was a gift.

15:09.576 --> 15:13.077
No, no, no. No.
A gift is a tie tack.

15:13.079 --> 15:15.480
A...pen and pencil set,
maybe a bowl.

15:16.583 --> 15:20.251
We have all of those.
We need a car.

15:20.253 --> 15:22.954
Look, I think we're losing sight
of what we agreed on here.

15:22.956 --> 15:26.190
That things are appreciated more
when they're earned.

15:26.192 --> 15:28.393
Not when they're
just handed to us.

15:28.395 --> 15:30.495
There's no way I could
appreciate this more.

15:30.497 --> 15:32.430
I'm sorry, Lynn. I'm sorry.

15:32.432 --> 15:36.034
I just don't think that
a 16-year-old girl should have

15:36.036 --> 15:38.369
a $90,000 Ferrari.

15:38.371 --> 15:41.272
Unless she's a...
professional tennis player.

15:41.274 --> 15:44.342
I'm not above
taking tennis lessons.

15:44.344 --> 15:46.277
I don't think that's
what your father meant.

15:46.279 --> 15:49.047
I'm afraid the car
is going back.

15:49.049 --> 15:52.283
This is insane. We're actually
gonna give back a free Ferrari.

15:52.285 --> 15:54.419
Yes we are,
first thing tomorrow.

15:54.421 --> 15:56.254
But Joel's in Palm Springs.

15:56.256 --> 15:58.323
I'll talk to Shektor.
I'll talk to Klein.

15:58.325 --> 16:00.291
It doesn't matter.
Lynn, I'm sorry.

16:00.293 --> 16:03.695
Uh, I'm sorry about this.
But this is the way I feel.

16:05.131 --> 16:06.597
And I think in time..

16:06.599 --> 16:08.666
...you'll come to
respect my decision.

16:10.136 --> 16:12.303
It-it may not be today..

16:14.007 --> 16:16.341
Obviously, it won't be today.

16:16.343 --> 16:17.608
It won't be tomorrow either.

16:18.645 --> 16:21.279
[engine revving]

16:21.281 --> 16:23.681
- Willie?
- No, no, no.

16:23.683 --> 16:25.984
This is not happening.

16:25.986 --> 16:27.685
[tires screeching]

16:30.991 --> 16:32.290
Oh, my God.

16:32.292 --> 16:35.026
ALF laid rubber.

16:35.028 --> 16:36.427
He's gone.

16:36.429 --> 16:38.296
There's an alien out there
on the road somewhere

16:38.298 --> 16:40.064
in a red Ferrari.

16:40.066 --> 16:41.366
Maybe no one will notice.

16:41.368 --> 16:44.168
What do we, dad?
We can't call the police.

16:44.170 --> 16:45.570
We can't call the auto club.

16:45.572 --> 16:47.438
We-we can't even call Joel.

16:47.440 --> 16:49.207
Well, he wouldn't have
gotten very far.

16:49.209 --> 16:51.442
Kate, that car goes
a 180 miles an hour.

16:51.444 --> 16:54.479
He could be in Mexico by now.
We've got no choice.

16:54.481 --> 16:56.080
We've got to call the police.

16:56.082 --> 16:58.282
[telephone ringing]

17:04.391 --> 17:05.757
- Hello?
- Alright, alright.

17:05.759 --> 17:07.558
I'm gonna go out,
I'm gonna go next door

17:07.560 --> 17:09.227
I'm gonna try to borrow
Trevor's car..

17:09.229 --> 17:12.130
- Dad, it's for you.
- Not now, not no..

17:12.132 --> 17:14.465
Just tell whoever it is
I'll-I'll call 'em back later.

17:14.467 --> 17:17.235
He's gonna have to
call you back later, ALF.

17:17.237 --> 17:19.237
ALF! ALF.

17:19.239 --> 17:20.605
Willie, my man.

17:20.607 --> 17:25.343
I gotta tell you
this thing flies like the wind.

17:25.345 --> 17:27.378
Where are you,
where, what happened?

17:27.380 --> 17:31.249
I don't know, all I did was
turn the engine on

17:31.251 --> 17:34.385
before I knew it,
I was on the freeway.

17:34.387 --> 17:35.453
What freeway?

17:35.455 --> 17:37.655
The one headed for Oxnard.

17:37.657 --> 17:42.760
Hey, while I'm there, I think
I'll check out that mango farm.

17:42.762 --> 17:44.529
Forget the mango farm.

17:44.531 --> 17:46.364
That's easy for you to say.

17:46.366 --> 17:49.300
You're not a limited partner.

17:49.302 --> 17:51.235
Nice move, buddy.

17:51.237 --> 17:52.537
Yeah, you're another one.

17:53.640 --> 17:55.206
Willie, where is he?

17:55.208 --> 17:56.741
He's on his way to Oxnard.

17:56.743 --> 17:58.109
Oxnard..

17:58.111 --> 17:59.444
ALF, ALF,
pull off the road.

17:59.446 --> 18:00.611
Pull the car off the road.

18:00.613 --> 18:03.548
I can't, I'm in the fast lane.

18:03.550 --> 18:05.183
Although, you'd never
know it by the way

18:05.185 --> 18:06.717
these clowns are driving.

18:06.719 --> 18:08.352
[car horn honking]
Come on, lady!

18:08.354 --> 18:10.388
This ain't a parade.

18:10.390 --> 18:14.092
ALF, don't yell at the other
drivers, they'll see you.

18:14.094 --> 18:17.261
No way, I'm driving too fast.

18:17.263 --> 18:19.397
Hey!
Ever hear of a turn signal?

18:19.399 --> 18:21.499
Just look, ALF.
Listen to me.

18:21.501 --> 18:23.401
Look at the road signs,
try to find out.

18:23.403 --> 18:26.137
Locate exactly where you are.

18:26.139 --> 18:30.608
Well, uh, I just passed
The Motel 6.

18:30.610 --> 18:33.544
Hey, they're having
a beekeeper's convention.

18:33.546 --> 18:36.814
Ouch! Ow! Ow! Ow!
Ooh, gotta go.

18:36.816 --> 18:39.584
Tell me!
Tell me where you are!

18:39.586 --> 18:42.220
(ALF)
'Okay, okay,
I'm right near the..'

18:42.222 --> 18:43.821
ALF! ALF..

18:45.158 --> 18:46.190
Got disconnected.

18:46.192 --> 18:47.458
Oh, no!

18:49.395 --> 18:51.262
Look, I can't give
you any more information.

18:51.264 --> 18:53.931
I just need to know which one
of your motels is having

18:53.933 --> 18:55.466
a beekeeper's convention?

18:56.302 --> 18:57.468
They all are?

18:58.438 --> 18:59.403
Thank you very much.

19:01.474 --> 19:03.274
- Well?
- Nothing.

19:03.276 --> 19:05.710
We even went to the police
to see if there'd been a report

19:05.712 --> 19:09.647
but, you know, aside from a pig
falling off of a U-Haul trailer

19:09.649 --> 19:11.883
and an inordinate
number of bee stings

19:11.885 --> 19:13.417
it-it's really,
it's been quite a quiet night.

19:13.419 --> 19:14.719
[tires screeching]

19:14.721 --> 19:15.953
ALF!

19:15.955 --> 19:17.622
[crashing]

19:21.661 --> 19:22.894
[groaning]

19:26.599 --> 19:28.833
ALF!
ALF, are you okay?

19:29.602 --> 19:31.836
Don't worry, I'm fine.

19:31.838 --> 19:35.339
But this phone is
a piece of junk.

19:35.341 --> 19:36.741
I'm gonna call Joel
just as soon as

19:36.743 --> 19:39.343
he gets back from the Springs.

19:39.345 --> 19:41.879
Forget the phone.
Forget Joel.

19:41.881 --> 19:46.417
You've just crashed
into our garage..

19:46.419 --> 19:49.620
...for the second time,
I might point out.

19:49.622 --> 19:52.723
I'm sorry, Willie.
I really am.

19:52.725 --> 19:54.892
I think I might need glasses.

19:56.362 --> 19:57.862
Glasses?

19:57.864 --> 20:00.998
I think you might
need a lawyer!

20:01.000 --> 20:02.733
Now, Willie, calm down.

20:04.537 --> 20:06.504
May I just say to you

20:06.506 --> 20:09.373
I think it's very
irresponsible of you to take

20:09.375 --> 20:11.008
the car out
on the road like this

20:11.010 --> 20:14.512
to endanger your life
and the lives of others

20:14.514 --> 20:17.682
and to make us worry.

20:17.684 --> 20:20.284
And this sort of thing
seems to be repeating itself

20:20.286 --> 20:23.321
over and over again.

20:23.323 --> 20:25.489
There have been
some fun times.

20:25.491 --> 20:27.391
Tell him, Kate.

20:27.393 --> 20:29.427
There have been
some fun times, ALF.

20:29.429 --> 20:32.463
A lot of fun times,
but this isn't one of 'em.

20:32.465 --> 20:35.333
Look at what you've done!

20:35.335 --> 20:36.801
Alright, alright, calm down.

20:36.803 --> 20:39.537
Don't worry about it, Willie.
I'll pay for it.

20:39.539 --> 20:41.672
And how do you
propose to do that?

20:41.674 --> 20:45.610
Well, I'll call Joel tomorrow,
I'll sell the car.

20:45.612 --> 20:48.613
And we'll use the money
to fix the garage.

20:48.615 --> 20:50.848
You'll do that?
You'll call Joel?

20:50.850 --> 20:52.817
Well, actually,
it'll be Joel's assistant.

20:52.819 --> 20:58.522
Because, as I have mentioned,
Joel is in the Springs.

20:58.524 --> 21:00.424
That sounds fair,
doesn't it, Willie?

21:00.426 --> 21:01.692
I suppose so.

21:01.694 --> 21:04.595
I-I suppose it does, ALF.

21:04.597 --> 21:07.398
- I'm glad you weren't hurt.
- Thanks.

21:07.400 --> 21:11.302
'Course, I'll want a complete
physical before I sign anything.

21:11.304 --> 21:13.704
Just kidding, just kidding.

21:13.706 --> 21:15.006
[telephone ringing]

21:15.008 --> 21:18.576
Oh, that'll be Mrs. Ochmonek
about the hedge.

21:18.578 --> 21:20.444
The hedge?

21:20.446 --> 21:22.413
I'll get it.

21:22.415 --> 21:23.714
(male #1)
'Mr. Tanner?'

21:23.716 --> 21:26.651
Uh, that'll be the people
across the street.

21:26.653 --> 21:29.587
Does your insurance
cover front porches?

21:29.589 --> 21:32.490
I'll be right back.
Don't leave town.

21:34.027 --> 21:38.462
ALF, I don't think I can ever
repay you for what you've done.

21:38.464 --> 21:40.097
[police siren wailing]

21:40.099 --> 21:42.600
What have you done?

21:42.602 --> 21:45.736
Well, uh, I ran over
a few front lawns.

21:45.738 --> 21:48.306
Clipped a couple of jay trees.

21:48.308 --> 21:49.573
The rest is a blur.

21:50.576 --> 21:53.311
I better go see
if I can help out.

21:53.313 --> 21:55.579
[siren wailing]

21:55.581 --> 21:57.615
[helicopter blades whirring]

21:58.618 --> 22:00.618
Think I'll turn in
early tonight.

22:05.058 --> 22:06.657
(ALF)
'Socket wrench.'

22:12.565 --> 22:13.998
Gasket.

22:18.905 --> 22:20.571
Gum.

22:29.916 --> 22:32.583
Say, I know you don't
like me to ask but..

22:32.585 --> 22:34.518
What's going on here?

22:34.520 --> 22:37.054
I'm getting the old
crate in shape, William.

22:37.056 --> 22:38.089
You're fixing my car?

22:38.091 --> 22:41.092
Hey, we have to
save what we can.

22:41.094 --> 22:43.761
Did I tell you
the mango grove went under?

22:43.763 --> 22:45.062
You mean, it went
out of business?

22:45.064 --> 22:47.498
Nope, it went under.

22:47.500 --> 22:49.734
What is a fault line, anyway?

22:49.736 --> 22:51.068
Under the ground?

22:51.070 --> 22:53.871
- Is that what Joel told you?
- I trust him.

22:53.873 --> 22:55.773
I'm gonna ask him
for the details

22:55.775 --> 22:57.842
when he gets back
from Paraguay.

22:57.844 --> 23:01.479
Anyway, there you go.
You're a one car family again.

23:01.481 --> 23:03.080
Well, thanks.

23:03.082 --> 23:04.482
- Ahh!
- No!

23:04.484 --> 23:06.550
[laughing]
Just kidding.

23:06.552 --> 23:08.085
See? Ha.

23:08.087 --> 23:11.989
- Why do you do that to me?
- Because it's funny, man.

23:13.926 --> 23:15.126
Say, uh..

23:15.128 --> 23:17.194
Where'd you ever learn about
fixing cars anyway?

23:17.196 --> 23:20.698
I used to watch "Route 66."
You pick things up.

23:21.734 --> 23:23.634
That's amazing.

23:23.636 --> 23:25.803
I'll tell you
what's more amazing.

23:25.805 --> 23:29.840
That George Maharis
never got another series.

23:29.842 --> 23:32.943
Anyway, the car's
purring like a kitten.

23:32.945 --> 23:35.780
Which reminds me,
I'm hungry.

23:35.782 --> 23:37.915
ALF, uh, I don't
know what to say.

23:37.917 --> 23:39.216
I don't know how to
thank you for this.

23:39.218 --> 23:41.152
No problem.

23:41.154 --> 23:45.623
I-I think I'll just, uh..
I think I'll just back up.

23:45.625 --> 23:47.158
Take it out for a spin.

23:49.529 --> 23:51.061
'Whoa! No!'

23:53.466 --> 23:54.932
Crowbar.

23:56.436 --> 23:59.103
[instrumental music]

24:04.177 --> 24:07.178
[theme music]

24:24.564 --> 24:27.064
[music continues]

24:31.637 --> 24:33.671
