WEBVTT

00:03.496 --> 00:04.962
DENNIS:<i> Uh... I feel like</i>
<i> you guys should have,</i>

00:04.964 --> 00:06.664
<i> like, dressed up</i>
<i> a little bit for this.</i>

00:06.666 --> 00:08.065
CHARLIE:<i> No, no, it sends the</i>
<i> wrong image, you know?</i>

00:08.067 --> 00:10.067
Uh, we're not selling a game
for squares,

00:10.069 --> 00:12.303
we're selling a game for, like,
everyday people like us, man.

00:12.305 --> 00:13.504
DENNIS: Right, yeah,
that's a good point.

00:13.506 --> 00:14.805
MAC: Oh, Frank,
Frank, Frank.

00:14.807 --> 00:15.973
You will never guess
what happened. Okay.

00:15.975 --> 00:17.174
So this guy comes in, right?

00:17.176 --> 00:18.409
We think he's just
a regular customer.

00:18.411 --> 00:19.810
We start chatting him up.

00:19.812 --> 00:21.579
Turns out, he's an
executive at Mattel.

00:21.581 --> 00:22.746
DEE: Yeah, so of course
we start talking

00:22.748 --> 00:23.981
to him about Chardee MacDennis,

00:23.983 --> 00:25.182
and he seemed totally into it.

00:25.184 --> 00:26.650
Yeah, he's coming
by today, man.

00:26.652 --> 00:27.918
We're gonna
pitch it to him.

00:27.920 --> 00:29.420
Maybe we could, uh, work in

00:29.422 --> 00:30.855
some of the ideas
I've been suggesting.

00:30.857 --> 00:32.656
Those aren't "ideas"
as much as they are...

00:32.658 --> 00:34.492
random acts
of violence.

00:34.494 --> 00:37.695
Well, you see, when I was a kid,
games were much more violent.

00:37.697 --> 00:39.697
I mean, we used to play
"Purple Nurple,"

00:39.699 --> 00:41.532
"Sock Full of Quarters,"
"Kick the Jew"...

00:41.534 --> 00:43.167
DEE: No, why don't you
try winning one time?

00:43.169 --> 00:45.503
And then you can start
throwing in new rules.

00:45.505 --> 00:47.505
How about we just change
the name of the game then?

00:47.507 --> 00:49.507
"Franken MacChardeeden."

00:49.509 --> 00:50.941
MAC: What?
That's terrible.

00:50.943 --> 00:51.942
First of all,

00:51.944 --> 00:53.544
your name isn't "Franken."

00:53.546 --> 00:55.379
Secondly, Chardee MacDennis
is just a working title.

00:55.381 --> 00:56.780
Technically, we're still
in arbitration.

00:56.782 --> 00:59.183
Last we left it,
Dee had filibustered,

00:59.185 --> 01:00.684
and Charlie had
a motion pending.

01:00.686 --> 01:02.186
And I will not yield
to the gentleman.

01:02.188 --> 01:03.621
'Cause you have no honor,
you goddamn bitch.

01:03.623 --> 01:05.356
You have no honor!

01:05.358 --> 01:07.191
You see what I'm talking about--
it's a whole thing, Frank.

01:07.193 --> 01:11.362
Then let's call it "Chardee
MacDennis 2: Electric Boogaloo."

01:11.364 --> 01:12.863
What?
What are you
talking about?

01:12.865 --> 01:14.732
What does that have
to do with anything?

01:14.734 --> 01:16.200
What made you just
think of that?

01:16.202 --> 01:17.868
It's not a break-dancing
competition.

01:17.870 --> 01:19.136
There's no
electricity involved.

01:19.138 --> 01:20.571
(door opens)
Uh-uh-uh-uh.

01:20.573 --> 01:24.041
Hello, hello.
Hey, there, how's it
going, uh... Andy, was it?

01:24.043 --> 01:25.709
Yes, exactly.
Ah, Andy, I want
you to meet Frank.

01:25.711 --> 01:26.877
Frank, uh, meet Andy
from Mattel.

01:26.879 --> 01:28.212
Hello, hello.

01:28.214 --> 01:30.047
I got to tell ya--
I'm pretty excited.

01:30.049 --> 01:32.716
Adult game play is
a fast-rising market,

01:32.718 --> 01:33.918
and we are always
on the lookout

01:33.920 --> 01:35.319
for something a little
out of the box.

01:35.321 --> 01:37.721
Oh, we-we can help
you there, bud.

01:37.723 --> 01:39.990
That's great. Now, what was
the name of the game again?

01:39.992 --> 01:43.627
Chardee MacDennis 2:
Electric Boogaloo.

02:08.788 --> 02:10.955
Okay, Andy, you're gonna like
this video we made for you.

02:10.957 --> 02:11.956
MAN: Fight milk.
(crow caws)

02:11.958 --> 02:13.023
Crow's egg.

02:13.960 --> 02:16.460
(echoing):
Chardee MacDennis.

02:16.462 --> 02:19.463
Chardee MacDennis is all your
favorite games rolled into one:

02:19.465 --> 02:22.166
<i> Mouse Trap,</i>
<i> Chutes and Ladders, Sorry...</i>

02:24.103 --> 02:26.470
But it's not exactly
like those things.

02:26.472 --> 02:29.206
It's also like Boggle,
Wheel of Fortune, Risk.

02:29.208 --> 02:30.608
MAN:
<i> Chardee MacDennis!</i>

02:30.610 --> 02:31.976
What other games
do you like?

02:31.978 --> 02:33.210
It's like
those other games, too!

02:33.212 --> 02:34.445
But more better.

02:34.447 --> 02:36.780
And different enough legally.

02:36.782 --> 02:38.115
I'm a lawyer.
Shh!

02:38.117 --> 02:39.149
I'm a lawyer
in this part.

02:39.151 --> 02:40.284
We're like Moby...

02:40.286 --> 02:42.152
re-e-e-e-emix!

02:42.154 --> 02:44.388
(air horn blares)
MAN:<i> Ch-Ch-Chardee MacDennis!</i>

02:44.390 --> 02:46.390
Regular board games
should be called...

02:46.392 --> 02:48.659
"I'm bored... games."

02:48.661 --> 02:50.294
I don't get that one.

02:50.296 --> 02:53.130
I... No, I told you not to...
Stay out of my peripheral...

02:53.132 --> 02:54.732
Do you want a game that lulls
you into a sense

02:54.734 --> 02:56.133
<i> of security but surprises you</i>

02:56.135 --> 02:58.402
<i> with constant rule changes?</i>
<i> Then you want</i>

02:58.404 --> 02:59.403
the game of games.

02:59.405 --> 03:00.638
Mac, back up.
Sorry.

03:00.640 --> 03:04.074
MAN (thundering):
<i> Chardee MacDennis!</i>

03:04.076 --> 03:06.810
We always win.
And they always lose.

03:06.812 --> 03:08.412
CHARLIE: What are you guys
doing over there?
Oh, shit.

03:08.414 --> 03:10.314
(static hissing)

03:10.316 --> 03:11.915
W-Why'd you put that in?
Yeah, what was that?

03:11.917 --> 03:13.417
Factually accurate.

03:13.419 --> 03:16.186
So, Andy,
what did you think?

03:16.188 --> 03:18.255
I... got to say,

03:18.257 --> 03:20.157
it's a little
confusing.

03:20.159 --> 03:22.593
Uh, can't we just
play the game?

03:22.595 --> 03:23.827
Ooh.
Ooh, ooh, ooh.
Yeah.

03:23.829 --> 03:25.529
That wouldn't
be good.

03:25.531 --> 03:28.666
Yeah, see, we tend to get a
little competitive when we play.

03:28.668 --> 03:30.501
You know, we're not exactly
a mellow bunch.

03:30.503 --> 03:31.702
Right.
That'll be fun.
Plus, that's the best way

03:31.704 --> 03:34.271
for me to understand the game.

03:34.273 --> 03:37.007
But that's what...
why you would understand...
Yeah, that's why we did that.

03:37.009 --> 03:38.776
Okay, let me confer
with my associates for a minute.

03:38.778 --> 03:40.611
Why don't you grab a drink?
It's o-on the house, of course.

03:40.613 --> 03:42.446
Um, guys, can we talk?
Uh, cool, man.

03:42.448 --> 03:45.015
I think we can probably, um...

03:45.017 --> 03:47.017
We can't...
No, no, no... no, no,

03:47.019 --> 03:48.686
I-I think we can.
Uh, we can do this, guys.

03:48.688 --> 03:50.354
We just got to be...
just got to make it fun.

03:50.356 --> 03:51.855
You know what we have to do?
Is we have to not care

03:51.857 --> 03:53.857
about who wins.
Just for this time.
Yes.

03:53.859 --> 03:55.359
Who cares?
That'll help.
Nice. That will help.

03:55.361 --> 03:56.894
We just have to sell the game.
Let's just sell it. Okay.

03:56.896 --> 03:58.796
We can do it. All right, so,
Frank, you'll be on Andy's team.

03:58.798 --> 04:00.397
Wait, don't
stick me with him. He-he

04:00.399 --> 04:01.532
doesn't know the goddamn rules.
Oh, my God.

04:01.534 --> 04:02.533
I'm gonna get crushed again.

04:02.535 --> 04:04.234
(overlapping chatter)

04:04.236 --> 04:06.303
Shut up. Shut up.
It's not about
winning or losing.

04:06.305 --> 04:07.705
Exactly. It doesn't
matter. It's fun.
We're not gonna care...

04:07.707 --> 04:09.540
It's fun.
So we'll just...

04:09.542 --> 04:10.708
we'll keep our emotions
in check.

04:10.710 --> 04:11.742
Yeah.
Sure.

04:11.744 --> 04:12.743
Just be like:
(exhales)

04:12.745 --> 04:13.711
(all exhaling)

04:13.713 --> 04:14.712
Exactly.

04:14.714 --> 04:15.779
(exhaling continues)

04:20.052 --> 04:21.385
Gentlemen,
good luck to you.

04:21.387 --> 04:23.387
And to yous.
And to
yous all.

04:23.389 --> 04:25.055
This is nice--
a little role playing.

04:25.057 --> 04:26.724
Very big
in gaming right now.

04:26.726 --> 04:28.425
This also celebrates
sportsmanship.

04:28.427 --> 04:30.094
Yes, indeed. Yeah, well,
you're totally getting it.

04:30.096 --> 04:31.829
You're catching on.
Oh, by the way, there used to be

04:31.831 --> 04:34.264
a couple rules about not cursing
and not asking questions

04:34.266 --> 04:36.066
in certain rounds, but I think
we should do away with that

04:36.068 --> 04:37.901
for now, because it's your
first time playing and, guys,

04:37.903 --> 04:40.170
we don't want
anybody blacking out.

04:40.172 --> 04:41.739
Yeah, no problem.
Right, that's fine.
I think that'll be fine.

04:41.741 --> 04:42.840
We're flexible.
It's a good idea.

04:42.842 --> 04:44.274
Okay, are we ready?

04:44.276 --> 04:46.276
Three, two, one.

04:46.278 --> 04:48.979
Gentlemen...
suck my dick.

04:53.419 --> 04:55.919
(shouting gibberish)

04:55.921 --> 04:57.087
Hut,

04:57.089 --> 04:59.423
hut, hut.

04:59.425 --> 05:02.159
(playing bugle)

05:14.540 --> 05:16.039
What the hell's going on?

05:16.041 --> 05:18.308
Oh, uh, this is our
flag-raising ceremony.

05:18.310 --> 05:20.277
Yeah, we used to do
the Maori war dance,

05:20.279 --> 05:21.879
but that-that got us
a little too riled up.

05:21.881 --> 05:23.380
Either way, this is
all about intimidation

05:23.382 --> 05:24.948
and showing off
your prowess.

05:24.950 --> 05:26.116
Uh, think of it like

05:26.118 --> 05:27.951
the Indian-Pakistani
border ceremony

05:27.953 --> 05:29.052
that they do over there.

05:34.794 --> 05:36.293
Now, this is Mac
and Charlie's flag,

05:36.295 --> 05:38.128
which, as you can see,
is fairly badly burned.

05:38.130 --> 05:39.797
Not only
does the winner get to

05:39.799 --> 05:41.231
stomp the loser's
game pieces,

05:41.233 --> 05:43.200
but they also get to
burn their flag up.

05:47.640 --> 05:50.007
Now, you'll notice
that the Golden Geese flag

05:50.009 --> 05:51.508
is unsullied.
You'll also notice that

05:51.510 --> 05:53.010
Mac and Charlie's flag is
just a little weird,

05:53.012 --> 05:54.845
and that's because
their original name

05:54.847 --> 05:56.513
was the Thundercats,

05:56.515 --> 05:59.249
uh... but they were
confused by that.

05:59.251 --> 06:00.751
Well, 'cause we're not cats.
Yeah.

06:00.753 --> 06:04.087
We're not cats.
So, then, how could we...

06:04.089 --> 06:05.489
Mm-hmm. Even though
it's the name they chose.

06:05.491 --> 06:07.257
So they went with
the Thundermen.

06:07.259 --> 06:09.426
(playing quavering note)

06:12.198 --> 06:14.698
This brings us
to Frank's flag,

06:14.700 --> 06:17.100
which is, uh... yeah,
it's just unfortunate.

06:17.102 --> 06:18.869
FRANK:
It's four Fs.

06:18.871 --> 06:20.537
I didn't know it was
gonna come off like that.

06:20.539 --> 06:22.039
Pretty sure you did.

06:22.041 --> 06:25.175
(playing rousing tune)

06:33.519 --> 06:37.354
Okay, Andy, Level 1 is Trivia,
Puzzles and Artistry.

06:37.356 --> 06:38.789
The first team
to get three points

06:38.791 --> 06:40.958
moves their game piece
to the next level.

06:40.960 --> 06:43.293
All right.
Here we go.
All right.

06:43.295 --> 06:47.231
What Philly celebrity would you
most want to have a drink with?
Oh, shit,

06:47.233 --> 06:48.866
okay, yeah, you know what--
a lot of the questions

06:48.868 --> 06:50.901
are opinion-based.
Heads up.
Ah. Okay... I-I see.

06:50.903 --> 06:53.303
Uh, all right, this is,
uh, let me guess. Um...

06:53.305 --> 06:55.706
Oh: Dr. J.

06:55.708 --> 06:57.374
That's not it!
All right,
all right.

06:57.376 --> 06:59.076
Play it cool,
play it cool.
Okay, okay, sorry.

06:59.078 --> 07:01.044
Yeah, all right. That is wrong,
though. You wouldn't

07:01.046 --> 07:02.546
want to have a drink with him.
Dee, chance to steal.

07:02.548 --> 07:04.381
Bill Cosby.
Yes!
All right.

07:04.383 --> 07:05.716
Yeah! Point for us.
Shit.

07:05.718 --> 07:06.817
A lot of the questions
are outdated.

07:06.819 --> 07:07.885
Yeah, yeah, they are

07:07.887 --> 07:09.319
a little outdated.

07:09.321 --> 07:10.888
Okay, our turn,
our turn.

07:10.890 --> 07:12.890
Um, artistry. And it's
an all-play, guys.

07:12.892 --> 07:14.491
Oh!
Oh!
All right, now,

07:14.493 --> 07:17.661
a member of each team
must make this clue out of clay

07:17.663 --> 07:19.796
while the other member
tries to guess what it is.

07:21.600 --> 07:22.900
Okay, uh, penis.
What?

07:22.902 --> 07:25.002
Uh, lip-penis.
What? No, look, look.

07:25.004 --> 07:26.436
Oh, hard penis.

07:26.438 --> 07:27.571
A hard clay penis.
Oh...

07:27.573 --> 07:29.006
Gargoyle inside.
No?

07:29.008 --> 07:30.741
It's a-a, okay,
a chopped-off head,

07:30.743 --> 07:32.576
a decapitat...
uh, head in a box!
Head in a...?

07:32.578 --> 07:34.077
Dee, I'm gonna put
your head in a box

07:34.079 --> 07:35.345
if you don't start
getting the answer right.

07:35.347 --> 07:36.413
Goddamn it!
A heart, it's a heart!

07:36.415 --> 07:37.915
Uh, it's, uh...

07:37.917 --> 07:39.349
it's, uh, love!
Love!

07:39.351 --> 07:40.350
Oh!
He got it!
Was that it?

07:40.352 --> 07:41.785
(whoops)

07:41.787 --> 07:43.587
Get another
card.
How do you make a heart?

07:43.589 --> 07:45.355
If the... Love?

07:45.357 --> 07:47.758
Yeah, because I was making,
uh, Cupid's arrow, dude.

07:47.760 --> 07:49.459
Well, why does it have
a big vein running through it?

07:49.461 --> 07:51.695
Because that's the streak
as it flies through the air.

07:51.697 --> 07:53.697
Come... At least I didn't
put a woman's head in a box.

07:53.699 --> 07:56.767
This is not a woman's head
in a box, you sick freak.

07:56.769 --> 07:59.136
This is a woman's
head in a freezer.

07:59.138 --> 08:00.604
And it's supposed to represent
the preservation

08:00.606 --> 08:02.272
of love forever
and ever.

08:02.274 --> 08:04.608
Whatever, dude. It's our turn,
it's our turn. We go.

08:04.610 --> 08:06.276
BOTH:
No puzzles, no puzzles,
no puzzles, no puzzles,

08:06.278 --> 08:07.611
no puzzles, no puzzles...

08:07.613 --> 08:09.613
Puzzles.
Oh!

08:09.615 --> 08:11.148
Put this bottle
back together.

08:11.150 --> 08:12.649
Oh, shit.
Oh. Yeah.

08:12.651 --> 08:13.650
Oh, that's interesting.

08:13.652 --> 08:15.285
What bottle?

08:16.622 --> 08:18.689
This one.

08:24.229 --> 08:27.164
Now just be very,
very careful.
Okay.

08:27.166 --> 08:30.334
Final touches,
final touches.
Watch that glue string--

08:30.336 --> 08:31.802
don't pull it apart.
Okay, okay, okay.

08:31.804 --> 08:33.804
Okay, okay.
All right.
Ready, ready?

08:33.806 --> 08:36.640
Okay, okay,
okay... okay.

08:36.642 --> 08:40.143
Okay, very...
Very careful.
Very, very careful.

08:40.145 --> 08:41.845
It held.
It held!

08:41.847 --> 08:45.148
It held!
I swallowed a little
glass, but it held, man!

08:45.150 --> 08:46.850
You see, that's what I'm talking
about-- you sacrifice,

08:46.852 --> 08:48.251
you put the work in...
That's right!

08:48.253 --> 08:49.753
you earn that card.

08:49.755 --> 08:50.754
We're catching up to 'em.
Hey... Okay,

08:50.756 --> 08:52.756
it's our turn, then.

08:52.758 --> 08:54.925
Dennis and Dee
skip right to Level 2.

08:54.927 --> 08:56.927
Yes, yes!
Aw...
Aw...

08:56.929 --> 08:58.228
Face, face!
(squawks)

09:04.103 --> 09:06.670
Due to some alcohol-related
cheating, we decided

09:06.672 --> 09:08.105
to incorporate IVs

09:08.107 --> 09:10.007
to keep everything
on the up-and-up.

09:10.009 --> 09:11.608
You guys were the ones
that were cheating.
Yeah, yeah.

09:11.610 --> 09:13.276
Now, I feel like Andy
has to have one of these.

09:13.278 --> 09:14.544
Well, Andy's our guest.
We don't want to be

09:14.546 --> 09:16.279
poking him with needles.

09:16.281 --> 09:18.215
Unfair, unfair!
Yeah, unfair, unfair, unfair.

09:18.217 --> 09:20.884
Hey, hey, as you can see,
Mac and Charlie

09:20.886 --> 09:23.720
are a little worked up about
never having won the game.
Ever.

09:23.722 --> 09:25.956
I'm a little concerned
about the safety of this.

09:25.958 --> 09:27.357
The... Why... Oh, oh,
If it were beer?

09:27.359 --> 09:29.292
no, no, no, no--
we're mainlining wine.

09:29.294 --> 09:31.528
It's not beer. We switched
Level 2 to wine because

09:31.530 --> 09:33.964
you can't mainline beer because
it's got bubbles in it and shit.
CHARLIE: Yeah, yeah.

09:33.966 --> 09:35.799
We tried-- it was bad.
I'm not sure it's safe

09:35.801 --> 09:38.635
for people to put those
beverages directly into their...
Time!

09:38.637 --> 09:42.039
(blasting note)

09:42.041 --> 09:45.475
(gasps)
Oh!
(grunts)

09:48.547 --> 09:51.415
Okay, Andy, welcome
to Round 2 (Body):

09:51.417 --> 09:53.984
Physical Challenge,
Pain and Endurance.

09:53.986 --> 09:55.419
Okay, now, we've added
a new challenge

09:55.421 --> 09:57.421
to Level 2-- this is,
this is really exciting.

09:57.423 --> 10:00.057
So what you do-- you spin the
globe, you point your finger.

10:00.059 --> 10:02.759
Wherever your finger lands,
you have to speak in the accent

10:02.761 --> 10:04.227
of that region for
the rest of the round,

10:04.229 --> 10:05.495
otherwise,
you gotta drink.

10:05.497 --> 10:06.897
That sounds fun.
That's a great idea.

10:06.899 --> 10:08.165
Isn't that good?
Isn't that good?

10:08.167 --> 10:09.599
Let's go.
Uh... ha!

10:09.601 --> 10:11.068
Russia!

10:11.070 --> 10:13.437
Oh, okay, so I got it.
I guess I...

10:13.439 --> 10:15.439
(Russian accent):
I guess I can do that.

10:15.441 --> 10:16.740
Huh?
(Russian accent): You do Russia.

10:16.742 --> 10:17.908
Hey, look at Andy, look at Andy.

10:17.910 --> 10:18.909
Pretty good,
man, pretty good.

10:18.911 --> 10:20.610
(overlapping chatter)

10:20.612 --> 10:21.778
DENNIS:
What do you got?
"Brasial."

10:21.780 --> 10:23.080
No, Brazil.
Mm-hmm.

10:23.082 --> 10:25.015
Wh-What's the accent
of Brazil?

10:25.017 --> 10:27.017
It's a, it's a country in South
America-- why don't we say

10:27.019 --> 10:29.086
any Latin American
accent'll do?
Any Latin American? Okay.

10:29.088 --> 10:31.955
(bad Mexican accent):
Okay, homie. Uh...
<i> Orale,</i> homes.

10:31.957 --> 10:35.459
Yeah, I can
do that. Yeah.
Okay, man. Nachos.

10:35.461 --> 10:38.261
Oh, real racist with it, huh?
Yeah, that is extremely
racist-- and by the way,

10:38.263 --> 10:41.264
that's more of a Los Angeles
sort of Mexican cholo vibe.

10:41.266 --> 10:43.767
Let's go... let's go see
the Dodgers play the Lakers.
Low rider.

10:43.769 --> 10:45.702
Okay. Uh, Dee, you
want to spin for us?

10:45.704 --> 10:47.204
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Jesus Christ.

10:48.941 --> 10:51.441
Oh! Ah, would you
look at that--

10:51.443 --> 10:53.477
Philadelphia.
FRANK:
That shouldn't be on there.

10:53.479 --> 10:55.712
You barely spinned it, homes.
That's bullshit, man.

10:55.714 --> 10:58.215
(Philadelphia accent):
Hallelujah. Looks like
the tide's turned.

10:58.217 --> 11:00.217
Yeah, looks like
we got an advantage

11:00.219 --> 11:02.619
over yous guys, huh, Den?

11:03.956 --> 11:05.288
(with accent):
What is going on?

11:05.290 --> 11:06.957
What the hell is that?

11:06.959 --> 11:09.326
My Philly accent.

11:09.328 --> 11:11.128
Wow, that's not
even close.

11:11.130 --> 11:13.497
Drink, homes.
Ow! Okay, slower.

11:13.499 --> 11:15.398
All right.

11:15.400 --> 11:18.468
Physical challenge.
And this one's an all-play.

11:18.470 --> 11:19.803
Oh!
Hey!
Okay,

11:19.805 --> 11:21.138
everybody.
This is good. We like...

11:21.140 --> 11:22.739
Hands on a bird body!

11:22.741 --> 11:24.007
(groans)
A member from
each team

11:24.009 --> 11:25.509
must try and
keep their hand

11:25.511 --> 11:28.311
on Dee's bony body for
as long as they can.

11:28.313 --> 11:30.847
(groans)
Dis is shit.
Dis is not good.

11:30.849 --> 11:32.415
I don't understand.

11:32.417 --> 11:34.651
(exhales through teeth)

11:34.653 --> 11:38.255
Hang in there, homes.
I can't do it, "mang."
I can't do it.

11:38.257 --> 11:39.489
You barely even put your
hand on there already.

11:39.491 --> 11:40.991
Hang in there, man.
I know, but...

11:40.993 --> 11:42.826
Ah! I can't do it,
I can't do it!
Oh! Ha!

11:42.828 --> 11:44.761
I can't even do it.
Ay, ay, ay!

11:44.763 --> 11:46.763
Mac and Charlie
are out!

11:46.765 --> 11:48.765
Hey, why'd you do that?

11:48.767 --> 11:50.534
I couldn't do it!
Ay, ay, ay!

11:50.536 --> 11:53.003
Oh, violation!
That's not L.A. Mexican.

11:53.005 --> 11:55.005
That's, like,
Cartoon Mexican.

11:55.007 --> 11:56.540
We barely even
switched it, homie.
No, I don't know.

11:56.542 --> 11:58.108
I'll have a drink, all right?
You got to drink, too.

11:58.110 --> 12:00.043
Oh...
What is so hard

12:00.045 --> 12:01.878
about keeping one
hand on this woman?

12:01.880 --> 12:04.214
She's a very pleasant woman.
She's a very, very pretty woman.

12:04.216 --> 12:07.217
Ugh. Don't sexualize her, dude.
This is bad enough as it is.

12:07.219 --> 12:10.020
Vhat is the matter, Dennis?

12:10.022 --> 12:12.355
Vhy are you zo uncomfortable?

12:12.357 --> 12:13.890
Because the closeness

12:13.892 --> 12:16.293
of your hand to her breast...

12:16.295 --> 12:17.694
Stop.
Yeah, stop.
...which is

12:17.696 --> 12:20.630
making you want to have sex
with her?

12:20.632 --> 12:22.899
Don't, don't...
oh, goddamn it! Ugh!
Oh... Oh!

12:22.901 --> 12:24.367
(gasps)
Wait, what's...

12:24.369 --> 12:25.869
what's going on?
You stupid idiot.

12:25.871 --> 12:27.871
Oh, my God, you glued
your hand to her!

12:27.873 --> 12:29.306
Cheater! Cheater!
Cheater!

12:29.308 --> 12:31.541
Oh, is that the accent drop?
Yeah, yeah,

12:31.543 --> 12:33.376
all accents are dropped
the minute someone

12:33.378 --> 12:34.644
gets caught cheating.
Yeah, yeah, we
have to be able

12:34.646 --> 12:36.046
to break them in
our native tongue

12:36.048 --> 12:37.714
to allow for
maximum shame.

12:37.716 --> 12:38.982
Shame, shame, shame...
Shame, shame...

12:38.984 --> 12:41.284
(all shouting "Shame!")

12:43.222 --> 12:45.555
So... so no more IVs?

12:45.557 --> 12:47.891
No, no, no, no.
No, no, no, no.
That's a Level 2 game.

12:47.893 --> 12:49.893
You don't want
to mainline liquor, buddy.
You don't want to do it.

12:49.895 --> 12:51.494
Still a pretty
stiff drink.

12:51.496 --> 12:52.596
Oh, yeah.
Things get
ratcheted up

12:52.598 --> 12:53.930
in Level 3.

12:53.932 --> 12:55.398
They even get worse
in Level 4.

12:55.400 --> 12:57.067
There is no Level 4.

12:57.069 --> 13:00.270
Yes, there is:
Mind, Body, Spirit, Horror.

13:00.272 --> 13:02.505
Stop, Frank. Come on.
There's no Horror level.

13:02.507 --> 13:04.674
Look, Andy, his ideas
don't represent the game.

13:04.676 --> 13:06.076
They don't represent us.

13:06.078 --> 13:08.445
Okay, pick a card now...
Yeah, whoa!

13:08.447 --> 13:10.580
Shits and Ladders.

13:10.582 --> 13:11.848
Oh!
(chuckles)

13:11.850 --> 13:13.750
Sort of a play
on Chutes and Ladders.

13:13.752 --> 13:16.686
Oh, yeah.
Each member must take a laxative
and get on a ladder.

13:16.688 --> 13:19.456
The one who can hold it in
the longest wins.
FRANK: Love this one.

13:19.458 --> 13:21.591
Also known
as Shoots and Splatters.

13:21.593 --> 13:23.093
Poops and Bladders!

13:23.095 --> 13:25.295
(laughter)
Andy!

13:25.297 --> 13:27.931
I'll go get the laxatives.
All right,
All right.

13:27.933 --> 13:30.200
FRANK:
Here you go.

13:30.202 --> 13:31.935
Strongest stuff on the market.

13:31.937 --> 13:34.604
All right.
All right.

13:34.606 --> 13:36.273
(grunts)

13:36.275 --> 13:37.941
Mm. Oh, that's strong.
Ugh!

13:37.943 --> 13:39.776
I don't like it.
Okay, to the ladders!

13:39.778 --> 13:41.311
(groans)

13:41.313 --> 13:43.113
I'm already feeling
a twinge.
(yawns)

13:43.115 --> 13:45.115
Yeah, I-I feel something.

13:45.117 --> 13:47.117
I don't feel like I
have to poop, though.

13:47.119 --> 13:50.120
I feel weird.
I kind of feel crazy.
Like, what is that?

13:50.122 --> 13:53.957
That isn't a laxative,
is it, Frank?

13:53.959 --> 13:55.625
Nope.

13:55.627 --> 13:58.561
Welcome to Level 4,

13:58.563 --> 13:59.963
(echoing):
Horror.

13:59.965 --> 14:02.465
(distorted laughter)

14:12.244 --> 14:16.646
Oh. What is this?

14:16.648 --> 14:19.149
Wake up, guys.
Wake up.
What's going on?

14:19.151 --> 14:20.383
(grunting)

14:21.420 --> 14:22.819
(groaning)

14:22.821 --> 14:24.487
FRANK:
Hello, gang.

14:24.489 --> 14:27.991
The keys to your cuffs

14:27.993 --> 14:29.693
have been sewn
into your forearm.

14:29.695 --> 14:33.663
Beside you are some tweezers

14:33.665 --> 14:37.767
attached to a car battery.

14:37.769 --> 14:42.038
Last team out of the room loses.

14:42.040 --> 14:43.940
Frank, this is insane.
Let us out of here!

14:43.942 --> 14:45.608
What are you doing?
Everything has
to be based

14:45.610 --> 14:48.712
on an existing board game!
That's the whole thing!

14:48.714 --> 14:51.348
Oh, but it is, Dennis.

14:51.350 --> 14:53.950
Ever hear of a game called...

14:53.952 --> 14:56.086
Operation?
(cackles)

14:57.055 --> 14:58.555
Oh, shit.

14:58.557 --> 15:00.690
He's got a point.

15:00.692 --> 15:02.025
Damn it.
Let's go.

15:02.027 --> 15:03.560
(grunting)
(zapping)

15:03.562 --> 15:06.796
(shouting)
(zapping continues)

15:06.798 --> 15:08.698
This game is totally insane!
DENNIS: Don't give up
on the game!

15:08.700 --> 15:10.700
The game is fine! (groans)
No, no, no, no.

15:10.702 --> 15:12.302
No, this isn't representative
of us...

15:12.304 --> 15:14.070
Oh, God!
Oh!

15:14.072 --> 15:15.872
Oh, I'm gonna stop!
I'm gonna stop! I'm out!

15:15.874 --> 15:17.874
No, I quit, too. I quit.
I can't do it.

15:17.876 --> 15:20.043
I got it, I got it,
I got it, I got it!
DENNIS: Oh, God!

15:20.045 --> 15:21.878
It's just the bone.
DEE:
Charlie!

15:21.880 --> 15:24.481
Oh, Jesus
Christ, dude!
Oh!

15:24.483 --> 15:27.050
Oh! I think
you shit your pants, too.

15:27.052 --> 15:29.419
Well, it was probably just
the laxative kicking in, man.
It wasn't

15:29.421 --> 15:31.755
a goddamn laxative, Charlie!
You just pooped your pants!

15:31.757 --> 15:33.890
You guys quit! You quit

15:33.892 --> 15:35.558
and we won the game!

15:35.560 --> 15:37.227
(grunts)
Finally.

15:37.229 --> 15:40.096
Finally, I won the game.

15:40.098 --> 15:43.066
This is not what I signed up
for, you donkey-brained maniac!

15:43.068 --> 15:44.734
Uncuff me!
Cool it, cool it.

15:44.736 --> 15:47.337
Take it easy. I mean,
it's just a... it's just

15:47.339 --> 15:48.671
a simple mind game.

15:48.673 --> 15:50.440
No one had a
key on 'em.

15:50.442 --> 15:53.910
You know, I knew
they'd cave like bitches.

15:53.912 --> 15:55.278
DENNIS:
Hold on a second.
Wait a second.

15:55.280 --> 15:57.580
Andy, did you just call him
"donkey-brained"?

15:57.582 --> 16:00.583
Yeah. What? It's an expression.
What did you mean by

16:00.585 --> 16:02.285
"not what I signed up for"?

16:02.287 --> 16:04.187
Do you two know
each other?

16:04.189 --> 16:05.755
No!
No...

16:05.757 --> 16:07.757
No. No.
No.

16:07.759 --> 16:09.759
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait-- look at this, guys.

16:09.761 --> 16:13.263
"Mattel" is spelled wrong
on his business card.
That says "Matel."

16:13.265 --> 16:15.265
I'm calling this number.

16:15.267 --> 16:17.767
(phone ringing)

16:17.769 --> 16:22.372
FRANK (recorded):
Welcome to the home
of Wolf Cola...

16:22.374 --> 16:24.941
(gasps)
(shouting "Cheaters!")

16:24.943 --> 16:26.776
Oh, okay, Frank,
so you clearly

16:26.778 --> 16:29.045
just hired this guy
so that you could win

16:29.047 --> 16:30.713
and put your stamp
on the game!

16:30.715 --> 16:32.949
No, there's no truth
in that at all.
No.

16:32.951 --> 16:34.517
Tell 'em, Andy.

16:38.056 --> 16:39.456
(door slams)

16:39.458 --> 16:40.790
MAC:
What?!

16:40.792 --> 16:43.460
It was all bullshit?
It was just a hoax?

16:43.462 --> 16:45.562
Yeah.
DENNIS: Wait, wait, wait,

16:45.564 --> 16:47.397
wait, wait...
Unreal.

16:47.399 --> 16:50.800
So, then, if this isn't about
selling the game anymore...

16:50.802 --> 16:52.869
Well, then it's
about winning.

16:55.474 --> 16:57.640
DENNIS:
Okay, here we go.

16:57.642 --> 16:59.843
Public humiliation.

16:59.845 --> 17:01.377
Are you ready, Charles?

17:03.582 --> 17:05.849
Dude, are you-you
sure you're okay?

17:05.851 --> 17:08.685
You might've lost a lot of
blood from digging around in
there with the tweezers.

17:08.687 --> 17:10.753
He's around it. Yep.

17:10.755 --> 17:12.989
Here we go.
Okay, then here we go.
You have to withstand

17:12.991 --> 17:15.592
one full minute
of intense berating.

17:17.429 --> 17:18.928
He's ready. "Lights on,"
he said. "Lights on."
Okay.

17:18.930 --> 17:20.997
But it's not gonna be from us.

17:20.999 --> 17:24.934
Nope. Not from us.
It's from<i> her!</i>

17:24.936 --> 17:26.936
Ow! Ow! You're holding
my hair!
Okay, hold on a second.

17:26.938 --> 17:30.206
Ow, let go! Oh, my God,
that hurt so much!
Goddamn it.

17:30.208 --> 17:32.041
Okay, well, you know what, it
was supposed to be a big reveal.

17:32.043 --> 17:34.010
I had a whole thing planned.
What's wrong with you?

17:34.012 --> 17:36.346
You know what, of course you
ruined it-- you are the worst.

17:36.348 --> 17:37.847
THE WAITRESS:
What? Oh, my God,
what is that smell?

17:37.849 --> 17:41.384
Is that poop? Did you poop
in your pants, Charlie?

17:41.386 --> 17:43.520
Yeah.
Oh, gross.

17:43.522 --> 17:46.356
That's so disgusting.
This is gonna be so easy.

17:46.358 --> 17:48.358
No, dude, don't
listen to them, okay?

17:48.360 --> 17:49.859
(sniffles)
You can do this,
Charlie.

17:49.861 --> 17:51.561
If you can not cry
for just one minute,

17:51.563 --> 17:54.197
just one minute,
we win the goddamn game.

17:54.199 --> 17:55.198
Yeah, man.
You can do this.

17:55.200 --> 17:56.566
Are you ready?
Yeah.

17:56.568 --> 17:58.067
(grunts)
Okay, yeah.

17:58.069 --> 17:59.903
All right.
Okay. Okay.
Here we go.

17:59.905 --> 18:01.738
DENNIS:
Ready, get set, go.

18:01.740 --> 18:03.973
Charlie Kelly, I have been
waiting for this

18:03.975 --> 18:05.375
for a long time,

18:05.377 --> 18:07.377
you poop-smelling

18:07.379 --> 18:09.379
(distorted):
trash person.

18:09.381 --> 18:11.047
Your face,
it looks like a troll!

18:11.049 --> 18:13.082
You look
like you have troll features!

18:13.084 --> 18:14.918
You stalked me! There's
something wrong with you!

18:14.920 --> 18:17.554
Your brain is broken!
I hate you!

18:17.556 --> 18:19.989
I hope you die!
And I hope you go to hell!
Three! Two!

18:19.991 --> 18:21.658
And I hope it burns!
One!

18:21.660 --> 18:23.726
(distorted shouting)
You did it! You did it!

18:23.728 --> 18:25.228
Holy shit!

18:25.230 --> 18:27.830
MAC:
<i> We won! Thundermen!</i>

18:27.832 --> 18:29.832
DENNIS:<i> Charlie? </i>
DEE:
<i>Come on, buddy, you can do it.</i>

18:29.834 --> 18:31.100
Come on, wake up,
Charlie, wake up.

18:31.102 --> 18:32.769
I don't know
if he's gonna wake up.

18:32.771 --> 18:35.238
I don't either.
Charlie, come on, buddy.

18:35.240 --> 18:37.073
Charlie, are you okay?
Charlie... Charlie,
open your eyes.

18:37.075 --> 18:40.510
DENNIS: Charlie?
Oh. Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. There he is.

18:40.512 --> 18:41.778
Oh, thank God.
Oh, thank God.
We thought we lost you, buddy.

18:41.780 --> 18:43.780
We thought we lost you.
Hey.

18:43.782 --> 18:46.749
Oh, my God.
Oh, man. What happened?
God... like, all I remember is,

18:46.751 --> 18:49.085
like, winning the game
and then passing out.

18:49.087 --> 18:50.920
Is that how you
remember it?
Yeah.
Yeah.

18:50.922 --> 18:53.122
No.
No, no, you cried
like a baby.

18:53.124 --> 18:55.592
Yeah, pretty much right when
the waitress started talking,

18:55.594 --> 18:57.293
you cried like a little bitch.
Quite a bit.

18:57.295 --> 18:59.262
Yeah.
Yeah. You-you
must have been

18:59.264 --> 19:01.431
hallucinating
from all the blood poisoning.

19:01.433 --> 19:04.434
So... did you guys win?

19:04.436 --> 19:06.369
Yeah. Big-time.
We always do.

19:06.371 --> 19:09.138
So did you crush
our game pieces?

19:09.140 --> 19:11.474
No. Oh, my God, Charlie, no.
Charlie, we weren't
even thinking

19:11.476 --> 19:12.875
about the game anymore.

19:12.877 --> 19:14.110
No one was.
We were terrified for you.

19:14.112 --> 19:15.278
With you in that condition?

19:15.280 --> 19:16.646
Really? Oh, thank you.

19:16.648 --> 19:18.948
Oh, thank you
so much, guys.
Oh, God.

19:18.950 --> 19:22.552
Are you kidding me?
That's, like, really, the
nicest thing you've ever done.

19:22.554 --> 19:25.288
Uh, Dee, can you...
Oh, yeah,
yeah, yeah.

19:25.290 --> 19:28.057
(sighs) Charlie, no,
we wouldn't have done that

19:28.059 --> 19:29.726
with you... with
you in that condition.

19:29.728 --> 19:31.160
Yeah. It-it...
No.

19:31.162 --> 19:33.963
But now that you're
conscious, you know...

19:33.965 --> 19:37.300
Dee, are you, uh,
all set back there?

19:37.302 --> 19:39.802
Yep.

19:43.241 --> 19:45.341
Loser. Yeah!

19:45.343 --> 19:47.010
(both taunting, screeching)

19:47.012 --> 19:50.013
DEE: Yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah!

19:50.015 --> 19:51.914
(both honking)

19:51.916 --> 19:53.816
Yeah! Yeah!
