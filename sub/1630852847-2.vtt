to welcome you all to our home.

00:18.018 --> 00:19.227
- What type of party is this?

00:19.269 --> 00:20.437
- Oh, it's a fundraiser
for your Uncle Phil.

00:20.478 --> 00:22.147

How you been, bro?

00:26.109 --> 00:28.111
- Hey, Lise.
So you met my cousin.

00:28.153 --> 00:29.738
- Yeah.

00:29.779 --> 00:32.282
- "Haute Cuisine" is the top
food magazine in the country,

00:32.323 --> 00:33.575
and I have a interview
with them next week.

00:33.616 --> 00:35.035

what happened.

I also know that your
fingerprints were found

00:42.375 --> 00:44.002
on an unregistered Glock.
- Better use it.

00:44.044 --> 00:46.254
- You'd still be sitting in a
jail cell if it wasn't for me.

00:46.296 --> 00:48.715
- Rashad wants you dead, bro.
I think I'm next.

00:48.757 --> 00:50.467
- Mom and Dad said that
you were out here

00:50.508 --> 00:52.302
for a better education?

00:52.344 --> 00:54.471

you know Carlton

00:54.512 --> 00:56.222
and what he's been through.

Relax, Lise.
He's okay, all right?

01:09.152 --> 01:10.278
He's just doing this

that happened and he knows it.

01:25.168 --> 01:26.544
I was defendin' myself.

01:26.586 --> 01:28.755
- You had him flat on his back
and you didn't stop.

01:28.797 --> 01:30.799
- That's 'cause
he's a goddamn thug.

01:30.840 --> 01:32.217
- Watch your mouth.

01:32.258 --> 01:33.635
You're not innocent.
He could've drowned.

01:33.677 --> 01:35.136

Lisa.

01:36.554 --> 01:37.722

Got it.
- He was crowding her.

01:43.353 --> 01:44.270
- We were just talkin',
you idiot.

01:44.312 --> 01:45.730
- You know what? Stop it.

01:45.772 --> 01:48.733
Both of you get out of my face
and go to your rooms now.

01:51.194 --> 01:52.737
Now.

01:58.410 --> 02:00.161
I was talking to you too.

02:00.203 --> 02:01.579
- Why are you taking his side?

02:03.832 --> 02:07.502
- I know why he acted
the way he did.

with Connor's mother?

02:28.481 --> 02:31.443
- Well, she promised not
to press charges against Will

02:31.484 --> 02:33.278
if we invested in a hedge fund
she manages.

02:33.319 --> 02:35.488
- She's always hustlin'.

02:35.530 --> 02:36.865
Well, how'd you tell her
to go to hell?

02:36.906 --> 02:38.408
- Well, I pointed out
that she and her husband

02:38.450 --> 02:40.160
allowed a bunch
of underage kids to throw

02:40.201 --> 02:42.912
a drug and alcohol-fueled party
on property they own.

02:42.954 --> 02:46.041
- I'm glad at least one of us
got to enjoy ourselves tonight.

02:46.082 --> 02:48.293
- Mm.

02:48.335 --> 02:49.794
Only to a point.

02:51.838 --> 02:55.175
I can't tolerate
anymore of this, Viv.

02:55.216 --> 02:58.345
I mean, first, it's a gun,
and now Carlton's hurt.

02:58.386 --> 03:00.889
And now that video
of the fight is out there.

03:00.930 --> 03:04.934
It's bound to affect
my campaign.

03:04.976 --> 03:07.562
- This is our campaign.

03:07.604 --> 03:09.856
We all signed up for this.

03:09.898 --> 03:11.691
- You're right.

03:11.733 --> 03:14.527
And to that point, Carlton does
share some of the blame tonight.

03:16.404 --> 03:18.782
But maybe Will just isn't
cut out for Bel-Air.

03:18.823 --> 03:21.451
- You know he can't go back
to Philly right now.

03:21.493 --> 03:23.995
And there's no one else
to take him in.

03:24.037 --> 03:26.581
- There's boarding schools,
military academies.

03:26.623 --> 03:28.208
- Oh, come on, Phil.

03:28.249 --> 03:30.919
We cannot just throw our hands
up in the air like this.

03:30.960 --> 03:33.380

to keep him safe

03:33.421 --> 03:35.090
knowing it would be difficult.

03:35.131 --> 03:37.050
- But it seems impossible, Viv.

03:37.092 --> 03:38.510
I mean, why we workin' so hard
to save a boy

03:38.551 --> 03:39.678
who doesn't want to be saved?

03:39.719 --> 03:42.305
- Because we owe it to him.

03:43.723 --> 03:46.559
- That doesn't mean we can right
every wrong in his life.

03:46.601 --> 03:48.019
Not to the detriment
of our family.

03:48.061 --> 03:49.646

03:49.688 --> 03:53.274
And I just know in my heart

03:53.316 --> 03:56.528
that he is not a lost cause.

03:56.569 --> 03:59.406
- That may be true.

03:59.447 --> 04:02.075
But I'm not sure
we're the answer he needs.

04:02.117 --> 04:03.785
- Then I'll talk to him then.

04:06.413 --> 04:09.457
- We will talk to him.

04:09.499 --> 04:11.793

04:11.835 --> 04:15.213
in a way that makes us

did they offer?

Yeah, I don't know.

Look around.

16:11.346 --> 16:13.473
These are my people.

16:25.694 --> 16:27.153
- So I became a lawyer because

16:27.195 --> 16:29.572
growing up on a farm
in Yamacraw, North Carolina,

16:29.614 --> 16:31.491
I saw the law used
to take advantage of people

16:31.533 --> 16:34.327
who didn't fully understand it.

16:34.369 --> 16:36.913
My parents lost most of their
farmland to eminent domain

16:36.955 --> 16:40.125
because they didn't know
how to fight it.

16:40.166 --> 16:42.460
Once I got my law degree,

16:42.502 --> 16:45.422
one of my first court cases
was in Yamacraw.

16:45.463 --> 16:47.173
I got my parents' money
for the land

16:47.215 --> 16:48.425
that was taken
when I was a boy.

16:48.466 --> 16:50.093
- Man, I love that.

16:50.135 --> 16:52.762
You know, you're a good son,
man, and I love the fact

16:52.804 --> 16:55.140
that you were able
to get your parents paid.

16:55.181 --> 16:56.975
And also, when we were
going through your bio,

16:57.017 --> 16:58.768
I see that you did win
some, like,

16:58.810 --> 17:01.896
huge class action cases against
slumlords in Los Angeles.

17:01.938 --> 17:04.024
- Yeah, yeah, my firm and I
were able to win millions

17:04.065 --> 17:06.067
of dollars in compensation
for our clients.

17:06.109 --> 17:07.944
- And you kept a few million
for yourself

17:07.986 --> 17:10.071
I--I imagine, right?

17:10.113 --> 17:11.948
- Well, I am financially secure.

17:11.990 --> 17:13.908
- Financially secure?
That means rich.

17:13.950 --> 17:15.201
- I'm not as rich
as my opponent

17:15.243 --> 17:16.411
would have you believe.

17:16.453 --> 17:17.412

as Billionaire Banks,

17:17.454 --> 17:18.955
which isn't accurate.

were able to clear that up.

17:20.832 --> 17:23.043
Now you are
the only Black candidate

17:23.084 --> 17:24.794

this unique responsibility

Matter of fact, man, just
let me show you my highlight--

- Nah, I've already been privy
to your highlight reel, kid--

19:02.475 --> 19:03.977
that fight you got in
this weekend.

19:06.187 --> 19:08.273

19:08.314 --> 19:09.899
- Yeah, look.

19:09.941 --> 19:12.193
I'm not clear on what brings
a D-1 recruit from Philadelphia

all the way to Los Angeles

19:13.778 --> 19:15.155

I have no interest
in entertaining the drama

19:25.165 --> 19:27.917
What's this going to take
to change your mind?

who wants to be part of a team.

20:06.373 --> 20:07.665
- What, are you mad at me
too now?

20:07.707 --> 20:08.917
- I'm not mad at you.

20:08.958 --> 20:10.752
It's just when I broke up
with Carlton,

20:10.794 --> 20:12.879
it's all anyone could
talk about for months.

20:12.921 --> 20:14.381
He was their heartbroken hero,

20:14.422 --> 20:15.799
and I was
the cold-hearted bitch.

20:15.840 --> 20:18.134
I'm not trying to be
in the sequel.

20:18.176 --> 20:20.345
- I get that, but Carlton's been
out here telling people

20:20.387 --> 20:22.389
that he accidentally
knocked me in the pool,

20:22.430 --> 20:24.057
and I just got out
and went ham.

20:24.099 --> 20:25.308
- Yeah, I know.

20:25.350 --> 20:27.143
- A'ight, so help me
tell people the truth.

20:27.185 --> 20:28.436
- And have everyone think

20:28.478 --> 20:30.772
that I caused the fight
between you and Carlton?

20:30.814 --> 20:34.025
- I mean, you are the reason
he pushed me in the pool.

20:34.067 --> 20:36.820
But you're also the reason why
I didn't drown,

20:36.861 --> 20:39.322
so thanks for that.

20:39.364 --> 20:40.657
- You're welcome.

20:40.699 --> 20:42.867
You know, you ought
to learn to swim, right?

20:42.909 --> 20:44.411
- Can you teach me how to swim?
- [laughs]

20:44.452 --> 20:45.870
I don't mess with beginners.

20:45.912 --> 20:48.665
- [laughs] Oh!
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

20:48.707 --> 20:51.001
So are you going to help me,
or not?

20:51.042 --> 20:53.253
- Even if I did, I'm not
even sure it would work.

20:53.294 --> 20:56.131
Carlton's word is like gospel
to these sheep.

20:56.172 --> 20:59.592
- Tch.
That's what I'm saying.

20:59.634 --> 21:01.594
Yo, how is it possible
that Carlton

21:01.636 --> 21:03.847
is the coolest brother
in this jawn?

21:03.888 --> 21:05.306
Being the captain
of the lacrosse team

21:05.348 --> 21:07.183
and junior class president
wouldn't even

21:07.225 --> 21:09.644
come close to making you
a top dog in Philly.

21:09.686 --> 21:10.937
- There's more to it.

21:10.979 --> 21:13.314
Carlton's charming
when he wants to be.

21:13.356 --> 21:15.692
He remembers everyone's name
and birthday

21:15.734 --> 21:17.694
and he knows how to make
a person feel special.

21:17.736 --> 21:18.903
- So that's how he got you?

21:18.945 --> 21:20.655
- Goodbye, Will.
- Yo, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

21:20.697 --> 21:24.993
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I just be
sayin' shit to try and be funny.

21:25.035 --> 21:27.412
See, I'm not a thug.
I'm a smartass.

21:27.454 --> 21:29.039
- [chuckles]
[bell rings]

21:29.080 --> 21:32.208
I can't be late to French.
Madame Simmons goes nuts.

21:32.250 --> 21:34.377
- A'ight, I guess
it's au revoir then.

22:07.827 --> 22:10.830
- Thank you guys so much
for this opportunity.

22:10.872 --> 22:12.082
I hope you enjoyed the food

22:12.123 --> 22:13.416
as much as I enjoyed
preparing it.

22:13.458 --> 22:15.919
- I must say, Hilary,
we are quite impressed.

22:15.960 --> 22:18.004
- Absolutely. Bravo.

22:18.046 --> 22:20.423
- I would never have thought
something so down market

22:20.465 --> 22:22.258
would be so amazing.

22:22.300 --> 22:25.887
- Thank you.
So did I get the job?

22:25.929 --> 22:28.098
- You've certainly given us
a lot to consider.

22:28.139 --> 22:30.975
Before we would move forward
with any kind of an offer,

22:31.017 --> 22:34.813
I need to be sure that you're
okay with our requirements.

22:34.854 --> 22:37.065
- Lay 'em on me.

22:37.107 --> 22:39.734
- We would wanna weigh in
on your wardrobe.

22:39.776 --> 22:43.446
We prefer more classic,
neutral colors.

22:43.488 --> 22:46.950
- Not that what you're wearing
isn't beautiful.

22:46.991 --> 22:48.284
- We just don't want the clothes

22:48.326 --> 22:52.288
to be more eye-grabbing
than the food.

22:52.330 --> 22:54.290
- Okay.
- Before you post anything,

22:54.332 --> 22:57.002
you'd have to submit
all your recipes for review.

22:57.043 --> 22:58.336
- And just a heads up,

22:58.378 --> 23:02.465
the food you prepared today
was a bit spicy.

23:02.507 --> 23:06.136
We definitely want you to,
you know, tone it down.

23:06.177 --> 23:08.388
- But that's what people love
about my cooking.

23:08.430 --> 23:10.515
I mean, my family
was just complimenting

23:10.557 --> 23:12.934
my spice mix this morning.

23:12.976 --> 23:14.310
- All due respect,

23:14.352 --> 23:18.606
I don't think your family
is our target audience.

23:18.648 --> 23:21.317

23:30.577 --> 23:32.120
- Welcome to Algebra II, Will.

23:32.162 --> 23:34.789
It's your first day so feel
free to sit this quiz out.

23:34.831 --> 23:36.833
- Oh, no, actually,
I'm down, Mr. Clark.

23:36.875 --> 23:38.418
I can do the work
like everybody else.

23:38.460 --> 23:41.838
- How refreshing, a student
who wants to do the work.

23:41.880 --> 23:43.882
Good luck.

23:43.923 --> 23:46.593
Late again, Tyler.

23:46.634 --> 23:49.346
- Actually, Mr. Clark,
I can't be late, right?

23:49.387 --> 23:52.098
'Cause time is just
an arbitrary social construct

23:52.140 --> 23:54.059
used primarily
in the capitalist system

23:54.100 --> 23:56.311
to maximize
the exploitation of laborers--

23:56.353 --> 23:59.898
- All right, forget it.
Just take the quiz, huh?

23:59.939 --> 24:01.399
- You got it.

24:05.987 --> 24:08.198
- [whispers] Nice going.
- [whispers] Thanks.

24:08.239 --> 24:09.949
Yeah, the trick is
to be too annoying to punish.

24:09.991 --> 24:12.035
- Oh, got you.
[chuckles]

24:12.077 --> 24:14.037
Hey, I'm Will, by the way.
- Tyler.

24:14.079 --> 24:16.498
And it's an honor to meet you.

24:16.539 --> 24:18.625
I've wanted to punch Connor
since like the sixth grade.

- Hang on.

24:25.799 --> 24:27.717
Hey.

24:27.759 --> 24:29.511
Hey, I'm talking to you.

24:32.472 --> 24:34.057
- What?

24:36.601 --> 24:37.977
What is this?

24:38.019 --> 24:39.604
- It says you have to stay
at least 10 feet away

24:39.646 --> 24:40.730
from me on school grounds

24:40.772 --> 24:43.566
and at least 50 feet
anywhere else.

24:43.608 --> 24:45.902
Everyone's a witness.

24:47.445 --> 24:51.491
My uncle is a federal judge,
so from now on, steer clear.

24:56.204 --> 24:59.416
- A'ight, bro, I get it.
It's your school, your domain.

24:59.457 --> 25:01.960
Look, I'm sorry I hit you.
I apologize.

25:02.002 --> 25:03.169
- Nah, see,
it's too late for that.

25:03.211 --> 25:04.295
Lisa's been running her mouth

25:04.337 --> 25:05.714
telling everyone
that I attacked you

25:05.755 --> 25:07.799
because I got jealous
when I saw you talking to her.

25:07.841 --> 25:09.968
- Because that's what happened,
Carlton.

25:10.010 --> 25:11.428
How hard did you hit your head?

25:11.469 --> 25:12.846
- This whole thing
could have died down,

25:12.887 --> 25:14.681
but now you and Lisa
made me look weak.

25:14.723 --> 25:16.433
So we need to fight.
You and me.

25:16.474 --> 25:18.268
Right here, right now.

25:18.309 --> 25:20.145
Let everyone see how
a fair fight would turn out.

25:20.186 --> 25:21.855
- Look, see,
I'm not about to fight you--

25:21.896 --> 25:23.815
- You scared to fight me
when I'm not half-drunk?

25:23.857 --> 25:25.483
- I ain't scared to do shit.

25:25.525 --> 25:27.152
And unless you want me
to bust you upside

25:27.193 --> 25:29.487

I suggest you back the fuck up.

25:29.529 --> 25:31.865
- Or what? Hmm?

- If I lose, I lose.

25:40.582 --> 25:43.960
And if I win, I lose.

25:44.002 --> 25:46.296
You know what?
You got it.

26:00.852 --> 26:02.687
- They made an offer.

26:02.729 --> 26:04.522
So tell me why
we're not celebrating

26:04.564 --> 26:06.066
you having a paying job?

26:06.107 --> 26:08.818
- Because, Mom, I'm not sure
about some of the requirements

26:08.860 --> 26:10.236
they were asking for of me.

26:10.278 --> 26:12.530
- It's a position
at "Haute Cuisine."

26:12.572 --> 26:13.990
Is this not what you've been
building towards?

26:14.032 --> 26:15.492
- What I've been
building towards?

26:15.533 --> 26:17.744
Or what you been
building towards?

26:17.786 --> 26:19.954
- You asked me for help,
so I called in a favor

26:19.996 --> 26:22.540
to get you this interview.

26:22.582 --> 26:25.293
If you get this job,
it'll put you on the map

26:25.335 --> 26:28.505
as the top culinary
influencer, Hilary.

26:28.546 --> 26:30.131
- Okay, fine.

26:30.173 --> 26:31.424
But if I'm gonna build
towards something,

26:31.466 --> 26:33.134
I want to build
on my own terms.

26:33.176 --> 26:35.303
- Honey, I know how you feel,

26:35.345 --> 26:38.848
but this is how professional
opportunities work.

26:38.890 --> 26:42.477
An agreement is made
between you and an employer.

26:42.519 --> 26:44.646
As an artist,
going into a collaboration,

26:44.688 --> 26:46.481
you're bound to have
to give up some things.

26:46.523 --> 26:48.525
- Like your soul.
- Ashley, please.

26:48.566 --> 26:49.693
- No, she's right.

26:49.734 --> 26:52.654
I mean, that's how
it's starting to feel.

26:52.696 --> 26:56.199
I mean, they want me to tone
down my signature recipe

26:56.241 --> 26:59.536
because it's too dynamic
for their core audience.

26:59.577 --> 27:01.663
- By core audience,
they mean white people, right?

27:01.705 --> 27:02.997
- Yes.

27:03.039 --> 27:05.250
- So push back and negotiate.

27:05.291 --> 27:06.501
Nobody gets through life

27:06.543 --> 27:08.253
without having
to compromise a little.

27:08.294 --> 27:10.964
- Right, like deciding to be
an art history teacher

27:11.006 --> 27:13.550
instead of actually
being an artist.

27:17.679 --> 27:19.681

on the court.

playin' basketball in Philly.

30:34.376 --> 30:36.544
- Good,
because I didn't send my boy

30:36.586 --> 30:38.546
across the country
to be picked on.

30:38.588 --> 30:40.131
- Picked on?

30:40.173 --> 30:42.467
For what it's worth, Will won
that fistfight hands down.

30:42.509 --> 30:44.135
- You know--damn it.

30:44.177 --> 30:46.346
You swore to me that you would
look after Will.

30:46.388 --> 30:48.515
- I am.

30:48.556 --> 30:49.516
- You know,
I would bring him home now

30:49.557 --> 30:50.725
if Tray hadn't got shot,

30:50.767 --> 30:54.187
but it's still dangerous
in these streets.

[soft dramatic music]

30:57.857 --> 30:59.776
- Will probably
has to stay with you

30:59.818 --> 31:03.780
until Christmas break, at least.

31:03.822 --> 31:06.700
I'll be sending his stuff
out to him

31:06.741 --> 31:08.368
if that's okay
with you and Phil

31:08.410 --> 31:10.954
after what happened.

31:10.995 --> 31:14.499
- Vy, we can handle this.
Please.

Let me do this for him.

[A Tribe Called Quest's

- Nah.

31:44.112 --> 31:46.364
That was a great night.

31:55.999 --> 31:57.917
- So, Geoffrey, what are we
gonna do about Will?

31:57.959 --> 32:00.211
- Give him some real time
to adjust.

32:03.048 --> 32:04.466

It was a big culture shock
for me

32:05.884 --> 32:09.054
when I left Jamaica for London
as a boy, you know.

32:09.095 --> 32:11.389
What I'm saying is,
Will needs more than a few days

32:11.431 --> 32:13.892
to find his footing
around here.

32:13.933 --> 32:15.477
- I fear the more time
we give him,

32:15.518 --> 32:17.771
the more trouble
he's gonna cause--

32:17.812 --> 32:20.690
for himself and this family.

It wasn't the plan
initially though.

I put this up for Carlton,

- Humor me.

- No.
No, I can't say that I have.

33:34.055 --> 33:37.767
- It's like a movie

to go through that.

Like, I didn't fight back,
I didn't resist,

- I know.

34:08.882 --> 34:10.800
I know. It's tragic.

34:10.842 --> 34:12.385
It's proof how broken
the system is.

34:12.427 --> 34:15.722
- See, that's the thing.
To me, the system isn't broken.

34:15.764 --> 34:16.890
To me, the system
is doing exactly

34:16.931 --> 34:18.391
what it was designed to do.

34:18.433 --> 34:20.060
- I hear that.

34:20.101 --> 34:24.064
But from where I stand,
things have gotten better.

Incrementally.

Look how you live.

supposed to do?

should give up.

- Never.

- Don't start now.

34:50.799 --> 34:52.801
The easiest way
to get back in the game

is when we can get out
of our own heads.

He doesn't deserve your wrath

from that asshole.

you need to get away from Connor

in the gym though.

for the team.

38:27.140 --> 38:28.600
Nah, but tell me something.

38:28.641 --> 38:30.435
Is this tryout just another
setup for me to get played,

38:30.477 --> 38:32.103
or do you think
I really have a shot?

38:32.145 --> 38:33.438

a straight shooter.

a spot, you can earn it.

So I was talking to someone
the other day

39:10.892 --> 39:13.061

that relationship.

39:24.781 --> 39:25.949
Okay, so look.

39:25.990 --> 39:27.701
I was offered
a high-profile job,

39:27.742 --> 39:29.869
and I turned it down
because they were trying

39:29.911 --> 39:32.664
to make me change my recipes.

39:34.249 --> 39:36.126
Um, I'm perfectly sane, okay?

39:36.167 --> 39:38.169

is irrelevant.

39:38.211 --> 39:41.006
Okay, so look, here's the deal.

39:41.047 --> 39:43.049
I feel like
I can't be successful

39:43.091 --> 39:44.634
if somebody's trying
to change me,

39:44.676 --> 39:45.969

they are my culture.

I mean, some of the food
that I showed y'all

39:50.306 --> 39:51.850
was passed down
from my grandmother,

39:51.891 --> 39:54.894
and I'm not watering down
a recipe so Becky in Ohio

39:54.936 --> 39:57.814
can feel more comfortable.

39:57.856 --> 40:01.526
Oh, and also, they told me
that my ethnic family

40:01.568 --> 40:04.529
was not their target audience,
