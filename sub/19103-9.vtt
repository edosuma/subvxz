All right, Chuck, we're gonna

00:03.346 --> 00:04.979

00:04.981 --> 00:06.414
Now, as you know,

00:06.416 --> 00:08.148
the camera is gonna be the point of view

00:08.151 --> 00:10.084
of the little Husky Boy shopper,

00:10.086 --> 00:11.630
so we open on:

00:11.655 --> 00:13.667
he enters the store.

00:13.713 --> 00:16.306
The camera pans up. He looks to Mom.

00:16.332 --> 00:17.815
It comes back down.

00:17.817 --> 00:19.983
We see a bunch of fat
little boys in suits.

00:19.985 --> 00:21.585
- Husky boys.
- I'm sorry?

00:21.587 --> 00:23.320
We don't call 'em
fat. We call 'em husky.

00:23.322 --> 00:26.023
Oh. Okay, sure.

00:26.025 --> 00:27.391
Then we see some tennis outfits

00:27.393 --> 00:29.368
being worn by a couple real chunkers.

00:29.393 --> 00:30.696
- Husky boys.
- I'm sorry?

00:30.721 --> 00:32.087
Again, we call 'em husky boys.

00:32.110 --> 00:33.810
Oh, you're not just objecting to "fat."

00:33.813 --> 00:35.079
You don't like any of the terms.

00:35.080 --> 00:37.013
Oh, we just prefer to use "husky."

00:37.015 --> 00:38.448
Got it. Okay.

00:38.451 --> 00:39.750
To bring it all home,

00:39.752 --> 00:41.886
we feature your soon-to-be-famous

00:41.888 --> 00:43.721

00:43.723 --> 00:46.690

blue-ribbon butterball.

00:46.692 --> 00:48.692
I apologize. That is
what's written down there.

00:48.694 --> 00:50.628
I am sorry about that. Husky boy.

00:51.213 --> 00:52.730
Being worn by a husky boy.

00:52.732 --> 00:55.566
- It's not as good.
- No, it definitely isn't.

00:55.567 --> 00:57.867
Then in our dramatic conclusion,

00:57.870 --> 00:59.536
we see two chubby little hands...

00:59.538 --> 01:01.438
- Husky.
- Even the hands?

01:01.440 --> 01:03.173
- Everything.
- All right.

01:03.175 --> 01:06.911
- Uh, we see two husky hands...
- Ugh!

01:06.913 --> 01:09.580
- Not covered in chocolate.
- That kills me.

01:09.581 --> 01:12.282
They reach down, pick up
a pair of Husky Boy jeans.

01:12.284 --> 01:13.616
Stretch this out a little bit.

01:13.618 --> 01:14.751
Yeah, stretch it out a little bit.

01:14.754 --> 01:16.287

- Nice. Yeah.
- Thank you.

you know, to bring it all home?

01:25.563 --> 01:27.463

- Sure does, Sam.

one yet. I apologize.

01:39.611 --> 01:42.011

No.

01:44.950 --> 01:47.150
I'm sure you'll come up with something.

01:47.153 --> 01:48.819
- Oh, definitely.
- You know, I don't know

01:48.821 --> 01:50.120
if I ever told you this,

01:50.122 --> 01:51.822
but I actually worked with your father

01:51.824 --> 01:53.991
when I was at Hudson's Department Store.

01:53.993 --> 01:55.993
I was actually at the meeting when,

01:56.632 --> 01:58.861
you know, he went nuts.

01:58.863 --> 02:00.129
I prefer "bonkers."

02:00.131 --> 02:02.131
Oh. Of course. Bonkers.

02:02.134 --> 02:03.801
- Thank you.
- Yeah, he came in

02:03.803 --> 02:06.070
to pitch an ad for our
back to school sale,

02:06.463 --> 02:10.007
and he had us close our
eyes, and when we opened them,

02:10.008 --> 02:11.342
he had pulled out this briefcase.

02:11.344 --> 02:12.543
Swear to God,

02:12.545 --> 02:15.312
it was filled to the brim with shit.

02:15.911 --> 02:17.480
And he walked around the table

02:17.483 --> 02:20.718
and put a little handful
in front of each of us.

02:20.720 --> 02:22.686
As he made his way up the table,

02:22.688 --> 02:26.190
I realized he only had
the front half of his suit.

02:26.192 --> 02:28.025
He had cut out the rest.

02:28.557 --> 02:30.026
Totally naked in the back.

02:30.767 --> 02:32.295
I found that to be odd.

02:32.762 --> 02:34.865
So there we were, sitting there,

him to bring it all home.

18:56.705 --> 18:59.170
Husky Jeans, skinny prices.

18:59.171 --> 19:01.338
Yup, I mean, that's it.

19:01.340 --> 19:02.230
Thanks, Dad.

19:02.269 --> 19:03.473
I'll send you a bill.

19:03.475 --> 19:05.308
See you in the funny pages.

19:06.879 --> 19:08.124
You okay?

19:08.247 --> 19:09.289
Yeah.

19:09.414 --> 19:11.377
It was actually a great day.

19:12.551 --> 19:15.933
It's like we were spending time
with the best version of my dad.

19:16.789 --> 19:20.585
There was no anger,
fits of rage, paranoia.

19:20.893 --> 19:22.559
- Hey, hey, hey, hey!
- Fecal hoarding.

19:22.561 --> 19:24.427
Hank! Hey, Hank! Come on! Come on, Hank!

19:24.429 --> 19:26.924
Maybe he is actually getting better.

19:27.942 --> 19:29.332
I'm gonna talk to doctors this week,

19:29.334 --> 19:30.844
see if he can get out.

19:31.370 --> 19:32.936
He could maybe even come and help us out

19:32.938 --> 19:34.272
a few times a week in the office.

19:34.297 --> 19:35.939
- That'd be great.
- It'd be awesome.

19:35.941 --> 19:37.641
Hey, can I buy you breakfast?

19:37.643 --> 19:39.576
No, you can't, 'cause
I'm buying you breakfast.

19:39.578 --> 19:41.144
Don't do that, Tim.

19:41.146 --> 19:42.846
You know, when you don't
let me pay for stuff,

19:42.848 --> 19:44.714
it's like your way of controlling me.

19:44.716 --> 19:46.550
Controlling you? I'm being nice.

19:46.552 --> 19:48.385
- Yeah, right.
- [Hank laughing]

19:48.387 --> 19:50.554
How's buying you breakfast not nice?

19:50.556 --> 19:52.589
- Don't do this, man!
- Tim, it's systemic racism.

19:52.591 --> 19:54.858
We're fat, man! Come on, slow down.
