WEBVTT

00:01.769 --> 00:03.437
- He seems very attached.

00:03.471 --> 00:05.106
- I've become quite fond
of him.

00:05.139 --> 00:07.575
[clock ticking]

00:07.608 --> 00:10.311
- I have heard no end
of complaints about this woman

00:10.344 --> 00:12.546
and her investigative methods.

00:12.580 --> 00:16.717
- She stood right in front of
me and I didn't even see her.

00:16.750 --> 00:19.487
You said she was involved
with the Dusters with Goo Goo.

00:19.520 --> 00:21.655
- You know I'd do anything
for you.

00:21.689 --> 00:23.591
- I don't want any baby.

00:23.624 --> 00:27.161
- [cries]
- I want my baby.

00:27.195 --> 00:30.131
- It's Sara.
She's found Libby Hatch.

00:30.164 --> 00:31.599
She's following her.

00:31.632 --> 00:33.267
- Drop the gun.

00:33.867 --> 00:35.103
- Sara!

00:35.803 --> 00:37.138
- Libby.

00:37.938 --> 00:38.972
- Libby's gone.

00:39.006 --> 00:41.342
[dramatic music]

00:41.375 --> 00:43.477
- You were brave today.

00:43.511 --> 00:46.680
*

00:52.220 --> 00:55.489
[sparse dramatic music]

00:55.523 --> 01:02.563
*

01:32.526 --> 01:33.761
- Sara.

01:46.340 --> 01:50.244
In my mind, it was easy enough
to tell you how I felt,

01:50.278 --> 01:54.248
what this has meant, but...

01:54.282 --> 01:57.451
but words fail me.

01:58.419 --> 02:02.590
All I want
is to be worthy of you, Sara.

02:02.623 --> 02:05.793
- You are engaged
to be married, John.

02:07.195 --> 02:10.130
It's just not that simple.

02:11.131 --> 02:13.000
- It could be.

02:13.033 --> 02:18.439
*

02:18.472 --> 02:21.609
[sparse ominous music]

02:21.642 --> 02:28.716
*

02:51.939 --> 02:53.607
- [groans softly]

02:53.641 --> 02:55.376
- Hey, lady.
What the hell are you doing?

02:55.409 --> 02:57.245
That's for the horses.

02:57.278 --> 02:58.646
*

02:58.679 --> 03:00.648
- I lost my baby.

03:00.681 --> 03:02.149
- Well, she ain't in there,
lady.

03:02.182 --> 03:05.286
- She was stolen from me!

03:05.319 --> 03:10.491
*

03:10.524 --> 03:12.826
- Come on.
[clicks tongue] Come on.

03:12.860 --> 03:15.829
[dark music]

03:15.863 --> 03:22.703
*

03:45.326 --> 03:48.429
[indistinct chatter]

03:48.462 --> 03:51.699
[soft dramatic music]

03:51.732 --> 03:58.572
*

04:05.145 --> 04:06.447
- There.

04:06.480 --> 04:09.883
*

04:09.917 --> 04:13.053
[winch clicking]

04:13.086 --> 04:20.328
*

04:31.772 --> 04:35.409
[oohs and ahhs]

04:35.443 --> 04:39.647
[gasps and applause]

04:39.680 --> 04:42.850
[dramatic ambient music]

04:42.883 --> 04:49.923
*

05:18.719 --> 05:22.956
- He was more interested
in going on capers with her

05:22.990 --> 05:26.126
than with spending any time
at all with me.

05:26.159 --> 05:27.260
It's only getting worse.

05:27.294 --> 05:30.330
- Violet, please.
Sit.

05:35.769 --> 05:37.805
Whatever my issues
with Mr. Moore,

05:37.838 --> 05:40.307
I know that he cares deeply
for you,

05:40.340 --> 05:42.776
that he loves you.

05:42.810 --> 05:44.044
And remember,

05:44.077 --> 05:46.814
it is you who is to become
Mrs. John Schuyler Moore,

05:46.847 --> 05:48.649
not Miss Howard.

05:48.682 --> 05:51.885
- Have you seen how he gazes
at her?

05:51.919 --> 05:55.489
How he leaps out of his chair
when she enters a room?

05:55.523 --> 06:00.327
How he laughs and hangs
on her every word?

06:00.360 --> 06:04.432
It's so unbecoming.

06:04.465 --> 06:08.502
Why does he endlessly consort
with her?

06:08.536 --> 06:11.004
Will she be as my mother was
to you?

06:12.272 --> 06:17.277
Papa, I understand the ways
of men of your standing,

06:17.310 --> 06:21.949
but John and I haven't even
begun a life together.

06:21.982 --> 06:25.352
- I promise you I will bring
Mr. Moore to heel.

06:25.385 --> 06:28.188
I will not let you suffer.

06:28.221 --> 06:31.091
- As your wife has?

06:31.124 --> 06:34.027
And my mother has?

06:34.061 --> 06:35.763
Sometimes,

06:35.796 --> 06:39.967
it's as though the whole of
New York whispers as I pass by.

06:40.000 --> 06:45.005
"There goes that poor,
unwanted, misbegotten thing."

06:45.038 --> 06:48.341
- Oh, Violet.
My girl.

06:48.375 --> 06:50.644
You are so dear to me.

06:50.678 --> 06:53.847
[soft dramatic music]

06:53.881 --> 06:55.382
*

06:55.415 --> 06:57.317
If their friendship
is painful to you,

06:57.350 --> 06:59.052
then I will put a swift end
to it.

06:59.086 --> 07:03.056
And you might be pleased
to know that, uh,

07:03.090 --> 07:05.693
Miss Howard's unusual lifestyle

07:05.726 --> 07:10.397
has brought about some
unflattering publicity.

07:10.430 --> 07:13.634
*

07:13.667 --> 07:15.903
And will continue to do so.

07:15.936 --> 07:22.743
*

07:22.776 --> 07:25.245
- I've been thinking.

07:25.278 --> 07:27.748
- Yes?

07:27.781 --> 07:31.318
- Where did Libby
keep the babies?

07:31.351 --> 07:32.419
- What?

07:32.452 --> 07:33.420
- Think about it.

07:33.453 --> 07:34.722
She worked as a nurse,

07:34.755 --> 07:35.723
she didn't bring them
to the hospital,

07:35.756 --> 07:37.424
so where were they?

07:37.457 --> 07:40.060
- I don't know.
Sara--

07:40.093 --> 07:42.195
- There were no diapers
in that room, no bottles,

07:42.229 --> 07:45.265
no infant food, nowhere
for the baby to sleep.

07:45.298 --> 07:46.900
It was not set up as a nursery.

07:46.934 --> 07:49.269
- She must've kept them
elsewhere,

07:49.302 --> 07:51.438
somewhere we have yet
to uncover.

07:51.471 --> 07:53.373
- This is not over, John.

07:53.406 --> 07:55.709
[knock at door]

07:55.743 --> 07:57.711
- Violet has a key,
but she wouldn't just--

07:57.745 --> 07:59.580
[knock at door]

07:59.613 --> 08:02.883
- [strong New York accent]
Open up, Mr. Moore!

08:04.952 --> 08:05.919
- Bitsy, please.

08:05.953 --> 08:07.621
Will you have a little decency

08:07.655 --> 08:08.956
and not pound on my door
first thing in the morning

08:08.989 --> 08:11.224
like some
persistent woodpecker!

08:11.258 --> 08:14.094
- I don't think Miss Sara
will be too pleased with this.

08:25.673 --> 08:27.775
- What is it?

08:27.808 --> 08:29.577
- I'm sorry, Sara.

08:29.610 --> 08:32.179
Hearst's rag.

08:36.584 --> 08:39.152
- He's making this personal.

08:39.186 --> 08:42.322
Byrnes had a hand in that.
- I would not be surprised.

08:42.355 --> 08:45.726
It does, however, mention that
you found the Linares child.

08:45.759 --> 08:48.562
Even Hearst can't
take that away from you.

08:48.596 --> 08:50.831
- But the result
is quite the opposite.

08:50.864 --> 08:52.833
We've been taking calls
since 8:00 this morning.

08:52.866 --> 08:54.835
- Calls?
- For new cases.

08:54.868 --> 08:57.437
Seeing if you're available
to take on work.

08:57.470 --> 08:58.972
We need you at the office,
Sara.

08:59.006 --> 09:00.741
- We're not done
with Libby Hatch.

09:00.774 --> 09:02.109
We've missed something.

09:02.142 --> 09:05.178
- You found the Linares baby.
The job's done.

09:05.212 --> 09:08.348
- She slipped through
my fingers, Bitsy.

09:08.381 --> 09:09.817
If she strikes again,

09:09.850 --> 09:12.853
I'll never be able
to shed the guilt.

09:12.886 --> 09:16.423
[foreboding music]

09:16.456 --> 09:18.592
[knock at door]

09:18.626 --> 09:25.866
*

09:28.068 --> 09:31.138
- That's the best I can do,
Libby.

09:31.171 --> 09:34.708
You don't need no doctor.
[chuckles]

09:34.742 --> 09:39.046
*

09:39.079 --> 09:43.383
If you want, we can go out.
Do something fun.

09:43.416 --> 09:45.052
- No.

09:45.085 --> 09:48.055
*

09:48.088 --> 09:50.057
- [sighs]

09:50.090 --> 09:54.962
You're just missing
the little one, ain't you?

09:54.995 --> 09:58.065
[sighs]

09:58.098 --> 10:00.801
So maybe we get you
a better one.

10:00.834 --> 10:03.503
The one you was eyeing?

10:03.536 --> 10:05.238
Make you feel better.

10:05.272 --> 10:10.844
*

10:10.878 --> 10:14.114
[indistinct chatter]

10:14.848 --> 10:17.751
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa.

10:33.633 --> 10:36.603
[soft tense music]

10:36.636 --> 10:41.108
*

10:41.141 --> 10:42.843
- Where's Paulie?

10:42.876 --> 10:45.679
*

10:45.713 --> 10:47.147
Paulie?

10:49.149 --> 10:50.117
Paulie!

10:50.150 --> 10:52.619
[tense music]

10:52.652 --> 10:54.621
Stevie!

10:54.654 --> 11:00.694
*

11:00.728 --> 11:02.229
Cut him down.

11:02.262 --> 11:06.466
*

11:06.499 --> 11:08.401
[grunting]

11:08.435 --> 11:10.637
*

11:10.670 --> 11:14.141
Paulie, Paulie, Paulie!

11:14.174 --> 11:16.910
- [wheezing]

11:16.944 --> 11:22.115
- It's me.
- [gasping and coughing]

11:22.149 --> 11:29.122
*

11:33.260 --> 11:37.330
- Of course.
Get the children back inside.

11:37.364 --> 11:40.267
[soft dramatic music]

11:40.300 --> 11:42.736
Your presence is not required,
Captain Doyle.

11:42.770 --> 11:44.171
- Well,

11:44.204 --> 11:46.006
I'd say the circumstances
would suggest otherwise.

11:46.039 --> 11:48.075
- It was an accident,
nothing more.

11:48.108 --> 11:51.144
- Boy hangs himself
in your care?

11:51.178 --> 11:53.646
Now, that's negligence at best.

11:53.680 --> 11:55.949
And at worst, well,

11:55.983 --> 11:57.818
that's for us to uncover.

11:57.851 --> 12:04.892
*

12:05.358 --> 12:07.861
- Crime scene
under active investigation.

12:07.895 --> 12:09.529
- I'm part of that
investigation, officer.

12:09.562 --> 12:12.032
- Oh, I've seen your name
and face in the papers, miss,

12:12.065 --> 12:14.434
but you're not on my list.

12:14.467 --> 12:15.702
- [sighs]

12:19.739 --> 12:21.641
We've checked the whole house.
There's no sign of her.

12:21.674 --> 12:22.843
- Isaacson!

12:22.876 --> 12:24.444
- Is there anything to suggest

12:24.477 --> 12:26.013
that's where she kept
the victims when she was away?

12:26.046 --> 12:27.014
- Isaacson, they're calling
for you upstairs.

12:27.047 --> 12:30.017
- Thank you, officer.

12:30.050 --> 12:32.685
We'll report back later.

12:32.719 --> 12:34.888
[sighs]

12:35.923 --> 12:37.657
- If not here, then where?

12:37.690 --> 12:41.061
She had to have cared
for the babies somewhere.

12:41.094 --> 12:44.131
- Perhaps there is more here
than meets the eye.

12:44.164 --> 12:47.901
After all,
it is owned by Goo Goo Knox.

12:47.935 --> 12:55.208
*

13:04.717 --> 13:05.819
- We should go in.

13:05.853 --> 13:13.093
*

13:50.630 --> 13:53.600
[eerie music]

13:53.633 --> 14:00.840
*

14:49.656 --> 14:51.758
Oh, my God.

14:51.791 --> 14:57.030
*

14:57.064 --> 15:00.033
[baby crying]

15:00.067 --> 15:03.503
She kept them caged.

15:04.404 --> 15:05.538
- Sara.

15:05.572 --> 15:12.345
*

15:12.379 --> 15:14.881
- Are they all dead?
- Yes.

15:14.914 --> 15:15.983
[flash powder bangs]

15:16.016 --> 15:18.685
[babies crying]

15:18.718 --> 15:21.989
- This one is Martha Napp's.

15:22.022 --> 15:24.057
Who are the others?

15:24.091 --> 15:25.993
*

15:26.026 --> 15:27.995
- Other victims, I suppose.

15:28.028 --> 15:30.563
*

15:30.597 --> 15:33.333
And this seems to be set up
for another portrait.

15:33.366 --> 15:36.069
[flash powder bangs
and sizzles]

15:36.103 --> 15:37.837
- For baby Anna.

15:37.870 --> 15:40.507
*

15:40.540 --> 15:43.910
Looks like we found her
just in time.

15:43.943 --> 15:51.184
*

15:57.624 --> 16:02.195
- This belongs to her.
- She stole it from the house.

16:02.229 --> 16:04.197
Meaning the night she broke in
to take the child

16:04.231 --> 16:06.933
was probably not the first time
she'd been there.

16:06.966 --> 16:08.935
*

16:08.968 --> 16:10.537
- [sobbing]

16:10.570 --> 16:12.105
- It's so frightening
to imagine her

16:12.139 --> 16:14.374
in the consulate at night,

16:14.407 --> 16:16.509
like a phantom watching them.

16:16.543 --> 16:18.045
- [screams]

16:18.078 --> 16:20.313
- I'll go get Marcus
and Lucius.

16:28.288 --> 16:30.957
[soft dramatic music]

16:30.990 --> 16:37.697
*

16:37.730 --> 16:41.368
- You had expectations of me,
Paulie.

16:41.401 --> 16:43.870
Fair ones.

16:43.903 --> 16:49.609
*

16:49.642 --> 16:54.781
I got caught up in this case...

16:54.814 --> 17:00.953
a matter of confounding urgency
that...

17:00.987 --> 17:04.124
overtook me, and then...

17:04.157 --> 17:10.297
*

17:10.330 --> 17:13.766
I'm sorry, Paulie.

17:13.800 --> 17:15.668
*

17:15.702 --> 17:18.638
Magic was the one thing
I sensed could reunite

17:18.671 --> 17:22.109
Paulie's pre-traumatized,
childish, joyful self,

17:22.142 --> 17:25.312
with the anxious, troubled,
young man he was becoming.

17:25.345 --> 17:26.813
I thought it would permit him

17:26.846 --> 17:30.150
to feel this lack
of understanding as a wonder,

17:30.183 --> 17:31.851
not another source of fear.

17:31.884 --> 17:33.853
- And you succeeded.

17:33.886 --> 17:35.655
- Perhaps too well.

17:35.688 --> 17:39.326
He began living in the wonder
and neglecting what's real.

17:39.359 --> 17:41.494
I weaved for him a fiction

17:41.528 --> 17:44.631
no different than the one Libby
Hatch has created for herself.

17:44.664 --> 17:46.433
- No, you're simply looking
for ways to punish yourself.

17:46.466 --> 17:48.768
Truth is, Laszlo,
you did help him.

17:48.801 --> 17:51.003
You helped him to look ahead,

17:51.037 --> 17:54.707
and I might argue that
it is the absence of wonder

17:54.741 --> 17:58.545
that molds a child into
a person like Libby hatch.

18:00.180 --> 18:04.851
You might take some time
to look ahead for yourself.

18:06.586 --> 18:08.955
Grandiosity and self-doubt
are--

18:08.988 --> 18:11.558
- Fatal.

18:12.525 --> 18:15.395
- They can be.

18:18.030 --> 18:19.699
- I need to get back
to the Institute.

18:19.732 --> 18:23.670
The police are bringing a
medical expert to see if I--

18:23.703 --> 18:25.972
if I'm competent
to be its director.

18:26.005 --> 18:28.040
- [inhales deeply]

18:35.215 --> 18:36.216
[flash powder bangs]

18:36.249 --> 18:39.386
[dark music]

18:39.419 --> 18:40.687
- Looks like something

18:40.720 --> 18:43.022
Stevenson or Shelley
might conjure up.

18:43.055 --> 18:46.058
- Everything about this
is disturbing.

18:46.092 --> 18:50.930
- It's Libby who is disturbed
and growing more so by the day.

18:50.963 --> 18:54.367
I'd rather not imagine
what else she's capable of.

18:54.401 --> 18:56.369
[flash powder bangs
and sizzles]

18:56.403 --> 19:01.541
*

19:01.574 --> 19:04.110
Memory boxes, if I'm correct,
Marcus.

19:04.143 --> 19:07.380
- Each containing mementos from
the infant's earliest days.

19:07.414 --> 19:10.116
Some are what the child wore
in death.

19:10.149 --> 19:13.220
*

19:13.253 --> 19:14.787
Baby's hair.

19:14.821 --> 19:16.756
It's called a mourning brooch.

19:16.789 --> 19:20.126
From an earlier infanticide,
I suspect, given the contents.

19:20.159 --> 19:22.262
- Laszlo needs to see this.

19:22.295 --> 19:23.896
- I'm curious as to why
he's not in his office.

19:23.930 --> 19:26.032
I have called him
several times.

19:26.065 --> 19:33.105
*

19:36.809 --> 19:38.945
- Do you recognize this, John?

19:38.978 --> 19:45.618
*

19:45.652 --> 19:48.755
- It's a family crest
of some sort.

19:48.788 --> 19:51.491
I don't know whose it is.

19:51.524 --> 19:58.798
*

20:35.902 --> 20:39.205
[sizzling]

20:40.573 --> 20:42.174
- [groans]

20:42.208 --> 20:49.248
*

20:51.684 --> 20:55.722
She's gone.

20:55.755 --> 20:58.190
She's gone, Goo Goo.

20:58.224 --> 21:00.693
- I know, I know.

21:00.727 --> 21:05.465
*

21:05.498 --> 21:07.233
We'll make everything better.

21:07.266 --> 21:09.235
I promise.

21:09.268 --> 21:12.705
*

21:12.739 --> 21:17.544
- I'm sore.
[groans]

21:17.577 --> 21:20.547
*

21:20.580 --> 21:23.550
[moaning]

21:23.583 --> 21:26.386
*

21:26.419 --> 21:29.255
We're gonna be happy, Goo Goo.

21:29.288 --> 21:31.691
*

21:31.724 --> 21:33.693
We're gonna be happy.

21:33.726 --> 21:38.365
*

21:38.398 --> 21:41.934
[children shouting excitedly]

21:44.904 --> 21:46.539
- As a representative

21:46.573 --> 21:50.209
for the Board for the New York
City Medical Institutions,

21:50.242 --> 21:51.744
I'm hereby informing you

21:51.778 --> 21:55.247
that this institute
is now under investigation.

21:55.281 --> 21:57.950
- For?

21:57.984 --> 22:00.520
- Possible criminal negligence
in the treatment of minors.

22:00.553 --> 22:02.021
- Will you be bringing
your objectivity

22:02.054 --> 22:04.123
to this investigation, Markoe?

22:04.156 --> 22:05.558
- You, Dr. Kreizler,

22:05.592 --> 22:08.528
are suspended by the state
from practicing medicine,

22:08.561 --> 22:12.799
advising professionally in
your capacity as an alienist,

22:12.832 --> 22:15.602
until the board completes
its investigation.

22:15.635 --> 22:17.136
- Paulie is a complex patient,

22:17.169 --> 22:18.938
and you are
deliberately mischaracterizing

22:18.971 --> 22:20.540
what has caused his injury.

22:20.573 --> 22:23.476
To deliver him
to a doctor like you

22:23.510 --> 22:25.445
could do irreparable harm
to the boy.

22:25.478 --> 22:29.281
- A boy in your care tried to
strangle himself in your office

22:29.315 --> 22:31.884
and you're lecturing me
about doing harm?

22:31.918 --> 22:33.285
- It is my judgment

22:33.319 --> 22:35.087
that it wasn't an instance
of suicidal ideation.

22:35.121 --> 22:36.823
- Oh, so you have no concern
about the boy?

22:36.856 --> 22:39.492
- I did not say that.

22:39.526 --> 22:42.294
I am concerned.

22:43.295 --> 22:44.964
- Well, that matter's
been decided.

22:44.997 --> 22:47.600
You'll have your chance
to appeal.

22:47.634 --> 22:49.068
Of course,
you know how difficult it is

22:49.101 --> 22:50.903
to gather the board
in the summertime,

22:50.937 --> 22:53.740
what with everyone away.

22:53.773 --> 22:55.408
Still,

22:55.442 --> 22:59.245
plenty of time to contemplate
your panoply of failings.

22:59.278 --> 23:02.615
*

23:02.649 --> 23:04.350
- How can they do this?

23:04.383 --> 23:05.652
This is nonsense.

23:05.685 --> 23:07.019
You have a history
of championing those

23:07.053 --> 23:09.422
who cannot care for themselves.

23:09.456 --> 23:11.491
Surely, you can make an appeal.

23:11.524 --> 23:12.992
- There's no laboratory test

23:13.025 --> 23:15.161
to prove the soundness
of my judgment,

23:15.194 --> 23:17.329
nor the safety
of my clinical methods.

23:17.363 --> 23:20.633
- [sighs] Well,
if there's anything I can do.

23:20.667 --> 23:23.870
You should not have
to shoulder this burden alone.

23:26.539 --> 23:29.509
- I haven't.
[clears throat]

23:29.542 --> 23:32.445
I didn't.

23:32.479 --> 23:35.515
There is someone who has been
a consolation to me.

23:35.548 --> 23:38.350
- Someone?

23:38.384 --> 23:40.787
- A woman.
- Oh.

23:40.820 --> 23:42.789
- Not quite.

23:42.822 --> 23:47.694
She's a formidable woman,
a professor of psychology.

23:47.727 --> 23:49.929
Karen Stratton.

23:53.065 --> 23:56.135
She's given me great counsel.

23:56.168 --> 23:59.906
- A kindred spirit.
- Perhaps.

24:00.840 --> 24:04.410
Yes, I think she is.

24:05.411 --> 24:08.047
- I'm happy for you, Laszlo,

24:08.080 --> 24:12.351
that you found such
an agreeable companion.

24:12.384 --> 24:14.153
And that John has, too.

24:14.186 --> 24:17.557
[soft dramatic music]

24:17.590 --> 24:20.560
- Indeed.
[sighs]

24:20.593 --> 24:23.195
*

24:23.229 --> 24:26.766
- I'm sorry, V.
It's been a strange day.

24:29.602 --> 24:34.006
There is something I would like
to speak with you about

24:34.040 --> 24:36.008
which is troubling me.

24:36.042 --> 24:40.079
- Well, that can't stand,
can it?

24:40.112 --> 24:42.281
I won't let you be troubled
when you're with me.

24:42.314 --> 24:43.883
It's not permitted.

24:43.916 --> 24:46.786
Please, look at me.

24:48.621 --> 24:52.525
You know I love you,
don't you?

24:52.559 --> 24:54.193
- Of course.

24:54.226 --> 24:58.765
- Then you know that is no
easy feat for someone like me,

24:58.798 --> 25:02.068
for someone whose family she's
not allowed to acknowledge,

25:02.101 --> 25:03.703
who's always aware
of the whispers

25:03.736 --> 25:05.271
when she enters a room,

25:05.304 --> 25:11.043
who's never had a place
or a name to call her own.

25:11.077 --> 25:13.445
And this is why I cannot wait

25:13.479 --> 25:16.783
to be announced
as Mr. John Schuyler Moore

25:16.816 --> 25:19.118
on our big day.

25:19.151 --> 25:24.156
In belonging to you,
I will finally belong.

25:28.494 --> 25:31.197
[floorboards creak]

25:32.498 --> 25:34.133
[door closes]

25:34.166 --> 25:37.604
- You can open your eyes now,
Goo Goo.

25:37.637 --> 25:40.139
[chuckles]
What do you think?

25:40.172 --> 25:42.975
- Wow.
- [chuckles]

25:43.009 --> 25:46.512
[sighs]
- You look beautiful.

25:46.545 --> 25:48.014
Like a lady.

25:48.047 --> 25:51.017
Like a proper
high society lady.

25:51.050 --> 25:54.987
*

25:55.021 --> 25:57.990
[suspenseful music]

25:58.024 --> 26:05.297
*

26:33.359 --> 26:36.796
- Find any acorns
in your stack?

26:36.829 --> 26:37.997
- Nothing yet.

26:38.030 --> 26:39.832
*

26:39.866 --> 26:41.834
[children shouting playfully]

26:41.868 --> 26:48.540
*

26:48.574 --> 26:51.678
[soft suspenseful music]

26:51.711 --> 26:58.918
*

27:41.293 --> 27:43.863
- My God.

27:43.896 --> 27:45.064
Look.

27:45.097 --> 27:48.768
*

27:48.801 --> 27:51.971
- Vanderbilt.

27:52.004 --> 27:53.773
- Do you think
we should warn them?

27:53.806 --> 27:55.775
[baby cries]

27:55.808 --> 28:03.082
*

28:07.086 --> 28:10.056
- [giggles and babbles]

28:10.089 --> 28:17.163
*

28:40.652 --> 28:43.622
- [screaming]

28:43.655 --> 28:46.625
[ominous music]

28:46.658 --> 28:51.497
*

28:51.530 --> 28:53.199
[screams]

28:56.702 --> 28:59.872
[soft suspenseful music]

28:59.906 --> 29:06.612
*

29:06.645 --> 29:09.015
- We're closed.

29:09.048 --> 29:12.018
- We ain't here
for the swill today.

29:12.051 --> 29:17.489
*

29:17.523 --> 29:20.526
You brought them around here.

29:20.559 --> 29:25.131
Snoopin',
messing with Goo Goo's girl,

29:25.164 --> 29:29.368
taking what ain't yours.

29:29.401 --> 29:31.503
*

29:31.537 --> 29:33.505
Nothing to say now, huh?

29:36.342 --> 29:37.877
- I'd like you to leave.

29:40.446 --> 29:41.814
[yelps]

29:41.848 --> 29:45.051
[breathing heavily]

29:47.719 --> 29:50.022
- You get the hell out of here!

29:53.425 --> 29:56.929
- Ah, the main man.

29:58.865 --> 30:00.532
We were just telling
your girl here--

30:00.566 --> 30:03.569
- I ain't gonna tell you again.

30:05.404 --> 30:09.075
- We were just leaving.

30:09.108 --> 30:16.148
*

30:23.722 --> 30:26.392
- Huh?
You okay?

30:26.425 --> 30:28.660
- Mm.

30:32.631 --> 30:34.700
You can cross off
the Roald Vanderbilts

30:34.733 --> 30:36.435
as they have moved to France.

30:36.468 --> 30:37.803
- Done.

30:37.836 --> 30:39.438
- Frederick and his family
have been in Newport

30:39.471 --> 30:41.140
for a month already.

30:41.173 --> 30:45.044
- Sara, there's a very fancy
carriage outside.

30:45.077 --> 30:47.213
One of the footmen said
to give you this.

30:47.246 --> 30:49.048
He says you are
to come right away.

30:49.081 --> 30:50.449
- Oh, dear.

30:50.482 --> 30:53.452
[soft suspenseful music]

30:53.485 --> 30:55.721
*

30:55.754 --> 30:57.256
We're too late.

30:57.289 --> 31:04.530
*

31:06.365 --> 31:09.335
[dramatic music]

31:09.368 --> 31:15.908
*

31:15.942 --> 31:19.078
- Thank you for coming.
Alice is distraught, of course.

31:19.111 --> 31:22.148
We just received a telegram
from my son

31:22.181 --> 31:24.083
asking after his boy.

31:24.116 --> 31:26.518
- I'm honored that
you'd ask for me, Cornelius.

31:26.552 --> 31:29.989
- I want your reporters to keep
a lookout for my grandson.

31:30.022 --> 31:33.025
They have leads, informers,
don't they?

31:33.059 --> 31:36.095
- Yes, yes, we get
to the underbelly of this city.

31:36.128 --> 31:39.131
- No one must know, of course.
- Obviously.

31:40.399 --> 31:42.969
- I hired every damn Pinkerton
in the city.

31:43.002 --> 31:45.437
We don't want the
New York Police Department

31:45.471 --> 31:48.107
and the phony ransom notes
that come with publicity,

31:48.140 --> 31:49.875
and I don't want my son
to know yet.

31:49.908 --> 31:53.946
Somewhere in the Mediterranean.

31:53.980 --> 31:58.784
Left that child with us
for--for one lousy month.

31:58.817 --> 32:01.620
*

32:01.653 --> 32:03.522
What do you know about her?

32:03.555 --> 32:06.792
- I'm not sure you want another
party on this search, sir.

32:06.825 --> 32:08.227
It will dilute our efforts

32:08.260 --> 32:11.030
and perhaps bring
unwanted notoriety to the case.

32:11.063 --> 32:14.233
She's a renegade,
a man in a corset.

32:14.266 --> 32:17.903
- She's a bored society girl
who dabbles.

32:17.936 --> 32:20.739
- Well, I want to find out
for myself.

32:20.772 --> 32:23.309
Miss Howard is on her way here.

32:23.342 --> 32:30.349
*

32:41.027 --> 32:44.063
- A slip of a girl can't roam
these streets, or these.

32:44.096 --> 32:45.664
- You wouldn't let
your own daughter

32:45.697 --> 32:47.166
go anywhere near that place,
would you?

32:47.199 --> 32:49.835
- Funny, I've just come
from those streets.

32:49.868 --> 32:51.537
Assuming I'm
the "slip of a girl"

32:51.570 --> 32:55.041
you're referring to,
Mr. Byrnes?

32:56.408 --> 32:58.510
Sara Howard, Mr. Vanderbilt.

32:58.544 --> 33:00.512
Mr. Hearst.
- Miss Howard.

33:00.546 --> 33:02.381
So good to finally meet you.

33:02.414 --> 33:05.717
Your exploits have been
wonderful for our circulation.

33:05.751 --> 33:08.854
- [sighs]
My grandson's been kidnapped.

33:08.887 --> 33:11.757
- I know.
- How?

33:11.790 --> 33:14.193
- The Linares case
just wasn't over for me,

33:14.226 --> 33:16.462
not when I let Miss Hatch
escape.

33:16.495 --> 33:18.630
She had a secret room
where she kept the child,

33:18.664 --> 33:20.699
and I went back and I found it.

33:20.732 --> 33:23.735
And I also found these.

33:31.677 --> 33:34.213
- These items,
they're our crest.

33:34.246 --> 33:37.083
- Miss Hatch clearly had
some design on your family.

33:37.116 --> 33:40.052
She kept this jewelry box
and hairbrush in her lair.

33:40.086 --> 33:41.887
Miss Hatch stockpiled
personal items

33:41.920 --> 33:43.555
from the Linares family
as well,

33:43.589 --> 33:45.657
which suggested that
her collection of keepsakes

33:45.691 --> 33:48.060
indicated malicious intent
towards certain families,

33:48.094 --> 33:50.062
including your own,
Mr. Vanderbilt.

33:50.096 --> 33:52.164
I will take on your case.

33:52.198 --> 33:54.066
I do have some conditions,
however.

33:54.100 --> 33:56.235
- Oh, now the caveats come out.

33:56.268 --> 33:57.903
- Dr. Laszlo Kreizler
was suspended

33:57.936 --> 33:59.338
from practicing alienism

33:59.371 --> 34:01.573
as the result
of an unfortunate accident.

34:01.607 --> 34:04.743
- The police are investigating
some negligence

34:04.776 --> 34:07.746
at the, uh--
- Go on, Miss Howard.

34:07.779 --> 34:09.081
- Dr. Kreizler is most crucial

34:09.115 --> 34:10.982
to the investigations
that I conduct.

34:11.016 --> 34:12.751
He has insights
into the criminal psyche

34:12.784 --> 34:13.852
that are invaluable.

34:13.885 --> 34:15.321
- Abstractions and hypotheses.

34:15.354 --> 34:18.190
Kreizler meddles, sir,
for his own purposes.

34:18.224 --> 34:21.427
- He helped you get
that Spanish baby back.

34:21.460 --> 34:23.362
- I could not have done it
without him.

34:23.395 --> 34:25.097
- Hmm.
- I'll need him reinstated

34:25.131 --> 34:26.932
in order to legally
join my team.

34:26.965 --> 34:28.334
- There was another condition?

34:28.367 --> 34:31.103
- It involves
the ex-commissioner.

34:31.137 --> 34:33.139
I am the lead detective
on this case.

34:33.172 --> 34:36.108
I do not work for Mr. Byrnes;
Mr. Byrnes works for me

34:36.142 --> 34:39.111
and will follow my directives
at all times.

34:39.145 --> 34:41.447
- I have 30 years'
more experience.

34:41.480 --> 34:45.351
- You didn't find the secret
room or retrieve its contents,

34:45.384 --> 34:46.985
did you?

34:49.821 --> 34:51.323
That's agreed.

34:51.357 --> 34:53.559
And you're hired.

34:53.592 --> 34:55.827
- Thank you, Mr. Vanderbilt.

34:58.430 --> 34:59.731
Laszlo.

34:59.765 --> 35:02.801
- How is the child?

35:02.834 --> 35:04.670
- He says he was trying
to emulate Houdini,

35:04.703 --> 35:06.338
but I suspect otherwise.

35:06.372 --> 35:09.341
But I assume it was
a desperate plea for affection.

35:09.375 --> 35:12.311
[dramatic music]

35:12.344 --> 35:15.814
I failed him.
- You did not fail him.

35:15.847 --> 35:18.016
You did everything you could
for him.

35:18.049 --> 35:20.319
*

35:20.352 --> 35:23.322
- Paulie does not yet know
the Institute is closed.

35:23.355 --> 35:26.692
- Where will he go,
should it not be reopened?

35:26.725 --> 35:29.561
- I fear he will be sent
to an orphanage.

35:30.696 --> 35:32.398
- Well, there's only one thing
for it, then.

35:32.431 --> 35:35.100
- It is an exercise
in futility, Sara.

35:35.133 --> 35:37.102
Even your Mr. Vanderbilt
does not have the power

35:37.135 --> 35:39.838
to overturn the state board
without quorum.

35:39.871 --> 35:43.041
- Do not abandon hope, Laszlo.

35:43.074 --> 35:45.277
Help me find the Vanderbilt
child and Libby Hatch.

35:45.311 --> 35:47.112
And not only will we find them,

35:47.145 --> 35:50.282
but I promise you I will hold
Vanderbilt to his word.

35:50.316 --> 35:52.451
The Institute will be reopened.

35:52.484 --> 35:54.953
*

35:54.986 --> 35:57.923
Let us begin
with what we know.

36:01.159 --> 36:03.295
[soft dramatic music]

36:03.329 --> 36:08.133
- Libby Hatch.
Question is, who is she?

36:08.166 --> 36:10.602
Who is she,
and where is she from?

36:10.636 --> 36:12.738
*

36:12.771 --> 36:17.643
- I perceived, when we
first met, a bond of kinship,

36:17.676 --> 36:20.111
as if were it not
for the circumstances,

36:20.145 --> 36:21.947
we would've been friends.

36:21.980 --> 36:24.616
- You liked her?

36:24.650 --> 36:25.784
Why?

36:25.817 --> 36:27.453
- She was vulnerable.

36:27.486 --> 36:31.156
Her manner apprehensive,
her actions tentative.

36:31.189 --> 36:33.959
Yet there was
an intelligence there.

36:33.992 --> 36:37.162
She wanted me to know her.

36:37.195 --> 36:39.331
And yet, she deceived me.

36:39.365 --> 36:40.932
- Liars are like magicians.

36:40.966 --> 36:45.136
We are deceived by what we see,
what we are told,

36:45.170 --> 36:46.338
but beneath
the sleight-of-hand,

36:46.372 --> 36:47.839
there's still
a simple trick.

36:47.873 --> 36:51.243
- I fail to see the comparison.

36:51.277 --> 36:53.679
- I believe
what Laszlo means is that

36:53.712 --> 36:57.416
good liars and con artists
can make us believe them.

36:57.449 --> 36:59.985
They combine the unalloyed
truth with the falsehoods,

37:00.018 --> 37:01.920
something they believe
themselves.

37:01.953 --> 37:05.156
Libby might well have told you
a truth about who she is.

37:05.190 --> 37:06.592
- Because you see, Sara,

37:06.625 --> 37:08.627
unquestionably,
the bond you felt for her,

37:08.660 --> 37:11.196
in her mind, was genuine.

37:11.229 --> 37:15.200
So something she said
must've been the truth.

37:15.233 --> 37:21.206
*

37:21.239 --> 37:24.310
- Her father.

37:24.343 --> 37:25.944
There was a moment when

37:25.977 --> 37:29.948
she saw the photograph of my
father in my pocket watch.

37:29.981 --> 37:31.483
She asked me who it was.

37:31.517 --> 37:34.386
- Is that your boyfriend?

37:34.420 --> 37:37.956
- No, no.
It's my father.

37:37.989 --> 37:40.191
And I don't know why, but...

37:40.225 --> 37:44.396
something about her, her look,
I--I'm not sure,

37:44.430 --> 37:49.000
but something made me confess
to her how he had died.

37:49.034 --> 37:52.404
*

37:52.438 --> 37:56.575
He had an accident with a gun.

37:56.608 --> 38:00.746
*

38:00.779 --> 38:02.848
- What did she tell you
in return?

38:02.881 --> 38:06.017
- She told me
of her own father.

38:06.051 --> 38:08.153
*

38:08.186 --> 38:09.588
- I know about that sort
of thing.

38:09.621 --> 38:13.392
M-my father, he--

38:13.425 --> 38:16.495
he had a accident, too.

38:16.528 --> 38:19.731
With him,
it was a rope over a bridge.

38:19.765 --> 38:24.570
*

38:24.603 --> 38:26.905
- This is very significant,
Sara.

38:26.938 --> 38:30.776
- Such a public act would
doubtless have been reported.

38:30.809 --> 38:34.012
We find out who the father is,
we find out who Libby is

38:34.045 --> 38:36.515
and maybe where she's gone.

38:36.548 --> 38:38.384
But I think
the "New York Times" archives

38:38.417 --> 38:41.553
might have that information.

38:41.587 --> 38:42.688
Sara,

38:42.721 --> 38:44.456
if you have no prior
engagements,

38:44.490 --> 38:47.626
a spare pair of hands would be
very much appreciated.

38:47.659 --> 38:51.463
*

38:51.497 --> 38:53.632
Good day.

38:53.665 --> 39:00.672
*

39:06.077 --> 39:07.446
- There was something else
I saw

39:07.479 --> 39:10.115
when I followed Libby
that night.

39:10.148 --> 39:11.550
I hadn't mentioned it before,

39:11.583 --> 39:15.153
because we had already found
Anna Linares.

39:15.186 --> 39:17.389
- What was it?

39:17.423 --> 39:22.227
- I observed from afar Libby
and Goo Goo Knox.

39:22.260 --> 39:24.830
She appeared to be nursing him.

39:24.863 --> 39:30.068
He was feeding from her,
and yet it also seemed carnal.

39:30.101 --> 39:33.271
- Lactophilia.

39:33.304 --> 39:34.840
It's most curious.

39:34.873 --> 39:38.009
[suspenseful music]

39:38.043 --> 39:40.078
[indistinct chatter]

39:40.111 --> 39:43.615
It is a fascinating case.

39:43.649 --> 39:47.152
- What disturbs you
about this one?

39:47.185 --> 39:48.787
- Well,
it's an unexpected fetish

39:48.820 --> 39:53.024
for a woman who uses her
breasts as deliverers of death.

39:53.058 --> 39:54.593
- A dramatic turn of phrase

39:54.626 --> 39:58.630
for something I might argue
might not be a fetish at all.

39:58.664 --> 40:01.933
- You wouldn't consider
this behavior a deviation?

40:01.967 --> 40:04.269
I am surprised to hear
such an argument.

40:04.302 --> 40:07.372
- From a woman.

40:07.405 --> 40:08.874
- The most recent studies
suggest

40:08.907 --> 40:11.610
a fetish is a means by which
a man reduces a woman

40:11.643 --> 40:13.445
to a fraction of herself,

40:13.479 --> 40:16.715
experiencing sexual
gratification.

40:16.748 --> 40:19.685
The fetish is pleasurable
because it partializes a woman

40:19.718 --> 40:22.387
and thereby renders her
non-threatening.

40:22.420 --> 40:26.224
- Has that been
your experience?

40:26.257 --> 40:29.194
[soft dramatic music]

40:29.227 --> 40:30.629
- Sorry?

40:30.662 --> 40:33.198
- If your gaze were attracted
by a shapely bosom,

40:33.231 --> 40:35.967
do you forget about the woman
to whom these parts belong?

40:36.001 --> 40:37.402
- [chuckles]

40:37.435 --> 40:42.974
*

40:43.008 --> 40:47.212
- Have you forgotten all of me
when you see my ankle?

40:47.245 --> 40:51.049
*

40:51.082 --> 40:52.518
- I don't categorize myself

40:52.551 --> 40:54.720
among the sufferers
of this pathology.

40:54.753 --> 40:56.522
- Perhaps this type
of attraction

40:56.555 --> 40:58.189
is not the pathology at all,

40:58.223 --> 41:02.160
and perhaps a woman might enjoy
her part in such a ritual.

41:02.193 --> 41:05.430
*

41:05.463 --> 41:09.200
With adult males, a woman's
breasts are life-affirming.

41:09.234 --> 41:11.036
She doesn't use them
in this context;

41:11.069 --> 41:14.773
she puts them in a position
to respond to pleasure.

41:14.806 --> 41:18.276
*

41:18.309 --> 41:20.178
[whispers]
Breasts are erogenous zones.

41:20.211 --> 41:22.581
- [chuckles]

41:22.614 --> 41:26.552
I'm aware of that, of course.

41:26.585 --> 41:28.119
But the public nature of it?

41:28.153 --> 41:30.956
- It's interesting, I agree.

41:33.625 --> 41:37.128
- I served this city
as a police officer.

41:37.162 --> 41:39.965
I served the interests
of upstanding citizens

41:39.998 --> 41:42.634
like yourself.

41:42.668 --> 41:45.971
I will not have my career
devalued by a dilettante.

41:46.004 --> 41:49.240
- She is a pox upon all of us.
On that, we can agree.

41:49.274 --> 41:53.444
But the world works on a system
of patronage, Byrnes,

41:53.478 --> 41:56.915
and Vanderbilt sits at the top
of the heap.

41:56.948 --> 42:00.652
Like it or not, you need
his favor just as I do.

42:00.686 --> 42:02.988
- I will not take orders
from her.

42:03.021 --> 42:07.926
- Well, whether or not you do
is your prerogative.

42:07.959 --> 42:10.495
But...

42:10.528 --> 42:15.500
if I were you,
I'd see this as an opportunity

42:15.533 --> 42:18.403
to show the upstanding citizens
of New York

42:18.436 --> 42:22.440
exactly where they should
put their stock.

42:25.443 --> 42:31.349
- This--[grunts]
is '81 to '82.

42:31.382 --> 42:33.351
- Could this be her?

42:33.384 --> 42:40.659
*

42:42.728 --> 42:45.697
- "He is survived by his wife,
Mallory Hunter,

42:45.731 --> 42:48.967
and his daughter,
Elspeth Hunter, of Brooklyn."

42:49.000 --> 42:50.969
- E.H.

42:51.002 --> 42:53.672
*

42:53.705 --> 42:57.976
Same initials as the doll buyer
at Siegel-Cooper.

42:58.009 --> 43:02.547
- Elspeth Hunter.
- This really could be her.

43:02.580 --> 43:04.015
- And where
would Elspeth Hunter go

43:04.049 --> 43:07.653
if she was hunted by the
New York Police Department?

43:07.686 --> 43:10.555
- Somewhere out
of their jurisdiction.

43:10.588 --> 43:13.725
- Somewhere familiar
where she could hide away.

43:13.759 --> 43:16.061
- Or knows someone who'd be
willing to hide her.

43:22.600 --> 43:25.704
[dark music]

43:25.737 --> 43:28.740
*

43:28.774 --> 43:30.809
- Look.
[chuckles]

43:30.842 --> 43:33.311
Look at the little
sucking motions

43:33.344 --> 43:34.345
he makes when he sleeps.

43:34.379 --> 43:35.546
He's thinking of his mom.

43:35.580 --> 43:37.916
- [chuckles]

43:37.949 --> 43:40.018
I hope he and I don't come
to blows.

43:40.051 --> 43:42.587
I ain't losing out to the likes
of you, you little beggar.

43:42.620 --> 43:44.089
- What?

43:45.356 --> 43:47.325
Show some respect.

43:47.358 --> 43:49.861
Get to packing.

43:49.895 --> 43:52.764
They're gonna be looking
for us.

43:52.798 --> 43:55.566
- [fusses]
- Aww.

43:55.600 --> 43:58.737
- Where are we going?
- I know somewhere we can go.

44:00.972 --> 44:03.174
- Miss Hatch
has so far operated

44:03.208 --> 44:05.443
within a very narrow
geographical area,

44:05.476 --> 44:08.780
returning time and again
to the same spots.

44:08.814 --> 44:11.116
- We have taken all those spots
from her.

44:11.149 --> 44:13.685
Her home, her workplace,
her hiding places.

44:13.719 --> 44:15.120
And Mr. Byrnes is--

44:15.153 --> 44:17.288
- We have all of Manhattan
under surveillance

44:17.322 --> 44:18.389
for you, sir.

44:18.423 --> 44:20.125
- Mm.

44:20.158 --> 44:22.861
- She hails from Brooklyn,
which is our next port of call.

44:22.894 --> 44:27.232
- And how will chasing
her roots recover my grandson?

44:27.265 --> 44:30.468
- Fleeing Manhattan is
the logical next step for her.

44:30.501 --> 44:33.739
She's been deprived
of most other options.

44:33.772 --> 44:35.273
- Let's go.

44:35.306 --> 44:40.645
*

44:40.678 --> 44:44.049
- Her mind will steer her
to the next familiar place.

44:44.082 --> 44:46.151
- Which is Brooklyn.

44:47.986 --> 44:52.991
- We will find your grandson.
I'm quite certain of it.

44:55.693 --> 45:02.968
*

45:12.477 --> 45:14.012
- Where are you going?

45:14.045 --> 45:15.747
Sun's gonna be up
before you know it.

45:15.781 --> 45:17.916
- I just--I wanna show him.

45:17.949 --> 45:20.485
- Oh, Christ.

45:20.518 --> 45:22.954
Remember that girl stepped
straight off the roof

45:22.988 --> 45:24.522
thinking she was headed
to the toilets.

45:24.555 --> 45:26.324
- I'm not sleepwalking, fool.

45:26.357 --> 45:29.660
- Hey, would you knock it off?
- In a minute.

45:29.694 --> 45:31.763
- People are trying
to sleep here, lady.

45:31.797 --> 45:39.004
*

45:43.842 --> 45:45.977
- [gasps]
Oh.

45:46.011 --> 45:51.216
You see, my handsome boy?
Isn't she beautiful?

45:51.249 --> 45:52.650
Huh?

45:52.683 --> 45:58.056
It took a lot of very brave men
to build that bridge.

45:58.089 --> 46:01.993
The bigger that bridge got,

46:02.027 --> 46:05.931
they just felt smaller
and smaller.

46:06.898 --> 46:10.869
Most nooses usually strangle
a man.

46:10.902 --> 46:13.805
*

46:13.839 --> 46:17.242
Not my papa.

46:17.275 --> 46:19.811
[chuckles]

46:19.845 --> 46:23.414
His neck snapped right in two.

46:23.448 --> 46:27.018
- [coos]
- That's right, little boy.

46:27.052 --> 46:30.021
One minute you're here,
and then...

46:30.055 --> 46:33.691
*

46:33.724 --> 46:37.162
And then--and then snap.

46:37.195 --> 46:40.565
- [fusses]
- You're dead.

46:40.598 --> 46:43.034
Right in the blink of an eye.

46:43.068 --> 46:45.403
- [fusses softly]
