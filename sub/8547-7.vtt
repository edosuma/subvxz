It's like everyone forgot
about Christopher Columbus.

00:36.585 --> 00:38.218
I'm pretty sure
that was last month.

00:38.220 --> 00:41.254
No, Thanksgiving.
You can't put up a Christmas tree

00:41.256 --> 00:42.455
before you eat stuffing.

00:42.457 --> 00:43.690
Like you eat stuffing.

00:43.692 --> 00:46.359
All I'm saying is that
it's a little early

00:46.361 --> 00:48.194
for Rudolph, that's all.

00:48.196 --> 00:50.830
Speaking of noses
of a different color,

00:50.832 --> 00:53.466
why was Jonathan
kissing your ass this morning?

00:53.468 --> 00:55.568
Ohh! I'm so over him.

00:55.570 --> 00:58.605
Just so long as you're over him after
Thanksgiving weekend.

00:58.607 --> 01:00.240
We need his cabin.

01:00.242 --> 01:03.977
Otherwise the snow bunny
shopping venture is pointless.

01:03.979 --> 01:05.312
What are you doing?

01:05.313 --> 01:06.713
Taking a selfie.

01:06.715 --> 01:08.515
My followers
are gonna flip.

01:08.517 --> 01:10.183
So will your dad.

01:10.185 --> 01:12.452
My dad doesn't follow me.

01:12.454 --> 01:14.754
It wouldn't be so bad
if he did, though.

01:14.756 --> 01:16.389
Are you hammed?

01:16.391 --> 01:19.125
Fact check. My dad works
with like a thousand guys.

01:19.127 --> 01:21.895
He goes into the office complaining about
how his teenage daughter

01:21.897 --> 01:24.097
is taking risque photos
on line.

01:24.099 --> 01:25.765
My numbers skyrocket.

01:27.102 --> 01:28.468
You're insane.

01:28.470 --> 01:29.803
What can I say?

01:29.805 --> 01:31.705
I can't help myselfie.

01:39.447 --> 01:41.381
She's obsessive.
So...

01:41.383 --> 01:42.482
She's literally obsessive.

01:42.484 --> 01:43.717
She is obsessed with you.

01:43.719 --> 01:45.618
Had to hang out
like 4 times.

01:45.620 --> 01:46.953
I know.

01:46.955 --> 01:49.356
Sorry.

01:49.358 --> 01:52.459
Hey, I know you.

01:52.461 --> 01:54.094
Tara, right?
Tara Harris.

01:54.096 --> 01:55.996
For sure.
What's your name?

01:55.998 --> 01:57.097
Charles.

01:57.099 --> 01:59.332
Uh, Charles Lorne.

01:59.334 --> 02:00.767
I follow you on Twitter.

02:00.769 --> 02:02.869
And Facebook
and Instagram

02:02.871 --> 02:04.537
and Vine, too.
Are you on Snapchat?

02:04.539 --> 02:07.173
Thank you, Charles.
Share the love.

02:07.175 --> 02:09.976
Oh, I will. I will.

02:12.079 --> 02:16.049
Uh, I'm Herc007.

02:16.884 --> 02:19.019
You retweeted
one of my comments.

02:19.021 --> 02:22.355
I got 16 more
followers after that.

02:22.357 --> 02:23.490
Oh! That's great.

02:23.492 --> 02:25.291
Made me feel
like a star.

02:25.293 --> 02:29.029
I can't believe I'm
meeting you in person.

02:29.031 --> 02:32.298
Well, we should probably
take a picture so you can prove it.

02:32.300 --> 02:35.568
Ohh! Hell, yes,
that would make my year.

02:35.570 --> 02:37.704
Want me to?

02:37.706 --> 02:40.707
No, I think we got this,
right, Charles?

02:43.677 --> 02:45.211
There you go.
Make sure you tag me.

02:45.213 --> 02:47.380
I will. Thanks.
Thanks a lot.

02:47.382 --> 02:49.349
You know he's taking
that picture

02:49.351 --> 02:50.784
straight to the bathroom,
right?

02:50.786 --> 02:52.819
I'm aware.

02:58.426 --> 03:01.694
Run a tox screen.
I'm guessing her severe pain

03:01.696 --> 03:03.129
is another case
of oxy withdrawal.

03:03.131 --> 03:04.497
On it.

03:04.499 --> 03:06.699
You have a patient suffering
severe withdrawal right here, doc.

03:06.701 --> 03:09.869
Does he need
an exam?

03:09.871 --> 03:12.405
I'll go run
that test.

03:12.407 --> 03:14.841
This is a surprise.

03:14.843 --> 03:16.209
You got a minute
to take a walk?

03:16.211 --> 03:18.111
Yeah. Not that
I'm complaining,

03:18.113 --> 03:19.913
but isn't Quantico
the opposite direction?

03:19.915 --> 03:22.048
Well, listen, babe,
you were asleep when I got back.

03:22.050 --> 03:24.050
I knocked on the door
and you didn't answer,

03:24.052 --> 03:26.686
and then you were gone
before I even woke up.

03:26.688 --> 03:29.089
So, I missed you
a little bit. Is that ok?

03:29.091 --> 03:31.391
Mm-hmm. True statement.

03:31.393 --> 03:33.927
But there's something
you're not saying.

03:33.929 --> 03:36.563
Spill it, Derek.
What's on your mind?

03:36.565 --> 03:37.997
Well, I'm actually
kind of wondering

03:37.999 --> 03:40.166
why you haven't
packed yet.

03:40.168 --> 03:41.501
Are you profiling me?

03:41.503 --> 03:44.237
No. No. But I'm not
gonna lie. I did check.

03:44.239 --> 03:46.039
And the profiler in me
would say

03:46.041 --> 03:48.641
that somebody doesn't think that we're
actually going on vacation tomorrow.

03:48.643 --> 03:50.076
Am I right?

03:50.078 --> 03:51.778
Let's just say
I've gotten used to packing

03:51.780 --> 03:54.948
at the last minute.

03:54.950 --> 03:56.583
Look at me.

03:56.585 --> 03:59.586
We are going
on vacation tomorrow.

03:59.588 --> 04:02.088
Mm. I'll believe it
when I see it.

04:02.090 --> 04:03.623
Come on, baby,
don't do that.

04:03.625 --> 04:05.492
Mm. It's not a judgment.

04:05.494 --> 04:08.528
I'm a realist and I've gotten
my hopes up too many times.

04:08.530 --> 04:11.798
Then prepare your cute little self
to get surprised again,

04:11.800 --> 04:13.633
because tomorrow,
come hell or high water,

04:13.635 --> 04:16.469
you and me,
Miss Savannah Hayes,

04:16.471 --> 04:20.240
are going to go find
our own little touch of paradise.

04:22.977 --> 04:23.977
Hmm.

04:23.979 --> 04:25.845
Ok?

04:27.982 --> 04:30.016
Mm.

04:36.957 --> 04:38.825
He tried blocking
all of my accounts,

04:38.827 --> 04:41.027
like I can't get around
parental controls.

04:41.029 --> 04:44.063
And they're legit are taking my car
to his office as we speak.

04:44.065 --> 04:46.566
Doesn't my dad realize
this punishes him, too?

04:46.568 --> 04:49.269
He has to drive me
everywhere now.

04:49.271 --> 04:50.271
Ohh!

04:50.272 --> 04:51.571
I'm so over them.

04:51.573 --> 04:52.939
College can't start
soon enough.

04:52.941 --> 04:55.975
I told you, posting that
selfie wasn't a good idea.

04:55.977 --> 04:58.244
Plus side, Andrew Wells
liked it.

04:58.246 --> 05:00.613
Maybe there's light
after Jonathan after all.

05:00.615 --> 05:02.148
You're so redic.

05:02.150 --> 05:03.283
Ok, I gotta go.

05:03.285 --> 05:04.918
See you tomorrow.

05:20.701 --> 05:22.402
Aah!

05:29.843 --> 05:31.244
No!

05:31.246 --> 05:33.379
No, please...

05:33.381 --> 05:36.616
Oh, God!

05:54.301 --> 05:56.769
Local teenager Tara Harris
found murdered

05:56.771 --> 05:58.338
inside her home last night.

05:58.340 --> 06:01.007
Looks like a blitz blow
to the forehead, then the unsub

06:01.009 --> 06:02.575
stabbed Tara before
slitting her throat.

06:02.577 --> 06:03.843
And he didn't
stop there.

06:03.845 --> 06:05.612
He then used her phone
to upload that image

06:05.614 --> 06:06.980
to all of her
social media sites.

06:06.982 --> 06:08.281
He staged a selfie?

06:08.283 --> 06:09.849
Tara took a lot
of her own selfies.

06:09.851 --> 06:12.151
Maybe the unsub's
creating images to mock her.

06:12.153 --> 06:14.320
Maybe he's got something
against vanity.

06:14.322 --> 06:17.090
Which could mean he has
self-image problems.

06:17.092 --> 06:18.524
He feels ignored
in his everyday life.

06:18.526 --> 06:20.326
What if it was Tara
that ignored him?

06:20.328 --> 06:22.762
This could be
his retribution for rejection.

06:22.764 --> 06:24.297
All I know is
if this guy's into selfies,

06:24.299 --> 06:26.032
we've got a larger problem
on our hands.

06:26.034 --> 06:27.500
They're all the rage
these days.

06:27.502 --> 06:31.604
I know. CNN even does a column
dedicated to selfies of the week.

06:31.606 --> 06:33.373
It's all I can do to keep
Meg from posting them.

06:33.375 --> 06:34.974
I mean, don't people
understand the dangers

06:34.976 --> 06:37.677
of putting their lives out there
like that for everyone to see?

06:37.679 --> 06:40.213
If everybody's doing it, the unsub
only has to look to the Internet

06:40.215 --> 06:41.948
for a sea of potential
new victims.

06:41.950 --> 06:44.417
Unless Tara was just a one-off,
this could be personal.

06:44.419 --> 06:46.119
What makes you think
it'll go serial?

06:46.121 --> 06:48.821
Show him.

06:51.025 --> 06:53.326
He issued a taunt.

06:53.328 --> 06:56.429
He thinks he's just
getting started.

It's already received

That's exactly
what the unsub wants.

08:08.112 --> 08:10.479
The "Fear Me" taunt certainly
speaks to the killer's arrogance.

08:10.481 --> 08:11.881
Yeah, or vulnerable
narcissism.

08:11.883 --> 08:14.316
He feels like crap so he boasts
to the world how great he is.

08:14.318 --> 08:16.786
Recent studies have
linked the excessive taking of selfies

08:16.788 --> 08:19.121
to narcissism, addiction,
even mental illness.

08:19.123 --> 08:21.657
Maybe the unsub had
a misconstrued bond with Tara.

08:21.659 --> 08:23.159
He wouldn't be
the only one.

08:23.161 --> 08:24.760
I've gone over her
subscriber numbers.

08:24.762 --> 08:27.163
She has over 200,000
followers.

08:27.165 --> 08:29.131
Isn't that a lot
for a 16-year-old?

08:29.133 --> 08:30.281
Yeah. It's massive.

08:30.304 --> 08:31.934
She was on her way
to iCelebrity status.

08:31.936 --> 08:33.969
Yeah, what was she doing
to get all those followers?

08:33.971 --> 08:35.905
She posted pictures
daily, videos daily.

08:35.907 --> 08:37.506
Mostly high-energy,
long-winded rants.

08:37.508 --> 08:39.642
She knew how to toe the line
between right and raunchy.

08:39.644 --> 08:41.342
Maybe the unsub
was attracted to her.

08:41.345 --> 08:43.712
Stabbing is typically
a substitution for sex.

08:43.714 --> 08:45.714
Well, let's not rule out
jealousy.

08:45.716 --> 08:47.283
There's an unfortunate
number of people

08:47.285 --> 08:48.517
who attach their self-worth

08:48.519 --> 08:50.486
to the amount of "friends"
following them online.

08:50.488 --> 08:52.288
I don't think the blow
to the mirror was coincidental.

08:52.290 --> 08:54.690
I think she was looking at herself
when she was attacked.

08:54.692 --> 08:58.194
He's commenting on her vanity,
which explains the selfie.

08:58.196 --> 08:59.829
He's making a statement.

08:59.831 --> 09:01.897
He wants people to look at him
instead of themselves.

09:01.899 --> 09:03.499
He feels ignored.

09:03.501 --> 09:05.901
Well, he's got our attention now,
so let's make him regret it.

09:05.903 --> 09:07.970
Let's go.

09:08.839 --> 09:10.406
Sir?

09:10.408 --> 09:12.575
The media's gotten
ahold of the story.

09:12.577 --> 09:15.311
We need to contain this.
This unsub's looking for attention.

09:15.313 --> 09:16.612
Getting his story
on the news

09:16.614 --> 09:18.447
is only going to make him
want to kill again.

09:18.449 --> 09:21.083
The man many are calling
the selfie killer

09:21.085 --> 09:24.954
has left many in this quiet neighborhood
demanding answers.

09:24.956 --> 09:27.389
Move back, please.

09:27.391 --> 09:29.892
Now back to our
breaking news story.

09:29.894 --> 09:33.429
Our reporter Cynthia Wilson
is live at the scene of the attack.

09:33.431 --> 09:35.097
Cynthia,
what's happening there?

09:35.099 --> 09:37.066
What can you tell us?

09:37.068 --> 09:38.334
It looks like
federal agents

09:38.336 --> 09:40.769
are arriving
on the scene now.

09:40.771 --> 09:42.538
We'll see if we can
get a statement.

09:50.514 --> 09:52.648
Agents, can you tell us
what happened here?

09:52.650 --> 09:53.983
No comment.

09:53.985 --> 09:56.652
Will the selfie
killer strike again?

09:58.788 --> 10:01.690
Agents, I'm Detective
Dawn Rosenburg.

10:01.692 --> 10:03.692
SSA Derek Morgan,
this is Dr. Spencer Reid.

10:03.694 --> 10:05.161
What can you tell us?

10:05.163 --> 10:08.330
On paper, Tara Harris
seems like the average

10:08.332 --> 10:09.665
high school student.

10:09.667 --> 10:11.200
Not all that
impressive grades,

10:11.202 --> 10:13.769
but heavily involved
in social media.

10:13.771 --> 10:16.105
Our technical analyst
is looking into that.

10:16.107 --> 10:18.874
Yeah. She has our entire
I.T. Department tasked

10:18.876 --> 10:20.476
with trying to take the
picture down off the web.

10:20.478 --> 10:22.211
So like you probably
already know.

10:22.213 --> 10:24.480
Well, the Internet
is forever.

10:25.515 --> 10:27.850
Looks like the assailant
got into the open window,

10:27.852 --> 10:29.919
then headed upstairs
to Tara's bedroom.

10:29.921 --> 10:32.955
How did the unsub
know where she lived?

10:32.957 --> 10:33.923
Boom for your boo.

10:33.925 --> 10:35.624
Yeah, baby girl,
did Tara's photos

10:35.626 --> 10:38.227
have GPS markings
in their electronic footprints?

10:38.229 --> 10:41.964
No, but she may as well
have sent an e-vite to the unsub.

10:41.966 --> 10:44.567
She regularly checked in
at a foursquare location

10:44.569 --> 10:47.436
which she tagged
at her home named Harris Ranch.

10:47.438 --> 10:50.239
Did she mention anything
online about her parents being away?

10:50.241 --> 10:52.741
Uh...She said
they grounded her,

10:52.743 --> 10:54.210
left with the car.

10:54.212 --> 10:56.011
Looks like she was
asking her subscribers

10:56.013 --> 10:57.633
to send her video ideas,

10:57.657 --> 10:59.583
ways to wreak havoc
while they were away.

10:59.584 --> 11:02.284
Can you figure out who had
access to Tara's check-ins?

11:02.286 --> 11:04.386
Yeah, but there may be
too many to sort.

11:04.388 --> 11:06.219
Oh, come on, now, you're
my miracle worker, Penelope.

11:06.243 --> 11:07.149
I know you can do it.

11:07.150 --> 11:10.492
Oy, don't write checks
that bounce back.

11:24.841 --> 11:26.842
And she never saw it coming.

11:28.645 --> 11:30.479
The initial blitz
merely stunned her.

11:30.481 --> 11:32.481
The unsub punctured
the victim's abdomen

11:32.483 --> 11:34.116
before lacerating
her throat.

11:34.118 --> 11:36.552
What did he use
to cut her?

11:37.687 --> 11:39.622
A jagged piece of mirror.

11:39.624 --> 11:41.890
A shard from the one
in her bedroom, I assume.

11:41.892 --> 11:43.325
He must have worn gloves,

11:43.327 --> 11:45.261
otherwise his blood
would have been at the scene.

11:45.263 --> 11:46.996
So, did the unsub
think on the fly,

11:46.998 --> 11:49.164
or did he plan on using
the mirror in the attack?

11:49.166 --> 11:51.233
Seems more like a weapon
of opportunity.

11:51.235 --> 11:52.868
But killing with
a symbol of vanity,

11:52.870 --> 11:54.637
that's intentional.

11:54.639 --> 11:56.338
Maybe he brought
a different weapon,

11:56.340 --> 11:58.407
saw the mirror
and couldn't resist.

11:58.409 --> 12:00.042
This killing was planned.

12:00.044 --> 12:02.144
Why deviate
at the last minute?

12:02.146 --> 12:03.946
I don't think he's
as organized as he seems.

12:03.948 --> 12:05.981
Impulsivity could point
to inexperience.

12:05.983 --> 12:08.417
Or maturity.

12:08.419 --> 12:11.620
The unsub could be letting his emotions
dictate his actions.

12:11.622 --> 12:13.622
Yeah. Too cocky
for his own good.

12:13.624 --> 12:17.960
That's when they usually
make mistakes.

12:23.300 --> 12:25.067
We appreciate
your coming in.

12:25.069 --> 12:29.104
And please call us
if you think of anything else.

12:29.106 --> 12:31.106
I promise you that
we will do our best

12:31.108 --> 12:34.510
to find whoever did this
and to bring them to justice.

12:36.012 --> 12:37.146
Sir.

12:37.148 --> 12:39.481
Charles Lorne posted
a selfie with Tara

12:39.483 --> 12:41.617
just hours
before her murder.

12:41.619 --> 12:43.719
He also posted
an inappropriate photo of her

12:43.721 --> 12:45.921
while she was at the mall
yesterday.

12:45.923 --> 12:48.223
Let's have Dave and Kate
pick him up. I'd like to speak to him.

12:48.225 --> 12:50.392
You got it.
Thank you.

12:55.231 --> 12:56.999
Going somewhere, Chuck?

12:57.001 --> 12:59.134
Don't you know by now

12:59.136 --> 13:02.705
that cigarettes
are bad for your health?

13:05.742 --> 13:09.278
I didn't do anything
to Tara. I wouldn't.

13:09.280 --> 13:12.181
You posted illegally
obtained surveillance photos

13:12.183 --> 13:13.282
of her online.

13:13.284 --> 13:14.416
She was my friend.

13:14.418 --> 13:16.085
You told me
you met her yesterday.

13:16.087 --> 13:18.487
And it was like we'd
known each other forever.

13:18.489 --> 13:22.224
Where were you between the hours
10:00 and midnight last night?

13:22.226 --> 13:25.961
At home, with Trixie.

13:25.963 --> 13:27.296
My chihuahua.

13:27.298 --> 13:29.365
Can anyone corroborate
your story?

13:30.633 --> 13:33.035
Trixie can.

13:33.037 --> 13:35.838
Ok, ok, I think
my neighbor saw us,

13:35.840 --> 13:36.905
but I--I didn't--

13:36.907 --> 13:37.907
You stalked Tara.

13:37.908 --> 13:39.641
I didn't do anything wrong.

13:39.643 --> 13:40.876
Actually, you did.

13:40.878 --> 13:43.746
And you will face charges
unless you cooperate.

13:48.852 --> 13:50.119
What do you want to know?

13:50.121 --> 13:53.956
Did you see anyone
with Tara yesterday?

13:53.958 --> 13:57.893
Yeah. And there was
this guy with her.

13:59.562 --> 14:03.031
Total weirdo.

14:03.033 --> 14:05.567
You were the last one
outside of Tara's parents

14:05.569 --> 14:06.835
to see her alive,

14:06.837 --> 14:08.804
and you were the last one
to speak to her.

14:08.806 --> 14:13.776
Do you think he was already
in the house when I called her?

14:13.778 --> 14:15.077
Probably.

14:15.079 --> 14:18.113
Did anyone ever comment
on the amount of selfies

14:18.115 --> 14:19.515
Tara posted online?

14:19.517 --> 14:21.116
Sometimes.

14:21.118 --> 14:22.785
But that was her thing.

14:22.787 --> 14:24.520
Tara was all about Tara.

14:24.522 --> 14:27.623
She wanted to be famous,
Kardashian style.

14:27.625 --> 14:30.626
Do you think someone
held that against her?

14:30.628 --> 14:32.261
I'm sure people
were jealous

14:32.263 --> 14:33.996
of the free swag
she got from sponsors.

14:33.998 --> 14:36.298
But enough to kill her?

14:36.300 --> 14:37.433
I just don't get it.

14:37.435 --> 14:39.635
How did Tara gain
such a following?

14:39.637 --> 14:41.537
She started making
videos of herself

14:41.539 --> 14:43.939
talking about
current events.

14:43.941 --> 14:47.743
She was going to be
the next Jenna Marbles or iJustine.

14:47.745 --> 14:52.648
She attended Vidcom
and other social media conferences

14:52.650 --> 14:54.883
to cross-promote her work
with fellow YouTubers.

14:54.885 --> 14:56.652
Ok, but why
the revealing photos?

14:56.654 --> 15:00.556
She must have known
they'd draw unwanted attention.

15:00.558 --> 15:03.525
Tara didn't believe
in unwanted attention.

15:03.527 --> 15:05.160
The more skin
she showed,

15:05.162 --> 15:07.095
the more followers
she gained.

15:07.097 --> 15:08.964
It was a business to her.

15:08.966 --> 15:12.367
She made money off sponsors
and adds on her sites.

15:12.369 --> 15:15.838
So Tara Harris wasn't just a name,
she was a brand.

15:16.940 --> 15:18.207
I'm interrupting,

15:18.209 --> 15:21.844
but I thought
you should see this.

15:21.846 --> 15:24.480
That's my page.

15:24.482 --> 15:26.482
Yeah.

15:26.484 --> 15:29.518
And this is what
it looked like yesterday.

15:33.857 --> 15:36.558
Why'd you take down
all your selfies, Riley?

15:36.560 --> 15:38.894
It's not what you think.

15:38.896 --> 15:40.662
There's this story.

15:40.664 --> 15:41.930
It's gone viral.

15:41.932 --> 15:44.600
Look, just stop. I don't
want to hear any more. Ok?

15:44.602 --> 15:46.935
What got your panties
in a bunch?

15:46.937 --> 15:48.337
Don't tell me
you're afraid.

15:48.339 --> 15:49.805
That girl was butchered.

15:49.807 --> 15:51.039
No, it was more
than that.

15:51.041 --> 15:53.242
What's wrong?

15:53.244 --> 15:54.743
I just--ok,

15:54.745 --> 15:56.078
I think he's after me, too.

15:56.080 --> 15:58.046
What?

15:58.048 --> 16:00.582
Oh, snap.

16:00.584 --> 16:03.218
You got the Mirror Man.

16:03.220 --> 16:05.521
You must be next.

16:09.559 --> 16:10.526
That's Alexander Chase.

16:10.528 --> 16:14.229
He has close to
150,000 followers.

16:14.231 --> 16:16.999
I bet he gets
all the chicks.

16:17.001 --> 16:19.434
I gotta hit
the gym.

16:19.436 --> 16:20.569
Too late.

16:20.571 --> 16:23.005
That guy was doing squats
in the womb.

16:27.277 --> 16:28.944
Be back at 10:00
to pick you up?

16:28.946 --> 16:29.946
Mm-hmm.

16:29.947 --> 16:31.246
Ok.

16:33.016 --> 16:36.084
Didn't he and Tara Harris make that
challenge vid together?

16:37.720 --> 16:41.290
Dude, what if he's
the killer?

16:42.293 --> 16:44.426
Hey, relax. Ok?

16:44.428 --> 16:46.261
I got one, too.

16:51.034 --> 16:52.501
Did you?

16:52.503 --> 16:55.304
Guess I didn't
make the cut.

16:55.306 --> 16:57.639
Come on, the cut?

16:58.642 --> 17:00.342
That was funny.

17:02.946 --> 17:07.049
So the unsub's putting
these images on people's selfies.

17:07.050 --> 17:08.817
Samuel Clemens,
aka Mark Twain.

17:08.819 --> 17:10.852
A devilish version
of him, anyway.

17:10.854 --> 17:13.755
Interesting choice. The unsub
must have scholarly ambitions,

17:13.757 --> 17:15.624
or at the very least,
he's educated.

17:15.626 --> 17:16.724
Well, the story
on the Internet

17:16.727 --> 17:18.260
is that if you get
a picture like this one,

17:18.262 --> 17:19.560
you're on the killer's
hit list.

17:19.563 --> 17:21.597
Yeah, it's creepy pasta.

17:22.898 --> 17:24.433
Oh, that's Internet slang.

17:24.435 --> 17:26.300
It's a shared story
that expands

17:26.303 --> 17:28.069
as others contribute
to the lore.

17:28.071 --> 17:29.271
Sounds like
an urban legend.

17:29.273 --> 17:31.473
Yeah, or a bastardized
Bloody Mary.

17:31.475 --> 17:34.376
Yeah, same principle,
just with a new technological twist.

17:34.378 --> 17:36.511
So the altered selfies
appear random.

17:36.513 --> 17:39.214
How do we figure out
who the unsub is targeting next?

17:39.216 --> 17:41.216
It's a long shot,
but if the victimology is personal,

17:41.218 --> 17:42.718
the next victim may be someone
connected to Tara.

17:42.720 --> 17:44.786
We should check to see
if any of her friends or family

17:44.788 --> 17:46.288
received doctored images.

17:46.290 --> 17:49.491
In the meantime, can you figure out
who photoshopped these images?

17:49.493 --> 17:50.826
Not yet.
Whoever this guy is,

17:50.828 --> 17:53.095
he's posting to
the users' own accounts.

17:53.097 --> 17:55.897
Well, even someone with minimal
hacking skills can get around a password.

17:55.899 --> 17:57.933
The original photos
had GPS tags,

17:57.935 --> 18:00.469
but the modified ones
are missing that metadata.

18:00.471 --> 18:02.604
Maybe he's using
a cloned cell phone?

18:02.606 --> 18:04.272
The unsub's trying
to make a name for himself.

18:04.274 --> 18:07.309
Oh, "Selfie Killer" is already all over
the social media sites,

18:07.311 --> 18:09.311
and some late night
talk show hosts

18:09.313 --> 18:10.879
have even taken on
the mantle.

18:10.881 --> 18:12.748
Yeah, well, an ice bucket
challenge this isn't.

18:12.750 --> 18:13.715
So what's his end game?

18:13.717 --> 18:15.817
Fear.
Fame.

18:15.819 --> 18:16.785
Probably both.

18:16.787 --> 18:18.587
He's a sadist
and he's enjoying

18:18.589 --> 18:20.222
the panic he's creating.

18:34.571 --> 18:37.572
♪ For which I'd like
to thank you ♪

18:37.574 --> 18:40.575
♪ we were too proud
for you all ♪

18:40.577 --> 18:44.246
♪ big house, small shoes,
and now-- ♪

19:17.665 --> 19:19.299
The Vic was
Alexander Chase,

19:19.301 --> 19:20.834
another Internet
wannabe.

19:20.836 --> 19:23.336
The unsub clearly has a type.
He's making a statement

19:23.338 --> 19:25.038
about people who put
their lives online.

19:25.040 --> 19:28.642
Well, at first glance, victimology could
be about their social media presence,

19:28.644 --> 19:31.745
but this is also the same mall Tara
visited before she was murdered.

19:31.747 --> 19:34.014
Alexander's girlfriend
works here.

19:34.016 --> 19:37.317
She doesn't have a car,
so he regularly drives her to and from.

19:37.319 --> 19:38.952
The unsub
probably knew that.

19:38.954 --> 19:40.954
A neighbor corroborates
that Charles Lorne,

19:40.956 --> 19:42.756
the sporting goods
store security guard,

19:42.758 --> 19:45.725
was seen walking his dog
the night that Tara was murdered.

19:45.727 --> 19:47.193
So we know it wasn't him.

19:47.195 --> 19:49.996
Yeah, but it doesn't rule out
a local who frequents the mall.

19:49.998 --> 19:51.665
Or somebody
that works here.

19:51.667 --> 19:53.333
Did he post
another selfie?

19:53.335 --> 19:56.336
Yeah. But he upped
his game.

19:56.338 --> 19:58.872
"Fear Me."
Hashtag Mirrorman.

19:58.874 --> 20:00.340
Well, the guy
named himself.

20:00.342 --> 20:03.877
Guess he didn't like
being called the selfie killer.

20:06.013 --> 20:07.480
Go for greatness.

20:07.482 --> 20:10.116
Hey, Garcia, the killer
posted another selfie.

20:10.118 --> 20:12.752
Does "Mirror Man"
get you anything?

20:12.754 --> 20:14.521
Mirror Man.

20:15.723 --> 20:17.324
Whoa.

20:17.326 --> 20:18.358
Does it ever.

20:18.360 --> 20:22.195
Mirror Man-Ia
is a scary place to surf.

20:22.197 --> 20:25.265
I will grab a shovel
and I will start digging.

20:25.267 --> 20:26.766
All right, thanks, Pen.

20:26.768 --> 20:29.069
It's hard to sneak up
on somebody in a convertible.

20:29.071 --> 20:31.404
And he changed
his murder weapon, too.

20:31.406 --> 20:33.073
Alexander was killed
with a nail gun.

20:33.075 --> 20:36.576
Why switch? I thought these guys
liked using the same kill method.

20:36.578 --> 20:38.912
Maybe he planned on killing Tara
with a nail gun, too,

20:38.914 --> 20:40.347
and saw the mirror
and got distracted.

20:40.349 --> 20:41.982
I mean,
given his moniker,

20:41.984 --> 20:44.751
maybe it was an ironic twist
he couldn't pass up.

20:46.621 --> 20:47.954
Hey, guys.

20:47.956 --> 20:50.957
Take a look at this.

20:56.063 --> 20:59.532
I think it's time
to deliver the profile.

20:59.534 --> 21:02.068
We believe that the man
we're looking for

21:02.070 --> 21:03.737
is a narcissistic sadist

21:03.739 --> 21:06.206
who is blitzing his victims
with weapons of opportunity.

21:06.208 --> 21:09.075
He sees these weapons as
symbols of his victims' vanity.

21:09.077 --> 21:12.145
First the mirror, then nails
in the form of a hashtag.

21:12.147 --> 21:15.348
It's popular method of topic tagging
on social media sites.

21:15.350 --> 21:17.651
These murders
are a statement.

21:17.653 --> 21:19.619
Based on
the organization

21:19.621 --> 21:21.287
and sophistication
of the crimes,

21:21.289 --> 21:23.390
we put this unsub in his late
30s to early 40s.

21:23.392 --> 21:25.258
This guy's trying to make
a name for himself

21:25.260 --> 21:27.761
by building off the Internet
legend of the Mirror Man.

21:27.763 --> 21:29.229
It's a form of ostension,

21:29.231 --> 21:31.231
when someone does the acts
described in a story

21:31.233 --> 21:32.699
in order to bring them
to life.

21:32.701 --> 21:34.567
We've seen it before
with the poisoning of Halloween candy

21:34.569 --> 21:36.536
and most recently
with the Slenderman case

21:36.538 --> 21:38.038
in Wisconsin earlier this year.

21:38.040 --> 21:40.407
That's the case where two girls
stabbed their best friend

21:40.409 --> 21:41.574
because they believed
in doing so,

21:41.576 --> 21:43.443
they would become proxies
of a mystical being.

21:43.445 --> 21:45.445
Also known as
legend tripping.

21:45.447 --> 21:48.081
The unsub assumes the mantle
of an established story,

21:48.083 --> 21:49.916
then brings it to life
in his own way

21:49.918 --> 21:53.486
by recreating the circumstances
described in that lore.

21:53.488 --> 21:55.922
In one version,
the Mirror Man kills

21:55.924 --> 21:57.390
by showing you
your refection.

21:57.392 --> 22:00.727
In another, he spears you
with his razor-sharp fingernails

22:00.729 --> 22:03.296
if you capture
his reflection in a picture.

22:03.298 --> 22:04.664
Hence the nail gun.

22:04.666 --> 22:08.034
He's becoming immortal
as the stories and legends grow,

22:08.036 --> 22:10.503
fueling him
to only act again.

22:10.505 --> 22:13.506
This unsub probably lacks in
professional and social graces

22:13.508 --> 22:15.709
and is most likely
subservient to his peers,

22:15.711 --> 22:17.811
although he doesn't
view it that way.

22:17.813 --> 22:19.979
His need for attention
probably stems from abandonment

22:19.981 --> 22:21.147
in early childhood.

22:21.149 --> 22:23.216
And he's tech proficient,
among other things.

22:23.218 --> 22:26.720
He photoshopped this image
onto the victims' photos.

22:26.722 --> 22:29.956
His distortion of Mark Twain
as the face of the Mirror Man,

22:29.958 --> 22:31.224
it's very important.

22:31.226 --> 22:33.059
William Faulkner
described Mark Twain

22:33.061 --> 22:34.661
as the father
of American literature,

22:34.663 --> 22:36.730
and this unsub sees
himself similarly.

22:36.732 --> 22:39.399
He wants to become
the forefather of modern lore.

22:39.401 --> 22:42.602
He'll be monitoring web traffic,
media sites, and chat rooms

22:42.604 --> 22:46.840
as he enjoys the panic
and hysteria created by his crimes.

22:51.946 --> 22:53.346
Fear this,

22:53.348 --> 22:55.815
mirror bitch.

22:55.817 --> 23:00.120
Fear this, mirror bitch.

23:00.122 --> 23:02.522
Fear this, mirror bitch.

23:10.898 --> 23:13.666
I'm hoping to be home
late tonight.

23:13.668 --> 23:15.101
I know.

23:15.103 --> 23:16.903
Ok.

23:16.905 --> 23:18.404
Hey.

23:18.406 --> 23:20.340
I love you.

23:27.982 --> 23:29.115
What?

23:29.117 --> 23:31.251
You owe that woman
something spectacular

23:31.253 --> 23:32.685
when this is all over.

23:32.687 --> 23:35.588
Ah, Penelope, look,
that was the plan, I swear.

23:35.590 --> 23:38.558
Work. It always seems
to get in the way.

23:38.560 --> 23:40.760
Well, I don't buy it.

23:40.762 --> 23:42.395
I know you.

23:42.397 --> 23:44.364
There's gotta be
some kind of balance.

23:44.366 --> 23:45.832
You both save lives
for a living.

23:45.834 --> 23:48.368
If anyone understands
our crazy hours, it's her.

23:50.070 --> 23:53.106
Ok, Oprah,
what do I do?

23:53.108 --> 23:55.508
Stop making big plans.

23:55.510 --> 23:57.944
Commit to something
you can actually make happen.

23:57.946 --> 24:01.181
It's the littlest gestures
that go the longest ways.

24:01.183 --> 24:04.617
Trust me. When I'm grumpy,
Sam does this Dalek impersonation.

24:04.619 --> 24:06.820
He stretches his arms out
like a Cyberman, which makes no sense,

24:06.822 --> 24:09.122
but it delights me.
My point is, do something to delight her.

24:09.124 --> 24:10.857
Ok, I'm done. Back to
this Mirror Man story.

24:10.859 --> 24:14.160
There are so many versions to it,
I can't tell which one is the right one.

24:14.162 --> 24:16.596
All right, just breathe.

24:16.598 --> 24:18.898
Let's do what we do.

24:18.900 --> 24:20.033
Hey.

24:20.035 --> 24:23.403
My cross-referencing
cuticles

24:23.405 --> 24:25.338
stand ready to serve you.

24:25.340 --> 24:28.708
Ok. Run a list
of male workers at the mall

24:28.710 --> 24:30.577
who were off the night
of the two murders.

24:30.579 --> 24:31.711
Keep it coming.

24:31.713 --> 24:33.313
All right, cross that
with persons fitting

24:33.315 --> 24:34.747
the projected
age demographic.

24:34.749 --> 24:37.617
I always forget how good
you are at this.

24:37.619 --> 24:39.352
Ok, now cross that list
with the people who reposted

24:39.354 --> 24:42.088
any of the dead victims' pics or
made comments about the Mirror Man

24:42.090 --> 24:43.323
in the last 24 hours.

24:43.325 --> 24:45.124
Ok, we're getting somewhere.

24:45.126 --> 24:46.726
All right, Garcia,
we gotta run deep into the lives

24:46.728 --> 24:47.927
of the people
on that list.

24:47.929 --> 24:49.963
There's a good chance
one of them is our unsub.

24:49.965 --> 24:51.698
How much time
do we have.

24:51.700 --> 24:53.566
Well,
this unsub's killed

24:53.568 --> 24:56.135
the last two nights
in a row.

24:56.137 --> 24:58.705
With the media sensation
surrounding these crimes,

24:58.707 --> 25:01.107
I highly doubt he's gonna
take tonight off.

25:01.109 --> 25:03.409
Ok, so no time.

25:41.615 --> 25:42.615
Wait, wait!

25:42.617 --> 25:44.217
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

25:44.219 --> 25:45.251
Please, please, please,
please!

25:45.253 --> 25:46.552
Please--

25:55.381 --> 25:57.882
Daniel Osbourne,
recent high school graduate,

25:57.884 --> 26:00.351
worked at Bethesda
Fashion Square.

26:00.353 --> 26:01.886
That confirms
our mall theory.

26:01.888 --> 26:04.222
There's no indication
he knew Tara Harris,

26:04.224 --> 26:07.825
but he did follow
Alexander Chase online.

26:07.827 --> 26:12.096
Nail gun again. Looks like this unsub
has found his weapon of choice.

26:12.098 --> 26:15.400
Look at his face.
This is mutilation.

26:15.402 --> 26:17.535
Overkill
indicative of rage.

26:17.537 --> 26:21.272
Unlike that displayed
in the previous two murders.

26:21.274 --> 26:23.308
Point me toward the perp.

26:23.310 --> 26:25.610
Garcia, I need you
to check on Daniel Osbourne's

26:25.612 --> 26:28.146
social media activity. Does anything
indicate the same kind of vanity

26:28.148 --> 26:30.481
as seen in the other
victims?

26:30.483 --> 26:33.851
Mm...Nothing so self-involved.

26:36.021 --> 26:40.058
Fear this, mirror bitch.

26:40.060 --> 26:42.493
Fear this, mirror bitch.

26:42.495 --> 26:46.898
His last post was a taunt
to the Mirror Man, though.

26:46.900 --> 26:48.333
All right, thanks.

26:48.335 --> 26:51.769
Apparently the unsub
didn't like Daniel's mocking tone.

26:51.771 --> 26:53.371
So he silenced his heckler.

26:53.373 --> 26:56.374
This could point to a devolution
in the unsub's psyche.

26:56.376 --> 26:57.709
He's no longer interested
in murdering people

26:57.711 --> 26:59.377
as an example
of how great he is.

26:59.379 --> 27:00.912
He's murdering those
who make fun of him.

27:00.914 --> 27:03.448
We may need to lower
our original age estimate.

27:03.450 --> 27:05.183
Good point, Aaron.

27:05.185 --> 27:06.818
This is almost
tantrum-like.

27:06.820 --> 27:09.754
This unsub could be
a teenager.

27:11.290 --> 27:14.192
Yes, yes, and yes, yes.

27:14.194 --> 27:15.393
What'd you find, mama?

27:15.395 --> 27:17.628
Ok, factoring in
a younger age demographic

27:17.630 --> 27:20.932
with mall--thank you--
employees that fit the profile

27:20.934 --> 27:23.334
and weren't working
on the nights of the murders,

27:23.336 --> 27:25.503
I have narrowed it down
to one promising standout.

27:25.505 --> 27:28.639
Connor Holt. He is a senior
at Sunnydale high,

27:28.641 --> 27:30.108
and he posts about
the Mirror Man a lot.

27:30.110 --> 27:31.476
When did he start?

27:31.478 --> 27:33.478
A year ago. And not only
does this young man

27:33.480 --> 27:36.647
work at a hardware store
giving him primo access to nail guns,

27:36.649 --> 27:39.317
he also has a juvie record,
and he goes to the same high school

27:39.319 --> 27:41.397
Daniel Osbourne attended.
I'm sending it to your phones.

27:41.421 --> 27:42.855
You're welcome.

27:42.856 --> 27:44.889
Your majesty.
You are the best.

27:44.891 --> 27:46.657
I'm a reflection of you.

27:51.463 --> 27:52.997
Whoa! What the hell's
going on?

27:52.999 --> 27:55.033
Upstairs.
Where's Connor's room?

27:55.035 --> 27:56.234
What is this about?

27:56.236 --> 27:57.702
I'll be happy to explain

27:57.704 --> 27:59.670
if you'll
just follow me, sir.

28:05.477 --> 28:07.512
FBI. Stay where you are,
Connor.

28:07.514 --> 28:08.980
Don't shoot. I surrender.

28:08.982 --> 28:11.349
Let's go.
Please.

28:32.538 --> 28:34.138
I didn't do it.

28:34.140 --> 28:37.141
Then how do you explain your obsession
with the Mirror Man, Connor?

28:37.143 --> 28:39.577
For someone who claims not to be him,
you sure spend a great deal of time

28:39.579 --> 28:40.978
caught up in his life.

28:40.980 --> 28:44.682
Look, the Mirror Man
is me, but I didn't kill anyone.

28:44.684 --> 28:47.085
I created him, ok?
I'm a writer.

28:47.087 --> 28:49.053
I--I wanted to make
a new urban legend

28:49.055 --> 28:50.521
because I love
horror stories.

28:50.523 --> 28:52.056
This isn't a story, Connor.
This is real.

28:52.058 --> 28:53.291
People are dying.

28:53.293 --> 28:55.059
No, I didn't want that!

28:55.061 --> 28:57.628
Nobody sits around
a campfire like they used to

28:57.630 --> 28:59.831
'cause nobody ever unplugs.

28:59.833 --> 29:03.067
I wanted to create a--
a modern day bogeyman.

29:07.206 --> 29:10.341
Then why alter
the victims' photos, hmm?

29:10.343 --> 29:11.609
What?

29:11.611 --> 29:13.010
You must have known
that the photoshopped pictures

29:13.012 --> 29:14.045
were of people being killed.

29:14.047 --> 29:15.480
No, no, no.
That's wasn't me.

29:15.482 --> 29:17.148
I can't even use
Photoshop.

29:17.150 --> 29:18.182
A lot of people I know
got doctored pics--

29:18.184 --> 29:20.451
But not you.
No, not me.

29:20.453 --> 29:22.286
Why do you think that is?

29:22.288 --> 29:26.324
Because whoever's taken my story
doesn't want me to stop telling it.

29:32.297 --> 29:33.364
Kate.

29:33.366 --> 29:35.233
Yeah, what is it?

29:35.235 --> 29:36.200
Look at this.

29:36.202 --> 29:37.935
It's a poem
about the Mirror Man.

29:40.506 --> 29:46.377
Well-authored. This guys knows
his iambic pentameter.

29:46.379 --> 29:47.545
Wait a minute.

29:47.547 --> 29:48.846
You see it, too?

29:48.848 --> 29:51.482
Yeah, he switches syntax,
the grammar's messy,

29:51.484 --> 29:52.850
then he used an emoticon?

29:52.852 --> 29:55.486
Nothing else points
to this level of immaturity.

29:55.488 --> 29:58.656
Connor wasn't the only one developing
the Mirror Man legend.

30:00.659 --> 30:02.660
You can't just
leave me in here.

30:02.662 --> 30:05.696
I get a phone call
and a lawyer or something.

30:05.698 --> 30:06.698
Hello! Anybody here?

30:06.699 --> 30:08.866
Hey!

30:08.868 --> 30:11.135
Stop yelling.

30:20.879 --> 30:25.616
Connor, you don't need
a lawyer. You're innocent.

30:25.618 --> 30:27.218
You believe me?

30:27.220 --> 30:28.786
Yeah. I do.

30:28.788 --> 30:32.423
But we need your help to find
the real killer, and you know him.

30:32.425 --> 30:34.525
Yes, you do.
I don't know anything, man.

30:34.527 --> 30:36.227
You do. Just listen to me.

30:36.229 --> 30:39.697
We think the unsub decided
to bring your story to life.

30:39.699 --> 30:43.000
He may look up to you.

30:43.002 --> 30:45.636
He's probably younger
than you.

30:45.638 --> 30:48.739
He may have aided
in the development of the legend.

30:48.741 --> 30:50.041
He's a quiet boy.

30:50.043 --> 30:53.377
Clings to his friends
because they're all he has.

30:53.379 --> 30:55.913
He may have recently
suffered abandonment by a loved one

30:55.915 --> 30:57.882
or lost someone
very close to him.

30:57.884 --> 31:00.785
This neighborhood
has been rocked...

31:05.791 --> 31:09.227
William Pratt.

31:09.229 --> 31:10.962
He's a junior.

31:10.964 --> 31:13.030
Parents died in a car
accident last year.

31:13.032 --> 31:14.632
He's been messed up
ever since.

31:14.634 --> 31:17.501
The death of William's parents
probably triggered a psychosis.

31:17.503 --> 31:20.171
Idolization of a dominant role model
in the wake of tragedy

31:20.173 --> 31:22.673
could often blur the lines
between right and wrong.

31:22.675 --> 31:23.829
Like Slenderman.

31:23.853 --> 31:26.660
Childhood imagination took
precedence over social norms.

31:26.746 --> 31:27.746
I'll tell Hotch.

31:27.747 --> 31:29.146
I'll tell Garcia.

31:30.415 --> 31:32.783
Agent Morgan.

31:32.785 --> 31:35.319
Is this my fault?

31:40.659 --> 31:45.663
He looked up to you when there
was no one else to look up to.

31:45.665 --> 31:48.432
I think he probably saw your obsession
with the Mirror Man legend

31:48.434 --> 31:50.768
and just decided
to bring it to life.

31:54.273 --> 31:56.073
So it is my fault.

31:56.075 --> 31:59.243
Sometimes people's wires
just get crossed up, Connor.

31:59.245 --> 32:02.613
It's tragic, but it happens.

32:02.615 --> 32:05.016
This was not your fault.

32:05.018 --> 32:08.019
It looks like William
splits his time

32:08.021 --> 32:09.587
between school,
his aunt's house,

32:09.589 --> 32:11.622
and working a kiosk
at the mall.

32:11.624 --> 32:13.157
Dave, have Rosenburg
meet you at the school,

32:13.159 --> 32:14.659
JJ and Kate, grab Morgan
and head to the mall.

32:14.661 --> 32:16.427
Reid and I will go
to the aunt's house.

32:16.429 --> 32:18.629
I'm sending coordinates
and pictures directly to your phones.

32:18.631 --> 32:20.798
Thank you, Garcia.
Yeah.

33:01.039 --> 33:02.006
Move!

33:02.008 --> 33:04.375
Aah!
FBI!

33:04.377 --> 33:05.776
Drop the weapon!

33:05.778 --> 33:07.144
Put that weapon down!

33:07.146 --> 33:08.479
Let her go, William.

33:08.481 --> 33:10.314
Stay back. I don't want
to hurt her, but I will.

33:10.316 --> 33:11.949
And then what?
You hurt her, we hurt you.

33:11.951 --> 33:13.317
Is that what you want?

33:13.319 --> 33:16.520
All right, where's Connor?
I need to see Connor right now.

33:16.522 --> 33:18.522
Connor's back at our office.
You put that nail gun down,

33:18.524 --> 33:20.224
we'll take you right to him.

33:20.226 --> 33:22.493
No, you're trying
to trick me.

33:22.495 --> 33:26.797
No. No trick. Ok?

33:26.799 --> 33:29.467
We're here to help you,
William, ok?

33:29.469 --> 33:33.504
Connor, your aunt,
we're all just here to help you.

33:33.506 --> 33:35.873
I'm not getting out
of this, am I?

33:35.875 --> 33:37.908
That's entirely up to you.

33:40.011 --> 33:41.412
Here they are!

33:41.414 --> 33:43.914
Get out, get out.

33:43.916 --> 33:45.416
Go!

33:45.418 --> 33:46.817
Oh, God.

33:46.819 --> 33:48.586
Yes, sir.
Ready to roll.

33:48.588 --> 33:50.121
Ok, ok.

33:50.123 --> 33:52.356
They're giving him
an audience.

33:52.358 --> 33:53.591
Get back!

33:53.593 --> 33:56.794
Get back! Go!

33:57.796 --> 33:59.764
Stay with him.

34:05.337 --> 34:07.405
Medic!
We need a medic now!

34:07.407 --> 34:10.107
What the hell
were you thinking?!

34:26.913 --> 34:30.181
Pulse is thready
and BP's dropping.

34:34.388 --> 34:38.389
Radio Bethesda. Let them know we have
a pediatric gunshot wound.

34:43.029 --> 34:46.465
Hey, it's me.
Listen, I need your help.

34:48.400 --> 34:49.735
We'll do everything
we can.

34:49.737 --> 34:51.704
Move him to bed 6.
Let's hear some stats.

34:51.706 --> 34:54.773
Single GSW to the thorax.
BP's 90 over 50 and dropping.

34:54.775 --> 34:55.841
He's lost a lot of blood.

34:55.842 --> 34:57.243
We need two units
of O-neg.

34:57.245 --> 34:59.245
Tell trauma surgery
we have incoming.

34:59.247 --> 35:01.180
Right away.
Coming through.

35:37.984 --> 35:39.918
There should have been
another way, Hotch.

35:39.920 --> 35:42.454
Kate filled me in.
She said the shot was clean.

35:42.456 --> 35:44.023
How's the victim?

35:44.025 --> 35:46.225
No word yet,
on either of them.

35:46.227 --> 35:48.327
I shot a kid
on national television.

35:48.329 --> 35:49.995
You shot a serial killer.

35:49.997 --> 35:53.032
And if you hadn't, the hostage wouldn't
be in surgery, she'd be dead.

35:53.034 --> 35:55.868
You did the right thing.

36:04.878 --> 36:07.746
The female victim
is coming out of surgery now

36:07.748 --> 36:09.882
and the surgeon expects her
to make a full recovery.

36:09.884 --> 36:10.884
And the boy?

36:10.885 --> 36:11.850
He lost a lot of blood

36:11.852 --> 36:13.218
and there's
some nerve damage,

36:13.220 --> 36:14.553
but he'll survive.

36:17.757 --> 36:19.391
Thank you.

36:37.510 --> 36:39.478
Is he gonna be ok?

36:41.548 --> 36:44.216
I think with your help
he might.

36:56.096 --> 36:57.730
There he is.

37:00.800 --> 37:02.234
You're gonna be famous,
Connor.

37:02.236 --> 37:04.336
You, me, and your story.

37:05.772 --> 37:07.873
I never asked for this.

37:09.776 --> 37:11.677
We're gonna live forever.

37:11.679 --> 37:14.213
You're going to jail.

37:14.215 --> 37:17.316
Yeah, but, I mean,
for how long, though?

37:17.318 --> 37:22.087
The kids do the craziest
things, right?

37:24.391 --> 37:26.091
Hey, wait.

37:26.093 --> 37:28.761
Um, can I see your cell phone?

37:40.840 --> 37:43.609
No one will ever believe
I got shot.

37:55.188 --> 37:58.157
What is this?

37:58.159 --> 38:01.360
You are coming with me.

38:01.362 --> 38:02.561
Where to.

38:02.563 --> 38:04.596
I told you we were
gonna take a trip.

38:04.598 --> 38:06.165
I haven't packed.

38:06.167 --> 38:08.901
This Ia trip you don't need to pack for,
at least not yet.

38:08.903 --> 38:10.903
Now, why don't you stop
asking so many questions.

38:10.905 --> 38:13.205
Why don't you stop
bossing me around.

38:27.520 --> 38:30.422
Wait. Isn't this the house
you've been restoring?

38:30.424 --> 38:31.623
Come on.

38:31.625 --> 38:33.559
What is going on?

38:33.561 --> 38:34.593
Just come on.

38:34.595 --> 38:36.128
Derek.
Ok.

38:37.264 --> 38:40.432
Savannnah, it's really
important to me

38:40.434 --> 38:43.202
that you know
that I'm not all talk.

38:44.604 --> 38:46.572
Welcome to our permanent
vacation.

38:49.442 --> 38:52.444
Just think about it
like this.

38:52.446 --> 38:54.379
The world needs
both of us.

38:54.381 --> 38:58.183
And there's really nothing
we can do about it.

38:58.185 --> 39:01.987
But we need each other
just the same, Savannah.

39:01.989 --> 39:03.989
I know I need you.

39:03.991 --> 39:07.059
What we do is important
to each of us,

39:07.061 --> 39:11.063
but this, it can be...

39:11.065 --> 39:15.067
Our own little
fortress of solitude.

39:15.069 --> 39:17.202
Just you and me.

39:18.838 --> 39:20.739
This is for us?

39:20.741 --> 39:23.175
Is you're game?

39:23.177 --> 39:29.314
Living next door to each other is not
working for me anymore.

39:35.355 --> 39:38.123
What do you think?

39:41.794 --> 39:44.296
I think I love you.

39:45.532 --> 39:47.633
I love you.

40:03.851 --> 40:05.551
Welcome home.

40:09.656 --> 40:10.822
Mmm.

40:11.825 --> 40:14.993
Oh, no.

40:17.498 --> 40:20.566
Hmm.

40:23.136 --> 40:26.438
This is Dr. Hayes.
This is Derek Morgan.

40:26.440 --> 40:27.472
Ok.

40:27.474 --> 40:30.108
All right.
I got it.

40:43.156 --> 40:46.692
"There is a fellowship
more quiet even than solitude,

40:46.694 --> 40:51.196
and which rightly understood,
is solitude made perfect."
