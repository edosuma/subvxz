16:21.512 --> 16:23.595
Now, I heard you
trying to scream.

16:27.470 --> 16:29.345
- Look, why...

16:29.428 --> 16:32.762
...you want to get Daddy
into trouble?

16:42.512 --> 16:46.845
When I first saw you...

16:46.929 --> 16:50.178
you reminded me
of my very first crush...

16:52.136 --> 16:54.845
Sophia Boyden.

16:54.929 --> 16:58.804
Oh, she was so damn...

16:58.887 --> 17:01.136
pretty.

17:01.970 --> 17:04.011
You know what I loved
about her the most?

17:06.720 --> 17:08.345
Her hair.

17:09.970 --> 17:12.970
It was just like yours...

17:13.053 --> 17:15.470
soft and...

17:15.553 --> 17:18.053
and natural.

17:18.136 --> 17:21.720
All I wanted to do
was be with her.

17:23.720 --> 17:27.887
Run my fingers
through her hair.

17:27.970 --> 17:31.470
So I asked her out
on a date...

17:34.220 --> 17:36.178
...and she rejected me.

17:39.595 --> 17:43.011
Said she preferred some guy
on the football team.

17:46.011 --> 17:47.553
Soon enough, she got him.

17:49.637 --> 17:54.387
Then she started
flaunting her hair...

17:54.470 --> 17:57.011
wearing shorter skirts.

17:59.762 --> 18:04.095
Always had the buttons
of her blouse...

18:04.178 --> 18:05.261
open.

18:08.929 --> 18:11.345
Next thing you know,
she started serving it up

18:11.428 --> 18:13.428
to every nigga on the block.

18:15.762 --> 18:17.553
She was a whore.

18:20.178 --> 18:23.804
She ended up
getting pregnant...

18:23.887 --> 18:25.512
fat,

18:25.595 --> 18:27.303
and on welfare.

18:33.387 --> 18:35.553
I couldn't save her.

18:40.136 --> 18:42.470
But I can save you.

18:45.804 --> 18:47.720
I can save you.

18:49.595 --> 18:51.220
I can save you.

18:54.512 --> 18:56.095
I can save you.

19:39.011 --> 19:41.261
What's the emergency?
I got somewhere to be.

19:41.345 --> 19:43.470
- Where the stash at?
- What stash?

19:43.553 --> 19:45.220
- Don't lie to me, bro.
- I ain't lying.

19:45.303 --> 19:47.762
Look, Reg told me
he had 50 grand stashed away

19:47.845 --> 19:50.261
in the house somewhere
in case of an emergency,

19:50.345 --> 19:53.762
and getting custody of your ass
is a fucking emergency.

19:53.845 --> 19:55.387
Reg ain't never had
no money.

19:55.470 --> 19:57.095
He told me he did.

19:57.178 --> 20:01.053
Well, he lying,
'cause that nigga stayed broke.

20:01.136 --> 20:02.303
Can I go now?

20:02.387 --> 20:03.679
It's Kev's birthday,
and we throwing

20:03.762 --> 20:05.053
a surprise party
for him later.

20:05.136 --> 20:08.387
You little niggas, man,
y'all real spoiled.

20:08.470 --> 20:10.387
I ain't never had
no birthday party.

20:10.470 --> 20:12.387
I was just happy
to be alive.

20:12.470 --> 20:14.929
Me and his girl gonna kick it
with him

20:15.011 --> 20:15.929
till it's time
for the surprise.

20:16.011 --> 20:17.804
You like his girl, don't you?

20:17.887 --> 20:19.762
Hell, no!
I can't stand that girl.

20:19.845 --> 20:22.970
Uh-huh.
That usually means you do.

20:23.053 --> 20:25.637
She think she all
that and better than everybody

20:25.720 --> 20:27.095
'cause her daddy got money.

20:27.178 --> 20:29.178
Man, having money
don't mean shit.

20:29.261 --> 20:31.345
Well, maybe if you had some,
you wouldn't be staying

20:31.428 --> 20:33.095
in our dead brother's
trap house.

20:40.303 --> 20:42.178
Look, man, I'm--I'm doing
what I got to do

20:42.261 --> 20:44.470
to make sure you live
a good life.

20:44.553 --> 20:46.845
- I'm good where I'm at.
- No, you not.

20:46.929 --> 20:49.136
- Says who?
- Me, that's who.

20:49.220 --> 20:51.178
...Otis Perry's
mother, Opal Perry.

20:51.261 --> 20:52.637
Man, turn that shit up.

20:52.720 --> 20:54.679
Otis "Douda" Perry
is not a politician.

20:54.762 --> 20:57.595
He sells pizzas and calls
himself a businessman.

20:57.679 --> 20:59.762
Now, I could rattle off the--

20:59.845 --> 21:02.136
the statistics
of his three failed businesses

21:02.220 --> 21:04.970
or remind you of the fact
that his current franchise

21:05.053 --> 21:06.387
is drowning in debt,

21:06.470 --> 21:08.220
but the Internet will do
most of that for you.

21:08.303 --> 21:10.553
And how do you feel
about Otis Perry's promise

21:10.637 --> 21:12.387
to the working people
of Chicago?

21:12.470 --> 21:14.220
Otis "Douda" Perry
has never cared

21:14.303 --> 21:16.220
about anything but himself.

21:16.303 --> 21:18.512
He's not in this election
to help people.

21:18.595 --> 21:21.303
He's here to--to gain power
and money.

21:21.387 --> 21:24.011
He ain't  .
He never will be  .

21:24.095 --> 21:27.553
And I know.
I'm his mother.

21:27.637 --> 21:29.428
You can't pick your children,

21:29.512 --> 21:32.178
but you can pick your mayor,

21:32.261 --> 21:34.095
and I am endorsing

21:34.178 --> 21:36.512
Camille Hallaway.

21:36.595 --> 21:38.303
There you have it.

21:38.387 --> 21:40.887
- Very strong words--

21:40.970 --> 21:44.011
I hate that bitch.

21:44.095 --> 21:45.428
Careful.
She's still my mother.

21:45.512 --> 21:48.553
She just endorsed
your fucking opponent.

21:48.637 --> 21:51.428
You gonna have to make
a statement or something.

21:51.512 --> 21:53.762
We need to just be quiet
and...

21:53.845 --> 21:55.136
and let this die down.

21:55.220 --> 21:56.887
It's not your brand
to be quiet.

21:56.970 --> 21:58.762
Shut up!

22:03.011 --> 22:06.095
I'm not responding.

22:06.178 --> 22:10.220
She is crazy.
She always has been.

22:10.303 --> 22:12.637
We just need to let
this shit pass.

22:23.178 --> 22:24.261
Rose...

22:26.178 --> 22:29.011
Do not engage
with that bullshit.

22:45.261 --> 22:46.887
Don't get too fucked up,

22:46.970 --> 22:48.387
'cause I ain't carrying you
out of here.

22:48.470 --> 22:50.637
He'll be fine.

22:50.720 --> 22:52.220
- I made this strain myself.

22:52.303 --> 22:53.762
I mean,
that shit will fuck you up.

22:53.845 --> 22:57.303
Like, it's gas, but you can
still function, you know?

22:57.387 --> 22:59.762
It's the only way I got
through all my corporate jobs.

22:59.845 --> 23:03.095
A cubicle ain't nothing
but a jail cell.

23:03.178 --> 23:04.428
I'm good.

23:08.679 --> 23:13.345
Ooh...

23:13.428 --> 23:15.345
ooh.

23:15.428 --> 23:18.178
Mm, go on,
change your life.

23:18.261 --> 23:20.136
Change your whole thing.

23:23.762 --> 23:25.261
What is he d--

23:27.095 --> 23:29.220
That shit good, ain't it?

23:31.637 --> 23:33.512
- This shit spiritual.

23:33.595 --> 23:35.679
I got this shit
from my private stash.

23:35.762 --> 23:39.011
I figured since you, uh,
was cool with my cousin,

23:39.095 --> 23:40.637
I'll let you take some home.

23:40.720 --> 23:42.428
Uh...

23:42.512 --> 23:43.762
actually, I-I appreciate it,

23:43.845 --> 23:45.804
but it's got me thinking.

23:45.887 --> 23:48.512
Oh, talk to me.
Talk to me.

23:48.595 --> 23:50.595
Maybe instead of giving me
this ounce,

23:50.679 --> 23:52.303
we pay full price on it,

23:52.387 --> 23:53.720
and you think
about cutting Tiff, like,

23:53.804 --> 23:55.261
a volume discount
on her purchase.

23:55.345 --> 23:56.720
No!

23:56.804 --> 23:58.553
I don't do volume discounts
for nobody.

23:58.637 --> 23:59.929
What you think this is?
I don't want my customers

24:00.011 --> 24:01.720
stocking up on my product

24:01.804 --> 24:03.387
and then becoming
my competition.

24:03.470 --> 24:04.387
- I'm not--
- Tiff ain't trying

24:04.470 --> 24:05.679
to compete with you.

24:05.762 --> 24:07.679
She can actually bring you
more business

24:07.762 --> 24:11.220
and sell your specialty strain
for a premium price.

24:11.303 --> 24:12.512
It's true.

24:12.595 --> 24:14.679
Y'all both win.

24:14.762 --> 24:17.887
Now, why are niggas
always trying to hustle?

24:19.303 --> 24:21.804
This ain't a hustle.
It's just good business.

24:21.887 --> 24:23.345
Mm-hmm.
Good business.

24:23.428 --> 24:25.220
Shit.

24:26.970 --> 24:28.428
If I can...
Okay.

24:28.512 --> 24:30.553
Cut in half,
put it in fifths.

24:30.637 --> 24:32.887
Carry the one.
It's not a leap year.

24:32.970 --> 24:34.303
15%...

24:36.470 --> 24:38.053
All right.

24:38.136 --> 24:39.303
You got a deal.

24:39.387 --> 24:41.845
All right.

24:41.929 --> 24:45.679
Let's toast up, light-skins.
Toast up.

24:45.762 --> 24:48.136
- Eh, what's this?
-  This is, um,

24:48.220 --> 24:49.303
hot kombucha.

24:49.387 --> 24:50.679
Hot?

24:50.762 --> 24:52.595
Yeah, it's a--'cause that's
good for your--

24:52.679 --> 24:54.679
your "intestinals"
and your "indigestionals."

24:54.762 --> 24:56.095
It gets down in there
and gets the shit out.

24:56.178 --> 24:57.929
- That's some weird shit.
- He need that.

25:01.011 --> 25:04.261
All right, player.

25:06.762 --> 25:09.261
Why you got to always make
everything a business meeting?

25:09.345 --> 25:10.762
'Cause I'm a hustler!

25:10.845 --> 25:13.470
Yeah, but your hustles always
end up getting us in trouble.

25:13.553 --> 25:14.929
Look, I'd rather take the risk

25:15.011 --> 25:17.387
than live paycheck to paycheck
my whole life.

25:17.470 --> 25:19.762
Just don't get us locked up.
I ain't legal yet.

25:19.845 --> 25:21.970
Hey, we got this.

25:22.053 --> 25:23.762
We got it.

25:23.845 --> 25:25.470
Why you got to be so cocky?

25:25.553 --> 25:27.637
I ain't cocky.
I'm self-aware.

25:27.720 --> 25:28.637
Yeah. Mm.

25:32.887 --> 25:34.762
I hope his sister's okay.

25:34.845 --> 25:37.470
Yeah, she's been missing
for a long time now.

25:37.553 --> 25:41.345
Must be why Jake said
to give him some space.

25:41.428 --> 25:42.970
Jemma!

25:46.053 --> 25:48.303
- What's wrong?
- Jake ain't text me back yet.

25:48.387 --> 25:50.136
So? I rarely respond
to texts right away.

25:50.220 --> 25:51.887
Yeah, but he stay
looking at his phone.

25:51.970 --> 25:53.011
He'll respond.

25:53.095 --> 25:54.970
How them wack-ass girls
from the country club

25:55.053 --> 25:56.637
know that Kiesha's missing?

25:56.720 --> 25:58.595
I don't know.
People talk.

25:58.679 --> 26:01.595
Yeah, but I asked my people
not to.

26:01.679 --> 26:03.345
Man, fuck him.

26:03.428 --> 26:06.679
- Happy birthday, Kevin.
- Happy birthday.

26:09.887 --> 26:10.637
What?

26:12.595 --> 26:13.887
This cake better be ready.

26:13.970 --> 26:16.011
I told Ms. Williams
we'd get there early.

26:17.553 --> 26:19.387
And in case I haven't said it,

26:19.470 --> 26:21.178
you look beautiful today.

26:21.261 --> 26:23.011
Oh, thank you, boo.

26:28.637 --> 26:30.929
How long
you gonna make me wait?

26:31.011 --> 26:32.220
Wait for what?

26:32.303 --> 26:33.345
When we going public?

26:33.428 --> 26:35.178
I'm ready to tell people
we go together.

26:35.261 --> 26:37.595
The moment you tell people
you in a relationship,

26:37.679 --> 26:39.220
here they come
with they wack-ass opinions.

26:39.303 --> 26:40.970
I don't care
about people's opinions.

26:41.053 --> 26:42.595
I care about you.

26:42.679 --> 26:45.011
Look, I'll let you know
when I'm ready to go public,

26:45.095 --> 26:48.387
but for now, can we please
just keep a low profile?

26:48.470 --> 26:51.053
I'm here to pick up a order
for Nina Williams.

26:56.053 --> 26:58.220
Hey, is this for Williams?

26:58.303 --> 26:59.553
Yeah.

27:10.428 --> 27:12.595
Oh, hell, no!

27:12.679 --> 27:14.303
Who the fuck
is Kavyon?

27:14.387 --> 27:16.720
Fix it.
Jesus.

27:16.804 --> 27:20.261
- What's the problem?
- You guys spelled Kevin wrong.

27:20.345 --> 27:22.095
How's it supposed

27:22.178 --> 27:24.345
With an E
and an I after V.

27:24.428 --> 27:26.553
You know, how normal people
spell it.

27:29.887 --> 27:31.762
Can you fix this?

27:31.845 --> 27:33.595
I'm not leaving
without this cake.

27:33.679 --> 27:36.470
You ain't about to have Dre
mad at me.

27:42.178 --> 27:44.261
Whatever, man.

27:46.178 --> 27:49.136
Where is my red lipstick?

27:49.220 --> 27:51.595
Can't go nowhere
with a naked lip.

27:53.053 --> 27:56.845
That hussy of a nurse
turned the heat up in my room.

27:56.929 --> 28:00.220
She gonna have me get
all musty before I go out.

28:00.303 --> 28:01.804
Hey, beautiful,
the lipstick's...

28:01.887 --> 28:03.595
- right in your hand.
- Oh.

28:04.887 --> 28:06.970
Wow.

28:07.053 --> 28:09.595
Why you not wearing
your uniform?

28:09.679 --> 28:12.011
Uh, it's in the cleaner's.

28:15.470 --> 28:18.178
Okay, we going to Foxxies
or not?

28:19.053 --> 28:21.220
Because I always introduce
the band,

28:21.303 --> 28:23.470
and nobody does it like me.

28:23.553 --> 28:24.887

I know.
Now let's go.

28:41.387 --> 28:43.929
You know, my cousin
got shot last week.

28:44.011 --> 28:45.595
Damn.
Which one?

28:45.679 --> 28:47.595
The one
with the lazy eye.

28:47.679 --> 28:49.804
-  Did she survive?
-  Barely.

28:49.887 --> 28:51.345
The doctor said
she gonna be limping

28:51.428 --> 28:52.804
for the rest of her life.

28:52.887 --> 28:55.762
So she got a lazy eye
and a bum leg?

28:55.845 --> 28:58.261
Shit.
Life comes at you fast.

28:58.345 --> 29:00.220
Hey, I'm just glad
she's still alive.

29:00.303 --> 29:01.970
That's my favorite cousin.

29:02.053 --> 29:05.011
You know, she taught me how
to braid hair and make tacos.

29:05.095 --> 29:07.345
Hmm. Why would God
let her get shot?

29:07.428 --> 29:08.762
What?

29:08.845 --> 29:11.178
She just seems like someone
God would look out for.

29:11.261 --> 29:12.970
Well, I don't know
too much about God,

29:13.053 --> 29:15.095
but I do know
He ain't one to punish people.

29:15.178 --> 29:16.679
One time, I heard your dad say

29:16.762 --> 29:19.220
everything He does
is for the greater good,

29:19.303 --> 29:21.637
even if we don't get it
at times.

29:21.720 --> 29:24.553
It's a lot I don't understand
about God right now.

29:24.637 --> 29:27.178
How you a preacher's son
and don't understand God?

29:27.261 --> 29:30.053
Stuff used to make sense
back when I was younger,

29:30.136 --> 29:32.845
but now I just got
a lot of questions.

29:32.929 --> 29:34.470
I get that.

29:39.679 --> 29:41.387
- Shit.

29:41.470 --> 29:42.762
I knew I couldn't hold
your hand and that cake

29:42.845 --> 29:43.720
at the same damn time.

29:43.804 --> 29:46.011
Then why did you do it?

29:46.095 --> 29:47.387
'Cause...

30:15.220 --> 30:16.261
Thank you, baby,

30:16.345 --> 30:19.428
but I don't have the cash.

30:19.512 --> 30:21.887
I tried to call you,
but my phone only works

30:21.970 --> 30:25.637
with the Wi-Fi,
and the Wi-Fi been acting up.

30:25.720 --> 30:27.095
Fuck.
Um...

30:27.178 --> 30:28.387
And you know

30:28.470 --> 30:30.428
I wouldn't want
to send you off like that.

30:30.512 --> 30:32.387
- I know.
-  Maybe we can just go

30:32.470 --> 30:34.512
and come back
while you get some cash.

30:34.595 --> 30:36.804
Well, you gonna be waiting
a long time.

30:36.887 --> 30:41.428
I-I just spent my last dollar
on my pills.

30:43.178 --> 30:44.512
Don't worry.
I got you.

30:44.595 --> 30:47.428
You can just pay me back
when you have it.

30:47.512 --> 30:49.595
You know I don't like
a debt,

30:49.679 --> 30:54.011
especially when my soul
could cross over at any moment.

30:54.095 --> 30:56.720
How about I give you a reading

30:56.804 --> 30:59.220
in exchange for my flower?

30:59.303 --> 31:00.470
What kind of reading?

31:00.553 --> 31:02.220
A psychic reading.

31:02.303 --> 31:04.970
- Oh, we'll wait for the cash.
- Deal.

31:15.261 --> 31:16.512
Here you go.

31:30.887 --> 31:32.553
Mm.

31:34.220 --> 31:36.261
Uh, choose a card.

31:42.720 --> 31:45.470
Ah, the Lovers.

31:45.553 --> 31:47.762
Clearly, your love is strong,

31:47.845 --> 31:50.637
Yeah, I be loving on her.

31:52.762 --> 31:54.887
Take another card.

31:54.970 --> 31:56.220
That one.

31:58.553 --> 32:00.303
The Three of Swords.

32:00.387 --> 32:02.929
This means that there's danger
on the horizon.

32:03.011 --> 32:04.845
Ah, shit.

32:04.929 --> 32:07.720
- Your love has been tested.
- Yeah, it has.

32:07.804 --> 32:10.345
It will be tested again.

32:10.428 --> 32:13.345
What? How am I getting blamed
for shit I ain't even do yet?

32:13.428 --> 32:15.845
What you mean "yet"?

32:15.929 --> 32:17.178
Look, Lady Nubia,

32:17.261 --> 32:19.512
I didn't come here
to get into it with my girl.

32:19.595 --> 32:20.887
I'm just reading the cards.

32:20.970 --> 32:23.387
Well, can I pick a new one?
'Cause this some bullshit.

32:23.470 --> 32:26.887
There are forces in the world
that don't wish you well.

32:26.970 --> 32:29.637
The forces are hungry.

32:29.720 --> 32:32.053
Is "forces" another word
for "thirsty bitches"?

32:32.136 --> 32:33.679
What's her name?

32:33.762 --> 32:35.887
For that, you'll need to choose
another card.

32:35.970 --> 32:36.970
Okay.

32:37.053 --> 32:40.220
Mm-mm.
That'll cost you.

32:40.303 --> 32:42.387
See, I knew this was a hustle.

32:47.595 --> 32:48.595
Go ahead.

32:49.428 --> 32:50.470
That one.

32:54.887 --> 32:57.428
Knight of Wands.

32:57.512 --> 32:59.136
What?
What does it mean?

32:59.220 --> 33:00.303
You might as well
say something,

33:00.387 --> 33:02.512
'cause you ain't getting
no more free weed.

33:02.595 --> 33:04.428
Your dick is the force.

33:04.512 --> 33:08.178
It'll always need more
than her pussy can provide.

33:10.720 --> 33:12.470
Please don't tell me
you believe that shit.

33:12.553 --> 33:13.970
For the past year I been
selling to her,

33:14.053 --> 33:15.720
she ain't never predicted
nothing that ain't come true.

33:15.804 --> 33:17.011
That bitch is crazy!

33:17.095 --> 33:19.595
Come--look, Miss Cleo
in there don't know shit

33:19.679 --> 33:22.679
about how I feel about you
and what we got.

33:22.762 --> 33:24.053
You better not be cheating.

33:24.136 --> 33:26.095
Look. Look at me.

33:26.178 --> 33:27.387
Babe.

33:27.470 --> 33:29.887
I'm not cheating on you.
I am never gonna cheat on you.

33:29.970 --> 33:32.220
You my one and only,
I promise.

33:35.053 --> 33:36.136
I love you, Emmett,

33:36.220 --> 33:39.095
but you need
to get you a job.

33:39.178 --> 33:41.929
I like helping you.
I can act as your manager.

33:42.011 --> 33:43.470
I don't need no manager.
I got this.

33:43.553 --> 33:46.178
Now, come on, I ain't trying
to be late for Kevin's party.

33:46.261 --> 33:47.637
Did you get him a gift?

33:47.720 --> 33:49.929
No, you were supposed
to get him one.

33:50.011 --> 33:51.428
Damn.

33:51.512 --> 33:52.804
- Ah, shit.
- You know what?

33:52.887 --> 33:54.720
You need to start using
that brain of yours, okay?

33:54.804 --> 33:56.595
Why you always trying to
get physical with me?

33:56.679 --> 33:58.011
-  Because...
-  You look good.

33:58.095 --> 33:59.136
Yeah, whatever.

34:04.679 --> 34:06.136
You play?

34:06.220 --> 34:07.720
Little bit.

34:13.720 --> 34:17.595
Yeah, j-just like I thought.

34:17.679 --> 34:19.387
You play just like Reg.

34:24.053 --> 34:25.970
Man, stop fouling.

34:26.053 --> 34:28.929
Defense ain't fouling, nigga.
That's defense.

34:30.095 --> 34:31.762
Uh-huh.

34:31.845 --> 34:33.804
Reg told me
you got your shoes stolen

34:33.887 --> 34:36.220
when you was playing
over here.

34:36.303 --> 34:37.512
I did.

34:37.595 --> 34:40.345
He also said
you chased that nigga down...

34:40.428 --> 34:42.679
and beat the fuck out of him.

34:42.762 --> 34:47.095
And after that,
nobody fucked with you again.

34:47.178 --> 34:48.970
That's true, too.

34:49.053 --> 34:50.970
But I let him keep the shoes.

34:51.053 --> 34:52.720
I figured he needed them
more than me.

34:55.220 --> 34:56.762
Why'd you leave us?

35:00.553 --> 35:03.053
I wasn't a man yet.

35:03.136 --> 35:04.929
I needed to go
somewhere where...

35:05.011 --> 35:06.970
I could figure out
how to be one.

35:07.053 --> 35:08.970
So, while you was trying
to be a man,

35:09.053 --> 35:11.345
we was left in the house
without one?

35:11.428 --> 35:12.720
What kind of sense that make?

35:12.804 --> 35:14.887
Look, bro, what you want me
to do...

35:14.970 --> 35:17.679
turn back the hands of time
and--and fix everything?

35:17.762 --> 35:19.887
I can't go back
and make shit perfect.

35:19.970 --> 35:22.720
No, just stop trying to be
the black Superman.

35:22.804 --> 35:23.970
Just because you left me behind

35:24.053 --> 35:25.220
doesn't mean you need
to save me.

35:25.303 --> 35:26.845
All right, then.

35:26.929 --> 35:29.261
I'll stop trying to save you.

35:29.345 --> 35:31.053
You mad at me?

35:31.136 --> 35:35.261
- I have the right to be.
- But you can't be mad forever.

35:35.345 --> 35:37.553
You--you want to hit me?

35:37.637 --> 35:40.595
You got your fists balled up
like you want to hit me.

35:40.679 --> 35:43.261
Hit me.
Go ahead.

35:43.345 --> 35:44.679
Go ahead, nigga, hit me.
Hit me, nigga.

35:44.762 --> 35:45.970
Go ahead.

35:53.011 --> 35:54.470
That was a good one.

35:56.261 --> 35:57.470

35:58.553 --> 36:00.595

No one knows a son

He's no longer just
an extension of his mother,

40:34.845 --> 40:39.387

Grandma.

41:02.136 --> 41:03.387
Why you bring me here?

41:03.470 --> 41:05.053
'Cause you been begging me
to bring you.

41:05.136 --> 41:06.220

It's my fault those kids
know about your sister.

42:43.136 --> 42:45.428
- Why would you do that?
- It was an accident.

42:45.512 --> 42:47.261
I was talking to my mom
about Kiesha,

42:47.345 --> 42:48.595
and she must have told
Trip's mom,

42:48.679 --> 42:50.512
and Trip mom
must have told him.

42:50.595 --> 42:51.929
- I'm sorry.
-  Why would you

42:52.011 --> 42:54.220
tell your mom about the
situation in the first place?

42:54.303 --> 42:55.679
I was just telling her
how strong you are

42:55.762 --> 42:57.845
and how much of a hot mess
I would be if I was you.

42:57.929 --> 42:59.178
- Yeah, but you're not.
- I know.

42:59.261 --> 43:00.428
I just wanted some advice

43:00.512 --> 43:01.929
on how I could take your mind
off of things.

43:02.011 --> 43:02.970

the situation better?

43:04.929 --> 43:06.178
Kiesha could be dead right now.

43:06.261 --> 43:07.637

43:07.720 --> 43:09.178
Everything's gonna be
all right?

43:09.261 --> 43:12.053
Huh? You want me to make you
feel good about my situation?

43:12.136 --> 43:13.261
- No.

43:13.345 --> 43:14.679

Camille Hallaway,

46:32.303 --> 46:34.220
because by exposing my family,

46:34.303 --> 46:36.553
she exposed a problem
this city has been ignoring

46:36.637 --> 46:38.220
for far too long--

46:38.303 --> 46:41.387
the lack of access
to mental health care.

46:41.470 --> 46:44.387

as well.

47:00.762 --> 47:02.720
has said a lot of things
off-record

47:02.804 --> 47:05.512
that I think the city
deserves to hear.

47:08.261 --> 47:10.428
For example...

47:11.887 --> 47:13.887
Yes, I'm going to keep going

in low-income areas

to believe in but Jesus

47:18.929 --> 47:20.428

able to open this place up,

47:26.512 --> 47:27.845
but I did.

was chain-smoking.

48:11.261 --> 48:13.387
