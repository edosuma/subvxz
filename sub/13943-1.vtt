00:04.034 --> 00:07.003
It was the last day
of the war between humans and

00:07.037 --> 00:09.939
the giant monsters... Kaiju.

00:13.811 --> 00:17.046
But to me, it's
more than just history.

00:17.080 --> 00:20.950
It's family history.

00:20.984 --> 00:22.151
That's my mom.

00:22.186 --> 00:27.857
They say her bravery saved the
city that day, saved everything.

00:27.891 --> 00:31.060
This is also the day
my mom met my dad.

00:33.163 --> 00:36.399
Oh, yeah...
That's my dad.

00:53.784 --> 00:55.117
Maybe I should skip.

00:55.152 --> 00:57.720
Nothing says freak
like coal for lunch.

00:57.754 --> 01:00.356
You're not
a freak, Duncan.

01:00.390 --> 01:01.991
Get real, mom.

01:02.025 --> 01:02.859
I eat coal.

01:02.893 --> 01:03.693
And my skin?

01:03.727 --> 01:05.093
You can call it pumpkin.

01:05.128 --> 01:09.799
You can call it tangerine or... Or burnt
Sienna, but let's face it... it's orange.

01:09.833 --> 01:12.602
And "orange"
you just adorable?

01:12.636 --> 01:13.669
Ugh.

01:13.704 --> 01:17.373
Duncan, this is a
new school, not an execution.

01:17.407 --> 01:20.009
Just try to socialize,
make some friends.

01:20.043 --> 01:22.078
- And...
- And stop getting into fights.

01:22.112 --> 01:24.247
But they're the
ones who start it!

01:24.281 --> 01:27.750
Jerks are instinctively drawn to me,
like... Homing pigeons.

01:27.784 --> 01:32.021
Duncan, you're a 16-year-old boy,
like every other guy in your class, and

01:32.055 --> 01:34.590
every kid in that school
has problems of their own.

01:35.325 --> 01:37.860
So, if you can just get along
with people and keep your

01:37.895 --> 01:39.962
temper, everything's
going to be just fine.

01:39.997 --> 01:41.664
Message received.

01:41.698 --> 01:45.768
- And, Duncan...
- I love you too, mom.

01:45.802 --> 01:49.772
Actually, that
time, it was "rock on. "

01:58.649 --> 01:59.916
Unh!

02:00.717 --> 02:01.951
Uh-oh.

02:06.056 --> 02:09.991
Wh...

02:11.228 --> 02:12.628
Whoo! Whoo!

02:12.663 --> 02:14.797
Yeah, Jenna!

02:14.831 --> 02:16.065
What's going on?

02:16.099 --> 02:19.101
Yeah, looking good.

02:19.136 --> 02:20.803
Check out the new kid.

02:23.807 --> 02:24.640
Oh, I'm sorry.

02:24.675 --> 02:27.843
I thought there was some bird
crap on my rear view mirror, but

02:27.878 --> 02:29.879
now I can see it was
just your face.

02:32.582 --> 02:33.649
Yeah.

02:33.684 --> 02:35.384
That's a good one.

02:35.419 --> 02:36.218
Whoo!

02:43.226 --> 02:45.494
This is going to be the
best homecoming ever.

02:45.529 --> 02:46.729
Bye, Jenna. See you later.

02:46.763 --> 02:47.263
Ugh!

02:47.297 --> 02:47.830
Hey!

02:48.865 --> 02:50.733
You're so...

02:50.767 --> 02:52.134
So... Hot.

02:52.169 --> 02:53.202
Hmm?

02:53.236 --> 02:55.204
I, uh... the coffee.

02:56.740 --> 02:59.208
I meant this coffee is...
is so hot.

02:59.242 --> 03:00.776
Oh, I'm so sorry!

03:00.811 --> 03:04.080
I ask them to brew my cafe con
leche at 150 degrees so it's

03:04.114 --> 03:05.581
still hot when I get here.

03:05.615 --> 03:06.482
Diva, right?

03:06.516 --> 03:08.217
Uh, how did it not burn you?

03:08.251 --> 03:10.987
No, no, it
feels good, actually.

03:11.021 --> 03:11.721
I was freezing.

03:11.755 --> 03:15.024
I don't know why they always have to
blast the AC. In these schools, anyway.

03:15.058 --> 03:17.827
It must be
80 degrees in here.

03:17.861 --> 03:18.594
Oh, whatever.

03:18.628 --> 03:21.564
I'm on the student council, so
I'll see what I can do about

03:21.598 --> 03:22.965
getting the heat turned on.

03:23.967 --> 03:26.202
I wouldn't have pegged you for
the student council type.

03:26.236 --> 03:30.806
Student council, chairwoman of the
homecoming committee... I'm that girl.

03:30.841 --> 03:35.678
By the way, it's Jenna.

03:35.712 --> 03:36.245
Ugh!

03:36.279 --> 03:38.247
Oops.

03:50.027 --> 03:54.797
I'd like to ask the whole class
to give a warm welcome to

03:54.831 --> 04:01.303
Duncan Xerxes Absalom Belphegor Gressil
Uh, yeah, just

04:01.338 --> 04:02.738
"Duncan" is fine, Ms. Dreakford.

04:02.773 --> 04:04.240
Oh, all right.

04:04.274 --> 04:05.975
Take a seat, Duncan.

04:06.009 --> 04:08.577
Hey, Duncan,
sit here with Kenny.

04:08.612 --> 04:10.312
He doesn't have a lab partner.

04:10.347 --> 04:11.747
Uh, thanks, Isabel.

04:11.782 --> 04:12.948
Hi. Duncan.

04:12.983 --> 04:14.183
Ken Rogers.

04:14.217 --> 04:15.951
Kenny Rogers, huh?

04:15.986 --> 04:19.255
Do you know when to hold 'em,
know when to fold 'em?

04:19.289 --> 04:21.322
No, not even a little.

04:21.358 --> 04:26.395
Like reptiles and insects,
amphibians are ectotherms and

04:26.430 --> 04:31.867
cannot internally regulate their
body temperature... what we used

04:31.902 --> 04:33.936
to call "cold-blooded. "

04:33.970 --> 04:35.404
Why did we stop?

04:35.439 --> 04:38.507
Did the amphibians object to
being labelled "cold-blooded"?

04:39.342 --> 04:43.045
No, Mrs. dreakford, this
is so wrong for so many reasons.

04:43.080 --> 04:46.082
Beyond the obvious animal-cruelty
issues, students have a right...

04:46.116 --> 04:47.416
Uh, Jen, that'll be enough.

04:47.451 --> 04:50.419
<i>No, a duty to refuse
to do anything unbelievably gross.</i>

04:50.454 --> 04:51.353
That's quite enough.

04:51.388 --> 04:53.790
Forcing us to mutilate these
helpless innocent animals.

04:54.925 --> 04:57.293
...Without offering a
choice in the matter is clearly

04:57.327 --> 04:59.795
an abuse of the authority of the
school board... Jenna, just zip it.

04:59.830 --> 05:01.564
...And a just plain bad example to set.

05:02.999 --> 05:06.669
...In case, you know, some sick kids
actually might enjoy cutting up frogs and

05:06.703 --> 05:07.703
pulling out their guts.

05:07.737 --> 05:09.305
Whoa!

05:10.240 --> 05:10.806
Aah! Oh, no!

05:10.841 --> 05:12.374
They're water boarding Kermit!

05:13.543 --> 05:15.311
Whoo! He's a jumper!

05:15.345 --> 05:16.178
Look out!

05:16.213 --> 05:17.113
Hey! Hey! Hey!

05:17.147 --> 05:22.885
Uh... Whoa!

05:22.919 --> 05:23.786
Ohh!

05:23.820 --> 05:25.287
Aah!

05:25.322 --> 05:26.789
What is that?

05:29.025 --> 05:30.292
Are you done?

05:30.327 --> 05:31.460
What is up with you?

05:31.495 --> 05:32.895
You make Troy look mature.

05:32.929 --> 05:33.662
Stop it!

05:34.731 --> 05:35.965
Settle down, everyone.

05:39.936 --> 05:41.237
I can't believe that jerk.

05:41.271 --> 05:42.304
What a dork.

05:42.339 --> 05:46.575
And I actually thought he was
kind of cute until he did that.

05:47.811 --> 05:49.245
Nicely done, man.

05:49.279 --> 05:50.980
Just don't
mention it, all right?

05:51.014 --> 05:52.982
Bad joke... that's all.

05:58.188 --> 06:02.591
Okay, Mr. Belphegor Gressil
Pythius, what's your secret?

06:02.626 --> 06:04.660
Hair gel, extra hold.

06:04.694 --> 06:06.595
<i>Ha!.</i>

06:06.630 --> 06:10.166
<i>How come your name is like an
a- list of mythological bad boys?</i>

06:10.200 --> 06:11.233
<i>Care to explain?</i>

06:11.268 --> 06:13.402
Unconventional parents.

06:13.436 --> 06:15.738
<i>You really know your
Crypto zoology.</i>

06:15.772 --> 06:16.705
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

06:16.740 --> 06:18.674
<i>Isabel loves all that
a creepy stuff.</i>

06:18.708 --> 06:20.209
<i>She's a giant monster fan girl.</i>

06:20.243 --> 06:23.679
<i>"Monster" is in
the eye of the beholder.</i>

06:23.713 --> 06:25.181
<i>They're Kaiju, Kenny.</i>

06:25.215 --> 06:26.982
<i>Fine. Whatever.</i>

06:27.017 --> 06:28.484
<i>Sorry.</i>

06:28.518 --> 06:30.219
<i>They're not monsters.</i>

06:30.253 --> 06:33.189
<i>They fight us because we
keep trying to kill them.</i>

06:33.223 --> 06:36.959
<i>16 years since Belloc was last
seen, and we keep thinking the</i>

06:36.993 --> 06:40.429
<i>Kaiju are a threat?</i>

06:40.463 --> 06:42.097
<i>What's the matter?</i>

06:42.132 --> 06:42.998
<i>Ugh!</i>

06:47.537 --> 06:48.938
<i>What sphincters.</i>

06:48.972 --> 06:52.174
<i>Shouldn't evolution have weeded
those guys out of the gene pool</i>

06:52.209 --> 06:52.808
<i>eons ago?</i>

06:52.842 --> 06:56.045
<i>No, cockroaches have
remained unchanged for millions</i>

06:56.079 --> 06:56.812
<i>of years.</i>

06:56.846 --> 07:00.716
<i>Well, you're clearly
not a moron, so what was up with</i>

07:00.750 --> 07:02.618
<i>the idiot dance back in class?</i>

07:02.652 --> 07:04.019
<i>Did you like it?</i>

07:04.054 --> 07:05.588
<i>I've got some notes.</i>

07:05.622 --> 07:08.324
<i>But I liked the part where you
hid something in your jacket.</i>

07:08.358 --> 07:09.225
<i>You going to show me?</i>

07:09.259 --> 07:11.961
<i>Just keep it quiet.</i>

07:19.336 --> 07:21.237
<i>No way!</i>

07:21.271 --> 07:23.439
<i>Gomorra don... unreal!</i>

07:23.473 --> 07:25.841
<i>It's kind of
like a little tiny Kaiju.</i>

07:25.875 --> 07:28.611
<i>It's a gomorradon,
my dear Duncan.</i>

07:28.645 --> 07:30.312
<i>These things live on Kaijus.</i>

07:30.347 --> 07:33.916
<i>They scout, warn of danger, and
live off the slime that forms</i>

07:33.950 --> 07:35.251
<i>between their scales.</i>

07:35.285 --> 07:36.385
<i>Sorry I asked.</i>

07:36.419 --> 07:38.687
<i>What's it doing here, and how
come you know all this?</i>

07:38.722 --> 07:41.490
<i>I read books on this
stuff all the time... small press.</i>

07:41.524 --> 07:42.024
<i>Watch it.</i>

07:42.058 --> 07:44.026
<i>- Whatever you do, don't...
- Ow!</i>

07:45.262 --> 07:46.061
<i>Let it go.</i>

07:47.397 --> 07:50.566
<i>Unh!</i>

07:50.600 --> 07:51.300
<i>Ugh!</i>

08:04.681 --> 08:06.148
<i>Right here... this is the one.</i>

08:06.182 --> 08:08.284
<i>This is definitely
Jenna's locker.</i>

08:10.253 --> 08:12.054
<i>Hye!</i>

08:12.088 --> 08:12.888
<i>Ow!</i>

08:14.324 --> 08:15.758
<i>You guys are morons.</i>

08:15.792 --> 08:18.627
<i>Give me your library card.</i>

08:18.662 --> 08:21.230
<i>And that's how it's done.</i>

08:25.034 --> 08:26.768
All right,
ladies, line up.

08:26.802 --> 08:28.403
I'm your new gym teacher.

08:28.437 --> 08:32.740
You can call me coach Barnes or,
once you come to love me, "blitz. "

08:32.775 --> 08:36.477
Hey, "blitz," I was
wondering when I'd run into you.

08:36.511 --> 08:37.611
Gym teacher?

08:37.645 --> 08:39.647
That's your cover? Really?

08:39.682 --> 08:42.750
You're coming down in the
world since the last school.

08:42.784 --> 08:46.654
The whole vice principal
thing really cramped my style.

08:46.689 --> 08:48.389
I could only yell at the kids.

08:48.424 --> 08:50.558
Here I can get a
lot more physical.

08:53.228 --> 08:55.196
A heads up! Unh!

08:59.802 --> 09:02.603
Yeah! That's right!

09:02.638 --> 09:04.539
Two losers left.

09:04.573 --> 09:06.374
Up yours, Troy!

09:06.408 --> 09:07.342
Unh!

09:08.877 --> 09:12.380
Time to take out the trash...
the trailer trash.

09:12.948 --> 09:15.016
You really are the
king of the jerk wads.

09:15.050 --> 09:17.018
It's good to be the king.

09:19.722 --> 09:20.955
Enough!

09:20.989 --> 09:21.656
Huh?

09:33.602 --> 09:34.736
Huh?

09:34.770 --> 09:36.738
Hey, spread out!

09:47.816 --> 09:48.683
No way.

09:49.818 --> 09:50.618
Yeah!

09:50.652 --> 09:53.087
Whoo!

09:53.122 --> 09:55.089
How'd he do that?

10:16.779 --> 10:17.545
What?

10:24.720 --> 10:28.189
Troy, catch with
your hands, not your face.

10:31.760 --> 10:33.761
I didn't ask you
to do that, you know.

10:33.796 --> 10:34.595
I know.

10:34.630 --> 10:36.297
Didn't need you to save me.

10:36.331 --> 10:37.231
I didn't.

10:37.266 --> 10:39.867
I just got sick of hearing
the dill weeds crow.

10:39.902 --> 10:43.271
Well, that was fairly cool.

10:43.305 --> 10:46.774
Actually, you could take that show
on the road and sell tickets.

10:46.809 --> 10:49.510
No big deal.

10:50.512 --> 10:52.280
Get lost, trailer park.

10:54.016 --> 10:56.651
Uh, it's a free
country, amigo.

10:56.685 --> 10:58.820
It's okay, Kenny.

10:58.854 --> 10:59.487
Go.

11:04.526 --> 11:06.461
You know what happens now?

11:06.495 --> 11:10.698
Well, traditionally,
this is where I hand you your

11:10.732 --> 11:12.700
meat, all nice and on a slab.

11:13.769 --> 11:20.808
But I pretty much promised my
mom I wouldn't fight, so... Later!

11:20.843 --> 11:22.043
Hey!

11:22.077 --> 11:24.045
Get him!

11:35.224 --> 11:37.191
What is he doing?

11:48.036 --> 11:52.406
Hey, blitz.

12:16.532 --> 12:18.332
Ugh!

12:26.341 --> 12:26.874
What?

12:29.912 --> 12:31.178
There he is!

12:32.281 --> 12:34.248
Come on!

12:39.288 --> 12:41.255
You all right?

12:49.831 --> 12:51.299
You don't want to fight me.

12:51.333 --> 12:52.500
Don't worry.

12:52.534 --> 12:58.606
It's not going to be a
fight, just a beat down.

12:58.640 --> 13:01.709
Leave me alone!

13:01.743 --> 13:03.544
Oh, forget this.

13:08.116 --> 13:09.584
Ugh!

13:09.618 --> 13:11.552
Holy hello, kid.

13:11.587 --> 13:13.220
Way to keep a low profile.

13:13.255 --> 13:15.423
Dude breathed fire, man.

13:15.457 --> 13:16.324
W- what is he?

13:16.358 --> 13:20.561
Get to class now,
or you're expelled.

13:20.596 --> 13:21.829
It's not my fault!

13:21.863 --> 13:22.663
It just happened!

13:22.698 --> 13:23.598
Later, kid.

13:23.632 --> 13:25.533
If Troy's hurt,
he was asking for it.

13:25.567 --> 13:26.767
Don't worry about it.

13:26.802 --> 13:28.235
I was going to
bench him, anyway.

13:28.270 --> 13:31.005
He runs fine, but he couldn't
hold onto a ball with a handle.

14:06.508 --> 14:08.943
Well, this doesn't look too bad.

14:08.977 --> 14:10.611
Are you kidding me?

14:10.646 --> 14:13.047
My face looks like the
Australian outback.

14:13.081 --> 14:15.282
More like the
surface of Mars.

14:15.317 --> 14:17.385
Mars?

14:17.419 --> 14:20.321
No, it's not mar...
I mean, a little bit Mars, but no.

14:20.355 --> 14:21.756
Is this it, doc?

14:21.790 --> 14:23.791
Or should we expect
other surprises?

14:23.825 --> 14:27.128
Well, obviously, Duncan's
innate strength and resilience

14:27.162 --> 14:30.631
have been growing steadily
since birth, but his natural

14:30.666 --> 14:35.169
fight-or-flight response created
a hyper-stimulated state, which

14:35.203 --> 14:41.676
manifested itself as
incendiary respire.

14:41.710 --> 14:42.677
It's fire breath.

14:42.711 --> 14:44.111
Yeah, you have it, Duncan.

14:44.146 --> 14:47.181
You'll learn to control it in
time, but until then, you're

14:47.215 --> 14:51.185
just going to have to stay out of
situations with, uh, potential conflict.

14:51.219 --> 14:52.687
Like high school?

14:52.721 --> 14:54.221
High school.

14:54.256 --> 14:55.489
I remember high school.

14:55.524 --> 14:57.658
That place didn't
work out well for me.

14:57.693 --> 15:01.228
What I'm asking is...
When will Duncan constitute a threat?

15:01.263 --> 15:03.164
To humanity? Duncan?

15:03.198 --> 15:05.166
No, no. He's a sweet boy.

15:07.135 --> 15:07.835
He's not a pandemic.

15:08.403 --> 15:11.539
- It's only a matter of time
- Duncan.

15:11.573 --> 15:12.373
Hi, mom.

15:12.407 --> 15:15.042
Whose brilliant idea
was it to bring Duncan here?

15:15.077 --> 15:17.878
Uh...
How have you been, Margaret?

15:17.913 --> 15:20.014
It's been a while.

15:20.048 --> 15:22.817
Look... I-I don't like this,
either, but there was little

15:22.851 --> 15:28.155
- incendiary respire incident at school and...
- That's what we call

15:28.190 --> 15:29.190
a "your problem. "

15:29.224 --> 15:32.493
I have a legal contract with
megtaf, stipulating my son have

15:32.527 --> 15:34.428
as normal a life as
humanly possible.

15:34.463 --> 15:37.131
And that's exactly
what I'm doing, Margaret.

15:37.165 --> 15:41.302
Your son's a fine kid, especially
for a boy without a father.

15:41.336 --> 15:46.173
I'd be happy to give you my two cents
about him over dinner sometime.

15:46.208 --> 15:46.974
Ah.

15:47.008 --> 15:48.042
A son of a buck!

15:49.945 --> 15:50.544
Not bad, huh?

15:50.579 --> 15:51.378
Very interesting.

15:51.413 --> 15:53.214
Oh, baby.

15:53.248 --> 15:55.816
It's an old
gag, a classic.

15:55.851 --> 15:59.353
The flash powder ignites on contact and...
poof!... Fireworks.

15:59.387 --> 16:01.489
You can buy it at any
decent magic shop.

16:01.523 --> 16:02.256
What?

16:02.290 --> 16:06.193
That is such a load of bullcrap!

16:06.228 --> 16:08.395
The freak's mouth shot flames!

16:08.430 --> 16:09.263
Ugh!

16:09.297 --> 16:12.333
Troy, we have discussed school
policy on name-calling.

16:12.367 --> 16:15.503
And, Duncan, your prank could
have ended in serious injury.

16:15.537 --> 16:16.904
No, I-it did!

16:16.938 --> 16:19.206
My eyebrows were
totally burned off!

16:19.241 --> 16:24.445
Troy, no offense, but I've had you in here
so many times, your name should be on that

16:24.479 --> 16:25.946
chair on a brass plaque.

16:25.981 --> 16:29.250
Now, since you're both at
fault, you can either choose

16:29.284 --> 16:34.688
suspension, or work together
to clean up the damage.

16:34.723 --> 16:35.489
Your call.

16:35.524 --> 16:37.091
Oh, yeah, right!

16:37.125 --> 16:40.995
Like I'm going to do
anything with that yob?

16:47.669 --> 16:54.575
Look, Troy, um... I'm truly ashamed of my
thoughtless, dangerous, and immature prank.

16:54.609 --> 16:55.643
I'm sorry.

16:55.677 --> 16:57.945
Are you kidding me?

16:57.979 --> 16:59.313
I know what I saw.

16:59.347 --> 17:01.248
You are some kind of freak.

17:01.283 --> 17:02.783
Just stay away from me.

17:02.818 --> 17:06.387
Could've told you
how that one would go.

17:06.421 --> 17:09.356
So, you coming to the big party
on Berkshire Lane Saturday?

17:09.391 --> 17:11.559
I wasn't
invited to any party.

17:11.593 --> 17:12.760
Nobody was.

17:12.794 --> 17:16.830
It's a "someone's parents are out of town"
party, where everybody just shows up.

17:16.865 --> 17:19.900
Uh, yeah, I-it's not
really my kind of scene.

17:19.935 --> 17:21.535
I- I'm not totally comfortable.

17:21.569 --> 17:23.470
Oh, come on.

17:23.505 --> 17:26.406
You just tried to shake
hands with Troy Adams.

17:26.441 --> 17:28.709
This is like 10 times
easier than that.

17:29.878 --> 17:32.046
Guys, seriously,
it was in my locker.

17:32.080 --> 17:33.714
When I got back,
it was just gone.

17:33.748 --> 17:36.350
Why were you keeping the money
in your locker, anyway, Jenna?

17:39.654 --> 17:44.158
About that party...
Everyone is going, seriously.

17:44.192 --> 17:45.492
Everyone.

17:45.527 --> 17:49.897
Uh...
Maybe I might stop by.

18:18.360 --> 18:22.863
Hmm.

18:22.898 --> 18:27.201
Duncan Rosenblatt.

18:28.203 --> 18:30.638
Where do you
think you're going?

18:30.672 --> 18:35.409
Well, uh, it's like this...
I'm kind of going to a, um, party.

18:35.443 --> 18:38.879
You were
invited to a party?

18:38.914 --> 18:39.980
Oh, I'm so happy.

18:40.015 --> 18:44.051
Your confidence in my
people skills is overwhelming, mom.

18:44.085 --> 18:49.089
Anyway, it's probably going to be a couple
of dorks sitting around playing video

18:49.124 --> 18:49.657
games.

18:49.691 --> 18:54.862
Well, I
hope you have fun.

19:12.090 --> 19:13.591
Yeah!

19:31.343 --> 19:32.676
Hey, Jenna.

19:32.711 --> 19:37.815
Uh, so, about my little dork show
What?

19:37.849 --> 19:41.185
Y- you see, there was this
thing, and I had to catch it.

19:41.219 --> 19:43.087
What are you
talking about?

19:43.121 --> 19:46.090
Duncan, right?

19:46.124 --> 19:50.761
As humiliating as I'm sure that was, I
would trade places with you in a heartbeat.

19:50.795 --> 19:51.962
What's up?

19:51.997 --> 19:54.164
I saw everyone acting
weird around you.

19:54.199 --> 19:55.666
You haven't heard?

19:55.700 --> 19:58.235
I lost all the money we'd
raised for homecoming.

19:58.270 --> 19:59.236
No way.

19:59.271 --> 20:02.339
I thought it was in my
locker, but it's just gone.

20:02.374 --> 20:03.674
I've looked everywhere.

20:03.708 --> 20:05.175
I think I'm losing my mind.

20:05.210 --> 20:07.478
I'm sure people think
I just pocketed it.

20:07.512 --> 20:10.314
Then people have
their heads up their butts.

20:10.348 --> 20:11.916
You'd never do that.

20:11.950 --> 20:14.852
Thanks.

20:14.886 --> 20:17.121
Anyway, it doesn't matter
what anybody thinks.

20:17.155 --> 20:19.890
The fact is, there's no
dance without that money.

20:20.625 --> 20:25.496
I'd do whatever job to pay it back,
but there's only two weeks left.

20:25.530 --> 20:30.401
Look, Jenna... I know you don't want
to talk to me, but this guy is bad news.

20:30.435 --> 20:31.402
Stay away from him.

20:31.436 --> 20:32.870
What is up with you?

20:32.904 --> 20:36.073
You want to know the punishment for
being stupid enough to date you?

20:36.107 --> 20:36.974
Dating you!

20:37.008 --> 20:40.344
I'm telling you...
he can do freaky stuff!

20:40.946 --> 20:41.979
Troy!

20:43.214 --> 20:46.417
What part of "grounded"
didn't you understand?

20:46.451 --> 20:47.618
He is so busted.

20:48.954 --> 20:50.854
You must be a glutton
for punishment, boy.

20:55.627 --> 20:57.761
Wow. Is that his dad?

20:57.796 --> 21:01.732
I guess the rage issue doesn't
fall very far from the tree.

21:01.766 --> 21:04.868
I bet he wishes his dad
would just disappear.

21:06.271 --> 21:08.105
It's getting late. Excuse me.

21:08.139 --> 21:09.406
What?

21:09.441 --> 21:09.807
Oh.

21:10.709 --> 21:12.476
I... okay.

21:12.510 --> 21:14.979
Unh! Idiot!

21:15.013 --> 21:17.348
Struck out
with Jenna, huh?

21:17.382 --> 21:18.615
You're not the first.

21:18.650 --> 21:22.219
I wish I knew what
I said to set her off.

21:22.253 --> 21:24.421
Jenna's dad is dead.

21:24.456 --> 21:25.889
Oh, man.

21:25.924 --> 21:27.191
How stupid am I?

21:27.225 --> 21:30.527
I mean, I totally know how bad it
bites to grow up without a dad.

21:30.562 --> 21:32.396
There's a rat in here!

21:34.666 --> 21:35.265
Whoa.

21:35.300 --> 21:37.234
Something just
crawled on my leg.

21:37.268 --> 21:39.003
My purse... it's in my purse!

21:39.037 --> 21:40.237
There's one right there!

21:42.073 --> 21:44.408
It's those things again.

21:44.442 --> 21:45.776
Gomorra dons.

21:46.544 --> 21:48.312
Whoa! Whoa!

21:49.247 --> 21:50.547
Whoa. Aah.

21:52.550 --> 21:54.251
They didn't come alone.

21:54.285 --> 21:57.921
That's their master.

21:57.956 --> 22:01.225
Kaiju! Look out!

22:01.259 --> 22:02.559
It's Belloc!

22:02.594 --> 22:04.428
Seriously... Belloc!

22:04.462 --> 22:06.430
Run!

22:17.742 --> 22:20.310
It doesn't make sense!

22:20.345 --> 22:21.712
Why now? Why here?

22:21.746 --> 22:23.180
Because I'm here.

22:23.214 --> 22:24.314
He's looking for me.

22:24.349 --> 22:25.249
Why?

22:25.283 --> 22:28.352
Because he's not only
Belloc, king of the Kaiju.

22:28.386 --> 22:32.556
He's also... My dad.

22:49.240 --> 22:51.241
Is it smelling for you?

22:51.276 --> 22:53.243
He must know my scent.

22:53.278 --> 22:55.746
I'm not kidding about
him being my dad.

22:55.780 --> 22:57.181
You better run, Isabel.

22:57.215 --> 22:58.682
Aah!

23:04.355 --> 23:09.226
I said run!

23:17.402 --> 23:18.602
Ugh!

23:18.636 --> 23:20.337
No! Let her go!

23:20.371 --> 23:22.673
You'll crush her!

23:26.511 --> 23:29.780
I said let her go!

23:35.520 --> 23:37.488
Duncan.

23:44.696 --> 23:46.663
Aah!

23:56.307 --> 23:58.442
Let me go!

24:15.960 --> 24:19.563
Where are you taking me?

24:26.671 --> 24:27.971
Excellent.

24:28.006 --> 24:28.939
Huh?

24:28.973 --> 24:32.242
Duncan...
Let me look at you.

24:32.277 --> 24:35.179
Why don't you just
kill me and get it over with?

24:35.213 --> 24:38.582
If I wanted to
kill you, you'd be dead.

25:21.392 --> 25:28.298
We are an ancient race, Duncan,
so old we became myths to the humans.

25:28.333 --> 25:36.073
They call us invaders, when it is
they who have infested our world.

25:46.084 --> 25:47.884
Where are we?

25:47.919 --> 25:50.954
Home, Duncan,
your true home.

25:50.989 --> 25:52.256
No way.

25:52.290 --> 25:53.590
This isn't my home.

25:53.625 --> 25:57.060
That doesn't change just
because my father's a Kaiju!

25:57.095 --> 25:59.463
<i>I am not a Kaiju.</i>

25:59.497 --> 26:02.532
<i>I am Belloc, king of the Kaiju!</i>

26:02.567 --> 26:07.271
Though you are my
son, you are weak.

26:10.074 --> 26:11.241
Unh!

26:11.276 --> 26:13.143
I'm strong enough!

26:13.177 --> 26:14.211
No.

26:14.245 --> 26:17.080
The human world has
made your heart soft.

26:17.115 --> 26:24.121
You must be hard and remorseless
if you are to rule over the Kaiju.

26:24.155 --> 26:24.755
Listen.

26:24.789 --> 26:25.989
They're assembling.

26:26.024 --> 26:27.557
They've caught our scent.

26:27.592 --> 26:28.258
Come.

26:31.996 --> 26:37.336
There is a war coming, Duncan,
between Human and Kaiju,

26:37.361 --> 26:39.369
a war that could end

26:39.370 --> 26:40.437
everything.

26:40.471 --> 26:43.106
It is a terrible burden to bear.

26:43.141 --> 26:46.877
But for the good of all,
you have no choice.

26:46.911 --> 26:49.646
You think I'm going to
be king of these creatures?

26:49.681 --> 26:52.149
I am not a monster!

26:52.183 --> 26:54.251
You are my son!

26:54.285 --> 26:58.722
You are half-Kaiju, Duncan, superior
to everyone you have ever known.

26:58.756 --> 27:01.458
That's why
you brought me here?

27:01.492 --> 27:05.195
You ignore me for 16 years, and
and you expect to train me for

27:05.229 --> 27:08.065
something that I
don't even want?!

27:34.792 --> 27:37.961
I'm your king.

27:37.995 --> 27:40.263
This is my son.

27:40.298 --> 27:42.499
You desecrate our race!

27:42.533 --> 27:44.501
You shame our ceremony!

27:44.535 --> 27:48.672
Bad enough you keep us from
exterminating the human vermin.

27:48.706 --> 27:50.874
<i>Now you mate with them.</i>

27:50.908 --> 27:53.477
Who challenges
their king?!

27:53.511 --> 27:54.978
You, abandon?

27:55.012 --> 27:56.680
Or you, astaroth?

27:58.883 --> 28:01.351
I thought as much.

28:01.386 --> 28:03.887
Then I make my choice.

28:03.921 --> 28:06.857
This is Duncan, my hair!

28:06.891 --> 28:07.524
Huh?

28:07.558 --> 28:11.561
W- what happens now?

28:11.596 --> 28:12.562
Ugh!

28:12.597 --> 28:15.332
Aaaaaaaah!

28:56.808 --> 28:58.775
Ugh.

29:02.480 --> 29:03.780
What?

29:54.599 --> 29:55.799
Ken, it's me.

29:55.833 --> 29:56.666
Duncan?

29:56.701 --> 29:57.834
Wait up.

29:57.869 --> 30:01.104
Before you open the door,
you need to know... I look weird.

30:01.138 --> 30:02.105
Yeah, I know.

30:02.139 --> 30:04.040
No, I mean
weirder than before.

30:04.075 --> 30:05.876
Compared to this, I
used to look great.

30:05.910 --> 30:10.046
So brace yourself.

30:10.081 --> 30:12.115
Okay.

30:12.149 --> 30:13.149
You want a soda?

30:13.184 --> 30:15.452
So, you're
not freaked out?

30:15.486 --> 30:16.620
Not really.

30:16.654 --> 30:18.088
Belloc's all over the TV.

30:18.122 --> 30:21.258
Our Kaiju alert level is red,
which is like the highest.

30:21.292 --> 30:24.995
Compared to that, you're
just not that shocking, man.

30:25.029 --> 30:27.665
Besides, when Isabel told me
your old man was Belloc...

30:27.690 --> 30:29.099
She told you?

30:29.100 --> 30:30.667
She tells me everything.

30:30.701 --> 30:32.002
We're best friends.

30:32.036 --> 30:35.739
It's like we have some kind of
deep, mysterious connection.

30:35.773 --> 30:37.207
Uh, yeah.

30:37.241 --> 30:38.441
You can totally tell.

30:38.476 --> 30:40.944
So, your dad's
king of all monsters.

30:40.978 --> 30:41.411
Cool.

30:41.445 --> 30:42.879
No, not cool.

30:42.914 --> 30:44.748
First of all, he did this to me.

30:44.782 --> 30:46.049
That's why I came here.

30:46.083 --> 30:48.652
My mom is going to seizure
when she sees this.

30:48.686 --> 30:51.321
It's not that bad, bro.

30:51.355 --> 30:54.357
So, your mom...
she's human, right?

30:54.392 --> 30:55.091
Huh?

30:56.294 --> 30:57.060
Cool.

30:57.094 --> 31:01.197
Yeah, so, not only is my dad, you
know, a monster, but he's psychotic.

31:01.232 --> 31:02.232
I'm not big enough.

31:02.266 --> 31:03.366
I'm not tough enough.

31:03.401 --> 31:06.770
I'm a total disappointment to him
unless I do everything his way.

31:06.804 --> 31:08.338
He...

31:08.372 --> 31:11.775
Y- your dad...
he's on a trip or something, right?

31:11.809 --> 31:13.143
Yeah, pretty much.

31:13.177 --> 31:15.011
When does he get back?

31:15.046 --> 31:16.780
Yeah.

31:16.814 --> 31:18.281
That's a good question.

31:18.316 --> 31:20.216
We're friends, right?

31:20.251 --> 31:24.888
I mean, you can keep a secret?

31:24.922 --> 31:26.923
I think my old man is
a spy or something.

31:26.958 --> 31:27.891
Mm-hmm.

31:27.925 --> 31:30.794
He can't talk about it,
obviously, but the pieces fit.

31:30.828 --> 31:35.365
He's always vanishing for months at a time,
then reappearing without explanation.

31:35.399 --> 31:36.266
Hmm.

31:36.300 --> 31:37.434
That could explain it.

31:37.468 --> 31:39.336
You can't
tell anyone, okay?

31:39.370 --> 31:40.971
Consider
your secret kept.

31:41.005 --> 31:44.674
And if you could refrain from
mentioning that it was my dad

31:44.709 --> 31:50.380
who crashed the party last
night, that would be great.

31:50.414 --> 31:53.083
What were you doing
at that party anyway, bro?

31:53.117 --> 31:54.517
Isabel invited me.

31:54.552 --> 31:56.052
Isabel invited you?

31:56.087 --> 31:59.022
No, no, she just
told me about the party.

31:59.056 --> 32:01.257
But Isabel was
there, at the party?

32:01.292 --> 32:02.459
Yeah.

32:04.629 --> 32:05.795
Hello?

32:05.830 --> 32:07.664
Yes, this is Ken Rogers.

32:07.698 --> 32:11.668
Who is this?

32:11.702 --> 32:12.569
Duncan?

32:12.603 --> 32:16.072
Hi, mom.

32:16.841 --> 32:19.776
Half of megtaf is scouring
the desert for him, Margaret.

32:19.810 --> 32:21.878
If Belloc's out there,
we'll find him.

32:21.912 --> 32:25.048
<i>Colonel Barnes, maybe
you should send out all of</i>

32:25.082 --> 32:29.919
megtaf, since half of it is having
difficulty finding a 120-foot giant.

32:29.954 --> 32:31.287
But mar...

32:31.322 --> 32:32.155
Ugh!

32:32.189 --> 32:33.156
Easy, mom.

32:33.190 --> 32:36.593
It's not Barnes' fault
Belloc is back.

32:38.029 --> 32:44.934
Well, it's certainly not your fault, and
it's.. Duncan, are you blaming me for this?

32:44.969 --> 32:49.873
Duncan, everything I've done,
every choice I've made... coming

32:49.907 --> 32:54.044
here, the deal, megtaf...
it's all been to protect you.

32:54.078 --> 32:56.713
Well, it
didn't do much good.

32:56.747 --> 32:59.249
Nothing can stop the biggest
monster in the world.

32:59.283 --> 33:03.286
Your father is a great many
things, but he is not a monster.

33:03.320 --> 33:08.158
You don't know the things he's been
through, the good things he's done.

33:08.192 --> 33:12.529
I don't expect you to
understand, but I did love him.

33:12.563 --> 33:16.032
And he gave me you.

33:16.067 --> 33:18.034
So, what am I?

33:18.069 --> 33:20.003
Am I human, or am I Kaiju?

33:20.037 --> 33:21.871
You're you.

33:21.906 --> 33:26.476
That's all that matters.

33:26.510 --> 33:30.013
I suppose, now that you've seen
your father, you've probably got

33:30.047 --> 33:32.315
questions about how
you were conceived.

33:32.349 --> 33:35.819
Uh, I've got questions,
but that is not one of them.

33:35.853 --> 33:37.387
It couldn't
have been more simple.

33:37.421 --> 33:38.121
No, no. No.

33:38.155 --> 33:39.355
No, no, no, no, not listening.

33:39.390 --> 33:40.390
¶¶ La la la la la la la ¶¶

33:40.424 --> 33:42.325
See, now
you're just being rude.

33:42.359 --> 33:44.027
This is why you don't
have any friends.

33:44.061 --> 33:46.262
I have friends...
Kind of.

33:46.297 --> 33:47.931
I was at Kenny's house
when you called.

33:47.965 --> 33:49.466
He sounded
very polite.

33:49.500 --> 33:51.434
I'd love to meet him...
and your other friends.

33:51.469 --> 33:52.936
I got time tomorrow
after school.

33:52.970 --> 33:54.404
Tomorrow?!

33:54.438 --> 33:58.174
You seriously think I'm going to
go back to school tomorrow?!

33:58.209 --> 33:59.075
Like this?!

33:59.110 --> 34:00.577
What do you thinks’
going to happen?

34:00.611 --> 34:04.047
I don't know what's
going to happen, but this

34:04.081 --> 34:06.583
doesn't determine who you are.

34:06.617 --> 34:10.420
You make your own choices.

34:10.454 --> 34:11.654
Except for college.

34:11.688 --> 34:17.527
You're going to
college, no choice.

34:34.934 --> 34:37.036
Hey, hey, look...
there's the guy.

34:37.070 --> 34:38.270
There he is.

34:40.907 --> 34:42.141
Awesome, dude.

34:42.175 --> 34:45.411
You are awesome.

34:47.047 --> 34:48.480
He's so cool!

34:48.514 --> 34:49.081
Ugh!

34:50.617 --> 34:53.752
Freak.

34:54.788 --> 34:56.422
At least Troy still hates me.

34:56.456 --> 34:58.157
I was afraid I'd lost my mind.

34:58.191 --> 34:58.857
That's incredible.

34:58.892 --> 35:01.026
You should have seen...
Look... there he is.

35:01.061 --> 35:04.496
We just want to say, what you did...
wow.

35:04.531 --> 35:06.465
Uh, mind if we take a picture?

35:07.901 --> 35:09.468
Oh.

35:09.502 --> 35:11.070
What up, superstar?

35:11.104 --> 35:12.438
This is nuts.

35:12.472 --> 35:14.606
What were you telling
those two just now?

35:14.641 --> 35:17.178
Just about how you got
Belloc's attention,

35:17.203 --> 35:18.711
lured him away from the party and

35:19.112 --> 35:20.279
saved all their skins.

35:20.313 --> 35:23.148
Oh, thanks, I guess.

35:23.183 --> 35:27.619
<i>Speaking of skins, I kind of thought
everybody would be freaked out by this.</i>

35:27.654 --> 35:28.987
<i>Haven't you heard?</i>

35:29.022 --> 35:30.923
<i>Scaly is the new suede.</i>

35:30.957 --> 35:35.160
<i>You see, when Belloc nailed you
with the fire breath, your skin</i>

35:35.195 --> 35:38.030
<i>got all weird.</i>

35:38.064 --> 35:41.266
<i>Isabel, what I told you...
About Belloc.</i>

35:41.301 --> 35:43.469
<i>Jusbefore
you saved my life?</i>

35:43.503 --> 35:45.704
<i>Yeah, what about it?</i>

35:51.678 --> 35:54.913
<i>Hey, Jenna.</i>

35:54.948 --> 35:56.849
<i>What?</i>

36:01.988 --> 36:03.856
<i>I'm still here.</i>

36:03.890 --> 36:05.991
<i>Um...
I'll catch you later, Isabel.</i>

36:06.025 --> 36:08.026
<i>I- I just remembered there's
something I got to do.</i>

36:08.061 --> 36:10.095
<i>Yeah. Sure.</i>

36:12.732 --> 36:13.732
<i>There she is.</i>

36:13.766 --> 36:15.601
<i>Let's get out of here.</i>

36:28.648 --> 36:30.182
<i>Huh?</i>

36:37.790 --> 36:39.791
<i>Ohh!</i>

36:45.398 --> 36:47.232
<i>Oh!</i>

37:13.159 --> 37:15.093
<i>Hey.</i>

37:15.128 --> 37:18.030
<i>I just wanted to say
that was really amazing, you</i>

37:18.064 --> 37:19.598
<i>saving everyone and everything.</i>

37:20.667 --> 37:22.401
<i>You're a real hero.</i>

37:22.435 --> 37:24.036
<i>I just ran.</i>

37:24.070 --> 37:25.103
<i>He chased me.</i>

37:25.138 --> 37:28.373
<i>First time I leave a
party early and look what I miss.</i>

37:28.408 --> 37:30.075
<i>Totally my fault.</i>

37:30.610 --> 37:34.079
<i>- I'm... I'm really sorry I brought up...
- What? Fathers?</i>

37:34.113 --> 37:37.149
<i>It would be kind of weird if no
one talked about their dads in</i>

37:37.183 --> 37:37.883
<i>front of me.</i>

37:37.917 --> 37:40.052
<i>Lots of people have them.</i>

37:40.086 --> 37:41.520
<i>What's yours like?</i>

37:41.554 --> 37:46.024
<i>He... Travels a lot.</i>

37:46.059 --> 37:50.195
<i>So, is, uh, is homecoming
off, or what?</i>

37:51.331 --> 37:53.265
<i>No. No, it's back on.</i>

37:53.299 --> 37:56.535
<i>Turns out homecoming is
going to be big this year.</i>

37:56.569 --> 37:57.636
<i>Great.</i>

37:57.670 --> 38:00.339
<i>So, who...
who are you going with?</i>

38:01.374 --> 38:03.308
<i>Are you asking me?</i>

38:03.343 --> 38:05.844
<i>Yeah!</i>

38:06.879 --> 38:09.147
<i>I- I mean, yeah.</i>

38:09.182 --> 38:10.249
<i>I am.</i>

38:11.251 --> 38:12.217
<i>Great.</i>

38:12.252 --> 38:16.388
<i>For a minute there, I was afraid
that I'd have to ask you.</i>

38:30.336 --> 38:32.871
<i>Going for a check-up
with doc pytell doesn't usually</i>

38:32.905 --> 38:33.705
<i>make you so happy.</i>

38:33.740 --> 38:34.573
<i>I'm not.</i>

38:34.607 --> 38:36.775
<i>I doubt very much that she's
got a skin cream that can</i>

38:36.809 --> 38:37.376
<i>handle this.</i>

38:37.410 --> 38:39.745
<i>Well, then I'm
guessing it has something to do</i>

38:39.779 --> 38:41.546
<i>with taking Jenna to homecoming.</i>

38:41.581 --> 38:44.116
<i>- Yeah, how... how did you...
- I'm your guardian</i>

38:44.150 --> 38:48.687
<i>angel... I know everything, except
how you got her to say yes.</i>

38:48.721 --> 38:52.891
<i>Well, some of us got it
and some... wait, this isn't</i>

38:52.925 --> 38:53.825
<i>the way to the base.</i>

38:53.860 --> 38:56.495
<i>Thought we'd take a
little detour, see if anything</i>

38:56.529 --> 38:59.598
<i>out here'd jar your memory.</i>

38:59.632 --> 39:02.567
<i>I already told you, I
don't know where his lair is!</i>

39:02.602 --> 39:03.602
<i>Maybe.</i>

39:03.636 --> 39:06.972
<i>But I think your body'll know when
he's near and do the funky Kaiju.</i>

39:07.006 --> 39:08.640
<i>Not
happening, Barnes!</i>

39:08.675 --> 39:10.575
<i>I'm not your personal
monster detector.</i>

39:10.610 --> 39:12.210
<i>Try and
stop me, junior.</i>

39:12.245 --> 39:14.880
<i>- So dead...
- Is that a threat, boy?</i>

39:14.914 --> 39:16.581
<i>No. We're so dead.</i>

39:16.616 --> 39:20.052
Hold on!

39:20.086 --> 39:22.054
Can't hold her!

39:22.088 --> 39:25.691
Get down!

39:25.725 --> 39:26.825
Aaah!

39:26.859 --> 39:28.293
Duncan!

39:34.200 --> 39:35.534
Reach!

39:37.370 --> 39:39.738
No!

40:29.889 --> 40:31.423
Huh?

40:35.762 --> 40:36.995
This is Barnes.

40:37.029 --> 40:41.466
I want every unit we've got deployed inside
the perimeter, and I want it yesterday.

40:45.438 --> 40:47.739
Aaaah!

40:58.418 --> 40:59.618
Yes!

40:59.652 --> 41:00.419
Better.

41:00.453 --> 41:02.020
<i>What is this?</i>

41:02.054 --> 41:02.687
A test?

41:02.722 --> 41:04.556
A stupid test?!

41:20.473 --> 41:24.976
Duncan, kill the xornga,
or it will surely kill you.

41:25.011 --> 41:27.546
I don't want to fight!

41:27.580 --> 41:29.714
The Kaiju know
of your existence!

41:29.749 --> 41:33.151
Any of them may challenge your
right to succeed me at any time!

41:39.225 --> 41:41.426
I don't want
to succeed you!

41:41.461 --> 41:43.495
<i>But you do want to live.</i>

41:43.529 --> 41:46.298
Only your bloodlust
will save you!

41:55.074 --> 41:56.575
Excellent, my son!

41:56.609 --> 41:58.810
Perhaps it is not
too late for you.

42:04.484 --> 42:06.618
Finish it!

42:17.196 --> 42:19.030
Barnes!

42:19.065 --> 42:20.899
Fire!

42:23.870 --> 42:25.670
Get down!

43:02.842 --> 43:03.742
Stop it!

43:03.776 --> 43:04.409
Stop firing!

43:04.443 --> 43:05.243
You'll kill him!

43:05.278 --> 43:07.746
That's the
general idea, kid!

43:07.780 --> 43:08.847
We kill monsters!

43:08.881 --> 43:14.486
But he's my father!

43:14.520 --> 43:15.387
Please!

43:15.421 --> 43:18.156
You can stop this!

43:18.190 --> 43:21.059
Aaaah!

43:35.074 --> 43:36.207
Come on!

43:36.242 --> 43:37.375
What are you doing?

43:37.410 --> 43:39.811
Shoot! Do it now!

43:39.845 --> 43:41.846
No!

43:51.724 --> 43:53.992
I surrender.

43:54.026 --> 43:55.860
What?!

44:00.900 --> 44:02.634
Okay, boys.

44:02.668 --> 44:03.668
Wrap him up!

44:21.087 --> 44:22.954
Duncan!

44:58.190 --> 45:00.458
Oh, boy.

45:09.468 --> 45:11.970
Well.

45:12.004 --> 45:12.971
Ahem.

45:13.005 --> 45:14.205
You look nice.

45:14.240 --> 45:15.407
Oh, yeah.

45:15.441 --> 45:16.975
My mom picked out this suit.

45:17.009 --> 45:21.012
I- I think it's kind of... Oh!

45:21.047 --> 45:24.783
<i>You look nice, too.</i>

45:24.817 --> 45:27.852
You haven't been
on many dates, have you?

45:27.887 --> 45:29.421
Well, first of all, relax.

45:29.455 --> 45:32.691
And don't forget to give a
girl a little attention.

45:32.725 --> 45:35.560
Um. Yeah.

45:35.594 --> 45:36.795
Hello.

45:36.829 --> 45:40.098
Oh, look, you
brought your friends!

45:40.132 --> 45:41.466
That's so thoughtful.

45:41.500 --> 45:44.936
<i>We usually don't do school
functions, but since this</i>

45:44.970 --> 45:48.973
<i>is the first dance with a Kaiju alert
level, we didn't want to miss it.</i>

45:49.008 --> 45:51.476
<i>Any other surprises
I should know about?</i>

45:51.510 --> 45:52.577
<i>No.</i>

45:53.679 --> 45:55.680
<i>Let's get
this show on the road.</i>

45:55.715 --> 45:57.015
<i>I'm supposed to be there early.</i>

45:57.049 --> 45:58.483
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

45:58.517 --> 46:00.251
<i>Mm.</i>

46:15.734 --> 46:16.467
¶¶ Aaaaah ¶¶

46:16.502 --> 46:18.302
Easy there, chief.

46:18.337 --> 46:20.404
Save some for the after-party.

46:20.439 --> 46:21.973
Hey, there.

46:23.275 --> 46:26.444
Duncan, did your mom
just flash you the "rock on"

46:26.478 --> 46:27.278
devil horns?

46:27.312 --> 46:29.013
That's "I love you"

46:29.047 --> 46:30.047
in sign language.

46:30.082 --> 46:32.283
Oh, that's so cute.

46:32.317 --> 46:35.353
I guess the suit
clashes with orange.

46:35.387 --> 46:36.721
Everyone is staring.

46:36.755 --> 46:39.957
<i>Could you be just an
eensy-weensy bit more</i>

46:39.992 --> 46:42.527
<i>self-absorbed, please?</i>

46:42.561 --> 46:44.996
<i>Duncan is not the
centre of the universe.</i>

46:45.030 --> 46:47.498
<i>Got it.</i>

46:47.533 --> 46:49.333
<i>Come on!</i>

46:52.404 --> 46:56.741
<i>So, this is pretty cool,
right... that we came and everything?</i>

46:56.775 --> 46:58.242
<i>What is up with you?</i>

46:58.277 --> 47:01.012
<i>I'm just...
I just want to make sure you're glad...</i>

47:01.046 --> 47:03.047
<i>You're here... With me.</i>

47:03.081 --> 47:04.615
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

47:04.650 --> 47:06.617
<i>Happy to be here.</i>

47:06.652 --> 47:08.553
<i>So... You want to dance?</i>

47:08.587 --> 47:09.987
<i>No, thanks.</i>

47:10.022 --> 47:12.523
<i>I don't feel like dancing.</i>

47:23.735 --> 47:28.739
<i>And now, without further ado,
the results have been tabulated,</i>

47:28.774 --> 47:33.377
<i>and this year's homecoming king is...</i>

47:33.412 --> 47:35.713
<i>...Troy Adams.</i>

47:41.587 --> 47:42.820
<i>Big reveal time here.</i>

47:42.854 --> 47:47.858
<i>Big reveal time, but remember...
Everyone here is a winner.</i>

47:47.893 --> 47:53.598
<i>This year's Herbert Hoover high
homecoming queen is...</i>

47:53.632 --> 47:57.168
<i>...Jenna shwartzendruber!</i>

48:00.973 --> 48:03.107
<i>You've got to be kidding me!</i>

48:03.141 --> 48:04.275
<i>Yeah! Whoo!</i>

48:04.309 --> 48:08.179
<i>If the queen will please
receive her crown, she may then</i>

48:08.213 --> 48:11.616
<i>perform the coronation
dance with her king.</i>

48:11.650 --> 48:12.650
<i>No way.</i>

48:12.684 --> 48:14.318
<i>No way am I doing that to you.</i>

48:14.353 --> 48:15.286
<i>It's okay.</i>

48:15.320 --> 48:18.055
<i>No, I came with you, and
I'm going to dance with you.</i>

48:18.090 --> 48:19.857
<i>It's only one dance.</i>

48:19.891 --> 48:21.359
<i>It's
tradition, Jenna.</i>

48:21.393 --> 48:21.959
<i>You have to.</i>

48:23.462 --> 48:25.096
<i>Jenna!</i>

48:39.811 --> 48:43.080
<i>Now
I feel like dancing.</i>

48:43.115 --> 48:44.715
Come on, wallflower.

48:44.750 --> 48:45.716
Let's dance.

48:45.751 --> 48:47.184
[ Yeah yeah yeah's "runaway"

48:47.219 --> 48:47.685
plays ]

48:47.719 --> 48:50.755
¶¶... Can't help looking back ¶¶

48:50.789 --> 48:53.257
¶¶ highways flew by... ¶¶

48:53.292 --> 48:56.560
And what am I?

48:56.595 --> 48:57.828
¶¶... Run, runaway ¶¶

48:58.630 --> 48:59.297
Whoa!

48:59.331 --> 49:00.531
She came with me!

49:00.565 --> 49:01.265
Ken!

49:01.300 --> 49:02.266
What is up with you?

49:02.301 --> 49:03.067
Are you mental?

49:03.101 --> 49:06.570
No, I'm human, unlike
some people around here!

49:06.605 --> 49:07.605
Calm down.

49:07.639 --> 49:08.839
You're with friends, Kenny.

49:08.874 --> 49:09.807
Everything is cool.

49:09.841 --> 49:11.609
Everything is not cool!

49:11.643 --> 49:14.245
Ken, why don't we
go talk about this outside?

49:14.279 --> 49:15.546
It's not what you think.

49:15.580 --> 49:16.447
No!

49:16.481 --> 49:22.219
The only reason Isabel likes you is
because she knows your old man is Belloc!

49:22.254 --> 49:23.454
What?!

49:23.488 --> 49:24.922
It's not true.

49:24.956 --> 49:26.590
Is it?

49:29.194 --> 49:30.695
Jenna.

49:30.729 --> 49:32.263
Get away from me!

49:32.297 --> 49:35.232
Get away.

49:35.267 --> 49:36.133
Forget this.

49:36.168 --> 49:36.801
This is a joke.

49:36.835 --> 49:38.002
Huh?

49:38.036 --> 49:39.437
Duncan.

49:39.471 --> 49:40.805
Dad's right.

49:40.839 --> 49:41.839
I'm wasting my time here.

50:06.031 --> 50:08.632
Aahhhh!

50:23.415 --> 50:24.782
Hmph.

50:31.890 --> 50:33.357
Aah!

50:46.405 --> 50:47.938
Oh, Kenny.

50:47.973 --> 50:49.440
Why?

50:49.474 --> 50:50.775
I don't know.

50:50.809 --> 50:51.675
Don't ask me!

50:51.710 --> 50:53.344
No! I want to know!

50:54.379 --> 50:55.246
What?

50:57.749 --> 50:59.150
Kenny!

50:59.184 --> 51:00.418
What?

51:00.452 --> 51:02.386
What's going on?

51:10.095 --> 51:12.096
This isn't good.

51:14.800 --> 51:16.300
What is that?

51:19.671 --> 51:22.373
Kaiju! Aaah!

51:22.407 --> 51:25.443
There's another one!

51:45.163 --> 51:53.304
Children, please find the nearest emergency
exit and in an orderly manner... Aaaaahh!

51:53.338 --> 51:56.173
No! Ms. dreakford!

52:09.187 --> 52:09.920
Aah!

52:09.955 --> 52:11.121
Isabel!

52:12.491 --> 52:14.792
Get off!

52:21.399 --> 52:24.168
Right here, ugly!

52:28.473 --> 52:30.374
Do it!

52:37.315 --> 52:38.449
Ken!

52:42.020 --> 52:42.786
Ugh!

52:44.289 --> 52:47.658
Stay away
from my friends!

53:21.893 --> 53:25.863
Kenny!

53:25.897 --> 53:29.800
Isabel.

53:29.834 --> 53:31.068
Huh?

53:31.102 --> 53:33.470
Duncan, sorry.

53:34.105 --> 53:37.441
- I can't believe I told everyone yoyour...
- It's okay, Ken.

53:37.475 --> 53:38.509
You told the truth.

53:38.543 --> 53:40.444
You do look
real weird, man.

53:40.478 --> 53:42.880
I guess right now, that's
probably a good thing.

53:42.914 --> 53:43.681
Kenny.

53:43.715 --> 53:47.818
Let's get him clear.

53:51.356 --> 53:54.224
Aaah!

54:24.689 --> 54:27.825
Aaah! Aah!

54:27.859 --> 54:31.195
Okay, you filthy, fat freaks.

54:31.229 --> 54:33.797
Let's see you keep up.

54:47.445 --> 54:52.282
Okay, we've got two unidentified
Kaiju heading out of town, so let's move.

54:59.424 --> 55:00.824
Where are you going?

55:00.859 --> 55:02.960
I'm going
to help my son.

55:02.994 --> 55:06.230
I know you must hate
me, but let me help, too.

55:06.264 --> 55:08.098
I don't
have time for this.

55:08.133 --> 55:10.167
Get in!

55:12.771 --> 55:15.239
Whoa, this is crazy!

55:15.273 --> 55:18.273
Oh, it gets better.

55:29.954 --> 55:31.588
Ugh!

55:38.029 --> 55:41.632
And since you wanted to
come so badly, you're going to help me.

55:43.468 --> 55:46.003
Uh, where did you get that?

55:46.037 --> 55:49.606
Duncan's father gave
it to me a long time ago.

55:52.610 --> 55:54.578
Duncan.

56:02.787 --> 56:04.888
I can do this.

56:20.238 --> 56:22.106
Get that
transport loaded up.

56:22.140 --> 56:23.807
Move it, double time!

56:23.842 --> 56:25.809
And I mean speed of heat!

56:38.890 --> 56:40.491
Whoa! What's that for?

56:40.525 --> 56:45.829
Duncan's father and I
have some unresolved issues.

56:45.864 --> 56:49.266
Ready to meet Duncan's daddy?

57:08.787 --> 57:10.788
Margaret.

57:10.822 --> 57:12.823
One chance, Belloc.

57:12.857 --> 57:15.058
You haven't changed.

57:15.093 --> 57:17.561
I'm going to
ask you a question.

57:17.595 --> 57:20.164
Lie to me, and I
pull the trigger.

57:20.198 --> 57:21.732
I don't doubt it.

57:21.766 --> 57:26.336
Did you send those things
that are trying to kill Duncan?

57:26.371 --> 57:29.273
Abaddon and astaroth.

57:29.307 --> 57:30.507
Traitors.

57:30.542 --> 57:32.042
Answer the question.

57:32.076 --> 57:33.477
I did not send them.

57:33.511 --> 57:35.813
But I suspected they
might come for him.

57:35.847 --> 57:39.950
That's why I let the humans take me...
to be close, to protect him.

57:39.984 --> 57:41.451
I knew it.

57:41.486 --> 57:43.821
I'm not going to let you
take my n, you know.

57:43.855 --> 57:45.322
I know.

57:45.356 --> 57:50.427
But if he chooses to come freely,
what will you be willing to do?

57:50.461 --> 57:53.664
For now, let's just
hope we can keep him alive.

58:00.839 --> 58:02.739
Get down!

58:07.078 --> 58:09.446
Whoa!

58:09.480 --> 58:10.247
What then...?

58:10.281 --> 58:13.917
Aw, dang!

58:13.952 --> 58:17.154
Turn it around!

58:17.188 --> 58:20.724
Return to base!

58:20.758 --> 58:22.426
Aw, dang it!

58:59.831 --> 59:03.300
Here we go.

59:06.237 --> 59:09.940
That... that guy on the jetpack
looked just like my gym teacher.

59:09.974 --> 59:11.742
Come on.

59:19.451 --> 59:20.951
Aah! Huh?

59:20.986 --> 59:23.520
Get up here!

59:23.555 --> 59:25.322
<i>This is all your fault!</i>

59:25.357 --> 59:27.057
<i>Belloc is back because of you.</i>

59:27.092 --> 59:29.393
<i>- What? I haven...
- Shut it!</i>

59:29.427 --> 59:30.728
<i>Let's drop the act, junior.</i>

59:30.762 --> 59:33.063
<i>I isn’t no father figure
and you isn’t no kid.</i>

59:33.098 --> 59:34.031
<i>Kaiju!</i>

59:34.065 --> 59:35.366
<i>I know what you are.</i>

59:35.400 --> 59:37.568
<i>I saw you tear apart that
thing in the desert.</i>

59:37.602 --> 59:41.739
<i>There!</i>

59:41.773 --> 59:44.975
<i>Aaaah!</i>

59:45.010 --> 59:47.244
<i>Just hold still, buttercup.</i>

59:56.488 --> 59:58.756
<i>Barnes!</i>

01:00:01.993 --> 01:00:03.427
<i>W- w-whoa!</i>

01:00:03.461 --> 01:00:05.729
<i>Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!</i>

01:00:05.764 --> 01:00:09.066
<i>Aaah!</i>

01:00:09.100 --> 01:00:11.435
<i>Whoa!</i>

01:00:11.469 --> 01:00:13.804
<i>Flap!</i>

01:00:13.838 --> 01:00:15.839
<i>Flap harder!</i>

01:00:15.874 --> 01:00:22.112
<i>Aah! Aah!</i>

01:00:22.147 --> 01:00:23.747
<i>Oof!</i>

01:00:23.782 --> 01:00:25.516
<i>I think you'll be okay here.</i>

01:00:25.550 --> 01:00:27.451
<i>They seem pretty focused on me.</i>

01:00:27.485 --> 01:00:28.419
<i>Why?</i>

01:00:28.453 --> 01:00:29.687
<i>Why'd you save me?</i>

01:00:29.721 --> 01:00:31.855
<i>You know I need
an "a" in gym class.</i>

01:00:31.890 --> 01:00:33.557
<i>Consider this extra credit.</i>

01:00:33.591 --> 01:00:36.060
<i>They'll
probably kill you anyway.</i>

01:00:36.094 --> 01:00:39.496
<i>Before they do, I'll
be sure to tell them where they</i>

01:00:39.531 --> 01:00:41.498
<i>can grab some lunch afterwards.</i>

01:01:04.856 --> 01:01:06.557
<i>Aah! Aah!</i>

01:01:06.591 --> 01:01:08.993
<i>Aaaah!</i>

01:01:15.467 --> 01:01:17.534
<i>Dad!</i>

01:01:31.583 --> 01:01:32.449
<i>Dad!</i>

01:01:32.484 --> 01:01:33.951
<i>No!</i>

01:01:33.985 --> 01:01:34.985
<i>Strap in.</i>

01:01:35.020 --> 01:01:36.387
<i>What are you going to do?</i>

01:01:36.421 --> 01:01:37.388
<i>Help him.</i>

01:01:37.422 --> 01:01:38.122
<i>How?</i>

01:01:38.156 --> 01:01:39.323
<i>Hold on tight!</i>

01:01:39.357 --> 01:01:42.726
<i>Aaah!</i>

01:01:42.761 --> 01:01:44.294
<i>Uhh.</i>

01:01:44.329 --> 01:01:45.629
<i>Mom?</i>

01:01:49.300 --> 01:01:50.234
<i>Jenna!</i>

01:01:50.268 --> 01:01:51.702
<i>No!</i>

01:01:52.637 --> 01:01:54.905
<i>Aaaah!</i>

01:02:19.431 --> 01:02:21.832
<i>Mom!</i>

01:02:35.513 --> 01:02:37.381
<i>Ha ha!</i>

01:02:44.489 --> 01:02:45.722
<i>Fight, Duncan!</i>

01:02:45.757 --> 01:02:46.290
<i>Kill them.</i>

01:02:46.324 --> 01:02:49.259
<i>There has
to be another way.</i>

01:02:55.200 --> 01:02:57.534
<i>Be ready to move.</i>

01:03:02.807 --> 01:03:07.344
<i>Belloc!</i>

01:03:07.378 --> 01:03:10.114
<i>Aaaaah!</i>

01:03:10.148 --> 01:03:12.182
<i>Aahh!</i>

01:03:12.217 --> 01:03:14.618
<i>Aaah!</i>

01:03:49.921 --> 01:03:52.489
<i>Dad!</i>

01:03:52.524 --> 01:03:54.892
<i>Get mom!</i>

01:03:55.693 --> 01:03:57.928
<i>Uhh!</i>

01:03:57.962 --> 01:04:00.230
<i>Aaaah!</i>

01:04:35.867 --> 01:04:37.901
<i>Mom!</i>

01:05:04.034 --> 01:05:05.401
You did not kill them.

01:05:05.436 --> 01:05:07.236
I wanted to.

01:05:07.271 --> 01:05:09.305
But it wouldn't have
changed anything.

01:05:09.339 --> 01:05:11.407
<i>It would have
changed you.</i>

01:05:11.442 --> 01:05:13.776
<i>But you
did beat them.</i>

01:05:13.811 --> 01:05:16.279
I wouldn't have
thought it possible.

01:05:16.313 --> 01:05:19.849
<i>Perhaps there was value
in leaving you with your mother.</i>

01:05:24.121 --> 01:05:27.423
You don't have to
go back there to that cage.

01:05:27.458 --> 01:05:28.724
I'll free you.

01:05:28.759 --> 01:05:31.727
You will stay with your
mother for the time being.

01:05:31.762 --> 01:05:34.730
And I... Will be nearby.

01:05:57.287 --> 01:05:59.188
Holy hello, kid.

01:05:59.223 --> 01:06:00.256
What did you do to 'em?

01:06:00.290 --> 01:06:01.190
Nothing.

01:06:01.225 --> 01:06:02.191
They're cold-blooded.

01:06:02.226 --> 01:06:03.159
They're hibernating.

01:06:03.193 --> 01:06:04.894
What about you?

01:06:04.928 --> 01:06:09.499
I'm not like them.

01:06:09.533 --> 01:06:12.635
What are you geniuses
waiting for, a written invitation?

01:06:12.669 --> 01:06:14.871
Let's get these popsicles
in the freezer.

01:06:14.905 --> 01:06:15.872
Hi.

01:06:15.906 --> 01:06:16.973
Hey.

01:06:17.007 --> 01:06:19.242
So, I figured out who.

01:06:19.276 --> 01:06:21.878
Thanks for saving homecoming.

01:06:22.846 --> 01:06:25.481
Like any of that
stuff matters now.

01:06:25.516 --> 01:06:27.383
It mattered to you.

01:06:27.417 --> 01:06:30.853
So, I'll see
you at school Monday?

01:06:30.888 --> 01:06:31.954
I don't know.

01:06:31.989 --> 01:06:33.556
You still want me
to go to school?

01:06:33.590 --> 01:06:34.657
Oh, yeah.

01:06:34.691 --> 01:06:35.825
You're going to school.

01:06:35.859 --> 01:06:38.794
Then I'll see you there.

01:06:42.866 --> 01:06:46.068
- Looks like our
- You know what, mom?

01:06:46.103 --> 01:06:50.439
I think I'll find
my own way home.

01:06:55.679 --> 01:06:56.946
Whoo!

01:06:57.305 --> 01:07:03.638
