WEBVTT

00:08.176 --> 00:11.812
- And now
may the fastest rat win.

00:11.912 --> 00:13.847
- Hey, guys, we always
do the fastest rat.

00:13.947 --> 00:16.750
You know what really
says rock and roll?

00:16.850 --> 00:20.888
may the fattest rat win.

00:20.988 --> 00:23.791
- Maybe you should
stop feeding him gravy.

00:23.891 --> 00:27.528
- Don't tell me
how to raise my rat.

00:27.628 --> 00:32.633
Who's a hungry baby, huh?

00:32.733 --> 00:33.834
- Oh, hey, guys.

00:33.934 --> 00:37.171
I just booked DJ Astronaut
for the big dance.

00:37.271 --> 00:40.874
Oh, look, you
already found dates.

00:40.974 --> 00:43.144
- Hey, the band couldn't agree
on a new look, so we're deciding

00:43.244 --> 00:45.313
what to wear by racing rats.

00:45.413 --> 00:46.814
- Couldn't you
just talk it out?

00:46.914 --> 00:50.218
- But then what would
we do with the rats?

00:50.318 --> 00:51.552
- If your band has
a fashion emergency,

00:51.652 --> 00:52.586
you should just ask me.

00:52.686 --> 00:53.487
Here, what are you options?

00:53.587 --> 00:55.089
- Well, I want punk rock.

00:55.189 --> 00:57.491
- Scary skeletons.
- Robots.

00:57.591 --> 01:02.663
- Nothing put puka shells.

01:02.763 --> 01:07.901
- Well, the good news is, no
matter who wins you all lose.

01:08.001 --> 01:09.137
- Don't listen to her.

01:09.170 --> 01:11.439
You're a winner,
Danica Rat-trick.

01:11.539 --> 01:14.142
And apparently a boy.

01:14.242 --> 01:18.045
- Gentlemen, start your rats!

01:18.146 --> 01:20.881
- Oh, hold on, mine's pooping.

01:20.981 --> 01:22.550
All right, we're good.

01:29.022 --> 01:31.159
- On your mark, get set...

01:31.192 --> 01:33.060
Rat race!
- [horn blows]

01:33.161 --> 01:34.328
- Come on, Danica, run!

01:34.428 --> 01:35.663
- Come on, bring
it home, big girl!

01:35.763 --> 01:36.897
- Do it for the robots!

01:36.997 --> 01:39.933
- Don't poop, run!

01:40.033 --> 01:44.372
- Yeah!

01:44.472 --> 01:46.174
You know what this means, guys.

01:50.178 --> 01:52.380
Initiating music mode.

01:52.480 --> 01:56.817
Beep, bop, boop.

01:56.917 --> 01:59.387
- That's not how
a robot dances, Max.

01:59.487 --> 02:00.388
- I'm not dancing.

02:00.488 --> 02:01.989
My rat's loose in my costume.

02:02.089 --> 02:03.824
- [rat squeaking]

02:08.396 --> 02:10.964
- * What you see
is not what you get *

02:11.064 --> 02:14.202
* Living our lives
with a secret *

02:14.268 --> 02:17.371
* We fit right in,
bet you'd never guess *

02:17.471 --> 02:20.874
* Because we're living our
lives just like all the rest *

02:20.974 --> 02:24.578
* A picture-perfect family
is what we try to be *

02:24.678 --> 02:27.681
* But closer you might see
the crazy things we do *

02:27.781 --> 02:29.317
* This isn't make-believe

02:29.417 --> 02:30.818
* It's our reality

02:30.918 --> 02:33.821
* Just your average family
trying to be normal *

02:33.921 --> 02:35.556
* And stay out of trouble

02:35.656 --> 02:38.091
* Living a double life *

02:42.363 --> 02:44.365
- *

02:44.465 --> 02:46.267
- And here's your ticket.

02:46.367 --> 02:48.068
And your ticket.

02:48.236 --> 02:51.239
And your--wait, am I supposed
to be charging people?

02:51.305 --> 02:53.407
- [phone dings]

02:53.507 --> 02:54.675
- Oh, no.

02:54.775 --> 02:56.377
- Don't worry, I'll
get their money.

02:56.477 --> 02:58.379
- No.

02:58.479 --> 03:01.582
No, I just got an email
from DJ Astronaut.

03:01.682 --> 03:04.818
"Dear mission control, I'm too
sick to liftoff,

03:04.918 --> 03:08.155
so I wouldn't be able
to 'rocket' tonight.'"

03:08.256 --> 03:09.723
Just because he used cute
astronaut language

03:09.823 --> 03:11.892
doesn't make it better.

03:11.992 --> 03:12.793
- What are we going to do?

03:12.893 --> 03:14.161
The dance is ruined.

03:14.262 --> 03:15.663
- What?
- [indistinct chatter]

03:15.763 --> 03:17.465
- Uh, she's joking.

03:17.565 --> 03:19.032
The dance is not ruined.

03:19.132 --> 03:22.370
It's--it's gonna be off
the chain...and the hook.

03:22.470 --> 03:23.804
Even the handle.

03:23.904 --> 03:25.673
It's gonna be off
all the things.

03:30.177 --> 03:32.079
Cherry, this is
the biggest dance of the year.

03:32.179 --> 03:33.747
If people find out I messed up
the music,

03:33.847 --> 03:35.649
they'll never forgive me.

03:35.749 --> 03:39.152
- I'll make them forgive you.

03:39.287 --> 03:41.422
- Okay, you can't keep solving
problems with your shoes.

03:43.624 --> 03:46.627
Wait, I think I just figured
out a way to save the dance.

03:46.727 --> 03:48.161
Hey, Max!

03:48.296 --> 03:49.963
How would you and your band
like to play the dance tonight?

03:50.063 --> 03:51.665
- Uh, yes.

03:51.765 --> 03:53.401
- Well, there's no pay.
- Yes.

03:53.501 --> 03:54.502
- You'll have no
time to rehearse.

03:54.602 --> 03:57.538
- What part of yes
don't you understand?

03:57.638 --> 03:59.307
- Sweet-ious, this will get us
out of playing

03:59.407 --> 04:00.874
Gideon's mom's gas station.

04:00.974 --> 04:05.746
- Yeah, she was gonna pay
us in gas and tire rotations.

04:05.846 --> 04:09.182
- Sorry, Gideon, but I'd much
rather play for teenage girls

04:09.317 --> 04:10.951
than truck drivers.

04:11.051 --> 04:13.754
- Lady truck drivers.

04:13.854 --> 04:15.323
- Ladies?

04:15.423 --> 04:18.559
I'm changing my vote
back to gas station.

04:18.659 --> 04:19.860
- Looks like we're split.

04:19.960 --> 04:21.429
Only one way to settle this.

04:21.529 --> 04:22.330
- Oh, no.

04:22.363 --> 04:23.397
Please don't tell
me it's another--

04:23.497 --> 04:26.700
- Fat race!

04:26.800 --> 04:29.870
I know, it's rat race.

04:29.970 --> 04:32.105
- *

04:32.205 --> 04:35.142
- [rat squeaking]

04:35.242 --> 04:37.144
- So, Max, ready
to win that rat race?

04:37.244 --> 04:38.346
- Oh, we're not gonna win.

04:38.412 --> 04:39.513
- What?

04:39.613 --> 04:41.382
- He's never won.

04:41.482 --> 04:42.450
If you weren't so adorable,

04:42.550 --> 04:44.952
I'd be kicking you
out on the streets.

04:45.052 --> 04:46.820
- But I need your band
to save the dance.

04:46.920 --> 04:48.121
Why would you even
agree to race?

04:48.221 --> 04:49.557
- No choice.

04:49.657 --> 04:53.260
Band rule number 77, in case
of disagreement, rat race.

04:53.361 --> 04:55.128
- Your band has 77 rules?

04:55.228 --> 04:58.065
- Yeah, but rules 1 through 76
are rock hard, rock out,

04:58.165 --> 04:58.932
rock your face off, rock--

04:59.032 --> 05:00.968
- I get it.

05:01.068 --> 05:03.871
- Well, we did some good
gardening out there today, Nora.

05:03.971 --> 05:05.005
- We?

05:05.105 --> 05:07.375
You just stood
there in the shade.

05:07.475 --> 05:09.076
- It's called supervising.

05:09.176 --> 05:12.413
And I did it without a chair.

05:12.513 --> 05:15.783
- Aw, who's this
little, furry--ah!

05:15.883 --> 05:17.117
Rat!

05:17.217 --> 05:19.787
Ah...!

05:24.458 --> 05:27.995
- Max, you've got to keep that
filthy thing out of the house.

05:28.095 --> 05:31.499
- Dad, she's right here.

05:31.599 --> 05:33.233
- And she has telekinesis.

05:37.270 --> 05:37.938
- Hey, Billy.

05:38.038 --> 05:38.806
Hey, honey.

05:38.906 --> 05:41.775
Hello, ice cream.

05:41.875 --> 05:43.210
- It's for Billy.

05:43.310 --> 05:45.112
We decided that ice cream
was better

05:45.212 --> 05:46.914
than joining the track team.

05:47.014 --> 05:48.616
- You decided.

05:48.716 --> 05:51.752
I wanted to join the team so I
could super speed and win races.

05:51.852 --> 05:53.120
- Billy, if we're gonna
live in Hiddenville,

05:53.220 --> 05:55.022
we all have to hide something.

05:55.122 --> 05:57.425
Like Max and Phoebe's
telekinesis

05:57.525 --> 05:59.259
or your father's super strength
or--

05:59.427 --> 06:01.429
- Your mother's snoring.

06:02.663 --> 06:05.866
Oh, you were talking
about super powers.

06:05.966 --> 06:10.337
- I'm the fastest kid in
the world, and no one knows.

06:10.438 --> 06:11.939
- I feel bad.

06:12.039 --> 06:13.541
- Ah, he'll come around.

06:13.641 --> 06:15.709
He's learned two
valuable lessons today.

06:15.809 --> 06:18.278
Living in Hiddenville requires
sacrifices

06:18.446 --> 06:22.950
and never leave your ice cream
unattended.

06:23.050 --> 06:25.586
Let me show you all the hard
work I did in the garden.

06:29.056 --> 06:30.991
- Interesting.

06:31.091 --> 06:33.461
Billy wants to win races.

06:33.494 --> 06:35.463
We've got a race to win.

06:35.563 --> 06:37.498
- Yeah, okay, but even
your friends might notice

06:37.598 --> 06:39.833
that Billy's not a rat.

06:39.933 --> 06:42.570
- He could be a rat if we
shot him with the animalyzer.

06:42.670 --> 06:44.705
Dad used it to turn Dr. Colosso
into a rabbit.

06:44.805 --> 06:47.475
We could use it
to turn Billy into a rat.

06:47.541 --> 06:49.843
If only we knew where it was.

06:49.943 --> 06:52.480
- I know where it is.

06:52.513 --> 06:55.716
- Wow, remind me never
to tell you a secret.

06:55.816 --> 06:56.316
Tell me where.

06:56.484 --> 06:57.084
- I can't.

06:57.184 --> 06:58.218
Dad would kill us.

06:58.318 --> 06:59.487
That thing is
extremely dangerous.

06:59.520 --> 07:00.721
It's the kitchen.

07:03.290 --> 07:05.959
Why do I keep doing that?

07:06.059 --> 07:08.328
- Because you know it's
the right thing to do.

07:08.496 --> 07:09.530
When we were Billy's age,

07:09.630 --> 07:10.798
we could use our powers
whenever we wanted.

07:10.898 --> 07:13.133
We didn't have to hide a thing.

07:13.233 --> 07:14.502
- You're right.

07:14.568 --> 07:17.505
We'd be bad siblings
if we didn't turn into a rat.

07:17.605 --> 07:18.739
- That's the spirit.

07:18.839 --> 07:23.811
Now come on, Phoebe, make
with the blabby blab.

07:23.911 --> 07:25.078
- It's in the top cabinet
next to the frig.

07:25.178 --> 07:28.048
Just grab the can
of brussels sprouts and pull.

07:28.148 --> 07:31.351
Ah, that felt good.

07:31.519 --> 07:33.153
- Brussels sprouts?

07:39.292 --> 07:41.361
The animalyzer!

07:41.529 --> 07:45.533
It's beautiful!

07:45.599 --> 07:47.200
But how'd you figure that out?

07:48.301 --> 07:52.205
- Chips, cookies,
brussels sprouts.

07:58.812 --> 08:02.616
- You picked brussels sprouts
over chips?

08:02.716 --> 08:04.585
- They're like
little baby cabbages.

08:04.685 --> 08:06.019
Come on, name a cuter food.

08:06.119 --> 08:07.621
- Apricots.

08:07.721 --> 08:11.258
- Oh my gosh, yes,
they're baby peaches.

08:11.358 --> 08:13.326
- *

08:14.995 --> 08:18.098
- And that is how you can use
your powers to win a race

08:18.198 --> 08:18.932
right here in Hiddenville.

08:19.032 --> 08:20.801
- A rate race?

08:20.901 --> 08:22.169
- We know it's not the same
but--

08:22.269 --> 08:23.436
- It's even better.

08:23.571 --> 08:26.874
And it takes care
of two dreams at once!

08:26.974 --> 08:28.576
- You've dreamed
of becoming a rat?

08:28.609 --> 08:30.844
- He agreed, let it go.

08:30.944 --> 08:32.212
- And don't worry, Billy.

08:32.312 --> 08:34.982
The animalyzer can turn
you back into a human.

08:35.082 --> 08:39.720
To demonstrate, Max
will now use it on me.

08:39.820 --> 08:41.254
- Not happening, Colosso.

08:41.354 --> 08:43.924
- But I want to be a man again.

08:44.024 --> 08:45.893
- [laughing]

08:45.993 --> 08:49.797
- Oh, he used to be a person.

08:49.897 --> 08:52.666
All right, Billy, you have to
promise not to tell mom and dad.

08:52.766 --> 08:56.303
- My rat gills will be sealed.

08:56.403 --> 08:57.771
- He knows what
a rat is, right?

08:57.871 --> 08:59.673
- He's about to find out.

09:05.312 --> 09:07.748
- [electricity zapping]

09:11.785 --> 09:13.621
- BILLY: Oh, man,
it didn't work.

09:13.721 --> 09:16.423
You guys just made
the room really big.

09:16.523 --> 09:18.058
- Yep, still Billy.

09:19.259 --> 09:20.861
- All right, Nora, are you
ready to deal

09:20.961 --> 09:22.529
with your fear of rats?

09:22.630 --> 09:23.664
- Why should I?

09:23.764 --> 09:25.866
Isn't it normal
to be afraid of rats?

09:25.966 --> 09:28.802
- Yes, but...you're
a superhero, and you'll have

09:28.902 --> 09:31.471
to face a lot of rat-themed
villains someday--

09:31.639 --> 09:33.974
Professor Pack Rat,
Rat-a-tat-tat,

09:34.074 --> 09:35.909
Tommy the Cheese Eater,
Red-eyed Ricky.

09:36.009 --> 09:37.711
- Franken-rat,
Rat-zilla, Rat-sophe--

09:37.811 --> 09:38.812
- I get it!

09:38.912 --> 09:40.814
Face my fears.

09:40.914 --> 09:43.651
- Max, would it be okay if
Nora pets one of the rats?

09:43.751 --> 09:46.787
- Sure.

09:46.887 --> 09:48.922
- [inaudible scream]

09:49.022 --> 09:50.357
- What is she doing?

09:50.457 --> 09:53.661
- I think she's screaming
at a frequency we can't hear.

09:53.727 --> 09:56.296
- [glass shatters]

09:56.396 --> 10:00.668
- Well, she's certainly
ready to fight Glassman.

10:00.768 --> 10:01.669
- Let's go get Billy.

10:01.769 --> 10:02.703
Maybe he can calm her down.

10:02.803 --> 10:05.238
- No, no, don't!

10:05.338 --> 10:07.307
Uh, we just spoke to him.

10:07.407 --> 10:10.143
He's still upset and doesn't
want to talk to you guys yet.

10:10.243 --> 10:12.680
- Yeah, we'll tell you when
he's changed back--

10:12.780 --> 10:14.314
changed his mind.

10:15.983 --> 10:18.852
- Hey, Max, your rat's gonna
get his tail handed to him,

10:18.952 --> 10:22.022
and you're gonna rock out
at my mom's gas station.

10:22.122 --> 10:24.424
- The only gas we're gonna get
is gas from the chili

10:24.524 --> 10:26.293
at the school dance.

10:26.393 --> 10:28.528
- BILLY: Nice one, Max.

10:28.628 --> 10:29.596
- Who said that?

10:29.697 --> 10:30.731
- Who said what?

10:30.831 --> 10:31.531
- "Nice one, Max."

10:31.631 --> 10:33.834
- Thanks, Angus.

10:33.934 --> 10:34.735
- This is getting weird.

10:34.835 --> 10:36.503
Let's just race.

10:36.603 --> 10:39.907
- Okay, it's go time.

10:40.007 --> 10:41.141
- [rats squeaking]

10:44.778 --> 10:47.014
- On your mark, get set--

10:47.114 --> 10:51.852
- Rat race!
- [horn honks]

10:51.952 --> 10:53.854
- That's the fastest
rat in the world.

10:53.954 --> 10:56.423
What kind of gravy
do you feed him?

10:56.523 --> 10:58.058
- Way to go, Billy!

10:58.158 --> 10:59.960
- What race car
driver's named Billy?

11:00.060 --> 11:03.396
- Uh, the kind that wins.

11:03.496 --> 11:04.732
- Billy!

11:04.765 --> 11:08.001
- ALL: Billy! Billy! Billy!

11:08.101 --> 11:11.204
Billy! Billy! Billy!

11:11.304 --> 11:12.539
- Billy, you saved the dance.

11:12.639 --> 11:13.874
- Yeah, you were great, buddy.

11:13.974 --> 11:14.842
- BILLY: I know.

11:14.942 --> 11:16.777
Everyone was chanting my name.

11:16.877 --> 11:19.847
This is the best day of my life.

11:19.947 --> 11:21.882
- It's almost too bad
we have to turn you back.

11:21.982 --> 11:23.116
- BILLY: Then don't.

11:23.216 --> 11:25.518
I finally used my super speed
to win a race.

11:25.618 --> 11:28.555
I don't want to go back
to hiding my powers.

11:28.655 --> 11:30.423
- Sorry, buddy, but if dad
found out Phoebe and I

11:30.523 --> 11:33.460
used the animalyzer, he'd
turn us into rats.

11:33.560 --> 11:34.762
- BILLY: Cool.

11:34.828 --> 11:37.765
Then we could race and I could
kick your little rat butts.

11:37.865 --> 11:40.633
- All right, I'm glad you had
your fun, but it's over now.

11:40.768 --> 11:41.501
- BILLY: Not for me.

11:41.601 --> 11:43.036
See ya, suckas!

11:46.206 --> 11:47.107
- Billy!

11:47.207 --> 11:48.541
- Billy!

11:48.641 --> 11:50.343
- BOTH: Billy!

11:54.214 --> 11:55.415
- Billy?

11:55.515 --> 11:56.784
You can't stay a rat forever.

11:56.884 --> 11:57.785
Come on out and--

11:57.885 --> 11:59.452
- Phoebe!
- Ah!

12:00.954 --> 12:01.922
- I'm not a rat.

12:02.022 --> 12:05.458
- Eh.

12:05.558 --> 12:07.560
Max, I'm getting nervous.

12:07.660 --> 12:09.496
If mom and dad find out about
Billy, you won't get to play

12:09.596 --> 12:12.299
the dance and I won't get
to save the dance.

12:12.399 --> 12:15.135
- There he is.

12:15.235 --> 12:16.804
I think he's drawn
to your endless whining.

12:16.904 --> 12:18.705
Keep being annoying.

12:18.806 --> 12:20.808
- BILLY: You'll never
catch me, slow humans.

12:20.908 --> 12:22.275
[laughs]

12:26.814 --> 12:27.580
Give it up.

12:27.680 --> 12:29.917
I'm the fastest rat
in the world.

12:30.017 --> 12:30.951
- He's right, Max.

12:31.051 --> 12:32.585
We should just let him
live as a rat forever.

12:32.685 --> 12:33.921
[whispers] Get the animalyzer.

12:34.021 --> 12:36.223
- BILLY: You're not
using that thing on me.

12:36.323 --> 12:37.557
- Wait, you heard that?

12:37.657 --> 12:40.227
- BILLY: My ears are so big,
I can hear birds fart.

12:40.327 --> 12:41.728
You think I'm
gonna give that up?

12:44.131 --> 12:45.833
- Wait, Billy!

12:45.866 --> 12:47.567
What does it sound like?

12:50.203 --> 12:52.072
- BARB: There's no need
to fear rats.

12:52.172 --> 12:55.843
Take it from me, Randy Rat.

12:55.876 --> 12:57.510
- Really, mom, a puppet?

12:57.610 --> 13:00.080
- BARB: I'm not a puppet,
I'm your friend.

13:00.180 --> 13:01.314
- Can it, Randy.

13:01.414 --> 13:03.383
- BARB: Got it.

13:03.483 --> 13:05.118
Got it.

13:05.218 --> 13:06.553
- You guys had three kids
before me,

13:06.653 --> 13:09.857
and this is the best you can do?

13:09.890 --> 13:10.858
- Ugh.

13:10.958 --> 13:13.961
- Well, hey, they're
your kids, too.

13:14.061 --> 13:18.165
- [whispers] Barb, I was talking
about that rat over there.

13:18.265 --> 13:19.699
- Uh-oh.

13:19.867 --> 13:22.870
Okay, I'm just done with this.

13:22.903 --> 13:27.107
- Max's little races must
be attracting wild rats.

13:27.207 --> 13:28.876
I got this.

13:28.909 --> 13:30.410
- [rat squeaks]

13:30.510 --> 13:33.881
- Hank, you scared
it into the house.

13:33.914 --> 13:35.883
- [in squeaky voice]
Don't blame, Hank.

13:35.983 --> 13:39.719
He tries so hard
to make you happy.

13:39.887 --> 13:40.787
[in normal voice] Thanks, Randy.

13:40.888 --> 13:41.889
- Okay, now--

13:41.955 --> 13:45.492
- Ow, his head.

13:45.592 --> 13:46.994
- Great idea, Phoebe.

13:47.094 --> 13:49.396
If rat Billy wants to play
with all this cool stuff,

13:49.496 --> 13:50.931
he'll have to turn back
into boy Billy.

13:51.031 --> 13:52.065
Genius.

13:52.165 --> 13:54.935
- Yeah, thanks, but why
I am carrying everything?

13:55.035 --> 13:56.069
- Will you save
your whining for when

13:56.169 --> 13:57.704
we're trying to catch Billy?

14:03.110 --> 14:06.013
Uh...Phoebe.

14:06.113 --> 14:08.281
- Ah!

14:08.381 --> 14:12.252
- I get that a lot.

14:12.352 --> 14:14.121
- Mom, who is this?

14:14.221 --> 14:15.588
- The exterminator.

14:15.688 --> 14:16.957
- Darryl the rat man.

14:17.057 --> 14:21.061
If they're a crawlin',
Darryl comes a callin'.

14:21.161 --> 14:23.796
I also teach yoga.

14:23.931 --> 14:26.466
- Your rat race
attracted wild rats.

14:26.566 --> 14:32.039
- So if you want to catch a rat,
you gotta think like a rat...

14:32.139 --> 14:34.574
and put on your rat hat.

14:37.777 --> 14:41.781
- Okay, rat man's insane.

14:41.949 --> 14:43.984
- Mom, dad, you can't do this.

14:44.084 --> 14:44.952
- Why not?

14:44.985 --> 14:48.488
- Because rats are people, too.

14:48.588 --> 14:50.958
[whispers] Some
more than others.

14:50.991 --> 14:53.560
- That's why the rat man always
carries rat friendly traps.

14:53.660 --> 14:54.794
- Oh, good.

14:54.962 --> 14:58.431
- But I left those at home,
so I got these.

14:58.531 --> 15:00.400
The old snap and crack.

15:00.500 --> 15:03.170
- [snaps]

15:03.270 --> 15:06.974
- Now, stay out of the danger
zone, unless you're a rat.

15:07.040 --> 15:10.377
In which case, come on down!

15:10.477 --> 15:12.045
- You wanna hear
the real crazy part?

15:12.145 --> 15:13.113
I didn't call him.

15:13.213 --> 15:16.249
He just showed up.

15:16.349 --> 15:18.251
- 'Cause I'm the rat man.

15:21.788 --> 15:22.855
- I better warn Billy.

15:22.990 --> 15:24.224
I think he's still in his room.

15:24.324 --> 15:26.426
- Actually, he's in my lair.

15:26.526 --> 15:27.427
Yeah, we'll tell him.

15:27.527 --> 15:28.461
Come on, Phoebe.

15:28.561 --> 15:30.863
- Careful of the danger zone.

15:30.998 --> 15:34.001
- Actually, I'm more concerned
about the crazy zone.

15:37.237 --> 15:38.138
- Billy!

15:38.238 --> 15:39.706
- Rat boy!

15:39.806 --> 15:44.011
- COLOSSO: Over here.

15:44.111 --> 15:45.878
Uh, I'm Billy.

15:46.013 --> 15:48.048
Turn me back into a human.

15:48.148 --> 15:53.020
Two plus two is six
and other dumb stuff like that.

15:53.120 --> 15:55.322
- Max, look.

15:55.422 --> 15:57.490
- Billy, we see you.

15:57.590 --> 15:58.625
- You're in danger.

15:58.725 --> 16:00.093
There's an exterminator
in the house.

16:00.193 --> 16:03.196
- BILLY: Wow,
I'm really scared.

16:03.296 --> 16:05.232
- You don't know what
an exterminator is, do you?

16:05.332 --> 16:06.799
- BILLY: I do not.

16:06.899 --> 16:08.568
- It's a guy who catches rats.

16:08.668 --> 16:09.702
- BILLY: Well, good luck,

16:09.802 --> 16:13.940
because I'm the world's
fastest rat.

16:14.041 --> 16:16.443
I told you you
couldn't catch me.

16:16.543 --> 16:20.180
- Hey, Billy, we just wanted to
thank you for winning that race,

16:20.280 --> 16:23.716
so we got you some gifts--video
games, boogie board.

16:23.816 --> 16:24.851
- A bunch of other stuff

16:24.951 --> 16:27.920
you need opposable thumbs
to play with.

16:28.055 --> 16:29.722
- BILLY: Nice try,
but I'm not going back.

16:29.822 --> 16:33.760
Not when I can win races, climb
walls and chew through cement.

16:33.860 --> 16:35.062
- Why are you chewing
through cement?

16:35.095 --> 16:35.828
- BILLY: Because I can.

16:35.928 --> 16:38.565
- Fair enough.

16:38.665 --> 16:41.401
- Hey, have you guys seen Billy?

16:41.501 --> 16:43.636
Ah, rat!

16:43.736 --> 16:45.205
- Ow!

16:45.305 --> 16:47.107
- Nora, get out of here before
you hit something I care about.

16:51.144 --> 16:53.813
- BILLY: Nora's afraid of me?

16:53.913 --> 16:55.882
- Uh, of course she is.

16:55.982 --> 16:57.717
Nora's afraid of all rats.

16:57.817 --> 16:59.119
- But who needs Nora when
you've got

16:59.219 --> 17:01.754
all that cement to chew through?

17:01.854 --> 17:05.892
- BILLY: Cement is the chicken
of construction materials.

17:05.992 --> 17:09.196
But I don't want my sister
to be afraid of me.

17:09.296 --> 17:11.731
- Well, then I think
you know what we have to do.

17:11.831 --> 17:13.233
- BILLY: Turn Nora
into a rat, too?

17:13.333 --> 17:14.934
- Billy.

17:15.102 --> 17:18.471
- BILLY: Okay, I'll
change back...for Nora.

17:18.571 --> 17:20.407
- Thank you.

17:23.843 --> 17:29.449
- BILLY: Mm, string cheese.

17:29.549 --> 17:31.384
- No, Billy, don't.

17:31.484 --> 17:33.553
It's a trap.

17:33.653 --> 17:37.790
I tried.

17:37.890 --> 17:38.958
- That's it, ratty.

17:39.126 --> 17:41.994
Chase the cheese.

17:42.129 --> 17:47.234
Thanks for the tip,
terrified girl.

17:47.334 --> 17:48.168
- All right.

17:48.268 --> 17:50.237
And we are a go to animalize.

17:50.337 --> 17:52.139
Let's change Billy back
and get to that dance.

17:52.172 --> 17:55.175
- All right,
Billy, we're ready.

17:55.275 --> 17:56.042
Billy?

17:56.143 --> 17:58.711
- DARRYL: Ha, ha, gotcha rat.

17:58.811 --> 18:00.247
- BOTH: Rat man!

18:04.016 --> 18:07.520
- Must get animalyzer.

18:07.620 --> 18:10.690
Almost...uh!

18:10.790 --> 18:11.791
[sighs]

18:11.891 --> 18:14.194
I'm never getting out of here.

18:14.294 --> 18:16.363
- We gotta stop him!

18:16.463 --> 18:18.365
- [snapping]

18:18.465 --> 18:21.033
- [in slow motion]
Oh, no, danger zone!

18:21.168 --> 18:23.770
- [in slow motion]
Now who's whining?

18:33.213 --> 18:35.548
- Nora, we need your help.

18:35.648 --> 18:38.084
- I'd say so.

18:38.185 --> 18:40.220
- We used dad's animalyzer
to turn Billy into a rat

18:40.320 --> 18:41.554
so he could win a race.

18:41.654 --> 18:44.524
- We'd save him, but we
just got snapped and cracked.

18:44.624 --> 18:45.992
- You're the only one
who can do it.

18:46.092 --> 18:47.227
- Except mom and dad.

18:47.327 --> 18:48.728
But we're not telling them,
because, you know,

18:48.828 --> 18:50.930
we turned Billy into a rat.

18:51.030 --> 18:53.966
- You guys are just saying it's
Billy so that I'll face my fear.

18:54.066 --> 18:55.335
Who put you up to this?

18:55.435 --> 18:57.103
Mom, dad?

18:57.204 --> 19:00.106
It was that puppet, wasn't it?

19:00.207 --> 19:03.210
- Nora, would I lie to you?

19:03.276 --> 19:05.278
Would Phoebe lie to you?

19:05.378 --> 19:08.281
- Seriously, Nora,
that rat is Billy.

19:08.381 --> 19:09.349
- Phew, like Billy
would be dumb enough

19:09.449 --> 19:12.685
to let you two turn him
into a rat.

19:12.785 --> 19:16.756
Billy, I'm coming!

19:16.856 --> 19:19.726
- Thank you so much
for catching that thing.

19:19.826 --> 19:23.830
- I guess you owe it
all to your fancy hat.

19:23.930 --> 19:26.132
- Are you mocking the rat hat?

19:26.233 --> 19:26.966
- What?

19:27.066 --> 19:28.601
No.

19:28.701 --> 19:30.237
A little.

19:31.971 --> 19:33.906
- Wait, you can't
take him away!

19:34.006 --> 19:35.007
- Who, the rat?

19:35.107 --> 19:36.343
- Yeah.

19:36.443 --> 19:39.812
I...want to keep him, as a pet.

19:39.912 --> 19:41.448
- But you're afraid of rats.

19:41.548 --> 19:44.617
- And you said I needed
to face my fear.

19:44.717 --> 19:46.553
So here it goes.

19:49.789 --> 19:51.491
You better be Billy.

19:56.263 --> 20:00.267
Yah, I'm over my fear.

20:00.333 --> 20:03.002
- BILLY: Thanks, Nora.

20:03.102 --> 20:05.672
- Wow, honey, good for you.

20:05.772 --> 20:07.874
- Uh, folks, I don't think
you want to keep a wild rat.

20:07.974 --> 20:10.310
- Back off, rat man!

20:15.482 --> 20:17.183
- Thanks for your help, Nora.

20:17.284 --> 20:18.651
- Ow!

20:18.751 --> 20:21.421
- That's for turning
my brother into a rat.

20:21.521 --> 20:22.822
- Don't be mad at them, Nora.

20:22.922 --> 20:24.491
I wanted to do it.

20:24.591 --> 20:26.493
- Are you going
to miss racing, Billy?

20:26.593 --> 20:27.427
- Yeah.

20:27.527 --> 20:31.163
But not as much
as I would miss you.

20:31.264 --> 20:34.667
At least I can still
hear bird farts.

20:34.767 --> 20:36.235
- Not a bird, kid.

20:36.336 --> 20:39.872
- [clicks teeth]

20:39.972 --> 20:41.474
- Hey, Max, how're you doing?

20:41.574 --> 20:43.276
You think you'll be able
to play the dance tonight?

20:43.376 --> 20:46.012
- Maybe if I ice up my
fingers I won't feel the pain.

20:46.112 --> 20:50.650
- [blows air]

20:50.750 --> 20:54.587
- * Ow, ow, ow

20:54.687 --> 20:56.989
- I guess that means no music,
which makes me the girl

20:57.089 --> 20:58.825
who ruined the dance.

20:58.925 --> 21:01.328
- Unless there's no dance.

21:04.230 --> 21:05.598
Billy,

21:05.698 --> 21:10.202
how'd you like
to be a rat one last time?

21:10.337 --> 21:12.839
- *

21:22.349 --> 21:23.683
- Phoebe, where's Max?

21:23.783 --> 21:26.118
- Yeah, the dance is about to
start, and I'm not doing this

21:26.218 --> 21:28.388
if he doesn't have to.

21:28.488 --> 21:30.590
- [in computer voice]
Initiating freak-out mode.

21:30.690 --> 21:33.259
[in normal voice]
I'm freaking out!

21:33.360 --> 21:35.395
- We are never getting girls.

21:35.495 --> 21:37.864
- Okay, guys, no need to panic.

21:37.964 --> 21:41.568
- [screaming]

21:57.384 --> 22:01.187
- Nice job, Billy.

22:01.388 --> 22:04.424
Oh, hey, Billy.

22:04.524 --> 22:06.393
You're not Billy.

22:06.493 --> 22:07.927
Eh.

22:12.264 --> 22:17.837
- *
