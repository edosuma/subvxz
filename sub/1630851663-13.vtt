that air pressure.

is a solid plastic wall,

getting through it.
So it'll never go past here.

the air is directed down.

he has a high degree of
confidence in the patent

of how unique this is.

What do you sell it for,
Mark?

24:34.239 --> 24:35.474

Wholesale is $6.

Retail and direct
is $11.99.

to make it?

$12,000 is actually nothing.

it's more a reflection

the true market sentiment so ‐‐

No, so we put in
about 16K each, so it's ‐‐

25:30.229 --> 25:33.966

was less than $2,000.

you're on to something,

other things

Is there another product

We think the roadmap
within this product is huge.

of 5,000 blue Blowzees.
