WEBVTT

00:10.100 --> 00:11.220
We want our father back,

00:12.000 --> 00:13.030
no questions asked.

00:13.050 --> 00:16.000
Until we get that gun back,
we're not doing anything.

00:16.020 --> 00:18.050
By now you know what
these people are capable of.

00:18.070 --> 00:20.170
You did this to us!
You took my wife.

00:20.190 --> 00:23.010
I will not allow you
to take my daughter as well!

00:23.030 --> 00:25.040
A reporter called
looking for an official comment

00:25.060 --> 00:26.200
on an exposé on cop gangs.

00:26.220 --> 00:28.040
Who's the source?

00:28.060 --> 00:29.210
I didn't go to that reporter.
He came to me.

00:29.230 --> 00:31.090
And that makes it OK?

00:31.110 --> 00:34.020
Anything you need,
I'm down for the Ravens.

00:34.040 --> 00:36.180
We know you're running protection
for the Mexican cartel.

00:36.200 --> 00:39.210
There's nothing you or the Colombians
can offer that will change that.

00:39.230 --> 00:42.040
We'll do almost anything
to protect our family.

00:42.060 --> 00:44.090
My father is being held
at the border.

00:44.110 --> 00:46.080
Sit on the perimeter,
keep an eye out.

00:46.100 --> 00:48.050
No one pulls a trigger
unless we have to.

00:52.190 --> 00:55.140
-I had it handled!
-Next time it goes in you.

01:31.000 --> 01:33.140
-You were told to wait outside.
-I heard gunshots.

01:33.160 --> 01:35.010
Did you see what happened?

01:36.040 --> 01:39.010
-Did you see what happened?
-No.

01:49.220 --> 01:51.060
Aw, shit!

01:58.210 --> 01:59.230
How?

02:00.010 --> 02:02.050
He turned his back
on the wrong guy.

02:04.160 --> 02:06.180
We got no time for this!

02:06.200 --> 02:08.230
-We gotta get the hell out of here.
-Yeah, we do.

02:13.090 --> 02:14.180
Let's go. Come on! Move!

02:16.050 --> 02:17.100
Vamonos.

02:24.050 --> 02:25.100
Let's move!

02:27.150 --> 02:29.050
You wanted in?

02:32.010 --> 02:34.000
Now you are.

03:02.170 --> 03:05.170
- Eli must have sold us out.
- Yeah, but we did the job,

03:05.190 --> 03:07.230
-so we're owed.
-The deal was we deliver Ignacio.

03:08.010 --> 03:10.040
Until we do,
we're not gettin' shit.

03:10.060 --> 03:12.080
I'm losing patience
with these fuckers.

03:17.060 --> 03:18.160
Keep an eye on him.

03:18.180 --> 03:21.030
Let me know if he starts
planning anything stupid.

04:14.180 --> 04:16.010
Sí, señora.

04:20.150 --> 04:21.200
Ricardo...

04:26.200 --> 04:27.200
No.

04:48.020 --> 04:49.180
Shit stings.

04:54.230 --> 04:56.180
Just remember, what Ravens do

04:56.200 --> 04:59.090
is Ravens' business.

04:59.110 --> 05:01.010
No one else's.

05:23.010 --> 05:24.030
Are we good?

05:25.030 --> 05:26.130
Meadow.

05:31.100 --> 05:34.130
You keep your mouth shut,
we're good.

05:38.220 --> 05:40.100
I will.

05:42.060 --> 05:43.150
I will.

05:54.150 --> 05:57.010
-Cheers.
-Yeah.

06:02.230 --> 06:04.220
Carl's askin' for visits.
Want a burger.

06:05.000 --> 06:06.120
-Make sure he gets one.
- Why me?

06:06.140 --> 06:08.040
'Cause he knows you don't like him.

06:08.060 --> 06:10.060
To a guy like Carl,
it makes it taste better.

06:13.180 --> 06:16.110
Kraley's tellin' them
the Colombians stiffed us.

06:26.160 --> 06:30.070
I was just tellin' 'em,
with people not paying what's owed...

06:30.090 --> 06:33.070
it's not so easy
keeping the club flush.

06:33.090 --> 06:37.100
So if these Colombians
wanna screw with us,

06:37.120 --> 06:39.120
we should send 'em a message.

06:41.170 --> 06:43.060
What do you think?

06:43.080 --> 06:45.230
I think we got enough problems.

06:46.010 --> 06:48.060
We don't need fresh ones.

06:58.190 --> 07:01.140
You better not be calling to cancel
my visit with Veronica tomorrow.

07:01.160 --> 07:04.120
She's sick. She has a sore throat.

07:04.140 --> 07:07.040
Then I'll see her
while she's sick, then.

07:07.060 --> 07:09.100
I didn't call to only tell you that, Pete.

07:09.120 --> 07:12.180
-Then what'd you call for?
- To talk.

07:12.200 --> 07:15.050
You're tearing her apart, Pete.

07:15.070 --> 07:18.070
She needs space to process things.

07:18.090 --> 07:20.060
I think it'd be better if you--

07:20.080 --> 07:22.100
Whoa. No, no, no, no.
No, no, no, no, no.

07:22.120 --> 07:24.050
Don't you go there.

07:25.200 --> 07:28.170
You don't get to use her
as a way to punish me.

07:28.190 --> 07:30.000
You hear me?

07:31.060 --> 07:33.190
So tomorrow, Tuesday?

07:33.210 --> 07:35.190
Pete, it's really unfair, and I think--

07:35.210 --> 07:38.150
Listen, I gotta go.

08:00.140 --> 08:03.210
It says the police commission's
moving forward with the investigation.

08:03.230 --> 08:06.180
Get with Pastor Greg, come up with
another outreach event.

08:06.200 --> 08:08.210
Something wholesome.
Buy us some good will

08:08.230 --> 08:11.150
we can leverage when we deny
the commission's allegations.

08:11.170 --> 08:13.140
-Don't waste your fuckin' time.
-Like always,

08:13.160 --> 08:15.120
you got an opinion, but no solution.

08:15.140 --> 08:18.000
Flippin' burgers and handing out flyers
is not a fuckin' solution.

08:18.020 --> 08:19.060
They didn't mention you?

08:19.080 --> 08:20.210
Mother must have had
had a change of heart.

08:20.230 --> 08:22.230
- Or a fist to the face.
- Same thing.

08:23.010 --> 08:24.040
We gotta get ahead of this.

08:24.060 --> 08:27.210
You two go dig up some dirt
on this piece-of-shit reporter.

08:27.230 --> 08:30.100
It's a little too late to try
to discredit him, Kraley.

08:30.120 --> 08:32.130
Discrediting him
is not what we're after.

08:32.150 --> 08:34.200
We need his new source.

08:34.220 --> 08:36.120
Where ya goin'?

08:37.180 --> 08:38.230
Cartel owes us a payday.

08:39.010 --> 08:43.000
If we have to ride out an investigation,
we're gonna need one.

08:43.020 --> 08:45.120
We've already been over this.

08:45.140 --> 08:47.170
Ricardo ain't gonna pay
till we hand over his father.

08:47.190 --> 08:49.070
We'll see about that.

09:13.070 --> 09:15.200
Wake up, man.

09:19.010 --> 09:21.140
I oughta take this pillow

09:21.160 --> 09:23.090
and just right on the...

09:23.200 --> 09:26.010
Try it and I'll get out of this bed
and whoop your ass.

09:28.010 --> 09:29.160
Here, man, eat up.

09:29.180 --> 09:31.140
Mm.

09:52.090 --> 09:54.010
Does your friend need something?

09:54.030 --> 09:57.060
Yeah. His catheter slipped out.

09:57.080 --> 10:00.230
No matter how much I try,
I just can't get it back in.

10:01.010 --> 10:02.120
He doesn't have a catheter.

10:03.180 --> 10:07.100
I guess that would be the reason
why he keeps fighting me so much.

10:07.120 --> 10:10.080
Listen, I tried calling you.

10:10.100 --> 10:12.030
Yeah, well, I've been busy.

10:12.050 --> 10:13.190
No, you haven't.

10:14.220 --> 10:17.130
You could have at least sent me a text.

10:17.150 --> 10:20.150
I looked like a fool
sitting there waiting for you.

10:20.170 --> 10:22.070
It was work.

10:23.160 --> 10:26.180
Look, I'm sorry, Amber.
I really am.

10:29.190 --> 10:31.160
Can I make it up to you?

10:32.170 --> 10:34.010
Hmm?

10:36.190 --> 10:38.170
I don't give second chances.

10:44.200 --> 10:47.120
But for you, I'll make an exception.

11:05.170 --> 11:09.070
Good. I could use an extra hand.

11:09.090 --> 11:11.060
The library closes in a couple hours.

11:12.150 --> 11:14.090
It's gettin' late.

11:14.110 --> 11:16.060
I'll be fine.

11:17.220 --> 11:21.200
How about if I walk with you?
I could use the exercise.

11:23.050 --> 11:24.150
Be back by dinner.

11:44.130 --> 11:46.140
Here we go. Male, 37,

11:46.160 --> 11:49.180
award-winning investigative reporter.

11:49.200 --> 11:52.180
In the middle of a divorce.
Lives by himself.

11:52.200 --> 11:54.120
The two of you
have so much in common.

11:56.130 --> 11:58.110
Burner phone.

11:58.130 --> 12:01.070
Send him an anonymous text
from someone who has information

12:01.090 --> 12:02.120
about the Berserkers,

12:02.140 --> 12:04.100
who wants to talk to him
but he's scared.

12:05.180 --> 12:07.170
And if he hits you back,
don't reply.

12:07.190 --> 12:09.080
Just ghost his ass.

12:09.100 --> 12:12.110
And what if he doesn't buy it?

12:12.130 --> 12:15.110
Hmm. Burn his house down
with him in it.

12:15.130 --> 12:17.220
I think there's a few more steps
we could take before that.

12:18.000 --> 12:19.210
If you say so.

12:57.040 --> 13:00.100
Until my father
is delivered to us safely,

13:00.120 --> 13:01.230
you get nothin'.

13:02.010 --> 13:05.020
I wonder how your father deals
with men who break agreements.

13:05.040 --> 13:07.160
You can ask him when you find him.

13:07.180 --> 13:11.180
We put our asses at risk twice
trying to save your father.

13:11.200 --> 13:13.160
That deserves something, Ricardo.

13:13.180 --> 13:15.130
I pay for results. Not attempts.

13:15.150 --> 13:18.110
You don't pay for shit.
That's the problem, ain't it?

13:20.090 --> 13:22.160
You need money?

13:22.180 --> 13:25.220
I'll pay you to escort a car
from point A to point B.

13:26.000 --> 13:27.090
Another job.

13:30.180 --> 13:33.080
-How much?
-Fifty thousand.

13:33.100 --> 13:35.070
And I'll pay you in advance.

13:42.000 --> 13:44.060
Now you're talkin' my language.

14:01.040 --> 14:03.040
This guy ain't gonna take the bait.

14:03.060 --> 14:05.160
You'd make a shit fisherman,
you know that?

14:05.180 --> 14:07.120
These kinds of things take time.

14:09.000 --> 14:12.050
But if he doesn't leave his house
in the next couple hours, like I said,

14:12.070 --> 14:13.230
I got gasoline in the trunk.

14:14.010 --> 14:15.130
Of course you do.

14:21.230 --> 14:23.160
There we go. Come on.

14:38.090 --> 14:41.190
Everything's scattered.
How's he keep track of any of this shit?

14:41.210 --> 14:44.150
He probably has a system.
Put everything back where you found it.

14:44.170 --> 14:45.230
Could be on one of these.

14:47.090 --> 14:48.130
Or all of 'em.

14:52.040 --> 14:54.200
Unh-unh. Bad idea.
He'll know.

14:54.220 --> 14:57.230
If he's got any common sense,
it'll scare the shit out of him.

15:04.160 --> 15:05.210
Receipts...

15:08.060 --> 15:09.160
Divorce shit...

15:09.180 --> 15:11.030
This guy's a hoarder.

15:11.050 --> 15:13.220
Rejection letters for
his never-to-be-published novel.

15:14.000 --> 15:15.080
Loser.

15:22.110 --> 15:24.000
I've got something.

15:27.060 --> 15:29.030
Shit.

15:29.050 --> 15:31.140
That fucking bitch.

15:34.140 --> 15:36.040
She's their second informant.

15:36.060 --> 15:39.120
Bitch is sitting in federal lockup
blaming us for ruining her life.

15:39.140 --> 15:41.060
Yeah. And we can't get to her.

15:41.080 --> 15:44.170
If Price talks to the police commission,
we're all screwed.

15:44.190 --> 15:46.200
Kraley's gonna wanna
know about this.

16:34.140 --> 16:36.040
What do you want, Eli?

16:36.060 --> 16:37.190
Revenge.

16:42.230 --> 16:45.040
But I'll settle for restitution.

16:45.060 --> 16:48.160
Listen, what we did
saved your men's lives.

16:48.180 --> 16:52.220
You let them use my family as leverage.
That's out of bounds.

16:53.000 --> 16:54.110
Her choice, not mine.

16:55.160 --> 16:57.080
But let's face it.
Bad shit happens

16:57.100 --> 17:00.120
when you kidnap the godfather
of a drug cartel.

17:03.070 --> 17:05.020
Uhhh!

17:06.080 --> 17:10.070
The Mexicans are asking for answers.

17:10.090 --> 17:13.000
They want to negotiate new terms
for handing over Ignacio.

17:15.080 --> 17:18.000
You got 24 hours to make
this shit right, Hammond.

17:18.020 --> 17:20.070
-Or what?
-Or I'm giving 'em the Ravens.

17:20.090 --> 17:23.050
Ahh!

17:24.090 --> 17:25.180
Am I understood?

17:25.200 --> 17:27.060
That's Kraley's problem--

17:28.040 --> 17:31.070
I  said...  am I understood?

17:31.090 --> 17:32.140
Yeah.

17:33.090 --> 17:34.090
Fuck you!

17:39.230 --> 17:41.070
Let's go.

17:59.220 --> 18:02.030
The Mexicans want
to renegotiate terms.

18:07.150 --> 18:10.030
How do you expect peace
to be mediated?

18:10.050 --> 18:12.070
With a lot of money.

18:15.110 --> 18:17.040
You want your father back,
don't you?

18:17.060 --> 18:19.020
Of course I do.

18:19.040 --> 18:21.020
But my brother
still wants the ports.

18:22.020 --> 18:24.060
He won't get the ports.

18:24.080 --> 18:26.150
Not without starting a war.

18:26.170 --> 18:29.190
Besides, that's the Horseman's territory,
and they don't like you.

18:34.140 --> 18:36.040
You're scared of them.

18:37.020 --> 18:39.210
Carmen, I got enough enemies.

18:39.230 --> 18:41.230
I don't need any more.

18:42.190 --> 18:47.020
Well, we'll reach out
and talk terms with the Mexicans.

18:47.040 --> 18:49.100
-Do that.
-Think about this:

18:49.120 --> 18:52.230
your enemies don't cease to exist
because you give them what they want.

19:05.210 --> 19:07.170
- Yeah?
- I'm calling a summit.

19:07.190 --> 19:10.030
Text everyone and tell them
to be there tonight.

19:10.050 --> 19:11.150
Why, is there something
I should know about?

19:11.170 --> 19:12.200
We can't weather the heat

19:12.220 --> 19:15.190
from the commission and the press
unless we're all on the same page.

19:15.210 --> 19:17.070
If the clubs stay divided,

19:17.090 --> 19:19.010
they'll just pick us off one by one.

19:19.030 --> 19:20.090
You run this by Kraley?

19:20.110 --> 19:22.080
Just do what I ask.

19:22.100 --> 19:24.190
Look, I'll make the calls.
I just don't think

19:24.210 --> 19:26.170
there's a chance in hell that the clubs
are gonna listen to reason.

19:26.190 --> 19:29.020
At least not from us.

19:29.040 --> 19:30.050
Get in.

19:31.190 --> 19:33.060
It's about Veronica.

19:34.160 --> 19:36.050
Shit.

19:53.000 --> 19:54.060
Yeah.

20:06.190 --> 20:08.090
Thanks for letting me see him.

20:10.010 --> 20:12.090
If it's important to you,
it's important to us.

20:12.110 --> 20:14.000
That's what makes social outreach work.

20:14.020 --> 20:16.210
-Is this really about outreach?
-This isn't about Amber.

20:16.230 --> 20:18.060
Then why are you doing it?

20:18.080 --> 20:20.160
Because we care
about people like you.

20:20.180 --> 20:23.040
And that kid in there.
That's why.

20:23.060 --> 20:25.060
"That kid"?

20:25.080 --> 20:28.000
You don't even know his name.

20:28.020 --> 20:32.060
Game recognizes game, son,
and I'm not interesting in playing yours.

20:32.080 --> 20:34.120
Hey, wait a second.

20:34.140 --> 20:37.160
Look, what do I have to do
to prove to you

20:37.180 --> 20:41.000
that we're serious about working
with the community?

20:44.190 --> 20:46.110
Let's take a ride.

21:10.040 --> 21:12.020
You're too young to know this,

21:12.040 --> 21:15.050
but there was a time
you couldn't even walk down this street.

21:18.060 --> 21:20.070
-'Sup, Rev?
-What's up?

21:20.090 --> 21:22.030
-You good? You all right?
-Yeah, man.

21:22.050 --> 21:24.150
Got no complaints, man. I'm good.
Yes, indeed--

21:28.120 --> 21:29.190
You two know each other.

21:29.210 --> 21:32.210
Yeah, he runs half the corners
in our area.

21:40.120 --> 21:41.230
Clinton.

21:46.000 --> 21:47.040
Cole, man.

21:52.170 --> 21:53.210
A'ight, Rev.

22:07.110 --> 22:09.200
You know what we called this street
when I was a kid?

22:10.230 --> 22:12.090
The Crypt.

22:13.030 --> 22:16.040
Blood's been spilled on it
for the past 30 years.

22:17.100 --> 22:19.080
I lost my brother out here.

22:20.090 --> 22:22.020
I'm sorry to hear that.

22:25.020 --> 22:28.000
Look, that kid that I visited today.

22:29.000 --> 22:32.200
He got chased and dragged down
by two of yours yesterday.

22:32.220 --> 22:35.090
They damn near broke his arms.

22:35.110 --> 22:37.010
His name is Barry.

22:37.030 --> 22:40.170
-Barry had a gun in his backpack.
-For a reason, Cole.

22:40.190 --> 22:43.130
He's got a full-ride scholarship
to State.

22:43.150 --> 22:45.090
He just wants to live long enough
to use it.

22:45.110 --> 22:48.020
-You just can't carry no gun.
-Why not? You do.

22:49.000 --> 22:50.150
-Because I'm out here protecting--
-I got it.

22:50.170 --> 22:52.210
I know he made a bad decision, man.

22:54.040 --> 22:56.190
But if he gets a record,
he's gonna lose that scholarship.

23:00.150 --> 23:02.110
All right, I'm gonna look into it.

23:03.120 --> 23:07.040
I'm gonna do that.
But I'm gonna expect something for it.

23:08.140 --> 23:10.070
Of course you would.

23:13.000 --> 23:14.020
You get him out

23:14.040 --> 23:17.030
and I'll see that people start
to look at your friends

23:17.050 --> 23:19.230
in a more... Christian way.

23:29.090 --> 23:31.010
So you're good with it.

23:31.200 --> 23:33.170
-Yeah.
-Yeah?

23:33.190 --> 23:34.230
Are you OK?

23:36.010 --> 23:39.140
-Honey, everything's gonna be fine.
-Thanks, Dad.

23:41.170 --> 23:44.100
You didn't have to send this  pendejo
after me. You coulda just called.

23:44.120 --> 23:46.020
Saves time.

23:46.040 --> 23:48.000
- Where's my daughter?
- She's fine.

23:48.020 --> 23:50.210
I wasn't asking you.
Where's my daughter?

23:58.040 --> 23:59.060
What's this?

23:59.080 --> 24:02.040
We're petitioning sole custody
of Veronica.

24:02.060 --> 24:04.110
With no visitation rights.

24:07.000 --> 24:08.220
And...

24:09.180 --> 24:11.180
we'll win.

24:18.060 --> 24:19.110
We'll counter.

24:19.130 --> 24:21.060
Oh, Pete.

24:25.030 --> 24:26.220
Just sign it.

24:27.000 --> 24:30.200
If you do, you can continue
to have supervised visits.

24:30.220 --> 24:33.080
If you don't...

24:33.100 --> 24:35.220
we'll destroy you.

24:39.050 --> 24:41.170
Pete!

24:41.190 --> 24:43.030
- Get off me!
- You OK?

24:43.050 --> 24:44.170
That's all right. I'm fine.

24:44.190 --> 24:46.060
Stop!

24:46.080 --> 24:47.150
Daddy!

24:47.170 --> 24:50.110
-Dad!
-Stop!

24:50.130 --> 24:53.120
It's OK. It's OK. It's OK.

24:53.140 --> 24:55.080
It's OK. It's OK.

24:55.100 --> 24:57.140
I'm so sorry you had to see that.

24:57.160 --> 24:59.110
Dad...

25:01.100 --> 25:03.120
Just go.

25:03.140 --> 25:07.040
Don't make this worse for yourself.
Or her.

25:10.130 --> 25:12.160
Dad!

25:17.210 --> 25:19.120
- Veronica--
- No!

25:19.140 --> 25:22.210
-Dad! Dad!
-It's OK. It's OK.

25:22.230 --> 25:26.230
No matter what, I'm your father. OK?

25:27.010 --> 25:29.060
I'm your father...

25:29.210 --> 25:32.160
Princesa.

25:32.180 --> 25:35.180
All right?

25:35.200 --> 25:37.090
It's OK. It's OK.

25:37.110 --> 25:39.170
It's fine...

25:49.110 --> 25:52.090
What do you think's
inside those boxes?

25:52.110 --> 25:54.020
Dope.

25:54.160 --> 25:56.200
No.

25:56.220 --> 25:59.100
This was from Carmen's
side of the business.

26:01.020 --> 26:02.230
Do you think it's money?

26:07.130 --> 26:10.220
None of our business
either way, right?

26:36.000 --> 26:37.220
Whatever happens here today,

26:38.000 --> 26:40.210
me and you, we still
got unfinished business.

27:14.040 --> 27:15.150
Get the hell out!

27:19.070 --> 27:20.210
Por favor.

27:50.130 --> 27:52.100
So is the problem resolved?

27:52.120 --> 27:54.220
In theory.

27:58.140 --> 28:00.100
You're not confident?

28:01.020 --> 28:02.160
Not as much as I'd like to be.

28:07.090 --> 28:11.090
The second they hand your father back,
we're expecting payment.

28:11.110 --> 28:12.210
I'm paying a ransom.

28:12.230 --> 28:17.050
So you, and the Ravens,
have nothing to do with that.

28:17.070 --> 28:18.140
He was in jail. We broke him out--

28:18.160 --> 28:19.200
-Kraley.
-Not you.

28:19.220 --> 28:21.110
Kraley!

28:31.050 --> 28:33.040
So there are two issues.

28:33.060 --> 28:36.170
The first being,
you sent Lourdes and Veronica away.

28:36.190 --> 28:39.060
Yeah. I was workin' a case.
It was for their own safety.

28:39.080 --> 28:41.130
That's not the picture your wife painted
in her statement.

28:41.150 --> 28:44.190
Listen, I'm a good father,
all right?

28:44.210 --> 28:48.030
I help my daughter with her homework,
we play chess together...

28:48.050 --> 28:50.020
I read to her before she goes to bed.

28:50.040 --> 28:52.130
None of that changes the allegations
your wife is making.

28:52.150 --> 28:54.040
I thought you were supposed
to be on my side.

28:54.060 --> 28:57.010
I'm trying to prepare you for the type
of treatment you should expect

28:57.030 --> 28:58.050
at the hearing.

29:04.100 --> 29:05.190
OK.

29:05.210 --> 29:07.120
What's the second issue?

29:10.000 --> 29:12.130
Cop gangs.
Your wife says you're a member.

29:12.150 --> 29:14.110
And based on the article I read,

29:14.130 --> 29:17.050
that could be a problem
in the eyes of the court.

29:17.070 --> 29:21.010
It's not a gang. We're a social club.

29:21.030 --> 29:23.180
You know cops hang out
with other cops, right?

29:23.200 --> 29:27.090
You know, swap war stories. Unwind.

29:27.110 --> 29:30.090
It was a pretty damning article.
And I hear there's more to come.

29:31.110 --> 29:33.040
I'll explain when I'm in front
of the judge.

29:33.060 --> 29:36.220
Mr. Ramos, you'll be lucky
if you don't end up in prison.

29:38.150 --> 29:40.200
I'll need at least 30,000
as a retainer

29:40.220 --> 29:42.070
if you want to make this a fair fight.

29:42.090 --> 29:44.030
I don't have that kind of money
right now!

29:44.050 --> 29:46.110
Then I'm not interesting in the case.

29:46.130 --> 29:50.010
Without money to bring on
other resources, I can't win.

30:17.210 --> 30:19.180
Who are you?

30:23.230 --> 30:26.010
Who killed my grandson?

30:30.060 --> 30:33.000
Reach for the gun
and your little sister is dead.

30:33.020 --> 30:35.010
Please don't.

30:35.030 --> 30:36.180
Answer my question.

30:36.200 --> 30:38.060
I don't know
what you're talking about.

30:39.210 --> 30:41.010
Who?

30:44.060 --> 30:46.000
Hammond.

30:47.010 --> 30:49.050
It was Steve Hammond.

31:07.140 --> 31:09.140
Shit.

31:09.160 --> 31:11.000
About damn time.

31:11.020 --> 31:12.100
Where's Kraley?

31:12.120 --> 31:13.210
Isn't he in charge now?

31:13.230 --> 31:15.140
He's got me running point on this.

31:15.160 --> 31:18.050
Can we just get this over with?

31:18.070 --> 31:20.130
The article.

31:20.150 --> 31:22.160
It's just the beginning.

31:22.180 --> 31:25.100
We all know this is gonna end badly
if we don't do something.

31:25.120 --> 31:26.210
This ain't the first time
we've had heat.

31:26.230 --> 31:28.220
The Department will do
some damage control,

31:29.000 --> 31:31.140
and within a week,
back to business.

31:35.010 --> 31:36.100
That's their snitch.

31:36.120 --> 31:39.030
We all know the bitch
has dirt on all of us.

31:42.000 --> 31:43.210
Those are just a few
of the surveillance photos

31:43.230 --> 31:46.020
this reporter had in his possession.

31:46.040 --> 31:48.110
- Shit!
- You got our attention.

31:48.130 --> 31:51.040
-What's the pitch?
-Two things.

31:51.060 --> 31:54.060
We all got people in our clubs
who've been moved to other assignments--

31:54.080 --> 31:55.230
some of them valuable.

31:56.010 --> 31:59.040
Reach out to 'em. Get their help
in quashing this thing.

31:59.060 --> 32:01.000
Why don't we just
take out the reporter?

32:01.020 --> 32:03.010
Yeah, that's a brilliant move.
Foster, teach your bitch

32:03.030 --> 32:04.070
to think without moving his lips.

32:04.090 --> 32:06.020
All right, come on.

32:06.040 --> 32:08.190
-What else?
-We lay low. We stop earnin'

32:08.210 --> 32:10.200
and we start some
community outreach.

32:10.220 --> 32:13.160
-Vipers ain't goin' for that.
-You talkin' for your club now?

32:13.180 --> 32:15.190
No. He is not.

32:15.210 --> 32:18.030
But if we aren't earning,
what is the goddamn point?

32:18.050 --> 32:20.030
Yeah, Hammond. We got needs.

32:20.050 --> 32:23.160
I'm not in these photos,
so this isn't my club's problem.

32:23.180 --> 32:25.220
Do you think this ends
with the Ravens?

32:26.000 --> 32:29.180
Every single one of you idiots
are in this as deep as we are!

32:32.120 --> 32:35.060
You do what you want
with your own little social club, Hammond.

32:35.080 --> 32:37.110
I got a business to run.

32:47.080 --> 32:49.090
- You comin'?
- In a sec.

32:54.020 --> 32:56.230
I got a bone I can throw you.

32:57.010 --> 32:58.050
What?

32:58.070 --> 33:00.190
- A face-to-face with Price.
- How?

33:00.210 --> 33:02.150
She's in federal lockup.
I already tried.

33:02.170 --> 33:04.010
Not anymore she's not.

33:04.030 --> 33:05.200
She's been subpoenaed
by a defense lawyer

33:05.220 --> 33:07.220
to testify on a WMD case.

33:13.230 --> 33:15.210
Yeah?

33:15.230 --> 33:17.090
You alone?

33:19.030 --> 33:22.040
Yeah. What the hell you want,
Kraley?

33:22.060 --> 33:23.130
To meet and talk.

33:23.150 --> 33:26.210
-About what?
- A payday.

33:29.040 --> 33:32.010
I know how you do business,
and I'm not interested.

33:32.030 --> 33:34.100
Then you're an idiot.
And I'll find someone who is.

33:38.020 --> 33:39.230
Why can't the Ravens handle it?

33:56.060 --> 33:58.000
What's up? I got calls stackin' up.

33:58.020 --> 33:59.220
Let me run a scenario by you.

34:00.000 --> 34:03.190
What if you and I got out of Dodge--
indefinitely?

34:03.210 --> 34:06.230
Out of this shit city,
somewhere in the country.

34:09.060 --> 34:10.160
I hate the country.

34:10.180 --> 34:13.200
The tropics. Caribbean. Whatever.
Doesn't matter.

34:13.220 --> 34:16.160
If I had a way to make that happen,
would you come with me?

34:16.180 --> 34:18.130
I gotta handle these calls.

34:19.170 --> 34:21.110
You didn't say no.

35:12.130 --> 35:14.030
-Stay out of trouble now.
-Will do.

35:14.050 --> 35:15.100
See your granddad.

35:24.120 --> 35:25.200
Cole, thank you.

35:25.220 --> 35:27.030
Pastor Greg.

35:29.030 --> 35:30.190
We appreciate it.

35:33.190 --> 35:35.160
Why don't you stay for a bit?

35:37.090 --> 35:39.020
Let's do it.

35:39.040 --> 35:40.170
I should go.

35:40.190 --> 35:43.060
Oh, no, you don't.
You want to make a difference,

35:43.080 --> 35:45.100
it starts with relationships.

35:45.120 --> 35:47.030
Come on.

35:47.190 --> 35:49.150
Come on, man.

35:53.020 --> 35:54.190
Hustle, hustle, hustle!

36:12.020 --> 36:13.050
Ramos.

36:13.070 --> 36:14.140
It's Carmen.

36:14.160 --> 36:16.220
I need your help.

36:17.000 --> 36:20.000
We're finished workin' for you.
Your brother saw to that.

36:20.020 --> 36:22.060
The Mexicans never showed up
at the exchange.

36:22.080 --> 36:24.070
My father's still gone.

36:27.040 --> 36:28.090
Please.

36:57.100 --> 37:00.080
Hey! Look who's back.

37:00.100 --> 37:03.000
This doesn't mean
we lose Meadow, right?

37:03.020 --> 37:04.200
She was always temporary, dickhead.

37:04.220 --> 37:07.120
We'll see about that.
Maybe we'll put it to the vote.

37:10.180 --> 37:12.230
It's good to see you back on your feet.

37:13.010 --> 37:14.190
Seriously.

37:14.210 --> 37:15.230
Thanks, man.

37:20.080 --> 37:22.230
Anybody need a round?
No wait on this side.

37:23.190 --> 37:25.140
How ya feelin'?

37:25.160 --> 37:29.050
Like I got a booty call from life
and it wants to keep screwin' me.

37:34.230 --> 37:36.080
What's up with you?

37:43.010 --> 37:44.190
You ever think about
just leaving this life?

37:44.210 --> 37:47.220
I took three Vicodin on an empty stomach
just to get back to it.

37:48.000 --> 37:50.080
So the answer's no.

37:55.160 --> 38:00.010
Things are never as bad,
or good, as we think they are.

38:00.030 --> 38:01.120
Yeah.

38:06.010 --> 38:07.150
I'm not used to this.

38:08.220 --> 38:10.100
What?

38:10.120 --> 38:13.210
I've just never seen you
unsure about anything.

38:16.170 --> 38:18.070
Just give me a beer.

38:19.190 --> 38:22.160
That I'm used to.
Where's everyone else?

38:22.180 --> 38:24.130
Uh, Steve and Cole are in the back,

38:24.150 --> 38:27.220
Ramon split earlier, saying he had
to do something for his daughter.

39:10.030 --> 39:11.170
Another?

39:14.130 --> 39:17.140
Hey. Can I ask you something?

39:21.150 --> 39:25.020
Say you had a date with a guy
and he didn't show.

39:25.040 --> 39:29.160
He couldn't help it,
and you find that out later.

39:29.180 --> 39:31.080
Would you still be mad?

39:31.100 --> 39:33.170
Or mad enough to get even?

39:34.180 --> 39:36.140
How late is she?

39:36.160 --> 39:41.000
She was supposed to call an hour ago
to pick the dinner spot.

39:41.020 --> 39:44.050
Traffic. Or hit by a bus.

39:44.070 --> 39:46.070
Car won't start.

39:46.090 --> 39:48.060
Or she's getting you back.

40:17.130 --> 40:19.120
How's the patient?

40:20.080 --> 40:22.020
On the mend.

40:23.220 --> 40:27.170
Well, thanks for letting me know
that you had an emergency.

40:31.110 --> 40:32.130
Could we?

40:33.190 --> 40:35.200
Hmm?

40:35.220 --> 40:38.020
-Come on.
-OK.

40:39.030 --> 40:41.100
This is very cute.

40:56.020 --> 40:59.110
You pulled the trigger...

40:59.130 --> 41:01.040
didn't you?

41:02.000 --> 41:04.050
You killed him.

41:04.070 --> 41:06.070
Say it!

41:07.080 --> 41:10.220
Why?
I'm dead either way, right?

41:42.070 --> 41:44.140
Your men just tried to kill me.

41:44.160 --> 41:46.170
I don't know anything about this.

41:46.190 --> 41:48.140
I give you my word.

41:48.160 --> 41:50.100
They wouldn't try this shit
without approval.

41:50.120 --> 41:52.050
They acted on their own accord.

41:52.070 --> 41:53.170
I'll fix it.

41:55.070 --> 41:57.070
But first...

41:57.090 --> 42:00.010
we're gonna need
to talk about other things.

43:34.090 --> 43:36.010
Whatever this is,

43:36.030 --> 43:38.090
it's between us.

43:38.110 --> 43:40.150
Why involve them?

43:40.170 --> 43:42.080
You see...

43:42.100 --> 43:46.050
she says that you're the one
that pulled the trigger.

43:47.150 --> 43:48.200
Not the Mexican.

43:48.220 --> 43:51.150
Did you have a gun against her head
when you asked?

43:52.220 --> 43:54.200
People do what you want
if you scare 'em enough.

43:54.220 --> 43:56.130
Hey!

43:56.150 --> 43:58.040
No more games!

43:59.150 --> 44:01.100
No more lies.

44:05.180 --> 44:07.070
He killed my friend.

44:07.090 --> 44:09.060
A  federale.

44:09.190 --> 44:11.120
A Raven.

44:12.120 --> 44:13.220
So we're even.

44:22.120 --> 44:23.210
Blood for blood.

44:25.160 --> 44:27.180
That's your code, right?

44:29.220 --> 44:31.130
Right?

44:32.030 --> 44:33.110
Yes.

44:41.080 --> 44:43.070
-No, please.
-No!

44:51.010 --> 44:52.050
Lucky, huh?

44:53.000 --> 44:54.200
Calm down.

44:54.220 --> 44:56.100
Lucky for you,

44:56.120 --> 44:58.170
you're more valuable
to me than they are.

45:00.160 --> 45:02.030
No, no!

45:02.050 --> 45:04.030
What are you doing?

45:05.100 --> 45:06.150
Don't let him do it.

45:06.170 --> 45:09.180
I need you. I don't need them.

45:09.200 --> 45:12.120
Easy. Easy now.

45:12.140 --> 45:15.100
Please don't. Please don't...
