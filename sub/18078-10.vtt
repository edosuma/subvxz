I couldn't have made it

05:04.830 --> 05:06.123
Thanks again.

05:06.289 --> 05:08.792
Everybody, Woody and I have
an important announcement.

05:08.875 --> 05:10.544
All proceeds from <i>Let it go</i>...

05:10.669 --> 05:12.421
as well as Saturday's gig
at the Forum...

05:12.546 --> 05:14.881
are headed to the
Third World Relief Fund.

05:18.593 --> 05:21.179
- Saturday night's gig really scares me.
- Why?

05:21.304 --> 05:23.348
Because another threat was
phoned in to the office today.

05:23.473 --> 05:25.559
They don't want that money
going into Central Africa.

05:25.684 --> 05:27.686
Look, I told you,
I'm already into that.

05:27.769 --> 05:30.647
And the A-Team? Some revolutionary
is trying to sell you...

05:30.730 --> 05:33.150
a one-way ticket
to rock 'n' roll heaven...

05:33.275 --> 05:35.152
and all the A-Team
has done is sent you...

05:35.235 --> 05:38.613
on a mini-tour of laundries
and used-car lots.

05:39.114 --> 05:40.866
Maybe these guys
aren't worth the bread.

05:40.991 --> 05:42.701
<i>Back o“ Americanas!</i>

05:43.493 --> 05:46.079
There will be no aid
for those in Southern Trianna!

05:46.204 --> 05:47.581
Is that clear?

05:52.919 --> 05:54.296
Give me the tape.

06:04.431 --> 06:05.849
C'mon, we go!

06:14.483 --> 06:16.234
All right, Murdock,
he's headed your way.

06:16.401 --> 06:20.113
B.A., they're coming at you. You're
our last line of defense, big guy.

06:43.553 --> 06:46.139
Hey! Get that thing
out of the way!

06:58.276 --> 07:00.654
Always wanted to play the piano.

07:13.625 --> 07:14.876
You guys are working for us.

07:14.960 --> 07:16.545
Why didn't you
let us know you were here?

07:16.586 --> 07:18.463
Because the fewer people that
know we are here, the better.

07:18.547 --> 07:19.839
Well, you did save her.
I'll give you that.

07:19.923 --> 07:21.883
But it might have been nice
if you caught those gorillas.

07:21.967 --> 07:24.302
Mr. Stone, your place
is like Grand Central Station.

07:24.427 --> 07:26.555
There are too many people
for even adequate security.

07:26.680 --> 07:27.847
A change of scenery, Colonel?

07:27.931 --> 07:29.307
Yeah,
I think that might be nice.

07:29.432 --> 07:31.393
Miss Faith,
I suggest you come with us.

07:31.518 --> 07:35.188
We'll take you someplace that no one
will even think of looking for you.

07:35.272 --> 07:38.066
We'll take you on a left turn right
out of the fast lane, honey.

07:38.191 --> 07:40.360
Hey, hey, wait a second,
nobody's going anywhere.

07:40.485 --> 07:42.654
Woody, I wanna hear
what they have to say.

07:42.779 --> 07:43.905
Apparently...

07:44.114 --> 07:46.157
these guys
from Northern Trianna...

07:46.241 --> 07:49.160
are dead-set against your
doing any concert or album...

07:49.244 --> 07:51.830
that benefits their starving
enemies in Southern Trianna.

07:51.913 --> 07:53.832
We can guarantee your safety
for 48 hours...

07:53.915 --> 07:56.418
and get you to your gig on time.

07:56.501 --> 07:59.045
Stevi, they were right here, they
couldn't catch those creeps.

07:59.129 --> 08:01.590
Hey, man, next time there won't
be no pianos in the way.

08:02.882 --> 08:04.676
I have a good feeling
about the A-Team.

08:04.759 --> 08:06.761
Their karma's coming
from the right place.

08:06.886 --> 08:08.096
But you understand
you're splitting...

08:08.179 --> 08:10.015
with the hottest voice
in rock 'n' roll.

08:10.098 --> 08:11.099
If anything happens to her--

08:11.182 --> 08:13.268
Your asset's in very good hands.

08:14.311 --> 08:15.312
All right.

08:15.437 --> 08:17.522
Oh, and I wanna take
the master with me.

08:17.647 --> 08:19.858
Come on, you know the master
never leaves the office.

08:19.941 --> 08:22.402
Hey, it almost left
with those guys.

08:22.527 --> 08:24.070
If the A-Team's
gonna protect me...

08:24.154 --> 08:25.697
they can protect
the new album as well.

08:25.780 --> 08:27.157
The lady wants her tape.

08:30.952 --> 08:32.287
We'll be in touch.

08:33.871 --> 08:35.539
Such a pleasure meeting you.

08:35.624 --> 08:36.832
Let's do lunch.

08:38.876 --> 08:40.211
You got a plan, Hannibal?

08:40.378 --> 08:42.255
All we have to
do is stash Miss Faith...

08:42.380 --> 08:43.673
until after the concert...

08:43.756 --> 08:45.925
and then the Triannians have
no reason to come after her.

08:46.009 --> 08:49.137
I can see it now, a quiet
secluded cabin by the lake...

08:49.262 --> 08:50.722
fireplace, the two of us.

08:50.847 --> 08:52.849
You know,
with the right haircut...

08:52.974 --> 08:54.768
we could move you
out of AA ball.

08:54.851 --> 08:56.853
Hannibal, just where
do you propose stashing...

08:56.978 --> 08:59.189
the most recognizable
face in rock 'n' roll?

08:59.314 --> 09:01.900
We need a place with no people.
Defensible. Desolate.

09:01.983 --> 09:03.693
A place one way in.

09:04.277 --> 09:05.570
Face...

09:05.945 --> 09:08.114
I'll tell you exactly
what we need.

09:12.535 --> 09:15.330
Ladies and
gentleman, our new home.

09:24.964 --> 09:26.174
I love it!

09:26.299 --> 09:28.218
It's what I always dreamed of.

09:28.343 --> 09:30.512
Colonel,
we could be so happy here.

09:33.723 --> 09:35.016
Hello, how are you doing?

09:35.100 --> 09:37.102
- Hello Mr. Peck.
- Hi.

09:37.310 --> 09:39.270
- Well, here are the keys.
- Thank you.

09:39.354 --> 09:42.565
And let me say, you have
made a very wise investment.

09:42.774 --> 09:45.402
This house is in genuine
tip-top condition.

09:45.485 --> 09:47.445
You'll find this
a lovely neighborhood.

09:47.570 --> 09:50.115
That's what we're looking for,
peace and quiet.

09:55.495 --> 09:57.664
I see you've rented that other
place we were looking at.

09:57.747 --> 10:00.500
Yes. I do hope that works out.

10:00.583 --> 10:02.127
They don't look
like the kind of people

10:02.210 --> 10:05.213
who can afford
such a gracious contemporary.

10:05.296 --> 10:07.882
That's exactly what I thought.

10:07.966 --> 10:10.009
But they paid
six months' in advance.

10:10.093 --> 10:12.345
I like nice quiet neighbors!

10:12.554 --> 10:14.472
I'm sure it'll all work out.

10:15.223 --> 10:16.766
Look at those guys.

10:27.068 --> 10:30.196
Yes, my mother came
to see the house.

10:30.363 --> 10:32.741
Give her seal of approval,
you know how it is.

10:32.907 --> 10:35.785
- How lovely.
- Well, I really must be going.

10:36.161 --> 10:39.539
That's enough music, mom.

10:40.123 --> 10:42.208
You know
what it does to your heart.

10:42.333 --> 10:44.919
Rock is here to stay, son.

10:46.629 --> 10:48.590
Well, enjoy your new home.

10:48.798 --> 10:49.924
Enjoy.

10:52.552 --> 10:56.473
Don't hurt my dog, mister.
Please, no.

10:58.516 --> 11:00.977
Take it easy, B.A.
It's taken care of.

11:01.060 --> 11:04.481
Daddy, he was trying
to hurt my dog.

11:04.731 --> 11:07.192
I ain't too crazy about
this neighborhood, Hannibal.

11:08.568 --> 11:10.820
Good fences make good neighbors.

11:19.621 --> 11:22.290
Colonel, can we afford this?

11:22.415 --> 11:25.335
I mean, it's so much, so soon.

11:25.543 --> 11:28.213
Well, I was going to rent it,
Hannibal...

11:28.338 --> 11:31.549
and then I realized I could buy
the place for only $10,000 down.

11:31.674 --> 11:35.762
So, I got a variable mortgage starting
at 10 and a quarter percent...

11:35.845 --> 11:37.263
amortized over 30 years...

11:37.347 --> 11:40.391
so I don't think the payments
should squeeze us too much.

11:40.767 --> 11:41.893
Oh, and B.A...

11:42.018 --> 11:44.938
there's no back alley access.

11:45.021 --> 11:48.066
And the second story windows
should make excellent gun turrets.

11:48.191 --> 11:51.069
Face, I think this house
has enormous potential.

11:51.277 --> 11:54.155
I mean, I would just love
to knock out this wall...

11:54.239 --> 11:55.406
and expand the living room.

11:55.490 --> 11:57.325
Yeah, a little paint
here and there...

11:57.450 --> 11:59.369
you know, some landscape work
in the backyard...

11:59.452 --> 12:02.664
I think we could up the resale value
of this place $5,000-$6,000.

12:02.789 --> 12:04.958
B.A., the backyard
is fenced in...

12:05.041 --> 12:07.252
so it could be mined,
if necessary.

12:07.710 --> 12:10.421
This truly is a dream house.

12:11.422 --> 12:13.424
No running in this house,
young lady.

12:14.092 --> 12:15.510
What time do I have to be home?

12:15.593 --> 12:18.388
Do I get my own stereo?
And which bedroom is mine?

12:18.596 --> 12:19.806
There are only three bedrooms.

12:19.931 --> 12:21.850
So, the Colonel and I,
we'll bunk in the master.

12:22.433 --> 12:24.310
Stevi gets her own room,
of course.

12:24.435 --> 12:26.187
The middle one, there's
only one exterior wall.

12:26.312 --> 12:29.274
And that leaves
Murdock and B.A. as roomies.

12:29.357 --> 12:31.693
Man, I want to share no room
with this crazy fool.

12:31.776 --> 12:33.653
Oh, come on, big guy,
we'll have a great time.

12:33.736 --> 12:35.321
We can read under the covers
late at night...

12:35.405 --> 12:37.448
and just scoot out
the window after curfew.

12:37.574 --> 12:39.242
I'm gonna throw you
out the window after curfew.

12:39.367 --> 12:40.743
You ain't no quiet roommate.

12:40.827 --> 12:42.453
Be it ever so humble.

13:21.910 --> 13:23.119
He fakes right.

13:23.369 --> 13:25.288
He fakes left,
he backs into the basket.

13:25.413 --> 13:27.123
He backs in.
He's up, he shoots...

13:27.290 --> 13:28.833
he scores!

13:34.213 --> 13:36.007
What the hell
are you looking at?

13:37.216 --> 13:38.468
Huh?

13:45.224 --> 13:47.644
Hey, Face. You've been in
there for half an hour.

13:47.769 --> 13:50.271
You got 10 seconds
before I break down the door.

13:52.815 --> 13:55.318
Perfection takes time.

14:03.117 --> 14:04.160
What time is it?

14:04.243 --> 14:06.522
Oh, well, 8:00 a.m.,
and I must say--

14:06.547 --> 14:07.747
Oh, man!

14:07.872 --> 14:09.415
It's the middle of the night.

14:14.295 --> 14:16.422
<i>It's 8:05
here on a Friday morning...</i>

14:16.506 --> 14:18.883
<i>and those freeways
are a mess, folks.</i>

14:19.008 --> 14:21.052
<i>If you're in a hurry
to get to work, forget it.</i>

14:21.177 --> 14:23.429
<i>You better hope the boss is
sitting in the car next to you...</i>

14:23.513 --> 14:24.973
<i>because you ain't going nowhere.</i>

14:25.056 --> 14:27.183
<i>But we'll be here to keep you
company, right up till noon...</i>

14:27.266 --> 14:30.353
I really don't know what is
with this family anymore.

14:30.478 --> 14:33.314
The four of us just don't seem
to communicate in the morning.

14:34.273 --> 14:37.443
I have six eggs, 12 pieces
of bacon, half a loaf.

14:37.944 --> 14:41.489
Two eggs,
two pieces of bacon, a single.

14:41.781 --> 14:44.784
Three eggs, three pieces
of bacon and a pair...

14:44.867 --> 14:47.662
and we have an intruder
at 2:00, gentlemen.

14:57.463 --> 14:59.048
All right. You wanna
tell us who you are...

14:59.132 --> 15:00.633
and what you are doing
in our backyard?

15:02.427 --> 15:03.553
Joe Skrylow.

15:03.720 --> 15:05.847
18026 Highfield Street.

15:06.097 --> 15:08.099
I'm the head
of the Neighborhood Patrol.

15:08.266 --> 15:09.892
If it was a cup of sugar,
you're after...

15:10.018 --> 15:11.185
you could've used
the front door.

15:11.310 --> 15:12.812
I was on patrol.

15:13.229 --> 15:15.440
I saw this jabrone
in your living room...

15:15.523 --> 15:17.025
casing the TV,
other valuables...

15:17.108 --> 15:18.443
I thought you were being robbed.

15:18.568 --> 15:20.111
So I sprung into action.

15:20.194 --> 15:21.696
Well, I feel safer already.

15:21.821 --> 15:23.406
But just who are you guys?

15:23.573 --> 15:25.700
We're your new neighbors.

15:25.783 --> 15:27.035
All four of you?

15:27.326 --> 15:28.995
So you guys aren't...

15:29.871 --> 15:31.581
He ain't talking about what I
think he's talking about, is he?

15:31.664 --> 15:33.833
We're all recently divorced.

15:34.042 --> 15:36.544
We all decided to live
together to share expenses.

15:36.669 --> 15:37.670
Oh.

15:37.795 --> 15:38.838
It's really nice.

15:38.963 --> 15:40.590
Well,
welcome to Highfield Street.

15:40.673 --> 15:41.841
Thank you.

15:42.050 --> 15:43.092
Hey...

15:43.301 --> 15:46.804
that's a really nice home defense weapon.
You guys in the military?

15:46.888 --> 15:48.014
- Nam.
- Yeah.

15:48.139 --> 15:49.557
Sorry I missed that picnic.

15:49.682 --> 15:52.143
That's a shame. Well...

15:53.436 --> 15:55.396
it's nice meeting you, Joe.

15:57.648 --> 15:59.400
♪♪There
they go again with that stuff.

15:59.484 --> 16:01.694
I don't know what this
neighborhood is coming to.

16:01.903 --> 16:04.781
We're very quiet.
You'll hardly know we're here.

16:05.698 --> 16:08.367
Hey, guys, which outfit do you
dig for the suburban look?

16:08.493 --> 16:11.120
I thought you said
you were four divorced men?

16:11.245 --> 16:14.248
Yeah. This is my daughter
from my first marriage.

16:14.373 --> 16:16.751
Honey, say hello to Joe Skrylow.

16:16.876 --> 16:17.794
What's happening?

16:17.919 --> 16:20.671
What do you say we hit the Iron
Tomato for a little breakfast?

16:20.755 --> 16:21.631
My treat.

16:21.756 --> 16:23.299
You're grounded, young lady,
remember?

16:23.382 --> 16:27.637
Yes. Stevi, why don't we talk
about marrying into the family.

16:27.804 --> 16:29.430
Why don't we
skip the marriage...

16:29.514 --> 16:31.057
and go straight
to the honeymoon?

16:31.182 --> 16:33.768
Kids,
they get wilder and wilder.

16:33.851 --> 16:36.562
Yeah. Sometimes it's hard to imagine
they'll amount to anything.

16:36.771 --> 16:38.439
Well, this has been
a genuine pleasure.

16:38.564 --> 16:40.108
We'll visit again soon.

16:40.483 --> 16:42.193
Hey, wait a minute.

16:42.401 --> 16:44.195
You guys were all
in the military, right?

16:44.403 --> 16:46.489
I got something I want to show you.
You'll love it.

16:46.572 --> 16:47.698
Come with me.

16:49.242 --> 16:51.327
I think it's very important...

16:51.452 --> 16:54.413
to get acquainted with new
neighbors in a new neighborhood.

16:55.498 --> 16:57.125
You got the guard, B.A.

17:05.133 --> 17:06.634
It's my pride and joy.

17:09.345 --> 17:11.513
I plan to be ready
for the Big One.

17:12.140 --> 17:14.058
- You're a survivalist.
- Yep.

17:14.559 --> 17:17.645
I picked this puppy up at a
swap meet, got her for a song.

17:17.770 --> 17:19.313
A Snow Brat in L.A...

17:19.438 --> 17:20.690
now there's a bargain.

17:20.815 --> 17:22.233
It's no longer a Snow Brat.

17:22.316 --> 17:24.944
It's now an urban assault
and escape vehicle.

17:25.528 --> 17:27.280
Complete
with life support systems...

17:27.405 --> 17:29.532
and able
to transverse any terrain.

17:29.699 --> 17:31.951
Ideal for the nuclear winter.

17:32.618 --> 17:34.120
Powdered ice cream.

17:34.245 --> 17:36.747
Does it come
in coffee almond fudge?

17:37.623 --> 17:40.251
No, just chocolate and vanilla.

17:40.459 --> 17:42.044
I've one problem, though.

17:42.628 --> 17:45.298
Can't seem to
get the darn thing started.

17:53.389 --> 17:55.323
No, Mister, no.

17:55.370 --> 17:57.032
Please, don't hurt us.

17:57.268 --> 17:58.769
Daddy.

17:58.895 --> 18:00.855
You wanted a gun?
You got a pistol.

18:04.025 --> 18:05.610
I've had enough of these guys.

18:05.693 --> 18:07.987
I'm going down there to tell them
they got to pack their bags.

18:17.413 --> 18:18.623
Hey, get your own gun.

18:18.706 --> 18:20.750
It's my gun.
It's my gun.

18:27.798 --> 18:29.091
Thank you, mister.

18:29.217 --> 18:30.468
Anytime, sweetheart.

18:31.802 --> 18:33.095
Thank you, mister.

18:33.221 --> 18:36.098
We're your new neighbors
from 18022, down the block.

18:36.224 --> 18:38.351
We'd appreciate it if you'd
show a little consideration...

18:38.476 --> 18:40.394
for the rest of the folks
in this neighborhood.

18:40.561 --> 18:41.562
Who's your girlfriend?

18:41.687 --> 18:43.314
Step down here
and say that, sucker.

18:44.148 --> 18:46.067
Sorry, we're busy.

18:46.817 --> 18:47.985
No.

18:49.528 --> 18:51.113
Everybody back!

19:05.086 --> 19:06.295
B.A.

19:12.134 --> 19:15.012
The next time you lowlifes bother
anybody in this neighborhood...

19:15.096 --> 19:17.014
we'll be back here
to do some real damage.

19:17.431 --> 19:19.725
That was wonderful,
just wonderful.

19:19.809 --> 19:22.228
Now, that's the type of leadership
we need in this neighborhood.

19:22.353 --> 19:23.646
Thanks, it was a pleasure.

19:23.813 --> 19:25.273
As a matter of fact...

19:25.356 --> 19:26.983
you should be Block Captain.

19:27.066 --> 19:28.109
Oh, no.

19:28.609 --> 19:32.363
Pete, I've got nearly 14 months
left before my term expires.

19:32.488 --> 19:34.907
Yes, I think Joe
here is doing a wonderful job.

19:34.991 --> 19:36.200
A wonderful job.

19:36.284 --> 19:38.494
Well, I think it's time
for a change.

19:38.744 --> 19:40.121
All those in favor?

19:40.288 --> 19:41.205
Yeah.

19:41.289 --> 19:42.498
- Opposed?
- Nay.

19:42.623 --> 19:43.332
Nay.

19:43.457 --> 19:45.001
Then I hereby declare...

19:45.167 --> 19:46.085
Hannibal Smith.

19:46.210 --> 19:48.671
Highfield Block Captain and head
of the Neighborhood Patrol.

19:48.796 --> 19:49.880
Congratulations.

19:52.800 --> 19:53.843
Thanks.

20:24.915 --> 20:26.584
Mr. Juarez...

20:28.836 --> 20:30.296
what are you doing here?

20:30.755 --> 20:32.381
What the hell
happened to you two?

20:32.465 --> 20:34.383
We got beat up
by the Block Captain.

20:34.592 --> 20:37.053
I put you in a nice quiet
neighborhood for two days...

20:37.136 --> 20:40.181
to wait for a shipment and you get
taken out by some guy walking his dog?

20:40.264 --> 20:41.349
No, there was four guys.

20:41.432 --> 20:42.391
What did they do?

20:42.516 --> 20:44.018
Stop on their way
to their golf game?

20:44.101 --> 20:46.020
No, these guys,
they weren't regular guys.

20:46.103 --> 20:47.855
I don't wanna hear it.
All you had to do...

20:47.980 --> 20:50.107
was sit tight till we get
the shipment off the plane.

20:50.191 --> 20:51.317
Was that too much to ask?

20:51.442 --> 20:52.485
We were stuck here...

20:52.651 --> 20:54.570
and we couldn't make the pick-up...
- Yeah, he's right.

20:54.653 --> 20:55.738
...until today.
- You're lucky...

20:55.863 --> 20:58.240
I'm letting you live
to make the pick-up.

20:59.658 --> 21:01.786
We're not gonna let
some bowling team...

21:01.869 --> 21:04.246
get in the way
of two million in powder, huh?

21:04.455 --> 21:05.998
- No, sir.
- No.

21:20.221 --> 21:23.349
Hey, is this stuff
happening, or what?

21:23.474 --> 21:24.558
This stuff is junk.

21:24.683 --> 21:26.602
Really, Hannibal, badges?

21:26.769 --> 21:28.896
Badges? We don't need
no stinking badges.

21:28.979 --> 21:30.231
We're supposed to be laying low.

21:30.356 --> 21:31.982
Now we're
the center of attention.

21:32.274 --> 21:33.776
We can use this patrol.

21:34.110 --> 21:35.361
While we are out
doing our rounds...

21:35.444 --> 21:38.030
we keep our eye out
for anybody who's after Stevi.

21:38.114 --> 21:41.200
Yeah, keeps the neighborhood
free of terrorists.

21:41.283 --> 21:42.493
Maybe catch a burglar.

21:42.576 --> 21:43.828
I don't like it, Hannibal.

21:43.911 --> 21:45.871
Is this another one of your
piece of cake jobs...

21:45.955 --> 21:47.623
that's supposed
to go down 1, 2, 3?

21:47.706 --> 21:50.501
But remember, there's always
4, 5, and 6.

21:50.584 --> 21:53.129
B.A., you're just
gonna have to relax...

21:53.337 --> 21:55.464
and enjoy
the suburban lifestyle.

21:55.548 --> 21:58.259
It reminds me of my life
before Woody discovered me.

21:58.384 --> 21:59.969
How did you hook up
with Stone, anyway?

22:00.094 --> 22:02.596
Well, I was singing
at the Hot Potato in St. Paul.

22:02.721 --> 22:06.267
I was 17 and signed a deal with
Mike Fontenetta, the bartender.

22:06.350 --> 22:08.394
Everybody said
I had a great voice.

22:08.686 --> 22:10.563
Some people offered
to take me on the road...

22:10.688 --> 22:12.273
but Mikey wouldn't
let me leave the Potato.

22:12.398 --> 22:14.024
And then along
came Woody Stone...

22:14.150 --> 22:17.027
and offered to get you out of the
contract with Fontenetta. Right?

22:17.111 --> 22:18.946
Woody used to come in
all the time.

22:19.113 --> 22:21.407
He was looking for a career
change, you know what I mean?

22:21.532 --> 22:23.284
So after he got you
away from Fontenetta...

22:23.367 --> 22:25.244
he signed you to a record deal
and launched your career.

22:25.327 --> 22:26.871
Yep, Woody did it all.

22:26.996 --> 22:28.581
He's like a promotional genius.

22:28.706 --> 22:30.499
I love the music business.

22:30.708 --> 22:32.626
I'm starting to feel
cooped up out here.

22:32.793 --> 22:34.920
Face, what do you say,
we hit the scene tonight?

22:35.129 --> 22:38.465
Stevi, you got to stay out of
sight till after the concert.

22:38.591 --> 22:40.926
Everybody knows
you're a party animal...

22:41.010 --> 22:43.637
and they're just waiting for
you to hit the streets. Now...

22:44.013 --> 22:46.682
it's just about time for me
to call your Mr. Stone.

22:47.016 --> 22:49.226
I am not a party animal.

22:49.560 --> 22:50.811
I'm a party reptile.

22:50.936 --> 22:53.063
And after that
comes party criminal.

22:53.189 --> 22:56.400
And finally, at three in the
morning, zonked out on the couch...

22:56.525 --> 22:58.235
Party vegetable!

22:58.319 --> 22:59.361
Yes!

23:00.738 --> 23:01.780
<i>Woody Stone.</i>

23:01.906 --> 23:02.865
Hannibal Smith.

23:02.940 --> 23:04.241
<i>Just want to let you know
that we're okay.</i>

23:04.366 --> 23:06.076
- Where are you?
- <i>Our location isn't important.</i>

23:06.202 --> 23:08.329
I called to see if you had
any more threats today.

23:08.454 --> 23:10.414
No, not today. Look, Stevi
is very important to me.

23:10.539 --> 23:12.333
I think I should know
where she is.

23:12.458 --> 23:15.502
Sorry, Mr. Stone, that's not
the way we operate.

23:15.961 --> 23:18.797
I assure you she's safe and sound.
Hang on a second.

23:19.006 --> 23:20.633
Here, say hello to Woody.

23:22.051 --> 23:23.886
Not a word about our location.

23:24.887 --> 23:26.096
Yo, Woody!

23:37.566 --> 23:39.360
We'll talk to you
a little later.

23:43.822 --> 23:47.409
Doesn't anybody call before they
go visiting in this neighborhood?

23:51.288 --> 23:53.290
These are the guys
who gave you trouble?

23:53.540 --> 23:54.959
Don't tell me, let me guess.

23:55.084 --> 23:56.585
You're the guy
from down the block...

23:56.669 --> 23:58.963
who paid his rent
six months in advance.

23:59.296 --> 24:01.548
And these boys,
your cub scout troops.

24:01.632 --> 24:04.969
I come down here to tell you to
stay away from me and my house.

24:05.094 --> 24:06.220
I can't do that.

24:06.303 --> 24:08.097
I'm the neighborhood
Block Captain.

24:08.222 --> 24:10.516
It's my job to see
the neighborhood is safe.

24:10.599 --> 24:11.558
And quiet.

24:11.684 --> 24:13.060
Hey, that's Stevi Faith!

24:13.310 --> 24:16.105
I almost saw you at the Forum last
year, but I couldn't get tickets.

24:16.188 --> 24:17.356
Shut up.

24:18.357 --> 24:20.025
I'm doing business here.

24:20.818 --> 24:22.444
I can get pretty nasty.

24:22.569 --> 24:25.447
You know, you haven't tried a
burger till you've tried ours.

24:27.241 --> 24:29.535
Now, what do you say,
we go back to your house...

24:29.660 --> 24:32.121
kick back,
and talk this thing over?

24:32.204 --> 24:35.499
I'll bet you've got enough
dope stashed in there...

24:35.666 --> 24:38.002
to get the entire
neighborhood stoned.

24:38.085 --> 24:40.004
You don't know who
you're dealing with, Jack.

24:40.129 --> 24:41.463
I think I do.

24:42.006 --> 24:43.507
You should think of relocating.

24:43.590 --> 24:44.967
We don't like you.

24:45.050 --> 24:47.219
And we don't want
your pet squirrels...

24:47.303 --> 24:48.846
cluttering up the neighborhood.

24:48.971 --> 24:50.347
We're the Neighborhood Watch...

24:50.472 --> 24:52.141
and we gonna be
watching you move.

24:52.266 --> 24:53.392
Yeah?

24:55.853 --> 24:58.981
Only one of us ends up owning
this neighborhood, my friend.

24:59.982 --> 25:02.693
It's not nice threatening
your Block Captain.

25:15.414 --> 25:16.957
Murdock, you got four darts...

25:17.082 --> 25:19.126
two with beepers, two with mics.

25:19.293 --> 25:20.502
Take your best shot.

25:20.669 --> 25:22.504
You two will stay here
and behave yourselves.

25:22.588 --> 25:23.505
Hannibal.

25:23.630 --> 25:24.631
I will.

25:24.798 --> 25:27.301
I'm going to scout the best route
to get Stevi to the concert.

25:27.384 --> 25:28.510
B.A., you and Murdock...

25:28.635 --> 25:30.596
are gonna take care of our
amigos, if they make a move.

25:30.721 --> 25:32.639
Everything's gotta be
an adventure, huh, Hannibal?

25:32.723 --> 25:34.433
Every road has its potholes.

25:34.516 --> 25:35.809
And we gotta stop and fill them.

25:35.893 --> 25:37.436
A hole is a hole.

25:37.644 --> 25:41.190

takes to fill the Albert Hall ♪

25:41.273 --> 25:43.609

25:50.240 --> 25:51.867
What's going on here?
What happened?

25:51.950 --> 25:53.160
Did I miss something?

25:54.286 --> 25:55.829
Actually,
It's all taken care of.

25:55.913 --> 25:57.373
Taken care of? What do
you mean taken care of?

25:57.456 --> 25:58.999
Those guys looked
pretty peeved to me.

25:59.166 --> 26:03.212
Are you sure you can handle the
responsibilities of being Block Captain?

26:03.379 --> 26:05.589
Well, I'm catching on...

26:05.714 --> 26:08.217
but it'll take me a while
before I'm as good as you are.

26:08.300 --> 26:09.426
And what's with that guy?

26:09.510 --> 26:12.179
What, you're going on patrol
with a dart gun?

26:12.846 --> 26:14.348
Actually he's..

26:14.431 --> 26:17.267
How about if I help him? You know, just
take him around, show him the ropes.

26:17.351 --> 26:18.602
- What do you say?
- I'd appreciate it, neighbor.

26:18.685 --> 26:20.229
- You got a bike?
- Me, me...

26:21.647 --> 26:23.482

Stevi Faith concert...</i>

26:23.565 --> 26:25.025
<i>is now a complete sellout.</i>

26:25.109 --> 26:26.777
See?
See, that's the same chick.

26:27.694 --> 26:29.655
She looks smaller on TV.

26:33.367 --> 26:35.577
Hey, come on,
I was watching that.

26:36.620 --> 26:38.288
It's time to make the move.

26:39.706 --> 26:41.333
You call
when you've got the goods.

26:41.417 --> 26:42.543
<i>Si, senor.</i>

26:42.709 --> 26:44.795
All right.
These are the Smitkowskis.

26:45.003 --> 26:47.464
Two adults, three
children, one canine.

26:47.548 --> 26:49.675
Two adults, three
children, and one canine.

26:49.758 --> 26:52.928
Charlie Petroski. He's got a parakeet.
Usually quiet.

26:53.011 --> 26:54.138
He's away in Palm Springs.

26:54.221 --> 26:55.222
One of those.

26:56.181 --> 26:57.975
I don't know these guys,
they're new.

27:05.983 --> 27:07.234
Oh, yeah?

27:12.614 --> 27:14.074
He made a direct hit.

27:14.241 --> 27:15.534
It was the beeper dart.

27:15.701 --> 27:16.952
I'll see you later.

27:41.477 --> 27:43.479
Looks like they're taking a
left about a mile up the road.

27:43.562 --> 27:44.730
They're headed for the airport.

27:44.855 --> 27:46.690
All right,
you know what to do, big guy.

28:17.054 --> 28:19.473
What we need is
a little distraction.

28:19.848 --> 28:21.517
You got an atomic bomb?

28:22.559 --> 28:24.561
I can't believe you never
heard of Stevi Faith.

28:24.728 --> 28:26.021
What, Colombia, right?

28:26.230 --> 28:27.064
<i>Si.</i>

28:27.189 --> 28:28.774
Man, they've got to have
her records down there.

28:28.857 --> 28:29.942
I mean, I can't believe
you've never heard...

No?

29:38.969 --> 29:40.220
Now, what do you suppose...

29:40.304 --> 29:43.890
is so special about these rotten
crates and these lousy bales here?

29:47.269 --> 29:48.562
What do you know?

29:48.812 --> 29:50.856
Snow in the summertime.

29:51.523 --> 29:52.899
Hold it on them, B.A.

30:00.699 --> 30:04.161
Got a regular department store here.
Let's tie 'em up, B.A.

30:23.805 --> 30:24.931
Another day...

30:26.391 --> 30:27.684
another doper.

30:43.033 --> 30:45.494
See, nothing to it.

30:45.661 --> 30:47.037
Now all we got to do...

30:47.120 --> 30:48.914
is just sit on Stevi
till tomorrow night.

30:49.039 --> 30:50.749
Don't say that, fool.
You're gonna jinx us.

30:50.832 --> 30:54.378
B.A., B.A., it is just
like Stevi said:

30:54.503 --> 30:58.048
sometimes your karma is just
moving in the right direction.

30:58.131 --> 30:59.549
Anyway, ain't no way...

30:59.675 --> 31:01.176
anybody's gonna be able
to locate her.

31:18.068 --> 31:19.903
<i>Have you seen this young lady?</i>

Next door to you?
Yeah.

32:15.709 --> 32:17.794
In Canoga Park.
You're sure it's them?

32:17.878 --> 32:19.254
Absolutely, positively.

32:19.379 --> 32:21.715
I talked to the four clowns
last night.

32:21.882 --> 32:23.341
Bunch of wimps, if you ask me.

32:23.425 --> 32:25.844
Listen, Joe, let's keep this
between me and you.

32:25.927 --> 32:27.711
<i>Let's keep the cops and
the reporters out of it.</i>

32:27.736 --> 32:28.575
Why?

32:28.600 --> 32:30.640
Because I just want
to get Stevi back unharmed.

32:30.766 --> 32:31.975
She's very important to me.

32:32.142 --> 32:34.936
C'mon, you know with SWAT teams
and military fugitives...

32:35.020 --> 32:37.439
Yeah. Right.

32:37.522 --> 32:38.732
Okay, how about this?

32:38.815 --> 32:41.735
How about if I hold them
until you get here?

32:41.818 --> 32:43.403
You bring
the reward money with you.

32:43.528 --> 32:45.197
And cash.

32:45.363 --> 32:46.364
No checks.

32:46.448 --> 32:49.117
Sure, Joe. I think
we speak the same language.

32:50.243 --> 32:51.787
Pack the Hawaiian shirts.

32:51.953 --> 32:54.456
That reward money
is as good as ours.

32:54.664 --> 32:57.667
All my life I wanted
people to recognize me.

32:58.126 --> 33:00.003
To think I was somebody special.

33:00.170 --> 33:01.797
And now that they do...

33:02.297 --> 33:04.382
I just want to be
invisible again.

33:05.050 --> 33:07.302
Ah, yes, the price of fame...

33:07.636 --> 33:09.304
you lose your anonymity.

33:09.930 --> 33:12.390
Fame. What a concept.

33:12.599 --> 33:14.684
I don't know whether it's me
they think is special...

33:14.768 --> 33:17.312
or I'm special
because I'm Stevi Faith.

33:17.521 --> 33:19.272
I think you're special
either way.

33:19.356 --> 33:20.899
I kind of like you.

33:21.066 --> 33:22.359
Even with this haircut?

33:22.442 --> 33:23.985
Even with the haircut.

33:24.152 --> 33:27.364
It's just that sometimes I wish
I could settle down, you know.

33:27.697 --> 33:29.825
Go back
to being Stephanie Frankel.

33:30.075 --> 33:31.952
The girl Woody discovered
in Minnesota?

33:32.077 --> 33:32.869
Yeah.

33:32.994 --> 33:34.746
Ever heard of
a rock star named Frankel?

33:34.830 --> 33:36.414
You could have been the first.

33:37.290 --> 33:39.376
Woody decided I was Stevi Faith.

33:39.459 --> 33:42.420
She's not really a person,
though, she's an image.

33:42.754 --> 33:45.924
A corporation with a bunch of
lawyers and accountants...

33:46.049 --> 33:47.926
agents and managers.

33:48.426 --> 33:51.012
They make you feel
like if you stop singing...

33:51.179 --> 33:53.431
you'll put half of Hollywood
on the unemployment line.

33:53.515 --> 33:54.558
That's exactly it.

33:54.683 --> 33:57.143
Well, around here,
you can be whoever you want.

33:57.394 --> 33:59.855
Including plain old
Stephanie Frankel.

34:00.939 --> 34:02.732
<i>Attention, A-Team.</i>

34:03.066 --> 34:05.193

34:07.195 --> 34:10.072

34:10.197 --> 34:13.659
<i>Come on out,

34:14.619 --> 34:16.871
Hey, Joe, what's going on?

34:16.955 --> 34:18.331
This isn't very neighborly.

34:18.415 --> 34:20.417
Ah, cut the con job.

34:20.500 --> 34:22.210
I know all about you guys.

34:22.377 --> 34:24.754
Now surrender immediately.

34:26.882 --> 34:28.257
What are you gonna do?

34:28.592 --> 34:30.342
Well, we can't start volleying
with this joker.

34:30.427 --> 34:32.512
He'll shoot up
the whole neighborhood.

34:40.145 --> 34:41.730
Okay, Joe, okay, you win.

34:41.813 --> 34:43.648
We're coming right out.

34:45.942 --> 34:47.527
What the heck
are you doing, Joe?

34:47.694 --> 34:49.905
Great. Armed
and dangerous fugitives...

34:49.987 --> 34:51.364
and you make them
Block Captains.

34:51.489 --> 34:52.908
- Look, I'm--
- Wait'll we need a Mayor.

34:52.991 --> 34:55.076
Then we'll call San Quentin
and see who's available.

34:55.201 --> 34:57.203
I'm a pretty good
judge of character, Joe...

34:57.287 --> 34:59.039
and I think you're all wet
about these fellows.

34:59.122 --> 35:01.416
Hey, Joe, you're making
a terrible scene here.

35:01.541 --> 35:03.084
What do you say,
we talk this out, huh?

35:03.168 --> 35:04.711
Not another move, pal.

35:04.794 --> 35:07.505
Oh, please, don't hurt him,
he's my friend!

35:07.631 --> 35:09.257
Look, they brainwashed her.

35:09.341 --> 35:11.134
Just like that Patty Hearst kid.

35:13.011 --> 35:15.430
Joe, come on, put down the gun.

35:16.181 --> 35:17.933
Hey, did you bring my reward?

35:22.771 --> 35:24.439
Move! Inside!

35:39.829 --> 35:40.956
Freeze.

35:41.331 --> 35:42.540
All right.

35:45.585 --> 35:46.753
Bye.

35:58.890 --> 36:01.351
Oh, Woody,
thank goodness you're here.

36:01.601 --> 36:03.645
We cannot find the tape, Stone.

36:04.688 --> 36:07.482
I guess we'll just have to sit and
wait for your friends to come back.

36:23.123 --> 36:24.541
We got trouble, guys.

36:24.666 --> 36:26.960
Stone's behind the whole thing.

36:27.168 --> 36:29.129
He's holding Stevi and Face.

36:29.254 --> 36:30.547
And he's got
those two gorillas...

36:30.630 --> 36:32.590
that attacked the sound
studio to back him up.

36:40.181 --> 36:41.641
Uh, look, Stone...

36:41.766 --> 36:43.727
what do you say we talk
about this over breakfast?

36:43.810 --> 36:44.853
Pass.

36:45.311 --> 36:47.272
Woody, this is a really
evil thing you're doing.

36:47.397 --> 36:50.191
There's a karma shift here that
could spell your cosmic doom.

36:50.358 --> 36:51.943
Yeah. She's got a point.

37:15.216 --> 37:16.634
Where are the tapes, pal?

37:16.718 --> 37:18.762
Uh, what happened to the accent?

37:19.471 --> 37:20.805
Oh, let me guess...

37:20.972 --> 37:23.391
the whole Trianna thing
is just a ruse, right?

37:23.516 --> 37:25.060
To draw suspicion away from you.

37:25.143 --> 37:27.520
Very good.
Go to the head of your class.

37:27.604 --> 37:29.189
Boy, whatever you want,
you just take...

37:29.355 --> 37:32.317
like, Stevi's contract
with the Hot Potato.

37:32.567 --> 37:34.235
Yeah, poor Mike Fontenetta.

37:34.360 --> 37:36.780
Tending bar from a wheelchair.
But that's history.

37:36.863 --> 37:38.156
Woody, how could you?

37:38.281 --> 37:40.241
What did you think,
I was gonna stand by...

37:40.366 --> 37:42.911
while you gave millions
to some people in Trianna?

37:43.036 --> 37:45.330
I'm really disappointed
in you, Woody.

37:45.872 --> 37:47.665
I guess I really never knew you.

37:47.791 --> 37:49.918
I just can't understand
all these bad vibes.

37:50.043 --> 37:52.670
You know, it's like when you're a
kid and you go to the beach...

37:52.796 --> 37:55.340
and you make
this huge sandcastle.

37:55.715 --> 37:57.383
It turns out to be perfect.

37:57.550 --> 37:58.968
Well, then it's time to go home.

37:59.052 --> 38:01.638
So you step all over it so no
other kid can play with it.

38:01.763 --> 38:04.432
I made it.
It was mine to destroy.

38:05.141 --> 38:07.393
I'm gonna do the same thing
to you, Stevi Faith.

38:07.602 --> 38:10.105
Have you ever considered
psychiatric help?

38:11.439 --> 38:13.316
Okay, guys, quietly.

40:07.472 --> 40:09.265
Let's hope it snows.

40:12.352 --> 40:15.855
I told you before,
Hannibal has the tape.

40:17.899 --> 40:19.359
Why doesn't anyone believe me?

40:19.442 --> 40:20.735
He should've been back by now.

40:20.902 --> 40:22.237
Oh, he's at the other house.

40:22.320 --> 40:23.613
The one at the end of the block.

40:23.738 --> 40:24.781
What are you talking about?

40:24.822 --> 40:27.158
Well, we rented two houses,
you know...

40:27.242 --> 40:29.494
I mean, just in case
of attack. Double security.

40:29.577 --> 40:31.746
See, that way we have
both ends of the cul-de-sac--

40:31.829 --> 40:33.581
Smart. Very smart.

40:33.748 --> 40:35.250
Clever little group.

40:35.375 --> 40:36.751
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

40:36.876 --> 40:39.045
Wait a second, that means
he knows we're here.

40:43.091 --> 40:44.592
Okay, pretty boy...

40:44.968 --> 40:46.177
what's the password?

40:46.302 --> 40:48.137
Password?
We don't have a password.

40:48.263 --> 40:49.681
What's the password?

40:49.764 --> 40:51.975
Just knock on the door,
and say...

40:52.308 --> 40:54.644
"It's the new Block Captain."

40:54.727 --> 40:56.396
"It's the new Block Captain."

40:56.479 --> 40:57.814
Yeah. You got it.

41:02.235 --> 41:03.403
What?

41:07.407 --> 41:08.950
Dixon, Minolo...

41:09.075 --> 41:11.869
the boys are all busted and
then we lost the whole load.

41:13.621 --> 41:15.707
- Who did this?
- The Block Captain!

41:15.790 --> 41:17.000
Get the artillery.

41:18.251 --> 41:19.168
Who is it?

41:19.294 --> 41:21.254
It's the new Block Captain.

42:08.968 --> 42:10.928
- How you doing, Face?
- Terrific.

43:23.751 --> 43:26.087
Well, I guess you've
fallen off the charts.

43:26.212 --> 43:28.381
That makes us number one.
With a bullet.

43:29.549 --> 43:30.675
Hey, guys...

43:31.551 --> 43:32.969
guess we took care of them.

43:34.011 --> 43:35.388
Tell you what, Joe.

43:35.555 --> 43:37.598
We'll give you credit
for all the arrests.

43:37.723 --> 43:41.054
That should guarantee you being Block
Captain for the rest of your life.

43:41.079 --> 43:41.968
Yeah?

43:43.437 --> 43:46.232
Well, I deserve it.

44:02.290 --> 44:03.916
So much for your dream house.

44:04.041 --> 44:07.086
Well, maybe we could
sell it as a fixer-upper.

44:11.382 --> 44:14.635
Look, guys, I've been
totaling the bills here...

44:15.178 --> 44:17.513
and well, looks like we won't
make money on this property.

44:17.597 --> 44:19.682
But with Stone's original fee...

44:19.765 --> 44:21.684
and the reward money
on Juarez...

44:21.767 --> 44:23.352
we could break even.

44:23.436 --> 44:25.438
I thought we'd donate the fee
to the Relief Fund.

44:25.563 --> 44:26.647
To the Relief Fund.

44:26.772 --> 44:27.899
That's a good move, Hannibal...

44:27.982 --> 44:30.193
because those people need
the money more than we do.

44:33.779 --> 44:36.199
You're such a nice guy.

44:37.390 --> 44:38.367
Thanks.

44:38.451 --> 44:39.744
Yo, A-Team.

44:43.414 --> 44:46.709
You know, I knew all along that
thing was a military marvel.

44:46.876 --> 44:48.377
Yeah, it worked
pretty well, Joe.

44:48.461 --> 44:49.587
It's the way I designed it.

44:49.795 --> 44:52.048
Hey, Joe, there's a few modifications
you should know about.

44:52.131 --> 44:53.174
Whoa...

44:53.257 --> 44:55.760
let's not try and take
the glory here, my friend.

44:56.010 --> 44:57.637
I know every inch of that baby.

44:57.720 --> 44:59.764
That vehicle is
like a part of me.

45:00.014 --> 45:02.934
Together we form
a single fighting machine.

45:03.059 --> 45:05.811
Yeah, you gotta give credit
where credit is due, B.A.

45:07.438 --> 45:09.357
Hey, Mr. Block Captain.

45:09.482 --> 45:11.901
How about getting this monster
out of the street, huh?

45:12.068 --> 45:13.152
It's scaring my kid.

45:13.277 --> 45:15.529
Sure, Pete, no problem.

45:16.405 --> 45:18.282
And that's no monster, pal.

45:18.407 --> 45:20.576
That's the home defense
weapon of the '80s.

45:20.701 --> 45:22.787
We may be talking
a whole new industry here.

45:22.870 --> 45:25.081
Skrylow Home Securities.

45:39.762 --> 45:41.764
Can't seem
to get this thing started.

45:42.682 --> 45:44.016
See you, Joe.

45:44.475 --> 45:45.476
Wait a minute.

45:45.559 --> 45:47.228
Hey, Joe,
you don't need our help.

45:47.311 --> 45:49.313
You and that machine are one.

45:50.648 --> 45:52.400
We don't want
to miss the curtain.

45:53.025 --> 45:54.068
Guys.

45:54.151 --> 45:56.988
Thanks again, Joe,
for bailing us out.

45:57.530 --> 45:58.656
Right.

45:59.115 --> 46:00.283
Fellows...

46:01.826 --> 46:04.287
how am I supposed to get this
thing back in the garage?

46:05.305 --> 46:11.689
