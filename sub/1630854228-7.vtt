WEBVTT

00:03.087 --> 00:04.628

- We got sunscreen.
We got water.

00:04.728 --> 00:06.109
We got toys for the twins.

00:06.210 --> 00:08.392
You guys are officially
playground-ready.

00:08.492 --> 00:09.803
- Why can't we just hang out
here?

00:09.903 --> 00:11.403
- Because you need
to connect with nature

00:11.504 --> 00:12.385
and get some fresh air.
- And, also, we're not

00:12.464 --> 00:13.886
giving you a choice.

00:13.986 --> 00:15.127
- But we're too old
for the playground.

00:15.226 --> 00:16.889
- Yeah. It's humiliating.

00:16.989 --> 00:18.170
- I'll give you guys
20 bucks each

00:18.270 --> 00:19.651
if you go right now.
- Yes.

00:19.751 --> 00:21.052
- I can work with that.
- [gasps] Awesome.

00:21.152 --> 00:22.894
- Sweet.
- This doesn't make it okay.

00:22.994 --> 00:25.456
- Wait, you forgot the twins.

00:25.556 --> 00:27.698
- [chuckles]
Much respect, Kelvin.

00:27.798 --> 00:29.219
Well-played.
- Pleasure doing business

00:29.319 --> 00:31.501
with you.
- Kids are gone.

00:31.601 --> 00:34.863
Unfortunately for you,
that was the easy part.

00:34.964 --> 00:36.745
- Oh, are you sure
you don't want to stay?

00:36.845 --> 00:38.707
- To help you tell your dad
about his secret love child

00:38.806 --> 00:40.187
who tracked you down
and is desperate

00:40.287 --> 00:41.949
to connect
with her long-lost father?

00:42.049 --> 00:44.052
No.

00:44.732 --> 00:46.354
- But I put out
two kinds of hummus.

00:46.454 --> 00:48.235
- Oh, honey, there isn't
enough hummus in the world.

00:48.335 --> 00:49.917
- Hey, can I go
with you guys?

00:50.016 --> 00:51.638
[together] Connor.
- Why do we have to tell him?

00:51.738 --> 00:53.400
- Harmony said it would be
better coming from us.

00:53.500 --> 00:54.540
- Yeah, come on, man.
It's the right thing to do.

00:54.619 --> 00:56.402
I mean, she is our half-sister.

00:56.501 --> 01:00.365
- True. But she's also
half not our sister.

01:00.464 --> 01:02.207
And I'm thinking
maybe we focus on that half.

01:02.306 --> 01:03.687
- Denial is not gonna make
this go away.

01:03.788 --> 01:05.410
- Okay, I'm not in denial.

01:05.509 --> 01:08.412
I just don't want
to...acknowledge

01:08.511 --> 01:10.013
that this
is actually happening.

01:10.112 --> 01:11.054
- You guys better go.

01:11.154 --> 01:12.255
- Okay.
- Yeah.

01:12.354 --> 01:13.576
[doorbell rings]
- It's Marshall.

01:13.675 --> 01:14.937
- Oh, that's Dad.
He's early.

01:15.038 --> 01:17.057
Go, go, go.
- No, go under the--

01:17.158 --> 01:19.160
- Sorry, guys, forgot my phone.

01:21.642 --> 01:23.505
[dog barks in distance]

01:23.604 --> 01:27.228
I won't ask any questions
for a price.

01:27.328 --> 01:29.749
- Bleeding me dry. [chuckles]

01:29.850 --> 01:31.592
I'm proud of you, man.
- Thank you.

01:31.692 --> 01:33.752
- Oof. Okay. Good dry run.

01:33.853 --> 01:35.154
Now it's time
for the real thing.

01:35.253 --> 01:37.917
Marina, we will text you
when we're done.

01:38.015 --> 01:39.157
- Oh, they're long gone.

01:39.258 --> 01:40.639
- You know what?

01:40.739 --> 01:42.740
I think I just gave Kelvin
400 bucks.

01:44.341 --> 01:48.566
- ♪ Hey, hey, hey, hey ♪

01:48.664 --> 01:49.765
- I don't like this.

01:49.866 --> 01:51.769
Dad's gonna walk in all excited

01:51.868 --> 01:53.490
because we told him we want
to get into model trains,

01:53.590 --> 01:55.852
and then boom, secret baby.
- Look, man,

01:55.951 --> 01:57.252
it's the only thing
I could think to tell Dad

01:57.353 --> 01:58.773
where Mom wouldn't want
to come too.

01:58.872 --> 02:01.537
And we are not ready
for Mom to find out.

02:01.636 --> 02:03.818
- Yeah. And technically
we're starting with trains.

02:03.919 --> 02:05.419
- I don't want
to do that either.

02:05.520 --> 02:08.022
- Look, guys,
this is gonna be awkward, okay?

02:08.121 --> 02:10.504
It's hard to know what to say
in a situation like this.

02:10.603 --> 02:14.027
Lucky for us,
we got a writer in the family.

02:14.126 --> 02:15.227
- Oh, no.
- Oh, I don't like

02:15.328 --> 02:17.150
where this is going.
- Boom!

02:17.250 --> 02:19.272
I scripted
the entire conversation.

02:19.371 --> 02:20.713
- Oh, I don't like
where it went.

02:20.813 --> 02:24.115
- Enter Sarah, 36, emotional.
- Tom!

02:24.215 --> 02:25.957
- Yes! Perfect.
Exactly like that.

02:26.057 --> 02:27.439
- No, this is dumb.

02:27.539 --> 02:29.600
You can't script
something like this.

02:29.700 --> 02:31.482
All right?
You guys do your thing.

02:31.582 --> 02:33.083
I'm gonna go sit in a corner...

02:33.183 --> 02:34.725
[together]
And say as little as possible.

02:34.825 --> 02:36.606
- Page two.

02:36.706 --> 02:38.888
- Whoa, spooky.
- Okay, well, did you predict

02:38.988 --> 02:40.690
me throwing my script
in the trash?

02:40.790 --> 02:42.451
'Cause that's what I'm doing.

02:42.551 --> 02:44.573
- Oh, come on, Connor.
I gave you all the best jokes.

02:44.673 --> 02:46.254
- Tom, we do not need
a script, okay?

02:46.353 --> 02:48.456
Not when we have someone here

02:48.556 --> 02:52.420
who can lead an open, honest,
sometimes painful dialogue.

02:52.520 --> 02:54.221
- Ooh, I don't like
where this is going.

02:54.321 --> 02:57.304
- I am a professional therapist
with years of experience.

02:57.404 --> 02:59.826
- Yeah, but you can't be
professional about this.

02:59.926 --> 03:02.668
Sarah, you melt down
at the slightest family drama.

03:02.768 --> 03:04.590
- That's not true.
- Uh...

03:04.690 --> 03:06.191
- I thought
"Mr. Holland's Opus"

03:06.291 --> 03:07.512
was a little long.

03:07.612 --> 03:08.753
- Well, I thought
it was luminous.

03:08.852 --> 03:10.234
- Stop fighting!

03:10.335 --> 03:11.916
You're tearing me apart!

03:12.016 --> 03:13.436
I was a kid.

03:13.537 --> 03:14.999
I thought I was gonna marry
Lance Bass.

03:15.099 --> 03:16.600
People change.
- Look what you made me do.

03:16.700 --> 03:18.561
I'm stress-eating cheesy poufs
from a tub.

03:18.662 --> 03:20.483
No, don't look away.
This is on you, man.

03:20.583 --> 03:21.884
[knock at door]

03:21.984 --> 03:23.365
- "There is a knock
at the door."

03:23.465 --> 03:25.648
- Well, hey there,
junior conductors.

03:25.748 --> 03:27.529
- Oh, you're wearing a hat.
- Choo-choo.

03:27.629 --> 03:31.012
- Yeah. And guess who decided
to hop on the Hayworth Express.

03:31.112 --> 03:32.853
- Good morning!

03:32.953 --> 03:34.895
Or should is say,
"Tickets, please!"

03:34.995 --> 03:36.537
[both chuckle nervously]

03:36.637 --> 03:38.638
- Is that in your script?

03:41.321 --> 03:43.262
- I appreciate you helping us
redecorate the apartment.

03:43.362 --> 03:45.103
We lost so much
during the flood.

03:45.203 --> 03:47.666
- As your friend,
my heart goes out to you.

03:47.766 --> 03:50.188
As your designer,
it's probably for the best.

03:50.287 --> 03:52.290
- What?
- There was a lot of hemp.

03:54.452 --> 03:56.233
- Oh, hey, Min.

03:56.333 --> 03:58.835
- Uh, Denise.
How's my favorite tenant?

03:58.935 --> 04:00.436
- So happy to be back.

04:00.537 --> 04:02.118
And thank you
for all the repairs you made.

04:02.218 --> 04:04.359
- Anything for you and Sarah

04:04.460 --> 04:06.242
and those adorable kids
of yours--

04:06.341 --> 04:08.323
the, uh--the boy and the girl.

04:08.423 --> 04:09.444
- Kelvin and Shamiah.

04:09.543 --> 04:11.686
- Not ringing a bell.

04:11.786 --> 04:13.208
[door creaks]

04:13.308 --> 04:15.529
- So what are we thinking?

04:15.629 --> 04:17.131
- Oh, we're wide open.

04:17.231 --> 04:19.092
But we can't make
any major changes

04:19.192 --> 04:21.174
and we can't buy anything.

04:21.274 --> 04:24.697
- So...paint. Love it.

04:24.797 --> 04:27.419
Huh. What's going on here?

04:27.519 --> 04:29.862
- Oh, sorry.
Had to plug in the mixer.

04:29.962 --> 04:31.983
I am making cookies
for Heather upstairs.

04:32.083 --> 04:33.424
She just broke up
with her boyfriend.

04:33.524 --> 04:35.026
She loves toxic men

04:35.126 --> 04:36.587
just as much as she loves
my oatmeal raisin.

04:36.687 --> 04:38.669
- No, uh, why is there
an extension cord?

04:38.769 --> 04:40.110
- Well, they covered

04:40.210 --> 04:41.631
the kitchen outlets
with drywall.

04:41.731 --> 04:43.433
So we had to run a cord
from the bathroom

04:43.533 --> 04:45.795
because the living room outlets
are all full.

04:45.895 --> 04:47.236
But it's fine.
- But what if you want

04:47.336 --> 04:48.677
to close the bathroom door?

04:48.777 --> 04:49.998
- Oh, then it's a whole thing.

04:50.098 --> 04:52.280
- Denise, this is not fine.

04:52.380 --> 04:53.882
You should ask your landlord
to fix it.

04:53.982 --> 04:55.963
She seemed nice.
- She's landlord nice,

04:56.063 --> 04:57.685
not friend nice.
I don't want to push it.

04:57.785 --> 04:59.566
- It's not pushing it.
She likes you.

04:59.666 --> 05:01.888
Just turn on that Denise charm.

05:01.988 --> 05:03.450
- It would be good
to make a piece of toast

05:03.550 --> 05:05.631
while someone's peeing.
- That's the dream.

05:07.073 --> 05:08.534
- What are we gonna do?

05:08.634 --> 05:10.055
We were supposed to tell Dad
about Harmony

05:10.155 --> 05:11.296
so that he could tell Mom
about Harmony.

05:11.396 --> 05:12.778
Far away from here.

05:12.878 --> 05:14.699
- I don't know.
What does your script say?

05:14.799 --> 05:16.341
- Well, there's
some killer back-and-forth

05:16.441 --> 05:17.982
between you and me.

05:18.082 --> 05:19.663
And I gave Connor
this Sorkin-level monologue

05:19.763 --> 05:21.025
about how he looks up to me
as a big brother,

05:21.125 --> 05:22.546
but I didn't expect
Mom to show up.

05:22.646 --> 05:23.707
- We just have to get her
out of here.

05:23.807 --> 05:25.829
So follow my lead.

05:25.929 --> 05:28.511
Mom, definitely did not expect
to see you today.

05:28.611 --> 05:30.152
- But now that she's here,

05:30.252 --> 05:31.994
we're just trainin' it up.

05:32.094 --> 05:34.756
You know?
Just five grown people

05:34.856 --> 05:36.558
talking about trains
and nothing else.

05:36.658 --> 05:38.199
- Yeah, it's just--
I always thought

05:38.299 --> 05:39.800
that you hated this stuff.
You know, you called

05:39.900 --> 05:41.962
the model train store
the "creepo depot."

05:42.062 --> 05:44.084
- Well, that's before I heard
this podcast

05:44.184 --> 05:46.166
about keeping the spark alive
in your marriage.

05:46.266 --> 05:47.527
You've heard of podcasts?

05:47.627 --> 05:49.628
They're like radio shows
for your phone.

05:50.629 --> 05:52.211
- Yeah, I'll have to check
those out.

05:52.311 --> 05:54.172
- Well, this one said
that partners should take

05:54.272 --> 05:56.094
an interest
in each other's hobbies.

05:56.194 --> 05:58.016
So I've made my peace
with trains,

05:58.116 --> 05:59.937
and Marshall is watching
musicals.

06:00.037 --> 06:02.259
- Who knew Alexander Hamilton
was a rapper?

06:02.359 --> 06:04.021
- Right.

06:04.121 --> 06:06.423
Um, well, the--the kids
are at the park.

06:06.523 --> 06:08.825
- Yeah, uh, maybe you want
to go hang out with them.

06:08.925 --> 06:10.786
That'd be fun.
- Oh, well...

06:10.886 --> 06:13.389
I didn't bring my sun hat.
- Mm.

06:13.489 --> 06:16.111
Well, guess you just gotta
hang here with us.

06:16.211 --> 06:17.632
So, Dad, you were telling me
about coal.

06:17.732 --> 06:19.474
The train--the train eats it,
yeah?

06:19.574 --> 06:20.995
- You know, that's too bad,
because the kids were saying

06:21.095 --> 06:22.596
that they were gonna put on
a musical

06:22.696 --> 06:24.278
and that they needed a director
or something.

06:24.378 --> 06:25.879
- Really?
- Yeah.

06:25.979 --> 06:27.520
- Well, luckily I do have
my director's hat.

06:27.620 --> 06:29.802
That's one I never take off.
[both chuckle]

06:29.902 --> 06:31.123
Marshall?

06:31.223 --> 06:32.765
- Yeah, no, no,
you go ahead, honey.

06:32.865 --> 06:36.248
I think I can conduct
myself here without you.

06:36.348 --> 06:38.349
- [chuckles] Thanks, sweetie.

06:39.791 --> 06:42.213
- So when the contractors
put up the new wall,

06:42.313 --> 06:45.496
I think they may have covered
the outlets or something.

06:45.596 --> 06:47.017
I'm sure it was an accident.

06:47.117 --> 06:49.819
I mean, there were four
and now there's zero

06:49.919 --> 06:51.380
which is less.

06:51.480 --> 06:53.943
And that would totally
not even be a big deal

06:54.043 --> 06:56.705
but that's where we get
our electricity.

06:56.805 --> 06:59.707
And that is very helpful
in this modern world of ours.

06:59.807 --> 07:01.749
- It was always like that.
- What?

07:01.849 --> 07:04.512
- I'm sorry, a-a kitchen
without outlets?

07:04.612 --> 07:06.153
- Yeah.
- I mean...

07:06.253 --> 07:07.594
- I don't know.

07:07.694 --> 07:08.955
[chuckles]
Maybe there weren't four,

07:09.055 --> 07:11.678
but I do remember
at least some.

07:11.778 --> 07:13.879
- No, it was always like that.

07:13.979 --> 07:15.721
You've been away for so long,

07:15.821 --> 07:17.282
you probably don't remember.

07:17.382 --> 07:19.164
- Well, I-I was living here

07:19.264 --> 07:21.966
for several years before then.
- You're just confused.

07:22.066 --> 07:24.008
I have to get
back to scraping gum.

07:24.108 --> 07:25.970
- Okay. Well, thank you.

07:26.070 --> 07:28.071
- Always happy to help.

07:29.953 --> 07:32.775
- What was that?
"Okay. Well, thanks."

07:32.875 --> 07:34.497
- Marina,
it's a delicate dance.

07:34.597 --> 07:37.179
She says no.
I make her cookies every week.

07:37.279 --> 07:38.940
In six months,
she puts in one outlet.

07:39.040 --> 07:41.943
And then I bide my time,
make her a pie,

07:42.043 --> 07:43.304
and then she puts in two.

15:27.034 --> 15:28.294
with Owen Wilson.

15:28.395 --> 15:30.656
- Who needed $4,200
to make a movie.

15:30.756 --> 15:32.418
- Oh, my God.
- It wasn't Owen Wilson.

15:32.518 --> 15:35.221
- Enough with the lies!
Mom, it was about the affair.

15:35.321 --> 15:37.303
- No, it's not.
- The affair?

15:37.403 --> 15:40.184
What are we talking about?
- Me...

15:40.285 --> 15:42.386
and Marina.
I know.

15:42.487 --> 15:43.747
It's sad. You just--

15:43.847 --> 15:44.789
you never see
these things coming.

15:44.889 --> 15:46.230
- I knew it.

15:46.329 --> 15:47.911
She was always a reach
for you, Tom.

15:48.011 --> 15:49.553
- Wait a second, w--

15:49.653 --> 15:51.274
why do you assume
she's the one who cheated?

15:51.374 --> 15:52.716
- Tom, you're wearing a shirt
about punctuation.

15:52.815 --> 15:54.797
- Everybody just listen to me,
okay?

15:54.896 --> 15:56.919
I am a professional therapist.

15:57.019 --> 15:58.520
- What is going on?
- Okay.

15:58.620 --> 16:01.043
Stand down, kids.

16:01.143 --> 16:03.605
Mur, I've got something

But no cookie

16:18.918 --> 16:20.619
about that loft.

Especially not oatmeal raisin.

in the building

16:24.761 --> 16:26.184
seemed to like them.

16:26.284 --> 16:28.506
And it's funny,
when I was delivering them,

16:28.606 --> 16:30.266
a lot
of the tenants were talking

16:30.366 --> 16:32.309
about issues they were having
in their apartments

16:32.409 --> 16:34.471
and how resistant you were
to fixing them.

16:34.571 --> 16:36.232

16:36.332 --> 16:38.514
And all the units--
- Have always been like that.

16:38.613 --> 16:40.315
- Mm.
- It's funny how that works.

16:40.415 --> 16:42.156
- Yeah,
so while they were talking,

16:42.256 --> 16:43.477
all of the neighbors decided

16:43.578 --> 16:45.319
that since Denise
is so friendly,

16:45.419 --> 16:48.923
she should head up a-
a tenants' union.

16:49.023 --> 16:50.884
- A union?
- Yeah.

16:50.984 --> 16:53.807
It's so hard for us to get
things fixed individually.

16:53.906 --> 16:55.809
But that's the beauty
of a union--

16:55.909 --> 16:59.292
there are a lot of us
with a lot of problems.

16:59.391 --> 17:02.014
- And if the problems
don't get fixed,

17:02.114 --> 17:03.853

the tenants can always go

17:03.955 --> 17:05.815

to watch out

17:12.682 --> 17:13.744
for the extension cord.

17:13.843 --> 17:15.844
It can be a bit of a hazard.

17:16.886 --> 17:18.307
- You know what?

17:18.408 --> 17:20.790
I am going to get
those outlets fixed.

17:20.889 --> 17:22.949
- Aw. And the loft?

17:40.545 --> 17:41.966
But then at one point
Mom was laughing.

17:42.065 --> 17:43.527
And I'm not a great lip-reader,

17:43.629 --> 17:45.690
but I think
Dad might have said,

17:45.791 --> 17:48.132
"I'm taking up the clarinet,
Mr. President."

17:48.233 --> 17:49.853
- Really? Not a--not a great...
- Yeah.

17:49.954 --> 17:51.495
- Lip-reader.
- Yeah, I don't think

17:51.594 --> 17:53.177
that was said.
- You know, we were so focused

17:53.276 --> 17:56.218
on the best way to tell them
or not tell them.

17:56.319 --> 17:59.302
But this was gonna be messy
regardless.

to script everything out.

18:01.764 --> 18:04.746
I think it was my way
of controlling the situation.

- Well, I'm sorry
I'm a bad therapist

18:06.408 --> 18:08.409

- Yeah.

18:11.411 --> 18:13.553
I'm not sorry for anything.

what I was expecting

18:20.379 --> 18:23.161
when you invited us over
to talk about model trains.

18:23.262 --> 18:25.642
- Technically,
we only invited Dad, so--

18:25.744 --> 18:27.245
- Your father and I
are divorcing...

18:27.344 --> 18:28.406

18:30.307 --> 18:31.809
from the facts
we have to deal with.

18:31.908 --> 18:34.170
- Okay, so you're not getting
a divorce?

18:34.271 --> 18:36.452
- No, but I can see
how you would think that

18:36.552 --> 18:38.054
since she said
the word "divorce."

18:38.155 --> 18:39.855
- Yeah, we've been
through a lot together.

18:39.956 --> 18:41.776

18:41.878 --> 18:43.859
at this man
than you can imagine.

at your office Christmas party

I had too much eggnog
and I told Jerry Donahue

back to normal.

out of here.

19:42.809 --> 19:43.870

did you have that night?

19:43.969 --> 19:45.972

like Marshall and Muriel

19:48.172 --> 19:49.995
are gonna be okay.
- Yup.

I always saw
