on the highway into chester?

10:00.600 --> 10:02.767

Worked over.

10:03.804 --> 10:05.503
- So, t-that's a yes?

10:05.639 --> 10:08.039
- A colleague asked her
to reconsider her position

10:08.075 --> 10:10.642
On the moonshine's place
in the business association.

10:10.644 --> 10:12.176
- It was very considerate,

10:12.245 --> 10:14.446
But a strongly-worded email
may have done the trick.

10:14.448 --> 10:16.580

about this yesterday.

10:49.516 --> 10:50.815

10:50.817 --> 10:52.817
- Does this place need
a little update?

10:52.819 --> 10:55.153
Yes.
- Yes. (giggles)

10:55.155 --> 10:58.022

And all I had to do
was throw some eggs!

39:31.770 --> 39:33.803
(laughs ecstatically)

39:33.872 --> 39:36.272
Well... What do I do now?

39:36.341 --> 39:39.809
Like, getting my diploma
was sort of my whole plan.

39:39.878 --> 39:42.245
- I dunno, college?

39:42.247 --> 39:43.913
A real career?

39:44.048 --> 39:46.015
You can do whatever you want,
crystal.

39:47.952 --> 39:49.685
- (screams happily)

39:51.623 --> 39:53.189
(screams)

39:53.324 --> 39:55.758
You will jump for joy with me!

39:55.761 --> 39:57.894
Come on!

39:57.963 --> 40:00.262
Yeah! Ha, ha! Yes!!

40:02.200 --> 40:03.500

40:03.635 --> 40:05.568

40:05.570 --> 40:08.704
<i> Is today gonna be another</i>
<i> marathon of the mundane?</i>

40:08.740 --> 40:12.875
<i> Or should we venture</i>
<i> into the great unknown?</i>

40:14.746 --> 40:18.380
Okay, my new show, time
to flash the unknown my junk.

40:18.417 --> 40:21.684
I have been hanging
on to a lot of baggage.

40:23.321 --> 40:25.187
Mistakes.

40:25.223 --> 40:26.722
And apparently an old
decorative pillow

40:26.724 --> 40:29.391
That smells like hash and ass.

40:29.428 --> 40:32.929
But the time has come for
a spiritual purge, people.

40:32.998 --> 40:35.665
I'm gonna lay it all bare.

40:35.667 --> 40:38.267
But... Don't think that
you're off the hook.

40:38.303 --> 40:40.470
If you've been hanging on
to something,

40:40.472 --> 40:43.272
Whether it be an orphaned sock
from an ex,

40:43.341 --> 40:46.676
A residual shame about the
taxidermy you beat off to.

40:46.745 --> 40:49.378

41:03.829 --> 41:06.362
Come on!

41:06.431 --> 41:08.231
Sammy, my man!

41:08.300 --> 41:11.901
Crystal said I was inside
too much playing video games.

41:12.036 --> 41:13.569
This is what I call
a workaround.

41:14.673 --> 41:16.940
I talked to mom and dad.
- Good for you, bro.

41:17.075 --> 41:20.376
They cool?
- Yeah, they were...

41:20.445 --> 41:22.177
Kinda the best.

41:22.214 --> 41:23.579
And-and dad dug up
a license plate

41:23.648 --> 41:26.316
He thinks had something to do
with my birth mom.

41:26.318 --> 41:28.384
- Detective bros
back on the case?

41:28.520 --> 41:30.720
- Yeah.
- Oh! I betcha terry

41:30.855 --> 41:32.989
Would totally run the plates
for us on the dl.

41:32.991 --> 41:35.325
Maybe see if it's registered
to an address, and then we--

41:35.327 --> 41:36.726
- Already did.

41:36.861 --> 41:39.262
Got a name.
And an address.

41:39.397 --> 41:40.629
(paper crinkles)

41:42.200 --> 41:44.000
- Violà arnold.

41:44.002 --> 41:46.068
(emotional exhale)
- yeah.

41:46.137 --> 41:48.370
That could be her, ry.

41:50.075 --> 41:53.076
That could be my birth mom.

41:53.211 --> 41:54.977
- This is huge!

41:55.046 --> 41:57.479
- Yeah! Yeah, it is.

42:14.499 --> 42:16.332
Safe and sound.

42:17.502 --> 42:20.303
You can um, drop by and
grab your cut whenever.

42:21.506 --> 42:24.040
- My cut?
I like the sound of that.

42:24.109 --> 42:26.142
- I have to say, for someone
who didn't know

42:26.211 --> 42:27.843
What money laundering
was a day ago,

42:29.080 --> 42:31.213
You're a natural.

42:31.249 --> 42:33.182
- Yeah? I'm worried.

42:33.184 --> 42:34.684
- Worried, why?

42:34.819 --> 42:36.786
- Because I kinda loved it.

42:36.921 --> 42:39.122
- Ah.
- The thrill, the risk.

42:39.257 --> 42:40.890
The adrenaline.

42:40.892 --> 42:43.425
Ooh, felt like I was on drugs.
- Hmm.

42:44.596 --> 42:47.864
First-crime-high.
- Hmm, technically second.

42:47.999 --> 42:49.365
- (chuckles)

42:51.970 --> 42:54.070
Better be careful.
