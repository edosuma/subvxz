WEBVTT

00:02.044 --> 00:04.880
<i>- Previously on "Designated Survivor"...</i>
- It's about the NATO summit.

00:05.006 --> 00:07.466
The new French ambassador
wanted to talk about nukes.

00:07.591 --> 00:09.051
It's an opening to de-escalate.

00:09.176 --> 00:11.637
There's enough explosives in here
to blow up three Capitols.

00:11.762 --> 00:13.556
She's been kidnapped.

00:13.681 --> 00:15.391
She was looking
into Browning Reed.

00:15.516 --> 00:17.727
Agent Wells is convinced
that the ex-C.E.O. Patrick Lloyd's

00:17.852 --> 00:19.103
involved with the conspiracy.

00:19.228 --> 00:22.440
I'm brooming any connection between you,
Browning Reed, and the Capitol mission.

00:22.565 --> 00:26.402
<i>Soon, there'll be no paper trail
whatsoever, and Agent Wells is contained.</i>

00:26.527 --> 00:28.237
Abe Leonard has eaten up
everything I've fed him.

00:28.362 --> 00:29.572
When are we gonna see
something from him?

00:29.697 --> 00:32.116
Any day, I expect.

00:33.617 --> 00:35.327
Since the attack at the Capitol,

00:35.453 --> 00:37.496
references to Browning Reed
have been deleted.

00:37.621 --> 00:39.331
If we find out who deleted these files...

00:39.457 --> 00:42.043
We find our traitor.

00:52.094 --> 00:54.764
<i>Be advised.
All security teams...</i>

02:12.049 --> 02:14.135
Hey, Seth, you okay?

02:15.886 --> 02:17.930
Yeah, I'm sorry.
Uh, I-I don't know what's happening.

02:18.055 --> 02:20.432
- I don't usually get airsick.
- Oh.

02:20.558 --> 02:23.269
And to think, it's your first time
on <i>Air Force One,</i> too.

02:23.394 --> 02:26.105
Hey, Seth, look.

02:26.230 --> 02:28.274
You can send this one
to your mom, as well.

02:30.568 --> 02:32.069
Time to rally, son.

02:32.194 --> 02:34.280
We got to gaggle with the press
before we land.

02:45.875 --> 02:47.168
Yes.

02:48.377 --> 02:51.172
- Bad time?
- No. Come on in.

02:52.715 --> 02:56.427
I, uh... I think the pressure
of his first international summit

02:56.552 --> 02:58.971
may have gotten
to your press secretary.

02:59.096 --> 03:00.890
And I just wondered how <i>you're</i> doing.

03:01.015 --> 03:04.768
- I'm fine. Is Seth all right?
- Yeah, just a case of the jitters.

03:05.269 --> 03:08.647
He'll get over it as soon as he realizes
that a NATO summit is no different

03:08.772 --> 03:11.817
than an outsized cabinet meeting
in a lot of different languages.

03:11.942 --> 03:14.028
I hope it's that simple.

03:15.738 --> 03:17.489
Are they gonna think
that it's presumptuous of me,

03:17.615 --> 03:18.991
putting an initiative on the table?

03:19.116 --> 03:22.620
Hell no. You're the president
of the United States.

03:22.745 --> 03:24.663
Right.

03:24.788 --> 03:26.665
I know I'm not the negotiator
that you are--

03:26.790 --> 03:28.292
Ah, don't sell yourself short.

03:28.417 --> 03:31.003
You know, we may have
different styles, Tom,

03:31.128 --> 03:33.505
but I think that's what makes us
a good team.

03:33.631 --> 03:35.633
The professor and the politician.

03:36.800 --> 03:39.011
You give them the facts,
and I'll twist their arms.

03:39.136 --> 03:40.930
That works for me.

03:41.055 --> 03:43.641
I know how important this is to you.

03:45.643 --> 03:46.644
Yeah.

03:47.436 --> 03:50.940
The arms control was going to be
a priority of my second term.

03:51.815 --> 03:54.151
Well... now it's <i>our</i> priority.

03:57.238 --> 03:59.365
I don't care
about your overtime.

03:59.490 --> 04:01.617
No, you search everywhere...

04:01.742 --> 04:04.370
...and then when you've done that,
search it again.

04:04.495 --> 04:06.705
Still nothing?

04:06.830 --> 04:09.458
No. I got every agency
in the country looking.

04:10.668 --> 04:13.087
- She knows how to take care of herself.
- Yeah.

04:13.796 --> 04:15.339
Where are you
with the Browning Reed investigation?

04:15.464 --> 04:17.298
I got Chuck Russink
coming in to help out.

04:17.423 --> 04:20.135
Russink? You serious?
He's a space cadet.

04:20.261 --> 04:21.803
Hannah trusts him.

04:22.805 --> 04:24.556
Whatever it takes, I guess.

04:24.682 --> 04:26.558
I was gonna pay, Ms. Rhodes.

04:26.684 --> 04:30.104
No, seriously. I'll get it.
Where's our server?

04:35.276 --> 04:37.861
- Will you guys excuse me a second?
- Yeah.

04:38.362 --> 04:39.530
What?

04:42.491 --> 04:44.827
- Hey, you.
- Hey. Hey.

04:44.952 --> 04:47.830
How you doing? It's good to see you.

04:47.955 --> 04:51.250
Oh, oh. Emily Rhodes,
meet my cousin, Nadia Espinosa.

04:51.375 --> 04:52.835
It's a pleasure.

04:52.960 --> 04:55.337
Hi. You work
for Congresswoman Yoshida, right?

04:55.462 --> 04:57.214
That's right.

04:57.339 --> 04:59.425
- How's that going?
- I love it.

04:59.550 --> 05:02.594
I mean, it's great to be able
to collaborate with good people.

05:02.720 --> 05:05.764
Wow. Are you sure you two are related?

05:05.889 --> 05:07.308
Yeah, I wonder all the time.

05:09.977 --> 05:11.437
I need another beer.
Do you guys want anything?

05:11.562 --> 05:13.397
- No, I'm good, thanks.
- No, thank you.

05:14.815 --> 05:16.942
So, POTUS is heading up to Toronto.

05:17.067 --> 05:18.694
Yes. The White House is all mine.

05:18.819 --> 05:21.280
No, seriously,
it's his first NATO summit.

05:21.405 --> 05:23.741
First time out of the country.
Polls are high.

05:24.241 --> 05:28.245
- I mean, he's on a roll. So are you.
- I do have to admit, it feels good.

05:28.370 --> 05:30.789
What about you?
Are you gonna follow Hookstraten?

05:30.914 --> 05:33.250
No, she did offer, but, uh...

05:33.375 --> 05:36.128
I don't see myself working
for the Secretary of Education.

05:36.253 --> 05:37.629
It's not exactly the fast lane.

05:37.755 --> 05:39.798
Let's just say, after you work
in the West Wing,

05:39.923 --> 05:41.717
everything feels like a step down.

05:42.551 --> 05:43.802
Well, just so you know,

05:43.927 --> 05:45.929
- I was not opposed to Hookstraten for V.P.
- Mm.

05:46.055 --> 05:48.640
I think it would've been great
to be working together again.

05:48.766 --> 05:52.102
Yeah, it would've been. It's Washington.
Anything can happen, right?

05:52.770 --> 05:54.355
And it usually does.

05:54.897 --> 05:56.190
Yeah.

05:57.358 --> 06:00.361
- I should get back.
- Thanks for stopping by.

06:12.873 --> 06:17.961
So, we attend the general reception
for 30 minutes, smile for the cameras,

06:18.087 --> 06:20.172
then we retreat to a hospitality suite

06:20.297 --> 06:24.176
I set up for select members
of the Nuclear Planning Group.

06:24.301 --> 06:27.846
That gives us a chance to start some
lobbying before the general session.

06:27.971 --> 06:30.015
- Smart.
- Well, it's not my first rodeo, son.

06:31.475 --> 06:36.313
Now, our primary target is French
Prime Minister Justine Massett.

06:36.438 --> 06:39.858
<i>Sharp as a tack
and as chauvinistic as Joan of Arc.</i>

06:39.983 --> 06:43.487
- She can be very prickly.
- Why would she be?

06:43.612 --> 06:46.698
It was the French who wanted us to bring
up arms reduction in the first place.

06:46.824 --> 06:48.992
Yes. Privately.

06:50.077 --> 06:54.039
But in front of NATO, the French want us
to bring up the initiative first,

06:54.164 --> 06:56.667
giving them an opportunity to criticize

06:56.792 --> 06:59.128
or even withdraw, if they so choose.

06:59.253 --> 07:02.673
It's all part of the game: don't stick
your neck out if you don't have to.

07:03.841 --> 07:05.968
Then there's Jonas Grottke,

07:06.093 --> 07:08.720
<i>just re-elected as German Chancellor.</i>

07:08.846 --> 07:11.849
<i>He's also a chairman of
NATO's Nuclear Planning Group.</i>

07:11.974 --> 07:14.184
Strong ally. Got you covered there.

07:14.309 --> 07:16.520
Good. One less thing
for me to worry about.

07:16.645 --> 07:19.523
The one unknown to me
is Aruna Mahajan.

07:19.648 --> 07:23.402
<i>The first British Indian
Prime minister in U.K. history.</i>

07:23.527 --> 07:27.573
Fiercely independent
but was able to forge a coalition

07:27.698 --> 07:30.701
and under extremely
turbulent conditions.

07:30.826 --> 07:33.328
- Well, we have something in common.
- True enough.

07:33.454 --> 07:34.538
I can work with that.

07:35.873 --> 07:37.249
What?

07:37.374 --> 07:39.168
Thank you.

08:11.909 --> 08:13.076
Hey.

08:16.413 --> 08:19.917
Mayday, mayday.
This is FBI Agent Hannah Wells. Mayday.

08:20.042 --> 08:21.960
<i>...FBI Agent
Hannah Wells. Mayday.</i>

08:22.085 --> 08:24.463
<i>Mayday. This is...Hannah Wells.</i>

08:24.588 --> 08:26.965
<i>Mayday, this is Hannah Wells.</i>

08:27.090 --> 08:30.302
<i>Hannah Wells,</i> this is Coast Guard
Station 142, Indian River.

08:33.096 --> 08:36.808
Coast Guard Station 142
calling the ship <i>Hannah Wells.</i>

08:38.602 --> 08:40.145
This is FBI Agent Hannah Wells.

08:40.270 --> 08:41.730
Mayda--

09:00.207 --> 09:02.042
Unh!

09:12.970 --> 09:15.806
To begin, I want to thank you all
for being here.

09:15.931 --> 09:18.684
As you know, in addition
to tomorrow's regular schedule,

09:18.809 --> 09:21.603
the United States
will be introducing an initiative

09:21.728 --> 09:24.022
that would reduce NATO's nuclear arsenal.

09:24.147 --> 09:27.150
Now, I want to be absolutely clear
that this is a proposed

09:27.276 --> 09:29.361
weapons-reduction change,
not a change in doctrine.

09:29.486 --> 09:32.614
And it's entirely predicated
upon the Russian Federation

09:32.739 --> 09:35.993
scaling back
its strategic nuclear weapons

09:36.118 --> 09:39.121
in proportional response
to NATO's actions,

09:39.246 --> 09:43.208
something that the Russian president
has assured me he is ready to do.

09:43.333 --> 09:46.295
- What, you believe him, Cornelius?
- Yeah, I do.

09:46.420 --> 09:47.671
On what basis?

09:47.796 --> 09:50.340
On the basis of our 20-year relationship

09:50.465 --> 09:53.343
and being able to tell
when he's lying and when he's not.

09:55.512 --> 09:58.890
And based on the fact
that it is in the interest of all sides

09:59.016 --> 10:03.562
to agree on anything that will lead
to a more stable and secure planet.

10:03.687 --> 10:06.732
Despite recent disruptions
to the world order,

10:06.857 --> 10:10.902
this is not the time
to retreat into isolationism or populism.

10:11.028 --> 10:14.239
This is the time to show
that global cooperation

10:14.364 --> 10:16.700
can and will lead us to a safer future.

10:16.825 --> 10:19.703
Not to mention that the way
we keep our nuclear arsenals

10:19.828 --> 10:21.997
is insanely expensive.

10:22.706 --> 10:25.083
It's intriguing, Mr. President,

10:25.208 --> 10:28.420
but Poland and Slovakia
have no nuclear weapons of our own.

10:28.545 --> 10:31.214
We rely on your
American nuclear umbrellas.

10:31.340 --> 10:35.010
So what can you offer
by way of a guarantee

10:35.135 --> 10:39.222
that our peace and our safety
will still be protected?

10:41.058 --> 10:44.645
The closest thing I can offer
to a guarantee is my word,

10:45.646 --> 10:49.066
not as Tom Kirkman,
but as President of the United States,

10:49.191 --> 10:51.068
your most steadfast ally.

10:51.193 --> 10:52.736
You can believe him there, Jozef.

10:54.237 --> 10:55.614
We can all believe him.

10:55.739 --> 11:00.035
Obviously, I am hoping for your support
at tomorrow's summit. Thank you.

11:00.160 --> 11:03.413
France looks forward to your proposal.

11:03.538 --> 11:05.499
I appreciate that, Madame.

11:11.755 --> 11:13.757
This isn't on the White House tour.

11:14.925 --> 11:18.261
Access to Agent Wells' office
is extremely restricted.

11:18.387 --> 11:19.888
Where is Hannah?

11:20.722 --> 11:22.391
On assignment.

11:27.270 --> 11:29.981
Any chance we can recover
those deleted Browning Reed files?

11:30.107 --> 11:34.152
Not without a time machine. Someone
ran a brute-force deletion program.

11:34.277 --> 11:38.156
It's the mother of data erasers. Cleaned
them right off the White House servers.

11:38.281 --> 11:40.784
- So we got nothing.
- I didn't say that.

11:40.909 --> 11:42.828
Because there were so many files
to begin with,

11:42.953 --> 11:45.789
whoever's been covering their tracks
has been deleting them in small batches

11:45.914 --> 11:47.499
over the past few months.

11:47.624 --> 11:51.086
There are only five files still remaining
associated with Browning Reed.

11:51.211 --> 11:53.171
Gonna need you to make copies
and print them up.

11:53.296 --> 11:55.132
Check this out.

11:56.925 --> 11:59.803
It's a digital fingerprint left behind
by the person who deleted the files.

11:59.928 --> 12:01.847
Now, they tend to be unique,
but if I'm good -

12:01.972 --> 12:03.682
and I like to think I am -

12:03.807 --> 12:06.643
I can program a trace
and plant it in the remaining files.

12:07.310 --> 12:09.354
So if the traitor tries
to delete any of them,

12:09.479 --> 12:12.023
we can track the user
back to an exact I.P. address.

12:12.149 --> 12:13.608
Exactly.

12:13.734 --> 12:15.736
How long will it take you
to build a trace?

12:16.319 --> 12:18.113
- A few hours?
- You got one.

12:19.489 --> 12:21.533
Those files are
the only lead to the insider,

12:21.658 --> 12:25.162
- and once they're deleted, we got nothing.
- No pressure, huh?

12:32.669 --> 12:35.881
Well, thank you.
Yes. Thank you very much.

12:36.006 --> 12:37.716
Well, that's it.

12:37.841 --> 12:41.553
Our proposal is the third item
on the agenda. We're on our way.

12:41.678 --> 12:43.597
- No media, right?
- Nope.

12:44.139 --> 12:46.892
Just you and 27 other leaders
of the free world.

12:47.017 --> 12:48.894
Relax, Tom.

12:49.019 --> 12:52.814
All we're asking is to start
a conversation that's long overdue.

12:52.939 --> 12:54.524
Come in.

12:55.609 --> 12:58.487
- Seth.
- Hey. Sorry to disturb you, Mr. President.

12:58.612 --> 13:00.572
I just, um, thought
you should see this right away.

13:09.706 --> 13:11.583
Why didn't we get a heads-up?

13:11.708 --> 13:14.252
We did. Abe asked me about Al-Sakar
a couple days ago, remember?

13:14.377 --> 13:15.921
Right.

13:16.046 --> 13:17.923
We stonewalled.
I thought that was the end of it.

13:18.048 --> 13:20.383
Then he published anyway.

13:20.509 --> 13:22.928
- <i>So, what's our plan?</i>
- This is total crap!

13:23.053 --> 13:25.764
We're figuring that out right now.
I'll call you back.

13:25.889 --> 13:27.933
I knew Abe Leonard.
He was a good reporter

13:28.058 --> 13:31.186
until he started getting
fast and loose with his sources.

13:31.311 --> 13:33.104
You should have no problem
shooting this one down.

13:33.230 --> 13:35.857
Just tell them it's nothing
but a big pack of lies.

13:35.982 --> 13:38.527
No, I want our position
to be that this is conjecture,

13:38.652 --> 13:41.780
but we will investigate
all of the allegations.

13:41.905 --> 13:44.574
Sorry, sir. Why not just openly
deny it if it's not true?

13:44.699 --> 13:47.702
Seth's right. Deflecting this now
is only gonna raise suspicion.

13:47.828 --> 13:50.288
Yeah, the American people
believe that we captured

13:50.413 --> 13:52.290
the terrorists responsible
for the Capitol bombing.

13:52.415 --> 13:54.459
This article says
that we got the wrong guy.

13:54.584 --> 13:56.586
I mean, if we don't push back hard now,

13:56.711 --> 13:58.713
confidence in the administration's
gonna tank.

14:02.259 --> 14:03.635
You can say that we're standing by

14:03.760 --> 14:06.137
our intelligence agencies
and our military officials.

14:06.263 --> 14:08.390
I'm sorry, Mr. President.
I don't think that goes far enough.

14:08.515 --> 14:11.726
- Just write it up and bring it back to me!
- Yes, sir.

14:19.609 --> 14:20.861
What the hell was that?

14:21.695 --> 14:23.196
It's how I have to handle this.

14:25.782 --> 14:28.952
You realize this story puts
your credibility at risk.

14:30.203 --> 14:32.664
Your 100 days,
everything we want to do here,

14:32.789 --> 14:35.292
goes right out the window
if you don't crush this right now.

14:36.585 --> 14:38.378
- I can't.
- Why not?

14:39.713 --> 14:41.423
Because it's true.

14:54.436 --> 14:55.896
Unbelievable.

14:56.396 --> 15:00.025
A homegrown conspiracy?
A possible traitor in the White House?

15:00.150 --> 15:01.318
Yeah.

15:02.152 --> 15:04.696
- And you didn't tell me?
- It was a matter of security.

15:04.821 --> 15:06.531
Emily doesn't know.
Neither does Seth.

15:06.656 --> 15:08.825
Well, I'm your Secretary of State,
for God's sake.

15:08.950 --> 15:12.162
I mean, I-I'm in the line of succession.
You didn't think you could trust me?

15:12.287 --> 15:13.955
- This isn't a matter of trust.
- The hell it's not!

15:14.080 --> 15:17.334
Now, I came out of retirement for you.
I put my legacy on the line for you!

15:17.459 --> 15:18.877
And this is how you repay me?!

15:19.002 --> 15:20.879
- I thought I had it handled.
- Well, you were wrong.

15:21.004 --> 15:23.882
You were dead wrong, and now my head
is on the block right along with yours!

15:24.007 --> 15:27.218
- Well, I probably should've let you in.
- That is the understatement of the year.

15:27.344 --> 15:30.555
I have seen you exercise poor judgment
before, Tom, but this takes the cake!

15:30.680 --> 15:33.558
Cornelius, I'm sorry if I offended you.
It's the last thing I wanted to do.

15:33.683 --> 15:36.394
But the president of the United States
has a responsibility

15:36.519 --> 15:40.523
to protect classified information
and ongoing investigations.

15:40.649 --> 15:42.901
This isn't a matter of trying
to mislead the American people.

15:43.026 --> 15:46.529
This is about trying to protect them.
And you should know that.

15:47.364 --> 15:50.492
Now, I've made a mistake, and I am sorry.

15:51.868 --> 15:53.828
But right now I need your counsel.

15:54.162 --> 15:55.830
What are my options?

15:58.208 --> 16:01.378
You don't have any.
That's the problem.

16:02.212 --> 16:04.589
You can't deny the story
without committing perjury,

16:04.714 --> 16:06.257
and you can't confirm it
without admitting

16:06.383 --> 16:08.176
that you still don't know
who's behind all this,

16:08.301 --> 16:10.679
throwing the whole American country
into a panic.

16:10.804 --> 16:12.931
That's why we need Seth
to buy us some time.

16:13.056 --> 16:16.768
But how much time? The jackals are
at the door, Mr. President.

16:16.893 --> 16:19.062
I think we're really close
to cracking this thing.

16:19.187 --> 16:20.438
Do you really?

16:20.563 --> 16:23.108
Your lead investigator is missing,
possibly dead.

16:23.233 --> 16:25.193
The man who tried
to kill you is still alive.

16:25.318 --> 16:27.570
And the mole in the White House
remains unknown.

16:29.572 --> 16:32.575
It looks to me like you're doubling down
on a mighty poor hand.

16:32.701 --> 16:34.828
Well, it's the only hand I was given.

16:37.580 --> 16:38.832
All right.

16:40.000 --> 16:41.584
We brass it out.

16:47.924 --> 16:49.426
This is Moss.

16:50.844 --> 16:52.053
Yes.

16:52.178 --> 16:54.597
Of course. We'll be right there.

16:56.933 --> 16:59.352
Our allies have requested
our presence downstairs.

17:01.938 --> 17:04.107
They want an explanation for the story.

17:09.029 --> 17:10.488
<i>Welcome back.</i>

17:10.613 --> 17:11.990
<i>We're joined now
by Pulitzer Prize-winning</i>

17:12.115 --> 17:14.325
<i>journalist Abe Leonard,
whose story</i>

17:14.451 --> 17:16.994
<i>in today's</i> New York Standard
<i>has raised serious questions</i>

17:17.119 --> 17:20.999
<i>about who was really responsible
for the attack on our Capitol.</i>

17:21.124 --> 17:22.916
<i>- Welcome, Abe.
- Thank you. It's good to be here.</i>

17:23.042 --> 17:26.588
<i>Let's start with the big headline.
Al-Sakar did</i> not <i>blow up the Capitol?</i>

17:26.713 --> 17:29.674
<i>No. They didn't have
the money or the manpower.</i>

17:29.799 --> 17:33.678
<i>Their leader, Majid Nassar,
was paid to take credit.</i>

17:33.803 --> 17:35.597
<i>Paid? By whom?</i>

17:35.722 --> 17:39.350
<i>Nestor Lozano, the man who tried
to assassinate President Kirkman.</i>

17:39.476 --> 17:41.686
<i>Yet our government
went after Majid Nassar,</i>

17:41.811 --> 17:44.147
<i>actually captured him
in a S.E.A.L. team raid where</i>

17:44.272 --> 17:47.776
<i>- the commanding officer was killed.
- I believe they were misled.</i>

17:47.901 --> 17:50.945
<i>- Misled by whom?
- Bad intelligence.</i>

17:51.071 --> 17:52.864
<i>They bought the story
Lozano was selling.</i>

17:52.989 --> 17:56.076
<i>But who was he protecting?</i>

18:01.081 --> 18:02.165
Whitaker.

18:02.290 --> 18:04.292
Are you watching Abe Leonard
on television?

18:04.417 --> 18:07.087
No, but I read his story.

18:08.630 --> 18:10.131
It's all working.

18:11.174 --> 18:13.384
Everyone's focused on the FBI, not us.

18:13.510 --> 18:16.679
Well, that's great, but where did he get
this stuff about Lozano?

18:16.805 --> 18:19.349
I don't know. He did that on his own.

18:19.474 --> 18:21.226
Well, he's treading on dangerous ground.

18:21.351 --> 18:24.104
Not really. He thinks Lozano's dead,
just like everyone else.

18:28.942 --> 18:30.693
Abe Leonard has served his purpose.

18:32.195 --> 18:34.280
Roger that.

18:36.991 --> 18:38.243
As I said, the president stands

18:38.368 --> 18:40.829
by our intelligence community
and our military.

18:40.954 --> 18:43.039
Answer the question, Seth.
Did Al-Sakar blow up the Capitol?

18:43.164 --> 18:44.916
That is the official explanation
at this time.

18:45.041 --> 18:46.209
But it could change?

18:46.334 --> 18:48.253
All I said is we're looking
into the allegations.

18:48.378 --> 18:50.255
So does that mean you don't know?

18:50.380 --> 18:51.589
It means we're looking into it.

18:51.714 --> 18:53.258
- Seth!
- Yes.

18:56.469 --> 18:57.846
Ah, see? A question about NATO.

18:57.971 --> 18:59.430
Unfortunately, my Spanish
is no longer as good.

18:59.556 --> 19:01.224
- Could you repeat the question?
<i>- Perdon.</i>

19:01.349 --> 19:03.935
Is President Kirkman telling
the NATO summit the truth?

19:04.060 --> 19:07.397
I've already answered this question.
Of course he's telling the truth.

19:07.522 --> 19:10.441
<i>If the president
stands by his intelligence,</i>

19:10.567 --> 19:12.443
<i>why is he looking into the allegations?</i>

19:12.569 --> 19:14.612
<i>Sure. So, I've tried
to be perfectly clear.</i>

19:14.737 --> 19:17.240
<i>You want answers.
The president wants answers.</i>

19:17.365 --> 19:19.742
<i>Which is why he is looking
into the allegations, okay?</i>

19:19.868 --> 19:22.537
<i>And he'll make a statement
to the public at the appropriate time,</i>

19:22.662 --> 19:25.415
<i>but right now he is focused
on the first NATO summit,</i>

19:25.540 --> 19:27.375
<i>which is what I would love
to answer questions about.</i>

19:35.758 --> 19:36.968
This is Foerstel.

19:37.093 --> 19:40.471
Special Agent Foerstel, this is
Chief Petty Officer Lucy Fernandez,

19:40.597 --> 19:42.974
U.S. Coast Guard,
Indian River, Delaware.

19:43.099 --> 19:46.311
We received a mayday call
from Hannah Wells last night.

19:46.436 --> 19:48.730
- You found her?
<i>- Not exactly, sir.</i>

19:48.855 --> 19:50.565
Uh, because of the static
of the distress call,

19:50.690 --> 19:52.233
we thought that Hannah Wells was a ship.

19:52.358 --> 19:54.485
It wasn't until we ran the call
through a digital filter

19:54.611 --> 19:57.614
that we realized she was saying
"FBI Agent Hannah Wells."

19:57.739 --> 19:59.657
Okay. I don't understand.

19:59.782 --> 20:02.243
- Do you have her or not?
- We don't.

20:02.368 --> 20:04.829
<i>In response to the mayday,
we scrambled an H-65 helicopter</i>

20:04.954 --> 20:07.665
and a response boat to the coordinates,
but the results were negative.

20:07.790 --> 20:09.167
Okay. So where does this leave us?

20:09.292 --> 20:10.585
We're working
on a broadened search grid,

20:10.710 --> 20:13.838
factoring in current changes,
but it's gonna take time.

20:13.963 --> 20:15.798
All right. I'm gonna be there
within the hour.

20:15.924 --> 20:17.967
I'm gonna want better answers than that.

20:43.159 --> 20:45.578
Peter MacLeish was a brother to me.

20:47.664 --> 20:49.666
You kill my family...

20:51.501 --> 20:53.294
I kill yours.

21:14.190 --> 21:16.192
Jason...

21:35.545 --> 21:36.671
Good morning.

21:36.796 --> 21:38.923
I know that there has been
a great deal of speculation

21:39.048 --> 21:40.842
with regards to an article
that was published

21:40.967 --> 21:43.052
in this morning's
<i>New York Standard.</i>

21:43.177 --> 21:46.097
Although I cannot confirm
or deny the allegations,

21:46.222 --> 21:49.350
I can tell you in confidence
that my government

21:49.475 --> 21:54.272
is in the middle of an extensive
investigation that is highly classified.

21:54.397 --> 21:57.025
Unfortunately at this time,
I cannot share that information with you

21:57.150 --> 21:58.735
because of reasons of national security.

21:58.860 --> 22:02.280
Mr. President, you can be assured
of our continued support.

22:02.405 --> 22:03.281
Thank you, Chancellor.

22:03.406 --> 22:05.867
Then, in the spirit
of mutual understanding,

22:05.992 --> 22:09.287
I suggest that we move over to the
initiative regarding nuclear disarmament.

22:09.412 --> 22:13.916
I'm sorry, Mr. President.
But France is not satisfied.

22:15.585 --> 22:18.129
May I remind the new American president

22:18.254 --> 22:20.465
that when he initiated a mission

22:20.590 --> 22:23.301
to capture Majid Nassar in Algeria,

22:23.426 --> 22:26.304
we allowed him to use French airspace.

22:26.429 --> 22:31.309
Spanish radar assets and Italian
naval support were also employed.

22:31.434 --> 22:34.479
Now, we must all face the fact
that we supported you

22:34.604 --> 22:37.648
under what might turn into
false pretenses.

22:37.774 --> 22:39.233
We deserve to know

22:39.359 --> 22:44.113
if Al-Sakar did not perpetrate
the Capitol bombing.

22:44.238 --> 22:46.491
I'm afraid my government agrees,
Mr. President.

22:46.616 --> 22:48.159
We have learned
from our mistakes in Iraq.

22:48.284 --> 22:51.412
We cannot discuss your initiative
any further without knowing the truth.

22:51.537 --> 22:53.831
If my esteemed colleagues will excuse me,

22:53.956 --> 22:57.335
you are not seriously suggesting
that the French and British

22:57.460 --> 22:59.670
don't have classified intelligence

22:59.796 --> 23:03.132
that they keep secret
for reasons of national security.

23:03.257 --> 23:04.842
<i>Mais oui.</i>

23:04.967 --> 23:09.347
Of course we have our discretions,
Secretary Moss.

23:09.472 --> 23:12.433
But we also have reason
to trust each other,

23:12.558 --> 23:16.187
a long history of cooperation
and experience.

23:16.312 --> 23:19.524
Monsieur Kirkman has no such history.

23:19.649 --> 23:24.821
He is president only because
the previous government was wiped out.

23:27.949 --> 23:29.992
No, my point is...

23:30.493 --> 23:34.288
how can we trust someone
who appears to be a...

23:34.414 --> 23:36.290
What's the word?

23:36.416 --> 23:38.835
<i>Gaffeur. Maladroit.</i>

23:38.960 --> 23:41.963
I believe the word
you're searching for is "blunderer."

23:43.965 --> 23:45.383
<i>Oui.</i>

23:45.508 --> 23:50.471
Who apparently abused
article five of the NATO charter

23:50.596 --> 23:55.435
by asking us to assist him
in going after the wrong target.

23:56.769 --> 24:00.148
As I said earlier, Madame,
I am not at liberty

24:00.273 --> 24:03.025
to comment on that
any further than I already have.

24:03.151 --> 24:07.989
Then France proposes tabling
any discussion of the U.S. initiative

24:08.114 --> 24:12.326
until the president <i>can</i> say more
and does.

24:15.121 --> 24:16.456
All I can do...

24:17.707 --> 24:22.170
is ask you all, please...

24:22.295 --> 24:26.048
please do not allow
my nation's domestic issues

24:26.174 --> 24:28.134
to interfere with our global objectives.

24:29.051 --> 24:31.179
Then I move to have
the Nuclear Planning Group

24:31.304 --> 24:33.014
revisit the initiative this afternoon.

24:33.139 --> 24:36.767
The Nuclear Planning Group will meet
after the morning session to...

24:36.893 --> 24:39.520
- reconsider.
- Thank you.

24:41.022 --> 24:45.318
Now let's move to some of the less...
controversial items on our agenda.

24:50.573 --> 24:52.492
The trace has been planted.

24:53.910 --> 24:57.705
If someone deletes these digital files,
we'll be able to track the bastard.

25:00.374 --> 25:02.084
Don't thank me all at once.

25:05.505 --> 25:07.381
- All right, all right.
- Way to go, Abe!

25:07.507 --> 25:11.886
Thank you. Thank you very much.
Thank you. Go back to work. Enough.

25:12.011 --> 25:13.721
All right, thank you.

25:14.263 --> 25:16.390
All right.
Thank you very much. Thank you.

25:16.516 --> 25:17.475
Good job. Great job.

25:17.600 --> 25:18.976
You didn't get my texts?

25:19.101 --> 25:21.312
Well, I've been busy making us famous.

25:21.437 --> 25:22.897
Come in.

25:23.022 --> 25:25.942
Abe Leonard, Alyssa Abboud.

25:26.567 --> 25:29.153
Uh, are we here to discuss
promotional opportunities?

25:29.278 --> 25:31.489
Actually, Alyssa's from Legal.

25:31.614 --> 25:34.534
- Oh.
- The FBI wants to talk to you.

25:38.788 --> 25:42.500
That's so predictable.
I just didn't expect it this soon.

25:42.625 --> 25:43.501
Abe...

25:43.626 --> 25:45.419
For weeks, I couldn't get them
on the phone.

25:45.545 --> 25:47.421
They even put a tail on me
to try and scare me off.

25:47.547 --> 25:49.006
What? <i>Now</i> they want to talk?

25:49.131 --> 25:51.008
I mean, forget it.
I'm not talking to them.

25:51.133 --> 25:53.928
- We'd like you to.
- I'm sorry. What?

25:54.053 --> 25:55.846
They believe that you could be
a potential witness

25:55.972 --> 25:57.515
in their investigation
into the Capitol bombing.

25:57.640 --> 26:01.435
- No way. I'm not giving up my sources!
- No one's asking you to.

26:01.561 --> 26:05.022
- So what are you asking me?
- To go in for an interview. That's all.

26:05.147 --> 26:06.983
- See what they want.
- Why should I?

26:07.108 --> 26:08.651
Because they can subpoena you
if you don't.

26:08.776 --> 26:09.777
Fine. Let 'em.

26:09.902 --> 26:12.113
What Alyssa's saying is
if you go in voluntarily,

26:12.238 --> 26:14.365
it buys good will,
for you and the paper,

26:14.490 --> 26:17.451
the paper that gave you the time and
money and support to get this story.

26:17.577 --> 26:20.288
Yeah, and possibly pick up
another Pulitzer for their troubles.

26:23.249 --> 26:27.169
I'm asking you, Abe.
This is what New York wants.

26:28.421 --> 26:29.922
It's important to me.

26:39.307 --> 26:40.349
Okay.

26:41.809 --> 26:43.185
Well, I guess it's a date.

26:43.311 --> 26:46.355
We'll leave together from here.
One hour.

26:50.359 --> 26:52.069
What's her problem?

26:52.194 --> 26:53.988
She represents journalists.

26:58.034 --> 27:00.161
Hey. You never told me
about <i>Air Force One.</i>

27:00.286 --> 27:02.913
I can't believe you're asking me
about that on a day like this.

27:03.039 --> 27:04.081
I want to know how it went.

27:04.206 --> 27:08.044
- I'm really crazy-busy right now, Emily.
- Everyone is crazy-busy right now, Seth.

27:08.169 --> 27:10.713
Really quickly, just tell me,
was it everything you'd hoped it'd be?

27:10.838 --> 27:15.009
Uh, let's just say that the anticipation
far outweighed the actual event.

27:15.134 --> 27:17.053
Mm. So I heard.

27:20.222 --> 27:22.516
What do you mean? Moss told you?

27:22.642 --> 27:24.518
He may have sent me a photo.

27:26.228 --> 27:28.064
We are no longer friends.

27:35.863 --> 27:38.074
Fernandez? Agent Foerstel.

27:38.658 --> 27:40.117
- Nice to meet you.
- Status update.

27:40.242 --> 27:42.912
We've covered this entire area.
So far, nothing.

27:43.496 --> 27:44.622
It's unacceptable.

27:44.747 --> 27:46.457
The ship must have disabled
its transponder.

27:46.582 --> 27:49.794
You add in rough seas and a low ceiling,
it makes the search twice as difficult.

27:49.919 --> 27:52.213
I need you to put
every resource you have on this.

27:52.338 --> 27:55.383
It's already being done, sir.
But, in my experience,

27:55.508 --> 27:57.885
it's hard to find a ship
that doesn't want to be found.

27:58.010 --> 27:59.887
I don't care. Find it.

28:08.896 --> 28:10.898
Come in.

28:11.440 --> 28:13.776
It's the readout we drafted
for the afternoon session,

28:13.901 --> 28:16.570
minus the U.S. initiative.
It's just standard boilerplate.

28:16.696 --> 28:19.115
If you're good with it,
I'll get it out to the pool.

28:20.783 --> 28:22.410
This is fine. Send it out.

28:22.535 --> 28:24.537
- Thank you.
- Seth...

28:26.872 --> 28:28.499
Thank you for what you did
this afternoon.

28:28.624 --> 28:30.501
Oh, you mean
dying on the world stage?

28:30.626 --> 28:32.420
Yeah.

28:34.797 --> 28:37.675
- Pretty awful, wasn't it?
- Well, look, I'll be honest.

28:37.800 --> 28:40.928
It was one of my more colorful briefings.

28:41.053 --> 28:43.681
But your job is way harder than mine,
especially right now.

28:43.806 --> 28:46.350
I appreciate you saying that.

28:46.475 --> 28:48.936
And I appreciate
you not asking for more information.

28:49.061 --> 28:50.688
Well, I've known you
for a while now, sir.

28:50.813 --> 28:53.357
Long enough to know that, uh,
when you make a decision,

28:53.482 --> 28:55.860
it's for a good reason,
and that's good enough for me.

28:55.985 --> 28:57.862
Just wish it was good enough
for the press.

28:57.987 --> 29:00.030
Yeah.

29:00.156 --> 29:01.824
Excuse me. This might be important.

29:01.949 --> 29:03.075
Seth Wright.

29:05.161 --> 29:06.287
Thank you.

29:08.789 --> 29:10.207
The Nuclear Planning Group voted.

29:10.332 --> 29:12.668
They're not gonna be putting
your initiative back on the agenda.

29:12.793 --> 29:14.587
So that's it then.

29:17.673 --> 29:19.800
Sir, the First Lady's
on the phone for you.

29:19.925 --> 29:21.594
Thank you.

29:22.303 --> 29:24.597
- I'm sorry, sir.
- Next time.

29:32.354 --> 29:33.355
Alex.

29:33.481 --> 29:34.899
Hey.

29:35.024 --> 29:36.400
<i>Everything all right?</i>

29:36.525 --> 29:38.778
We're fine. How are <i>you?</i>

29:40.780 --> 29:42.531
I've been better.

29:42.656 --> 29:46.368
I'm sorry.
I know this can't be easy.

29:48.037 --> 29:49.205
No.

29:53.876 --> 29:57.213
So, I've... I've been
thinking about you all day.

29:57.546 --> 29:59.423
You know, the story.

29:59.548 --> 30:02.218
I-I think I understand.

30:03.010 --> 30:04.428
Understand what?

30:04.553 --> 30:09.517
You shutting me out at the hospital
when that FBI agent came to see you,

30:09.642 --> 30:11.936
<i>the way you react every time</i>

30:12.061 --> 30:13.813
Mike enters a room...

30:14.563 --> 30:17.107
The reason you can't let the family

30:17.233 --> 30:18.901
<i>come back to the White House.</i>

30:19.401 --> 30:21.278
It's true, isn't it?

30:21.403 --> 30:25.241
Someone else blew up the Capitol,
and you don't know who it is, do you?

30:26.408 --> 30:27.535
Tom?

30:28.577 --> 30:31.413
There are so many things
I've wanted to tell you.

30:31.914 --> 30:33.958
<i>So many things I still want to tell you.</i>

30:34.083 --> 30:35.751
But you can't.

30:38.087 --> 30:41.423
I was thinking, a year ago...

30:43.050 --> 30:45.427
...the only thing I ever had
to worry about on a weekday

30:45.553 --> 30:48.472
was whether or not I'd get
to Penny's soccer practice on time.

30:48.597 --> 30:51.058
That is a lifetime ago.

30:51.684 --> 30:53.102
Yeah.

30:55.855 --> 30:58.691
Tom, how can I help you?

31:02.945 --> 31:04.780
Don't lose faith in me.

31:05.447 --> 31:06.866
Come on.

31:07.616 --> 31:10.119
I'm always on your side, right?

31:14.748 --> 31:16.959
Okay? Got it. Thanks.

31:17.877 --> 31:19.670
- I think we found 'em.
- Where?

31:19.795 --> 31:21.171
Port of Baltimore.

31:21.297 --> 31:23.424
They just received a call
from an unscheduled freighter

31:23.549 --> 31:25.509
looking to unload cargo.
Location works out.

31:25.634 --> 31:28.554
- When it's estimated to arrive?
- Less than an hour. Slip 216.

31:29.305 --> 31:33.350
Yes. Foerstel. I need an HRT en route
to the Port of Baltimore, Slip 216.

31:33.475 --> 31:34.768
I'm gonna meet them there.

31:36.979 --> 31:40.441
Mr. Leonard, thank you for coming in.

31:40.566 --> 31:42.026
My pleasure.

31:42.151 --> 31:43.485
Should we get started?

31:44.320 --> 31:45.905
Do I have to answer that?

31:50.326 --> 31:53.203
- You don't agree.
- That's not what I'm saying.

31:53.329 --> 31:56.540
- But you don't think it'll work.
- What I think doesn't matter right now.

31:56.665 --> 32:00.336
It's what the president thinks.
And I support the president.

32:01.670 --> 32:04.882
Now, Prime Minister Massett
has agreed to give you five minutes.

32:05.007 --> 32:06.842
So...

32:08.177 --> 32:09.929
Make 'em count.

32:11.513 --> 32:13.140
See you in five minutes.

32:14.850 --> 32:16.143
Thank you.

32:17.186 --> 32:18.938
Thank you, Madame, for seeing me.

32:20.522 --> 32:24.735
You understand why we took
the initiative off of the agenda.

32:24.860 --> 32:28.948
I did not agree with it,
but, yes, I understand.

32:29.531 --> 32:34.036
- I need to earn your trust.
- Oh, not just me. All of NATO.

32:34.161 --> 32:37.998
Fine.
But I would like to start with France.

32:38.123 --> 32:40.834
We began this dream
of weapons reduction together.

32:40.960 --> 32:43.170
And I will need you there to finish it.

32:43.963 --> 32:46.090
And how do you expect to do that?

32:46.215 --> 32:48.676
By proving to you
that the United States is serious

32:48.801 --> 32:50.052
about reducing the nuclear threat.

32:52.388 --> 32:56.016
My country has 200 missiles
in bunkers scattered across Europe.

32:56.141 --> 32:58.060
Russia has twice that number.

32:58.185 --> 33:00.354
The old dogmas of mutually
assured destruction

33:00.479 --> 33:04.775
versus secondary strike capabilities
need to be seriously re-examined,

33:04.900 --> 33:07.569
especially given the threat
of our control systems being hacked.

33:07.695 --> 33:10.197
- It's a terrifying thought.
- Yes, it is.

33:10.572 --> 33:12.116
And the more weapons that are out there,

33:12.241 --> 33:14.618
the greater chance
something could go wrong.

33:14.743 --> 33:16.954
For me, it is very simple.

33:17.079 --> 33:20.416
What kind of a world
do we want to leave our children?

33:26.255 --> 33:28.298
You are a dreamer, sir.

33:28.424 --> 33:30.092
Yes.

33:30.217 --> 33:31.593
Yes, I am.

33:32.344 --> 33:34.179
And I won't apologize for that.

33:36.098 --> 33:39.768
I have asked Secretary Moss to begin
bilateral negotiations with Russia

33:39.893 --> 33:42.229
in the hopes that you will join us soon.

33:43.689 --> 33:45.232
Madame...

33:46.066 --> 33:48.027
I do hope you join us.

33:48.444 --> 33:51.196
Because I believe wherever France goes,
NATO will follow.

33:55.117 --> 33:59.038
I hope we can discuss this
more fully at the next summit.

34:04.460 --> 34:06.253
I would like nothing more.

34:38.077 --> 34:38.994
<i>Ritter.</i>

34:39.119 --> 34:41.038
We got the son of a bitch.

34:41.163 --> 34:42.748
Where is he?

34:46.335 --> 34:47.460
The West Wing.

35:00.682 --> 35:03.227
Okay, our guy's on the move.
Go straight and take a right.

35:05.187 --> 35:07.189
<i>- Yeah. Keep going.</i>
- How much farther?

35:07.314 --> 35:09.024
<i>Take a left at the end of the hallway.</i>

35:10.484 --> 35:12.820
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Actually take a right.

35:12.945 --> 35:14.822
<i>Um...</i>

35:14.947 --> 35:17.658
No. Wait.

35:17.783 --> 35:19.243
Where am I going, Chuck?

35:19.368 --> 35:21.078
<i>No, no, no, no.
Come on. Come on.</i>

35:21.203 --> 35:22.329
What happened?

35:27.459 --> 35:28.961
Our guy.

35:31.880 --> 35:33.549
He cloned his digital fingerprint.

36:02.411 --> 36:04.746
- Hey.
- Hey.

36:05.414 --> 36:07.124
Poor guy.

36:07.249 --> 36:11.253
- Not quite the trip he expected.
- Not quite the trip <i>anyone</i> expected.

36:11.753 --> 36:14.464
- True enough.
- Thank you.

36:14.590 --> 36:16.884
- What for?
- For standing by me.

36:18.177 --> 36:20.387
Well... you didn't give me
much choice.

36:20.512 --> 36:22.639
If you go down,
I go down with you.

36:22.764 --> 36:25.392
- I'm being serious.
- Well, I am, too.

36:26.101 --> 36:27.769
You know, you drive me nuts, Tom.

36:28.395 --> 36:30.814
You're just so damn...
academic at times,

36:30.939 --> 36:32.858
I want to slap you upside the head.

36:35.027 --> 36:38.030
But damn if I don't see
something special in you,

36:38.780 --> 36:43.118
something that might...
well, might even approach greatness...

36:45.412 --> 36:47.039
...if you don't trip over your own feet.

36:47.789 --> 36:50.209
Thank you. I think.

36:51.877 --> 36:54.796
But we're not out of the woods yet.
Not by a long shot.

36:55.464 --> 36:58.634
You may have salvaged some credibility
with NATO for the time being,

36:58.759 --> 37:03.180
but we're gonna have a whole new
firestorm waiting for us when we land.

37:03.305 --> 37:04.765
I know.

37:05.265 --> 37:06.475
You ready for it?

37:08.477 --> 37:09.978
I'm gonna have to be.

37:18.403 --> 37:20.697
<i>President Kirkman
returns this afternoon</i>

37:20.822 --> 37:24.952
<i>to a very different political landscape
than the one he left just yesterday.</i>

37:25.077 --> 37:26.787
<i>Abe Leonard's bombshell story,</i>

37:26.912 --> 37:29.039
<i>which asserts Al-Sakar
was not responsible</i>

37:29.164 --> 37:32.793
<i>for the attack at the Capitol,
sent shock waves through Washington,</i>

37:32.918 --> 37:35.379
<i>and it couldn't have come
at a worse time for the president,</i>

37:35.504 --> 37:38.298
<i>who's at the height
of his first international trip.</i>

37:38.423 --> 37:42.219
<i>Many are calling this the worst day
of Kirkman's young presidency.</i>

37:59.528 --> 38:01.196
Let's go! Let's go!

38:01.321 --> 38:02.739
- Let's go!
- Move up on my six.

38:02.864 --> 38:05.492
- Let's go.
- Follow 'em up. Go, go, go.

38:05.867 --> 38:06.994
Come on! Go.

38:07.119 --> 38:08.704
Here we go.

38:08.829 --> 38:11.373
- Freeze!
- FBI! See those hands!

38:12.541 --> 38:14.751
Go!

38:14.876 --> 38:16.211
- Nothing.
- Nothing, nothing.

38:17.296 --> 38:18.714
Hey, hey.

38:22.134 --> 38:23.093
Eyes open.

38:23.218 --> 38:24.886
FBI! Put your hands up!

38:25.012 --> 38:27.055
Don't move! Do it now! Now!

38:30.726 --> 38:31.601
Down!

38:31.727 --> 38:33.895
- Let's go.
- Take him downstairs.

38:34.021 --> 38:35.188
We're all clear, sir.

38:35.314 --> 38:37.774
I want every container
opened and searched.

38:37.899 --> 38:39.276
Wells is somewhere on board.
Find her.

38:39.401 --> 38:40.610
- Yes, sir.
- Let's go!

38:40.736 --> 38:42.029
Let's get them down there now.

38:42.404 --> 38:43.822
On the ground!

38:59.338 --> 39:00.672
This one's clear!

39:06.178 --> 39:07.429
All clear!

39:09.765 --> 39:10.974
All clear, sir.

39:11.099 --> 39:13.560
- Let's check the others.
- What about this one?

39:15.354 --> 39:16.438
It's welded shut, sir.

39:16.563 --> 39:17.773
Well, blow it.

39:25.113 --> 39:26.948
Yeah, we're set here.

39:36.541 --> 39:37.459
Here we go.

39:41.546 --> 39:42.464
We're all set here.

39:45.258 --> 39:46.718
Let's go! Fire in the hole! Cover!

39:50.972 --> 39:51.973
- Go.
- Door's open.

40:17.332 --> 40:19.292
Hey, hey!
On the ground right now!

40:19.418 --> 40:20.877
Get your hands behind your head!

40:21.002 --> 40:23.004
- Get on your knees!
- Get down! Now!
