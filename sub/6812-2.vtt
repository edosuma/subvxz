WEBVTT

00:01.760 --> 00:03.990
We'll outsmart him.
Every step,
we'll outsmart him.

00:04.070 --> 00:07.130
We only got
two, three hours head start.

00:07.200 --> 00:08.531
They'll probably
figure we're gonna

00:08.600 --> 00:10.636
take him over
to Fort Huachuca.

00:10.710 --> 00:12.507
They don't make movies
like this anymore.

00:12.580 --> 00:14.730
That's a good thing.
All they do is talk.

00:16.650 --> 00:19.813
That was quick. Go ahead.

00:25.320 --> 00:26.685
Alex, will you let me finish?

00:45.510 --> 00:48.172
There she is.
Carrie Wells.

00:48.940 --> 00:50.100
You got my stuff, Zeke?

00:51.510 --> 00:53.068
You're not a cop,
are you, Red?

00:56.890 --> 00:58.812
I always wanted
to use that on you.

00:58.890 --> 01:00.653
July 11th,
June 19th, October 3lst,

01:00.720 --> 01:02.688
all three times
you used It on me,

01:02.760 --> 01:04.728
all _three times
you said you'd always
wanted to use it on me.

01:04.790 --> 01:06.291
That's weird.

01:06.360 --> 01:07.395
It's all there.

01:09.300 --> 01:10.858
Really?
Feels a little light to me.

01:10.930 --> 01:13.398
I won on Texas,
I won on BYU,

01:13.470 --> 01:15.062
and I won on San Diego State.

01:15.140 --> 01:17.404
Oh, look at that. I'm short.
Hand it over.

01:20.910 --> 01:23.049
Green Bay and
the over tonight.

01:26.180 --> 01:29.149
Sure. Speaking of tonight,
you free?

01:29.220 --> 01:31.347
I got tickets to this show
in town from Mexico,
a woman...

01:31.420 --> 01:33.684
Okay, stop.
Why is it that
every time I come

01:33.760 --> 01:35.182
to place
a respectable illegal bet,

01:35.260 --> 01:36.818
you ask me out
on some disgusting date?

01:36.890 --> 01:38.152
I've never asked
you out before.

01:38.230 --> 01:41.654
February 14th,
Valentine's Day,
no less, 2011.

01:41.730 --> 01:43.698
You asked me to join you
to watch your cousin

01:43.770 --> 01:46.261
strip on amateur night
at the Kinlq Kitty-Cat Club.

01:46.340 --> 01:48.262
You missed out.
Just the fact that

01:48.340 --> 01:49.762
you remember
all those things

01:49.840 --> 01:51.205
tells _me that
you're Interested.

01:51.270 --> 01:53.272
You know what it tells me?

01:53.340 --> 01:55.479
That you're a pig
and I'm a super cop
who remembers everything.

01:55.540 --> 01:58.338
Come with me tonight,
or I'll let everyone know

01:58.410 --> 02:02.210
that the super cop
is breaking the law
and making illegal bets.

02:03.420 --> 02:05.012
Are you blackmailing me, Zeke?

02:06.320 --> 02:08.459
How about I arrest your ass,

02:08.520 --> 02:11.353
throw you in jail,
and then it's your
word against mine?

02:14.430 --> 02:16.569
So you're taking Green Bay
in the over tonight, right?

02:16.630 --> 02:18.120
Yeah, exactly.

02:18.200 --> 02:19.736
You'll say yes someday,
Carrie Wells.

02:19.800 --> 02:21.165
Never gonna happen.

02:21.970 --> 02:23.164
Hey, Al.

02:27.310 --> 02:28.675
Sorry I'm late... Wow!

02:28.740 --> 02:31.607
Sporting a new tie,
I like it.
New?

02:31.680 --> 02:33.511
Just grabbed
whatever off the rack.

02:33.580 --> 02:35.571
Right.
I've been working with you
for four years,

02:35.650 --> 02:37.242
and you normally rotate

02:37.320 --> 02:39.015
the navy blue tie
with the burgundy spots,

02:39.090 --> 02:41.479
or the burgundy tie with
the navy blue spots.
That's a new tie.

02:41.560 --> 02:44.279
Just once,
I'd like to sneak
a new look by you.

02:44.360 --> 02:47.591
Okay,
here's what I'll tell you.
I like it. It suits you.

02:47.660 --> 02:50.527
Skinny, hip, edgy.
It's a good look for you.
Yeah?

02:50.600 --> 02:52.488
It doesn't have
anything to do with
that hot new detective

02:52.570 --> 02:54.367
that just
transferred in, does it?

02:54.440 --> 02:56.738
Oh, come on.
You think I'm
jealous of Denny?

02:59.310 --> 03:01.870
Two men shot. Both had guns.

03:01.940 --> 03:05.569
One was drawn.
Neither got a shot off.

03:05.650 --> 03:08.346
Looks like a professional hit.
Who are they?

03:08.420 --> 03:10.217
Don't know.
Neither man had ID.

03:10.290 --> 03:11.780
This room and
the adjoining suite
were booked

03:11.850 --> 03:15.013
by a dummy corporation
out of Delaware.

03:15.090 --> 03:18.821
The killer used a silencer,
so none of the guests
heard anything.

03:18.890 --> 03:22.269
Hotel employee
delivering bath salts
found the bodies.

03:22.330 --> 03:23.592
Where is the other suite?

03:23.670 --> 03:24.898
Back this way.

03:27.040 --> 03:29.861
Figure there was a woman
staying in this room.

03:29.940 --> 03:33.205
No telling if
she's a call girl
or a colleague of the victims.

03:34.680 --> 03:37.308
Nobody in the hotel
got a good look at her.

03:37.380 --> 03:39.917
What about
the surveillance video?
Can we ID her from that?

03:39.980 --> 03:42.073
Well, cameras have been down
for a couple of days.

03:42.150 --> 03:44.118
Head of hotel security
should be on his way.

03:44.190 --> 03:45.782
So, the question is,
did she orchestrate this

03:45.850 --> 03:47.158
or was she the target?

04:03.340 --> 04:05.808
Detectives, I'm Jerry.
Jerry Hayes.

04:05.870 --> 04:07.406
I saw your picture
down in the lobby.

04:07.480 --> 04:09.903
Employee of the month,
head of security,
very impressive.

04:09.980 --> 04:12.642
I'm sorry about the issue
with our cameras going out.

04:12.720 --> 04:14.870
We have been long overdue
for an upgrade.

04:14.950 --> 04:16.178
So you have nothing?

04:16.250 --> 04:18.718
One of my outside cameras
didn't go down.

04:18.790 --> 04:23.523
This was at around
the time of the incident.

04:23.590 --> 04:26.150
Well, you can't even tell
who is entering and
exiting the hotel there.

04:26.230 --> 04:27.993
JERRY: Sorry again.

04:28.060 --> 04:30.893
Surveillance system
has a number of issues.

04:35.340 --> 04:37.865
Just once,
I'd like to sneak
a new look by you.

04:41.910 --> 04:45.698
Wow, Jerry,
that is a nice watch.

04:46.750 --> 04:48.377
Much nicer than
the one you had in

04:48.450 --> 04:50.008
your "employee of
the month" photo.

04:50.090 --> 04:52.012
What is that, a Rolex?

04:52.090 --> 04:54.411
How much did that cost you?
Those things are expensive.

04:55.160 --> 04:56.320
This was a gift.

04:56.390 --> 04:57.880
Fancy.

04:57.960 --> 04:59.450
You want to know
something cool?

04:59.530 --> 05:02.522
My partner here,
he's a tech whiz.

05:02.600 --> 05:04.625
Right?
I... I am.

05:04.700 --> 05:06.292
He could look at
your surveillance stuff,

05:06.370 --> 05:07.632
and he could
tell you If someone

05:07.700 --> 05:09.463
had tampered
with it like that.

05:09.540 --> 05:12.600
You know what,
just let me access the, um,

05:12.680 --> 05:15.433
the mainframe,
and I'll let you know.

05:17.610 --> 05:19.248
Look, I thought
they were gonna have

05:19.310 --> 05:21.414
a bachelor party
for someone famous.

05:21.480 --> 05:24.483
I didn't think anyone
was gonna get hurt, I swear.

05:24.550 --> 05:27.485
So you turned off
the cameras.
Who paid you, Jerry?

05:27.560 --> 05:31.951
I don't know.
All contact was
done electronically.

05:32.030 --> 05:34.225
I did leave the cameras on
in the stairwell.

05:35.660 --> 05:37.992
This may be useful.

05:38.070 --> 05:39.264
There's our mystery woman.

05:41.770 --> 05:43.135
What's on that floor?

05:43.210 --> 05:44.700
Guest rooms and
the health club.

05:44.770 --> 05:46.909
She wouldn't have
gone on the street
in a bathrobe, right?

05:46.980 --> 05:50.245
I don't know,
maybe the locker room
at the health club?

05:50.310 --> 05:51.402
Worth a try.

05:51.480 --> 05:52.742
She could still
be in the building.

05:55.680 --> 05:59.241
Health club services,
hotel guests,
and local members.

05:59.320 --> 06:01.208
Unis are checking
membership cards.

06:01.290 --> 06:03.986
I already told you
my wallet was
taken from my locker.

06:04.960 --> 06:05.949
I see.

06:09.400 --> 06:10.924
AL: Figure there was a woman
staying in here.

06:11.000 --> 06:13.594
What about
the surveillance video?
Can we ID her from that?

06:14.800 --> 06:15.892
Thank you, Officer.

06:15.970 --> 06:16.959
You're welcome, ma'am.

06:19.880 --> 06:21.700
You missed a spot.

06:22.680 --> 06:24.170
NYPD, let's go.

06:31.990 --> 06:33.651
Makes sense why
you were trying

06:33.720 --> 06:35.358
to keep a low
profile at the hotel.

06:35.420 --> 06:39.891
You're famous. Rosie Webb,
Ponte Vedra Beach, Florida,

06:39.960 --> 06:43.828
star witness in the ongoing
Barry Madden trial.

06:43.900 --> 06:47.791
Says here you helped him bilk
_ billions from
Innocent Investors.

06:47.870 --> 06:49.030
Just 'cause I
work with the guy

06:49.100 --> 06:50.260
doesn't mean I
helped him steal.

06:50.970 --> 06:52.062
So you didn't?

06:52.140 --> 06:53.903
Uh, it's complicated.

06:53.980 --> 06:56.642
Complicated is two dead men
with guns in a hotel room

06:56.710 --> 06:58.439
while you got away
without a scratch.

06:58.510 --> 07:02.640
John and Alex
died protecting me,
and I'm sorry about that.

07:02.720 --> 07:03.982
What happened in that room?

07:04.050 --> 07:06.245
The guys were watching TV,

07:06.320 --> 07:09.881
and I was putting
on my avocado mask,
getting ready for my soak,

07:09.960 --> 07:14.124
and then, boom,
I heard this loud thud in
the next room, so I ran.

07:14.200 --> 07:16.725
Someone went to a lot trouble
to take you out.

07:16.800 --> 07:18.893
Any idea who'd want you dead?

07:18.970 --> 07:21.894
Barry embezzled
money from a lot of
powerful people,

07:21.970 --> 07:23.301
and I worked with him.

07:23.370 --> 07:25.964
So maybe someone
was out for revenge.

07:26.040 --> 07:30.101
Word is, your testimony
is gonna put Barry away.

07:30.180 --> 07:33.115
Maybe he wants
to keep you from talking.

07:33.180 --> 07:34.772
Barry wouldn't
do that to me.

07:35.450 --> 07:37.509
We had a bond.

07:39.560 --> 07:41.858
Do you want to bond with me,
Lieutenant?

07:41.920 --> 07:43.182
I like your tie.

07:44.890 --> 07:46.858
Sit tight. I'll be back.

07:49.970 --> 07:52.791
So, I think that lady's taken
a shine to you, boss.

07:52.870 --> 07:54.929
Sooner we figure out
which agency is
protecting her,

07:55.000 --> 07:57.036
the sooner she becomes
someone else's problem.

07:57.110 --> 07:59.066
What do you have?
All right.

07:59.140 --> 08:01.973
Our two dead guys are
Alex Soler and John Kim.

08:02.040 --> 08:05.339
Former military,
both of them employed by
Firestone Security.

08:05.410 --> 08:08.743
What's a private
security firm doing
protecting a federal witness?

08:08.820 --> 08:10.913
I don't know, but it's clear
why she's being protected,
right?

08:10.990 --> 08:13.458
I mean, Madden defrauded
his investors
out of $20 billion.

08:13.520 --> 08:15.488
It's a ton of cash.
Look into his investors.

08:15.560 --> 08:17.221
It's also a ton of motive.

08:17.290 --> 08:18.325
All right.

08:21.230 --> 08:23.198
Hey, Carrie.

08:23.270 --> 08:24.862
_Yes.
Listen.

08:24.930 --> 08:26.534
I have been all
over that footage

08:26.600 --> 08:28.966
from outside
the hotel and nothing.

08:29.040 --> 08:30.769
I mean, I bet you nearly
solved the case yourself.

08:30.840 --> 08:33.604
Not yet,
but you know, you'd be
smart to put your money on me.

08:33.680 --> 08:35.079
Hey, it's kind of like
that murder you solved

08:35.140 --> 08:36.778
with the maid in
the hotel room.
Wow.

08:36.850 --> 08:39.375
Have you read
every single case
I ever worked on?

08:39.450 --> 08:42.112
Yeah. Oh, I'm sorry,
that's a little creepy.

08:42.180 --> 08:43.283
Well...
Okay.

08:43.350 --> 08:44.681
No, yeah, a little.

08:44.750 --> 08:45.978
I'm very enthusiastic,
you know?

08:46.050 --> 08:48.109
You are enthusiastic,
and it's endearing.

08:48.190 --> 08:50.920
Anyways, you know, I'm sure
you will solve this one, too.

08:50.990 --> 08:54.221
I'm sure we will, Denny,
when you get back to work.

08:54.300 --> 08:55.858
What?
Work.

08:55.930 --> 08:57.568
Yeah, right, sorry, okay.

08:57.630 --> 08:59.518
Bye, Denny.
Hey, boss.

09:00.500 --> 09:01.660
Guys...
Hmm.

09:01.740 --> 09:04.903
It turns out Rosie belongs
to the US Marshals Service.

09:04.970 --> 09:06.801
They outsourced
her protection

09:06.880 --> 09:08.336
since they feared
they had a mole in
their department.

09:08.410 --> 09:10.298
Why is she up here, anyway?
Trial's in Miami.

09:10.380 --> 09:11.574
They had to keep
her out of sight.

09:11.650 --> 09:13.675
The whole Madden case
rests on her testimony.

09:13.750 --> 09:15.809
Well, now she's their problem.
They can come and get her.

09:15.880 --> 09:17.541
Mmm.

09:17.620 --> 09:19.884
Actually,
the Marshals _Service
IS requesting

09:19.960 --> 09:22.087
that Major Crimes
take over her protection

09:22.160 --> 09:24.481
and deliver her to court
by Monday morning.

09:24.560 --> 09:26.152
We can't just
leave in the middle

09:26.230 --> 09:28.323
of a double
homicide investigation.

09:28.400 --> 09:32.632
I guess they'll have to find
another way to
get Rosie to Miami.

09:33.640 --> 09:35.460
Miami.
Miami.

09:35.540 --> 09:36.802
See? Here we go.

09:36.870 --> 09:39.009
Okay, I think it
is entirely possible

09:39.070 --> 09:43.769
that our killer followed
Rosie from the great
state of Florida.

09:43.850 --> 09:45.772
Would be prudent
to investigate down there.

09:45.850 --> 09:48.774
It's our duty
to hop on a short
flight to Miami,

09:48.850 --> 09:50.112
drop Rosie off,
find the killer,

09:50.190 --> 09:51.316
and spend a day
at the beach.

09:51.390 --> 09:53.017
Two days, tops.
CARRIE: Three maybe.

09:53.090 --> 09:55.251
You know,
just a simple
yes would suffice.

09:55.320 --> 09:57.857
Yes, and we'll even have
a mojito for you.

09:57.930 --> 10:02.151
Please do,
and I have a gift for you.
CARRIE: Oh!

10:02.230 --> 10:05.358
A free Highway Hoagies.
You shouldn't have.

10:05.430 --> 10:07.637
I did not.
I got you my AAA card.

10:09.440 --> 10:11.965
What do I need
your AAA card for?

10:12.040 --> 10:14.406
Oh. You mean
I didn't mention that

10:14.480 --> 10:17.369
because of Rosie's recent
lap band surgery,
she can't fly,

10:17.450 --> 10:20.419
and you'll be driving
the 1,300 miles to Miami?

10:23.050 --> 10:24.312
Have fun.

10:25.890 --> 10:27.653
BOTH: Driving?

10:42.710 --> 10:43.859
Are we there yet?

10:43.940 --> 10:45.862
Yeah, Al, are we there yet?

10:45.940 --> 10:49.944
We are eight minutes
_closer than the last
time you guys asked.

10:50.010 --> 10:52.604
You guys wanna see
the scar from my lap band
incision again?

10:52.680 --> 10:55.069
Ew, no, put your shirt down.

10:55.150 --> 10:57.015
Let's just enjoy the view.

10:58.590 --> 11:01.388
I think you've been
enjoying the view, Burns.

11:01.460 --> 11:04.429
Oh, yeah. I see you
sneaking peeks back here.

11:04.490 --> 11:07.220
Is this guy an animal
or what?

11:07.300 --> 11:09.518
Yeah, Al, actually,
I've kind of noticed you

11:09.600 --> 11:11.295
checking her out
in the rear view.

11:16.240 --> 11:17.832
You're so pretty, Carrie.

11:17.910 --> 11:20.003
I mean, I'd kill
for pores like that.

11:20.080 --> 11:21.775
Can I get my
video game back again?

11:23.710 --> 11:25.905
If you promise to
stop talking. Okay?

11:28.650 --> 11:30.845
ROSIE: Come on!
Get up there! No!

11:32.650 --> 11:34.083
Hey, QUYS,
we gonna pull over soon?

11:34.160 --> 11:36.481
'Cause Doc says I gotta move
every couple hours

11:36.560 --> 11:38.084
or the fluid builds up,

11:38.160 --> 11:40.651
and that's when
the gastroesophageal
reflux kicks in.

11:40.730 --> 11:42.220
And you do not want
to smell it.

11:42.300 --> 11:43.562
No, we do not.

11:43.630 --> 11:46.167
So, Al, could you
please pull over?
ROSIE: Yes.

11:46.230 --> 11:48.164
Okay, roadside dining it is.

11:52.110 --> 11:53.600
You remember our
last road trIp?

11:53.680 --> 11:56.137
July 2002.

11:56.210 --> 11:58.644
Drove down to Virginia Beach
for the weekend

11:58.710 --> 12:00.041
and had a big blow-up

12:00.120 --> 12:02.839
'cause I forced you to eat
at that diner.

12:04.950 --> 12:06.247
AL: What are you doing
back there?

12:06.320 --> 12:07.582
Please be quiet.

12:08.690 --> 12:10.988
Liquid diet. Sorry, guys.

12:11.060 --> 12:12.550
Could you be quiet?

12:12.630 --> 12:14.188
Sorry, it's doc's orders,
but I'll keep it quiet.

12:14.260 --> 12:16.228
Okay, really... Okay.
It's doc's orders.

12:18.400 --> 12:20.061
Actually, that's...

12:21.200 --> 12:22.736
Actually... Okay!

12:24.010 --> 12:25.261
Okay. Geez.

12:25.340 --> 12:26.807
Actually,
that fight happened on the

12:26.880 --> 12:28.279
drive to Newport,
not Virginia Beach.

12:28.340 --> 12:30.501
November 24th, 2001,

12:30.580 --> 12:33.174
we listened to Miami
crush the Washington Huskies.

12:33.250 --> 12:37.186
It was raining,
and then we spent
the entire night making up.

12:37.250 --> 12:38.888
Big time. And those...
Did we?

12:38.950 --> 12:40.679
Oh, my God.

12:40.760 --> 12:43.786
You are one of
those memory people
who remembers everything!

12:43.860 --> 12:46.351
People, dates, places.

12:46.430 --> 12:48.318
Oh, my God,
I saw this on 60 Minutes.

12:48.400 --> 12:50.197
You know the lady
from Taxi has this?

12:50.270 --> 12:52.659
Oh, sister,
teach me your ways.

12:54.840 --> 12:56.330
Al, are we there yet?

13:03.480 --> 13:06.677
Oh, hey, what brings you
up to these parts, Delina?

13:06.750 --> 13:08.172
I got an autopsy
report for Carrie.

13:08.250 --> 13:09.615
Figured I'd walk
them up myself.

13:09.680 --> 13:12.012
Well, uh, Carrie and
A! are out of town.

13:12.090 --> 13:15.150
So, maybe you
just came to see me.

13:15.220 --> 13:16.653
DELINA: Maybe.

13:16.720 --> 13:18.756
Or maybe I was just getting
my cardio in for the day.

13:18.830 --> 13:23.460
Do you cardio?
What for? That's like
airbrushing a Rembrandt.

13:25.900 --> 13:27.834
Well, even
a Rembrandt needs upkeep.

13:28.900 --> 13:30.731
So, I'm going for
a long loop around

13:30.810 --> 13:32.937
Manhattan this weekend.
You run?

13:33.010 --> 13:34.705
I always do better
when someone's pacing me.

13:34.780 --> 13:36.998
Well, running leads to
serious knee problems, right?

13:37.080 --> 13:38.877
I mean, first the joints go
and then the tendons.

13:38.950 --> 13:40.747
And then before you know,
you got a full
knee replacement,

13:40.820 --> 13:43.141
and you're running around
the supermarket
with a scooter, so...

13:46.090 --> 13:49.457
Okay. I guess I'll just
leave this here then.

13:49.520 --> 13:50.748
Yeah.

13:50.830 --> 13:52.286
See you.
Okay.

13:56.530 --> 13:57.861
That was horrible.

13:57.930 --> 13:59.227
True. You choked.

13:59.300 --> 14:01.359
But, look, it happens
to the best of us, kid.

14:01.440 --> 14:03.305
Just go after Delina,
and ask her out, okay?

14:03.370 --> 14:04.598
She wants you, too.

14:04.670 --> 14:08.003
No, no, not after
that meltdown, I can't.

14:08.080 --> 14:10.469
Look,
you take her out for a drink.
It will be rewarding.

14:10.550 --> 14:11.949
You will thank me, bro.

14:12.010 --> 14:14.217
I will thank you both
when you get back to work.

14:14.280 --> 14:15.770
Oh! Yes, boss.

14:15.850 --> 14:18.819
So no one has more motive
to take Rosie out than Madden.

14:18.890 --> 14:21.757
But if he is behind it,
how is he communicating
with the world

14:21.820 --> 14:23.685
out of sight of
the prison guards
and the officials?

14:23.760 --> 14:25.227
Burner phone,
easy to smuggle inside.

14:25.290 --> 14:26.723
You like him
for the hotel job?

14:26.790 --> 14:28.758
I'm not sure.
But if he was behind it,

14:28.830 --> 14:30.969
he's possibly orchestrating
another attack on Rosie.

14:31.030 --> 14:33.794
Denny,
check every outgoing call
from Madden's prison.

14:33.870 --> 14:35.997
If he's using a burner,
I wanna know who
he's talking to.

14:36.070 --> 14:38.504
There's like
1,500 prisoners there.

14:38.570 --> 14:41.607
I mean, there's a lot
of outgoing calls, boss.

14:41.680 --> 14:43.147
It's gonna be tough.

14:43.210 --> 14:46.338
But rewarding.
You'll thank me, bro.

14:47.820 --> 14:49.173
Okay, what about that guy?

14:49.250 --> 14:51.411
No.
Uh...

14:51.490 --> 14:53.355
Oh, how about that lady
in the red hoodie?

14:53.420 --> 14:55.308
Okay, I told you,
I can't remember

14:55.390 --> 14:57.221
something I've
never seen before.

14:57.290 --> 14:58.655
How you two doing here?

14:58.730 --> 14:59.992
Carrie's an imposter.

15:00.060 --> 15:03.097
I asked her about him
and her and him,

15:03.170 --> 15:04.421
and she doesn't recognize
any of them.

15:04.500 --> 15:05.899
That is because
I've never seen...

15:05.970 --> 15:07.289
What about this?

15:07.370 --> 15:09.930
June 18th, 2009.

15:10.010 --> 15:11.159
What have you got for me?
AL: Don't do it.

15:11.240 --> 15:12.764
You give in,
she'll never stop.

15:12.840 --> 15:14.273
I'm not cracking.

15:14.340 --> 15:16.103
I'm not even
acknowledging her.
I stumped you, didn't I?

15:16.180 --> 15:17.499
It was a Tuesday.
It was a Thursday.

15:17.580 --> 15:20.469
And I know that 'cause
that's the day I found
my dog, Mojito,

15:20.550 --> 15:22.142
at the Biscayne Country Club.

15:22.220 --> 15:25.610
They have
the best mojitos there.
That's why I named him Mojito.

15:25.690 --> 15:27.817
Aanay, look, here he is.
Isn't he cute?

15:27.890 --> 15:29.357
Oh, that's... Yeah.

15:29.420 --> 15:30.853
Oh, booja, booja.

15:30.930 --> 15:32.283
And I found him on a Tuesday.

15:32.360 --> 15:33.691
It was a Thursday.

15:33.760 --> 15:35.921
It was a Tuesday,
memory girl.

15:36.000 --> 15:37.558
She's not so reliable,
is she, Burnsy?

15:37.630 --> 15:39.928
June 18th, 2009.
It was a Thursday.

15:40.000 --> 15:41.991
And NASA sent
a rocket to the Moon
to find water.

15:42.070 --> 15:44.061
The Orioles beat the Mets 5-4.

15:44.140 --> 15:46.973
And I saw Up in 3D
for the third time.

15:47.040 --> 15:48.576
It was a Thursday.

15:48.640 --> 15:50.801
That is so frigging cool.

15:50.880 --> 15:53.348
So, tell me,
every time you look at Burns,

15:53.420 --> 15:55.172
do you get flashbacks
of all the times

15:55.250 --> 15:57.514
you guys did the deed?

15:57.590 --> 15:59.615
Backa-chick-a-wow-wow!

15:59.690 --> 16:01.487
Too many times to count.
What?

16:01.560 --> 16:03.721
I knew it.
I knew you guys had history.

16:03.790 --> 16:05.451
What is wrong with you?

16:05.530 --> 16:08.988
We will delve
into that after I hit the can.

16:09.060 --> 16:11.824
Stomach ain't
what it used to be.
Literally.

16:24.710 --> 16:26.541
Why are you
encouraging her?

16:26.610 --> 16:29.113
Coming from the person
who just had to
show off her memory.

16:29.180 --> 16:31.182
You're throwing
fuel to the_ fire.
I was correcting her.

16:31.250 --> 16:33.059
You were showboating.

16:33.120 --> 16:36.157
You were showboating
about the two of
us being together.

16:36.220 --> 16:37.426
Can you blame me?

16:38.430 --> 16:40.921
No, not really.
Not really.

17:01.650 --> 17:03.311
If you're gonna try to run,

17:03.390 --> 17:05.517
at least give us
a challenge.

17:05.590 --> 17:07.581
I was just stepping out here
to get some air.
Uh-huh.

17:07.660 --> 17:09.912
We don't have
foliage like this
down in Florida.

17:09.990 --> 17:11.457
Just, stop talking.

17:11.530 --> 17:14.249
Rosie, why do you keep
trying to run from us

17:14.330 --> 17:16.389
when all we're trying to do
is protect you?

17:16.460 --> 17:18.997
You do realize
there are people
trying to kill you, right?

17:19.070 --> 17:21.595
Look, once I testify,
that's it, it's over.

17:21.670 --> 17:23.934
It's goodbye, Rosie,
hello witness protection.

17:24.010 --> 17:26.308
They won't even let me
bring Mojito with me.

17:31.350 --> 17:34.012
Well,
one of my outside cameras
didn't go down.

17:36.250 --> 17:37.239
Oh, shit.

17:40.620 --> 17:41.609
No!

17:43.560 --> 17:44.959
Cover me, Carrie!

17:50.700 --> 17:51.894
You remember those guys?

17:51.970 --> 17:53.130
I remembered their car.

18:00.840 --> 18:02.205
ROSIE: This is not good
for my stomach!

18:08.320 --> 18:10.641
Rosie,
we have to get to the car.
Okay, okay!

18:10.720 --> 18:12.017
Get up and run!
All right!

18:12.090 --> 18:13.250
I want you to run!

18:13.320 --> 18:15.515
I'm pretty sure
this isn't doctor recommended!

18:15.590 --> 18:16.989
Run!

18:19.130 --> 18:20.597
Let's go, let's go!

18:20.660 --> 18:22.321
Okay, get down.
Ditto.

18:29.500 --> 18:30.501
Holy shit!

18:40.650 --> 18:41.810
Go faster, Burns. Faster!

18:41.880 --> 18:43.347
Yeah, Al, faster. Come on.

18:43.420 --> 18:45.285
Calm down. We got those two.
They're not coming after us.

18:45.350 --> 18:47.011
Who the hell were they?
I don't know.

18:47.090 --> 18:49.513
But if the word's out,
we're sitting
ducks in this car.

18:49.590 --> 18:51.023
Oh, no!
What?

18:51.090 --> 18:53.627
You forgot my blender
in the restaurant, Carrie!

18:55.500 --> 18:56.956
Are you kidding me?

18:57.670 --> 18:58.921
Your blender?

19:00.700 --> 19:02.759
REPORTER: Authorities arrived
at the scene to find one dead

19:02.840 --> 19:03.966
and another injured,

19:04.040 --> 19:06.304
whom they've
taken into custody.

19:06.370 --> 19:07.598
No word on
the other shooter...

19:07.680 --> 19:10.240
Hey, boss man.

19:10.310 --> 19:13.006
Looks like Carrie and A!
are handling themselves well.

19:13.080 --> 19:16.243
You'll come to discover
that they give
better than they get.

19:16.320 --> 19:19.016
One of the attackers is dead,
the other one's in custody.

19:19.090 --> 19:20.512
How's it going
with that burner phone?

19:20.590 --> 19:23.354
I've tracked 70
inside Madden's prison,
so far.

19:23.430 --> 19:25.955
And I haven't
linked any one of them
to him yet, but I will.

19:26.030 --> 19:27.224
Let me know
the second you do.

19:27.300 --> 19:29.393
Carrie and Al _
cannot get slowed down again.

19:29.460 --> 19:32.327
The prosecutor says
the trial's had
delay after delay,

19:32.400 --> 19:35.130
and Madden's lawyers
have filed for a dismissal.

19:35.200 --> 19:37.805
Judge Grumann down there
has lost all patience,

19:37.870 --> 19:39.531
and he is going
to dismiss the case

19:39.610 --> 19:41.202
if Rosie doesn't
appear on time.

19:41.280 --> 19:43.134
So if Rosie is not there
by tomorrow morning...

19:43.210 --> 19:44.746
Madden's gonna walk.

19:47.550 --> 19:48.642
They'll get her there,
boss.

19:56.760 --> 19:58.489
(IN DISTINCT RADIO
CONVERSATIONS)

20:05.870 --> 20:07.064
FBI.

20:08.740 --> 20:10.401
I need to speak to this man.

20:23.620 --> 20:24.848
Where is Rosie Webb?

20:27.320 --> 20:28.878
I don't_ need to
say shit to you.

20:35.930 --> 20:37.363
What are you doing?

20:50.210 --> 20:51.347
Care for some more?

20:53.180 --> 20:54.545
Where is Rosie Webb?

20:57.790 --> 21:00.111
With two cops.

21:00.190 --> 21:01.851
A red-headed lady
and a dude.

21:03.560 --> 21:06.256
Driving a gray SUV
with New York plates.

21:06.330 --> 21:07.695
That's all I know, man.

21:08.730 --> 21:10.493
I believe you.

21:10.570 --> 21:12.663
Thank you for
your cooperation.

21:20.480 --> 21:22.038
ROSIE: I thought you were
supposed to be super cops.

21:22.110 --> 21:24.578
Why do you two bozos
have us out in the open here?

21:24.650 --> 21:26.049
Let's get to a police station
where we...

21:26.110 --> 21:28.044
You know what?
If you could fly
like a normal person,

21:28.120 --> 21:29.417
we'd be in Miami already.

21:29.480 --> 21:31.584
Flying will kill me.

21:31.650 --> 21:34.551
We need to get you to Miami
to testify.

21:34.620 --> 21:37.453
Which means we need a new car,
one that no one's
gonna recognize.

21:37.530 --> 21:39.350
A car we don't know
how to pay for, by the way.

21:39.430 --> 21:42.729
We'll be tracked if we use
our credit cards or an ATM.

21:42.800 --> 21:44.825
Well, we can steal one.
ROSIE: Come on.

21:44.900 --> 21:46.765
Problem is,
I know you're not joking.

21:48.040 --> 21:49.996
Wait a second.

21:50.070 --> 21:52.300
I got you my AAA card.

21:52.370 --> 21:55.339
CARRIE: What do I need
your AAA card for?

21:55.410 --> 21:58.106
Eliot is feeling
very generous today.

21:58.180 --> 22:00.375
I don't think I wanna know
what you're about to do.

22:00.450 --> 22:03.715
I saw his credit
card yesterday.
Platinum.

22:03.790 --> 22:05.143
Eliot's gonna buy us a car,

22:05.220 --> 22:07.211
and I don't even think
I'm gonna haggle on the price.

22:07.290 --> 22:08.450
Come on, Rosie.

22:09.860 --> 22:10.986
You killed me, Carrie.
Thanks a lot.

22:11.060 --> 22:12.527
I'm gonna give Jay a call.

22:12.590 --> 22:14.251
Hey, everything all right
with you guys?

22:14.330 --> 22:16.821
We're about to get
on the move again.
What have you found?

22:16.900 --> 22:18.891
So it looks like
the guys who attacked you

22:18.970 --> 22:20.221
are linked to
this drug dealing

22:20.300 --> 22:22.359
network operating
up and down I-95.

22:22.440 --> 22:24.135
Drug dealers attacked us?

22:24.210 --> 22:26.804
Not just any drug dealers, Al,
the Careyes Cartel.

22:26.870 --> 22:28.599
These are the guys responsible
for the massacre

22:28.680 --> 22:31.444
of all those
federales outside of
Mexico City last year.

22:31.510 --> 22:33.478
Was Madden
involved with the cartel?

22:33.550 --> 22:35.643
I don't know, but check this.

22:35.720 --> 22:37.381
Virginia State
Police recovered

22:37.450 --> 22:39.441
a .9 mm inside
the cartel guy's car.

22:39.520 --> 22:41.784
And you're gonna
say the ballistics
match the crime scene

22:41.860 --> 22:43.179
of Rosie's hotel room.

22:43.260 --> 22:45.820
They sure do.
They killed
Rosie's security guys.

22:46.460 --> 22:47.791
Great work, Jay.

22:47.860 --> 22:49.657
I'll touch base _
when we come up for air.

22:49.730 --> 22:50.719
All right.

22:54.170 --> 22:57.435
Whoo! Check it out.
Your chariot awaits.

22:58.970 --> 23:01.302
Never saw you
as the station wagon type.

23:01.380 --> 23:04.042
Yeah, well, according
to Car and Driver
September 2002 review,

23:04.110 --> 23:07.147
this car is safe, reliable,
and turbo-charged.

23:07.210 --> 23:08.916
So hop in, sexy.

23:10.520 --> 23:12.215
Oh, I called shotgun.

23:12.290 --> 23:13.985
No, you get
shotgun when you tell me

23:14.060 --> 23:16.051
why a Mexican cartel
is trying to kill you.

23:17.430 --> 23:18.556
Get in the back.

23:25.470 --> 23:28.132
Look, boss, it took a while,
but I finally found a burner
in the prison

23:28.200 --> 23:29.565
that received
a call two days ago

23:29.640 --> 23:30.902
from that hotel
room in Manhattan.

23:30.970 --> 23:32.335
Rosie called Madden?

23:32.410 --> 23:34.378
God, yes,
like dozens of times
over the last month.

23:34.440 --> 23:36.738
She is leaving
a trail of breadcrumbs
for people to find.

23:36.810 --> 23:39.847
There is no leak
in the US Marshals.
Rosie is the leak.

23:39.910 --> 23:41.639
Who else did you
trace calls to?

23:41.720 --> 23:42.914
Well, that's another
interesting thing,
all right?

23:42.980 --> 23:45.016
A law firm in Beaumont,
Texas.

23:45.090 --> 23:47.081
But his legal team's
in Miami.

23:47.150 --> 23:49.084
No, the Texas
firm's rumored to be
one of those places

23:49.160 --> 23:51.526
fighting for, like, fixers
or cleaners or even hitmen.

23:51.590 --> 23:53.421
Wait a minute,
you said hitmen.

23:53.500 --> 23:55.923
I just got off
the phone with
the Virginia State Police.

23:56.000 --> 23:57.968
Gunman at the diner
was found dead in
an ambulance

23:58.030 --> 23:59.497
with a puncture
wound to his neck.

23:59.570 --> 24:01.367
He died of cardiac arrest.

24:01.440 --> 24:03.089
Now they think
the guy who did it
was posing as a cop.

24:03.170 --> 24:05.536
Maybe Madden hired a hitman
to take Rosie out.

24:05.610 --> 24:06.736
Jay, call Al.

24:06.810 --> 24:08.300
I can't.

24:08.380 --> 24:10.302
They powered off the phones
to keep from being tracked.

24:22.060 --> 24:25.484
No back door for
you to sneak out of.
Bath's all yours.

24:26.560 --> 24:28.699
Gross.
Did you see this tub?

24:28.760 --> 24:30.762
May I remind you
I am the star witness?

24:30.830 --> 24:32.866
And may we remind you
that some really bad guys

24:32.930 --> 24:34.295
shot at all of us today?

24:34.370 --> 24:36.759
Which raises the question
that you're not answering.

24:36.840 --> 24:40.401
Why is a Mexican drug cartel
after you?

24:40.470 --> 24:41.630
I should take my soak.

24:41.710 --> 24:43.337
Do you know
what you should do?

24:43.410 --> 24:46.049
You should talk to me now,
or you're not
gonna take a soak.

24:46.110 --> 24:49.113
You're not gonna get any food.
We're not gonna
even let you sleep.

24:51.390 --> 24:53.858
All right. The short version,

24:53.920 --> 24:56.218
Barry handled money
for this company in Dallas.

24:56.290 --> 24:58.781
Now, as his Chief
Financial Officer,

24:58.860 --> 25:01.499
I naturally did
my due diligence...

25:01.560 --> 25:02.822
This is the short version?

25:02.900 --> 25:04.993
...like I always
did and I found out

25:05.070 --> 25:07.322
this company was a front
for the Careyes Cartel.

25:07.400 --> 25:10.392
So, when I told Barry this,
he saw it as an opportunity

25:10.470 --> 25:13.166
to skim from
them since he knew
they couldn't go to the Feds.

25:13.240 --> 25:16.073
And now they're after
you because you're
Barry's right hand.

25:16.140 --> 25:17.505
Yeah, what a relief.

25:17.980 --> 25:19.174
Relief?

25:19.250 --> 25:21.115
Well, that means
Barry's not after me.

25:21.180 --> 25:22.841
See, I knew
he wouldn't betray me.
No, no, no.

25:22.920 --> 25:24.649
You and Madden had a thing.

25:25.650 --> 25:27.311
Mmm-mmm.

25:27.390 --> 25:29.085
Yes, you did.

25:29.160 --> 25:30.252
That's crazy.

25:30.320 --> 25:32.083
You don't wanna testify.

25:32.160 --> 25:33.457
Where's all the
money hidden?

25:33.530 --> 25:36.226
IfI knew, would I be
hanging out with you two?

25:36.300 --> 25:38.723
How much did Madden
skim from the cartel?

25:38.800 --> 25:40.427
$3.4 million.

25:40.500 --> 25:42.661
Oh!
But they had hundreds
of millions with us.

25:42.740 --> 25:46.039
So, you know,
who is gonna notice
a couple mil here or there?

25:46.110 --> 25:47.600
The cartel.
The cartel.

25:47.680 --> 25:49.272
That appears to be correct.

25:50.540 --> 25:52.178
Go and take a bath.

25:52.250 --> 25:53.945
Okay.
Okay.

25:54.020 --> 25:55.078
ROSIE: Fine.

25:55.150 --> 25:58.881
But I see you
eyeing Burns over here.

25:58.950 --> 26:01.748
Probably remembering
all the times you guys
did it in hotels.

26:03.320 --> 26:04.628
Hey, we are in Georgia.

26:04.690 --> 26:07.284
Maybe you guys can pretend
you're Rhett and Scarlett.

26:09.430 --> 26:11.864
Call if you guys want company.
Seriously.

26:13.070 --> 26:14.196
Hmm.

26:14.270 --> 26:15.339
Wow.

26:20.570 --> 26:23.004
AL: How many hotels
has it been?

26:23.080 --> 26:25.275
I bet I can
guess within three.

26:25.810 --> 26:27.209
Game on.

26:27.280 --> 26:30.272
AL: Let's see,
there's Puerto Rico,

26:30.350 --> 26:34.309
Jamaica,
Albany, Puerto Rico again.

26:34.390 --> 26:36.119
December 3lst, 2001,

26:36.190 --> 26:39.580
to January 3rd, 2002,

26:39.660 --> 26:43.869
and I was wearing, um,
not much.

26:45.330 --> 26:46.866
Boston?

26:46.930 --> 26:49.831
Nantucket?
We never went to Nantucket.

26:49.900 --> 26:51.936
That wasn't you?
Quit stalling.

26:52.010 --> 26:53.102
Come on!

26:53.170 --> 26:54.535
Nine hotels.

26:54.610 --> 26:56.498
It was actually eight.
You're off by one.

26:56.580 --> 26:58.901
All right, you missed one.
You didn't include this place.

27:00.550 --> 27:02.575
Maybe we should play
Rhett and Scarlett.

27:02.650 --> 27:06.211
Or maybe you should take
a cold shower in
there with Rosie.

27:06.290 --> 27:07.712
We're working.

27:07.790 --> 27:09.382
We're not on vacation
and we're not
domg any of that,

27:09.460 --> 27:10.722
and she's right
in the other room.

27:10.790 --> 27:13.452
"Frankly,
my dear, I don't give a..."

27:13.530 --> 27:15.725
Freeze! Drop your weapon!

27:27.510 --> 27:29.478
According to witnesses,

27:29.540 --> 27:33.601
you were
involved in a shooting
and fled the scene.

27:33.680 --> 27:36.069
I had no choice
but to detain you.

27:36.150 --> 27:37.686
Cops or not.

27:37.750 --> 27:40.344
Detaining us is one thing.
You kept us in
a cell all night.

27:40.420 --> 27:42.752
You've still got my partner
locked up in there.

27:42.820 --> 27:44.981
Got a smart mouth on her.

27:45.060 --> 27:47.824
I prefer handling
this between us.

27:47.900 --> 27:49.925
Look,
I explained it to you.

27:50.000 --> 27:51.627
We fled the diner

27:51.700 --> 27:54.134
because our presence
put civilians in
the line of fire.

27:54.200 --> 27:58.204
I hear you,
but I'm just
doing my job here.

27:58.270 --> 28:01.000
You separated us
_ from a federal
Witness in our custody!

28:01.080 --> 28:03.401
Don't worry,
she's in good hands.

28:06.050 --> 28:08.143
So I say,
"Put the stereo down or

28:08.220 --> 28:10.518
"I'm sending
50,000 volts into you."

28:10.580 --> 28:11.717
Aw, then what happened?

28:11.790 --> 28:12.916
He put that stereo down.

28:15.460 --> 28:18.554
Turned out he was
helping his brother
move, so.

28:19.590 --> 28:20.955
You cops are so brave.

28:22.900 --> 28:25.767
Hey, you know, I haven't had
anything to eat in ages.

28:25.830 --> 28:27.593
Do you think
you could find
something for me?

28:29.140 --> 28:30.835
My boss said to
keep an eye on you.

28:32.670 --> 28:35.173
Yeah, that's...
You know, I'm sure
the dizziness will pass.

28:37.380 --> 28:39.245
It's fine,
don't worry about it.

28:40.920 --> 28:42.547
Um...

28:42.620 --> 28:43.985
English muffin okay?

28:45.690 --> 28:47.317
Only if you get one
for yourself, too.

28:56.700 --> 28:58.520
Thank you, Chapman.

28:58.600 --> 28:59.828
Your partner's released now.

29:03.040 --> 29:04.462
Thank you.
Mmm-hmm.

29:06.040 --> 29:07.928
Um...

29:08.010 --> 29:12.709
We switched cars,
so how did you
track us to the motel?

29:12.780 --> 29:14.611
Someone sent _
an anonymous email.

29:14.680 --> 29:17.717
Virginia State
Police sent out a BOLO
for the blue Volvo,

29:17.790 --> 29:20.543
and my guy
saw the car in
front of your hotel.

29:20.620 --> 29:22.656
Here we are.

29:22.720 --> 29:24.927
Unless the car dealer
recognized us somehow,

29:24.990 --> 29:27.754
the only other person
who could have squealed is...

29:29.900 --> 29:30.889
Rosie.

29:33.570 --> 29:34.730
Where is she?

29:35.740 --> 29:37.093
Rosie was here a minute ago.

29:37.170 --> 29:38.535
You just let her walk?

29:38.610 --> 29:40.032
Nice work, Officer.

29:40.980 --> 29:42.675
Did you see where she went?

29:42.740 --> 29:45.709
She got in
a brown pickup truck
with some guy.

29:48.380 --> 29:50.473
Who the hell would Rosie know
around here?

30:07.840 --> 30:10.400
Rosie rigged her
video game to go on

30:10.470 --> 30:12.301
the Wi-Fi at
the car dealership.

30:12.370 --> 30:16.238
She was playing
with someone online.
WoodbineJenkins73.

30:16.310 --> 30:19.404
What if she asked
the other player
to come get her?

30:19.480 --> 30:22.574
Woodbine.
It's a town about
15 miles from here.

30:24.020 --> 30:25.339
I'll get Jay to
track him down.

30:25.420 --> 30:29.151
And we should hurry,
we're not the only ones
looking for her.

30:29.220 --> 30:31.984
Come on, come on, come on.
Got it!

30:32.060 --> 30:35.029
Guy Rosie's been chatting
with is Mike Van Loon
out of Woodbine.

30:35.100 --> 30:37.625
Got an address, too.
DENNY: This guy owns
a brown pickup?

30:37.700 --> 30:40.328
Uh... Sure does.

30:40.400 --> 30:42.937
Matches the description
that Al and Carrie gave us.

30:43.000 --> 30:44.865
Nice, Jay bone,
I'm gonna put a bulletin
out for the truck.

30:44.940 --> 30:46.259
Hey, hey,
hey, you get anything solid

30:46.340 --> 30:47.568
on that hitman we
think Madden hired?

30:47.640 --> 30:49.403
Not yet,
but I'm working on it.

30:49.480 --> 30:50.970
If he's been tailing
Al and Carrie this
whole time,

30:51.050 --> 30:52.574
then he probably knows
that they got
picked up, right?

30:52.650 --> 30:54.845
Yes, which means he's already
on Rosie's tail now, too.

30:54.920 --> 30:57.445
Which means Al and Carrie
are running out
of time, Denny.

31:21.010 --> 31:21.999
CARRIE: Clear.

31:25.710 --> 31:27.871
The plates match
the ones Jay called in.

31:27.950 --> 31:29.417
This is Van Loon's truck.

31:29.480 --> 31:32.415
So why is he pulled over
less than a mile from home?

31:32.490 --> 31:33.548
Where is she?

31:46.000 --> 31:47.865
Jay is calling it
in to the locals.

31:49.770 --> 31:51.306
Hasn't been dead long.

31:51.370 --> 31:52.928
Injection mark in his neck,

31:53.010 --> 31:55.331
same MO that was used
to kill the cartel guy.

31:55.410 --> 31:56.638
Madden's hitman.

31:56.710 --> 31:58.849
Why hire a killer
to kidnap Rosie?

31:58.910 --> 32:00.468
Madden's supposed
to have billions

32:00.550 --> 32:02.745
stashed away in
hidden bank accounts.

32:02.820 --> 32:05.789
What if Rosie
knows where they are,
but he doesn't?

32:05.850 --> 32:09.058
Madden needs Rosie
to get his money.

32:09.120 --> 32:10.849
Where do you hide
billions of dollars?

32:10.920 --> 32:13.229
Well, I mean,
you need to
hide bank accounts,

32:13.290 --> 32:15.099
passwords, routing codes,

32:15.160 --> 32:18.368
so if you're me,
in your memory

32:18.430 --> 32:20.762
or flash drive
or a notebook.

32:20.830 --> 32:21.967
I don't know, you could...

32:23.640 --> 32:24.766
Rosie's charm.

32:31.350 --> 32:32.339
Oh.

32:34.220 --> 32:36.074
Must have fallen
off in the struggle.

32:38.490 --> 32:40.185
'Cause that's the day
I found my dog, Mojito,

32:40.250 --> 32:42.252
at the Biscayne Country Club.

32:42.320 --> 32:43.856
Oh, boo-ja, boo-ja.

32:43.920 --> 32:45.228
Ah, that's... Yeah.

32:47.690 --> 32:49.555
_Rosie was obsessed
With my memory, right?

32:49.630 --> 32:51.325
And in the diner,
she kept going on

32:51.400 --> 32:53.027
and on and on
about that story,

32:53.100 --> 32:55.694
that story about
her dog, Mojito,

32:55.770 --> 32:57.567
and how she found him
at the country club,

32:57.640 --> 32:59.699
the Biscayne Country Club.

32:59.770 --> 33:02.307
What if she knew
I'd remember that,

33:02.380 --> 33:05.702
and she left
this to let us know
where they were taking her?

33:05.780 --> 33:07.543
I don't know.
Rosie's that smart?

33:07.610 --> 33:10.943
Uh, you can't judge
a book by its cover.

33:11.020 --> 33:13.079
It's a stretch,
but it's all we got.

33:24.370 --> 33:25.428
Members only, sir.

33:26.830 --> 33:28.536
Hi, Justin.
Oh...

33:28.600 --> 33:31.160
Hi, Miss Webb, didn't see you.
Go right ahead.

33:32.170 --> 33:33.398
Thank you, Justin.

33:55.860 --> 33:57.623
Hey!

33:57.700 --> 33:58.962
Always wanted to do that.

34:04.940 --> 34:06.703
Check outside.
I'll look back here.
Okay.

34:57.590 --> 35:00.787
AL: How many hotels
has it been? I bet I can
guess Within three.

35:09.840 --> 35:10.829
Gotcha!

36:32.420 --> 36:33.512
Drop it!

36:42.130 --> 36:43.449
You took your sweet time.

36:43.530 --> 36:46.499
Rosie was right.
The mojitos here are great.

36:50.240 --> 36:51.537
Well, look at that.

36:52.240 --> 36:53.707
The flash drive.

36:53.770 --> 36:56.477
And billions of dollars' worth
of missing bank accounts.

36:56.540 --> 36:57.529
Showboat.

36:58.880 --> 37:00.108
Who can blame me?

37:06.720 --> 37:08.779
What did I tell you
about running away from us?

37:08.860 --> 37:11.852
I just thought
that if I got my hands
on those bank accounts,

37:11.930 --> 37:15.821
that I could help
Barry and keep him
from dying in jail.

37:15.900 --> 37:17.458
But Barry sent
that killer after you

37:17.530 --> 37:20.067
so he could stay out of jail
and keep all the money.

37:20.130 --> 37:22.496
Yeah, I should have known
the guy was playing me.

37:22.570 --> 37:24.037
He plays everybody.

37:24.100 --> 37:26.261
Well,
I'm ready to testify now.

37:26.340 --> 37:28.399
You know,
I got your number.

37:28.480 --> 37:31.938
You act all _
crazy and neurotic.

37:32.010 --> 37:33.944
Crazy like a fox.

37:34.010 --> 37:36.877
Very impressed
that you left this,
knowing we would find you.

37:36.950 --> 37:40.545
My gosh, there it is.
Ah! Iwas looking
everywhere for this!

37:40.620 --> 37:42.053
Oh.

37:42.120 --> 37:43.587
Gotcha!

37:43.660 --> 37:46.322
I remembered that
you would remember.

37:46.390 --> 37:48.950
I showed you the way, sister!

37:50.130 --> 37:51.825
Oh, you owe me a blender,
though.

37:51.900 --> 37:53.765
I saved your life,
you're still going on
about the blender.

37:53.830 --> 37:55.991
What's the point
of saving my life
if I'm gonna starve to death?

37:56.070 --> 37:58.197
You're not gonna
starve to death.
Just buy a new blender.

37:58.270 --> 38:00.101
They're really
expensive and they're
really hard to find.

38:00.170 --> 38:02.229
They're not hard to find.
I just...
Everybody had a portable...

38:02.310 --> 38:07.247
Will you two knock it off?
Ladies? Ladies. Ladies.

38:07.310 --> 38:09.619
Eliot bought you
some more time,
but we're cutting it close.

38:09.680 --> 38:11.989
Florida Highway Patrol
Will take you
the rest of the way.

38:12.050 --> 38:13.779
Oh...

38:13.850 --> 38:15.056
Oh, this is goodbye.

38:16.020 --> 38:17.317
Yeah.

38:17.390 --> 38:20.780
Guys, bring it in.
Come here.

38:20.860 --> 38:23.897
Ah!
Thank you, guys,
so much for looking after me.

38:23.960 --> 38:26.292
No one's ever really done
that for me before.

38:28.600 --> 38:30.739
All right,
one more for the road.

38:30.800 --> 38:32.199
Um, okay.

38:32.270 --> 38:35.205
April 6th, 1983,
my sister's birthday.

38:35.280 --> 38:36.736
It was a Tuesday.

38:36.810 --> 38:38.573
I finally stumped her.
Gotcha.

38:38.650 --> 38:39.799
It was a Wednesday.

38:41.010 --> 38:42.216
Keep an eye on
this one, Burnsy.

38:44.890 --> 38:48.417
Hey, guys, how's it going?
What's your diet?
Do you eat healthy?

38:48.490 --> 38:50.117
You wanna see my scar
from the lap band surgery?

38:50.190 --> 38:52.351
You know,
I'm really gonna
miss her, maybe.

38:52.430 --> 38:54.079
I don't know.
She...

38:55.130 --> 38:56.222
Wow.

38:56.300 --> 38:59.189
So, back to New York?
Hmm.

38:59.270 --> 39:01.465
Yeah,
after we get a mojito.

39:01.540 --> 39:02.939
Or 10.

39:04.770 --> 39:06.635
Madden's going away
for the rest of his life.

39:06.710 --> 39:08.974
His victims are getting
a good chunk of
their money back.

39:09.040 --> 39:11.201
_I love me _
a fairy tale ending.

39:11.280 --> 39:12.577
We didn't order these.

39:12.650 --> 39:14.242
They're from a friend.

39:14.310 --> 39:15.641
Is Rosie here?

39:15.720 --> 39:17.847
No, there's only
one person I know

39:17.920 --> 39:20.388
Who still drinks
apple martinis.

39:20.450 --> 39:21.485
Hi, kids.

39:22.860 --> 39:24.680
Hello, Eliot.
AL: What are you doing here?

39:24.760 --> 39:26.489
Thought I'd surprise you.

39:26.560 --> 39:29.495
These cocktails
are for a job well done.

39:29.560 --> 39:32.859
Speaking of Which,
it appears that my work
on this case

39:32.930 --> 39:34.568
caught
the attention of the Feds,

39:34.640 --> 39:36.858
lots of praise,
lots of applause,
that kind of thing.

39:36.940 --> 39:38.362
Wow.

39:38.440 --> 39:41.409
You are still taking credit
for our hard work.

39:41.480 --> 39:44.699
It's very
comforting to me to know
that some things never change.

39:44.780 --> 39:47.772
Well, now, it seems that
some things do change.

39:47.850 --> 39:51.445
It appears they
appreciate my value
more than others.

39:51.520 --> 39:53.010
What's going on, Eliot?

39:53.090 --> 39:55.809
I'm saying
that because of
your hard work,

39:55.890 --> 39:58.051
I am getting a promotion

39:58.120 --> 40:00.088
to Miami-Dade Field Office
of the FBI.

40:01.460 --> 40:03.428
You don't wanna go work
With the Feds, right?

40:03.500 --> 40:06.321
I mean, we're way more fun.
There's no way
you're gonna accept that.

40:06.400 --> 40:09.597
Oh, I'm sorry,
but it's time for me
to move on up.

40:09.670 --> 40:11.604
So we have to
break in another boss?

40:11.670 --> 40:13.103
You were just
getting to the point

40:13.170 --> 40:15.229
Where you understood
that I am always right.

40:15.310 --> 40:16.709
Wow.

40:16.780 --> 40:20.375
I am touched by this
outpouring of sentiment,

40:20.450 --> 40:22.771
but honestly,
I would like
to raise a glass

40:22.850 --> 40:26.581
to the two finest detectives
I've ever worked With.

40:26.650 --> 40:30.108
You are_also
the two biggest
pains in the ass

40:30.190 --> 40:31.282
that I've ever worked With.

40:31.360 --> 40:33.783
Before we drink,
I wanna say something.

40:33.860 --> 40:36.727
To one of the smartest,

40:37.800 --> 40:38.789
weirdest,

40:40.800 --> 40:43.360
kindest people
I've worked With.

40:45.970 --> 40:47.506
I'll drink to that.

40:47.570 --> 40:49.037
Apple martinis
are so '905, Eliot.

40:49.110 --> 40:50.839
They're delicious.
AW!

40:50.910 --> 40:51.945
Agh!

40:52.010 --> 40:53.500
Hmm.

40:53.580 --> 40:55.673
I guess I have
a going-away present for you.

40:59.420 --> 41:00.842
I don't follow.

41:00.920 --> 41:03.059
Oh, you Will when you get
your next credit card bill.

41:09.800 --> 41:13.793
Al, you are a fine detective,
but you're a better man.

41:13.870 --> 41:15.030
Thank you.

41:15.100 --> 41:17.989
And how you put up with that
every single day,

41:18.070 --> 41:19.628
I'll just... I'll never know.

41:19.710 --> 41:24.545
And, Carrie, I Will deny this
if you ever repeat it.

41:25.680 --> 41:26.806
But you are the best.

41:27.710 --> 41:28.847
Don't forget me.

41:30.720 --> 41:33.211
Well, I couldn't forget you
even if I wanted to.

41:33.290 --> 41:34.780
But the good news is,
I don't.

41:37.720 --> 41:38.926
Drink up.

41:40.860 --> 41:43.420
He flew all the way to Miami
to tell us he's leaving.

41:45.270 --> 41:46.919
Al, I think
I'm gonna miss him.

41:47.500 --> 41:48.831
I know. Me, too.

41:51.540 --> 41:52.734
To Eliot.

41:53.570 --> 41:55.128
Yes.

41:55.210 --> 41:56.802
To Eliot.
For him.

41:56.880 --> 41:58.199
All right.
