WEBVTT

00:10.051 --> 00:12.470
- We're so so sorry.
- Thank you.

00:16.516 --> 00:19.477
Your socks are blue.

00:19.477 --> 00:21.229
- What?

00:21.229 --> 00:24.232
- Your suit is black,
the socks are blue.

00:24.232 --> 00:25.942
- Who cares?

00:25.942 --> 00:28.445
- People care.
It's disrespectful.

00:30.155 --> 00:32.032
- Mr. Poole,
I'm sorry about Jeff.

00:32.032 --> 00:33.700
- Thanks.

00:33.700 --> 00:35.577
- My condolences.
- Thank you.

00:35.577 --> 00:37.203
- Thanks.
- So sorry for your loss.

00:37.203 --> 00:38.329
- Thank you.

00:40.623 --> 00:43.084
- Who was that?

00:43.084 --> 00:44.377
- What do you mean,
"who was that?"

00:44.377 --> 00:48.173
They work for us
at the factory.

00:48.173 --> 00:50.175
You've seen them
every day for a year.

00:50.175 --> 00:52.427
- Oh, right.

00:52.427 --> 00:53.762
- Why aren't you
wearing a belt?

00:53.762 --> 00:55.388
- Shh, just--

00:55.388 --> 00:59.476
- Don't you shush your mother
at your brother's funeral.

00:59.476 --> 01:03.938
♪ Now,
now, now, now, now ♪

01:03.938 --> 01:06.900
- Today, we come
together in grief

01:06.900 --> 01:10.278
to mourn the passing
of Jeffrey Poole.

01:10.278 --> 01:13.156
- Michigan's about to lose
in the Big House,

01:13.156 --> 01:16.743
which means my parlay's
gonna pay off 240 fuckin' bucks.

01:16.743 --> 01:18.745
It's awesome, baby.

01:18.745 --> 01:21.164
- Seriously?

01:21.164 --> 01:23.708
Can you not be so happy at
your friend's brother's funeral?

01:23.708 --> 01:25.835
All right,
please put the phone away.

01:25.835 --> 01:28.254
- No one can tell, okay?
Look at me.

01:28.254 --> 01:30.507
Head down, hands folded,

01:30.507 --> 01:33.009
like I'm all sad
and praying and shit.

01:33.009 --> 01:35.678
- Three seconds, and that
phone's going in the grave.

01:35.678 --> 01:39.265
When we tragically lose
someone we've known and loved,

01:39.265 --> 01:42.268
we are reminded of
the frailty of life,

01:42.268 --> 01:46.397
and it becomes more clear
what is most precious.

01:46.397 --> 01:48.525
- Wonder when Ed's gonna
tell us how Jeff did it.

01:48.525 --> 01:50.693
- He's not.
And don't ask him.

01:50.693 --> 01:52.237
- Why can't I ask?

01:52.237 --> 01:54.823
- Because you don't ask a friend

01:54.823 --> 01:56.908
how a loved one
killed themselves.

01:56.908 --> 02:00.120
All right?
It's bad suicide etiquette.

02:00.120 --> 02:02.330
- Really?

02:02.330 --> 02:05.458
I feel like it's bad suicide
etiquette not to ask.

02:05.458 --> 02:08.711
Yeah, gives off the impression
you don't give a shit, you know?

02:08.711 --> 02:11.631
Like, "Hey, sorry about
your dead brother.

02:11.631 --> 02:14.217
Did you hear the McRib is back?"

02:14.217 --> 02:17.512
No, a caring person wants
to know details, you know?

02:17.512 --> 02:18.930
Like when you meet someone
in a wheelchair.

02:18.930 --> 02:20.390
You gotta ask.

02:23.935 --> 02:26.146
- Oh, shit.
Look who showed.

02:26.146 --> 02:28.898
- What?

02:28.898 --> 02:32.110
- Unreal.
- The balls on those two.

02:32.110 --> 02:34.863
After what they did to Eddie?

02:34.863 --> 02:37.991
- How can Jeffrey do this to me?

02:37.991 --> 02:40.577
Especially after your father.

02:40.577 --> 02:41.953
Thy rod and thy
staff, they comfort me...

02:41.953 --> 02:44.956
- Ed.

02:44.956 --> 02:49.252
Hey.
I'm so sorry for your loss.

02:49.252 --> 02:51.546
Yeah, man.

02:51.546 --> 02:53.882
If there's anything we can do...

02:56.467 --> 02:58.303
For the love of God!

03:01.222 --> 03:03.892
- Hey, man.

03:03.892 --> 03:06.769
Look, I don't know if it's cool
to say this or not, but...

03:06.769 --> 03:09.939
that was my all time
favorite funeral.

03:09.939 --> 03:11.816
- Thanks, Hal.
- Yeah.

03:11.816 --> 03:13.568
- It's definitely
not cool to say that.

03:13.568 --> 03:15.570
- I'm just saying,
Kyle had it coming,

03:15.570 --> 03:18.323
and Eddie fuckin' brung it.

03:18.323 --> 03:20.783
Also these éclairs are
fuckin' lights out.

03:20.783 --> 03:22.744
Do you know where
you guys got these?

03:22.744 --> 03:25.079
- Nah, I, uh, wasn't in charge
of the éclairs.

03:25.079 --> 03:26.956
- Okay, so you don't
know if they're like

03:26.956 --> 03:29.834
special funeral éclairs

03:29.834 --> 03:33.504
you can only get if, you know,
if someone dies, or...

03:33.504 --> 03:35.632
can you get them anytime?
That's all I wanna know.

03:35.632 --> 03:37.091
- What the fuck
is wrong with you?

03:37.091 --> 03:39.427
- What?
- Special "funeral éclairs"?

03:39.427 --> 03:42.347
- Hey, I don't know how
funeral food works, okay?

03:42.347 --> 03:44.515
- You're nuts.
- No, I'm not.

03:44.515 --> 03:47.185
- Hey--hey, Ed, uh,
Julie sends her love.

03:47.185 --> 03:50.104
She wanted to be here,
but the baby's sick, you know?

03:50.104 --> 03:53.107
- Yeah, no, tell her, uh--
tell her I appreciate that.

03:53.107 --> 03:56.069
- What happened to your neck?
Why's it all red?

03:56.069 --> 03:58.821
- Oh, uh.
You know, rash.

03:58.821 --> 04:00.323
- Sheesh.
- Yeah.

04:00.323 --> 04:01.741
- Ooh.
- Cheap cologne.

04:01.741 --> 04:03.117
Yeah.

04:03.117 --> 04:05.119
- Just a heads up,

04:05.119 --> 04:07.247
if you're going to spritz
your cock with cologne,

04:07.247 --> 04:09.165
you gotta cover up
that dick hole, bud.

04:09.165 --> 04:11.459
It can burn.
It can burn real bad.

04:11.459 --> 04:14.003
- It's a good tip.

04:14.003 --> 04:16.339
- Good tip.
See what you did.

04:16.339 --> 04:20.343
- Ed, your mother would like
to speak with you.

04:20.343 --> 04:25.848
- He survived
78 fucking months in prison,

04:25.848 --> 04:28.726
and the day he's released,
he fucking kills himself.

04:28.726 --> 04:31.938
It makes no fucking sense.

04:31.938 --> 04:33.815
- We don't know what
he went through.

04:33.815 --> 04:37.151
- You know, I wanted
to be there when he got out.

04:37.151 --> 04:40.071
I was going to be there to
hug him, and they said no,

04:40.071 --> 04:41.698
that's not what Jeffrey wanted.

04:41.698 --> 04:44.117
Just send him his
car, no visitors.

04:44.117 --> 04:45.994
Just give him some time
to clean himself up,

04:45.994 --> 04:49.163
and he'll come see us.
The fucking liar!

04:49.163 --> 04:51.124
- All right, Ma,

04:51.124 --> 04:53.459
just try not to be
so hard on him, all right?

04:53.459 --> 04:56.421
- When's the last time
you spoke to Jeffrey?

04:58.298 --> 05:00.049
- Well, I told you he
wouldn't talk to me.

05:00.049 --> 05:03.886
He only wrote.
- He wrote you letters?

05:03.886 --> 05:05.722
- Yeah, I told you that.

05:05.722 --> 05:07.557
- No you didn't.
When did you tell me that?

05:07.557 --> 05:09.183
- I-I don't know.
I thought I did.

05:09.183 --> 05:11.352
- You did not tell--
What did he fucking say?

05:11.352 --> 05:14.230
- Just, you know, small talk.

05:14.230 --> 05:17.650
Like, what he ate that day,
how much he exercised,

05:17.650 --> 05:20.945
like, you know,
general prison gossip.

05:20.945 --> 05:23.197
- I wanna see them.
- What, the letters?

05:23.197 --> 05:24.907
- Yes.

05:24.907 --> 05:26.075
- I don't have them.
I threw them away.

05:26.075 --> 05:27.744
- What?
That's bullshit.

05:27.744 --> 05:29.662
You never throw anything away.

05:29.662 --> 05:31.789
You save every--
You have my letters from camp,

05:31.789 --> 05:33.708
you have your
toenail clippings--

05:33.708 --> 05:36.210
- That was for one year,
and it was a joke.

05:36.210 --> 05:37.879
- What was the joke?

05:39.505 --> 05:41.299
- You wouldn't get it.

05:46.846 --> 05:49.015
Ed.

05:49.015 --> 05:52.894
Promise me
you're not gonna do anything.

05:52.894 --> 05:55.021
- Ma, don't do this.

05:55.021 --> 05:57.607
- Listen, I know that you're
still upset about Kendra,

05:57.607 --> 05:59.901
and that you would like
another trading job.

05:59.901 --> 06:01.527
- No, I would not like
another trading job.

06:01.527 --> 06:03.988
I can't get another trading job.

06:03.988 --> 06:07.200
- Ed, you are going
to have to promise me

06:07.200 --> 06:09.911
you are not going
to do anything.

06:11.496 --> 06:13.498
- Okay.
Yeah, I promise.

06:13.498 --> 06:14.957
Ma, I promise.

06:16.667 --> 06:20.004
So basically now, I'm stuck.

06:20.004 --> 06:22.090
- Stuck.
Stuck where?

06:22.090 --> 06:23.841
- Stuck living.

06:23.841 --> 06:26.761
I have no out.

06:26.761 --> 06:29.180
Even if I wanted to kill myself
at some point in the future,

06:29.180 --> 06:32.475
I can't, since my brother
already beat me to the punch.

06:32.475 --> 06:35.812
- So you think if you tried,
it'd be unoriginal?

06:35.812 --> 06:37.647
- No.

06:37.647 --> 06:40.400
No, it would completely
wreck my mom.

06:40.400 --> 06:42.819
Can you imagine what people
would say every time they saw
her?

06:42.819 --> 06:46.656
Be like, "There goes the lady
who drove her husband

06:46.656 --> 06:50.159
and both her sons to suicide.
What a shit show she must be."

06:50.159 --> 06:53.454
-
That wouldn't be funny.

06:53.454 --> 06:56.082
But let's be clear.
You're not suicidal, right?

06:58.793 --> 07:01.295
- Okay I'm--I'm...only
telling you this

07:01.295 --> 07:03.965
because it's kind
of a crazy story,

07:03.965 --> 07:07.427
but I, uh, I found out
my brother killed himself

07:07.427 --> 07:10.346
while I was in the middle
of trying to kill myself.

07:10.346 --> 07:13.015
What are the odds?

07:13.015 --> 07:17.687
- We are 42 minutes
into our session,

07:17.687 --> 07:21.399
and you're just now getting
around to mentioning this little
event.

07:23.359 --> 07:25.361
- I don't know,

07:25.361 --> 07:27.947
I guess I didn't want you
to blame yourself.

07:27.947 --> 07:30.616
- Why would I blame myself?

07:30.616 --> 07:33.744
- Well, not blame yourself, but
like, maybe feel a little bit
guilty.

07:33.744 --> 07:37.081
- Why would I feel guilty?
-

07:37.081 --> 07:40.376
Because to me, it just seems
like part of a psychiatrist's
job

07:40.376 --> 07:43.212
is to make sure his patients
don't, you know, kill
themselves.

07:43.212 --> 07:45.131
- I can't prevent you
from killing yourself.

07:45.131 --> 07:46.382
- Clearly.

07:46.382 --> 07:47.884
- Although I might have a shot

07:47.884 --> 07:51.804
if you, you know, didn't
blow off your appointments.

07:51.804 --> 07:54.682
I have to remind you--
you owe for your last session

07:54.682 --> 07:57.310
because you failed to give
24 hour cancellation notice.

07:57.310 --> 07:59.604
- I didn't call to cancel

07:59.604 --> 08:01.856
'cause I was in the midst
of my suicide attempt.

08:01.856 --> 08:04.567
- The reason is irrelevant.

08:04.567 --> 08:06.235
All you had to do
was pick up the phone.

08:06.235 --> 08:09.113
Simple phone call, Ed.
- Are you kidding me?

08:09.113 --> 08:11.657
Are you--Seriously, are you
fucking kidding me, right now?

08:11.657 --> 08:14.535
- Would you like to
throttle it back a bit?

08:14.535 --> 08:17.788
I understand you've got
a reason to be upset.

08:17.788 --> 08:20.333
It's a great loss.
He's your brother.

08:20.333 --> 08:22.752
He was a smart guy.
A very complicated guy.

08:22.752 --> 08:25.671
- How do you know
he was complicated?

08:25.671 --> 08:27.715
- He was a patient.

08:30.051 --> 08:32.220
- What are--what are you tal--

08:32.220 --> 08:34.639
h-how could he be a patient?
He was in prison.

08:34.639 --> 08:37.433
- He was a patient
before prison.

08:37.433 --> 08:38.935
- You're joking.

08:38.935 --> 08:41.979
- This is not my joking face.

08:41.979 --> 08:44.232
- Why the hell
would you never tell me that?

08:44.232 --> 08:47.068
- I'm not allowed to.
Doctor/patient confidentiality.

08:47.068 --> 08:48.986
- What, so I have to
tell you everything?

08:48.986 --> 08:50.738
You can't tell me anything?
Nice relationship.

08:50.738 --> 08:51.989
Fuck, man.

08:54.033 --> 08:55.993
- Okay, I'll give you this.

08:55.993 --> 08:58.371
I had a couple of
phone sessions with him

08:58.371 --> 09:00.665
during the first year
of his incarceration,

09:00.665 --> 09:05.378
and either he lost interest,
or he just couldn't pay anymore.

09:05.378 --> 09:08.798
I-I can't remember
which one it was.

09:08.798 --> 09:12.927
- Okay, so then--I
mean, you know.

09:14.387 --> 09:17.682
- I know what?

09:17.682 --> 09:20.768
- He didn't take his own life.

09:20.768 --> 09:22.979
I killed him.
