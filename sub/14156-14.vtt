HORN DOG, BUT I'VE BEEN REALLY

14:59.100 --> 15:01.567
FEELING SOMETHING WITH THIS GUY.

15:01.567 --> 15:02.467
LIKE SUBSTANCE.

15:02.467 --> 15:03.433
>> WHAT, AND PARKER DOESN'T HAVE

15:03.433 --> 15:04.233
SUBSTANCE?

15:04.233 --> 15:04.900
>> I DON'T KNOW!

15:04.900 --> 15:06.500
IT'S WEIRD, BUT I REMEMBER

15:06.500 --> 15:07.533
FEELING THE SAME THING WITH

15:07.533 --> 15:08.500
DEREK, AND I FELL IN LOVE WITH

15:08.500 --> 15:09.300
HIM.

15:09.300 --> 15:10.367
>> DO I NEED TO SLAP YOU AGAIN?

15:10.367 --> 15:11.300
>> GIRL, IF YOU DO, WE'LL BE

15:11.300 --> 15:13.933
CATFIGHTING ALL OVER THIS PARTY.

15:13.933 --> 15:16.333
>> HMM.

15:16.333 --> 15:18.100
>> LOOK, YOU SHOULD GIVE ME YOUR

15:18.100 --> 15:18.867
NUMBER.

15:18.867 --> 15:20.333
I HAVE TO LEAVE, BUT I'D LIKE TO

15:20.333 --> 15:21.200
SEE YOU AGAIN.

15:21.200 --> 15:22.233
>> I DON'T THINK THAT'S SUCH A

15:22.233 --> 15:23.833
GOOD IDEA.

15:23.833 --> 15:25.267
I'M IN A RELATIONSHIP.

15:25.267 --> 15:27.733
>> OH...

15:27.733 --> 15:28.500
WELL, CAN WE AT LEAST BE

15:28.500 --> 15:29.467
FRIENDS?

15:29.467 --> 15:33.200
ARE YOU AVAILABLE FOR THAT?

15:41.267 --> 15:43.133
>> HEY, I'M SO GLAD YOU DECIDED

15:43.133 --> 15:44.667
TO COME.

15:44.667 --> 15:45.667
>> ME TOO.

15:45.667 --> 15:47.100
CONGRATULATIONS, CHARLES.

15:47.100 --> 15:48.133
EVERYTHING'S COMING TOGETHER FOR

15:48.133 --> 15:49.100
YOU.

15:49.100 --> 15:49.933
>> YOU TOO.

15:49.933 --> 15:51.333
ANTONIO, REAL PLEASURE TO MEET

15:51.333 --> 15:52.133
YOU.

15:52.133 --> 15:53.800
>> MY PLEASURE, MAN.

15:53.800 --> 15:57.533
>> NICE TO MEET YOU.

15:57.533 --> 16:00.167
>> OH, CHARLES, MAN...

16:00.167 --> 16:01.633
HE'S A GOOD GUY.

16:01.633 --> 16:03.500
>> YEAH.

16:03.500 --> 16:04.833
PADMA'S PRETTY COOL TOO, ISN'T

16:04.833 --> 16:07.333
SHE?

16:07.333 --> 16:09.333
DAMN.

16:09.333 --> 16:10.233
I GUESS I'D BETTER LEAVE IT

16:10.233 --> 16:11.100
ALONE.

16:11.100 --> 16:12.367
>> I'M SORRY.

16:12.367 --> 16:13.567
BUT, HEY, PERHAPS IT'S FOR THE

16:13.567 --> 16:15.300
BEST.

16:15.300 --> 16:17.267
OKAY?

16:28.600 --> 16:30.367
>> TODAY WAS HEAVEN, KASSEEM.

16:30.367 --> 16:31.367
THANK YOU.

16:31.367 --> 16:32.367
>> I WILL CALL YOU THIS EVENING

16:32.367 --> 16:33.400
TO MAKE SURE YOU HAVE ARRIVED

16:33.400 --> 16:34.433
HOME SAFELY.

16:34.433 --> 16:35.833
>> AW, YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO

16:35.833 --> 16:36.600
THAT.

16:36.600 --> 16:38.200
>> YES, I DO.

16:38.200 --> 16:39.400
YOU HAVE ALREADY BECOME QUITE

16:39.400 --> 16:42.400
PRECIOUS TO ME.

16:42.400 --> 16:46.067
UNTIL TONIGHT.

16:46.067 --> 16:47.833
>> SO WHERE EXACTLY IS HEAVEN

16:47.833 --> 16:49.300
LOCATED THESE DAYS?

16:49.300 --> 16:50.567
>> DOWNTOWN.

16:50.567 --> 16:52.100
HE TOOK ME ON A HORSE-DRAWN

16:52.100 --> 16:53.300
CARRIAGE RIDE THROUGH THE CITY

16:53.300 --> 16:54.567
DURING RUSH HOUR TRAFFIC.

16:54.567 --> 16:56.700
HE'S PERFECT.

16:56.700 --> 16:58.333
I'M DUMPING HIM.

16:58.333 --> 17:00.900
>> WHAT?

17:00.900 --> 17:02.233
WHY?

17:02.233 --> 17:04.100
>> BECAUSE THIS MAKES NO SENSE.

17:04.100 --> 17:05.533
HE'S BEEN ALL OVER THE WORLD,

17:05.533 --> 17:07.333
SPEAKS SIX LANGUAGES, AND SENT

17:07.333 --> 17:10.667
ME $5,000 WORTH OF SHOES.

17:10.667 --> 17:13.933
I SPENT TWO SUMMERS IN BILOXI,

17:13.933 --> 17:16.400
MISSISSIPPI, GOT A B-MINUS IN

17:16.400 --> 17:18.800
ENGLISH, AND MOST OF MY SHOES

17:18.800 --> 17:20.700
ARE BUY ONE, GET ONE FREE.

17:20.700 --> 17:22.567
>> SO WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

17:22.567 --> 17:23.633
YOU THINK KASSEEM'S OUT OF YOUR

17:23.633 --> 17:24.433
LEAGUE?

17:24.433 --> 17:26.233
>> I SAW THIS TV SHOW ONCE,

17:26.233 --> 17:28.200
WHERE MEN AND WOMEN SECRETLY

17:28.200 --> 17:29.900
RANKED THEMSELVES.

17:29.900 --> 17:31.900
DO YOU KNOW ALL THE SIXES PICKED

17:31.900 --> 17:33.967
SIXES, AND ALL THE NINES PICKED

17:33.967 --> 17:34.967
NINES?

17:34.967 --> 17:37.567
NOBODY PICKED ANYONE MORE THAN A

17:37.567 --> 17:39.433
POINT FROM THEIR NUMBER.

17:39.433 --> 17:42.367
>> OKAY...ONE, THAT SOUNDS LIKE

17:42.367 --> 17:43.700
VERY DESTRUCTIVE PROGRAMMING.

17:43.700 --> 17:45.867
TWO, YOU'RE CRAZY IF YOU THINK

17:45.867 --> 17:47.067
THAT APPLIES HERE.

17:47.067 --> 17:48.400
>> DON'T GET ME WRONG, I THINK

17:48.400 --> 17:50.467
I'M CUTE AND HAVE PLENTY TO

17:50.467 --> 17:51.533
OFFER.

17:51.533 --> 17:53.367
I'M JUST USED TO DATING THE

17:53.367 --> 17:55.700
CHAUFFEUR, NOT THE GUY BEING

17:55.700 --> 17:57.100
CHAUFFEURED.

17:57.100 --> 17:59.133
>> MORGAN, HE LIKES YOU.

17:59.133 --> 18:01.900
SO JUST FOCUS ON HOW YOU FEEL

18:01.900 --> 18:04.067
ABOUT EACH OTHER, AND NOTHING

18:04.067 --> 18:08.767
ELSE SHOULD MATTER.

18:08.767 --> 18:10.600
>> * THE PERFECT FIT

18:10.600 --> 18:12.633
* JUST HOW YOU LIKE IT

18:12.633 --> 18:14.267
* IT'S OBVIOUS *

18:14.267 --> 18:16.367
>> HM.

18:16.367 --> 18:19.067
UM, NEITHER, UNLESS YOU'RE GOING

18:19.067 --> 18:19.900
TO A FUNERAL.

18:19.900 --> 18:21.067
>> I KIND OF AM.

18:21.067 --> 18:22.433
I'D RATHER DIE THAN SEE REGGIE'S

18:22.433 --> 18:25.300
MOTHER AGAIN, BUT I PROMISED TO

18:25.300 --> 18:28.133
GO, SO I'M GONNA PLAY IT SAFE.

18:28.133 --> 18:30.100
>> YOU NEED TO PLAY IT LIKE YOU.

18:30.100 --> 18:31.167
DON'T SWITCH UP FOR NO

18:31.167 --> 18:34.200
JUDGMENTAL BIDDY.

18:34.200 --> 18:35.767
>> YEAH, AND REGGIE WOULDN'T

18:35.767 --> 18:37.167
TAKE YOU HOME UNLESS HE SET HER

18:37.167 --> 18:38.267
STRAIGHT ABOUT HOW IMPORTANT

18:38.267 --> 18:39.067
YOU ARE TO HIM.

18:39.067 --> 18:40.233
>> I KNOW, BUT THAT DOESN'T MAKE

18:40.233 --> 18:42.067
IT ANY EASIER.

18:42.067 --> 18:42.867
OH.

18:42.867 --> 18:45.733
THIS IS CUTE THOUGH.

18:45.733 --> 18:47.733
>> [laughs] PLEASE.

18:47.733 --> 18:49.167
MALCOLM SAID HE NEEDS TO TALK TO

18:49.167 --> 18:51.900
ME IN PERSON, AND IT'S URGENT.

18:51.900 --> 18:52.867
BUT I DON'T NEED HIS DRAMA RIGHT

18:52.867 --> 18:55.300
NOW, MM-MMM, ESPECIALLY NOT

18:55.300 --> 18:56.800
BEFORE I GO TO PHOENIX.

18:56.800 --> 18:58.533
I NEED TO FOCUS.

18:58.533 --> 19:00.500
YEAH.

19:00.500 --> 19:02.933
>> PADMA?

19:02.933 --> 19:04.633
>> HELLO.

19:04.633 --> 19:06.933
MAY I HAVE A WORD WITH YOU?

19:06.933 --> 19:09.567
>> OF COURSE.

19:09.567 --> 19:11.067
>> CONVENTIONAL WISDOM SAYS I

19:11.067 --> 19:13.800
SHOULD LEAVE WELL ENOUGH ALONE.

19:13.800 --> 19:15.067
BUT THERE'S NOTHING TRULY

19:15.067 --> 19:17.333
CONVENTIONAL ABOUT WISDOM, IS

19:17.333 --> 19:19.267
THERE?

19:19.267 --> 19:20.767
>> I SUPPOSE THERE ISN'T.

19:20.767 --> 19:22.867
>> I LOVE CHARLES, AND I'M

19:22.867 --> 19:25.800
THRILLED TO BE BACK IN HIS LIFE,

19:25.800 --> 19:26.867
BUT I NEED TO BE SURE HE'S

19:26.867 --> 19:30.333
HAPPY, AND I CAN ONLY DO THAT IF

19:30.333 --> 19:31.700
HE MAKES AN INFORMED DECISION

19:31.700 --> 19:35.467
BETWEEN US.

19:35.467 --> 19:37.367
>> BUT HE'S ALREADY CHOSEN YOU.

19:37.367 --> 19:38.700
>> I'D FEEL BETTER IF HE MADE

19:38.700 --> 19:40.767
THAT CHOICE KNOWING YOU LOVE HIM

19:40.767 --> 19:42.667
TOO.

19:42.667 --> 19:43.567
>> [whispering] I DID NOT SEE

19:43.567 --> 19:44.367
THAT COMING.

19:44.367 --> 19:45.167
>> SHH.

19:45.167 --> 19:46.100
>> HE TOLD ME YOU DIDN'T LOVE

19:46.100 --> 19:49.400
HIM, AND HE STILL BELIEVES THAT.

19:49.400 --> 19:51.500
>> PADMA, I DON'T THINK WE

19:51.500 --> 19:52.333
SHOULD BE HAVING THIS

19:52.333 --> 19:53.333
CONVERSATION.

19:53.333 --> 19:54.133
>> I THINK YOU SHOULD TELL

19:54.133 --> 19:55.533
CHARLES HOW YOU FEEL.

19:55.533 --> 19:57.367
I OWE HIM THAT MUCH.

19:57.367 --> 19:59.633
HE HAS NO CLUE I'M HERE, SO...

19:59.633 --> 20:01.633
NEXT MOVE IS YOURS.

20:01.633 --> 20:04.300
GOOD-BYE.

20:18.033 --> 20:19.300
>> DID SHE JUST ASK ME TO TELL

20:19.300 --> 20:20.500
THE MAN THAT SHE LOVES THAT I

20:20.500 --> 20:21.300
LOVE HIM TOO?

20:21.300 --> 20:22.633
>> I KNOW IT SOUNDS CRAZY, BUT

20:22.633 --> 20:23.700
SHE HAS A GOOD POINT.

20:23.700 --> 20:24.567
I MEAN, WHO WANTS TO BE WITH A

20:24.567 --> 20:25.500
GUY WHO'S IN LOVE WITH SOMEONE

20:25.500 --> 20:26.300
ELSE?

20:26.300 --> 20:27.600
>> PLEASE, AS HARD AS IT IS TO

20:27.600 --> 20:29.533
FIND A GOOD MAN, WHAT WOMAN IN

20:29.533 --> 20:31.033
HER RIGHT MIND WOULD OFFER UP

20:31.033 --> 20:32.133
HER OWN?

20:32.133 --> 20:33.500
>> I BET SHE'S CONVINCED HE

20:33.500 --> 20:35.300
WON'T CHOOSE YOU, BUT WANTS HER

20:35.300 --> 20:36.400
CONSCIENCE CLEAR.

20:36.400 --> 20:37.400
>> AND DOESN'T MIND LETTING

20:37.400 --> 20:39.400
RAQUEL PLAY HERSELF TO DO IT.

20:39.400 --> 20:40.467
>> DAMN!

20:40.467 --> 20:43.300
THAT IS MASTERMIND.

20:43.300 --> 20:45.000
EVERY TIME I THINK I UNDERSTAND

20:45.000 --> 20:46.567
YOU BITCHES, YOU TAKE IT TO A

20:46.567 --> 20:49.400
WHOLE OTHER LEVEL.

20:49.400 --> 20:50.700
>> [exhales] GOD, I DON'T KNOW

20:50.700 --> 20:53.233
WHAT TO DO.

20:53.233 --> 20:55.667
>> GIRL, PLEASE.

20:55.667 --> 20:57.367
GO GET YOUR MAN.

21:05.900 --> 21:07.900
IT'S ALL CUED UP, BUT I DON'T

21:07.900 --> 21:08.767
KNOW HOW TO HOOK IT UP TO THEIR

21:08.767 --> 21:09.567
SYSTEM.

21:09.567 --> 21:10.433
>> I'VE DONE TONS OF THESE.

21:10.433 --> 21:12.100
I'LL TAKE CARE OF IT.

21:12.100 --> 21:13.267
AND DON'T BE SO NERVOUS.

21:13.267 --> 21:15.400
>> [exhales] IT'S JUST--IT'S MY

21:15.400 --> 21:16.667
FIRST TIME.

21:16.667 --> 21:17.500
>> YOU'LL BE GREAT.

21:17.500 --> 21:18.733
I'VE SEEN YOU IN ACTION.

21:18.733 --> 21:20.133
AND AFTER WE'RE DONE, SOME LOCAL

21:20.133 --> 21:21.667
REALTORS INVITED US TO PARTY

21:21.667 --> 21:23.767
WITH THEM IN SCOTTSDALE.

21:23.767 --> 21:26.900
AND BY "LOCAL," I MEAN "CUTE."

21:26.900 --> 21:30.100
>> [chuckles]

21:30.100 --> 21:31.167
MALCOLM?

21:31.167 --> 21:32.067
>> WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN

21:32.067 --> 21:36.133
PHOENIX?

21:36.133 --> 21:38.400
I'M GONNA GO GET YOU SET UP.

21:38.400 --> 21:39.833
YOU SPEAK IN LESS THAN TEN, SO

21:39.833 --> 21:44.433
DON'T GO DISAPPEARING ON ME.

21:44.433 --> 21:45.333
>> I TOLD YOU THAT WE NEEDED TO

21:45.333 --> 21:46.233
TALK.

21:46.233 --> 21:47.433
>> AND I TOLD YOU I HAD A

21:47.433 --> 21:48.833
CONFERENCE.

21:48.833 --> 21:49.867
I'M ABOUT TO GIVE A PRESENTATION

21:49.867 --> 21:51.400
IN POWERPOINT.

21:51.400 --> 21:53.167
YES, KEISHA GREENE KNOWS

21:53.167 --> 21:54.067
POWERPOINT.

21:54.067 --> 21:56.833
>> OKAY, HERE'S THE THING.

21:56.833 --> 22:00.500
I LEFT TAYLOR.

22:00.500 --> 22:01.600
>> WHY?

22:01.600 --> 22:02.667
CLEARLY SHE'S QUICKER AT

22:02.667 --> 22:04.533
BAILING YOU OUT OF JAIL THAN ME,

22:04.533 --> 22:05.900
SO YOU MIGHT WANNA RETHINK THAT.

22:05.900 --> 22:08.200
>> KEISHA, I HAD ONE PHONE CALL,

22:08.200 --> 22:10.333
AND I MADE IT TO YOU.

22:10.333 --> 22:11.633
BUT I WAS LATE COMING HOME,

22:11.633 --> 22:12.667
TAYLOR FREAKED OUT AND CALLED

22:12.667 --> 22:13.467
AROUND.

22:13.467 --> 22:14.900
SHE FOUND ME.

22:14.900 --> 22:18.367
THE BOTTOM LINE IS IT'S OVER.

22:18.367 --> 22:23.100
SO...SAY SOMETHING.

22:23.100 --> 22:24.733
>> YOU SAY SOMETHING.

22:24.733 --> 22:25.700
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO CAME ALL THE

22:25.700 --> 22:27.500
WAY HERE.

22:27.500 --> 22:28.967
>> WHY ARE YOU PLAYING GAMES?

22:28.967 --> 22:29.800
>> YOU MAY HAVE BROKEN UP WITH

22:29.800 --> 22:32.067
TAYLOR, BUT I'M STILL WITH SEAN.

22:32.067 --> 22:33.300
>> THAT'S YOUR RESPONSE TO THIS?

22:33.300 --> 22:34.100
>> SHOULD I HAVE A DIFFERENT

22:34.100 --> 22:35.767
ONE?

22:46.067 --> 22:47.700
>> WELL, WE BOTH RACKED UP

22:47.700 --> 22:48.667
TODAY.

22:48.667 --> 22:49.867
YOU ON CLOTHES, ME ON

22:49.867 --> 22:50.700
COMMISSION.

22:50.700 --> 22:51.533
>> WELL, I DID GO A BIT

22:51.533 --> 22:53.067
OVERBOARD, BUT I'M ONLY IN

22:53.067 --> 22:54.233
ATLANTA FOR A SHORT TIME, AND I

22:54.233 --> 22:55.333
LOVE SHOPPING IN AMERICA.

22:55.333 --> 22:56.867
>> WELL, ME TOO, WHEN I CAN

22:56.867 --> 22:59.433
AFFORD IT.

22:59.433 --> 23:01.433
ADIRAH AL JAHNI!

23:01.433 --> 23:02.733
I KNOW A KASSEEM AL JAHNI.

23:02.733 --> 23:03.667
ANY CHANCE YOU'RE RELATED?

NEXT TIME, I WON'T BE SO POLITE.

31:29.533 --> 31:31.067
>> OKAY.

31:31.067 --> 31:33.100
SO WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO THEN?

31:33.100 --> 31:33.900
>> OH!

31:33.900 --> 31:36.300
>> AAH!

31:36.300 --> 31:37.800
>> I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS.

31:37.800 --> 31:38.600
>> NO, NO, NO, NO!

31:38.600 --> 31:39.633
>> OH!

31:39.633 --> 31:40.367
[grunting]

31:40.367 --> 31:42.133
>> AAH!

31:42.133 --> 31:43.600
NO!

31:43.600 --> 31:45.100
STOP IT, DAMN IT!

31:45.100 --> 31:47.867
WINSTON, DO SOMETHING!

31:47.867 --> 31:52.200
[grunting]

31:52.200 --> 31:56.300
EVERYBODY, PLEASE, JUST GO.

31:56.300 --> 32:01.433
GO!

32:01.433 --> 32:03.433
SEAN, CAN YOU STAY A MINUTE?

32:07.933 --> 32:09.933
>> both: CALL ME.

32:09.933 --> 32:14.700
>> YEAH.

32:14.700 --> 32:18.767
>> I'M HERE.

32:28.333 --> 32:30.233
>> THERE YOU ARE.

32:30.233 --> 32:31.400
YOU ARE NOT RESPONDING TO MY

32:31.400 --> 32:32.500
CALLS.

32:32.500 --> 32:34.300
HAS SOMETHING HAPPENED?

32:34.300 --> 32:35.400
>> YES.

32:35.400 --> 32:39.833
YOUR WIFE HAPPENED.

32:39.833 --> 32:40.633
>> MAY I HAVE A CHANCE TO

32:40.633 --> 32:41.433
EXPLAIN?

32:41.433 --> 32:42.900
>> WHAT'S TO EXPLAIN?

32:42.900 --> 32:45.267
YOU HAVE A WIFE.

32:45.267 --> 32:46.133
I KNEW YOU WERE TOO GOOD TO BE

32:46.133 --> 32:47.467
TRUE.

32:47.467 --> 32:49.600
>> I DO NOT HAVE A WIFE.

32:49.600 --> 32:50.667
I HAVE THREE.

32:50.667 --> 32:51.467
>> WHAT?

32:51.467 --> 32:53.300
>> ISLAMIC LAW ALLOWS FOR A MAN

32:53.300 --> 32:54.767
TO HAVE UP TO FOUR, IF HE CAN

32:54.767 --> 32:56.100
AFFORD TO SUPPORT THEM.

32:56.100 --> 32:57.700
>> WELL, THEN, I GUESS

32:57.700 --> 32:59.733
CONGRATULATIONS ARE IN ORDER

32:59.733 --> 33:01.867
THREE TIMES OVER.

33:01.867 --> 33:02.933
>> I WAS GOING TO TELL YOU ABOUT

33:02.933 --> 33:04.067
ALL OF THIS EVENTUALLY, BUT

33:04.067 --> 33:06.067
APPARENTLY, NOW IS THE TIME.

33:06.067 --> 33:08.967
SO...

33:08.967 --> 33:10.867
I AM A PRINCE.

33:10.867 --> 33:16.067
MY COUSIN IS THE KING.

33:16.067 --> 33:18.067
>> THREE WIVES?

33:18.067 --> 33:20.367
A PRINCE?

33:20.367 --> 33:21.567
ANY OTHER BOMBSHELLS YOU WANNA

33:21.567 --> 33:22.633
DROP?

33:22.633 --> 33:24.733
>> YES.

33:24.733 --> 33:27.833
I KNOW THIS IS SUDDEN, BUT WILL

33:27.833 --> 33:31.633
YOU BE MY FOURTH AND FINAL WIFE?

33:42.400 --> 33:46.067
>> IS THIS REALITY, BECAUSE IT

33:46.067 --> 33:47.367
FEELS LIKE ASHTON KUTCHER'S

33:47.367 --> 33:48.367
ABOUT TO JUMP OUT FROM BEHIND

33:48.367 --> 33:50.200
A CLOTHES RACK.

33:50.200 --> 33:54.567
>> I AM VERY SERIOUS, MORGAN.

33:54.567 --> 33:56.067
>> YOU WANT ME TO BE A PART OF

33:56.067 --> 33:56.867
A HAREM?

33:56.867 --> 33:58.367
>> OF COURSE NOT.

33:58.367 --> 33:59.833
THAT IS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT,

33:59.833 --> 34:01.300
AND I WOULD NEVER INSULT YOU

34:01.300 --> 34:02.867
LIKE THAT.

34:02.867 --> 34:06.067
I REVERE AND RESPECT MY WIVES.

34:06.067 --> 34:07.467
>> SO EVERYBODY'S JUST ONE BIG,

34:07.467 --> 34:08.733
HAPPY FAMILY, HUH?

34:08.733 --> 34:11.533
>> YES, ESPECIALLY BECAUSE THEY

34:11.533 --> 34:13.967
ALL HAVE THEIR OWN HOUSES AND

34:13.967 --> 34:16.333
THEIR OWN LIVES.

34:16.333 --> 34:17.400
YOU CAN HAVE ONE RIGHT HERE IN

34:17.400 --> 34:19.667
ATLANTA, AND YOUR DAUGHTER CAN

34:19.667 --> 34:21.067
GO TO THE BEST SCHOOLS, AS IT

34:21.067 --> 34:23.167
WILL BE MY DUTY TO FINANCE HER

34:23.167 --> 34:24.267
EDUCATION.

34:24.267 --> 34:27.067
YOU CAN WORK, GO TO SCHOOL,

34:27.067 --> 34:29.267
START YOUR OWN BUSINESS, OR JUST

34:29.267 --> 34:32.200
RELAX.

34:32.200 --> 34:35.333
>> KASSEEM, WE'VE ONLY BEEN ON

34:35.333 --> 34:37.733
THREE DATES.

34:37.733 --> 34:39.667
WE BARELY KNOW EACH OTHER.

34:39.667 --> 34:42.300
>> I KNOW MYSELF.

34:42.300 --> 34:45.300
I TRUST MY INSTINCTS, AND I KNOW

34:45.300 --> 34:49.067
HOW I FEEL ABOUT YOU.

34:49.067 --> 34:52.800
>> SO YOU WANT ME TO BE YOUR

34:52.800 --> 34:55.067
PRINCESS?

34:55.067 --> 34:58.100
>> WILL YOU?

35:02.400 --> 35:04.067
>> I KNOW...

35:04.067 --> 35:07.167
BUT LET ME SAY IT FIRST.

35:07.167 --> 35:09.867
YOU AND ME AREN'T YOU AND ME

35:09.867 --> 35:13.167
ANYMORE, ARE WE?

35:17.633 --> 35:21.167
>> I'LL ALWAYS LOVE YOU, SEAN,

35:21.167 --> 35:23.633
BUT WE'RE DIFFERENT NOW.

35:23.633 --> 35:26.067
I REALLY TRIED TO MAKE THIS

35:26.067 --> 35:31.267
WORK, BUT WE'RE NOT THERE.

35:31.267 --> 35:35.067
>> YEAH.

35:35.067 --> 35:37.067
WELL, I THINK WE BOTH KNOW WHY

35:37.067 --> 35:38.100
YOU COULDN'T GET THERE.

35:46.067 --> 35:47.233
>> LAST TIME AROUND, IT WAS ON

35:47.233 --> 35:49.667
YOU.

35:49.667 --> 35:50.833
THIS ONE'S ON ME.

35:55.067 --> 35:56.167
>> I'D CALL IT EVEN, EXCEPT I

35:56.167 --> 35:57.533
STILL FEEL LIKE THE LOSER.

35:57.533 --> 35:58.767
>> WELL, YOU'LL ALWAYS BE CLOSE

35:58.767 --> 36:00.633
TO MY HEART.

36:00.633 --> 36:01.833
YOU KNOW THAT, RIGHT?

36:01.833 --> 36:05.133
>> YEAH.

36:10.433 --> 36:13.367
GOOD-BYE, KEISHA.

36:13.367 --> 36:16.067
>> GOOD-BYE, SEAN.

36:32.667 --> 36:33.600
>> HELENE, EVERYTHING IS

36:33.600 --> 36:34.433
DELICIOUS.

36:34.433 --> 36:35.467
>> I TOLD YOU MOM'S MAC AND

36:35.467 --> 36:37.067
CHEESE WAS NOT TO BE MISSED.

36:37.067 --> 36:39.767
[laughter]

36:39.767 --> 36:43.367
OH.

36:43.367 --> 36:46.433
>> REGGIE, YOU'RE MY ONLY SON,

36:46.433 --> 36:47.300
AND YOU KNOW I LOVE YOU MORE

36:47.300 --> 36:48.833
THAN ANYTHING.

36:48.833 --> 36:50.867
>> YEAH, I'M PRETTY CLEAR ON

36:50.867 --> 36:53.733
THAT.

36:53.733 --> 36:55.467
UH, WHAT'S GOING ON?

36:55.467 --> 36:57.767
>> WE LOVE AND SUPPORT YOU NO

36:57.767 --> 37:00.067
MATTER WHAT.

37:00.067 --> 37:00.933
>> BUT WE CAN NO LONGER

37:00.933 --> 37:03.733
CONTINUE TO LET YOU LIVE A LIE,

37:03.733 --> 37:05.200
SO THE FAMILY DECIDED TO HOLD

37:05.200 --> 37:07.200
THIS INTERVENTION.

37:07.200 --> 37:08.067
>> ARE YOU ON DRUGS?

37:08.067 --> 37:10.200
>> NO!

37:10.200 --> 37:11.667
MOM, WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?

37:11.667 --> 37:12.867
>> PLEASE STOP PLAYING GAMES

37:12.867 --> 37:14.467
WITH OTHER PEOPLE'S LIVES,

37:14.467 --> 37:15.900
AND ADMIT, ONCE AND FOR ALL,

37:15.900 --> 37:20.467
REGGIE, THAT YOU ARE GAY.

37:20.467 --> 37:23.067
>> G--

37:23.067 --> 37:25.067
>> [gasps]

37:34.500 --> 37:38.167
>> HEY.

37:38.167 --> 37:40.433
HOW'S YOUR HEAD?

37:40.433 --> 37:42.067
>> HARD AS EVER, BUT I'M

37:42.067 --> 37:43.433
CHANGING THAT.

37:43.433 --> 37:44.867
>> OH?

37:44.867 --> 37:47.600
HOW SO?

37:54.067 --> 37:58.633
>> I ALMOST LOST YOU TODAY.

38:01.433 --> 38:04.467
I WENT HOME, AND I THOUGHT ABOUT

38:04.467 --> 38:07.867
THAT, AND IT MADE ME SICK.

38:07.867 --> 38:08.833
BABY, THE WAY IT'S BEEN GOING

38:08.833 --> 38:10.600
ALL THESE MONTHS IS NOT HOW IT'S

38:10.600 --> 38:11.900
SUPPOSED TO GO, NOT WITH US.

38:11.900 --> 38:15.500
WHAT ARE WE DOING?

38:15.500 --> 38:19.767
KEISHA, I LOVE YOU.

38:19.767 --> 38:21.933
>> I LOVE YOU TOO, AND I'M

38:21.933 --> 38:25.167
NEVER LETTING YOU GO AGAIN.

38:25.167 --> 38:26.533
THIS IS WHERE I WANNA BE.

38:26.533 --> 38:30.133
THIS IS WHERE I BELONG...

38:30.133 --> 38:31.633
WITH YOU.

38:43.233 --> 38:46.633
OKAY, SO HOW DO WE DO THIS?

38:46.633 --> 38:49.067
>> MAYBE START FRESH,

38:49.067 --> 38:50.467
SOMEPLACE NEW.

38:50.467 --> 38:51.700
>> YOU MEAN LEAVE ATLANTA?

38:51.700 --> 38:52.800
>> I CAN RUN FRANK'S JEWELS FROM

38:52.800 --> 38:53.600
ANYWHERE.

38:53.600 --> 38:55.133
ZURICH, AMSTERDAM,

38:55.133 --> 38:57.100
BEVERLY HILLS, VEGAS.

38:57.100 --> 38:58.700
VEGAS IS WHERE WE MET AND HAD

38:58.700 --> 39:03.400
THE MOST LUCK.

39:03.400 --> 39:05.267
SO WHAT DO YOU SAY?

39:05.267 --> 39:06.467
>> SO MUCH HAS CHANGED IN THE

39:06.467 --> 39:09.833
LAST 24 HOURS.

39:09.833 --> 39:12.500
I NEED TO THINK.

39:12.500 --> 39:13.667
>> YOU KNOW WHERE I GO WHEN I'VE

39:13.667 --> 39:15.200
GOT BIG DECISIONS STARING ME

39:15.200 --> 39:18.600
DOWN?

39:18.600 --> 39:20.467
UP.

39:20.467 --> 39:21.933
