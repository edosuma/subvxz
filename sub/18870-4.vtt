00:01.067 --> 00:03.303
<i>Previously on "Being Mary Jane"...</i>

00:03.370 --> 00:06.706
How does my little brother, who used
to twirl signs on the street corner,

00:06.773 --> 00:07.807
afford this?

00:07.874 --> 00:09.776
My old boss in LA

00:09.843 --> 00:13.012
hooked me up with one of the best
real estate firms in New York.

00:13.079 --> 00:15.048
Come out with it.

00:15.115 --> 00:16.282
Come on.

00:16.349 --> 00:19.119
Justin Talbot... now this brother
told me that he had my back.

00:19.185 --> 00:22.088
What I didn't realize is that meant
stabbing me in my back.

00:22.789 --> 00:27.060
And now you're a correspondent on one
of America's top-rated morning shows.

00:27.127 --> 00:29.929
I say Justin Talbot, he did you a favor.

00:29.996 --> 00:32.999
We'll be back with Orlando Lagos
who's gonna show us the key

00:33.066 --> 00:34.701
to his signature swing.

00:34.768 --> 00:37.337
- You have fun doing this.
- It's the best job in the world.

00:37.404 --> 00:39.072
Yeah, how'd you get started, anyway?

00:39.139 --> 00:41.508
You wanna get out while
you're at the top of your game,

00:41.574 --> 00:44.477
and if you're looking to be
the next Michael Strahan,

00:45.745 --> 00:47.480
- I can help you.
- What's in it for you?

00:47.547 --> 00:50.784
Let's just say making you look good
makes me look even better.

00:50.850 --> 00:53.420
I've gotta get serious
about finding a new place.

00:53.486 --> 00:54.888
Do you know what? I do, too.

00:54.954 --> 00:56.856
My sublet's up soon.

00:56.923 --> 00:59.759
My brother's showing me
a listing tomorrow afternoon.

00:59.826 --> 01:02.996
Look, we're not actually having
this conversation now, are we?

01:03.062 --> 01:07.734
No, 'cause it's way too early
for us to be even thinking about this.

01:07.801 --> 01:10.303
- You haven't met my kids.
- Exactly.

01:10.370 --> 01:12.705
I suppose
that congratulations are in order.

01:12.772 --> 01:15.909
You and Mercedes broke the internet.
We should capitalize on it.

01:15.975 --> 01:17.977
Ronda came up
with a great way to do just that.

01:18.044 --> 01:21.247
She suggested that you become
our resident web correspondent.

01:21.948 --> 01:24.284
- What are you doing?
- I'm the new senior producer.

01:24.350 --> 01:25.552
Producer? Here?

01:25.618 --> 01:27.086
When Ronda Sales invites you

01:27.153 --> 01:29.989
on the biggest morning show
in the country, you answer.

01:32.492 --> 01:34.260
Lord Jesus have mercy.

01:35.228 --> 01:37.964
- You too, Ty?
- Child, please.

01:38.031 --> 01:40.834
Justin's fineness trumps
whatever y'all got going on.

01:43.470 --> 01:45.205
Can nobody see through this?

01:45.271 --> 01:47.006
Apparently not.

01:47.073 --> 01:49.075
He did the same damn thing in Atlanta.

01:49.142 --> 01:51.978
He's your friend... until he isn't.

01:52.045 --> 01:54.714
The last thing I need
is Justin with an army on his side.

01:57.317 --> 01:59.519
<i>-Man, it's okay.
- What are you doing?</i>

01:59.586 --> 02:02.589
Is someone assaulting
that boy in broad daylight?

02:02.655 --> 02:03.957
Yeah, it the kid's dad.

02:04.023 --> 02:06.192
He dragged him away for wearing a kilt.

02:06.259 --> 02:08.394
The story's huge all over social media.

02:08.461 --> 02:09.596
Do we have details?

02:09.662 --> 02:13.099
Yeah, his name is Calhoun Jeffries,
and the assault happened yesterday.

02:13.166 --> 02:14.434
Assault?

02:15.335 --> 02:17.370
You said it's the kid's dad, right?

02:17.437 --> 02:19.973
Yeah, but it's been extremely polarizing.

02:20.039 --> 02:22.976
Some people, like me,
consider this gender-bashing.

02:23.042 --> 02:25.211
- Okay.
- I call it good parenting.

02:26.112 --> 02:27.480
What's your angle?

02:27.547 --> 02:29.649
The way it's trending,
it's gonna be a huge story.

02:30.416 --> 02:33.019
This is how we're reporting now,
chasing Twitter feeds?

02:33.086 --> 02:34.654
I mean, where's the journalism?

02:34.721 --> 02:38.324
- Exactly. This isn't news.
- Okay, then what is it?

02:38.391 --> 02:39.726
A family matter.

02:40.627 --> 02:41.794
Because it's the father,

02:41.861 --> 02:44.531
we're going to overlook
that a child has been assaulted.

02:44.597 --> 02:45.865
Mary Jane, I...

02:45.932 --> 02:47.433
I agree the footage is shocking.

02:47.500 --> 02:49.736
But Justin and Ronda do have a point.

02:49.802 --> 02:54.307
Let's back burner the story for now
and see where it goes on social media.

02:55.174 --> 02:59.212
Sorry, my phone bumped yours off the TV.

02:59.612 --> 03:01.681
Did you take up knitting, Natalie?

03:01.748 --> 03:04.284
There's a declutter book
climbing the bestseller list.

03:04.350 --> 03:05.385
Another one?

03:05.451 --> 03:07.921
Ronda, you mentioned
something to me earlier.

03:07.987 --> 03:10.690
Yes, I did.
Vera Wang called me the other day.

03:10.757 --> 03:13.226
I guess it's time
for my Winter Wedding segment.

03:13.293 --> 03:15.862
Great. Let's go with winter
wedding gowns for now.

03:15.929 --> 03:16.996
Thank you.

03:17.063 --> 03:19.332
All right, good work, everyone.
That's it for now.

03:20.133 --> 03:21.935
You're getting a kick out of this.

03:23.236 --> 03:25.572
- Being a news producer?
- Don't be coy.

03:26.072 --> 03:27.874
You've been blocking me at every turn.

03:27.941 --> 03:30.443
- I'm not the problem here.
- So, it's my imagination.

03:30.510 --> 03:33.446
- You didn't have a sufficient angle.
- That's not for you to say.

03:33.513 --> 03:36.115
Garrett has asked me
to produce your stories.

03:36.616 --> 03:40.486
- And why would he do that?
- Good question.

03:40.553 --> 03:45.725
It's either punishment
for what happened with our reality star,

03:45.792 --> 03:47.193
or a reward.

03:47.894 --> 03:49.195
I'm not sure which.

03:49.262 --> 03:53.800
So, I'm just supposed to believe
that this is all Garrett's doing.

03:53.866 --> 03:56.769
You think I wanted to be paired
with a web correspondent?

04:01.608 --> 04:03.977
I'm not one to dwell on the past.

04:04.043 --> 04:06.846
What's done is done, okay?

04:06.913 --> 04:10.216
I'm focused on producing killer stories
and you should, too.

04:12.819 --> 04:15.254
Images of a New Jersey teen
being assaulted

04:15.321 --> 04:16.789
have set Twitter abuzz.

04:16.856 --> 04:18.558
- Some are saying it's an act...
- Hey.

04:18.625 --> 04:20.593
I thought this story idea got shot down.

04:20.660 --> 04:22.795
- It did.
- So, what are you doing?

04:22.862 --> 04:24.964
Garrett said to put it
on the back burner,

04:25.031 --> 04:26.966
but he didn't say
I couldn't put it online.

04:27.033 --> 04:29.535
- And you are the web correspondent.
- I am.

04:30.670 --> 04:34.307
So, if the story keeps trending,
it'll get Garrett's attention.

04:34.941 --> 04:36.409
Very smart.

04:36.976 --> 04:40.546
Except, because of that asshole Justin,
I can't produce it.

04:40.613 --> 04:44.250
Yeah, but you were given the opportunity
to work with Ronda and Aaron.

04:44.917 --> 04:47.353
- Run with it.
- But I'll give him a piece of my mind

04:47.420 --> 04:49.589
'cause he's pissing
all over my territory.

04:50.623 --> 04:53.559
Crap, I'm late. I've gotta go
help Orlando with his reel now.

04:53.626 --> 04:56.362
You definitely have kept up
your end of the bargain.

04:56.429 --> 04:59.899
Hey, if this news thing doesn't work out,
I have a future as an agent.

05:00.733 --> 05:03.569
<i>People complain the baseball season
is too long and I agree.</i>

05:03.636 --> 05:06.673
<i>But baseball clings to its traditions,
which is killing the sport.</i>

05:06.739 --> 05:08.441
How much longer?

05:12.211 --> 05:14.213
Half an hour or so.

05:14.280 --> 05:17.583
- Are you bored?
- No.

05:17.650 --> 05:21.087
I was just thinking that... maybe after?

05:21.154 --> 05:22.455
<i>Una bebida.</i>

05:22.955 --> 05:24.524
<i>Los dos solitos.</i>

05:28.294 --> 05:31.030
Listen, I had
a lot of fun the other night.

05:31.097 --> 05:35.968
- Yeah, the tequila was good.
- Yeah, it was. It was really good, yeah.

05:36.035 --> 05:37.937
But I don't...

05:39.005 --> 05:41.441
I just don't wanna go there, okay? So...

05:42.375 --> 05:43.710
Why not?

05:43.776 --> 05:45.778
Because we have an understanding

05:45.845 --> 05:48.581
and we're just doing
one another a favor, so...

05:49.248 --> 05:50.583
Exactly.

05:56.589 --> 05:58.925
<i>Images of a New Jersey teen
being assaulted</i>

05:58.991 --> 06:00.693
<i>have set Twitter abuzz.</i>

06:00.760 --> 06:02.829
Two million views already.

06:02.895 --> 06:05.031
This New Jersey story
is really blowing up.

06:05.098 --> 06:09.402
It's a controversial issue and it just
made sense to put it out on our platform.

06:09.469 --> 06:10.636
Good work.

06:11.337 --> 06:14.474
All right, let's get on this, you two.
It's great for the 8 o'clock hour.

06:14.540 --> 06:15.541
Garrett...

06:16.409 --> 06:17.710
I don't know if it's...

06:17.777 --> 06:19.312
Well, what's not to know?

06:19.378 --> 06:21.347
Thanks to Mary Jane, we own the story.

06:22.115 --> 06:24.717
- Now can you land this kid?
- I can get him.

06:25.451 --> 06:26.919
Just you watch.

06:58.651 --> 07:00.286
Come on, I know you're in there.

07:02.555 --> 07:03.956
Come on.

07:58.511 --> 08:01.180
That smells good. Time to set the table?

08:01.247 --> 08:02.481
Almost.

08:03.082 --> 08:06.385
I think at this point,
I'm just prolonging my pleasure.

08:06.452 --> 08:08.020
I miss my kitchen.

08:08.087 --> 08:10.823
You can get
but so creative in a hotel wet bar.

08:10.890 --> 08:13.526
I'm missing that southern cooking,
don't keep us waiting.

08:13.593 --> 08:15.127
It's not...

08:16.028 --> 08:17.263
Yeah.

08:17.330 --> 08:21.367
- My little brother with a Rolex?
- Just a gift from my client, Olivia.

08:22.368 --> 08:23.769
Your client?

08:23.836 --> 08:26.205
- A little trust here, okay?
- I trust you.

08:26.272 --> 08:28.241
So, when can I meet this client?

08:29.976 --> 08:32.111
You know, if everything's above board.

08:32.178 --> 08:34.280
You're on. I'll set up some time.

08:34.347 --> 08:36.849
Could one of you grab
the profiteroles out of the fridge,

08:36.916 --> 08:38.684
so they can come up to room temperature?

08:39.785 --> 08:42.722
I stopped at Fleur du Mal
on the way here.

08:42.788 --> 08:44.724
I've been dying to go to that place.

08:44.790 --> 08:46.525
It's my latest obsession.

08:49.328 --> 08:51.764
Look at you two
like an old married couple.

08:51.831 --> 08:56.769
Please. We need just a little bit
more time in the honeymoon stage.

08:56.836 --> 08:58.337
I'm serious, MJ.

08:58.404 --> 09:01.173
I've never seen you so at ease
with a guy before.

09:01.240 --> 09:02.775
It's nice.

09:02.842 --> 09:04.577
What's up with you and the ball player?

09:04.644 --> 09:07.480
That's not a real relationship.
It's more like a business deal.

09:07.546 --> 09:08.614
- Really?
- Yeah.

09:08.681 --> 09:12.218
At this stage in my life,
I don't want a man that weighs me down.

09:12.285 --> 09:14.620
Between my job,
flying back and forth to Atlanta,

09:14.687 --> 09:17.723
and trying to see the kids as much
as I can, it's just not gonna happen.

09:17.790 --> 09:19.425
- Well, cheers.
- Yeah.

09:19.492 --> 09:20.860
To being busy.

09:20.927 --> 09:23.129
-'Cause that's how we roll.
- That's how we roll.

09:26.132 --> 09:29.468
Although, I was hoping
to settle for some great casual sex.

09:29.535 --> 09:33.272
- I'm sure Orlando's up for that.
- Yeah, he is, but...

09:34.273 --> 09:37.043
- He's not bringing his A game?
- It's worse than that.

09:37.109 --> 09:40.146
He thinks I'm a freaking bosu ball.
I swear I can hear him counting.

09:40.212 --> 09:41.314
He's like...

09:42.882 --> 09:44.717
I'm like...

09:44.784 --> 09:47.920
Yeah, I know the type.
Stick to the script, homeboy.

09:47.987 --> 09:50.456
Yes, he checks off
all the erogenous zones.

09:50.523 --> 09:53.926
- I got that one! Please.
- Maybe you can teach him a thing or two.

09:53.993 --> 09:55.928
What, school a 34-year-old man?

09:55.995 --> 09:58.397
Please, I ain't got time for that, girl.

09:59.498 --> 10:01.667
You're really gonna
try and make this kid talk?

10:03.569 --> 10:04.670
Look.

10:04.737 --> 10:06.939
My New Jersey teen has role models.

10:07.006 --> 10:09.875
I found his fashion icon. D Razor.

10:09.942 --> 10:12.945
- I'm gonna say rapper.
- Yes.

10:13.012 --> 10:14.246
He has a new fashion line.

10:14.313 --> 10:16.916
It specializes
in traditionally female items,

10:16.983 --> 10:20.219
skirts and camisoles, but for dudes.

10:21.487 --> 10:23.889
You should see me in my kilt.

10:25.424 --> 10:27.393
You have a kilt?

10:27.460 --> 10:30.429
My mother
has an ancestor in the Gunn Clan.

10:31.630 --> 10:32.832
It's a long story.

10:32.898 --> 10:35.701
Still, a kilt.

10:35.768 --> 10:38.938
There is a Puritanical streak
in this country that always amazes me.

10:39.005 --> 10:41.974
No, even my gay friends
are hesitant when it comes to skirts.

10:42.041 --> 10:43.275
Why do we do that?

10:43.342 --> 10:46.178
Question a person's sexual orientation
based on what they wear?

10:47.580 --> 10:49.215
You are different.

10:49.281 --> 10:50.916
I should hope so.

10:53.686 --> 10:57.123
I mean, look at how you're sitting.
You cross your legs like a girl.

10:57.790 --> 11:00.292
Come on. What's wrong
with the way I cross my legs?

11:00.359 --> 11:03.362
Okay, most black men will...

11:03.429 --> 11:07.299
Most American black men,
they spread them wide, right?

11:07.366 --> 11:09.068
They keep those legs wide.

11:09.135 --> 11:12.738
At best, they cross the foot
over the knee.

11:12.805 --> 11:15.408
It still has space for their junk.

11:15.841 --> 11:19.512
You have all this empathy
for this kid who wears skirts,

11:19.578 --> 11:20.780
but, really...

11:20.846 --> 11:23.716
I can feel it's wrong for a boy
to be bullied for wearing skirts,

11:23.783 --> 11:25.718
but it doesn't mean
I want my man wearing them.

11:27.053 --> 11:28.087
Right.

11:31.157 --> 11:32.892
What are you doing?

11:32.958 --> 11:34.493
I'm gonna make a cup of tea.

11:34.560 --> 11:36.228
If that's not too foreign.

11:36.796 --> 11:38.431
Or feminine.

11:39.165 --> 11:41.934
No, it's fine.

11:42.001 --> 11:46.272
<i>Mom, your pose
with Orlando Lagos was so cool.</i>

11:46.338 --> 11:47.973
<i>I showed it to everyone at school.</i>

11:48.040 --> 11:49.942
<i>- Really?
- He's our favorite player.</i>

11:50.009 --> 11:51.710
<i>How do you know him?</i>

11:52.978 --> 11:54.113
He's just a friend.

11:54.180 --> 11:57.316
<i>- Man, I want your job.
- Really, baby?</i>

11:57.383 --> 12:00.252
Because what if you have kids
and you never get to see them?

12:01.620 --> 12:03.155
I miss you guys.

12:03.222 --> 12:04.924
<i>We miss you, too.</i>

12:04.990 --> 12:08.427
<i>So, do we get to meet Orlando
whenever we come to New York?</i>

12:10.362 --> 12:12.932
<i>- Maybe. We'll see.
- Cool.</i>

12:12.998 --> 12:15.267
Why don't you finish
getting ready for school?

12:15.334 --> 12:16.469
<i>- All right.
- I love you.</i>

12:16.535 --> 12:18.437
<i>- We love you.
- Okay. Bye.</i>

12:22.641 --> 12:24.977
They haven't even met you
and they like you already.

12:25.044 --> 12:26.745
- I love kids, too.
- What's that about?

12:28.914 --> 12:30.249
<i>Come here, mami.</i>

12:35.287 --> 12:36.422
What's wrong?

12:40.693 --> 12:42.261
Orlando...

12:43.496 --> 12:47.566
I like you a lot, and you're a lot of fun
to hang out with, really,

12:47.633 --> 12:51.070
but the... physical stuff

12:51.137 --> 12:52.304
is not that much fun.

12:53.172 --> 12:56.709
- Excuse me?
- I mean, the sex is good, you know?

12:56.775 --> 12:58.410
But it can be so much better.

12:58.477 --> 13:01.013
Listen, you've got the perfect body,

13:01.080 --> 13:03.649
and you've got all the equipment
that you need.

13:04.216 --> 13:06.752
- It's just...
- I've never had any complaints before.

13:06.819 --> 13:08.187
Well, of course, you haven't.

13:08.254 --> 13:10.489
You've been screwing
these 23-year-old groupies

13:10.556 --> 13:13.359
and they don't complain
because they don't know any better.

13:13.425 --> 13:15.394
You seriously don't like it.

13:16.395 --> 13:17.463
Listen...

13:19.165 --> 13:21.167
This doesn't have to be
a negative, you know?

13:21.233 --> 13:23.736
- This could be fun.
- Then what is this?

13:23.802 --> 13:27.840
We are gonna work on your technique...

13:28.707 --> 13:29.875
starting with oral.

13:30.409 --> 13:32.811
What, you don't even like
how I go down on you?

13:32.878 --> 13:34.747
Okay, Orlando, wait, wait.

13:34.813 --> 13:36.215
<i>Listen. Papa.</i>

13:39.318 --> 13:42.321
Look, you are a strong man,

13:42.388 --> 13:45.457
and even your tongue,
sometimes it's extra forceful,

13:45.524 --> 13:49.128
and it's not always about
how hard or how fast you go,

13:49.195 --> 13:50.162
you know what I mean?

13:54.133 --> 13:55.634
I have something for you.

13:59.672 --> 14:01.273
Does this remind you of anything?

14:02.107 --> 14:03.309
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

14:04.910 --> 14:05.945
Good.

14:08.280 --> 14:09.815
Because...

14:10.316 --> 14:14.453
I want you to remove this pit

14:14.520 --> 14:18.591
with nothing but your tongue.

14:20.893 --> 14:23.963
Justin, I wanna bring the rapper
D Razor on the show,

14:24.029 --> 14:26.465
and ask him
about the Calhoun Jeffries video.

14:27.132 --> 14:28.968
A rapper talking about a video he saw.

14:29.034 --> 14:30.302
- Yeah.
- That's your angle.

14:30.369 --> 14:33.038
No, what happened
to that kid was child abuse.

14:33.105 --> 14:35.507
Did anyone report it
to Child Protective Services?

14:35.574 --> 14:37.409
No, but they should have.

14:38.510 --> 14:41.580
According to whom?
The idiots who chime in on their phones?

14:41.647 --> 14:44.149
- That's how the internet works.
- I call that mob rule.

14:44.216 --> 14:45.951
And I call that clicks rule.

14:46.018 --> 14:48.921
Whether you like it or not,
social media is news.

14:48.988 --> 14:50.055
Okay.

14:50.122 --> 14:52.725
You see, that's exactly
the kind of thinking

14:52.791 --> 14:54.526
that got us your reality star.

14:55.427 --> 14:58.797
Now you want me to bring on
a crossdressing rapper?

14:58.864 --> 15:00.532
On the morning news?

15:01.934 --> 15:04.169
- No, thanks.
- Wait, wait.

15:04.837 --> 15:06.171
How about we put it to Garrett?

15:07.506 --> 15:08.974
Let him decide.

15:09.041 --> 15:13.045
Hey, Justin, come here. Check this out.
One second. Look at this.

15:13.112 --> 15:15.347
The turnover's killing us. Again.

15:16.282 --> 15:18.384
That defense is looking strong, isn't it?

15:18.450 --> 15:21.854
- I'll come back if it isn't a good time.
- No, go ahead. Pitch.

15:23.188 --> 15:25.858
Okay. So, I was thinking
of bringing in D Razor

15:25.924 --> 15:28.627
and asking him
about that New Jersey teen.

15:28.694 --> 15:29.862
- The rapper?
- Yes.

15:29.928 --> 15:31.530
What happened to landing the kid?

15:31.597 --> 15:35.134
He's proving a little hard to nail down.
But it's my way of reaching out to him.

15:35.200 --> 15:37.670
- You think this'll convince him to talk?
- Maybe.

15:37.736 --> 15:39.605
But, at any rate, it keeps the story hot.

15:40.639 --> 15:42.207
This D Razor.

15:42.274 --> 15:44.209
- He's popular in his own right?
- Yes.

15:45.644 --> 15:47.613
Look, he has a lot of fans, all right,

15:47.680 --> 15:50.683
but you wouldn't be considering him
if it wasn't for this video.

15:50.749 --> 15:53.886
Yeah, and my segment on that video
just surpassed three million hits.

15:53.952 --> 15:55.487
- Three million?
- Yes.

15:56.288 --> 15:58.390
I wasn't expecting that.

15:58.457 --> 16:00.259
I have to agree. I don't want to, but...

16:00.326 --> 16:02.995
- Let's do it.
- Great.

16:04.029 --> 16:07.633
Mary Jane, the next time you two
can't agree on something,

16:07.700 --> 16:09.168
work it out yourselves.

16:10.102 --> 16:11.103
Sure thing.

16:12.871 --> 16:14.006
Camera two, a two-shot.

16:14.073 --> 16:15.974
Hey, Justin, can I talk to you
for a second?

16:16.041 --> 16:19.111
- Yeah.
- Listen, if you hate Mary Jane so much,

16:19.178 --> 16:21.246
why are you maneuvering
to get on her stories?

16:21.313 --> 16:24.750
I don't hate her and I definitely
don't maneuver to get on her stories.

16:24.817 --> 16:26.352
Right. That's a lot of crap.

16:26.418 --> 16:29.788
Because the way you've got this place
wired around here since you arrived,

16:29.855 --> 16:32.858
nobody's gonna force you
into doing something you don't want to.

16:32.925 --> 16:36.328
- Are we done?
- No, actually, I'm not done.

16:36.395 --> 16:40.532
You should know that this charm spell
you've got going with everybody here

16:40.599 --> 16:42.167
is not working on me.

16:43.369 --> 16:44.403
So...

16:46.305 --> 16:48.307
You wanna know what my secret is?

16:48.374 --> 16:50.976
I'm dying to find out. What is it?

16:52.044 --> 16:55.314
I just work harder than everyone else.

16:56.415 --> 17:01.153
- You're a single mom, yeah?
- What does that have to do with anything?

17:01.220 --> 17:05.190
Well, you can never commit
as much as I can.

17:05.257 --> 17:07.393
You and I both know
that the system is rigged,

17:07.459 --> 17:10.262
and it's unfortunate,
but it's harder for you.

17:11.096 --> 17:12.731
That's a fact.

17:13.365 --> 17:17.336
Right, right. You know what?

17:17.403 --> 17:20.105
You might be a hard little worker bee,

17:20.172 --> 17:21.907
but I'm fricking smart.

17:22.574 --> 17:26.979
Yeah. And Mary Jane is special.
Her talent is one of a kind.

17:27.045 --> 17:30.382
But it takes somebody
really smart to bring it out of her.

17:30.449 --> 17:33.886
Like you did at SNC?
Thanks for the advice.

17:33.952 --> 17:35.621
Yeah, I'll be watching out for her.

17:36.555 --> 17:37.723
Pig.

17:39.224 --> 17:40.893
Welcome. Come on in.

17:40.959 --> 17:42.294
- Here you go.
- I got you.

17:42.361 --> 17:43.695
Thank you.

17:43.762 --> 17:46.799
Mary Jane, I'm so glad
that we finally get to meet.

17:47.366 --> 17:49.768
- I'm Olivia.
- It's so nice to meet you.

17:49.835 --> 17:52.204
This is the client
that I've been telling you about.

17:52.271 --> 17:55.974
So, you're the one trying to turn
my brother into a real estate mogul.

17:56.041 --> 17:57.676
We're working on that, aren't we?

17:57.743 --> 17:59.745
- Yes, we are.
- And you must be Lee.

17:59.812 --> 18:02.714
- Such a pleasure to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

18:02.781 --> 18:04.049
- I'll open that.
- Thanks.

18:04.116 --> 18:05.617
- Thank you.
- Come.

18:06.251 --> 18:07.886
Olivia, I'm curious.

18:07.953 --> 18:11.089
How is it that my little brother
got a Rolex after six months?

18:11.156 --> 18:13.826
What do you get when you retire?

18:13.892 --> 18:16.495
You know what they say.
There are two kinds of people,

18:16.562 --> 18:18.464
those that say something about your Rolex

18:18.530 --> 18:20.666
and those that notice,
but don't say anything.

18:20.732 --> 18:23.936
Yes, and we all know
what kind Mary Jane is.

18:24.503 --> 18:27.573
When my parents died,
I knew nothing about the business.

18:27.639 --> 18:29.107
It took me quite a few years

18:29.174 --> 18:32.478
to learn that it's not the financials
that trip up most people.

18:32.544 --> 18:35.848
It's the intangibles,
the invisible barriers.

18:35.914 --> 18:37.950
I know that all too well.

18:38.016 --> 18:41.420
PJ has the most natural talent
that I've ever seen.

18:41.487 --> 18:44.323
He's both intelligent and disarming.

18:44.389 --> 18:47.993
If I were 20 or 25 years younger,

18:48.060 --> 18:49.995
he would have had me in bed long ago.

18:51.263 --> 18:53.532
But I have other plans for him.

18:53.599 --> 18:57.469
I want to break up these exclusive
circles that PJ is shut out of,

18:57.536 --> 19:00.606
bring in someone like him
to open more doors for people of color.

19:00.672 --> 19:01.974
That's commendable.

19:02.040 --> 19:06.345
Still, PJ with a 30 000 dollar Rolex?

19:06.411 --> 19:09.381
People want to see
that you're in or out of the club.

19:09.448 --> 19:11.850
The watch just says that he's one of us.

19:13.352 --> 19:15.521
- To us.
- To us.

19:22.127 --> 19:23.829
I'm kind of stunned.

19:23.896 --> 19:25.097
What do you mean?

19:25.597 --> 19:28.433
Olivia really is PJ's mentor.

19:28.500 --> 19:31.003
What, you still doubted him,
after everything he said?

19:31.069 --> 19:34.172
If you knew my brother,
you'd understand why.

19:34.239 --> 19:35.874
I think he's a lucky guy.

19:37.142 --> 19:40.245
You mean I can relax.
My brother's in a good place.

19:41.780 --> 19:43.982
So it seems, are you.

19:49.488 --> 19:52.224
Okay, okay, stop, stop, no.

19:52.291 --> 19:53.325
What?

19:54.026 --> 19:56.361
You're just trying too hard.

19:56.428 --> 19:57.963
Sorry.

19:58.997 --> 20:01.199
Maybe I should find somebody
who likes what I do.

20:01.266 --> 20:03.302
No, come on, papi. No, no, no.

20:03.368 --> 20:04.970
Listen to me. Stop.

20:06.071 --> 20:07.940
You're just overthinking it.

20:08.006 --> 20:10.175
You know, you're concentrating too much.

20:10.242 --> 20:13.712
- But I wanna give you your pleasure.
- I know. I know.

20:14.212 --> 20:18.717
But in order to do that,
you've got to lose yourself in the flow,

20:18.784 --> 20:21.720
like you do in baseball, okay?

20:22.788 --> 20:26.024
It's not just you doing things to me.

20:26.091 --> 20:29.061
It's back and forth, all right?

20:29.127 --> 20:30.262
Yeah.

20:30.329 --> 20:32.731
Let's try it again. Come on.

20:35.667 --> 20:36.835
Give me your hand.

20:40.205 --> 20:42.474
Yes. Yes.

20:45.277 --> 20:46.378
Yes...

20:51.216 --> 20:53.051
- What's wrong?
- I can't.

20:54.019 --> 20:55.687
Okay.

20:55.754 --> 20:57.889
Okay, listen to me.
Let's just slow this down.

20:57.956 --> 20:59.091
No, just stop.

20:59.157 --> 21:01.560
- Just stop.
- Let's slow down. Why?

21:11.637 --> 21:14.072
- Hi.
- How'd it go with Justin?

21:14.139 --> 21:15.574
I said what I had to say.

21:17.275 --> 21:20.779
Is that the leftover food
from our dinner?

21:23.148 --> 21:26.351
Girl, this is so amazing, honestly.

21:26.418 --> 21:29.388
- You've to get your own kitchen, quick.
- I'm working on it.

21:29.655 --> 21:31.556
And Lee is so amazing, too.

21:31.623 --> 21:32.824
No.

21:32.891 --> 21:36.428
No, no, no, please don't...
don't ruin my illusion.

21:36.495 --> 21:38.697
I need my vicarious orgasms right now.

21:38.764 --> 21:40.799
It's not that. It's just...

21:41.400 --> 21:45.971
He lacks that... swagger,
you know what I mean?

21:46.038 --> 21:47.572
So, he's a little on the soft side.

21:47.639 --> 21:49.107
He's like a big, sexy teddy bear.

21:49.174 --> 21:50.709
You know I'm not used to that.

21:51.743 --> 21:54.479
Mary Jane, you make up
these imaginary problems.

21:54.546 --> 21:57.049
No. Seriously, though,
seriously, though...

21:57.482 --> 22:00.419
How metro is too metro?

22:00.485 --> 22:02.487
- Because I think he's it.
- I don't know.

22:03.455 --> 22:04.823
But I do know this.

22:04.890 --> 22:07.759
You are so fired as a sex therapist.

22:08.326 --> 22:09.494
- The ball player?
- Yes.

22:09.561 --> 22:10.896
- You took my advice?
- Yes.

22:10.962 --> 22:13.465
And that boy got up
out of my bed and called an Uber.

22:13.532 --> 22:15.967
- All right?
- That's gotta be tough on the ego.

22:16.034 --> 22:18.704
Yeah, no kidding. Now I don't know
if I'll ever see him again,

22:18.770 --> 22:21.239
which really sucks,
because having Orlando around

22:21.306 --> 22:24.776
was working wonders on Garrett,
he was finally starting to listen to me.

22:24.843 --> 22:26.445
Now I'm back to zero.

22:27.746 --> 22:29.448
- Check it out.
- What?

22:30.582 --> 22:35.187
- He's got their full attention.
- Yeah, but I don't think he's flirting.

22:35.253 --> 22:37.255
I think he's recruiting
the hell outta this.

22:37.322 --> 22:39.558
He's even got the boys in his corner.

22:39.624 --> 22:42.160
And now he's working on the women.

22:42.227 --> 22:45.597
Everything that man does is strategic.

22:45.664 --> 22:48.266
I'm just having reservations
about it all.

22:48.333 --> 22:50.435
Reservations? About my story?

22:52.270 --> 22:53.505
Garrett approved it.

22:53.572 --> 22:55.440
I'm aware of that.

22:55.507 --> 22:57.442
Men like D Razor, you put them on,

22:57.509 --> 23:00.445
we are essentially coming down
in favor of their lifestyle.

23:00.512 --> 23:02.013
Ronda, what are you trying to say?

23:02.814 --> 23:05.350
Kids watch this show, black kids,

23:05.417 --> 23:08.153
many of whom don't have
positive role models at home.

23:08.220 --> 23:10.889
I'm concerned that it's our duty
to put forth

23:10.956 --> 23:13.592
positive images of black masculinity,

23:13.658 --> 23:16.628
and with these young men,
they don't exactly do that.

23:17.129 --> 23:19.464
I don't have a problem giving him a mic.

23:19.531 --> 23:21.867
I'm more concerned that this rapper

23:21.933 --> 23:24.970
is gonna portray this kid
in the viral video as a victim.

23:25.904 --> 23:28.006
And how is he not a victim?

23:28.807 --> 23:29.908
Okay.

23:29.975 --> 23:32.177
You wanna know what I see on that tape?

23:32.244 --> 23:35.914
A father protecting his son.
Let's just be real.

23:35.981 --> 23:38.250
If you wanna be that different
around black people,

23:38.750 --> 23:40.919
you've gotta be prepared
to take a few knocks.

23:40.986 --> 23:44.689
Funny, Justin, I don't recall you
talking this tough in the story meeting.

23:44.756 --> 23:47.025
You know why, Mary Jane.

23:47.092 --> 23:49.795
Garrett's not one to pick up
on the subtleties.

23:51.329 --> 23:54.900
Okay, is either one of you
going to tell Garrett that he's wrong?

23:55.767 --> 23:58.970
No? Right. I didn't think so.

23:59.037 --> 24:01.673
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have a story to prepare.

24:08.213 --> 24:10.215
D Razor, everyone watching here today

24:10.282 --> 24:13.285
sees a man wearing women's clothes.

24:13.351 --> 24:16.454
- What do you want them to think about it?
- That I'm fabulous.

24:16.521 --> 24:17.722
You certainly are.

24:17.789 --> 24:19.825
See, here's the thing, Mary Jane...

24:20.425 --> 24:22.027
the youth is more open-minded.

24:22.928 --> 24:24.162
Okay? We don't care.

24:24.229 --> 24:27.799
Like me, I'm a male who wears
skirts and dresses. So what?

24:27.866 --> 24:30.202
What about the influence
that you have on kids?

24:30.268 --> 24:32.904
Kids that don't have your wealth or fame,

24:32.971 --> 24:35.407
but wanna emulate your flamboyant style.

24:35.473 --> 24:36.975
You're talking about the video.

24:37.042 --> 24:38.910
- You saw it?
- Of course.

24:38.977 --> 24:42.147
Let's take a moment to show
our viewers the viral video.

24:42.214 --> 24:44.049
<i>It's okay.</i>

24:51.056 --> 24:54.192
The young man was assaulted
for wearing your clothes.

24:54.259 --> 24:55.994
What would you like to say to him?

24:56.561 --> 24:58.163
I would say that...

24:58.930 --> 25:01.533
we need to call out
the person that did that.

25:02.367 --> 25:05.070
We need to make sure
that it never happens again.

25:07.973 --> 25:09.774
What are you doing here?

25:10.275 --> 25:13.645
I didn't expect you to be back.
Quite frankly, I...

25:13.712 --> 25:15.747
October 19th, 2010.

25:16.514 --> 25:18.783
Okay. What happened?

25:18.850 --> 25:20.552
The greatest play of my career.

25:21.519 --> 25:22.921
The ball shoots up the middle.

25:22.988 --> 25:25.156
If it gets past me, Philly scores.

25:25.223 --> 25:26.725
We don't get to the World Series.

25:26.791 --> 25:28.526
- Okay.
- I laid out for that one.

25:28.593 --> 25:31.129
Popped up, still made that double play.

25:31.196 --> 25:33.531
- It was my first pennant win.
- Good for you! Wow!

25:33.598 --> 25:34.900
Congratulations!

25:34.966 --> 25:37.669
- I'm saying, if I can do all that...
- Yeah?

25:37.736 --> 25:40.005
I can master all this.

25:40.071 --> 25:41.206
Wait a minute.

25:41.273 --> 25:45.510
Okay. We need to set
some ground rules first, okay?

25:46.244 --> 25:47.812
You need to slow it down.

25:47.879 --> 25:50.916
- All right.
- No, no, listen to me.

25:53.184 --> 25:55.954
Before you step up to home plate
to bat, what do you do?

25:57.489 --> 25:59.791
- Warm up?
- Exactly.

26:00.558 --> 26:03.695
<i>Same rules apply here, papi.
You've gotta warm up.</i>

26:04.129 --> 26:05.897
And take it slow,

26:05.964 --> 26:08.199
you know, just relax.

26:09.034 --> 26:11.236
And we have to ease into it...

26:13.405 --> 26:17.275
- Okay?
- Yeah. Okay.

26:23.248 --> 26:24.883
Nice and slow.

26:30.021 --> 26:32.824
Now that was nice.

26:44.002 --> 26:45.637
Not yet. Not yet.

26:46.404 --> 26:47.505
Not yet.

26:47.572 --> 26:50.108
I'm trying to get you in control.

26:50.175 --> 26:52.477
You mean like the zone?

26:52.544 --> 26:54.079
Whatever you wanna call it.

26:54.145 --> 26:56.014
Can I call it the zone?

26:56.081 --> 26:57.716
You can call it the zone.

27:05.357 --> 27:06.725
Yeah.

27:14.799 --> 27:16.601
Look at me.

27:17.502 --> 27:19.938
No, no, honey.

27:21.840 --> 27:23.041
Really look at me.

27:47.298 --> 27:48.633
Yes!

27:52.971 --> 27:54.072
My God.

27:55.874 --> 27:57.208
My God...

27:58.410 --> 27:59.744
Do you like basketball?

27:59.811 --> 28:01.846
- Yeah.
- They're pretty nice seats.

28:01.913 --> 28:04.182
Yeah, these are great seats.

28:04.249 --> 28:06.317
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

28:08.053 --> 28:10.889
- So, would you wanna go?
- Is Natalie falling for it, too?

28:11.589 --> 28:14.459
Girl, she's got two tickets
to the Knick's game tonight,

28:14.526 --> 28:16.995
and she's trying to see
if she can get him to bite.

28:17.495 --> 28:20.231
- These are great seats.
- Yeah?

28:20.298 --> 28:22.867
He paused. That's not a good sign.

28:22.934 --> 28:25.170
Yeah, a pause is always no.

28:25.236 --> 28:28.073
I have to admit
this is oddly therapeutic.

28:29.474 --> 28:30.542
Okay.

28:30.608 --> 28:32.510
Natalie? Nat?

28:32.577 --> 28:33.778
How'd it go?

28:33.845 --> 28:36.815
Great. Justin definitely
wants to see the Knicks play.

28:36.881 --> 28:38.650
But he wants to bring his girlfriend.

28:38.716 --> 28:40.385
Girlfriend?

28:40.452 --> 28:42.554
He offered to buy the tickets off me.

28:42.620 --> 28:44.789
Girl, I'm sorry.

28:44.856 --> 28:46.458
What'd you say?

28:46.524 --> 28:48.126
I sold them to him...

28:48.193 --> 28:49.461
for twice what I paid.

28:49.527 --> 28:50.829
Good girl.

28:50.895 --> 28:53.298
You know what, though,
Natalie, it's not even you.

28:53.364 --> 28:55.133
I'm sure he prefers White women.

28:55.200 --> 28:58.169
- You think?
- It's always the case with these guys.

28:58.236 --> 29:01.573
A registered Republican,
political climber.

29:01.639 --> 29:03.775
Damn sure he's probably dating Becky.

29:14.519 --> 29:15.820
Olivia, hi.

29:15.887 --> 29:19.023
It was so great to meet
your sister the other day, PJ.

29:19.090 --> 29:21.159
She really shines in person,

29:21.226 --> 29:22.560
not just on TV.

29:22.627 --> 29:24.696
Thank you. I'll let her know you said so.

29:24.762 --> 29:26.164
<i>- Listen, I need a favor.
- Sure.</i>

29:26.231 --> 29:29.134
My daughter Ava is driving down
from Vassar tonight.

29:29.534 --> 29:32.237
She'll be looking
into some internship opportunities.

29:32.303 --> 29:34.906
- Could you sit down with her?
- Sure, I'd love to help her.

29:34.973 --> 29:36.908
Ava has a good head on her shoulders,

29:36.975 --> 29:38.276
but she's young.

29:38.343 --> 29:40.311
I get it. Not a problem at all.

29:40.378 --> 29:42.714
<i>- Thank you.
- I'll talk to you soon.</i>

29:46.551 --> 29:48.786
Any luck getting the Jersey kid?

29:50.121 --> 29:51.389
Okay, look.

29:53.491 --> 29:56.694
You know I'm not a fan for this story,
but the fact is, it's blowing up,

29:56.761 --> 29:58.830
and if you don't deliver,
you'll screw us both.

29:58.897 --> 30:00.131
I'm working on it.

30:00.198 --> 30:02.333
- Okay. Working on it?
- Yeah.

30:03.801 --> 30:05.503
Why are you still here, then?

30:06.204 --> 30:07.705
Excuse me?

30:07.772 --> 30:10.675
You said you were gonna talk to him.
You'd find him and talk to him.

30:10.742 --> 30:12.210
So, let's go, it's show time.

30:12.277 --> 30:14.479
I have tried many times.

30:14.546 --> 30:16.080
Okay.

30:17.081 --> 30:19.784
So, your big plan
with the rapper doesn't work out.

30:19.851 --> 30:21.619
What are you gonna do now?

30:42.974 --> 30:46.177
Ava, hey. I'm Paul.
Let me help you with that.

30:46.711 --> 30:48.880
Your mom wanted me
to make sure you got in okay.

30:48.947 --> 30:50.248
How's everything?

30:50.315 --> 30:52.317
I'm not Ava, I'm Kristy.

30:52.383 --> 30:53.785
This is Ava.

30:56.487 --> 30:58.456
- Hey, Paul.
- Hi.

30:58.523 --> 31:01.659
Mom didn't tell me
my new babysitter would be so cute.

31:04.696 --> 31:06.397
Boy...

31:11.769 --> 31:14.138
Calhoun? Hey, Calhoun?

31:14.205 --> 31:16.374
I'm Mary Jane Paul from "Great Day USA."

31:16.441 --> 31:18.810
I know who you are and why you're here.

31:18.876 --> 31:21.279
Wait. I have a message from D Razor.

31:21.346 --> 31:24.916
Yeah, he felt for your situation
and he wants to meet you in person.

31:24.983 --> 31:26.184
He said that?

31:26.251 --> 31:28.253
And we can make it happen
if you come on our show.

31:29.621 --> 31:33.091
- I don't know.
- It would mean so much to so many people

31:33.157 --> 31:35.193
with gay-bashing on the rise.

31:35.260 --> 31:38.763
That's right. Because I wear skirts,
all right, I must be gay, right?

31:38.830 --> 31:40.298
- No, that's not...
- It's cool.

31:40.365 --> 31:43.468
A lot of people make that assumption.
My dad does.

31:44.235 --> 31:45.570
So, you don't identify as gay.

31:46.904 --> 31:51.276
Clothes don't make you gay
any more than they make you straight.

31:51.342 --> 31:54.178
And why should what I wear affect you?

31:54.245 --> 31:57.348
- Why should you even care?
- Exactly.

31:57.415 --> 32:00.852
That's why you should come
on "Great Day USA" and tell America that.

32:00.918 --> 32:02.854
What the hell is going on here?

32:02.920 --> 32:05.523
Mr. Jeffries,
I was just talking to Calhoun...

32:05.590 --> 32:07.892
You have exactly ten seconds
to get off my property.

32:07.959 --> 32:11.062
Look, I have reporters
knocking on my door every day

32:11.129 --> 32:12.997
accusing me of all manners of things.

32:13.064 --> 32:16.301
I'm just trying to protect
my son the best way I know how.

32:16.367 --> 32:19.203
I cannot have him walking
up and down this neighborhood

32:19.270 --> 32:20.838
dressed like a damn freak.

32:20.905 --> 32:24.709
- Your son is not a freak.
- You don't know a thing about my son.

32:24.776 --> 32:26.878
You just wanna turn him
into a media spectacle.

32:26.944 --> 32:30.114
But what happens when the cameras leave
and you move on to your next story?

32:32.250 --> 32:35.186
No, my son's not doing no damn
interview and that's that. Come on.

32:35.253 --> 32:37.088
You're wrong, Dad.

32:39.123 --> 32:40.525
I am doing it.

32:41.359 --> 32:44.162
So, you're man enough to tell me
what you're gonna do now?

32:44.629 --> 32:47.198
So what? What if I beat you down?

32:47.265 --> 32:49.233
Then I'll have your respect?

32:49.300 --> 32:50.835
You'll be proud of me then, right?

32:52.470 --> 32:54.539
Look, if that's what it's gonna take,

32:54.605 --> 32:57.108
then come on, I'm ready.

33:13.124 --> 33:15.727
It's okay.

33:21.299 --> 33:24.335
Hold on. Not yet. Not yet.

33:24.402 --> 33:25.970
- Boy...
- Not yet.

33:31.142 --> 33:32.543
Wait.

33:33.010 --> 33:34.812
Wait a minute.

33:34.879 --> 33:37.248
My God, what are you doing?

33:40.451 --> 33:41.552
Yeah.

33:52.463 --> 33:53.531
My God.

33:55.433 --> 33:57.602
I can't even focus my eyes.

33:58.870 --> 34:00.638
That was record for me.

34:01.372 --> 34:03.641
You can't tell me you didn't enjoy that.

34:05.343 --> 34:07.111
I utterly...

34:07.712 --> 34:09.247
enjoyed that.

34:11.482 --> 34:12.950
No complaints here.

34:14.318 --> 34:17.155
- No? No complaints?
- That was amazing.

34:17.221 --> 34:19.557
- Finally.
- God.

34:26.230 --> 34:27.665
What's up?

34:27.732 --> 34:29.600
- What are you thinking about?
- Nothing.

34:30.735 --> 34:35.473
Nothing. I was just thinking
about a story I have to prepare for.

34:35.873 --> 34:37.675
You were?

34:37.742 --> 34:39.510
You're thinking about work right now?

34:39.577 --> 34:41.646
I'm sorry.

34:41.712 --> 34:43.114
About work?

34:43.181 --> 34:45.049
You're thinking about work right now?

34:45.116 --> 34:47.318
No, cut it out. Stop.

34:47.385 --> 34:48.953
What are you...? Stop.

34:49.020 --> 34:50.721
- Put me down.
- Thinking about work?

34:52.089 --> 34:54.826
- You thinking about work right now?
- No.

34:56.160 --> 34:58.329
Here we go.

35:03.935 --> 35:05.269
Okay.

35:06.504 --> 35:07.672
Okay.

35:09.407 --> 35:11.275
What? What?

35:11.342 --> 35:13.711
- What's the matter?
- I can't move my neck.

35:13.778 --> 35:15.813
- My God.
- I can't move my neck.

35:22.487 --> 35:24.689
- Hey.
- What are we gonna do about this?

35:25.389 --> 35:26.591
What?

35:26.657 --> 35:27.992
Orlando's neck.

35:29.160 --> 35:30.962
I know. Right?

35:31.028 --> 35:32.497
Poor guy. I know.

35:32.563 --> 35:35.066
They say he'll miss
the start of spring training.

35:35.132 --> 35:37.268
My God, I didn't know
it was that serious.

35:38.603 --> 35:40.404
How the heck did he do it?

35:41.839 --> 35:45.910
I mean, I...
I think he was trying to show off,

35:45.977 --> 35:48.713
trying to play football with friends
or something like that.

35:48.779 --> 35:51.782
Well, tell him to be more careful,
for Christ's sake.

35:51.849 --> 35:53.885
Yeah, I will. I will.

36:02.693 --> 36:06.230
Calhoun, gotta say... loving the outfit.

36:06.297 --> 36:07.999
Thank you. It's D Razor all the way.

36:08.065 --> 36:09.367
He was my stylist for today.

36:09.433 --> 36:14.171
D Razor, he's on record as saying
that clothes don't make you gay.

36:14.238 --> 36:16.107
- What do you think about that?
- He's right.

36:16.807 --> 36:19.844
What I'm wearing
doesn't determine my sexuality.

36:19.911 --> 36:23.347
So, is it tough to find
like-minded peers at school?

36:23.414 --> 36:26.517
Yeah, but I use
social media as an outlet,

36:26.584 --> 36:28.419
you know, like, I share my looks,

36:28.486 --> 36:30.621
and I get ideas, too.

36:30.688 --> 36:34.792
It's kinda like where I find
my community, I guess.

36:34.859 --> 36:36.127
Speaking of community,

36:36.193 --> 36:39.730
what's been the reaction
to your clothes at school?

36:39.797 --> 36:40.998
How do the kids treat you?

36:42.199 --> 36:45.469
I get teased and roughed up a lot.

36:45.536 --> 36:48.973
But I don't know, I feel like
for every kid who picks on me,

36:49.040 --> 36:50.641
or roughs me up,

36:51.309 --> 36:54.779
there are like two or three more
who defend me, I guess.

36:54.845 --> 36:56.547
How does it feel
when they defend you?

36:56.614 --> 37:00.318
It feels good to be accepted,
you know? Because...

37:01.352 --> 37:03.888
I don't deserve to go through
the things that I go through

37:03.955 --> 37:05.323
because of what I wear.

37:05.389 --> 37:08.059
So, you know, when someone

37:08.125 --> 37:10.428
is bold enough to step forward

37:10.494 --> 37:12.897
and defend me
because I'm human, it's just...

37:12.964 --> 37:16.500
It feels better than the things
I experience every day, I guess.

37:16.567 --> 37:19.470
Can you imagine having to deal
with this abuse all day at school

37:20.071 --> 37:22.707
and coming home and getting
an extra dose from your father?

37:25.076 --> 37:28.079
My father dropped
a lot of hard shoots on me, too.

37:28.813 --> 37:30.047
It must have been tough.

37:32.216 --> 37:33.718
I've got no regrets.

37:35.620 --> 37:37.188
I'm not a victim.

37:37.254 --> 37:38.556
I'm a winner.

37:39.090 --> 37:40.458
It made me a stronger person.

37:49.000 --> 37:52.236
I have courtside seats
to the game this evening.

37:54.939 --> 37:57.008
- Hey.
- Hey.

37:59.477 --> 38:01.946
I'm so happy to get outta here.

38:03.114 --> 38:05.683
I hope you don't mind me
dropping in on you like this.

38:05.750 --> 38:08.519
<i>No, papi, sure. Come on in and sit down.</i>

38:09.720 --> 38:11.856
I'm so worried about your neck.

38:11.922 --> 38:14.725
I'm sorry. Does it hurt?

38:14.792 --> 38:16.527
It'll slow me down a bit.

38:18.029 --> 38:21.332
I know I can't perform
like I used to, but...

38:22.533 --> 38:24.235
I was hoping...

38:26.237 --> 38:27.738
What?

38:28.439 --> 38:31.742
I was hoping that maybe
you'd wanna just hang out.

38:33.010 --> 38:34.378
That's so sweet.

38:34.445 --> 38:35.746
Is that okay?

38:37.348 --> 38:41.285
Yeah. Of course. Sure, we can hang out.

38:44.388 --> 38:46.390
We can hang out.

38:46.457 --> 38:47.558
<i>Offers of support</i>

38:47.625 --> 38:50.795
<i>continue to pour in for New Jersey
teenager, Calhoun Jeffries...</i>

38:50.861 --> 38:53.531
Man, oh, man, that Calhoun interview.

38:55.800 --> 38:57.068
You watch me?

38:57.134 --> 38:58.769
It's my way of keeping tabs on you.

38:58.836 --> 39:00.304
Right.

39:00.905 --> 39:04.341
Without you, none of this
would have seen the light of day.

39:06.143 --> 39:07.511
Probably not.

39:07.945 --> 39:09.146
Seriously...

39:09.213 --> 39:10.614
a great story.

39:11.248 --> 39:12.349
Thanks.

39:14.085 --> 39:16.821
- Tea?
- Come on.

39:16.887 --> 39:18.889
Mary Jane. What?

39:19.356 --> 39:20.925
Just because I drink tea,

39:20.991 --> 39:23.761
cross my legs funny,
and wear skinny jeans,

39:23.828 --> 39:25.529
which all the guys do, by the way,

39:26.163 --> 39:27.531
doesn't make me any less of a man.

39:28.432 --> 39:29.900
I know. It's just...

39:30.835 --> 39:33.304
I wish sometimes
you'd dial it back a little.

39:33.370 --> 39:34.405
Right.

39:34.472 --> 39:37.274
Because you're used to dating those...

39:37.341 --> 39:39.610
thuggish, muscular, tattooed dudes

39:39.677 --> 39:41.312
who are straight out of '90s rap video.

39:42.680 --> 39:45.449
Well... if that's what you're after,

39:46.450 --> 39:47.685
I'm not your guy.

39:47.752 --> 39:49.220
I know.

39:50.054 --> 39:51.455
I've gotta wrap my head around it.

39:51.989 --> 39:53.958
Didn't you learn anything
from your story?

39:54.024 --> 39:57.528
Apart from the fact that skirts
and leggings make a great combo.

39:57.595 --> 39:59.964
Yes, I did, I did.

40:01.065 --> 40:02.399
And you're right.

40:02.466 --> 40:06.837
But self-knowledge
is just the first step to enlightenment.

40:08.172 --> 40:09.240
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

40:09.306 --> 40:11.008
Yeah.

40:15.513 --> 40:19.049
Okay, babe. I'm gonna show you
how to drink tea like a real man.

40:19.116 --> 40:20.718
God.
