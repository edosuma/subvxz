And if the answer is yes, boom,
you're on your way. [Clicks tongue]

09:39.555 --> 09:40.789
Lunch truck.

09:40.823 --> 09:42.457
You know we serve food
here at the store.

09:42.491 --> 09:44.459
I know. That's why I brought my own.

09:44.493 --> 09:47.529
And I got all of your favorites.

09:47.563 --> 09:49.531
No dessert, 'cause you
have to stay slim and trim.

09:49.565 --> 09:51.175
[Scoffs] Mom.

09:51.195 --> 09:52.706
Did you see this?

09:52.726 --> 09:54.936
That guy who yelled at me is on page 33,

09:54.970 --> 09:56.738
the one who hired you... Michael.

09:56.772 --> 09:59.440
Hey, that's the house
I was gonna design.

09:59.475 --> 10:01.476
And that is definitely my lamp.

10:01.510 --> 10:04.145
He's cute.

10:04.180 --> 10:06.214
A financial wiz?

10:06.248 --> 10:08.383
Honey, why didn't you finish this job?

10:08.417 --> 10:10.388
This house is so...

10:10.987 --> 10:13.421
What? I'm on my break.

10:13.455 --> 10:15.283
Break's over.

10:16.425 --> 10:17.892
So?

10:17.927 --> 10:19.561
It just didn't work out.

10:19.595 --> 10:22.263
Oh... you got fired.

10:22.298 --> 10:24.766
I did not get fired.

10:24.800 --> 10:26.632
He kissed me, okay?

10:26.652 --> 10:29.170
It was just a whole awkward,
uncomfortable thing.

10:29.205 --> 10:31.406
Well, now that you're single,
you should call him.

10:31.440 --> 10:33.474
[Chuckles] It's not that simple.

10:33.509 --> 10:35.918
Well, it seems simple enough to me.

10:36.305 --> 10:38.780
- He's transgender.
- What?

10:38.814 --> 10:41.282
- He's transgender.
- What?!

10:41.317 --> 10:43.000
Michael is transgender,

10:43.020 --> 10:45.987
and he didn't tell me at first,
so it just got all weird.

10:46.021 --> 10:47.589
Transgender?

10:47.623 --> 10:49.290
Really?

10:49.325 --> 10:51.593
- He was a woman?
- Yes.

10:51.627 --> 10:53.628
And you knew it, and you
still worked with him?

10:53.662 --> 10:54.762
Would you lower your voice?

10:54.797 --> 10:57.298
There are customers around,
and you are being offensive.

10:57.333 --> 10:58.132
I'm being offensive?

10:58.399 --> 11:00.100
I mean, what is the world coming to?

11:00.134 --> 11:02.450
And please tell me
why these people think

11:02.470 --> 11:04.771
they can flaunt themselves
in front of everybody

11:04.805 --> 11:06.606
and we all have to accept it?

11:06.640 --> 11:08.708
I mean, you know what?
I take back what I said.

11:08.742 --> 11:11.544
I thank God that
you got out of this mess.

11:11.579 --> 11:12.679
Okay, stop!

11:12.713 --> 11:14.547
You do not have to have an opinion

11:14.582 --> 11:15.915
about absolutely everything in my life.

11:15.950 --> 11:18.218
First, Marc, Lucy, now Michael.

11:18.252 --> 11:20.520
I am a judge. It is my
job to have an opinion.

11:20.554 --> 11:23.556
And my opinion is that's unnatural.

11:23.591 --> 11:25.892
[Whispering] Quiet.
You are making a scene.

11:25.926 --> 11:27.480
What?

11:28.629 --> 11:31.064
[Whispering] I'm sorry. It's L.A.

11:31.098 --> 11:33.066
Anything goes.

11:33.100 --> 11:35.301
Let's just eat in peace.

11:35.336 --> 11:36.736
[Sighs]

11:38.846 --> 11:40.192
What do you think?

11:40.212 --> 11:41.374
They're nice.

11:41.408 --> 11:43.443
They bring out the color in your eyes.

11:43.477 --> 11:45.712
So, where's Adam taking you
to dinner tonight?

11:45.746 --> 11:47.814
I think he said Italian.

11:47.848 --> 11:49.109
Oh. That's nice.

11:49.129 --> 11:51.751
I need a minute alone
to finish dressing. Do you mind?

11:51.785 --> 11:53.820
Of course not.

11:53.854 --> 11:55.421
Let me know when Adam gets here.

11:55.456 --> 11:57.123
I will.

12:04.220 --> 12:06.430
Well, it was a really nice
service, you know?

12:06.450 --> 12:07.951
I didn't know that much about her.

12:07.985 --> 12:10.420
I still can't believe that she's gone.

12:10.454 --> 12:13.047
Well, at least they arrested
that scumbag that did it.

12:13.067 --> 12:14.925
Oh, yeah, that reminds me.

12:14.959 --> 12:18.156
The police, they, uh...
They want to talk to you.

12:18.429 --> 12:20.497
To me? Why?

12:20.531 --> 12:22.570
Well, actually,
they want to talk to all of us.

12:22.590 --> 12:23.934
They're building their case against Lee,

12:23.968 --> 12:25.502
but they're coming up thin on evidence.

12:25.536 --> 12:27.571
They need all the help
that they can get.

12:27.605 --> 12:29.406
Yeah, Jackie, I didn't know
Marisol all that well.

12:29.440 --> 12:30.807
I don't know what good I would do.

12:30.842 --> 12:33.027
Hey, every bit is useful.

12:33.047 --> 12:35.345
Joss, you know
what domestic violence is like.

12:35.379 --> 12:37.379
It's like anything they can do
to blame the victim,

12:37.903 --> 12:39.214
they'll do.

12:43.487 --> 12:44.521
Hey, Lydia.

12:44.555 --> 12:45.922
Hi, Adam.

12:45.957 --> 12:47.424
- How you doing?
- Good, thank you.

12:47.458 --> 12:48.801
Those are beautiful.

12:48.821 --> 12:51.361
- Thank you.
- I'm sure Karen is gonna love them.

12:51.395 --> 12:52.632
Is she ready yet?

12:52.652 --> 12:54.698
Uh, she'll be down in a minute.

12:55.661 --> 12:56.600
There you go.

12:56.634 --> 12:58.001
- So cute.
- Nice. [Laughs]

12:58.035 --> 12:59.302
Yeah, I'll take those.

12:59.337 --> 13:00.704
Oh, I like your Barcelona shirt.

13:00.738 --> 13:02.505
Oh. Thanks.

13:02.540 --> 13:04.474
I've never been. I'm just a big fan.

13:04.508 --> 13:06.877
I lived there for two years,
saw a whole bunch of soccer games.

13:06.911 --> 13:09.880
[Chuckles] Is the city
as romantic as they say?

13:09.914 --> 13:11.648
Oh, definitely.

13:12.389 --> 13:15.518
Lydia, I thought you were gonna
tell me when Adam got here.

13:15.553 --> 13:16.519
- Hi.
- Hey.

13:16.554 --> 13:17.988
- Mm.
- Oh, sorry.

13:18.022 --> 13:20.624
I was just getting, um,
a vase for the flowers.

13:20.658 --> 13:21.725
Good night, Vivian.

13:21.759 --> 13:23.526
All right. Ready to go?

13:23.561 --> 13:26.396
Yeah. You look amazing, by the way.

13:26.430 --> 13:27.864
Thank you.

13:33.680 --> 13:35.318
[Vivian fusses]

13:35.686 --> 13:36.840
How you doing? [Door closes]

13:36.874 --> 13:38.541
You need a little diaper change?

13:38.576 --> 13:42.379
Hope you're not getting sick again.

13:42.413 --> 13:47.017
Let's hope that your mommy isn't
having that good of a time,

13:47.051 --> 13:51.521
because we don't want her
finding out what I did, do we?

13:51.555 --> 13:53.857
No. That wouldn't be very good.

13:53.891 --> 13:56.459
Jackie: Okay.

13:57.295 --> 13:58.862
Why haven't you changed yet?

13:58.896 --> 14:00.597
Uh, you know, I'm just not in the mood.

14:00.631 --> 14:02.532
Come on. It'll be good for you.

14:04.268 --> 14:05.368
Uh, I don't... I don't think

14:05.403 --> 14:07.737
that I can talk to the police
about Marisol, Jackie.

14:07.772 --> 14:09.706
It's important, Joss.

14:12.043 --> 14:13.710
- Josslyn Carver...
- [Handcuffs click]

14:13.744 --> 14:17.047
you are under arrest
for the murder of Luca Raines.

14:17.081 --> 14:18.921
[Camera shutter clicking]

14:19.264 --> 14:21.117
Look, I... You know,
I-I told you, right?

14:21.152 --> 14:22.552
Sh-Sh-She and I, I don't know,
we weren't...

14:22.586 --> 14:23.687
We weren't close friends.

14:23.721 --> 14:24.888
I only knew her from class, so...

14:24.922 --> 14:28.525
Look, the more people we get
to establish a pattern of abuse,

14:28.559 --> 14:29.759
the better.

14:31.729 --> 14:34.464
Will you at least consider it?

14:34.498 --> 14:36.099
For me?

14:36.133 --> 14:37.200
Please?

14:37.234 --> 14:38.802
Yeah, okay. I'll think about it.

14:38.836 --> 14:40.203
[Cell door slams]

14:44.835 --> 14:46.753
What? Do I seem like the kind of girl

14:46.788 --> 14:49.433
who wants to spend her vacation
on a boat the whole time?

14:49.453 --> 14:51.320
Well, now that you mention it,

14:51.355 --> 14:54.082
I am seeing you
a little more room service,

14:54.102 --> 14:55.403
Four Seasons, right?

14:55.437 --> 14:57.939
Mm! Now you're speaking my language.

14:57.973 --> 14:59.841
[Laughs]

14:59.875 --> 15:02.210
So, what else should we talk about?

15:02.244 --> 15:03.945
Stop it. I know what you're doing.

15:03.979 --> 15:07.248
I know I said I don't want
to talk about the book pages,

15:07.282 --> 15:08.916
but I lied. I do.

15:08.951 --> 15:10.718
I love them.

15:10.752 --> 15:11.977
Really?

15:11.997 --> 15:14.622
I thought it all might be
a little too dry.

15:14.656 --> 15:16.791
Are you kidding?
No. I want to read more.

15:16.825 --> 15:18.226
Wait. Are you just being nice

15:18.260 --> 15:19.961
because you don't want to
hurt my feelings?

15:19.995 --> 15:22.311
Uh, I don't think I'm being that nice.

15:22.663 --> 15:26.720
In my opinion, there's only
one thing left for you to do.

15:27.001 --> 15:28.035
What?

15:28.070 --> 15:31.231
Fall in love with a man
who's truly available to you.

15:32.565 --> 15:35.838
But hell, where are you gonna
find a guy like that?

15:37.613 --> 15:38.746
I want to know more,

15:38.780 --> 15:40.414
and I want to move to the next level.

15:40.449 --> 15:42.550
I know you said you wanted
to take things slow.

15:42.584 --> 15:46.843
What? I never said anything about
wanting to take things slow.

15:47.189 --> 15:49.385
Yeah, you did, when we
first started talking.

15:49.405 --> 15:51.125
No. You must have misunderstood.

15:51.159 --> 15:52.793
You seemed pretty clear.

15:52.828 --> 15:56.264
[Scoffs] Trust me,
that's not how I feel at all.

15:56.298 --> 15:57.695
Really?

15:58.300 --> 16:01.720
So we can agree that we're
done taking things slow?

16:01.740 --> 16:05.139
I think it could be time
to speed things up.

16:05.173 --> 16:07.458
Yes.

16:07.478 --> 16:09.455
- Check, please.
- [Chuckles]

16:09.475 --> 16:11.312
I'm really sorry about Marisol.

16:11.346 --> 16:12.480
What happened to her is awful.

16:12.500 --> 16:13.967
Ugh! It is.

16:14.001 --> 16:16.236
You know, her boyfriend had been
abusing her for a while,

16:16.270 --> 16:18.004
but she started taking Jackie's class

16:18.039 --> 16:19.940
and finally found the strength
to get away from him.

16:19.974 --> 16:22.409
Then, for whatever reason,
she let him back into her life,

16:22.443 --> 16:23.977
and it all just started over again.

16:24.011 --> 16:25.145
[Sighs] Dear God.

16:25.179 --> 16:28.115
And now the police want to
talk to all of her friends

16:28.149 --> 16:31.184
from class about it, and I so
don't want to be involved, April.

16:31.219 --> 16:33.954
It took everything I had
to testify against Wilson.

16:33.988 --> 16:36.857
The thought of talking to the cops
literally makes my stomach turn.

16:36.891 --> 16:38.158
You don't have to do it, then.

16:38.192 --> 16:40.026
There are lots of other
women in the class.

16:40.061 --> 16:41.428
Let one of them talk to the police.

16:41.462 --> 16:43.930
You take care of you. It's okay.

16:43.965 --> 16:46.299
[Sighs] Thank you.

16:46.334 --> 16:47.868
Oh, I'm sorry.

16:47.902 --> 16:50.137
I didn't even ask you...
What's going on with Marc?

16:50.171 --> 16:51.938
- [Groans] Nothing good.
- Mm.

16:51.973 --> 16:55.809
He, um, gave back his
keys and moved out.

16:57.178 --> 17:01.114
Wow. I-I can't believe
it's actually over.

17:01.149 --> 17:02.048
Neither can I.

17:02.083 --> 17:05.185
I really can't think about it right now.

17:05.219 --> 17:08.387
The only person who seems
happy about this is my mother.

17:08.423 --> 17:10.156
Ha... I doubt that she's happy.

17:10.191 --> 17:11.358
She keeps saying it's not about Marc,

17:11.392 --> 17:13.660
but then she spends most of
her time badmouthing him to me,

17:13.694 --> 17:14.661
even though we've broken up.

17:14.694 --> 17:17.696
And then today, she kept making
bigoted comments about Michael.

17:17.732 --> 17:20.133
- The transgender guy?
- Yeah. It's a long story.

17:20.167 --> 17:22.234
Anyway, she is driving me crazy.

17:22.270 --> 17:23.869
I really can't keep fighting with her

17:23.905 --> 17:26.339
or trying to keep her sober so she
can eventually get a transplant.

17:26.374 --> 17:28.134
So have a conversation with her.

17:28.154 --> 17:30.877
You've met my mother. Seriously,
it's easier said than done.

17:30.912 --> 17:32.212
April, look, no offense,

17:32.246 --> 17:34.347
but you really need to cowboy up here.

17:34.382 --> 17:36.082
Okay, you can't live in
fear of your mother.

17:36.117 --> 17:37.484
You're a grown-ass woman!

17:37.518 --> 17:38.985
She's not gonna send you to your room.

17:39.020 --> 17:41.154
I know she's sick,
and I know that she's tough,

17:41.189 --> 17:43.156
but you don't let anyone else
walk all over you.

17:43.191 --> 17:46.193
Is this really the example
you want to be setting for Lucy?

17:46.227 --> 17:47.494
I don't think so.

17:49.464 --> 17:51.003
[Sighs]

17:51.023 --> 17:52.866
We should go back to my place, right?

17:52.900 --> 17:54.935
Since, you know, um,
going back to your place

17:54.969 --> 17:57.270
might be a little weird
with the baby and all.

17:57.305 --> 17:58.672
Right. Let me just call Lydia

17:58.706 --> 18:00.240
and make sure she can stay longer.

18:00.274 --> 18:03.109
Okay. I'll go check on the Uber.

18:03.144 --> 18:06.112
[Cellphone rings]

18:06.147 --> 18:07.280
Hey.

18:07.315 --> 18:08.573
Is everything okay?

18:08.593 --> 18:11.218
Yeah, everything's great.
Vivian's asleep.

18:11.252 --> 18:12.252
I want to ask a favor.

18:12.286 --> 18:14.721
Uh, would you mind staying
for a few more hours?

18:14.755 --> 18:17.310
I want to spend
some more time with Adam.

18:18.326 --> 18:21.228
Uh, n-no, I can't. I have plans.

18:21.262 --> 18:24.234
Oh. Could you possibly change them?

18:25.666 --> 18:28.268
No, I'm sorry. I c... I can't.

18:29.337 --> 18:30.704
Okay, then.

18:30.738 --> 18:32.205
I'll be home soon.

18:32.240 --> 18:33.740
Okay.

18:39.514 --> 18:41.381
Okay. Are you ready?

18:41.415 --> 18:43.316
Um, I'm so sorry.

18:43.351 --> 18:45.218
Uh, she can't stay.

18:45.253 --> 18:48.255
Uh... no problem.

18:48.289 --> 18:51.057
How about dinner this weekend?
I'll cook for you.

18:51.092 --> 18:52.705
I'd love that.

18:52.725 --> 18:54.261

18:56.364 --> 18:58.565
- Hey.
- Hey.

18:58.599 --> 19:01.401
- How was the funeral?
- It was... It was nice.

19:01.435 --> 19:02.636
It was awful.

19:02.670 --> 19:05.672
It was a little bit of both, I guess.

19:05.706 --> 19:08.642
And now the, um... The... the cops

19:08.676 --> 19:10.343
want to talk to everyone

19:10.378 --> 19:12.245
about what happened to Marisol, so...

19:12.280 --> 19:16.349
Yeah, well, that makes sense. Just...
do what you can to help, right?

19:16.384 --> 19:17.751
Yeah.

19:18.886 --> 19:21.588
You, uh... You want something
to eat? I've got some...

19:21.622 --> 19:24.324
Oh, no. No. I'm zonked.

19:24.358 --> 19:25.792
How was your day?

19:27.495 --> 19:30.130
Yeah, it was fine. Are you
sure you're all right?

19:30.164 --> 19:31.064
Yeah, I'm fine.

20:08.202 --> 20:09.202
What's up?

20:09.236 --> 20:11.769
Um, so, listen,
I've been doing some thinking,

20:11.789 --> 20:15.208
and, uh, I mean,
it's time that we get real

20:15.242 --> 20:16.843
and we start to focus.

20:16.877 --> 20:19.579
You know, all this time,
we've had two gigs...

20:19.614 --> 20:22.248
I mean, two! And one of
them we had to pay for.

20:22.283 --> 20:24.417
And if we're just for fun,
we can do it at a karaoke bar.

20:24.452 --> 20:26.553
Uh, just settle down, man.
You need to chill.

20:26.587 --> 20:28.421
I don't need to chill, Jonah.

20:28.456 --> 20:30.256
We've been chilling enough, guys.

20:30.291 --> 20:32.058
That's the last thing we need to do.

Guys, this is do-or-die for us.

Now, I know I didn't...
I didn't start this band,

20:45.781 --> 20:49.605
but I gave up the best thing [chuckles]

20:51.039 --> 20:52.259
in my life

20:52.279 --> 20:55.081
to try and... And make this thing work.

20:55.116 --> 20:57.171
What have any of you given up?

Hey, man, it's real, all right?

21:06.794 --> 21:08.928
I live with chronic
discomfort every day.

Hey, I get it, and...
And we all have something.

But, guys, we can't
half-ass this anymore.

21:16.837 --> 21:18.338
let's make music!

Let's do this thing, huh?!

- Come on. Yeah!

- [Door opens]
- Harry, it's nice to see you.

21:54.375 --> 21:56.107
Would you like some coffee or tea?

21:56.127 --> 21:58.195
No, thanks, Elliott. Um, I'm fine.

21:58.229 --> 22:00.230
So, what have you found out
about my deal with Jonathan?

22:00.264 --> 22:01.164
Is getting out an option?

22:01.199 --> 22:03.400
Because [chuckles]
I'm officially worried.

22:03.434 --> 22:04.534
I've gone over the paperwork,

22:04.569 --> 22:06.036
and if Jonathan stops paying you,

22:06.070 --> 22:07.370
we can sue for breach of
contract and get you out.

22:07.405 --> 22:09.739
But it might be a fight
to get your 20% stake

22:09.774 --> 22:10.740
before the IRS got it.

22:10.775 --> 22:12.609
Oh, uh, I'm not interested
in suing anybody.

22:12.643 --> 22:13.944
I mean, I don't have the money

22:13.978 --> 22:15.779
for that kind of prolonged legal fight.

22:15.813 --> 22:17.529
What else is there?

22:19.250 --> 22:21.117
I suggest you wait them out.

22:21.152 --> 22:23.119
If Jonathan's clean,
we go back to normal.

22:23.154 --> 22:25.021
If not, the law's on our side,
and we'll deal with that then.

22:25.056 --> 22:27.257
That could take months
and months to play out, right?

22:27.291 --> 22:29.426
I mean [chuckles] I don't have
that kind of time.

22:29.460 --> 22:31.228
This is my life we're talking about.

22:31.262 --> 22:33.463
I don't know what you
want me to say, Harry.

22:33.498 --> 22:34.865
You're in a bad spot.

22:36.067 --> 22:38.201
Okay.

22:38.236 --> 22:40.370
All right, look. [Sighs]

22:40.404 --> 22:42.305
At one point, the Food
Network had interest

22:42.340 --> 22:44.140
in a second season of my show, right?

22:44.175 --> 22:46.009
They wanted to do a
making-of-a-restaurant type deal,

22:46.043 --> 22:48.445
but this Jonathan project
pushed that aside.

22:48.479 --> 22:50.280
- Okay.
- So here's what I want you to do.

22:50.314 --> 22:52.482
Call whoever you made
the last deal with over there

22:52.517 --> 22:54.648
and see if we could work something out.

22:54.668 --> 22:56.219
Need to know there's
something in the pipeline

22:56.254 --> 22:57.020
before I make any moves.

22:57.054 --> 22:58.822
Harry, this seems like a long shot.

22:58.856 --> 23:00.557
And how are you gonna deal
with the Jonathan issue?

23:00.591 --> 23:03.159
There's no issue, all right?
I'm not saying make a deal.

23:03.194 --> 23:04.361
Just find out, all right?

23:04.395 --> 23:08.697
My whole future's on hold here,
and I need a backup plan.

23:09.367 --> 23:11.568
Let me see what I can find out.

23:17.018 --> 23:20.243
I told Lucy that maybe I'd take
her and Noel to the movies,

23:20.278 --> 23:21.912
but I'll sit in between them.

23:23.347 --> 23:24.781

23:28.319 --> 23:29.586
We need to talk.

23:29.620 --> 23:31.621
About what?

23:31.656 --> 23:34.291
About your attitude.

23:34.325 --> 23:35.625
Excuse me?

23:37.295 --> 23:39.827
Oh, this isn't about
that transgender thing?

23:39.847 --> 23:42.156
Yes, and about Marc, too.

23:42.176 --> 23:44.188
When you say things
like you said yesterday,

23:44.208 --> 23:47.239
people are gonna think that
you're not a tolerant person.

23:47.259 --> 23:48.978
What did I say that was so bad?

23:49.013 --> 23:50.146
You stopped working with him,

23:50.180 --> 23:53.516
so obviously you feel the same
way about those people.

23:53.550 --> 23:54.962
No, I don't.

23:54.982 --> 23:57.420
Would you please
not talk that way around Lucy?

23:57.454 --> 23:59.722
We try not to think
that way around here.

23:59.757 --> 24:01.557
You know, that's your whole problem.

24:01.592 --> 24:03.660
You either think too much or not at all.

24:03.694 --> 24:05.061
That's not how I raised you.

24:05.095 --> 24:07.864
I thought you raised me
to be tolerant of others.

24:07.898 --> 24:10.900
I raised you to be
a proud black Christian woman.

24:10.934 --> 24:12.502

24:12.536 --> 24:15.038

you grew up with.

white boy like Marc

24:17.308 --> 24:19.008
who can barely provide.

24:19.043 --> 24:21.444
Whoa, whoa, I thought
this wasn't about Marc.

24:21.478 --> 24:24.414
Of course it's about Marc,
and it's about you.

choices, April? You did.

24:34.591 --> 24:37.627
Exactly! They are my choices, not yours,

24:37.661 --> 24:40.029

no patience for anyone

who doesn't fit your idea
of what's right.

24:42.433 --> 24:45.868
At least I know who I am
and I can face it.

24:45.903 --> 24:48.304
And your life is never
gonna start getting better

24:48.339 --> 24:50.273
until you can do the same.

24:50.307 --> 24:54.143
Look, Mom, I know you told Marc

24:54.178 --> 24:57.447
that you were gonna get him out of
this house, and somehow you did it.

24:57.481 --> 25:00.116

Uh [chuckles] this is a surprise.

25:19.198 --> 25:21.299
Uh, no, she's out.

25:21.334 --> 25:23.868
I know she wouldn't be
thrilled if I was here.

25:24.678 --> 25:25.770

- Oh, hey, come in, please. Come in.
- Thank you.

25:31.344 --> 25:33.678

25:33.713 --> 25:36.298
but I was raised to be a certain way,

25:36.318 --> 25:37.441
and I am starting to worry

25:37.461 --> 25:39.117
that it's affecting
everything in my life.

25:39.151 --> 25:41.052
Everything? As in what exactly?

25:41.087 --> 25:44.823
My relationships, my... my parenting.

25:44.857 --> 25:47.559
Do I seem intolerant to you?

25:47.593 --> 25:50.395
- Do you seem what now?
- Intolerant.

25:50.429 --> 25:53.498
Do I act like I'm better
than you or anyone else?

25:53.532 --> 25:56.067
Because, clearly,
that's how my mother is.

25:56.102 --> 25:58.709
Well, you've been
nothing but nice to me,

but I can be extremely likeable.

26:03.398 --> 26:06.026
Look, you can be a tough boss,

26:06.046 --> 26:08.380
but I don't think that has
anything to do with me being gay.

26:08.414 --> 26:11.088
It's probably more about
me breaking stuff.

26:12.051 --> 26:13.518
Yeah, you're right about that.

26:13.552 --> 26:15.654
Of course, it's possible deep down

26:15.688 --> 26:16.988
you're a little intolerant.

But isn't everybody? For example,
I cannot watch old people eat.

26:21.594 --> 26:24.596

that I may have hurt him,

what to do about it.

she's too good for people

to talk to the police.

28:42.234 --> 28:44.669
Look, the other girls can
tell the police just as much,

28:44.703 --> 28:46.971

he's not going anywhere, Jackie.

threw me out of the house.

28:55.881 --> 28:58.583
My first night alone,
I crashed on a friend's couch.

28:58.617 --> 29:00.251
I'd never been more afraid in my life.

29:00.286 --> 29:02.187
I mean, I didn't know
how I was gonna survive.

Not that night or every day after that.

29:07.860 --> 29:11.329
I fought my fear, and I got on with it.

stronger than I thought I was.

Did you have a date?

29:52.838 --> 29:55.940
Of course not. When was the
last time I had a date?

29:55.975 --> 29:58.276
But you said you had plans.

29:58.310 --> 29:59.986
I did.

day at work and relax.

- I can't just reschedule my life

30:07.482 --> 30:10.822
I wasn't doing whatever.
I was on a date.

30:10.856 --> 30:12.824
And how was it?

30:12.858 --> 30:15.423
Because I don't get a
good vibe from that guy.

30:15.928 --> 30:19.797

Of course. Totally.

on the situation, I guess. Why?

31:24.560 --> 31:28.062
I sometimes saw opportunities
where others didn't,

and I took it.

31:30.726 --> 31:32.696
That's what building a business
is all about, right?

31:32.716 --> 31:35.670
Perhaps. But I was greedy at times.

31:35.704 --> 31:39.140
I chose the deal over the person.

away, at least not for a while,

38:33.071 --> 38:35.519
He cannot not talk to you even more.

38:35.554 --> 38:36.749
[Chuckles]

38:36.769 --> 38:38.949
Yeah, you're right.

38:39.891 --> 38:41.352
- [Beep]
- Sent.

38:41.888 --> 38:43.494
Too late to change my mind now.

38:43.528 --> 38:45.029
What'd you decide to do about Marc?

38:45.063 --> 38:47.465
[Clicks tongue] I don't even know.

38:47.499 --> 38:49.619
Wow, you have more boy
troubles than I do.

38:49.639 --> 38:52.470
- [Sighs]
- One piece of advice... With Marc,

38:52.504 --> 38:54.572
I think sending an e-mail
may be a little impersonal

38:54.606 --> 38:57.508
considering you guys
were together for over a year.

38:57.528 --> 38:58.876
Thanks.

39:00.679 --> 39:02.446
[Sighs]

39:08.606 --> 39:10.841
Hey, Marc, it's April.

39:10.861 --> 39:13.491
I'd like to talk if you get a chance.

39:17.707 --> 39:19.177
[Laughs]

39:19.211 --> 39:21.879
Man, hands down, best concert I've seen

39:21.914 --> 39:24.782
since Black Crowes,
Wiltern Theater, 2013.

39:24.817 --> 39:26.951
Oh, my Lord! Oh, it was so inspiring.

39:26.985 --> 39:29.607
That... that passion, that energy,

39:29.627 --> 39:31.622
when it all comes together
like that on stage.

39:31.657 --> 39:33.024
- Oh, my...
- That's it. It settles it.

39:33.058 --> 39:34.832
I'm doing it. I made up my mind.

39:34.852 --> 39:37.681
- Doing what?
- You were right the other day.

39:37.701 --> 39:39.613
I'm leaving the band
and I'm doing my own thing.

39:39.633 --> 39:41.432
Oh, I am so proud of you.

39:41.467 --> 39:43.334
And I want you to do it with me.

39:43.572 --> 39:44.702
What?

39:45.386 --> 39:46.897
- Are you serious?
- Damn right I am.

39:46.917 --> 39:48.539
We are so good together, Sofia.

39:48.574 --> 39:50.564
We got to give it a shot.

39:50.584 --> 39:51.584
You in?

39:52.418 --> 39:54.915
Hell, yeah. [Chuckles]

39:59.585 --> 40:00.985
Mm. Sofia, wait.

40:01.019 --> 40:02.720
I just... I just broke up.
You know this, right?

40:02.754 --> 40:05.256
Oh, of course I know.

40:05.290 --> 40:06.424
No pressure.

40:06.458 --> 40:08.826
All right, I screwed up things
with us the first time.

40:08.861 --> 40:11.001
I don't want to do that again.

40:11.168 --> 40:13.191
I'm willing to wait, okay? I...

40:15.367 --> 40:19.337
This... doesn't have to go past
tonight if you don't want it to.

40:19.371 --> 40:21.272
Let's not talk about that right now.

40:31.945 --> 40:33.238
Karen?

40:40.726 --> 40:44.328
Karen? I forgot my phone.

You okay?

Not really.
