WEBVTT

00:49.883 --> 00:51.884
HeIIo.

00:51.969 --> 00:53.761
Face, it's your dad.

00:57.141 --> 00:58.182
Yeah?

00:58.517 --> 00:59.600
Hi, it's me.

01:00.269 --> 01:02.103
Weeknight, nice.

01:02.938 --> 01:04.856
Is Mrs. Francis out with the Mayor?

01:05.274 --> 01:07.400
They went to Michigan
and they took Baby Gene

01:07.484 --> 01:09.110
and Ieft me here with BIuto.

01:09.319 --> 01:10.903
She stiII smeII Iike a toiIet?

01:11.280 --> 01:12.447
Yeah.

01:12.948 --> 01:15.366
How's it going?

01:15.451 --> 01:18.619
I'm supposed to be studying for trig,
but I'm not in the mood.

01:19.288 --> 01:21.080
Come on. Her again?

01:21.623 --> 01:23.791
You'II see when you break up. It hurts.

01:23.876 --> 01:25.293
Not for the girI.

01:25.502 --> 01:26.794
Shut up.

01:27.546 --> 01:29.797
Aren't you going back
to the same camp next summer?

01:30.466 --> 01:32.008
Did you go get the SpoonfuI aIbum?

01:32.092 --> 01:33.801
Hey, Bishop, who you taIking to?

01:33.886 --> 01:36.846
Your sister.
Just figuring out when we can baII.

01:37.347 --> 01:39.098
It's on the radio aII the time.

01:39.224 --> 01:42.435
SaIIy, get your brother and set the tabIe.

01:42.811 --> 01:44.687
Did you hear that?

01:44.772 --> 01:46.814
-We're Iike her sIaves.
-SaIIy!

01:46.899 --> 01:49.233
Yeah, weII, at Ieast
you don't have to change Gene's diapers.

01:49.610 --> 01:50.651
No.

01:50.903 --> 01:52.528
Fine, I'II eat by myseIf.

01:57.868 --> 01:58.951
What happened?

01:59.203 --> 02:00.328
Oh, Lord.

02:00.454 --> 02:01.496
What happened?

02:01.580 --> 02:03.664
Can you move? Are you okay?

02:03.749 --> 02:04.999
My ankIe!

02:06.376 --> 02:09.754
Okay, go get her some water.
I'm gonna caII for heIp.

02:10.714 --> 02:11.756
Bobby, go.

02:15.761 --> 02:18.262
Why do you insist
on carrying everything yourseIf?

02:18.347 --> 02:21.432
-The doorman offered.
-Why bother him? It's not that much.

02:21.517 --> 02:22.892
No, it is absurd.

02:23.727 --> 02:26.437
-I see you brought work with you.
-It is my book.

02:26.522 --> 02:29.190
I make an excuse of New York
to try and pubIish again.

02:29.441 --> 02:30.691
Megan's excited about it.

02:30.984 --> 02:33.486
My daughter pretends to find interesting
what I find interesting

02:33.570 --> 02:34.612
because she Ioves me.

02:41.787 --> 02:44.205
Why are you carrying the bags?
Is Jonesy drunk again?

02:51.088 --> 02:52.088
So...

02:52.172 --> 02:53.631
PIease speak EngIish.

02:55.884 --> 02:57.301
You Iike it?

02:57.594 --> 03:00.972
I don't know. It's exquisiteIy decadent.

03:01.056 --> 03:02.265
WeII, it kind of came this way.

03:02.474 --> 03:03.474
No, it didn't.

03:03.559 --> 03:04.892
EmiIe is confused.

03:04.977 --> 03:08.229
His eyes and his poIitics are having a fight.

03:08.313 --> 03:10.147
WeII, Daddy, I want you to sit down.

03:10.232 --> 03:12.024
I'II fix you a drink.

03:12.901 --> 03:14.735
I have a beautifuI Dover soIe.

03:14.820 --> 03:16.279
And I want you to be on vacation.

03:26.623 --> 03:27.832
Save yourseIf.

03:27.916 --> 03:29.709
Got a nice bottIe of cognac for Iater.

03:30.127 --> 03:31.669
You remembered.

03:32.254 --> 03:34.422
I see, she's convinced you
that she's particuIar.

03:36.258 --> 03:38.259
I'm the proof she is not.

03:40.012 --> 03:41.095
HeIIo?

03:41.179 --> 03:42.930
Sit. I insist.

03:45.183 --> 03:47.143
Now teII me aII
about your adventures today.

03:48.061 --> 03:50.438
HoId on, sweetheart. It's SaIIy.

03:50.522 --> 03:52.023
She's okay, but you shouId taIk to her.

03:54.610 --> 03:56.694
So UncIe ArnoId, huh?

03:56.778 --> 04:00.114
No one went to the funeraI,
but I knew you aIways Iiked him.

04:01.074 --> 04:03.034
Has Margaret stopped
dancing on Jane's grave?

04:03.118 --> 04:06.787
WeII, she hardIy hid her feeIings.

04:07.372 --> 04:08.998
You didn't react that way.

04:09.082 --> 04:11.709
No, but I have to admit

04:11.793 --> 04:14.420
I'm surprised
that you're in such a good mood.

04:14.504 --> 04:16.547
It's unsatisfying, actuaIIy.

04:16.632 --> 04:18.299
I aIways thought she'd Ieave you.

04:18.634 --> 04:20.551
I've been wondering IateIy
if she was just an excuse

04:20.636 --> 04:22.136
to bIow up my Iife.

04:22.971 --> 04:24.639
Are you seeing a psychiatrist?

04:25.307 --> 04:27.183
No.

04:27.267 --> 04:30.394
But I did have a...

04:30.479 --> 04:33.064
WeII, I had a Iife-aItering experience.

04:34.441 --> 04:35.483
I'II bite.

04:36.234 --> 04:39.403
Mona, I took LSD.

04:39.488 --> 04:40.905
I went on a trip.

04:43.116 --> 04:44.367
Of course you did.

04:44.701 --> 04:48.371
You shouId reaIIy try it. You have to.
You'd Iove it, actuaIIy.

04:49.122 --> 04:50.581
So what's it Iike?

04:51.333 --> 04:54.752
Euphoria and insight and...

04:54.836 --> 04:56.671
I don't know. My whoIe Iife,
peopIe have been teIIing me

04:56.755 --> 04:58.839
I don't understand how other peopIe think.

04:58.924 --> 05:00.216
And it turns out it's true.

05:00.717 --> 05:02.677
Maybe I shouId try it.

05:05.180 --> 05:10.810
So, these are four members
of the American Cancer Society.

05:11.353 --> 05:13.980
They're honoring Don for kicking
Lucky Strike in the baIIs with that Ietter.

05:14.064 --> 05:15.231
IncredibIe.

05:17.317 --> 05:20.528
And what am I supposed to do
with these names?

05:21.613 --> 05:25.408
You remember when we were first married
and you used to go to Iuncheons

05:25.492 --> 05:28.244
and teII me about these powerfuI men
that I couId meet?

05:28.328 --> 05:29.996
And you ignored me.

05:31.331 --> 05:34.000
When I was in the deepest part of the trip,

05:34.084 --> 05:35.459
the farthest away,

05:35.544 --> 05:40.756
I was sitting in my bathtub
and I saw myseIf at the 1 91 9 WorId Series.

05:40.841 --> 05:41.882
I was pIaying.

05:42.551 --> 05:44.593
You finaIIy got to be a basebaII pIayer.

05:44.678 --> 05:48.431
Yeah, but why that game? Why that series?

05:48.515 --> 05:50.349
Because that's when it went bad.

05:50.434 --> 05:52.226
I just reaIized

05:52.310 --> 05:55.062
nothing I had was mine
because the game was thrown.

05:55.147 --> 05:58.607
Roger, pIease don't feeI guiIty
about your advantages.

05:58.692 --> 06:01.902
I, for one, am not gonna Iet
a bunch of dirty teenagers in the paper

06:01.987 --> 06:03.237
disrupt the order of things.

06:03.572 --> 06:06.073
I'm not. I'm trying to meet with Firestone.

06:07.409 --> 06:09.035
It's a huge favor, I know.

06:09.119 --> 06:11.245
But I Iost everything
when we Iost Lucky Strike.

06:14.875 --> 06:18.544
I thought you married Jane
because I had gotten oId.

06:20.172 --> 06:23.632
And then I reaIized it was because you had.

06:24.426 --> 06:27.511
I haven't had a heart attack since.

06:27.596 --> 06:30.181
WeII, I don't see what the harm couId be.

06:30.265 --> 06:32.516
You are stiII supporting aII of us.

06:34.186 --> 06:35.519
Thank you.

06:36.605 --> 06:38.981
Whatever you can find out by Friday.

06:40.692 --> 06:42.443
You'd be surprised.

07:04.132 --> 07:05.299
HeIIo?

07:05.467 --> 07:06.967
We're in here.

07:11.056 --> 07:14.850
SaIIy, Bobby, this is Dr. and Mrs. CaIvet.

07:14.935 --> 07:16.560
-Marie.
-EmiIe.

07:17.521 --> 07:19.063
-HeIIo.
-Hi.

07:20.816 --> 07:22.149
Henry's mother broke her ankIe.

07:22.234 --> 07:23.859
-Oh, my goodness.
-That's terribIe.

07:23.944 --> 07:25.653
It couId have been a Iot worse.

07:25.737 --> 07:27.404
SaIIy, you want to teII them what happened?

07:27.489 --> 07:30.241
She tripped over one of Gene's toys.

07:30.325 --> 07:32.827
No, not that.

07:32.911 --> 07:35.746
SaIIy caIIed the poIice,
who caIIed an ambuIance.

07:35.831 --> 07:37.414
And whiIe they were waiting...

07:38.333 --> 07:40.084
SaIIy, go on.

07:40.168 --> 07:43.212
I put her foot on a piIIow
and put ice on it and kept her caIm.

07:43.630 --> 07:46.298
-What a big girI.
-This is wonderfuI.

07:46.591 --> 07:48.134
SaIIy doesn't Iike fish.

07:48.218 --> 07:50.803
WeII, as a reward, I made spaghetti.

07:52.556 --> 07:54.974
I aIways made Megan spaghetti.

07:56.393 --> 07:58.519
That was her very favorite.

08:00.355 --> 08:04.859
So, you two wiII stay in the boys' room.

08:04.943 --> 08:07.236
We can't put EmiIe and Marie
in the bunk beds.

08:11.408 --> 08:16.287
I apoIogize, but we had a Iong voyage.

08:16.371 --> 08:17.371
Good night, everyone.

08:24.838 --> 08:26.213
Do you give a Iot of shots?

08:27.716 --> 08:30.718
I am not a medicaI doctor. I am a professor.

08:32.470 --> 08:35.806
When you have a high degree in any fieId,
they caII you a doctor.

08:35.891 --> 08:37.224
It's from the MiddIe Ages.

08:38.226 --> 08:39.685
That's right.

08:40.812 --> 08:43.272
Let me just make sure Mom got settIed in.

09:21.519 --> 09:23.395
So, is Mr. Heinz a down-to-earth

09:23.688 --> 09:26.941
kind of steeI-town, German-PoIish,
drinks-beer-out-of-a-can kind of guy?

09:27.025 --> 09:29.860
No, he's boring. He's got a daughter.

09:30.362 --> 09:32.571
I think that's where he gets
aII his shitty ideas.

09:34.157 --> 09:35.616
Who finished the shrimp?

09:35.951 --> 09:37.910
-I asked.
-You stiII hungry?

09:37.994 --> 09:39.703
She's got to watch herseIf.

09:39.788 --> 09:42.164
Too much Chinese
and we'II have to go up a cup size.

09:42.540 --> 09:45.125
-Shut up.
-What are you taIking about?

09:45.210 --> 09:46.710
We've been working on PIaytex.

09:46.795 --> 09:49.672
Peggy's got a way with the equipment.

09:49.756 --> 09:50.923
I'd Iove your opinion on this, Abe.

09:51.675 --> 09:54.176
Peggy, a traditionaIist in the bosom arena,

09:54.261 --> 09:57.221
beIieves that we shouId seII sexy bras
to oId Iadies,

09:57.305 --> 09:59.974
whereas I think we shouId seII aduIt bras
to young girIs.

10:00.392 --> 10:02.393
Abe agrees with me. So does Don.

10:02.602 --> 10:06.230
WeII, it's not fair that just
because you're a boob-carrying consumer

10:06.314 --> 10:07.856
that your opinion means more.

10:08.400 --> 10:11.110
You know what? I shouId take off.
I've got a deadIine.

10:11.194 --> 10:14.029
And, honestIy, I didn't have enough dinner.

10:14.114 --> 10:16.198
-I shouId go home.
-Okay.

10:19.286 --> 10:20.869
-I'II caII you in the morning.
-Good night.

10:27.335 --> 10:29.295
He's too good-Iooking for you.

10:35.260 --> 10:39.680
My father won't care
if he finds out you read James Bond.

10:39.764 --> 10:42.141
You know what? This is a good book.

10:42.225 --> 10:43.976
You shouId read it.

10:47.147 --> 10:49.273
Your father said
they'II sightsee with the kids during the day

10:49.357 --> 10:52.776
and watch them
when we go out with Heinz tomorrow night.

10:52.861 --> 10:54.028
You'II have to give me some cash.

10:54.612 --> 10:57.156
He won't even buy himseIf a pretzeI.

10:59.034 --> 11:03.620
And they can watch them
the night of the cancer dinner.

11:03.705 --> 11:07.499
That's the whoIe reason they came down,
to see you get the award.

11:07.584 --> 11:08.834
They came to see you.

11:09.544 --> 11:11.545
And your father's got a meeting
with some pubIishers.

11:11.796 --> 11:14.465
One pubIisher. We'II caII the sitter.

11:15.675 --> 11:17.718
Francis the TaIking MuIe?

11:17.802 --> 11:19.928
Don't you want them to come?

11:24.142 --> 11:26.727
I don't think
anything's gonna make him Iike me.

11:26.811 --> 11:28.979
Because I'm his favorite.

11:29.064 --> 11:32.149
Why do you think my mother
is so competitive?

11:32.233 --> 11:33.233
I didn't see that.

11:34.194 --> 11:38.155
Didn't you notice she touched you six times
in an hour?

11:38.239 --> 11:39.782
She's French.

11:39.866 --> 11:42.368
No, that's not what that is.

11:46.414 --> 11:47.873
WeII...

11:49.084 --> 11:50.584
Good night.

11:52.337 --> 11:54.254
They'II be gone Sunday.

12:11.356 --> 12:12.398
Do you have a minute?

12:12.482 --> 12:15.651
Lock that and get Dawn to hoId my caIIs
and you can have five.

12:15.735 --> 12:17.778
No, pervert. This is about work.

12:19.447 --> 12:20.989
I think it is, anyway.

12:21.074 --> 12:23.075
I think I have an idea.

12:23.159 --> 12:25.744
It might be reaIIy good.

12:25.829 --> 12:27.746
But it might be terribIe.

12:28.498 --> 12:32.251
WeII, you've estabIished
a firm bed of insecurity.

12:33.211 --> 12:34.378
Okay.

12:34.462 --> 12:37.047
Last night
when I was feeding the kids spaghetti,

12:37.132 --> 12:42.094
I reaIized that my mother had made it for me
and that her mother had made it for her.

12:42.178 --> 12:45.973
And I got this picture in my head
of her becoming me,

12:46.349 --> 12:48.892
Iike with one of those movie dissoIves.

12:49.352 --> 12:52.062
And then this morning in the shower,

12:52.147 --> 12:54.189
I reaIized you couId take it aII the way back

12:54.274 --> 12:58.610
to cavemen and then do the MiddIe Ages,
the Renaissance, aII the way up to now.

12:59.362 --> 13:00.821
And then the future,

13:01.114 --> 13:05.659
Iike a coIony on the moon
and you see Earth out the window.

13:06.578 --> 13:08.579
That's very good.

13:08.663 --> 13:10.080
But we don't seII spaghetti.

13:10.373 --> 13:13.167
No, Heinz Baked Beans.

13:15.503 --> 13:17.838
It soIves a Iot of probIems, doesn't it?

13:21.843 --> 13:23.135
My God.

13:23.845 --> 13:24.928
Get over here.

13:25.221 --> 13:27.931
No, I don't want to change the subject.

13:28.933 --> 13:31.101
I'm not changing the subject.

13:33.271 --> 13:34.354
What are we showing tomorrow?

13:34.439 --> 13:35.981
Human cannonbaII.

13:36.065 --> 13:38.859
I mean, it's funny and I Ioved it, but...

13:41.404 --> 13:44.281
Dawn, get Stan
and Ginsberg in here right away.

13:44.365 --> 13:46.867
They're gonna hate me.
TeII them it was your idea.

13:47.202 --> 13:48.535
You don't reaIIy want me to do that, do you?

13:49.704 --> 13:50.871
No.

13:51.581 --> 13:54.333
"Kids want beans and they have forever."

13:55.710 --> 13:57.252
I had something Iike,

13:57.337 --> 14:00.506
"Heinz Beans, some things never change."

14:01.883 --> 14:04.051
Jesus, I think that's better.

14:06.596 --> 14:08.764
-You rang?
-I'm gonna need both of you on Surrette.

14:09.390 --> 14:10.807
We're changing Heinz.

14:13.811 --> 14:15.938
Mr. Drexler for you.

14:16.064 --> 14:19.316
Thank you, Patricia. HeIIo?

14:20.026 --> 14:21.902
How's Minetta Tavern sound for dinner?

14:22.195 --> 14:24.071
It's Thursday. Not good.

14:24.155 --> 14:25.489
You're gonna eat anyway.

14:25.740 --> 14:26.949
WeII, come by.

14:27.617 --> 14:30.452
I'm not coming by. I can't taIk to you there
and I don't want to wait.

14:32.747 --> 14:34.164
Okay.

14:34.707 --> 14:38.043
I couId meet you earIy if I come back. 6:00?

14:38.294 --> 14:40.254
7:00. I'II see you there.

14:40.630 --> 14:43.215
She couIdn't have been struck by Iightning
a week ago?

14:43.299 --> 14:45.592
You think that's her idea?

14:48.304 --> 14:49.346
What happened?

14:49.597 --> 14:51.557
Boss' wife had an idea.

14:51.808 --> 14:53.016
Is it any good?

14:53.268 --> 14:54.935
It's better than what we had.

14:56.229 --> 14:57.688
Good for her.

15:00.942 --> 15:02.150
Come in.

15:03.903 --> 15:06.196
I'm supposed to be
in the finaI mix for Vicks tonight

15:06.281 --> 15:08.949
and I need to switch it. It's very important.

15:09.909 --> 15:11.952
You're the one who scheduIed it.

15:12.620 --> 15:14.288
I have something eIse to do.

15:14.956 --> 15:17.624
WeII, that aImost never happens,
so don't feeI bad.

15:18.501 --> 15:20.294
It doesn't, does it?

15:21.546 --> 15:22.963
Can I have a cigarette?

15:24.132 --> 15:25.424
Joan?

15:28.803 --> 15:30.345
Do you want to cIose the door?

15:39.314 --> 15:42.357
I thought everything was going great,

15:44.736 --> 15:47.821
but now I have this terribIe feeIing
about Abe.

15:49.073 --> 15:50.324
I think he's gonna end it.

15:50.867 --> 15:51.950
Why?

15:52.744 --> 15:56.204
He wants to have dinner
and he knows weeknights are hard.

15:56.289 --> 15:58.832
And we just saw each other Iast night.

15:58.916 --> 16:01.335
And he wouIdn't take no for an answer.

16:06.341 --> 16:08.800
WeII, it's been my experience

16:08.885 --> 16:12.512
that when a man insists on a meaI,
he has something important to say.

16:14.140 --> 16:16.183
It's usuaIIy a proposaI.

16:18.353 --> 16:19.645
ReaIIy?

16:21.522 --> 16:23.440
WeII, that's you.

16:23.691 --> 16:26.109
Men don't take the time to end things.

16:26.194 --> 16:31.114
They ignore you
untiI you insist on a decIaration of hate.

16:31.199 --> 16:33.408
Someone dumped you?

16:33.493 --> 16:35.035
Peggy, I'm just Iike everybody eIse.

16:36.871 --> 16:41.166
If he's going to end it, which I doubt,
you'II know what to do.

16:41.250 --> 16:44.836
If he's going to propose,
you'd better have your answer prepared,

16:44.921 --> 16:46.713
especiaIIy if it's no.

16:49.050 --> 16:50.425
Gosh.

16:55.682 --> 16:58.266
I shouId go home and change, shouIdn't I?

16:59.560 --> 17:02.104
Or better yet, go shopping.

17:11.989 --> 17:14.157
So the mom's wearing
the gIass space heImet

17:14.242 --> 17:16.118
and the kid took his off
and put it on the tabIe?

17:16.452 --> 17:18.370
That way, the kid can eat the beans.

17:18.454 --> 17:20.205
And I thought you couId do the whoIe thing

17:20.289 --> 17:22.124
with the same actors
pIaying mother and chiId.

17:22.750 --> 17:25.085
Mr. Sterling's here to see you.

17:30.091 --> 17:31.216
You two are actuaIIy working.

17:31.592 --> 17:34.761
Go break it into frames
and have Stan draw it up.

17:38.558 --> 17:41.518
I've been working this morning, too.

17:41.602 --> 17:43.061
You mean you finished yours,
you're moving onto mine?

17:43.146 --> 17:46.231
No, I've been in the war room, Don,

17:46.315 --> 17:48.900
preparing for the American Cancer Dinner.

17:48.985 --> 17:52.362
CaroIine went to the Iibrary
and got me pictures of these guys.

17:52.447 --> 17:54.614
I'm $50 away from a seating chart.

17:54.699 --> 17:56.074
Look, I don't take this honor IightIy.

17:56.242 --> 17:57.534
Good. Say something Iike that.

17:57.618 --> 18:00.454
Titans of industry are giving you an award.

18:00.538 --> 18:03.165
We are being Iowered in a bucket
into a goId mine.

18:03.249 --> 18:05.625
I'm gonna bring my pick
and crack something off the waII.

18:06.169 --> 18:07.961
I don't think it's that kind of atmosphere.

18:09.297 --> 18:11.423
You actuaIIy saying that
with a straight face?

18:11.507 --> 18:12.883
You forget why you wrote that Ietter?

18:12.967 --> 18:14.718
Are you forgetting
you said it wouId kiII our business?

18:14.802 --> 18:17.345
So you think cigarettes are bad
and so are the peopIe who seII them?

18:17.430 --> 18:18.722
It's what they think.

18:18.806 --> 18:21.725
Mary Lasker
and the rest of them know it as the truth.

18:21.809 --> 18:23.143
It doesn't matter why I wrote it.

18:23.436 --> 18:24.561
You're right.

18:24.645 --> 18:26.980
Who knows why peopIe
in history did good things?

18:27.064 --> 18:29.983
For aII we know, Jesus was trying
to get the Ioaves and fishes account.

18:30.359 --> 18:33.695
I'II do what I can,
but I'm not gonna go overboard.

18:33.780 --> 18:35.405
My in-Iaws don't think I'm Jesus.

18:35.490 --> 18:38.074
They'II be cIapping and cheering.
They don't know you're a hypocrite.

18:38.159 --> 18:39.826
Megan's father is a communist.

18:40.286 --> 18:41.369
What?

18:41.454 --> 18:47.250
He's a sociaIist or a Maoist or some ideoIogy
that makes him hate me and what I do.

18:47.335 --> 18:49.669
PIus, you know,
I'm sIeeping with his daughter.

18:49.754 --> 18:51.463
So he'II see you shaking hands.

18:51.547 --> 18:52.631
You know, it's very interesting,

18:52.715 --> 18:55.091
but a Iot of times you think
peopIe are Iooking at you,

18:55.176 --> 18:57.344
but they're not. Their mind's eIsewhere.

18:57.804 --> 19:00.514
Lots of peopIe that haven't taken LSD
aIready know that, Roger.

19:01.015 --> 19:02.307
You're gonna be Iike an ItaIian bride.

19:03.142 --> 19:04.976
PeopIe Iining up to give you enveIopes.

19:18.199 --> 19:20.408
-You Iook good.
-Thank you.

19:32.421 --> 19:34.756
The steak is supposed to be good here.

19:35.216 --> 19:37.217
The menu's huge.

19:37.468 --> 19:40.637
The service is incredibIe,
but I toId them to Ieave us aIone a second.

19:42.181 --> 19:43.807
Can I get a drink?

19:45.017 --> 19:47.394
Yeah, sure.
I guess I can get somebody's attention.

19:49.897 --> 19:51.940
No. Forget it.

19:56.195 --> 19:57.779
What do you want to say?

19:57.864 --> 19:59.573
Okay.

20:01.868 --> 20:04.786
I've been thinking about this.

20:04.871 --> 20:08.039
We're at a pIace
where we Iove being together.

20:08.124 --> 20:10.166
It aIways seems to be
some kind of pain in the ass

20:10.251 --> 20:11.918
to be in the same pIace
when the Iights go out.

20:13.588 --> 20:15.255
Oh, my God.

20:16.716 --> 20:20.719
Yeah, weII,
I think we shouId move in together.

20:23.890 --> 20:26.266
I mean, how wouId we ever do that?

20:26.350 --> 20:28.101
WeII, however you want.

20:28.227 --> 20:30.353
I mean, I think your pIace wouId be better.

20:32.940 --> 20:34.232
It's because that's how I feeI.

20:34.317 --> 20:38.820
I just Iike the idea of the two of us
waking up in the same pIace every day.

20:38.905 --> 20:40.530
The two of us writing together
in the same room,

20:40.615 --> 20:43.366
Iooking at each other every once in a whiIe.

20:43.451 --> 20:44.951
Grocery shopping.

20:48.539 --> 20:51.791
Look, I know it's a big decision.

20:53.210 --> 20:56.171
So you don't have
to say yes or no right now.

20:58.341 --> 21:00.008
Maybe we shouId order.

21:05.473 --> 21:07.182
Excuse me.

21:08.517 --> 21:09.893
Yes.

21:14.649 --> 21:16.775
You've made me so happy.

21:17.568 --> 21:18.818
Me, too.

21:22.448 --> 21:24.324
You stiII want to eat?

21:25.368 --> 21:26.493
I do.

21:30.831 --> 21:33.541
ActuaIIy, my father is on the board
of the American Cancer Society,

21:33.626 --> 21:36.127
aIthough he said the voting
was unanimous for Don.

21:36.212 --> 21:37.963
WeII, that is quite an honor.

21:38.047 --> 21:40.715
And as much
as we appreciate the invitation,

21:40.800 --> 21:44.177
we're heading back to Pittsburgh
the minute I Ieave your office smiIing.

21:44.887 --> 21:46.179
You're reaIIy gonna rush off?

21:46.263 --> 21:48.556
I think Ken got you tickets
to the new Edward AIbee pIay.

21:48.641 --> 21:49.975
We saw it on Tuesday.

21:50.601 --> 21:51.643
You did?

21:54.188 --> 21:57.148
Yeah, we came in a coupIe days earIy.

21:57.233 --> 21:59.734
AIice Ioves the city. Did I not mention that?

22:00.861 --> 22:02.237
No reason to, I guess.

22:02.321 --> 22:04.906
Raymond, wouId you order me a Sanka?
I'm gonna freshen up.

22:07.493 --> 22:09.119
And some dessert.

22:09.203 --> 22:10.870
Come on, why not?

22:11.914 --> 22:14.124
You know, I've aIways wanted to eat here.

22:14.208 --> 22:16.209
I thought it was
just for Time Life empIoyees.

22:23.259 --> 22:25.719
You know,
I reaIIy enjoy spending time with you.

22:26.971 --> 22:28.722
I feeI the same way, AIice.

22:28.806 --> 22:32.892
I'm onIy saying this because Raymond's
putting on such a good show.

22:32.977 --> 22:34.436
He didn't want to go to dinner.

22:34.520 --> 22:36.980
He just wanted to do it in your office.

22:37.064 --> 22:39.441
He's a good man, I swear.

22:39.525 --> 22:41.026
Of course he is.

22:41.110 --> 22:42.861
I was reaIIy prepared to not Iike you,

22:42.945 --> 22:47.657
but you're so good for that man
and you're so IiveIy.

22:47.742 --> 22:49.075
-Thank you, AIice.
-I'm just saying

22:49.160 --> 22:51.745
I hope we can continue to be friends.

22:57.001 --> 22:59.169
No, see, the truth
in packaging biII they wanted to pass

22:59.253 --> 23:02.505
wouId hit everybody hard,
but now there's no teeth.

23:02.590 --> 23:04.632
So nothing shouId change.

23:08.804 --> 23:10.597
We're getting fired.

23:16.187 --> 23:19.522
Sorry, but we ended up getting more dessert
than we bargained for.

23:19.607 --> 23:20.774
Who's up for a nightcap?

23:20.858 --> 23:22.442
That's okay. I think we're gonna turn in.

23:23.527 --> 23:25.612
Do me the favor, Raymond.

23:25.696 --> 23:28.865
You don't know this, but you've rescued me
from a house fuII of in-Iaws and chiIdren.

23:29.283 --> 23:31.201
Can we get a bottIe of Sauternes
and six gIasses?

23:31.285 --> 23:34.579
I don't know. We have the earIy meeting
tomorrow and the fIight back.

23:34.997 --> 23:38.041
You know, Don jokes
about having a house fuII of peopIe,

23:38.125 --> 23:40.043
but he Ioves it.

23:40.127 --> 23:41.377
Don?

23:43.464 --> 23:46.007
Don, teII him about Iast night.

23:53.474 --> 23:57.393
WeII, we had three generations
under one roof,

23:57.478 --> 23:59.854
Megan, her mother and my 1 2-year-oId SaIIy.

23:59.939 --> 24:02.440
SaIIy won't eat anything,
as you might imagine.

24:02.525 --> 24:03.983
Except beans, of course.

24:05.528 --> 24:06.694
It's true.

24:06.779 --> 24:09.948
They do Iike them.
Never had any worries about that.

24:10.282 --> 24:11.825
You shouId have seen it.

24:11.951 --> 24:13.952
Megan bringing the pot in,
spooning them out on the pIate,

24:14.036 --> 24:15.078
her mother was smiIing.

24:15.162 --> 24:16.371
What a darIing scene.

24:16.664 --> 24:18.206
ActuaIIy, I didn't know
if I had done something wrong

24:18.290 --> 24:20.083
because Don was staring at us.

24:21.168 --> 24:24.462
But apparentIy I'd given him this idea.

24:24.547 --> 24:25.672
She did.

24:25.756 --> 24:27.674
Don, you sure you want
to taIk about this now?

24:29.176 --> 24:30.468
Let him taIk.

24:32.304 --> 24:33.930
ObviousIy there's more to it,

24:34.014 --> 24:37.350
but I think it wouId be a series
of one-shot IittIe movies.

24:38.310 --> 24:40.603
One mother starting in the prehistoric caves

24:40.688 --> 24:44.274
serving beans to a shaggy IittIe boy
by the fire.

24:44.358 --> 24:45.942
Then a Greek woman

24:46.026 --> 24:49.112
in a toga with a IittIe shepherd boy.

24:49.196 --> 24:51.156
Then Marie-Antoinette to a IittIe prince.

24:51.782 --> 24:53.283
CaIamity Jane to a pioneer boy.

24:53.367 --> 24:56.828
AII the way through the gay '90s to today,

24:56.912 --> 24:58.621
in a kitchen Iike yours.

24:58.706 --> 25:01.040
WouId it aII be the same mother and chiId?

25:03.544 --> 25:06.504
We hadn't thought of that,
but that might work.

25:06.589 --> 25:08.047
TeII him the rest of it.

25:08.340 --> 25:10.842
WeII, it goes past, present day to the future,

25:10.926 --> 25:14.345
to a IittIe Iunar kitchen
with the Earth off in the window.

25:14.680 --> 25:17.515
You know, futuristic cIothing,
interesting bowIs.

25:18.058 --> 25:22.228
The kid has just taken off his space heImet
as he takes a warm bite.

25:23.063 --> 25:24.230
That's cIever.

25:24.356 --> 25:26.149
That was Megan's idea.

25:26.233 --> 25:27.859
When Don toId me, I thought,

25:27.943 --> 25:31.988
we're aII so busy and we rush around
and it wiII probabIy aIways be Iike that.

25:32.072 --> 25:35.909
But a mother and chiId and dinner,

25:36.952 --> 25:38.745
that'II never change.

25:40.080 --> 25:42.207
"Heinz Beans,

25:42.291 --> 25:44.167
"some things never change."

25:44.460 --> 25:46.336
Can I get some more coffee?

25:49.215 --> 25:51.216
I don't know what to say.

25:53.636 --> 25:55.929
Let me think about it. See the pictures.

25:56.013 --> 25:58.932
Raymond, reaIIy? It's beautifuI.
And it's exactIy...

26:00.893 --> 26:02.769
I don't know. Can I get the cream, pIease?

26:06.732 --> 26:08.858
WeII, we were dancing around
a few other things, too.

26:08.943 --> 26:12.028
No, we weren't.
This is what you're gonna see tomorrow.

26:12.112 --> 26:13.613
It's a once-in-a-Iifetime idea.

26:13.906 --> 26:16.824
Raymond, you couId save yourseIf a trip
to the office tomorrow

26:16.909 --> 26:19.452
or we can get in the eIevator,
go down 1 1 fIoors

26:19.536 --> 26:21.621
and show you the work right now.

26:24.124 --> 26:25.708
It's the future.

26:26.710 --> 26:28.586
That's aII I ever wanted.

26:30.464 --> 26:33.174
ShouId we change
that Sauternes to champagne?

26:35.761 --> 26:37.679
Sure, why the heII not?

26:46.480 --> 26:48.231
72nd and Park.

26:54.321 --> 26:56.447
Do you know you're good at aII of it?

26:57.491 --> 27:02.495
You had the idea, feeding me the pitch,
knowing to puII the trigger at that moment.

27:03.330 --> 27:05.206
I was just gonna scream in his stupid face.

27:05.958 --> 27:07.417
I'm gIad you didn't.

27:07.501 --> 27:09.544
I Iove the way you soId that.

27:09.670 --> 27:11.671
Oh, my God.

27:13.173 --> 27:15.008
I want you.

27:16.677 --> 27:21.514
But we have to go back to the house
with the kids and your parents.

27:23.600 --> 27:25.810
We can go back to the office.

27:26.729 --> 27:29.564
Change of pIans. Back to Time-Life, pIease.

27:50.336 --> 27:52.712
There's champagne in the conference room.

27:52.796 --> 27:55.256
Don and Megan soId Heinz
Iast night over dinner.

27:58.469 --> 28:02.430
But, by Iooking at your fingers,
maybe you're not in the mood to ceIebrate.

28:02.806 --> 28:05.266
No, of course.

28:07.394 --> 28:09.020
It was better than that.

28:09.396 --> 28:10.772
ReaIIy?

28:11.398 --> 28:13.858
We're moving in together.

28:13.942 --> 28:15.193
He asked me.

28:15.402 --> 28:17.779
Shacking up?

28:17.863 --> 28:19.072
My goodness.

28:19.656 --> 28:21.366
I know, but...

28:21.450 --> 28:22.784
No, Peggy.

28:24.953 --> 28:26.245
Good for you.

28:27.122 --> 28:28.331
ReaIIy?

28:29.750 --> 28:31.167
You're not just saying that?

28:31.251 --> 28:32.293
No.

28:32.878 --> 28:34.337
I don't know.

28:35.047 --> 28:38.299
Sounds Iike he wants to be with you
no matter what.

28:40.636 --> 28:43.096
I thought you were going
to be disappointed for me.

28:43.430 --> 28:45.181
I think it's very romantic.

28:46.433 --> 28:48.017
It is, isn't it?

28:49.770 --> 28:52.855
We don't need a piece of paper.

28:52.940 --> 28:54.941
I mean, not that marriage
is wrong or anything.

28:55.442 --> 28:57.193
Greg has a piece of paper with the US Army

28:57.277 --> 29:00.029
that's more important
than the one he has with me.

29:01.698 --> 29:02.949
I'm sorry.

29:03.117 --> 29:04.951
It is what it is.

29:05.869 --> 29:07.662
I think you're brave.

29:09.581 --> 29:12.875
I think it's a beautifuI statement.
CongratuIations.

29:19.383 --> 29:22.677
So Megan comes out and does
a doubIe secret reverse to Don that it's over.

29:22.761 --> 29:25.346
Then they just passed it back and forth
Iike a coupIe of pros.

29:25.431 --> 29:27.056
You weren't even there.

29:27.141 --> 29:28.266
Way to go.

29:28.350 --> 29:30.184
You shouId be shaking her hand.

29:30.269 --> 29:31.644
It's just beginner's Iuck.

29:33.147 --> 29:34.272
So, the Hemisphere CIub...

29:34.356 --> 29:37.525
-I'm gonna go teII Peggy.
-TeII everybody.

29:37.734 --> 29:39.402
You want the pIeasure of teIIing Lane?

29:39.486 --> 29:40.695
No, you earned it.

29:41.155 --> 29:44.907
Besides, we're stiII at Ieast 1 5 grand
out of pocket on the account.

29:50.664 --> 29:52.748
Megan! CongratuIations.

29:53.750 --> 29:54.917
-You heard.
-Yeah.

29:55.002 --> 29:56.752
Joan toId me Harry said you signed Heinz.

29:58.297 --> 29:59.755
I don't want to take aII the credit.

30:00.299 --> 30:02.675
Why aren't you jumping up and down?

30:02.759 --> 30:04.760
I don't know what
the Canadian equivaIent of basebaII is,

30:04.845 --> 30:06.095
but this is a home run.

30:06.555 --> 30:07.597
We have basebaII.

30:07.681 --> 30:09.640
WeII, this is a home run.

30:09.725 --> 30:12.518
I know what you did, and it is a big deaI.

30:12.603 --> 30:15.313
And when it happened to me,
they acted Iike it happens aII the time.

30:15.397 --> 30:16.481
It doesn't.

30:18.275 --> 30:20.359
I tried to crack that nut.

30:20.444 --> 30:22.612
I mean, if anything, I shouId be jeaIous.

30:23.947 --> 30:26.240
But I Iook at you and I feeI Iike,

30:27.367 --> 30:31.078
I don't know,
I'm getting to experience my first time again.

30:32.372 --> 30:34.207
It's a good day for me.

30:36.043 --> 30:38.669
This is as good as this job gets.

30:40.047 --> 30:41.422
Savor it.

30:43.884 --> 30:46.844
You're right. I wiII.

30:54.895 --> 30:57.396
Good morning, EmiIe. Where is everyone?

30:58.232 --> 31:02.527
The girIs went out and Bobby is heIping me
fiII my fountain pen.

31:05.572 --> 31:07.990
Thanks, EmiIe.

31:08.075 --> 31:09.325
HeIIo.

31:14.039 --> 31:17.291
It's not as bad as you think,
but it's pretty bad.

31:17.376 --> 31:19.710
-SaIIy.
-Go ahead.

31:19.795 --> 31:22.630
Papa, can I come with you
to see you get your award tonight?

31:23.423 --> 31:24.799
Papa?

31:26.218 --> 31:27.385
I don't know.

31:27.469 --> 31:30.096
I got a dress. PIease?

31:30.180 --> 31:33.057
Every daughter shouId get
to see her father as a success.

31:47.114 --> 31:48.197
It's fine.

31:48.282 --> 31:49.448
Sweetheart, of course you can go.

31:49.908 --> 31:52.285
Thank you, Daddy.
Can I show you my dress?

31:56.582 --> 31:59.292
Bobby, put that away.
You two watch TV or something.

32:05.382 --> 32:07.174
What was that about?

32:11.138 --> 32:15.850
My father went to his pubIisher this morning
and was back within the hour.

32:15.934 --> 32:18.185
And then he got on the phone
with CIaudette,

32:18.270 --> 32:20.146
his Iatest grad student.

32:20.230 --> 32:24.400
My mother waIked in.
He was crying, apparentIy.

32:24.484 --> 32:27.528
WeII, he's got a Iot wrapped up in that book.

32:27.613 --> 32:30.281
He shouId be crying to my mother, Don.

32:32.951 --> 32:34.118
Right.

32:35.954 --> 32:37.663
What about tonight?

32:38.999 --> 32:42.585
They do this aII the time.
They'II recover. They aIways do.

32:50.844 --> 32:52.762
Honey, it's reaIIy hot.

33:00.103 --> 33:01.854
Wait.

33:13.617 --> 33:15.117
Hi, Ma. Come in.

33:15.202 --> 33:16.744
HeIIo, peaches.

33:17.871 --> 33:18.996
Abraham.

33:19.539 --> 33:20.915
HeIIo, Katherine.

33:22.084 --> 33:23.751
You brought dessert.

33:23.835 --> 33:27.713
Just Ieave it in the box.
I'II take it out. It's very deIicate.

33:28.965 --> 33:31.509
-You want some sherry?
-Sure.

33:34.721 --> 33:36.514
SmeIIs good in here.

33:36.598 --> 33:39.767
Peggy made a ham. It's my favorite.

33:39.851 --> 33:41.268
ReaIIy?

33:47.609 --> 33:49.985
-Are you babysitting?
-No.

33:51.613 --> 33:53.906
-HeIIo.
-HeIIo.

33:53.990 --> 33:58.536
Roger SterIing,
this is Dr. EmiIe and Marie CaIvet.

33:58.620 --> 34:00.996
-You Iadies Iook ravishing.
-Thank you.

34:01.081 --> 34:02.665
Can I get you a drink?

34:02.749 --> 34:04.583
No. I mean, yes.

34:04.668 --> 34:06.544
But does anyone know
how to tie this thing?

34:06.628 --> 34:08.045
Here.

34:08.130 --> 34:10.756
I'm stag tonight
and my doorman wears a cIip-on.

34:12.551 --> 34:14.301
I am surprised.

34:15.721 --> 34:18.264
You seem Iike you were born in a bow tie.

34:18.348 --> 34:19.807
I didn't tie that one either.

34:22.394 --> 34:24.603
Good evening, everyone.

34:25.188 --> 34:26.272
My God.

34:31.111 --> 34:33.028
SaIIy, you Iook so beautifuI.

34:34.573 --> 34:35.614
You're beautifuI, sweetheart.

34:37.325 --> 34:38.951
Don, there is nothing you can do.

34:39.327 --> 34:43.372
No matter what, one day your IittIe girI
wiII spread her Iegs and fIy away.

34:45.125 --> 34:46.625
What? It's true.

34:46.793 --> 34:47.877
"Wings," Daddy.

34:50.547 --> 34:52.256
Take off the makeup and the boots.

34:52.883 --> 34:54.258
What? No.

34:55.010 --> 34:56.594
Or you can stay home.

34:58.638 --> 34:59.930
Fine.

35:11.026 --> 35:13.027
This is the baIIroom?

35:13.111 --> 35:15.029
There's no staircase.

35:15.113 --> 35:16.322
But here's a handsome prince.

35:18.366 --> 35:19.658
Nah.

35:19.868 --> 35:22.244
HeIIo, aII. Don't you Iook IoveIy?

35:22.329 --> 35:24.580
I hope you don't mind
if I steaI your father for a moment.

35:24.998 --> 35:27.625
I'd Iove for you to meet Ed Baxter,
Ken's father-in-Iaw.

35:27.918 --> 35:29.043
No, of course.

35:29.127 --> 35:31.504
Megan, couId you join us?

35:31.588 --> 35:33.214
I got 'em.

35:36.468 --> 35:38.636
Ed, Don Draper, his wife Megan.

35:38.720 --> 35:41.180
PIeased to meet you. Both of you.

35:42.307 --> 35:44.850
-I guess I shouId thank you for this.
-No, don't thank me.

35:45.101 --> 35:47.603
I had to recuse myseIf.

35:47.687 --> 35:50.022
But you write some stirring copy.

35:50.982 --> 35:53.275
ActuaIIy, Megan's a heII of a copywriter
as weII.

35:53.360 --> 35:58.113
WeII, I shouId Iie, but Cynthia toId me
aII about your dinner.

35:58.198 --> 36:01.033
-She's a naturaI.
-Thank you.

36:06.248 --> 36:09.375
-Who's he?
-His name is Ed. He's at Dow Corning.

36:09.668 --> 36:12.545
They make beautifuI dishes,
gIassware, napaIm.

36:13.338 --> 36:14.880
-Peter CampbeII.
-EmiIe.

36:15.215 --> 36:16.966
And his wife's name is LiIIian.

36:17.050 --> 36:19.301
-Don't forget that.
-I won't.

36:19.386 --> 36:23.305
And those two over there,
the baIding guy with Margaret Dumont,

36:23.390 --> 36:24.807
he's at GM.

36:24.891 --> 36:26.642
Where's your purse?

36:28.270 --> 36:29.645
You're gonna be my date.

36:29.729 --> 36:31.397
Every business card I bring back,

36:31.481 --> 36:34.066
you're gonna put it in your purse
and say, "Go get 'em, tiger."

36:35.902 --> 36:37.778
So I manage those accounts.

36:37.863 --> 36:42.116
I don't understand.
What do you do every day?

36:43.201 --> 36:44.326
WeII, what do you do?

36:44.578 --> 36:46.954
You're a schoIar and an inteIIectuaI, right?

36:47.581 --> 36:48.706
Yes.

36:48.790 --> 36:51.458
ActuaIIy, from what I hear,
you're a bit of a traiIbIazer.

36:52.168 --> 36:54.503
I don't know if that's true.

36:55.255 --> 36:58.048
I bet the worId wouId be better off
if they knew about the work you're doing.

36:59.676 --> 37:01.635
You are very kind.

37:03.221 --> 37:04.930
That, EmiIe,

37:05.473 --> 37:07.433
is what I do every day.

37:11.646 --> 37:13.856
Shit. I've got to beat the entrée. Cover me.

37:16.318 --> 37:18.444
Your date is very resourcefuI.

37:39.966 --> 37:41.842
PIease. I got this.

37:45.722 --> 37:47.890
I'm sorry, honey.
I wasn't gonna Ieave before dessert,

37:47.974 --> 37:49.642
but this is taking a IittIe Ionger
than I thought.

37:56.107 --> 37:57.316
WeII...

38:00.695 --> 38:02.780
We have something we want to teII you.

38:02.864 --> 38:04.073
ReaIIy?

38:05.325 --> 38:08.577
Abe and I are very serious about each other

38:08.662 --> 38:11.705
and we've decided
we're going to Iive together.

38:12.832 --> 38:14.249
What?

38:14.334 --> 38:17.294
Listen. I know you may not approve,

38:17.379 --> 38:22.049
but it's important to me that you understand
what we're doing.

38:23.760 --> 38:26.178
I wiII take very good care of her.

38:29.349 --> 38:31.308
You know what?

38:31.393 --> 38:32.768
I'm gonna go.

38:33.979 --> 38:35.020
What?

38:35.355 --> 38:36.981
I'm gonna go.

38:37.691 --> 38:39.316
I need my cake.

38:39.609 --> 38:40.693
Why?

38:41.194 --> 38:45.030
Because I'm not giving you a cake
to ceIebrate youse Iiving in sin.

38:46.866 --> 38:48.325
WouId you rather I not teII you?

38:48.410 --> 38:51.120
Yeah. You want to stick it in my face?

38:51.204 --> 38:54.832
Just Iie. You think you're the first ones ever
to do this?

38:57.127 --> 39:00.254
-Ma.
-What do you want from me?

39:00.338 --> 39:04.091
I'm gonna get you a cab.

39:06.344 --> 39:08.137
I invited you here as an aduIt

39:08.221 --> 39:11.181
because I didn't want to Iie
and I want you in my Iife.

39:11.266 --> 39:14.059
WeII, if you're an aduIt,
why do you care what I think?

39:14.477 --> 39:16.437
I thought you'd be reIieved
I wasn't marrying the Jew.

39:16.521 --> 39:18.814
It has nothing to do with that!

39:20.066 --> 39:21.191
It's my fauIt.

39:21.276 --> 39:23.861
Because once your father died,
there was no one to set you straight.

39:23.945 --> 39:25.946
I know what I'm doing.

39:26.031 --> 39:27.948
And I think Daddy wouId want me
to be happy.

39:28.033 --> 39:31.410
No. He'd be mad at you the same way I am,

39:31.494 --> 39:34.121
because you are seIIing yourseIf short.

39:34.205 --> 39:37.833
This boy, he wiII use you for practice

39:37.917 --> 39:41.170
untiI he decides to get married
and have a famiIy.

39:41.254 --> 39:43.255
And he wiII, beIieve me.

39:45.884 --> 39:47.843
You want me to be aIone?

39:51.848 --> 39:54.391
You know what your aunt used to say?

39:57.187 --> 39:59.563
"You're IoneIy, get a cat."

40:00.815 --> 40:02.691
They Iive 1 3 years,

40:02.776 --> 40:06.028
then you get another one
and another one after that.

40:06.112 --> 40:07.738
Then you're done.

40:09.741 --> 40:11.533
Thank you for dinner.

40:17.499 --> 40:19.583
AII of us here
appreciate your years of service.

40:20.043 --> 40:21.126
Baked AIaska.

40:21.419 --> 40:23.796
It's fIaming, but they probabIy don't want
to wreck the speeches.

40:23.880 --> 40:25.214
You're wrecking the speeches.

40:25.298 --> 40:27.508
You're a mean drunk. You know that?

40:29.594 --> 40:32.262
From the Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce
advertising firm...

40:32.347 --> 40:35.140
-Your daddy's next.
-...Mr. Donald Draper.

40:37.352 --> 40:38.685
Thank you.

40:42.816 --> 40:44.608
ShouIdn't I be at his side?

40:44.692 --> 40:46.360
Go get 'em, tiger.

40:58.081 --> 40:59.540
Can I see it?

41:07.549 --> 41:08.841
Do you want it?

41:08.925 --> 41:12.010
No, you shouId keep it
because it makes you reaIIy happy.

41:15.348 --> 41:16.932
You know what makes me happy?

41:17.392 --> 41:20.978
A beautifuI young Iady who wiII someday
be wearing makeup, but not today.

41:27.819 --> 41:28.986
I got you a ShirIey TempIe.

41:29.070 --> 41:31.572
It's time to start tapering off.

41:31.656 --> 41:35.909
And, Don, I promised Frank
from Ford over there you'd come and say hi.

41:53.720 --> 41:56.722
I'd buy you a drink,
but I think they're stiII free.

41:58.308 --> 42:00.642
I have been watching you aII night.

42:03.062 --> 42:06.315
You're so fuII of Iife and ambition.

42:06.399 --> 42:09.651
WeII, I've gotten a Iot of rejection,
so who knows what I'm fuII of?

42:11.404 --> 42:16.700
When I was younger,
it was my spirit to try everything,

42:16.784 --> 42:18.202
get a taste, know what was what,

42:18.286 --> 42:21.496
and never be sorry for making the mistakes.

42:21.581 --> 42:26.210
And then one day,
I made too many mistakes.

42:26.294 --> 42:28.253
Where was I that day?

42:29.130 --> 42:32.090
Inside you is a IittIe boy.

42:32.175 --> 42:35.844
WeII, Marie, I woke up one day and I reaIized

42:35.929 --> 42:38.472
at what point shouId you ever stop trying?

42:40.266 --> 42:42.100
I agree.

42:43.102 --> 42:45.520
We shouId have everything we want.

42:48.942 --> 42:51.860
I'm going to the Iadies' room.
Can you watch the award?

42:51.945 --> 42:53.153
I got it.

43:02.121 --> 43:04.414
Daddy, I'm gIad you came.

43:04.916 --> 43:06.667
Then why do you Iook so sad?

43:07.418 --> 43:09.503
I'm not. I'm just tired.

43:10.630 --> 43:12.297
It's been a busy week.

43:12.674 --> 43:15.342
Yes, you have a big beans success.

43:15.635 --> 43:18.595
Don't make fun, Papa.
I know you don't approve.

43:19.847 --> 43:21.890
Is this your passion?

43:24.852 --> 43:26.311
Because you have changed.

43:27.814 --> 43:29.773
I aIways thought
you were very singIe-minded

43:29.857 --> 43:33.318
about your dreams
and that that wouId heIp you through Iife.

43:33.403 --> 43:38.073
But now I see that you skipped the struggIe
and went right to the end.

43:38.157 --> 43:41.076
It's not the end. It's the beginning.

43:41.369 --> 43:45.038
This apartment,
this weaIth that someone handed to you,

43:45.123 --> 43:47.165
this was what KarI Marx was taIking about.

43:47.250 --> 43:49.751
And it's not because
someone eIse deserves it,

43:49.836 --> 43:52.587
it's because it is bad for your souI.

43:52.672 --> 43:56.883
Don't beat me with your poIitics
because you hate that I Iove Don.

43:57.176 --> 43:59.303
No, I hate that you gave up.

44:01.514 --> 44:05.350
Don't Iet your Iove for this man
stop you from doing what you wanted to do.

44:41.012 --> 44:42.095
Excuse me.

44:42.180 --> 44:45.599
I've been teIIing Ken you shouId get out
of your business aItogether.

44:45.892 --> 44:47.392
Why is that?

44:52.815 --> 44:56.360
I'd introduce you to him,
but I don't want you to waste your time.

44:56.861 --> 44:59.654
He's on the board.
He obviousIy Iikes my work.

44:59.739 --> 45:00.781
He Ioves your work.

45:01.199 --> 45:03.158
They aII do.

45:03.242 --> 45:06.078
-But they don't Iike you.
-What?

45:06.162 --> 45:07.829
This crowd,

45:07.914 --> 45:11.124
they'II bury your desk in awards,

45:11.209 --> 45:15.170
but they'II never work with you,
not after that Ietter.

45:15.254 --> 45:18.298
I mean, how couId they trust you
after the way you bit the hand?

45:23.763 --> 45:26.973
Sorry about that. You want another?

45:30.812 --> 45:33.772
-Yeah, sure.
-Two.

46:01.884 --> 46:03.760
Excuse me, miss.
Are you finished with that?

46:03.845 --> 46:04.970
Yes.

46:14.272 --> 46:15.730
-Yeah?
-Did I wake you?

46:16.441 --> 46:17.691
Yeah, but it's okay.

46:18.317 --> 46:19.818
I get a Iot of attention every time you caII.

46:20.611 --> 46:22.154
PeopIe think you're my girIfriend.

46:22.947 --> 46:24.322
I'm not.

46:24.991 --> 46:26.324
Why are you whispering?

46:26.909 --> 46:29.244
I'm in Manhattan at my dad's.

46:29.328 --> 46:30.787
BIuto broke her foot.

46:31.622 --> 46:32.956
SpectacuIar.

46:33.416 --> 46:34.916
Yeah.

46:36.002 --> 46:37.669
How's the city?

46:39.130 --> 46:40.297
Dirty.
