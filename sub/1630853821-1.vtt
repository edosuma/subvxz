Grant Application

01:10.625 --> 01:12.709
I can do it

01:18.125 --> 01:20.959
Wake up, idiot!

01:21.625 --> 01:26.208
Idiot, wake up!

01:50.542 --> 01:51.417
I love it.

01:51.709 --> 01:52.917
I love it, too.

02:02.583 --> 02:04.125
I’m better than her, right?

02:04.208 --> 02:05.458
Of course.

02:10.583 --> 02:12.500
Then why are you marrying her?

02:12.583 --> 02:13.625
I’m coming.

02:15.667 --> 02:18.041
Hey, look at me

02:18.375 --> 02:20.625
- Huh?
- and tell me that I’m pretty...

02:20.709 --> 02:25.000
I wanted to impress you

02:25.083 --> 02:28.583
so I wore a skirt for the first time

02:38.500 --> 02:39.625
You okay, honey?

02:57.333 --> 02:58.333
Screw you.

03:06.792 --> 03:10.542
The exact same dream every time...

03:11.625 --> 03:13.458
Aren’t you sick of it, Ja-young?

03:18.542 --> 03:21.375
It’s not only 15-year-old boys
who have wet dreams.

03:21.917 --> 03:24.542
A 29-year-old woman can have one too.
The only difference is

03:25.667 --> 03:30.291
you don’t need to feel embarrassed.

03:37.166 --> 03:41.458
Ja-young, find Mr. Right on LOVE BRIDGE
and make the new year richer ♥♥♥

03:44.083 --> 03:47.125
NOTHING SERIOUS

03:47.667 --> 03:51.959
Why do people read magazines?

03:54.542 --> 03:57.333
Tell me. Anyone?

03:59.709 --> 04:01.083
Go on, Hyung-joon.

04:01.166 --> 04:05.959
At the forefront of trend, magazines
provide accurate and useful—

04:06.041 --> 04:06.667
Next.

04:12.458 --> 04:15.709
Along with information,
we stimulate guilty pleasure—

04:15.792 --> 04:17.625
Haven’t you been here longer than him?

04:17.709 --> 04:19.667
How come you’re on the exact same level?

04:20.750 --> 04:21.166
Next!

04:21.250 --> 04:25.208
We create a friendly atmosphere
that leads to purchases—

04:25.291 --> 04:25.959
That’s it!

04:26.041 --> 04:27.125
- Yes.
- Spot on.

04:27.792 --> 04:31.417
Create the feeling of an old friend

04:31.500 --> 04:33.041
who really understands you!

04:33.667 --> 04:35.709
Because they’re bored?

04:35.792 --> 04:36.959
Correct, darling.

04:37.250 --> 04:41.959
You read magazines to kill time
because life is unbearably dull!

04:42.792 --> 04:46.333
But what if it’s a dull read?
Is that acceptable?

04:46.792 --> 04:51.166
If you can’t write a fabulous story,
then find a writer who can!

04:51.250 --> 04:54.625
Or get yourself into a spectacular mess.

04:55.083 --> 04:57.875
Choi Macho, who quit last month,

04:58.792 --> 05:01.667
launched an independent webzine
and hit the jackpot.

05:03.083 --> 05:11.000
Remember how he got so obsessed
with his sex column on sex toys

05:11.083 --> 05:14.083
that he ended up going to a urologist?

05:14.417 --> 05:16.375
I’m afraid it has lost its function.

05:16.458 --> 05:19.625
I was so moved by his passion
I expensed his treatment.

05:22.500 --> 05:25.500
His webzine is all the
craze on social media.

05:26.959 --> 05:32.208
That’s what magazines are about.
Engage the readers’ attention with clickbait,

05:32.291 --> 05:35.834
then make them furious, cry, and laugh!

05:35.917 --> 05:39.959
What, they broke up again?
Oh my God, what happened?

05:40.041 --> 05:42.375
I heard from my friend’s cousin’s
distant relative yada yada…

05:42.458 --> 05:44.083
blah blah blah…

05:44.166 --> 05:46.125
yada yada blah blah...

05:48.709 --> 05:49.667
Woori.

05:52.375 --> 05:53.041
Yes, chief.

05:54.083 --> 05:57.959
Why are you still here
when Choi Macho has left?

05:59.083 --> 05:59.667
Excuse me?

05:59.750 --> 06:03.333
I heard some of his old colleagues
helped him with the launch.

06:03.417 --> 06:05.792
I haven’t talked to him in a while.

06:05.875 --> 06:08.458
Whatever. Take over his sex column.

06:08.542 --> 06:09.250
Me?

06:09.542 --> 06:10.500
But I’m doing the culture section.

06:10.583 --> 06:11.583
Isn’t sex culture?

06:11.667 --> 06:13.083
I’m also writing the sports column.

06:13.166 --> 06:14.417
Isn’t sex sports?

06:14.500 --> 06:15.667
I was asked by the politics department—

06:15.750 --> 06:17.166
Isn’t sex politics?

06:19.417 --> 06:23.208
You majored in creative writing, right?

06:23.959 --> 06:26.750
It’s shitty you’re stuck
writing for a magazine, huh?

06:27.125 --> 06:27.709
Not at all.

06:27.792 --> 06:31.834
- On my desk by holiday’s end.
- Yes, chief.

06:34.500 --> 06:35.667
Have a good day.

07:01.166 --> 07:02.792
Would you like this seat?

07:03.125 --> 07:06.458
Give me your hands.
They’re warm.

07:06.542 --> 07:07.333
Honey,

07:07.709 --> 07:09.166
let me tidy up your hair.

07:09.250 --> 07:10.458
Is that okay?

07:10.667 --> 07:12.458
I love you.

07:14.041 --> 07:15.125
I love you, too.

07:19.250 --> 07:22.542
What? You’re sick of me?

07:22.750 --> 07:23.750
Yes, I am!

07:23.959 --> 07:25.500
I thought you’d be hot and cool,

07:25.583 --> 07:29.709
but you’re an alcoholic nympho
with delusional jealousy

07:29.792 --> 07:31.250
like Kathy Bates in Misery!

07:31.709 --> 07:33.458
Fine, let’s break up.

07:33.750 --> 07:35.625
But you should really see a doctor

07:36.125 --> 07:37.041
for your premature ejaculation.

07:37.125 --> 07:38.166
Did you hear that?

07:38.250 --> 07:39.333
- He has PE.
- Oh, shit...

07:39.875 --> 07:43.458
I hope you can find treatment
and meet someone nice.

07:47.583 --> 07:48.667
Ham Ja-young!

07:49.917 --> 07:50.667
Ham Ja-young!

07:52.041 --> 07:53.291
Hey, watch it.

07:58.625 --> 08:00.458
Ja-young, find Mr. Right on LOVE BRIDGE
and make the new year richer ♥♥♥

08:00.542 --> 08:02.709
Damn this alert!

08:14.041 --> 08:14.750
Hey, dad.

08:16.333 --> 08:20.125
Can you make more takeout boxes?
The gimbap place is closed today.

08:20.208 --> 08:21.875
We’ll be really busy today.

08:21.959 --> 08:22.875
Okay.

08:25.166 --> 08:28.375
Hey, are you free this Saturday?

08:28.709 --> 08:29.375
Why?

08:29.834 --> 08:32.125
Grandma’s in the hospital.

08:32.417 --> 08:32.834
What?

08:32.917 --> 08:36.166
She sprained her back
getting off the bus.

08:36.250 --> 08:38.041
- Is she okay?
- She’s fine.

08:38.125 --> 08:42.834
She has a lot of friends there,
so it’s a party.

08:42.917 --> 08:45.458
Oh, grandma...

08:45.959 --> 08:49.542
Don’t “Oh, grandma” me.

08:50.083 --> 08:56.083
You bothered her for your podcast,
and now, you don’t call her.

08:56.166 --> 08:59.041
I was going to call.

08:59.458 --> 09:03.625
I almost forgot.
This came for you.

09:06.667 --> 09:07.709
Korea Youth Start-up Agency

09:11.375 --> 09:13.542
Application Result

09:14.083 --> 09:16.125
Grant Approved

09:17.500 --> 09:18.166
Dad!

09:18.250 --> 09:19.542
What? What is it?

09:19.667 --> 09:21.500
I got it!

09:22.875 --> 09:25.959
Dad!
I’m so happy!

09:26.041 --> 09:26.750
Is it good?

09:26.834 --> 09:28.875
It’s really really good!

09:29.458 --> 09:32.041
Choi Macho

09:36.583 --> 09:38.166
Special Thanks to
Choi Jinsu, Park Woori, Son Youngmi

09:38.417 --> 09:39.583
Idiot!

09:50.917 --> 09:52.208
Hey, Yeon-hee.

09:52.291 --> 09:53.875
Hi, Woori.

09:57.417 --> 09:58.792
Did you get home alright last night?

09:58.875 --> 10:01.041
Of course, thanks to you.

10:01.125 --> 10:02.041
Good.

10:03.250 --> 10:05.458
Did you... want coffee?

10:05.625 --> 10:07.041
No, I’m good.

10:11.333 --> 10:16.041
I don’t want you to worry about the column.
It’s really not my kind of stuff—

10:17.041 --> 10:18.125
Huh?

10:18.208 --> 10:19.625
Why would I worry about that?

10:23.083 --> 10:23.959
You know...

10:25.417 --> 10:27.875
- Oh, and...
- I wanted to tell you...

10:28.250 --> 10:29.792
I’m getting engaged.

10:30.208 --> 10:32.500
My boyfriend came back last month.

10:34.000 --> 10:37.625
I didn’t mean to hide it from you.
We’d actually broken up.

10:38.375 --> 10:44.834
Anyway, I feel I owe you so much.
I enjoyed your company, too.

10:47.417 --> 10:48.417
See you around.

10:49.625 --> 10:51.875
Bitch on the Beach - The Musical

10:53.375 --> 10:56.959
Ja-young’s celebratory drink is on me.

10:58.375 --> 10:59.834
Woo-sung!

11:00.125 --> 11:02.041
- Thanks, man.
- You’re so handsome.

11:02.375 --> 11:03.291
Excuse me!

11:04.083 --> 11:06.375
- I’ll be right back.
- The food is so good.

11:06.458 --> 11:11.333
Congratulations!
I told you you’d make it.

11:11.417 --> 11:14.834
No, you said the exact opposite.
You said it’s a failure in the making.

11:14.917 --> 11:19.291
Thank you all for being happy for me!
At 29, friends are all I have.

11:19.375 --> 11:20.041
Cheers!

11:20.125 --> 11:22.583
What about Min-seok?

11:24.667 --> 11:26.041
Now, who’s that?

11:26.125 --> 11:28.166
Your boyfriend of one month?

11:28.959 --> 11:29.959
What did I miss?

11:31.500 --> 11:33.875
You broke up with him already?

11:40.375 --> 11:42.625
Yeon-hee is getting engaged?

11:44.208 --> 11:46.250
But she’s been sleeping with you all along.

11:46.500 --> 11:48.625
Women are scary creatures.

11:49.000 --> 11:50.542
It’s all your fault.

11:50.625 --> 11:53.667
If only I didn’t get that stupid sex column.

11:54.709 --> 11:55.834
No, she’s lying.

11:56.709 --> 11:57.250
What about?

11:57.333 --> 12:01.291
She lied about getting engaged
because you’re terrible in bed.

12:01.375 --> 12:03.959
Will you cut the crap, please?

12:04.041 --> 12:06.625
It’s bitter, isn’t it?

12:07.625 --> 12:11.750
I kind of knew you were terrible in bed.
No surprise there.

12:11.834 --> 12:13.500
Shut your mouth, wank maniac.

12:13.583 --> 12:16.291
What did you call me, mad dick?

12:16.625 --> 12:18.250
Never mind, just look here.

12:19.083 --> 12:20.583
Give me a pose.

12:20.667 --> 12:22.750
- What are you doing? I’m tired.
- Come on.

12:22.834 --> 12:24.500
- Cut it out.
- I said pose!

12:24.583 --> 12:26.583
- Just one good pose!
- Cut it out, man.

12:27.500 --> 12:30.291
I like it!
It makes your dick look huge.

12:30.375 --> 12:32.542
Do you want to screw up your life?

12:32.625 --> 12:33.917
Start a relationship.

12:34.000 --> 12:37.875
The secret to happiness is
not being in a relationship.

12:38.208 --> 12:39.375
Simple as that.

12:40.417 --> 12:44.291
Can we go back to the wet dream story?

12:44.542 --> 12:48.166
I woke up right before orgasm.

12:48.250 --> 12:50.333
By the way,
how come it’s better in your dreams?

12:50.417 --> 12:53.166
It’s so damn hard to cum in real life,

12:53.250 --> 12:56.667
but in dreams, all my senses are awake.

12:56.959 --> 12:57.917
So good.

12:57.959 --> 12:59.709
Alright, that’s enough.

12:59.792 --> 13:03.709
I heard sex dreams are associated with money.

13:03.792 --> 13:04.709
Should I buy lottery tickets?

13:04.792 --> 13:07.208
No, a sex dream means
you want to have sex.

13:07.291 --> 13:10.709
Can we have some class, girls?

13:10.792 --> 13:13.125
My hubby would freak out
if he heard this conversation.

13:13.208 --> 13:15.709
What hubby?

13:15.792 --> 13:18.542
You never know till
you walk down the aisle.

13:18.625 --> 13:20.208
Hmm... fuck off.

13:20.291 --> 13:24.667
I’m the best divorce lawyer you can find.
I’d be happy to represent you.

13:24.750 --> 13:27.333
I will never require your services.
Thank you.

13:27.875 --> 13:28.875
She’s so annoying.

13:28.959 --> 13:30.166
Excuse me!

13:31.417 --> 13:36.709
No more X-rated talks until I come back,
only R-rated.

13:36.792 --> 13:37.709
Okay.

13:42.291 --> 13:44.917
What do you want from a relationship?

13:44.959 --> 13:46.834
Love, or do you simply miss dick?

13:46.959 --> 13:50.917
I read somewhere
love is in your head in your teens,

13:50.959 --> 13:56.166
in your heart in your 20s
and below the belly button in your 30s.

13:56.250 --> 13:59.333
This big-cock-implying picture is good.

13:59.417 --> 14:01.500
- What’s your blood type?
- Type O.

14:01.583 --> 14:03.834
- Your epitaph?
- I don’t have one.

14:03.959 --> 14:06.583
Then you gotta make one,
one that stands out.

14:06.667 --> 14:08.792
“Lived a lazy life very diligently.”

14:08.834 --> 14:10.166
That’s good! But no.

14:10.250 --> 14:11.542
“Fuck the Korean school system”?

14:11.625 --> 14:12.709
I like that too, but no.

14:12.792 --> 14:14.959
“Are you that tough?
Meet me on the roof.”

14:15.083 --> 14:15.959
That’s not it.

14:16.458 --> 14:18.834
Roof... outside... sex?

14:18.875 --> 14:22.458
Outdoor sex?
We’re getting somewhere.

14:22.542 --> 14:23.959
Meet me on the roof.

14:24.083 --> 14:24.875
Okay.

14:25.291 --> 14:26.291
And done!

14:31.333 --> 14:32.792
Snow White, 23

14:36.834 --> 14:37.875
Dammit.

14:37.959 --> 14:39.166
Ja-young, find Mr. Right on LOVE BRIDGE
and make the new year richer ♥♥♥

14:39.250 --> 14:40.625
The stupid same alert again.

14:40.709 --> 14:41.500
What is it?

14:42.375 --> 14:44.583
Do you know ‘LOVE BRIDGE’?

14:44.667 --> 14:46.417
Why do you have that app?

14:46.500 --> 14:50.291
I downloaded it out of rage
after breaking up last night.

14:50.375 --> 14:52.291
It’s sending alerts nonstop.

14:52.375 --> 14:53.583
A dating app?

14:54.125 --> 14:58.709
A friend from college met
a teacher with this and got married.

14:58.792 --> 15:00.834
Apparently, you can find good ones, too.

15:00.917 --> 15:02.583
What good ones?

15:02.667 --> 15:04.542
It’s an app for those who crave sex

15:04.625 --> 15:07.625
and want to have an
awkward, shady meetup that ends dirty.

15:07.875 --> 15:09.375
How about,
“Good old-fashioned holiday fling”?

15:09.458 --> 15:11.291
What the hell, man?

15:11.375 --> 15:15.667
You got dumped and have a column to write.
That’s two birds with one stone.

15:16.709 --> 15:22.083
Don’t feel all alone on a holiday.
Find your match on LOVE BRIDGE

15:22.166 --> 15:24.250
and make your new year fuller.

15:24.792 --> 15:27.125
Fuller... full boobs.

15:28.041 --> 15:28.917
Are you crazy?

15:29.000 --> 15:33.041
Do you want to meet some psycho,
get raped, murdered, then dismembered?

15:33.291 --> 15:36.417
Just delete the app.
You’ll be 30 next year.

15:36.500 --> 15:39.291
You can’t keep getting into bad relationships.

15:39.375 --> 15:42.500
You just haven’t met the one like I have.

15:42.542 --> 15:45.959
You meet the one and live happily ever after.

15:46.208 --> 15:48.458
Are you listening to me?

15:48.542 --> 15:49.125
What?

15:49.208 --> 15:54.250
I refuse to waste energy on such an
emotion-draining activity like love.

15:54.458 --> 15:55.375
Do as you please.

15:55.458 --> 15:58.041
Even Shakespeare defined love
as a mental illness.

15:58.125 --> 16:00.750
You can’t love people these days.

16:01.417 --> 16:06.375
They come with all kinds of
emotional baggage.

16:06.458 --> 16:09.458
You end up seeing the worst
in each other and break up.

16:09.542 --> 16:14.542
You know, women can’t stand
to see the men they’ve dumped end up happy.

16:14.625 --> 16:16.834
So I’m supposed to find happiness here?

16:16.917 --> 16:20.500
I’m not telling you to find love!
Have some fun.

16:20.583 --> 16:23.166
Tread that fine line
between love and lust.

16:23.250 --> 16:24.917
That’s what the readers love.

16:24.959 --> 16:29.375
What woman in her right mind would
agree to interview for a sex column?

16:29.458 --> 16:30.083
Why would you tell her?

16:30.166 --> 16:33.250
Are you crazy?
You have to if it’s an interview.

16:33.291 --> 16:37.542
Not if you write anonymously,
and not if you rewrite creatively.

16:39.375 --> 16:46.500
Just imagine you’re writing a novel.
This is just a story.

16:47.000 --> 16:50.291
You get pages to write, get paid,

16:50.375 --> 16:53.166
and monitor readers’ reactions.
That’s three birds.

16:54.792 --> 16:55.583
Come on.

16:56.375 --> 16:57.166
What...

16:57.250 --> 17:00.959
You’re a good writer,
but the book didn’t work out.

17:03.208 --> 17:07.875
Just don't quit that job hastily like I did.

17:08.208 --> 17:11.709
It’s a decent place,
if you get on with that chief editor.

17:11.792 --> 17:17.041
So you don’t want a relationship,
but you want sex.

17:17.125 --> 17:19.750
Dating apps are the answer then.

17:19.834 --> 17:23.917
It’s actually convenient.
What they want is clear and simple.

17:24.000 --> 17:26.625
What if I clearly and simply catch an STD?

17:26.709 --> 17:29.750
If you catch an STD,
I’m not sharing food with you again.

17:29.834 --> 17:32.125
I’m Ham Ja-young, the Legend!

17:32.208 --> 17:35.500
How could someone of my caliber
go swim in a kiddy pool?

17:36.709 --> 17:39.834
You have someone on your hit list?

17:40.375 --> 17:44.166
There’s a cute one at my gym.
I’m gonna get him very soon.

17:44.250 --> 17:48.166
Oh shit, Ja-young!
Namgung Sang-woo is getting married.

17:49.041 --> 17:52.500
What a perfect end to your day.

17:52.750 --> 17:54.917
He was the love of your life.

17:55.166 --> 17:58.083
They go away and get married,
all of them.

17:59.583 --> 18:00.375
Hey!

18:00.458 --> 18:01.375
What?

18:03.834 --> 18:05.583
What I meant was...

18:08.542 --> 18:12.291
Don’t be disheartened.
You can meet someone, you will.

18:12.375 --> 18:16.750
That cute hunk from the gym,
bring him over.

18:17.667 --> 18:21.208
If I get him here
in front of you by next week,

18:21.500 --> 18:23.125
what do I get?

18:23.208 --> 18:25.959
Why should you get anything
for bringing a guy here?

18:26.041 --> 18:26.583
Why?

18:26.667 --> 18:31.709
Because I need motivation!
Come on, place your bets.

18:32.834 --> 18:38.834
I sincerely root for your new beginning,

18:38.917 --> 18:42.583
but I’m gonna bet $100
on you failing this one.

18:43.917 --> 18:44.834
I bet 200.

18:47.959 --> 18:49.917
- Hello.
- Hi.

19:05.291 --> 19:06.542
Hey.

19:06.625 --> 19:07.709
Hey.

19:08.834 --> 19:11.291
Do you like beer?

19:11.709 --> 19:12.792
Sure.

19:13.792 --> 19:15.792
Do you want to have one later?

19:18.542 --> 19:19.208
I’d like that, yes.

19:19.291 --> 19:20.083
Okay.

19:23.875 --> 19:24.625
Mom!

19:26.208 --> 19:27.458
Here’s your protein, honey.

19:27.542 --> 19:31.291
I’m going for a beer with this lady.
You want to come?

19:31.375 --> 19:35.250
Just one though,
you don’t want a beer belly.

19:35.333 --> 19:36.500
Of course not.

19:36.583 --> 19:38.542
Be wise and choose low cal snacks.

19:38.625 --> 19:40.083
- Like dried fish fillet.
- Okay.

19:40.750 --> 19:44.458
- Dried fish is a perfect match for beer.
- Sure.

19:44.542 --> 19:47.750
- Be home by midnight.
- Okay, mom.

19:48.291 --> 19:51.625
Book clubs are the new hot spot for hookups.

19:51.709 --> 19:54.667
Hyewha Book Club is the hottest.

19:55.583 --> 19:59.750
Go for the first guy you make
eye contact with.

20:05.375 --> 20:11.625
Honestly, what you want are strong legs.
Climbers are always worth the climb.

20:11.709 --> 20:12.750
Ow...

20:13.500 --> 20:14.709
You okay?

20:19.750 --> 20:23.583
The true, meant-to-be one strikes you
like lightning.

20:23.667 --> 20:25.041
Wake up, this is the last stop.

20:25.625 --> 20:29.875
You have to catch that moment.

20:32.458 --> 20:36.834
“Wanna grab a coffee?”
A classic that never fails.

20:37.041 --> 20:38.875
Do you want to have coffee?

20:45.917 --> 20:50.166
But what if you feel your ancestors
aren’t looking out for you?

20:50.750 --> 20:52.208
You must honor them with a ritual.

21:03.417 --> 21:04.875
I’ll offer you as a sacrifice, fraud!

21:05.625 --> 21:06.709
Dammit.

21:09.667 --> 21:13.542
What happened to all the normal ones?

21:15.208 --> 21:19.834
I have $30,000 in student loans,
and $60,000 in key money loans

21:20.291 --> 21:21.667
totaling $93,682 in debt...

21:21.750 --> 21:24.333
That’s the third time you’ve said that.

21:24.625 --> 21:26.333
Can’t you have a proper relationship?

21:26.417 --> 21:33.583
How can I,
with debt totaling $96,380?

21:34.083 --> 21:36.500
Let’s say debtors can date.

21:36.583 --> 21:40.625
How many men are worth
spending my resources dating

21:40.709 --> 21:46.041
while paying off $96,380?

21:46.875 --> 21:51.333
Still, at 29, I need sex to live.

21:51.417 --> 21:55.959
America has the same problem.
You know what their biggest issue is?

21:56.041 --> 21:59.959
The accumulated sexual frustration
of the 20s and 30s.

22:00.166 --> 22:01.792
And what does that tell you?

22:02.458 --> 22:05.250
Being fluent in English
doesn’t solve the problem.

22:05.959 --> 22:08.041
There goes your choplogic again.

22:12.166 --> 22:15.458
Drink this and go home,
or you’ll suffer tomorrow.

22:17.959 --> 22:19.500
Why did you give me this?

22:19.583 --> 22:21.000
To sober you up.

22:21.792 --> 22:22.583
What...

22:23.208 --> 22:24.125
Why are you looking at me like that?

22:25.375 --> 22:30.500
What are you doing?
Pull it up! I mean it.

22:46.834 --> 22:48.417
It’s New Year’s Day.
Don’t come in to work.

22:48.500 --> 22:50.959
Shit, it’s New Year’s Day.

23:06.667 --> 23:15.041
Nooooo! Stop!

23:29.417 --> 23:33.291
Ja-young, find Mr. Right on LOVE BRIDGE
and make the new year richer ♥♥♥

23:35.417 --> 23:37.500
Delete app?

23:38.125 --> 23:43.417
One week turned into 1,000 days,
and you turned into stone.

23:43.750 --> 23:47.333
You owe me 100 bucks.

23:59.375 --> 24:01.917
ID: PrettyHuge

24:05.875 --> 24:08.208
Hey, babe! Where you at?

24:11.667 --> 24:12.959
Hi!

24:15.041 --> 24:17.500
Want me to come over?
I’m feeling pretty hot.

24:17.625 --> 24:18.875
What the hell?

24:20.375 --> 24:21.792
My eyes!

24:24.041 --> 24:25.542
BananaSkin
CandyThief

24:25.625 --> 24:27.208
TouchYouAllOver
WithMeTonight

24:27.291 --> 24:29.291
...TweetyBird likes your profile!

24:41.500 --> 24:43.125
Mak Ja-young, 29

24:44.583 --> 24:46.083
Sorry I’m late!

24:51.709 --> 24:54.500
It’s from mom. Take it.

24:55.333 --> 25:00.333
Mak Ja-young...
as in, “sleeps around”?

25:17.125 --> 25:17.750
Excuse me.

25:17.834 --> 25:18.667
Yeah?

25:19.375 --> 25:20.792
Are you Mak Ja-young?

25:21.208 --> 25:23.500
Yeah, that’s me.

25:23.750 --> 25:25.750
I'm... from LOVE BRIDGE.

25:26.834 --> 25:28.208
I’m Tweety Bird.

25:29.583 --> 25:30.500
Oh, hi!

25:30.709 --> 25:31.792
Hi.

25:34.458 --> 25:35.834
Did you give blood?

25:36.291 --> 25:41.625
I got here early and saw a blood van.

25:43.166 --> 25:44.041
Uh...

25:46.542 --> 25:48.375
Shall we take a walk? Maybe?

25:48.458 --> 25:51.542
Shall we? Sounds good.

25:56.041 --> 26:01.041
Are you trying to look like
Hyun Bin from that movie?

26:01.792 --> 26:03.458
That wasn’t my intention.

26:05.166 --> 26:07.792
Do you belong to a cult by any chance?

26:09.250 --> 26:10.500
No, do you?

26:10.917 --> 26:14.458
Of course not. I'm not crazy.

26:16.458 --> 26:18.625
Do you have a wife?

26:20.542 --> 26:21.959
What are you doing?

26:22.166 --> 26:26.250
It’s a simple question.
There’s no harm in checking.

26:27.083 --> 26:29.333
I don’t.
Otherwise, I wouldn’t be here.

26:31.208 --> 26:33.709
And you’re not expecting your mom

26:34.625 --> 26:37.542
or planning on telling her everything?

26:37.625 --> 26:40.417
No, my mom... we rarely talk.

26:40.500 --> 26:41.750
- Okay.
- Okay.

26:44.166 --> 26:46.417
For your information,

26:47.333 --> 26:49.291
my dad’s a homicide detective.

26:50.458 --> 26:51.834
Well, thank him for his service.

26:52.083 --> 26:54.417
I’m hungry after giving blood.
Let’s go eat something.

26:54.500 --> 26:55.458
Okay.

26:56.250 --> 26:59.041
Shall we make an introduction first?

26:59.834 --> 27:01.917
“Sleep Around” can’t be your real name.

27:03.125 --> 27:04.834
- Promise you won’t laugh.
- I promise.

27:04.917 --> 27:06.750
It’s Ham Ja-young [“Sleeps Once”].

27:12.792 --> 27:14.667
My name is Park Woori.

27:14.750 --> 27:16.417
- Park Woori?
- Yes.

27:17.166 --> 27:18.291
As in… “The act of fucking”?

27:21.875 --> 27:23.000
Oh my God...

27:27.709 --> 27:28.792
I’m sorry.

27:28.875 --> 27:30.083
Shall we go then?

27:30.959 --> 27:31.709
Okay.

27:43.959 --> 27:45.583
Do you give blood often?

27:46.041 --> 27:48.750
It’s nice to do something nice
for the new year.

27:50.458 --> 27:52.166
And the buckwheat noodles?

27:52.250 --> 27:54.959
It’s nice to eat something nice
for the new year.

27:55.041 --> 27:57.917
Is that your New Year’s Day ritual?

28:00.667 --> 28:02.250
Why aren’t you eating?

28:04.250 --> 28:08.458
The broth tastes like
someone washed a tea towel in it.

28:10.333 --> 28:11.875
Can we get a bottle of soju?

28:23.667 --> 28:26.166
You can’t let good food go to waste.

28:40.417 --> 28:41.291
Drink?

28:41.375 --> 28:42.375
No, I’m good.

28:42.458 --> 28:45.125
Don’t make me drink alone
on New Year’s Day.

29:05.750 --> 29:11.834
And let’s drop the formalities
between two peers with embarrassing names.

29:12.750 --> 29:15.208
You’re already doing it.

29:15.291 --> 29:16.625
I’ll be honest with you.

29:16.959 --> 29:22.792
This is my first time using the app,
and I thought a lot before coming here.

29:23.291 --> 29:28.792
I'm not trying to back out, but
I feel I need to know you better.

29:29.625 --> 29:34.500
For all you know, you could be
a total asshole looking for free sex.

29:34.750 --> 29:37.959
I guess you have to be cautious...
since you’re a girl.

29:38.083 --> 29:39.458
Because I’m a girl?

29:40.083 --> 29:43.792
What I’m saying is...

29:43.875 --> 29:46.083
There’s a bigger risk for women.

29:48.792 --> 29:54.166
Why did you choose me?
You must receive a lot of likes.

29:54.542 --> 30:00.083
Their show-off pictures
only make them look pathetic.

30:06.041 --> 30:08.583
You looked least likely to have an STD.

30:09.959 --> 30:11.625
Are you looking for a girlfriend?

30:11.709 --> 30:13.125
Not really, no.

30:13.208 --> 30:14.667
Then why are you here?

30:18.041 --> 30:20.375
I don't know... same reasons as you?

30:20.458 --> 30:21.500
Come on.

30:22.792 --> 30:24.583
Well, uh...

30:25.959 --> 30:28.041
I guess I got a little lazy?

30:28.625 --> 30:31.083
I suppose I’m lonely, but...

30:31.500 --> 30:35.917
then again, meeting someone new
and getting to know her,

30:36.500 --> 30:40.333
being a nice guy, exchanging pleasantries,
that’s all nice too, but...

30:41.542 --> 30:43.041
I'm going through a phase.

30:44.125 --> 30:46.834
I need to warm up, and...
I don’t know.

30:47.125 --> 30:48.709
I’m not sure.

30:50.125 --> 30:52.166
You’re not looking for a relationship?

30:52.250 --> 30:55.375
I would if circumstances allowed,
but now’s not the right time.

30:57.417 --> 30:59.625
Do you still think I’m some weird guy?

31:02.375 --> 31:03.291
Never mind.

31:03.542 --> 31:06.333
I’m not looking for anything serious.

31:06.959 --> 31:08.583
I shouldn’t be interviewing you.

31:09.875 --> 31:14.417
I don’t think I’m fit for a relationship.

31:17.000 --> 31:20.417
Even if Prince Charming comes along,
there’s no point if his dick is small.

31:26.417 --> 31:27.917
You’re really something else.

31:32.291 --> 31:33.875
Can I ask what you do?

31:34.625 --> 31:36.208
I work in a bakery.

31:37.750 --> 31:38.333
You?

31:38.417 --> 31:39.792
I work for a publishing company…

31:41.125 --> 31:44.250
that makes school books.

31:45.917 --> 31:46.917
Do you like books?

31:46.959 --> 31:47.959
- Books?
- Yeah.

31:48.041 --> 31:49.709
Last book I read was three years ago.

31:49.792 --> 31:50.917
Not even magazines?

31:50.959 --> 31:53.792
At 29, I can’t afford to
waste time on magazines.

31:54.959 --> 31:55.959
I see.

31:59.083 --> 32:01.333
Are you really going to sleep
with a man you just met?

32:01.417 --> 32:03.166
Is it over already?
Gone in 60 seconds?

32:03.500 --> 32:07.875
If I don’t hear from you by 10, I’ll call
my friend’s dad’s cousin who’s a narcotics cop.

32:08.125 --> 32:09.959
Where’s your hotel?
In Hongdae? Or Jangchung?

32:10.041 --> 32:11.291
Get your act together, girl!

32:11.375 --> 32:13.166
Okay, we’re waiting for an update.

32:13.709 --> 32:19.709
Remember, I’m expecting 3,000 words
by midnight tomorrow.

32:20.166 --> 32:21.500
I’m counting on you.

32:22.500 --> 32:25.542
Is she hot?
Think you can write something?

32:27.750 --> 32:28.667
You picked up the bill.

32:29.333 --> 32:30.375
Yes.

32:31.083 --> 32:37.333
Two noodles, $24, two soju, $8...
comes to $16 each.

32:37.417 --> 32:39.250
I’m not a math person, babe.

32:39.333 --> 32:42.208
Don’t babe me just yet.

32:59.750 --> 33:04.625
If you’re planning to take my kidney
or something, I’ll kill you.

33:04.709 --> 33:09.458
How come there’s only six floors?

33:09.709 --> 33:10.709
What?

33:25.500 --> 33:26.542
Oh...

33:37.834 --> 33:39.917
The room was pretty nice.

33:40.667 --> 33:43.709
Yeah, the interior design was okay.

33:44.959 --> 33:47.750
It’s quiet,
perhaps because it’s New Year’s.

33:47.834 --> 33:50.041
I guess they’re all visiting relatives.

33:50.291 --> 33:51.291
I guess.

33:53.375 --> 33:54.959
We can eat something
if you’re hungry.

33:56.542 --> 33:57.959
It was fun.

33:58.667 --> 33:59.500
Yeah?

33:59.709 --> 34:00.709
Get home safe.

34:00.792 --> 34:01.625
You too.

34:05.417 --> 34:06.792
- Hey...
- Yeah?

34:07.208 --> 34:08.250
So, uh...

34:09.959 --> 34:12.291
How many likes do you get?

34:12.583 --> 34:13.208
What?

34:13.291 --> 34:15.667
I was curious.

34:15.750 --> 34:21.125
Men rarely get any.
Wondered if it’s different for women.

34:21.458 --> 34:22.917
You suddenly got curious?

34:23.709 --> 34:24.959
I guess.

34:26.750 --> 34:29.166
Are you afraid I’ll meet someone else?

34:29.250 --> 34:31.166
It’s not that.

34:32.583 --> 34:34.125
I’m grateful you chose me.

34:34.792 --> 34:35.959
So random.

34:36.834 --> 34:37.709
Yes.

34:38.917 --> 34:40.083
I’m gonna go.

34:40.792 --> 34:41.792
Okay, bye.

34:45.583 --> 34:46.667
And hey!

34:46.917 --> 34:48.709
Should we...

34:50.875 --> 34:52.875
Should we...

34:53.834 --> 34:55.750
Shall I call you? Maybe?

34:55.959 --> 34:56.875
I’ll call you.

35:22.166 --> 35:27.417
Good old-fashioned
one night stand for a holiday

35:36.250 --> 35:39.709
It’s a grey area:
Holiday, and a one-nighter, too.

35:42.041 --> 35:46.875
29 and 33 are both unlucky numbers.

35:47.542 --> 35:50.959
Then again, four years makes an ideal gap,

35:52.083 --> 35:56.792
and yet, you’ve already tried out
the sexual match. How was it?

35:57.083 --> 35:58.291
You’re excited, aren’t you?

35:58.375 --> 36:00.792
Just one night only? That’s it?

36:00.875 --> 36:05.834
I don't know. Why did he
ask me at the end? Yikes.

36:05.917 --> 36:08.875
You met for sex. Why do you care?

36:08.959 --> 36:11.458
I don’t know. It bothers me.

36:14.083 --> 36:17.000
Whoa, you’re waiting for his call.

36:17.083 --> 36:19.792
Who? Me?

36:19.875 --> 36:20.458
No.

36:20.542 --> 36:21.792
I can see through your lies.
I’m a lawyer.

36:21.875 --> 36:22.709
No!

36:22.792 --> 36:23.375
Really?

36:23.458 --> 36:24.417
Hell no.

36:25.667 --> 36:28.959
I’m telling you, not another word.

36:29.083 --> 36:33.333
Don’t get grumpy with me.
Just call him.

36:33.417 --> 36:35.834
It’s over. A done deal.

36:35.917 --> 36:40.458
If I didn't know you better...
it’s written all over your face.

36:40.792 --> 36:43.083
The chemistry was fucking awesome.

36:43.166 --> 36:44.667
- Huh?
- Grandma!

36:44.917 --> 36:45.792
What chemistry?

36:45.875 --> 36:48.250
You okay, grandma?

36:48.458 --> 36:50.542
- I was worried about you.
- You okay?

36:51.375 --> 36:52.333
How are you feeling?

36:52.417 --> 36:53.959
I’m fine.

36:55.667 --> 36:57.917
- Anyway...
- You scared me.

36:58.500 --> 36:59.917
What chemistry were you talking about?

37:00.000 --> 37:00.917
Sorry?

37:01.917 --> 37:04.750
We have such good chemistry.

37:05.959 --> 37:10.417
Sun-bin, you have to find a new job.

37:10.500 --> 37:14.792
You shouldn’t be meddling with
people getting divorces.

37:14.875 --> 37:20.625
But I love what I do!
I’ll divorce all the couples in the world.

37:22.750 --> 37:27.959
There’s no one in your firm
you can set up with Ja-young?

37:28.041 --> 37:31.834
But grandma, she has a FWB now.

37:32.583 --> 37:35.083
What’s an FWB?

37:35.166 --> 37:36.250
- A FWB is short for—
- Friend with Beer.

37:36.375 --> 37:39.041
- What?
- A friend you have beer with.

37:41.709 --> 37:45.208
Well then, the more the better.

37:45.500 --> 37:48.250
No, grandma. That’s a bad idea.

37:48.750 --> 37:53.083
I have good news.
I finally got a grant for my podcast.

37:53.458 --> 37:55.875
I have money to do it properly now.

37:56.542 --> 38:00.542
Round up all the good talkers
from your circle.

38:00.750 --> 38:04.625
Who listens to that anyway?

38:04.709 --> 38:05.959
A lot of people.

38:06.083 --> 38:08.834
Nowadays, it’s more popular than radio.

38:09.083 --> 38:11.208
What should we talk about?

38:11.291 --> 38:14.792
The first episode is,
“The Protagonist of My Life.”

38:15.291 --> 38:16.542
Protagonist?

38:17.375 --> 38:20.291
Grannies live their whole life
for others,

38:20.375 --> 38:23.834
looking after the kids,
husbands, and their parents.

38:23.917 --> 38:27.208
I want them to talk about
how they’re protagonists...

38:30.458 --> 38:33.500
Who gives a shit about
being a protagonist?

38:33.709 --> 38:34.208
Huh?

38:34.291 --> 38:38.792
Nobody is the protagonist
of their lives.

38:38.875 --> 38:40.208
Are you, Ja-young?

38:40.291 --> 38:42.625
If I’m not the protagonist
of my life, what am I?

38:42.709 --> 38:44.083
A supporting side character.

38:44.166 --> 38:44.834
What?

38:48.667 --> 38:55.875
29... that’s a good age.

38:58.500 --> 39:00.542
I’ll get some rest.

39:03.250 --> 39:05.375
Have a good nap, grandma.

39:08.083 --> 39:11.500
What the hell is
a supporting side character?

39:50.250 --> 39:53.083
Please see attached Ep 1.
See you tomorrow.

40:10.083 --> 40:14.083
Mak Ja-young:
OMW, see you soon!

40:16.417 --> 40:19.000
Are you in bed?

40:21.834 --> 40:24.417
What are you...

40:25.375 --> 40:26.750
Are you awake...

40:37.667 --> 40:38.709
Yeon-hee!

40:42.375 --> 40:43.542
What brings you here?

40:47.542 --> 40:49.125
Is something wrong?

40:50.208 --> 40:51.709
What is it?

41:04.834 --> 41:06.166
Are you okay?

41:20.125 --> 41:21.875
Thank you for last night.

41:26.208 --> 41:28.375
Why don’t you go down
and come back up again?

41:34.041 --> 41:35.166
Park Woori!

41:36.417 --> 41:37.750
In my office, now.

41:45.250 --> 41:47.458
What happened to you
on New Year’s Day?

41:47.500 --> 41:48.333
Sorry?

41:49.041 --> 41:49.667
The column.

41:49.750 --> 41:51.500
Yeah... um...

41:52.875 --> 41:57.125
I’m not right for the sex column.

41:57.208 --> 41:59.500
I was wrong about you.

41:59.917 --> 42:02.250
How can a sex column
not have sex in it?

42:02.834 --> 42:04.750
You’re a true writer.

42:05.041 --> 42:08.417
At first, I thought you were protesting,

42:08.500 --> 42:13.333
but then, once it was uploaded,
the readers’ reactions!

42:13.875 --> 42:16.667
That tantalizing point.

42:16.959 --> 42:22.000
It’s not about sex
and crazy foreplay.

42:22.750 --> 42:24.166
It’s about the emotion.

42:24.458 --> 42:28.834
A man and a woman
in questionable circumstances,

42:29.709 --> 42:33.834
prying like cats while
wanting to attack like snakes.

42:34.208 --> 42:36.333
All that tension builds up,
and they go to a motel.

42:36.417 --> 42:40.041
But the following sentence is
they came out of the motel?

42:40.250 --> 42:42.917
Absolutely playing push and pull
with the readers.

42:43.500 --> 42:45.458
You’re a genius!

42:49.458 --> 42:50.375
Well, I...

42:51.834 --> 42:55.375
Did you write from imagination?
A story you heard from a friend?

42:56.208 --> 42:58.333
Or did you conduct an interview?

42:59.417 --> 43:01.041
Your own experience?

43:04.625 --> 43:06.333
You told me to be hands on.

43:09.083 --> 43:10.417
Let’s go for a 5-part series.

43:10.500 --> 43:11.166
A 5-part series?

43:11.250 --> 43:15.083
Tantalizing is the sexiest.

43:15.792 --> 43:19.125
In my 30-year career in the business,
I’ve never seen this concept at work.

43:19.208 --> 43:22.542
Expense the drinks and motel bills.

43:22.834 --> 43:23.875
No, I—

43:24.166 --> 43:28.625
This girl has a mouth on her.
Dig deeper.

43:29.959 --> 43:30.500
No, I don't think it’s—

43:30.583 --> 43:32.125
I’ll keep your secret.

43:32.208 --> 43:35.417
You can say it was research,
which is not a lie.

43:35.709 --> 43:36.208
But chief—

43:36.291 --> 43:40.208
I’ll cover your ass,
so just do as you’re told.

43:41.208 --> 43:42.208
Off you go.

43:46.083 --> 43:47.542
It’s gorgeous.

43:48.166 --> 43:51.041
The note says, “Forgive me.”

43:51.542 --> 43:53.250
He’s a romantic.

43:53.500 --> 43:55.625
It looks very expensive.

43:58.625 --> 44:00.000
Dad, I’ll be off then.

44:00.083 --> 44:02.291
I almost forgot.

44:04.917 --> 44:05.625
What is that?

44:05.750 --> 44:07.125
It’s for you.

44:07.333 --> 44:08.959
Why do you keep this mail?

44:09.166 --> 44:11.250
I told you to throw away
anything from the station.

44:11.834 --> 44:13.875
How can I? It’s your mail.

44:13.959 --> 44:17.583
I don’t work there anymore.
It’s junk mail.

44:18.542 --> 44:25.375
You worked so hard for the job.
Don’t you have regrets?

44:25.458 --> 44:27.875
Dad, I found my way.

44:27.959 --> 44:31.000
Start-ups are thorny paths.
You don’t want to go down there.

44:31.083 --> 44:33.875
What if it’s what I really want?

44:34.250 --> 44:35.000
What?

44:35.083 --> 44:37.041
It’s my life. This isn’t about you.

44:37.125 --> 44:40.625
You’re just upset because
you can’t boast about me anymore.

44:45.959 --> 44:47.583
Fine.

44:53.750 --> 44:58.166
You should live your life, too.

45:12.667 --> 45:13.709
Hello.

45:13.792 --> 45:17.041
Do you stop fighting with your dad
when you turn 30?

45:17.333 --> 45:19.583
I heard you got dumped
by your one night stand?

45:20.125 --> 45:24.000
Who dumped who?
I blocked his number first.

45:25.125 --> 45:29.333
We’re hanging out with
my boyfriend’s friends. Come quick.

45:30.166 --> 45:32.083
His friends from sports college?

45:32.291 --> 45:37.083
They are all so hot.
There’s even a Park Bo Gum lookalike.

45:37.667 --> 45:39.750
Is that right?

45:40.458 --> 45:42.291
- Yumi...
- Yeah.

45:44.166 --> 45:45.083
Just get your ass over here.

45:45.166 --> 45:46.375
I'm on my way.

46:05.083 --> 46:06.041
What’s the matter?

46:07.542 --> 46:08.375
Drink.

46:17.834 --> 46:20.375
- Are you grateful for me, too?
- What?

46:20.917 --> 46:21.959
It’s nothing.

46:27.667 --> 46:31.667
She is totally using you.
She has no feelings for you.

46:32.583 --> 46:35.542
She’s looking for comfort,
a quick fix.

46:38.875 --> 46:41.959
Why are women like that?
What’s wrong with them?

46:42.041 --> 46:44.083
We’re all like that,
not a single exception.

46:47.792 --> 46:48.625
Bitch...

46:48.709 --> 46:50.709
Tell me what’s wrong with men.

46:50.792 --> 46:53.542
You know she’s trouble,
but you just forget that if she’s pretty?

46:54.125 --> 46:56.083
Like some character
from a Marvel movie?

46:56.166 --> 46:59.250
You think you know me?
You got me figured out?

46:59.333 --> 47:02.041
You don’t have the guts
to confront her boyfriend either.

47:02.542 --> 47:05.709
You can’t win love
nor can you refuse it for dignity.

47:05.792 --> 47:06.834
- Hey!
- What?

47:06.917 --> 47:08.208
Do you know how to console people?

47:08.291 --> 47:10.709
It’s hardly worth it.

47:10.792 --> 47:13.333
What comfort should I offer
to a loser who steals from others?

47:13.417 --> 47:15.667
I can’t talk to a girl.

47:15.750 --> 47:17.417
Be reasonable.

47:17.834 --> 47:21.000
Would you be attracted to you
if you were a girl?

47:21.959 --> 47:22.500
Very much so,

47:22.583 --> 47:23.208
moderately so,

47:23.291 --> 47:23.542
somewhat,

47:23.625 --> 47:23.959
very little, or

47:24.041 --> 47:24.834
not at all.

47:27.083 --> 47:29.625
Very much so, moderately so...

47:30.208 --> 47:30.792
Somewhat.

47:30.834 --> 47:31.667
Somewhat?

47:31.750 --> 47:34.375
With men, you have to
move down two scales.

47:34.458 --> 47:35.250
So it’s “not at all.”

47:35.333 --> 47:35.834
How come?

47:35.875 --> 47:38.875
Wait... what about women?

47:38.959 --> 47:41.750
As for me, I’m “moderately so,”

47:41.834 --> 47:45.959
but so many women belong to that category,
I have no competitive edge.

47:46.417 --> 47:47.458
That’s sad, too.

47:49.542 --> 47:52.625
You don’t want to
go below your league,

47:52.709 --> 47:55.709
but your body craves
something hot.

47:55.792 --> 47:59.792
It’s a vicious cycle
in a huge grey area.

48:06.083 --> 48:06.959
Hey.

48:07.041 --> 48:08.041
Yeah?

48:09.208 --> 48:10.166
Am I bad in bed?

48:14.291 --> 48:15.959
How should I put it?

48:18.792 --> 48:19.834
You’re like a private.

48:20.291 --> 48:21.834
No, someone who is enlisting,

48:21.917 --> 48:24.333
walking into a barber shop
to get his hair clipped.

48:24.417 --> 48:26.125
I'm serious.

48:28.792 --> 48:30.542
Well... it was alright for me.

48:33.125 --> 48:34.083
Yeah?

48:39.750 --> 48:40.917
My dick is big, right?

48:41.208 --> 48:42.500
Very much so, moderately so,
not really, not at all.

48:42.583 --> 48:45.917
Knock it off with the questionnaire.
Tell me the truth.

48:47.208 --> 48:47.917
It’s cute.

48:48.000 --> 48:50.750
So cute it made you scream?

48:51.250 --> 48:53.834
Do you think women moan for men?

48:54.166 --> 48:56.709
No, it’s to arouse herself.

48:59.417 --> 49:00.500
It’s true.

49:01.625 --> 49:05.500
So transparent and honest.
Your parents raised you well!

49:08.750 --> 49:11.792
My mom died
a week after she gave birth.

49:12.834 --> 49:13.417
What?

49:13.500 --> 49:17.583
- She’d just turned 30.
- Oh...

49:17.792 --> 49:20.291
I’ll be 30 next year.

49:20.375 --> 49:23.375
That’s too young to die.

49:24.792 --> 49:28.583
I live my life thinking
I’m living her life for her.

49:28.667 --> 49:31.875
Maybe I’ll live differently from 30,

49:32.667 --> 49:35.875
as the protagonist of my life.

49:41.250 --> 49:42.208
That’s admirable.

49:55.208 --> 49:56.583
Latest kick-yourself moment?

49:56.667 --> 50:00.000
I hit on my guy friend and
got outright rejected.

50:01.500 --> 50:02.417
What’s your biggest scare?

50:02.500 --> 50:04.000
Bank balance.

50:04.375 --> 50:05.208
You?

50:06.000 --> 50:06.417
Needle.

50:06.500 --> 50:07.000
A needle?

50:07.083 --> 50:07.583
A syringe.

50:07.667 --> 50:08.208
Tattoo.

50:08.583 --> 50:10.208
Dream sex spot?

50:10.291 --> 50:11.000
Ferris wheel.

50:11.125 --> 50:11.917
Seriously?

50:12.500 --> 50:14.208
What if you swing too much and fall off?

50:16.959 --> 50:17.709
That’s the point.

50:17.792 --> 50:18.417
What about you?

50:18.500 --> 50:19.500
Radio studio.

50:19.583 --> 50:20.250
What?

50:20.333 --> 50:21.417
I’ve done that though.

50:21.500 --> 50:22.667
How?

50:22.750 --> 50:24.583
I worked for a radio station briefly.

50:24.625 --> 50:25.417
I see.

50:26.125 --> 50:29.834
You can count on soundproofing.

50:30.333 --> 50:31.291
Hey.

50:32.542 --> 50:33.709
How am I?

50:37.417 --> 50:37.917
How are you what?

50:37.959 --> 50:38.959
Am I good?

50:39.041 --> 50:41.041
Well, you are...

50:41.166 --> 50:42.000
Stop.

50:47.291 --> 50:48.208
You’re erotic.

50:53.792 --> 50:56.125
The worst scumbag you ever dated?

50:56.208 --> 50:57.125
My first love.

50:57.208 --> 50:57.709
Why?

50:57.792 --> 51:03.667
It wasn’t the first time or
the first relationship,

51:03.750 --> 51:08.875
but you just know intuitively,
“This guy is my first love.”

51:09.667 --> 51:10.583
Then what happened?

51:12.375 --> 51:13.917
We went out.

51:14.166 --> 51:15.750
Doesn’t it make it a successful first love?

51:16.041 --> 51:19.750
I got a job at the radio station
for him, and we dated for two years.

51:19.834 --> 51:21.959
Then he wanted to break up.

51:22.750 --> 51:27.000
I was so devastated,
I begged him to let me be around.

51:27.083 --> 51:31.750
So we just had sex for three more years.

51:32.667 --> 51:36.250
The funny thing is,
I didn’t see anyone else in that three years.

51:36.834 --> 51:39.083
But he was seeing other people

51:39.166 --> 51:41.166
while he was fucking me.

51:41.583 --> 51:42.792
What a scumbag!

51:42.875 --> 51:44.333
It gets even better.

51:44.959 --> 51:50.500
He told me one day that
he found someone he really cares about,

51:51.375 --> 51:53.166
and he wanted to end it with me.

51:54.041 --> 51:57.250
It hurt a lot more than when
he wanted to break up with me.

51:59.291 --> 52:04.166
I acted up a bit and
bad rumors spread at work.

52:04.834 --> 52:06.125
So I quit.

52:10.125 --> 52:12.208
He’s getting married this month.

52:24.542 --> 52:27.417
I asked him the last time we slept together

52:27.834 --> 52:29.709
who is better.

52:29.959 --> 52:34.125
He has better sex with me,
but he wants to marry her.

52:35.166 --> 52:36.917
He loves her more.

52:40.583 --> 52:43.875
What sad load of crap is that?

52:44.417 --> 52:47.875
If anything deserves total havoc,
it’s that wedding.

52:47.959 --> 52:50.542
Shall I do it?

52:50.917 --> 52:57.166
Show up at the wedding, expose
all his evil, and break up the marriage?

52:57.250 --> 53:02.542
Totally! Pack up.
I'll go with you.

53:21.250 --> 53:25.709
Knock knock, I’m here to see

53:26.625 --> 53:28.917
how my doormat is doing?

53:29.875 --> 53:34.792
Thank you for asking
weird questions for me.

53:35.333 --> 53:38.125
All I wanted to do was just talk,

53:38.917 --> 53:42.166
but I couldn’t be completely honest
even with my best friends.

53:43.750 --> 53:49.917
Don’t we want love
so we can talk and have sex?

53:50.583 --> 53:53.041
Why is that so difficult?

53:53.583 --> 53:58.709
Let’s stop pretending to be cool.
We’re all fucking lonely.

53:59.792 --> 54:01.333
Who here isn’t?

54:07.333 --> 54:08.250
Hey.

54:09.750 --> 54:11.875
Where did you come from?

54:13.166 --> 54:14.959
Why did you come to me?

54:18.083 --> 54:19.250
Tell me.

55:47.417 --> 55:49.500
Hey, wake up.

55:52.041 --> 55:53.834
How much did we drink last night?

55:54.667 --> 55:56.208
Where am I...?

55:56.291 --> 55:59.083
In a motel room.

56:00.959 --> 56:05.291
Did you... do it to me
while I was passed out?

56:05.500 --> 56:06.375
What the hell?

56:06.500 --> 56:10.375
You stripped off, complaining it’s hot.
I made sure you didn’t catch cold.

56:11.834 --> 56:13.041
Right?

56:13.667 --> 56:15.166
I paid for the room, too.

56:15.542 --> 56:17.792
Thank you very much.
Send me your account number.

56:17.875 --> 56:20.041
I already have. Send half.

56:22.166 --> 56:23.250
Well, thanks.

56:25.083 --> 56:26.041
What was that?

56:26.125 --> 56:26.834
What?

56:28.125 --> 56:30.375
You’re sorry to spend money
without having sex?

56:31.792 --> 56:33.166
Want me to blow you now?

56:33.959 --> 56:36.875
Are you crazy?
I’m a sensible, educated man.

56:37.291 --> 56:39.583
What’s wrong with you?

56:40.542 --> 56:42.208
Do you have no shame?

56:42.959 --> 56:43.792
Urgh.

56:44.208 --> 56:45.625
I have no shame. So what?

56:45.709 --> 56:46.834
Good for you.

57:06.417 --> 57:07.583
Relationships are a fart,

57:07.667 --> 57:08.667
and marriages are poop.

57:08.709 --> 57:10.291
You keep on farting,

57:10.375 --> 57:11.792
and when you have to poop,
you get married.

57:13.667 --> 57:18.250
I’m getting even more curious,
what’s going on in her head?

57:21.834 --> 57:22.542
I love it.

57:24.834 --> 57:25.625
It’s on me!

57:25.709 --> 57:26.542
Can you do it twice in a day?

57:26.625 --> 57:27.125
What?

57:40.750 --> 57:41.542
Hey?

57:42.458 --> 57:44.208
Do you know why thirty is thirty?

57:44.458 --> 57:45.000
Why?

57:45.208 --> 57:47.250
Because you’re allowed to be dirty.

57:54.583 --> 57:58.041
She’s the first girl to
make a sex joke with age.

58:04.583 --> 58:06.041
We did it three times.

58:07.291 --> 58:08.583
Can you do it one more time?

58:08.667 --> 58:15.041
She awakened potentials in me
I wasn’t even aware of.

58:15.250 --> 58:16.500
This column is really funny.

58:16.583 --> 58:17.583
Apparently, it’s a true story.

58:17.667 --> 58:18.667
Can you see it?

58:19.583 --> 58:21.667
She made me go back to being a child.

58:25.125 --> 58:27.834
Is it true that women can’t have sex
unless they’re emotionally involved?

58:28.333 --> 58:30.834
I totally can.

58:31.291 --> 58:34.250
She kept me excited, even
when we weren’t with each other,

58:34.709 --> 58:38.417
and unleashed the laughter
that had been locked inside me.

58:50.166 --> 58:53.458
I really felt it this time.

58:55.667 --> 58:58.750
If this isn’t a relationship,
then what is?

58:58.834 --> 59:00.333
It’s more like theater.

59:00.417 --> 59:03.875
Maybe her acting won’t end.

59:03.959 --> 59:10.500
But if it’s really just a show,
I keep on thinking I want to end it.

59:11.417 --> 59:12.500
When’s the next episode coming?

59:23.750 --> 59:31.291
Maybe that’s why

59:45.000 --> 59:48.375
the words slipped out of my mouth...
I love you.

1:00:01.458 --> 1:00:05.709
Woori’s column hit 500,000 views!

1:00:06.041 --> 1:00:07.750
Everyone, get off the keyboards.

1:00:08.875 --> 1:00:10.834
Dinner is on me!

1:00:11.458 --> 1:00:12.959
Pack up, we’re having beef.

1:00:13.083 --> 1:00:16.125
Let’s go! 500,000 views!

1:00:16.208 --> 1:00:19.250
To Park Woori, the genius!

1:00:19.333 --> 1:00:21.375
To Woori!

1:00:21.458 --> 1:00:22.875
Thank you so much.

1:00:23.333 --> 1:00:24.417
Have some.

1:00:24.500 --> 1:00:25.083
I’ll eat myself.

1:00:25.166 --> 1:00:27.291
It’s okay. Open your mouth.

1:00:27.375 --> 1:00:30.125
Don’t favor him too much though.

1:00:30.333 --> 1:00:33.834
If you want my love,
then bring me a killer column.

1:00:33.917 --> 1:00:36.875
500,000 views is like a dream.

1:00:36.959 --> 1:00:38.291
- Wow, look at this!
- What is it?

1:00:38.375 --> 1:00:40.667
517,000 and counting.

1:00:40.750 --> 1:00:41.917
It’s incredible.

1:00:42.250 --> 1:00:44.750
LOVE BRIDGE subscribers have surged, too.

1:00:44.834 --> 1:00:47.375
People must’ve been horny
around New Year’s.

1:00:47.458 --> 1:00:49.333
Are you sure the story is
based on an interview?

1:00:49.792 --> 1:00:50.500
Yeah.

1:00:50.583 --> 1:00:53.166
Stealing leftovers from the next table,

1:00:53.250 --> 1:00:56.083
and with men, you should
move down by two scales...

1:00:56.166 --> 1:00:59.417
these details feel so real.

1:00:59.500 --> 1:01:02.500
And the writing feels somewhat
different from your usual style.

1:01:02.583 --> 1:01:05.458
Readers are raising suspicion, too.
About the details.

1:01:05.542 --> 1:01:09.333
What if it’s his story?
It’s pretty common around here.

1:01:10.625 --> 1:01:12.625
This is all a compliment, you know?

1:01:12.709 --> 1:01:15.750
Focus on what matters.
You made the readers horny.

1:01:15.834 --> 1:01:19.458
Who knew a sex column with
no sex would do so well?

1:01:19.542 --> 1:01:22.083
No wonder you’re a creative writing major.

1:01:22.375 --> 1:01:25.458
Good for you.
You got yourself a fan club.

1:01:25.792 --> 1:01:27.375
- Woori?
- Yes.

1:01:27.458 --> 1:01:29.750
- Let’s make it a 10-part series.
- No, that’s...

1:01:30.750 --> 1:01:32.709
It’s a direct order from
the managing director.

1:01:32.792 --> 1:01:34.834
Then you have to do it.

1:01:34.917 --> 1:01:36.625
- Absolutely.
- No objections.

1:01:36.709 --> 1:01:38.250
Well, please, you have to hear...

1:01:38.333 --> 1:01:41.917
And announcement!
Our team is getting a special bonus.

1:01:41.959 --> 1:01:43.625
Bonus, bonus, bonus!

1:01:44.417 --> 1:01:47.333
- Bonus!
- Bonus!

1:01:50.583 --> 1:01:53.583
My ace writer!

1:01:55.709 --> 1:01:57.083
Did you drink a lot?

1:01:59.959 --> 1:02:03.959
I got curious reading the story.

1:02:04.041 --> 1:02:05.500
Are you going out with her?

1:02:06.458 --> 1:02:07.375
No.

1:02:08.166 --> 1:02:10.542
Yeah, it’s no fun
if it happens too soon.

1:02:10.834 --> 1:02:13.083
You heated up
the readers so much.

1:02:13.417 --> 1:02:18.583
It’s the moment before the
relationship that’s the best.

1:02:21.875 --> 1:02:22.875
Woori.

1:02:24.375 --> 1:02:25.208
You should do it now.

1:02:25.583 --> 1:02:26.208
What?

1:02:26.291 --> 1:02:27.417
Write about the sex.

1:02:28.375 --> 1:02:33.125
You read the comments?
People are getting annoyed.

1:02:33.208 --> 1:02:36.333
There’s a limit to
tormenting the audience.

1:02:36.583 --> 1:02:39.625
Look at 50 Shades of Grey.

1:02:39.709 --> 1:02:41.542
It tantalizes you in the beginning,

1:02:41.625 --> 1:02:45.542
but when they show you,
they really show you.

1:02:45.917 --> 1:02:50.125
It’s time.
You have to write the real sex column.

1:02:50.208 --> 1:02:51.250
Chief...

1:02:51.375 --> 1:02:53.041
I’m going to stop.

1:02:53.125 --> 1:02:53.959
What?

1:02:55.333 --> 1:02:57.083
I can’t do it anymore.

1:02:59.500 --> 1:03:00.166
Are you...

1:03:00.250 --> 1:03:02.709
If I tell her sincerely,
she’ll understand.

1:03:04.792 --> 1:03:06.458
Are you in love with her?

1:03:07.917 --> 1:03:08.917
Is that it?

1:03:11.041 --> 1:03:14.250
You must be. Otherwise,
why would you tell her?

1:03:14.750 --> 1:03:19.583
Okay then, write creatively from now on.
That’s what you do, right?

1:03:20.208 --> 1:03:23.875
You’ve laid out the foundation.
From here to episode 10 will be

1:03:23.959 --> 1:03:28.291
an outright dirty novel,
or get help from Macho.

1:03:28.375 --> 1:03:31.583
No, I’m calling it quits.

1:03:32.458 --> 1:03:35.166
Don’t you know what a direct order means?

1:03:35.625 --> 1:03:39.750
Complete the 10-part,
and you’ll get your own page.

1:03:39.959 --> 1:03:41.250
You said you want to write a book.

1:03:42.875 --> 1:03:44.583
Think about it over the weekend.

1:03:45.166 --> 1:03:49.208
If she finds out about the column,

1:03:50.041 --> 1:03:55.417
or if you stop like this,
I won’t tolerate it.

1:04:02.750 --> 1:04:03.834
Where have you been?

1:04:04.166 --> 1:04:05.583
Let’s have a drink.

1:04:22.291 --> 1:04:25.458
It’ll be nice to have one now.

1:04:26.375 --> 1:04:32.333
One, two, three, four...
I’ll learn English.

1:04:46.792 --> 1:04:49.583
Ja-young... I love you.

1:05:10.333 --> 1:05:11.959
Tweety Bird

1:05:16.875 --> 1:05:17.875
Hello?

1:05:20.333 --> 1:05:21.417
Yeah...

1:05:22.667 --> 1:05:23.500
Now?

1:05:39.083 --> 1:05:40.667
What brings you here?

1:05:43.959 --> 1:05:45.458
I have something to tell you.

1:05:47.125 --> 1:05:49.959
Is there a café where we can talk?

1:05:50.083 --> 1:05:51.125
Let’s see...

1:06:02.625 --> 1:06:05.500
Shit! Your ex’s wedding is in an hour.

1:06:05.792 --> 1:06:10.583
Isn’t this the hotel he used to bring you to
all the time? What a bastard!

1:06:14.917 --> 1:06:16.208
What’s the matter? What is it?

1:06:19.750 --> 1:06:22.375
Remember, you made the offer first.

1:07:03.041 --> 1:07:07.583
What am I doing here?
I feel so stupid.

1:07:08.208 --> 1:07:09.417
Let’s get out of here.

1:07:10.792 --> 1:07:12.375
But we came all the way here.

1:07:13.125 --> 1:07:16.208
This is a terrible idea. Let’s go.

1:07:16.792 --> 1:07:19.166
Wait, what are you saying?

1:07:19.917 --> 1:07:23.083
Didn’t he dump you then
use you for three more years?

1:07:24.125 --> 1:07:24.875
Am I wrong?

1:07:25.125 --> 1:07:26.500
You know nothing.

1:07:27.000 --> 1:07:28.625
Then why do you cry
when you’re drunk?

1:07:29.000 --> 1:07:29.667
What?

1:07:29.917 --> 1:07:31.542
What did we come here for?

1:07:33.542 --> 1:07:37.417
Let’s at least watch the ceremony.

1:08:21.583 --> 1:08:23.125
Where do I give the wedding gift money?

1:08:23.208 --> 1:08:24.792
I’ll get the guestbook.

1:08:32.667 --> 1:08:33.458
Don’t look back.

1:08:33.542 --> 1:08:33.959
Huh?

1:08:34.083 --> 1:08:35.083
Keep walking.

1:08:35.166 --> 1:08:37.083
- Excuse me. Hey!
- Run!

1:08:37.458 --> 1:08:38.875
You there! Stop!

1:08:42.917 --> 1:08:45.041
Let go of this.

1:08:45.875 --> 1:08:47.834
No. Run.

1:08:54.417 --> 1:08:56.041
I can’t anymore.

1:09:03.583 --> 1:09:04.667
What did you do?

1:09:06.375 --> 1:09:10.625
Did you steal the gift money?
That’s theft.

1:09:14.834 --> 1:09:15.834
What is this?

1:09:16.041 --> 1:09:21.542
This... is not money...
but still quite important.

1:09:21.625 --> 1:09:23.208
I thought he’d be in trouble without this.

1:09:23.500 --> 1:09:27.208
I heard some celeb talk on a TV show.

1:09:27.291 --> 1:09:31.667
She said after she broke up with her lover,

1:09:31.750 --> 1:09:34.709
she wanted her ex to feel
a little anxious all the time.

1:09:35.083 --> 1:09:38.375
Not knowing who paid how much
at his wedding

1:09:38.458 --> 1:09:40.959
will kill him for the rest of his life.

1:09:42.917 --> 1:09:44.166
You’re a total nut.

1:09:54.417 --> 1:09:56.083
Do you feel better?

1:09:58.750 --> 1:10:00.166
Well…

1:10:04.625 --> 1:10:07.750
I thought I was the protagonist
of that man’s life.

1:10:09.291 --> 1:10:10.917
But I wasn’t.

1:10:11.959 --> 1:10:14.834
It just got confirmed
that I was a side character.

1:10:15.750 --> 1:10:20.041
But it doesn’t feel that shitty.

1:10:20.959 --> 1:10:25.834
I feel like I’m a cool sort of
side character.

1:10:26.750 --> 1:10:27.792
Cool, my ass.

1:10:28.333 --> 1:10:29.792
I guess I tried to run.

1:10:32.333 --> 1:10:33.834
Because I didn't want to admit it.

1:10:35.208 --> 1:10:37.417
But it was a good thing
I watched the wedding.

1:10:38.542 --> 1:10:40.083
So thank you!

1:10:43.458 --> 1:10:45.083
What’s that Park Bo Gum-like smile?

1:10:45.375 --> 1:10:47.375
What...? Do I look like him?

1:10:47.458 --> 1:10:51.667
A 45-year-old Park Bo Gum
growing blueberries in the country.

1:10:52.792 --> 1:10:53.792
Not funny.

1:11:03.083 --> 1:11:06.208
Anyway, what did you want to tell me?

1:11:07.375 --> 1:11:08.291
Oh, that...

1:11:08.375 --> 1:11:10.291
You had something to tell me.

1:11:20.625 --> 1:11:21.959
Ja-young,

1:11:31.750 --> 1:11:33.041
what I’m about to tell you...

1:11:33.125 --> 1:11:36.208
Hey, do you want to ride
the Ferris wheel tomorrow?

1:11:51.500 --> 1:11:52.458
What the hell?

1:11:54.500 --> 1:11:55.625
He looks so real.

1:12:00.083 --> 1:12:01.208
Shit.

1:12:03.208 --> 1:12:03.959
I'm hungry.

1:12:04.250 --> 1:12:05.500
Am I the shit or what?

1:12:20.250 --> 1:12:21.041
Let’s go one more time.

1:12:21.125 --> 1:12:22.250
- No...
- Why not?

1:12:22.333 --> 1:12:23.542
I'm dying.

1:12:23.625 --> 1:12:24.417
Come on, it’s fun.

1:12:24.500 --> 1:12:26.458
I’m going home, okay?

1:12:26.542 --> 1:12:28.834
Please collect your belongings
from the counter by the entrance.

1:12:28.917 --> 1:12:30.041
Your phone!

1:12:39.750 --> 1:12:40.625
There we are.

1:12:41.625 --> 1:12:43.417
Look at us.

1:12:43.500 --> 1:12:44.917
Check this out.

1:12:45.375 --> 1:12:46.750
I need the restroom.

1:12:47.458 --> 1:12:48.250
I’ll be here.

1:13:01.166 --> 1:13:04.250
- I’m on top, you on the bottom
- From A to Z except a relationship

1:13:04.333 --> 1:13:07.250
- A regular guy, not so regular girl
- It’s a grey area: holiday, and one-nighter, too

1:13:13.375 --> 1:13:16.500
- Isn’t she just a hypocritic sex maniac?
- They say one thing and act differently.

1:13:16.583 --> 1:13:19.583
- Need that kind of girl around me.
- Join LOVE BRIDGE, too!

1:13:19.667 --> 1:13:21.959
Thanks.
I’ll put it on my phone.

1:13:33.041 --> 1:13:35.667
Excuse me.
I just got off this ride.

1:13:36.208 --> 1:13:37.333
You came for your phone?

1:13:37.417 --> 1:13:38.834
- Is this yours?
- Thank you.

1:13:39.125 --> 1:13:41.208
A woman left it for you.

1:13:41.667 --> 1:13:44.291
CHIEF: your column hit 700,000!
LOVE BRIDGE wants to advertise!

1:14:05.959 --> 1:14:07.166
Ja-young!

1:14:14.458 --> 1:14:15.125
Ja-young.

1:14:15.417 --> 1:14:17.750
Ja-young, hey!

1:14:19.750 --> 1:14:20.709
Who the fuck are you?

1:14:20.959 --> 1:14:22.917
Let’s go somewhere and talk.

1:14:24.458 --> 1:14:28.375
We can talk here.
I’m scared to go anywhere with you.

1:14:32.834 --> 1:14:33.750
A column?

1:14:34.667 --> 1:14:37.291
What’s all this? Tell me.

1:14:41.583 --> 1:14:42.917
Yes, I wrote it.

1:14:45.166 --> 1:14:46.792
I’ve written five so far.

1:14:47.208 --> 1:14:48.417
And you met me to write it.

1:14:48.500 --> 1:14:49.750
It’s not like that.

1:14:50.291 --> 1:14:51.542
Then what?

1:14:52.792 --> 1:14:55.166
You approached me
intentionally for this.

1:14:55.959 --> 1:14:58.250
I’m sorry I didn’t tell you about it,

1:15:00.333 --> 1:15:01.959
but I was going to tell you
everything today.

1:15:02.041 --> 1:15:03.625
You were going to tell me?

1:15:04.375 --> 1:15:06.583
Am I supposed to say thank you?

1:15:07.625 --> 1:15:09.834
That explains your performance at the wedding.

1:15:09.917 --> 1:15:10.959
You know that’s not true.

1:15:11.041 --> 1:15:12.250
Why me?

1:15:15.500 --> 1:15:16.750
Do I look like an idiot?

1:15:16.834 --> 1:15:19.458
No! Of course not.

1:15:20.375 --> 1:15:21.166
Ja-young.

1:15:21.250 --> 1:15:22.875
So this is what you do.

1:15:23.542 --> 1:15:26.917
Have sex and write a column.
It must’ve been so much fun.

1:15:26.959 --> 1:15:30.417
That’s why you offered to
pay for drinks and rooms.

1:15:32.750 --> 1:15:34.625
Do you even feel guilty?

1:15:37.417 --> 1:15:41.750
You fucking sociopath!
I’m gonna sue you and your company.

1:15:41.834 --> 1:15:46.291
You can sue me, expose me,
do whatever you want,

1:15:46.792 --> 1:15:50.417
but what do you get
by walking out on me?

1:15:51.750 --> 1:15:53.625
Can you at least hear me out?

1:15:55.000 --> 1:15:56.208
I’m not the only one, am I?

1:15:56.542 --> 1:15:57.125
What?

1:15:57.208 --> 1:15:58.709
How many more are there?

1:15:58.792 --> 1:16:00.667
What are you talking about?

1:16:01.750 --> 1:16:04.834
How many women did you make
a fool out of on that dating app?

1:16:05.959 --> 1:16:10.208
I’ll take the column down.
It’s anonymous. No one knows it’s you.

1:16:10.291 --> 1:16:12.542
No, don’t.

1:16:18.083 --> 1:16:19.458
I’ll upload, too.

1:16:19.875 --> 1:16:20.709
I was victimized by Park Woori.

1:16:20.792 --> 1:16:21.917
Yes, I wrote it.

1:16:23.291 --> 1:16:24.750
I’ve written five so far.

1:16:25.417 --> 1:16:26.750
Well, this is fun.

1:16:26.834 --> 1:16:28.291
I don’t feel guilty as well.

1:16:40.542 --> 1:16:43.458
It’s a grey area:
holiday, and one-nighter, too.

1:16:43.667 --> 1:16:47.291
I felt cold, wet wind seeping into my body...

1:17:11.125 --> 1:17:14.959
#If you drink this,
you’re going out with me.

1:17:25.792 --> 1:17:29.750
I’ll make sure he goes to jail for this.

1:17:29.959 --> 1:17:32.458
You have nothing to worry about, okay?

1:17:32.542 --> 1:17:34.250
The internet detectives beat you to it.

1:17:34.333 --> 1:17:36.583
They dug up everything about him.
He got doxed.

1:17:39.125 --> 1:17:42.250
Way to go, IT powerhouse Korea.
Man, they’re fast.

1:17:43.083 --> 1:17:47.542
Let’s see... graduated from
Noil High in 2010...

1:17:47.917 --> 1:17:51.875
Creative Writing major
at Sinseok University…

1:17:51.959 --> 1:17:54.000
...joined magazine in 2019...

1:17:54.917 --> 1:17:56.375
What a sick maniac!

1:17:57.000 --> 1:18:00.417
Anyway, are you really this freaky,
or is he a really good writer?

1:18:00.500 --> 1:18:01.625
Hey!

1:18:01.667 --> 1:18:05.667
I'm just curious...

1:18:05.750 --> 1:18:08.250
- I don’t normally read this...
- Hey!

1:18:11.250 --> 1:18:14.583
People are tightly divided.

1:18:15.083 --> 1:18:18.291
One side is crucifying the guy,

1:18:18.375 --> 1:18:23.166
while the other side says his confession
is heartrending and you should forgive him

1:18:24.542 --> 1:18:26.458
...and marry him.

1:18:26.959 --> 1:18:28.917
Come to think of it,

1:18:29.000 --> 1:18:32.667
the column doesn’t specify you
as the female character.

1:18:32.709 --> 1:18:35.250
It’s hard to build a case
for defamation or libel.

1:18:35.333 --> 1:18:37.333
Your name isn’t mentioned
in the voice recording either.

1:18:37.417 --> 1:18:39.250
We may have no money,
but we have our fists.

1:18:39.625 --> 1:18:41.792
We’ll beat a confession out of him.

1:18:41.875 --> 1:18:43.417
Let’s beat him up!

1:18:43.834 --> 1:18:47.709
What’s wrong with you guys?
I'm fine.

1:18:47.834 --> 1:18:49.750
You don’t have to make this
more serious than it is.

1:18:49.875 --> 1:18:51.750
You’re really being ridiculous.

1:18:52.542 --> 1:18:55.208
Did you have a good laugh?
Then good for you.

1:18:55.750 --> 1:18:59.041
My name isn’t mentioned anywhere.
No harm done.

1:19:00.583 --> 1:19:02.542
You didn’t have to lock up for me.

1:19:04.750 --> 1:19:07.041
What I don't understand is...

1:19:08.208 --> 1:19:11.333
He came with me to my ex’s wedding.

1:19:13.208 --> 1:19:16.000
He accompanied me
on my revenge mission.

1:19:16.542 --> 1:19:21.583
And going to the wedding
actually helped me move on.

1:19:23.250 --> 1:19:25.625
And all that was just for show.

1:19:26.959 --> 1:19:28.709
To what end?

1:19:30.583 --> 1:19:34.583
He said he was sincere, and
wanted to tell me everything.

1:19:34.667 --> 1:19:39.834
Why did he do so before
stupidly getting caught?

1:19:43.959 --> 1:19:49.750
I fucking knew it would end
like this with him, too.

1:19:53.959 --> 1:19:55.875
I knew it.

1:20:33.875 --> 1:20:37.000
I made hangover soup.
- Love, Dad

1:20:45.834 --> 1:20:49.041
Can I get any lower than this?

1:20:49.458 --> 1:20:51.834
Stop. You’re disturbing dust!

1:20:53.125 --> 1:20:58.125
What are you flipping out about?

1:20:59.875 --> 1:21:01.792
Because I’m a sad side character.

1:21:02.375 --> 1:21:04.250
Side characters aren’t allowed to flip out?

1:21:08.959 --> 1:21:14.792
I’ll be 30 next year, grandma.
When will I become a main character?

1:21:17.208 --> 1:21:20.667
You look a bit like a main character today.

1:21:21.166 --> 1:21:22.166
What?

1:21:22.250 --> 1:21:27.000
You play the main character,
extra, and side characters, too.

1:21:27.458 --> 1:21:29.667
That’s the fun of life.

1:21:37.709 --> 1:21:40.917
He demanded all his columns be pulled,
and he handed in his resignation.

1:21:41.041 --> 1:21:44.417
He’s been referred to a disciplinary committee.
Maybe the girl sued.

1:21:44.500 --> 1:21:47.625
I heard the editor-in-chief knew
about her all along.

1:21:47.709 --> 1:21:49.834
She’s a steel-hearted bitch!

1:21:50.375 --> 1:21:53.709
Anyway, I knew he would end up like that.

Welcome to your favorite podcast
for older girls, “In My Time”!

1:22:52.542 --> 1:22:54.959
I’m your host, Ja-young the Lovely.

1:22:55.083 --> 1:22:57.792
With Lunar New Year 2022
around the corner,

1:22:57.875 --> 1:23:03.208
the theme for Episode 74 is,
“The Best Friend in My Life.”

1:23:03.291 --> 1:23:07.500
So, girls, tell us about your besties.

1:23:13.542 --> 1:23:16.333
What did I tell you?
That it would be a huge hit.

1:23:16.583 --> 1:23:19.667
No, you said she’d suffer endlessly
and shit blood.

1:23:23.583 --> 1:23:24.959
- Hi, Woori.
- Sir.

1:23:25.000 --> 1:23:27.917
- Can you cover until 5?
- Sorry?

1:23:28.000 --> 1:23:31.375
The next shift guy can’t make it.

1:23:32.208 --> 1:23:35.291
- Stock the ramen shelves?
- Got it.

1:23:35.375 --> 1:23:40.166
I went over the CCTV footage for security.

1:23:40.458 --> 1:23:44.375
You’re reading books too much
during your shift.

1:23:45.417 --> 1:23:48.125
You should’ve found a job
at a bookstore.

1:23:48.333 --> 1:23:49.375
Sorry.

1:23:50.709 --> 1:23:52.250
- See you later.
- Okay.

1:24:04.041 --> 1:24:05.041
Grandma.

1:24:06.166 --> 1:24:06.917
Yeah?

1:24:07.834 --> 1:24:13.000
I bet listeners will love
your night winner story.

1:24:13.291 --> 1:24:14.917
- Yeah?
- Of course.

1:24:15.000 --> 1:24:19.333
I’m happy as long as you are.

1:24:20.458 --> 1:24:21.834
What’s your secret?

1:24:23.166 --> 1:24:26.166
How did the secret rendezvous
by the mill become your love?

1:24:27.083 --> 1:24:31.458
Where you meet isn’t important.

1:24:32.959 --> 1:24:38.959
If you’re meant to be,
you’ll end up together.

1:24:39.083 --> 1:24:44.417
Really? If it’s meant to be?

1:24:45.875 --> 1:24:48.917
Is there someone?

1:24:53.417 --> 1:24:55.333
Someone I want to be with?

1:25:07.291 --> 1:25:10.250
What do you think love is?

1:25:10.583 --> 1:25:16.333
Love? I’m not sure.

1:25:21.583 --> 1:25:23.417
I used to write a novel.

1:25:24.667 --> 1:25:27.500
All I wanted was
to be stinking rich,

1:25:27.583 --> 1:25:29.250
but eventually I gave up.

1:25:31.000 --> 1:25:35.000
My favorite writer said,

1:25:36.750 --> 1:25:40.000
“If you have not loved,
you can’t write.”

1:25:41.792 --> 1:25:47.166
Ever since then,
I haven’t been able to write.

1:25:49.125 --> 1:25:50.917
Want me to make you write again?

1:26:28.959 --> 1:26:29.834
I can do it!

1:26:30.291 --> 1:26:31.542
I’m the protagonist of my life!

1:26:45.959 --> 1:26:46.792
Guestbook

1:26:46.875 --> 1:26:50.166
Not knowing who paid how much
at his wedding

1:26:50.208 --> 1:26:52.875
will kill him for the rest of his life.

1:27:15.500 --> 1:27:20.125
Park Wooroa $10

1:27:33.834 --> 1:27:38.041
Come over to my house.
I’ll make New Year’s soup.

1:27:38.125 --> 1:27:41.250
I’ll pass.
I’ve got something to do.

1:27:41.333 --> 1:27:43.667
Your New Year’s ritual?

1:27:44.083 --> 1:27:45.917
Blood donation and
buckwheat noodles?

1:27:46.000 --> 1:27:47.000
No.

1:27:47.625 --> 1:27:52.083
My husband’s friends are here,
including the Park Bo Gum lookalike.

1:27:52.166 --> 1:27:52.959
Park Bo Gum?

1:27:53.041 --> 1:27:54.375
Yeah, he’s here.

1:27:55.709 --> 1:27:56.750
Okay.

1:28:00.792 --> 1:28:01.709
That’ll be $36.

1:28:01.792 --> 1:28:04.291
- There you go.
- Thank you.

1:28:04.375 --> 1:28:06.250
- Bye.
- Happy New Year.

1:28:06.667 --> 1:28:08.834
Can’t let good food go to waste.

1:28:25.750 --> 1:28:28.709
Ja-young? Ja-young?

1:28:30.709 --> 1:28:34.291
Who are you?
Do I know you?

1:28:35.792 --> 1:28:37.875
So you only come here
on New Year’s Day?

1:28:37.959 --> 1:28:41.208
I came here a few times
thinking about you.

1:28:41.291 --> 1:28:44.166
You don’t even
understand buckwheat noodles.

1:28:45.458 --> 1:28:48.083
What are you talking about?
I’m from up north.

1:28:50.834 --> 1:28:53.583
I gave blood before coming here.
Look.

1:28:54.166 --> 1:28:57.000
I almost passed out
when the needle went in.

1:28:57.542 --> 1:28:59.291
Why did you do it?

1:29:01.792 --> 1:29:03.083
Ja-young…

1:29:06.750 --> 1:29:09.166
I really thought hard about this.

1:29:11.417 --> 1:29:13.250
I think we’re ready for it.

1:29:14.625 --> 1:29:15.542
For what?

1:29:16.709 --> 1:29:17.625
A relationship.

1:29:18.750 --> 1:29:21.834
I will make up for
all the wrong I did to you.

1:29:24.125 --> 1:29:26.166
We’ve done everything together
except that.

1:29:27.542 --> 1:29:29.709
What more is there to it anyway,

1:29:31.542 --> 1:29:34.834
besides liking each other,
caring for each other,

1:29:34.917 --> 1:29:36.500
and having a good time together?

1:29:36.583 --> 1:29:39.291
And why would I do that with you?

1:29:42.542 --> 1:29:44.250
Should... we love then?

1:29:48.500 --> 1:29:54.000
Very much so, moderately so, somewhat,
we make an awesome couple...

1:29:54.083 --> 1:29:55.250
Hey.

1:29:55.333 --> 1:29:56.333
Ja-young.

1:29:59.709 --> 1:30:01.166
I missed you.

1:30:25.291 --> 1:30:29.417
Ja-young, why did you come here?

1:30:40.959 --> 1:30:45.208
Ja-young, can I come with you?

1:30:47.333 --> 1:30:48.458
Huh?

1:30:49.709 --> 1:30:50.959
I’m coming with you.

1:30:53.583 --> 1:30:56.291
Can this movie be a romance movie?

1:30:57.250 --> 1:30:59.083
What will it take?

1:30:59.834 --> 1:31:03.333
A sweet love confession?
A romantic kiss?

1:31:04.709 --> 1:31:08.291
Even if we don’t have that
or break up eventually

1:31:08.375 --> 1:31:10.667
I hope it won’t be a bad story

1:31:11.000 --> 1:31:13.917
because this is our special romance.
