WEBVTT

01:15.440 --> 01:17.160
You didn't need to come.

01:19.160 --> 01:21.199
By the sounds of it, I did.

01:21.200 --> 01:23.200
What did she say to you?

01:24.320 --> 01:26.999
What's going on, Bec?

01:27.000 --> 01:29.279
Well, my mum's just died.

01:29.280 --> 01:31.720
Yeah, I know that.
I mean, what's going on with you?

01:33.280 --> 01:35.639
Am I not allowed a night out?
Of course you are.

01:35.640 --> 01:37.679
Everyone's entitled
to a night out.

01:37.680 --> 01:39.639
I'm just wondering
why Ros is calling me up

01:39.640 --> 01:41.359
saying how worried she is
about you.

01:41.360 --> 01:42.520
She needn't be.

01:43.680 --> 01:45.479
OK. Well...

01:45.480 --> 01:46.680
I'm worried about you.

01:48.320 --> 01:50.919
You're being off.
You're not acting right.

01:50.920 --> 01:52.400
I just feel...

01:53.760 --> 01:55.599
..so on my own.

01:55.600 --> 01:57.160
What? Here?

01:58.080 --> 01:59.479
No.

01:59.480 --> 02:03.160
Just on my own...
handling everything.

02:04.320 --> 02:05.799
HE SCOFFS

02:05.800 --> 02:07.959
On your own? Are you joking me?

02:07.960 --> 02:09.719
Do you know
what I've been doing all week?

02:09.720 --> 02:11.599
Chasing round
after our AWOL daughter

02:11.600 --> 02:13.519
and making sure
you don't hear about it. Mol?

02:13.520 --> 02:15.439
Yeah. Did one
with her lovely new boyfriend.

02:15.440 --> 02:18.159
I didn't mither you about it,
cos you've enough on your plate.

02:18.160 --> 02:19.799
How long was she gone? Is she OK?

02:19.800 --> 02:22.519
She's absolutely fine. I had
a few days sweating it out, mind,

02:22.520 --> 02:24.839
and not telling you.
But, yeah, you're on your own(!)

02:24.840 --> 02:26.519
Oh, my God! I need to call her.
No, no.

02:26.520 --> 02:28.359
She's with your dad.
You'll talk to me.

02:28.360 --> 02:29.720
Go on.

02:32.440 --> 02:34.160
She killed herself.

02:37.240 --> 02:39.320
What?
Took a load of morphine.

02:42.000 --> 02:43.800
Oh, jeez, Bec, I...

02:44.800 --> 02:46.360
Oh, Becca.

03:23.480 --> 03:25.080
So, who's this lot?

03:26.640 --> 03:29.640
Ah... that's the fella
she had the affair with.

03:35.360 --> 03:37.480
What do you think
she was playing at?

03:42.320 --> 03:46.239
So... So, this house,
it was your mum's?

03:46.240 --> 03:48.639
No, it was her mum's.

03:48.640 --> 03:49.960
Her birth mum.

03:52.920 --> 03:53.960
Wow.

03:55.000 --> 03:57.079
Yeah, it's a lot.

03:57.080 --> 03:59.959
And what happens now, then?
Your dad gets it?

03:59.960 --> 04:03.200
No, it's ours. Mine and Ros's.

04:04.400 --> 04:05.440
Right.

04:06.880 --> 04:08.280
We can't sell it.

04:09.880 --> 04:11.519
It's in a trust

04:11.520 --> 04:15.919
for the betterment of the women
in the family, whatever that means.

04:15.920 --> 04:17.040
This is all crackers.

04:18.200 --> 04:19.640
That's why your head's gone.

04:22.560 --> 04:23.760
We're not happy.

04:27.560 --> 04:29.519
Are we not?

04:29.520 --> 04:31.359
It's nice of you
to tell me how I feel (!)

04:31.360 --> 04:33.479
I... I'm not happy.

04:33.480 --> 04:36.199
Clearly.
Because you call all the shots.

04:36.200 --> 04:37.880
What does that even mean?

04:40.920 --> 04:43.319
OK. Who's... Who's our team?

04:43.320 --> 04:45.039
Man United.
What do we watch on telly?

04:45.040 --> 04:47.759
Anything with Freddie Flintoff
in it.

04:47.760 --> 04:50.959
Who's our band? The Stone Roses.
I don't even like the Stone Roses!

04:50.960 --> 04:52.399
Yeah, you do.
No, I don't.

04:52.400 --> 04:54.439
Why are you ragging
everything that we like now?

04:54.440 --> 04:57.759
No. What YOU like
that has somehow become our life.

04:57.760 --> 05:01.199
Oh, give over.
Our life together is the girls.

05:01.200 --> 05:03.479
Our family.
That's what's important.

05:03.480 --> 05:06.599
Well, you say that, but you
don't... take an interest in me.

05:06.600 --> 05:09.199
Oh, really? What about me?
Who am I - chopped liver?

05:09.200 --> 05:11.319
What?
You don't let me be anything.

05:11.320 --> 05:13.319
Why do you need permission
to be something?

05:13.320 --> 05:15.319
Well, you tell me.
You made it that way.

05:15.320 --> 05:17.199
You're in charge.
I can't even go to the pub

05:17.200 --> 05:19.239
without you telling me
how to piss straight!

05:19.240 --> 05:20.960
I don't want this life!

05:22.560 --> 05:24.199
I feel like I'm slowly dying here,

05:24.200 --> 05:26.640
and you're just coming out
with some smart-arse comment!

05:33.160 --> 05:34.800
OK.

05:35.760 --> 05:36.800
OK.

05:38.600 --> 05:39.799
Where are you going?

05:39.800 --> 05:42.079
You don't want this shit life
we've got together.

05:42.080 --> 05:45.039
You want to do one here
like your mum. Fine.

05:45.040 --> 05:47.119
I'm going to find a B&B.

05:47.120 --> 05:49.479
Call me if you need
anything practical doing.

05:49.480 --> 05:51.320
But me and you right now...

05:59.960 --> 06:02.279
Did Mum come on the boat with you?

06:02.280 --> 06:05.039
SHE LAUGHS
Oh, God, no!

06:05.040 --> 06:09.719
She used to say that she
could get seasick in her bathtub.

06:09.720 --> 06:12.680
But she'd come down here,
and we'd sit... talk.

06:14.880 --> 06:17.039
What did she talk to you about?

06:17.040 --> 06:20.439
Life. Day to day. You know.

06:20.440 --> 06:22.360
I don't, really.
Oh.

06:23.760 --> 06:25.839
She ever talk about me?
Oh, honey!

06:25.840 --> 06:28.039
Yes. Jeez!

06:28.040 --> 06:31.080
"Rosaline lives in London."
That was your official title.

06:32.040 --> 06:34.040
God, was she proud of you.

06:35.480 --> 06:36.920
She never said.

06:38.240 --> 06:39.280
Did she have to?

06:40.600 --> 06:41.760
She did, actually.

06:43.080 --> 06:45.640
What would you say to her
if she were here right now?

06:47.600 --> 06:49.879
I'd probably start with
"Christ on a bike, Mum!"

06:49.880 --> 06:52.439
SHE LAUGHS
Well, that's good for openers.

06:52.440 --> 06:53.879
Then what?

06:53.880 --> 06:56.760
Why lie?
What were you thinking?

07:00.240 --> 07:01.840
Who were you when you were here?

07:05.480 --> 07:06.639
Why not give me the chance

07:06.640 --> 07:08.519
to at least talk you round
for a few months,

07:08.520 --> 07:10.200
spend some time with you?

07:14.600 --> 07:15.960
DOOR OPENS

07:18.720 --> 07:20.360
Cheers for that.

07:23.720 --> 07:25.160
Where is he now?

07:26.440 --> 07:28.359
I don't know.
Maybe you could call him,

07:28.360 --> 07:30.119
cos you're such good mates now.

07:30.120 --> 07:31.480
KNOCK AT DOOR

07:35.640 --> 07:38.919
Alan Artus, repatriation service.

07:38.920 --> 07:40.280
We spoke on the phone.

07:41.440 --> 07:44.039
Said I could pop around
when I had the say-so.

07:44.040 --> 07:47.559
Oh, erm... we're not quite ready,
I don't think.

07:47.560 --> 07:48.999
I had a phone call
from the morgue

07:49.000 --> 07:51.599
saying she'll be ready for the off
in two days.

07:51.600 --> 07:53.239
We need to go through
some paperwork.

07:53.240 --> 07:56.200
My sister and I need to talk about
this. We'll be in touch. Thanks.

08:01.400 --> 08:03.680
So that's it.
We can take her home.

08:09.280 --> 08:10.760
What should we do with this place?

08:14.400 --> 08:16.919
Rent it out.
May as well make some money off it.

08:16.920 --> 08:20.359
I'm not doing it.
We can get a letting agent.

08:20.360 --> 08:22.599
That's not what she wanted.

08:22.600 --> 08:24.720
We don't always get what we want.

08:33.760 --> 08:35.079
Mol?
Yeah?

08:35.080 --> 08:37.200
Put some more fruit
on this, please. Yeah.

08:39.880 --> 08:41.319
Buckwheat pancakes, Grandad.

08:41.320 --> 08:43.359
What's buckwheat
when it's at home?

08:43.360 --> 08:45.599
Keeps you regular.

08:45.600 --> 08:47.840
Set your watch by me.
Eurgh!

08:49.360 --> 08:51.599
Like that?
Yeah. Thank you.

08:51.600 --> 08:53.719
Here you go.

08:53.720 --> 08:55.639
Oi, give up!
You're gonna ruin me picture.

08:55.640 --> 08:57.040
I'm hungry!

08:59.360 --> 09:00.840
You all right, Grandad?

09:04.720 --> 09:05.920
Yeah.

09:09.360 --> 09:12.999
All right, Richard, mate.
Just checking in.

09:13.000 --> 09:14.520
RICHARD ON PHONE: 'I'm coming over.'

09:16.920 --> 09:19.680
Are you at the airport?
'Yes, I am.

09:20.880 --> 09:22.000
'I'm with Lauren and Mol.'

09:23.520 --> 09:25.639
You, erm... You... You never said.

09:25.640 --> 09:28.960
'No? Well, I'm telling you now.
I'll call you when I land.'

09:40.680 --> 09:46.359
Look, I'm sorry for turning up
unannounced like this,

09:46.360 --> 09:48.959
but there's something
I need to say about your mother,

09:48.960 --> 09:51.160
and... it's difficult for me.

09:54.280 --> 09:56.839
You need to know that when
she was given the diagnosis,

09:56.840 --> 09:58.599
I wanted to care for her.
ROSALINE SCOFFS

09:58.600 --> 10:01.399
Well, my dad might have had
something to say about that.

10:01.400 --> 10:03.080
I was gonna look after her.

10:05.160 --> 10:09.959
And yet, she was planning
her death all along.

10:09.960 --> 10:11.320
And Cathy...

10:12.680 --> 10:13.800
And Cathy what?

10:16.400 --> 10:19.119
She was different
when she was with Cathy.

10:19.120 --> 10:22.519
They talked a lot.
Well, we talked a lot.

10:22.520 --> 10:23.640
They talked...

10:24.960 --> 10:27.760
Do you know what she does? Cathy?

10:29.680 --> 10:33.320
She... looks after
people who are dying.

10:35.440 --> 10:37.559
She's a nurse?
No.

10:37.560 --> 10:39.319
She's not a nurse. She's a...

10:39.320 --> 10:42.360
healer or a...
I don't know what she is.

10:43.600 --> 10:48.639
But she spends a lot of time with
people who are very sick and...

10:48.640 --> 10:50.880
And what?

10:54.360 --> 10:55.720
I think...

10:57.360 --> 11:00.319
..Cathy gave Mary the morphine.

11:00.320 --> 11:02.880
Why would Cathy give Mum morphine?

11:03.960 --> 11:06.079
Because she asked for it.

11:06.080 --> 11:07.559
Because she could.

11:07.560 --> 11:09.679
I don't know what goes through
that woman's head.

11:09.680 --> 11:12.959
But if there's even a small chance
that Cathy gave it to her,

11:12.960 --> 11:16.360
and I think there is,
then you deserve to know.

11:28.560 --> 11:30.319
Did you give Mum the morphine?

11:30.320 --> 11:33.680
Oh, well,
I guess you'd better come on in.

11:36.080 --> 11:38.879
I don't know
where you girls heard that,

11:38.880 --> 11:40.439
but it's just utter nonsense.

11:40.440 --> 11:41.999
Come on,
let me get you both a drink.

11:42.000 --> 11:44.239
Enough with the Southern
bonhomie bullshit, Cathy.

11:44.240 --> 11:46.560
Did my mother
get the morphine from you?

11:51.680 --> 11:54.039
She took it from my cupboard.

11:54.040 --> 11:55.519
Why didn't you stop her?

11:55.520 --> 11:58.079
Don't you think I would've tried
if I'd known?

11:58.080 --> 12:00.199
By the time I realised,
it was too late.

12:00.200 --> 12:02.479
Why the fuck
have you got morphine anyway?

12:02.480 --> 12:05.999
I'm... uh,
like a midwife for the dying.

12:06.000 --> 12:08.200
The term is "end-of-life doula".

12:09.720 --> 12:11.079
What, so you play God?

12:11.080 --> 12:12.599
Oh, no, no, no. I...

12:12.600 --> 12:14.639
I hold a hand. I put some music on.

12:14.640 --> 12:17.639
I... I offer a kind word and...

12:17.640 --> 12:20.999
and I give pain relief
when necessary.

12:21.000 --> 12:22.959
Morphine's illegal, last I heard.

12:22.960 --> 12:25.679
That morphine
was for my own personal use.

12:25.680 --> 12:27.679
But you just said
you give pain relief.

12:27.680 --> 12:31.039
Mostly I use cannabis.
Mostly?!

12:31.040 --> 12:32.799
And if all you had at home
was cannabis,

12:32.800 --> 12:34.759
our mum would be
really fucking stoned now,

12:34.760 --> 12:36.199
but she'd still be here.

12:36.200 --> 12:38.239
Did she talk to you
about taking her own life?

12:38.240 --> 12:40.119
We talked about dying.

12:40.120 --> 12:42.919
What it looked like,
what it felt like.

12:42.920 --> 12:45.159
I knew she was
deeply troubled by it.

12:45.160 --> 12:48.119
Well, people are.
Oh, for God's sake!

12:48.120 --> 12:50.079
Why didn't you tell us?

12:50.080 --> 12:52.480
The day she died,
it looked like natural causes.

12:53.640 --> 12:56.599
By the time I figured out
that the morphine was gone,

12:56.600 --> 12:59.359
I mean, you were here, but
I didn't want to hurt you, girls.

12:59.360 --> 13:01.119
You were covering your arse,
more like.

13:01.120 --> 13:04.440
Yeah, maybe I was. What would
you have done, Rosaline?

13:06.880 --> 13:08.320
I would've gone to the police.

13:09.480 --> 13:11.120
I would've said that I knew.

13:12.360 --> 13:15.359
I would not have looked us
straight in the eye

13:15.360 --> 13:17.480
and blatantly lied.

13:19.960 --> 13:23.200
All right, come on.
I want to show you both something.

13:24.600 --> 13:26.600
Just come with me. Please.

13:37.480 --> 13:39.040
Here.

13:48.160 --> 13:50.319
MARY SIGHS

13:50.320 --> 13:53.639

Oh, God, just improvise. Wing it!

MARY LAUGHS

13:56.160 --> 13:58.039
Top up my wine, can you?

13:58.040 --> 13:59.800
Oh, you're so demanding!

MARY TALKS

14:06.080 --> 14:07.400
Right...

14:10.080 --> 14:11.200
Thank you.

14:13.360 --> 14:15.800
Right... Right.

14:17.560 --> 14:19.639
What I want to do...

14:19.640 --> 14:21.519
What I want to do is say...

14:21.520 --> 14:24.160
what I want to happen
when something happens to me.

14:25.680 --> 14:27.479
'Well, that's about
as clear as mud!'

Go on. Just go on, please.

14:30.280 --> 14:33.399
Just focus. Breathe.

14:33.400 --> 14:35.279
You got it.
Shh!

14:35.280 --> 14:37.040
Yeah, OK.

14:42.600 --> 14:44.040
What I'd like...

14:45.320 --> 14:47.360
to say is,
what I'd like to happen...

14:50.000 --> 14:51.240
..when I die.

14:58.160 --> 14:59.720
I want to stay here.

15:03.640 --> 15:06.959
SOBBING: I can't do this.
It's just stupid!

15:06.960 --> 15:08.919
It's just too much.
No, no, honey,

15:08.920 --> 15:12.480
you don't have to do anything
you don't want to do.

15:14.200 --> 15:17.639
She wanted you to know
that she wanted to be here.

15:17.640 --> 15:21.799
She felt that if she went home...

15:21.800 --> 15:23.040
your father...

15:25.480 --> 15:26.519
What?

15:26.520 --> 15:29.599
That your father would not be able
to give her the care

15:29.600 --> 15:31.719
that she would've gotten here.

15:31.720 --> 15:33.400
No, but I would.

15:35.080 --> 15:37.599
So she went to your father

15:37.600 --> 15:41.359
and told him what was happening
and what she wanted.

15:41.360 --> 15:44.200
He didn't know that she had
Alzheimer's, though, did he?

15:50.280 --> 15:53.519
She was scared
that when the day finally came

15:53.520 --> 15:55.640
that he'd force her
to come back to the UK.

15:59.600 --> 16:01.879
Did she ask you to help her?

16:01.880 --> 16:04.159
We talked about it...

16:04.160 --> 16:07.720
hypothetically, but never
with any kind of seriousness.

16:09.760 --> 16:11.040
I wouldn't have done it.

16:12.880 --> 16:14.520
I wanted her here.

16:16.600 --> 16:18.280
I want her here.

16:22.920 --> 16:25.680
I'm so fucking mad at her.

16:27.280 --> 16:28.960
Do you have
any other videos of her?

16:30.240 --> 16:33.759
I don't need to see any more.
I remember what she looked like.

16:33.760 --> 16:35.720
This is all manipulation.

16:37.000 --> 16:39.440
I'm going to the police.
Ros...

16:52.880 --> 16:55.119
You're not really going
to the police station, are you?

16:55.120 --> 16:56.320
Yes, I am.

16:57.680 --> 16:59.799
Why, what are you doing?
Are you not coming?

16:59.800 --> 17:00.880
Yeah, what am I doing?

17:02.760 --> 17:04.240
It's a really good question.

17:54.680 --> 17:56.080
All right?

18:03.320 --> 18:05.719
Are you OK?
Not really.

18:05.720 --> 18:07.800
You?
No.

18:09.280 --> 18:11.520
Look, I need to tell you something.

18:17.680 --> 18:19.759
I kissed a lad the other night.

18:19.760 --> 18:22.319
What?
It didn't mean anything.

18:22.320 --> 18:23.839
Who... Who was he?

18:23.840 --> 18:27.159
Oh, just some bloke in a club.

18:27.160 --> 18:30.159
Right. OK. And...

18:30.160 --> 18:33.679
was it just a kiss or...
was there more?

18:33.680 --> 18:35.759
No. No.

18:35.760 --> 18:37.400
HE SCOFFS

18:41.800 --> 18:43.999
Have you gone off me, Bec?
No, not at all.

18:44.000 --> 18:45.599
Then why are you telling me this?

18:45.600 --> 18:48.799
Because it was stupid and I...
I want to be honest.

18:48.800 --> 18:51.640
Oh, right. Yeah. Get it off your
chest and make me feel like shit!

18:52.880 --> 18:54.720
Sorry.
What's wrong with you?

18:57.480 --> 18:58.720
Everything.

19:04.600 --> 19:06.920
PHONE RINGS

19:09.840 --> 19:12.639
It's your dad. He's at the airport
with the girls.

19:12.640 --> 19:15.359
I've got to pick him up.
What's my dad doing here?

19:15.360 --> 19:16.959
Hello, Richard.

19:16.960 --> 19:19.200
Yeah, I'm just leaving now, mate.

19:20.680 --> 19:22.440
Yeah. OK, I'll see you there.

19:41.600 --> 19:42.960
Where to?

19:45.960 --> 19:47.440
Shall I choose?

19:49.960 --> 19:51.000
OK.

19:53.120 --> 19:55.080
You said you didn't take cards.

19:56.440 --> 19:59.160
Oh, yeah. So I did.

20:03.760 --> 20:07.440
Hey. Hey, Mol, you OK?
Yeah.

20:09.040 --> 20:11.000
You OK, Dad?
Been better.

20:12.000 --> 20:14.560
You never said you were coming.
Well, here I am anyway.

20:15.680 --> 20:18.879
Who is dealing with getting
your mother back to the UK?

20:18.880 --> 20:21.759
Er, a repatriation service.

20:21.760 --> 20:24.159
A bloke came around.
Rosaline's got his number.

20:24.160 --> 20:25.760
Well, I should like
to speak to him.

20:29.720 --> 20:32.680
I'm just so angry.
Who with?

20:35.440 --> 20:37.599
My mum's friend Cathy
for being a liar.

20:37.600 --> 20:39.599
Becca for being a fanny.
HE LAUGHS

20:39.600 --> 20:43.359
What?
Fanny. Just a strong word.

20:43.360 --> 20:45.400
And not used nearly enough,
in my opinion.

20:47.040 --> 20:49.479
We were having this awful argument
about everything -

20:49.480 --> 20:51.719
Mum, me, her, who she thinks I am,

20:51.720 --> 20:53.319
who I know she is.

20:53.320 --> 20:56.199
I just kept thinking, what
I'm most mad about isn't today.

20:56.200 --> 20:57.519
It's 30 years old, this stuff.

20:57.520 --> 21:00.079
And how can you be mad at someone
for looking after you?

21:00.080 --> 21:03.159
Cos that's what she did.
She looked after me.

21:03.160 --> 21:05.399
And you feel you should
be grateful for it, like?

21:05.400 --> 21:06.999
Yeah.

21:07.000 --> 21:09.959
And how do you actually feel?

21:09.960 --> 21:11.919
Really fucking resentful.
Why?

21:11.920 --> 21:14.840
Because everything's always been
all right for her.

21:16.160 --> 21:19.399
It doesn't seem like it is now,
though, right?

21:19.400 --> 21:22.760
It sounds like the wheels
have come right off, no?

21:24.320 --> 21:25.360
Yeah.

21:27.240 --> 21:29.239
They really have.

21:29.240 --> 21:31.640
PHONE VIBRATES

21:37.160 --> 21:39.680
Sorry, I've got to get this.
It's all right.

21:42.600 --> 21:43.760
Hello?

21:48.000 --> 21:50.039
Oh, thank God.

21:50.040 --> 21:53.080
Yeah. Thank you.

21:55.320 --> 21:57.040
Yeah. Great.

21:58.440 --> 22:00.280
Bye. Thank you.

22:07.520 --> 22:10.719
I was just waiting on
some results, and it's fine.

22:10.720 --> 22:11.840
That's good.

22:14.160 --> 22:18.599
Oh, look where we are.
Coming up to the fairy bridge.

22:18.600 --> 22:21.680
Ready? Don't leave me hanging.

22:25.880 --> 22:27.480
BOTH: Hello, fairies!

22:29.440 --> 22:32.560
There you go.
They'll look after you now.

23:03.480 --> 23:04.839
Ah, mint.

23:04.840 --> 23:06.640
Oi, Mol, come look at this view.

23:08.360 --> 23:09.880
Rogue's gallery.

23:11.320 --> 23:12.360
Dad...

23:22.720 --> 23:24.080
HE SLAMS
THE PHOTO DOWN

23:29.680 --> 23:32.040
Anyone want a cup of tea,
juice or owt?

23:33.720 --> 23:36.479
Mol, help me with the drinks.
I'm not thirsty.

23:36.480 --> 23:37.760
Please.

23:40.160 --> 23:43.040
Did Dad come out here?
Nope.

23:57.840 --> 24:01.240
Are you all right?
Yeah. Why?

24:02.840 --> 24:04.799
What's Dad said?

24:04.800 --> 24:08.239
He's been a right pain.
Thinks he's you.

24:08.240 --> 24:09.840
Er...

24:11.080 --> 24:13.399
Well, he told me
about your new boyfriend.

24:13.400 --> 24:15.559
Why would he do that?

24:15.560 --> 24:17.160
Because I got it out of him.

24:19.600 --> 24:20.959
You know, everyone thinks

24:20.960 --> 24:23.840
that you don't know
what you're doing when you're 16.

24:25.160 --> 24:28.479
I was never more certain of
who I was than when I was your age.

24:28.480 --> 24:30.959
So, are you cool
with me being with Connor?

24:30.960 --> 24:33.439
Er, no. No. Not at all.

24:33.440 --> 24:35.240
Don't mistake me for that parent.

24:36.960 --> 24:39.679
Just... me and your dad
are worried.

24:39.680 --> 24:42.119
Hey, we want you to be safe.

24:42.120 --> 24:45.200
We don't know this lad,
and you're not telling us anything.

24:47.120 --> 24:48.680
Are you serious about him?

24:50.720 --> 24:52.679
He's funny. That's all.

24:52.680 --> 24:54.640
I like him.
I'm not gonna marry him.

24:56.160 --> 24:57.920
OK, it's just...

24:59.120 --> 25:02.840
..it's only five minutes ago, you
were my little Miss Molly-Moo-Moo.

25:04.560 --> 25:07.640
Now look at you.
I miss Gran.

25:09.480 --> 25:10.720
I know, darling.

25:12.200 --> 25:13.520
So do I.

25:34.400 --> 25:36.039
Where are we going?

25:36.040 --> 25:38.479
This is where I murder people.
Well, that's a relief.

25:38.480 --> 25:40.679
HE CHUCKLES
When I was a kid,

25:40.680 --> 25:42.919
me and me brother,
we used to cycle down here.

25:42.920 --> 25:46.519
Over there there's, like,
an old munitions building.

25:46.520 --> 25:48.279
It's all overgrown with trees.

25:48.280 --> 25:50.359
It was perfect for hide and seek.

25:50.360 --> 25:51.560
SHE CHUCKLES

25:52.760 --> 25:54.479
How old were you?

25:54.480 --> 25:55.839
27.

25:55.840 --> 25:57.560
BOTH LAUGH

26:07.120 --> 26:08.520
Not bad.

26:10.040 --> 26:11.360
You OK?

26:13.400 --> 26:16.839
Oh... just trying
to stay in the moment.

26:16.840 --> 26:17.880
And?

26:19.120 --> 26:21.159
Still angry.

26:21.160 --> 26:24.399
Yeah. Well, that's the problem

26:24.400 --> 26:26.879
with the insistence
of living only in the moment.

26:26.880 --> 26:29.679
I mean, you know, unless
you're a goldfish, like, you...

26:29.680 --> 26:31.639
you remember all the other moments.

26:31.640 --> 26:33.800
And they connect... unfortunately.

26:36.440 --> 26:38.199
You need to get out your own head
for a bit.

26:38.200 --> 26:41.480
Oh, got any hard drugs?
Get in there.

26:42.720 --> 26:44.760
Wild swim it out of you.

26:46.160 --> 26:47.800
Really?

26:49.040 --> 26:52.680
It's really beneficial.
SHE LAUGHS

26:54.560 --> 26:57.200
No way!
Yes way. Come on.

26:58.400 --> 27:00.359
Come on.

27:00.360 --> 27:02.839
You are joking!

27:02.840 --> 27:05.079
Like, really?
Really.

27:05.080 --> 27:06.480
Jesus.

27:07.680 --> 27:08.920
No!

27:11.600 --> 27:12.959
Oh, no!

27:12.960 --> 27:14.120
No!

27:15.280 --> 27:16.840
Oh, my God!

27:19.480 --> 27:21.080
SHE SQUEALS

27:22.440 --> 27:24.359
I think I've trodden on something.

27:24.360 --> 27:25.919
Three...
No, wait.

27:25.920 --> 27:27.319
..two...
Argh!

27:27.320 --> 27:28.639
..one.
Argh!

27:28.640 --> 27:31.119
Go!
No. Aargh! Oh, my...

27:31.120 --> 27:33.399
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

27:33.400 --> 27:35.199
Oh, my God!

27:35.200 --> 27:37.159
Awful, awful...

27:37.160 --> 27:39.440
Oh, my God...

27:42.680 --> 27:44.160
Whoo!

27:46.160 --> 27:48.040
SHE SHRIEKS

27:55.040 --> 27:56.480
Ros, where are you?

27:57.600 --> 27:58.840
Dad's here.

27:59.840 --> 28:01.359
On the island.

28:01.360 --> 28:03.000
Can you call me back?

28:09.560 --> 28:11.320
Have you got that fella's number?

28:12.560 --> 28:14.799
What, you mean...?

28:14.800 --> 28:18.039
Repatriation man.
Oh... yeah.

28:18.040 --> 28:21.680
Er, I think he left his card.
I'll... I'll get it for you.

28:24.200 --> 28:27.280
Dad...
What are we doing for tea?

28:31.080 --> 28:33.080
ROS SHIVERS

28:36.480 --> 28:39.239
When did you discover
wild swimming?

28:39.240 --> 28:41.039
Today.
What?

28:41.040 --> 28:43.119
You've never done that before?

28:43.120 --> 28:45.319
But you said you used to come here
with your brother.

28:45.320 --> 28:47.479
Yeah, but we never used to go in.
We're not daft.

28:47.480 --> 28:48.879
It's bloody freezing!

28:48.880 --> 28:51.839
We could've died
from cold water shock.

28:51.840 --> 28:55.320
You said it was beneficial.
Are you still furious?

28:56.640 --> 28:58.839
No.
Oh. Well, then.

28:58.840 --> 29:00.320
Beneficial.

29:20.680 --> 29:21.960
Oh...

29:23.120 --> 29:25.640
You bastard!
HE CHUCKLES

29:27.080 --> 29:29.920
Oh!
Come on. Kiss me again.

29:34.760 --> 29:37.279
Cheers. I'll be back to take
your order in a minute.

29:37.280 --> 29:39.639
Thank you.
DAD: I can't sit here.

29:39.640 --> 29:41.360
Force nine draught.

29:42.640 --> 29:44.520
Right, well, you sit here,
then, Dad.

29:49.000 --> 29:50.280
Thanks, darling.

29:51.720 --> 29:55.479
Oh, my God.
Look at the size of you two!

29:55.480 --> 29:57.159
Have they had you in compost?!

29:57.160 --> 30:00.360
Hello. Sorry I'm late.

30:01.680 --> 30:04.439
Oh. You needn't have come, Dad.
We'd have sorted it.

30:04.440 --> 30:06.239
Ah, well. I thought I'd better.

30:06.240 --> 30:09.159
I'll have the steak, please,
very well done.

30:09.160 --> 30:11.999
Er, right. Do you need a minute?
Yes, please. Jim?

30:12.000 --> 30:14.399
Erm, burger and chips, please.

30:14.400 --> 30:17.799
Girls?
Erm, garlic bread and chips.

30:17.800 --> 30:19.359
You need
to eat something proper, you.

30:19.360 --> 30:22.359
I'll have the salmon, please.
The burger. Thanks.

30:22.360 --> 30:23.399
I'll have the same.

30:23.400 --> 30:25.120
What? I'm hungry.

30:26.520 --> 30:27.639
What's up with your hair?

30:27.640 --> 30:29.240
I've been swimming.

30:30.680 --> 30:32.399
QUIETLY: After the police station?

30:32.400 --> 30:35.040
Yes.
So, what did they say?

30:36.080 --> 30:37.119
I didn't tell 'em.

30:37.120 --> 30:40.239
Can you be sure and tell the chef
very well done?

30:40.240 --> 30:42.480
SERVER: Of course I will, sir.
I think she's got it, Dad.

30:44.160 --> 30:47.000
I don't like blood on the plate.
OK.

30:48.480 --> 30:51.359
Right. I've spoken to the fella,

30:51.360 --> 30:55.239
and we can get her home on the
boat, not tomorrow, day after.

30:55.240 --> 30:58.199
And I'd already spoken
to t'funeral parlour at home.

30:58.200 --> 31:00.319
So, it's all sorted.
You didn't need to.

31:00.320 --> 31:02.240
Oh, I think I did.

31:07.360 --> 31:10.000
Dad, you know she wanted to be here.

31:11.080 --> 31:13.680
You do know that, don't you?
She's coming home.

31:14.720 --> 31:19.079
Whatever we think about
what she did here, she loved it.

31:19.080 --> 31:21.960
Oh, did she?
You know she did.

31:23.920 --> 31:26.399
What is everyone gonna say
if we leave her here?

31:26.400 --> 31:28.799
Who's everyone?
Who are you so worried about?

31:28.800 --> 31:30.639
Someone at the golf club?
Bloody hell, Dad.

31:30.640 --> 31:32.439
I'm worried about me.

31:32.440 --> 31:34.920
She cheated me out of the life
she promised me I'd have.

31:36.760 --> 31:39.640
And she's not gonna
make a fool of me in death.

31:58.320 --> 31:59.960
I'll go after him.

32:12.720 --> 32:14.160
All right?

32:16.440 --> 32:18.839
Used to be an internment camp here
during the war.

32:18.840 --> 32:20.519
All along t'front here.

32:20.520 --> 32:22.999
German artists
and musicians and whatnot.

32:23.000 --> 32:25.079
And a lot of 'em were Jewish.

32:25.080 --> 32:27.799
But the British Government
thought "Germans"

32:27.800 --> 32:29.719
and shipped 'em all
over here together.

32:29.720 --> 32:31.319
There's worse places
to be interned.

32:31.320 --> 32:32.999
There's better.

32:33.000 --> 32:36.120
Ah, yeah, Mary,
what about the Caymans?

32:38.960 --> 32:40.919
Sorry.

32:40.920 --> 32:44.519
Look, me and Bec have been having
a few bumps in the road lately.

32:44.520 --> 32:47.400
Well... you'll get there.

32:52.360 --> 32:54.640
Can you take me... there?

33:01.400 --> 33:03.200
Sure you want to do that?
I am.

34:28.680 --> 34:31.319
He's at the B&B with your dad.

34:31.320 --> 34:33.159
Why is dad at a B&B?

34:33.160 --> 34:36.520
Cos he is.
I'm calling him.

34:47.280 --> 34:48.760
Got a letter from Mum.

34:52.680 --> 34:54.039
What's it say?

34:54.040 --> 34:57.399
Don't know. I haven't... read it.

34:57.400 --> 34:59.560
It must have been with the post
that Jim brought.

35:01.440 --> 35:04.040

I want us to read it together.

35:10.360 --> 35:11.720

Are you coming to bed soon?

37:41.120 --> 37:43.400
Can I sleep with you?
It's a bit creaky. Come here.

38:00.960 --> 38:05.439
So, in the interest of
not keeping secrets any more,

38:05.440 --> 38:09.119
when you called me
to tell me about Mum,

38:09.120 --> 38:10.680
I was having a biopsy.

38:12.160 --> 38:14.120
I'm fine. It's fine.

38:15.640 --> 38:17.519
Results came back yesterday.

38:17.520 --> 38:19.999
You've been worrying about that
and not said anything?

38:20.000 --> 38:22.720
I wouldn't say worry.
More entering into denial.

38:24.240 --> 38:27.360
Anyway, it happened,
and I want to let you know.

38:37.680 --> 38:40.119
Where's Jim?

38:40.120 --> 38:41.600
He's gone to see the girls.

38:43.160 --> 38:44.320
Dad...

38:46.000 --> 38:47.560
Mum sent Becca a letter.

38:48.840 --> 38:50.680
She said she sent you a letter.

38:52.760 --> 38:54.520
What did it say?

38:55.600 --> 38:57.280
Did she tell you
she wanted to leave?

38:58.720 --> 39:01.800
Come here permanently,
be looked after here?

39:04.240 --> 39:06.400
We know she was happy here.

39:11.000 --> 39:13.320
We need to respect Mum's wishes.

39:16.200 --> 39:18.519
We're not gonna let her
leave the island.

39:18.520 --> 39:20.040
You'll do as you're told.

39:21.120 --> 39:22.760
We don't want to pretend any more.

39:26.000 --> 39:28.040
Who is pretending?

39:29.040 --> 39:30.080
Eh?

39:31.080 --> 39:32.799
Not me, that's for bloody sure.

39:32.800 --> 39:35.959
I'll tell you
what the letter said, shall I?

39:35.960 --> 39:38.119
It said, "Go be free."

39:38.120 --> 39:40.119
Free!

39:40.120 --> 39:43.399
Same bloody nonsense as when
she came home and did a big speech.

39:43.400 --> 39:45.519
You knew she had Alzheimer's?

39:45.520 --> 39:47.479
I knew she'd seen a doctor, yes.

39:47.480 --> 39:49.799
I knew she wasn't well,
but I thought she'd see sense.

39:49.800 --> 39:53.479
I married that woman for better
or worse so we'd grow old together.

39:53.480 --> 39:55.759
Not so she could come over here
and fly a kite.

39:55.760 --> 39:57.679
Dad...
I would've looked after her.

39:57.680 --> 40:00.560
She would've wanted for nothing.
But no. The grass were greener.

40:04.240 --> 40:05.559
So leave her here.

40:05.560 --> 40:07.639
That's what she was after.

40:07.640 --> 40:11.199
But let's get this straight -
it's not what I wanted.

40:11.200 --> 40:14.800
And don't you ever try
and fool yourselves that it was.

40:16.080 --> 40:17.719
I'm going home.
I'll sort myself out.

40:17.720 --> 40:19.120
Dad...

40:26.520 --> 40:28.039
Lauren, get it!

40:28.040 --> 40:29.919
And he hits it for a six!

40:29.920 --> 40:32.679
And that wins him the game!

40:32.680 --> 40:34.959
Mum, Dad's being a loser.

40:34.960 --> 40:37.199
Oh, your mum knows that,
all right.

40:37.200 --> 40:39.320
Girls, me and your dad
are gonna go for a walk.

40:52.040 --> 40:54.120
Erm, Mol said something
to me about...

40:55.680 --> 40:57.320
That made me think...

40:58.880 --> 41:01.679
..just with you telling her
what to do all the time

41:01.680 --> 41:04.479
was annoying her,
cos she's used to me doing it.

41:04.480 --> 41:07.559
Yep. Pretty surplus
to requirements.

41:07.560 --> 41:09.439
Well, that just isn't true.

41:09.440 --> 41:11.199
You said
you don't want to be with me.

41:11.200 --> 41:13.239
I didn't say that. I said...

41:13.240 --> 41:15.040
I said I didn't want this life.

41:16.320 --> 41:18.759
What's wrong with this life?

41:18.760 --> 41:21.639
Cos I'm just my mum
before she started all of this.

41:21.640 --> 41:23.879
You're really not your mum, Bec.

41:23.880 --> 41:25.759
I don't want to fade
into the background, Jim.

41:25.760 --> 41:28.320
I feel like I'm disappearing.
You just...

41:29.840 --> 41:33.519
Look at Rosaline.
She's so out in the world, and I...

41:33.520 --> 41:35.719
I'm just... I'm just a ghost.

41:35.720 --> 41:37.279
You're so not.

41:37.280 --> 41:39.639
You're in the middle
of everything. You run the show.

41:39.640 --> 41:41.600
Why does it always fall to me?

41:42.960 --> 41:44.199
Because you won't let me in.

41:44.200 --> 41:45.880
If I do anything,
it's not your way.

41:47.720 --> 41:49.840
I just got used to giving up.

41:58.040 --> 42:01.000
Just want us to be a team.
We are a team.

42:03.160 --> 42:05.440
I just need to be allowed
off the bench now and again.

42:11.320 --> 42:12.440
Bec...

42:16.280 --> 42:20.760
Some people spend a lifetime
trying to find someone like you.

42:22.720 --> 42:24.800
I struck gold first time.

42:29.120 --> 42:31.279
I don't even know
what I'm asking for.

42:31.280 --> 42:32.720
Try me.

42:40.840 --> 42:42.160
I want...

42:44.360 --> 42:46.359
I want us to grow together.

42:46.360 --> 42:47.760
Not apart.

42:49.880 --> 42:51.320
I just want us to talk.

42:52.600 --> 42:54.360
To not be kids.

42:56.760 --> 42:58.559
And I don't know
what all that looks like,

42:58.560 --> 43:00.599
and I don't even know
how we're gonna get there.

43:00.600 --> 43:02.440
Well, name it. I'll do it.

43:03.440 --> 43:05.080
No, you...

43:07.400 --> 43:09.680
..you have to help me
come up with a plan.

43:14.440 --> 43:15.959
I don't know what that is.

43:15.960 --> 43:19.440
I just...
know that I want it to be with you.

43:21.040 --> 43:22.520
Jim, that lad...

43:24.200 --> 43:26.079
It's fine.
It isn't.

43:26.080 --> 43:29.400
No. No, of course it's not... fine.

43:46.960 --> 43:49.519
PHONE RINGS

43:49.520 --> 43:51.320

43:59.880 --> 44:01.240
Hello.

44:03.640 --> 44:05.519
Oh, God.

44:05.520 --> 44:10.200
OK. Well, erm, don't kill her
if she gets there before I do.

44:11.840 --> 44:12.880
Yeah.

44:22.760 --> 44:25.439
The police came to see me.

44:25.440 --> 44:27.079
I didn't go to them in the end.

44:27.080 --> 44:28.760
Well, someone did.

44:30.080 --> 44:32.999
And what did you say to them?
The truth.

44:33.000 --> 44:35.959
The morphine was mine,
and your mother took it.

44:35.960 --> 44:38.439
I don't condone
what your mother did.

44:38.440 --> 44:41.399
But I agree
with her right to do it.

44:41.400 --> 44:45.439
But that does not mean
that I am guilty of helping her.

44:45.440 --> 44:48.159
If you hadn't had the morphine,
she'd still be alive.

44:48.160 --> 44:51.719
True. And that's why
the police are investigating it.

44:51.720 --> 44:54.919
I just need you to know...

44:54.920 --> 44:57.839
that I didn't harm your mother
in any way.

44:57.840 --> 45:00.000
And I never meant to harm her.

45:01.360 --> 45:04.240
I just wish we could have met
under different circumstances.

45:06.720 --> 45:08.200
Cathy...

45:10.000 --> 45:13.239
..I'll speak to the police.
Well, thank you.

45:13.240 --> 45:15.199
I'll tell them we realise

45:15.200 --> 45:18.359
you were just trying to be
a good friend to Mum.

45:18.360 --> 45:21.480
Well, whatever will be
will be, right?

45:41.200 --> 45:43.160
Here, puss, puss, puss! Puss!

45:44.280 --> 45:47.319
Looking for the cat. Here, puss!

45:47.320 --> 45:48.719
I put some food down for her,

45:48.720 --> 45:51.519
but, well,
what happens when we're gone?

45:51.520 --> 45:53.120
I can feed her.

45:54.320 --> 45:55.799
I'm gonna stay.

45:55.800 --> 45:57.839
Here?

45:57.840 --> 46:00.440
Yeah. If you don't mind.

46:01.920 --> 46:04.719
Well, I've seen a job advertised
I might go for.

46:04.720 --> 46:07.880
And, well, I can get the house
looking nice, rent it out.

46:08.880 --> 46:11.560
You bloody love your job.
I've seen you work Christmas Day.

46:13.680 --> 46:15.919
Not staying for that taxi driver,
are you?

46:15.920 --> 46:17.800
No! For me.

46:20.600 --> 46:22.560
Don't mind him
hanging around, though.

46:27.840 --> 46:29.679
I'll sort the funeral.

46:29.680 --> 46:31.160
Two weeks, they said.

46:34.400 --> 46:36.600
Hope Dad comes around.

46:38.360 --> 46:41.959
You two... be good.

46:41.960 --> 46:44.959
And if you can't be good,
be good at it.

46:44.960 --> 46:47.319
Oi! You can't say that
to a 16-year-old.

46:47.320 --> 46:49.000
She just did.

46:51.520 --> 46:53.720
Take care of yourself, Ros.
Bye.

47:01.080 --> 47:02.719
Right, well, I better head.

47:02.720 --> 47:04.999
Erm, I need
to say something to you.

47:05.000 --> 47:06.720
What?

47:07.880 --> 47:09.760
ROS EXHALES

47:11.120 --> 47:13.359
When you were born,

47:13.360 --> 47:15.479
I remember coming to the hospital,

47:15.480 --> 47:18.800
and Mum gave me a doll
cos she thought I'd be jealous.

47:20.240 --> 47:22.120
But I didn't want the doll.
I wanted you.

47:25.240 --> 47:27.159
Right.

47:27.160 --> 47:29.439
I was a big sister.

47:29.440 --> 47:32.520
Your big sister.
And that's all I wanted.

47:33.880 --> 47:36.360
And then when I got poorly,
that all changed.

47:40.720 --> 47:44.400
I don't know how we ended up
so far apart, because...

47:46.200 --> 47:47.439
..it's just us now, really.

47:47.440 --> 47:49.800
And I want you to know
that I love you.

47:51.760 --> 47:53.520
I love you, too.

47:55.280 --> 47:57.080
I love that you're my big sister.
