WEBVTT

00:05.715 --> 00:07.425
<i>It should come as no surprise</i>

00:07.508 --> 00:10.219
<i>that the very first grade
I ever received</i>

00:10.302 --> 00:11.971
<i>was a "super-duper."</i>

00:12.054 --> 00:14.598
<i>Granted it was for
counting spots on a ladybug,</i>

00:14.682 --> 00:16.726
<i>but still, I nailed it.</i>

00:16.809 --> 00:19.186
<i>Even as the difficulty
of assignments grew,</i>

00:19.270 --> 00:22.231
<i>I maintained the same level
of excellence.</i>

00:22.314 --> 00:23.774
Good job, Cooper.

00:24.442 --> 00:26.277
That's just sad, Cooper.

00:27.987 --> 00:30.406
<i>In every class, in every subject,</i>

00:30.489 --> 00:31.741
<i>I was perfect.</i>

00:31.824 --> 00:35.494
<i>Which is why this day hit me
like a ton of bricks.</i>

00:40.332 --> 00:41.834
Hey, moonpie.

00:41.917 --> 00:43.085
Ready to go?

00:43.169 --> 00:44.420
Look at this.

00:44.503 --> 00:46.797
95? That's terrific.

00:46.881 --> 00:49.091
No. If it was terrific,
it would say 100

00:49.175 --> 00:51.135
with the word "terrific"
next to it.

00:51.218 --> 00:53.554
Don't sweat it,
you'll get 100 next time.

00:53.637 --> 00:55.264
But I should have
gotten it this time.

00:55.347 --> 00:57.475
Dr. Sturgis made a mistake.

00:58.934 --> 01:00.519
And we're sweatin' it.

01:01.062 --> 01:04.647
Dr. Sturgis, I believe you've
made an error grading my test.

01:04.732 --> 01:06.859
Let me see.

01:07.693 --> 01:12.281
No, you didn't calculate
using Maxwell's equations.

01:12.364 --> 01:15.201
Maxwell's equation
my sweet patootie!

01:15.284 --> 01:16.994
You like Willie Nelson?

01:17.078 --> 01:19.038
That would require
knowing the permeability

01:19.121 --> 01:20.401
of free space and natural units.

01:20.456 --> 01:21.457
I suppose...

01:21.540 --> 01:23.417
I like Willie Nelson.

01:23.501 --> 01:26.087
...an electric field,
but that would still require...

01:26.170 --> 01:29.006
<i>♪♪ Nobody else
is stronger than I am ♪♪</i>

01:29.090 --> 01:31.842
<i>♪♪ Yesterday I moved a mountain ♪♪</i>

01:31.926 --> 01:34.470
<i>♪♪ I bet I could be your hero ♪♪</i>

01:34.553 --> 01:36.806

01:36.889 --> 01:41.352

01:47.024 --> 01:48.192
Morning, Peg.

01:48.275 --> 01:49.568
I need to run
Sunday's bulletin

01:49.652 --> 01:52.947
by Pastor Jeff. Is he in?

01:53.030 --> 01:54.698
Yep.

01:55.866 --> 01:57.159
Is he coming down
with somethin'?

01:57.243 --> 01:58.536
Yep.

02:01.497 --> 02:03.457
Oh, my, are you sick, too?

02:03.541 --> 02:06.085
Never better.

02:07.044 --> 02:08.336
Okay.

02:09.255 --> 02:10.256
Hello.

02:10.339 --> 02:12.383
Oh, hey, Mary, come on in.

02:12.466 --> 02:15.094
I... I'm fine here.

02:15.177 --> 02:17.179
Um, I have
Sunday's bulletin

02:17.263 --> 02:19.140
for your approval,
and I wanted to ask about

02:19.223 --> 02:21.308
ordering the palms
for Palm Sunday.

02:21.392 --> 02:23.853
I know it's early,
but as you remember last year,

02:23.936 --> 02:26.355
we waited too long
and First United Methodist

02:26.438 --> 02:27.638
snatched up all
the perky ones.

02:29.108 --> 02:30.109
Ooh.

02:30.192 --> 02:33.112
Should you be here right now?
You look terrible.

02:33.195 --> 02:34.321
I feel terrible.

02:34.405 --> 02:37.283
Well, then go home.
Let your wife take care of you.

02:37.366 --> 02:39.869
You'd think she'd do that,
but no.

02:39.952 --> 02:42.288
Ooh. Well, you should
at least go see a doctor.

02:42.371 --> 02:45.499
I can't. The Walker couple
is coming in for counseling.

02:45.583 --> 02:48.919
If you rescheduled,
I'm sure they'd understand.

02:49.962 --> 02:51.422
Hey, what if you did it?

02:52.131 --> 02:53.966
Marriage counseling?

02:54.049 --> 02:57.094
Don't you need some sort
of training for that?

02:57.178 --> 02:59.221
Nah, you just listen, uh,

02:59.305 --> 03:01.074
give 'em a couple prayers,
send 'em on their way.

03:01.098 --> 03:04.602
- Okay, if you really want me to.
- I do.

03:04.685 --> 03:08.647
In fact, for the rest
of the day, you're in charge.

03:08.731 --> 03:12.026
All right? The bulletins,
the palms, it's all you.

03:12.109 --> 03:14.320
Well, all right, um,

03:14.403 --> 03:16.822
but only if you promise
to go home and get some rest.

03:16.906 --> 03:22.119
Sure. Home, movie theater,
food court, somewhere.

03:27.499 --> 03:29.501
Today we're gonna work
on interior angles

03:29.585 --> 03:31.420
of a convex polygon.

03:31.503 --> 03:33.756
Georgie, where's your brother?

03:33.839 --> 03:36.091
I don't know.
Do you really want him here?

03:36.967 --> 03:39.178
Convex polygons are polygons...

03:40.471 --> 03:42.598
Sheldon, why aren't you
in second period?

03:42.681 --> 03:44.725
I'm working on
this math problem.

03:44.808 --> 03:47.019
I think you might be the
first person in history

03:47.102 --> 03:49.271
who's ever cut class
to do math.

03:49.355 --> 03:51.106
The irony wasn't lost on me.

03:51.190 --> 03:54.318
Oh, hey, 95. Good job.

03:54.401 --> 03:56.612
Really? I'm here every day

03:56.695 --> 03:58.215
and it's like
you don't know me at all.

03:58.697 --> 04:00.157
Oh, okay. Um...

04:00.866 --> 04:04.578
aw, 95, too bad.

04:04.662 --> 04:06.038
There we go.

04:11.418 --> 04:13.587
Anything you can tell
me about the Walkers?

04:13.671 --> 04:16.257
Not really,
just a couple of newlyweds

04:16.339 --> 04:17.800
trying to figure it out.

04:17.882 --> 04:19.677
Well, marriage is hard.

04:19.760 --> 04:21.762
- I'll never know.
- Oh...

04:21.845 --> 04:22.846
don't think that way.

04:22.930 --> 04:24.640
I'm sure there's someone
out there for you.

04:24.723 --> 04:26.350
Oh, no, that's not the problem.

04:26.433 --> 04:29.853
I just don't want to waste this
on just one guy.

04:29.937 --> 04:31.313
Sorry we're late.

04:31.397 --> 04:32.898
Someone couldn't decide
on a hat.

04:32.982 --> 04:34.775
- Sorry.
- Oh, that's all right.

04:34.858 --> 04:38.070
Hi, I'm Mary Cooper. I'm gonna
be doing your session today.

04:38.612 --> 04:40.614
Oh, what happened
to Pastor Jeff?

04:40.698 --> 04:43.117
He's out sick
and asked me to fill in.

04:43.200 --> 04:46.203
- Oh, okay.
- But don't worry,

04:46.287 --> 04:48.998
you're in good hands.
I've been married for 15 years

04:49.081 --> 04:50.401
and whatever
you're going through,

04:50.457 --> 04:52.334
I'm sure I've been through it
several times.

04:52.418 --> 04:53.419
Francine?

04:53.502 --> 04:56.588
I dig your hat.

04:56.672 --> 04:58.465
So when we
first started dating,

04:58.549 --> 05:00.884
he would plan these elaborate
picnics by the lake...

05:00.968 --> 05:03.929
you know, like a real picnic
with the red and white blanket.

05:04.013 --> 05:06.307
- Oh, gingham, sweetie, it's called gingham.
- Yeah.

05:06.890 --> 05:08.517
And after you got married,

05:08.600 --> 05:11.312
all the picnics
and wooing ended?

05:11.395 --> 05:12.604
No, no, not at all. No.

05:12.688 --> 05:14.523
In fact, Elliot's more dotin'
than ever.

05:14.606 --> 05:16.400
He knows that tulips
are my favorite,

05:16.483 --> 05:18.402
so every week there's
a fresh-cut bouquet

05:18.485 --> 05:19.611
on my nightstand.

05:19.695 --> 05:21.864
I own the flower shop
across from the post office.

05:21.947 --> 05:24.992
Well, y'all seem hunky-dory.

05:25.075 --> 05:26.910
I'm confused.
What's the issue?

05:27.661 --> 05:32.708
Well, um, we're having trouble
in the, you know...

05:33.792 --> 05:34.793
The bedroom.

05:35.794 --> 05:37.087
Oh.

05:37.838 --> 05:40.758
Sheldon, what are
you doing here?

05:41.550 --> 05:44.386
They wouldn't let me use the phone
in the principal's office.

05:44.470 --> 05:46.013
Who are you calling?

05:46.096 --> 05:48.640
Dr. Sturgis.
It's a math emergency.

05:48.724 --> 05:51.435
Don't you think you
should've asked my permission first?

05:51.518 --> 05:53.395
It's ringing. Yes or no?

05:54.730 --> 05:56.065
You know what? I don't care.

05:57.358 --> 05:58.525
<i>Hello?</i>

05:58.609 --> 06:02.237
Dr. Sturgis, this is Sheldon.
You're wrong and I can prove it.

06:03.113 --> 06:04.656
Is that so?

06:05.199 --> 06:06.784
It is so.

06:07.618 --> 06:11.455
All right, little man,
bring it on.

06:21.298 --> 06:23.509
Go ahead, Sheldon.
I'm all ears.

06:23.592 --> 06:25.636
Well, when I'm done,
you're going to be all tears.

06:25.719 --> 06:27.721
Okay, fellas,
let's keep it civil.

06:27.805 --> 06:30.682
You claim that the only way
to calculate the magnetic field

06:30.766 --> 06:33.560
in QCD units is using
Maxwell's equations,

06:33.644 --> 06:36.146
but you're completely
discrediting energy density.

06:36.230 --> 06:37.398
But you're still off.

06:37.481 --> 06:38.774
By a factor of 3.54.

06:38.857 --> 06:40.734
Which would seem
insignificant,

06:40.818 --> 06:42.236
but when examined closely,

06:42.319 --> 06:44.822
you realize that it's the
square root of four times pi.

06:44.905 --> 06:46.115
Your point being?

06:46.198 --> 06:48.450
Rationalized
and non-rationalized units

06:48.534 --> 06:50.160
differ by four times pi.

06:50.244 --> 06:52.037
Anyone with a basic knowledge
of electric

06:52.121 --> 06:53.664
and magnetic fields
would know that.

06:53.747 --> 06:55.666
I'm lost.
Are we still being civil?

06:55.749 --> 06:57.334
It's all right, Connie.

06:57.418 --> 07:00.003
Sheldon's trying to
justify his shortcut.

07:00.087 --> 07:01.130
Not a shortcut,

07:01.213 --> 07:02.840
a more elegant
and efficient method

07:02.923 --> 07:04.591
to achieve the correct answer.

07:05.134 --> 07:07.845
Well, I applaud the effort,
young man.

07:08.387 --> 07:11.348
Don't treat me like a child.
Treat me like a colleague.

07:12.015 --> 07:16.311
Fine. This is the stupidest
thing I've ever seen.

07:17.104 --> 07:20.732
How could you say that?!

07:20.816 --> 07:22.109
What are you doing?

07:22.192 --> 07:24.194
Treating him like a colleague.

07:24.278 --> 07:25.946
Do you and your colleagues
make each other

07:26.029 --> 07:28.031
run out of the room
crying like that?

07:28.615 --> 07:29.950
Sometimes.

07:30.033 --> 07:34.079
But we run slower,
'cause we're old.

07:36.331 --> 07:39.001
And then he said,
"For the rest of the day,

07:39.084 --> 07:40.794
- you're in charge."
- Mm.

07:40.878 --> 07:43.130
Those were his exact words.
Can you believe it?

07:43.213 --> 07:44.715
"You're in charge."

07:44.798 --> 07:46.276
- Well, that's great.
- And thanks to me,

07:46.300 --> 07:49.219
this year United Methodist
is gonna get stuck

07:49.303 --> 07:50.721
with all the limp palms.

07:51.430 --> 07:53.640
Well, I don't know what
that means, but good for you.

07:53.724 --> 07:54.909
I even did some
marriage counseling

07:54.933 --> 07:56.477
for a couple of young newlyweds.

07:56.560 --> 07:58.437
Ooh, what kind of trouble
they having?

07:58.520 --> 08:01.023
Oh, it's all confidential.
I really can't say.

08:01.106 --> 08:02.441
Well, I don't
need specifics,

08:02.524 --> 08:04.318
just, you know, general terms.

08:06.069 --> 08:07.362
They're having sexual problems.

08:07.446 --> 08:08.447
Really?

08:08.530 --> 08:10.199
Newlyweds?

08:10.282 --> 08:11.408
But we all prayed on it

08:11.492 --> 08:13.660
and then the answer came
clear as a bell.

08:13.744 --> 08:14.912
Yeah?

08:14.995 --> 08:17.831
The husband is under
a lot of stress at work

08:17.915 --> 08:20.542
and it's diminishing
his natural desires.

08:20.626 --> 08:22.586
Huh. What kind of work
does he do

08:22.669 --> 08:24.087
he's got so much stress?

08:24.171 --> 08:27.508
He owns that flower shop
across from the post office.

08:28.175 --> 08:30.677
Flower shop. Huh.

08:30.761 --> 08:33.096
You've seen it.
It's called The Pretty Petunia.

08:35.057 --> 08:36.475
Huh.

08:45.609 --> 08:46.652
So, Sheldon,

08:46.735 --> 08:49.530
you and Dr. Sturgis figure out
your math emergency?

08:49.613 --> 08:51.615
I'd rather not talk about it.

08:51.698 --> 08:53.200
Me neither.

08:55.160 --> 08:56.703
That's probably for me.

08:56.787 --> 08:59.039
I'm really getting popular.

08:59.122 --> 09:00.624
What's a math emergency?

09:00.707 --> 09:03.627
That's when things don't add up.

09:03.710 --> 09:04.836
<i>Hello?</i>

09:05.379 --> 09:06.898
Oh, come on, guys,
that was a good one.

09:06.922 --> 09:09.091
<i>Mom, it's Pastor Jeff!</i>

09:09.174 --> 09:10.759
Mm, excuse me.

09:10.842 --> 09:12.719
To answer your question,
Georgie,

09:12.803 --> 09:14.596
it's when a scientist
is too immature

09:14.680 --> 09:16.139
to admit when he's wrong.

09:17.015 --> 09:18.517
Maybe you're too immature.

09:18.600 --> 09:20.894
Gentlemen, please.

09:20.978 --> 09:23.897
I'm sorry, but when someone
with way less experience

09:23.981 --> 09:25.566
accuses me of not knowing

09:25.649 --> 09:28.652
what I'm talking about,
my hackles are up.

09:28.735 --> 09:30.028
What's a hackle?

09:30.112 --> 09:31.589
Well, if he's wrong,
then teach him to be right

09:31.613 --> 09:34.032
instead of berating him
like a big ol' jackass.

09:34.116 --> 09:36.243
That's very hurtful!

09:43.000 --> 09:45.669
Well, how 'bout that?

09:45.752 --> 09:47.421
They do run slower.

09:47.504 --> 09:51.091
Good news!
I get to go visit a shut-in.

09:51.633 --> 09:53.844
What the hell is going on today?

10:00.892 --> 10:02.477
<i>It's open.</i>

10:03.645 --> 10:04.938
<i>What's up, Schultz?</i>

10:05.022 --> 10:07.107
<i>Are you asking me?</i>

10:07.190 --> 10:09.651
<i>Haven't you learned that I know
nothing, I see nothing...</i>

10:09.735 --> 10:12.279
Hello? Mr. Gilford?

10:12.821 --> 10:14.031
Who are you?

10:15.741 --> 10:18.160
Hi, I'm Mary Cooper
from the church.

10:18.243 --> 10:19.620
Pastor Jeff is out sick,

10:19.703 --> 10:21.622
so he asked me
to bring over your dinner.

10:22.331 --> 10:25.250
- Steak fingers?
- With extra gravy.

10:25.876 --> 10:27.419
Where's my Mr. Pibb?

10:27.502 --> 10:30.297
Oh, right here.

10:30.964 --> 10:32.174
You want me to
open it for you?

10:32.257 --> 10:33.884
I've got hands.

10:34.968 --> 10:37.179
Maybe while you eat
we could chat a little.

10:37.262 --> 10:40.557
I'm old, I'm alone,
I'm gonna die soon.

10:40.641 --> 10:42.809
There, we've chatted.

10:42.893 --> 10:44.061
Okay.

10:44.895 --> 10:46.980
If you're not in the mood
for conversation,

10:47.064 --> 10:49.149
maybe there's something else
I could do for you.

10:50.567 --> 10:53.236
Haven't had a sponge bath
in a while.

10:54.571 --> 10:57.449
Does Pastor Jeff
give you a sponge bath?

10:57.532 --> 10:58.909
Sure does.

11:00.369 --> 11:01.495
Mr. Gilford.

11:02.371 --> 11:03.664
No.

11:08.710 --> 11:10.962
- Lights out?
- In a minute.

11:12.130 --> 11:15.008
I may not understand
exactly what's going on

11:15.092 --> 11:18.011
with you and Dr. Sturgis,
but you can't be rude to an adult.

11:18.095 --> 11:19.471
What if they're wrong?

11:19.554 --> 11:22.034
Doesn't matter. There are plenty
of stupid people in the world,

11:22.099 --> 11:25.102
but when they're older than you,
you got to show them respect.

11:27.104 --> 11:31.066
I understand, sir. Thank you
for your incredibly wise advice.

11:32.317 --> 11:33.610
Okay.

11:39.408 --> 11:42.077
Did you just call Dad stupid
without calling him stupid?

11:42.160 --> 11:43.537
Yes.

11:53.588 --> 11:55.465
Here, let me get that.

11:55.549 --> 11:58.218
And, uh, while
I'm cleaning up,

11:58.301 --> 12:00.721
I could also tackle
some of, um...

12:00.804 --> 12:03.640
Don't touch anything!
I like it the way it is.

12:03.724 --> 12:06.685
Could I at least open a window,
get you some fresh air?

12:06.768 --> 12:10.439
It's not necessary.
I've got some right here.

12:13.900 --> 12:15.819
Mind if I make some room to sit?

12:15.902 --> 12:17.696
You're staying?

12:17.779 --> 12:20.532
Yes, I'm staying. I'm here
to keep you company.

12:20.615 --> 12:23.994
Why? So you'll look like
some kind of Good Samaritan?

12:24.077 --> 12:27.539
Because God calls on us
to serve our fellow man.

12:27.622 --> 12:30.917
Romans 12:13, "Share with
the Lord's people who are..."

12:31.001 --> 12:32.627
What are you doing?

12:32.711 --> 12:34.004
Quoting scripture.

12:34.087 --> 12:36.173
Well, I don't want to hear that.

12:36.256 --> 12:37.549
You don't want
to hear the Bible?

12:37.632 --> 12:39.092
Not from some woman.

12:39.718 --> 12:41.928
- Excuse me?
- Where have you been?

12:42.012 --> 12:43.889
Women don't preach
in our church.

12:43.972 --> 12:47.142
Well, I'm not in our church,
I'm in your living room,

12:47.225 --> 12:49.561
which is, by the way,
disgusting.

12:56.109 --> 12:58.111
I'm sorry I called
you a jackass.

12:58.195 --> 13:02.991
A "big old jackass."

13:03.074 --> 13:05.786
But it's okay. I deserved it.

13:05.869 --> 13:08.079
Don't be too hard
on yourself.

13:08.163 --> 13:10.832
Sheldon's always been
difficult to deal with.

13:10.916 --> 13:13.794
I'm not upset
that he's difficult.

13:14.252 --> 13:16.546
I'm upset that he's right.

13:17.172 --> 13:19.257
Really?

13:19.341 --> 13:21.551
And you're just now
saying something?

13:21.635 --> 13:25.680
Energy density, rationalized
and non-rationalized units,

13:25.764 --> 13:27.557
I can't believe I missed it.

13:27.641 --> 13:30.977
Well, like you said,
everybody makes a mistake.

13:31.061 --> 13:33.230
But it was so obvious.

13:33.313 --> 13:36.316
A younger me would've seen it.

13:36.399 --> 13:38.944
I think I'm losing a step.

13:39.027 --> 13:40.695
You're not alone.

13:40.779 --> 13:43.865
The other night I had bingo for
five moves, didn't even know it.

13:43.949 --> 13:46.618
Were you drinking?

13:46.701 --> 13:49.079
It's bingo,
of course I was drinking.

13:50.705 --> 13:52.374
Don't worry about it.

13:52.916 --> 13:55.794
We'll lose a step together.

13:58.713 --> 14:00.215
Thank you, Bonnie.

14:01.466 --> 14:04.803
You see that?
I made a joke about it.

14:04.886 --> 14:08.473
- Never do it again.
- Yes, ma'am.

14:13.103 --> 14:15.146
- Hey, Sheldon.
- Hello.

14:15.230 --> 14:17.232
You get that test problem
sorted out?

14:17.315 --> 14:21.486
No, I'm afraid Dr. Sturgis and I
are still at a math impasse.

14:21.570 --> 14:24.322
- Oh, I hate those.
- Thank you for asking.

14:24.406 --> 14:27.576
I appreciate it.
And how are you doing?

14:28.493 --> 14:30.120
Since when are you interested?

14:30.203 --> 14:32.831
My father told me I should be
kind to old people.

14:33.790 --> 14:35.792
How old do you think I am?

14:36.835 --> 14:39.421
My father also told me
if a woman ever asks you that,

14:39.504 --> 14:40.589
it's a trap.

14:40.672 --> 14:42.674
Hmm. Smart man.

14:43.300 --> 14:45.343
But I'll say 53.

14:55.020 --> 14:57.772
Peg, we got any more of those
fancy binder clips?

14:57.856 --> 14:59.316
Bottom right drawer.

15:00.233 --> 15:03.069
Oh! Um, hi.

15:03.153 --> 15:04.529
Y...

15:04.613 --> 15:06.781
You're back. Uh, feeling better?

15:06.865 --> 15:08.325
No.

15:08.408 --> 15:10.702
Then what are you doing here?
Why aren't you home in bed?

15:10.785 --> 15:13.246
Because not everybody has
a happy marriage, Mary, okay?

15:14.080 --> 15:15.332
Sorry.

15:16.666 --> 15:18.126
How's everything
going around here?

15:18.209 --> 15:21.546
Really well. I had a lovely
session with the Walkers.

15:21.630 --> 15:25.175
I think that they're gonna be
fruitful and multiplying soon.

15:25.258 --> 15:27.010
And, um,

15:27.093 --> 15:31.473
I had a visit with our shut-in,
Mr. Gilford.

15:31.556 --> 15:33.099
He's quite the character,
isn't he?

15:33.183 --> 15:35.852
- That's a nice way to put it.
- Yeah, well, you got to

15:35.936 --> 15:37.938
give him a pass,
what with all he's been through.

15:38.021 --> 15:39.689
What's he been through?

15:39.773 --> 15:42.609
Mary, that man sitting all alone
in that mess of a house

15:42.692 --> 15:45.111
is a genuine war hero.

15:45.195 --> 15:47.906
People like you and me'll never
understand what he went through.

15:48.990 --> 15:50.283
I didn't know.

15:50.367 --> 15:53.495
Well, he sure won't talk about it.
He give you a hard time?

15:53.578 --> 15:57.457
Yeah, and... and I kind of
gave him one right back.

15:59.334 --> 16:01.127
Would you mind if I
went back over there

16:01.211 --> 16:02.712
and gave it another go?

16:02.796 --> 16:06.132
By all means. I got to lay down.

16:06.216 --> 16:08.677
Hey, Peg, if my wife
calls, tell her...

16:08.760 --> 16:11.638
You know what, oh,
she's not gonna call.

16:11.721 --> 16:12.889
Never mind.

16:23.984 --> 16:27.153
Mr. Gilford,
it's Mary Cooper again.

16:33.118 --> 16:35.620
Mr. Gilford?

16:37.831 --> 16:40.208
Mr. Gilford?

16:48.258 --> 16:50.135
- You a relative?
- No.

16:50.218 --> 16:51.678
Friend?

16:51.761 --> 16:53.680
I was trying.

16:53.763 --> 16:57.475
Okay, well, sorry.
Coroner's on his way.

16:57.559 --> 16:59.060
Thank you.

16:59.853 --> 17:01.479
This is some mess, huh?

17:02.272 --> 17:04.898
It's how he liked it.

17:16.368 --> 17:17.454
May I come in?

17:18.579 --> 17:19.830
I guess.

17:24.877 --> 17:28.506
I looked over your
work again and, uh,

17:28.590 --> 17:30.800
the math was correct.

17:34.262 --> 17:35.388
Really?

17:35.472 --> 17:37.390
You were right...

17:37.474 --> 17:41.227
and I was, uh, wrong.

17:41.311 --> 17:43.063
Sorry I doubted you.

17:43.646 --> 17:47.067
Wow. It must be really hard
for you to admit that.

17:47.150 --> 17:48.568
Well, yes.

17:49.444 --> 17:53.281
But, uh, I thought it could be
a learning opportunity for you.

17:53.364 --> 17:54.783
What do you mean?

17:54.866 --> 17:56.409
I wanted to show you
that being wrong

17:56.493 --> 17:58.536
is not the end of the world.

17:59.079 --> 18:02.207
Oh, okay. Thank you.

18:02.290 --> 18:04.918
<i>Dr. Sturgis was a wise man.</i>

18:05.001 --> 18:07.170
<i>It was a learning opportunity.</i>

18:07.253 --> 18:09.798
<i>And when the day comes
that I'm wrong,</i>

18:09.881 --> 18:11.883
<i>I fully plan to admit it.</i>

18:16.304 --> 18:19.808
Okay, before we finish up,
I'd like to call up Mary Cooper,

18:19.891 --> 18:21.935
who has a few words
she'd like to say.

18:28.066 --> 18:29.484
Thank you, Pastor Jeff.

18:31.861 --> 18:33.738
As some of you might know,

18:33.822 --> 18:36.324
we lost a member
of our congregation.

18:36.407 --> 18:39.285
James Gilford passed away
earlier this week.

18:39.953 --> 18:41.371
If that name isn't
familiar to you,

18:41.454 --> 18:44.457
don't feel bad,
it wasn't to me either.

18:44.541 --> 18:46.084
But in the last few days,

18:46.167 --> 18:48.461
I've gotten to learn
a little bit about him.

18:48.545 --> 18:53.049
He was married to his wife
Meredith for over 45 years,

18:53.133 --> 18:55.301
he was a lieutenant in the Army,

18:55.385 --> 18:57.554
and, forgive him for this,

18:57.637 --> 18:59.848
a big fan of the Dallas Cowboys.

19:01.516 --> 19:05.145
But even if you didn't know him,
I hope that you'll still join me

19:05.228 --> 19:07.480
in celebrating his life
this Wednesday

19:07.564 --> 19:10.358
at the American Legion.
Thank you.

19:10.441 --> 19:14.320
Oh, um, and if there's
anyone who's able

19:14.404 --> 19:16.990
to help me clean out his house,
please let me know.

19:17.073 --> 19:20.743
Ooh, you know I love to tackle
clutter. We'll do it!

19:20.827 --> 19:23.621
Oh, thank you.
