WEBVTT

00:02.973 --> 00:03.674
MAN:
Honey, I'm sorry,

00:03.941 --> 00:06.547
but there is no way
I can make it by 7:00.

00:06.614 --> 00:09.185
Just eat without me.

00:09.252 --> 00:10.622
Yes, I realize
it's your parents.

00:10.688 --> 00:13.393
Tell your dad to order
the most expensive cab.

00:13.460 --> 00:15.197
He's good at that.

00:15.264 --> 00:17.636
Oh...

00:19.238 --> 00:21.610
No, you did not order any...

00:21.710 --> 00:23.113
(groans)

00:23.146 --> 00:26.486
...sarcasm, honey,
but you realize

00:26.587 --> 00:28.456
what time of year it is.

00:28.558 --> 00:31.964
All of my clients waited
until the last minute

00:32.031 --> 00:34.770
to file their taxes, again.

00:34.870 --> 00:38.176
Of course I want to see
your parents.

00:38.276 --> 00:40.682
Well, maybe the problem is
you insist on

00:40.782 --> 00:45.324
inviting them to town
every year around tax day,

00:45.424 --> 00:47.629
like you're testing me
or something.

00:47.696 --> 00:51.369
Yes, it's true, you've been
doing it for 11 years.

00:51.436 --> 00:53.039
Of course
I'm keeping the receipts.

00:53.139 --> 00:55.578
That's literally my job.

00:58.049 --> 00:59.252
What do you want me to say?

00:59.318 --> 01:00.555
"Oh, I'm so sorry,
Mr. and Mrs. Stewart.

01:00.688 --> 01:02.859
"My in-laws are in town,
so I won't have time

01:02.926 --> 01:04.262
to finish your returns?"

01:04.328 --> 01:06.032
I am not burning my practice
to the ground

01:06.099 --> 01:09.706
after all the work
I've put into building it.

01:09.773 --> 01:10.808
(sighs)

01:10.909 --> 01:14.015
Yes, I'll try to get there
for dessert.

01:14.115 --> 01:16.119
Love you.

01:18.023 --> 01:20.561
Oh, my God!

01:25.037 --> 01:28.076
(crying out)

01:34.589 --> 01:36.794
Dispatch said a man
broke in after hours,

01:36.860 --> 01:38.296
tried to burn
the office down.

01:38.330 --> 01:39.933
LAPD's on their way,
but caller said

01:40.000 --> 01:41.269
the victim is no longer
a threat.

01:41.336 --> 01:43.841
Oh.
And all those banker's boxes

01:43.941 --> 01:46.145
equal more than
a few matchboxes.

01:46.179 --> 01:48.918
Many unhappy returns.

01:48.985 --> 01:50.622
Why didn't the sprinklers
go off?

01:50.722 --> 01:52.559
Somebody's quick on their feet;
avoided some serious damage.

01:52.626 --> 01:54.963
I tried to move him,
but his skin fell off.

01:55.030 --> 01:56.132
I didn't know what to do.

01:56.199 --> 01:57.301
BOBBY:
Well, you did your part by

01:57.401 --> 01:58.436
putting out the fire.

01:58.504 --> 01:59.706
I tell you what,
let's step aside,

01:59.773 --> 02:01.109
let my team finish from here.

02:01.209 --> 02:02.912
Buck, check for hot spots.

02:02.979 --> 02:04.683
-Chim, you're with me.
-Copy that.

02:08.524 --> 02:10.762
-Pulse is weak.
-Breathing shallow.

02:10.862 --> 02:14.335
Sir, can you hear me?
Can you tell me your name?

02:14.402 --> 02:16.472
No response.
Probably burn shock.

02:16.540 --> 02:19.713
EDDIE:
I'll start him on oxygen.

02:22.852 --> 02:26.225
Pulse ox is good.
No signs of smoke inhalation.

02:26.326 --> 02:27.729
All right.
So I can take this off?

02:27.796 --> 02:29.298
Not unless you want to go
to the hospital, too.

02:29.365 --> 02:31.503
Okay, office is clear.
I found this.

02:31.570 --> 02:33.273
Looks like it belongs
to the perp.

02:34.308 --> 02:36.880
Mason Lewis.
You know this guy?

02:41.089 --> 02:44.061
He's a client
who's being audited.

02:44.128 --> 02:45.130
(cries out in pain)

02:45.263 --> 02:46.533
It's-it's gonna be okay.

02:46.600 --> 02:48.136
We're gonna get you out of here.

02:48.269 --> 02:50.942
Foil blanket,
then let's get him on a gurney.

02:51.009 --> 02:54.649
Dispatch, this is Captain Nash,
118. We're wrapping up here.

02:54.716 --> 02:56.486
Please alert
L. A. General Burn Center

02:56.553 --> 02:58.657
-we are nine minutes out.
-He's good, Cap.

02:58.791 --> 03:01.329
Hey, listen, if you experience
any dizziness

03:01.396 --> 03:03.166
or lightheadedness,
get yourself to an ER.

03:03.266 --> 03:04.503
Not today, I won't.

03:04.569 --> 03:06.139
I still have piles
of returns to go through

03:06.205 --> 03:08.276
to see what I can salvage.

03:08.376 --> 03:09.679
Well, it's like they say, Cap:

03:09.746 --> 03:11.617
only two things in this life
are inevitable.

03:11.683 --> 03:13.521
Death and taxes.

03:13.587 --> 03:16.827
Well, and sometimes
they go together.

03:32.792 --> 03:35.464
Dispatch, this is 727-L-30

03:35.497 --> 03:37.669
arriving at 3124 Glen Drive

03:37.736 --> 03:39.906
to provide assistance
in arrest warrant.

03:40.040 --> 03:42.612
DISPATCH:
Copy, 727-L-30.

03:42.712 --> 03:47.020
-So, who's today's
lucky contestant?
-Dominic Dawson.

03:47.087 --> 03:49.125
47-year-old male wanted
for defrauding

03:49.225 --> 03:50.427
a homeless charity.

03:50.494 --> 03:54.001
Dominic Dawson of
Dawson Dream It foundation?

03:54.068 --> 03:56.105
Got caught buying a yacht
with the organization's money.

03:56.172 --> 03:57.942
They're saying he's
a potential flight risk.

03:58.009 --> 04:00.080
ATHENA:
He's in there now.

04:00.180 --> 04:01.583
Mm. Second floor.

04:01.650 --> 04:04.355
So let's stop talking about it.

04:11.169 --> 04:13.808
Police. Open up.

04:16.780 --> 04:19.385
Open up! Police!

04:29.071 --> 04:31.309
♪ ♪

04:57.996 --> 05:00.033
(clatter)

05:05.043 --> 05:08.349
ANTHENA: Suspect in bathroom.
Battering ram needed.

05:11.322 --> 05:14.461
(rummaging, soft clattering)

05:21.810 --> 05:24.381
(soft clatter)

05:25.250 --> 05:28.724
Police. Come out
with your hands up.

05:32.464 --> 05:35.337
Open up the door, now.

05:42.652 --> 05:45.090
-MAN: Don't shoot.
I'll be right out.
-(toilet flushing)

05:55.578 --> 05:56.780
Really?

05:56.914 --> 05:58.784
I'd give it a minute.

06:08.837 --> 06:11.042
(sighs)

06:13.012 --> 06:15.450
DOMINIC: Yo, there sure were
a lot of new people

06:15.518 --> 06:16.553
showing up back there.

06:16.620 --> 06:17.789
ATHENA:
Evidence division.

06:17.855 --> 06:19.559
We didn't just serve
an arrest warrant.

06:19.593 --> 06:21.462
A search warrant came with it.

06:21.530 --> 06:23.032
Almost always does.

06:23.099 --> 06:25.871
I would think a man such as
yourself would know that.

06:25.938 --> 06:28.443
You mean a thief
such as myself, right?

06:28.510 --> 06:30.247
You know, last time I checked

06:30.347 --> 06:32.484
I was innocent
till proven guilty.

06:32.552 --> 06:34.956
Is that why you're asking
so many innocent questions?

06:35.056 --> 06:37.294
-I just don't like having
people in my house.
-Oh, well,

06:37.361 --> 06:38.998
they should only be there

06:39.064 --> 06:42.337
two, maybe three days at most.

06:42.404 --> 06:43.707
Sooner if you tell us
where you're hiding

06:43.774 --> 06:46.212
all that money you embezzled.

06:46.312 --> 06:48.550
(groaning)

06:50.922 --> 06:54.428
Sir. Dominic!

06:57.535 --> 06:59.639
Dispatch, this is 727-L-30.

06:59.706 --> 07:01.510
I need an RA unit
and backup unit

07:01.576 --> 07:03.413
at Temple and Alameda, now.

07:03.479 --> 07:04.883
Suspect is unconscious.

07:04.983 --> 07:07.956
MADDIE: Copy that
loud and clear, 727-L-30.

07:08.022 --> 07:10.895
Temple and Alameda.
I've located an available unit.

07:10.962 --> 07:13.534
The 133 is en route.
They're two minutes out.

07:13.634 --> 07:16.172
Is the suspect breathing?

07:16.272 --> 07:17.542
Barely.

07:17.675 --> 07:21.215
Dominic? Dominic,
can you hear me?

07:21.282 --> 07:23.988
Dominic!

07:26.258 --> 07:28.162
MADDIE:
Can you check for a pulse?

07:30.066 --> 07:32.872
No carotid pulse.
Starting chest compressions.

07:32.939 --> 07:34.743
(siren approaching)

07:34.809 --> 07:38.449
Stay with me, Dominic.
Help is almost here.

07:40.554 --> 07:42.592
(sirens approaching)

07:49.204 --> 07:51.075
(exhales)

07:54.415 --> 07:56.820
(indistinct radio chatter)

07:57.421 --> 07:58.991
PARAMEDIC:
Let's go.

08:03.066 --> 08:06.105
Okay, got nothing.
We got this, Officer.

08:08.844 --> 08:12.250
-Sergeant, what happened?
-I don't know.

08:13.486 --> 08:14.889
He just collapsed.

08:14.989 --> 08:16.626
PARAMEDIC:
Okay, we got a pulse.
Let's move him.

08:16.693 --> 08:18.764
All right, escort them to
the hospital and stay with him.

08:18.864 --> 08:21.002
Wherever he goes, you go.

08:21.068 --> 08:22.805
-Got it?
-Roger.

08:26.178 --> 08:28.016
LIEUTENANT:
And you're certain there was

08:28.116 --> 08:32.424
no altercation of any kind
upon arrest?

08:32.457 --> 08:34.829
Sergeant Grant?

08:35.598 --> 08:36.733
Did he resist?

08:36.833 --> 08:40.073
(exhales sharply)
He gave himself up.

08:40.140 --> 08:41.576
I put him in the car.

08:41.643 --> 08:45.216
Did he seem nervous?
Panicky?

08:45.316 --> 08:46.252
Not at all.

08:46.352 --> 08:47.955
One minute,
he's chatting me up,

08:48.022 --> 08:51.062
the next minute,
he's down for the count.

08:51.162 --> 08:53.332
Well, it sounds like you did
everything by the book, so

08:53.399 --> 08:55.336
now it's just about
the paperwork,

08:55.470 --> 08:56.773
and that won't be too bad.

08:56.807 --> 08:58.977
He had a pulse
when they took him away.

08:59.078 --> 09:01.015
MAYNARD:
Not anymore.

09:04.254 --> 09:06.492
We just got word
from the hospital.

09:06.560 --> 09:08.530
Dominic Dawson is dead.

09:09.933 --> 09:11.302
(sighs)

09:17.515 --> 09:20.186
Remember that big math test?
I aced it.

09:20.253 --> 09:23.326
-Hmm.
-But science is still
my favorite subject.

09:23.392 --> 09:25.931
We made s'mores
with solar ovens.

09:25.998 --> 09:29.672
Now we can make s'mores
every night, like we used to.

09:29.739 --> 09:32.043
No, not every night.

09:33.012 --> 09:33.947
Why not?

09:34.047 --> 09:36.385
Well, funny thing
about solar ovens,

09:36.485 --> 09:38.489
they don't work at night.

09:38.557 --> 09:40.260
Dad, you know what I mean.

09:41.596 --> 09:44.602
I still miss
making s'mores with you, Mom.

09:44.669 --> 09:48.242
I'm sure she misses making them
with you, too, bud.

09:49.111 --> 09:51.983
Dad, do you think she can
hear us when we talk to her?

09:52.050 --> 09:54.522
Absolutely.

09:54.589 --> 09:56.325
That's why we come here.

09:57.394 --> 10:00.133
I wish I could hear her
talk back.

10:03.005 --> 10:04.576
Me, too, bud.

10:06.445 --> 10:08.951
Me, too.

10:10.086 --> 10:12.592
Hey, do you want to go
to the store on the way back?

10:12.692 --> 10:16.700
We can pick up some stuff
to make some s'mores.

10:19.772 --> 10:22.712
Can we make an extra one
for Mom?

10:25.450 --> 10:27.755
Always.

10:33.166 --> 10:35.069
They're not suggesting you had
anything to do with it?

10:35.170 --> 10:38.677
Of course not, but that
doesn't change the fact that

10:38.744 --> 10:41.616
-he collapsed in the back
of my patrol car.
-Right.

10:41.716 --> 10:43.954
-He was under my supervision.
-But, Athena,

10:44.021 --> 10:45.658
I don't think there's anything
you or anyone

10:45.758 --> 10:46.893
could have done
to prevent it.

10:46.960 --> 10:51.335
I just keep replaying it
over in my head.

10:51.435 --> 10:53.406
Yeah.

10:54.642 --> 10:56.178
I know you want
to find an answer, but this

10:56.278 --> 10:57.882
might be a case
where there isn't one.

10:57.982 --> 10:59.886
The man could have just died,

10:59.986 --> 11:01.523
and there's no rhyme
or reason to it.

11:01.623 --> 11:05.096
There is always a reason.

11:12.845 --> 11:15.149
Whoa, that is a lot
of ice cream.

11:15.216 --> 11:17.187
Is Jee having a party
that I don't know about?

11:17.254 --> 11:19.592
Broken freezer at
the grocery store equals

11:19.659 --> 11:21.228
50% off of ice cream.

11:21.295 --> 11:23.834
An offer that would be
criminal to refuse.

11:23.934 --> 11:24.969
-We're never gonna eat all that.
-Mmm.

11:25.069 --> 11:26.438
Well, think about
how much I saved.

11:26.573 --> 11:30.246
A year's worth of ice cream
for the price of six months.

11:30.313 --> 11:31.983
And there's no such thing
as too much ice cream.

11:32.050 --> 11:34.756
Here, try this.
Dulce de deliciousness.

11:34.822 --> 11:35.991
-Oh, my God.
-Right?

11:36.058 --> 11:37.494
It's like you can taste
the cinnamon.

11:37.595 --> 11:40.868
No. Oh, my God, this.
It's from the IRS.

11:40.935 --> 11:42.572
Okay, so open it.

11:42.672 --> 11:44.341
Nothing good ever comes
from the IRS.

11:44.441 --> 11:47.480
(sighs) Not opening it doesn't
change the fact that you got it.

11:47.548 --> 11:48.584
May I?

11:48.717 --> 11:51.656
They're probably just trying
to verify your new address

11:51.723 --> 11:54.228
or something.

11:55.531 --> 11:57.200
-Or not. You're being audited.
-What?

11:57.300 --> 11:58.837
How is that possible?

11:58.971 --> 12:00.173
It's probably just
some random audit.

12:00.240 --> 12:02.511
They do these things
all the time.

12:02.612 --> 12:06.118
It's not the end of the world.
Everything's gonna be fine.

12:07.521 --> 12:08.857
Hey.

12:08.924 --> 12:12.898
This is another letter
from the IRS addressed to me.

12:19.144 --> 12:20.681
MADDIE:
They want to meet
with us together.

12:20.748 --> 12:23.219
In person.

12:26.091 --> 12:28.964
I don't get it. Something
must have triggered it.

12:29.031 --> 12:30.968
Maybe it's the loan
we got from your parents.

12:31.035 --> 12:32.538
I knew we should have
never taken that money.

12:32.638 --> 12:35.009
Uh, that's not what you said
when we deposited the check.

12:35.143 --> 12:37.581
What about the donation we gave
during the move?

12:37.615 --> 12:40.219
All tax-deductible
and totally legit.

12:40.320 --> 12:41.355
Look, you're spiraling.

12:41.422 --> 12:42.959
We both are, and I don't know

12:43.025 --> 12:44.261
what we're freaking out about

12:44.294 --> 12:45.798
because, obviously,
it was a simple mistake.

12:45.898 --> 12:47.735
You know, it's not like
we intentionally meant

12:47.835 --> 12:48.704
to do something wrong.

12:48.837 --> 12:49.973
Maddie, it's the IRS;

12:50.039 --> 12:51.743
they don't care about
intentions.

12:51.843 --> 12:54.414
-Ice cream.
-Oh, great.

12:54.481 --> 12:56.485
You're supposed to be in bed.

12:56.586 --> 12:57.487
(Maddie chuckles)

12:57.622 --> 12:59.324
Ice cream.

12:59.424 --> 13:00.961
Might as well let her eat some.

13:01.028 --> 13:02.263
Could be the last time

13:02.364 --> 13:04.001
we have a late-night snack
with our daughter

13:04.067 --> 13:05.638
-before they haul us
off to jail.
-Shh.

13:05.738 --> 13:07.975
Papa jail.

13:08.042 --> 13:10.848
Okay, do you want
some ice cream?

13:14.922 --> 13:17.093
I've been looking up
all the most common reasons

13:17.193 --> 13:19.064
for being audited,
and nothing is ringing a bell.

13:19.131 --> 13:20.466
Well, why don't you
call an accountant

13:20.534 --> 13:22.003
and get an expert opinion?

13:22.070 --> 13:23.707
Ah, we want to make sure we have
all our ducks in a row first.

13:23.807 --> 13:25.410
-He's gonna shoot 'em down.
-Do you have any foreign
accounts?

13:25.511 --> 13:26.913
You know, maybe something
your dad set up for you

13:27.013 --> 13:28.049
when you were a kid.

13:28.115 --> 13:29.852
Something my dad set up for me?

13:29.919 --> 13:31.155
That's hilarious. Next.

13:31.221 --> 13:33.225
You know, Chim,
I looked into it as well,

13:33.292 --> 13:35.931
and apparently
there's a 0.6% chance

13:36.031 --> 13:37.802
of just being
audited at random.

13:37.902 --> 13:40.139
Lies. Nothing is random.
And nobody is helping!

13:40.206 --> 13:41.509
Neither are you.

13:41.643 --> 13:43.479
Look, don't beat yourself up,
Chim.

13:43.547 --> 13:45.984
I'm not great at doing
my taxes, either. No one is.

13:46.051 --> 13:48.623
-Uh, I am.
-Seriously?

13:48.690 --> 13:50.627
You missed his whole
superpower phase.

13:50.728 --> 13:53.232
I actually thought about using
my newfound math skills

13:53.299 --> 13:56.238
to file my taxes
by hand this year.

13:56.372 --> 13:57.508
-So did you?
-No.

13:57.575 --> 14:00.581
I-I said I thought about it.
I hired a professional.

14:00.647 --> 14:01.482
Still not helping.

14:01.549 --> 14:02.450
Why are you and Maddie doing

14:02.551 --> 14:03.887
your own taxes anyway?

14:03.987 --> 14:07.427
We're using a computer program
instead of a real person,

14:07.494 --> 14:08.797
'cause it's cheaper.

14:08.897 --> 14:10.299
(chuckles) Until they hit you
with the fines.

14:10.366 --> 14:12.571
You guys think I'm a goner,
don't you?

14:12.671 --> 14:14.575
-(alarm ringing)
-Hey, listen, Chim.

14:14.642 --> 14:17.548
Remember, with the IRS
you can run, but you can't hide.

14:23.092 --> 14:24.394
(solemn organ music playing)

14:24.461 --> 14:28.335
Auntie Marie was the glue
of this family.

14:28.402 --> 14:31.710
She left us with
countless memories

14:31.776 --> 14:35.884
and mountains' worth of
unsolicited advice.

14:35.951 --> 14:37.688
(laughter)

14:37.755 --> 14:39.257
But there was
one piece of advice

14:39.357 --> 14:42.297
that she gave to me
that I will cherish forever.

14:43.232 --> 14:45.136
The guiding principle of life

14:45.203 --> 14:46.706
that I will continue to live by

14:46.806 --> 14:50.079
and pass on for generations
to come.

14:50.146 --> 14:53.352
And that piece of advice is...

14:53.419 --> 14:56.626
(panicked screams)

15:16.432 --> 15:20.406
(sirens wailing)

15:30.259 --> 15:32.163
-(indistinct shouting)
-(groans)

15:32.230 --> 15:33.567
(indistinct chatter, groaning)

15:33.700 --> 15:35.103
We were just getting started
when it crashed through

15:35.203 --> 15:36.673
and landed on top of Marie.

15:41.048 --> 15:42.383
EDDIE:
She's breathing.

15:42.484 --> 15:44.387
Looks like this angel was
literally watching over her.

15:44.488 --> 15:47.595
Hen, Ravi, get that driver
out of here.

15:47.661 --> 15:49.297
Eddie, Buck, I want airbags.

15:49.431 --> 15:50.801
Let's get this car
lifted and stabilized

15:50.868 --> 15:51.536
before we move her.

15:51.703 --> 15:53.372
-BUCK: All right.
-HEN: All right.

15:53.507 --> 15:54.942
Are you in any pain?

15:55.042 --> 15:56.145
No, not really?

15:56.245 --> 15:58.115
Did you black out
before the crash?

15:58.215 --> 16:02.090
I saw two parking spaces,
then there was just one.

16:02.223 --> 16:05.329
Clearly not the one
I just drove into.

16:05.429 --> 16:06.165
(groans)

16:06.231 --> 16:08.435
Let's get him on a gurney.

16:14.682 --> 16:16.218
(creaking)

16:16.285 --> 16:20.092
-Okay, Cap, this isn't
gonna hold much longer.
-All right,

16:20.159 --> 16:21.361
hit it on green, let's go.

16:21.428 --> 16:23.499
Going up.

16:25.838 --> 16:27.975
(car creaking)

16:28.042 --> 16:29.477
BOBBY:
That's it, keep going.

16:29.545 --> 16:31.583
I knew these heels would be
the death of me.

16:31.649 --> 16:32.818
Well, you broke your ankle

16:32.885 --> 16:34.154
to avoid being crushed
by a car.

16:34.221 --> 16:35.724
-Take the win.
-BUCK: Almost there.

16:42.838 --> 16:44.241
Okay, we're good.

16:44.307 --> 16:46.245
BOBBY:
All right, let's get her out.
Let's move her.

16:46.345 --> 16:50.119
Okay, on three.
One, two, three.

16:55.263 --> 16:57.701
Hen, I'm gonna need
a hand over here.

16:57.768 --> 16:59.639
I'm on my way.

17:06.084 --> 17:08.222
Vitals are clear.

17:08.289 --> 17:10.159
Obvious fracture to the fibula.

17:10.259 --> 17:12.463
-You good?
-RAVI: Yeah.

17:12.531 --> 17:14.936
I've got this.

17:15.002 --> 17:16.104
She's coming to.

17:16.205 --> 17:19.612
Ma'am, can you hear me?

17:19.679 --> 17:20.981
Everyone came to see me?

17:21.081 --> 17:23.820
-Ma'am, can you
tell me your name?
-Marie.

17:23.887 --> 17:27.460
Hi, Marie, I'm Hen.
How you feeling?

17:27.528 --> 17:28.930
Any specific pain?

17:28.997 --> 17:30.499
I always have pain in my hip.

17:30.567 --> 17:32.538
Backboard.

17:34.107 --> 17:37.413
On three.
One, two, three.

17:39.585 --> 17:42.190
There we go.

17:43.927 --> 17:45.429
I'm sorry for your loss, ma'am.

17:45.530 --> 17:47.133
I-I can't imagine how hard
it must have been

17:47.200 --> 17:49.070
to lose your twin.

17:49.137 --> 17:52.645
Sorry for my loss?
That's me.

17:54.982 --> 17:57.554
You were in attendance
at your own funeral?

17:57.621 --> 18:00.761
Oh, I-I was sitting
right over there.

18:00.827 --> 18:03.032
Now, what better place to be
for your own funeral

18:03.132 --> 18:04.669
than the front row?

18:04.769 --> 18:06.471
It's called a living funeral.

18:06.539 --> 18:10.046
MARIE:
Natalia planned it for me.

18:10.179 --> 18:12.083
She's my death doula.

18:12.150 --> 18:13.586
HEN:
Death doula?

18:13.653 --> 18:16.224
I've only heard of
the other kind.

18:16.291 --> 18:18.563
I prefer "end-of-life" doula.

18:18.630 --> 18:20.600
Here I thought my job
was interesting.

18:20.734 --> 18:23.238
You just lifted a car
off of a human being.

18:23.305 --> 18:25.644
I'd say your job is
pretty interesting.

18:25.711 --> 18:27.347
Hey, Buck, make some room.

18:27.447 --> 18:29.819
Uh, let me take you this way.

18:33.627 --> 18:35.797
All right, ma'am,
try not to move.

18:35.864 --> 18:37.701
You may have dislocated
your hip.

18:37.768 --> 18:39.639
Well, it happens all the time.

18:39.705 --> 18:43.713
A symptom of my everlasting
fight with bone cancer.

18:43.813 --> 18:45.249
Don't lose hope just yet.

18:45.349 --> 18:47.086
This isn't about losing hope.

18:47.153 --> 18:48.857
You see all those people there?

18:48.957 --> 18:51.829
I haven't seen any of them
in years.

18:51.896 --> 18:54.167
I invited them out
to this ceremony

18:54.267 --> 18:55.436
so that I didn't have

18:55.504 --> 18:57.040
-to see them from a casket.
-EDDIE: Hmm.

18:57.106 --> 18:59.612
Where's the fun in that?

19:00.647 --> 19:04.187
I guess that's one way
of throwing a family reunion.

19:04.220 --> 19:06.291
We're all gonna die alone.

19:06.358 --> 19:08.329
Might as well spend time
with our loved ones

19:08.395 --> 19:10.567
while we're still living.

19:16.078 --> 19:18.883
Uh, hey, can I
take a look at that?

19:20.086 --> 19:22.023
I, uh, I meant your hand.

19:22.090 --> 19:26.098
-This? It's just a scratch.
-Well, I-I specialize
in scratches.

19:26.164 --> 19:28.837
Here, why don't you
take a seat? (exhales)

19:32.745 --> 19:36.485
Uh, so, aside from

19:36.552 --> 19:38.656
planning pre-death funerals,

19:38.723 --> 19:42.397
what exactly does
an end-of-life doula do?

19:42.497 --> 19:46.371
Well, if your job is
to prevent death,

19:46.438 --> 19:49.879
my job is
to help people accept it.

19:51.314 --> 19:52.985
You know, you, uh,
you might say

19:53.052 --> 19:56.291
death and I are
old acquaintances.

19:57.060 --> 19:59.030
Maybe even friends
for a moment.

19:59.097 --> 20:01.936
Lucky you.
How'd you pull that off?

20:02.003 --> 20:04.374
I died.
Just for a few minutes.

20:04.441 --> 20:06.713
Struck by lightning.

20:08.516 --> 20:11.889
Wow, that sounds amazing.

20:14.294 --> 20:16.666
-(chuckles)
-(chuckles)

20:17.568 --> 20:20.139
Would you like
to grab a coffee?

20:20.206 --> 20:21.374
I'd love to hear more.

20:21.441 --> 20:25.650
Uh, about your...
about your acquaintance.

20:25.751 --> 20:28.322
Uh, yeah.
Yeah, that sounds nice.

20:28.388 --> 20:31.461
BOBBY:
Buck, let's move.

20:31.529 --> 20:34.835
Uh, I gotta...
I gotta go.

Mom, I'm sorry.

21:40.132 --> 21:41.536
No, we can't visit
that weekend.

21:41.636 --> 21:43.773
Uh, Christopher's got
homecoming on Saturday,

21:43.907 --> 21:47.614
and the weekend after that...
Ah... work.

21:47.681 --> 21:49.752
How about April 22?
That looks free.

21:49.819 --> 21:52.356
Dad, that's the Earth Day
field trip.

21:52.423 --> 21:53.726
It's not on here.

21:53.860 --> 21:55.329
It should be.

21:55.396 --> 21:58.503
Sorry, Mom.

21:58.603 --> 22:01.976
Apparently the Earth is
more important.

22:02.043 --> 22:03.613
-Dad.
-How about...

22:03.746 --> 22:05.550
this summer?

22:05.617 --> 22:07.788
We can make a whole week
out of it.

22:07.855 --> 22:09.290
Dad, we gotta go!

22:09.390 --> 22:11.127
Hey, come talk to your abuela.

22:11.194 --> 22:12.330
We're gonna be late.

22:12.396 --> 22:14.668
Sorry, Mom, I gotta go.

22:14.768 --> 22:16.539
(sighs)

22:16.572 --> 22:20.747
-Dad, hurry up!
-Coming! (sighs)

22:21.916 --> 22:23.753
We'll figure something out.

22:23.820 --> 22:25.322
Okay? I promise.

22:25.422 --> 22:27.761
We got time.

22:36.444 --> 22:39.350
(indistinct conversations)

22:51.408 --> 22:54.447
-What do you think
they're in for?
-Chim...

22:54.515 --> 22:58.055
CHIMNEY:
Fake designer bag. I'm gonna go
with Ponzi scheme masterminds.

22:58.155 --> 23:01.829
-Mr. and Mrs. Nicholson?
-Here.

23:08.242 --> 23:09.110
How about her?

23:09.210 --> 23:12.517
Concealing her beanie
side-hustle on Etsy?

23:12.618 --> 23:13.987
Oh, my God,
will you please play a game

23:14.053 --> 23:15.155
on your phone or something?

23:15.256 --> 23:17.159
You're gonna give me
an aneurysm.

23:17.226 --> 23:19.632
Hey, how come you're so zen
about this all of a sudden?

23:19.698 --> 23:21.368
Because there's nothing
we can do about it.

23:21.434 --> 23:22.871
Yeah, but doesn't it bother you

23:22.938 --> 23:24.708
that the government's gonna be
all up in our business,

23:24.775 --> 23:26.512
combing through
every inch of our lives

23:26.612 --> 23:27.781
with a fine-tooth comb?

23:27.848 --> 23:29.083
'Cause that's what
an audit is, Maddie.

23:29.183 --> 23:30.854
They leave no stone unturned.

23:30.921 --> 23:33.358
Are you afraid that I'm gonna
find out something I shouldn't?

23:33.425 --> 23:35.797
No. You?

23:35.864 --> 23:37.768
Of course not.

23:37.868 --> 23:40.306
Okay, then.

23:40.406 --> 23:42.410
Hey, do they still have
debtors' prison?

23:42.476 --> 23:45.149
This isn't a Dickens novel.

23:46.418 --> 23:48.589
Buckley, Han?

23:49.658 --> 23:52.129
-Follow me.
-Remember what we said.

23:52.196 --> 23:53.365
Never take candy from strangers

23:53.432 --> 23:55.069
except on Halloween.

23:55.135 --> 23:57.373
Don't give them any information
unless they ask for it.

23:57.440 --> 24:00.245
We are fine.
Just... relax.

24:00.312 --> 24:02.183
Right.

24:19.585 --> 24:20.687
Do you know why you're here?

24:20.754 --> 24:21.956
The letters didn't say.

24:22.056 --> 24:23.960
This is a test.
It's a test, isn't it?

24:24.060 --> 24:26.832
Your returns indicate
what we believe to be tax fraud.

24:26.899 --> 24:29.003
Tax fraud?

24:29.103 --> 24:30.940
No, no, no. We're not--
We would never...

24:31.007 --> 24:32.544
We're not criminals.
I mean, look at us.

24:32.611 --> 24:35.817
We're not frauds, either.
We're actually very genuine.

24:35.884 --> 24:39.490
Do you both reside at the
address listen on your returns?

24:39.558 --> 24:42.396
-Yes. Yes, we do.
-Yes. Yes.

24:42.463 --> 24:43.633
And yet you both
filed separately

24:43.733 --> 24:45.069
and both claimed
head of household.

24:45.135 --> 24:47.908
I thought I was gonna claim
head of household.

24:47.974 --> 24:49.978
-Yeah, to which I replied
I already had.
-I pay over half

24:50.045 --> 24:51.882
-the expenses.
-I pay plenty of expenses.

24:51.982 --> 24:53.853
Enough ice cream to feed
a small village doesn't count.

24:53.920 --> 24:55.322
It does if your family eats
like a small village.

24:55.422 --> 24:58.830
-(clears throat)
-It was an honest mistake.

24:58.896 --> 25:01.434
It's only your first violation.

25:01.502 --> 25:02.871
There's more than one?

25:02.971 --> 25:05.777
The dependent,
Jee-Yun Buckley Han.

25:05.844 --> 25:07.814
You both claimed her as well.

25:08.583 --> 25:10.219
Oh. I didn't know that
you were gonna claim Jee.

25:10.285 --> 25:11.722
I guess we didn't really
discuss it.

25:11.822 --> 25:13.091
You know what, filing
on the computer, it was...

25:13.158 --> 25:14.762
-it was very quick...
-It was just so fast

25:14.895 --> 25:15.997
and we just...
I-I think that's just another

25:16.064 --> 25:17.834
-honest mistake.
-Mm. You're two for two?

25:17.901 --> 25:20.172
-Is there more?
-You tell me.

25:20.239 --> 25:22.577
Okay...

25:25.517 --> 25:27.053
(sighs) I...

25:27.153 --> 25:29.157
Okay, I borrowed money
from my parents to buy a house,

25:29.223 --> 25:30.927
and I didn't claim it as income.

25:31.027 --> 25:32.864
Probably claimed some medical
expenses we shouldn't have

25:32.931 --> 25:34.067
when our daughter was
in the hospital.

25:34.133 --> 25:35.570
She had a viral infection.

25:35.670 --> 25:37.206
-And then we thought
it got worse.
-But she's okay,

25:37.306 --> 25:39.177
and we have receipts from
the hospital if you need 'em.

25:39.243 --> 25:41.882
I donated my old car to charity.

25:41.949 --> 25:45.289
None of that was flagged
on your returns.

25:45.389 --> 25:47.326
So we're good?

25:47.393 --> 25:49.097
No, you are not.

25:49.197 --> 25:50.165
Are we going to debtors' prison?

25:50.265 --> 25:51.501
This isn't a Dickens novel.

25:51.569 --> 25:52.938
That's what I said.

25:53.038 --> 25:55.275
DEBBIE: We just send people
to regular prison now.

25:56.344 --> 25:59.016
You will both need to refile
your returns correctly,

25:59.083 --> 26:00.219
upon which time
we will determine

26:00.285 --> 26:01.522
precisely what you owe.

26:01.622 --> 26:03.391
-CHIM: That's it?
-You will also need to decide

26:03.492 --> 26:05.262
who is the head
of your household.

26:07.032 --> 26:08.803
Well, we could switch
every year.

26:08.870 --> 26:10.139
I love that idea.
Let's just alternate.

26:10.205 --> 26:12.276
-Love it.
-I love how awesome
you're being.

26:12.376 --> 26:13.679
-(both laugh)
-(Debbie clears throat)

26:13.746 --> 26:15.315
You should leave my desk
immediately.

26:15.382 --> 26:17.019
-Understood.
-Departing now.

26:18.422 --> 26:20.292
(sighs)

26:21.394 --> 26:24.066
BUCK:
So, uh... how's Marie?

26:25.570 --> 26:26.972
Physically, she's not well.

26:27.106 --> 26:28.843
I mean,
she survived the accident,

26:28.943 --> 26:30.814
and won't have
any major injuries--

26:30.880 --> 26:32.149
thanks to you guys-- but

26:32.249 --> 26:34.053
it's not like
it slowed down the cancer.

26:34.120 --> 26:38.195
Emotionally, however, she's...
she's doing really great.

26:38.261 --> 26:39.698
Well, thanks to you.

26:39.765 --> 26:41.569
(stammers) It's fascinating.

26:41.635 --> 26:44.541
I-I never knew someone could
spend their life

26:44.641 --> 26:48.850
bringing people
closer to death... legally.

26:48.950 --> 26:51.421
But you've been closer
than anybody.

26:51.522 --> 26:53.158
Been there and come back.

26:53.225 --> 26:55.462
That is so freakin' cool.

26:55.597 --> 26:58.101
-I don't know. Cool?
-Well, wasn't it?

26:58.168 --> 26:59.671
Come on, be honest.

26:59.738 --> 27:00.974
Look how excited you are.

27:01.074 --> 27:03.846
You're like a legit fangirl
for this stuff.

27:03.913 --> 27:06.151
You might say
I'm dying to know.

27:06.217 --> 27:07.888
Pun very much intended.

27:07.954 --> 27:09.157
(chuckles)

27:12.129 --> 27:15.670
I'll start by saying
I woke up in a world

27:15.737 --> 27:19.210
that was both everything
and nothing

27:19.277 --> 27:21.281
I ever wanted it to be.

27:22.416 --> 27:24.755
I can tell from the look
on your face

27:24.822 --> 27:26.759
that made absolutely
no sense.

27:26.826 --> 27:29.130
Firefighter and philosopher.
Noted.

27:29.197 --> 27:32.671
Yeah. Uh, okay,
but let me start again.

27:34.240 --> 27:35.977
I-I woke up in a hospital.

27:36.044 --> 27:40.185
And at first, everything seemed
completely normal.

27:43.659 --> 27:44.995
Athena.

27:45.062 --> 27:48.201
Oh, sorry to impose
on your lunch, Luann.

27:48.268 --> 27:50.372
It's all right.
How can I help you?

27:50.439 --> 27:51.976
Well, I'm here
on unofficial business.

27:52.076 --> 27:55.482
We had a suspect go down
during an arrest the other day.

27:55.550 --> 27:56.685
A Dominic Dawson.

27:56.752 --> 27:58.288
That name sounds familiar.

27:58.355 --> 28:02.396
I believe he was admitted
to the ER yesterday.

28:02.463 --> 28:03.533
Yes.

28:03.633 --> 28:06.371
We picked up his body
yesterday evening.

28:06.404 --> 28:07.874
Do we have any information

28:07.941 --> 28:09.778
-on his cause of death yet?
-Not yet.

28:09.845 --> 28:11.114
Unfortunately,
we're backlogged.

28:11.180 --> 28:13.218
-That bus accident downtown.
-(exhales)

28:13.318 --> 28:16.391
It'll probably be another day
or two before I get to him.

28:16.491 --> 28:19.698
-So we know nothing.
-Listen,

28:19.798 --> 28:22.069
you're more than welcome
to take a look at the body--

28:22.136 --> 28:24.140
-unofficially.
-If that's okay.

28:24.240 --> 28:28.683
Ah. Uh, honestly,
looking at a body

28:28.749 --> 28:31.187
doesn't always tell you much.

28:31.254 --> 28:36.264
Our answers are usually found
under the skin.

28:46.351 --> 28:50.092
Here we are.
Dominic Dawson.

28:53.733 --> 28:55.469
This can't be right.

28:55.570 --> 28:57.306
That isn't him.

28:57.974 --> 29:00.279
He's listed as number 107.

29:02.951 --> 29:04.821
This is his bracelet.

29:04.888 --> 29:07.326
But not his body.

29:07.459 --> 29:09.831
So, then, who is this?

29:09.898 --> 29:13.338
And where is Dominic Dawson?

29:19.216 --> 29:22.524
-(police radio chatter)
-(indistinct conversations)

29:27.199 --> 29:29.738
Body's been identified
as Seth Davis.

29:29.838 --> 29:32.744
Any idea when he swapped
the hospital bracelet?

29:32.811 --> 29:35.182
Security footage doesn't show
anybody unusual

29:35.248 --> 29:36.585
coming or going, so,

29:36.685 --> 29:38.990
must have made the swap
before the transfer.

29:39.056 --> 29:40.660
After he came back
from the dead.

29:40.760 --> 29:43.164
Officers found a bottle
of Lisinopril--

29:43.264 --> 29:45.168
it's a blood pressure
medication--

29:45.235 --> 29:48.041
emptied in his bathroom,
so he must have given himself

29:48.108 --> 29:49.477
just enough of an overdose.

29:49.544 --> 29:52.584
Caused his vitals to plummet
in the back of your car.

29:52.684 --> 29:54.353
-Why would someone do that?
-In this case,

29:54.420 --> 29:57.661
I figure it's gotta be
one of three things:

29:57.761 --> 30:00.198
money, money or money.

30:00.265 --> 30:02.537
-(chuckles)
-But I'm actually more curious

30:02.604 --> 30:05.943
as to what you were doing here
in the first place.

30:06.010 --> 30:09.951
Finding out that
our suspect wasn't dead.

30:11.655 --> 30:12.724
Anything?

30:12.824 --> 30:14.528
Only explanation I have
is he was given

30:14.594 --> 30:16.164
the wrong bracelet in the ER.

30:16.230 --> 30:18.068
-And how likely is that?
-LUANN: It's not.

30:18.134 --> 30:19.538
But it's also not impossible.

30:19.671 --> 30:21.909
We may be looking at
a simple mistake.

30:21.975 --> 30:24.280
Oh, no.
This was not a mistake.

30:24.380 --> 30:26.885
BOBBY:
Well, you got what
you hoped for.

30:26.952 --> 30:28.388
You found your answer.

30:28.455 --> 30:30.392
ATHENA:
Well, I found the first answer.

30:30.492 --> 30:32.162
And like any good answer,

30:32.262 --> 30:34.735
it raised a whole lot
of new questions.

30:34.801 --> 30:36.404
I spoke with Hen
about the Lisinopril.

30:36.471 --> 30:38.341
She said it would have
bottomed out his blood pressure

30:38.441 --> 30:39.611
for about 20 minutes.

30:39.678 --> 30:41.582
Dominic!

30:42.116 --> 30:43.385
So he could have
come to in the ER,

30:43.451 --> 30:44.353
made the switch then.

30:44.420 --> 30:45.656
PARAMEDIC (over radio):
Harvey,

30:45.723 --> 30:46.658
we need some help

30:46.725 --> 30:48.461

-Roger that.

ATHENA:
The ER was inundated
after that bus crash.

30:55.175 --> 30:58.114
BOBBY:
He was able to get out,
but go where?

30:58.181 --> 31:00.185
ATHENA:
That's the million-dollar
question.

31:00.252 --> 31:01.922
The police have been
tossing his house

31:02.022 --> 31:03.959
looking for the money he stole.

31:05.763 --> 31:07.834
I just don't like having people
in my house.

31:07.901 --> 31:10.272
Oh, well, they should only
be there two,

about your math skills.

36:24.466 --> 36:27.005
Maybe I even tried
to get rich off of 'em.

36:27.105 --> 36:29.476
But to be honest,

36:29.577 --> 36:33.351
you haven't been the same
since it happened.

36:34.019 --> 36:36.157
-But how could you be?
-(sighs)

36:36.223 --> 36:38.227
The truth is, man, uh,

36:38.294 --> 36:40.833
I-I still don't know how to act.

36:40.900 --> 36:43.471
I am different.

36:43.539 --> 36:47.513
I feel like
I have to try and be the...

36:47.580 --> 36:49.083
same old Buck.

36:49.149 --> 36:52.690
Mostly for the sake
of everyone else.

36:53.859 --> 36:55.930
You don't have to be anything
for anybody.

36:56.030 --> 36:59.537
And no one is ever the same
from one day to the next.

36:59.637 --> 37:04.647
Experiences like this,
they change us.

37:07.920 --> 37:09.891
So what changed in you?

37:09.991 --> 37:12.162
Well, when I woke up

37:12.229 --> 37:14.868
in that hospital,

37:14.968 --> 37:17.740
I felt like I had gotten away
with something.

37:17.807 --> 37:19.544
You cheated death.

37:19.611 --> 37:22.750
My life could have ended
right then and there,

37:22.817 --> 37:25.488
but it-it didn't.

37:25.556 --> 37:27.860
That has to mean something,
right?

37:27.894 --> 37:29.329
It means you're one lucky guy.

37:29.430 --> 37:31.868
Yeah, well, I don't think
I'm gonna get that lucky again.

37:31.935 --> 37:33.171
Well, maybe you don't have to.

37:33.304 --> 37:34.574
Lightning doesn't strike
the same place twice.

37:34.674 --> 37:36.778
Which is why
I have to make the most

37:36.878 --> 37:38.515
of every single moment.

37:38.549 --> 37:41.387
Because from here on out...

37:42.757 --> 37:45.328
...it's all a gift.

37:55.115 --> 37:56.383
Okay.

37:56.450 --> 38:00.793
One black coffee,
and one affogato.

38:03.264 --> 38:06.070
Affogato. Fancy.

38:06.170 --> 38:07.305
Yeah, we've got
a lot of ice cream

38:07.439 --> 38:08.609
we need to get rid of.

38:08.675 --> 38:09.844
Thanks for coming by
so last-minute.

38:09.911 --> 38:12.115
-We really appreciate it.
-Of course.

38:12.182 --> 38:13.619
I would have invited you
to my office,

38:13.685 --> 38:15.355
but it's a little charred
at the moment.

38:15.421 --> 38:18.361
I heard. I guess this tax stuff
does make people crazy.

38:18.427 --> 38:19.363
You have no idea.

38:19.463 --> 38:20.766
We kind of do, actually.

38:20.866 --> 38:23.237
So this head of household
business, that's just about

38:23.337 --> 38:24.339
who makes the most money?

38:24.406 --> 38:26.511
Or who spends the most money?

38:26.578 --> 38:28.481
Let me simplify it for you.

38:28.582 --> 38:30.886
File together,
save yourselves $14,000.

38:30.953 --> 38:33.792
I know it's not the most
romantic thing in the world,

38:33.926 --> 38:35.395
-but...
-$14,000?

38:35.461 --> 38:36.865
Sounds pretty romantic to me.

38:36.932 --> 38:41.575
Great. So, next year,
before you file your taxes,

38:41.641 --> 38:43.512
there's only one thing
you need to do.

38:43.579 --> 38:46.483
-Great.
-We'll be ready. What is it?

38:47.987 --> 38:49.891
Get married.

40:44.787 --> 40:46.758
Yeah, I know it's late.
I'm sorry.

40:46.825 --> 40:48.996
I was thinking maybe
we could watch it together

40:49.062 --> 40:51.601

40:52.803 --> 40:53.872
I know.

(chuckles) Yeah, I know.

40:56.043 --> 40:58.114
I know, it's last-minute,
but I miss you guys,

40:58.214 --> 41:00.653
and I know Christopher does,
too.

41:03.090 --> 41:06.096
Exactly. Why wait?

41:07.767 --> 41:10.138
Well, there's no better time
than now.

41:10.204 --> 41:12.008
So that accountant guy suggests
you two get married,

41:12.075 --> 41:14.079
and you just go about your
business like nothing happened?

41:14.179 --> 41:16.417
Well, it felt awkward
to talk about it afterwards,

41:16.483 --> 41:18.120
so I just kind of
snuck out this morning.

41:18.154 --> 41:20.491
So now you're gonna go home,
and the elephant is still

41:20.592 --> 41:21.761
gonna be standing in the room.

41:21.828 --> 41:22.997
I can't be the one
to bring it up.

41:23.030 --> 41:24.701
It'll feel like
I'm pressuring him.

41:24.801 --> 41:27.205
Broaching the subject isn't
the same thing as pressure.

41:34.252 --> 41:36.725
that never wanted
to marry anyone ever again.

Yeah, but this is Chimney.
