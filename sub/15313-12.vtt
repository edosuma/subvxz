00:12.200 --> 00:14.668
Ah. Gisborne.

00:14.735 --> 00:17.136
Hold a bird. Come on.

00:17.205 --> 00:20.833
Here, come on. Give him some love. Hm?

00:20.907 --> 00:23.376
Poor thing.

00:24.177 --> 00:26.975
It is poetry, though, isn't it?

00:27.047 --> 00:30.983
Caged bird, a creature that would fly free,

00:31.051 --> 00:33.144
absolutely under my control.

00:33.220 --> 00:36.246
It's good, I like it.

00:37.056 --> 00:40.857
Now, talking of caged prettiness...

00:40.927 --> 00:43.088
when are you marrying Marian?

00:44.064 --> 00:47.795
- In due course.
- Oh, come along, don't be coy.

00:47.868 --> 00:50.597
- That's not the arrangement, is it?
- No.

00:50.669 --> 00:54.128
- We will marry when the King returns.
- Ah.

00:54.207 --> 00:58.199
When the King comes.
I might have news for you there.

01:00.146 --> 01:01.613
- What news?
- Do you know,

01:01.680 --> 01:04.205
sometimes I don't feed them
for, ooh, three days.

01:04.283 --> 01:07.218
Cruel, perhaps, but I find it
makes them sing better.

01:07.286 --> 01:09.549
What news?

01:11.089 --> 01:13.388
Oh, Gisborne.

01:14.793 --> 01:16.761
I hate the cave.

01:16.828 --> 01:19.558
It's gonna rain again
and it's dry in there.

01:19.631 --> 01:23.158
It's dark and it's, you know, horrible.

01:23.767 --> 01:25.668
We voted, Much.

01:25.769 --> 01:27.704
And you lost, five-one.

01:28.606 --> 01:29.936
Yeah, well...

01:30.007 --> 01:32.908
I should have two votes,
because I really don't like the cave.

01:32.976 --> 01:35.945
In fact, I should have three,
because I really, really don't like the cave.

01:43.220 --> 01:46.986
Bats! I hate... bats!

01:47.056 --> 01:50.184
Bats are rats, rats with wings.

01:50.259 --> 01:54.457
No, they are intelligent.
Bats make noises you cannot hear.

01:54.530 --> 01:56.725
What's the point of that? Noises you can't hear?

01:56.800 --> 01:59.495
- What if there was a noise nobody could hear?
- Shut up.

01:59.569 --> 02:01.969
And then if you were the only person
who could hear it.

02:02.038 --> 02:04.097
Because I am that person.

02:04.174 --> 02:07.540
To see sense where others see no sense.

02:07.610 --> 02:09.578
Just like the bat.

02:09.645 --> 02:11.441
I take it back.

02:11.546 --> 02:13.514
I like the bat.

02:14.749 --> 02:18.242
The bat is my friend.
The bat understands me.

02:21.556 --> 02:24.184
What took you so long?
Hoh!

02:25.260 --> 02:27.057
Well done!

02:27.129 --> 02:29.097
Bread, good.

02:29.164 --> 02:32.600
Mmm.

02:33.635 --> 02:35.364
All right!

02:38.772 --> 02:40.034
Well?

02:42.410 --> 02:44.503
What's the matter?

02:47.615 --> 02:48.980
The King is coming.

03:29.054 --> 03:31.181
Richard? To England?

03:31.257 --> 03:33.247
Yeah, that'll be right!

03:33.359 --> 03:35.952
It's not a rumor, John.

03:37.396 --> 03:40.422
I spoke to Thornton. He heard Gisborne talking.

03:40.499 --> 03:42.830
- To England?
- To Nottingham.

03:42.901 --> 03:45.926
They're saying he's landed at Hull,
he's gonna come here on his way to London.

03:46.003 --> 03:48.404
The King? To Nottingham?

03:48.473 --> 03:50.668
Oh, this is good, isn't it?

03:50.742 --> 03:52.505
- The King?
- Yes.

03:53.444 --> 03:57.175
Oh, this is a good day.
After all, we have bread and the King is coming.

03:57.248 --> 03:59.443
- Will you just shut up?
- No!

03:59.517 --> 04:03.953
This is what we've been waiting for.
The Sheriff will be ousted, and Gisborne.

04:04.020 --> 04:06.215
Then Robin can go home, I can go home,
Little John...

04:06.290 --> 04:10.385
- Little John's an outlaw, we all are.
- Robin will pardon you.

04:10.460 --> 04:12.691
Obviously.
Will?

04:12.763 --> 04:14.627
Oh, this is great, isn't it?

04:14.732 --> 04:17.632
Well, we should have a feast! This is wonderful!

04:17.733 --> 04:19.394
Shut up!

04:19.469 --> 04:22.529
- Will.
- Well, excuse me for being pleased

04:22.606 --> 04:24.574
that all our prayers are answered.

04:27.244 --> 04:28.939
Tell me.

04:33.782 --> 04:35.750
Come on, tell me.

04:37.053 --> 04:41.216
Gisborne is saying... Now the King's
coming back, Gisborne is saying...

04:41.291 --> 04:43.224
Gisborne is saying he'll marry Marian.

04:45.794 --> 04:47.694
Ah.

04:54.869 --> 04:56.837
She'll never go through with it.

04:57.739 --> 04:59.640
Gisborne says the wedding's on Saturday.

05:07.415 --> 05:08.746
Marian.

05:08.816 --> 05:10.511
Sir Edward.

05:14.689 --> 05:17.054
I bring good news.

05:17.157 --> 05:19.182
There 's something I...

05:19.259 --> 05:20.921
No.

05:20.995 --> 05:24.395
- Oh! What are you doing?
- What do you think you...?

05:28.869 --> 05:30.803
Sir Guy!

05:32.839 --> 05:34.830
I apologize.

05:34.941 --> 05:37.171
I just wanted to sweep you off your feet.

05:40.681 --> 05:43.241
- Will you come with me to Locksley?
- Why?

05:43.349 --> 05:44.977
There 's something you should see.

05:54.393 --> 05:56.623
- Lady Marian.
- Thornton.

06:00.466 --> 06:03.435
Come with me, there 's something
I want to show you.

06:06.572 --> 06:07.936
I show you this.

06:12.877 --> 06:15.243
- My wealth.
- Why?

06:16.481 --> 06:19.143
Er... I'm not sure what this means.

06:19.751 --> 06:21.719
This means everything.

06:23.555 --> 06:25.887
This means that I am a man of substance.

06:27.024 --> 06:28.686
Wealth I can provide for you.

06:30.729 --> 06:32.697
I'm a man of power.

06:33.397 --> 06:35.627
The Sheriff and I, increasingly with Ki...

06:35.733 --> 06:37.826
Prince John.

06:40.971 --> 06:44.407
This means that I am a man of lineage.

06:47.276 --> 06:49.642
The Gisborne heritage is a proud one.

06:55.018 --> 06:56.951
I will be glad to continue that line...

06:59.555 --> 07:01.353
with you...

07:03.025 --> 07:04.788
as my wife.

07:04.861 --> 07:06.829
Something has changed.

07:10.433 --> 07:11.797
The King is returning.

07:20.275 --> 07:22.175
Help me bring this out.

07:35.557 --> 07:37.956
How much more have we got?

07:41.863 --> 07:45.798
Mary! Thomas! Come on!
Get on with it, there 's work to be done.

07:46.767 --> 07:47.927
Roll it.

07:48.002 --> 07:49.970
Come on, help me with this barrel.

07:50.037 --> 07:51.800
Put it over there.

07:53.140 --> 07:58.441
- Robin, I don't know what to say, I am sorry.
- Tell me what you know.

07:58.545 --> 08:03.312
Well, the King comes on Saturday, the wedding
takes place on Saturday here at Locksley.

08:03.383 --> 08:06.784
Er, they're going to decorate the church.

08:06.853 --> 08:08.821
I need you to cast your mind back...

08:10.457 --> 08:12.220
to my absence.

08:12.325 --> 08:14.919
Gisborne was unwell, or so he said.

08:14.994 --> 08:18.225
The truth is, he went to the Holy Land
to try to kill the King.

08:21.034 --> 08:24.992
Well, Robin, I'd love to say
that you were right

08:25.070 --> 08:27.732
but he was here.

08:27.806 --> 08:30.297
- He was unwell.
- But no one was allowed to see him!

08:30.375 --> 08:33.640
- Shh! A fever, a contagion.
- Conta...

08:33.745 --> 08:39.274
But the physician came every day.
I cooked the master' s meal every day.

08:39.351 --> 08:41.615
The physician took it in to him.

08:41.720 --> 08:43.711
- No.
- Who was this physician?

08:43.789 --> 08:45.347
Erm...

08:46.257 --> 08:49.385
- Pitts is his name.
- And where does this Pitts live?

08:49.460 --> 08:53.328
In Nottingham now, in Battley Street.

08:53.397 --> 08:54.922
But... Robin...

08:55.000 --> 08:57.025
This wedding cannot happen.

09:10.580 --> 09:15.415
I would prefer if you did not
visit my house until it is mine again.

09:15.519 --> 09:18.682
Guy wanted to show me my future fortune
as Lady Gisborne.

09:21.391 --> 09:26.021
And what? He showed you some trinkets?
Made you agree to go along with the wedding?

09:26.129 --> 09:29.496
You know I have no choice. I promised
to marry him when the King returned.

09:29.565 --> 09:32.033
- Under duress.
- Yes, under duress.

09:32.135 --> 09:34.967
Proving my loyalty to save my life
and my father' s.

09:35.037 --> 09:37.972
A promise made under duress
is no promise at all.

09:38.040 --> 09:42.101
And what, you think I should just back out
and Guy will smile and release me?

09:42.177 --> 09:45.146
If he knew I betrayed him,
if he knew I was the Nightwatchman,

09:45.214 --> 09:47.943
he would lash out, and not just at me.

09:48.017 --> 09:49.712
At my father.

09:54.055 --> 09:55.955
- Why do you always do this?
- What?

09:56.024 --> 09:58.117
Use your father as an excuse for doing nothing?

09:58.192 --> 10:00.821
- Because my father needs me.
- And you need him!

10:00.930 --> 10:03.159
Because without him,
you would have to make a choice.

10:03.231 --> 10:06.792
Oh, very well, then, I am making a choice.
I'm choosing to marry Gisborne.

10:08.469 --> 10:10.494
Is that what you want me to say?

10:10.572 --> 10:12.631
- I will deal with this.
- How?

10:14.274 --> 10:17.733
I will expose him as the liar and the traitor
that he is, then you will not have to marry him.

10:17.812 --> 10:20.405
Robin, please do not make this
more difficult than it is.

10:20.514 --> 10:22.709
- You do not love him!
- He has qualities!

10:22.783 --> 10:25.513
- What qualities?
- I believe his feelings for me are genuine,

10:25.586 --> 10:29.147
- he has wealth and security...
- What do you mean, wealth?

10:29.222 --> 10:30.917
You're supposed to be the Nightwatchman.

10:30.991 --> 10:34.619
You should steal from Gisborne and give
to the poor, not acquire wealth yourself!

10:34.728 --> 10:37.094
Do not tell me what I should be doing, please.

10:37.164 --> 10:39.098
- Robin!
- Look at me.

10:39.166 --> 10:40.928
Look at me.

10:42.536 --> 10:44.436
- I will deal with this.
- Robin!

10:45.472 --> 10:47.905
Can't you see that you're upsetting Marian?

10:59.185 --> 11:01.982
I must leave for Merton. Will you be all right?

11:02.053 --> 11:03.578
You have some scheme?

11:03.656 --> 11:06.146
The Sheriff has a scheme.

11:06.224 --> 11:09.193
I think he intends to kill the King in Nottingham.

11:09.961 --> 11:12.122
He cannot risk losing the shire.

11:13.933 --> 11:17.800
I must act. Merton is loyal to me
and to the King. He will help.

11:17.869 --> 11:19.837
And my marriage...

11:20.905 --> 11:22.873
I must go through with it.

11:24.009 --> 11:25.874
A man must...

11:25.944 --> 11:27.969
protect his king.

11:28.046 --> 11:30.173
A man must fight for his king.

11:31.548 --> 11:34.143
If could protect you and the King, I would.

11:34.219 --> 11:36.278
I know.

11:37.855 --> 11:39.789
Anyway, I have a plan of my own.

11:39.857 --> 11:42.917
What? The Nightwatchman?

11:43.761 --> 11:48.221
One final fling, something to make me feel
more comfortable in my marriage.

11:53.370 --> 11:57.328
You are my world. You know that.

11:57.407 --> 12:01.503
I'm marrying a man I do not love.
There are worse things in heaven and earth.

12:02.812 --> 12:06.543
And I am glad and proud...

12:08.451 --> 12:10.419
that you are my father.

12:11.387 --> 12:14.720
My wonderful, honorable father.

12:44.219 --> 12:48.381
Battley Street.
Yeah. The physician's.

12:52.960 --> 12:55.190
Master, all clear.

12:59.233 --> 13:02.668
The physician's on his way.
Let's see what Pitts has to say

13:02.736 --> 13:04.795
- about Gisborne's illness.
- Aye.

13:04.904 --> 13:09.500
I was thinking, we spend our lives skulking,
hiding in shadows.

13:09.576 --> 13:12.136
I've grown used to it. Be strange when it's over.

13:12.212 --> 13:15.772
- Hard to imagine.
- Well, soon it will be real.

13:15.848 --> 13:18.908
If Gisborne is exposed, Robin will be restored,

13:18.984 --> 13:21.817
and I will have my lodge, my Bonchurch.

13:22.589 --> 13:24.317
Robin.

13:24.791 --> 13:27.020
Allan, what will you do?

13:27.126 --> 13:29.026
Me?

13:29.796 --> 13:32.263
Well, live in my lodge.

13:32.331 --> 13:34.856
Yeah, you know, servants and that.

13:35.801 --> 13:37.894
- What about you?
- Carpentry, I suppose.

13:39.237 --> 13:40.933
- Wood.
- There 's Pitts.

14:11.568 --> 14:13.160
I have nothing of value.

14:13.236 --> 14:14.999
- What was the trick?
- What trick?

14:15.105 --> 14:18.472
You are the physician who treated
Guy of Gisborne at Locksley a year ago?

14:18.542 --> 14:20.169
- You're Robin.
- What was the trick?

14:20.243 --> 14:22.871
- There was no trick.
- I see.

14:23.813 --> 14:27.545
So tell me... what illness did he have?

14:27.617 --> 14:31.747
Well, difficult to say. Fever, contagion,
the humors out of balance.

14:31.821 --> 14:34.518
Do not lie. My humors are out of balance.

14:34.591 --> 14:37.081
He was very ill, he is lucky to be alive.

14:37.159 --> 14:41.357
I do not have time for this.
You tell me the truth.

14:41.430 --> 14:45.092
You're a peace-lover, I have heard.

14:47.035 --> 14:49.004
You will not harm me.

14:51.239 --> 14:54.971
You think you do Gisborne an innocent favor.
You do not.

14:56.644 --> 14:59.170
This is a matter of treason.
Admit your part now,

14:59.247 --> 15:02.375
and when King Richard returns
I will speak for you.

15:04.185 --> 15:06.483
I established a quarantine.

15:06.554 --> 15:10.615
The servants prepared their master' s meals,
I took the meals in to him.

15:10.725 --> 15:13.853
I sat there for an hour at a time,
ate the meals myself...

15:14.795 --> 15:16.763
brought out empty dishes.

15:16.830 --> 15:18.491
You're a fool.

15:18.565 --> 15:20.795
I meant no harm,
Sir Guy had business in London.

15:20.901 --> 15:24.667
He had business in the Holy Land.
He tried to kill the King.

15:24.738 --> 15:26.706
I had no idea.

15:27.708 --> 15:30.733
Forgive me. What can I do?

15:30.811 --> 15:32.972
Master! Soldiers!

15:33.046 --> 15:36.708
I will require you to speak in evidence.

15:38.452 --> 15:41.615
- Before the King.
- I, really? Do you think l-I...

15:41.722 --> 15:43.154
Yes.

15:43.222 --> 15:45.156
Good decision.

16:05.110 --> 16:06.577
Ungh!

16:10.015 --> 16:11.676
Urgh!

16:47.184 --> 16:48.912
Marian.

16:48.985 --> 16:50.715
Marian!

16:54.625 --> 16:57.559
The torches are on but there 's no one home.

16:57.627 --> 17:00.790
Oh, that's like Much.

17:00.896 --> 17:02.865
Yeah, very funny.

17:04.200 --> 17:06.292
- Where is she?
- Maybe she's run away

17:06.368 --> 17:09.269
- to avoid marrying Gisborne.
- Not Marian.

17:09.338 --> 17:11.499
She's not the running kind.

17:11.573 --> 17:14.065
Well, let's come back tomorrow.

17:14.142 --> 17:16.109
We can wait.

17:18.981 --> 17:20.915
I know where she is. Quick.

17:20.983 --> 17:23.246
- She's stealing Gisborne's money!
- Oh, good work.

17:27.622 --> 17:29.852
Sir Guy! The Nightwatchman.

17:38.733 --> 17:41.065
Urgh! Grrr!

17:42.970 --> 17:44.733
Open up.

17:44.805 --> 17:46.773
There 's no escape.

17:47.775 --> 17:50.903
Get me an ax. You two, outside,
cover the windows in case he jumps.

18:15.935 --> 18:17.903
Time to play, Nightwatchman.

18:20.006 --> 18:21.199
Grrr!

18:24.010 --> 18:26.773
Ah, ah, ah! Mind if I join in?

18:28.947 --> 18:30.471
Locksley!

18:32.885 --> 18:34.512
Have you heard the news?

18:34.586 --> 18:37.054
I'm to marry Marian.

18:49.434 --> 18:52.801
I will think about you
when I take her to the marriage bed.

18:55.840 --> 18:57.602
Agh!

19:08.118 --> 19:09.983
Get the money!

19:12.289 --> 19:14.553
- I've got it.
- Go, go.

19:17.294 --> 19:18.352
Good night, gents.

19:19.162 --> 19:22.529
Split up, twos and threes.
You know where to meet.

19:35.979 --> 19:37.707
Gotcha.

19:50.226 --> 19:52.194
What do you think you're doing?

19:52.294 --> 19:54.887
This Nightwatchman business
will be the death of you.

19:54.963 --> 19:57.090
These are my last days as the Nightwatchman.

19:57.166 --> 19:59.565
I will not be able to do it
when I am at Locksley.

19:59.634 --> 20:01.659
You do not have to go back to Locksley.

20:01.736 --> 20:04.466
I told you. You do not have to marry him.

20:04.538 --> 20:06.665
- I have no choice.
- No.

20:07.408 --> 20:11.344
I was coming to tell you I have the proof I need.

20:11.412 --> 20:14.073
The physician, the physician will talk.

20:14.149 --> 20:16.583
I found him and he agreed to give evidence.

20:16.683 --> 20:20.175
He did not treat Gisborne.
Gisborne was not there.

20:20.287 --> 20:24.121
- He was in the Holy Land.
- And he will say this in public?

20:25.125 --> 20:26.922
Shh.

20:26.994 --> 20:29.360
Really?

20:29.429 --> 20:31.397
Thank you.

20:31.498 --> 20:33.557
I do not know how to thank you.

20:33.634 --> 20:35.864
We'll think of something.

20:36.703 --> 20:38.671
Come on.

20:45.077 --> 20:46.704
Robin...

20:50.016 --> 20:51.506
Marian?

21:01.961 --> 21:04.191
No sign of anyone.

21:04.297 --> 21:08.562
I don't understand. Where are they?

21:11.136 --> 21:12.694
John!

21:14.139 --> 21:16.164
John!

21:25.517 --> 21:28.144
I've got her. I've got her.

21:28.219 --> 21:29.948
All right, all right.

21:30.020 --> 21:31.578
- Gisborne stabbed her.
- What?

21:31.690 --> 21:33.748
- In the belly.
- It is a shallow wound,

21:33.824 --> 21:35.655
not serious.

21:37.428 --> 21:41.455
We need dry bedding.
She needs to get dry.

21:41.532 --> 21:44.125
Get a light.
Here.

21:44.200 --> 21:46.293
John. John!

21:48.137 --> 21:51.129
I need clean water to wash the wound.

21:51.207 --> 21:53.675
Here, here.

21:55.311 --> 21:57.040
- Do you have wine?
- A little.

21:57.113 --> 21:59.137
- For the pain.
- Yes.

22:04.954 --> 22:07.149
This is not long. What did he use?

22:07.222 --> 22:08.986
I don't know.

22:09.092 --> 22:10.786
- I thought he punched her.
- A dagger.

22:13.629 --> 22:15.291
Can you feel this?

22:15.364 --> 22:17.299
Should you be pressing there?

22:17.366 --> 22:19.664
I need to look inside. Wine.

22:19.735 --> 22:21.259
Here.

22:23.571 --> 22:25.630
This will hurt. Are you brave?

22:26.908 --> 22:28.307
Do it.

22:30.112 --> 22:32.773
Keep breathing.

22:34.882 --> 22:37.715
- Good.
- She will be all right?

22:41.188 --> 22:43.156
I need to sew. Give me a needle.

22:47.128 --> 22:50.291
This needle is thick and blunt.

22:50.364 --> 22:53.561
- Are you prepared?
- Is this the way you sell it?

22:54.669 --> 22:56.534
Give it to me.

23:02.475 --> 23:04.033
Ah!

23:06.880 --> 23:11.112
Ho, ho, ho! Look at this! This is great stuff.

23:12.118 --> 23:13.642
The others will be waiting for us.

23:13.720 --> 23:15.847
Yeah.

23:16.923 --> 23:19.118
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

23:19.192 --> 23:20.749
No.

23:20.826 --> 23:23.727
- If you're not thinking it, how do you know?
- I don't think like you do.

23:23.796 --> 23:25.855
I'm not being funny, maybe you should.

23:26.565 --> 23:30.524
What, you think Robin's gonna need us
when he's a lord again? Yeah?

23:30.602 --> 23:34.503
It's all right for them, innit?
Much with his lodge. What are we gonna have?

23:34.572 --> 23:37.337
- This should go to the poor.
- That's us now.

23:38.576 --> 23:42.034
Look, we were outlaws, right? We had a job.

23:42.113 --> 23:44.673
We've got nothing now, we are the poor.

23:46.485 --> 23:49.180
- You know what this is?
- What?

23:49.287 --> 23:51.118
Severance pay.

23:52.457 --> 23:55.688
- All right?
- Yes, thank you, Djaq.

23:55.759 --> 23:58.285
- I'm sorry.
- Why?

23:58.363 --> 24:00.830
I did not think you would be so brave.

24:14.010 --> 24:16.911
Any sign of Allan or Will?
No.

24:18.014 --> 24:23.077
Well, the bad news is you've been stabbed.

24:23.152 --> 24:27.055
But the good news is you don't have
to marry the man that stabbed you.

24:27.124 --> 24:31.060
- And what will happen?
- When the King comes to Nottingham...

24:31.128 --> 24:32.651
I'll make an entrance.

24:32.728 --> 24:35.322
He will let me speak, he trusts me.

24:35.398 --> 24:38.162
I will present the evidence,
the physician will corroborate it,

24:38.267 --> 24:41.293
and... and Gisborne will be done for.

24:41.370 --> 24:42.860
Will he hang?

24:44.306 --> 24:45.772
Yes.

24:46.875 --> 24:50.572
Marian, this is a man
who would force you to marry him.

24:50.678 --> 24:53.146
A man who tried to kill the King,
a man who stabbed you.

24:53.214 --> 24:55.445
Even so, I will never support hanging.

24:58.319 --> 25:00.082
What?

25:01.523 --> 25:03.491
No, tell me.

25:07.729 --> 25:09.754
I think you feel for him.

25:09.863 --> 25:11.422
He's a human being.

25:11.499 --> 25:13.261
Hardly.

25:14.034 --> 25:16.629
- You are stirred by him.
- Stirred?

25:18.338 --> 25:20.238
He said it.

25:20.307 --> 25:22.571
- And he was right, wasn't he?
- Grow up.

25:22.643 --> 25:26.134
Well, this morning when you thought
you had to marry him,

25:26.213 --> 25:28.738
you were happily resigned to your fate.

25:29.817 --> 25:33.844
His... qualities and his genuine feelings.

25:33.921 --> 25:37.084
- I was trying to be brave.
- But why?

25:37.157 --> 25:41.218
- This whole Nightwatchman thing, it's...
- What whole Nightwatchman thing?

25:41.294 --> 25:44.354
I am only doing what you do
but with more intelligence.

25:47.166 --> 25:49.726
You would have thought
you would have learnt by now.

25:49.802 --> 25:54.068
Every time you go out,
you get arrested or stabbed or betrothed.

25:55.474 --> 25:58.444
You should stay at home
and do your embroidery.

26:07.319 --> 26:11.415
- I did not mean that.
- Even my father, who is old and infirm,

26:11.490 --> 26:15.221
and has a lot more to lose than you do,
even he supports me more than you do.

26:15.293 --> 26:17.920
- Ah!
- Marian, you need to sleep.

26:32.076 --> 26:35.273
You think Marian'll want anything to eat?
What is it girls eat?

26:35.346 --> 26:37.439
Special girls ' food.

26:38.482 --> 26:42.680
- You know what I mean.
- Ask her yourself what she wants to eat.

26:42.753 --> 26:46.552
She's still asleep. I gave her a nudge earlier
but she didn't wake up.

26:47.757 --> 26:49.315
Really?

26:49.993 --> 26:51.756
Still?

27:00.203 --> 27:02.171
Marian. Wake up.

27:02.272 --> 27:04.137
You said to let her sleep.

27:04.207 --> 27:07.698
This is not sleeping.
This is her body shutting down.

27:08.744 --> 27:11.441
Gisborne's knife has caused damage inside.
I must open the wound.

27:11.513 --> 27:14.073
Marian! Marian!

27:16.585 --> 27:18.416
I don't feel well.

27:19.288 --> 27:22.553
- I need clean instruments.
- What instruments?

27:22.658 --> 27:25.684
You stay here. Hold her hand. I'll be quick.

27:26.461 --> 27:28.292
Do not let her sleep.

27:29.298 --> 27:31.094
- Marian.
- Mm...

27:31.165 --> 27:33.133
- Marian.
- Mm-hm.

27:34.101 --> 27:35.660
Marian.

27:40.875 --> 27:43.537
- She awake?
- Only just.

27:43.611 --> 27:47.570
Now, does she want an egg
or does she want some bacon?

27:47.682 --> 27:50.014
She can't have both, I don't care who she is.

27:50.083 --> 27:53.076
Pray to your god, and to mine.

27:53.153 --> 27:54.484
She is going to die.

27:57.390 --> 28:01.224
- Die? What do you mean, die?
- Her face.

28:01.294 --> 28:03.956
I have seen that look a thousand times before.

28:04.064 --> 28:05.861
Oh.

28:05.932 --> 28:07.695
Ah. Er...

28:07.767 --> 28:10.167
W- W-What do we do?

28:10.270 --> 28:15.264
I need hot water.
I need clean instruments. Knives.

28:15.342 --> 28:17.866
- Yes, er...
- And here.

28:17.943 --> 28:20.435
Grind this into a fine paste. Now.

28:20.512 --> 28:22.447
Yes. Er, er, now.

28:23.682 --> 28:27.413
I should go home. My father will be worried.

28:27.486 --> 28:29.511
All in good time.

28:29.588 --> 28:32.681
- I am a nuisance.
- Yes, you are.

28:32.757 --> 28:34.725
You were supposed to say no.

28:34.792 --> 28:37.090
And you should be at home
doing your embroidery.

28:37.161 --> 28:40.324
Right, here is the paste,

28:40.399 --> 28:43.424
and, er, the instruments are coming,

28:43.501 --> 28:45.697
and, er, Djaq is...

28:46.371 --> 28:48.464
Djaq is, er, coming, and I'm...

28:48.539 --> 28:50.097
I'm sure... I'm sure of...

28:50.174 --> 28:52.165
I'm sure, I'm sure?

28:52.276 --> 28:53.675
I am sure.

28:53.745 --> 28:56.805
"I am sure" is reassuring.

28:56.881 --> 28:59.543
"I am sure, I am sure" is not.

28:59.651 --> 29:01.619
I am sure.

29:01.686 --> 29:05.746
It's just, er, Djaq is, er, very... er...

29:05.857 --> 29:08.155
Djaq is very what?

29:08.258 --> 29:10.351
- I'll shut up.
- Good idea.

29:10.460 --> 29:12.223
Yeah. I'll go.

29:13.864 --> 29:16.162
Er... drink this.

29:16.266 --> 29:18.063
All of it.

29:20.670 --> 29:22.138
Much.

29:22.205 --> 29:24.173
He means well.

29:25.275 --> 29:27.834
What can Djaq have told him?

29:31.080 --> 29:33.014
This is not good, is it?

29:35.584 --> 29:38.451
Tell me the truth.

29:39.388 --> 29:41.322
Maybe not so good.

29:43.692 --> 29:45.251
Here.

29:53.068 --> 29:54.433
I will cut you open.

29:56.538 --> 29:58.768
If I can find the damage, I will sew it up.

30:00.608 --> 30:03.736
- What are my chances?
- If I do not do this, none.

30:03.845 --> 30:05.745
If I do, very little.

30:09.951 --> 30:12.852
My father treated the wounded
in the battlefield.

30:13.654 --> 30:17.283
He said never lie to a wounded man.

30:17.357 --> 30:20.121
Or was it never lie to a dying man?

30:22.162 --> 30:24.096
He said that too.

30:31.337 --> 30:33.306
So?

30:33.372 --> 30:35.238
Never lie to a dying man.

30:35.309 --> 30:37.243
You are not going to die.

30:38.478 --> 30:42.005
- And I have never lied to you.
- Oh, come on.

30:42.081 --> 30:44.548
We have never once spoken the truth
to each other.

30:44.650 --> 30:46.549
Now is not the time to argue.

30:46.618 --> 30:49.452
Do not tell me when it is the time to argue.

30:49.522 --> 30:52.355
What?

30:52.425 --> 30:54.552
Well, I do not think
there can be much wrong with you.

30:54.627 --> 30:56.561
I am serious.

30:58.730 --> 31:01.893
We have never once spoken the truth
to each other.

31:01.967 --> 31:05.061
For instance, I call you a fool
when I mean you are a hero.

31:06.471 --> 31:10.134
I criticize your actions and then mimic them
myself as the Nightwatchman.

31:12.042 --> 31:14.876
- I chastise Robin Hood...
- Shh.

31:14.945 --> 31:17.881
I will not be shushed,
these might be my last words.

31:19.450 --> 31:21.418
No, they will not be, they cannot be.

31:25.256 --> 31:27.417
Because we should be together.

31:27.491 --> 31:30.324
I should never have left you,
I should never have gone to war.

31:30.394 --> 31:32.258
It was a mistake.

31:33.329 --> 31:35.297
And you were right.

31:35.933 --> 31:37.901
I wanted glory.

31:38.736 --> 31:41.034
But believe me...

31:41.105 --> 31:43.504
the battlefield is the last place you will find it.

31:43.573 --> 31:45.973
You would have always regretted it
if you hadn't gone.

31:46.042 --> 31:48.010
But not as much as I regret going.

31:49.579 --> 31:51.410
Not as much as I regret losing you.

31:53.750 --> 31:57.049
Marian. I should not have gone.

31:57.987 --> 31:59.011
Robin...

31:59.088 --> 32:03.080
I love you, you love me,
we all love each other.

32:03.159 --> 32:04.921
Drink the wine.

32:11.166 --> 32:13.225
Here, lift.

32:16.071 --> 32:17.629
Robin, hold her.

32:26.047 --> 32:28.106
It's too...

32:30.051 --> 32:32.747
- Master?
- Can't reach it without causing further damage.

32:32.855 --> 32:35.948
- Master.
- Robin, press here. Stop the bleeding.

32:41.762 --> 32:44.094
- I cannot!
- What?

32:44.165 --> 32:47.656
I am not trained, I don't have
the right instruments, I can't do it.

32:47.735 --> 32:50.033
- Much, put your finger here.
- Me?

32:50.104 --> 32:52.072
Yes, you. Come on.

32:53.840 --> 32:55.899
- I need to get the physician.
- There is no time.

32:55.976 --> 32:58.069
Ah. Eurgh.

32:58.144 --> 33:00.669
Make me time.
Be quick.

33:00.747 --> 33:02.715
- Here?
- Yes!

33:10.890 --> 33:13.051
Yeah, this is it.

33:13.959 --> 33:16.520
The Great North Road.

33:18.063 --> 33:21.829
So which way are we gonna go?
Back to the cave, or pastures new?

33:21.901 --> 33:25.496
- What if they need our help, the others?
- What for?

33:25.571 --> 33:27.266
They got away.

33:28.540 --> 33:31.805
Where 'd your old man go, and your brother,
when they ran away?

33:31.877 --> 33:35.039
Scarborough. My Auntie Annie.

33:36.749 --> 33:39.046
Well.

33:42.253 --> 33:44.813
I wouldn't mind meeting your Auntie Annie.

33:45.890 --> 33:48.017
What do you reckon?

33:48.092 --> 33:50.060
You know what I was thinking?

33:50.662 --> 33:52.527
I was thinking Robin would want this for us.

33:52.597 --> 33:54.531
He would. He'd want the best for us.

34:21.791 --> 34:25.226
Pitts. Pitts!

34:25.928 --> 34:28.192
Yes, yes, what is it?

34:28.264 --> 34:31.791
I need your help.
A friend of mine has been stabbed. She...

34:32.534 --> 34:35.025
- She is close to death.
- Bring her here.

34:35.103 --> 34:38.596
I cannot. I will take you to her.
I have brought you a horse.

34:38.674 --> 34:42.005
Well, where is she?
I need to know in case anybody...

34:42.077 --> 34:44.045
We must leave now, there is no time.

34:44.112 --> 34:46.306
All right. Let me get my things.

34:51.954 --> 34:54.420
- Hurry up.
- Don't worry, my friend.

34:54.489 --> 34:56.456
Everything is under control.

34:58.827 --> 35:00.089
Psst. Psst.

35:10.238 --> 35:12.206
Hurry. Come on!

35:16.844 --> 35:18.812
Hurry up.

35:20.314 --> 35:22.043
Oh!

35:22.116 --> 35:24.084
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

35:27.720 --> 35:29.120
Bandages.

35:31.624 --> 35:33.252
All right.

35:33.327 --> 35:35.692
Let's see. Yes, yes.

35:47.740 --> 35:49.708
I'm not doing anything,
I'm just pressing, right?

35:49.776 --> 35:52.107
Yes. There 's not much else we can do.

35:52.177 --> 35:54.441
The physician has the instruments.

35:54.514 --> 35:56.481
Should I be able to feel a heartbeat?

35:56.548 --> 35:58.106
Yes.

36:11.696 --> 36:14.425
- What are you doing? You'll hurt her.
- Trust me, Much.

36:14.498 --> 36:16.990
Where she is, she cannot feel a thing.

36:28.546 --> 36:30.410
Oh, come on, come on, Marian.

36:45.228 --> 36:47.093
Yes, yes!

36:47.163 --> 36:49.290
Allah be praised!

36:49.365 --> 36:52.630
- Allah be praised!
- Allah be praised!

36:52.702 --> 36:55.898
- How did you do that?
- Put your finger back in. Now!

36:57.640 --> 37:00.507
This will happen again. Where is the physician?
I cannot do it.

37:01.377 --> 37:03.276
Djaq, Djaq!

37:03.345 --> 37:05.074
Djaq!

37:06.649 --> 37:08.411
Much! John!

37:10.887 --> 37:13.252
- How is she?
- Alive.

37:18.292 --> 37:20.260
You have to save her.

37:21.697 --> 37:24.825
Science is advanced
but we're always in the hands of the Lord.

37:26.634 --> 37:29.262
Here. You give her this.

37:29.337 --> 37:31.897
It's a draught for the surgery.
Put a little on her tongue.

37:38.246 --> 37:40.908
She has a dagger wound near the liver,

37:40.982 --> 37:43.280
a leaking blood vessel, I have sewn it up.

37:43.351 --> 37:45.216
- You've been trained?
- A little.

37:45.286 --> 37:49.016
Good, good. Then you've probably saved her life.

37:49.090 --> 37:51.114
She has saved her life.

37:53.561 --> 37:56.723
If you agree, I can close up the wound.

37:56.796 --> 37:58.354
Very good. Close away.

37:59.366 --> 38:01.357
Do you have clean needle?

38:01.434 --> 38:03.334
Thread? Cloth?

38:03.403 --> 38:04.733
Oh. Yes.

38:22.388 --> 38:24.151
Excuse me.

39:26.983 --> 39:28.644
What have I done?

39:35.691 --> 39:39.319
Much! John! Your weapons, now!

39:39.394 --> 39:40.589
Why?

39:40.663 --> 39:45.258
Unless I am badly mistaken, the Sheriff
and Gisborne will arrive at any moment.

39:45.333 --> 39:47.165
We'll be surrounded.

39:47.269 --> 39:49.396
What? We've gotta run!

39:49.471 --> 39:51.462
We cannot run. I cannot run!

39:52.340 --> 39:56.868
- Marian.
- We do not run.

39:56.945 --> 40:00.573
We are trapped in a cave and surrounded.
We're all gonna die.

40:00.682 --> 40:02.309
Yes.

40:02.384 --> 40:04.079
Oh, Lord.

40:12.192 --> 40:15.389
Allan. Where is Allan?

40:15.496 --> 40:18.056
And Will! Where are they?

40:20.767 --> 40:23.202
I thought if I survived the Holy Land

40:23.270 --> 40:26.136
then I would die by the fire in Locksley,

40:26.206 --> 40:28.470
not in some... forest

40:28.542 --> 40:31.374
in some... poxy, poxy...

40:32.111 --> 40:33.408
- cave!
- Much!

40:33.479 --> 40:34.912
- What?
- Let me think!

40:41.120 --> 40:42.587
You.

40:43.623 --> 40:45.591
What did you think?

40:45.658 --> 40:49.286
That Gisborne did not tell me that one day
somebody might come asking about his alibi?

40:49.361 --> 40:53.491
That we did not have a plan in place
for just this occasion?

40:55.001 --> 40:56.969
The charade is over.

41:01.073 --> 41:03.267
Your friend is dead.

41:04.543 --> 41:06.773
- Dead?
- Dead.

41:21.892 --> 41:23.655
Robin.

41:26.297 --> 41:27.627
I'm sorry.

42:15.611 --> 42:16.942
Marian.

42:18.947 --> 42:20.504
Marian!

42:29.223 --> 42:30.986
Marian.

42:33.361 --> 42:35.329
I love you.

42:38.132 --> 42:40.100
I should have said.

42:41.835 --> 42:43.803
Why did I not say?

42:47.475 --> 42:49.237
I love you.

42:49.342 --> 42:51.401
Marian.

42:51.478 --> 42:53.446
I love you.

42:59.686 --> 43:01.586
Marian.

43:17.470 --> 43:19.597
Robin!

43:19.672 --> 43:24.609
Robin! Come out, come out,
wherever you are!
