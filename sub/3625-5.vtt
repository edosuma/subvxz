Someone saw Serena getting off

00:09.705 --> 00:10.706

00:10.793 --> 00:11.750
I've waited my entire adolescent

00:11.837 --> 00:13.187
life for a date with this girl.

00:13.274 --> 00:14.797
You'd really go out with
some guy you don't know?

00:14.884 --> 00:16.668
Well, you can't be worse
than the guys I do know.

00:16.755 --> 00:18.018
You're going out with Serena

00:18.105 --> 00:20.324
and I'm going
to kiss on the lips.

00:20.411 --> 00:22.500
Who said this
family wasn't cool?

00:22.587 --> 00:25.112
Why is my daughter going
to one of your concerts..

00:25.199 --> 00:26.635
...with your son?

00:26.722 --> 00:28.245
If you wanna be part
of this world, Jenny

00:28.332 --> 00:30.421
you need to decide if all this..

00:31.466 --> 00:32.815
...is worth it.

00:32.902 --> 00:34.338
Look, if you're ready to leave

00:34.425 --> 00:36.340
you tell us, okay?

00:36.427 --> 00:38.342
No matter what mom says.

00:38.429 --> 00:40.736
I would really like
to get out of here.

00:40.823 --> 00:42.520
I did this.

00:42.607 --> 00:45.480
My mom kinda left us
a couple months ago.

00:45.567 --> 00:48.396
[Dan]
My dad and my sister
don't really see that.

00:48.483 --> 00:50.528
I dated a girl like Serena once.

00:50.615 --> 00:52.922
Your wife would not want
this hanging in my house.

00:53.009 --> 00:54.184
She doesn't do
background checks

00:54.271 --> 00:56.230
on prospective buyers
and neither do I.

00:56.317 --> 00:58.232
Besides, it's been
almost 20 years.

00:58.319 --> 00:59.276
And you still don't know women.

01:00.582 --> 01:03.063
Hey, how about you
ask me out again?

01:03.150 --> 01:04.586
How about you
actually show up?

01:04.673 --> 01:05.804
Okay.

01:05.891 --> 01:08.111
No drama, no disruptions,
I promise.

01:08.198 --> 01:10.461
Promise? Oh, no! That means
it's never gonna happen now.

01:10.548 --> 01:12.898
Ah! Okay, quick.
I take it back. I un-promise.

01:32.135 --> 01:34.355
to close up the family

01:34.442 --> 01:36.792
Blair is free to focus
on the most important event

01:36.879 --> 01:40.230
of the fall,
her annual sleepover.

01:40.317 --> 01:42.798
A tradition since the year 2000

01:42.885 --> 01:45.757

than the last.

Hey, dad. I'm headed
to the bank.

02:10.608 --> 02:11.566
You want me to deposit the check

02:11.653 --> 02:13.829

Did you knock over

No, this is the entire contents

02:17.659 --> 02:19.965

have a piggy bank

to break Donatello open.

So tonight's the big night, huh?

02:27.190 --> 02:29.105
It is, and I have it
all planned.

02:29.192 --> 02:31.629
Six pounds of plan, actually.

02:31.716 --> 02:32.935
I know it's been
a while since I took

02:33.022 --> 02:34.589
someone on a date, but, uh

02:34.676 --> 02:35.981
movie ticket prices haven't

02:36.068 --> 02:37.157
risen that much, have they?

Dad, this is
Serena van der Woodsen.

02:38.984 --> 02:40.508
I can't just
take her to a movie.

02:40.595 --> 02:42.814

Dad, that's mom's first sale.

02:54.957 --> 02:57.089
That painting sold days ago.
It's kind of a huge deal.

02:57.177 --> 02:58.743
I know, which is why
I was thinking

02:58.830 --> 03:01.616
of surprising her myself,
heading upstate to Hudson

03:01.703 --> 03:03.879
bringing her
the check in person.

What? Aren't I supposed to
deliver good news in person?

03:07.143 --> 03:08.710
I think that's bad news.

03:08.797 --> 03:11.191
Good news might just be
fine with a phone call.

03:11.278 --> 03:14.498
So you're sayin'...
I shouldn't go see her?

03:14.585 --> 03:17.762
I'm saying, uh, I don't think
mom is a huge fan of surprises.

tell me where we're going.

room for surprise, do you?

Well, I don't know
how to dress for surprise.

Not everything goes
with it, you know.

is actually a human being

time and attention?

- No offense.
- None taken.

but this date is unbreakable.

later or something

along the way

you could come home,
not that you should.

I don't wanna argue about this.

- I need time to think.
- Please.

under advisement.

walk out of here anyway.

06:32.653 --> 06:35.612
If you still think
I'm keeping you here

06:35.699 --> 06:38.310

ready you are to come home.

She's 14.

27:05.145 --> 27:06.276
- 14?
- 14?

27:06.363 --> 27:07.843
Jesus. No, I swear
I had no idea, baby.

27:07.930 --> 27:09.715
I mean, look at her.
I mean, she's jailbait.

27:09.802 --> 27:12.152
- What, what's that?
- Dan, stay out of it, okay?

27:12.239 --> 27:13.501
You're just causing more
problems than you're solving.

27:13.588 --> 27:14.894
Only thing causing a problem

27:14.981 --> 27:16.156
is the cocktail
napkin you're wearing.

27:16.243 --> 27:17.374
That's what
I'm talking about.

27:17.461 --> 27:18.593
You're not
talking about anything.

27:18.680 --> 27:20.769
- Dan!
- Hey!

27:20.856 --> 27:22.815
Alright, all of you out
before I call the cops.

27:22.902 --> 27:24.643
- Alright, alright.
- Hey, Serena.

27:24.730 --> 27:26.122
See? I told you
everything was okay.

27:26.209 --> 27:27.907
- 'Let's go, come on.'
- Eric, come on.

27:27.994 --> 27:31.214
Spotted. Big brother
to the not-quite rescue.

27:31.301 --> 27:33.652
Too bad no one told him
you can't save a damsel

27:33.739 --> 27:35.654
if she loves her distress.

27:38.178 --> 27:39.614
Mmm.

27:41.529 --> 27:43.139
- What's wrong with the sauce?
- Oh, nothing.

27:43.226 --> 27:45.446
I'm just so happy
to have a home-cooked meal.

27:45.533 --> 27:48.101
- It just needs a little salt.
- What? It's perfect.

27:48.188 --> 27:50.494
No, just a, just a pinch.

27:50.581 --> 27:53.367
You haven't changed a bit. You
always have to be in control.

27:53.454 --> 27:57.676
Hmm. Well, I don't
remember you complaining.

27:57.763 --> 28:00.113
Well, I wasn't allowed to.
It was one of your rules.

28:00.200 --> 28:02.724
Yeah, well, I may hold
the reins a little tight

28:02.811 --> 28:06.467
but life is complicated,
especially once you have kids.

28:06.554 --> 28:08.948
You know, when they're little,
you're their whole world.

28:09.035 --> 28:12.429
And then one day,
the wall goes up..

28:12.516 --> 28:15.258
...and you're on one side
and they're on the other.

28:15.345 --> 28:16.564
Well, they don't
like to admit it

28:16.651 --> 28:18.087
but they want us
to break through.

28:18.174 --> 28:19.480
Yeah, well,
maybe Serena.

28:19.567 --> 28:21.700
'But Eric, I don't
know what he wants.'

28:21.787 --> 28:23.353
You're awfully concerned
about a 14-year-old boy

28:23.440 --> 28:25.312
breaking curfew.

28:25.399 --> 28:28.141
Well, it's not my
curfew he's breaking.

28:28.228 --> 28:30.404
He's been staying
at the Ostroff Center.

28:30.491 --> 28:33.015
- Ostroff Center?
- Mm-hmm. Yeah.

28:33.102 --> 28:34.930
Is it drugs? Drinking?

28:35.017 --> 28:36.671
Um, no,
he's not a bad kid.

28:36.758 --> 28:38.804
He's just, just, um..

28:38.891 --> 28:40.022
...a lonely one.

28:40.109 --> 28:41.937
It's depression?

28:42.024 --> 28:43.112
Is it bad?

28:43.199 --> 28:45.114
Bad enough to try
to kill himself.

28:52.600 --> 28:54.689
- I'm sorry.
- No, I don't know why.

28:54.776 --> 28:57.648
I don't know...what I
did or I didn't do, but..

28:59.346 --> 29:01.000
...I just don't know
what to do to..

29:01.087 --> 29:03.611
...to make sure
it doesn't happen again.

29:03.698 --> 29:04.873
All you can do
is be there for them.

29:04.960 --> 29:06.222
[phone ringing]

29:06.309 --> 29:08.529
Ah, I hope that's
Dan or Serena.

29:09.617 --> 29:11.010
Hello?

29:11.097 --> 29:12.838
Hey, great.

29:14.361 --> 29:15.884
Uh, yeah.

29:15.971 --> 29:19.105
Actually, I can tell her.
His mother's here with me.

29:19.192 --> 29:21.585
[chuckles]
It's a long story.

29:21.672 --> 29:23.587
Sounds good. Take care.

29:23.674 --> 29:25.589
So he's with Dan and Serena.

29:25.676 --> 29:28.070
And everyone's fine.

29:28.157 --> 29:29.637
Alright, I should go meet them.

29:29.724 --> 29:31.291
- I'll wrap this up.
- 'No. You know what?'

29:31.378 --> 29:32.466
This isn't gonna travel well.

29:32.553 --> 29:33.946
Why don't I just..

29:34.033 --> 29:36.122
...stay here,
and I can eat it quickly?

29:36.209 --> 29:37.253
It would be a shame

29:37.340 --> 29:39.081
to let it go to waste.

29:40.082 --> 29:41.649
[indistinct chattering]

29:41.736 --> 29:43.869
- What were you thinking?
- 'He was bored.'

29:43.956 --> 29:45.522
He wanted to get out
and have some fun.

29:45.609 --> 29:46.741
So you took him to a bar?

29:46.828 --> 29:48.525
He didn't do anything wrong.

29:48.612 --> 29:50.266
- I thought you'd be happy.
- Well, I'm not, okay?

29:50.353 --> 29:52.616
I-I, I can't believe
that you did this.

29:52.703 --> 29:54.793
Hey, I wasn't kidnapped, Serena.

29:54.880 --> 29:56.142
I left of my own free will.

29:56.229 --> 29:58.100
Blair was trying
to...do me a favor.

29:58.187 --> 30:00.102
- Told you.
- Well, it's no favor, Eric.

30:00.189 --> 30:03.105
- You're in a lot of trouble.
- Yeah, I know.

30:03.192 --> 30:05.325
And you know what,
it was worth it.

30:05.412 --> 30:06.979
To be out after dark,
and to talk to someone

30:07.066 --> 30:09.808
who isn't just you or mom,
even if it is Blair.

30:09.895 --> 30:12.071
- No offense.
- None taken.

30:12.158 --> 30:15.117
Well, I'm sorry
this was the only way.

30:16.597 --> 30:18.904
We'll work on mom, okay?

30:18.991 --> 30:20.079
Thanks.

30:20.166 --> 30:21.428
And since she knows
you're okay

30:21.515 --> 30:24.344
I guess there's no
real reason to rush.

30:24.431 --> 30:25.693
How about we walk?

30:25.780 --> 30:27.782
Ugh, call me.

30:27.869 --> 30:29.044
Yeah, I will.

30:29.131 --> 30:30.350
I was talking to Eric.

30:30.437 --> 30:31.481
[chuckling]

30:31.568 --> 30:32.569
What is wrong with you?

30:32.656 --> 30:34.093
This is not who you are.

30:34.180 --> 30:35.964
And who are you
right now? Dad?

30:36.051 --> 30:37.052
Alright, we are not
doing this right now.

30:37.139 --> 30:38.401
We can do this at home.
Let's go.

30:38.488 --> 30:39.663
Except I'm not going home.

30:39.750 --> 30:41.230
I'm going with my friends.

30:41.317 --> 30:42.710
[Blair]
'Coming, Jenny?'

30:44.103 --> 30:45.321
Yeah! One second!

30:46.801 --> 30:47.976
Look, alright,
I'm sorry that things

30:48.063 --> 30:49.021
got out of hand tonight.

30:49.108 --> 30:50.196
To say the least.

30:50.283 --> 30:52.938
I know who Blair
and those girls are.

30:53.025 --> 30:54.896
But I know who I am.

30:54.983 --> 30:56.202
And I'm not gonna forget that

30:56.289 --> 30:57.290
just 'cause I
hang out with them.

30:57.377 --> 30:59.379
Come on! We're leaving!

30:59.466 --> 31:00.989
I'm comin'!

31:03.600 --> 31:05.515
But just let me go. Please?

31:05.602 --> 31:06.734
I mean, look, I'll be tucked

31:06.821 --> 31:07.822
in bed in a half-hour.

31:07.909 --> 31:09.345
I promise.

31:11.173 --> 31:12.522
[chuckles]

31:12.609 --> 31:13.610
Uh, alright, alright

31:13.697 --> 31:14.655
alright, yeah, go ahead.

31:14.742 --> 31:15.743
Thank you.

31:17.658 --> 31:19.486
- Hey.
- Hey.

31:19.573 --> 31:21.880
I, uh, I gotta take him
back to the center.

31:21.967 --> 31:24.143
So we should probably
just call it a night.

31:24.230 --> 31:25.622
What? No, no, no.
I'll go with you.

31:25.709 --> 31:27.363
No, it's okay.
You don't have to.

31:27.450 --> 31:29.235
I want to.

31:29.322 --> 31:30.671
Come on. Let's go.

31:34.849 --> 31:36.198
This just in.

31:36.285 --> 31:38.592
Truth or dare
has gone into overtime.

31:38.679 --> 31:40.289
Looks like no one told Little J

31:40.376 --> 31:42.770
you don't beat a Waldorf
at her own game.

31:42.857 --> 31:45.033
[Jenny]
You want me to steal
the jacket from the mannequin?

31:45.120 --> 31:46.252
That's right.

31:46.339 --> 31:47.731
Blair, it's your mom's store.

31:47.818 --> 31:50.038
I mean, you could
have anything you want.

31:50.125 --> 31:51.648
So can you.

31:51.735 --> 31:52.867
Unless you don't want to.

31:52.954 --> 31:54.608
Which is totally understandable.

31:54.695 --> 31:56.392
And I wouldn't
judge you for that.

31:56.479 --> 31:57.437
I don't get it.

31:57.524 --> 31:59.134
Then you don't have to do it.

31:59.221 --> 32:00.919
It's just a shame,
'cause you've come so far.

32:05.358 --> 32:06.837
The jacket?

32:06.925 --> 32:08.665
Just the jacket.

32:11.059 --> 32:13.322
[chuckles]

32:13.409 --> 32:14.671
Oh, God.

32:18.632 --> 32:20.503
[laughing]

32:25.987 --> 32:28.729
Five...four..

32:28.816 --> 32:30.165
...three..

32:30.252 --> 32:32.515
...two...one.

32:32.602 --> 32:33.995
'Okay, come on, run.'

32:36.737 --> 32:39.653
[siren wailing]

32:40.523 --> 32:42.003
Guys! Come back!

32:42.090 --> 32:43.657
Let me out!

32:43.744 --> 32:46.660
[siren wailing]

32:51.665 --> 32:53.362
[instrumental music]

32:53.449 --> 32:54.407
[chuckles]

32:54.494 --> 32:55.712
Oh.

32:55.799 --> 32:57.149
Are you still the same guy

32:57.236 --> 32:59.107
you were when I took this photo?

32:59.194 --> 33:00.456
[Rufus]
'What? You took that photo?'

33:00.543 --> 33:02.284
You weren't even
at that show.

33:02.371 --> 33:03.938
Oh, excuse me.

33:04.025 --> 33:06.897
If I remember,
the first song was about me.

33:06.985 --> 33:10.727
The second one was about...
your motorcycle.

33:10.814 --> 33:13.556
And then there was the one about
that surf town. What was it?

33:13.643 --> 33:14.862
Sayulita.

33:14.949 --> 33:17.517
- Sayulita.
- Fishermen's town.

33:17.604 --> 33:19.823
Was that the one
with the villa where we..

33:21.912 --> 33:24.480
Yes, indeed, it was.

33:24.567 --> 33:26.787
God, I must have taken
eight rolls of film that night.

33:26.874 --> 33:29.268
W-why did you give up
photography anyway?

33:29.355 --> 33:32.097
'You loved it so much.'

33:32.184 --> 33:33.924
Well, I guess I figured, um

33:34.012 --> 33:35.926
social climbing
would be more fulfilling.

33:37.493 --> 33:40.279
I even remember the black dress
I wore that night.

33:40.366 --> 33:42.237
- Really?
- Yeah.

33:42.324 --> 33:44.631
You know, I think it may
have actually been blue.

33:44.718 --> 33:47.025
I thought you said you didn't
remember me being there.

33:48.330 --> 33:50.071
[phone ringing]

33:50.158 --> 33:51.203
Uh, can you grab that, Lil?

33:51.290 --> 33:52.813
And if it's my son..

33:52.900 --> 33:54.771
...be nice to him.

33:56.034 --> 33:58.340
Hello, Humphrey residence.

33:59.950 --> 34:01.909
Hi, Alison.

34:01.996 --> 34:04.303
'Yeah, it's, um, Lily.'

34:05.826 --> 34:07.654
Yeah, h-hold on just..

34:08.829 --> 34:09.786
Alison?

34:09.873 --> 34:12.050
[line disconnects]

34:15.923 --> 34:18.230
Looks like you're gonna
have some explaining to do.

34:18.317 --> 34:21.320
Trust me, I don't owe Alison
any explanation right now.

34:21.407 --> 34:23.365
You know what,
I've overstayed my welcome.

34:23.452 --> 34:27.761
[Rufus]
Okay. I hope everything
turns out alright.

34:27.848 --> 34:29.154
Yeah, me too.

34:29.241 --> 34:31.417
Thanks for babysitting me.

34:31.504 --> 34:33.506
And thank you for being
such a good friend.

34:34.855 --> 34:36.378
Yeah.

34:36.465 --> 34:38.337
It was almost fun.

34:45.692 --> 34:47.563
'Goodnight, Rufus.'

34:49.043 --> 34:50.349
[indistinct chattering on radio]

34:50.436 --> 34:51.480
I'm gonna need you
to show me some

34:51.567 --> 34:53.265
form of identification, miss.

34:53.352 --> 34:56.224
I'm only 14. I don't have any.

34:56.311 --> 34:59.271
What are you doing
out at this hour?

34:59.358 --> 35:01.229
- I..
- What's your name?

35:05.059 --> 35:06.669
My name is Blair Waldorf.

35:06.756 --> 35:07.931
This is my mother's shop.

35:08.018 --> 35:09.455
Her name is Eleanor.

35:09.542 --> 35:11.021
I left my jacket here earlier

35:11.109 --> 35:13.763
I mean, which irritates
my mother to no end.

35:13.850 --> 35:16.201
And I completely
forgot about the alarm.

35:16.288 --> 35:17.550
Alright, what's your
home phone number

35:17.637 --> 35:18.638
so we can call her?

35:18.725 --> 35:20.205
Oh, she's not home.

35:20.292 --> 35:22.250
I mean, she's in Paris
until Thursday.

35:22.337 --> 35:24.165
It's six hours ahead
if you want to call.

35:24.252 --> 35:26.950
[sighs]
She's gonna be so angry.

35:27.037 --> 35:28.300
Well, look, we
can't just let you go

35:28.387 --> 35:30.128
without confirming
your story.

35:30.215 --> 35:32.130
I have my own set of keys.

35:33.348 --> 35:35.133
You can watch me lock up.

35:41.443 --> 35:43.663
Well, I can see why your
brother would wanna leave.

35:43.750 --> 35:46.405
That place is, uh,
is very depressing.

35:46.492 --> 35:49.538
And yet, it's designed
to treat depression.

35:49.625 --> 35:51.627
He's a good kid,
Eric. He is.

35:51.714 --> 35:54.456
Yeah. Jenny's not
so bad either.

35:54.543 --> 35:55.544
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

35:55.631 --> 35:58.417
Yeah, I-I-I know. I know.

35:58.504 --> 36:00.419
I just worry
about her sometimes.

36:00.506 --> 36:02.290
Well, worry looks cute on you.

36:02.377 --> 36:03.465
[chuckles]

36:03.552 --> 36:04.901
Look, I've seen Jenny in action

36:04.988 --> 36:06.686
and my hunch is
she doesn't let herself

36:06.773 --> 36:08.340
