00:54.000 --> 01:01.000
Who will rescue me

01:37.500 --> 01:44.900
Oh, who will rescue me

01:46.800 --> 01:53.000
Who will rescue me

03:07.400 --> 03:09.500
I'm lost at sea

03:09.500 --> 03:13.000
Without a friend

03:17.100 --> 03:18.900
This journey

03:18.800 --> 03:22.700
Will it ever end

03:25.600 --> 03:29.100
Who will

03:29.100 --> 03:33.000
Rescue

03:32.900 --> 03:42.900
Me

03:45.200 --> 03:49.200
Rescue me

03:52.100 --> 03:59.300
Rescue me

04:48.200 --> 04:53.500
Attention, please.
The economic and social council
will convene in five minutes.

05:24.500 --> 05:25.900
G-Good day, sir.

05:26.900 --> 05:28.700
G-Good day, Mr. Ambassador.

05:29.900 --> 05:33.700
How do you do, madam?

05:33.600 --> 05:36.100
Order. Order.
This emergency meeting...

05:36.100 --> 05:39.700
of the International Rescue Aid Society
is now in session.

05:39.600 --> 05:43.600
Delegates, you have been summoned
from all corners of the globe...

05:43.500 --> 05:47.600
because we have reason to believe
that someone is in distress.

05:47.600 --> 05:53.100
As you know, our society has never
failed to answer a call for help.

05:54.400 --> 05:56.200
Hear! Hear!

05:56.100 --> 06:01.200
We will face the portrait of the beloved
founder of our society, Euripides Mouse.

06:02.000 --> 06:04.900
Delegates, hands over hearts.

06:11.500 --> 06:14.600

Heads held high
Touch the sky

06:21.800 --> 06:26.300
You mean everything to me

06:26.100 --> 06:29.700
In a fix, in a bind
Call on us anytime

06:29.600 --> 06:33.200
We'll appear from nowhere
Mighty are we

06:33.200 --> 06:36.900
R-E-S-C-U-E

06:36.700 --> 06:40.100

Touch the sky

06:49.700 --> 06:54.300
You mean everything to me

06:54.100 --> 06:57.500
In a jam, in a scrape
And you think no escape

06:57.400 --> 07:01.200
Do not fear, we'll be here
Courageous are we

07:10.800 --> 07:16.400

07:18.600 --> 07:22.500
Mouse scouts,
bring in the bottle.

07:29.700 --> 07:32.200
Mr. Bernard, if you please.

07:38.500 --> 07:41.400
C-C-Coming through.
Uh, pardon me.

07:42.400 --> 07:44.900
Have a care there.

07:44.900 --> 07:48.200
I'm, uh-- I'm sorry.
Uh-- Excuse me, sir.

07:48.100 --> 07:50.400
- Oops.
- Egad!

07:52.600 --> 07:54.900
Delegates, this is
no time for levity.

07:54.800 --> 07:57.500
Serious business, you know.
Serious business.

08:05.100 --> 08:06.800
Now what?

08:06.800 --> 08:11.000
Sir, there, uh-- there-- there are
1 3 steps on this ladder.

08:10.900 --> 08:13.800
Oh, superstitious nonsense.

08:29.600 --> 08:32.799
What next?

08:32.700 --> 08:35.400
Oh, um, sorry, sir.

08:35.299 --> 08:38.400
I'll, uh-- I'll have it--
have it out in-in a jiffy, sir.

08:53.100 --> 08:57.600
''To Morningside Orphanage, New York.''

08:57.500 --> 09:00.900
It's difficult to decipher.
I can't make it out.

09:02.800 --> 09:05.400
''I am...

09:05.300 --> 09:08.300
in terrible...

09:09.100 --> 09:12.000
terrible trouble.''

09:11.900 --> 09:15.400
Oh, oh, dear,
it's all watered out.

09:15.400 --> 09:16.900
''Hurry.

09:16.800 --> 09:19.300
Help. Penny.''

09:19.300 --> 09:23.300
Penny?
Morningside Orphanage?

09:23.200 --> 09:26.000
Dash it all.
It's not much to go on, is it?

09:26.000 --> 09:29.100
Oh. Oh, that poor little girl.

09:29.100 --> 09:31.900
Oh, Mr. Chairman, please...

09:31.800 --> 09:35.100
please, may I have this assignment?

09:35.000 --> 09:38.900
You, Miss Bianca?

09:38.800 --> 09:42.400
Dear lady, it's absolutely
without precedent.

09:42.400 --> 09:47.100
I mean, it's not like the old days
when it was a man's world.

09:47.000 --> 09:51.800
However, I suppose
there has to be a first time.

09:51.700 --> 09:53.900
Uh, uh, Mr. Chairman, sir.

09:53.900 --> 09:58.600
I-I-I don't think Miss Bianca
should go. It could be dangerous.

09:58.500 --> 10:01.600
I mean, I mean, any--
anything could-- could happen to her.

10:03.300 --> 10:08.100
You see, dear lady,
before our janitor interrupted...

10:08.000 --> 10:12.400
I was about to suggest that
you should have a co-agent go with you.

10:12.300 --> 10:14.800
Gentlemen, who will volunteer?

10:17.400 --> 10:23.300
Gentlemen, this is indeed a--
a most difficult decision to make.

10:27.500 --> 10:29.500
I choose...

10:29.500 --> 10:32.500
Mr. Bernard
to be my co-agent.

10:33.900 --> 10:38.500
M-Me? Oh, th-that's--
that's really very, uh--

10:38.300 --> 10:42.400
No, uh, see, I'm-- I'm--
I'm a-- I'm only a-a-a ja-janitor.

10:42.300 --> 10:46.300
Oh, come on.
We'll be a great team together.

10:46.300 --> 10:48.100
Oh, come on!

10:48.100 --> 10:50.000
Bravo! Bravo!

10:53.500 --> 10:57.600
Ajanitor, my lady?
Oh, good heavens. Bless my soul.

11:20.500 --> 11:22.800
Morningside Orphanage.

11:22.800 --> 11:25.100
Here. H-Here it is.

11:25.000 --> 11:27.300
Three blocks down and...

11:27.300 --> 11:30.100
uh, uh, four blocks over.

11:30.000 --> 11:32.800
Well, why don't we take
the shortcut through the zoo?

11:32.800 --> 11:36.400
Uh, gee, uh, Miss Bianca, uh--

11:36.400 --> 11:39.200
I-I don't know. I mean, it's--
you know, it could be risky.

11:39.000 --> 11:41.800
Oh, come on.
Remember our pledge?

11:41.800 --> 11:44.900
Through storm and rain
and dark of night--

11:44.800 --> 11:47.200
Never fail to do what's right.

11:48.700 --> 11:52.400
All right, duty calls.

12:08.900 --> 12:12.200
Uh, Mr. Bernard, um,
maybe we'd better go back.

12:12.900 --> 12:15.600
It's so dark in there.

12:15.600 --> 12:17.900
Dark?

12:17.900 --> 12:21.300
Who's a--
Who's afraid of the dark?

12:21.300 --> 12:26.000
Look, you, uh--y-you stay here.
I'll-- I'll check it out.

12:42.100 --> 12:44.400
Wait for me!

13:03.500 --> 13:08.200
How-- How about trying, uh, three blocks
down and, uh, four blocks over?

13:09.400 --> 13:12.100
What did you do
to make him so mad?

13:14.100 --> 13:17.300
Nothing. He's just a--
just a grumpy old lion.

13:17.300 --> 13:21.200
Well, after all, waking him up
in the middle of the night--

13:21.000 --> 13:24.300
Wouldn't you be grumpy too?

13:24.300 --> 13:26.500
I didn't wake him up
in the middle of the night.

13:26.500 --> 13:29.600
I was walking through the thing,
and he just--

13:54.800 --> 13:59.100
I'll, uh-- I'll take a look around,
see what I can find.

14:14.100 --> 14:16.400
Miss, uh-- Miss Bianca, over here.
I-I found something.

14:17.300 --> 14:20.300
- These are Penny's belongings.
- Good work.

14:20.300 --> 14:24.000
Now we're getting somewhere.

14:23.900 --> 14:27.100
Oh, look.
The little girl's treasures.

14:28.600 --> 14:31.200
Boy, the things kids collect.

14:31.200 --> 14:34.100
Do you think she could be
still here in the orphanage?

14:34.100 --> 14:37.900
Well, s-she can't be. It says
on the box, ''Hold until further notice.''

14:37.700 --> 14:40.000
Well, maybe she's been adopted.

14:39.900 --> 14:43.400
No, because she would've
taken these things with her.

14:43.400 --> 14:46.400
- Mice!
- Cat!

14:46.300 --> 14:48.900
Now, lookee here, you two...

14:48.800 --> 14:51.900
if folks find out
that mice moved in here...

14:51.900 --> 14:54.600
I-I'll get kicked out,
lose my job.

14:54.600 --> 14:59.400
Oh, d-don't worry, Mr. Cat.
We won't be here long.

15:00.500 --> 15:04.200
I'm a mite too old
to be chasin' mice.

15:04.200 --> 15:09.100
Uh, sir, could--
could you tell us what happened
to a little girl named Penny?

15:09.000 --> 15:13.000
I sure can. But you ain't
gonna find her around here.

15:12.900 --> 15:16.500
The poor little thing
ran away.

15:16.400 --> 15:19.000
When-- When was the last time
you saw Penny?

15:19.000 --> 15:22.700
Was there anything unusual?
Try to remember.

15:22.700 --> 15:24.800
Let's see now. Uh--

15:24.700 --> 15:27.600
The last time I saw her...

15:27.500 --> 15:32.500
she was sittin' over there
on her bed, all alone.

15:32.300 --> 15:36.400
She looked awful sad,
and so I asked her--

15:36.300 --> 15:39.000
What's wrong, Penny honey?

15:38.800 --> 15:40.900
Nothing.

15:40.800 --> 15:44.100
Oh, come on, now.
Come on. No secrets.

15:44.100 --> 15:46.400
You tell old Rufus, huh?

15:46.400 --> 15:50.900
Well, it was adoption day
at the orphanage.

15:50.800 --> 15:53.000
Well, what happened?

15:53.000 --> 15:56.100
A man and a lady came
and looked at me...

15:56.100 --> 15:58.600
but they choosed
a little redheaded girl.

15:59.300 --> 16:01.700
She was prettier than me.

16:01.700 --> 16:05.200
Oh! Sh-She couldn't be!

16:05.100 --> 16:08.200
Y-You listen to me, darlin'.

16:08.100 --> 16:11.000
You're something extra special.

16:10.900 --> 16:12.700
No, I'm not.

16:12.600 --> 16:16.300
Why, someday a mama and a papa
will come to the orphanage...

16:16.200 --> 16:20.200
looking for a pretty little girl
just like you.

16:20.100 --> 16:24.100
- Honest?
- I'll bet my whiskers on it.

16:24.000 --> 16:26.800
But you've got to believe it.

16:26.800 --> 16:28.700
Keep the faith, sweetheart.

16:30.100 --> 16:33.100
- Do you see that bluebird?
- Yes, I do.

16:33.000 --> 16:37.300
Well, faith is a bluebird...

16:37.300 --> 16:39.300
you see from afar.

16:39.300 --> 16:43.700
It's for real, and as sure
as the first evening star.

16:43.600 --> 16:46.500
You can't touch it or buy it
or wrap it up tight...

16:46.400 --> 16:48.900
but it's there just the same...

16:48.900 --> 16:51.200
making things turn out right.

16:51.200 --> 16:55.000
Can't touch it or buy it
or wrap it up tight...

16:55.000 --> 17:00.900
but it's there just the same,
making things turn out right.

17:00.600 --> 17:04.400
But whoever adopts me
has to adopt Teddy too.

17:05.300 --> 17:07.500
Oh, they'll love him.

17:07.500 --> 17:10.500
He doesn't eat much, does he?

17:10.500 --> 17:14.599
Oh, here!
I brought you something.

17:15.800 --> 17:19.599
Land o' Goshen! Catnip snaps!

17:19.599 --> 17:22.700
No! They're ginger snaps!

17:25.099 --> 17:29.100
Well, an old codger like me
could use a little ginger.

17:30.800 --> 17:35.000
I taked two extra ones
for lunch today.

17:34.800 --> 17:38.500
We're not supposed to do that.

17:38.400 --> 17:42.900
Well, you can trust me.
I won't tattletale on you.

17:42.700 --> 17:45.300
I love you, Rufus.

17:48.600 --> 17:51.900
Gee, we'd better hurry,
or we'll be late for supper!

17:56.700 --> 18:00.200
She seemed happy enough,
but the next thing I heard...

18:00.200 --> 18:01.800
Penny was gone.

18:01.800 --> 18:04.300
Well, aren't-- aren't the police
still looking for her?

18:04.300 --> 18:08.200
No, no, no, no.
They-- They gave up weeks ago.

18:08.100 --> 18:12.300
Oh, this is terrible.
That poor little girl.

18:12.300 --> 18:15.300
I just can't believe
that Penny would run away.

18:15.100 --> 18:18.900
Uh, Mr. Rufus, please think.
Now, there must be something else.

18:18.900 --> 18:24.000
Well, come to think of it,
there was.

18:23.700 --> 18:27.900
Oh, no, no, it's-- it's nothing.
Penny wouldn't get in with her.

18:27.900 --> 18:30.800
Get in what? W-With who?

18:30.600 --> 18:33.800
Oh, a weird lady
tried to give Penny a ride...

18:33.800 --> 18:37.200
but she wouldn't have anything to do
with trashy people like them.

18:37.200 --> 18:39.200
Trashy people? Who?

18:39.200 --> 18:43.200
She and her partner run
a sleazy pawn shop down the street.

18:43.100 --> 18:46.700
Miss Bianca, we must
go down there and investigate.

18:46.600 --> 18:51.400
Suit yourself, but you'd be
wasting your time going down there.

18:51.200 --> 18:55.000
She could be in real trouble.
We gotta find her and help her.

18:55.000 --> 18:59.600
Yeah, but two little mice.
What-- What can you do?

19:49.200 --> 19:53.500
Bernard, uh, a child's book!

19:57.300 --> 19:59.100
It's Penny's!

19:59.100 --> 20:01.200
Then, uh--
Then she's gotta be here.

20:07.300 --> 20:09.400
W-What's so funny?

20:09.400 --> 20:11.300
Y-Your tail!

20:12.500 --> 20:15.100
Here, here,
let me help you fix it.

20:27.100 --> 20:31.200
Who could be ringing
at this time of night?

20:31.000 --> 20:34.300
Madame Medusa's
Pawn Shop Boutique.

20:34.200 --> 20:36.100
- Hello, boss.
- Snoops!

20:36.100 --> 20:40.600
Don't tell me, Snoops.
Let me guess. You found it!

20:40.500 --> 20:43.300
You've found the diamond!

20:44.800 --> 20:47.300
Give you time?

20:47.300 --> 20:49.000
You bungler!

20:48.900 --> 20:52.300
You have been down there
for three months.

20:54.400 --> 20:57.800
Bottles? What bottles?

20:59.300 --> 21:04.500
You caught Penny
sending messages in bottles?

21:04.300 --> 21:06.800
You blundering fool!

21:06.800 --> 21:10.300
Can't you control a little girl?

21:10.300 --> 21:14.600
Shut up! I am taking the next
flight down to Devil's Bayou!

21:20.900 --> 21:24.500
This is terrible.
We've got to go with her.

21:24.400 --> 21:27.200
Yeah, come on.
In the suitcase.

21:34.000 --> 21:38.600
Bumbling boob.
He fouls up everything.

21:38.500 --> 21:41.500
Leave him for a few weeks and--

21:48.600 --> 21:53.200
Oh, why won't this
stupid thing close?

22:32.600 --> 22:36.300
Out of my way, you road hog!

22:58.600 --> 23:02.200
All passengers,
please report for flight 6 1 4.

23:02.100 --> 23:06.300
Hurry-- Hurry, Miss Bianca! Medusa could
be down at the Devil's Bayou by now.

23:06.300 --> 23:12.200
Oh, I'm sorry, but-- but a lady does
have to pack a few things, you know.

23:12.000 --> 23:15.800
Will Mr.Jenkins report
to the ticket counter, please?

23:30.500 --> 23:36.400
All passengers, please report
for flight 6 1 4, now departing.

24:06.100 --> 24:08.500
Flight leaves 6:45.

24:08.500 --> 24:10.500
Oh, no, we missed the flight.

24:12.100 --> 24:15.600
- Miss Bianca, if you hadn't--
- You worry too much.

24:15.600 --> 24:17.800
You know that flights
are always late.

24:17.800 --> 24:21.600
Albatross Flight 1 3 to Tower.
Albatross 1 3.

24:21.500 --> 24:25.400
Now, what did I tell you?
We are lucky, Mr. Bernard.

24:25.400 --> 24:28.300
Luck? Flight 1 3?

24:29.800 --> 24:31.900
Maybe we'd better take the train.

24:31.800 --> 24:33.300
Wake up.!

24:33.300 --> 24:36.400
Dad-rad it.! Somebody answer down there.!
Get off the dime.!

24:36.400 --> 24:39.600
Hello.! Hello.!
Is there anybody down there?

24:39.500 --> 24:42.200
Uh, h-h-hello?

24:42.200 --> 24:44.800
Where have you been,
oh,you lazy knucklehead?

24:44.700 --> 24:46.900
W-We-We just got here, sir.

24:46.800 --> 24:50.500
Uh, uh, see, my co-agent
insisted on packing her, uh--

24:50.400 --> 24:52.500
Look, bud, am I clear to land?

24:52.500 --> 24:55.200
Traffc up here is thicker than
fleas on a hound dog's--

24:55.100 --> 25:00.400
Wo-Wow.! Dad-blast,you dirty road hog--
road hog-- Crazy--

25:00.300 --> 25:04.500
Look-- One at a time--
You stupid, lunkheaded--

25:04.400 --> 25:08.600
- Uh, what did he say, Mr. Bernard?
- I wouldn't dare repeat it.

25:08.500 --> 25:11.700
Well, then give him
the permission to land.

25:11.600 --> 25:17.000
Uh, Captain, you, uh--
you have our permission to land.

25:16.900 --> 25:21.100
- Well, it's about time, bud.!
- Look! Look! There he is!

25:23.300 --> 25:25.900
Doesn't he fly beautifully?

25:25.900 --> 25:29.300
And you wanted to take the train,
you 'fraidy cat.

25:29.200 --> 25:31.600
'Fraidy cat?

25:31.500 --> 25:34.900
It's just that, uh--
No, I-I like trains.

25:34.900 --> 25:38.000
I mean, they serve,
uh, Roquefort, uh--

25:38.600 --> 25:40.800
Pull up! Pull up!

26:02.900 --> 26:06.600
Are-- Are--
Are you hurt, sir?

26:06.400 --> 26:09.400
Nope.
One of my better landings, bud.

26:09.300 --> 26:12.200
Oh, great.

26:12.000 --> 26:14.800
Come on. We're--
We're gonna take the train.

26:16.000 --> 26:17.700
Play it safe.

26:17.600 --> 26:21.300
Train? Safe?
Listen here, buster.

26:21.100 --> 26:25.700
-I'm as fit as a fiddle.
-And you look simply wonderful, Captain.

26:25.600 --> 26:29.500
Oh, shucks,just call me Orville,
little lady.

26:29.500 --> 26:33.600
All right, all right, uh, it's
most important we get to Devil's Bayou.

26:33.500 --> 26:35.700
Well, now,
will you just keep your shirt on?

26:35.700 --> 26:40.000
Flight 1 3 hits the wild blue yonder
in five minutes.

26:46.700 --> 26:49.000
Eight, nine, ten, eleven...

26:49.900 --> 26:52.000
twelve-- Oh, no.

26:53.400 --> 26:55.800
There are 1 3 steps
on this ramp.

26:55.700 --> 26:59.500
Well, why don't you
jump the last one?

27:03.200 --> 27:05.600
This is your captain speaking.

27:05.600 --> 27:09.500
Welcome aboard, folks.
Fasten your seat belts. No smoking.

27:09.300 --> 27:13.300
Just sit back
and leave the driving to me.

27:15.100 --> 27:18.100
Miss Bianca, be sure
it's fastened good and tight.

27:17.900 --> 27:20.900
I can't.
It'll wrinkle my dress.

27:20.800 --> 27:23.400
Say, bud,
read the checklist to me.

27:23.400 --> 27:25.200
Uh, oh, yeah.

27:25.200 --> 27:26.900
Goggles down.

27:28.100 --> 27:31.600
- Check.
- Wing flaps down.
- Check.

27:31.500 --> 27:35.300
- Tail feathers.
- Double check.

27:35.300 --> 27:37.600
''If at first you don't succeed...

27:38.300 --> 27:40.400
try, try again.''

27:40.400 --> 27:42.900
And here we go!

27:50.000 --> 27:52.200
I sure wish
we'd have taken the train.

28:05.600 --> 28:08.500
Oh, I just love takeoffs!

28:19.800 --> 28:22.800
Captain, you fly beautifully.

28:22.700 --> 28:25.100
It's just like being
on a ''roller scoater.''

28:29.800 --> 28:35.000
- He just went through a red light.
- Oh, I do that all the time, darling.

28:34.800 --> 28:38.500
Now, come on.
Stop worrying.

28:57.700 --> 29:02.000
Come along

29:01.800 --> 29:04.100
Will there be sunshine shinin'

29:04.100 --> 29:06.900
Will we find a silver linin'

29:06.900 --> 29:10.000
Come along

29:10.000 --> 29:14.300
Sing a song

29:14.100 --> 29:19.100
When today becomes tomorrow
Will we findjoy or sorrow

29:18.900 --> 29:22.300
Sing a song

29:22.200 --> 29:26.200
Is it wrong

29:26.200 --> 29:28.800
To put all our hopes together

29:28.700 --> 29:31.400
And wish for somethin'better

29:31.300 --> 29:34.500
Is it wrong

29:34.400 --> 29:37.500
To be loved

29:38.700 --> 29:40.800
To face the future
with another

29:40.800 --> 29:43.200
Who means more than any other

29:43.100 --> 29:46.200
Is to be loved

29:47.400 --> 29:51.300
We'll paint the grey clouds

29:51.300 --> 29:55.400
With pretty rainbow hues

29:55.200 --> 29:59.600
And we'll brush the gloom away

29:59.400 --> 30:05.200
And save it for a rainy day

30:05.000 --> 30:08.700
Rainy day

30:08.500 --> 30:12.600
Oh, today

30:13.700 --> 30:15.700
If troubles cast a shadow

30:15.700 --> 30:21.500
And shadows make the sun
afraid to stay

30:21.200 --> 30:25.500
Why, it's okay

30:25.400 --> 30:27.700
'Cause there'll be
sunshine shinin'

30:27.700 --> 30:30.100
And we'll find the silver linin'

30:30.000 --> 30:33.100
Another day

30:35.100 --> 30:37.200
Uh, listen to this.

30:37.200 --> 30:42.000
It says here Devil's Bayou
is uncharted and hazardous.

30:41.800 --> 30:43.500
Each day's operations...

30:43.500 --> 30:45.200
Hmm, interesting.

30:46.000 --> 30:48.000
must be...

30:48.000 --> 30:50.000
Good night, dear.

30:51.000 --> 30:53.000
planned with...

30:52.900 --> 30:54.800
care and--

30:59.400 --> 31:03.400
Tomorrow is another day

31:03.400 --> 31:05.400
Good night, Bianca.

31:07.800 --> 31:13.800
How I hope you'll always stay

32:04.400 --> 32:06.600
Penny!

32:06.600 --> 32:08.100
Penny?

32:09.100 --> 32:11.200
Penny, answer me!

32:12.100 --> 32:13.700
Penny?

32:22.500 --> 32:25.200
Snoops!
Snoops, get down here!

32:25.200 --> 32:28.600
W-W-What's up, Medusa?
W-What's going on?

32:28.400 --> 32:31.700
That little brat
has escaped again.

32:31.700 --> 32:36.200
Nero, Brutus,
bring her back, boys.

32:55.300 --> 32:57.400
Why won't it start?

32:57.400 --> 33:00.200
Snoops! What's wrong?

33:00.100 --> 33:03.500
W-W-What's wro-- I don't-- I don't know.
It was working good yesterday.

33:03.500 --> 33:05.800
Oh, shut up!

33:05.800 --> 33:11.500
Send up flares!
Light up the swamp so I can find her!

33:26.700 --> 33:29.800
Well, folks, we'll be landing
at Devil's Bayou in just a minute.

33:29.800 --> 33:32.700
Your crew thanks you
for flying Albatross Air--

33:33.800 --> 33:36.200
What in the--

33:41.700 --> 33:45.500
Sufferin' sassafras!
My rudder's on fire!

33:47.200 --> 33:49.800
Bail out! Bail out!

33:50.700 --> 33:53.300
Help!

33:53.300 --> 33:55.800
Bernard!

34:00.600 --> 34:02.300
Mayday! Mayday!

34:12.800 --> 34:17.800
Sufferin' catfish!
What on earth?

34:17.600 --> 34:20.900
Luke! Luke, wake up!

34:23.600 --> 34:26.100
Luke, get down here!

34:32.400 --> 34:34.400
It's Orville!

34:34.300 --> 34:36.100
Oh, that Orville.

34:36.199 --> 34:40.400
No, Luke, no. He's in trouble!
You get down here right now!

34:40.300 --> 34:42.300
I'm a-comin'.

34:51.400 --> 34:54.000
Wow-wee!

34:53.900 --> 34:57.800
This new batch
really packs a wallop!

35:00.200 --> 35:02.100
Look out below!

35:10.600 --> 35:15.000
Oh, what a shame.
Here, honey, let me help you.

35:18.600 --> 35:23.600
Say, cousin, you look like
you could use a swig of this.

35:23.500 --> 35:25.800
It's good for what ails ya.

35:29.300 --> 35:31.000
There.

35:31.000 --> 35:33.300
Where are you folks from, anyway?

35:34.800 --> 35:36.800
We're--

35:38.100 --> 35:40.500
We're from New Y-- New York.

35:40.500 --> 35:44.700
Now, stand back, folks. I ain't gonna
hang around this creepy place long.

35:44.600 --> 35:47.200
Clear the runway!

36:01.100 --> 36:03.700
Great balls of fire!

36:20.600 --> 36:23.000
Holy smoke!

36:23.000 --> 36:25.400
Why don't you
watch where you're goin'!

37:11.400 --> 37:14.300
Bernard,
it's that terrible Medusa.

37:15.900 --> 37:19.900
I'd like to give her a few whacks
with my rollin' pin.

37:19.700 --> 37:24.300
We swamp folks would like to run her
clean out of our bayou.

37:24.200 --> 37:27.600
Hold it. Hold it!
Somebody's comin' this way.

37:37.200 --> 37:40.400
Why did you have to
go and spoil everything?

37:40.300 --> 37:44.100
Nero, don't you dare
get my teddy bear wet.

37:46.000 --> 37:49.600
Oh, it's that poor
little young 'un.

37:49.500 --> 37:51.700
She's tryin' to run away again.

37:51.700 --> 37:55.600
It's Penny.
Oh, how terrible.

37:59.600 --> 38:03.000
Hurry! We've got to find out
where they're taking her!

38:08.300 --> 38:12.600
You'll need a boat. Evinrude's
got the fastest boat around here.

38:12.500 --> 38:16.400
Evinrude, wake up!
Start up your engine, boy!

38:19.800 --> 38:23.800
Send Evinrude back
as soon as you need help.

38:23.600 --> 38:25.900
I'll round up the neighbors!

38:32.600 --> 38:35.800
Faster!
Evinrude, faster!

38:44.000 --> 38:46.000
You stop that, Brutus.

38:52.400 --> 38:55.700
This fog is awful.
You can't see a thing.

39:00.900 --> 39:03.400
Sl-Slow down, Evinrude.

39:08.600 --> 39:10.600
They gotta be
around here somewhere.

39:14.500 --> 39:17.500
Oh, dear! We've lost them!

39:19.300 --> 39:21.100
Jehoshaphat!

39:22.800 --> 39:25.800
Hang on!
Hard to port, Evinrude!

39:28.000 --> 39:30.000
Help me, Bernard!

39:36.200 --> 39:40.100
Help! Bernard!

39:40.000 --> 39:41.500
Bianca!

40:13.100 --> 40:16.300
C-Come on, Evinrude.
Give it all you've got.

40:16.100 --> 40:17.800
Keep trying, Evinrude.

40:22.200 --> 40:24.700
Poor Evinrude.

40:24.700 --> 40:28.400
Your carburettor
is all pooped out.

40:28.300 --> 40:30.400
Bring her right on in, boys.

40:31.600 --> 40:33.400
Come on.

40:33.400 --> 40:37.000
So, you tried to run away.
Well, it didn't work, did it? Huh?

40:38.700 --> 40:40.500
Put me down, Brutus!

40:43.000 --> 40:45.500
Cranky old dragon.

40:45.400 --> 40:47.000
Nice work. Good boys.

40:48.700 --> 40:53.900
W-W-Wait, boys. Steady, boy.
D-D-Down, boys. Heel. Heel!

40:53.800 --> 40:56.400
There, there, Teddy.

40:56.400 --> 41:01.400
I won't let them do that
to you again. Don't cry.

41:01.200 --> 41:03.800
Oh, Teddy, Teddy, Teddy, Teddy.
Poor Teddy.

41:03.800 --> 41:07.100
All she ever thinks about
is that simple bear.

41:07.100 --> 41:11.000
Now, you behave, or I'll let Nero
and Brutus have your old teddy bear.

41:10.900 --> 41:14.200
You will not!
Besides, I'm not scared of'em...

41:14.100 --> 41:16.600
like you are, Mr. Snoops.

41:16.500 --> 41:18.700
Oh, don't you sass me.

41:18.600 --> 41:22.000
Ah, uh, boys, take this naughty
little girl to her room.

41:23.200 --> 41:26.800
I can go by myself, thank you.

41:40.800 --> 41:44.900
Stick around, Evinrude.
We'll-- We'll signal if we need you.

41:44.800 --> 41:47.700
Look out! Here she comes!

41:59.500 --> 42:02.800
Where is she? Where is she?

42:02.600 --> 42:05.900
Ah, eh, w-where is she?
Oh, I-I sent her up to her room.

42:05.900 --> 42:10.800
Why did you let her escape?
What is your alibi this time, nitwit?

42:10.700 --> 42:13.500
Nitwit?
Well, don't blame me, Medusa.

42:13.500 --> 42:17.300
Those leather-headed lizards
of yours, they're supposed
to be patrolling the island.

42:17.200 --> 42:19.300
They let her get away.

42:20.900 --> 42:26.100
Ha! My precious pets.

42:26.000 --> 42:31.000
We know who caught that
ungrateful little brat, don't we, hmm?

42:30.900 --> 42:34.200
It was your brilliant idea to use
the little girl for this caper.

42:34.000 --> 42:37.600
- If you'd left it to me--
- Snoops, you're not thinking.

42:37.500 --> 42:42.500
I know, I know. She's the only one small
enough to squeeze down the black hole.

42:42.400 --> 42:47.300
Yes, but why can't she
find my big diamond?

42:47.200 --> 42:51.100
I don't know, but--
but just look at these beauties
that she brought up from the cave.

42:50.900 --> 42:53.500
Oh, they'll sell
for a lot of cold cash.

42:53.500 --> 42:55.500
Ow!

42:55.500 --> 42:57.700
I wish you wouldn't do that.

42:57.700 --> 43:01.200
She's insane. Utterly mad.

43:01.100 --> 43:03.500
I want that diamond.

43:03.400 --> 43:08.400
I've got to have
the Devil's Eye!

43:08.200 --> 43:11.100
You didn't leave the girl
down in the cave long enough.

43:11.100 --> 43:13.800
She won't take orders.

43:13.800 --> 43:18.200
You are too soft.

43:18.100 --> 43:21.100
But the water was rising
and the tide was coming in...

43:21.100 --> 43:25.200
and all she did down there was fuss
about her teddy bear getting wet.

43:25.100 --> 43:30.700
Snoops, you don't have a way
with children.

43:30.500 --> 43:33.900
You must gain their confidence...

43:33.900 --> 43:37.100
make them like you.

43:37.100 --> 43:39.300
Yeah? How do you do that?

43:39.300 --> 43:42.200
You force them
to like you, idiot!

43:42.000 --> 43:44.000
At the next low tide...

43:44.100 --> 43:48.300
I am going to
put her down there myself...

43:48.200 --> 43:50.400
and keep her there...

43:50.400 --> 43:52.600
until she finds it.

43:52.500 --> 43:56.300
And it is as simple as that.

43:56.200 --> 43:58.800
Oh, it's as simple as that, is it?

43:58.800 --> 44:01.800
Well, you're the boss, uh, boss.

44:02.500 --> 44:04.600
Yes.

44:04.600 --> 44:07.500
Now come along, petsy-poos.

44:09.000 --> 44:11.300
We gotta get Penny
out of here tonight.

44:26.100 --> 44:31.000
-Uh-oh. Bianca, they smell your perfume.
-Oh, dear.

45:02.400 --> 45:05.200
- Oh, no!
- Mis Bianca!

45:07.100 --> 45:09.300
Let go, you-you-you,
you big bullies, you!

46:41.900 --> 46:46.900
Brutus! Nero!
Stop that infernal racket!

46:46.800 --> 46:48.600
I mean now!

46:51.200 --> 46:55.400
Snoops! Snoops, a mouse!
Oh, kill it, kill it!

46:58.300 --> 47:01.000
Oh, Snoops, kill it!

47:04.000 --> 47:06.500
Look! There's another one!

47:29.400 --> 47:32.500
Oh, what is wrong with this thing?

47:37.300 --> 47:39.900
Snoops! What's wrong?

47:39.900 --> 47:41.500
I don't--

47:51.900 --> 47:53.900
E-E-Evinrude, over here!

48:06.800 --> 48:08.900
Are you--
Are you all right, dear?

48:08.900 --> 48:11.600
Why, she-- she tried to kill us.

48:11.600 --> 48:13.900
That-- That-- That terrible woman!

48:13.900 --> 48:18.300
Oh, if I was only a ten-foot mouse,
I'd show her.

48:18.200 --> 48:21.200
It's-- It's no use, Bianca.

48:22.300 --> 48:24.300
Maybe Rufus the cat was right.

48:25.500 --> 48:28.100
Wh-What can two little mice do?

48:29.100 --> 48:32.500
R-E-S-C-U-E

48:32.400 --> 48:36.000
Rescue Aid Society

48:35.900 --> 48:39.300
But, Bernard,
the Society's counting on us.

48:39.200 --> 48:41.700
We can't quit now.

48:41.600 --> 48:43.900
Oh, and that little girl.

48:43.900 --> 48:46.300
We've just got to rescue her.

48:46.200 --> 48:49.700
Rescue Aid Society

48:49.600 --> 48:51.700
Heads held high

48:54.900 --> 48:57.200
Penny dear!

48:57.200 --> 49:01.600
Auntie Medusa
wants to talk to you!

49:01.500 --> 49:03.600
High tide or not...

49:03.500 --> 49:08.000
that little brat is going
to find me that diamond...

49:07.900 --> 49:09.500
tomorrow...

49:09.600 --> 49:11.400
or else!

49:12.800 --> 49:15.600
Come in. Come in.

49:15.500 --> 49:18.500
Did you want to see me, ma'am?

49:18.400 --> 49:23.000
Why, yes, my dear.
Don't be so shy.

49:22.900 --> 49:26.800
Now, I am going to let
bygones be bygones.

49:26.700 --> 49:30.900
Do you know what would make
Auntie Medusa very happy?

49:32.000 --> 49:34.600
Yes, you want me
to find that diamond.

49:34.600 --> 49:37.500
That's right, dear!

49:37.400 --> 49:41.200
But I've tried
hard as I could, honest.

49:41.100 --> 49:43.200
Of course you have.

49:43.200 --> 49:47.000
But we must try harder,
mustn't we?

49:46.800 --> 49:52.300
Then please will you take me back
to the orphanage like you promised?

49:52.200 --> 49:54.500
Penny, don't you like it here?

49:54.500 --> 49:58.000
A big, beautiful boat
all to yourself.

49:57.900 --> 50:01.400
But if I don't get back
to the orphanage...

50:01.400 --> 50:03.800
I'll never get 'dopted.

50:03.800 --> 50:05.700
Adopted?

50:05.700 --> 50:08.300
What makes you think
anyone would want...

50:08.300 --> 50:10.800
a homely little girl like you?

50:36.100 --> 50:39.800
Be brave, little one

50:39.800 --> 50:41.600
Make a wish

50:41.500 --> 50:45.100
For each sad little tear

50:45.000 --> 50:47.300
Hold your head up

50:47.200 --> 50:50.300
Though no one is near

50:50.300 --> 50:56.700
Someone's waiting for you

50:57.900 --> 51:01.300
Don't cry, little one

51:01.100 --> 51:03.400
There'll be a smile

51:03.300 --> 51:07.300
Where a frown used to be

51:07.300 --> 51:13.100
You'll be part of the love
that you see

51:12.800 --> 51:18.700
Someone's waiting for you

51:19.800 --> 51:22.700
Always keep a little prayer

51:22.700 --> 51:25.500
In your pocket

51:25.500 --> 51:31.900
And you're sure
to see the light

51:31.700 --> 51:37.200
Soon there'll bejoy
and happiness

51:37.000 --> 51:40.200
And your little world

51:40.200 --> 51:43.900
Will be bright

51:45.100 --> 51:48.900
Have faith, little one

51:48.700 --> 51:54.800
Till your hopes and your wishes
come true

51:54.600 --> 51:58.100
You must try to be brave

51:58.000 --> 52:01.100
Little one

52:01.100 --> 52:06.800
Someone's waiting

52:06.600 --> 52:11.100
To love

52:10.900 --> 52:16.300
You

52:24.400 --> 52:26.600
Good night, Teddy.

52:26.600 --> 52:29.000
Sleep tight.

52:29.000 --> 52:31.900
Oh, we almost forgot
to say our prayers.

52:34.600 --> 52:38.300
Please bless Rufus and Teddy...

52:38.200 --> 52:41.000
and all the kids at the orphanage--

52:40.900 --> 52:45.800
Jennifer, Bobby, Mary,Julie.

52:45.600 --> 52:49.600
And please let someone find my bottle.
There's a message in it.

52:49.400 --> 52:53.400
Because running away
isn't working. Amen.

52:54.500 --> 52:57.400
Don't worry, Teddy. We'll--

52:57.300 --> 53:00.800
We'll be all right.

53:09.700 --> 53:12.300
Penny. Penny.

53:14.800 --> 53:16.600
Yes?

53:16.600 --> 53:21.200
Penny-- Penny, dear, now don't cry.
We are here to help you.

53:22.200 --> 53:26.000
We-- Hi!
Where'd you come from?

53:25.800 --> 53:29.100
We found the bottle with-- with your
message, and we've come to rescue you.

53:29.100 --> 53:32.700
Did you hear that, Teddy?
Our bottle worked!

53:34.400 --> 53:37.000
Didn't you bring
somebody big with you...

53:36.900 --> 53:38.900
like the police?

53:39.000 --> 53:41.900
Uh, no, there's--
there's just the-- the two of us.

53:41.700 --> 53:46.300
But if the three of us work together,
and we have a little faith--

53:46.100 --> 53:48.100
That's what Rufus said.

53:48.100 --> 53:51.000
Faith makes things turn out right.

53:51.000 --> 53:55.000
Penny, I know it's late, but we
have to escape tonight, right now.

53:54.900 --> 53:58.500
But I just got caught
by Brutus and Nero.

53:58.400 --> 54:00.700
Look what they did to my pants.

54:00.700 --> 54:03.900
Yeah, and they're-- they're still
down there guarding the gangplank.

54:03.900 --> 54:09.500
Oh, those vicious monsters.
They ought to be locked up in a cage.

54:09.300 --> 54:12.700
I know, I know.
Come on. I'll show you.

54:13.600 --> 54:15.900
See there? The elevator.

54:15.900 --> 54:18.400
Oh, it's a perfect cage, Penny.

54:21.800 --> 54:24.900
Great idea.

54:24.800 --> 54:27.300
Now, uh, wha-wha--
what can we use for bait?

54:27.200 --> 54:29.200
Oh, they'll eat anything.

54:30.300 --> 54:32.400
- Yeah, I know.
- I've got it.

54:32.400 --> 54:36.600
My perfume. Remember? They'll follow
the scent right into the elevator.

54:36.500 --> 54:39.200
And I'll slam the door.

54:39.200 --> 54:41.900
And would that make Medusa mad.

54:41.900 --> 54:44.200
Brutus! Nero!

54:44.200 --> 54:47.200
Did you let that little brat
escape again?

54:47.100 --> 54:49.200
You're too soft.

54:52.600 --> 54:55.000
Hey, Penny, that's not bad.

54:54.900 --> 54:57.400
That's exactly like Medusa.

54:58.600 --> 55:02.000
Track her down, boys.
Bring her back.

55:02.000 --> 55:06.100
And we'll be so far ahead,
they'll never catch us.

55:05.900 --> 55:09.800
Wait a minute. She-- She might
catch us in-- in her swamp-mobile.

55:09.700 --> 55:13.100
We'll swipe it.
I've always wanted to drive it.

55:15.300 --> 55:18.100
Wh-What if Medusa wakes up
wh-wh-while we're starting it?

55:18.100 --> 55:20.400
W-We're in trouble.

55:20.300 --> 55:22.500
We-We've gotta stall 'em somehow.

55:22.400 --> 55:25.400
How 'bout Mr. Snoop's fireworks?

55:25.300 --> 55:29.400
We'll shoot 'em off in her bedroom.
That will keep her busy.

55:29.300 --> 55:32.100
Oh, Bernard, it's so exciting.

55:32.100 --> 55:35.400
Perfume, crocs, swamp-mobiles.

55:35.300 --> 55:37.500
It's just got to work.

55:37.500 --> 55:41.700
It's our only chance.
But-- But we're gonna need help.

55:41.600 --> 55:44.500
Snoops! Snoops, get down here!

55:46.000 --> 55:49.100
Uh, w-what's up, Medusa?
W-What's going on?

55:51.100 --> 55:54.500
Oh, shut up!
High tide or not--

55:54.500 --> 55:57.900
I bet those two are up to something.

55:57.800 --> 56:01.700
Gee, I don't wanna go down
that awful black hole again.

56:01.600 --> 56:03.700
Don't worry about that, dear.

56:03.800 --> 56:05.700
You must hurry and get dressed.

56:05.600 --> 56:07.400
Come on.
We haven't got much time.

56:08.400 --> 56:11.000
E-Evinrude? Uh, up here.

56:13.000 --> 56:16.000
W-We need help.
G-Go get Ellie Mae.

56:16.000 --> 56:17.800
An-And hurry!

57:08.800 --> 57:11.600
Ya-hoo!

57:11.600 --> 57:14.300
Are you ready to help rescue
that little young 'un?

57:14.100 --> 57:17.300
- Sure enough, Ellie Mae.
- Hallelujah!

57:18.500 --> 57:22.300
Luke! On your feet,
you lazy critter!

57:23.300 --> 57:28.400
Shucks, Ellie Mae. I was just a-waitin'
for someone to holler ''charge''!

57:28.300 --> 57:32.300
Dagnab it. Let's cut out the jawin'
and get a-goin'!

57:33.200 --> 57:37.700
When old Gramps gets ''het'' up,
his nose gets plumb out of joint.

57:37.600 --> 57:39.200
Take it easy, Gramps.

57:39.100 --> 57:42.400
We gotta stay here till Evinrude
brings us word from them mice.

57:42.400 --> 57:44.900
If'n that bug don't get here soon...

57:44.900 --> 57:48.600
they'll put that poor little girl
down the black hole again.

57:53.600 --> 57:57.600
All right, you little brat. Now, you
are gonna go down in that hole...

57:57.500 --> 58:00.200
and you are gonna dig
till you find me the diamond.

58:00.200 --> 58:02.800
You understand that?
And no sassing me.

58:02.800 --> 58:06.800
Uh-uh-uh. Snoops,
that is no way to speak...

58:06.600 --> 58:10.100
to our little Miss Penny.

58:10.000 --> 58:12.600
What? Oh.
Okay, boss, okay.

58:12.600 --> 58:15.000
Now, my dear...

58:15.000 --> 58:18.300
you are going to find
the big, shiny diamond...

58:18.100 --> 58:20.700
for your Auntie Medusa.

58:20.600 --> 58:22.800
Aren't you?

58:22.800 --> 58:24.900
Teddy doesn't like it down there.

58:24.900 --> 58:27.900
He's afraid.
Aren't you, Teddy?

58:27.800 --> 58:31.300
Ah. Poor Teddy.

58:31.200 --> 58:35.200
I'll just keep him up here with me,
where he'll be safe.

58:35.200 --> 58:37.200
Give me back my teddy bear!

58:37.200 --> 58:39.600
He's mine! He's mine!

58:43.900 --> 58:48.100
You get down there
and find the big diamond...

58:48.000 --> 58:51.400
or you will never see
that Teddy again!

58:52.300 --> 58:55.200
All right, all right.

58:55.200 --> 58:56.900
I'll go.

58:56.900 --> 58:59.000
Boss, you've really
got a way with kids.

59:02.300 --> 59:05.000
Don't worry, Teddy.
I won't be gone long.

59:04.900 --> 59:07.100
I'll find her old diamond.

59:20.100 --> 59:24.800
Oh, what a dreadful,
frightening place.

59:24.700 --> 59:27.300
Yeah, it used to be
a pirates' cave.

59:27.300 --> 59:29.900
How do you know that, Penny?

59:29.800 --> 59:33.800
- Him.
- Ah! Oh, dear!

59:33.800 --> 59:37.000
Come on, girls. Let's-- Let's look for
that diamond so we can get out of here.

59:36.900 --> 59:38.600
Oh, I looked there already.

59:38.700 --> 59:41.200
Medusa doesn't want
those little ones.

59:44.500 --> 59:47.800
What-- What's--
What's-- What's-- What's that?

59:51.100 --> 59:54.000
That's where the water comes in.

59:53.900 --> 59:56.600
I'm afraid to go over there.

59:56.500 --> 59:59.400
Well, if I was a pirate...

59:59.200 --> 01:00:01.700
that's just where I'd hide
the Devil's Eye.

01:00:01.700 --> 01:00:06.400
I'll, uh-- I'll--
I'll go over and check it out.

01:00:17.900 --> 01:00:21.100
Uh, come--
c-come to think of it...

01:00:21.100 --> 01:00:25.300
if I was a pirate, I wouldn't--
I wouldn't hide anything back there.

01:00:25.100 --> 01:00:26.900
Bernard, look!

01:00:26.800 --> 01:00:30.100
I can see something.
Come on.

01:00:30.100 --> 01:00:33.000
- Come on. Let's see what it is.
- No, no, Bianca.

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:34.700
You-- You stay here.

01:00:34.700 --> 01:00:39.100
I'll see if I can find
a safe way over.

01:00:49.600 --> 01:00:53.100
- Bianca!
- Oh! Hang on!

01:00:53.100 --> 01:00:55.600
- Help!
- I'm coming!

01:00:58.400 --> 01:01:02.700
- What are you doing down there?
- I'm looking.

01:01:02.600 --> 01:01:05.200
Well, look faster.

01:01:31.600 --> 01:01:33.600
Wow!

01:01:37.900 --> 01:01:39.900
P-Penny, hold--
hold your lantern up again.

01:01:43.300 --> 01:01:47.700
- Holy mackerel. That-- That's it.
- The Devil's Eye.

01:01:47.600 --> 01:01:51.900
Penny, we found it!
We found it!

01:01:51.700 --> 01:01:54.800
Medusa, I found it!

01:01:54.700 --> 01:01:56.900
Let me look.
Let me look, Medusa!

01:01:56.900 --> 01:01:59.300
Back! Ah, good girl.

01:01:59.300 --> 01:02:01.800
Good girl, good girl!
Let's get it up here.

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:31.700
Look, it won't go through.

01:02:33.700 --> 01:02:35.300
I can't get it out.

01:02:35.300 --> 01:02:39.100
- What's taking so long?
- It's stuck tight.

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:41.100
Stuck tight?

01:02:41.100 --> 01:02:45.600
You get that diamond,
or you'll never see daylight again!

01:02:47.700 --> 01:02:50.100
No, no, back! Back, Penny!

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:53.000
Oh, Penny, you'll fall!

01:03:09.900 --> 01:03:14.600
For-- Forget the-- the diamond.
Let's get out of here before we drown.

01:03:20.300 --> 01:03:23.900
The water's coming in.
Please pull me up.

01:03:23.700 --> 01:03:27.400
Not until you get the diamond.

01:03:27.300 --> 01:03:30.000
Penny, the-- the pirate sword.
Use-- Use the sword.

01:04:00.500 --> 01:04:03.100
Penny! Penny, help!

01:04:16.300 --> 01:04:21.600
I've got it! I've got it!
Hurry! P-Pull me up!

01:04:22.200 --> 01:04:24.600
Faster, Snoops. Faster.

01:04:24.600 --> 01:04:27.900
Pulling as fast as I can.

01:04:27.900 --> 01:04:30.500
At last!

01:04:30.400 --> 01:04:33.000
The Devil's Eye!

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:39.500
It's worth millions!

01:04:40.400 --> 01:04:42.900
Just look at it.

01:04:42.900 --> 01:04:45.400
Filled with power...

01:04:45.400 --> 01:04:47.400
for its owner.

01:04:47.300 --> 01:04:49.600
Let me-- Let me look at it.

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:54.300
I can't--
Hey, that wasn't a very good look.

01:04:54.100 --> 01:04:57.300
But I know that there's enough there
to cut it into two equal shares.

01:04:57.300 --> 01:05:01.900
You idiot!
Cut up a perfect gem?

01:05:01.800 --> 01:05:06.400
And it's mine. It's all mine.

01:05:06.300 --> 01:05:09.900
All yours? Half of it is mine,
you double-crossing crook!

01:05:09.800 --> 01:05:14.500
- Put me down, Brutus!
- It's mine! It's all mine!

01:05:14.300 --> 01:05:17.600
- Double-crosser!
- Cheap pickpocket.

01:05:17.500 --> 01:05:20.800
- Chiseler!
- Cheap crook!

01:05:57.100 --> 01:05:58.700
Land's sakes!

01:05:58.800 --> 01:06:00.500
It's Evinrude!

01:06:00.500 --> 01:06:03.100
Oh, well, sure is a mess.

01:06:03.100 --> 01:06:05.300
Where in tarnation you been, boy?

01:06:05.300 --> 01:06:07.100
- What's happening?
- Do they want us now?

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:09.000
- Well, where are they?
- They're on the boat?

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:13.800
- Speak up, boy.
- Buck up! We mustn't be
quitting now, must we?

01:06:17.300 --> 01:06:20.900
Stand back!
Give poor Evinrude some air!

01:06:20.800 --> 01:06:22.900
He's plumb tuckered out.

01:06:22.900 --> 01:06:26.600
Here, son, this'll make
a new bug out of you.

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:37.500
Charge! Ya-hoo!

01:06:41.700 --> 01:06:44.400
We're gonna have us
a rip-snortin' fight.

01:06:47.300 --> 01:06:51.200
Yee-hoo! Charge!

01:06:53.800 --> 01:06:56.000
Where'd everybody go?

01:07:22.500 --> 01:07:25.100
I don't need any help
from anybody!

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:28.600
Charge! Ya-hoo!

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:40.300
Welsher! Swindler! Chiseler!

01:07:40.300 --> 01:07:43.500
Shut up, Snoops, and don't move.

01:07:43.400 --> 01:07:47.600
If either of you
try to follow me...

01:07:47.500 --> 01:07:50.000
you'll get blasted!

01:07:49.900 --> 01:07:53.000
You give me my teddy bear.
You promised.

01:07:54.100 --> 01:07:56.300
Teddy goes with me, my dear.

01:07:56.200 --> 01:07:59.600
I've become quite attached...

01:07:59.500 --> 01:08:01.000
to him.

01:08:07.600 --> 01:08:09.900
My diamond!
My diamond!

01:08:18.700 --> 01:08:20.600
Charge!

01:08:39.600 --> 01:08:41.300
Now!

01:08:42.200 --> 01:08:44.899
Now! Now!

01:08:50.800 --> 01:08:53.000
Look out!

01:09:02.399 --> 01:09:04.399
Oh, please start.

01:09:05.700 --> 01:09:08.700
Advance the spark.

01:09:08.700 --> 01:09:11.000
Not the horn, the spark lever.

01:09:10.899 --> 01:09:13.399
Digger, hold this.

01:09:13.300 --> 01:09:15.399
It's that doohickey
on the steering wheel.

01:09:25.300 --> 01:09:27.200
You-- You...

01:09:27.200 --> 01:09:29.600
and your infernal fireworks!

01:09:29.500 --> 01:09:31.800
You-- You--

01:09:31.800 --> 01:09:33.500
Oh, you dunderhead!

01:09:35.899 --> 01:09:37.800
We're not getting any gas.

01:09:37.800 --> 01:09:41.300
Fill her up, Luke.
Hurry. All of it!

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:24.900
Look out! The riverboat!

01:10:42.900 --> 01:10:45.900
- We did it, Bianca!
- Hooray! Oh, Bernard!

01:10:45.900 --> 01:10:48.200
Bernard, you're wonderful!

01:10:48.200 --> 01:10:49.900
- We did it!
- We got her!

01:10:49.900 --> 01:10:52.600
We sure showed that Medusa!

01:10:53.500 --> 01:10:55.600
There goes...

01:10:55.500 --> 01:10:58.600
my diamond!

01:11:04.400 --> 01:11:07.100
And because of a courageous
little girl named Penny...

01:11:07.100 --> 01:11:10.000
the world's largest diamond,
the Devil's Eye...

01:11:09.900 --> 01:11:12.700
is now in the Smithsonian Institute.

01:11:12.700 --> 01:11:15.400
But what's even
more important, folks...

01:11:15.400 --> 01:11:18.300
this little orphan's dream
has come true.

01:11:18.200 --> 01:11:20.700
Today she's being adopted.

01:11:20.600 --> 01:11:23.600
-And here she is
with her new mother and father.
- For she's a jolly good fellow

01:11:23.600 --> 01:11:26.800
For Penny's a jolly good fellow
For Penny's a jolly good fellow

01:11:26.800 --> 01:11:28.800
From Morningside Orphanage

01:11:28.700 --> 01:11:32.300
She's got a new mom and dad
Hooray for her mom and dad

01:11:32.200 --> 01:11:37.100
- For Penny's a jolly good fellow
For Penny's a jolly good fellow
- Bernard, I am so happy for Penny.

01:11:36.900 --> 01:11:39.100
- For Penny's a jolly good fellow
- Yeah, so y-you might say that...

01:11:39.100 --> 01:11:41.400
- that Penny, uh, brought us together.
- From Morningside Orphanage

01:11:41.400 --> 01:11:43.700
You are a darling.

01:11:43.700 --> 01:11:46.900
Penny,you were a brave little girl
to do what you did all by yourself.

01:11:46.900 --> 01:11:49.700
Oh, I didn't do it
all by myself.

01:11:49.600 --> 01:11:54.000
Two little mice from
the Rescue Aid Society helped me.

01:11:53.900 --> 01:11:57.200
Mice? Rescue Aid Society?

01:11:57.100 --> 01:11:59.500
Yes, they rescued me.

01:11:59.500 --> 01:12:02.900
Uh, could I say hello to them?
Hello, Bianca.!

01:12:02.900 --> 01:12:04.500
Hi, Bernard.!

01:12:04.400 --> 01:12:06.700
You can talk to these little mice?

01:12:06.600 --> 01:12:09.300
All the time.
Mice can talk like anybody.

01:12:09.200 --> 01:12:11.200
Didn't you know that?

01:12:11.100 --> 01:12:14.700
Well, uh, I didn't,
but I do now, Penny.

01:12:22.300 --> 01:12:26.100
Evinrude, what are you doing here?

01:12:31.400 --> 01:12:33.700
It's another call for help.

01:12:33.600 --> 01:12:35.700
Here, uh, uh...

01:12:35.700 --> 01:12:38.200
you're gonna need some volunteers.

01:12:38.100 --> 01:12:40.700
But-- B-But, B-Bianca,
we just--

01:12:40.700 --> 01:12:44.000
Oh, Bernard, adventure, thrills...

01:12:43.900 --> 01:12:46.900
intrigue, travel, exotic places.

01:12:46.900 --> 01:12:49.200
Oh, come on, darling. Let's go.

01:13:01.400 --> 01:13:04.100
I sure wish we'd have taken the train.

01:13:30.300 --> 01:13:35.200
Tomorrow is another day

01:13:38.300 --> 01:13:43.600
How I hope you'll always stay

01:13:46.200 --> 01:13:50.900
Tomorrow is another day
