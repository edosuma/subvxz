to that?

04:38.033 --> 04:39.533
- I think she changed
the boundaries,

04:39.567 --> 04:43.200
so I think if you sign up
to do a reality show,

04:43.233 --> 04:45.300
you have to be prepared
to open up your life.

04:45.333 --> 04:49.066
What Brandi did wasn't
to expose what many of us knew.

04:49.100 --> 04:51.767
It was to expose the fact
that she consistently lied.

04:52.000 --> 04:53.600
That was the point.

04:53.633 --> 04:56.266

not coming today?

04:56.300 --> 04:57.700
- I think it's a mistake
as well

stories to the press

05:00.433 --> 05:02.600

and I don't believe that.

05:02.633 --> 05:04.600

she should have come,

as a housewife

05:19.500 --> 05:23.367

she wasn't showing up

05:23.400 --> 05:25.266
and then not coming.

05:25.300 --> 05:27.567
I sure wish she was here.

05:27.600 --> 05:31.533
- Well, I think she gave
that interview yesterday

05:31.567 --> 05:33.467
so that she could say she quit

05:33.500 --> 05:35.400
because she knew
that if she didn't

05:35.433 --> 05:38.000
show up here today
that you would probably

05:38.033 --> 05:40.033
do the same thing that you
had to do with Adrienne

05:40.066 --> 05:44.300
and fire her, so she was
preempting getting "fired"

05:44.333 --> 05:46.266
by saying she quit yesterday.

to show up when Kim and I--

come from that night?

"I have no inclination
to reunite with the women

06:14.500 --> 06:18.467

06:20.000 --> 06:22.100

of harassing her?

06:22.133 --> 06:23.667

06:23.700 --> 06:26.567
that you have no contact with
whatsoever?

06:26.600 --> 06:28.133
- None of these women, I think,

06:28.166 --> 06:30.300
have even seen her
since Denise's wedding.

06:30.333 --> 06:33.700
- She literally pinched
my butt, and we were giggling.

06:35.100 --> 06:37.667

came out yesterday,

06:43.333 --> 06:48.400
there was another piece in,
of all places, "Radar Online."

06:48.433 --> 06:51.400
- No, you're kidding.
- Really?

nailed to the cross,

06:57.166 --> 07:02.567
and stoned by her co-stars
all at the same time."

07:02.600 --> 07:04.667
Erika, how do--how do you
respond to this source?

07:04.700 --> 07:07.467

We need the wood.

07:07.500 --> 07:09.133

07:09.166 --> 07:12.033

also said, quote,

07:12.066 --> 07:15.333
"Lisa always wins."

07:15.367 --> 07:18.133
Kyle, is she winning
by not being here today?

07:18.166 --> 07:19.567
- No. I think that it was

07:19.600 --> 07:21.467
really a big mistake
not to be here.

07:21.500 --> 07:24.033
If she had been here today,
we would have all loved

07:24.066 --> 07:25.433
to have been able
to work through it

07:25.467 --> 07:27.700
even if it meant
agreeing to disagree.

07:27.734 --> 07:29.367
Right, ladies?
Don't you think?

07:29.400 --> 07:31.033
- Of course.
- None of us have said anything.

07:31.066 --> 07:32.567
- I don't think she
is capable

07:32.600 --> 07:35.400
of agreeing to disagree.
I think that's the issue.

07:35.433 --> 07:36.767
- Well, she drew a line
in the sand

07:37.000 --> 07:38.700
and said she wasn't.
- Right.

07:38.734 --> 07:40.667
- About this--this issue.

07:40.700 --> 07:42.734
Teddi, you were quoted
as saying

07:42.767 --> 07:47.066
that your gut was telling you
that Lisa would come today.

07:47.100 --> 07:49.600
- I still feel like there's
a chance she will show up.

07:49.633 --> 07:51.600
- Really?
- I can't imagine

07:51.633 --> 07:55.033
that she won't show up for some
sort of dramatics or something.

07:55.066 --> 07:56.567
- You feel the same way?

07:56.600 --> 07:58.066
You think she's gonna walk
through the door?

07:58.100 --> 08:00.700
- I keep looking
at the back door there.

08:00.734 --> 08:02.700
- She should show up.

08:02.734 --> 08:05.500
- Kyle, I know that you are
holding out a little hope

08:05.533 --> 08:08.100
because you brought
something with you.

08:08.133 --> 08:09.767
- I've had this birthday
present,

08:10.000 --> 08:11.700
you know, since September,
so I thought,

08:11.734 --> 08:14.066
"Well, I might as well
bring it today," but obviously

08:14.100 --> 08:17.500
if she doesn't come today,
I'm just--have it delivered.

08:17.533 --> 08:20.066
- If she doesn't come today,
I'm opening it.

08:20.100 --> 08:21.500
- Oh, my God.
- What is it--you brought it?

08:21.533 --> 08:22.667
- Yeah.
I'm not gonna open it.

08:22.700 --> 08:24.633
- Why do you think
she didn't show up?

08:24.667 --> 08:26.600
- Today?
- Mm-hmm.

08:26.633 --> 08:30.066
- I think that she doesn't want
to face any of us

08:30.100 --> 08:32.433
because she has been unmasked.

08:32.467 --> 08:35.433
The fact that she was
called out

08:35.467 --> 08:37.767
with what originally happened
at Vanderpump Dogs--

08:38.000 --> 08:40.734
Why does--why would you do that
to someone that you care about?

08:40.767 --> 08:42.433
That was the biggest issue.

08:42.467 --> 08:43.667
- Because you don't
care about them.

08:43.700 --> 08:45.600
- So I think
that she can't face that,

08:45.633 --> 08:46.767
so she's focusing
on the "Radar"

08:47.000 --> 08:48.533
over and over and over again

08:48.567 --> 08:50.767
so we can not talk about
what actually happened

08:51.000 --> 08:52.500
at Vanderpump Dogs.

08:55.200 --> 08:57.567
- Coming up...
- Denise is a saint.

08:57.600 --> 09:00.200
It was a really difficult time.
It was in the press.

09:00.233 --> 09:04.433

got into a heated
Twitter battle

10:00.100 --> 10:03.200
with Nicollette Sheridan
about Michael Bolton.

10:03.233 --> 10:07.033
What was that about?
I was very intrigued by this.

10:07.066 --> 10:12.633

went off with Michael Bolton

10:22.166 --> 10:23.233
"I gotta go home."

10:23.266 --> 10:24.700
Got back to the house,

She will deny it,

10:41.333 --> 10:45.200

we would not have our life!

- You don't know
any Spanish?

12:21.333 --> 12:24.300
- I mean, I know hola.
- I even know that.

12:24.333 --> 12:28.100
- I have two teenage
daughters, Sami and Lola,

12:28.133 --> 12:30.400
and their father
is Charlie Sheen.

12:30.433 --> 12:32.400
- Weezy.

12:32.433 --> 12:35.200
I know, I'm gonna take you
to get your nails done.

12:35.233 --> 12:37.734
I have a daughter, Eloise,
and I adopted her,

12:37.767 --> 12:40.200
when she was born,
as a single mom.

12:40.233 --> 12:42.133
There was a rumor at one point

12:42.166 --> 12:45.667
that Eloise was Charlie's child
with a hooker,

12:45.700 --> 12:47.467
and that's false.

12:47.500 --> 12:50.300
- How are things
with Charles?

12:50.333 --> 12:52.133
- When I was going through
my divorce with Charlie,

12:52.166 --> 12:54.767
I was on the cover
of all these tabloids.

12:55.000 --> 12:57.300
It's embarrassing
and humiliating and awful,

12:57.333 --> 13:00.066
and you feel like you need
to defend yourself.

13:00.100 --> 13:02.166
I never anticipated
the journey I would be on

13:02.200 --> 13:05.200
after our divorce,
let me just say that.

13:05.233 --> 13:07.667
- Mom, it's a big deal
getting asked to homecoming.

13:07.700 --> 13:10.233
- You can't date until
you're 16 years old.

13:10.266 --> 13:13.300
- I have a question.
- Yeah, what?

13:13.333 --> 13:16.433
- If a guy asks me to go to
the homecoming dance,

13:16.467 --> 13:18.367
am I allowed to say yes?

13:18.400 --> 13:21.233
- I'll trust your judgment.
- All right, well, whatever.

13:21.266 --> 13:23.000
- You're mad.
- I'm not mad.

13:23.033 --> 13:25.400
- Yeah, I proved you wrong.
- I disagree.

13:25.433 --> 13:26.734
- Okay.

13:28.400 --> 13:31.767
- I'm amazed by
how chill you are.

13:32.000 --> 13:35.133
What is Charlie's reaction
to you being on the show?

13:35.166 --> 13:37.667
- He was very supportive
when I told him I was doing it,

13:37.700 --> 13:40.400
and there were
a couple things I said

13:40.433 --> 13:42.333
that he wasn't
super happy about.

13:42.367 --> 13:44.000
- Why, what did you say?

13:44.033 --> 13:47.333
- Well, I had said
that there was a time

13:47.367 --> 13:49.734
he brought--he called her
a lady of the night,

13:50.000 --> 13:51.133
a hooker, prostitute,
whatever she is.

13:51.166 --> 13:53.000
- Yes.
- And she was lovely.

13:53.033 --> 13:55.066
- Oh, to Thanksgiving?
- Yeah, to Thanksgiving.

13:55.100 --> 13:56.433
Charlie came over
for Thanksgiving

13:56.467 --> 13:58.467
for dinner a few years ago,

13:58.500 --> 14:01.500
and he had a hooker
in the car in the driveway.

14:01.533 --> 14:04.066
[sighs] I said, "I'll set
a ----ing plate."

14:04.100 --> 14:06.000
- You have a thing
for bad boys.

14:06.033 --> 14:09.133
- Uh-uh.
No, I ----ing don't.

14:09.166 --> 14:10.700
- Yeah, you do.

14:10.734 --> 14:14.133
- Even a hooker deserves
to have Thanksgiving dinner.

14:14.166 --> 14:15.467
I said, "Well, I didn't know
it was a secret.

14:15.500 --> 14:17.100
You've been so public..."
- Right.

14:17.133 --> 14:19.333
- "And open about
your ladies of the night,"

14:19.367 --> 14:22.500
and he goes, "Well,
I'm in a different place."

14:22.533 --> 14:25.133
I go, "But people love you
because you are honest,

14:25.166 --> 14:28.467
and that is
a big part of your past."

14:28.500 --> 14:31.100
- Renee from Seattle said,
"Erika, you're a fashionista.

14:31.133 --> 14:32.433
"What do you think
about Denise's

14:32.467 --> 14:34.767
laid-back sense of style?"

14:35.000 --> 14:36.533
- I think it's great.
Everybody should be themselves,

14:36.567 --> 14:38.367
and if she chooses to do
something different,

14:38.400 --> 14:40.033
she ha--you know?

14:40.066 --> 14:41.367
- Well, I want to play
in your closet one day.

14:41.400 --> 14:43.233
- You can come anytime.
- Thank you.

14:43.266 --> 14:45.033
I have dressed up,
but my day-to-day,

14:45.066 --> 14:46.567
as everyone has seen,

14:46.600 --> 14:49.133
I'm really a jeans and
a tank top and T-shirt person.

14:49.166 --> 14:51.233
- Were you surprised when
you showed up in the Bahamas

14:51.266 --> 14:52.433
and the women
were all tricked out?

14:52.467 --> 14:54.767
- Yeah, because I had
crystal shorts on,

14:55.000 --> 14:59.300
and for me they were fancy,
so yeah.

14:59.333 --> 15:01.200
- Nikki from New Jersey said,
"Denise,

15:01.233 --> 15:03.533
"it seems like most women
would need years of therapy

15:03.567 --> 15:05.300
"to deal with Charlie Sheen,

15:05.333 --> 15:07.567
"but nothing about you
seems like a victim.

15:07.600 --> 15:10.367
How are you so good
at hanging with crazy?"

15:10.400 --> 15:12.233
[light chuckles]

15:12.266 --> 15:15.166
- He's my daughters' dad,

15:15.200 --> 15:17.200
and we've been divorced
for 14 years.

15:17.233 --> 15:20.100
- Okay.
- And everything was so crazy--

15:20.133 --> 15:23.066
- Your life, actually,
with him maybe got crazier,

15:23.100 --> 15:24.433
even, after you split up.
- It did get crazier,

15:24.467 --> 15:27.133
and I did not want
our daughters to be privy

15:27.166 --> 15:30.433
to anything that was negative
going on in his life.

15:30.467 --> 15:32.467
After he was diagnosed
with HIV,

15:32.500 --> 15:34.400
the kids did not know
at that point.

15:34.433 --> 15:36.567
I moved in the neighborhood
where he was living,

15:36.600 --> 15:40.400
and being that close to him,
it was very hard.

15:40.433 --> 15:43.100
But anytime
that something would go on

15:43.133 --> 15:45.066
at the house or with him,

15:45.100 --> 15:46.367
he knew he could call me
at 2:00 in the morning,

15:46.400 --> 15:48.400
and I would be there
no matter what.

15:48.433 --> 15:51.066
And a lot of people
judge me for that,

15:51.100 --> 15:53.467
but I wanted him to be the best
dad he could be for him,

15:53.500 --> 15:56.200
for our girls and preserve that

15:56.233 --> 15:58.600
because I have such an amazing
relationship with my father,

15:58.633 --> 16:00.500
so that's why
I always did that.

16:00.533 --> 16:03.066
I'm not a saint,
and I--I do my best,

16:03.100 --> 16:05.367
and I've made a lot
of mistakes with Charlie,

16:05.400 --> 16:09.567
but I think that
it's best to not talk

16:09.600 --> 16:12.567
in such a negative manner
about your children's father

16:12.600 --> 16:16.300
because they're the ones
that suffer ultimately.

16:16.333 --> 16:18.133
- Rinna, you were friends
with Denise through all that.

16:18.166 --> 16:20.600
What--what was
that experience like?

16:20.633 --> 16:23.333
- Well, Denise is a saint,

16:23.367 --> 16:25.166
and I have such respect
for Denise

16:25.200 --> 16:27.233
because it was
a really difficult time.

16:27.266 --> 16:31.266
It was in the press.
It was so public, and--

16:31.300 --> 16:34.066
- But it was a snippet
of what was really going on.

16:34.100 --> 16:35.166
- Right.
- You know?

16:35.200 --> 16:37.033
- Jeez, wow.
- It really was.

16:37.066 --> 16:39.400
- One thing that you said
that really struck me was that

16:39.433 --> 16:43.367
you really could have taken him
to the cleaners in the divorce.

16:43.400 --> 16:45.266
I mean, you could have gotten
a lot more, you said.

16:45.300 --> 16:47.533
- Yeah, I mean, I didn't have
a prenup with Charlie,

16:47.567 --> 16:50.133
and, you know, he got
"Two and a Half Men"

16:50.166 --> 16:52.233
while we were married,
and he had--

16:52.266 --> 16:55.133
- Whoa.
- A big portion of that show.

16:55.166 --> 16:58.300
I never went after half.
- You could have wound up--

16:58.333 --> 17:00.300
you could have wound up
asking for, like,

17:00.333 --> 17:01.400
a piece of his ownership
of that show.

17:01.433 --> 17:02.500
- Oh, yeah, and half
of what he--

17:02.533 --> 17:04.133
- Half.
- Half, yeah.

17:04.165 --> 17:05.532
- And he made a lot of money
off of it.

17:05.567 --> 17:07.433
He had a piece of the show.
- Mm.

17:07.467 --> 17:09.467
How does Aaron
get along with Charlie?

17:09.500 --> 17:12.333
- They actually do get along,
and when we got married,

17:12.367 --> 17:13.666
Aaron called Charlie

17:13.700 --> 17:15.666
to let him know
that we were getting married.

17:15.700 --> 17:16.666
- Wow.
- That's nice.

17:16.700 --> 17:18.165
- Out of respect that he was

17:18.200 --> 17:19.567
gonna be a stepdad
to our girls and--

17:19.599 --> 17:21.233
- That's nice.
- Yeah, they get along.

17:21.266 --> 17:22.200
- Very cool.

17:22.233 --> 17:23.599
- Eloise.
- Yes.

17:23.633 --> 17:25.467
- How is she doing?
- She's doing really good.

17:25.500 --> 17:27.400
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Thank you.

17:27.433 --> 17:29.133
- What does she have?

17:29.166 --> 17:30.533
- Eloise has a chromosome
disorder.

17:30.567 --> 17:32.567
She has a deletion
in chromosome eight,

17:32.600 --> 17:35.300
which has caused
many delays with her,

17:35.333 --> 17:39.300
and it's caused a lot
with speech, development.

17:39.333 --> 17:42.133
- How old was she
when you found that out?

17:42.166 --> 17:47.133
- We found out probably
two years ago exactly.

17:47.166 --> 17:49.433
It was a very difficult thing
to diagnose.

17:49.467 --> 17:51.166
She went through a lot of--

17:51.200 --> 17:52.300
- So she was
missing milestones?

17:52.333 --> 17:54.300
- Yes. It was really hard.

17:54.333 --> 17:58.433
When I saw what was written
on the medical report

17:58.467 --> 18:02.467

26:26.033 --> 26:28.300
It looked good.
- That was really funny.

26:28.333 --> 26:31.066
- Remember when we went
up the hill?

26:31.100 --> 26:32.266
- You know what?
- What hill?

26:32.300 --> 26:33.667
- Like Jack and Jill?
- What?

26:33.700 --> 26:36.266
[laughter]

26:36.300 --> 26:38.000
- I can't.

26:38.033 --> 26:39.266
- I ever tell you the joke
that I have--

26:39.300 --> 26:41.166
- Shut up.
- Please tell us the joke.

26:41.200 --> 26:43.000
- No, I can't
with your dumb jokes, no.

26:43.033 --> 26:45.133
- Kyle.
- Yes. Let me tell my joke.

26:45.166 --> 26:46.767
You want to tell it--or you
want to hear it, or you don't?

26:47.000 --> 26:50.133
- I want to hear it.
- All right.

26:50.166 --> 26:52.400
I forgot the joke.
- Oh, no!

26:52.433 --> 26:53.767
[laughter]

26:54.000 --> 26:55.100
- I was really--
- Did you forget it?

26:55.133 --> 26:57.100
- No!

26:57.133 --> 26:59.400
- That was the best.

26:59.433 --> 27:02.300
- Apparently the crew
was laughing so hard

27:02.333 --> 27:04.000
that they had a problem
with the audio.

27:04.033 --> 27:05.200
- They did.

27:05.233 --> 27:07.033
- Because they were all
howling.

Emily from South Bend,

your honeymoon in Switzerland?"

27:14.133 --> 27:17.033
I love skiing,
so we had an amazing time.

27:17.066 --> 27:18.667
It's just a fantastic place
to go.

27:18.700 --> 27:20.266

to skiing.

27:20.300 --> 27:21.700

1,200-square-foot mobile home

27:26.734 --> 27:29.066
you lived in temporarily.
What was that like?"

27:29.100 --> 27:30.700
- It's nice.
It's got great views,

27:30.734 --> 27:33.100
and we're comfortable.
I'm still in it.

27:33.133 --> 27:34.233
- Oh, you're still in it?

27:34.266 --> 27:35.767
- Yeah.
- Wow.

27:36.000 --> 27:37.700
- We haven't moved into
the beach house yet.

27:37.734 --> 27:41.033
- There was a time
in season one where you said

27:41.066 --> 27:45.066
of your temporary New York
apartment that I believe was,

27:45.100 --> 27:48.000
like, 3,500 square feet
or something like that,

27:48.033 --> 27:50.333
you said you could not live
in that square footage.

27:50.367 --> 27:52.166
- It'd be uncomfortable
with two young kids, yeah.

27:52.200 --> 27:54.100
Can you believe it?
- How many bedrooms?

27:54.133 --> 27:56.300
- There's only three.
It's small.

27:56.333 --> 27:58.400
- So this is like--you can't--
- For us, it's small.

27:58.433 --> 27:59.734
This is a small apartment
for us.

27:59.767 --> 28:01.333
- So the kids are sharing
a room?

28:01.367 --> 28:03.333
- Yes, they're sharing a room.
How cute is this?

28:03.367 --> 28:05.100
How times have changed.

28:05.133 --> 28:07.200
[laughter]

28:07.233 --> 28:09.066
Well, I had an estate then.

I feel like I live
in my own private retreat,

28:11.333 --> 28:13.133
17 acres total.

28:13.166 --> 28:15.233
We have a pool,
a tennis court.

28:15.266 --> 28:18.767
Past the barn and into
the stable, here we go.

28:19.000 --> 28:21.200
So I went from
a grand estate to--

28:21.233 --> 28:23.033
- 3,500 square feet.

28:23.066 --> 28:25.166
A little bit earlier,
I was talking to Denise

28:25.200 --> 28:29.100
about her philosophy
about raising kids

28:29.133 --> 28:33.400
with a ex-husband
who's always in the news.

28:33.433 --> 28:35.000

"Watch Denise
in her interviews.

28:36.400 --> 28:39.233
She's always, like--
makes it about the kids,"

28:39.266 --> 28:41.433
and my mom was like, "That's
the classy way to do it."

28:41.467 --> 28:43.333
- Leslie from Naples,
Florida, said,

28:43.367 --> 28:46.266
"What is the real reason
you won't give up 'Grammer'?"

28:46.300 --> 28:48.300
- The primary reason
is for my kids.

28:48.333 --> 28:51.433
That's it.
It's really--it's just my kids.

28:51.467 --> 28:53.734
- I couldn't wait
to get rid of mine.

28:53.767 --> 28:55.400
Sorry.
- I think that's great.

28:55.433 --> 28:57.333
- I filed a bifurcation
so I could go back

28:57.367 --> 28:58.367
to my maiden name.
- Yeah, you told us that.

28:58.400 --> 29:00.033
- You did?
- Yeah.

29:00.066 --> 29:01.233
- So I took it off.

29:01.266 --> 29:03.066
I took "Grammer"
off my social media,

29:03.100 --> 29:05.233
and it's still
on my passport, and--

29:05.266 --> 29:06.734
- How does David
feel about that?

29:06.767 --> 29:09.533
- David is all for it.
He said, "Your kids,

29:09.567 --> 29:11.367
"both of your kids' last name
is Grammer.

29:11.400 --> 29:15.000
I understand that."
He has no problem.

29:15.033 --> 29:17.300
- By the way,
what was your reaction to

29:17.333 --> 29:22.100
Denise not having a prenup in
her marriage to Charlie Sheen?

29:22.133 --> 29:24.500
- Charlie and I didn't have
a prenup when we got married,

29:24.533 --> 29:26.166
and when we got divorced,

29:26.200 --> 29:28.400
I could have asked for half
of what he made,

29:28.433 --> 29:30.166

29:30.200 --> 29:32.300

29:35.433 --> 29:36.533

were you married?

29:36.567 --> 29:39.033
- Just under five.
- Okay.

29:39.066 --> 29:40.400
Do you think she should
have asked for half?

29:40.433 --> 29:42.266
- I don't know.

29:42.300 --> 29:44.467
- Charlie Sheen came up
when she was with him.

29:44.500 --> 29:48.100

before we got married.

[laughter]

34:36.699 --> 34:39.400
- So how big is it?
- No.

34:39.433 --> 34:42.000
- Is it like Shaquille?
- Compare it to this shoe.

34:42.033 --> 34:44.367
- No, I--it's actually bigger
than your shoe.

34:44.400 --> 34:45.699
[all yelling]
- I do--wait, it's--

34:45.734 --> 34:47.300
- You missed that.
- What did you say?

34:47.333 --> 34:48.533
- I said, compare it
to my shoe,

34:48.567 --> 34:49.567
and she says it's bigger
than the shoe.

34:49.600 --> 34:51.233
- [gasps]

34:51.266 --> 34:52.367
- Wait, I do want
to clarify something.

34:52.400 --> 34:53.632
- Wait a minute here.
Hold on.

34:53.667 --> 34:55.233
- Please don't tell me
hard or soft.

34:55.266 --> 34:56.233
- I have to clarify this,
please,

34:56.266 --> 34:57.467
because of his business.

34:57.500 --> 34:58.767
- Which part of the shoe?
- And it's true.

34:59.000 --> 35:01.533
It was after a date,
and no one was there,

35:01.567 --> 35:02.734
so it wasn't like it was
in the middle of the day.

35:02.767 --> 35:04.300
- After business hours.
- Yeah.

35:04.333 --> 35:05.433
- Do you regret bringing it up?

35:05.467 --> 35:06.734
I mean, it's good PR for Aaron.

35:06.767 --> 35:09.000
- I don't regret,
actually, anything.

35:09.033 --> 35:10.667
At first he was like...
[gasps]

35:10.700 --> 35:12.700
And then now I think he's glad
that I said it, so...

35:12.734 --> 35:14.567
- Uh, yeah.
- Now that he's racing up

35:14.600 --> 35:16.700
the charts and the hot meter.
He's like, bring it on.

35:16.734 --> 35:21.233
- Now that he's winning polls
on "Watch What Happens Live."

35:21.266 --> 35:24.300
- Ladies, on a scale of Denise
having sex every single day

35:24.333 --> 35:26.000
and Teddi doing it
two times a week,

35:26.033 --> 35:27.600
where do the rest of you fall?

35:27.633 --> 35:29.333
- Not near Denise.
- In between.

35:29.367 --> 35:30.433
- Not near Denise.
- Not near Denise.

35:30.467 --> 35:31.734
- Really?
- Yeah.

35:31.767 --> 35:33.767
- Denise is the MVP
of this group.

35:34.000 --> 35:35.734
- Pete from Tucson,
Arizona, said,

35:35.767 --> 35:38.266
"Rinna, you're infamous
for your own racy posts.

35:38.300 --> 35:39.533
"What did you think about

35:39.567 --> 35:41.767
"Denise's husband
appreciation day post

35:42.000 --> 35:45.266
where Aaron is clearly
giving a full salute in bed?"

35:45.300 --> 35:47.734
- It's so sexy and hot.
Like, I'm almost embarrassed

35:47.767 --> 35:49.500
to look at it,
you know what I mean?

35:49.533 --> 35:51.333
- Did you take it down?
- I did take it down.

35:51.367 --> 35:52.567
- Why?
- You did?

35:52.600 --> 35:54.066
- I like it. I actually--

35:54.100 --> 35:56.266
- Did he not--
- No, he was fine.

35:56.300 --> 35:57.734
- The girls maybe?
The girls?

35:57.767 --> 36:01.033
- You know, the kids
kind of saw something.

36:01.066 --> 36:02.500
- Oh, oh.
- I--yeah, I see.

36:02.533 --> 36:04.433
- Yeah.
- Well, it was hard to miss.

36:04.467 --> 36:05.500
- I get it. I get that.
- All right.

36:05.533 --> 36:07.367
Henry from Blair, Nebraska,

36:07.400 --> 36:09.367
wants to know, "Rinna,
what do you and Harry Hamlin do

36:09.400 --> 36:12.266
to keep things spicy
after 22 years of marriage?"

36:12.300 --> 36:16.734
- Well, Harry Hamlin and I,
you know,

36:16.767 --> 36:18.767
we like to do some kinky sh--.
- Really?

36:19.000 --> 36:20.533
- Whoo!
- I'll dress up.

36:20.567 --> 36:22.100
- Do you role play?
- Oh, (BLEEP) yes.

36:22.133 --> 36:24.066
- I knew it.

36:24.100 --> 36:25.600
- Listen, I like to role play.
- I was about to say role play.

36:25.633 --> 36:27.600
- I love it!

36:27.633 --> 36:29.700
- Pat the puss, honey.

36:29.734 --> 36:31.467
I dance for him.

36:31.500 --> 36:33.000
I took Sheila Kelley's
strip class

36:33.033 --> 36:35.266
for two years, honey.
I can ----ing move,

36:35.300 --> 36:36.767
and let me tell you something.

36:37.000 --> 36:38.467
All you have to do
is bend over.

36:38.500 --> 36:40.066
That's all you have to do.

36:40.100 --> 36:42.433
Like, just take your clothes
off and bend over.

36:42.467 --> 36:43.767
That's it.
It's easy.

36:44.000 --> 36:45.700
- That's a good trick, Rinna.

36:47.433 --> 36:49.000
- Coming up...

36:49.033 --> 36:51.533
For someone who is the queen
of accountability,

36:51.567 --> 36:53.333
you had such a lapse,
so to speak.

36:53.367 --> 36:55.500
- I'm taking accountability
of--for it right now.

36:55.533 --> 36:56.700
- Right.

37:03.333 --> 37:04.066
- Welcome back to the "Real

37:04.066 --> 37:04.533
- Welcome back to the "Real
Housewives of Beverly Hills"

37:05.467 --> 37:06.700
reunion.

37:06.734 --> 37:08.467
Well, the battle
between Lisa Vanderpump

37:08.500 --> 37:10.333
and her former Teddi Bear

37:10.367 --> 37:13.567
started with a biting
Lucy Lucy Apple Juice

37:13.600 --> 37:17.467
and ended in a John Blizzard
of lies.

37:17.500 --> 37:19.400
Take a look.

37:19.433 --> 37:21.367
- Teddi Bear?

37:21.400 --> 37:24.633
- You could go from Teddi Bear
to Teddi Bitch in a nanosecond.

37:26.200 --> 37:30.066
- Bring her here.
Oh, baby.

37:30.100 --> 37:32.500
- That's her?
- Yeah, yeah.

37:32.533 --> 37:34.533
You don't recognize this...
- Stop.

37:34.567 --> 37:36.200
- Is that a--
- I don't want to talk about it.

37:36.233 --> 37:37.467
- What?
- What?

37:37.500 --> 37:39.000
- No.
- Okay.

37:39.033 --> 37:41.734
- After Lucy had bit the kids
a few times

37:41.767 --> 37:46.467
and took a big bite
out of PK's face, PK was just--

37:46.500 --> 37:48.066
- Like, "Maybe we should find
Lucy another place?"

37:48.100 --> 37:49.734
- Yes, exactly.

37:49.767 --> 37:53.066
I tried to rescue a dog
from Vanderpump Dog Center,

37:53.100 --> 37:55.033
and it blew up in my face.

37:55.066 --> 37:57.567
Here I am thinking that she's
going to this beautiful home.

37:57.600 --> 37:59.500
I get a phone call from Lisa

37:59.533 --> 38:02.633
that Lucy ended up
in a shelter.

38:02.667 --> 38:04.600
- When we went into
Vanderpump Dogs,

38:04.633 --> 38:08.500
John pranced your dog out
and told me and Kyle.

38:08.533 --> 38:11.533
It was not my fault
that this is out there.

38:11.567 --> 38:13.567
- I had no idea Teddi
would be gossiping.

38:13.600 --> 38:16.100
- Don't turn this around on me.

38:16.133 --> 38:19.033
- I did not tell my employees
to tell you.

38:19.066 --> 38:23.100
[dramatic music]

38:23.133 --> 38:25.100
- "Didn't Lisa want you
to tell me?"

38:25.133 --> 38:26.500
- Who?
- "Yes."

38:26.533 --> 38:29.500
- Who from?
- From John Blizzard.

38:29.533 --> 38:31.500
I did nothing wrong.

38:31.533 --> 38:33.767
I am an honest person.

38:34.000 --> 38:35.500
Never once have I told a lie,

38:35.533 --> 38:38.500
and never will you ever hear me
tell one.

38:38.533 --> 38:40.100
- I went to Blizzard,
and I got him

38:40.133 --> 38:42.433
to print all of her texts
and all of his texts.

38:42.467 --> 38:44.233
- She says, "Have the dog there

38:44.266 --> 38:46.400
and I can say
it looks like Dorit's dog."

38:46.433 --> 38:48.500
- She's a ----ing liar.

38:48.533 --> 38:49.767
- I can't believe this.

38:50.000 --> 38:52.233
You have complicated my life.

38:52.266 --> 38:54.667
Clearly, you seem to be
a lot closer to Teddi.

38:54.700 --> 38:58.233
- Yeah. I put words in
your mouth that were not true,

38:58.266 --> 39:00.133
and I will own that,
and I'm sorry for it.

39:00.166 --> 39:03.000
- The only thing I've got
to say to little Teddi Bear

39:03.033 --> 39:05.133
is she's guilty by omission.

39:05.166 --> 39:06.667
- How did you know
that Teddi knew?

39:06.700 --> 39:08.133
- I didn't know at the time
Teddi knew.

39:08.166 --> 39:09.667
She didn't know at the time.

39:09.700 --> 39:11.500
- But you said that they sent
a text saying...

39:11.533 --> 39:14.266
- No, no, no. That--no, that--
- To her, Teddi knows.

39:14.300 --> 39:15.567
So who told you?

39:15.600 --> 39:17.734
Obviously Lisa
and John Blizzard

39:17.767 --> 39:19.667
had a whole conversation
going on about that.

39:19.700 --> 39:23.100
- So you don't feel any kind
of guilt or remorse?

39:23.133 --> 39:25.133
- I don't feel
any guilt with you.

39:25.166 --> 39:27.467
- Oh, really?
- No. I feel betrayed by you.

39:27.500 --> 39:29.233
- Okay. Well, I feel betrayed
by you too.

39:29.266 --> 39:32.667
- Oh, 'cause I couldn't carry
out your plan? Sorry.

39:32.700 --> 39:34.166
- Lisa Vanderpump
may have made

39:34.200 --> 39:36.533
a critical error
in judgment here.

39:36.567 --> 39:39.266
I think she thought Teddi was
a punk and was gonna fold up

39:39.300 --> 39:42.000
and do exactly
what she wanted her to do.

39:42.033 --> 39:43.567
- I did fine
before Teddi Mellencamp,

39:43.600 --> 39:47.000
and I'll do fine after.

39:47.033 --> 39:48.467
- I'm gonna call it
a night, guys.

39:50.133 --> 39:51.767
- Bye, Teddi.

39:54.266 --> 39:57.166
- Teddi, we saw everything
that happened on-camera.

39:57.200 --> 39:59.000
From your point of view,

39:59.033 --> 40:02.300
what happened off-camera
before the season even started?

40:02.333 --> 40:06.600
- Well, before I say anything,
I need to once again apologize.

40:06.633 --> 40:09.000
I made a mistake.

40:09.033 --> 40:10.233
Well, actually, I should have
never gotten involved

40:10.266 --> 40:12.000
in the very first place.

40:12.033 --> 40:13.300
- Why did you get involved
in the beginning though?

40:13.333 --> 40:15.166
- And this--and this is truth.

40:15.200 --> 40:17.533
You know, when I first got
the phone call and it was,

40:17.567 --> 40:19.734
"Hey, you know, we--
Lisa wanted us to tell you

40:19.767 --> 40:22.266
"because she knows that things
aren't good with you and Dorit,

40:22.300 --> 40:24.600
"and it would be weird for her
to bring it up because

40:24.633 --> 40:26.600
"Dorit is one of
her good friends.

40:26.633 --> 40:29.066
"The dog ended up
in a kill shelter.

40:29.100 --> 40:31.100
We gotta figure out a way
to make it happen."

40:31.133 --> 40:32.533
- That was the phone call
you got?

40:32.567 --> 40:34.166
- Yes.
- And so why did you--

40:34.200 --> 40:36.133
- But there was multiple,
multiple phone calls.

40:36.166 --> 40:38.333
- From?
- From John Blizzard.

40:38.367 --> 40:39.700
- John Blizzard.
- But also, "Hold on.

40:39.734 --> 40:41.133
"I'm on another line
with Sessa.

40:41.166 --> 40:42.133
"Hold on. I'm on
the other line with Lisa.

40:42.166 --> 40:43.734
Let me check with them."

40:43.767 --> 40:46.033
I mean, there was--I mean,
so much going into it.

40:46.066 --> 40:47.633
- And so to Denise's point,

40:47.667 --> 40:49.200
why get involved?
Why agree to it?

40:49.233 --> 40:51.033
- Because I was petty,
and I made a mistake,

40:51.066 --> 40:53.600
and I was angry at Dorit.
- What were you angry about?

40:53.633 --> 40:55.567
- We had a whole past year
of issues,

40:55.600 --> 40:58.767
and there was something
that happened last year

40:59.000 --> 41:00.667
when we were actually
leaving the reunion,

41:00.700 --> 41:02.633
and Kyle was on the phone
with Lisa Vanderpump,

41:02.667 --> 41:05.000
and we were all supposed
to meet, and she goes,

41:05.033 --> 41:08.100
"Dorit refuses to go
if Teddi's there," and I--

41:08.133 --> 41:09.533
- I did say that.

41:09.567 --> 41:11.033
- And I was angry,
and you know what?

41:11.066 --> 41:14.033
I made a mistake,
and I acted out.

41:14.066 --> 41:16.100
- I just don't understand

41:16.133 --> 41:18.533
why you never spoke to Lisa
about it,

41:18.567 --> 41:20.767
why you were always speaking
to the employee.

41:21.000 --> 41:22.600
Like--
- Well...

41:22.633 --> 41:24.100
- Hadn't you gotten close
to John Blizzard?

41:24.133 --> 41:25.533
- No. I never was close to--
- Oh.

41:25.567 --> 41:27.000
- I would go there
because my kids

41:27.033 --> 41:28.633
go to a class right near there.

41:28.667 --> 41:31.333
I had never gone to dinner
with him or drinks

41:31.367 --> 41:33.233
or done anything outside
of a Vanderpump event.

41:33.266 --> 41:36.000
- But then that makes it
all the more weird to me

41:36.033 --> 41:37.533
that you never spoke
to Lisa about it.

41:37.567 --> 41:39.400
- Because it was--
that's my point.

41:39.433 --> 41:42.767
I didn't think twice about it
because her head guy is saying,

41:43.000 --> 41:45.667
"I'm talking to her right now
trying to figure this out."

41:45.700 --> 41:48.266
This was all Lisa wanting Dorit
to look bad,

41:48.300 --> 41:50.300
and yes, I went along with it.

41:50.333 --> 41:52.667
Like, I am not for one second

41:52.700 --> 41:55.100
trying to dismiss
my bad behavior.

41:55.133 --> 41:56.266
- Erika, last--
- Yes?

41:56.300 --> 41:58.700
- Erika?
- I'm sorry. Yes? Yes?

41:58.734 --> 42:02.600
- Last year you said that Teddi
was not to be trusted.

42:02.633 --> 42:05.033
- You are much more calculating
than you're saying.

42:05.066 --> 42:08.266
You are not this innocent fawn
in the woods.

42:08.300 --> 42:12.400
I did not realize
how much Teddi disliked Dorit,

42:12.433 --> 42:18.133
and it was mean to have gone
far enough down that road.

42:18.166 --> 42:20.000
- That's a serious--
for someone

42:20.033 --> 42:22.767
who is the queen of
accountability, so to speak--

42:23.000 --> 42:24.767
- I'm taking accountability
of--for it right now.

42:25.000 --> 42:26.233
- Right, but it's amazing

42:26.266 --> 42:28.667
that at that time
you had such a lapse.

42:28.700 --> 42:33.100
- I think that, you know,
what also really stuck with me

42:33.133 --> 42:35.066
was that, you know,
I'd kept asking,

42:35.100 --> 42:37.333
"Well, at what point
did you realize

42:37.367 --> 42:38.700
you didn't want to go
through with it?"

42:38.734 --> 42:40.367
And then at Vanderpump Dogs

42:40.400 --> 42:43.200
when I saw that Lisa said,
"No, no, no,"

42:43.233 --> 42:46.266
and that I was just gonna be
the one that was a scapegoat,

42:46.300 --> 42:48.266
I thought to myself, "Wow,

42:48.300 --> 42:50.600
it wasn't actually
your conscience,"

42:50.633 --> 42:53.300
and thought, "I don't want to
do this to Dorit."

42:53.333 --> 42:57.266
It was, "I don't want to be the
only one to do this to Dorit,"

42:57.300 --> 42:59.066
and that hurt.

43:02.100 --> 43:03.734
- Next time, it's part two

43:03.767 --> 43:06.767
of the "Real Housewives
of Beverly Hills" reunion.

43:07.000 --> 43:09.300
- I hate it when people say,
"What work have you had done?"

43:09.333 --> 43:11.066
What work have you had done?

43:11.100 --> 43:12.400
- Well, I think
it's comical people think

43:12.433 --> 43:14.767
that I've had
a facelift and surgeries.

43:15.000 --> 43:16.166
- You didn't have
a head transplant?

43:16.200 --> 43:18.033
- I did not have--
[laughter]

43:18.066 --> 43:20.633
- Drunk Rinna's really
pretty fun.

43:20.667 --> 43:21.767
- I agree.

43:22.000 --> 43:23.333
Why do you two think

43:23.367 --> 43:26.200
that Erika doesn't want to be
around you?

43:26.233 --> 43:28.100
- Teddi was up Kyle's ass.

43:28.133 --> 43:31.200
As soon as Lisa Vanderpump
was out, you were right there.

43:31.233 --> 43:33.133
- Camille, you are confusing.

43:33.166 --> 43:36.033
- You girls want me to jump
on that hate train.

43:36.066 --> 43:37.233
- That's not true.

43:37.266 --> 43:39.133
- You do a good job
on your own.

43:39.166 --> 43:41.767
- Dorit, you're the most
phoniest person I've ever met.

43:42.000 --> 43:44.166
You said, I curse at my
daughters. It was no big deal.

43:44.200 --> 43:45.433
- I don't curse
at my daughters.

43:45.467 --> 43:46.433
- It was in the Bahamas.
You were drunk.

43:46.467 --> 43:48.133
You came in.

43:48.166 --> 43:50.133
- This is where we think
before we speak, Camille.

43:50.166 --> 43:51.467
- This is totally a setup.
- What is a setup?

43:51.500 --> 43:53.200
- I'm done. I'm done.
- A setup?

43:53.233 --> 43:54.700
- No, what are
you talking about?

43:54.734 --> 43:56.734
- I'm done.
- What are you talking about?

43:56.767 --> 43:59.367
- I'm done.
- She's ----ing nuts.

43:59.400 --> 44:02.100
- Those ----ing nasty bitches.

44:02.133 --> 44:03.767
