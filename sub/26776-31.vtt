21:01.326 --> 21:03.929
- Well said, Henry.
- Thank you, Henry.

21:03.996 --> 21:05.797
- Nope, I was actually
talking to Henry.

21:05.864 --> 21:08.900
- Happens a lot.

21:08.967 --> 21:10.335
{\an8}[ in unison ]
- Ohhh!

21:10.402 --> 21:14.373
{\an8}- I'm taking this boot.

21:19.044 --> 21:22.681
{\an8}- What. The Henry.
Was that?!

21:22.748 --> 21:24.516
{\an8}- That was not a Henryyyyy!

21:24.583 --> 21:26.852
{\an8}- And it just
took my Henry-nos Boot!

21:26.918 --> 21:28.387
{\an8}- I don't like that.
