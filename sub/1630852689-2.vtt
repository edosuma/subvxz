Raise your guard! Raise your guard!

00:11.928 --> 00:13.847
There you go, boy. That's it!

00:14.639 --> 00:16.182
- Thanks, Joca.
- See you.

00:18.768 --> 00:19.769
See you.

00:27.068 --> 00:29.112
Keep it real, Zilda.
I'll be back tomorrow.

00:29.904 --> 00:31.114
Go, Corinthians.

00:52.135 --> 00:54.596
- Hey, Lú. How are you?

00:55.263 --> 00:57.265
Tomorrow is Thursday. Don't forget.

00:57.349 --> 00:59.017
Dad has a surprise for you.

00:59.601 --> 01:00.643
Take care.

01:09.319 --> 01:12.405
What about that phone, rich kid?
I like it. Give it to me. It's mine now.

01:12.489 --> 01:15.325
- Are you tripping? I'm from around here.
- Quick, asshole.

01:15.408 --> 01:16.701
- I'm from the block.
- Come on, damn it.

01:16.785 --> 01:18.745
- You're done! You're done!
- Easy.

01:23.541 --> 01:24.876
Come on, asshole.

01:24.959 --> 01:26.211
Come on!

01:36.971 --> 01:39.683
Hey, everybody! Take a good look
at the face of this loser right here!

01:39.766 --> 01:41.142
Go on, punk. Get inside.

01:44.729 --> 01:48.650
Take a good look at this loser's face,
the new little thief on the block.

01:51.569 --> 01:54.114
- Stop it.
- Are you for real? Stand the fuck up!

01:57.075 --> 01:59.077
- Stand up.
- I don't wanna fight, man.

01:59.744 --> 02:00.995
Let me go.

02:01.079 --> 02:04.082
This life you've chosen will kill you.
Let's learn how to defend ourselves.

02:04.874 --> 02:06.710
Come on. Keep your guard up and come here.

02:08.211 --> 02:09.337
Keep your guard up.

02:09.421 --> 02:10.755
Let me go.

02:10.839 --> 02:12.090
No. Keep your guard up.

02:12.173 --> 02:14.134
- Keep your guard up. Steady!
- What the hell is this?

02:14.217 --> 02:15.218
- Come on!
- Let me go.

02:15.301 --> 02:17.303
You won't leave for shit!
Keep your guard up! Go!

02:18.304 --> 02:20.724
Come on, man. Keep your guard up.

02:20.807 --> 02:22.350
What's up?

02:23.351 --> 02:25.103
Come the fuck on! Let's go!

02:25.186 --> 02:28.565
Guard up! Come on, damn it!

02:31.985 --> 02:34.738
Wow. Look at the guy.

02:37.866 --> 02:39.993
If you really wanna learn,
come back tomorrow.

02:47.125 --> 02:49.127
Rafael,
one day you're gonna get yourself killed.

02:49.210 --> 02:52.130
Not a day before, not a day after.

03:22.077 --> 03:24.454
Good morning, André.
Good morning, Tarsila.

03:29.918 --> 03:31.336


03:35.965 --> 03:37.717
Good morning, Paula.

03:43.306 --> 03:46.476
I brought you your pills.
You have to take them on an empty stomach.

03:50.438 --> 03:53.566
I feel great.
I don't need any more medicine. I'm fine.

03:53.650 --> 03:56.277
Yes, you do. Come on.

03:57.445 --> 03:58.863
It's a beautiful day out.

04:14.170 --> 04:17.007
<i>A quick procedure,</i>

04:17.590 --> 04:20.093

04:20.176 --> 04:23.430
in which we can activate
areas of the brain

04:23.513 --> 04:26.141
without the need of any medication.

04:30.395 --> 04:34.149
<i>Patients</i>

04:39.237 --> 04:42.282

this device,

04:47.370 --> 04:52.375
is only possible
thanks to our brain-mapping research.

04:54.294 --> 04:58.506
No! Let me go!

05:08.600 --> 05:10.268
Good morning, Consul.

05:13.646 --> 05:15.023
Are you hungry?

05:15.690 --> 05:16.900
Sit down.

05:35.210 --> 05:36.461
What's the matter?

05:39.881 --> 05:41.424
What did you expect?

05:42.967 --> 05:44.469
Bacon?

06:07.492 --> 06:09.577
Next time,
I'll let him go through with it.

<i>I've been calling since yesterday.</i>

06:51.911 --> 06:54.330
<i>You didn't show up to practice,</i>

06:54.831 --> 06:57.584

07:57.602 --> 07:58.603
Hello.

07:59.562 --> 08:02.190
<i>Hello, Camila? This is Rafael.</i>
<i>How are you?</i>

08:03.108 --> 08:04.150
Hi, Rafael.

08:05.318 --> 08:06.861
Things are okay, I guess.

08:07.445 --> 08:11.908
Camila, I… I'm trying to find Lúcia,
but I haven't been able to reach her.

08:11.991 --> 08:13.159
<i>Can you help me?</i>

08:15.995 --> 08:18.498
Rafael,
I don't know how to tell you this.

08:20.000 --> 08:22.127
<i>Lúcia was in an accident.</i>

08:22.836 --> 08:25.463
<i>Her car flipped over,</i>
<i>and she didn't make it.</i>

08:50.530 --> 08:52.282
The road was very slippery.

08:53.658 --> 08:55.118
Lots of fog.

08:57.078 --> 08:58.955
Her car flipped over.

09:05.420 --> 09:06.796
She lost control, Paula.

09:06.880 --> 09:07.881
No.

09:09.674 --> 09:12.218
There was someone following her.
I know there was.

09:16.473 --> 09:19.976
She was in a diner
before the accident, alone.

09:21.186 --> 09:22.520
I've checked.

09:24.939 --> 09:26.191
I went there.

09:36.701 --> 09:38.119
This guy!

09:40.080 --> 09:41.873
I saw this guy!

09:41.956 --> 09:45.293
Saw him how, Paula?
You can't even see his face.

09:45.377 --> 09:47.045
I saw him yesterday!

09:48.421 --> 09:50.465
Yesterday he was here, right behind me.

09:51.132 --> 09:52.592
I ran from him.

09:52.676 --> 09:55.053
Yesterday you were completely
knocked out from your meds.

09:55.136 --> 09:58.932
I also dreamed about him
on the night of Lúcia's accident.

10:00.725 --> 10:01.768
You dreamed about it?

10:03.520 --> 10:05.063
I'm serious, Marques.

10:05.563 --> 10:08.191
I'm telling you the truth.
You have to believe me.

10:08.274 --> 10:10.318
Have you seen Lúcia's body?

10:12.195 --> 10:13.905
Lúcia's body is at the morgue.

10:13.988 --> 10:15.949
How do you know it's her?

10:18.785 --> 10:22.163
I need all the material on Lúcia's case,

10:22.247 --> 10:24.165
everything you have.

10:24.249 --> 10:26.042
Ask Camila to send it to me.

10:26.126 --> 10:28.461
Why? This isn't gonna do you any good--

10:28.545 --> 10:29.754
Just ask her!

10:29.838 --> 10:32.674
Okay? Please?

10:35.260 --> 10:38.304
Paula, you have to accept it.

10:38.388 --> 10:42.475
I'll accept it when I have proof
in front of me that my daughter is dead!

10:48.106 --> 10:49.190
All right.

10:50.775 --> 10:51.860
Okay.

10:54.779 --> 10:56.364
I'll talk to Camila.

11:04.205 --> 11:05.540
Take care, okay?

11:06.583 --> 11:07.709
Marques…

11:13.173 --> 11:14.632
how do you do it?

11:18.011 --> 11:19.054
Do what?

11:21.306 --> 11:22.515
Accept it.

11:26.144 --> 11:27.437
One day at a time.

11:28.813 --> 11:30.482
Do you still dream about her?

11:33.109 --> 11:36.905
The truth is,
when life takes one of your children away…

11:39.616 --> 11:41.659
nothing is left but reality.

11:45.622 --> 11:47.457
And that's what you need to accept.

12:14.025 --> 12:16.236
- Hi, Rafael.
- Hi, Virgínia. Is the senator there?

12:16.319 --> 12:18.863
- He's busy.
- Great. Tell him I'm coming in.

12:30.208 --> 12:33.044
Back to the past

12:33.128 --> 12:34.337
Hi, Senator.

12:35.505 --> 12:37.924
For you to show up here,
it must be important.

12:41.094 --> 12:43.847
What? Have you snorted
your allowance already?

12:48.143 --> 12:49.602
Lúcia's dead.

12:50.520 --> 12:53.857
The granddaughter you've always ignored.
My daughter.

12:59.654 --> 13:00.947
Are you happy now?

13:05.118 --> 13:06.286
I'm sorry.

13:10.290 --> 13:13.251
- Tell me, Rafael. How much do you need?
- I don't want your money.

13:14.544 --> 13:16.546
Paula was admitted
to a psychiatric clinic.

13:17.213 --> 13:19.341
I need authorization to go in there.

13:21.801 --> 13:22.802
It's important.

13:26.598 --> 13:27.724
Help me.

13:36.358 --> 13:38.985
- Come in.

13:45.116 --> 13:46.242
What's this?

13:46.326 --> 13:47.619
Surprise.

13:48.411 --> 13:50.914
- What kind of surprise?
- The bad kind.

13:51.498 --> 13:54.584
That journalist who lost his finger,
Barcellos,

13:54.668 --> 13:56.169
he's suing us.

13:57.545 --> 13:59.756
You said you had a surprise.

14:01.383 --> 14:04.969
The surprise is that this lawsuit

14:05.053 --> 14:07.514
comes with an accusation
of malicious intent.

14:09.724 --> 14:11.017
Don't worry.

14:11.601 --> 14:13.645
This is all part of his act.

14:13.728 --> 14:15.313
Schedule a meeting with him.

14:15.814 --> 14:17.399
Let's hear what he has to say.

14:37.877 --> 14:39.629
Are you sure
you want to take this to Paula?

14:39.713 --> 14:41.589
She asked me for it, so I'm doing it.

14:46.553 --> 14:48.763
She's already not very well, isn't she,
Camila?

14:48.847 --> 14:50.807
Don't you think
this will make things worse?

14:52.434 --> 14:53.893
That's her decision to make.

14:56.813 --> 14:58.690
CRIME SCENE INVESTIGATOR
FORENSICS

15:12.787 --> 15:14.581
The senses, Paula…

15:16.791 --> 15:18.543
they're like muscles.

15:19.044 --> 15:21.212
If you don't use them, they atrophy.

15:27.135 --> 15:30.847
You can also atrophy
an experience you've had.

15:33.391 --> 15:37.395
You can get things crossed,
mix up dreaming and reality.

15:40.607 --> 15:42.650
So you think yesterday was just a dream?

15:44.319 --> 15:46.321
That I didn't actually see any of that?

15:50.658 --> 15:53.620
Some dreams look just like reality.

15:54.871 --> 15:56.373
Especially your dreams.

16:02.379 --> 16:04.547
I believe in you, Paula.

16:07.717 --> 16:11.638
And here, we can investigate your dreams.

16:14.265 --> 16:18.853
I promise I'll help you with this,
but you have to trust me.

16:30.115 --> 16:31.491
What's that guy doing?

16:33.243 --> 16:35.578
He's enjoying his own reality.

16:37.539 --> 16:39.666
What do you mean?
Is he daydreaming?

16:41.209 --> 16:45.296
Daydreaming, dreaming, enjoying.

16:46.381 --> 16:49.676
Reality is what your senses perceive.

16:52.303 --> 16:55.056
So what happens
when you remove the blindfolds?

16:55.140 --> 16:59.019
I wouldn't know. It's been five years
since the last time he took them off.

17:01.980 --> 17:03.023
Doctor.

17:10.196 --> 17:11.406
Talk to him.

17:12.699 --> 17:14.868
I bet you'll find him interesting.

17:41.061 --> 17:43.396
I like what you do with your hair.

17:46.316 --> 17:47.484
What's your name?

17:49.736 --> 17:51.738
- Paula.
- Paula.

17:53.656 --> 17:55.992
Nice meeting you, Paula. I'm Lucas.

18:02.123 --> 18:03.833
- Lucas.
- Yeah.

18:05.794 --> 18:07.212
What's going on there?

18:07.712 --> 18:10.757
Here, things happen
exactly as I want them to.

18:11.675 --> 18:13.551
For instance, when you masturbate…

18:14.886 --> 18:19.349
I bet nine out ten times
when you masturbate, you close your eyes.

18:21.518 --> 18:23.019
I get it.

18:23.103 --> 18:25.772
You're a sicko in the real world
and a pervert in the imaginary one.

18:25.855 --> 18:26.856
Sicko?

18:26.940 --> 18:29.901
Paula, you're in a psychiatric hospital.
I'm not.

18:29.984 --> 18:31.528
- Oh, you're not?
- No.

18:33.071 --> 18:36.116
I'm at my beach in Bahia.

18:41.204 --> 18:43.832
What's going on?

18:49.754 --> 18:51.381
How many doses?

18:51.464 --> 18:53.216
The four you prescribed.

18:53.299 --> 18:54.718
Vital signs?

18:56.428 --> 18:57.762
All normal.

18:58.930 --> 19:00.140
Release him.

19:02.809 --> 19:04.310
Asshole! Damn it!

19:05.854 --> 19:07.522
Long time no see, Consul.

19:08.064 --> 19:09.357
What's going on?

19:12.861 --> 19:14.237
Where am I?

19:14.946 --> 19:16.239
What's happening?

19:16.322 --> 19:21.286
What's happening is that
I should have deleted you from my résumé.

19:23.371 --> 19:27.083
I thought you were just a consul
going through some stress issues.

19:27.959 --> 19:28.960
But…

19:30.920 --> 19:32.630
But what?

19:32.714 --> 19:34.215
Say it, Schultz!

19:40.472 --> 19:42.849
You enjoy eating human flesh.

19:46.811 --> 19:48.271
You're completely crazy.

19:50.357 --> 19:52.067
Do you remember anything?

19:53.151 --> 19:55.362
About what happened in the last few days?

19:56.529 --> 19:57.947
About what you've done?

20:02.243 --> 20:04.329
No. Nothing.

20:06.122 --> 20:07.749
Ah, Almeida.

20:08.458 --> 20:10.835
We've got a lot to talk about.

20:18.301 --> 20:20.970
WELCOME TO WHITE MIST

20:38.780 --> 20:41.574
Talk! Go ahead, you son of a bitch.

21:07.100 --> 21:08.101
Paula.

21:11.312 --> 21:12.397
Please.

21:38.298 --> 21:39.966
- Is she gone?
- Yeah.

21:41.760 --> 21:43.553
What are you doing? Shh!

21:45.597 --> 21:49.059
Getting rid of the pills.
You should do the same.

21:50.685 --> 21:53.188
- There's a better way to do it.

21:55.857 --> 21:58.068
Why don't you take your meds?
What's the matter?

21:58.568 --> 22:01.404
They make everything fuzzy and confusing,

22:01.488 --> 22:03.281
and I'd rather not forget anything.

22:03.365 --> 22:04.949
Especially the secrets.

22:06.534 --> 22:08.078
What are you talking about?

22:09.412 --> 22:13.708
They want us to be confused
so we won't find out the secret, Paula.

22:13.792 --> 22:15.126
What secret?

22:17.837 --> 22:19.005
At night.

22:19.631 --> 22:21.591
All you have to do
is close your eyes and dream.

22:25.720 --> 22:27.055
You know what?

22:27.722 --> 22:30.475
You're even prettier
than you are in my dreams.

22:37.190 --> 22:38.942
- What the fuck is this?
- Calm down!

22:39.025 --> 22:41.653
- Look at where you are!
- You can't be in here! Let me go!

22:41.736 --> 22:43.613
I need to understand
what happened to my daughter!

22:43.697 --> 22:45.281
I don't wanna talk to you!

22:46.324 --> 22:49.536
Give me a minute. That's all I ask, Paula.

22:54.332 --> 22:56.126
I don't wanna talk to you.

22:57.669 --> 22:59.045
I need to know.

22:59.587 --> 23:01.756
It's all I ask of you. Please.

23:03.049 --> 23:04.342
For Lúcia.

23:13.184 --> 23:16.271
If you stick your hand in a blender,

23:16.855 --> 23:19.733
it's not my fault that I own a blender.

23:20.275 --> 23:22.235
Any jury will agree with me.

23:30.535 --> 23:34.497
This clinic is surrounded
by strange stuff.

23:35.874 --> 23:38.460
And I've been smelling shit here
for a long time.

23:39.169 --> 23:41.087
Easy with that imagination of yours.

23:41.838 --> 23:43.631
It can be very misleading.

23:43.715 --> 23:46.760
Are you threatening me, sauerkraut?

23:46.843 --> 23:48.053
Hmm.

23:50.305 --> 23:53.808
Your imagination is much more elaborate
than your humor.

23:54.684 --> 23:57.479
But my truth can impress many people.

23:57.562 --> 24:00.231
I know about things
you can't even imagine.

24:01.024 --> 24:02.609
Concentration camps.

24:08.239 --> 24:10.116
- Ring a bell?
- No.

24:15.080 --> 24:20.001
But I propose a more realistic solution
than your imagination.

24:36.726 --> 24:39.312
We can solve this another way, Schultz.

24:40.814 --> 24:44.234
In front of the cameras. Just you and me.

24:44.984 --> 24:46.403
I want an exclusive interview.

24:47.404 --> 24:49.906
No. I couldn't care less
about your audience.

25:11.344 --> 25:14.931
That just proves I'm on the right track.

25:36.536 --> 25:38.329
WHITE MIST
FORENSIC PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL

25:38.997 --> 25:40.832
These aren't visiting hours.

25:40.915 --> 25:43.001
Last time I made an exception,
I almost lost my job.

25:43.084 --> 25:44.127
You're right.

25:44.210 --> 25:46.504
And Paula lost her daughter
and her parents.

25:46.588 --> 25:49.049
She's committed here,
and I'm the only friend she has.

25:49.883 --> 25:51.134
I can't.

25:54.304 --> 25:55.638
It's not up to me.

25:56.264 --> 25:57.349
Okay.

25:58.016 --> 25:59.559
Give her this box of chocolates, then,

25:59.642 --> 26:02.437
so she at least knows I'm here for her
and that I care about her.

26:14.991 --> 26:16.659
You look healthy.

26:18.411 --> 26:19.496
I feel great.

26:20.413 --> 26:23.083
Now you have a whole world
just for yourself.

26:26.044 --> 26:27.295
Come on.

26:28.338 --> 26:30.215
Where are you now?

26:30.882 --> 26:33.093
What you mean? Where else could I be?

26:35.011 --> 26:36.888
I'm at my beach.

26:42.936 --> 26:46.272
- <i>Describe your beach.</i>

26:46.356 --> 26:48.650
<i>It's a deserted beach,</i>

26:50.151 --> 26:54.155
<i>with sand so white and fine, you know?</i>

26:56.866 --> 26:59.202
- Is it hot in there?
- Always.

27:00.620 --> 27:03.289
Haven't I told you
that I have two suns here?

27:03.373 --> 27:05.542
<i>Why two?</i>

27:05.625 --> 27:06.835
<i>Because I can.</i>

27:11.131 --> 27:13.258
<i>Where are you now?</i>

27:14.092 --> 27:16.052
<i>I'm going into the sea.</i>

27:19.389 --> 27:22.475
<i>The water's lapping at my ankles.</i>

27:24.185 --> 27:27.355
I imagine you'd like the water
to be colder.

27:27.439 --> 27:29.107
I would. It's nicer.

27:36.740 --> 27:38.283
<i>I'm gonna take a dive.</i>

27:42.912 --> 27:45.999
And where are you now?

27:49.085 --> 27:50.962
<i>Under the water.</i>

27:52.130 --> 27:55.633
And how long
can you stay underwater?

27:55.717 --> 27:57.093
As long as I want.

27:58.386 --> 28:01.639
<i>Why would I limit myself</i>
<i>to the rules of your world?</i>

28:08.313 --> 28:10.899
- Wait. Who is this for?

28:10.982 --> 28:13.568
117. For Paula Costa.

28:25.330 --> 28:26.664
I'll take it.

28:44.516 --> 28:48.645
Now try to leave this beach.
Imagine something totally different.

28:50.313 --> 28:52.315
Different? Different how?

28:53.608 --> 28:55.610
Imagine some snow.

29:12.460 --> 29:14.796
- Snow sucks.

29:16.339 --> 29:19.092
Drink something alcoholic. Like vodka.

29:19.175 --> 29:21.344
That's how they survive in the cold.

29:21.428 --> 29:22.971
<i>Vodka.</i>

29:30.353 --> 29:33.064
0.62.

29:33.148 --> 29:35.191
What does that mean?

29:37.193 --> 29:39.237
That you shouldn't be driving.

30:18.818 --> 30:22.197
It's me, Camila.

30:24.115 --> 30:28.370
Take closer look at right eye socket.

30:57.399 --> 30:59.109
We're ready.

31:00.694 --> 31:02.779
The mind is a trap, Lucas.

31:03.905 --> 31:05.240
Don't you ever forget it.

31:06.491 --> 31:07.951
Not in this case.

31:08.535 --> 31:09.786
Then come on.

31:10.370 --> 31:11.913
Focus.

31:24.592 --> 31:26.261
<i>Mom!</i>

31:32.100 --> 31:35.061
<i>Mom, help me! I'm gonna die!</i>

31:43.903 --> 31:44.904
Lucas?

31:59.836 --> 32:02.005
- Wait!

32:28.615 --> 32:30.700
- I told you not to take the pills.

32:30.784 --> 32:32.077
I didn't.

32:32.827 --> 32:35.455
- What's going on?
- I'm here to help you.

32:35.538 --> 32:37.665
- Help me?
- To find.

32:39.501 --> 32:40.752
To find what?

32:42.671 --> 32:43.672
Lucas!

32:52.722 --> 32:54.057
There's a hole in the fence.

32:54.140 --> 32:56.518
We'll go through and walk
till you find what you want.

32:56.601 --> 32:58.436
And why should I trust you?

32:58.520 --> 33:01.439
You don't have any other choice.

33:03.566 --> 33:04.693
What is it?

33:08.530 --> 33:11.199
You're letting your fears get in your way.

33:44.691 --> 33:46.901
Hello?

33:46.985 --> 33:48.486
<i>Today is the day.</i>

33:50.739 --> 33:52.824
You were right again, Paula.
