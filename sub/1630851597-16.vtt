- No.

08:16.762 --> 08:19.319
and Grayson was younger,

08:16.762 --> 08:19.319

08:33.413 --> 08:36.490
it's about playing with her

08:38.118 --> 08:40.529

08:41.653 --> 08:43.559
to do that,

11:50.110 --> 11:52.245
- Chloe is feeling left out

11:52.278 --> 11:53.645

11:52.278 --> 11:53.645
like y'all

11:53.679 --> 11:55.682

11:53.679 --> 11:55.682

11:55.715 --> 11:58.451

11:58.485 --> 12:01.520

12:03.423 --> 12:05.424

12:13.659 --> 12:14.801
when Chase and Wandell

12:13.659 --> 12:14.801
took you to the mall,

12:14.833 --> 12:16.702
and you felt left out,

12:14.833 --> 12:16.702

12:16.735 --> 12:18.171

12:18.203 --> 12:21.140
<i>not even talking to me.</i>

12:21.173 --> 12:23.942

12:21.173 --> 12:23.942

12:28.248 --> 12:29.783
I don't want to be

12:28.248 --> 12:29.783
that kind of big brother

12:29.816 --> 12:31.418
because y'all always

12:29.816 --> 12:31.418
left me out,

12:31.451 --> 12:32.418
and I don't want

12:31.451 --> 12:32.418
to do that to her.

12:32.451 --> 12:33.519
- Are you for real?

12:33.552 --> 12:36.322
I'm pretty sure,

12:33.552 --> 12:36.322
at like 3 or 4 years old,

12:36.355 --> 12:38.591

12:36.355 --> 12:38.591
with me watching every episode

12:38.625 --> 12:40.493

12:38.625 --> 12:40.493
so you were not left out.

12:40.527 --> 12:42.629

12:40.527 --> 12:42.629
been watching it yourself,

12:42.662 --> 12:43.730
let alone him.

12:43.763 --> 12:45.298
end up together?

12:45.331 --> 12:46.399
- You know what, Gray?

12:46.432 --> 12:47.767
They actually

12:46.432 --> 12:47.767
did end up together.

12:47.801 --> 12:50.235
- They were good together.

12:47.801 --> 12:50.235

12:50.269 --> 12:52.438
but he just needed to be saved,

12:52.471 --> 12:55.174

tired of saving a ho,

13:56.101 --> 13:57.470

13:57.504 --> 14:00.407
all the way up to 13,

13:57.504 --> 14:00.407
14 foot, maybe 15 foot.

14:00.440 --> 14:02.274
the average size up here

14:02.307 --> 14:04.177
where we ride

14:02.307 --> 14:04.177
is anywhere from, like, 8, 10.

14:04.210 --> 14:05.711
- An 8 to 10 foot

14:04.210 --> 14:05.711

- Mm-hmm.

- Easily.

An alligator has over

14:07.179 --> 14:10.884
3,000 pounds of crushing force.

14:20.293 --> 14:22.595
landed in the boat with you?

14:20.293 --> 14:22.595
- Yes, sir. They had one land

of the boat one time.

14:24.364 --> 14:25.565

14:24.364 --> 14:25.565
about, like,

14:25.597 --> 14:27.669
snakes or anything like that?

14:27.669 --> 14:28.768
- We're getting back to those

14:27.669 --> 14:28.768

14:28.802 --> 14:30.269
and just be watching

14:33.605 --> 14:35.475

80 razor-sharp teeth

15:04.604 --> 15:05.804

15:05.839 --> 15:07.106

15:07.139 --> 15:09.419

15:16.950 --> 15:19.519

17:20.874 --> 17:22.842
some minnows.

17:22.875 --> 17:25.450
- There ain't no "minners"

17:22.875 --> 17:25.450
in this damn ocean.

17:25.612 --> 17:26.846
"Minners" don't grow

17:25.612 --> 17:26.846
in the ocean.

17:26.880 --> 17:28.647
- Well, it's not "minners."

17:26.880 --> 17:28.647
It's minnows.

17:28.682 --> 17:31.851
- Well, minnows, pimento

17:28.682 --> 17:31.851
or whatever you call it,

17:31.884 --> 17:33.353
they don't grow in the ocean.

17:33.385 --> 17:36.890
- Okay, Momma.

17:33.385 --> 17:36.890
Well, we're looking for crabs.

17:36.122 --> 17:37.523
- Right there one is!

17:36.122 --> 17:37.523
- There one is.

17:37.557 --> 17:41.326
- See one right there?

17:37.557 --> 17:41.326
You know I am so happy out here

17:41.361 --> 17:44.640
catching crabs

17:41.361 --> 17:44.640
for the seafood broil.

17:44.640 --> 17:46.298
- Well, I would prefer to buy

17:44.640 --> 17:46.298
our food at the supermarket,

17:46.332 --> 17:49.690
but if this will stop you from

17:46.332 --> 17:49.690
going out into the wilderness

17:49.102 --> 17:52.939
and trying to harm yourself

17:49.102 --> 17:52.939
or an alligator in the process,

17:52.971 --> 17:55.750
then I'll endure it.

17:55.750 --> 17:56.675
My mother has decided

17:56.710 --> 17:59.412
that she wants to catch

17:56.710 --> 17:59.412
some local cuisine,

17:59.445 --> 18:02.615
so I've set it up

17:59.445 --> 18:02.615
to where she can go crabbing.

18:02.648 --> 18:05.352
- Yeah, and this is honestly

18:02.648 --> 18:05.352
a lot safer.

18:05.384 --> 18:07.200
We got a nice view.

18:07.529 --> 18:10.155
- Exactly.

18:07.529 --> 18:10.155
- Nothing is going to kill us.

18:10.190 --> 18:13.589
- Well, déjà...

18:13.930 --> 18:14.193
Ew, get the--

18:14.227 --> 18:15.561
What the hell is that?

18:15.595 --> 18:17.529
- That's something we're going

18:15.595 --> 18:17.529
to catch the crabs with.

18:17.564 --> 18:19.665
- It's bait.

18:17.564 --> 18:19.665
- No, I'm not touching that.

18:19.699 --> 18:22.167
- What bait would you like?

18:19.699 --> 18:22.167
Do you want fish?

18:22.201 --> 18:24.671
- Ew, get away. No!

18:24.703 --> 18:26.772
- Okay, the liver?

18:26.806 --> 18:29.642
- Chase, you grab

18:26.806 --> 18:29.642
some good bait for us.

18:29.675 --> 18:31.644
- Here you go.

18:29.675 --> 18:31.644
- God, almighty.

18:31.678 --> 18:33.779
That smells like rank ass.

18:33.813 --> 18:35.414
- Hush, Todd, hush.

18:35.448 --> 18:37.450
- It's bait. Pull yours up.

18:38.585 --> 18:40.252
- Oh, yeah.

18:38.585 --> 18:40.252
They like something stinky.

18:40.286 --> 18:41.421
- That's enough.

18:40.286 --> 18:41.421
I don't need no more.

18:41.453 --> 18:43.559
- Quit being so soft.

Look at that.

19:06.119 --> 19:08.181
- Good job.

19:08.213 --> 19:09.582
- Atta girl.

19:09.615 --> 19:11.518
my grandfather

19:11.550 --> 19:15.855
would be so proud of me

19:11.550 --> 19:15.855
for catching fresh crab.

19:15.888 --> 19:17.656
Now, how much better

19:15.888 --> 19:17.656
does it get than that?

19:17.691 --> 19:19.858
- Nanny, this is

19:17.691 --> 19:19.858
about as good as it gets.

19:20.794 --> 19:23.289
- Oh, get my hat.

19:20.794 --> 19:23.289
Go down there and get it.

19:23.630 --> 19:24.698
Todd?

19:23.630 --> 19:24.698
- No, I love you,

19:24.730 --> 19:26.660
but I have limits.

19:26.990 --> 19:28.101
- Hang on, Nanny.

19:26.990 --> 19:28.101
I'll get it for you. Hang on.

19:28.134 --> 19:29.336
- Damn, my hat.

19:29.368 --> 19:31.304

I mean, we have made

20:36.336 --> 20:38.904
so many memories down here.

20:38.938 --> 20:42.799
So I want to know what's your

20:38.938 --> 20:42.799
favorite memory from this trip?

20:42.420 --> 20:46.145
- I would say parasailing

20:42.420 --> 20:46.145
or the water park with Chloe.

20:46.179 --> 20:47.780
- I'm going to have to say

20:46.179 --> 20:47.780
taking Dad out

20:47.814 --> 20:49.548
on that gator boat

20:47.814 --> 20:49.548
and scaring him.

20:49.582 --> 20:50.784
[laughs]

20:50.817 --> 20:52.519
- Really?

20:50.817 --> 20:52.519
- Mine was definitely

20:52.849 --> 20:53.886
the water park with Chloe.

20:53.920 --> 20:55.922
- And mine

20:53.920 --> 20:55.922
is catching the crabs.

20:55.954 --> 20:58.625
- I'm glad we caught crab

20:55.954 --> 20:58.625
and not gator.

20:58.657 --> 21:01.894
- I think my favorite time was

20:58.657 --> 21:01.894
spending time with my family,

21:01.928 --> 21:03.960
and I want you all to know

that I love you

21:03.128 --> 21:05.650

21:05.650 --> 21:07.666
- You know, I think when you

21:05.650 --> 21:07.666
have a family as big as ours,

21:07.701 --> 21:10.502
everyone's not going to agree

21:07.701 --> 21:10.502
on all the activities,

21:10.537 --> 21:13.306
<i>but the main thing is is that</i>

21:10.537 --> 21:13.306
<i>we were able to come together</i>

21:13.339 --> 21:14.874
<i>and spend quality time.</i>

21:14.907 --> 21:17.769
- I mean, could I have used

21:14.907 --> 21:17.769
a little bit more relaxation?

21:17.109 --> 21:19.412
Absolutely, but that's

21:17.109 --> 21:19.412
just not how we roll.

- So true, but you know what?

A girl can always dream.
