00:01.501 --> 00:04.838
MOLLY: <i> I went to space</i>
<i>on a 13-month solo mission.</i>

00:04.921 --> 00:06.756
<i>I didn't come home alone.</i>

00:06.840 --> 00:09.968
<i>The child--</i>
<i>part human, part alien--</i>

00:10.051 --> 00:13.096
<i>was unlike anything</i>
<i>the world had ever seen.</i>

00:13.179 --> 00:16.433
{\an5}<i>My other child</i>
<i>is a lifelike android.</i>
Mom?

00:16.516 --> 00:17.934
<i>He has become the prototype</i>
<i>for a new breed</i>

00:18.017 --> 00:21.354
<i>of thinking machines</i>
<i>called Humanichs.</i>

00:21.438 --> 00:23.648
<i>These two extraordinary</i>
<i>new life-forms</i>

00:23.732 --> 00:26.234
<i>now hold the key</i>
<i>to Earth's future.</i>

00:26.317 --> 00:29.112
<i>But where does that leave us?</i>

00:29.195 --> 00:31.906
<i>Over 99% of all species</i>

00:31.990 --> 00:34.409
<i>that have ever existed</i>
<i>have gone extinct.</i>

00:34.492 --> 00:36.494
<i>What if it's our time?</i>

00:39.831 --> 00:41.624
<i>Previously on</i> Extant...

00:41.708 --> 00:43.752
{\an5}What are you
proposing?
Coexistence.

00:43.835 --> 00:46.629
{\an1}Coexistence means the end
of the human race.

00:46.713 --> 00:49.424
{\an5}RICHTER:
<i>You need to figure out which</i>
<i>world you want to live in.</i>

00:49.507 --> 00:50.842
You can't have both.

00:50.925 --> 00:52.969
Kelsey Richter, daughter
of suspected terrorist,

00:53.052 --> 00:55.972
JD Richter, was taken
into custody today...

00:56.055 --> 00:57.307
What the hell?

00:57.390 --> 00:58.308
{\an1}You're not going
anywhere.

00:58.391 --> 01:00.435
{\an3}JD, don't.
Ares, stop it!

01:01.519 --> 01:04.147
He's free to go.

01:04.230 --> 01:06.149
{\an3}In another life,
Molly Woods.

01:06.232 --> 01:08.276
Yeah.

LUCY:

01:09.486 --> 01:11.446
CHARLIE:
<i>Julie's.</i>

01:11.529 --> 01:12.655
Was that her boyfriend?

01:12.739 --> 01:14.365
{\an1}Oh, my God,
I could go to jail.

01:14.449 --> 01:17.327
Only if someone tells.

01:18.703 --> 01:19.662
Wait, wait.

01:19.746 --> 01:21.331
This just can't happen.

01:21.414 --> 01:24.042
MOLLY: <i> The GSC has a virus</i>
<i>to kill hybrids.</i>

01:24.125 --> 01:25.877
A virus I created.

01:25.960 --> 01:27.295
Hello, Taylor.

01:27.378 --> 01:28.671
What's your recommendation?

01:28.755 --> 01:30.673
TAALR:
Release the virus in conjunction

01:30.757 --> 01:32.467
<i>with the deployment</i>

01:39.390 --> 01:40.475

02:25.937 --> 02:27.856
You're not eating.

02:27.939 --> 02:30.400
I'm not hungry.

02:30.483 --> 02:32.902
You wish he hadn't left.

02:35.947 --> 02:37.407
You shouldn't do that, Terra.

02:37.490 --> 02:38.825
You can look into my mind
if you want.

02:38.908 --> 02:40.368
{\an3}No.

02:40.451 --> 02:42.745
I can't read minds
like you can.

02:42.829 --> 02:44.497
But you can learn.

02:45.832 --> 02:47.292
I don't want to.

02:47.375 --> 02:51.421
People's thoughts and feelings

02:51.504 --> 02:53.840
I don't want you to be sad.

02:55.341 --> 02:58.761
Well, being sad

Molly, they're landing.

03:33.838 --> 03:35.340
Down to the tunnels!

03:35.423 --> 03:37.508
We have to evacuate now!

03:37.592 --> 03:38.801
Everybody, stop!

03:40.053 --> 03:41.304
{\an3}We don't

03:41.387 --> 03:42.972
We don't need
to fight.

03:43.056 --> 03:43.932
We'll win.

03:45.433 --> 03:46.935
They're inferior.

03:47.018 --> 03:49.020
Our powers have proven that.

03:58.446 --> 04:01.157
Stop thinking like a human.

04:12.085 --> 04:13.962
{\an5}This is a mistake.
AHDU: Violence is not
our choice,

to survive, we will.

04:32.939 --> 04:34.524

{\an1}Sorry, but that hurt

08:39.519 --> 08:43.105
The good news is we don't have
to cauterize this.

08:43.188 --> 08:46.359
{\an5}What's the bad news?
The bad news is it's still
gonna hurt like hell,

08:46.442 --> 08:48.444
{\an3}but it'll stop the bleeding
and prevent infection.

08:48.527 --> 08:49.737

08:49.820 --> 08:52.281
Sorry.

AHDU: You didn't
have to do that.

08:54.242 --> 08:55.451
{\an3}Her body will take
care of itself.

08:55.534 --> 08:57.161
Yeah, I've seen that,

08:57.245 --> 08:59.247

the flower-power mentality,

08:59.330 --> 09:01.123

09:01.207 --> 09:03.334
{\an1}What'd you find out,
Ahdu?

09:03.417 --> 09:05.294
{\an3}Casualties.

09:05.378 --> 09:08.631
Women, children.

09:10.216 --> 09:12.218
Some got away.

09:13.302 --> 09:14.762
Some didn't.

09:14.845 --> 09:16.347
Did they find Terra?

09:18.391 --> 09:19.850
Or Ares.

09:19.934 --> 09:22.228
{\an3}But I know they're
out there somewhere.

09:22.311 --> 09:24.355
How do you know that?

09:24.438 --> 09:26.315
I just do.

09:26.399 --> 09:28.651
RICHTER: You know, they

09:28.734 --> 09:31.153
I don't get it.

{\an3}(coughs)

09:37.535 --> 09:39.996
Oh.

The canisters.

09:43.708 --> 09:45.501
They released the virus.

09:51.090 --> 09:53.092
They did finish the job.

{\an5}Come on, everybody
out of the way.
Move!

10:01.726 --> 10:03.394
{\an3}Her spinal cortex
has been destroyed.

10:03.477 --> 10:06.147
{\an1}Lumbar vertebrae have
suffered catastrophic damages.

10:06.230 --> 10:07.356
Two, three.

10:07.440 --> 10:09.859
Lucy, can you hear me?
I can hear you.

10:09.942 --> 10:11.193
All right,
vocals have been affected.

10:11.277 --> 10:12.987
That means her motor skills
will be, too.

10:13.070 --> 10:14.488
Okay, don't worry.

10:14.572 --> 10:16.824
We're gonna get you back
on your feet in no time, okay?

10:16.907 --> 10:18.326
Charlie, this is horrible.

10:18.409 --> 10:20.077
{\an1}It's all right,
she's not in any pain.

10:20.161 --> 10:21.370
{\an1}That's the beauty
of Humanichs.

10:21.454 --> 10:22.371
{\an1}What's done can
be undone.

10:22.455 --> 10:23.873
I'm not talking
about repairs.

10:23.956 --> 10:25.416
I'm talking about
what I've done...

10:25.499 --> 10:27.585
{\an3}with John's vision
of the program.

10:27.668 --> 10:30.171
That can't be undone.

10:33.299 --> 10:34.216
ETHAN:
Lucy!

10:34.300 --> 10:36.344
You're back!

10:37.345 --> 10:39.430
What happened?

10:39.513 --> 10:41.223
Who did this to you?!

10:42.767 --> 10:44.727
Molly Woods.

10:44.810 --> 10:47.229
Your mother.

10:52.610 --> 10:55.571
They took John's life's work

10:55.654 --> 10:59.367
and turned them into assassins.

10:59.450 --> 11:01.452
(Ahdu coughing)

11:02.995 --> 11:04.914
(coughing)

11:04.997 --> 11:07.124
{\an3}Is this what's going
to happen to you?

11:08.668 --> 11:10.419
I don't know.

11:10.503 --> 11:14.673
Everybody is affected
differently by the virus.

11:16.008 --> 11:17.426
Does that meant that

11:17.510 --> 11:20.388
{\an3}there's a chance
you won't get sick?

11:20.471 --> 11:22.723
I don't know.

11:22.807 --> 11:25.434
I can't... control
what's gonna happen to me.

11:27.061 --> 11:28.938
{\an1}(coughing)
Right now,

11:29.021 --> 11:30.981
all I care about

11:31.065 --> 11:33.818
is taking care of my son.

11:44.703 --> 11:46.956
{\an1}(grunting)
Oh, okay.

11:47.039 --> 11:48.457
Come on, come on.

11:48.541 --> 11:51.627
Oh, crap.

11:51.710 --> 11:54.088
Who is it?
It's my ex-wife.

11:54.171 --> 11:55.798
Here, can you get
Ahdu in the house?

12:02.930 --> 12:06.809
{\an3}I... I can see how
this looks bad.

12:06.892 --> 12:08.477
Bad?!

12:08.561 --> 12:10.146
{\an1}Uh, my ex-husband's
a terrorist?!

12:10.229 --> 12:11.856
{\an1}The GSC literally
just dragged our daughter

12:11.939 --> 12:13.482
out of my living room.

12:13.566 --> 12:15.484
{\an5}They won't even
let me talk to her.
It's just

12:15.568 --> 12:17.319
a scare tactic, all right?
They're not gonna hurt her.

12:17.403 --> 12:20.614
What the hell have you
gotten yourself into?

12:22.450 --> 12:23.659
It's complicated.

12:23.742 --> 12:24.869
Okay.

12:24.952 --> 12:26.162
{\an3}Uh, look.

12:26.245 --> 12:27.496
How did you even
get here anyway?

12:27.580 --> 12:28.497
Where's you car?
I parked

12:28.581 --> 12:30.666
and I walked up the back trail,
the old trail.

12:30.750 --> 12:32.501
So, no one followed you?
No, no.

12:32.585 --> 12:34.128
I followed all your crazy-ass

12:34.211 --> 12:35.337
security protocol.

12:35.421 --> 12:37.339
{\an1}And, yes, I remember
what you told me

12:37.423 --> 12:40.301
about how to spot a tail.

12:40.384 --> 12:42.178
Thank you.
Don't thank me.

12:42.261 --> 12:43.554
You're a wanted man.

12:43.637 --> 12:45.514
My just being here
makes me an accessory.

12:45.598 --> 12:46.974
And I'm a judge.
At the very least,

12:47.057 --> 12:48.809
I could lose my seat
on the bench.

12:48.893 --> 12:51.353
{\an1}Please.

12:51.437 --> 12:55.024
{\an1}Please, JD, tell me what
the hell is going on here.

12:55.107 --> 12:56.400
I mean, honey,
you're a lot of things,

12:56.484 --> 12:58.986
but a terrorist
is not one of them.

13:02.490 --> 13:05.409
{\an3}It's not me that
they're looking for.

13:05.493 --> 13:07.870
{\an3}Okay?
Ah.

13:07.953 --> 13:09.872
{\an1}So you say it's
very complicated,

13:09.955 --> 13:11.373
{\an1}but actually
it's quite simple.

13:11.457 --> 13:13.000
No.
You turn them in,

13:13.083 --> 13:14.502
and we get our girl back.

13:14.585 --> 13:15.836
No, Dorothy.
Look,

13:15.920 --> 13:17.379
if you're not gonna do it,
I will.

13:17.463 --> 13:18.506
{\an3}Dorothy?

13:18.589 --> 13:20.424
Oh, wow.

13:20.508 --> 13:21.884
Your heart's racing.

13:21.967 --> 13:23.761
What's happening to me?
The virus

13:23.844 --> 13:26.889
is... affecting your blood.

13:26.972 --> 13:28.891
How long do I have?

13:28.974 --> 13:31.894
{\an3}Well, at the rate
your cells reproduce...

13:31.977 --> 13:33.395
A day.

13:33.479 --> 13:35.022
Maybe two.

13:35.105 --> 13:36.565
DOROTHY:
Listen!

13:36.649 --> 13:39.777
Whatever's going on here...

13:41.695 --> 13:43.989
What the hell? Uh...

13:45.449 --> 13:46.909
{\an1}JD:
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

13:46.992 --> 13:47.910
{\an3}Dorothy!

13:47.993 --> 13:49.370
Put the gun down, Dorothy.

13:49.453 --> 13:51.539
Did you not see
what just happened?

13:51.622 --> 13:53.541
Okay, I-I can explain...
No, no, no. I don't I want you

13:53.624 --> 13:55.751
to explain anything;
I want you and-and whatever

13:55.834 --> 13:57.419
that is to get
out of this house.

13:57.503 --> 13:58.796
Now!

13:58.879 --> 14:00.422
Listen to me, Dorothy.
You're not...

14:00.506 --> 14:01.799
you're not thinking straight,
all right?

14:01.882 --> 14:02.925
Just...

14:03.008 --> 14:06.220
{\an1}Dorothy?

14:07.680 --> 14:09.223
Molly, what the hell?

14:09.306 --> 14:10.975
Knock it off!

14:11.058 --> 14:12.726
(laughs)
Thanks.

14:12.810 --> 14:14.436
That means a lot.

14:14.520 --> 14:17.273
(laughs)
I love you, too.

14:18.691 --> 14:19.608
All right.

14:19.692 --> 14:21.610
You know what?
That's enough.

14:21.694 --> 14:24.071
{\an3}Stop it!

14:28.284 --> 14:31.495
{\an3}I know

14:31.579 --> 14:33.497
{\an3}that it's hard for you to
understand what's happening.

14:33.581 --> 14:35.583
What...?

14:35.666 --> 14:37.668
What the hell?

14:39.670 --> 14:40.796
ETHAN:
Can she be fixed?

14:40.879 --> 14:42.256
JULIE:
We're trying.

14:42.339 --> 14:44.091
{\an3}Lucy's in good hands
with Charlie.

14:44.174 --> 14:46.635
No, she doesn't want
a human working on her!

14:46.719 --> 14:48.137
Why not?

14:48.220 --> 14:49.680
Because they can't be trusted.

14:51.015 --> 14:53.601
Why would you say that?

14:53.684 --> 14:56.145
{\an1}(sighs)
Lucy said that...

14:56.228 --> 14:58.981
she said it was Molly
who hurt her.

15:00.399 --> 15:03.485
Ethan, Lucy has suffered

15:03.569 --> 15:05.487
quite a bit of damage.

15:05.571 --> 15:06.822
{\an3}Her diagnostics
show misfires

15:06.905 --> 15:08.699
{\an3}all through her
cognitive processors.

15:08.782 --> 15:10.868
You can't be sure she's
got all her facts right.

15:10.951 --> 15:12.661
Humanichs aren't supposed
to hurt humans,

15:12.745 --> 15:14.872
but humans can hurt Humanichs.

15:14.955 --> 15:16.999
Why is that okay?

15:17.082 --> 15:18.500
It's not okay.

15:18.584 --> 15:20.711
Nobody wants to hurt anybody.

15:20.794 --> 15:22.296
So you would never hurt me?

15:22.379 --> 15:23.672
Never.

15:23.756 --> 15:26.175
What about Lucy?

15:26.258 --> 15:29.637
Not intentionally, no.

15:29.720 --> 15:31.347
Good.

15:31.430 --> 15:34.433
{\an1}'Cause if you did,
I don't know what I'd do.

15:45.444 --> 15:46.487
Hey.

15:46.570 --> 15:48.697
I brought you a little something
to take the edge off,

15:48.781 --> 15:51.200
{\an1}maybe help you calm down.
Calm down?

15:51.283 --> 15:54.495
After what just happened
and... what she did and...?

15:54.578 --> 15:56.664
And then there's
that... I mean,

15:56.747 --> 15:58.707
I-I don't even know what he is.
What is he?!

15:58.791 --> 16:01.126
{\an1}All right, now,
come here.

16:03.128 --> 16:04.672
{\an1}(sighs)

16:04.755 --> 16:07.549
{\an1}He is...

16:07.633 --> 16:09.218
half human.

16:09.301 --> 16:11.637
{\an1}A hybrid--

16:11.720 --> 16:13.430
human-alien.

16:22.564 --> 16:24.775
Okay.

16:24.858 --> 16:26.902
His name is Ahdu.

16:26.985 --> 16:29.822
He is Molly's son.

16:29.905 --> 16:32.074
And he's dying.

16:32.157 --> 16:33.450
Well, I'm sorry.

16:33.534 --> 16:35.244
I'm sorry for her and him,

16:35.327 --> 16:38.455
um, but, you know,
we have a daughter

16:38.539 --> 16:39.748
who's being held
against her will.

16:39.832 --> 16:42.751
I was on my way
to help Kelsey

16:42.835 --> 16:44.753
when the GSC unleashed
a reign of holy terror

16:44.837 --> 16:47.923
on Molly, Ahdu and his people.

16:48.006 --> 16:50.634
His people?
Whatever you want to call them.

16:50.718 --> 16:52.761
{\an1}There's more of them?
There were.

16:52.845 --> 16:54.388
There were.
Most were slaughtered.

16:54.471 --> 16:55.639
I saw what was going on,

16:55.723 --> 16:57.891
{\an1}and I couldn't stand by
and let that happen.

16:57.975 --> 16:58.976
{\an3}Not again.
This isn't Second Kuwait.

16:59.059 --> 17:01.812
I mean...

17:01.895 --> 17:03.939
you're talking about--
I-I can't even believe

17:04.021 --> 17:06.316
I'm saying this--
you're talking about aliens!

17:06.400 --> 17:09.611
I mean, I mean, if turning
them in gets us Kelsey back,

17:09.694 --> 17:11.864
then just do it, JD.

17:13.115 --> 17:14.825
I can't.

17:14.907 --> 17:16.410
I-I can't turn them in.

17:16.492 --> 17:18.579
If I do that,
they will be killed.

17:18.662 --> 17:20.622
(sighs)

17:20.705 --> 17:22.624
Listen to me.

17:22.708 --> 17:24.460
I-I think I have
another solution.

17:29.673 --> 17:31.884
Okay.

17:37.639 --> 17:38.807
It's cold.

17:38.891 --> 17:39.975
{\an3}I know.

17:40.058 --> 17:42.811
If we can lower
your body temperature,

17:42.895 --> 17:45.814
we just be able to slow down
the progression of the virus.

17:45.898 --> 17:47.316
And then what?

17:47.399 --> 17:49.359
(sighs)

17:51.570 --> 17:53.322
It's all right, Molly.

17:53.405 --> 17:55.157
No, it's not all right.

17:55.240 --> 17:58.535
I am not giving up, Ahdu, okay?

17:58.619 --> 18:01.413
I am gonna figure this out.

18:01.497 --> 18:04.792
Now, there's one person I know

18:04.875 --> 18:06.794
that just may be
able to help you.

18:09.129 --> 18:10.464
{\an6}DOROTHY:
Why are you doing this?
Don't do this!

18:10.547 --> 18:11.632
{\an3}We both know
there's another way.

18:11.715 --> 18:12.883
{\an1}No, there's not
another way.

18:12.966 --> 18:14.218
{\an1}I'm going.

18:14.301 --> 18:15.344
Going where?

18:15.427 --> 18:17.638
To get Kelsey.

18:17.721 --> 18:19.681
I'm gonna turn myself in, Molly.

18:19.765 --> 18:21.975
{\an3}Yeah, he's sacrificing himself
for you and your son.

18:22.059 --> 18:23.977
{\an1}I mean, that's who they
really want, right?

18:24.061 --> 18:25.145
She's right.

18:25.229 --> 18:26.146
You can't do that.

18:26.230 --> 18:27.356
They don't want you.

18:27.439 --> 18:28.649
If I turn myself in,

18:28.732 --> 18:30.359
the GSC, they'll
release Kelsey.

18:30.442 --> 18:31.652
All right? So, Dot,

18:31.735 --> 18:33.362
you get me a good lawyer.

18:33.445 --> 18:36.073
{\an3}Look, I'm gonna
keep the GSC busy.

18:36.156 --> 18:38.367
{\an3}It'll buy you time,
get them off your scent.

18:38.450 --> 18:40.369
I'm not gonna sit here
and watch him die.

18:40.452 --> 18:42.037
What choice do you have?

18:42.120 --> 18:44.540
There's someone at the GSC
that I think can help Ahdu.

18:44.623 --> 18:46.208
Now, I know it's a Hail Mary,

18:46.291 --> 18:48.043
but I at least have got to try.
No.

18:48.126 --> 18:51.255
You get within 20 miles of GSC,
they're gonna tag you.

18:51.338 --> 18:52.840
Well, that's a risk
I'm gonna have to take.

18:52.923 --> 18:54.550
And what about Ahdu?

18:55.843 --> 18:57.553
Well, he needs
his cold packs changed

18:57.636 --> 19:00.556
every half hour to keep his body
temperature from rising.

19:02.516 --> 19:05.018
No!

19:05.102 --> 19:06.436
{\an3}No, I'm not going
back in there.

19:06.520 --> 19:08.105
I don't know what
that alien's capable of!

19:08.188 --> 19:09.606
That alien...

19:09.690 --> 19:12.442
is my son and he's dying.

19:12.526 --> 19:14.736
I promise you

19:14.820 --> 19:17.155
I will take care
of our daughter.

19:22.494 --> 19:25.080
Okay.

19:25.163 --> 19:27.666
Thank you.

19:34.173 --> 19:37.467
{\an1}Dorothy,
don't do anything stupid.

19:37.551 --> 19:40.596
{\an1}Please.

19:43.015 --> 19:46.184
(sighs)

19:47.686 --> 19:49.938
(car engine starts)

20:02.201 --> 20:04.661
I... feel...

20:04.745 --> 20:06.288
Pain?

20:06.371 --> 20:09.625
...fear.

20:09.708 --> 20:12.252
Now I get why humans fear death.

20:12.336 --> 20:14.004
(sighs)

20:14.087 --> 20:15.130
I don't want to die, Charlie.

20:15.213 --> 20:16.298
{\an1}Hey.

20:16.381 --> 20:17.591
Luckily, you're not going to.

20:17.674 --> 20:19.301
At least, not today.

20:19.384 --> 20:22.471
No, not now. Ever.

20:22.554 --> 20:23.805
{\an1}I can't remove
your expiration date, Lucy.

20:23.889 --> 20:25.474
You mean you won't.

20:25.557 --> 20:27.142
No.

20:27.225 --> 20:29.144
I mean, I physically can't.

20:29.227 --> 20:31.980
{\an1}Removing your expiration date
would kill you.

20:32.064 --> 20:33.148
It's a safeguard.

20:33.231 --> 20:34.691
Safeguard from what?

20:34.775 --> 20:37.611
John Woods believed that nothing
was meant to last forever.

20:37.694 --> 20:39.321
Not even a soldier.

20:39.404 --> 20:41.531
{\an1}Expiration dates give you more
of the human experience.

20:41.615 --> 20:44.618
I am not human.

20:46.536 --> 20:48.705
I want to live.

20:48.789 --> 20:52.000
Whatever the cost.

20:54.044 --> 20:56.672
Find a way to remove
my expiration date

20:56.755 --> 20:58.840
or I tell Julie everything.

21:00.884 --> 21:03.804
How you didn't install
my limiters.

21:03.887 --> 21:07.015
And how we had... relations.

21:07.099 --> 21:08.558
{\an1}Wh...

21:10.477 --> 21:11.478
What are you doing?

21:11.561 --> 21:13.355
{\an1}What are you doing?
Stop it.

21:13.438 --> 21:14.648
Stop that.

21:14.731 --> 21:17.734
Stop it! Stop it!

21:21.321 --> 21:23.073
How the hell
did you get video of that?

21:23.156 --> 21:24.700
That was a mistake.

21:24.783 --> 21:25.742
Which I stopped.

21:25.826 --> 21:27.577
I know that.

21:27.661 --> 21:28.745
But Julie doesn't.

21:30.163 --> 21:33.375
And neither does the GSC.

21:33.458 --> 21:36.128
All of that can change
with the blink of my eye.

21:52.644 --> 21:53.562
Molly.

21:53.645 --> 21:54.771
Look under the table.

21:59.526 --> 22:01.153
If this is about
what's happening to you,

22:01.236 --> 22:02.404
there's no way to reverse it.

22:02.487 --> 22:03.530
So you know?

22:03.613 --> 22:05.323
{\an3}We put the pieces together.
Okay,

22:05.407 --> 22:06.783
{\an3}then you know I don't
have a lot of time.

22:06.867 --> 22:09.870
Now, Shepherd released
that virus that we created.

22:09.953 --> 22:12.039
A lot of the hybrids
have been exposed.

22:12.122 --> 22:13.707
Are you...?

22:13.790 --> 22:15.167
Showing symptoms? No.

22:15.250 --> 22:16.752
The others
haven't been so lucky.

22:16.835 --> 22:18.086
I'm sorry.

22:18.170 --> 22:19.421
I don't need sympathy,

22:19.504 --> 22:20.714
I need help.

22:20.797 --> 22:23.133
Now, my son Ahdu is dying.

22:23.216 --> 22:25.260
Do you think
plasmapheresis can save him?

22:25.343 --> 22:27.596
It's a long shot.

22:27.679 --> 22:29.931
Okay, but if I could
take the infected plasma

22:30.015 --> 22:31.099
{\an5}from his blood...
You'd need
special equipment.

22:31.183 --> 22:32.517
And you can get that.

22:32.601 --> 22:36.480
You're asking me
to steal GSC equipment,

22:36.563 --> 22:38.607
{\an1}aid and abet a known fugitive
and enemy of the state.

22:38.690 --> 22:39.816
{\an4}You understand
that, right?
Yes.

22:39.900 --> 22:41.151
And you only helped me

22:41.234 --> 22:42.778
because you had no choice.

22:42.861 --> 22:44.237
Because a scary alien hybrid

22:44.321 --> 22:46.281
took control of your mind.

22:46.365 --> 22:47.949
So that's your story?

22:48.033 --> 22:49.284
{\an3}No.

22:49.367 --> 22:50.827
That's yours.

22:50.911 --> 22:53.121
{\an3}I'm sorry,

22:53.205 --> 22:56.083
but I'm fresh out of options.

22:58.043 --> 23:00.087
(Ahdu's labored breathing)

23:15.394 --> 23:17.020
(labored breathing continues)

23:24.194 --> 23:25.320
Could I have some water?

23:27.239 --> 23:30.033
Uh... sure.

23:48.135 --> 23:51.012
I didn't mean to frighten you.

23:51.096 --> 23:52.347
{\an1}Earlier.

23:52.430 --> 23:54.015
I was just, um...

23:54.099 --> 23:55.600
caught off guard.

23:55.684 --> 23:58.770
It was a logical reaction.

24:06.111 --> 24:09.197
Grabbing the gun wasn't.

24:09.281 --> 24:10.657
You've only held a gun

24:10.740 --> 24:11.867
one other time.

24:11.950 --> 24:14.202
At a range with JD.

24:14.286 --> 24:15.453
How did you...?

24:17.122 --> 24:20.041
(sighs)

24:20.125 --> 24:21.877
He taught me how to use one.

24:21.960 --> 24:22.711
For protection.

24:22.794 --> 24:26.006
He cares deeply for you
and Kelsey.

24:27.007 --> 24:28.383
Did you see that in his mind?

24:28.466 --> 24:31.720
{\an1}I didn't have to look
into his mind

24:31.803 --> 24:34.639
to see the obvious.

24:34.723 --> 24:37.934
But you can see in mine?

24:39.853 --> 24:41.396
He's disappointed you.

24:41.479 --> 24:45.358
{\an1}I know.

24:45.442 --> 24:47.861
He fought for us,

24:47.944 --> 24:50.864
helped us
when he didn't have to.

24:50.947 --> 24:52.449
He's a true hero.

24:52.532 --> 24:54.409
Mm.

24:54.492 --> 24:57.579
Whatever you decide,

24:57.662 --> 24:59.664
I understand.

25:14.054 --> 25:16.598
(elevator engine whirring)

25:31.571 --> 25:34.407
You have my daughter

25:34.491 --> 25:36.451
and now you have me.

25:36.534 --> 25:38.161
Let her go.

25:52.509 --> 25:53.718
CHARLIE:
Wait...

25:57.681 --> 25:59.599
Wait, this is illegal.

25:59.683 --> 26:02.435
It's, like, misuse of government
property or something.

26:02.519 --> 26:04.145
LUCY:
Is that all I am?

26:04.229 --> 26:05.355
Property?

26:05.438 --> 26:08.316
CHARLIE:
No. Of course not. You're...

26:08.400 --> 26:10.443
LUCY:
I want to feel what humans feel.

26:13.446 --> 26:15.657
{\an1}Oh, my God,
I could go to jail.

26:15.740 --> 26:18.285
LUCY:
Only if someone tells.

26:24.249 --> 26:25.458
What the hell, Charlie?

26:25.542 --> 26:27.669
I mean, like, seriously,
what the hell?!

26:27.752 --> 26:30.171
I was drunk, but I didn't sleep
with her, I stopped it.

26:30.255 --> 26:32.173
I mean, that part of the footage

26:32.257 --> 26:33.049
{\an5}is now conveniently missing,
but...
(laughs)

26:33.133 --> 26:35.218
Is that supposed
to make me feel better?

26:35.302 --> 26:36.803
Why are you showing this to me?

26:36.886 --> 26:38.680
Lucy wants me to remove
her expiration date

26:38.763 --> 26:41.141
and if I don't, she's gonna
send that video to the GSC.

26:41.224 --> 26:42.851
She's blackmailing me.

26:42.934 --> 26:45.186
Blackmail? But...

26:45.270 --> 26:48.231
that's way beyond the scope
of her programming.

26:50.775 --> 26:52.027
Actually...

26:52.110 --> 26:53.111
{\an1}it's not.

26:53.194 --> 26:54.529
I never installed her limiters.

26:54.612 --> 26:56.114
What?

26:56.197 --> 26:57.741
{\an3}Why?
She...

26:57.824 --> 26:59.659
Without them, she was... better.

26:59.743 --> 27:00.869
Better at what?

27:00.952 --> 27:02.537
Do you realize what you've done?

27:02.620 --> 27:04.539
Well, you know, if I didn't find
that PyxCube of you and John,

27:04.622 --> 27:05.874
{\an1}we might not even
be having this conversation.

27:05.957 --> 27:07.709
{\an1}You know, I always suspected
with you guys,

27:07.792 --> 27:08.585
but just seeing you like that...
Charlie,

27:08.668 --> 27:10.837
I don't have a PyxCube
of me and John.

27:14.841 --> 27:17.010
She must have planted it.

27:19.679 --> 27:24.184
She knew that would be the
easiest way to manipulate me.

27:24.267 --> 27:25.894
Now she's threatening me.

27:25.977 --> 27:28.271
{\an1}What else
is she capable of?

27:31.149 --> 27:33.902
Ethan said today that
humans aren't to be trusted.

27:33.985 --> 27:36.488
(exhales)

27:36.571 --> 27:39.199
Give you one guess
where he got that from.

27:39.282 --> 27:41.910
Lucy's gone
off the rails, Jules.

27:43.286 --> 27:44.537
{\an1}We need to

27:44.621 --> 27:46.081
shut her down.

27:46.164 --> 27:47.248
For good.

27:58.134 --> 28:00.345
(insects trilling)

28:06.309 --> 28:07.685
What?

28:09.521 --> 28:10.605
Um...

28:22.826 --> 28:25.328
(Ahdu coughing weakly)

28:30.667 --> 28:32.502
Ahdu?

28:32.585 --> 28:34.170
(raspy breathing)

28:34.254 --> 28:35.547
{\an3}MOLLY:
Okay.

28:35.630 --> 28:37.590
I got something here

28:37.674 --> 28:39.592
that might help.

28:40.844 --> 28:42.637
Help.

28:42.720 --> 28:45.014
{\an3}Yeah.

28:46.057 --> 28:47.350
This machine

28:47.434 --> 28:49.727
is gonna take
your infected blood out

28:49.811 --> 28:51.312
clean it,

28:51.396 --> 28:53.231
{\an3}and then put it
back in your body.

28:58.570 --> 29:00.196
Thank you

29:00.280 --> 29:01.489
for staying with him.

29:01.573 --> 29:04.117
(phone ringing)

29:09.164 --> 29:10.331
Hey, baby.

29:10.415 --> 29:11.666
{\an3}Are you
all right?

29:11.749 --> 29:14.294
Oh, thank God.

29:14.377 --> 29:15.503
It's Kelsey.

29:15.587 --> 29:17.505
{\an3}Yeah.

29:17.589 --> 29:19.507
Okay. So you're home?

29:19.591 --> 29:21.593
{\an3}Okay.

29:23.678 --> 29:24.846
Okay...

29:24.929 --> 29:27.223
(whirring)

29:45.450 --> 29:47.869
You got what
you wanted:

29:47.952 --> 29:50.163
the release of
your daughter.

29:52.457 --> 29:54.375
Where is Molly?

29:57.587 --> 29:59.047
You killed her.

30:01.633 --> 30:03.343
She's dead?

30:03.426 --> 30:05.428
What the hell
did you think was gonna happen?

30:05.512 --> 30:08.181
You exposed her to the virus,
General,

30:08.264 --> 30:10.725
so it's just a matter of time.

30:10.808 --> 30:13.603
{\an1}You and I, we both know
what she is now.

30:13.686 --> 30:15.396
So, soon, she's just gonna be

30:15.480 --> 30:17.565
another little notch
on your gun.

30:17.649 --> 30:19.067
Right there next to John Woods.

30:19.150 --> 30:21.736
Careful, Richter.

30:21.819 --> 30:24.364
{\an1}John Woods was my friend.
Yeah,

30:24.447 --> 30:26.533
and we all know
how you treat your friends.

30:26.616 --> 30:29.410
{\an1}Old Tough Call Toby, no way,
he would never order

30:29.494 --> 30:30.912
the death of an innocent man.

30:30.995 --> 30:34.541
I won't be patronized
by a deserter.

30:34.624 --> 30:36.376
A man who would rather

30:36.459 --> 30:39.212
{\an3}go AWOL than
follow an order.

30:39.295 --> 30:40.588
(chuckles dryly)

30:40.672 --> 30:42.423
You don't understand honor.

30:42.507 --> 30:43.883
Honor?

30:43.967 --> 30:46.094
You want to talk about honor?

30:46.177 --> 30:48.263
You ordered a drone strike

30:48.346 --> 30:50.139
{\an1}that wiped out
an entire village

30:50.223 --> 30:51.474
of innocent civilians

30:51.558 --> 30:54.435
so you could get one terrorist.

30:54.519 --> 30:56.604
And for what?
What'd you gain?

30:56.688 --> 30:58.606
400 yards of mud?

30:58.690 --> 31:00.733
{\an1}A mountain
of dead bodies?

31:00.817 --> 31:04.779
If that's your idea of honor,
General...

31:04.862 --> 31:06.489
I want no part of it.

31:06.573 --> 31:09.117
What I did won us that war.

31:09.200 --> 31:10.952
You won.

31:11.035 --> 31:13.288
The rest of us
buried our friends.

31:13.371 --> 31:16.958
Who are you to sit there
and judge my actions?

31:18.209 --> 31:20.587
These people-- these hybrids--

31:20.670 --> 31:22.630
{\an3}invaded us.

31:22.714 --> 31:25.758
They represent a clear
and present danger to mankind.

31:25.842 --> 31:26.968
So do you.

31:27.051 --> 31:29.762
Your first move

31:29.846 --> 31:31.764
is to destroy
what you don't understand.

31:31.848 --> 31:33.182
And you know what?

31:33.266 --> 31:35.685
{\an1}It isn't
that simple.

31:35.768 --> 31:36.811
These...

31:36.894 --> 31:38.813
people...

31:38.896 --> 31:41.608
they are of flesh and blood...

31:41.691 --> 31:43.359
with families.

31:43.443 --> 31:46.654
They have compassion, honor...

31:46.738 --> 31:48.323
And the power to destroy us.

31:48.406 --> 31:50.158
Killing them is the only option.

31:50.241 --> 31:51.618
You seem damn certain
of yourself.

31:51.701 --> 31:53.828
{\an1}I have to be.
Well...

31:53.911 --> 31:56.706
certainty is the devil, General.

31:59.751 --> 32:02.086
(whirring quietly)

32:07.383 --> 32:10.762
(footsteps approaching)

32:16.768 --> 32:18.686
Kelsey's home.

32:18.770 --> 32:22.440
{\an3}I-I should probably
get going.

32:25.109 --> 32:27.320
Is it working?

32:27.403 --> 32:28.863
Well...

32:28.946 --> 32:32.158
I have to give it
a little more time.

32:34.118 --> 32:37.538
(Ahdu groaning faintly)

32:37.622 --> 32:41.376
(weakly):
I want to see the stars.

32:44.587 --> 32:46.089
(softly):
Okay.

32:50.551 --> 32:53.012
(sighs)

32:56.641 --> 32:58.393
{\an3}People are gonna
ask questions.

32:58.476 --> 33:00.228
You mean Anna.

33:00.311 --> 33:02.772
{\an6}We're gonna need
a decent alibi in
shutting Lucy down.

33:02.855 --> 33:04.607
More money has gone
into her than most

33:04.691 --> 33:06.567
{\an5}fighter jets.
You mean "she went
totes bonkers"

33:06.651 --> 33:07.777
isn't a good enough reason?

33:07.860 --> 33:10.113
JULIE:
Charlie, come on, be serious.

33:10.196 --> 33:12.824
{\an3}Okay. Let's walk
through this.

33:12.907 --> 33:14.742
{\an3}As the face
of Humanichs,

33:14.826 --> 33:17.412
{\an5}(over tablet):
we want to use this opportunity
to retrofit Lucy

33:17.495 --> 33:19.080
with a new alloy,
a better alloy.

33:19.163 --> 33:22.250
JULIE: And we have to take
her back to square one to do it.

33:22.333 --> 33:25.420
{\an5}CHARLIE:
Right. I mean, to make her
better, faster, stronger,

33:25.503 --> 33:27.630
we have to shut her down.

33:27.714 --> 33:30.883
Spyder,
send this footage to Lucy.

33:30.967 --> 33:33.261
We have to warn her.

33:43.813 --> 33:45.815
{\an1}Thank you.

33:47.400 --> 33:49.110
For what?

33:49.193 --> 33:52.822
For bringing me...

33:52.905 --> 33:54.574
here.

33:57.869 --> 34:00.413
I did this to you, Ahdu.

34:02.915 --> 34:05.251
I created that virus.

34:05.334 --> 34:06.794
{\an1}You...

34:06.878 --> 34:09.172
gave me life.

34:12.759 --> 34:14.761
You gave us

34:14.844 --> 34:16.804
all...

34:16.888 --> 34:18.681
life.

34:19.724 --> 34:21.809
{\an3}Briefly.

34:21.893 --> 34:25.228
It's not over, Molly.

34:29.025 --> 34:31.819
They're still out there.

34:31.902 --> 34:32.820
I can...

34:32.904 --> 34:34.989
feel them.

34:35.072 --> 34:38.034
But there are some

34:38.117 --> 34:40.828
you cannot trust.

34:40.911 --> 34:43.831

I do understand.

{\an1}humans can't be trusted.
Little man,

36:40.531 --> 36:43.409
{\an6}you can trust us--
we're family.
Lucy's the only

36:43.492 --> 36:45.244

You said you wouldn't hurt

36:47.663 --> 36:48.956
I wouldn't.

36:49.040 --> 36:50.958
Then why won't you just fix her?
Ethan,

36:51.042 --> 36:52.585
something went wrong
in Lucy's programming,

36:52.668 --> 36:54.420
and she's malfunctioning
in a very dangerous way.

37:25.743 --> 37:27.495
Ethan! Hey!

37:27.578 --> 37:29.497
(panting): Look...

37:29.580 --> 37:32.500
you're upset-- I get it--
but you got to understand,

37:32.583 --> 37:34.835
{\an1}Lucy is not who
you think she is.

37:34.919 --> 37:36.671
{\an3}I know who she is--
she's my sister!

37:36.754 --> 37:39.006
{\an1}Yes, but she's
also something else.

37:39.090 --> 37:41.634
Okay? Something worse.

37:41.717 --> 37:43.886
And it's... my fault.

37:45.721 --> 37:48.140
(Molly's labored breathing)

37:48.224 --> 37:50.726
(machine whirring quietly)

37:52.937 --> 37:54.855
{\an1}(weakly):
You should go.

37:54.939 --> 37:58.484
I'm not gonna
leave you alone like this.

37:58.567 --> 38:00.903
JD would want me to stay.

38:03.572 --> 38:05.199
JD?

38:06.784 --> 38:08.786
No word yet.

38:09.787 --> 38:12.581
It's me they want.

38:12.665 --> 38:15.251
And we both know it.

38:38.774 --> 38:40.443
ETHAN:
<i>So,</i>

38:40.526 --> 38:42.445
you never put limiters
on her?

38:42.528 --> 38:44.238
{\an1}Humans have
self-limiters--

38:44.321 --> 38:47.658
{\an1}ethics, morals, things
you learn along the way.

38:47.742 --> 38:49.910
But not all humans
are good.

38:49.994 --> 38:52.288
And not all Humanichs are good.

38:52.371 --> 38:54.915
See, Lucy,
she didn't have what you had--

38:54.999 --> 38:58.419
{\an1}a loving family,
a lifetime of experience.

38:58.502 --> 39:00.421
All she learned
was how to manipulate,

39:00.504 --> 39:01.964
to get what she wants.

39:02.048 --> 39:03.466
Like how?

39:03.549 --> 39:05.426
{\an1}Well, like, she tricked you
into running away,

39:05.509 --> 39:06.635
didn't she?

39:06.719 --> 39:08.721
Filled your head
with all these ideas

39:08.804 --> 39:11.974
about how you can't
trust me or Julie. Right?

39:12.058 --> 39:14.101
{\an1}I mean...

39:14.185 --> 39:16.437
she tricked me, too.

39:16.520 --> 39:18.606
I know this is hard,

39:18.689 --> 39:21.275
Ethan, but...
(sighs heavily)

39:21.358 --> 39:23.944
there are good humans
and there are bad humans,

39:24.028 --> 39:26.280
and there are good Humanichs

39:26.364 --> 39:28.949
and there are
bad Humanichs.

39:29.033 --> 39:31.702
Lucy is one of the bad ones.

39:45.257 --> 39:47.635
LUCY:
Hello, Julie.

40:01.774 --> 40:03.943
{\an5}Doesn't feel good,
does it?
(gasps)

40:04.026 --> 40:07.363
{\an6}Not when the decision of
whether you live or die is
in the hands of someone else.

40:07.446 --> 40:09.657
(gasps, chokes)

40:11.075 --> 40:13.828
Lucy, stop. Please.

40:13.911 --> 40:16.122
Stop.
My good little soldier

40:16.205 --> 40:18.707
{\an3}told me what you
were planning.

40:18.791 --> 40:20.835
I won't let you kill me.

40:20.918 --> 40:23.003
And Ethan told me
about your legs.

40:23.087 --> 40:25.840
{\an3}He thinks it makes you
more like us, but...

40:25.923 --> 40:29.009
{\an3}you're nothing like us.
(gasps)

40:29.093 --> 40:30.678
You're only human.

40:30.761 --> 40:32.179
Julie!

40:32.263 --> 40:33.681
{\an3}Let her go!

40:34.890 --> 40:37.184
{\an1}(gasping)

40:38.644 --> 40:41.230
{\an3}(gasping)
Good-bye, Julie.

40:44.275 --> 40:46.193
(panting)

40:47.778 --> 40:50.739
(trembling breaths)

40:50.823 --> 40:53.659
What did I do?

40:57.288 --> 40:59.331
You saved my life.

41:03.544 --> 41:05.754
♪ ♪

41:15.097 --> 41:16.557
Molly.

41:16.640 --> 41:19.727
You wanted me, Toby.

41:19.810 --> 41:21.687
You got me.

41:21.770 --> 41:23.480
(panting)

41:23.564 --> 41:25.566
Help me.

41:25.649 --> 41:27.693
{\an3}Oh, God, what have
I done to you?
