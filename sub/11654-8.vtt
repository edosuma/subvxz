DRAGON: Please hurry.

19:50.190 --> 19:53.527
I cannot stand much more.

20:27.936 --> 20:30.021
DRAGON: Thank you.

20:38.947 --> 20:39.948
(SQUEAKING)

20:51.543 --> 20:52.544
Look.

20:54.045 --> 20:55.630
TOWNSPEOPLE: Huzzah!

20:56.339 --> 20:58.759
(CHEERING)

21:02.220 --> 21:04.556
Well, I gotta hand it to you, robed one,

21:04.639 --> 21:07.142
I never thought you'd get rid
of that stench.

21:07.350 --> 21:09.519
MAN: Hurray! The smell is gone.

21:09.603 --> 21:10.729
We're saved.

21:12.731 --> 21:13.732
Hurray!

21:13.815 --> 21:16.151
At last, we can breath again.

21:16.693 --> 21:19.279
(PEOPLE CHEERING)

21:23.533 --> 21:26.328
Now, all I have to do
is put out these fires.

21:27.245 --> 21:28.246
At the right price,

21:28.330 --> 21:30.665
I can tell you how to put out this fire.

21:30.749 --> 21:32.709
(SQUAWK) Fire rhymes with liar.

21:33.835 --> 21:34.836
Why, you...

21:35.545 --> 21:37.798
You rotten, dusty bag of germs.
